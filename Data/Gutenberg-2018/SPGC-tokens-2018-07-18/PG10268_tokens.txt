chapter
i
the
debate
in
elliott
library
at
vernondale
a
great
discussion
was
going
on
it
was
an
evening
in
early
december
and
the
room
was
bright
with
firelight
and
electric
light
and
merry
with
the
laughter
and
talk
of
people
who
were
trying
to
decide
a
great
and
momentous
question
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
acquainted
with
patty
fairfield
and
her
relatives
it
may
be
well
to
say
that
elliott
was
patty
aunt
alice
at
whose
home
patty
and
her
father
were
now
visiting
of
the
other
members
of
the
elliott
family
uncle
charley
grandma
marian
and
frank
were
present
and
these
with
fairfield
and
patty
were
debating
a
no
less
important
subject
than
the
location
of
patty
future
home
you
know
papa
said
patty
you
said
that
if
i
wanted
to
live
in
vernondale
you
buy
a
house
here
and
i
do
want
to
live
here
at
least
i
am
almost
sure
i
do
oh
patty
said
marian
why
are
you
quite
sure
you
president
of
the
club
and
the
girls
are
all
so
fond
of
you
and
you
getting
along
so
well
in
school
i
do
see
where
else
you
could
want
to
live
i
know
said
frank
patty
wants
to
live
in
new
york
her
soul
yearns
for
the
gay
and
giddy
throng
and
the
halls
of
dazzling
lights
patricia
beware
the
rapids
are
below
you
as
it
says
in
that
thrilling
tale
in
the
third
reader
i
think
papa
would
rather
live
in
new
york
said
patty
looking
very
undecided
i
tell
you
what
we
do
exclaimed
frank
let
debate
the
question
a
regular
honest
debate
i
mean
and
we
have
all
the
arguments
for
and
against
clearly
stated
and
ably
discussed
uncle
fred
shall
be
the
judge
and
his
decision
must
be
final
no
said
fairfield
we
have
the
debate
but
patty
must
be
the
judge
she
is
the
one
most
interested
and
i
am
ready
to
give
her
a
home
wherever
she
wants
it
in
greenland
icy
mountains
or
india
coral
strand
if
she
chooses
you
certainly
are
a
disinterested
member
said
uncle
charley
laughing
but
that
wo
do
in
debate
here
i
organise
this
thing
and
for
the
present
we
wo
consider
either
greenland
or
india
the
question
as
i
understand
it
is
between
vernondale
and
new
york
now
to
bring
this
mighty
matter
properly
before
the
house
i
will
put
it
in
the
form
of
a
resolution
thus
resolved
that
miss
patty
fairfield
shall
take
up
her
permanent
abode
in
new
york
city
patty
gave
a
little
cry
of
dismay
and
marian
exclaimed
oh
father
that
is
fair
of
course
it
fair
said
elliott
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
it
does
really
mean
she
going
but
it
the
only
way
to
find
out
what
she
is
going
to
do
now
fred
shall
be
captain
on
the
affirmative
side
and
i
will
take
the
negative
we
will
each
choose
our
colleagues
fred
you
may
begin
all
right
said
fairfield
as
a
matter
of
social
etiquette
i
think
it
right
to
compliment
my
hostess
so
i
choose
elliott
on
my
side
oh
you
choose
me
father
cried
marian
do
choose
me
owing
to
certain
insidious
i
forced
to
choose
miss
marian
elliott
said
uncle
charley
pinching
his
daughter
ear
if
one
elliott
is
a
good
thing
said
fairfield
i
am
sure
two
would
be
better
and
so
i
choose
grandma
elliott
to
add
to
my
collection
of
great
minds
frank
my
son
said
uncle
charley
do
think
for
a
moment
that
i
am
choosing
you
merely
because
you
are
the
last
of
the
mohicans
far
from
it
i
have
wanted
you
from
the
beginning
and
i
proud
to
impress
your
noble
intellect
in
my
cause
thank
you
sir
said
frank
and
if
our
side
ca
induce
patty
to
stay
in
vernondale
it
wo
be
for
lack
of
good
strong
arguments
forcibly
presented
modest
boy
said
his
mother
you
seem
quite
to
forget
your
wise
and
clever
opponents
in
great
glee
the
debaters
took
their
places
on
either
side
of
the
library
table
while
patty
being
judge
was
escorted
with
much
ceremony
to
a
seat
at
the
head
an
old
mallet
was
found
for
her
with
which
she
rapped
on
the
table
after
the
manner
of
a
grave
and
dignified
chairman
the
meeting
will
please
come
to
order
she
said
and
the
secretary
will
please
read
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
the
secretary
regrets
to
report
said
frank
rising
that
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
fell
down
the
well
although
rescued
they
were
afterward
chewed
up
by
the
puppy
and
are
at
present
somewhat
illegible
if
the
honourable
judge
will
excuse
the
reading
of
the
minutes
the
secretary
will
be
greatly
obliged
the
minutes
are
excused
said
patty
and
we
will
proceed
at
once
to
more
important
business
frederick
fairfield
we
shall
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
fairfield
rose
and
said
your
honour
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
would
be
glad
to
speak
definitely
on
this
burning
question
but
the
truth
is
i
do
know
myself
which
way
i
want
it
to
be
decided
for
you
see
my
only
desire
in
the
matter
is
that
the
wise
and
honourable
judge
whom
we
see
before
us
should
have
a
home
of
such
a
character
and
in
such
a
place
as
best
pleases
her
but
before
she
makes
her
decision
i
hope
she
will
allow
herself
to
be
thoroughly
convinced
as
to
what
will
please
her
and
as
by
force
of
circumstance
i
am
obliged
to
uphold
the
new
york
side
of
this
argument
i
will
now
set
forth
some
of
its
advantages
feeling
sure
that
my
worthy
opponents
are
quite
able
to
uphold
the
vernondale
side
hear
hear
exclaimed
frank
but
patty
rapped
with
her
mallet
and
commanded
silence
then
fairfield
went
on
for
one
thing
patty
has
always
lived
in
a
city
and
like
myself
is
accustomed
to
city
life
it
is
more
congenial
to
both
of
us
and
i
sometimes
fear
we
should
miss
certain
city
privileges
which
may
not
be
found
in
a
suburban
town
but
we
have
other
things
that
you
ca
get
in
the
city
broke
in
marian
and
i
am
very
sure
that
they
will
be
enthusiastically
enumerated
when
it
is
your
turn
to
speak
said
fairfield
smiling
the
gentleman
has
the
floor
remarked
patty
the
others
will
please
keep
their
seats
proceed
mr
fairfield
so
fairfield
proceeded
other
advantages
perhaps
will
be
found
in
the
superior
schools
which
the
city
is
said
to
contain
i
am
making
no
allusion
to
the
school
that
our
honourable
judge
is
at
present
attending
but
i
am
speaking
merely
on
general
principles
and
not
only
schools
but
masters
of
the
various
arts
i
have
been
led
to
believe
by
the
assertions
of
some
people
who
however
may
be
prejudiced
that
miss
fairfield
has
a
voice
which
requires
only
training
and
practise
to
rival
the
voice
of
adelina
patti
when
that
lady
was
miss
fairfield
age
quite
true
said
the
judge
nodding
gravely
at
the
speaker
this
phenomenal
voice
then
might
mind
i
say
might
be
cultivated
to
better
purpose
by
metropolitan
teachers
we
have
a
fine
here
exclaimed
frank
but
patty
rapped
him
to
silence
what
one
among
a
voice
like
miss
fairfield
demanded
the
speaker
and
another
thing
he
continued
that
ought
to
affect
you
vernondale
people
very
strongly
is
the
fact
that
you
would
have
a
delightful
place
to
visit
in
new
york
city
now
do
deny
it
you
know
you
be
glad
to
come
and
visit
patty
and
me
in
our
mansion
and
we
would
take
you
around
to
see
all
the
sights
from
grant
tomb
to
the
aquarium
we
seen
those
murmured
frank
they
still
there
said
fairfield
and
there
will
probably
be
some
other
and
newer
entertainments
that
you
have
yet
seen
it
does
sound
nice
said
frank
and
finally
went
on
fairfield
though
i
do
not
wish
this
argument
to
have
undue
weight
it
certainly
would
be
more
convenient
for
me
to
live
in
the
city
i
am
about
to
start
in
business
there
and
though
i
could
go
in
and
out
every
day
as
the
honourable
gentleman
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
does
yet
he
is
accustomed
to
it
and
as
i
am
not
it
seems
to
me
an
uninteresting
performance
however
i
dare
say
i
could
get
used
to
a
commutation
ticket
and
i
am
certainly
willing
to
try
all
of
which
is
respectfully
submitted
and
with
a
bow
the
speaker
resumed
his
seat
that
was
a
very
nice
speech
said
the
judge
approvingly
and
now
we
would
be
pleased
to
hear
from
the
captain
gentleman
on
the
other
side
uncle
charley
rose
without
wishing
to
be
discourteous
he
said
i
must
say
that
i
think
the
arguments
just
set
forth
are
exceedingly
flimsy
there
can
be
no
question
but
that
vernondale
would
be
a
far
better
and
more
appropriate
home
for
the
young
lady
in
question
than
any
other
spot
on
the
globe
here
we
have
wide
streets
green
lawns
fresh
air
and
bright
sunshine
all
conducive
to
that
blooming
state
of
health
which
our
honourable
judge
now
apparently
enjoys
city
life
would
doubtless
soon
reduce
her
to
a
thin
pale
peaked
specimen
of
humanity
unrecognisable
by
her
friends
the
in
her
cheeks
would
turn
to
ashen
grey
her
starry
eyes
would
become
dim
and
lustreless
her
robust
flesh
would
dwindle
to
skin
and
bone
and
probably
her
hair
would
all
fall
out
and
she
have
to
wear
a
wig
even
patty
mallet
was
not
able
to
check
the
burst
of
laughter
caused
by
the
horrible
picture
which
uncle
charley
drew
but
after
it
had
subsided
he
continued
as
to
the
wonderful
masters
and
teachers
in
the
city
far
be
it
from
me
to
deny
their
greatness
and
power
but
the
beautiful
village
of
vernondale
is
less
than
an
hour
from
new
york
no
mosquitoes
no
malaria
boating
bathing
and
fishing
miss
fairfield
could
therefore
go
to
new
york
for
her
instructions
in
the
various
arts
and
sciences
and
return
again
to
her
vernondale
home
on
a
local
train
add
to
this
the
fact
that
here
she
has
relatives
friends
and
acquaintances
who
already
know
and
love
her
while
in
new
york
she
would
have
to
acquire
a
whole
new
set
probably
have
to
advertise
for
them
as
to
the
commuting
gentleman
before
his
first
ticket
was
all
punched
up
he
would
be
ready
to
vow
that
the
commuter
life
is
the
only
ideal
existence
having
thus
offered
unattackable
arguments
i
deem
a
decision
in
our
favour
a
foregone
conclusion
and
i
take
pleasure
in
sitting
down
a
very
successful
speech
said
patty
smiling
at
her
uncle
we
will
now
be
pleased
to
hear
from
the
next
speaker
on
the
affirmative
side
charles
elliott
will
you
kindly
speak
what
is
on
your
mind
i
will
said
elliott
with
a
nod
of
her
head
that
betokened
fairfield
decision
of
character
i
will
say
exactly
what
is
on
my
mind
without
regard
to
which
side
i
am
on
oh
that
is
fair
cried
patty
a
debate
is
a
debate
you
know
and
you
must
make
up
opinions
for
your
own
side
whether
you
think
them
or
not
very
well
said
aunt
alice
smiling
a
little
then
it
being
thoroughly
understood
that
i
am
not
speaking
the
truth
i
will
say
that
i
think
it
better
for
patty
to
live
in
new
york
as
her
father
will
be
away
all
day
at
his
business
she
will
enjoy
the
loneliness
of
a
big
city
house
she
will
enjoy
the
dark
rooms
and
the
entire
absence
of
grass
and
flowers
and
trees
which
she
hates
anyway
instead
of
picnics
and
boating
parties
she
can
go
to
stiff
and
formal
afternoon
teas
and
instead
of
attending
her
young
people
club
here
she
can
become
a
member
of
the
society
of
social
economics
with
an
air
of
having
accomplished
her
intention
aunt
alice
sat
down
amid
great
cheers
and
handclappings
from
the
opposite
side
patty
looked
a
little
sober
as
she
began
to
think
the
vernondale
home
would
win
and
though
for
many
reasons
she
wished
it
would
be
so
yet
at
the
same
time
she
realised
very
strongly
the
attractions
of
life
in
new
york
city
however
she
only
said
the
meeting
will
please
come
to
order
in
order
to
listen
to
the
opinions
of
miss
elliott
marian
rose
with
great
dignity
and
addressed
the
chair
and
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
with
true
parliamentary
punctiliousness
though
personally
interested
in
this
matter
she
began
it
is
not
my
intention
to
allow
my
own
wishes
or
prejudices
to
blind
me
to
the
best
interests
of
our
young
friend
who
is
now
under
discussion
far
be
it
from
me
to
blight
her
career
for
the
benefit
of
my
own
unworthy
self
but
i
will
say
that
if
patty
fairfield
goes
to
live
in
new
york
or
anywhere
except
vernondale
i
think
she
just
the
horridest
meanest
old
thing
on
the
face
of
the
earth
why
i
would
her
go
i
lock
her
in
her
room
and
poke
bread
and
water
to
her
through
the
keyhole
if
she
dared
to
think
of
such
a
thing
go
to
new
york
indeed
a
nice
time
she
have
hanging
on
straps
in
the
and
getting
run
over
by
automobiles
the
whole
thing
is
so
perfectly
absurd
that
there
no
earthly
chance
of
its
ever
coming
to
pass
why
she
go
she
could
be
to
go
she
would
be
happy
there
a
minute
but
if
she
go
i
go
too
chapter
ii
the
decision
hooray
for
our
side
cried
frank
as
marian
dropped
into
a
chair
after
her
outburst
of
enthusiasm
oh
i
have
finished
yet
said
marian
jumping
up
again
i
want
to
remark
further
that
not
only
is
patty
going
to
live
in
vernondale
but
she
going
to
have
a
house
very
near
this
one
i
picked
it
out
and
marian
wagged
her
head
with
the
air
of
a
mysterious
sibyl
i
wo
tell
you
where
it
is
just
yet
but
it
a
lovely
house
and
big
enough
to
accommodate
uncle
fred
and
patty
and
a
guest
or
two
besides
selected
the
room
that
i
prefer
and
i
hope
you
will
furnish
it
in
blue
the
speaker
is
a
bit
hasty
said
patty
as
marian
sat
down
again
we
ca
furnish
any
rooms
before
this
debate
is
concluded
and
though
we
deeply
regret
it
miss
elliott
will
be
obliged
to
wait
for
her
blue
room
until
the
other
speakers
have
had
their
speak
but
patty
smiled
at
marian
understandingly
and
began
to
have
a
very
attractive
mental
picture
of
her
cousin
blue
room
next
her
own
the
next
speaker
announced
the
judge
will
be
elliott
senior
the
dowager
duchess
your
grace
we
would
be
pleased
to
hear
from
you
i
do
know
said
grandma
elliott
looking
rather
seriously
into
the
smiling
faces
before
her
that
i
am
entirely
in
favour
of
the
country
home
i
think
our
patty
would
greatly
enjoy
the
city
atmosphere
she
is
a
schoolgirl
now
but
in
a
year
or
two
she
will
be
a
young
woman
and
one
well
deserving
of
the
best
that
can
be
given
to
her
i
am
myself
and
though
at
my
age
i
prefer
the
quiet
of
the
country
yet
for
a
young
girl
i
well
know
the
charm
of
a
city
life
of
course
we
would
all
regret
the
loss
of
our
patty
who
has
grown
to
be
a
part
of
our
daily
life
but
nevertheless
were
i
to
vote
on
this
matter
i
should
unhesitatingly
cast
my
ballot
in
favour
of
new
york
bravo
for
grandma
cried
frank
give
me
a
lady
who
fearlessly
speaks
her
mind
even
in
the
face
of
overwhelming
opposition
all
the
same
i
have
spoken
my
piece
yet
and
i
believe
it
is
now
my
turn
it
is
said
patty
and
we
eagerly
await
your
sapient
and
authoritative
remarks
ahem
said
frank
pompously
as
he
arose
my
remarks
shall
be
brief
but
very
much
to
the
point
patty
home
must
be
in
vernondale
because
we
live
here
if
ever
we
go
to
live
in
new
york
or
oshkosh
or
kalamazoo
patty
can
pick
up
her
things
and
go
along
just
get
that
idea
firmly
fixed
in
your
heads
my
friends
where
we
live
patty
lives
whither
she
goeth
we
goeth
therefore
if
patty
should
go
to
new
york
the
elliotts
will
take
up
bag
and
baggage
sell
the
farm
and
go
likewise
to
new
york
now
i
sure
our
patty
being
of
proper
and
sound
judgment
would
put
the
elliott
family
to
such
inconvenience
for
moving
is
a
large
and
fearsome
proposition
thus
we
see
that
as
the
mountain
insists
on
following
mahomet
whithersoever
she
goest
the
only
decently
polite
thing
for
mahomet
to
do
is
to
settle
in
vernondale
i
regret
exceedingly
that
i
am
forced
to
express
an
opinion
so
diametrically
opposed
to
the
advices
of
her
grace
the
dowager
duchess
but
i
quite
sure
she
realise
what
a
bother
it
would
be
for
the
elliotts
to
move
and
now
having
convinced
you
all
to
my
way
of
thinking
i
will
leave
the
case
in
the
hands
of
our
wise
and
competent
judge
wait
said
uncle
charley
i
believe
the
captains
are
usually
allowed
a
sort
of
speech
are
they
not
they
are
in
this
case
anyway
said
patty
elliott
will
please
go
ahead
with
his
well
said
uncle
charley
the
sum
of
the
whole
matter
seems
to
be
that
we
all
want
fred
and
patty
to
live
here
because
we
want
them
to
but
of
course
it
only
fair
that
they
consult
their
own
wishes
in
the
matter
and
if
they
conclude
that
they
prefer
new
york
why
we
have
another
debate
that
all
uncle
charley
sat
down
and
fairfield
rose
i
have
listened
with
great
interest
to
the
somewhat
flattering
remarks
of
my
esteemed
fellow
members
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
agreeable
to
her
judgeship
a
compromise
might
be
effected
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
a
decision
should
be
arrived
at
for
the
vernondale
home
the
fairfields
could
manage
to
reap
some
few
of
those
mysterious
advantages
said
to
be
found
in
city
life
by
going
to
new
york
and
staying
a
few
months
every
winter
this
too
would
give
them
an
opportunity
to
receive
visits
from
the
elliott
family
which
would
i
sure
be
a
pleasure
and
profit
to
all
concerned
with
this
suggestion
i
am
quite
ready
to
hear
a
positive
and
final
decision
from
her
honour
the
judge
and
it
wo
take
her
long
to
make
up
her
mind
either
cried
patty
i
knew
you
fix
it
somehow
papa
you
are
the
best
and
wisest
man
solomon
was
in
it
with
you
nor
solon
nor
socrates
nor
anybody
that
arrangement
is
exactly
what
i
choose
and
suits
me
perfectly
i
do
want
to
stay
in
new
york
sometimes
but
i
would
much
rather
live
in
vernondale
so
the
judge
hereby
announces
that
on
the
merits
of
the
case
the
question
is
decided
in
the
negative
the
fairfields
will
buy
a
house
in
vernondale
and
the
judge
hopes
that
they
will
buy
it
quick
three
cheers
for
patty
and
uncle
fred
cried
frank
and
while
they
were
being
given
with
a
will
marian
flew
to
the
telephone
and
when
the
cheers
subsided
she
was
engaged
in
a
conversation
of
which
the
debating
club
heard
only
one
side
is
this
you
elsie
what
do
you
think
patty
going
to
stay
in
vernondale
yes
indeed
perfectly
gorgeous
just
this
evening
just
now
i
guess
i
am
i
so
glad
i
do
know
what
to
do
oh
yes
of
course
she
keep
on
being
president
no
they
have
decided
yet
but
i
want
them
to
take
the
bigelow
house
yes
would
it
be
fine
oh
it
is
very
late
well
come
over
early
morning
then
elsie
morris
is
delighted
said
marian
as
she
hung
up
the
receiver
and
polly
stevens
will
just
dance
jigs
of
joy
when
she
hears
about
it
i
call
her
up
now
only
i
afraid
she
break
the
telephone
trying
to
express
her
enthusiasm
she
flutters
so
you
can
tell
her
about
it
said
frank
and
now
talk
about
where
the
house
shall
be
would
you
rather
buy
or
build
uncle
fred
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
rent
said
fairfield
suppose
my
fickle
daughter
should
change
her
mind
and
after
a
visit
in
the
city
decide
that
she
prefers
it
for
her
home
i
not
fickle
papa
said
patty
and
it
all
arranged
all
right
just
as
it
is
but
i
do
want
a
rented
house
they
wo
let
you
drive
tacks
in
the
walls
or
anything
like
that
let
buy
a
house
and
then
if
you
turn
fickle
and
want
to
move
away
we
can
sell
it
again
all
right
said
fairfield
obligingly
what
house
shall
we
buy
i
know
just
the
one
cried
marian
guess
where
it
is
would
you
by
any
chance
refer
to
the
bigelow
house
inquired
frank
politely
how
did
you
know
exclaimed
marian
i
only
heard
that
it
is
for
sale
and
i
wanted
to
surprise
you
well
next
time
you
have
a
surprise
in
store
for
us
said
frank
announce
it
to
elsie
morris
over
the
telephone
oh
did
you
hear
that
as
a
rule
sister
dear
unless
you
are
the
matron
of
a
deaf
and
dumb
asylum
you
must
expect
those
present
to
hear
your
end
of
a
telephone
conversation
of
course
said
marian
i
did
think
but
really
would
the
bigelow
house
be
fine
only
a
few
blocks
away
from
here
and
such
a
lovely
house
with
a
barn
and
a
conservatory
and
a
little
arbour
in
the
garden
patty
began
to
look
frightened
goodness
gracious
me
she
exclaimed
i
do
believe
i
realise
what
i
coming
to
i
could
take
care
of
the
little
arbour
in
the
garden
but
i
wonder
if
i
could
manage
a
house
and
a
barn
and
a
conservatory
and
go
to
school
every
day
besides
said
her
father
laughing
i
think
my
child
that
at
least
until
your
school
days
are
over
we
will
engage
the
services
of
a
responsible
housekeeper
oh
papa
cried
patty
in
dismay
you
said
i
could
keep
house
for
you
and
aunt
alice
has
taught
me
lots
about
it
and
she
teach
me
lots
more
and
you
know
i
can
make
good
pumpkin
pies
and
of
course
i
can
dust
and
fly
and
that
about
all
there
is
to
housekeeping
anyway
oh
patty
said
aunt
alice
my
lessons
must
have
fallen
on
stony
ground
if
you
think
that
all
there
is
to
housekeeping
that
merely
a
figure
of
speech
aunt
alice
replied
patty
you
well
know
i
am
a
thoroughly
capable
and
experienced
housekeeper
honest
steady
and
with
a
fine
reference
from
my
last
place
you
certainly
a
clever
little
housekeeper
for
your
age
said
her
aunt
but
i
not
sure
you
could
keep
house
successfully
and
go
to
school
and
practice
your
music
and
attend
to
your
club
all
at
the
same
time
but
i
would
do
them
all
at
the
same
time
aunt
alice
i
have
a
time
for
everything
and
everything
in
it
place
i
would
go
to
school
and
practise
and
housekeep
and
club
all
in
their
proper
proportions
here
patty
glanced
at
her
father
you
see
if
i
had
the
proportions
right
all
would
go
well
well
perhaps
said
fairfield
if
we
had
a
competent
cook
and
a
tidy
little
waitress
we
could
get
along
without
a
professional
housekeeper
i
admit
i
had
hoped
to
have
patty
keep
house
for
me
and
preside
at
my
table
and
at
any
rate
it
would
do
no
harm
to
try
it
as
an
experiment
then
if
it
failed
we
could
make
some
other
arrangement
i
guess
i
do
want
to
sit
at
the
head
of
our
table
papa
said
patty
i
just
like
to
see
a
housekeeper
there
a
prim
old
lady
with
a
black
silk
dress
and
dangling
no
i
thank
you
if
i
have
my
way
i
will
keep
that
house
myself
and
when
i
get
into
any
trouble
i
will
fly
to
aunt
alice
for
rest
and
refreshment
we
all
help
said
marian
i
make
lovely
for
you
and
i
sure
grandma
will
knit
you
an
afghan
that
is
much
towards
housekeeping
said
frank
i
come
over
next
summer
and
swing
your
hammock
for
you
and
put
up
your
and
meantime
said
uncle
charley
until
the
house
is
bought
and
furnished
the
fairfield
family
will
be
the
welcome
guests
of
the
elliotts
it
almost
the
middle
of
december
now
and
i
do
think
miss
patty
fairfield
that
you
get
your
home
settled
in
time
to
make
a
visit
in
new
york
winter
and
now
you
youngsters
run
to
bed
while
i
discuss
some
plans
sensibly
with
my
and
fellow
townsman
chapter
iii
the
tea
club
well
i
should
think
you
better
stay
in
vernondale
patty
fairfield
if
you
know
what
good
for
yourself
why
if
you
had
attempted
to
leave
this
town
we
would
have
mobbed
you
with
tar
and
feathers
or
whatever
those
dreadful
things
are
that
they
do
to
the
most
awful
criminals
oh
if
i
had
gone
polly
i
should
have
taken
this
club
with
me
of
course
i
so
used
to
it
now
i
sure
i
could
live
a
day
and
know
that
we
should
meet
no
more
as
the
arab
remarked
to
his
beautiful
horse
it
would
be
rather
fun
to
be
transported
bodily
to
new
york
as
a
club
but
i
want
to
be
transported
home
again
after
the
meeting
said
helen
preston
why
should
we
do
that
cried
florence
douglass
it
would
be
lots
of
fun
for
the
whole
club
to
go
to
new
york
some
day
together
i
so
glad
patty
is
going
to
stay
with
us
i
do
care
what
we
do
said
ethel
holmes
who
was
drawing
pictures
on
patty
white
cuffs
as
a
mark
of
affection
i
glad
too
said
patty
and
ethel
your
kittens
are
perfectly
lovely
but
this
is
my
last
clean
and
those
are
awfully
hard
to
wash
out
i
do
mean
them
to
be
washed
out
said
ethel
calmly
going
on
with
her
art
work
they
not
wash
drawings
they
permanent
decorations
for
your
cuffs
and
are
offered
as
a
token
of
deep
regard
and
esteem
the
tea
club
was
holding
a
saturday
afternoon
meeting
at
polly
house
and
the
conversation
as
yet
had
not
strayed
far
from
the
subject
of
patty
future
plans
the
tea
club
had
begun
its
existence
with
lofty
and
noble
aims
in
a
literary
direction
to
be
supplemented
and
assisted
by
an
occasional
social
cup
of
tea
but
if
you
have
had
any
experience
with
merry
healthy
young
girls
of
about
sixteen
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
the
literary
element
had
softly
and
suddenly
vanished
away
much
after
the
manner
of
a
boojum
then
somehow
the
social
interest
grew
stronger
and
the
tea
element
held
its
own
and
the
result
was
a
most
satisfactory
club
if
not
an
instructive
one
but
as
polly
stevens
had
said
we
are
instructed
all
day
long
in
school
and
a
good
deal
out
of
school
too
for
that
matter
and
what
we
need
most
is
absolutely
foolish
recreation
the
foolisher
the
better
and
so
the
saturday
afternoon
meetings
had
developed
into
merely
merry
frolics
with
a
cup
of
tea
which
was
often
a
figure
of
speech
for
chocolate
or
lemonade
at
the
close
there
were
no
rules
and
the
girls
took
pleasure
in
calling
themselves
unruly
members
there
were
no
dues
and
consequently
no
occasion
for
a
secretary
or
treasures
patty
continued
to
be
called
the
president
but
the
title
meant
nothing
more
than
the
fact
that
she
was
really
a
chief
favourite
among
the
girls
no
one
was
bound
or
even
expected
to
attend
the
meetings
unless
she
chose
but
as
a
rule
a
large
majority
of
the
club
was
present
and
so
in
the
library
at
polly
stevens
house
nine
members
of
the
tea
club
were
chattering
like
nine
large
and
enthusiastic
magpies
now
we
can
go
on
with
the
entertainment
said
lillian
desmond
as
she
sat
on
the
arm
of
patty
chair
curling
wisps
of
the
presidential
hair
over
her
fingers
if
patty
had
gone
away
i
should
have
resigned
my
part
in
the
show
and
gone
into
a
convent
where
are
you
going
to
live
patty
i
do
know
i
am
sure
we
have
selected
a
house
yet
and
if
we
do
find
one
we
like
papa
may
build
one
though
i
believe
marian
has
one
all
picked
out
for
us
yes
i
have
said
marian
it
the
bigelow
house
on
our
street
i
do
want
to
keep
patty
near
us
the
bigelow
house
why
that
too
large
for
two
people
patty
and
fairfield
would
get
lost
in
it
now
i
know
a
much
nicer
one
there
a
little
house
to
us
a
lovely
little
cottage
that
would
suit
you
a
lot
better
tell
your
father
about
it
patty
it
for
sale
or
rent
and
it
just
the
dearest
place
why
laura
russell
cried
marian
that
little
snip
of
a
house
it
would
hold
patty
let
alone
uncle
fred
you
only
proposed
it
because
you
want
patty
to
live
to
you
yes
that
it
said
laura
quite
unabashed
i
know
it
too
little
but
you
could
add
ells
and
and
wings
and
things
and
then
it
would
be
big
enough
would
it
hold
the
tea
club
said
patty
i
must
have
room
for
them
you
know
oh
wo
it
be
fun
to
have
the
tea
club
at
patty
house
cried
elsie
i
had
thought
of
that
what
a
home
without
a
tea
club
said
patty
i
shall
select
the
house
with
an
eye
single
to
the
glory
and
comfort
of
you
girls
then
i
know
of
a
lovely
house
said
christine
converse
it
awfully
big
and
it
pretty
old
but
i
guess
it
could
be
fixed
up
i
mean
the
old
warner
place
good
gracious
cried
ethel
out
there
and
it
nothing
but
a
old
barn
anyhow
oh
i
think
it
lovely
and
it
colonial
or
revolutionary
or
something
historic
and
they
going
to
put
the
trolley
out
there
this
spring
my
father
said
so
it
is
a
nice
old
house
said
patty
and
it
could
be
made
awfully
pretty
and
quaint
i
can
see
it
now
in
my
mind
eye
with
dimity
curtains
at
the
windows
and
roses
growing
over
the
porch
i
hope
you
will
never
see
those
dimity
curtains
anywhere
but
in
your
mind
eye
said
marian
it
a
heathenish
old
place
and
anyway
too
far
away
from
our
house
papa
says
i
can
have
a
pony
and
cart
said
patty
and
i
could
drive
over
every
day
a
pony
and
cart
exclaimed
helen
preston
wo
that
be
perfectly
lovely
i
always
wanted
one
of
my
own
and
shall
you
have
and
oh
patty
you
never
could
run
a
big
establishment
like
that
you
have
to
have
a
housekeeper
i
going
to
try
it
said
patty
laughing
it
will
be
an
experiment
and
of
course
i
shall
make
lots
of
blunders
at
first
but
i
think
it
a
pity
if
a
girl
nearly
sixteen
years
old
ca
keep
house
for
her
own
father
so
do
i
said
laura
and
anyhow
if
you
get
into
any
dilemmas
all
come
over
and
help
you
out
the
girls
laughed
at
this
for
laura
russell
was
a
giddy
little
and
could
have
kept
house
for
ten
minutes
to
save
her
life
much
good
it
would
do
patty
to
have
the
tea
club
help
her
keep
house
said
florence
douglass
but
we
all
make
her
lovely
things
to
go
to
housekeeping
with
i
shall
be
real
sensible
and
make
her
and
oh
i
can
beat
that
for
sensibleness
cried
ethel
holmes
i
read
about
it
the
other
day
and
it
a
i
have
an
idea
what
it
for
but
i
find
out
and
i
make
one
one

good
said
marian
sagely

her
a
dozen
while
about
it
oh

come
by
dozens
said
ethel
in
an
awestruck
voice
well
i
guess
i
wo
make
them
then
i
make
her
something
pretty
a
pincushion
all
over
lace
and
pin
ribbons
or
something
like
that
that
will
be
lovely
said
laura
i
shall
embroider
her
a
tablecloth
you
never
finish
it
said
patty
who
well
knew
how
soon
bursts
of
enthusiasm
spent
themselves
you
better
decide
on
a
doily
better
a
doily
done
than
a
tablecloth
but
begun
oh
i
tell
we
can
do
girls
said
polly
stevens

christine

thing

lillian
desmond

in
a
fair
way
to
get
hemstitched
said
patty
you
can
put
a
double
row
around
it
if
you

and
i
be
awfully
glad
to
have
it
i
use
it
the
first
saturday
afternoon
after
i
get
settled
i
wish
i
knew
where
you
going
to
live
said
ethel
i
like
to
have
a
correct
mental
picture
of
that
first
saturday
afternoon
it
a
beautiful
day
for
walking
said
polly
stevens
let
all
go
out
and
take
a
look
at
the
warner
place
something
tells
me
that
decide
to
live
there
i
hope
something
else
will
tell
you
differently
soon
said
marian
for
i
never
give
my
consent
to
that
arrangement
however
i
just
as
lieve
walk
out
there
if
only
to
convince
you
what
a
forlorn
old
place
it
is
come
on
let
go
then
we
can
be
back
in
an
hour
and
have
tea
afterwards
i
get
the
key
from
martin
as
we
go
by
like
a
bombarding
army
the
tea
club
stormed
the
old
warner
house
and
once
inside
its
colonial
portal
they
made
the
old
walls
ring
with
their
laughter
the
wide
hall
was
dark
and
gloomy
until
elsie
morris
flung
open
the
door
at
the
other
end
and
let
in
the
december
sunshine
seek
no
farther
she
cried
dramatically
we
have
crossed
the
rubicon
and
found
the
golden
fleece
this
is
the
place
of
all
others
for
our
tea
club
meeting
and
it
does
matter
what
the
rest
of
the
house
may
be
like
patty
you
will
kindly
consider
the
matter
settled
i
consider
anything
you
like
said
patty
and
before
breakfast
too
if
you
only
hurry
up
and
get
out
of
this
damp
musty
old
place
i
shivering
myself
to
pieces
oh
it
is
cold
said
laura
russell
and
while
we
here
let
go
through
the
house
yes
said
marian
examine
it
carefully
lest
some
of
its
numerous
advantages
should
escape
your
notice
observe
the
hardwood
floors
the
magnificent
mahogany
and
the
lofty
ceilings
the
old
floors
were
creaky
and
dusty
the
was
in
a
most
dilapidated
condition
and
the
ceilings
were
low
and
smoky
so
marian
scored
her
points
but
it
is
antique
said
ethel
holmes
with
the
air
of
an
auctioneer
ah
ladies
what
would
you
have
it
is
a
fine
specimen
of
the
colonial
empire
period
picked
out
here
and
there
with
queen
anne
the
mantels
ah
the
mantels
are
dreams
in
marble
nightmares
in
painted
wood
you
mean
said
lillian
but
so
roomy
and
expansive
went
on
ethel
and
the
note
the
fine
stage
of
complete
dilapidation
left
by
the
moving
finger
of
time
the
are
all
right
said
patty
they
look
as
if
they
peel
off
easily
come
on
upstairs
the
chambers
were
large
low
and
rambling
and
the
house
in
its
best
days
must
have
been
an
interesting
specimen
of
its
type
but
after
a
short
investigation
patty
was
as
firmly
convinced
as
marian
that
its
charms
could
not
offset
its
drawbacks
i
seen
enough
of
this
moated
grange
cried
patty
come
on
girls
we
going
back
to
tea
right
straight
smack
off
there
no
pleasing
some
folks
grumbled
ethel
here
an
ancestral
pile
only
waiting
for
somebody
to
ancestralise
it
you
could
make
it
one
of
the
historic
homes
of
vernondale
and
you
wo
even
consider
it
for
a
minute
i
consider
it
for
a
minute
said
patty
if
that
will
do
you
any
good
but
not
a
bit
longer
and
as
the
minute
is
nearly
up
i
move
we
start
chapter
iv
boxley
hall
after
consultation
with
various
real
estate
agents
and
after
due
consideration
of
the
desirable
houses
they
had
to
offer
fairfield
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
bigelow
house
which
marian
had
suggested
was
perhaps
the
most
attractive
of
any
and
so
one
afternoon
a
party
of
very
interested
people
went
over
to
look
at
it
the
procession
was
headed
by
patty
and
marian
followed
by
fairfield
and
aunt
alice
while
frank
and
his
father
brought
up
the
rear
but
as
they
were
going
out
of
the
elliotts
front
gate
laura
russell
came
flying
across
the
street
where
are
all
you
people
going
she
cried
i
know
you
going
to
look
at
a
house
which
one
the
bigelow
house
said
marian
and
i
almost
sure
uncle
fred
will
decide
to
take
it
come
on
with
us
we
going
all
through
it
no
said
laura
looking
disappointed
i
do
want
to
go
and
i
want
the
fairfields
to
live
in
that
house
anyway
if
they
would
only
look
at
that
little
cottage
to
us
i
know
they
like
it
ever
so
much
better
oh
please
fairfield
wo
you
come
over
and
look
at
it
now
it
so
pretty
and
cunning
and
it
has
the
loveliest
garden
and
and
everything
i
do
want
a
said
patty
laughing
i
no
chickens
and
i
do
want
any
our
chickens
are
over
there
most
of
the
time
said
laura
then
of
course
we
ought
to
have
a
coop
to
keep
our
chickens
in
said
fairfield
and
if
this
cottage
is
as
delightful
as
miss
russell
makes
it
out
i
think
it
our
duty
at
least
to
go
and
look
at
it
if
the
rest
of
you
are
willing
suppose
we
go
over
there
first
and
then
if
we
decide
not
to
take
it
we
have
time
to
investigate
the
bigelow
afterward
marian
looked
so
that
patty
laughed
cheer
up
girl
she
said
there
is
one
chance
in
a
million
of
our
taking
that
doll
house
but
laura
will
never
give
us
a
minute
peace
until
we
go
and
look
at
it
so
we
may
as
well
go
now
and
get
it
over
all
right
said
marian
and
patty
with
her
two
girl
friends
on
either
side
of
her
started
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
but
when
they
reached
it
fairfield
exclaimed
in
amazement
that
little
house
he
said
oh
i
see
that
the
you
spoke
of
well
where
is
the
house
this
is
the
house
said
laura
but
somehow
it
does
look
smaller
than
usual
still
it
a
great
deal
bigger
inside
no
doubt
said
frank
i
often
noticed
that
the
inside
of
a
house
is
much
larger
than
the
outside
of
course
we
ca
all
go
in
at
once
but
i
willing
to
wait
my
turn
who
will
go
first
very
well
you
may
stay
outside
said
laura
i
think
the
rest
of
us
can
all
squeeze
in
at
once
if
we
try
but
frank
followed
the
rest
of
the
party
and
passing
through
the
narrow
hall
they
entered
the
tiny
parlour
i
never
was
in
such
a
crowded
room
said
marian
i
can
scarcely
get
my
breath
i
had
no
idea
there
were
so
many
of
us
well
you
not
going
to
live
here
said
laura
there
room
enough
for
just
patty
and
her
father
there
is
if
we
each
take
a
room
to
ourself
said
fairfield
you
may
have
this
parlour
my
daughter
and
i
take
the
library
where
is
the
library
miss
russell
i
think
it
has
just
stepped
out
said
frank
at
any
rate
it
is
on
this
floor
there
only
this
room
and
the
and
a
kitchen
cupboard
very
likely
the
library
is
on
the
third
floor
said
marian
that
would
be
convenient
there
is
any
third
floor
explained
laura
this
is
what
they
call
a
house
it
would
have
to
be
expanded
into
a
serial
story
then
before
it
would
do
for
us
said
fairfield
we
may
not
be
such
big
people
but
patty
and
i
have
a
pretty
large
estimate
of
ourselves
and
i
am
sure
we
never
could
live
in
such
a
as
this
seems
to
be
indeed
we
could
papa
said
patty
just
look
at
this
i
sure
it
only
big
enough
for
one
we
would
have
to
have
our
meals
alternately
you
could
have
breakfast
and
i
would
have
dinner
one
day
and
the
next
day
we
reverse
the
order
come
look
at
the
kitchen
patty
called
out
frank
or
at
least
stick
your
head
in
there
is
room
for
all
of
you
see
the
stationary
tubs
two
of
them
you
see
each
just
the
size
of
a
good
comfortable
just
exactly
said
patty
laughing
why
i
never
saw
such
a
house
laura
russell
what
were
you
thinking
of
oh
of
course
you
could
add
to
it
said
laura
you
could
build
on
as
many
more
rooms
as
you
wanted
and
you
could
run
it
up
another
story
and
a
half
and
that
would
make
three
stories
and
i
do
want
you
to
live
near
me
we
sorry
not
to
live
near
you
miss
laura
said
fairfield
but
i
ca
see
my
way
clear
to
do
it
unless
you
would
move
into
this
bandbox
and
let
us
have
your
roomy
and
comfortable
mansion
next
door
oh
there
would
be
room
for
our
family
here
said
laura
but
you
could
build
on
a
whole
lot
of
rooms
said
frank
and
add
enough
stories
to
make
it
a
and
put
in
an
elevator
and
it
would
be
perfectly
lovely
laura
laughed
with
the
rest
and
then
at
elliott
suggestion
they
all
started
back
to
the
bigelow
house
now
this
is
something
like
said
marian
as
they
went
in
at
the
gate
and
up
the
broad
front
walk
like
what
said
frank
like
a
home
for
the
fairfields
what
shall
you
call
it
fairfield
hall
fairfield
place
or
what
i
do
know
cried
patty
dashing
up
the
veranda
steps
but
is
it
a
dear
house
i
feel
at
home
here
already
this
big
piazza
will
be
lovely
in
warm
weather
there
room
for
hammocks
and
big
chairs
and
little
tables
and
everything
inside
the
house
proved
very
attractive
the
large
square
hall
opened
into
a
parlour
on
one
side
and
a
library
on
the
other
back
of
the
library
was
a
little
conservatory
and
beyond
that
a
large
light
with
an
open
fireplace
here
a
kitchen
worth
having
said
aunt
alice
who
was
investigating
ahead
of
the
rest
and
such
convenient
pantries
and
cupboards
and
this
back
veranda
is
great
said
frank
opening
the
door
from
a
little
hall
oh
yes
said
patty
see
the
dead
vines
in
the
summer
it
must
have
honeysuckles
all
over
it
and
there
the
little
arbour
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
i
going
down
to
see
it
marian
started
to
follow
her
but
laura
called
her
back
to
show
her
some
new
attraction
and
patty
ran
alone
down
the
veranda
steps
and
through
the
paths
to
the
little
rustic
arbour
goodness
she
exclaimed
as
she
reached
it
who
in
the
world
are
you
for
inside
the
arbour
sat
a
girl
of
about
patty
own
age
she
was
a
tall
thin
child
with
a
pale
face
large
black
eyes
and
straight
black
hair
which
hung
in
wisps
about
her
ears
i
pansy
she
said
clasping
her
hands
in
front
of
her
and
looking
straight
into
patty
face
you
pansy
are
you
said
patty
looking
puzzled
and
what
are
you
doing
here
pansy
well
miss
you
see
it
this
way
i
want
to
go
out
to
service
and
when
i
heard
you
was
going
to
have
a
house
of
your
own
i
thought
maybe
take
me
to
work
for
you
oh
you
did
well
why
did
you
come
and
apply
to
me
then
in
proper
fashion
and
not
sit
out
here
waiting
for
me
to
come
to
you
suppose
i
had
come
i
was
sure
you
come
miss
everybody
who
looks
at
this
house
comes
out
to
look
at
the
arbour
but
there
has
been
anybody
before
that
i
wanted
to
work
for
please
take
me
miss
i
be
faithful
and
true
what
can
you
do
asked
patty
half
laughing
and
half
pitying
the
girl
can
you
cook
no
i
ca
cook
but
i
might
learn
it
but
i
did
mean
that
i
thought
you
have
a
cook
and
you
take
me
for
a
table
girl
you
know
and
to
tidy
up
after
you
i
do
want
a
waitress
but
have
you
had
any
experience
no
said
the
girl
very
earnestly
i
have
but
i
just
sure
i
could
learn
if
you
just
tell
me
a
thing
once
you
need
ever
tell
it
to
me
again
that
something
is
it
indeed
it
is
said
patty
remembering
a
certain
careless
waitress
at
elliott
have
you
any
references
no
said
the
girl
smiling
you
see
i
never
lived
anywhere
except
home
and
i
suppose
mother
reference
would
count
it
would
with
me
said
patty
decidedly
i
think
your
mother
ought
to
know
more
about
you
than
anybody
else
what
would
she
say
if
i
asked
her
she
say
i
was
careless
and
heedless
and
thoughtless
and
did
know
anything
replied
the
girl
cheerfully
and
i
am
that
way
at
home
but
i
would
be
if
i
worked
for
you
because
i
want
to
be
a
waitress
and
a
good
one
and
you
see
how
quick
i
learn
oh
do
take
me
miss
never
be
sorry
and
that
sure
this
statement
was
accompanied
by
such
decided
gestures
of
head
and
hands
that
patty
was
very
nearly
convinced
to
the
contrary
but
she
only
said
i
sorry
pansy
you
said
your
name
was
pansy
did
you
yes
miss
pansy
potts
what
an
extraordinary
name
is
it
miss
well
you
see
my
father
name
was
potts
and
mother
named
me
pansy
because
she
so
fond
of
the
flower
you
do
think
the
name
will
interfere
with
my
being
a
waitress
do
you
not
so
far
as
i
concerned
said
patty
laughing
but
you
see
i
shall
be
a
very
inexperienced
housekeeper
and
if
i
have
an
inexperienced
waitress
also
i
do
know
what
might
happen
why
now
miss
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
work
out
just
right
you
a
young
housekeeper
but
i
expect
you
know
just
about
what
a
waitress
ought
to
do
and
you
could
teach
me
and
i
know
a
lot
about
housekeeping
and
i
could
teach
you
the
sincerity
in
pansy
voice
and
manner
impressed
patty
and
she
looked
at
her
closely
as
she
said
it
does
seem
good
proportion
it
is
said
pansy
and
you
no
idea
how
quickly
i
can
learn
can
you
said
patty
well
then
learn
first
to
call
me
miss
patty
it
would
suit
me
much
better
than
to
hear
you
say
so
often
yes
miss
patty
and
do
wring
your
hands
in
that
absurd
fashion
and
do
stand
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
as
if
you
were
scared
out
of
your
wits
no
miss
patty
pansy
ceased
shuffling
dropped
her
hands
naturally
to
her
sides
and
stood
in
the
quiet
respectful
attitude
that
patty
had
unconsciously
assumed
while
speaking
delighted
at
this
mimicry
patty
exclaimed
i
believe
you
will
do
i
believe
you
are
just
the
one
but
i
decide
positively
now
you
go
home
pansy
and
come
afternoon
to
see
me
at
elliott
do
you
know
where
i
live
yes
miss
patty
and
with
a
respectful
little
bob
of
her
head
pansy
potts
disappeared
and
patty
ran
back
to
the
house
well
chickadee
said
fairfield
i
have
about
decided
that
you
and
i
can
make
ourselves
comfortable
within
these
four
walls
and
if
it
suits
your
ladyship
i
think
we
consider
that
we
have
taken
the
house
it
does
suit
me
said
patty
i
perfectly
satisfied
and
have
taken
a
where
did
you
get
her
exclaimed
frank
do
they
grow
on
trees
in
the
garden
i
saw
you
out
in
the
arbour
with
one
yes
said
patty
i
picked
her
off
a
tree
she
is
quite
ripe
but
she
not
so
very
green
and
i
think
she
do
never
mind
about
her
now
i
ca
decide
until
i
had
a
talk
with
aunt
alice
i
so
glad
you
decided
on
this
house
papa
oh
is
it
lovely
to
have
a
home
it
looks
rather
bare
to
be
sure
but
be
it
ever
so
empty
there
no
place
like
home
now
what
shall
we
name
it
i
do
like
a
nice
name
for
a
place
it
has
so
many
of
those
little
boxwood
hedges
said
aunt
alice
looking
out
of
the
window
that
you
might
call
it
the
boxwood
house
oh
do
call
it
a
said
uncle
charley
call
it
the
and
be
done
with
it
frank
i
like
said
patty
how
is
boxwood
hall
sounds
like
locksley
hall
said
marian
more
like
boxley
hall
said
frank
boxley
hall
cried
patty
that
just
the
thing
i
like
that
rather
a
pretentious
name
to
live
up
to
said
fairfield
never
mind
said
patty
with
pansy
potts
for
a
waitress
we
can
live
up
to
any
name
and
so
patty
new
home
was
chosen
and
its
name
was
boxley
hall
chapter
v
shopping
as
boxley
hall
was
a
sort
of
experiment
fairfield
concluded
to
rent
the
place
for
a
year
with
the
privilege
of
buying
by
this
time
patty
was
sure
that
she
wished
to
remain
in
vernondale
all
her
life
but
her
father
said
that
women
even
very
young
ones
were
fickle
in
their
tastes
and
he
thought
it
wiser
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
it
does
matter
as
patty
said
to
marian
for
when
the
year
is
up
papa
will
just
buy
the
house
and
then
it
will
be
all
right
having
found
a
home
the
next
thing
was
to
furnish
it
and
about
this
fairfield
was
very
decided
and
methodical
he
said
as
they
were
talking
it
over
at
the
elliotts
one
evening
i
shall
take
patty
to
new
york
to
select
the
most
important
pieces
of
furniture
we
shall
go
alone
because
it
is
a
very
special
occasion
and
we
ca
allow
ourselves
to
be
hampered
by
outside
advices
another
day
we
shall
go
to
buy
prosaic
things
like
tablecloths
and
and
then
as
we
know
little
about
such
things
we
shall
be
glad
to
take
with
us
some
experienced
advisers
and
so
the
next
day
patty
and
her
father
started
for
the
city
to
buy
furniture
for
boxley
hall
you
see
patty
said
her
father
after
they
were
seated
in
the
train
there
is
a
certain
proportion
to
be
observed
in
furnishing
a
house
about
which
i
imagine
you
know
very
little
very
little
indeed
returned
patty
but
then
how
should
i
know
such
things
when
i
never
furnished
a
house
i
understand
that
said
fairfield
and
so
with
my
advantages
of
age
and
experience
and
your
own
natural
good
taste
i
think
we
shall
accomplish
this
thing
successfully
now
first
as
to
what
we
have
on
hand
why
we
have
anything
on
hand
said
patty
at
least
i
have
a
few
pictures
and
books
and
the
afghan
grandma
knitting
for
me
but
that
all
you
reckon
without
your
host
said
her
father
smiling
i
possess
some
few
objects
of
value
and
during
the
past
year
i
have
added
to
my
collection
in
anticipation
of
the
time
when
we
should
have
our
own
home
oh
papa
cried
patty
have
you
a
whole
lot
of
new
furniture
that
i
do
know
about
yes
said
fairfield
except
that
instead
of
being
new
it
is
mostly
old
i
had
opportunities
in
the
south
to
pick
up
bits
of
fine
old
mahogany
and
i
have
a
number
of
really
good
pieces
that
will
help
to
make
boxley
hall
attractive
what
are
they
papa
tell
me
all
about
them
i
ca
wait
another
minute
to
begin
with
child
i
have
several
heirlooms
the
old
sideboard
that
was
your
grandfather
fairfield
and
several
old
bureaus
and
tables
that
came
from
the
fairfield
estate
then
i
have
also
two
or
three
beautiful
and
an
old
desk
for
our
library
and
we
will
hunt
up
some
sort
of
a
big
roomy
table
that
will
do
to
go
with
them
let
make
the
library
the
nicest
room
in
the
house
papa
it
will
make
itself
that
if
you
give
it
half
a
chance
though
we
do
all
we
can
to
help
but
i
so
prosaic
i
would
like
to
have
special
attention
paid
to
the
comforts
of
the
and
as
to
your
own
bedroom
patty
i
want
you
to
see
to
it
that
it
fulfills
exactly
your
ideal
of
what
a
girl
room
ought
to
be
oh
i
know
just
how
i
want
that
almost
exactly
like
my
room
at
aunt
alice
but
with
a
few
more
of
the
sort
of
things
i
had
in
my
room
at
aunt
isabel
i
do
like
pretty
things
papa
that
right
my
child
i
glad
you
do
and
i
think
your
idea
of
pretty
things
is
not
merely
a
taste
for
highfalutin
gimcracks
no
i
do
think
it
is
said
patty
slowly
but
all
the
same
better
keep
pretty
close
to
me
when
i
pick
out
the
traps
for
my
room
do
you
know
papa
i
think
aunt
isabel
wants
to
help
us
furnish
our
house
she
wrote
that
she
would
meet
us
in
new
york
some
time
that
kind
of
her
said
fairfield
but
do
know
it
just
seems
to
me
that
we
be
able
to
manage
it
by
ourselves
our
house
is
not
of
the
era
of
queen
isabella
but
of
the
princess
patricia
that
sounds
like
aunt
isabel
they
always
called
me
patricia
there
do
you
think
papa
now
that
i
getting
so
grown
up
i
ought
to
be
called
patricia
patty
is
such
a
baby
name
patty
is
good
enough
for
me
said
fairfield
if
you
want
to
be
called
patricia
you
must
get
somebody
else
to
do
it
i
dare
say
you
could
hire
somebody
for
a
small
sum
per
week
to
call
you
patricia
for
a
given
number
of
times
every
day
now
you
making
fun
of
me
papa
but
i
do
want
to
grow
up
dignified
and
not
be
a
silly
schoolgirl
all
my
life
take
care
of
your
common
sense
and
your
dignity
will
take
care
of
itself
after
they
crossed
the
ferry
and
reached
the
new
york
side
fairfield
took
a
cab
and
they
made
a
round
of
the
various
shops
buying
such
beautiful
things
that
patty
grew
fairly
ecstatic
with
delight
i
do
think
you
wonderful
papa
she
exclaimed
after
they
had
selected
the
furnishings
you
know
exactly
what
you
want
and
when
you
describe
it
it
seems
to
be
the
only
possible
thing
that
anybody
could
want
for
that
particular
place
that
is
a
result
of
decision
of
character
my
child
it
is
a
fairfield
trait
and
i
hope
you
possess
it
though
i
can
not
say
i
have
seen
any
marked
development
of
it
as
yet
but
you
must
have
noticed
it
in
your
aunt
alice
yes
i
have
said
patty
she
is
so
decided
that
with
all
her
sweetness
i
have
sometimes
been
tempted
to
call
her
stubborn
stubbornness
and
decision
of
character
are
very
closely
allied
but
now
we
going
to
select
the
furniture
for
your
own
bedroom
and
if
you
have
any
decision
of
character
you
will
have
ample
opportunity
to
exercise
it
oh
i
have
plenty
of
decision
of
character
when
it
comes
to
that
said
patty
you
will
find
me
a
true
fairfield
aided
by
her
father
judgment
and
advice
patty
selected
the
furnishings
for
her
own
room
she
had
chosen
green
as
the
predominant
colour
and
the
couch
and
were
upholstered
in
a
lovely
design
of
green
and
white
the
rug
was
green
and
white
and
for
the
brass
bedstead
with
its
white
fittings
a
down
comfortable
with
a
pale
green
cover
was
found
the
dainty
was
of
maple
and
for
this
fairfield
ordered
a
bewildering
array
of
fittings
all
in
ivory
with
monogram
on
them
and
i
want
a
little
papa
she
said
a
little
one
you
know
just
for
my
favouritest
books
for
of
course
the
most
of
my
books
will
be
down
in
the
library
so
a
dear
little
was
bought
also
of
maple
and
a
pretty
little
with
a
low
chair
to
match
that
very
nice
said
patty
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
for
though
i
hate
to
sew
yet
sometimes
it
must
be
done
and
with
that
little
i
think
i
could
sew
even
in
an
indian
wigwam
patty
had
much
to
say
regarding
the
furniture
of
her
bedroom
for
fairfield
attended
to
that
himself
and
selected
the
things
with
such
rapidity
and
certainty
that
it
was
all
done
almost
before
patty
knew
it
now
said
fairfield
there
are
two
to
be
furnished
the
one
you
call
marian
room
and
the
other
for
the
general
stranger
within
our
gates
marian
room
was
done
up
in
blue
as
she
had
requested
and
the
other
was
furnished
in
yellow
it
was
great
fun
to
pick
out
the
furniture
rugs
and
curtains
for
these
rooms
and
patty
tried
very
hard
to
select
such
things
as
her
father
would
approve
of
for
she
dearly
loved
to
have
him
commend
her
taste
and
judgment
as
they
were
sitting
at
luncheon
fairfield
said
this
afternoon
i
think
we
will
devote
to
pictures
i
not
sure
we
will
buy
any
but
we
will
look
at
them
and
i
will
learn
what
is
your
taste
in
art
and
you
will
leant
what
is
mine
i
have
any
said
patty
cheerfully
i
do
know
anything
about
art
and
never
did
you
still
have
some
time
i
hope
in
which
to
learn
i
time
enough
but
i
do
believe
i
could
learn
the
only
pictures
i
like
are
pretty
ones
you
hopeless
and
that
a
fact
said
fairfield
of
all
discouraging
people
the
worst
are
those
who
like
pretty
pictures
but
i
sure
i
can
learn
said
patty
if
you
will
teach
me
you
are
more
flattering
than
convincing
said
fairfield
but
i
will
try
and
so
after
luncheon
they
visited
several
picture
shops
and
fairfield
imported
to
his
daughter
what
was
at
least
a
foundation
for
an
education
in
art
back
in
vernondale
patty
confided
to
marian
that
she
had
had
a
perfectly
lovely
time
all
the
morning
but
the
afternoon
was
so
much
fun
in
fact
she
said
it
was
very
much
like
that
little
book
we
had
to
study
in
school
called
to
judge
a
picture
the
following
saturday
another
shopping
tour
was
undertaken
this
time
aunt
alice
and
marian
accompanied
the
fairfields
and
there
was
more
fun
and
less
responsibility
for
patty
her
father
insisted
upon
her
undivided
attention
while
elliott
selected
towels
and
other
household
fittings
but
as
these
things
were
chosen
with
fairfield
promptness
and
decision
patty
had
nothing
to
do
but
admire
and
acquiesce
and
now
she
remarked
after
they
had
chosen
two
sets
of
china
and
a
quantity
of
glass
for
the
now
if
you
please
we
will
buy
me
some
to
entertain
the
tea
club
we
will
indeed
said
fairfield
and
both
he
and
aunt
alice
entered
into
the
selection
of
the
fittings
with
as
much
zest
as
they
had
shown
in
the
other
china
dainty
dresden
cups
were
found
lovely
plates
and
a
and
which
made
marian
and
patty
fairly
shriek
with
delight
a
wicker
was
found
to
hold
these
treasures
and
fairfield
added
the
most
fascinating
little
silver
and
and
strainer
oh
exclaimed
marian
made
quite
breathless
by
the
glory
of
it
all
the
tea
club
will
never
want
to
meet
anywhere
except
at
your
house
patty
they
have
to
said
patty
i
do
propose
to
have
them
every
time
well
you
have
to
have
them
every
other
time
anyway
said
marian
after
the
fun
of
picking
out
the
it
was
hard
to
come
down
to
the
plainer
claims
of
the
kitchen
but
aunt
alice
grew
so
interested
in
the
selection
of
granite
saucepans
and
patent
that
patty
too
became
enthusiastic
and
we
must
get
a
she
cried
for
i
shall
make
pumpkin
pies
every
day
oh
and
i
want
a
and
a
colander
and
a
and
a
and
a
why
patty
child
exclaimed
her
father
what
are
all
those
things
for
are
you
going
to
have
a
french
no
papa
but
i
expect
to
do
a
great
deal
of
fancy
cooking
myself
oh
you
do
well
then
buy
all
the
contraptions
that
are
necessary
but
do
omit
the
plain
gridirons
and
then
aunt
alice
and
patty
put
their
heads
together
in
a
most
sensible
fashion
and
ordered
a
kitchen
outfit
that
would
have
delighted
the
heart
of
any
housekeeper
not
only
kitchen
utensils
but
laundry
fittings
and
household
furnishings
generally
including
patent
devices
and
newly
invented
contrivances
which
were
supposed
to
be
of
great
aid
to
any
housewife
if
i
can
only
live
up
to
it
all
sighed
patty
as
she
looked
at
the
enormous
collection
of
iron
tin
wood
and
granite
or
down
to
it
said
marian
chapter
vi
servants
i
did
think
said
patty
in
a
disgusted
tone
that
we
could
get
settled
in
the
house
in
time
to
eat
our
christmas
dinner
there
but
it
does
look
a
bit
like
it
i
was
over
there
this
afternoon
and
such
a
mess
of
papering
and
painting
and
plumbing
i
never
saw
in
my
life
i
do
believe
it
will
be
done
i
do
either
said
marian
those
men
work
as
slow
as
the
conversation
was
taking
place
at
the
elliotts
and
uncle
charley
looked
up
from
his
carving
to
say
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
and
the
slower
the
are
the
longer
we
shall
have
our
guests
with
us
for
my
part
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
see
pretty
patty
go
out
of
this
house
patty
smiled
gaily
at
her
uncle
for
they
were
great
friends
and
said
then
i
shall
expect
you
to
visit
me
very
often
in
my
new
home
that
is
if
i
ever
get
there
i
ca
see
our
way
clear
to
a
christmas
dinner
in
boxley
hall
said
fairfield
but
i
think
i
can
promise
you
chick
that
you
can
invite
your
revered
uncle
and
his
family
to
dine
with
you
there
on
new
year
day
there
were
general
exclamations
of
delight
at
this
from
all
except
patty
who
looked
a
little
bewildered
what
the
matter
patsie
said
her
uncle
do
you
want
to
entertain
your
admiring
relatives
yes
said
patty
of
course
i
do
but
it
scares
me
to
death
to
think
of
it
how
can
i
have
a
dinner
party
when
i
do
know
anything
about
anything
aunt
alice
will
tell
you
something
about
something
said
her
father
and
i
tell
you
the
rest
about
the
rest
oh
i
know
it
will
be
all
right
said
patty
quickly
regaining
confidence
as
she
looked
at
her
father
if
papa
says
the
house
will
be
ready
i
know
it
will
be
and
if
he
says
we
have
a
dinner
party
on
new
year
day
i
know
we
will
and
so
i
now
invite
you
all
and
i
expect
you
all
to
accept
and
i
hope
aunt
alice
will
come
early
i
shall
come
the
night
before
said
marian
so
as
to
be
sure
to
be
there
in
time
i
not
sure
that
any
of
us
will
be
there
the
night
before
said
fairfield
laughing
i
guaranteed
the
house
for
the
dinner
but
i
did
say
we
would
be
living
there
at
the
time
that
a
good
idea
said
aunt
alice
let
patty
entertain
her
first
company
there
and
then
come
back
here
for
the
reaction
well
we
see
said
patty
but
i
like
to
go
there
the
first
day
of
january
and
stay
there
by
some
unknown
methods
fairfield
managed
to
stir
up
the
workmen
to
greater
activity
and
the
work
went
rapidly
on
the
seemed
to
get
themselves
into
place
and
the
floors
took
on
a
beautiful
polish
bustling
men
came
out
from
the
city
and
put
up
and
curtains
and
draperies
and
under
supervision
laid
rugs
and
hung
pictures
the
ladies
of
the
elliott
household
organised
themselves
into
a
most
active
grandma
aunt
alice
marian
and
patty
hemmed
tablecloths
and
napkins
with
great
diligence
and
even
little
edith
was
allowed
to
help
with
the
kitchen
towels
everybody
was
so
kind
that
patty
began
to
feel
weighed
down
with
gratitude
the
girls
of
the
tea
club
made
the
that
they
had
proposed
and
they
also
brought
offerings
of
and
doilies
and
until
patty
room
began
to
look
like
a
booth
at
a
fancy
bazaar
one
saturday
morning
as
the
was
hard
at
work
little
gilbert
came
in
carrying
a
paper
bag
which
evidently
contained
something
valuable
it
for
you
patty
he
said
i
brought
it
for
you
to
help
keep
house
and
its
name
is
pudgy
depositing
the
bag
in
his
cousin
lap
little
gilbert
knelt
beside
her
you
need
open
it
he
cried
it
will
open
itself
and
sure
enough
the
mouth
of
the
bag
untwisted
and
a
little
grey
head
came
poking
out
a
kitten
exclaimed
patty
a
maltese
kitten
why
that
just
the
very
thing
i
wanted
where
did
you
get
it
gilbert
dear
from
the
milkman
said
gilbert
proudly
we
always
get
kitties
from
him
and
i
telled
him
to
pick
out
a
nice
pretty
one
for
you
do
you
like
it
i
love
it
said
patty
cuddling
the
little
bunch
of
grey
fur
and
pudgy
is
just
the
right
name
for
it
it
the
fattest
little
cat
i
ever
saw
yes
said
gilbert
gravely
do
let
it
get
thin
will
you
no
indeed
said
patty
i
feed
it
on
strawberries
and
cream
all
the
year
round
that
same
afternoon
patty
and
aunt
alice
started
out
on
a
expedition
a
cook
tour
frank
called
it
and
the
tourists
took
it
very
seriously
much
of
the
success
of
your
home
patty
said
aunt
alice
as
they
were
going
to
the
intelligence
office
depends
upon
your
cook
for
she
will
be
not
only
a
cook
but
in
part
housekeeper
and
overseer
of
the
whole
place
and
while
you
must
of
course
exercise
your
authority
and
demand
respect
yet
at
the
same
time
you
will
find
it
necessary
to
defer
to
her
judgment
and
experience
on
many
occasions
i
know
it
aunt
alice
said
patty
very
earnestly
and
i
do
want
to
do
what
is
right
i
want
to
be
the
head
of
papa
home
and
yet
there
are
a
great
many
things
that
my
servants
will
know
more
about
than
i
do
i
shall
have
to
be
very
careful
about
my
proportion
but
if
you
and
papa
will
help
me
i
think
i
come
out
all
right
i
think
you
will
said
aunt
alice
but
she
smiled
a
little
at
the
assured
toss
of
her
niece
head
the
intelligence
office
proved
to
be
as
much
misnamed
as
those
institutions
usually
are
and
varying
degrees
of
unintelligence
were
shown
in
the
candidates
offered
for
the
position
of
cook
at
boxley
hall
though
if
the
applicants
seemed
unsatisfactory
to
patty
in
many
cases
she
was
no
less
so
to
them
one
tall
rawboned
irishwoman
seemed
hopefully
and
capable
but
when
she
discovered
that
patty
was
to
be
her
mistress
instead
of
elliott
as
she
had
supposed
she
exclaimed
go
wid
yez
wud
i
be
workin
for
the
likes
of
a
child
like
that
no
mum
i
ai
no
nurse
i
a
cook
and
i
want
a
mistress
as
has
got
past
playing
wid
dolls
i
hope
you
find
one
said
patty
politely
and
i
afraid
we
would
suit
each
other
another
irish
girl
with
a
merry
rosy
face
and
frizzled
blonde
hair
was
very
anxious
to
go
to
work
for
patty
sure
it
will
be
fun
she
said
i
like
to
work
for
such
a
pretty
little
lady
and
sure
we
have
the
good
times
could
i
have
all
me
afternoons
out
miss
not
if
you
lived
with
me
said
patty
laughing
my
house
is
large
and
there
a
great
deal
of
work
to
be
done
by
somebody
i
think
my
cook
could
do
her
share
if
she
went
out
every
afternoon
many
others
were
interviewed
but
each
seemed
to
have
more
or
less
objectionable
traits
one
would
not
come
unless
she
were
the
only
servant
another
would
not
come
unless
patty
kept
five
most
of
them
showed
such
a
decided
lack
of
respect
to
so
young
a
mistress
that
aunt
alice
began
to
despair
of
finding
the
kind
capable
woman
she
had
imagined
they
went
home
feeling
rather
discouraged
but
when
patty
told
her
troubles
to
her
father
he
only
laughed
bless
your
heart
child
he
said
you
could
expect
to
engage
a
whole
cook
in
one
afternoon
it
a
long
and
serious
process
but
papa
you
said
we
be
all
settled
and
ready
by
the
first
of
january
yes
i
know
but
i
did
say
which
january
now
you
teasing
said
patty
but
she
ran
away
with
a
light
heart
feeling
sure
that
somehow
a
cook
would
be
provided
that
evening
according
to
appointment
pansy
potts
appeared
for
inspection
the
whole
elliott
family
was
present
and
observed
with
much
interest
the
girl
but
though
ignorant
and
awkward
pansy
was
not
embarrassed
and
seeming
to
realise
that
her
fate
lay
in
the
hands
of
elliott
fairfield
and
patty
she
addressed
herself
to
them
her
manner
though
untrained
showed
respectful
deference
and
her
expressive
black
eyes
showed
quick
perception
and
clever
adaptability
she
is
all
right
at
heart
thought
fairfield
to
himself
but
she
knows
next
to
nothing
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
let
the
two
girls
help
each
other
out
have
you
ever
waited
at
table
pansy
he
asked
so
pleasantly
that
pansy
potts
felt
encouragement
rather
than
alarm
no
sir
but
i
could
learn
and
i
would
do
exactly
as
i
was
told
that
the
right
spirit
said
fairfield
i
think
perhaps
have
to
give
you
a
trial
but
do
you
know
anything
of
a
housemaid
duties
inquired
aunt
alice
who
was
a
little
dubious
in
the
face
of
such
absolute
ignorance
for
instance
if
the
should
ring
what
would
you
do
i
would
have
asked
miss
patty
beforehand
and
i
would
do
whatever
she
had
told
me
to
good
enough
exclaimed
fairfield
i
think
you
do
pansy
at
any
rate
you
have
nothing
to
unlearn
and
that
a
great
deal
so
the
waitress
was
engaged
and
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
a
cook
dropped
from
the
skies
as
patty
expressed
it
one
afternoon
a
large
and
coloured
woman
appeared
at
elliott
house
with
a
note
from
stevens
recommending
her
as
a
cook
for
patty
as
soon
as
patty
saw
her
she
liked
her
but
remembering
previous
experiences
she
said
do
you
understand
that
you
are
to
work
for
me
i
a
very
young
housekeeper

missy
dat

said
aunt
alice
a
young
girl
who

a
waitress
she

ignorant
and
inexperienced
but
very
willing
to
learn
do

said
patty
but
i
hope
to

to
live
on
new
year
day
i
think
we
be
glad
of
mancy
help
a
few
days
before
that
said
aunt
alice
and
so
subject
to
fairfield
final
sanction
mancy
was
engaged
and
now
patty
whole
establishment
including
pudgy
the
cat
was
made
up
chapter
vii
differing
tastes
a
few
days
before
the
close
of
the
old
year
patty
sat
at
her
desk
in
the
library
of
boxley
hall
she
was
making
lists
of
good
things
to
be
ordered
for
the
feast
on
new
year
day
and
as
it
was
her
first
unaided
experience
with
such
memoranda
she
wore
an
air
of
great
importance
and
a
deeply
puckered
brow
mancy
with
her
arms
comfortably
akimbo
stood
before
her
young
mistress
ready
to
suggest
but
tactfully
chary
of
advice
they
were
not
yet
living
in
the
new
home
but
all
the
furniture
was
in
place
the
furnace
fire
had
been
started
and
the
palms
arranged
in
the
little
conservatory
so
patty
spent
most
of
her
time
there
and
some
of
the
elliotts
were
usually
there
with
her
but
this
morning
she
was
alone
with
mancy
struggling
with
the
lists
i
make
the
salad
myself
she
remarked
as
she
wrote
olive
oil
on
her
slip
of
paper
yas
answered
mancy
rolling
her
eyes
with
an
expression
of
dubious
approval
does
yo
know
how
missy
oh
yes
said
patty
confidently
i
can
make
most
beautiful
salad
dressing
only
it
does
take
quite
a
long
time
and
i
shall
have
a
lot
to
do
thursday
morning
perhaps
i
better
leave
it
to
you
this
time
mancy
can
you
make
it
laws
yes
honey
and
yo
better
leave
it
to
me
yo
have
enough
to
do
with
yo
flowers
and
fixin
and
dressin
yourself
up
pretty
to
the
food
well
all
right
mancy
i
wish
you
would
and
now
just
help
me
with
this
list
i
read
it
to
you
and
see
if
you
think
of
anything
that
i
forgotten
yas
said
mancy
who
was
most
anxious
to
help
but
who
had
already
learned
that
patty
was
a
little
inclined
to
resent
unasked
advice
they
were
deep
in
the
fascinating
bewilderments
of
grocers
and
greengrocers
wares
when
pansy
potts
appeared
in
the
doorway
miss
patty
she
said
i
done
all
the
things
you
told
me
to
do
and
i
watered
the
palms
and
i
poked
around
that
bunchy
rosebush
but
sure
it
going
to
die
and
now
if
you
please
when
can
i
be
let
to
fix
up
my
own
room
sure
enough
pansy
said
patty
we
must
get
at
that
room
of
yours
and
we
fix
it
up
as
pretty
as
we
can
mine
too
said
mancy
i
wants
my
room
fixed
up
nice
i
fetched
a
lot
of
pictures
to
liven
it
up
some
but
i
reckon
i
ai
got
no
time
to
put
up
oh
yes
you
have
mancy
said
patty
rising
and
anyway
we
go
right
up
and
look
at
those
rooms
then
i
can
tell
what
we
need
to
get
for
them
mine
wo
need
anything
said
pansy
except
what
in
it
already
and
what
i
got
to
put
in
it
myself
i
brought
my
decorations
over
this
morning
oh
you
did
said
patty
well
bring
them
along
and
we
all
go
upstairs
together
i
get
mine
too
said
mancy
shuffling
toward
the
kitchen
the
servants
rooms
were
in
the
third
story
they
had
been
freshly
papered
and
neatly
and
appropriately
furnished
though
patty
had
not
as
yet
added
any
pictures
or
ornaments
and
apparently
she
would
have
no
occasion
to
do
so
for
as
she
went
up
to
these
rooms
she
was
immediately
followed
by
their
future
occupants
each
of
whom
came
with
her
arms
full
of
what
looked
like
the
most
worthless
rubbish
what
all
that
stuff
pansy
exclaimed
patty
as
she
beheld
her
young
waitress
fairly
staggering
under
her
load
they
lovely
things
miss
patty
and
i
hope
you
do
mind
this
is
a
hornet
nest
and
this
is
a
branch
of
an
apple
tree
with
a
nest
on
it
a
branch
it
a
big
limb
a
bough
i
should
call
it
what
you
going
to
do
with
it
i
thought
i
put
it
on
the
wall
miss
patty
it
makes
the
room
look
outdoorsy
it
does
indeed
put
it
up
if
you
like
but
will
you
have
room
then
to
get
in
yourself
oh
yes
said
pansy
cheerfully
and
i
got
a
big
tub
over
home
that
i
want
to
bring
it
has
an
orange
tree
planted
in
it
with
oranges
on
oh
no
not
oranges
indeed
it
has
any
leaves
on
but
i
think
maybe
they
come
it
must
be
beautiful
said
patty
but
if
it
has
any
leaves
on
probably
dead
oh
no
miss
patty
it
is
dead
and
it
had
leaves
but
my
little
brother
he
picked
the
leaves
all
off
that
one
reason
i
wanted
to
come
here
so
to
get
my
orange
tree
away
from
jack
well
bring
it
along
said
patty
what
else
are
you
going
to
have
a
i
suppose
trained
over
the
headboard
of
your
bed
no
miss
patty
i
have
got
no
grapevine
but
i
got
a
in
a
pot
that
i
want
to
set

the
mantel
all
right
said
patty
bring
your
and
let
him
wander
wherever
he
likes
you
have
to
keep
your
door
shut
or
he
wander
out
and
run
downstairs
what
in
that
bag
rocks

patty
rocks

in
the
world

to

the
window

beautiful
miss

if

years

beautiful
stones
pansy
potts
was
on
her
knees
arranging
the
stones
many
of
which
were
jagged
pieces
of
quartz
shining
here
and
there
with
mica
scales
into
a
symmetrical
pile
which
somehow
had
the
effect
of
a
pagan
altar
well
said
patty
as
she
watched
her
i
do
think
you
need
any
of
the
decorations
i
expected

glad
to

so
how
are
progressing
mancy
patty
stepped
across
the
hall
to
her
cook
room
and
found
its
stout
occupant
rather
precariously
perched
on
a
chair
tacking
up
a
picture
she
had
evidently
improved
her
time
for
many
other
pictures
were
already
in
place
and
what
is
unusual
in
either
a
public
or
private
the
pictures
were
all
exactly
alike
they
were
large
very
highly
coloured
unframed
and
in
fact
were
nothing
more
or
less
than
advertisements
of
a
popular
soap
the
subject
was
a
old
coloured
woman
washing
clothes
that
were
already
in
a
sea
of
soapsuds
for
goodness
sake
mancy
exclaimed
patty
who
said
you
might
drive
tacks
all
over
these
new
walls
and
where
did
you
get
all
those
pictures
of
yourself
they
does
favour
me
do
they
missy
exclaimed
mancy
beaming
with
delight
as
she
took
another
tack
from
her
mouth
and
pounded
it
into
place

de
grocer

des
nachelly

tired
of

at
different
pitchers
it
my
head
i
should
think
these
would
distract
your
head
i
feel
as
if
i
were
in
a
kinetoscope
does
that
mean
not
exactly
but
tell
me
mancy
did
you

all

because
they

little
about

places

said
as
she
jumped
down
from

chair
for
the
last
time

have
just
exactly
what
you
want
and
nothing
else
now
let
go
and
see
how
pansy
getting
along
the
rockery
was
completed
and
was
a
most
imposing
structure
wheat
ears
and
dried
oats
were
sticking
out
from
between
the
stones
and
pressed
autumn
leaves
added
a
touch
of
colour
at
the
base
of
the
rockery
were
a
large
and
several
smaller
shells
on
the
walls
were
various
branches
of
different
species
of
vegetation
among
others
a
tangle
of
twigs
of
the
cotton
plant
from
which
depended
numerous
bolls
pansy
was
struggling
with
a
lot
of
evergreen
boughs
which
she
was
trying
to
crowd
into
a
receptacle
how
do
you
like
it
miss
patty
she
asked
as
patty
stood
in
the
doorway
and
gazed
in
i
like
it
very
much
for
you
pansy
replied
patty
if
this
is
the
kind
of
room
you
want
i
very
glad
for
you
to
have
it
only
i
know
whether
to
call
it
course
in
mineralogy
or
to
tell
the
wild
flowers
chapter
viii
an
unattained
ambition
to
say
that
boxley
hall
was
in
readiness
for
the
party
would
be
stating
it
very
mildly
it
was
overflowing
yes
fairly
bursting
with
readiness
new
year
day
was
on
thursday
and
patty
had
decreed
that
on
that
day
none
of
the
elliotts
should
go
to
boxley
hall
until
they
came
as
guests
dinner
was
to
be
at
two
and
in
the
morning
patty
and
her
father
went
over
to
their
new
home
together
just
think
papa
said
patty
squeezing
his
hand
as
they
went
along
how
many
times
we
have
walked
and
run
too
for
that
matter
from
aunt
alice
over
to
our
house
but
this
time
it
different
we
going
to
stay
to
live
really
to
in
our
own
home
and
whenever
we
go
to
aunt
alice
again
it
will
be
to
visit
or
to
call
oh
is
it
perfectly
lovely
if
i
can
only
live
up
to
it
and
do
things
just
as
you
want
me
to
do
take
it
too
seriously
pattikins
i
do
expect
you
to
become
an
old
and
experienced
housewife
all
at
once
and
i
do
want
you
to
wear
yourself
out
trying
to
become
such
a
personage
indeed
i
shall
be
terribly
disappointed
if
you
do
make
ridiculous
mistakes
and
give
me
some
opportunity
to
laugh
at
you
you
are
the
dearest
thing
papa
that
just
the
way
i
want
you
to
feel
about
it
and
i
think
i
can
safely
promise
to
make
enough
blunders
to
keep
you
giggling
a
good
portion
of
the
time
oh
do
go
out
of
your
way
to
furnish
me
with
amusement
and
now
how
about
your
party
is
everything
in
order
yes
except
a
few
thousand
things
that
i
have
to
do
this
morning
and
a
few
hundred
that
i
want
you
to
do
i
shall
see
to
it
first
that
the
is
well
sharpened
the
first
time
that
i
have
carved
at
my
own
table
for
a
great
many
years
and
i
want
the
performance
to
be
marked
by
grace
and
skill
it
will
be
if
you
do
it
papa
i
sure
of
that
and
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
gate
and
patty
was
skipping
along
the
path
and
up
the
steps
and
into
the
door
of
her
own
home
mancy
and
pansy
potts
were
already
there
and
to
a
casual
observer
it
looked
as
if
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
except
to
admit
the
guests
patty
had
set
the
table
the
day
before
and
to
the
awestruck
admiration
of
pansy
potts
had
arranged
the
beautiful
new
glass
and
china
with
most
satisfactory
effects
pansy
had
watched
the
proceedings
with
intelligent
scrutiny
and
when
it
was
finished
had
told
patty
that
the
next
time
she
would
be
able
to
do
it
herself
you
have
a
chance
to
try
patty
had
answered
for
in
the
evening
we
have
supper
and
you
may
set
the
table
all
by
yourself
and
come
out
and
look
it
over
to
make
sure
it
all
right
but
as
patty
had
said
there
was
yet
much
to
be
done
on
thursday
morning
even
though
there
were
eight
hands
to
make
the
work
light
boxes
of
flowers
had
arrived
from
the
florist
and
these
had
to
be
arranged
in
the
various
rooms
also
a
few
potted
plants
in
full
bloom
had
come
for
the
conservatory
and
these
so
delighted
the
soul
of
pansy
potts
that
patty
feared
the
girl
would
spend
the
whole
day
nursing
them
come
pansy
she
called
let
them
grow
by
themselves
for
a
while
i
want
your
help
in
the
kitchen
but
oh
miss
patty
they
daisies
real
white
daisies
with
yellow
centres
well
they
still
be
daisies
and
you
have
more
time
to
admire
them
then
patty
ambitions
in
the
culinary
line
ran
to
the
fanciful
and
elaborate
confections
which
were
pictured
in
the
and
in
the
household
periodicals
especially
did
she
incline
toward
marvellous
desserts
which
called
for
spun
sugar
and
syllabubs
and
rare
sweetmeats
and
patent
freezing
processes
for
her
new
year
dinner
party
she
had
decided
to
try
the
most
complicated
recipe
of
all
and
moreover
intended
to
surprise
everybody
with
it
warning
her
father
to
keep
out
of
the
kitchen
on
pain
of
excommunication
she
rolled
up
her
sleeves
and
tied
on
a
white
apron
and
with
her
open
book
on
the
table
before
her
began
her
proceedings
pansy
potts
was
set
to
whipping
cream
with
a
and
mancy
was
requested
to
blanch
some
almonds
and
pound
them
to
a
paste
in
a
very
new
and
very
large
mortar
though
the
mancy
was
more
than
willing
to
help
her
young
mistress
through
what
threatened
to
be
somewhat
troubled
waters
yet
she
had
the
more
substantial
portions
of
the
dinner
to
prepare
and
there
was
none
too
much
time
as
patty
went
on
with
her
work
difficulties
of
all
sorts
presented
themselves
the
cream
would
whip
but
remained
exasperatingly
fluid
the
sugar
refused
to
spin
a
thread
and
obstinately
crystallised
itself
into
a
hard
crust
the
almonds
persisted
in
becoming
a
lumpy
mass
instead
of
a
smooth
paste
and
the
gelatine
as
patty
despairingly
remarked
acted
like
all
possessed
but
having
attempted
the
thing
she
was
bound
to
carry
it
through
though
it
was
with
some
misgivings
that
she
finally
poured
a
queer
and
substance
into
the
patent
freezer
pansy
potts
had
declared
herself
quite
able
to
accomplish
the
freezing
process
but
as
she
was
about
to
begin
she
announced
in
tragic
tones
that
the
extra
ice
had
come
oh
exclaimed
patty
in
desperation
everything
seems
to
go
wrong
about
that
dessert
well
pansy
you
use
what
ice
there
is
and
telephone
for
some
more
right
away
but
when
patty
called
up
the
ice
company
she
found
that
their
office
was
closed
for
the
day
and
hanging
up
the
receiver
with
an
angry
little
jerk
she
turned
to
find
her
father
smiling
at
her
i
see
you
have
begun
to
amuse
me
he
said
but
never
mind
about
my
entertainment
now
puss
run
away
and
get
dressed
or
you
wo
be
ready
to
receive
your
guests
it
one
now
oh
papa
is
it
so
late
and
i
have
to
get
into
that
new
frock
well
scuttle
along
then
and
make
all
the
haste
you
can
patty
scuttled
but
during
the
process
of
making
all
the
haste
she
could
she
very
nearly
lost
her
temper
the
new
white
frock
was
complicated
the
broad
white
were
difficult
to
tie
and
as
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
made
a
toilette
in
her
new
home
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
many
useful
or
indispensable
little
articles
were
missing
pansy
she
called
as
she
heard
the
girl
in
the
do
for
mercy
sake
come
up
and
help
me
i
ca
find
my
and
i
ca
button
the
yoke
of
this
crazy
dress
without
it
pansy
came
to
the
rescue
and
just
as
the
elliott
family
came
in
at
the
front
gate
patty
completely
attired
but
very
flushed
and
breathless
from
her
rapid
exertions
flew
downstairs
and
tucked
her
arm
through
her
father
as
he
stood
in
the
hall
i
here
she
said
demurely
and
trying
to
speak
calmly
oh
so
you
are
he
said
i
thought
a
white
cashmere
whirlwind
had
struck
me
i
you
did
hurry
yourself
oh
no
said
patty
meeting
his
merry
smile
with
another
i
just
dawdled
through
my
dressing
to
kill
time
yes
you
look
so
said
her
father
and
just
then
the
doorbell
rang
oh
papa
cried
patty
her
eyes
dancing
with
excitement
it
just
grand
that
the
first
ring
at
our
own
doorbell
our
doorbell
you
know
and
has
it
a
musical
ring
and
now
it
will
be
answered
by
our
own
pansy
without
a
trace
of
the
hurry
and
fluster
that
had
so
affected
her
young
mistress
pansy
potts
in
neat
white
cap
and
apron
opened
the
door
to
the
guests
patty
nudged
her
father
arm
in
glee
as
they
noted
the
correct
demeanour
of
their
own
waitress
and
then
all
such
considerations
were
drowned
in
the
outburst
of
enthusiasm
that
accompanied
the
entrance
of
the
elliotts
the
younger
members
of
the
family
announced
themselves
with
wild
of
delight
and
the
older
ones
though
less
noisy
were
no
less
enthusiastic
i
like
cousin
patty
house
announced
gilbert
sitting
down
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
i
will
stay
here
always
where
is
the
pudgy
i
get
her
for
you
right
away
said
patty
she
is
fatter
than
ever
but
first
let
me
make
grandma
comfortable
taking
elliott
bonnet
and
wraps
patty
led
the
old
lady
to
a
large
and
announced
that
she
must
sit
there
for
a
few
moments
and
rest
before
she
made
a
tour
of
inspection
around
the
house
grandma
elliott
had
not
been
allowed
in
the
new
house
while
it
was
being
arranged
lest
she
should
take
cold
and
so
it
burst
upon
her
in
all
its
glory
by
this
time
frank
and
marian
were
investigating
the
conservatory
and
little
edith
was
announcing
that
cousin
patty
had
a
crimson
gambler
she
means
crimson
rambler
exclaimed
patty
or
as
pansy
calls
it
bunchy
rosebush
although
the
guests
had
been
invited
to
a
dinner
yet
when
the
clock
hands
pointed
to
nearly
three
the
meal
had
not
been
announced
there
was
so
much
to
be
talked
about
that
the
time
did
not
drag
but
aunt
alice
looked
at
patty
a
little
curiously
patty
caught
the
glance
and
excusing
herself
went
out
into
the
kitchen
mancy
she
exclaimed
it
almost
three
why
do
you
have
dinner
well
honey
yo
took
so
much
of
my
time
mashin
your
old
nuts
dat
my
work

put
behind

come
on
after
a
while
it
mos
ready
patty
went
back
to
the
parlour
laughing
if
anybody
can
hurry
up
mancy
she
said
they
welcome
to
try
it
i
did
realise
it
was
so
late
and
i
awfully
sorry
but
i
guess

said
frank

of
the
rest
of
us
are
i
assure
you
although
served
about
an
hour
late
the
dinner
was
a
great
success
it
had
been
carefully
planned
mancy
cooking
was
beyond
reproach
and
pansy
potts
proved
a
and
if
inexperienced
phyllis
encouraged
by
the
general
excellence
of
the
courses
as
they
succeeded
one
another
patty
began
to
hope
that
her
gorgeous
dessert
would
turn
out
all
right
after
all
seated
at
the
head
of
her
own
table
she
made
a
charming
little
hostess
and
many
a
glance
of
happy
understanding
passed
between
her
and
the
gentleman
who
presided
at
the
other
end
i
say
patty
it
right
down
jolly
you
having
a
house
of
your
own
said
frank
except
that
we
miss
you
awfully
over
home
added
uncle
charley
i
do
see
how
you
can
said
patty
smiling
as
i
took
breakfast
there
this
morning
you
have
yet
gathered
round
your
lonely
board
without
me
no
but
we
shall
have
to
said
uncle
charley
and
it
is
that
which
is
breaking
my
young
heart
well
is
what
breaking
young
heart
said
patty
as
she
watched
pansy
potts
who
was
just
entering
the
room
with
a
dish
containing
a
most
failure
i
may
as
well
own
up
she
said
bravely
as
the
dessert
was
placed
in
front
of
her
my
ambition
was
greater
than
my
ability
do
say
another
word
said
aunt
alice
understand
those
things
are
monuments
of
total
depravity
patty
gave
her
aunt
a
grateful
glance
and
said
they
certainly
are
aunt
alice
and
i
never
attempt
one
again
until
i
made
myself
perfect
by
long
practice
good
for
you
my
irish
pat
said
frank
but
do
you
know
i
like
them
better
this
way
there
an
attraction
about
that
general
conglomeration
that
appeals
to
me
more
strongly
than
those
concoctions
that
look
as
if
they
had
sat
in
a
caterer
window
for
weeks
but
notwithstanding
frank
complimentary
impulses
the
dessert
proved
uneatable
and
had
to
be
replaced
with
crackers
and
cheese
and
fruit
and
bonbons
chapter
ix
a
caller
it
was
quite
late
in
the
evening
before
the
elliotts
left
boxley
hall
but
after
they
had
gone
patty
and
her
father
still
lingered
in
the
library
for
a
bit
of
cosey
chat
is
it
lovely
said
patty
with
a
little
sigh
of
extreme
content
to
sit
down
in
our
own
library
and
talk
over
our
own
party
and
by
the
way
papa
how
do
you
like
our
library
is
it
all
your
fancy
painted
it
yes
said
fairfield
looking
around
critically
the
library
is
all
right
but
of
course
as
yet
it
is
young
and
inexperienced
it
remains
for
us
to
train
it
up
in
the
way
it
should
go
and
i
feel
sure
under
our
ministrations
and
loving
care
it
will
grow
better
as
it
grows
older
we
certainly
got
good
material
to
work
on
said
patty
giving
a
satisfied
glance
around
the
pretty
room
and
now
man
tell
me
what
you
think
of
our
first
effort
at
hospitality
how
did
the
dinner
party
go
off
today
it
went
off
with
flying
colours
and
you
certainly
deserve
a
great
deal
of
credit
for
your
very
successful
first
appearance
as
a
hostess
of
course
if
one
were
disposed
to
be
critical
one
would
say
that
one
elaborate
dessert
was
a
very
successful
imitation
of
a
complete
failure
interrupted
fairfield
laughing
and
this
is
where
i
shall
take
an
opportunity
to
point
a
moral
it
is
not
good
proportion
to
undertake
a
difficult
and
complicated
recipe
for
the
first
time
when
you
are
expecting
guests
no
i
know
it
said
patty
and
yet
papa
you
would
expect
me
to
have
that
gorgeous
french
mess
for
dinner
when
we
all
alone
would
you
and
so
when
could
we
have
it
your
implication
does
seem
to
bar
the
beautiful
confection
from
our
table
entirely
and
yet
do
you
know
it
would
alarm
me
a
bit
to
have
that
dessert
attack
us
some
night
when
you
and
i
are
at
dinner
quite
alone
and
unprotected
all
right
papa
we
have
it
and
i
sure
after
another
trial
i
can
make
it
just
as
it
should
be
made
do
be
too
sure
my
child
is
a
good
thing
in
its
place
but
is
a
quality
not
nearly
so
attractive
i
think
patty
girl
and
here
fairfield
put
his
arm
around
his
daughter
and
looked
very
kindly
into
her
eyes
i
think
every
new
year
day
i
shall
give
you
a
bit
of
good
advice
by
way
of
correcting
whatever
seems
to
me
at
the
time
to
be
your
besetting
sin
patty
smiled
back
at
her
father
with
loving
confidence
but
if
you
only
reform
me
at
the
rate
of
one
sin
per
year
it
will
be
a
long
while
before
i
become
a
good
girl
she
said
you
a
good
girl
now
said
her
father
patting
her
head
really
a
very
good
girl
for
your
age
and
if
i
correct
your
faults
at
the
rate
of
one
a
year
i
do
think
i
can
keep
up
with
the
performance
for
very
many
years
but
seriously
pattikins
what
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
now
is
your
apparent
inclination
toward
a
certain
kind
of
filigree
elaborateness
which
is
out
of
proportion
to
our
simple
mode
of
living
i
have
noticed
that
you
have
a
decided
admiration
for
appointments
and
services
that
are
only
appropriate
in
houses
run
on
a
really
magnificent
scale
where
the
corps
of
servants
includes
a
butler
and
other
trained
functionaries
now
you
know
my
child
that
with
your
present
retinue
you
can
not
achieve
startling
effects
in
the
way
of
household
glories
am
i
making
myself
clear
well
you
not
so
awfully
clear
but
i
gather
that
you
thought
that
ridiculous
pudding
i
tried
to
make
was
out
of
proportion
to
pansy
potts
as
waitress
you
have
grasped
my
meaning
wonderfully
well
said
her
father
but
it
was
not
only
the
pudding
i
had
in
mind
but
several
ambitious
attempts
at
an
of
grandeur
and
elegance
well
but
papa
i
like
to
have
things
nice
yes
but
be
careful
not
to
have
them
more
nice
than
wise
however
there
is
no
necessity
for
dwelling
on
this
subject
i
see
you
understand
what
i
mean
and
i
know
now
that
i
have
called
your
attention
to
it
your
own
sense
of
proportion
will
guide
you
right
if
you
remember
to
follow
its
dictates
but
do
you
imagine
said
patty
roguishly
that
such
a
mild
scolding
as
that
is
going
to
do
a
hardened
reprobate
like
me
any
good
yes
said
her
father
decidedly
i
think
it
will
so
do
i
said
patty
next
morning
at
breakfast
patty
could
scarcely
eat
so
enthusiastic
was
she
over
the
delightful
sensation
of
breakfasting
alone
with
her
father
in
their
own
very
carefully
she
poured
his
coffee
for
him
and
very
carefully
pansy
potts
carried
the
cup
to
its
destination
i
did
ask
marian
to
stay
last
night
slid
patty
because
i
wanted
our
first
night
and
our
first
breakfast
all
alone
by
ourselves
you
a
sentimental
little
puss
said
her
father
yes
i
think
i
am
said
patty
do
you
mind
not
at
all
if
you
keep
your
sentiment
in
its
proper
place
and
let
it
interfere
with
the
somewhat
prosaic
duties
that
have
of
late
come
into
your
life
gracious
goodness
sakes
said
patty
that
reminds
me
what
shall
i
order
from
the
butcher
this
morning
do
ask
me
said
fairfield
i
object
to
being
implicated
in
matters
so
entirely
outside
my
own
domain
oh
certainly
said
patty
that
all
right
i
beg
your
pardon
i
sure
and
do
feel
alarmed
i
promise
you
shall
have
a
dinner
i
no
doubt
of
it
and
now
baby
i
must
be
off
to
catch
my
train
do
get
lonesome
have
a
good
time
and
forget
that
your
father
scolded
you
as
if
i
minded
that
little
feathery
scolding
come
home
early
and
bring
me
something
nice
from
the
city
left
to
herself
patty
began
to
keep
house
with
great
diligence
she
planned
the
meals
for
the
day
made
out
orders
for
market
gave
the
flowers
in
the
vases
fresh
water
and
looking
in
at
the
conservatory
she
found
pansy
potts
digging
around
the
potted
daisies
with
a
hairpin
pansy
she
said
kindly
i
glad
to
have
you
take
care
of
the
flowers
but
you
must
spend
all
your
time
in
here
have
you
straightened
up
in
the
yet
no
said
pansy
but
these
little
daisies
cried
so
loud
to
be
looked
after
that
i
just
could
neglect
them
another
minute
see
how
they
laugh
when
i
tickle
up
the
dirt
around
their
toes
that
all
very
well
pansy
said
patty
laughing
herself
but
i
want
you
to
do
your
work
properly
and
at
the
right
time
now
leave
the
daisies
until
the
and
bedrooms
are
all
in
order
yes
miss
patty
said
pansy
and
though
she
cast
a
lingering
farewell
glance
at
the
beloved
posies
she
went
cheerfully
about
her
duties
now
thought
pansy
i
telephone
to
marian
to
come
over
this
afternoon
and
stay
to
dinner
and
stay
all
night
then
we
can
arrange
about
having
the
tea
club
why
there
the
doorbell
perhaps
that
marian
now
i
do
know
who
else
it
could
be
i
sure
in
a
few
moments
pansy
potts
appeared
and
offered
patty
a
card
on
a
very
new
and
very
shiny
tray
for
goodness
sake
who
is
it
pansy
asked
patty
reading
the
card
which
only
said
miss
rachel
daggett
i
do
know
miss
patty
i
sure
she
asked
for
you
and
i
said
go
right
down
very
well
i
will
said
patty
a
glance
in
the
mirror
showed
a
crisp
fresh
and
neatly
brushed
hair
so
patty
ran
down
to
the
library
to
welcome
her
guest
the
guest
proved
to
be
a
large
tall
and
altogether
lady
who
spoke
with
a
great
deal
of
firmness
and
decision
i
am
miss
daggett
she
said
and
i
am
your
neighbour
are
you
said
patty
pleasantly
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
and
i
hope
you
will
like
me
for
a
neighbour
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
or
not
said
miss
daggett
it
depends
entirely
on
how
you
behave
although
patty
was
extremely
she
could
help
feeling
a
little
inclined
to
resent
the
tone
taken
by
her
guest
and
she
returned
rather
crisply
i
shall
try
to
behave
as
a
lady
and
a
neighbour
humph
said
miss
daggett
you
promising
a
good
deal
if
you
accomplish
what
you
mentioned
i
shall
consider
you
the
best
neighbour
i
ever
experienced
in
my
life
patty
began
to
think
her
strange
guest
was
eccentric
rather
than
impolite
and
began
to
take
a
fancy
to
the
somewhat
brusque
visitor
i
live
said
miss
daggett
and
i
am
by
no
means
social
in
my
habits
indeed
i
prefer
to
let
my
neighbours
alone
and
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
asking
them
to
call
upon
me
i
will
do
just
as
you
like
said
patty
politely
call
upon
you
or
not
it
is
not
my
habit
to
call
on
people
who
do
not
care
to
see
me
but
on
the
other
hand
i
shall
be
happy
to
call
upon
such
of
my
neighbours
as
ask
me
to
do
so
oh
people
do
have
to
call
upon
each
other
merely
because
they
are
neighbours
said
miss
daggett
and
that
why
i
came
in
here
to
let
you
understand
my
ideas
on
this
matter
i
have
lived
to
this
house
for
many
years
and
i
have
never
cared
to
associate
with
the
people
who
have
lived
in
it
i
have
no
reason
to
think
that
you
will
prove
of
any
more
interest
to
me
that
any
of
the
others
who
have
lived
here
indeed
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
you
will
prove
of
less
interest
to
me
because
you
are
so
young
and
inexperienced
that
i
feel
sure
you
will
be
a
regular
nuisance
and
i
would
like
you
to
understand
once
for
all
that
you
are
not
to
come
to
me
for
advice
or
assistance
when
you
make
absurd
and
ridiculous
mistakes
as
you
bound
to
do
at
first
patty
had
grown
indignant
at
miss
daggett
conversation
but
soon
she
felt
rather
amused
at
what
was
doubtless
the
idiosyncrasy
of
an
eccentric
mind
and
she
answered
i
will
promise
not
to
come
to
you
for
advice
or
warning
no
matter
how
much
i
may
need
assistance
that
right
said
miss
daggett
very
earnestly
and
remember
please
that
your
cook
is
not
to
come
over
to
my
house
to
borrow
anything
not
even
eggs
butter
or
lemons
i
promise
that
too
said
patty
trying
not
to
laugh
though
she
could
help
thinking
that
her
first
caller
was
an
extraordinary
one
well
you
really
behave
quite
well
said
miss
daggett
i
am
very
much
surprised
at
you
i
came
over
here
partly
to
warn
you
against
interfering
with
myself
and
my
household
but
also
because
i
wanted
to
see
what
you
like
i
had
heard
that
you
were
going
to
live
in
this
house
and
that
you
were
going
to
keep
house
yourself
and
though
i
was
much
surprised
that
your
father
would
let
you
do
such
a
thing
yet
i
help
thinking
that
you
really
quite
sensible
yet
i
want
you
to
understand
that
you
are
not
to
borrow
things
from
my
kitchen
i
am
glad
that
you
think
i
sensible
said
patty
looking
earnestly
at
her
visitor
toward
whom
she
felt
somehow
drawn
in
despite
of
her
queer
manners
and
i
promise
not
to
borrow
anything
from
you
under
any
circumstances
that
is
all
right
said
miss
daggett
rising
and
that
is
all
i
came
to
say
to
you
i
will
now
go
home
and
if
i
ever
feel
that
i
want
you
to
return
this
call
i
will
let
you
know
otherwise
please
remember
that
i
do
not
care
to
have
it
returned
patty
showed
her
guest
to
the
door
and
dismissed
her
with
a
polite
well
she
exclaimed
to
herself
as
miss
daggett
walked
out
of
the
front
gate
with
an
air
of
stalwart
dignity
that
a
delightful
specimen
of
a
caller
but
i
hope
i
wo
have
many
more
like
that
she
a
queer
kind
of
a
neighbour
but
somehow
i
rather
think
if
i
saw
her
more
i
should
like
her
better
chapter
x
a
pleasant
evening
marian
came
to
dinner
and
frank
came
with
her
as
he
announced
when
he
entered
he
had
had
no
invitation
but
he
said
he
did
not
hesitate
on
that
account
i
should
think
not
said
patty
i
expect
all
the
elliott
family
to
live
at
my
house
and
only
go
home
occasionally
to
visit
so
frank
proceeded
to
make
himself
at
home
and
when
fairfield
arrived
a
little
later
and
dinner
was
served
it
was
a
very
merry
party
of
four
that
sat
down
to
the
table
as
patty
had
promised
her
father
the
dinner
was
excellent
and
it
was
with
a
pardonable
pride
that
she
dispensed
the
hospitality
of
her
own
table
what
the
dessert
going
to
be
patty
asked
frank
tongues
i
suppose
served
on
do
be
rude
frank
said
his
sister
you
probably
causing
your
hostess
great
embarrassment
not
at
all
said
patty
i
am
now
such
an
old
experienced
housekeeper
that
i
not
disturbed
by
such
insinuations
i
sorry
to
disappoint
you
frank
but
the
dessert
is
a
very
simple
one
however
you
are
now
about
to
have
a
most
marvellous
concoction
called
salad
i
was
a
little
uncertain
as
to
how
it
would
turn
out
so
i
thought
i
try
it
tonight
as
i
knew
my
guests
would
be
both
and
hungry
that
a
combination
of
virtues
that
do
always
go
together
said
fairfield
i
hope
the
young
people
appreciate
the
compliment
to
be
and
hungry
at
the
same
time
implies
a
disposition
little
short
of
angelic
so
you
see
said
marian
you
not
entertaining
these
angels
unawares
bravo
pretty
good
for
mally
said
frank
applauding
his
speech
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
remark
on
such
a
delicate
subject
your
salad
is
also
pretty
good
patty
it
more
than
pretty
good
said
marian
it
a
howling
screaming
shouting
success
i
am
endeavouring
to
find
out
what
it
made
of
you
ca
do
it
said
fairfield
i
have
tried
too
and
it
seems
to
include
everything
that
ever
grew
on
the
earth
beneath
or
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
your
guesses
are
not
far
out
of
the
way
said
patty
composedly
i
will
not
attempt
to
deny
that
that
complicated
and
exceedingly
frenchified
salad
is
concocted
from
certain
remainders
that
were
set
away
in
the
refrigerator
after
yesterday
dinner
who
would
have
believed
it
exclaimed
frank
looking
at
his
plate
with
mock
awe
and
reverence
materials
count
for
very
little
in
a
salad
said
marian
with
a
wise
and
didactic
air
its
whole
success
depends
on
the
way
it
is
put
together
now
that
a
true
compliment
said
patty
and
it
is
mine
for
i
made
this
salad
all
myself
after
dinner
they
adjourned
to
the
library
and
the
girls
fell
to
making
plans
for
the
tea
club
which
was
to
meet
there
next
day
i
do
think
said
marian
it
awfully
mean
of
helen
preston
to
insist
on
having
a
bazaar
they
so
and
silly
and
we
could
get
up
some
novel
entertainment
that
would
make
just
as
much
money
and
be
a
lot
more
fun
besides
i
know
it
said
patty
i
just
hate
bazaars
with
their
everlasting
rebeccas
at
the
well
and
and
and
but
then
what
could
we
have
why
there
are
two
or
three
of
those
little
acting
shows
that
elsie
morris
told
us
about
i
think
they
would
be
a
great
deal
nicer
what
sort
of
acting
shows
are
you
talking
about
my
children
and
what
is
it
all
to
be
asked
fairfield
who
was
always
interested
in
patty
plans
why
papa
it
the
tea
club
you
know
and
we
going
to
have
an
entertainment
to
make
money
for
the
day
nursery
oh
you
just
ought
to
see
those
cunning
little
babies
and
they
have
room
enough
or
nurses
enough
or
anything
and
you
know
the
tea
club
never
has
done
any
good
in
the
world
we
never
done
a
thing
but
sit
around
and
giggle
and
so
we
thought
if
we
could
make
a
hundred
dollars
would
it
be
nice
the
hundred
dollars
would
be
very
nice
indeed
but
just
how
are
you
going
to
make
it
what
this
about
an
acting
play
oh
not
a
regular
play
just
a
sort
of
dialogue
thing
you
know
and
we
have
it
in
library
hall
and
aunt
alice
and
a
lot
of
her
friends
would
be
patronesses
it
would
seem
to
me
said
frank
that
miss
patty
fairfield
now
being
an
old
and
experienced
housekeeper
could
qualify
as
a
patroness
herself
no
thank
you
said
patty
i
housekeeper
for
my
father
and
in
my
father
house
but
to
the
great
outside
world
i
still
a
shy
and
bashful
young
miss
you
do
look
the
part
said
frank
you
ought
to
go
around
with
your
finger
in
your
mouth
why
did
you
tell
me
sooner
said
patty
i
shall
begin
to
cultivate
the
habit
at
once
do
said
marian
i
sure
it
would
be
becoming
to
you
but
perhaps
hard
on
your
gloves
well
there
one
thing
certain
said
patty
i
would
really
rather
put
my
finger
in
my
mouth
than
to
crook
out
my
little
finger
in
that
absurd
way
that
so
many
people
do
why
florence
douglass
never
lifts
a
cup
of
tea
that
she
does
crook
out
her
little
finger
and
then
think
she
a
very
pattern
of
all
that
elegant
i
know
it
said
marian
i
think
it
horrid
too
it
nothing
but
airs
i
know
lots
of
people
who
do
it
when
they
all
dressed
up
but
who
never
think
of
such
a
thing
when
they
are
alone
at
home
i
wonder
what
the
real
reason
is
said
patty
thoughtfully
it
is
an
announcement
of
refinement
said
fairfield
falling
in
with
his
daughter
train
of
thought
and
as
we
all
know
the
refinement
that
needs
to
be
announced
is
no
refinement
at
all
we
therefore
see
that
the
conspicuously
curved
little
finger
is
but
an
advertisement
of
a
specious
and
flimsy
imitation
of
aristocracy
papa
you
certainly
do
know
it
all
said
patty
i
have
any
words
by
me
just
now
long
enough
to
answer
you
with
but
i
quite
agree
with
you
in
spirit
that
all
very
well
said
frank
for
a
modern
explanation
but
the
real
root
of
the
matter
goes
far
back
into
the
obscure
ages
of
antiquity
the
whole
habit
is
a
relic
of
barbarism
probably
in
the
early
ages
only
the
great
had
cups
to
drink
from
these
few
to
protect
themselves
from
their
envious
and
covetous
brethren
stuck
out
their
little
fingers
to
ward
off
possible
assaults
upon
their
porcelain
property
this
ingrained
impulse
the
ages
have
been
unable
to
eradicate
hence
we
find
the
little
finger
crooks
upon
the
earth
what
an
ingenious
boy
you
are
said
patty
looking
at
her
cousin
with
mock
admiration
how
did
you
ever
think
of
all
that
that
is
ingenuity
miss
it
historic
research
and
you
probably
find
that
florence
douglass
can
trace
her
ancestry
right
back
to
the
aforesaid
barbarians
i
suppose
most
of
us
are
descended
from
primitive
people
said
marian
and
then
the
entrance
of
elsie
morris
and
her
brother
guy
put
an
end
to
the
discussion
of
little
fingers
i
so
glad
to
see
you
said
patty
welcoming
her
callers
come
right
into
the
library
you
are
our
first
real
guests
then
i
think
we
ought
to
have
the
prize
for
promptness
said
elsie
as
she
took
off
her
wraps
but
do
you
count
frank
and
marian
not
as
guests
replied
patty
they
relatives
and
you
know
your
relatives
are
like
the
poor
interrupted
frank
because
they
always
with
you
then
we
are
really
your
first
callers
said
guy
morris
no
not
quite
said
patty
laughing
i
spoke
too
hastily
when
i
said
that
and
forgot
entirely
a
very
distinguished
personage
who
visited
me
this
morning
who
was
it
my
neighbour
miss
daggett
what
not
locky
ann
daggett
exclaimed
elsie
laughing
merrily
it
was
miss
rachel
daggett
i
do
know
why
you
call
her
by
that
queer
name
said
patty
oh
i
known
her
ever
since
i
was
a
baby
and
mother
always
calls
her
locky
ann
daggett
and
grandmother
did
before
her
you
know
locky
is
a
nickname
for
rachel
i
did
know
it
said
patty
what
an
absurd
nickname
yes
is
it
how
did
you
like
her
it
is
a
question
of
liking
answered
patty
she
does
want
me
to
like
her
all
she
seemed
to
care
about
was
to
have
me
promise
not
to
interfere
with
her
oh
she
afraid
of
you
said
guy
you
do
seem
so
very
terrifying
now
but
i
suppose
when
you
engaged
in
the
housekeeping
of
your
house
you
an
imposing
and
sight
i
dare
say
i
am
said
patty
but
my
neighbour
miss
daggett
i
sure
would
be
imposing
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
she
a
queer
character
said
elsie
have
you
never
seen
her
before
no
i
never
even
heard
of
her
until
she
sent
up
her
card
why
how
funny
said
marian
i
always
heard
of
locky
ann
daggett
but
i
never
knew
anything
about
her
except
that
she
very
old
and
very
queer
she
a
sort
of
humourous
character
said
guy
morris
you
know
and
eccentric
but
not
half
bad
i
quite
like
the
old
lady
though
i
almost
never
see
her
no
she
does
seem
to
care
to
see
people
said
patty
she
seems
to
have
no
taste
for
society
why
i
do
suppose
she
care
to
take
part
in
our
play
even
if
we
invited
her
oh
what
about
the
play
said
elsie
have
you
really
decided
to
have
a
play
instead
of
that
stupid
old
fair
we
have
decided
anything
said
patty
we
ca
until
the
club
meets
oh
do
have
a
play
said
frank
and
then
us
fellows
can
take
part
we
could
do
anything
at
a
bazaar
except
stand
around
and
buy
things
and
we
of
histrionic
talent
put
in
guy
you
ought
to
see
me
do
hamlet
yes
said
frank
guy
hamlet
is
quite
the
funniest
thing
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
do
love
comedy
so
do
i
said
guy
i
just
love
to
play
a
part
like
hamlet
then
you
may
have
a
chance
said
marian
for
one
of
the
plays
thinking
about
and
it
is
exactly
a
play
either
brings
in
a
whole
lot
of
tragic
characters
in
a
humourous
way
it
a
general
you
know
hamlet
and
sairy
gamp
and
rip
van
winkle
and
old
mother
hubbard
and
everybody
yes
that
a
good
one
said
marian
it
called
at
the
seashore
the
name
is
enough
to
condemn
that
piece
said
fairfield
not
one
of
you
can
say
it
straight
and
sure
enough
though
numerous
attempts
were
made
and
much
laughter
ensued
none
entirely
successful
chapter
xi
preparations
with
the
instincts
of
a
true
hostess
patty
had
slipped
from
the
room
unobserved
and
had
held
a
short
confab
with
her
two
trusty
servitors
in
the
kitchen
but
miss
patty
expostulated
mancy
dey
ai
nuffin
fit
to
set
befo
dem
fren
ob
yo
dey
ai
nuffin
skacely
in
de
house
some
bits
ob
candies
an
cakaroons
le
from
yo
las
night
supper
well
that
all
right
said
patty
let
pansy
arrange
those
nicely
on
the
table
use
the
silver
dishes
pansy
and
fix
them
just
as
i
told
you
yes
miss
patty
said
pansy
but
there
are
very
many
left
well
then
mancy
i
tell
you
what
you
make
us
a
nice
pot
of
chocolate
and
fix
us
some
thin
bread
and
butter
and
cut
up
some
of
the
fruit
cake
to
put
with
those
little
fancy
cakes
wo
that
do
yas
i
spec
so
but
it
a
mighty
slim
layout
for
dem
hearty
young
chaps
but
you
go
honey
i
fix
it
somehow
and
sure
enough
she
did
fix
it
somehow
for
when
a
little
later
patty
invited
her
young
friends
out
into
the
the
thin
bread
and
butter
had
doubled
itself
up
into
most
attractive
and
satisfying
and
there
was
also
a
plate
of
delicious
toasted
crackers
and
cheese
fairfield
added
a
box
of
candy
which
he
had
brought
home
from
new
york
and
the
unpretentious
little
feast
proved
most
enjoyable
to
all
concerned
i
should
think
you
would
feel
all
the
time
as
if
you
were
acting
a
play
yourself
patty
said
elsie
morris
taking
her
seat
at
the
prettily
laid
table
i
do
said
patty
as
she
took
her
own
place
at
the
head
it
awfully
hard
to
realise
that
i
am
monarch
of
all
i
survey
but
you
have
someone
to
dispute
your
right
said
her
father
and
i
glad
of
it
said
patty
whatever
should
i
do
living
here
all
alone
just
with
my
rights
by
her
rights
she
means
her
cousins
put
in
frank
yes
said
patty
they
about
as
right
as
anything
i
know
and
so
the
evening
passed
in
merry
chaff
and
fun
and
at
its
close
the
young
guests
all
went
away
except
marian
who
was
going
to
spend
the
night
at
boxley
hall
after
her
cousin
had
gone
upstairs
to
her
pretty
blue
bedroom
patty
lingered
a
moment
in
the
library
for
a
word
with
her
father
how
am
i
getting
along
papa
she
said
how
about
the
proportion
the
market
seems
pretty
strong
on
proportion
patty
dear
your
housekeeping
is
beginning
wonderfully
well
that
little
dinner
you
gave
us
was
in
every
respect
and
the
simple
refreshments
you
had
this
evening
were
very
pretty
and
graceful
do
praise
me
too
much
papa
or
i
grow
conceited
you
get
praise
from
me
my
lady
just
when
you
deserve
it
and
at
no
other
time
now
skip
along
to
bed
or
you
have
too
great
a
proportion
of
late
hours
with
a
kiss
patty
went
singing
upstairs
feeling
sure
that
she
was
the
happiest
and
most
fortunate
little
girl
in
the
world
so
impressed
was
she
with
her
realisation
of
this
fact
that
she
announced
it
to
marian
marian
looked
at
her
curiously
you
fortunate
in
some
ways
she
said
but
the
real
reason
you
always
so
happy
i
think
is
because
of
your
happy
disposition
a
great
many
girls
with
no
mother
or
brother
or
sister
who
had
all
the
care
and
responsibility
of
a
big
house
and
whose
father
was
away
all
day
would
think
they
had
a
pretty
miserable
life
but
that
never
seems
to
occur
to
you
no
said
patty
contentedly
and
i
do
believe
it
ever
will
the
next
morning
patty
devoted
all
her
energy
to
getting
ready
for
the
tea
club
she
declined
marian
offers
of
help
saying
no
i
really
do
need
any
help
if
i
can
keep
pansy
out
of
the
conservatory
we
three
can
accomplish
all
there
is
to
be
done
so
you
go
and
sit
by
the
library
fire
and
toast
your
toes
and
read
or
play
with
the
cat
or
do
whatever
you
please
remember
whenever
you
come
here
you
one
of
the
family
so
marian
went
off
by
herself
and
played
on
the
piano
and
read
and
had
various
kinds
of
good
times
scrupulously
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
her
busy
and
preoccupied
cousin
now
pansy
said
patty
as
she
captured
that
culprit
in
the
conservatory
and
led
her
off
to
the
kitchen
i
want
you
to
try
especially
hard
to
do
just
as
i
want
you
to
and
to
help
me
in
every
possible
way
can
i
fix
the
flowers
miss
patty
said
pansy
potts
her
eyes
sparkling
with
delight
where
are
there
any
flowers
to
fix
you
fussed
over
those
in
the
conservatory
until
you
nearly
worn
them
all
out
oh
miss
patty
they
thriving
beautifully
but
i
mean
that
big
box
of
flowers
that
just
came
up
from
the
flower
man
he
said
fairfield
sent
it
oh
exclaimed
patty
did
papa
really
send
me
up
flowers
for
the
tea
club
how
perfectly
lovely
i
meant
to
order
some
myself
but
i
know
his
will
be
nicer
by
this
time
patty
was
diving
into
the
big
box
and
scattering
tissue
paper
all
about
they
beautiful
she
exclaimed
and
what
lots
of
them
yes
pansy
you
may
arrange
them
you
really
do
it
better
than
i
do
keep
all
the
pink
ones
for
the
and
put
the
others
wherever
you
like
now
mancy
she
went
on
we
discuss
what
to
eat
yas
and
i
it
be
some
ob
dem
highfalutin
fandangoes
ob
yo
what
nobody
ca
eat
you
guessed
right
the
very
first
time
said
patty
smiling
back
at
the
old
cook
whose
bark
was
so
much
worse
than
her
bite
you
see
mancy
this
is
my
own
party
and
so
i
can
have
just
what
i
like
at
it
not
even
papa
can
object
to
the
things
that
i
have
for
my
own
tea
club
dat
so
chile
but
yo
knows
mighty
likely
to
spoil
dem
good
befo
yo
get
made
oh
i
do
think
i
will
this
time
said
patty
with
that
assured
little
toss
of
her
head
which
always
meant
perfect
confidence
in
her
own
ability
mancy
said
nothing
but
grunted
somewhat
doubtfully
as
patty
went
on
to
describe
the
beautiful
things
she
intended
to
have
i
want
rissoles
she
said
as
she
turned
over
the
and
looked
in
the
index
for
they
awfully
good
what
dem
missy
i
never
heard
tell
of
i
forget
what
they
are
said
patty
but
we
had
them
at
delmonico
one
day
when
papa
and
i
were
there
at
lunch
and
i
remember
thinking
then
they
be
nice
for
the
tea
club
they
were
either
some
little
kind
of
a
cake
or
else
a
sort
of
croquette
either
would
be
nice
you
know
why
they
not
here
what
a
silly
book
not
to
have
them
in
oh
well
never
mind
here
maids
of
honour
we
used
to
have
those
at
aunt
isabel
and
they
the
loveliest
things
i
make
those
mancy
and
while
i
doing
it
you
make
me
some
wine
jelly
and
some
bavarian
cream
and
then
i
can
put
them
together
with
and
candied
cherries
and
whipped
cream
and
things
and
make
a
royal
diplomatic
pudding
like
yo
makin
things
fine
enough
for
a
weddin
growled
mancy
well
now
look
here
last
night
you
thought
the
things
i
had
for
my
evening
company
were
too
plain
and
now
you
grumbling
because
too
fancy
laws
honey
ca
you
see
no
diffunce
plain
bread
and
butter
and
a
lot
of
pernicketty
gimcracks
that
never
turns
out
right
nohow
a
haunting
doubt
regarding
the
proportion
between
her
elaborate
plans
and
the
simple
tea
club
hovered
round
patty
mind
but
she
resolutely
put
it
aside
thinking
to
herself
i
do
care
it
my
first
function
and
i
going
to
have
it
just
as
nice
as
i
can
patty
always
felt
particularly
grand
and
grown
up
when
she
used
the
word
and
now
that
she
had
mentally
applied
it
to
the
tea
club
meeting
that
simple
affair
seemed
to
take
on
a
gigantic
amplitude
and
fairly
seemed
to
cry
out
for
elaborate
devices
of
all
sorts
never
you
mind
mancy
she
said
you
just
go
ahead
and
do
as
i
tell
you
get
the
jelly
and
cream
ready
and
i
do
the
rest
but
ai
yo
gwine
to
have
no
solidstantial
kind
o
food
oh
yes
of
course
i
want
a
of
chicken
and
humph
said
mancy
her
patience
giving
out
at
this
ef
yo
does
hab
to
talk
english
patty
laughed
you
must
get
used
to
these
names
mancy
because
these
are
the
kind
of
things
i
like
well
you
just
boil
a
couple
of
chickens
and
cut
them
up
small
and
see
that
there
are
two
loaves
of
bread
ready
those
long
round
crimply
ones
you
know
and
then
i
put
it
all
together
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
brown
it
and
i
show
you
how
to
make
the
after
lunch
you
might
as
well
learn
once
for
all
you
know
there
bacon
in
the
house
is
there
no
dey
ai
is
yo
fren
gwine

ter
breakfus
oh
no
i
want
the
bacon
for
the
do
worry
mancy
they
all
come
out
right
dey
mought
and
den
again
dey
mought
grumbled
the
old
woman
but
undaunted
patty
went
on
measuring
and
weighing
with
a
surety
of
success
that
is
found
only
in
the
young
and
inexperienced
at
one
marian
walked
out
into
the
kitchen
good
gracious
patty
fairfield
she
exclaimed
what
are
you
doing
and
what
are
all
those
things
do
you
expect
the
democratic
convention
to
be
entertained
here
or
are
you
going
to
give
the
a
picnic
and
are
we
never
to
have
lunch
i
simply
starving
patty
turned
a
flushed
face
to
her
cousin
and
looked
dazed
and
bewildered
two
and
ounces
of
sugar
she
said
spun
to
a
thread
add
chopped
nuts
and
the
whites
of
six
eggs
brown
with
a
salamander
marian
i
have
any
salamander
the
tragic
tone
of
patty
awful
avowal
was
too
much
for
marian
and
she
dropped
into
a
kitchen
chair
and
went
off
into
peals
of
laughter
patty
she
cried
you
goose
what
are
you
doing
just
making
up
the
whole
page
by
page
i
believe
you
crazy
it
for
the
tea
club
exclaimed
patty
and
i
want
things
to
be
nice
h
said
marian
and
they
nice
she
glanced
at
some
of
the
completed
delicacies
on
the
table
and
patty
seeing
the
look
turned
red
again
but
this
time
it
was
not
the
effect
of
the
kitchen
range
well
she
said
some
of
them
are
quite
right
but
i
think
the
others
will
be
and
i
think
you
working
too
hard
said
marian
kindly
you
come
away
with
me
now
and
rest
a
little
bit
and
mancy
you
put
a
little
lunch
for
us
on
the
table
wo
you
just
anything
will
do
you
know
chapter
xii
a
tea
club
tea
patty
rebelled
at
being
overruled
in
this
manner
but
marian
had
some
fairfield
firmness
of
her
own
and
taking
her
cousin
arm
led
her
to
the
library
and
plumped
her
down
upon
the
couch
in
a
reclining
position
while
she
vigorously
jammed
pillows
under
her
head
there
miss
she
announced
you
will
please
stay
there
until
luncheon
is
announced
but
marian
pleaded
patty
seeing
that
resistance
was
useless
such
a
lot
of
things
to
do
and
the
girls
will
be
here
before
i
get
them
all
done
let
them
come
said
the
marian
it
wo
hurt
them
a
bit
and
you
got
enough
things
done
now
to
feed
the
russian
army
but
they
not
finished
said
patty
and
they
spoil
standing
you
more
likely
spoil
them
by
finishing
them
now
you
stay
right
where
you
are
so
patty
rested
until
pansy
came
and
called
them
to
a
most
appetising
little
lunch
spread
very
simply
on
the
the
two
hungry
girls
did
full
justice
to
it
and
then
patty
said
now
marian
you
a
duck
and
you
mean
well
i
know
but
this
is
my
house
and
my
and
now
you
must
clear
out
and
leave
me
to
fix
it
up
pretty
in
my
own
way
all
right
said
marian
i
rescued
you
once
now
this
time
leave
you
to
your
fate
but
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
those
tea
club
girls
would
rather
have
a
few
nice
little
things
like
we
had
at
lunch
than
all
those
ridiculous
contraptions
that
you
got
out
there
half
baked
oh
me
oh
me
sighed
patty
in
mock
despair
nobody
appreciates
me
nobody
realises
or
cares
for
my
one
great
talent
i
believe
i
go
and
drown
myself
do
said
marian
drown
yourself
in
that
tub
of
for
it
will
never
stiffen
i
can
tell
that
by
looking
at
it
bye
bye
said
patty
pushing
marian
out
of
the
run
along
now
and
take
a
little
nap
like
a
good
little
girl
cousin
patty
must
set
the
table
all
nice
for
the
pretty
ladies
goose
was
the
only
comment
marian
vouchsafed
as
she
walked
away
then
patty
with
the
assistance
of
pansy
potts
proceeded
to
lay
the
table
elaborate
decoration
was
her
keynote
and
she
kept
well
in
tune
along
the
centre
of
the
table
over
the
damask
cloth
she
spread
a
rich
lace
runner
and
over
this
crossed
bands
of
wide
pink
satin
ribbon
ran
the
entire
diagonal
length
of
the
table
in
the
centre
was
a
large
bowl
of
pink
roses
and
at
each
corner
slender
vases
of
a
single
rose
in
each
also
single
roses
with
long
stems
and
leaves
were
laid
at
intervals
on
the
cloth
asparagus
fern
was
lavishly
used
and
candles
in
silver
candlesticks
adorned
the
table
small
silver
dishes
of
almonds
olives
and
confectionery
were
dotted
about
and
with
plates
were
set
out
on
the
certainly
it
was
all
very
beautiful
and
patty
surveyed
it
with
feelings
of
absolute
satisfaction
we
will
have
tea
at
five
pansy
she
said
and
just
before
that
you
light
the
candles
and
fill
the
glasses
and
see
that
everything
is
ready
yes
miss
patty
said
pansy
who
adored
her
young
mistress
and
who
was
especially
quick
in
learning
to
do
exactly
what
was
expected
of
her
the
afternoon
was
slipping
away
and
patty
suddenly
discovered
that
she
had
only
time
to
get
dressed
before
the
girls
would
arrive
so
she
announced
to
mancy
that
she
must
finish
up
such
things
as
were
not
finished
and
without
waiting
to
hear
the
old
woman
remarks
of
disapproval
patty
ran
up
to
her
room
there
she
found
that
marian
had
kindly
laid
out
her
dress
and
ribbons
for
her
and
was
ready
to
help
do
her
hair
you
a
good
old
thing
marian
she
said
as
she
dropped
into
a
chair
in
front
of
her
toilet
mirror
i
as
tired
as
a
bicycle
wheel
and
besides
i
do
love
to
have
somebody
do
my
hair
sometimes
pansy
does
it
but
she
too
busy
taking
days
as
they
go
said
marian
in
an
impersonal
manner
i
think
i
ever
saw
a
more
busy
one
than
has
seemed
to
be
the
tea
club
does
seem
to
make
a
most
awful
amount
of
fluster
in
a
new
house
yes
it
exacting
is
it
said
patty
who
caught
her
eye
in
the
mirror
and
looked
very
demure
though
she
refused
to
smile
there
are
some
of
the
girls
coming
in
at
the
front
gate
now
said
marian
as
she
tied
the
big
white
bow
on
patty
pretty
fluffy
hair
did
i
time
this
performance
just
right
you
did
indeed
said
patty
and
kissing
her
cousin
she
ran
gaily
downstairs
how
the
tea
club
girls
did
chatter
that
afternoon
there
was
so
much
to
see
and
talk
about
in
patty
new
home
and
there
were
also
other
weighty
matters
to
be
discussed
the
proposed
entertainment
was
an
engrossing
subject
and
as
various
opinions
were
held
the
arguments
were
lively
and
outspoken
you
can
talk
all
you
like
said
helen
preston
but
you
find
that
a
bazaar
will
be
the
most
sensible
thing
after
all
you
sure
to
make
a
lot
of
money
and
the
boys
will
help
and
we
all
know
exactly
what
to
do
and
how
to
go
about
it
it
may
be
sensible
said
laura
russell
but
it
wo
be
a
bit
of
fun
stupid
poky
old
chestnut
nobody
wants
to
come
to
buy
things
they
only
come
because
they
think
they
have
to
now
if
we
had
a
play
yes
said
elsie
morris
a
play
would
be
the
very
nicest
thing
brought
two
books
for
us
to
look
over
one
that
shakespeare
thing
and
the
other
is
called
reunion
at
mother
goose
it
awfully
funny
i
think
it
better
than
the
shakespeare
i
think
mother
goose
things
are
silly
said
ethel
holmes
who
wants
to
go
around
dressed
up
like
little
and
say
ba
black
sheep
all
the
time
yes
or
who
wants
to
be
red
riding
hood
wolf
and
eat
up
little
lamb
oh
it
is
like
that
it
a
reunion
you
know
and
all
the
mother
goose
children
are
grown
up
and
they
talk
about
old
times
it
does
sound
nice
said
patty
let
read
it
they
read
both
the
plays
and
so
interested
were
they
in
the
reading
and
discussing
them
that
before
they
knew
it
the
afternoon
slipped
away
and
pansy
potts
came
in
to
announce
that
the
tea
was
ready
goodness
cried
patty
i
forgot
all
about
it
come
on
girls
we
can
discuss
the
play
just
as
well
at
the
table
yes
and
better
said
elsie
such
a
shout
of
exclamation
as
went
up
from
the
tea
club
girls
when
they
saw
patty
table
why
did
you
tell
us
there
was
to
be
a
wedding
said
ethel
and
we
would
have
brought
presents
is
it
an
african
jungle
said
laura
or
is
it
only
smith
flower
store
moved
up
here
bodily
i
think
it
looks
like
a
page
out
of
the
home
said
polly
stevens
you
ought
to
have
this
table
photographed
it
would
take
the
first
prize
but
where
are
we
going
to
eat
surely
you
do
expect
us
to
sit
down
at
this
louis
xlv
gimcrack
nonsense
said
patty
i
fixed
it
up
pretty
because
i
thought
it
would
please
you
if
you
do
like
it
oh
we
like
it
cried
christine
converse
we
love
it
we
want
to
take
it
home
with
us
and
put
it
under
a
glass
case
stop
your
nonsense
girls
said
marian
who
had
noticed
patty
rising
colour
and
take
your
places
it
a
beautiful
party
and
a
lot
too
good
for
such
ungrateful
wretches
if
you
can
read
writing
you
find
your
names
on
your
cards
i
can
read
writing
said
lillian
desmond
but
not
such
elegant
gold
curlycues
as
these
wo
you
please
spell
it
out
for
me
miss
fairfield
oh
take
any
place
you
choose
said
patty
laughing
she
did
really
mind
their
chaff
but
she
began
to
think
herself
that
she
had
been
a
little
absurd
then
pansy
brought
in
the
various
dishes
that
patty
had
worked
so
hard
over
and
perhaps
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
they
were
almost
uneatable
or
at
least
very
far
from
the
dainty
perfection
they
ought
to
have
shown
on
discovering
this
the
girls
who
were
really
in
spite
of
their
love
of
chaffing
quite
changed
their
manner
and
ignoring
the
situation
began
merrily
to
discuss
the
play
but
as
the
various
viands
proved
a
continuous
succession
of
failures
patty
became
really
embarrassed
and
began
to
make
apologies
do
say
a
word
said
marian
it
was
all
my
fault
i
insisted
on
spending
the
day
here
and
i
nearly
bothered
the
life
out
of
my
poor
cousin
indeed
i
carried
her
off
bodily
from
the
kitchen
just
at
a
dozen
critical
moments
no
it
was
that
said
honest
patty
but
i
did
just
what
i
always
doing
trying
to
make
a
lot
of
things
i
do
know
anything
about
well
said
elsie
if
you
could
try
them
on
us
girls
i
do
know
who
you
could
try
them
on
i
more
than
willing
to
be
a
martyr
to
the
cause
and
i
say
three
cheers
for
our
noble
president
the
cheers
were
given
with
a
will
and
patty
equanimity
being
restored
she
was
her
own
merry
self
again
and
they
all
laughed
and
chatted
as
only
a
lot
of
happy
girls
can
and
that
how
it
happened
that
when
fairfield
reached
home
at
about
six
he
heard
what
sounded
like
a
general
pandemonium
in
the
as
he
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
was
greeted
by
a
merry
ovation
for
most
of
the
tea
club
members
knew
and
liked
patty
pleasant
and
genial
father
then
the
girls
realising
how
late
it
was
began
to
take
their
leave
marian
went
with
them
and
patty
after
the
last
one
had
gone
returned
to
the
to
find
her
father
regarding
the
table
with
a
look
of
comical
dismay
it
was
indeed
a
magnificent
ruin
besides
the
dishes
of
almost
untasted
delicacies
the
flowers
had
been
pushed
into
disarray
one
small
vase
had
been
upset
and
broken
owing
to
improper
adjustment
the
candles
had
dripped
pink
wax
on
the
and
the
ice
cream
which
pansy
had
mistakenly
served
on
plates
had
melted
and
run
through
patty
did
say
a
word
indeed
there
was
nothing
to
say
she
went
and
stood
very
close
to
her
father
as
if
expecting
him
to
put
his
arm
around
her
which
he
promptly
did
you
see
he
said
it
would
have
made
any
difference
at
all
not
difference
at
all
that
i
have
brought
my
friend
hepworth
the
artist
home
to
dinner
and
you
see
misled
by
the
experiences
of
last
night
i
promised
him
we
would
find
a
tidy
little
dinner
awaiting
us
oh
papa
cried
patty
i
sorry
if
i
had
only
known
i
have
failed
you
for
worlds
i
know
it
my
girl
and
though
this
lucullus
feast
does
seem
out
of
proportion
to
a
young
misses
tea
club
yet
we
wo
say
a
word
about
that
now
we
just
get
snow
shovels
and
set
to
work
and
clear
this
table
and
let
mancy
get
a
simple
little
dinner
as
quickly
as
she
can
but
papa
and
here
patty
met
what
was
perhaps
so
far
the
hardest
experience
of
her
life
i
forgot
to
order
anything
for
dinner
at
all
why
patty
fairfield
consider
yourself
discharged
and
i
shall
suit
myself
at
once
with
another
housekeeperess
you
are
the
dearest
best
sweetest
father
she
exclaimed
how
can
you
be
so
and
gay
when
my
heart
is
breaking
oh
do
let
your
heart
break
over
such
prosaic
things
as
dinners
we
crawl
out
of
this
hole
somehow
but
what
can
we
do
papa
it
after
six
and
all
the
markets
are
shut
up
and
there
is
a
thing
in
the
house
except
those
horrible
things
i
tried
to
make
patty
said
her
father
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
is
sunday
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
ordered
for
over
sunday
no
i
have
said
patty
aghast
at
the
enormity
of
her
offence
fairfield
laughed
at
the
look
on
his
daughter
face
i
always
thought
you
could
keep
house
he
said
with
an
air
of
resignation
on
monday
i
shall
advertise
for
a
housekeeper
oh
please
do
pleaded
patty
give
me
one
more
trial
i
had
a
good
lesson
and
truly
i
profit
by
it
let
me
try
again
but
you
ca
try
again
before
monday
and
by
that
time
we
all
be
dead
of
starvation
of
course
we
will
said
patty
despairingly
i
wish
we
were
robinson
crusoes
and
could
eat
bark
or
something
well
baby
i
think
you
had
a
pretty
good
lesson
and
we
put
old
heads
on
young
shoulders
all
at
once
so
i
help
you
out
this
time
and
then
the
next
time
you
go
back
on
me
in
this
heartless
fashion
i
discharge
you
papa
you
a
but
what
can
we
do
well
the
first
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
go
and
brush
your
hair
and
make
yourself
tidy
then
come
down
and
meet
hepworth
and
then
all
go
over
to
the
hotel
for
dinner
meanwhile
i
call
in
the
street
cleaning
department
to
attend
to
this
chapter
xiii
a
new
friend
patty
said
her
father
a
week
or
two
later
hepworth
has
invited
us
to
a
tea
in
his
studio
in
new
york
tomorrow
afternoon
and
if
you
care
to
go
i
take
you
yes
i
love
to
go
i
always
wanted
to
go
to
a
studio
tea
it
very
kind
of
hepworth
to
ask
us
after
the
way
he
was
treated
here
fairfield
laughed
but
patty
looked
decidedly
sober
she
still
felt
very
much
crestfallen
to
think
that
the
first
guest
her
father
brought
home
should
be
obliged
to
dine
at
the
hotel
or
at
a
neighbour
aunt
alice
had
invited
them
to
dinner
on
that
memorable
sunday
and
though
she
said
she
had
expected
to
ask
the
fairfields
anyway
still
patty
felt
that
as
a
housekeeper
she
had
been
weighed
in
the
balances
and
found
sadly
wanting
according
to
arrangement
she
met
her
father
in
new
york
the
day
of
the
tea
and
together
they
went
to
hepworth
studio
it
gave
patty
a
very
feeling
to
find
herself
amongst
such
strange
and
unaccustomed
surroundings
the
studio
was
a
large
room
on
the
top
floor
of
a
high
building
it
was
finished
in
dark
wood
and
decorated
with
many
unframed
pictures
and
dusty
casts
bits
of
drapery
were
flung
here
and
there
quaint
chairs
and
couches
were
all
about
and
at
one
side
of
the
room
was
a
raised
platform
a
group
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
sat
in
one
corner
another
group
surrounded
a
punch
bowl
and
many
wise
and
people
were
discussing
the
pictures
and
drawings
patty
was
enchanted
she
had
never
been
in
a
scene
like
this
before
and
the
whole
atmosphere
appealed
to
her
very
strongly
the
guests
though
kind
and
polite
to
her
treated
her
as
a
child
and
patty
was
glad
of
this
for
she
felt
sure
she
never
could
talk
or
understand
the
artistic
jargon
in
which
they
were
conversing
but
she
enjoyed
the
pictures
in
her
own
way
and
was
standing
in
delighted
admiration
before
a
large
marine
which
was
nothing
but
the
varying
blues
of
the
sea
and
sky
when
she
heard
a
pleasant
frank
young
voice
beside
her
say
you
seem
to
like
that
picture
oh
i
do
she
exclaimed
and
turning
saw
a
boy
of
about
nineteen
smiling
at
her
it
is
so
real
she
said
i
never
saw
a
realer
scene
not
even
down
at
sandy
hook
why
you
can
fairly
feel
the
dampness
from
it
yes
i
know
just
what
you
mean
said
the
boy
it
a
jolly
picture
is
it
they
say
it
one
of
hepworth
best
i
do
know
anything
about
pictures
said
patty
frankly
and
so
i
do
like
to
express
definite
opinions
it
always
wiser
not
to
said
the
boy
still
smiling
that
true
said
patty
i
only
did
express
an
opinion
once
this
afternoon
and
then
that
lady
over
there
in
a
gown
looked
at
me
through
her
lorgnette
and
said
oh
i
thought
you
were
temperamental
but
you
only
an
imaginative
realist
now
what
could
she
have
meant
by
that
said
the
boy
laughing
but
you
very
imprudent
how
do
you
know
that
lady
is
my
my
sister
or
cousin
or
something
well
even
if
she
is
said
patty
i
have
said
anything
unkind
have
i
no
more
you
have
but
as
i
do
see
anyone
just
now
at
leisure
to
introduce
us
suppose
we
introduce
ourselves
they
say
the
roof
is
an
introduction
but
i
notice
it
never
pronounces
names
very
distinctly
mine
is
kenneth
harper
and
mine
is
patricia
fairfield
but
i
usually
called
patty
i
should
think
you
would
be
it
suits
you
to
a
dot
of
course
the
boys
call
me
ken
i
a
columbia
student
oh
are
you
said
patty
i
never
known
a
college
boy
and
always
wanted
to
meet
one
well
you
see
in
me
a
noble
specimen
of
my
kind
said
young
harper
straightening
up
his
broad
shoulders
and
looking
distinctly
athletic
you
must
be
said
patty
you
look
just
like
all
the
pictures
of
college
boys
i
ever
seen
and
i
flattered
myself
that
my
beauty
was
something
especial
and
individual
you
ought
to
be
thankful
that
you
beautiful
said
patty
and
not
be
so
particular
about
what
kind
of
beauty
it
is
but
some
kinds
of
beauty
are
not
worth
having
went
on
young
harper
look
at
that
man
over
there
with
a
lean
pale
face
and
long
lank
hair
that
beauty
but
i
must
say
i
prefer
a
strong
brave
manly
type
like
this
chap
just
coming
toward
us
oh
you
do
said
patty
well
as
that
chap
happens
to
be
my
father
i
take
pleasure
in
introducing
you
i
am
glad
to
see
you
sir
said
kenneth
harper
as
patty
presented
him
to
her
father
and
i
may
as
well
own
up
that
i
was
just
making
remarks
on
your
personal
appearance
which
accounts
for
my
blushing
embarrassment
i
wo
inquire
what
they
were
said
fairfield
lest
i
too
should
become
embarrassed
but
patty
my
girl
if
we
going
back
to
vernondale
on
the
train
it
time
we
were
starting
oh
do
you
live
in
vernondale
inquired
kenneth
i
have
an
aunt
there
i
wonder
if
you
know
her
her
name
is
daggett
miss
rachel
daggett
indeed
i
do
know
her
said
patty
she
is
my
neighbour
is
she
really
how
jolly
and
do
you
think
she
an
old
dear
awfully
fond
of
her
i
run
out
to
see
her
every
chance
i
can
get
though
i
have
been
much
this
winter
i
been
digging
so
hard
she
a
dear
said
patty
i
only
seen
her
once
but
i
know
i
shall
like
her
as
a
neighbour
yes
i
sure
you
will
but
let
me
give
you
a
bit
of
confidential
advice
do
take
the
initiative
let
her
do
that
and
the
game
will
be
far
more
successful
than
if
make
the
overtures
patty
smiled
miss
daggett
told
me
that
herself
she
said
in
fact
she
was
quite
emphatic
on
the
subject
i
can
well
believe
it
said
kenneth
but
i
sure
you
win
her
heart
yet
i
sure
she
will
too
said
fairfield
with
an
approving
glance
at
his
pretty
daughter
and
whenever
you
are
in
vernondale
harper
i
hope
you
will
come
to
see
us
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
answered
the
young
man
and
i
hope
to
run
out
there
soon
come
out
when
we
have
our
play
said
patty
it
going
to
be
beautiful
what
play
is
that
we
do
know
yet
we
have
decided
on
it
i
know
an
awfully
good
play
one
of
the
fellows
up
at
college
wrote
it
and
so
it
is
hackneyed
yet

patty
papa

for

papa
said
patty
or
she
get
out
all
the
and
drag
the
river
for
us
so
she
will
said
fairfield
i
set
her
mind
at
rest
the
first
thing
that
our
cook
explained
patty
it
a
lovely
name
observed
kenneth
but
just
a
bit
lengthy
for
use
oh
it
only
for
sundays
and
holidays
said
patty
other
days
we
contract
it
to
mancy
seated
at
table
in
a
bright
and
beautiful
restaurant
patty
and
her
new
friend
began
to
chatter
like
magpies
while
fairfield
ordered
dinner
now
tell
me
all
about
your
friend
play
said
patty
for
i
feel
sure
it
going
to
be
just
what
we
want
well
the
scene
said
kenneth
is
on
mount
olympus
and
the
characters
are
all
the
gods
and
goddesses
you
know
but
they
brought
up
to
date
in
fact
that
the
name
of
the
play
olympus
up
to
date
aurora
you
know
has
an
automobile
instead
of
her
car
but
you
do
have
the
automobile
on
the
stage
oh

aurora
just
comes
in
in
her
automobile
rig
and
talks
about
her
mercury
has
a
bicycle
he
a
trick
rider
and
does
all
sorts
of
stunts
and
venus
is
a
summer
girl
dressed

a
stunning

and
a
paris
hat
and
hercules

a

make
himself
stronger
you
know
and
niobe
has
quantities
of
handkerchiefs
dozens
and
dozens
of
them
she
an
awfully
funny
character
oh
i
think
it
would
be
lovely
said
patty
where
can
we
get
the
book
i
send
you
one
and
you
can
see
if
you
like
it
and
then
if

kenneth
modestly
i
wish

play

ahead
rather
fast
patty
child
said
her
father
your
club
has
decided
to
use
this
play
yet
i
know
it
papa
and
of
course
i
mean
if
we
use
it
but
anyway
president
of
the
club
and
somehow
if
i
want
a
thing
the
rest
of
the
girls
generally
seem
to
want
it
too
that
a
fine
condition
of
affairs
that
any
president
might
be
glad
to
bring
about
you
ought
to
be
a
college
president
perhaps
i
shall
be
some
day
said
patty
the
dinner
hour
flew
by
all
too
quickly
patty
greatly
enjoyed
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
brilliant
crowded
room
she
loved
the
lights
and
the
music
the
flowers
and
the
palms
and
the
throngs
of
gaily
dressed
people
kenneth
harper
enjoyed
it
too
and
thought
he
had
rarely
met
such
attractive
people
as
the
fairfields
when
he
took
his
leave
he
thanked
fairfield
courteously
for
his
pleasant
evening
and
promised
soon
to
call
upon
them
at
boxley
hall
they
reached
home
by
a
late
train
and
patty
went
up
to
her
pretty
bedroom
with
her
usual
happy
conviction
that
she
was
a
very
fortunate
little
girl
and
had
the
best
father
in
the
world
chapter
xiv
the
neighbour
again
kenneth
harper
did
send
the
book
and
as
patty
confidently
expected
the
girls
of
the
club
quite
agreed
with
her
that
it
was
the
best
play
for
them
to
use
at
a
meeting
at
marian
plans
were
made
and
parts
were
chosen
the
goddesses
were
allotted
to
the
members
of
the
club
and
the
gods
were
distributed
among
their
brothers
and
friends
guy
morris
being
of
gigantic
mould
was
cast
for
hercules
and
frank
elliott
for
ajax
when
patty
told
the
girls
that
kenneth
harper
could
do
trick
riding
on
a
bicycle
they
unanimously
voted
to
invite
him
to
take
part
in
their
entertainment
it
was
decided
to
have
the
play
about
the
middle
of
february
and
the
whole
tea
club
grew
enthusiastic
over
the
plans
for
the
wonderful
performance
one
morning
patty
sat
in
the
library
studying
her
part
she
was
very
happy
of
course
patty
always
was
happy
but
this
morning
she
was
unusually
so
her
housekeeping
was
going
on
smoothly
the
night
before
her
father
had
expressed
himself
as
being
greatly
pleased
with
the
system
and
order
which
seemed
everywhere
noticeable
in
the
house
it
was
saturday
morning
and
she
did
have
to
go
to
school
moreover
she
was
very
much
interested
in
the
play
and
in
her
own
part
in
it
and
had
already
planned
a
most
beautiful
gown
which
the
dressmaker
madame
lafayette
was
to
make
for
her
patty
part
in
the
play
was
that
of
diana
and
her
costume
was
to
be
a
beautiful
one
of
hunter
green
cloth
with
russet
leather
leggings
and
a
jaunty
cap
being
instead
of
being
a
huntress
she
was
to
represent
an
agent
of
the
this
suited
patty
exactly
for
she
had
a
horror
of
killing
live
things
and
very
much
preferred
doing
all
she
could
to
prevent
such
slaughter
moreover
the
humour
of
the
thing
appealed
to
her
and
the
funny
effect
of
the
huntress
diana
going
around
distributing
leaflets
and
begging
her
not
to
shoot
seemed
to
patty
very
humourous
and
attractive
this
saturday
then
she
had
settled
down
in
the
library
to
study
her
lines
all
through
the
long
cosey
morning
when
to
her
annoyance
the
doorbell
rang
i
hope
it
none
of
the
girls
she
thought
i
did
want
this
morning
to
myself
it
was
any
of
the
girls
but
pansy
announced
that
a
messenger
had
come
from
miss
daggett
and
that
miss
daggett
wished
miss
fairfield
to
return
her
call
at
once
patty
smiled
at
the
unusual
message
but
groaned
at
the
thought
of
her
interrupted
holiday
however
miss
daggett
was
not
one
to
be
ignored
or
lightly
set
aside
so
patty
put
on
her
things
and
started
although
miss
daggett
house
was
next
door
to
boxley
hall
yet
it
was
set
in
the
middle
of
such
a
large
lot
and
was
so
far
back
from
the
street
and
so
surrounded
by
tall
thick
trees
that
patty
had
never
had
a
really
good
view
of
it
she
was
surprised
therefore
to
find
it
a
very
large
stone
house
with
broad
veranda
and
steps
guarded
by
two
stone
lions
patty
rang
the
bell
and
the
door
was
opened
very
slightly
a
small
old
coloured
man
peeped
out
go
he
said
go
at
once
we
do
want
no
tickets
i
not
selling
tickets
said
patty
half
angry
and
half
amused
well
we
do
want
no
shoelacers
nor
lead
pencils
nor
nuffin
you
be
selling
something
i
am
not
selling
anything
said
patty
i
came
over
because
miss
daggett
sent
for
me
laws
massy
child
why
did
you
say
so
before
you
spoke
be
you
miss
fairfield
yes
said
patty
here
my
card
oh
never
mind
the
ticket
if
so
be
you
miss
fairfield
jes
come
right
in
come
right
in
the
door
was
flung
open
wide
and
patty
entered
a
dark
hall
from
that
she
was
led
into
a
parlour
so
dark
that
she
could
scarcely
see
the
outline
of
a
lady
on
the
sofa
how
do
you
do
miss
daggett
she
said
guessing
that
it
was
probably
her
hostess
who
seemed
to
be
sitting
there
how
do
you
do
said
miss
daggett
putting
out
her
hand
without
rising
i
quite
well
thank
you
said
patty
and
her
eyes
having
grown
a
little
accustomed
to
the
dark
she
grasped
the
old
lady
hand
although
as
she
told
her
father
afterwards
she
was
awfully
afraid
she
would
tweak
her
nose
by
mistake
and
how
are
you
miss
daggett
not
very
well
child
not
very
well
but
you
wo
stay
long
will
you
i
sent
for
you
yes
i
sent
for
you
on
an
impulse
i
thought
i
like
to
see
you
but
i
no
sooner
sent
than
i
wished
i
had
but
you

your
toes

patty
not
wishing

any
rash
promises

big
house

all
alone
by

i
keeping

alone
by
myself
my
father
there
and
two
servants
do
you
keep
a
man
no
a
man

every
day
to
do
the
hard
work
but
he

humph
i
suppose
you
think
you
pretty
smart
do
you
i
do
know
said
patty
slowly
as
if
considering
yes
i
think
pretty
smart
in
some
ways
and
in
other
ways
i
as
stupid
as
an
owl
well
you
must
be
pretty
smart
because
you
have
had
to
borrow
anything
over
here
yet
but
i
would
borrow
anything
here
anyway
miss
daggett
you
specially
asked
me
not
to
miss
daggett
old
wrinkled
face
broke
into
a
smile
and
so
you
remember
that
well
well
you
are
a
nice
little
girl
you
must
have
had
a
good
mother
and
a
good
my
mother
died
when
i
was
three
and
my
father
brought
me
up
he
did
hey
well
he
made
a
fairly
good
job
of
it
now
i
guess
you
can
go
i
about
tired
of
talking
to
you
then
i
will
go
but
first
miss
daggett
let
me
tell
you
that
i
met
your
nephew
the
other
day
kenneth
for
the
land
sake
well
well
sit
down
again
i
do
want
you
to
go
yet
tell
me
all
about
him
is
he
a
nice
boy
has
he
fine
eyes
and
gentlemanly
manners
and
oh
the
lovely
ways
with
him
yes
miss
daggett
he
is
indeed
a
nice
boy
my
father
and
i
both
think
so
his
eyes
and
his
manners
are
fine
he
says
he
wants
to
come
out
to
see
you
soon
bless
his
heart
i
hope
he
come
i
do
hope
he
come
then
you
like
to
have
him
come
to
see
you
said
patty
a
little
roguishly
yes
and
i
like
to
have
you
too
land
child
you
must
mind
my
quick
ways
i
do
mind
how
quick
you
are
said
patty
but
when
you
tell
me
to
be
sure
and
not
come
to
see
you
of
course
i
do
come
oh
that
all
right
said
miss
daggett
that
all
right
i
always
send
for
you
when
i
want
you
but
perhaps
i
ca
always
come
said
patty
i
may
be
busy
with
my
housekeeping
now
would
that
be
annoying
said
miss
daggett
i
declare
that
would
be
just
my
luck
i
always
do
have
bad
luck
perhaps
it
the
way
you
look
at
it
said
patty
now
i
have
some
things
that
seem
like
bad
luck
at
least
other
people
think
they
do
but
if
i
look
at
them
right
happy
and
cheerful
you
know
why
they
just
seem
like
good
luck
really
said
miss
daggett
with
a
curious
smile
well
now
you
a
queer
child
and
i
not
at
all
sure
but
i
like
to
have
you
come
again
do
you
want
to
see
around
my
house
i
like
to
very
much
but
it
so
dark
a
bat
could
see
things
in
this
room
but
i
ca
open
the
shades
the
sun
would
fade
all
the
furniture
coverings
well
then
you
could
buy
new
ones
said
patty
that
would
be
better
than
living
in
the
dark
dark
ca
hurt
anybody
said
miss
daggett
gloomily
oh
indeed
it
can
said
patty
earnestly
why
darkness
i
mean
darkness
in
the
daytime
makes
you
all
stewed
up
and
fidgety
and
horrid
and
sunshine
makes
you
all
gay
and
cheerful
and
glad
like
you
said
miss
daggett
yes
like
me
said
patty
i
am
cheerful
and
glad
always
i
like
to
be
i
would
like
to
be
too
said
miss
daggett
do
you
suppose
if
i
opened
the
shutters
i
would
be
let
try
it
and
see
said
patty
and
running
to
the
windows
she
flung
open
the
inside
blinds
and
flooded
the
room
with
sunshine
oh
what
a
beautiful
room
she
exclaimed
as
she
turned
around
why
miss
daggett
to
think
of
keeping
all
these
lovely
things
shut
up
in
the
dark
i
believe
they
cry
about
it
when
you
are
looking
already
the
old
lady
face
seemed
to
show
a
gentler
and
sunnier
expression
and
she
said
yes
i
have
some
beautiful
things
child
would
you
like
to
look
through
this
cabinet
of
east
indian
curiosities
i
would
very
much
said
patty
but
i
fear
i
ca
take
the
time
this
morning
i
have
to
study
my
part
in
a
play
we
going
to
give
it
a
play
your
nephew
told
us
about
she
added
quickly
feeling
sure
that
this
would
rouse
the
old
lady
interest
in
it
one
of
kenneth
college
plays
she
said
eagerly
yes
that
just
what
it
is
a
chum
of
his
wrote
it
and
oh
miss
daggett
we
going
to
invite
harper
to
come
to
vernondale
the
night
of
the
play
and
take
the
same
part
that
he
took
at
college
last
year
you
see
he
know
it
and
he
can
just
step
right
in
good
for
you
i
hope
he
come
i
write
at
once
and
tell
him
how
much
i
want
him
he
can
stay
here
of
course
and
perhaps
he
can
come
sooner
so
as
to
be
here
for
one
or
two
rehearsals
that
would
be
a
good
help
i
hope
he
will
do
that
he
could
coach
the
rest
of
us
i
do
know
just
what
coach
means
but
i
sure
kenneth
can
do
it
a
very
clever
boy
he
says
he
can
run
an
automobile
but
i
do
believe
it
run
away
home
now
child
i
tired
of
having
company
and
besides
i
want
to
compose
my
mind
so
i
can
write
a
letter
to
kenneth
and
will
you
leave
your
blinds
open
till
afternoon
said
patty
who
was
beginning
to
learn
her
queer
old
neighbour
yes
i
will
if
i
do
forget
it
clear
out
child
clear
out
now
run
away
home
and
mind
you
not
to
borrow
anything
and
you
not
to
come
back
till
i
send
for
you
all
right
said
patty
and
mind
you
to
keep
bright
and
cheerful
and
let
the
sunlight
in
all
the
time
chapter
xv
bills
patty
plans
for
systematic
housekeeping
included
a
number
of
small
account
books
and
she
looked
forward
with
some
eagerness
to
the
time
when
the
first
month
bills
should
come
in
and
she
could
present
to
her
father
a
neat
and
accurate
statement
of
the
household
expenses
for
the
month
the
of
february
was
sunday
but
on
monday
morning
the
postman
brought
a
sheaf
of
letters
which
were
evidently
bills
patty
had
no
time
to
look
at
these
before
she
went
to
school
so
she
placed
them
carefully
in
her
desk
determined
to
hurry
home
that
afternoon
and
get
her
accounts
into
order
before
her
father
came
home
after
school
she
returned
to
find
a
supplementary
lot
of
bills
had
been
left
by
the
postman
and
also
mancy
presented
her
with
a
number
of
bills
which
the
tradesmen
had
left
that
morning
patty
took
the
whole
lot
to
her
desk
and
with
methodical
exactness
noted
the
amounts
on
the
pages
of
her
little
books
she
and
her
father
had
talked
the
matter
over
more
or
less
and
patty
knew
just
about
what
fairfield
expected
the
bills
to
amount
to
but
to
her
consternation
she
discovered
as
she
went
along
that
each
bill
was
proving
to
be
about
twice
as
large
as
she
had
anticipated
there
must
be
some
mistake
she
said
to
herself
we
simply
have
eaten
all
those
groceries
anybody
would
think
we
ran
a
branch
store
and
that
butcher
bill
is
big
enough
for
the
central
park
menagerie
they
must
have
added
it
wrong
but
a
careful
verification
of
the
figures
proved
that
they
were
added
right
and
patty
heart
began
to
sink
as
she
looked
at
the
enormous
to
think
of
all
that
for
flowers
well
papa
bought
some
of
them
a
comfort
but
i
had
no
idea
i
had
ordered
so
many
myself
i
think
bills
are
perfectly
horrid
and
here
my
dressmaker
bill
gracious
how
madame
lafayette
has
gone
up
in
her
prices
i
believe
i
make
my
own
clothes
after
this
but
the
market
bills
are
the
worst
i
do
see
how
we
have
eaten
all
these
things
mancy
must
be
a
dreadful
waster
but
it
is
fair
to
blame
her
if
that
where
the
trouble
is
i
ought
to
have
looked
after
it
myself
hello
marian
is
that
you
i
did
hear
you
come
in
do
come
here
i
in
the
depths
of
despair
what
the
matter
patsie
and
what
a
furious
lot
of
bills
you
look
like
a
clearinghouse
oh
marian
it
perfectly
fearful
every
bill
is
two
or
three
times
as
much
as
i
thought
it
would
be
and
i
so
sorry
for
i
meant
to
be
such
a
thrifty
housekeeper
jiminetty
christmas
exclaimed
marian
looking
at
some
of
the
papers
i
should
think
these
bills
big
why
that
more
than
we
pay
a
month
for
groceries
and
look
at
the
size
of
our
family
i
know
it
said
patty
hopelessly
i
do
see
how
it
happened
you
are
an
extravagant
little
wretch
patty
there
no
doubt
about
it
i
suppose
i
am
at
least
i
suppose
i
have
been
but
i
not
going
to
be
any
more
i
going
to
reform
suddenly
and
all
at
once
and
very
thoroughly
now
you
watch
me
we
not
going
to
have
any
more
fancy
things
no
more
ice
cream
from
pacetti
why
that
caterer
bill
is
something
fearful
and
so
you
going
to
starve
poor
uncle
fred
no
that
would
be
fair
would
it
the
economy
ought
to
fall
entirely
on
me
well
i
decided
to
make
my
own
clothes
after
this
anyway
oh
patty
what
a
goose
you
are
you
could
make
them
to
save
your
neck
and
after
you
made
them
you
could
wear
them
i
could
too
marian
elliott
just
you
wait
and
see
me
make
my
summer
dresses
i
going
to
sew
all
through
vacation
all
right
said
marian
i
come
over
and
help
you
but
you
make
any
dresses
this
afternoon
so
put
away
those
old
bills
and
get
ready
for
a
sleigh
ride
it
lovely
out
and
father
said
he
call
for
us
here
at
four
all
right
i
will
if
we
can
get
back
by
six
i
want
to
be
here
when
papa
comes
home
yes
we
be
back
by
six
i
expect
uncle
fred
will
shut
you
up
in
a
dark
room
and
keep
you
on
bread
and
water
for
a
week
when
he
sees
those
bills
that
just
the
worst
of
it
said
patty
forlornly
he
so
good
and
kind
and
spoils
me
so
dreadfully
that
it
makes
me
feel
all
the
worse
when
i
do
do
things
right
a
good
long
sleigh
ride
in
the
fresh
crisp
winter
air
quite
revived
patty
despondent
spirits
she
sat
in
front
with
uncle
charley
and
he
let
her
drive
part
of
the
way
for
it
was
patty
great
delight
to
drive
two
horses
and
she
had
already
become
a
fairly
accomplished
little
horsewoman
fred
tells
me
he
going
to
get
horses
for
you
this
spring
said
uncle
charley
you
enjoy
them
a
lot
wo
you
patty
yes
indeed
that
is
i
do
know
whether
we
have
them
or
not
for
it
just
occurred
to
patty
that
having
run
her
father
into
such
unexpected
expense
in
the
household
a
good
way
to
economise
would
be
to
give
up
all
hopes
of
horses
oh
yes
you
have
them
all
right
said
uncle
charley
in
his
gay
cheery
way
having
no
idea
of
course
what
was
in
patty
mind
and
you
must
have
a
little
pony
and
cart
of
your
own
it
would
give
you
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
to
go
out
driving
in
the
spring
weather
i
just
guess
it
would
said
patty
and
i
sure
i
hope
i
have
it
she
began
to
wonder
if
she
could
find
some
other
way
to
economise
rather
than
on
the
horses
for
she
certainly
did
love
to
drive
promptly
at
six
uncle
charley
left
her
at
boxley
hall
and
as
she
entered
the
door
patty
felt
that
strange
sinking
of
the
heart
that
always
accompanies
the
resuming
of
a
mental
burden
i
know
just
how
thieves
and
defaulters
and
forgers
feel
she
said
to
herself
as
she
took
off
her
wraps
i
have
exactly
stolen
but
betrayed
a
trust
and
that
just
as
bad
i
wonder
what
papa
will
say
at
dinner
patty
was
subdued
and
a
little
nervous
fairfield
quick
to
notice
anything
unusual
in
his
daughter
surmised
that
she
was
bothered
but
felt
sure
that
in
her
own
time
she
would
tell
him
all
about
it
so
he
endeavoured
to
set
her
at
her
ease
by
chatting
pleasantly
about
the
events
of
his
day
in
the
city
and
sustaining
the
burden
of
the
conversation
himself
but
after
dinner
when
they
had
gone
into
the
library
as
they
usually
did
in
the
evening
patty
brought
out
her
fearful
array
of
paper
bugbears
and
laid
them
before
her
father
what
are
these
said
fairfield
cheerily
ah
yes
i
see
the
of
the
month
has
brought
its
usual
crop
of
bills
i
do
hope
it
is
the
usual
crop
papa
for
if
they
always
come
in
like
this
we
have
to
give
up
boxley
hall
and
go
to
live
in
the
oh
i
do
know
we
have
overdrawn
our
bank
account
yet
whew
pacetti
is
a
stunner
is
it
yes
said
patty
in
a
meek
little
voice
and
fisher
seem
to
have
summed
up
quite
a
total
and
flower
bill
looks
like
a
good
old
summer
time
oh
papa
please
scold
me
i
know
i
deserve
it
i
ought
to
have
looked
after
these
things
and
kept
the
expenses
down
more
why
ought
you
to
have
done
so
patty
we
have
to
have
food
do
we
yes
but
papa
you
know
we
estimated
in
the
beginning
and
these
old
bills
come
up
to
about
twice
as
much
as
our
estimate
that
a
fact
baby
they
do
said
fairfield
looking
over
the
statements
with
a
more
serious
air
these
are
pretty
big
figures
to
represent
a
month
living
for
just
you
and
me
and
our
small
retinue
of
servants
yes
and
papa
i
think
mancy
is
rather
wasteful
i
do
say
this
to
blame
her
i
know
it
is
my
place
to
see
about
it
and
be
careful
that
she
utilises
all
that
is
possible
of
the
kitchen
waste
patty
said
this
so
exactly
with
the
air
of
a
housekeeper
or
school
that
fairfield
laughed
outright
chickadee
he
said
you
come
out
all
right
you
have
the
true
elements
of
success
you
see
where
you
fallen
into
error
willing
to
admit
it
and
you
ready
to
use
every
means
to
improve
in
the
future
i
not
quite
so
surprised
as
you
are
at
the
size
of
these
bills
for
though
we
made
our
estimates
rationally
yet
we
have
been
buying
a
great
many
things
and
having
a
pretty
good
time
generally
i
foresaw
this
experience
at
the
end
of
the
month
but
i
preferred
to
wait
and
see
how
we
came
out
rather
than
interfere
with
the
proceedings
and
another
thing
patty
which
may
comfort
you
some
is
the
fact
that
i
quite
believe
that
some
of
these
tradespeople
have
taken
advantage
of
your
youth
and
inexperience
and
padded
their
bills
a
little
bit
in
consequence
but
papa
just
look
at
madame
lafayette
bill
i
do
think
she
ought
to
charge
so
much
these
do
seem
high
prices
for
the
simple
little
frocks
you
wear
but
they
are
always
so
daintily
made
and
in
such
good
taste
that
i
think
we
have
to
continue
to
employ
her
dressmakers
you
know
are
acknowledged
vampires
i
like
the
clothes
she
makes
too
said
patty
but
i
had
concluded
that
that
was
the
best
way
for
me
to
economise
and
i
thought
after
this
i
would
make
my
own
dresses
i
do
think
you
will
my
child
said
fairfield
decidedly
you
could
make
dresses
fit
to
be
seen
unless
you
took
a
course
of
instruction
in
dressmaking
and
i
not
sure
that
you
could
then
and
you
have
quite
enough
to
do
with
your
school
work
and
your
practising
when
did
you
propose
to
do
this
wonderful
sewing
oh
i
mean
in
vacation
to
make
my
summer
dresses
no
in
vacation
you
to
run
out
of
doors
and
play
do
let
me
hear
any
more
about
sewing
all
right
said
patty
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
awfully
glad
not
to
but
i
wanted
to
help
somehow
i
thought
i
make
my
green
cloth
costume
for
diana
in
the
play
yes
that
would
be
a
good
thing
to
begin
on
said
fairfield
broadcloth
is
so
tractable
so
easy
to
fit
and
that
effect
can
of
course
be
attained
by
any
beginner
patty
laughed
i
know
it
would
look
horrid
papa
she
said
but
as
i
am
to
blame
for
all
this
outrageous
extravagance
i
want
to
economise
somewhere
to
make
up
for
it
and
do
you
call
it
good
proportion
to
buy
a
great
deal
too
much
to
eat
and
then
go
around
in
botchy
clothes
to
make
up
for
it
no
said
patty
i
do
believe
it
is
what
can
i
do
i
want
to
do
something
and
i
do
oh
papa
i
want
to
give
up
those
horses
that
you
said
you
buy
well
we
fix
it
up
this
way
patty
girl
we
just
pay
off
all
these
bills
and
start
fresh
the
extra
expense
we
charge
to
experience
account
experience
is
an
awfully
commodity
you
know
and
next
month
while
we
wo
exactly
scrimp
ourselves
we
keep
our
eye
on
the
accounts
and
watch
them
as
they
progress
as
i
told
you
before
my
darling
i
do
expect
you
to
become
perfect
or
even
proficient
in
these
things
all
at
once
you
will
need
years
of
experience
before
the
time
can
come
when
your
domestic
machinery
will
run
without
a
flaw
if
indeed
it
ever
does
now
never
think
of
these
january
bills
again
they
are
things
of
the
past
go
and
get
your
and
let
me
hear
you
speak
your
piece
chapter
xvi
a
successful
play
hepworth
came
again
to
visit
boxley
hall
and
while
there
heard
about
the
play
and
became
so
interested
in
the
preparations
that
he
offered
to
paint
some
scenery
for
it
patty
jumped
for
joy
at
this
for
the
scenery
had
been
their
greatest
and
so
the
saturday
morning
before
the
performance
the
renowned
new
york
artist
egerton
hepworth
walked
over
to
library
hall
escorted
by
a
dozen
merry
young
people
of
both
sexes
as
a
scenic
artist
hepworth
proved
a
great
success
and
a
rapid
workman
beside
for
by
he
had
completed
the
one
scene
that
was
necessary
a
view
of
mount
olympus
as
supposed
to
be
at
the
present
date
though
the
actual
work
was
sketchily
done
yet
the
general
effect
was
that
of
a
beautiful
grecian
grove
with
marble
temple
and
steps
and
surrounding
trees
and
flowers
the
whole
of
which
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
an
island
set
in
a
sea
of
blue
sky
and
fleecy
clouds
at
least
that
is
the
way
elsie
morris
declared
it
looked
and
though
hepworth
confessed
that
that
was
not
the
idea
he
had
intended
to
convey
yet
if
they
were
satisfied
he
was
the
young
people
declared
themselves
more
than
satisfied
and
urged
hepworth
so
heartily
to
attend
the
performance
offering
him
the
choicest
seats
in
the
house
and
as
many
as
he
wanted
that
he
finally
consented
to
come
if
he
could
persuade
his
friends
at
boxley
hall
to
put
him
up
for
the
night
patty
demurely
promised
to
try
her
best
to
coax
her
father
to
agree
to
this
arrangement
and
though
she
said
she
had
little
hope
of
succeeding
hepworth
seemed
willing
to
take
his
chances
at
last
the
great
day
arrived
and
patty
rose
early
that
morning
for
there
were
many
last
things
to
be
attended
to
and
being
a
capable
little
manager
it
somehow
devolved
on
patty
to
see
that
all
the
loose
ends
were
gathered
up
and
all
the
minor
matters
looked
after
kenneth
harper
had
been
down
twice
to
rehearsals
and
had
already
become
a
favourite
with
the
vernondale
young
people
indeed
the
cheery
willing
capable
young
man
could
help
getting
himself
liked
wherever
he
went
he
stayed
with
his
aunt
miss
daggett
when
in
vernondale
which
greatly
delighted
the
heart
of
the
old
lady
the
play
was
to
be
on
friday
night
because
then
there
would
be
no
school
next
day
and
friday
morning
patty
was
as
busy
as
a
bee
sorting
tickets
counting
out
programmes
making
lists
and
checking
off
memoranda
when
pansy
appeared
at
her
door
with
the
unwelcome
announcement
that
miss
daggett
had
sent
word
she
would
like
to
have
patty
call
on
her
unwelcome
only
because
patty
was
so
busy
otherwise
she
would
have
been
glad
of
a
summons
to
the
house
for
she
had
taken
a
decided
fancy
to
her
erratic
neighbour
determining
she
would
return
quickly
and
smiling
to
herself
as
she
thought
that
probably
she
would
be
asked
to
do
so
she
ran
over
to
miss
daggett
come
in
child
come
in
called
the
old
lady
from
the
upper
hall
come
right
up
here
i
in
a
terrible
quandary
patty
went
upstairs
and
then
followed
miss
daggett
into
her
bedroom
i
decided
said
the
old
lady
with
the
air
of
one
announcing
a
decision
the
importance
of
which
would
shake
at
least
two
continents
i
decided
to
go
to
that
ridiculous
show
of
yours
oh
have
you
said
patty
that
very
nice
i
sure
i
glad
you
pleased
said
the
old
lady
grimly
though
i
not
going
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
you
are
you
going
to
please
your
nephew
mr
harper
said
patty
not
being
exactly
curious
but
feeling
that
she
was
expected
to
inquire
no
i
not
said
miss
daggett
curtly
i
going
to
please
myself
and
i
called
you
over
here
to
advise
me
what
to
wear
here
are
all
my
best
dresses
but
there
none
of
them
made
in
the
fashions
people
wear
nowadays
and
it
too
late
to
have
them
fixed
over
i
wish
you
tell
me
which
one
you
think
comes
nearest
to
being
right
patty
looked
in
amazement
at
the
great
heap
of
beautiful
gowns
that
lay
upon
the
bed
they
were
made
of
the
richest
velvets
and
satins
and
laces
but
were
all
of
such
an
antiquated
mode
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
advise
anyone
to
wear
them
without
remodeling
but
as
miss
daggett
was
very
much
in
earnest
patty
concluded
that
she
must
necessarily
make
some
choice
accordingly
she
picked
out
a
lavender
moiré
silk
trimmed
with
soft
white
lace
at
the
throat
and
wrist
although
it
was
plain
and
very
simply
made
and
would
patty
thought
be
less
conspicuous
than
the
more
elaborate
gowns
that
just
the
one
i
had
decided
on
myself
said
miss
daggett
and
i
should
have
worn
that
anyway
whatever
you
had
said
then
why
did
you
call
me
over
said
patty
moved
to
impatience
by
this
inconsistency
oh
because
i
wanted
your
opinion
and
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
some
other
things
kenneth
is
coming
you
know
yes
i
know
it
said
patty
and
i
am
very
glad
this
frank
statement
and
the
clear
unembarrassed
light
in
patty
eyes
seemed
to
please
miss
daggett
and
she
kissed
the
pretty
face
upturned
to
hers
but
she
only
said
run
along
now
child
go
home
i
do
want
company
now
i
glad
of
it
patty
thought
to
herself
but
she
only
said
then
miss
daggett
i
see
you
this
evening
wait
a
minute
child
come
back
here
i
not
through
with
you
yet
patty
groaned
in
spirit
but
went
back
with
a
smiling
face
miss
daggett
regarded
her
steadily
you
pretty
busy
i
suppose
she
said
getting
ready
for
your
play
yes
i
am
said
patty
frankly
and
you
did
want
to
take
the
time
to
come
over
here
to
see
me
did
you
oh
i
shall
have
time
enough
to
do
all
i
want
to
do
said
patty
do
evade
my
question
child
you
did
want
to
come
did
you
well
miss
daggett
said
patty
you
are
often
quite
frank
with
me
so
now
i
be
frank
with
you
and
confess
that
when
your
message
came
i
did
wish
you
had
chosen
some
other
day
to
send
for
me
for
i
certainly
have
a
lot
of
little
things
to
do
but
i
shall
get
them
all
done
i
know
and
i
am
very
glad
to
learn
that
you
are
coming
to
the
entertainment
you
are
a
good
girl
said
miss
daggett
you
are
a
good
girl
and
i
like
you
very
much
said
patty
and
she
ran
downstairs
and
over
home
determined
to
work
fast
enough
to
make
up
for
the
time
she
had
lost
she
succeeded
in
this
and
when
her
father
came
home
at
night
bringing
hepworth
with
him
they
found
a
very
charming
little
hostess
awaiting
them
and
boxley
hall
imbued
throughout
with
an
air
of
comfortable
hospitality
after
dinner
patty
donned
her
diana
costume
and
came
down
to
ask
her
father
opinion
of
it
he
declared
it
was
most
jaunty
and
becoming
and
hepworth
said
it
was
especially
well
adapted
to
patty
style
and
that
he
would
like
to
paint
her
portrait
in
that
garb
this
seemed
to
fairfield
a
good
idea
and
they
at
once
made
arrangements
for
future
sittings
patty
was
greatly
pleased
wo
it
be
fine
papa
she
said
it
will
be
an
ancestral
portrait
to
hang
in
boxley
hall
and
keep
till
i
an
old
lady
like
miss
daggett
when
they
reached
library
hall
where
the
play
was
to
be
given
patty
going
in
at
the
stage
entrance
was
met
by
a
crowd
of
excited
girls
who
announced
that
florence
douglass
had
gone
all
to
pieces
what
do
you
mean
cried
patty
what
the
matter
with
her
oh
hysterics
said
elsie
morris
in
great
disgust
first
she
giggles
and
then
she
bursts
into
tears
and
nobody
can
do
anything
with
her
well
she
going
to
be
niobe
anyway
said
patty
so
let
her
go
on
the
stage
and
cut
up
those
tricks
and
the
audience
will
think
all
right
oh
no
patty
we
ca
let
her
go
on
the
stage
said
frank
elliott
she
queer
the
whole
show
well
then
we
have
to
leave
that
part
out
said
patty
oh
dear
wailed
elsie
that
the
funniest
part
of
all
i
hate
to
leave
that
part
out
i
know
it
said
patty
and
florence
does
it
so
well
i
wish
behave
herself
well
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
to
do
but
omit
it
i
might
ask
papa
he
can
think
of
things
when
nobody
else
can
that
so
said
marian
uncle
fred
has
a
positive
genius
for
suggestion
i
step
down
in
the
audience
and
ask
him
said
frank
in
five
minutes
frank
was
back
again
broadly
smiling
and
hepworth
was
with
him
it
all
right
said
frank
i
knew
uncle
fred
would
fix
it
all
he
said
was
you
a
born
actor
take
the
part
yourself
and
hepworth
like
the
brick
he
is
said
he
do
it
i
fairly
jumped
at
the
chance
said
the
young
artist
smiling
down
into
patty
bright
face
i
was
dying
to
be
in
this
thing
anyway
and
they
tell
me
the
costume
is
nothing
but
several
hundred
yards
of
greek
draperies
so
i
think
it
will
fit
me
all
right
but
you
do
know
the
lines
said
patty
delighted
at
this
solution
of
the
dilemma
but
unable
to
see
how
it
could
be
accomplished
oh
that
all
right
said
hepworth
merrily
i
shall
make
up
my
lines
as
i
go
along
and
when
i
see
that
anyone
else
wants
to
talk
i
shall
stop
and
give
them
a
chance
it
sounded
a
little
precarious
but
as
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
florence
douglass
begged
them
to
put
somebody
anybody
in
her
place
and
let
her
go
home
they
all
agreed
to
avail
themselves
of
hepworth
services
and
it
was
fortunate
they
did
for
though
the
rest
of
the
characters
were
bright
and
clever
representations
yet
it
was
hepworth
funny
impromptu
jokes
and
humourous
actions
in
the
character
of
niobe
that
made
the
hit
of
the
evening
indeed
he
and
kenneth
harper
quite
carried
off
the
laurels
from
the
other
amateurs
but
so
delighted
were
the
vernondale
young
people
at
the
success
of
the
whole
play
that
they
were
more
than
willing
to
give
the
praise
where
it
belonged
perhaps
the
only
one
in
the
audience
who
failed
to
appreciate
hepworth
clever
work
was
miss
rachel
daggett
she
had
eyes
only
for
her
beloved
nephew
with
an
occasional
side
glance
for
her
pretty
young
neighbour
after
the
entertainment
there
was
a
little
dance
for
the
young
people
and
patty
as
president
of
the
club
received
so
many
compliments
and
so
much
congratulation
that
it
a
wonder
her
curly
head
was
not
turned
but
as
she
walked
home
between
her
father
and
hepworth
she
declared
that
the
success
of
the
evening
was
in
no
way
consequent
upon
her
efforts
but
depended
entirely
on
the
talents
of
the
two
travelling
comedians
from
the
city
chapter
xvii
entertaining
relatives
spring
and
summer
followed
one
another
in
their
usual
succession
and
as
the
months
went
by
boxley
hall
became
more
beautiful
and
more
attractively
homelike
both
inside
and
out
fairfield
bought
a
pair
of
fine
carriage
horses
and
a
pony
and
cart
for
patty
own
use
a
man
was
engaged
to
take
care
of
these
and
also
to
look
after
the
lawn
and
garden
patty
learning
much
from
experience
and
also
from
aunt
occasional
visits
developed
into
a
sensible
and
capable
little
housekeeper
so
determined
was
she
to
make
the
keeping
of
her
house
a
real
success
that
she
tried
most
diligently
to
correct
all
her
errors
and
improve
her
powers
patty
had
a
natural
aptitude
for
domestic
matters
and
after
some
rough
places
were
made
smooth
and
some
sharp
corners
rounded
off
things
went
quite
as
smoothly
as
in
many
houses
where
the
presiding
genius
numbered
twice
patty
years
with
june
came
vacation
and
patty
was
more
than
glad
for
she
was
never
fond
of
school
and
now
could
have
all
her
time
to
devote
to
her
beloved
home
and
too
she
wanted
very
much
to
invite
her
cousins
to
visit
her
which
was
only
possible
in
vacation
time
i
think
papa
she
said
as
they
sat
on
the
veranda
one
june
evening
after
dinner
i
think
i
shall
have
a
house
party
i
shall
invite
all
my
cousins
from
elmbridge
and
philadelphia
and
boston
and
we
have
a
grand
general
reunion
that
will
be
most
beautiful
you
invite
your
aunts
and
uncles
too
said
fairfield
why
i
do
see
how
we
have
room
for
so
many
said
patty
and
of
course
went
on
her
father
you
invite
the
whole
elliott
family
it
would
be
fair
to
leave
them
out
of
your
just
because
they
happen
to
live
in
vernondale
then
patty
saw
that
her
father
was
laughing
at
her
i
know
you
teasing
me
now
papa
she
said
but
i
do
see
why
just
because
i
want
to
ask
my
cousins
to
come
here
and
return
the
visits
i
made
to
them
last
year
but
you
did
visit
them
all
at
once
my
child
and
you
certainly
could
not
expect
to
entertain
them
here
all
at
once
your
list
of
cousins
is
a
very
long
one
and
even
if
there
were
room
for
them
in
the
house
the
care
and
responsibility
of
such
a
house
party
would
be
enough
to
land
you
in
a
sanitarium
when
it
was
over
if
not
before
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
them
said
patty
and
they
not
altogether
congenial
said
her
father
although
i
have
seen
them
as
lately
as
you
have
yet
i
ca
help
thinking
from
what
you
told
me
that
the
barlows
and
the
clairs
would
enjoy
themselves
better
if
they
visited
here
at
different
times
and
i
sure
the
same
is
true
of
your
boston
cousins
you
right
said
patty
as
you
always
are
and
i
do
believe
have
much
fun
with
all
that
company
at
once
either
so
i
think
have
them
in
detachments
and
first
i
just
invite
ethelyn
and
reginald
down
for
a
week
or
two
i
do
really
care
much
about
having
them
but
ethelyn
has
written
so
often
that
she
wants
to
come
that
i
do
see
how
i
can
very
well
get
out
of
it
if
she
wants
to
come
you
certainly
ought
to
ask
her
you
visited
there
three
months
you
know
yes
i
know
it
and
they
were
very
kind
to
me
aunt
isabel
had
parties
and
did
things
for
my
pleasure
all
the
time
well
i
invite
them
right
away
perhaps
i
ought
to
ask
aunt
isabel
too
yes
you
might
ask
her
said
fairfield
and
she
can
bring
the
children
down
but
she
probably
will
not
stay
as
long
as
they
do
so
patty
wrote
for
her
aunt
and
cousins
and
the
first
day
of
july
they
arrived
clair
who
was
patty
aunt
only
by
marriage
was
a
very
fashionable
woman
of
a
pretty
but
somewhat
artificial
type
she
liked
young
people
and
had
spared
no
pains
to
make
patty
visit
to
her
a
happy
one
but
it
was
quite
evident
that
she
expected
patty
to
return
her
hospitality
in
kind
and
she
had
been
at
boxley
hall
but
a
few
hours
before
she
began
to
inquire
what
plans
patty
had
made
for
her
entertainment
now
though
patty
had
thought
out
several
little
pleasures
for
her
cousins
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
aunt
isabel
would
expect
parties
made
for
her
she
evaded
her
aunt
questions
however
and
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
speak
alone
with
her
father
about
it
why
papa
she
exclaimed
that
evening
after
their
guests
had
gone
to
their
rooms
aunt
isabel
expects
me
to
have
a
tea
or
reception
or
something
for
her
nonsense
child
she
ca
think
of
such
a
thing
yes
she
does
papa
and
what
more
i
want
to
do
it
she
was
very
kind
to
me
and
i
rather
please
her
than
ethelyn
i
do
care
much
for
ethelyn
anyway
she
is
just
your
kind
is
she
my
girl
no
she
is
like
marian
nor
any
of
the
club
girls
she
has
her
head
full
of
fashions
and
beaux
and
things
of
all
sorts
she
is
just
my
age
but
you
think
she
was
about
twenty
would
you
yes
she
does
look
almost
as
old
as
that
and
she
acts
quite
as
old
reginald
is
a
nice
boy
yes
but
he
pompous
and
he
always
did
put
on
grand
airs
aunt
isabel
does
too
but
she
so
and
generous
nobody
can
help
liking
her
well
have
a
party
for
her
if
you
want
to
chicken
but
do
take
the
responsibility
of
it
entirely
on
yourself
i
should
think
you
might
make
it
a
pretty
little
afternoon
tea
get
aunt
alice
to
make
out
the
invitation
list
she
knows
better
than
you
what
ladies
to
invite
and
then
let
pacetti
send
up
whatever
you
want
for
the
feast
i
no
doubt
pansy
will
be
willing
to
attend
to
the
floral
decoration
of
the
house
i
no
doubt
she
will
said
patty
laughing
the
trouble
will
be
to
stop
her
before
she
turns
the
whole
place
into
a
horticultural
exhibit
well
go
ahead
with
it
patty
i
think
it
will
please
your
aunt
very
much
but
do
wear
yourself
out
over
it
next
morning
at
breakfast
patty
announced
her
plan
for
an
afternoon
tea
and
aunt
isabel
was
delighted
you
dear
child
she
exclaimed
how
sweet
of
you
i
hate
to
have
you
go
to
any
trouble
on
my
account
but
i
shall
be
so
pleased
to
meet
the
vernondale
ladies
i
want
to
know
what
kind
of
people
my
niece
is
growing
up
among
i
sure
you
like
them
aunt
isabel
aunt
alice
friends
are
lovely
and
then
i
ask
the
mothers
of
the
tea
club
girls
and
my
neighbour
miss
daggett
but
i
do
believe
she
come
is
that
the
rich
miss
daggett
asked
aunt
isabel
curiously
the
queer
one
i
do
know
whether
she
rich
or
not
said
patty
i
dare
say
she
is
though
because
she
has
lovely
things
but
she
certainly
can
be
called
queer
i
very
fond
of
her
though
she
awfully
nice
to
me
and
i
like
her
in
spite
of
her
queerness
but
you
ask
some
young
ladies
too
wo
you
said
ethelyn
i
do
care
very
much
for
queer
old
maids
and
married
ladies
oh
this
is
for
you
ethel
said
patty
i
have
a
party
for
you
and
reginald
some
other
day
children
party
indeed
said
ethelyn
turning
up
her
haughty
little
nose
you
know
very
well
patty
i
have
considered
myself
a
child
for
years
nor
i
said
reginald
well
i
consider
myself
one
said
patty
i
not
in
a
bit
of
hurry
to
be
but
we
going
to
have
a
lovely
sailing
party
ethelyn
on
fourth
of
july
and
i
sure
you
enjoy
that
are
any
young
men
going
said
ethelyn
there
are
a
lot
of
boys
going
said
patty
but
the
only
young
men
will
be
my
father
and
uncle
charley
and
mr
hepworth
who
is
mr
hepworth
he
an
artist
friend
of
papa
who
comes
out
quite
often
and
who
always
goes
sailing
with
us
when
we
have
sailing
parties
aunt
alice
was
more
than
willing
to
help
patty
with
her
project
and
the
result
was
a
very
pretty
little
afternoon
tea
at
boxley
hall
i
so
glad
i
brought
my
white
said
aunt
isabel
as
she
dressed
for
the
occasion
i
glad
too
said
patty
for
it
a
lovely
gown
and
you
look
sweet
in
it
i
brought
a
lot
of
pretty
dresses
too
said
ethelyn
and
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
put
on
one
of
the
prettiest
as
there
no
use
in
wasting
them
on
those
children
parties
you
talking
about
do
just
as
you
like
ethelyn
said
patty
knowing
that
her
cousin
was
always
overdressed
on
all
occasions
and
therefore
it
made
little
difference
what
she
wore
and
sure
enough
ethelyn
arrayed
herself
in
a
most
resplendent
gown
which
though
very
beautiful
was
made
in
a
style
more
suited
to
a
belle
of
several
seasons
than
a
young
miss
of
sixteen
patty
wore
one
of
her
pretty
little
white
house
dresses
and
aunt
alice
in
a
lovely
gray
gown
assisted
her
to
receive
the
guests
and
to
introduce
clair
and
her
children
among
the
late
arrivals
was
miss
daggett
her
coming
created
a
sensation
for
as
was
well
known
in
vernondale
she
rarely
attended
social
affairs
of
any
sort
but
for
some
unknown
reason
she
chose
to
accept
invitation
and
garbed
in
an
brown
velvet
she
was
presented
to
clair
i
so
glad
to
see
you
said
the
latter
shaking
hands
effusively
humph
said
miss
daggett
why
should
you
be
glad
to
see
me
pray
why
because
because
clair
floundered
a
little
and
seemed
really
unable
to
give
any
reason
because
you
heard
that
i
rich
and
old
and
queer
said
miss
daggett
this
was
exactly
true
but
clair
did
not
care
to
admit
it
so
she
said
why
no
not
that
but
i
heard
my
niece
speak
of
you
so
often
that
i
felt
anxious
to
meet
you
well
i
not
afraid
of
anything
patty
fairfield
said
about
me
she
a
dear
little
girl
i
very
fond
of
her
why
do
you
call
her
little
girl
said
clair
patty
is
in
her
seventeenth
year
surely
that
is
not
quite
a
child
but
she
is
a
child
at
heart
said
miss
daggett
and
i
am
glad
of
it
i
would
far
rather
see
her
with
her
pretty
sunshiny
childish
ways
than
to
see
her
like
that
overdressed
little
minx
standing
over
there
beside
her
whoever
she
may
be
that
my
daughter
said
clair
without
however
looking
as
deeply
offended
as
she
might
have
done
oh
is
it
said
miss
daggett
sniffing
well
i
see
no
reason
to
change
my
opinion
of
her
if
she
is
no
said
clair
of
course
we
are
each
entitled
to
our
own
opinion
now
i
think
my
daughter
more
appropriately
dressed
than
my
niece
and
i
think
your
nephew
will
agree
with
me
she
added
smiling
my
nephew
snapped
miss
daggett
do
you
know
him
oh
yes
indeed
we
met
harper
at
a
reception
in
new
york
not
long
ago
and
he
was
very
much
charmed
with
my
daughter
ethelyn
he
may
have
seemed
so
said
miss
daggett
scornfully
he
is
a
very
polite
young
man
but
let
me
tell
you
he
admires
patty
fairfield
more
than
any
other
girl
he
has
ever
seen
he
told
me
so
himself
and
now
go
away
if
you
please
i
tired
of
talking
to
you
clair
was
not
very
much
surprised
at
this
speech
for
patty
had
told
her
of
miss
daggett
summary
method
of
dismissing
people
and
so
with
a
sweet
smile
and
a
bow
the
fashionable
matron
left
the
eccentric
and
indignant
spinster
chapter
xviii
a
sailing
party
after
aunt
isabel
had
gone
home
patty
devoted
herself
to
the
entertainment
of
her
young
cousins
and
they
seemed
to
require
a
great
deal
of
entertainment
both
ethelyn
and
reginald
wanted
something
done
for
their
pleasure
all
the
time
they
did
not
hesitate
to
express
very
freely
their
opinions
of
the
pleasures
planned
for
them
and
as
they
were
sophisticated
young
persons
they
frequently
scorned
the
simple
gaieties
in
which
patty
and
her
vernondale
companions
found
pleasure
however
they
condescended
to
be
pleased
at
the
idea
of
a
sailing
party
for
as
there
was
no
water
near
their
own
home
a
yacht
was
a
novelty
to
them
at
first
ethelyn
thought
to
appear
interesting
by
expressing
timid
doubts
as
to
the
safety
of
the
picnic
party
but
she
soon
found
that
the
vernondale
young
people
had
no
foolish
fears
of
that
sort
fourth
of
july
was
a
bright
clear
day
warm
but
very
pleasant
with
a
good
stiff
breeze
blowing
patty
was
up
early
and
when
ethelyn
came
downstairs
she
found
her
cousin
with
the
aid
of
mancy
and
pansy
packing
up
what
seemed
to
be
luncheon
enough
for
the
whole
party
does
anybody
else
take
anything
she
inquired
oh
yes
said
patty
they
all
do
i
only
taking
cold
chicken
and
stuffed
eggs
you
no
idea
what
an
appetite
sailing
gives
you
ethelyn
looked
very
pretty
in
a
yachting
suit
of
white
serge
while
patty
sailor
gown
was
of
more
prosaic
blue
flannel
trimmed
with
white
braid
that
a
sweet
dress
ethelyn
said
patty
but
i
awfully
afraid
you
spoil
it
you
know
we
do
go
in
a
beautiful
yacht
all
white
paint
and
polished
brass
we
go
in
a
big
old
schooner
that
roomy
and
safe
but
not
overly
clean
oh
it
does
matter
said
ethelyn
i
dare
say
i
shall
spoil
it
but
i
nothing
else
that
just
right
to
wear
all
aboard
shouted
a
cheery
voice
and
kenneth
harper
laughing
face
appeared
in
the
doorway
oh
cried
patty
smiling
gaily
back
at
him
i
so
glad
to
see
you
this
is
my
cousin
miss
clair
ethelyn
may
i
present
mr
harper
immediately
ethelyn
assumed
a
coquettish
and
simpering
demeanour
i
met
harper
before
she
said
though
i
dare
say
he
remember
me
oh
yes
indeed
i
do
said
kenneth
gallantly
we
met
at
a
reception
in
the
city
and
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
again
especially
on
such
a
jolly
occasion
as
i
feel
sure
is
going
to
be
do
you
think
it
is
quite
safe
said
ethelyn
with
what
she
considered
a
charming
timidity
i
never
been
sailing
you
know
and
i
not
very
brave
oh
pshaw
of
course
it
safe
barring
accidents
but
you
always
liable
to
those
even
in
an
automobile
hello
here
comes
hepworth
glad
to
see
you
old
chap
hepworth
received
a
general
storm
of
glad
greetings
was
presented
to
the
strangers
and
announced
himself
as
ready
to
carry
baskets
boxes
rugs
wraps
or
whatever
was
to
be
transported
fairfield
as
general
manager
portioned
out
the
luggage
and
then
each
picking
up
his
individual
charge
they
started
off
on
the
way
they
met
the
elliott
family
similarly
equipped
and
equally
enthusiastic
and
the
whole
crowd
proceeded
down
to
the
wharf
there
they
found
about
thirty
young
people
awaiting
them
all
the
girls
of
the
tea
club
were
there
and
all
the
boys
who
insisted
on
calling
themselves
honorary
members
of
the
club
it
a
beautiful
day
said
guy
morris
but
no
good
at
all
for
sailing
the
breeze
has
died
down
entirely
and
i
do
believe
it
will
come
up
again
all
day
that
real
cheerful
is
it
said
frank
elliott
i
should
be
inclined
to
doubt
it
myself
but
guy
is
such
a
weatherwise
genius
and
he
almost
never
makes
a
mistake
in
his
prognostications
well
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
the
day
will
bring
forth
said
uncle
charley
but
in
the
meantime
we
get
aboard
the
laughing
crowd
piled
themselves
on
board
the
big
schooner
stowed
away
all
the
baskets
and
bundles
and
settled
themselves
comfortably
in
various
parts
of
the
boat
some
sat
in
the
stern
others
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
cabin
while
others
preferred
the
bow
and
one
or
two
adventurous
spirits
clambered
out
to
the
end
of
the
long
bowsprit
and
sat
with
their
feet
dangling
above
the
water
ethelyn
gave
some
affected
little
cries
of
horror
at
this
but
frank
elliott
reassured
her
by
telling
her
that
it
was
always
a
part
of
the
performance
why
i
have
seen
your
dignified
cousin
patty
do
it
in
fact
she
generally
festoons
herself
along
the
edge
of
the
boat
in
some
precarious
position
do
do
it
will
you
patty
besought
ethelyn
with
a
ridiculous
air
of
solicitude
no
i
wo
said
patty
i
be
real
good
and
do
just
as
you
want
me
to
noble
girl
said
kenneth
harper
i
know
how
hard
it
is
for
you
to
be
good
it
is
indeed
said
patty
laughing
and
i
insist
upon
having
due
credit
as
a
rule
the
vernondale
parties
were
exciting
affairs
the
route
was
down
the
river
to
the
sound
from
the
sound
to
the
bay
and
if
the
day
were
very
favourable
out
into
the
ocean
and
perhaps
around
staten
island
patty
had
hoped
for
this
most
extended
trip
today
in
order
that
ethelyn
and
reginald
might
see
a
sailing
party
at
its
very
best
but
after
they
had
been
on
board
an
hour
they
had
covered
only
the
few
miles
of
river
and
found
themselves
well
out
into
the
sound
but
with
no
seeming
prospect
of
going
any
farther
the
breeze
had
died
away
entirely
and
as
the
sun
rose
higher
the
heat
was
becoming
decidedly
uncomfortable
ethelyn
began
to
fidget
her
pretty
white
serge
frock
had
come
in
contact
with
some
muddy
ropes
and
some
oily
screws
and
several
unsightly
spots
were
the
result
this
made
her
cross
for
she
hated
to
have
her
costume
spoiled
so
early
in
the
day
and
besides
she
was
unpleasantly
conscious
that
her
fair
complexion
was
rapidly
taking
on
a
deep
shade
of
red
she
knew
this
was
unbecoming
but
when
reginald
with
brotherly
frankness
informed
her
that
her
nose
looked
like
a
poppy
bud
she
lost
her
temper
and
relapsed
into
a
sulky
fit
i
do
see
any
fun
in
a
sailing
party
if
this
is
one
she
said
oh
this
is
one
said
guy
morris
this
is
just
a
fizzle
we
often
have
them
and
though
they
not
as
much
fun
as
a
real
good
sailing
party
yet
we
manage
to
get
a
good
time
out
of
them
some
way
i
do
see
how
said
ethelyn
who
was
growing
very
we
show
you
said
frank
elliott
kindly
there
are
lots
of
things
to
do
on
board
a
boat
besides
sail
there
did
seem
to
be
and
notwithstanding
the
heat
and
the
sunburn
yes
even
the
mosquitoes
those
young
people
found
ways
to
have
a
real
good
time
they
sang
songs
and
told
stories
and
jokes
and
showed
each
other
clever
little
games
and
tricks
one
of
the
boys
had
a
camera
and
he
took
pictures
of
the
whole
crowd
both
singly
and
in
groups
hepworth
drew
caricature
portraits
and
kenneth
harper
gave
some
of
his
funny
impersonations
except
for
the
responsibility
of
her
cousin
entertainment
patty
enjoyed
herself
exceedingly
but
then
she
was
always
a
happy
little
girl
and
never
allowed
herself
to
be
discomfited
by
trifles
everybody
was
surprised
when
aunt
alice
announced
that
it
was
time
for
luncheon
and
though
all
were
disappointed
at
the
failure
of
the
sail
everybody
seemed
to
take
it
philosophically
and
even
merrily
what
is
the
matter
said
ethelyn
why
do
we
go
the
matter
is
said
fairfield
we
are
becalmed
there
is
no
breeze
and
consequently
nothing
to
make
our
bonny
ship
move
so
she
stands
still
and
are
we
going
to
stay
right
here
all
day
asked
ethelyn
it
looks
very
much
like
it
unless
an
ocean
steamer
comes
along
and
gives
us
a
tow
aunt
alice
and
the
girls
of
the
party
soon
had
the
luncheon
ready
and
the
merry
feast
was
made
as
frank
remarked
it
was
a
very
different
thing
to
sit
there
in
the
broiling
sun
and
eat
sandwiches
and
devilled
eggs
or
to
consume
the
same
viands
with
the
yacht
madly
flying
along
in
rolling
waves
and
dashing
spray
the
afternoon
palled
a
little
youthful
enthusiasm
and
determined
good
temper
could
make
light
of
several
hours
of
discomfort
but
toward
three
the
sun
rays
grew
unbearably
hot
the
glare
from
the
water
was
very
trying
and
the
mosquitoes
were
something
awful
guy
morris
who
probably
spent
more
of
his
time
in
a
boat
than
any
of
the
others
declared
that
he
had
never
seen
such
a
day
fairfield
felt
sorry
for
ethelyn
who
had
never
had
such
an
experience
before
and
so
he
exerted
himself
to
entertain
her
but
she
resisted
all
his
attempts
and
even
though
patty
came
to
her
assistance
they
found
it
impossible
to
make
their
guest
happy
reginald
was
no
better
he
growled
and
fretted
about
the
heat
and
other
discomforts
and
he
was
so
pompous
and
overbearing
in
his
manner
that
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
boys
of
vernondale
cordially
disliked
him
as
long
as
we
ca
go
sailing
said
ethelyn
i
should
think
we
would
go
home
we
ca
get
home
said
patty
patiently
she
had
already
explained
this
several
times
to
her
cousin
there
is
no
breeze
to
take
us
anywhere
well
what
will
happen
to
us
then
shall
we
stay
here
forever
there
ought
to
be
a
breeze
in
two
or
three
days
said
kenneth
harper
who
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
chaff
this
young
person
say
by
tuesday
or
wednesday
i
should
think
a
capful
of
wind
might
puff
up
in
some
direction
it
is
coming
now
said
frank
elliott
suddenly
i
certainly
feel
a
draught
put
something
around
you
my
boy
said
his
mother
i
do
want
you
to
take
cold
let
me
get
you
a
wrap
said
frank
smiling
back
at
his
mother
who
was
fanning
herself
with
a
folded
newspaper
the
wind
is
coming
said
guy
morris
and
his
serious
face
was
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
merry
ones
about
him
and
it
no
joke
this
time
within
ten
minutes
there
be
a
stiff
breeze
and
within
twenty
a
howling
gale
or
i
no
sailor
as
he
spoke
he
was
busily
preparing
to
reef
the
mainsail
and
he
consulted
hurriedly
with
the
sailors
at
first
no
one
could
believe
guy
prophecies
would
come
true
but
in
a
few
moments
the
cool
breeze
was
distinctly
felt
the
sun
went
under
a
cloud
and
the
boat
began
to
move
it
was
a
sudden
squall
and
the
clouds
thickened
and
massed
themselves
into
great
hills
of
blackness
the
water
turned
dark
and
began
to
rise
in
little
threatening
billows
the
wind
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
then
without
warning
the
rain
came
thunder
and
lightning
added
to
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
and
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
the
smooth
sunny
glare
of
water
was
at
the
mercy
of
a
fearful
storm
the
occupants
of
the
boat
seemed
to
know
exactly
how
to
behave
in
these
circumstances
elliott
and
the
girls
of
the
party
went
down
into
the
little
cabin
which
held
them
all
but
which
was
very
crowded
guy
morris
took
command
and
the
other
boys
and
men
too
for
that
matter
did
exactly
as
he
told
them
ethelyn
began
to
cry
this
was
really
not
surprising
as
the
girl
had
never
before
had
such
an
experience
and
was
exceedingly
nervous
as
well
as
very
much
frightened
elliott
appreciated
this
and
putting
her
arm
around
the
sobbing
child
comforted
her
with
great
tact
and
patience
the
storm
passed
as
quickly
as
it
came
there
had
been
danger
both
real
and
plentiful
but
no
bad
results
attended
except
that
everybody
was
more
or
less
wet
with
the
rain
the
boys
were
more
and
the
girls
less
but
to
ethelyn
surprise
they
all
seemed
to
view
the
whole
performance
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
and
accepted
the
situation
with
the
same
merry
philosophy
that
they
had
shown
in
the
morning
the
thermometer
had
fallen
many
degrees
and
the
cold
wind
against
damp
clothing
caused
a
most
unpleasant
sensation
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
said
guy
this
breeze
will
take
us
home
spinning
i
glad
of
it
said
ethelyn
snappishly
i
had
quite
enough
of
the
sailing
party
frank
confided
to
patty
afterward
that
he
felt
like
responding
that
the
sailing
party
had
had
quite
enough
of
her
but
instead
he
said
politely
oh
do
be
so
easily
discouraged
better
luck
next
time
to
which
ethelyn
replied
still
crossly
there
be
no
next
time
for
me
chapter
xix
more
cousins
patty
was
not
sorry
when
her
elmbridge
cousins
concluded
their
visit
and
the
evening
after
their
departure
she
sat
on
the
veranda
with
her
father
talking
about
them
it
a
pity
she
said
that
ethelyn
is
so
for
she
so
pretty
and
graceful
and
she
really
very
bright
and
entertaining
when
she
is
pleased
but
so
much
of
the
time
she
is
displeased
and
then
there
no
doing
anything
with
her
she
selfish
patty
said
her
father
and
selfishness
is
just
about
the
worst
fault
in
the
catalogue
a
selfish
person
can
not
be
happy
you
probably
learned
something
to
that
effect
from
your
early
copybooks
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
i
know
it
papa
and
i
do
think
that
selfish
ness
is
the
worst
fault
there
is
and
though
i
fight
against
it
do
you
know
i
sometimes
think
that
living
here
alone
with
you
and
having
my
own
way
in
everything
is
making
me
rather
a
selfish
individual
myself
i
do
think
you
need
worry
about
that
said
a
hearty
voice
and
kenneth
harper
appeared
at
the
veranda
steps
pardon
me
i
eavesdropping
but
i
could
help
overhearing
your
last
remark
and
i
think
it
my
duty
to
set
your
mind
at
rest
on
that
score
selfishness
is
not
your
besetting
sin
miss
patty
fairfield
and
i
ca
allow
you
to
libel
yourself
i
quite
agree
with
you
ken
said
fairfield
my
small
daughter
may
not
be
absolutely
perfect
but
selfishness
is
not
one
of
her
faults
at
least
that
the
conclusion
i
come
to
after
observing
her
pretty
carefully
through
her
long
and
checkered
career
well
if
i
not
selfish
i
will
certainly
become
vain
if
so
many
compliments
are
heaped
upon
me
said
patty
laughing
and
i
sure
i
value
very
highly
the
opinions
of
two
such
wise
men
oh
say
a
man
and
a
boy
said
young
harper
modestly
all
right
i
will
said
patty
but
i
not
sure
which
is
which
sometimes
i
think
papa
more
of
a
boy
than
you
are
ken
now
you
succeeded
in
complimenting
us
both
at
once
said
fairfield
which
proves
you
clever
as
well
as
unselfish
well
never
mind
me
for
the
present
said
patty
i
want
to
talk
about
some
other
people
and
they
are
some
more
of
my
cousins
a
commodity
with
which
you
seem
to
be
well
supplied
said
kenneth
indeed
i
am
i
have
a
large
stock
yet
in
reserve
and
i
think
papa
that
i
ask
bob
and
bumble
to
visit
me
for
a
few
weeks
do
said
fairfield
if
you
would
enjoy
having
them
but
not
otherwise
you
just
been
through
a
siege
of
entertaining
cousins
and
i
think
you
deserve
a
vacation
oh
but
these
are
so
different
said
patty
bob
and
bumble
are
nothing
like
the
clairs
they
enjoy
everything
and
they
always
happy
i
like
their
name
said
kenneth
bumble
is
exactly
romantic
but
it
sounds
awfully
jolly
she
is
jolly
said
patty
and
so
is
bob
they
twins
about
sixteen
and
they
just
brimming
over
with
fun
and
mischief
bumble
real
name
is
helen
but
i
guess
no
one
ever
called
her
that
helen
seems
to
mean
a
fair
tall
girl
slender
and
graceful
and
rather
willowy
and
bumble
is
just
the
opposite
of
that
she
round
and
solid
and
always
tumbling
down
at
least
she
used
to
be
but
she
may
have
outgrown
that
habit
now
anyway
she
a
dear
and
what
is
bob
like
asked
her
father
i
have
seen
him
since
he
was
a
baby
bob
oh
he
just
plain
boy
awfully
nice
and
obliging
and
and
unselfish
but
i
do
believe
he
ever
be
president
i
think
i
shall
like
your
two
cousins
said
kenneth
with
an
air
of
conviction
when
are
they
coming
i
shall
ask
them
right
away
and
i
hope
they
soon
come
how
much
longer
shall
you
be
in
vernondale
oh
i
think
i
a
fixture
for
the
summer
aunt
locky
wants
me
to
spend
my
whole
vacation
here
and
i
do
know
of
any
good
reason
why
i
should
i
very
glad
it
will
be
awfully
nice
to
have
you
here
when
the
twins
are
and
perhaps
somebody
else
will
be
here
too
i
going
to
ask
nan
allen
who
is
she
inquired
fairfield
oh
papa
do
you
remember
about
her
she
is
a
friend
of
the
barlows
and
lives
near
them
in
philadelphia
and
she
was
visiting
them
down
at
long
island
when
i
was
there
last
summer
she
perfectly
lovely
she
a
young
lady
compared
to
bumble
and
me
she
about
i
think
and
i
know
kenneth
will
lose
his
heart
to
her
he
have
no
more
use
for
schoolgirls
probably
not
said
kenneth
but
i
afraid
the
adorable
young
lady
will
have
no
use
for
me
she
wo
if
hepworth
around
and
he
usually
is
he
always
cutting
me
out
nothing
of
the
sort
said
patty
staunchly
hepworth
is
very
nice
but
he
papa
friend
and
whose
friend
am
i
said
young
harper
you
everybody
friend
said
patty
smiling
at
him
you
just
ken
miss
nan
allen
was
delighted
to
accept
an
invitation
to
boxley
hall
and
it
was
arranged
that
she
and
the
barlow
twins
should
spend
august
there
a
month
is
quite
a
long
visit
pattikins
said
her
father
yes
but
you
see
papa
i
stayed
there
three
months
now
if
three
of
them
stay
here
one
month
it
will
be
the
same
proportion
and
besides
i
like
them
and
i
want
them
to
stay
a
good
while
i
get
tired
of
them
i
do
believe
you
will
but
you
may
get
tired
of
the
care
of
housekeeping
with
guests
for
so
long
a
time
but
if
you
do
i
shall
pick
up
the
whole
tribe
of
you
and
bundle
off
for
a
trip
of
some
sort
oh
papa
i
wish
you
would
do
that
i
be
perfectly
delighted
i
do
my
best
to
get
tired
just
so
you
take
us
but
if
i
remember
your
reports
of
your
barlow
cousins
it
seems
to
me
they
would
not
make
the
most
desirable
travelling
companions
are
they
the
ones
who
were
so
never
were
ready
on
time
never
knew
where
things
were
and
in
fact
had
never
learned
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
and
order
yes
they
the
ones
and
truly
they
are
something
dreadful
do
you
remember
they
had
a
party
and
forgot
to
send
out
the
invitations
and
the
first
night
i
reached
there
when
i
went
to
visit
them
they
forgot
to
have
any
bed
in
my
room
yes
i
thought
i
remembered
your
writing
to
me
about
some
such
doings
and
do
you
think
you
can
enjoy
a
month
with
such
visitors
as
that
oh
yes
papa
because
they
wo
upset
house
and
really
the
dearest
people
oh
i
awfully
fond
of
bob
and
bumble
i
and
nan
allen
is
lovely
nobody
can
help
liking
her
she
not
so
as
the
others
but
down
at
the
nobody
could
help
losing
their
things
why
i
even
grew
careless
myself
well
have
your
company
child
and
i
do
all
i
can
to
make
it
pleasant
for
you
and
for
them
i
know
you
will
you
dear
old
pearl
of
a
father
sometimes
i
think
you
enjoy
my
company
as
much
as
i
do
myself
but
i
suppose
you
do
really
i
suppose
you
entertain
the
young
people
and
pretend
to
enjoy
it
just
to
make
me
happy
i
am
happy
dear
in
anything
that
makes
you
happy
though
sixteen
is
not
exactly
an
age
contemporary
with
my
own
but
i
enjoy
having
hepworth
down
and
i
like
young
harper
a
great
deal
then
of
course
i
have
my
little
friends
and
elliott
to
play
with
so
i
am
not
entirely
dependent
on
the
kindergarten
the
barlow
twins
and
nan
allen
were
expected
to
arrive
on
thursday
afternoon
at
four
and
everything
at
boxley
hall
was
in
readiness
for
the
arrival
of
the
guests
not
that
it
worth
while
to
have
everything
in
such
order
said
patty
to
herself
for
the
barlows
wo
appreciate
it
and
what
more
they
turn
everything
inside
out
and
upside
down
before
they
been
in
the
house
an
hour
but
notwithstanding
her
conviction
she
made
her
preparations
as
carefully
as
if
for
the
most
fastidious
visitors
and
viewed
the
result
with
great
satisfaction
after
it
was
finished
she
went
down
in
the
carriage
to
meet
the
train
delighted
at
the
thought
of
seeing
again
her
barlow
cousins
of
whom
she
was
really
very
fond
i
wish
aunt
grace
and
uncle
ted
were
coming
too
she
said
to
herself
but
i
suppose
i
could
take
care
of
so
many
people
at
once
it
would
be
like
running
a
hotel
the
train
had
not
arrived
when
they
reached
the
station
so
telling
the
coachman
to
wait
patty
left
the
carriage
and
walked
up
and
down
the
station
platform
hello
patty
have
your
cousins
come
yet
why
kenneth
is
that
you
no
they
have
come
i
think
the
train
must
be
late
yes
it
is
a
little
but
there
it
is
now
just
coming
into
sight
around
the
curve
may
i
stay
and
meet
them
or
would
you
rather
fall
on
their
necks
alone
oh
stay
i
be
glad
to
have
you
but
you
have
to
walk
back
no
room
in
the
carriage
for
you
oh
that
all
right
i
have
my
wheel
thank
you
the
train
stopped
and
a
number
of
passengers
alighted
but
as
the
train
went
on
and
the
small
crowd
dispersed
patty
remarked
in
a
most
exasperated
tone
well
they
did
come
on
that
train
i
just
knew
they
would
they
are
the
most
aggravating
people
now
nobody
knows
whether
they
were
on
that
train
and
did
know
enough
to
get
off
or
whether
they
missed
it
at
the
new
york
end
what
time
is
the
next
train
i
not
sure
said
kenneth
let
go
in
the
station
and
find
out
the
next
train
was
due
at
but
the
expected
guests
did
not
arrive
on
that
either
there
no
use
in
getting
annoyed
said
patty
laughing
for
really
nothing
more
nor
less
than
i
expected
the
barlows
never
catch
the
train
they
intend
to
take
and
miss
allen
is
she
the
same
kind
of
an
reliable
no
nan
is
different
and
i
believe
that
left
to
herself
she
be
on
time
though
probably
not
ahead
of
time
but
i
never
seen
her
except
with
the
barlows
and
when
she
was
down
at
the
she
was
just
about
as
uncertain
as
the
rest
of
them
is
the
the
barlow
homestead
well
it
their
summer
home
and
it
really
a
lovely
place
but
its
name
just
expresses
it
i
spent
three
months
there
last
summer
and
i
had
an
awfully
good
time
but
no
one
ever
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
next
or
when
it
would
come
off
but
everybody
was
so
that
they
did
mind
a
bit
well
i
suppose
we
may
as
well
drive
back
home
there
no
telling
when
these
people
will
come
very
likely
not
until
just
then
a
small
messenger
boy
came
up
to
patty
and
handed
her
a
telegram
just
as
i
thought
exclaimed
patty
they
done
some
crazy
thing
opening
the
yellow
envelope
she
read
took
wrong
train
carried
through
to
philadelphia
back
this
evening
bob
well
then
they
ca
get
here
until
that
train
comes
in
said
kenneth
so
there
no
use
in
your
waiting
any
longer
now
no
i
suppose
not
said
patty
i
awfully
disappointed
i
wish
they
had
come
an
train
had
just
come
into
the
station
and
patty
and
kenneth
stood
idly
watching
it
when
suddenly
patty
exclaimed
there
they
are
now
did
you
ever
know
such
ridiculous
people
chapter
xx
a
fair
exchange
we
did
have
to
go
to
philadelphia
after
all
explained
bob
after
greetings
had
been
exchanged
we
found
we
could
get
off
at
new
brunswick
and
come
back
from
there
why
did
you
find
out
that
before
telegraphing
laughed
patty
never
once
thought
of
it
said
bob
you
know
the
barlows
are
not
noted
for
ingenuity
well
they
noted
for
better
things
than
that
said
patty
as
she
affectionately
squeezed
bumble
plump
arm
we
would
have
thought
of
it
at
all
said
honest
bob
if
it
been
for
nan
she
suggested
it
well
i
was
sent
along
with
instructions
to
look
after
you
two
youngsters
said
nan
and
so
i
had
to
do
something
to
live
up
to
my
privileges
and
now
bob
you
look
after
the
luggage
will
you
let
me
help
said
kenneth
where
are
your
checks
miss
allen
here
are
the
checks
for
the
trunks
and
there
are
three
the
one
that
has
any
name
on
is
mine
and
you
tell
it
by
the
fact
that
it
has
an
extra
handle
on
the
end
i
very
proud
of
that
handle
i
had
it
put
on
by
special
order
and
it
so
convenient
and
it
is
identification
besides
i
did
want
my
name
painted
on
i
think
it
spoils
a
to
have
letters
all
over
it
we
find
them
all
right
come
on
barlow
said
kenneth
and
the
two
young
men
started
off
they
returned
in
a
few
moments
with
the
three
bob
bringing
his
own
and
his
sister
while
kenneth
harper
carefully
carried
the
immaculate
leather
case
with
the
handle
on
the
end
these
were
deposited
in
the
fairfield
carriage
patty
and
her
guests
were
also
tucked
in
and
they
started
for
the
house
while
kenneth
followed
on
his
wheel
come
over
patty
called
back
to
him
as
they
left
him
behind
and
though
his
answer
was
lost
in
the
distance
she
had
little
doubt
as
to
its
tenor
what
a
nice
young
fellow
said
nan
who
is
he
he
the
nephew
of
our
neighbour
said
patty
and
spending
his
vacation
with
his
aunt
he
a
jolly
chap
said
bob
yes
he
just
that
said
patty
i
thought
you
like
him
you
like
all
the
young
people
here
they
an
awfully
nice
crowd
i
so
glad
to
see
again
said
bumble
i
do
care
whether
i
like
the
other
young
people
or
not
and
i
want
to
see
uncle
fred
too
i
have
seen
him
for
years
and
years
oh
he
one
of
the
young
people
said
patty
laughing
he
goes
everywhere
with
us
i
tell
him
he
more
of
a
boy
than
ken
as
they
drove
up
to
the
house
bumble
exclaimed
with
delight
at
the
beautiful
flowers
and
the
appearance
of
the
whole
place
what
a
lovely
home
she
cried
i
do
see
how
you
ever
put
up
with
our
old
place
patty
nonsense
said
patty
i
had
the
time
of
my
life
down
at
the
last
summer
well
we
going
to
have
the
time
of
our
life
at
boxley
hall
this
summer
i
feel
sure
of
that
said
bob
as
he
sprang
out
of
the
carriage
and
then
helped
the
others
out
i
hope
you
will
said
patty
you
are
very
welcome
to
boxley
hall
and
i
want
you
just
to
look
upon
it
as
your
home
and
conduct
yourselves
accordingly
nan
can
do
that
said
bumble
but
i
afraid
if
bob
and
i
did
it
your
beautiful
home
would
soon
lose
its
present
effect
all
right
let
it
lose
said
patty
we
have
a
good
time
anyhow
and
now
she
went
on
as
she
took
the
guests
to
their
rooms
there
be
just
about
an
hour
before
dinner
time
but
if
you
get
ready
before
that
come
down
you
probably
find
me
on
the
front
veranda
if
i
not
in
the
kitchen
bob
was
the
first
one
to
reappear
and
he
found
patty
and
her
father
chatting
on
the
front
veranda
how
do
you
do
uncle
fred
he
said
you
may
know
my
name
but
i
doubt
if
you
remember
my
features
hello
bob
my
boy
said
fairfield
cordially
grasping
the
hand
held
out
to
him
as
i
last
saw
you
with
features
of
infantile
vacancy
i
am
glad
to
start
fresh
and
make
your
acquaintance
all
over
again
thank
you
sir
said
bob
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
veranda
railing
i
did
know
you
as
an
infant
but
i
dare
say
you
were
a
very
attractive
one
i
think
i
was
said
fairfield
at
least
i
remember
hearing
my
mother
say
so
and
surely
she
ought
to
know
just
then
bumble
came
out
on
the
porch
with
her
in
her
hand
please
tie
this
for
me
patty
she
said
i
can
not
manage
it
myself
and
get
it
on
quick
before
uncle
fred
sees
me
but
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
my
dear
bumble
said
fairfield
that
even
that
piece
of
pretty
blue
ribbon
ca
make
me
any
gladder
bumble
smiled
back
at
him
in
her
winning
way
and
patty
tied
her
with
a
decided
feeling
of
relief
that
in
all
other
respects
bumble
costume
was
tidy
and
complete
where
nan
she
inquired
is
she
ready
yet
why
it
the
funniest
thing
said
bumble
i
tapped
at
her
door
as
i
came
by
but
she
told
me
to
go
on
and
not
wait
for
her
she
would
come
down
in
a
few
minutes
just
as
pansy
appeared
to
announce
dinner
nan
did
come
down
and
patty
stared
at
her
in
amazement
bob
whistled
and
bumble
exclaimed
well
for
goodness
gracious
sakes
what
are
you
up
to
now
for
nan
instead
of
wearing
the
pretty
gown
which
bumble
knew
she
had
brought
in
her
suitcase
was
garbed
in
the
complete
costume
of
a
trained
nurse
a
white
piqué
skirt
and
linen
of
immaculate
and
starched
whiteness
an
apron
with
regulation
and
a
cap
that
betokened
a
graduate
of
luke
hospital
formed
her
surprising
but
not
at
all
unbecoming
outfit
nan
roguish
face
looked
very
demure
under
the
white
cap
and
she
smiled
pleasantly
when
patty
at
last
recovered
her
wits
sufficiently
to
introduce
her
father
nan
she
said
if
this
is
really
you
let
me
present
my
father
and
papa
this
is
supposed
to
be
miss
nan
allen
but
i
never
saw
her
look
like
this
before
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
miss
allen
said
fairfield
and
though
we
are
all
apparently
very
well
at
present
one
can
never
tell
how
soon
there
may
be
need
of
your
professional
services
i
hope
not
very
soon
said
nan
laughing
for
my
professional
knowledge
is
scarcely
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
adjust
this
costume
properly
it
seems
to
be
on
all
right
said
patty
looking
at
it
critically
but
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
it
and
what
have
you
got
it
on
for
not
going
to
a
masquerade
i
put
it
on
said
nan
because
i
could
help
myself
i
wanted
to
change
my
travelling
gown
and
when
i
opened
my
this
is
all
there
was
in
it
except
some
combs
and
brushes
and
bottles
whew
said
bob
when
i
picked
up
that
i
was
quite
sure
i
had
the
right
one
you
know
i
went
back
for
it
after
we
left
the
train
at
new
brunswick
and
you
said
it
was
the
only
one
in
the
world
with
a
handle
on
the
end
i
thought
it
was
said
nan
but
it
seems
somebody
else
was
clever
enough
to
have
an
too
and
she
was
a
trained
nurse
apparently
many
of
the
new
have
handles
on
the
end
said
fairfield
though
not
common
as
yet
i
have
seen
a
number
of
them
but
just
imagine
how
the
nurse
feels
who
is
obliged
to
wear
your
dinner
gown
instead
of
her
uniform
i
hope
she
wo
spoil
it
exclaimed
bumble
it
was
that
lovely
light
blue
thing
one
of
the
prettiest
frocks
you
own
i
can
imagine
her
now
said
bob
she
is
probably
bathing
the
brow
of
a
sleepless
patient
and
the
lace
ruffles
and
turquoise
bugles
are
helping
along
a
lot
in
fact
i
think
she
looking
rather
nice
going
around
a
in
that
blue
bombazine
it
is
bombazine
bob
said
his
sister
it
beautiful
lovely
chiffon
well
beautiful
lovely
chiffon
then
but
anyway
sure
the
nurse
is
glad
of
a
chance
to
wear
it
instead
of
her
own
plain
clothes
but
her
own
plain
clothes
are
not
at
all
unpicturesque
and
are
very
becoming
to
miss
allen
said
fairfield
but
have
your
trunks
come
he
added
as
they
all
went
out
to
dinner
no
said
bob
harper
and
i
investigated
the
but
they
were
there
oh
call
him
kenneth
said
patty
you
boys
are
too
young
for
such
formality
i
may
be
said
bob
but
he
is
he
a
college
man
he
a
college
boy
said
patty
he
only
nineteen
and
you
sixteen
yourself
going
on
seventeen
said
bob
proudly
and
so
is
bumble
twins
often
are
the
same
age
observed
fairfield
and
after
a
few
years
bob
you
have
to
be
careful
how
you
announce
your
own
age
because
it
will
reveal
your
sister
pooh
i
do
care
said
bumble
i
just
as
lieve
people
would
know
how
old
i
am
nan
is
and
she
does
care
who
knows
it
you
look
about
fifty
in
those
ridiculous
clothes
said
patty
do
i
said
nan
quite
unconcernedly
i
do
mind
that
a
bit
but
i
do
think
i
can
keep
them
at
this
stage
of
whiteness
for
many
days
can
anything
be
done
to
coax
our
trunks
this
way
we
might
do
some
telephoning
after
dinner
said
fairfield
what
is
the
situation
up
to
the
present
time
why
you
see
it
was
this
way
said
bumble
when
the
carriage
came
to
take
us
to
the
station
the
trunks
were
quite
ready
and
mamma
said
for
us
to
go
on
and
she
finish
packing
them
and
send
them
down
in
time
to
get
that
train
or
the
next
and
did
they
come
for
that
train
no
they
did
and
so
of
course
they
must
have
been
sent
on
the
next
one
but
even
so
they
ought
to
be
here
now
because
you
know
we
went
on
through
and
came
back
but
how
did
you
get
your
checks
if
your
trunks
were
put
on
the
train
oh
the
baggageman
knows
us
explained
bob
and
he
gave
us
our
checks
and
kept
the
duplicates
to
put
on
our
trunks
when
they
came
down
to
the
station
he
often
does
that
yes
said
bumble
we
never
had
our
trunks
ready
yet
when
the
man
came
for
them
nan
was
ready
put
in
bob
who
was
a
great
stickler
for
justice
but
of
course
hers
could
go
till
ours
did
oh
i
guess
they
turn
up
all
right
they
did
turn
up
all
right
hours
later
but
the
exchange
of
was
not
so
easily
effected
however
after
more
or
less
correspondence
between
nan
and
the
nurse
who
owned
the
uniform
the
transfer
was
finally
made
and
nan
recovered
her
pretty
blue
gown
which
certainly
bore
no
evidence
of
having
been
worn
in
a
sickroom
but
i
bet
she
wore
it
all
the
same
said
bob
she
probably
neglected
her
patient
and
went
to
a
party
that
night
just
because
she
had
the
frock
chapter
xxi
a
good
suggestion
august
at
boxley
hall
proved
to
be
a
month
of
fun
and
frolic
the
barlow
cousins
were
much
easier
to
entertain
than
the
clairs
in
fact
they
entertained
themselves
and
as
for
nan
allen
she
entertained
everybody
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
fairfield
expressed
himself
as
being
delighted
to
have
patty
under
the
influence
of
such
a
gracious
and
charming
young
woman
and
aunt
alice
quite
agreed
with
him
marian
adored
nan
and
though
she
liked
bumble
very
much
indeed
she
took
more
real
pleasure
in
the
society
of
the
older
girl
but
they
were
a
congenial
crowd
of
merry
young
people
and
when
hepworth
came
down
from
the
city
as
he
often
did
and
kenneth
harper
drifted
in
from
as
he
very
often
did
the
house
party
at
boxley
hall
waxed
exceeding
merry
and
there
was
no
lack
of
social
entertainment
the
vernondale
young
people
were
quite
ready
to
provide
pleasures
for
patty
guests
and
the
appreciation
shown
by
nan
and
the
barlows
was
a
decided
and
very
pleasant
contrast
to
the
attitude
of
ethelyn
and
reginald
sailing
parties
occurred
often
and
these
nan
enjoyed
especially
for
she
was
passionately
fond
of
the
water
and
dearly
loved
sailing
or
rowing
the
tea
club
girls
all
liked
nan
and
though
she
was
older
than
most
of
them
she
enjoyed
their
meetings
quite
as
much
as
bumble
marian
or
patty
herself
bob
soon
made
friends
with
the
tea
club
annex
as
the
boys
of
set
chose
to
call
themselves
though
not
a
club
of
any
sort
they
were
always
invited
when
the
tea
club
had
anything
special
going
on
and
many
times
when
it
had
one
afternoon
the
tea
club
was
holding
its
weekly
meeting
at
marian
do
you
know
elsie
morris
was
saying
that
the
babies
hospital
is
in
need
of
funds
again
those
infants
are
perfect
gormandisers
i
do
see
how
they
can
eat
so
much
or
wear
so
many
clothes
babies
always
wear
lots
of
clothes
said
lillian
desmond
with
an
air
of
great
wisdom
i
seen
them
they
just
bundle
them
up
in
everything
they
can
find
and
then
wrap
more
things
around
them
well
they
used
up
all
their
wrappings
said
elsie
morris
and
they
want
more
i
met
greenleaf
this
morning
in
the
street
and
she
stopped
me
to
ask
if
we
girls
would
raise
some
more
money
for
them
somehow
oh
dear
said
florence
douglass
they
just
want
us
to
work
all
the
time
for
the
old
hospital
i
tired
of
it
why
florence
said
patty
we
have
done
a
thing
since
we
had
that
play
last
winter
i
think
it
would
be
very
nice
to
have
some
entertainment
or
something
and
make
some
money
for
them
again
we
could
have
some
summery
outdoorsy
kind
of
a
thing
like
a
lawn
party
you
know
yes
said
laura
russell
and
have
it
rain
and
spoil
everything
and
soak
all
the
chinese
lanterns
and
drench
all
the
people
clothes
and
everybody
would
run
into
the
house
and
track
mud
all
over
oh
it
would
be
lovely
what
a
cheerful
view
you
do
take
of
things
laura
said
elsie
morris
now
you
know
it
just
as
likely
not
to
rain
as
to
rain
more
likely
said
nan
it
does
rain
twice
as
often
as
it
rains
now
i
believe
it
would
be
a
beautiful
bright
day
or
moonlight
night
whichever
you
have
the
party
and
nobody
will
get
their
clothes
spoiled
and
the
lanterns
will
burn
lovely
and
you
will
have
a
big
crowd
and
it
would
be
a
howling
success
and
you
make
an
awful
lot
of
money
that
picture
sounds
very
attractive
said
polly
stevens
and
i
say
let
do
it
but
somehow
i
do
like
a
lawn
party
it
so
tame
have
something
real
novel
and
original
nan
you
must
know
of
something
i
do
said
nan
i
stupid
as
an
owl
about
such
things
but
if
you
can
decide
on
something
to
have
i
help
all
i
can
with
it
and
nan
awful
good
help
put
in
bumble
she
works
and
works
and
works
and
never
gets
tired
i
help
too
i
love
to
only
i
not
much
good
we
take
all
the
help
that
offered
said
elsie
morris
of
any
quality
whatsoever
but
what
can
the
show
be
no
amount
of
thinking
or
discussion
seemed
to
suggest
any
novel
enterprise
by
which
a
fortune
could
be
made
at
short
notice
and
at
last
nan
said
i
should
think
patty
that
hepworth
could
help
always
having
queer
sorts
of
performances
in
his
studio
do
you
know
the
mock
art
exhibition
he
told
us
about
oh
yes
said
patty
he
be
sure
to
know
of
something
for
us
to
do
and
i
think
he
coming
out
with
papa
i
ask
him
do
said
elsie
and
tell
him
it
must
be
something
that
heaps
of
fun
and
that
we
all
like
and
that
never
been
done
here
before
all
right
said
patty
anything
else
yes
it
must
be
something
to
appeal
to
the
popular
taste
and
draw
a
big
crowd
so
we
can
make
a
lot
of
money
for
the
babies
very
well
said
patty
i
tell
him
all
that
and
i
sure
suggest
just
the
right
thing
hepworth
did
come
down
that
night
and
when
the
girls
asked
him
for
suggestions
he
very
willingly
began
to
think
up
plans
for
them
i
should
think
you
might
make
a
success
he
said
of
an
entertainment
like
one
i
attended
up
in
the
mountains
last
summer
it
was
called
a
fair
and
was
a
sort
of
burlesque
on
the
county
fairs
or
state
fairs
that
used
to
be
held
annually
and
are
still
i
believe
in
some
sections
of
the
country
it
sounds
all
right
so
far
said
patty
tell
us
more
about
it
well
you
know
you
get
everybody
interested
and
you
have
a
committee
for
all
the
different
parts
of
it
what
are
the
different
parts
of
it
oh
they
the
domestic
department
where
you
exhibit
pies
and
and
done
by
the
ladies
in
charge
of
course
these
exhibits
are
real
you
know
patty
said
her
father
and
you
girls
would
probably
be
tempted
to
put
up
gay
jokes
on
each
other
for
instance
that
rockery
arrangement
of
pansy
might
be
exhibited
as
your
idea
of
art
work
i
would
mind
the
joke
on
myself
papa
said
patty
but
it
might
not
please
pansy
but
we
can
get
plenty
of
things
to
exhibit
in
the
domestic
department
that
will
be
easy
enough
i
borrow
miss
daggett
pumpkin
to
exhibit
as
my
latest
achievement
in
the
line
of
applied
art
and
i
make
a
pie
and
label
it
laura
russell
which
will
take
the
first
prize
but
what
other
departments
are
there
mr
hepworth
well
the
horticulture
department
can
be
made
very
humourous
as
well
as
lucrative
at
this
fair
i
went
to
the
ladies
had
a
beautiful
table
full
of
and
other
gimcracks
in
the
shape
of
fruits
and
vegetables
oh
yes
said
bumble
i
know
how
to
make
those
i
can
make
bananas
and
potatoes
and
nan
can
make
lovely
strawberries
and
i
can
make
paper
flowers
said
bob
honest
i
can
great
big
sunflowers
and
tiger
lilies
and
you
can
use
them
for
lampshades
if
you
like
yes
the
horticulture
booth
will
be
easy
enough
said
nan
i
help
a
lot
with
that
now
what
else
then
you
can
have
an
art
gallery
if
you
like
burlesque
of
course
with
ridiculous
pictures
and
statues
i
know
where
i
can
borrow
a
lot
for
you
in
new
york
gorgeous
cried
patty
clapping
her
hands
what
a
trump
you
are
what
else
a
loan
exhibition
is
of
real
interest
said
hepworth
if
never
had
one
of
those
here
i
think
one
or
two
of
your
members
could
arrange
a
very
effective
little
exhibit
by
borrowing
objects
of
interest
from
their
friends
about
town
i
sure
of
it
said
patty
miss
daggett
has
lovely
things
and
so
has
greenleaf
and
aunt
alice
and
lots
of
people
we
let
florence
douglass
and
lillian
desmond
look
after
that
it
just
in
their
line
and
then
you
must
have
side
shows
you
know
funny
performances
like
and
judy
and
a
gipsy
and
then
all
the
people
who
take
part
in
it
must
wear
fancy
or
grotesque
costumes
and
the
great
feature
of
the
whole
show
is
a
parade
of
these
people
in
their
eccentric
garb
some
walk
while
others
ride
on
decorated
steeds
or
in
queer
vehicles
of
course
there
lots
of
detail
and
lots
of
work
about
it
but
if
you
go
into
the
thing
with
any
sort
of
enthusiasm
i
sure
you
can
make
a
big
success
of
it
they
did
go
into
the
thing
with
all
sorts
of
enthusiasm
and
they
did
make
a
big
success
of
it
the
tea
club
girls
declared
the
scheme
a
fine
one
and
the
boys
annex
announced
themselves
as
ready
to
help
in
any
and
every
possible
way
committees
were
appointed
to
attend
to
the
different
departments
and
as
these
committees
were
carefully
selected
with
a
view
to
giving
each
what
he
or
she
liked
best
to
do
the
whole
work
went
on
harmoniously
the
site
chosen
for
the
county
fair
was
the
old
warner
place
as
this
was
still
unoccupied
it
made
a
most
appropriate
setting
for
the
projected
entertainment
when
hepworth
saw
it
he
declared
it
was
ideal
for
the
purpose
and
immediately
began
to
make
plans
for
utilising
the
different
rooms
of
the
old
house
a
loan
exhibition
was
to
be
held
in
one
and
as
patty
had
foreseen
many
old
relics
and
heirlooms
of
great
interest
were
borrowed
from
willing
lenders
around
town
in
another
room
was
the
domestic
exhibition
and
in
another
the
horticultural
show
was
held
one
room
was
devoted
to
amusing
the
children
and
contained
a
punch
and
judy
show
fish
pond
and
various
games
there
was
a
candy
kitchen
where
cooks
could
make
candy
and
sell
it
to
immediate
purchasers
it
had
been
decided
to
hold
the
fair
during
the
afternoon
and
evening
of
two
consecutive
days
as
nan
had
prophesied
these
days
showed
weather
beyond
all
criticism
not
too
warm
to
be
pleasant
but
with
bright
sunshine
and
a
gentle
breeze
at
three
the
grand
parade
began
and
the
spectators
watched
with
glee
the
grotesque
figures
that
passed
them
in
line
patty
whose
special
department
was
the
candy
kitchen
was
dressed
as
the
queen
of
hearts
who
made
the
renowned
tarts
hepworth
had
designed
her
dress
and
though
it
was
of
simple
white
trimmed
with
hearts
it
was
very
effective
and
becoming
she
wore
a
gilt
crown
and
carried
a
gilt
sceptre
and
rode
in
her
own
little
pony
cart
which
had
been
so
gaily
decorated
for
the
occasion
that
it
was
quite
unrecognisable
kenneth
harper
as
the
knave
of
hearts
who
wickedly
stole
the
tarts
sat
by
her
side
and
drove
the
little
chariot
nan
was
dressed
as
a
gipsy
she
had
a
marvellous
tent
in
which
to
tell
fortunes
and
in
the
parade
she
rode
on
a
donkey
marian
was
a
dame
of
olden
time
and
bumble
was
a
japanese
lady
of
high
degree
there
were
quaint
and
curious
costumes
of
all
sorts
each
of
which
provoked
much
mirth
or
admiration
from
the
enthusiastic
audience
after
the
parade
the
fair
was
announced
open
and
the
patrons
were
requested
to
spend
their
money
freely
for
the
benefit
of
the
hospital
so
well
did
they
respond
that
as
a
result
of
their
efforts
the
tea
club
girls
were
able
to
present
greenleaf
with
the
sum
of
five
hundred
dollars
toward
her
good
work
chapter
xxii
at
the
seashore
toward
the
end
of
august
the
barlows
visit
drew
toward
its
close
although
patty
was
sorry
to
have
her
cousins
go
yet
she
looked
forward
with
a
certain
sense
of
relief
to
being
once
more
alone
with
her
father
it
lovely
to
have
company
she
confided
to
her
aunt
alice
one
day
and
i
do
enjoy
it
ever
so
much
only
somehow
i
get
tired
of
ordering
and
looking
after
things
day
after
day
all
housekeepers
have
that
experience
patty
dear
said
aunt
alice
but
they
usually
older
than
you
before
they
begin
it
is
a
great
deal
of
care
for
a
girl
of
sixteen
and
though
you
get
along
beautifully
sure
it
has
been
rather
a
hard
summer
for
you
so
impressed
was
elliott
with
these
facts
that
she
talked
to
fairfield
about
the
matter
and
advised
him
to
take
patty
away
somewhere
for
a
little
rest
and
change
before
beginning
her
school
year
again
fairfield
agreed
heartily
to
this
plan
expressed
himself
as
willing
to
take
patty
anywhere
and
suggested
that
some
of
the
elliotts
go
too
when
patty
opinion
was
asked
she
said
she
would
be
delighted
to
go
away
for
a
vacation
and
that
she
had
the
place
all
picked
out
well
you
are
an
expeditious
young
woman
said
her
father
and
where
is
it
that
you
want
to
go
why
you
see
papa
the
of
september
when
bob
and
bumble
go
home
from
here
nan
is
going
back
with
them
she
going
down
to
spring
lake
that
a
place
down
on
the
new
jersey
coast
and
i
never
been
there
and
she
says
it
lovely
and
so
i
want
to
go
there
well
i
do
see
any
reason
why
you
should
said
fairfield
it
would
suit
me
well
enough
if
nan
is
willing
we
should
follow
in
her
footsteps
i
delighted
to
have
you
said
nan
who
was
in
a
hammock
at
the
other
end
of
the
veranda
when
this
conclave
was
taking
place
i
wish
we
could
go
with
the
crowd
said
bob
who
was
perched
on
the
veranda
railing
i
wish
so
too
said
bumble
but
wishing
does
do
any
good
after
that
letter
father
wrote
yesterday
i
think
the
best
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
scurry
home
as
fast
as
we
can
so
the
plans
were
made
according
to
patty
wish
and
a
few
days
after
the
barlow
twins
returned
to
their
home
a
merry
party
left
vernondale
for
spring
lake
this
party
consisted
of
and
elliott
and
marian
fairfield
patty
and
nan
they
had
all
arranged
for
rooms
in
the
same
hotel
to
which
nan
was
going
and
where
her
parents
were
awaiting
her
marlborough
house
was
its
name
and
very
attractive
and
comfortable
it
looked
to
the
vernondale
people
as
they
arrived
about
four
one
afternoon
in
early
september
and
allen
proved
to
be
charming
people
who
were
more
than
ready
to
show
any
courtesies
in
their
power
to
the
fairfields
who
had
so
kindly
entertained
nan
although
an
older
couple
than
the
elliotts
they
proved
to
be
congenial
companions
and
after
a
day
or
two
the
whole
party
felt
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
all
their
lives
acquaintances
ripen
easily
at
the
seashore
and
patty
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
was
beginning
what
was
to
be
one
of
the
pleasantest
experiences
of
her
life
and
so
it
proved
although
fairfield
announced
that
patty
had
come
down
for
a
rest
and
that
there
was
to
be
very
little
if
any
gaiety
allowed
yet
somehow
there
was
always
something
pleasant
going
on
every
day
there
was
bathing
and
this
was
a
great
delight
to
patty
the
summer
before
at
her
uncle
home
on
long
island
she
had
learned
to
swim
and
though
it
was
more
difficult
to
swim
in
the
surf
yet
it
was
also
more
fun
nan
was
an
expert
swimmer
and
marian
knew
nothing
of
the
art
but
the
three
girls
enjoyed
splashing
about
in
the
water
and
were
never
quite
ready
to
come
out
when
aunt
alice
or
allen
called
to
them
from
the
beach
in
the
afternoons
there
were
long
walks
or
drives
along
the
shore
and
the
exercise
and
salt
air
soon
restored
to
patty
the
robust
health
and
strength
which
her
father
feared
she
had
lost
during
the
summer
in
the
evening
there
was
dancing
sometimes
hops
but
more
often
informal
dancing
among
the
young
people
staying
at
the
hotel
all
three
of
our
girls
were
fond
of
dancing
and
excelled
in
the
art
but
patty
was
especially
graceful
and
skillful
the
first
saturday
night
after
their
arrival
at
marlborough
house
a
large
dance
was
to
be
held
and
this
was
really
patty
first
experience
at
what
might
be
termed
a
ball
she
was
delighted
with
the
prospect
and
her
father
had
ordered
her
a
beautiful
new
frock
from
new
york
which
proved
to
be
rather
longer
than
any
she
had
as
yet
worn
i
feel
so
grown
up
in
it
she
exclaimed
as
she
tried
it
on
to
show
her
father
i
think
i
have
to
do
up
my
hair
when
i
wear
this
grand
costume
it
does
seem
just
right
to
have
it
tied
up
with
a
little
girl
patty
my
child
i
do
believe
you
growing
up
said
her
father
i
do
believe
i
am
papa
i
almost
seventeen
and
i
taller
than
aunt
alice
now
and
a
lot
taller
than
marian
it
is
only
your
height
child
you
always
were
a
big
girl
but
you
seem
to
be
growing
up
in
other
ways
and
i
do
believe
i
like
it
i
was
glad
when
you
were
no
longer
a
child
but
i
like
to
have
you
a
little
girl
and
i
do
believe
i
care
for
you
a
bit
when
you
a
young
woman
now
is
that
too
bad
said
patty
pinching
her
father
cheek
i
suppose
i
have
to
suit
myself
with
another
father
i
sure
i
live
with
anybody
who
did
like
me
a
bit
well
perhaps
uncle
charley
will
adopt
me
he
seems
to
like
me
at
any
age
oh
i
try
and
put
up
with
you
said
her
father
kissing
her
and
meantime
what
this
talk
about
piling
up
your
hair
on
top
of
your
head
is
it
really
absolutely
necessary
to
do
so
if
you
wear
this
frippery
confection
of
oh
not
necessary
perhaps
but
i
think
it
would
look
better
at
any
rate
i
just
try
it
well
you
do
seem
to
be
standing
with
very
feet
said
her
father
i
believe
you
rather
anxious
to
grow
up
after
all
but
run
along
chicken
and
dress
your
hair
any
way
you
please
i
want
you
to
have
a
good
time
at
your
first
ball
as
frank
elliott
and
kenneth
harper
and
hepworth
came
down
to
spring
lake
to
stay
over
sunday
the
party
of
friends
at
marlborough
house
was
considerably
augmented
when
the
young
men
arrived
the
girls
were
lazily
basking
on
the
sand
and
nan
was
pretending
to
read
a
book
to
the
other
two
only
pretending
however
for
patty
kept
interrupting
her
with
nonsensical
remarks
and
marian
teased
her
by
slowly
sifting
sand
through
her
fingers
onto
the
pages
of
the
book
i
might
as
well
try
to
read
to
a
tribe
of
wild
indians
as
to
you
two
girls
said
nan
at
last
do
you
your
minds
improved
do
you
think
our
superior
minds
be
improved
by
that
trash
reading
said
patty
i
really
think
some
of
your
instructive
conversation
would
benefit
us
more
greatly
you
an
ungrateful
pair
said
nan
and
you
do
deserve
that
i
should
waste
my
valuable
conversation
upon
you
and
you
do
deserve
either
that
i
should
tell
you
to
turn
your
heads
around
to
see
coming
but
i
will
her
hearers
looked
round
quickly
and
saw
three
familiar
figures
coming
along
the
board
walk
goody
cried
patty
and
scrambling
to
her
feet
she
ran
with
outstretched
hands
to
meet
them
she
did
look
very
grown
up
then
in
her
beach
dress
and
her
hair
in
a
long
thick
braid
down
her
back
and
curling
round
her
temples
in
windblown
locks
but
to
hepworth
artist
eye
she
looked
more
beautiful
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
kenneth
harper
too
looked
admiringly
at
the
graceful
figure
flying
toward
them
across
the
sand
but
frank
shouted
hello
patty
do
break
your
neck
we
coming
down
there
where
marian
she
right
here
answered
patty
we
all
right
here
your
up
on
the
veranda
oh
i
so
glad
to
see
you
this
is
the
loveliest
place
and
we
having
the
beautifullest
time
and
now
that
you
boys
have
come
it
will
be
better
than
ever
and
there
going
to
be
a
hop
tonight
is
that
gay
oh
how
do
you
do
mr
hepworth
though
patty
manner
took
on
a
shade
more
of
dignity
in
addressing
the
older
man
it
lost
nothing
in
cordiality
and
he
responded
with
words
of
glad
greeting
hearing
the
laughter
and
excitement
aunt
alice
and
allen
came
down
from
the
veranda
to
sit
on
the
sand
by
the
young
people
soon
fairfield
and
allen
and
elliott
returning
from
a
stroll
joined
the
party
the
newcomers
produced
divers
and
sundry
parcels
which
they
turned
over
to
the
ladies
and
which
proved
to
contain
various
new
books
and
magazines
and
delicious
candies
and
fruits
it
just
like
christmas
exclaimed
patty
i
do
love
to
have
things
brought
to
me
you
certainly
in
your
element
now
then
said
fairfield
looking
at
his
daughter
who
sat
with
a
fig
in
one
hand
and
a
chocolate
in
the
other
trying
to
open
a
book
with
her
elbows
i
certainly
am
she
responded
the
only
flaw
is
that
i
suppose
about
time
to
go
in
to
dinner
i
wish
we
could
all
sit
here
on
the
sand
forever
you
change
your
mind
when
you
reached
my
age
said
allen
quite
ready
to
go
in
now
and
find
a
more
comfortable
chair
later
that
evening
patty
completely
arrayed
for
the
dance
came
to
her
father
for
inspection
you
look
very
sweet
my
child
he
said
after
gazing
at
her
long
and
earnestly
and
with
your
hair
dressed
that
way
you
look
very
much
like
your
mother
i
sorry
you
growing
up
my
baby
i
certainly
am
but
i
suppose
it
ca
be
helped
unless
the
world
stops
turning
around
and
if
it
any
satisfaction
to
you
i
like
to
have
you
know
that
your
father
thinks
you
the
prettiest
and
sweetest
girl
in
all
the
country
round
and
are
you
going
to
tell
me
that
if
i
only
behave
as
well
as
i
look
i
do
very
nicely
you
seem
to
know
that
already
so
i
hardly
think
it
necessary
well
i
tell
it
to
you
then
for
you
do
look
so
beautiful
in
evening
clothes
that
i
do
believe
you
behave
as
well
as
you
look
nobody
could
i
see
your
growing
up
has
taught
you
flattery
said
her
father
a
habit
you
must
try
to
overcome
but
patty
was
already
dancing
down
the
long
hall
to
aunt
alice
room
and
a
few
moments
later
they
all
went
down
to
the
parlours
when
kenneth
first
saw
patty
that
evening
he
stood
looking
at
her
with
a
funny
stupefied
expression
on
his
face
what
the
matter
said
patty
laughing
just
because
i
wearing
a
few
extra
hairpins
you
need
look
as
if
you
lost
your
last
friend
i
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
call
you
miss
fairfield
well
call
me
that
if
you
like
i
do
mind
call
me
miss
smith
or
miss
brown
if
you
want
to
i
do
care
what
you
call
me
if
you
only
ask
me
to
dance
come
on
then
said
kenneth
and
in
a
moment
they
were
whirling
in
the
waltz
and
the
boy
momentary
embarrassment
was
entirely
forgotten
chapter
xxiii
ambitions
there
said
kenneth
after
the
dance
was
over
you
look
more
like
your
old
self
now
i
have
lost
any
hairpins
have
i
said
patty
putting
up
her
hands
to
her
fluffy
topknot
no
but
you
lost
that
absurd
look
i
getting
used
to
my
new
frock
do
you
like
it
yes
of
course
i
do
i
like
everything
you
wear
because
i
like
you
in
fact
i
think
i
like
you
better
than
any
girl
i
ever
saw
kenneth
said
this
in
such
a
frank
boyish
way
that
he
seemed
to
be
announcing
a
mere
casual
preference
for
some
thing
at
least
it
seemed
so
to
patty
and
she
answered
carelessly
you
you
do
i
like
you
to
be
sure
of
it
sir
i
am
sure
of
it
said
ken
and
then
a
little
more
diffidently
do
you
like
me
best
why
yes
of
course
i
do
said
patty
smiling
that
is
after
papa
and
aunt
alice
and
marian
and
uncle
charley
and
frank
and
mancy
and
pansy
and
mr
hepworth
patty
might
not
have
added
the
last
name
if
she
had
not
just
then
seen
that
gentleman
coming
toward
her
he
looked
at
patty
with
an
especial
kindliness
in
his
eyes
and
said
gently
miss
fairfield
may
i
see
your
card
patty
flushed
a
little
and
her
eyes
fell
please
do
talk
like
that
she
said
i
not
grown
up
if
i
am
dressed
up
i
only
patty
and
if
you
call
me
anything
else
run
away
do
run
away
said
hepworth
still
looking
at
her
with
that
grave
kindliness
that
seemed
to
have
about
it
a
touch
of
sadness
i
will
call
you
patty
as
long
as
you
will
stay
with
me
then
patty
smiled
again
quite
her
own
merry
little
self
and
gave
him
her
card
saying
put
your
name
down
a
lot
of
times
please
you
are
a
beautiful
dancer
and
i
like
best
to
dance
with
the
people
i
know
best
i
wish
i
had
a
rubber
stamp
said
hepworth
it
very
fatiguing
to
write
one
name
on
every
line
oh
good
gracious
cried
patty
do
take
them
all
i
want
to
save
a
lot
for
frank
and
ken
and
your
father
said
hepworth
papa
he
does
dance
at
least
i
never
saw
him
but
he
did
dance
that
last
waltz
with
miss
allen
with
nan
well
then
i
rather
think
he
can
dance
with
his
own
daughter
do
take
any
more
i
want
all
the
rest
for
him
and
please
take
me
to
him
here
he
comes
now
fairfield
your
daughter
wishes
a
word
with
you
papa
fairfield
exclaimed
patty
you
never
told
me
you
could
dance
you
never
asked
me
you
took
it
for
granted
that
i
was
too
old
to
frisk
around
the
ballroom
and
are
you
asked
patty
teasingly
try
me
and
see
said
her
father
as
he
took
her
card
the
trial
proved
very
satisfactory
and
patty
declared
that
she
must
have
inherited
her
own
taste
for
dancing
from
her
father
the
evening
passed
all
too
swiftly
pretty
patty
with
her
merry
ways
and
graceful
manners
was
a
real
belle
and
aunt
alice
was
besieged
by
requests
for
introductions
to
her
niece
and
daughter
but
marian
though
a
sweet
and
charming
girl
had
a
certain
shyness
which
always
kept
her
from
becoming
an
immediate
favourite
patty
absolute
lack
of
and
her
ready
friendliness
made
her
popular
at
once
fairfield
and
nan
allen
were
speaking
of
this
as
they
stood
out
on
the
veranda
and
looked
at
patty
through
the
window
she
the
most
perfect
combination
miss
allen
was
saying
of
the
child
and
the
girl
she
has
none
of
the
silly
affectations
of
and
yet
she
has
in
her
nature
all
the
elements
that
go
to
make
a
wise
and
sensible
woman
i
think
you
right
said
fairfield
as
he
looked
fondly
at
his
daughter
she
is
growing
up
just
as
i
want
her
to
and
developing
the
traits
i
most
want
her
to
possess
a
frank
simplicity
of
manner
a
happy
disposition
and
a
gentle
unselfish
soul
meantime
patty
and
hepworth
were
sitting
on
the
stairs
now
my
cup
of
happiness
is
full
remarked
patty
i
have
always
thought
it
must
be
perfect
bliss
to
sit
on
the
stairs
at
a
party
i
do
know
why
i
sure
but
all
the
information
i
have
gathered
from
art
and
literature
have
led
me
to
consider
it
the
height
of
earthly
joy
and
is
it
proving
all
your
fancy
painted
it
asked
hepworth
who
was
sitting
a
step
below
yes
that
is
it
almost
perfect
and
what
is
the
lacking
element
oh
i
would
like
to
tell
you
said
patty
and
hepworth
was
not
quite
certain
whether
her
confusion
were
real
or
simulated
may
i
guess
he
asked
yes
if
you
promise
not
to
guess
true
said
patty
if
you
did
i
should
be
overcome
with
blushing
embarrassment
but
i
am
going
to
guess
and
if
i
guess
true
i
will
promise
to
go
and
bring
you
the
element
that
will
complete
your
happiness
that
sounds
so
tempting
said
patty
that
now
i
hope
you
guess
true
what
is
the
missing
joy
kenneth
harper
said
hepworth
looking
at
patty
curiously
without
a
trace
of
a
blush
patty
broke
into
gay
laughter
oh
you
are
ridiculous
she
said
i
have
here
why
should
i
want
him
then
what
is
it
you
do
want
and
hepworth
looked
away
as
he
evaded
her
question
since
you
make
me
confess
my
very
prosaic
desires
i
own
up
that
like
a
strawberry
ice
well
that
just
what
i
dying
for
myself
said
hepworth
gaily
and
if
you
reserve
this
orchestra
chair
for
me
i
go
and
forage
for
it
it
looks
almost
impossible
to
get
through
that
crowd
but
return
either
with
my
shield
or
on
it
unless
you
rather
i
send
harper
back
with
the
ice
do
just
as
you
please
said
patty
with
a
sudden
touch
of
coquetry
in
her
smiling
eyes
it
does
matter
a
bit
to
me
but
though
a
willing
messenger
hepworth
found
it
impossible
to
accomplish
his
errand
with
any
degree
of
rapidity
and
when
he
returned
successful
but
tardy
he
found
young
harper
waiting
where
he
had
left
patty
she
gone
off
to
dance
with
frank
elliott
explained
the
boy
cheerfully
and
she
said
you
and
i
could
divide
the
ices
between
us
all
right
said
the
artist
here
your
share
the
next
morning
patty
nan
and
marian
went
down
to
the
beach
for
a
quiet
chat
let
shake
everybody
said
patty
and
just
go
off
by
ourselves
tired
of
a
lot
of
people
you
becoming
such
a
belle
patty
said
nan
that
i
afraid
be
bothered
with
a
lot
of
people
the
rest
of
your
life
no
i
wo
said
patty
lots
of
people
are
all
very
well
when
you
want
them
but
i
going
to
cultivate
a
talent
for
getting
rid
of
them
when
you
do
want
them
can
you
cultivate
a
talent
if
you
have
only
a
taste
to
start
with
said
marian
with
more
seriousness
than
patty
careless
remark
seemed
to
call
for
if
you
have
the
least
little
scrap
of
a
of
taste
and
plenty
of
you
can
cultivate
all
the
talents
you
want
said
patty
with
the
air
of
an
oracle
why
what
do
you
want
to
do
now
marian
marian
ambitions
were
a
good
deal
of
a
joke
in
the
elliott
family
at
one
time
she
had
determined
to
become
a
musician
and
had
spent
unsuccessfully
many
hours
and
much
money
in
her
endeavours
but
at
last
she
was
obliged
to
admit
that
her
talents
did
not
lie
in
that
direction
later
on
she
had
tried
painting
and
notwithstanding
discouraging
results
she
had
felt
sure
of
her
artistic
ability
for
a
long
time
until
at
last
she
had
proved
to
her
own
satisfaction
that
she
was
not
meant
to
make
pictures
and
now
when
she
asked
the
above
question
in
a
serious
tone
patty
felt
sure
that
some
new
scheme
was
fermenting
in
her
cousin
brain
what
up
marian
she
said
out
with
it
and
we
promise
to
help
you
if
it
only
by
wise
discouragement
i
think
said
marian
unmoved
by
her
cousin
attitude
i
think
i
should
like
to
be
an
author
do
said
patty
that
the
best
line
you
struck
yet
because
the
cheapest
you
see
nan
when
marian
goes
in
for
painting
and
sculpture
and
music
her
whims
cost
uncle
charley
fabulous
sums
of
money
but
this
new
scheme
is
great
the
outlay
for
a
fountain
pen
and
a
few
sheets
of
stamps
ca
be
so
very
much
and
the
scheme
will
keep
you
out
of
other
mischief
all
winter
it
does
sound
attractive
said
nan
tell
us
more
about
it
are
you
going
to
write
books
or
stories
books
said
marian
calmly
lovely
cried
patty
do
two
at
once
wo
you
so
you
can
dedicate
one
to
nan
and
one
to
me
at
the
same
time
i
wo
share
my
dedication
with
anybody
you
can
laugh
all
you
like
said
marian
i
do
mind
a
speck
for
sure
i
can
do
it
i
been
talking
to
miss
fischer
she
written
lots
of
books
you
know
and
stories
too
and
she
says
it
awfully
easy
if
you
have
a
taste
for
it
of
course
it
is
said
patty
that
just
what
i
told
you
if
you
have
a
taste
good
taste
you
know
and
plenty
of
and
stamps
you
can
write
anything
you
want
to
and
i
believe
you
do
it
go
in
and
win
marian
you
can
put
me
in
your
book
if
you
want
to
willpower
is
everything
patty
said
nan
whose
face
had
assumed
a
curious
and
somewhat
wistful
look
at
least
it
may
be
in
literature
but
it
wo
do
all
i
want
it
to
what
do
you
want
girlie
said
patty
i
never
knew
you
had
an
ungratified
ambition
gnawing
at
your
well
i
have
i
want
to
be
a
singer
you
do
sing
beautifully
said
marian
i
heard
you
yes
but
i
mean
a
great
singer
on
the
stage
inquired
patty
yes
or
in
concerts
i
do
care
where
but
i
mean
to
sing
wonderfully
to
sing
as
i
feel
i
could
sing
if
i
had
the
opportunity
you
mean
a
musical
education
and
foreign
study
and
all
those
things
said
patty
yes
said
nan
but
after
all
that
you
might
fail
said
marian
remembering
her
own
experiences
yes
i
might
and
probably
i
should
it
only
a
dream
you
know
but
we
were
talking
about
ambitions
and
that
mine
and
ca
you
accomplish
it
i
do
see
how
i
can
my
parents
are
very
much
opposed
to
it
they
hate
anything
like
a
public
career
and
they
think
i
sing
quite
well
enough
now
without
further
instructions
i
think
so
too
said
patty
i
rather
hear
you
sing
those
quaint
little
songs
of
yours
than
to
hear
the
most
elaborate
trills
and
frills
that
any
prima
donna
ever
accomplished
your
opinion
is
worth
a
great
deal
to
me
patty
as
a
friend
but
technically
i
ca
value
it
so
highly
of
course
i
do
know
much
about
music
said
patty
quite
unabashed
but
papa
thinks
so
too
he
said
your
voice
is
the
sweetest
voice
he
ever
heard
did
he
said
nan
what
is
your
ambition
patty
said
marian
after
a
moment
pause
nan
and
i
have
expressed
ourselves
so
frankly
you
might
tell
us
yours
my
ambition
said
patty
why
i
never
thought
of
it
before
but
i
do
believe
i
have
any
i
feel
rather
ashamed
for
i
suppose
every
properly
equipped
young
woman
ought
to
have
at
least
one
ambition
and
i
do
seem
to
have
a
shadow
of
one
really
great
ones
i
mean
of
course
i
can
sing
a
little
not
much
but
it
seems
to
be
enough
for
me
and
i
can
play
a
little
on
the
piano
and
on
the
banjo
and
i
suppose
shocking
but
really
i
do
care
to
play
any
better
than
i
do
i
paint
and
i
ca
write
stories
but
i
do
want
to
do
either
you
can
keep
house
said
marian
patty
eyes
lighted
up
yes
she
said
is
it
ridiculous
but
i
do
really
believe
that
my
ambition
to
keep
house
just
perfectly
you
know
and
have
everything
go
not
only
smoothly
but
happily
you
ought
to
have
been
a
of
the
fourteenth
century
said
nan
yes
said
patty
eagerly
that
just
my
ambition
what
a
pity
looking
backward
instead
of
forward
but
i
would
love
to
live
in
a
great
stone
castle
all
my
own
with
a
moat
and
drawbridge
and
outriders
and
go
around
in
a
damask
gown
with
a
pointed
bodice
and
big
puffy
sleeves
and
a
ruff
and
a
little
cap
with
pearls
on
it
and
a
bunch
of
keys
jingling
at
my
side
they
usually
carry
the
keys
in
a
basket
observed
marian
and
you
forgot
to
mention
the
falcon
on
your
wrist
so
i
did
said
patty
but
i
think
the
falcon
would
be
a
regular
nuisance
while
i
was
housekeeping
so
i
put
him
in
the
basket
and
set
it
up
on
the
mantelpiece
and
keep
my
keys
jingling
from
my
belt
well
it
seems
said
nan
that
patty
has
more
hopes
of
realising
her
ambition
than
either
of
us
speak
for
yourself
said
marian
i
think
i
have
said
patty
i
have
all
the
keys
i
want
and
i
quite
sure
papa
would
buy
me
a
falcon
if
i
asked
him
to
chapter
xxiv
an
afternoon
drive
the
next
saturday
fairfield
proposed
that
they
all
go
for
a
drive
to
allaire
what
allaire
said
patty
it
a
deserted
village
replied
her
father
the
houses
are
empty
the
old
mill
is
silent
the
streets
are
overgrown
in
fact
it
nothing
but
a
picturesque
ruin
of
a
once
busy
hamlet
they
say
it
a
lovely
drive
said
nan
i
always
wanted
to
go
there
the
boys
will
be
down
by
noon
said
elliott
and
we
can
get
off
soon
after
luncheon
do
you
suppose
fred
we
can
get
conveyances
enough
for
our
large
and
flourishing
family
we
can
try
said
fairfield
i
go
over
to
the
stables
now
and
see
what
i
can
secure
on
his
return
he
found
that
hepworth
kenneth
and
frank
had
arrived
well
saturday
children
he
said
i
glad
to
see
you
i
always
know
it
the
last
day
of
the
week
when
this
illustrious
trio
bursts
upon
my
vision
we
awfully
glad
to
burst
said
frank
and
we
hope
your
vision
can
stand
it
oh
yes
said
fairfield
the
sight
of
you
is
good
for
the
eyes
and
now
i
tell
you
the
plans
for
the
afternoon
what
luck
did
you
have
with
the
carriages
papa
asked
impatient
patty
that
what
i
about
to
tell
you
my
child
if
you
give
me
half
a
chance
i
secured
four
safe
and
more
or
less
commodious
vehicles
four
exclaimed
marian
we
be
a
regular
parade
shall
we
have
a
band
asked
nan
of
course
said
kenneth
and
a
corps
besides
you
wo
need
that
said
patty
for
there
be
no
i
left
behind
me
we
all
going
of
course
we
all
going
said
and
as
we
shall
have
one
extra
seat
you
can
invite
some
girl
who
otherwise
would
be
left
behind
if
frank
does
mind
said
patty
with
a
mischievous
glance
at
her
cousin
i
like
to
ask
miss
kitty
nelson
they
all
laughed
for
frank
admiration
for
the
charming
kitty
was
an
open
secret
frank
blushed
a
little
but
he
held
his
own
and
said
are
they
all
double
carriages
uncle
fred
no
my
boy
there
are
two
traps
and
two
victorias
all
right
then
i
take
one
of
the
traps
and
drive
miss
nelson
bravo
boy
if
you
do
see
what
you
want
ask
for
it
miss
allen
will
you
trust
yourself
to
me
in
the
other
trap
with
great
pleasure
fairfield
replied
nan
and
please
appreciate
my
amiability
for
i
think
they
most
jolty
and
uncomfortable
things
to
ride
in
i
speak
for
a
seat
in
one
of
the
victorias
said
aunt
alice
and
i
think
it
wise
to
get
my
claim
in
quickly
as
the
bids
are
being
made
so
rapidly
i
do
care
how
i
go
said
patty
or
what
i
go
in
i
so
amiable
a
child
can
play
with
me
i
go
in
a
wheelbarrow
if
necessary
i
had
hoped
to
drive
you
over
myself
said
hepworth
who
sat
next
to
her
speaking
in
a
low
tone
but
i
push
you
in
a
wheelbarrow
if
you
prefer
you
go
with
me
patty
in
one
of
the
traps
wo
you
said
kenneth
who
sat
on
the
veranda
railing
at
her
other
side
patty
face
took
on
a
comical
smile
of
amusement
at
these
two
requests
but
she
answered
both
at
once
by
merrily
saying
then
it
all
adjusts
itself
and
allen
and
and
elliott
shall
have
the
most
comfortable
carriage
and
marian
and
hepworth
and
ken
and
i
will
go
in
the
other
that
seemed
to
be
the
best
possible
arrangement
and
about
three
the
procession
started
patty
and
marian
took
the
back
seat
of
the
open
carriage
hepworth
and
kenneth
harper
sat
facing
them
as
marian
had
already
become
very
much
interested
in
her
new
fad
of
authorship
and
as
under
miss
fischer
tuition
she
was
rapidly
developing
into
a
real
little
it
is
not
strange
that
the
conversation
turned
in
that
direction
i
looked
in
all
the
bookshops
in
the
city
for
your
latest
works
miss
marian
said
hepworth
but
they
must
have
been
all
sold
out
for
i
could
find
any
too
bad
said
marian
i
afraid
you
have
to
wait
until
a
new
edition
is
printed
you
not
to
tease
marian
said
patty
reprovingly
she
been
as
patient
as
an
angel
under
a
perfect
storm
of
chaff
and
i
not
going
to
allow
any
more
of
it
i
do
mind
said
marian
i
think
if
one
is
really
in
earnest
one
ought
to
be
annoyed
by
fun
quite
right
said
kenneth
and
ambition
if
it
worth
anything
ought
to
rise
above
comment
of
any
sort
it
ought
to
be
strengthened
by
comment
of
any
sort
said
hepworth
of
any
sort
asked
marian
thoughtfully
yes
for
comment
always
implies
recognition
and
that
in
itself
means
progress
have
you
an
ambition
mr
hepworth
said
patty
suddenly
but
you
have
already
achieved
yours
you
are
a
successful
artist
a
man
may
have
more
than
one
ambition
said
hepworth
slowly
and
i
have
achieved
my
dearest
one
i
suppose
you
want
to
paint
even
better
than
you
do
said
patty
yes
said
the
artist
smiling
a
little
i
hope
i
shall
always
want
to
paint
better
than
i
do
what
your
ambition
harper
to
build
bridges
said
kenneth
i
going
to
be
a
civil
engineer
but
my
ambition
is
to
be
a
and
i
get
there
yet
he
added
with
a
determined
nod
of
his
head
i
think
you
will
said
hepworth
and
i
sure
i
hope
so
then
the
talk
turned
to
lighter
themes
than
ambition
and
merry
laughter
and
jest
filled
up
the
miles
to
allaire
all
were
delighted
with
the
place
aside
from
the
picturesque
ruined
buildings
and
the
eerie
old
mill
there
was
a
novel
interest
in
the
strange
silent
air
of
desertion
that
seemed
to
invest
the
place
with
an
almost
palpable
loneliness
i
do
like
it
said
patty
come
on
let
go
home
but
to
marian
more
romantic
imagination
it
all
seemed
most
attractive
so
different
was
her
temperament
from
that
of
her
sunshiny
cousin
at
last
they
did
go
home
and
patty
chattered
gaily
all
the
way
in
order
as
she
said
to
drive
away
the
musty
recollections
of
that
forlorn
old
place
how
did
you
like
it
nan
she
asked
when
they
were
all
back
at
the
hotel
i
thought
it
beautiful
said
nan
smiling
that
evening
there
was
a
small
informal
dance
in
the
parlours
not
a
large
hop
like
the
one
given
the
week
before
but
patty
declared
the
small
affair
was
just
as
much
fun
as
the
other
i
always
have
all
the
fun
i
can
possibly
hold
anyway
she
said
and
what
more
can
anybody
have
toward
the
close
of
the
evening
fairfield
came
up
to
patty
who
was
sitting
with
a
crowd
of
merry
young
people
in
a
cosey
corner
of
the
veranda
patty
he
said
do
you
want
to
come
for
a
little
stroll
on
the
board
walk
yes
of
course
i
do
said
patty
wondering
a
little
but
always
ready
to
go
with
her
father
is
nan
going
no
i
just
want
you
said
fairfield
all
right
said
patty
i
glad
to
go
they
joined
the
crowd
of
promenaders
on
the
board
walk
and
as
they
passed
patty
favourite
bit
of
beach
she
said
that
where
we
girls
sit
and
talk
about
our
ambitions
yes
so
i
heard
said
fairfield
and
what
are
your
ambitions
baby
oh
mine
are
half
so
grand
and
gorgeous
as
the
other
girls
they
want
to
do
great
things
like
singing
in
grand
opera
and
writing
immortal
books
and
things
like
that
and
your
modest
ambition
is
to
be
a
good
housekeeper
is
it
well
yes
papa
but
not
only
that
i
was
thinking
about
it
afterward
by
myself
and
i
think
that
the
housekeeping
is
the
practical
part
of
it
and
that
a
good
big
part
too
but
what
i
really
want
to
be
is
a
lovely
good
woman
like
aunt
alice
you
know
i
do
believe
she
ever
wanted
to
write
books
or
paint
pictures
no
she
never
did
said
fairfield
and
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
her
ambitions
are
just
as
high
and
noble
as
those
others
you
mentioned
well
i
glad
you
think
so
papa
for
i
was
afraid
i
might
seem
to
you
very
small
and
petty
to
have
all
my
ambitions
bounded
by
the
four
walls
of
my
own
home
no
patty
girl
i
think
those
are
far
better
than
unbounded
ambitions
far
more
easily
realised
and
will
bring
you
greater
and
better
happiness
but
do
you
see
my
child
that
the
very
fact
of
your
having
a
talent
which
you
certainly
have
for
housekeeping
and
implies
that
some
day
in
the
far
future
i
hope
you
will
go
away
from
me
and
make
a
home
of
your
own
very
likely
i
shall
papa
but
that
so
far
in
the
future
that
it
not
worth
while
bothering
about
it
now
but
i
going
to
bother
about
it
now
to
a
certain
extent
do
you
realise
that
when
this
does
come
to
pass
be
it
ever
so
far
hence
that
you
going
to
leave
your
poor
old
father
all
alone
and
that
too
after
i
have
so
carefully
brought
you
up
for
the
express
purpose
of
making
a
home
for
me
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
said
patty
who
was
by
no
means
taking
her
father
remarks
seriously
do
why
i
going
to
do
just
this
i
going
to
get
somebody
else
to
keep
my
house
for
me
and
i
going
to
get
her
now
so
that
i
have
her
ready
against
the
time
you
leave
me
patty
turned
and
by
the
light
of
an
electric
lamp
which
they
were
passing
saw
the
smile
on
her
father
face
and
with
a
sudden
intuition
she
exclaimed
nan
yes
replied
her
father
nan
how
do
you
like
it
like
it
exclaimed
patty
i
it
i
think
it
perfectly
gorgeous
i
just
as
delighted
as
i
can
be
how
does
nan
like
it
she
seems
delighted
too
said
fairfield
smiling
the
end
