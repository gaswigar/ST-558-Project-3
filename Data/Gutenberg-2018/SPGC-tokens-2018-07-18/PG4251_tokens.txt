prologue
in
the
gospels
of
the
only
divine
friend
this
world
has
ever
had
or
ever
will
have
we
read
of
a
voice
a
in
the
wilderness
there
have
been
thousands
of
such
voices
most
of
them
ineffectual
all
through
the
world
history
their
echoes
form
a
part
of
the
universal
record
and
from
the
very
beginning
of
time
they
have
sounded
forth
their
warnings
or
entreaties
in
vain
the
wilderness
has
never
cared
to
hear
them
the
wilderness
does
not
care
to
hear
them
now
why
then
do
i
add
an
undesired
note
to
the
chorus
of
rejected
appeal
how
dare
i
lift
up
my
voice
in
the
wilderness
when
other
voices
far
stronger
and
sweeter
are
drowned
in
the
laughter
of
fools
and
the
mockery
of
the
profane
truly
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
sure
that
i
am
not
moved
by
egotism
or
arrogance
it
is
simply
out
of
love
and
pity
for
suffering
human
kind
that
i
venture
to
become
another
voice
discarded
a
voice
which
if
heard
at
all
may
only
serve
to
awaken
the
cheap
scorn
and
derision
of
the
clowns
of
the
piece
yet
should
this
be
so
i
would
not
have
it
otherwise
i
have
never
at
any
time
striven
to
be
one
with
the
world
or
to
suit
my
speech
pliantly
to
the
conventional
humour
of
the
moment
i
am
often
attacked
yet
am
not
hurt
i
am
equally
often
praised
and
am
not
elated
i
have
no
time
to
attend
to
the
expression
of
opinions
which
whether
good
or
bad
are
to
me
indifferent
and
whatever
pain
i
have
felt
or
feel
in
experiencing
human
malice
has
been
and
is
in
the
fact
that
human
malice
should
exist
at
all
not
for
its
attempted
wrong
towards
myself
for
i
personally
speaking
have
not
a
moment
to
waste
among
the
mere
shadows
of
life
which
are
not
life
itself
i
follow
the
glory
not
the
gloom
so
whether
you
who
wander
in
darkness
of
your
own
making
care
to
come
towards
the
little
light
which
leads
me
onward
or
whether
you
prefer
to
turn
away
from
me
altogether
into
your
darker
depths
is
not
my
concern
i
can
not
force
you
to
bear
me
company
god
himself
can
not
do
that
for
it
is
his
will
and
law
that
each
human
soul
shall
shape
its
own
eternal
future
no
one
mortal
can
make
the
happiness
or
salvation
of
another
i
like
yourselves
am
in
the
but
i
know
that
there
are
ways
of
making
it
blossom
like
the
rose
yet
were
all
my
heart
and
all
my
love
outpoured
upon
you
i
could
not
teach
you
the
divine
transfiguring
charm
unless
you
equally
with
all
your
hearts
and
all
your
love
resolutely
and
irrevocably
willed
to
learn
nevertheless
despite
your
possible
indifference
your
often
sheer
inertia
i
can
not
pass
you
by
having
peace
and
comfort
for
myself
without
at
least
offering
to
share
that
peace
and
comfort
with
you
many
of
you
are
very
sad
and
i
would
rather
you
were
happy
your
ways
of
living
are
trivial
and
unsatisfactory
your
vices
lead
you
into
unforeseen
painful
perplexities
your
ideals
of
what
may
be
best
for
your
own
enjoyment
and
advancement
fall
far
short
of
your
dreams
your
amusements
pall
on
your
senses
your
youth
hurries
away
like
a
puff
of
thistledown
on
the
wind
and
you
spend
all
your
time
feverishly
in
trying
to
live
without
understanding
life
life
the
first
of
all
things
the
essence
of
all
things
life
which
is
yours
to
hold
and
to
keep
and
to
over
and
over
again
in
your
own
persons
this
precious
jewel
you
throw
away
and
when
it
falls
out
of
your
possession
by
your
own
act
you
think
such
an
end
was
necessary
and
inevitable
poor
unhappy
mortals
so
so
proud
so
ignorant
like
some
foolish
rustic
who
finding
a
diamond
sees
no
difference
between
it
and
a
bit
of
glass
you
with
the
whole
universe
sweeping
around
you
in
mighty
beneficent
circles
of
defensive
protective
and
ever
power
power
which
is
yours
to
use
and
to
control
imagine
that
the
entire
cosmos
is
the
design
of
mere
blind
unintelligent
chance
and
that
the
divine
life
which
thrills
within
you
serves
no
purpose
save
to
lead
you
to
death
most
wonderful
and
most
pitiful
it
is
that
such
folly
such
blasphemy
should
still
prevail
and
that
humanity
should
still
ascribe
to
the
almighty
creator
less
wisdom
and
less
love
than
that
with
which
he
has
endowed
his
creatures
for
the
very
first
lesson
in
the
beginning
of
knowledge
is
that
life
is
the
essential
being
of
god
and
that
each
individual
intelligent
outcome
of
life
is
deathless
as
god
himself
the
is
wide
and
within
it
we
all
find
ourselves
some
wandering
far
astray
some
crouching
listlessly
among
shadows
too
weary
to
move
at
all
others
sauntering
along
in
idle
indifference
now
and
then
vaguely
questioning
how
soon
and
where
the
journey
will
end
and
few
ever
discovering
that
it
is
not
a
at
all
but
a
garden
of
sweet
sights
and
sounds
where
every
day
should
be
a
glory
and
every
night
a
benediction
for
when
the
veil
of
mere
appearances
has
been
lifted
we
are
no
longer
deceived
into
accepting
what
seems
for
what
is
the
reality
of
life
is
happiness
the
delusion
of
life
which
we
ourselves
create
by
improper
balance
and
imperfect
comprehension
of
our
own
powers
must
needs
cause
sorrow
because
in
such
we
only
dimly
see
the
truth
just
as
a
person
born
blind
may
vaguely
guess
at
the
beauty
of
bright
day
but
for
the
soul
that
has
found
itself
there
are
no
more
misleading
lights
or
shadows
between
its
own
everlastingness
and
the
everlastingness
of
god
all
the
world
over
there
are
religions
of
various
kinds
more
or
less
suited
to
the
various
types
and
races
of
humanity
most
of
these
forms
of
faith
have
been
evolved
from
the
brooding
brain
of
man
himself
and
have
nothing
in
them
in
the
very
early
ages
nearly
all
the
religious
creeds
were
mere
methods
for
terrorising
the
ignorant
and
the
weak
and
some
of
them
were
so
revolting
so
bloodthirsty
and
brutal
that
one
can
not
now
read
of
them
without
a
shudder
of
repulsion
nevertheless
from
the
very
first
dawn
of
his
intelligence
man
appears
always
to
have
felt
the
necessity
of
believing
in
something
stronger
and
more
lasting
than
himself
and
his
first
gropings
for
truth
led
him
to
evolve
desperate
notions
of
something
more
cruel
more
relentless
and
more
wicked
than
himself
rather
than
ideals
of
something
more
beautiful
more
just
more
faithful
and
more
loving
than
he
could
be
the
dawn
of
christianity
brought
the
first
glimmering
suggestion
that
a
gospel
of
love
and
pity
might
be
more
serviceable
in
the
end
to
the
needs
of
the
world
than
a
ruthless
code
of
slaughter
and
vengeance
though
history
shows
us
that
the
annals
of
christianity
itself
are
stained
with
crime
and
shamed
by
the
shedding
of
innocent
blood
only
in
these
latter
days
has
the
world
become
faintly
conscious
of
the
real
force
working
behind
and
through
all
things
the
soul
of
the
divine
or
the
psychic
element
animating
and
inspiring
all
visible
and
invisible
nature
this
soul
of
the
divine
this
psychic
element
however
is
almost
entirely
absent
from
the
teaching
of
the
christian
creed
with
the
result
that
the
creed
itself
is
losing
its
power
i
venture
to
say
that
a
very
small
majority
of
the
millions
of
persons
worshipping
in
the
various
forms
of
the
christian
church
really
and
truly
believe
what
they
publicly
profess
clergy
and
laity
alike
are
tainted
with
this
worst
of
all
hypocrisies
that
of
calling
god
to
witness
their
faith
when
they
know
they
are
faithless
it
may
be
asked
how
i
dare
to
make
such
an
assertion
i
dare
because
i
know
it
would
be
impossible
to
the
people
of
this
or
any
other
country
to
honestly
believe
the
christian
creed
and
yet
continue
to
live
as
they
do
their
lives
give
the
lie
to
their
avowed
religion
and
it
is
this
daily
spectacle
of
the
daily
life
of
governments
trades
professions
and
society
which
causes
me
to
feel
that
the
general
aspect
of
christendom
at
the
present
day
with
all
its
churches
and
solemn
observances
is
one
of
the
most
painful
and
profound
hypocrisy
you
who
read
this
page
possibly
with
indignation
you
call
yourself
a
christian
no
doubt
but
are
you
do
you
truly
think
that
when
death
shall
come
to
you
it
is
really
not
death
but
the
simple
transition
into
another
and
better
life
do
you
believe
in
the
actual
immortality
of
your
soul
and
do
you
realise
what
it
means
you
do
you
are
quite
sure
then
do
you
live
as
one
convinced
of
it
are
you
quite
indifferent
to
the
riches
and
purely
material
advantages
of
this
world
are
you
as
happy
in
poverty
as
in
wealth
and
are
you
independent
of
social
esteem
are
you
bent
on
the
very
highest
and
most
unselfish
ideals
of
life
and
conduct
i
do
not
say
you
are
not
i
merely
ask
if
you
are
if
your
answer
is
in
the
affirmative
do
not
give
the
lie
to
your
creed
by
your
daily
habits
conversation
and
manners
for
this
is
what
thousands
of
professing
christians
do
and
the
clergy
are
by
no
means
exempt
i
know
very
well
of
course
that
i
must
not
expect
your
appreciation
or
even
your
attention
in
matters
purely
spiritual
the
world
is
too
much
with
you
and
you
become
obstinate
of
opinion
and
rooted
in
prejudice
nevertheless
as
i
said
before
this
is
not
my
concern
your
moods
are
not
mine
and
with
your
prejudices
i
have
nothing
to
do
my
creed
is
drawn
from
nature
nature
just
invincible
yet
tender
nature
who
shows
us
that
life
as
we
know
it
now
at
this
very
time
and
in
this
very
world
is
a
blessing
so
rich
in
its
as
yet
unused
powers
and
possibilities
that
it
may
be
truly
said
of
the
greater
majority
of
human
beings
that
scarce
one
of
them
has
ever
begun
to
learn
how
to
live
shakespeare
the
greatest
human
exponent
of
human
nature
at
its
best
and
worst
the
profound
thinker
and
artist
who
dealt
boldly
with
the
facts
of
good
and
evil
as
they
truly
are
and
did
not
hesitate
to
contrast
them
forcibly
without
any
of
the
deceptive
of
vice
and
virtue
which
are
the
chief
of
such
modern
authors
as
we
may
call
makes
his
hamlet
exclaim
what
a
piece
of
work
is
man
how
noble
in
reason
how
infinite
in
faculty
in
form
and
moving
how
express
and
admirable
in
action
how
like
an
angel
in
apprehension
how
like
a
god
let
us
consider
two
of
these
designations
in
particular
infinite
in
faculty
and
apprehension
how
like
a
god
the
sentences
are
prophetic
like
so
many
of
shakespeare
utterances
they
foretell
the
true
condition
of
the
soul
of
man
when
it
shall
have
discovered
its
capabilities
in
faculty
that
is
to
say
able
to
do
all
it
shall
will
to
do
there
is
no
end
to
this
power
no
hindrance
in
either
earth
or
heaven
to
its
resolute
working
no
stint
to
the
on
which
it
may
draw
unceasingly
and
apprehension
how
like
a
god
here
the
word
is
used
in
the
sense
of
attaining
knowledge
to
learn
or
to
wisdom
it
means
of
course
that
if
the
soul
capability
of
or
learning
the
true
meaning
and
use
of
every
fact
and
circumstance
which
environs
its
existence
were
properly
perceived
and
applied
then
the
of
in
which
the
creator
made
humanity
would
become
the
veritable
likeness
of
the
divine
but
as
this
powerful
and
infinite
faculty
of
apprehension
is
seldom
if
ever
rightly
understood
and
as
man
generally
concentrates
his
whole
effort
upon
ministering
to
his
purely
material
needs
utterly
ignoring
and
wilfully
refusing
to
realise
those
larger
claims
which
are
purely
spiritual
he
presents
the
appearance
of
a
maimed
and
imperfect
object
a
creature
who
having
strong
limbs
declines
to
use
the
same
or
who
possessing
incalculable
wealth
crazily
considers
himself
a
pauper
jesus
christ
whom
we
may
look
upon
as
a
human
incarnation
of
divine
thought
an
outcome
and
expression
of
the
or
law
of
god
came
to
teach
us
our
true
position
in
the
scale
of
the
great
creative
and
progressive
purpose
but
in
the
days
of
his
coming
men
would
not
listen
nor
will
they
listen
even
now
they
say
with
their
mouths
but
they
do
not
believe
with
their
hearts
that
he
rose
from
the
dead
and
they
can
not
understand
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
never
died
seeing
that
death
for
him
as
for
all
who
have
mastered
the
inward
constitution
and
commingling
of
the
elements
was
impossible
his
real
life
was
not
injured
or
affected
by
the
agony
on
the
cross
or
by
his
three
days
entombment
the
one
was
a
torture
to
his
physical
frame
which
to
the
limited
perception
of
those
who
watched
him
as
they
thought
appeared
like
a
dissolution
of
the
whole
man
the
other
was
the
mere
rest
and
silence
necessary
for
what
is
called
the
of
the
resurrection
but
which
was
simply
the
natural
rising
of
the
same
body
the
atoms
of
which
were
and
made
immortal
by
the
imperishable
spirit
which
owned
and
held
them
in
being
the
whole
life
and
of
christ
was
and
is
a
great
symbolic
lesson
to
mankind
of
the
infinite
power
of
that
within
us
which
we
call
soul
but
which
we
may
perhaps
in
these
scientific
days
term
an
eternal
capable
of
exhaustless
energy
and
of
readjustment
to
varying
conditions
life
is
all
life
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
in
its
composition
and
the
intelligent
comprehension
of
its
endless
ways
and
methods
of
change
and
expression
is
the
secret
of
the
universe
it
appears
to
be
generally
accepted
that
we
are
not
to
know
this
secret
that
it
is
too
vast
and
deep
for
our
limited
capacities
and
that
even
if
we
did
know
it
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
us
as
we
are
bound
hard
and
fast
by
certain
natural
and
elemental
laws
over
which
we
have
no
control
old
truisms
are
and
violently
asserted
namely
that
our
business
is
merely
to
be
born
to
live
breed
and
arrange
things
as
well
as
we
can
for
those
who
come
after
us
and
then
to
die
and
there
an
end
a
stupid
round
of
existence
not
one
whit
higher
than
that
of
the
silkworm
is
it
for
such
a
monotonous
commonplace
way
of
life
and
purpose
as
this
that
humanity
has
been
endowed
with
faculty
is
it
for
such
poor
aims
and
ends
as
these
that
we
are
told
in
the
legended
account
of
the
beginning
of
things
to
the
earth
and
subdue
it
there
is
great
meaning
in
that
command
it
the
business
of
each
one
of
us
who
has
come
into
the
knowledge
and
possession
of
his
or
her
own
soul
is
to
the
earth
that
is
to
hold
it
and
all
it
contains
under
subjection
not
to
allow
its
forces
whether
interior
or
exterior
to
subdue
the
soul
but
it
may
perhaps
be
said
we
do
not
yet
understand
all
the
forces
with
which
we
have
to
contend
and
in
this
way
they
master
us
that
may
be
so
but
if
it
is
so
with
any
of
you
it
is
quite
your
own
fault
your
own
fault
i
say
for
there
is
no
power
human
or
divine
that
compels
you
to
remain
in
ignorance
each
one
of
you
has
a
master
talisman
and
key
to
all
locked
doors
no
state
education
can
do
for
you
what
you
might
do
for
yourselves
if
you
only
had
the
will
it
is
your
own
choice
entirely
if
you
elect
to
live
in
subjection
to
the
earth
instead
of
placing
the
earth
under
subjection
to
your
dominance
then
again
you
have
been
told
to
the
earth
as
well
as
to
subdue
it
in
these
latter
days
through
a
cupidity
as
amazing
as
criminal
you
are
not
so
much
as
impoverishing
the
earth
and
think
you
that
no
interest
will
be
exacted
for
your
reckless
plunder
you
mistake
you
complain
of
the
high
taxes
imposed
upon
you
by
your
merely
material
and
ephemeral
governments
but
you
forget
that
the
everlasting
government
of
all
worlds
demands
an
even
higher
rate
of
compensation
for
such
wrong
or
injurious
uses
as
you
make
of
this
world
which
was
and
is
intended
to
serve
as
a
place
of
training
for
the
development
and
perfection
of
the
whole
human
race
but
which
owing
to
personal
greed
and
selfishness
is
too
often
turned
into
a
mere
grave
for
the
interment
of
faulty
civilisations
in
studying
the
psychic
side
of
life
it
should
be
well
and
distinctly
understood
that
there
is
an
ever
living
spirit
within
each
one
of
us
a
spirit
for
which
there
is
no
limited
capacity
and
no
unfavourable
surroundings
its
capacity
is
infinite
as
god
and
its
surroundings
are
always
made
by
itself
it
is
its
own
heaven
and
once
established
within
that
everlasting
centre
it
radiates
from
the
inward
to
the
outward
thus
making
its
own
environment
not
only
now
but
for
ever
it
is
its
own
life
and
in
the
active
work
of
perpetually
and
itself
knows
nothing
of
death
i
must
now
claim
the
indulgence
of
those
among
my
readers
who
possess
the
rare
gift
of
patience
for
anything
that
may
seem
too
personal
in
the
following
statement
which
i
feel
it
almost
necessary
to
make
on
the
subject
of
my
own
psychic
creed
i
am
so
often
asked
if
i
believe
this
or
that
if
i
am
orthodox
if
i
am
a
sceptic
materialist
or
agnostic
that
i
should
like
if
possible
to
make
things
clear
between
myself
and
these
enquirers
therefore
i
may
say
at
once
that
my
belief
in
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
is
absolute
but
that
i
did
not
attain
to
the
faith
i
hold
without
hard
training
and
bitter
suffering
this
need
not
be
dwelt
upon
being
past
i
began
to
write
when
i
was
too
young
to
know
anything
of
the
world
worldly
ways
and
when
i
was
too
enthusiastic
and
too
much
carried
away
by
the
splendour
and
beauty
of
the
spiritual
ideal
to
realise
the
inevitable
derision
and
scorn
which
are
bound
to
fall
upon
untried
explorers
into
the
mysteries
of
the
unseen
yet
it
was
solely
on
account
of
a
strange
psychical
experience
which
chanced
to
myself
when
i
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
what
is
called
that
i
found
myself
producing
my
first
book
a
romance
of
two
worlds
it
was
a
rash
experiment
but
it
was
the
direct
result
of
an
initiation
into
some
few
of
the
truths
behind
the
veil
of
the
seeming
real
i
did
not
then
know
why
i
was
selected
for
such
an
and
i
do
not
know
even
now
it
arose
quite
naturally
out
of
a
series
of
ordinary
events
which
might
happen
to
anyone
i
was
not
compelled
or
persuaded
into
it
for
being
alone
in
the
world
and
more
or
less
friendless
i
had
no
opportunity
to
seek
advice
or
assistance
from
any
person
as
to
the
course
of
life
or
learning
i
should
pursue
and
i
learned
what
i
did
learn
because
of
my
own
unwavering
intention
and
will
to
be
instructed
i
should
here
perhaps
explain
the
tenor
of
the
instruction
which
was
gradually
imparted
to
me
in
just
such
measures
of
proportion
as
i
was
found
to
be
receptive
the
first
thing
i
was
taught
was
how
to
bring
every
feeling
and
sense
into
close
union
with
the
spirit
of
nature
nature
i
was
told
is
the
reflection
of
the
of
the
creator
and
any
opposition
to
that
on
the
part
of
any
living
organism
it
has
created
can
not
but
result
in
disaster
pursuing
this
line
of
study
a
wonderful
vista
of
perpetual
revealment
was
opened
to
me
i
saw
how
humanity
moved
by
gross
egoism
has
in
every
age
of
the
world
ordained
laws
and
morals
for
itself
which
are
the
very
reverse
of
nature
teaching
i
saw
how
instead
of
helping
the
wheel
of
progress
and
wisdom
onward
man
reverses
it
by
his
obstinacy
and
turns
it
backward
even
on
the
very
point
of
great
attainment
and
i
was
able
to
perceive
how
the
sorrows
and
despairs
of
the
world
are
caused
by
this
one
simple
fact
man
working
against
nature
while
nature
ever
divine
and
invincible
pursues
her
course
sweeping
her
puny
opponents
aside
and
inflexibly
carrying
out
her
will
to
the
end
and
i
learned
how
true
it
is
that
if
man
went
with
her
instead
of
against
her
there
would
be
no
more
misunderstanding
of
the
laws
of
the
universe
and
that
where
there
is
now
nothing
but
discord
all
would
be
divinest
harmony
my
first
book
a
romance
of
two
worlds
was
an
eager
though
crude
attempt
to
explain
and
express
something
of
what
i
myself
had
studied
on
some
of
these
subjects
though
as
i
have
already
said
my
mind
was
unformed
and
immature
and
therefore
i
was
not
permitted
to
disclose
more
than
a
glimmering
of
the
light
i
was
beginning
to
perceive
my
own
probation
destined
to
be
a
severe
one
had
only
just
been
entered
upon
and
hard
and
fast
limits
were
imposed
on
me
for
a
certain
time
i
was
forbidden
for
example
to
write
of
radium
that
wonderful
of
the
immediate
hour
though
it
was
then
and
had
been
for
a
long
period
perfectly
well
known
to
my
instructors
who
possessed
all
the
means
of
extracting
it
from
substances
as
yet
undreamed
of
by
scientists
i
was
only
permitted
to
hint
at
it
under
the
guise
of
the
word
which
after
all
was
not
so
much
of
a
misnomer
seeing
that
electric
force
displays
itself
in
countless
millions
of
forms
my
electric
theory
of
the
universe
in
the
romance
of
two
worlds
foreran
the
utterance
of
the
scientist
who
in
the
hibbert
journal
for
january
wrote
as
follows
the
last
years
have
seen
the
dawn
of
a
revolution
in
science
as
great
as
that
which
in
the
sphere
of
religion
overthrew
the
many
gods
and
crowned
the
one
matter
as
we
have
understood
it
there
is
none
nor
probably
anywhere
the
individual
atom
the
atoms
are
systems
of
electronic
corpuscles
bound
together
by
their
mutual
forces
too
firmly
for
any
human
contrivance
completely
to
sunder
them
alike
in
their
electric
composition
differing
only
in
the
rhythms
of
their
motion
electricity
is
all
things
and
all
things
are
electric
this
was
precisely
my
teaching
in
the
first
book
i
ever
wrote
i
was
ridiculed
for
it
of
course
and
i
was
told
that
there
was
no
force
in
electricity
i
differ
from
this
view
but
is
perhaps
the
better
because
the
truer
term
to
employ
in
seeking
to
describe
the
germ
or
embryo
of
the
soul
for
as
scientists
have
proved
radium
is
capable
of
absorbing
from
surrounding
bodies
some
unknown
form
of
energy
which
it
can
render
evident
as
heat
and
light
this
is
precisely
what
the
in
each
individual
soul
of
each
individual
human
being
is
ordained
to
do
to
absorb
an
form
of
energy
which
it
can
render
evident
as
heat
and
light
heat
and
light
are
the
composition
of
life
and
the
life
which
this
of
soul
generates
in
itself
and
of
itself
can
never
die
or
as
i
wrote
in
a
romance
of
two
worlds
like
all
flames
this
electric
or
radiant
spark
can
either
be
fanned
into
a
fire
or
allowed
to
escape
in
air
it
can
never
be
destroyed
and
again
from
the
same
book
all
the
wonders
of
nature
are
the
result
of
light
and
heat
alone
paracelsus
as
early
as
about
made
guarded
mention
of
the
same
substance
or
quality
describing
it
thus
the
more
of
the
humour
of
life
it
has
the
more
of
the
spirit
of
life
abounds
in
that
life
though
truly
this
vital
force
lacks
all
fitting
name
to
material
science
radium
or
radium
chloride
is
a
minute
salt
crystal
so
rare
and
costly
to
obtain
that
it
may
be
counted
as
about
three
thousand
times
the
price
of
gold
in
the
market
but
of
the
action
of
pure
radium
the
knowledge
of
ordinary
scientific
students
is
nil
they
know
that
an
infinitely
small
spark
of
radium
salt
will
emit
heat
and
light
continuously
without
any
combustion
or
change
in
its
own
structure
and
i
would
here
quote
a
passage
from
a
lecture
delivered
by
one
of
our
prominent
scientists
in
details
concerning
the
behaviour
of
several
bodies
were
detected
as
for
example
their
activity
was
not
constant
it
gradually
grew
in
strength
but
the
grown
portion
of
the
activity
could
be
blown
away
and
the
blown
away
part
retained
its
activity
only
for
a
time
it
decayed
in
a
few
days
or
weeks
whereas
the
radium
rose
in
strength
again
at
the
same
rate
that
the
other
decayed
and
so
on
constantly
it
was
as
if
a
new
form
of
matter
was
constantly
being
produced
and
as
if
the
was
a
concomitant
of
the
change
of
form
it
was
also
found
that
radium
kept
on
producing
heat
de
novo
so
as
to
keep
itself
always
a
fraction
of
a
degree
above
the
surrounding
temperature
also
that
it
spontaneously
produced
electricity
does
this
teach
no
lesson
on
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
of
the
away
part
which
decays
in
a
few
days
or
weeks
of
the
or
of
the
soul
rising
in
strength
again
at
the
same
rate
that
the
other
the
body
or
portion
of
the
activity
decays
of
the
form
of
matter
and
the
as
a
concomitant
of
the
change
of
form
does
not
science
here
almost
unwittingly
verify
the
words
of
paul
it
is
sown
a
natural
body
it
is
raised
a
spiritual
body
there
is
a
natural
body
and
there
is
a
spiritual
body
there
is
nothing
impossible
or
in
such
a
consummation
even
according
to
modern
material
science
it
is
merely
the
natural
action
of
pure
or
that
etherical
composition
for
which
we
have
no
name
but
which
we
have
vaguely
called
the
soul
for
countless
ages
to
multitudes
of
people
this
expression
soul
has
become
overfamiliar
by
constant
repetition
and
conveys
little
more
than
the
suggestion
of
a
myth
or
the
hint
of
an
imaginary
existence
now
there
is
nothing
in
the
whole
universe
so
real
as
the
vital
germ
of
the
actual
form
and
being
of
the
living
radiant
active
creature
within
each
one
of
us
the
creature
who
impressed
and
guided
by
our
free
will
works
out
its
own
delight
or
doom
the
will
of
each
man
or
woman
is
like
the
compass
of
a
ship
where
it
points
the
ship
goes
if
the
needle
directs
it
to
the
rocks
there
is
wreck
and
disaster
if
to
the
open
sea
there
is
clear
sailing
god
leaves
the
will
of
man
at
perfect
liberty
his
divine
love
neither
constrains
nor
compels
we
must
ourselves
learn
the
ways
of
right
and
wrong
and
having
learned
we
must
choose
we
must
injure
ourselves
god
will
not
injure
us
we
invite
our
own
miseries
god
does
not
send
them
the
evils
and
sorrows
that
afflict
mankind
are
of
mankind
own
making
even
in
natural
catastrophes
which
ruin
cities
and
devastate
countries
it
is
well
to
remember
that
nature
which
is
the
material
expression
of
the
mind
of
god
will
not
tolerate
too
long
a
burden
of
human
iniquity
nature
destroys
what
is
putrescent
she
covers
it
up
with
fresh
earth
on
which
healthier
things
may
find
place
to
grow
i
tried
to
convey
some
hint
of
these
truths
in
my
romance
of
two
worlds
some
few
gave
heed
others
wrote
to
me
from
all
parts
of
the
world
concerning
what
they
called
my
on
the
subjects
treated
of
some
asked
to
be
into
my
of
the
unseen
but
many
of
my
correspondents
i
say
it
with
regret
were
moved
by
purely
selfish
considerations
for
their
own
private
and
particular
advancement
and
showed
by
the
very
tone
of
their
letters
not
only
an
astounding
hypocrisy
but
also
the
good
opinion
they
entertained
of
their
own
worthiness
their
own
capabilities
and
their
own
great
intellectuality
forgetful
of
the
words
except
ye
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
not
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
now
the
spirit
of
a
little
child
is
receptive
and
trustful
it
has
no
desire
for
argument
and
it
is
instinctively
confident
that
it
will
not
be
led
into
unnecessary
difficulty
or
danger
by
its
responsible
guardians
this
is
the
spirit
in
which
if
we
are
sincere
in
our
seeking
for
knowledge
we
should
and
must
approach
the
deeper
psychological
mysteries
of
nature
but
as
long
as
we
interpose
the
darkness
of
personal
doubt
and
prejudice
between
ourselves
and
the
light
eternal
no
progress
can
be
made
and
every
attempt
to
penetrate
into
the
holy
of
holies
will
be
met
and
thrust
back
by
that
sword
which
from
the
beginning
as
now
turns
every
way
to
guard
the
tree
of
life
knowing
this
and
seeing
that
self
was
the
with
most
of
my
correspondents
i
was
anxious
to
write
another
book
at
once
also
in
the
guise
of
a
romance
to
serve
as
a
little
lamp
of
love
whereby
my
readers
might
haply
discover
the
real
character
of
the
obstacle
which
blocked
their
way
to
an
intelligent
but
the
publisher
i
had
at
the
time
the
late
george
bentley
assured
me
that
if
i
wrote
another
book
i
should
lose
the
public
hearing
i
had
just
gained
i
do
not
know
why
he
had
formed
this
opinion
but
as
he
was
a
kindly
personal
friend
and
took
a
keen
interest
in
my
career
never
handing
any
manuscript
of
mine
over
to
his
but
always
reading
it
himself
i
felt
it
incumbent
upon
me
as
a
young
beginner
to
accept
the
advice
which
i
knew
could
only
be
given
with
the
very
best
intentions
towards
me
to
please
him
therefore
and
to
please
the
particular
public
to
which
he
had
introduced
me
i
wrote
something
entirely
different
a
melodramatic
tale
entitled
vendetta
the
story
of
one
forgotten
the
book
made
a
certain
stir
and
bentley
next
begged
me
to
try
pur
et
simple
i
quote
from
his
own
letter
the
result
was
my
novel
of
thelma
which
achieved
a
great
popular
success
and
still
remains
a
favourite
work
with
a
large
majority
of
readers
i
then
considered
myself
free
to
move
once
more
upon
the
lines
which
my
study
of
psychic
forces
had
convinced
me
were
of
importance
and
moved
by
a
strong
conviction
that
men
and
women
are
hindered
from
attaining
their
full
heritage
of
life
by
the
obstinate
interposition
of
their
merely
material
selves
i
wrote
ardath
the
story
of
a
dead
self
the
plan
of
this
book
was
partially
suggested
by
the
following
passages
from
the
second
apocryphal
book
of
esdras
go
into
a
field
of
flowers
where
no
house
is
builded
and
pray
unto
the
highest
continually
then
will
i
come
and
talk
with
thee
so
i
went
my
way
into
the
field
which
is
called
ardath
like
as
he
commanded
me
and
there
i
sat
among
the
flowers
in
this
field
the
prophet
sees
the
vision
of
a
woman
and
it
came
to
pass
while
i
was
talking
with
her
behold
her
face
upon
a
sudden
shined
exceedingly
and
her
countenance
glistened
so
that
i
was
afraid
of
her
and
mused
what
it
might
be
and
i
looked
and
behold
the
woman
appeared
unto
me
no
more
but
there
was
a
city
builded
and
a
large
place
showed
itself
from
the
foundations
on
this
i
raised
the
fabric
of
my
own
dream
city
and
sought
to
elucidate
some
of
the
meaning
of
that
great
text
in
ecclesiastes
which
contains
in
itself
all
the
philosophy
of
the
ages
that
which
hath
been
is
now
and
that
which
is
to
be
hath
already
been
and
god
requireth
that
which
is
past
the
book
however
so
my
publisher
bentley
told
me
in
a
series
of
letters
which
i
still
possess
and
which
show
how
keen
was
his
own
interest
in
my
work
was
over
the
heads
of
the
general
public
his
opinion
was
no
doubt
correct
as
ardath
still
remains
the
least
of
any
book
i
have
ever
written
nevertheless
it
brought
me
the
unsought
and
very
generous
praise
of
the
late
poet
laureate
alfred
lord
tennyson
as
well
as
the
equally
unsought
good
opinion
and
personal
friendship
of
the
famous
statesman
william
ewart
gladstone
while
many
of
the
literary
journals
vied
with
one
another
in
according
me
an
almost
enthusiastic
eulogy
such
authorities
as
the
athenaeum
and
spectator
praised
the
whole
conception
and
style
of
the
work
the
latter
journal
going
as
far
as
to
say
that
i
had
beaten
beckford
famous
vathek
on
its
own
ground
whatever
may
now
be
the
consensus
of
opinion
on
its
merits
or
demerits
i
know
and
feel
it
to
be
one
of
my
most
worthy
attempts
even
though
it
is
not
favoured
by
the
million
it
does
not
appeal
to
anything
the
moment
merely
because
there
are
very
few
people
who
can
or
will
understand
that
if
the
soul
or
of
a
human
being
is
so
forgetful
of
its
highest
origin
as
to
cling
to
its
human
self
only
events
the
hero
of
ardath
clung
to
the
shadow
of
his
former
self
and
to
the
illusory
pictures
of
that
former
self
pleasures
and
vices
and
vanities
then
the
way
to
the
eternal
happier
progress
is
barred
there
is
yet
another
intention
in
this
book
which
seems
to
be
missed
by
the
casual
reader
namely
that
each
human
soul
is
a
germ
of
separate
and
individual
spiritual
existence
even
as
no
two
leaves
are
exactly
alike
on
any
tree
and
no
two
blades
of
grass
are
precisely
similar
so
no
two
souls
resemble
each
other
but
are
wholly
different
endowed
with
different
gifts
and
different
capacities
individuality
is
strongly
insisted
upon
in
material
nature
and
why
because
material
nature
is
merely
the
reflex
or
mirror
of
the
more
strongly
insistent
individuality
of
psychic
form
again
psychic
form
is
generated
from
a
divinely
eternal
psychic
substance
a
or
emanation
of
own
being
which
as
it
progresses
onward
through
endless
aeons
of
constantly
renewed
vitality
grows
more
and
more
powerful
changing
its
shape
often
but
never
its
everlasting
composition
and
quality
therefore
all
the
experiences
of
the
or
psychic
form
from
its
first
entrance
into
active
consciousness
whether
in
this
world
or
in
other
worlds
are
attracted
to
itself
by
its
own
inherent
volition
and
work
together
to
make
it
what
it
is
now
and
what
it
will
be
hereafter
that
is
what
ardath
the
story
of
a
dead
self
seeks
to
explain
and
i
have
nothing
to
take
back
from
what
i
have
written
in
its
pages
in
its
experimental
teaching
it
is
the
natural
and
intended
sequence
of
a
romance
of
two
worlds
and
was
meant
to
assist
the
studies
of
the
many
who
had
written
to
me
asking
for
help
and
despite
the
fact
that
some
of
these
persons
owing
to
an
inherent
incapacity
for
concentrated
thought
upon
any
subject
found
it
too
as
they
said
for
casual
reading
its
reception
was
sufficiently
encouraging
to
decide
me
on
continuing
to
press
upon
public
attention
the
theories
therein
set
forth
the
soul
of
lilith
was
therefore
my
next
venture
a
third
link
in
the
chain
i
sought
to
weave
between
the
perishable
materialism
of
our
ordinary
conceptions
of
life
and
the
undying
spiritual
quality
of
life
as
it
truly
is
in
this
i
portrayed
the
complete
failure
that
must
inevitably
result
from
man
prejudice
and
intellectual
pride
when
studying
the
marvellous
mysteries
of
what
i
would
call
the
further
world
that
is
to
say
the
of
the
world
which
is
hidden
deeply
behind
its
external
appearance
and
how
impossible
it
is
and
ever
must
be
that
any
should
visibly
manifest
itself
where
there
is
undue
attachment
to
the
body
the
publication
of
the
book
was
a
very
interesting
experience
it
was
and
is
still
less
than
ardath
but
it
has
been
gladly
welcomed
by
a
distinctly
cultured
minority
of
persons
famous
in
art
science
and
literature
whose
good
opinion
is
well
worth
having
with
this
reward
i
was
perfectly
content
but
my
publisher
was
not
so
easily
pleased
he
wanted
something
that
would
better
to
relieve
his
impatience
therefore
i
wrote
a
more
or
less
novel
dealing
with
the
absinthe
drinkers
of
paris
entitled
wormwood
which
did
a
certain
amount
of
good
in
its
way
by
helping
to
call
public
attention
to
the
devastation
wrought
by
the
use
of
the
pernicious
drug
among
the
french
and
other
continental
peoples
and
after
this
receiving
a
strong
and
almost
imperative
impetus
towards
that
particular
goal
whither
my
mind
was
set
i
went
to
work
again
with
renewed
vigour
on
my
own
favourite
and
long
studied
line
of
argument
indifferent
alike
to
publisher
or
public
filled
with
the
fervour
of
a
passionate
and
proved
faith
i
wrote
barabbas
a
dream
of
the
world
tragedy
and
this
was
the
signal
of
separation
from
my
excellent
old
friend
george
bentley
who
had
not
the
courage
to
publish
a
poetic
romance
which
introduced
albeit
with
a
tenderness
and
reverence
unspeakable
so
far
as
my
own
intention
was
concerned
the
crucifixion
and
resurrection
of
christ
he
wrote
to
me
expressing
his
opinion
in
these
terms
i
can
conscientiously
praise
the
power
and
feeling
you
exhibit
for
your
vast
subject
and
the
rush
and
beauty
of
the
language
and
above
all
i
feel
that
the
book
is
the
genuine
outcome
of
a
fervent
faith
all
too
rare
in
these
days
but
i
fear
its
effect
on
the
public
mind
yet
when
urged
to
a
given
point
in
the
discussion
he
could
not
deny
that
effect
on
the
public
mind
of
the
passion
play
at
is
generally
impressive
and
helpful
while
he
was
bound
to
admit
that
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
the
introduction
of
divine
personages
in
the
epic
romances
of
milton
and
dante
what
could
be
written
in
poetic
verse
did
not
however
seem
to
him
suitable
for
poetic
prose
and
i
did
not
waste
words
in
argument
as
i
knew
the
time
had
come
for
the
parting
of
the
ways
i
sought
my
present
publisher
methuen
who
being
aware
from
a
business
point
of
view
that
i
had
now
won
a
certain
reputation
took
barabbas
without
parley
it
met
with
an
almost
unprecedented
success
not
only
in
this
country
but
all
over
the
world
within
a
few
months
it
was
translated
into
every
known
european
language
inclusive
even
of
modern
greek
and
nowhere
perhaps
has
it
awakened
a
wider
interest
than
in
india
where
it
is
published
in
hindustani
gujarati
and
various
other
eastern
dialects
its
notable
triumph
was
achieved
despite
a
hailstorm
of
abuse
rattled
down
upon
me
by
the
press
a
hailstorm
which
i
personally
found
welcome
and
refreshing
inasmuch
as
it
cleared
the
air
and
cleaned
the
road
for
my
better
wayfaring
it
released
me
once
and
for
all
from
the
trammels
of
such
obligation
as
is
incurred
by
praise
and
set
me
firmly
on
my
feet
in
that
complete
independence
which
to
me
and
to
all
who
seek
what
i
have
found
is
a
paramount
necessity
for
as
thomas
a
kempis
writes
whosoever
neither
desires
to
please
men
nor
fears
to
displease
them
shall
enjoy
much
peace
i
took
my
freedom
gratefully
and
ever
since
that
time
of
unjust
and
attack
from
persons
who
were
too
malignantly
minded
to
even
read
the
work
they
vainly
endeavoured
to
destroy
have
been
happily
indifferent
to
all
and
immune
from
all
attempts
to
interrupt
my
progress
or
turn
me
back
upon
my
chosen
way
from
henceforth
i
recognised
that
no
one
could
hinder
or
oppose
me
but
myself
and
that
i
had
the
making
tinder
god
of
my
own
destiny
i
followed
up
barabbas
as
quickly
as
possible
by
the
sorrows
of
satan
thus
carrying
out
the
preconceived
intention
i
had
always
had
of
depicting
first
the
martyrdom
which
is
always
the
world
guerdon
to
absolute
good
and
secondly
the
awful
unimaginable
torture
which
must
by
divine
law
for
ever
be
the
lot
of
absolute
evil
the
two
books
carried
their
message
far
and
wide
with
astonishing
success
and
swiftness
and
i
then
drew
some
of
my
threads
of
former
argument
together
in
the
master
christian
wherein
i
depicted
christ
as
a
child
visiting
our
world
again
as
it
is
and
sorrowfully
observing
the
wickedness
which
men
practise
in
his
name
this
book
was
seized
upon
by
thousands
of
readers
in
all
countries
of
the
world
with
an
amazing
avidity
which
proved
how
deep
was
the
longing
for
some
clear
exposition
of
faith
that
might
console
as
well
as
command
and
after
its
publication
i
decided
to
let
it
take
its
own
uninterrupted
course
for
a
time
and
to
change
my
own
line
of
work
to
lighter
themes
lest
i
should
be
set
down
as
or
both
of
which
terms
have
been
brought
into
contempt
by
tricksters
so
i
played
with
my
pen
and
did
my
best
to
entertain
the
public
with
stories
of
everyday
life
and
love
such
as
the
least
instructed
could
understand
and
that
i
now
allude
to
the
psychological
side
of
my
work
is
merely
to
explain
that
these
six
books
namely
a
romance
of
two
worlds
ardath
the
story
of
a
dead
self
the
soul
of
lilith
barabbas
the
sorrows
of
satan
and
the
master
christian
are
the
result
of
a
deliberately
conceived
plan
and
intention
and
are
all
linked
together
by
the
one
theory
they
have
not
been
written
solely
as
pieces
of
fiction
for
which
i
the
author
am
paid
by
the
publisher
or
you
the
reader
are
content
to
be
temporarily
entertained
they
are
the
outcome
of
what
i
myself
have
learned
practised
and
proved
in
the
daily
experiences
both
small
and
great
of
daily
life
you
may
probably
say
and
you
probably
will
say
what
does
that
matter
to
us
we
do
not
care
a
jot
for
your
they
are
transcendental
and
absurd
they
bore
us
to
extinction
nevertheless
quite
callous
as
you
are
or
may
be
there
must
come
a
time
when
pain
and
sorrow
have
you
in
their
grip
when
what
you
call
stands
face
to
face
with
you
and
when
you
will
find
that
all
you
have
thought
desired
or
planned
for
your
own
pleasure
and
all
that
you
possess
of
material
good
or
advantage
vanishes
like
smoke
leaving
nothing
behind
when
the
world
will
seem
no
more
than
a
small
receding
point
from
which
you
must
fall
into
the
unknown
and
when
that
dread
of
something
after
death
the
undiscovered
country
from
whose
bourn
no
traveller
returns
puzzles
the
will
you
have
at
present
living
among
you
a
great
professing
scientist
oliver
lodge
who
wandering
among
mazy
infinities
conceives
it
even
possible
to
communicate
with
departed
spirits
while
i
who
have
no
such
weight
of
worldly
authority
and
learning
behind
me
tell
you
that
such
a
thing
is
out
of
all
natural
law
and
therefore
can
never
be
nature
can
and
will
unveil
to
us
many
mysteries
that
seem
when
they
are
only
manifestations
of
the
deepest
centre
of
the
purest
natural
but
nothing
can
alter
divine
law
or
change
the
system
which
has
governed
the
universe
from
the
beginning
and
by
this
divine
law
and
system
we
have
to
learn
that
the
are
not
dead
they
have
merely
been
removed
to
fresh
life
and
new
spheres
of
action
under
which
circumstances
they
can
not
possibly
hold
communication
with
us
in
any
way
unless
they
again
assume
the
human
form
and
human
existence
in
this
case
which
very
frequently
happens
it
takes
not
only
time
for
us
to
know
them
but
it
also
demands
a
certain
instinctive
receptiveness
on
our
parts
or
willingness
to
recognise
them
even
the
risen
saviour
was
not
at
first
recognised
by
his
own
disciples
it
is
because
i
have
been
practically
convinced
of
this
truth
and
because
i
have
learned
that
life
is
not
and
never
can
be
death
but
only
constant
change
and
reinvestment
of
spirit
into
form
that
i
have
presumed
so
far
as
to
allude
to
my
own
faith
and
experience
a
touch
for
which
i
readily
apologise
knowing
that
it
can
not
be
interesting
to
the
majority
who
would
never
take
the
trouble
to
shape
their
lives
as
i
seek
to
shape
mine
still
if
there
are
one
or
two
out
of
a
million
who
feel
as
i
do
that
life
and
love
are
of
little
worth
if
they
must
end
in
dark
nothingness
these
may
perhaps
have
the
patience
to
come
with
me
through
the
pages
of
a
narrative
which
is
neither
nor
nor
anything
which
should
pertain
to
the
modern
or
and
which
has
been
written
because
the
writing
of
it
enforced
itself
upon
me
with
an
insistence
that
would
take
no
denial
perhaps
there
will
be
at
least
one
among
those
who
turn
over
this
book
who
will
be
sufficiently
interested
in
the
psychic
that
is
to
say
the
immortal
and
therefore
the
only
real
side
of
life
to
give
a
little
undivided
attention
to
the
subject
to
that
one
i
address
myself
and
say
will
you
to
begin
with
drop
your
burden
of
preconceived
opinions
and
prejudices
whatever
they
are
will
you
set
aside
the
small
cares
and
trifles
that
affect
your
own
material
personality
will
you
detach
yourself
from
your
own
private
and
particular
surroundings
for
a
space
and
agree
to
think
with
me
thinking
is
i
know
the
hardest
of
all
hard
tasks
to
the
modern
mind
but
if
you
would
learn
you
must
undertake
this
trouble
if
you
would
find
the
path
which
is
made
fair
and
brilliant
by
the
radiance
of
the
soul
imperishable
summer
you
must
not
grudge
time
if
i
try
no
matter
how
inadequately
to
show
you
something
of
the
mystic
power
that
makes
for
happiness
do
not
shut
your
eyes
in
scorn
or
languor
to
the
smallest
flash
of
light
through
your
darkness
which
may
help
you
to
a
mastery
of
the
secret
i
say
again
will
you
think
with
me
will
you
for
instance
think
of
life
what
is
it
of
death
what
is
it
what
is
the
primary
object
of
living
what
is
the
problem
solved
by
dying
all
these
questions
should
have
answer
for
nothing
is
without
a
meaning
and
nothing
ever
has
been
or
ever
will
be
without
a
purpose
in
this
world
apparently
and
according
to
our
surface
knowledge
of
all
physical
and
mental
phenomena
it
would
seem
that
the
chief
business
of
humanity
is
to
continually
itself
man
exists
in
his
own
opinion
merely
to
perpetuate
man
all
the
wonders
of
the
earth
air
fire
and
water
all
the
sustenance
drawn
from
the
teeming
bosom
of
nature
all
the
progress
of
countless
civilisations
in
ever
recurring
and
repeated
processional
order
all
the
sciences
old
and
new
are
solely
to
nourish
support
instruct
entertain
and
furnish
food
and
employment
for
the
tiny
imp
of
chance
spawned
as
he
himself
asserts
out
of
gas
and
atoms
yet
as
he
personally
declares
through
the
mouth
of
his
modern
science
he
is
not
of
real
importance
withal
the
little
planet
on
which
he
dwells
would
to
all
seeming
move
on
in
its
orbit
in
the
same
way
as
it
does
now
without
him
in
itself
it
is
a
pigmy
world
compared
with
the
rest
of
the
solar
system
of
which
it
is
a
part
nevertheless
the
fact
can
not
be
denied
that
his
material
surroundings
are
of
a
quality
tending
to
either
impress
or
to
deceive
man
with
a
sense
of
his
own
value
the
world
is
his
oyster
which
he
with
the
sword
of
enterprise
will
open
and
all
his
natural
instincts
urge
him
to
perpetuate
himself
in
some
form
or
other
incessantly
and
without
stint
why
why
is
his
existence
judged
to
be
necessary
why
should
he
not
cease
to
be
trees
would
grow
flowers
would
bloom
birds
would
sing
fish
would
glide
through
the
rivers
and
the
seas
the
insect
and
animal
tribes
of
field
and
forest
would
enjoy
their
existence
unmolested
and
the
great
sun
would
shine
on
ever
the
same
rising
at
dawn
sinking
at
even
with
unbroken
exactitude
and
regularity
if
man
no
longer
lived
why
have
the
monstrous
forces
of
evolution
thundered
their
way
through
cycles
of
creation
to
produce
so
infinitesimal
a
prodigy
till
this
question
is
answered
so
long
must
life
seem
at
its
best
but
vague
and
unsatisfactory
so
long
over
all
things
must
brood
the
shadow
of
death
made
more
gloomy
by
hopeless
contemplation
so
long
must
creation
appear
something
of
a
cruel
farce
for
which
peoples
and
civilisations
come
into
being
merely
to
be
destroyed
and
leave
no
trace
all
the
work
futile
all
the
education
useless
all
the
hope
vain
only
when
men
and
women
learn
that
their
lives
are
not
infinitesimal
but
infinite
that
each
of
them
possesses
within
himself
or
herself
an
eternal
active
conscious
individual
force
a
being
a
form
which
in
its
energy
draws
to
itself
and
accommodates
to
its
use
everything
that
is
necessary
for
the
accomplishment
of
its
endeavours
whether
such
endeavours
be
to
continue
its
life
on
this
planet
or
to
remove
to
other
spheres
only
then
will
it
be
clearly
understood
that
all
nature
is
the
subject
and
servant
of
this
radiant
energy
that
itself
is
the
or
emanation
of
god
and
that
as
such
it
has
its
eternal
part
to
perform
in
the
eternal
movement
towards
the
eternal
highest
i
now
leave
the
following
pages
to
the
reader
attentive
or
indifferent
consideration
to
me
as
i
have
already
stated
outside
opinion
is
of
no
moment
personally
speaking
i
should
perhaps
have
preferred
had
it
been
possible
to
set
forth
the
incidents
narrated
in
the
ensuing
in
the
form
of
separate
essays
on
the
nature
of
the
mystic
tuition
and
experience
through
which
some
of
us
in
this
workaday
world
have
the
courage
to
pass
successfully
but
i
know
that
the
masses
of
the
people
who
drift
restlessly
to
and
fro
upon
the
surface
of
this
planet
ever
seeking
for
comfort
in
various
forms
of
religion
and
too
often
finding
none
will
not
listen
to
any
spiritual
truth
unless
it
is
conveyed
to
them
as
though
they
were
children
in
the
form
of
a
i
am
not
the
heroine
of
the
tale
though
i
have
narrated
it
more
or
less
as
told
to
me
in
the
first
person
singular
because
it
seemed
to
me
simpler
and
more
direct
she
to
whom
the
perfect
comprehension
of
happiness
has
come
with
an
equally
perfect
possession
of
love
is
one
out
of
a
few
who
are
seeking
what
she
has
found
many
among
the
world
greatest
mystics
and
philosophers
have
tried
for
the
prizes
she
has
won
for
the
world
possesses
plato
the
bible
and
christ
but
in
its
apparent
present
ways
of
living
has
learned
little
or
nothing
from
the
three
so
that
other
teachers
may
well
despair
of
carrying
persuasion
where
such
mighty
predecessors
have
seemingly
failed
the
serious
and
real
things
of
life
are
nowadays
made
subjects
for
derision
rather
than
reverence
then
again
there
is
unhappily
an
alarmingly
increasing
majority
of
and
degenerate
persons
born
of
drunken
diseased
or
vicious
parents
who
are
mentally
unfit
for
the
loftier
forms
of
study
and
in
whom
the
mere
act
of
would
be
dangerous
and
likely
to
upset
their
mental
balance
altogether
while
by
far
the
larger
half
of
the
social
community
seek
to
avoid
the
consideration
of
anything
that
is
not
exactly
suited
to
their
tastes
some
of
our
most
respected
social
institutions
are
nothing
but
so
many
and
unconscious
oppositions
to
the
law
of
nature
which
is
the
law
of
god
and
thus
it
often
happens
that
when
obstinate
humanity
persists
in
considering
its
own
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
superior
to
the
eternal
decrees
which
have
been
visibly
presented
through
nature
since
the
earliest
dawn
of
creation
a
faulty
civilisation
sets
in
and
is
presently
swept
back
upon
its
advancing
wheels
and
forced
to
begin
again
with
primal
letters
of
learning
in
the
same
way
a
faulty
soul
an
imperfect
individual
spirit
is
likewise
compelled
to
return
to
school
and
resume
the
study
of
the
lessons
it
has
failed
to
put
into
practice
nevertheless
people
can
not
bear
to
have
it
plainly
said
or
written
down
as
it
has
been
said
and
written
down
over
and
over
again
any
time
since
the
world
began
that
all
the
corrupt
government
wars
slaveries
plagues
diseases
and
despairs
that
afflict
humanity
are
humanity
own
sins
taking
vengeance
upon
the
sinners
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
and
this
not
out
of
divine
cruelty
but
because
of
divine
law
which
from
the
first
ordained
that
evil
shall
slay
itself
leaving
room
only
for
good
men
and
women
alike
will
scarce
endure
to
read
any
book
which
urges
this
unalterable
fact
upon
their
attention
they
pronounce
the
author
or
to
lay
down
the
law
and
they
profess
to
be
scandalised
by
an
encounter
with
honesty
nevertheless
the
faithful
writer
of
things
as
they
are
will
not
be
disturbed
by
the
aspect
of
things
as
they
seem
spirit
the
creative
essence
of
all
that
is
works
in
various
forms
but
always
on
an
ascending
plane
and
it
invariably
rejects
and
destroys
whatever
interrupts
that
onward
and
upward
progress
being
in
itself
the
radiant
outflow
of
the
mind
of
god
it
is
the
life
of
the
universe
and
it
is
very
needful
to
understand
and
to
remember
that
there
is
nothing
which
can
properly
be
called
or
above
nature
inasmuch
as
this
eternal
spirit
of
energy
is
in
and
throughout
all
nature
therefore
what
to
the
common
mind
appears
miraculous
or
impossible
is
nevertheless
actually
ordinary
and
only
seems
to
the
common
mind
lack
of
knowledge
and
experience
the
fountain
of
youth
and
the
elixir
of
life
were
dreams
of
the
ancient
mystics
and
scientists
but
they
are
not
dreams
to
the
soul
that
has
found
them
they
are
divine
realities
marie
corelli
there
is
no
death
what
seems
so
is
transition
i
the
heroine
begins
her
story
it
is
difficult
at
all
times
to
write
or
speak
of
circumstances
which
though
perfectly
at
one
with
nature
appear
to
be
removed
from
natural
occurrences
apart
from
the
incredulity
with
which
the
narration
of
such
incidents
is
received
the
mere
idea
that
any
one
human
creature
should
be
fortunate
enough
to
secure
some
particular
advantage
which
others
through
their
own
indolence
or
indifference
have
missed
is
sufficient
to
excite
the
envy
of
the
weak
or
the
anger
of
the
ignorant
in
all
criticism
it
is
an
understood
thing
that
the
subject
to
be
criticised
must
be
under
the
critic
never
above
that
is
to
say
never
above
the
critic
ability
to
comprehend
therefore
as
it
is
impossible
that
an
outsider
should
enter
at
once
into
a
clear
understanding
of
the
mystic
world
around
him
it
follows
that
the
teachings
and
tenets
of
that
world
must
be
more
or
less
a
closed
book
to
such
an
one
a
book
moreover
which
he
seldom
cares
or
dares
to
try
and
open
in
this
way
and
for
this
reason
the
eastern
philosophers
and
sages
concealed
much
of
their
most
profound
knowledge
from
the
multitude
because
they
rightly
recognised
the
limitations
of
narrow
minds
and
prejudiced
opinions
what
the
fool
can
not
learn
he
laughs
at
thinking
that
by
his
laughter
he
shows
superiority
instead
of
latent
idiocy
and
so
it
has
happened
that
many
of
the
greatest
discoveries
of
science
though
fully
known
and
realised
in
the
past
by
the
initiated
few
were
never
disclosed
to
the
many
until
recent
years
when
telegraphy
and
are
accepted
facts
though
these
very
things
were
familiar
to
the
egyptian
priests
and
to
that
particular
sect
known
as
the
brethren
many
of
whom
used
the
ray
for
chemical
and
other
purposes
ages
before
the
coming
of
christ
wireless
telegraphy
was
also
an
ordinary
method
of
communication
between
them
and
they
had
their
for
it
in
high
towers
on
certain
points
of
land
as
we
have
now
but
if
they
had
made
their
scientific
attainments
known
to
the
multitude
of
their
day
they
would
have
been
judged
as
impostors
or
madmen
in
the
time
of
galileo
men
would
not
believe
that
the
earth
moved
round
the
sun
and
if
anyone
had
then
declared
that
messages
could
be
sent
from
one
ship
to
another
in
without
any
visible
means
of
communication
he
would
probably
have
been
put
to
torture
and
death
as
a
sorcerer
and
deliberate
misleader
of
the
public
in
the
same
way
those
who
write
of
spiritual
truths
and
the
psychic
control
of
our
are
as
foolishly
criticised
as
galileo
and
as
wrongfully
condemned
for
hundreds
of
years
man
vain
presumption
and
belief
in
his
own
infallibility
caused
him
to
remain
in
error
concerning
the
simplest
elements
of
astronomy
which
would
have
taught
him
the
true
position
of
the
sphere
upon
which
he
dwells
with
precisely
equal
obstinacy
man
lives
in
ignorance
of
his
own
highest
powers
because
he
will
not
take
the
trouble
to
study
the
elements
of
that
supreme
and
mental
science
which
would
enable
him
to
understand
his
own
essential
life
and
being
and
the
intention
of
his
creator
with
regard
to
his
progress
and
betterment
therefore
in
the
face
of
his
persistent
egotism
and
effrontery
and
his
continuous
denial
of
the
which
denial
is
absurdly
incongruous
seeing
that
all
his
religions
are
built
up
on
a
basis
it
is
generally
necessary
for
students
of
psychic
mysteries
to
guard
the
treasures
of
their
wisdom
from
profane
and
vulgar
scorn
a
scorn
which
amounts
in
their
eyes
to
blasphemy
for
centuries
it
has
been
their
custom
to
conceal
the
tenets
of
their
creed
from
the
common
knowledge
for
the
sake
of
conventions
because
they
would
or
might
be
shut
out
from
such
consolations
as
human
social
intercourse
can
give
if
their
spiritual
attainments
were
found
to
be
as
they
often
are
beyond
the
ordinary
thus
they
move
through
the
world
with
the
utmost
caution
and
instead
of
making
a
display
of
their
powers
they
if
they
are
true
to
their
faith
studiously
deny
the
idea
that
they
have
any
extraordinary
or
separate
knowledge
they
live
as
spectators
of
the
progress
or
decay
of
nations
and
they
have
no
desire
to
make
disciples
converts
or
confidants
they
submit
to
the
obligations
of
life
obey
all
civil
codes
and
are
blameless
and
generous
citizens
only
preserving
silence
in
regard
to
their
own
private
beliefs
and
giving
the
public
the
benefit
of
their
acquirements
up
to
a
certain
point
but
shutting
out
curiosity
where
they
do
not
wish
its
impertinent
eyes
to
this
the
creed
just
spoken
of
i
the
writer
of
this
present
narrative
belong
it
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
merely
human
dogma
and
yet
i
would
have
it
distinctly
understood
that
i
am
not
opposed
to
of
religion
save
where
they
overwhelm
religion
itself
and
allow
the
spirit
to
be
utterly
lost
in
the
letter
for
letter
killeth
the
spirit
giveth
life
so
far
as
a
may
make
a
way
for
truth
to
become
manifest
i
am
with
it
but
when
it
is
a
mere
sham
or
show
and
when
human
souls
are
lost
rather
than
saved
by
it
i
am
opposed
to
it
and
with
all
my
deficiencies
i
am
conscious
that
i
may
risk
the
chance
of
a
lower
world
disdain
seeing
that
the
world
without
end
is
open
to
me
in
its
imperishable
brightness
and
beauty
to
live
in
both
now
and
for
ever
no
one
can
cast
me
out
of
that
glorious
and
indestructible
universe
for
i
go
there
will
be
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
visions
and
communion
with
the
gods
and
so
i
will
fulfil
the
task
allotted
to
me
and
will
enter
at
once
upon
my
in
which
form
i
shall
endeavour
to
convey
to
my
readers
certain
facts
which
are
as
far
from
fiction
as
the
sayings
of
the
prophets
of
old
sayings
that
we
know
have
been
realised
by
the
science
of
every
great
truth
has
at
first
been
no
more
than
a
dream
that
is
to
say
a
thought
or
an
instinctive
perception
of
the
soul
reaching
after
its
own
immortal
heritage
and
what
the
soul
demands
it
receives
at
a
time
of
year
when
the
indolent
languors
of
an
exceptionally
warm
summer
disinclined
most
people
for
continuous
hard
work
and
when
those
who
could
afford
it
had
left
their
ordinary
avocations
for
the
joys
of
a
long
holiday
i
received
a
pressing
invitation
from
certain
persons
whom
i
had
met
by
chance
during
one
london
season
to
join
them
in
a
yachting
cruise
my
intending
host
was
an
exceedingly
rich
man
a
widower
with
one
daughter
a
delicate
and
ailing
creature
who
had
she
been
poor
would
have
been
irreverently
styled
tiresome
old
maid
but
who
by
reason
of
being
a
millionaire
sole
heiress
was
alluded
to
with
sycophantic
tenderness
by
all
and
sundry
as
miss
catherine
morton
harland
her
father
was
in
a
certain
sense
notorious
for
having
written
and
published
a
bitter
cold
and
pitiless
attack
on
religion
which
was
the
favourite
reading
of
many
scholars
and
literary
men
and
this
notable
performance
together
with
the
well
accredited
reports
of
his
almost
fabulous
wealth
secured
for
him
two
social
sets
the
one
composed
of
such
human
sharks
as
are
accustomed
to
swim
round
the
plutocrat
the
other
of
the
cynical
listless
portion
of
a
cultured
class
who
having
grown
utterly
tired
of
themselves
presumed
that
it
was
clever
to
be
equally
tired
of
god
i
was
surprised
that
such
a
man
as
he
was
should
think
of
including
me
among
his
guests
for
i
had
scarcely
exchanged
a
dozen
words
with
him
and
my
acquaintance
with
miss
harland
was
restricted
to
a
few
casual
condolences
with
her
respecting
the
state
of
her
health
yet
it
so
chanced
that
one
of
those
vague
impulses
to
which
we
can
give
no
name
but
which
often
play
an
important
part
in
the
building
up
of
our
moved
both
father
and
daughter
to
a
wish
for
my
company
moreover
the
wish
was
so
strong
that
though
on
first
receiving
their
invitation
i
had
refused
it
they
repeated
it
urgently
morton
harland
himself
pressing
it
upon
me
with
an
almost
imperative
insistence
you
want
rest
he
said
peering
at
me
narrowly
with
his
small
hard
brown
eyes
you
work
all
the
time
and
to
what
purpose
i
smiled
to
as
much
purpose
as
anyone
else
i
suppose
i
answered
but
to
put
it
plainly
i
work
because
i
love
work
the
lines
of
his
mouth
grew
harder
so
did
i
love
work
when
i
was
your
age
he
said
i
thought
i
could
carve
out
a
destiny
so
i
could
i
have
done
it
but
now
it
done
tired
i
sick
of
my
destiny
the
thing
i
carved
out
so
cleverly
it
has
the
stone
face
of
a
sphinx
and
its
eyes
are
blank
and
without
meaning
i
was
silent
my
silence
seemed
to
irritate
him
and
he
gave
me
a
sharp
enquiring
glance
do
you
hear
me
he
demanded
if
you
do
i
do
believe
you
understand
i
hear
and
i
quite
understand
i
replied
quietly
your
destiny
as
you
have
made
it
is
that
of
a
rich
man
and
you
do
not
care
about
it
i
think
that
quite
natural
he
laughed
harshly
there
you
are
again
he
exclaimed
up
in
the
air
and
riding
a
theory
like
a
witch
on
a
broomstick
it
not
natural
that
just
where
you
wrong
it
quite
if
a
man
has
plenty
of
money
he
ought
to
be
perfectly
happy
and
satisfied
he
can
get
everything
he
wants
he
can
move
the
whole
world
of
commerce
and
speculation
and
can
shake
the
tree
of
fortune
so
that
the
apples
shall
always
fall
at
his
own
feet
but
if
the
apples
are
tasteless
there
something
wrong
not
with
the
apples
i
said
oh
i
know
what
you
mean
you
would
say
the
fault
is
with
me
not
with
fortune
fruit
you
may
be
right
catherine
says
you
are
poor
mopish
catherine
always
ailing
always
querulous
come
and
cheer
her
but
i
ventured
to
say
i
hardly
know
her
that
true
but
she
has
taken
a
curious
fancy
to
you
she
has
very
few
fancies
nowadays
none
that
wealth
can
gratify
her
life
has
been
a
complete
disillusion
if
you
would
do
her
and
me
a
kindness
come
i
was
a
little
troubled
by
his
pertinacity
i
had
never
liked
morton
harland
his
reputation
both
as
a
man
of
wealth
and
a
man
of
letters
was
to
me
unenviable
he
did
no
particular
good
with
his
money
and
such
literary
talent
as
he
possessed
he
squandered
in
attacking
nobler
ideals
than
he
had
ever
been
able
to
attain
he
was
not
agreeable
to
look
at
either
his
pale
face
was
deeply
marked
by
lines
of
avarice
and
cunning
his
tall
lean
figure
had
an
aggressive
air
in
its
very
attitude
and
his
unkind
mouth
never
failed
whether
in
speaking
or
smiling
to
express
a
sneer
apparently
he
guessed
the
vague
tenor
of
my
thoughts
for
he
went
on
do
be
afraid
of
me
i
not
an
ogre
and
i
sha
eat
you
you
think
me
a
disagreeable
man
well
so
i
am
i
had
enough
in
my
life
to
make
me
disagreeable
and
here
he
paused
passing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
with
a
worried
and
impatient
gesture
i
had
an
unexpected
blow
just
lately
the
doctors
tell
me
that
i
have
a
mortal
disease
for
which
there
is
no
remedy
i
may
live
on
for
several
years
or
i
may
die
suddenly
it
all
a
matter
of
care
or
chance
i
want
to
forget
the
sad
news
for
a
while
if
i
can
i
told
catherine
and
i
suppose
added
to
her
usual
burden
of
vapours
and
melancholy
so
we
a
couple
of
miserable
wretches
it
not
very
unselfish
of
us
to
ask
you
to
come
and
join
us
under
such
circumstances
as
he
spoke
my
mind
suddenly
made
itself
up
i
would
go
why
not
a
cruise
on
a
magnificent
steam
yacht
replete
with
every
comfort
and
luxury
was
surely
a
fairly
pleasant
way
of
taking
a
holiday
even
with
two
invalids
for
company
i
sorry
i
said
as
gently
as
i
could
very
sorry
that
you
are
perhaps
the
doctors
may
be
mistaken
they
are
not
always
infallible
many
of
their
doomed
patients
have
recovered
in
spite
of
their
verdict
and
as
you
and
miss
harland
wish
it
so
much
i
will
certainly
come
his
frowning
face
lightened
and
for
a
moment
looked
almost
kind
that
right
he
said
the
fresh
air
and
the
sea
will
do
you
good
as
for
ourselves
sickly
people
though
we
are
we
shall
not
obtrude
our
ailments
upon
your
attention
at
least
shall
not
catherine
may
she
has
got
into
an
unfortunate
habit
of
talking
about
her
aches
and
pains
and
if
her
acquaintances
have
no
aches
and
pains
to
discuss
with
her
she
is
at
a
loss
for
conversation
however
we
shall
do
our
best
to
make
the
time
go
easily
with
you
there
will
be
no
other
company
on
board
except
my
private
secretary
and
my
attendant
physician
both
decent
fellows
who
know
their
place
and
keep
it
the
hard
look
settled
again
in
his
eyes
and
his
ugly
mouth
closed
firmly
in
its
usual
cruel
line
my
subconscious
dislike
of
him
gave
me
a
sharp
thrust
of
regret
that
after
all
i
had
accepted
his
invitation
i
was
going
to
scotland
for
a
change
i
murmured
hesitatingly
were
you
then
our
plans
coincide
we
join
the
yacht
at
rothesay
you
can
meet
us
there
i
propose
a
cruise
among
the
western
isles
the
hebrides
and
possibly
on
to
norway
and
its
fjords
what
do
you
say
my
heart
thrilled
with
a
sudden
sense
of
expectant
joy
in
my
fancy
i
already
saw
the
summits
of
the
highland
hills
bathed
in
soft
climbing
mists
of
amethyst
and
rose
the
lovely
purple
light
that
dances
on
the
mountain
lochs
at
the
sinking
of
the
sun
the
exquisite
beauty
of
wild
moor
and
rocky
foreland
and
almost
i
was
disposed
to
think
this
antipathetic
millionaire
an
angel
of
blessing
in
disguise
it
will
be
delightful
i
said
with
real
fervour
i
shall
love
it
i
glad
you
are
going
to
keep
to
northern
seas
northern
seas
are
the
only
seas
possible
for
summer
he
replied
with
the
winter
one
goes
south
as
a
matter
of
course
though
i
not
sure
that
it
is
always
advisable
i
have
found
the
mediterranean
tiresome
very
often
he
broke
off
and
seemed
to
lose
himself
for
a
moment
in
a
tangle
of
vexed
thought
then
he
resumed
quickly
well
next
week
then
rothesay
bay
and
the
yacht
things
being
thus
settled
we
shook
hands
and
parted
in
the
interval
between
his
visit
and
my
departure
from
home
i
had
plenty
to
do
and
i
heard
no
more
of
the
harlands
except
that
i
received
a
little
note
from
miss
catherine
expressing
her
pleasure
that
i
had
agreed
to
accompany
them
on
their
cruise
you
will
be
very
dull
i
fear
she
wrote
kindly
but
not
so
dull
as
we
should
be
without
you
this
was
a
gracious
phrase
which
meant
as
much
or
as
little
as
most
such
phrases
of
a
conventionally
amiable
character
dulness
however
is
a
condition
of
brain
and
body
of
which
i
am
seldom
conscious
so
that
the
suggestion
of
its
possibility
did
not
disturb
my
outlook
having
resolved
to
go
i
equally
resolved
to
enjoy
the
trip
to
the
utmost
limit
of
my
capacity
for
enjoyment
which
fortunately
for
myself
is
very
great
before
my
departure
from
home
i
had
to
listen
of
course
to
the
usual
croaking
chorus
of
acquaintances
in
the
neighbourhood
who
were
not
going
yachting
and
who
according
to
their
own
assertion
never
would
on
any
account
go
yachting
there
is
a
tendency
in
many
persons
to
decry
every
pleasure
which
they
have
no
chance
of
sharing
and
this
was
not
lacking
among
my
provincial
gossips
the
weather
has
been
so
fine
lately
that
we
sure
to
have
a
break
soon
said
one
i
expect
you
meet
gales
at
sea
i
hear
said
another
that
heavy
rains
are
threatening
the
west
coast
of
scotland
such
a
bore
yachting
declared
a
worthy
woman
who
had
never
been
on
a
yacht
in
her
life
the
people
on
board
get
sick
of
each
company
in
a
week
well
you
ought
to
pity
me
very
much
then
i
said
laughing
according
to
your
ideas
a
yachting
cruise
appears
to
be
the
last
possible
form
of
physical
suffering
that
can
be
inflicted
on
any
human
being
but
i
shall
hope
to
come
safely
out
of
it
all
the
same
my
visitors
gave
me
a
wry
smile
it
was
quite
easy
to
see
that
they
envied
what
they
considered
my
good
fortune
in
getting
a
holiday
under
the
most
luxurious
circumstances
without
its
costing
me
a
penny
this
was
the
only
view
they
took
of
it
it
is
the
only
view
people
generally
take
of
any
situation
namely
the
financial
side
the
night
before
i
left
home
was
to
me
a
memorable
one
nothing
of
any
outward
or
apparent
interest
happened
and
i
was
quite
alone
yet
i
was
conscious
of
a
singular
elation
of
both
mind
and
body
as
though
i
were
surrounded
by
a
vibrating
atmosphere
of
light
and
joy
it
was
an
impression
that
came
upon
me
suddenly
seeming
to
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
my
own
identity
yet
withal
it
was
still
so
personal
that
i
felt
eager
to
praise
for
such
a
rich
inflow
of
happiness
the
impression
was
purely
psychic
i
knew
but
it
was
worth
a
thousand
gifts
of
material
good
nothing
seemed
sad
nothing
seemed
difficult
in
the
whole
universe
every
shadow
of
trouble
seemed
swept
away
from
a
shining
sky
of
peace
i
threw
open
the
lattice
window
of
my
study
and
stepping
out
on
the
balcony
which
overhung
the
garden
i
stood
there
dreamily
looking
out
upon
the
night
there
was
no
moon
only
a
million
quivering
points
of
light
flashing
from
the
crowded
stars
in
a
heaven
of
dusky
blue
the
air
was
warm
and
fragrant
with
the
sweet
scent
of
stocks
and
heliotrope
there
was
a
great
silence
for
it
was
fully
midnight
and
not
even
the
drowsy
twitter
of
a
bird
broke
the
intense
quiet
the
world
was
asleep
or
seemed
so
although
for
fifty
living
organisms
in
nature
that
sleep
there
are
a
thousand
that
wake
to
whom
night
is
the
working
day
i
listened
and
fancied
i
could
hear
the
delicate
murmuring
of
voices
hidden
among
the
leaves
and
behind
the
trees
and
the
thrill
of
soft
music
flowing
towards
me
on
the
of
the
air
it
was
one
of
those
supreme
moments
when
i
almost
thought
i
had
made
some
marked
progress
towards
the
attainment
of
my
highest
aims
when
the
time
i
had
spent
and
the
patience
i
had
exercised
in
cultivating
and
training
what
may
be
called
the
inward
powers
of
sight
and
hearing
were
about
to
be
rewarded
by
a
full
opening
to
my
striving
spirit
of
the
gates
which
had
till
now
been
only
set
ajar
i
knew
for
i
had
studied
and
proved
the
truth
that
every
bodily
sense
we
possess
is
simply
an
imperfect
outcome
of
its
original
and
existent
faculty
in
the
soul
that
our
bodily
ears
are
only
the
material
expressions
of
that
spiritual
hearing
which
is
fine
and
keen
enough
to
catch
the
lightest
angel
whisper
that
our
eyes
are
but
the
outward
semblance
of
those
brilliant
inner
orbs
of
vision
which
are
made
to
look
upon
the
supernal
glories
of
heaven
itself
without
fear
or
flinching
and
that
our
very
sense
of
touch
is
but
a
rough
and
uncertain
handling
of
perishable
things
as
compared
with
that
sure
and
delicate
contact
of
the
soul
personal
being
with
the
etheric
substances
pertaining
to
itself
despite
my
eager
expectation
however
nothing
more
was
granted
to
me
then
but
just
that
exquisite
sensation
of
pure
joy
which
like
a
rain
of
light
bathed
every
fibre
of
my
being
it
was
enough
i
told
myself
surely
enough
and
yet
it
seemed
to
me
there
should
be
something
more
it
was
a
promise
with
the
fulfilment
close
at
hand
yet
undeclared
like
a
cloud
with
the
sun
behind
it
but
i
was
given
no
solution
of
the
rapturous
mystery
surrounding
me
and
granting
my
soul
an
absolute
freedom
it
could
plunge
no
deeper
than
through
the
immensity
of
stars
to
immensities
still
more
profound
there
to
dream
and
hope
and
wait
for
years
i
had
done
this
for
years
i
had
worked
and
prayed
watching
the
pageant
of
poor
human
pride
and
vanity
drift
past
me
like
shadows
on
the
shore
of
a
dead
sea
succeeding
little
by
little
in
threading
my
way
through
the
closest
labyrinths
of
life
and
finding
out
the
beautiful
reasons
of
living
and
every
now
and
then
as
i
had
felt
myself
on
the
verge
of
a
discovery
which
in
its
divine
simplicity
should
make
all
problems
clear
and
all
difficulties
easy
when
i
had
been
gently
but
firmly
held
back
by
a
force
invisible
and
warned
far
and
no
farther
to
oppose
this
force
or
make
any
personal
effort
to
rebel
against
it
is
no
part
of
my
faith
therefore
at
such
moments
i
had
always
yielded
instantly
and
obediently
as
i
yielded
now
i
was
not
allowed
to
fathom
the
occult
source
of
my
happiness
but
the
happiness
remained
and
when
i
retired
to
rest
it
was
with
more
than
ordinary
gratitude
that
i
said
my
usual
brief
prayer
for
the
day
that
is
past
i
thank
thee
o
god
my
father
for
the
night
that
has
come
i
thank
thee
as
one
with
thee
and
with
nature
i
gratefully
take
the
rest
thou
hast
lovingly
ordained
whether
i
sleep
or
wake
my
body
and
soul
are
thine
do
with
them
as
thou
wilt
for
thy
command
is
my
joy
amen
i
slept
as
soundly
and
peacefully
as
a
child
and
the
next
day
started
on
my
journey
in
the
brightest
of
bright
summer
weather
a
friend
travelled
with
me
one
of
those
amiable
women
to
whom
life
is
always
pleasant
because
of
the
pleasantness
in
their
own
natures
she
had
taken
a
house
for
the
season
in
and
i
had
arranged
to
join
her
there
when
my
trip
with
the
harlands
was
over
or
rather
i
should
say
when
they
had
grown
weary
of
me
and
i
of
them
the
latter
chance
was
thought
my
friend
whom
i
will
call
francesca
most
likely
there
no
greater
boredom
she
declared
than
the
society
of
an
imaginative
invalid
such
company
will
not
be
restful
to
you
it
will
tire
you
out
morton
harland
himself
may
be
really
ill
as
he
says
i
should
wonder
if
he
is
for
he
looks
it
but
his
daughter
has
nothing
whatever
the
matter
with
her
except
nerves
nerves
are
bad
enough
i
said
nerves
can
be
conquered
she
answered
with
a
bright
smile
of
wholesome
conviction
nerves
are
generally
well
just
selfishness
there
was
some
truth
in
this
but
we
did
not
argue
the
point
further
we
were
too
much
engrossed
with
the
interests
of
our
journey
north
and
with
the
entertainment
provided
for
us
by
our
the
train
for
edinburgh
and
glasgow
was
crowded
with
men
of
that
particular
social
class
who
find
an
intelligent
way
of
using
their
brain
and
muscle
and
cumbered
the
ground
in
every
corner
it
wanted
yet
several
days
to
the
famous
twelfth
of
august
but
the
weather
was
so
exceptionally
fine
and
brilliant
that
the
exodus
from
town
had
begun
earlier
than
was
actually
necessary
for
the
purposes
of
slaughter
francesca
and
i
studied
the
faces
and
figures
of
our
companions
with
lively
and
unabated
interest
we
had
a
reserved
compartment
to
ourselves
and
from
its
secluded
privacy
we
watched
the
restless
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
adjacent
corridor
of
sundry
male
creatures
who
seemed
to
have
nothing
whatever
to
think
about
but
the
day
newspaper
and
nothing
to
do
but
smoke
i
am
sure
said
francesca
suddenly
that
in
the
beginning
of
creation
we
were
all
beasts
and
birds
of
prey
eating
each
other
up
and
tearing
each
other
to
pieces
the
love
of
prey
is
in
us
still
not
in
you
surely
i
queried
with
a
smile
oh
i
am
not
talking
or
thinking
of
myself
i
just
a
woman
so
are
you
a
woman
and
something
more
perhaps
something
not
like
the
rest
of
us
here
her
kind
eyes
regarded
me
a
trifle
wistfully
i
quite
make
you
out
sometimes
i
wish
i
could
but
apart
from
you
and
me
look
at
a
few
of
these
men
one
has
just
passed
our
window
who
has
the
exact
physiognomy
of
a
hawk
cruel
eyes
and
sharp
nose
like
a
voracious
beak
another
i
noticed
a
minute
ago
with
a
perfectly
face
he
does
not
look
rightly
placed
on
two
legs
his
natural
attitude
is
on
four
legs
grunting
with
his
snout
in
the
gutter
i
laughed
you
are
a
severe
critic
francesca
not
i
not
criticising
at
all
but
i
ca
help
seeing
resemblances
and
sometimes
they
are
quite
appalling
now
you
for
instance
here
she
laid
a
hand
tentatively
on
mine
you
in
your
mysterious
ideas
of
religion
actually
believe
that
persons
who
lead
evil
lives
and
encourage
evil
thoughts
descend
the
scale
from
which
they
have
risen
and
go
back
to
the
lowest
forms
of
life
i
do
believe
that
certainly
i
answered
but
me
no
buts
she
interrupted
i
tell
you
there
are
people
in
this
world
whom
i
see
in
the
very
act
of
descending
and
it
makes
me
grow
cold
i
could
well
understand
her
feeling
i
had
experienced
it
often
nothing
has
ever
filled
me
with
a
more
hopeless
sense
of
inadequacy
and
utter
uselessness
than
to
watch
as
i
am
often
compelled
to
watch
the
deplorable
results
of
the
determined
choice
made
by
certain
human
beings
to
go
backward
and
downward
rather
than
forward
and
upward
a
choice
in
which
no
outside
advice
can
be
of
any
avail
because
they
will
not
take
it
even
if
it
is
offered
it
is
a
matter
for
their
own
wills
to
determine
and
no
power
human
or
divine
can
alter
the
course
they
elect
to
adopt
as
well
expect
that
god
would
revert
his
law
of
gravitation
to
save
the
silly
suicide
who
leaps
to
destruction
from
tower
or
steeple
as
that
he
would
change
the
eternal
working
of
his
higher
spiritual
law
to
rescue
the
resolved
soul
which
knowing
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
deliberately
prefers
evil
if
an
angel
of
light
a
veritable
of
the
morning
rebels
he
must
fall
from
heaven
there
is
no
alternative
until
of
his
own
he
chooses
to
rise
again
my
friend
and
i
had
often
talked
together
on
these
knotty
points
which
tangled
up
what
should
be
the
straightness
of
many
a
life
career
and
as
we
mutually
knew
each
other
opinions
we
did
not
discuss
them
at
the
moment
time
passed
quickly
the
train
rushed
farther
and
farther
north
and
by
six
on
that
warm
sunshiny
afternoon
we
were
in
the
grimy
city
of
glasgow
from
whence
we
went
on
to
a
still
grimier
quarter
greenock
where
we
put
up
for
the
night
the
hotel
was
a
sorry
affair
but
we
were
too
tired
to
mind
either
a
bad
dinner
or
uncomfortable
rooms
and
went
to
bed
glad
of
any
place
wherein
to
sleep
next
morning
we
woke
up
very
early
refreshed
and
joyous
in
time
to
see
the
sun
rise
in
a
warm
mist
of
gold
over
a
huge
outside
greenock
harbour
a
sight
which
in
its
way
was
very
fine
and
rather
suggestive
of
a
turner
picture
dear
old
sol
said
francesca
shading
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
the
dazzle
of
glory
his
mission
is
to
sustain
life
and
the
object
of
that
bathed
in
all
his
golden
rays
is
to
destroy
it
what
unscrupulous
villains
men
are
why
can
not
nations
resolve
on
peace
and
amity
and
if
differences
arise
agree
to
settle
them
by
arbitration
it
such
a
pagan
and
brutal
thing
to
kill
thousands
of
innocent
men
just
because
governments
quarrel
i
entirely
agree
with
you
i
said
all
the
same
i
do
approve
of
governments
that
preach
peace
while
they
drain
the
people
pockets
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
armaments
after
the
german
fashion
let
us
be
ready
with
adequate
defences
but
it
surely
very
foolish
to
cripple
our
nation
at
home
by
way
of
preparation
for
wars
which
may
never
happen
and
yet
they
may
happen
said
francesca
her
eyes
still
dreamily
watching
the
sunlit
heavens
everything
in
the
universe
is
engaged
in
some
sort
of
a
fight
so
it
seems
to
me
the
tiniest
insects
are
for
ever
combating
each
other
in
the
very
channels
of
our
own
blood
the
poisonous
and
germs
are
constantly
striving
for
the
mastery
and
how
can
we
escape
the
general
ordainment
life
itself
is
a
continual
battle
between
good
and
evil
and
if
it
were
not
so
we
should
have
no
object
in
living
the
whole
business
is
evidently
intended
to
be
a
dose
conflict
to
the
end
there
is
no
end
i
said
she
looked
at
me
almost
compassionately
so
you
imagine
i
smiled
so
i
know
a
vague
expression
flitted
over
her
face
an
expression
with
which
i
had
become
familiar
she
was
a
most
lovable
and
intelligent
creature
but
she
could
not
think
very
far
the
effort
wearied
and
perplexed
her
well
then
it
must
be
an
everlasting
skirmish
i
suppose
she
said
laughingly
i
wonder
if
our
souls
will
ever
get
tired
do
you
think
god
ever
gets
tired
i
asked
she
looked
startled
then
amused
he
ought
to
she
declared
with
vivacity
i
do
mean
to
be
irreverent
but
really
what
with
all
the
living
things
in
all
the
millions
of
worlds
trying
to
get
what
they
ought
not
to
have
and
wailing
and
howling
when
they
are
disappointed
of
their
wishes
he
ought
to
be
very
very
tired
but
he
is
not
i
said
if
he
were
there
would
indeed
be
an
end
of
all
should
the
creator
be
weary
of
his
work
the
work
would
be
undone
i
wish
we
thought
of
this
more
often
she
put
her
arm
round
me
kindly
you
are
a
strange
creature
she
said
you
think
a
great
deal
too
much
of
all
these
abstruse
subjects
after
all
i
glad
you
are
going
on
this
cruise
with
the
harland
people
they
will
bring
you
down
from
the
spheres
with
a
run
they
will
i
sure
you
hear
no
conversation
that
does
not
turn
on
baths
medicines
massage
and
general
and
when
you
come
on
to
stay
with
me
in
you
be
quite
commonplace
and
sensible
i
smiled
the
dear
francesca
always
associated
commonplace
and
sensible
together
as
though
they
were
fitted
to
companion
each
other
the
complete
reverse
is
of
course
the
case
for
the
is
generally
nothing
more
than
the
daily
routine
of
body
which
is
instinctively
followed
by
beasts
and
birds
as
equally
as
by
man
and
has
no
more
to
do
with
real
or
pure
mentality
than
the
ticking
of
a
watch
has
to
do
with
the
enormous
forces
of
the
sun
what
we
call
actual
is
the
perception
of
the
soul
a
perception
which
can
not
be
limited
to
things
which
are
merely
material
inasmuch
as
it
passes
beyond
outward
needs
and
appearances
and
reaches
to
the
causes
which
create
those
outward
needs
and
appearances
i
was
however
satisfied
to
leave
my
friend
in
possession
of
the
field
of
argument
the
more
readily
as
our
parting
from
each
other
was
so
near
at
hand
we
journeyed
together
by
the
steamer
to
rothesay
where
on
entering
the
beautiful
bay
crowded
at
this
season
with
pleasure
craft
the
first
object
which
attracted
our
attention
was
the
very
vessel
for
which
i
was
bound
the
one
of
the
most
magnificent
yachts
ever
built
to
gratify
the
whim
of
a
millionaire
tourists
on
board
our
steamer
at
once
took
up
positions
where
they
could
obtain
the
best
view
of
her
and
many
were
the
comments
we
heard
concerning
her
size
and
the
beauty
of
her
lines
as
she
rode
at
anchor
on
the
sunlit
water
you
be
in
a
floating
palace
said
francesca
as
we
approached
rothesay
pier
and
she
bade
me
an
affectionate
adieu
now
take
care
of
yourself
and
do
fly
away
to
the
moon
on
what
you
call
an
etheric
vibration
remember
if
you
get
tired
of
the
harlands
to
come
to
me
at
once
i
promised
and
we
parted
on
landing
at
rothesay
i
was
almost
immediately
approached
by
a
sailor
from
the
who
spying
my
name
on
my
luggage
quickly
possessed
himself
of
it
and
told
me
the
motor
launch
was
in
waiting
to
take
me
over
to
the
yacht
i
was
on
my
way
across
the
sparkling
bay
before
the
started
out
again
from
the
pier
and
francesca
standing
on
the
steamer
deck
waved
to
me
a
smiling
farewell
as
i
went
in
about
ten
minutes
i
was
on
board
the
shaking
hands
with
morton
harland
and
his
daughter
catherine
who
wrapped
up
in
shawls
on
a
deck
chair
looked
as
though
she
were
guarding
herself
from
the
chills
of
a
rigorous
winter
rather
than
basking
in
the
warm
sunshine
of
a
summer
morning
you
look
very
well
she
said
in
tones
of
plaintive
amiability
and
so
wonderfully
bright
it
such
a
bright
day
i
answered
feeling
as
if
i
ought
somehow
to
apologise
for
a
healthy
appearance
one
ca
help
being
happy
she
sighed
and
smiled
faintly
and
her
maid
appearing
at
that
moment
to
take
my
travelling
bag
and
wraps
i
was
shown
the
cabin
or
rather
the
which
was
to
be
mine
during
the
cruise
it
was
a
luxurious
double
apartment
bedroom
and
together
divided
only
by
the
hanging
folds
of
a
rich
crimson
silk
curtain
and
exquisitely
fitted
with
white
enamelled
furniture
ornamented
with
silver
the
bed
had
no
resemblance
whatever
to
a
ship
berth
but
was
an
elaborate
affair
canopied
in
white
silk
embroidered
with
roses
the
carpet
was
of
a
thick
softness
into
which
my
feet
sank
as
though
it
were
moss
and
a
tall
silver
and
crystal
vase
full
of
gorgeous
roses
was
placed
at
the
foot
of
a
standing
mirror
framed
in
silver
so
that
the
blossoms
were
reflected
double
the
was
provided
with
easy
chairs
a
and
a
small
piano
and
here
too
masses
of
roses
showed
their
fair
faces
from
every
corner
it
was
all
so
charming
that
i
could
not
help
uttering
an
exclamation
of
delight
and
the
maid
who
was
unpacking
my
things
smiled
sympathetically
it
perfectly
lovely
i
said
turning
to
her
with
eagerness
quite
a
little
fairyland
but
is
this
miss
harland
cabin
oh
dear
no
miss
she
replied
miss
harland
would
have
all
these
things
about
her
on
any
account
there
are
no
carpets
or
curtains
in
miss
harland
rooms
she
thinks
them
very
unhealthy
she
has
only
a
bit
of
matting
on
the
floor
and
an
iron
bedstead
all
very
plain
and
as
for
roses
she
would
have
a
rose
near
her
for
ever
so
she
ca
bear
the
smell
of
them
i
made
no
comment
i
was
too
enchanted
with
my
surroundings
for
the
moment
to
consider
how
uncomfortable
my
hostess
chose
to
make
herself
who
arranged
these
rooms
i
asked
harland
gave
orders
to
the
steward
to
make
them
as
pretty
as
he
could
said
the
maid
john
and
she
blushed
has
a
lot
of
taste
i
smiled
i
saw
at
once
how
matters
were
between
her
and
john
just
then
there
was
a
sound
of
thudding
and
grinding
above
my
head
and
i
realised
that
we
were
beginning
to
weigh
anchor
quickly
tying
on
my
yachting
cap
and
veil
i
hurried
on
deck
and
was
soon
standing
beside
my
host
who
seemed
pleased
at
the
alacrity
with
which
i
had
joined
him
and
i
watched
with
feelings
of
indescribable
exhilaration
the
being
loosed
from
her
moorings
steam
was
up
and
in
a
very
short
time
her
bowsprit
swung
round
and
pointed
outward
from
the
bay
quivering
like
an
eager
ready
to
start
she
sprang
forward
and
then
with
a
stately
sweeping
curve
glided
across
the
water
catting
it
into
bright
wavelets
with
her
keel
and
churning
a
path
behind
her
of
opalescent
foam
we
were
off
on
our
voyage
of
pleasure
at
last
a
voyage
which
the
fates
had
determined
should
for
one
adventurer
at
least
lead
to
strange
regions
as
yet
unexplored
but
no
premonitory
sign
was
given
to
me
or
suggestion
that
i
might
be
the
one
chosen
to
sail
perilous
seas
of
fairy
lands
forlorn
for
in
spiritual
things
of
high
import
the
soul
that
is
most
concerned
is
always
the
least
expectant
ii
the
fairy
ship
i
was
introduced
that
evening
at
dinner
to
harland
physician
and
also
to
his
private
secretary
i
was
not
greatly
prepossessed
in
favour
of
either
of
these
gentlemen
brayle
was
a
dark
slim
man
of
middle
age
with
expressionless
brown
eyes
and
sleek
black
hair
which
was
carefully
brushed
and
parted
down
the
middle
he
was
quiet
and
in
manner
and
yet
i
thought
i
could
see
that
he
was
fully
alive
to
the
advantages
of
his
position
as
travelling
medical
adviser
to
an
american
millionaire
i
have
not
mentioned
till
now
that
morton
harland
was
an
american
i
was
always
rather
in
the
habit
of
forgetting
the
fact
as
he
had
long
ago
forsworn
his
nationality
and
had
naturalised
himself
as
a
british
subject
but
he
had
made
his
vast
fortune
in
america
and
was
still
the
controlling
magnate
of
many
large
financial
interests
in
the
states
he
was
however
much
more
english
than
american
for
he
had
been
educated
at
oxford
and
as
a
young
man
had
been
always
associated
with
english
society
and
english
ways
he
had
married
an
english
wife
who
died
when
their
first
child
his
daughter
was
born
and
he
was
wont
to
set
down
all
miss
mopish
languors
to
a
delicacy
inherited
from
her
mother
and
to
lack
of
a
mother
care
in
childhood
in
my
opinion
catherine
was
robust
enough
but
it
was
evident
that
from
a
very
early
age
she
had
been
given
her
own
way
to
the
fullest
extent
and
had
been
so
accustomed
to
have
every
little
ailment
exaggerated
and
made
the
most
of
that
she
had
grown
to
believe
health
of
body
and
mind
as
impossible
to
the
human
being
brayle
i
soon
perceived
lent
himself
to
this
attitude
and
i
did
not
like
the
covert
gleam
of
his
eyes
as
he
glanced
rapidly
from
father
to
daughter
in
the
pauses
of
conversation
watching
them
as
narrowly
as
a
cat
might
watch
a
couple
of
unwary
mice
the
secretary
swinton
was
a
pale
young
man
with
a
somewhat
servile
demeanour
under
which
he
concealed
an
inordinately
good
opinion
of
himself
his
ideas
were
centred
in
and
bounded
by
the
art
of
stenography
he
was
an
adept
in
shorthand
and
typewriting
could
jot
down
i
forget
how
many
crowds
of
jostling
words
a
minute
and
never
made
a
mistake
he
was
a
model
of
punctuality
and
dispatch
of
respectfulness
and
obedience
but
he
was
no
more
than
a
machine
he
could
not
be
moved
to
a
spontaneous
utterance
or
a
spontaneous
smile
unless
both
smile
and
utterance
were
the
result
of
some
pleasantness
affecting
himself
neither
brayle
nor
swinton
were
men
whom
one
could
positively
like
or
dislike
they
simply
had
the
power
of
creating
an
atmosphere
in
which
my
spirit
found
itself
swimming
like
a
in
a
bowl
wondering
how
it
got
in
and
how
it
could
get
out
as
i
sat
rather
silently
at
table
i
felt
rather
than
saw
brayle
regarding
me
with
a
kind
of
perplexed
curiosity
i
was
as
fully
aware
of
his
sensations
as
of
my
own
i
knew
that
my
presence
irritated
him
though
he
was
not
clever
enough
to
explain
even
to
himself
the
cause
of
his
irritation
so
far
as
swinton
was
concerned
he
was
comfortably
wrapped
up
in
a
pachydermatous
hide
of
so
that
he
thought
nothing
about
me
one
way
or
the
other
except
as
a
guest
of
his
patrons
and
one
therefore
to
whom
he
was
bound
to
be
civil
but
with
brayle
it
was
otherwise
i
was
a
puzzle
to
him
and
after
a
brief
study
of
me
an
annoyance
he
forced
himself
into
conversation
with
me
however
and
we
interchanged
a
few
remarks
on
the
weather
and
on
the
various
beauties
of
the
coast
along
which
we
had
been
sailing
all
day
i
see
that
you
care
very
much
for
fine
scenery
he
said
few
women
do
really
and
i
smiled
is
admiration
of
the
beautiful
a
special
privilege
of
men
only
it
should
be
he
answered
with
a
little
bow
we
are
the
admirers
of
your
sex
i
made
no
answer
harland
looked
at
me
with
a
somewhat
quizzical
air
you
are
not
a
believer
in
compliments
he
said
was
it
a
compliment
i
asked
laughingly
i
afraid
i
very
dense
i
did
not
see
that
it
was
meant
as
one
brayle
dark
brows
drew
together
in
a
slight
frown
with
that
expression
on
his
face
he
looked
very
much
like
an
italian
poisoner
of
old
time
the
kind
of
man
whom
caesar
borgia
might
have
employed
to
give
the
happy
dispatch
to
his
enemies
by
some
sure
and
undiscoverable
means
known
only
to
intricate
chemistry
presently
harland
spoke
again
while
he
peeled
a
pear
slowly
and
delicately
with
a
deft
movement
of
his
fruit
knife
that
suggested
cruelty
and
the
flaying
alive
of
some
sentient
thing
our
little
friend
is
of
a
rather
strange
disposition
he
observed
she
has
the
indifference
of
an
philosopher
to
the
saying
of
speeches
that
are
merely
socially
agreeable
she
is
ardent
in
soul
but
suspicious
in
mind
she
imagines
that
a
pleasant
word
may
often
be
used
to
cover
a
treacherous
action
and
if
a
man
is
as
rude
and
blunt
as
myself
for
example
she
prefers
that
he
should
be
rude
and
blunt
rather
than
that
he
should
attempt
to
conceal
his
roughness
by
an
amiability
which
it
is
not
his
nature
to
feel
here
he
looked
up
at
me
from
the
careful
scrutiny
of
his
nearly
flayed
pear
is
that
so
certainly
i
answered
but
that
not
a
or
original
attitude
of
mind
the
corners
of
his
ugly
mouth
curled
satirically
pardon
me
dear
lady
it
is
the
normal
and
strictly
reasonable
attitude
of
the
healthy
human
pigmy
is
that
it
should
accept
as
gospel
all
that
it
is
told
of
a
nature
soothing
and
agreeable
to
itself
it
should
believe
among
other
things
that
it
is
a
very
precious
pigmy
among
natural
forces
destined
to
be
immortal
and
to
share
with
divine
intelligence
the
privileges
of
heaven
put
out
by
the
merest
trifle
troubled
by
a
spasm
driven
almost
to
howling
by
a
toothache
and
generally
helpless
in
all
very
aggravated
adverse
circumstances
it
should
still
console
itself
with
the
idea
that
its
being
its
proportions
and
perfections
are
superb
enough
to
draw
down
deity
into
a
human
shape
as
a
creature
of
human
necessities
in
order
that
it
the
pigmy
should
claim
kinship
with
the
divine
now
and
for
ever
what
gorgeous
blasphemy
in
such
a
scheme
what
magnificent
arrogance
i
was
silent
but
i
could
almost
hear
my
heart
beating
with
suppressed
emotion
i
knew
morton
harland
was
an
atheist
so
far
as
atheism
is
possible
to
any
creature
born
of
spirit
as
well
as
matter
but
i
did
not
think
he
would
air
his
opinions
so
openly
and
at
once
before
me
the
first
evening
of
my
stay
on
board
his
yacht
i
saw
however
that
he
spoke
in
this
way
hoping
to
move
me
to
an
answering
argument
for
the
amusement
of
himself
and
the
other
two
men
present
and
therefore
i
did
what
was
incumbent
upon
me
to
do
in
such
a
situation
held
my
peace
brayle
watched
me
curiously
and
poor
catherine
harland
turned
her
plaintive
eyes
upon
me
full
of
alarm
she
had
learned
to
dread
her
father
fondness
for
starting
topics
which
led
to
religious
discussions
of
a
somewhat
heated
nature
but
as
i
did
not
speak
harland
was
placed
in
the
embarrassing
position
of
a
person
propounding
a
theory
which
no
one
shows
any
eagerness
to
accept
or
to
deny
and
looking
slightly
confused
he
went
on
in
a
lighter
and
more
casual
way
i
had
a
friend
once
at
oxford
a
wonderful
fellow
full
of
strange
dreams
and
occult
fancies
he
was
one
of
those
who
believed
in
the
divine
half
of
man
he
used
to
study
curious
old
books
and
manuscripts
till
long
past
midnight
and
never
seemed
tired
his
father
had
lived
by
choice
in
some
desert
corner
of
egypt
for
forty
years
and
in
egypt
this
boy
had
been
born
of
his
mother
he
never
spoke
his
father
died
suddenly
and
left
him
a
large
fortune
under
trustees
till
he
came
of
age
with
instructions
that
he
was
to
be
taken
to
england
and
educated
at
oxford
and
that
when
he
came
into
possession
of
his
money
he
was
to
be
left
free
to
do
as
he
liked
with
it
i
met
him
when
he
was
almost
through
his
university
course
i
was
only
two
or
three
years
his
senior
but
he
always
looked
much
younger
than
i
and
he
was
as
we
all
said
as
uncanny
as
our
little
friend
here
indicating
me
by
a
nod
of
his
head
and
a
smile
which
was
meant
to
be
kindly
he
never
practised
or
for
anything
and
yet
all
things
came
easily
to
him
he
was
as
magnificent
in
his
sports
as
he
was
in
his
studies
and
i
remember
how
well
i
remember
it
that
there
came
a
time
at
last
when
we
all
grew
afraid
of
him
if
we
saw
him
coming
along
the
we
avoided
him
he
had
something
of
terror
as
well
as
admiration
for
us
and
though
i
was
of
his
college
and
constantly
thrown
into
association
with
him
i
soon
became
infected
with
the
general
scare
one
night
he
stopped
me
in
the
quadrangle
where
he
had
his
rooms
here
harland
broke
off
suddenly
i
boring
you
he
said
i
really
have
no
business
to
inflict
the
recollections
of
my
youth
upon
you
brayle
brown
eyes
showed
a
glistening
animal
interest
pray
go
on
he
urged
it
sounds
like
the
chapter
of
a
romance
i
not
a
believer
in
romance
said
harland
grimly
facts
are
enough
in
themselves
without
any
embroidered
additions
this
fellow
was
a
fact
a
healthy
strong
energetic
living
fact
he
stopped
me
in
the
quadrangle
as
i
tell
you
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
shrank
from
his
touch
and
had
a
restless
desire
to
get
away
from
him
the
matter
with
you
harland
he
said
in
a
grave
musical
voice
that
was
peculiarly
his
own
seem
afraid
of
me
if
you
are
the
fault
is
in
yourself
not
in
me
i
shuffled
my
feet
about
on
the
stone
pavement
not
knowing
what
to
say
then
i
stammered
out
the
foolish
excuses
young
men
make
when
they
find
themselves
in
an
awkward
corner
he
listened
to
my
stammering
remarks
about
other
with
attentive
patience
then
he
took
his
hand
from
my
shoulder
with
a
quick
decisive
movement
here
harland
he
said
are
taking
up
all
the
conventions
and
traditions
with
which
our
poor
old
alma
mater
is
encrusted
and
sticking
them
over
you
like
burrs
cling
remember
it
a
pity
you
choose
this
way
of
going
starting
at
the
farther
end
where
oxford
leaves
off
and
life
begins
i
suppose
i
stared
for
he
went
on
mean
life
that
goes
forward
not
life
that
goes
backward
picking
up
the
stale
crumbs
fallen
from
centuries
that
have
finished
their
banquet
and
passed
on
there
i
wo
detain
you
we
shall
not
meet
often
but
do
forget
what
i
have
said
that
if
you
are
afraid
of
me
or
of
any
other
man
or
of
any
existing
thing
the
fault
is
in
yourself
not
in
the
persons
or
objects
you
fear
do
see
it
i
blurted
out
angrily
of
the
other
fellows
they
think
you
queer
he
laughed
the
other
fellows
he
said
with
you
in
the
same
boat
they
think
me
queer
because
they
are
queer
that
is
out
of
line
themselves
i
was
irritated
by
his
easy
indifference
and
asked
him
what
he
meant
by
of
line
you
see
a
beautiful
garden
harmoniously
planned
he
said
still
smiling
some
clumsy
fellow
comes
along
and
puts
a
crooked
pigstye
up
among
the
flower
beds
you
would
call
that
out
of
line
would
you
unsuitable
to
say
the
least
of
it
i
said
hotly
you
consider
me
and
my
friends
crooked
pigstyes
in
your
landscape
he
made
me
a
gay
half
apologetic
gesture
of
the
type
dear
boy
he
said
do
worry
the
crooked
pigstye
is
always
a
most
popular
kind
of
building
in
the
world
you
will
live
in
with
that
he
bade
me
and
went
i
was
very
angry
with
him
for
i
was
a
conceited
youth
and
thought
myself
and
my
particular
associates
the
very
cream
of
oxford
but
he
took
all
the
highest
honours
that
year
and
when
he
finally
left
the
university
he
vanished
so
to
speak
in
a
blaze
of
intellectual
glory
i
have
never
seen
him
again
and
never
heard
of
him
and
so
i
suppose
his
studies
led
him
nowhere
he
must
be
an
elderly
man
now
he
may
be
lame
blind
lunatic
or
what
is
more
probable
still
he
may
be
dead
and
i
know
why
i
think
of
him
except
that
his
theories
were
much
the
same
as
those
of
our
little
friend
again
indicating
me
by
a
nod
he
never
cared
for
agreeable
speeches
always
rather
mistrusted
social
conventions
and
believed
in
a
higher
life
after
death
or
a
lower
i
put
in
quietly
ah
yes
there
must
be
a
down
grade
of
course
if
there
is
an
up
the
two
would
be
part
of
each
other
existence
but
as
i
accept
neither
the
point
does
not
matter
i
looked
at
him
and
i
suppose
my
looks
expressed
wonder
or
pity
or
both
for
he
averted
his
glance
from
mine
you
are
something
of
a
spiritualist
i
believe
said
brayle
lifting
his
hard
eyes
from
the
scrutiny
of
the
tablecloth
and
fixing
them
upon
me
not
at
all
i
answered
at
once
and
with
emphasis
that
is
if
you
mean
by
the
term
a
credulous
person
who
believes
in
mediumistic
trickery
automatic
writing
and
the
like
that
is
sheer
nonsense
and
several
experienced
scientists
give
these
matters
considerable
attention
suggested
swinton
primly
i
smiled
science
like
everything
else
has
its
borderland
i
said
from
which
the
brain
can
easily
slip
off
into
chaos
the
most
approved
scientific
professors
are
liable
to
this
dire
end
of
their
speculations
they
forget
that
in
order
to
understand
the
infinite
they
must
first
be
sure
of
the
infinite
in
themselves
you
speak
like
an
oracle
fair
lady
said
harland
but
despite
your
sage
utterances
man
remains
as
finite
as
ever
if
he
chooses
the
finite
state
certainly
he
does
i
answered
he
is
always
what
he
elects
to
be
harland
seemed
desirous
of
continuing
the
argument
but
i
would
say
no
more
the
topic
was
too
serious
and
sacred
with
me
to
allow
it
to
be
lightly
discussed
by
persons
whose
attitude
of
mind
was
distinctly
opposed
and
antipathetic
to
all
things
beyond
the
merely
mundane
after
dinner
miss
catherine
professed
herself
to
be
suffering
from
neuralgia
and
gathering
up
her
shawls
and
wraps
asked
me
to
excuse
her
for
going
to
bed
early
i
bade
her
and
leaving
my
host
and
the
two
other
men
to
their
smoke
i
went
up
on
deck
we
were
anchored
off
mull
and
against
a
starlit
sky
of
exceptional
clearness
the
dark
mountains
of
morven
were
outlined
with
a
softness
as
of
black
velvet
the
yacht
rested
on
perfectly
calm
waters
shining
like
polished
steel
and
the
warm
stillness
of
the
summer
night
was
deliciously
soothing
and
restful
our
captain
and
one
or
two
of
the
sailors
were
about
on
duty
and
i
sat
in
the
stern
of
the
vessel
looking
up
into
the
glorious
heavens
the
tapering
of
the
pointed
aloft
as
it
were
into
a
woven
web
of
stars
and
i
lost
myself
in
imaginary
flight
among
those
glittering
unknown
worlds
oblivious
of
my
material
surroundings
and
forgetting
that
despite
the
splendid
evidences
of
a
governing
intelligence
in
the
beauty
and
order
of
the
universe
spread
about
them
every
day
my
companions
in
the
journey
of
pleasure
we
were
undertaking
together
were
actually
destitute
of
all
faith
in
god
and
had
less
perception
of
the
existing
divine
than
the
humblest
plant
may
possess
that
instinctively
forces
its
way
upward
to
the
light
i
did
not
think
of
this
it
was
no
use
thinking
about
it
as
i
could
not
better
the
position
but
i
found
myself
curiously
considering
the
story
harland
had
told
about
his
college
friend
at
oxford
i
tried
to
picture
his
face
and
figure
till
presently
it
seemed
as
if
i
saw
him
indeed
i
could
have
sworn
that
a
man
shadowy
form
stood
immediately
in
front
of
me
bending
upon
me
a
searching
glance
from
eyes
that
were
strangely
familiar
startled
at
this
wraith
of
my
own
fancy
i
half
rose
from
my
chair
then
sank
back
again
with
a
laugh
at
my
imagination
too
vivid
power
of
portrayal
a
figure
did
certainly
present
itself
but
one
of
sufficient
bulk
to
convince
me
of
its
substantiality
this
was
the
captain
of
the
a
personage
of
a
thoroughly
nautical
type
who
approaching
me
lifted
his
cap
and
said
that
a
wonderfully
fine
yacht
that
has
just
dropped
anchor
behind
us
she
illuminated
too
have
you
seen
her
no
i
answered
and
turned
in
the
direction
he
indicated
an
involuntary
exclamation
escaped
me
there
about
half
a
mile
to
our
rear
floated
a
schooner
of
exquisite
proportions
and
grace
outlined
from
stem
to
stern
by
delicate
borderings
of
electric
light
as
though
decorated
for
some
great
festival
and
making
quite
a
glittering
spectacle
in
the
darkness
of
the
deepening
night
we
could
see
active
figures
at
work
on
deck
the
sails
were
dropped
and
quickly
furled
but
the
quivering
radiance
remained
running
up
every
tapering
mast
and
spar
so
that
the
whole
vessel
seemed
drawn
on
the
dusky
air
with
pencil
points
of
fire
i
stood
up
gazing
at
the
wonderful
sight
in
silent
amazement
and
admiration
with
the
captain
beside
me
and
it
was
he
who
first
spoke
i
ca
make
her
out
he
said
perplexedly
we
never
heard
a
sound
except
just
when
she
dropped
anchor
and
that
was
almost
noiseless
how
she
came
round
the
point
yonder
so
suddenly
is
a
mystery
i
was
keeping
a
sharp
too
surely
she
very
large
for
a
sailing
vessel
i
queried
the
largest
i
ever
seen
he
replied
but
how
did
she
sail
that
what
i
want
to
know
he
looked
so
puzzled
that
i
laughed
well
i
suppose
in
the
usual
way
i
said
with
sails
ay
that
all
very
well
and
he
glanced
at
me
with
a
compassionate
air
as
at
one
who
knew
nothing
about
seafaring
but
sails
must
have
wind
and
there
has
been
a
capful
all
the
afternoon
or
evening
yet
she
came
in
with
crowded
canvas
full
out
as
if
there
was
a
regular
and
found
her
anchorage
as
easy
as
you
please
all
in
a
minute
too
if
there
was
a
wind
it
was
a
wind
belonging
to
this
world
would
harland
perhaps
like
to
see
her
i
took
the
hint
and
ran
down
into
the
saloon
which
by
this
time
was
full
of
the
stifling
odours
of
smoke
and
whisky
harland
was
there
drinking
and
talking
somewhat
excitedly
with
brayle
while
his
secretary
listened
and
looked
on
i
explained
why
i
had
ventured
to
interrupt
their
conversation
and
they
accompanied
me
up
on
deck
the
strange
yacht
looked
more
bewilderingly
brilliant
than
ever
the
heavens
having
somewhat
clouded
over
and
as
we
all
the
captain
included
leaned
over
our
own
deck
rail
and
gazed
at
her
shining
outlines
we
heard
the
sound
of
delicious
music
and
singing
floating
across
the
quiet
sea
some
millionaire
toy
said
harland
she
floating
from
the
mysterious
yacht
it
was
a
music
full
of
haunting
sweetness
and
rhythmic
melody
and
i
was
not
sure
whether
it
was
evolved
from
stringed
instruments
or
singing
voices
by
climbing
up
on
the
sofa
in
my
i
could
look
out
through
the
on
the
near
sea
rippling
close
to
me
and
bringing
as
i
fancied
with
every
ripple
a
new
cadence
a
tenderer
snatch
of
tune
a
subtle
scent
was
on
the
salt
air
as
of
roses
mingling
with
the
freshness
of
the
scarcely
moving
waters
it
came
i
thought
from
the
beautiful
blossoms
which
so
lavishly
adorned
my
rooms
i
could
not
see
the
yacht
from
my
point
of
observation
but
i
could
hear
the
music
she
had
on
board
and
that
was
enough
for
immediate
delight
leaving
the
open
i
lay
down
on
the
sofa
immediately
beneath
it
and
comprised
myself
to
listen
the
soft
breath
of
the
sea
blew
on
my
cheeks
and
with
every
breath
the
delicate
vibrations
of
appealing
harmony
rose
and
fell
it
was
as
if
these
enchanting
sounds
were
being
played
or
sung
for
me
alone
in
a
delicious
languor
i
drowsed
as
it
were
with
my
eyes
open
losing
myself
in
a
labyrinth
of
happy
dreams
and
fancies
which
came
to
me
unbidden
till
presently
the
music
died
softly
away
like
a
retreating
wave
and
ceased
altogether
i
waited
a
few
minutes
listening
breathlessly
lest
it
should
begin
again
and
i
lose
some
note
of
it
then
hearing
no
more
i
softly
closed
the
and
drew
the
curtain
i
did
this
with
an
odd
reluctance
feeling
somehow
that
i
had
shut
out
a
friend
and
i
half
apologised
to
this
vague
sentiment
by
reminding
myself
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
it
was
nearly
midnight
i
had
intended
writing
to
francesca
but
i
was
now
disinclined
for
anything
but
rest
the
music
which
had
so
entranced
me
throbbed
still
in
my
ears
and
made
my
heart
beat
with
a
quick
sense
of
joy
there
may
be
several
inoffensive
reasons
for
his
lighting
up
and
he
may
think
no
more
of
advertisement
than
you
or
i
that
true
assented
brayle
with
a
quick
concession
to
his
patron
humour
but
people
nowadays
do
so
many
queer
things
for
mere
notoriety
sake
that
it
is
barely
possible
to
avoid
suspecting
them
they
will
even
kill
themselves
in
order
to
be
talked
about
fortunately
they
do
hear
what
said
of
them
returned
harland
or
they
might
alter
their
minds
and
remain
alive
it
hardly
worth
while
to
hang
yourself
in
order
to
be
called
a
fool
while
this
talk
went
on
i
remained
silent
watching
the
illuminated
schooner
with
absorbed
fascination
suddenly
while
i
still
gazed
upon
her
every
spark
with
which
she
was
as
it
were
bejewelled
went
out
and
only
the
ordinary
lamps
common
to
the
watches
of
the
night
on
board
a
vessel
at
anchorage
burned
dimly
here
and
there
like
red
winking
eyes
for
the
rest
she
was
barely
visible
save
by
an
indistinct
tracery
of
blurred
black
lines
the
swiftness
with
which
her
brilliancy
had
been
eclipsed
startled
us
all
and
drew
from
captain
derrick
the
remark
that
it
was
queer
what
pantomimists
call
a
change
said
harland
with
a
laugh
the
show
is
over
for
let
us
turn
in
morning
we
try
and
make
acquaintance
with
the
stranger
and
find
out
for
captain
derrick
comfort
how
she
managed
to
sail
without
wind
we
bade
each
other
then
and
descended
to
our
several
quarters
when
i
found
myself
alone
in
the
luxurious
allotted
to
me
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
open
one
of
the
and
listen
to
the
music
which
still
came
superbly
built
sailing
vessels
are
always
more
elegant
than
steam
though
not
half
so
useful
i
expect
she
lie
becalmed
here
for
a
day
or
two
it
a
wonder
she
got
round
here
at
all
said
the
captain
there
was
any
wind
to
bring
her
harland
looked
amused
there
must
have
been
some
wind
derrick
he
answered
only
it
was
boisterous
enough
for
a
hardy
salt
like
you
to
feel
it
there
was
a
breath
declared
derrick
firmly
not
enough
to
blow
a
baby
curl
then
how
did
she
get
here
asked
brayle
captain
derrick
lifted
eyebrows
expressed
his
inability
to
solve
the
enigma
i
said
just
now
if
there
was
a
wind
it
was
a
wind
belonging
to
this
world
harland
turned
upon
him
quickly
well
there
are
no
winds
belonging
to
other
worlds
that
will
ever
disturb
our
atmosphere
he
said
come
come
derrick
you
think
that
yacht
is
a
ghost
do
you
a
sort
of
spectre
captain
derrick
smiled
broadly
no
sir
i
do
there
flesh
and
blood
aboard
i
seen
the
men
hauling
down
canvas
and
i
know
that
but
the
way
she
sailed
in
bothers
me
all
that
electric
light
is
rather
ostentatious
said
brayle
i
suppose
the
owner
wants
to
advertise
his
riches
that
does
follow
said
harland
with
some
sharpness
i
grant
you
we
live
in
an
advertising
age
but
i
do
fancy
the
owner
of
that
vessel
is
a
pill
or
a
plaster
or
even
a
special
tea
he
may
want
to
amuse
himself
it
may
be
the
birthday
of
his
wife
or
one
of
his
and
a
warm
atmosphere
of
peace
and
comfort
came
over
me
when
at
last
i
lay
down
in
my
luxurious
bed
and
slipped
away
into
the
land
of
sleep
ah
what
a
land
it
is
that
magic
land
of
sleep
a
land
with
wings
where
amid
many
shifting
and
shimmering
wonders
of
darkness
and
light
the
palace
of
vision
stands
uplifted
stately
and
beautiful
with
golden
doors
set
open
to
the
wanderer
i
made
my
entrance
there
that
night
often
and
often
as
i
had
been
within
its
enchanted
precincts
before
there
were
a
million
halls
of
marvel
as
yet
unvisited
and
among
these
i
found
myself
under
a
dome
which
seemed
of
purest
crystal
lit
with
fire
listening
to
one
invisible
who
speaking
as
from
a
great
height
discoursed
to
me
of
love
iii
the
angel
of
a
dream
the
voice
that
spoke
to
me
was
silvery
clear
and
fell
as
it
were
through
the
air
dividing
space
with
sweetness
it
was
soft
and
resonant
and
the
thrill
of
tenderness
within
it
was
as
though
an
angel
sang
through
tears
never
had
i
heard
anything
so
divinely
pure
and
compassionate
and
all
my
being
strove
to
lift
itself
towards
that
supernal
height
which
seemed
to
be
the
hidden
source
of
its
melodious
utterance
o
soul
wandering
in
the
region
of
sleep
and
dreams
said
the
voice
what
is
all
thy
searching
and
labour
worth
without
love
why
art
thou
lost
in
a
silence
without
song
i
raised
my
eyes
seeking
for
the
one
who
thus
spoke
to
me
but
could
see
nothing
in
life
great
choral
symphony
the
voice
continued
the
keynote
of
the
dominant
melody
is
love
without
the
keynote
there
can
be
no
music
there
is
dumbness
where
there
should
be
sound
there
is
discord
where
there
should
be
harmony
love
the
one
vibrant
tone
to
which
the
whole
universe
moves
in
tune
love
the
breath
of
god
the
pulsation
of
his
being
the
glory
of
his
work
the
fulfilment
of
his
eternal
joy
love
and
love
alone
is
the
web
and
texture
and
garment
of
happy
immortality
o
soul
that
seekest
the
way
to
wisdom
and
to
power
what
dost
thou
make
of
love
i
trembled
and
stood
mute
it
seemed
that
i
was
surrounded
by
solemn
presences
whose
nearness
i
could
feel
but
not
see
and
unknowing
who
it
was
that
spoke
to
me
i
was
afraid
to
answer
far
in
the
past
thousands
of
ages
ago
went
on
the
voice
the
world
we
call
the
sorrowful
star
was
a
perfect
note
in
a
perfect
scale
it
was
in
tune
with
the
divine
symphony
but
with
the
sweep
of
centuries
it
has
lagged
behind
it
has
fallen
from
light
into
shadow
and
rather
than
rise
to
light
again
it
has
made
of
itself
a
discord
opposed
to
the
eternal
harmony
it
has
chosen
for
its
keynote
hate
not
love
each
nation
envies
or
despises
the
other
each
man
struggles
against
his
and
grudges
his
neighbour
every
small
advantage
and
more
than
all
each
creed
curses
the
other
blasphemously
calling
upon
god
to
verify
and
fulfil
the
curse
hate
not
love
this
is
the
false
note
struck
by
the
pitiful
swinging
out
of
all
concordance
with
spherical
sweetness
hate
that
prefers
falsehood
to
truth
malice
to
kindness
selfishness
to
generosity
o
sorrowful
star
doomed
so
soon
to
perish
turn
turn
even
in
thy
last
moments
back
to
the
divine
ascendant
before
it
is
too
late
i
listened
and
a
sense
of
hopeless
fear
possessed
me
i
tried
to
speak
and
a
faint
whisper
crept
from
my
lips
why
i
murmured
to
myself
for
i
did
not
suppose
anyone
could
or
would
hear
me
why
should
we
and
our
world
perish
we
knew
so
little
at
the
beginning
and
we
know
so
little
now
is
it
altogether
our
fault
if
we
have
lost
our
way
a
silence
followed
a
vague
impalpable
sense
of
restraint
and
captivity
seemed
closing
me
in
on
every
side
i
was
imprisoned
as
i
thought
within
invisible
walls
then
all
at
once
this
density
of
atmosphere
was
struck
asunder
by
a
dazzling
light
as
of
cloven
wings
but
i
could
see
no
actual
shape
or
even
suggestion
of
substance
the
glowing
rays
were
all
and
the
voice
spoke
again
with
grave
sweetness
and
something
of
reproach
who
speaks
of
losing
the
way
it
asked
when
the
way
is
and
has
ever
been
clear
and
plain
nature
teaches
it
law
and
order
support
it
obey
and
ye
shall
live
disobey
and
ye
shall
die
there
is
no
other
ruling
than
this
out
of
chaos
who
is
it
that
speaks
of
losing
the
way
when
the
way
is
and
has
been
and
ever
shall
be
clear
and
plain
i
stretched
out
my
hands
involuntarily
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
o
angel
invisible
i
prayed
forgive
my
weakness
and
unwisdom
how
can
the
world
be
saved
or
comforted
by
a
love
it
never
finds
again
a
silence
again
that
dazzling
quivering
radiance
flashing
as
in
an
atmosphere
of
powdered
gold
what
does
the
world
seek
most
ardently
it
demanded
the
love
of
god
or
the
love
of
self
if
it
seeks
the
first
all
things
in
heaven
and
earth
shall
be
added
to
its
desire
if
the
second
all
shall
be
taken
from
it
even
that
which
it
hath
i
had
as
i
thought
no
answer
to
give
but
i
covered
my
weeping
eyes
with
both
hands
and
knelt
before
the
unseen
speaker
as
to
some
great
spirit
enthroned
love
is
not
love
that
loves
itself
went
on
the
voice
self
is
the
image
not
the
god
wouldst
thou
have
eternal
life
then
find
the
secret
in
eternal
love
which
can
move
worlds
and
create
universes
the
love
of
soul
for
soul
angel
for
angel
god
for
god
i
raised
my
head
and
uncovering
my
eyes
looked
up
but
i
could
see
nothing
save
that
light
which
imprisoned
me
as
it
were
in
a
circle
of
fire
love
is
that
power
which
clasps
the
things
of
eternity
and
makes
them
all
its
own
said
the
voice
in
stronger
tones
of
deeper
music
it
builds
its
solar
system
its
stars
its
planets
with
a
thought
it
wakes
all
beauty
all
delight
with
a
smile
it
lives
not
only
now
but
for
ever
in
a
heaven
of
pure
joy
where
every
thousand
years
is
but
one
summer
day
to
love
there
is
no
time
no
space
no
age
no
death
what
it
gives
it
receives
again
what
it
longs
for
comes
to
it
without
seeking
god
withholds
nothing
from
the
faithful
soul
i
still
knelt
wondering
if
these
words
were
intended
only
for
me
or
for
some
other
listener
for
i
could
not
now
feel
sure
that
i
was
without
a
companion
in
this
strange
experience
there
is
only
one
way
of
life
went
on
the
voice
only
one
way
the
way
of
love
whosoever
loves
greatly
lives
greatly
whosoever
misprizes
love
is
dead
though
living
give
all
thy
heart
and
soul
to
love
if
thou
wouldst
be
immortal
for
without
love
thou
mayst
seek
god
through
all
eternity
and
never
find
him
i
waited
there
was
a
brief
silence
then
a
sudden
wave
of
music
broke
upon
my
ears
a
breaking
foam
of
rhythmic
melody
that
rose
and
fell
in
a
measured
cadence
of
solemn
sound
raising
my
eyes
in
fear
and
awe
i
saw
the
lambent
light
around
me
begin
to
separate
into
countless
gradations
of
delicate
colour
till
presently
it
resembled
a
close
and
brilliant
network
of
rainbow
tints
intermingled
with
purest
gold
it
was
as
if
millions
of
lines
had
been
drawn
with
exquisite
fineness
and
precision
so
as
to
cause
intersection
or
meeting
at
given
points
of
calculation
and
these
changed
into
various
dazzling
forms
too
brilliant
for
even
my
dreaming
sight
to
follow
yet
i
felt
myself
compelled
to
study
one
particular
section
of
these
lines
which
shone
before
me
in
a
kind
of
pale
brightness
and
while
i
looked
it
varied
to
more
and
more
complex
of
colour
and
light
if
one
might
so
express
it
till
by
gradual
degrees
it
returned
again
to
the
simpler
combination
thus
are
the
destinies
of
human
lives
woven
and
interwoven
said
the
voice
from
infinite
and
endless
points
of
light
they
grow
and
part
and
mingle
together
till
the
destined
two
are
one
often
they
are
entangled
and
disturbed
by
influences
not
their
own
but
from
interference
which
through
weakness
or
fear
they
have
themselves
permitted
but
the
tangle
is
for
ever
unravelled
by
time
the
parted
threads
are
brought
together
again
in
the
eternal
weaving
of
spirit
and
matter
no
power
human
or
divine
can
entirely
separate
the
lives
which
god
has
ordained
shall
come
together
man
ordainment
is
not
god
ordainment
wrong
threads
in
the
weaving
are
broken
no
matter
how
no
matter
when
love
must
be
tender
yet
resolved
love
must
not
swerve
from
its
given
pledge
love
must
be
all
or
nothing
the
light
network
of
living
golden
rays
still
quivered
before
my
eyes
till
all
at
once
they
seemed
to
change
to
a
rippling
sea
of
fine
flame
with
waves
that
gently
swayed
to
and
fro
tipped
with
of
prismatic
hue
like
broken
rainbows
wave
after
wave
swept
forward
and
broke
in
bright
amethystine
spray
close
to
me
where
i
knelt
and
as
i
watched
this
moving
mass
of
radiant
colour
in
absorbed
fascination
one
wave
brilliant
as
the
flush
of
a
summer
dawn
rippled
towards
me
and
then
gently
retiring
left
a
single
rose
crimson
and
fragrant
close
within
my
reach
i
stooped
and
caught
it
quickly
surely
it
was
a
real
rose
from
some
dewy
garden
of
the
earth
and
no
dream
one
rose
from
all
the
roses
in
heaven
said
the
mystic
voice
in
tones
of
enthralling
sweetness
one
fadeless
and
immortal
only
one
but
sufficient
for
all
one
love
from
all
the
million
loves
of
men
and
women
one
but
enough
for
eternity
how
long
the
rose
has
awaited
its
flowering
how
long
the
love
has
awaited
its
fulfilment
only
the
recording
angels
know
such
roses
bloom
but
once
in
the
wilderness
of
space
and
time
such
love
comes
but
once
in
a
universe
of
worlds
i
listened
trembling
i
held
the
rose
against
my
breast
between
my
clasped
hands
o
sorrowful
star
went
on
the
voice
what
shall
become
of
thee
if
thou
forsakest
the
way
of
love
o
little
sphere
of
beauty
and
delight
why
are
thy
people
so
blind
o
that
their
eyes
were
lifted
unto
heaven
their
hearts
to
joy
their
souls
to
love
who
is
it
that
darkens
life
with
sorrow
who
is
it
that
creates
the
delusion
of
death
i
found
my
speech
suddenly
nay
surely
i
said
half
whispering
we
must
all
die
not
so
and
the
mystic
voice
rang
out
imperatively
there
is
no
death
for
god
is
alive
and
from
him
life
only
can
emanate
i
held
my
peace
moved
by
a
sudden
sweet
awe
from
eternal
life
no
death
can
come
continued
the
voice
from
eternal
love
flows
eternal
joy
change
there
is
change
there
must
be
to
higher
forms
and
higher
planes
but
life
and
love
remain
as
they
are
indestructible
same
yesterday
and
for
ever
i
bent
my
face
over
the
rose
against
my
breast
its
perfume
was
deliciously
soft
and
penetrating
and
half
unconsciously
i
kissed
its
velvet
petals
as
i
did
this
a
swift
and
dazzling
radiance
poured
through
the
air
and
again
i
heard
mysterious
chords
of
rhythmic
melody
rising
and
falling
like
distant
waves
of
the
sea
the
grave
tender
voice
spoke
once
again
rise
and
go
hence
it
said
in
tones
of
thrilling
gentleness
keep
the
gift
god
sends
thee
take
that
which
is
thine
meet
that
which
hath
sought
thee
sorrowing
for
many
centuries
turn
not
aside
again
neither
by
thine
own
will
nor
by
the
will
of
others
lest
old
errors
prevail
pass
from
vision
into
waking
from
night
to
day
from
seeming
death
to
life
from
loneliness
to
love
and
keep
within
thy
heart
the
message
of
a
dream
the
light
beating
about
me
like
curved
wings
slowly
paled
and
as
slowly
vanished
yet
i
felt
that
i
must
still
kneel
and
wait
this
atmosphere
of
awe
and
trembling
gradually
passed
away
and
then
rising
as
i
thought
and
holding
the
mystic
rose
with
one
hand
still
against
my
breast
i
turned
to
feel
my
way
through
the
darkness
which
now
encompassed
me
as
i
did
this
my
other
hand
was
caught
by
someone
in
a
warm
eager
clasp
and
i
was
guided
along
with
an
infinitely
tender
yet
masterful
touch
which
i
had
no
hesitation
in
obeying
step
by
step
i
moved
with
a
strange
sense
of
happy
reliance
on
my
unseen
companion
darkness
or
distance
had
no
terrors
for
me
and
as
i
went
onward
with
my
hand
held
firmly
in
that
close
yet
gentle
grasp
my
thoughts
became
as
it
were
suddenly
cleared
into
a
heaven
of
comprehension
i
looked
back
upon
years
of
work
spread
out
like
an
arid
desert
uncheered
by
any
spring
of
sweet
water
and
i
saw
all
that
my
life
had
lacked
all
to
which
i
had
unconsciously
pressed
forward
longingly
without
any
distinct
recognition
of
my
own
aims
and
only
trusting
to
the
infinite
powers
of
god
and
nature
to
amend
my
incompleteness
by
the
perfection
of
the
everlasting
whole
and
now
had
the
answer
come
at
any
rate
i
felt
i
was
no
longer
alone
someone
who
seemed
the
natural
other
half
of
myself
was
beside
me
in
the
shadows
of
sleep
i
could
have
spoken
but
would
not
for
fear
of
breaking
the
charm
and
so
i
went
on
and
on
caring
little
how
long
the
journey
might
be
and
even
vaguely
wishing
it
might
continue
for
ever
when
presently
a
faint
light
began
to
peer
through
the
gloom
i
saw
a
glimmer
of
blue
and
grey
then
white
then
and
i
awoke
to
find
nothing
of
a
visionary
character
about
me
unless
perhaps
a
shaft
of
early
morning
sunshine
streaming
through
the
of
my
cabin
could
be
called
a
reflex
of
the
mystic
glory
which
had
surrounded
me
in
sleep
i
then
remembered
where
i
was
yet
i
was
so
convinced
of
the
reality
of
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
that
i
looked
about
me
everywhere
for
that
lovely
crimson
rose
i
had
brought
away
with
me
from
dreamland
for
i
could
actually
feel
its
stem
still
between
my
fingers
it
was
not
to
be
seen
but
there
was
delicate
fragrance
on
the
air
as
if
it
were
blooming
near
me
a
fragrance
so
fine
that
nothing
could
describe
its
subtly
pervading
odour
every
word
spoken
by
the
voice
of
my
dream
was
vividly
impressed
on
my
brain
and
more
vivid
still
was
the
recollection
of
the
hand
that
had
clasped
mine
and
led
me
out
of
sleep
to
waking
i
was
conscious
of
its
warmth
yet
and
i
was
troubled
even
while
i
was
soothed
by
the
memory
of
the
lingering
caress
with
which
it
had
been
at
last
withdrawn
and
i
wondered
as
i
lay
for
a
few
moments
in
my
bed
inert
and
thinking
of
all
that
had
chanced
to
me
in
the
night
whether
the
long
earnest
patience
of
my
soul
ever
turned
as
it
had
been
for
years
towards
the
attainment
of
a
love
higher
than
all
earthly
attraction
was
now
about
to
be
recompensed
i
knew
and
had
always
known
that
whatsoever
we
strongly
will
to
possess
comes
to
us
in
due
season
and
that
steadily
resolved
prayers
are
always
granted
the
only
drawback
to
the
exertion
of
this
power
is
the
doubt
as
to
whether
the
thing
we
desire
so
ardently
will
work
us
good
or
for
there
is
no
question
but
that
what
we
seek
we
shall
find
i
had
sought
long
and
unwearyingly
for
the
clue
to
the
secret
of
life
imperishable
and
love
eternal
was
the
mystery
about
to
be
unveiled
i
could
not
tell
and
i
dare
not
humour
the
mere
thought
too
long
shaking
my
mind
free
from
the
web
of
marvel
and
perplexity
in
which
it
had
been
caught
by
the
visions
of
the
night
i
placed
myself
in
a
passively
receptive
attitude
demanding
nothing
fearing
nothing
hoping
nothing
but
simply
content
with
actual
life
feeling
life
to
be
the
outcome
and
expression
of
perfect
love
iv
a
bunch
of
heather
it
was
a
glorious
morning
and
so
warm
that
i
went
up
on
deck
without
any
hat
or
cloak
glad
to
have
the
sunlight
playing
on
my
hair
and
the
soft
breeze
blowing
on
my
face
the
scene
was
perfectly
enchanting
the
mountains
were
bathed
in
a
delicate
glow
reflected
from
the
past
pomp
of
the
sun
rising
the
water
was
still
as
an
inland
lake
and
every
mast
and
spar
of
the
was
reflected
in
it
as
in
a
mirror
a
flock
of
floated
round
our
vessel
like
fairy
boats
some
of
them
rising
every
now
and
then
with
eager
cries
to
wing
their
graceful
flight
high
through
the
calm
air
and
alight
again
with
a
flash
of
silver
pinions
on
the
translucent
blue
while
i
stood
gazing
in
absorbed
delight
at
the
beauty
which
everywhere
surrounded
me
captain
derrick
called
to
me
from
his
little
bridge
where
he
stood
with
folded
arms
looking
down
good
morning
what
do
you
think
of
the
mystery
now
mystery
and
then
his
meaning
flashed
upon
me
oh
the
yacht
that
anchored
near
us
last
night
where
is
she
just
so
and
the
captain
look
expressed
volumes
where
is
she
oddly
enough
i
had
not
thought
of
the
stranger
vessel
till
this
moment
though
the
music
sounding
from
her
deck
had
been
the
last
thing
which
had
haunted
my
ears
before
i
had
slept
and
dreamed
and
now
she
was
gone
there
was
not
a
sign
of
her
anywhere
i
looked
up
at
the
captain
on
his
bridge
and
smiled
she
must
have
started
very
early
i
said
the
captain
fuzzy
brows
met
portentously
ay
very
early
so
early
that
the
watch
never
saw
her
go
he
must
have
missed
an
hour
and
she
must
have
gained
one
it
rather
strange
is
it
i
said
may
i
come
on
the
bridge
certainly
i
ran
up
the
little
steps
and
stood
beside
him
looking
out
to
the
farthest
line
of
sea
and
sky
what
do
you
think
about
it
i
asked
laughingly
was
she
a
real
yacht
or
a
ghost
the
captain
did
not
smile
his
brow
was
furrowed
with
perplexed
consideration
she
was
a
ghost
he
said
but
her
ways
were
ghostly
that
is
she
made
no
noise
and
she
sailed
without
wind
harland
may
say
what
he
likes
i
stick
to
that
she
had
no
steam
but
she
carried
full
sail
and
she
came
into
the
sound
with
all
her
canvas
bellying
out
as
though
she
were
driven
by
a
stormy
there
been
no
wind
all
night
yet
she
gone
as
you
see
and
not
a
man
on
board
heard
the
weighing
of
her
anchor
when
she
went
and
how
she
went
beats
me
altogether
at
that
moment
we
caught
sight
of
a
small
rowing
boat
coming
out
to
us
from
the
shore
pulled
by
one
man
who
bent
to
his
oars
in
a
slow
listless
way
as
though
disinclined
for
the
labour
boat
ahoy
shouted
the
captain
the
man
looked
up
and
signalled
in
answer
a
couple
of
our
sailors
went
to
throw
him
a
rope
as
he
brought
his
craft
alongside
he
had
come
so
he
slowly
explained
in
his
soft
slow
almost
unintelligible
highland
dialect
with
fresh
eggs
and
butter
hoping
to
effect
a
sale
the
steward
was
summoned
and
bargaining
began
i
listened
and
looked
on
amused
and
interested
and
i
presently
suggested
to
the
captain
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
ask
this
man
if
he
too
had
seen
the
yacht
whose
movements
appeared
so
baffling
and
inexplicable
the
captain
at
once
took
the
hint
say
donald
he
began
invitingly
did
you
see
the
big
yacht
that
came
in
last
night
about
ten
ou
ay
was
the
slow
answer
but
my
name
no
tonald
it
just
jamie
captain
derrick
laughed
jovially
beg
pardon
jamie
then
did
you
see
the
yacht
ou
ay
i
seen
her
mony
a
day
she
a
real
shentleman
i
smiled
the
yacht
jamie
looked
up
at
me
ah
my
leddy
ye
pe
makin
a
fule
o
jamie
wi
a
glance
like
a
on
the
sea
jamie

the
right
sort
an
the
yacht

a
shentleman
an
the
shentleman
the
yacht
for
it
the
shentleman
that
pays
whateffer
captain
derrick
became
keenly
interested
the
gentleman
the
owner
of
the
yacht
you
mean
jamie
nodded
just
that
and
proceeded
to
count
out
his
store
of
eggs
with
great
care
as
he
placed
them
in
the
steward
basket
what
his
name
ah
that
ower
mickle
learnin
said
jamie
with
a
cunning
look
i
canna
say
it
rightly
can
you
say
it
wrongly
i
suggested
i
wadna
he
replied
and
he
lifted
his
eyes
which
were
dark
and
piercing
to
my
face
i
daurna
is
he
such
a
very
terrible
gentleman
then
enquired
captain
derrick
jocosely
jamie
countenance
was
impenetrable
ye
pe
seein
her
for
yourself
whateffer
he
said
ye
no
miss
her
in
the
waters
here
an
skye
he
stooped
and
fumbled
in
his
basket
presently
bringing
out
of
it
a
small
bunch
of
pink
the
delicate
waxen
type
of
blossom
which
is
found
only
in
mossy
marshy
places
the
shentleman
wanted
as
much
as
i
could
find
o
this
he
said
he
had
it
a
but
this
wee
bittie
will
my
leddy
wear
it
for
luck
i
took
it
from
his
hand
as
a
gift
i
asked
smiling
i
wadna
tak
ony
money
he
answered
with
a
curious
expression
of
something
like
fear
passing
over
his
brown
features
is
fairies
making
i
put
the
little
bunch
in
my
dress
as
i
did
so
he
doffed
his
cap
good
day
i
be
no
seein
ye
this
way
again
why
not
how
do
you
know
one
way
in
and
another
way
out
he
said
his
voice
sinking
to
a
sort
of
meditative
croon
one
road
to
the
west
and
the
other
to
the
east
and
round
about
to
the
ou
ay
ye
mak
it
clear
sailin
without
wind
eh
interposed
captain
derrick
like
your
friend
the
how
does
he
manage
that
business
jamie
looked
round
with
a
frightened
air
like
an
animal
scenting
danger
then
shouldering
his
empty
basket
he
gave
us
a
hasty
nod
of
farewell
and
scrambling
down
the
companion
ladder
without
another
word
was
soon
in
his
boat
again
rowing
away
steadily
and
never
once
looking
back
a
wild
chap
said
the
captain
many
of
these
fellows
get
half
daft
living
so
much
alone
in
desolate
places
like
mull
and
seeing
nothing
all
their
time
but
cloud
and
mountain
and
sea
he
seems
to
know
something
about
that
yacht
though
that
yacht
is
on
your
brain
captain
i
said
merrily
i
feel
quite
sorry
for
you
and
yet
i
daresay
if
we
meet
her
again
the
mystery
will
turn
out
to
be
very
simple
it
will
have
to
be
either
very
simple
or
very
complex
he
answered
with
a
laugh
i
shall
need
a
good
deal
of
teaching
to
show
me
how
a
sailing
yacht
can
make
steam
speed
without
wind
ah
good
morning
sir
and
we
both
turned
to
greet
harland
who
had
just
come
up
on
deck
he
looked
ill
and
careworn
as
though
he
had
slept
badly
and
he
showed
but
faint
interest
in
the
tale
of
the
strange
yacht
sudden
exit
it
amuses
you
does
it
he
said
addressing
me
with
a
little
cynical
smile
wrinkling
up
his
forehead
and
eyes
anything
that
can
not
be
at
once
explained
is
always
interesting
and
delightful
to
a
woman
that
is
why
spiritualistic
make
money
they
do
clever
tricks
which
can
not
be
explained
hence
their
success
with
the
credulous
quite
so
i
replied
but
just
allow
me
to
say
that
i
am
no
believer
in
true
i
forgot
he
rubbed
his
hand
wearily
over
his
brows
then
asked
did
you
sleep
well
splendidly
and
i
must
really
thank
you
for
my
lovely
rooms
they
are
almost
too
luxurious
they
are
fit
for
a
princess
why
a
princess
he
queried
ironically
princesses
are
not
always
agreeable
personages
i
know
one
or
two
fat
ugly
and
stupid
some
of
them
are
dirty
in
their
persons
and
in
their
habits
there
are
certain
in
europe
who
ought
to
be
washed
and
disinfected
before
being
given
any
rooms
anywhere
i
laughed
oh
you
are
very
bitter
i
said
not
at
all
i
like
accuracy
to
the
ingenuous
mind
suggests
a
fairy
tale
i
have
not
an
ingenuous
mind
i
know
that
the
princesses
of
the
fairy
tales
do
not
exist
unless
you
are
one
me
i
exclaimed
in
amazement
i
very
far
from
that
well
you
are
a
dreamer
he
said
and
resting
his
arms
on
the
deck
rail
he
looked
away
from
me
down
into
the
sunlit
sea
you
do
not
live
here
in
this
world
with
us
you
think
you
do
and
yet
in
your
own
mind
you
know
you
do
not
you
dream
and
your
life
is
that
of
vision
simply
i
not
sure
that
i
should
like
to
see
you
wake
for
as
long
as
you
can
dream
you
will
believe
in
the
fairy
tale
the
of
hans
andersen
and
the
brothers
grimm
holds
good
and
that
is
why
you
should
have
pretty
things
about
you
music
roses
and
the
like
trifles
to
keep
up
the
delicate
delusion
i
was
surprised
and
just
a
little
vexed
at
his
way
of
talking
why
even
with
the
underlying
flattery
of
his
words
should
he
call
me
a
dreamer
i
had
worked
for
my
own
living
as
practically
as
himself
in
the
world
and
if
not
with
such
financially
successful
results
only
because
my
aims
had
never
been
mere
he
had
attained
enormous
wealth
i
a
modest
competence
he
was
old
and
i
was
young
he
was
ill
and
miserable
i
was
well
and
happy
which
of
us
was
the
my
thoughts
were
busy
with
this
question
and
he
saw
it
do
perplex
yourself
he
said
and
do
be
offended
with
me
for
my
frankness
my
view
of
life
is
not
yours
nor
are
we
ever
likely
to
see
things
from
the
same
standpoint
yours
is
the
more
enviable
condition
you
are
looking
well
you
feel
well
you
are
well
health
is
the
best
of
all
things
he
paused
and
lifting
his
eyes
from
the
contemplation
of
the
water
regarded
me
fixedly
that
a
lovely
bit
of
you
wearing
it
glows
like
fiery
topaz
i
explained
how
it
had
been
given
to
me
why
then
you
already
established
a
connection
with
the
strange
yacht
he
said
laughing
the
owner
according
to
your
highland
fellow
has
the
same
blossoms
on
board
probably
gathered
from
the
same
morass
surely
this
is
quite
romantic
and
exciting
and
at
breakfast
when
brayle
and
swinton
appeared
they
all
made
conversation
on
the
subject
of
my
bunch
of
heather
till
i
got
rather
tired
of
it
and
was
half
inclined
to
take
it
off
and
throw
it
away
yet
somehow
i
could
not
do
this
glancing
at
my
own
reflection
in
a
mirror
i
saw
what
a
brilliant
yet
dainty
touch
of
colour
it
gave
to
the
plain
white
serge
of
my
yachting
dress
it
was
a
pretty
contrast
and
i
left
it
alone
miss
catherine
did
not
get
up
to
breakfast
but
she
sent
for
me
afterwards
and
asked
if
i
would
mind
sitting
with
her
for
a
while
i
did
mind
in
a
way
for
the
day
was
fair
and
fine
the
was
preparing
to
pursue
her
course
and
it
was
far
pleasanter
to
be
on
deck
in
the
fresh
air
than
in
miss
catherine
which
though
quite
spacious
for
a
yacht
accommodation
looked
rather
dreary
having
no
carpet
on
the
floor
no
curtains
to
the
bed
and
no
little
graces
of
adornment
anywhere
nothing
but
a
few
shelves
against
the
wall
on
which
were
ranged
some
blue
and
black
medicine
bottles
relieved
by
a
small
array
of
but
i
felt
sorry
for
the
poor
woman
who
had
elected
to
make
her
life
a
martyrdom
to
nerves
and
real
or
imaginary
aches
and
pains
so
i
went
to
her
determined
to
do
what
i
could
to
cheer
and
rouse
her
from
her
condition
of
chronic
depression
directly
i
entered
her
cabin
she
said
where
did
you
get
that
bright
bit
of
heather
i
told
her
the
whole
story
to
which
she
listened
with
more
patience
than
she
usually
showed
for
any
talk
in
which
she
had
not
first
share
it
really
quite
interesting
she
said
with
a
reluctant
smile
i
suppose
it
was
the
strange
yacht
that
had
the
music
on
board
last
night
it
kept
me
awake
i
thought
it
was
some
tiresome
person
out
in
a
boat
with
a
gramophone
i
laughed
oh
miss
harland
i
exclaimed
surely
you
could
not
have
thought
it
a
gramophone
such
music
it
was
perfectly
exquisite
was
it
and
she
drew
the
ugly
grey
woollen
shawl
in
which
she
was
wrapped
closer
about
her
sallow
throat
as
she
sat
up
in
her
bed
and
looked
at
me
well
it
may
have
been
to
you
you
seem
to
find
delight
in
everything
i
sure
i
do
know
why
of
course
it
very
nice
to
have
such
a
happy
disposition
but
really
that
music
teased
me
dreadfully
such
a
bore
having
music
when
you
want
to
go
to
sleep
i
was
silent
and
having
a
piece
of
embroidery
to
occupy
my
hands
i
began
to
work
at
it
i
hope
you
quite
comfortable
on
board
she
resumed
presently
have
you
all
you
want
in
your
rooms
i
assured
her
that
everything
was
perfect
she
sighed
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
she
said
i
really
hate
yachting
but
father
likes
it
so
i
must
sacrifice
myself
here
she
sighed
again
i
saw
she
was
really
convinced
that
she
was
immolating
herself
on
the
altar
of
filial
obedience
you
know
he
is
very
ill
she
went
on
and
that
he
can
not
live
long
he
told
me
something
about
it
i
answered
and
i
said
then
as
i
say
now
that
the
doctors
may
be
wrong
oh
no
they
can
not
be
wrong
in
his
case
she
declared
shaking
her
head
dismally
they
know
the
symptoms
and
they
can
only
avert
the
end
for
a
time
i
very
thankful
brayle
was
able
to
come
with
us
on
this
trip
i
suppose
he
is
paid
a
good
deal
for
his
services
i
said
eight
hundred
guineas
she
answered
but
you
see
he
has
to
leave
his
patients
in
london
and
find
another
man
to
attend
to
them
during
his
absence
he
is
so
very
clever
and
so
much
sought
after
i
know
what
i
should
do
without
him
i
sure
has
he
any
special
treatment
for
you
i
asked
oh
yes
he
gives
me
electricity
he
has
a
wonderful
battery
he
has
got
it
fitted
up
here
in
the
next
cabin
and
while
i
hold
two
handles
he
turns
it
on
and
it
runs
all
over
me
i
feel
always
better
for
the
moment
but
the
effect
soon
passes
i
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
i
should
think
so
dear
miss
harland
do
you
really
believe
in
that
way
of
administering
electricity
of
course
i
do
she
answered
you
see
it
all
a
question
of
what
they
call
bacteriology
nowadays
medicine
is
no
use
unless
it
can
kill
the
microbes
that
are
eating
us
up
inside
and
out
and
there
scarcely
any
drug
that
can
do
that
electricity
is
the
only
remedy
it
gives
the
little
brutes
a
shock
and
the
poor
lady
laughed
weakly
and
it
kills
some
but
not
all
it
a
dreadful
scheme
of
creation
do
you
think
to
make
human
beings
no
better
than
happy
hunting
grounds
for
invisible
creatures
to
feed
upon
it
depends
on
what
view
you
take
of
it
i
said
laying
down
my
work
and
trying
to
fix
her
attention
a
matter
which
was
always
difficult
we
human
beings
are
composed
of
good
and
evil
particles
if
the
good
are
encouraged
they
drive
out
the
evil
if
the
evil
they
drive
out
the
good
it
the
same
with
the
body
as
the
soul
if
we
encourage
the
as
you
call
them
they
will
drive
out
disease
from
the
human
organism
altogether
she
sank
back
on
her
pillow
wearily
we
ca
do
it
she
said
all
the
chances
are
against
us
the
use
of
our
trying
to
encourage
microbes
the
ones
have
got
the
upper
hand
just
think
our
parents
grandparents
and
are
to
blame
for
half
our
evils
their
diseases
become
ours
in
various
new
forms
it
cruel
horrible
how
anyone
can
believe
that
a
god
of
love
created
such
a
frightful
scheme
passes
my
comprehension
the
whole
thing
is
a
mere
business
of
eating
to
be
eaten
she
looked
so
wan
and
wild
that
i
pitied
her
greatly
surely
that
is
not
what
you
think
at
the
bottom
of
your
heart
i
said
gently
i
should
be
very
sorry
for
you
if
i
thought
you
really
meant
what
you
say
well
you
may
be
as
sorry
for
me
as
you
like
and
the
poor
lady
blinked
away
tears
from
her
eyes
i
need
someone
to
be
sorry
for
me
i
tell
you
my
life
is
a
perfect
torture
every
day
i
wonder
how
long
i
can
bear
it
i
have
such
dreadful
thoughts
i
picture
the
horrible
things
that
are
happening
to
different
people
all
over
the
world
nobody
helping
them
or
caring
for
them
and
i
almost
feel
as
if
i
must
scream
for
mercy
it
would
be
any
use
screaming
but
the
scream
is
in
my
soul
all
the
same
people
in
prisons
people
in
shipwrecks
people
dying
by
inches
in
hospitals
no
good
in
their
lives
and
no
hope
and
not
a
sign
of
comfort
from
the
god
whom
the
churches
praise
it
awful
i
do
see
how
anybody
can
do
anything
or
be
ambitious
for
anything
it
all
mere
waste
of
energy
one
of
the
reasons
that
made
me
so
anxious
to
have
you
come
on
this
trip
with
us
is
that
you
always
seem
contented
and
happy
and
i
want
to
know
why
it
a
question
of
temperament
i
suppose
but
do
tell
me
why
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
touched
mine
appealingly
i
took
her
worn
and
wasted
fingers
in
my
own
and
pressed
them
sympathetically
my
dear
miss
harland
i
began
oh
call
me
catherine
she
interrupted
i
so
tired
of
being
miss
harland
well
catherine
then
i
said
smiling
a
little
surely
you
know
why
i
am
contented
and
happy
no
i
do
not
she
said
with
quick
almost
querulous
eagerness
i
do
understand
it
at
all
you
have
none
of
the
things
that
please
women
you
do
seem
to
care
about
dress
though
you
are
always
you
do
go
to
balls
or
theatres
or
you
are
a
general
favourite
yet
you
avoid
society
you
never
troubled
yourself
to
take
your
chances
of
marriage
and
so
far
as
i
know
or
have
heard
tell
about
you
you
have
even
a
lover
my
cheeks
grew
suddenly
warm
a
curious
resentment
awoke
in
me
at
her
words
had
i
indeed
no
lover
surely
i
had
one
that
i
knew
well
and
had
known
for
a
long
time
one
for
whom
i
had
guarded
my
life
sacredly
as
belonging
to
another
as
well
as
to
myself
a
lover
who
loved
me
beyond
all
power
of
human
expression
here
the
rush
of
strange
and
inexplicable
emotion
in
me
was
hurled
back
on
my
mind
with
a
shock
of
mingled
terror
and
surprise
from
a
dead
wall
of
stony
fact
it
was
true
of
course
and
catherine
harland
was
right
i
had
no
lover
no
man
had
ever
loved
me
well
enough
to
be
called
by
such
a
name
the
flush
cooled
off
my
face
the
hurry
of
my
thoughts
slackened
i
took
up
my
embroidery
and
began
to
work
at
it
again
that
is
so
is
it
persisted
miss
harland
though
you
blush
and
grow
pale
as
if
there
was
someone
in
the
background
i
met
her
inquisitive
glance
and
smiled
there
is
no
one
i
said
there
never
has
been
anyone
i
paused
i
could
almost
feel
the
warmth
of
the
strong
hand
that
had
held
mine
in
my
dream
of
the
past
night
it
was
mere
fancy
and
i
went
on
i
should
not
care
for
what
modern
men
and
women
call
love
it
seems
very
unsatisfactory
she
sighed
it
is
frequently
very
selfish
she
said
i
want
to
tell
you
my
may
i
why
of
course
i
answered
a
little
wonderingly
for
i
had
not
thought
she
had
a
to
tell
it
very
brief
she
said
and
her
lip
quivered
there
was
a
man
who
used
to
visit
our
house
very
often
when
i
first
came
out
he
made
me
believe
he
was
very
fond
of
me
i
was
more
than
fond
of
him
i
almost
worshipped
him
he
was
all
the
world
to
me
and
though
father
did
not
like
him
very
much
he
wished
me
to
be
happy
so
we
were
engaged
that
was
the
time
of
my
life
the
only
time
i
ever
knew
what
happiness
was
one
evening
just
about
three
months
before
we
were
to
be
married
we
were
together
at
a
party
in
the
house
of
one
of
our
mutual
friends
and
i
heard
him
talking
rather
loudly
in
a
room
where
he
and
two
or
three
other
men
had
gone
to
smoke
he
said
something
that
made
me
stand
still
and
wonder
whether
i
was
mad
or
dreaming
me
when
i
married
to
catherine
harland
pity
him
i
listened
i
knew
it
was
wrong
to
listen
but
i
could
not
help
myself
you
get
enough
cash
with
her
to
set
you
all
right
in
the
world
anyhow
said
another
man
can
put
up
with
a
plain
wife
for
the
sake
of
a
pretty
fortune
then
he
my
love
spoke
again
i
shall
make
the
best
of
it
he
said
must
have
money
somehow
and
this
is
the
easiest
way
there
one
good
thing
about
modern
life
husbands
and
wives
do
hunt
in
couples
as
they
used
to
do
so
when
once
the
knot
is
tied
i
shall
shift
my
matrimonial
burden
off
my
shoulders
as
much
as
i
can
she
amuse
herself
with
her
clothes
and
the
household
and
fond
of
me
so
i
shall
always
have
my
own
way
but
it
an
awful
martyrdom
to
have
to
marry
one
woman
on
account
of
empty
pockets
when
you
in
love
with
another
i
heard
and
then
i
do
know
what
happened
her
eyes
stared
at
me
so
pitifully
that
i
was
full
of
sorrow
for
her
oh
you
poor
catherine
i
said
and
taking
her
hand
i
kissed
it
gently
the
tears
in
her
eyes
brimmed
over
they
found
me
lying
on
the
floor
insensible
she
went
on
tremulously
and
i
was
very
ill
for
a
long
time
afterwards
people
could
not
understand
it
when
i
broke
off
my
engagement
i
told
nobody
why
except
him
he
seemed
sorry
and
a
little
ashamed
but
i
think
he
was
more
vexed
at
losing
my
fortune
than
anything
else
i
said
to
him
that
i
had
never
thought
about
being
plain
that
the
idea
of
his
loving
me
had
made
me
feel
beautiful
that
was
true
my
dear
i
almost
believe
i
should
have
grown
into
beauty
if
i
had
been
sure
of
his
love
i
understood
that
she
was
perfectly
right
in
what
to
the
entirely
commonplace
person
would
seem
a
fanciful
theory
love
makes
all
things
fair
and
anyone
who
is
conscious
of
being
tenderly
loved
grows
lovely
as
a
rose
that
is
conscious
of
the
sun
grows
into
form
and
colour
well
it
was
all
over
then
she
ended
with
a
sigh
i
never
was
quite
myself
again
i
think
my
nerves
got
a
sort
of
shock
such
as
the
great
novelist
charles
dickens
had
when
he
was
in
the
railway
accident
you
remember
the
tale
in
forster
how
the
carriage
hung
over
the
edge
of
an
embankment
but
did
not
actually
fall
and
dickens
was
clinging
on
to
it
all
the
time
he
never
got
over
it
and
it
was
the
remote
cause
of
his
death
five
years
later
now
i
have
felt
just
like
that
my
life
has
hung
over
a
sort
of
chasm
ever
since
i
lost
my
love
and
i
only
cling
on
but
surely
i
ventured
to
say
surely
there
are
other
things
to
live
for
than
just
the
memory
of
one
man
love
which
was
not
love
at
all
you
seem
to
think
there
was
some
cruelty
or
unhappiness
in
the
chance
that
separated
you
from
him
but
really
it
was
a
special
mercy
and
favour
of
god
only
you
have
taken
it
in
the
wrong
way
i
have
taken
it
in
the
only
possible
way
she
said
with
resignation
oh
do
you
call
it
resignation
i
exclaimed
to
make
a
misery
of
what
should
have
been
a
gladness
think
of
the
years
and
years
of
wretchedness
you
might
have
passed
with
a
man
who
was
a
merely
selfish
you
would
have
had
to
see
him
grow
colder
and
more
callous
every
day
your
heart
would
have
been
torn
your
spirit
broken
and
god
spared
you
all
this
by
giving
you
your
chance
of
freedom
such
a
chance
you
might
have
made
much
of
it
if
you
had
only
chosen
she
looked
at
me
but
did
not
speak
love
comes
to
us
in
a
million
beautiful
ways
i
went
on
heedless
of
how
she
might
take
my
words
the
ordinary
love
or
i
would
say
the
ordinary
mating
and
marriage
is
only
one
way
you
can
not
live
in
the
world
without
being
loved
if
you
love
she
moved
on
her
pillows
restlessly
i
ca
see
what
you
mean
she
said
how
can
i
love
i
have
nothing
to
love
but
do
you
not
see
that
you
are
shutting
yourself
out
from
love
i
said
you
will
not
have
it
you
bar
its
approach
you
encourage
your
sad
and
morbid
fancies
and
think
of
illness
when
you
might
just
as
well
think
of
health
oh
i
know
you
will
say
i
am
in
the
air
as
your
father
expresses
it
but
it
true
all
the
same
that
if
you
love
everything
in
nature
yes
everything
sunshine
air
cloud
rain
trees
birds
blossom
they
will
love
you
in
return
and
give
you
some
of
their
life
and
strength
and
beauty
she
smiled
a
very
bitter
little
smile
you
talk
like
a
poet
she
said
and
of
all
things
in
the
world
i
hate
poetry
there
do
think
me
cross
go
along
and
be
happy
in
your
own
strange
fanciful
way
i
can
not
be
other
than
i
am
brayle
will
tell
you
that
i
not
strong
enough
to
share
in
other
lives
and
aims
and
pleasures
i
must
always
consider
myself
brayle
tells
you
that
i
queried
to
consider
yourself
of
course
he
does
if
i
had
not
considered
myself
every
hour
and
every
day
i
should
have
been
dead
long
ago
i
have
to
consider
everything
i
eat
and
drink
lest
it
should
make
me
i
rose
from
my
seat
beside
her
i
wish
i
could
cure
you
i
murmured
my
dear
girl
if
you
could
you
would
i
am
sure
she
answered
you
are
very
it
has
done
me
good
to
talk
to
you
and
tell
you
all
my
sad
little
history
i
shall
get
up
presently
and
have
my
electricity
and
feel
quite
bright
for
a
time
but
as
for
a
cure
you
might
as
well
try
to
cure
my
father
none
are
cured
of
any
ailment
unless
they
resolve
to
help
along
the
cure
themselves
i
said
she
gave
a
weary
little
laugh
ah
that
one
of
your
pet
theories
but
it
no
use
to
me
i
past
all
helping
of
myself
so
you
may
give
me
up
as
a
bad
job
but
you
asked
me
i
went
on
did
you
not
to
tell
you
why
it
is
that
i
am
contented
and
happy
do
you
really
want
to
know
a
vague
distrust
crept
into
her
faded
eyes
not
if
it
a
theory
she
said
i
should
not
have
the
brain
or
the
patience
to
think
it
out
i
laughed
it
not
a
theory
it
a
truth
i
answered
but
truth
is
sometimes
more
difficult
than
theory
she
looked
at
me
half
in
wonder
half
in
appeal
well
what
is
it
just
this
and
i
knelt
beside
her
for
a
moment
holding
her
hand
i
know
that
there
are
no
external
surroundings
which
we
do
not
make
for
ourselves
and
that
our
troubles
are
born
of
our
own
wrong
thinking
and
are
not
sent
from
god
i
train
my
soul
to
be
calm
and
my
body
obeys
my
soul
that
all
her
fingers
closed
on
mine
nervously
but
what
the
use
of
telling
me
this
she
half
whispered
i
believe
in
god
or
the
soul
i
rose
from
my
kneeling
attitude
poor
catherine
i
said
then
indeed
it
is
no
use
telling
you
anything
you
are
in
darkness
instead
of
daylight
and
no
one
can
make
you
see
oh
what
can
i
do
to
help
you
nothing
she
answered
my
faith
it
was
never
very
much
was
taken
from
me
altogether
when
i
was
quite
young
father
made
it
seem
absurd
he
a
clever
man
you
know
and
in
a
few
words
he
makes
out
religion
to
be
utter
nonsense
i
understand
and
indeed
i
did
entirely
understand
her
father
was
one
of
a
rapidly
increasing
class
of
men
who
are
a
danger
to
the
community
a
cold
cynical
shatterer
of
every
noble
ideal
a
sneerer
at
patriotism
and
honour
a
deliberate
iconoclast
of
the
most
callous
and
remorseless
type
that
he
had
good
points
in
his
character
was
not
to
be
denied
a
murderer
may
have
these
but
to
be
in
his
company
for
very
long
was
to
feel
that
there
is
no
good
in
anything
that
life
is
a
mistake
of
nature
and
death
a
fortunate
ending
of
the
blunder
that
god
is
a
delusion
and
the
a
mere
expression
signifying
certain
intelligent
movements
of
the
brain
only
i
stood
silently
thinking
these
things
while
she
watched
me
rather
wistfully
presently
she
said
are
you
going
on
deck
now
yes
i
join
you
all
at
luncheon
do
lose
that
bit
of
heather
in
your
dress
it
really
quite
brilliant
like
a
jewel
i
hesitated
a
moment
you
not
vexed
with
me
for
speaking
as
i
have
done
i
asked
her
vexed
no
indeed
i
love
to
hear
you
and
see
you
defending
your
own
fairy
ground
for
it
is
like
a
fairy
tale
you
know
all
that
you
believe
it
has
practical
results
anyway
i
answered
you
must
admit
that
yes
i
know
and
it
just
what
i
ca
understand
we
have
another
talk
about
it
some
day
would
you
tell
brayle
that
i
shall
be
ready
for
him
in
ten
minutes
i
assented
and
left
her
i
made
for
the
deck
directly
the
air
meeting
me
with
a
rush
of
salty
softness
as
i
ran
up
the
saloon
stairway
what
a
glorious
day
it
was
sky
sea
and
mountains
were
bathed
in
brilliant
sunshine
the
was
cutting
her
path
swiftly
through
waters
which
marked
her
course
on
either
side
by
a
streak
of
white
foam
i
mentally
contrasted
the
loveliness
of
the
scene
around
me
with
the
stuffy
cabin
i
had
just
left
and
seeing
brayle
smoking
comfortably
in
a
long
reclining
chair
and
reading
a
paper
i
went
up
to
him
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
your
patient
wants
you
in
ten
minutes
i
said
he
rose
to
his
feet
at
once
courteously
offering
me
a
chair
which
i
declined
and
drew
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
i
have
two
patients
on
board
he
answered
smiling
which
one
the
one
who
is
your
patient
from
choice
not
necessity
i
replied
coolly
my
dear
lady
his
eyes
blinked
at
me
with
a
furtive
astonishment
if
you
were
not
so
charming
i
should
say
you
were
well
shall
i
say
it
a
trifle
opinionated
i
laughed
granted
i
said
if
it
is
opinionated
to
be
honest
i
plead
guilty
miss
harland
is
as
well
as
you
or
i
she
only
morbid
true
but
morbidness
is
a
form
of
illness
a
malady
of
the
nerves
i
laughed
again
much
to
his
visible
annoyance
curable
by
outward
applications
of
electricity
i
queried
when
the
mischief
is
in
the
mind
but
there
i
must
interfere
i
suppose
nevertheless
you
keep
miss
harland
ill
when
she
might
be
quite
well
a
disagreeable
line
furrowed
the
corners
of
his
mouth
you
think
so
among
your
many
accomplishments
do
you
count
the
art
of
medicine
i
met
his
shifty
brown
eyes
and
he
dropped
them
quickly
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
answered
except
this
that
the
cure
of
any
mind
trouble
must
come
from
within
not
from
without
and
i
not
a
christian
scientist
either
he
smiled
cynically
really
not
i
should
have
thought
you
were
you
would
make
a
grave
error
if
you
thought
so
i
responded
curtly
a
keen
and
watchful
interest
flashed
over
his
dark
face
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
your
theories
are
he
said
suddenly
you
interest
me
greatly
i
sure
i
do
i
answered
smiling
he
looked
me
up
and
down
for
a
moment
in
perplexity
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
are
a
strange
creature
he
said
i
can
not
make
you
out
if
i
were
asked
to
give
a
opinion
of
you
i
should
say
you
were
very
neurotic
and
and
given
over
to
thanks
and
i
made
him
a
demure
little
curtsy
i
look
it
do
i
no
you
do
look
it
but
looks
are
deceptive
there
i
agree
with
you
i
said
but
one
has
to
go
by
them
sometimes
if
i
am
my
looks
do
not
pity
me
and
my
condition
of
health
leaves
nothing
to
desire
his
brows
met
in
a
slight
frown
he
glanced
at
his
watch
i
must
go
he
said
miss
harland
will
be
waiting
and
the
electricity
will
get
cold
i
added
gaily
see
if
you
can
feel
my
pulse
he
took
the
hand
i
extended
and
remained
quite
still
conscious
of
the
secret
force
i
had
within
myself
i
resolved
to
try
if
i
could
use
it
upon
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
keep
him
a
prisoner
till
i
chose
to
let
him
go
i
watched
him
till
his
eyes
began
to
look
vague
and
a
kind
of
fixity
settled
on
his
features
he
was
perfectly
unconscious
that
i
held
him
at
my
pleasure
and
presently
satisfied
with
my
experiment
i
relaxed
the
spell
and
withdrew
my
hand
quite
regular
is
it
i
said
carelessly
he
started
as
if
roused
from
a
sleep
but
replied
quickly
yes
oh
yes
perfectly
i
had
almost
forgotten
what
i
was
doing
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
miss
harland
yes
miss
harland
is
ready
for
you
by
this
time
and
i
smiled
you
must
tell
her
i
detained
you
he
nodded
in
a
more
or
less
embarrassed
manner
and
turning
away
from
me
went
rather
slowly
down
the
saloon
stairs
i
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
was
gone
i
had
from
the
first
moment
of
our
meeting
recognised
in
him
a
mental
organisation
which
in
its
godless
materialism
and
indifference
to
consequences
was
opposed
to
every
healthful
influence
that
might
be
brought
to
bear
on
his
patients
for
their
whatever
his
pretensions
to
medical
skill
might
be
it
was
to
his
advantage
to
show
them
the
worst
side
of
a
disease
in
order
to
accentuate
his
own
cleverness
in
dealing
with
it
it
served
his
purpose
to
pamper
their
darkest
imaginings
play
with
their
whims
and
humour
their
caprices
i
saw
all
this
and
understood
it
and
i
was
glad
that
so
far
as
i
might
be
concerned
i
had
the
power
to
master
him
v
an
unexpected
meeting
to
spend
a
few
days
on
board
a
yacht
with
the
same
companions
is
a
very
good
test
of
the
value
of
sympathetic
vibration
in
human
associations
i
found
it
so
i
might
as
well
have
been
quite
alone
on
the
as
with
morton
harland
and
his
daughter
though
they
were
always
uniformly
kind
to
me
and
thoughtful
of
my
comfort
but
between
us
there
was
great
gulf
fixed
though
every
now
and
again
catherine
harland
made
feeble
and
pathetic
efforts
to
cross
that
gulf
and
reach
me
where
i
stood
on
the
other
side
but
her
strength
was
not
equal
to
the
task
her
was
sapped
at
its
root
and
every
day
she
allowed
herself
to
become
more
and
more
pliantly
the
prey
of
brayle
who
with
a
subconscious
feeling
that
i
knew
him
to
be
a
mere
medical
charlatan
had
naturally
warned
her
against
me
as
an
imaginative
theorist
without
any
foundation
of
belief
in
my
own
theories
i
therefore
shut
myself
within
a
fortress
of
reserve
and
declined
to
discuss
any
point
of
either
religion
or
science
with
those
for
whom
the
one
was
a
farce
and
the
other
mere
materialism
at
all
times
when
we
were
together
i
kept
the
conversation
deliberately
down
to
commonplaces
which
were
safe
if
dull
and
it
amused
me
not
a
little
to
see
that
at
this
course
of
action
on
my
part
harland
was
first
surprised
then
disappointed
and
finally
bored
and
i
was
glad
that
i
should
bore
him
as
much
as
he
bored
me
was
the
happy
consummation
of
my
immediate
desires
i
talked
as
all
conventional
women
talk
of
the
weather
of
our
minimum
and
maximum
speed
of
the
newspaper
and
vulgarities
that
were
served
up
to
us
whenever
we
called
at
a
port
for
the
mails
of
the
fish
that
frequented
such
and
such
waters
of
sport
of
this
and
that
millionaire
whose
highland
castle
or
was
crammed
with
the
whose
delight
is
to
kill
innocent
birds
and
animals
of
the
latest
in
aeroplanes
in
short
no
fashionable
jabberer
of
social
inanities
could
have
beaten
me
in
what
average
persons
call
talk
talk
which
resulted
after
a
while
in
the
usual
vagueness
of
attention
accompanied
by
smothered
yawning
i
was
resolved
not
to
lift
the
line
of
thought
in
the
in
the
manner
whereof
i
had
often
been
accused
but
to
keep
it
level
with
the
ground
so
that
when
we
left
tobermory
where
we
had
anchored
for
a
couple
of
days
the
limits
of
the
yacht
were
becoming
rather
cramped
and
narrow
for
our
differing
minds
and
a
monotony
was
beginning
to
set
in
that
threatened
to
be
dangerous
if
not
unbearable
as
the
steamed
along
through
the
drowsy
misty
light
of
the
summer
afternoon
past
the
jagged
coast
of
the
mainland
i
sat
quite
by
myself
on
deck
watching
the
creeping
purple
haze
that
partially
veiled
the
mountains
of
ardnamurchan
and
moidart
and
i
began
to
wonder
whether
after
all
it
might
not
be
better
to
write
to
my
friend
francesca
and
tell
her
that
her
prophecies
had
already
come
true
that
i
was
beginning
to
be
weary
of
a
holiday
passed
in
an
atmosphere
bereft
of
all
joyousness
and
that
she
must
expect
me
in
at
once
and
yet
i
was
reluctant
to
end
my
trip
with
the
harlands
too
soon
there
was
a
secret
wish
in
my
heart
which
i
hardly
breathed
to
myself
a
wish
that
i
might
again
see
the
strange
vessel
that
had
appeared
and
disappeared
so
suddenly
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
its
owner
it
would
surely
be
an
interesting
break
in
the
present
condition
of
things
to
say
the
least
of
it
i
did
not
know
then
though
i
know
now
why
my
mind
so
persistently
busied
itself
with
the
fancied
personality
of
the
unknown
possessor
of
the
mysterious
craft
which
as
captain
derrick
said
without
wind
but
i
found
myself
always
thinking
about
him
and
trying
to
picture
his
face
and
form
i
took
myself
sharply
to
task
for
what
i
considered
a
foolish
mental
attitude
but
do
what
i
would
the
attitude
remained
unchanged
it
was
helped
perhaps
in
a
trifling
way
by
the
apparently
fadeless
quality
of
the
pink
which
had
been
given
me
by
the
highland
fellow
who
called
himself
jamie
for
though
three
or
four
days
had
now
passed
since
i
first
wore
it
it
showed
no
signs
of
withering
as
a
rule
the
delicate
waxen
bells
of
this
plant
turn
yellow
a
few
hours
after
they
are
plucked
but
my
little
bunch
was
as
brilliantly
fresh
as
ever
i
kept
it
in
a
glass
without
water
on
the
table
in
my
and
it
looked
always
the
same
i
was
questioning
myself
as
to
what
i
should
really
do
if
my
surroundings
remained
as
hopelessly
inert
and
uninteresting
as
they
were
at
present
go
on
with
the
for
a
while
longer
on
the
chance
of
seeing
the
strange
yacht
again
or
make
up
my
mind
to
get
put
out
at
some
point
from
which
i
could
reach
inverness
easily
when
harland
came
up
suddenly
behind
my
chair
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
are
you
in
dreamland
he
enquired
and
i
thought
his
voice
sounded
rather
weak
and
dispirited
there
a
wonderful
light
on
those
hills
just
now
i
raised
my
eyes
and
saw
the
purple
shadows
being
cloven
and
scattered
one
after
another
by
long
rays
of
late
sunshine
that
poured
like
golden
wine
through
the
dividing
wreaths
of
vapour
above
the
sky
was
pure
turquoise
blue
melting
into
pale
opal
and
emerald
near
the
line
of
the
grey
sea
which
showed
little
flecks
of
white
foam
under
the
freshening
breeze
bringing
my
gaze
down
from
the
dazzling
radiance
of
the
heavens
i
turned
towards
harland
and
was
startled
and
shocked
to
see
the
drawn
and
livid
pallor
of
his
face
and
the
anguish
of
his
expression
you
are
ill
i
exclaimed
and
springing
up
in
haste
i
offered
him
my
chair
do
sit
down
he
made
a
mute
gesture
of
denial
and
with
slow
difficulty
drew
another
chair
up
beside
mine
and
dropped
into
it
with
an
air
of
heavy
weariness
i
am
not
ill
now
he
said
a
little
while
ago
i
was
very
ill
i
was
in
pain
horrible
pain
brayle
did
what
he
could
for
me
it
was
not
much
he
says
i
must
expect
to
suffer
now
and
again
until
until
the
end
impulsively
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
i
am
very
sorry
i
said
gently
i
wish
i
could
be
of
some
use
to
you
he
looked
at
me
with
a
curious
wistfulness
you
could
no
doubt
if
i
believed
as
you
do
he
replied
and
then
was
silent
for
a
moment
presently
he
spoke
again
do
you
know
i
am
rather
disappointed
in
you
are
you
and
i
smiled
a
little
why
he
did
not
answer
at
once
he
seemed
absorbed
in
troubled
musings
when
he
resumed
it
was
in
a
low
meditative
tone
almost
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
himself
when
i
first
met
you
you
remember
at
one
of
those
social
which
make
the
london
season
so
infinitely
tedious
i
was
told
you
were
gifted
with
unusual
psychic
power
and
that
you
had
in
yourself
the
secret
of
an
abounding
exhaustless
vitality
i
repeat
the
words
an
abounding
exhaustless
vitality
this
interested
me
because
i
know
that
our
modern
men
and
women
are
mostly
only
half
alive
i
heard
of
you
that
it
did
people
good
to
be
in
your
company
that
your
influence
upon
them
was
remarkable
and
that
there
was
some
unknown
form
of
occult
or
psychic
science
to
which
you
had
devoted
years
of
study
with
the
result
that
you
stood
as
it
were
apart
from
the
world
though
in
the
world
this
i
say
is
what
i
heard
but
you
did
not
believe
it
i
interposed
why
do
you
say
that
he
asked
quickly
because
i
know
you
could
not
believe
it
i
answered
it
would
be
impossible
for
you
a
gleam
of
satire
flashed
in
his
sunken
eyes
well
you
are
right
there
i
did
not
believe
it
but
i
expected
i
know
and
i
laughed
you
expected
what
is
called
a
woman
one
who
makes
herself
adopts
a
pose
and
is
altogether
removed
from
ordinary
humanity
and
of
course
you
are
disappointed
i
am
not
at
all
a
type
of
the
veiled
priestess
it
is
not
that
he
said
with
a
little
vexation
when
i
saw
you
i
recognised
you
to
be
a
very
transparent
creature
devoted
to
innocent
dreams
which
are
not
life
but
that
secret
which
you
are
reported
to
possess
the
secret
of
wonderful
abounding
exhaustless
vitality
how
does
it
happen
that
you
have
it
i
myself
see
that
force
expressed
in
your
very
glance
and
gesture
and
what
puzzles
me
is
that
it
is
not
an
animal
vitality
it
is
something
else
i
was
silent
you
have
not
a
robust
physique
he
went
on
yet
you
are
more
full
of
the
spirit
of
life
than
men
and
women
twice
as
strong
as
you
are
you
are
a
feminine
thing
too
and
that
goes
against
you
but
one
can
see
in
you
a
worker
you
evidently
enjoy
the
exercise
of
the
accomplishments
you
possess
and
nothing
comes
amiss
to
you
i
wonder
how
you
manage
it
when
you
joined
us
on
this
trip
a
few
days
ago
you
brought
a
kind
of
atmosphere
with
you
that
was
almost
buoyant
and
now
i
am
disappointed
because
you
seem
to
have
enclosed
yourself
within
it
and
to
have
left
us
out
have
you
not
left
yourselves
out
i
queried
gently
i
personally
have
really
nothing
to
do
with
it
just
remember
that
when
we
have
talked
on
any
subject
above
the
line
of
the
general
and
commonplace
your
sole
object
has
been
to
me
for
the
amusement
of
yourself
and
brayle
ah
you
saw
that
did
you
he
interrupted
with
a
faint
smile
naturally
had
you
believed
half
you
say
you
were
told
of
me
you
would
have
known
i
must
have
seen
it
can
you
wonder
that
i
refuse
to
be
he
looked
at
me
with
an
odd
expression
of
mingled
surprise
and
annoyance
and
i
met
his
gaze
fully
and
frankly
his
eyes
shifted
uneasily
away
from
mine
one
may
feel
a
pardonable
curiosity
he
said
and
a
desire
to
know
to
know
what
i
asked
with
some
warmth
how
can
you
obtain
what
you
are
secretly
craving
for
if
you
persist
in
denying
what
is
true
you
are
afraid
of
death
yet
you
invite
it
by
ignoring
the
source
of
life
the
curtain
is
down
you
are
outside
eternal
realities
altogether
in
a
chaos
of
your
own
voluntary
creation
i
spoke
with
some
passion
and
he
heard
me
patiently
let
us
try
to
understand
each
other
he
said
after
a
pause
though
it
will
be
difficult
you
speak
of
realities
to
me
there
are
none
save
the
constant
scattering
and
of
atoms
these
so
far
as
we
know
of
the
extraordinary
and
to
me
quite
unintelligent
plan
of
the
universe
are
for
ever
shifting
and
changing
into
various
forms
and
clusters
of
forms
such
as
solar
systems
planets
comets
and
the
like
our
present
view
of
them
is
chiefly
based
on
the
researches
of
larmor
and
thomson
of
cambridge
from
them
and
other
scientists
we
learn
that
electricity
exists
in
small
particles
which
we
can
in
a
manner
see
in
the
rays
and
these
particles
are
called
these
compose
of
matter
well
there
are
a
trillion
of
atoms
in
each
granule
of
dust
while
electrons
are
so
much
smaller
that
a
hundred
thousand
of
them
can
lie
in
the
diameter
of
an
atom
i
know
all
this
but
i
do
not
know
why
the
atoms
or
electrons
should
exist
at
all
nor
what
cause
there
should
be
for
their
constant
and
often
violent
state
of
movement
they
apparently
always
have
been
and
always
will
be
therefore
they
are
all
that
can
be
called
realities
sir
norman
lockyer
tells
us
that
the
matter
of
the
universe
is
undergoing
a
continuous
process
of
evolution
but
even
if
it
is
so
what
is
that
to
me
individually
it
neither
helps
nor
consoles
me
for
being
one
infinitesimal
spark
in
the
general
conflagration
now
you
believe
in
the
force
that
is
behind
your
system
of
electrons
and
atoms
i
said
for
by
whatever
means
or
substances
the
universe
is
composed
a
mighty
intelligence
governs
it
and
i
look
to
the
cause
more
than
the
effect
for
even
i
am
a
part
of
the
whole
i
belong
to
the
source
of
the
stream
as
much
as
to
the
stream
itself
an
abstract
lifeless
principle
without
will
or
intention
or
intelligence
could
not
have
evolved
the
splendours
of
nature
or
the
intellectual
capabilities
of
man
it
could
not
have
given
rise
to
what
was
not
in
itself
he
fixed
his
eyes
steadily
upon
me
that
last
sentence
is
sound
argument
he
said
as
though
reluctantly
admitting
the
obvious
and
i
suppose
i
am
to
presume
that
is
the
from
which
you
draw
or
imagine
you
draw
your
psychic
force
if
i
have
any
psychic
force
at
all
i
responded
where
do
you
suppose
it
should
come
from
but
that
which
gives
vitality
to
all
animate
nature
i
can
not
understand
why
you
blind
yourself
to
the
open
and
visible
fact
of
a
divine
intelligence
working
in
and
through
all
things
if
you
could
but
acknowledge
it
and
set
yourself
in
tune
with
it
you
would
find
life
a
new
and
far
more
dominant
joy
than
it
is
to
you
now
i
firmly
believe
that
your
very
illness
has
arisen
from
your
determined
attitude
of
unbelief
that
what
a
christian
scientist
would
say
he
answered
with
a
touch
of
scorn
i
begin
to
think
brayle
is
right
in
his
estimate
of
you
i
held
my
peace
have
you
no
curiosity
he
demanded
do
you
want
to
know
his
opinion
no
and
i
smiled
my
dear
harland
with
all
your
experience
of
the
world
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
there
are
some
people
whose
opinions
do
matter
brayle
is
a
clever
man
he
said
somewhat
testily
and
you
are
merely
an
imaginative
woman
then
why
do
you
trouble
about
me
i
asked
him
quickly
why
do
you
want
to
find
out
that
something
in
me
which
baffles
both
brayle
and
yourself
it
was
now
his
turn
to
be
silent
and
he
remained
so
for
some
time
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
shadowing
heavens
the
waves
were
roughening
slightly
and
a
swell
from
the
atlantic
lifted
the
curtsying
over
their
crests
as
she
ploughed
her
way
swiftly
along
presently
he
turned
to
me
with
a
smile
let
us
strike
a
truce
he
said
i
promise
not
to
try
and
you
any
more
but
please
do
not
isolate
yourself
from
us
try
to
feel
that
we
are
your
friends
i
want
you
to
enjoy
this
trip
if
possible
but
i
fear
that
we
are
proving
rather
dull
company
for
you
we
are
making
for
skye
at
good
speed
and
shall
probably
anchor
in
loch
scavaig
we
might
land
and
do
the
excursion
to
loch
coruisk
if
you
care
for
that
though
catherine
is
not
a
good
walker
i
felt
rather
remorseful
as
he
said
these
words
in
a
kindly
tone
yet
i
knew
very
well
that
notwithstanding
all
the
strenuous
efforts
which
might
be
made
by
the
rules
of
conventional
courtesy
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
feel
quite
at
home
in
the
surroundings
which
he
had
created
for
himself
i
inwardly
resolved
however
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
to
try
and
steer
clear
of
any
possibilities
or
incidents
which
might
tend
to
draw
the
line
of
demarcation
too
strongly
between
us
some
instinct
told
me
that
present
conditions
were
not
to
remain
as
they
were
so
i
answered
my
host
gently
and
assured
him
of
my
entire
willingness
to
fall
in
with
any
of
his
plans
our
conversation
then
gradually
drifted
into
ordinary
topics
till
towards
sunset
when
i
went
down
to
my
cabin
to
dress
for
dinner
i
had
a
fancy
to
wear
the
bunch
of
pink
that
still
kept
its
fresh
and
delicacy
of
bloom
and
this
fastened
in
the
lace
of
my
white
gown
was
my
only
adornment
that
night
there
was
a
distinct
attempt
on
everybody
part
to
make
things
sociable
and
pleasant
catherine
harland
was
for
once
quite
cheerful
and
chatty
and
proposed
that
as
there
was
a
lovely
moonlight
we
should
all
go
after
dinner
into
the
deck
saloon
where
there
was
a
piano
and
that
i
should
sing
for
them
i
was
rather
surprised
at
this
suggestion
as
she
was
not
fond
of
music
nevertheless
there
had
been
such
an
evident
wish
shown
by
her
and
her
father
to
lighten
the
monotony
which
had
been
creeping
like
a
mental
fog
over
us
all
that
i
readily
agreed
to
anything
which
might
perhaps
for
the
moment
give
them
pleasure
we
went
up
on
deck
accordingly
and
on
arriving
there
were
all
smitten
into
awed
silence
by
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
scene
we
were
anchored
in
loch
scavaig
and
the
light
of
the
moon
fell
with
a
weird
splendour
on
the
gloom
of
the
surrounding
hills
a
pale
beam
touching
the
summits
here
and
there
and
deepening
the
solemn
effect
of
the
lake
and
the
magnificent
forms
of
its
sentinel
mountains
a
low
murmur
of
hidden
streams
sounded
on
the
deep
stillness
and
enhanced
the
fascination
of
the
surrounding
landscape
which
was
more
like
the
landscape
of
a
dream
than
a
reality
the
deep
breadths
of
dense
darkness
lying
lost
among
the
cavernous
slopes
of
the
hills
were
broken
at
intervals
by
strange
rifts
of
light
arising
as
it
were
from
the
palpitating
water
which
now
and
again
showed
gleams
of
pale
emerald
and
gold
phosphorescence
the
stars
looked
large
and
white
like
straying
bits
of
the
moon
and
the
mysterious
of
slow
ripples
heaving
against
the
sides
of
the
yacht
suggested
the
whisperings
of
uncanny
spirits
we
stood
in
a
silent
group
entranced
by
the
grandeur
of
the
night
and
by
our
own
loneliness
in
the
midst
of
it
for
there
was
no
sign
of
a
fisherman
hut
or
boat
moored
to
the
shore
or
anything
which
could
give
us
a
sense
of
human
companionship
a
curious
feeling
of
disappointment
suddenly
came
over
me
i
lifted
my
eyes
to
the
vast
dark
sky
with
a
kind
of
mute
appeal
and
moon
and
stars
appeared
to
float
up
there
like
ships
in
a
deep
sea
i
had
expected
something
more
in
this
strange
almost
landscape
and
yet
i
knew
not
why
i
should
expect
anything
beautiful
as
the
whole
scene
was
and
fully
as
i
recognised
its
beauty
an
overpowering
depression
suddenly
gripped
me
as
with
a
cold
hand
there
was
a
dreary
emptiness
in
this
majestic
solitude
that
seemed
to
crush
my
spirit
utterly
i
moved
a
little
away
from
my
companions
and
leaned
over
the
deck
rail
looking
far
into
the
black
shadows
of
the
shore
defined
more
deeply
by
the
contrasting
brilliance
of
the
moon
and
my
thoughts
flew
with
undesired
swiftness
to
the
darkest
line
of
life
horizon
i
had
for
the
moment
lost
the
sense
of
joy
how
wretched
all
we
human
creatures
are
i
said
to
my
inner
self
what
hope
after
all
is
there
for
us
imprisoned
in
a
world
which
has
no
pity
for
us
whatever
may
be
our
fate
a
world
that
goes
on
in
precisely
the
same
fashion
whether
we
live
or
die
work
or
are
idle
these
tragic
hills
this
cold
lake
this
white
moon
were
the
same
when
caesar
lived
and
would
still
be
the
same
when
we
who
gazed
upon
them
now
were
all
gone
into
the
unknown
it
seemed
difficult
to
try
and
realise
this
obvious
fact
so
difficult
as
to
be
almost
unnatural
supposing
that
any
towns
or
villages
had
ever
existed
on
this
desolate
shore
they
had
proved
useless
against
the
devouring
forces
of
nature
just
as
the
splendid
buried
cities
of
south
america
had
proved
useless
in
all
their
magnificence
useless
as
the
age
of
lanka
in
ceylon
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
of
what
avail
then
is
the
struggle
of
human
life
is
it
for
the
many
or
only
for
the
few
is
all
the
toil
and
sorrow
of
millions
merely
for
the
uplifting
and
perfecting
of
certain
individual
types
and
is
this
what
christ
meant
when
he
said
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
if
so
why
such
waste
of
brain
and
heart
and
love
and
patience
tears
came
suddenly
into
my
eyes
and
i
started
as
from
a
bad
dream
when
brayle
approached
me
softly
from
behind
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
your
reverie
he
said
but
miss
harland
has
gone
into
the
deck
saloon
and
we
are
all
waiting
to
hear
you
sing
i
looked
up
at
him
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
sing
i
replied
rather
tremulously
this
lonely
landscape
depresses
me
he
saw
that
my
eyes
were
wet
and
smiled
you
are
overwrought
he
said
your
own
theories
of
health
and
vitality
are
not
infallible
you
must
be
taken
care
of
you
think
too
much
or
too
little
i
suggested
really
my
dear
lady
you
can
not
possibly
think
too
little
where
health
and
happiness
are
concerned
the
sanest
and
most
comfortable
people
on
earth
are
those
who
eat
well
and
never
think
at
all
an
empty
brain
and
a
full
stomach
make
the
sum
total
of
a
contented
life
so
you
imagine
i
said
with
a
slight
gesture
of
veiled
contempt
so
i
know
he
answered
with
emphasis
and
i
have
had
a
wide
experience
now
do
look
daggers
at
me
come
and
sing
he
offered
me
his
arm
but
i
put
it
aside
and
walked
by
myself
towards
the
deck
saloon
harland
and
catherine
were
seated
there
with
all
the
lights
turned
full
on
so
that
the
radiance
of
the
moon
through
the
window
was
completely
eclipsed
the
piano
was
open
as
i
came
in
catherine
looked
at
me
with
a
surprised
air
why
how
pale
you
are
she
exclaimed
one
would
think
you
had
seen
a
ghost
i
laughed
perhaps
i
have
loch
scavaig
is
sufficient
setting
for
any
amount
of
ghosts
it
such
a
lonely
place
and
a
slight
tremor
ran
through
me
as
i
played
a
few
soft
chords
what
shall
i
sing
to
you
something
of
the
country
we
are
in
said
harland
do
you
know
any
of
those
old
wild
gaelic
airs
i
thought
a
moment
and
then
to
a
low
rippling
accompaniment
i
sang
the
old
celtic
love
song
why
should
i
sit
and
sigh
bracken
bracken
why
should
i
sit
and
sigh
on
the
dreary
when
i
see
the
plover
rising
or
the
curlew
wheeling
then
i
know
my
mortal
lover
back
to
me
is
stealing
when
the
day
wears
away
sad
i
look
adown
the
valley
every
sound
heard
around
sets
my
heart
why
should
i
sit
and
sigh
bracken
bracken
why
should
i
sit
and
sigh
all
alone
and
weary
ah
but
there
is
something
wanting
oh
but
i
am
weary
come
my
true
and
tender
lover
the
hills
to
cheer
me
why
should
i
sit
and
sigh
bracken
bracken
why
should
i
sit
and
sigh
all
alone
and
weary
i
had
scarcely
finished
the
last
verse
when
captain
derrick
suddenly
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
saloon
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
come
out
mr
harland
he
almost
shouted
come
quickly
all
of
you
there
that
strange
yacht
again
i
rose
from
my
seat
at
the
piano
trembling
a
little
at
last
i
thought
at
last
my
heart
was
beating
tumultuously
though
i
could
not
explain
my
own
emotion
to
myself
in
another
moment
we
were
all
standing
speechless
and
amazed
gazing
at
surely
the
most
wonderful
sight
that
had
ever
been
seen
by
human
eyes
there
on
the
dark
and
lonely
waters
of
loch
scavaig
was
poised
rather
than
anchored
the
fairy
vessel
of
my
dreams
with
all
sails
spread
sails
that
were
white
as
milk
and
seemingly
drenched
with
a
sparkling
dewy
radiance
for
they
scintillated
like
in
the
sun
and
glittered
against
the
sombre
background
of
the
mountainous
shore
with
an
almost
blinding
splendour
our
whole
crew
of
sailors
and
servants
on
the
came
together
in
astonished
groups
whispering
among
themselves
all
evidently
more
or
less
scared
by
the
strange
spectacle
captain
derrick
waited
for
someone
to
hazard
a
remark
then
as
we
remained
silent
he
addressed
harland
well
sir
what
do
you
make
of
it
harland
did
not
answer
for
a
man
who
professed
indifference
to
all
events
and
circumstances
he
seemed
startled
for
once
and
a
little
afraid
catherine
caught
me
by
the
arm
she
was
shivering
nervously
do
you
think
it
is
a
real
yacht
she
whispered
i
was
amused
at
this
question
coming
as
it
did
from
a
woman
who
denied
the
supernatural
of
course
it
is
i
answered
do
you
see
people
moving
about
on
board
for
in
the
brilliant
light
shed
by
those
extraordinary
sails
the
schooner
appeared
to
be
fully
manned
several
of
the
crew
were
busy
on
her
deck
and
there
was
nothing
of
the
phantom
in
their
movements
her
sails
must
surely
be
lit
up
in
that
way
by
electricity
said
brayle
who
had
been
watching
her
attentively
but
how
it
is
done
and
why
is
rather
puzzling
i
never
saw
anything
quite
to
resemble
it
she
came
into
the
loch
like
a
flash
said
captain
derrick
i
saw
her
slide
in
round
the
point
and
then
without
a
sound
of
any
kind
there
she
was
safe
anchored
before
you
could
whistle
she
behaved
in
just
the
same
way
when
we
first
sighted
her
off
mull
i
listened
to
what
they
were
saying
impatiently
wondering
what
would
be
the
end
of
their
surmises
and
speculations
why
not
exchange
courtesies
i
said
suddenly
here
we
are
two
yachts
anchored
near
each
other
in
a
lonely
lake
why
should
we
not
know
each
other
then
all
the
mysteries
you
are
talking
about
would
be
cleared
up
quite
true
said
harland
breaking
his
silence
at
last
but
is
it
rather
late
to
pay
a
call
what
time
is
it
about
ten
answered
brayle
glancing
at
his
watch
oh
let
us
get
to
bed
murmured
miss
catherine
pleadingly
the
good
of
making
any
enquiries
well
if
you
do
make
them
ten
to
one
you
wo
have
the
chance
said
captain
derrick
bluntly
that
yacht
will
repeat
her
former
manoeuvres
and
vanish
at
sunrise
as
all
spectres
are
traditionally
supposed
to
do
said
brayle
lighting
a
cigarette
as
he
spoke
and
beginning
to
smoke
it
with
a
careless
air
i
vote
for
catching
the
ghost
before
it
melts
away
into
the
morning
while
this
talk
went
on
harland
stepped
back
into
the
saloon
and
wrote
a
note
which
he
enclosed
in
a
sealed
envelope
with
this
in
his
hand
he
came
out
to
us
again
captain
will
you
get
the
boat
lowered
please
he
said
then
as
captain
derrick
hastened
to
obey
this
order
he
turned
to
his
secretary
swinton
i
want
you
to
take
this
note
to
the
owner
of
that
yacht
whoever
he
may
be
with
my
compliments
do
give
it
to
anyone
else
but
himself
swinton
looking
very
pale
and
uncomfortable
took
the
note
gingerly
between
his
fingers
himself
yes
he
stammered
and
er
if
there
should
be
no
one
what
do
you
mean
and
harland
frowned
in
his
own
particularly
unpleasant
way
there
sure
to
be
someone
even
if
he
were
the
devil
you
can
say
to
him
that
the
ladies
of
our
party
are
very
much
interested
in
the
beautiful
illumination
of
his
yacht
and
that
be
glad
to
see
him
on
board
ours
if
he
cares
to
come
be
as
polite
as
you
can
and
as
agreeable
as
you
like
it
has
not
occurred
to
you
i
suppose
you
have
not
thought
that
that
it
may
be
an
illusion
faltered
swinton
uneasily
glancing
at
the
glistening
sails
that
shamed
the
silver
sheen
of
the
moon
a
sort
of
mirage
in
the
atmosphere
harland
gave
vent
to
a
laugh
the
heartiest
i
had
ever
heard
from
him
upon
my
word
swinton
he
exclaimed
i
should
never
have
thought
you
capable
of
nerves
come
come
be
off
with
you
the
boat
is
lowered
all
ready
thus
commanded
there
was
nothing
for
the
reluctant
swinton
but
to
obey
and
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
his
evident
discomfiture
all
his
precise
and
was
gone
in
a
moment
he
was
nothing
but
a
very
timorous
creature
afraid
to
examine
into
what
he
could
not
at
once
understand
no
such
terrors
however
were
displayed
by
the
sailors
who
undertook
to
row
him
over
to
the
yacht
they
as
well
as
their
captain
were
anxious
to
discover
the
mystery
if
mystery
there
was
and
we
all
by
one
instinct
pressed
to
the
gangway
as
he
descended
the
companion
ladder
and
entered
the
boat
which
glided
away
immediately
with
a
low
and
rhythmical
plash
of
oars
we
could
watch
it
as
it
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
illuminated
vessel
and
our
excitement
grew
more
and
more
intense
for
once
harland
and
his
daughter
had
forgotten
all
about
themselves
and
customary
miserable
expression
of
face
had
altogether
disappeared
in
the
keenness
of
her
interest
for
something
more
immediately
thrilling
than
her
own
ailments
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
could
hardly
endure
the
suspense
that
seemed
to
weigh
on
every
nerve
of
my
body
during
the
few
minutes
interval
that
elapsed
between
the
departure
of
the
boat
and
its
drawing
up
alongside
the
strange
yacht
my
thoughts
were
all
in
a
whirl
i
felt
as
if
something
unprecedented
and
almost
terrifying
was
about
to
happen
but
i
could
not
reason
out
the
cause
of
my
mental
agitation
there
they
go
said
harland
they
alongside
see
those
fellows
are
lowering
the
companion
ladder
there
nothing
supernatural
about
them
swinton
all
right
look
he
on
board
we
strained
our
eyes
through
the
brilliant
flare
shed
by
the
illuminated
sails
on
the
darkness
and
could
see
swinton
talking
to
a
group
of
sailors
one
of
them
went
away
but
returned
almost
immediately
followed
by
a
man
clad
in
white
yachting
flannels
who
standing
near
one
of
the
shining
sails
caught
some
of
the
light
on
his
own
figure
with
undeniably
becoming
effect
i
was
the
first
to
perceive
him
and
as
i
looked
the
impression
came
upon
me
that
he
was
no
stranger
i
had
seen
him
often
before
this
sudden
consciousness
swiftly
borne
in
upon
me
calmed
all
the
previous
tumult
of
my
mind
and
i
was
no
longer
anxious
as
to
the
result
of
our
possible
acquaintance
catherine
harland
pressed
my
arm
excitedly
there
he
is
she
said
that
must
be
the
owner
of
the
yacht
reading
father
letter
he
was
we
could
see
the
little
sheet
of
paper
turning
over
in
his
hands
and
while
we
waited
wondering
what
would
be
his
answer
the
light
on
the
sails
of
his
vessel
began
to
pale
and
die
away
beam
after
beam
of
radiance
slipped
off
as
it
were
like
drops
of
water
and
before
we
could
quite
realise
it
there
was
darkness
where
all
had
lately
been
so
bright
and
the
canvas
was
hauled
down
with
the
quenching
of
that
intense
brilliancy
we
lost
sight
of
the
human
figures
on
deck
and
could
not
imagine
what
was
to
happen
next
the
dark
shore
looked
darker
than
ever
the
outline
of
the
yacht
was
now
truly
spectral
like
a
ship
of
black
cobweb
against
the
moon
and
we
looked
questioningly
at
each
other
in
silence
then
harland
spoke
in
a
low
tone
the
boat
is
coming
back
he
said
i
hear
the
oars
i
leaned
over
the
side
of
our
vessel
and
tried
to
see
through
the
gloom
how
still
the
water
was
not
a
ripple
disturbed
its
surface
but
there
were
strange
gleams
of
wandering
light
in
its
depths
like
dropped
jewels
lost
on
sands
far
below
the
regular
dip
of
oars
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
my
heart
was
beating
with
painful
quickness
i
could
not
understand
the
strange
feeling
that
overpowered
me
i
felt
as
if
my
very
soul
were
going
out
of
my
body
to
meet
that
oncoming
boat
which
was
cleaving
its
way
through
the
darkness
another
brief
interval
and
then
we
saw
it
shoot
out
into
a
patch
of
moonlight
we
could
perceive
swinton
seated
in
the
stern
with
another
figure
beside
him
that
of
a
man
who
stood
up
as
he
neared
our
yacht
and
lifted
his
cap
with
an
easy
gesture
of
salutation
and
then
as
the
boat
came
alongside
caught
at
the
guide
rope
and
sprang
lightly
on
the
first
step
of
the
companion
ladder
why
he
actually
come
over
to
us
himself
ejaculated
harland
and
he
hurried
to
the
gangway
just
in
time
to
receive
the
visitor
as
he
stepped
on
deck
well
harland
how
are
you
said
a
mellow
voice
in
the
cheeriest
of
accents
it
strange
we
should
meet
like
this
after
so
many
years
vi
recognition
at
these
words
and
at
sight
of
the
speaker
morton
harland
started
back
as
if
he
had
been
shot
santoris
he
exclaimed
not
possible
rafel
santoris
no
you
must
be
his
son
the
stranger
laughed
my
good
harland
always
the
sceptic
miracles
are
many
but
there
is
one
which
is
beyond
all
performance
a
man
can
not
be
his
own
offspring
i
am
that
very
santoris
who
saw
you
last
in
oxford
come
come
you
ought
to
know
me
he
stepped
more
fully
into
the
light
which
was
shed
from
the
open
door
of
the
deck
saloon
and
showed
himself
to
be
a
man
of
distinguished
appearance
apparently
about
forty
years
of
age
he
was
well
built
with
the
straight
back
and
broad
shoulders
of
an
athlete
his
face
was
finely
featured
and
radiant
with
the
glow
of
health
and
strength
and
as
he
smiled
and
laid
one
hand
on
harland
shoulder
he
looked
the
very
embodiment
of
active
powerful
manhood
morton
harland
stared
at
him
in
amazement
and
something
of
terror
rafel
santoris
he
repeated
you
are
his
living
image
but
you
can
not
be
himself
you
are
too
young
a
gleam
of
amusement
sparkled
in
the
stranger
eyes
do
let
us
talk
of
age
or
youth
for
the
moment
he
said
here
i
am
your
college
acquaintance
whom
you
and
several
other
fellows
fought
shy
of
years
ago
i
assure
you
i
am
quite
harmless
will
you
present
me
to
the
ladies
there
was
a
brief
embarrassed
pause
then
harland
turned
to
us
where
we
had
withdrawn
ourselves
a
little
apart
and
addressed
his
daughter
catherine
he
said
this
gentleman
tells
me
he
knew
me
at
oxford
and
if
he
is
right
i
also
knew
him
i
spoke
of
him
only
the
other
night
at
dinner
you
remember
but
i
did
not
tell
you
his
name
it
is
rafel
santoris
if
indeed
he
is
santoris
though
my
santoris
should
be
a
much
older
man
i
extremely
regret
said
our
visitor
then
advancing
and
bowing
courteously
to
catherine
and
myself
that
i
do
not
fulfil
the
required
conditions
of
age
will
you
try
to
forgive
me
he
smiled
and
we
were
a
little
confused
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
involuntarily
i
raised
my
eyes
to
his
and
with
one
glance
saw
in
those
clear
blue
orbs
that
so
steadfastly
met
mine
a
world
of
memories
memories
tender
wistful
and
pathetic
entangled
as
in
tears
and
fire
all
the
inward
instincts
of
my
spirit
told
me
that
i
knew
him
well
as
well
as
one
knows
the
gold
of
the
sunshine
or
the
colour
of
the
sky
yet
where
had
i
seen
him
often
and
often
before
while
my
thoughts
puzzled
over
this
question
he
averted
his
gaze
from
mine
and
went
on
speaking
to
catherine
i
understand
he
said
that
you
are
interested
in
the
lighting
of
my
yacht
it
is
most
beautiful
and
wonderful
answered
catherine
in
her
coldest
tone
of
conventional
politeness
and
so
unusual
his
eyebrows
went
up
with
a
slightly
quizzical
yes
i
suppose
it
is
unusual
he
said
i
am
always
forgetting
that
what
is
not
quite
common
seems
strange
but
really
the
arrangement
is
very
simple
the
yacht
is
called
the
and
she
is
as
her
name
implies
a
fulfilled
her
sails
are
her
only
motive
power
they
are
charged
with
electricity
and
that
is
why
they
shine
at
night
in
a
way
that
must
seem
to
outsiders
like
a
special
illumination
if
you
will
honour
me
with
a
visit
i
will
show
you
how
it
is
managed
here
captain
derrick
who
had
been
standing
close
by
was
unable
to
resist
the
impulse
of
his
curiosity
excuse
me
sir
he
said
suddenly
but
may
i
ask
how
it
is
you
sail
without
wind
certainly
you
may
ask
and
be
answered
santoris
replied
as
i
have
just
said
our
sails
are
our
only
motive
power
but
we
do
not
need
the
wind
to
fill
them
by
a
very
simple
scientific
method
or
rather
let
me
say
by
a
scientific
application
of
natural
means
we
generate
a
form
of
electric
force
from
the
air
and
water
as
we
move
this
force
fills
the
sails
and
propels
the
vessel
with
amazing
swiftness
wherever
she
is
steered
neither
calm
nor
storm
affects
her
progress
when
there
is
a
good
gale
blowing
our
way
we
naturally
lessen
the
draft
on
our
own
supplies
but
we
can
make
excellent
speed
even
in
the
teeth
of
a
contrary
wind
we
escape
all
the
inconveniences
of
steam
and
smoke
and
dirt
and
noise
and
i
daresay
in
about
a
couple
of
hundred
years
or
so
my
method
of
sailing
the
seas
will
be
applied
to
all
ships
large
and
small
with
much
wonder
that
it
was
not
thought
of
long
ago
why
not
apply
it
yourself
asked
brayle
now
joining
in
the
conversation
for
the
first
time
and
putting
the
question
with
an
air
of
incredulous
amusement
with
such
a
marvellous
discovery
if
it
is
yours
you
should
make
your
fortune
santoris
glanced
him
over
with
polite
tolerance
it
is
possible
i
do
not
need
to
make
it
he
answered
then
turning
again
to
captain
derrick
he
said
kindly
i
hope
the
matter
seems
clearer
to
you
we
sail
without
wind
it
is
true
but
not
without
the
power
that
creates
wind
the
captain
shook
his
head
perplexedly
well
sir
i
ca
quite
take
it
in
he
confessed
i
like
to
know
more
so
you
shall
harland
will
you
all
come
over
to
the
yacht
there
may
be
some
excursion
we
could
do
together
and
you
might
remain
and
dine
with
me
afterwards
harland
face
was
a
study
doubt
and
fear
struggled
for
the
mastery
in
his
expression
and
he
did
not
at
once
answer
then
he
seemed
to
conquer
his
hesitation
and
to
recover
himself
give
me
a
moment
with
you
alone
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
invitation
towards
the
deck
saloon
our
visitor
readily
complied
with
this
suggestion
and
the
two
men
entered
the
saloon
together
and
closed
the
door
silence
followed
catherine
looked
at
me
in
questioning
bewilderment
then
she
called
to
swinton
who
had
been
standing
about
as
though
awaiting
orders
in
his
usual
tiresome
and
servile
way
what
sort
of
an
interview
did
you
have
with
that
gentleman
when
you
got
on
board
his
yacht
she
asked
very
pleasant
very
pleasant
indeed
he
replied
the
vessel
is
magnificently
appointed
i
have
never
seen
such
luxury
extraordinary
more
than
princely
santoris
himself
i
found
particularly
agreeable
when
he
had
read
harland
note
he
said
he
was
glad
to
find
it
was
from
an
old
college
companion
and
that
he
would
come
over
with
me
to
renew
the
acquaintance
as
he
has
done
you
were
not
afraid
of
him
then
queried
brayle
sarcastically
oh
dear
no
he
seems
quite
and
i
should
say
he
must
be
very
wealthy
a
most
powerful
recommendation
murmured
brayle
the
best
in
the
world
what
do
you
think
of
him
he
asked
turning
suddenly
to
me
i
have
no
opinion
i
answered
quietly
how
could
i
say
otherwise
how
could
i
tell
such
a
man
as
he
was
of
one
who
had
entered
my
life
as
insistently
as
a
flash
of
light
illumining
all
that
had
hitherto
been
dark
at
that
moment
catherine
caught
my
hand
listen
she
whispered
a
window
of
the
deck
saloon
was
open
and
we
stood
near
it
brayle
and
swinton
had
moved
away
to
light
fresh
cigars
and
we
two
women
were
for
the
moment
alone
we
heard
harland
voice
raised
to
a
sort
of
smothered
cry
my
god
you
are
santoris
of
course
i
am
and
the
deep
answering
tones
were
full
of
music
the
music
of
a
grave
and
infinitely
tender
compassion
why
did
you
doubt
it
and
why
call
upon
god
that
is
a
name
which
has
no
meaning
for
you
there
followed
a
silence
i
looked
at
catherine
and
saw
her
pale
face
in
the
light
of
the
moon
haggard
in
line
and
older
than
her
years
and
my
heart
was
full
of
pity
for
her
she
was
excited
beyond
her
usual
could
see
that
the
appearance
of
the
stranger
from
the
yacht
had
aroused
her
interest
and
compelled
her
admiration
i
tried
to
draw
her
gently
to
a
farther
distance
from
the
saloon
but
she
would
not
move
we
ought
not
to
listen
i
said
catherine
come
away
she
shook
her
head
hush
she
softly
breathed
i
want
to
hear
just
then
harland
spoke
again
i
am
sorry
he
said
i
have
wronged
you
and
i
apologise
but
you
can
hardly
wonder
at
my
disbelief
considering
your
appearance
which
is
that
of
a
much
younger
man
than
your
actual
years
should
make
you
the
rich
voice
of
santoris
gave
answer
did
i
not
tell
you
and
others
long
ago
that
for
me
there
is
no
such
thing
as
time
but
only
eternity
the
soul
is
always
young
and
i
live
in
the
spirit
of
youth
not
in
the
matter
of
age
catherine
turned
her
eyes
upon
me
in
amazement
he
must
be
mad
she
said
i
made
no
reply
either
by
word
or
look
we
heard
harland
talking
but
in
a
lower
tone
and
we
could
not
distinguish
what
he
said
presently
santoris
answered
and
his
vibrant
tones
were
clear
and
distinct
why
should
it
seem
to
you
so
wonderful
he
said
you
do
not
think
it
miraculous
when
the
sculptor
standing
before
a
shapeless
block
of
marble
hews
it
out
to
conformity
with
his
inward
thought
the
marble
is
mere
marble
hard
to
deal
with
difficult
to
shape
yet
out
of
its
resisting
roughness
the
thinker
and
worker
can
mould
an
apollo
or
a
psyche
you
find
nothing
marvellous
in
this
though
the
result
of
its
shaping
is
due
to
nothing
but
thought
and
labour
yet
when
you
see
the
human
body
which
is
far
easier
to
shape
than
marble
brought
into
submission
by
the
same
forces
of
thought
and
labour
you
are
astonished
surely
it
is
a
simpler
matter
to
control
the
living
cells
of
one
own
fleshly
organisation
and
compel
them
to
do
the
bidding
of
the
dominating
spirit
than
to
chisel
the
semblance
of
a
god
out
of
a
block
of
stone
there
was
a
pause
after
this
then
followed
more
inaudible
talk
on
the
part
of
harland
and
while
we
yet
waited
to
gather
further
fragments
of
the
conversation
he
suddenly
threw
open
the
saloon
door
and
called
to
us
to
come
in
we
at
once
obeyed
the
summons
and
as
we
entered
he
said
in
a
somewhat
excited
nervous
way
i
must
apologise
before
you
ladies
for
the
rather
doubting
manner
in
which
i
received
my
former
college
friend
he
is
rafel
santoris
i
ought
to
have
known
that
there
only
one
of
his
type
but
the
curious
part
of
it
is
that
he
should
be
nearly
as
old
as
i
am
yet
somehow
he
is
not
i
laughed
it
would
have
been
hard
not
to
laugh
for
the
mere
idea
of
comparing
the
two
men
santoris
in
such
splendid
prime
and
morton
harland
in
his
bent
lean
and
wizened
condition
as
being
of
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
age
was
quite
ludicrous
even
catherine
smiled
a
weak
and
timorous
smile
i
suppose
you
have
grown
old
more
quickly
father
she
said
perhaps
santoris
has
not
lived
at
such
high
pressure
santoris
standing
by
the
saloon
centre
table
tinder
the
full
blaze
of
the
electric
lamp
looked
at
her
with
a
kindly
interest
high
or
low
i
live
each
moment
of
my
days
to
the
full
miss
harland
he
said
i
do
not
drowse
it
or
kill
it
i
live
it
this
lady
and
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
me
looks
as
if
she
did
the
same
she
does
said
harland
quickly
and
with
emphasis
that
quite
true
you
were
always
a
good
reader
of
character
santoris
i
believe
i
have
not
introduced
you
properly
to
our
little
friend
here
he
presented
me
by
name
and
i
held
out
my
hand
santoris
took
it
in
his
own
with
a
light
warm
clasp
gently
releasing
it
again
as
he
bowed
i
call
her
our
little
friend
because
she
brings
such
an
atmosphere
of
joy
along
with
her
wherever
she
goes
we
persuaded
her
to
come
with
us
yachting
this
summer
for
a
very
selfish
reason
because
we
are
disposed
to
be
dull
and
she
is
always
bright
the
advantage
you
see
is
all
on
our
side
oddly
enough
i
was
talking
to
her
about
you
the
other
night
the
very
night
by
the
by
that
your
yacht
came
behind
us
off
mull
that
was
rather
a
curious
coincidence
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
not
curious
at
all
said
santoris
but
perfectly
natural
when
will
you
realise
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
but
only
a
very
exact
system
of
mathematics
harland
gave
a
slight
incredulous
gesture
your
theories
again
he
said
you
hold
to
them
still
but
our
little
friend
is
likely
to
agree
with
you
when
i
was
speaking
of
you
to
her
i
told
her
she
had
somewhat
the
same
ideas
as
yourself
she
is
a
sort
of
a
whatever
that
may
mean
do
you
not
know
queried
santoris
with
a
grave
smile
it
is
easy
to
guess
by
merely
looking
at
her
my
cheeks
grew
warm
and
my
eyes
fell
beneath
his
steadfast
gaze
i
wondered
whether
harland
or
catherine
would
notice
that
in
his
coat
he
wore
a
small
bunch
of
the
same
kind
of
bright
pink
which
was
my
only
of
adorning
that
night
the
ice
of
introductory
recognition
being
broken
we
gathered
round
the
saloon
table
and
sat
down
while
the
steward
brought
wine
and
other
refreshments
to
offer
to
our
guest
harland
former
uneasiness
and
embarrassment
seemed
now
at
an
end
and
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
pleasure
of
renewing
association
with
one
who
had
known
him
as
a
young
man
and
they
began
talking
easily
together
of
their
days
at
college
of
the
men
they
had
both
been
acquainted
with
some
of
whom
were
dead
some
settled
abroad
and
some
lost
to
sight
in
the
vistas
of
uncertain
fate
catherine
took
very
little
part
in
the
conversation
but
she
listened
intently
her
colourless
eyes
were
for
once
bright
and
she
watched
the
face
of
santoris
as
one
might
watch
an
animated
picture
presently
brayle
and
swinton
who
had
been
pacing
the
deck
together
and
smoking
paused
near
the
saloon
door
harland
beckoned
them
come
in
come
in
he
said
santoris
this
is
my
physician
brayle
who
has
undertaken
to
look
after
me
during
this
trip
santoris
bowed
and
this
is
my
secretary
swinton
whom
i
sent
over
to
your
yacht
just
now
again
santoris
bowed
his
slight
yet
perfectly
courteous
salutation
was
in
marked
contrast
with
the
careless
modern
nod
or
jerk
of
the
head
by
which
the
other
men
barely
acknowledged
their
introduction
to
him
he
was
afraid
of
his
life
to
go
to
you
continued
harland
with
a
laugh
he
thought
you
might
be
an
illusion
or
even
the
devil
himself
with
those
fiery
sails
swinton
looked
sheepish
santoris
smiled
this
fair
dreamer
of
dreams
here
he
singled
me
out
for
notice
is
the
only
one
of
us
who
has
not
expressed
either
surprise
or
fear
at
the
sight
of
your
vessel
or
the
possible
knowledge
of
yourself
though
there
was
one
little
incident
connected
with
the
pretty
bunch
of
she
is
wearing
why
you
wear
the
same
flower
yourself
there
was
a
moment
silence
everyone
stared
the
blood
burned
in
my
veins
i
felt
my
face
crimsoning
yet
i
knew
not
why
i
should
be
embarrassed
or
at
a
loss
for
words
santoris
came
to
my
relief
there
nothing
remarkable
in
that
is
there
he
queried
lightly
is
quite
common
in
this
part
of
the
world
i
should
like
to
try
and
count
up
the
number
of
tourists
i
lately
seen
wearing
it
ah
but
you
do
know
the
interest
attaching
to
this
particular
specimen
persisted
harland
it
was
given
to
our
little
friend
by
a
wild
highland
fellow
presumably
a
native
of
mull
the
very
morning
after
she
had
seen
your
yacht
for
the
first
time
and
he
told
her
that
on
the
previous
night
he
had
brought
all
of
the
same
kind
he
could
gather
to
you
surely
you
see
the
connection
santoris
shook
his
head
i
afraid
i
do
he
said
smilingly
did
the
highland
fellow
name
me
no
i
believe
he
called
you
shentleman
that
owns
the
yacht
oh
well
and
santoris
laughed
there
are
so
many
that
own
yachts
he
may
have
got
mixed
in
his
customers
in
any
case
i
am
glad
to
have
some
little
thing
in
common
with
your
friend
if
only
a
bunch
of
heather
her
bunch
behaves
very
curiously
put
in
catherine
it
never
fades
santoris
made
no
comment
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
not
heard
or
did
not
wish
to
hear
he
changed
the
conversation
much
to
my
comfort
and
for
the
rest
of
the
time
he
stayed
with
us
rather
avoided
speaking
to
me
though
once
or
twice
i
met
his
eyes
fixed
earnestly
upon
me
the
talk
drifted
in
a
desultory
manner
round
various
ordinary
topics
and
i
moving
a
little
aside
took
a
seat
near
the
window
where
i
could
watch
the
striking
a
glitter
on
the
still
waters
of
loch
scavaig
and
at
the
same
time
hear
all
that
was
being
said
without
taking
any
part
in
it
i
did
not
wish
to
speak
the
uplifted
joy
of
my
soul
was
too
intense
for
anything
but
silence
i
could
not
tell
why
i
was
so
happy
i
only
knew
by
inward
instinct
that
some
point
in
my
life
had
been
reached
towards
which
i
had
striven
for
a
far
longer
period
than
i
myself
was
aware
of
there
was
nothing
for
me
now
but
to
wait
with
faith
and
patience
for
the
next
step
forward
a
step
which
i
felt
would
not
be
taken
alone
and
i
listened
with
interest
while
harland
put
his
former
college
friend
through
a
kind
of
inquisitorial
examination
as
to
what
he
had
been
doing
and
where
he
had
been
journeying
since
they
last
met
santoris
seemed
not
at
all
unwilling
to
be
catechised
when
i
escaped
from
oxford
he
said
but
here
harland
interposed
escaped
he
exclaimed
you
talk
as
if
you
had
been
kept
in
prison
so
i
was
santoris
replied
oxford
is
a
prison
to
all
who
want
to
feed
on
something
more
than
the
dry
bones
of
learning
while
there
i
was
like
the
prodigal
son
exiled
from
my
father
house
and
i
eat
the
husks
that
the
swine
did
eat
many
fellows
have
to
do
the
same
sometimes
though
not
often
a
man
arrives
with
a
constitution
unsuited
to
husks
mine
was
and
is
such
an
one
you
secured
honours
with
the
husks
said
harland
santoris
gave
a
gesture
of
airy
contempt
honours
such
honours
any
fellow
unaddicted
to
drinking
with
a
fair
amount
of
determined
plod
could
win
them
the
alleged
in
the
way
are
perfectly
childish
they
scarcely
deserve
to
be
called
the
pothooks
and
hangers
of
an
education
i
always
got
my
work
done
in
two
or
three
hours
the
rest
of
my
time
at
college
was
pure
leisure
which
i
employed
in
other
and
wiser
forms
of
study
than
those
of
the
general
curriculum
as
you
know
you
mean
occult
mysteries
and
things
of
that
sort
is
a
word
of
such
new
coinage
that
it
is
not
found
in
many
dictionaries
said
santoris
with
a
mirthful
look
you
will
not
find
it
for
instance
in
the
earlier
editions
of
stormonth
reliable
compendium
i
do
not
care
for
it
myself
i
prefer
to
say
science
you
believe
in
that
asked
catherine
abruptly
assuredly
how
can
i
do
otherwise
seeing
that
it
is
the
key
to
the
soul
of
nature
that
too
deep
for
me
said
brayle
pouring
himself
out
a
glass
of
whisky
and
mixing
it
with
if
it
a
riddle
i
give
it
up
santoris
was
silent
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
catherine
leaned
forward
across
the
table
looking
at
him
with
tired
questioning
eyes
could
you
not
explain
she
murmured
easily
he
answered
anyone
can
understand
it
with
a
little
attention
what
i
mean
is
this
you
know
that
the
human
body
outwardly
expresses
its
inward
condition
of
health
mentality
and
spirituality
well
in
exactly
the
same
way
nature
in
her
countless
varying
presentations
of
beauty
and
wisdom
expresses
the
soul
of
herself
or
the
spiritual
force
which
supports
her
existence
science
is
the
knowledge
not
of
the
outward
effect
so
much
as
of
the
inward
cause
which
makes
the
effect
manifest
it
is
a
knowledge
which
can
be
applied
to
the
individual
daily
uses
of
life
the
more
it
is
studied
the
more
reward
it
bestows
and
the
smallest
portion
of
it
thoroughly
mastered
is
bound
to
lead
to
some
discovery
simple
or
complex
which
lifts
the
immortal
part
of
a
man
a
step
higher
on
the
way
it
should
go
you
are
satisfied
with
your
researches
then
asked
harland
santoris
smiled
gravely
do
i
look
like
a
man
that
has
failed
he
answered
harland
studied
his
handsome
face
and
figure
with
envy
you
went
abroad
from
oxford
he
queried
yes
i
went
back
to
the
old
home
in
egypt
the
house
where
i
was
born
and
bred
it
had
been
well
kept
and
cared
for
by
the
faithful
servant
to
whom
my
father
had
entrusted
it
as
well
kept
as
a
royal
chamber
in
the
pyramids
with
the
funeral
offerings
untouched
and
a
perpetual
lamp
burning
it
was
the
best
of
all
possible
places
in
which
to
continue
my
particular
line
of
work
without
interruption
and
i
have
stayed
there
most
of
the
time
only
coming
away
as
now
when
necessary
for
a
change
and
a
look
at
the
world
as
the
world
lives
in
these
days
and
here
harland
hesitated
then
went
on
are
you
married
santoris
lifted
his
eyes
and
regarded
his
former
college
acquaintance
fixedly
that
question
is
unnecessary
he
said
you
know
i
am
not
there
was
a
brief
awkward
pause
brayle
looked
up
with
a
satirical
smile
spiritual
science
has
probably
taught
you
to
beware
of
the
fair
sex
he
said
i
do
not
entirely
understand
you
answered
santoris
coldly
but
if
you
mean
that
i
am
not
a
lover
of
women
in
the
plural
you
are
right
perhaps
of
the
one
woman
the
one
rare
pearl
in
the
deep
sea
hinted
brayle
unabashed
come
you
are
getting
too
personal
brayle
interrupted
harland
quickly
and
with
asperity
santoris
your
health
he
raised
a
glass
of
wine
to
his
lips
santoris
did
the
same
and
this
simple
courtesy
between
the
two
principals
in
the
conversation
had
the
effect
of
putting
their
subordinate
in
his
proper
place
it
seems
superfluous
to
wish
health
to
santoris
said
catherine
then
he
evidently
has
it
in
perfection
santoris
looked
at
her
with
kindly
interest
health
is
a
law
miss
harland
he
said
it
is
our
own
fault
if
we
trespass
against
it
ah
you
say
that
because
you
are
well
and
strong
she
answered
in
a
plaintive
tone
but
if
you
were
afflicted
and
suffering
you
would
take
a
different
view
of
illness
he
smiled
somewhat
compassionately
i
think
not
he
said
if
i
were
afflicted
and
suffering
as
you
say
i
should
know
that
by
my
own
neglect
thoughtlessness
carelessness
or
selfishness
i
had
injured
my
organisation
mentally
and
physically
and
that
therefore
the
penalty
demanded
was
just
and
reasonable
surely
you
do
not
maintain
that
a
man
is
responsible
for
his
own
ailments
said
harland
that
would
be
too
even
for
you
why
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
wretched
human
being
is
not
only
cursed
with
his
own
poisoned
blood
but
with
the
poisoned
blood
of
his
forefathers
and
according
to
the
latest
medical
science
the
very
air
and
water
swarm
with
germs
of
death
for
the
unsuspecting
victim
or
germs
of
life
said
santoris
quietly
according
to
my
knowledge
or
as
you
prefer
to
call
it
there
are
no
germs
of
actual
death
there
are
germs
which
disintegrate
effete
forms
of
matter
merely
to
allow
the
forces
of
life
to
rebuild
them
again
and
these
may
propagate
in
the
human
system
if
it
so
happens
that
the
human
system
is
prepared
to
receive
them
their
devastating
process
is
called
disease
but
they
never
begin
their
work
till
the
being
they
attack
has
either
wasted
a
vital
opportunity
or
neglected
a
vital
necessity
far
more
numerous
are
the
beneficial
germs
of
revivifying
and
creative
power
and
if
these
find
place
they
are
bound
to
conquer
those
whose
agency
is
destructive
it
all
depends
on
the
soil
and
pasture
you
offer
them
evil
thoughts
make
evil
blood
and
in
evil
blood
disease
germinates
and
flourishes
pure
thoughts
make
pure
blood
and
rebuild
the
cells
of
health
and
vitality
i
grant
you
there
is
such
a
thing
as
inherited
disease
but
this
could
be
prevented
in
a
great
measure
by
making
the
marriage
of
diseased
persons
a
criminal
offence
while
much
of
it
could
be
driven
out
by
proper
care
in
childhood
unfortunately
the
proper
care
is
seldom
given
what
would
you
call
proper
care
asked
catherine
entire
absence
of
to
begin
with
he
answered
no
child
should
be
permitted
to
have
its
own
way
or
expect
to
have
it
the
first
great
lesson
of
life
should
be
renunciation
of
self
a
faint
colour
crept
into
catherine
faded
cheeks
harland
fidgeted
in
his
chair
unless
a
man
looks
after
himself
no
one
else
will
look
after
him
he
said
reasonable
care
of
one
self
is
unselfishness
replied
santoris
but
anything
in
excess
of
reasonable
care
is
pure
vice
a
man
should
work
for
his
livelihood
chiefly
in
order
not
to
become
a
burden
on
others
in
the
same
way
he
should
take
care
of
his
health
so
that
he
may
avoid
being
a
troublesome
invalid
dependent
on
compassion
to
be
ill
is
to
acknowledge
neglect
of
existing
laws
and
incapacity
of
resistance
to
evil
you
lay
down
a
very
hard
and
fast
rule
santoris
said
brayle
many
unfortunate
people
are
ill
through
no
fault
of
their
own
pardon
me
for
my
dogmatism
when
i
say
such
a
thing
is
impossible
answered
santoris
if
a
human
being
starts
his
life
in
health
he
can
not
be
ill
unless
through
some
fault
of
his
own
it
may
be
a
moral
or
a
physical
fault
but
the
trespass
against
the
law
has
been
made
and
suppose
him
to
be
born
with
some
inherited
trouble
he
can
eliminate
even
that
from
his
blood
if
he
so
determines
man
was
not
meant
to
be
sickly
but
strong
he
is
not
intended
to
dwell
on
this
earth
as
a
servant
but
as
a
master
and
all
the
elements
of
strength
and
individual
sovereignty
are
contained
in
nature
for
his
use
and
advantage
if
he
will
but
accept
them
as
frankly
as
they
are
offered
ungrudgingly
i
can
not
grant
you
and
he
smiled
even
the
smallest
amount
of
voluntary
or
intended
mischief
in
the
divine
plan
at
that
moment
captain
derrick
looked
in
at
the
saloon
door
to
remind
us
that
the
boat
was
still
waiting
to
take
our
visitor
back
to
his
own
yacht
he
rose
at
once
with
a
briefly
courteous
apology
for
having
stayed
so
long
and
we
all
vent
with
him
to
see
him
off
it
was
arranged
that
we
were
to
join
him
on
board
his
vessel
next
day
and
either
take
a
sail
with
him
along
the
island
coast
or
else
do
the
excursion
on
foot
to
loch
coruisk
which
was
a
point
not
to
be
missed
as
we
walked
all
together
along
the
moonlit
deck
a
chance
moment
placed
him
by
my
side
while
the
others
were
moving
on
ahead
i
felt
rather
than
saw
his
eyes
upon
me
and
looked
up
swiftly
in
obedience
to
his
compelling
glance
there
was
a
light
of
eloquent
meaning
in
the
expression
of
his
face
but
he
spoke
in
perfectly
conventional
tones
i
am
glad
to
have
met
you
at
last
he
said
quietly
i
have
known
you
by
name
and
in
the
spirit
a
long
time
i
did
not
answer
my
heart
was
beating
rapidly
with
an
excitation
of
nameless
joy
and
fear
commingled
he
went
on
we
shall
be
able
to
talk
together
i
hope
i
feel
that
there
are
many
things
in
which
we
are
mutually
interested
still
i
could
not
speak
sometimes
it
happens
he
continued
in
a
voice
that
trembled
a
little
that
two
people
who
are
not
immediately
conscious
of
having
met
before
feel
on
first
introduction
to
each
other
as
if
they
were
quite
old
friends
is
it
not
so
i
murmured
a
scarcely
audible
assent
he
bent
his
head
and
looked
at
me
searchingly
a
smile
was
on
his
lips
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
tenderness
till
is
not
long
to
wait
he
said
not
long
after
so
many
years
a
sense
of
calm
and
sweet
assurance
swept
over
me
i
answered
with
a
smile
of
happy
response
to
his
own
till
we
were
close
to
the
gangway
where
the
others
already
stood
in
another
couple
of
minutes
he
had
made
his
adieux
to
our
whole
party
and
was
on
his
way
back
to
his
own
vessel
the
boat
in
which
he
sat
rowed
strongly
by
our
men
soon
disappeared
like
a
black
blot
on
the
general
darkness
of
the
water
yet
we
remained
for
some
time
watching
as
though
we
could
see
it
even
when
it
was
no
longer
visible
a
strange
fellow
said
brayle
when
we
moved
away
at
last
flinging
the
end
of
his
cigar
over
the
yacht
side
something
of
madness
and
genius
combined
harland
turned
quickly
upon
him
you
mistake
he
answered
there
no
madness
though
there
is
certainly
genius
he
of
the
same
mind
as
he
was
when
i
knew
him
at
college
there
never
was
a
saner
or
more
brilliant
scholar
it
curious
you
should
meet
him
again
like
this
said
catherine
but
surely
father
he
not
as
old
as
you
are
he
about
three
and
a
half
years
younger
that
all
brayle
laughed
i
do
believe
it
for
a
moment
he
said
i
think
he
playing
a
part
he
probably
not
the
man
you
knew
at
oxford
at
all
we
were
then
going
to
our
cabins
for
the
night
and
harland
paused
as
these
words
were
said
and
faced
us
he
is
the
man
he
said
emphatically
i
had
my
doubts
of
him
at
first
but
i
was
wrong
as
for
a
part
that
would
be
impossible
to
him
he
is
absolutely
truthful
almost
to
the
verge
of
cruelty
a
curious
expression
came
into
his
eyes
as
of
hidden
fear
in
one
way
i
am
glad
to
have
met
him
again
in
another
i
am
sorry
for
he
is
a
disturber
of
the
comfortable
peace
of
conventions
you
here
he
regarded
me
suddenly
as
if
he
had
almost
forgotten
my
presence
will
like
him
you
have
many
ideas
in
common
and
will
be
sure
to
get
on
well
together
as
for
me
i
am
his
direct
opposite
the
two
poles
are
not
wider
apart
than
we
are
in
our
feelings
sentiments
and
beliefs
he
paused
seeming
to
be
troubled
by
the
passing
cloud
of
some
painful
thought
then
he
went
on
there
is
one
thing
i
should
perhaps
explain
especially
to
you
brayle
to
save
useless
argument
it
is
of
course
a
but
craze
or
not
he
is
absolutely
immovable
on
one
point
which
he
calls
the
great
fact
of
life
that
there
is
and
can
be
no
death
that
life
is
eternal
and
therefore
in
all
its
forms
indestructible
does
he
consider
himself
immune
from
the
common
lot
of
mortals
asked
brayle
with
a
touch
of
derision
he
denies
common
lot
altogether
replied
harland
for
him
each
individual
life
is
a
perpetual
succession
of
progressive
changes
and
he
holds
that
a
change
is
never
and
can
never
be
made
till
the
person
concerned
has
prepared
the
next
or
mortal
presentment
of
immortal
being
according
to
voluntary
choice
and
liking
then
he
is
mad
exclaimed
catherine
he
must
be
mad
i
smiled
then
i
am
mad
too
i
said
for
i
believe
as
he
does
may
i
say
and
with
that
i
left
them
glad
to
be
alone
with
myself
and
my
secret
rapture
vii
memories
perfect
happiness
is
the
soul
acceptance
of
a
sense
of
joy
without
question
and
this
is
what
i
felt
through
all
my
being
on
that
night
just
as
a
tree
may
be
glad
of
the
soft
wind
blowing
its
leaves
or
a
daisy
in
the
grass
may
rejoice
in
the
warmth
of
the
sun
to
which
it
opens
its
golden
heart
without
either
being
able
to
explain
the
delicious
ecstasy
so
i
was
the
recipient
of
light
and
exquisite
felicity
which
could
have
no
explanation
or
analysis
i
did
not
try
to
think
it
was
enough
for
me
simply
to
be
i
realised
of
course
that
with
the
harlands
and
their
two
paid
attendants
the
materialist
brayle
and
the
secretarial
machine
swinton
rafel
santoris
could
have
nothing
in
common
and
as
i
know
by
daily
experience
that
not
even
the
most
trifling
event
happens
without
a
predestined
cause
for
its
occurrence
and
a
purpose
in
its
result
i
was
sure
that
the
reason
for
his
coming
into
touch
with
us
at
all
was
to
be
found
in
connection
through
some
mysterious
intuition
with
myself
however
as
i
say
i
did
not
think
about
it
i
was
content
to
breathe
the
invigorating
air
of
peace
and
serenity
in
which
my
spirit
seemed
to
float
on
wings
i
slept
like
a
child
who
is
only
tired
out
with
play
and
pleasure
i
woke
like
a
child
to
whom
the
world
is
all
new
and
brimful
of
beauty
that
it
was
a
sunny
day
seemed
right
and
natural
clouds
and
rain
could
hardly
have
penetrated
the
brilliant
atmosphere
in
which
i
lived
and
moved
it
was
an
atmosphere
of
my
own
creating
of
course
and
therefore
not
liable
to
be
disturbed
by
storms
unless
i
chose
it
is
possible
for
every
human
being
to
live
in
the
sunshine
of
the
soul
whatever
may
be
the
material
surroundings
of
the
body
the
person
would
have
said
to
me
are
you
happy
there
is
no
real
cause
for
this
sudden
elation
you
think
you
have
met
someone
who
is
in
sympathy
with
your
tastes
ideas
and
feelings
but
you
may
be
quite
wrong
and
this
bright
wave
of
joy
into
which
you
are
plunging
heedlessly
may
fling
you
bruised
and
broken
on
a
desolate
shore
for
the
remainder
of
your
life
one
would
think
you
had
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
to
which
i
should
have
replied
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
falling
in
love
at
first
sight
that
the
very
expression
in
love
conveys
a
false
idea
and
that
what
the
world
generally
calls
is
not
love
at
all
moreover
there
was
nothing
in
my
heart
or
mind
with
regard
to
rafel
santoris
save
a
keen
interest
and
sense
of
friendship
i
was
sure
that
his
beliefs
were
the
same
as
mine
and
that
he
had
been
working
along
the
same
lines
which
i
had
endeavoured
to
follow
and
just
as
two
musicians
inspired
by
a
mutual
love
of
their
art
may
be
glad
to
play
their
instruments
together
in
time
and
tune
even
so
i
felt
that
he
and
i
had
met
on
a
plane
of
thought
where
we
had
both
for
a
long
time
been
separately
wandering
the
yacht
with
its
white
sails
spread
ready
for
a
cruise
was
as
beautiful
by
day
in
the
sunshine
under
a
blue
sky
as
by
night
with
its
own
electric
radiance
flashing
its
outline
against
the
stars
and
i
was
eager
to
be
on
board
we
were
however
delayed
by
an
of
nerves
on
the
part
of
catherine
who
during
the
morning
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
hysteria
to
which
she
completely
gave
way
sobbing
laughing
and
gasping
for
breath
in
a
manner
which
showed
her
to
be
quite
unhinged
and
swept
from
brayle
took
her
at
once
in
charge
while
harland
fumed
and
fretted
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
saloon
with
an
angry
face
and
brooding
eyes
he
looked
at
me
where
i
stood
waiting
ready
dressed
for
the
excursion
of
the
day
and
said
i
sorry
for
all
this
worry
catherine
gets
worse
and
worse
her
nerves
tear
her
to
pieces
she
allows
them
to
do
so
i
answered
and
brayle
allows
her
to
give
them
their
way
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
do
like
brayle
he
said
but
he
clever
and
he
does
his
best
to
keep
his
patients
i
hinted
with
a
smile
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
faced
me
well
now
come
he
said
could
you
cure
her
i
could
have
cured
her
in
the
beginning
i
replied
but
hardly
now
no
one
can
cure
her
now
but
herself
he
paced
up
and
down
again
she
wo
be
able
to
go
with
us
to
visit
santoris
he
said
i
sure
of
that
shall
we
put
it
off
i
suggested
his
eyebrows
went
up
in
surprise
at
me
why
no
certainly
not
it
will
be
a
change
for
you
and
a
pleasure
of
which
i
would
not
deprive
you
besides
i
want
to
go
myself
but
catherine
brayle
here
entered
the
saloon
with
his
softest
step
and
most
professional
manner
miss
harland
is
better
now
he
said
she
will
be
quite
calm
in
a
few
minutes
but
she
must
remain
quiet
it
will
not
be
safe
for
her
to
attempt
any
excursion
today
well
that
need
not
prevent
the
rest
of
us
from
going
said
harland
oh
no
certainly
not
in
fact
miss
harland
said
she
hoped
you
would
go
and
make
her
excuses
to
santoris
i
shall
of
course
be
in
attendance
on
her
you
wo
come
then
and
an
unconscious
look
of
relief
brightened
harland
features
and
as
swinton
does
wish
to
join
us
we
shall
be
only
a
party
of
three
captain
derrick
myself
and
our
little
friend
here
we
may
as
well
be
off
is
the
boat
ready
we
were
informed
that
santoris
had
sent
his
own
boat
and
men
to
fetch
us
and
that
they
had
been
waiting
for
some
few
minutes
we
at
once
prepared
to
go
and
while
harland
was
getting
his
overcoat
and
searching
for
his
brayle
spoke
to
me
in
a
low
tone
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
miss
harland
has
been
greatly
upset
by
the
visit
of
santoris
and
by
some
of
the
things
he
said
last
night
she
could
not
sleep
and
was
exceedingly
troubled
in
her
mind
by
the
most
distressing
thoughts
i
am
very
glad
she
has
decided
not
to
see
him
again
do
you
consider
his
influence
harmful
i
queried
somewhat
amused
i
consider
him
not
quite
sane
brayle
answered
coldly
and
highly
nervous
persons
like
miss
harland
are
best
without
the
society
of
clever
but
wholly
irresponsible
theorists
the
colour
burned
in
my
cheeks
you
include
me
in
that
category
of
course
i
said
quietly
for
i
said
last
night
that
if
santoris
was
mad
then
i
am
too
for
i
hold
the
same
views
he
smiled
a
superior
smile
there
is
no
harm
in
you
he
answered
condescendingly
you
may
think
what
you
like
you
are
only
a
woman
very
clever
very
charming
and
full
of
the
most
delightful
fancies
but
weighted
fortunately
with
the
restrictions
of
your
sex
i
mean
no
offence
i
assure
you
but
a
woman
whatever
they
are
are
never
accepted
by
rational
beings
i
laughed
i
see
and
rational
beings
must
always
be
men
i
said
you
are
quite
certain
of
that
in
the
fact
that
men
ordain
the
world
government
and
progress
you
have
your
answer
he
replied
alas
poor
world
i
murmured
sometimes
it
rebels
against
the
of
its
rulers
just
then
harland
called
me
and
i
hastened
to
join
him
and
captain
derrick
the
boat
which
was
waiting
for
us
was
manned
by
four
sailors
who
wore
white
jerseys
trimmed
with
scarlet
bearing
the
name
of
the
yacht
to
which
they
belonged
the
these
men
were
and
we
took
them
at
first
for
portuguese
or
malays
but
they
turned
out
to
be
from
egypt
they
saluted
us
but
did
not
speak
and
as
soon
as
we
were
seated
pulled
swiftly
away
across
the
water
captain
derrick
watched
their
movements
with
great
interest
and
curiosity
plenty
of
grit
in
those
chaps
he
said
aside
to
harland
look
at
their
muscular
arms
i
suppose
they
do
speak
a
word
of
english
harland
thereupon
tried
one
of
them
with
a
remark
about
the
weather
the
man
smiled
and
the
sudden
gleam
of
his
white
teeth
gave
a
wonderful
light
and
charm
to
his
naturally
grave
cast
of
countenance
beautiful
day
he
said
very
happy
sky
this
expression
sky
attracted
me
it
recalled
to
my
mind
a
phrase
i
had
once
read
in
the
translation
of
an
inscription
found
in
an
egyptian
sarcophagus
the
peace
of
the
morning
befriend
thee
and
the
light
of
the
sunset
and
the
happiness
of
the
sky
the
words
rang
in
my
ears
with
an
odd
familiarity
like
the
verse
of
some
poem
loved
and
learned
by
heart
in
childhood
in
a
very
few
minutes
we
were
alongside
the
and
soon
on
board
where
rafel
santoris
received
us
with
kindly
courtesy
and
warmth
of
welcome
he
expressed
polite
regret
at
the
absence
of
miss
harland
none
for
that
of
brayle
or
swinton
and
then
introduced
us
to
his
captain
an
italian
named
marino
fazio
of
whom
santoris
said
to
us
smilingly
he
is
a
scientist
as
well
as
a
skipper
and
he
needs
to
be
both
in
the
management
of
such
a
vessel
as
this
he
will
take
captain
derrick
in
his
charge
and
explain
to
him
the
mystery
of
our
brilliant
appearance
at
night
and
also
the
secret
of
our
sailing
without
wind
fazio
saluted
and
smiled
a
cheerful
response
are
you
ready
to
start
now
he
asked
speaking
very
good
english
with
just
the
slightest
trace
of
a
foreign
accent
perfectly
fazio
lifted
his
hand
with
a
sign
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
another
moment
and
the
yacht
began
to
move
without
the
slightest
noise
without
the
grinding
of
ropes
or
rattling
of
chains
or
creaking
boards
she
swung
gracefully
round
and
began
to
glide
through
the
water
with
a
swiftness
that
was
almost
incredible
the
sails
filled
though
the
air
was
intensely
warm
and
stirless
an
air
in
which
any
ordinary
schooner
would
have
been
hopelessly
becalmed
and
almost
before
we
knew
it
we
were
out
of
loch
scavaig
and
flying
as
though
borne
on
the
wings
of
some
great
white
bird
all
along
the
wild
and
picturesque
coast
of
skye
towards
loch
bracadale
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
about
the
yacht
was
the
extraordinary
lightness
with
which
she
skimmed
the
waves
she
seemed
to
ride
on
their
surface
rather
than
part
them
with
her
keel
everything
on
board
expressed
the
finest
taste
as
well
as
the
most
perfect
convenience
and
i
saw
plarland
gazing
about
him
in
utter
amazement
at
the
elegant
sumptuousness
of
his
surroundings
santoris
showed
us
all
over
the
vessel
talking
to
us
with
the
ease
of
quite
an
old
friend
you
know
the
familiar
axiom
he
said
worth
doing
at
all
is
worth
doing
well
the
was
first
of
all
nothing
but
a
dream
in
my
brain
till
i
set
to
work
with
fazio
and
made
it
a
reality
owing
to
our
discovery
of
the
way
in
which
to
compel
the
waters
to
serve
us
as
our
motive
power
we
have
no
blackening
smoke
or
steam
so
that
our
furniture
and
fittings
are
preserved
from
dinginess
and
tarnish
it
was
possible
to
have
the
saloon
delicately
painted
as
you
see
here
he
opened
the
door
of
the
apartment
mentioned
and
we
stepped
into
it
as
into
a
fairy
palace
it
was
much
loftier
than
the
usual
yacht
saloon
and
on
all
sides
the
windows
were
oval
shaped
set
in
between
the
most
exquisitely
painted
panels
of
sea
pieces
evidently
the
work
of
some
great
artist
overhead
the
ceiling
was
draped
with
pale
turquoise
blue
silk
forming
a
canopy
which
was
gathered
in
rich
folds
on
all
four
sides
having
in
its
centre
a
crystal
lamp
in
the
shape
of
a
star
you
live
like
a
king
then
said
harland
a
trifle
bitterly
you
know
how
to
use
your
father
fortune
my
father
fortune
was
made
to
be
used
answered
santoris
with
perfect
and
i
think
he
is
perfectly
satisfied
with
my
mode
of
expending
it
but
very
little
of
it
has
been
touched
i
have
made
my
own
fortune
indeed
how
and
harland
looked
as
he
evidently
felt
keenly
interested
ah
that
asking
too
much
of
me
laughed
santoris
you
may
be
satisfied
however
that
it
not
through
defrauding
my
neighbours
it
comparatively
easy
to
be
rich
if
you
have
coaxed
any
of
mother
nature
secrets
out
of
her
she
is
very
kind
to
her
children
if
they
are
kind
to
her
in
fact
she
spoils
them
for
the
more
they
ask
of
her
the
more
she
gives
besides
every
man
should
make
his
own
money
even
if
he
inherits
wealth
it
is
the
only
way
to
feel
worthy
of
a
place
in
this
beautiful
world
he
preceded
us
out
of
the
saloon
and
showed
us
the
of
which
there
were
five
daintily
furnished
in
white
and
blue
and
white
and
rose
these
are
for
my
guests
when
i
have
any
he
said
which
is
very
seldom
this
for
a
princess
if
ever
one
should
honour
me
with
her
presence
and
he
opened
a
door
on
his
right
through
which
we
peered
into
a
long
lovely
room
gleaming
with
iridescent
hues
and
sparkling
with
touches
of
gold
and
crystal
the
bed
was
draped
with
cloudy
lace
through
which
a
shimmer
of
pale
made
itself
visible
and
the
carpet
of
dark
formed
a
perfect
setting
for
the
quaintly
shaped
furniture
which
was
all
of
inlaid
with
ivory
on
a
small
table
of
carved
ivory
in
the
centre
of
the
room
lay
a
bunch
of
madonna
lilies
tied
with
a
finely
twisted
cord
of
gold
we
murmured
our
admiration
and
santoris
addressed
himself
directly
to
me
for
the
first
time
since
we
had
come
on
board
will
you
go
in
and
rest
for
a
while
till
luncheon
he
said
i
placed
the
lilies
there
for
your
acceptance
the
colour
rushed
to
my
cheeks
i
looked
up
at
him
in
a
little
wonderment
but
i
am
not
a
princess
his
eyes
smiled
down
into
mine
no
then
i
must
have
dreamed
you
were
my
heart
gave
a
quick
throb
some
memory
touched
my
brain
but
what
it
was
i
could
not
tell
harland
glanced
at
me
and
laughed
what
did
i
tell
you
the
other
day
he
said
did
i
not
call
you
the
princess
of
a
fairy
tale
i
was
not
far
wrong
they
left
me
to
myself
then
and
as
i
stood
alone
in
the
beautiful
room
which
had
thus
been
placed
at
my
disposal
a
curious
feeling
came
over
me
that
these
luxurious
surroundings
were
after
all
not
new
to
my
experience
i
had
been
accustomed
to
them
for
a
great
part
of
my
life
stay
how
foolish
of
me
great
part
of
my
life
then
what
part
of
it
i
briefly
reviewed
my
own
career
a
difficult
and
solitary
childhood
the
hard
and
uphill
work
which
became
my
lot
as
soon
as
i
was
old
enough
to
work
at
all
incessant
study
and
certainly
no
surplus
of
riches
then
where
had
i
known
luxury
i
sank
into
a
chair
dreamily
considering
the
floating
scent
of
and
the
perfume
of
lilies
commingled
was
like
the
breath
of
an
odorous
garden
in
the
east
familiar
to
me
long
ago
and
as
i
sat
musing
i
became
conscious
of
a
sudden
inrush
of
power
and
sense
of
dominance
which
lifted
me
as
it
were
above
myself
as
though
i
had
without
any
warning
been
given
the
full
control
of
a
great
kingdom
and
its
people
catching
sight
of
my
own
reflection
in
an
opposite
mirror
i
was
startled
and
almost
afraid
at
the
expression
of
my
face
the
proud
light
in
my
eyes
the
smile
on
my
lips
what
am
i
thinking
of
i
said
half
aloud
i
am
not
my
true
self
some
remnant
of
a
pride
has
arisen
in
me
and
made
me
less
of
a
humble
student
i
must
not
yield
to
this
overpowering
demand
on
my
soul
it
is
surely
an
evil
suggestion
which
asserts
itself
like
the
warning
pain
or
fever
of
an
impending
disease
can
it
be
the
influence
of
santoris
no
i
will
never
believe
it
and
yet
a
vague
uneasiness
beset
me
and
i
rose
and
paced
about
restlessly
then
pausing
where
the
lovely
madonna
lilies
lay
on
the
ivory
table
i
remembered
they
had
been
put
there
for
me
i
raised
them
gently
inhaling
their
delicious
fragrance
and
as
i
did
so
saw
lying
immediately
underneath
them
a
golden
cross
of
a
mystic
shape
i
knew
well
its
upper
half
set
on
the
face
of
a
star
also
of
gold
with
joy
i
took
it
up
and
kissed
it
reverently
and
as
i
compared
it
with
the
one
i
always
secretly
wore
on
my
own
person
i
knew
that
all
was
well
and
that
i
need
have
no
distrust
of
rafel
santoris
no
injurious
effect
on
my
mind
could
possibly
be
exerted
by
his
influence
and
i
was
thrown
back
on
myself
for
a
clue
to
that
singular
wave
of
feeling
so
entirely
contrary
to
my
own
disposition
which
had
for
a
moment
overwhelmed
me
i
could
not
trace
its
source
but
i
speedily
conquered
it
fastening
one
of
the
snowy
lilies
in
my
waistband
as
a
contrast
to
the
bright
bit
of
which
i
cherished
even
more
than
if
it
were
a
jewel
i
presently
went
up
on
deck
where
i
found
my
host
harland
captain
derrick
and
marino
fazio
all
talking
animatedly
together
the
mystery
is
cleared
up
said
harland
addressing
me
as
i
approached
captain
derrick
is
satisfied
he
has
learned
how
one
of
the
finest
schooners
he
has
ever
seen
can
make
full
speed
in
any
weather
without
wind
oh
no
i
have
learned
how
to
do
it
i
a
long
way
off
that
said
derrick
but
i
seen
how
it
done
and
it
marvellous
if
that
invention
could
be
applied
to
all
ships
ah
but
first
of
all
it
would
be
necessary
to
instruct
the
shipbuilders
put
in
fazio
they
would
have
to
learn
their
trade
all
over
again
our
yacht
looks
as
though
she
were
built
on
the
same
lines
as
all
yachts
but
you
know
you
have
seen
she
is
entirely
different
captain
derrick
gave
a
nod
of
grave
emphasis
santoris
meantime
had
come
to
my
side
our
glances
met
he
saw
that
i
had
received
and
understood
the
message
of
the
lilies
and
a
light
and
colour
came
into
his
eyes
that
made
them
beautiful
men
have
not
yet
fully
enjoyed
their
heritage
he
said
taking
up
the
conversation
our
yacht
motive
power
seems
complex
but
in
reality
it
is
very
simple
and
the
same
force
which
propels
this
light
vessel
would
propel
the
biggest
liner
afloat
nature
has
given
us
all
the
materials
for
every
kind
of
work
and
progress
physical
and
mental
but
because
we
do
not
at
once
comprehend
them
we
deny
their
uses
nothing
in
the
air
earth
or
water
exists
which
we
may
not
press
into
our
service
and
it
is
in
the
study
of
natural
forces
that
we
find
our
conquest
what
hundreds
of
years
it
took
us
to
discover
the
wonders
of
steam
how
the
discoverer
was
mocked
and
laughed
at
yet
it
was
not
really
it
was
always
there
waiting
to
be
employed
and
wasted
by
mere
lack
of
human
effort
one
can
say
the
same
of
electricity
sometimes
called
it
is
no
miracle
but
perfectly
common
and
natural
only
we
have
until
now
failed
to
apply
it
to
our
needs
and
even
when
wider
disclosures
of
science
are
being
made
to
us
every
day
we
still
bar
knowledge
by
obstinacy
and
remain
in
ignorance
rather
than
learn
a
few
grains
in
weight
of
hydrogen
have
power
enough
to
raise
a
million
tons
to
a
height
of
more
than
three
hundred
feet
and
if
we
could
only
find
a
way
to
liberate
economically
and
with
discretion
the
various
forces
which
spirit
and
matter
contain
we
might
change
the
whole
occupation
of
man
and
make
of
him
less
a
labourer
than
thinker
less
mortal
than
angel
the
wildest
might
come
true
and
earth
be
transformed
into
a
paradise
and
as
for
motive
power
in
a
thimbleful
of
concentrated
fuel
we
might
take
the
largest
ship
across
the
widest
ocean
i
say
if
we
could
only
find
a
way
some
think
they
are
finding
it
you
for
example
suggested
harland
he
laughed
i
if
you
like
for
example
will
you
come
to
luncheon
he
led
the
way
and
harland
and
i
followed
captain
derrick
who
i
saw
was
a
little
afraid
of
him
had
arranged
to
take
his
luncheon
with
fazio
and
the
other
officers
of
the
crew
apart
we
were
waited
upon
by
men
attired
in
the
picturesque
costume
of
the
east
who
performed
their
duties
with
noiseless
grace
and
swiftness
the
yacht
had
for
some
time
slackened
speed
and
appeared
to
be
merely
floating
lazily
on
the
surface
of
the
calm
water
we
were
told
she
could
always
do
this
and
make
almost
imperceptible
headway
provided
there
was
no
impending
storm
in
the
air
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
scarcely
moving
and
the
whole
atmosphere
surrounding
us
expressed
the
most
delicious
tranquillity
the
luncheon
prepared
for
us
was
of
the
daintiest
and
most
elegant
description
and
harland
who
on
account
of
his
seldom
had
any
appetite
enjoyed
it
with
a
zest
and
heartiness
i
had
never
seen
him
display
before
he
particularly
appreciated
the
wine
a
rich
beverage
which
was
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
tasted
there
is
nothing
remarkable
about
it
said
santoris
i
when
questioned
as
to
its
origin
it
is
simply
real
wine
though
you
may
say
that
of
itself
is
remarkable
there
being
none
in
the
market
it
is
the
pure
juice
of
the
grape
prepared
in
such
a
manner
as
to
nourish
the
blood
without
inflaming
it
it
can
do
you
no
harm
in
fact
for
you
harland
it
is
an
excellent
thing
why
for
me
in
particular
queried
harland
rather
sharply
because
you
need
it
answered
santoris
my
dear
fellow
you
are
not
in
the
best
of
health
and
you
will
never
get
better
under
your
present
treatment
i
looked
up
eagerly
that
is
what
i
too
have
thought
i
said
only
i
dared
not
express
it
harland
surveyed
me
with
an
amused
smile
dared
not
i
know
nothing
you
would
not
dare
but
with
all
your
boldness
you
are
full
of
mere
theories
and
theories
never
made
an
ill
man
well
yet
santoris
exchanged
a
swift
glance
with
me
then
he
spoke
theory
without
practice
is
of
course
useless
he
said
but
surely
you
can
see
that
this
lady
has
reached
a
certain
plane
of
thought
on
which
she
herself
dwells
in
health
and
content
and
can
she
not
serve
you
as
an
object
lesson
not
at
all
replied
harland
almost
testily
she
is
a
woman
whose
life
has
been
immersed
in
study
and
contemplation
and
because
she
has
allowed
herself
to
forego
many
of
the
world
pleasures
she
can
be
made
happy
by
a
mere
nothing
a
handful
of
roses
or
the
sound
of
sweet
music
are
they
interrupted
santoris
to
business
men
they
are
and
business
itself
is
it
not
also
from
some
points
of
view
a
santoris
if
you
are
going
to
be
i
will
have
none
of
you
said
harland
with
a
vexed
laugh
what
i
wish
to
say
is
merely
this
that
my
little
friend
here
for
whom
i
have
a
great
esteem
let
me
assure
her
is
not
really
capable
of
forming
an
opinion
of
the
condition
of
a
man
like
myself
nor
can
she
judge
of
the
treatment
likely
to
benefit
me
she
does
not
even
know
the
nature
of
my
illness
but
i
can
see
that
she
has
taken
a
dislike
to
my
physician
brayle
i
never
dislikes
harland
i
interrupted
quickly
i
merely
trust
to
a
guiding
instinct
which
tells
me
when
a
man
is
sincere
or
when
he
is
acting
a
part
that
all
well
you
decided
that
brayle
is
not
sincere
he
replied
and
you
hardly
think
him
clever
but
if
you
would
consider
the
point
logically
you
might
enquire
what
motive
could
he
possibly
have
for
playing
the
humbug
with
me
santoris
smiled
oh
man
of
you
can
ask
that
we
were
at
the
end
of
luncheon
the
servants
had
retired
and
harland
was
sipping
his
coffee
and
smoking
a
cigar
you
can
ask
that
he
repeated
you
a
millionaire
with
one
daughter
who
is
your
sole
heiress
can
ask
what
motive
a
man
like
brayle
worldly
calculating
and
without
heart
has
in
keeping
you
both
both
i
say
you
and
your
daughter
equally
in
his
medical
clutches
harland
sharp
eyes
flashed
with
a
sudden
menace
if
i
thought
he
began
then
he
broke
off
presently
he
resumed
you
are
not
aware
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
santoris
wizard
and
scientist
as
you
are
you
can
not
know
everything
i
need
constant
medical
attendance
and
my
disease
is
incurable
no
said
santoris
quietly
not
incurable
a
sudden
hope
illumined
harland
worn
and
haggard
face
not
incurable
but
my
good
fellow
you
do
even
know
what
it
is
i
do
i
also
know
how
it
began
and
when
how
it
has
progressed
and
how
it
will
end
i
know
too
how
it
can
be
checked
cut
off
in
its
development
and
utterly
destroyed
but
the
cure
would
depend
on
yourself
more
than
on
brayle
or
any
other
physician
at
present
no
good
is
being
done
and
much
harm
for
instance
you
are
in
pain
now
i
am
but
how
can
you
tell
by
the
small
almost
imperceptible
lines
on
your
face
which
contract
quite
unconsciously
to
yourself
i
can
stop
that
dreary
suffering
at
once
for
you
if
you
will
let
me
oh
i
will
you
certainly
and
harland
smiled
incredulously
but
i
think
you
your
abilities
i
was
never
a
boaster
replied
santoris
cheerfully
but
you
shall
keep
whatever
opinion
you
like
of
me
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
tiny
crystal
phial
set
in
a
sheath
of
gold
a
touch
of
this
in
your
glass
of
wine
will
make
you
feel
a
new
man
we
watched
him
with
strained
attention
as
he
carefully
allowed
two
small
drops
of
liquid
bright
and
clear
as
dew
to
fall
one
after
the
other
into
harland
glass
now
he
continued
drink
without
fear
and
say
to
all
pain
for
at
least
hours
with
a
docility
quite
unusual
to
him
harland
obeyed
may
i
go
on
smoking
he
asked
you
may
a
minute
passed
and
harland
face
expressed
a
sudden
surprise
and
relief
well
what
now
asked
santoris
how
is
the
pain
gone
he
answered
i
can
hardly
believe
it
but
i
bound
to
admit
it
that
right
and
it
will
not
come
back
not
at
any
rate
nor
shall
we
go
on
deck
now
we
assented
as
we
left
the
saloon
he
said
you
must
see
the
glow
of
the
sunset
over
loch
coruisk
it
always
a
fine
sight
and
it
promises
to
be
specially
fine
this
evening
there
are
so
many
picturesque
clouds
floating
about
we
are
turning
back
to
loch
scavaig
and
when
we
get
there
we
can
land
and
do
the
rest
of
the
excursion
on
foot
it
not
much
of
a
climb
will
you
feel
equal
to
it
this
question
he
put
to
me
personally
i
smiled
of
course
i
feel
equal
to
anything
besides
i
been
very
lazy
on
board
the
taking
no
real
exercise
a
walk
will
do
me
good
harland
seated
himself
in
one
of
the
long
reclining
chairs
which
were
placed
temptingly
under
an
awning
on
deck
his
eyes
were
clearer
and
his
face
more
composed
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
those
drops
you
gave
me
are
magical
santoris
he
said
i
wish
you
let
me
have
a
supply
santoris
stood
looking
down
upon
him
kindly
it
would
not
be
safe
for
you
he
answered
the
remedy
is
a
sovereign
one
if
used
very
rarely
and
with
extreme
caution
but
in
uninstructed
hands
it
is
dangerous
its
work
is
to
stimulate
certain
cells
at
the
same
time
like
all
things
taken
in
excess
it
can
destroy
them
moreover
it
would
not
agree
with
brayle
medicines
you
really
and
truly
think
brayle
an
impostor
impostor
is
a
strong
word
no
i
will
give
him
credit
for
believing
in
himself
up
to
a
certain
point
but
of
course
he
knows
that
the
treatment
he
is
giving
to
your
daughter
is
perfectly
worthless
just
as
he
knows
that
she
is
not
really
not
really
ill
harland
almost
bounced
up
in
his
chair
while
i
felt
a
secret
thrill
of
satisfaction
why
she
been
a
miserable
querulous
invalid
for
years
since
she
broke
off
her
engagement
to
a
worthless
rascal
said
santoris
calmly
you
see
i
know
all
about
it
i
listened
astonished
how
did
he
know
how
could
he
know
the
intimate
details
of
a
life
like
catherine
which
could
scarcely
be
of
interest
to
a
man
such
as
he
was
your
daughter
trouble
is
written
on
her
face
he
went
on
warped
affections
slain
desires
disappointed
hopes
and
neither
the
strength
nor
the
will
to
turn
these
troubles
to
blessings
therefore
they
resemble
an
army
of
malarious
germs
which
are
eating
away
her
moral
fibre
brayle
knows
that
what
she
needs
is
the
belief
that
someone
has
an
interest
not
only
in
her
but
in
the
particularly
morbid
view
she
has
taught
herself
to
take
of
life
he
is
actively
showing
that
interest
the
rest
is
easy
and
will
be
easier
when
well
when
you
are
gone
harland
was
silent
drawing
slow
whiffs
from
his
cigar
after
a
long
pause
he
said
you
are
prejudiced
and
i
think
you
are
mistaken
you
only
saw
the
man
for
a
few
minutes
last
night
and
you
know
nothing
of
him
nothing
except
what
he
is
bound
to
reveal
answered
santoris
what
do
you
mean
you
will
not
believe
me
if
i
tell
you
and
santoris
drawing
a
chair
close
to
mine
sat
down
yet
i
am
sure
this
lady
who
is
your
friend
and
guest
will
corroborate
what
i
say
though
of
course
you
will
not
believe
her
in
fact
my
dear
harland
as
you
have
schooled
yourself
to
believe
nothing
why
urge
me
to
point
out
a
truth
you
decline
to
accept
had
you
lived
in
the
time
of
galileo
you
would
have
been
one
of
his
torturers
i
ask
you
to
explain
said
harland
with
a
touch
of
pique
whether
i
accept
your
explanation
or
not
is
my
own
affair
quite
agreed
santoris
with
a
slight
smile
as
i
told
you
long
ago
at
oxford
a
man
life
is
his
own
affair
entirely
he
can
do
what
he
likes
with
it
but
he
can
no
more
command
the
result
of
what
he
does
with
it
than
the
sun
can
conceal
its
rays
each
individual
human
being
male
and
female
alike
moves
unconsciously
in
the
light
of
as
though
all
his
or
her
faults
and
virtues
were
reflected
like
the
colours
in
a
prism
or
were
set
out
in
a
window
for
to
gaze
upon
fortunately
for
the
general
peace
of
society
however
most
are
not
gifted
with
the
sight
to
see
the
involuntary
display
you
speak
in
enigmas
said
harland
impatiently
and
i
not
good
at
guessing
them
santoris
regarded
him
fixedly
his
eyes
were
luminous
and
compassionate
the
simplest
truths
are
to
you
he
said
regretfully
a
pity
it
is
so
you
ask
me
what
i
mean
when
i
say
a
man
is
to
reveal
himself
the
process
of
accompanies
as
much
as
the
fragrance
of
a
rose
accompanies
its
opening
petals
you
can
never
detach
yourself
from
your
own
enveloping
aura
neither
in
body
nor
in
soul
christ
taught
this
when
he
said
your
light
so
shine
before
men
that
they
may
see
your
good
works
and
glorify
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
your
remember
that
word
is
not
used
here
as
a
figure
of
speech
but
as
a
statement
of
fact
a
positive
surrounds
you
it
is
exhaled
and
produced
by
your
physical
and
moral
being
and
those
among
us
who
have
cultivated
their
inner
organs
of
vision
see
it
before
they
see
you
it
can
be
of
the
purest
radiance
equally
it
can
be
a
mere
nebulous
film
but
whatever
the
moral
and
physical
condition
of
the
man
or
woman
concerned
it
is
always
shown
in
the
aura
which
each
separate
individual
expresses
for
himself
or
herself
in
this
way
brayle
reveals
his
nature
to
me
as
well
as
the
chief
tendency
of
his
thoughts
in
this
way
you
reveal
yourself
and
your
present
state
of
health
it
is
a
proved
test
that
can
not
go
wrong
harland
listened
with
his
usual
air
of
cynical
tolerance
and
incredulity
i
have
heard
this
sort
of
nonsense
before
he
said
i
have
even
read
in
otherwise
reliable
scientific
journals
about
the
of
people
affecting
us
with
antipathies
or
sympathies
for
or
against
them
but
it
a
merely
fanciful
suggestion
and
has
no
foundation
in
reality
why
did
you
wish
me
to
explain
then
asked
santoris
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
know
and
what
i
see
harland
moved
restlessly
holding
his
cigar
between
his
fingers
and
looking
at
it
curiously
to
avoid
as
i
thought
the
steadfast
brilliancy
of
the
compelling
eyes
that
were
fixed
upon
him
these
he
went
on
indifferently
are
nothing
but
suppositions
i
grant
you
that
certain
discoveries
are
being
made
concerning
the
luminosity
of
trees
and
plants
which
in
some
states
of
the
atmosphere
give
out
rays
of
light
but
that
human
beings
do
the
same
i
decline
to
believe
of
course
and
santoris
leaned
back
in
his
chair
easily
as
though
at
once
dismissing
the
subject
from
his
mind
a
man
born
blind
must
needs
decline
to
believe
in
the
pleasures
of
sight
harland
wrinkled
brow
deepened
its
furrows
in
a
frown
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
do
you
dare
to
tell
me
he
said
that
you
see
any
as
you
call
it
round
my
personality
i
do
most
assuredly
answered
santoris
i
see
it
as
distinctly
as
i
see
yourself
in
the
midst
of
it
but
there
is
no
actual
light
in
it
it
is
mere
grey
mist
a
mist
of
miasma
thank
you
and
harland
laughed
harshly
you
are
complimentary
is
it
a
time
for
compliments
asked
santoris
with
sudden
sternness
harland
would
you
have
me
tell
you
all
harland
face
grew
livid
he
threw
up
his
hand
with
a
warning
gesture
no
he
said
almost
violently
he
clutched
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
a
nervous
grip
and
for
one
instant
looked
like
a
hunted
creature
caught
in
some
act
of
crime
recovering
himself
quickly
he
forced
a
smile
what
about
our
little
friend
queried
glancing
at
me
does
she
herself
in
radiance
santoris
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
then
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
me
almost
wistfully
she
does
he
answered
i
wish
you
could
see
her
as
i
see
her
there
was
a
moment
silence
my
face
grew
warm
and
i
was
vaguely
embarrassed
but
i
met
his
gaze
fully
and
frankly
and
wish
i
could
see
myself
as
you
see
me
i
said
half
laughingly
for
i
am
not
in
the
least
aware
of
my
own
aura
it
is
not
intended
that
anyone
should
be
visibly
aware
of
it
in
their
own
personality
he
answered
but
i
think
it
is
right
we
should
realise
the
existence
of
these
radiant
or
cloudy
exhalations
which
we
ourselves
weave
around
ourselves
so
that
we
may
in
the
light
as
children
of
the
light
his
voice
sank
to
a
grave
and
tender
tone
which
checked
harland
in
something
he
was
evidently
about
to
say
for
he
bit
his
lip
and
was
silent
i
rose
from
my
chair
and
moved
away
then
looking
from
the
smooth
deck
of
the
shadowed
by
her
full
white
sails
out
to
the
peaks
of
the
majestic
hills
whose
picturesque
beauties
are
sung
in
the
wild
strains
of
ossian
and
the
projecting
crags
deep
hollows
and
lofty
pinnacles
outlining
the
coast
with
its
numerous
waterfalls
lochs
and
shadowy
creeks
a
thin
and
delicate
haze
of
mist
hung
over
the
land
like
a
pale
violet
veil
through
which
the
sun
shot
beams
of
rose
and
gold
giving
a
vaporous
unsubstantial
effect
to
the
scenery
as
though
it
were
gliding
with
us
like
a
cloud
pageant
on
the
surface
of
the
calm
water
the
shores
of
loch
scavaig
began
to
be
dimly
seen
in
the
distance
and
presently
captain
derrick
approached
harland
in
hand
the
must
have
gone
for
a
cruise
he
said
in
rather
a
perturbed
way
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
there
no
sign
of
her
where
we
left
her
this
morning
harland
heard
this
indifferently
perhaps
catherine
wished
for
a
sail
he
answered
there
are
plenty
on
board
to
manage
the
vessel
you
not
anxious
oh
not
at
all
sir
if
you
are
satisfied
derrick
answered
harland
stretched
himself
luxuriously
in
his
chair
personally
i
do
mind
where
the
has
gone
to
for
the
moment
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
particularly
comfortable
where
i
am
santoris
here
and
santoris
who
had
stepped
aside
to
give
some
order
to
one
of
his
men
came
up
at
the
call
what
do
you
say
to
leaving
me
on
board
while
you
and
my
little
friend
go
and
see
your
sunset
effect
on
loch
coruisk
by
yourselves
santoris
heard
this
suggestion
with
an
amused
look
you
do
care
for
sunsets
oh
yes
i
do
in
a
way
but
i
seen
so
many
of
them
no
two
alike
put
in
santoris
i
daresay
not
still
i
do
mind
missing
a
few
just
now
i
should
like
a
sound
sleep
rather
than
a
sunset
it
very
unsociable
i
know
but
here
he
half
closed
his
eyes
and
seemed
inclined
to
doze
off
there
and
then
santoris
turned
to
me
what
do
you
say
can
you
put
up
with
my
company
for
an
hour
or
two
and
allow
me
to
be
your
guide
to
loch
coruisk
or
would
you
too
rather
not
see
the
sunset
our
eyes
met
a
thrill
of
mingled
joy
and
fear
ran
through
me
and
again
i
felt
that
strange
sense
of
power
and
dominance
which
had
previously
overwhelmed
me
indeed
i
have
set
my
heart
on
going
to
loch
coruisk
i
answered
lightly
and
i
can
not
let
you
off
your
promise
to
take
me
there
we
will
leave
harland
to
his
siesta
you
sure
you
do
not
mind
said
harland
then
opening
his
eyes
drowsily
you
will
be
perfectly
safe
with
santoris
i
smiled
i
did
not
need
that
assurance
and
i
talked
gaily
with
captain
derrick
on
the
subject
of
the
and
the
course
of
her
possible
cruise
while
he
scanned
the
waters
in
search
of
her
and
i
watched
with
growing
impatience
our
gradual
approach
to
loch
scavaig
which
in
the
bright
afternoon
looked
scarcely
less
dreary
than
at
night
especially
now
that
the
was
no
longer
there
to
give
some
air
of
human
occupation
to
the
wild
and
barren
surroundings
the
sun
was
well
inclined
towards
the
western
horizon
when
the
reached
her
former
moorings
and
noiselessly
dropped
anchor
and
about
twenty
minutes
later
the
electric
launch
belonging
to
the
vessel
was
lowered
and
i
entered
it
with
santoris
a
couple
of
his
men
managing
the
boat
as
it
rushed
through
the
dark
water
to
the
shore
viii
visions
the
touch
of
the
earth
seemed
strange
to
me
after
nearly
a
week
spent
at
sea
and
as
i
sprang
from
the
launch
on
to
the
rough
rocks
aided
by
santoris
i
was
for
a
moment
faint
and
giddy
the
dark
mountain
summits
seemed
to
swirl
round
me
and
the
glittering
water
shining
like
steel
had
the
weird
effect
of
a
great
mirror
in
which
a
fluttering
vision
of
something
undefined
and
undeclared
rose
and
passed
like
a
breath
i
recovered
myself
with
an
effort
and
stood
still
trying
to
control
the
foolish
throbbing
of
my
heart
while
my
companion
gave
a
few
orders
to
his
men
in
a
language
which
i
thought
i
knew
though
i
could
not
follow
it
are
you
speaking
gaelic
i
asked
him
with
a
smile
no
only
something
very
like
it
phoenician
he
looked
straight
at
me
as
he
said
this
and
his
eyes
darkly
blue
and
brilliant
expressed
a
world
of
suggestion
he
went
on
all
this
country
was
familiar
ground
to
the
phoenician
colonists
of
ages
ago
i
am
sure
you
know
that
the
gaelic
tongue
is
the
genuine
dialect
of
the
ancient
phoenician
celtic
and
when
i
speak
the
original
language
to
a
highlander
who
only
knows
his
native
gaelic
he
understands
me
perfectly
i
was
silent
we
moved
away
from
the
shore
walking
slowly
side
by
side
presently
i
paused
looking
back
at
the
launch
we
had
just
left
your
men
are
not
highlanders
no
they
are
from
egypt
but
surely
i
said
with
some
hesitation
phoenician
is
no
longer
known
or
spoken
not
by
the
world
of
ordinary
men
he
answered
i
know
it
and
speak
it
and
so
do
most
of
those
who
serve
me
you
have
heard
it
before
only
you
do
not
quite
remember
i
looked
at
him
startled
he
smiled
adding
gently
nothing
dies
not
even
a
language
we
were
not
yet
out
of
sight
of
the
men
they
had
pushed
the
launch
off
shore
again
and
were
starting
it
back
to
the
yacht
it
being
arranged
that
they
should
return
for
us
in
a
couple
of
hours
we
were
following
a
path
among
slippery
stones
near
a
rushing
torrent
but
as
we
turned
round
a
sharp
bend
we
lost
the
view
of
loch
scavaig
itself
and
were
for
the
first
time
truly
alone
huge
mountains
crowned
with
jagged
pinnacles
surrounded
us
on
all
sides
here
and
there
tufts
of
heather
clinging
to
large
masses
of
dark
stone
blazed
in
the
declining
sunshine
the
hollow
sound
of
the
falling
stream
made
a
perpetual
crooning
music
in
our
ears
and
the
warm
stirless
air
seemed
breathless
as
though
hung
in
suspense
above
us
waiting
for
the
echo
of
some
word
or
whisper
that
should
betray
a
life
secret
such
a
silence
held
us
that
it
was
almost
unbearable
every
nerve
in
my
body
seemed
like
a
strained
ready
to
snap
at
a
touch
and
yet
i
could
not
speak
i
tried
to
get
the
mastery
over
the
rising
tide
of
thought
memory
and
emotion
that
surged
in
my
soul
like
a
tempest
swiftly
and
peremptorily
i
argued
with
myself
that
the
extraordinary
chaos
of
my
mind
was
only
due
to
my
own
imaginings
nevertheless
despite
my
struggles
i
remained
caught
as
it
were
in
a
web
that
imprisoned
every
faculty
and
sense
a
web
fine
as
gossamer
yet
unbreakable
as
iron
in
a
kind
of
desperation
i
raised
my
eyes
burning
with
the
heat
of
restrained
tears
and
saw
santoris
watching
me
with
patient
almost
appealing
tenderness
i
felt
that
he
could
read
my
unexpressed
trouble
and
involuntarily
i
stretched
out
my
hands
to
him
tell
me
i
half
what
is
it
i
must
know
we
are
strangers
and
yet
he
caught
my
hands
in
his
own
not
strangers
he
said
his
voice
trembling
a
little
you
can
not
say
that
not
strangers
but
old
friends
the
strong
gentleness
of
his
clasp
recalled
the
warm
pressure
of
the
invisible
hands
that
had
guided
me
out
of
darkness
in
my
dream
of
a
few
nights
past
i
looked
up
into
his
face
and
every
line
of
it
became
suddenly
startlingly
familiar
the
blue
eyes
the
broad
brows
and
intellectual
features
were
all
as
well
known
to
me
as
might
be
the
portrait
of
a
beloved
one
to
the
lover
and
my
heart
almost
stood
still
with
the
wonder
and
terror
of
the
recognition
not
strangers
he
repeated
with
quiet
emphasis
as
though
to
reassure
me
only
since
we
last
met
we
have
travelled
far
asunder
have
yet
a
little
patience
you
will
presently
remember
me
as
well
as
i
remember
you
with
the
rush
of
startled
recollection
i
found
my
voice
i
remember
you
now
i
said
in
low
unsteady
tones
i
have
seen
you
often
often
but
where
tell
me
where
oh
surely
you
know
he
still
held
my
hands
with
the
tenderest
force
and
seemed
like
myself
to
find
speech
difficult
if
two
deeply
attached
friends
parted
for
many
years
were
all
unexpectedly
to
meet
in
some
solitary
place
where
neither
had
thought
to
see
a
living
soul
their
emotion
could
hardly
be
keener
than
ours
and
yet
there
was
an
invisible
barrier
between
us
a
barrier
erected
either
by
him
or
by
myself
something
that
held
us
apart
the
sudden
and
overpowering
demand
made
upon
our
strength
by
the
swift
and
subtle
attraction
which
drew
us
together
was
held
in
check
by
ourselves
and
it
was
as
if
we
were
each
separately
surrounded
by
a
circle
across
which
neither
of
us
dared
to
pass
i
looked
at
him
in
mingled
fear
and
questioning
his
eyes
were
gravely
thoughtful
and
full
of
light
yes
i
know
he
answered
at
last
speaking
very
softly
while
gently
releasing
one
of
my
hands
he
held
the
other
i
know
but
we
need
not
speak
of
that
as
i
have
already
said
you
will
remember
all
by
gradual
degrees
we
are
never
permitted
to
entirely
forget
but
it
is
quite
natural
that
now
at
this
immediate
hour
we
should
find
it
strange
you
perhaps
more
than
i
that
something
impels
us
one
to
the
other
something
that
will
not
be
gainsaid
something
that
if
all
the
powers
of
earth
and
heaven
could
intervene
which
by
simplest
law
they
can
not
will
take
no
denial
i
trembled
not
with
fear
but
with
an
exquisite
delight
i
dared
not
pause
to
analyse
he
pressed
my
hand
more
closely
we
had
better
walk
on
he
continued
averting
his
gaze
from
mine
for
the
moment
if
i
say
more
just
now
i
shall
say
too
much
and
you
will
be
frightened
perhaps
offended
i
have
been
guilty
of
so
many
errors
in
the
past
you
must
help
me
to
avoid
them
in
the
future
come
and
he
turned
his
eyes
again
upon
me
with
a
smile
let
us
see
the
sunset
we
moved
on
for
a
few
moments
in
absolute
silence
he
still
holding
my
hand
and
guiding
me
up
the
rough
path
we
followed
the
noise
of
the
rushing
torrent
sounded
louder
in
my
ears
sometimes
with
a
clattering
insistence
as
though
it
sought
to
match
itself
against
the
surging
of
my
own
quick
blood
in
an
endeavour
to
drown
my
thoughts
on
we
went
and
still
onward
the
path
seemed
interminable
though
it
was
in
reality
a
very
short
journey
but
there
was
such
a
weight
of
unutterable
things
pressing
on
my
soul
like
a
storm
craving
for
outlet
that
every
step
measured
itself
as
almost
a
mile
at
last
we
paused
we
were
in
full
view
of
loch
coruisk
and
its
weird
splendour
on
all
sides
arose
bare
and
lofty
mountains
broken
and
furrowed
here
and
there
by
deep
hollows
and
corries
supremely
grand
in
their
impressive
desolation
uplifting
their
stony
peaks
around
us
like
the
walls
and
turrets
of
a
gigantic
fortress
and
rising
so
abruptly
and
so
impenetrably
encompassing
the
black
stretch
of
water
below
that
it
seemed
impossible
for
a
sunbeam
to
force
its
shining
entrance
into
such
a
circle
of
dense
gloom
yet
there
was
a
shower
of
golden
light
pouring
aslant
down
one
of
the
highest
of
the
hills
brightening
to
vivid
crimson
stray
clumps
of
heather
touching
into
pale
green
some
patches
of
moss
and
lichen
and
giving
the
dazzling
flash
of
silver
to
the
white
wings
of
a
which
soared
above
our
heads
uttering
wild
cries
like
a
creature
in
pain
pale
blue
mists
were
rising
from
the
surface
of
the
lake
and
the
fitful
gusts
of
air
that
rushed
over
the
rocky
summits
played
with
these
impalpable
vapours
borne
inland
from
the
atlantic
and
tossed
them
to
and
fro
into
fantastic
shapes
some
like
flying
forms
with
long
hair
streaming
behind
them
some
like
armed
warriors
hurtling
their
spears
against
each
other
and
some
like
veiled
ghosts
hurrying
past
as
though
driven
to
their
land
of
shadows
by
shuddering
fear
we
stood
silently
hand
in
hand
watching
the
uneasy
flitting
of
these
cloud
phantoms
and
waiting
for
the
deepening
glow
which
when
it
should
spread
upwards
from
the
rays
of
the
sinking
sun
would
transform
the
wild
dark
scene
to
one
of
almost
supernatural
splendour
suddenly
santoris
spoke
now
shall
i
tell
you
where
we
last
met
he
asked
very
gently
and
may
i
show
you
the
reasons
why
we
meet
again
i
lifted
my
eyes
to
his
my
heart
beat
with
suffocating
quickness
and
thoughts
were
in
my
brain
that
threatened
to
overwhelm
my
small
remaining
stock
of
and
make
of
me
nothing
but
a
creature
of
tears
and
passion
i
moved
my
lips
in
an
effort
to
speak
but
no
sound
came
from
them
do
not
be
afraid
he
continued
in
the
same
quiet
tone
it
is
true
that
we
must
be
careful
now
as
in
the
past
we
were
careless
but
perfect
comprehension
of
each
other
rests
with
ourselves
may
i
go
on
i
gave
a
mute
sign
of
assent
there
was
a
rough
craig
near
us
curiously
shaped
like
a
sort
of
throne
and
canopy
the
canopy
being
formed
by
a
thickly
overhanging
mass
of
rock
and
heather
and
here
he
made
me
sit
down
placing
himself
beside
me
from
this
point
we
commanded
a
view
of
the
head
of
the
lake
and
the
great
mountain
which
closes
and
dominates
it
and
which
now
began
to
be
illumined
with
a
strange
glow
of
orange
and
purple
while
a
thin
mist
moved
slowly
across
it
like
the
folds
of
a
ghostly
stage
curtain
preparing
to
rise
and
display
the
first
scene
of
some
great
drama
sometimes
he
then
said
it
happens
even
in
the
world
of
cold
and
artificial
convention
that
a
man
and
woman
are
brought
together
who
to
their
own
immediate
consciousness
have
had
no
previous
acquaintance
with
each
other
and
yet
with
the
lightest
touch
the
swiftest
glance
of
an
eye
a
million
vibrations
are
set
quivering
in
them
like
struck
by
the
hand
of
a
master
and
responding
each
to
each
in
throbbing
harmony
and
perfect
tune
they
do
not
know
how
it
happens
they
only
feel
it
is
then
nothing
i
repeat
this
with
emphasis
nothing
can
keep
them
apart
soul
rushes
to
soul
heart
leaps
to
heart
and
all
form
and
ceremony
custom
and
usage
crumble
into
dust
before
the
power
that
overwhelms
them
these
sudden
storms
of
etheric
vibration
occur
every
day
among
the
most
ordinary
surroundings
and
with
the
most
unlikely
persons
and
society
as
at
present
constituted
frowns
and
shakes
its
head
or
jeers
at
what
it
can
not
understand
calling
such
impetuosity
folly
or
worse
while
remaining
wilfully
blind
to
the
fact
that
in
its
strangest
aspect
it
is
nothing
but
the
assertion
of
an
eternal
law
moreover
it
is
a
law
that
can
not
be
set
aside
or
broken
with
impunity
just
as
the
one
point
of
vibration
sympathetically
strikes
the
other
in
the
system
of
wireless
telegraphy
so
despite
millions
and
millions
of
intervening
currents
and
lines
of
divergence
the
immortal
strikes
its
kindred
fire
across
a
waste
of
worlds
until
they
meet
in
the
compelling
flash
of
that
god
message
called
love
he
paused
then
went
on
slowly
no
force
can
turn
aside
one
from
the
other
nothing
can
intervene
not
because
it
is
either
romance
or
reality
but
simply
because
it
is
a
law
you
understand
i
bent
my
head
silently
it
may
be
thousands
of
years
before
such
a
meeting
is
consummated
he
continued
for
thousands
of
years
are
but
hours
in
the
eternal
countings
yet
in
those
thousands
of
years
what
lives
must
be
lived
what
lessons
must
be
learned
what
sins
committed
and
expiated
what
precious
time
lost
or
found
what
happiness
missed
or
wasted
his
voice
thrilled
and
again
he
took
my
hand
and
held
it
gently
clasped
you
must
believe
in
yourself
alone
he
said
if
any
lurking
thought
suggests
a
disbelief
in
me
it
is
quite
natural
that
you
should
doubt
me
a
little
you
have
studied
long
and
deeply
you
have
worked
hard
at
problems
which
puzzle
the
strongest
man
brain
and
you
have
succeeded
in
many
things
because
you
have
kept
what
most
men
manage
to
lose
when
grappling
with
science
faith
you
have
always
studied
with
an
uplifted
heart
uplifted
towards
the
things
unseen
and
eternal
but
it
has
been
a
lonely
heart
too
as
lonely
as
mine
a
moment
silence
followed
a
silence
that
seemed
heavy
and
dark
like
a
passing
cloud
and
instinctively
i
looked
up
to
see
if
indeed
a
brooding
storm
was
not
above
us
a
heaven
of
splendid
colour
met
my
gaze
the
whole
sky
was
lighted
with
a
glory
of
gold
and
blue
but
below
this
flaming
radiance
there
was
a
motionless
mass
of
grey
vapour
hanging
square
as
it
seemed
across
the
face
of
the
lofty
mountain
at
the
head
of
the
lake
like
a
great
canvas
set
ready
for
an
pencil
and
prepared
to
receive
the
creation
of
his
thought
i
watched
this
in
a
kind
of
absorbed
fascination
conscious
that
the
warm
hand
holding
mine
had
strengthened
its
close
grasp
when
suddenly
something
sharp
and
brilliant
like
the
glitter
of
a
sword
or
a
forked
flash
of
lightning
passed
before
my
eyes
with
a
dizzying
sensation
and
the
lake
the
mountains
the
whole
landscape
vanished
like
a
fleeting
mirage
and
in
all
the
visible
air
only
the
heavy
curtain
of
mist
remained
i
made
an
effort
to
move
to
speak
in
vain
i
thought
some
sudden
illness
must
have
seized
me
yet
no
for
the
feeling
that
had
for
a
moment
unsteadied
my
nerves
had
already
passed
and
i
was
calm
enough
yet
i
saw
more
plainly
than
i
have
ever
seen
anything
in
visible
nature
a
slowly
moving
slowly
passing
panorama
of
scenes
and
episodes
that
presented
themselves
in
marvellous
outline
and
colouring
pictures
that
were
gradually
unrolled
and
spread
out
to
my
view
on
the
grey
background
of
that
impalpable
mist
which
like
a
shadow
hung
between
myself
and
impenetrable
mystery
and
i
realised
to
the
full
that
an
eternal
record
of
every
life
is
written
not
only
in
sound
but
in
light
in
colour
in
tune
in
mathematical
proportion
and
harmony
and
that
not
a
word
not
a
thought
not
an
action
is
forgotten
a
vast
forest
rose
before
me
i
saw
the
long
shadows
of
the
leafy
boughs
flung
thick
upon
the
sward
and
the
wild
tropical
vines
hanging
from
the
intertwisted
stems
a
golden
moon
looked
warmly
in
between
the
giant
branches
flooding
the
darkness
of
the
scene
with
rippling
radiance
and
within
its
light
two
human
beings
walked
a
man
and
woman
their
arms
round
each
other
their
faces
leaning
close
together
the
man
seemed
pleading
with
his
companion
for
some
favour
which
she
withheld
and
presently
she
drew
herself
away
from
him
altogether
with
a
decided
movement
of
haughty
rejection
i
could
not
see
her
face
but
her
attire
was
regal
and
splendid
and
on
her
head
there
shone
a
jewelled
diadem
her
lover
stood
apart
for
a
moment
with
bent
head
then
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
her
and
caught
her
hand
in
an
evident
outburst
of
passionate
entreaty
and
while
they
stood
thus
together
i
saw
the
figure
of
another
woman
moving
towards
them
she
came
directly
into
the
foreground
of
the
picture
her
white
garments
clinging
round
her
her
fair
hair
flung
loosely
over
her
shoulders
and
her
whole
demeanour
expressing
eagerness
and
fear
as
she
approached
the
man
sprang
up
from
his
knees
and
with
a
gesture
of
fury
drew
a
dagger
from
his
belt
and
plunged
it
into
her
heart
i
saw
her
reel
back
from
the
blow
i
saw
the
red
blood
well
up
through
the
whiteness
of
her
clothing
and
as
she
turned
towards
her
murderer
with
a
last
look
of
appeal
i
recognised
my
own
face
in
hers
and
in
his
the
face
of
santoris
i
uttered
a
cry
or
thought
i
uttered
it
a
darkness
swept
over
me
and
the
vision
vanished
another
vivid
flash
struck
my
eyes
and
i
found
myself
looking
upon
the
crowded
thoroughfares
of
a
great
city
towers
and
temples
palaces
and
bridges
presented
themselves
to
my
gaze
in
a
network
of
interminable
width
and
architectural
splendour
moving
and
swaying
before
me
like
a
wave
glittering
with
a
thousand
sparkles
uplifted
to
the
light
presently
this
unsteadiness
of
movement
resolved
itself
into
form
and
order
and
i
became
as
it
were
one
unobserved
spectator
among
thousands
of
a
scene
of
picturesque
magnificence
it
seemed
that
i
stood
in
the
enormous
audience
hall
of
a
great
palace
where
there
were
crowds
of
slaves
attendants
and
armed
men
on
all
sides
arose
huge
pillars
of
stone
on
which
were
carved
the
winged
heads
of
monsters
and
fabulous
gods
and
looming
out
of
the
shadows
i
saw
the
shapes
of
four
giant
sphinxes
which
guarded
a
throne
set
high
above
the
crowd
a
lambent
light
played
quiveringly
on
the
gorgeous
picture
growing
more
and
more
vivid
as
i
looked
and
throbbing
with
colour
and
motion
and
i
saw
that
on
the
throne
there
sat
a
woman
crowned
and
veiled
her
right
hand
held
a
sceptre
blazing
with
gold
and
gems
slaves
clad
in
costumes
of
the
richest
workmanship
and
design
abased
themselves
on
either
side
of
her
and
i
heard
the
clash
of
brazen
cymbals
and
music
as
the
crowd
of
people
surged
and
swayed
and
murmured
and
shouted
all
apparently
moved
by
some
special
excitement
or
interest
suddenly
i
perceived
the
object
on
which
the
general
attention
was
fixed
the
swooning
body
of
a
man
heavily
bound
in
chains
and
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
beside
him
stood
a
tall
black
slave
clad
in
vivid
scarlet
and
masked
this
creature
held
a
gleaming
dagger
uplifted
ready
to
strike
and
as
i
saw
this
a
wild
yearning
arose
in
me
to
save
the
threatened
life
of
the
bound
and
helpless
victim
if
i
could
only
rush
to
defend
and
drag
him
away
from
impending
peril
i
thought
but
no
i
was
forced
to
stand
helplessly
watching
the
scene
with
every
fibre
of
my
brain
burning
with
anguish
at
this
moment
the
crowned
and
veiled
woman
on
the
throne
suddenly
rose
and
stood
upright
with
a
commanding
gesture
she
stretched
out
her
glittering
sceptre
the
sign
was
given
swiftly
the
dagger
gleamed
through
the
air
and
struck
its
deadly
blow
straight
home
i
turned
away
my
eyes
in
shuddering
horror
but
was
compelled
by
some
invincible
power
to
raise
them
again
and
the
scene
before
me
glowed
red
as
with
the
hue
of
blood
i
saw
the
slain
victim
the
tumultuous
crowd
and
above
all
the
relentless
queen
who
with
one
movement
of
her
little
hand
had
swept
away
a
life
and
as
i
looked
upon
her
loathingly
she
threw
back
her
shrouding
golden
veil
my
own
face
looked
full
at
me
from
under
the
jewelled
arch
of
her
sparkling
diadem
ah
wicked
soul
i
wildly
cried
pitiless
queen
then
as
they
lifted
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
his
livid
countenance
was
turned
towards
me
and
i
saw
again
the
face
of
santoris
dumb
and
despairing
i
sank
as
it
were
within
myself
chilled
with
inexplicable
misery
and
i
heard
for
the
first
time
in
this
singular
pageant
of
vision
a
voice
slow
calm
and
thrilling
with
infinite
sadness
a
life
for
a
life
it
said
the
old
eternal
law
a
life
for
a
life
there
is
nothing
taken
which
shall
not
be
returned
again
nothing
lost
which
shall
not
be
found
a
life
for
a
life
then
came
silence
and
utter
darkness
slowly
brightening
slowly
widening
a
pale
radiance
like
the
earliest
glimmer
of
dawn
stole
gently
on
my
eyes
when
i
again
raised
them
i
saw
the
waving
curve
of
a
wide
sluggishly
flowing
river
and
near
it
a
temple
of
red
granite
stood
surrounded
with
shadowing
foliage
and
bright
clumps
of
flowers
huge
palms
lifted
their
fronded
heads
to
the
sky
and
on
the
edge
of
the
quiet
stream
there
loitered
a
group
of
girls
and
women
one
of
these
stood
apart
sad
and
alone
the
others
looking
at
her
with
something
of
pity
and
scorn
near
her
was
a
tall
upright
column
of
black
basalt
as
it
seemed
bearing
the
sculptured
head
of
a
god
the
features
were
calm
and
strong
and
reposeful
expressive
of
dignity
wisdom
and
power
and
as
i
looked
more
people
gathered
together
i
heard
strains
of
solemn
music
pealing
from
the
temple
close
by
and
i
saw
the
solitary
woman
draw
herself
farther
apart
and
almost
disappear
among
the
shadows
the
light
grew
brighter
in
the
east
the
sun
shot
a
few
advancing
rays
upward
suddenly
the
door
of
the
temple
was
thrown
open
and
a
long
procession
of
priests
carrying
flaming
tapers
and
attended
by
boys
in
white
garments
and
crowned
with
flowers
made
their
slow
and
stately
way
towards
the
column
with
the
head
upon
it
and
began
to
circle
round
it
chanting
as
they
walked
while
the
boys
swung
golden
censers
to
and
fro
impregnating
the
air
with
rich
perfume
the
people
all
knelt
and
still
the
priests
paced
round
and
round
chanting
and
murmuring
prayers
till
at
last
the
great
sun
lifted
the
edge
of
its
glowing
disc
above
the
horizon
and
its
rays
springing
from
the
east
like
golden
arrows
struck
the
brow
of
the
head
set
on
its
basalt
pedestal
with
the
sudden
glitter
of
this
morning
glory
the
chanting
ceased
the
procession
stopped
and
one
priest
tall
and
commanding
of
aspect
stepped
forth
from
the
rest
holding
up
his
hands
to
enjoin
silence
and
then
the
head
quivered
as
with
life
its
lips
moved
there
was
a
rippling
sound
like
the
chord
of
a
harp
smitten
by
the
wind
and
a
voice
full
sweet
and
resonant
spoke
aloud
the
words
i
face
the
sunrise
with
a
shout
of
joy
priests
and
people
responded
we
face
the
sunrise
and
he
who
seemed
the
highest
in
authority
raising
his
arms
invokingly
towards
heaven
exclaimed
even
so
o
mightiest
among
the
mighty
let
us
ever
remember
that
thy
shadow
is
but
part
of
thy
light
that
sorrow
is
but
the
passing
humour
of
joy
and
that
death
is
but
the
night
which
dawns
again
into
life
we
face
the
sunrise
then
all
who
were
assembled
joined
in
singing
a
strange
song
and
chorus
of
triumph
to
the
strains
of
which
they
slowly
moved
off
and
disappeared
like
shapes
breathed
on
a
mirror
and
melting
away
only
the
tall
high
priest
remained
and
he
stood
alone
waiting
as
it
were
for
something
eagerly
expected
and
desired
and
presently
the
woman
who
had
till
now
remained
hidden
among
the
shadows
of
the
surrounding
trees
came
swiftly
forward
she
was
very
pale
her
eyes
shone
with
tears
and
again
i
saw
my
own
face
in
hers
the
priest
turned
quickly
to
greet
her
and
i
distinctly
heard
every
word
he
spoke
as
he
caught
her
hands
in
his
own
and
drew
her
towards
him
everything
in
this
world
and
the
next
i
will
resign
he
said
for
love
of
thee
honour
dignity
and
this
poor
earth
renown
i
lay
at
thy
feet
thou
most
beloved
of
women
what
other
thing
created
or
imagined
can
be
compared
to
the
joy
of
thee
to
the
sweetness
of
thy
lips
the
softness
of
thy
bosom
the
love
that
trembles
into
confession
with
thy
smile
imprison
me
but
in
thine
arms
and
i
will
count
my
very
soul
well
lost
for
an
hour
of
love
with
thee
ah
deny
me
not
turn
me
not
away
from
thee
again
love
comes
but
once
in
life
such
love
as
ours
early
or
late
but
once
she
looked
at
him
with
tender
passion
and
pity
a
look
in
which
i
thankfully
saw
there
was
no
trace
of
pride
resentment
or
affected
injury
oh
my
beloved
she
answered
and
her
voice
plaintive
and
sweet
thrilled
on
the
silence
like
a
sob
of
pain
why
wilt
thou
rush
on
destruction
for
so
poor
a
thing
as
i
am
knowest
thou
not
and
wilt
thou
not
remember
that
to
a
priest
of
thy
great
order
the
love
of
woman
is
forbidden
and
the
punishment
thereof
is
death
already
the
people
view
thee
with
suspicion
and
me
with
scorn
forbear
o
dearest
bravest
soul
be
strong
strong
he
echoed
is
it
not
strong
to
love
ay
the
very
best
of
strength
for
what
avails
the
power
of
man
if
he
may
not
bend
a
woman
to
his
will
child
wherever
love
is
there
can
be
no
death
but
only
life
love
is
as
the
torrent
of
eternity
in
my
veins
the
pulse
of
everlasting
youth
and
victory
what
are
the
foolish
creeds
of
man
compared
with
this
one
truth
of
nature
love
is
not
the
deity
himself
the
supreme
lover
and
wouldst
thou
have
me
a
castaway
from
his
holiest
ordinance
ah
no
come
to
me
my
beloved
soul
of
my
soul
inmost
core
of
my
heart
come
to
me
in
the
silence
when
no
one
sees
and
no
one
hears
come
when
he
broke
off
checked
by
her
sudden
smile
and
look
of
rapture
some
thought
had
evidently
like
a
ray
of
light
cleared
her
doubts
away
so
be
it
she
said
i
give
thee
all
myself
from
henceforth
i
will
come
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
relief
and
joy
and
drew
her
closer
till
her
head
rested
on
his
breast
and
her
loosened
hair
fell
in
a
shower
across
his
arms
at
last
he
murmured
at
last
mine
all
mine
this
tender
soul
this
passionate
heart
mine
this
exquisite
life
to
do
with
as
i
will
o
crown
of
my
best
manhood
when
wilt
thou
come
to
me
she
answered
at
once
without
hesitation
she
said
when
the
moon
rises
meet
me
here
in
this
very
place
this
sacred
grove
where
memnon
hears
thy
vows
to
him
broken
and
my
vows
consecrated
to
thee
and
as
i
live
i
swear
i
will
be
all
thine
but
now
leave
me
to
pray
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
into
his
adoring
eyes
then
kissed
him
with
a
strange
grave
tenderness
as
though
bidding
him
farewell
and
with
a
gentle
gesture
motioned
him
away
elated
and
flushed
with
joy
he
obeyed
her
sign
and
left
her
disappearing
in
the
same
way
in
which
all
the
other
figures
in
this
weird
had
made
their
exit
she
watched
him
go
with
a
wistful
yearning
gaze
then
in
apparent
utter
desperation
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
the
impassive
head
on
its
rocky
pedestal
and
prayed
aloud
o
hidden
and
unknown
god
whom
we
poor
earthly
creatures
symbolise
give
me
the
strength
to
love
unselfishly
the
patience
to
endure
uncomplainingly
thou
heart
of
stone
temper
with
thy
coldest
wisdom
my
poor
throbbing
heart
of
flesh
help
me
to
quell
the
tempest
in
my
soul
and
let
me
be
even
as
thou
art
inflexible
immovable
save
when
the
sun
strikes
music
from
thy
dreaming
brows
and
tells
thee
it
is
day
forgive
o
great
god
forgive
the
fault
of
my
beloved
a
fault
which
is
not
his
but
mine
merely
because
i
live
and
he
hath
found
me
fair
let
all
be
well
for
him
but
for
me
let
nothing
evermore
be
either
well
or
ill
and
teach
me
even
me
to
face
the
sunrise
her
voice
ceased
a
mist
came
before
me
for
a
moment
and
when
this
cleared
the
same
scene
was
presented
to
me
under
the
glimmer
of
a
ghostly
moon
and
she
who
looked
so
like
myself
lay
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
great
statue
her
hands
clasped
on
her
breast
her
eyes
closed
her
mouth
smiling
as
in
sleep
while
beside
her
raved
and
wept
her
priestly
lover
invoking
her
by
every
tender
name
clasping
her
lifeless
body
in
his
arms
covering
her
face
with
useless
passionate
kisses
and
calling
her
back
with
wild
grief
from
the
silence
into
which
her
soul
had
fled
and
i
knew
then
that
she
had
put
all
thought
of
self
aside
in
a
sense
of
devotion
to
duty
she
had
chosen
what
she
imagined
to
be
the
only
way
out
of
difficulty
to
save
the
honour
of
her
lover
she
had
slain
herself
but
was
it
wise
or
foolish
this
thought
pressed
itself
insistently
home
to
my
mind
she
had
given
her
life
to
serve
a
mistaken
creed
she
had
bowed
to
the
conventions
of
a
temporary
code
of
human
law
yet
surely
god
was
above
all
strange
and
unnatural
systems
built
up
by
man
for
his
own
immediate
convenience
vanity
or
advantage
and
was
not
love
the
nearest
thing
to
god
and
if
those
two
souls
were
destined
lovers
could
they
be
divided
even
by
their
own
rashness
these
questions
were
curiously
urged
upon
my
inward
consciousness
as
i
looked
again
upon
the
poor
fragile
corpse
among
the
reeds
and
palms
of
the
sluggishly
flowing
river
and
heard
the
clamorous
despair
of
the
man
to
whom
she
might
have
been
joy
inspiration
and
victory
had
not
the
world
been
then
as
it
is
not
now
the
man
who
as
the
light
of
the
moonbeams
fell
upon
him
showed
me
in
his
haggard
and
miserable
features
the
spectral
likeness
of
santoris
was
it
right
i
asked
myself
that
the
two
perfect
lines
of
a
mutual
love
should
be
swept
asunder
or
if
it
was
as
some
might
conceive
it
right
according
to
certain
temporary
and
conventional
views
of
was
it
possible
to
so
sever
them
would
it
not
be
well
if
we
all
occasionally
remembered
that
there
is
an
eternal
law
of
harmony
between
souls
as
between
spheres
and
that
if
we
ourselves
bring
about
a
divergence
we
also
bring
about
discord
and
again
that
if
discord
results
by
our
it
is
against
the
law
and
must
by
the
working
of
natural
forces
be
resolved
into
concord
again
whether
such
resolvance
take
ten
a
hundred
a
thousand
or
ten
thousand
years
of
what
use
then
is
the
struggle
we
are
for
ever
making
in
our
narrow
and
limited
daily
lives
to
resist
the
wise
and
holy
teaching
of
nature
is
it
not
best
to
yield
to
the
insistence
of
the
music
of
life
while
it
sounds
in
our
ears
for
everything
must
come
round
to
way
in
the
end
her
way
being
god
way
and
god
way
the
only
way
so
i
thought
as
in
fashion
i
watched
the
vision
of
the
dead
woman
and
her
despairing
lover
fade
into
the
impenetrable
shadows
of
mystery
veiling
the
record
of
the
light
beyond
presently
i
became
conscious
of
a
deep
murmuring
sound
tike
the
subdued
hum
of
many
thousands
of
voices
and
lifting
my
eyes
i
saw
the
wide
circular
sweep
of
a
vast
arena
crowded
with
people
in
the
centre
and
well
to
the
front
of
the
uplifted
tiers
of
seats
there
was
a
gorgeous
pavilion
of
gold
draped
with
gaudy
coloured
silk
and
hung
with
festoons
of
roses
wherein
sat
a
man
royally
robed
and
crowned
and
wearing
jewels
in
such
profusion
as
to
seem
literally
clothed
in
flashing
points
of
light
beautiful
women
were
gathered
round
him
boys
with
musical
instruments
crouched
at
his
feet
attendants
stood
on
every
hand
to
minister
to
his
slightest
call
or
signal
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
as
upon
some
worshipped
god
of
a
nation
idolatry
i
felt
and
knew
that
i
was
looking
upon
the
of
the
roman
tyrant
nero
and
i
wondered
vaguely
how
it
chanced
that
he
in
all
the
splendour
of
his
wild
and
terrible
career
of
wickedness
should
be
brought
into
this
phantasmagoria
of
dream
in
which
i
and
one
other
alone
seemed
to
be
chiefly
concerned
there
were
strange
noises
in
my
ears
the
loud
din
of
trumpets
the
softer
sound
of
harps
played
enchantingly
in
some
distance
the
loud
buzzing
of
the
voices
of
the
multitude
and
then
all
at
once
the
roar
as
of
angry
wild
beasts
in
impatience
or
pain
the
time
of
this
vision
seemed
to
be
late
afternoon
i
thought
i
could
see
a
line
of
deep
rose
colour
in
a
sky
where
the
sun
had
lately
set
the
flare
of
torches
glimmered
all
round
the
arena
and
beyond
it
striking
vivid
brilliancy
from
the
jewels
on
nero
breast
and
throwing
into
strong
relief
the
groups
of
soldiers
and
people
immediately
around
him
i
perceived
now
that
the
centre
of
the
arena
previously
empty
had
become
the
one
spot
on
which
the
looks
of
the
people
began
to
turn
one
woman
stood
there
all
alone
clad
in
white
her
arms
crossed
on
her
breast
so
still
was
she
so
apparently
unconscious
of
her
position
that
the
mob
ever
irritated
by
calmness
grew
suddenly
furious
and
a
fierce
cry
arose
ad
leones
ad
leones
the
great
emperor
stirred
from
his
indolent
position
and
leaned
forward
with
a
sudden
look
of
interest
on
his
lowering
features
and
as
he
did
so
a
man
attired
in
the
costume
of
a
gladiator
entered
the
arena
from
one
of
its
side
doors
and
with
a
calm
step
and
assured
demeanour
walked
up
to
the
front
of
the
royal
dais
and
there
dropped
on
one
knee
then
quickly
rising
he
drew
himself
erect
and
waited
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
woman
who
stood
as
immovably
as
a
statue
apparently
resigned
to
some
untoward
fate
and
again
the
vast
crowd
shouted
ad
leones
ad
leones
there
came
a
heavy
grating
noise
of
drawn
bolts
and
bars
the
sound
of
falling
chains
then
a
savage
animal
roar
and
two
lean
and
ferocious
lions
sprang
into
the
arena
lashing
their
tails
their
manes
bristling
and
their
eyes
aglare
quick
as
thought
the
gladiator
stood
in
their
path
and
i
swiftly
recognised
the
nature
of
the
that
had
brought
the
emperor
and
all
this
brave
and
glittering
show
of
humanity
out
to
watch
what
to
them
was
merely
a
the
life
of
a
christian
dashed
out
by
the
claws
and
fangs
of
wild
beasts
a
common
pastime
all
unchecked
by
either
the
mercy
of
man
or
the
intervention
of
god
i
understood
as
clearly
as
if
the
explanation
had
been
volunteered
to
me
in
so
many
words
that
the
woman
who
awaited
her
death
so
immovably
had
only
one
chance
of
rescue
and
that
chance
was
through
the
gladiator
who
to
please
the
humour
of
the
emperor
had
been
brought
hither
to
combat
and
frighten
them
off
their
intended
victim
the
reward
for
him
if
he
succeeded
being
the
woman
herself
i
gazed
with
aching
straining
eyes
on
the
wonderful
and
my
heart
thrilled
as
i
saw
one
of
the
lions
stealthily
approach
the
solitary
martyr
and
prepare
to
spring
like
lightning
the
gladiator
was
upon
the
famished
brute
fighting
it
back
in
a
fierce
and
horrible
contest
while
the
second
lion
pouncing
forward
and
bent
on
a
similar
attack
was
similarly
repulsed
the
battle
between
man
and
beasts
was
furious
prolonged
and
terrible
to
witness
and
the
excitement
became
intense
ad
leones
ad
leones
was
now
the
universal
wild
shout
rising
ever
louder
and
louder
into
an
almost
frantic
clamour
the
woman
meanwhile
never
stirred
from
her
place
she
might
have
been
frozen
to
the
ground
where
she
stood
she
appeared
to
notice
neither
the
lions
who
were
ready
to
devour
her
nor
the
gladiator
who
combated
them
in
her
defence
and
i
studied
her
strangely
impassive
figure
with
keen
interest
waiting
to
see
her
face
for
i
instinctively
felt
i
should
recognise
it
presently
as
though
in
response
to
my
thought
she
turned
towards
me
and
as
in
a
mirror
i
saw
my
own
reflected
personality
again
as
i
had
seen
it
so
many
times
in
this
chain
of
strange
episodes
with
which
i
was
so
singularly
concerned
though
still
an
outside
spectator
between
her
and
what
i
felt
of
my
own
existing
self
there
seemed
to
be
a
pale
connecting
line
of
light
and
all
my
being
thrilled
towards
her
with
a
curiously
vague
anxiety
a
swirling
mist
came
before
my
eyes
suddenly
and
when
this
cleared
i
saw
that
the
combat
was
over
the
lions
lay
dead
and
weltering
in
their
blood
on
the
trampled
sand
of
the
arena
and
the
victorious
gladiator
stood
near
their
prone
bodies
triumphant
amid
the
deafening
cheers
of
the
crowd
wreaths
of
flowers
were
tossed
to
him
from
the
people
who
stood
up
in
their
seats
all
round
the
great
circle
to
hail
him
with
their
acclamations
and
the
emperor
lifting
his
unwieldy
body
from
under
his
canopy
of
gold
stretched
out
his
hand
as
a
sign
that
the
prize
which
the
dauntless
combatant
had
fought
to
win
was
his
he
at
once
obeyed
the
signal
but
now
the
woman
hitherto
so
passive
and
immovable
stirred
fixing
upon
the
gladiator
a
glance
of
the
deepest
reproach
and
anguish
she
raised
her
arms
warningly
as
though
forbidding
him
to
approach
her
and
then
fell
face
forward
on
the
ground
he
rushed
to
her
side
and
kneeling
down
sought
to
lift
her
then
suddenly
he
sprang
erect
with
a
loud
cry
great
emperor
i
asked
of
thee
a
living
love
and
this
is
dead
a
ripple
of
laughter
ran
through
the
crowd
the
emperor
leaned
forward
from
his
throne
and
smiled
thank
your
christian
god
for
that
he
said
our
pagan
deities
are
kinder
they
give
us
love
for
love
the
gladiator
gave
a
wild
gesture
of
despair
and
turned
his
face
upward
to
the
light
the
face
of
santoris
dead
dead
he
cried
of
what
use
then
is
life
dark
are
the
beloved
eyes
cold
is
the
generous
heart
the
fight
has
been
in
vain
my
victory
mocks
me
with
its
triumph
the
world
is
empty
again
the
laughter
of
the
populace
stirred
the
air
go
to
man
and
the
rough
voice
of
nero
sounded
harshly
above
the
murmurous
din
the
world
was
never
the
worse
for
one
woman
the
less
wouldst
thou
also
be
a
christian
take
heed
our
lions
are
still
hungry
thy
love
is
dead
is
true
but
we
have
not
killed
her
she
trusted
in
her
god
and
he
has
robbed
thee
of
thy
lawful
possession
blame
him
not
us
go
hence
with
thy
laurels
bravely
won
nero
commends
thy
prowess
he
flung
a
purse
of
gold
at
the
gladiator
feet
and
then
i
saw
the
whole
scene
melt
away
into
a
confused
mass
of
light
and
colour
till
all
was
merely
a
haze
floating
before
my
eyes
yet
i
was
hardly
allowed
a
moment
respite
before
another
scene
presented
itself
like
a
painting
upon
the
curtain
of
vapour
which
hung
so
persistently
in
front
of
me
a
scene
which
struck
a
closer
chord
upon
my
memory
than
any
i
had
yet
beheld
the
cool
spacious
interior
of
a
hall
or
studio
slowly
disclosed
itself
to
my
view
it
was
open
to
an
enchanting
vista
of
terraced
gardens
and
dark
undulating
woods
and
gay
parterres
of
brilliant
blossom
were
spread
in
front
of
it
like
a
wonderfully
patterned
carpet
of
intricate
and
exquisite
design
within
it
was
all
the
picturesque
grace
and
confusion
of
an
artist
surroundings
and
at
a
great
easel
working
assiduously
was
one
who
seemed
to
be
the
artist
himself
his
face
turned
from
me
towards
his
canvas
posed
before
him
in
an
attitude
of
indolent
grace
was
a
woman
arrayed
in
clinging
diaphanous
drapery
a
few
priceless
jewels
gleaming
here
and
there
like
stars
upon
her
bosom
and
arms
her
hair
falling
in
loose
waves
from
a
band
of
pale
blue
velvet
fastened
across
it
was
of
a
warm
brown
hue
like
an
autumn
leaf
with
the
sun
upon
it
and
i
could
see
that
whatever
she
might
be
according
to
the
strictest
canons
of
beauty
the
man
who
was
painting
her
portrait
considered
her
more
than
beautiful
i
heard
his
voice
in
the
low
murmurous
yet
perfectly
distinct
way
in
which
all
sounds
were
conveyed
to
me
in
this
dream
pageant
it
was
exactly
as
if
persons
on
the
stage
were
speaking
to
an
audience
if
we
could
understand
each
other
he
said
i
think
all
would
be
well
with
us
in
time
and
eternity
there
was
a
pause
the
picturesque
scene
before
me
seemed
to
glow
and
gather
intensity
as
i
gazed
if
you
could
see
what
is
in
my
heart
he
continued
you
would
be
satisfied
that
no
greater
love
was
ever
given
to
woman
than
mine
for
you
yet
i
would
not
say
i
give
it
to
you
for
i
have
striven
against
it
he
paused
and
when
he
spoke
again
his
words
were
so
distinct
that
they
seemed
close
to
my
ears
it
has
been
wrung
out
of
my
very
blood
and
soul
i
can
no
more
resist
it
than
i
can
resist
the
force
of
the
air
by
which
i
live
and
breathe
i
ought
not
to
love
you
you
are
a
joy
forbidden
to
me
and
yet
i
feel
rightly
speaking
that
you
are
already
mine
that
you
belong
to
me
as
the
other
half
of
myself
and
that
this
has
been
so
from
the
beginning
when
god
first
ordained
the
mating
of
souls
i
tell
you
i
feel
this
but
can
not
explain
it
and
i
grasp
at
you
as
my
one
hope
of
joy
i
can
not
let
you
go
she
was
silent
save
for
a
deep
sigh
that
stirred
her
bosom
under
its
folded
lace
and
made
her
jewels
sparkle
like
sunbeams
on
the
sea
if
i
lose
you
now
having
known
and
loved
you
he
went
on
i
lose
my
art
not
that
this
would
matter
her
voice
trembled
on
the
air
it
would
matter
a
great
deal
she
said
softly
to
the
world
the
world
he
echoed
what
need
i
care
for
it
nothing
seems
of
value
to
me
where
you
are
not
i
am
nerveless
senseless
hopeless
without
you
my
inspiration
such
as
it
is
comes
from
you
she
moved
restlessly
her
face
was
turned
slightly
away
so
that
i
could
not
see
it
my
inspiration
comes
from
you
he
repeated
the
tender
look
of
your
eyes
fills
me
with
dreams
which
might
i
do
not
say
would
realise
themselves
in
a
life
renown
but
all
this
is
perhaps
nothing
to
you
what
after
all
can
i
offer
you
nothing
but
love
and
here
in
florence
you
could
command
more
lovers
than
there
are
days
in
the
week
did
you
choose
but
people
say
you
are
untouchable
by
love
even
at
its
best
now
i
here
he
stopped
abruptly
and
laid
down
his
brush
looking
full
at
her
i
he
continued
love
you
at
neither
best
nor
worst
but
simply
and
entirely
with
all
of
myself
all
that
a
man
can
be
in
passionate
heart
soul
and
body
how
the
words
rang
out
i
could
have
sworn
they
were
spoken
close
beside
me
and
not
by
in
a
dream
if
you
loved
me
ah
god
what
that
would
mean
if
you
dared
to
brave
everything
if
you
had
the
courage
of
love
to
break
down
all
barriers
between
yourself
and
me
but
you
will
not
do
this
the
sacrifice
would
be
too
great
too
unusual
you
think
it
would
the
question
was
scarcely
breathed
a
look
of
sudden
amazement
lightened
his
face
then
he
replied
gently
i
think
it
would
women
are
impulsive
generous
to
a
fault
they
give
what
they
afterwards
regret
who
can
blame
them
you
have
much
to
lose
by
such
a
sacrifice
as
i
should
ask
of
you
i
have
all
to
gain
i
must
not
be
selfish
but
i
love
you
and
your
love
would
be
to
more
than
the
hope
of
heaven
and
now
strange
echoes
of
a
modern
poet
rhyme
became
mingled
in
my
dream
you
have
chosen
and
clung
to
the
chance
they
sent
you
life
sweet
as
perfume
and
pure
as
prayer
but
will
it
not
one
day
in
heaven
repent
you
will
they
solace
you
wholly
the
days
that
were
will
you
lift
up
your
eyes
between
sadness
and
bliss
meet
mine
and
see
where
the
great
love
is
and
tremble
and
turn
and
be
changed
content
you
the
gate
is
strait
i
shall
not
be
there
yet
i
know
this
well
were
you
once
sealed
mine
mine
in
the
blood
beat
mine
in
the
breath
mixed
into
me
as
honey
in
wine
not
time
that
sayeth
and
gainsayeth
nor
all
strong
things
had
severed
us
then
not
wrath
of
gods
nor
wisdom
of
men
nor
all
things
earthly
nor
all
divine
nor
joy
nor
sorrow
nor
life
nor
death
i
watched
with
a
deepening
thrill
of
anxiety
the
scene
in
the
studio
and
my
thoughts
centred
themselves
upon
the
woman
who
sat
there
so
quietly
seeming
all
unmoved
by
the
knowledge
that
she
held
a
life
and
future
fame
in
her
hands
the
artist
took
up
his
palette
and
brushes
again
and
began
to
work
swiftly
his
hand
trembling
a
little
you
have
my
whole
confession
now
he
said
you
know
that
you
are
the
eyes
of
the
world
to
me
the
glory
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
all
my
art
is
in
your
smile
all
my
life
responds
to
your
touch
without
you
i
am
can
be
nothing
cosmo
de
medicis
at
this
name
a
kind
of
shadow
crept
upon
the
scene
together
with
a
sense
of
cold
cosmo
de
medicis
he
repeated
slowly
my
patron
would
scarcely
thank
me
for
the
avowals
i
have
made
to
his
fair
ward
one
whom
he
intends
to
honour
with
his
own
alliance
i
am
here
by
his
order
to
paint
the
portrait
of
his
future
bride
not
to
look
at
her
with
the
eyes
of
a
lover
but
the
task
is
too
difficult
a
little
sound
escaped
her
like
a
smothered
cry
of
pain
he
turned
towards
her
something
in
your
face
he
said
a
touch
of
longing
in
your
sweet
eyes
has
made
me
risk
telling
you
all
so
that
you
may
at
least
choose
your
own
way
of
love
and
life
for
there
is
no
real
life
without
love
suddenly
she
rose
and
confronted
him
and
once
again
as
in
a
magic
mirror
i
saw
my
own
reflected
personality
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
yet
a
smile
quivered
on
her
mouth
my
beloved
she
said
and
then
paused
as
if
afraid
a
look
of
wonder
and
rapture
came
on
his
face
like
the
light
of
sunrise
and
i
recognised
the
now
familiar
features
of
santoris
very
gently
he
laid
down
his
palette
and
brushes
and
stood
waiting
in
a
kind
of
half
expectancy
half
doubt
my
beloved
she
repeated
have
you
not
seen
do
you
not
know
o
my
genius
my
angel
am
i
so
hard
to
read
so
difficult
to
win
her
voice
broke
in
a
sob
she
made
an
uncertain
step
forward
and
he
sprang
to
meet
her
i
love
you
love
you
she
cried
passionately
let
the
whole
world
forsake
me
if
only
you
remain
i
am
all
yours
do
with
me
as
you
will
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
straining
her
to
his
heart
with
all
the
passion
of
a
lover
embrace
their
lips
met
and
for
a
brief
space
they
were
lost
in
that
sudden
and
divine
rapture
that
comes
but
once
in
a
lifetime
when
like
a
shivering
sense
of
cold
the
name
again
was
whispered
cosmo
de
medicis
a
shadow
fell
across
the
scene
and
a
woman
dark
and
stood
like
a
blot
in
the
sunlit
brightness
of
the
studio
a
woman
very
richly
attired
who
gazed
fixedly
at
the
lovers
with
round
suspicious
eyes
and
a
sneering
smile
the
artist
turned
and
saw
her
his
face
changed
from
joy
to
a
pale
anxiety
yet
holding
his
love
with
one
arm
he
flung
defiance
at
her
with
uplifted
head
and
fearless
demeanour
spy
he
exclaimed
do
your
worst
let
us
have
an
end
of
your
serpent
vigilance
and
perfidy
better
death
than
the
constant
sight
of
you
what
have
you
not
watched
us
long
enough
to
make
discovery
easy
do
your
worst
i
say
and
quickly
the
cruel
smile
deepened
on
the
woman
mouth
she
made
no
answer
but
simply
raised
her
hand
in
immediate
obedience
to
the
signal
a
man
clad
in
the
florentine
dress
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
wearing
a
singular
collar
of
jewels
stepped
out
from
behind
a
curtain
attended
by
two
other
men
who
by
their
dress
were
or
seemed
to
be
of
inferior
rank
without
a
word
these
three
threw
themselves
upon
the
unarmed
and
defenceless
painter
with
the
fury
of
wild
animals
pouncing
on
prey
there
was
a
brief
and
breathless
struggle
three
daggers
gleamed
in
air
a
shriek
rang
through
the
stillness
another
instant
and
the
victim
lay
dead
stabbed
to
the
heart
while
she
who
had
just
clung
to
his
living
body
and
felt
the
warmth
of
his
living
lips
against
hers
dropped
on
her
knees
beside
the
corpse
with
wild
waitings
of
madness
and
despair
another
crime
on
your
soul
cosmo
de
medicis
she
cried
another
murder
of
a
nobler
life
than
your
own
may
heaven
curse
you
for
it
but
you
have
not
parted
my
love
from
me
no
you
have
but
united
us
for
ever
we
escape
you
and
your
spies
thus
and
snatching
a
dagger
from
the
hand
of
one
of
the
assassins
before
he
could
prevent
her
she
plunged
it
into
her
own
breast
she
fell
without
a
groan
and
i
saw
as
in
a
mist
of
breath
on
a
mirror
the
sudden
horror
on
the
faces
of
the
men
and
the
one
woman
who
were
left
to
contemplate
the
ghastly
deed
they
had
committed
and
then
noting
as
in
some
old
blurred
picture
the
features
of
the
man
who
wore
the
collar
of
jewels
i
felt
that
i
knew
him
yet
i
could
not
place
him
in
any
corner
of
my
immediate
recognition
gradually
this
strange
scene
of
cool
white
marble
vastness
with
its
brilliant
vista
of
flowers
and
foliage
under
the
bright
italian
sky
and
the
betrayed
lovers
lying
dead
beside
each
other
in
the
presence
of
their
murderers
passed
away
like
a
floating
cloud
and
the
same
slow
calm
voice
i
had
heard
once
before
now
spoke
again
in
sad
stern
accents
jealousy
is
cruel
as
the
grave
the
coals
thereof
are
coals
of
fire
which
hath
a
most
vehement
flame
many
waters
can
not
quench
love
neither
can
the
floods
drown
it
if
a
man
would
give
all
his
substance
for
love
it
would
be
utterly
contemned
i
closed
my
eyes
or
thought
i
closed
them
a
vague
terror
was
growing
upon
me
a
terror
of
myself
and
a
still
greater
terror
of
the
man
beside
me
who
held
my
hand
yet
something
prevented
me
from
turning
my
head
to
look
at
him
and
another
still
stronger
emotion
possessed
me
with
a
force
so
overpowering
that
i
could
hardly
breathe
under
the
weight
and
pain
of
it
but
i
could
give
it
no
name
i
could
not
think
at
all
and
i
had
ceased
even
to
wonder
at
the
strangeness
and
variety
of
these
visions
or
full
of
colour
and
sound
which
succeeded
each
other
so
swiftly
therefore
it
hardly
seemed
remarkable
to
me
when
i
saw
the
heavy
curtain
of
mist
which
hung
in
front
of
my
eyes
suddenly
reft
asunder
in
many
places
and
broken
into
a
semblance
of
the
sea
a
wild
sea
gloomily
grey
and
grand
in
its
onsweeping
wrath
its
huge
billows
rose
and
fell
like
moving
mountains
convulsed
by
an
earthquake
light
and
shadow
combated
against
each
other
in
its
dark
abysmal
depths
and
among
its
toppling
crests
of
foam
i
could
hear
the
savage
hiss
and
boom
of
breakers
dashing
themselves
to
pieces
on
some
unseen
rocky
coast
far
away
and
my
heart
grew
cold
with
dread
as
i
beheld
a
ship
in
full
sail
struggling
against
the
heavy
onslaught
of
the
wind
on
that
heaving
wilderness
of
waters
like
a
mere
feather
lost
from
a
wing
flying
along
like
a
hunted
creature
she
staggered
and
plunged
her
bowsprit
dipping
into
deep
chasms
from
which
she
was
tossed
shudderingly
upward
again
as
in
light
contempt
and
as
she
came
nearer
and
nearer
into
my
view
i
could
discern
some
of
the
human
beings
on
board
the
man
at
the
wheel
with
keen
eyes
peering
into
the
gathering
gloom
of
the
storm
his
hair
and
face
dashed
with
spray
the
sailors
fighting
hard
to
save
the
rigging
from
being
torn
to
pieces
and
flung
into
the
sea
then
a
sudden
huge
wave
swept
her
directly
in
front
of
me
and
i
saw
the
two
distinct
personalities
that
had
been
so
constantly
presented
to
me
during
this
strange
experience
the
man
with
the
face
of
santoris
the
woman
with
my
own
face
so
truly
reflected
that
i
might
have
been
looking
at
myself
in
a
mirror
and
just
now
the
resemblance
to
us
both
was
made
more
close
and
striking
than
it
had
been
in
any
of
the
previous
visions
that
is
to
say
the
likenesses
of
ourselves
were
given
almost
as
we
now
existed
the
man
held
the
woman
beside
him
closely
clasped
with
one
arm
supporting
her
and
himself
with
the
other
thrown
round
one
of
the
shaking
masts
i
saw
her
look
up
to
him
with
the
light
of
a
great
and
passionate
love
in
her
eyes
and
i
heard
him
say
the
end
of
sorrow
and
the
beginning
of
joy
you
are
not
afraid
afraid
and
her
voice
had
no
tremor
with
you
he
caught
her
closer
to
his
heart
and
kissed
her
not
once
but
many
times
in
a
kind
of
mingled
rapture
and
despair
this
is
death
my
beloved
he
said
and
her
answer
pealed
out
with
tender
certainty
no
not
death
but
life
and
love
a
cry
went
up
from
the
sailors
a
cry
of
heartrending
agony
a
mass
of
enormous
billows
rolling
steadily
on
together
hurled
themselves
like
giant
assassins
upon
the
frail
and
helpless
vessel
and
engulfed
it
it
disappeared
with
awful
swiftness
like
a
small
blot
on
the
ocean
sucked
down
into
the
whirl
of
water
the
vast
and
solemn
greyness
of
the
sea
spread
over
it
like
a
pall
it
was
a
nothing
gone
into
nothingness
i
watched
one
giant
wave
rise
in
a
crystalline
glitter
of
dark
sapphire
and
curl
over
the
spot
where
all
that
human
life
and
human
love
had
disappeared
and
then
there
came
upon
my
soul
a
sudden
sense
of
intense
calm
the
great
sea
smoothed
itself
out
before
my
eyes
into
fine
ripples
which
dispersed
gradually
into
mist
again
and
almost
i
found
my
voice
almost
my
lips
opened
to
ask
what
means
this
vision
of
the
sea
when
a
sound
of
music
checked
me
on
the
verge
of
utterance
the
music
of
delicate
strings
as
of
a
thousand
harps
in
heaven
i
listened
with
every
sense
caught
and
entranced
my
gaze
still
fixed
half
unseeingly
upon
the
heavy
grey
film
which
hung
before
me
that
mystic
upon
which
some
divine
painter
had
depicted
in
form
and
colour
scenes
which
i
in
a
sort
of
dim
strangeness
recognised
yet
could
not
understand
and
as
i
looked
a
rainbow
with
every
hue
intensified
to
such
a
burning
depth
of
brilliancy
that
its
light
was
almost
intolerably
dazzling
sprang
in
a
perfect
arch
across
the
cloud
i
uttered
an
involuntary
cry
of
rapture
for
it
was
like
no
earthly
rainbow
i
had
ever
seen
its
palpitating
radiance
seemed
to
penetrate
into
the
very
core
and
centre
of
space
aerially
delicate
yet
deep
each
separate
colour
glowed
with
the
fervent
splendour
of
a
heaven
undreamed
of
by
mere
mortality
and
too
glorious
for
mortal
description
it
was
the
shining
repentance
of
the
storm
the
assurance
of
joy
after
sorrow
the
passionate
love
of
the
soul
rising
upwards
in
perfect
form
and
beauty
after
long
imprisonment
in
depths
of
repression
and
solitude
it
was
anything
and
everything
that
could
be
thought
or
imagined
of
divinest
promise
my
heart
beat
quickly
tears
sprang
to
my
eyes
and
almost
unconsciously
i
pressed
the
kind
strong
hand
that
held
mine
it
trembled
ever
so
slightly
but
i
was
too
absorbed
in
watching
that
triumphal
arch
across
the
sky
to
heed
the
movement
by
degrees
the
lustrous
hues
began
to
pale
very
slowly
and
almost
imperceptibly
they
grew
fainter
and
fainter
till
at
last
all
was
misty
grey
as
before
save
in
one
place
where
there
were
long
rays
of
light
like
the
falling
of
silvery
rain
and
then
came
strange
rapidly
passing
scenes
as
of
cloud
forms
constantly
shifting
and
changing
in
all
of
which
i
discerned
the
same
two
personalities
so
like
and
yet
so
unlike
ourselves
who
were
the
dumb
witnesses
of
every
episode
but
everything
now
passed
in
absolute
silence
there
was
no
mysterious
music
the
voices
had
ceased
all
was
mute
suddenly
there
came
a
change
over
the
face
of
what
i
thought
the
sky
the
clouds
were
torn
asunder
as
it
were
to
show
a
breadth
of
burning
amber
and
rose
and
i
beheld
the
semblance
of
a
great
closed
gateway
barred
across
as
with
gold
here
a
figure
slowly
shaped
itself
the
figure
of
a
woman
who
knelt
against
the
closed
barrier
with
hands
clasped
and
uplifted
in
pitiful
beseeching
so
strangely
desolate
and
solitary
was
her
aspect
in
all
that
heavenly
brilliancy
that
i
could
almost
have
wept
for
her
shut
out
as
she
seemed
from
some
mystic
unknown
glory
round
her
swept
the
great
circle
of
the
heavens
beneath
her
and
above
her
were
the
deserts
of
infinite
space
and
she
a
fragile
soul
rendered
immortal
by
quenchless
fires
of
love
and
hope
and
memory
hovered
between
the
deeps
of
immeasurable
vastness
like
a
fluttering
leaf
or
flake
of
snow
my
heart
ached
for
her
my
lips
moved
unconsciously
in
prayer
o
leave
her
not
always
exiled
and
alone
i
murmured
inwardly
dear
god
have
pity
unbar
the
gate
and
let
her
in
she
has
waited
so
long
the
hand
holding
mine
strengthened
its
clasp
and
the
warm
close
pressure
sent
a
thrill
through
my
veins
almost
i
would
have
turned
to
look
at
my
companion
had
i
not
suddenly
seen
the
closed
gateway
in
the
heavens
begin
to
open
slowly
allowing
a
flood
of
golden
radiance
to
pour
out
like
the
steady
flowing
of
a
broad
stream
the
kneeling
woman
figure
remained
plainly
discernible
but
seemed
to
be
gradually
melting
into
the
light
which
surrounded
it
and
then
something
i
know
not
what
shook
me
down
from
the
pinnacle
of
vision
hardly
aware
of
my
own
action
i
withdrew
my
hand
from
my
companion
and
saw
just
the
solemn
grandeur
of
loch
coruisk
with
a
deep
amber
glow
streaming
over
the
summit
of
the
mountains
flung
upward
by
the
setting
sun
nothing
more
i
heaved
an
involuntary
sigh
and
at
last
with
some
little
hesitation
and
dread
looked
full
at
santoris
his
eyes
met
mine
steadfastly
he
was
very
pale
so
we
faced
each
other
for
a
moment
then
he
said
quietly
how
quickly
the
time
has
passed
this
is
the
best
moment
of
the
sunset
when
that
glory
fades
we
shall
have
seen
all
ix
doubtful
destiny
his
voice
was
calm
and
conventional
yet
i
thought
i
detected
a
thrill
of
sadness
in
it
which
touched
me
to
a
kind
of
inexplicable
remorse
and
i
turned
to
him
quickly
hardly
conscious
of
the
words
i
uttered
must
the
glory
fade
i
said
almost
pleadingly
why
should
it
not
remain
with
us
he
did
not
reply
at
once
a
shadow
of
something
like
sternness
clouded
his
brows
and
i
began
to
be
afraid
yet
afraid
of
what
not
of
him
but
of
myself
lest
i
should
unwittingly
lose
all
i
had
gained
but
then
the
question
presented
itself
what
had
i
gained
could
i
explain
it
even
to
myself
there
was
nothing
in
any
way
tangible
of
which
to
say
i
possess
this
or
i
have
secured
that
for
reducing
all
circumstances
to
a
prosaic
level
all
that
i
knew
was
that
i
had
met
in
my
present
companion
a
man
who
had
a
singular
almost
compelling
attractiveness
and
with
whose
personality
i
seemed
to
be
familiar
also
that
under
some
power
which
he
might
possibly
have
exerted
i
had
in
an
unexpected
place
and
at
an
unexpected
time
seen
certain
visions
or
which
might
or
might
not
be
the
working
of
my
own
brain
under
a
temporary
magnetic
influence
i
was
fully
aware
that
such
things
could
happen
and
yet
i
was
not
by
any
means
sure
that
they
had
so
happened
in
this
case
and
while
i
was
thus
hurriedly
trying
to
think
out
the
problem
he
replied
to
my
question
that
depends
on
ourselves
he
said
on
you
perhaps
more
than
any
other
i
looked
up
at
him
wonderingly
on
me
i
echoed
he
smiled
a
little
why
yes
a
woman
always
decides
i
turned
my
eyes
again
towards
the
sky
long
lines
of
delicate
pale
blue
and
green
were
now
intermingled
with
the
amber
light
of
the
and
the
whole
scene
was
one
of
indescribable
grandeur
and
beauty
i
wish
i
could
understand
i
murmured
let
me
help
you
he
said
gently
possibly
i
can
make
things
clearer
for
you
you
are
just
now
under
the
spell
of
your
own
psychic
impressions
and
memories
you
think
you
have
seen
strange
episodes
these
are
nothing
but
pictures
stored
far
away
back
in
the
cells
of
your
spiritual
brain
which
through
the
medium
of
your
present
material
brain
project
on
your
vision
not
only
presentments
and
reflections
of
past
scenes
and
events
but
which
also
reproduce
the
very
words
and
sounds
attending
those
scenes
and
events
that
is
all
loch
coruisk
has
shown
you
nothing
but
itself
in
varying
effects
of
light
and
cloud
there
is
no
mystery
here
but
the
everlasting
mystery
of
nature
in
which
you
and
i
play
our
several
parts
what
you
have
seen
or
heard
i
do
not
know
for
each
individual
experience
is
and
always
must
be
different
all
that
i
am
fully
conscious
of
is
that
our
having
met
and
our
being
here
together
is
as
it
were
the
mending
of
a
broken
chain
but
it
rests
with
you
and
even
with
me
to
break
it
once
more
if
we
choose
i
was
silent
not
because
i
could
not
but
because
i
dared
not
speak
all
my
life
seemed
suddenly
to
hang
on
the
point
of
a
of
possibility
i
think
he
continued
in
the
same
quiet
voice
that
just
now
we
may
let
things
take
their
ordinary
course
you
and
i
here
he
paused
and
impelled
by
some
secret
emotion
i
lifted
my
eyes
to
his
instinctively
and
with
a
rush
of
feeling
we
stretched
out
our
hands
to
each
other
he
clasped
mine
in
his
own
and
stooping
his
head
kissed
them
tenderly
you
and
i
he
went
on
have
met
before
in
many
a
phase
of
life
and
on
many
a
plane
of
thought
and
i
believe
we
know
and
realise
this
let
us
be
satisfied
so
far
and
if
destiny
has
anything
of
happiness
or
wisdom
in
store
for
us
let
us
try
to
assist
its
fulfilment
and
not
stand
in
the
way
i
found
my
voice
suddenly
but
if
others
stand
in
the
way
i
said
he
smiled
surely
it
will
be
our
own
fault
if
we
allow
them
to
assume
such
a
position
he
answered
i
left
my
hands
in
his
another
moment
the
fact
that
he
held
them
gave
me
a
sense
of
peace
and
security
sometimes
on
a
long
walk
through
field
and
forest
i
said
softly
one
may
miss
the
nearest
road
home
and
one
is
glad
to
be
told
which
path
to
follow
yes
he
interrupted
me
one
is
glad
to
be
told
his
eyes
were
bent
upon
me
with
an
enigmatical
expression
half
commanding
half
appealing
then
will
you
tell
me
i
began
all
that
i
can
he
said
drawing
me
a
little
closer
towards
him
all
that
i
may
and
you
you
must
tell
me
i
what
can
i
tell
you
and
i
smiled
i
know
nothing
you
know
one
thing
which
is
all
things
he
answered
but
for
that
i
must
still
wait
he
let
go
my
hands
and
turned
away
shading
his
eyes
from
the
glare
of
gold
which
now
spread
far
and
wide
over
the
heavens
turning
the
sullen
waters
of
loch
coruisk
to
a
tawny
orange
against
the
black
purple
of
the
surrounding
hills
i
see
our
men
he
then
said
in
his
ordinary
tone
they
are
looking
for
us
we
must
be
going
my
heart
beat
quickly
a
longing
to
speak
what
i
hardly
dared
to
think
was
strong
upon
me
but
some
inward
restraint
gripped
me
as
with
iron
and
my
spirit
beat
itself
like
a
caged
bird
against
its
prison
bars
in
vain
i
left
my
rocky
throne
and
heather
canopy
with
slow
reluctance
and
he
saw
this
you
are
sorry
to
come
away
he
said
kindly
and
with
a
smile
i
can
quite
understand
it
it
is
a
beautiful
scene
i
stood
quite
still
looking
at
him
a
host
of
recollections
began
to
crowd
upon
me
threatening
havoc
to
my
is
it
not
something
more
than
beautiful
i
asked
and
my
voice
trembled
in
spite
of
myself
to
you
as
well
as
to
me
he
met
my
earnest
gaze
with
a
sudden
deeper
light
in
his
own
eyes
dear
to
me
it
is
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
he
said
but
whether
it
is
the
same
to
you
i
can
not
say
i
have
not
the
right
to
think
so
far
come
a
choking
sense
of
tears
was
in
my
throat
as
i
moved
on
by
his
side
why
could
i
not
speak
frankly
and
tell
him
that
i
knew
as
well
as
he
did
that
now
there
was
no
life
anywhere
for
me
where
he
was
not
but
had
it
come
to
this
yes
truly
it
had
come
to
this
then
was
it
a
real
love
that
i
felt
or
merely
a
blind
obedience
to
some
hypnotic
influence
the
doubt
suggested
itself
like
a
whisper
from
some
evil
spirit
and
i
strove
not
to
listen
presently
he
took
my
hand
in
his
as
before
and
guided
me
carefully
over
the
slippery
boulders
and
stones
wet
with
the
overflowing
of
the
mountain
torrent
and
the
underlying
morass
which
warned
us
of
its
vicinity
by
the
quantity
of
growing
in
profusion
everywhere
almost
in
silence
we
reached
the
shore
where
the
launch
was
in
waiting
for
us
and
in
silence
we
sat
together
in
the
stern
as
the
boat
cut
its
swift
way
through
little
waves
like
molten
gold
and
opal
sparkling
with
the
iridescent
reflections
of
the
sun
i
see
harland
yacht
has
returned
to
her
moorings
he
said
after
a
while
addressing
his
men
when
did
she
come
back
immediately
after
you
left
sir
was
the
reply
i
looked
and
saw
the
two
yachts
the
and
the
anchored
in
the
widest
part
of
loch
scavaig
the
one
with
the
disfiguring
funnels
that
make
even
the
most
magnificent
steam
yacht
unsightly
as
compared
with
a
sailing
vessel
the
other
a
perfect
picture
of
lightness
and
grace
resting
like
a
bird
with
folded
wings
on
the
glittering
surface
of
the
water
my
mind
was
disturbed
and
bewildered
i
felt
that
i
had
journeyed
through
immense
distances
of
space
and
cycles
of
time
during
that
brief
excursion
to
loch
coruisk
and
as
the
launch
rushed
onward
and
we
lost
sight
of
the
entrance
to
what
for
me
had
been
a
veritable
valley
of
vision
it
seemed
that
i
had
lived
through
centuries
rather
than
hours
one
thing
however
remained
positive
and
real
in
my
experience
and
this
was
the
personality
of
santoris
with
each
moment
that
passed
i
knew
it
better
the
flash
of
his
blue
eyes
his
sudden
fleeting
smile
the
turn
of
his
head
the
very
gesture
of
his
hand
all
these
were
as
familiar
to
me
as
the
reflection
of
my
own
face
in
a
mirror
and
now
there
was
no
wonderment
mingled
with
the
deepening
recognition
i
found
it
quite
natural
that
i
should
know
him
well
indeed
it
was
to
me
evident
that
i
had
known
him
always
what
troubled
me
however
was
a
subtle
fear
that
crept
insidiously
through
my
veins
like
a
shuddering
cold
a
terror
lest
something
to
which
i
could
give
no
name
should
separate
us
or
cause
us
to
misunderstand
each
other
for
the
psychic
lines
of
attraction
between
two
human
beings
are
finer
than
the
finest
gossamer
and
can
be
easily
broken
and
scattered
even
though
they
may
or
must
be
brought
together
again
after
long
lapses
of
time
but
so
many
opportunities
had
already
been
wasted
i
thought
through
some
recklessness
or
folly
either
on
his
part
or
mine
which
of
us
was
to
blame
i
looked
at
him
half
in
fear
half
in
appeal
as
he
sat
in
the
boat
with
his
head
turned
a
little
aside
from
me
he
seemed
grave
and
preoccupied
a
sudden
thrill
of
emotion
stirred
my
heart
tears
sprang
to
my
eyes
so
thickly
that
for
a
moment
i
could
scarcely
see
the
waves
that
glittered
and
danced
on
all
sides
like
millions
of
diamonds
a
change
had
swept
over
my
life
a
change
so
great
that
i
was
hardly
able
to
bear
it
it
was
too
swift
too
overpowering
to
be
calmly
considered
and
i
was
glad
when
we
came
alongside
the
and
i
saw
harland
on
deck
waiting
for
us
at
the
top
of
the
companion
ladder
well
he
called
to
me
was
it
a
good
sunset
glorious
i
answered
him
did
you
see
nothing
of
it
no
i
slept
soundly
and
only
woke
up
when
brayle
came
over
to
explain
that
catherine
had
taken
it
into
her
head
to
have
a
short
cruise
that
he
had
humoured
her
accordingly
and
that
they
had
just
come
back
to
anchorage
by
this
time
i
was
standing
beside
him
and
santoris
joined
us
so
your
doctor
came
to
look
after
you
he
said
with
a
smile
i
thought
he
would
not
trust
you
out
of
his
sight
too
long
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
harland
then
his
face
lightened
and
he
laughed
well
i
must
own
you
have
been
a
better
physician
than
he
for
the
moment
it
is
months
since
i
have
been
so
free
from
pain
i
very
glad
santoris
answered
and
now
would
you
and
your
friend
like
to
take
the
launch
back
to
your
own
yacht
or
will
you
stay
and
dine
with
me
harland
thought
a
moment
i
afraid
we
must
go
he
said
at
last
with
obvious
reluctance
captain
derrick
went
back
with
brayle
you
see
catherine
is
not
strong
and
she
has
not
been
quite
herself
and
we
must
not
leave
her
alone
if
you
are
willing
i
should
like
to
try
a
race
with
our
two
yachts
in
open
sea
electricity
against
steam
what
do
you
say
with
pleasure
and
santoris
looked
amused
but
as
i
am
sure
to
be
the
winner
you
must
give
me
the
privilege
of
entertaining
you
all
to
dinner
afterwards
is
that
settled
certainly
you
are
hospitality
itself
santoris
and
harland
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
what
time
shall
we
start
the
race
suppose
we
say
noon
agreed
we
then
prepared
to
go
i
turned
to
santoris
and
in
a
quiet
voice
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
in
escorting
me
to
loch
coruisk
and
for
the
pleasant
afternoon
we
had
passed
the
conventional
words
of
common
courtesy
seemed
to
myself
quite
absurd
however
they
had
to
be
uttered
and
he
accepted
them
with
the
usual
conventional
acknowledgment
when
i
was
just
about
to
descend
the
companion
ladder
he
asked
me
to
wait
a
moment
and
going
down
to
the
saloon
brought
me
the
bunch
of
madonna
lilies
i
had
found
in
that
special
cabin
which
as
he
had
said
was
destined
a
princess
you
will
take
these
i
hope
he
said
simply
i
raised
my
eyes
to
his
as
i
received
the
white
blossoms
from
his
hand
there
was
something
indefinable
and
fleeting
in
his
expression
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
we
had
suddenly
become
strangers
a
sense
of
loss
and
pain
affected
me
such
as
happens
when
someone
to
whom
we
are
deeply
attached
assumes
a
cold
and
distant
air
for
which
we
can
render
no
explanation
he
turned
from
me
as
quickly
as
i
from
him
and
i
descended
the
companion
ladder
followed
by
harland
in
a
few
seconds
we
had
put
several
between
ourselves
and
the
and
a
rush
of
foolish
tears
to
my
eyes
blurred
the
figure
of
santoris
as
he
lifted
his
cap
to
us
in
courteous
adieu
i
thought
harland
glanced
at
me
a
little
inquisitively
but
he
said
nothing
and
we
were
soon
on
board
the
where
catherine
stretched
out
in
a
deck
chair
watched
our
arrival
with
but
languid
interest
brayle
was
beside
her
and
looked
up
as
we
drew
near
with
a
supercilious
smile
so
the
electric
man
has
not
quite
made
away
with
you
he
said
carelessly
miss
harland
and
i
had
our
doubts
as
to
whether
we
should
ever
see
you
again
harland
fuzzy
eyebrows
drew
together
in
a
marked
frown
of
displeasure
indeed
he
ejaculated
drily
well
you
need
have
had
no
fears
on
that
score
the
man
as
you
call
santoris
is
an
excellent
host
and
has
no
sinister
designs
on
his
friends
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
and
brayle
with
an
elaborate
show
of
courtesy
set
chairs
for
his
patron
and
for
me
near
catherine
derrick
tells
me
that
the
electric
appliances
on
board
his
yacht
are
to
him
of
a
terrifying
character
and
that
he
would
not
risk
passing
so
much
as
one
night
on
such
a
vessel
harland
laughed
i
must
talk
to
derrick
he
said
then
approaching
his
daughter
he
asked
her
kindly
if
she
was
better
she
replied
in
the
affirmative
but
with
some
little
pettishness
my
nerves
are
all
unstrung
she
said
i
think
that
friend
of
yours
is
one
of
those
persons
who
draw
all
vitality
out
of
everybody
else
there
are
such
people
you
know
father
people
who
when
they
are
getting
old
and
feeble
go
about
taking
stores
of
fresh
life
out
of
others
he
looked
amused
you
are
full
of
fancies
catherine
he
said
and
no
logical
reasoning
will
ever
argue
you
out
of
them
santoris
is
all
right
for
one
thing
he
gave
me
great
relief
from
pain
ah
how
was
that
and
brayle
looked
up
sharply
with
sudden
interest
i
do
know
how
replied
harland
a
drop
or
two
of
fluid
worked
wonders
for
me
and
in
a
few
moments
i
felt
almost
well
he
tells
me
my
illness
is
not
incurable
a
curious
expression
difficult
to
define
flitted
over
brayle
face
you
had
better
take
care
he
said
curtly
invalids
should
never
try
experiments
i
surprised
that
a
man
in
your
condition
should
take
any
drug
from
the
hand
of
a
stranger
most
dangerous
interpolated
catherine
feebly
how
could
you
father
well
santoris
is
quite
a
stranger
said
harland
after
all
i
knew
him
at
college
you
think
you
knew
him
put
in
brayle
he
may
not
be
the
same
man
he
is
the
same
man
answered
harland
rather
testily
there
are
no
two
of
his
kind
in
the
world
brayle
lifted
his
eyebrows
with
a
mildly
affected
air
of
surprise
i
thought
you
had
your
doubts
of
course
i
had
and
have
my
doubts
concerning
everybody
and
everything
said
harland
and
i
suppose
i
shall
have
them
to
the
end
of
my
days
i
have
sometimes
doubted
even
your
good
intentions
towards
me
a
dark
flush
overspread
brayle
face
suddenly
and
as
suddenly
paled
he
laughed
a
little
forcedly
i
hardly
think
you
have
any
reason
to
do
so
he
said
harland
did
not
answer
but
turning
round
addressed
me
you
enjoyed
yourself
at
loch
coruisk
did
you
indeed
i
did
i
replied
with
emphasis
it
was
a
lovely
scene
never
to
be
forgotten
you
and
santoris
would
be
sure
to
get
on
well
together
said
catherine
rather
crossly
of
a
feather
you
know
i
smiled
i
was
too
much
taken
up
with
my
own
thoughts
to
pay
attention
to
her
evident
i
was
aware
that
brayle
watched
me
furtively
and
with
a
suspicious
air
and
there
was
a
curious
feeling
of
constraint
in
the
atmosphere
that
made
me
feel
i
had
somehow
displeased
my
hostess
but
the
matter
seemed
to
me
too
trifling
to
consider
and
as
soon
as
the
conversation
became
general
i
took
the
opportunity
to
slip
away
and
get
down
to
my
cabin
where
i
locked
the
door
and
gave
myself
up
to
the
freedom
of
my
own
meditations
they
were
at
first
bewildered
and
chaotic
but
gradually
my
mind
smoothed
itself
out
like
the
sea
i
had
looked
upon
in
my
vision
and
i
began
to
arrange
and
connect
the
various
incidents
of
my
strange
experience
in
a
more
or
less
coherent
form
according
to
psychic
consciousness
i
knew
what
they
all
meant
but
according
to
merely
material
and
earthly
reasoning
they
were
utterly
incomprehensible
if
i
listened
to
the
explanation
offered
by
my
inner
self
it
was
this
that
rafel
santoris
and
i
had
known
each
other
for
ages
longer
than
we
were
permitted
to
remember
that
the
or
rather
presented
to
me
were
only
a
few
selected
out
of
thousands
which
equally
concerned
us
and
which
were
stored
up
among
eternal
records
and
that
these
few
were
only
recalled
to
remind
me
of
circumstances
which
i
might
erroneously
think
were
all
entirely
forgotten
if
on
the
other
hand
i
preferred
to
accept
what
would
be
called
a
reasonable
and
practical
solution
of
the
enigma
i
would
say
that
being
imaginative
and
sensitive
i
had
been
easily
hypnotised
by
a
stronger
will
than
my
own
and
that
for
his
amusement
or
because
he
had
seen
in
me
the
possibility
of
a
case
santoris
had
tried
his
power
upon
me
and
forced
me
to
see
whatever
he
chose
to
conjure
up
in
order
to
bewilder
and
perplex
me
but
if
this
were
so
what
could
be
his
object
if
i
were
indeed
an
utter
stranger
to
him
why
should
he
take
this
trouble
i
found
myself
harassed
by
anxiety
and
dragged
between
two
opposing
influences
one
which
impelled
me
to
yield
myself
to
the
deep
sense
of
exquisite
happiness
peace
and
consolation
that
swept
over
my
spirit
like
the
touch
of
a
veritable
benediction
from
heaven
the
other
which
pushed
me
back
against
a
hard
wall
of
impregnable
fact
and
bade
me
suspect
my
dawning
joy
as
though
it
were
a
foe
that
night
we
were
a
curious
party
at
dinner
never
were
five
human
beings
more
oddly
brought
into
contact
and
conversation
with
each
other
we
were
absolutely
opposed
at
all
points
in
thought
in
feeling
and
in
sentiment
i
could
not
help
remembering
the
wonderful
network
of
shining
lines
i
had
seen
in
that
first
dream
of
mine
lines
which
were
apparently
mathematically
designed
to
meet
in
reciprocal
unity
the
lines
on
this
occasion
between
us
five
human
beings
were
an
almost
visible
tangle
i
found
my
best
refuge
in
silence
and
i
listened
in
vague
wonderment
to
the
flow
of
senseless
small
talk
poured
out
by
brayle
apparently
for
the
amusement
of
catherine
who
on
her
part
seemed
suddenly
possessed
by
a
spirit
of
wilfulness
and
enforced
gaiety
which
moved
her
to
utter
a
great
many
foolish
things
things
which
she
evidently
imagined
were
clever
there
is
nothing
perhaps
more
embarrassing
than
to
hear
a
woman
of
mature
years
giving
herself
away
by
the
childish
vapidness
of
her
talk
and
exhibiting
not
only
a
lack
of
mental
poise
but
also
utter
tactlessness
however
catherine
rattled
on
and
brayle
rattled
with
her
harland
threw
in
occasional
monosyllables
but
for
the
most
part
was
evidently
caught
in
a
kind
of
dusty
spider
web
of
thought
and
i
spoke
not
at
all
unless
spoken
to
presently
i
met
catherine
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
a
sort
of
round
curiosity
i
think
your
day
outing
has
done
you
good
she
said
you
look
wonderfully
well
i
am
well
i
answered
her
i
have
been
well
all
the
time
yes
but
you
have
looked
as
you
look
she
said
you
have
quite
a
transformed
air
transformed
i
echoed
smiling
in
what
way
harland
turned
and
surveyed
me
critically
upon
my
word
i
think
catherine
is
right
he
said
there
is
something
different
about
you
though
i
can
not
explain
what
it
is
i
felt
the
colour
rising
hotly
to
my
face
but
i
endeavoured
to
appear
unconcerned
you
look
said
brayle
with
a
quick
glance
from
his
narrowly
set
eyes
as
if
you
had
been
through
a
happy
experience
perhaps
i
have
i
answered
quietly
it
has
certainly
been
a
very
happy
day
what
is
your
opinion
of
santoris
asked
harland
suddenly
you
spent
a
couple
of
hours
alone
in
his
company
you
must
have
formed
some
idea
i
replied
at
once
without
taking
thought
i
think
him
quite
an
exceptional
man
i
said
good
and
and
i
fancy
he
must
have
gone
through
much
difficult
experience
to
make
him
what
he
is
i
entirely
disagree
with
you
said
brayle
quickly
i
taken
his
measure
and
i
think
it
a
fairly
correct
one
i
believe
him
to
be
a
very
clever
and
subtle
charlatan
who
affects
a
certain
profound
mysticism
in
order
to
give
himself
undue
importance
there
was
a
sudden
clash
harland
had
brought
his
clenched
fist
down
upon
the
table
with
a
force
that
made
the
glasses
ring
i
wo
have
that
brayle
he
said
sharply
i
tell
you
i
wo
have
it
santoris
is
no
charlatan
never
was
he
won
his
honours
at
oxford
like
a
man
his
conduct
all
the
time
i
ever
knew
him
was
perfectly
open
and
blameless
he
did
no
mean
tricks
and
pandered
to
nothing
base
and
if
some
of
us
fellows
were
frightened
of
him
as
we
were
it
was
because
he
did
everything
better
than
we
could
do
it
and
was
superior
to
us
all
that
the
truth
and
there
no
getting
over
it
nothing
gives
small
minds
a
better
handle
for
hatred
than
superiority
especially
when
that
superiority
is
never
asserted
but
only
felt
you
surprise
me
murmured
brayle
half
apologetically
i
thought
never
mind
what
you
thought
said
harland
with
a
sudden
ugly
irritation
of
manner
that
sometimes
disfigured
him
your
thoughts
are
not
of
the
least
importance
brayle
flushed
angrily
and
catherine
looked
surprised
and
visibly
indignant
father
how
can
you
be
so
rude
am
i
rude
and
harland
shrugged
his
shoulders
indifferently
well
i
may
be
but
i
never
take
a
man
hospitality
and
permit
myself
to
listen
to
abuse
of
him
afterwards
i
assure
you
began
brayle
almost
humbly
there
there
if
i
spoke
hastily
i
apologise
but
santoris
is
too
straightforward
a
man
to
be
suspected
of
any
dishonesty
or
chicanery
and
certainly
no
one
on
board
this
vessel
shall
treat
his
name
with
anything
but
respect
here
he
turned
to
me
will
you
come
on
deck
for
a
little
while
before
bedtime
or
would
you
rather
rest
i
saw
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
me
and
willingly
agreed
to
accompany
him
dinner
being
well
over
we
left
the
saloon
and
were
soon
pacing
the
deck
together
under
the
light
of
a
brilliant
moon
instinctively
we
both
looked
towards
the
yacht
there
was
no
illumination
about
her
this
evening
save
the
usual
lamp
hung
in
the
rigging
and
the
tiny
gleams
of
radiance
through
her
and
her
graceful
masts
and
spars
were
like
fine
black
pencillings
seen
against
the
bare
slope
of
a
mountain
made
almost
silver
to
the
summit
by
the
singularly
searching
clearness
of
the
moonbeams
my
host
paused
in
his
walk
beside
me
to
light
a
cigar
i
sure
you
are
convinced
that
santoris
is
honest
he
said
are
you
not
in
what
way
should
i
doubt
him
i
replied
evasively
i
scarcely
know
him
hardly
had
i
said
this
when
a
sudden
stung
me
how
dare
i
say
that
i
scarcely
knew
one
who
had
been
known
to
me
for
ages
i
leaned
against
the
deck
rail
looking
up
at
the
violet
sky
my
heart
beating
quickly
my
companion
was
still
busy
lighting
his
cigar
but
when
this
was
done
to
his
satisfaction
he
resumed
true
you
scarcely
know
him
but
you
are
quick
to
form
opinions
and
your
instincts
are
often
though
perhaps
not
always
correct
at
any
rate
you
have
no
distrust
of
him
you
like
him
yes
i
answered
slowly
i
i
like
him
very
much
and
the
violet
sky
with
its
round
white
moon
seemed
to
swing
in
a
circle
about
me
as
i
spoke
knowing
that
the
true
answer
of
my
heart
was
love
not
liking
that
love
was
the
magnet
drawing
me
irresistibly
despite
my
own
endeavour
to
something
i
could
neither
understand
nor
imagine
i
glad
of
that
said
harland
it
would
have
worried
me
a
little
if
you
had
taken
a
prejudice
or
felt
any
antipathy
towards
him
i
can
see
that
brayle
hates
him
and
has
imbued
catherine
with
something
of
his
own
dislike
i
was
silent
he
is
of
course
an
extraordinary
man
went
on
harland
and
he
is
bound
to
offend
many
and
to
please
few
he
is
not
likely
to
escape
the
usual
fate
of
unusual
characters
but
i
think
indeed
i
may
say
i
am
sure
his
integrity
is
beyond
question
he
has
curious
opinions
about
love
and
marriage
almost
as
curious
as
the
fixed
ideas
he
holds
concerning
life
and
death
something
cold
seemed
to
send
a
shiver
through
my
blood
was
it
some
stray
fragment
of
memory
from
the
past
that
stirred
me
to
a
sense
of
pain
i
forced
myself
to
speak
what
are
those
opinions
i
asked
and
looking
up
in
the
moonlight
to
my
companion
face
i
saw
that
it
wore
a
puzzled
expression
hardly
conventional
i
suppose
conventional
convention
and
santoris
are
farther
apart
than
the
poles
no
he
does
fit
into
any
accepted
social
code
at
all
he
looks
upon
marriage
itself
as
a
tacit
acknowledgment
of
inconstancy
in
love
and
declares
that
if
the
passion
existed
in
its
truest
form
between
man
and
woman
any
sort
of
formal
or
legal
tie
would
be
needless
as
love
if
it
be
love
does
not
and
can
not
change
but
it
is
no
use
discussing
such
a
matter
with
him
the
love
that
he
believes
in
can
only
exist
if
then
once
in
a
thousand
years
men
and
women
marry
for
physical
attraction
convenience
necessity
or
respectability
and
the
legal
bond
is
necessary
both
for
their
sakes
and
the
worldly
welfare
of
the
children
born
to
them
but
love
which
is
physical
and
transcendental
together
love
that
is
to
last
through
an
imagined
eternity
of
progress
and
fruition
this
is
a
mere
dream
a
chimera
and
he
feasts
his
brain
upon
it
as
though
it
were
a
nourishing
fact
however
one
must
have
patience
with
him
he
is
not
like
the
rest
of
us
no
i
murmured
and
then
stood
silently
beside
him
watching
the
moonbeams
ripple
on
the
waters
in
wavy
links
of
brightness
when
you
married
i
said
at
last
did
you
not
marry
for
love
he
puffed
at
his
cigar
thoughtfully
well
i
hardly
know
he
replied
after
a
long
pause
looking
back
upon
everything
i
rather
doubt
it
i
married
as
most
men
marry
on
impulse
i
saw
a
pretty
face
and
it
seemed
advisable
that
i
should
marry
but
i
can
not
say
i
was
moved
by
any
great
or
absorbing
passion
for
the
woman
i
chose
she
was
charming
and
amiable
in
our
courting
days
as
a
wife
she
became
peevish
and
querulous
apt
to
sulk
too
and
she
devoted
herself
almost
entirely
to
the
most
commonplace
routine
of
life
however
i
had
nothing
to
justly
complain
of
we
lived
five
years
together
before
her
child
catherine
was
born
and
then
she
died
i
can
not
say
that
either
her
life
or
her
death
left
any
deep
mark
upon
me
not
if
i
am
honest
i
do
think
i
understand
love
certainly
not
the
love
which
rafel
santoris
looks
upon
as
the
secret
key
of
the
universe
instinctively
my
eyes
turned
towards
the
at
anchor
she
looked
like
a
phantom
vessel
in
the
moonlight
again
the
faint
shiver
of
cold
ran
through
my
veins
like
a
sense
of
spiritual
terror
if
i
should
lose
now
what
i
had
lost
before
this
was
my
chief
thought
my
hidden
shuddering
fear
did
the
whole
responsibility
rest
with
me
i
wondered
harland
laid
his
hand
kindly
on
my
arm
you
look
like
a
wan
spirit
in
the
moonbeams
he
said
so
pale
and
wistful
you
are
tired
and
i
am
selfish
in
keeping
you
up
here
to
talk
to
me
go
down
to
your
cabin
i
can
see
you
are
full
of
mystical
dreams
and
i
am
afraid
santoris
has
rather
helped
you
to
indulge
in
them
he
is
of
the
same
nature
as
you
are
inclined
to
believe
that
this
life
as
we
live
it
is
only
one
phase
of
many
that
are
past
and
of
many
yet
to
come
i
wish
i
could
accept
that
faith
i
wish
you
could
i
said
you
surely
would
be
happier
should
i
he
gave
a
quick
sigh
i
have
my
doubts
if
i
could
be
young
and
strong
and
lie
through
many
lives
always
possessed
of
that
same
youth
and
strength
then
there
would
be
something
in
it
but
to
be
old
and
ailing
no
the
faust
legend
is
an
eternal
truth
life
is
only
worth
living
as
long
as
we
enjoy
it
your
friend
santoris
enjoys
it
i
said
ah
there
you
touch
me
he
does
enjoy
it
and
why
because
he
is
young
though
nearly
as
old
in
years
as
i
am
he
is
actually
young
that
the
mystery
of
him
santoris
is
positively
young
young
in
heart
young
in
thought
ambition
feeling
and
sentiment
and
yet
he
broke
off
for
a
moment
then
resumed
i
do
know
how
he
has
managed
it
but
he
told
me
long
ago
that
it
was
a
man
own
fault
if
he
allowed
himself
to
grow
old
i
laughed
at
him
then
but
he
has
certainly
carried
his
theories
into
fact
he
used
to
declare
that
it
was
either
yourself
or
your
friends
that
made
you
old
will
find
he
said
you
go
on
in
years
that
your
family
relations
or
your
professing
dear
friends
are
those
that
will
chiefly
insist
on
your
inviting
and
accepting
the
burden
of
age
they
will
remind
you
that
twenty
years
ago
you
did
so
and
so
or
that
they
have
known
you
over
thirty
years
or
they
will
tell
you
that
considering
your
age
you
look
well
or
a
thousand
and
one
things
of
that
kind
as
if
it
were
a
fault
or
even
a
crime
to
be
alive
for
a
certain
span
of
time
whereas
if
you
simply
shook
off
such
unnecessary
attentions
and
went
your
own
way
taking
freely
of
the
constant
output
of
life
and
energy
supplied
to
you
by
nature
you
would
outwit
all
these
croakers
of
feebleness
and
decay
and
renew
your
vital
forces
to
the
end
but
to
do
this
you
must
have
a
constant
aim
in
life
and
a
ruling
passion
as
i
told
you
i
laughed
at
him
and
at
what
i
called
his
but
now
well
now
it
a
case
of
those
laugh
who
win
and
you
think
he
has
won
i
asked
most
assuredly
i
can
not
deny
it
but
the
secret
of
his
victory
is
beyond
me
i
should
think
it
is
beyond
most
people
i
replied
for
if
we
could
all
keep
ourselves
young
and
strong
we
would
take
every
means
in
our
power
to
attain
such
happiness
would
we
though
and
his
brows
knitted
perplexedly
if
we
knew
would
we
take
the
necessary
trouble
we
will
hardly
obey
a
orders
for
our
good
even
when
we
are
really
ill
would
we
in
health
follow
any
code
of
life
in
order
to
keep
well
i
laughed
perhaps
not
i
said
i
expect
it
will
always
be
the
same
thing
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
goodnight
i
held
out
my
hand
he
took
it
in
his
own
and
kept
it
a
moment
it
curious
we
should
have
met
santoris
so
soon
after
my
telling
you
about
him
he
said
it
one
of
those
coincidences
which
one
can
not
explain
you
are
very
like
him
in
some
of
your
ideas
you
two
ought
to
be
very
great
friends
ought
we
and
i
smiled
perhaps
we
shall
be
again
and
i
left
him
to
his
meditations
and
went
down
to
my
cabin
only
stopping
for
a
moment
to
say
to
catherine
and
brayle
who
were
playing
bridge
with
swinton
and
captain
derrick
in
the
saloon
once
in
my
room
i
was
thankful
to
be
alone
every
extraneous
thing
seemed
an
intrusion
or
an
impertinence
the
thoughts
that
filled
my
brain
were
all
absorbing
and
went
so
far
beyond
the
immediate
radius
of
time
and
space
that
i
could
hardly
follow
their
flight
i
smiled
as
i
imagined
what
ordinary
people
would
think
of
the
experience
through
which
i
had
passed
and
was
passing
fancies
folly
and
other
epithets
of
the
kind
would
be
heaped
upon
me
if
they
knew
they
the
excellent
folk
whose
sole
objects
in
life
are
so
ephemeral
as
to
be
the
things
of
the
hour
the
day
or
the
month
merely
and
who
if
they
ever
pause
to
consider
eternal
possibilities
at
all
do
so
reluctantly
perhaps
in
church
on
sundays
comfortably
dismissing
them
for
the
more
solid
prospect
of
dinner
and
of
love
what
view
of
the
divine
passion
do
they
take
as
a
rule
let
the
millions
of
mistaken
marriages
answer
let
the
savage
lusts
and
treacheries
and
cruelties
of
merely
brutish
and
unspiritualised
humanity
bear
witness
and
how
few
shall
be
found
who
have
even
the
beginnings
of
the
nature
of
true
love
love
of
soul
for
soul
angel
for
angel
god
for
god
the
love
that
accepts
this
world
and
its
events
as
one
phase
only
of
divine
and
immortal
existence
a
phase
of
trial
and
proving
in
which
the
greater
number
fail
to
pass
even
a
first
examination
as
for
myself
i
felt
and
knew
that
had
failed
hopelessly
and
utterly
in
the
past
and
i
stood
now
as
it
were
on
the
edge
of
new
circumstances
in
fear
yet
not
without
hope
and
praying
that
whatsoever
should
chance
to
me
i
might
not
fail
again
x
strange
associations
the
next
day
the
race
agreed
upon
was
run
in
the
calmest
of
calm
weather
there
was
not
the
faintest
breath
of
wind
the
sea
was
still
as
a
pond
and
almost
oily
in
its
smooth
motionless
shining
and
it
was
evident
at
first
that
our
captain
entertained
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
the
with
her
powerful
engines
being
easily
able
to
beat
the
schooner
which
at
with
all
sails
spread
came
gliding
up
beside
us
till
she
lay
point
to
point
at
equal
distance
and
at
nearly
equal
measurement
with
our
more
cumbersome
vessel
harland
was
keenly
excited
brayle
was
ready
to
lay
any
amount
of
wagers
as
to
the
impossibility
of
a
sailing
vessel
even
granted
she
was
moved
by
electricity
one
of
steam
in
such
a
dead
calm
as
the
two
vessels
lay
on
the
still
waters
the
fussily
getting
up
steam
and
the
with
sails
full
out
as
if
in
a
stiff
breeze
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
no
wind
we
discussed
the
situation
eagerly
or
rather
i
should
say
my
host
and
his
people
discussed
it
for
i
had
nothing
to
say
knowing
that
the
victory
was
sure
to
be
with
santoris
we
were
in
very
lonely
waters
there
was
room
and
to
spare
for
plenty
of
racing
and
when
all
was
ready
and
santoris
saluted
us
from
the
deck
lifting
his
cap
and
waving
it
in
response
to
a
similar
greeting
from
harland
and
our
skipper
the
signal
to
start
was
given
we
moved
off
together
and
for
at
least
half
an
hour
or
more
the
floated
along
in
a
kind
of
lazy
indolence
keeping
up
with
us
easily
her
canvas
filled
and
her
keel
cutting
the
water
as
if
swept
by
a
favouring
gale
the
result
of
the
race
was
soon
a
foregone
conclusion
for
presently
when
well
out
on
the
calm
of
the
sea
the
showed
her
secret
powers
in
earnest
and
flew
like
a
bird
with
a
silent
swiftness
that
was
almost
incredible
our
yacht
put
on
all
steam
in
the
effort
to
keep
up
with
her
in
vain
on
on
with
light
grace
and
celerity
her
white
sails
carried
her
like
the
wings
of
a
and
almost
before
we
could
realise
it
she
vanished
altogether
from
our
sight
i
saw
a
waste
of
water
spread
around
us
emptily
like
a
wide
circle
of
crystal
reflecting
the
sky
and
a
sense
of
desolation
fell
upon
me
in
the
mere
fact
that
we
were
temporarily
left
alone
we
steamed
on
and
on
in
the
direction
of
the
vanished
our
movements
suggesting
those
of
some
clumsy
animal
panting
its
way
after
a
bird
but
unable
to
come
up
with
her
wonderful
said
harland
at
last
drawing
a
long
breath
i
would
never
have
believed
it
possible
nor
i
agreed
captain
derrick
i
certainly
thought
she
would
never
have
managed
it
in
such
a
dead
calm
for
though
i
have
seen
some
of
her
mechanism
i
can
not
entirely
understand
it
brayle
was
silent
it
was
evident
that
he
was
annoyed
though
why
he
should
be
so
was
not
apparent
i
myself
was
full
of
secret
anxiety
for
the
yacht
sudden
and
swift
disappearance
had
filled
me
with
a
wretched
sense
of
loneliness
beyond
all
expression
suppose
she
should
not
return
i
had
no
clue
to
her
whereabouts
and
with
the
loss
of
santoris
i
knew
i
should
lose
all
that
was
worth
having
in
my
life
while
these
miserable
thoughts
were
yet
chasing
each
other
through
my
brain
i
suddenly
caught
a
far
glimpse
of
white
sails
on
the
horizon
she
coming
back
i
cried
enraptured
and
heedless
of
what
i
said
oh
thank
god
she
coming
back
they
all
looked
at
me
in
amazement
why
what
the
matter
with
you
asked
harland
smiling
you
surely
did
think
she
was
in
any
danger
my
cheeks
grew
warm
i
did
know
i
could
not
imagine
i
faltered
and
turning
away
i
met
brayle
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
a
gleam
of
malice
in
them
i
sure
he
said
suavely
you
are
greatly
interested
in
santoris
perhaps
you
have
met
each
other
before
never
i
answered
hurriedly
and
then
checked
myself
startled
and
confused
he
kept
his
narrow
brown
eyes
heedfully
upon
me
and
smiled
slightly
really
i
should
have
thought
otherwise
i
did
not
trouble
myself
to
reply
the
white
sails
of
the
were
coming
nearer
and
nearer
over
the
smooth
width
of
the
sunlit
water
and
as
she
approached
my
heart
grew
warm
with
gratitude
life
was
again
a
thing
of
joy
the
world
was
no
longer
empty
that
ship
looked
to
me
like
a
beautiful
winged
spirit
coming
towards
me
with
radiant
assurances
of
hope
and
consolation
and
i
lost
all
fear
all
sadness
all
foreboding
as
she
gradually
swept
up
alongside
in
the
easy
triumph
she
had
won
our
crew
assembled
to
welcome
her
and
cheered
lustily
santoris
standing
on
her
deck
lightly
acknowledged
the
salutes
which
gave
him
the
victory
and
presently
both
our
vessels
were
once
more
at
their
former
places
of
anchorage
when
all
the
excitement
was
over
i
went
down
to
my
cabin
to
rest
for
a
while
before
dressing
for
the
dinner
on
board
the
to
which
we
were
all
invited
and
while
i
lay
on
my
sofa
reading
catherine
harland
knocked
at
my
door
and
asked
to
come
in
i
admitted
her
at
once
and
she
flung
herself
into
an
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
i
so
tired
of
all
this
yachting
she
said
peevishly
it
amusing
to
me
i
very
sorry
i
answered
if
you
feel
like
that
why
not
give
it
up
at
once
oh
it
father
whim
she
and
if
he
makes
up
his
mind
no
moving
him
one
thing
however
i
determined
to
do
and
that
is
here
she
stopped
looking
at
me
curiously
i
returned
her
gaze
questioningly
and
that
is
what
to
get
as
far
away
as
ever
we
can
from
that
terrible
yacht
and
its
owner
she
replied
that
man
is
a
devil
i
laughed
i
could
not
help
laughing
the
estimate
she
had
formed
of
one
so
vastly
her
superior
as
santoris
struck
me
as
more
amusing
than
blamable
i
am
often
accustomed
to
hear
the
hasty
and
narrow
verdict
of
and
unintelligent
persons
pronounced
on
men
and
women
of
high
attainment
and
great
mental
ability
therefore
that
she
should
show
herself
as
not
above
the
level
of
the
common
majority
did
not
offend
so
much
as
it
entertained
me
however
my
laughter
made
her
suddenly
angry
why
do
you
laugh
she
demanded
you
look
quite
pagan
in
that
lace
i
suppose
you
call
it
a
restgown
with
all
your
hair
tumbling
loose
about
you
and
that
laugh
of
yours
is
a
pagan
laugh
i
was
so
surprised
at
her
odd
way
of
speaking
that
for
a
moment
i
could
find
no
words
she
looked
at
me
with
a
kind
of
hard
disfavour
in
her
eyes
that
the
reason
she
went
on
why
you
find
life
agreeable
pagans
always
did
they
revelled
in
sunshine
and
open
air
and
found
all
sorts
of
excuses
for
their
own
faults
provided
they
got
some
pleasure
out
of
them
that
quite
your
temperament
and
they
laughed
at
serious
things
just
as
you
do
the
mirror
showed
me
my
own
reflection
and
i
saw
myself
still
smiling
do
i
laugh
at
serious
things
i
said
dear
miss
harland
i
am
not
aware
of
it
but
i
can
not
take
santoris
as
a
seriously
he
is
and
she
nodded
her
head
emphatically
and
all
those
queer
beliefs
he
holds
and
you
hold
them
too
are
devilish
if
you
belonged
to
the
church
of
rome
you
would
not
be
allowed
to
indulge
in
such
wicked
theories
for
a
moment
ah
the
church
of
rome
fortunately
can
not
control
thought
i
said
not
even
the
thoughts
of
its
own
children
and
some
of
the
beliefs
of
the
church
of
rome
are
more
blasphemous
and
barbarous
than
all
the
paganism
of
the
ancient
world
tell
me
what
are
my
theories
oh
i
do
know
she
replied
vaguely
and
inconsequently
you
believe
there
no
death
and
you
think
we
all
make
our
own
illnesses
and
misfortunes
and
i
heard
you
say
that
the
idea
of
eternal
punishment
is
absurd
so
in
a
way
you
are
as
bad
as
father
who
declares
there
nothing
in
the
universe
but
gas
and
atoms
no
god
and
no
anything
you
really
are
quite
as
much
of
an
atheist
as
he
is
brayle
says
so
i
had
been
standing
in
front
of
her
while
she
thus
talked
but
now
i
resumed
my
former
reclining
attitude
on
the
sofa
and
looked
at
her
with
a
touch
of
disdain
brayle
says
so
i
repeated
brayle
opinion
is
the
least
worth
having
in
the
world
now
if
you
really
believe
in
devils
there
one
for
you
how
can
you
say
so
she
exclaimed
hotly
what
right
have
you
how
can
he
call
me
an
atheist
i
what
right
has
he
to
judge
me
the
flush
died
off
her
face
and
a
sudden
fear
filled
her
eyes
do
look
at
me
like
that
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
it
reminds
me
of
an
awful
dream
i
had
the
other
night
she
shall
i
tell
it
to
you
i
nodded
indifferently
yet
watched
her
curiously
the
while
something
in
her
hard
plain
face
had
become
suddenly
and
unpleasantly
familiar
i
dreamed
that
i
was
in
a
painter
studio
watching
two
murdered
people
die
a
man
and
a
woman
the
man
was
like
santoris
the
woman
resembled
you
they
had
been
stabbed
and
the
woman
was
clinging
to
the
man
body
brayle
stood
beside
me
also
watching
but
the
scene
was
strange
to
me
and
the
clothes
we
wore
were
all
of
some
ancient
time
i
said
to
brayle
have
killed
them
and
he
replied
they
are
better
dead
than
living
it
was
a
horrible
dream
it
seemed
so
real
i
have
been
frightened
of
you
and
of
that
man
santoris
ever
since
i
could
not
speak
for
a
moment
a
recollection
swept
over
me
to
which
i
dared
not
give
utterance
it
seemed
too
improbable
i
had
nerves
she
went
on
shivering
a
little
and
that
why
i
say
i
tired
of
this
yachting
trip
it
becoming
a
nightmare
to
me
i
lay
back
on
the
sofa
looking
at
her
with
a
kind
of
pity
then
why
not
end
it
i
said
or
why
not
let
me
go
away
it
is
i
who
have
displeased
you
somehow
and
i
assure
you
i
very
sorry
you
and
harland
have
both
been
most
kind
to
me
i
been
your
guest
for
nearly
a
fortnight
that
quite
sufficient
holiday
for
me
put
me
ashore
anywhere
you
like
and
i
go
home
and
get
myself
out
of
your
way
will
that
be
any
comfort
to
you
i
do
know
that
it
will
she
said
with
a
short
querulous
sigh
things
have
happened
so
strangely
she
paused
looking
at
me
yes
you
have
the
face
of
that
woman
i
saw
in
my
dream
and
you
have
always
reminded
me
of
i
waited
eagerly
she
seemed
afraid
to
go
on
well
i
said
as
quietly
as
i
could
do
please
finish
what
you
were
saying
it
goes
back
to
the
time
when
i
first
saw
you
she
continued
now
speaking
quickly
as
though
anxious
to
get
it
over
you
will
perhaps
hardly
remember
the
occasion
it
was
at
that
great
art
and
society
crush
in
london
where
there
was
such
a
crowd
that
hundreds
of
people
never
got
farther
than
the
staircase
you
were
pointed
out
to
me
as
a
psychist
and
while
i
was
still
listening
to
what
was
being
said
about
you
my
father
came
up
with
you
on
his
arm
and
introduced
us
when
i
saw
you
i
felt
that
your
features
were
somehow
familiar
though
i
could
not
tell
where
i
had
met
you
before
and
i
became
very
anxious
to
see
more
of
you
in
fact
you
had
a
perfect
fascination
for
me
you
have
the
same
fascination
now
only
it
is
a
fascination
that
terrifies
me
i
was
silent
the
other
night
she
went
on
when
santoris
first
came
on
board
i
had
a
singular
impression
that
he
was
or
had
been
an
enemy
of
mine
though
where
or
how
i
could
not
say
it
was
this
that
frightened
me
and
made
me
too
ill
and
nervous
to
go
with
you
on
that
excursion
to
loch
coruisk
and
i
want
to
get
away
from
him
i
never
had
such
impressions
before
and
even
now
looking
at
you
i
feel
something
in
you
which
is
quite
uncanny
it
troubles
me
oh
sure
you
mean
me
no
harm
you
are
bright
and
amiable
and
adaptable
and
all
that
but
i
afraid
of
you
poor
catherine
i
said
very
gently
these
are
merely
nervous
ideas
there
is
nothing
to
fear
from
me
no
nothing
for
here
she
suddenly
leaned
forward
and
took
my
hand
looking
earnestly
in
my
face
how
can
you
imagine
such
a
thing
possible
are
you
sure
she
half
whispered
when
i
called
you
pagan
just
now
i
had
a
sort
of
dim
recollection
of
a
fair
woman
like
you
a
woman
i
seemed
to
know
who
was
really
a
pagan
yet
i
do
know
how
i
knew
her
or
where
i
met
her
a
woman
who
for
some
reason
or
other
was
hateful
to
me
because
i
was
jealous
of
her
these
curious
fancies
have
haunted
my
mind
only
since
that
man
santoris
came
on
board
and
i
told
brayle
exactly
what
i
felt
and
what
did
he
say
i
asked
he
said
that
it
was
all
the
work
of
santoris
who
was
an
evident
professor
of
psychical
imposture
i
sprang
up
let
him
say
that
to
me
i
exclaimed
let
him
dare
to
say
it
and
i
will
prove
who
is
the
impostor
to
his
face
she
retreated
from
me
with
eyes
of
alarm
why
do
you
look
at
me
like
that
she
said
we
did
really
kill
you
except
in
a
dream
a
sudden
silence
fell
between
us
something
cold
and
shadowy
and
impalpable
seemed
to
possess
the
very
air
if
by
some
supernatural
agency
we
had
been
momentarily
deprived
of
life
and
motion
while
a
vast
dark
cloud
heavy
with
rain
had
made
its
slow
way
betwixt
us
the
sense
of
chill
and
depression
could
hardly
have
been
greater
presently
catherine
spoke
again
with
a
little
forced
laugh
what
silly
things
i
say
she
murmured
you
can
see
for
yourself
my
nerves
are
in
a
bad
state
i
am
altogether
unstrung
i
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
her
and
considering
the
perplexity
in
which
we
both
seemed
involved
if
you
would
rather
not
dine
with
santoris
this
evening
i
said
at
last
and
if
you
think
his
presence
has
a
bad
effect
on
you
let
us
make
some
excuse
not
to
go
i
will
willingly
stay
with
you
if
you
wish
me
to
do
so
she
gave
me
a
surprised
glance
you
are
very
unselfish
she
said
and
i
wish
i
were
not
so
fanciful
it
most
kind
of
you
to
offer
to
stay
with
me
and
to
give
up
an
evening
pleasure
for
i
suppose
it
is
a
pleasure
you
like
mr
santoris
the
colour
rushed
to
my
face
in
a
warm
glow
yes
i
answered
turning
slightly
away
from
her
i
like
him
very
much
and
he
likes
you
better
than
he
likes
any
of
us
she
said
in
fact
i
believe
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
we
should
never
have
met
him
in
this
strange
way
why
how
can
you
make
that
out
i
asked
smiling
i
never
heard
of
him
till
your
father
spoke
of
him
and
never
saw
him
till
till
when
she
demanded
quickly
till
the
other
night
i
answered
hesitatingly
she
searched
my
face
with
questioning
eyes
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that
you
like
myself
had
some
idea
or
recollection
of
having
met
him
before
she
said
however
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
sacrifice
your
pleasure
for
me
in
fact
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
this
dinner
though
brayle
does
wish
it
oh
brayle
does
wish
it
i
echoed
and
why
well
he
thinks
it
will
not
be
good
for
me
and
and
he
hates
the
very
sight
of
santoris
i
said
nothing
she
rose
to
leave
my
cabin
please
do
think
too
hardly
of
me
she
said
pleadingly
told
you
frankly
just
how
i
feel
and
you
can
imagine
how
glad
i
shall
be
when
this
yachting
trip
comes
to
an
end
she
went
away
then
and
i
stood
for
some
minutes
lost
in
thought
i
dared
not
pursue
the
train
of
memories
with
which
she
had
connected
herself
in
my
mind
my
chief
idea
now
was
to
find
some
convenient
method
of
immediately
concluding
my
stay
with
the
harlands
and
leaving
their
yacht
at
some
easy
point
of
departure
for
home
and
i
resolved
i
would
speak
to
santoris
on
this
subject
and
trust
to
him
for
a
means
whereby
we
should
not
lose
sight
of
each
other
for
i
felt
that
this
was
imperative
and
my
spirit
rose
up
within
me
full
of
joy
and
pride
in
its
instinctive
consciousness
that
i
was
as
necessary
to
him
as
he
was
to
me
it
was
a
warm
almost
sultry
evening
and
i
was
able
to
discard
my
serge
yachting
dress
for
one
of
soft
white
indian
silk
a
cooler
and
more
presentable
costume
for
a
on
board
a
yacht
which
was
furnished
with
such
luxury
as
was
the
my
little
sprig
of
still
looked
bright
and
fresh
in
the
glass
where
i
always
kept
it
but
when
i
took
it
in
my
hand
it
suddenly
crumbled
into
a
pinch
of
fine
grey
dust
this
sudden
destruction
of
what
had
seemed
indestructible
startled
me
for
a
moment
till
i
began
to
think
that
after
all
the
little
bunch
of
blossom
had
done
its
work
its
message
had
been
given
its
errand
completed
all
the
madonna
lilies
santoris
had
given
me
were
as
fresh
as
if
newly
gathered
and
i
chose
one
of
these
with
its
companion
bud
as
my
only
ornament
when
i
joined
my
host
and
his
party
in
the
saloon
he
looked
at
me
with
inquisitive
scrutiny
i
can
not
quite
make
you
out
he
said
you
look
several
years
younger
than
you
did
when
you
came
on
board
at
rothesay
is
it
the
sea
air
the
sunshine
or
santoris
santoris
i
repeated
and
laughed
how
can
it
be
santoris
well
he
makes
himself
young
harland
answered
and
perhaps
he
may
make
others
young
too
there
no
telling
the
extent
of
his
powers
quite
the
conjurer
observed
brayle
drily
faust
should
have
consulted
him
instead
of
mephistopheles
is
a
wonderful
legend
but
absurd
in
the
fact
that
the
old
philosopher
sold
his
soul
to
the
devil
merely
for
the
love
of
woman
said
harland
the
joy
the
sensation
and
the
passion
of
love
were
to
him
supreme
temptation
and
the
only
satisfaction
on
earth
brayle
eyes
gleamed
but
after
all
is
this
not
a
truth
he
asked
is
there
anything
that
so
completely
dominates
the
life
of
a
man
as
the
love
of
a
woman
it
is
very
seldom
the
right
woman
but
it
is
always
a
woman
of
some
kind
everything
that
has
ever
been
done
in
the
world
either
good
or
evil
can
be
traced
back
to
the
influence
of
women
on
men
sometimes
it
is
their
wives
who
sway
their
actions
but
it
is
far
more
often
their
mistresses
kings
and
emperors
are
as
prone
to
the
universal
weakness
as
commoners
we
have
only
to
read
history
to
be
assured
of
the
fact
what
more
could
faust
desire
than
love
well
to
me
love
is
a
mistake
said
harland
throwing
on
his
overcoat
carelessly
i
agree
with
byron
dictum
loves
raves
of
course
it
should
be
an
ideal
passion
but
it
never
is
come
are
we
all
ready
we
were
and
we
at
once
left
the
yacht
in
our
own
launch
our
party
consisted
of
harland
his
daughter
myself
brayle
and
swinton
and
with
such
indifferent
companions
i
imagined
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
get
even
a
moment
with
santoris
alone
to
tell
him
of
my
intention
to
leave
my
host
and
hostess
as
soon
as
might
be
possible
however
i
determined
to
make
some
effort
in
this
direction
if
i
could
find
even
the
briefest
opportunity
we
made
our
little
trip
across
the
water
from
the
to
the
in
the
light
of
a
magnificent
sunset
loch
scavaig
was
a
blaze
of
burning
colour
and
the
skies
above
us
were
flushed
with
deep
rose
divided
by
lines
of
palest
blue
and
warm
gold
santoris
was
waiting
on
the
deck
to
receive
us
attended
by
his
captain
and
one
or
two
of
the
principals
of
the
crew
but
what
attracted
and
charmed
our
eyes
at
the
moment
was
a
beautiful
dark
youth
of
some
twelve
or
thirteen
years
of
age
clad
in
eastern
dress
who
held
a
basket
full
of
crimson
and
white
rose
petals
which
with
a
graceful
gesture
he
silently
emptied
at
our
feet
as
we
stepped
on
board
i
happened
to
be
the
first
one
to
ascend
the
companion
ladder
so
that
it
looked
as
if
this
fragrant
heap
of
delicate
leaves
had
been
thrown
down
for
me
to
tread
upon
but
even
if
it
had
been
so
intended
it
appeared
as
though
designed
for
the
whole
party
santoris
welcomed
us
with
the
kindly
courtesy
which
always
distinguished
his
manner
and
he
himself
escorted
miss
harland
down
to
one
of
the
cabins
there
to
take
off
the
numerous
unnecessary
wraps
and
shawls
with
which
she
invariably
clothed
herself
on
the
warmest
day
i
followed
them
as
they
went
and
he
turned
to
me
with
a
smile
saying
you
know
your
room
the
same
you
had
yesterday
afternoon
i
obeyed
his
gesture
and
entered
the
exquisitely
designed
and
furnished
apartment
which
he
had
said
was
for
a
and
closing
the
door
i
sat
down
for
a
few
minutes
to
think
quietly
it
was
evident
that
things
were
coming
to
some
sort
of
crisis
in
my
life
and
shaping
to
some
destiny
which
i
must
either
accept
or
avoid
decisive
action
would
rest
as
i
saw
entirely
with
myself
to
avoid
all
difficulty
i
had
only
to
hold
my
peace
and
go
my
own
way
refuse
to
know
more
of
this
singular
man
who
seemed
to
be
so
mysteriously
connected
with
my
life
and
return
home
to
the
usual
safe
if
dull
routine
of
my
ordinary
round
of
work
and
effort
on
the
other
hand
to
accept
the
dawning
joy
that
seemed
showering
upon
me
like
a
light
from
heaven
was
to
blindly
move
on
into
the
unknown
to
trust
unquestioningly
to
the
secret
spiritual
promptings
of
my
own
nature
and
to
give
myself
up
wholly
and
ungrudgingly
to
a
love
which
suggested
all
things
yet
promised
nothing
full
of
the
most
conflicting
thoughts
i
paced
the
room
up
and
down
slowly
the
tall
mirror
reflected
my
face
and
figure
and
showed
me
the
startlingly
faithful
presentment
of
the
woman
i
had
seen
in
my
strange
series
of
visions
the
woman
who
centuries
ago
had
fought
against
convention
and
custom
only
to
be
foolishly
conquered
by
them
in
a
thousand
ways
the
woman
who
had
slain
love
only
that
it
should
rise
again
and
confront
her
with
deathless
eyes
of
eternal
remembrance
the
woman
who
drowned
at
last
for
love
sake
in
a
sea
of
wrath
and
trembling
knelt
outside
the
barred
gate
of
heaven
praying
to
enter
in
and
in
my
mind
i
heard
again
the
words
spoken
by
that
sweet
and
solemn
voice
which
had
addressed
me
in
the
first
of
my
dreams
one
rose
from
all
the
roses
in
heaven
one
fadeless
and
immortal
only
one
but
sufficient
for
all
one
love
from
all
the
million
loves
of
men
and
women
one
but
enough
for
eternity
how
long
the
rose
has
awaited
its
flowering
how
long
the
love
has
awaited
its
fulfilment
only
the
recording
angels
know
such
roses
bloom
but
once
in
the
wilderness
of
space
and
time
such
love
comes
but
once
in
a
universe
of
worlds
and
then
i
remembered
the
parting
command
rise
and
go
hence
keep
the
gift
god
sends
thee
take
that
which
is
thine
meet
that
which
hath
sought
thee
sorrowing
for
many
centuries
turn
not
aside
again
neither
by
thine
own
will
nor
by
the
will
of
others
lest
old
errors
prevail
pass
from
vision
into
waking
from
night
to
day
from
seeming
death
to
life
from
loneliness
to
love
and
keep
within
thy
heart
the
message
of
a
dream
dared
i
trust
to
these
suggestions
which
the
would
call
mere
imagination
a
profound
philosopher
of
these
latter
days
has
defined
imagination
as
advanced
perception
of
truth
and
avers
that
the
discoveries
of
the
future
can
always
be
predicted
by
the
poet
and
the
seer
whose
receptive
brains
are
the
first
to
catch
the
premonitions
of
those
finer
issues
of
thought
which
emanate
from
the
divine
intelligence
however
this
may
be
my
own
experience
of
life
had
taught
me
that
what
ordinary
persons
pin
their
faith
upon
as
real
is
often
unreal
while
such
promptings
of
the
soul
as
are
almost
incapable
of
expression
lead
to
the
highest
realities
of
existence
and
i
decided
at
last
to
let
matters
take
their
own
course
though
i
was
absolutely
resolved
to
get
away
from
the
harlands
within
the
next
two
or
three
days
i
meant
to
ask
harland
to
land
me
at
portree
where
i
could
take
the
steamer
for
glasgow
any
excuse
would
serve
for
a
hurried
departure
and
i
felt
now
that
departure
was
necessary
a
soft
sound
of
musical
bells
reached
my
ears
at
this
moment
announcing
dinner
and
leaving
the
apartment
i
met
santoris
at
the
entrance
to
the
saloon
there
was
no
one
else
there
for
the
moment
but
himself
and
as
i
came
towards
him
he
took
my
hands
in
his
own
and
raised
them
to
his
lips
you
are
not
yet
resolved
he
said
in
a
low
tone
smiling
take
plenty
of
time
i
lifted
my
eyes
to
his
and
all
doubt
seemed
swept
away
in
the
light
of
our
mutual
glances
i
smiled
in
response
to
his
look
and
we
loosened
our
hands
quickly
as
harland
with
his
doctor
and
secretary
came
down
from
the
deck
catherine
joining
us
from
the
cabin
where
she
had
disburdened
herself
of
her
invalid
wrappings
she
was
rather
more
elegantly
attired
than
usual
she
wore
a
curious
gown
with
threads
of
gold
interwoven
in
the
stuff
and
a
collar
of
lace
turned
back
at
the
throat
gave
her
the
aspect
of
an
old
italian
picture
a
sort
of
of
a
lady
artist
unknown
not
a
pleasant
portrait
perhaps
but
characteristic
of
a
certain
dull
and
type
of
woman
we
were
soon
seated
at
table
a
table
richly
yet
daintily
appointed
and
adorned
with
the
costliest
flowers
and
fruits
the
men
who
waited
upon
us
were
all
easterns
and
and
wore
the
eastern
dress
all
their
movements
were
swift
yet
graceful
and
dignified
they
made
no
noise
in
the
business
of
serving
not
a
dish
clattered
not
a
glass
clashed
they
were
perfect
servants
taking
care
to
avoid
the
common
but
reprehensible
method
of
offering
dishes
to
persons
conversing
thus
interrupting
the
flow
of
talk
at
inopportune
moments
and
what
talk
it
was
all
sorts
of
subjects
social
and
impersonal
came
up
for
discussion
and
santoris
handled
them
with
such
skill
that
he
made
us
forget
that
there
was
anything
remarkable
or
unusual
about
himself
or
his
surroundings
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
more
princely
banquet
could
ever
have
been
served
in
the
most
luxurious
of
palaces
through
the
meal
when
the
conversation
came
for
a
moment
to
a
pause
the
most
exquisite
music
charmed
our
ears
beginning
softly
and
far
away
it
swelled
out
to
rich
and
glorious
harmonies
like
a
full
orchestra
playing
under
the
sea
we
looked
at
each
other
and
then
at
our
host
in
charmed
enquiry
electricity
again
he
said
so
simply
managed
that
it
is
not
worth
talking
about
unfortunately
it
is
mechanical
music
and
this
can
never
be
like
the
music
evolved
from
brain
and
fingers
however
it
fills
in
gaps
of
silence
when
conventional
minds
are
at
a
strain
for
something
to
say
something
quite
and
unlikely
to
provoke
discussion
his
keen
blue
eyes
flashed
with
a
sudden
gleam
of
scorn
in
them
i
looked
at
him
half
questioningly
and
the
scorn
melted
into
a
smile
it
is
good
form
to
start
any
subject
which
might
lead
to
argument
he
went
on
the
modern
brain
must
not
be
exercised
too
strenuously
it
is
not
strong
enough
to
stand
much
effort
what
do
you
say
harland
i
agree
answered
harland
as
a
rule
people
who
dine
as
well
as
we
are
dining
have
no
room
left
for
mentality
they
become
all
digestion
brayle
laughed
nothing
like
a
good
dinner
if
one
has
an
appetite
for
it
i
think
it
quite
possible
that
faust
would
have
left
his
margaret
for
a
full
meal
i
sure
he
would
chimed
in
swinton
any
man
would
santoris
looked
down
the
table
with
a
curious
air
of
inspection
his
eyes
clear
and
searching
in
their
swift
glance
took
in
the
whole
group
of
us
harland
enjoying
succulent
asparagus
brayle
drinking
champagne
swinton
helping
himself
out
of
some
dish
of
good
things
offered
to
him
by
one
of
the
servants
catherine
playing
in
a
sort
of
demure
way
with
knife
and
fork
as
if
she
were
eating
against
her
will
and
finally
they
rested
on
me
to
whom
the
dinner
was
just
a
pretty
pageant
of
luxury
in
which
i
scarcely
took
any
part
well
whatever
faust
would
or
would
not
do
he
said
half
laughingly
it
certain
that
food
is
never
at
a
discount
women
frequently
are
women
said
harland
poising
a
stem
of
asparagus
in
the
air
are
so
constituted
as
to
invariably
make
havoc
either
of
themselves
or
of
the
men
they
profess
to
love
wives
neglect
their
husbands
and
husbands
naturally
desert
their
wives
devoted
lovers
quarrel
and
part
over
the
merest
trifles
the
whole
thing
is
a
mistake
what
whole
thing
asked
santoris
smiling
the
relations
between
man
and
woman
harland
answered
in
my
opinion
we
should
conduct
ourselves
like
the
birds
and
animals
whose
relationships
are
neither
binding
nor
lasting
but
are
just
sufficient
to
preserve
the
type
that
all
that
is
really
needed
what
is
called
love
is
mere
sentiment
do
you
endorse
that
verdict
miss
harland
santoris
asked
suddenly
catherine
looked
up
startled
her
yellow
skin
flushed
a
pale
red
i
do
know
she
answered
i
scarcely
heard
your
father
does
believe
in
love
he
said
do
you
i
hope
it
exists
she
murmured
but
nowadays
people
are
so
very
practical
oh
believe
me
they
are
no
more
practical
now
than
they
ever
were
averred
santoris
laughing
there
as
much
romance
in
the
modern
world
as
in
the
ancient
the
human
heart
has
the
same
passions
but
they
are
more
deeply
suppressed
and
therefore
more
dangerous
and
love
holds
the
same
eternal
sway
so
does
jealousy
brayle
looked
up
jealousy
is
an
uncivilised
thing
he
said
it
is
a
kind
of
primitive
passion
from
which
no
mind
should
suffer
santoris
smiled
primitive
passions
are
as
forceful
as
they
ever
were
he
answered
no
culture
can
do
away
with
them
jealousy
like
love
is
one
of
the
motive
powers
of
progress
it
is
a
great
evil
but
a
necessary
one
as
necessary
as
war
without
strife
of
some
sort
the
world
would
become
like
a
stagnant
pool
breeding
nothing
but
weeds
and
the
slimy
creatures
pertaining
to
foulness
even
in
love
the
most
divine
of
passions
there
should
be
a
wave
of
uncertainty
and
a
sense
of
unsolved
mystery
to
give
it
everlastingness
everlastingness
queried
harland
or
simply
life
lastingness
everlastingness
repeated
santoris
love
that
lacks
eternal
stability
is
not
love
at
all
but
simply
an
affectionate
understanding
and
agreeable
companionship
in
this
world
only
for
the
other
world
or
worlds
ah
you
are
going
too
far
interrupted
harland
you
know
i
can
not
follow
you
and
with
all
due
deference
to
the
fair
sex
i
very
much
doubt
if
any
one
of
them
would
care
for
a
love
that
was
destined
to
last
for
ever
no
man
would
interrupted
brayle
sarcastically
santoris
gave
him
a
quick
glance
no
man
is
asked
to
care
he
said
nor
woman
either
souls
are
not
only
asked
but
commanded
to
care
this
however
is
beyond
you
and
beyond
most
people
answered
brayle
such
ideas
are
purely
imaginary
and
transcendental
granted
and
santoris
gave
him
a
quick
straight
glance
but
what
do
you
mean
by
and
imagination
is
the
faculty
of
conceiving
in
the
brain
ideas
which
may
with
time
spring
to
the
full
fruition
of
realisation
every
item
of
our
civilisation
has
been
before
taking
practical
shape
means
beyond
the
ordinary
happenings
of
life
and
life
bodily
routine
and
this
expresses
itself
so
often
that
there
are
few
lives
lived
for
a
single
day
without
some
touch
of
its
inexplicable
marvel
it
is
on
such
lines
as
these
that
human
beings
drift
away
from
happiness
they
will
only
believe
what
they
can
see
while
all
the
time
their
actual
lives
depend
on
what
they
do
not
see
there
was
a
moment
silence
the
charm
of
his
voice
was
potent
and
still
more
so
the
fascination
of
his
manner
and
bearing
and
harland
looked
at
him
in
something
of
wonder
and
appeal
you
are
a
strange
fellow
santoris
he
said
at
last
and
you
always
were
even
now
i
can
hardly
believe
that
you
are
really
the
very
santoris
that
struck
such
terror
into
the
hearts
of
some
of
us
undergrads
at
oxford
i
say
i
can
hardly
believe
it
though
i
know
you
are
the
man
but
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
all
about
myself
and
santoris
smiled
i
will
with
pleasure
if
the
story
does
not
bore
you
there
is
no
mystery
about
it
no
magic
or
of
any
kind
i
have
done
nothing
since
i
left
college
but
adapt
myself
to
the
forces
of
nature
and
to
use
them
when
necessary
the
same
way
of
life
is
open
to
all
and
the
same
results
are
bound
to
follow
results
such
as
queried
brayle
health
youth
and
power
answered
santoris
with
an
involuntary
slight
clenching
of
the
firm
hand
that
rested
lightly
on
the
table
command
of
oneself
command
of
body
command
of
spirit
and
so
on
through
an
ever
ascending
scale
every
man
with
the
breath
of
god
in
him
is
a
master
not
a
slave
my
heart
beat
quickly
as
he
spoke
something
rose
up
in
me
like
a
response
to
a
call
and
i
wondered
did
he
assume
to
master
me
no
i
would
not
yield
to
that
if
yielding
were
necessary
it
must
be
my
own
free
will
that
gave
in
not
his
compelling
influence
as
this
thought
ran
through
my
brain
i
met
his
eyes
he
smiled
a
little
and
i
saw
he
had
guessed
my
mind
the
warm
blood
rushed
to
my
cheeks
in
a
fervent
glow
nevertheless
the
defiance
of
my
soul
was
strong
as
strong
as
the
love
which
had
begun
to
dominate
me
and
i
listened
eagerly
as
he
went
on
i
began
at
oxford
by
playing
the
slave
part
he
said
a
slave
to
conventions
and
of
instruction
one
can
really
learn
more
from
studying
the
actual
formation
of
rocks
than
from
those
worthy
dons
whom
nothing
will
move
out
of
their
customary
ruts
of
routine
even
at
that
early
time
i
felt
that
given
a
man
of
health
and
good
physical
condition
with
sound
brain
sound
lungs
and
firm
nerves
it
was
not
apparent
why
he
evidently
born
to
rule
should
put
himself
into
the
leading
strings
of
oxford
or
any
other
of
intellectual
effort
that
it
would
be
better
if
such
an
one
took
himself
in
hand
and
tried
to
find
out
his
own
meaning
both
in
relation
to
the
finite
and
infinite
gradations
of
spirit
and
matter
and
i
resolved
to
enter
upon
the
task
without
allowing
myself
to
fear
failure
or
to
hope
for
success
my
aim
was
to
discover
myself
and
my
meaning
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
no
atom
however
infinitesimal
is
without
origin
history
place
and
use
in
the
universe
and
i
a
conglomerated
mass
of
atoms
called
man
resolved
to
search
out
the
possibilities
finite
and
infinite
of
my
own
entity
with
this
aim
i
began
with
this
aim
i
continued
your
task
is
not
finished
then
put
in
brayle
with
a
smilingly
incredulous
air
it
will
never
be
finished
answered
santoris
an
eternal
thing
has
no
end
there
was
a
moment
silence
well
go
on
santoris
said
harland
with
a
touch
of
impatience
and
tell
us
especially
what
we
all
of
us
are
chiefly
anxious
to
know
how
it
is
that
you
are
young
when
according
to
the
time
of
the
world
you
should
be
old
santoris
smiled
again
ah
that
is
a
purely
personal
touch
of
inquisitiveness
he
answered
it
is
quite
human
and
natural
of
course
but
not
always
wise
in
every
great
lesson
of
life
or
scientific
discovery
people
ask
first
of
all
can
benefit
by
it
or
will
it
affect
me
and
while
asking
the
question
they
yet
will
not
trouble
to
get
an
answer
out
of
themselves
but
they
turn
to
others
for
the
solution
of
the
mystery
to
keep
young
is
not
at
all
difficult
when
certain
simple
processes
of
nature
are
mastered
the
difficulty
is
to
grow
old
we
all
sat
silent
waiting
in
mute
expectancy
the
servants
had
left
us
and
only
the
fruits
and
dainties
of
dessert
remained
to
tempt
us
in
baskets
and
dishes
of
exquisitely
coloured
venetian
glass
contrasting
with
the
graceful
clusters
of
lovely
roses
and
lilies
which
added
their
soft
charm
to
the
decorative
effect
of
the
table
and
santoris
passed
the
wine
a
choice
round
to
us
all
before
beginning
to
speak
again
and
when
he
did
speak
it
was
in
a
singularly
quiet
musical
voice
which
exercised
a
kind
of
spell
upon
my
ears
i
had
heard
that
voice
before
ah
how
often
how
often
through
the
course
of
my
life
had
i
listened
to
it
wonderingly
in
dreams
of
which
the
waking
morning
brought
no
explanation
how
it
had
stolen
upon
me
like
an
echo
from
far
away
when
alone
in
the
pauses
of
work
and
thought
i
had
longed
for
some
comprehension
and
sympathy
and
i
had
reproached
myself
for
my
own
fancies
and
imaginings
deeming
them
wholly
foolish
and
irresponsible
and
now
now
its
gentle
and
familiar
tone
went
straight
to
the
centre
of
my
spiritual
consciousness
and
forced
me
to
realise
that
for
the
soul
there
is
no
escape
from
its
immortal
remembrance
xi
one
way
of
love
when
i
left
oxford
he
said
as
i
told
you
before
i
left
what
i
conceived
to
be
slavery
that
is
a
submissively
ordered
routine
of
learning
in
which
there
occurred
nothing
new
nothing
hopeful
nothing
really
serviceable
i
mastered
all
there
was
to
master
and
carried
away
which
i
deemed
hardly
worth
winning
it
was
supposed
then
most
people
would
suppose
it
that
as
i
found
myself
the
possessor
of
an
income
of
between
five
and
six
thousand
a
year
i
would
naturally
my
life
as
the
phrase
goes
and
enter
upon
what
is
called
a
social
career
now
to
my
mind
a
social
career
simply
means
social
sham
and
to
live
my
life
had
always
a
broader
application
for
me
than
for
the
majority
of
men
so
having
ascertained
all
i
could
concerning
myself
and
my
affairs
from
my
father
london
solicitors
and
learning
exactly
how
i
was
situated
with
regard
to
finances
and
what
is
called
the
side
of
life
i
left
england
for
egypt
the
land
where
i
was
born
i
had
an
object
in
view
and
that
object
was
not
only
to
see
my
own
old
home
but
to
find
out
the
whereabouts
of
a
certain
great
sage
and
mystic
philosopher
long
known
in
the
east
by
the
name
of
heliobas
i
started
and
the
blood
rushed
to
my
cheeks
in
a
burning
flame
i
think
you
knew
him
he
went
on
addressing
me
directly
with
a
straight
glance
you
met
him
some
years
back
did
you
not
i
bent
my
head
in
silent
assent
and
saw
the
eyes
of
my
host
and
hostess
turned
upon
me
in
questioning
scrutiny
in
a
certain
circle
of
students
and
mystics
he
was
renowned
continued
santoris
and
i
resolved
to
see
what
he
could
make
of
me
what
he
would
advise
and
how
i
should
set
to
work
to
discover
what
i
had
resolved
to
find
however
at
the
end
of
a
long
and
tedious
journey
i
met
with
disappointment
heliobas
had
removed
to
another
sphere
of
action
he
was
dead
you
mean
interposed
harland
not
at
all
answered
santoris
calmly
there
is
no
death
to
put
it
quite
simply
he
had
reached
the
top
of
his
class
in
this
particular
school
of
life
and
learning
and
therefore
was
ready
and
willing
to
pass
on
into
the
higher
grade
he
however
left
a
successor
capable
of
maintaining
the
theories
he
inculcated
a
man
named
aselzion
who
elected
to
live
in
an
almost
inaccessible
spot
among
mountains
with
a
few
followers
and
disciples
him
i
found
after
considerable
difficulty
and
we
came
to
understand
each
other
so
well
that
i
stayed
with
him
some
time
studying
all
that
he
deemed
needful
before
i
started
on
my
own
voyage
of
discovery
his
methods
of
instruction
were
arduous
and
painful
in
fact
i
may
say
i
went
through
a
veritable
ordeal
of
fire
he
broke
off
and
for
a
moment
seemed
absorbed
in
recollections
you
are
speaking
i
suppose
of
some
rule
of
life
some
kind
of
novitiate
to
which
you
had
to
submit
yourself
said
harland
or
was
it
merely
a
course
of
study
in
one
sense
it
was
a
sort
of
novitiate
or
probation
answered
santoris
slowly
with
the
musing
look
still
in
his
eyes
in
another
it
was
as
you
put
it
a
course
of
study
merely
it
was
a
course
of
study
in
which
every
nerve
every
muscle
every
sinew
was
tested
to
its
utmost
strength
and
in
which
a
combat
between
the
spiritual
and
material
was
fiercely
fought
till
the
one
could
master
the
other
so
absolutely
as
to
hold
it
in
perfect
subjection
well
i
came
out
of
the
trial
fairly
well
strong
enough
at
any
rate
to
stand
alone
as
i
have
done
ever
since
and
to
what
did
your
severe
ordeal
lead
asked
brayle
who
by
this
time
appeared
interested
though
still
wearing
his
incredulous
air
to
anything
which
you
could
not
have
gained
just
as
easily
without
it
santoris
looked
straight
at
him
his
keen
eyes
glowed
as
though
some
bright
fire
of
the
soul
had
leaped
into
them
in
the
first
place
he
answered
it
led
me
to
power
power
not
only
over
myself
but
over
all
things
small
and
great
that
surround
or
concern
my
being
i
think
you
will
admit
that
if
a
man
takes
up
any
line
of
business
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
understand
all
its
technical
methods
and
practical
details
my
business
was
and
is
life
the
one
thing
that
humanity
never
studies
and
therefore
fails
to
master
harland
looked
up
life
is
mysterious
and
inexplicable
he
said
we
can
not
tell
why
we
live
no
one
can
fathom
that
mystery
we
are
here
through
no
conscious
desire
of
our
own
and
again
we
are
not
here
just
as
we
have
learned
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
the
fact
of
being
anywhere
true
answered
santoris
but
to
understand
the
of
life
we
must
first
of
all
realise
that
its
origin
is
love
love
creates
life
because
it
must
even
agnostics
when
pushed
to
the
wall
in
argument
grant
that
some
mysterious
and
mighty
force
is
at
the
back
of
creation
a
force
which
is
both
intelligent
and
beneficent
the
trite
saying
is
love
is
true
enough
but
it
is
quite
as
true
to
say
is
god
the
commencement
of
universes
solar
systems
and
worlds
is
the
desire
of
love
to
express
itself
no
more
and
no
less
than
this
from
desire
springs
action
from
action
life
it
only
remains
for
each
living
unit
to
bring
itself
into
harmonious
union
with
this
one
fundamental
law
of
the
whole
cosmos
the
expression
and
action
of
love
which
is
based
as
naturally
it
must
be
on
a
dual
entity
what
do
you
mean
by
that
asked
brayle
as
a
physician
and
i
presume
as
a
scientist
you
ought
scarcely
to
ask
replied
santoris
with
a
slight
smile
for
you
surely
know
there
is
no
single
thing
in
the
universe
the
very
microbes
of
disease
or
health
go
in
pairs
light
and
darkness
the
up
and
the
down
the
right
and
the
left
the
storm
and
the
calm
the
male
and
the
female
all
things
are
dual
and
the
sorrows
of
humanity
are
for
the
most
part
the
result
of
numbers
figures
brought
together
that
will
not
count
up
properly
wrong
halves
of
the
puzzle
that
will
never
fit
into
place
the
mischief
runs
through
all
civilization
wrong
halves
of
races
brought
together
which
do
not
and
never
can
assimilate
and
in
an
individual
personal
sense
wrong
halves
of
spirit
and
matter
are
often
forced
together
which
are
bound
by
law
to
separate
in
time
with
some
attendant
disaster
the
error
is
caused
by
the
obstinate
miscomprehension
of
man
himself
as
to
the
nature
and
extent
of
his
own
powers
and
faculties
he
forgets
that
he
is
not
the
beasts
that
perish
but
that
he
has
the
breath
of
god
in
him
that
he
holds
within
himself
the
seed
of
immortality
which
is
perpetually
he
is
bound
by
all
the
laws
of
the
universe
to
give
that
immortal
life
its
dual
entity
and
attendant
power
without
which
he
can
not
attain
his
highest
ends
it
may
take
him
thousands
of
years
cycles
of
time
but
it
has
to
be
done
materially
speaking
he
may
perhaps
consider
that
he
has
secured
his
dual
entity
by
a
pleasing
or
fortunate
marriage
but
if
he
is
not
spiritually
mated
his
marriage
is
useless
ay
worse
than
useless
as
it
only
interposes
fresh
obstacles
between
himself
and
his
intended
progress
marriage
can
hardly
be
called
a
useless
institution
said
brayle
with
an
uplifting
of
his
sinister
brows
it
helps
to
populate
the
world
it
does
answered
santoris
calmly
but
if
the
pairs
that
are
joined
in
marriage
have
no
spiritual
bond
between
them
and
nothing
beyond
the
attraction
of
the
mere
body
they
people
the
world
with
more
or
less
incapable
unthinking
and
foolish
creatures
like
themselves
and
supposing
these
to
be
born
in
tens
of
millions
like
ants
or
flies
they
will
not
carry
on
the
real
purpose
of
man
existence
to
anything
more
than
that
stoppage
and
recoil
which
is
called
death
but
which
in
reality
is
only
a
turning
back
of
the
wheels
of
time
when
the
right
road
has
been
lost
and
it
becomes
imperative
to
begin
the
journey
all
over
again
we
sat
silent
no
one
had
any
comment
to
offer
we
are
arriving
at
that
same
old
once
more
he
continued
the
western
civilisation
of
two
thousand
years
assisted
and
sometimes
impeded
by
the
teachings
of
christianity
is
nearing
its
end
out
of
the
vast
wreckage
of
nations
now
imminent
only
a
few
individuals
can
be
saved
and
the
storm
is
so
close
at
hand
that
one
can
almost
hear
the
mutterings
of
the
thunder
but
why
should
i
or
you
or
anyone
else
think
about
it
we
have
our
own
concerns
to
attend
to
and
we
attend
to
these
so
well
that
we
forget
all
the
most
vital
necessities
that
should
make
them
of
any
importance
however
in
this
day
nothing
matters
shall
i
go
on
with
my
own
story
or
have
you
heard
enough
not
half
enough
said
catherine
harland
quite
suddenly
she
had
scarcely
spoken
before
but
she
now
leaned
forward
looking
eagerly
interested
you
speak
of
power
over
yourself
do
you
possess
the
same
power
over
others
not
unless
they
come
into
my
own
circle
of
action
he
answered
it
would
not
be
worth
my
while
to
exert
any
influence
on
persons
who
are
and
ever
must
be
indifferent
to
me
i
can
of
course
defend
myself
against
enemies
and
that
without
lifting
a
hand
everyone
save
myself
looked
at
him
inquisitively
but
he
did
not
explain
his
meaning
he
went
on
very
quietly
with
his
own
personal
narrative
as
i
have
told
you
he
said
i
came
out
of
my
studies
with
aselzion
successfully
enough
to
feel
justified
in
going
on
with
my
work
alone
i
took
up
my
residence
in
egypt
in
my
father
old
home
a
pretty
place
enough
with
wide
pleasure
grounds
planted
thickly
with
palm
trees
and
richly
filled
with
flowers
and
here
i
undertook
the
mastery
and
comprehension
of
the
most
difficult
subject
ever
propounded
for
learning
the
most
evasive
complex
yet
exact
piece
of
mathematics
ever
set
out
for
solving
myself
myself
was
my
puzzle
how
to
unite
myself
with
nature
so
thoroughly
as
to
insinuate
myself
into
her
secrets
possess
all
she
could
offer
me
and
yet
detach
myself
from
self
so
completely
as
to
be
ready
to
sacrifice
all
i
had
gained
at
a
moment
notice
should
that
moment
come
you
are
paradoxical
said
harland
irritably
what
the
use
of
gaining
anything
if
it
is
to
be
lost
at
a
moment
bidding
it
is
the
only
way
to
hold
and
keep
whatever
there
is
to
win
answered
santoris
calmly
and
the
paradox
is
no
greater
than
that
of
that
loveth
his
life
shall
lose
it
the
only
of
supreme
is
love
when
that
comes
everything
else
must
go
love
alone
can
compass
life
perfect
it
complete
it
and
carry
it
on
to
eternal
happiness
but
please
bear
in
mind
that
i
am
speaking
of
real
love
not
mere
physical
attraction
the
two
things
are
as
different
as
light
from
darkness
is
your
curious
conception
or
ideal
of
love
the
reason
why
you
have
never
married
asked
brayle
abruptly
precisely
replied
santoris
it
is
most
unquestionably
and
emphatically
the
reason
why
i
have
never
married
there
was
a
pause
i
saw
catherine
glancing
at
him
with
a
strange
furtiveness
in
which
there
was
something
of
fear
you
have
never
met
your
ideal
i
suppose
she
asked
with
a
faint
smile
oh
yes
i
met
her
he
answered
ages
ago
on
many
occasions
i
have
met
her
sometimes
she
has
estranged
herself
from
me
sometimes
she
has
been
torn
from
me
by
others
and
still
more
often
i
have
through
my
own
folly
and
obstinacy
separated
myself
from
her
but
our
mutual
mistakes
do
no
more
than
delay
the
inevitable
union
at
last
here
he
spoke
slowly
and
with
marked
meaning
for
it
is
an
inevitable
union
as
inevitable
as
that
of
two
electrons
which
after
spinning
in
space
for
certain
periods
of
time
rush
together
at
last
and
remain
so
indissolubly
united
that
nothing
can
ever
separate
them
and
then
queried
brayle
with
an
ironical
air
then
why
everything
is
possible
then
beauty
perfection
wisdom
progress
creativeness
and
a
world
even
worlds
of
splendid
thought
and
splendid
ideals
bound
to
lead
to
still
more
splendid
realisation
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
two
brains
two
minds
moving
so
absolutely
in
unison
that
like
a
grand
chord
of
music
they
strike
harmony
through
hitherto
dumb
but
think
of
two
immortal
souls
full
of
a
love
as
deathless
as
themselves
conjoined
in
highest
effort
and
superb
attainment
the
love
of
angel
for
angel
of
god
for
god
you
think
this
ideal
imaginative
transcendental
impossible
yet
i
swear
to
you
it
is
the
most
real
possibility
in
this
fleeting
mirage
of
a
world
his
voice
thrilled
with
a
warmth
of
feeling
and
conviction
and
as
i
heard
him
speak
i
trembled
inwardly
with
a
sudden
remorse
a
quick
sense
of
inferiority
and
shame
why
could
i
not
let
myself
go
why
did
i
not
give
the
fluttering
spirit
within
me
room
to
expand
its
wings
something
opposing
something
inimical
to
my
peace
and
happiness
held
me
back
and
presently
i
began
to
wonder
whether
i
should
attribute
it
to
the
influence
of
those
with
whom
i
was
temporarily
associated
i
was
almost
confirmed
in
this
impression
when
harland
voice
harsh
and
caustic
as
it
could
be
when
he
was
irritated
or
worsted
in
an
argument
broke
the
momentary
silence
you
are
more
impossible
now
than
you
ever
were
at
oxford
santoris
he
said
you
all
transcendentalism
you
know
or
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
immortal
soul
and
if
you
believe
otherwise
you
have
brought
yourself
voluntarily
into
that
state
of
blind
credulity
all
science
teaches
us
that
we
are
the
mere
spawn
of
the
planet
on
which
we
live
we
are
here
to
make
the
best
of
it
for
ourselves
and
for
others
who
come
after
us
and
there
an
end
what
is
called
love
is
the
mere
physical
attraction
between
the
two
sexes
no
more
and
it
soon
palls
all
that
we
gain
we
quickly
cease
to
care
for
it
is
the
way
of
humanity
what
a
poor
creation
humanity
is
then
said
santoris
with
a
smile
how
astonishing
that
it
should
exist
at
all
for
no
higher
aims
than
those
of
the
ant
or
the
mouse
my
dear
harland
if
your
beliefs
were
really
sound
we
should
be
bound
in
common
duty
and
charity
to
stop
the
population
of
the
world
altogether
for
the
whole
business
is
useless
useless
and
even
cruel
for
it
is
nothing
but
a
crime
to
allow
people
to
be
born
for
no
other
end
than
extinction
however
keep
your
creeds
i
thank
heaven
they
are
not
mine
harland
gave
a
slight
movement
of
impatience
i
could
see
that
he
was
disturbed
in
his
mind
let
talk
of
something
i
can
follow
he
said
the
personal
and
material
side
of
things
your
perennial
condition
of
health
for
example
your
apparent
youth
oh
is
it
only
laughed
santoris
gaily
well
to
those
who
never
knew
me
in
my
boyhood
days
and
are
therefore
never
hurling
me
back
to
their
years
or
more
ago
of
friendship
my
youth
seems
very
actual
you
see
their
to
count
up
the
time
i
have
spent
on
earth
obliges
them
to
accept
me
at
my
own
valuation
there
really
nothing
to
explain
in
the
matter
everyone
can
keep
young
if
he
understands
himself
and
nature
if
i
were
to
tell
you
the
literal
truth
of
the
process
you
would
not
believe
me
and
even
if
you
did
you
would
not
have
the
patience
to
carry
it
out
but
what
does
it
matter
after
all
if
we
only
live
for
the
express
purpose
of
dying
the
sooner
we
get
the
business
over
and
done
with
the
better
youth
itself
has
no
charms
under
such
circumstances
all
the
purposes
of
life
however
lofty
and
nobly
planned
are
bound
to
end
in
nothingness
and
it
is
hardly
worth
while
taking
the
trouble
to
breathe
the
murderous
air
he
spoke
with
a
kind
of
passion
his
eyes
were
luminous
his
face
transfigured
with
an
almost
superhuman
glow
and
we
all
looked
at
him
in
something
of
amazement
harland
fidgeted
uneasily
in
his
chair
you
go
too
far
he
said
life
is
agreeable
as
long
as
it
lasts
have
you
found
it
so
santoris
interrupted
him
has
it
not
even
in
your
pursuit
and
attainment
of
wealth
brought
you
more
pain
than
pleasure
number
up
all
the
possibilities
of
life
from
the
existence
of
the
labourer
in
his
hut
to
that
of
the
king
on
his
throne
they
are
none
of
them
worth
striving
for
or
keeping
if
death
is
the
ultimate
end
ambition
is
merest
folly
wealth
a
temporary
possession
of
perishable
goods
which
must
pass
to
others
fame
a
brief
noise
of
one
name
in
mouths
that
will
soon
be
dumb
and
love
only
what
a
treacherous
and
criminal
act
then
is
this
creation
of
universes
what
mad
folly
what
sheer
blind
reasonless
wickedness
there
was
a
silence
his
eyes
flashed
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
can
you
deny
it
he
demanded
can
you
find
any
sane
logical
reason
for
the
continuance
of
life
which
is
to
end
in
utter
extinction
or
for
the
creation
of
worlds
doomed
to
eternal
destruction
no
one
spoke
you
have
no
answer
ready
he
said
and
smiled
naturally
for
an
answer
is
impossible
and
here
you
have
the
key
to
what
you
consider
my
mystery
the
mystery
of
keeping
young
instead
of
growing
old
the
secret
of
living
instead
of
dying
it
is
simply
the
conscious
practical
realisation
that
there
is
no
death
but
only
change
that
is
the
first
part
of
the
process
change
or
transmutation
and
transformation
of
the
atoms
and
elements
of
which
we
are
composed
is
going
on
for
ever
without
a
second
cessation
it
began
when
we
were
born
and
before
we
were
born
and
the
art
of
living
young
consists
simply
in
using
soul
and
to
guide
this
process
of
change
towards
the
ends
we
desire
instead
of
leaving
it
to
blind
chance
and
to
the
association
with
inimical
influences
which
interfere
with
our
best
actions
for
example
i
a
man
in
sound
health
and
condition
realise
that
with
every
moment
some
change
is
working
in
me
towards
some
end
it
rests
entirely
with
myself
as
to
whether
the
change
shall
be
towards
continuance
of
health
or
towards
admission
of
disease
towards
continuance
of
youth
or
towards
the
encouragement
of
age
towards
life
as
it
presents
itself
to
me
now
or
towards
some
other
phase
of
life
as
i
perceive
it
in
the
future
i
can
advance
or
retard
myself
as
i
please
the
proper
management
of
myself
being
my
business
if
i
should
suffer
pain
or
illness
i
am
very
sure
it
will
be
chiefly
through
my
own
fault
if
i
invite
decay
and
decrepitude
it
will
be
because
i
allow
these
forces
to
encroach
upon
my
in
fact
briefly
i
am
what
i
will
to
be
and
all
the
laws
that
brought
me
into
existence
support
me
in
this
attitude
of
mind
body
and
spirit
if
we
could
all
become
what
we
would
be
said
brayle
we
should
attain
the
millennium
are
you
sure
of
that
queried
santoris
would
it
not
rather
depend
on
the
particular
choice
each
one
of
us
might
make
you
for
example
might
wish
to
be
something
that
would
hardly
tend
to
your
happiness
and
your
wish
being
obtained
you
might
become
what
if
you
had
only
realised
it
you
would
give
worlds
not
to
be
some
men
desire
to
be
thieves
even
murderers
and
become
so
but
the
end
of
their
desires
is
not
perhaps
what
they
imagined
can
you
read
people
thoughts
asked
catherine
suddenly
santoris
looked
amused
he
replied
by
a
counter
question
would
you
be
sorry
if
i
could
she
flushed
a
little
i
smiled
knowing
what
was
in
her
mind
it
would
be
a
most
unpleasant
accomplishment
that
of
reading
the
thoughts
of
others
said
harland
i
would
rather
not
cultivate
it
but
santoris
almost
implies
that
he
possesses
it
said
brayle
with
a
touch
of
irritation
in
his
manner
and
after
all
is
a
kind
of
society
amusement
nowadays
there
is
nothing
very
difficult
in
it
nothing
indeed
agreed
santoris
lightly
and
being
as
easy
as
it
is
why
do
you
not
show
us
at
once
that
antique
piece
of
jewellery
you
have
in
your
pocket
you
brought
it
with
you
this
evening
to
show
to
me
and
ask
my
opinion
of
its
value
did
you
not
brayle
eyes
opened
in
utter
amazement
if
ever
a
man
was
taken
completely
by
surprise
he
was
how
did
you
know
he
began
stammeringly
while
harland
equally
astonished
stared
at
him
through
his
round
spectacles
as
though
challenging
some
defiance
santoris
laughed
is
only
a
society
amusement
as
you
have
just
observed
he
said
and
i
have
been
amusing
myself
with
it
for
the
last
few
minutes
come
let
us
see
your
treasure
brayle
was
thoroughly
embarrassed
but
he
tried
to
cover
his
confusion
by
an
awkward
laugh
well
you
have
made
a
very
clever
hit
he
said
quite
a
random
shot
of
course
which
by
mere
coincidence
went
to
its
mark
it
quite
true
i
have
brought
with
me
a
curious
piece
of
which
i
always
carry
about
wherever
i
go
and
something
moved
me
to
ask
your
opinion
of
its
value
as
well
as
to
place
its
period
it
is
old
italian
but
even
experts
are
not
agreed
as
to
its
exact
date
he
put
his
hand
in
his
breast
pocket
and
drew
out
a
small
silk
bag
from
which
he
took
with
great
care
a
collar
of
jewels
designed
in
a
kind
of
which
made
it
perfectly
flexible
he
laid
it
out
on
the
table
and
i
bit
my
lip
hard
to
suppress
an
involuntary
exclamation
for
i
had
seen
the
thing
before
and
for
the
immediate
moment
could
not
realise
where
till
a
sudden
flash
of
light
through
the
cells
of
my
brain
reminded
me
of
that
scene
of
love
and
death
in
the
vision
of
the
artist
studio
when
the
name
de
medicis
had
been
whispered
like
an
evil
omen
the
murderer
in
that
had
worn
a
collar
of
jewels
precisely
similar
to
the
one
i
now
saw
but
i
could
only
keep
silence
and
listen
with
every
nerve
strained
to
utmost
attention
while
santoris
took
the
ornament
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
with
an
intent
earnestness
in
which
there
was
almost
a
touch
of
compassion
a
beautiful
piece
of
workmanship
he
said
at
last
slowly
while
harland
catherine
and
swinton
the
secretary
all
drew
up
closer
to
him
at
the
table
and
leaned
eagerly
forward
and
i
should
say
here
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
full
at
the
dark
brooding
sinister
face
of
brayle
i
should
say
that
it
belonged
to
the
medici
period
it
must
have
been
part
of
the
dress
of
a
nobleman
of
that
time
the
design
seems
to
me
to
be
florentine
perhaps
if
these
jewels
could
speak
they
might
tell
a
strange
story
they
are
unhappy
stones
unhappy
exclaimed
catherine
you
mean
unlucky
no
there
is
no
such
thing
as
luck
answered
santoris
quietly
turning
the
collar
over
and
over
in
his
hands
not
for
either
jewels
or
men
but
there
is
unhappiness
and
unhappiness
simply
means
life
being
put
to
wrong
uses
i
call
these
gems
because
they
have
been
wrongfully
used
a
precious
stone
is
a
living
thing
it
absorbs
influences
as
the
earth
absorbs
light
and
these
jewels
have
absorbed
some
sense
of
evil
that
renders
them
less
beautiful
than
they
might
be
these
diamonds
and
rubies
these
emeralds
and
sapphires
have
not
the
full
lustre
of
their
own
true
nature
they
are
in
the
condition
of
pining
flowers
it
will
take
centuries
before
they
resume
their
natural
brilliancy
there
is
some
tragedy
hidden
among
them
brayle
looked
amused
well
i
can
give
you
no
history
of
them
he
said
a
friend
of
mine
bought
the
collar
from
an
old
jew
curiosity
dealer
in
a
back
street
of
florence
and
sent
it
to
me
to
wear
with
a
florentine
dress
at
a
fancy
dress
ball
curiously
enough
i
chose
to
represent
one
of
the
medicis
some
artist
having
told
me
my
features
resembled
their
type
of
countenance
that
the
chronicle
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
rather
liked
it
on
account
of
its
antiquity
i
could
have
sold
it
many
times
over
but
i
have
no
desire
to
part
with
it
naturally
and
santoris
passed
on
the
collar
to
everyone
to
examine
you
feel
a
sense
of
proprietorship
in
it
catherine
harland
had
the
trinket
in
her
hand
and
a
curious
vague
look
of
terror
came
over
her
face
as
she
presently
passed
it
back
to
its
owner
but
she
made
no
remark
and
it
was
harland
who
resumed
the
conversation
that
an
odd
idea
of
yours
about
unhappy
jewels
he
said
perhaps
the
misfortune
attending
the
possessors
of
the
famous
blue
hope
diamond
could
be
traced
to
some
early
tragedy
connected
with
it
unquestionably
replied
santoris
now
look
at
this
and
he
drew
from
his
watch
pocket
a
small
fine
gold
chain
to
which
was
attached
a
moonstone
of
singular
size
and
beauty
set
in
a
circle
of
diamonds
here
is
a
sort
of
talismanic
jewel
it
has
never
known
any
disastrous
influences
nor
has
it
been
disturbed
by
malevolent
surroundings
it
is
a
perfectly
happy
unsullied
gem
as
you
see
the
lustre
is
perfect
as
clear
as
that
of
a
summer
moon
in
heaven
yet
it
is
a
very
old
jewel
and
has
seen
more
than
a
thousand
years
of
life
we
all
examined
the
beautiful
ornament
and
as
i
held
it
in
my
hand
a
moment
it
seemed
to
emit
tiny
sparks
of
luminance
like
a
flash
of
moonlight
on
rippling
waves
women
should
take
care
that
their
jewels
are
made
happy
he
continued
looking
at
me
with
a
slight
smile
that
is
if
they
want
them
to
shine
nothing
that
lives
is
at
its
best
unless
it
is
in
a
condition
of
happiness
a
condition
which
after
all
is
quite
easy
to
attain
easy
i
should
have
thought
nothing
was
so
difficult
said
harland
nothing
certainly
is
so
difficult
in
the
ordinary
way
of
life
men
choose
to
live
answered
santoris
for
the
most
part
they
run
after
the
shadow
and
forsake
the
light
even
in
work
and
the
creative
action
of
thought
each
ordinary
man
imagines
that
his
especial
work
being
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
sacrifice
everything
to
it
and
he
does
if
he
is
filled
with
worldly
ambition
and
selfish
concentration
and
he
produces
something
anything
which
frequently
proves
to
be
ephemeral
as
gossamer
dust
it
is
only
when
work
is
the
outcome
of
a
great
love
and
keen
sympathy
for
others
that
it
lasts
and
keeps
its
influence
now
we
have
talked
enough
about
all
these
theories
which
are
not
interesting
to
anyone
who
is
not
prepared
to
accept
them
shall
we
go
up
on
deck
we
all
rose
at
once
santoris
holding
out
a
box
of
cigars
to
the
men
to
help
themselves
catherine
and
i
preceded
them
up
the
saloon
stairs
to
the
deck
which
was
now
like
a
sheet
of
silver
in
the
light
shed
by
one
of
the
loveliest
moons
of
the
year
the
water
around
was
sparkling
with
phosphorescence
and
the
dark
mountains
looked
higher
and
more
imposing
than
ever
rising
as
they
seemed
to
do
sheer
up
from
the
white
splendour
of
the
sea
i
leaned
over
the
deck
rail
gazing
down
into
the
deep
liquid
mirror
of
stars
below
and
my
heart
was
heavy
and
full
of
a
sense
of
bitterness
and
tears
catherine
had
dropped
languidly
into
a
chair
and
was
leaning
back
in
it
with
a
strange
expression
on
her
tired
face
suddenly
she
spoke
with
an
almost
mournful
gentleness
do
you
like
his
theories
i
turned
towards
her
enquiringly
i
mean
do
you
like
the
idea
of
there
being
no
death
and
that
we
only
change
from
one
life
to
another
and
so
on
for
ever
she
continued
to
me
it
is
appalling
sometimes
i
think
death
the
kindest
thing
that
can
happen
especially
for
women
i
was
in
the
mood
to
agree
with
her
i
went
up
to
her
and
knelt
down
by
her
side
yes
i
said
and
i
felt
the
tremor
of
tears
in
my
voice
yes
for
women
death
often
seems
very
kind
when
there
is
no
love
and
no
hope
of
love
when
the
world
is
growing
grey
and
the
shadows
are
deepening
towards
night
when
the
ones
we
most
dearly
love
misjudge
and
mistrust
us
and
their
hearts
are
closed
against
our
tenderness
then
death
seems
the
greatest
god
of
all
one
before
whom
we
may
well
kneel
and
offer
up
our
prayers
who
could
who
would
live
for
ever
quite
alone
in
an
eternity
without
love
oh
how
much
kinder
how
much
sweeter
would
be
utter
extinction
my
voice
broke
and
catherine
moved
by
some
sudden
womanly
impulse
put
her
arm
round
me
why
you
are
crying
she
said
softly
what
is
it
you
who
are
always
so
bright
and
happy
i
quickly
controlled
the
weakness
of
my
tears
yes
it
is
foolish
i
said
but
i
feel
as
if
i
had
wasted
a
good
part
of
my
life
in
useless
research
in
looking
for
what
has
been
after
all
quite
close
to
my
hand
only
that
i
failed
to
see
it
and
that
i
must
go
back
upon
the
road
i
thought
i
had
passed
here
i
paused
i
saw
she
could
not
understand
me
catherine
i
went
on
abruptly
will
you
let
me
leave
you
in
a
day
or
two
i
have
been
quite
a
fortnight
with
you
on
board
the
and
i
think
i
have
had
enough
holiday
i
should
like
and
i
looked
up
at
her
from
where
i
knelt
i
should
like
to
part
from
you
while
we
remain
good
friends
and
i
have
an
idea
that
perhaps
we
shall
not
agree
so
well
if
we
learn
to
know
more
of
each
other
she
bent
her
eyes
upon
me
with
a
expression
how
strange
you
should
think
that
she
murmured
i
have
felt
the
same
and
yet
i
really
like
you
very
much
i
always
liked
you
i
wish
you
would
believe
it
i
smiled
dear
catherine
i
said
it
is
no
use
shutting
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
while
there
is
something
which
attracts
us
to
each
other
there
is
also
something
which
repels
we
can
not
argue
about
it
or
analyse
it
such
mysterious
things
do
occur
and
they
are
beyond
our
searching
out
but
she
interrupted
quickly
we
were
not
so
troubled
by
these
mysterious
things
till
we
met
this
man
santoris
she
broke
off
and
i
rose
to
my
feet
as
just
then
santoris
approached
accompanied
by
harland
and
the
others
i
have
suggested
giving
you
a
sail
by
moonlight
before
you
leave
he
said
it
will
be
an
old
experience
for
you
under
new
conditions
sailing
by
moonlight
in
an
ordinary
sense
is
an
ordinary
thing
but
sailing
by
moonlight
with
the
moonlight
as
part
of
our
motive
power
has
perhaps
a
touch
of
originality
as
he
spoke
he
made
a
sign
to
one
of
his
men
who
came
up
to
receive
his
orders
which
were
given
in
too
low
a
tone
for
us
to
hear
easy
deck
chairs
were
placed
for
all
the
party
and
we
were
soon
seated
in
a
group
together
somewhat
silently
at
first
our
attention
being
entirely
riveted
on
the
wonderful
almost
noiseless
way
in
which
the
sails
of
the
were
unfurled
there
was
no
wind
the
night
was
warm
and
intensely
still
the
sea
absolutely
calm
like
broad
white
wings
the
canvas
gradually
spread
out
under
the
deft
quick
hands
of
the
sailors
employed
in
handling
it
the
anchor
was
drawn
up
in
the
same
swift
and
silent
manner
then
there
came
an
instant
pause
harland
drew
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
looked
up
amazed
as
we
all
did
at
the
mysterious
way
in
which
the
sails
filled
out
pulling
the
cordage
tightly
into
bands
of
iron
strength
and
none
of
us
could
restrain
an
involuntary
cry
of
wonder
and
admiration
as
their
whiteness
began
to
glitter
with
the
radiance
of
the
strange
luminance
deepening
in
intensity
till
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
stretch
of
canvas
from
end
to
end
of
the
magnificent
schooner
was
a
mass
of
fine
sparkling
under
the
moon
well
however
much
i
disagree
with
your
theories
of
life
santoris
said
harland
i
will
give
you
full
credit
for
this
extraordinary
yacht
of
yours
it
the
most
wonderful
thing
i
ever
saw
and
you
are
a
wonderful
fellow
to
have
carried
out
such
an
unique
application
of
science
you
ought
to
impart
your
secret
to
the
world
santoris
laughed
lightly
and
the
world
would
take
a
hundred
years
or
more
to
discuss
it
consider
it
deny
it
and
finally
accept
it
he
said
no
one
grows
tired
of
asking
the
world
to
be
either
wise
or
happy
it
prefers
its
own
way
just
as
i
prefer
mine
it
will
discover
the
method
of
sailing
without
wind
and
it
will
learn
how
to
make
every
sort
of
mechanical
progress
without
steam
in
time
but
not
in
our
day
and
i
personally
can
not
afford
to
wait
while
it
is
slowly
learning
its
abc
like
a
big
child
under
protest
you
see
we
going
now
we
were
indeed
it
would
have
been
more
correct
to
say
we
were
flying
over
the
still
water
our
vessel
glided
like
a
moving
beautiful
shape
of
white
fire
swiftly
and
steadily
with
no
sound
save
the
little
hissing
murmur
of
the
water
cleft
under
her
keel
and
then
like
a
sudden
whisper
from
fairyland
came
the
ripple
of
running
upward
in
phrases
of
exquisite
melody
and
a
boy
voice
clear
soft
and
full
began
to
sing
with
a
pure
enunciation
which
enabled
us
to
hear
every
word
sailing
sailing
whither
what
path
of
the
flashing
sea
seems
best
for
you
and
me
no
matter
the
way
by
night
or
day
so
long
as
we
sail
together
sailing
sailing
whither
into
the
rosy
grace
of
the
sun
deep
we
need
not
know
how
far
we
go
so
long
as
we
sail
together
sailing
sailing
whither
to
the
glittering
rainbow
strand
of
love
enchanted
land
we
ask
not
where
in
earth
or
air
so
long
as
we
sail
together
sailing
sailing
whither
on
to
the
life
divine
your
soul
made
one
with
mine
in
heaven
or
hell
all
must
be
well
so
long
as
we
sail
together
the
song
finished
with
a
passionate
chord
which
played
as
it
was
with
swift
intensity
seemed
to
awaken
a
response
from
the
sea
at
any
rate
a
strange
shivering
echo
trembled
upward
as
it
were
from
the
water
and
floated
into
the
spacious
silence
of
the
night
my
heart
beat
with
uncomfortable
quickness
and
my
eyes
grew
hot
with
the
weight
of
suppressed
tears
why
could
i
not
escape
from
the
cruel
restraining
force
that
held
my
real
self
prisoner
as
with
manacles
of
steel
i
could
not
even
speak
and
while
the
others
were
clapping
their
hands
in
delighted
applause
at
the
beauty
of
both
voice
and
song
i
sat
silent
he
sings
well
said
santoris
he
is
the
eastern
lad
you
saw
when
you
came
on
deck
this
morning
i
brought
him
from
egypt
he
will
give
us
another
song
presently
shall
we
walk
a
little
we
rose
and
paced
the
deck
slowly
gradually
dividing
in
couples
catherine
and
brayle
harland
and
his
secretary
santoris
and
myself
we
two
paused
together
at
the
stern
of
the
vessel
looking
towards
the
bowsprit
which
seemed
to
pierce
the
distance
of
sea
and
sky
like
a
flying
arrow
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
alone
said
santoris
then
do
you
not
though
i
know
what
you
want
to
say
i
glanced
at
him
with
a
touch
of
defiance
then
i
need
not
speak
i
answered
no
you
need
not
speak
unless
you
give
utterance
to
what
is
in
your
true
soul
he
said
i
would
rather
you
did
not
play
at
conventions
with
me
for
the
moment
i
felt
almost
angry
i
do
not
play
at
conventions
i
murmured
oh
do
you
not
is
that
quite
candid
i
raised
my
eyes
and
met
his
he
was
smiling
some
of
the
oppression
in
my
soul
suddenly
gave
way
and
i
spoke
hurriedly
in
a
low
tone
surely
you
know
how
difficult
it
is
for
me
i
said
things
have
happened
so
strangely
and
we
are
surrounded
here
by
influences
that
compel
conventionality
i
can
not
speak
to
you
as
frankly
as
i
would
under
other
circumstances
it
is
easy
for
you
to
be
yourself
you
have
gained
the
mastery
over
all
lesser
forces
than
your
own
but
with
me
it
is
different
perhaps
when
i
am
away
i
shall
be
able
to
think
more
calmly
you
are
going
away
he
asked
gently
yes
it
is
better
so
he
remained
silent
i
went
on
quickly
i
am
going
away
because
i
feel
inadequate
and
unable
to
cope
with
my
present
surroundings
i
have
had
some
experience
of
the
same
influences
before
i
know
i
have
i
also
he
interrupted
well
you
must
realise
this
better
than
i
and
i
looked
at
him
now
with
greater
courage
and
if
you
have
you
know
they
have
led
to
trouble
i
want
you
to
help
me
i
to
help
you
he
said
how
can
i
help
you
when
you
leave
me
there
was
something
infinitely
sad
in
his
voice
and
the
old
fear
came
over
me
like
a
chill
i
should
lose
what
i
had
gained
if
i
leave
you
i
said
tremblingly
i
do
so
because
i
am
not
worthy
to
be
with
you
oh
can
you
not
see
this
in
me
for
as
i
spoke
he
took
my
hand
in
his
and
held
it
with
a
kindly
clasp
i
am
so
so
proud
so
unworthy
there
are
a
thousand
things
i
would
say
to
you
but
i
dare
not
not
here
or
now
no
one
will
approach
us
he
said
still
holding
my
hand
i
am
keeping
the
others
unconsciously
to
themselves
at
a
distance
till
you
have
finished
speaking
tell
me
some
of
these
thousand
things
i
looked
up
at
him
and
saw
the
deep
lustre
of
his
eyes
filled
with
a
great
tenderness
he
drew
me
a
little
closer
to
his
side
tell
me
he
persisted
softly
is
there
very
much
that
we
do
not
if
we
are
true
to
each
other
know
already
you
know
more
than
i
do
i
answered
and
i
want
to
be
equal
with
you
i
do
i
can
not
be
content
to
feel
that
i
am
groping
in
the
dark
weakly
and
blindly
while
you
are
in
the
light
strong
and
you
can
help
me
and
you
will
help
me
you
will
tell
me
where
i
should
go
and
study
as
you
did
with
aselzion
he
started
back
amazed
with
aselzion
dear
forgive
me
you
are
a
woman
it
is
impossible
that
you
should
suffer
so
great
an
ordeal
so
severe
a
strain
and
why
should
you
attempt
it
if
you
would
let
me
i
would
be
sufficient
for
you
but
i
will
not
let
you
i
said
quickly
roused
to
a
kind
of
defiant
energy
i
wish
to
go
to
the
very
source
of
your
instruction
and
then
i
shall
see
where
i
stand
with
regard
to
you
if
i
stay
here
now
it
will
be
the
same
old
story
over
again
he
said
love
and
mistrust
then
drifting
apart
in
the
same
weary
way
is
it
not
possible
to
avoid
the
errors
of
the
past
no
i
said
resolutely
for
me
it
is
not
possible
i
can
not
yield
to
my
own
inward
promptings
they
offer
me
too
much
happiness
i
doubt
the
joy
i
fear
the
glory
my
voice
trembled
the
very
clasp
of
his
hand
unnerved
me
i
will
tell
you
he
said
after
a
brief
pause
what
you
feel
you
are
perfectly
conscious
that
between
you
and
myself
there
is
a
tie
which
no
power
earthly
or
heavenly
can
break
but
you
are
living
in
a
world
with
persons
and
the
influence
they
exert
is
to
make
you
incredulous
of
the
very
truths
which
are
an
essential
part
of
your
spiritual
existence
i
understand
all
this
i
understand
also
why
you
wish
to
go
to
the
house
of
aselzion
and
you
shall
go
i
uttered
an
exclamation
of
relief
and
pleasure
his
eyes
grew
dark
with
earnest
gravity
as
he
looked
at
me
you
are
pleased
at
what
you
can
not
realise
he
said
slowly
if
you
go
to
the
house
of
aselzion
and
i
see
you
are
determined
it
will
be
a
matter
of
such
vital
import
that
it
can
only
mean
one
of
two
things
your
entire
happiness
or
your
entire
misery
i
can
not
contemplate
with
absolute
calmness
the
risk
you
run
and
yet
it
is
better
that
you
should
follow
the
dictates
of
your
own
soul
than
be
as
you
are
now
irresolute
uncertain
of
yourself
and
ready
to
lose
all
you
have
gained
lose
all
i
have
gained
the
old
insidious
terror
i
met
his
searching
gaze
imploringly
i
must
not
lose
anything
i
said
and
my
voice
sank
lower
i
can
not
bear
to
lose
you
his
hand
closed
on
mine
with
a
tighter
grasp
yet
you
doubt
he
said
softly
i
must
know
i
said
resolutely
he
lifted
his
head
with
a
proud
gesture
that
was
curiously
familiar
to
me
so
the
old
spirit
is
not
dead
in
you
my
queen
he
said
smiling
the
old
indomitable
will
the
desire
to
probe
to
the
very
centre
of
things
yet
love
defies
analysis
and
is
the
only
thing
that
binds
the
universe
together
a
fact
beyond
all
proving
a
truth
which
can
not
be
expounded
by
any
given
rule
or
line
but
which
is
the
most
emphatic
force
of
life
my
queen
it
is
a
force
that
must
either
bend
or
break
you
i
made
no
reply
he
still
held
my
hand
and
we
looked
out
together
on
the
shining
expanse
of
the
sea
where
there
was
no
vessel
visible
and
where
our
schooner
alone
flew
over
the
watery
moonlit
surface
like
a
winged
flame
in
your
working
life
he
continued
gently
you
have
done
much
you
have
thought
clearly
and
you
have
not
been
frightened
away
from
any
eternal
fact
by
the
difficulties
of
research
but
in
your
living
life
you
have
missed
more
than
you
will
care
to
know
you
have
been
content
to
remain
a
passive
recipient
of
influences
you
have
not
thoroughly
learned
how
to
combine
and
use
them
you
have
overcome
altogether
what
are
generally
the
chief
obstacles
in
the
way
of
a
woman
higher
progress
her
inherent
childishness
her
delight
in
imagining
herself
wronged
or
neglected
her
absurd
way
of
attaching
weighty
importance
to
the
merest
trifles
her
want
of
balance
and
the
foolish
resentment
she
feels
at
being
told
any
of
her
faults
this
is
all
past
in
you
and
you
stand
free
of
the
shackles
of
sheer
stupidity
which
makes
so
many
women
impossible
to
deal
with
from
a
man
standpoint
and
which
renders
it
almost
necessary
for
men
to
estimate
them
at
a
low
intellectual
standard
for
even
in
the
supreme
passion
of
love
millions
of
women
are
only
capable
of
understanding
its
merely
physical
side
while
the
union
of
soul
with
soul
is
never
consummated
where
is
that
love
supreme
in
which
souls
meet
where
is
it
satisfied
on
heaving
sands
of
lone
desire
spirit
to
spirit
cries
while
float
across
the
skies
bright
phantoms
of
fair
lands
where
fancies
fade
not
and
where
dreams
abide
his
voice
dropped
to
the
softest
musical
cadence
and
i
looked
up
he
answered
my
look
dear
one
he
said
you
shall
go
to
the
house
of
aselzion
and
with
you
will
be
the
future
he
let
go
my
hand
very
gently
i
felt
a
sudden
sense
of
utter
loneliness
you
do
not
you
will
not
misjudge
me
i
said
i
dear
i
have
made
so
many
errors
of
judgment
in
the
past
and
i
have
lost
you
so
many
times
that
i
shall
do
nothing
now
which
might
lose
you
again
he
smiled
and
for
one
moment
i
was
impelled
to
throw
hesitation
to
the
winds
and
say
all
that
i
knew
in
my
inmost
self
ought
to
be
said
but
my
rebellious
will
held
me
back
and
i
remained
silent
while
he
turned
away
and
rejoined
the
rest
of
the
party
with
whom
he
was
soon
chatting
in
such
a
cheery
easy
fashion
that
they
appeared
to
forget
that
there
was
anything
remarkable
about
him
or
about
his
wonderful
vessel
which
had
now
turned
on
her
course
and
was
carrying
us
back
to
loch
scavaig
at
a
speed
which
matched
the
fleetest
wind
when
she
arrived
at
her
former
anchorage
just
opposite
the
we
saw
that
all
the
crew
of
harland
yacht
were
on
deck
watching
our
movements
which
must
have
been
well
worth
watching
considering
what
an
amazing
spectacle
the
made
of
herself
and
her
glittering
sails
against
the
dark
loch
and
mountains
so
brilliant
indeed
as
almost
to
eclipse
the
very
moon
but
the
light
began
to
pale
as
soon
as
we
dropped
anchor
and
very
soon
faded
out
completely
whereupon
the
sailors
hauled
down
canvas
uttering
musical
cries
as
they
pulled
and
braced
it
together
this
work
done
they
retired
and
a
couple
of
servants
waited
upon
our
party
bringing
wine
and
fruit
as
a
parting
refreshment
before
we
said
and
once
again
the
sweet
voice
of
the
egyptian
boy
singer
smote
upon
our
ears
with
a
prelude
of
farewell
if
it
should
chance
that
nevermore
we
meet
remember
that
the
hours
we
spent
together
here
were
sweet
farewell
if
henceforth
different
ways
of
life
we
wend
remember
that
i
sought
to
walk
beside
you
to
the
end
farewell
when
present
things
are
merged
into
the
past
remember
that
i
love
you
and
shall
love
you
to
the
last
my
heart
beat
with
a
quick
and
sudden
agony
of
pain
was
it
could
it
be
true
that
i
was
of
my
own
accord
going
to
sever
myself
from
one
whom
i
knew
whom
i
felt
to
be
all
in
all
to
me
said
a
low
voice
close
to
my
ear
i
started
i
had
lost
myself
in
a
wilderness
of
thought
and
memory
santoris
stood
beside
me
your
friends
are
going
he
said
and
i
too
shall
be
gone
a
wave
of
desolation
overcame
me
ah
no
i
exclaimed
surely
you
will
not
go
i
must
he
answered
quietly
are
not
you
going
it
has
been
a
joy
to
meet
you
if
only
for
a
little
while
a
pause
in
the
journey
an
attempt
at
an
understanding
though
you
have
decided
that
we
must
part
again
i
clasped
my
hands
together
in
a
kind
of
desperation
what
can
i
do
i
murmured
if
i
yielded
now
to
my
own
impulses
ah
if
you
did
he
said
wistfully
but
you
will
not
and
perhaps
after
all
it
is
better
so
it
is
no
doubt
intended
that
you
should
be
absolutely
certain
of
yourself
this
time
and
i
will
not
stand
in
the
way
and
farewell
i
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
though
the
tears
were
in
my
eyes
i
will
not
say
farewell
i
answered
he
raised
my
hands
lightly
to
his
lips
that
is
kind
of
you
he
said
and
you
shall
hear
from
me
about
aselzion
and
the
best
way
for
you
to
see
him
he
is
spending
the
summer
in
europe
which
is
fortunate
for
you
as
you
will
not
have
to
make
so
far
a
journey
we
broke
off
our
conversation
here
as
the
others
joined
us
and
in
a
very
little
while
we
had
left
the
and
were
returning
to
our
own
yacht
to
the
last
as
the
motor
launch
rushed
with
us
through
the
water
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
reposeful
figure
of
santoris
who
with
folded
arms
on
the
deck
rail
of
his
vessel
watched
our
departure
should
i
never
see
him
again
i
wondered
what
was
the
strange
impulse
that
had
more
or
less
moved
my
spirit
to
a
kind
of
opposition
against
his
and
made
me
so
determined
to
seek
out
for
myself
the
things
that
he
assumed
to
have
mastered
i
could
not
tell
i
only
knew
that
from
the
moment
he
had
begun
to
relate
the
personal
narrative
of
his
own
studies
and
experiences
i
had
resolved
to
go
through
the
same
training
whatever
it
was
and
learn
what
he
had
learned
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
i
did
not
think
i
should
succeed
so
well
but
some
new
knowledge
i
felt
i
should
surely
gain
the
extraordinary
attraction
he
exercised
over
me
was
growing
too
strong
to
resist
yet
i
was
determined
not
to
yield
to
it
because
i
doubted
both
its
cause
and
its
effect
love
i
knew
could
not
as
he
had
said
be
analysed
but
the
love
i
had
always
dreamed
of
was
not
the
love
with
which
the
majority
of
mankind
are
content
the
mere
physical
delight
which
ends
in
satiety
it
was
something
not
only
for
time
but
for
eternity
away
from
santoris
i
found
it
quite
easy
to
give
myself
up
to
the
dream
of
joy
which
shone
before
me
like
the
mirage
of
a
promised
land
but
in
his
company
i
felt
as
though
something
held
me
back
and
warned
me
to
beware
of
too
quickly
snatching
at
a
purely
personal
happiness
we
reached
the
in
a
very
few
minutes
we
had
made
the
little
journey
almost
in
silence
for
my
companions
were
or
appeared
to
be
as
much
lost
in
thought
as
i
was
as
we
descended
to
our
cabins
harland
drew
me
back
and
detained
me
alone
for
a
moment
santoris
is
going
away
he
said
he
will
probably
have
set
those
wonderful
sails
of
his
and
flown
before
daybreak
i
sorry
so
am
i
i
answered
but
after
all
you
would
hardly
want
him
to
stay
would
you
his
theories
of
life
are
very
curious
and
upsetting
and
you
all
think
him
a
sort
of
charlatan
playing
with
the
mysteries
of
earth
and
heaven
if
he
is
able
to
read
thoughts
he
can
not
be
altogether
flattered
at
the
opinion
held
of
him
by
brayle
for
example
harland
brows
knitted
perplexedly
he
says
he
could
cure
me
of
my
illness
he
went
on
and
brayle
declares
that
a
cure
is
impossible
you
prefer
to
believe
brayle
of
course
i
queried
brayle
is
a
physician
of
note
he
replied
a
man
who
has
taken
his
degree
in
medicine
and
knows
what
he
is
talking
about
santoris
is
merely
a
mystic
i
smiled
a
little
sadly
i
see
and
i
held
out
my
hand
to
say
he
is
a
century
before
his
time
and
maybe
it
is
better
to
die
than
forestall
a
century
harland
laughed
as
he
pressed
my
hand
cordially
enigmatical
as
usual
he
said
you
and
santoris
ought
to
be
congenial
spirits
perhaps
we
are
i
answered
carelessly
as
i
left
him
stranger
things
than
that
have
happened
xii
a
to
those
who
are
ignorant
of
or
indifferent
to
the
psychic
forces
working
behind
all
humanity
and
creating
the
causes
which
evolve
into
effect
it
can
not
but
seem
strange
even
eccentric
and
abnormal
that
any
one
person
or
any
two
persons
for
that
matter
should
take
the
trouble
to
try
and
ascertain
the
immediate
intention
and
ultimate
object
of
their
lives
the
daily
routine
of
ordinary
working
feeding
and
sleeping
existence
varied
by
little
social
conventions
and
obligations
which
form
a
kind
of
break
to
the
persistent
monotony
of
the
regular
treadmill
round
should
be
they
think
sufficient
for
any
sane
creature
and
if
a
man
or
woman
elects
to
stand
out
of
the
common
ruck
and
say
i
refuse
to
live
in
a
chaos
of
uncertainties
i
will
endeavour
to
know
why
my
particular
atom
of
self
is
considered
a
necessary
if
infinitesimal
part
of
the
universe
such
an
one
is
looked
upon
with
either
distrust
or
derision
in
matters
of
love
especially
where
the
most
halves
persist
in
fitting
themselves
together
as
if
they
could
ever
make
a
perfect
whole
a
woman
is
considered
foolish
if
she
gives
her
affections
where
it
is
expedient
and
a
man
is
looked
upon
as
having
his
career
if
he
allows
a
great
passion
to
dominate
him
instead
of
a
calm
respectable
sort
of
sentiment
which
has
its
fitting
end
in
an
equally
calm
respectable
marriage
these
are
the
laws
and
observances
of
social
order
excellent
in
many
respects
but
frequently
responsible
for
a
great
bulk
of
the
misery
attendant
upon
many
forms
of
human
relationship
it
is
not
however
possible
to
the
ordinary
mind
to
realise
that
somewhere
and
somehow
every
two
component
parts
of
a
whole
must
come
together
sooner
or
later
and
that
herein
may
be
found
the
key
to
most
of
the
great
love
tragedies
of
the
world
the
wrong
halves
mated
the
right
halves
finding
each
other
out
and
rushing
together
recklessly
and
inopportunely
because
of
the
resistless
law
which
draws
them
together
this
is
the
explanation
of
many
a
life
disaster
and
despair
as
well
as
of
many
a
life
splendid
attainment
and
victory
and
the
trouble
or
the
triumph
whichever
it
be
will
never
be
lessened
till
human
beings
learn
that
in
love
which
is
the
greatest
and
most
divine
force
on
earth
or
in
heaven
the
soul
not
the
body
must
first
be
considered
and
that
no
one
can
fulfil
the
higher
possibilities
of
his
or
her
nature
till
each
individual
unit
is
conjoined
with
that
only
other
portion
of
itself
which
is
as
one
with
it
in
thought
and
in
the
intuitive
comprehension
of
its
higher
needs
i
knew
all
this
well
enough
and
had
known
it
for
years
and
it
was
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
dwell
upon
it
as
i
sat
alone
in
my
cabin
that
night
too
restless
to
sleep
and
almost
too
uneasy
even
to
think
what
had
happened
to
me
was
simply
that
i
had
by
a
curious
chance
or
series
of
chances
been
brought
into
connection
again
with
the
individual
soul
of
a
man
whom
i
had
known
and
loved
ages
ago
to
the
psychist
such
a
circumstance
does
not
seem
as
strange
as
it
is
to
the
great
majority
of
people
who
realise
no
greater
force
than
matter
and
who
have
no
comprehension
of
spirit
and
no
wish
to
comprehend
it
though
even
the
dullest
of
these
often
find
themselves
brought
into
contact
with
persons
whom
they
feel
they
have
met
and
known
before
and
are
unable
to
understand
why
they
receive
such
an
impression
in
my
case
i
had
not
only
to
consider
the
one
particular
identity
which
seemed
so
closely
connected
with
my
own
but
also
the
other
individuals
with
whom
i
had
become
more
or
less
reluctantly
associated
catherine
harland
and
brayle
especially
harland
had
unconsciously
to
himself
been
merely
the
link
to
bring
the
broken
bits
of
a
chain
together
his
secretary
swinton
occupied
the
place
of
the
always
necessary
nonentity
in
a
group
of
intellectually
or
psychically
connected
beings
and
i
was
perfectly
sure
without
having
any
actual
reason
for
my
conviction
that
if
i
remained
much
longer
in
catherine
harland
company
her
chance
liking
for
me
would
turn
into
the
old
hatred
with
which
she
had
hated
me
in
a
bygone
time
a
hatred
fostered
by
brayle
who
plainly
scheming
to
marry
her
and
secure
her
fortune
considered
me
in
the
way
as
i
was
of
the
influence
he
desired
to
exercise
over
her
and
her
father
therefore
it
seemed
necessary
i
should
remove
myself
moreover
i
was
resolved
that
all
the
years
i
had
spent
in
trying
to
find
the
way
to
some
of
secrets
should
not
be
wasted
i
would
learn
i
too
what
rafel
santoris
had
learned
in
the
house
of
aselzion
and
then
we
might
perhaps
stand
on
equal
ground
sure
of
ourselves
and
of
each
other
so
ran
my
thoughts
in
the
solitude
and
stillness
of
the
night
a
solitude
and
stillness
so
profound
that
the
gentle
push
of
the
water
against
the
sides
of
the
yacht
almost
noiseless
as
it
was
sounded
rough
and
intrusive
my
was
open
and
i
could
see
the
sinking
moon
showing
through
it
like
a
white
face
in
sorrow
just
then
i
heard
a
low
splash
as
of
oars
i
started
up
and
went
to
the
sofa
where
by
kneeling
on
the
cushions
i
could
look
through
the
porthole
there
gliding
just
beneath
me
was
a
small
boat
and
my
heart
gave
a
sudden
leap
of
joy
as
i
recognised
the
man
who
rowed
it
as
santoris
he
smiled
as
i
looked
down
then
standing
up
in
the
boat
guided
himself
alongside
till
his
head
was
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
he
put
one
hand
on
its
edge
not
asleep
yet
he
said
softly
what
have
you
been
thinking
of
the
moon
and
the
sea
or
any
other
mystery
as
deep
and
incomprehensible
i
stretched
out
my
hand
and
laid
it
on
his
with
an
involuntary
caressing
touch
i
could
not
leave
you
without
another
last
word
he
said
and
i
have
brought
you
a
letter
he
gave
me
a
sealed
envelope
as
he
spoke
which
will
tell
you
how
to
find
aselzion
i
myself
will
write
to
him
also
and
prepare
him
for
your
arrival
when
you
do
see
him
you
will
understand
how
difficult
is
the
task
you
wish
to
undertake
and
if
you
should
fail
the
failure
will
be
a
greater
sadness
to
yourself
than
to
me
for
i
could
make
things
easier
for
you
i
do
not
want
things
made
easy
for
me
i
answered
quickly
i
want
to
do
all
that
you
have
done
i
want
to
prove
myself
worthy
at
least
i
broke
off
and
looked
down
into
his
eyes
he
smiled
well
he
said
are
you
beginning
to
remember
the
happiness
we
have
so
often
thrown
away
for
a
trifle
i
was
silent
though
i
folded
my
hand
closer
over
his
the
soft
white
sleepy
radiance
of
the
moon
on
the
scarcely
moving
water
around
us
made
everything
look
and
unreal
and
i
was
hardly
conscious
of
my
own
existence
for
the
moment
so
completely
did
it
seem
absorbed
by
some
other
influence
stronger
than
any
power
i
had
ever
known
here
are
we
two
he
continued
softly
alone
with
the
night
and
each
other
close
to
the
verge
of
a
perfect
understanding
and
yet
determined
not
to
understand
how
often
that
happens
every
moment
every
hour
all
over
the
world
there
are
souls
like
ours
barred
severally
within
their
own
shut
gardens
refusing
to
open
the
doors
they
talk
over
the
walls
through
the
chinks
and
crannies
and
peep
through
the
keyholes
but
they
will
not
open
the
doors
how
fortunate
am
i
to
find
even
a
open
he
turned
up
his
face
full
of
light
and
laughter
to
mine
and
i
thought
then
how
easy
it
would
be
to
fling
away
all
my
doubts
and
scruples
give
up
the
idea
of
making
any
more
search
for
what
perhaps
i
should
never
find
and
take
the
joy
which
seemed
proffered
and
the
love
which
my
heart
knew
was
its
own
to
claim
yet
something
still
pulled
me
back
and
not
only
pulled
me
back
but
on
and
away
something
which
inwardly
told
me
i
had
much
to
learn
before
i
dared
accept
a
happiness
i
had
not
deserved
nevertheless
some
of
my
thoughts
found
sudden
speech
rafel
i
began
and
then
paused
amazed
at
my
own
boldness
in
thus
addressing
him
he
drew
closer
to
me
the
boat
he
stood
in
swaying
under
him
go
on
he
said
with
a
little
tremor
in
his
voice
my
name
never
sounded
so
sweetly
in
my
own
ears
what
is
it
you
would
have
me
do
nothing
i
answered
half
afraid
of
myself
as
i
spoke
nothing
but
this
just
to
think
that
i
am
not
merely
wilful
or
rebellious
in
parting
from
you
for
a
little
while
for
if
it
is
true
if
what
is
true
he
interposed
gently
if
it
is
true
that
we
are
friends
not
for
a
time
but
for
eternity
i
said
in
steadier
tones
then
it
can
only
be
for
a
little
while
that
we
shall
be
separated
and
then
afterwards
i
shall
be
quite
sure
yes
quite
sure
of
what
you
are
sure
of
now
he
said
as
sure
as
any
immortal
creature
can
be
of
an
immortal
truth
do
you
know
how
long
we
have
been
separated
already
i
shook
my
head
smiling
a
little
well
i
will
not
tell
you
he
answered
it
might
frighten
you
but
by
all
the
powers
of
earth
and
heaven
we
shall
not
traverse
such
distances
apart
again
not
if
i
can
prevent
it
and
can
you
i
asked
half
wistfully
i
can
and
i
will
for
i
am
stronger
than
you
and
the
strongest
wins
your
eyes
look
startled
there
are
glimpses
of
the
moon
in
them
and
they
are
soft
eyes
not
angry
ones
i
have
seen
them
full
of
anger
an
anger
that
stabbed
me
to
the
heart
but
that
was
in
the
days
gone
by
when
i
was
weaker
than
you
this
time
the
position
has
changed
and
am
master
not
yet
i
said
resolutely
withdrawing
my
hand
from
his
i
yield
to
nothing
not
even
to
happiness
till
i
know
a
slight
shadow
darkened
the
attractiveness
of
his
features
that
is
what
the
world
says
of
god
will
not
yield
till
i
know
but
it
is
as
plastic
clay
in
his
hands
all
the
time
and
it
never
knows
i
was
silent
and
there
was
a
pause
in
which
no
sound
was
heard
but
the
movement
of
the
water
under
the
little
boat
in
which
he
stood
then
he
said
i
answered
and
moved
by
a
swift
impulse
i
stooped
and
kissed
the
firm
hand
that
rested
so
near
me
gripping
the
edge
of
the
he
looked
up
with
a
sudden
light
in
his
eyes
is
that
a
sign
of
grace
and
consolation
he
asked
smiling
well
i
am
content
and
i
have
waited
so
long
that
i
can
wait
yet
a
little
longer
so
speaking
he
let
go
his
hold
from
alongside
the
yacht
and
in
another
minute
had
seated
himself
in
the
boat
and
was
rowing
away
across
the
moonlit
water
i
watched
him
as
every
stroke
of
the
oars
widened
the
distance
between
us
half
hoping
that
he
might
look
back
wave
his
hand
or
even
return
again
but
no
his
boat
soon
vanished
like
a
small
black
speck
on
the
sea
and
i
knew
myself
to
be
left
alone
restraining
with
difficulty
the
tears
that
rose
to
my
eyes
i
shut
the
and
drew
its
little
curtain
across
it
then
i
sat
down
to
read
the
letter
he
had
left
with
me
it
ran
as
follows
beloved
i
call
you
by
this
name
as
i
have
always
called
you
through
many
cycles
of
time
it
should
sound
upon
your
ears
as
familiarly
as
a
note
of
music
struck
in
response
to
another
similar
note
in
far
distance
you
are
not
satisfied
with
the
proofs
given
you
by
your
own
inner
consciousness
which
testify
to
the
unalterable
fact
that
you
and
i
are
and
must
be
as
one
that
we
have
played
with
fate
against
each
other
and
sometimes
striven
to
escape
from
each
other
all
in
vain
it
is
not
enough
for
you
to
know
as
you
do
know
that
the
moment
our
eyes
met
our
spirits
rushed
together
in
a
sudden
ecstasy
which
had
we
dared
to
yield
to
it
would
have
outleaped
convention
and
made
of
us
no
more
than
two
flames
in
one
fire
if
you
are
honest
with
yourself
as
i
am
honest
with
myself
you
will
admit
that
this
is
so
that
the
emotion
which
overwhelmed
us
was
reasonless
formless
and
wholly
beyond
all
analysis
yet
more
insistent
than
any
other
force
having
claim
on
our
lives
but
it
is
not
sufficient
for
you
to
realise
this
or
to
trace
through
every
step
of
the
journey
you
have
made
the
gradual
leading
of
your
soul
to
mine
from
that
last
night
you
passed
in
your
own
home
when
every
fibre
of
your
being
grew
warm
with
the
prescience
of
coming
joy
to
this
present
moment
even
through
dreams
of
infinite
benediction
in
which
i
shared
no
it
is
not
sufficient
for
you
you
must
you
must
learn
you
must
probe
into
deeper
mysteries
and
study
and
suffer
to
the
last
well
if
it
must
be
so
it
must
and
i
shall
rely
on
the
eternal
fitness
of
things
to
save
you
from
your
own
possible
rashness
and
bring
you
back
to
me
for
without
you
now
i
can
do
nothing
more
i
have
done
much
and
much
remains
to
be
done
but
if
i
am
to
attain
you
must
crown
the
attainment
if
my
ambition
is
to
find
completion
you
alone
can
be
its
completeness
if
you
have
the
strength
and
the
courage
to
face
the
ordeal
through
which
aselzion
sends
those
who
seek
to
follow
his
teaching
you
will
indeed
have
justified
your
claim
to
be
considered
higher
than
merest
woman
though
you
have
risen
above
that
level
already
the
lives
of
women
generally
and
of
men
too
are
so
small
and
sordid
and
thanks
to
their
obstinate
refusal
to
see
anything
better
or
wider
than
their
own
immediate
outlook
that
it
is
hardly
worth
while
considering
them
in
the
light
of
that
deeper
knowledge
which
teaches
of
the
real
life
behind
the
seeming
one
in
the
ordinary
way
of
existence
men
and
women
meet
and
mate
with
very
little
more
intelligence
or
thought
about
it
than
the
lower
animals
and
the
results
of
such
meeting
and
mating
are
seen
in
the
degenerate
and
dying
nations
of
moreover
they
are
content
to
be
born
for
no
other
visible
reason
than
to
die
and
no
matter
how
often
they
may
be
told
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
they
receive
the
assertion
with
as
much
indignant
incredulity
as
the
priesthood
of
rome
received
assurance
that
the
earth
moves
round
the
sun
but
we
you
and
i
who
know
that
life
being
all
life
can
not
die
ought
to
be
wiser
in
our
present
space
of
time
than
to
doubt
each
other
infinite
capability
for
love
and
the
perfect
world
of
beauty
which
love
creates
do
not
doubt
my
doubting
days
are
past
and
the
whips
of
sorrow
have
lashed
me
into
shape
as
well
as
into
strength
but
you
hesitate
because
you
have
been
rendered
weak
by
much
misunderstanding
however
it
has
partially
comforted
me
to
place
the
position
fully
before
you
and
having
done
this
i
feel
that
you
must
be
free
to
go
your
own
way
i
do
not
say
love
you
such
a
phrase
from
me
would
be
merest
folly
knowing
that
you
must
be
mine
whether
now
or
at
the
end
of
many
more
centuries
your
soul
is
deathless
as
mine
is
it
is
eternally
young
as
mine
is
and
the
force
that
gives
us
life
and
love
is
divine
and
indestructible
so
that
for
us
there
can
be
no
end
to
the
happiness
which
is
ours
to
claim
when
we
will
for
the
rest
i
leave
you
to
decide
you
will
go
to
the
house
of
aselzion
and
perhaps
you
will
remain
there
some
time
at
any
rate
when
you
depart
from
thence
you
will
have
learned
much
and
you
will
know
what
is
best
for
yourself
and
for
me
my
beloved
i
commend
you
to
god
with
all
my
adoring
soul
and
am
your
lover
rafel
santoris
a
folded
paper
fell
out
of
this
letter
it
contained
full
instructions
as
to
the
way
i
should
go
on
the
journey
i
intended
to
make
to
the
mysterious
house
of
aselzion
and
i
was
glad
to
find
that
i
should
not
have
to
travel
as
far
as
i
had
at
first
imagined
i
began
at
once
to
make
my
plans
for
leaving
the
harlands
as
soon
as
possible
and
before
going
to
bed
i
wrote
to
my
friend
francesca
who
i
knew
would
certainly
expect
me
to
visit
her
in
as
soon
as
my
cruise
in
the
harlands
yacht
was
over
and
briefly
stated
that
business
of
an
important
nature
called
me
abroad
for
two
or
three
weeks
but
that
i
fully
anticipated
being
at
home
in
england
again
before
the
end
of
october
as
it
was
now
just
verging
on
the
end
of
august
i
thought
i
was
allowing
myself
a
fairly
wide
margin
for
absence
when
i
had
folded
and
sealed
my
letter
ready
for
posting
an
irresistible
sense
of
sleep
came
over
me
and
i
yielded
to
it
gratefully
i
found
myself
too
overcome
by
it
even
to
think
and
i
laid
my
head
down
upon
the
pillows
with
a
peaceful
consciousness
that
all
was
well
that
all
would
be
well
and
that
in
trying
to
make
sure
of
the
intentions
of
fate
towards
me
both
in
life
and
love
i
could
not
be
considered
as
altogether
foolish
of
course
judged
by
the
majority
of
people
i
know
i
am
already
counted
as
worse
than
foolish
for
the
impressions
and
experiences
i
here
undertake
to
narrate
but
that
kind
of
judgment
does
not
affect
me
seeing
that
their
own
daily
and
hourly
folly
is
so
visibly
pronounced
and
has
such
unsatisfactory
and
frequently
disastrous
results
that
mine
if
it
indeed
be
folly
to
choose
lasting
and
eternal
things
rather
than
ephemeral
and
temporal
ones
can
not
but
seem
light
in
comparison
love
as
the
world
generally
conceives
of
it
is
hardly
worth
having
for
if
we
become
devoted
to
persons
who
must
in
time
be
severed
from
us
by
death
or
other
causes
we
have
merely
wasted
the
wealth
of
our
affections
only
as
a
perfect
eternal
binding
force
is
love
of
any
value
and
unless
one
can
be
sure
in
one
own
self
that
there
is
the
strength
and
truth
and
courage
to
make
it
thus
perfect
eternal
and
binding
it
is
better
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
what
after
all
is
the
divinest
of
divine
passions
the
passion
of
creativeness
from
which
springs
all
thought
all
endeavour
all
accomplishment
when
i
woke
the
next
morning
i
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
the
had
set
her
wonderful
sails
and
flown
a
sense
of
utter
desolation
was
in
the
air
and
my
own
loneliness
was
impressed
upon
me
with
overwhelming
bitterness
and
force
it
was
a
calm
brilliant
morning
and
when
i
went
up
on
deck
the
magnificent
scenery
of
loch
scavaig
was
to
my
thinking
lessened
in
effect
by
the
excessive
glare
of
the
sun
the
water
was
smooth
as
oil
and
where
the
had
been
anchored
showing
her
beautiful
lines
and
tapering
spars
against
the
background
of
the
mountains
there
was
now
a
dreary
vacancy
the
whole
scene
looked
intolerably
dull
and
lifeless
and
i
was
impatient
to
be
away
from
it
i
said
as
much
at
breakfast
a
meal
at
which
catherine
harland
never
appeared
and
where
i
was
accustomed
to
take
the
head
of
the
table
at
harland
request
to
dispense
the
tea
and
coffee
brayle
seemed
malignly
amused
at
my
remark
the
interest
of
the
place
has
evidently
vanished
with
santoris
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
he
said
he
is
certainly
a
remarkable
man
and
owns
a
remarkable
yacht
but
beyond
that
i
am
not
sure
that
his
room
is
not
better
than
his
company
i
daresay
you
feel
it
so
said
harland
who
had
for
some
moments
been
unusually
taciturn
and
preoccupied
your
theories
are
diametrically
opposed
to
his
and
for
that
matter
so
are
mine
but
i
confess
i
should
like
to
have
tested
his
medical
skill
he
assured
me
positively
that
he
could
cure
me
of
my
illness
in
three
months
why
do
you
not
let
him
try
suggested
brayle
with
an
air
of
forced
lightness
he
will
be
a
man
of
miracles
if
he
can
cure
what
the
whole
medical
profession
knows
to
be
incurable
but
i
quite
willing
to
retire
in
his
favour
if
you
wish
it
harland
bristling
eyebrows
met
over
his
nose
in
a
saturnine
frown
well
are
you
willing
he
said
i
rather
doubt
it
and
if
you
are
i
not
i
no
faith
in
mysticism
or
psychism
of
any
kind
it
bores
me
to
think
about
it
and
nothing
has
puzzled
me
at
all
concerning
santoris
except
his
extraordinarily
youthful
appearance
that
is
a
problem
to
me
and
i
should
like
to
solve
it
he
looks
about
or
forty
said
brayle
and
i
should
say
that
is
his
age
that
his
age
harland
gave
a
short
derisive
laugh
why
he
over
sixty
if
he
a
day
that
the
mystery
of
it
there
is
not
a
touch
of
about
him
instead
of
growing
old
he
grows
young
brayle
looked
up
quizzically
at
his
patron
i
already
hinted
he
said
that
he
may
not
be
the
santoris
you
knew
at
oxford
he
may
be
a
relative
cleverly
masquerading
as
the
original
man
that
wo
stand
a
moment
argument
interposed
harland
and
i
tell
you
how
i
know
it
wo
we
had
a
quarrel
once
and
i
slashed
his
arm
with
a
pretty
heavily
here
a
sudden
quiver
of
something
shame
or
remorse
perhaps
came
over
his
hard
face
and
changed
its
expression
for
a
moment
it
was
all
my
fault
i
had
a
devilish
temper
and
he
was
calm
his
calmness
irritated
me
moreover
i
was
drunk
santoris
knew
i
was
drunk
and
he
wanted
to
get
me
home
to
my
rooms
and
to
bed
before
i
made
too
great
a
disgrace
of
myself
then
that
happened
i
remember
the
blood
pouring
from
his
arm
it
frightened
me
and
sobered
me
well
when
he
came
on
board
here
the
other
night
he
showed
me
the
scar
of
the
very
wound
i
had
inflicted
so
i
know
he
the
same
man
we
all
sat
silent
he
was
always
studying
the
went
on
harland
and
i
was
scarcely
surprised
that
he
should
out
that
antique
piece
of
jewellery
from
your
pocket
last
night
he
actually
told
me
it
belonged
to
you
ages
ago
when
you
were
quite
another
and
more
important
person
brayle
laughed
loudly
almost
boisterously
what
a
fictionist
the
man
must
be
he
exclaimed
why
does
he
write
a
novel
swinton
i
wish
you
would
take
a
few
notes
for
me
of
what
santoris
said
about
that
collar
of
jewels
i
should
like
to
keep
the
record
swinton
smiled
an
obliging
assent
i
certainly
will
he
said
i
was
fortunately
present
when
santoris
expressed
his
curious
ideas
about
the
jewels
to
mr
harland
oh
well
if
you
are
going
to
record
it
said
harland
half
laughingly
you
had
better
be
careful
to
put
it
all
down
the
collar
according
to
santoris
belonged
to
brayle
when
his
personality
was
that
of
an
italian
nobleman
residing
in
florence
about
the
year
he
wore
it
on
one
unfortunate
occasion
when
he
murdered
a
man
and
the
jewels
have
not
had
much
of
a
career
since
that
period
now
they
have
come
back
into
his
possession
father
who
told
you
all
this
the
voice
was
sharp
and
thin
and
we
turned
round
amazed
to
see
catherine
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
saloon
white
and
trembling
with
wild
eyes
looking
as
though
they
saw
ghosts
brayle
hastened
to
her
miss
harland
pray
go
back
to
your
cabin
you
are
not
strong
enough
what
the
matter
catherine
asked
her
father
i
only
repeating
some
of
the
nonsense
santoris
told
me
about
that
collar
of
jewels
it
not
nonsense
cried
catherine
it
all
true
i
remember
it
all
we
planned
the
murder
together
he
and
i
and
she
pointed
to
brayle
i
told
him
how
the
lovers
used
to
meet
in
secret
the
poor
hunted
things
how
he
that
great
artist
he
patronised
came
to
her
room
from
the
garden
entrance
at
night
and
how
they
talked
for
hours
behind
the
in
the
avenue
and
she
she
i
hated
her
because
i
thought
you
loved
her
you
and
again
she
turned
to
brayle
clutching
at
his
arm
yes
i
thought
you
loved
her
but
she
she
loved
him
and
here
she
paused
shuddering
violently
and
seemed
to
lose
herself
in
chaotic
ideas
and
so
the
yacht
has
gone
and
there
is
peace
and
perhaps
we
shall
forget
again
we
were
allowed
to
forget
for
a
little
while
but
it
has
all
come
back
to
haunt
and
terrify
us
and
with
these
words
which
broke
off
in
a
kind
of
inarticulate
cry
she
sank
downward
in
a
swoon
brayle
managing
to
save
her
from
falling
quite
to
the
ground
everything
was
at
once
in
confusion
and
while
the
servants
were
busy
hurrying
to
and
fro
for
cold
water
smelling
salts
and
other
reviving
cordials
and
catherine
was
being
laid
on
the
sofa
and
attended
to
by
brayle
i
slipped
away
and
went
up
on
deck
feeling
myself
quite
overpowered
and
bewildered
by
the
suddenness
and
strangeness
of
the
episodes
in
which
i
had
become
involved
in
a
minute
or
two
harland
followed
me
looking
troubled
and
perplexed
what
does
all
this
mean
he
said
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
catherine
condition
she
is
hysterical
of
course
but
what
has
caused
it
what
mad
idea
has
she
got
into
her
head
about
a
murder
i
looked
away
from
him
across
the
sunlit
expanse
of
sea
i
really
can
not
tell
you
i
said
at
last
i
am
quite
as
much
in
the
dark
as
you
are
i
think
she
is
overwrought
and
that
she
has
perhaps
taken
some
of
the
things
santoris
said
too
much
to
heart
then
here
i
hesitated
she
said
the
other
day
that
she
was
tired
of
this
yachting
trip
in
fact
i
think
it
is
simply
a
case
of
nerves
she
must
have
very
odd
nerves
if
they
persuade
her
to
believe
that
she
and
brayle
committed
a
murder
together
ages
ago
said
harland
irritably
i
never
heard
of
such
nonsense
in
all
my
life
i
was
silent
i
have
told
captain
derrick
to
weigh
anchor
and
get
out
of
this
he
continued
brusquely
we
shall
make
for
portree
at
once
there
is
something
and
uncanny
about
the
place
and
he
looked
round
as
he
spoke
at
the
splendour
of
the
mountains
shining
with
almost
crystalline
clearness
in
the
glory
of
the
morning
sun
i
feel
as
if
it
were
haunted
by
what
i
asked
by
memories
he
answered
and
not
altogether
pleasant
ones
i
looked
at
him
and
a
moment
thought
decided
me
that
the
opportunity
had
come
for
me
to
broach
the
subject
of
my
intended
departure
and
i
did
so
i
said
that
i
felt
i
had
allowed
myself
sufficient
holiday
and
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
take
the
ordinary
steamer
from
portree
the
morning
after
our
arrival
there
in
order
to
reach
glasgow
as
soon
as
possible
harland
surveyed
me
inquisitively
why
do
you
want
to
go
by
the
steamer
he
asked
why
not
go
with
us
back
to
rothesay
for
example
i
would
rather
lose
no
time
i
said
then
i
added
impulsively
dear
harland
catherine
will
be
much
better
when
i
am
gone
i
know
she
will
you
will
be
able
to
prolong
the
yachting
trip
which
will
benefit
your
health
and
i
should
be
really
most
unhappy
if
you
curtailed
it
on
my
account
he
interrupted
me
why
do
you
say
that
catherine
will
be
better
when
you
are
gone
he
demanded
it
was
her
own
most
particular
wish
that
you
should
accompany
us
she
did
not
know
what
moved
her
to
such
a
desire
i
said
then
seeing
his
look
of
astonishment
i
smiled
i
am
not
a
congenial
spirit
to
her
nor
to
any
of
you
really
but
she
has
been
most
kind
and
so
have
you
and
i
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
all
you
have
done
for
me
you
have
done
much
more
than
you
know
only
i
feel
it
is
better
to
go
now
now
before
before
what
he
asked
well
before
we
all
hate
each
other
i
said
playfully
it
is
quite
on
the
cards
that
we
shall
come
to
that
brayle
thinks
my
presence
quite
as
harmful
to
catherine
as
that
of
santoris
i
am
full
of
which
he
considers
prejudicial
and
so
perhaps
they
are
to
him
harland
drew
closer
to
me
where
i
stood
leaning
against
the
deck
rail
and
spoke
in
a
lower
tone
tell
me
he
said
and
be
perfectly
frank
about
it
what
is
it
you
see
in
brayle
that
rouses
such
a
spirit
of
antagonism
in
you
if
i
give
you
a
straight
answer
such
as
i
feel
to
be
the
truth
in
myself
will
you
be
offended
i
asked
he
shook
his
head
no
he
answered
i
shall
not
be
offended
i
simply
want
to
know
what
you
think
and
i
shall
remember
what
you
say
and
see
if
it
proves
correct
well
in
the
first
place
i
said
i
see
nothing
in
brayle
but
what
can
be
seen
in
hundreds
of
men
such
as
he
but
he
is
not
a
true
physician
for
he
makes
no
real
effort
to
cure
you
of
your
illness
while
catherine
has
no
illness
at
all
that
demands
a
cure
he
merely
humours
the
weakness
of
her
nerves
a
weakness
she
has
created
by
dwelling
morbidly
on
her
own
self
and
her
own
particular
miseries
and
all
his
future
plans
with
regard
to
her
and
to
you
are
settled
they
are
quite
clear
and
reasonable
you
will
die
in
fact
it
is
in
his
opinion
necessary
for
you
to
die
it
would
be
very
troublesome
and
inconvenient
to
him
if
by
some
chance
you
were
cured
and
continued
to
live
when
you
are
gone
he
will
marry
catherine
your
only
child
and
heiress
and
he
will
have
no
further
personal
anxieties
i
dislike
this
attitude
on
his
part
and
my
only
wonder
is
that
you
do
not
perceive
it
for
the
rest
my
antagonism
to
brayle
is
instinctive
and
has
its
origin
far
back
perhaps
in
a
bygone
existence
he
listened
to
my
words
with
attentive
patience
well
i
shall
study
the
man
more
carefully
he
said
after
a
pause
you
may
be
right
at
present
i
think
you
are
wrong
as
for
any
cure
for
me
i
know
there
is
none
i
have
consulted
medical
works
on
the
subject
and
am
perfectly
convinced
that
brayle
is
doing
his
best
he
can
do
no
more
and
now
one
word
to
yourself
here
he
laid
a
hand
kindly
on
mine
i
have
noticed
i
could
not
help
noticing
that
you
were
greatly
taken
by
santoris
and
i
should
almost
have
fancied
him
rather
fascinated
by
you
had
i
not
known
him
to
be
absolutely
indifferent
to
womenkind
but
let
me
tell
you
he
is
not
a
safe
friend
or
guide
for
anyone
his
theories
are
extravagant
and
impossible
his
idea
that
there
is
no
death
for
example
when
death
stares
us
in
the
face
every
day
is
perfectly
absurd
and
he
is
likely
to
lead
you
into
much
perplexity
the
more
so
as
you
are
too
much
of
a
believer
in
occult
things
already
i
wish
i
could
persuade
you
to
listen
to
me
seriously
on
one
or
two
points
i
smiled
i
am
listening
i
said
well
child
you
listen
perhaps
but
you
are
not
convinced
realise
if
you
can
that
these
fantastic
chimeras
of
a
past
and
future
life
exist
only
in
the
heated
imagination
of
the
abnormal
idealist
there
is
nothing
beyond
our
actual
sight
and
immediate
living
consciousness
we
know
we
are
born
and
that
we
die
but
why
we
can
not
tell
and
never
shall
be
able
to
tell
we
must
try
and
manage
the
the
gap
dividing
birth
and
death
as
best
we
can
and
that
all
i
wish
you
would
settle
down
to
these
facts
reasonably
you
would
be
far
better
balanced
in
mind
and
action
if
i
thought
as
you
do
i
interrupted
him
i
would
jump
from
this
vessel
into
the
sea
and
let
the
waters
close
over
me
there
would
be
neither
use
nor
sense
in
living
for
an
leading
merely
to
nothingness
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
brows
perplexedly
it
certainly
seems
useless
he
admitted
but
there
it
is
it
is
better
to
accept
it
than
run
amok
among
inexplicable
infinities
we
were
interrupted
here
by
the
sailors
busying
themselves
in
preparations
for
getting
the
yacht
under
way
and
our
conversation
being
thus
broken
off
abruptly
was
not
again
resumed
by
eleven
we
were
steaming
out
of
loch
scavaig
and
as
i
looked
back
on
the
sombre
that
stood
round
the
deeply
hidden
magnificence
of
loch
coruisk
i
wondered
if
my
visionary
experience
there
had
been
only
the
work
of
my
own
excited
imagination
or
whether
it
really
had
foundation
in
fact
the
letter
from
santoris
lay
against
my
heart
as
actual
testimony
that
he
at
least
was
real
that
i
had
met
and
known
him
and
that
so
far
as
anything
could
be
believed
he
had
declared
himself
my
but
was
ever
love
so
expressed
and
had
it
ever
before
such
a
beginning
i
soon
ceased
to
perplex
myself
with
futile
speculations
on
the
subject
however
and
as
the
last
peaks
of
the
scavaig
hills
vanished
in
pale
blue
distance
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
brought
suddenly
back
from
a
fairyland
to
a
curiously
dull
and
commonplace
world
everyone
on
board
the
seemed
occupied
with
the
veriest
trifles
catherine
remained
too
ill
to
appear
all
day
and
brayle
was
in
almost
constant
attendance
upon
her
a
vague
sense
of
discomfort
pervaded
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
yacht
she
was
a
floating
palace
filled
with
every
imaginable
luxury
yet
now
she
seemed
a
mere
tawdry
triumph
compared
with
the
exquisite
grace
and
taste
of
the
and
i
was
eager
to
be
away
from
her
i
busied
myself
during
the
day
in
packing
my
things
ready
for
departure
with
the
eagerness
of
a
child
leaving
school
for
the
holidays
and
i
was
delighted
when
we
arrived
at
portree
and
anchored
there
that
evening
it
was
after
dinner
at
about
nine
that
catherine
sent
for
me
hearing
i
had
determined
to
go
next
morning
i
found
her
in
her
bed
looking
very
white
and
feeble
with
a
scared
look
in
her
eyes
which
became
intensified
the
moment
she
saw
me
you
are
really
going
away
she
said
faintly
i
hope
we
have
not
offended
you
i
went
up
to
her
took
her
poor
thin
hand
and
kissed
it
no
indeed
i
answered
why
should
i
be
offended
father
is
vexed
you
are
going
she
went
on
he
says
it
is
all
my
silly
nonsense
and
hysterical
fancies
do
you
think
it
is
i
prefer
not
to
say
what
i
think
i
replied
gently
dear
catherine
there
are
some
things
in
life
which
can
not
be
explained
and
it
is
better
not
to
try
and
explain
them
but
believe
me
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
for
this
yachting
trip
you
have
done
more
for
me
than
you
will
ever
know
and
so
far
from
being
i
am
grateful
grateful
beyond
all
words
she
held
my
hands
looking
at
me
wistfully
you
will
go
away
she
said
in
a
low
tone
and
we
shall
perhaps
never
meet
again
i
do
think
it
likely
we
shall
people
often
try
to
meet
again
and
never
do
have
you
noticed
that
it
seems
fated
that
they
shall
only
know
each
other
for
a
little
while
just
to
serve
some
purpose
and
then
part
altogether
besides
you
live
in
a
different
world
from
ours
you
believe
in
things
that
i
ca
even
understand
you
think
there
is
a
god
and
you
think
each
human
being
has
a
soul
are
you
not
taught
the
same
in
your
churches
i
interrupted
she
looked
startled
oh
yes
but
then
one
never
thinks
seriously
about
it
you
know
that
if
we
did
think
seriously
about
it
we
could
never
live
as
we
do
one
goes
to
church
for
convention
sake
because
it
respectable
but
suppose
you
were
to
say
to
a
clergyman
that
if
your
soul
is
it
follows
in
reason
that
it
must
always
have
existed
and
always
will
exist
he
would
declare
you
to
be
that
where
all
the
puzzle
and
contradiction
comes
in
so
that
i
do
believe
in
the
soul
at
all
are
you
sure
you
do
not
i
enquired
meaningly
she
was
silent
then
she
suddenly
broke
out
well
i
do
want
to
believe
in
it
i
do
want
to
think
about
it
i
rather
not
it
terrible
if
a
soul
has
never
died
and
never
will
die
its
burden
of
memories
must
be
awful
horrible
no
hell
could
be
worse
but
suppose
they
are
beautiful
and
happy
memories
i
suggested
she
shuddered
they
could
be
we
all
fail
somewhere
this
was
true
enough
and
i
offered
no
comment
i
feel
she
went
on
hesitatingly
that
you
are
leaving
us
for
some
undiscovered
country
and
that
you
will
reach
some
plane
of
thought
and
action
to
which
we
shall
never
rise
i
do
think
i
am
sorry
for
this
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
want
to
rise
i
should
be
perfectly
content
to
live
a
few
years
in
a
moderate
state
of
happiness
and
then
drop
into
oblivion
and
i
think
most
people
are
like
me
very
unambitious
i
said
smiling
yes
i
daresay
it
is
but
one
gets
tired
of
it
all
tired
of
things
and
people
at
least
i
do
now
that
man
santoris
despite
myself
i
felt
the
warm
blood
flushing
my
cheeks
yes
what
of
him
i
queried
lightly
well
i
can
understand
that
he
has
always
been
alive
and
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
me
with
an
expression
of
positive
dread
immensely
actively
perpetually
alive
he
seems
to
hold
some
mastery
over
the
very
air
i
am
afraid
of
him
terribly
afraid
it
is
a
relief
to
me
to
know
that
he
and
his
strange
yacht
have
gone
but
catherine
i
ventured
to
say
the
yacht
was
not
really
it
was
only
moved
by
a
different
application
of
electricity
from
that
which
the
world
at
present
knows
you
would
not
call
it
if
the
discovery
made
by
santoris
were
generally
adopted
she
sighed
perhaps
not
but
just
now
it
seems
a
sort
of
devil
magic
to
me
anyhow
i
glad
he
gone
you
sorry
i
suppose
in
a
way
i
am
i
answered
quietly
i
thought
him
very
kind
and
charming
and
courteous
no
one
could
be
a
better
host
or
a
pleasanter
companion
and
i
certainly
saw
nothing
about
him
as
for
that
collar
of
jewels
there
are
plenty
of
who
could
have
found
out
its
existence
and
said
as
much
of
it
as
he
did
she
uttered
a
low
cry
do
speak
of
it
she
said
for
heaven
sake
do
speak
of
it
she
buried
her
face
in
her
pillow
and
i
waited
silently
for
her
to
recover
when
she
turned
again
towards
me
she
said
i
am
not
well
yet
i
can
not
bear
too
much
i
only
want
you
to
know
before
you
go
away
that
i
have
no
unkind
feeling
towards
you
things
seem
pushing
me
that
way
but
i
have
not
really
and
you
surely
will
believe
me
surely
i
said
earnestly
dear
catherine
do
not
worry
yourself
these
impressions
of
yours
will
pass
i
hope
so
she
said
i
shall
try
to
forget
and
you
you
will
meet
santoris
again
do
you
think
i
hesitated
i
do
not
know
you
seem
to
have
some
attraction
for
each
other
she
went
on
and
i
suppose
your
beliefs
are
alike
to
me
they
are
dreadful
beliefs
worse
than
barbarism
i
looked
at
her
with
all
the
compassion
i
truly
felt
why
because
we
believe
that
god
is
all
love
and
tenderness
and
justice
because
we
can
not
think
he
would
have
created
life
only
to
end
in
death
because
we
are
sure
that
he
allows
nothing
to
be
wasted
not
even
a
thought
and
nothing
to
go
unrecompensed
either
in
good
or
in
evil
surely
these
are
not
barbarous
beliefs
a
curious
look
came
over
her
face
if
i
believed
in
anything
she
said
i
would
rather
be
orthodox
and
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
and
the
atonement
then
you
would
start
with
the
idea
that
the
supreme
and
creator
could
not
make
a
perfect
work
i
said
and
that
he
was
obliged
to
invent
a
scheme
to
redeem
his
own
failure
catherine
if
you
speak
of
barbarism
this
is
the
most
barbarous
belief
of
all
she
stared
at
me
amazed
you
would
be
put
out
of
any
church
in
christendom
for
such
a
speech
as
that
she
said
possibly
i
answered
quietly
but
i
should
not
and
could
not
be
put
out
of
god
universe
nor
i
am
certain
would
he
reject
my
eternal
love
and
adoration
a
silence
fell
between
us
then
i
heard
her
sobbing
i
put
my
arm
round
her
and
she
laid
her
head
on
my
shoulder
i
wish
i
could
feel
as
you
do
she
whispered
you
must
be
very
happy
the
world
is
all
beautiful
in
your
eyes
and
of
course
with
your
ideas
it
will
continue
to
be
beautiful
and
even
death
will
only
come
to
you
as
another
transition
into
life
but
you
must
not
think
anybody
will
ever
understand
you
or
believe
you
or
follow
you
people
will
only
look
upon
you
as
mad
or
the
dupe
of
your
own
foolish
imagination
i
smiled
as
i
smoothed
her
pillow
for
her
and
laid
her
gently
back
upon
it
i
can
stand
that
i
said
if
somebody
who
is
lost
in
the
dark
jeers
at
me
for
finding
the
light
i
shall
not
mind
we
did
not
speak
much
after
that
and
when
i
said
to
her
i
also
said
as
i
knew
i
should
have
to
leave
the
yacht
early
in
the
morning
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
time
at
my
disposal
in
talking
to
harland
keeping
our
conversation
always
on
the
level
of
ordinary
topics
he
seemed
genuinely
sorry
that
i
had
determined
to
go
and
if
he
could
have
persuaded
me
to
stay
on
board
a
few
days
longer
i
am
sure
he
would
have
been
pleased
i
shall
see
you
off
in
the
morning
he
said
and
believe
me
i
shall
miss
you
very
much
we
do
agree
on
certain
subjects
but
i
like
you
all
the
same
that
something
i
said
cheerfully
it
would
never
do
if
we
were
all
of
the
same
opinion
will
you
meet
santoris
again
do
you
think
this
was
the
same
question
catherine
had
put
to
me
and
i
answered
it
in
the
same
manner
i
really
do
know
would
you
like
to
meet
him
again
he
urged
i
hesitated
smiling
a
little
yes
i
think
so
it
is
curious
he
pursued
that
i
should
have
been
the
means
of
bringing
you
together
your
theories
of
life
and
death
are
so
alike
that
you
must
have
thoughts
in
common
many
years
have
passed
since
i
knew
santoris
in
fact
i
had
completely
lost
sight
of
him
though
i
had
never
forgotten
his
powerful
personality
and
it
seemt
rather
odd
to
me
that
he
should
suddenly
turn
up
again
while
you
were
with
me
mere
coincidence
i
said
lightly
and
common
enough
after
all
like
attracts
like
you
know
that
may
be
there
is
certainly
something
in
the
law
of
attraction
between
human
beings
which
we
do
not
understand
he
answered
musingly
perhaps
if
we
did
he
broke
off
and
relapsed
into
silence
that
night
just
before
going
to
bed
i
was
met
by
brayle
in
the
corridor
leading
to
my
cabin
i
was
about
to
pass
him
with
a
brief
but
he
stopped
me
so
you
are
really
going
he
said
with
a
furtive
narrowing
of
his
eyelids
as
he
looked
at
me
well
perhaps
it
is
best
you
are
a
very
disturbing
magnet
i
smiled
am
i
in
what
way
i
can
not
tell
you
without
seeming
to
give
the
lie
to
reason
he
answered
brusquely
i
believe
to
a
certain
extent
in
magnetism
in
fact
i
have
myself
tested
its
power
in
purely
nervous
patients
but
i
have
never
accepted
the
idea
that
persons
can
silently
and
almost
without
conscious
effort
influence
others
for
either
malign
or
beneficial
purposes
in
your
presence
however
the
thing
is
forced
upon
me
as
though
it
were
a
truth
while
i
know
it
to
be
a
fallacy
is
it
too
late
to
talk
about
such
things
i
asked
wishing
to
cut
short
the
conversation
perhaps
it
is
but
i
shall
probably
never
have
the
chance
to
say
what
i
wish
to
say
he
replied
and
he
leaned
against
the
stairway
just
where
the
light
in
the
saloon
sent
forth
a
bright
ray
upon
his
face
showing
it
to
be
dark
with
a
certain
frowning
perplexity
you
have
studied
many
things
in
your
own
impulsive
feminine
fashion
and
you
are
beyond
all
the
stupidity
of
the
agreeable
female
who
thinks
a
prettily
feigned
ignorance
becoming
so
that
i
can
speak
frankly
i
can
now
tell
you
that
from
the
first
day
i
saw
you
i
felt
i
had
known
you
before
and
you
filled
me
with
a
curious
emotion
of
mingled
liking
and
repulsion
one
night
when
you
were
sitting
with
us
on
deck
it
was
before
we
met
that
fellow
santoris
i
watched
you
with
singular
interest
every
turn
of
your
head
every
look
of
your
eyes
seemed
familiar
and
for
a
moment
i
i
almost
loved
you
oh
you
need
not
mind
my
saying
this
and
he
laughed
a
little
at
my
involuntary
exclamation
it
was
nothing
it
was
only
a
passing
mood
for
in
another
few
seconds
i
hated
you
as
keenly
there
you
have
it
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
have
been
visited
by
these
singular
experiences
but
i
own
they
exist
that
is
why
i
am
rather
glad
you
are
going
i
am
glad
too
i
said
and
i
held
out
my
hand
in
parting
i
should
not
like
to
stay
where
my
presence
caused
a
moment
uneasiness
or
discomfort
that
not
putting
it
quite
fairly
he
answered
taking
my
offered
hand
and
holding
it
loosely
in
his
own
but
you
are
an
avowed
psychist
and
in
this
way
you
are
a
little
i
should
not
like
to
offend
you
you
could
not
if
you
tried
i
said
quickly
that
means
i
am
too
insignificant
in
your
mind
to
cause
offence
he
observed
i
daresay
i
am
i
live
on
the
material
plane
and
am
content
to
remain
there
you
are
essaying
very
high
flights
and
ascending
among
difficulties
of
thought
and
action
which
are
entirely
beyond
the
useful
and
necessary
routine
of
life
and
in
the
end
these
things
may
prove
too
much
for
you
here
he
dropped
my
hand
you
bring
with
you
a
certain
atmosphere
which
is
too
rarefied
for
ordinary
mortals
it
has
the
same
effect
as
the
air
of
a
very
high
mountain
on
a
weak
heart
it
is
too
strong
one
loses
breath
and
the
power
to
think
coherently
you
produce
this
result
on
miss
harland
and
also
to
some
extent
on
me
even
slightly
on
harland
and
poor
swinton
alone
does
not
fall
under
the
spell
having
no
actual
brain
to
impress
you
need
someone
who
is
accustomed
to
live
in
the
same
atmosphere
as
yourself
to
match
you
in
your
impressions
and
opinions
we
are
on
a
different
range
of
thought
and
feeling
and
experience
and
you
must
find
us
almost
beyond
endurance
as
you
find
me
i
interposed
smiling
i
will
not
say
that
no
for
there
seems
to
have
been
a
time
when
we
were
all
on
the
same
plane
he
paused
and
there
was
a
moment
tense
silence
the
little
silvery
chime
of
a
clock
in
the
saloon
struck
twelve
dr
brayle
i
said
he
lifted
his
brooding
eyes
and
looked
at
me
if
i
have
annoyed
you
by
my
scepticism
in
certain
matters
you
must
make
allowances
for
temperament
and
pardon
me
i
should
be
sorry
if
you
bore
me
any
what
a
curious
note
of
appeal
there
was
in
his
voice
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
asking
me
to
forgive
him
for
that
murder
which
i
had
seen
reflected
in
a
vision
and
my
blood
grew
suddenly
heated
with
an
involuntary
wave
of
deep
resentment
brayle
i
said
pray
do
not
trouble
yourself
to
think
any
more
about
me
our
ways
will
always
be
apart
and
we
shall
probably
never
see
each
other
again
it
really
does
not
matter
to
you
in
the
least
what
my
feeling
may
be
with
regard
to
you
it
can
have
no
influence
on
either
your
present
or
your
future
friendships
can
not
be
commanded
you
will
not
say
he
interrupted
me
that
you
have
no
dislike
of
me
i
hesitated
then
spoke
frankly
i
will
not
i
answered
because
i
can
not
for
one
instant
our
eyes
met
then
came
something
between
us
that
suggested
an
absolute
and
irretrievable
loss
not
yet
he
murmured
not
yet
and
with
a
forced
smile
he
bowed
and
allowed
me
to
pass
to
my
cabin
i
was
glad
to
be
there
glad
to
be
alone
and
overwhelmed
as
i
was
by
the
consciousness
that
the
memories
of
my
soul
had
been
too
strong
for
me
to
resist
i
was
thankful
that
i
had
had
the
courage
to
express
my
invincible
opposition
to
one
who
had
as
i
seemed
instinctively
to
realise
been
guilty
of
an
unrepented
crime
that
night
i
slept
dreamlessly
and
the
next
morning
before
seven
i
had
left
the
luxurious
for
the
ordinary
passenger
steamer
plying
from
portree
to
glasgow
harland
kept
his
promise
of
seeing
me
off
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
i
was
very
foolish
to
travel
with
a
crowd
of
tourists
and
other
folk
when
i
might
have
had
the
comfort
and
quiet
of
his
yacht
all
the
way
but
he
could
not
move
me
from
my
resolve
though
in
a
certain
sense
i
was
sorry
to
say
to
him
you
must
write
to
us
as
soon
as
you
get
home
he
said
at
parting
a
letter
will
find
us
this
week
at
gairloch
i
shall
cruise
about
a
bit
longer
i
made
no
reply
for
the
moment
he
had
no
idea
that
i
was
not
going
home
at
all
nor
did
i
intend
to
tell
him
you
shall
hear
from
me
as
soon
as
possible
i
said
at
last
evasively
i
shall
be
very
busy
for
a
time
he
laughed
oh
i
know
you
are
always
busy
will
you
ever
get
tired
i
wonder
i
smiled
i
hope
not
with
that
we
shook
hands
and
parted
and
within
the
next
twenty
minutes
the
steamer
had
started
bearing
me
far
away
from
the
isle
of
skye
that
beautiful
weird
and
mystic
region
full
of
strange
legends
and
memories
which
to
me
had
proved
a
veritable
wonderland
i
watched
the
at
anchor
in
the
bay
of
portree
till
i
could
see
her
no
more
and
it
was
getting
on
towards
noon
when
i
suddenly
noticed
the
people
on
board
the
steamer
making
a
rush
to
one
side
of
the
deck
to
look
at
something
that
was
evidently
both
startling
and
attractive
i
followed
the
crowd
and
my
heart
gave
a
quick
throb
of
delight
when
i
saw
poised
on
the
sparkling
waters
the
fairylike
her
sails
white
as
the
wings
of
a
swan
and
her
cordage
gleaming
like
woven
gold
in
the
brilliant
sunshine
she
was
a
thing
of
perfect
beauty
as
she
seemed
to
glide
on
the
very
edge
of
the
horizon
like
a
vision
between
sky
and
sea
and
as
i
pressed
forward
among
the
thronging
passengers
to
look
at
her
she
dipped
her
flag
in
salutation
a
salutation
i
knew
was
meant
for
me
alone
when
the
flag
ran
up
again
to
its
former
position
murmurs
of
admiration
came
from
several
people
around
me
the
finest
schooner
afloat
i
heard
one
man
remark
they
say
she
goes
by
electricity
as
well
as
sailing
power
she
often
seen
about
here
said
another
she
belongs
to
a
foreigner
some
prince
or
other
named
santoris
and
i
watched
and
waited
with
unconscious
tears
in
my
eyes
till
the
exquisite
fairy
vessel
disappeared
suddenly
as
though
it
had
become
absorbed
and
melted
into
the
sun
then
all
at
once
i
thought
of
the
words
spoken
by
the
wild
highland
who
had
given
me
the
token
of
the
one
way
in
and
another
way
out
one
road
to
the
west
and
the
other
to
the
east
and
round
about
to
the
the
where
would
it
be
i
could
only
think
and
wonder
hope
and
pray
as
the
waves
spread
their
silver
foaming
distance
between
me
and
the
vanished
xiii
the
house
of
aselzion
it
is
not
necessary
to
enter
into
particular
details
of
the
journey
i
now
entered
upon
and
completed
during
the
ensuing
week
my
destination
was
a
remote
and
mountainous
corner
of
the
biscayan
coast
situated
a
little
more
than
three
days
distance
from
paris
i
went
alone
knowing
that
this
was
imperative
and
arrived
without
any
untoward
adventure
scarcely
fatigued
though
i
had
travelled
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
it
was
only
at
the
end
of
my
journey
that
i
found
myself
confronted
by
any
difficulty
and
then
i
had
to
realise
that
though
the
as
it
was
called
was
perfectly
well
known
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
district
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
show
me
the
nearest
way
there
or
even
to
let
me
have
the
accommodation
of
a
vehicle
to
take
me
up
the
steep
ascent
which
led
to
it
the
chateau
itself
could
be
seen
from
all
parts
of
the
village
especially
from
the
seashore
over
which
it
hung
like
a
toppling
crown
of
the
rock
on
which
it
was
erected
it
is
a
monastery
said
a
man
of
whom
i
asked
the
way
speaking
in
a
curious
kind
of
guttural
patois
half
french
and
half
spanish
no
woman
goes
there
i
explained
that
i
was
entrusted
with
an
important
message
he
shook
his
head
not
for
any
money
would
i
take
you
he
declared
i
should
be
afraid
for
myself
nothing
could
move
him
from
his
resolve
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
my
small
luggage
at
the
inn
and
walk
up
the
steep
road
which
i
could
see
winding
like
a
width
of
white
ribbon
towards
the
goal
of
my
desires
a
group
of
idle
peasants
watched
me
curiously
as
i
spoke
to
the
landlady
and
asked
her
to
take
care
of
my
few
belongings
till
i
either
sent
for
them
or
returned
to
fetch
them
to
which
arrangement
she
readily
consented
she
was
a
buxom
pleasant
little
frenchwoman
and
inclined
to
be
friendly
i
assure
you
mademoiselle
you
will
return
immediately
she
said
with
a
bright
smile
the
chateau
is
a
place
where
no
woman
is
ever
seen
and
a
lady
alone
ah
mon
dieu
impossible
there
are
terrible
things
done
there
so
they
say
it
is
a
house
of
mystery
in
the
daytime
it
looks
as
it
does
now
dark
as
though
it
were
a
prison
but
sometimes
at
night
one
sees
it
lit
up
as
though
it
were
on
fire
every
window
full
of
something
that
shines
like
the
sun
it
is
a
brotherhood
that
lives
there
not
of
the
church
ah
no
heaven
forbid
but
they
are
rich
and
powerful
men
and
it
is
said
they
study
some
strange
science
our
traders
serve
them
only
at
the
outer
gates
and
never
go
beyond
and
in
the
midnight
one
hears
the
organ
playing
in
their
chapel
and
there
is
a
sound
of
singing
on
the
very
waves
of
the
sea
i
beg
of
you
mademoiselle
think
well
of
what
you
do
before
you
go
to
such
a
place
for
they
will
send
you
away
i
am
sure
they
will
send
you
away
i
smiled
and
thanked
her
for
her
warning
i
have
a
message
to
give
to
the
master
of
the
brotherhood
i
said
if
i
am
not
allowed
to
deliver
it
and
the
gate
is
shut
in
my
face
i
can
only
come
back
again
but
i
must
do
my
best
to
gain
an
entrance
if
possible
and
with
these
words
i
turned
away
and
commenced
my
solitary
walk
i
had
arrived
in
the
early
afternoon
and
the
sun
was
still
high
in
the
heavens
the
heat
was
intense
and
the
air
was
absolutely
still
as
i
climbed
higher
and
higher
the
murmuring
noises
of
human
life
in
the
little
village
i
had
left
behind
me
grew
less
and
less
and
presently
sank
altogether
out
of
hearing
and
i
became
gradually
aware
of
the
great
and
solemn
solitude
that
everywhere
encompassed
me
no
stray
sheep
browsed
on
the
burnt
brown
grass
of
the
rocky
height
i
was
slowly
ascending
no
bird
soared
through
the
dazzling
deep
blue
of
the
vacant
sky
the
only
sound
i
could
hear
was
the
soft
rhythmic
plash
of
small
waves
on
the
beach
below
and
an
indefinite
deeper
murmur
of
the
sea
breaking
through
a
cave
in
the
far
distance
there
was
something
very
grand
in
the
silence
and
loneliness
of
the
scene
and
something
very
pitiful
too
so
i
thought
about
my
own
self
toiling
up
the
rocky
path
in
mingled
hope
and
fear
towards
that
grim
pile
of
dark
stone
towers
and
high
forbidding
walls
where
it
was
just
possible
i
might
meet
with
but
a
discouraging
reception
yet
with
the
letter
from
him
who
signed
himself
lover
lying
against
my
heart
i
felt
i
had
a
talisman
to
open
doors
even
more
closely
barred
nevertheless
my
courage
gave
way
a
little
when
i
at
last
stood
before
the
heavy
iron
gates
set
in
a
lofty
archway
of
stone
through
which
i
could
see
nothing
but
cavernous
blackness
the
road
i
had
followed
ended
in
a
broad
circular
sweep
opposite
this
archway
and
a
few
tall
pines
twisted
and
gnarled
in
bough
and
stem
as
though
the
full
force
of
many
storm
winds
had
battered
and
bent
them
out
of
their
natural
shapes
were
the
only
relief
to
the
barrenness
of
the
ground
an
iron
chain
with
a
massive
ring
at
the
end
suggested
itself
as
the
possible
means
of
pulling
a
bell
or
otherwise
attracting
attention
but
for
some
minutes
i
had
not
the
boldness
to
handle
it
i
stood
gazing
at
the
frowning
portal
with
a
sense
of
utter
loneliness
and
desolation
the
quick
resistless
impulse
that
had
fired
me
to
make
the
journey
and
which
as
it
were
had
driven
me
along
by
its
own
impetus
suddenly
died
away
into
a
dreary
consciousness
of
inadequateness
and
folly
on
my
own
part
and
i
began
to
reproach
myself
for
yielding
so
utterly
to
the
casual
influence
of
one
who
after
all
must
in
a
reasonable
way
be
considered
a
stranger
for
what
was
rafel
santoris
to
me
merely
an
old
college
friend
of
the
man
who
for
a
fortnight
had
been
my
host
and
with
whom
he
chanced
to
renew
acquaintanceship
during
a
yachting
tour
anything
more
simple
and
utterly
commonplace
never
occurred
yet
here
was
i
full
of
strange
impressions
and
visions
which
were
possibly
only
the
result
of
clever
hypnotism
practised
on
me
because
the
hypnotist
had
possibly
discovered
in
my
temperament
some
suitable
matter
for
an
essay
of
his
skill
and
i
had
so
readily
succumbed
to
his
influence
as
to
make
a
journey
of
hundreds
of
miles
to
a
place
i
had
never
heard
of
before
on
the
chance
of
seeing
a
man
of
whom
i
knew
nothing
except
that
according
to
what
rafel
santoris
had
said
of
him
he
was
the
follower
of
a
great
psychic
teacher
whom
once
i
had
known
such
doubtful
and
darkening
thoughts
as
these
chasing
one
another
rapidly
through
my
brain
made
me
severely
accuse
myself
of
rash
and
unpardonable
folly
in
all
i
had
done
or
was
doing
and
i
was
almost
on
the
point
of
turning
away
and
retracing
my
steps
when
a
sudden
ray
of
light
not
of
the
sun
struck
itself
sharply
as
it
were
before
my
eyes
and
hurt
them
with
its
blinding
glitter
it
was
like
a
whip
of
fire
lashing
my
hesitating
mind
and
it
startled
me
into
instant
action
without
pausing
further
to
think
what
i
was
about
i
went
straight
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
chateau
and
pulled
at
the
iron
chain
the
gates
swung
open
at
once
and
swiftly
without
sound
and
i
stepped
into
the
dark
passage
within
whereupon
they
as
noiselessly
closed
again
behind
me
there
was
no
going
back
now
and
nerving
myself
to
resolution
i
walked
quickly
on
through
what
was
evidently
a
long
corridor
with
a
lofty
arched
roof
of
massive
stone
it
was
dark
and
cool
and
refreshing
after
the
great
heat
outside
and
i
saw
a
faint
light
at
the
end
towards
which
i
made
my
way
the
light
widened
as
i
drew
near
and
an
exclamation
of
relief
and
pleasure
escaped
me
as
i
suddenly
found
myself
in
a
picturesque
quadrangle
divided
into
fair
green
lawns
and
parterres
of
flowers
straight
opposite
me
as
i
approached
a
richly
carved
double
oaken
door
stood
wide
open
enabling
me
to
look
into
a
vast
circular
domed
hall
in
the
centre
of
which
a
fountain
sent
up
tall
silver
columns
of
spray
which
fell
again
with
a
tinkling
musical
splash
into
a
sunken
pool
bordered
with
white
marble
where
delicate
pale
blue
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
enchanted
by
this
glimpse
of
loveliness
i
went
straight
on
and
entered
without
seeking
the
right
of
admission
and
then
stood
looking
about
me
in
wonder
and
admiration
if
this
was
the
house
of
aselzion
where
such
difficult
lessons
had
to
be
learned
and
such
trying
ordeals
had
to
be
faced
it
certainly
did
not
seem
like
a
house
of
penance
and
mortification
but
rather
of
luxury
exquisite
white
marble
statues
were
set
around
the
hall
in
various
niches
between
masses
of
roses
and
other
blossoms
many
of
them
perfect
copies
of
the
classic
models
and
all
expressing
either
strength
and
resolution
or
beauty
and
repose
and
most
wonderful
of
all
was
the
light
that
poured
in
from
the
high
dome
i
could
have
said
with
truth
that
it
was
like
that
which
never
was
on
sea
or
land
it
was
not
the
light
of
the
sun
but
something
more
softened
and
more
intense
and
was
totally
indescribable
fascinated
by
the
restful
charm
of
my
surroundings
i
seated
myself
on
a
marble
bench
near
the
fountain
and
watched
the
sparkle
of
the
water
as
it
rose
in
rainbow
radiance
and
fell
again
into
the
darker
shadows
of
the
pool
and
i
had
for
a
moment
lost
myself
in
a
kind
of
waking
dream
so
that
i
started
with
a
shock
of
something
like
terror
when
i
suddenly
perceived
a
figure
approaching
me
that
of
a
man
clothed
in
white
garments
fashioned
somewhat
after
the
monastic
type
yet
hardly
to
be
called
a
monk
dress
though
he
wore
a
sort
of
hood
or
cowl
pulled
partially
over
his
face
my
heart
almost
stopped
beating
and
i
could
scarcely
breathe
for
nervous
fear
as
he
came
towards
me
with
an
absolutely
noiseless
tread
he
appeared
to
be
young
and
his
eyes
dark
and
luminous
looked
at
me
kindly
and
as
i
fancied
with
a
touch
of
pity
you
are
seeking
the
master
he
enquired
in
a
gentle
voice
he
has
instructed
me
to
receive
you
and
when
you
have
rested
for
an
hour
to
take
you
to
his
presence
i
had
risen
as
he
spoke
and
his
quiet
manner
helped
me
to
recover
myself
a
little
i
am
not
tired
i
answered
i
could
go
to
him
at
once
he
smiled
that
is
not
possible
he
said
he
is
not
ready
if
you
will
come
to
the
apartment
allotted
to
you
i
am
sure
you
will
be
glad
of
some
repose
may
i
ask
you
to
follow
me
he
was
perfectly
courteous
in
demeanour
and
yet
there
was
a
certain
impressive
authority
about
him
which
silently
impelled
obedience
i
had
nothing
further
to
demand
or
to
suggest
and
i
followed
him
at
once
he
preceded
me
out
of
the
domed
hall
into
a
long
stone
passage
where
every
sign
of
luxury
beauty
or
comfort
disappeared
in
cold
vastness
and
where
at
every
few
steps
large
white
boards
with
the
word
printed
upon
them
in
prominent
black
letters
confronted
the
eyes
the
way
we
had
to
go
seemed
long
and
dreary
and
but
presently
we
turned
towards
an
opening
where
the
sun
shone
through
and
my
guide
ascended
a
steep
flight
of
stone
stairs
at
the
top
of
which
was
a
massive
door
of
oak
heavily
clamped
with
iron
taking
a
key
from
his
girdle
he
unlocked
this
door
and
throwing
it
open
signed
to
me
to
pass
in
i
did
so
and
found
myself
in
a
plain
room
with
a
vaulted
roof
and
one
very
large
lofty
uncurtained
window
which
looked
out
upon
the
sea
and
sheer
down
the
perpendicular
face
of
the
rock
on
which
the
chateau
was
built
the
furniture
consisted
of
one
small
camp
bedstead
a
table
and
two
easy
chairs
a
piece
of
rough
matting
on
the
floor
near
the
bed
and
a
hanging
cupboard
for
clothes
a
bathroom
adjoined
this
apartment
but
beyond
this
there
was
nothing
of
modern
comfort
and
certainly
no
touch
of
luxury
i
moved
instinctively
to
the
window
to
look
out
at
the
sea
and
then
turned
to
thank
my
guide
for
his
escort
but
he
had
gone
thrilled
with
a
sudden
alarm
i
ran
to
the
door
it
was
locked
i
was
a
prisoner
i
stood
breathless
and
amazed
then
a
wave
of
mingled
indignation
and
terror
swept
over
me
how
dared
these
people
restrain
my
liberty
i
looked
everywhere
round
the
room
for
a
bell
or
some
means
of
communication
by
which
i
could
let
them
know
my
mind
but
there
was
nothing
to
help
me
i
went
to
the
window
again
and
finding
it
was
like
a
french
casement
merely
latched
in
the
centre
i
quickly
unfastened
and
threw
it
open
the
scent
of
the
sea
rushed
at
me
with
a
delicious
freshness
reminding
me
of
loch
scavaig
and
the
and
i
leaned
out
looking
longingly
over
the
wide
expanse
of
glittering
water
just
now
broken
into
little
crests
of
foam
by
a
rising
breeze
then
i
saw
that
my
room
was
a
kind
of
turret
chamber
projecting
itself
sheer
over
a
great
wall
of
rock
which
evidently
had
its
base
in
the
bed
of
the
ocean
there
was
no
escape
for
me
that
way
even
if
i
had
sought
it
i
drew
back
from
the
window
and
paced
round
and
round
my
room
like
a
trapped
animal
angry
with
myself
for
having
ventured
into
such
a
place
and
forgetting
entirely
my
previous
determination
to
go
through
all
that
might
happen
to
me
with
patience
and
unflinching
nerve
presently
i
sat
down
on
my
narrow
camp
bed
and
tried
to
calm
myself
after
all
what
was
the
use
of
my
anger
or
excitement
i
had
come
to
the
house
of
aselzion
of
my
own
wish
and
will
and
so
far
i
had
endured
nothing
difficult
apparently
aselzion
was
willing
to
receive
me
in
his
own
good
time
and
i
had
only
to
wait
the
course
of
events
gradually
my
blood
cooled
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
found
myself
smiling
at
my
own
absurdly
useless
indignation
true
i
was
locked
up
in
my
own
room
like
a
naughty
child
but
did
it
matter
so
very
much
i
assured
myself
it
did
not
matter
at
all
and
as
i
accustomed
my
mind
to
this
conviction
i
became
perfectly
composed
and
quite
at
home
in
my
strange
surroundings
i
took
off
my
hat
and
cloak
and
put
them
by
then
i
went
into
the
bathroom
and
refreshed
my
face
with
delicious
splashes
of
cold
water
the
bathroom
possessed
a
mirror
fitted
into
the
wall
a
fact
which
rather
amused
me
as
i
felt
it
must
have
been
there
always
and
could
not
have
been
put
up
specially
for
me
so
that
it
would
seem
these
mystic
were
not
without
some
personal
vanity
i
surveyed
myself
in
it
with
surprise
as
i
took
down
my
hair
and
twisted
it
up
again
more
tidily
for
i
had
expected
to
look
fagged
and
tired
whereas
my
face
presented
a
smiling
freshness
which
was
unexpected
and
astonishing
to
myself
the
plain
black
dress
i
wore
was
dusty
with
travel
and
i
shook
it
as
free
as
i
could
from
railway
grimness
feeling
that
it
was
scarcely
the
attire
i
should
have
chosen
for
an
audience
of
aselzion
however
i
said
to
myself
if
he
has
me
locked
up
like
this
and
gives
me
no
chance
of
sending
for
my
luggage
at
the
inn
i
can
only
submit
and
make
the
best
of
it
and
returning
from
the
bathroom
to
the
bedroom
i
again
looked
out
of
my
lofty
window
across
the
sea
as
i
did
so
leaning
a
little
over
the
ledge
something
soft
and
velvety
touched
my
hand
it
was
a
red
rose
clambering
up
the
turret
just
within
my
reach
its
opening
petals
lifted
themselves
towards
me
like
sweet
lips
turned
up
for
kisses
and
i
was
for
a
moment
startled
for
i
could
have
sworn
that
no
rose
of
any
kind
was
there
when
i
first
looked
out
rose
from
all
the
roses
in
heaven
where
had
i
heard
those
words
and
what
did
they
signify
then
i
remembered
carefully
and
with
extreme
tenderness
i
bent
over
that
beautiful
appealing
flower
i
will
not
gather
you
i
whispered
following
the
drift
of
my
own
dreaming
fancy
if
you
are
a
message
and
i
think
you
are
i
stay
there
as
long
as
you
can
and
talk
to
me
i
shall
understand
and
so
for
a
while
we
made
silent
friends
with
each
other
till
i
might
have
said
with
the
poet
soul
of
the
rose
went
into
my
blood
at
any
rate
something
keen
fine
and
subtle
stole
over
my
senses
moving
me
to
an
intense
delight
in
merely
being
alive
i
forgot
that
i
was
in
a
strange
place
among
strange
men
i
forgot
that
i
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
prisoner
i
forgot
everything
except
that
i
lived
and
that
life
was
ecstasy
i
had
no
very
exact
idea
of
the
time
my
watch
had
stopped
but
the
afternoon
light
was
deepening
and
long
lines
of
soft
amber
and
crimson
in
the
sky
were
beginning
to
spread
a
radiant
path
for
the
descent
of
the
sun
while
i
still
remained
at
the
window
i
suddenly
heard
the
rise
and
swell
of
deep
organ
music
solemn
and
sonorous
it
was
as
though
the
waves
of
the
sea
had
set
themselves
to
song
some
instinct
then
told
me
there
was
someone
in
the
room
and
i
turned
round
quickly
to
find
my
former
guide
in
the
white
garments
standing
silently
behind
me
waiting
i
had
intended
to
complain
at
once
of
the
way
in
which
i
had
been
imprisoned
as
though
i
were
a
criminal
but
at
sight
of
his
grave
composed
figure
i
lost
all
my
hardihood
and
could
say
nothing
i
merely
stood
still
attendant
on
his
pleasure
his
dark
eyes
gleaming
from
under
his
white
cowl
looked
at
me
with
a
searching
enquiry
as
though
he
expected
me
to
speak
but
as
i
continued
to
keep
silence
he
smiled
you
are
very
patient
he
said
quietly
and
that
is
well
the
master
awaits
you
a
tremor
ran
through
me
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
violently
i
was
to
have
my
wilful
desires
granted
then
i
was
actually
to
see
and
speak
with
the
man
to
whom
rafel
santoris
owed
his
prolonged
youth
and
power
and
under
whose
training
he
had
passed
through
an
ordeal
which
had
taught
him
some
of
the
deepest
mysteries
of
life
the
result
of
my
own
wishes
seemed
now
so
terrifying
to
me
that
i
could
not
have
uttered
a
word
had
i
tried
i
followed
my
escort
in
absolute
silence
once
in
my
nervous
agitation
i
slipped
on
the
stone
staircase
and
nearly
fell
he
at
once
caught
me
by
the
hand
and
supported
me
and
the
kindness
and
gentle
strength
of
his
touch
renewed
my
courage
his
wonderful
eyes
looked
steadily
into
mine
do
not
be
afraid
he
said
in
a
low
tone
there
is
really
nothing
to
fear
we
passed
the
domed
hall
and
its
sparkling
fountain
and
in
two
or
three
minutes
came
to
a
deep
archway
veiled
by
a
portiere
of
some
rich
stuff
woven
in
russet
brown
and
gold
this
curtain
my
guide
threw
back
noiselessly
showing
a
closed
door
here
he
came
to
a
standstill
and
waited
i
waited
with
him
trying
to
be
calm
though
my
mind
was
in
a
perfect
tumult
of
expectation
mingled
with
doubt
and
dread
that
closed
door
seemed
to
me
to
conceal
some
marvellous
secret
with
which
my
whole
future
life
and
destiny
were
likely
to
be
involved
suddenly
it
opened
i
saw
a
beautiful
octagonal
room
richly
furnished
with
the
walls
lined
so
it
appeared
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
books
one
or
two
great
stands
and
vases
of
flowers
made
flashes
of
colour
among
the
shadows
and
a
quick
upward
glance
showed
me
that
the
ceiling
was
painted
in
fresco
then
my
guide
signed
to
me
to
enter
the
master
will
be
with
you
in
a
moment
he
said
please
sit
down
here
he
gave
me
an
encouraging
smile
you
are
a
little
nervous
try
and
compose
yourself
you
need
not
be
at
all
anxious
or
frightened
i
tried
to
smile
in
response
but
i
felt
far
more
ready
to
weep
i
was
possessed
by
a
sudden
hopeless
and
helpless
depression
which
i
could
not
overcome
my
guide
went
away
at
once
and
the
door
closed
after
him
in
the
same
mysteriously
silent
fashion
in
which
it
had
opened
i
was
left
to
myself
and
i
sat
down
on
one
of
the
numerous
deep
easy
chairs
which
were
placed
about
the
room
trying
hard
to
force
myself
into
at
least
the
semblance
of
quietude
but
after
all
what
was
the
use
of
even
assuming
composure
when
the
man
i
had
come
to
meet
probably
had
the
power
to
gauge
the
whole
gamut
of
a
human
being
emotion
at
a
moment
notice
instinctively
i
pressed
my
hand
against
my
heart
and
felt
the
letter
my
had
given
me
surely
that
was
no
dream
i
drew
a
long
breath
like
a
sigh
and
turned
my
eyes
towards
the
window
which
was
set
in
a
sort
of
double
arch
of
stone
and
which
showed
me
a
garden
stretching
far
away
from
the
edges
of
soft
lawns
and
flower
borders
into
a
picturesque
vista
of
woodland
and
hill
a
warmth
of
rosy
light
illumined
the
fair
scene
indicating
that
the
glory
of
the
sunset
had
begun
impulsively
i
rose
to
go
and
look
out
then
stopped
checked
and
held
back
by
a
swift
compelling
awe
i
was
no
longer
alone
i
was
confronted
by
the
tall
commanding
figure
of
a
man
wearing
the
same
white
garments
as
those
of
my
guide
a
man
whose
singular
beauty
and
dignity
of
aspect
would
have
enforced
admiration
from
even
the
most
callous
and
unobservant
and
i
knew
that
i
was
truly
at
last
in
the
presence
of
aselzion
overpowered
by
this
certainty
i
could
not
speak
i
could
only
look
and
wonder
as
he
drew
near
me
his
cowl
was
thrown
back
fully
displaying
his
fine
intellectual
head
his
eyes
deep
blue
and
full
of
light
studied
my
face
with
a
keen
scrutiny
which
i
could
feel
as
though
it
were
a
searching
ray
burning
into
every
nook
and
cranny
of
my
heart
and
soul
the
blood
rushed
to
my
cheeks
in
a
warm
wave
then
suddenly
rallying
my
forces
i
returned
him
glance
for
glance
thus
we
moved
each
on
our
own
lines
of
spiritual
attraction
closer
together
till
presently
a
slight
smile
brightened
the
gravity
of
his
handsome
features
and
he
extended
both
hands
to
me
you
are
welcome
he
said
in
a
voice
that
expressed
the
most
perfect
music
of
human
speech
rash
and
undisciplined
as
you
are
you
are
welcome
timidly
i
laid
my
hands
in
his
grateful
for
the
warm
strong
clasp
he
gave
them
then
all
at
once
hardly
knowing
how
it
happened
i
sank
on
my
knees
as
before
some
saint
or
king
silently
seeking
his
blessing
there
was
a
moment
deep
stillness
and
he
laid
his
hands
on
my
bowed
head
poor
child
he
said
gently
you
have
adventured
far
for
love
and
life
it
will
be
hard
if
you
should
fail
may
all
the
powers
of
god
and
nature
help
you
this
said
he
raised
me
with
an
infinitely
courteous
kindness
and
placed
a
chair
for
me
near
a
massive
on
which
there
were
many
papers
some
neatly
tied
up
and
labelled
others
lying
about
in
apparent
confusion
and
when
we
were
both
seated
he
began
conversation
in
the
simplest
and
easiest
fashion
you
know
of
course
that
i
have
been
prepared
for
your
arrival
here
he
said
by
one
of
my
students
rafel
santoris
he
has
been
seeking
you
for
a
long
time
but
now
he
has
found
you
he
is
hardly
better
off
for
you
are
a
rebellious
child
and
unwilling
to
recognise
him
is
it
not
so
i
felt
a
little
more
courageous
now
and
answered
him
at
once
i
am
not
unwilling
to
recognise
any
true
thing
i
said
but
i
do
not
wish
to
be
deceived
or
to
deceive
myself
he
smiled
do
you
not
how
do
you
know
that
you
have
not
been
deceiving
yourself
ever
since
your
gradual
evolvement
from
subconscious
into
conscious
life
nature
has
not
deceived
you
nature
always
takes
herself
seriously
but
you
have
you
not
tried
in
various
moods
or
phases
of
existence
to
do
something
cleverer
than
nature
to
more
or
less
outwit
her
as
it
were
come
come
do
look
so
puzzled
about
it
you
have
only
done
what
all
human
beings
do
and
think
themselves
justified
in
doing
but
now
in
your
present
state
which
is
an
advancement
and
not
a
retrogression
you
have
begun
to
gain
a
little
wider
knowledge
with
a
little
deeper
humility
and
i
am
inclined
to
have
great
patience
with
you
i
raised
my
eyes
and
was
reassured
by
his
kindly
glance
now
to
begin
with
he
went
on
you
should
know
at
once
that
we
do
not
receive
women
here
it
is
against
our
rule
and
order
we
are
not
prepared
for
them
we
do
not
want
them
they
are
never
more
than
half
souls
my
heart
gave
an
indignant
bound
but
i
held
my
peace
he
looked
straight
at
me
while
with
one
hand
he
put
together
a
few
stray
papers
on
his
desk
well
why
do
you
not
give
me
the
obvious
answer
he
queried
why
do
you
not
say
that
if
women
are
half
souls
men
are
the
same
and
that
the
two
halves
must
conjoin
to
make
one
foolish
child
you
need
not
burn
with
suppressed
offence
at
what
sounds
a
slighting
description
of
your
sex
it
is
not
meant
as
such
you
are
half
souls
and
the
chief
trouble
with
you
is
that
you
seldom
have
the
sense
to
see
it
or
to
make
any
endeavour
to
form
the
perfect
and
indivisible
union
a
sacred
task
which
is
left
in
your
hands
nature
is
for
ever
working
to
bring
the
right
halves
together
man
is
for
ever
striving
to
scatter
them
apart
and
though
it
all
comes
right
at
the
last
as
it
must
there
is
no
need
for
delay
involving
either
months
or
centuries
you
women
were
meant
to
be
the
angels
of
salvation
but
instead
of
this
you
are
the
ruin
of
your
own
i
could
offer
no
contradiction
to
this
for
i
felt
it
to
be
true
as
i
have
just
said
he
went
on
this
is
no
place
for
women
the
mere
idea
that
you
should
imagine
yourself
capable
of
submitting
to
the
ordeal
of
a
student
here
is
on
the
face
of
it
incredible
only
for
rafel
sake
have
i
consented
to
see
you
and
explain
to
you
how
impossible
it
is
that
you
should
remain
i
interrupted
him
i
must
remain
i
said
firmly
do
with
me
whatever
you
like
put
me
in
a
cell
and
keep
me
a
prisoner
give
me
any
hardship
to
endure
and
i
will
endure
it
but
do
not
turn
me
away
without
teaching
me
something
of
your
peace
and
power
the
peace
and
power
which
rafel
possesses
and
which
i
too
must
possess
if
i
would
help
him
and
be
all
in
all
to
him
here
i
paused
overcome
by
my
own
emotion
aselzion
looked
full
at
me
that
is
your
desire
to
help
him
and
to
be
all
in
all
to
him
he
said
why
did
you
not
realise
this
ages
ago
and
even
now
you
have
wavered
in
the
allegiance
you
owe
to
him
you
have
doubted
him
though
all
your
inward
instincts
tell
you
that
he
is
your
soul
true
mate
and
that
your
own
heart
beats
towards
him
like
a
bird
in
a
cage
beating
against
the
bars
towards
liberty
i
was
silent
my
fate
seemed
in
a
balance
but
i
left
it
to
aselzion
who
if
his
power
meant
anything
could
read
my
thoughts
better
than
i
could
express
them
he
rose
from
his
desk
and
paced
slowly
up
and
down
absorbed
in
meditation
presently
he
stopped
abruptly
in
front
of
me
if
you
stay
here
he
said
you
must
understand
what
it
means
it
means
that
you
must
dwell
as
one
apart
in
your
own
room
entirely
alone
except
when
summoned
to
receive
instruction
your
meals
will
be
served
there
and
you
will
feel
like
a
criminal
undergoing
punishment
rather
than
enlightenment
and
you
may
speak
to
no
one
unless
spoken
to
first
moreover
he
interrupted
himself
and
beckoned
me
to
follow
him
into
another
room
adjoining
the
one
we
were
in
here
leading
me
to
a
window
he
showed
me
a
very
different
view
from
the
sunlit
landscape
and
garden
i
had
lately
looked
upon
a
dismal
square
of
rank
grass
in
which
stood
a
number
of
black
crosses
these
do
not
mark
deaths
he
said
but
failures
failures
not
in
a
worldly
sense
but
failures
in
making
of
life
the
eternal
and
creative
thing
it
is
eternal
here
and
now
as
long
as
we
shall
choose
do
you
seek
to
be
one
of
them
no
i
answered
quietly
i
shall
not
fail
he
gave
a
slight
impatient
sigh
so
they
all
said
they
whose
records
are
here
and
he
pointed
to
the
crosses
with
an
impressive
gesture
some
of
the
men
who
have
thus
left
their
mark
with
us
are
at
this
moment
among
the
world
most
brilliant
and
successful
personalities
wealthy
and
in
great
social
request
and
only
they
themselves
know
where
the
canker
lies
only
they
are
aware
of
their
own
futility
and
they
live
knowing
that
their
life
must
lead
into
other
lives
and
dreading
that
inevitable
change
which
is
bound
by
law
to
bring
them
into
whatever
position
they
have
chiefly
sought
his
voice
was
grave
and
compassionate
and
a
faint
tremor
of
fear
ran
through
me
these
were
and
are
men
he
continued
and
you
a
woman
would
boldly
attempt
the
adventures
in
which
they
failed
think
for
a
moment
how
weak
and
ignorant
and
all
unprepared
you
are
when
you
first
began
your
psychic
studies
with
a
teacher
whom
we
both
loved
and
honoured
one
whom
you
knew
by
the
name
of
heliobas
you
had
scarcely
lived
at
all
in
the
world
since
then
you
have
worked
hard
and
done
much
but
in
your
close
application
to
the
conquest
of
difficulties
you
have
missed
many
things
by
the
way
i
give
you
credit
for
patience
and
faith
these
have
accomplished
much
for
you
and
now
you
are
at
a
crucial
point
in
your
career
when
your
will
like
the
rudder
of
a
ship
trembles
in
your
hand
and
you
are
plunging
into
unknown
further
deeps
where
there
may
be
storm
and
darkness
there
is
danger
ahead
for
any
doubting
proud
or
rebellious
soul
it
is
but
fair
to
warn
you
i
am
not
afraid
i
said
in
a
low
tone
i
can
but
die
child
that
is
just
what
you
can
not
do
grasp
that
fact
firmly
at
once
and
for
ever
you
can
not
die
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
if
you
could
die
and
have
done
with
all
duties
cares
perplexities
and
struggles
altogether
the
eternal
problem
would
be
greatly
simplified
but
the
idea
of
death
is
only
one
of
a
million
human
delusions
death
is
an
impossibility
in
the
scheme
of
life
what
is
called
by
that
name
is
merely
a
shifting
and
of
imperishable
atoms
the
endless
varying
forms
of
this
shifting
and
of
atoms
is
the
secret
we
and
our
students
have
set
ourselves
to
master
and
some
of
us
have
mastered
it
sufficiently
to
control
both
the
matter
and
spirit
whereof
we
are
made
but
the
way
of
learning
is
not
an
easy
way
rafel
santoris
himself
could
have
told
you
that
he
was
all
but
overcome
in
the
trial
for
i
spare
no
one
and
if
you
persist
in
your
rash
intention
i
can
not
spare
you
simply
because
of
your
sex
i
do
not
ask
to
be
spared
i
said
gently
i
have
already
told
you
i
will
endure
anything
a
slight
smile
crossed
his
face
so
you
will
i
believe
he
answered
in
the
old
days
i
can
well
understand
your
enduring
martyrdom
i
can
see
you
facing
lions
in
the
roman
arena
as
he
thus
spoke
i
started
and
the
warm
blood
rushed
to
my
cheeks
rather
than
not
carry
out
your
own
fixed
resolve
whether
such
resolve
was
right
or
wrong
i
can
see
you
preparing
to
drown
yourself
in
the
waters
of
the
nile
rather
than
break
through
stupid
superstition
and
convention
why
do
you
look
so
amazed
am
i
touching
on
some
old
memory
come
let
us
leave
these
black
embers
of
coward
mortality
and
return
to
the
more
cheerful
room
we
the
library
together
and
he
seated
himself
again
at
his
desk
turning
towards
me
with
an
air
of
settled
and
impressive
authority
what
you
want
to
learn
and
what
every
beginner
in
the
study
of
psychic
law
generally
wants
to
learn
first
of
all
is
how
to
obtain
purely
personal
satisfaction
and
advantage
he
said
you
want
to
know
three
things
the
secret
of
life
the
secret
of
youth
the
secret
of
love
thousands
of
philosophers
and
students
have
entered
upon
the
same
research
and
one
perhaps
out
of
the
thousand
has
succeeded
where
all
the
rest
have
failed
the
story
of
faust
is
perpetually
a
thing
of
interest
because
it
treats
of
these
secrets
which
according
to
the
legend
are
only
discoverable
through
the
aid
of
the
devil
we
know
that
there
is
no
devil
and
that
everything
is
divinely
ordained
by
a
divine
intelligence
so
that
in
the
deepest
researches
which
we
are
permitted
to
make
there
is
nothing
to
fear
but
ourselves
failure
is
always
brought
about
by
the
students
not
by
the
study
in
which
they
are
engaged
the
reason
of
this
being
that
when
they
know
a
little
they
think
they
know
all
with
the
result
that
they
become
intellectually
arrogant
an
attitude
that
instantly
nullifies
all
previous
attainment
the
secret
of
life
is
a
comparatively
easy
matter
to
understand
the
secret
of
youth
a
little
more
difficult
the
secret
of
love
the
most
difficult
of
all
because
out
of
love
is
generated
both
the
perpetuity
of
life
and
of
youth
now
your
object
in
coming
here
is
down
at
the
root
of
it
absolutely
personal
i
will
not
say
selfish
because
that
sounds
hard
and
i
will
give
you
credit
for
the
true
womanly
feeling
you
have
that
being
conscious
in
your
own
soul
of
rafel
santoris
as
your
superior
and
master
as
well
as
your
lover
you
wish
to
be
worthy
of
him
if
only
in
the
steadfastness
and
heroism
of
your
character
i
will
grant
you
all
that
i
will
also
grant
that
it
is
perfectly
natural
and
therefore
right
that
you
should
wish
to
retain
youth
and
beauty
and
health
for
his
sake
and
i
would
even
urge
that
this
desire
should
be
solely
for
his
sake
but
just
now
you
are
not
quite
sure
whether
it
is
for
his
sake
you
wish
to
hold
for
yourself
the
secret
of
life
and
the
power
of
life
continuance
the
secret
of
youth
and
the
power
of
youth
continuance
and
you
most
certainly
wish
to
have
for
yourself
as
well
as
for
rafel
the
secret
of
love
and
the
power
of
love
continuance
none
of
these
secrets
can
be
disclosed
to
worldlings
by
which
term
i
mean
those
who
allow
themselves
to
be
moved
from
their
determination
and
distracted
by
a
thousand
ephemeral
matters
i
do
not
say
you
are
such
an
one
but
you
like
all
who
live
in
the
world
have
your
friends
and
acquaintances
people
who
are
ready
to
laugh
at
you
and
make
mock
of
your
highest
aims
people
whose
delight
would
be
to
block
the
way
to
your
progress
and
the
question
with
me
is
are
you
strong
enough
to
ensure
the
mental
strain
which
will
be
put
upon
you
by
ignorant
and
vulgar
opposition
and
even
positive
derision
you
may
be
you
are
enough
though
not
always
rightly
so
for
example
you
want
to
gain
knowledge
apart
from
and
independently
of
rafel
santoris
yet
you
are
an
incomplete
identity
without
him
the
women
of
your
day
all
follow
this
vicious
policy
the
desire
to
be
independent
and
apart
from
men
which
is
the
suicide
of
their
nobler
selves
none
of
them
are
complete
creatures
without
their
stronger
halves
they
are
like
deformed
birds
with
only
one
wing
and
a
straight
flight
is
impossible
to
them
he
ceased
and
i
looked
up
whether
i
agree
with
you
or
not
hardly
matters
i
said
i
admit
all
my
faults
and
am
ready
to
amend
them
but
i
want
to
learn
from
you
all
that
i
may
all
that
you
think
i
am
capable
of
learning
and
i
promise
absolute
obedience
a
slight
smile
lightened
his
eyes
and
humility
i
bent
my
head
and
humility
you
are
resolved
then
i
am
resolved
he
paused
a
moment
then
appeared
to
make
up
his
mind
so
be
it
he
said
but
on
your
own
head
be
your
own
mischance
if
any
mischance
should
happen
i
take
no
responsibility
of
your
own
will
you
have
come
here
of
your
own
will
you
elect
to
stay
here
where
there
is
no
one
of
your
own
sex
with
whom
you
can
communicate
and
of
your
own
will
you
must
accept
all
the
consequences
is
that
agreed
his
eyes
flashed
with
an
almost
supernatural
brilliancy
as
he
put
the
question
and
i
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
fear
but
i
conquered
this
and
answered
simply
it
is
agreed
he
gave
me
a
keen
glance
that
swept
me
as
it
were
from
head
to
foot
then
turning
from
me
abruptly
struck
a
handle
on
his
desk
which
set
a
loud
bell
clanging
in
some
outer
corridor
my
former
guide
entered
almost
immediately
and
aselzion
addressed
him
honorius
he
said
show
this
lady
to
her
room
she
will
follow
the
course
of
a
probationer
and
student
as
he
spoke
honorius
gave
me
a
look
of
undisguised
amazement
and
pity
the
moment
she
desires
to
leave
every
facility
for
her
departure
is
to
be
granted
to
her
as
long
as
she
remains
under
instruction
the
rule
for
her
as
you
know
is
solitude
and
silence
i
looked
at
him
and
thought
how
swiftly
his
face
had
changed
it
was
no
longer
softened
by
the
grave
benevolence
and
kindness
that
had
sustained
my
courage
a
stern
shadow
darkened
it
and
his
eyes
were
averted
i
saw
i
was
expected
to
leave
the
room
but
i
hesitated
you
will
let
me
thank
you
i
murmured
holding
out
my
hands
timidly
almost
pleadingly
he
turned
to
me
slowly
and
took
my
hands
in
his
own
poor
child
you
have
nothing
to
thank
me
for
he
said
bear
in
mind
as
one
of
your
first
lessons
in
the
difficult
way
you
are
going
that
you
have
nothing
to
thank
anyone
for
and
nothing
to
blame
anyone
for
in
the
shaping
of
your
destiny
but
yourself
go
and
may
you
conquer
your
enemy
my
enemy
i
repeated
wonderingly
yes
again
yourself
the
only
power
any
man
or
woman
has
ever
had
or
ever
will
have
to
contend
with
he
dropped
my
hands
and
i
suppose
i
must
have
expressed
some
mute
appeal
in
my
upward
glance
at
him
for
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
smile
came
on
his
lips
god
be
with
you
he
said
softly
and
then
with
a
gentle
gesture
signed
to
me
to
leave
him
i
at
once
obeyed
and
followed
the
guide
honorius
who
led
me
back
to
my
own
room
where
without
speaking
a
word
he
closed
and
locked
the
door
upon
me
as
before
to
my
surprise
i
found
my
luggage
which
i
had
left
at
the
inn
placed
ready
for
me
and
on
a
small
dresser
set
in
a
niche
of
the
wall
which
i
had
not
noticed
before
there
was
a
plate
of
fruit
and
dry
bread
with
a
glass
of
cold
water
on
going
to
look
at
this
little
refection
which
was
simply
yet
daintily
set
out
i
saw
that
the
dresser
was
really
a
small
lift
evidently
connected
with
the
domestic
offices
of
the
house
and
i
concluded
that
this
would
be
the
means
by
which
all
my
meals
would
be
served
i
did
not
waste
much
time
in
thinking
about
it
however
i
was
only
too
glad
to
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
house
of
aselzion
on
any
terras
and
the
fact
that
i
was
imprisoned
under
lock
and
key
did
not
now
trouble
me
i
unpacked
my
few
things
among
which
were
three
or
four
favourite
books
then
i
sat
down
to
my
frugal
repast
for
which
hunger
provided
a
keen
appetite
when
i
had
finished
i
took
a
chair
to
the
open
window
and
sat
there
looking
out
on
the
sea
i
saw
my
friendly
little
rose
leaning
its
crimson
head
against
the
wall
just
below
me
with
quite
a
confidential
air
and
it
gave
me
a
sense
of
companionship
otherwise
the
solitude
was
profound
the
sky
was
darkening
into
night
though
one
or
two
glowing
bars
of
deep
crimson
still
lingered
as
memories
of
the
departed
sun
and
a
pearly
radiance
to
the
eastward
showed
a
suggestion
of
the
coming
moon
i
felt
the
sense
of
deep
environing
silence
closing
me
in
like
a
wall
and
looking
back
over
my
shoulder
from
the
window
to
the
interior
of
my
room
it
seemed
full
of
drifting
shadows
dark
and
impalpable
i
remembered
i
had
no
candle
or
any
other
sort
of
light
and
this
gave
me
a
passing
uneasiness
but
only
for
a
moment
i
could
go
to
bed
i
thought
when
i
was
tired
of
watching
the
sea
at
any
rate
i
would
wait
for
the
moonrise
the
scene
i
looked
upon
was
divinely
peaceful
and
beautiful
one
that
a
painter
or
poet
would
have
revelled
in
and
i
was
content
i
was
not
conscious
of
any
fear
but
i
did
feel
myself
being
impressed
as
it
were
and
gradually
overcome
by
the
deepening
stillness
and
great
loneliness
of
my
surroundings
rule
for
her
is
solitude
and
silence
so
had
said
aselzion
and
evidently
the
rule
was
being
enforced
xiv
cross
and
star
the
moon
rose
slowly
between
two
bars
of
dark
cloud
which
gradually
whitened
into
silver
beneath
her
shining
presence
and
a
scintillating
pathway
of
reflections
began
to
spread
itself
across
the
sea
i
remained
at
the
window
feeling
an
odd
disinclination
to
turn
away
into
the
darkness
of
my
room
and
i
began
to
think
that
perhaps
it
was
rather
hard
that
i
should
be
left
all
by
myself
locked
up
in
this
way
surely
i
might
have
been
allowed
a
light
of
some
sort
then
i
at
once
reproached
myself
for
allowing
the
merest
suggestion
of
a
complaint
to
enter
my
mind
for
after
all
i
was
an
uninvited
guest
in
the
house
of
aselzion
i
was
not
wanted
and
i
remembered
the
order
that
had
been
issued
concerning
me
moment
she
desires
to
leave
every
facility
for
departure
is
to
be
granted
to
her
i
was
much
more
afraid
of
this
for
departure
than
i
was
of
my
present
solitude
and
i
determined
to
look
upon
the
whole
adventure
in
the
best
and
most
cheerful
light
if
it
was
best
i
should
be
alone
then
loneliness
was
good
if
it
was
necessary
i
should
be
in
darkness
then
darkness
was
also
agreeable
to
me
scarcely
had
i
thus
made
up
my
mind
to
these
conditions
when
my
room
was
suddenly
illumined
by
a
soft
yet
effulgent
i
started
up
in
amazement
wondering
where
it
came
from
i
could
see
no
lamps
or
electric
burners
it
was
as
if
the
walls
glowed
with
some
surface
luminance
when
my
first
surprise
had
passed
i
was
charmed
and
delighted
with
the
warm
and
comforting
brightness
around
me
it
rather
reminded
me
of
the
electric
brilliancy
on
the
sails
of
the
i
moved
away
from
the
window
leaving
it
open
as
the
night
was
very
close
and
warm
and
sat
down
at
the
table
to
read
a
little
but
after
a
few
minutes
laid
the
book
aside
to
listen
to
a
strange
whispering
music
that
floated
towards
me
apparently
from
the
sea
and
thrilled
me
to
the
soul
no
eloquent
description
could
give
any
idea
of
the
enthralling
sweetness
of
the
harmonies
that
were
more
breathed
upon
the
air
than
sounded
and
i
became
absorbed
in
following
the
rhythm
of
the
delicious
cadences
as
they
rose
and
fell
then
by
degrees
my
thoughts
wandered
away
to
rafel
santoris
where
was
he
now
in
what
peaceful
expanse
of
shining
waters
had
his
fairy
vessel
cast
anchor
i
pictured
him
in
my
brain
till
i
could
almost
see
his
face
the
broad
brow
the
fearless
tender
eyes
and
smile
and
i
could
fancy
that
i
heard
the
deep
soft
accents
of
his
voice
always
so
gentle
when
he
spoke
to
me
me
who
had
half
resented
his
influence
and
a
quick
wave
of
long
tenderness
rose
in
my
heart
my
whole
soul
ran
out
as
it
were
to
greet
him
with
outstretched
arms
i
knew
in
my
own
consciousness
that
he
was
more
than
all
the
world
to
me
and
i
said
aloud
my
beloved
i
love
you
i
love
you
to
the
silence
almost
as
if
i
thought
it
could
convey
the
words
to
him
whom
most
i
desired
to
hear
them
then
i
felt
how
foolish
and
futile
it
was
to
talk
to
the
empty
air
when
i
might
have
confessed
myself
to
the
real
lover
of
my
life
face
to
face
had
i
been
less
sceptical
less
proud
was
not
my
very
journey
to
the
house
of
aselzion
a
testimony
of
my
own
doubting
attitude
for
i
had
come
as
i
now
admitted
to
myself
first
to
make
sure
that
aselzion
really
existed
and
secondly
to
prove
to
my
own
satisfaction
that
he
was
truly
able
to
impart
the
mystical
secrets
which
rafel
seemed
to
know
i
wearied
myself
out
at
last
with
thinking
to
no
purpose
and
closing
the
window
i
undressed
and
went
to
bed
as
i
lay
down
the
light
in
my
room
was
suddenly
extinguished
and
all
was
darkness
again
except
for
the
moon
which
sent
a
clear
white
ray
straight
through
the
lattice
there
being
no
curtain
to
shut
it
out
for
some
time
i
remained
awake
on
my
hard
little
couch
looking
at
this
ray
and
steadily
refusing
to
allow
any
sense
of
fear
or
loneliness
to
gain
the
mastery
over
me
the
music
which
had
so
enchanted
me
ceased
and
everything
was
perfectly
still
and
by
and
by
my
eyes
closed
my
tired
limbs
relaxed
and
i
fell
into
a
sound
and
dreamless
sleep
when
i
awoke
it
was
full
morning
and
the
sunshine
poured
into
my
room
like
a
shower
of
gold
i
sprang
up
full
of
delight
that
the
night
had
passed
so
peacefully
and
that
nothing
strange
or
terrifying
had
occurred
though
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
have
expected
this
everything
seemed
wonderfully
fresh
and
beautiful
in
the
brightness
of
the
new
day
and
the
very
plainness
of
my
room
had
a
fascination
greater
than
any
amount
of
luxury
the
only
unusual
thing
i
noticed
was
that
the
soft
cold
water
with
which
my
bath
was
supplied
sparkled
as
though
it
were
effervescent
once
or
twice
it
seemed
to
ripple
with
a
foam
and
it
was
never
actually
still
i
watched
its
glittering
movement
for
some
minutes
before
bathing
then
feeling
certain
it
was
charged
with
some
kind
of
electricity
i
plunged
into
it
without
hesitation
and
enjoyed
to
the
utmost
the
delicious
sense
of
invigoration
it
gave
me
when
my
toilet
was
completed
and
i
had
attired
myself
in
a
simple
morning
gown
of
white
linen
as
being
more
suitable
to
the
warmth
of
the
weather
than
the
black
one
i
had
travelled
in
i
went
to
throw
open
my
window
and
let
in
all
the
freshness
of
the
and
was
surprised
to
see
a
small
low
door
open
in
the
side
of
the
turret
through
which
i
discovered
a
winding
stair
leading
downward
yielding
to
the
impulse
of
the
moment
i
descended
it
and
at
the
end
found
myself
in
an
exquisite
little
rock
garden
abutting
on
the
seashore
i
could
actually
open
a
gate
and
walk
to
the
very
edge
of
the
sea
i
was
no
longer
a
prisoner
then
i
could
run
away
if
i
chose
i
looked
about
me
and
smiled
as
i
saw
the
impossibility
of
any
escape
the
little
garden
belonged
exclusively
to
the
turret
and
on
each
side
of
it
impassable
rocks
towered
up
almost
to
the
height
of
the
chateau
itself
while
the
bit
of
shore
on
which
i
stood
was
equally
hemmed
in
by
huge
boulders
against
which
the
waves
had
dashed
for
centuries
without
making
much
visible
impression
yet
it
was
delightful
to
feel
i
was
allowed
some
liberty
and
open
air
and
i
stayed
for
some
minutes
watching
the
sea
and
revelling
in
the
warmth
of
the
southern
sun
then
i
retraced
my
steps
slowly
looking
everywhere
about
me
as
i
went
to
see
if
there
was
anyone
near
not
a
soul
was
in
sight
i
returned
to
my
room
to
find
my
bed
made
as
neatly
as
though
it
had
never
been
slept
upon
and
my
breakfast
consisting
of
a
cup
of
milk
and
some
wheaten
biscuits
set
out
upon
the
table
i
was
quite
ready
for
the
meal
and
enjoyed
it
when
i
had
finished
i
took
my
empty
cup
and
plate
and
put
them
on
the
dresser
in
the
niche
whereupon
the
dresser
was
instantly
lowered
and
very
soon
disappeared
then
i
began
to
wonder
how
i
should
employ
myself
it
was
no
use
writing
letters
though
i
had
my
own
travelling
desk
ready
for
this
purpose
i
did
not
wish
my
friends
or
acquaintances
to
know
where
i
was
and
even
if
i
had
written
to
any
of
them
it
was
hardly
likely
that
my
correspondence
would
ever
reach
them
for
i
felt
sure
the
mystic
brotherhood
of
aselzion
would
not
allow
me
to
communicate
with
the
outside
world
so
long
as
i
remained
with
them
i
sat
meditating
and
i
began
to
consider
that
several
days
passed
thus
aimlessly
would
be
difficult
to
bear
i
could
not
keep
correct
count
of
time
my
watch
having
stopped
and
there
was
no
clock
or
chime
of
any
sort
in
the
place
that
i
could
hear
the
stillness
around
me
would
have
been
oppressive
but
for
the
soft
dash
of
little
waves
breaking
on
the
beach
below
my
window
all
at
once
to
my
great
joy
the
door
of
my
room
opened
and
the
personage
called
honorius
entered
he
bent
his
head
slightly
by
way
of
salutation
and
then
said
briefly
you
are
commanded
to
follow
me
i
rose
obediently
and
stood
ready
he
looked
at
me
intently
and
with
curiosity
as
though
he
sought
to
read
my
mind
remembering
that
aselzion
had
said
i
was
not
to
speak
unless
spoken
to
i
only
returned
his
look
steadfastly
and
with
a
smile
you
are
not
unhappy
or
afraid
or
restless
he
said
slowly
that
is
well
you
are
making
a
good
beginning
and
now
whatever
you
see
or
hear
keep
silence
if
you
desire
to
speak
speak
now
but
after
we
leave
this
room
not
a
word
must
escape
your
lips
not
a
single
exclamation
your
business
is
to
listen
learn
and
obey
he
waited
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
say
something
in
reply
but
i
preferred
to
hold
my
peace
he
then
handed
me
a
folded
length
of
soft
white
material
opaque
yet
fine
and
silky
as
gossamer
cover
yourself
with
this
veil
he
said
and
do
not
raise
it
till
you
return
here
i
unfolded
it
and
threw
it
quickly
over
me
it
was
as
delicate
as
a
filmy
cloud
and
draped
me
from
head
to
foot
effectually
concealing
me
from
the
eyes
of
others
though
i
myself
could
see
through
it
perfectly
honorius
then
signed
to
me
to
follow
and
i
did
so
my
heart
beating
quickly
with
excitement
and
expectation
we
went
through
many
passages
with
intricate
turnings
that
seemed
to
have
no
outlet
it
was
like
threading
one
way
through
a
maze
till
at
last
i
found
myself
shut
within
a
small
place
with
an
opening
in
front
of
me
through
which
i
gazed
upon
a
strange
and
picturesque
scene
i
saw
the
interior
of
a
small
but
perfectly
beautiful
gothic
chapel
exquisitely
designed
and
lit
by
numerous
windows
of
stained
glass
through
which
the
sunlight
filtered
in
streams
of
radiant
colour
patterning
with
gold
crimson
and
blue
the
white
marble
flooring
below
between
every
tapering
column
that
supported
the
finely
carved
roof
were
two
rows
of
benches
one
above
the
other
and
here
sat
an
array
of
motionless
white
figures
men
in
the
garb
of
their
mysterious
order
their
faces
almost
concealed
by
their
drooping
cowls
there
was
no
altar
in
this
chapel
but
at
its
eastern
end
where
the
altar
might
have
been
was
a
dark
purple
curtain
against
which
blazed
in
brilliant
luminance
a
cross
and
star
the
rays
of
light
shed
by
this
uplifted
symbol
of
an
unwritten
creed
were
so
vivid
as
to
be
almost
blinding
and
nearly
eclipsed
the
summer
glory
of
the
sun
itself
awed
by
the
strange
and
silent
solemnity
of
my
surroundings
i
was
glad
to
be
hidden
under
the
folds
of
my
enshrouding
white
veil
though
i
realised
that
i
was
in
a
sort
of
secret
recess
made
purposely
for
the
use
of
those
who
were
summoned
to
see
all
that
went
on
in
the
chapel
without
being
seen
i
waited
full
of
eager
anticipation
and
presently
the
low
vibrating
sound
of
the
organ
trembled
on
the
air
gradually
increasing
in
volume
and
power
till
a
magnificent
rush
of
music
poured
from
it
like
a
sudden
storm
breaking
through
clouds
i
drew
a
long
breath
of
pure
ecstasy
i
could
have
knelt
and
wept
tears
of
gratitude
for
the
mere
sense
of
hearing
such
music
was
divine
the
very
idea
of
mortality
was
swallowed
up
in
it
and
destroyed
and
the
imprisoned
soul
mounted
up
to
the
highest
life
on
wings
of
light
rejoicing
when
it
ceased
as
it
did
all
too
soon
there
followed
a
profound
silence
so
profound
that
i
could
hear
the
quick
beating
of
my
own
heart
as
if
i
were
the
only
living
thing
in
the
place
i
turned
my
eyes
towards
the
dazzling
cross
and
star
with
its
ever
darting
rays
of
fiery
brilliancy
and
the
effect
of
its
perpetual
sparkle
of
lambent
fire
was
as
if
an
electric
current
were
giving
off
messages
which
no
mortal
skill
would
ever
be
able
to
decipher
or
put
into
words
but
which
found
their
way
to
one
deepest
inward
consciousness
all
at
once
there
was
a
slight
movement
among
the
rows
of
figures
hitherto
sitting
so
motionless
and
with
one
accord
they
rose
to
their
feet
as
a
figure
tall
stately
and
imposing
came
walking
slowly
across
the
chapel
and
stood
directly
in
front
of
the
flaming
symbol
holding
both
hands
outstretched
as
though
invoking
a
blessing
it
was
the
master
aselzion
aselzion
invested
with
such
dignity
and
splendour
as
i
had
never
thought
possible
to
man
he
might
have
posed
for
some
god
or
hero
his
aspect
was
one
of
absolute
power
and
calm
other
men
might
entertain
doubts
of
themselves
at
the
intention
of
their
lives
but
this
one
in
his
mere
bearing
expressed
sureness
strength
and
authority
he
wore
his
cowl
thrown
back
and
from
where
i
sat
in
my
secluded
corner
i
could
see
his
features
distinctly
and
could
watch
the
flash
of
his
fine
steadfast
eyes
as
he
turned
them
upon
his
followers
keeping
his
hands
extended
he
said
in
a
firm
clear
voice
to
the
creator
of
all
things
visible
and
invisible
let
us
offer
up
our
gratitude
and
praise
and
so
begin
this
day
and
a
responsive
murmur
of
voices
answered
him
we
praise
thee
o
divine
power
of
love
and
life
eternal
we
praise
thee
for
all
we
are
we
praise
thee
for
all
we
have
been
we
praise
thee
for
all
we
hope
to
be
amen
there
followed
a
moment
tense
silence
then
the
assembled
brethren
sat
down
in
their
places
and
aselzion
spoke
in
measured
distinct
accents
with
the
easy
and
assured
manner
of
a
practised
orator
friends
and
brethren
we
are
gathered
here
together
to
consider
in
this
moment
of
time
the
things
we
have
done
in
the
past
and
the
things
we
are
preparing
to
do
in
the
future
we
know
that
from
the
past
stretching
back
into
infinity
we
have
ourselves
made
the
present
and
according
to
divine
law
we
also
know
that
from
this
present
stretching
forward
into
infinity
we
shall
ourselves
evolve
all
that
is
yet
to
come
there
is
no
power
no
deity
no
chance
no
concurrence
of
atoms
in
what
is
simply
a
figure
of
the
universal
mathematics
nothing
can
be
under
the
eternal
law
of
compensation
nothing
need
be
for
since
everything
is
designed
to
accomplish
each
individual
spirit
ultimate
good
you
are
here
to
learn
not
only
the
secret
of
life
but
something
of
how
to
live
that
life
and
i
in
my
capacity
am
only
striving
to
teach
what
nature
has
been
showing
you
for
thousands
of
centuries
though
you
have
not
cared
to
master
her
lessons
the
science
of
is
but
nature
first
primer
a
as
it
were
with
the
alphabet
set
out
in
pictures
you
are
told
by
sagacious
professors
who
after
all
are
no
more
than
children
in
their
newly
studied
wisdom
that
human
life
was
evolved
in
the
first
instance
from
protoplasm
as
they
think
but
they
lack
the
ability
to
tell
you
how
the
protoplasm
was
itself
evolved
and
why
where
the
material
came
from
that
went
to
the
making
of
millions
of
solar
systems
and
trillions
of
living
organisms
concerning
whose
existence
we
have
no
knowledge
or
perception
some
of
them
deny
a
god
but
most
of
them
are
driven
to
confess
that
there
must
be
an
intelligence
supreme
and
omnipotent
behind
the
visible
universe
order
can
not
come
out
of
chaos
without
a
directing
mind
and
order
would
be
quickly
submerged
into
chaos
again
were
not
the
directing
mind
of
a
nature
to
sustain
its
method
and
condition
we
start
therefore
with
this
governing
intelligence
or
directing
mind
which
must
like
the
brain
of
man
be
dual
combining
the
male
and
female
attributes
since
we
see
that
it
expresses
itself
throughout
all
creation
in
dual
form
and
type
intelligence
mind
or
spirit
whichever
we
may
elect
to
call
it
is
inherently
active
and
must
find
an
outlet
for
its
powers
and
the
very
fact
of
this
necessity
produces
desire
to
perpetuate
itself
in
varied
ways
this
again
is
the
first
attribute
of
love
hence
love
is
the
foundation
of
worlds
and
the
source
of
all
living
organisms
the
dual
atoms
or
ions
of
spirit
and
matter
yielding
to
attraction
union
and
reproduction
if
we
master
this
fact
reasonably
and
thoroughly
we
shall
be
nearer
the
comprehension
of
life
he
paused
a
moment
then
advanced
a
step
or
two
and
went
on
the
flaming
symbol
behind
him
seeming
literally
to
envelop
him
in
its
beams
what
we
have
to
learn
first
of
all
is
how
these
laws
affect
us
as
individual
human
beings
and
as
separate
personalities
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
all
obscurity
of
language
in
setting
forth
the
simple
principles
which
should
guide
and
preserve
each
human
existence
and
my
explanation
shall
be
as
brief
and
plain
as
i
can
make
it
granted
that
there
is
a
divine
mind
or
governing
intelligence
behind
the
infinitude
of
vital
and
productive
atoms
which
in
their
union
and
reproduction
build
up
the
wonders
of
the
universe
we
see
and
admit
that
one
of
the
chief
results
of
the
working
of
this
divine
mind
is
man
he
is
so
we
have
been
told
image
of
god
this
expression
may
be
taken
as
a
poetic
line
in
the
scriptures
meaning
no
more
than
poetic
imagery
but
it
is
nevertheless
a
truth
man
is
a
kind
of
universe
in
himself
he
too
is
a
conglomeration
of
atoms
atoms
that
are
active
reproductive
and
desirous
of
perpetual
creativeness
behind
them
as
in
the
nature
of
the
divine
there
is
the
governing
intelligence
the
mind
the
spirit
dual
in
type
in
action
without
the
mind
to
control
it
the
constitution
of
man
is
chaos
just
as
the
universe
itself
would
be
without
the
creator
governance
what
we
have
chiefly
to
remember
is
that
just
as
the
spirit
behind
visible
nature
is
divine
and
eternal
so
is
the
spirit
behind
each
one
of
our
individual
selves
also
divine
and
eternal
it
has
been
always
it
will
be
always
and
we
move
as
distinct
personalities
through
successive
phases
of
life
each
one
under
the
influence
of
his
or
her
own
controlling
soul
to
higher
and
ever
higher
perception
and
attainment
the
great
majority
of
the
world
inhabitants
live
with
less
consciousness
of
this
spirit
than
flies
or
worms
they
build
up
religions
in
which
they
prate
of
god
and
immortality
as
children
prattle
without
the
smallest
effort
to
understand
either
and
at
the
change
which
they
call
death
they
pass
out
of
this
life
without
having
taken
the
trouble
to
discover
acknowledge
or
use
the
greatest
gift
god
has
bestowed
upon
them
but
we
we
who
are
here
to
realise
the
existence
of
the
force
which
gives
us
complete
mastery
over
the
things
of
space
and
time
and
matter
we
who
know
that
over
that
individual
moving
universe
of
atoms
called
man
it
can
hold
absolute
control
we
can
prove
for
ourselves
that
the
whole
earth
is
subject
to
the
dominance
of
the
immortal
soul
ay
and
the
very
elements
of
air
fire
and
water
for
these
are
but
the
ministers
and
servants
to
its
sovereign
authority
he
paused
again
and
after
a
minute
or
two
of
silence
went
on
this
beautiful
earth
this
sky
the
exquisite
things
of
nature
form
and
loveliness
are
all
given
to
man
not
only
for
his
material
needs
but
for
his
spiritual
growth
and
evolvement
from
the
light
of
the
sun
he
may
draw
fresh
warmth
and
colour
for
his
blood
from
the
air
new
supplies
of
life
from
the
very
trees
and
herbs
and
flowers
he
may
renew
his
strength
and
there
is
nothing
created
that
is
not
intended
to
add
in
some
measure
to
his
pleasure
and
for
if
the
foundation
of
the
universe
be
love
as
it
is
then
love
desires
to
see
its
creatures
happy
misery
has
no
place
in
the
divine
scheme
of
things
it
is
the
result
of
man
own
opposition
to
natural
law
in
natural
law
all
things
work
calmly
slowly
and
steadfastly
together
for
good
nature
silently
obeys
god
ordinance
man
on
the
contrary
questions
argues
denies
rebels
with
the
result
that
he
scatters
his
force
and
fails
in
his
highest
effort
it
is
in
his
own
power
to
renew
his
own
youth
his
own
vitality
yet
we
see
him
sink
of
his
own
accord
into
feebleness
and
decrepitude
giving
himself
up
as
it
were
to
be
devoured
by
the
disintegrating
influences
which
he
could
easily
repel
for
as
the
directing
spirit
of
god
governs
the
infinitude
of
atoms
and
which
go
to
make
up
universes
so
the
mind
of
a
man
should
govern
the
atoms
and
of
which
he
himself
is
composed
guiding
their
actions
and
renewing
them
at
pleasure
forming
them
into
suns
and
systems
of
thought
and
creative
power
and
wasting
no
particle
of
his
eternal
life
forces
he
can
be
what
he
elects
to
be
a
god
or
merely
one
of
a
mass
of
units
in
embryo
drifting
away
from
one
phase
of
existence
to
another
in
unintelligent
indifference
and
so
compelling
himself
to
pass
centuries
of
aimless
movement
before
entering
upon
any
marked
or
decisive
path
of
individual
and
separate
action
the
greater
number
prefer
to
be
nothings
in
this
way
though
they
can
not
escape
the
universal
grinding
mill
they
must
be
used
for
some
purpose
in
the
end
be
they
never
so
reluctant
therefore
we
who
study
the
latent
powers
of
man
judge
it
wiser
to
meet
and
accept
our
destiny
rather
than
fall
back
in
the
race
and
allow
destiny
to
overtake
us
and
whip
us
into
place
with
rods
of
sharp
experience
if
there
is
anyone
here
present
who
now
desires
to
speak
to
ask
a
question
or
deny
a
statement
let
him
come
forward
boldly
and
say
what
he
has
to
say
without
fear
as
he
thus
spoke
i
looking
from
my
little
hidden
recess
saw
a
movement
among
the
seated
brethren
one
of
them
rose
and
descending
from
his
place
walked
slowly
towards
aselzion
till
he
was
within
a
few
paces
of
him
then
he
paused
and
threw
back
his
cowl
showing
a
worn
handsome
face
on
which
some
great
sorrow
seemed
to
be
marked
too
strongly
to
be
ever
erased
i
do
not
wish
to
live
he
said
i
came
here
to
study
life
but
not
to
learn
how
to
keep
it
i
would
lose
it
gladly
for
the
merest
trifle
for
life
is
to
me
a
bitter
thing
a
hideous
and
inexplicable
torment
why
should
you
o
aselzion
teach
us
how
to
live
long
why
not
rather
teach
us
how
to
die
soon
aselzion
eyes
were
bent
upon
him
with
a
grave
and
tender
compassion
what
accusation
do
you
bring
against
life
he
asked
how
has
life
wronged
you
how
has
life
wronged
me
and
the
unhappy
man
threw
up
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
desperation
you
who
profess
to
read
thought
and
gauge
the
soul
can
you
ask
how
has
life
wronged
me
by
sheer
injustice
from
my
first
breath
for
i
never
asked
to
be
born
from
my
early
days
when
all
my
youthful
dreams
and
aspirations
were
checked
smothered
and
killed
by
loving
parents
loving
parents
forsooth
whose
idea
of
was
money
every
great
ambition
frustrated
every
higher
hope
slain
and
in
my
own
love
that
love
of
woman
which
is
man
chief
curse
even
she
was
false
and
worthless
as
a
spurious
coin
caring
nothing
whether
my
life
was
saved
or
ruined
it
was
ruined
of
course
but
what
matter
who
need
care
only
the
weariness
of
it
all
the
day
after
day
burden
of
time
the
longing
to
lie
down
and
hide
beneath
the
comfortable
grass
in
peace
where
no
false
friend
no
treacherous
love
no
acquaintances
glad
to
see
me
suffer
can
ever
point
their
mocking
hands
or
round
their
cruel
eyes
at
me
again
aselzion
if
the
god
you
serve
is
half
as
wicked
as
the
men
he
made
then
heaven
itself
is
hell
he
spoke
deliberately
yet
with
passion
aselzion
silently
regarded
him
the
fiery
cross
and
star
blazed
with
strange
colours
like
millions
of
jewels
and
the
deep
stillness
in
the
chapel
was
for
many
minutes
unbroken
all
at
once
as
though
impelled
by
some
irresistible
force
he
sank
on
his
knees
aselzion
as
you
are
strong
have
patience
with
the
weak
as
you
see
the
divine
pity
those
who
are
blind
as
you
stand
firm
stretch
a
hand
to
those
whose
feet
are
on
the
shifting
quicksands
and
if
death
and
oblivion
are
among
the
gifts
of
your
bestowal
withhold
them
not
from
me
for
i
would
rather
die
than
live
there
was
a
pause
then
aselzion
voice
calm
clear
and
very
gentle
vibrated
on
the
silence
there
is
no
death
he
said
you
can
not
die
there
is
no
oblivion
you
may
not
forget
there
is
but
one
way
of
life
to
live
it
another
moment
stillness
then
again
the
steady
resolute
voice
went
on
you
accuse
life
of
injustice
it
is
you
who
are
unjust
to
life
life
gave
you
those
dreams
and
aspirations
you
speak
of
it
was
in
your
power
to
realise
them
i
say
it
was
in
your
power
had
you
chosen
no
parents
no
friends
not
god
himself
can
stop
you
from
doing
what
you
will
to
do
who
frustrated
any
great
ambition
of
yours
but
yourself
who
can
slay
a
hope
but
him
in
whose
soul
it
was
born
and
that
love
of
woman
was
she
your
true
mate
or
only
a
thing
of
eyes
and
hair
and
vanity
did
your
passion
touch
her
body
only
or
did
it
reach
her
soul
did
you
seek
to
know
whether
that
soul
had
ever
wakened
within
her
or
were
you
too
well
satisfied
with
her
surface
beauty
to
care
in
all
these
things
blame
yourself
not
life
for
life
gives
you
earth
and
heaven
time
and
eternity
for
the
attainment
of
joy
joy
in
which
but
for
yourself
there
would
never
be
a
trace
of
sorrow
the
kneeling
penitent
for
such
he
now
appeared
to
be
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
i
can
not
give
you
death
continued
you
can
take
what
is
called
by
that
name
for
yourself
if
you
choose
you
can
by
your
own
action
sudden
or
premeditated
destroy
this
present
form
and
composition
of
yourself
for
just
so
long
as
it
takes
the
forces
of
nature
to
build
you
up
again
an
incredibly
brief
moment
of
time
but
you
gain
nothing
you
neither
lose
your
consciousness
nor
your
memory
ponder
this
well
before
you
pull
down
your
present
for
ingratitude
breeds
narrowness
and
your
next
habitation
might
be
smaller
and
less
fitted
for
peace
and
quiet
breathing
with
these
words
gently
spoken
he
raised
the
penitent
from
his
knees
and
signed
to
him
to
return
to
his
place
he
did
so
obediently
without
another
word
pulling
his
cowl
closely
about
him
so
that
none
of
his
might
see
his
features
another
man
then
stepped
forward
and
addressed
aselzion
master
he
said
would
it
not
be
better
to
die
than
to
grow
old
if
as
you
teach
us
there
is
no
real
death
should
there
be
any
real
decay
what
pleasure
is
there
in
life
when
the
strength
fails
and
the
pulses
slacken
when
the
warm
blood
grows
chill
and
stagnant
and
when
even
those
we
have
loved
consider
we
have
lived
too
long
i
who
speak
now
am
old
though
i
am
not
conscious
of
age
but
others
are
conscious
for
me
their
looks
their
words
imply
that
i
am
in
their
way
that
i
am
slowly
dying
like
a
lopped
tree
and
that
the
process
is
too
tedious
for
their
impatience
and
yet
i
could
be
young
my
powers
of
work
have
increased
rather
than
lessened
i
enjoy
life
more
than
those
that
have
youth
on
their
side
but
i
know
i
carry
the
burden
of
seventy
years
upon
me
and
i
say
that
surely
it
is
better
to
die
than
live
even
so
long
aselzion
standing
in
the
full
light
of
the
glittering
cross
and
star
looked
upon
him
with
a
smile
i
also
carry
the
burden
if
burden
you
must
call
it
of
seventy
years
he
said
but
years
are
nothing
to
me
they
should
be
nothing
to
you
who
asked
you
to
count
them
or
to
consider
them
in
the
world
of
wild
nature
time
is
measured
by
seasons
only
the
bird
does
not
know
how
old
it
is
the
does
not
count
its
birthdays
you
whom
i
know
to
be
a
brave
man
and
patient
student
have
lived
the
usual
life
of
men
in
the
world
you
are
wedded
to
a
woman
who
has
never
cared
to
understand
the
deeper
side
of
your
nature
and
who
is
now
far
older
than
you
though
in
actual
years
younger
you
have
children
who
look
upon
you
as
their
banker
merely
and
who
while
feigning
affection
really
wait
for
your
death
with
eagerness
in
order
to
possess
your
fortune
you
might
as
well
have
never
had
those
children
i
know
all
this
as
you
yourself
know
it
i
also
know
that
through
the
and
influence
of
who
wish
to
persuade
you
of
your
age
the
disintegrating
process
has
begun
but
this
can
be
arrested
you
yourself
can
arrest
it
the
dream
of
faust
is
no
fallacy
only
that
the
renewal
of
youth
is
not
the
work
of
magic
evil
but
of
natural
good
if
you
would
be
young
leave
the
world
as
you
have
known
it
and
begin
it
anew
leave
wife
children
friends
all
that
hang
like
fungi
upon
an
oak
rotting
its
trunk
and
sapping
its
strength
without
imparting
any
new
form
of
vitality
live
again
love
again
i
and
he
who
was
thus
spoken
to
threw
back
his
cowl
showing
a
face
wan
and
deeply
wrinkled
yet
striking
in
its
fine
intellectuality
of
feature
i
with
these
white
hairs
you
jest
with
me
aselzion
i
never
jest
replied
aselzion
i
leave
jesting
to
the
fools
who
prate
of
life
without
comprehending
its
first
beginnings
i
do
not
jest
with
you
put
me
to
the
proof
obey
my
rules
here
but
for
six
months
and
you
shall
pass
out
of
these
walls
with
every
force
in
your
body
and
spirit
renewed
in
youth
and
vitality
but
yourself
must
work
the
miracle
which
after
all
is
no
miracle
yourself
must
build
yourself
as
everyone
is
bound
to
do
who
would
make
the
fullest
living
out
of
life
if
you
hesitate
if
you
draw
back
if
you
turn
with
one
foolish
regret
or
morbid
thought
to
your
past
mistakes
in
life
which
are
past
to
her
your
wife
a
wife
in
name
but
never
in
soul
to
your
children
born
of
animal
instinct
but
not
of
spiritual
deep
love
to
those
your
who
count
up
your
years
as
though
they
were
crimes
you
check
the
work
of
and
you
stultify
the
forces
of
renewal
you
must
choose
and
the
choice
must
be
voluntary
and
deliberate
for
no
man
becomes
aged
and
effete
without
his
own
intention
and
inclination
to
that
end
and
equally
no
man
retains
or
renews
his
youth
without
a
similar
intention
and
inclination
take
two
days
to
consider
and
then
tell
me
your
mind
the
man
he
thus
addressed
hesitated
as
though
he
had
something
more
to
say
then
with
a
deep
obeisance
went
back
to
his
place
aselzion
waited
till
he
was
seated
and
after
the
brief
interval
spoke
again
if
all
of
you
here
present
are
content
with
your
rule
of
life
in
this
place
and
with
the
studies
you
are
undertaking
and
none
of
you
wish
to
leave
i
ask
for
the
usual
sign
all
the
brethren
rose
and
raised
their
arms
above
their
heads
dropping
them
slowly
again
after
a
second
pause
enough
and
aselzion
now
moved
towards
the
cross
and
star
fronting
it
fully
as
he
did
so
i
saw
to
my
astonishment
and
something
of
terror
that
the
rays
proceeding
from
the
centre
of
the
symbol
flamed
out
to
an
extraordinary
length
surrounding
his
whole
figure
and
filling
the
chapel
with
a
lurid
brilliancy
as
though
it
were
suddenly
on
fire
straight
into
the
centre
of
the
glowing
flames
he
steadily
advanced
then
at
a
certain
point
turned
again
and
faced
his
followers
but
what
an
aspect
now
was
his
the
light
about
him
seemed
to
be
part
of
his
very
body
and
garments
he
was
transfigured
into
the
semblance
of
something
and
angelic
and
i
was
overcome
with
fear
and
awe
as
i
looked
upon
him
lifting
one
hand
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
whereat
the
brethren
descended
from
their
places
and
walking
one
by
one
in
line
came
up
to
him
where
he
stood
he
spoke
and
his
voice
rang
out
like
a
silver
clarion
o
divine
light
he
exclaimed
we
are
a
part
of
thee
and
into
thee
we
desire
to
become
absorbed
from
thee
we
know
we
may
obtain
an
immortality
of
life
upon
this
gracious
earth
o
nature
beloved
mother
whose
bosom
burns
with
hidden
fires
of
strength
we
are
thy
children
born
of
thee
in
spirit
as
in
matter
in
us
thou
hast
distilled
thy
rains
and
dews
thy
snows
and
frosts
thy
sunlight
and
thy
storm
in
us
thou
hast
embodied
thy
prolific
beauty
thy
productiveness
thy
power
and
thy
advancement
towards
good
and
more
than
all
thou
hast
endowed
us
with
the
divine
passion
of
love
which
kindles
the
fire
whereof
thou
art
created
and
whereby
we
are
sustained
take
us
o
light
keep
us
o
nature
and
thou
o
god
supreme
spirit
of
love
whose
thought
is
flame
and
whose
desire
is
creation
be
thou
our
guide
supporter
and
instructor
through
all
worlds
without
end
amen
once
more
the
glorious
music
of
the
organ
surged
through
the
chapel
like
a
storm
and
i
trembling
in
every
limb
knelt
covering
my
veiled
face
closely
with
my
hands
overcome
by
the
splendour
of
the
sound
and
the
strangeness
of
the
scene
gradually
very
gradually
the
music
died
away
a
deep
silence
followed
and
when
i
lifted
my
head
the
chapel
was
empty
aselzion
and
his
disciples
had
vanished
noiselessly
as
though
they
had
never
been
present
only
the
cross
and
star
still
remained
glittering
against
its
dark
purple
background
darting
out
long
tremulous
rays
some
of
which
were
pale
violet
others
crimson
others
of
the
delicate
hues
of
the
pink
topaz
i
looked
round
then
behind
me
and
to
my
surprise
saw
that
the
door
of
my
little
recess
had
been
unlocked
and
left
open
acting
on
an
impulse
too
strong
to
resist
i
stole
softly
out
and
stepping
on
tiptoe
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
i
found
my
way
through
a
low
archway
into
the
body
of
the
chapel
and
stood
there
all
alone
my
heart
beating
loudly
with
positive
terror
yet
there
was
nothing
to
fear
no
one
was
near
me
that
i
could
see
but
i
felt
as
if
there
were
thousands
of
eyes
watching
me
from
the
roof
from
behind
the
columns
and
from
the
windows
that
shed
their
light
on
the
marble
pavement
and
the
glowing
radiance
of
the
cross
and
star
in
all
that
stillness
was
almost
terrible
the
long
bright
rays
were
like
tongues
of
fire
mutely
expressing
unutterable
things
fascinated
i
drew
nearer
and
nearer
then
paused
abruptly
checked
by
a
kind
of
vibration
under
me
as
though
the
ground
rocked
presently
however
i
gained
fresh
courage
to
go
on
and
by
degrees
was
drawn
into
a
perfect
vortex
of
light
which
rushed
upon
me
like
great
waves
on
all
sides
so
forcibly
that
i
had
hardly
any
knowledge
of
my
own
movements
like
a
creature
in
a
dream
i
moved
my
very
hands
looked
transparent
and
as
i
stretched
them
out
towards
that
marvellous
symbol
and
when
my
eyes
glanced
for
a
moment
at
the
folds
of
my
covering
veil
i
saw
that
its
white
silkiness
shone
with
a
pale
amethystine
hue
on
on
i
went
a
desperate
idea
possessing
me
to
go
as
far
as
i
could
into
that
strange
starry
centre
of
living
luminance
the
very
boldness
of
the
thought
appalled
me
even
while
i
encouraged
it
but
step
by
step
i
went
on
resolutely
till
i
suddenly
felt
myself
caught
as
it
were
in
a
wheel
of
fire
round
and
round
me
it
whirled
darting
points
of
radiance
as
sharp
as
spears
which
seemed
to
enter
my
body
and
stab
it
through
and
through
i
struggled
for
breath
and
tried
to
draw
back
impossible
i
was
tangled
up
in
a
net
of
endless
which
though
they
gave
forth
no
heat
yet
quivered
through
my
whole
being
with
searching
intensity
as
though
bent
on
probing
to
the
very
centre
of
my
soul
i
could
not
utter
a
sound
i
stood
there
dumb
immovable
and
shrouded
in
flame
too
stunned
with
the
shock
to
realise
my
own
identity
then
all
at
once
something
dark
and
cool
floated
over
me
like
the
shadow
of
a
passing
cloud
i
looked
up
and
strove
to
utter
a
cry
a
word
of
appeal
and
then
fell
to
the
ground
lost
in
complete
unconsciousness
xv
a
first
lesson
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
lay
there
lost
to
sight
and
sense
but
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
in
a
quiet
shadowy
place
like
a
kind
of
little
hermitage
with
a
window
opening
out
upon
the
sea
i
was
lying
on
a
couch
with
the
veil
i
had
worn
still
covering
me
and
as
i
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
about
me
i
saw
that
it
was
night
and
that
the
moon
was
tracing
a
silver
network
of
beams
across
the
waves
there
was
a
delicious
fragrance
on
the
air
it
came
from
a
group
of
roses
set
in
a
tall
crystal
vase
close
to
where
i
lay
then
as
i
gradually
regained
full
knowledge
of
my
own
existence
i
perceived
a
table
in
the
room
with
a
lamp
burning
upon
it
and
at
the
table
sat
no
less
a
personage
than
aselzion
himself
reading
i
was
so
amazed
at
the
sight
of
him
that
for
the
moment
i
lay
inert
afraid
to
move
for
i
was
almost
sure
i
had
incurred
his
displeasure
till
suddenly
with
the
feeling
of
a
child
seeking
pardon
for
an
offence
i
sprang
up
and
ran
to
him
throwing
myself
on
my
knees
at
his
feet
aselzion
forgive
me
i
murmured
i
have
done
wrong
i
had
no
right
to
go
so
far
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
me
smiling
and
took
me
gently
by
the
hands
who
denies
your
right
to
go
far
if
you
have
the
strength
and
courage
he
said
dear
child
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
you
are
the
maker
of
your
own
destiny
but
you
have
been
bold
though
you
are
a
mere
woman
you
have
dared
to
do
what
few
men
attempt
this
is
the
power
of
love
within
you
that
perfect
love
which
casteth
out
fear
you
risked
a
danger
which
has
not
harmed
you
you
have
come
out
of
it
unscathed
so
may
it
be
with
every
ordeal
through
which
you
may
yet
be
tried
as
by
fire
he
raised
me
from
where
i
knelt
but
i
still
held
his
hands
i
could
not
help
it
i
said
your
command
for
me
was
and
solitude
and
in
that
silence
and
solitude
i
remained
while
i
watched
you
all
and
i
heard
everything
that
was
said
this
was
your
wish
and
order
and
when
you
all
went
away
the
silence
and
solitude
would
have
been
the
same
but
for
that
cross
and
star
they
seemed
to
speak
to
call
me
to
draw
me
to
them
and
i
went
hardly
knowing
why
yet
feeling
that
i
must
go
and
then
aselzion
pressed
my
hands
gently
then
the
light
claimed
its
own
he
said
and
courage
had
its
reward
the
door
of
your
recess
in
the
chapel
was
opened
by
my
instructions
i
wished
to
see
what
you
would
do
you
have
no
conception
as
yet
of
what
you
have
done
but
that
does
not
matter
you
have
passed
one
test
successfully
for
had
you
remained
passive
in
your
place
till
someone
came
to
remove
you
i
should
have
known
you
for
a
creature
of
weak
will
and
transitory
impulses
but
you
are
stronger
than
i
thought
so
i
have
come
to
give
you
your
first
lesson
my
first
lesson
i
repeated
the
words
after
him
wonderingly
as
he
let
go
my
hands
and
put
me
gently
into
a
chair
which
i
had
not
perceived
but
which
stood
in
the
shadow
cast
by
the
lamp
almost
immediately
opposite
to
him
yes
your
first
lesson
he
answered
smiling
gravely
the
first
lesson
in
what
you
have
come
here
to
learn
the
perpetuation
of
your
life
on
earth
for
just
so
long
as
you
desire
it
the
secret
which
gives
to
rafel
santoris
his
youth
and
strength
and
power
as
well
as
his
governance
over
certain
elemental
forces
but
first
take
this
and
he
poured
out
from
a
quaintly
shaped
flask
a
full
glass
of
deep
wine
this
is
no
magic
potion
it
is
simply
a
form
of
nourishment
which
will
be
safer
for
you
than
solid
food
and
i
know
you
have
eaten
nothing
all
day
since
your
light
breakfast
drink
it
all
every
drop
i
obeyed
it
seemed
tasteless
and
strengthless
like
pure
water
now
he
continued
i
will
put
before
you
a
very
simple
illustration
of
the
truth
which
underlies
all
nature
if
you
were
taken
into
a
vast
plain
and
there
saw
two
opposing
armies
the
one
actuated
by
a
passion
for
destruction
the
other
moved
only
by
a
desire
for
good
you
would
naturally
wish
the
latter
force
to
win
would
you
not
i
answered
yes
at
once
without
hesitation
but
suppose
he
went
on
that
both
armies
were
actuated
by
good
and
that
the
object
of
the
destroying
force
was
only
to
break
down
what
was
effete
and
mischievous
in
order
to
build
it
up
again
in
stronger
and
nobler
forms
while
the
aim
of
the
other
was
to
strictly
preserve
and
maintain
the
advantages
it
possessed
which
side
would
then
have
your
sympathy
i
tried
to
think
but
could
not
instantly
determine
here
is
your
point
of
hesitation
he
said
and
here
the
usual
limit
of
human
comprehension
both
forces
are
good
but
as
a
rule
we
can
only
side
with
one
we
name
that
one
life
the
other
death
we
think
life
alone
stands
for
what
is
living
and
that
death
is
a
kind
of
cessation
of
life
instead
of
being
one
of
life
most
active
forms
the
universe
is
entirely
composed
of
these
two
fighting
forces
we
call
them
good
and
evil
but
there
is
no
is
only
a
destruction
of
what
might
be
harmful
if
allowed
to
exist
to
put
it
clearly
the
million
millions
of
atoms
and
electrons
which
compose
the
everlasting
elements
of
spirit
and
matter
are
dual
that
is
to
say
of
two
kinds
those
which
preserve
their
state
of
equilibrium
and
those
whose
work
is
to
disintegrate
in
order
to
build
up
again
as
with
the
universe
so
with
the
composition
of
a
human
being
in
you
as
in
myself
there
exist
these
two
forces
and
our
souls
are
so
to
speak
placed
on
guard
between
them
the
one
set
of
atoms
is
prepared
to
maintain
the
equilibrium
of
health
and
life
but
if
through
the
neglect
and
unwatchfulness
of
the
sentinel
soul
any
of
them
are
allowed
to
become
disused
and
effete
the
other
set
whose
business
it
is
to
disintegrate
whatever
is
faulty
and
useless
for
the
purpose
of
renewing
it
in
better
form
begins
to
work
and
this
disintegrating
process
is
our
conception
of
decay
and
death
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
such
process
can
not
even
begin
without
our
consent
and
collusion
life
can
be
retained
in
our
possession
for
an
indefinite
period
on
this
earth
but
it
can
only
be
done
through
our
own
actions
our
own
wish
and
will
i
looked
at
him
questioningly
one
may
wish
and
will
many
things
i
said
but
the
result
is
not
always
successful
is
that
your
experience
he
asked
bending
his
keen
eyes
full
upon
me
you
know
if
you
are
true
to
yourself
that
no
power
can
resist
the
insistence
of
a
strong
will
brought
steadily
to
bear
on
any
intention
if
the
effort
fails
it
is
only
because
the
will
has
hesitated
what
have
you
made
of
some
of
your
past
lives
you
and
your
lover
both
through
hesitation
at
a
supreme
moment
i
looked
at
him
appealingly
if
we
made
mistakes
could
we
altogether
help
it
i
asked
does
it
not
seem
that
we
tried
for
the
best
he
smiled
slightly
no
it
does
not
seem
so
to
me
he
replied
the
mainspring
of
your
various
previous
existences
the
law
of
attraction
drawing
you
together
was
and
is
love
this
you
fought
against
as
though
it
were
a
crime
and
in
many
cases
you
obeyed
the
temporary
conventionalities
of
man
rather
than
the
unchanging
ordinance
of
god
and
now
divided
as
you
have
been
lost
as
you
have
been
in
endless
whirlpools
of
infinitude
you
are
brought
together
again
and
though
your
lover
has
ceased
to
question
you
have
not
ceased
to
doubt
i
do
not
doubt
i
exclaimed
suddenly
and
with
passion
i
love
him
with
all
my
soul
i
will
never
lose
him
again
aselzion
looked
at
me
questioningly
how
do
you
know
you
have
not
lost
him
already
he
said
at
this
a
sudden
wave
of
despair
swept
over
me
a
chill
sense
of
emptiness
and
desolation
could
it
be
possible
that
my
own
rashness
and
selfishness
had
again
separated
me
from
my
beloved
for
so
i
now
called
him
in
my
heart
had
i
by
some
foolish
distrustful
thought
estranged
him
once
more
from
my
soul
the
rising
tears
choked
me
i
rose
from
my
seat
hardly
knowing
what
i
did
and
went
to
the
window
for
air
aselzion
followed
me
and
laid
his
hand
gently
on
my
shoulder
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
win
love
as
to
keep
it
he
said
misunderstanding
and
want
of
quick
sympathy
end
in
and
separation
and
this
is
far
worse
than
what
mortals
call
death
the
burning
tears
fell
slowly
from
my
eyes
every
word
seemed
to
pierce
my
heart
i
looked
yearningly
out
on
the
sea
rippling
under
the
moon
i
thought
of
the
day
barely
a
week
ago
when
rafel
stood
beside
me
his
hand
clasping
mine
such
a
little
division
of
time
seemed
to
have
elapsed
since
we
were
together
and
yet
how
long
at
last
i
spoke
i
would
rather
die
if
death
were
possible
than
lose
his
love
i
said
and
where
there
is
no
love
surely
there
must
be
death
aselzion
sighed
poor
child
now
you
understand
why
the
lonely
soul
hurls
itself
wildly
from
one
phase
of
existence
to
another
till
it
finds
its
true
mate
he
answered
you
say
truly
that
where
there
is
no
love
there
is
no
real
life
it
is
merely
a
existence
but
you
have
no
cause
to
grieve
not
now
not
if
you
are
firm
and
faithful
rafel
santoris
is
safe
and
well
and
his
soul
is
so
much
with
you
you
are
so
constantly
in
his
thoughts
that
it
is
as
if
he
were
himself
here
see
and
he
placed
his
two
hands
for
a
moment
over
my
eyes
and
then
removed
them
i
uttered
a
cry
of
ecstasy
for
there
before
me
on
the
moonlit
water
i
saw
the
her
sails
glittering
with
light
and
her
aerial
shape
clearly
defined
against
the
sky
oh
how
i
longed
to
fly
across
the
strip
of
water
which
alone
seemed
to
divide
us
and
once
more
to
stand
on
the
deck
beside
him
whom
i
now
loved
more
than
my
very
hopes
of
heaven
but
i
knew
it
was
only
a
vision
conjured
up
before
me
by
the
magic
of
aselzion
a
magic
used
gently
for
my
sake
to
help
and
comfort
me
in
a
moment
of
sadness
and
heart
longing
and
i
watched
knowing
that
the
picture
must
fade
as
it
slowly
did
vanishing
like
a
rainbow
in
a
swirl
of
cloud
it
is
indeed
a
i
said
smiling
faintly
as
i
turned
again
to
aselzion
i
pray
that
love
itself
may
never
be
so
fleeting
if
love
is
fleeting
it
is
not
love
he
answered
as
ephemeral
passion
called
by
that
name
is
the
ordinary
sort
of
attraction
existing
between
ordinary
men
and
women
men
who
see
no
farther
than
the
gratification
of
a
desire
and
women
who
see
no
higher
than
the
yielding
to
that
desire
men
who
love
in
the
highest
and
most
faithful
meaning
of
the
term
are
much
rarer
than
women
women
are
very
near
the
divine
in
love
when
it
is
first
awakened
in
them
if
afterwards
they
sink
to
a
lower
level
it
is
generally
the
men
who
have
dragged
them
down
unless
a
man
is
bent
on
the
highest
he
is
apt
to
settle
on
the
lowest
whereas
a
woman
generally
soars
to
the
highest
ideals
at
first
in
the
blind
instinct
of
a
soul
seeking
its
mate
how
often
she
is
hurled
back
from
the
empyrean
only
the
angels
know
not
to
all
is
given
power
to
master
and
control
the
and
it
is
this
i
would
have
you
understand
before
i
leave
you
i
can
teach
you
the
way
to
hold
your
life
safely
above
all
disintegrating
elements
but
the
learning
of
the
lesson
rests
with
yourself
he
sat
down
and
i
resumed
my
place
in
the
chair
opposite
to
him
prepared
to
hear
him
with
the
closest
attention
there
were
a
few
things
on
the
table
which
i
had
not
previously
noticed
and
one
of
these
was
a
circular
object
covered
with
a
cloth
he
removed
this
covering
and
showed
me
a
crystal
globe
which
appeared
to
be
full
of
some
strange
volatile
fluid
clear
in
itself
but
intersected
with
endless
floating
brilliant
dots
and
lines
look
well
at
this
he
said
for
here
you
have
a
very
simple
manifestation
of
a
great
truth
these
dots
and
lines
which
you
observe
perpetually
in
motion
are
an
epitome
of
what
is
going
on
in
the
composition
of
every
human
being
some
of
them
as
you
see
go
in
different
directions
yet
meet
and
mingle
with
each
other
at
various
points
of
convergence
then
again
become
separated
they
are
the
and
the
disintegrating
forces
of
the
whole
cosmos
and
mark
this
well
they
are
all
when
unimprisoned
directed
by
a
governing
you
in
your
present
state
of
existence
are
simply
an
organised
form
composed
of
these
atoms
and
your
which
is
part
of
the
divine
creative
influence
is
set
within
you
to
govern
them
if
you
govern
them
properly
the
and
revivifying
atoms
within
you
obey
your
command
and
with
increasing
strength
gradually
control
and
subdue
their
disintegrating
opponents
opponents
which
after
all
are
only
their
servants
ready
to
disencumber
them
from
all
that
is
worthless
and
useless
at
the
first
sign
of
disablement
there
is
nothing
more
simple
than
this
law
which
has
only
to
be
followed
in
order
to
preserve
both
life
and
youth
it
all
contained
in
an
effort
of
the
will
to
which
everything
in
nature
responds
just
as
a
ship
obeys
the
compass
remember
this
well
i
say
everything
in
nature
this
crystal
globe
holds
momentarily
imprisoned
atoms
which
can
not
just
now
be
directed
because
they
are
shut
in
away
from
all
will
to
govern
them
but
if
i
left
them
as
they
are
for
a
few
more
hours
their
force
would
shatter
the
crystal
and
they
would
escape
to
resume
their
appointed
way
they
are
only
shown
to
you
as
an
object
lesson
to
prove
that
such
things
are
they
are
facts
not
dreams
you
like
this
crystal
globe
are
full
of
imprisoned
atoms
atoms
of
spirit
and
matter
which
work
together
to
make
you
what
you
are
but
you
have
also
the
governing
will
which
is
meant
to
control
them
and
move
them
either
to
support
sustain
and
revivify
you
or
else
to
weaken
break
down
and
finally
disperse
and
disintegrate
you
preparatory
to
your
assumption
of
another
form
and
phase
of
existence
now
do
you
begin
to
understand
i
think
i
do
i
answered
but
is
it
possible
always
to
make
this
effort
of
the
will
there
is
no
moment
in
which
you
do
not
consciously
or
subconsciously
something
he
answered
and
the
amount
of
power
you
use
up
in
perfectly
trifling
and
ephemeral
things
could
almost
lift
a
planet
but
let
us
take
simple
actions
such
as
raising
a
hand
you
think
this
movement
instinctive
or
mechanical
but
it
is
only
because
you
will
to
raise
it
that
you
can
do
it
if
you
willed
not
to
raise
it
it
could
not
raise
itself
of
itself
this
tremendous
force
this
divine
gift
of
is
hardly
exercised
at
all
by
the
majority
of
men
and
women
hence
their
manner
of
drifting
here
and
there
their
pliable
yielding
to
this
or
that
opinion
the
easy
sway
obtained
over
the
million
by
a
few
leaders
and
reformers
the
infectious
follies
which
possess
whole
communities
at
a
time
the
caprices
of
fashion
the
moods
of
society
all
these
are
due
to
scattered
which
if
concentrated
would
indeed
the
earth
and
subdue
it
but
we
can
not
teach
the
world
and
therefore
we
must
be
content
to
teach
and
train
a
few
individuals
only
and
when
you
ask
if
it
is
possible
always
to
make
the
necessary
effort
of
will
i
answer
yes
of
course
it
is
possible
the
secret
of
it
all
is
to
resolve
upon
a
firm
attitude
and
maintain
it
if
you
encourage
thoughts
of
fear
hesitation
disease
trouble
decay
incompetency
failure
and
feebleness
you
at
once
give
an
impetus
to
the
disintegrating
forces
within
you
to
begin
their
work
and
you
gradually
become
ill
timorous
and
diseased
in
mind
and
body
if
on
the
contrary
your
thoughts
are
centred
on
health
vitality
youth
joy
love
and
creativeness
you
encourage
all
the
revivifying
elements
of
your
system
to
build
up
new
nerve
tissue
and
fresh
brain
cells
as
well
as
to
make
new
blood
no
scientist
has
ever
really
discovered
any
logical
cause
why
human
beings
should
die
they
are
apparently
intended
to
live
for
an
indefinite
period
it
is
they
themselves
who
kill
themselves
even
are
usually
the
result
of
their
own
carelessness
recklessness
or
inattention
to
warning
circumstance
i
am
trying
to
put
all
this
as
simply
as
i
can
to
you
there
are
hundreds
of
books
which
you
might
study
in
which
the
very
manner
of
expression
is
so
abstruse
and
involved
that
even
the
most
cultured
intelligence
can
scarcely
grasp
it
but
what
i
have
told
you
is
perfectly
easy
of
comprehension
the
only
difficulty
lies
in
its
practical
application
therefore
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
time
you
are
here
you
will
enter
upon
certain
tests
and
trials
of
your
and
the
result
of
these
will
prove
whether
you
are
strong
enough
to
be
successful
in
your
quest
of
life
and
youth
and
love
if
you
are
capable
of
maintaining
the
true
attitude
if
you
can
find
and
keep
the
real
of
the
divine
image
within
you
all
will
be
well
and
remember
that
if
you
once
learn
how
to
govern
and
control
the
atomic
forces
within
yourself
you
will
equally
govern
and
control
all
atomic
forces
which
come
within
your
atmosphere
this
gives
you
what
would
be
called
by
the
ignorant
power
though
it
is
no
miracle
it
is
nothing
more
than
the
attitude
of
spirit
controlling
matter
you
will
find
yourself
not
only
able
to
govern
your
own
forces
but
also
to
draw
upon
nature
for
fresh
supplies
the
air
the
sunshine
the
trees
the
flowers
will
give
you
all
they
have
to
give
on
demand
and
nothing
shall
be
refused
to
you
and
ye
shall
receive
seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
naturally
the
law
is
that
what
you
receive
you
must
give
out
again
in
an
ungrudging
outflow
of
love
and
generosity
and
beneficence
and
sympathy
not
only
towards
mankind
but
to
everything
that
lives
for
as
you
are
told
and
it
shall
be
given
unto
you
good
measure
pressed
down
and
shaken
together
and
running
over
shall
men
give
into
your
bosom
for
with
the
same
measure
that
ye
mete
withal
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
these
sayings
of
our
greatest
master
are
heard
so
often
that
they
are
considered
by
many
people
almost
trite
and
commonplace
but
they
hold
a
truth
from
which
we
can
not
escape
even
such
a
little
matter
as
a
kind
word
is
paid
back
to
the
one
who
uttered
it
with
a
double
interest
of
kindness
while
a
cruel
or
coarse
one
carries
its
own
punishment
those
who
take
without
giving
are
generally
unsuccessful
in
their
lives
and
aims
while
those
who
give
without
taking
appear
to
be
miraculously
served
by
both
fame
and
fortune
this
being
merely
the
enactment
of
the
spiritual
law
i
do
not
want
fame
or
fortune
i
said
love
is
enough
for
me
aselzion
smiled
enough
for
you
indeed
my
child
it
is
enough
for
all
if
you
have
love
you
have
entered
into
the
secret
mind
of
god
love
inspires
all
nobleness
all
endurance
all
courage
and
i
think
you
have
some
of
its
attributes
for
you
have
been
bold
in
your
first
independent
essay
and
it
is
this
very
boldness
that
has
brought
me
here
to
speak
to
you
you
have
of
your
own
accord
and
without
preparation
passed
what
we
students
and
mystics
call
first
circle
of
fire
and
you
are
therefore
ready
for
the
rest
of
your
trial
so
i
will
now
take
you
back
to
your
own
room
and
leave
you
there
for
you
must
face
your
ordeal
alone
my
heart
sank
a
little
but
i
said
nothing
and
watched
him
as
he
took
up
the
crystal
globe
full
of
the
darting
lines
and
points
of
light
gleaming
like
imprisoned
fire
and
held
it
for
a
moment
between
his
two
hands
then
he
set
it
down
again
and
covered
it
as
it
had
been
covered
before
the
next
moment
he
had
extinguished
the
lamp
and
we
stood
together
in
the
pale
brilliancy
of
the
moonlight
which
now
spread
itself
in
a
broad
path
of
silver
across
the
sea
the
tide
was
coming
in
and
i
heard
the
solemn
sound
of
rising
waves
breaking
rhythmically
upon
the
shore
in
silence
aselzion
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
through
a
low
doorway
out
of
the
little
hermitage
into
the
open
air
where
we
stood
within
a
few
feet
of
the
sea
the
moonbeams
bathed
us
in
a
shower
of
pearly
radiance
and
i
turned
instinctively
to
look
at
my
companion
his
face
appeared
transfigured
into
something
of
supernatural
beauty
and
for
one
second
the
remembrance
of
how
he
had
said
in
the
chapel
that
he
carried
the
burden
of
seventy
years
upon
him
flashed
across
me
with
a
shock
of
surprise
seventy
years
he
appeared
to
be
in
the
very
prime
and
splendour
of
life
and
the
mere
idea
of
age
as
connected
with
him
was
absurd
and
incongruous
and
while
i
gazed
upon
him
wondering
and
fascinated
he
lifted
one
hand
as
though
in
solemn
invocation
to
the
stars
that
gleamed
in
their
countless
millions
overhead
and
his
voice
deep
and
musical
rang
out
softly
yet
clearly
on
the
silence
o
supreme
guide
of
all
the
worlds
created
accept
this
soul
which
seeks
to
be
consecrated
unto
thee
help
her
to
attain
to
all
that
shall
be
for
her
wisdom
and
betterment
and
make
her
one
with
that
nature
whereof
she
is
born
thou
silent
and
peaceful
night
invest
her
with
thy
deep
tranquillity
thou
bright
moon
penetrate
her
spirit
with
the
shining
in
of
holy
dreams
give
her
of
thy
strength
and
depth
o
sea
and
may
she
draw
from
the
treasures
of
the
air
all
health
all
beauty
all
life
all
sweetness
so
that
her
existence
may
be
a
joy
to
the
world
and
her
love
a
benediction
amen
my
whole
being
thrilled
with
a
sense
of
keen
rapture
as
he
thus
prayed
for
me
i
could
have
knelt
to
him
in
reverence
but
that
i
instinctively
knew
he
would
not
wish
this
act
of
homage
i
felt
that
it
was
best
to
keep
silence
and
i
obeyed
his
guiding
touch
as
still
holding
my
hand
he
led
me
into
a
vaulted
stone
passage
and
up
a
long
winding
stair
at
the
head
of
which
he
paused
and
taking
a
key
from
his
girdle
unlocked
a
small
door
there
is
your
room
my
child
he
said
with
a
grave
kindliness
which
moved
me
strangely
farewell
the
future
is
with
yourself
alone
i
clung
to
his
hand
for
an
instant
shall
i
not
see
you
again
i
asked
with
a
little
tremor
in
my
voice
yes
you
will
see
me
again
if
you
pass
your
ordeal
successfully
he
answered
not
if
you
fail
what
will
happen
if
i
fail
nothing
but
the
most
ordinary
circumstance
he
answered
you
will
leave
this
place
in
perfect
safety
and
return
to
your
home
and
your
usual
avocations
you
will
live
as
most
women
live
perhaps
on
a
slightly
higher
grade
of
thought
and
action
and
in
time
you
will
come
to
look
upon
your
visit
to
the
house
of
aselzion
as
the
merest
wilful
escapade
of
folly
the
world
and
its
conventions
will
hold
you
never
i
exclaimed
passionately
aselzion
i
will
not
fail
he
looked
earnestly
in
my
face
then
laid
his
hands
on
my
head
in
a
mute
blessing
and
signed
to
me
to
pass
into
my
turret
room
i
obeyed
he
closed
the
door
upon
me
instantly
i
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
then
just
the
faint
echo
of
his
retreating
footsteps
down
the
winding
stair
my
room
was
illumined
by
a
very
faint
light
the
source
of
which
i
knew
not
everything
was
as
i
had
left
it
before
i
had
been
summoned
to
the
mysterious
chapel
of
the
cross
and
star
and
i
looked
about
me
tranquillised
by
the
peace
and
simplicity
of
my
surroundings
i
did
not
feel
disposed
to
sleep
and
i
resolved
to
write
down
from
memory
all
that
aselzion
had
told
me
while
it
was
fresh
in
my
mind
the
white
veil
i
had
been
given
still
clung
about
me
i
now
took
it
off
and
carefully
folded
it
ready
for
further
use
if
needed
sitting
down
at
the
little
table
i
took
out
pen
ink
and
paper
but
somehow
i
could
not
fix
my
attention
on
what
i
intended
to
do
the
silence
around
me
was
more
intense
than
ever
and
though
my
window
was
open
i
could
not
even
hear
the
murmur
of
the
sea
i
listened
hardly
drawing
breath
there
was
not
a
sound
the
extraordinary
silence
deepened
and
with
it
came
a
sense
of
cold
i
seemed
to
be
removed
into
a
place
apart
where
no
human
touch
no
human
voice
could
reach
me
and
i
felt
as
i
had
never
felt
in
all
my
life
before
that
i
was
indeed
utterly
alone
xvi
shadow
and
sound
the
stillness
deepened
it
seemed
to
myself
that
i
could
hear
the
quickened
beating
of
every
pulse
in
my
body
a
curious
vague
terror
began
to
possess
me
i
fought
against
its
insidious
influence
and
bending
my
head
down
over
the
paper
i
had
set
out
before
me
i
prepared
to
write
after
a
few
minutes
i
managed
to
gain
some
control
over
my
nerves
and
started
to
put
down
clearly
and
in
sequence
the
things
aselzion
had
told
me
though
i
knew
there
was
little
danger
of
my
ever
forgetting
them
and
then
a
sudden
sensation
came
over
me
which
forced
me
to
realise
that
something
or
someone
was
in
the
room
looking
steadfastly
at
me
with
an
effort
i
raised
my
head
and
saw
nothing
at
first
then
by
degrees
i
became
aware
that
a
shadow
dark
and
impenetrable
stood
between
me
and
the
open
window
at
first
it
seemed
simply
a
formless
mass
of
black
vapour
but
very
gradually
it
assumed
the
outline
of
a
shape
which
did
not
seem
human
i
laid
down
my
pen
and
with
my
heart
thumping
of
fear
looked
at
this
strange
darkness
gathered
as
it
were
in
one
place
and
blocking
out
the
silver
gleam
of
the
moon
as
i
looked
all
the
light
in
my
room
was
suddenly
extinguished
a
cry
rose
involuntarily
to
my
lips
and
physical
fright
began
to
gain
the
mastery
over
me
for
with
the
increasing
gloom
the
mysterious
shadow
grew
more
and
more
defined
a
blackness
standing
out
as
it
were
against
another
blackness
the
pale
glint
of
the
moonbeams
only
illumining
it
faintly
as
a
cloud
may
be
edged
with
a
suggestion
of
light
it
was
not
motionless
it
stirred
now
and
then
as
though
about
to
lift
itself
to
some
supernatural
stature
and
bend
above
me
or
swoop
down
upon
me
like
an
embodied
storm
and
as
i
still
gazed
upon
it
fearingly
every
nerve
strained
to
an
almost
unsupportable
tension
i
could
have
sworn
that
two
eyes
large
and
luminous
were
fixed
with
a
searching
pitiless
intensity
on
mine
it
is
impossible
to
describe
what
i
felt
a
sense
of
sick
swooning
horror
overcame
me
my
head
swam
giddily
and
i
could
not
now
utter
a
sound
trembling
violently
i
rose
to
my
feet
in
a
kind
of
mechanical
impulse
determined
to
turn
away
from
the
dreadful
contemplation
of
this
formless
phantom
when
suddenly
as
if
by
a
lightning
flash
of
conviction
the
thought
came
to
me
that
it
was
not
by
coward
avoidance
that
i
could
expect
to
overcome
either
my
own
fears
or
the
nameless
danger
which
apparently
threatened
me
i
closed
my
eyes
and
retreated
as
it
were
within
myself
to
find
that
of
my
own
spirit
which
i
knew
must
remain
an
invincible
force
despite
all
attack
being
in
itself
immortal
and
i
mentally
barricaded
my
soul
with
thoughts
of
armed
resistance
then
opening
my
eyes
again
i
saw
that
the
shadow
loomed
blacker
and
vaster
while
the
luminance
around
it
was
more
defined
and
was
not
the
radiance
of
the
moon
but
some
other
light
that
was
ghostly
and
terrifying
but
i
had
now
regained
a
little
courage
and
slight
as
it
was
i
held
to
it
as
my
last
hope
and
gradually
steadied
myself
upon
it
like
a
drowning
creature
clinging
to
a
plank
for
rescue
presently
i
found
myself
able
to
ask
questions
of
my
inner
consciousness
what
after
all
could
this
phantom
if
phantom
it
were
do
to
work
me
harm
could
it
kill
me
with
sheer
terror
surely
in
that
case
the
terror
would
be
my
own
fault
for
why
should
i
be
afraid
the
thing
called
death
being
no
more
than
a
living
change
did
it
matter
so
much
when
or
how
the
change
was
effected
who
is
responsible
i
said
to
myself
for
the
sense
of
fear
who
is
it
that
so
mistrusts
the
divine
order
of
the
universe
as
to
doubt
the
ultimate
intention
of
goodness
in
things
which
appear
evil
is
it
not
i
alone
who
am
the
instigator
of
my
own
dread
and
can
this
dark
dumb
spectre
do
more
to
me
than
is
ordained
for
my
blessing
in
the
end
with
these
thoughts
i
grew
bold
my
nervous
trembling
ceased
i
now
chose
deliberately
to
consider
and
willed
to
determine
that
this
mysterious
shadow
darker
still
as
it
grew
was
something
of
a
friend
in
disguise
i
lifted
my
head
half
defiantly
half
hopefully
in
the
gloom
and
the
strange
fact
that
the
only
light
i
saw
came
from
the
weirdly
gleaming
edge
of
radiance
round
the
phantom
itself
did
not
frighten
me
from
the
attitude
i
had
resolved
upon
the
more
i
settled
myself
into
that
attitude
the
firmer
it
became
and
the
stronger
grew
my
courage
i
gently
moved
aside
the
table
on
which
i
had
been
writing
and
stood
up
once
on
my
feet
i
felt
still
bolder
and
surer
of
myself
and
though
the
shadow
opposite
to
me
looked
darker
and
more
threatening
than
before
i
began
to
move
steadily
towards
it
i
made
an
effort
to
speak
to
it
and
at
last
found
my
voice
whatever
you
are
i
said
aloud
you
can
not
exist
at
all
without
god
will
god
ordains
nothing
that
is
not
for
good
therefore
you
can
not
be
here
with
any
evil
purpose
if
i
am
afraid
of
you
my
fear
is
my
own
weakness
i
will
not
look
at
you
as
a
thing
that
can
or
would
do
me
harm
and
therefore
i
am
coming
to
you
to
find
out
your
meaning
you
shall
prove
to
me
what
you
are
made
of
to
the
very
depth
and
heart
of
your
darkness
you
shall
unveil
to
me
all
that
you
hide
behind
your
terrifying
aspect
because
i
know
that
whatever
your
intention
towards
me
may
be
you
can
not
hurt
my
soul
as
i
spoke
i
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
the
luminous
edge
round
the
phantom
grew
lighter
and
lighter
till
suddenly
a
flash
of
brilliant
colour
like
a
rainbow
glittered
full
on
my
eyes
so
sharply
that
i
fell
back
half
blinded
by
its
splendour
then
as
i
looked
i
dropped
to
my
knees
in
speechless
awe
for
the
shadow
had
changed
to
a
dazzling
shape
of
winged
radiance
a
figure
and
face
so
glorious
that
i
could
only
gaze
and
gaze
with
all
my
soul
entranced
in
wonder
i
heard
delicious
music
around
me
but
i
could
not
listen
all
my
soul
was
in
my
eyes
the
vision
grew
in
stature
and
in
splendour
and
i
stretched
out
my
hands
to
it
in
prayerful
appeal
conscious
that
i
was
in
the
shining
presence
of
some
inhabitant
of
higher
and
more
heavenly
spheres
than
ours
the
beautiful
head
crowned
with
a
diadem
of
flowers
like
white
stars
bent
towards
me
the
luminous
eyes
smiled
into
mine
and
a
voice
sweeter
than
all
sweet
singing
spoke
to
me
in
accents
of
thrilling
tenderness
thou
hast
done
well
it
said
even
so
always
approach
darkness
without
fear
then
shalt
thou
find
the
light
meet
sorrow
with
a
trusting
heart
so
shalt
thou
discover
an
angel
in
disguise
god
thinks
no
evil
of
thee
desires
no
wrong
towards
thee
has
no
punishment
in
store
for
thee
give
thyself
into
his
hand
and
be
at
peace
slowly
like
the
colours
of
the
sunset
melting
away
into
the
grey
of
twilight
the
vision
faded
and
when
i
recovered
from
the
dazzled
bewilderment
into
which
i
had
been
thrown
i
found
myself
again
in
complete
solitude
and
darkness
darkness
unrelieved
save
by
the
dim
light
of
the
setting
moon
i
was
for
a
long
time
unable
to
think
of
anything
but
the
strange
experience
through
which
i
had
just
passed
and
i
wondered
what
would
have
happened
if
instead
of
boldly
advancing
and
confronting
the
dark
phantom
which
had
so
terrified
me
i
had
striven
to
escape
from
it
i
believed
and
i
think
i
was
right
in
my
belief
that
i
should
have
found
every
door
open
and
every
facility
offered
for
a
cowardly
retreat
had
i
chosen
to
make
it
and
then
everything
would
have
been
at
an
end
i
should
have
probably
had
to
leave
the
house
of
aselzion
and
perhaps
i
too
should
have
been
marked
with
a
black
cross
as
a
failure
inwardly
i
rejoiced
that
so
far
i
had
not
given
way
and
presently
yielding
to
a
drowsiness
that
began
to
steal
over
me
i
undressed
and
went
to
bed
perfectly
tranquil
in
mind
and
happy
i
must
have
slept
several
hours
when
i
was
awakened
suddenly
by
the
sound
of
voices
conversing
quite
close
to
me
in
fact
they
seemed
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
against
which
my
bed
was
placed
they
were
men
voices
and
one
or
two
were
curiously
harsh
and
irritable
in
tone
there
was
plenty
of
light
in
my
room
for
the
night
had
passed
and
as
far
as
i
could
tell
it
seemed
to
be
early
morning
the
voices
went
on
and
i
found
myself
compelled
to
listen
aselzion
is
the
cleverest
humbug
of
his
time
said
one
he
is
never
so
happy
as
when
he
can
play
the
little
god
and
dupe
his
worshippers
a
laugh
followed
this
sentence
he
a
marvel
in
his
way
said
another
he
must
be
a
kind
of
descendant
of
some
ancient
egyptian
conjurer
who
had
the
trick
of
playing
with
fire
there
is
nothing
in
the
line
of
miracle
he
can
not
do
and
of
course
those
who
are
ignorant
of
his
methods
and
who
are
credulous
themselves
like
the
woman
here
interposed
the
first
voice
yes
like
the
woman
here
little
fool
and
there
was
more
laughter
fancying
herself
in
love
with
rafel
santoris
i
sat
up
in
bed
straining
my
ears
now
for
every
word
my
cheeks
were
burning
my
heart
beating
i
hardly
knew
what
to
think
there
was
a
silence
for
two
or
three
minutes
minutes
that
seemed
like
ages
in
my
longing
to
hear
more
santoris
always
managed
to
amuse
himself
said
a
thin
sharp
voice
with
a
mocking
ring
in
its
tone
there
was
always
some
woman
or
other
in
love
with
him
some
woman
he
could
take
in
easily
of
course
not
difficult
to
find
rejoined
the
first
voice
that
had
spoken
most
women
are
blind
where
their
affections
are
concerned
or
their
vanity
another
silence
i
rose
from
my
bed
shivering
with
a
sense
of
sudden
cold
and
threw
on
my
going
to
the
window
i
looked
out
on
the
fair
expanse
of
the
calm
sea
in
the
early
dawn
how
still
and
peaceful
it
looked
what
a
contrast
to
the
storm
of
doubt
and
terror
that
was
beginning
to
rage
within
my
own
heart
hush
the
voices
began
again
well
it
all
over
now
and
his
theory
of
perpetuating
life
at
pleasure
has
come
to
an
untimely
end
where
did
the
yacht
go
down
off
armadale
in
skye
for
a
moment
i
could
not
realise
what
had
been
said
and
tried
to
repeat
both
question
and
answer
did
the
yacht
go
down
armadale
in
skye
what
did
it
mean
the
yacht
gone
down
what
yacht
they
were
talking
of
santoris
of
rafel
my
beloved
my
lover
lost
through
ages
of
time
and
space
and
found
again
only
to
be
once
more
separated
from
me
through
my
own
fault
my
own
fault
that
was
the
horror
of
it
a
horror
i
could
not
contemplate
without
an
almost
maddening
anguish
i
ran
to
the
wall
through
which
i
had
heard
the
voices
talking
and
pressed
my
ear
against
it
murmuring
to
myself
oh
no
it
is
not
possible
not
possible
god
would
not
be
so
cruel
for
many
minutes
i
heard
nothing
and
i
was
rapidly
losing
patience
and
when
at
last
i
heard
the
conversation
resumed
he
should
never
have
risked
his
life
in
such
a
vessel
said
one
of
the
voices
in
a
somewhat
gentler
tone
it
was
a
wonderfully
clever
contrivance
but
the
danger
of
all
that
electricity
was
obvious
in
a
storm
it
would
have
no
chance
that
has
been
thoroughly
proved
answered
another
voice
just
half
a
gale
of
wind
with
a
dash
of
thunder
and
lightning
and
down
it
went
with
every
soul
on
board
santoris
might
have
saved
himself
he
was
a
fine
swimmer
was
he
another
silence
i
thought
my
head
would
have
burst
with
its
aching
agony
of
suspense
my
eyes
were
burning
like
hot
coals
with
a
weight
of
unshed
tears
i
felt
that
i
could
have
battered
down
the
wall
between
me
and
those
torturing
voices
in
my
feverish
desire
to
know
the
worst
the
worst
at
all
costs
if
rafel
were
dead
but
no
he
could
not
die
he
could
not
actually
perish
but
he
could
be
parted
from
me
as
he
had
been
parted
before
and
i
i
should
be
alone
again
alone
as
i
had
been
all
my
life
and
in
my
foolish
pride
i
had
voluntarily
severed
myself
from
him
was
this
my
punishment
more
talking
began
and
i
listened
like
a
criminal
listening
to
a
cruel
sentence
aselzion
will
tell
her
of
course
rather
a
difficult
business
as
he
will
have
to
admit
that
his
teachings
are
not
infallible
and
on
the
whole
there
was
something
very
taking
about
santoris
i
sorry
gone
but
he
would
only
have
fooled
the
woman
had
he
lived
oh
that
naturally
but
that
hardly
matters
she
would
only
have
had
herself
to
blame
for
falling
into
the
trap
i
drew
myself
away
from
the
wall
trembling
and
sick
with
dread
mechanically
i
dressed
myself
and
stared
out
at
the
gold
of
the
sun
which
was
now
pouring
its
radiance
full
on
the
sea
the
beauty
of
the
scene
moved
me
not
at
all
nothing
mattered
all
that
my
consciousness
could
take
in
was
that
according
to
what
i
had
heard
rafel
was
dead
drowned
in
the
sea
over
which
his
fairy
vessel
the
had
sailed
so
lightly
and
that
all
he
had
said
of
our
knowledge
of
each
other
in
former
lives
and
of
the
love
which
had
drawn
us
together
was
mere
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
my
eyes
rested
on
the
little
crimson
rose
that
still
blossomed
against
the
wall
in
fragrant
confidence
and
then
i
spoke
aloud
hardly
conscious
of
my
own
words
it
is
wicked
i
said
wicked
of
god
to
allow
us
to
imagine
beautiful
things
that
have
no
existence
it
is
cruel
to
ordain
us
to
love
if
love
must
end
in
disappointment
and
treachery
it
would
be
better
to
teach
us
at
once
that
life
is
intended
to
be
hard
and
plain
and
without
tenderness
or
truth
than
to
lead
our
souls
into
a
fool
paradise
then
all
at
once
i
remembered
the
dark
phantom
of
the
night
and
its
transformation
into
the
vision
of
an
angel
i
had
struggled
against
the
terror
of
its
first
spectral
appearance
and
had
conquered
my
fears
why
was
i
now
shaken
from
my
what
was
the
cause
voices
merely
voices
behind
a
wall
that
spoke
of
death
and
falsehood
voices
belonging
to
persons
i
did
not
know
and
could
not
see
like
the
voices
of
the
world
which
delight
in
uttering
scandals
and
cruelties
and
which
never
praise
so
much
as
they
condemn
voices
merely
ah
but
they
spoke
of
the
death
of
him
whom
i
loved
must
i
not
listen
they
spoke
of
his
treachery
and
should
i
not
hear
and
yet
who
were
those
persons
if
persons
they
were
who
talked
of
him
with
such
easy
callousness
i
had
met
no
one
in
the
house
of
aselzion
save
aselzion
himself
and
his
servant
or
secretary
honorius
who
then
could
there
be
except
those
two
to
know
the
reasons
that
had
brought
me
hither
i
began
to
question
myself
and
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
the
terrible
news
i
had
inadvertently
overheard
if
any
evil
had
chanced
to
rafel
santoris
would
aselzion
have
told
me
he
was
and
well
when
he
had
conjured
up
for
my
comfort
the
picture
of
the
yacht
on
the
moonlit
sea
only
a
few
hours
ago
yet
with
my
bravest
effort
i
could
not
recover
myself
sufficiently
to
be
quite
at
peace
and
in
my
restless
condition
of
mind
i
looked
towards
the
turret
door
opening
to
the
stairway
which
led
to
the
little
garden
below
and
the
seashore
but
it
was
fast
shut
and
i
remembered
aselzion
had
locked
it
but
to
my
complete
surprise
another
door
stood
open
a
door
that
had
seemed
part
of
the
wall
and
a
small
room
was
disclosed
beyond
it
a
kind
of
little
shrine
hung
with
pale
purple
silk
and
looking
as
though
it
were
intended
to
hold
something
infinitely
precious
i
entered
it
hesitatingly
not
sure
whether
i
was
doing
right
or
wrong
and
yet
impelled
by
something
more
than
curiosity
as
i
stepped
across
the
threshold
i
heard
the
voices
behind
the
wall
again
they
sounded
louder
and
more
threatening
and
i
paused
half
afraid
yet
longing
to
know
all
that
might
yet
be
said
though
such
knowledge
might
mean
nothing
but
misery
and
despair
to
me
all
women
are
fools
and
this
trite
observation
was
made
by
someone
speaking
in
harsh
and
bitter
accents
it
is
not
love
that
really
moves
them
so
much
as
the
of
being
loved
no
woman
could
be
faithful
for
long
to
a
dead
man
she
would
lack
the
expected
response
to
her
superabundant
sentimentality
and
she
would
tire
of
waiting
to
meet
him
in
paradise
if
she
believed
in
such
a
possibility
which
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
she
would
not
with
aselzion
there
are
no
dead
men
said
another
of
the
unseen
speakers
they
have
merely
passed
into
another
living
state
and
according
to
his
theories
lovers
can
not
be
separated
even
by
what
is
called
death
for
long
poor
comfort
and
with
the
words
i
heard
a
laugh
of
scornful
mockery
the
women
who
have
loved
rafel
santoris
would
hardly
thank
you
for
it
i
shuddered
a
little
as
with
cold
women
who
have
loved
rafel
santoris
this
phrase
seemed
to
darken
the
very
recollection
of
the
handsome
face
and
form
of
the
man
i
had
almost
unconsciously
to
myself
begun
to
idealise
something
coarse
and
common
suggested
itself
in
association
with
him
and
my
heart
sank
within
me
deprived
of
hope
voices
merely
yet
how
they
tortured
me
if
i
could
only
know
the
truth
i
thought
if
aselzion
would
only
come
and
tell
me
the
worst
at
once
in
a
kind
of
stupor
of
unnameable
grief
i
stood
in
the
little
shrine
so
suddenly
opened
to
me
and
began
to
dreamily
consider
the
unkindness
and
harshness
of
those
voices
ah
so
like
the
voices
of
the
world
voices
that
sneer
and
mock
and
condemn
voices
that
would
rather
utter
a
falsehood
than
any
word
that
should
help
and
comfort
voices
that
take
a
cruel
pleasure
in
saying
just
the
one
thing
that
will
wound
and
crush
an
aspiring
spirit
voices
that
can
not
tune
themselves
to
speak
of
love
without
grudging
bitterness
and
scorn
voices
ah
god
if
only
all
the
harsh
and
calumniating
voices
of
humanity
were
stilled
what
a
heaven
this
earth
would
be
and
yet
why
should
we
listen
to
them
what
have
they
really
to
do
with
us
is
the
soul
to
be
moved
from
its
centre
by
casual
opinion
what
is
it
to
me
that
this
person
or
that
person
approves
or
disapproves
my
actions
why
should
i
be
disturbed
by
rumours
or
frightened
by
ill
report
absorbed
in
these
thoughts
i
hardly
realised
the
almost
religious
peace
of
my
surroundings
and
it
was
only
when
the
voices
ceased
for
a
few
minutes
that
i
saw
what
was
contained
in
this
small
room
i
had
half
unwittingly
entered
an
exquisite
little
table
apparently
made
of
crystal
which
shone
like
a
diamond
and
on
the
table
an
open
book
a
chair
was
placed
in
position
for
the
evident
purpose
of
reading
and
as
i
approached
at
first
indifferently
and
then
with
awakening
interest
i
saw
that
the
open
book
showed
an
inscription
on
its
to
a
faithful
from
aselzion
was
faithful
student
i
asked
myself
the
question
doubtingly
there
was
no
in
fears
and
depressions
here
was
i
shaken
in
part
from
from
the
mere
hearing
of
voices
behind
a
wall
i
who
had
said
that
god
ordains
nothing
that
is
not
for
good
was
suddenly
ready
to
believe
that
he
had
ordained
the
death
of
the
lover
to
whom
his
laws
had
guided
me
i
to
whom
had
been
vouchsafed
the
beatific
vision
of
an
angel
an
angel
who
had
said
god
thinks
no
evil
of
thee
desires
no
wrong
towards
thee
has
no
punishment
in
store
for
thee
give
thyself
into
his
hand
and
be
at
peace
was
already
flinching
and
turning
away
from
the
faith
that
should
keep
me
strong
a
sense
of
shame
stole
over
me
and
almost
timidly
i
approached
the
table
on
which
the
open
book
lay
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
so
invitingly
placed
i
had
scarcely
done
this
when
the
voices
began
again
in
rather
louder
and
angrier
tones
she
imagines
she
can
learn
the
secret
of
life
a
woman
too
the
brazen
arrogance
of
such
an
attempt
no
no
it
is
not
the
secret
of
life
she
wants
to
discover
so
much
as
the
secret
of
perpetual
youth
that
to
a
woman
is
everything
to
be
always
young
and
always
fair
what
feminine
thing
would
not
for
such
merchandise
a
loud
laugh
followed
this
observation
santoris
was
well
on
his
way
to
the
goal
said
a
voice
that
was
suave
and
calm
of
accent
certainly
no
one
would
have
guessed
his
real
age
he
had
all
the
ardour
and
passion
of
youth
said
another
voice
the
fire
of
love
ran
as
warmly
in
his
veins
as
though
he
were
a
romeo
none
of
the
coldness
and
reluctance
of
age
affected
him
where
the
fair
sex
was
concerned
more
laughter
followed
i
sat
rigidly
in
the
chair
by
the
crystal
table
listening
to
every
word
the
woman
here
is
the
latest
victim
of
his
hypnotic
suggestions
she
yes
one
may
say
his
last
victim
he
will
victimise
no
more
i
suppose
if
aselzion
told
her
the
truth
she
would
go
at
once
of
course
why
should
she
remain
it
is
only
a
dream
of
love
that
has
brought
her
here
when
she
knows
the
dream
is
over
there
will
be
nothing
left
true
nothing
left
the
whole
world
a
desert
and
heaven
itself
without
hope
i
pressed
my
hands
to
my
eyes
to
try
and
cool
their
burning
ache
was
it
possible
that
what
these
voices
said
could
be
true
they
had
ceased
speaking
and
there
was
a
blessed
silence
as
a
kind
of
desperate
resource
i
took
out
the
letter
rafel
santoris
had
written
to
me
and
read
its
every
word
with
an
eager
passion
of
yearning
especially
the
one
passage
that
ran
thus
we
you
and
i
who
know
that
life
being
all
life
can
not
die
ought
to
be
wiser
in
our
present
space
of
time
than
to
doubt
each
other
infinite
capability
for
love
and
the
perfect
world
of
beauty
which
love
creates
than
to
doubt
ah
i
was
not
wise
enough
i
was
full
of
doubts
and
imagined
evils
and
why
because
of
voices
behind
a
wall
surely
a
foolish
cause
for
sorrow
i
tried
to
extricate
my
mind
from
the
darkness
of
despondency
into
which
it
had
fallen
and
to
distract
my
attention
from
my
own
unhappy
thoughts
i
glanced
at
the
book
which
lay
open
before
me
as
i
looked
its
title
printed
in
letters
of
gold
flashed
on
my
eyes
like
a
gleam
of
the
sun
secret
of
life
a
sudden
keen
expectancy
stirred
in
me
i
folded
rafel
letter
and
slipped
it
back
into
its
near
my
heart
then
i
drew
my
chair
close
up
to
the
table
and
bending
over
the
book
began
to
read
all
was
now
perfectly
still
around
me
the
voices
had
ceased
gradually
i
became
aware
that
what
i
was
reading
was
intended
for
my
instruction
and
that
the
book
itself
was
a
gift
to
me
from
aselzion
if
i
proved
a
student
a
thrill
of
hope
and
gratitude
began
to
relieve
the
cold
weight
upon
my
heart
and
i
suddenly
resolved
that
i
would
not
listen
to
any
more
voices
even
if
they
spoke
again
rafel
santoris
is
not
dead
i
said
aloud
and
resolutely
he
could
not
so
sever
himself
from
me
now
he
is
not
treacherous
he
is
true
he
is
not
me
he
is
relying
upon
me
to
believe
in
him
and
i
will
believe
in
him
my
love
and
faith
shall
not
be
shaken
by
mere
rumour
i
will
give
him
no
cause
to
think
me
weak
or
cowardly
i
will
trust
him
to
the
end
and
with
these
words
spoken
to
the
air
i
went
on
reading
quietly
in
a
stillness
made
suddenly
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
unseen
flowers
xvii
the
magic
book
it
is
not
possible
here
to
transcribe
more
than
a
few
extracts
from
the
book
on
which
my
attention
now
became
completely
riveted
the
passages
selected
are
chosen
simply
because
they
may
by
chance
be
useful
to
those
few
those
very
few
who
desire
to
make
of
their
lives
something
more
than
a
mere
buy
and
sell
business
and
also
because
they
can
hardly
be
called
difficult
to
understand
when
paracelsus
wrote
secret
of
long
life
he
did
so
in
a
fashion
sufficiently
abstruse
and
complex
to
scare
away
all
but
the
most
diligent
and
persevering
of
students
this
no
doubt
being
his
intention
but
the
instructions
given
in
the
volume
placed
as
i
imagined
for
my
perusal
were
simple
and
in
accordance
with
many
of
the
facts
discovered
by
modern
science
and
as
i
read
on
and
on
i
began
to
see
light
through
the
darkness
and
to
gain
a
perception
of
the
way
in
which
i
might
become
an
adept
in
what
the
world
deems
but
which
after
all
is
nothing
but
the
scientific
application
of
common
sense
to
begin
with
i
will
quote
the
following
headed
life
and
its
adjustment
life
is
the
divine
impetus
of
love
the
force
behind
the
universe
is
love
and
from
that
love
is
bred
desire
and
creation
even
as
the
human
lover
passionately
craves
possession
of
his
beloved
so
that
from
their
mutual
tenderness
the
children
of
love
are
born
the
divine
spirit
immortally
creative
and
desirous
of
perfect
beauty
possesses
space
with
eternal
energy
producing
millions
of
solar
systems
each
one
of
which
has
a
different
organisation
and
a
separate
individuality
man
the
creature
of
our
small
planet
the
earth
is
but
a
single
result
of
the
resistless
output
of
divine
fecundity
nevertheless
man
is
the
of
god
in
that
he
is
endowed
with
reason
will
and
intelligence
beyond
that
of
the
purely
animal
creation
and
that
he
is
given
an
immortal
soul
formed
for
love
and
for
the
eternal
things
which
love
creates
he
can
himself
be
divine
in
the
desire
and
perpetuation
of
life
considered
in
a
strictly
material
sense
he
is
simply
an
embodied
force
composed
of
atoms
held
together
in
a
certain
organised
form
but
within
this
organised
form
is
contained
a
spiritual
being
capable
of
guiding
and
controlling
its
earthly
vehicle
and
adjusting
it
to
surroundings
and
circumstances
in
his
dual
nature
man
has
the
power
of
holding
his
under
his
own
command
he
can
renew
them
or
destroy
them
at
pleasure
he
generally
elects
to
destroy
them
through
selfishness
and
obstinacy
the
two
chief
disintegrating
elements
of
his
mortal
composition
hence
the
result
which
he
calls
but
which
is
merely
the
necessary
transposition
of
his
existence
which
he
has
himself
brought
about
into
a
more
useful
phase
if
he
were
to
learn
once
for
all
that
he
can
prolong
his
life
on
this
earth
in
youth
and
health
for
an
indefinite
period
in
which
days
and
years
are
not
counted
but
only
psychic
or
seasons
he
could
pass
from
one
joy
to
another
from
one
triumph
to
another
as
easily
as
breathing
the
air
it
is
judged
good
for
a
man
body
that
he
should
stand
upright
and
that
he
should
move
his
limbs
with
grace
and
ease
performing
physical
exercises
for
the
improvement
and
strengthening
of
his
muscles
and
he
is
not
considered
a
fool
for
any
feats
of
physical
valour
or
ability
which
he
may
accomplish
why
then
should
he
not
train
his
soul
to
stand
as
upright
as
his
body
so
that
it
may
take
full
possession
of
all
the
powers
which
natural
and
spiritual
energy
can
provide
reader
and
student
you
for
whom
these
words
are
written
learn
and
remember
that
the
secret
strength
and
renewal
of
life
is
adjustment
the
adjustment
of
the
atoms
whereof
the
body
is
composed
to
the
commands
of
the
soul
be
the
god
of
your
own
universe
control
your
own
solar
system
that
it
may
warm
and
revivify
you
with
an
ever
recurring
spring
make
love
the
summer
of
your
life
and
let
it
create
within
you
the
passion
of
noble
desire
the
fervour
of
joy
the
fire
of
idealism
and
faith
know
yourself
as
part
of
the
divine
spirit
of
all
things
and
be
divine
in
your
own
creative
existence
the
whole
universe
is
open
to
the
searchings
of
your
soul
if
love
be
the
torch
to
light
your
way
having
read
thus
far
i
paused
the
little
room
in
which
i
sat
appeared
darker
or
was
it
my
fancy
i
listened
for
the
voices
which
had
so
confused
and
worried
me
but
there
was
no
sound
i
turned
the
pages
of
the
book
before
me
and
found
the
following
the
action
of
thought
thought
is
an
actual
motive
force
more
powerful
than
any
other
motive
force
in
the
world
it
is
not
the
mere
pulsation
in
a
particular
set
of
brain
cells
destined
to
pass
away
into
nothingness
when
the
pulsation
has
ceased
thought
is
the
voice
of
the
soul
just
as
the
human
voice
is
transmitted
through
distance
on
the
telephone
wires
so
is
the
soul
voice
carried
through
the
radiant
fibres
connected
with
the
nerves
to
the
brain
the
brain
receives
it
but
can
not
keep
it
for
it
again
is
transmitted
by
its
own
electric
power
to
other
brains
and
you
can
no
more
keep
a
thought
to
yourself
than
you
can
hold
a
monopoly
in
the
sunshine
everywhere
in
all
worlds
throughout
the
whole
cosmos
souls
are
speaking
through
the
material
medium
of
the
brain
souls
that
may
not
inhabit
this
world
at
all
but
that
may
be
as
far
away
from
us
as
the
last
star
visible
to
the
strongest
telescope
the
harmonies
that
suggest
themselves
to
the
musician
here
may
have
fallen
from
sirius
or
jupiter
striking
on
his
earthly
brain
with
a
spiritual
sweetness
from
worlds
unknown
the
poet
writes
what
he
scarcely
realises
obeying
the
inspiration
of
his
dreams
we
are
all
at
our
best
but
mediums
for
conveying
thought
first
receiving
it
from
other
spheres
to
ourselves
and
then
transmitting
it
from
ourselves
to
others
shakespeare
the
chief
poet
and
prophet
of
the
world
has
written
is
nothing
good
or
bad
but
thinking
makes
it
so
thus
giving
out
a
profound
truth
one
of
the
most
profound
truths
of
the
psychic
creed
for
what
we
think
we
are
and
our
thoughts
resolve
themselves
into
our
actions
in
the
renewal
of
life
and
the
preservation
of
youth
thought
is
the
chief
factor
if
we
think
we
are
old
we
age
rapidly
if
on
the
contrary
we
think
we
are
young
we
preserve
our
vitality
indefinitely
the
action
of
thought
influences
the
living
particles
of
which
our
bodies
are
composed
so
that
we
positively
age
them
or
rejuvenate
them
by
the
attitude
we
assume
the
thinking
attitude
of
the
human
soul
should
be
one
of
gratitude
love
and
joy
there
is
no
room
in
spiritual
nature
for
fear
depression
sickness
or
death
god
intends
his
creation
to
be
happy
and
by
bringing
the
soul
and
body
both
into
tune
with
happiness
we
obey
his
laws
and
fulfil
his
desire
therefore
to
live
long
encourage
thoughts
of
happiness
avoid
all
persons
who
talk
of
disease
misery
and
decay
for
these
things
are
the
crimes
of
man
and
are
offences
against
god
primal
design
of
beauty
drink
in
deep
draughts
of
sunshine
and
fresh
air
inhale
the
perfume
of
flowers
and
trees
keep
far
away
from
cities
and
from
crowds
seek
no
wealth
that
is
not
earned
by
hand
or
brain
and
above
all
things
remember
that
the
children
of
light
may
walk
in
the
light
without
fear
of
darkness
something
in
this
latter
sentence
made
me
stop
and
look
again
around
me
and
again
i
felt
sure
that
the
room
was
growing
darker
and
not
only
darker
but
smaller
the
purple
silk
hangings
which
draped
the
walls
were
almost
within
my
touch
and
i
knew
they
had
not
been
so
close
to
me
when
i
first
sat
down
to
read
a
nervous
tremor
ran
through
me
but
i
resolved
i
would
not
be
the
dupe
of
my
own
fancy
and
i
set
myself
once
more
resolutely
to
the
study
of
the
volume
before
me
the
next
paragraph
which
attracted
me
was
headed
on
the
command
of
life
forces
and
began
thus
to
live
long
you
must
have
perfect
control
of
the
forces
that
engender
life
the
atoms
of
which
your
body
is
composed
are
in
perpetual
movement
your
spiritual
self
must
guide
them
in
the
way
they
should
go
otherwise
they
resemble
an
army
without
organisation
or
equipment
easily
put
to
rout
by
a
first
assault
if
you
have
them
under
your
spiritual
orders
you
are
practically
immune
from
all
disease
disease
can
never
enter
your
system
save
through
some
unguarded
corner
you
may
meet
with
accident
through
the
fault
of
others
or
through
your
own
wilfulness
if
through
your
own
wilfulness
you
have
only
yourself
to
blame
if
through
the
fault
of
others
you
may
know
that
it
was
a
destined
and
removal
of
yourself
from
a
sphere
for
which
you
are
judged
to
be
unfitted
barring
such
accident
your
life
need
know
no
end
even
on
this
earth
your
spirit
called
the
soul
is
a
creature
of
light
and
it
can
supply
revivifying
rays
to
every
atom
and
cell
in
your
body
without
stint
or
cessation
it
is
an
exhaustless
supply
of
from
which
the
forces
of
your
life
may
draw
perpetual
sustenance
man
uses
every
exterior
means
of
but
forgets
the
interior
power
he
possesses
which
was
bestowed
upon
him
that
he
might
the
earth
and
subdue
it
to
the
earth
is
to
give
out
love
ungrudgingly
to
all
nature
to
the
earth
is
first
to
master
the
atoms
of
which
the
human
organisation
is
composed
and
hold
them
completely
under
control
so
that
by
means
of
this
mastery
all
other
atomic
movements
and
forces
upon
this
planet
and
its
encircling
atmosphere
may
be
equally
controlled
much
is
talked
of
the
rays
which
pierce
solid
matter
as
though
it
were
nothing
but
clear
air
yet
this
discovery
is
but
the
beginning
of
wonders
there
are
rays
which
divine
metals
even
as
the
hazel
wand
divines
the
presence
of
water
and
the
treasures
of
the
earth
the
gold
the
silver
the
jewels
and
precious
things
that
are
hidden
beneath
its
surface
and
in
the
depth
of
the
sea
can
be
seen
in
their
darkest
recesses
by
the
penetrating
flash
of
a
ray
as
yet
unknown
to
any
but
adepts
in
the
psychic
creed
no
true
adept
is
ever
poor
poverty
can
not
exist
where
perfect
control
of
the
life
forces
is
maintained
gladness
peace
and
plenty
must
naturally
attend
the
soul
that
is
in
tune
with
nature
and
life
is
always
perpetuated
from
the
joy
of
life
stand
therefore
o
patient
student
erect
and
firm
let
the
radiating
force
of
the
soul
possess
every
nerve
and
of
the
body
and
learn
to
command
all
things
pertaining
to
good
with
that
strength
which
compels
obedience
not
idly
did
the
supreme
master
speak
when
he
told
his
disciples
that
if
their
faith
were
but
as
a
grain
of
mustard
seed
they
could
command
a
mountain
to
be
cast
into
the
sea
and
it
would
obey
remember
that
the
spirit
within
your
bodily
house
of
clay
is
divine
and
of
god
and
that
with
god
all
things
are
possible
i
raised
my
head
from
its
bent
position
over
the
book
and
drew
a
long
breath
something
oppressed
me
with
a
sense
of
suffocation
and
looking
up
i
saw
that
i
was
being
steadily
closed
in
as
by
a
contracting
cage
the
little
room
draped
with
its
soft
purple
hangings
was
now
too
small
for
me
to
move
about
i
was
pinned
to
my
chair
and
the
ceiling
was
apparently
descending
upon
me
with
a
shock
of
horrified
memory
i
recalled
the
old
torture
of
the
tomb
practised
by
the
spanish
inquisition
when
the
wretched
victim
was
compelled
to
watch
the
walls
of
his
prison
slowly
narrowing
round
him
inch
by
inch
till
he
was
crushed
to
death
how
could
i
be
sure
that
no
such
cruelties
were
used
among
the
mysterious
members
of
a
mysterious
brotherhood
whose
avowed
object
of
study
was
the
searching
out
of
the
secret
of
life
i
made
an
effort
to
rise
and
found
i
could
stand
upright
and
there
straight
opposite
to
me
was
the
entrance
to
my
own
room
from
which
i
had
wandered
into
this
small
inner
chamber
it
seemed
easy
enough
to
get
there
and
yet
i
found
myself
hindered
by
an
invisible
barrier
i
stood
with
my
heart
beating
nervously
wondering
what
was
my
threatening
danger
almost
involuntarily
my
eyes
still
perused
the
printed
page
of
the
book
before
me
and
i
read
the
following
sentences
in
a
kind
of
waking
dream
to
the
soul
that
will
not
study
the
needs
of
its
immortal
nature
life
itself
becomes
a
narrow
cell
all
god
creation
waits
upon
it
to
supply
what
it
shall
demand
yet
it
starves
in
the
midst
of
plenty
fear
suspicion
distrust
anger
envy
and
callousness
paralyse
its
being
and
destroy
its
action
love
courage
patience
sweetness
generosity
and
sympathy
are
actual
to
it
and
to
the
body
it
inhabits
all
the
influences
of
the
social
world
work
against
it
all
the
influences
of
the
natural
world
work
with
it
there
is
nothing
of
pure
nature
that
will
not
obey
its
behest
and
this
should
be
enough
for
its
happy
existence
sorrow
and
despair
result
from
the
misguidance
of
the
will
there
is
no
other
cause
in
earth
or
heaven
for
any
pain
or
trouble
misguidance
of
the
will
i
spoke
the
words
aloud
then
went
on
reading
what
is
heaven
a
state
of
perfect
happiness
what
is
happiness
the
immortal
union
of
two
souls
in
one
creatures
of
god
eternal
light
partaking
each
other
thoughts
bestowing
upon
each
other
the
renewal
of
joy
and
creating
loveliness
in
form
and
action
by
their
mutual
sympathy
and
tenderness
age
can
not
touch
them
death
has
no
meaning
for
them
life
is
their
air
and
space
and
movement
life
palpitates
through
them
and
warms
them
with
colour
and
glory
as
the
sunshine
warms
and
reddens
the
petals
of
the
rose
they
grow
beyond
mortality
and
are
immune
from
all
disaster
they
are
a
world
in
themselves
involuntarily
creating
other
worlds
as
they
pass
from
one
phase
to
another
of
production
and
fruition
for
there
is
no
good
work
accomplished
without
love
no
great
triumph
achieved
without
love
no
fame
no
victory
gained
without
love
the
lovers
of
god
are
the
beloved
of
god
their
passion
is
divine
knowing
no
weariness
no
satiety
no
end
for
god
is
the
supreme
lover
and
there
is
nothing
higher
than
love
here
on
a
sudden
impulse
i
took
up
the
book
closed
it
and
held
it
clasped
in
my
two
hands
as
i
did
this
a
great
darkness
overwhelmed
me
a
sound
like
thunder
crashed
on
my
ears
and
i
felt
the
whole
room
reeling
into
chaos
the
floor
sank
and
i
sank
with
it
down
to
a
great
depth
so
swiftly
that
i
had
no
time
to
think
what
had
happened
till
the
sensation
of
falling
stopped
abruptly
and
i
found
myself
in
a
narrow
green
lane
completely
shadowed
by
the
wide
boughs
of
trees
hardly
could
i
realise
my
surroundings
when
i
saw
rafel
rafel
santoris
himself
walking
towards
me
but
not
alone
the
eager
impulse
to
run
to
him
was
checked
i
stood
quiet
and
cold
to
the
heart
a
woman
was
with
him
a
woman
young
and
very
beautiful
his
arm
was
round
her
and
his
eyes
looked
with
unwearied
tenderness
at
her
face
i
heard
his
voice
caressing
and
infinitely
gentle
beloved
he
said
i
call
you
by
this
name
as
i
have
always
called
you
through
many
cycles
of
time
is
it
not
strange
that
even
the
eager
spirit
craving
for
its
preordained
mate
is
subject
to
error
i
thought
i
had
found
her
whom
i
should
love
a
little
while
before
i
met
you
but
this
was
a
momentary
blindness
you
are
the
one
i
have
sought
for
many
centuries
you
are
the
one
and
only
beloved
promise
never
to
leave
me
again
she
answered
and
i
heard
her
murmur
soft
as
a
sigh
i
promise
still
walking
together
like
lovers
they
came
on
i
knew
they
must
pass
me
and
i
stood
in
their
way
that
rafel
santoris
at
least
might
see
me
might
know
that
i
had
adventured
into
the
house
of
aselzion
for
his
sake
and
that
so
far
i
had
not
failed
if
he
were
false
then
surely
the
failure
would
be
his
with
a
sickening
heart
i
watched
him
approach
his
blue
eyes
rested
on
me
carelessly
with
a
cold
smile
his
fair
companion
glanced
at
me
as
at
a
stranger
and
they
moved
on
and
passed
out
of
sight
i
could
not
have
spoken
had
i
tried
i
was
stricken
dumb
and
feeble
this
was
the
end
then
i
had
made
my
journey
to
no
purpose
he
had
already
found
another
for
his
influence
stunned
and
bewildered
with
the
confusion
of
thought
in
my
brain
i
tried
to
walk
a
few
paces
and
found
the
ground
soft
as
velvet
while
a
cool
breeze
blowing
through
the
trees
refreshed
my
aching
forehead
and
eyes
i
still
held
the
book
secret
of
life
and
in
a
dull
aimless
way
thought
how
useless
it
was
what
does
life
matter
if
love
be
untrue
the
sun
was
shining
somewhere
above
me
for
i
saw
glinting
reflections
of
it
through
the
close
boughs
and
there
were
birds
singing
but
both
beauty
of
sight
and
beauty
of
sound
were
lost
to
me
i
had
no
real
consciousness
left
save
that
the
lover
who
professed
to
love
me
with
an
eternal
love
loved
me
no
more
so
the
world
was
desolate
and
heaven
itself
a
blank
death
and
death
alone
seemed
dear
and
desirable
i
walked
slowly
and
with
difficulty
my
limbs
were
languid
and
i
had
lost
all
courage
if
i
could
have
found
my
way
to
aselzion
i
would
have
told
him
this
is
enough
no
more
do
i
need
the
secret
of
youth
or
life
since
love
has
left
me
presently
i
began
to
think
more
coherently
a
little
while
back
i
had
heard
voices
behind
a
wall
saying
that
rafel
santoris
was
dead
drowned
in
his
own
yacht
armadale
in
skye
if
that
was
true
how
came
he
here
i
questioned
myself
in
vain
till
presently
i
gathered
up
sufficient
force
to
remember
that
love
real
love
knows
no
change
did
i
believe
in
my
lover
love
or
did
i
doubt
it
that
was
a
point
for
my
own
consideration
but
had
i
not
the
testimony
of
my
own
eyes
was
i
not
myselt
the
witness
of
his
altered
mind
here
seeing
a
rustic
seat
under
one
of
the
shadiest
trees
i
sat
down
and
my
mind
gradually
steadied
itself
why
i
inwardly
asked
had
i
been
so
suddenly
and
forcibly
brought
into
this
place
for
no
apparent
reason
save
to
look
upon
rafel
santoris
in
the
company
of
another
woman
whom
it
seemed
that
he
now
preferred
to
me
ought
that
to
make
any
difference
in
my
love
for
him
in
love
if
love
be
love
if
love
be
ours
faith
and
unfaith
can
be
equal
powers
unfaith
in
aught
is
want
of
faith
in
all
if
the
happiness
of
the
one
i
loved
was
obtained
through
other
means
than
mine
ought
i
to
grudge
it
and
yet
my
heart
was
full
of
a
sick
heaviness
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
lately
been
the
possessor
of
an
inestimable
joy
which
had
been
ruthlessly
snatched
from
me
still
meditating
in
solitary
sadness
i
sat
in
the
soft
gloom
wondering
at
the
strange
chance
that
had
brought
me
into
such
a
place
and
curiously
enough
never
thinking
that
the
whole
adventure
might
be
the
result
of
a
design
presently
hearing
slow
footsteps
approaching
i
looked
up
and
saw
an
aged
man
walking
towards
me
accompanied
by
a
woman
of
gentle
and
matronly
appearance
who
supported
him
on
her
arm
the
looks
of
both
these
personages
were
kindly
and
inspired
confidence
at
a
glance
and
i
watched
them
coming
with
a
kind
of
hope
that
perhaps
they
might
explain
my
present
dilemma
i
was
particularly
attracted
by
the
venerable
and
benevolent
aspect
of
the
man
and
as
he
drew
near
seeing
that
he
evidently
intended
to
speak
to
me
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
made
a
step
or
two
forward
to
meet
him
he
inclined
his
head
courteously
and
smiled
upon
me
with
a
grave
and
compassionate
air
i
am
very
glad
he
said
in
a
friendly
tone
that
we
have
not
come
too
late
we
feared
did
we
not
here
he
looked
to
his
companion
for
confirmation
of
his
words
that
you
might
have
been
hopelessly
ensnared
and
victimised
before
we
could
come
to
the
rescue
alas
yes
said
the
woman
in
accents
of
deep
pity
and
that
would
have
been
terrible
indeed
i
stared
at
them
both
utterly
bewildered
they
spoke
of
rescue
rescue
from
what
ensnared
and
victimised
what
did
they
mean
since
i
had
seen
rafel
santoris
with
another
woman
he
called
i
had
felt
almost
incapable
of
speech
but
now
i
found
my
voice
suddenly
i
do
not
understand
you
i
said
as
clearly
and
firmly
as
i
could
i
am
here
by
my
own
desire
and
i
am
not
being
ensnared
or
victimised
why
should
i
need
rescue
the
old
man
shook
his
head
compassionately
poor
child
he
said
are
you
not
a
prisoner
in
the
house
of
aselzion
with
my
own
consent
i
answered
he
lifted
his
hands
in
a
kind
of
appealing
astonishment
and
the
woman
smiled
sadly
not
so
she
told
me
you
are
under
a
very
serious
delusion
you
are
here
by
the
wicked
will
of
rafel
santoris
a
man
who
would
sacrifice
any
life
remorselessly
in
the
support
of
his
own
mad
theories
you
are
under
his
influence
you
poor
creature
so
easily
trapped
too
you
think
you
are
following
your
own
way
and
carrying
out
your
own
wishes
but
you
are
really
the
slave
of
santoris
and
have
been
so
ever
since
you
met
him
you
are
a
mere
instrument
on
which
he
can
play
any
tune
and
she
turned
to
the
old
man
beside
her
with
an
appealing
gesture
is
it
not
so
he
bent
his
head
in
the
affirmative
for
a
moment
my
brain
was
in
a
whirl
could
it
be
possible
that
what
they
said
was
true
their
looks
were
sincere
they
could
have
no
object
but
kindness
in
warning
me
of
intended
mischief
i
tried
to
conceal
the
torturing
anxiety
that
possessed
me
and
asked
quietly
if
you
have
good
reason
to
think
all
this
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
if
i
am
in
danger
how
shall
i
escape
from
it
the
woman
looked
curiously
at
me
and
her
eyes
glittered
with
sudden
interest
her
venerable
companion
replied
to
my
question
escape
is
quite
easy
here
and
now
you
have
only
to
follow
us
and
we
will
take
you
out
of
this
wood
and
escort
you
to
a
place
of
safety
then
you
can
return
to
your
own
home
and
forget
forget
what
i
interrupted
him
all
this
foolishness
he
answered
with
a
gentle
seriousness
this
idea
of
eternal
life
and
love
which
the
artful
conjurer
rafel
santoris
has
instilled
into
your
too
sensitive
and
credulous
imagination
these
fantastic
beliefs
in
the
immortality
and
individuality
of
the
soul
and
you
will
accept
old
age
and
death
with
the
sane
resignation
of
ordinary
mortals
such
love
as
he
professes
to
believe
in
does
not
exist
such
life
can
never
be
and
the
secret
of
his
youth
ah
i
exclaimed
eagerly
tell
me
of
that
and
of
aselzion
splendid
prime
when
he
should
be
old
and
feeble
tell
me
of
that
also
for
the
first
time
during
this
interview
my
two
companions
looked
confused
i
saw
this
and
i
gained
confidence
from
their
evident
embarrassment
why
i
pursued
should
you
come
to
me
with
warnings
against
those
whom
god
or
destiny
has
brought
into
my
life
you
may
perhaps
say
that
you
yourselves
have
been
sent
by
god
but
does
deity
contradict
itself
i
am
not
conscious
of
having
suffered
any
evil
through
rafel
santoris
or
through
aselzion
i
am
pained
and
perplexed
and
tortured
by
what
i
hear
and
see
but
my
hearing
and
sight
are
capable
of
being
deceived
why
should
i
think
of
evil
things
which
are
not
proved
the
woman
surveyed
me
with
sudden
scorn
so
you
will
stay
here
the
dupe
of
your
own
sentiments
and
dreams
she
said
contemptuously
you
a
woman
will
remain
among
a
community
of
men
who
are
known
impostors
and
sacrifice
your
name
and
reputation
to
a
mere
chimera
her
look
and
manner
had
completely
changed
and
i
was
at
once
on
my
guard
my
name
and
reputation
are
my
own
to
protect
i
answered
coldly
whatever
i
do
i
shall
be
ready
to
answer
for
to
anyone
having
the
right
to
ask
the
old
man
now
advanced
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
his
eyes
sparkled
angrily
you
must
be
saved
from
yourself
he
said
sharply
you
must
come
with
us
whether
you
will
or
no
we
have
seen
too
many
victims
of
aselzion
art
already
we
are
resolved
to
save
you
from
the
peril
which
threatens
you
and
he
made
an
effort
to
draw
me
closer
to
him
but
my
spirit
was
up
and
i
held
back
with
all
my
force
no
i
will
not
go
with
you
i
exclaimed
hotly
god
alone
shall
remove
me
from
harm
if
any
harm
is
really
meant
towards
me
i
do
not
believe
one
word
you
have
said
against
rafel
santoris
or
against
aselzion
i
love
the
one
and
i
trust
the
other
let
me
go
my
own
way
in
peace
hardly
had
i
spoken
these
words
when
both
the
old
man
and
woman
threw
themselves
upon
me
and
seizing
me
by
force
endeavoured
to
drag
me
away
with
them
i
resisted
with
all
my
strength
still
holding
tightly
the
book
of
the
of
life
in
one
hand
but
their
united
efforts
were
beginning
to
overpower
me
and
feeling
myself
growing
weaker
and
weaker
i
cried
aloud
in
desperation
rafel
rafel
in
an
instant
i
stood
free
my
captors
loosed
their
hold
of
me
and
i
rushed
away
not
knowing
whither
only
running
running
running
afraid
of
pursuit
till
i
suddenly
found
myself
alone
on
the
borders
of
a
dark
stretch
of
water
spreading
away
in
cold
blackness
to
an
unseen
horizon
xviii
dreams
within
a
dream
i
stopped
abruptly
brought
perforce
to
a
standstill
there
was
nothing
but
the
black
water
heaving
in
front
of
me
with
a
slow
and
dizzying
motion
and
faintly
illumined
by
a
dim
pearly
light
like
that
of
a
waning
moon
i
looked
behind
me
fearing
my
persecutors
were
following
and
saw
that
a
thick
mist
filled
the
air
and
space
to
the
obliteration
of
everything
that
might
otherwise
have
been
visible
i
had
thought
it
was
day
and
that
the
sun
was
shining
but
now
it
appeared
to
be
night
utterly
fatigued
in
body
and
mind
i
sank
down
wearily
on
the
ground
close
to
the
edge
of
the
strange
dark
flood
which
i
could
scarcely
see
the
quiet
and
deep
obscurity
had
a
lulling
effect
on
my
senses
and
i
thought
languidly
how
good
it
would
be
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
rest
where
i
was
for
an
indefinite
time
i
can
understand
i
said
to
myself
why
many
people
long
for
death
and
pray
for
it
as
a
great
blessing
they
have
lost
love
and
without
love
life
is
valueless
to
live
on
and
on
through
cycles
of
time
in
worlds
that
are
empty
of
all
sweetness
companionless
and
deprived
of
hope
and
comfort
this
would
be
hell
not
heaven
hell
not
heaven
said
a
voice
near
me
i
started
and
looked
up
a
shadowy
figure
stood
beside
me
that
of
a
woman
in
dark
trailing
garments
whose
face
shone
with
a
pale
beauty
in
the
dim
light
surrounding
us
both
so
you
have
found
your
way
here
at
last
she
said
gently
here
where
all
things
end
and
nothing
begins
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
confronted
her
where
all
things
end
i
repeated
surely
where
life
exists
there
is
no
end
she
gave
me
a
fleeting
smile
life
is
a
dream
she
said
and
the
things
of
life
are
dreams
within
the
dream
there
are
no
realities
you
imagine
truths
which
are
deceptions
i
looked
at
her
in
wonder
and
bewilderment
she
was
beautiful
and
the
calm
sadness
of
her
eyes
expressed
compassion
and
tenderness
then
is
creation
a
lie
i
asked
she
made
no
immediate
answer
but
pointed
with
one
hand
towards
the
dark
water
i
looked
and
uttered
a
cry
of
ecstasy
there
shining
in
the
heaving
blackness
like
a
vision
from
fairyland
was
the
glittering
from
stem
to
stern
with
light
that
sparkled
like
millions
of
diamonds
your
dream
of
love
said
the
woman
beside
me
behold
it
for
the
last
time
with
straining
eyes
and
beating
heart
i
watched
and
saw
the
shining
vessel
begin
to
sink
slowly
into
the
deep
watery
blackness
down
down
still
lower
till
only
her
masts
were
visible
then
something
defiant
and
forceful
sprang
up
within
me
i
would
master
this
torture
i
thought
i
would
not
yield
to
the
agony
that
threatened
to
drive
me
to
utter
despair
this
is
a
phantom
of
sorrow
i
said
it
has
no
meaning
the
love
that
is
in
my
heart
is
my
own
it
is
my
life
my
soul
my
inmost
being
it
is
eternal
as
god
himself
and
to
him
i
commend
it
i
spoke
these
words
aloud
holding
the
book
of
the
of
clasped
to
my
breast
and
raised
my
eyes
trustfully
to
the
dense
darkness
which
should
have
been
the
sky
then
i
felt
the
woman
hand
on
mine
her
touch
was
warm
and
gentle
come
she
said
softly
and
i
saw
a
small
boat
slip
out
on
the
gloomy
water
guided
towards
me
by
one
whose
face
was
hidden
in
a
fold
of
black
my
companion
drew
me
with
her
and
signed
to
me
to
enter
something
in
myself
as
well
as
in
her
looks
impelled
me
to
obey
and
as
she
stepped
into
the
boat
i
followed
we
were
borne
along
in
silence
for
what
seemed
to
me
a
long
time
till
suddenly
i
began
to
hear
strange
sounds
of
wailing
and
shuddering
cries
of
appeal
and
our
darkness
was
lightened
by
the
drifting
to
and
fro
of
pale
forms
that
were
luminous
and
human
in
shape
though
scarcely
of
human
resemblance
what
are
these
i
whispered
my
companion
took
my
hand
and
held
it
listen
she
answered
and
gradually
out
of
a
clamour
of
weeping
and
complaint
i
heard
voices
which
uttered
distinct
things
i
am
the
phantom
of
wealth
said
one
for
me
men
and
nations
have
rushed
on
destruction
for
me
they
have
sacrificed
happiness
and
missed
the
way
to
god
for
me
innocence
has
been
betrayed
and
honour
murdered
i
am
but
a
shadow
but
the
world
follows
me
as
if
i
were
light
i
am
but
the
gold
dust
of
earth
and
men
take
me
for
the
glory
of
heaven
i
am
the
phantom
of
fame
said
another
i
come
with
music
and
sweet
promises
i
float
before
the
eyes
of
man
seeming
to
him
an
angel
i
speak
of
triumph
and
power
and
for
me
brave
hearts
have
broken
and
bright
spirits
have
been
doomed
to
despair
i
am
but
a
shadow
but
the
world
believes
me
substance
i
am
but
a
breath
and
a
colour
but
men
take
me
for
a
fixed
star
i
am
the
phantom
of
pride
said
a
third
voice
for
me
humanity
scales
the
height
of
ambition
for
my
sake
king
and
queens
occupy
uneasy
thrones
and
surround
themselves
with
pomp
and
panoply
for
me
men
lie
and
cheat
and
wrong
their
neighbours
for
me
the
homes
that
should
be
happy
are
laid
waste
for
me
false
laws
are
made
and
evil
conquers
good
i
am
but
a
shadow
and
the
world
takes
me
for
the
sun
i
am
but
a
passing
flash
of
light
and
men
take
me
for
the
perfect
day
other
voices
joined
in
and
echoed
wildly
around
me
and
i
rose
up
in
the
boat
loosing
my
hold
from
the
clasp
of
the
woman
who
was
with
me
you
are
phantoms
all
i
cried
half
unconscious
of
my
own
words
i
want
god
angels
where
is
love
the
voices
ceased
the
strange
flitting
figures
that
wailed
round
me
faded
away
into
mist
and
disappeared
and
a
light
deep
and
golden
and
wonderful
began
to
shine
through
the
gloom
my
companion
spoke
we
have
been
looking
at
dreams
she
said
you
ask
for
the
only
real
i
smiled
a
sudden
inrush
of
strength
and
authority
possessed
me
you
bade
me
look
my
last
upon
my
dream
of
love
i
said
but
you
knew
that
was
impossible
for
love
is
no
dream
the
golden
radiance
widened
into
a
perfect
splendour
and
our
boat
now
glided
over
a
shining
sea
as
in
a
vision
i
saw
the
figure
that
steered
and
guided
it
change
from
darkness
to
brightness
the
black
fold
fell
from
its
face
angel
eyes
looked
at
me
angel
lips
smiled
and
then
i
found
myself
suddenly
alone
on
the
shore
of
a
little
bay
blue
as
a
sapphire
in
the
reflection
of
the
blue
sky
above
it
the
black
stretch
of
water
which
had
seemed
so
dreary
and
impassable
had
disappeared
and
to
my
astonishment
i
recognised
the
very
shore
near
the
rock
garden
which
was
immediately
under
my
turret
room
i
looked
everywhere
for
the
woman
who
had
been
in
the
boat
with
me
for
the
boat
itself
and
its
guide
but
there
was
no
trace
of
them
where
and
how
far
i
had
wandered
i
could
not
imagine
but
presently
regaining
nerve
and
courage
i
began
to
fancy
that
perhaps
my
strange
experience
had
been
preordained
and
planned
as
some
test
of
my
faith
and
fortitude
had
i
failed
surely
not
for
i
had
not
doubted
the
truth
of
god
or
the
power
of
love
there
was
only
one
thing
which
puzzled
me
the
memory
of
those
voices
behind
a
wall
the
voices
which
had
spoken
of
rafel
death
and
treachery
i
could
not
quite
rid
myself
of
the
anxiety
they
had
awakened
in
my
mind
though
i
tried
hard
not
to
yield
to
the
temptation
of
fear
and
suspicion
i
knew
and
felt
that
after
all
it
is
the
voices
of
the
world
which
work
most
harm
to
love
and
that
neither
poverty
nor
sorrow
can
cut
the
threads
of
affection
between
lovers
so
swiftly
as
falsehood
and
calumny
and
yet
i
allowed
myself
to
be
moved
by
vague
uneasiness
on
this
account
and
could
not
entirely
regain
perfect
composure
the
door
of
the
winding
stair
leading
to
my
room
in
the
turret
stood
open
and
i
availed
myself
of
this
tacit
permission
to
return
thither
i
found
everything
as
i
had
left
it
except
that
when
i
sought
for
the
mysterious
little
room
hung
with
purple
silk
where
i
had
begun
to
read
the
book
called
secret
of
life
a
book
which
through
all
my
strange
adventure
i
still
had
managed
to
keep
with
me
i
could
not
find
it
the
walls
around
me
were
solid
there
was
no
sign
of
an
opening
anywhere
i
sat
down
by
the
window
to
think
there
before
my
eyes
was
the
sea
calm
and
in
the
full
radiance
of
a
brilliant
sun
no
mysterious
or
magic
art
suggested
itself
in
the
visible
scene
of
a
smiling
summer
day
had
i
been
long
absent
from
this
room
i
wondered
i
could
not
tell
time
seemed
to
be
annihilated
and
so
far
as
i
myself
was
concerned
i
desired
nothing
in
this
world
or
the
next
save
just
to
know
if
rafel
santoris
still
lived
and
yes
one
other
assurance
to
feel
that
i
still
possessed
the
treasure
of
his
love
all
the
past
present
and
future
hung
on
this
possibility
there
was
nothing
more
to
hope
for
or
to
attain
for
if
i
had
lost
love
then
god
himself
could
give
me
no
comfort
since
the
essential
link
with
divine
things
was
broken
gradually
a
great
and
soothing
quietude
stole
over
me
and
the
cloud
of
depression
that
had
hung
over
my
mind
began
to
clear
i
thought
of
my
recent
experience
with
the
man
and
woman
who
had
sought
to
me
as
they
said
and
how
when
in
sheer
desperation
i
had
called
rafel
rafel
they
had
suddenly
disappeared
and
left
me
free
surely
this
was
a
sufficient
proof
that
i
was
not
forgotten
by
him
who
had
professed
to
love
me
and
that
his
aid
might
still
be
depended
upon
why
should
i
doubt
him
i
had
placed
my
book
secret
of
life
on
the
table
when
i
my
room
but
now
i
took
it
up
again
and
the
pages
fell
open
at
the
following
passage
when
once
you
possess
the
inestimable
treasure
of
love
remember
that
every
effort
will
be
made
to
snatch
it
from
you
there
is
nothing
the
world
envies
so
much
as
a
happy
soul
those
who
have
been
your
dearest
friends
will
turn
against
you
because
you
have
a
joy
in
which
they
do
not
share
they
will
unite
with
your
foes
to
drag
you
down
from
your
height
of
paradise
the
powers
of
the
coarse
and
commonplace
will
be
arrayed
against
you
shafts
of
disdain
and
ridicule
will
be
hurled
at
your
tenderest
feelings
venomous
lies
and
cruel
calumnies
will
be
circulated
around
you
all
to
try
and
draw
you
from
the
circle
of
light
into
darkness
and
chaos
if
you
would
stand
firm
you
must
stand
within
the
whirlwind
if
you
would
maintain
the
of
your
soul
you
must
preserve
the
balance
of
movement
the
radiant
and
deathless
atoms
whereof
your
body
and
spirit
are
composed
must
be
under
steady
control
and
complete
organisation
like
a
well
disciplined
army
otherwise
the
disintegrating
forces
set
up
by
the
malign
influences
of
others
around
you
will
not
only
attack
your
happiness
but
your
health
break
down
your
strength
and
murder
your
peace
love
is
the
only
glory
of
life
the
heart
and
pulse
of
all
things
a
possession
denied
to
earth
greatest
conquerors
a
talisman
which
opens
all
the
secrets
of
nature
a
divinity
whose
power
is
limitless
and
whose
benediction
bestows
all
beauty
all
sweetness
all
joy
bear
this
in
mind
and
never
forget
how
such
a
gift
is
grudged
to
those
who
have
it
by
those
who
have
it
not
reading
thus
far
a
light
began
to
break
in
upon
me
had
not
all
the
weird
and
inexplicable
experience
of
the
past
hours
or
days
tended
to
shake
me
from
love
and
destroy
my
allegiance
to
the
ideal
i
cherished
and
had
i
yielded
to
the
temptation
had
i
failed
i
dared
not
estimate
either
failure
or
success
leaving
my
place
at
the
window
i
saw
that
the
little
or
dresser
in
the
wall
had
come
up
noiselessly
with
its
usual
daintily
prepared
refection
of
fruit
and
bread
and
deliciously
cool
spring
water
i
had
felt
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
during
my
strange
wanderings
in
unknown
places
but
now
i
was
quite
ready
for
a
meal
and
enjoyed
it
with
all
the
zest
of
an
unspoilt
appetite
when
i
had
finished
i
returned
to
my
precious
book
and
placing
it
on
the
table
i
propped
up
my
head
between
my
two
hands
and
set
myself
resolutely
to
study
and
i
write
down
here
the
passages
i
read
exactly
as
i
found
them
for
those
who
care
to
practise
the
lessons
they
teach
the
exercise
of
the
will
is
practically
limitless
it
is
left
unfettered
so
that
we
may
be
free
to
make
our
own
choice
of
life
and
evolve
our
own
destiny
it
can
command
all
things
save
love
for
love
is
of
god
and
god
is
not
subject
to
authority
love
must
be
born
in
the
soul
and
of
the
soul
it
must
be
a
dual
flame
that
is
to
say
it
must
find
its
counterpart
in
another
soul
which
is
its
ordained
mate
before
it
can
fulfil
its
highest
needs
then
like
two
wings
moved
by
the
same
soaring
impulse
it
assists
the
will
and
carries
it
to
the
highest
heaven
through
its
force
life
is
generated
and
preserved
without
it
life
escapes
to
other
phases
to
find
its
love
again
nothing
is
perfect
nothing
is
lasting
without
the
light
and
fire
of
this
dual
flame
it
can
not
be
willed
either
to
kindle
or
to
burn
it
must
be
born
of
itself
and
in
itself
and
shed
its
glory
on
the
souls
of
its
own
choice
all
else
is
subject
to
order
and
command
love
alone
is
free
power
power
over
all
things
and
all
men
is
obtained
by
organisation
that
is
to
say
one
house
in
order
the
implied
is
the
body
in
which
the
soul
has
temporary
dwelling
every
corner
of
it
must
be
order
every
atom
working
healthfully
in
its
place
without
any
suggestion
of
confusion
then
whatever
is
desired
shall
be
attained
nothing
in
the
universe
can
resist
the
force
of
a
steadfastly
fixed
resolve
what
the
spirit
truly
seeks
must
by
eternal
law
be
given
to
it
and
what
the
body
needs
for
the
fulfilment
of
the
spirit
commands
will
be
bestowed
from
the
sunlight
and
the
air
and
the
hidden
things
of
space
strength
shall
be
daily
and
hourly
renewed
everything
in
nature
shall
aid
in
bringing
to
the
resolved
soul
that
which
it
demands
there
is
nothing
within
the
circle
of
creation
that
can
resist
its
influence
success
wealth
triumph
upon
triumph
come
to
every
human
being
who
daily
his
house
in
order
whom
nothing
can
move
from
his
fixed
intent
whom
no
malice
can
shake
no
derision
drive
from
his
determined
goal
whom
no
temptation
can
drag
from
his
appointed
course
and
who
is
proof
against
spite
and
calumny
for
minds
are
for
the
most
part
like
the
shifting
sands
of
the
sea
and
he
alone
rules
who
evolves
order
from
chaos
eternal
life
life
is
eternal
because
it
can
not
die
everything
that
lives
must
live
for
ever
everything
that
lives
has
always
lived
what
is
called
death
is
by
law
impossible
life
is
perpetually
changing
into
various
forms
and
every
change
it
makes
we
call
because
to
us
it
seems
a
cessation
of
life
whereas
it
is
simply
renewed
activity
every
soul
imprisoned
in
human
form
has
lived
in
human
form
before
the
very
rose
that
flowers
on
its
stem
has
flowered
in
this
world
before
each
individual
spirit
preserves
its
individuality
and
to
a
certain
extent
its
memory
it
is
permitted
to
remember
a
few
out
of
the
million
incidents
and
episodes
with
which
its
psychic
brain
is
stored
but
only
a
few
during
its
period
of
evolvement
when
it
reaches
the
utmost
height
of
spiritual
capacity
and
is
strong
enough
to
know
and
see
and
understand
then
it
will
remember
all
from
the
beginning
nothing
can
ever
be
forgotten
inasmuch
as
forgetfulness
implies
waste
and
there
is
no
waste
in
the
scheme
of
the
universe
every
thought
is
kept
for
use
every
word
every
sigh
and
tear
is
recorded
life
itself
in
our
limited
view
of
it
can
be
continued
indefinitely
on
this
earth
if
we
use
the
means
given
to
us
to
preserve
and
renew
it
it
was
easy
to
preserve
and
prolong
it
in
the
early
days
of
the
prime
for
our
planet
was
then
nearer
to
the
sun
in
the
present
day
it
is
returning
to
a
position
in
the
heavens
which
encourages
and
sustains
life
and
men
live
longer
without
knowing
why
never
thinking
that
it
is
the
result
of
the
immediate
situation
of
the
planet
with
regard
to
the
sun
the
earth
is
not
where
it
was
in
the
days
of
christ
it
has
been
rushing
through
space
these
two
thousand
years
and
yet
mankind
forgets
that
its
place
in
the
heavens
is
different
from
that
which
it
formerly
occupied
and
that
with
this
difference
the
laws
of
climate
custom
and
living
are
changed
it
is
not
man
who
alters
his
surroundings
it
is
nature
whose
order
can
not
be
disobeyed
man
thinks
that
the
growth
of
science
and
what
he
calls
his
is
the
result
of
his
own
cleverness
alone
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
result
of
a
change
in
his
atmospheric
ether
which
not
only
helps
scientific
explanation
and
discovery
but
which
tends
to
give
him
greater
power
over
the
elements
as
well
as
to
prolong
his
life
and
intellectual
capability
there
is
no
such
thing
as
still
in
the
universe
every
atom
every
organism
is
doing
something
or
going
somewhere
and
there
is
no
stop
rest
itself
is
merely
a
form
of
progress
towards
beauty
and
perfection
and
there
is
no
flaw
anywhere
in
the
majestic
splendour
of
god
scheme
for
the
ultimate
happiness
of
his
entire
creation
arrogant
asceticism
the
ascetic
is
a
blasphemer
of
god
and
of
the
work
for
which
god
alone
is
responsible
by
withdrawing
himself
from
the
world
of
men
he
withdraws
himself
from
human
sympathy
by
chastising
the
body
and
its
natural
emotions
and
desires
he
chastises
that
which
god
has
made
as
a
temple
for
his
soul
to
dwell
in
by
denying
the
pleasures
of
this
world
he
denies
all
the
good
which
god
has
prepared
and
provided
for
him
and
he
wrongs
the
fair
happiness
of
nature
and
the
order
in
which
the
universe
is
planned
the
person
who
retires
into
a
monastery
there
to
pray
and
fast
and
bemoan
the
ills
of
the
flesh
is
an
unnatural
creature
and
displeasing
to
his
maker
for
god
looked
upon
everything
he
had
made
and
found
it
good
not
bad
as
the
arrogant
ascetic
would
assume
joy
not
sorrow
should
be
the
keynote
of
life
the
world
is
not
a
of
tears
but
a
garden
basking
in
the
perpetual
sunshine
of
the
smile
of
god
what
is
called
is
the
work
of
man
god
has
no
part
in
it
pride
the
angels
fell
by
pride
man
delays
his
eternal
delight
when
he
presumes
to
be
wiser
than
his
creator
when
he
endeavours
to
upset
the
organisation
of
nature
and
invents
a
kind
of
natural
and
moral
code
of
his
own
then
comes
disaster
the
rule
of
a
pure
and
happy
life
is
to
take
all
that
god
sends
with
thankfulness
in
moderation
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
joys
of
the
senses
the
love
of
one
the
delights
of
the
intellect
the
raptures
of
the
soul
and
to
find
no
fault
with
that
which
is
and
must
ever
be
faultless
we
hear
of
wise
men
and
philosophers
sorrowing
over
pain
and
suffering
of
the
world
but
the
pain
and
suffering
are
wrought
by
man
alone
and
cruelty
to
his
fellows
from
man
culpable
carelessness
and
neglect
of
the
laws
of
health
has
come
every
disease
as
from
man
egotism
unbelief
and
selfishness
have
sprung
all
the
crimes
in
the
calendar
i
paused
here
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
getting
dark
at
any
rate
i
could
not
see
to
read
very
clearly
i
looked
at
the
window
but
very
little
light
came
through
it
a
sudden
obscurity
like
a
heavy
cloud
darkened
all
visible
things
i
quickly
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
not
yield
to
any
more
fanciful
terrors
or
leave
the
room
even
if
i
saw
another
outlet
that
night
with
this
determination
i
undressed
quickly
and
went
to
bed
as
i
laid
my
head
on
the
pillow
i
felt
a
kind
of
coldness
in
the
air
which
made
me
shiver
a
little
an
sensation
to
which
i
would
not
yield
i
saw
the
darkness
thickening
round
me
and
closed
my
eyes
resolving
to
rest
and
so
succeeded
in
ordering
all
my
faculties
to
this
end
that
within
a
very
few
minutes
i
was
soundly
asleep
xix
the
unknown
deep
my
slumber
was
so
profound
and
dreamless
that
i
have
no
idea
how
long
it
lasted
but
when
finally
i
awoke
it
was
with
a
sense
of
the
most
vivid
and
appalling
terror
every
nerve
in
my
body
seemed
paralysed
i
could
not
move
or
cry
out
invisible
bands
stronger
than
iron
held
me
a
prisoner
on
my
bed
and
i
could
only
stare
upwards
in
horror
as
a
victim
bound
to
the
rack
might
stare
at
the
pitiless
faces
of
his
torturers
a
figure
tall
massive
and
clothed
in
black
stood
beside
me
i
could
not
see
its
face
but
i
felt
its
eyes
gazing
down
upon
me
with
a
remorseless
cold
inquisitiveness
a
silent
searching
enquiry
which
answered
itself
without
words
if
every
thought
in
my
brain
and
every
emotion
of
my
soul
could
have
been
cut
out
of
me
with
a
dissecting
knife
and
laid
bare
to
outward
inspection
those
terrible
eyes
probing
deep
into
the
very
innermost
recesses
of
my
being
would
have
done
the
work
the
beating
of
my
heart
sounded
loud
and
insistent
in
my
own
ears
i
lay
still
trying
to
gain
control
over
my
trembling
spirit
and
it
was
almost
with
an
awful
sense
of
relief
that
i
saw
the
figure
move
at
last
from
its
rigid
attitude
and
beckon
me
beckon
slowly
and
commandingly
with
one
outstretched
arm
from
which
the
black
dank
draperies
hung
like
drifting
cloud
mechanically
obeying
the
signal
i
strove
to
rise
from
my
bed
and
found
that
i
could
do
so
i
sat
up
shiveringly
looking
at
the
terrifying
form
that
towered
above
me
enclosing
me
as
it
were
in
its
own
shadow
and
then
managing
to
stand
on
my
feet
though
unsteadily
i
mutely
prepared
to
follow
where
it
should
lead
it
moved
on
and
i
went
after
it
compelled
by
some
overpowering
instinct
against
which
i
dared
not
rebel
once
the
vague
thought
flitted
through
my
brain
this
is
death
that
summons
me
away
till
with
the
thought
came
the
remembrance
that
according
to
the
schooling
i
was
receiving
there
is
no
such
thing
as
but
only
the
imaginary
phantom
we
call
by
that
name
slowly
sedately
and
with
an
indescribable
majesty
of
movement
the
dark
figure
glided
on
before
me
and
i
a
trembling
little
creature
followed
it
i
knew
not
whither
there
was
no
obstacle
in
our
course
doors
walls
and
windows
seemed
to
melt
asunder
into
nothingness
as
we
passed
and
there
was
no
stop
to
our
onward
progress
till
suddenly
i
saw
before
me
a
steep
and
narrow
spiral
stairway
of
stone
winding
up
into
the
very
centre
of
a
rocky
pinnacle
which
in
its
turn
lifted
its
topmost
peak
into
the
darkness
of
a
night
sky
sprinkled
with
millions
of
stars
the
sombre
figure
paused
and
again
i
felt
the
of
its
invisible
eyes
burning
through
me
then
as
though
satisfied
with
its
brief
survey
it
began
to
ascend
the
spiral
stair
i
followed
step
by
step
the
way
was
long
and
difficult
the
sharp
turns
dizzying
to
the
senses
and
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
upward
winding
sometimes
i
stumbled
and
nearly
fell
sometimes
i
groped
on
hands
and
knees
always
seeing
before
me
the
form
that
moved
on
with
such
apparently
little
care
as
to
whether
or
no
i
fared
ill
or
well
in
my
obedience
to
its
summons
and
now
as
i
climbed
all
sorts
of
strange
memories
began
to
creep
into
the
crannies
of
my
brain
and
perplex
me
with
trouble
and
uncertainty
chiefly
did
my
mind
dwell
on
cruelties
the
cruelties
practised
by
human
beings
to
one
another
moral
cruelties
especially
they
being
so
much
worse
than
any
physical
torture
i
thought
of
the
world
wicked
misjudgments
passed
on
those
who
are
greater
in
spirit
than
itself
how
even
when
we
endeavour
to
do
good
to
others
our
kindest
actions
are
often
represented
as
merely
so
many
forms
of
and
how
our
supposed
friends
often
wrong
us
and
listen
credulously
to
enviously
invented
tales
against
us
how
even
in
love
ah
that
most
etherial
yet
most
powerful
of
passions
a
rough
word
an
unmerited
slight
may
separate
for
a
lifetime
those
whose
love
would
otherwise
have
been
perfect
and
still
i
climbed
and
still
i
thought
and
still
the
dark
beckoned
me
on
and
on
and
then
i
began
to
consider
that
in
climbing
to
some
unknown
unseen
height
in
deep
darkness
i
was
after
all
doing
a
wiser
thing
than
living
in
the
world
with
the
ways
of
the
world
ways
that
are
for
the
most
part
purely
hypocritical
and
are
practised
merely
to
overreach
and
one
and
women
ways
of
fashion
ways
of
society
ways
of
government
which
are
merely
temporary
while
nature
the
invincible
and
eternal
moves
on
her
appointed
course
with
the
same
inborn
intuition
namely
to
destroy
that
which
is
evil
and
preserve
only
that
which
is
good
and
man
the
sole
maker
of
evil
the
only
opposer
of
divine
order
fools
himself
into
the
belief
that
his
evil
shall
prosper
and
his
falsehood
be
accepted
as
truth
if
he
can
only
sham
a
sufficient
show
of
religious
faith
to
deceive
himself
and
others
on
the
ascending
plane
of
history
he
who
has
invented
sin
has
likewise
invented
a
god
to
pardon
it
for
there
is
no
sin
in
the
natural
universe
the
divine
law
can
not
pardon
for
it
is
inviolate
and
bears
no
trespass
without
punishment
so
i
mused
in
my
inward
self
and
still
i
climbed
keeping
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
figure
that
led
me
on
and
which
now
having
reached
the
end
of
the
spiral
stair
was
slowly
mounting
to
the
highest
peak
of
the
rocky
pinnacle
which
lifted
itself
to
the
stars
an
icy
wind
began
to
blow
my
feet
were
bare
and
i
was
thinly
clad
in
my
with
only
the
addition
of
a
white
woollen
wrap
i
had
hastily
flung
round
me
for
warmth
when
i
left
my
bed
to
follow
my
spectral
leader
and
i
shivered
through
and
through
with
the
bitter
cold
yet
i
went
on
resolutely
indeed
having
started
on
this
perilous
adventure
there
was
no
returning
for
when
i
looked
back
on
the
way
i
had
come
the
spiral
stair
had
completely
vanished
and
there
was
nothing
but
black
and
empty
space
this
discovery
so
terrified
me
that
for
the
moment
i
lost
breath
and
i
came
to
a
halt
in
the
very
act
of
ascending
then
i
saw
the
figure
in
front
of
me
turn
round
with
a
threatening
movement
and
i
felt
that
with
one
second
more
of
hesitation
i
should
lose
my
footing
altogether
and
slip
away
into
some
vast
abysmal
depth
of
unimaginable
doom
making
a
strong
effort
i
caught
back
my
escaping
and
forced
my
shuddering
limbs
to
obey
my
will
and
resume
their
so
slowly
inch
by
inch
i
resumed
my
climb
sick
with
giddiness
and
fear
and
chilled
to
the
very
heart
presently
i
heard
a
rumbling
roar
like
the
sound
of
great
billows
rushing
into
hollow
caverns
which
echoed
their
breaking
in
thuds
of
booming
thunder
looking
up
i
saw
the
figure
i
had
followed
standing
still
and
i
fancied
that
the
sombre
draperies
in
which
it
was
enveloped
showed
an
outline
of
glimmering
light
fired
by
a
sudden
hope
i
set
myself
to
tread
the
difficult
path
anew
and
presently
i
too
stood
still
beside
my
mysterious
leader
above
me
was
a
heaven
of
stars
below
an
unfathomable
deep
of
darkness
where
nothing
was
visible
but
from
this
nothingness
arose
a
mighty
turbulence
as
of
an
angry
sea
i
remained
where
i
found
myself
afraid
to
move
one
false
step
might
i
felt
hurl
me
into
a
destruction
which
though
it
would
not
be
actual
death
would
certainly
be
something
like
chaos
almost
i
felt
inclined
to
catch
at
the
cloudy
garments
of
the
solemn
figure
at
my
side
for
safety
and
protection
and
while
this
desire
was
yet
upon
me
it
turned
its
veiled
head
towards
me
and
spoke
in
a
low
deep
tone
that
was
infinitely
gentle
so
far
and
yet
not
far
enough
it
said
to
what
end
wilt
thou
adventure
for
the
sake
of
love
to
no
end
whatsoever
i
answered
with
sudden
boldness
but
to
everlasting
continuance
again
i
thought
i
saw
a
faint
glowing
light
within
its
sombre
draperies
what
wouldst
thou
do
for
love
its
voice
again
enquired
wouldst
thou
bear
all
things
and
believe
all
things
canst
thou
listen
to
falsehood
bearing
witness
against
truth
and
yet
love
on
wilt
thou
endure
all
suffering
all
misunderstanding
all
coldness
and
cruelty
and
yet
keep
thy
soul
bright
as
a
burning
lamp
with
the
flame
of
faith
and
endeavour
wouldst
thou
scale
the
heavens
and
plunge
to
the
uttermost
hell
for
the
sake
of
him
thou
lovest
knowing
that
thy
love
must
make
him
one
with
thee
at
the
hour
i
looked
up
at
the
figure
vainly
striving
to
see
its
face
all
these
things
i
would
do
i
answered
all
that
is
in
the
power
of
my
soul
to
endure
mortally
or
immortally
i
will
bear
for
love
sake
again
the
light
flashed
through
its
black
garments
when
it
next
spoke
its
voice
rang
out
harshly
in
ominous
warning
thy
lover
is
dead
it
proclaimed
he
has
passed
from
this
sphere
to
another
and
ye
shall
not
meet
again
for
many
cycles
of
time
dost
thou
believe
it
a
cold
agony
gripped
my
breast
but
i
would
not
yield
to
it
and
answered
resolutely
no
i
do
not
believe
it
he
could
not
die
without
my
knowing
and
feeling
the
parting
of
his
soul
from
mine
there
was
a
pause
in
which
only
the
thunder
of
that
invisible
sea
far
down
below
us
was
audible
then
the
voice
went
on
thy
lover
is
false
it
said
his
love
for
thee
was
a
passing
mood
already
he
regrets
already
he
wearies
in
thought
of
thee
and
loves
thee
no
more
dost
thou
believe
it
i
took
no
time
for
thought
but
answered
at
once
without
hesitation
no
for
if
he
does
not
love
me
his
spirit
lies
and
no
spirit
can
lie
another
pause
then
the
voice
put
this
question
dost
thou
truly
believe
in
god
thy
creator
the
maker
of
heaven
and
earth
lifting
my
eyes
half
in
hope
half
in
appeal
to
the
starry
deep
sky
above
me
i
replied
fervently
i
do
believe
in
him
with
all
my
soul
a
silence
followed
which
seemed
long
and
weighted
with
suspense
then
the
voice
spoke
once
more
dost
thou
believe
in
love
the
generator
of
life
and
the
moving
cause
and
mind
of
all
created
things
and
again
i
replied
with
all
my
soul
the
figure
now
bent
slightly
towards
me
and
the
light
within
its
darkness
became
more
denned
and
brilliant
presently
an
arm
and
hand
white
and
radiant
a
shape
as
of
living
flame
was
slowly
outstretched
from
the
enfolding
black
draperies
it
pointed
steadily
to
the
abyss
below
me
if
thy
love
is
so
great
said
the
voice
if
thy
faith
is
so
strong
if
thy
trust
in
god
is
sure
and
perfect
descend
thither
i
heard
but
could
not
credit
my
own
hearing
i
gazed
at
the
shrouded
and
veiled
speaker
at
the
commanding
arm
that
signed
my
mortal
body
to
destruction
for
a
moment
i
was
lost
in
wild
terror
and
wilder
doubt
was
this
fearful
suggestion
a
temptation
or
a
test
should
it
be
obeyed
i
strove
to
find
the
of
my
own
self
to
gather
all
my
forces
together
to
make
myself
sure
of
my
own
will
and
responsible
for
my
own
deeds
and
then
then
i
paused
all
that
was
purely
mortal
in
me
shuddered
on
the
brink
of
the
unknown
one
look
upward
to
the
soft
gloom
of
the
purple
sky
and
its
myriad
stars
one
horrified
glance
downward
at
the
dark
depth
where
i
heard
the
roaring
of
the
sea
i
clasped
my
hands
in
a
kind
of
prayerful
desperation
and
looked
once
more
at
the
solemn
shadow
beside
me
if
thy
love
is
so
great
it
repeated
in
slow
and
impressive
tones
if
thy
faith
is
so
strong
if
thy
trust
in
god
is
so
sure
and
perfect
there
came
a
moment
of
tense
stillness
a
moment
in
which
my
life
seemed
detached
from
myself
so
that
i
held
it
like
a
palpitating
separate
creature
in
my
hands
suddenly
the
recollection
of
the
last
vision
of
all
those
i
had
seen
among
the
dark
mountains
of
coruisk
came
back
to
me
vividly
that
of
the
woman
who
had
knelt
outside
a
barred
gate
in
heaven
waiting
to
enter
in
o
leave
her
not
always
exiled
and
alone
i
had
prayed
then
dear
god
have
pity
unbar
the
gate
and
let
her
in
she
has
waited
so
long
a
sob
broke
unconsciously
from
my
lips
my
eyes
filled
with
burning
tears
that
blinded
me
imploringly
i
turned
towards
the
relentless
figure
beside
me
once
more
its
hand
still
pointed
downwards
and
again
i
seemed
to
hear
the
words
if
thy
love
is
so
great
if
thy
faith
is
so
strong
if
thy
trust
in
god
is
so
sure
and
perfect
and
then
i
suddenly
found
my
own
soul
centre
the
very
basis
of
my
own
actual
being
and
standing
firmly
upon
that
plane
of
imperishable
force
i
came
to
a
quick
resolve
nothing
can
destroy
me
i
said
within
myself
nothing
can
slay
the
immortal
part
of
me
and
nothing
can
separate
my
soul
from
the
soul
of
my
beloved
in
all
earth
in
all
heaven
there
is
no
cause
for
fear
hesitating
no
longer
i
closed
my
eyes
then
extending
my
clasped
hands
i
threw
myself
forward
and
plunged
into
the
darkness
down
down
interminably
down
a
light
followed
me
like
a
meteoric
shaft
of
luminance
piercing
the
blackness
i
retained
sufficient
consciousness
to
wonder
at
its
brilliancy
and
for
a
time
i
was
borne
along
in
my
descent
as
though
on
wings
down
still
down
and
i
saw
ocean
at
my
feet
a
heaving
mass
of
angry
waters
flecked
with
a
fleece
of
foam
the
change
that
is
called
death
but
which
is
life
this
was
the
only
clear
thought
that
flashed
like
lightning
through
my
brain
as
i
sank
swiftly
towards
the
engulfing
desert
of
the
sea
then
everything
swirled
into
darkness
and
silence
a
delicate
warm
glow
like
the
filtering
of
sunbeams
through
shaded
silk
and
crystal
a
fragrance
of
roses
a
delicious
sound
of
music
to
these
things
i
was
gradually
awakened
by
a
gentle
pressure
on
my
brows
i
looked
up
and
my
whole
heart
relieved
itself
in
a
long
deep
sigh
of
ecstasy
it
was
aselzion
himself
who
bent
over
me
aselzion
whose
grave
blue
eyes
watched
me
with
earnest
and
anxious
solicitude
i
smiled
up
at
him
in
response
to
his
wordless
questioning
as
to
how
i
felt
and
would
have
risen
but
that
he
imperatively
signed
to
me
to
lie
still
rest
he
said
and
his
voice
was
very
low
and
tender
rest
poor
child
you
have
done
more
than
well
another
sigh
of
pure
happiness
escaped
me
i
stretched
out
my
arms
lazily
like
one
aroused
from
a
long
and
refreshing
slumber
my
sensations
were
now
perfectly
exquisite
a
fresh
and
radiant
life
seemed
pouring
itself
through
my
veins
and
i
was
content
to
remain
a
perfectly
passive
recipient
of
such
an
inflow
of
health
and
joy
the
room
i
found
myself
in
was
new
to
me
it
seemed
made
up
of
lovely
colourings
and
a
profusion
of
sweet
flowers
i
lay
enshrined
as
it
were
in
the
centre
of
a
little
temple
of
beauty
i
had
no
desire
to
move
or
to
speak
every
trouble
every
difficulty
had
passed
from
my
mind
and
i
watched
aselzion
dreamily
as
he
brought
a
chair
to
the
side
of
my
couch
and
sat
down
then
taking
my
hand
in
his
felt
my
pulse
with
an
air
of
close
attention
i
smiled
again
does
it
still
beat
i
asked
finding
my
voice
suddenly
surely
the
great
sea
has
drowned
it
still
holding
my
hand
he
looked
full
into
my
eyes
waters
can
not
quench
love
he
quoted
softly
dear
child
you
have
proved
that
truth
be
satisfied
raising
myself
on
my
pillows
i
studied
his
grave
face
with
an
earnest
scrutiny
tell
me
i
half
whispered
have
i
failed
he
pressed
my
hand
encouragingly
no
you
have
almost
conquered
almost
only
i
sank
back
again
on
the
couch
wondering
and
waiting
he
remained
beside
me
quite
silent
after
a
little
the
tension
of
suspense
became
unbearable
and
i
spoke
again
how
did
i
escape
i
asked
who
saved
me
when
i
fell
he
smiled
gravely
there
was
nothing
to
escape
from
he
answered
and
no
one
saved
you
since
you
were
not
in
danger
not
in
danger
i
echoed
amazed
no
only
from
yourself
i
gazed
at
him
utterly
bewildered
he
gave
me
a
kind
and
reassuring
glance
have
patience
he
said
gently
all
shall
be
explained
to
you
in
good
time
meanwhile
this
apartment
is
yours
for
the
rest
of
your
stay
here
which
will
not
now
be
long
i
have
had
all
your
things
removed
from
the
probation
room
in
the
tower
so
that
you
will
no
more
be
troubled
by
its
scenic
transformations
here
he
smiled
again
i
will
leave
you
now
to
recover
from
the
terrors
through
which
you
have
passed
so
bravely
rest
and
refresh
yourself
thoroughly
for
you
have
nothing
more
to
fear
when
you
are
quite
ready
touch
this
and
he
pointed
to
a
bell
i
shall
hear
its
summons
and
will
come
to
you
at
once
before
i
could
say
a
word
to
detain
him
he
had
retired
and
i
was
left
alone
i
rose
from
my
couch
and
the
first
impression
i
had
was
that
of
a
singular
ease
and
lightness
a
sense
of
physical
strength
and
that
was
delightful
beyond
expression
the
loveliness
and
peace
of
the
room
in
which
i
was
enchanted
me
everything
my
eyes
rested
upon
suggested
beauty
the
windows
were
shaded
with
rose
silk
hangings
and
when
i
drew
these
aside
i
looked
out
on
a
marble
loggia
or
balcony
overhung
with
climbing
roses
this
in
its
turn
opened
on
an
exquisite
glimpse
of
garden
and
blue
sea
there
was
no
clock
anywhere
to
tell
me
the
time
of
day
but
the
sun
was
shining
and
i
imagined
it
must
be
afternoon
adjoining
this
luxurious
apartment
was
an
equally
luxurious
bathroom
furnished
with
every
conceivable
elegance
the
bath
itself
was
of
marble
and
the
water
bubbled
up
from
its
centre
like
a
natural
spring
sparkling
as
it
came
i
found
all
my
clothes
books
and
other
belongings
arranged
with
care
where
i
could
most
easily
get
at
them
and
to
my
joy
the
book
secret
of
life
which
i
thought
i
had
lost
on
my
last
perilous
adventure
lay
on
a
small
table
by
itself
like
a
treasure
set
apart
i
bathed
and
dressed
quickly
allowing
myself
no
time
to
think
upon
any
strange
or
perplexing
point
in
my
adventures
but
giving
myself
entirely
up
to
the
joy
of
the
new
and
ecstatic
life
which
thrilled
through
me
a
mirror
in
the
room
showed
me
my
own
face
happy
and
radiant
my
own
eyes
bright
and
smiling
no
care
seemed
to
have
left
a
trace
on
my
features
and
i
was
fully
conscious
of
a
perfect
strength
and
health
that
made
the
mere
act
of
breathing
a
pleasure
in
a
very
short
time
i
was
ready
to
receive
aselzion
and
i
touched
the
bell
he
had
indicated
as
a
signal
then
i
sat
down
by
the
window
and
looked
out
on
the
fair
prospect
before
me
how
glorious
was
the
world
i
thought
how
full
of
perfect
beauty
that
heavenly
blue
of
sky
and
sea
melting
into
one
the
tender
hues
of
the
clambering
roses
against
the
green
of
the
surrounding
foliage
the
lovely
light
that
filtered
through
the
air
like
powdered
gold
were
not
all
these
things
to
be
thankful
for
and
can
there
be
any
real
unhappiness
so
long
as
our
souls
are
in
tune
with
the
complete
harmony
of
creation
hearing
a
step
behind
me
i
rose
and
with
a
glad
smile
stretched
out
my
hands
to
aselzion
who
had
just
then
entered
he
took
them
in
his
own
and
pressed
them
lightly
then
drawing
a
chair
opposite
to
mine
he
sat
down
his
face
expressed
a
certain
gravity
and
his
voice
when
he
began
to
speak
was
low
and
gentle
i
have
much
to
tell
you
he
said
but
i
will
make
it
as
brief
as
i
can
you
came
here
to
pass
a
certain
psychic
ordeal
and
you
have
passed
it
successfully
all
but
the
last
phase
of
that
we
will
speak
presently
for
the
moment
you
are
under
the
impression
that
you
have
been
through
certain
episodes
of
a
more
or
less
perplexing
and
painful
nature
so
you
have
but
not
in
the
way
you
think
nothing
whatever
has
happened
to
you
save
in
your
own
mind
your
adventures
have
been
purely
mental
and
were
the
result
of
several
brains
working
on
yours
and
compelling
you
to
see
and
to
hear
what
they
chose
there
do
not
look
so
startled
for
i
had
risen
with
an
involuntary
exclamation
i
will
explain
everything
quite
clearly
and
you
will
soon
understand
he
paused
and
i
sat
down
again
by
the
window
wondering
and
waiting
in
this
world
he
went
on
slowly
it
is
not
climate
or
natural
surroundings
that
affect
man
so
much
as
the
influences
brought
to
bear
upon
him
by
his
human
beings
really
live
surrounded
by
the
waves
of
thought
flung
off
by
their
own
brains
and
the
brains
of
those
around
them
and
this
is
the
reason
why
if
they
are
not
strong
enough
to
find
a
they
are
influenced
by
ways
and
moods
of
thought
which
would
never
be
their
own
by
choice
and
if
a
mind
or
let
us
say
a
soul
can
resist
the
impressions
brought
to
bear
upon
it
by
other
forces
than
itself
if
it
can
stand
alone
clear
of
obstacle
in
the
light
of
the
divine
image
then
it
has
gained
a
mastership
over
all
things
but
the
attainment
of
such
a
position
is
difficult
enough
to
be
generally
impossible
influences
work
around
us
everywhere
men
and
women
with
great
aims
in
life
are
swept
away
from
their
intentions
by
the
indifference
or
discouragement
of
their
friends
brave
deeds
are
hindered
from
accomplishment
by
the
suggestion
of
fears
which
do
not
really
exist
and
the
daily
scattering
and
waste
of
psychic
force
and
powerful
mentality
by
disturbing
or
opposing
is
sufficient
to
make
the
world
a
perfect
paradise
were
it
used
to
that
end
he
waited
a
moment
then
bent
his
eyes
earnestly
upon
me
as
he
resumed
you
do
not
need
to
be
told
by
me
that
you
have
lived
on
this
earth
before
and
that
you
have
many
times
been
gently
yet
forcibly
drawn
into
connection
with
the
other
predestined
half
of
yourself
that
soul
of
love
which
blindly
seeking
you
have
often
rejected
when
found
not
of
yourself
have
you
rejected
it
but
simply
because
of
the
influences
around
you
to
which
you
have
yielded
now
in
this
further
phase
of
your
existence
you
have
been
given
another
chance
another
opportunity
it
is
quite
possible
that
had
you
not
come
to
me
you
would
have
lost
your
happiness
again
and
it
was
this
knowledge
which
made
me
receive
you
against
all
the
rules
of
our
order
when
i
saw
that
you
were
fairly
resolved
your
ordeal
would
have
been
longer
had
you
not
made
the
first
bold
advance
yourself
on
the
occasion
of
your
entrance
into
our
chapel
the
light
of
the
cross
and
star
drew
you
and
your
soul
obeyed
the
attraction
of
its
native
element
had
you
opposed
its
intention
by
doubts
and
fears
i
should
have
had
more
trouble
with
you
than
i
should
have
cared
to
undertake
but
you
made
the
first
step
yourself
with
a
rare
courage
the
rest
was
comparatively
easy
he
paused
again
and
again
went
on
i
have
already
said
that
you
are
under
the
impression
of
having
gone
through
certain
adventures
or
episodes
which
have
more
or
less
distressed
and
perplexed
you
these
things
have
had
no
existence
except
in
your
mind
when
i
took
you
up
to
your
room
in
the
turret
i
placed
you
under
my
influence
and
under
the
influence
of
four
other
brains
acting
in
conjunction
with
myself
we
took
entire
possession
of
your
mentality
and
made
it
as
far
as
possible
like
a
blank
slate
on
which
we
wrote
what
we
chose
the
test
was
to
see
whether
your
soul
which
is
the
actual
you
could
withstand
and
overcome
our
suggestions
at
first
hearing
this
sounds
as
if
we
had
played
a
trick
upon
you
for
our
own
entertainment
but
it
is
not
so
it
is
merely
an
application
of
the
most
powerful
lesson
in
life
namely
the
resistance
and
conquest
of
the
influences
of
others
which
are
the
most
disturbing
and
weakening
forces
we
have
to
contend
with
i
began
to
see
clearly
what
he
meant
me
to
understand
and
i
hung
upon
his
words
with
eager
attention
you
have
only
to
look
about
you
in
the
world
he
continued
to
realise
the
truth
of
what
i
say
every
day
you
may
meet
some
soul
whose
powers
of
accomplishment
might
be
superb
if
it
were
not
for
the
restricting
influences
to
which
it
allows
itself
to
succumb
how
often
do
you
not
come
upon
a
man
or
woman
of
brilliant
genius
who
is
nevertheless
rendered
incompetent
by
opposing
influences
and
who
therefore
lives
the
life
of
a
bird
in
a
cage
take
the
thousands
of
men
wrongly
mated
whose
very
wives
and
children
drag
them
down
and
kill
every
spark
of
ambition
and
accomplishment
within
them
take
the
thousands
of
women
persuaded
or
forced
into
unions
with
men
whose
low
estimate
of
woman
intellect
coarsens
and
degrades
her
to
a
level
from
which
it
is
almost
impossible
to
rise
this
is
the
curse
of
the
magnetic
currents
of
other
brains
which
set
our
own
awry
and
make
half
the
trouble
and
mischief
in
the
world
not
one
soul
in
a
hundred
thousand
has
force
or
courage
to
resist
them
the
man
accustomed
to
live
with
a
wife
who
without
doing
any
other
harm
simply
kills
his
genius
by
the
mere
fact
of
her
daily
contact
moods
and
methods
makes
no
effort
to
shake
himself
free
from
the
apathy
her
influence
causes
but
simply
sinks
passively
into
inaction
the
woman
bound
to
a
man
who
insists
on
considering
her
lower
than
himself
and
often
pulled
this
way
and
that
by
the
selfish
desires
or
aims
of
her
children
or
other
family
belongings
becomes
a
mere
domestic
drudge
or
machine
with
no
higher
aims
than
are
contained
in
the
general
ordering
of
household
business
love
the
miraculous
touchstone
which
turns
everything
to
gold
is
driven
out
of
the
circle
of
life
with
the
result
that
life
itself
grows
weary
of
its
present
phase
and
makes
haste
to
seek
another
more
congenial
hence
proceeds
what
we
call
age
and
death
i
was
about
to
interrupt
by
an
eager
question
but
he
silenced
me
by
a
gesture
your
position
he
went
on
from
a
psychic
standard
which
is
the
only
necessary
because
the
only
lasting
attitude
is
that
of
being
brought
into
connection
with
the
other
half
of
your
spiritual
and
immortal
ego
which
means
the
possession
of
perfect
love
and
with
it
perfect
life
and
because
this
is
so
great
a
gift
and
so
entirely
divine
influences
are
bound
to
offer
opposition
in
order
that
the
soul
may
make
its
choice
voluntarily
therefore
when
i
and
the
other
brains
acting
with
me
placed
you
under
our
power
we
impressed
you
with
all
that
most
readily
shakes
the
feminine
mind
doubt
jealousy
suspicion
and
all
the
wretched
terrors
these
wretched
emotions
engender
we
suggested
the
death
of
rafel
santoris
as
well
as
his
treachery
you
heard
as
you
thought
voices
behind
a
wall
but
there
were
no
voices
only
the
suggestion
of
voices
in
your
mind
you
saw
strange
phantoms
and
shadows
they
had
no
existence
except
in
so
far
as
we
made
them
exist
and
present
themselves
to
your
mental
vision
you
wandered
away
into
unknown
places
so
you
imagined
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
never
left
your
room
never
left
my
room
i
echoed
oh
that
can
not
be
it
can
be
because
it
is
he
answered
me
smiling
gravely
the
only
thing
in
your
experience
that
was
real
was
the
finding
of
the
book
secret
of
life
in
the
shrine
here
it
is
and
he
took
it
up
from
the
table
on
which
it
lay
and
if
you
had
turned
it
over
a
little
more
you
would
have
found
this
and
he
read
aloud
action
is
the
material
result
of
thought
suffering
is
the
result
of
thinking
into
pain
disease
the
result
of
thinking
into
weakness
every
emotion
is
the
result
of
wrong
or
right
thinking
with
one
exception
love
love
is
not
an
emotion
but
a
principle
and
as
the
generator
of
life
pervades
all
things
and
is
all
things
thought
working
within
this
principle
creates
the
things
of
beauty
and
lastingness
thought
working
outside
this
principle
equally
creates
the
things
of
terror
doubt
confusion
and
destruction
there
is
no
other
secret
of
life
no
other
elixir
of
youth
no
other
immortality
he
pronounced
the
last
words
with
gentle
and
impressive
emphasis
and
a
great
sweetness
and
calm
filled
my
mind
as
i
listened
i
or
i
should
say
we
for
four
of
my
brethren
were
deeply
interested
in
you
on
account
of
the
courage
you
had
shown
we
took
you
up
to
the
utmost
height
of
endurance
in
the
way
of
mental
terror
and
to
our
great
joy
found
your
soul
strong
enough
to
baffle
and
conquer
the
ultimate
suggestion
of
death
itself
you
held
firmly
to
the
truth
that
there
is
no
death
and
with
that
spiritual
certainty
risked
all
for
love
now
we
have
released
you
from
our
spells
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
kindness
as
he
looked
at
me
and
i
want
to
know
if
you
thoroughly
realise
the
importance
of
the
lesson
we
have
taught
i
met
his
enquiring
glance
fully
and
steadily
i
think
i
do
i
said
you
mean
that
i
must
stand
alone
alone
yet
not
alone
he
answered
and
his
fine
face
was
transfigured
into
light
with
its
intense
feeling
and
power
alone
with
love
which
is
to
say
alone
with
god
and
therefore
surrounded
by
all
lasting
and
revivifying
things
you
will
go
back
from
this
place
to
the
world
of
conventions
and
you
will
meet
a
million
influences
to
turn
you
from
your
chosen
way
opinion
criticism
ridicule
calumny
and
downright
misunderstanding
these
will
come
out
against
you
like
armed
foes
bristling
at
every
point
with
weapons
of
offence
if
you
tell
them
of
your
quest
of
life
and
youth
and
love
and
of
your
experience
here
they
will
cover
you
with
their
mockery
and
derision
if
you
were
to
breathe
a
word
of
the
love
between
you
and
rafel
santoris
a
thousand
efforts
would
be
instantly
made
to
separate
you
one
from
the
other
and
snatch
away
the
happiness
you
have
won
how
will
you
endure
these
trials
what
will
be
your
method
of
action
i
thought
a
moment
the
same
that
i
have
tried
to
practise
here
i
answered
i
shall
believe
nothing
of
ill
report
but
only
of
good
he
bent
his
eyes
upon
me
searchingly
remember
he
said
what
force
there
is
in
a
storm
of
opinion
the
fiercest
gale
that
ever
blew
down
strong
trees
and
made
havoc
of
dwellings
is
a
mere
whisper
compared
with
the
fury
of
human
minds
set
to
destroy
one
soul
think
of
the
petty
grudge
borne
by
the
loveless
against
love
the
spite
of
the
restless
and
unhappy
against
those
who
have
won
peace
all
this
you
will
have
to
bear
for
the
world
is
envious
and
even
a
friend
breaks
down
in
the
strength
of
friendship
when
thwarted
or
rendered
jealous
by
a
greater
and
more
resistless
power
i
sighed
a
little
i
have
few
friends
i
said
certainly
none
that
have
ever
thought
it
worth
while
to
know
my
inner
and
truest
self
most
of
them
are
glad
to
be
my
friends
if
i
go
their
way
but
if
i
choose
a
way
of
my
own
their
becomes
mere
quarrel
but
i
talk
of
choosing
a
way
how
can
i
choose
yet
you
say
my
ordeal
is
not
over
it
will
be
over
he
answered
and
i
have
every
hope
that
you
will
pass
through
it
unflinchingly
you
have
not
heard
from
santoris
the
question
gave
me
a
little
thrill
of
surprise
heard
from
him
no
i
replied
he
never
suggested
writing
to
me
aselzion
smiled
he
is
too
closely
in
touch
with
you
to
need
other
correspondence
he
said
but
be
satisfied
that
he
is
safe
and
well
no
misadventure
has
befallen
him
thank
god
i
murmured
and
if
if
he
loves
you
no
more
went
on
aselzion
if
he
has
made
an
of
selection
as
the
scientists
would
say
and
is
not
even
now
sure
of
his
predestined
helper
and
inspirer
whose
love
will
lift
him
to
the
highest
attainment
what
then
what
then
why
i
must
submit
i
answered
slowly
i
can
wait
even
for
another
thousand
years
there
was
a
silence
during
which
i
felt
aselzion
eyes
upon
me
then
he
spoke
again
in
a
lighter
tone
let
us
for
the
moment
talk
of
what
the
world
calls
he
said
i
believe
you
are
just
now
conscious
of
perfect
health
and
of
a
certain
joy
in
the
mere
fact
of
life
is
it
not
so
smiling
i
bent
my
head
in
acquiescence
understand
then
he
continued
that
while
you
control
the
of
which
you
are
made
by
the
power
of
an
spirit
this
perfect
health
this
certain
joy
will
continue
and
more
than
this
everything
in
nature
will
serve
you
to
this
end
you
have
but
to
ask
your
servants
and
they
will
obey
ask
of
the
sun
its
warmth
and
radiance
it
will
answer
with
a
quick
bestowal
ask
of
the
storm
and
wind
and
rain
their
powers
of
passion
they
will
give
you
their
all
ask
of
the
rose
its
fragrance
and
colour
and
the
very
essence
of
it
shall
steal
into
your
blood
there
is
nothing
you
shall
seek
that
you
will
not
find
try
your
own
powers
now
and
with
the
word
he
got
up
and
opened
the
window
a
little
wider
then
signed
to
me
to
step
out
on
the
balcony
here
are
roses
climbing
up
on
their
appointed
way
bend
them
you
by
a
single
effort
of
the
will
i
gazed
at
him
in
complete
surprise
and
bewilderment
his
answering
looks
were
imperative
by
a
single
effort
of
the
will
he
repeated
i
obeyed
him
raising
my
eyes
to
the
roses
where
they
clambered
upwards
round
the
loggia
i
inwardly
commanded
them
to
turn
towards
me
the
effect
was
instantaneous
as
though
blown
by
a
light
breeze
they
all
bent
down
with
their
burden
of
bright
blossom
some
of
the
flowers
touching
my
hands
that
would
be
called
by
the
ignorant
said
aselzion
and
it
is
nothing
more
than
the
physical
force
of
the
magnetic
within
you
which
being
focused
in
a
single
effort
draw
the
roses
down
pliantly
to
your
will
no
more
miracle
is
there
in
this
than
that
of
the
common
magnet
which
has
been
vainly
trying
to
teach
us
lessons
about
ourselves
these
many
years
now
relax
your
will
again
i
obeyed
and
the
roses
moved
gently
away
and
upward
to
their
former
branching
height
this
is
an
object
lesson
for
you
said
aselzion
smiling
then
you
must
understand
that
you
are
now
in
a
position
to
draw
everything
to
you
as
easily
as
you
drew
those
roses
you
can
draw
the
germs
of
health
and
life
to
mix
and
mingle
with
your
blood
or
you
can
equally
draw
the
germs
of
disease
and
disintegration
the
action
is
with
you
from
the
sun
you
can
draw
fresh
fuel
for
your
brain
and
nerves
from
the
air
the
sustenance
you
demand
from
beautiful
things
their
beauty
from
wise
things
their
learning
from
powerful
things
their
force
nothing
can
resist
the
radiating
energy
you
possess
if
you
only
remember
how
to
employ
it
in
every
action
it
must
be
focused
on
the
given
point
it
must
not
be
disturbed
or
scattered
the
more
often
it
is
used
the
more
powerful
it
becomes
the
more
but
never
forget
that
it
must
work
within
the
creative
principle
of
love
not
outside
it
i
sat
absorbed
and
half
afraid
and
i
said
softly
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
stood
up
to
his
full
superb
stature
looking
down
upon
me
with
a
certain
mingling
of
kindness
and
pity
he
replied
we
shall
send
for
you
you
will
confront
the
brethren
as
one
who
has
passed
the
same
mental
test
through
which
they
are
passing
and
you
will
face
the
last
fear
i
do
not
think
you
will
go
back
upon
yourself
i
hope
not
i
strongly
desire
you
to
keep
your
courage
to
the
end
i
ventured
to
touch
his
hand
and
afterwards
i
queried
he
smiled
afterwards
life
and
its
secrets
are
all
with
you
and
love
xx
into
the
light
when
i
was
left
alone
once
more
i
gave
myself
up
to
the
enchanting
sense
of
perfect
happiness
that
now
seemed
to
possess
my
whole
being
the
world
of
glorious
nature
showed
me
an
aspect
of
brilliancy
and
beauty
that
could
no
more
be
shadowed
by
fear
or
foreboding
it
was
a
mirror
in
which
i
saw
reflected
the
perfect
mind
of
the
divine
nothing
existed
to
terrify
or
daunt
the
advancing
soul
which
had
become
cognisant
of
its
own
capabilities
and
which
by
the
very
laws
governing
it
is
preordained
to
rise
to
the
utmost
height
of
supernal
power
i
had
dimly
guessed
this
truth
but
i
had
never
surely
known
it
till
now
now
i
recognised
that
everything
is
and
must
be
subservient
to
this
interior
force
which
exists
to
the
earth
and
subdue
it
and
that
nothing
can
hinder
the
accomplishment
of
its
resolved
will
as
i
sat
by
the
window
thinking
and
dreaming
i
began
to
wonder
what
would
be
the
nature
of
that
fear
of
which
aselzion
had
spoken
why
should
the
word
be
mentioned
when
there
was
no
cause
for
fear
of
any
kind
fear
can
only
arise
from
a
sense
of
cowardice
and
cowardice
is
the
offspring
of
weakness
from
this
argument
it
followed
that
my
strength
was
not
yet
thoroughly
tested
to
aselzion
satisfaction
that
he
still
thought
it
possible
that
some
latent
weakness
in
my
spirit
might
display
itself
on
further
trial
and
i
resolved
that
if
such
was
his
idea
he
should
be
proved
wrong
nothing
i
vowed
should
move
me
now
not
all
the
world
arrayed
in
arms
against
me
should
hinder
my
advance
towards
the
completion
of
myself
in
the
love
of
my
beloved
i
have
already
said
that
there
was
no
visible
chronicle
of
time
in
the
house
of
aselzion
save
such
as
was
evidenced
by
the
broadening
or
waning
light
of
day
just
now
i
knew
it
was
late
afternoon
as
the
window
where
i
sat
faced
the
west
and
the
sun
was
sinking
in
a
blaze
of
glory
immediately
opposite
to
me
bars
of
gold
and
purple
and
pale
blue
formed
a
kind
of
cloud
gateway
across
the
heavens
and
behind
this
the
splendid
orb
shone
in
a
halo
of
deep
rose
watching
the
royal
pageantry
of
colour
on
all
sides
i
allowed
myself
to
go
forth
as
it
were
in
spirit
to
meet
and
absorb
it
inwardly
i
set
my
whole
being
in
tune
with
the
great
wave
of
light
which
opened
itself
over
the
sea
and
land
and
as
i
did
so
found
every
nerve
in
my
body
thrilled
with
responsive
ecstasy
even
as
harpstrings
may
be
thrilled
into
sound
by
the
sweep
of
the
wind
i
rose
and
went
out
through
the
loggia
into
the
garden
feeling
more
like
a
disembodied
spirit
than
a
mortal
so
light
and
free
and
joyous
were
my
very
movements
so
entirely
in
unison
was
i
with
everything
in
nature
the
sunset
bathed
me
in
its
ruby
and
purple
magnificence
i
lifted
my
eyes
to
the
heavens
and
murmured
almost
unconsciously
thank
god
for
life
thank
god
for
love
thank
god
for
all
that
life
and
love
must
bring
to
me
a
soaring
inland
flew
over
my
head
with
a
little
cry
its
graceful
poise
reminded
me
of
the
days
i
had
passed
in
morton
yacht
when
i
had
watched
so
many
of
these
creatures
dipping
into
the
waves
and
soaring
up
again
to
the
skies
and
on
a
sudden
impulse
i
stretched
out
my
hand
determining
to
stay
the
bird
flight
if
i
could
and
bring
it
down
to
me
the
effort
succeeded
slowly
and
as
if
checked
by
some
obstacle
it
felt
but
could
not
see
the
lovely
winged
thing
swept
round
and
round
in
an
ever
descending
circle
and
finally
alighted
on
my
wrist
i
held
it
so
for
a
moment
it
turned
its
head
towards
me
its
eyes
sparkling
in
the
sun
then
i
tossed
it
off
again
into
the
air
of
its
own
freedom
where
after
another
circling
sweep
or
two
it
disappeared
and
i
walked
on
in
a
happy
reverie
realising
that
what
i
could
do
with
the
visible
things
of
nature
i
could
do
as
easily
with
the
invisible
a
sense
of
power
vibrated
through
me
footnote
the
philosophy
of
plato
teaches
that
man
originally
by
the
power
of
the
divine
image
within
him
could
control
all
nature
but
gradually
lost
this
power
through
his
own
fault
power
to
command
and
power
to
resist
power
that
forbade
all
hesitation
vacillation
or
uncertainty
power
which
being
connected
by
both
physical
and
spiritual
currents
with
this
planet
the
earth
and
the
atmosphere
by
which
it
is
surrounded
lifts
all
that
it
desires
towards
itself
as
it
rejects
what
it
does
not
need
returning
slowly
through
the
garden
and
lingering
by
the
beds
of
flowers
that
adorned
it
i
noticed
how
when
i
bent
over
any
particular
blossom
it
raised
itself
towards
me
as
though
drawn
upward
by
a
magnet
i
was
not
inclined
to
gather
a
single
one
for
my
own
pleasure
some
occult
sympathy
had
become
established
between
me
and
these
beautiful
creations
and
i
could
no
more
sever
a
rose
from
its
stem
than
i
could
kill
a
bird
that
sang
its
little
song
to
me
on
my
room
i
found
the
usual
refection
prepared
for
me
fresh
fruit
and
bread
and
water
the
only
kind
of
food
i
was
allowed
it
was
quite
sufficient
for
me
in
fact
i
had
not
felt
at
any
time
the
sensation
of
hunger
i
began
to
wonder
how
long
i
had
been
a
in
the
house
of
aselzion
days
or
weeks
i
could
not
tell
i
was
realising
the
full
truth
that
with
the
things
of
the
infinite
time
has
no
existence
and
i
recalled
the
verse
of
the
ancient
psalm
a
thousand
ages
in
thy
sight
are
like
an
evening
gone
short
as
the
watch
that
ends
the
night
before
the
rising
sun
and
while
my
thoughts
ran
in
this
groove
i
opened
the
book
of
the
of
life
and
as
if
in
answer
to
my
inward
communing
found
the
following
the
delusion
of
time
time
has
no
existence
outside
this
planet
humanity
counts
its
seasons
its
days
and
hours
by
the
sun
but
beyond
the
sun
there
are
millions
and
trillions
of
other
and
larger
suns
compared
with
which
our
guiding
orb
is
but
a
small
star
out
in
the
infinitude
of
space
there
is
no
time
but
only
eternity
therefore
the
soul
which
knows
itself
to
be
eternal
should
associate
itself
with
eternal
things
and
should
never
count
its
existence
by
years
to
its
being
there
can
be
no
end
therefore
it
never
ages
and
never
dies
it
is
only
the
sham
religionists
who
talk
of
death
it
is
only
the
inefficient
and
unspiritual
who
talk
of
age
the
man
who
allows
himself
to
sink
into
feebleness
and
apathy
merely
because
of
the
passing
of
years
has
some
mental
or
spiritual
weakness
in
him
which
he
has
not
the
will
to
overcome
the
woman
who
suffers
her
beauty
and
freshness
to
wane
and
fade
on
account
of
what
she
or
her
friends
are
pleased
to
call
shows
that
she
is
destitute
of
spiritual
the
soul
is
always
young
and
its
own
radiation
can
preserve
the
youth
of
the
body
in
which
it
dwells
age
and
decrepitude
come
to
those
with
whom
the
soul
is
unknown
quantity
the
soul
is
the
only
barrier
against
the
forces
of
disintegration
which
break
down
effete
substances
in
preparation
for
the
change
which
humanity
calls
if
the
barrier
is
not
strong
enough
the
enemy
takes
the
city
these
facts
are
simple
and
true
too
simple
and
too
true
to
be
accepted
by
the
world
the
world
goes
to
church
and
asks
a
divinity
to
save
its
soul
practically
showing
in
all
its
ways
of
society
and
government
an
utter
disbelief
in
the
soul
existence
men
and
women
die
when
they
might
as
well
have
lived
if
we
examine
into
the
cause
of
their
deaths
we
shall
find
it
in
the
manner
of
their
lives
obstinacy
and
selfishness
have
murdered
more
human
beings
than
any
other
form
of
plague
the
blasphemy
of
sham
religion
has
insulted
the
majesty
of
the
creator
more
than
any
other
form
of
sin
and
he
has
answered
it
by
his
supreme
silence
the
man
who
attends
a
ritual
of
prayer
which
he
does
not
honestly
believe
in
merely
for
the
sake
of
social
custom
and
observance
is
openly
deriding
his
maker
and
the
priests
who
gain
their
living
out
of
such
ritual
are
trading
on
the
divine
let
the
people
of
this
earth
be
taught
that
they
live
not
in
time
but
eternity
that
their
thoughts
words
and
deeds
are
recorded
minutely
and
accurately
and
that
each
individual
human
unit
is
expected
to
contribute
towards
the
general
beauty
and
adornment
of
god
scheme
of
perfection
every
man
every
woman
must
give
of
his
or
her
best
the
artist
must
give
his
noblest
art
not
for
what
it
brings
to
him
personally
of
gain
or
renown
but
for
what
it
does
to
others
in
the
way
of
uplifting
the
poet
must
give
his
highest
thought
not
for
praise
but
for
love
the
very
craftsman
must
do
his
best
and
strongest
work
not
for
the
coin
paid
but
for
the
fact
that
it
is
work
and
as
such
must
be
done
well
and
none
must
imagine
that
they
can
waste
the
forces
wherewith
they
have
been
endowed
for
no
waste
and
no
indolence
is
permitted
and
in
the
end
no
selfishness
the
attitude
of
the
selfish
human
being
is
pure
disintegration
a
destroying
microbe
which
crumbles
and
breaks
down
the
whole
constitution
not
only
ruining
the
body
but
the
mind
and
frequently
making
havoc
of
the
very
wealth
that
has
been
too
selfishly
guarded
for
wealth
is
ephemeral
as
fame
only
love
and
the
soul
are
the
lasting
things
of
god
the
makers
of
life
and
the
rulers
of
eternity
so
far
i
read
then
laying
down
my
book
i
listened
music
solemn
and
exquisitely
beautiful
stole
on
my
ears
from
the
far
distance
it
seemed
to
float
through
the
open
window
as
though
in
a
double
chorus
rising
from
the
sea
and
falling
from
the
heavens
delicious
harmonies
trembled
through
the
air
soft
as
fine
rain
falling
on
roses
and
with
their
penetrating
tenderness
a
thousand
suggestions
a
thousand
memories
came
to
me
all
infinitely
sweet
i
began
to
think
that
even
if
rafel
santoris
were
separated
from
me
by
some
mischance
or
changed
to
me
in
any
way
it
need
not
affect
me
so
long
as
i
cherished
the
love
i
had
for
him
in
my
own
soul
our
passion
was
of
a
higher
quality
than
the
merely
material
it
was
material
and
spiritual
together
the
spiritual
predominating
thus
making
of
it
the
only
passion
that
can
last
what
difference
could
a
few
years
more
or
less
bring
if
we
were
bound
by
the
eternal
laws
governing
us
to
become
united
in
the
end
the
joy
of
life
is
to
love
rather
than
to
be
loved
and
the
recipient
of
love
is
never
so
fully
conscious
of
perfect
happiness
as
the
giver
the
music
went
on
in
varying
moods
of
lovely
harmony
and
my
mind
like
a
floating
cloud
drifted
lazily
above
the
waves
of
sound
i
thought
compassionately
of
the
unrest
and
discontent
of
thousands
who
devote
themselves
to
the
smallest
and
narrowest
aims
in
life
people
with
whom
the
loss
of
a
mere
article
of
wearing
apparel
is
more
important
than
a
national
difficulty
people
who
devote
all
their
faculties
to
social
schemes
of
people
who
discuss
trifles
till
discussion
is
worn
threadbare
and
ears
are
tired
and
brain
is
weary
people
who
assuming
to
be
religious
and
regular
yet
do
the
meanest
things
and
have
no
scruple
in
playing
the
part
of
and
setting
themselves
deliberately
to
break
friendships
and
destroy
love
people
who
talk
of
god
as
though
he
were
their
intimate
and
who
have
by
their
very
lives
drawn
everything
of
god
out
of
them
i
thought
of
all
these
i
say
and
i
thought
how
different
this
world
would
be
if
men
would
hold
by
the
noblest
ideals
and
suffer
the
latent
greatness
in
them
to
have
its
way
if
they
would
truly
rule
their
own
universe
and
not
allow
its
movements
to
fall
into
chaos
how
fair
life
would
become
how
replete
with
health
and
joy
what
a
paradise
would
be
created
around
us
and
what
constant
benediction
we
should
draw
down
upon
us
from
the
most
high
and
gradually
as
i
sat
absorbed
in
my
own
reveries
the
afternoon
waned
into
twilight
and
twilight
into
dusk
one
star
brilliant
as
a
great
diamond
flashed
out
suddenly
above
a
rift
of
cloud
and
a
soft
darkness
began
to
creep
stealthily
over
sky
and
sea
i
moved
away
from
the
window
and
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
room
waiting
and
wondering
the
music
still
continued
but
it
had
now
grown
slower
and
more
solemn
and
founded
like
a
great
organ
being
played
in
a
cathedral
it
impressed
me
with
a
sense
of
prayer
and
praise
more
of
praise
than
prayer
for
i
had
nothing
to
pray
for
god
having
given
me
my
own
soul
which
was
all
as
the
darkness
deepened
a
soft
suffused
light
illumined
the
room
and
i
now
noticed
that
it
was
the
surface
of
the
walls
that
shone
in
this
delicate
yet
luminous
way
i
put
my
hand
on
the
wall
nearest
to
me
it
was
quite
cold
to
the
touch
yet
bright
to
the
eyes
and
was
no
more
fatiguing
to
look
at
than
the
sunshine
on
a
landscape
i
could
not
understand
how
the
light
was
thus
arranged
and
used
but
its
effect
was
beautiful
as
i
walked
to
and
fro
looking
at
the
various
graceful
and
artistic
objects
which
adorned
the
room
i
perceived
an
easel
on
which
a
picture
was
placed
with
a
curtain
of
dark
velvet
drawn
across
it
moved
by
curiosity
i
drew
the
curtain
aside
and
my
heart
gave
a
quick
bound
of
delight
it
was
an
admirably
painted
portrait
of
rafel
santoris
the
grave
blue
eyes
looked
into
my
own
a
smile
rested
on
the
firm
handsome
mouth
the
whole
picture
spoke
to
me
and
seemed
to
ask
didst
thou
doubt
i
stood
gazing
at
it
for
several
minutes
enrapt
realising
how
much
even
the
of
a
beloved
face
may
mean
and
then
i
began
to
think
how
strange
it
is
that
we
never
seem
ready
to
admit
the
strong
insistence
of
nature
on
individuality
and
personality
up
at
a
vast
height
above
the
earth
and
looking
down
upon
a
crowd
of
people
from
the
car
of
a
balloon
or
from
an
aeroplane
all
human
beings
look
the
same
just
one
black
mass
of
tiny
moving
units
but
in
descending
among
them
we
find
every
face
and
figure
wholly
different
and
though
all
are
made
on
the
same
model
there
are
no
two
alike
yet
there
are
many
who
argue
and
maintain
that
though
individual
personality
in
bodies
may
be
strongly
marked
there
is
no
individual
personality
in
souls
ergo
that
nature
thinks
so
little
of
the
intelligent
spirit
inhabiting
a
mortal
form
that
she
limits
individuality
to
that
which
is
subject
to
change
and
has
no
care
for
it
in
that
which
is
eternal
such
an
hypothesis
is
absurd
on
the
face
of
it
since
it
is
the
soul
that
gives
individuality
to
the
body
the
individual
personality
of
rafel
santoris
expressed
even
in
his
painted
portrait
appealed
to
me
as
being
that
of
one
i
had
loved
long
and
tenderly
there
was
no
strangeness
in
his
features
but
only
an
adorable
familiarity
long
long
ago
in
centuries
that
had
proved
like
mere
days
down
the
vista
of
time
the
soul
in
those
blue
eyes
had
looked
love
into
mine
i
recognised
their
tender
gaze
i
knew
the
little
fleeting
wistful
smile
which
said
so
little
and
yet
so
much
i
felt
that
the
striving
ambitious
spirit
of
this
man
had
sought
mine
as
the
help
and
completion
of
his
own
uplifting
and
that
i
had
misunderstood
him
and
turned
from
him
at
the
crucial
moment
when
all
might
have
been
well
and
i
studied
his
picture
long
and
earnestly
so
moved
by
its
aspect
that
i
found
myself
talking
to
it
softly
as
though
it
were
a
living
thing
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
meet
you
again
i
murmured
will
you
come
to
me
or
shall
i
go
to
you
how
shall
we
find
each
other
when
shall
i
be
able
to
tell
you
that
i
know
you
now
to
be
the
only
beloved
the
one
centre
of
my
life
round
which
all
other
things
must
for
evermore
revolve
the
very
mainspring
of
my
best
thought
and
action
the
god
of
my
universe
from
whose
love
and
pleasure
spring
the
light
and
splendour
of
creation
when
shall
i
see
you
again
to
tell
you
all
that
my
heart
longs
to
express
when
may
i
fold
myself
in
your
arms
as
a
bird
folds
its
wings
in
a
nest
and
be
at
peace
knowing
that
i
have
gained
the
summit
of
all
ambition
and
desires
in
love
perfect
union
when
shall
we
attune
our
lives
together
in
that
harmonious
chord
which
shall
sound
its
music
sweetly
through
eternity
when
shall
our
souls
make
a
radiant
one
through
which
god
power
and
benediction
shall
vibrate
like
living
fire
creating
within
us
all
beauty
all
wisdom
all
courage
all
supernal
joy
for
this
is
bound
to
be
our
future
but
when
moved
by
my
own
imagining
i
stretched
out
my
arms
to
the
picture
of
my
love
and
tears
filled
my
eyes
i
was
nothing
but
the
weakest
of
mortals
in
the
sudden
recollection
of
the
happiness
i
might
have
won
long
ago
had
i
been
wise
in
time
a
door
opened
quietly
behind
me
and
i
turned
round
quickly
messenger
honorius
stood
before
me
and
i
greeted
him
with
a
smile
though
my
eyes
were
wet
have
you
come
to
fetch
me
i
asked
i
am
ready
he
inclined
his
head
a
little
you
are
not
quite
ready
he
said
and
with
the
word
he
gave
into
my
hands
a
folded
garment
and
veil
you
must
attire
yourself
in
these
i
will
wait
for
you
outside
he
retired
and
left
me
and
i
quickly
changed
my
own
things
for
those
which
had
been
brought
they
were
easily
put
on
as
they
consisted
simply
of
one
long
white
robe
of
a
rather
heavy
make
of
soft
silk
and
a
white
veil
which
covered
me
from
head
to
foot
my
attiring
took
me
but
a
few
minutes
and
when
all
was
done
i
touched
the
bell
by
which
i
had
previously
summoned
aselzion
honorius
entered
at
once
his
looks
were
grave
and
preoccupied
if
you
should
not
return
to
this
room
he
said
slowly
is
there
any
message
any
communication
you
would
like
me
to
convey
to
your
friends
my
heart
gave
a
quick
bound
there
was
some
actual
danger
in
store
for
me
then
i
thought
for
a
moment
then
smiled
none
i
answered
i
shall
be
able
to
attend
to
all
such
personal
matters
myself
afterwards
honorius
looked
at
me
and
his
handsome
but
rather
stern
face
was
grave
even
to
melancholy
do
not
be
too
sure
he
said
in
a
low
tone
it
is
not
my
place
to
speak
but
few
pass
the
ordeal
to
which
you
are
about
to
be
subjected
only
two
have
passed
it
in
ten
years
and
one
of
these
two
was
for
answer
he
pointed
to
the
portrait
of
santoris
thus
confirming
my
instinctive
hope
and
confidence
i
am
not
afraid
i
said
and
i
am
ready
to
follow
you
now
wherever
you
wish
me
to
go
he
made
no
further
remark
and
turning
round
led
the
way
out
of
the
apartment
we
went
down
many
stairs
and
through
many
corridors
some
dimly
lit
some
scarcely
illumined
at
all
the
night
had
now
fully
come
and
through
one
of
two
of
the
windows
we
passed
i
could
see
the
dark
sky
patterned
with
stars
we
came
to
the
domed
hall
where
the
fountain
played
and
this
was
illumined
by
the
same
strange
light
i
had
previously
noticed
the
lovely
radiance
played
on
the
spray
of
the
fountain
making
the
delicate
frondage
of
ferns
and
palms
and
the
hues
of
flowers
look
like
a
dream
of
fairyland
passing
through
the
hall
i
followed
my
guide
down
a
dark
narrow
passage
then
i
found
myself
suddenly
alone
guided
by
the
surging
sound
of
organ
music
i
went
on
and
all
at
once
saw
a
broad
stream
of
light
pouring
out
from
the
open
door
of
the
chapel
without
a
moment
hesitation
i
entered
then
paused
the
symbol
of
the
cross
and
star
flamed
opposite
to
me
and
on
every
side
wherever
i
looked
there
were
men
in
white
robes
with
cowls
thrown
back
on
their
shoulders
all
standing
in
silent
rows
watching
me
as
i
came
my
heart
beat
quickly
my
nerves
thrilled
i
trembled
as
i
walked
thankful
for
the
veil
that
partially
protected
me
from
that
multitude
of
eyes
eyes
that
looked
at
me
in
wonder
but
not
unkindly
eyes
that
mutely
asked
questions
never
to
be
answered
eyes
that
said
as
plainly
as
though
in
actual
speech
why
are
you
among
us
you
a
woman
why
should
you
have
conquered
difficulties
which
we
have
still
to
overcome
is
it
pride
defiance
or
ambition
with
you
or
is
it
all
love
i
felt
a
thousand
influences
moving
around
me
the
power
of
many
brains
at
work
silently
my
inner
spirit
as
though
it
were
a
witness
in
defence
of
some
great
argument
but
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
yield
to
the
overpowering
nervousness
and
sudden
alarm
of
my
own
position
which
threatened
to
shake
my
i
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
glittering
symbol
of
the
cross
and
star
and
moved
on
slowly
i
must
have
looked
a
strangely
solitary
creature
draped
in
white
like
a
victim
for
sacrifice
and
walking
all
alone
towards
those
burning
darting
rays
of
light
which
enveloped
the
whole
of
the
chapel
in
a
flood
of
almost
blinding
splendour
the
music
still
thundered
on
round
me
and
i
thought
i
heard
voices
far
off
singing
i
could
distinguish
words
that
came
falling
through
the
music
like
blossoms
falling
through
rain
into
the
light
into
the
heart
of
the
fire
to
the
innermost
core
of
the
deathless
flame
i
ascend
i
aspire
under
me
rolls
the
whirling
earth
with
the
noise
of
a
myriad
wheels
that
run
ever
round
and
about
the
sun
over
me
circles
the
splendid
heaven
strewn
with
the
stars
of
morn
and
even
and
i
the
queen
of
my
soul
serene
float
with
my
rainbow
wings
unfurled
alone
with
love
god
and
the
world
my
heart
beat
rapidly
every
nerve
in
me
trembled
yet
i
went
on
resolvedly
not
allowing
myself
to
even
think
of
danger
and
then
i
saw
aselzion
aselzion
transfigured
into
an
almost
supernatural
beauty
of
aspect
by
the
radiance
which
bathed
him
in
its
lustrous
glory
aselzion
with
outstretched
hands
beckoning
me
towards
him
and
as
i
approached
i
instinctively
sank
on
my
knees
the
music
died
away
suddenly
and
there
was
a
profound
silence
i
felt
though
i
could
not
see
that
the
eyes
of
all
present
were
fixed
upon
me
and
aselzion
spoke
rise
he
said
and
his
voice
was
clear
and
imperative
not
here
must
thou
kneel
not
here
must
thou
rest
rise
and
go
onward
thou
hast
gone
far
but
the
way
is
still
beyond
the
gate
of
the
last
probation
stands
open
enter
and
may
god
be
thy
guide
i
rose
as
he
commanded
me
and
a
dazzling
flash
of
light
struck
my
eyes
as
though
the
heavens
had
opened
the
blazing
cross
and
star
became
suddenly
severed
in
two
separate
portions
dividing
asunder
and
disclosing
what
seemed
to
be
a
hall
of
living
fire
flames
of
every
colour
burned
vividly
leaping
and
falling
without
pause
or
cessation
it
was
a
kind
of
open
furnace
in
which
surely
everything
must
be
consumed
i
looked
at
aselzion
in
silent
enquiry
not
in
fear
and
in
equally
silent
answer
he
pointed
to
the
glowing
vault
i
understood
and
without
another
moment
hesitation
i
advanced
towards
it
as
in
a
dream
i
heard
a
kind
of
murmuring
behind
me
and
suppressed
exclamations
from
the
students
or
disciples
of
aselzion
who
were
all
assembled
in
the
chapel
but
i
paid
no
heed
to
this
my
whole
soul
was
set
on
fulfilling
the
last
task
demanded
of
me
step
by
step
i
went
on
i
passed
aselzion
with
a
smile
i
murmured
we
shall
meet
again
and
then
i
advanced
towards
the
leaping
flames
i
felt
their
hot
breath
on
my
cheeks
the
scorching
wind
of
them
lifted
my
hair
through
the
folds
of
my
veil
an
idea
came
upon
me
that
for
some
cause
or
other
i
was
now
to
experience
that
which
men
call
death
and
that
through
this
means
i
should
meet
my
beloved
on
the
other
side
of
life
and
with
his
name
on
my
lips
and
a
passionate
appeal
to
him
in
my
heart
i
stepped
into
the
glowing
fire
as
i
did
so
i
lost
sight
of
aselzion
of
the
chapel
and
of
all
those
who
watched
my
movements
and
found
myself
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
darting
points
of
light
which
instead
of
scorching
and
withering
me
like
a
blown
leaf
in
a
storm
were
like
cool
and
fragrant
showers
playing
all
over
me
amazed
i
went
on
and
as
i
went
grew
bolder
at
one
step
i
was
bathed
in
a
rain
of
delicate
rays
like
sparkling
diamond
and
topaz
at
another
a
lovely
violet
light
shrouded
me
in
its
rich
hues
at
another
i
walked
in
melting
azure
like
the
hues
of
a
summer
sky
and
the
farther
in
i
went
the
deeper
and
more
glowing
was
the
light
about
me
i
felt
it
penetrating
every
pore
of
my
skin
i
held
my
hands
out
to
it
and
saw
them
look
transparent
in
the
fine
luminance
and
presently
gaining
courage
i
threw
back
my
veil
and
breathed
in
the
radiance
as
one
breathes
the
air
my
whole
body
grew
light
and
moved
as
though
it
floated
rather
than
walked
i
looked
with
unfatigued
undazzled
eyes
at
the
glittering
flames
that
sparkled
harmlessly
about
me
and
which
changed
to
lovely
shapes
of
flowers
and
leaves
beneath
my
feet
and
arched
themselves
over
my
head
like
branches
of
shading
trees
and
then
all
at
once
down
the
long
vista
i
caught
sight
of
a
shape
like
that
of
an
angel
an
angel
that
waited
for
me
with
watchful
eyes
and
outstretched
arms
it
was
but
a
moment
that
i
saw
this
vision
and
yet
i
knew
what
it
meant
and
i
pressed
on
and
on
with
all
my
soul
rising
in
me
as
it
were
to
go
forth
and
reach
that
companion
of
itself
which
stood
waiting
with
such
tender
patience
the
light
around
me
now
changed
to
waves
of
intense
luminance
which
swept
upon
me
like
waves
of
the
sea
and
i
allowed
myself
to
be
borne
along
with
them
i
knew
not
whither
all
at
once
i
saw
a
vast
pillar
of
fire
which
seemed
to
block
my
way
pausing
a
moment
i
looked
and
saw
it
break
asunder
and
form
the
cross
and
star
i
gazed
upward
wondering
its
rays
descending
seemed
to
pierce
my
eyes
my
brain
my
very
soul
i
sprang
forward
dazed
and
dazzled
murmuring
let
this
be
the
end
someone
caught
me
in
his
arms
someone
drew
me
to
his
breast
holding
me
there
as
if
i
were
the
dearest
possession
of
all
the
world
or
life
or
time
could
give
and
a
voice
infinitely
tender
answered
me
not
the
end
but
the
endless
my
beloved
mine
at
last
and
mine
for
ever
in
triumph
in
victory
in
perfect
joy
and
then
i
knew
i
knew
that
i
had
found
my
love
that
it
was
rafel
santoris
who
thus
held
me
in
his
close
embrace
that
i
had
fulfilled
my
own
desire
which
was
to
prove
my
faith
if
not
my
worthiness
that
i
had
won
all
i
wanted
in
this
world
and
the
next
and
that
nothing
could
ever
separate
our
souls
one
from
the
other
again
this
is
the
deep
eternal
ecstasy
of
a
knowledge
divinely
shared
by
the
very
angels
of
god
and
of
such
supernal
happiness
nothing
can
be
said
or
written
i
pen
these
last
words
on
the
deck
of
the
with
my
beloved
beside
me
the
sun
is
sinking
in
a
glory
of
crimson
we
are
about
to
anchor
in
still
waters
a
rosy
light
flashes
on
our
wonderful
white
sails
which
will
be
presently
furled
and
we
shall
sit
together
rafel
and
i
watching
the
night
draw
its
soft
dark
curtain
around
us
and
the
stars
come
out
in
the
sky
like
diamonds
embroidered
on
deep
purple
velvet
and
listening
to
the
gentle
murmur
of
the
little
waves
breaking
into
a
rocky
corner
of
the
distant
shore
and
the
evening
will
close
on
a
day
of
peace
and
happiness
one
of
the
many
unwearying
beautiful
days
which
like
a
procession
of
angels
bring
us
new
and
ever
more
perfect
joy
more
than
a
year
has
elapsed
since
my
in
the
house
of
aselzion
since
we
my
beloved
and
i
knelt
before
the
master
and
received
his
blessing
on
our
eternal
union
in
that
brief
time
i
have
lost
all
my
friends
and
acquaintances
who
have
if
i
may
so
express
it
become
afraid
of
me
afraid
chiefly
because
i
possess
all
that
the
world
can
give
me
without
their
advice
and
assistance
and
not
only
afraid
but
offended
because
i
have
found
the
companion
of
my
soul
with
whom
they
have
nothing
in
common
they
look
upon
me
as
to
society
and
can
not
realise
how
much
such
loss
is
gain
meanwhile
we
rafel
and
i
live
our
own
radiant
and
happy
lives
in
full
possession
of
all
that
makes
life
sweet
and
valuable
and
wanting
nothing
that
our
own
secret
forces
can
not
supply
wealth
is
ours
one
of
the
least
among
the
countless
gifts
nature
provides
for
those
among
her
children
who
know
where
to
find
her
inexhaustible
riches
and
we
also
enjoy
the
perfect
health
which
accompanies
the
constant
inflowing
of
an
exhaustless
vitality
and
though
the
things
we
attain
seem
to
others
so
that
even
while
accepting
help
and
benefit
at
our
hands
they
frown
and
shake
their
heads
at
the
attitude
we
assume
towards
social
hypocrisies
and
conventions
we
are
nevertheless
able
to
create
such
around
us
that
none
come
near
as
without
feeling
stronger
better
and
more
content
and
this
is
the
utmost
we
are
permitted
to
do
for
our
inasmuch
as
none
will
listen
to
argument
and
none
will
follow
advice
the
most
ardent
soul
that
ever
dwelt
in
human
form
can
not
lead
another
soul
in
the
way
of
lasting
life
or
lasting
happiness
if
it
refuses
to
go
and
there
is
no
more
absolute
truth
than
this
that
each
man
and
each
woman
must
make
his
or
her
own
destiny
both
here
and
hereafter
this
is
the
law
which
changes
not
and
which
can
never
be
subject
to
the
slightest
variation
forgiveness
of
sins
there
is
none
since
every
trespass
against
law
carries
its
own
punishment
necessity
for
prayer
there
is
none
since
every
faithful
wish
and
desire
of
the
soul
is
granted
without
parley
necessity
for
praise
there
is
much
since
the
soul
lives
and
grows
in
the
glory
of
its
creator
and
the
whole
secret
of
everlasting
life
and
happiness
is
contained
in
the
full
possession
and
control
of
the
divine
centre
of
ourselves
this
or
living
flame
which
must
be
dual
in
order
to
be
perfect
and
which
in
its
completed
state
is
an
eternal
force
which
nothing
can
destroy
and
nothing
can
resist
all
nature
harmonises
with
its
action
and
from
nature
it
draws
its
perpetual
sustenance
and
increasing
power
to
me
and
my
beloved
the
world
is
a
garden
of
paradise
rich
with
beauty
and
delight
we
live
in
it
as
a
part
of
its
loveliness
we
draw
into
our
own
organisations
the
warmth
of
the
sunlight
the
glory
of
colour
the
songs
of
sweet
birds
the
fragrance
of
flowers
and
the
exquisite
vibrations
of
the
light
and
air
like
two
notes
of
a
perfect
chord
we
sound
our
lives
on
the
keyboard
of
the
infinite
and
we
know
that
the
music
will
become
fuller
and
sweeter
as
the
eternal
seasons
roll
on
if
it
is
asked
why
there
should
have
been
any
necessity
to
pass
through
the
psychic
ordeal
imposed
on
me
by
aselzion
i
reply
look
at
the
world
in
which
men
and
women
generally
live
and
say
frankly
whether
its
ways
are
such
as
to
engender
happiness
look
at
society
look
at
politics
look
at
commerce
all
mere
schemes
for
and
more
than
all
look
at
the
sham
of
modern
religion
is
it
not
too
often
a
mere
blasphemy
and
affront
to
the
majesty
of
the
divine
and
are
not
many
if
not
all
these
mistakes
against
nature
these
offences
against
eternal
law
the
result
of
man
own
working
in
opposition
to
the
very
decrees
of
god
which
he
disobeys
even
while
recognising
that
they
exist
the
chief
point
of
aselzion
instruction
was
the
test
of
the
brain
and
soul
against
the
opposing
influences
of
others
and
this
is
truly
the
chief
hindrance
to
all
spiritual
progress
the
coward
sentiment
of
fear
itself
is
born
in
us
through
the
influence
of
timorous
persons
and
it
is
generally
the
dread
of
what
people
will
say
or
what
people
will
think
that
holds
us
back
from
performing
many
a
noble
action
it
should
be
thoroughly
understood
that
in
the
eternal
advancement
of
one
own
soul
people
and
their
influences
are
hindrances
to
progress
it
does
not
matter
a
jot
what
anybody
thinks
or
says
provided
the
central
altar
of
one
own
spirituality
is
clear
and
clean
for
the
steadfast
burning
of
the
dual
flame
of
life
and
love
all
opinion
all
criticism
becomes
absurd
in
such
matters
as
these
and
absolutely
worthless
it
does
not
affect
me
that
anyone
outside
my
sphere
of
thought
should
be
incredulous
of
my
beliefs
nor
can
it
move
me
from
my
happiness
to
know
that
persons
who
live
their
lives
on
a
lower
plane
consider
me
a
fool
for
electing
to
live
mine
on
the
highest
i
take
joy
in
the
fact
that
even
in
so
selfish
and
material
an
age
as
this
aselzion
still
has
his
students
and
disciples
a
mere
handful
out
of
the
million
it
is
true
but
still
sufficient
to
keep
the
beautiful
truth
of
the
power
alive
and
helpful
to
the
chosen
few
for
such
who
have
studied
these
truths
and
have
mastered
them
sufficiently
to
practise
them
in
the
ordinary
round
of
existence
life
presents
an
ever
living
happiness
and
offers
daily
proof
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
youth
remains
where
love
is
and
beauty
stays
with
health
and
vitality
decay
and
destruction
are
changes
which
are
brought
about
by
apathy
of
the
will
and
indifference
to
the
soul
existence
and
the
same
law
which
gives
the
soul
its
supreme
sovereignty
equally
works
for
its
release
from
effete
and
inactive
substances
to
those
who
would
ask
me
how
i
am
able
to
hold
and
keep
the
treasures
of
life
love
and
youth
which
the
majority
of
mankind
are
for
ever
losing
i
answer
that
i
can
say
no
more
than
i
have
said
and
the
lesson
which
all
may
learn
is
contained
in
what
i
have
written
it
is
no
use
arguing
with
those
whom
no
argument
will
convince
or
trying
to
teach
those
who
will
not
be
taught
we
my
beloved
and
i
can
only
prove
the
truth
of
the
soul
absolute
command
over
all
spiritual
material
and
elemental
forces
by
our
one
life
and
the
way
we
live
it
we
to
whom
everything
that
is
necessary
and
desirable
for
our
progress
comes
on
demand
we
whom
science
serves
as
an
lamp
realising
every
imaginable
delight
we
with
whom
love
which
with
many
human
beings
is
judged
the
most
variable
and
transitory
of
emotions
is
the
very
principle
of
life
the
very
essence
of
the
waves
of
the
air
through
which
we
move
and
have
our
being
the
attainment
of
such
happiness
as
ours
is
possible
to
all
but
there
is
only
one
way
of
attainment
and
the
clue
to
that
way
is
in
the
soul
of
each
individual
human
being
each
one
must
find
it
and
follow
it
regardless
of
all
which
may
be
brought
to
bear
on
his
or
her
actions
each
one
must
discover
the
of
life
movement
and
firmly
abide
by
it
it
is
the
immortal
creature
in
each
one
of
us
whose
destiny
is
to
make
eternal
progress
and
advancement
through
endless
phases
of
life
love
and
beauty
and
when
once
we
know
and
admit
the
actual
existence
of
this
immortal
centre
we
shall
realise
that
with
it
all
things
are
possible
save
death
radiating
outward
from
itself
it
can
preserve
the
health
and
youth
of
the
body
it
inhabits
indefinitely
till
of
its
own
desire
it
seeks
a
higher
plane
of
action
radiating
inwardly
it
is
an
irresistible
attractive
force
drawing
to
itself
the
powers
and
virtues
of
the
planet
on
which
it
dwells
and
making
all
the
forces
of
visible
and
invisible
nature
subject
to
its
will
and
command
this
is
one
of
those
great
truths
which
the
world
denies
but
which
it
is
destined
to
learn
within
the
next
two
thousand
years
if
anyone
should
desire
to
know
the
fate
of
motion
harland
and
his
daughter
that
fate
has
been
precisely
what
they
themselves
brought
about
by
their
way
of
life
and
action
morton
harland
himself
as
the
world
puts
it
of
a
painful
and
lingering
disease
which
could
have
been
cured
had
he
chosen
to
take
the
means
offered
to
him
through
rafel
santoris
he
did
not
choose
therefore
the
end
was
inevitable
catherine

and
they
two
now
live
a
sufficiently
wretched
life
together
she
a
moping
querulous
invalid

possessed
of
great
wealth
and
the
position
wealth
brings
we
never
meet
our
ways
are
now
for
ever
sundered
mine
is
the
upward
and
onward
path
and
with
my
beloved
i
ascend
the
supernal
heights
where
the
shadow
of
evil
never
falls
and
where
the
secret
of
life
is
centred
in
the
spirit
of
love
