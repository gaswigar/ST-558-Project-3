chapter
i
a
thrall
of
thralls
in
the
troubled
twilight
of
a
march
evening
ten
years
ago
an
old
man
whose
equipment
and
bearing
suggested
that
he
was
fresh
from
travel
walked
slowly
across
clerkenwell
green
and
by
the
graveyard
of
james
church
stood
for
a
moment
looking
about
him
his
age
could
not
be
far
from
seventy
but
despite
the
stoop
of
his
shoulders
he
gave
little
sign
of
failing
under
the
burden
of
years
his
sober
step
indicated
gravity
of
character
rather
than
bodily
feebleness
and
his
grasp
of
a
stout
stick
was
not
such
as
bespeaks
need
of
support
his
attire
was
neither
that
of
a
man
of
leisure
nor
of
the
kind
usually
worn
by
english
mechanics
instead
of
coat
and
waistcoat
he
wore
a
garment
something
like
a
fisherman
guernsey
and
over
this
a
coarse
short
cloak
picturesque
in
appearance
as
it
was
buffeted
by
the
wind
his
trousers
were
of
moleskin
his
boots
reached
almost
to
his
knees
for
he
had
the
cheapest
kind
of
undyed
felt
its
form
exactly
that
of
the
old
petasus
to
say
that
his
aspect
was
venerable
would
serve
to
present
him
in
a
measure
yet
would
not
be
wholly
accurate
for
there
was
too
much
of
past
struggle
and
present
anxiety
in
his
countenance
to
permit
full
expression
of
the
natural
dignity
of
the
features
it
was
a
fine
face
and
might
have
been
distinctly
noble
but
circumstances
had
marred
the
purpose
of
nature
you
perceived
that
his
cares
had
too
often
been
of
the
kind
which
are
created
by
ignoble
necessities
such
as
leave
to
most
men
of
his
standing
a
bare
humanity
of
visage
he
had
long
thin
white
hair
his
beard
was
short
and
merely
grizzled
in
his
left
hand
he
carried
a
bundle
which
probably
contained
clothing
the
by
which
he
had
paused
was
as
little
restful
to
the
eye
as
are
most
of
those
discoverable
in
the
byways
of
london
the
small
trees
that
grew
about
it
shivered
in
their
leaflessness
the
rank
grass
was
wan
under
the
failing
day
most
of
the
stones
leaned
this
way
or
that
emblems
of
neglect
they
were
very
white
at
the
top
and
darkened
downwards
till
the
damp
soil
made
them
black
and
certain
cats
and
dogs
were
prowling
or
sporting
among
the
graves
at
this
corner
the
east
wind
blew
with
malice
such
as
it
never
puts
forth
save
where
there
are
poorly
clad
people
to
be
pierced
it
swept
before
it
thin
clouds
of
unsavoury
dust
mingled
with
the
light
refuse
of
the
streets
above
the
shapeless
houses
night
was
signalling
a
murky
approach
the
sky
if
sky
it
could
be
called
gave
threatening
of
sleet
perchance
of
snow
and
on
every
side
was
the
rumble
of
traffic
the
voiceful
evidence
of
toil
and
of
poverty
hawkers
were
crying
their
goods
the
inevitable
organ
was
clanging
before
a
hard
by
the
was
hastening
along
with
monotonous
ringing
of
his
bell
and
hoarse
rhythmic
wail
the
old
man
had
fixed
his
eyes
half
absently
on
the
inscription
of
a
gravestone
near
him
a
lean
cat
springing
out
between
the
iron
railings
seemed
to
recall
his
attention
and
with
a
slight
sigh
he
went
forward
along
the
narrow
street
which
is
called
james
walk
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
reached
the
end
of
it
and
found
himself
facing
a
high
wall
wherein
at
this
point
was
an
arched
gateway
closed
with
black
doors
he
looked
at
the
gateway
then
fixed
his
gaze
on
something
that
stood
just
above
something
which
the
dusk
half
concealed
and
by
so
doing
made
more
impressive
it
was
the
sculptured
counterfeit
of
a
human
face
that
of
a
man
distraught
with
agony
the
eyes
stared
wildly
from
their
sockets
the
hair
struggled
in
maniac
disorder
the
forehead
was
wrung
with
torture
the
cheeks
sunken
the
throat
fearsomely
wasted
and
from
the
wide
lips
there
seemed
to
be
issuing
a
horrible
cry
above
this
hideous
effigy
was
carved
the
legend
house
of
detention
something
more
than
pain
came
to
the
old
man
face
as
he
looked
and
pondered
his
lips
trembled
like
those
of
one
in
anger
and
his
eyes
had
a
stern
resentful
gleaming
he
walked
on
a
few
paces
then
suddenly
stopped
where
a
woman
was
standing
at
an
open
door
ask
your
pardon
he
said
addressing
her
with
the
courtesy
which
owes
nothing
to
refined
intercourse
do
you
by
chance
know
anyone
of
the
name
of
snowdon
hereabouts
the
woman
replied
with
a
brief
negative
she
smiled
at
the
appearance
of
the
questioner
and
with
the
vulgar
instinct
looked
about
for
someone
to
share
her
amusement
inquire
at
the
at
the
corner
she
added
as
the
man
was
moving
away
been
here
a
long
time
i
he
accepted
her
advice
but
the
people
at
the
could
not
aid
his
search
he
thanked
them
paused
for
a
moment
with
his
eyes
down
then
again
sighed
slightly
and
went
forth
into
the
gathering
gloom
less
than
five
minutes
later
there
ran
into
the
same
house
of
refreshment
a
little
slight
girl
perhaps
thirteen
years
old
she
carried
a
jug
and
at
the
bar
asked
for
pint
of
old
six
the
barman
whilst
drawing
the
ale
called
out
to
a
man
who
had
entered
immediately
after
the
child
know
nobody
called
snowdon
about
do
you
mr
squibbs
the
individual
addressed
was
very
dirty
very
sleepy
and
seemingly
at
odds
with
mankind
he
replied
contemptuously
with
a
word
which
in
phonetic
rendering
may
perhaps
be
spelt
but
the
little
girl
was
looking
eagerly
from
one
man
to
the
other
what
had
been
said
appeared
to
excite
keen
interest
in
her
she
forgot
all
about
the
that
was
waiting
and
after
a
brief
but
obvious
struggle
with
timidity
said
in
an
uncertain
voice
somebody
been
asking
for
that
name
sir
they
have
the
barman
answered
in
surprise
my
name
snowdon
sir
jane
snowdon
she
reddened
over
all
her
face
as
soon
as
she
had
given
utterance
to
the
impulsive
words
the
barman
was
regarding
her
with
a
sort
of
and
squibbs
also
had
fixed
his
bleary
or
beery
eyes
upon
her
neither
would
have
admitted
an
active
interest
in
so
pale
and
thin
and
a
little
mortal
her
hair
hung
loose
and
had
no
covering
it
was
hair
of
no
particular
colour
and
seemed
to
have
been
for
a
long
time
utterly
untended
the
wind
on
her
run
hither
had
tossed
it
into
much
disorder
signs
there
were
of
some
kind
of
clothing
beneath
the
short
dirty
worn
dress
but
it
was
evidently
of
the
scantiest
description
the
freely
exposed
neck
was
very
thin
but
like
the
outline
of
her
face
spoke
less
of
a
feeble
habit
of
body
than
of
the
present
pinch
of
sheer
hunger
she
did
not
indeed
look
like
one
of
those
children
who
are
born
in
disease
and
starvation
and
put
to
nurse
upon
the
pavement
her
limbs
were
shapely
enough
her
back
was
straight
she
had
features
that
were
not
merely
human
but
and
her
look
had
in
it
the
light
of
an
intelligence
generally
sought
for
in
vain
among
the
children
of
the
street
the
blush
and
the
way
in
which
she
hung
her
head
were
likewise
tokens
of
a
nature
endowed
with
ample
sensitiveness
your
name
jane
snowdon
is
it
said
the
barman
just
three
minutes
an
too
late
it
a
fortune
after
you
he
was
a
rum
old
party
as
inquired
never
mind
it
all
in
a
life
there
fortunes
lost
every
week
by
a
good
deal
less
than
three
minutes
when
it
eh
mr
squibbs
squibbs
swore
with
emphasis
the
little
girl
took
her
jug
of
beer
and
was
turning
away
cried
the
barman
the
money
jane
if
mind
she
turned
again
in
increased
confusion
and
laid
coppers
on
the
counter
thereupon
the
man
asked
her
where
she
lived
she
named
a
house
in
clerkenwell
close
near
at
hand
live
there
she
shook
her
head
have
got
one
sir
is
it
as
you
live
with
then
peckover
sir
as
i
was
sayin
he
was
a
queer
old
joker
as
arsted
for
the
name
of
snowdon
should
wonder
if
you
see
him
goin
round
and
he
added
a
pretty
full
description
of
this
old
man
to
which
the
girl
listened
closely
then
she
went
thoughtfully
a
little
sadly
on
her
way
in
the
street
all
but
dark
by
this
time
she
cast
anxious
glances
onwards
and
behind
but
no
old
man
in
an
odd
hat
and
cloak
and
with
white
hair
was
discoverable
linger
she
might
not
she
reached
a
house
of
which
the
stood
open
it
looked
black
and
cavernous
within
but
she
advanced
with
the
step
of
familiarity
and
went
downstairs
to
a
through
the
door
came
a
strong
odour
and
a
hissing
sound
plainly
due
to
the
frying
of
sausages
before
jane
could
enter
she
was
greeted
sharply
in
a
voice
which
was
young
and
that
of
a
female
but
had
no
other
quality
of
graciousness
taken
your
time
my
lady
all
right
just
wait
till
i
my
tea
that
all
me
an
you
settle
accounts
see
if
we
do
mother
told
me
as
she
owed
you
a
lickin
and
i
pay
it
off
with
a
little
on
my
own
account
too
only
wait
till
i
my
tea
that
all
what
are
you
standin
there
for
like
a
fool
bring
that
beer
an
let
see
much
you
drank
have
put
my
lips
near
it
miss
indeed
i
have
pleaded
the
child
whose
face
of
dread
proved
both
natural
timidity
and
the
constant
apprehension
of
liar
that
what
you
always
was
an
always
will
take
that
the
speaker
was
a
girl
of
sixteen
tall
rather
bony
rudely
handsome
the
hand
with
which
she
struck
was
large
and
the
muscles
that
impelled
it
vigorous
her
dress
was
that
of
a
unsubstantial
but
of
ambitious
cut
her
hair
was
very
abundant
and
rose
upon
the
back
of
her
head
in
thick
coils
an
elegant
fringe
depending
in
front
the
fire
had
made
her
face
scarlet
and
in
the
lamplight
her
large
eyes
glistened
with
many
joys
first
and
foremost
miss
clementina
peckover
rejoiced
because
she
had
left
work
much
earlier
than
usual
and
was
about
to
enjoy
what
she
would
have
described
as
a
out
secondly
she
rejoiced
because
her
mother
the
landlady
of
the
house
was
absent
for
the
night
and
consequently
she
would
exercise
sole
authority
over
the
domestic
slave
jane
snowdon
that
is
to
say
would
indulge
to
the
uttermost
her
instincts
of
cruelty
in
tormenting
a
defenceless
creature
finally
a
cause
of
happiness
antecedent
to
the
others
but
less
vivid
in
her
mind
at
this
moment
in
the
next
room
lay
awaiting
burial
the
corpse
of
peckover
whose
death
six
days
ago
had
plunged
mother
and
daughter
into
profound
delight
partly
because
they
were
relieved
at
length
from
making
a
pretence
of
humanity
to
a
old
woman
partly
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
deceased
had
left
behind
her
a
sum
of
pounds
exclusive
of
moneys
due
from
a
exclaimed
miss
peckover
who
was
affectionately
known
to
her
intimates
as
as
she
watched
jane
stagger
back
from
the
blow
and
hide
her
face
in
silent
endurance
of
pain
just
a
morsel
to
stay
your
appetite
my
lady
you
did
expect
me
back
at
this
time
did
you
you
thought
as
you
was
goin
to
have
the
kitchen
to
yourself
when
mother
went
ha
ha
ho
ho
these
sausages
is
done
now
you
clean
that
and
if
i
can
find
a
speck
of
dirt
in
it
as
big
as
a
farden
i
take
you
by
the
of
the
an
clean
it
with
your
face
what
i
do
understand
oh
i
mean
what
i
say
my
lady
me
an
you
to
spend
a
evenin
together
there
no
two
ways
about
that
he
ho
he
he
the
frankness
of
clem
brutality
went
far
towards
redeeming
her
character
the
exquisite
satisfaction
with
which
she
viewed
present
misery
the
broad
joviality
with
which
she
gloated
over
the
prospect
of
cruelties
shortly
to
be
inflicted
put
her
at
once
on
a
par
with
the
noble
savage
running
wild
in
woods
civilisation
could
bring
no
charge
against
this
young
woman
it
and
she
had
no
common
criterion
who
knows
but
this
lust
of
hers
for
sanguinary
domination
was
the
natural
enough
issue
of
the
brutalising
serfdom
of
her
predecessors
in
the
family
line
of
the
peckovers
a
thrall
suddenly
endowed
with
authority
will
assuredly
make
bitter
work
for
the
luckless
creature
in
the
next
degree
of
thraldom
a
cloth
was
already
spread
across
one
end
of
the
deal
table
with
such
other
preparations
for
a
meal
as
clem
deemed
adequate
the
sausages
five
in
number
she
had
emptied
from
the
directly
on
to
her
plate
and
with
them
all
the
black
rich
juice
that
had
exuded
in
the
process
of
cooking
particularly
rich
owing
to
its
having
several
times
caught
fire
and
blazed
triumphantly
on
sitting
down
and
squaring
her
comely
frame
to
work
the
first
thing
clem
did
was
to
take
a
long
draught
out
of
the
refreshed
thus
she
poured
the
remaining
liquor
into
a
glass
ready
at
hand
was
mustard
made
in
a
having
taken
a
certain
quantity
of
this
condiment
on
to
her
knife
she
proceeded
to
spread
each
sausage
with
it
from
end
to
end
patting
them
in
a
friendly
way
as
she
finished
the
operation
next
she
sprinkled
them
with
pepper
and
after
that
she
constructed
a
little
pile
of
salt
on
the
side
of
the
plate
using
her
fingers
to
convey
it
from
the
it
remained
to
cut
a
thick
slice
of
bread
she
held
the
loaf
pressed
to
her
bosom
whilst
doing
this
and
to
crush
it
down
well
into
the
black
grease
beside
the
sausages
then
clem
was
ready
to
begin
for
five
minutes
she
fed
heartily
showing
really
remarkable
skill
in
conveying
pieces
of
sausage
to
her
mouth
by
means
of
the
knife
alone
finding
it
necessary
to
breathe
at
last
she
looked
round
at
jane
the
was
on
her
knees
near
the
fire
scrubbing
very
hard
at
the
pan
with
successive
pieces
of
newspaper
it
was
a
sight
to
increase
the
gusto
of
clem
meal
but
of
a
sudden
there
came
into
the
girl
mind
a
yet
more
delightful
thought
i
have
mentioned
that
in
the
lay
the
body
of
a
dead
woman
it
was
already
encoffined
and
waited
for
interment
on
the
morrow
when
peckover
would
arrive
with
a
certain
female
relative
from
albans
now
the
proximity
of
this
corpse
was
a
ceaseless
occasion
of
dread
and
misery
to
jane
snowdon
the
poor
child
had
each
night
to
make
up
a
bed
for
herself
in
this
dragging
together
a
little
heap
of
rags
when
mother
and
daughter
were
gone
up
to
their
chamber
and
since
the
old
woman
death
it
was
much
if
jane
had
enjoyed
one
hour
of
unbroken
sleep
she
endeavoured
to
hide
these
feelings
but
clem
with
her
red
indian
scent
divined
them
accurately
enough
she
hit
upon
a
good
idea
into
the
next
room
she
commanded
suddenly
fetch
the
matches
off
of
the
i
shall
want
to
go
upstairs
presently
to
see
if
you
scrubbed
the
well
jane
was
blanched
but
she
rose
from
her
knees
at
once
and
reached
a
candlestick
from
above
the
fireplace
that
for
shouted
clem
with
her
mouth
full
no
need
of
a
light
to
find
the
if
you
not
off
jane
hastened
from
the
kitchen
clem
yelled
to
her
to
close
the
door
and
she
had
no
choice
but
to
obey
in
the
dark
passage
outside
there
was
darkness
that
might
be
felt
the
child
all
but
fainted
with
the
sickness
of
horror
as
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
other
door
and
began
to
grope
her
way
she
knew
exactly
where
the
coffin
was
she
knew
that
to
avoid
touching
it
in
the
diminutive
room
was
all
but
impossible
and
touch
it
she
did
her
anguish
uttered
itself
not
in
a
mere
sound
of
terror
but
in
a
broken
word
or
two
of
a
prayer
she
knew
by
heart
including
a
name
which
sounded
like
a
charm
against
evil
she
had
reached
the
oh
she
could
not
could
not
find
the
matches
yes
at
last
her
hand
closed
on
them
a
blind
rush
and
she
was
out
again
in
the
passage
she
the
with
limbs
that
quivered
with
the
sound
of
dreadful
voices
ringing
about
her
and
blankness
before
her
eyes
clem
laughed
heartily
then
finished
her
beer
in
a
long
enjoyable
pull
her
appetite
was
satisfied
the
last
trace
of
oleaginous
matter
had
disappeared
from
her
plate
and
now
she
toyed
with
little
pieces
of
bread
lightly
dipped
into
the
these
put
her
into
excellent
humour
presently
she
crossed
her
arms
and
leaned
back
there
was
no
denying
that
clem
was
handsome
at
sixteen
she
had
all
her
charms
in
apparent
maturity
and
they
were
of
the
coarsely
magnificent
order
her
forehead
was
low
and
of
great
width
her
nose
was
well
shapen
and
had
large
sensual
apertures
her
cruel
lips
may
be
seen
on
certain
fine
antique
busts
the
neck
that
supported
her
heavy
head
was
splendidly
rounded
in
laughing
she
became
a
model
for
an
artist
an
embodiment
of
fierce
life
independent
of
morality
her
health
was
probably
less
sound
than
it
seemed
to
be
one
would
have
compared
her
not
to
some
piece
of
exuberant
normal
vegetation
but
rather
to
a
rank
growth
the
putrid
soil
of
that
nether
world
yields
other
forms
besides
the
obviously
blighted
and
sapless
you
done
any
work
for
hewett
she
asked
of
her
victim
after
sufficiently
savouring
the
spectacle
of
terror
miss
i
did
the
fireplace
an
fetched
fourteen
of
coals
an
washed
out
a
few
things
did
she
give
you
penny
miss
i
gave
it
to
peckover
before
she
went
you
did
well
look
you
just
remember
in
future
that
all
you
get
from
the
lodgers
belongs
to
me
an
not
to
mother
it
a
new
arrangement
understand
an
if
you
dare
to
give
up
a
to
mother
i
lick
you
till
you
nothin
but
a
bag
o
bones
understand
having
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
devised
this
ingenious
difficulty
for
the
child
who
was
sure
to
suffer
in
many
ways
from
such
a
conflict
of
authorities
clem
began
to
consider
how
she
should
spend
her
evening
after
all
jane
was
too
a
victim
to
afford
long
entertainment
clem
would
have
liked
dealing
with
some
one
who
showed
fight
some
one
with
whom
she
could
try
savage
issue
in
real
conflict
she
had
in
mind
a
really
exquisite
piece
of
cruelty
but
it
was
a
joy
necessarily
postponed
to
a
late
hour
of
the
night
in
the
meantime
it
would
perhaps
be
as
well
to
take
a
stroll
with
a
view
of
meeting
a
few
friends
as
they
came
away
from
the
she
was
pondering
the
invention
of
some
long
and
hard
task
to
be
executed
by
jane
in
her
absence
when
a
knocking
at
the
made
itself
heard
clem
at
once
went
up
to
see
who
the
visitor
was
a
woman
in
a
long
cloak
and
a
showy
bonnet
stood
on
the
step
protecting
herself
with
an
umbrella
from
the
bitter
sleet
which
the
wind
was
now
driving
through
the
darkness
she
said
that
she
wished
to
see
hewett
front
replied
clem
in
the
offhand
impertinent
tone
wherewith
she
always
signified
to
strangers
her
position
in
the
house
the
visitor
regarded
her
with
a
look
of
lofty
contempt
and
having
deliberately
closed
her
umbrella
advanced
towards
the
stairs
clem
drew
into
the
back
regions
for
a
few
moments
but
as
soon
as
she
heard
the
closing
of
a
door
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
she
too
ascended
going
on
with
a
noiselessness
which
indicated
another
side
of
her
character
having
reached
the
room
which
the
visitor
had
entered
she
brought
her
ear
close
to
the
keyhole
and
remained
in
that
attitude
for
a
long
time
nearly
twenty
minutes
in
fact
her
sudden
and
swift
return
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
was
followed
by
the
descent
of
the
woman
in
the
showy
bonnet
peckover
cried
the
latter
when
she
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
what
is
it
asked
clem
seeming
to
come
up
from
the
kitchen
you
the
goodness
to
go
an
speak
to
hewett
for
a
hinstant
said
the
woman
with
much
affectation
of
refined
speech
right
i
will
just
now
if
i
time
the
visitor
tossed
her
head
and
departed
whereupon
clem
at
once
ran
upstairs
in
five
minutes
she
was
back
in
the
kitchen
she
addressed
jane

where
kirkwood
works

john
square

back
that
all
now

off
before
i
skin
you
alive
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
lay
something
that
had
once
been
a
girl
hat
this
jane
at
once
snatched
up
and
put
on
her
head
without
other
covering
she
ran
forth
upon
her
errand
chapter
ii
a
friend
in
request
it
was
the
hour
of
the
unyoking
of
men
in
the
highways
and
byways
of
clerkenwell
there
was
a
thronging
of
released
toilers
of
young
and
old
of
male
and
female
forth
they
streamed
from
factories
and
workrooms
anxious
to
make
the
most
of
the
few
hours
during
which
they
might
live
for
themselves
great
numbers
were
still
bent
over
their
labour
and
would
be
for
hours
to
come
but
the
majority
had
leave
to
wend
stablewards
along
the
main
thoroughfares
the
was
clangorous
every
omnibus
that
clattered
by
was
heavily
laden
with
passengers
tarpaulins
gleamed
over
the
knees
of
those
who
sat
outside
this
way
and
that
the
lights
were
blurred
into
a
misty
radiance
overhead
was
mere
blackness
whence
descended
the
lashing
rain
there
was
a
ceaseless
scattering
of
mud
there
were
blocks
in
the
traffic
attended
with
rough
jest
or
angry
curse
there
was
jostling
on
the
crowded
pavement
began
to
brighten
up
to
bestir
themselves
for
the
evening
business
streets
that
had
been
hives
of
activity
since
early
morning
were
being
abandoned
to
silence
and
darkness
and
the
sweeping
wind
at
noon
there
was
sunlight
on
the
surrey
hills
the
fields
and
lanes
were
fragrant
with
the
first
breath
of
spring
and
from
the
shelter
of
budding
copses
many
a
primrose
looked
tremblingly
up
to
the
vision
of
blue
sky
but
of
these
things
clerkenwell
takes
no
count
here
it
had
been
a
day
like
any
other
consisting
of
so
many
hours
each
representing
a
fraction
of
the
weekly
wage
go
where
you
may
in
clerkenwell
on
every
hand
are
multiform
evidences
of
toil
intolerable
as
a
nightmare
it
is
not
as
in
those
parts
of
london
where
the
main
thoroughfares
consist
of
shops
and
warehouses
and
workrooms
whilst
the
streets
that
are
hidden
away
on
either
hand
are
devoted
in
the
main
to
dwellings
here
every
alley
is
thronged
with
small
industries
all
but
every
door
and
window
exhibits
the
advertisement
of
a
craft
that
is
carried
on
within
here
you
may
see
how
men
have
multiplied
toil
for
toil
sake
have
wrought
to
devise
work
superfluous
have
worn
their
lives
away
in
imagining
new
forms
of
weariness
the
energy
the
ingenuity
daily
put
forth
in
these
grimy
burrows
task
the
brain
power
of
wondering
but
that
those
who
sit
here
through
the
livelong
day
through
every
season
through
all
the
years
of
the
life
that
is
granted
them
who
strain
their
eyesight
who
overtax
their
muscles
who
nurse
disease
in
their
frames
who
put
resolutely
from
them
the
thought
of
what
existence
be
that
these
do
it
all
without
prospect
or
hope
of
reward
save
the
permission
to
eat
and
sleep
and
bring
into
the
world
other
creatures
to
strive
with
them
for
bread
surely
that
thought
is
yet
more
marvellous

the

is
not
so
much
for
rude

as
for
the
cunning
fingers
and
the
contriving
brain
the
inscriptions
on
the
would
make
you
believe
that
you
were
in
a
region
of
gold
and
silver
and
precious
stones
in
the
recesses
of
dim
byways
where
sunshine
and
free
air
are
forgotten
things
where
families
herd
together
in
garrets
and
cellars
craftsmen
are
for
ever
handling
jewellery
shaping
bright
ornaments
for
the
necks
and
arms
of
such
as
are
born
to
the
joy
of
life
wealth
inestimable
is
ever
flowing
through
these
workshops
and
the
hands
that
have
been
stained
with
may
as
likely
as
not
some
day
extend
themselves
in
petition
for
a
crust
in
this
house
as
the
announcement
tells
you
business
is
carried
on
by
a
trader
in
diamonds
and
next
door
is
a
den
full
of
children
who
wait
for
their
day
one
meal
until
their
mother
has
come
home
with
her
chance
earnings
a
strange
enough
region
wherein
to
wander
and
muse
inextinguishable
laughter
were
perchance
the
fittest
result
of
such
musing
yet
somehow
the
heart
grows
heavy
somehow
the
blood
is
troubled
in
its
course
and
the
pulses
begin
to
throb
hotly
amid
the
crowds
of
workpeople
jane
snowdon
made
what
speed
she
might
it
was
her
custom
whenever
dispatched
on
an
errand
to
run
till
she
could
run
no
longer
then
to
hasten
along
panting
until
breath
and
strength
were
recovered
when
it
was
either
of
the
peckovers
who
sent
her
she
knew
that
reprimand
was
inevitable
on
her
return
be
she
ever
so
speedy
but
her
nature
was
incapable
alike
of
rebellion
and
of
that
sullen
callousness
which
would
have
come
to
the
aid
of
most
girls
in
her
position
she
did
not
serve
her
tyrants
with
willingness
for
their
brutality
filled
her
with
a
sense
of
injustice
yet
the
fact
that
she
was
utterly
dependent
upon
them
for
her
livelihood
that
but
for
their
grace
as
they
were
perpetually
reminding
her
she
would
have
been
a
workhouse
child
had
a
mitigating
effect
upon
the
bitterness
she
could
not
wholly
subdue
there
was
however
another
reason
why
she
sped
eagerly
on
her
present
mission
the
man
to
whom
she
was
conveying
hewett
message
was
one
of
the
very
few
persons
who
had
ever
treated
her
with
human
kindness
she
had
known
him
by
name
and
by
sight
for
some
years
and
since
her
mother
death
she
was
eleven
when
that
happened
he
had
by
degrees
grown
to
represent
all
that
she
understood
by
the
word
it
was
seldom
that
words
were
exchanged
between
them
the
opportunity
came
scarcely
oftener
than
once
a
month
but
whenever
it
did
come
it
made
a
bright
moment
in
her
existence
once
before
she
had
fetched
him
of
an
evening
to
see
hewett
and
as
they
walked
together
he
had
spoken
with
what
seemed
to
her
wonderful
gentleness
with
consideration
inconceivable
from
a
tall
bearded
man
and
well
to
do
in
the
world
perhaps
he
would
speak
in
the
same
way
the
thought
of
it
made
her
regardless
of
the
cold
rain
that
was
drenching
her
miserable
garment
of
the
wind
that
now
and
then
as
she
turned
a
corner
took
away
her
breath
and
made
her
cease
from
running
she
reached
john
square
and
paused
at
length
by
a
door
on
which
was
the
inscription
lewis
working
jeweller
it
was
just
possible
that
the
men
had
already
left
she
waited
for
several
minutes
with
anxious
mind
no
the
door
opened
and
two
workmen
came
forth
eagerness
impelled
her
to
address
one
of
them
sir
kirkwood
has
gone
yet
has
he
he
ai
the
man
answered
pleasantly
and
turning
back
he
called
to
some
one
within
the
doorway
sidney
here
your
sweetheart
waiting
for
you
jane
shrank
aside
but
in
a
moment
she
saw
a
familiar
figure
she
advanced
again
and
eagerly
delivered
her
message
right
jane
i
walk
on
with
you
was
the
reply
and
whilst
the
other
two
men
were
laughing
kirkwood
strode
away
by
the
girl
side
he
seemed
to
be
and
for
some
hundred
distance
was
silent
then
he
stopped
of
a
sudden
and
looked
down
at
his
companion
jane
he
said
get
your
death
running
about
in
weather
like
this
he
touched
her
dress
thought
so
you
wet
through
there
followed
an
inarticulate
growl
and
immediately
he
stripped
off
his
short
overcoat
put
this
on
right
over
your
head
do
as
i
tell
you
child
he
seemed
impatient
was
he
going
to
talk
with
her
as
before
jane
felt
her
heart
sinking
with
her
hunger
for
kind
and
gentle
words
she
thought
nothing
of
the
character
of
the
night
and
that
sidney
kirkwood
might
reasonably
be
anxious
to
get
over
the
ground
as
quickly
as
possible
is
mrs
hewett
sidney
asked
when
they
were
walking
on
again
poorly
eh
and
the
baby
then
he
was
again
mute
jane
had
something
she
wished
to
say
to
him
wished
very
much
indeed
yet
she
felt
it
would
have
been
difficult
even
if
he
had
encouraged
her
as
he
kept
silence
and
walked
so
quickly
speech
on
her
part
was
utterly
forbidden
kirkwood
however
suddenly
remembered
that
his
strides
were
disproportionate
to
the
child
steps
she
was
an
odd
figure
thus
disguised
in
his
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
by
a
street
lamp
and
smiled
but
with
a
mixture
of
pain
a
bit
warmer
so
he
asked
yes
sir
you
got
a
jacket
jane
all
to
pieces
sir
they
goin
to
have
it
mended
i
think
was
the
word
by
which
alone
jane
ventured
to
indicate
her
aunt
to
eh
i
think
they
better
be
quick
about
it
ha
that
was
the
old
tone
of
kindness
how
it
entered
into
her
blood
and
warmed
it
she
allowed
herself
one
quick
glance
at
him
i
walk
too
quick
for
you
no
sir
kirkwood
please
there
something
i
the
sentence
had
as
it
were
begun
itself
but
timidity
cut
it
short
sidney
stopped
and
looked
at
her
something
you
wanted
to
tell
me
jane
he
encouraged
her
and
at
length
she
made
her
disclosure
it
was
of
what
had
happened
in
the
the
young
man
listened
with
much
attention
walking
very
slowly
he
got
her
to
repeat
her
description
of
the
old
man
who
had
been
inquiring
for
people
named
snowdon
think
that
you
should
have
been
just
too
late
he
exclaimed
with
annoyance
you
any
idea
who
he
was
ca
think
sir
jane
replied
sadly
sidney
took
a
hopeful
tone
thought
it
very
likely
that
the
inquirer
would
pursue
his
search
with
success
being
so
near
the
house
where
jane
parents
had
lived
keep
my
eyes
open
he
said
i
might
see
him
he
be
easy
to
recognise
i
should
think
would
you
tell
him
sir
jane
asked
eagerly
of
course
i
would
you
like
me
to
would
you
jane
reply
left
small
doubt
on
that
score
her
companion
looked
down
at
her
again
and
said
with
compassionate
gentleness
a
good
heart
jane
things
be
better
some
day
no
doubt
you
think
so
sir
the
significance
of
the
simple
words
was
beyond
all
that
eloquence
could
have
conveyed
sidney
muttered
to
himself
as
he
had
done
before
like
one
who
is
angry
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
child
shoulder
for
a
moment
a
few
minutes
more
and
they
were
passing
along
by
the
prison
wall
under
the
ghastly
head
now
happily
concealed
by
darkness
jane
stopped
a
little
short
of
the
house
and
removed
the
coat
that
had
so
effectually
sheltered
her
you
sir
she
said
returning
it
to
sidney
he
took
it
without
speaking
and
threw
it
over
his
arm
at
the
door
now
closed
jane
gave
a
single
knock
they
were
admitted
by
clem
who
in
regarding
kirkwood
wore
her
haughtiest
demeanour
this
young
man
had
never
paid
homage
of
any
kind
to
miss
peckover
and
such
neglect
was
by
no
means
what
she
was
used
to
other
men
who
came
to
the
house
took
every
opportunity
of
paying
her
broad
compliments
and
some
went
so
far
as
to
offer
practical
testimony
of
their
admiration
sidney
merely
had
a
do
you
do
miss
at
her
service
coquetry
had
failed
to
soften
him
clem
accordingly
behaved
as
if
he
had
given
her
mortal
offence
on
some
recent
occasion
she
took
care
moreover
to
fling
a
few
fierce
words
at
jane
before
the
latter
disappeared
into
the
house
thereupon
sidney
looked
at
her
sternly
he
said
nothing
knowing
that
interference
would
only
result
in
harsher
treatment
for
the
poor
little
slave
know
your
way
upstairs
i
said
clem
as
if
he
were
all
but
a
stranger
you
i
do
was
sidney
reply
indeed
he
had
climbed
these
stairs
innumerable
times
during
the
last
three
years
the
musty
smells
were
associated
with
ever
so
many
bygone
thoughts
and
states
of
feeling
the
stains
on
the
wall
had
it
been
daylight
the
irregularities
of
the
bare
wooden
steps
were
remembrancers
of
projects
and
hopes
and
disappointments
for
many
months
now
every
visit
had
been
with
heavier
heart
his
tap
at
the
hewetts
door
had
a
melancholy
sound
to
him
a
woman
voice
bade
him
enter
he
stepped
into
a
room
which
was
not
disorderly
or
unclean
but
presented
the
chill
discomfort
of
poverty
the
principal
almost
the
only
articles
of
furniture
were
a
large
bed
a
stand
a
kitchen
table
and
two
or
three
chairs
of
which
the
cane
seats
were
bulged
and
torn
a
few
meaningless
pictures
hung
here
and
there
and
on
the
which
sloped
forward
somewhat
stood
some
paltry
ornaments
secured
in
their
places
by
a
piece
of
string
stretched
in
front
of
them
the
living
occupants
were
four
children
and
their
mother
two
little
girls
six
and
seven
years
old
respectively
were
on
the
floor
near
the
fire
a
boy
of
four
was
playing
with
pieces
of
at
the
table
the
remaining
child
was
an
infant
born
but
a
fortnight
ago
lying
at
its
mother
breast
hewett
sat
on
the
bed
and
bent
forward
in
an
attitude
of
physical
weakness
her
age
was
but
she
looked
several
years
older
at
nineteen
she
had
married
her
husband
john
hewett
having
two
children
by
a
previous
union
her
face
could
never
have
been
very
attractive
but
it
was
and
wore
its
pleasantest
aspect
as
she
smiled
on
sidney
entrance
you
would
have
classed
her
at
once
with
those
yet
women
who
are
only
too
ready
to
meet
affliction
and
who
if
circumstances
be
calamitous
are
more
harmful
than
an
enemy
to
those
they
hold
dear
she
was
rather
wrapped
up
than
dressed
and
her
hair
thin
and
was
tied
in
a
ragged
knot
she
wore
slippers
the
upper
parts
of
which
still
adhered
to
the
soles
only
by
miracle
it
looked
very
much
as
if
the
same
relation
subsisted
between
her
frame
and
the
life
that
informed
it
for
there
was
no
blood
in
her
cheeks
no
lustre
in
her
eye
the
baby
at
her
bosom
moaned
in
the
act
of
sucking
one
knew
not
how
the
poor
woman
could
supply
sustenance
to
another
being
the
children
were
not
dirty
nor
uncared
for
but
their
clothing
hung
very
loosely
upon
them
their
flesh
was
unhealthy
their
voices
had
an
unnatural
sound
sidney
stepped
up
to
the
bed
and
gave
his
hand
so
glad
you
come
before
clara
said
hewett
hoped
you
would
but
she
ca
be
long
an
i
want

sidney

a
chair
near
to
her

in
a
grumbling
voice

as

good
thing

it
sidney
i
know
do
want
her
to
go
but
what
to
be
done
what
to
be
done
her
wailing
voice
caused
the
baby
to
wail
likewise
kirkwood
looked
about
the
room
with
face
set
in
anxious
discontent
it
no
use
mrs
hewett
he
exclaimed
suddenly
turning
to
her
she
mean
it
wo
she
ever
listen
to
me
the
woman
shook
her
head
miserably
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
done
all
i
could
she
replied
half
sobbing
have
you
know
i
have
sidney
she
that
it
seems
as
if
she
would
listen
to
nobody
at
least
nobody
as
we
knows
anything
about
do
you
mean
by
that
he
inquired
abruptly
you
think
any
one
else
can
i
tell
i
got
no
reason
for
thinkin
it
but
how
can
i
tell
no
i
believe
it
nothin
but
her
an
the
fancies
she
got
into
her
both
her
an
bob
there
no
doin
with
them
bob
he
that
wasteful
with
his
money
an
now
he
talks
about
goin
an
gettin
a
room
in
another
when
he
might
just
as
well
make
all
the
savin
he
can
but
no
that
ai
his
idea
nor
yet
his
sister
i
suppose
it
their
mother
as
they
take
after
though
their
father
he
wo
own
to
it
an
i
do
blame
him
for
not
ill
of
her
as
is
gone
i
should
be
that
wretched
if
i
thought
my
own
was
goin
to
turn
out
the
same
but
there
john
he
ai
a
wasteful
man
no
one
ca
say
it
of
him
he
got
his
fancies
but
never
made
him
selfish
to
others
as
well
you
know
sidney
he
been
the
best
to
me
as
ever
a
poor
woman
had
an
i
say
it
with
my
last
breath
she
cried
pitifully
for
a
few
moments
sidney
mastering
his
own
wretchedness
which
he
could
not
altogether
conceal
made
attempts
to
strengthen
her
things
are
at
the
worst
they
begin
to
mend
he
said
be
much
longer
before
he
gets
work
and
look
here
hewett
i
hear
a
word
against
it
you
must
and
shall
let
me
lend
you
something
to
go
on
with
durs
i
durs
sidney
john
wo
have
it
he
always
once
begin
that
an
it
all
up
you
never
earn
no
more
of
your
own
it
one
of
his
fancies
an
you
know
it
is
you
only
make
trouble
sidney
all
i
can
say
is
he
an
unreasonable
and
selfish
man
no
john
ai
selfish
never
say
that
it
only
his
fancies
sidney
there
one
trouble
you
better
get
rid
of
at
all
events
let
clara
go
to
tubbs
you
never
have
any
peace
till
she
does
i
can
see
that
why
should
she
go
after
all
she
seventeen
if
she
ca
respect
herself
now
she
never
will
and
there
no
help
for
it
tell
john
to
let
her
go
there
was
bitterness
in
the
tone
with
which
he
gave
this
advice
he
threw
out
his
hands
impatiently
and
then
flung
himself
back
so
that
the
cranky
chair
creaked
and
tottered
if
comes
to
her
what
then
returned
hewett
plaintively
know
well
enough
why
tubbs
wants
her
it
only
because
she
an
she
bring
more
people
to
the
bar
john
knows
that
an
it
makes
him
wild
mind
what
i
tellin
you
sidney
if
any
comes
to
that
girl
her
father
go
out
of
his
i
know
he
will
i
know
he
will
he
worships
the
ground
as
she
walks
on
an
if
it
had
been
for
that
she
never
have
given
him
the
trouble
as
she
is
doin
it
a
been
better
for
her
if
she
had
a
father
like
mine
as
was
a
hard
careless
man
i
do
wish
to
say
no
of
him
as
is
dead
an
buried
an
my
own
father
too
but
he
was
a
hard
father
to
us
an
as
long
as
he
lived
we
durs
say
not
a
word
as
he
did
like
he
a
killed
me
if
i
gone
on
like
clara
it
was
a
good
thing
as
he
was
gone
before
do
speak
of
that
interposed
kirkwood
with
kindly
firmness
long
since
over
and
done
with
and
forgotten
no
not
forgotten
clara
knows
an
that
partly
why
she
makes
so
little
of
me
i
know
it
is
do
believe
it
she
a
girl
a
heavy
footstep
on
the
stairs
checked
him
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
there
entered
a
youth
of
nineteen
clad
as
an
artisan
he
was
a
shapely
fellow
though
not
quite
so
stout
as
perfect
health
would
have
made
him
and
had
a
face
of
singular
attractiveness
delicate
featured
with
intelligence
the
intelligence
was
perhaps
even
too
pronounced
seen
in
profile
the
countenance
had
an
excessive
eagerness
there
was
selfish
force
about
the
lips
moreover
which
would
have
been
better
away
his
noisy
entrance
indicated
an
impulsive
character
and
the
nod
with
which
he
greeted
kirkwood
was
that
medal
i
cast
last
night
mother
he
asked
searching
in
various
corners
of
the
room
and
throwing
things
about
do
mind
what
you
up
to
bob
remonstrated
hewett
find
it
on
the
mantel
in
the
other
room
do
make
such
a
noise
the
young
man
rushed
forth
and
in
a
moment
returned
in
his
hand
which
was
very
black
and
shone
as
if
from
the
manipulation
of
metals
he
held
a
small
bright
medal
he
showed
it
to
sidney
saying
think
o
that
the
work
was
delicate
and
of
clever
design
it
represented
a
racehorse
at
full
speed
a
jockey
rising
in
the
stirrups
and
beating
it
with
orthodox
brutality
at
the
epsom
spring
meetin
he
said
got
money
on
him
and
with
another
indifferent
nod
he
flung
out
of
the
room
before
hewett
and
kirkwood
could
renew
their
conversation
there
was
another
step
at
the
door
and
the
father
of
the
family
presented
himself
chapter
iii
a
superfluous
family
kirkwood
face
as
he
turned
to
greet
the
changed
suddenly
to
an
expression
of
surprise
what
have
you
been
doing
to
your
hair
he
asked
abruptly
a
stranger
would
have
seen
nothing
remarkable
in
john
hewett
hair
unless
he
had
reflected
that
being
so
sparse
it
had
preserved
its
dark
hue
and
its
gloss
somewhat
unusually
the
short
beard
and
whiskers
were
also
of
richer
colour
than
comported
with
the
rest
of
the
appearance
judging
from
his
features
alone
one
would
have
taken
john
for
sixty
at
least
his
years
were
in
truth
not
quite
he
had
the
look
of
one
worn
out
with
anxiety
and
hardship
the
lines
engraven
upon
his
face
were
of
extraordinary
depth
and
frequency
there
seemed
to
be
little
flesh
between
the
dry
skin
and
the
bones
which
sharply
outlined
his
visage
the
lips
were
like
those
of
his
son
prominent
and
nervous
but
none
of
bob
shrewdness
was
here
discoverable
feeling
rather
than
intellect
appeared
to
be
the
characteristic
his
eyes
expressed
perhaps
obstinacy
and
he
had
a
peculiarly
dogged
manner
of
holding
his
head
at
the
present
moment
he
was
suffering
from
extreme
fatigue
he
let
himself
sink
upon
a
chair
threw
his
hat
on
to
the
floor
and
rested
a
hand
on
each
knee
his
boots
were
thickly
covered
with
mud
his
corduroy
trousers
were
splashed
with
the
same
rain
had
drenched
him
it
trickled
to
the
floor
from
all
his
garments
for
answer
to
sidney
question
he
nodded
towards
his
wife
and
said
in
a
thick
voice
her
dyed
it
hewett
explained
with
no
smile
thought
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
could
get
work
was
his
lookin
too
old
so
it
was
exclaimed
hewett
with
an
angry
vehemence
which
at
once
declared
his
position
and
revealed
much
of
his
history
it
was
my
hair
was
a
bit
turned
an
nowadays
there
no
chance
for
old
men
ask
any
one
you
like
why
there
sam
lang
could
even
get
a
job
at
gardenin
his
hair
was
a
bit
turned
it
was
him
as
told
me
what
to
do
dye
your
hair
jack
he
says
it
what
i
had
to
myself
he
says
they
wo
have
old
men
nowadays
at
no
price
why
jarvey
the
painter
you
know
him
sidney
his
guvnor
sent
him
on
a
job
to
jones
place
an
they
sent
him
back
why
he
an
old
man
they
says
what
good
a
man
of
that
age
for
liftin
ladders
about
jarvey
no
older
than
me
sidney
knitted
his
brows
he
had
heard
the
complaint
from
too
many
men
to
be
able
to
dispute
its
justice
there
twice
too
many
of
us
for
the
work
that
to
be
done
pursued
john
else
can
you
expect
the
old
uns
have
to
give
way
of
course
let
beg
let
starve
what
use
are
they
hewett
had
put
a
kettle
on
the
fire
and
began
to
arrange
the
table
for
a
meal
an
get
your
wet
things
off
john
she
said
be
your
rheumatics
again
mind

business

be

an
about

a
good
deal
more
takin
care
of
than
i
do
here
let
amy
get
the
tea
the
three
children
amy
annie
and
tom
had
come
forward
as
only
children
do
who
are
wont
to
be
treated
affectionately
on
their
return
john
had
a
kiss
and
a
caress
for
each
of
them
then
he
stepped
to
the
bed
and
looked
at
his
latest
born
the
baby
was
moaning
feebly
he
spoke
no
word
to
it
and
on
turning
away
glanced
about
the
room
absently
in
the
meantime
his
wife
had
taken
some
clothing
from
a
chest
of
drawers
and
at
length
he
was
persuaded
to
go
into
the
other
room
and
change
when
he
returned
the
meal
was
ready
it
consisted
of
a
scrap
of
cold
steak
left
over
from
yesterday
and
still
upon
the
original
dish
amid
congealed
fat
a
spongy
loaf
that
species
of
baker
bread
of
which
a
great
quantity
can
be
consumed
with
small
effect
on
the
appetite
a
shapeless
piece
of
something
purchased
under
the
name
of
butter
dabbed
into
a
shallow
basin
some
pickled
cabbage
in
a
and
lastly
a
pot
of
tea
made
by
adding
a
teaspoonful
or
two
to
the
saturated
leaves
which
had
already
served
at
breakfast
and
this
repast
was
laid
on
a
very
dirty
cloth
the
cups
were
unmatched
and
chipped
the
knives
were
in
all
stages
of
decrepitude
the
teapot
was
of
dirty
tin
with
a
damaged
spout
sidney
began
to
affect
cheerfulness
he
took
little
annie
on
one
of
his
knees
and
tom
on
the
other
the
mature
amy
presided
hewett
ate
the
morsel
of
meat
evidently
without
thinking
about
it
he
crumbled
a
piece
of
bread
and
munched
mouthfuls
in
silence
of
the
vapid
liquor
called
tea
he
drank
cup
after
cup
the
time
he
asked
at
length
clara
daresay
she
doin
overtime
replied
his
wife
wo
be
much
longer
the
man
was
incapable
of
remaining
in
one
spot
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
now
he
went
to
look
at
the
baby
now
he
stirred
the
fire
now
he
walked
across
the
room
aimlessly
he
was
the
embodiment
of
worry
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
over
amy
annie
and
tom
were
sent
off
to
bed
they
occupied
the
second
room
together
with
clara
bob
shared
the
bed
of
a
upstairs
this
was
great
extravagance
obviously
other
people
would
have
made
two
rooms
sufficient
for
all
and
many
such
families
would
have
put
up
with
one
but
hewett
had
his
ideas
of
decency
and
stuck
to
them
with
characteristic
wilfulness
do
you
think
i
been
this
afternoon
john
began
when
the
three
little
ones
were
gone
and
hewett
had
been
persuaded
to
lie
down
upon
the
bed
to
enfleld
an
back
i
was
told
of
a
job
out
there
but
it
no
good
they
full
up
they
say
exercise
is
good
for
the
i
shall
be
a
man
before
long
it
seems
to
me
what
do
think

been
to
see
corder

asked
sidney
after
reflecting
anxiously
i
have
was
the
angry
reply
what
more
i
ai
to
he
one
o
them
men
i
ca
get
on
with
as
long
as
you

yourself

cryin
for
food
before
i
could
do
it
so
do
speak
to
me
about
corder
again
it
makes
me
wild
sidney
tapped
the
floor
with
his
foot
himself
a
single
man
without
responsibilities
always
in
fairly
good
work
he
could
not
invariably
sympathise
with
hewett
sore
and
impracticable
pride
his
own
temper
did
not
err
in
the
direction
of
meekness
but
as
he
looked
round
the
room
he
felt
that
a
home
such
as
this
would
drive
him
to
any
degree
of
humiliation
john
knew
what
the
young
man
thoughts
were
he
resumed
in
a
voice
of
exasperated
bitterness
i
have
been
to
corder

beg
his
pardon

every
other
shop
in
the
street
what

why
no

but
i
tell
you
that
how
i
felt
if
any
man
had
said
as
much
as
a
rough
word
to
me
i
a
gone
at
him
like
a
bulldog
i
felt
like
a
beast
i
wanted
to
fight
i
tell
you
to
fight
till
the
life
was
kicked
an
throttled
out
of
me
do
do
go
on
in
that
way
cried
his
wife
sobbing
miserably
let
him
go
on
like
that
sidney
hewett
jumped
up
and
walked
about
the
time
he
asked
the
next
moment
and
when
sidney
told
him
that
it
was
nine
he
exclaimed
why
has
clara
come
what
gone
with
her
she
at
tubbs
replied
his
wife
in
a
low
voice
looking
at
kirkwood
what
call
has
she
to
be
there
who
gave
her
leave
to
go
there
there
was
another
exchange
of
looks
between
sidney
and
hewett
then
the
latter
with
hesitation
and
timidity
told
of
tubbs
visit
to
her
that
evening
and
of
the
proposals
the
woman
had
made
wo
hear
of
it
cried
john
wo
have
my
girl
go
for
a
barmaid
so
there
an
end
of
it
i
tell
you
she
sha
go
can
understand
you
hewett
said
sidney
in
a
tone
of
argument
softened
by
deference
do
you
think
you
better
make
a
few
inquiries
at
all
events
you
see
it
is
exactly
a
barmaid
place
i
mean
to
say
tubbs
does
keep
a
where
people
stand
about
drinking
all
day
it
is
only
a
and
respectable
enough
john
turned
and
regarded
him
with
astonishment
i
thought
you
was
as
much
set
against
it
as
me
what
made
you
come
round
like
this
i
you
got
tired
of
her
an
that
made
you
so
you
do
care
the
young
man
eyes
flashed
angrily
but
before
he
could
make
a
rejoinder
hewett
interposed
shame
o
yourself
john
if
you
ca
talk
better
sense
than
that
do
talk
at
all
he
do
mean
it
sidney
he
half
drove
off
his
head
with
trouble
he
does
think
it
said
kirkwood
speaking
sternly
but
with
him
say
what
he
likes
he
ca
say
worse
than
i
should
deserve
there
was
an
instant
of
silence
hewett
head
hung
with
more
than
the
usual
doggedness
then
he
addressed
sidney
sullenly
but
in
a
tone
which
admitted
his
error
have
you
got
to
say
never
mind
me
i
only
the
girl
father
an
there
not
much
heed
paid
to
fathers
nowadays
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
clara
if
you
changed
your
mind
about
her
goin
there
just
tell
me
why
sidney
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
at
once
but
an
appealing
look
from
hewett
decided
him
here
hewett
he
began
with
blunt
earnestness
if
any
harm
came
to
clara
i
should
feel
it
every
bit
as
much
as
you
and
that
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
all
the
same
what
i
got
to
say
is
this
let
her
go
to
tubbs
for
a
month
trial
if
you
persist
in
refusing
her
mark
my
words
you
be
sorry
i
thought
it
all
over
and
i
know
what
i
talking
about
the
girl
ca
put
up
with
the
work
room
any
longer
it
ruining
her
health
for
one
thing
anybody
can
see
that
and
it
making
her
so
discontented
she
soon
get
reckless
i
understand
your
feeling
well
enough
but
i
understand
her
as
well
at
all
events
i
believe
i
do
she
wants
a
change
getting
tired
of
her
very
life
well
cried
the
father
in
shrill
irritation
does
she
take
the
change
that
offered
to
her
she
no
need
to
go
neither
to
workroom
nor
to
bar
there
a
good
home
waiting
for
her
is
there
what
come
to
the
girl
she
used
to
go
on
as
if
she
liked
you
well
enough
girl
alters
a
deal
between
fifteen
and
seventeen
sidney
replied
forcing
himself
to
speak
with
an
air
of
calmness
of
impartiality
was
old
enough
to
know
her
own
mind
i
tired
of
plaguing
her
i
feel
ashamed
to
say
another
word
to
her
and
that
the
truth
she
only
gets
more
and
more
set
against
me
if
it
ever
to
come
right
have
to
be
by
waiting
we
wo
talk
about
that
any
more
think
of
her
quite
apart
from
me
and
what
i
been
hoping
she
seventeen
years
old
you
ca
deal
with
a
girl
of
that
age
like
you
can
with
amy
and
annie
you
have
to
trust
her
hewett
you
have
to
because
there
no
help
for
it
we
working
people
we
are
we
the
lower
orders
our
girls
have
to
go
out
and
get
their
livings
we
teach
them
the
best
we
can
and
the
devil
knows
they
got
examples
enough
of
misery
and
ruin
before
their
eyes
to
help
them
to
keep
straight
rich
people
can
take
care
of
their
daughters
as
much
as
they
like
they
can
treat
them
like
children
till
they
married
people
of
our
kind
do
that
and
it
has
to
be
faced
john
sat
with
dark
brow
his
eyes
staring
on
vacancy
right
what
sidney
says
father
put
in
hewett
help
it
may
perhaps
have
done
harm
when
you
meant
only
to
do
good
pursued
sidney
being
so
anxious
and
showing
what
account
you
make
of
her
perhaps
you
led
her
to
think
a
little
too
much
of
herself
she
knows
other
fathers
do
go
on
in
that
way
and
now
she
wants
more
freedom
she
feels
it
worse
than
other
girls
do
when
you
begin
to
deny
her
talk
to
her
in
a
different
way
talk
as
if
you
trusted
her
depend
upon
it
it
the
only
hold
you
have
upon
her
do
be
so
much
afraid
clara
has
her
faults
i
see
them
as
well
as
any
one
but
i
never
believe
she
darken
your
life
of
her
own
free
will
there
was
an
unevenness
a
jerky
vehemence
in
his
voice
which
told
how
difficult
it
was
for
him
to
take
this
side
in
argument
he
often
hesitated
obviously
seeking
phrases
which
should
do
least
injury
to
the
father
feelings
the
expression
of
pain
on
his
forehead
and
about
his
lips
testified
to
the
sincerity
with
which
he
urged
his
views
at
the
same
time
to
a
lurking
fear
lest
impulse
should
be
misleading
him
hewett
kept
silence
in
aspect
as
far
as
ever
from
yielding
of
a
sudden
he
raised
his
hand
and
said
there
was
a
familiar
step
on
the
stairs
then
the
door
opened
and
admitted
clara
the
girl
could
not
but
be
aware
that
the
conversation
she
interrupted
had
reference
to
herself
her
father
gazed
fixedly
at
her
sidney
glanced
towards
her
with
and
at
once
averted
his
eyes
hewett
examined
her
with
apprehension
having
carelessly
closed
the
door
with
a
push
she
placed
her
umbrella
in
the
corner
and
began
to
unbutton
her
gloves
her
attitude
was
one
of
affected
unconcern
she
held
her
head
stiffly
and
let
her
eyes
wander
to
the
farther
end
of
the
room
the
expression
of
her
face
was
cold
preoccupied
she
bit
her
lower
lip
so
that
the
under
part
of
it
protruded
have
you
been
clara
her
father
asked
she
did
not
answer
immediately
but
finished
drawing
off
her
gloves
and
rolled
them
up
by
turning
one
over
the
other
then
she
said
indifferently
been
to
see
mrs
tubbs
who
gave
you
leave
asked
hewett
with
irritation
do
see
that
i
needed
any
leave
i
knew
she
was
coming
here
to
speak
to
you
or
mother
so
i
went
after
work
to
ask
what
you
said
she
was
not
above
the
middle
stature
of
women
but
her
slimness
and
erectness
and
the
kind
of
costume
she
wore
made
her
seem
tall
as
she
stood
in
this
room
her
features
were
of
very
uncommon
type
at
once
sensually
attractive
and
bearing
the
stamp
of
intellectual
vigour
the
profile
was
cold
subtle
original
in
full
face
her
high
cheekbones
and
the
heavy
almost
horizontal
line
of
her
eyebrows
were
the
points
that
first
drew
attention
conveying
an
idea
of
force
of
character
the
eyes
themselves
were
and
whatever
her
mood
preserved
a
singular
pathos
of
expression
a
look
as
of
of
unconscious
appeal
against
some
injustice
in
contrast
with
this
her
lips
were
defiant
insolent
unscrupulous
a
shadow
of
the
naivete
of
childhood
still
lingered
upon
them
but
though
you
divined
the
earlier
pout
of
the
spoilt
girl
you
felt
that
it
must
have
foretold
this
in
the
mature
woman
such
cast
of
countenance
could
belong
only
to
one
who
intensified
in
her
personality
an
inheritance
of
revolt
who
combining
the
temper
of
an
ambitious
woman
with
the
forces
of
a
man
brain
had
early
learnt
that
the
world
was
not
her
friend
nor
the
world
law
her
clothing
made
but
poor
protection
against
the
rigours
of
a
london
winter
its
peculiarity
bearing
in
mind
her
position
was
the
lack
of
any
pretended
elegance
a
short
jacket
of
plain
cloth
made
evident
the
grace
of
her
bust
beneath
was
a
brown
dress
with
one
row
of
kilting
she
wore
a
hat
of
brown
felt
the
crown
rising
from
back
to
front
the
narrow
brim
closely
turned
up
all
round
the
high
collar
of
the
jacket
alone
sheltered
her
neck
her
gloves
though
worn
were
obviously
of
good
kid
her
boots
strangest
thing
of
all
in
a
daily
attire
were
both
strong
and
shapely
this
simplicity
seemed
a
declaration
that
she
could
not
afford
genuine
luxuries
and
scorned
to
deck
herself
with
shams
the
manner
of
her
reply
inflamed
hewett
with
impotent
wrath
he
smote
the
table
violently
then
sprang
up
and
flung
his
chair
aside
that
the
way
you
learnt
to
speak
to
your
father
he
shouted
i
told
you
you
not
to
go
nowhere
without
my
leave
or
your
mother
do
you
pay
no
heed
to
what
i
bid
you
if
so
say
it
say
it
at
once
and
have
done
with
it
clara
was
quietly
removing
her
hat
in
doing
so
she
disclosed
the
one
thing
which
gave
proof
of
regard
for
personal
appearance
her
hair
was
elaborately
dressed
drawn
up
from
the
neck
it
was
disposed
in
thick
plaits
upon
the
top
of
her
head
in
front
were
a
few
rows
of
crisping
she
affected
to
be
quite
unaware
that
words
had
been
spoken
to
her
and
stood
smoothing
each
side
of
her
forehead
john
strode
forward
and
laid
his
hands
roughly
upon
her
shoulders
at
me
will
you
speak
will
you
clara
jerked
herself
from
his
grasp
and
regarded
him
with
insolent
surprise
of
fear
there
was
no
trace
upon
her
countenance
she
seemed
to
experience
only
astonishment
at
such
unwonted
behaviour
from
her
father
and
resentment
on
her
own
behalf
sidney
kirkwood
had
risen
and
advanced
a
step
or
two
as
if
in
apprehension
of
harm
to
the
girl
but
his
interference
was
unneeded
hewett
recovered
his
as
soon
as
clara
repelled
him
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
laid
a
hand
upon
one
of
his
children
other
than
gently
his
exasperation
came
of
nerves
of
the
experiences
he
had
gone
through
in
search
of
work
that
day
and
the
keen
suffering
occasioned
by
his
argument
with
sidney
the
practical
confirmation
of
sidney
warning
that
he
must
no
longer
hope
to
control
clara
like
a
child
stung
him
too
poignantly
he
obeyed
an
unreasoning
impulse
to
recover
his
authority
by
force
the
girl
look
entered
his
heart
like
a
stab
she
had
never
faced
him
like
this
before
saying
more
plainly
than
with
words
that
she
defied
him
to
control
her
his
child
face
the
face
he
loved
best
of
all
yet
at
this
moment
he
was
searching
it
vainly
for
the
lineaments
that
were
familiar
to
him
something
had
changed
her
had
hardened
her
against
him
in
a
moment
it
seemed
impossible
that
there
should
come
such
severance
between
them
john
revolted
against
it
as
against
all
the
other
natural
laws
that
visited
him
harshly
come
to
you
my
girl
he
said
in
a
thick
voice
wrong
between
us
clara
have
i
always
done
my
best
for
you
if
i
was
the
worst
enemy
you
had
you
could
look
at
me
crueller
think
it
me
that
should
ask
what
come
to
father
she
returned
with
her
former
treat
me
as
if
i
was
a
baby
i
want
to
know
what
you
going
to
say
about
tubbs
i
suppose
mother
told
you
what
she
offers
me
sidney
had
not
resumed
his
chair
before
hewett
could
reply
he
said
think
i
leave
you
to
talk
over
this
alone
stay
where
you
are
said
john
gruffly
here
clara
sidney
been
talkin
to
me
he
been
sayin
that
i
ought
to
let
you
have
your
own
way
in
this
yes
you
may
well
look
as
if
it
surprised
you
clara
had
just
glanced
at
the
young
man
slightly
raising
her
eyebrows
but
at
once
looked
away
again
with
a
careless
movement
of
the
head
says
what
it
hard
an
cruel
for
me
to
believe
though
i
half
begin
to
see
that
he
right
he
says
you
wo
pay
no
more
heed
to
what
wish
an
it
me
now
must
give
way
to
you
i
did
use
to
think
me
an
clara
would
come
to
that
but
it
looks
like
it
it
looks
like
it
the
girl
stood
with
downcast
eyes
once
more
her
face
had
suffered
a
change
the
lips
were
no
longer
malignant
her
forehead
had
relaxed
from
its
haughty
frown
the
past
fortnight
had
been
a
period
of
contest
between
her
father
stubborn
fears
and
her
own
determination
to
change
the
mode
of
her
life
her
was
only
intensified
by
opposition
john
had
often
enough
experienced
this
but
hitherto
the
points
at
issue
had
been
trifles
matters
in
which
the
father
could
yield
for
the
sake
of
pleasing
his
child
serious
resistance
brought
out
for
the
first
time
all
the
selfish
forces
of
her
nature
she
was
prepared
to
go
all
lengths
rather
than
submit
now
the
question
of
her
liberty
had
once
been
broached
already
there
was
a
plan
in
her
mind
for
quitting
home
regardless
of
all
the
misery
she
would
cause
reckless
of
what
future
might
be
in
store
for
herself
but
the
first
sign
of
yielding
on
her
father
part
touched
the
gentler
elements
of
her
nature
thus
was
she
constituted
merciless
in
egotism
when
put
to
the
use
of
all
her
weapons
moved
to
warmest
gratitude
as
soon
as
concession
was
made
to
her
to
be
on
ill
terms
with
her
father
had
caused
her
pain
the
only
effect
of
which
however
was
to
heighten
the
sullen
impracticability
of
her
temper
at
the
first
glimpse
of
relief
from
overstrained
emotions
she
desired
that
all
angry
feeling
should
be
at
an
end
having
gained
her
point
she
could
once
more
be
the
affectionately
wilful
girl
whose
love
was
the
first
necessity
of
john
existence
john
pursued
reading
her
features
eagerly
say
no
more
about
that
and
i
wo
stand
in
the
way
of
what
you
set
your
mind
on
but
understand
clara
my
girl
it
because
sidney
persuaded
me
sidney
answers
for
it
mind
you
that
his
voice
trembled
and
he
looked
at
the
young
man
with
something
like
anger
in
his
eyes
willing
to
do
that
hewett
said
kirkwood
in
a
low
but
firm
voice
his
eyes
turned
away
from
clara
human
being
can
answer
for
another
in
the
real
meaning
of
the
word
but
i
take
upon
myself
to
say
that
clara
will
bring
you
no
sorrow
she
hears
me
say
it
they
not
the
kind
of
words
that
a
man
speaks
without
thought
of
what
they
mean
clara
had
seated
herself
by
the
table
and
was
moving
a
finger
along
the
pattern
of
the
dirty
white
cloth
she
bit
her
in
the
manner
already
described
seemingly
her
habit
when
she
wished
to
avoid
any
marked
expression
of
countenance
ca
see
what
kirkwood
got
to
do
with
it
at
all
she
said
with
indifference
which
now
however
was
rather
than
the
reverse
sure
i
do
want
anybody
to
answer
for
a
slight
toss
of
the
head
have
let
me
go
in
any
case
father
so
i
do
see
you
need
bring
kirkwood
name
in
hewett
turned
away
to
the
fireplace
and
hung
his
head
sidney
gazing
darkly
at
the
girl
saw
her
look
towards
him
and
she
smiled
the
strange
effect
of
that
smile
upon
her
features
it
gave
gentleness
to
the
mouth
and
by
making
more
manifest
the
intelligent
light
of
her
eyes
emphasised
the
singular
pathos
inseparable
from
their
regard
it
was
a
smile
to
which
a
man
would
concede
anything
which
would
vanquish
every
prepossession
which
would
inspire
pity
and
tenderness
and
devotion
in
the
heart
of
sternest
resentment
sidney
knew
its
power
only
too
well
he
averted
his
face
then
clara
rose
again
and
said
shall
just
walk
round
and
tell
tubbs
it
is
late
and
like
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
surely
it
do
in
the
mornin
exclaimed
hewett
who
had
followed
the
conversation
in
silent
anxiety
clara
paid
no
attention
but
at
once
put
on
her
hat
again
then
she
said
wo
be
long
father
and
moved
towards
the
door
hewett
did
not
look
round
you
let
me
walk
part
of
the
way
with
you
sidney
asked
abruptly
if
you
like
he
bade
the
two
who
remained
and
followed
clara
downstairs
chapter
iv
clara
and
jane
rain
no
longer
fell
but
the
gusty
and
bitter
wind
still
swept
about
the
black
streets
walking
side
by
side
without
speech
clara
and
her
companion
left
the
neighbourhood
of
the
prison
and
kept
a
northward
direction
till
they
reached
the
junction
of
highways
where
stands
the
here
was
the
wonted
crowd
of
loiterers
and
the
press
of
people
waiting
for
tramcar
or
omnibus
east
west
south
or
north
newsboys
eager
to
get
rid
of
their
last
batch
were
crying
as
usual
exteree
speciul
steendard
and
a
brass
band
was
blaring
out
its
saddest
strain
of
merry
the
lights
gleamed
dismally
in
and
on
the
wet
pavement
with
the
wind
came
whiffs
of
tobacco
and
odours
of
the
they
crossed
and
walked
the
length
of
islington
high
street
then
a
short
way
along
its
continuation
upper
street
once
or
twice
clara
had
barely
glanced
at
kirkwood
but
his
eyes
made
no
reply
and
his
lips
were
resolutely
closed
she
did
not
seem
offended
by
this
silence
on
the
contrary
her
face
was
cheerful
and
she
smiled
to
herself
now
and
then
one
would
have
imagined
that
she
found
pleasure
in
the
sombreness
of
which
she
was
the
cause
she
stopped
at
length
and
said
suppose
you
do
want
to
go
in
with
me
i
say
thank
you
for
coming
so
far
out
of
your
way
wait
i
may
as
well
walk
back
with
you
if
you
do
mind
very
well
i
sha
be
many
minutes
she
passed
on
and
entered
the
place
of
refreshment
that
was
kept
by
tubbs
till
recently
it
had
been
an
ordinary
or
but
having
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
license
to
sell
strong
liquors
tubbs
had
converted
the
establishment
into
one
of
a
more
pretentious
kind
she
called
it
restaurant
and
luncheon
bar
the
front
shone
with
vermilion
paint
the
interior
was
aflare
with
many
in
the
window
was
disposed
a
tempting
exhibition
of
of
fish
cold
roast
fowls
and
the
like
whilst
farther
back
stood
a
whereon
frizzled
and
vapoured
a
savoury
mess
of
sausages
and
onions
sidney
turned
away
a
few
paces
the
inclemency
of
the
night
made
upper
street
the
promenade
of
a
great
district
on
account
of
its
spacious
pavement
less
frequented
than
usual
but
there
were
still
numbers
of
people
about
some
hastening
homewards
some
sauntering
hither
and
thither
in
the
familiar
way
some
gathered
into
gossiping
groups
kirkwood
was
irritated
by
the
conversation
and
laughter
that
fell
on
his
ears
irritated
by
the
distant
strains
of
the
band
irritated
above
all
by
the
fume
of
frying
that
pervaded
the
air
for
many
yards
about
tubbs
precincts
he
observed
that
the
customers
tending
that
way
were
numerous
they
consisted
mainly
of
lads
and
young
men
who
had
come
forth
from
neighbouring
places
of
entertainment
the
locality
and
its
characteristics
had
been
familiar
to
him
from
youth
upwards
but
his
nature
was
not
subdued
to
what
it
worked
in
and
the
present
fit
of
disgust
was
only
an
accentuation
of
a
mood
by
which
he
was
often
possessed
to
the
hewetts
he
had
spoken
impartially
of
tubbs
and
her
bar
probably
that
was
the
right
view
but
now
there
came
back
upon
him
the
repugnance
with
which
he
had
regarded
clara
proposal
when
it
was
first
made
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
waited
nearly
half
an
hour
when
clara
came
forth
again
in
silence
she
walked
on
beside
him
again
they
crossed
by
the
and
entered
john
street
road
made
your
arrangements
sidney
said
now
that
there
were
few
people
passing
i
shall
go
on
monday
going
to
live
there
altogether
it
be
more
convenient
and
then
it
give
them
more
room
at
home
bob
can
sleep
with
the
children
and
save
money
be
sure
observed
the
young
man
with
bitter
irony
clara
flashed
a
glance
at
him
it
was
a
new
thing
for
sidney
to
take
this
tone
with
her
not
seldom
he
had
expressed
unfavourable
judgments
by
silence
but
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
otherwise
than
with
deference
and
gentleness
do
seem
in
a
very
good
temper
mr
kirkwood
she
remarked
in
a
suave
tone
he
disregarded
her
words
but
in
a
few
moments
turned
upon
her
and
said
scornfully
hope
you
enjoy
the
pleasant
ladylike
work
you
found
i
should
think
it
improve
your
to
wait
on
the
gentlemen
of
upper
street
irony
is
not
a
weapon
much
in
use
among
working
people
their
wits
in
general
are
too
slow
with
sidney
however
it
had
always
been
a
habit
of
speech
in
indignant
criticism
and
sympathy
made
him
aware
that
nothing
would
sting
clara
more
acutely
he
saw
that
he
was
successful
when
she
turned
her
head
away
and
moved
it
nervously
do
you
suppose
i
go
there
because
the
place
pleases
me
she
asked
in
a
cold
hostile
voice
make
a
great
mistake
as
you
always
do
when
you
pretend
to
know
anything
about
me
wait
till
i
learned
a
little
about
the
business
you
wo
find
me
in
upper
street
then
understand
again
they
walked
on
in
silence
they
were
nearing
clerkenwell
close
and
had
to
pass
a
corner
of
the
prison
in
a
dark
lane
where
the
wind
moaned
drearily
the
line
of
the
high
blank
wall
was
relieved
in
colourless
gloom
against
a
sky
of
sheer
night
opposite
the
shapes
of
houses
and
grimy
workshops
stood
huddling
in
the
obscurity
from
near
at
hand
came
shrill
voices
of
children
chasing
each
other
about
children
playing
at
midnight
between
slum
and
gaol
not
likely
to
see
much
of
each
other
after
said
sidney
stopping
less
the
better
i
should
say
if
this
is
how
you
going
to
talk
to
me
less
the
better
perhaps
at
all
events
for
a
time
but
one
or
two
things
on
my
mind
and
i
say
them
now
i
do
know
whether
you
think
anything
about
it
but
you
must
have
seen
that
things
are
getting
worse
and
worse
at
home
your
mother
no
mother
of
mine
broke
in
clara
angrily
been
a
mother
to
you
in
kindness
that
certain
and
repaid
her
almost
as
ill
as
you
could
have
done
another
girl
would
have
made
her
hard
life
a
bit
easier
no
you
only
thought
of
yourself
your
father
walks
about
day
after
day
trying
to
get
work
and
how
do
you
meet
him
when
he
comes
home
you
fret
him
and
anger
him
you
throw
him
back
words
when
he
happens
to
think
different
from
you
you
almost
break
his
heart
because
you
wo
give
way
in
things
that
he
only
means
for
your
good
he
that
would
give
his
life
for
you
it
as
well
you
should
hear
the
truth
for
once
and
hear
it
from
me
too
anyone
else
might
speak
from
all
sorts
of
motives
as
for
me
it
makes
me
suffer
more
to
say
such
things
than
it
ever
could
you
to
hear
them
laugh
if
you
like
i
do
ask
you
to
pay
any
heed
to
what
wished
and
hoped
but
just
give
a
thought
to
your
father
and
the
rest
of
them
at
home
i
told
him
he
only
to
trust
you
that
you
never
could
do
anything
to
make
him
ashamed
of
you
i
said
so
and
i
believe
it
look
clara
with
all
my
heart
i
believe
it
but
now
you
got
your
way
think
of
them
a
little
is
your
fault
if
i
do
know
how
bad
i
am
said
the
girl
with
a
that
she
did
not
resent
his
lecture
more
decidedly
was
no
doubt
due
to
its
having
afforded
new
proof
of
the
power
she
had
over
him
sidney
was
shaken
with
emotion
his
voice
all
but
failed
him
at
the
last
he
said
turning
away
clara
hesitated
looked
at
him
but
finally
also
said
and
went
on
alone
she
walked
with
bent
head
and
almost
passed
the
in
absence
of
thought
on
the
threshold
was
standing
miss
peckover
she
drew
aside
to
let
clara
pass
between
these
two
was
a
singular
rivalry
though
by
date
a
year
younger
than
clara
clem
gave
no
evidence
of
being
physically
less
mature
in
the
matter
of
personal
charms
she
regarded
herself
as
by
far
miss
hewett
superior
and
resented
vigorously
the
tone
of
the
latter
behaviour
to
her
clara
on
the
other
hand
looked
down
upon
miss
peckover
as
a
mere
vulgar
girl
she
despised
her
brother
bob
because
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
inveigled
by
clem
in
intellect
in
social
standing
she
considered
herself
out
of
all
comparison
with
the
landlady
daughter
clem
had
the
obvious
advantage
of
being
able
to
ridicule
the
hewetts
poverty
and
did
so
without
sparing
now
for
instance
when
clara
was
about
to
pass
with
a
distant
clem
remarked
cold
ai
it
i
wonder
you
do
put
on
a
ulster
a
night
like
this
you
was
the
reply
sha
consult
you
about
how
i
to
dress
clem
laughed
knowing
she
had
the
best
of
the
joke
the
other
went
upstairs
and
entered
the
where
it
was
quite
dark
you
clara
asked
amy
voice
candle
on
the
are
you
asleep
clara
returned
sharply
but
the
irritation
induced
by
clem
triumph
quickly
passed
in
reflection
on
sidney
mode
of
that
had
not
at
all
annoyed
her
but
it
had
made
her
thoughtful
she
lit
the
candle
its
light
disclosed
a
room
much
barer
than
the
other
one
there
was
one
bed
in
which
amy
and
annie
lay
clara
had
to
share
it
with
them
and
a
mattress
placed
on
the
floor
where
reposed
little
tom
a
low
chest
of
drawers
with
a
very
small
upon
it
a
washstand
a
few
boxes
handsome
girls
unfortunate
enough
to
have
brains
to
boot
do
not
cultivate
the
patient
virtues
in
chambers
of
this
description
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
clara
found
her
father
standing
there
you
anything
to
tell
me
my
girl
he
asked
in
a
subdued
voice
furtively
regarding
her
shall
go
on
monday
he
drew
back
a
step
and
seemed
about
to
return
to
the
other
room
i
shall
have
to
give
tubbs
the
five
shillings
for
a
few
weeks
she
going
to
let
me
have
a
new
dress
earnin
is
your
own
clara
but
i
hope
very
soon
to
be
able
to
give
you
something

hard
for
you
having
no
work
john
brightened
wonderfully
you
trouble
my
dear
that
all
right
things
come
round
somehow
you
a
good
girl
my
darlin
he
kissed
her
and
went
consoled
to
his
rest
miss
peckover
kept
going
up
and
down
between
the
kitchen
and
the
down
below
jane
was
cleaning
a
copper
kettle
clem
who
had
her
sweetest
morsel
of
cruelty
yet
in
store
had
devised
this
pleasant
little
job
as
a
way
of
keeping
the
child
employed
till
all
was
quiet
she
had
just
come
down
to
watch
the
progress
of
the
work
and
to
give
a
smart
rap
or
two
on
the
toiling
fingers
when
a
heavy
footstep
in
the
passage
caused
her
to
dart
upstairs
again
it
was
bob
hewett
returned
from
his
evening
recreations
that
you
is
it
cried
clem
down
i
want
to
speak
to
you
till
answered
bob
advancing
towards
the
stairs
we
see
about
that
she
sprang
forward
and
with
a
prompt
exertion
of
muscle
admirable
in
its
way
whirled
bob
round
and
dragged
him
to
the
head
of
the
kitchen
flight
the
young
fellow
took
it
in
good
part
and
went
down
with
her
go
up
into
the
passage
said
clem
to
her
servant
and
was
immediately
obeyed
resumed
miss
peckover
when
she
had
closed
the
door
have
you
been
goin
about
with
are
you
talking
about
returned
bob
who
had
seated
himself
on
the
table
and
was
regarding
clem
jocosely
been
with
some
pals
that
all
what
sort
o
pals
do
you
call
pennyloaf
candy
one
o
your
pals
she
stood
before
him
in
a
superb
attitude
her
head
poised
fiercely
her
arms
quivering
at
her
sides
all
the
stature
and
vigour
of
her
young
body
emphasised
by
muscular
strain
candy
bob
repeated
as
if
in
scorn
of
the
person
so
named
on
with
you
i
sick
of
hearing
you
talk
about
her
why
i
seen
her
not
these
three
weeks
a
lie
clem
epithet
was
too
vigorous
for
reproduction
jollop
saw

her
down
by
the
an
jeck
bartley

he
laughed
with
obstreperous
scorn
jeck

to
homerton

i
see
her
next
i
make
her
go
down
on
her
an
beg
my
pardon
see
if
i
do
just
there
was
an
engaging
frankness
in
bob
way
of
defending
himself
which
evidently
impressed
miss
peckover
though
it
did
not
immediately
soothe
her
irritation
she
put
her
arms
and
examined
him
with
a
steady
suspicion
which
would
have
disconcerted
most
young
men
bob
however
only
laughed
more
heartily
the
scene
was
prolonged
bob
had
no
recourse
to
tenderness
to
dismiss
the
girl
jealousy
his
was
supreme
and
had
always
stood
him
in
such
stead
with
the
young
ladies
who
to
use
his
own
expression
were
nuts
on
him
that
his
under
whatever
circumstances
always
took
the
form
of
genial
banter
haut
en
be
a
bloomin
fool
was
the
phrase
he
deemed
of
most
efficacy
in
softening
the
female
heart
and
the
result
seemed
to
justify
him
for
after
some
wrangling
clem
abandoned
her
hostile
attitude
and
eyed
him
with
a
savage
kind
of
admiration
are
you
goin
to
buy
me
that
locket
bob
to
put
a
bit
of
your
in
she
inquired
pertinently
just
wait
ca
you

event

say
nothing
but
you
just
wait
tired
o
waitin
see
here
you
ai
goin
to
best
me
out
of
it
best
you
do
be
a
bloomin
fool
clem
he
laughed
heartily
and
in
a
few
minutes
allowed
himself
to
be
embraced
and
sent
off
to
his
chamber
at
the
top
of
the
house
clem
summoned
her
servant
from
the
passage
at
the
same
moment
there
entered
another
lodger
the
only
one
whose
arrival
clem
still
awaited
his
mode
of
ascending
the
stairs
was
singular
one
would
have
imagined
that
he
bore
some
heavy
weight
for
he
proceeded
very
slowly
with
a
great
clumping
noise
surmounting
one
step
at
a
time
in
the
manner
of
a
child
it
was
marple
the
and
his
way
of
going
up
to
bed
was
very
simply
explained
by
the
fact
that
a
daily
sixteen
hours
of
sitting
on
the
box
left
his
legs
in
a
numb
and
practically
useless
condition
the
house
was
now
quiet
clem
locked
the
and
returned
to
the
kitchen
eager
with
anticipation
of
the
jest
she
was
going
to
carry
out
first
of
all
she
had
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
jane
this
was
very
easily
managed
she
pretended
to
look
about
the
room
for
a
minute
then
asked
fiercely
gone
with
that
sixpence
i
left
on
the
dresser
jane
looked
up
in
terror
she
was
worn
almost
to
the
last
point
of
endurance
by
her
day
and
night
of
labour
and
agitation
her
face
was
bloodless
her
eyelids
were
swollen
with
the
need
of
sleep
she
faltered
sure
i
have
seen
no
sixpence
miss
have
now
i
caught
you
at
last
there
been
nobody
but
you
little
thief
we
see
about
this
in
the
mornin
shall
sleep
in
the
the
child
gasped
for
breath
the
terror
of
sudden
death
could
not
have
exceeded
that
which
rushed
upon
her
heart
when
she
was
told
that
she
must
pass
her
night
in
the
room
where
lay
the
coffin
you
sha
have
no
candle
neither
proceeded
clem
delighted
with
the
effect
she
was
producing
along
i
off
to
bed
i
see
you
safe
locked
in
first
so
as
no
one
can
come

hurt

i
ca
i
durst
jane
pleaded
in
inarticulate
anguish
but
clem
had
caught
her
by
the
arm
was
dragging
her
on
on
till
she
was
at
the
very
door
of
that
ghastly
though
thirteen
years
old
her
slight
frame
was
as
incapable
of
resisting
clem
peckover
muscles
as
an
infant
would
have
been
the
door
was
open
but
at
that
moment
jane
uttered
a
shriek
which
rang
and
echoed
through
the
whole
house
startled
clem
relaxed
her
grasp
jane
tore
herself
away
fled
up
the
kitchen
stairs
fled
upwards
still
flung
herself
at
the
feet
of
someone
who
had
come
out
on
to
the
landing
and
held
a
light
help
me
do
let
her
help
me
up
with
you
jane
asked
clara
for
it
was
she
who
not
being
yet
in
bed
had
come
forth
at
once
on
hearing
the
scream
jane
could
only
cling
to
her
garment
pant
hysterically
repeat
the
same
words
of
entreaty
again
and
again
another
door
opened
and
john
hewett
appeared
wrong
he
cried
o
fire
who
yelled
out
like
that
clem
was
coming
up
she
spoke
from
the
landing
below
that
jane
just
because
i
gave
her
a
rap
as
she
deserved
send
her
down
again
no
cried
the
poor
girl

goin
to
shut
me
up
all
night
with
the
coffin
do
let
her
miss
i
durst
oh

a
friend

me
liar
shouted
clem
that
bloomin
little
liar
when
i
never
said
a
word
o
such
a
thing
believe
her
a
good
deal
sooner
than
you
returned
clara
sharply
anybody
can
see
she
tellin
the
truth
ca
they
father
she
out
of
her
life
come
in
here
jane
you
shall
stay
here
till
morning
by
this
time
all
the
people
in
the
house
were
on
the
staircase
the
clang
of
tongues
was
terrific
clem
held
her
ground
stoutly
and
in
virulence
was
more
than
a
match
for
all
her
opponents
even
bob
did
not
venture
to
take
her
part
he
grinned
down
over
the
banisters
and
enjoyed
the
entertainment
immensely
dick
snape
whose
room
bob
shared
took
the
opportunity
of
paying
off
certain
old
scores
he
had
standing
against
clem
marple
the
was
very
loud
and
very
hoarse
in
condemnation
of
such
barbarity
hewett
looking
as
if
she
had
herself
risen
from
a
coffin
cried
shame
on
the
general
heartlessness
with
which
jane
was
used
clara
held
to
her
resolve
she
led
jane
into
the
bedroom
then
with
a
parting
shot
at
miss
peckover
herself
entered
and
locked
the
door
some
water
jane
she
said
doing
her
best
to
reassure
the
child
safe
for
and
we
see
what
peckover
says
about
this
when
she
comes
back
jane
looked
at
her
rescuer
with
eyes
in
which
eternal
gratitude
mingled
with
fear
for
the
future
she
could
cry
now
poor
thing
and
so
little
by
little
recover
herself
words
to
utter
her
thanks
she
had
none
she
could
only
look
something
of
what
she
felt
clara
made
her
undress
and
lie
down
with
little
tom
on
the
mattress
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
candle
was
extinguished
and
but
for
the
wind
which
rattled
sashes
and
doors
and
made
ghostly
sounds
in
the
chimneys
there
was
silence
throughout
the
house
something
awoke
clara
before
dawn
she
sat
up
and
became
aware
that
jane
was
talking
and
crying
wildly
evidently
in
her
sleep
the
scene
of
a
few
hours
ago
with
difficulty
clara
broke
her
slumber
you
feel
well
jane
she
asked
noticing
a
strangeness
in
the
child
way
of
replying
to
her
very
miss
my
head
bad
an
i
so
thirsty
may
i
drink
out
of
the
jug
miss
where
you
are
i
bring
it
to
you
jane
drank
a
great
deal
presently
she
fell
again
into
slumber
which
was
again
broken
in
the
same
way
clara
did
not
go
to
sleep
and
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight
she
summoned
her
father
to
come
and
look
at
the
child
jane
was
ill
and
as
everyone
could
see
rapidly
grew
worse
chapter
v
jane
is
visited
at
ten
next
morning
peckover
reached
home
she
was
a
tall
woman
of
fifty
with
an
arm
like
a
coalheaver
she
had
dark
hair
which
shone
and
was
odorous
with
unguents
a
sallow
uncomely
face
and
a
handsome
moustache
her
countenance
was
more
difficult
to
read
than
clem
a
coarse
and
most
likely
brutal
nature
was
plain
enough
in
its
lines
but
there
was
also
a
suggestion
of
of
sagacity
at
all
events
of
cunning
qualities
which
were
decidedly
not
inherited
by
her
daughter
with
her
came
the
relative
whose
presence
had
been
desired
at
the
funeral
this
was
gully
a
stout
person
with
a
very
red
nose
and
bleared
eyes
the
credit
of
the
family
demanded
that
as
many
relatives
as
possible
should
follow
the
hearse
and
peckover
reason
for
conducting
gully
hither
was
a
justifiable
fear
lest
if
she
came
alone
the
latter
would
arrive
in
too
manifest
a
state
of
insobriety
a
certain
amount
of
stimulant
had
been
permitted
on
the
way
just
enough
to
assist
a
genteel
loquacity
for
which
gully
had
a
reputation
she
had
given
her
word
to
abstain
from
further
imbibing
until
after
the
funeral
the
news
which
greeted
her
arrival
was
anything
but
welcome
to
peckover
in
the
first
place
there
would
be
far
more
work
than
usual
to
be
performed
in
the
house
and
jane
could
be
ill
spared
worse
than
that
however
clara
hewett
who
was
losing
half
a
work
on
jane
account
made
a
very
emphatic
statement
as
to
the
origin
of
the
illness
and
said
that
if
anything
happened
to
jane
there
would
be
disagreeable
facts
forthcoming
at
a
coroner
inquest
having
looked
at
the
sick
child
peckover
went
downstairs
and
shut
herself
up
with
clem
there
was
a
stormy
interview
you
thought
you
have
yer
fling
did
you
just
because
i
you
must
go
makin
trouble
just
to
suit
yer
own
fancies
pay
you
my
lady
whereupon
followed
the
smack
of
a
large
hand
on
a
fleshy
cheek
so
vigorous
and
unexpected
a
blow
that
even
the
sturdy
clem
staggered
back
leave
me
alone
will
you
she
roared
out
her
smitten
cheek
in
a
flame
that
again
an
i
give
you
somethin
for
yerself
see
if
i
do
you
just
try
it
on
the
room
rang
with
uproarious
abuse
with
disgusting
language
with
the
terrific
threats
which
are
such
common
flowers
of
rhetoric
in
that
world
and
generally
mean
nothing
whatever
the
end
of
it
all
was
that
clem
went
to
fetch
a
doctor
one
in
whom
peckover
could
repose
confidence
the
man
was
in
fact
a
druggist
with
a
shop
in
an
obscure
street
over
towards
luke
in
his
window
was
exhibited
a
card
which
stated
that
a
certain
medical
man
could
be
consulted
here
daily
the
said
medical
man
had
in
fact
so
much
more
business
than
he
could
attend
to
his
name
appearing
in
many
shops
that
the
druggist
was
deputed
to
act
as
his
assistant
and
was
considerately
supplied
with
already
signed
and
only
needing
to
be
filled
in
with
details
summoned
by
peckover
whose
old
acquaintance
he
was
the
druggist
left
the
shop
in
care
of
his
son
aged
fifteen
and
sped
to
clerkenwell
close
he
made
light
of
jane
ailment
little
fever
that
was
all
soon
pull
her
round
any
wounds
no
oh
soon
pull
her
round
send
for
medicines
have
her
down
in
the
as
soon
as
the
away
said
peckover
to
hewett
you
upset
yerself
about
it
my
dear
you
got
quite
enough
to
think
about
yer
got
anythink
yet
dear
dear
do
you
put
yerself
out
i
sure
it
was
a
great
kindness
of
you
to
let
the
troublesome
thing
lay
all
night
funeral
guests
were
beginning
to
assemble
on
arriving
they
were
conducted
first
of
all
into
the
on
the
the
peckovers
parlour
it
was
richly
furnished
in
the
centre
stood
a
round
table
which
left
small
space
for
moving
about
and
was
at
present
covered
with
refreshments
a
polished
sideboard
supported
a
row
of
propped
on
their
edges
and
a
number
of
glass
vessels
probably
meant
for
ornament
alone
as
they
could
not
possibly
have
been
put
to
any
use
a
low
cupboard
in
a
recess
was
surmounted
by
a
frosted
cardboard
model
of
paul
under
a
glass
case
behind
which
was
reared
an
oval
tray
painted
with
flowers
over
the
was
the
regulation
mirror
its
gilt
frame
enveloped
in
coarse
yellow
gauze
the
itself
bore
a
of
embellishments
in
glass
and
crockery
on
each
side
of
it
hung
a
framed
silhouette
portraits
of
ancestors
other
pictures
there
were
many
the
most
impressive
being
an
ancient
of
which
the
canvas
bulged
forth
from
the
frame
the
subject
appeared
to
be
a
ship
but
was
just
as
likely
a
view
of
the
alps
several
german
prints
conveyed
instruction
as
well
as
delight
one
represented
the
trial
of
strafford
in
westminster
hall
another
the
trial
of
william
lord
russell
at
the
old
bailey
there
was
also
a
group
of
engraved
portraits
the
royal
family
of
england
early
in
the
reign
of
queen
victoria
and
finally
destruction
of
nineveh
by
john
martin
along
the
were
disposed
containing
artificial
plants
one
or
other
was
always
being
knocked
down
by
the
curtains
or
blinds
each
guest
having
taken
a
quaff
of
ale
or
spirits
or
what
was
called
wine
with
perhaps
a
mouthful
of
more
solid
sustenance
was
then
led
down
into
the
to
view
the
coffin
and
the
corpse
i
mention
the
coffin
first
because
in
everyone
view
this
was
the
main
point
of
interest
could
peckover
have
buried
the
old
woman
in
an
she
would
gladly
have
done
so
for
the
saving
of
expense
but
with
relatives
and
neighbours
to
consider
she
drew
a
great
deal
of
virtue
out
of
necessity
and
dealt
so
very
handsomely
with
the
undertaker
that
this
burial
would
be
the
talk
of
the
close
for
some
weeks
the
coffin
was
inspected
inside
and
out
was
admired
and
appraised
peckover
being
at
hand
to
check
the
estimates
at
the
same
time
every
most
revolting
detail
of
the
dead
woman
last
illness
was
related
and
discussed
and
mused
over
and
exclaimed
upon
lovely
corpse
considerin
her
years
was
the
general
opinion
then
all
went
upstairs
again
and
once
more
refreshed
themselves
the
house
smelt
like
a
most
respectable
i
sure
remarked
the
female
mourners
to
each
other
as
they
crowded
together
in
the
parlour
so
it
had
ought
to
be
exclaimed
one
in
an
indignant
tone
such
as
is
reserved
for
the
expression
of
offence
among
educated
people
but
among
the
poor
the
london
poor
least
original
and
least
articulate
beings
within
the
confines
of
civilisation
has
also
to
do
duty
for
friendly
emphasis
peckover
ca
afford
to
do
things
respectable

the
speaker
looked
defiantly
about
her
as
if
daring
contradiction
but
only
approving
murmurs
replied
peckover
had
in
fact
the
reputation
of
being
wealthy
she
was
always
inheriting
always
accumulating
what
her
friends
called
never
expending
as
other
people
needs

the
lodgings
she
let

her
to
live
and
clem
earnings
at
an
factory
more
than
paid
for
that
young
lady
board
and
clothing
and
all
other
outlay
was
not
worth
mentioning
as
a
deduction
from
the
income
created
by
her
sundry
investments
her
husband
ten
years
deceased
had
been
a
he
earned
on
an
average
between
three
and
four
pounds
a
week
and
was
so
prudently
disposed
that
for
the
last
decade
of
his
life
he
made
it
a
rule
never
to
spend
a
farthing
of
his
wages
peckover
at
that
time
kept
a
small
in
rosoman
street
small
and
unpretending
in
appearance
but
through
it
there
ran
a
beery
pactolus
by
selling
the
business
shortly
after
her
death
peckover
realised
a
handsome
capital
she
retired
into
private
life
having
a
strong
sense
of
personal
dignity
and
feeling
it
necessary
to
devote
herself
to
the
moral
training
of
her
only
child
at
eleven
peckover
was
arrayed
in
her
mourning
robes
new
during
her
absence
clem
had
kept
guard
over
gully
whom
it
was
very
difficult
indeed
to
restrain
from
the
bottles
and
decanters
the
elder
lady
coming
to
relieve
clem
could
rush
away
and
don
her
own
solemn
garments
the
undertaker
with
his
men
arrived
the
hearse
and
coaches
drove
up
the
close
was
in
a
state
of
excitement
that
what
i
call
a
respectable
was
the
phrase
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
in
the
crowd
gathering
near
the
door
children
in
great
numbers
had
absented
themselves
from
school
for
the
purpose
of
beholding
this
procession
do
like
to
see
spirited
at
a
funeral
remarked
one
of
the
mourners
who
had
squeezed
his
way
to
the
parlour
window
puts
the
finishin
touch
as
you
may
say
do
it
when
the
coffin
was
borne
forth
there
was
such
a
press
in
the
street
that
the
men
with
difficulty
reached
the
hearse
as
the
female
mourners
stepped
across
the
pavement
with
handkerchiefs
held
to
their
mouths
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
was
audible
throughout
the
crowd
the
males
were
less
sympathetically
received
and
some
jocose
comments
from
a
costermonger
whose
business
was
temporarily
interrupted
excited
indulgent
smiles
the
procession
moved
slowly
away
and
the
crowd
unwilling
to
disperse
immediately
looked
about
for
some
new
source
of
entertainment
they
were
fortunate
for
at
this
moment
came
round
the
corner
an
individual
notorious
throughout
clerkenwell
as
jack
mad
he
presumably
was
at
all
events
an
idiot
a
lanky
man
perhaps
forty
years
old
not
clad
but
hung
over
with
the
filthiest
rags
hatless
shoeless
he
supported
himself
by
singing
in
the
streets
generally
psalms
and
with
eccentric
modulations
of
the
voice
which
always
occasioned
mirth
in
hearers
sometimes
he
stood
at
a
corner
and
began
the
delivery
of
a
passage
of
scripture
in
french
how
where
or
when
he
could
have
acquired
this
knowledge
was
a
mystery
and
jack
would
throw
no
light
on
his
own
past
at
present
having
watched
the
funeral
coaches
pass
away
he
lifted
up
his
voice
in
a
terrific
blare
singing
ye
works
of
the
lord
bless
ye
the
lord
praise
him
and
magnify
him
for
ever
instantly
he
was
assailed
by
the
juvenile
portion
of
the
throng
was
pelted
with
anything
that
came
to
hand
mocked
mercilessly
buffeted
from
behind
for
a
while
he
persisted
in
his
psalmody
but
at
length
without
warning
he
rushed
upon
his
tormentors
and
with
angry
shrieks
endeavoured
to
take
revenge
the
uproar
continued
till
a
policeman
came
and
cleared
the
way
then
jack
went
off
again
singing
ye
works
of
the
lord
with
his
voice
blended
that
of
the
costermonger
a
bundill
up
in
the
hewetts
lay
jane
snowdon
now
seemingly
asleep
now
delirious
when
she
talked
a
name
was
constantly
upon
her
lips
she
kept
calling
for
kirkwood
amy
was
at
school
annie
and
tom
frequently
went
into
the
room
and
gazed
curiously
at
the
sick
girl
hewett
felt
so
ill
that
she
could
only
lie
on
the
bed
and
try
to
silence
her
baby
crying
the
was
left
wide
open
between
the
departure
and
return
of
the
mourners
a
superstition
of
the
people
demands
this
the
peckovers
brought
back
with
them
some
half
a
dozen
relatives
and
friends
invited
to
a
late
dinner
the
meal
had
been
in
preparation
at
an
close
by
and
was
now
speedily
made
ready
in
the
parlour
a
liberal
supply
of
various
ales
was
furnished
by
the
agency
of
a
absence
being
much
felt
and
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
or
so
the
company
were
sufficiently
restored
to
address
themselves
anew
to
the
bottles
and
decanters
gully
was
now
permitted
to
obey
her
instincts
the
natural
result
could
be
attributed
to
overstrung
feelings
just
when
the
mourners
had
grown
noisily
hilarious
testifying
thereby
to
the
respectability
with
which
things
were
being
conducted
to
the
very
end
peckover
became
aware
of
a
knocking
at
the
she
bade
her
daughter
go
and
see
who
it
was
clem
speedily
returning
beckoned
her
mother
from
among
the
guests
somebody
wants
to
know
if
there
ai
somebody
called
snowdon
livin
she
whispered
in
a
tone
of
alarm
old
man
peckover
never
drank
more
than
was
consistent
with
the
perfect
clearness
of
her
brain
at
present
she
had
very
red
cheeks
and
her
eyes
gleamed
noticeably
but
any
kind
of
business
would
have
found
her
as
shrewdly
competent
as
ever
did
you
say
she
whispered
savagely
i
come
an
ask
stay
do
say
nothink
peckover
left
the
room
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
went
along
the
passage
on
the
doorstep
stood
a
man
with
white
hair
wearing
an
unusual
kind
of
cloak
and
a
strange
hat
he
looked
at
the
landlady
without
speaking
was
you
wantin
mister
have
been
told
replied
the
man
in
a
clear
grave
voice
a
child
of
the
name
of
snowdon
lives
in
your
house
who
told
you
that
people
next
door
but
one
i
been
asking
at
many
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
there
used
to
be
relations
of
mine
lived
somewhere
here
i
do
know
the
house
nor
the
street
exactly
the
name
is
so
very
common
if
you
do
mind
i
should
like
to
ask
you
who
the
parents
was
peckover
eyes
were
searching
the
speaker
with
the
utmost
closeness
do
mind
tellin
you
she
said
there
a
child
of
that
name
in
the
a
young
girl
at
least
though
i
do
rightly
know
her
age
i
take
her
for
fourteen
or
fifteen
the
old
man
seemed
to
consult
his
recollections
it
anyone
i
thinking
of
he
said
slowly
ca
be
quite
as
old
as
that
the
woman
face
changed
she
looked
away
for
a
moment
as
i
was
sayin
i
do
rightly
know
her
age
any
way
responsible
for
her
i
been
a
mother
to
her
an
a
good
mother
though
i
say
it
myself
these
six
years
or
more
i
look
on
her
now
as
a
child
o
my
own
i
do
know
who
you
may
be
mister
you
come
from
abroad
i
have
there
no
reason
why
i
should
tell
you
that
trying
to
find
any
of
my
kin
that
are
still
alive
there
was
a
married
son
of
mine
that
once
lived
somewhere
about
here
his
name
was
joseph
james
snowdon
when
i
last
heard
of
him
he
was
working
at
a
in
clerkenwell
that
was
thirteen
years
ago
i
deal
openly
with
you
i
shall
thank
you
if
you
do
the
like
with
me
will
you
just
come
in
i
got
a
few
friends
in
the
there
been
a
death
in
the
an
there
sickness
an
we
out
of
order
a
bit
i
ask
you
to
come
downstairs
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
though
lights
were
not
yet
required
in
the
upper
rooms
the
kitchen
would
have
been
all
but
dark
save
for
the
fire
peckover
lit
a
lamp
and
bade
her
visitor
be
seated
then
she
his
face
his
attire
his
hands
everything
about
him
told
of
a
life
spent
in
mechanical
labour
his
speech
was
that
of
an
untaught
man
yet
differed
greatly
from
the
tongue
prevailing
in
clerkenwell
he
was
probably
not
a
londoner
by
birth
and
a
point
of
more
moment
he
expressed
himself
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
habitually
thoughtful
who
if
the
aid
of
books
has
been
denied
to
him
still
has
won
from
life
the
kind
of
knowledge
which
develops
character
peckover
had
small
experience
of
faces
which
bear
the
stamp
of
simple
sincerity
this
man
countenance
put
her
out
as
a
matter
of
course
he
wished
to
overreach
her
in
some
way
but
he
was
obviously
very
deep
indeed
and
then
she
found
it
so
difficult
to
guess
his
purposes
how
would
he
proceed
if
she
gave
him
details
of
jane
history
admitting
that
she
was
the
child
of
joseph
james
snowdon
what
again
had
he
been
told
by
the
people
of
whom
he
had
made
inquiries
she
needed
time
to
review
her
position
i
was
sayin
she
resumed
poking
the
fire
been
a
mother
to
her
these
six
years
or
more
an
i
feel
i
done
the
right
thing
by
her
she
was
left
on
my
by
them
as
promised
to
pay
for
her
keep
an
a
few
months
i
may
say
a
few
weeks
was
all
as
ever
i
got
another
woman
would
a
sent
the
child
to
the
but
that
always
the
way
with
me
i
always
actin
against
my
own
interesses
say
that
her
parents
went
away
and
left
her
asked
the
old
man
knitting
his
brows
father
did
her
mother
she
died
in
this
very
an
she
was
buried
from
it
he
gave
her
a
respectable
burial
i
say
that
much
for
him
an
i
should
have
allowed
anything
but
one
as
was
respectable
to
leave
this
i
sooner
a
paid
money
out
o
my
own
pocket
that
always
the
way
with
me
willis
he
my
undertaker
you
find
him
at
number
green
passage
he
buried
my
though
that
was
from
the
close
but
i
never
knew
a
job
turned
out
more
respectable
he
was
we
only
just
buried
my
mother
that
why
i
ai
quite
myself
see
peckover
was
not
wont
to
be
gossippy
she
became
so
at
present
partly
in
consequence
of
the
stimulants
she
had
taken
to
support
her
through
a
trying
ceremony
partly
as
a
means
of
obtaining
time
to
reflect
jane
unlucky
illness
made
an
especial
difficulty
in
her
calculations
she
felt
that
the
longer
she
delayed
mention
of
the
fact
the
more
likely
was
she
to
excite
suspicion
on
the
other
hand
she
could
not
devise
the
suitable
terms
in
which
to
reveal
it
the
steady
gaze
of
the
old
man
was
disconcerting
not
that
he
searched
her
face
with
a
cunning
scrutiny
such
as
her
own
eyes
expressed
she
would
have
found
that
less
troublesome
as
being
familiar
the
anxiety
the
troubled
anticipation
which
her
words
had
aroused
in
him
were
wholly
free
from
shadow
of
ignoble
motive
he
was
pained
and
the
frequent
turning
away
of
his
look
betrayed
that
part
of
the
feeling
was
caused
by
observation
of
the
woman
herself
but
every
movement
visible
on
his
features
was
subdued
by
patience
and
mildness
suffering
was
a
habit
with
him
and
its
fruit
in
this
instance
that
which
spite
of
moral
commonplace
it
least
often
bears
have
told
me
yet
he
said
with
quiet
disregard
of
her
irrelevancies
or
not
her
father
name
was
joseph
snowdon
no
call
to
hide
it
that
was
his
name
i
got
letters
of
his
writin
snowdon
stands
at
the
end
plain
enough
and
he
was
your
son
was
he
was
but
have
you
any
reason
to
think
he
dead
i
never
heard
as
he
was
but
then
i
never
heard
as
he
was
livin
neither
when
his
wife
went
poor
thing
an
it
was
a
chill
on
the
liver
they
said
it
took
her
very
sudden
he
says
to
me
peckover
he
says
i
know
you
for
a
motherly
woman
just
like
that
see
i
know
you
for
a
motherly
woman
he
says
an
the
idea
i
have
in
my
is
as
i
should
like
to
leave
janey
in
your
care
he
says
i
got
work
in
birmingham
an
i
do
see
how
to
take
her
with
me
understand
me
he
says
oh
i
says
not
quite
sure
what
i
ought
to
do
see
oh
i
says
yes
he
says
an
between
you
an
me
he
says
there
wo
be
no
misunderstanding
if
you
keep
janey
with
you
an
she
was
goin
to
school
at
the
time
she
went
to
the
same
as
my
own
clem
clemintiner
understand
if
you
keep
janey
with
you
he
says
for
a
year
or
maybe
two
years
or
maybe
three
years
that
depends
on
cirkinstances
understand
i
ready
he
says
to
pay
you
what
it
right
that
pay
i
should
an
i
sure
he
says
as
we
should
misunderstand
one
another
well
of
course
i
had
my
own
girl
to
bring
up
an
my
own
son
to
look
after
too
a
nice
sort
o
son
just
when
he
was
beginnin
to
do
well
an
ought
to
a
paid
me
back
for
all
the
expense
i
was
at
in
puttin
him
to
a
business
what
must
he
do
but
take
his
to
australia
her
scrutiny
discerned
something
in
the
listener
face
which
led
her
to
ask
you
been
in
australia
yourself
mister
have
the
woman
paused
speculation
at
work
in
her
eyes
you
know
in
what
part
of
the
country
your
son
is
inquired
the
old
man
absently
wrote
me
two
letters
an
the
last
as
come
more
than
a
year
ago
was
from
a
place
called
maryborough
the
other
still
preserved
an
absent
expression
his
eyes
travelled
about
the
room
always
said
pursued
peckover
it
was
snowdon
as
put
australia
into
the
boy
he
used
to
tell
us
he
got
a
brother
there
doin
well
it
was
true
it
was
true
replied
the
old
man
coldly
you
have
told
me
what
came
to
pass
about
the
child
an
exact
report
of
all
that
peckover
had
to
say
on
this
subject
would
occupy
more
space
than
it
merits
the
gist
of
it
was
that
for
less
than
a
year
she
had
received
certain
stipulated
sums
irregularly
that
at
length
no
money
at
all
was
forthcoming
that
in
the
tenderness
of
her
heart
she
had
still
entertained
the
child
sent
her
to
school
privately
instructed
her
in
the
domestic
virtues
trusting
that
such
humanity
would
not
lack
even
its
material
reward
and
that
either
joseph
snowdon
or
someone
akin
to
him
would
ultimately
make
good
to
her
the
expenses
she
had
not
grudged
a
child
as
pays
you
back
for
all
the
trouble
you
take
so
much
i
say
for
her
observed
the
matron
in
conclusion
as
it
has
been
a
little
to
teach
her
tidiness
but
she
only
a
young
thing
still
i
should
wonder
but
she
felt
her
position
a
little
now
an
then
it
only
natural
in
a
growin
girl
do
what
you
can
to
prevent
it
still
she
willin
that
nobody
can
deny
an
i
sure
i
should
never
wish
to
her
cirkinstances
has
been
peculiar
that
understand
i
sure
but
i
done
my
best
to
take
the
place
of
the
mother
as
is
gone
to
a
better
world
an
now
that
she
layin
ill
sure
no
mother
could
feel
it
more
why
did
you
mention
that
before
i
say
as
she
was
ill
why
i
thought
it
was
the
first
word
i
spoke
as
soon
as
you
got
into
the
you
ca
a
noticed
it
or
else
it
was
me
as
is
so
put
about
what
with
havin
a
burial
is
she
asked
the
old
man
anxiously
why
you
do
think
as
i
a
sent
her
to
be
looked
after
by
strangers
she

a

an
kinder
woman
than
hewett
you
would
find
not
if
you
was
to
with
difficulty
the
stranger
obtained
a
few
details
of
the
origin
and
course
of
the
illness
details
wholly
misleading
but
devised
to
reassure
when
he
desired
to
see
jane
peckover
assumed
an
air
of
perfect
willingness
but
reminded
him
that
she
had
nothing
save
his
word
to
prove
that
he
had
indeed
a
legitimate
interest
in
the
girl
can
do
no
more
than
tell
you
that
joseph
james
snowdon
was
my
younger
son
replied
the
old
man
simply
come
back
to
spend
my
last
years
in
england
and
i
hoped
i
hope
still
to
find
my
son
i
wish
to
take
his
child
into
my
own
care
as
he
left
her
to
strangers
perhaps
he
did
do
it
willingly
he
may
be
dead
he
could
have
nothing
to
say
against
me
giving
her
the
care
of
a
parent
been
at
expense
peckover
waited
with
eagerness
but
the
sentence
remained
incomplete
again
the
old
man
eyes
strayed
about
the
room
the
current
of
his
thoughts
seemed
to
change
and
he
said
could
show
me
those
letters
you
spoke
of
of
my
son
writing
course
i
could
was
the
reply
in
the
tone
of
coarse
resentment
whereby
the
scheming
vulgar
are
wont
to
testify
to
their
dishonesty
afterwards
i
should
like
to
see
jane
if
you
be
so
good
the
mild
voice
though
often
diffident
now
and
then
fell
upon
a
note
of
quiet
authority
which
suited
well
with
the
speaker
grave
pure
countenance
as
he
spoke
thus
peckover
rose
and
said
she
would
first
go
upstairs
just
to
see
how
things
were
she
was
absent
ten
minutes
then
a
little
girl
amy
hewett
came
into
the
kitchen
and
asked
the
stranger
to
follow
her
jane
had
been
rapidly
transferred
from
the
mattress
to
the
bedstead
and
the
room
had
been
put
into
such
order
as
was
possible
a
whisper
from
peckover
to
hewett
promising
remission
of
half
a
rent
had
sufficed
to
obtain
for
the
former
complete
freedom
in
her
movements
the
child
excited
by
this
disturbance
had
begun
to
moan
and
talk
inarticulately
peckover
listened
for
a
moment
but
heard
nothing
dangerous
she
bade
the
old
man
enter
noiselessly
and
herself
went
about
on
speaking
only
in
a
hoarse
whisper
the
visitor
had
just
reached
the
bedside
and
was
gazing
with
deep
compassionate
interest
at
the
unconscious
face
when
jane
as
if
startled
half
rose
and
cried
painfully
kirkwood
oh
mr
kirkwood
and
she
stretched
her
hand
out
appearing
to
believe
that
the
friend
she
called
upon
was
near
her
is
that
inquired
the
old
man
turning
to
his
companion
a
friend
of
ours
answered
peckover
herself
puzzled
and
uneasy
again
the
sick
girl
called
kirkwood
but
without
other
words
peckover
urged
the
danger
of
this
excitement
and
speedily
led
the
way
downstairs
chapter

glimpses
of
the
past
sidney
kirkwood
had
a
lodging
in
tysoe
street
clerkenwell
it
is
a
short
street
which
like
so
many
in
london
begins
reputably
and
degenerates
in
its
latter
half
the
cleaner
end
leads
into
wilmington
square
which
consists
of
decently
depressing
houses
occupied
in
the
main
as
the
lower
windows
and
indicate
by
watchmakers
working
jewellers
and
craftsmen
of
allied
pursuits
the
open
space
grateful
in
this
neighbourhood
is
laid
out
as
a
garden
with
trees
beds
and
walks
near
the
iron
gate
which
for
certain
hours
in
the
day
gives
admission
is
a
painted
notice
informing
the
public
that
by
the
grace
of
the
marquis
of
northampton
they
may
here
take
their
ease
on
condition
of
good
behaviour
to
children
is
addressed
a
distinct
warning
that
is
not
a
playing
ground
from
his
window
sidney
had
a
good
view
of
the
square
the
house
in
which
he
lived
was
of
two
storeys
a
brass
plate
on
the
door
showed
the
inscription
dial
painter
the
window
on
the
was
arched
as
in
the
other
dwellings
at
this
end
of
the
street
and
within
stood
an
artistic
arrangement
of
wax
fruit
under
a
glass
shade
supported
by
a
heavy
volume
of
biblical
appearance
the
upper
storey
was
graced
with
a
small
iron
balcony
on
which
straggled
a
few
however
the
exterior
of
this
abode
was
by
comparison
promising
the
curtains
and
blinds
were
clean
the
step
was
washed
and
whitened
the
brass
plate
shone
the
panes
of
glass
had
at
all
events
acquaintance
with
a
duster
a
few
yards
in
the
direction
away
from
the
square
and
tysoe
street
falls
under
the
dominion
of
it
was
not
until
he
set
forth
to
go
to
work
next
morning
that
sidney
called
to
mind
his
conversation
with
jane
that
the
child
should
have
missed
by
five
minutes
a
meeting
with
someone
who
perchance
had
the
will
and
the
power
to
befriend
her
seemed
to
him
in
his
present
mood
merely
an
illustration
of
a
vice
inherent
in
the
nature
of
things
he
determined
to
look
in
at
the
of
which
she
had
spoken
and
hear
for
himself
what
manner
of
man
had
made
inquiries
for
people
named
snowdon
the
name
was
not
a
common
one
it
was
worth
while
to
spend
a
hope
or
two
on
the
chance
of
doing
jane
a
kindness
her
look
and
voice
when
he
bade
her
be
of
good
courage
had
touched
him
in
his
rejected
state
he
felt
that
it
was
pleasant
to
earn
gratitude
even
from
so
humble
a
being
as
the
peckovers
drudge
his
workshop
it
has
been
mentioned
was
in
john
square
of
all
areas
in
london
thus
defined
this
square
of
john
is
probably
the
most
irregular
in
outline
it
is
cut
in
two
by
clerkenwell
road
and
the
buildings
which
compose
it
form
such
a
number
of
recesses
of
abortive
streets
of
shadowed
alleys
that
from
no
point
of
the
square
can
anything
like
a
general
view
of
its
totality
be
obtained
the
exit
from
it
on
the
south
side
is
by
john
lane
at
the
entrance
to
which
stands
a
survival
from
a
buried
world
the
embattled
and
windowed
archway
which
is
all
that
remains
above
ground
of
the
great
priory
of
john
of
jerusalem
here
dwelt
the
knights
hospitallers
in
days
when
clerkenwell
was
a
rural
parish
distant
by
a
long
stretch
of
green
country
from
the
walls
of
london
but
other
and
nearer
memories
are
revived
by
john
arch
in
the
rooms
above
the
gateway
dwelt
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
one
edward
cave
publisher
of
the
and
there
many
a
time
has
sat
a
journeyman
author
of
his
by
name
samuel
johnson
too
often
there
it
was
that
the
said
samuel
once
had
his
dinner
handed
to
him
behind
a
screen
because
of
his
unpresentable
costume
when
cave
was
entertaining
an
aristocratic
guest
in
the
course
of
the
meal
the
guest
happened
to
speak
with
interest
of
something
he
had
recently
read
by
an
obscure
johnson
whereat
there
was
joy
behind
the
screen
and
probably
increased
appreciation
of
the
unwonted
dinner
after
a
walk
amid
the
squalid
and
ways
of
clerkenwell
it
impresses
one
strangely
to
come
upon
this
monument
of
old
time
the
archway
has
a
sad
worn
grimy
aspect
so
closely
is
it
packed
in
among
buildings
which
suggest
nothing
but
the
sordid
struggle
for
existence
that
it
looks
depressed
ashamed
tainted
by
the
ignobleness
of
its
surroundings
the
wonder
is
that
it
has
not
been
swept
away
in
obedience
to
the
great
law
of
traffic
and
the
spirit
of
the
time
john
arch
had
a
place
in
sidney
kirkwood
earliest
memories
from
the
window
of
his
present
workshop
he
could
see
its
grey
battlements
and
they
reminded
him
of
the
days
when
as
a
lad
just
beginning
to
put
questions
about
the
surprising
world
in
which
he
found
himself
he
used
to
listen
to
such
stories
as
his
father
could
tell
him
of
the
history
of
clerkenwell
kirkwood
occupied
part
of
a
house
in
john
lane
not
thirty
yards
from
the
arch
he
was
a
roller
maker
and
did
but
an
indifferent
business
a
year
after
the
birth
of
sidney
his
only
child
he
became
a
widower
an
intelligent
man
the
one
purpose
of
his
latter
years
was
to
realise
such
moderate
competency
as
should
place
his
son
above
the
anxieties
which
degrade
the
boy
had
a
noticeable
turn
for
drawing
and
colouring
at
ten
years
old
when
as
often
happened
his
father
took
him
for
a
sunday
in
the
country
he
carried
a
and
found
his
delight
in
using
it
sidney
was
to
be
a
draughtsman
of
some
kind
perhaps
an
artist
if
all
went
well
unhappily
things
went
the
reverse
of
well
in
his
anxiety
to
improve
his
business
kirkwood
invented
a
new
kind
of
for
printers
use
he
patented
it
risked
capital
upon
it
made
in
a
short
time
some
serious
losses
to
add
to
his
troubles
young
sidney
was
giving
signs
of
an
unstable
character
at
fifteen
he
had
grown
tired
of
his
drawing
wanted
to
be
this
that
and
the
other
thing
was
and
showed
no
consideration
for
his
difficulties
it
was
necessary
to
take
a
decided
step
and
though
against
his
will
sidney
was
apprenticed
to
an
uncle
a
roach
who
also
lived
in
clerkenwell
and
was
a
working
jeweller
two
years
later
the
father
died
all
but
bankrupt
the
few
pounds
realised
from
his
effects
passed
into
the
hands
of
roach
and
were
soon
expended
in
payment
for
sidney
board
and
lodging
his
bereavement
possibly
saved
sidney
from
a
of
foolishness
and
worse
in
the
upper
world
a
youth
may
his
wild
oats
and
have
done
with
it
in
the
nether
have
your
fling
is
almost
necessarily
to
fall
among
criminals
the
death
was
sudden
it
affected
the
lad
profoundly
and
filled
him
with
a
remorse
which
was
to
influence
the
whole
of
his
life
roach
a
and
rather
person
did
not
spare
to
remind
his
apprentice
of
the
most
painful
things
wherewith
the
latter
had
to
reproach
himself
sidney
bore
it
from
this
day
beginning
a
course
of
of
which
not
many
are
capable
at
any
age
and
very
few
indeed
at
seventeen
still
there
had
never
been
any
sympathy
between
him
and
his
uncle
and
before
very
long
the
young
man
saw
his
way
to
live
under
another
roof
and
find
work
with
a
new
employer
it
was
just
after
leaving
his
uncle
house
that
sidney
came
to
know
john
hewett
the
circumstances
which
fostered
their
friendship
were
such
as
threw
strong
light
on
the
characters
of
both
sidney
had
taken
a
room
in
islington
and
two
rooms
on
the
floor
beneath
him
were
tenanted
by
a
man
who
was
a
widower
and
had
two
children
in
those
days
our
young
friend
found
much
satisfaction
in
spending
his
sunday
evenings
on
clerkenwell
green
where
fervent
if
ungrammatical
oratory
was
to
be
heard
and
participation
in
debate
was
open
to
all
whom
the
spirit
moved
one
whom
the
spirit
did
very
frequently
move
was
he
had
no
gift
of
expression
whatever
but
his
brief
stammering
protests
against
this
or
that
social
wrong
had
such
an
honest
indeed
such
a
pathetic
sound
that
sidney
took
an
opportunity
of
walking
home
with
him
and
converting
neighbourship
into
friendly
acquaintance
john
hewett
gave
the
young
man
an
account
of
his
life
he
had
begun
as
a
later
he
had
got
into
started
a
business
on
his
own
account
and
failed
a
brother
of
his
who
was
a
builder
foreman
then
found
employment
for
him
in
general
carpentry
on
some
new
houses
but
john
quarrelled
with
his
brother
and
after
many
difficulties
fell
to
the
making
of
that
was
his
work
at
present
and
with
much
discontent
he
pursued
it
john
was
curiously
frank
in
owning
all
the
faults
in
himself
which
had
helped
to
make
his
career
so
unsatisfactory
he
confessed
that
he
had
an
uncertain
temper
that
he
soon
became
impatient
with
work
led
to
nothing
that
he
was
tempted
out
of
his
prudence
by
anything
which
seemed
to
offer
better
start
with
all
these
admissions
he
maintained
that
he
did
well
to
be
angry
it
was
wrong
that
life
should
be
so
hard
so
much
should
not
be
required
of
a
man
in
body
he
was
not
strong
the
weariness
of
interminable
days
him
and
excited
his
mind
to
vain
discontent
his
wife
was
the
only
one
who
could
ever
keep
him
cheerful
under
his
lot
and
his
wedded
life
had
lasted
but
six
years
now
there
was
his
lad
bob
and
his
little
girl
clara
to
think
of
and
it
only
made
him
more
miserable
to
look
forward
and
see
them
going
through
hardships
like
his
own
things
were
wrong
somehow
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
only
we
could
have
universal
suffrage
sidney
was
only
eighteen
and
strong
in
juvenile
radicalism
but
he
had
a
fund
of
common
sense
and
such
a
conclusion
as
this
of
poor
him
however
the
man
personality
attracted
him
it
was
honest
interesting
the
logic
of
his
pleadings
might
be
at
fault
but
sidney
sympathised
with
him
for
all
that
he
too
felt
that
were
wrong
somehow
and
had
a
pleasure
in
joining
the
side
of
revolt
for
revolt
sake
now
in
the
same
house
with
them
dwelt
a
young
woman
of
about
nineteen
years
old
she
occupied
a
garret
was
seldom
seen
about
and
had
every
appearance
of
being
a
simple
laborious
girl
of
the
kind
familiar
enough
as
the
silent
victims
of
industrialism
one
day
the
house
was
thrown
into
consternation
by
the
news
that
miss
barnes
so
she
was
named
had
been
arrested
on
a
charge
of
stealing
her
employer
goods
it
was
true
and
perhaps
the
best
way
of
explaining
it
will
be
to
reproduce
a
newspaper
report
which
sidney
kirkwood
thereafter
preserved
friday
margaret
barnes
nineteen
a
single
woman
was
indicted
for
stealing
six
jackets
value
the
property
of
mary
oaks
her
mistress
the
prisoner
who
cried
bitterly
during
the
proceedings
pleaded
guilty
the
prosecutrix
is
a
single
woman
and
gets
her
living
by
she
engaged
the
prisoner
to
do
what
is
termed
finishing
off
that
is
making
the
and
sewing
on
the
buttons
the
prisoner
was
also
employed
to
fetch
the
work
from
the
warehouse
and
deliver
it
when
finished
on
september
her
mistress
sent
her
with
the
six
jackets
and
she
never
returned
sergeant
smith
a
detective
who
apprehended
the
prisoner
said
he
had
made
inquiries
in
the
case
and
found
that
up
to
this
time
the
prisoner
had
borne
a
good
character
as
an
honest
girl
she
had
quitted
her
former
lodgings
which
had
no
furniture
but
a
small
table
and
a
few
rags
in
a
corner
and
he
discovered
her
in
a
room
which
was
perfectly
bare
miss
oaks
was
examined
and
said
the
prisoner
was
employed
from
nine
in
the
morning
to
eight
at
night
the
judge
how
much
did
you
pay
her
per
week
miss
oaks
four
shillings
the
judge
did
you
give
her
her
food
miss
oaks
no
i
only
get
one
shilling
each
for
the
jackets
myself
when
completed
i
have
to
use
two
find
my
own
cotton
and
needles
and
i
can
by
working
hard
make
two
in
a
day
the
judge
said
it
was
a
sad
state
of
things
the
prisoner
when
called
upon
said
she
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
three
days
and
so
gave
way
to
temptation
hoping
to
get
better
employment
the
judge
while
commiserating
with
the
prisoner
said
it
could
not
be
allowed
that
distress
should
justify
dishonesty
and
sentenced
the
prisoner
to
six
weeks
imprisonment
the
six
weeks
passed
and
about
a
fortnight
after
that
john
hewett
came
into
sidney
room
one
evening
with
a
strange
look
on
his
face
his
eyes
were
very
bright
the
hand
which
he
held
out
trembled
something
to
tell
you
he
said
going
to
get
married
again
why
i
glad
to
hear
it
who
do
you
think
miss
barnes
sidney
was
startled
for
a
moment
john
had
had
no
acquaintance
with
the
girl
prior
to
her
imprisonment
he
had
said
that
he
should
meet
her
when
she
came
out
and
give
her
some
money
and
sidney
had
added
a
contribution
for
a
man
in
hewett
circumstances
this
latest
step
was
somewhat
astonishing
but
his
character
explained
it
goin
to
marry
her
he
exclaimed
excitedly
i
doing
the
right
thing
i
respect
her
more
than
all
the
women
as
never
went
wrong
because
they
never
had
occasion
to
i
goin
to
put
her
as
a
mother
over
my
children
and
i
goin
to
make
a
happier
life
for
her
she
a
good
girl
i
tell
you
i
seen
her
nearly
every
day
this
fortnight
i
know
all
about
her
she
would
have
me
when
i
first
asked
her
that
was
a
week
ago
she
said
no
she
disgrace
me
if
you
ca
respect
her
as
you
would
any
other
woman
never
come
into
my
lodging
sidney
was
warm
with
generous
glow
he
wrung
hewett
hand
and
stammered
incoherent
words
john
took
new
lodgings
in
an
obscure
part
of
clerkenwell
and
seemed
to
have
become
a
young
man
once
more
his
complaints
ceased
the
energy
with
which
he
went
about
his
work
was
remarkable
he
said
his
wife
was
the
salvation
of
him
and
then
befell
one
of
those
happy
chances
which
supply
mankind
with
instances
for
its
pathetic
faith
that
a
good
deed
will
not
fail
of
reward
john
brother
died
and
bequeathed
to
him
some
four
hundred
pounds
hereupon
what
must
the
poor
fellow
do
but
open
workshops
on
his
own
account
engage
men
go
about
crying
that
his
opportunity
had
come
at
last
here
was
the
bit
of
rock
by
means
of
which
he
could
save
himself
from
the
sea
of
competition
that
had
so
nearly
whelmed
him
little
clara
now
eleven
years
old
could
go
on
steadily
at
school
no
need
to
think
of
how
the
poor
child
should
earn
a
wretched
living
bob
now
thirteen
should
shortly
be
apprenticed
to
some
better
kind
of
trade
new
rooms
were
taken
and
well
furnished
maggie
the
wife
could
have
good
food
such
as
she
needed
in
her
constant
ailing
alas
the
baby
just
born
was
no
longer
a
cause
of
anxious
thought
but
a
joy
in
the
home
and
sidney
kirkwood
came
to
supper
as
soon
as
the
new
rooms
were
in
order
and
his
bright
manly
face
did
everyone
good
to
look
at
he
still
took
little
clara
upon
his
knee
ha
there
would
come
a
day
before
long
when
he
would
not
venture
to
do
that
and
then
perhaps
perhaps
what
a
supper
that
was
and
how
smoothly
went
the
great
wheels
of
the
world
that
evening
one
baby
two
babies
three
babies
before
the
birth
of
the
third
john
brow
was
again
clouded
again
he
had
begun
to
rail
and
fume
at
the
unfitness
of
things
his
business
was
a
failure
partly
because
he
dealt
with
a
too
rigid
honesty
partly
because
of
his
unstable
nature
which
left
him
at
the
mercy
of
whims
and
obstinacies
and
airy
projects
he
did
not
risk
the
ordinary
kind
of
bankruptcy
but
came
down
and
down
until
at
length
he
was
the
only
workman
in
his
own
shop
then
the
shop
itself
had
to
be
abandoned
then
he
was
searching
for
someone
who
would
employ
him
bob
had
been
put
to
the
craft
clara
was
still
going
to
school
and
had
no
thought
of
earning
a
livelihood
ominous
state
of
things
when
it
shortly
became
clear
even
to
john
hewett
that
he
would
wrong
the
girl
if
he
did
not
provide
her
with
some
means
of
supporting
herself
she
was
sent
to
learn
with
the
same
employer
for
whom
her
brother
worked
the
work
was
light
it
would
soon
bring
in
a
little
money
john
declared
with
fierceness
that
his
daughter
should
never
be
set
to
the
usual
and
indeed
it
seemed
very
unlikely
that
clara
would
ever
be
fit
for
that
employment
as
she
could
not
do
the
simplest
kind
of
sewing
in
the
meantime
the
family
kept
changing
their
abode
till
at
length
they
settled
in
house
all
the
best
of
their
furniture
was
by
this
time
sold
but
for
the
two
eldest
children
there
would
probably
have
been
no
home
at
all
bob
aged
nineteen
earned
at
this
present
time
a
pound
weekly
his
sister
an
average
of
thirteen
shillings
hewett
constant
the
result
doubtless
of
through
the
years
of
her
girlhood
would
have
excused
defects
of
housekeeping
but
indeed
the
poor
woman
was
under
any
circumstances
incapable
of
domestic
management
and
therein
represented
her
class
the
money
she
received
was
wasted
in
comparison
with
what
might
have
been
done
with
it
i
suppose
she
must
not
be
blamed
for
bringing
children
into
the
world
when
those
already
born
to
her
were
but
she
increased
the
sum
total
of
the
world
misery
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
the
book
of
genesis
and
one
virtue
she
had
which
compensated
for
all
that
was
lacking
a
virtue
merely
negative
among
the
refined
but
in
that
other
world
the
rarest
and
most
precious
of
moral
distinctions
she
resisted
the
temptations
of
the
this
was
the
story
present
in
sidney
kirkwood
mind
as
often
as
he
climbed
the
staircase
in
clerkenwell
close
by
contrast
his
own
life
seemed
one
of
unbroken
ease
outwardly
it
was
smooth
enough
he
had
no
liking
for
his
craft
and
being
always
employed
upon
the
meaningless
work
which
is
demanded
by
the
rich
vulgar
he
felt
such
work
to
be
paltry
and
ignoble
but
there
seemed
no
hope
of
obtaining
better
and
he
made
no
audible
complaint
his
wages
were
considerably
more
than
he
needed
and
systematically
he
put
money
aside
each
week
but
this
orderly
existence
concealed
conflicts
of
heart
and
mind
which
sidney
himself
could
not
have
explained
could
not
lucidly
have
described
the
moral
shock
which
he
experienced
at
his
father
death
put
an
end
to
the
wanton
play
of
his
energies
but
it
could
not
ripen
him
before
due
time
his
nature
was
not
of
the
sterile
order
common
in
his
world
and
through
passion
through
conflict
through
endurance
it
had
to
develop
such
maturity
as
fate
should
permit
saved
from
he
naturally
turned
into
the
way
of
political
enthusiasm
thither
did
his
temper
point
him
with
some
help
mostly
negative
from
clerkenwell
green
he
reached
the
stage
of
confident
and
aspiring
radicalism
believing
in
the
perfectibility
of
man
in
human
brotherhood
in
anything
you
like
that
is
the
outcome
of
a
noble
heart
sheltered
by
ignorance
it
had
its
turn
and
passed
to
give
place
to
nothing
very
satisfactory
it
was
not
a
mere
coincidence
that
sidney
was
going
through
a
period
of
mental
and
moral
confusion
just
in
those
years
which
brought
clara
hewett
from
childhood
to
the
state
of
woman
among
the
acquaintances
of
sidney
boyhood
there
was
not
one
but
had
a
chosen
female
companion
from
the
age
of
fifteen
or
earlier
he
himself
had
been
no
exception
to
the
rule
in
his
class
but
at
the
time
of
meeting
with
hewett
he
was
companionless
and
remained
so
the
hewetts
became
his
closest
friends
in
their
brief
prosperity
he
rejoiced
with
them
in
their
hardships
he
gave
them
all
the
assistance
to
which
john
pride
would
consent
his
name
was
never
spoken
among
them
but
with
warmth
and
gratitude
and
of
course
the
day
came
to
which
hewett
had
looked
forward
the
day
when
sidney
could
no
longer
take
clara
upon
his
knee
and
stroke
her
brown
hair
and
joke
with
her
about
her
fits
of
good
and
ill
humour
sidney
knew
well
enough
what
was
in
his
friend
mind
and
though
with
no
sense
of
constraint
he
felt
that
this
handsome
capricious
girl
was
destined
to
be
his
wife
he
liked
clara
she
always
attracted
him
and
interested
him
but
her
faults
were
too
obvious
to
escape
any
eye
and
the
older
she
grew
the
more
was
he
impressed
and
troubled
by
them
the
thought
of
clara
became
a
preoccupation
and
with
the
love
which
at
length
he
recognised
there
blended
a
sense
of
fate
fulfilling
itself
his
enthusiasms
his
purposes
never
defined
as
education
would
have
defined
them
were
dissipated
into
utter
vagueness
he
lost
his
guiding
interests
and
found
himself
returning
to
those
of
boyhood
the
country
once
more
attracted
him
he
took
out
his
old
bought
a
new
one
revived
the
regret
that
he
could
not
be
a
painter
of
landscape
a
visit
to
one
or
two
and
then
again
profound
discouragement
recognition
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
mechanic
and
never
could
be
anything
else
it
was
the
end
of
his
illusions
for
him
not
even
passionate
love
was
to
preserve
the
power
of
idealising
its
object
he
loved
clara
with
all
the
desire
of
his
being
but
could
no
longer
deceive
himself
in
judging
her
character
the
same
sad
clearness
of
vision
affected
his
judgment
of
the
world
about
him
of
the
activities
in
which
he
had
once
been
zealous
of
the
conditions
which
enveloped
his
life
and
the
lives
of
those
dear
to
him
the
spirit
of
revolt
often
enough
stirred
within
him
but
no
longer
found
utterance
in
the
speech
which
brings
relief
he
did
his
best
to
dispel
the
mood
mocking
at
it
as
folly
consciously
he
set
himself
the
task
of
becoming
a
practical
man
of
learning
to
make
the
best
of
life
as
he
found
it
of
shunning
as
the
fatal
error
that
habit
of
mind
which
kept
john
hewett
on
the
rack
who
was
he
that
he
should
look
for
pleasant
things
in
his
course
through
the
world
are
the
lower
orders
we
are
the
working
classes
he
said
bitterly
to
his
friend
and
that
seemed
the
final
answer
to
all
his
aspirations
this
was
a
dark
day
with
him
the
gold
he
handled
stung
him
to
hatred
and
envy
and
every
feeling
which
he
had
resolved
to
combat
as
worse
than
profitless
he
could
not
speak
to
his
from
morning
to
night
it
had
rained
john
arch
looked
more
than
ever
drenched
in
sooty
moisture
during
the
he
walked
over
to
the
of
which
jane
had
spoken
and
obtained
from
the
barman
as
full
a
description
as
possible
of
the
person
he
hoped
to
encounter
both
then
and
on
his
return
home
in
the
evening
he
shunned
the
house
where
his
friends
dwelt
it
came
round
to
monday
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
he
had
allowed
sunday
to
pass
without
visiting
the
hewetts
he
felt
that
to
go
there
at
present
would
only
be
to
increase
the
parents
depression
by
his
own
low
spirits
clara
had
left
them
now
however
and
if
he
still
stayed
away
his
behaviour
might
be
misinterpreted
on
returning
from
work
he
washed
took
a
hurried
meal
and
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
when
someone
knocked
at
his
door
he
opened
and
saw
an
old
man
who
was
a
stranger
to
him
chapter
vii
byass
lodgings
are
mr
kirkwood
said
his
visitor
civilly
name
is
snowdon
i
should
be
glad
to
speak
a
few
words
with
you
if
you
could
spare
the
time
sidney
thoughts
were
instantly
led
into
the
right
channel
he
identified
the
old
man
by
his
white
hair
and
the
cloak
the
hat
however
which
had
been
described
to
him
was
now
exchanged
for
a
soft
felt
of
a
kind
common
enough
the
guernsey
too
had
been
laid
aside
with
ready
goodwill
he
invited
snowdon
to
enter
there
was
not
much
in
the
room
to
distinguish
it
from
the
dwelling
of
any
orderly
mechanic
a
small
bed
occupied
one
side
a
small
table
stood
before
the
window
the
toilet
apparatus
was
of
course
unconcealed
a
cupboard
allowed
a
glimpse
of
crockery
sundries
and
a
few
books
the
walls
it
is
true
were
otherwise
ornamented
than
is
usual
engravings
and
some
sketches
of
landscape
in
pencil
were
suspended
wherever
light
fell
and
the
choice
manifested
in
this
collection
was
nowise
akin
to
that
which
ruled
in
peckover
parlour
and
probably
in
all
the
parlours
of
tysoe
street
to
select
for
one
chamber
a
woodcut
after
constable
or
gainsborough
is
at
all
events
to
give
proof
of
a
capacity
for
civilisation
the
visitor
made
a
quick
survey
of
these
appearances
then
he
seated
himself
on
the
chair
sidney
offered
he
was
not
entirely
at
his
ease
and
looked
up
at
the
young
man
twice
or
thrice
before
he
began
to
speak
again
kirkwood
were
you
ever
acquainted
with
my
son
by
name
joseph
snowdon
i
never
knew
him
was
the
reply
have
heard
his
name
and
i
know
where
he
once
lived
not
far
from
here
wondering
what
has
brought
me
to
you
i
have
heard
of
you
from
people
a
grandchild
of
mine
is
living
with
i
dare
say
it
is
the
house
you
mean
in
clerkenwell
close
you
have
found
it
exclaimed
sidney
with
pleasure
been
looking
about
for
you
as
i
walked
along
the
streets
these
last
two
or
three
days
for
me
said
the
other
astonished
sidney
supplied
the
explanation
but
without
remarking
on
the
circumstances
which
made
jane
so
anxious
to
discover
a
possible
friend
snowdon
listened
attentively
and
at
length
with
a
slight
smile
he
seemed
to
find
pleasure
in
the
young
man
way
of
expressing
himself
when
silence
ensued
he
looked
about
absently
for
a
moment
then
meeting
sidney
eyes
said
in
a
grave
voice
poor
child
is
very
i
sorry
to
hear
it
reason
i
come
to
you
kirkwood
is
because
she
called
out
your
name
so
often
they
do
seem
able
to
tell
me
how
she
came
into
this
state
but
she
had
a
fright
of
some
kind
or
she
been
living
very
unhappily
she
calls
on
your
name
as
if
she
wanted
you
to
protect
her
from
harm
i
did
know
what
to
think
about
it
at
first
i
a
stranger
to
everybody
i
may
tell
you
i
been
abroad
for
several
years
and
they
do
seem
very
ready
to
put
trust
in
me
but
i
decided
at
last
that
i
come
and
speak
to
you
it
my
grandchild
and
perhaps
the
only
one
of
my
family
left
nobody
can
give
me
news
of
her
father
since
he
went
away
four
or
five
years
ago
she
came
to
herself
this
morning
for
a
little
but
i
afraid
she
could
understand
what
i
tried
to
tell
her
then
i
mentioned
your
name
and
i
could
see
it
did
her
good
at
once
what
i
wish
to
ask
of
you
is
would
you
come
to
her
bedside
for
a
few
minutes
she
might
know
you
and
i
feel
sure
it
would
be
a
kindness
to
her
sidney
appeared
to
hesitate
it
was
not
of
course
that
he
dreamt
of
refusing
but
he
was
busy
revolving
all
he
knew
of
jane
life
with
the
peckovers
and
asking
himself
what
it
behoved
him
to
tell
what
to
withhold
daily
experience
guarded
him
against
the
habit
of
gossip
which
is
one
of
the
innumerable
curses
of
the
uneducated
whether
poor
or
wealthy
and
notwithstanding
the
sympathy
with
which
his
visitor
inspired
him
he
quickly
decided
to
maintain
reserve
until
he
understood
more
of
the
situation
yes
i
go
with
you
at
once
he
made
haste
to
reply
when
he
perceived
that
his
hesitancy
was
occasioning
doubt
and
trouble
fact
i
was
just
starting
to
go
and
see
the
hewetts
when
you
knocked
at
the
door
they
friends
of
mine
living
in
peckover
house
that
how
i
came
to
know
jane
i
have
been
there
for
several
days
and
when
i
last
saw
her
as
i
was
saying
she
seemed
as
well
as
usual
afraid
that
was
much
to
boast
of
said
snowdon
a
poor
child
sidney
was
conscious
that
the
old
man
did
not
give
expression
to
all
he
thought
this
mutual
exercise
of
tact
seemed
however
to
encourage
a
good
understanding
between
them
rather
than
the
reverse
remain
in
the
house
kirkwood
asked
as
they
went
downstairs
stay
with
her
through
the
night
i
did
feel
much
confidence
in
the
doctor
that
was
seeing
her
so
i
made
inquiries
and
found
a
better
man
when
they
reached
the
close
the
door
was
opened
to
them
by
clem
peckover
she
glared
haughtily
at
sidney
but
uttered
no
word
to
kirkwood
surprise
they
went
up
to
the
hewetts
the
mattress
that
formerly
lay
upon
the
floor
had
been
removed
the
bed
was
occupied
by
the
sick
girl
with
whom
at
present
peckover
was
sitting
that
benevolent
person
rose
on
seeing
sidney
and
inclined
her
head
with
stateliness
just
fell
asleep
was
her
whispered
remark
should
say
myself
as
it
was
good
to
wake
her
up
but
of
course
you
know
best
this
was
in
keeping
with
the
attitude
peckover
had
adopted
as
soon
as
she
understood
snowdon
resolve
to
neglect
no
precaution
on
the
child
behalf
her
sour
dignity
was
meant
to
express
that
she
felt
hurt
at
the
intervention
of
others
where
her
affections
were
so
nearly
concerned
sidney
could
not
help
a
certain
fear
when
he
saw
this
woman
installed
as
it
was
of
purpose
that
he
caught
her
eye
and
regarded
her
with
a
gravity
she
could
scarcely
fail
to
comprehend
jane
awoke
from
her
fitful
slumber
she
looked
with
but
fearfulness
at
the
figures
darkening
her
view
sidney
moved
so
that
his
face
was
in
the
light
and
bending
near
to
her
asked
if
she
recognised
him
a
smile
but
unmistakable
at
last
amply
justified
what
her
grandfather
had
said
she
made
an
effort
to
move
her
hand
towards
him
sidney
responded
to
her
wish
and
again
she
smiled
contentedly
snowdon
turned
to
peckover
and
after
a
few
words
with
regard
to
the
treatment
that
was
being
pursued
said
that
he
would
now
relieve
her
she
lingered
but
shortly
left
the
room
sidney
sitting
by
the
bed
in
a
few
minutes
saw
that
jane
once
more
slept
or
appeared
to
do
so
he
whispered
to
snowdon
that
he
was
going
to
see
his
friends
in
the
next
room
and
would
look
in
again
before
leaving
his
tap
at
the
door
was
answered
by
amy
who
at
once
looked
back
and
said
kirkwood
come
in
mother
i
want
to
see
him
was
the
answer
hewett
was
lying
in
bed
she
looked
if
possible
more
wretchedly
ill
than
four
days
ago
on
the
floor
were
two
mattresses
covered
to
make
beds
for
the
children
the
baby
held
in
its
mother
arms
was
crying
feebly
i
hoped
you
were
getting
much
better
by
now
said
sidney
hewett
told
him
that
she
had
been
to
the
hospital
on
saturday
and
seemed
to
have
caught
cold
a
common
enough
occurrence
hours
of
waiting
in
an
room
frequently
do
more
harm
than
the
doctor
advice
can
remedy
she
explained
that
peckover
had
requested
the
use
of
the
other
room
too
many
of
us
to
be
livin
an
sleepin
in
this
little
place
she
said
after
all
it
a
savin
of
rent
it
a
good
thing
clara
is
here
an
you
heard
as
john
got
work
he
had
found
a
job
at
length
with
a
tonight
he
would
probably
be
working
till
ten
or
eleven
good
news
so
far
then
hewett
began
to
speak
with
curiosity
of
the
old
man
who
claimed
jane
as
his
grandchild
sidney
told
her
what
had
just
happened
what
did
you
say
about
the
girl
she
asked
anxiously
said
as
little
as
i
could
i
thought
it
wisest
do
you
know
what
made
her
ill
was
that
clem
as
did
it
hewett
replied
subduing
her
voice
and
she
related
what
had
befallen
after
sidney
last
visit
peckover
she
that
afraid
the
truth
should
get
out
of
course
i
want
to
make
no
bother
but
i
do
feel
that
glad
the
poor
thing
got
somebody
to
look
after
her
at
last
i
never
told
you
half
the
things
as
used
to
go
on
that
clem
no
better
than
a
tiger
but
then
what
can
you
do
there
never
any
good
comes
out
of
makin
a
bother
with
other
people
business
is
there
fancy
him
comin
to
see
you
peckover
afraid
of
him
i
can
see
that
though
she
pretends
she
is
goin
to
stand
him
interferin
what
do
you
think
about
him
sidney
he
sent
for
a
doctor
out
of
islington
would
have
to
say
to
the
other
he
must
have
plenty
of
money
do
you
think
peckover
says
he
goin
to
pay
the
money
owin
to
her
for
keep
as
if
the
poor
thing
had
more
than
paid
for
her
bits
of
meals
an
her
bed
in
the
kitchen
do
you
think
that
woman
ever
have
kept
her
if
it
was
she
could
make
her
a
servant
with
no
wages
if
jane
been
a
boy
she
a
gone
to
the
workhouse
long
ago
she
been
that
handy
poor
little
mite
i
always
done
what
i
could
for
her
you
know
that
sidney
i
do
hope
she

over
it
if
anything
happens

my
word
there

a
nice
clara
says

to
a
magistrate

if
nobody

she
hates
the
peckovers
clara
does
wo
come
to
that
said
sidney
can
see
the
old
man
take
her
away
as
soon
as
possible
he
may
have
a
little
money
he
just
come
back
from
australia
i
like
the
look
of
him
myself
he
began
to
talk
of
other
subjects
waxed
wrath
at
the
misery
of
this
housing
to
which
the
family
had
shrunk
urged
a
removal
from
the
vile
den
as
soon
as
ever
it
could
be
managed
sidney
always
lost
control
of
himself
when
he
talked
with
the
hewetts
of
their
difficulties
the
people
were
from
his
point
of
view
so
lacking
in
resource
so
stubbornly
rooted
in
profitless
habit
over
and
over
again
he
had
implored
them
to
take
a
rational
view
of
the
case
to
borrow
a
few
pounds
of
him
to
make
a
new
beginning
on
clean
soil
it
was
like
contending
with
some
hostile
force
of
nature
he
spent
himself
in
vain
as
hewett
did
not
return
he
at
length
took
his
leave
and
went
into
the
for
a
moment
asleep
said
snowdon
rising
from
the
chair
where
he
had
been
sitting
deep
in
thought
a
good
sign
sidney
just
looked
towards
the
bed
and
nodded
with
satisfaction
the
old
man
gave
him
a
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
and
he
departed
all
the
way
home
he
thought
with
singular
interest
of
the
bare
of
the
man
watching
through
the
night
the
picture
impressed
him
in
a
way
that
could
not
be
explained
by
its
natural
pathos
merely
it
kept
suggesting
all
sorts
of
fanciful
ideas
due
in
a
measure
possibly
to
hewett
speculations
for
an
hour
he
was
so
lost
in
musing
on
the
subject
that
he
even
rested
from
the
misery
of
his
ceaseless
thought
of
clara
he
allowed
three
days
to
pass
then
went
to
inquire
about
progress
it
had
been
satisfactory
subsequent
visits
brought
him
to
terms
of
a
certain
intimacy
with
snowdon
the
latter
mentioned
at
length
that
he
was
looking
for
two
rooms
suitable
for
himself
and
jane
he
wished
them
to
be
in
a
decent
house
somewhere
in
clerkenwell
and
the
rent
was
not
to
be
more
than
a
working
man
could
afford
do
know
of
anything
in
your
street
he
asked
diffidently
something
in
the
tone
struck
sidney
it
half
expressed
a
wish
to
live
in
his
neighbourhood
if
possible
he
looked
at
his
companion
they
were
walking
together
and
was
met
in
return
with
a
glance
of
calm
friendliness
it
gratified
him
strengthened
the
feeling
of
respect
and
attachment
which
had
already
grown
out
of
this
intercourse
in
tysoe
street
however
no
accommodation
could
be
found
sidney
had
another
project
in
his
thoughts
pursuing
it
he
paid
a
visit
the
next
evening
to
certain
acquaintances
of
his
named
byass
who
had
a
house
in
hanover
street
islington
and
let
lodgings
hanover
street
lies
to
the
north
of
city
road
it
is
a
quiet
byway
of
curving
form
and
consists
of
dwellings
only
squalor
is
here
kept
at
arm
length
compared
with
regions
close
at
hand
this
and
the
contiguous
streets
have
something
of
a
suburban
aspect
three
or
four
steps
led
up
to
the
sidney
knock
summoned
a
young
comely
woman
who
evinced
hearty
pleasure
on
seeing
who
her
visitor
was
she
brought
him
at
once
into
a
parlour
on
the
an
i
was
only
this
mornin
tellin
sam
to
go
an
look
after
you
or
write
a
note
or
somethin
why
ca
you
come
round
oftener
i
no
patience
with
you
you
just
sit
at
an
get
humped
what
the
good
o
that
i
should
like
to
know
i
thought

took
offence
with
me
an
so
i
told
sam
do
you
want
to
know
how
baby
is
why
do
you
ask
then
as
you
ought
to
do
the
first
thing
he
a
good
deal
better
than
he
deserves
to
be
young
rascal
all
the
trouble
he
gives
me
he
fast
asleep
i
glad
to
say
so
you
ca
see
him
sam
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
at
least
i
expect
him
but
there
no
knowin
nowadays
when
he
can
leave
the
warehouse
what
brought
you
i
wonder
you
need
tell
me
anything
about
the
upper
street
business
know
all
about
do
you
from
clara
herself
do
talk
to
me
about
her
there
i
sick
an
tired
of
her
so
are
you
i
should
think
if
you
any
sense
left
her
an
me
get
along
an
that
the
truth
why
when
i
met
her
on
sunday
afternoon
she
was
that
patronisin
you
have
thought
she
got
a
place
in
windsor
castle
would
she
come
an
have
a
cup
of
tea
oh
dear
no
had
time
the
princess
of
wales
i
suppose
was
waitin
round
the
corner
having
so
relieved
her
mind
byass
laughed
with
a
genuine
gaiety
which
proved
how
little
malice
there
was
in
her
satire
sidney
could
not
refuse
a
smile
but
it
was
a
gloomy
one
not
sure
you
done
all
you
might
have
to
keep
her
friends
with
you
he
said
seriously
but
with
a
look
you
go
exclaimed
byass
throwing
back
her
head
course
everybody
must
be
in
fault
sooner
than
she
an
angel
is
miss
hewett
poor
dear
to
think
how
shameful
she
been
used
now
i
do
wonder
how
you
the
face
to
say
such
things
kirkwood
why
there
nobody
else
livin
would
have
been
as
patient
with
her
as
i
always
was
i
not
i
will
say
that
for
myself
an
put
up
with
all
sorts
of
things
me
a
married
woman
when
anyone
else
would
have
boxed
her
ears
and
told
her
she
was
a
conceited
minx
i
used
to
be
fond
of
clara
you
know
i
did
but
she
got
beyond
all
bearin
and
if
you
was
just
as
foolish
as
men
always
are
you
see
her
in
her
true
colours
do
shake
yourself
a
bit
do
oh
you
silly
silly
man
again
she
burst
into
ringing
laughter
throwing
herself
backwards
and
forwards
and
at
last
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
sidney
looked
annoyed
but
the
contagion
of
such
spontaneous
merriment
in
the
end
brought
another
smile
to
his
face
he
moved
his
head
in
sign
of
giving
up
the
argument
and
as
soon
as
there
was
silence
turned
to
the
object
of
his
visit
see
you
still
got
the
card
in
the
window
i
should
wonder
if
i
could
find
you
a
lodger
for
those
who
that
no
children
mind
sidney
told
her
what
he
could
of
the
old
man
of
jane
he
only
said
that
she
had
hitherto
lived
with
the
hewetts
landlady
and
was
now
going
to
be
removed
by
her
grandfather
having
just
got
through
an
illness
dire
visions
of
infection
at
once
assailed
byass
impossible
to
admit
under
the
same
roof
with
her
baby
a
person
who
had
just
been
ill
this
scruple
was
however
overcome
the
two
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
house
unfurnished
had
been
long
vacant
owing
to
fastidiousness
in
and
byass
since
their
last
lodger
after
a
fortnight
of
continuous
drunkenness
broke
the
windows
ripped
the
paper
off
the
walls
and
ended
by
trying
to
set
fire
to
the
house
sidney
was
intrusted
with
an
outline
treaty
to
be
communicated
to
snowdon
this
discussion
was
just
concluded
when
samuel
byass
presented
himself
a
slender
young
man
with
very
light
hair
cropped
close
upon
the
scalp
and
a
foolish
face
screwed
into
an
expression
of
facetiousness
he
was
employed
in
some
clerkly
capacity
at
a
wholesale
stationer
in
city
road
having
stepped
into
the
room
he
removed
a
very
brown
silk
hat
and
laid
it
on
a
chair
winking
the
while
at
sidney
with
his
right
eye
then
he
removed
his
overcoat
winking
with
the
left
eye
thus
disembarrassed
he
strode
gravely
to
the
fireplace
took
up
the
poker
held
it
in
the
manner
of
a
weapon
upright
against
his
shoulder
and
exclaimed
in
a
severe
voice
right
then
converting
the
poker
into
a
sword
he
drew
near
to
sidney
and
affected
to
practise
upon
him
the
military
cuts
his
features
distorted
into
grotesque
ferocity
finally
assuming
the
attitude
of
a
juggler
he
made
an
attempt
to
balance
the
poker
perpendicularly
upon
his
nose
until
it
fell
with
a
crash
just
missing
the
ornaments
on
the
all
this
time
byass
shrieked
with
laughter
with
difficulty
keeping
her
chair
sam
she
panted
forth
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
a
fool
you
are
do
stop
or
you
kill
me
vastly
gratified
samuel
advanced
with
ludicrous
gestures
towards
the
visitor
held
out
his
hand
and
said
with
affected
nasality
do
you
do
sir
it
some
time
since
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
sir
i
hope
you
have
been
pretty
tolerable
he
a
fool
mr
kirkwood
cried
the
delighted
wife
just
give
him
a
smack
on
the
side
of
the
head
to
please
me
sam
go
wash
an
we
have
supper
what
do
you
mean
by
being
so
late
the
infant
asked
byass
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
waistcoat
pockets
and
peering
about
the
room
forth
the
infant
let
a
fond
parent
look
upon
his
child
an
wash
or
i
throw
something
at
you
baby
in
bed
and
mind
you
wake
him
if
you
dare
sidney
would
have
taken
his
leave
but
found
it
impossible
byass
declared
that
if
he
would
not
stay
to
supper
he
should
never
enter
the
house
again
make
a
night
of
it
cried
sam
standing
in
the
doorway
have
three
pots
of
six
ale
and
a
bottle
of
old
tom
let
us
be
reckless
his
wife
caught
up
the
pillow
from
the
sofa
and
hurled
it
at
him
samuel
escaped
just
in
time
the
next
moment
his
head
was
again
thrust
forward
send
to
the
high
street
for
three
cold
roast
fowls
and
a
pie
let
get
custards
and
and
french
pastry
let
have
a
and
preserved
ginger
who
says
go
it
for
once
byass
caught
up
the
poker
and
sprang
after
him
from
the
passage
came
sounds
of
scuffling
and
screaming
and
in
the
end
of
something
produced
by
the
lips
byass
then
showed
a
very
red
face
at
the
door
and
said
he
a
fool
just
wait
a
minute
while
i
get
the
table
laid
supper
was
soon
ready
in
the
comfortable
kitchen
a
cold
shoulder
of
mutton
a
piece
of
cheese
pickled
beetroot
a
and
raspberry
jam
such
was
the
fare
to
which
bessie
byass
invited
her
husband
and
her
guest
on
a
were
some
open
cardboard
boxes
containing
artificial
flowers
and
leaves
for
bessie
had
now
and
then
a
little
to
do
for
a
shop
in
upper
street
and
in
that
way
aided
the
income
of
the
family
she
was
in
even
better
spirits
than
usual
at
the
prospect
of
letting
her
on
hearing
that
piece
of
news
samuel
who
had
just
come
from
the
nearest
with
a
foaming
jug
executed
a
wild
dance
round
the
room
and
inadvertently
knocked
two
plates
from
the
dresser
this
accident
made
his
wife
wrathful
but
only
for
a
moment
presently
she
was
laughing
as
unrestrainedly
as
ever
and
bestowing
upon
the
repentant
young
man
her
familiar
flattery
at
eleven
sidney
left
them
and
mused
with
smiles
on
his
way
home
this
was
not
exactly
his
ideal
of
domestic
happiness
yet
it
was
better
than
the
life
led
by
the
hewetts
better
than
that
of
other
households
with
which
he
was
acquainted
better
far
it
seemed
to
him
than
the
aspirations
which
were
threatening
to
lead
poor
clara
who
knew
whither
a
temptation
beset
him
to
walk
round
into
upper
street
and
pass
tubbs
bar
he
resisted
it
knowing
that
the
result
would
only
be
a
night
of
sleepless
anger
and
misery
the
next
day
he
again
saw
snowdon
and
spoke
to
him
of
rooms
the
old
man
seemed
at
first
indisposed
to
go
so
far
but
when
he
had
seen
the
interior
of
the
house
and
talked
with
the
landlady
his
objections
disappeared
before
another
week
had
passed
the
two
rooms
were
furnished
in
the
simplest
possible
way
and
snowdon
brought
jane
from
clerkenwell
close
kirkwood
came
by
invitation
as
soon
as
the
two
were
fairly
established
in
their
home
he
found
jane
sitting
by
the
fire
in
her
room
a
very
little
exertion
still
her
and
the
strange
things
that
had
come
to
pass
had
made
her
habitually
silent
she
looked
about
her
wonderingly
seemed
unable
to
realise
her
position
was
painfully
conscious
of
her
new
clothes
ever
and
again
started
as
if
in
fear
what
did
i
say
that
night
was
sidney
greeting
i
tell
you
it
would
be
all
right
soon
jane
made
no
answer
in
words
but
locked
at
him
timidly
and
then
a
smile
came
upon
her
face
an
expression
of
joy
that
could
not
trust
itself
that
seemed
to
her
too
boldly
at
variance
with
all
she
had
yet
known
of
life
chapter

pennyloaf
candy
in
the
social
classification
of
the
nether
world
a
subject
which
so
eminently
adapts
itself
to
the
sportive
and
gracefully
picturesque
mode
of
treatment
it
will
be
convenient
to
distinguish
broadly
and
with
reference
to
males
alone
the
two
great
sections
of
those
who
do
and
those
who
do
not
wear
collars
each
of
these
orders
would
it
is
obvious
offer
much
scope
to
an
analyst
delighting
in
subtle
gradation
taking
the
collarless
how
shrewdly
might
one
discriminate
between
the
many
kinds
of
neckcloth
which
our
climate
renders
necessary
as
a
substitute
for
the
nobler
article
of
attire
the
navvy
the
scaffolder
the
costermonger
the
innumerable
would
be
the
varieties
of
texture
of
fold
of
knot
observed
in
the
ranks
of
unskilled
labour
and
among
these
whose
higher
station
is
indicated
by
the
linen
or
paper
symbol
what
a
gap
between
the
mechanic
with
collar
attached
to
a
flannel
shirt
and
just
visible
along
the
top
of
a
black
tie
and
the
shopman
whose
pride
it
is
to
adorn
himself
with
the
very
ugliest
put
in
vogue
by
aristocratic
sanction
for
such
attractive
disquisition
i
have
unfortunately
no
space
it
must
suffice
that
i
indicate
the
two
genera
and
i
was
led
to
do
so
in
thinking
of
bob
hewett
bob
wore
a
collar
in
the
establishment
which
employed
him
there
were
it
is
true
two
men
who
belonged
to
the
collarless
but
their
business
was
down
in
the
basement
of
the
building
where
they
kept
up
a
furnace
worked
huge
and
so
on
workshop
was
upstairs
and
the
companions
with
whom
he
sat
without
exception
had
something
white
and
stiff
round
their
necks
in
fact
they
were
every
bit
as
respectable
as
sidney
kirkwood
and
such
as
he
who
bent
over
a
jeweller
table
to
john
hewett
it
was
no
slight
gratification
that
he
had
been
able
to
apprentice
his
son
to
a
craft
which
permitted
him
always
to
wear
a
collar
i
would
not
imply
that
john
thought
of
the
matter
in
these
terms
but
his
reflections
bore
this
significance
bob
was
raised
for
ever
above
the
rank
of
those
who
depend
merely
upon
their
muscles
even
as
clara
was
saved
from
the
dismal
destiny
of
the
women
who
can
do
nothing
but
sew
there
was
on
the
whole
some
reason
why
john
hewett
should
feel
pride
in
his
eldest
son
like
sidney
kirkwood
bob
had
early
shown
a
faculty
for
draughtsmansbip
when
at
school
he
made
decidedly
clever
caricatures
of
such
persons
as
displeased
him
and
he
drew
such
wonderful
horses
on
the
or
pulling
cabs
such
laughable
donkeys
in
costers
carts
such
perfect
dogs
that
on
several
occasions
some
friend
had
purchased
with
a
veritable
shilling
a
specimen
of
his
work
him
to
the
said
an
acquaintance
of
the
family
himself
so
employed
find
a
use
for
this
kind
of
thing
some
day
is
not
the
craft
it
once
was
cheap
methods
vulgarising
here
as
everywhere
have
diminished
the
opportunities
of
capable
men
but
a
fair
living
was
promised
the
lad
if
he
stuck
to
his
work
and
at
the
age
of
nineteen
he
was
already
earning
his
pound
a
week
then
he
was
clever
in
a
good
many
other
ways
he
had
an
ear
for
music
played
nothing
else
was
within
his
reach
the
concertina
sang
a
lively
song
with
uncommon
melodiousness
a
gift
much
appreciated
at
the
meetings
of
a
certain
mutual
benefit
club
to
which
his
father
had
paid
a
weekly
subscription
without
fail
through
all
adversities
in
the
regular
departments
of
learning
bob
had
never
shown
any
particular
aptitude
he
wrote
and
read
decently
but
his
speech
as
you
have
had
occasion
for
observing
was
not
marked
by
refinement
and
for
books
he
had
no
liking
his
father
unfortunately
had
spoilt
him
just
as
he
had
spoilt
clara
being
of
the
nobly
independent
sex
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
he
practically
freed
himself
from
parental
control
the
use
he
made
of
his
liberty
was
not
altogether
pleasing
to
john
but
the
time
for
restraint
and
training
had
hopelessly
gone
by
the
lad
was
selfish
that
there
was
no
denying
he
grudged
the
money
demanded
of
him
for
his
support
but
in
other
matters
he
always
showed
himself
so
so
disposed
to
a
genial
understanding
that
the
great
fault
had
to
be
blinked
many
failings
might
have
been
forgiven
him
in
consideration
of
the
fact
that
he
had
never
yet
drunk
too
much
and
indeed
cared
little
for
liquor
men
of
talent
as
you
are
aware
not
seldom
exhibit
low
tastes
in
their
choice
of
companionship
bob
was
a
case
in
point
he
did
not
sufficiently
appreciate
social
distinctions
he
who
wore
a
collar
seemed
to
prefer
associating
with
the
collarless
there
was
jack
more
properly
bartley
for
instance
his
bosom
friend
until
they
began
to
cool
in
consequence
of
a
common
interest
in
miss
peckover
jack
never
wore
a
collar
in
his
life
not
even
on
sundays
and
was
closely
allied
with
all
sorts
of
blackguards
who
somehow
made
a
living
on
the
outskirts
of
and
there
was
eli
snape
compared
with
whom
jack
was
a
person
of
refinement
and
culture
eli
dealt
surreptitiously
in
dogs
and
rats
and
the
mere
odour
of
him
was
intolerable
to
ordinary
nostrils
yet
he
was
a
species
of
hero
in
regard
such
invaluable
information
could
he
supply
with
regard
to
in
which
young
hewett
took
a
profound
interest
perhaps
a
more
serious
aspect
of
bob
disregard
for
social
standing
was
revealed
in
his
relations
with
the
other
sex
susceptible
from
his
tender
youth
he
showed
no
ambition
in
the
bestowal
of
his
amorous
homage
at
the
age
of
sixteen
did
he
not
declare
his
resolve
to
wed
the
daughter
of
old
sally
budge
who
went
about
selling
watercress
and
was
there
not
a
desperate
conflict
at
home
before
this
project
could
be
driven
from
his
head
it
was
but
the
first
of
many
such
instances
had
he
been
left
to
his
own
devices
he
would
already
like
numbers
of
his
coevals
have
been
supporting
or
declining
to
support
a
wife
and
two
or
three
children
at
present
he
was
to
clem
peckover
that
was
an
understood
thing
his
father
did
not
approve
it
but
this
connection
was
undeniably
better
than
those
he
had
previously
declared
or
concealed
bob
it
seemed
evident
was
fated
to
make
a
a
pity
seeing
his
parts
and
prospects
he
might
have
aspired
to
a
wife
who
had
scarcely
any
difficulty
with
her
whose
enabled
her
to
look
with
compassion
on
girls
who
could
not
play
the
piano
who
counted
among
her
relatives
not
one
collarless
individual
clem
as
we
have
seen
had
already
found
or
imagined
cause
for
dissatisfaction
with
her
betrothed
she
was
well
enough
acquainted
with
bob
repute
and
her
temper
made
it
improbable
to
say
the
least
that
the
course
of
wooing
would
in
this
case
run
very
smoothly
at
present
various
little
signs
were
beginning
to
convince
her
that
she
had
a
rival
and
the
hints
of
her
rejected
admirer
jack
bartley
fixed
her
suspicions
upon
an
acquaintance
whom
she
had
hitherto
regarded
merely
with
contempt
this
was
pennyloaf
candy
formerly
with
her
parents
a
lodger
in
peckover
house
the
family
had
been
ousted
some
eighteen
months
ago
on
account
of
failure
to
pay
their
rent
and
of
the
frequent
intoxication
of
candy
pennyloaf
legal
name
was
penelope
which
being
pronounced
as
a
trisyllable
transformed
itself
by
further
corruption
into
a
sound
at
all
events
conveying
some
meaning
applied
in
the
first
instance
jocosely
the
title
grew
inseparable
from
her
and
was
the
one
she
herself
always
used
her
employment
was
the
making
of
shirts
for
export
she
earned
on
an
average
tenpence
a
day
and
frequently
worked
fifteen
hours
between
leaving
and
returning
to
her
home
that
bob
hewett
could
interest
himself
with
whatever
motive
in
a
person
of
this
description
miss
peckover
at
first
declined
to
believe
a
hint
however
was
quite
enough
to
excite
her
jealous
temperament
as
proof
accumulated
cunning
and
ferocity
wrought
in
her
for
the
devising
of
such
a
declaration
of
war
as
should
speedily
scare
pennyloaf
from
the
field
jane
removal
had
caused
her
no
little
irritation
the
hours
of
evening
were
heavy
on
her
hands
and
this
new
emotion
was
not
unwelcome
as
a
temporary
resource
as
he
came
home
from
work
one
monday
towards
the
end
of
april
bob
encountered
pennyloaf
she
had
a
bundle
in
her
hands
and
was
walking
hurriedly
that
you
he
exclaimed
catching
her
by
the
arm
are
you
going
ca
stop
now
i
got
some
things
to
put
away
an
it
nearly
eight
round
to
the
passage
be
there
at
ten
ca
give
no
promise
there
been
such
rows
at
you
know
mother
summonsed
father
this
mornin
i
heard
all
right
come
if
you
can
i
be
there
pennyloaf
hastened
on
she
was
a
meagre
bloodless
girl
of
seventeen
yet
her
features
had
a
certain
charm
that
dolorous
kind
of
prettiness
which
is
often
enough
seen
in
the
london
her
habitual
look
was
one
of
meaningless
surprise
whatever
she
gazed
upon
seemed
a
source
of
astonishment
to
her
and
when
she
laughed
which
was
not
very
often
her
eyes
grew
wider
than
ever
her
attire
was
miserable
but
there
were
signs
that
she
tried
to
keep
it
in
order
the
boots
upon
her
feet
were
sewn
and
patched
into
shapelessness
her
limp
straw
hat
had
just
received
a
new
binding
by
saying
that
she
had
things
put
away
she
meant
that
her
business
was
with
the
pawnbroker
who
could
not
receive
pledges
after
eight
it
wanted
some
ten
minutes
of
the
hour
when
she
entered
a
and
by
an
inner
door
passed
into
one
of
a
series
of
compartments
constructed
before
the
pawnbroker
counter
she
deposited
her
bundle
and
looked
about
for
someone
to
attend
to
her
two
young
men
were
in
sight
both
transacting
business
one
was
conversing
facetiously
with
a
customer
on
the
subject
of
a
pledge
two
or
three
lighted
the
interior
of
the
shop
but
the
boxes
were
in
shadow
there
was
a
strong
musty
odour
the
gloom
the
narrow
compartments
the
low
tones
of
conversation
suggested
stealth
and
shame
pennyloaf
waited
with
many
signs
of
impatience
until
one
of
the
assistants
approached
a
smartly
attired
youth
with
black
hair
greased
into
the
discipline
he
deemed
becoming
with
an
aquiline
nose
a
coarse
mouth
a
large
horseshoe
pin
adorning
his
necktie
and
rings
on
his
fingers
he
caught
hold
of
the
packet
and
threw
it
open
it
consisted
of
a
petticoat
and
the
skirt
of
an
old
dress
what
is
it
he
asked
rubbing
his
tongue
along
his
upper
lip
before
and
after
speaking
an
six
please
sir
he
rolled
the
things
up
again
with
a
practised
turn
of
the
hand
and
said
indifferently
glancing
towards
another
box
sir
we
had
two
shillin
on
the
skirt
not
so
long
ago
pleaded
pennyloaf
with
a
subservient
voice
it
two
shillin
please
do
sir
the
young
man
paid
no
attention
he
was
curling
his
moustache
and
exchanging
a
smile
of
intelligence
with
his
with
respect
to
a
piece
of
business
the
latter
had
in
hand
of
a
sudden
he
turned
and
said
sharply
are
you
goin
to
take
it
or
not
pennyloaf
sighed
and
nodded
a
he
asked
he
fetched
a
cloth
rolled
the
articles
in
it
very
tightly
and
pinned
them
up
then
he
made
out
ticket
and
duplicate
handling
his
pen
with
facile
flourish
and
having
blotted
the
little
piece
of
card
on
a
box
of
sand
a
custom
which
survives
in
this
conservative
profession
he
threw
it
to
the
customer
lastly
he
counted
out
one
shilling
and
five
pence
halfpenny
the
coins
were
sandy
greasy
and
of
scratched
surface
pennyloaf
sped
homewards
she
lived
in
shooter
gardens
a
picturesque
locality
which
demolition
and
rebuilding
have
of
late
transformed
it
was
a
winding
alley
with
paving
raised
a
foot
above
the
level
of
the
street
whence
was
its
main
approach
to
enter
from
the
obscurer
end
you
descended
a
flight
of
steps
under
a
low
archway
in
a
court
itself
not
easily
discovered
from
without
only
a
glimpse
of
the
gardens
was
obtainable
the
houses
curved
out
of
sight
after
the
first
few
yards
and
left
surmise
to
busy
itself
with
the
characteristics
of
the
hidden
portion
a
stranger
bold
enough
to
explore
would
have
discovered
that
the
gardens
had
a
blind
offshoot
known
simply
as
court
needless
to
burden
description
with
further
detail
the
slum
was
like
any
other
slum
filth
rottenness
evil
odours
possessed
these
dens
of
superfluous
mankind
and
made
them
gruesome
to
the
peering
imagination
the
inhabitants
of
course
felt
nothing
of
the
sort
a
room
in
gardens
was
the
only
kind
of
home
that
most
of
them
knew
or
desired
the
majority
preferred
it
on
all
grounds
to
that
offered
them
in
a
block
of
model
lodgings
not
very
far
away
here
was
independence
that
is
to
say
the
liberty
to
be
as
vile
as
they
pleased
how
they
came
to
love
vileness
well
that
is
quite
another
matter
and
shall
not
for
the
present
concern
us
pennyloaf
ran
into
the
jaws
of
this
black
horror
with
the
indifference
of
habit
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
the
gardens
were
fearful
in
the
night
gloom
nor
even
that
better
lighting
would
have
been
a
convenience
did
it
happen
that
she
awoke
from
her
first
sleep
with
the
ring
of
ghastly
shrieking
in
her
ears
that
was
an
incident
of
too
common
occurrence
to
cause
her
more
than
a
brief
curiosity
she
could
wait
till
the
morning
to
hear
who
had
whom
four
days
ago
it
was
her
own
mother
turn
to
be
pounded
into
insensibility
her
father
a
journeyman
baker
often
working
nineteen
hours
out
of
the
which
probably
did
not
improve
his
temper
maddened
by
his
wife
persistent
drunkenness
was
stopped
just
on
the
safe
side
of
murder
to
the
amazement
and
indignation
of
the
gardens
candy
prosecuted
her
sovereign
lord
the
case
had
been
heard
and
candy
had
been
cast
in
a
fine
the
money

paid
and
the
baker
went
his
way
remarking
that
his
family
were
to
him
back
when
they
saw
him
candy
on
her
return
was
hooted
through
all
the
length
of
the
gardens
a
demonstration
of
public
feeling
probably
rather
of
base
than
of
worthy
significance
as
pennyloaf
drew
near
to
the
house
a
wild
discordant
voice
suddenly
broke
forth
somewhere
in
the
darkness
singing
in
a
high
key
ye
works
of
the
lord
bless
ye
the
lord
praise
him
and
magnify
him
for
ever
it
was
mad
jack
who
had
his
dwelling
in
the
court
and
at
all
hours
was
wont
to
practise
the
psalmody
which
made
him
notorious
throughout
clerkenwell
a
burst
of
laughter
followed
from
a
group
of
men
and
boys
gathered
near
the
archway
unheeding
the
girl
passed
in
at
an
open
door
and
felt
her
way
up
a
staircase
the
air
was
noisome
notwithstanding
a
fierce
draught
which
swept
down
the
stairs
she
entered
a
room
lighted
by
a
small
metal
lamp
hanging
on
the
wall
a
precaution
of
pennyloaf
own
contrivance
there
was
no
bed
but
one
mattress
lay
with
a
few
rags
of
spread
upon
it
and
two
others
were
rolled
up
in
a
corner
this
chamber
accommodated
under
ordinary
circumstances
four
persons
and
candy
pennyloaf
and
a
son
named
stephen
whose
years
were
eighteen
stephen
pursued
the
occupation
of
a
potman
his
hours
were
from
eight
in
the
morning
till
midnight
on
and
on
sunday
the
time
during
which
a
is
permitted
to
be
open
once
a
month
he
was
allowed
freedom
after
six
against
the
window
was
hung
an
old
shawl
pierced
with
many
rents
by
the
fire
sat
candy
she
leaned
forward
her
head
which
was
bound
in
linen
swathes
resting
upon
her
hands
have
you
got
she
asked
in
the
thick
voice
of
a
drunkard
without
moving
it
all
they
give
me
the
woman
cursed
in
her
throat
but
exhibited
no
anger
with
pennyloaf
an
get
some
tea
an
milk
she
said
after
a
pause
is
sugar
an
bring
seven
o
coals
there
only
a
dust
she
pointed
to
a
deal
box
which
stood
by
the
hearth
pennyloaf
went
out
again
over
the
fireplace
the
stained
wall
bore
certain
singular
ornaments
these
were
five
coloured
cards
such
as
are
signed
by
one
who
takes
a
pledge
of
total
abstinence
each
presented
the
signature
candy
and
it
was
noticeable
that
at
each
progressive
date
the
handwriting
had
become
more
unsteady
yes
five
times
had
maria
candy
promised
with
the
help
of
god
to
abstain
each
time
she
was
in
earnest
but
it
appeared
that
the
help
of
god
availed
little
against
the
views
of
one
green
who
kept
the
in
rosoman
street
once
peckover
and
who
could
on
no
account
afford
to
lose
so
good
a
customer
for
many
years
that
house
licensed
for
the
sale
of
liquors
had
been
working
candy
ruin
not
a
particle
of
her
frame
but
was
vitiated
by
the
drugs
retailed
there
under
the
approving
smile
of
civilisation
spirits
would
have
been
harmless
in
comparison
the
advantage
of
green
ale
was
that
the
very
first
gave
conscience
its
bemuddling
sop
for
a
penny
you
forgot
all
the
cares
of
existence
for
threepence
you
became
a
yelling
maniac
poor
poor
creature
she
was
sober
sitting
over
the
fire
with
her
face
battered
into
shapelessness
and
now
that
her
fury
had
had
its
way
she
bitterly
repented
invoking
the
help
of
the
law
against
her
husband
what
use
what
use
perhaps
he
had
now
abandoned
her
for
good
and
it
was
certain
that
the
fear
of
him
was
the
only
thing
that
ever
checked
her
on
the
ruinous
road
she
would
so
willingly
have
quitted
but
for
the
harm
to
himself
the
only
pity
was
he
had
not
taken
her
life
outright
she
knew
all
the
hatefulness
of
her
existence
she
knew
also
that
only
the
grave
would
rescue
her
from
it
the
struggle
was
too
unequal
between
candy
with
her
appeal
to
providence
and
green
with
the
forces
of
civilisation
at
her
back
pennyloaf
speedily
returned
with
a
of
milk
a
pennyworth
of
tea
and
seven
pounds
also
price
one
penny
of
coals
in
an
apron
it
was
very
seldom
indeed
that
the
candys
had
more
of
anything
in
their
room
than
would
last
them
for
the
current
day
there
being
no
kettle
water
was
put
on
to
boil
in
a
tin
saucepan
the
tea
was
made
in
a
jug
pennyloaf
had
always
been
a
good
girl
to
her
mother
she
tended
her
as
well
as
she
could
but
there
was
no
word
of
affection
from
either
kindly
speech
was
stifled
by
the
atmosphere
of
gardens
having
drunk
her
tea
candy
lay
down
as
she
was
on
the
already
extended
mattress
and
drew
the
ragged
coverings
about
her
in
half
an
hour
she
slept
pennyloaf
then
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
again
and
left
the
house
she
walked
away
from
the
denser
regions
of
clerkenwell
came
to
wells
theatre
gloomy
in
its
profitless
recollection
of
the
last
worthy
manager
that
london
knew
and
there
turned
into
myddelton
passage
it
is
a
narrow
paved
walk
between
brick
walls
seven
feet
high
on
the
one
hand
lies
the
new
river
head
on
the
other
are
small
gardens
behind
myddelton
square
the
branches
of
a
few
trees
hang
over
there
are
doors
seemingly
never
opened
belonging
one
to
each
garden
a
couple
of
shed
feeble
light
pennyloaf
paced
the
length
of
the
passage
several
times
meeting
no
one
then
a
policeman
came
along
with
echoing
tread
and
eyed
her
suspiciously
she
had
to
wait
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
bob
hewett
made
his
appearance
greeting
her
with
a
nod
and
a
laugh
he
took
up
a
leaning
position
against
the
wall
and
began
to
put
questions
concerning
the
state
of
things
at
her
home
what
your
mother
do
if
the
old
man
do
give
her
nothing
to
live
on
he
inquired
when
he
had
listened
to
the
recital
of
domestic
difficulties
knew
replied
the
girl
shaking
her
head
the
habitual
surprise
of
her
countenance
becoming
a
blank
interrogation
of
destiny
bob
kept
kicking
the
wall
first
with
one
heel
then
with
the
other
he
whistled
a
few
bars
of
the
last
song
he
had
learnt
at
the
penny
he
remarked
at
length
with
something
of
shamefacedness
a
namesake
of
mine
here
as
i
sha
miss
if
you
can
do
any
good
with
it
he
held
a
shilling
towards
her
under
his
hand
pennyloaf
turned
away
casting
down
her
eyes
and
looking
troubled
can
get
on
for
a
bit
she
said
indistinctly
bob
returned
the
coin
to
his
pocket
he
whistled
again
for
a
moment
then
asked
abruptly
have
you
seen
clem
again
replied
the
girl
examining
him
with
sudden
acuteness
about
her
much
she
got
her
back
up
a
bit
that
all
me
pennyloaf
asked
anxiously
bob
nodded
as
he
was
making
some
further
remarks
on
the
subject
a
man
figure
appeared
at
a
little
distance
and
almost
immediately
withdrew
again
round
a
winding
of
the
passage
a
moment
after
there
sounded
from
that
direction
a
shrill
whistle
bob
and
the
girl
regarded
each
other
was
that
said
the
former
suspiciously
half
believe
it
was
jeck
bartley
if
jeck
is
up
to
any
of
his
larks
i
make
him
remember
it
you
wait
here
a
minute
he
walked
at
a
sharp
pace
towards
the
suspected
quarter
scarcely
had
he
gone
half
a
dozen
yards
when
there
came
running
from
the
other
end
of
the
passage
a
girl
whom
pennyloaf
at
once
recognised
it
was
clem
peckover
with
some
friend
assistance
she
had
evidently
tracked
the
couple
and
was
now
springing
out
of
ambush
she
rushed
upon
pennyloaf
who
for
very
alarm
could
not
flee
and
attacked
her
with
clenched
fists
a
scream
of
terror
and
pain
caused
bob
to
turn
and
run
back
pennyloaf
could
not
even
ward
off
the
blows
that
descended
upon
her
head
she
was
pinned
against
the
wall
her
hat
was
torn
away
her
hair
began
to
fly
in
disorder
but
bob
effected
a
speedy
rescue
he
gripped
clem
muscular
arms
and
forced
them
behind
her
back
as
if
he
meant
to
dismember
her
even
then
it
was
with
no
slight
effort
that
he
restrained
the
girl
fury
run
off
he
shouted
to
pennyloaf
she
tries
this
on
again
i
murder
her
pennyloaf
hysterical
cries
and
the
frantic
invectives
of
her
assailant
made
the
passage
ring
again
bob
roared
to
the
former
to
be
off
and
was
at
length
obeyed
when
pennyloaf
was
out
of
sight
he
released
clem
her
twisted
arms
caused
her
such
pain
that
she
threw
herself
against
the
wall
mingling
maledictions
with
groans
bob
burst
into
scornful
laughter
clem
went
home
vowing
vengeance
in
the
nether
world
this
trifling
dissension
might
have
been
expected
to
bear
its
crop
of
violent
language
and
straightway
pass
into
oblivion
but
miss
malevolence
was
of
no
common
stamp
and
the
scene
of
originated
a
feud
which
in
the
end
concerned
many
more
people
than
those
immediately
interested
chapter
ix
pathological
through
the
day
and
through
the
evening
clara
hewett
had
her
place
behind
tubbs
bar
for
daylight
wear
the
dress
which
had
formerly
been
her
best
was
deemed
sufficient
it
was
simple
but
not
badly
made
and
became
her
figure
her
evening
attire
was
provided
by
tubbs
who
recouped
herself
by
withholding
the
promised
wages
for
a
certain
number
of
weeks
when
clara
had
surveyed
this
garment
in
the
bar
mirror
she
turned
away
contemptuously
the
material
was
cheap
the
mode
vulgar
it
must
be
borne
with
for
the
present
like
other
indignities
which
she
found
to
be
inseparable
from
her
position
as
soon
as
her
employer
claim
was
satisfied
and
the
weekly
five
shillings
began
to
be
paid
clara
remembered
the
promise
she
had
volunteered
to
her
father
but
john
was
once
more
at
work
for
the
present
there
really
seemed
no
need
to
give
him
any
of
her
money
and
she
herself
on
the
other
hand
lacked
so
many
things
this
dress
plainly
would
not
be
suitable
for
the
better
kind
of
engagement
she
had
in
view
it
behoved
her
first
of
all
to
have
one
made
in
accordance
with
her
own
taste
a
mantle
too
a
silk
umbrella
gloves
it
would
be
unjust
to
herself
to
share
her
scanty
earnings
with
those
at
home
yes
but
you
must
try
to
understand
this
girl
of
the
people
with
her
unfortunate
endowment
of
brains
and
defect
of
tenderness
that
smile
of
hers
which
touched
and
fascinated
and
made
thoughtful
had
of
course
a
significance
discoverable
by
study
of
her
life
and
character
it
was
no
mere
affectation
she
was
not
conscious
in
smiling
of
the
expression
upon
her
face
moreover
there
was
justice
in
the
sense
of
wrong
discernible
upon
her
features
when
the
very
self
looked
forth
from
them
all
through
his
life
john
hewett
had
suffered
from
the
same
impulse
of
revolt
less
sensitively
constructed
than
his
daughter
uncalculating
inarticulate
he
fumed
and
fretted
away
his
energies
in
a
conflict
with
forces
ludicrously
personified
in
the
matter
of
his
second
marriage
he
was
seen
at
his
best
generously
defiant
of
social
cruelties
but
was
denied
him
and
circumstances
condemned
his
life
to
futility
clara
inherited
his
temperament
transferred
to
her
more
complex
nature
it
gained
in
subtlety
and
in
power
of
but
lost
in
its
nobler
elements
her
mother
was
a
capable
and
ambitious
woman
one
in
whom
active
characteristics
were
more
prominent
than
the
emotional
with
such
parents
every
probability
told
against
her
patient
acceptance
of
a
lot
which
allowed
her
faculties
no
scope
and
the
circumstances
of
her
childhood
were
such
as
added
a
peculiar
bitterness
to
the
trials
waiting
upon
her
maturity
clara
you
remember
had
reached
her
eleventh
year
when
her
brother
died
and
left
the
legacy
of
which
came
so
little
profit
that
was
in
state
education
had
recently
made
a
show
of
establishing
itself
and
in
the
hewetts
world
much
argument
was
going
on
with
reference
to
the
new
board
schools
and
their
advantages
or
disadvantages
when
compared
with
those
in
which
children
had
hitherto
been
taught
clara
went
to
a
church
school
and
the
expense
was
greater
than
the
new
system
rendered
necessary
her
father
principles
naturally
favoured
education
on
an
independent
basis
but
a
prejudice
then
and
still
common
among
workpeople
of
decent
habits
made
him
hesitate
about
sending
his
girl
to
sit
side
by
side
with
the
children
of
the
street
and
he
was
confirmed
by
own
view
of
the
matter
she
spoke
with
much
contempt
of
board
schools
and
gave
it
to
be
understood
that
her
religious
convictions
would
not
suffer
her
to
be
taught
by
those
who
made
light
of
orthodoxy
this
attitude
was
intelligible
enough
in
a
child
of
sharp
wit
and
abundant
notwithstanding
her
father
indifferentism
little
clara
perceived
that
a
regard
for
religion
gave
her
a
certain
distinction
at
home
and
elsewhere
placed
her
apart
from
girls
she
was
subject
also
to
special
influences
on
the
one
hand
from
her
favourite
teacher
miss
harrop
on
the
other
from
a
grace
rudd
miss
harrop
was
a
good
woman
of
about
thirty
one
of
those
unhappy
persons
who
are
made
for
domestic
life
but
condemned
by
fate
to
lonely
and
impulsive
she
drew
to
herself
the
most
interesting
girl
in
her
classes
and
with
complete
indiscretion
made
a
familiar
a
pet
a
prodigy
of
one
whose
especial
need
was
discipline
by
her
confidences
and
her
flatteries
she
set
clara
aflame
with
spiritual
pride
ceaselessly
she
excited
her
to
ambition
remarked
on
her
gifts
made
dazzling
forecast
of
her
future
clara
was
to
be
a
teacher
first
of
all
but
only
that
she
might
be
introduced
to
the
notice
of
people
who
would
aid
her
to
better
things
and
the
child
came
to
regard
this
as
the
course
inevitably
before
her
had
she
not
already
received
among
them
a
little
volume
religious
knowledge
did
she
not
win
universal
applause
when
she
recited
a
piece
of
verse
on
miss
harrop
disastrous
kindness
even
saying
that
the
delivery
reminded
her
of
the
celebrated
actress
grace
rudd
was
busy
in
the
same
fatal
work
four
years
older
than
clara
weakly
pretty
sentimental
conceited
she
had
a
fancy
for
patronising
the
clever
child
to
the
end
that
she
might
receive
homage
in
return
poor
grace
she
left
school
spent
a
year
or
two
at
home
with
parents
as
foolish
as
herself
and
disappeared
prior
to
that
miss
harrop
had
also
passed
out
of
clara
ken
driven
by
restlessness
to
try
another
school
away
from
london
these
losses
appeared
to
affect
clara
unfavourably
she
began
to
neglect
her
books
to
be
insubordinate
to
exhibit
arrogance
which
brought
down
upon
her
plenty
of
wholesome
reproof
her
father
was
not
without
a
share
in
the
responsibility
for
it
all
entering
upon
his
four
hundred
pounds
one
of
the
first
things
john
did
was
to
hire
a
piano
that
his
child
might
be
taught
to
play
pity
that
sidney
kirkwood
could
not
then
cry
with
effective
emphasis
are
the
working
classes
we
are
the
lower
orders
it
was
exactly
what
hewett
would
not
bring
himself
to
understand
what
his
clara
must
be
robbed
of
chances
just
because
her
birth
was
not
that
of
a
young
lady
nay
by
all
the
unintelligible
powers
she
should
enjoy
every
help
that
he
could
possibly
afford
her
bless
her
bright
face
and
her
clever
tongue
yes
it
was
now
a
settled
thing
that
she
should
be
trained
for
a
schoolteacher
an
atmosphere
of
refinement
must
be
made
for
her
she
must
be
better
dressed
more
delicately
fed
the
bitter
injustice
of
it
in
the
outcome
you
are
already
instructed
long
before
clara
was
anything
like
ready
to
enter
upon
a
career
her
father
once
more
darkened
over
the
home
clara
had
made
no
progress
since
miss
harrop
day
the
authorities
directing
her
school
might
have
come
forward
with
aid
of
some
kind
had
it
appeared
to
them
that
the
girl
would
repay
such
trouble
but
they
had
their
forebodings
about
her
whenever
she
chose
she
could
learn
in
five
minutes
what
another
girl
could
scarcely
commit
to
memory
in
twenty
but
it
was
obviously
for
the
sake
of
display
the
teachers
disliked
her
among
the
pupils
she
had
no
friends
so
at
length
there
came
the
farewell
to
school
and
the
beginning
of
practical
life
which
took
the
shape
of
learning
to
stamp
crests
and
addresses
on
there
was
hope
that
before
long
clara
might
earn
thirteen
shillings
a
week
the
bitter
injustice
of
it
clara
was
seventeen
now
and
understood
the
folly
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
a
few
years
ago
but
at
the
same
time
she
felt
in
her
inmost
heart
the
tyranny
of
a
world
which
takes
revenge
for
errors
that
are
inevitable
which
misleads
a
helpless
child
and
then
condemns
it
for
being
found
astray
she
could
judge
herself
yes
better
than
sidney
kirkwood
could
judge
her
she
knew
her
defects
knew
her
vices
and
a
feud
with
fate
caused
her
to
accept
them
defiantly
many
a
time
had
she
sobbed
out
to
herself
wish
i
could
neither
read
nor
write
i
wish
i
had
never
been
told
that
there
is
anything
better
than
to
work
with
one
hands
and
earn
daily
bread
but
she
could
not
renounce
the
claims
that
nature
had
planted
in
her
that
her
guardians
had
fostered
the
better
she
understood
how
difficult
was
every
way
of
advancement
the
more
fiercely
resolute
was
she
to
conquer
satisfactions
which
seemed
beyond
the
sphere
of
her
destiny
of
late
she
had
thought
much
of
her
childish
successes
in
reciting
poetry
it
was
not
often
that
she
visited
a
theatre
her
father
had
always
refused
to
let
her
go
with
any
one
save
himself
or
sidney
but
on
the
rare
occasions
when
her
wish
was
gratified
she
had
watched
each
actress
with
devouring
interest
with
burning
envy
and
had
said
to
herself
i
soon
learn
to
do
as
well
as
that
ca
i
see
where
it
might
be
made
more
lifelike
why
should
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
go
on
the
stage
in
passing
a
where
photographs
were
exposed
she
looked
for
those
of
actresses
and
gazed
at
them
with
terrible
intensity
am
as
as
she
is
why
should
portrait
be
seen
some
day
in
the
windows
and
then
her
heart
throbbed
smitten
with
passionate
desire
as
she
walked
on
there
was
a
turbid
gloom
about
her
and
in
her
ears
the
echoing
of
a
dread
temptation
of
all
this
she
spoke
to
nobody
for
she
had
no
friends
a
couple
of
years
ago
something
like
an
intimacy
had
sprung
up
between
her
and
bessie
jones
since
married
and
become
bessie
byass
seemingly
on
the
principle
of
contrast
in
association
bessie
like
most
london
workgirls
was
fond
of
the
theatre
and
her
talk
helped
to
nourish
the
ambition
which
was
secretly
developing
in
clara
but
the
two
could
not
long
harmonise
bessie
just
after
her
marriage
ventured
to
speak
with
friendly
reproof
of
behaviour
to
sidney
kirkwood
clara
was
not
disposed
to
admit
freedoms
of
that
kind
she
half
gave
it
to
be
understood
that
though
others
might
be
easily
satisfied
she
had
views
of
her
own
on
such
subjects
thereafter
byass
grew
decidedly
cool
the
other
girls
with
whom
clara
had
formal
intercourse
showed
no
desire
to
win
her
confidence
they
were
kept
aloof
by
her
reticent
civility
as
for
sidney
himself
it
was
not
without
reason
that
he
had
seen
encouragement
in
the
girl
first
reply
to
his
advances
at
sixteen
clara
found
it
agreeable
to
have
her
good
graces
sought
by
the
one
man
in
whom
she
recognised
superiority
of
mind
and
purpose
of
all
the
unbetrothed
girls
she
knew
not
one
but
would
have
felt
flattered
had
kirkwood
thus
distinguished
her
nothing
common
adhered
to
his
demeanour
to
his
character
he
had
the
look
of
one
who
will
hold
his
own
in
life
his
word
had
the
ring
of
truth
of
his
generosity
she
had
innumerable
proofs
and
it
contrasted
nobly
with
the
selfishness
of
young
men
as
she
knew
them
she
appreciated
it
all
the
more
because
her
own
frequent
desire
to
be
unselfish
was
so
fruitless
of
awakening
tenderness
towards
him
she
knew
nothing
but
she
gave
him
smiles
and
words
which
might
mean
little
or
much
just
for
the
pleasure
of
completing
a
conquest
nor
did
she
in
truth
then
regard
it
as
impossible
that
sooner
or
later
she
might
become
his
wife
if
she
marry
a
workman
assuredly
it
should
be
sidney
he
thought
so
highly
of
her
he
understood
things
in
her
to
which
the
ordinary
artisan
would
have
been
dead
he
had
little
delicacies
of
homage
which
gave
her
keen
pleasure
and
yet
well
time
enough
time
went
very
quickly
and
changed
both
herself
and
sidney
in
ways
she
could
not
foresee
it
was
true
all
he
said
to
her
in
anger
that
night
by
the
prison
wall
true
and
deserved
every
word
of
it
even
in
acknowledging
that
she
hardened
herself
against
him
implacably
since
he
chose
to
take
this
tone
with
her
to
throw
aside
all
his
graceful
blindness
to
her
faults
he
had
only
himself
to
blame
if
she
considered
everything
at
an
end
between
them
she
tried
to
believe
herself
glad
this
had
happened
it
relieved
her
from
an
embarrassment
and
made
her
absolutely
free
to
pursue
the
ambitions
which
now
gave
her
no
rest
for
all
that
she
could
not
dismiss
sidney
from
her
mind
indeed
throughout
the
week
that
followed
their
parting
she
thought
of
him
more
persistently
than
for
many
months
that
he
would
before
long
seek
pardon
for
his
rudeness
she
felt
certain
she
felt
also
that
such
submission
would
gratify
her
in
a
high
degree
but
the
weeks
were
passing
and
no
letter
came
in
vain
she
glanced
from
the
window
of
the
bar
at
the
faces
which
moved
by
even
on
sunday
when
she
went
home
for
an
hour
or
two
she
neither
saw
nor
heard
of
kirkwood
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
ask
a
question
under
any
circumstances
clara
would
ill
have
borne
a
suspense
that
irritated
her
pride
and
at
present
she
lived
amid
conditions
so
repugnant
that
her
nerves
were
ceaselessly
strung
almost
beyond
endurance
before
entering
upon
this
engagement
she
had
formed
but
an
imperfect
notion
of
what
would
be
demanded
of
her
to
begin
with
tubbs
belonged
to
the
order
of
women
who
are
by
nature
though
it
was
her
interest
to
secure
clara
for
a
permanency
she
began
by
exacting
from
the
girl
as
much
labour
as
could
possibly
be
included
in
their
agreement
the
hours
were
insufferably
long
by
nine
each
evening
clara
was
so
outworn
that
with
difficulty
she
remained
standing
yet
not
until
midnight
was
she
released
the
unchanging
odours
of
the
place
sickened
her
made
her
head
ache
and
robbed
her
of
all
appetite
many
of
the
duties
were
menial
and
to
perform
them
fevered
her
with
indignation
then
the
mere
waiting
upon
such
men
as
formed
the
majority
of
the
customers
vulgarly
familiar
when
not
insolent
in
their
speech
to
her
was
hateful
beyond
anything
she
had
conceived
had
there
been
no
one
to
face
but
her
father
she
would
have
returned
home
and
resumed
her
old
occupation
at
the
end
of
the
first
fortnight
so
extreme
was
her
suffering
in
mind
and
body
but
rather
than
give
sidney
kirkwood
such
a
triumph
she
would
work
on
and
breathe
no
word
of
what
she
underwent
even
in
her
anger
against
him
the
knowledge
of
his
forgiving
disposition
of
the
sincerity
of
his
love
was
an
unavowed
support
she
knew
he
could
not
utterly
desert
her
when
some
day
he
sought
a
reconciliation
the
renewal
of
conflict
between
his
pride
and
her
own
would
she
felt
supply
her
with
new
courage
early
one
saturday
afternoon
she
was
standing
by
the
windows
partly
from
heavy
idleness
of
thought
partly
on
the
chance
that
kirkwood
might
go
by
when
a
young
man
who
happened
to
be
passing
at
a
slow
walk
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
her
he
went
on
but
in
a
few
moments
clara
who
had
moved
back
into
the
shop
saw
him
enter
and
come
forwards
he
took
a
seat
at
the
counter
and
ordered
a
luncheon
clara
waited
upon
him
with
her
customary
cold
reserve
and
he
made
no
remark
until
she
returned
him
change
out
of
the
coin
he
offered
then
he
said
with
an
apologetic
smile
are
old
acquaintances
miss
hewett
but
i
afraid
you
forgotten
me
clara
regarded
him
in
astonishment
his
age
seemed
to
be
something
short
of
thirty
he
had
a
long
grave
intelligent
face
smiled
enigmatically
spoke
in
a
rather
slow
voice
his
silk
hat
sober
necktie
drawn
through
a
gold
ring
and
dark
made
it
probable
that
he
was
the
city
used
to
know
each
other
very
well
about
five
years
ago
he
pursued
pocketing
his
change
carelessly
you
remember
a
scawthorne
who
used
to
be
a
lodger
with
some
friends
of
yours
called
rudd
on
the
instant
memory
revived
in
clara
in
her
schooldays
she
often
spent
a
sunday
afternoon
with
grace
rudd
and
this
scawthorne
was
generally
at
the
and
rudd
made
much
of
him
said
that
he
held
a
most
important
post
in
a
lawyer
office
doubtless
had
private
designs
concerning
him
and
their
daughter
thus
aided
she
even
recognised
his
features
you
knew
me
again
after
all
this
time
is
an
easy
face
to
forget
replied
scawthorne
with
the
subdued
polite
smile
which
naturally
accompanied
his
tone
of
unemotional
intimacy
tell
you
the
whole
truth
however
i
happened
to
hear
news
of
you
a
few
days
ago
i
met
grace
rudd
she
told
me
you
were
here
some
old
friend
had
told
grace
name
awoke
keen
interest
in
clara
she
was
startled
to
hear
it
and
did
not
venture
to
make
the
inquiry
her
mind
at
once
suggested
scawthorne
observed
her
for
an
instant
then
proceeded
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
grace
rudd
was
on
the
stage
she
had
been
acting
in
provincial
theatres
under
the
name
of
miss
danvers
and
was
now
waiting
for
a
promised
engagement
at
a
minor
london
theatre
you
often
go
to
the
theatre
he
added
carelessly
have
a
great
many
acquaintances
connected
with
the
stage
in
one
way
or
another
if
you
would
like
i
should
be
very
glad
to
send
you
tickets
now
and
then
i
always
have
more
given
me
than
i
can
well
use
clara
thanked
him
rather
coldly
and
said
that
she
was
very
seldom
free
in
the
evening
thereupon
scawthorne
again
smiled
raised
his
hat
and
departed
possibly
he
had
some
consciousness
of
the
effect
of
his
words
but
it
needed
a
subtler
insight
a
finer
imagination
than
his
to
interpret
the
pale
beautiful
harassed
face
which
studiously
avoided
looking
towards
him
as
he
paused
before
stepping
out
on
to
the
pavement
the
rest
of
the
evening
the
hours
of
night
that
followed
passed
for
clara
in
hot
tumult
of
heart
and
brain
the
news
of
grace
rudd
had
flashed
upon
her
as
revelation
of
a
clear
possibility
where
hitherto
she
had
seen
only
mocking
phantoms
of
futile
desire
grace
was
an
actress
no
matter
by
what
course
to
this
she
had
attained
this
man
scawthorne
spoke
of
the
theatrical
life
as
one
to
whom
all
its
details
were
familiar
acquaintance
with
him
of
a
sudden
bridged
over
the
chasm
which
had
seemed
impassable
would
he
come
again
to
see
her
had
her
involuntary
reserve
put
an
end
to
any
interest
he
might
have
felt
in
her
of
him
personally
she
thought
not
at
all
she
could
not
have
recalled
his
features
he
was
a
mere
abstraction
the
representative
of
a
wild
hope
which
his
conversation
had
inspired
from
that
day
the
character
of
her
suffering
was
altered
it
became
less
womanly
it
defied
weakness
and
grew
to
a
fever
of
fierce
unscrupulous
rebellion
whenever
she
thought
of
sidney
kirkwood
the
injury
he
was
inflicting
upon
her
pride
rankled
into
bitter
resentment
unsoftened
by
the
despairing
thought
of
which
had
at
times
visited
her
sick
weariness
she
bore
her
degradations
with
the
sullen
indifference
of
one
who
is
supported
by
the
hope
of
a
future
revenge
the
disease
inherent
in
her
being
that
deadly
outcome
of
social
tyranny
which
perverts
the
generous
elements
of
youth
into
mere
seeds
of
destruction
developed
day
by
day
blighting
her
heart
corrupting
her
moral
sense
even
setting
marks
of
evil
upon
the
beauty
of
her
countenance
a
passionate
desire
of
familiarised
her
with
projects
with
ideas
which
formerly
she
had
glanced
at
only
to
dismiss
as
ignoble
in
proportion
as
her
bodily
health
failed
the
worst
possibilities
of
her
character
came
into
prominence
like
a
creature
that
is
beset
by
unrelenting
forces
she
summoned
and
surveyed
all
the
craft
faculties
lurking
in
the
dark
places
of
her
nature
theoretic
y
she
had
now
accepted
every
debasing
compact
by
which
a
woman
can
spite
herself
on
the
world
injustice
to
be
no
longer
an
unregarded
atom
in
the
mass
of
those
who
are
born
only
to
labour
for
others
to
find
play
for
the
strength
and
the
passion
which
by
no
choice
of
her
own
distinguished
her
from
the
tame
slave
sometimes
in
the
silence
of
night
she
suffered
from
a
dreadful
need
of
crying
aloud
of
uttering
her
anguish
in
a
scream
like
that
of
insanity
she
stifled
it
only
by
crushing
her
face
into
the
pillow
until
the
hysterical
fit
had
passed
and
she
lay
like
one
dead
a
fortnight
after
his
first
visit
scawthorne
again
presented
himself
polite
smiling
perhaps
rather
more
familiar
he
stayed
talking
for
nearly
an
hour
chiefly
of
the
theatre
casually
he
mentioned
that
grace
rudd
had
got
her
engagement
only
a
little
part
in
a
farce
suppose
clara
came
to
see
her
play
some
evening
might
he
take
her
he
could
at
any
time
have
places
in
the
clara
accepted
the
invitation
she
did
so
without
consulting
tubbs
and
when
it
became
necessary
to
ask
for
the
evening
freedom
difficulties
were
made
well
said
clara
in
a
tone
she
had
never
yet
used
to
her
employer
i
shall
leave
you
she
spoke
without
a
moment
reflection
something
independent
of
her
will
seemed
to
direct
her
in
speech
and
act
tubbs
yielded
clara
had
not
yet
been
able
to
obtain
the
dress
she
wished
for
her
savings
however
were
sufficient
for
the
purchase
of
a
few
accessories
which
made
her
she
considered
not
unpresentable
scawthorne
was
to
have
a
cab
waiting
for
her
at
a
little
distance
from
the
it
was
now
june
and
at
the
hour
of
their
meeting
still
broad
daylight
but
clara
cared
nothing
for
the
chance
that
acquaintances
might
see
her
nay
she
had
a
reckless
desire
that
sidney
kirkwood
might
pass
just
at
this
moment
she
noticed
no
one
whom
she
knew
however
but
just
as
the
cab
was
turning
into
pentonville
road
scawthorne
drew
her
attention
to
a
person
on
the
pavement
see
that
old
fellow
he
said
you
believe
that
he
is
very
wealthy
clara
had
just
time
to
perceive
an
old
man
with
white
hair
dressed
as
a
mechanic
i
know
him
she
replied
name
snowdon
it
is
how
do
you
come
to
know
him
scawthorne
inquired
with
interest
she
explained
not
say
anything
about
it
remarked
her
companion
an
eccentric
chap
i
happen
to
know
his
affairs
in
the
way
of
business
i
ought
to
have
told
secrets
but
i
can
trust
you
a
gentle
emphasis
on
the
last
word
and
a
smile
of
more
than
usual
intimacy
but
his
manner
was
and
remained
through
the
evening
respectful
almost
to
exaggeration
clara
seemed
scarcely
conscious
of
his
presence
save
in
the
act
of
listening
to
what
he
said
she
never
met
his
look
never
smiled
from
entering
the
theatre
to
leaving
it
she
had
a
high
flush
on
her
face
impossible
to
recognise
her
friend
in
the
actress
whom
scawthorne
indicated
features
and
voice
were
wholly
strange
to
her
in
the
intervals
scawthorne
spoke
of
the
difficulties
that
beset
an
actress
career
at
its
beginning
suppose
you
never
thought
of
trying
it
he
asked
i
fancy
you
might
do
well
if
only
you
could
have
a
few
months
training
just
to
start
you
of
course
it
all
depends
on
knowing
how
to
go
about
it
a
little
money
would
be
necessary
not
much
clara
made
no
reply
on
the
way
home
she
was
mute
scawthorne
took
leave
of
her
in
upper
street
and
promised
to
look
in
again
before
long
under
the
heat
of
these
summer
days
in
the
reeking
atmosphere
of
the
bar
clara
panted
the
weeks
went
on
what
strength
supported
her
from
the
monday
morning
to
the
saturday
midnight
she
could
not
tell
acting
and
refraining
speaking
and
holding
silence
these
things
were
no
longer
the
consequences
of
her
own
volition
she
wished
to
break
free
from
her
slavery
but
had
not
the
force
to
do
so
something
held
her
voice
as
often
as
she
was
about
to
tell
tubbs
that
this
week
would
be
the
last
her
body
wasted
so
that
all
the
garments
she
wore
were
loose
upon
her
the
only
mental
process
of
which
she
was
capable
was
reviewing
the
misery
of
days
just
past
and
anticipating
that
of
the
days
to
come
her
only
feelings
were
infinite
and
a
dull
smouldering
hatred
of
all
others
in
the
world
a
doctor
would
have
bidden
her
take
to
bed
as
one
in
danger
of
grave
illness
she
bore
through
it
without
change
in
her
habits
and
in
time
the
strange
lethargy
passed
scawthorne
came
to
the
bar
frequently
he
remarked
often
on
her
look
of
suffering
and
urged
a
holiday
at
length
near
the
end
of
july
he
invited
her
to
go
up
the
river
with
him
on
the
coming
clara
consented
though
aware
that
her
presence
would
be
more
than
ever
necessary
at
the
bar
on
the
day
of
much
drinking
later
in
the
evening
she
addressed
her
demand
to
tubbs
it
was
refused
without
a
word
of
anger
clara
went
upstairs
prepared
herself
for
walking
and
set
forth
among
the
of
islington
in
half
an
hour
she
had
found
a
cheap
bedroom
for
which
she
paid
a
week
rent
in
advance
she
purchased
a
few
articles
of
food
and
carried
them
to
her
lodging
then
lay
down
in
the
darkness
chapter
x
the
last
combat
during
these
summer
months
sidney
kirkwood
visits
to
the
house
in
clerkenwell
close
were
comparatively
rare
it
was
not
his
own
wish
to
relax
in
any
degree
the
close
friendship
so
long
subsisting
between
the
hewetts
and
himself
but
from
the
day
of
clara
engagement
with
tubbs
john
hewett
began
to
alter
in
his
treatment
of
him
at
first
there
was
nothing
more
than
found
its
natural
explanation
in
regret
of
what
had
happened
a
tendency
to
muteness
to
troubled
brooding
but
before
long
john
made
it
unmistakable
that
the
young
man
presence
was
irksome
to
him
if
on
coming
home
he
found
sidney
with
hewett
and
the
children
a
cold
nod
was
the
only
greeting
he
offered
then
followed
signs
of
such
as
sidney
could
not
in
the
end
fail
to
interpret
as
unfavourable
to
himself
he
never
heard
clara
name
on
her
father
lips
and
himself
never
uttered
it
when
john
was
in
hearing
told
him
what
passed
between
us
that
night
sidney
argued
inwardly
but
it
was
not
so
hewett
had
merely
abandoned
himself
to
an
unreasonable
resentment
notwithstanding
his
concessions
he
blamed
sidney
for
the
girl
leaving
home
and
as
his
mood
grew
more
irritable
the
more
hopeless
it
seemed
that
clara
would
return
he
nursed
the
suspicion
of
treacherous
behaviour
on
sidney
part
he
would
not
take
into
account
any
such
thing
as
pride
which
could
forbid
the
young
man
to
urge
a
rejected
suit
sidney
had
grown
tired
of
clara
that
was
the
truth
and
gladly
caught
at
any
means
of
excusing
himself
he
had
made
new
friends
peckover
reported
that
he
was
a
constant
visitor
at
the
old
man
snowdon
lodgings
she
expressed
her
belief
that
snowdon
had
come
back
from
australia
with
a
little
store
of
money
and
if
kirkwood
had
knowledge
of
that
would
it
not
explain
his
interest
in
jane
snowdon
shame
to
listen
to
such
things
cried
hewett
angrily
when
her
husband
once
repeated
the
landlady
words
be
ashamed
of
myself
john
if
you
do
know
him
no
better
than
that
you
ought
to
by
this
time
and
john
did
in
fact
take
to
himself
no
little
shame
but
his
unsatisfied
affection
turned
all
the
old
feelings
to
bitterness
in
spite
of
himself
he
blundered
along
the
path
of
perversity
sidney
too
had
his
promptings
of
obstinate
humour
when
he
distinctly
recognised
hewett
feeling
it
galled
him
he
was
being
treated
with
gross
injustice
and
temper
suggested
reprisals
which
could
answer
no
purpose
but
to
torment
him
with
however
he
must
needs
consult
his
own
dignity
he
could
not
keep
defending
himself
against
ignoble
charges
for
the
present
there
was
no
choice
but
to
accept
john
hints
and
hold
apart
as
much
as
was
possible
without
absolute
breach
of
friendly
relations
nor
could
he
bring
himself
to
approach
clara
it
was
often
in
his
mind
to
write
to
her
had
he
obeyed
the
voice
of
his
desire
he
would
have
penned
such
letters
as
only
the
of
a
passionate
lover
can
dictate
but
herein
too
the
strain
of
sternness
that
marked
his
character
made
its
influence
felt
he
said
to
himself
that
the
only
hope
of
clara
respecting
him
lay
in
his
preservation
of
the
attitude
he
had
adopted
and
as
the
months
went
on
he
found
a
bitter
satisfaction
in
adhering
so
firmly
to
his
purpose
the
with
which
no
man
can
dispense
whispered
assurance
that
clara
only
thought
the
more
of
him
the
longer
he
held
aloof
when
the
end
of
july
came
he
definitely
prescribed
to
his
patience
a
trial
of
yet
one
more
month
then
he
would
write
clara
a
long
letter
telling
her
what
it
had
cost
him
to
keep
silence
and
declaring
the
constancy
he
devoted
to
her
this
resolve
he
registered
whilst
at
work
one
morning
the
triumphant
sunshine
refusing
to
be
excluded
even
from
london
workshops
gleamed
upon
his
tools
and
on
the
scraps
of
jewellery
before
him
he
looked
up
to
the
blue
sky
and
thought
with
heavy
heart
of
many
a
lane
in
surrey
and
in
essex
where
he
might
be
wandering
but
for
this
ceaseless
necessity
of
earning
the
week
wage
a
fly
buzzed
loudly
against
the
grimy
window
and
by
one
of
those
associations
which
time
and
change
can
not
affect
he
mused
himself
back
into
boyhood
the
glimpse
before
him
of
john
arch
aided
the
revival
of
old
impressions
his
hand
ceased
from
its
mechanical
activity
and
he
was
absorbed
in
a
waking
dream
when
a
voice
called
to
him
and
said
that
he
was
wanted
he
went
down
to
the
entrance
and
there
found
hewett
her
coming
at
all
was
enough
to
signal
some
disaster
and
the
trouble
on
her
face
caused
sidney
to
regard
her
with
silent
interrogation
could
help
comin
to
you
she
began
gazing
at
him
fixedly
know
you
ca
do
anything
but
i
had
to
speak
to
somebody
an
i
know
nobody
better
than
you
it
about
clara
about
her
left
tubbs
they
had
words
about
last
night
an
clara
went
off
at
once
tubbs
thought
she
come
but
this
mornin
her
box
was
sent
for
an
it
was
to
be
took
to
a
house
in
islington
an
then
tubbs
came
an
told
me
an
there
worse
than
that
sidney
she
been
goin
about
to
the
theatre
an
such
places
with
a
man
as
she
got
to
know
at
the
bar
an
tubbs
says
she
believes
it
him
has
tempted
her
away
she
spoke
the
last
sentences
in
a
low
voice
painfully
watching
their
effect
why
has
tubbs
spoken
about
this
before
sidney
asked
also
in
a
subdued
voice
but
without
other
show
of
agitation
just
what
i
said
to
her
myself
the
girl
was
in
her
charge
an
it
was
her
duty
to
let
us
know
if
things
went
wrong
but
how
am
i
to
tell
her
father
i
durs
do
it
sidney
for
my
life
i
durs
i
go
an
see
her
where
she
lodging
see
i
got
the
address
wrote
down
here
but
i
should
do
more
harm
than
good
she
never
pay
any
heed
to
me
at
the
best
of
times
an
it
is
likely
she
would
now
here
if
she
made
no
attempt
to
hide
away
you
may
be
quite
sure
there
no
truth
in
what
tubbs
says
they
quarrelled
and
of
course
the
woman
makes
clara
as
black
as
she
can
tell
her
father
everything
as
soon
as
he
comes
home
you
no
choice
hewett
averted
her
face
in
profound
dejection
sidney
learnt
at
length
what
her
desire
had
been
in
coming
to
him
she
hoped
he
would
see
clara
and
persuade
her
to
return
home
durs
tell
her
father
she
kept
repeating
perhaps
it
true
what
tubbs
says
do
go
an
speak
to
her
before
it
too
late
say
we
wo
ask
her
to
come
if
only
she
let
us
know
what
she
goin
to
do
in
the
end
he
promised
to
perform
this
service
and
to
communicate
the
result
that
evening
it
was
saturday
at
one
he
left
the
workroom
hastened
home
to
prepare
himself
for
the
visit
and
without
thinking
of
dinner
set
out
to
find
the
address
hewett
had
given
him
his
steps
were
directed
to
a
dull
street
on
the
north
of
pentonville
road
the
house
at
which
he
mad
e
inquiry
was
occupied
by
a
miss
hewett
he
learnt
was
not
at
home
she
had
gone
forth
two
hours
ago
and
nothing
was
known
of
her
movements
sidney
turned
away
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
shadowed
side
of
the
street
there
was
no
breath
of
air
stirring
and
from
the
open
windows
radiated
stuffy
odours
a
quarter
of
an
hour
sufficed
to
exasperate
him
with
anxiety
and
physical
malaise
he
suffered
from
his
inability
to
do
anything
at
once
from
conflict
with
himself
as
to
whether
or
not
it
behoved
him
to
speak
with
john
hewett
of
clara
he
thought
with
anger
rather
than
fear
for
her
behaviour
seemed
to
prove
that
nothing
had
happened
save
the
inevitable
breach
with
tubbs
just
as
he
had
said
to
himself
that
it
was
no
use
waiting
about
all
the
afternoon
he
saw
clara
approaching
at
sight
of
him
she
manifested
neither
surprise
nor
annoyance
but
came
forward
with
eyes
carelessly
averted
not
having
seen
her
for
so
long
sidney
was
startled
by
the
change
in
her
features
her
cheeks
had
sunk
her
eyes
were
unnaturally
dark
there
was
something
worse
than
the
familiar
about
her
lips
been
waiting
to
see
you
he
said
you
walk
along
here
for
a
minute
or
two
do
you
want
to
say
i
tired
tubbs
has
told
your
mother
what
has
happened
and
she
came
to
me
your
father
does
know
yet
nothing
to
me
whether
he
knows
or
not
i
left
the
place
that
all
and
i
going
to
live
here
till
i
got
another
not
go
home
i
do
choose
to
i
do
see
that
it
concerns
you
mr
kirkwood
their
eyes
met
and
sidney
felt
how
little
fitted
he
was
to
reason
with
the
girl
even
would
she
consent
to
hear
him
his
mood
was
the
wrong
one
the
torrid
sunshine
seemed
to
kindle
an
evil
fire
in
him
and
with
difficulty
he
kept
back
words
of
angry
unreason
he
even
strangest
of
inconsistencies
experienced
a
kind
of
brutal
pleasure
in
her
obvious
misery
already
she
was
reaping
the
fruit
of
obstinate
folly
clara
read
what
his
eyes
expressed
she
trembled
with
responsive
hostility
it
does
concern
me
sidney
replied
half
turning
away
it
perhaps
as
well
you
should
know
that
tubbs
is
doing
her
best
to
take
away
your
good
name
however
little
we
are
to
each
other
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
and
put
you
on
your
guard
i
hope
your
father
may
hear
these
stories
before
you
have
spoken
to
him
yourself
clara
listened
with
a
contemptuous
smile
has
she
been
saying
sha
repeat
it
as
he
gazed
at
her
the
haggardness
of
her
countenance
smote
like
a
through
all
the
black
humours
about
his
heart
piercing
the
very
core
of
love
and
pity
he
spoke
in
a
voice
of
passionate
appeal
come
home
before
it
is
too
late
come
with
me
now
come
at
once
thank
heaven
you
have
got
out
of
that
place
come
home
and
stay
there
quietly
till
we
can
find
you
something
better
die
rather
than
go
home
was
her
answer
flung
at
him
as
if
in
hatred
my
father
that
and
tell
him
anything
else
you
like
i
want
no
one
to
take
any
thought
for
me
and
i
would
do
as
wish
not
to
save
my
soul
how
often
in
passing
along
the
streets
one
catches
a
few
phrases
of
discord
such
as
this
the
poor
can
seldom
command
privacy
their
scenes
alike
of
tenderness
and
of
anger
must
for
the
most
part
be
enacted
on
the
peopled
ways
it
is
one
of
their
misfortunes
one
of
the
many
necessities
which
blunt
feeling
which
balk
reconciliation
which
enhance
the
risks
of
dialogue
at
best
clara
having
uttered
the
rancour
which
had
so
long
poisoned
her
mind
straightway
crossed
the
street
and
entered
the
house
where
she
was
lodging
she
had
just
returned
from
making
several
applications
for
employment
futile
as
so
many
were
likely
to
be
if
she
persevered
in
her
search
for
a
better
place
than
the
last
the
wages
due
to
her
for
the
present
week
she
had
of
course
sacrificed
her
purchases
of
clothing
essential
and
superfluous
had
left
only
a
small
sum
out
of
her
earnings
food
fortunately
would
cost
her
little
the
difficulty
indeed
was
to
eat
anything
at
all
she
was
exhausted
after
her
long
walk
and
the
scene
with
sidney
had
made
her
tremulous
in
thrusting
open
the
windows
as
soon
as
she
entered
she
broke
a
pane
which
was
already
cracked
the
glass
cut
into
her
palm
and
blood
streamed
forth
for
a
moment
she
watched
the
red
drops
falling
to
the
floor
then
began
to
sob
miserably
almost
as
a
child
might
have
done
the
exertion
necessary
for
binding
the
wound
seemed
beyond
her
strength
sobbing
and
moaning
she
stood
in
the
same
attitude
until
the
blood
began
to
congeal
the
tears
too
she
let
dry
unneeded
upon
her
eyelashes
and
her
cheeks
the
mist
with
which
for
a
time
they
obscured
her
vision
was
nothing
amid
that
cloud
of
misery
which
blackened
about
her
spirit
as
she
brooded
the
access
of
was
followed
as
always
by
a
persistent
sense
of
intolerable
wrong
and
that
again
by
a
fierce
desire
to
plunge
herself
into
ruin
as
though
by
such
act
she
could
satiate
her
instincts
of
defiance
it
is
a
phase
of
exasperated
egotism
common
enough
in
original
natures
frustrated
by
circumstance
never
so
pronounced
as
in
those
who
suffer
from
the
social
disease
such
mood
perverts
everything
to
cause
of
bitterness
the
very
force
of
sincerity
which
clara
could
not
but
recognise
in
kirkwood
appeal
inflamed
the
resentment
she
nourished
against
him
she
felt
that
to
yield
would
be
salvation
and
happiness
yet
yield
she
might
not
and
upon
him
she
visited
the
anger
due
to
the
evil
impulses
in
her
own
heart
he
spoke
of
her
father
and
in
so
doing
struck
the
only
nerve
in
her
which
conveyed
an
emotion
of
tenderness
instantly
the
feeling
begot
and
of
was
born
as
quickly
the
harsh
with
which
her
pride
ever
answered
blame
she
had
made
her
father
life
even
more
unhappy
than
it
need
have
been
and
to
be
reminded
of
that
only
drove
her
more
resolutely
upon
the
recklessness
which
would
complete
her
ingratitude
the
afternoon
wore
away
the
evening
a
great
part
of
the
night
she
ate
a
few
mouthfuls
of
bread
but
could
not
exert
herself
to
make
tea
it
would
be
necessary
to
light
a
fire
and
already
the
air
of
the
room
was
stifling
after
a
night
of
sleeplessness
she
could
only
lie
on
her
bed
through
the
sunday
morning
wretched
in
a
sense
of
abandonment
and
then
began
to
assail
her
that
last
and
subtlest
of
temptations
the
thought
that
already
she
had
taken
an
irrevocable
step
that
an
endeavour
to
return
would
only
be
trouble
spent
in
vain
that
the
easy
course
was
in
truth
the
only
one
now
open
to
her
tubbs
was
busy
circulating
calumnies
that
they
were
nothing
more
than
calumnies
could
never
be
proved
all
who
heard
them
would
readily
enough
believe
why
should
she
struggle
uselessly
to
justify
herself
in
the
eyes
of
people
predisposed
to
condemn
her
fate
was
busy
in
all
that
had
happened
during
the
last
two
days
why
had
she
quitted
her
situation
at
a
moment
notice
why
on
this
occasion
rather
than
fifty
times
previously
it
was
not
her
own
doing
something
impelled
her
and
the
same
force
call
it
chance
or
destiny
would
direct
the
issue
once
more
all
she
could
foresee
was
the
keeping
of
her
appointment
with
scawthorne
morning
what
use
to
try
and
look
further
when
assuredly
a
succession
of
circumstances
impossible
to
calculate
would
in
the
end
constrain
her
the
best
would
be
if
she
could
sleep
out
the
interval
at
she
rose
ate
and
drank
mechanically
then
contemplated
the
hours
that
must
somehow
be
killed
there
was
sunlight
in
the
sky
but
to
what
purpose
should
she
go
out
she
went
to
the
window
and
surveyed
the
portion
of
street
that
was
visible
on
the
opposite
pavement
at
a
little
distance
a
man
was
standing
it
was
sidney
kirkwood
the
sight
of
him
roused
her
from
apathy
her
blood
tingled
rushed
into
her
cheeks
and
throbbed
at
her
temples
so
for
all
she
had
said
he
was
daring
to
act
the
spy
he
suspected
her
he
was
lurking
to
surprise
visitors
to
watch
her
outgoing
and
coming
in
very
well
at
least
he
had
provided
her
with
occupation
five
minutes
later
she
saw
that
he
had
gone
away
thereupon
having
in
the
meantime
clad
herself
she
left
the
house
and
walked
at
a
quick
step
towards
a
region
of
north
london
with
which
she
had
no
acquaintance
in
an
hour
time
she
had
found
another
lodging
which
she
took
by
the
day
only
then
back
again
to
islington
she
told
her
landlady
that
a
sudden
necessity
compelled
her
to
leave
she
would
have
a
cab
and
remove
her
box
at
once
there
was
the
hazard
that
sidney
might
return
just
as
she
was
leaving
she
braved
it
and
in
another
ten
minutes
was
out
of
reach
let
his
be
the
blame
she
had
warned
him
and
he
chose
to
disregard
her
wish
now
she
had
cut
the
last
bond
that
fretted
her
and
the
hours
rushed
on
like
a
driving
her
whither
they
would
her
mind
was
relieved
from
the
stress
of
conflict
despair
had
given
place
to
something
that
made
her
laugh
at
all
the
old
scruples
so
far
from
dreading
the
judgments
that
would
follow
her
disappearance
she
felt
a
pride
in
evil
repute
let
them
talk
of
her
if
she
dared
everything
it
would
be
well
understood
that
she
had
not
done
so
without
a
prospect
worthy
of
herself
if
she
broke
away
from
the
obligations
of
a
life
that
could
never
be
other
than
poor
and
commonplace
those
who
knew
her
would
estimate
the
compensation
she
had
found
sidney
kirkwood
was
aware
of
her
ambitions
for
his
own
sake
he
had
hoped
to
keep
her
on
the
low
level
to
which
she
was
born
now
let
him
recognise
his
folly
some
day
she
would
present
herself
before
him
sorry
that
i
could
not
oblige
you
my
dear
sir
but
you
see
that
my
lot
was
to
be
rather
different
from
that
you
kindly
planned
for
me
let
them
gossip
and
envy
it
was
a
strange
night
that
followed
between
one
and
two
the
heavens
began
to
be
overflashed
with
summer
lightning
there
was
no
thunder
no
rain
the
blue
gleams
kept
illuminating
the
room
for
more
than
an
hour
clara
could
not
lie
in
bed
the
activity
of
her
brain
became
all
but
delirium
along
her
nerves
through
all
the
courses
of
her
blood
seemed
to
run
fires
which
excited
her
with
an
indescribable
mingling
of
delight
and
torment
she
walked
to
and
fro
often
speaking
aloud
throwing
up
her
arms
she
leaned
from
the
open
window
and
let
the
lightning
play
freely
upon
her
face
she
fancied
it
had
the
effect
of
restoring
her
wasted
health
whatever
the
cause
she
felt
stronger
and
more
free
from
pain
than
for
many
months
at
dawn
she
slept
the
striking
of
a
woke
her
at
nine
giving
her
just
time
to
dress
with
care
and
set
forth
to
keep
her
appointment
chapter
xi
a
disappointment
on
ordinary
sundays
the
byasses
breakfasted
at
ten
this
morning
the
meal
was
ready
at
eight
and
bessie
boisterous
spirits
declared
the
exception
to
be
of
joyous
significance
finding
that
samuel
repeated
promises
to
rise
were
the
merest
evasion
she
rushed
into
the
room
where
he
lay
dragged
the
pillows
from
under
his
tousled
head
and
so
belaboured
him
in
schoolboy
fashion
that
he
had
no
choice
but
to
leap
towards
his
garments
in
five
minutes
he
roared
down
the
for
and
in
five
minutes
more
was
seated
in
his
consuming
fried
bacon
with
prodigious
appetite
bessie
had
the
twofold
occupation
of
waiting
upon
him
and
finishing
the
toilet
of
the
baby
she
talked
incessantly
and
laughed
with
an
echoing
shrillness
which
would
have
given
a
headache
for
the
rest
of
the
day
to
any
one
of
average
nervous
sensibility
they
were
going
to
visit
samuel
parents
who
lived
at
greenwich
bessie
had
not
yet
enjoyed
an
opportunity
of
exhibiting
her
to
the
worthy
couple
she
had
however
written
many
and
long
letters
on
the
engrossing
subject
and
was
just
a
little
fluttered
with
natural
anxiety
lest
the
infant
appearance
or
demeanour
should
disappoint
the
expectations
she
had
excited
samuel
found
his
delight
in
foretelling
the
direst
calamities
say
i
did
advise
you
to
draw
it
mild
he
remarked
whilst
breakfasting
when
bessie
had
for
the
tenth
time
obliged
him
to
look
round
and
give
his
opinion
on
points
of
costume
it
was
only
last
week
you
told
them
that
the
imp
had
never
cried
since
the
day
of
his
birth
and
i
bet
you
three
to
a
bad
halfpenny
he
roars
all
through
your
tongue
sam
or
i
throw
something
at
you
samuel
had
just
appeased
his
morning
hunger
and
was
declaring
that
the
day
promised
to
be
the
hottest
of
the
year
such
a
day
as
would
bring
out
every
vice
inherent
in
babies
when
a
very
light
tap
at
the
door
caused
bessie
to
abandon
her
intention
of
pulling
his
ears
jane
she
said
in
the
jane
who
presented
herself
was
so
strangely
unlike
her
namesake
who
lay
ill
at
peckover
four
months
ago
that
one
who
had
not
seen
her
in
the
interval
would
with
difficulty
have
recognised
her
to
begin
with
she
had
grown
a
little
only
a
little
but
enough
to
give
her
the
appearance
of
her
full
thirteen
years
then
her
hair
no
longer
straggled
in
neglect
but
was
brushed
very
smoothly
back
from
her
forehead
and
behind
was
plaited
in
a
coil
of
perfect
neatness
one
could
see
now
that
it
was
soft
fine
hair
such
as
would
tempt
the
fingers
to
the
lightest
caress
no
longer
were
her
limbs
huddled
over
with
a
few
shapeless
rags
she
wore
a
dress
of
quiet
grey
which
suited
well
with
her
hair
and
the
pale
tones
of
her
complexion
as
for
her
face
oh
yes
it
was
still
the
good
simple
unremarkable
countenance
with
the
delicate
arched
eyebrows
with
the
diffident
lips
with
the
cheeks
of
exquisite
smoothness
but
so
sadly
thin
here
too
however
a
noteworthy
change
was
beginning
to
declare
itself
you
were
no
longer
distressed
by
the
shrinking
fear
which
used
to
be
her
constant
expression
her
eyes
no
longer
reminded
you
of
a
poor
animal
that
has
been
beaten
from
every
place
where
it
sought
rest
and
no
longer
expects
anything
but
a
kick
and
a
curse
timid
they
were
drooping
after
each
brief
glance
the
eyes
of
one
who
has
suffered
and
can
not
but
often
brood
over
wretched
memories
who
does
not
venture
to
look
far
forward
lest
some
danger
may
loom
inevitable
meet
them
for
an
instant
however
and
you
saw
that
lustre
was
reviving
in
their
still
depths
that
a
woman
soul
had
begun
to
manifest
itself
under
the
shadow
of
those
gently
falling
lids
a
kind
word
and
with
what
purity
of
silent
gratitude
the
grey
pupils
responded
a
merry
word
and
mark
if
the
light
does
not
glisten
on
them
if
the
diffident
lips
do
not
form
a
smile
which
you
would
not
have
more
decided
lest
something
of
its
sweetness
should
be
sacrificed
come
and
tell
me
what
you
think
about
baby
cried
bessie

any
attention

my

samuel
facetiously

the
passage

two

trouble
to
come

till
daylight

see
whether

kirkwood
says

grandfather
thought
that

then

and
you
be

fastened

more

samuel

tongue

the
man
if
he
has
got
a
great
piece
of
bread
sticking
in
his
whiskers
how
it
get
there
off
you
go
jane
followed
them
and
stood
at
the
front
door
for
a
moment
watching
them
as
they
departed
then
she
went
upstairs
on
the
first
floor
the
doors
of
the
two
rooms
stood
open
and
the
rooms
were
bare
the
lodgers
who
had
occupied
this
part
of
the
house
had
recently
left
a
card
was
again
hanging
in
the
window
of
bessie
parlour
jane
passed
up
the
succeeding
flight
and
entered
the
chamber
which
looked
out
upon
hanover
street
the
on
which
her
grandfather
slept
had
been
arranged
for
the
day
some
two
hours
ago
snowdon
rose
at
six
and
everything
was
orderly
in
the
room
when
jane
came
to
prepare
breakfast
an
hour
later
at
present
the
old
man
was
sitting
by
the
open
window
smoking
a
pipe
he
spoke
a
few
words
with
reference
to
the
byasses
then
seemed
to
resume
a
train
of
thought
and
for
a
long
time
there
was
unbroken
silence
jane
seated
herself
at
a
table
on
which
were
a
few
books
and
writing
materials
she
began
to
copy
something
using
the
pen
with
difficulty
and
taking
extreme
pains
occasionally
her
eyes
wandered
and
once
they
rested
upon
her
grandfather
face
for
several
minutes
but
for
the
cry
of
a
milkman
or
a
in
the
street
no
sound
broke
the
quietness
of
the
summer
morning
the
blessed
sunshine
so
rarely
shed
from
a
london
sky
sunshine
the
source
of
all
solace
to
mind
and
body
reigned
gloriously
in
heaven
and
on
earth
when
more
than
an
hour
had
passed
snowdon
came
and
sat
down
beside
the
girl
without
speaking
she
showed
him
what
she
had
written
he
nodded
approvingly
i
say
it
to
you
grandfather
jane
collected
her
thoughts
then
began
to
repeat
the
parable
of
the
samaritan
from
the
first
words
it
was
evident
that
she
frequently
thus
delivered
passages
committed
to
memory
evident
too
that
instruction
and
a
natural
good
sense
guarded
her
against
the
gabbling
method
of
recitation
when
she
had
finished
snowdon
spoke
with
her
for
awhile
on
the
subject
of
the
story
in
all
he
said
there
was
the
earnestness
of
deep
personal
feeling
his
theme
was
the
virtue
of
compassion
he
appeared
to
rate
it
above
all
other
forms
of
moral
goodness
to
regard
it
as
the
saving
principle
of
human
life
only
we
had
pity
on
one
another
all
the
worst
things
we
suffer
from
in
this
world
would
be
at
an
end
it
because
men
hearts
are
hard
that
life
is
so
full
of
misery
if
we
could
only
learn
to
be
kind
and
gentle
and
forgiving
never
mind
anything
else
we
act
as
if
we
were
all
each
other
enemies
we
ca
be
merciful
because
we
expect
no
mercy
we
struggle
to
get
as
much
as
we
can
for
ourselves
and
care
nothing
for
others
think
about
it
never
let
it
go
out
of
your
mind
perhaps
some
day
it
help
you
in
your
own
life
then
there
was
silence
again
snowdon
went
back
to
his
seat
by
the
window
and
relit
his
pipe
to
muse
in
the
sunshine
seemed
sufficient
occupation
for
him
jane
opened
another
book
and
read
to
herself
in
the
afternoon
they
went
out
together
the
old
man
had
grown
more
talkative
he
passed
cheerfully
from
subject
to
subject
now
telling
a
story
of
his
experiences
abroad
now
reviving
recollections
of
london
as
he
had
known
it
sixty
years
ago
jane
listened
with
quiet
interest
she
did
not
say
much
herself
and
when
she
did
speak
it
was
with
a
noticeable
effort
to
overcome
her
habit
of
diffidence
she
was
happy
but
her
nature
had
yet
to
develop
itself
under
these
strangely
novel
conditions
a
little
before
sunset
there
came
a
knocking
at
the
jane
went
down
to
open
and
found
that
the
visitor
was
sidney
kirkwood
the
joyful
look
with
which
she
recognised
him
changed
almost
in
the
same
moment
his
face
wore
an
expression
that
alarmed
her
it
was
stern
in
trouble
and
his
smile
could
not
disguise
the
truth
without
speaking
he
walked
upstairs
and
entered
snowdon
room
to
sidney
there
was
always
something
peculiarly
impressive
in
the
first
view
of
this
quiet
chamber
simple
as
were
its
appointments
it
produced
a
sense
of
remoteness
from
the
common
conditions
of
life
invariably
he
subdued
his
voice
when
conversing
here
a
few
flowers
such
as
can
be
bought
in
the
street
generally
diffused
a
slight
scent
through
the
air
making
another
peculiarity
which
had
its
effect
on
sidney
imagination
when
jane
moved
about
it
was
with
a
soundless
step
if
she
placed
a
chair
or
arranged
things
on
the
table
it
was
as
if
with
careful
avoidance
of
the
least
noise
when
his
thoughts
turned
hitherwards
sidney
always
pictured
the
old
man
sitting
in
his
familiar
mood
of
reverie
and
jane
in
like
silence
bending
over
a
book
at
the
table
peace
the
thing
most
difficult
to
find
in
the
world
that
sidney
knew
had
here
made
itself
a
dwelling
he
shook
hands
with
snowdon
and
seated
himself
a
few
friendly
words
were
spoken
and
the
old
man
referred
to
an
excursion
they
had
agreed
to
make
together
on
the
morrow
the
general
holiday
very
sorry
replied
kirkwood
it
be
impossible
for
me
to
go
jane
was
standing
near
him
her
countenance
fell
expressing
uttermost
disappointment
has
happened
pursued
sidney
wo
let
me
go
away
even
for
a
few
hours
i
do
mean
to
say
that
it
would
really
prevent
me
but
i
should
be
so
uneasy
in
my
mind
all
the
time
that
i
enjoy
myself
and
i
should
only
spoil
your
pleasure
of
course
go
just
the
same
snowdon
reassured
him
on
this
point
jane
had
just
been
about
to
lay
supper
she
continued
her
task
and
sidney
made
a
show
of
sharing
the
meal
soon
after
as
if
conscious
that
sidney
would
speak
with
more
freedom
of
his
trouble
but
for
her
presence
jane
bade
them
and
went
to
her
own
room
there
ensued
a
break
in
the
conversation
then
kirkwood
said
with
the
abruptness
of
one
who
is
broaching
a
difficult
subject
should
like
to
tell
you
what
it
is
that
going
wrong
with
me
i
do
think
anyone
advice
would
be
the
least
good
but
it
a
miserable
affair
and
i
shall
feel
better
for
speaking
about
it
snowdon
regarded
him
with
eyes
of
calm
sympathy
there
is
a
look
of
helpful
attention
peculiar
to
the
faces
of
some
who
have
known
much
suffering
in
this
instance
the
grave
force
of
character
which
at
all
times
made
the
countenance
impressive
heightened
the
effect
of
its
gentleness
in
external
matters
the
two
men
knew
little
more
of
each
other
now
than
after
their
first
meeting
but
the
spiritual
alliance
between
them
had
strengthened
with
every
conversation
each
understood
the
other
outlook
upon
problems
of
life
which
are
not
commonly
discussed
in
the
top
rooms
of
they
felt
and
thought
differently
at
times
but
in
essentials
they
were
at
one
and
it
was
the
first
time
that
either
had
found
such
fruitful
companionship
you
hear
anything
from
the
peckovers
of
clara
hewett
sidney
began
by
asking
from
them
jane
has
often
spoken
of
her
sidney
again
hesitated
then
from
a
fragmentary
beginning
passed
into
a
detailed
account
of
his
relations
with
clara
the
girl
herself
had
she
overheard
him
could
not
have
found
fault
with
the
way
in
which
the
story
was
narrated
he
represented
his
love
as
from
the
first
without
response
which
could
give
him
serious
hope
her
faults
he
dealt
with
not
as
characteristics
to
be
condemned
but
as
evidences
of
suffering
the
outcome
of
cruel
conditions
her
engagement
at
the
he
spoke
of
as
a
detestable
slavery
which
had
wasted
her
health
and
driven
her
in
the
end
to
an
act
of
desperation
what
now
could
be
done
to
aid
her
john
hewett
was
still
in
ignorance
of
the
step
she
had
taken
and
sidney
described
himself
as
distracted
by
conflict
between
what
he
felt
to
be
his
duty
and
fear
of
what
might
happen
if
he
invoked
hewett
authority
at
intervals
through
the
day
he
had
been
going
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
street
where
clara
had
her
lodging
he
did
not
think
she
would
seek
to
escape
from
her
friends
altogether
but
her
character
and
circumstances
made
it
perilous
for
her
to
live
thus
alone
does
she
really
wish
for
inquired
snowdon
when
there
had
been
a
short
silence
does
know
poor
girl
everything
in
the
life
she
has
been
living
is
hateful
to
her
everything
since
she
left
school
she
rest
in
the
position
to
which
she
was
born
she
aims
at
an
impossible
change
of
circumstances
it
comes
from
her
father
she
ca
help
rebelling
against
what
seem
to
her
unjust
restraints
but
what
to
come
of
it
she
may
perhaps
get
a
place
in
a
large
restaurant
and
what
does
that
mean
he
broke
off
but
in
a
moment
resumed
even
more
passionately
a
vile
cursed
world
this
is
where
you
may
see
men
and
women
perish
before
your
eyes
and
no
more
chance
of
saving
them
than
if
they
were
going
down
in
she
only
a
child
only
just
seventeen
and
already
she
gone
through
a
lifetime
of
miseries
and
i
like
a
fool
i
often
been
angry
with
her
i
was
angry
yesterday
how
can
she
help
her
nature
how
can
we
any
of
us
help
what
driven
to
in
a
world
like
this
clara
is
made
to
be
one
of
those
who
slave
to
keep
themselves
alive
just
a
chance
of
birth
suppose
been
the
daughter
of
a
rich
man
then
everything
we
now
call
a
fault
in
her
would
either
have
been
of
no
account
or
actually
a
virtue
just
because
we
have
money
we
may
go
to
perdition
and
comfortable
people
tell
us
we
only
ourselves
to
blame
put
in
our
place
snowdon
face
had
gone
through
various
changes
as
sidney
flung
out
his
vehement
words
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
tone
of
some
severity
she
no
natural
affection
for
her
father
does
she
care
nothing
for
what
trouble
she
brings
him
sidney
did
not
reply
at
once
as
he
was
about
to
speak
snowdon
bent
forward
suddenly
and
touched
his
arm
me
see
her
let
me
send
jane
to
her
morning
and
ask
her
to
come
here
i
might
i
ca
say
but
i
might
do
some
good
to
this
sidney
gave
willing
assent
but
without
sanguine
expectation
in
further
talk
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
if
this
step
had
no
result
john
hewett
ought
to
be
immediately
informed
of
the
state
of
things
this
was
at
ten
on
sunday
evening
so
do
we
play
our
in
the
eye
of
fate
the
mention
of
jane
led
to
a
brief
conversation
regarding
her
before
sidney
took
his
leave
since
her
recovery
she
had
been
going
regularly
to
school
to
make
up
for
the
time
of
which
she
had
been
defrauded
by
peckover
her
proposal
was
that
she
should
continue
thus
for
another
six
months
after
which
he
said
it
would
be
time
for
her
to
learn
a
business
byass
had
suggested
the
choice
of
making
to
which
she
herself
had
been
brought
up
possibly
that
would
do
as
well
as
anything
else
suppose
so
was
sidney
reluctant
acquiescence
as
ill
as
anything
else
would
be
a
better
way
to
put
it
snowdon
regarded
him
with
unusual
fixedness
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
making
some
significant
remark
but
immediately
his
face
expressed
change
of
purpose
and
he
said
without
emphasis
must
be
able
to
earn
her
own
living
sidney
before
going
home
walked
round
to
the
street
in
which
he
had
already
lingered
several
times
and
where
yesterday
he
had
spoken
with
clara
the
windows
of
the
house
he
gazed
at
were
dark
chapter

saturnalia
so
at
length
came
monday
the
first
monday
in
august
a
day
gravely
set
apart
for
the
repose
and
recreation
of
multitudes
who
neither
know
how
to
rest
nor
how
to
refresh
themselves
with
pastime
will
the

don

it

does
the
awaking

look
forth
upon
the

and
address
his
adorations
to

throw
wide
the
doors
of

temple

behold
we
come
in
our
thousands
jingling
the
coins
that
shall
purchase
us
this
one
day
of
tragical
mirth
before
us
is
the
dark
and

it
is
a
far
cry
to
the

joys

io
saturnalia
for
certain
friends
of
ours
this
morning
brought
an
event
of
importance
at
a
church
in
clerkenwell
were
joined
together
in
holy
matrimony
robert
hewett
and
penelope
otherwise
pennyloaf
candy
the
former
aged
nineteen
the
latter
less
than
that
by
nearly
three
years
john
hewett
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
an
alliance
so
disreputable
hewett
had
in
vain
besought
her
stepson
not
to
marry
so
unworthily
even
as
a
young
man
of
good
birth
has
been
known
to
enjoy
a
subtle
in
the
thought
that
he
graciously
bestows
his
name
upon
a
maiden
who
to
all
intents
and
purposes
may
be
said
never
to
have
been
born
at
all
so
did
bob
hewett
feel
when
he
put
a
ring
upon
the
scrubby
finger
of
pennyloaf
proudly
conscious
was
bob
that
he
a
beneath
him
conscious
also
that
clem
peckover
was
gnawing
her
lips
in
rage
candy
was
still
sober
at
the
hour
of
the
ceremony
her
husband
not
a
bad
fellow
in
his
way
had
long
since
returned
to
her
and
as
yet
had
not
done
more
than
threaten
a
repetition
of
his
assault
both
were
present
at
church
a
week
ago
bob
had
established
himself
in
a
room
in
shooter
gardens
henceforth
to
be
shared
with
him
by
his
bride
probably
he
might
have
discovered
a
more
inviting
abode
for
the
early
days
of
married
life
but
bob
had
something
of
the
artist
temperament
and
could
not
trouble
about
practical
details
for
the
present
this
room
would
do
as
well
as
another
it
was
cheap
and
he
had
need
of
all
the
money
he
could
save
from
everyday
expenses
pennyloaf
would
go
en
with
her
of
course
and
all
they
wanted
was
a
roof
over
their
heads
at
night
and
in
truth
he
was
fond
of
pennyloaf
the
poor
little
slave
worshipped
him
so
sincerely
she
repaid
his
affectionate
words
with
such
fervent
gratitude
and
there
was
no
denying
that
she
had
rather
a
pretty
face
which
had
attracted
him
from
the
first
but
above
all
this
preference
accorded
to
so
humble
a
rival
had
set
clem
peckover
beside
herself
it
was
all
very
well
for
clem
to
make
pretence
of
having
transferred
her
affections
to
jack
bartley
why
suke
jollop
ostensibly
clem
bosom
friend
but
treacherous
at
times
because
she
had
herself
given
an
eye
to
jack
suke
jollop
reported
that
clem
would
have
killed
pennyloaf
had
she
dared
pennyloaf
had
been
going
about
in
fear
for
her
life
since
that
attack
upon
her
in
myddelton
passage
durs
marry
you
bob
i
durs
she
kept
saying
when
the
proposal
was
first
made
but
bob
laughed
with
contemptuous
defiance
he
carried
his
point
and
now
he
was
going
to
spend
his
at
the
crystal
palace
choosing
that
resort
because
he
knew
clem
would
be
there
and
jack
bartley
and
suke
jollop
and
many
another
acquaintance
before
whom
he
was
resolved
to
make
display
of
magnanimity
pennyloaf
shone
in
most
unwonted
apparel
everything
was
new
except
her
boots
it
had
been
decided
that
these
only
needed
soleing
her
hat
of
yellow
straw
was
graced
with
the
reddest
feather
purchasable
in
the
city
road
she
had
a
dolman
of
most
fashionable
cut
blue
lustrous
blue
likewise
was
her
dress
hung
about
with
bows
and
streamers
and
the
gleaming
ring
on
the
scrubby
small
finger
on
that
hand
most
assuredly
pennyloaf
would
wear
no
glove
how
proud
she
was
of
her
ring
how
she
turned
it
round
and
round
when
nobody
was
looking
gold
pennyloaf
real
gold
the
pawnbroker
would
lend
her
on
it
any
time
at
holborn
viaduct
there
was
a
perpetual
rush
of
people
for
the
trains
to
the
as
soon
as
a
train
was
full
off
it
went
and
another
long
string
of
empty
carriages
drew
up
in
its
place
no
distinction
between
get
in
where
you
like
where
you
can
positively
pennyloaf
found
herself
seated
in
a
carriage
she
would
have
been
but
that
bob
flung
himself
back
on
the
cushions
with
such
an
easy
air
and
nodded
laughingly
at
her
among
their
companions
was
a
youth
with
a
concertina
as
soon
as
the
train
moved
he
burst
into
melody
it
was
the
natural
invitation
to
song
and
all
joined
in
the
latest
ditties
learnt
at
the
away
they
sped
over
the
roofs
of
south
london
about
them
the
universal
glare
of
sunlight
the
carriage
dense
with
he
for
the
bottle
of
muddy
ale
passed
round
in
genial
fellowship
from
mouth
to
mouth
pennyloaf
would
not
drink
of
it
she
had
a
dread
of
all
such
bottles
in
her
heart
she
rejoiced
that
bob
knew
no
craving
for
strong
liquor
towards
the
end
of
the
journey
the
young
man
with
the
concertina
passed
round
his
hat
clem
peckover
had
come
by
the
same
train
she
was
one
of
a
large
party
which
had
followed
close
behind
bob
and
pennyloaf
to
the
railway
station
now
they
followed
along
the
long
corridors
into
the
with
many
a
loud
expression
of
mockery
with
laughter
with
coarse
jokes
depend
upon
it
clem
was
gorgeously
arrayed
amid
her
satellites
she
swept
on
a
stately
ship
of
tarsus
bound
for
the
isles
of
javan
or
gadire
her
face
was
aflame
her
eyes
flashed
in
enjoyment
of
the
uproar
jack
bartley
wore
a
high
hat
bob
never
had
owned
one
in
his
life
and
about
his
neck
was
a
tie
of
crimson
yellow
was
his
waistcoat
even
such
a
waistcoat
as
you
may
see
in
pall
mall
and
his
had
a
nigger
head
for
handle
he
was
the
oracle
of
the
maidens
around
him
every
moment
the
appeal
was
to
jeck
suke
jollop
who
would
in
reality
have
preferred
to
accompany
bob
and
his
allies
whispered
it
about
that
jack
had
in
his
pocket
and
was
going
to
spend
every
penny
of
it
before
he
left
the
yes
bloomin
penny
thus
early
in
the
day
the
grounds
were
of
course
preferred
to
the
interior
of
the
glass
house
bob
and
pennyloaf
bent
their
steps
to
the
fair
here
already
was
gathered
much
goodly
company
above
their
heads
hung
a
thick
white
wavering
cloud
of
dust
and
are
from
of
old
the
chief
features
of
these
rural
festivities
they
soared
and
dipped
and
circled
to
the
joyous
music
of
organs
which
played
the
same
tune
automatically
for
any
number
of
hours
whilst
raucous
voices
invited
all
and
sundry
to
take
their
turn
should
this
delight
pall
behold
on
every
hand
such
sports
as
are
dearest
to
the
briton
those
which
call
for
strength
of
sinew
and
exactitude
of
aim
the
philosophic
mind
would
have
noted
with
interest
how
ingeniously
these
games
were
made
to
appeal
to
the
patriotism
of
the
throng
did
you
choose
to
sticks
in
the
contest
for
behold
your
object
was
a
wooden
model
of
the
treacherous
afghan
or
the
base
african
if
you
took
up
the
mallet
to
smite
upon
a
spring
and
make
proof
of
how
far
you
could
send
a
ball
flying
upwards
your
blow
descended
upon
the
head
of
some
other
recent
foeman
try
your
fist
at
the
indicator
of
muscularity
and
with
zeal
you
smote
full
in
the
stomach
of
a
guy
made
to
represent
a
russian
if
you
essayed
the
the
mark
set
you
was
on
the
flank
of
a
wooden
donkey
so
contrived
that
it
would
kick
when
hit
in
the
true
spot
what
a
joy
to
observe
the
tendency
of
all
these
diversions
how
characteristic
of
a
people
that
nowhere
could
be
found
any
amusement
appealing
to
the
mere
mind
or
calculated
to
effeminate
by
encouraging
a
love
of
beauty
bob
had
a
sovereign
to
get
rid
of
he
shied
for
he
swung
in
the
boat
with
pennyloaf
he
rode
with
her
on
the
whirligigs
when
they
were
choked
and
whitened
from
head
to
foot
with
dust
it
was
natural
to
seek
the
nearest
bob
had
some
male
and
female
acquaintances
clustered
about
him
by
now
of
course
he
must
celebrate
the
occasion
by
entertaining
all
of
them
consumed
with
thirst
he
began
to
drink
without
counting
the
glasses
pennyloaf
plucked
at
his
elbow
but
bob
was
beginning
to
feel
that
he
must
display
spirit
because
he
was
married
that
was
no
reason
for
his
relinquishing
the
claims
to
leadership
in
gallantry
which
had
always
been
recognised
hollo
here
was
suke
jollop
she
had
just
quarrelled
with
clem
and
had
been
searching
for
the
hostile
camp
a
drink
suke
cried
bob
when
he
heard
her
acrimonious
charges
against
clem
and
jack
a
pretty
girl
suke
and
with
a
hat
which
made
itself
proudly
manifest
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
drink
of
course
she
would
drink
that
thirsty
she
could
almost
drop
bob
enjoyed
this
secession
from
the
enemy
he
knew
suke
old
fondness
for
him
and
began
to
play
upon
it
elated
with
beer
and
vanity
he
no
longer
paid
the
least
attention
to
pennyloaf
remonstrances
nay
he
at
length
bade
her
her
bloomin
row
pennyloaf
had
a
tear
in
her
eye
she
looked
fiercely
at
miss
jollop
the
day
wore
on
for
utter
weariness
pennyloaf
was
constrained
to
beg
that
they
might
go
into
the
and
find
a
shadowed
seat
her
tone
revived
tenderness
in
bob
again
he
became
gracious
devoted
he
promised
that
not
another
glass
of
beer
should
pass
his
lips
and
sake
jollop
with
all
her
like
might
go
to
perdition
but
heavens
how
sweltering
it
was
under
this
glass
canopy
how
the
dust
rose
from
the
trampled
boards
come
let
have
tea
the
programme
says
there
be
a
military
band
playing
presently
and
we
shall
return
refreshed
to
hear
it
so
they
made
their
way
to
the
having
paid
at
the
entrance
they
were
admitted
to
feed
freely
on
all
that
lay
before
them
with
difficulty
could
a
seat
be
found
in
the
huge
room
the
uproar
of
voices
was
deafening
on
the
tables
lay
bread
butter
cake
in
hunches
all
things
to
whomso
could
secure
them
in
the
conflict
along
the
gangways
coursed
perspiring
waiters
heaping
up
giant
structures
of
used
plates
and
cups
distributing
clean
utensils
and
miraculously
sharp
in
securing
the
gratuity
expected
from
each
guest
as
he
rose
satiate
muscular
men
in
aprons
wheeled
hither
the
supplies
of
steaming
fluid
in
immense
cans
on
heavy
trucks
here
practical
joking
found
the
most
graceful
of
opportunities
whether
it
were
the
deft
direction
of
a
piece
of
cake
at
the
nose
of
a
person
sitting
opposite
or
the
emptying
of
a
saucer
down
your
neighbour
back
or
the
ingenious
jogging
of
an
arm
which
was
in
the
act
of
raising
a
full
now
and
then
an
fellow
whose
beer
disagreed
with
him
would
resent
some
piece
of
elegant
trifling
and
the
waiters
would
find
it
needful
to
request
gentlemen
not
to
fight
until
they
had
left
the
room
these
cases
however
were
exceptional
on
the
whole
there
reigned
a
spirit
of
imbecile
joviality
shrieks
of
female
laughter
testified
to
the
success
of
the
entertainment
as
bob
and
his
companion
quitted
this
sphere
of
delight
brought
it
to
pass
that
jack
bartley
and
his
train
were
on
the
point
of
entering
jack
uttered
a
phrase
of
stinging
sarcasm
with
reference
to
pennyloaf
red
feather
whereupon
bob
smote
him
exactly
between
the
eyes
yells
arose
there
was
a
scuffle
a
rush
a
tumult
the
two
were
separated
before
further
harm
came
of
the
little
misunderstanding
but
jack
went
to
the
vowing
vengeance
poor
pennyloaf
shed
tears
as
bob
led
her
to
the
place
where
the
band
had
begun
playing
only
her
husband
anger
prevented
her
from
yielding
to
utter
misery
but
now
they
had
come
to
the
centre
of
the
building
and
by
dint
of
much
struggle
in
the
crowd
they
obtained
a
standing
whence
they
could
see
the
vast
amphitheatre
filled
with
thousands
of
faces
here
at
length
was
quietness
intermission
of
folly
and
brutality
bob
became
another
man
as
he
stood
and
listened
he
looked
with
kindness
into
pennyloaf
pale
weary
face
and
his
arm
stole
about
her
waist
to
support
her
ha
pennyloaf
was
happy
the
last
trace
of
tears
vanished
she
too
was
sensible
of
the
influences
of
music
her
heart
throbbed
as
she
let
herself
lean
against
her
husband
well
as
every
one
must
needs
have
his
panacea
for
the
ills
of
society
let
me
inform
you
of
mine
to
humanise
the
multitude
two
things
are
necessary
two
things
of
the
simplest
kind
conceivable
in
the
first
place
you
must
effect
an
entire
change
of
economic
conditions
a
preliminary
step
of
which
every
tyro
will
recognise
the
easiness
then
you
must
bring
to
bear
on
the
new
order
of
things
the
constant
influence
of
music
does
not
the
prescription
recommend
itself
it
is
jesting
in
earnest
for
work
as
you
will
there
is
no
chance
of
a
new
and
better
world
until
the
old
be
utterly
destroyed
destroy
sweep
away
prepare
the
ground
then
shall
music
the
holy
music
the
civiliser
breathe
over
the
renewed
earth
and
with
orphean
magic
raise
in
perfected
beauty
the
towers
of
the
city
of
man
hours
yet
before
the
fireworks
begin
never
mind
here
by
good
luck
we
find
seats
where
we
can
watch
the
throng
passing
and
repassing
it
is
a
great
review
of
the
people
on
the
whole
how
respectable
they
are
how
sober
how
deadly
dull
see
how
the
poor
girls
are
becoming
how
they
gape
what
listless
eyes
most
of
them
have
the
stoop
in
the
shoulders
so
universal
among
them
merely
means
in
the
workroom
not
one
in
a
thousand
shows
the
elements
of
taste
in
dress
vulgarity
and
worse
glares
in
all
but
every
costume
observe
the
women
it
would
be
small
surprise
that
their
good
looks
had
vanished
but
whence
comes
it
they
are
animal
repulsive
absolutely
vicious
in
ugliness
mark
the
men
in
their
turn
four
in
every
six
have
visages
so
deformed
by
that
they
excite
disgust
their
hair
is
cut
down
to
within
half
an
inch
of
the
scalp
their
legs
are
twisted
out
of
shape
by
evil
conditions
of
life
from
birth
upwards
whenever
a
youth
and
a
girl
come
along
how
flagrantly
shows
the
coarseness
they
are
pretty
so
many
of
these
girls
delicate
of
feature
graceful
did
but
their
slavery
allow
them
natural
development
and
the
heart
sinks
as
one
sees
them
side
by
side
with
the
men
who
are
to
be
their
husbands
one
of
the
livelier
groups
is
surging
hitherwards
here
we
have
frolic
here
we
have
humour
the
young
man
who
leads
them
has
been
going
about
all
day
with
the
lining
of
his
hat
turned
down
over
his
forehead
for
the
thousandth
time
those
girls
are
screaming
with
laughter
at
the
sight
of
him
ha
ha
he
has
slipped
and
fallen
upon
the
floor
and
makes
an
obstruction
his
companions
treat
him
like
a
horse
that
is
in
the
street
out
for
his
cries
one
and
another
on
his
if
this
does
come
to
an
end
we
shall
die
of
laughter
lot
one
of
the
funniest
of
the
party
is
wearing
a
gigantic
cardboard
nose
and
whiskers
there
the
stumbler
is
on
his
feet
again
he
comes
up
smilin
cries
his
friend
of
the
cardboard
nose
and
we
shake
our
diaphragms
with
mirth
one
of
the
party
is
an
unusually
tall
man
are
you
comin
down
to
have
a
look
at
us
cries
a
pert
lass
as
she
skips
by
him
a
great
review
of
the
people
since
man
came
into
being
did
the
world
ever
exhibit
a
sadder
spectacle
evening
advances
the
great
ugly
building
will
presently
be
lighted
with
innumerable
lamps
away
to
the
west
yonder
the
heavens
are
afire
with
sunset
but
at
that
we
do
not
care
to
look
never
in
our
lives
did
we
regard
it
we
know
not
what
is
meant
by
beauty
or
grandeur
here
under
the
glass
roof
stand
white
forms
of
undraped
men
and
women
casts
of
antique
statues
but
we
care
as
little
for
the
glory
of
art
as
for
that
of
nature
we
have
a
vague
feeling
that
for
some
reason
or
other
antiquity
excuses
the
indecent
but
further
than
that
we
do
not
get
as
the
dusk
descends
there
is
a
general
setting
of
the
throng
towards
the
open
air
all
the
pathways
swarm
with
groups
which
have
a
tendency
to
disintegrate
into
couples
universal
is
the
protecting
arm
relief
from
the
sweltering
atmosphere
of
the
hours
of
sunshine
causes
a
revival
of
hilarity
those
who
have
hitherto
only
bemused
themselves
with
liquor
now
pass
into
the
stage
of
jovial
recklessness
and
others
determined
to
prolong
a
flagging
merriment
begin
to
depend
upon
their
companions
for
guidance
on
the
terraces
dancing
has
commenced
the
players
of
violins
concertinas
and
do
a
brisk
trade
among
the
groups
eager
for
a
valse
so
do
the
pickpockets
vigorous
and
varied
is
the
jollity
that
occupies
the
external
galleries
filling
now
in
expectation
of
the
fireworks
indescribable
the
mingled
tumult
that
roars
heavenwards
girls
linked
by
the
leap
along
with
shrieks
like
grotesque
maenads
a
rougher
horseplay
finds
favour
among
the
youths
occasionally
leading
to
fisticuffs
thick
voices
bellow
in
fragmentary
chorus
from
every
side
comes
the
yell
the
the
whistle
and
as
the
bass
the
accompaniment
sounds
tramp
tramp
along
the
wooden
flooring
a
fight
a
scene
of
bestial
drunkenness
a
tender
whispering
between
two
lovers
proceed
concurrently
in
a
space
of
five
square
above
them
glimmers
the
dawn
of
starlight
for
perhaps
the
first
time
in
his
life
bob
hewett
has
drunk
more
than
he
can
well
carry
to
pennyloaf
remonstrances
he
answers
more
and
more
impatiently
does
she
talk
like
a
bloomin
fool
one
get
married
every
day
he
is
on
the
for
jack
bartley
now
only
let
him
meet
jack
and
it
shall
be
seen
who
is
the
better
man
pennyloaf
rejoices
that
the
hostile
party
are
nowhere
discoverable
she
is
persuaded
to
join
in
a
dance
though
every
moment
it
seems
to
her
that
she
must
sink
to
the
ground
in
uttermost
exhaustion
naturally
she
does
not
dance
with
sufficient
liveliness
to
please
bob
he
seizes
another
girl
a
stranger
and
whirls
round
the
circle
with
a
laugh
of
triumph
pennyloaf
misery
is
relieved
by
the
beginning
of
the
fireworks
up
shoot
the
rockets
and
all
the
reeking
multitude
utters
a
huge
of
idiot
admiration
now
at
length
must
we
think
of
tearing
ourselves
away
from
these
delights
already
the
more
prudent
people
are
hurrying
to
the
railway
knowing
by
dire
experience
what
it
means
to
linger
until
the
last
cargoes
pennyloaf
has
hard
work
to
get
her
husband
as
far
as
the
station
bob
is
not
quite
steady
upon
his
feet
and
the
hustling
of
the
crowd
perpetually
excites
him
to
bellicose
challenges
they
reach
the
platform
somehow
they
stand
wedged
amid
a
throng
which
roars
persistently
as
a
substitute
for
the
activity
of
limb
row
become
impossible
a
train
is
drawing
up
slowly
the
danger
is
lest
people
in
the
front
row
should
be
pushed
over
the
edge
of
the
platform
but
porters
exert
themselves
with
success
a
rush
a
tumble
curses
blows
laughter
screams
of
pain
and
we
are
in
a
carriage
pennyloaf
has
to
be
dragged
up
from
under
the
seat
and
all
her
indignation
can
not
free
her
from
the
jovial
embrace
of
a
man
who
insists
that
there
is
plenty
of
room
on
his
knee
off
we
go
it
is
a
long
coach
and
already
five
or
six
musical
instruments
have
struck
up
we
smoke
and
sing
at
the
same
time
we
quarrel
and
make
love
the
latter
in
somewhat
primitive
fashion
we
roll
about
with
the
rolling
of
the
train
we
nod
into
hoggish
sleep
the
platform
at
holborn
viaduct
and
there
to
pennyloaf
terror
it
is
seen
that
clem
peckover
and
her
satellites
have
come
by
the
same
train
she
does
her
best
to
get
bob
quickly
away
but
clem
keeps
close
in
their
neighbourhood
just
as
they
issue
from
the
station
pennyloaf
feels
herself
bespattered
from
head
to
foot
with
some
kind
of
fluid
turning
she
is
aware
that
all
her
enemies
have
squirts
in
their
hands
and
are
preparing
for
a
second
discharge
of
filthy
water
anguish
for
the
ruin
of
her
dress
overcomes
all
other
fear
she
calls
upon
bob
to
defend
her
but
an
immediate
conflict
was
not
jack
bartley
intention
he
and
those
with
him
made
off
at
a
run
bob
pursuing
as
closely
as
his
unsteadiness
would
permit
in
this
way
they
all
traversed
the
short
distance
to
clerkenwell
green
either
party
echoing
the
objurgations
along
the
streets
at
length
arrived
the
suitable
moment
near
james
church
jack
bartley
made
a
stand
and
defied
his
enemy
to
come
on
bob
responded
with
furious
eagerness
amid
a
press
of
delighted
spectators
swelled
by
people
just
turned
out
of
the
the
two
lads
fought
like
wild
animals
nor
were
they
the
only
combatants
exasperated
by
the
certainty
that
her
hat
and
dolman
were
ruined
pennyloaf
flew
with
erected
nails
at
clem
peckover
it
was
just
what
the
latter
desired
in
an
instant
she
had
rent
half
pennyloaf
garments
off
her
back
and
was
tearing
her
face
till
the
blood
streamed
inconsolable
was
the
grief
of
the
crowd
when
a
couple
of
stalwart
policemen
came
hustling
forward
thrusting
to
left
and
right
irresistibly
clearing
the
corner
there
was
no
question
of
making
arrests
it
was
the
night
of
and
the
capacity
of
is
limited
enough
that
the
fight
perforce
came
to
an
end
amid
frenzied
blasphemy
bob
and
jack
went
their
several
ways
so
did
clem
and
pennyloaf
poor
pennyloaf
arrived
at
shooter
gardens
and
having
groped
her
way
blindly
up
to
the
black
hole
which
was
her
she
just
managed
to
light
a
candle
then
sank
down
upon
the
bare
floor
and
wept
you
could
not
have
recognised
her
her
pretty
face
was
all
blood
and
dirt
she
held
in
her
hand
the
fragment
of
a
hat
and
her
dolman
had
disappeared
her
husband
was
not
in
much
better
plight
his
waistcoat
and
shirt
were
rent
open
his
coat
was
and
it
seemed
likely
that
he
had
lost
the
sight
of
one
eye
sitting
there
in
drunken
lassitude
he
breathed
nothing
but
threats
of
future
vengeance
an
hour
later
noises
of
a
familiar
kind
sounded
beneath
the
window
a
woman
voice
was
raised
in
the
fury
of
mad
drunkenness
and
a
man
answered
her
with
threats
and
blows
mother
sobbed
pennyloaf
knew
she
would
get
over
she
never
did
get
over
a
candy
had
taken
the
pledge
when
her
husband
consented
to
return
and
live
with
her
unfortunately
she
did
not
at
the
same
time
transfer
herself
to
a
country
where
there
are
no
and
no
short
of
such
decisive
change
what
hope
for
her
bob
was
already
asleep
breathing
stertorously
as
for
pennyloaf
she
was
so
overwearied
that
hours
passed
before
oblivion
fell
upon
her
aching
eyelids
she
was
thinking
all
the
time
that
on
the
morrow
it
would
be
necessary
to
pawn
her
chapter
xiii
the
bringer
of
ill
news
knowing
the
likelihood
that
clara
hewett
would
go
from
home
for
sidney
made
it
his
request
before
he
left
hanover
street
on
sunday
night
that
jane
might
be
despatched
on
her
errand
at
an
early
hour
next
morning
at
eight
accordingly
snowdon
went
forth
with
his
granddaughter
and
having
discovered
the
street
to
which
sidney
had
directed
him
he
waited
at
a
distance
whilst
jane
went
to
make
her
inquiries
in
a
few
minutes
the
girl
rejoined
him
hewett
has
gone
away
she
reported
spend
the
day
do
you
mean
was
snowdon
troubled
question
she
has
left
the
house
she
went
yesterday
in
the
afternoon
it
was
very
sudden
the
landlady
says
and
she
does
know
where
gone
to
jane
had
no
understanding
of
what
her
information
implied
seeing
that
it
was
received
as
grave
news
she
stood
regarding
her
grandfather
anxiously
though
clara
had
passed
out
of
her
world
since
those
first
days
of
illness
jane
held
her
in
a
memory
which
knew
no
motive
of
retention
so
strong
as
gratitude
the
thought
of
harm
or
sorrow
coming
upon
her
protector
had
a
twofold
painfulness
instantly
she
divined
that
clara
was
in
some
way
the
cause
of
sidney
kirkwood
inability
to
go
into
the
country
for
a
long
time
the
two
had
been
closely
linked
in
her
reflections
peckover
and
clem
used
constantly
to
exchange
remarks
which
made
this
inevitable
but
not
until
now
had
jane
really
felt
the
significance
of
the
bond
of
a
sudden
she
had
a
throbbing
at
her
heart
and
a
confusion
of
mind
which
would
not
allow
her
to
pursue
the
direct
train
of
thought
naturally
provoked
by
the
visit
she
had
just
paid
a
turbid
flood
of
ideas
of
vague
surmises
of
apprehensions
of
forecasts
swept
across
her
consciousness
the
blood
forsook
her
cheeks
but
that
the
old
man
began
to
move
away
she
could
have
remained
thus
for
many
minutes
struggling
with
that
new
thing
which
was
taking
possession
of
her
life
the
disappointment
of
the
day
was
no
longer
simple
and
such
as
a
child
experiences
nor
ever
from
this
hour
onwards
would
jane
regard
things
as
she
had
been
wont
to
do
with
the
simple
feelings
of
childhood
snowdon
walked
on
in
silence
until
the
street
they
had
visited
was
far
behind
them
jane
was
accustomed
to
his
long
fits
of
musing
but
now
she
with
difficulty
refrained
from
questioning
him
he
said
at
length
i
afraid
we
shall
have
to
give
up
our
day
in
the
country
she
assented
readily
gladly
all
the
joy
had
gone
out
of
the
proposed
excursion
and
she
wished
dow
to
be
by
herself
in
quietness
think
i
let
you
go
home
alone
snowdon
continued
want
to
see
kirkwood
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
find
him
in
if
i
walk
on
at
once
they
went
in
different
directions
and
snowdon
made
what
speed
he
could
to
tysoe
street
sidney
had
already
been
out
walking
restlessly
and
aimlessly
for
two
or
three
hours
the
news
he
now
heard
was
the
fulfilment
of
a
dread
that
had
been
torturing
him
through
the
night
no
calamity
is
so
difficult
to
realise
when
it
befalls
as
one
which
has
haunted
us
in
imagination
means
nothing
he
exclaimed
as
if
resentfully
was
dissatisfied
with
the
lodging
that
all
perhaps
she
already
got
a
place
i
dare
say
there
a
note
from
her
at
home
this
morning
you
go
and
see
if
there
is
asked
snowdon
allowing
as
usual
a
moment
silence
to
intervene
sidney
hesitated
avoiding
the
other
look
shall
go
to
that
house
first
of
all
i
think
of
course
i
shall
hear
no
more
than
they
told
jane
but
he
took
a
deep
breath
go
there
said
snowdon
afterwards
go
to
the
hewetts
if
she
written
to
them
or
let
them
have
news
of
any
kind
her
father
ought
to
be
kept
in
ignorance
for
another
hour
ought
to
have
been
told
before
this
replied
sidney
ill
a
thick
ought
to
have
been
told
on
saturday
and
the
be
mine
it
is
an
experience
familiar
to
impulsive
and
men
that
a
moment
crisis
may
render
scarcely
intelligible
a
mode
of
thought
or
course
of
action
which
till
then
one
had
deemed
perfectly
rational
sidney
hopeless
in
spite
of
the
pretences
he
made
stood
aghast
at
the
responsibility
he
had
taken
upon
himself
it
was
so
obvious
to
him
now
that
he
ought
to
have
communicated
to
john
hewett
without
loss
of
time
the
news
which
hewett
brought
on
saturday
morning
but
could
he
be
sure
that
john
was
still
in
ignorance
of
clara
movements
was
it
not
all
but
certain
that
hewett
must
have
broken
the
news
before
this
if
not
there
lay
before
him
a
terrible
duty
the
two
went
forth
together
and
another
visit
was
paid
to
the
after
that
sidney
called
upon
tubbs
and
made
a
simple
inquiry
for
clara
with
the
anticipated
result
wo
find
her
in
this
part
of
london
it
my
belief
said
the
woman
significantly
left
the
lodgings
as
she
took
so
much
i
know
never
meant
to
stay
there
not
she
you
a
friend
of
her
father
mister
sidney
could
not
trust
himself
to
make
a
reply
he
rejoined
snowdon
at
a
little
distance
and
expressed
his
intention
of
going
at
once
to
clerkenwell
close
me
see
you
again
said
the
old
man
sadly
sidney
promised
and
they
took
leave
of
each
other
it
was
now
nearing
ten
in
the
close
an
organ
was
giving
delight
to
a
great
crowd
of
children
some
of
them
wearing
holiday
garb
but
most
clad
in
the
native
rags
which
served
them
for
all
seasons
and
all
days
the
volume
of
clanging
melody
fell
with
torture
upon
kirkwood
ear
and
when
he
saw
that
the
instrument
was
immediately
before
peckover
house
he
stood
aside
in
gloomy
impatience
waiting
till
it
should
move
away
this
happened
in
a
few
minutes
the
house
door
being
open
he
walked
straight
upstairs
on
the
landing
he
confronted
hewett
she
started
on
seeing
him
and
whispered
a
question
the
exchange
of
a
few
words
apprised
sidney
that
hewett
did
not
even
know
of
clara
having
quitted
tubbs
i
must
tell
him
everything
he
said
to
put
the
task
upon
the
poor
woman
would
have
been
simple
cowardice
merely
in
hearing
his
news
she
was
blanched
with
dread
she
could
only
point
to
the
door
of
the
front
room
the
only
one
rented
by
the
family
since
jane
occupation
of
the
other
had
taught
them
to
be
as
economical
in
this
respect
as
their
neighbours
were
sidney
knocked
and
entered
two
months
had
passed
since
his
latest
visit
and
he
observed
that
in
the
meantime
everything
had
become
more
squalid
the
floor
the
window
the
furniture
were
not
kept
so
clean
as
formerly
inevitable
result
of
the
overcrowding
of
a
room
the
air
was
bad
the
children
looked
untidy
the
large
bed
had
not
been
set
in
order
since
last
night
in
it
lay
the
baby
crying
as
always
ailing
as
it
had
done
from
the
day
of
its
birth
john
hewett
was
engaged
in
mending
one
of
the
chairs
of
which
the
legs
had
become
loose
he
looked
with
surprise
at
the
visitor
and
at
once
averted
his
face
sullenly
hewett
kirkwood
began
without
form
of
greeting
saturday
morning
i
heard
something
that
i
believe
i
ought
to
have
let
you
know
at
once
i
felt
though
that
it
was
hardly
my
business
and
somehow
we
have
been
quite
so
open
with
each
other
just
lately
as
we
used
to
be
his
voice
sank
hewett
had
risen
from
his
crouching
attitude
and
was
looking
him
full
in
the
face
with
eyes
which
grew
momentarily
darker
and
more
hostile
why
are
you
stopping
what
have
you
got
to
say
the
words
came
from
a
dry
throat
the
effort
to
pronounce
them
clearly
made
the
last
all
but
violent
friday
night
sidney
resumed
his
own
utterance
uncertain
left
her
place
she
took
a
room
not
far
from
upper
street
and
i
saw
her
spoke
to
her
she
quarrelled
with
tubbs
i
urged
her
to
come
home
but
she
would
listen
to
me
this
morning
i
been
to
try
and
see
her
again
but
they
tell
me
she
went
away
yesterday
afternoon
i
ca
find
where
she
living
now
hewett
took
a
step
forward
his
face
was
so
distorted
so
fierce
that
sidney
involuntarily
raised
an
arm
as
if
to
defend
himself
it
you
as
comes
tellin
me
this
john
exclaimed
a
note
of
anguish
blending
with
his
fury
have
the
face
to
stand
there
speak
like
that
to
me
when
you
know
it
all
your
own
doing
who
was
the
cause
as
the
girl
went
away
from
who
was
it
i
say
been
as
friendly
as
we
used
to
be
have
we
an
why
have
i
seen
it
plainer
an
plainer
what
you
was
thinkin
when
you
told
me
to
let
her
have
her
own
way
i
spoke
the
truth
then
i
felt
it
an
i
was
fool
enough
for
all
that
to
try
an
believe
i
was
in
the
wrong
now
you
come
an
stand
before
me
why
i
could
a
thought
there
was
a
man
had
so
little
shame
in
him
hewett
entered
the
room
the
loud
angry
voice
had
reached
her
ears
and
in
spite
of
terror
she
came
to
interpose
between
the
two
men
you
know
what
he
come
to
tell
me
cried
her
husband
you
do
he
been
tryin
to
talk
you
over
has
he
you
just
answer
to
me
an
tell
the
truth
who
was
it
persuaded
me
to
let
clara
go
from
who
was
it
come
here
an
talked
an
talked
till
he
got
his
way
he
knew
what
be
the
end
of
it
he
knew
i
tell
you
an
it
just
what
he
wanted
has
he
been
drawin
away
from
us
ever
since
the
girl
left
i
saw
it
all
that
night
when
he
came
here
persuadin
me
an
i
told
it
him
plain
he
wanted
to
done
with
her
and
to
a
done
with
us
am
i
speakin
the
truth
or
not
should
he
think
that
way
john
pleaded
the
woman
faintly
know
very
well
as
clara
never
listen
to
him
what
need
had
he
to
do
such
things
yes
i
wrong
of
course
i
wrong
you
always
did
go
against
me
when
there
was
anything
to
do
with
clara
she
never
listen
to
him
no
of
course
she
would
an
he
could
rest
until
he
saw
her
come
to
harm
what
do
care
either
she
no
child
of
yours
but
i
tell
you
i
see
you
an
all
your
children
beg
an
die
in
the
streets
rather
than
a
hair
of
my
own
girl
head
should
be
touched
indulgence
of
his
passion
was
making
a
madman
of
him
never
till
now
had
he
uttered
an
unfeeling
word
to
his
wife
but
the
look
with
which
lie
accompanied
this
brutal
speech
was
one
of
fiery
hatred
turn
on
cried
sidney
with
bitterness
what
you
like
to
me
and
believe
the
worst
you
can
of
me
i
should
have
come
here
if
i
had
been
ready
to
bear
everything
it
no
good
speaking
reason
to
you
now
but
maybe
you
understand
some
day
know
as
she
come
to
harm
urged
hewett
can
say
it
of
her
for
certain
yet
have
told
him
that
if
he
only
listened
to
me
and
given
me
credit
for
honesty
said
kirkwood
is
as
likely
as
not
she
gone
away
just
because
i
angered
her
on
saturday
perhaps
she
said
to
herself
she
have
done
with
me
once
for
all
it
would
be
just
her
way
another
word
against
my
girl
hewett
shouted
misinterpreting
the
last
phrase
i
do
more
than
say
what
i
think
of
you
old
man
though
they
call
me
take
yourself
out
of
this
room
it
was
the
worst
day
of
my
life
that
ever
you
came
into
it
never
let
me
an
you
come
across
each
other
again
i
hate
the
sight
of
you
an
i
hate
the
sound
of
your
voice
the
animal
in
sidney
kirkwood
made
it
a
terrible
minute
for
him
as
he
turned
away
in
silence
before
this
savage
injustice
the
veins
upon
his
forehead
were
swollen
his
clenched
teeth
gave
an
appearance
of
ferocity
to
his
spirited
features
with
head
bent
and
shoulders
quivering
as
if
in
supreme
muscular
exertion
he
left
the
room
without
another
word
in
a
few
minutes
hewett
also
quitted
the
house
he
went
to
the
in
upper
street
and
heard
for
the
first
time
rancorous
surmises
he
went
to
clara
recent
lodgings
a
girl
of
ten
was
the
only
person
in
the
house
and
she
could
say
nothing
more
than
that
miss
hewett
no
longer
lived
there
till
midway
in
the
afternoon
john
walked
about
the
streets
of
islington
highbury
hoxton
clerkenwell
impelled
by
the
unreasoning
hope
that
he
might
see
clara
but
also
because
he
could
not
rest
in
any
place
he
was
now
of
the
madness
of
his
behaviour
to
kirkwood
but
this
only
confirmed
him
in
hostility
to
the
young
man
the
thought
of
losing
clara
was
anguish
intolerable
yet
with
it
mingled
a
bitter
resentment
of
the
girl
cruelty
to
him
and
all
these
sources
of
misery
swelled
the
current
of
rebellious
feeling
which
had
so
often
threatened
to
sweep
his
life
into
wreckage
he
was
clara
father
and
the
same
impulse
of
furious
revolt
which
had
driven
the
girl
to
recklessness
now
inflamed
him
with
the
rage
of
despair
on
a
only
a
few
insignificant
shops
remain
open
even
in
the
poor
districts
of
london
sweets
you
can
purchase
and
tobacco
but
not
much
else
that
is
sold
across
an
ordinary
counter
the
more
noticeable
becomes
the
brisk
trade
of
at
the
centres
the
life
of
each
street
here
is
a
wide
door
and
a
noisy
welcome
the
more
attractive
by
contrast
with
the
stretch
of
closed
shutters
on
either
hand
at
such
a
door
midway
in
the
sultry
afternoon
john
hewett
paused
to
look
at
his
stooping
shoulders
his
uncertain
swaying
this
way
and
that
his
flushed
perspiring
face
you
might
have
taken
him
for
one
who
had
already
been
drinking
no
it
was
only
a
struggle
between
his
despairing
wretchedness
and
a
lifelong
habit
of
mind
not
difficult
to
foresee
which
would
prevail
the
always
has
its
doors
open
in
expectation
of
such
instances
with
a
gesture
which
made
him
yet
more
like
a
drunken
man
he
turned
from
the
pavement
and
entered
about
nine
in
the
evening
just
when
hewett
had
put
the
unwilling
children
to
bed
and
had
given
her
baby
a
it
had
cried
incessantly
for
eighteen
hours
the
door
of
the
room
was
pushed
open
her
husband
came
in
she
stood
looking
at
him
unable
to
credit
the
evidence
of
her
eyes
she
laid
her
hand
upon
him
and
stared
into
his
face
the
man
shook
her
off
without
speaking
and
moved
staggeringly
forward
then
he
turned
round
waved
his
arm
and
shouted
her
go
to
the
devil
she
cares
nothing
for
her
father
he
threw
himself
upon
the
bed
and
soon
sank
into
drunken
sleep
chapter
xiv
a
welcome
guest
the
bells
of
james
clerkenwell
ring
melodies
in
intervals
of
the
pealing
for
one
morning
of
spring
their
music
like
the
rain
that
fell
intermittently
was
flung
westwards
by
the
boisterous
wind
away
over
clerkenwell
close
until
the
notes
failed
one
by
one
or
were
clashed
out
of
existence
by
the
clamour
of
a
less
civilised
steeple
had
the
wind
been
under
mortal
control
it
would
doubtless
have
blown
thus
violently
and
in
this
quarter
in
order
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
house
of
detention
might
derive
no
solace
from
the
melody
yet
i
know
not
just
now
the
bells
were
playing
is
a
happy
land
far
far
away
and
that
hymn
makes
too
great
a
demand
upon
the
imagination
to
soothe
amid
instant
miseries
in
peckover
kitchen
the
music
was
audible
in
bursts
clem
and
her
mother
however
it
neither
summoned
to
prepare
for
church
nor
lulled
into
a
mood
of
restful
reverie
the
two
were
sitting
very
close
together
before
the
fire
and
holding
intimate
converse
their
voices
kept
a
low
murmur
as
if
though
the
door
was
shut
they
felt
it
necessary
to
use
every
precaution
against
being
overheard
three
years
have
come
and
gone
since
we
saw
these
persons
on
the
elder
time
has
made
little
impression
but
clem
has
developed
noticeably
the
girl
is
now
in
the
very
prime
of
her
ferocious
beauty
she
has
grown
taller
and
somewhat
stouter
her
shoulders
spread
like
those
of
a
caryatid
the
arm
with
which
she
props
her
head
is
as
strong
as
a
carter
and
magnificently
moulded
the
head
itself
looks
immense
with
its
pile
of
glossy
hair
reddened
by
the
rays
of
the
fire
her
features
had
a
splendid
savagery
which
seemed
strangely
at
discord
with
the
paltry
surroundings
amid
which
she
sat
her
eyes
just
now
were
gleaming
with
a
crafty
and
cruel
speculation
which
would
have
become
those
of
a
barbarian
in
ambush
i
wonder
how
it
came
about
that
her
strain
after
passing
through
the
basest
conditions
of
modern
life
had
thus
reverted
to
a
type
of
ancestral
exuberance
only
he
does
hear
about
the
old
man
or
the
girl
from
somebody
said

been
afraid
of
it
ever
since
he
come
into
the

many
people
might
tell
him
you

to

is

not

about

her

and
a
metal
ornament
of
primitive
taste
gleamed
amid
her
hair
ai
no
mistake
she
asked
after
a
pause
jolly
sure
of
that
what
a
blessed
fool
you
must
be
did
they
advertise
in
the
papers
for
him
did
the
lawyers
themselves
say
as
it
was
something
to
his
advantage
do
you
say
yourself
as
jane
says
her
often
spoke
about
him
and
wished
he
could
find
him
how
can
it
be
a
mistake
if
it
was
only
bill
letter
we
had
to
go
on
you
might
talk
but
there
do
be
a
ijiot
it
turned
out
as
he
had
nothing
remarked
clem
resolutely
leave
him
if
i
was
married
fifty
times
her
mother
uttered
a
contemptuous
sound
at
the
same
time
she
moved
her
head
as
if
listening
some
one
was
in
fact
descending
the
stairs
he
comes
she
whispered
the
eggs
ready
an
i
make
the
corffee
a
tap
at
the
door
then
entered
a
tallish
man
of
perhaps
forty
though
he
might
be
a
year
or
two
younger
his
face
was
unwholesome
of
complexion
its
chief
peculiarity
was
the
protuberance
of
the
bone
in
front
of
each
temple
which
gave
him
a
curiously
animal
aspect
his
lower
lip
hung
and
jutted
forward
when
he
smiled
as
now
in
advancing
to
the
fire
it
slightly
overlapped
the
one
above
his
hair
was
very
sparse
he
looked
indeed
like
one
who
has
received
the
tonsure
the
movement
of
his
limbs
betokened
excessive
indolence
he
dragged
his
feet
rather
than
walked
his
attire
was
equally
suggestive
not
only
had
it
fallen
into
the
last
degree
of
shabbiness
having
originally
been
such
as
is
worn
by
a
man
above
the
mechanic
ranks
but
it
was
patched
with
dirt
of
many
kinds
and
held
together
by
a
most
inadequate
supply
of
buttons
at
present
he
wore
no
collar
and
his
waistcoat
exposed
a
red
shirt
you
all
and
this
morning
peckover
was
his
first
observation
as
he
dropped
heavily
into
a
wooden
shall
begin
to
think
that
colour
of
yours
ai
natural
dare
you
let
me
rub
it
with
a
handkerchief
i
dare
replied
clem
tossing
her
head
be
so
forward
mr
snowdon
not
i
behind
time
if
anything
i
hope
i
have
kept
you
from
church
he
chuckled
at
his
double
joke
mother
and
daughter
laughed
appreciatively
you
take
your
eggs
boiled
or
fried
inquired
peckover
to
give
me
eggs
are
you
well
i
no
objection
i
assure
you
and
i
think
i
have
them
fried
peckover
but
i
say
you
must
be
running
up
too
big
a
bill
the
lord
only
knows
when
i
shall
get
anything
to
do
and
it
ai
very
likely
to
be
a
thousand
a
year
when
it
does
come
that
all
right
replied
the
landlady
as
if
sordid
calculation
were
a
thing
impossible
to
her
ca
say
as
you
behaved
quite
straightforward
years
ago
snowdon
but
i
ai
one
to
make
a
row
about
bygones
an
as
you
say
you
put
it
all
straight
as
soon
as
you
can
well
i
wo
refuse
to
trust
you
once
more
snowdon
lay
back
in
the
chair
his
hands
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
his
legs
outstretched
upon
the
fender
he
was
smiling
placidly
now
at
the
preparing
breakfast
now
at
clem
the
latter
he
plainly
regarded
with
much
admiration
and
cared
not
to
conceal
it
when
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
announced
to
him
that
the
meal
was
ready
he
dragged
his
chair
up
to
the
table
and
reseated
himself
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
a
dish
of
excellent
ham
and
eggs
as
nearly
fresh
as
can
be
obtained
in
clerkenwell
invited
him
with
appetising
odour
a
large
cup
of
what
is
known
to
the
generality
of
english
people
as
coffee
steamed
at
his
right
hand
slices
of
new
bread
lay
ready
cut
upon
a
plate
a
slab
of
the
most
expensive
substitute
for
butter
caught
his
eye
with
yellow
promise
vinegar
and
mustard
appealed
to
the
refinements
of
his
taste
got
a
couple
more
eggs
if
you
like
them
doin
said
peckover
when
she
had
watched
the
beginning
of
his
attack
upon
the
viands
think
i
shall
manage
pretty
well
with
this
supply
returned
snowdon
as
he
ate
he
kept
silence
partly
because
it
was
his
habit
partly
in
consequence
of
the
activity
of
his
mind
he
was
in
fact
musing
upon
a
question
which
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
answer
in
any
satisfactory
way
the
meaning
of
all
this
he
asked
himself
and
not
for
the
first
time
makes
them
treat
me
in
this
fashion
a
week
ago
i
came
here
to
look
up
peckover
just
because
i
run
down
to
my
last
penny
and
i
did
know
where
to
find
a
night
lodging
i
got
an
idea
too
that
i
should
like
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
my
child
whom
i
left
here
nine
or
ten
years
ago
possibly
she
was
still
alive
and
might
welcome
the
duty
of
supporting
her
parent
the
chance
was
to
be
sure
that
the
girl
had
long
since
been
in
her
grave
and
that
peckover
no
longer
lived
in
the
old
quarters
if
i
discovered
the
woman
on
the
other
hand
she
was
not
very
likely
to
give
me
an
affectionate
reception
seeing
that
i
found
it
inconvenient
to
keep
sending
her
money
for
jane
keep
in
the
old
days
the
queer
thing
is
that
everything
turned
out
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
i
had
expected
peckover
had
rather
a
sour
face
at
first
but
after
a
little
talk
she
began
to
seem
quite
glad
to
see
me
she
put
me
into
a
room
undertook
to
board
me
for
a
while
till
i
find
work
and
i
wonder
when
be
and
blest
if
this
strapping
daughter
of
hers
seem
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
me
from
the
first
go
off
as
for
my
girl
i
told
she
was
carried
off
by
her
grandfather
my
old
dad
three
years
ago
and
where
they
went
nobody
knows
very
puzzling
all
this
how
on
earth
came
it
that
peckover
kept
the
child
so
long
and
did
send
her
to
the
workhouse
if
i
to
believe
she
took
a
motherly
kindness
for
the
poor
brat
but
that
wo
exactly
go
down
with
snowdon
he
seen
a
bit
too
much
in
his
knocking
about
the
world
still
what
if
i
making
a
mistake
about
the
old
woman
there
some
people
do
things
of
that
sort
upon
my
soul
i
known
people
be
kind
even
to
me
without
a
chance
of
being
paid
back
you
may
think
you
know
a
man
or
a
woman
and
then
all
at
once
they
go
and
do
something
you
have
taken
your
davy
could
possibly
happen
i
have
sworn
she
was
nothing
but
a
skinflint
and
a
lying
old
witch
and
so
she
maybe
the
chances
are
there
some
game
going
on
that
i
ca
see
through
make
inquiries
why
so
i
have
done
as
far
as
i
know
how
i
only
been
able
to
hit
on
one
person
who
knows
anything
about
the
matter
and
he
tells
me
it
true
enough
the
girl
was
taken
away
about
three
years
ago
but
he
no
idea
where
she
went
to
surely
the
old
man
must
be
dead
b
now
though
he
tough
well
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
got
a
good
berth
and
i
a
precious
sight
too
lazy
to
go
on
the
private
detective
job
here
this
girl
clem
the
finest
bit
of
flesh
i
seen
for
a
long
time
i
more
than
half
a
mind
to
see
if
she
wo
be
fool
enough
to
marry
me
i
not
a
fellow
that
the
truth
and
she
may
have
taken
a
real
liking
to
me
seems
to
me
that
i
should
have
come
in
for
a
comfortable
thing
in
my
old
age
if
i
have
a
daughter
to
provide
for
my
needs
at
all
events
i
shall
have
a
wife
who
can
be
persuaded
into
doing
so
when
the
old
woman
gets
out
of
the
way
i
must
have
a
little
quiet
talk
with
clem
the
opportunity
he
desired
was
not
long
in
offering
itself
having
made
an
excellent
breakfast
he
dragged
his
chair
up
to
the
fender
again
and
reached
a
pipe
from
the
where
he
had
left
it
last
night
tobacco
he
carried
loose
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
it
came
forth
in
the
form
of
yellowish
dust
intermingled
with
all
sorts
of
alien
scraps
when
he
had
lit
his
pipe
he
poised
the
chair
on
its
clasped
his
hands
over
his
bald
crown
and
continued
his
musing
with
an
air
of
amiable
calm
smoke
curled
up
from
the
corner
of
his
loose
lips
and
occasionally
removing
his
pipe
for
an
instant
he
spat
skilfully
between
the
bars
of
the
grate
assured
of
his
comfort
peckover
said
she
must
go
and
look
after
certain
domestic
duties
her
daughter
had
begun
to
clean
some
vegetables
that
would
be
cooked
for
dinner
old
may
you
be
clem
snowdon
inquired
genially
when
they
had
been
alone
together
for
a
few
minutes
that
to
you
guess
let
me
see
you
was
not
much
more
than
a
baby
when
i
went
away
you
be
eighteen
or
nineteen

sixth
of

grown
up

a
beauty

young
chaps

been
wanting
to
marry
you
eh
dozen
or
two
i
dessay
clem
replied
shrugging
her
shoulders
scornfully
snowdon
laughed
and
then
spat
into
the
fire
me
about
some
o
them
will
you
who
is
it
you
keeping
company
with
now
indeed
why
there

at
several
of
took
to
drinking
i
wo
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
excited
snowdon
mirth
in
a
high
degree
he
rolled
on
his
chair
and
almost
pitched
backwards
suppose
you
give
one
or
other
a
bit
of
encouragement
now
and
then
just
to
make
a
fool
of
him
eh
i

just
because

ha
i
believe
he
give
her
poison
an
risk
it
any
day
if
only
i
promised
to
marry
him
afterwards
then
there
was
a

a
domesticated
sort

clem
snapped
the
small
end
off
the
vegetable
she
was
paring
and
aimed
it
at
his
head
he
ducked
just
in
time
then
there
was
an
outburst
of
laughter
from
both
clem
you
have
got
a
glass
of
beer
in
the
house
have
to
wait
till

the

the
far
end
of
the
room
i
offended

me
get
on
with
my
work
ca
you
i
ca
you
just
come
here
you
better
not
give
me
the
trouble
of
fetching
you
the
girl
obeyed
him
her
cheeks
were
very
hot
and
the
was
flashing
in
her
eyes
ten
minutes
later
she
went
upstairs
and
had
a
vivacious
dialogue
of
whispers
with
peckover
chapter
xv
sunlight
in
dreary
places
among
the
of
clerkenwell
you
might
with
some
difficulty
have
discovered
an
establishment
known
in
its
neighbourhood
as
it
was
an
factory
and
the
rooms
of
which
it
consisted
were
only
to
be
reached
by
traversing
a
and
then
mounting
a
wooden
staircase
outside
a
here
at
busy
seasons
worked
some
threescore
women
and
girls
who
owing
to
the
nature
of
their
occupation
were
spoken
of
by
the
jocose
youth
of
the
locality
as
pastepots
naturally
they
varied
much
in
age
and
aspect
there
was
the
child
who
had
newly
left
school
and
was
now
invited
to
consider
the
question
of
how
to
keep
herself
alive
there
was
the
woman
of
uncertain
age
who
had
spent
long
years
of
long
days
in
the
atmosphere
of
workrooms
and
showed
the
result
in
her
parchmenty
cheek
and
eye
and
between
these
extremes
came
all
the
various
types
of
the
london
she
who
is
young
enough
to
hope
that
disappointments
may
yet
be
made
up
for
by
the
future
she
who
is
already
tasting
such
scanty
good
as
life
had
in
store
for
her
she
who
has
outlived
her
illusions
and
no
longer
cares
to
look
beyond
the
close
of
the
week
if
regularly
engaged
as
they
made
themselves
easy
in
the
prospect
of
wages
that
allowed
them
to
sleep
under
a
roof
and
eat
at
certain
intervals
of
the
day
if
employed
on
they
might
at
any
moment
find
themselves
wageless
but
this
being
a
familiar
state
of
things
did
not
trouble
them
with
few
exceptions
they
were
clad
neatly
on
the
whole
they
plied
their
task
in
wonderful
contentment
the
general
tone
of
conversation
among
them
was
not
high
moralists
unfamiliar
with
the
ways
of
the
nether
world
would
probably
have
applied
a
term
other
than
negative
to
the
laughing
discussions
which
now
and
then
enlivened
this
or
that
group
but
it
was
very
seldom
indeed
that
a
child
newly
arriving
heard
anything
with
which
she
was
not
already
perfectly
familiar
one
afternoon
at
the
end
of
may
there
penetrated
into
the
largest
of
the
workrooms
that
rarest
of
visitants
a
stray
sunbeam
only
if
the
sun
happened
to
shine
at
given
moments
could
any
of
its
light
fall
directly
into
the
room
i
speak
of
this
afternoon
however
all
circumstances
were
favourable
and
behold
the
floor
chequered
with
uncertain
gleam
the
workers
were
arranged
in
groups
of
three
called
consisting
of
a
learner
an
improver
and
a
hand
all
sat
with
sleeves
pushed
up
to
their
elbows
and
had
a
habit
of
rocking
to
and
fro
as
they
plied
their
mechanical
industry
owing
to
the
movement
of
a
cloud
the
sunlight
spread
gradually
towards
one
of
these
groups
it
touched
the
skirt
the
arms
the
head
of
one
of
the
girls
who
as
if
gladdened
by
the
kindly
warmth
looked
round
and
smiled
a
smile
you
would
have
been
pleased
to
observe
unconscious
gently
thoughtful
rich
in
possibilities
of
happiness
she
was
quite
a
young
girl
certainly
not
seventeen
and
wore
a
smooth
grey
dress
with
a
white
linen
collar
her
brown
hair
was
closely
plaited
her
head
the
bend
of
her
neck
very
graceful
from
her
bare
arms
it
could
be
seen
that
she
was
anything
but
robustly
made
yet
her
general
appearance
was
not
one
of
and
she
held
herself
even
thus
late
in
the
day
far
more
uprightly
than
most
of
her
companions
had
you
watched
her
for
a
while
you
would
have
noticed
that
her
eyes
occasionally
strayed
beyond
the
and
perhaps
unconsciously
fixed
themselves
for
some
moments
on
one
or
other
of
the
girls
near
her
when
she
remembered
herself
and
looked
down
again
upon
her
task
there
rose
to
her
face
a
smile
of
the
subtlest
meaning
the
outcome
of
busy
reflection
by
her
side
was
a
little
girl
just
beginning
to
learn
the
work
whose
employment
it
was
to
paper
wires
and
make
this
toil
always
results
in
blistered
fingers
and
frequent
was
the
child
appeal
to
her
neighbour
for
sympathy
be
easier
soon
said
the
latter
on
one
of
these
occasions
bending
her
head
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
should
have
seen
what
blisters
i
had
when
i
began
all
very
well
to
say
that
i
ca
do
no
more
so
there
oh
when
it
be
five
a
quarter
to
try
and
go
on
annie
five
did
come
at
length
and
with
it
twenty
minutes
rest
for
tea
the
rule
at
whitehead
was
that
you
could
either
bring
your
own
tea
sugar
and
eatables
or
purchase
them
here
from
a
forewoman
most
of
the
workers
chose
to
provide
themselves
it
was
customary
for
each
to
club
together
emptying
their
several
contributions
of
tea
out
of
little
twists
of
newspaper
into
one
teapot
wholesome
bustle
and
confusion
succeeded
to
the
former
silence
one
of
the
learners
whose
turn
it
was
to
run
on
errands
was
overwhelmed
with
commissions
to
a
chandler
shop
close
by
a
stupid
little
girl
she
was
and
they
called
her
because
of
her
slowness
the
horse
she
had
strange
habits
which
made
laughter
for
those
who
knew
of
them
for
instance
it
was
her
custom
in
the
to
go
apart
and
eat
her
poor
scraps
on
a
doorstep
close
by
a
she
confided
to
a
companion
that
the
odour
of
baked
joints
seemed
to
give
her
food
a
relish
from
her
present
errand
she
returned
with
a
strange
variety
of
dainties
for
it
was
early
in
the
week
and
the
girls
still
had
coppers
in
their
pockets
for
two
or
three
she
had
purchased
a
of
jam
which
she
carried
in
paper
a
bite
of
this
and
a
taste
of
that
rewarded
her
for
her
trouble
the
girl
whom
we
were
observing
took
her
cup
of
tea
from
the
pot
in
which
she
had
a
share
and
from
her
bag
produced
some
folded
pieces
of
bread
and
butter
she
had
begun
her
meal
when
there
came
and
sat
down
by
her
a
young
woman
of
very
different
appearance
our
friend
miss
peckover
they
were
old
acquaintances
but
when
we
first
saw
them
together
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
imagine
that
they
would
ever
sit
and
converse
as
at
present
apparently
in
all
friendliness
strange
to
say
it
was
clem
who
during
the
past
three
years
had
been
the
active
one
in
seeking
to
obliterate
disagreeable
memories
the
younger
girl
had
never
repelled
her
but
was
long
in
overcoming
the
dread
excited
by
clem
proximity
even
now
she
never
looked
straight
into
miss
peckover
face
as
she
did
when
speaking
with
others
there
was
reserve
in
her
manner
reserve
unmistakable
though
clothed
with
her
pleasant
smile
and
amiable
voice
got
something
to
tell
you
jane
clem
began
in
a
tone
inaudible
to
those
who
were
sitting
near
as
surprise
you
is
it
i
wonder
must
swear
you
wo
tell
nobody
jane
nodded
then
the
other
brought
her
head
a
little
nearer
and
whispered
goin
to
be
married
you
really
a
week
who
do
you
think
it
is
somebody
as
you
know
of
but
if
you
guessed
till
next
christmas
you
never
come
right
nor
had
clem
any
intention
of
revealing
the
name
but
she
laughed
consumedly
as
if
her
reticence
covered
the
most
amusing
situation
conceivable
be
the
biggest
surprise
you
ever
had
in
your
life
you
swore
you
wo
speak
about
it
i
do
think
i
shall
come
to
work
after
this
week
but
you
have
to
come
an
see
us
you
promise
to
wo
you
still
convulsed
with
mirth
clem
went
off
to
another
part
of
the
room
from
jane
countenance
the
look
of
amusement
which
she
had
perforce
summoned
soon
passed
it
was
succeeded
by
a
shadow
almost
of
pain
and
not
till
she
had
been
at
work
again
for
nearly
an
hour
was
the
former
placidity
restored
to
her
when
final
release
came
jane
was
among
the
first
to
hasten
down
the
wooden
staircase
and
get
clear
of
the
timber
yard
by
the
direct
way
it
took
her
twenty
minutes
to
walk
from
whitehead
to
her
home
in
hanover
street
but
this
evening
she
had
an
object
in
turning
aside
the
visit
she
wished
to
pay
took
her
into
a
disagreeable
quarter
a
street
of
squalid
houses
swarming
with
yet
more
squalid
children
on
all
the
doorsteps
bat
little
girls
themselves
only
just
out
of
infancy
nursing
or
neglecting
bald
abortions
in
every
stage
of
babyhood
hapless
spawn
of
diseased
humanity
born
to
embitter
and
brutalise
yet
further
the
lot
of
those
who
unwillingly
gave
them
life
with
wide
pitiful
eyes
jane
looked
at
each
group
she
passed
three
years
ago
she
would
have
seen
nothing
but
the
ordinary
and
the
inevitable
in
such
spectacles
but
since
then
her
moral
and
intellectual
being
had
grown
on
rare
nourishment
there
was
indignation
as
well
as
heartache
in
the
feeling
with
which
she
had
learnt
to
regard
the
world
of
her
familiarity
to
enter
the
house
at
which
she
paused
it
was
necessary
to
squeeze
through
a
conglomerate
of
dirty
little
bodies
at
the
head
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
she
came
upon
a
girl
sitting
in
a
weary
attitude
on
the
top
step
and
beating
the
wood
listlessly
with
the
last
remnant
of
a
on
her
lap
was
one
more
specimen
of
the
baby
and
a
child
of
two
years
sprawled
behind
her
on
the
landing
for
him
to
come
home
pennyloaf
said
jane
is
that
you
miss
snowdon
exclaimed
the
other
returning
to
consciousness
and
manifesting
some
shame
at
being
discovered
in
this
position
hastily
she
drew
together
the
front
of
her
dress
which
for
the
baby
sake
had
been
wide
open
and
rose
to
her
feet
pennyloaf
was
not
a
bit
more
womanly
in
figure
than
on
the
day
of
her
marriage
her
voice
was
still
an
immature
treble
the
same
rueful
irresponsibility
marked
her
features
but
all
her
poor
prettiness
was
wasted
under
the
disfigurement
of
pains
and
cares
incongruously
enough
she
wore
a
gown
of
calico
and
about
her
neck
had
a
collar
of
pretentious
lace
her
hair
was
dressed
as
if
for
a
holiday
and
a
daub
recently
made
on
her
cheeks
by
the
baby
fingers
lent
emphasis
to
the
fact
that
she
had
but
a
little
while
ago
washed
herself
with
much
care
ca
stop
said
jane
i
thought
i
just
look
in
and
speak
a
word
how
have
you
been
getting
on
do
come
in
for
just
a
minute
pleaded
pennyloaf
moving
backwards
to
an
open
door
whither
jane
followed
they
entered
a
room
much
like
other
rooms
that
we
have
looked
into
from
time
to
time
following
the
nomadic
custom
of
their
kind
bob
hewett
and
his
wife
had
lived
in
six
or
seven
different
lodgings
since
their
honeymoon
in
shooter
gardens
candy
first
of
all
made
a
change
necessary
as
might
have
been
anticipated
and
the
restlessness
of
domestic
subsequently
drove
them
from
place
to
place
in
johnny
she
called
to
the
child
lying
on
the
landing
the
good
o
washin
you
like
to
know
just
see
miss
snowdon
he
made
his
face
all
white
with
the
milk
as
the
boy
spilt
on
the
stairs
take
this
brush
an
play
with
it
do
i
keep
clean
miss
snowdon
so
it
no
use
talkin
you
going
somewhere
jane
inquired
with
a
glance
at
the
strange
costume
pennyloaf
looked
up
and
down
in
a
shamefaced
way
only
did
it
just
because
i
thought
he
might
like
to
see
me
he
promised
me
faithful
as
he
come
and
i
thought
only
somethink
as
got
into
my
miss
snowdon

he
been
coming
home
since
i
saw
you
last
did
just
once

then
it
was
all
the
old
ways
again
i
did
what
you
told
me
i
did
as
sure
as
i
i
made
the
room
so
clean
you
would
have
believed
i
scrubbed
the
floor
an
the
table
an
i
washed
the
winders
you
can
see
they
ai
dirty
yet
an
never
a
paid
a
bit
o
notice
if
i
had
told
him
he
was
jolly
enough
for
one
night
just
like
he
can
be
when
he
likes
but
i
knew
as
it
would
last
an
the
next
night
he
was
off
with
a
lot
o
fellers
girls
same
as
ever
i
did
make
no
row
when
he
came
i
wish
i
may
die
if
i
said
a
word
to
set
his
back
up
an
i
gone
on
just
the
same
all
the
week
we

had
not
the
least
bit
of
a
row
so

see
i
kep
my
promise
but
it
no
good
he
wo
come
always
got
fellers
an
girls
to
go
round
with
he
took
his
hoath
as
he
come
back
an
then
it
come
into
my
as
i
put
my
best
things
on
just
to
you
know
what
i
mean
miss
snowdon
but
he

i
know
he
wo
an
i

that
low
sittin
you
ca
think
i
ca
go
nowhere
because
o
the
children
if
it
was
for
them
i
could
go
to
work
again
an
i
be
that
glad
i
feel
as
if
my
would
drop
off
sometimes
i
so
glad
you
just
come
in
jane
had
tried
so
many
forms
of
encouragement
of
consolation
on
previous
occasions
that
she
knew
not
how
to
repeat
herself
she
was
ashamed
to
speak
words
which
sounded
so
hollow
and
profitless
this
silence
was
only
too
significant
to
pennyloaf
and
in
a
moment
she
exclaimed
with
querulous
energy
know
what
be
the
bend
of
it
i
go
an
do
like
mother
does
i
will
i
will
i
put
my
ring
away
an
i
go
an
sit
all
night
in
the
it
what
all
the
others
does
an
i
do
the
same
i
often
feel
i
a
fool
to
go
on
like
this
i
do
know
what
i
live
for
he
be
sorry
when
i
get
run
in
like
mother
talk
like
that
pennyloaf
cried
jane
stamping
her
foot
it
was
odd
how
completely
difference
of
character
had
reversed
their
natural
relations
to
each
other
pennyloaf
was
the
child
jane
the
mature
woman
know
better
and
you
no
right
to
give
way
to
such
thoughts
i
was
going
to
say
i
come
and
be
with
you
all
saturday
afternoon
but
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
now
and
i
been
thinking
you
might
like
to
come
and
see
me
on
sunday
but
i
ca
have
people
that
go
to
the
so
we
wo
say
anything
more
about
it
i
shall
have
to
be
off
she
stepped
to
the
door
snowdon
jane
turned
and
after
an
instant
of
mock
severity
broke
into
a
laugh
which
seemed
to
fill
the
wretched
den
with
sunlight
words
too
she
found
words
of
soothing
influence
such
as
leap
from
the
heart
to
the
tongue
in
spite
of
the
heavy
thoughts
that
try
to
check
them
pennyloaf
was
learning
to
depend
upon
these
words
for
strength
in
her
desolation
they
did
not
excite
her
to
much
hopefulness
but
there
was
a
sustaining
power
in
their
sweet
sincerity
which
made
all
the
difference
between
despair
tending
to
evil
and
the
sigh
of
renewed
effort
do
care
pennyloaf
had
got
into
the
habit
of
thinking
after
her
departure
wo
give
up
as
long
as
she
looks
in
now
and
then
out
from
the
swarm
of
babies
jane
hurried
homewards
she
had
a
reason
for
wishing
to
be
back
in
good
time
it
was
wednesday
and
on
wednesday
evening
there
was
wont
to
come
a
visitor
who
sat
for
a
couple
of
hours
in
her
grandfather
room
and
talked
talked
the
most
interesting
talk
jane
had
ever
heard
or
could
imagine
a
admitted
her
she
ran
up
to
the
second
floor
a
voice
from
the
caught
her
ear
certainly
not
voice
it
was
too
early
but
that
of
some
unusual
visitor
she
was
on
the
point
of
entering
her
own
chamber
when
the
other
door
opened
and
somebody
exclaimed
here
she
is
the
speaker
was
an
old
gentleman
dressed
in
black
bald
with
small
and
rather
rugged
features
his
voice
was
pleasant
a
gold
chain
and
a
bunch
of
seals
shone
against
his
waistcoat
also
a
pair
of
a
professional
man
obviously
jane
remembered
that
she
had
seen
him
once
before
about
a
year
ago
when
he
had
talked
with
her
for
a
few
minutes
very
kindly
you
come
in
here
jane
her
grandfather
voice
called
to
her
snowdon
had
changed
much
old
age
was
heavy
upon
his
shoulders
and
had
even
produced
a
slight
tremulousness
in
his
hands
his
voice
told
the
same
story
of
enfeeblement
even
more
noticeable
was
the
ageing
of
his
countenance
something
more
however
than
the
progress
of
time
seemed
to
be
here
at
work
he
looked
strangely
careworn
his
forehead
was
set
in
lines
of
anxiety
his
mouth
expressed
a
nervousness
of
which
formerly
there
had
been
no
trace
one
would
have
said
that
some
harassing
preoccupation
must
have
seized
his
mind
his
eyes
were
no
longer
merely
sad
and
absent
but
restless
with
fatiguing
thought
as
jane
entered
the
room
he
fixed
his
gaze
upon
her
a
gaze
that
appeared
to
reveal
worrying
apprehension
remember
percival
jane
he
said
the
old
gentleman
thus
presented
held
out
his
hand
with
something
of
fatherly
geniality
snowdon
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
again
before
long
but
just
now
i
am
carrying
off
your
grandfather
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
indeed
we
must
linger
that
number
of
minutes
you
look
well
i
think
he
stood
and
examined
her
intently
then
cried
my
dear
sir
come
we
shall
be
late
snowdon
was
already
prepared
for
walking
he
spoke
a
few
words
to
jane
then
followed
percival
downstairs
flurried
by
the
encounter
jane
stood
looking
about
her
then
came
a
rush
of
disappointment
as
she
reflected
that
the
visitor
of
wednesday
evenings
would
call
in
vain
hearing
that
her
grandfather
was
absent
doubtless
he
would
take
his
leave
at
once
or
would
he
in
a
minute
or
two
she
ran
downstairs
to
exchange
a
word
with
byass
on
entering
the
kitchen
she
was
surprised
to
see
bessie
sitting
idly
by
the
fire
at
this
hour
it
was
usual
for
byass
to
have
returned
and
there
was
generally
an
uproar
of
laughing
talk
this
evening
dead
silence
and
a
noticeable
something
in
the
air
which
told
of
trouble
the
baby
of
course
a
new
baby
lay
in
a
bassinette
near
its
mother
seemingly
asleep
the
other
child
was
sitting
in
a
high
chair
by
the
table
clattering
bessie
did
not
even
look
round
byass
late
inquired
jane
in
an
apprehensive
voice
somewhere
in
the
house
i
believe
was
the
answer
in
monotone
dear
jane
recognised
a
situation
which
had
already
come
under
her
notice
once
or
twice
during
the
last
six
months
she
drew
near
and
asked
in
a
low
voice
happened
mrs
byass
a
beast
if
he
does
mind
i
shall
go
and
leave
him
i
mean
it
bessie
was
in
a
genuine
fit
of
sullenness
one
of
her
hands
was
clenched
below
her
chin
her
pretty
lips
were
not
pretty
at
all
her
brow
was
rumpled
jane
began
to
seek
for
the
cause
of
dissension
to
put
affectionate
questions
to
use
her
voice
soothingly
a
beast
was
bessie
reiterated
observation
but
by
degrees
she
added
phrases
more
explanatory
can
i
help
it
if
he
cuts
himself
when
he
shaving
serve
him
right
what
for
why
for
saying
that
babies
was
nothing
but
a
nuisance
and
that
baby
was
the
ugliest
and
noisiest
ever
born
she
cry
in
the
night
inquired
jane
with
sympathy
course
she
did
has
she
a
right
to
then
byass
cut
himself
with
his
razor
and
he
said
it
was
because
he
was
woke
so
often
and
it
made
him
nervous
and
his
hand
shook
and
then
i
told
him
he
better
cut
himself
on
the
other
side
and
it
would
matter
and
then
he
complained
because
he
had
to
wait
for
breakfast
and
he
said
been
no
comfort
in
the
house
since
we
had
children
and
i
cared
nothing
about
him
he
said
and
only
about
the
baby
and
ernest
and
he
went
on
like
a
beast
as
he
is
i
hate
him
no
not
a
bit
of
it
said
jane
seeing
the
opportunity
for
a
transition
to
jest
do
and
you
may
go
upstairs
and
tell
him
so
right
i
will
jane
ran
upstairs
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
parlour
a
gruff
voice
bade
her
enter
but
the
room
was
nearly
in
darkness
you
have
a
light
mr
byass
thank
you
byass
byass
says
i
to
say
she
hates
you
right
tell
her
i
known
it
a
long
time
she
need
trouble
about
me
i
going
out
to
enjoy
myself
jane
ran
back
to
the
kitchen
byass
says
he
known
it
a
long
time
she
reported
with
much
gravity
he
going
out
to
enjoy
himself
bessie
remained
mute
message
shall
i
take
back
mrs
byass
him
if
he
dares
to
leave
the
house
i
go
to
mother
the
first
thing
and
let
them
know
how
he
treating

byass
reply
i
do
see
what
it
matters
to
her
whether
i
at
home
or
away
and
tell
her
she
a
cruel
wife
to
me
something
like
the
sound
of
a
snivel
came
out
of
the
darkness
as
he
concluded
jane
in
reporting
his
speech
added
that
she
thought
he
was
shedding
tears
thereupon
bessie
gave
a
sob
quite
in
earnest
am
i
she
said
chokingly
and
tell
him
jane
byass
byass
is
crying
whispered
jane
at
the
you
think
you
better
go
downstairs
hearing
a
movement
she
ran
to
be
out
of
the
way
samuel
left
the
dark
room
and
with
slow
step
descended
to
the
kitchen
then
jane
knew
that
it
was
all
right
and
tripped
up
to
her
room
humming
a
song
of
contentment
had
she
then
wholly
outgrown
the
bitter
experiences
of
her
childhood
had
the
cruelty
which
tortured
her
during
the
years
when
the
soul
is
being
fashioned
left
upon
her
no
brand
of
slavish
vice
nor
the
baseness
of
those
early
associations
affected
her
with
any
irremovable
taint
as
far
as
human
observation
could
probe
her
jane
snowdon
had
no
spot
of
uncleanness
in
her
being
she
had
been
rescued
while
it
was
yet
time
and
the
subsequent
period
of
fostering
had
enabled
features
of
her
character
which
no
one
could
have
discerned
in
the
helpless
child
to
expand
with
singular
richness
two
effects
of
the
time
of
her
bondage
were
however
clearly
to
be
distinguished
though
nature
had
endowed
her
with
a
good
intelligence
she
could
only
with
extreme
labour
acquire
that
elementary
which
vulgar
children
get
easily
enough
it
seemed
as
if
the
bodily
overstrain
at
a
critical
period
of
life
had
affected
her
memory
and
her
power
of
mental
application
generally
in
spite
of
ceaseless
endeavour
she
could
not
yet
spell
words
of
the
least
difficulty
she
could
not
do
the
easiest
sums
with
accuracy
geographical
names
were
her
despair
the
second
point
in
which
she
had
suffered
harm
was
of
more
serious
nature
she
was
subject
to
fits
of
hysteria
preceded
and
followed
by
the
most
painful
collapse
of
that
buoyant
courage
which
was
her
supreme
charm
and
the
source
of
her
influence
without
warning
an
inexplicable
terror
would
fall
upon
her
like
the
weakest
child
she
craved
protection
from
a
dread
inspired
solely
by
her
imagination
and
solace
for
an
anguish
of
wretchedness
to
which
she
could
give
no
form
in
words
happily
this
illness
afflicted
her
only
at
long
intervals
and
her
steadily
improving
health
gave
warrant
for
hoping
that
in
time
it
would
altogether
pass
away
whenever
an
opportunity
had
offered
for
struggling
successfully
with
some
form
of
evil
were
it
poor
pennyloaf
dangerous
despair
or
the
very
human
difficulties
between
bessie
and
her
husband
jane
lived
at
her
highest
reach
of
spiritual
joy
for
all
that
there
was
a
disappointment
on
her
mind
she
felt
this
joy
and
went
about
her
pursuits
in
happy
so
it
befell
that
she
did
not
hear
a
knock
at
the
byass
answered
it
and
not
knowing
that
snowdon
was
from
home
bade
his
usual
visitor
go
upstairs
the
visitor
did
so
and
announced
his
presence
at
the
door
of
the
room
kirkwood
said
jane
so
sorry
but
grandfather
had
to
go
out
with
a
gentleman
and
she
waited
looking
at
him
a
gentle
warmth
on
her
face
chapter

dialogue
and
comment
it
be
late
before
he
comes
back
asked
sidney
his
smile
of
greeting
shadowed
with
disappointment
later
than
ten
he
said
sidney
turned
his
face
to
the
stairs
the
homeward
prospect
was
dreary
after
that
glimpse
of
the
familiar
mom
through
the
doorway
the
breach
of
habit
discomposed
him
and
something
more
positive
strengthened
his
reluctance
to
be
gone
it
was
not
his
custom
to
hang
in
hesitancy
and
court
chance
by
indirectness
of
speech
recognising
and
admitting
his
motives
he
said
simply
should
like
to
stay
a
little
if
you
will
let
me
if
i
sha
be
in
your
way
no
please
come
in
i
only
sewing
there
were
two
wooden
chairs
in
the
room
one
stood
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
and
between
them
beside
the
table
jane
always
had
her
place
on
a
small
chair
of
the
ordinary
comfortless
kind
she
seated
herself
as
usual
and
sidney
took
his
familiar
position
with
the
vacant
chair
opposite
snowdon
and
he
were
accustomed
to
smoke
their
pipes
whilst
conversing
but
this
evening
sidney
dispensed
with
tobacco
it
was
very
quiet
here
on
the
floor
below
dwelt
at
present
two
sisters
who
kept
themselves
alive
it
is
quite
inaccurate
to
use
any
other
phrase
in
such
instances
by
doing
all
manner
of
skilful
needlework
they
were
women
and
so
thoroughly
subdued
to
the
hopelessness
of
their
lot
that
scarcely
ever
could
even
their
footfall
be
heard
as
they
went
up
and
down
stairs
their
voices
were
always
sunk
to
a
soft
murmur
just
now
no
infant
wailing
came
from
the
byasses
regions
kirkwood
enjoyed
a
sense
of
restfulness
intenser
perhaps
for
the
momentary
disappointment
he
had
encountered
he
had
no
desire
to
talk
enough
for
a
few
minutes
to
sit
and
watch
jane
hand
as
it
moved
backwards
and
forwards
with
the
needle
went
to
see
pennyloaf
as
i
came
back
from
work
jane
said
at
length
just
looking
up
you
do
things
seem
to
be
any
better
much
i
afraid
kirkwood
do
you
think
you
might
do
something
if
you
tried
again
with
her
husband
fact
is
replied
sidney
so
afraid
of
doing
more
harm
than
good
think
but
then
perhaps
that
just
what
doing
jane
let
her
hand
fall
on
the
sewing
and
regarded
him
anxiously
no
i
quite
sure
ca
do
harm
pennyloaf
can
get
nothing
but
good
from
having
you
as
a
friend
she
likes
you
she
misses
you
when
you
happen
not
to
have
seen
her
for
a
few
days
i
sorry
to
say
it
quite
a
different
thing
with
bob
and
me
we
friendly
enough
as
friendly
as
ever
but
i
have
a
scrap
of
influence
with
him
like
you
have
with
his
wife
it
was
all
very
well
to
get
hold
of
him
once
and
try
to
make
him
understand
in
a
way
that
he
behaving
as
well
as
he
might
he
did
take
it
amiss
just
that
once
but
you
ca
think
how
difficult
it
is
for
one
man
to
begin
preaching
to
another
the
natural
thought
is
mind
your
own
business
if
i
was
the
parson
of
the
parish
he
paused
and
in
the
same
instant
their
eyes
met
the
suggestion
was
irresistible
jane
began
to
laugh
merrily
what
sweet
laughter
it
was
how
unlike
the
shrill
discord
whereby
the
ordinary
workgirl
expresses
her
foolish
mirth
for
years
sidney
kirkwood
had
been
unused
to
utter
any
sound
of
merriment
even
his
smiling
was
done
sadly
but
of
late
he
had
grown
conscious
of
the
element
of
joy
in
jane
character
had
accustomed
himself
to
look
for
its
manifestations
to
observe
the
brightening
of
her
eyes
which
foretold
a
smile
the
moving
of
her
lips
which
suggested
inward
laughter
and
he
knew
that
herein
as
in
many
another
matter
a
profound
sympathy
was
transforming
him
sorrow
such
as
he
had
suffered
will
leave
its
mark
upon
the
countenance
long
after
time
has
done
its
kindly
healing
and
in
sidney
case
there
was
more
than
the
mere
personal
affliction
tending
to
confirm
his
life
in
sadness
with
the
ripening
of
his
intellect
he
saw
only
more
and
more
reason
to
condemn
and
execrate
those
social
disorders
of
which
his
own
wretched
experience
was
but
an
illustration
from
the
first
his
friendship
with
snowdon
had
exercised
upon
him
a
subduing
influence
the
old
man
was
stern
enough
in
his
criticism
of
society
but
he
did
not
belong
to
the
same
school
as
john
hewett
and
the
sober
authority
of
his
character
made
appeal
to
much
in
sidney
that
had
found
no
satisfaction
amid
the
uproar
of
clerkenwell
green
for
all
that
kirkwood
could
not
become
other
than
himself
his
vehemence
was
moderated
but
he
never
affected
to
be
at
one
with
snowdon
in
that
grave
enthusiasm
of
hope
which
at
times
made
the
old
man
speech
that
of
an
exhorting
prophet
their
natural
parts
were
reversed
the
young
eyes
declared
that
they
could
see
nothing
but
an
horizon
of
blackest
cloud
whilst
those
enfeebled
by
years
bore
ceaseless
witness
to
the
raying
forth
of
dawn
and
so
it
was
with
a
sensation
of
surprise
that
sidney
first
became
aware
of
in
the
young
girl
who
was
a
silent
hearer
of
so
many
lugubrious
discussions
ridiculous
as
it
may
sound
as
sidney
felt
it
to
be
he
almost
resented
this
evidence
of
happiness
to
him
only
just
recovering
from
a
shock
which
would
leave
its
mark
upon
his
life
to
the
end
his
youth
wronged
by
bitter
necessities
forced
into
brooding
over
problems
of
ill
when
nature
would
have
bidden
him
enjoy
it
seemed
for
the
moment
a
sign
of
shallowness
that
jane
could
look
and
speak
cheerfully
this
extreme
of
morbid
feeling
proved
its
own
cure
even
in
reflecting
upon
it
sidney
was
constrained
to
laugh
contemptuously
at
himself
and
therewith
opened
for
him
a
new
world
of
thought
he
began
to
study
the
girl
of
course
he
had
already
occupied
himself
much
with
the
peculiarities
of
her
position
but
of
jane
herself
he
knew
very
little
she
was
still
in
his
imagination
the
fearful
and
miserable
child
over
whose
shoulders
he
had
thrown
his
coat
one
bitter
night
his
impulse
towards
her
was
one
of
compassion
merely
justified
now
by
what
he
heard
of
her
mental
slowness
her
bodily
sufferings
it
would
take
very
long
to
analyse
the
process
whereby
this
mode
of
feeling
was
changed
until
it
became
the
sense
of
sympathy
which
so
possessed
him
this
evening
little
by
little
jane
happiness
justified
itself
to
him
and
in
so
doing
began
subtly
to
modify
his
own
temper
with
wonder
he
recognised
that
the
poor
little
serf
of
former
days
had
been
meant
by
nature
for
one
of
the
most
joyous
among
children
what
must
that
heart
have
suffered
so
scorned
and
trampled
upon
but
now
that
the
days
of
misery
were
over
behold
nature
having
its
way
after
all
if
the
thousands
are
never
rescued
from
oppression
if
they
perish
abortive
in
their
wretchedness
is
that
a
reason
for
refusing
to
rejoice
with
the
one
whom
fate
has
blest
sidney
knew
too
much
of
jane
by
this
time
to
judge
her
this
instinct
of
gladness
had
a
very
different
significance
from
the
animal
vitality
which
prompted
the
constant
laughter
of
bessie
byass
it
was
but
one
manifestation
of
a
moral
force
which
made
itself
nobly
felt
in
many
another
way
in
himself
sidney
was
experiencing
its
pure
effects
and
it
was
owing
to
his
conviction
of
jane
power
for
good
that
he
had
made
her
acquainted
with
bob
wife
snowdon
warmly
approved
of
this
the
suggestion
led
him
to
speak
expressly
of
jane
a
thing
he
very
seldom
did
and
to
utter
a
strong
wish
that
she
should
begin
to
concern
herself
with
the
sorrows
she
might
in
some
measure
relieve
sidney
joined
in
the
laughter
he
had
excited
by
picturing
himself
the
parson
of
the
parish
but
the
topic
under
discussion
was
a
serious
one
and
jane
speedily
recovered
her
gravity
i
see
how
hard
it
is
she
said
it
a
cruel
thing
for
him
to
neglect
poor
pennyloaf
as
he
does
she
never
gave
him
any
cause
knowingly
i
quite
believe
replied
kirkwood
what
a
miserable
home
it
is
jane
shook
her
head
does
seem
to
know
how
to
keep
things
in
order
she
does
seem
even
to
understand
me
when
i
try
to
show
her
how
it
might
be
different
the
root
of
the
trouble
jane
what
chance
had
pennyloaf
of
ever
learning
how
to
keep
a
decent
home
and
bring
up
her
children
properly
how
was
brought
up
the
wonder
is
that
there
so
much
downright
good
in
her
i
feel
the
same
wonder
about
people
every
day
suppose
pennyloaf
behaved
as
badly
as
her
mother
does
who
on
earth
would
have
the
right
to
blame
her
but
we
ca
expect
miracles
so
long
as
she
lives
decently
it
the
most
that
can
be
looked
for
and
there
you
are
that
is
enough
to
keep
a
fellow
like
bob
hewett
in
order
i
doubt
whether
any
wife
would
manage
it
but
as
for
poor
pennyloaf
shall
speak
to
him
myself
said
jane
quietly
there
much
more
hope
in
that
than
in
anything
i
could
say
bob
is
a
bad
fellow
the
worst
thing
i
know
of
him
is
his
conceit
and
he
clever
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
unfortunately
he
ca
think
of
anything
but
his
own
merits
of
course
he
no
business
to
marry
at
all
whilst
he
was
nothing
but
a
boy
jane
plied
her
needle
musing
you
know
whether
he
ever
goes
to
see
his
father
sidney
inquired
presently
i
do
jane
answered
looking
at
him
but
immediately
dropping
her
eyes
he
does
i
should
think
worse
of
him
nobody
ever
had
a
kinder
father
and
there
many
a
reason
why
he
should
be
careful
to
pay
the
debt
he
owes
jane
waited
a
moment
then
again
raised
her
eyes
to
him
it
seemed
as
though
she
would
ask
a
question
and
sidney
grave
attentiveness
indicated
a
surmise
of
what
she
was
about
to
say
but
her
thought
remained
unuttered
and
there
was
a
prolongation
of
silence
of
course
they
were
both
thinking
of
clara
that
name
had
never
been
spoken
by
either
of
them
in
the
other
presence
but
as
often
as
conversation
turned
upon
the
hewetts
it
was
impossible
for
them
not
to
supplement
their
spoken
words
by
a
silent
colloquy
of
which
clara
was
the
subject
from
her
grandfather
jane
knew
that
to
this
day
nothing
had
been
heard
of
hewett
daughter
what
people
said
at
the
time
of
the
girl
disappearance
she
had
learned
fully
enough
from
clem
peckover
who
even
yet
found
it
pleasant
to
revive
the
scandal
and
by
contemptuous
comments
revenge
herself
for
clara
haughty
usage
in
old
days
time
had
not
impaired
jane
vivid
recollection
of
that
morning
when
she
herself
was
the
first
to
make
it
known
that
clara
had
gone
away
many
a
time
since
then
she
had
visited
the
street
whither
snowdon
led
her
had
turned
aside
from
her
wonted
paths
in
the
thought
that
it
was
not
impossible
she
might
meet
clara
though
whether
with
more
hope
or
fear
of
such
a
meeting
she
could
not
have
said
when
two
years
had
gone
by
her
grandfather
one
day
led
the
talk
to
that
subject
he
was
then
beginning
to
change
in
certain
respects
the
tone
he
had
hitherto
used
with
her
and
to
address
her
as
one
who
had
outgrown
childhood
he
explained
to
her
how
it
came
about
that
sidney
could
no
longer
be
even
on
terms
of
acquaintance
with
john
hewett
the
conversation
originated
in
jane
bringing
the
news
that
hewett
and
his
family
had
at
length
left
peckover
house
for
two
years
things
had
gone
miserably
with
them
their
only
piece
of
good
fortune
being
the
death
of
the
youngest
child
john
was
confirmed
in
a
habit
of
drinking
not
that
he
had
become
a
brutal
sot
sometimes
for
as
much
as
a
month
he
would
keep
sober
and
even
when
he
gave
way
to
temptation
he
never
behaved
with
violence
to
his
wife
and
children
still
the
character
of
his
life
had
once
more
suffered
a
degradation
and
he
possessed
no
friends
who
could
be
of
the
least
use
to
him
snowdon
for
some
reason
of
his
own
maintained
a
slight
intercourse
with
the
peckovers
and
through
them
he
endeavoured
to
establish
an
intimacy
with
hewett
but
the
project
utterly
failed
probably
on
kirkwood
account
john
met
the
old
man
advances
with
something
more
than
coldness
sternly
he
had
forbidden
his
wife
and
the
little
ones
to
exchange
a
word
of
any
kind
with
sidney
or
with
any
friend
of
his
he
appeared
to
nourish
incessantly
the
bitter
resentment
to
which
he
gave
expression
when
sidney
and
he
last
met
there
was
no
topic
on
which
sidney
was
more
desirous
of
speaking
with
jane
than
this
which
now
occupied
both
their
minds
how
far
she
understood
clara
story
and
his
part
in
it
he
had
no
knowledge
for
between
snowdon
and
himself
there
had
long
been
absolute
silence
on
that
matter
it
was
not
improbable
that
jane
had
been
instructed
in
the
truth
he
hoped
she
had
not
been
left
to
gather
what
she
could
from
clem
peckover
gossip
yet
the
difficulty
with
which
he
found
himself
beset
now
that
an
obvious
opportunity
offered
for
frank
speech
was
so
great
that
after
a
few
struggles
he
fell
back
on
the
reflection
with
which
he
was
wont
to
soothe
himself
jane
was
still
so
young
and
the
progress
of
time
by
confirming
her
knowledge
of
him
would
make
it
all
the
simpler
to
explain
the
miserable
past
had
he
in
fact
any
right
to
relate
this
story
to
seek
her
sympathy
in
that
direct
way
it
was
one
aspect
of
a
very
grave
question
which
occupied
more
and
more
of
sidney
thought
with
an
effort
he
turned
the
dialogue
into
quite
a
new
direction
and
jane
though
a
little
absent
for
some
minutes
seemed
at
length
to
forget
the
abruptness
of
the
change
sidney
had
of
late
been
resuming
his
old
interest
in
two
or
three
of
his
drawings
hung
on
these
walls
and
he
spoke
of
making
new
sketches
when
he
next
went
into
the
country
years
ago
one
of
his
favourite
excursions
of
the
longer
ones
which
he
now
and
then
allowed
himself
was
to
danbury
hill
some
five
miles
to
the
east
of
chelmsford
one
of
the
few
pieces
of
rising
ground
in
essex
famous
for
its
view
over
maldon
and
the
estuary
of
the
blackwater
thither
snowdon
and
jane
accompanied
him
during
the
last
summer
but
one
and
the
former
found
so
much
pleasure
in
the
place
that
he
took
lodgings
with
certain
old
friends
of
sidney
and
gave
his
granddaughter
a
week
of
healthful
holiday
in
the
summer
that
followed
the
lodgings
were
again
taken
for
a
week
and
this
year
the
same
expedition
was
in
view
sidney
had
as
good
as
promised
that
he
would
join
his
friends
for
the
whole
time
of
their
absence
and
now
he
talked
with
jane
of
memories
and
anticipations
neither
was
sensible
how
the
quarters
and
the
went
by
in
such
chatting
sidney
abandoned
himself
to
the
enjoyment
of
peace
such
as
he
had
never
known
save
in
this
room
to
a
delicious
restfulness
such
as
was
always
inspired
in
him
by
the
girl
gentle
voice
by
her
laughter
by
her
occasional
quiet
movements
the
same
influence
was
affecting
his
whole
life
to
jane
he
owed
the
gradual
transition
from
tumultuous
politics
and
social
bitterness
to
the
mood
which
could
find
pleasure
as
of
old
in
nature
and
art
this
was
his
truer
self
emancipated
from
the
distorting
effect
of
the
evil
amid
which
he
perforce
lived
he
was
recovering
somewhat
of
his
spontaneous
boyhood
at
the
same
time
reaching
after
a
new
ideal
of
existence
which
only
ripened
manhood
could
appreciate
snowdon
returned
at
eleven
it
alarmed
sidney
to
find
how
late
he
had
allowed
himself
to
remain
and
he
began
shaping
apologies
but
the
old
man
had
nothing
but
the
familiar
smile
and
friendly
words
you
given
kirkwood
any
supper
he
asked
of
jane
looking
at
the
table
really
forgot
all
about
it
grandfather
was
the
laughing
reply
then
snowdon
laughed
and
sidney
joined
in
the
merriment
but
he
would
not
be
persuaded
to
stay
longer
chapter
xvii
clem
makes
a
disclosure
when
miss
peckover
suggested
to
her
affianced
that
their
wedding
might
as
well
take
place
at
the
seeing
that
there
would
then
be
no
need
to
go
to
expense
in
the
article
of
costume
snowdon
readily
assented
at
the
same
time
it
gave
him
new
matter
for
speculation
clem
was
not
exactly
the
kind
of
girl
to
relinquish
without
good
reason
that
public
ceremony
which
is
the
dearest
of
all
possible
ceremonies
to
women
least
capable
of
reverencing
its
significance
every
day
made
it
more
obvious
that
the
peckovers
desired
to
keep
this
marriage
a
secret
until
it
was
accomplished
in
one
way
only
could
joseph
james
account
for
the
mystery
running
through
the
whole
affair
it
must
be
that
miss
peckover
had
indiscretions
to
conceal
certain
points
in
her
history
with
which
she
feared
lest
her
bridegroom
should
be
made
acquainted
by
envious
neighbours
the
thought
had
no
effect
upon
snowdon
save
to
excite
his
mirth
his
attitude
with
regard
to
such
possibilities
was
that
of
a
philosopher
the
views
with
which
he
was
entering
upon
this
alliance
were
so
beautifully
simple
that
he
really
did
not
find
it
worth
while
to
puzzle
further
as
soon
as
the
plausible
solution
of
his
difficulties
had
presented
itself
should
he
hereafter
discover
that
something
unforeseen
perturbed
the
smooth
flow
of
life
to
which
he
looked
forward
nothing
could
be
easier
than
his
remedy
the
world
is
wide
and
a
cosmopolitan
does
not
attach
undue
importance
to
a
marriage
contracted
in
one
of
its
somewhat
numerous
parishes
in
any
case
he
would
have
found
the
temporary
harbour
of
refuge
which
stress
of
weather
had
made
necessary
he
surrendered
himself
to
the
pleasant
tickling
of
his
vanity
which
was
an
immediate
result
of
the
adventure
for
whatever
clem
might
be
hiding
it
seemed
to
him
beyond
doubt
that
she
was
genuinely
attracted
by
his
personal
qualities
her
demonstrations
were
not
extravagant
but
in
one
noteworthy
respect
she
seemed
to
give
evidence
of
a
sensibility
so
little
in
keeping
with
her
general
character
that
it
was
only
to
be
explained
as
the
result
of
a
strong
passion
in
conversing
with
him
she
at
times
displayed
a
singular
timidity
a
nervousness
a
surprisingly
unlike
anything
that
could
be
expected
from
her
it
was
true
that
at
other
moments
her
lover
caught
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
a
movement
of
her
lips
expressive
of
anything
rather
than
diffidence
and
tending
to
confirm
his
view
of
her
as
a
cunning
as
well
as
fierce
animal
but
the
look
and
tone
of
subjugation
came
often
enough
to
make
their
impression
predominant
one
would
have
said
that
she
suffered
from
jealous
fears
which
for
some
reason
she
did
not
venture
to
utter
now
and
then
he
surprised
her
gazing
at
him
as
if
in
troubled
apprehension
the
effect
of
which
upon
snowdon
was
perhaps
more
flattering
than
any
other
look
up
clem
he
inquired
on
one
of
these
occasions
you
wondering
whether
i
shall
cut
and
leave
you
when
we
had
time
to
get
tired
of
each
other
her
face
was
transformed
she
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
with
fierce
suspicion
then
laughed
disagreeably
see
about
that
was
her
answer
with
a
movement
of
the
head
and
shoulders
strongly
reminding
one
of
a
lithe
beast
about
to
spring
the
necessary
delay
passed
without
accident
as
the
morning
of
the
marriage
approached
there
was
however
a
perceptible
increase
of
nervous
restlessness
in
clem
she
had
given
up
her
work
at
whitehead
and
contrived
to
keep
her
future
husband
within
sight
nearly
all
day
long
joseph
james
found
nothing
particularly
irksome
in
this
for
beer
and
tobacco
were
supplied
him
and
a
succession
of
appetising
meals
made
the
underground
kitchen
a
place
of
the
pleasantest
associations
a
loan
from
peckover
had
enabled
him
to
renew
his
wardrobe
when
the
last
night
arrived
clem
and
her
mother
sat
conversing
to
a
late
hour
their
voices
again
cautiously
subdued
a
point
had
been
for
some
days
at
issue
between
them
and
decision
was
now
imperative
you
as
started
the
job
clem
observed
with
emphasis
you
as
have
to
finish
it
who
gets
most
out
of
it
i
like
to
know
replied
her
mother
be
such
a
fool
ca
you
see
as
it
come
easier
from
you
a
nice
thing
for
his
to
tell
him
if
you
do
like
to
do
it
the
first
day
then
leave
it
to
the
second
or
third
but
if
you
take
my
advice
you
get
it
over
the
next
morning
have
to
do
it
yourself
clem
repeated
stubbornly
propping
her
chin
upon
her
fists
i
never
thought
as
you
was
such
a
frightened
babby
frightened
of
a
feller
like
him
i
be
ashamed
o
myself
frightened
hold
your
row
you
are
what
else
ai
are
ai
you
better
not
make
me
mad
or
i
tell
him
before
just
to
spite
you
you
cat
what
difference
it
make
to
me
i
tell
you
what
i
a
jolly
good
mind
to
tell
him
myself
beforehand
and
then
we
see
who
spited
in
the
end
clem
yielded
shrugging
her
shoulders
defiantly
have
a
near
by
when
i
tell
him
she
remarked
with
decision
he
lays
a
hand
on
me
i
cut
his
face
open
an
chance
it
peckover
smiled
with
tender
motherly
deprecation
of
such
extreme
measures
but
clem
repeated
her
threat
and
there
was
something
in
her
eyes
which
guaranteed
the
possibility
of
its
fulfilment
no
personal
acquaintance
of
either
the
peckover
or
the
snowdon
family
happened
to
glance
over
the
list
of
names
which
hung
in
the
office
during
these
weeks
the
only
interested
person
who
had
foreknowledge
of
clem
wedding
was
jane
snowdon
and
jane
though
often
puzzled
in
thinking
of
the
matter
kept
her
promise
to
speak
of
it
to
no
one
it
was
imprudence
in
clem
to
have
run
this
risk
but
the
joke
was
so
rich
that
she
could
not
deny
herself
its
enjoyment
she
knew
moreover
that
jane
was
one
of
those
imbecile
persons
who
scruple
about
breaking
a
pledge
on
the
eve
of
her
she
met
jane
as
the
latter
came
from
whitehead
and
requested
her
to
call
in
the
close
next
sunday
morning
at
twelve
want
you
to
see
my
she
said
grinning
sure
like
him
jane
promised
to
come
on
the
next
day
saturday
clem
entered
the
in
a
plain
dress
and
after
a
few
simple
formalities
came
forth
as
snowdon
her
usual
high
colour
was
a
trifle
diminished
and
she
kept
glancing
at
her
husband
from
under
nervously
knitted
brows
still
the
great
event
was
unknown
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
close
there
was
no
feasting
and
no
for
the
present
and
snowdon
would
take
possession
of
two
rooms
on
the
first
floor
hours
later
when
the
bells
of
james
were
ringing
their
melodies
before
service
clem
requested
her
husband
attention
to
something
of
importance
she
had
to
tell
him
snowdon
had
just
finished
breakfast
and
was
on
the
point
of
lighting
his
pipe
with
the
match
burning
down
to
his
fingers
he
turned
and
regarded
the
speaker
shrewdly
clem
face
put
it
beyond
question
that
at
last
she
was
about
to
make
a
statement
definitely
bearing
on
the
history
of
the
past
month
at
this
moment
she
was
almost
pale
and
her
eyes
avoided
his
she
stood
close
to
the
table
and
her
right
hand
rested
near
the
her
left
held
a
piece
of
paper
is
it
asked
joseph
james
mildly
ahead
clem
ai
are
you
you
said
you
was
i
feller
you
could
have
come
across
look
at
me
smiling
his
grin
was
in
a
measure
reassuring
but
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
piece
of
paper
in
her
hand
and
eyed
it
steadily
know
you
played
mother
a
trick
a
long
time
ago
clem
pursued
you
went
off
an
left
that
child
on
her
what
about
that
it
would
be
nothing
but
fair
if
someone
was
to
go
and
play
tricks
with
just
to
pay
you
off
in
a
friendly
sort
o
way
see
snowdon
still
smiled
but
dubiously
with
it
he
muttered
have
bet
a
trifle
there
was
some
game
on
you
welcome
old
girl
out
with
it
you
know
as
i
got
a
brother
in
him
as
you
used
to
know
when
you
lived
here
before
said
you
did
know
where
he
was
more
we
do
not
just
now
but
he
wrote
mother
a
letter
about
this
time
last
year
an
there
something
in
it
as
i
like
you
to
see
you
better
read
for
yourself
her
husband
laid
down
his
pipe
on
the
and
began
to
cast
his
eye
over
the
letter
which
was
much
defaced
by
frequent
foldings
and
in
any
case
would
have
been
difficult
to
decipher
so
vilely
was
it
scrawled
but
snowdon
interest
was
strongly
excited
and
in
a
few
moments
he
had
made
out
the
following
communication
do
begin
with
no
deering
because
it
a
plaid
out
thing
and
because
i
riting
to
too
people
at
onse
both
mother
and
clem
and
it
so
long
since
i
had
a
pen
in
my
hand
i
harf
forgot
how
to
use
it
if
you
think
i
making
my
pile
you
think
rong
so
you
got
no
need
to
ask
me
when
i
going
to
send
money
home
like
you
did
in
the
last
letter
i
jest
keep
myself
and
that
about
all
because
things
ai
what
they
used
to
be
in
this
busted
up
country
and
that
remminds
me
what
it
was
as
i
ment
to
tell
you
when
i
cold
get
a
bit
of
time
to
rite
not
so
long
ago
i
met
a
chap
as
used
to
work
for
somebody
called
snowdon
and
from
what
i
can
make
out
it
was
brother
at
home
him
as
we
use
to
ere
so
much
about
he
made
his
pile
this
snowdon
you
bet
and
ned
williams
says
he
died
worth
no
end
of
thousands
not
so
long
before
he
died
his
old
farther
from
england
came
out
to
live
with
him
then
snowdon
and
a
son
as
he
had
both
got
drownded
going
over
a
river
at
night
and
ned
says
as
all
the
money
went
to
the
old
bloak
and
to
a
brother
in
england
and
that
what
he
herd
when
he
was
paid
off
the
old
farther
made
traks
very
soon
and
they
sed
he
gone
back
to
england
so
it
seams
to
me
as
you
ouht
to
find
snowdon
and
make
him
pay
up
what
he
ose
you
and
i
do
know
as
i
anything
more
to
tell
you
both
ecsep
i
working
at
a
place
as
i
do
know
how
to
spell
and
it
wold
be
no
good
if
i
did
because
there
no
saying
were
i
shall
be
before
you
could
rite

so
good
luck
to
you
both
from
yours
truly
in
reading
joseph
james
scratched
his
bald
head
thoughtfully
before
he
had
reached
the
end
there
were
signs
of
emotion
in
his
projecting
lower
lip
at
length
he
regarded
clem
no
longer
smiling
but
without
any
of
the
wrath
she
had
anticipated
ha
this
was
your
game
was
it
well
i
do
object
old
girl
so
long
as
you
tell
me
a
bit
more
about
it
now
there
no
need
for
any
more
lies
perhaps
you
mention
where
the
old
fellow
is
livin
not
so
far
away
an
jane
with
him
put
somewhat
at
her
ease
clem
drew
her
hand
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
and
detailed
all
she
knew
with
regard
to
old
snowdon
and
his
affairs
her
mother
had
from
the
first
suspected
that
he
possessed
money
seeing
that
he
paid
with
very
little
demur
the
sum
she
demanded
for
jane
board
and
lodging
true
he
went
to
live
in
poor
lodgings
but
that
was
doubtless
a
personal
eccentricity
an
important
piece
of
evidence
subsequently
forthcoming
was
the
fact
that
in
sundry
newspapers
there
appeared
advertisements
addressed
to
joseph
james
snowdon
requesting
him
to
communicate
with
percival
peel
of
furnival
inn
whereupon
peckover
made
inquiries
of
the
legal
firm
in
question
by
means
of
an
anonymous
letter
and
received
a
simple
assurance
that
snowdon
was
being
sought
for
his
own
advantage
cool
hands
you
and
your
mother
observed
joseph
james
with
a
certain
involuntary
admiration
was
not
quite
three
years
ago
you
say
just
when
i
was
in
america
ha
hum
what
i
ca
make
out
is
how
the
devil
that
brother
of
mine
came
to
leave
anything
to
me
we
never
did
anything
but
curse
each
other
from
the
time
we
were
children
to
when
we
parted
for
good
and
so
the
old
man
went
out
to
australia
did
he
that
a
rum
affair
too
mike
and
he
could
never
get
on
together
well
i
suppose
there
no
mistake
about
it
i
should
much
mind
if
there
was
just
to
see
the
face
pull
young
woman
on
the
whole
perhaps
it
as
well
for
you
that
i
fairly
eh
clem
stood
apart
smiling
dubiously
now
and
then
eyeing
him
askance
his
last
words
once
more
put
her
on
her
guard
she
moved
towards
the
table
again
me
the
address
said
her
husband
go
and
have
a
talk
with
my
relations
what
sort
of
a
girl
janey
grown
up
eh
you
wait
a
bit
you
can
see
for
yourself
she
goin
to
call
here
at
twelve
she
is
i
suppose
you
arranged
a
pleasant
little
surprise
for
her
well
i
must
say
you
a
cool
band
clem
i
should
wonder
if
she
been
in
the
house
several
times
since
i
been
here
she
has
it
would
have
been
safe
you
see
me
the
corkscrew
and
i
open
this
bottle
of
whisky
it
takes
it
out
of
a
fellow
this
kind
of
thing
here
to
you
clem
have
a
drink
all
right
go
downstairs
and
show
your
mother
you
alive
still
and
let
me
know
when
jane
comes
i
want
to
think
a
bit
when
he
had
sat
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
solitary
reflection
the
door
opened
and
clem
led
into
the
room
a
young
girl
whose
face
expressed
timid
curiosity
joseph
james
stood
up
joined
his
hands
under
his
and
examined
the
stranger
you
know
who
it
is
asked
clem
of
her
companion
husband
but
i
do
know
his
name
ought
to
it
seems
to
me
said
clem
giggling
at
him
jane
tried
to
regard
the
man
for
a
moment
her
cheeks
flushed
with
confusion
again
she
looked
at
him
and
the
colour
rapidly
faded
in
her
eyes
was
a
strange
light
of
painfully
struggling
recollection
she
turned
to
clem
and
read
her
countenance
with
distress
i
quite
sure
i
should
never
have
known
janey
said
snowdon
advancing
you
remember
your
father
yes
as
soon
as
consciousness
could
reconcile
what
seemed
impossibilities
jane
had
remembered
him
she
was
not
seven
years
old
when
he
forsook
her
and
a
life
of
anything
but
orderly
progress
had
told
upon
his
features
nevertheless
jane
recognised
the
face
she
had
never
had
cause
to
love
recognised
yet
more
certainly
the
voice
which
carried
her
back
to
childhood
but
what
did
it
all
mean
the
shock
was
making
her
heart
throb
as
it
was
wont
to
do
before
her
fits
of
illness
she
looked
about
her
with
dazed
eyes
down
sit
down
said
her
father
not
without
a
note
of
genuine
feeling
been
a
bit
too
much
for
you
like
something
else
was
for
me
just
now
put
some
water
in
that
glass
clem
a
drop
of
this
will
do
her
good
the
smell
of
what
was
offered
her
proved
sufficient
to
restore
jane
she
shook
her
head
and
put
the
glass
away
after
an
uncomfortable
silence
during
which
joseph
dragged
his
feet
about
the
floor
clem
remarked
wants
you
to
take
him
home
to
see
your
grandfather
jane
been
reasons
why
he
could
go
before
had
you
better
go
at
once
jo
jane
rose
and
waited
whilst
her
father
assumed
his
hat
and
drew
on
a
new
pair
of
gloves
she
could
not
look
at
either
husband
or
wife
presently
she
found
herself
in
the
street
walking
without
consciousness
of
things
in
the
homeward
direction
grown
up
a
very
nice
modest
girl
jane
was
her
first
observation
can
see
your
grandfather
has
taken
good
care
of
you
he
tried
to
speak
as
if
the
situation
were
perfectly
simple
jane
could
find
no
reply
thought
it
was
better
he
continued
in
the
same
voice
to
see
either
of
you
till
this
marriage
of
mine
was
over
i
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
life
i
tell
you
all
about
it
some
day
my
dear
and
i
wanted
just
to
settle
myself
before
i
dare
say
you
understand
what
i
mean
i
suppose
your
grandfather
has
often
spoken
to
you
about
me
very
often
father
was
the
murmured
answer
well
things
soon
be
set
right
i
feel
quite
proud
of
you
janey
i
do
indeed
and
i
suppose
you
just
keep
house
for
him
eh
go
to
work
as
well
you
go
to
work
how
that
i
wonder
miss
peckover
tell
you
joseph
laughed
the
girl
could
not
grasp
all
these
astonishing
facts
at
once
and
the
presence
of
her
father
made
her
forget
who
miss
peckover
had
become
mean
my
wife
janey
no
no
she
did
tell
me
you
went
to
work
an
accident
but
i
delighted
you
and
clem
are
such
good
friends
girl
is
she
jane
whispered
an
assent
doubt
your
grandfather
often
tells
you
about
australia
and
your
uncle
that
died
there
he
never
speaks
of
australia
and
i
never
heard
of
my
uncle
ha
hum
joseph
continued
his
examination
all
the
way
to
hanover
street
often
expressing
surprise
but
never
varying
from
the
tone
of
affection
and
geniality
when
they
reached
the
door
of
the
house
he
said
let
me
go
into
the
room
by
myself
i
think
it
be
better
alone
is
he
i
come
up
and
show
you
the
door
she
did
so
then
turned
aside
into
her
own
room
where
she
sat
motionless
for
a
long
time
chapter
xviii
the
joke
is
completed
michael
snowdon
to
distinguish
the
old
man
by
name
from
the
son
who
thus
unexpectedly
returned
to
him
professed
no
formal
religion
he
attended
no
sunday
service
nor
had
ever
shown
a
wish
that
jane
should
do
so
we
have
seen
that
he
used
the
bible
as
a
source
of
moral
instruction
jane
and
he
still
read
passages
together
on
a
sunday
morning
but
only
such
were
chosen
as
had
a
purely
human
significance
and
the
comments
to
which
they
gave
occasion
never
had
any
but
a
human
bearing
doubtless
jane
reflected
on
these
things
it
was
her
grandfather
purpose
to
lead
her
to
such
reflection
without
himself
dogmatising
on
questions
which
from
his
own
point
of
view
were
unimportant
that
jane
should
possess
the
religious
spirit
was
a
desire
he
never
lost
sight
of
the
single
purpose
of
his
life
was
involved
therein
but
formalism
was
against
the
bent
of
his
nature
born
and
bred
amid
the
indifference
of
the
london
working
classes
he
was
one
of
the
very
numerous
thinking
men
who
have
never
needed
to
cast
aside
a
faith
of
childhood
from
the
dawn
of
rationality
they
simply
stand
apart
from
all
religious
dogmas
unable
to
understand
the
desire
of
such
helps
to
conduct
untouched
by
spiritual
trouble
as
that
phrase
is
commonly
interpreted
and
it
seemed
that
jane
closely
resembled
him
in
this
matter
sensitive
to
every
prompting
of
humanity
instinct
with
moral
earnestness
she
betrayed
no
slightest
tendency
to
the
religion
of
church
chapel
or
a
promenade
of
the
salvation
army
her
she
spoke
of
it
altogether
without
intolerance
as
did
her
grandfather
but
never
dreamt
that
it
was
a
phenomenon
which
could
gravely
concern
her
prayers
she
had
never
said
enough
that
her
last
thought
before
sleeping
was
one
of
kindness
to
those
beings
amid
whom
she
lived
her
life
that
on
awaking
her
mind
turned
most
naturally
to
projects
of
duty
and
helpfulness
excepting
the
bible
snowdon
seldom
made
use
of
books
either
for
inquiry
or
amusement
very
imperfectly
educated
in
his
youth
he
had
never
found
leisure
for
enriching
his
mind
in
the
ordinary
way
until
it
was
too
late
as
an
old
man
he
had
so
much
occupation
in
his
thoughts
that
the
printed
page
made
little
appeal
to
him
till
quite
recently
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
walking
for
several
hours
daily
always
choosing
poor
districts
now
that
his
bodily
powers
were
sensibly
failing
him
he
passed
more
and
more
of
his
time
in
profound
brooding
so
forgetful
of
external
things
that
jane
on
her
return
from
work
had
more
than
once
been
troubled
by
noticing
that
he
had
taken
no
midday
meal
it
was
in
unconsciousness
such
as
this
that
he
sat
when
his
son
joseph
receiving
no
reply
to
his
knock
opened
the
door
and
entered
but
that
his
eyes
were
open
the
posture
of
his
body
and
the
forward
drooping
of
his
head
would
have
made
it
appear
that
he
slept
joseph
stepped
towards
him
and
at
length
the
old
man
looked
up
he
gazed
at
his
visitor
first
unintelligently
then
with
wonder
and
growing
emotion
jo
at
last
you
were
in
my
mind
only
a
few
minutes
ago
but
i
saw
you
as
a
boy
he
rose
from
the
chair
and
held
out
both
his
hands
trembling
more
than
they
were
wont
to
do
almost
wonder
you
knew
me
said
joseph
seventeen
years
since
we
saw
each
other
it
was
all
jane
could
do
to
remember
me
where
have
you
seen
her
at
the
house
in
the
close
it
was
me
she
went
to
see
but
she
did
know
it
i
just
been
married
to
miss
peckover
sit
down
again
father
and
let
talk
over
things
quietly
to
miss
peckover
repeated
the
old
man
as
if
making
an
effort
to
understand
the
words
why
did
you
come
here
before
joseph
gave
the
explanation
which
he
had
already
devised
for
the
benefit
of
his
daughter
his
manner
of
speaking
was
meant
to
be
very
respectful
but
it
suggested
that
he
looked
upon
the
hearer
as
suffering
from
feebleness
of
mind
as
well
as
of
body
he
supplemented
his
sentences
with
gestures
and
smiles
glancing
about
the
room
meantime
with
looks
of
much
curiosity
you
been
living
here
a
long
time
father
it
was
uncommonly
good
of
you
to
take
care
of
my
girl
i
dare
say
you
got
so
used
to
having
her
by
you
you
would
care
for
her
to
go
away
now
you
wish
to
take
jane
away
michael
inquired
gravely
no
not
i
why
it
nothing
but
her
duty
to
keep
you
company
and
be
what
use
she
can
she
happy
enough
that
i
can
see
well
well
i
gone
through
a
good
deal
since
the
old
days
father
and
i
not
what
you
used
to
know
me
i
gladder
than
i
can
say
to
find
you
so
easy
in
your
old
age
neither
mike
nor
me
did
our
duty
by
you
only
too
sure
i
wish
i
could
have
the
time
back
again
but
what
the
good
of
that
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
mike
he
died
in
australia
about
four
years
ago
he
now
well
i
been
in
america
but
i
never
got
so
far
as
australia
so
mike
dead
is
he
i
hope
he
had
better
luck
than
me
the
old
man
did
not
cease
from
examining
his
son
countenance
is
your
position
at
present
he
asked
after
a
pause
do
look
unprosperous
to
boast
of
father
i
gone
through
all
kinds
of
trades
in
the
states
i
both
made
and
lost
money
i
invented
a
new
method
of
but
it
did
me
no
good
and
then
i
gave
up
that
line
altogether
since
i
been
back
in
england
two
years
about
mostly
gone
in
for
canvassing
advertising
agencies
and
that
kind
of
thing
i
make
an
honest
living
and
that
about
all
but
i
wonder
if
things
go
a
bit
better
now
i
feel
as
if
i
was
settled
at
last
what
with
having
a
home
of
my
own
and
you
and
janey
near
at
hand
you
wo
mind
if
i
come
and
see
you
both
now
and
then
shall
hope
to
see
you
often
replied
the
other
still
keeping
his
grave
face
and
tone
been
my
strong
desire
that
we
might
come
together
again
and
i
done
the
best
i
could
to
find
you
but
as
you
said
we
been
parted
for
a
very
long
time
and
it
is
in
a
day
that
we
can
come
to
understand
each
other
these
seventeen
years
have
made
an
old
man
of
me
jo
i
think
and
speak
and
act
slowly
better
for
us
all
if
i
had
learned
to
do
so
long
ago
your
coming
was
unexpected
i
shall
need
a
little
time
to
get
used
to
the
change
it
makes
be
sure
that
true
enough
plenty
of
time
to
talk
over
things
as
far
as
i
concerned
father
the
less
said
about
bygones
the
better
it
the
future
that
i
care
about
now
i
want
to
put
things
right
between
us
as
they
ought
to
be
between
father
and
son
you
understand
me
i
hope
michael
nodded
keeping
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
again
there
was
a
silence
then
joseph
said
that
if
jane
would
come
in
and
speak
a
few
words
so
as
to
make
things
it
would
be
time
for
him
to
take
his
leave
for
the
present
at
her
grandfather
summons
jane
entered
the
room
she
was
still
oppressed
by
the
strangeness
of
her
position
and
with
difficulty
took
part
in
the
colloquy
joseph
still
touching
the
note
of
humility
in
his
talk
eyed
his
relatives
alternately
and
exhibited
reluctance
to
quit
them
when
he
returned
to
the
close
it
was
with
a
face
expressing
dissatisfaction
clem
eager
inquiries
he
met
at
first
with
an
phrase
or
two
which
informed
her
of
nothing
but
when
dinner
was
over
he
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
into
a
confidential
talk
in
which
peckover
took
part
the
old
man
he
remarked
was
devilish
close
it
looked
as
if
game
was
on
peckover
ridiculed
this
remark
of
course
there
was
a
game
on
she
spoke
of
sidney
kirkwood
the
influence
he
had
obtained
over
snowdon
the
designs
he
was
obviously
pursuing
if
joseph
thought
he
would
recover
his
rights
at
this
time
of
day
save
by
direct
measures
it
only
proved
how
needful
it
was
for
him
to
be
instructed
by
shrewd
people
the
old
man
was
a
hard
nut
to
crack
why
he
lived
in
hanover
street
and
sent
jane
to
work
when
it
was
certain
that
he
had
wealth
at
command
peckover
could
not
pretend
to
explain
but
in
all
probability
he
found
a
pleasure
in
accumulating
money
and
was
abetted
therein
by
sidney
kirkwood
clem
could
bear
witness
that
jane
always
seemed
to
have
secrets
to
hide
nevertheless
a
good
deal
of
information
had
been
extracted
from
the
girl
during
the
last
year
or
so
and
it
all
went
to
confirm
the
views
which
peckover
now
put
forth
after
long
discussion
it
was
resolved
that
joseph
should
call
upon
the
lawyers
whose
names
had
appeared
in
the
advertisement
addressed
to
himself
if
he
was
met
with
any
shuffling
or
if
they
merely
referred
him
to
his
father
the
next
step
would
be
plain
enough
clem
began
to
exhibit
sullenness
her
words
were
few
and
it
was
fortunate
for
joseph
that
he
could
oppose
a
philosophical
indifference
to
the
trouble
with
which
his
honeymoon
was
threatened
as
early
as
possible
on
monday
morning
he
ascended
the
stairs
of
a
building
in
furnival
inn
and
discovered
the
office
of
percival
and
feel
he
was
hesitating
whether
to
knock
or
simply
turn
the
handle
when
a
man
came
up
to
the
same
door
with
the
quick
step
of
one
at
home
in
the
place
with
us
inquired
the
newcomer
as
joseph
drew
back
they
looked
at
each
other
he
who
had
spoken
was
comparatively
a
young
man
dressed
with
much
propriety
gravely
polite
in
how
do
you
do
exclaimed
snowdon
with
embarrassment
and
in
an
undertone
was
expecting
the
recognition
was
mutual
and
whilst
joseph
though
disconcerted
expressed
his
feelings
in
a
familiar
smile
the
other
cast
a
quick
glance
of
uneasiness
towards
the
stairs
his
mouth
compressed
his
eyebrows
twitching
a
little
with
mr
percival
he
inquired
confidentially
but
without
joseph
familiar
accentuation
that
is
is
he
here
be
for
another
hour
anything
i
could
see
about
for
you
joseph
moved
in
uncertainty
debating
with
himself
their
eyes
met
again
we
might
have
a
word
or
two
about
it
he
said
meet
somewhere
else
perhaps
you
be
at
the
top
of
chancery
lane
at
six
with
a
look
of
mutual
understanding
they
parted
joseph
went
home
and
explained
that
to
his
surprise
he
had
found
an
old
acquaintance
at
the
lawyer
office
a
man
named
scawthorne
whom
lie
was
going
to
see
in
private
before
having
an
interview
with
the
lawyer
himself
at
six
the
appointed
meeting
took
place
and
from
chancery
lane
the
pair
walked
to
a
quiet
house
of
refreshment
in
the
vicinity
of
lincoln
inn
fields
on
the
way
they
exchanged
a
few
insignificant
remarks
having
reference
to
a
former
intimacy
and
a
period
during
which
they
had
not
come
across
each
other
established
in
a
room
with
a
modest
stimulant
to
aid
conversation
they
became
more
at
ease
scawthorne
allowed
himself
a
discreet
smile
and
joseph
fingering
his
glass
broached
the
matter
at
issue
with
a
cautious
question
you
know
anything
of
a
man
called
snowdon
snowdon
james
snowdon
a
friend
of
mine
your
people
advertised
for
him
about
three
years
ago
perhaps
you
have
been
at
the
office
as
long
as
that
yes
i
remember
the
name
what
about
him
people
wanted
to
find
him
something
to
his
advantage
do
you
happen
to
know
whether
it
any
use
his
coming
forward
now
scawthorne
was
not
distinguished
by
directness
of
gaze
he
had
handsome
features
and
a
not
unpleasant
cast
of
countenance
but
something
possibly
the
habit
of
professional
prudence
made
his
regard
coldly
fitfully
absently
observant
it
was
markedly
so
as
he
turned
his
face
towards
joseph
whilst
the
latter
was
speaking
after
a
moment
silence
he
remarked
without
emphasis
relative
of
yours
you
said
i
said
a
friend
intimate
friend
polkenhorne
knows
him
too
he
i
have
seen
polkenhorne
for
a
long
time
do
care
to
talk
about
the
business
perhaps
you
better
introduce
me
to
mr
percival
the
name
of
camden
it
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
snowdon
is
my
own
name
and
how
am
i
to
be
sure
of
that
and
see
me
where
i
living
in
clerkenwell
close
and
then
make
inquiries
of
my
father
in
hanover
street
islington
there
no
reason
now
for
keeping
up
the
old
name
a
little
affair
all
put
right
but
the
fact
is
i
as
soon
find
out
what
this
business
is
with
your
office
without
my
father
knowing
i
have
reasons
should
mind
talking
them
over
with
you
if
you
can
give
me
the
information
i
want
can
do
that
replied
scawthorne
with
a
smile
you
are
snowdon
you
are
requested
to
communicate
with
michael
snowdon
all
but
i
communicated
with
him
and
he
nothing
particular
to
say
to
me
as
far
as
i
can
see
scawthorne
sipped
at
his
glass
gave
a
stroke
to
each
side
of
his
moustache
and
seemed
to
reflect
were
coming
to
ask
percival
privately
for
information
just
it
of
course
if
you
ca
give
me
any
i
must
see
him
wo
tell
you
anything
more
than
i
have
you
do
anything
more
did
say
that
my
dear
fellow
suppose
you
begin
by
telling
me
a
little
more
about
yourself
it
was
a
matter
of
time
but
at
length
the
dialogue
took
another
character
the
glasses
of
stimulant
were
renewed
and
as
joseph
grew
expansive
scawthorne
laid
aside
something
of
his
professional
reserve
without
however
losing
the
discretion
which
led
him
to
subdue
his
voice
and
express
himself
in
uncompromising
phrases
their
sitting
lasted
about
an
hour
and
before
taking
leave
of
each
other
they
arranged
for
a
meeting
at
a
different
place
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
joseph
walked
homewards
with
deliberation
in
absent
mood
his
countenance
alternating
strangely
between
a
look
of
mischievous
jocoseness
and
irritable
concern
occasionally
he
muttered
to
himself
just
before
reaching
the
close
he
turned
into
a
when
he
came
forth
the
malicious
smile
was
on
his
face
and
he
walked
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
business
of
moment
before
him
he
admitted
himself
to
the
house
you
jo
cried
clem
voice
from
upstairs
sure
enough
was
the
reply
with
a
chuckle
up
sharp
then
humming
a
tune
joseph
ascended
to
the
on
the
first
floor
and
threw
himself
on
a
seat
his
wife
stood
just
in
front
of
him
her
sturdy
arms
her
look
was
fiercely
expectant
answering
in
some
degree
to
the
smile
with
which
he
looked
here
and
there
ca
you
speak
hurry
clem
no
hurry
my
dear
it
all
right
the
old
rolling
in
money
what
about
your
share
joseph
laughed
obstreperously
his
wife
brow
lowering
the
while
tell
me
ca
you
she
cried
course
i
will
the
best
joke
you
ever
heard
you
had
yours
yesterday
clem
my
turn
comes
my
share
is
just
nothing
at
all
not
a
penny
not
a
cent
swallow
that
old
girl
and
tell
me
how
it
tastes
a
liar
shouted
the
other
her
face
flushing
scarlet
her
eyes
aflame
with
rage
told
a
lie
in
my
life
replied
her
husband
still
laughing
noisily
but
for
that
last
glass
of
cordial
on
the
way
home
he
could
scarcely
have
enjoyed
so
thoroughly
the
dramatic
flavour
of
the
situation
joseph
was
neither
a
bully
nor
a
man
of
courage
the
joke
with
which
he
was
delighting
himself
was
certainly
a
rich
one
but
it
had
its
element
of
danger
and
only
by
abandoning
himself
to
riotous
mirth
could
he
overcome
the
nervousness
with
which
clem
fury
threatened
to
affect
him
she
coming
forward
in
the
attitude
of
an
enraged
fishwife
for
a
few
moments
made
the
room
ring
with
foul
abuse
that
vituperative
vernacular
of
the
nether
world
which
has
never
yet
been
exhibited
by
typography
and
presumably
never
will
be
it
clem
cried
her
husband
pushing
his
chair
a
little
back
it
my
angel
when
you
eased
your
mind
a
little
i
explain
how
it
happens
she
became
silent
glaring
at
him
with
murderous
eyes
but
just
at
that
moment
peckover
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
inquiring
up
in
if
you
want
to
know
cried
her
daughter
what
let
me
in
for
did
i
tell
you
as
it
might
be
all
a
mistake
oh
yes
you
may
look
peckover
was
startled
her
small
cunning
eyes
went
rapidly
from
clem
to
joseph
and
she
fixed
the
latter
with
a
gaze
of
angry
suspicion
a
bit
of
news
for
you
mother
resumed
joseph
nodding
and
clem
were
precious
artful
were
you
now
it
my
turn
now
thought
i
got
money
ha
ha
so
you
have
replied
peckover
know
all
about
it
so
you
need
try
your
little
game
all
about
it
do
you
well
see
here
my
brother
mike
died
out
in
australia
and
his
son
died
at
the
same
time
they
was
drowned
mike
left
no
will
and
his
wife
was
dead
before
him
what
the
law
eh
pity
you
did
make
sure
of
that
why
all
his
money
went
to
the
old
man
every
cent
of
it
i
no
claim
on
a
penny
that
the
law
my
pretty
dears
a
liar
roared
clem
who
at
the
best
of
times
would
have
brought
small
understanding
to
a
legal
question
did
my
brother
say
in
his
letter
was
told
wrong
that
all
or
else
he
got
the
idea
out
of
his
own
head
why
did
they
advertise
for
you
inquired
peckover
keeping
perfect
command
of
her
temper
old
man
thought
he
like
to
find
his
son
again
that
all
ha
ha
why
ca
you
take
it
clem
you
had
your
joke
yesterday
and
you
ca
say
i
cut
up
rough
about
it
i
a
fellow
i
am
there
many
a
man
would
have
broke
every
bone
in
your
body
my
angel
you
just
remember
that
it
rather
seemed
as
if
the
merry
proceeding
would
in
this
case
be
reversed
joseph
had
risen
and
was
prepared
to
defend
himself
from
an
onslaught
but
peckover
came
between
the
pair
and
by
degrees
induced
clem
to
take
a
calmer
view
of
the
situation
or
at
all
events
to
postpone
her
vengeance
it
was
absurd
she
argued
to
act
as
if
the
matter
were
hopeless
michael
snowdon
would
certainly
leave
joseph
money
in
his
will
if
only
the
right
steps
were
taken
to
secure
his
favour
instead
of
quarrelling
they
must
put
their
heads
together
and
scheme
she
had
her
ideas
let
them
listen
to
her
you
go
and
get
a
pot
of
old
six
for
supper
and
do
be
such
a
fool
was
her
final
remark
chapter
xix
a
retreat
visiting
his
friends
as
usual
on
sunday
evening
sidney
kirkwood
felt
before
he
had
been
many
minutes
in
the
room
that
something
unwonted
was
troubling
the
quiet
he
always
found
here
michael
snowdon
was
unlike
himself
nervously
inattentive
moving
frequently
indisposed
to
converse
on
any
subject
neither
had
jane
her
accustomed
brightness
and
the
frequent
glances
she
east
at
her
grandfather
seemed
to
show
that
the
latter
condition
was
causing
her
anxiety
she
withdrew
very
early
and
as
at
once
appeared
in
order
that
sidney
might
hear
in
private
what
had
that
day
happened
the
story
of
clem
marriage
naturally
occasioned
no
little
astonishment
in
sidney
how
will
all
this
affect
jane
he
asked
involuntarily
is
what
i
can
not
tell
replied
michael
troubles
me
my
son
is
a
stranger
all
these
years
have
made
him
quite
a
different
man
from
what
i
remember
and
the
worst
is
i
can
no
longer
trust
myself
to
judge
him
yet
i
must
know
the
truth
sidney
i
must
know
the
truth
it
hard
to
speak
ill
of
the
only
son
left
to
me
out
of
the
four
i
once
had
but
if
i
think
of
him
as
he
was
seventeen
years
ago
no
no
he
must
have
changed
as
he
has
grown
older
but
you
must
help
me
to
know
him
sidney
and
in
a
very
few
days
sidney
had
his
first
opportunity
of
observing
jane
father
at
this
meeting
joseph
seemed
to
desire
nothing
so
much
as
to
recommend
himself
by
an
amiable
bearing
impossible
to
speak
with
more
engaging
frankness
than
he
did
whilst
strolling
away
from
hanover
street
in
sidney
company
thereafter
the
two
saw
a
great
deal
of
each
other
joseph
was
soon
a
familiar
visitor
in
tysoe
street
he
would
come
about
nine
of
an
evening
and
sit
till
after
midnight
the
staple
of
his
talk
was
at
first
the
painfully
unnatural
relations
existing
between
his
father
his
daughter
and
himself
he
had
led
a
most
unsatisfactory
life
he
owned
it
deplored
it
that
the
old
man
should
distrust
him
was
but
natural
but
would
not
sidney
as
a
common
friend
do
his
best
to
dispel
this
prejudice
on
the
subject
of
his
brother
mike
he
kept
absolute
silence
the
accident
of
meeting
an
intimate
acquaintance
at
the
office
of
percival
and
peel
had
rendered
it
possible
for
him
to
pursue
his
inquiries
in
that
direction
without
it
becoming
known
to
michael
snowdon
that
he
had
done
anything
of
the
kind
and
the
policy
he
elaborated
for
himself
demanded
the
appearance
of
absolute
disinterestedness
in
all
his
dealings
with
his
father
aided
by
the
shrewd
peckover
he
succeeded
in
reconciling
clem
to
a
present
disappointment
bitter
as
it
was
by
pointing
out
that
there
was
every
chance
of
his
profiting
largely
upon
the
old
death
which
could
not
be
a
very
remote
contingency
at
present
there
was
little
that
could
be
done
save
to
curry
favour
in
hanover
street
and
keep
an
eye
on
what
went
forward
between
kirkwood
and
jane
this
latter
was
of
course
an
issue
of
supreme
importance
a
very
little
observation
convinced
joseph
that
his
daughter
had
learned
to
regard
sidney
as
more
than
a
friend
whether
there
existed
any
mutual
understanding
between
them
he
could
only
discover
by
direct
inquiry
and
for
the
present
it
seemed
wiser
to
make
no
reference
to
the
subject
he
preserved
the
attitude
of
one
who
has
forfeited
his
natural
rights
and
only
seeks
with
humility
the
chance
of
proving
that
he
is
a
reformed
character
was
or
was
not
kirkwood
aware
of
the
old
wealth
that
too
must
be
left
uncertain
though
it
was
more
than
probable
he
had
seen
the
advertisement
in
the
newspapers
and
like
peckover
had
based
conclusions
thereupon
another
possibility
was
that
kirkwood
had
wormed
himself
into
michael
complete
confidence
from
joseph
point
of
view
subtle
machinations
were
naturally
attributed
to
the
young
man
whose
appearance
proved
him
anything
but
a
commonplace
person
the
situation
was
full
of
obscurities
and
dangers
from
scawthorne
joseph
received
an
assurance
that
the
whole
of
the
australian
property
had
been
capitalised
and
placed
in
english
investments
also
that
the
income
was
regularly
drawn
and
in
some
way
disposed
of
the
manner
of
such
disposal
being
kept
private
between
old
percival
and
his
client
in
the
meantime
family
discussions
in
the
close
had
brought
to
knowledge
a
circumstance
regarding
kirkwood
which
interested
him
in
a
high
degree
when
talking
of
sidney
character
it
was
natural
that
the
peckovers
should
relate
the
story
of
his
relations
with
clara
hewett
exclaimed
snowdon
as
if
struck
by
the
name
has
she
what
sort
of
a
girl
to
look
at
clem
was
ready
with
a
malicious
description
whereto
her
husband
attended
very
carefully
he
mused
over
it
and
proceeded
to
make
inquiries
about
clara
family
the
hewetts
were
now
living
in
another
part
of
clerkenwell
but
there
was
no
hostility
between
them
and
the
peckovers
was
anything
to
be
gained
by
keeping
up
intimacy
with
them
joseph
after
further
musing
decided
that
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
do
so
suppose
clem
called
upon
them
and
presented
the
husband
of
whom
she
was
so
proud
he
would
like
if
possible
to
hear
a
little
more
about
their
daughter
an
idea
he
had
never
mind
exactly
what
so
this
call
was
paid
and
in
a
few
weeks
joseph
had
established
an
acquaintance
with
john
hewett
sidney
on
his
part
had
a
difficulty
in
coming
to
definite
conclusions
respecting
jane
father
of
course
he
was
prejudiced
against
the
man
and
though
himself
too
little
acquainted
with
the
facts
of
the
case
to
distinguish
joseph
motives
he
felt
that
the
return
was
anything
but
a
fortunate
event
for
michael
and
his
granddaughter
the
secret
marriage
with
clem
was
not
likely
in
were
not
lacking
grounds
for
hesitation
in
refusing
to
accept
any
case
to
have
a
respectable
significance
true
there
joseph
account
of
himself
he
had
a
fund
of
natural
amiability
he
had
a
good
provision
of
intellect
his
talk
was
at
times
very
persuasive
and
much
like
that
of
one
who
has
been
brought
to
a
passable
degree
of
honesty
by
the
slow
development
of
his
better
instincts
but
his
face
was
against
him
the
worn
sallow
features
the
eyes
which
so
obviously
made
a
struggle
to
look
with
frankness
the
vicious
lower
lip
awoke
suspicion
and
told
tales
of
base
experience
such
as
leaves
its
stamp
upon
a
man
for
ever
all
the
more
repugnant
was
this
face
to
sidney
because
it
presented
in
certain
aspects
an
undeniable
resemblance
to
jane
impossible
to
say
which
feature
put
forth
this
claim
of
kindred
but
the
impression
was
there
and
it
made
sidney
turn
away
his
eyes
in
disgust
as
often
as
he
perceived
it
he
strove
however
to
behave
with
friendliness
for
it
was
michael
desire
that
he
should
do
so
that
joseph
was
using
every
opportunity
of
prying
into
his
thoughts
of
learning
the
details
of
his
history
he
soon
became
perfectly
conscious
but
he
knew
of
nothing
that
he
need
conceal
it
was
impossible
that
sidney
should
not
have
reflected
many
a
time
on
michael
snowdon
position
and
have
been
moved
to
curiosity
by
hints
of
the
mysterious
when
he
thought
of
his
friends
in
hanover
street
as
it
happened
he
never
saw
those
newspaper
advertisements
addressed
to
joseph
and
his
speculation
had
nothing
whatever
to
support
it
save
the
very
few
allusions
to
the
past
which
michael
had
permitted
himself
in
the
course
of
talk
plainly
the
old
man
had
means
sufficient
for
his
support
end
in
all
likelihood
this
independence
was
connected
with
his
visit
to
australia
but
no
act
or
word
of
michael
had
ever
suggested
that
he
possessed
more
than
a
very
modest
competency
it
was
not
indeed
the
circumstances
so
much
as
the
character
and
views
of
his
friend
that
set
kirkwood
pondering
he
did
not
yet
know
michael
snowdon
of
that
he
was
convinced
he
had
not
fathomed
his
mind
got
at
the
prime
motive
of
his
being
moreover
he
felt
that
the
old
man
was
waiting
for
some
moment
or
some
event
to
make
revelation
of
himself
since
joseph
appearance
it
had
become
more
noticeable
than
ever
that
snowdon
suffered
from
some
agitation
of
the
mind
sidney
had
met
his
eyes
fixed
upon
him
in
a
painful
interrogation
and
seemed
to
discern
the
importunity
of
a
desire
that
was
refused
utterance
his
own
condition
was
affected
by
sympathy
with
this
restlessness
and
he
could
not
overcome
the
feeling
that
some
decisive
change
was
at
hand
for
him
though
nothing
positive
justified
the
idea
he
began
to
connect
this
anticipation
of
change
with
the
holiday
that
was
approaching
the
week
to
be
spent
in
essex
at
the
end
of
july
it
had
been
his
fear
that
joseph
presence
might
affect
these
arrangements
but
michael
was
evidently
resolved
to
allow
nothing
of
the
kind
one
evening
a
fortnight
before
the
day
agreed
upon
for
leaving
town
and
when
joseph
had
made
a
call
in
hanover
street
the
old
man
took
occasion
to
speak
of
the
matter
joseph
accepted
the
information
with
his
usual
pliancy
only
wish
my
wife
and
me
could
join
you
he
remarked
it
would
do
to
take
a
holiday
so
soon
after
settling
to
business
better
luck
for
me
next
year
father
let
hope
that
he
had
settled
to
business
was
a
fact
of
which
joseph
made
so
much
just
now
that
one
would
have
been
tempted
to
suppose
it
almost
a
new
experience
for
him
his
engagement
he
declared
was
with
a
firm
of
advertising
agents
in
the
city
nothing
to
boast
of
unfortunately
and
remunerative
only
in
the
way
of
commission
but
he
saw
his
way
to
better
things
my
girl
he
continued
averting
his
eyes
as
if
in
emotion
do
know
how
you
and
me
are
going
to
show
our
gratitude
for
all
this
kindness
i
sure
i
hope
you
have
got
so
used
to
it
that
you
think
there
no
need
to
thank
your
grandfather
the
girl
and
the
old
man
exchanged
a
look
joseph
sighed
and
began
to
speak
of
another
subject
in
a
tone
of
cheery
martyrdom
jane
herself
had
not
been
quite
so
joyous
as
was
her
wont
since
the
occurrence
that
caused
her
to
take
a
new
view
of
her
position
in
the
world
she
understood
that
her
grandfather
regarded
the
change
very
gravely
and
in
her
own
heart
awoke
all
manner
of
tremulous
apprehensions
when
she
tried
to
look
onward
a
little
to
the
uncertainties
of
the
future
forecasts
had
not
hitherto
troubled
her
the
present
was
so
rich
in
satisfactions
that
she
could
follow
the
bent
of
her
nature
and
live
with
no
anxiety
concerning
the
unknown
it
was
a
great
relief
to
her
to
be
assured
that
the
plans
for
the
holiday
would
suffer
no
change
the
last
week
was
a
time
of
impatience
resolutely
suppressed
on
the
saturday
afternoon
sidney
was
to
meet
them
at
liverpool
street
would
anything
happen
these
last
few
days
this
last
day
this
last
hour
no
all
three
stood
together
on
the
platform
and
their
holiday
had
already
begun
over
the
regions
of
east
london
sweltering
in
sunshine
which
served
only
to
reveal
the
intimacies
of
abomination
across
miles
of
a
city
of
the
damned
such
as
thought
never
conceived
before
this
age
of
ours
above
streets
swarming
with
a
nameless
populace
cruelly
exposed
by
the
unwonted
light
of
heaven
stopping
at
stations
which
it
crushes
the
heart
to
think
should
be
the
destination
of
any
mortal
the
train
made
its
way
at
length
beyond
the
outmost
limits
of
dread
and
entered
upon
a
land
of
level
meadows
of
hedges
and
trees
of
crops
and
cattle
michael
snowdon
was
anxious
that
jane
should
not
regard
with
the
carelessness
of
familiarity
those
desolate
tracts
from
which
they
were
escaping
in
bethnal
green
he
directed
her
attention
with
a
whispered
word
to
the
view
from
each
window
and
jane
had
learnt
well
to
understand
him
but
the
lesson
over
it
was
none
of
his
purpose
to
spoil
her
natural
mood
of
holiday
sidney
sat
opposite
her
and
as
often
as
their
eyes
met
a
smile
of
contentment
answered
on
face
they
alighted
at
chelmsford
and
were
met
by
the
farmer
in
whose
house
they
were
going
to
lodge
a
stolid
fellow
named
pammenter
with
red
leathery
cheeks
and
a
corkscrew
curl
of
black
hair
coming
forward
on
each
temple
his
trap
was
waiting
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
started
on
the
drive
to
danbury
the
distance
is
about
five
miles
and
until
danbury
hill
is
reached
the
countryside
has
no
point
of
interest
to
distinguish
it
from
any
other
representative
bit
of
rural
essex
it
is
merely
one
of
those
quiet
corners
of
flat
homely
england
where
man
and
beast
seem
on
good
terms
with
each
other
where
all
green
things
grow
in
abundance
where
from
of
old
tilth
and
are
humbly
observant
of
seasons
and
alternations
where
the
brown
roads
are
familiar
only
with
the
tread
of
the
labourer
with
the
light
wheel
of
the
farmer
gig
or
the
rumbling
of
the
solid
warn
by
the
roadside
you
pass
occasionally
a
mantled
pool
where
perchance
ducks
or
geese
are
enjoying
themselves
and
at
times
there
is
a
pleasant
glimpse
of
with
stacks
and
barns
and
stables
all
things
as
simple
as
could
be
but
beautiful
on
this
summer
afternoon
and
priceless
when
one
has
come
forth
from
the
streets
of
clerkenwell
farmer
pammenter
was
talkative
and
his
honest
sounded
pleasantly
but
the
matter
of
his
discourse
might
have
been
more
cheerful
here
as
elsewhere
the
evil
of
the
times
was
pressing
upon
men
and
disheartening
them
from
labour
farms
lying
barren
between
proprietor
and
tenant
between
tenant
and
hind
departure
of
the
tillers
of
the
soil
to
rot
in
towns
that
have
no
need
of
them
of
such
things
did
honest
pammenter
speak
with
many
a
sturdy
malediction
of
landlords
and
whereat
sidney
smiled
not
unsympathetic
danbury
hill
rising
to
the
village
church
which
is
visible
for
miles
around
with
stretches
of
heath
about
its
lower
slopes
with
its
far
prospects
over
the
sunny
country
was
the
pleasant
end
of
a
pleasant
drive
pammenter
and
her
children
seven
of
them
unhappily
gave
the
party
a
rough
welcome
ha
how
good
it
was
to
smell
the
rooms
through
which
the
pure
air
breathed
freely
all
the
front
of
the
house
was
draped
with
purple
clematis
in
the
garden
were
and
hollyhocks
and
lowly
plants
innumerable
on
the
red
and
lichened
tiles
pigeons
were
cooing
themselves
into
a
doze
the
horse
hoofs
rang
with
a
pleasant
clearness
on
the
stones
as
he
was
led
to
his
cool
stable
her
heart
throbbing
with
excess
of
delight
jane
pushed
back
the
casement
of
her
bedroom
the
same
room
she
had
occupied
last
year
and
the
year
before
and
buried
her
face
in
clematis
then
the
tea
that
pammenter
had
made
ready
how
delicious
everything
tasted
how
white
the
cloth
was
how
fragrant
the
cut
flowers
in
the
brown
jug
but
michael
had
found
the
journey
a
greater
tax
upon
his
strength
than
he
anticipated
whilst
sidney
and
jane
talked
merrily
over
the
the
old
man
was
thinking
year
they
will
come
without
me
and
he
smiled
just
to
hide
his
thoughts
in
the
evening
he
smoked
his
pipe
on
a
for
the
most
part
silent
and
at
sunset
he
was
glad
to
go
up
to
his
chamber
jane
was
renewing
her
friendship
with
the
pammenters
eldest
girl
an
ungraceful
but
lass
of
sixteen
their
voices
sounded
from
all
parts
of
the
garden
and
the
jane
laugh
contrasting
with
the
rougher
utterance
of
her
companion
after
supper
in
the
falling
of
the
dusk
sidney
strolled
away
from
the
gossiping
circle
and
found
a
corner
of
the
garden
whence
there
was
a
view
of
wooded
hillside
against
the
late
glow
of
the
heavens
presently
he
heard
footsteps
and
through
the
leafage
of
a
tree
that
shadowed
him
he
saw
jane
looking
this
way
and
that
as
if
she
sought
some
one
her
dress
was
a
light
calico
and
she
held
in
her
hand
a
rough
garden
hat
the
property
of
miss
pammenter
sidney
regarded
her
for
some
moments
then
called
her
by
name
she
could
not
see
him
at
first
and
looked
about
anxiously
he
moved
a
branch
of
the
tree
and
again
called
her
whereupon
she
ran
forward
thought
perhaps
you
gone
up
the
hill
she
said
resting
her
arms
on
the
wall
by
which
he
was
standing
then
they
kept
silence
enjoying
the
sweetness
of
the
hour
differently
it
is
true
for
kirkwood
natural
sensitiveness
had
been
developed
and
refined
by
studies
of
which
jane
had
no
conception
imperfect
as
his
instruction
remained
the
sources
of
spiritual
enjoyment
were
open
to
him
and
with
all
his
feeling
there
blended
that
reflective
bitterness
which
is
the
sad
privilege
of
such
as
he
delight
was
as
simple
as
the
language
in
which
she
was
wont
to
express
herself
she
felt
infinitely
more
than
pennyloaf
for
instance
would
have
done
under
the
circumstances
but
her
joy
consisted
in
the
main
of
a
satisfaction
of
pure
instincts
and
a
deep
sense
of
gratitude
to
those
who
made
her
life
what
it
was
she
could
as
little
have
understood
sidney
mind
at
this
moment
as
she
could
have
given
an
analytic
account
of
her
own
sensations
for
all
that
the
two
were
in
profound
sympathy
how
different
soever
the
ways
in
which
they
were
affected
the
result
as
they
stood
side
by
side
was
identical
in
the
hearts
of
both
sidney
began
to
speak
of
michael
snowdon
keeping
his
voice
low
as
if
in
fear
of
breaking
those
subtle
harmonies
wherewith
the
night
descended
must
be
careful
not
to
him
he
looked
very
pale
when
he
went
upstairs
i
thought
lately
that
he
must
suffer
more
than
he
tells
us
i
afraid
he
often
does
jane
assented
as
if
relieved
to
speak
of
it
he
always
says
it
nothing
to
trouble
about
nothing
but
what
is
natural
at
his
age
he
altered
a
great
deal
since
father
came
she
added
regarding
him
diffidently
hope
it
is
because
he
thinks
your
father
may
be
wanting
to
take
you
away
it
ca
be
that
oh
he
knows
i
would
leave
him
kirkwood
you
do
think
my
father
will
give
us
any
trouble
she
revealed
an
anxiety
which
delicacy
of
feeling
had
hitherto
prevented
her
expressing
sidney
at
once
spoke
reassuringly
though
he
had
in
fact
no
little
suspicion
of
joseph
snowdon
tactics
my
grandfather
that
i
ought
to
think
most
of
pursued
jane
earnestly
ca
feel
to
my
father
as
i
do
to
what
should
i
have
been
now
if
something
caused
her
to
leave
the
speech
unfinished
and
for
a
few
moments
there
was
silence
from
the
ground
exhaled
a
sweet
fresh
odour
soothing
to
the
senses
and
at
times
a
breath
of
air
brought
subtler
perfume
from
the
alleys
of
the
garden
in
the
branches
above
them
rustled
a
bird
wing
at
a
distance
on
the
country
road
sounded
the
trotting
of
a
horse
feel
ashamed
and
angry
with
myself
said
sidney
in
a
tone
of
emotion
i
think
now
of
t
hose
times
i
might
have
done
something
jane
i
had
no
right
to
know
what
you
were
suffering
and
just
go
by
as
if
it
did
matter
but
you
did
came
eagerly
from
the
girl
lips
forgotten
but
i
ca
you
were
very
kind
to
me
you
helped
me
more
than
you
can
think
you
never
saw
me
without
speaking
kindly
do
you
remember
that
night
when
i
came
to
fetch
you
from
the
workshop
and
you
took
off
your
coat
and
put
it
over
me
because
it
was
cold
and
raining
what
a
long
long
time
ago
that
seems
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
forget
it
never
you
were
the
only
friend
i
had
then
there
was
some
one
else
who
took
thought
for
you
said
sidney
regarding
her
gravely
jane
met
his
look
for
an
instant
they
could
just
read
each
features
in
the
pale
light
then
dropped
her
eyes
do
think
you
forgotten
that
either
he
added
in
the
same
unusual
voice
said
jane
below
her
breath
who
it
is
i
mean
mean
miss
hewett
was
the
reply
after
a
troubled
moment
wanted
you
to
say
her
name
you
remember
one
evening
not
long
ago
when
your
grandfather
was
away
i
had
the
same
wish
then
why
we
speak
of
her
she
was
a
friend
to
you
when
you
needed
one
badly
and
it
right
that
you
should
remember
her
with
gratitude
i
think
of
her
just
like
we
do
of
people
that
are
dead
jane
stood
with
one
hand
on
the
low
wall
to
him
but
her
face
bent
downwards
regarding
her
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
sidney
felt
as
though
the
fragrance
of
the
earth
and
the
flowers
were
mingling
with
his
blood
and
confusing
him
with
emotions
at
the
same
his
tongue
was
paralysed
frequently
of
late
he
had
known
a
timidity
in
presence
which
prevented
him
from
meeting
her
eyes
and
now
this
tremor
came
upon
him
with
painful
intensity
he
knew
to
what
his
last
words
had
tended
it
was
with
consciousness
of
a
distinct
purpose
that
he
had
led
the
conversation
to
clara
but
now
he
was
powerless
to
speak
the
words
his
heart
prompted
of
a
sudden
he
experienced
a
kind
of
shame
the
result
of
comparison
between
himself
and
the
simple
girl
who
stood
before
him
she
was
so
young
and
the
memory
of
passions
from
which
he
had
suffered
years
ago
affected
him
with
a
sense
of
unworthiness
almost
of
impurity
jane
had
come
to
be
his
ideal
of
maidenhood
but
till
this
moment
he
had
not
understood
the
full
significance
of
the
feeling
with
which
he
regarded
her
he
could
not
transform
with
a
word
their
relations
to
each
other
the
temptation
of
the
hour
had
hurried
him
towards
an
end
which
he
must
approach
with
more
thought
more
preparation
of
himself
it
was
scarcely
for
ten
then
jane
raised
her
eyes
and
said
in
a
voice
that
trembled
often
wished
i
could
see
her
again
and
thank
her
for
her
kindness
that
night
will
help
me
to
think
with
less
pain
of
things
that
are
long
since
over
and
done
with
sidney
replied
forcing
himself
to
speak
firmly
ca
alter
the
past
jane
but
we
can
try
to
remember
only
the
best
part
of
it
you
i
hope
very
seldom
look
back
at
all
wishes
me
never
to
forget
it
he
often
says
that
he
i
think
i
understand
jane
drew
down
a
branch
and
laid
the
broad
cool
leaves
against
her
cheek
releasing
it
she
moved
in
the
direction
of
the
house
her
companion
followed
with
slow
step
his
head
bent
before
they
came
to
the
door
jane
drew
his
attention
to
a
bat
that
was
sweeping
duskily
above
their
heads
she
began
to
speak
with
her
wonted
cheerfulness
i
should
like
pennyloaf
to
be
here
i
wonder
what
she
think
of
it
at
the
door
they
bade
each
other
good
night
sidney
took
yet
a
few
turns
in
the
garden
before
entering
but
that
it
would
have
seemed
to
the
pammenters
a
crazy
proceeding
he
would
have
gladly
struck
away
over
the
fields
and
walked
for
hours
chapter
xx
a
vision
of
noble
things
he
slept
but
for
an
hour
or
two
and
even
then
with
such
disturbance
of
fitful
dreams
that
he
could
not
be
said
to
rest
at
the
earliest
sound
of
movements
in
the
house
he
rose
and
went
out
into
the
morning
air
there
had
fallen
a
heavy
shower
just
after
sunrise
and
the
glory
of
the
east
was
still
partly
veiled
with
uncertain
clouds
heedless
of
sidney
strode
away
at
a
great
pace
urged
by
his
ungovernable
thoughts
his
state
was
that
miserable
one
in
which
a
man
repeats
for
the
thousandth
time
something
he
has
said
and
torments
himself
with
devising
possible
and
impossible
interpretations
thereof
through
the
night
he
had
done
nothing
but
imagine
what
significance
jane
might
have
attached
to
his
words
about
clara
hewett
why
had
he
spoken
of
clara
at
all
one
moment
he
understood
his
reasons
and
approved
them
the
next
he
was
at
a
loss
to
account
for
such
needless
revival
of
a
miserable
story
how
had
jane
interpreted
him
and
was
it
right
or
wrong
to
have
paused
when
on
the
point
of
confessing
that
he
loved
her
rain
caught
him
at
a
distance
from
home
and
he
returned
to
breakfast
in
rather
a
cheerless
plight
he
found
that
michael
was
not
feeling
quite
himself
and
would
not
rise
till
midday
jane
had
a
look
of
anxiety
and
he
fancied
she
behaved
to
him
with
a
constraint
hitherto
unknown
the
fancy
was
dispelled
however
when
later
in
the
morning
she
persuaded
him
to
bring
out
his
and
suggested
points
of
view
for
a
drawing
of
the
farm
that
had
been
promised
to
pammenter
himself
unable
to
recover
the
tone
of
calm
intimacy
which
till
yesterday
had
been
natural
between
them
sidney
found
himself
studying
the
girl
seeking
to
surprise
some
proof
that
she
too
was
no
longer
the
same
and
only
affected
this
unconsciousness
of
change
there
was
perhaps
a
little
less
readiness
in
her
eyes
to
meet
his
but
she
talked
as
naturally
as
ever
and
the
spontaneousness
of
her
was
assuredly
not
feigned
on
monday
the
farmer
had
business
in
maldon
occasionally
when
he
drove
over
to
that
town
he
took
one
or
other
of
his
children
with
him
to
visit
a
relative
and
he
proposed
that
jane
should
be
of
the
party
they
started
after
an
early
dinner
michael
and
sidney
stood
together
in
the
road
watching
the
vehicle
as
it
rolled
away
then
they
walked
in
silence
to
a
familiar
spot
where
they
could
sit
in
shadow
sidney
was
glad
of
jane
departure
for
the
afternoon
he
found
it
impossible
to
escape
the
restlessness
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
was
resolved
to
seek
relief
by
opening
his
mind
to
the
old
man
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
michael
already
understood
his
thoughts
and
no
better
opportunity
for
such
a
conversation
was
likely
to
present
itself
when
they
had
been
seated
for
a
minute
or
two
neither
speaking
sidney
turned
to
his
companion
with
a
grave
look
at
the
same
instant
michael
also
had
raised
his
eyes
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
saying
something
of
importance
they
regarded
each
other
the
old
face
was
set
in
an
expression
of
profound
feeling
and
his
lips
moved
tremulously
before
words
rose
to
them
were
you
going
to
say
sidney
he
asked
reading
the
features
which
i
hope
wo
be
displeasing
to
you
i
was
going
to
speak
of
jane
since
she
has
been
living
with
you
she
has
grown
from
a
child
to
a
woman
when
i
was
talking
with
her
in
the
garden
on
saturday
night
i
felt
this
change
more
distinctly
than
i
had
ever
done
before
i
understood
that
it
had
made
a
change
in
myself
i
love
her
snowdon
and
it
my
dearest
hope
that
she
may
come
to
feel
the
same
for
me
michael
was
more
agitated
than
the
speaker
he
raised
a
hand
to
his
forehead
and
closed
his
eyes
as
if
the
light
pained
them
but
the
smile
with
which
he
speedily
answered
sidney
look
of
trouble
was
full
of
reassurance
could
have
said
anything
that
would
give
me
more
pleasure
he
replied
just
above
his
breath
she
know
it
did
you
speak
to
her
were
talking
of
years
ago
and
i
mentioned
clara
hewett
i
said
that
i
had
forgotten
all
about
her
except
that
she
befriended
jane
but
nothing
more
than
that
i
could
say
what
i
was
feeling
just
then
partly
i
thought
that
it
was
right
to
speak
to
you
first
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
almost
as
if
i
should
be
treating
her
unfairly
i
so
much
older
she
knows
that
it
is
the
first
time
i
and
always
thought
of
me
just
as
a
friend
much
older
repeated
michael
with
a
grave
smile
both
children
to
my
sight
wait
and
let
me
think
a
bit
sidney
i
too
have
something
i
want
to
say
i
glad
you
spoken
this
afternoon
when
there
time
for
us
to
talk
just
wait
a
few
minutes
and
let
me
think
sidney
had
as
good
as
forgotten
that
there
was
anything
unusual
in
his
friend
circumstances
this
last
day
or
two
he
had
thought
of
nothing
but
jane
and
his
love
for
her
now
he
recalled
the
anticipation
originating
he
scarcely
knew
how
that
some
kind
of
disclosure
would
before
long
be
made
to
him
the
trouble
of
his
mind
was
heightened
he
waited
with
all
but
dread
for
the
next
words
think
i
told
you
michael
resumed
at
length
steadying
his
voice
joseph
is
my
youngest
son
and
that
i
had
three
others
three
others
michael
edward
and
robert
all
dead
edward
died
when
he
was
a
boy
of
fifteen
robert
was
killed
on
the
railway
he
was
a
porter
at
the
eldest
went
out
to
australia
he
took
a
wife
there
and
had
one
child
the
wife
died
when
they
been
married
a
year
or
two
and
michael
and
his
boy
were
drowned
both
together
i
was
living
with
them
at
the
time
as
you
know
but
what
i
never
spoken
of
sidney
is
that
my
son
had
made
his
fortune
he
left
a
deal
of
land
and
many
thousands
of
pounds
behind
him
there
was
no
finding
any
will
a
lawyer
in
the
nearest
town
a
man
that
had
known
him
a
long
time
said
he
felt
sure
there
been
no
will
made
so
as
things
were
the
law
gave
everything
to
his
father
he
related
it
with
subdued
voice
in
a
solemn
and
agitated
tone
the
effect
of
the
news
upon
sidney
was
a
painful
constriction
of
the
heart
a
rush
of
confused
thought
an
involvement
of
all
his
perceptions
in
a
sense
of
fear
the
pallor
of
his
cheeks
and
the
pained
parting
of
his
lips
bore
witness
to
how
little
he
was
prepared
for
such
a
story
begun
with
what
ought
by
rights
to
have
come
last
pursued
michael
after
drawing
a
deep
sigh
it
does
me
good
to
get
it
told
it
been
burdening
me
this
long
while
now
you
must
listen
sidney
whilst
i
show
you
why
i
kept
this
a
secret
i
no
fear
but
understand
me
though
most
people
would
it
a
secret
from
everybody
except
a
lawyer
in
london
who
does
business
for
me
a
man
he
is
in
most
things
and
i
glad
i
met
with
him
but
he
does
understand
me
as
you
will
he
thinks
i
making
a
mistake
my
son
knows
nothing
about
it
at
least
it
my
hope
and
belief
he
does
he
told
me
he
had
heard
of
his
brother
death
i
say
i
hope
he
does
know
it
is
selfishness
that
i
need
tell
you
i
never
for
a
minute
thought
of
myself
as
a
rich
man
sidney
i
never
thought
of
the
money
as
my
own
never
and
if
joseph
proves
himself
honest
i
ready
to
give
up
to
him
the
share
of
his
property
that
it
seems
to
me
ought
to
be
rightly
his
though
the
law
for
some
reason
looks
at
it
in
a
different
way
i
ready
but
i
must
know
that
he
an
honest
man
i
must
prove
him
first
the
eagerness
of
his
thought
impelled
him
to
repetitions
and
emphasis
his
voice
fell
upon
a
note
of
feebleness
and
with
an
effort
he
recovered
the
tone
in
which
he
had
begun
soon
as
i
knew
that
all
this
wealth
had
fallen
to
me
i
decided
at
once
to
come
back
to
england
what
could
i
do
out
there
i
decided
to
come
to
england
but
i
could
see
farther
ahead
than
that
i
sold
all
the
land
i
had
the
business
done
for
me
by
that
lawyer
i
spoke
of
that
had
known
my
son
and
he
recommended
me
to
a
percival
in
london
i
came
back
and
i
found
little
jane
and
then
bit
by
bit
i
began
to
understand
what
my
duty
was
it
got
clear
in
my
mind
i
formed
a
purpose
a
plan
and
it
as
strong
in
me
now
as
ever
let
me
think
again
for
a
little
sidney
i
want
to
make
it
as
plain
to
you
as
it
is
to
me
you
understand
me
best
if
i
go
back
and
tell
you
more
than
i
have
done
yet
about
my
life
before
i
left
england
let
me
think
a
while
he
was
overcome
with
a
fear
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
convey
with
sufficient
force
the
design
which
had
wholly
possessed
him
so
painful
was
the
struggle
in
him
between
enthusiasm
and
a
consciousness
of
failing
faculties
that
sidney
grasped
his
hand
and
begged
him
to
speak
simply
without
effort
no
fear
about
my
understanding
you
we
talked
a
great
deal
together
and
i
know
very
well
what
your
strongest
motives
are
trust
me
to
sympathise
with
you
do
if
i
had
that
trust
sidney
i
could
have
felt
the
joy
i
did
when
you
spoke
to
me
of
my
jane
you
help
me
to
carry
out
my
plan
you
and
jane
will
you
and
jane
i
got
to
be
such
an
old
man
all
at
once
as
it
seems
and
i
durs
have
waited
much
longer
without
telling
you
what
i
had
in
my
mind
see
now
i
go
back
to
when
i
was
a
boy
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
you
know
i
was
born
in
clerkenwell
and
i
told
you
a
little
now
and
then
of
the
hard
times
i
went
through
my
poor
father
and
mother
came
out
of
the
country
thinking
to
better
themselves
instead
of
that
they
found
nothing
but
cold
and
hunger
and
toil
and
moil
they
were
both
dead
by
when
i
was
between
thirteen
and
fourteen
they
died
in
the
same
winter
a
cruel
winter
i
used
to
go
about
begging
bits
of
firewood
from
the
neighbours
there
was
a
man
in
our
house
who
kept
dogs
and
i
remember
once
catching
hold
of
a
bit
of
dirty
meat
i
ca
call
it
meat
that
one
of
them
had
gnawed
and
left
on
the
stairs
and
i
ate
it
as
if
been
a
dog
myself
i
was
that
driven
with
hunger
why
i
feel
the
cold
and
the
hunger
at
this
minute
it
was
a
cruel
winter
that
and
it
left
me
alone
i
had
to
get
my
own
living
as
best
i
could
teaching
i
was
nineteen
before
i
could
read
the
signs
over
shops
or
write
my
own
name
between
nineteen
and
twenty
i
got
all
the
education
i
ever
was
to
have
paying
a
man
with
what
i
could
save
out
of
my
earnings
the
blessing
was
i
had
health
and
strength
and
with
hard
struggling
i
got
into
a
regular
employment
at
i
could
earn
my
pound
a
week
pretty
certain
when
it
got
to
five
shillings
more
i
must
needs
have
a
wife
to
share
it
with
me
my
poor
girl
came
to
live
with
me
in
a
room
in
hill
street
i
never
spoken
to
you
of
her
but
you
shall
hear
it
all
now
cost
me
what
it
may
in
the
telling
of
course
she
was
out
of
a
poor
home
and
she
known
as
well
as
me
what
it
was
to
go
cold
and
hungry
i
sometimes
think
sidney
i
can
see
a
look
of
her
in
jane
face
but
she
was
prettier
than
jane
yes
yes
prettier
than
jane
and
to
think
a
man
could
treat
a
poor
little
thing
like
her
the
way
i
did
you
do
know
what
sort
of
a
man
michael
snowdon
was
then
no
you
know
what
i
was
then
you
not
to
think
i
her
in
the
common
way
i
never
raised
my
hand
thank
god
and
i
never
spoke
a
word
a
man
should
be
ashamed
of
but
i
was
a
hard
stubborn
fool
how
she
came
to
like
me
and
to
marry
me
i
do
know
we
were
so
different
in
every
way
well
it
was
partly
my
nature
and
partly
what
i
gone
through
we
had
been
married
more
than
a
month
or
two
when
i
began
to
find
fault
with
her
and
from
that
day
on
she
could
never
please
me
i
earned
shillings
a
week
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
we
must
save
out
of
it
i
would
let
work
no
what
had
to
do
was
to
keep
the
home
on
as
little
as
possible
and
always
have
everything
clean
and
straight
when
i
got
back
at
night
but
jenny
had
the
same
ideas
about
things
as
i
had
she
could
pinch
and
pare
and
our
plans
of
saving
came
to
nothing
it
grew
worse
as
the
children
were
horn
the
more
need
there
was
for
carefulness
the
more
heedless
jenny
seemed
to
get
and
it
was
my
fault
mine
from
beginning
to
end
another
man
would
have
been
gentle
with
her
and
showed
her
kindly
when
she
was
wrong
and
have
been
thankful
for
the
love
she
gave
him
whatever
her
faults
that
was
my
way
i
got
angry
and
made
her
life
a
burden
to
her
i
must
have
things
done
exactly
as
i
wished
if
not
there
was
no
end
to
my
and
yet
if
you
believe
it
i
loved
my
wife
as
truly
as
man
ever
did
jenny
could
understand
that
and
how
should
she
at
last
she
began
to
deceive
me
in
all
sorts
of
little
things
she
got
into
debt
with
she
showed
me
false
accounts
she
pawned
things
without
my
knowing
last
of
all
she
began
to
drink
our
fourth
child
was
born
just
at
that
time
jenny
had
a
bad
illness
and
i
believe
it
set
her
mind
wrong
i
lost
all
control
of
her
and
she
used
to
say
if
it
was
for
the
children
she
go
and
leave
me
one
morning
we
quarrelled
very
badly
and
i
did
as
threatened
to
i
walked
about
the
streets
all
the
night
that
followed
never
coming
home
i
went
to
work
next
day
but
at
i
got
frightened
and
ran
home
just
to
speak
a
word
little
mike
the
eldest
was
playing
on
the
stairs
and
he
said
his
mother
was
asleep
i
went
into
the
room
and
saw
jenny
lying
on
the
bed
dressed
there
was
something
queer
in
the
way
her
arms
were
stretched
out
when
i
got
near
i
saw
she
was
dead
she
taken
poison
it
was
i
had
killed
her
just
as
much
as
if
i
put
the
poison
to
her
lips
all
because
i
thought
myself
such
a
wise
fellow
because
resolved
to
live
more
prudently
than
other
men
of
my
kind
did
i
wanted
to
save
money
for
the
future
out
of
shillings
a
week
many
and
many
a
day
i
starved
myself
to
try
and
make
up
for
expenses
of
the
home
sidney
you
remember
that
man
we
once
went
to
hear
lecture
the
man
that
talked
of
nothing
but
the
thriftlessness
of
the
poor
and
how
it
was
their
own
fault
they
suffered
i
was
very
near
telling
you
my
story
when
we
came
away
that
night
why
look
i
myself
was
just
the
kind
of
poor
man
that
would
have
suited
that
lecturer
and
what
came
of
it
if
i
let
my
poor
jenny
go
her
own
way
from
the
first
we
should
have
had
hard
times
now
and
then
but
there
have
been
our
love
to
help
us
and
we
should
have
been
happy
enough
they
talk
about
thriftiness
and
it
just
means
that
poor
people
are
expected
to
practise
a
that
the
rich
ca
even
imagine
much
less
carry
out
you
know
now
why
this
kind
of
talk
always
angers
me
michael
brooded
for
a
few
moments
his
eyes
straying
sadly
over
the
landscape
before
him
was
punished
he
continued
in
the
fittest
way
the
two
of
my
boys
who
showed
most
love
for
me
edward
and
robert
died
young
the
eldest
and
youngest
were
a
constant
trouble
to
me
michael
was
and
like
myself
i
took
the
wrong
way
with
him
just
like
i
had
with
his
mother
and
there
was
no
peace
till
he
left
home
joseph
was
still
harder
to
deal
with
but
he
the
only
one
left
alive
and
there
is
no
need
to
bring
up
things
against
him
with
him
i
was
to
blame
unless
i
treated
him
too
kindly
and
spoilt
him
he
was
my
favourite
was
jo
and
he
repaid
me
cruelly
when
he
married
i
only
heard
of
it
from
other
people
we
been
parted
for
a
long
time
already
and
just
about
then
i
had
a
letter
from
michael
asking
me
if
i
was
willing
to
go
out
and
live
with
him
in
australia
i
had
heard
from
him
more
than
two
or
three
times
in
twelve
years
and
when
this
letter
came
to
me
i
was
living
in
sheffield
i
been
there
about
five
years
he
wrote
to
say
he
was
doing
well
and
that
he
did
like
to
think
of
me
being
left
to
spend
my
old
age
alone
it
was
a
kind
letter
and
it
warmed
my
heart
lonely
i
was
as
lonely
and
sorrowful
a
man
as
any
in
england
i
wrote
back
to
say
that
i
come
to
him
gladly
if
he
could
promise
to
put
me
in
the
way
of
earning
my
own
living
he
agreed
to
that
and
i
left
the
old
country
little
thinking
i
should
ever
see
it
again
i
did
see
joseph
before
i
went
all
i
knew
of
him
was
that
he
lived
in
clerkenwell
close
married
and
that
was
all
i
had
to
guide
me
when
i
tried
to
find
him
a
few
years
after
i
was
bitter
against
him
and
went
without
trying
to
say
son
fortune
seems
to
have
been
made
chiefly
out
of
and
what
they
call
buying
over
the
heads
of
squatters
to
be
bought
out
again
at
a
high
profit
well
you
know
what
my
opinion
is
of
trading
at
the
best
and
as
far
as
i
could
understand
it
it
was
trading
at
about
its
worst
that
had
filled
pockets
he
had
a
partner
for
a
time
and
very
ugly
stories
were
told
me
about
the
man
however
michael
gave
me
as
kind
a
welcome
as
his
letter
promised
prosperity
had
done
him
good
and
he
seemed
only
anxious
to
make
up
for
the
years
of
unkindness
that
had
gone
by
had
i
been
willing
i
might
have
lived
under
his
roof
at
my
ease
but
i
held
him
to
his
bargain
and
worked
like
any
other
man
who
goes
there
without
money
it
a
comfort
to
me
to
think
of
those
few
years
spent
in
quiet
and
goodwill
with
my
eldest
boy
his
own
lad
would
have
given
trouble
i
afraid
if
he
lived
michael
used
to
talk
to
me
uneasily
about
him
poor
fellow
but
they
both
came
to
their
end
before
the
world
had
parted
them
i
been
a
young
man
i
dare
say
i
should
have
felt
different
when
they
told
me
how
rich
i
was
it
gave
me
no
pleasure
at
first
and
when
i
had
time
to
think
about
it
i
only
grew
worried
i
even
thought
once
or
twice
of
getting
rid
of
the
burden
by
giving
all
the
money
to
a
hospital
in
sydney
or
melbourne
but
then
i
remembered
that
the
poor
in
the
old
country
had
more
claim
on
me
and
when
i
got
used
to
the
idea
of
being
a
wealthy
man
i
found
myself
recalling
all
sorts
of
fancies
and
wishes
that
used
to
come
into
my
head
when
i
was
working
hard
for
a
poor
living
it
took
some
time
to
get
all
the
lawyer
business
finished
and
by
when
it
was
done
i
began
to
see
a
way
before
me
first
of
all
i
must
find
my
son
in
england
and
see
if
he
needed
help
i
had
made
any
change
in
my
way
of
living
and
i
came
back
from
australia
as
a
steerage
passenger
wearing
the
same
clothes
that
worked
in
the
lawyer
laughed
at
me
but
i
sure
i
should
have
laughed
at
myself
if
i
dressed
up
as
a
gentleman
and
begun
to
play
the
fool
in
my
old
age
the
money
was
to
be
used
in
that
way
i
got
my
ideas
and
they
grew
clearer
during
the
voyage
home
know
how
i
found
jane
not
long
after
i
put
an
advertisement
in
the
papers
asking
my
son
if
he
saw
it
to
communicate
with
percival
that
the
lawyer
i
was
recommended
to
in
london
there
was
no
answer
joseph
was
in
america
at
that
time
i
had
much
reason
to
like
peckover
and
her
daughter
but
i
kept
up
acquaintance
with
them
because
i
thought
they
might
hear
of
jo
some
day
and
after
a
while
i
sent
jane
to
learn
a
business
do
you
know
why
i
did
that
can
you
think
why
i
brought
up
the
child
as
if
i
only
had
just
enough
to
keep
us
both
and
never
gave
a
sign
that
i
could
have
made
a
rich
lady
of
her
in
asking
the
question
he
bent
forward
and
laid
his
hand
on
shoulder
his
eyes
gleamed
with
that
light
which
betrays
the
enthusiast
the
idealist
as
he
approached
the
explanation
to
which
his
story
had
tended
the
signs
of
age
and
weakness
disappeared
before
the
intensity
of
his
feeling
sidney
understood
now
why
he
had
always
been
conscious
of
something
in
the
man
mind
that
was
not
revealed
to
him
of
a
purpose
but
vaguely
indicated
by
the
general
tenor
of
michael
opinions
the
latter
fervour
affected
him
and
he
replied
with
emotion
wish
jane
to
think
of
this
money
as
you
do
yourself
not
to
regard
it
as
wealth
but
as
the
means
of
bringing
help
to
the
miserable
is
my
thought
sidney
it
came
to
me
in
that
form
whilst
i
was
sitting
by
her
bed
when
she
was
ill
at
peckover
i
knew
nothing
of
her
character
then
and
the
idea
i
had
might
have
come
to
nothing
through
her
turning
out
untrustworthy
but
i
thought
to
myself
suppose
she
grows
up
to
be
a
good
woman
suppose
i
can
teach
her
to
look
at
things
in
the
same
way
as
i
do
myself
train
her
to
feel
that
no
happiness
could
be
greater
than
the
power
to
put
an
end
to
ever
so
little
of
the
want
and
wretchedness
about
her
suppose
when
i
die
i
could
have
the
certainty
that
all
this
money
was
going
to
be
used
for
the
good
of
the
poor
by
a
woman
who
herself
belonged
to
the
poor
you
understand
me
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
leave
it
among
charities
in
the
ordinary
way
but
my
idea
went
beyond
that
i
might
have
had
jane
schooled
and
fashioned
into
a
lady
and
still
have
hoped
that
she
would
use
the
money
well
but
my
idea
went
beyond
there
plenty
of
ladies
nowadays
taking
an
interest
in
the
miserable
and
spending
their
means
unselfishly
what
i
hoped
was
to
raise
up
for
the
poor
and
the
untaught
a
friend
out
of
their
own
midst
some
one
who
had
gone
through
all
that
they
who
was
accustomed
to
earn
her
own
living
by
the
work
of
her
hands
as
do
who
had
never
thought
herself
their
better
who
saw
the
world
as
they
see
it
and
knew
all
their
wants
a
lady
may
do
good
we
know
that
but
she
ca
be
the
friend
of
the
poor
as
i
understand
it
there
too
great
a
distance
between
her
world
and
theirs
can
you
picture
to
yourself
how
anxiously
i
watched
this
child
from
the
first
day
she
came
to
live
with
me
i
scarcely
had
a
thought
but
about
her
i
saw
very
soon
that
she
had
good
feelings
and
i
set
myself
to
encourage
them
i
wanted
her
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
but
there
was
no
need
of
any
more
education
than
that
it
was
the
heart
i
cared
about
not
the
mind
besides
i
had
always
to
keep
saying
to
myself
that
perhaps
after
all
she
turn
out
the
kind
of
woman
i
wished
and
in
that
case
she
must
be
spoiled
for
an
ordinary
life
sidney
it
this
money
that
has
made
me
a
weak
old
man
when
i
might
still
have
been
as
strong
as
many
at
fifty
the
care
of
it
has
worn
me
out
i
have
slept
quietly
since
it
came
into
my
hands
but
the
worst
is
over
i
sha
be
disappointed
jane
will
be
the
woman
i
hoped
for
and
however
soon
my
own
life
comes
to
an
end
i
shall
die
knowing
that
there
a
true
man
by
her
side
to
help
her
to
make
my
idea
a
reality
mentioned
percival
the
lawyer
he
an
old
man
like
myself
and
we
had
many
a
long
talk
together
about
a
year
and
a
half
ago
i
told
him
what
i
told
you
now
since
i
came
back
to
england
he
been
managing
the
money
for
me
he
paid
me
the
little
we
needed
and
the
rest
of
the
income
has
been
used
in
charity
by
some
people
we
could
trust
well
percival
does
go
with
me
in
my
plans
for
jane
he
thinks
i
making
a
mistake
that
i
ought
to
have
had
the
child
educated
to
fit
her
to
live
with
rich
people
it
no
use
i
ca
get
him
to
feel
what
a
grand
thing
it
be
for
jane
to
go
about
among
her
own
people
and
help
them
as
nobody
ever
could
he
said
to
me
not
long
ago
and
is
the
girl
ever
to
have
a
husband
it
my
hope
that
she
will
i
told
him
and
do
you
suppose
he
went
on
that
whoever
marries
her
will
let
her
live
in
the
way
you
talk
of
where
are
you
going
to
find
a
working
man
that
be
content
never
to
touch
this
money
to
work
on
for
his
weekly
wages
when
he
might
be
living
at
his
ease
and
i
told
him
that
it
was
as
impossible
as
he
thought
what
do
you
think
sidney
the
communication
of
a
noble
idea
has
the
same
effect
upon
the
brains
of
certain
men
of
one
let
us
say
in
every
hundred
thousand
as
a
wine
that
exalts
and
enraptures
as
sidney
listened
to
the
old
man
telling
of
his
wondrous
vision
he
became
possessed
with
ardour
such
as
he
had
known
but
once
or
twice
in
his
life
idealism
such
as
michael
snowdon
had
developed
in
these
latter
years
is
a
form
of
genius
given
the
susceptible
hearer
it
dazzles
inspires
raises
to
heroic
contempt
of
the
facts
of
life
had
this
story
been
related
to
him
of
some
unknown
person
sidney
would
have
admired
but
as
one
admires
the
nobly
impracticable
subject
to
the
electric
influence
of
a
man
who
was
great
enough
to
conceive
and
direct
his
life
by
such
a
project
who
could
repose
so
supreme
a
faith
in
those
he
loved
all
the
primitive
nobleness
of
his
character
asserted
itself
and
he
could
accept
with
a
throbbing
heart
the
superb
challenge
addressed
to
him
jane
can
think
me
worthy
to
be
her
husband
he
replied
friend
shall
see
that
he
has
feared
without
cause
knew
it
sidney
i
knew
it
exclaimed
the
old
man
much
younger
i
feel
now
that
i
have
shared
this
burden
with
you
shall
you
now
tell
jane
the
other
inquired
yet
not
just
yet
she
is
very
young
we
must
wait
a
little
but
there
can
be
no
reason
why
you
should
speak
to
her
of
yourself
sidney
was
descending
from
the
clouds
as
the
flush
of
his
humanitarian
enthusiasm
passed
away
and
he
thought
of
his
personal
relations
to
jane
a
misgiving
a
scruple
began
to
make
itself
heard
within
him
worldly
and
commonplace
the
thought
but
had
he
a
right
to
ask
the
girl
to
pledge
herself
to
him
under
circumstances
such
as
these
to
be
sure
it
was
not
as
if
jane
were
an
heiress
in
the
ordinary
way
for
all
that
would
it
not
be
a
proceeding
of
doubtful
justice
to
woo
her
when
as
yet
she
was
wholly
ignorant
of
the
most
important
item
in
her
situation
his
sincerity
was
unassailable
but
suppose
in
fact
he
had
to
judge
the
conduct
of
another
man
thus
placed
upon
the
heated
pulsing
of
his
blood
succeeded
a
coolness
almost
a
chill
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
on
the
verge
of
a
precipice
and
had
been
warned
to
draw
back
only
just
in
time
every
second
showed
him
more
distinctly
what
his
duty
was
he
experienced
a
sensation
of
thankfulness
that
he
had
not
spoken
definitely
on
saturday
evening
his
instinct
had
guided
him
aright
jane
was
still
too
young
to
be
called
upon
solemnly
to
decide
her
whole
future
too
had
better
wait
snowdon
he
said
after
a
pause
of
a
minute
should
like
her
to
know
everything
before
i
speak
to
her
in
that
way
in
a
year
it
will
be
time
enough
michael
regarded
him
thoughtfully
you
are
right
i
wish
you
knew
percival
but
there
is
time
there
is
time
he
still
thinks
i
shall
be
persuaded
to
alter
my
plans
that
night
you
came
to
hanover
street
and
found
me
away
he
took
me
to
see
a
lady
who
works
among
the
poor
in
clerkenwell
she
knew
me
by
name
because
percival
had
given
her
money
from
me
to
use
but
we
never
seen
each
other
till
then
he
wants
me
to
ask
her
opinion
about
jane
he
spoken
of
her
to
the
lady
do
you
think
no
replied
the
other
with
perfect
confidence
has
promised
me
to
keep
all
that
a
secret
as
long
as
i
wish
the
lady
her
name
is
miss
lant
seemed
all
that
my
friend
said
she
was
and
perhaps
jane
might
do
well
to
make
her
acquaintance
some
day
but
that
must
be
till
jane
knows
and
approves
the
purpose
of
my
life
and
hers
the
one
thing
that
troubles
me
still
sidney
is
her
father
it
hard
that
i
ca
be
sure
whether
my
son
will
be
a
help
or
a
hindrance
i
must
wait
and
try
to
know
him
better
the
conversation
had
so
wearied
michael
that
in
returning
to
the
house
he
had
to
lean
on
his
companion
arm
sidney
was
silent
and
yielded
he
scarce
knew
why
to
a
mood
of
depression
when
jane
returned
from
maldon
in
the
evening
and
he
heard
her
happy
voice
as
the
children
ran
out
to
welcome
her
there
was
a
heaviness
at
his
heart
perhaps
it
came
only
of
hope

for

sidney
kirkwood
spending
his
sunday
evening
in
a
garden
away
there
in
the
regions
of
essex
where
it
was
so
deadly
quiet
that
you
could
hear
the
flutter
of
a
bird
wing
or
the
rustle
of
a
leaf
not
once
only
congratulated
himself
on
his
good
fortune
yet
at
that
hour
he
might
have
stood
as
so
often
listening
to
the
eloquence
the
wit
the
wisdom
that
give
proud
distinction
to
the
name
of
clerkenwell
green
towards
sundown
that
modern
agora
rang
with
the
voices
of
orators
swarmed
with
listeners
with
disputants
with
mockers
with
indifferent
loungers
the
circle
closing
about
an
agnostic
lecturer
intersected
with
one
gathered
for
a
the
roar
of
an
enthusiastic
blended
with
the
shriek
of
a
radical
politician
innumerable
were
the
little
groups
which
had
broken
away
from
the
larger
ones
to
hold
debate
on
matters
which
demanded
calm
consideration
and
the
finer
intellect
from
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
to
the
question
of
cabbage
beef
from
to
the
grievance
of
compulsory
vaccination
not
a
subject
which
modernism
has
thrown
out
to
the
multitude
but
here
received
its
sufficient
mauling
above
the
crowd
floated
wreaths
of
rank
tobacco
smoke
straying
from
circle
to
circle
might
have
been
seen
joseph
snowdon
the
baldness
of
his
crown
hidden
by
a
most
respectable
silk
hat
on
one
hand
a
glove
in
the
other
his
a
yellow
waistcoat
enhancing
his
appearance
of
dignity
a
white
necktie
spotted
with
blue
and
a
geranium
in
his
correcting
the
suspicion
of
age
suggested
by
his
countenance
as
a
listener
to
harangues
of
the
most
various
tendency
snowdon
exhibited
an
impartial
spirit
he
smiled
occasionally
but
was
never
moved
to
any
expression
of
stronger
feeling
his
placid
front
revealed
the
philosopher
yet
at
length
something
stirred
him
to
a
more
pronounced
interest
he
was
on
the
edge
of
a
dense
throng
which
had
just
been
delighted
by
the
rhetoric
of
a
clerkenwell
radical
the
topic
under
discussion
was
bent
and
the
last
speaker
had
in
truth
put
before
them
certain
noteworthy
views
of
the
subject
as
it
affected
the
poor
of
london
what
attracted
snowdon
attention
was
the
voice
of
the
speaker
who
next
rose
pressing
a
little
nearer
he
got
a
glimpse
of
a
lean
haggard
man
shabbily
dressed
no
bad
example
of
a
sufferer
from
the
hardships
he
was
beginning
to
denounce
old
hewett
remarked
somebody
close
by
the
feller
to
let
it
yes
it
was
john
hewett
much
older
much
more
broken
yet
much
fiercer
than
when
we
last
saw
him
though
it
was
evident
that
he
spoke
often
at
these
meetings
he
had
no
command
of
his
voice
and
no
coherence
of
style
after
the
first
few
words
he
seemed
to
be
overcome
by
rage
that
was
little
short
of
frenzy
inarticulate
screams
and
yells
interrupted
the
torrent
of
his
invective
he
raised
both
hands
above
his
head
and
clenched
them
in
a
gesture
of
frantic
passion
his
visage
was
frightfully
distorted
and
in
a
few
minutes
there
actually
fell
drops
of
blood
from
his
bitten
lip
rent
it
was
a
subject
on
which
the
poor
fellow
could
speak
to
some
purpose
what
was
the
root
of
the
difficulty
a
london
workman
found
in
making
both
ends
meet
was
it
that
accursed
law
by
which
the
owner
of
property
can
make
him
pay
a
half
and
often
more
of
his
earnings
or
permission
to
put
his
wife
and
children
under
a
roof
and
what
sort
of
dwellings
were
they
these
in
which
the
men
who
made
the
wealth
of
the
country
were
born
and
lived
and
died
what
would
happen
to
the
landlords
of
clerkenwell
if
they
got
their
due
ay
what
happen
my
boys
and
that
before
so
very
long
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
john
expended
his
fury
until
in
fact
he
was
speechless
it
was
terrible
to
look
at
him
when
at
length
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
his
face
was
livid
his
eyes
bloodshot
a
red
slaver
covered
his
lips
and
beard
you
might
have
taken
him
for
a
drunken
man
so
feebly
did
his
limbs
support
him
so
shattered
was
he
by
the
fit
through
which
he
had
passed
joseph
followed
him
and
presently
walked
along
at
his
side
was
about
as
good
a
speech
as
i
heard
for
a
long
time
hewett
he
began
by
observing
like
to
hear
a
man
speak
as
if
he
meant
it
john
looked
up
with
a
leaden
rheumy
eye
but
the
compliment
pleased
him
and
in
a
moment
he
smiled
vacantly
have
said
my
last
word
yet
he
replied
with
difficulty
making
himself
audible
through
his
hoarseness
takes
it
out
of
you
i
afraid
suppose
we
have
a
drop
of
something
at
the
corner
here
do
mind
snowdon
i
thought
of
looking
in
at
my
club
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
perhaps
you
come
round
with
me
afterwards
they
drank
at
the
then
hewett
led
the
way
by
back
streets
to
the
quarters
of
the
club
of
which
he
had
been
for
many
years
a
member
the
locality
was
not
cheerful
and
the
house
itself
stood
in
much
need
of
repair
as
they
entered
john
requested
his
companion
to
sign
his
name
in
the
visitors
book
snowdon
did
so
with
a
flourish
they
ascended
to
the
first
floor
and
passed
into
a
room
where
little
could
be
seen
but
the
and
those
dimly
owing
to
the
fume
of
pipes
the
rattle
of
bones
the
strumming
of
a
banjo
and
a
voice
raised
at
intervals
in
a
kind
of
whoop
announced
that
a
nigger
entertainment
was
in
progress
recreation
of
this
kind
is
not
uncommon
on
sunday
evening
at
the
workmen
clubs
you
will
find
it
announced
in
the
remarkable
list
of
lectures
printed
in
certain
sunday
newspapers
the
company
which
was
exerting
itself
in
the
present
instance
had
at
all
events
an
appreciative
audience
laughter
and
applause
broke
forth
very
frequently
forgot
it
was
this
kind
o
thing
said
hewett
when
he
could
discover
no
vacant
seat
you
care
about
it
no
more
do
i
let
go
down
into
the
downstairs
they
established
themselves
at
their
ease
john
ordered
two
of
ale
the
club
supplied
refreshment
for
the
body
as
well
as
for
the
mind
and
presently
he
was
more
himself
your
wife
inquired
joseph
i
hope
wish
i
could
say
so
answered
the
other
shaking
his
head
has
been
up
since
thursday
she
bad
poor
woman
she
bad
joseph
murmured
his
sympathy
between
two
draughts
of
ale
young
kirkwood
lately
hewett
asked
averting
his
eyes
and
assuming
a
tone
of
indifference
gone
away
for
his
holiday
gone
into
essex
somewhere
when
was
it
he
was
speaking
of
you
why
one
day
last
week
to
be
sure
about
me
eh
said
john
turning
his
glass
round
and
round
on
the
table
and
as
the
other
remained
silent
he
added
can
tell
him
if
you
like
that
my
wife
been
very
bad
for
a
long
time
him
me
do
have
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
but
you
can
tell
him
that
if
you
like
i
will
replied
snowdon
nodding
with
a
confidential
air
he
had
noticed
from
the
beginning
of
his
acquaintance
with
hewett
that
the
latter
showed
no
disinclination
to
receive
news
of
kirkwood
as
clem
husband
joseph
was
understood
to
be
perfectly
aware
of
the
state
of
things
between
the
hewetts
and
their
former
friend
and
in
a
recent
conversation
with
hewett
he
had
assured
himself
that
she
at
all
events
would
be
glad
if
the
estrangement
could
come
to
an
end
for
reasons
of
his
own
joseph
gave
narrow
attention
to
these
signs
the
talk
was
turning
to
other
matters
when
a
man
who
had
just
entered
the
room
and
stood
looking
about
him
with
an
uneasy
expression
caught
sight
of
hewett
and
approached
him
he
was
coarse
of
feature
clad
in
the
creased
black
which
a
certain
type
of
artisan
wears
on
sunday
like
a
word
with
you
john
he
said
your
friend
excuse
hewett
rose
from
the
table
and
they
walked
together
to
an
unoccupied
spot
you
heard
any
talk
about
the
burial
club
inquired
the
man
in
a
low
voice
of
suspicion
knitting
his
eyebrows
anything
no
what
dick
smales
says
he
ca
get
the
money
for
his
boy
as
died
last
week
get
it
why
not
just
what
i
want
to
know
some
o
the
chaps
is
talkin
about
it
upstairs
ai
been
seen
for
four
or
five
days
somebody
had
news
as
he
was
ill
in
bed
and
now
there
no
findin
him
i
got
a
notion
there
something
wrong
my
boy
hewett
eyes
grew
large
and
the
muscles
of
his
mouth
contracted
jenkins
he
asked
abruptly
suppose
he
can
explain
it
by
god
he
ca
he
wo
say
nothing
but
he
been
about
all
yesterday
and
lookin
precious
queer
without
paying
any
further
attention
to
snowdon
john
left
the
room
with
his
companion
and
they
went
upstairs
most
of
the
men
present
were
members
of
the
burial
club
in
question
an
institution
of
some
fifteen
years
standing
and
in
connection
with
the
club
which
met
here
for
social
and
political
purposes
they
were
in
the
habit
like
john
hewett
of
depositing
their
coppers
weekly
thus
insuring
themselves
or
their
relatives
for
a
sum
payable
at
death
the
rumour
that
something
was
wrong
that
the
secretary
could
not
be
found
began
to
create
a
disturbance
presently
the
nigger
entertainment
came
to
an
end
and
the
burial
club
was
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
on
the
morrow
it
was
an
ascertained
fact
that
one
of
the
catastrophes
which
occasionally
befall
the
provident
among
had
come
to
pass
investigation
showed
that
for
a
long
time
there
had
been
carelessness
and
mismanagement
of
funds
and
that
fraud
had
completed
the
disaster
was
wanted
by
the
police
to
john
hewett
the
blow
was
a
terrible
one
in
spite
of
his
poverty
he
had
never
fallen
behind
with
those
weekly
payments
the
thing
he
dreaded
supremely
was
that
his
wife
or
one
of
the
children
should
die
and
he
be
unable
to
provide
a
decent
burial
at
the
death
of
the
last
child
born
to
him
the
club
had
of
course
paid
and
the
confidence
he
felt
in
it
for
the
future
was
a
sensible
support
under
the
many
miseries
of
his
life
a
support
of
which
no
idea
can
be
formed
by
one
who
has
never
foreseen
the
possibility
of
those
dear
to
him
being
carried
to
a
pauper
grave
it
was
a
touching
fact
that
he
still
kept
up
the
payment
for
clara
who
could
say
but
his
daughter
might
yet
come
back
to
him
to
die
to
know
that
he
had
lost
that
one
stronghold
against
fate
was
a
stroke
that
left
him
scarcely
strength
to
go
about
his
daily
work
and
he
could
not
breathe
a
word
of
it
to
his
wife
oh
that
better
curse
of
poverty
which
puts
corrupting
poison
into
the
wounds
inflicted
by
nature
which
outrages
the
spirit
tenderness
which
profanes
with
unutterable
defilement
the
secret
places
of
the
mourning
heart
he
could
not
durst
not
speak
a
word
of
this
misery
to
her
whose
gratitude
and
love
had
resisted
every
trial
who
had
shared
uncomplainingly
all
the
evil
of
his
lot
and
had
borne
with
supreme
patience
those
added
sufferings
of
which
he
had
no
conception
for
she
lay
on
her
deathbed
the
doctor
told
him
so
on
the
very
day
when
he
learnt
that
it
would
be
out
of
his
power
to
discharge
the
fitting
pieties
at
her
grave
so
far
from
looking
to
her
for
sympathy
it
behoved
him
to
keep
from
her
as
much
as
a
suspicion
of
what
had
happened
their
home
at
this
time
was
a
kitchen
in
king
cross
road
the
eldest
child
amy
was
now
between
ten
and
eleven
annie
was
nine
tom
seven
these
of
course
went
to
school
every
day
and
were
being
taught
to
appreciate
the
woefulness
of
their
inheritance
amy
was
on
the
whole
a
good
girl
she
could
make
purchases
as
well
as
her
mother
and
when
in
the
mood
look
carefully
after
her
little
brother
and
sister
but
already
she
had
begun
to
display
restiveness
under
the
hard
discipline
to
which
the
domestic
poverty
subjected
her
once
she
had
played
truant
from
school
and
told
falsehoods
to
the
teachers
to
explain
her
absence
it
was
discovered
that
she
had
been
tempted
by
other
girls
to
go
and
see
the
lord
mayor
show
annie
and
tom
threatened
to
be
troublesome
when
they
got
a
little
older
the
boy
could
not
be
taught
to
speak
the
truth
and
his
sister
was
constantly
committing
petty
thefts
of
jam
sugar
even
coppers
and
during
the
past
year
their
mother
was
seldom
able
to
exert
herself
in
correcting
these
faults
only
by
dint
of
struggle
which
cost
her
agonies
could
she
discharge
the
simplest
duties
of
home
she
made
a
brave
fight
against
disease
and
penury
and
incessant
dread
of
the
coming
day
but
month
after
month
her
strength
failed
now
at
length
she
tried
vainly
to
leave
her
bed
the
last
reserve
of
energy
was
exhausted
and
the
end
near
after
her
death
what
then
through
the
nights
of
this
week
after
her
doom
had
been
spoken
she
lay
questioning
the
future
she
knew
that
but
for
her
unremitting
efforts
hewett
would
have
yielded
to
the
despair
of
a
drunkard
the
crucial
moment
was
when
he
found
himself
forsaken
by
his
daughter
and
no
one
but
this
poor
woman
could
know
what
force
of
loving
will
what
entreaties
what
tears
had
drawn
him
back
a
little
way
from
the
edge
of
the
gulf
throughout
his
life
until
that
day
of
clara
disappearance
he
had
seemed
in
no
danger
from
the
deadliest
enemy
of
the
poor
one
taste
of
the
oblivion
that
could
be
bought
at
any
and
it
was
as
though
drinking
had
been
a
recognised
habit
with
him
a
year
two
years
and
he
still
drank
himself
into
forgetfulness
as
often
as
his
mental
suffering
waxed
unendurable
on
the
morrow
of
every
such
crime
interpret
the
word
rightly
he
hated
himself
for
his
cruelty
to
that
pale
sufferer
whose
reproaches
were
only
the
utterances
of
love
the
third
year
saw
an
improvement
whether
owing
to
conscious
or
to
the
fact
that
time
was
blunting
his
affliction
instead
of
the
he
frequented
all
places
where
the
woes
of
the
nether
world
found
fierce
expression
he
became
a
constant
speaker
at
the
meetings
on
clerkenwell
green
and
at
the
radical
clubs
the
effect
upon
him
of
this
excitement
was
evil
enough
yet
not
so
evil
as
the
malady
of
drink
hewett
was
thankful
for
the
alternative
but
when
she
was
no
longer
at
his
side
what
then
his
employment
was
irregular
but
for
the
most
part
at
the
workshop
where
he
was
generally
to
be
found
was
owned
by
two
brothers
who
invariably
spent
the
first
half
of
each
week
in
steady
drinking
their
money
gone
they
set
to
work
and
made
articles
of
furniture
which
on
saturday
they
took
round
to
the
shops
of
small
dealers
and
sold
for
what
they
could
get
when
once
they
took
up
their
tools
these
men
worked
with
incredible
persistency
and
they
expected
the
same
exertion
from
those
they
employed
would
give
a
for
the
chap
as
ca
do
his
hours
at
the
bench
remarked
one
of
them
on
the
occasion
of
a
workman
falling
into
a
caused
by
utter
exhaustion
hewett
was
anything
but
strong
and
he
earned
little
late
on
saturday
afternoon
sidney
kirkwood
and
his
friends
were
back
in
london
as
he
drew
near
to
tysoe
street
carrying
the
bag
which
was
all
the
luggage
he
had
needed
sidney
by
chance
encountered
joseph
snowdon
who
after
inquiring
about
his
relatives
said
that
he
had
just
come
from
visiting
the
hewetts
hewett
was
very
ill
indeed
and
it
was
scarcely
to
be
expected
she
would
live
more
than
a
few
days
mean
that
exclaimed
kirkwood
upon
whom
after
his
week
of
holiday
and
of
mental
experiences
which
seemed
to
have
changed
the
face
of
the
world
for
him
this
sudden
announcement
came
with
a
painful
shock
reviving
all
the
miserable
past
is
dying
no
doubt
of
it
and
joseph
added
his
belief
that
john
hewett
would
certainly
not
take
it
ill
if
the
other
went
there
before
it
was
too
late
sidney
had
no
appetite
now
for
the
meal
he
would
have
purchased
on
reaching
home
a
profound
pity
for
the
poor
woman
who
had
given
him
so
many
proofs
of
her
affection
made
his
heart
heavy
almost
to
tears
the
perplexities
of
the
present
vanished
in
a
revival
of
old
tenderness
of
bygone
sympathies
and
sorrows
he
could
not
doubt
but
that
it
was
his
duty
to
go
to
his
former
friends
at
a
time
such
as
this
perhaps
if
he
had
overcome
his
pride
he
might
have
sooner
brought
the
estrangement
to
an
end
he
did
not
know
and
had
forgotten
to
ask
of
snowdon
the
number
of
the
house
in
king
cross
road
where
the
hewetts
lived
he
could
find
it
however
by
visiting
pennyloaf
conquering
his
hesitation
he
was
on
the
point
of
going
forth
when
his
landlady
came
up
and
told
him
that
a
young
girl
wished
to
see
him
it
was
amy
hewett
and
her
face
told
him
on
what
errand
she
had
come
kirkwood
she
began
looking
up
with
embarrassment
for
he
was
all
but
a
stranger
to
her
now
wants
to
know
if
you
come
and
see
her
she
very
bad
they
afraid
she
the
word
was
choked
amy
had
been
crying
and
the
tears
again
rose
to
her
eyes
was
just
coming
sidney
answered
as
he
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
kindly
they
crossed
wilmington
square
and
descended
by
the
streets
that
slope
to
coldbath
fields
prison
the
cellar
in
which
john
hewett
and
his
family
were
housed
was
underneath
a
amy
led
the
way
down
stone
steps
from
the
pavement
of
the
street
into
an
area
where
more
than
two
people
would
have
had
difficulty
in
standing
together
sidney
saw
that
the
window
which
looked
upon
this
space
was
draped
with
a
sheet
by
an
open
door
they
entered
a
passage
then
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
amy
pushed
it
open
and
showed
that
a
lamp
gave
light
within
to
poor
homes
sidney
kirkwood
was
no
stranger
but
a
poorer
than
this
now
disclosed
to
him
he
had
never
seen
the
first
view
of
it
made
him
draw
in
his
breath
as
though
a
pang
went
through
him
hewett
was
not
here
the
two
younger
children
were
sitting
upon
a
mattress
eating
bread
amy
stepped
up
to
the
bedside
and
bent
to
examine
her
face
think
she
asleep
she
whispered
turning
round
to
sidney
sleep
or
loath
it
might
well
be
the
latter
for
anything
sidney
could
determine
to
the
contrary
the
face
he
could
not
recognise
or
only
when
he
had
gazed
at
it
for
several
minutes
oh
pitiless
world
that
pursues
its
business
and
its
pleasure
that
takes
its
fill
of
life
from
the
rising
to
the
going
down
of
the
sun
and
within
sound
of
its
clamour
is
this
of
anguish
and
desolation
here
mr
kirkwood
repeated
several
times
the
words
at
length
awoke
consciousness
the
dying
woman
could
not
move
her
head
from
the
pillow
her
eyes
wandered
but
in
the
end
rested
upon
sidney
he
saw
an
expression
of
surprise
of
anxiety
then
a
smile
of
deep
contentment
knew
you
come
i
did
so
want
to
see
you
do
go
just
yet
will
you
the
lump
in
his
throat
hindered
sidney
from
replying
hot
tears
an
agony
in
the
shedding
began
to
stream
down
his
cheeks
john
she
continued
trying
to
look
about
the
room
where
your
father
he
come
soon
sidney
i
want
you
and
him
to
be
friends
again
he
knows
he
never
ought
to
a
said
what
he
did
take
on
so
sidney
there
be
amy
to
look
after
the
others
she
be
a
good
girl
she
promised
me
it
john
i
afraid
for
if
only
he
can
keep
from
drink
will
you
try
and
help
him
sidney
there
was
a
terrible
earnestness
of
appeal
in
the
look
she
fixed
upon
him
sidney
replied
that
he
would
hold
nothing
more
sacred
than
the
charge
she
gave
him
be
easier
for
them
to
live
continued
the
feeble
voice
been
ill
so
long
and
there
been
so
much
expense
amy
be
earning
something
before
long
trouble
sidney
answered
shall
never
want
as
long
as
i
live
never
come
a
bit
nearer
do
you
know
anything
about
he
shook
his
head
ever
if
ever
she
comes
back
do
turn
away
from
her
will
you
would
welcome
her
as
i
would
a
sister
of
my
own
such
hard
things
in
a
woman
life
what
would
a
become
of
me
if
john
had
took
pity
on
me
the
world
a
hard
place
i
should
be
glad
to
leave
it
if
it
was
for
them
as
has
to
go
on
in
their
trouble
i
knew
you
come
when
i
sent
amy
oh
i
feel
that
easier
in
my
mind
did
you
send
long
before
no
it
my
fault
why
did
i
come
why
did
i
come
there
was
a
footstep
in
the
passage
a
slow
uncertain
step
then
the
door
moved
a
little
with
blurred
vision
sidney
saw
hewett
enter
and
come
forward
they
grasped
each
other
hands
without
speaking
and
john
as
though
his
strength
were
at
an
end
dropped
upon
the
chair
by
the
bedside
for
the
last
four
or
five
nights
he
had
sat
there
if
he
got
half
an
hour
painful
slumber
now
and
then
it
was
the
utmost
his
face
was
like
that
of
some
prisoner
whom
the
long
torture
of
a
foul
dungeon
has
brought
to
the
point
of
madness
he
uttered
only
a
few
words
during
the
that
sidney
still
remained
in
the
room
the
latter
when
hewett
relapse
into
unconsciousness
made
it
useless
for
him
to
stay
beckoned
amy
to
follow
him
out
into
the
area
and
put
money
in
her
hand
begging
her
to
get
whatever
was
needed
without
troubling
her
father
he
would
come
again
in
the
morning
hewett
died
just
before
daybreak
without
a
pang
as
though
death
had
compassion
on
her
when
sidney
came
about
nine
he
found
amy
standing
at
the
door
of
the
the
people
who
kept
it
had
brought
the
children
up
into
their
room
hewett
still
sat
by
the
bed
seeing
kirkwood
he
pointed
to
the
hidden
face
am
i
to
bury
her
he
whispered
hoarsely
you
heard
about
it
they
stole
the
they
robbed
me
of
it
i
have
as
much
as
pay
for
her
coffin
sidney
fancied
at
first
that
the
man
mind
was
wandering
but
hewett
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
scrap
of
newspaper
in
which
the
matter
was
briefly
reported
it
there
i
known
since
last
sunday
and
i
had
to
keep
it
from
her
no
need
to
be
afraid
of
speakin
now
they
robbed
me
and
i
have
as
much
as
pay
for
her
coffin
it
a
nice
blasted
world
this
is
where
they
wo
let
you
live
and
then
make
you
pay
if
you
do
want
to
be
buried
like
a
dog
she
had
nothing
but
pain
and
poverty
all
her
life
and
now
they
pitch
her
out
of
the
way
in
a
parish
box
do
you
remember
what
hopes
i
used
to
have
when
we
were
first
married
see
the
end
of
look
at
this
underground
hole
look
at
this
bed
as
she
lays
on
is
it
my
fault
by
god
i
wonder
i
killed
myself
before
this
i
been
drove
mad
i
tell
you
mad
well
if
i
do
do
murder
yet
every
man
as
i
see
go
by
with
a
good
coat
on
his
back
and
a
face
fat
with
good
feeding
it
all
i
can
do
to
keep
from
catchin
his
throat
an
tearin
the
life
out
of
him
talk
about
the
burial
interposed
sidney
your
mind
at
ease
i
got
enough
to
pay
for
all
that
and
you
must
let
me
lend
you
what
you
want
me
money
you
as
i
have
spoke
to
for
years
more
fault
mine
i
ought
to
have
come
back
again
long
since
you
would
have
refused
an
old
friend
that
never
meant
an
unkindness
to
you
it
was
me
as
was
to
blame
said
the
other
with
choking
voice
always
told
me
so
and
she
always
said
what
was
right
but
i
take
it
of
you
sidney
i
ca
lend
it
an
where
am
i
goin
to
get
it
from
to
pay
you
back
it
wo
be
so
long
before
i
lie
like
she
does
there
it
getting
too
much
for
me
the
first
tears
he
had
shed
rose
at
this
generosity
of
the
man
he
had
so
little
claim
upon
his
passionate
grief
and
the
spirit
of
rebellion
which
grew
more
frenzied
as
he
grew
older
were
subdued
to
a
sobbing
gratitude
for
the
kindness
which
visited
him
in
his
need
nerveless
voiceless
he
fell
back
again
upon
the
chair
and
let
his
head
lie
by
that
of
the
dead
woman
chapter
xxii
watching
from
ambush
joseph
snowdon
though
presenting
a
calm
countenance
to
the
world
and
seeming
to
enjoy
comparative
prosperity
was
in
truth
much
harassed
by
the
difficulties
of
his
position
domestic
troubles
he
had
anticipated
but
the
unforeseen
sequel
of
his
marriage
resulted
in
a
martyrdom
at
the
hands
of
clem
and
her
mother
such
as
he
had
never
dreamed
of
his
faults
and
weaknesses
distinctly
those
of
the
civilised
man
he
found
himself
in
disastrous
alliance
with
two
savages
whose
characters
so
supplemented
each
other
as
to
constitute
in
unison
a
formidable
engine
of
tyranny
clem
suspicious
revengeful
fierce
watching
with
cruel
eyes
every
opportunity
of
taking
payment
on
account
for
the
ridicule
to
which
she
had
exposed
herself
peckover
ceaselessly
occupied
with
the
basest
scheming
keen
as
an
indian
on
any
trail
she
happened
to
strike
excited
by
the
scent
of
money
as
a
jackal
by
that
of
carrion
for
this
pair
joseph
was
no
match
not
only
did
they
compel
him
to
earn
his
daily
bread
by
dint
of
methodical
effort
such
as
was
torture
to
his
indolent
disposition
but
moreover
in
pursuance
of
peckover
crafty
projects
he
was
constrained
to
an
assiduous
hypocrisy
in
his
relations
with
michael
and
jane
which
wearied
him
beyond
measure
joseph
did
not
belong
to
the
most
desperate
class
of
hungry
mortals
he
had
neither
the
large
ambitions
and
the
passionate
sensual
desires
which
make
life
an
unending
fever
nor
was
he
possessed
with
that
foul
itch
of
covetousness
which
is
the
explanation
of
the
greater
part
of
the
world
activity
he
understood
quite
sufficiently
the
advantages
of
wealth
and
was
prepared
to
go
considerable
lengths
for
the
sake
of
enjoying
them
but
his
character
lacked
persistence
this
defect
explained
the
rogueries
and
calamities
of
his
life
he
had
brains
in
abundance
and
a
somewhat
better
education
would
have
made
of
him
either
a
successful
honest
man
or
a
rascal
of
superior
scope
it
is
always
a
between
these
two
results
where
a
character
such
as
his
is
in
question
ever
since
he
abandoned
the
craft
to
which
his
father
had
had
him
trained
he
had
lived
on
his
wits
there
would
be
matter
for
a
volume
in
the
history
of
his
experiences
at
home
and
abroad
a
volume
infinitely
more
valuable
considered
as
a
treatise
on
modern
civilisation
than
any
professed
work
on
that
subject
in
existence
with
one
episode
only
in
his
past
can
we
here
concern
ourselves
the
retrospect
is
needful
to
make
clear
his
relations
with
scawthorne
on
his
return
from
america
joseph
possessed
a
matter
of
a
hundred
pounds
the
money
was
not
quite
legally
earned
pray
let
us
reserve
the
word
honesty
for
a
truer
use
than
the
common
one
and
on
the
whole
he
preferred
to
recommence
life
in
the
old
country
under
a
pseudonym
that
little
affair
of
the
desertion
of
his
child
would
perhaps
in
any
case
have
made
this
advisable
a
hundred
pounds
will
not
go
very
far
but
joseph
took
care
to
be
well
dressed
and
allowed
it
to
be
surmised
by
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
that
the
resources
at
his
command
were
considerable
in
early
days
as
we
know
he
had
worked
at
electroplating
and
the
natural
bent
of
his
intellect
was
towards
mechanical
and
physical
science
by
dint
of
experimenting
at
his
old
pursuit
he
persuaded
himself
or
at
all
events
attained
plausibility
for
the
persuading
of
others
that
he
had
discovered
a
new
and
valuable
method
of
plating
with
nickel
he
gave
it
out
that
he
was
in
search
of
a
partner
to
join
him
in
putting
this
method
into
practice
gentlemen
thus
situated
naturally
avail
themselves
of
the
advertisement
columns
of
the
newspaper
and
joseph
by
this
means
had
the
happiness
to
form
an
acquaintance
with
one
polkenhorne
who
like
himself
had
sundry
schemes
for
obtaining
money
without
toiling
for
it
in
the
usual
vulgar
way
polkenhorne
was
a
man
of
much
of
a
blackguard
but
handsome
and
tolerably
educated
the
son
of
a
clerkenwell
clockmaker
he
had
run
through
an
inheritance
of
a
few
thousand
pounds
and
made
no
secret
of
his
history
spoke
of
his
experiences
indeed
with
a
certain
pride
between
these
two
a
close
intimacy
sprang
up
one
of
those
partnerships
beginning
with
mutual
deception
which
are
so
common
in
the
of
enterprise
just
skirting
the
criminal
courts
polkenhorne
resided
at
this
time
in
kennington
he
was
married
or
said
that
he
was
to
a
young
lady
in
the
theatrical
profession
known
to
the
public
as
miss
grace
danver
to
polkenhorne
or
miss
danver
joseph
soon
had
the
honour
of
being
presented
for
she
was
just
then
playing
at
a
london
theatre
he
found
her
a
pretty
but
girl
not
at
all
likely
to
achieve
great
successes
earning
enough
however
to
support
polkenhorne
during
this
time
of
his
misfortunes
a
most
pleasant
and
natural
arrangement
polkenhorne
acquaintances
were
numerous
but
as
he
informed
joseph
most
of
them
were
out
that
is
to
say
no
further
use
could
be
made
of
them
from
polkenhorne
point
of
view
one
however
as
yet
imperfectly
known
promised
to
be
useful
perchance
as
a
victim
more
probably
as
an
ally
his
name
was
scawthorne
and
polkenhorne
had
come
across
him
in
consequence
of
a
friendship
existing
between
grace
danver
and
scawthorne
at
all
events
a
young
lady
thus
known
who
was
preparing
herself
for
the
stage
this
gentleman
was
in
the
city
he
had
rather
a
close
look
but
proved
genial
enough
and
was
very
ready
to
discuss
things
in
general
with
polkenhorne
and
his
capitalist
friend
camden
just
from
the
united
states
a
word
or
two
about
charles
henry
scawthorne
of
the
circumstances
which
made
him
what
you
know
or
what
you
conjecture
his
father
had
a
small
business
as
a
dyer
in
islington
and
the
boy
leaving
school
at
fourteen
was
sent
to
become
a
in
a
solicitor
office
his
tastes
were
so
strongly
intellectual
that
it
seemed
a
pity
to
put
him
to
work
he
hated
and
the
clerkship
was
the
best
opening
that
could
be
procured
for
him
two
years
after
scawthorne
died
his
wife
tried
to
keep
on
the
business
but
soon
failed
and
thenceforth
her
son
had
to
support
her
as
well
as
himself
from
sixteen
to
was
the
period
of
young
scawthorne
life
which
assured
his
future
advancement
and
his
moral
ruin
a
grave
gentle
somewhat
effeminate
boy
with
a
great
love
of
books
and
a
wonderful
power
of
application
to
study
he
suffered
so
much
during
those
years
of
early
maturity
that
as
in
almost
all
such
eases
his
nature
was
corrupted
pity
that
some
intellectual
man
of
our
time
has
not
flung
in
the
teeth
a
truthful
autobiography
scawthorne
worked
himself
up
to
a
position
which
had
at
first
seemed
unattainable
what
he
paid
for
the
success
was
loss
of
all
his
pure
ideals
of
his
sincerity
of
his
disinterestedness
of
the
fine
perceptions
to
which
he
was
born
probably
no
one
who
is
and
overworked
during
those
critical
years
comes
out
of
the
trial
with
his
moral
nature
uninjured
to
certain
characters
it
is
a
wrong
irreparable
to
stab
the
root
of
a
young
tree
to
hang
crushing
burdens
upon
it
to
rend
off
its
early
branches
that
is
not
the
treatment
likely
to
result
in
growth
such
as
nature
purposed
there
will
come
of
it
a
vicious
formation
and
the
principle
applies
also
to
the
youth
of
men
scawthorne
was
fond
of
the
theatre
as
soon
as
his
time
of
incessant
toll
was
over
he
not
only
attended
performances
frequently
but
managed
to
make
personal
acquaintance
with
sundry
theatrical
people
opportunity
for
this
was
afforded
by
his
becoming
member
of
a
club
consisting
chiefly
of
solicitors
clerks
which
was
frequently
honoured
by
visits
from
former
associates
who
had
taken
to
the
stage
these
happy
beings
would
condescend
to
recite
at
times
to
give
help
in
getting
up
a
dramatic
entertainment
and
soon
in
this
way
scawthorne
came
to
know
an
old
actor
named
drake
who
supported
himself
by
instructing
novices
male
and
female
in
his
own
profession
one
of
drake
old
pupils
was
miss
grace
danver
in
whom
as
soon
as
he
met
her
scawthorne
recognised
the
grace
rudd
of
earlier
days
and
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
he
brought
to
drake
a
young
girl
of
interesting
appearance
but
very
imperfect
education
who
fancied
she
had
a
turn
for
acting
he
succeeded
in
arranging
for
her
instruction
and
a
year
and
a
half
later
she
obtained
her
first
engagement
at
a
theatre
in
scotland
the
name
she
adopted
was
clara
vale
joseph
snowdon
saw
her
once
or
twice
before
she
left
london
and
from
grace
danver
he
heard
that
grace
and
she
had
been
schoolfellows
in
clerkenwell
these
facts
revived
in
his
memory
when
he
afterwards
heard
clem
speak
of
clara
hewett
nothing
came
of
the
alliance
between
polkenhorne
and
joseph
when
the
latter
money
was
exhausted
they
naturally
fell
apart
joseph
made
a
living
in
sundry
precarious
ways
but
at
length
sank
into
such
straits
that
he
risked
the
step
of
going
to
clerkenwell
close
personal
interest
in
his
child
he
had
then
none
whatever
his
short
married
life
seemed
an
episode
in
the
remote
past
recalled
with
indifference
but
in
spite
of
his
profound
selfishness
it
was
not
solely
from
the
speculative
point
of
view
that
he
regarded
jane
when
he
had
had
time
to
realise
that
she
was
his
daughter
and
in
a
measure
to
appreciate
her
character
with
the
merely
base
motives
which
led
him
to
seek
her
affection
and
put
him
at
secret
hostility
with
sidney
kirkwood
there
mingled
before
long
a
strain
of
feeling
which
was
natural
and
pure
he
became
a
little
jealous
of
his
father
and
of
sidney
on
other
grounds
than
those
of
intolerable
as
his
home
was
no
wonder
that
he
found
it
a
pleasant
relief
to
spend
an
evening
in
hanover
street
he
never
came
away
without
railing
at
himself
for
his
imbecility
in
having
married
clem
for
the
present
he
had
to
plot
with
his
wife
and
peckover
but
only
let
the
chance
for
plotting
them
offer
itself
the
opportunity
might
come
in
the
meantime
the
great
thing
was
to
postpone
the
marriage
he
had
no
doubt
it
was
contemplated
between
jane
and
sidney
that
would
be
little
less
than
a
fatality
the
week
that
jane
spent
in
essex
was
of
course
a
time
of
desperate
anxiety
with
joseph
immediately
on
her
return
he
hastened
to
assure
himself
that
things
remained
as
before
it
seemed
to
him
that
greeting
had
more
warmth
than
she
was
wont
to
display
when
they
met
sundry
other
little
changes
in
her
demeanour
struck
him
at
the
same
interview
and
he
was
rather
surprised
that
she
had
not
so
much
blitheness
as
before
she
went
away
but
his
speculation
on
minutiae
such
as
these
was
suddenly
interrupted
a
day
or
two
later
by
news
which
threw
him
into
a
state
of
excitement
jane
sent
word
that
her
grandfather
was
very
unwell
that
he
appeared
to
have
caught
a
chill
in
the
journey
home
and
could
not
at
present
leave
his
bed
for
a
week
the
old
man
suffered
from
feverish
symptoms
and
though
he
threw
off
the
ailment
it
was
in
a
state
of
much
feebleness
that
he
at
length
resumed
the
ordinary
tenor
of
his
way
jane
had
of
course
stayed
at
home
to
nurse
him
a
fortnight
a
month
passed
and
michael
still
kept
her
from
work
then
it
happened
that
on
joseph
looking
in
one
evening
the
old
man
said
quietly
think
i
rather
jane
stayed
at
home
in
future
we
had
a
long
talk
about
it
this
afternoon
joseph
glanced
at
his
daughter
who
met
the
look
very
gravely
he
had
a
feeling
that
the
girl
was
of
a
sudden
grown
older
when
she
spoke
it
was
in
brief
phrases
and
with
but
little
of
her
natural
spontaneity
noiseless
as
always
in
her
movements
she
walked
with
a
staider
gait
held
herself
less
girlishly
and
on
saying
she
let
her
cheek
rest
for
a
moment
against
her
father
a
thing
she
had
never
yet
done
the
explanation
of
it
all
came
a
few
minutes
after
jane
retirement
michael
warned
by
his
illness
bow
unstable
was
the
tenure
on
which
he
henceforth
held
his
life
had
resolved
to
have
an
end
of
mystery
and
explain
to
his
son
all
that
he
had
already
made
known
to
sidney
kirkwood
with
jane
he
had
spoken
a
few
hours
ago
revealing
to
her
the
power
that
was
in
his
hands
the
solemn
significance
he
attached
to
it
the
responsibility
with
which
her
future
was
to
be
invested
to
make
the
same
things
known
to
joseph
was
a
task
of
more
difficulty
he
could
not
here
count
on
sympathetic
intelligence
it
was
but
too
certain
that
his
son
would
listen
with
disappointment
if
not
with
bitterness
in
order
to
mitigate
the
worst
results
he
began
by
making
known
the
fact
of
his
wealth
and
asking
if
joseph
had
any
practical
views
which
could
be
furthered
by
a
moderate
sum
put
at
his
disposal
my
death
he
added
find
that
i
have
dealt
unkindly
by
you
but
you
a
man
of
middle
age
and
i
should
like
to
see
you
in
some
fixed
way
of
life
before
i
go
having
heard
all
joseph
promised
to
think
over
the
proposal
which
concerned
himself
it
was
in
a
strange
state
of
mind
that
he
returned
to
the
close
one
thing
only
he
was
clear
upon
that
to
clem
and
her
mother
he
would
breathe
no
word
of
what
had
been
told
him
after
a
night
passed
without
a
wink
of
sleep
struggling
with
the
amazement
the
incredulity
the
confusion
of
understanding
caused
by
his
words
he
betook
himself
to
a
familiar
and
there
penned
a
note
to
scawthorne
requesting
an
interview
as
soon
as
possible
the
meeting
took
place
that
evening
at
the
retreat
behind
lincoln
inn
fields
where
the
two
had
held
colloquies
on
several
occasions
during
the
last
scawthorne
received
with
gravity
what
his
acquaintance
had
to
communicate
then
he
observed
will
was
executed
ten
days
ago
was
and
what
he
left
me
thousand
pounds
less
legacy
duty
thirty
thousand
to
jane
so
joseph
drew
in
his
breath
his
teeth
ground
together
for
a
moment
his
eyes
grew
very
wide
with
a
smile
scawthorne
proceeded
to
explain
that
jane
trustees
were
percival
senior
and
his
son
should
she
die
unmarried
before
attaining
her
birthday
the
money
bequeathed
to
her
was
to
be
distributed
among
certain
charities
my
belief
there
a
crank
in
the
old
fellow
exclaimed
joseph
he
really
such
a
fool
as
to
think
jane
wo
use
the
money
for
herself
and
what
about
kirkwood
i
tell
you
what
it
is
he
a
deep
fellow
is
kirkwood
i
wish
you
knew
him
scawthorne
confessed
that
he
had
the
same
wish
but
added
that
there
was
no
chance
of
its
being
realised
prudence
forbade
any
move
in
that
direction
he
marries
her
questioned
joseph
the
money
be
his
it
will
be
settled
on
her
but
it
comes
to
very
much
the
same
thing
there
to
be
no
restraint
on
her
discretion
in
using
it
might
give
her
affectionate
parent
a
hundred
or
so
now
and
then
if
she
chose
she
chose
scawthorne
began
a
detailed
inquiry
into
the
humanitarian
projects
of
which
joseph
had
given
but
a
rude
and
contemptuous
explanation
the
finer
qualities
of
his
mind
enabled
him
to
see
the
matter
in
quite
a
different
light
from
that
in
which
it
presented
itself
to
father
he
had
once
or
twice
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
michael
snowdon
at
the
office
and
could
realise
in
a
measure
the
character
which
directed
its
energies
to
such
an
ideal
aim
concerning
jane
he
asked
many
questions
then
the
conversation
turned
once
more
to
sidney
kirkwood
wish
he
married
his
old
sweetheart
observed
joseph
watching
the
other
face
was
that
girl
called
clara
hewett
their
looks
met
scawthorne
in
spite
of
habitual
betrayed
an
extreme
surprise
wonder
what
become
of
her
continued
joseph
still
observing
his
companion
and
speaking
with
unmistakable
significance
tell
me
something
about
this
said
scawthorne
peremptorily
joseph
complied
and
ended
his
story
with
a
few
more
hints
never
saw
her
myself
at
least
i
ca
be
sure
that
i
did
there
was
somebody
of
the
same
name
clara
a
friend
of
polkenhorne
wife
scawthorne
appeared
to
pay
no
attention
he
mused
with
a
wrinkled
brow
only
i
could
put
something
between
kirkwood
and
the
girl
remarked
joseph
as
if
absently
should
wonder
if
it
could
be
made
worth
some
one
while
to
give
a
bit
of
help
that
way
do
you
think
so
in
the
tone
of
one
turning
to
a
different
subject
scawthorne
asked
suddenly
use
are
you
going
to
make
of
your
father
offer
i
not
quite
sure
should
wonder
if
i
go
in
for
filters
joseph
explained
in
the
capacity
of
agent
denomination
which
includes
and
apologises
for
such
a
vast
variety
of
casual
pursuits
he
had
of
late
been
helping
to
make
known
to
the
public
a
new
filter
which
promised
to
be
a
commercial
success
the
owner
of
the
patent
lacked
capital
and
a
judicious
investment
might
secure
a
share
in
the
business
joseph
thought
of
broaching
the
subject
with
him
next
day
wo
make
a
fool
of
yourself
remarked
scawthorne
me
i
think
i
know
my
way
about
for
the
present
these
gentlemen
had
nothing
more
to
say
to
each
other
they
emptied
their
glasses
with
deliberation
exchanged
a
look
which
might
mean
either
much
or
nothing
and
so
went
their
several
ways
the
filter
project
was
put
into
execution
when
joseph
had
communicated
it
in
detail
to
his
father
the
latter
took
the
professional
advice
of
his
friend
percival
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
joseph
found
himself
regularly
established
in
a
business
which
had
the
for
him
novel
characteristic
of
serving
the
purposes
of
purity
the
manufactory
was
situated
in
a
on
the
north
of
euston
road
a
small
concern
but
at
all
events
a
genuine
one
on
the
window
of
the
office
you
read
snowdon
as
it
was
necessary
to
account
for
this
achievement
to
clem
and
peckover
joseph
made
known
to
them
a
part
of
the
truth
of
the
will
he
said
nothing
and
for
reasons
of
his
own
he
allowed
these
tender
relatives
to
believe
that
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
inherit
the
greater
part
of
michael
possessions
there
was
jubilation
in
clerkenwell
close
but
mother
and
daughter
kept
stern
watch
upon
joseph
proceedings
another
acquaintance
of
ours
benefited
by
this
event
michael
made
it
a
stipulation
that
some
kind
of
work
should
be
found
at
the
factory
for
john
hewett
who
since
his
wife
death
had
been
making
a
wretched
struggle
to
establish
a
more
decent
home
for
the
children
the
firm
of
lake
snowdon
took
hewett
into
their
employment
as
a
porter
and
paid
him
shillings
a
week
of
which
sum
however
the
odd
five
shillings
were
privately
made
up
by
michael
on
receiving
this
appointment
john
drew
the
sigh
of
a
man
who
finds
himself
in
haven
after
perilous
beating
about
a
lee
shore
the
kitchen
in
king
cross
bead
was
abandoned
and
with
sidney
kirkwood
aid
the
family
found
much
more
satisfactory
quarters
friends
of
sidney
a
man
and
wife
of
middle
age
without
children
happened
to
be
looking
for
lodgings
it
was
decided
that
they
and
john
hewett
should
join
in
the
tenancy
of
a
fiat
up
on
the
fifth
storey
of
the
huge
block
of
tenements
called
farringdon
road
buildings
by
this
arrangement
the
children
would
be
looked
after
and
the
weekly
shillings
could
be
made
to
go
much
further
than
on
the
ordinary
system
as
soon
as
everything
had
been
settled
and
when
and
eagles
had
already
housed
themselves
in
the
one
room
which
was
all
they
needed
for
their
private
accommodation
hewett
and
the
children
began
to
pack
together
their
miserable
sticks
and
rags
for
removal
just
then
sidney
kirkwood
looked
in
wants
to
see
you
for
a
minute
about
something
he
said
walk
round
with
me
will
you
john
obeyed
in
the
silent
spiritless
way
now
usual
with
him
it
was
but
a
short
distance
to
the
buildings
they
went
up
the
winding
stone
staircase
and
sidney
gave
a
knock
at
one
of
the
two
doors
that
faced
each
other
on
the
fifth
storey
eagles
opened
a
decent
motherly
woman
with
a
pleasant
and
rather
curious
smile
on
her
face
she
led
the
way
into
one
of
the
rooms
which
john
had
seen
empty
only
a
few
hours
ago
how
was
this
on
the
floor
a
blind
at
the
window
a
bedstead
a
table
a
chest
of
drawers
eagles
withdrew
discreetly
hewett
stood
with
a
look
of
uneasy
wonderment
and
at
length
turned
to
his
companion
look
here
he
growled
in
an
unsteady
voice
all
this
about
seems
to
have
got
here
before
you
replied
sidney
smiling
the
devil
am
i
to
keep
any
if
you
go
on
treatin
me
in
this
fashion
blustered
john
hanging
his
head
is
my
doing
mr
hewett
then
friend
do
make
a
fuss
you
shall
know
the
person
some
day
chapter
xxiii
on
the
eve
of
triumph
have
got
your
letter
but
it
tells
me
no
more
than
the
last
did
why
do
you
say
plainly
what
you
mean
i
suppose
it
something
you
are
ashamed
of
you
say
that
there
a
chance
for
me
of
earning
a
large
sum
of
money
and
if
you
are
in
earnest
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
hear
how
it
to
be
done
this
life
is
no
better
than
what
i
used
to
lead
years
ago
i
no
nearer
to
getting
a
good
part
than
i
was
when
i
first
began
acting
and
unless
i
can
get
money
to
buy
dresses
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
may
go
on
for
ever
at
this
hateful
drudgery
i
shall
take
nothing
more
from
you
i
say
it
and
i
mean
it
but
as
you
tell
me
that
this
chance
has
nothing
to
do
with
yourself
let
me
know
what
it
really
is
for
a
large
sum
of
money
there
are
few
things
i
would
do
of
course
it
something
disgraceful
but
you
need
be
afraid
on
that
account
i
have
lost
all
my
pride
yet
but
i
know
what
i
fighting
for
and
i
wo
be
beaten
cost
what
it
may
i
make
people
hear
of
me
and
talk
of
me
and
i
pay
myself
back
for
all
i
gone
through
so
write
in
plain
words
or
come
and
see
me
she
wrote
at
a
round
table
shaky
on
its
central
support
in
the
parlour
of
an
indifferent
the
october
afternoon
drew
towards
dusk
the
sky
hung
low
and
murky
or
rather
was
itself
invisible
veiled
by
the
fume
of
factory
chimneys
a
wailing
wind
rattled
the
sash
and
the
door
a
newly
lighted
fire
refused
to
flame
cheerfully
half
smothered
in
its
own
smoke
which
every
now
and
then
was
blown
downwards
and
out
into
the
room
the
letter
finished
scribbled
angrily
with
a
bad
pen
and
in
pale
ink
she
put
it
into
its
envelope
scawthorne
esq
then
a
long
reverie
such
as
she
always
fell
into
when
alone
and
unoccupied
the
face
was
older
but
not
greatly
changed
from
that
of
the
girl
who
fought
her
dread
fight
with
temptation
and
lost
it
in
the
lodging
at
islington
who
then
as
now
brooded
over
the
wild
passions
in
her
heart
and
defied
the
world
that
was
her
enemy
still
a
beautiful
face
its
haughty
characteristics
strengthened
the
lips
a
little
more
sensual
a
little
coarser
still
the
same
stamp
of
intellect
upon
the
forehead
the
same
impatient
scorn
and
misery
in
her
eyes
she
asked
no
one
pity
but
not
many
women
breathed
at
that
moment
who
knew
more
of
suffering
for
three
weeks
she
had
belonged
to
a
company
on
tour
in
the
northern
counties
in
accordance
with
the
modern
custom
so
beneficial
to
actors
and
the
public
their
repertory
consisted
of
one
play
the
famous
melodrama
secret
of
the
thames
recommended
to
provincial
audiences
by
its
run
of
four
hundred
and
nights
at
a
london
theatre
these
to
be
sure
were
not
the
london
actors
but
advertisements
in
local
newspapers
gave
it
to
be
understood
that
they
an
in
no
respect
inferior
to
that
which
was
so
long
the
delight
of
the
metropolis
starred
on
the
placards
was
the
name
of
samuel
peel
renowned
in
the
north
of
england
his
was
the
company
and
his
the
main
glory
in
the
piece
as
leading
lady
he
had
the
distinguished
miss
erminia
walcott
her
part
was
a
trying
one
for
she
had
to
be
by
ruffians
and
flung
most
decorously
over
the
parapet
of
london
bridge
in
the
long
list
of
subordinate
performers
occurred
two
names
with
which
we
are
familiar
miss
grace
danver
and
miss
clara
vale
the
present
evening
would
be
the
third
and
last
in
a
certain
town
of
lancashire
one
of
those
remarkable
centres
of
industry
which
pollute
heaven
and
earth
and
on
that
account
are
spoken
of
with
somewhat
more
of
pride
than
stirred
the
athenian
when
he
named
his
acropolis
clara
had
just
risen
to
stir
the
fire
compelled
to
move
by
the
smoke
that
was
annoying
her
when
after
a
tap
at
the
door
there
came
in
a
young
woman
of
about
in
a
plain
walking
costume
tall
very
slender
pretty
but
looking
at
this
moment
there
was
a
slight
flush
on
her
cheeks
and
a
brightness
in
her
eyes
which
obviously
came
of
some
excitement
she
paused
just
after
entering
and
said
in
an
eager
voice
which
had
a
touch
of
huskiness
do
you
think
miss
walcott
taken
her
hook
clara
did
not
allow
herself
to
be
moved
at
this
announcement
for
several
days
what
is
called
unpleasantness
had
existed
between
the
leading
lady
and
the
manager
in
other
words
they
had
been
quarrelling
violently
on
certain
professional
matters
and
miss
walcott
had
threatened
to
ruin
the
tour
by
withdrawing
her
invaluable
services
the
menace
was
at
last
executed
in
good
earnest
and
the
cause
of
grace
danver
excitement
was
that
she
as
miss
walcott
understudy
would
in
all
probability
be
called
upon
to
take
the
leading
part
glad
to
hear
it
clara
replied
very
soberly
do
look
as
if
you
cared
much
rejoined
the
other
with
a
little
irritation
do
you
want
me
to
do
am
i
to
scream
with
joy
because
the
greatest
actress
in
the
world
has
got
her
chance
at
last
there
was
bitterness
in
the
irony
whatever
their
friendship
in
days
gone
by
these
two
were
clearly
not
on
the
most
amiable
terms
at
present
this
was
their
first
engagement
in
the
same
company
and
it
had
needed
but
a
week
of
association
to
put
a
jealousy
and
between
them
which
proved
fatal
to
such
mutual
kindness
as
they
had
previously
cherished
grace
now
no
less
than
in
her
schooldays
was
fond
of
patronising
as
the
elder
in
years
and
in
experience
she
adopted
a
tone
which
clara
speedily
resented
to
heighten
the
danger
of
a
conflict
between
natures
essentially
incompatible
both
were
in
a
morbid
and
nervous
state
consumed
with
discontent
sensitive
to
the
most
trifling
injury
abandoned
to
a
fierce
egoism
which
the
course
of
their
lives
and
the
circumstances
of
their
profession
kept
constantly
inflamed
grace
was
of
acrid
and
violent
temper
when
stung
with
words
such
as
clara
was
only
too
apt
at
using
she
speedily
lost
command
of
herself
and
spoke
or
even
acted
frantically
except
that
she
had
not
clara
sensibilities
her
lot
was
the
harder
of
the
two
for
she
knew
herself
stricken
with
a
malady
which
would
hunt
her
unsparingly
to
the
grave
on
her
story
i
have
no
time
to
dwell
it
was
fall
of
wretchedness
which
had
caused
her
about
a
year
ago
to
make
an
attempt
at
suicide
a
little
generosity
and
clara
might
have
helped
to
soothe
the
pains
of
one
so
much
weaker
than
herself
but
noble
feeling
was
extinct
in
the
girl
or
so
nearly
extinct
that
a
breath
of
petty
rivalry
could
make
her
base
cruel
remorseless
all
events
i
got
my
chance
exclaimed
grace
with
a
harsh
laugh
you
get
yours
ask
me
to
congratulate
you
and
she
swept
her
skirts
out
of
the
room
in
a
few
minutes
clara
put
a
stamp
on
her
letter
and
went
out
to
the
post
her
presence
at
the
theatre
would
not
be
necessary
for
another
two
hours
but
as
the
distance
was
slight
and
nervousness
would
not
let
her
remain
at
home
she
walked
on
to
make
inquiry
concerning
grace
news
rain
had
just
begun
to
fall
and
with
it
descended
the
smut
and
grime
that
darkened
above
the
houses
the
pavement
was
speedily
with
sticky
mud
and
passing
vehicles
flung
splashes
in
every
direction
odours
of
oil
and
shoddy
and
all
such
things
as
characterised
the
town
grew
more
pungent
under
the
heavy
shower
on
reaching
the
clara
found
two
or
three
of
her
companions
just
within
the
sudden
departure
of
miss
walcott
had
become
known
to
everyone
and
at
this
moment
peel
was
holding
a
council
to
which
as
the
doorkeeper
testified
miss
danver
had
been
summoned
the
manager
decided
to
make
no
public
announcement
of
what
had
happened
before
the
hour
came
for
drawing
up
the
curtain
a
scrappy
rehearsal
for
the
benefit
of
grace
danver
and
the
two
or
three
other
ladies
who
were
affected
by
the
necessary
rearrangement
went
on
until
the
last
possible
moment
then
peel
presented
himself
before
the
drop
and
made
a
little
speech
the
gallery
was
fall
of
in
the
pit
was
a
sprinkling
of
people
the
circles
and
boxes
presented
half
a
dozen
occupants
domestic
calamity
enforced
absence
of
the
lady
who
played
efficient
substitution
deep
regret
but
confidence
in
the
friendly
feeling
of
audience
on
this
last
evening
they
growled
but
in
the
end
applauded
the
who
had
succeeded
in
delicately
hinting
that
after
all
the
great
attraction
was
still
present
in
his
own
person
the
play
went
very
much
as
usual
but
those
behind
the
scenes
were
not
allowed
to
forget
that
peel
was
in
a
furious
temper
the
ladies
noticed
with
satisfaction
that
more
than
once
he
glared
ominously
at
miss
danver
who
naturally
could
not
aid
him
to
make
his
as
miss
walcott
had
accustomed
herself
to
do
at
his
final
exit
it
was
observed
that
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
muttered
a
few
oaths
clara
had
her
familiar
part
it
was
a
poor
one
from
every
point
of
view
and
the
imbecility
of
the
words
she
had
to
speak
affected
her
with
exceptional
irritation
clara
always
acted
in
she
despised
her
audience
for
their
acceptance
of
the
claptrap
she
felt
that
she
could
do
better
than
any
of
the
actresses
entrusted
with
the
more
important
characters
her
imagination
was
for
ever
turning
to
powerful
scenes
in
plays
she
had
studied
privately
and
despair
possessed
her
at
the
thought
that
she
would
perhaps
never
have
a
chance
of
putting
forth
her
strength
tonight
her
mood
was
one
of
sullen
carelessness
she
did
little
more
than
through
her
part
feeling
a
pleasure
in
thus
insulting
the
house
one
scrap
of
dialogue
she
had
with
grace
and
her
eyes
answered
with
a
flash
of
hatred
to
the
arrogance
of
the
other
regard
at
another
point
she
all
but
missed
her
cue
for
her
thoughts
were
busy
with
that
letter
to
which
she
had
replied
this
afternoon
peel
looked
at
her
savagely
and
she
met
his
silent
rebuke
with
an
air
of
indifference
after
that
the
manager
appeared
to
pay
peculiar
attention
to
her
as
often
as
they
were
together
before
the
footlights
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
peel
had
allowed
her
to
see
that
she
was
an
object
of
interest
to
him
there
was
an
but
clara
was
not
engaged
in
it
when
at
the
fall
of
the
curtain
on
the
melodrama
she
went
to
the
shabby
which
she
shared
with
two
companions
a
message
delivered
by
the
call
boy
bade
her
repair
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
office
what
might
this
mean
she
was
startled
on
the
instant
but
speedily
recovered
her
most
likely
she
was
to
receive
a
rating
let
it
come
without
unusual
hurry
she
washed
changed
her
dress
and
obeyed
the
summons
peel
was
still
a
young
man
of
tall
and
robust
stature
sanguine
with
much
sham
refinement
in
his
manner
he
prided
himself
on
the
civility
with
which
he
behaved
to
all
who
had
business
relations
with
him
but
every
now
and
then
the
veneer
gave
an
awkward
crack
and
as
in
his
debate
with
miss
walcott
the
man
himself
was
discovered
to
be
of
coarse
grain
his
aspect
was
singular
when
on
clara
entrance
into
the
private
room
he
laid
down
his
cigarette
and
scrutinised
her
there
was
a
fiery
hue
on
his
visage
and
the
scowl
of
his
black
eyebrows
had
a
peculiar
ugliness
vale
he
began
after
hesitation
you
consider
that
you
played
your
part
this
evening
with
the
conscientiousness
that
may
fairly
be
expected
of
you
not
replied
the
girl
averting
her
eyes
and
resting
her
hand
on
the
table
may
i
ask
not
did
feel
in
the
humour
the
house
saw
no
difference
the
house
saw
no
difference
do
you
mean
to
imply
that
you
always
play
badly
mean
that
the
part
is
worth
any
attention
even
if
they
were
able
to
judge
there
was
a
perfection
of
insolence
in
her
tone
that
in
itself
spoke
strongly
for
the
abilities
she
could
display
if
occasion
offered
is
rather
an
offhand
way
of
treating
the
subject
madam
cried
peel
you
disparage
our
audiences
i
beg
you
to
observe
that
it
is
much
the
same
thing
as
telling
me
that
my
own
successes
are
worthless
intended
nothing
of
the
kind
not
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
looked
down
at
his
boots
for
an
instant
you
are
discontented
with
your
part
only
natural
that
i
should
be
presume
you
think
yourself
equal
to
juliet
or
perhaps
lady
macbeth
could
play
either
a
good
deal
better
than
most
women
do
the
manager
laughed
by
no
means
sorry
i
ca
bring
you
out
in
shakespeare
just
at
present
miss
vale
but
should
you
think
it
a
condescension
to
play
laura
denton
this
was
miss
walcott
part
now
grace
danver
clara
looked
at
him
with
mistrust
her
breath
did
not
come
quite
naturally
long
would
it
take
you
do
you
think
pursued
the
other
get
the
words
hour
or
two
i
all
but
know
them
the
manager
took
a
few
paces
this
way
and
that
go
on
to
bolton
morning
could
you
undertake
to
be
perfect
for
the
afternoon
rehearsal
i
try
you
here
a
copy
you
can
take
i
make
no
terms
you
understand
it
an
experiment
we
have
another
talk
she
left
the
room
near
the
door
stood
grace
danver
and
another
actress
both
of
whom
were
bidden
to
wait
upon
the
manager
before
leaving
clara
passed
under
the
fire
of
their
eyes
but
scarcely
observed
them
rain
drenched
her
between
the
theatre
and
her
lodgings
for
she
did
not
think
of
putting
up
an
umbrella
she
thought
indeed
of
nothing
there
was
fire
and
tumult
in
her
brain
on
the
round
table
in
her
supper
was
made
ready
but
she
did
not
heed
it
excitement
compelled
her
to
walk
incessantly
round
and
round
the
scanty
space
of
floor
already
she
had
begun
to
rehearse
the
chief
scenes
of
laura
denton
she
spoke
the
words
with
all
appropriate
loudness
and
emphasis
her
gestures
were
those
of
the
stage
as
though
an
audience
sat
before
her
she
seemed
to
have
grown
taller
there
came
a
double
knock
at
the
but
it
did
not
attract
her
attention
a
knock
at
her
own
room
and
only
when
some
one
entered
was
she
recalled
to
the
present
it
was
grace
again
her
lodging
was
elsewhere
and
this
late
visit
could
have
but
one
motive
they
stood
face
to
face
the
elder
woman
was
so
incensed
that
her
lips
moved
fruitlessly
like
those
of
a
paralytic
suppose
you
going
to
make
a
scene
clara
addressed
her
remember
how
late
it
is
and
do
let
all
the
house
hear
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
accepted
that
offer
of
peel
without
saying
a
word
without
as
much
as
telling
him
that
he
ought
to
speak
to
me
first
i
did
i
waited
long
enough
i
not
going
to
beat
about
the
bush
when
my
chance
comes
you
called
yourself
my
friend
nobody
friend
but
my
own
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
if
been
in
my
place
you
have
done
just
the
same
would
i
have
been
such
a
mean
creature
every
man
and
woman
in
the
company
cry
shame
on
you
deafen
me
with
your
nonsense
if
you
played
the
part
badly
i
suppose
some
one
else
must
take
it
you
were
only
on
trial
like
i
shall
be
grace
was
livid
with
fury
badly
as
if
we
did
all
know
how
you
managed
it
much
it
has
to
do
with
good
or
bad
acting
we
know
how
creatures
of
your
kind
get
what
they
want
before
the
last
word
was
uttered
she
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
her
cheeks
flamed
and
spots
of
blood
reddened
on
the
handkerchief
she
put
to
her
mouth
she
lay
back
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
by
the
door
clara
regarded
her
with
a
contemptuous
pity
and
when
the
cough
had
nearly
ceased
said
coldly
not
going
to
try
and
match
you
in
insulting
language
i
dare
say
you
beat
me
at
that
if
you
take
my
advice
you
go
home
and
take
care
of
yourself
you
look
ill
enough
to
be
in
bed
i
do
care
what
you
or
anyone
else
thinks
of
me
what
you
said
just
now
was
a
lie
but
it
does
matter
i
got
the
part
and
i
take
good
care
that
i
keep
it
you
talk
about
us
being
friends
i
should
have
thought
you
knew
by
this
time
that
there
no
such
thing
as
friendship
or
generosity
or
feeling
for
women
who
have
to
make
their
way
in
the
world
you
had
your
hard
times
as
well
as
i
and
what
the
use
of
pretending
what
you
do
believe
you
would
give
up
a
chance
for
me
i
sure
i
should
never
expect
you
to
we
have
to
fight
to
fight
for
everything
and
the
weak
get
beaten
that
what
life
has
taught
me
right
was
the
other
reply
given
with
a
strangely
sudden
calmness
we
see
who
wins
clara
gave
no
thought
to
the
words
nor
to
the
look
of
deadly
enmity
that
accompanied
them
alone
again
she
speedily
became
absorbed
in
a
vision
of
the
triumph
which
she
never
doubted
was
near
at
hand
a
long
long
time
it
seemed
since
she
had
sold
herself
to
degradation
with
this
one
hope
you
see
that
she
had
formulated
her
philosophy
of
life
since
then
a
child
of
the
nether
world
whom
fate
had
endowed
with
intellect
she
gave
articulate
utterance
to
what
is
seething
in
the
brains
of
thousands
who
fight
and
perish
in
the
obscure
depths
the
bitter
bargain
was
issuing
to
her
profit
at
last
she
would
yet
attain
that
end
which
had
shone
through
all
her
misery
to
be
known
as
a
successful
actress
by
those
she
had
abandoned
whose
faces
were
growing
dim
to
her
memory
but
of
whom
in
truth
she
still
thought
more
than
of
all
the
multitudinous
unknown
public
a
great
success
during
the
remainder
of
this
tour
and
she
might
hope
for
an
engagement
in
london
her
portraits
would
at
length
be
in
the
windows
some
would
recognise
her
yet
she
was
not
so
pitiless
as
she
boasted
the
next
morning
when
she
met
grace
there
came
a
pain
at
her
heart
in
seeing
the
ghastly
bloodless
countenance
which
refused
to
turn
towards
her
would
grace
be
able
to
act
at
all
at
the
next
town
yes
one
more
scene
they
reached
bolton
in
the
afternoon
the
rehearsal
took
place
but
the
first
representation
was
not
until
clara
saw
her
name
attached
to
the
leading
female
character
on
bills
rapidly
printed
and
distributed
through
the
town
she
went
about
in
a
dream
rather
a
delirium
peel
used
his
most
affable
manner
to
her
his
compliments
after
the
rehearsal
were
an
augury
of
great
things
and
the
eventful
evening
approached
to
give
herself
plenty
of
time
to
dress
the
costumes
needed
for
the
part
were
fortunately
simple
and
peel
had
advanced
her
money
to
make
needful
purchases
she
left
her
lodgings
at
six
it
was
a
fine
evening
but
very
dark
in
the
two
or
three
along
which
she
had
to
pass
to
reach
the
theatre
she
waited
a
minute
on
the
doorstep
to
let
a
troop
of
female
go
by
their
shoes
clanked
on
the
pavement
and
they
were
singing
in
chorus
a
common
habit
of
their
kind
in
leaving
work
then
she
started
and
walked
quickly
close
by
the
which
was
in
a
dark
narrow
passage
stood
a
woman
with
veiled
face
a
shawl
muffling
the
upper
part
of
her
body
since
six
she
had
been
waiting
about
the
spot
occasionally
walking
to
a
short
distance
but
always
keeping
her
face
turned
towards
the
door
one
or
two
persons
came
up
and
entered
she
observed
them
but
held
aloof
another
drew
near
the
woman
advanced
and
as
she
did
so
freed
one
of
her
arms
from
the
shawl
you
grace
said
clara
almost
kindly
for
in
her
victorious
joy
she
was
ready
to
be
at
peace
with
all
the
world
the
answer
was
something
dashed
violently
in
her
face
something
fluid
and
fiery
something
that
ate
into
her
flesh
that
frenzied
her
with
pain
that
drove
her
shrieking
she
knew
not
whither
late
in
the
same
night
a
pointsman
walking
along
the
railway
a
little
distance
out
of
the
town
came
upon
the
body
of
a
woman
horrible
to
view
she
wore
the
dress
of
a
lady
a
shawl
was
still
partly
wrapped
about
her
and
her
hands
were
gloved
nothing
discoverable
upon
her
would
have
helped
strangers
in
the
task
of
identification
and
as
for
her
face
but
a
missing
woman
was
already
sought
by
the
police
and
when
certain
persons
were
taken
to
view
this
body
they
had
no
difficulty
in
pronouncing
it
that
of
grace
danver
chapter
xxiv
the
family
history
progresses
what
could
possess
john
hewett
that
after
resting
from
the
day
work
he
often
left
his
comfortable
room
late
in
the
evening
and
rambled
about
the
streets
of
that
part
of
london
which
had
surely
least
interest
for
him
the
streets
which
are
thronged
with
idlers
with
carriages
going
homeward
from
the
theatres
with
those
who
can
only
come
forth
to
ply
their
business
when
darkness
has
fallen
did
he
seek
food
for
his
antagonism
in
observing
the
characteristics
of
the
world
in
which
he
was
a
stranger
the
world
which
has
its
garners
full
and
takes
its
ease
amid
superfluity
it
could
scarcely
be
that
for
since
his
wife
death
an
indifference
seemed
to
be
settling
upon
him
he
no
longer
cared
to
visit
the
green
or
his
club
on
sunday
and
seldom
spoke
on
the
subjects
which
formerly
goaded
him
to
madness
he
appeared
to
be
drawn
forth
against
his
will
in
spite
of
weariness
and
his
look
as
he
walked
on
was
that
of
a
man
who
is
in
search
of
some
one
yet
whom
could
he
expect
to
meet
in
these
highways
of
the
west
end
oxford
street
regent
street
piccadilly
the
strand
the
ways
about
james
park
john
hewett
was
not
the
only
father
who
has
come
forth
after
nightfall
from
an
obscure
home
to
look
darkly
at
the
faces
passing
on
these
broad
pavements
at
times
he
would
shrink
into
a
shadowed
corner
and
peer
thence
at
those
who
went
by
under
the
gaslight
when
he
moved
forward
it
was
with
the
uneasy
gait
of
one
who
shuns
observation
you
would
have
thought
perchance
that
he
watched
an
opportunity
of
begging
and
was
shamefaced
it
happened
now
and
then
that
he
was
regarded
suspiciously
a
man
with
grizzled
beard
with
eyes
generally
bloodshot
his
shoulders
stooping
naturally
the
miserable
are
always
suspected
where
law
is
conscious
of
its
injustice
two
years
ago
he
was
beset
for
a
time
with
the
same
restlessness
and
took
in
the
same
directions
the
habit
wore
away
however
now
it
possessed
him
even
more
strongly
between
ten
and
eleven
when
the
children
were
in
bed
he
fell
into
abstraction
and
presently
with
an
unexpected
movement
looked
up
as
if
some
one
had
spoken
to
him
just
the
look
of
one
who
hears
a
familiar
voice
then
he
sighed
and
took
his
hat
and
went
forth
it
happened
sometimes
when
he
was
sitting
with
his
friends
and
eagles
in
that
case
he
would
make
some
kind
of
excuse
the
couple
suspected
that
his
business
would
take
him
to
the
but
john
never
came
back
with
a
sign
about
him
of
having
drunk
of
that
failing
he
had
broken
himself
he
went
cautiously
down
the
stone
stairs
averting
his
face
if
anyone
met
him
then
by
he
reached
gray
inn
road
and
so
westwards
he
had
a
home
and
his
children
were
about
him
but
these
things
did
not
compensate
him
for
the
greatest
loss
his
life
had
suffered
the
children
in
truth
had
no
very
strong
hold
upon
his
affections
sometimes
when
amy
sat
and
talked
to
him
he
showed
a
growing
nervousness
an
impatience
and
at
length
turned
away
from
her
as
if
to
occupy
himself
in
some
manner
the
voice
was
not
that
which
had
ever
power
to
soothe
him
when
it
spoke
playfully
memory
brought
back
the
tones
which
had
been
so
dear
to
him
and
at
times
something
more
than
memory
he
seemed
really
to
hear
them
as
if
from
a
distance
and
then
it
was
that
he
went
out
to
wander
in
the
streets
of
bob
in
the
meantime
he
saw
scarcely
anything
that
young
man
presented
himself
one
sunday
shortly
after
his
father
had
become
settled
in
the
new
home
but
practically
he
was
a
stranger
john
and
he
had
no
interests
in
common
there
even
existed
a
slight
antipathy
on
the
father
part
of
late
years
strangely
enough
this
feeling
expressed
itself
one
day
in
the
form
of
a
rebuke
to
bob
for
neglecting
pennyloaf
pennyloaf
whom
john
had
always
declined
to
recognise
hear
no
good
of
your
goin
on
remarked
hewett
on
a
casual
encounter
in
the
street
married
man
ought
to
give
up
the
kind
of
company
as
you
keep
do
no
harm
replied
bob
bluntly
my
wife
been
complaining
to
you
nothing
to
do
with
her
it
what
i
told
kirkwood
i
suppose
you
better
not
have
made
up
with
him
again
if
he
only
making
mischief
i
did
mean
kirkwood
and
john
went
his
way
odd
thing
was
it
not
that
this
embittered
leveller
should
himself
practise
the
very
intolerance
which
he
reviled
in
people
of
the
upper
world
for
his
refusal
to
recognise
pennyloaf
he
had
absolutely
no
grounds
save
i
use
the
words
advisedly
an
aristocratic
prejudice
bob
had
married
deplorably
beneath
him
it
was
unpardonable
let
the
character
of
the
girl
be
what
it
might
of
course
you
recognise
the
item
in
john
hewett
personality
which
serves
to
explain
this
singular
attitude
but
viewed
generally
it
was
one
of
those
bits
of
human
inconsistency
over
which
the
observer
smiles
and
which
should
be
recommended
to
good
people
in
search
of
arguments
for
the
equality
of
men
after
that
little
dialogue
bob
went
home
in
a
disagreeable
temper
to
begin
with
his
mood
had
been
ruffled
for
the
landlady
at
his
lodgings
the
fourth
to
which
he
had
removed
this
year
was
about
a
week
or
two
of
unpaid
rent
and
a
man
on
whom
he
had
counted
this
evening
for
the
payment
of
a
debt
was
keeping
out
of
his
way
he
found
pennyloaf
sitting
on
the
stairs
with
her
two
children
as
usual
poor
pennyloaf
had
not
originality
enough
to
discover
new
expressions
of
misery
and
that
one
bright
idea
of
donning
her
best
dress
was
a
single
instance
of
ingenuity
in
obedience
to
jane
snowdon
she
kept
herself
and
the
babies
and
the
room
tolerably
clean
but
everything
was
done
in
the
most
dispirited
way
are
you
kicking
about
here
for
asked
bob
impatiently
how
that
kid
gets
its
cold
of
course
it
is
ger
out
the
last
remark
was
addressed
to
the
elder
child
who
caught
at
his
legs
as
he
strode
past
bob
was
not
actively
unkind
to
the
little
wretches
for
whose
being
he
was
responsible
he
simply
occupied
the
natural
position
of
unsophisticated
man
to
children
of
that
age
one
of
indifference
or
impatience
the
infants
were
a
nuisance
no
one
desired
their
coming
and
the
older
they
grew
the
more
expensive
they
were
it
was
a
cold
evening
of
october
pennyloaf
had
allowed
the
fire
to
get
very
low
she
knew
not
exactly
where
the
next
supply
of
coals
was
to
come
from
and
her
husband
growled
as
he
made
a
vain
endeavour
to
warm
his
hands
have
you
got
tea
ready
he
asked
could
be
sure
as
you
was
comin
bob
how
could
i
but
i
soon
get
the
kettle
boilin
be
sure
as
i
was
coming
why
i
been
back
every
night
this
week
except
two
or
three
it
was
thursday
but
bob
meant
nothing
jocose
here
he
continued
fixing
a
surly
eye
upon
her
do
you
mean
by
complaining
about
me
to
people
just
mind
your
own
business
when
was
that
girl
jane
snowdon
here
last
bob
thought
as
much
did
she
give
you
anything
he
made
this
inquiry
in
rather
a
shamefaced
way
she
did
i
tell
you
what
it
is
i
not
going
to
have
her
coming
about
the
place
so
understand
that
when
she
comes
next
you
just
tell
her
she
need
come
again
pennyloaf
looked
at
him
with
dismay
for
the
delivery
of
this
command
bob
had
seated
himself
on
the
corner
of
the
table
and
crossed
his
arms
but
for
the
touch
of
in
his
appearance
bob
would
have
been
a
very
fellow
his
face
was
healthy
by
no
means
commonplace
in
its
mould
and
had
the
peculiar
vividness
which
indicates
ability
so
impressive
because
so
rarely
seen
in
men
of
his
level
unfortunately
his
hair
was
cropped
all
but
to
the
scalp
in
the
fashionable
manner
it
was
greased
too
and
curled
up
on
one
side
of
his
forehead
with
a
peculiarly
offensive
perkishness
poor
pennyloaf
was
in
a
great
degree
responsible
for
the
ills
of
her
married
life
not
only
did
she
believe
bob
to
be
the
handsomest
man
who
walked
the
earth
but
in
her
weakness
she
could
not
refrain
from
telling
him
as
much
at
the
present
moment
he
was
intensely
with
eye
upon
him
he
posed
for
effect
the
idea
of
forbidding
future
intercourse
with
jane
had
come
to
him
quite
suddenly
it
was
by
no
means
his
intention
to
make
his
order
permanent
for
jane
had
now
and
then
brought
little
presents
which
were
useful
but
just
now
he
felt
a
satisfaction
in
asserting
authority
jane
should
understand
that
he
regarded
her
censure
of
him
with
high
displeasure
do
mean
that
bob
murmured
pennyloaf
course
i
do
and
let
me
catch
you
disobeying
me
i
should
think
you
might
find
better
friends
than
a
girl
as
used
to
be
the
dirty
little
servant
bob
turned
up
his
nose
and
sniffed
the
air
and
pennyloaf
in
spite
of
the
keenest
distress
actually
felt
that
there
was
something
in
the
objection
thus
framed
she
herself
had
never
been
a
servant
never
she
had
never
sunk
below
working
with
the
needle
for
sixteen
hours
a
day
for
a
payment
of
ninepence
the
regards
a
domestic
slave
as
very
distinctly
her
inferior
that
a
long
while
ago
she
ventured
to
urge
after
reflection
makes
no
difference
do
as
i
tell
you
and
do
argue
it
was
not
often
that
visitors
sought
bob
at
his
home
of
an
evening
but
whilst
this
dialogue
was
still
going
on
an
acquaintance
made
his
arrival
known
by
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
a
lank
and
hungry
individual
grimy
of
face
and
hands
his
clothing
such
as
in
the
country
would
serve
well
for
a
scarecrow
who
could
have
recognised
in
him
the
once
spruce
and
spirited
jack
bartley
distinguished
by
his
hat
at
the
crystal
palace
on
bob
at
the
close
of
that
same
day
as
you
remember
he
and
bob
engaged
in
terrific
combat
the
outcome
of
earlier
rivalry
for
the
favour
of
clem
peckover
notwithstanding
that
memory
the
two
were
now
on
very
friendly
terms
you
have
heard
from
clem
lips
that
jack
bartley
failing
to
win
herself
ended
by
espousing
miss
susan
jollop
also
what
was
the
result
of
that
alliance
bartley
was
an
unhappy
man
his
wife
had
a
ferocious
temper
was
reckless
with
money
and
now
drank
steadily
the
consequence
was
that
jack
had
lost
all
regular
employment
and
only
earned
occasional
pence
in
the
most
various
ways
broken
in
spirit
he
himself
first
made
advances
to
his
companion
of
former
days
and
bob
flattered
by
the
other
humility
encouraged
him
as
a
really
we
shall
soon
be
coming
to
a
conclusion
that
the
differences
between
the
nether
and
the
upper
world
are
purely
superficial
whenever
jack
came
to
spend
an
hour
with
and
hewett
he
was
sure
sooner
or
later
to
indulge
the
misery
that
preyed
upon
him
and
give
way
to
sheer
weeping
he
did
so
this
evening
almost
as
soon
as
he
entered
ai
had
a
mouthful
past
my
lips
since
last
night
i
ai
he
sobbed
on
a
feller
as
used
to
have
his
meals
regular
murder
suke
yet
see
if
i
do
i
have
her
life
she
met
me
last
night
and
gave
me
this
black
eye
as
you
see
she
did
it
on
a
feller
mean
to
say
as
she
you
cried
pennyloaf
bob
chuckled
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
spread
himself
out
his
own
superiority
was
so
gloriously
manifest
try
it
on
with
penny
he
cried
give
me
something
as
i
should
remember
she
answered
smirking
the
good
little
slavey
wonder
if
i
did
assented
bob
bartley
pressing
hunger
was
satisfied
with
some
bread
and
butter
and
a
cup
of
tea
whilst
taking
a
share
of
the
meal
bob
brought
a
small
box
on
to
the
table
it
had
a
sliding
lid
and
inside
were
certain
specimens
of
artistic
work
with
which
he
was
wont
to
amuse
himself
when
tired
of
roaming
the
streets
in
jovial
company
do
you
recollect
that
when
we
first
made
bob
acquaintance
he
showed
sidney
kirkwood
a
medal
of
his
own
design
and
casting
his
daily
work
at
had
of
course
supplied
him
with
this
suggestion
and
he
still
found
pleasure
in
work
of
the
same
kind
in
days
before
commercialism
had
divorced
art
and
the
handicrafts
a
man
with
distinct
faculty
would
have
found
encouragement
to
exercise
it
for
serious
ends
as
it
was
he
remained
at
the
stage
with
regard
to
his
own
aptitudes
and
cast
leaden
medals
just
as
a
way
of
occupying
his
hands
when
a
couple
of
hours
hung
heavy
on
them
partly
with
the
thought
of
amusing
the
dolorous
jack
yet
more
to
win
laudation
he
brought
forth
now
a
variety
of
casts
and
moulds
and
spread
them
on
the
table
his
latest
piece
of
work
was
a
medal
in
high
relief
bearing
the
heads
of
the
prince
and
princess
of
wales
surrounded
with
a
wreath
bob
had
no
political
convictions
with
complacency
he
drew
these
royal
features
the
sight
of
which
would
have
made
his
father
foam
at
the
mouth
true
he
might
have
found
subjects
artistically
more
satisfying
but
he
belonged
to
the
people
and
the
english
people
jack
bartley
having
dried
his
eyes
and
swallowed
his
bread
and
butter
considered
the
medal
with
much
attention
say
he
remarked
at
length
you
give
me
this
bob
do
mind
you
can
take
it
if
you
like
jack
wrapped
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
before
long
rose
to
take
leave
of
his
friends
only
wish
i
got
a
wife
like
you
he
observed
at
the
door
as
he
saw
pennyloaf
bending
over
the
two
children
recently
put
to
bed
pennyloaf
eyes
gleamed
at
the
compliment
and
she
turned
them
to
her
husband
nothing
to
boast
of
said
bob
judicially
and
masculinely
women
are
pretty
much
alike
and
pennyloaf
tried
to
smile
at
the
snub
having
devoted
one
evening
to
domestic
quietude
bob
naturally
felt
himself
free
to
dispose
of
the
next
in
a
manner
more
to
his
taste
the
pleasures
which
sufficed
to
keep
him
from
home
had
the
same
sordid
monotony
which
characterises
life
in
general
for
the
lower
strata
of
society
if
he
had
money
there
was
the
if
he
had
none
there
were
the
streets
being
in
the
latter
condition
he
joined
a
company
of
male
and
female
intimates
and
with
them
strolled
aimlessly
from
one
familiar
rendezvous
to
another
would
that
it
were
possible
to
set
down
a
literal
report
of
the
conversation
which
passed
during
hours
thus
spent
much
of
it
of
course
would
be
merely
revolting
but
for
the
most
part
it
would
consist
of
such
wearying
such
incredible
imbecilities
as
no
human
patience
could
endure
through
five
minutes
perusal
realise
it
however
and
you
grasp
the
conditions
of
what
is
called
the
social
problem
as
regards
robert
hewett
in
particular
it
would
help
you
to
understand
the
momentous
change
in
his
life
which
was
just
coming
to
pass
on
his
reaching
home
at
eleven
pennyloaf
met
him
with
the
news
that
jack
bartley
had
looked
in
twice
and
seemed
very
anxious
to
see
him
being
saturday
jack
would
call
again
early
in
the
afternoon
when
the
time
came
he
presented
himself
hungry
and
dirty
as
ever
but
with
an
unwonted
liveliness
in
his
eye
got
something
to
say
to
you
he
began
in
a
low
voice
nodding
significantly
towards
pennyloaf
and
buy
what
you
want
for
said
bob
to
his
wife
giving
her
some
money
out
of
his
wages
the
kids
disappointed
in
being
thus
excluded
from
confidence
but
obedient
as
ever
pennyloaf
speedily
prepared
herself
and
the
children
the
younger
of
whom
she
still
had
to
carry
when
she
was
gone
bartley
assumed
a
peculiar
attitude
and
began
to
speak
in
an
undertone
know
that
medal
as
you
gave
me
the
other
night
about
it
sold
it
for
fourpence
to
a
chap
i
know
it
got
me
a
bed
at
the
lodgings
in
pentonville
road
you
did
well
what
else
jack
was
writhing
in
the
most
unaccountable
way
peering
hither
and
thither
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
seeming
to
have
an
obstruction
in
his
throat
was
in
a
as
i
sold
it
a
chap
i
know
there
was
another
chap
as
i
did
know
standing
just
by
see
he
kep
looking
at
the
medal
and
he
kep
looking
at
me
when
i
went
out
the
chap
as
i
did
know
followed
behind
me
i
did
see
him
at
first
but
he
come
up
with
me
just
at
the
top
of
rosoman
street
a
chap
looked
like
a
corster
hollo
says
he
hollo
says
i
got
any
more
them
medals
he
says
in
a
quiet
way
like
what
do
you
want
to
know
for
i
says
you
see
he
was
a
bloke
as
i
did
know
nothing
about
and
there
no
good
being
with
your
talk
he
got
me
to
walk
on
a
bit
with
him
and
kept
talking
you
did
buy
that
nowhere
he
says
with
a
sort
of
wink
what
if
i
did
i
says
there
no
harm
as
i
know
well
he
kept
on
with
his
sort
o
winks
and
then
he
says
got
any
to
put
round
at
this
point
jack
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
looked
timorously
towards
the
door
know
what
he
meant
bob
bob
nodded
and
became
reflective
i
did
say
nothing
pursued
bartley
the
chap
stuck
to
me
a
fair
price
for
a
fair
article
he
says
you
always
find
me
there
of
a
thursday
night
if
you
got
any
business
going
give
me
a
look
round
he
says
it
ai
in
my
line
i
says
so
he
gave
a
grin
like
and
kep
on
talking
if
you
want
a
he
says
you
know
where
to
come
reasonable
with
them
as
is
reasonable
thursday
night
he
says
and
then
he
slung
his
hook
round
the
corner
a
shiner
inquired
bob
looking
from
under
his
eyebrows
i
did
know
myself
just
then
but
i
found
out
it
a
pewter
see
a
flash
of
intelligence
shot
across
bob
face
when
pennyloaf
returned
she
found
her
husband
with
his
box
of
moulds
and
medals
on
the
table
he
was
turning
over
its
contents
meditatively
on
the
table
there
also
lay
a
half
crown
and
a
florin
as
though
bob
had
been
examining
these
products
of
the
royal
mint
with
a
view
to
improving
the
artistic
quality
of
his
amateur
workmanship
he
took
up
the
coins
quietly
as
his
wife
entered
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
rendal
been
at
me
again
bob
pennyloaf
said
as
she
set
down
her
have
to
give
her
something
he
paid
no
attention
and
pennyloaf
had
a
difficulty
in
bringing
him
to
discuss
the
subject
of
the
landlady
demands
ultimately
however
he
admitted
with
discontent
the
advisability
of
letting
rendal
have
something
on
account
though
it
was
saturday
night
he
let
hour
after
hour
go
by
and
showed
no
disposition
to
leave
home
to
surprise
he
sat
almost
without
moving
by
the
fire
absorbed
in
thought
genuine
respect
for
law
is
the
result
of
possessing
something
which
the
law
exerts
itself
to
guard
should
it
happen
that
you
possess
nothing
and
that
your
education
in
metaphysics
has
been
grievously
neglected
the
strong
probability
is
that
your
mind
will
reduce
the
principle
of
society
to
its
naked
formula
get
by
whatever
means
so
long
as
with
impunity
on
that
formula
bob
hewett
was
brooding
in
the
hours
of
this
saturday
evening
he
exerted
his
mind
more
strenuously
than
ever
before
in
the
course
of
his
life
and
to
a
foregone
result
here
is
a
man
with
no
moral
convictions
with
no
conscious
relations
to
society
save
those
which
are
hostile
with
no
personal
affections
at
the
same
time
vaguely
aware
of
certain
faculties
in
himself
for
which
life
affords
no
scope
and
encouraged
in
various
kinds
of
conceit
by
the
crass
stupidity
of
all
with
whom
he
associates
it
is
suggested
to
him
all
at
once
that
there
is
a
very
easy
way
of
improving
his
circumstances
and
that
by
exercise
of
a
certain
craft
with
which
he
is
perfectly
familiar
only
the
method
happens
to
be
criminal
who
do
this
kind
of
thing
are
constantly
being
caught
and
severely
punished
yes
men
of
a
certain
kind
not
robert
hewett
robert
hewett
is
altogether
an
exceptional
being
he
is
head
and
shoulders
above
the
men
with
whom
he
mixes
he
is
clever
he
is
remarkably
if
anyone
in
this
world
of
a
truth
robert
hewett
may
reckon
on
impunity
when
he
sets
his
wits
against
the
law
why
his
arrest
and
punishment
is
an
altogether
inconceivable
thing
he
never
in
his
life
had
a
charge
brought
against
him
again
and
again
it
came
back
to
that
every
novice
in
unimpassioned
crime
has
that
thought
and
the
more
the
man
the
more
impressed
with
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
so
much
the
weightier
is
its
effect
with
him
we
know
in
what
spirit
john
hewett
regarded
rebels
against
the
law
do
not
imagine
that
any
impulse
of
that
nature
actuated
his
son
clara
alone
had
inherited
her
father
instinct
of
revolt
bob
temperament
was
in
a
certain
measure
that
of
the
artist
he
felt
without
reasoning
he
let
himself
go
whither
his
moods
propelled
him
not
a
man
of
evil
propensities
entertain
no
such
thought
for
a
moment
society
produces
many
a
monster
but
the
mass
of
those
whom
after
creating
them
it
pronounces
bad
are
merely
bad
from
the
conventional
point
of
view
they
are
guilty
of
weaknesses
not
of
crimes
bob
was
not
incapable
of
generosity
his
marriage
had
in
fact
implied
more
of
that
quality
than
you
in
the
upper
world
can
at
all
appreciate
he
neglected
his
wife
of
course
for
he
had
never
loved
her
and
the
burden
of
her
support
was
too
great
a
trial
for
his
selfishness
weakness
vanity
a
sense
that
he
has
not
satisfactions
proportionate
to
his
desert
a
strong
temptation
here
are
the
data
which
in
ordinary
cases
explain
a
man
deliberate
attempt
to
profit
by
criminality
in
a
short
time
pennyloaf
began
to
be
aware
of
peculiarities
of
behaviour
in
her
husband
for
which
she
could
not
account
though
there
appeared
no
necessity
for
the
step
he
insisted
on
their
once
more
seeking
new
lodgings
and
before
the
removal
he
destroyed
all
his
medals
and
moulds
that
for
bob
pennyloaf
inquired
tell
you
and
mind
you
hold
your
tongue
about
it
somebody
been
saying
as
these
things
might
get
me
into
trouble
just
you
be
careful
not
to
mention
to
people
that
i
used
to
make
these
kind
of
things
why
should
it
get
you
into
trouble
what
i
tell
you
and
do
ask
questions
you
always
too
ready
at
talking
his
absences
of
an
evening
were
nothing
new
but
his
manner
on
returning
was
such
as
pennyloaf
had
never
seen
in
him
he
appeared
to
be
suffering
from
some
intense
excitement
his
hands
were
unsteady
he
showed
the
strangest
nervousness
if
there
were
any
unusual
sounds
in
the
house
then
he
certainly
obtained
money
of
which
his
wife
did
not
know
the
source
he
bought
new
articles
of
clothing
and
in
explanation
said
that
he
had
won
bets
pennyloaf
remarked
these
things
with
uneasiness
she
had
a
fear
during
her
lonely
evenings
for
which
she
could
give
no
reason
poor
slowwitted
mortal
though
she
was
a
devoted
fidelity
attached
her
to
her
husband
and
quickened
wonderfully
her
apprehension
in
everything
that
concerned
him
snowdon
came
bob
she
had
said
about
a
week
after
his
order
with
regard
to
jane
she
did
and
did
you
tell
her
she
better
keep
away
was
the
dispirited
answer
to
hear
it
as
for
jack
bartley
he
never
showed
himself
at
the
new
lodgings
bob
shortly
became
less
regular
in
his
attendance
at
the
workshop
an
occasional
monday
he
had
to
be
sure
been
in
the
habit
of
allowing
himself
but
as
the
winter
wore
on
he
was
more
than
once
found
straying
about
the
streets
in
midweek
one
morning
towards
the
end
of
november
as
he
strolled
along
high
holborn
a
hand
checked
his
progress
he
gave
almost
a
leap
and
turned
a
face
of
terror
upon
the
person
who
stopped
him
it
was
clem
snowdon
they
had
of
course
met
casually
since
bob
marriage
and
in
progress
of
time
the
ferocious
glances
they
were
wont
to
exchange
had
softened
into
a
grin
of
recognition
clem
behaviour
at
present
was
an
unexpected
revival
of
familiarity
when
he
had
got
over
his
shock
bob
felt
surprised
and
expressed
the
feeling
in
a
what
have
got
to
say
for
yourself
jumped
as
if
i
stuck
a
pin
in
you
replied
clem
you
think
it
was
a
copper
bob
looked
at
her
with
a
surly
smile
though
no
one
could
have
mistaken
the
class
she
belonged
to
clem
was
dressed
in
a
way
which
made
her
companionship
with
bob
in
his
workman
clothing
somewhat
incongruous
she
wore
a
heavily
trimmed
brown
hat
a
long
velveteen
jacket
and
carried
a
little
bag
of
imitation
fur
ai
you
at
work
she
added
pennyloaf
hewett
know
how
you
spend
your
time
your
husband
taught
you
to
mind
your
own
business
clem
took
the
retort
and
they
walked
on
conversing
not
altogether
at
his
ease
thus
companioned
bob
turned
out
of
the
main
street
and
presently
they
came
within
sight
of
the
british
museum
been
in
that
place
clem
asked
course
i
have
he
replied
with
his
air
of
superiority
have
is
there
anything
to
pay
let
go
in
for
half
an
hour
it
was
an
odd
freak
but
bob
began
to
have
a
pleasure
in
this
renewal
of
intimacy
he
wished
he
had
been
wearing
his
best
suit
years
ago
his
father
had
brought
him
on
a
public
holiday
to
the
museum
and
his
interest
was
chiefly
excited
by
the
collection
of
the
royal
seals
to
that
quarter
he
first
led
his
companion
and
thence
directed
her
towards
objects
more
likely
to
supply
her
with
amusement
he
talked
freely
and
was
himself
surprised
at
the
show
of
information
his
memory
allowed
him
to
make
desperately
vague
and
often
ludicrously
wide
of
the
mark
but
still
a
something
of
knowledge
retained
from
all
sorts
of
chance
encounters
by
his
capable
mind
had
the
british
museum
been
open
to
visitors
in
the
hours
of
the
evening
or
on
sundays
bob
hewitt
would
possibly
have
been
employing
his
leisure
nowadays
in
more
profitable
pursuits
possibly
one
can
not
say
more
than
that
for
the
world
to
which
he
belonged
is
above
all
a
world
of
frustration
and
only

bob
glared
at
her
and
clem
laughed
showing
all
her
teeth
from
this
exchange
of
pleasantries
the
talk
passed
to

pause

if

and
they
left
the
building
together
at
the
end
of

they
exchanged
a
careless
nod
and
went
their
several
ways
chapter
xxv
a
double
consecration
bessie
byass
and
her
husband
had
as
you
may
suppose
devoted
many
an
hour
to
intimate
gossip
on
the
affairs
of
their
lodgers
having
no
relations
with
clerkenwell
close
they
did
not
even
hear
the
rumours
which
spread
from
peckover
house
at
the
time
of
departure
thence
their
curiosity
which
only
grew
keener
as
time
went
on
found
no
appeasement
save
in
conjecture
that
sidney
kirkwood
was
in
the
secret
from
the
first
they
had
no
doubt
bessie
made
a
sly
attempt
now
and
then
to
get
a
hint
from
him
but
without
the
least
result
the
appearance
on
the
scene
of
jane
father
revived
their
speculation
and
just
after
the
old
man
illness
in
the
month
of
august
occurred
something
which
gave
them
still
fresh
matter
for
argument
the
rooms
on
the
first
floor
having
become
vacant
michael
proposed
certain
new
arrangements
his
own
chamber
was
too
much
that
of
an
invalid
to
serve
any
longer
as
for
jane
he
desired
to
take
the
front
room
below
for
that
purpose
to
make
the
other
on
the
same
floor
jane
and
then
to
share
with
the
byasses
the
expense
of
keeping
a
servant
whose
lodging
would
be
in
the
chamber
thus
set
free
hitherto
bessie
and
jane
and
an
occasional
charwoman
had
done
all
the
work
of
the
house
it
was
a
day
of
jubilation
for
byass
when
she
found
herself
ruling
over
a
capped
and
aproned
maid
all
these
things
set
it
beyond
doubt
that
michael
snowdon
had
means
greater
than
one
would
have
supposed
from
his
way
of
living
hitherto
removal
from
work
could
of
course
be
explained
by
her
growing
infirmities
but
bessie
saw
more
than
this
in
the
new
order
of
things
she
began
to
look
upon
the
girl
with
a
certain
awe
as
one
whose
future
might
reveal
marvels
for
jane
as
we
know
the
marvels
had
already
begun
she
came
back
from
danbury
not
altogether
like
herself
unsettled
a
little
as
it
appeared
and
michael
illness
befalling
so
soon
brought
her
into
a
nervous
state
such
as
she
had
not
known
for
a
long
time
the
immediate
effect
of
the
disclosure
made
to
her
by
michael
whilst
he
was
recovering
was
to
overwhelm
her
with
a
sense
of
responsibilities
to
throw
her
mind
into
painful
tumult
slow
of
thought
habituated
to
the
simplest
views
of
her
own
existence
very
ignorant
of
the
world
beyond
the
little
circle
in
which
her
life
had
been
passed
she
could
not
at
once
bring
into
the
control
of
her
reflection
this
wondrous
future
to
which
her
eyes
had
been
opened
the
way
in
which
she
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
facts
was
unfortunate
michael
snowdon
in
spite
of
his
deep
affection
for
her
and
of
the
trust
he
had
come
to
repose
in
her
character
did
not
understand
jane
well
enough
to
bring
about
this
revelation
with
the
needful
prudence
between
him
a
man
burdened
with
the
sorrowful
memories
of
a
long
life
originally
of
stern
temperament
and
now
in
the
feebleness
of
his
age
possessed
by
an
enthusiasm
which
in
several
respects
disturbed
his
judgment
which
made
him
desperately
eager
to
secure
his
end
now
that
he
felt
life
slipping
away
from
him
between
him
and
such
a
girl
as
jane
there
was
a
wider
gulf
than
either
of
them
could
be
aware
of
little
as
he
desired
it
he
could
not
help
using
a
tone
which
seemed
severe
rather
than
tenderly
trustful
absorbed
in
his
great
idea
conscious
that
it
had
regulated
every
detail
in
his
treatment
of
jane
since
she
came
to
live
with
him
he
forgot
that
the
girl
herself
was
by
no
means
adequately
prepared
to
receive
the
solemn
injunctions
which
he
now
delivered
to
her
his
language
was
as
general
as
were
the
ideas
of
beneficent
activity
which
he
desired
to
embody
in
jane
future
but
instead
of
inspiring
her
with
his
own
zeal
he
afflicted
her
with
grievous
spiritual
trouble
for
a
time
she
could
only
feel
that
something
great
and
hard
and
high
was
suddenly
required
of
her
the
old
man
look
seemed
to
keep
repeating
you
worthy
the
tremor
of
bygone
days
came
back
upon
her
as
she
listened
the
anguish
of
timidity
the
with
which
she
had
been
wont
to
strain
her
attention
when
peckover
or
clem
imposed
a
harsh
task
one
thing
alone
had
she
grasped
as
soon
as
it
was
uttered
one
word
of
reassurance
she
could
recall
when
she
sat
down
in
solitude
to
collect
her
thoughts
her
grandfather
had
mentioned
that
sidney
kirkwood
already
knew
this
secret
to
sidney
her
whole
being
turned
in
this
hour
of
distress
he
was
the
friend
who
would
help
her
with
counsel
and
teach
her
to
be
strong
but
hereupon
there
revived
in
her
a
trouble
which
for
the
moment
she
had
forgotten
and
it
became
so
acute
that
she
was
driven
to
speak
to
michael
in
a
way
which
had
till
now
seemed
impossible
when
she
entered
his
room
it
was
the
morning
after
their
grave
conversation
michael
welcomed
her
with
a
face
of
joy
which
however
she
still
felt
to
be
somewhat
stern
and
searching
in
its
look
when
they
had
talked
for
a
few
moments
jane
said
may
speak
about
this
to
kirkwood
grandfather
hope
you
will
jane
strangers
need
know
of
it
yet
but
we
can
speak
freely
to
him
after
many
endeavours
to
find
words
that
would
veil
her
thought
she
constrained
herself
to
ask
he
think
i
can
be
all
you
wish
michael
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
has
no
less
faith
in
you
than
i
have
be
sure
of
that
been
thinking
that
perhaps
he
distrusted
me
a
little
my
child
do
quite
know
but
there
been
a
little
difference
in
him
i
think
since
we
came
back
michael
countenance
fell
how
but
jane
could
not
go
further
she
wished
she
had
not
spoken
her
face
began
to
grow
hot
and
she
moved
away
only
your
fancy
continued
michael
may
be
that
you
think
he
is
quite
so
easy
in
his
talking
to
you
as
he
was
fancied
it
but
it
was
only
you
may
be
partly
right
said
her
grandfather
softening
his
voice
jane
i
tell
you
something
i
think
there
no
harm
perhaps
i
ought
to
you
must
know
that
i
had
meant
to
speak
to
sidney
of
these
things
just
when
i
did
it
came
about
because
had
something
to
tell
and
something
i
was
well
pleased
to
hear
it
was
about
you
jane
and
in
that
way
i
got
talking
something
about
you
my
child
afterwards
i
asked
him
whether
he
would
speak
to
you
yourself
but
he
said
no
not
till
you
heard
all
that
was
before
you
i
think
i
understood
him
and
i
dare
say
you
will
if
you
think
it
over
matter
enough
for
thinking
over
in
these
words
did
she
understand
them
aright
before
leaving
the
room
she
had
not
dared
to
look
her
grandfather
in
the
face
but
she
knew
well
that
he
was
regarding
her
still
with
the
same
smile
did
she
understand
him
aright
try
to
read
her
mind
the
world
had
all
at
once
grown
very
large
a
distress
to
her
imagination
worse
still
she
had
herself
become
a
person
of
magnified
importance
irrecognisable
in
her
own
sight
moving
thinking
so
unnaturally
jane
i
assure
you
had
thought
very
little
of
herself
hitherto
in
both
senses
of
the
phrase
joyous
because
she
could
not
help
it
full
of
gratitude
admiration
generosity
she
occupied
her
thoughts
very
much
with
other
people
but
knew
not
knew
not
the
one
thing
affecting
herself
over
which
she
mused
frequently
was
her
suffering
as
a
little
thrall
in
clerkenwell
close
and
the
result
was
to
make
her
very
humble
she
had
been
an
ragged
child
and
something
of
that
degradation
seemed
in
her
feeling
still
to
cling
to
her
could
she
have
known
bob
hewett
view
of
her
position
she
would
have
felt
its
injustice
but
at
the
same
time
would
have
bowed
her
head
and
in
this
spirit
had
she
looked
up
to
sidney
kirkwood
regarding
him
as
when
she
was
a
child
save
for
that
subtle
modification
which
began
on
the
day
when
she
brought
news
of
clara
hewett
disappearance
perfect
in
kindness
sidney
had
never
addressed
a
word
to
her
which
implied
more
than
friendship
never
until
that
evening
at
the
farm
then
for
the
first
time
had
he
struck
a
new
note
his
words
seemed
spoken
with
the
express
purpose
of
altering
his
and
her
relations
to
each
other
so
much
jane
had
felt
and
his
change
since
then
was
all
the
more
painful
to
her
all
the
more
confusing
now
that
of
a
sudden
she
had
to
regard
herself
in
an
entirely
new
way
the
dearest
interest
of
her
life
necessarily
entered
upon
another
phase
struggling
to
understand
how
her
grandfather
could
think
her
worthy
of
such
high
trust
she
inevitably
searched
her
mind
for
testimony
as
to
the
account
in
which
sidney
held
her
a
fearful
hope
had
already
flushed
her
cheeks
before
michael
spoke
the
words
which
surely
could
have
but
one
meaning
on
one
point
sidney
had
left
her
no
doubts
that
his
love
for
clara
hewett
was
a
thing
of
the
past
he
had
told
her
distinctly
and
why
did
he
wish
her
to
be
assured
of
that
oh
had
her
grandfather
been
mistaken
in
those
words
he
reported
durst
she
put
faith
in
them
coming
thus
to
her
by
another
voice
doubts
and
dreads
and
might
still
visit
her
from
hour
to
hour
but
the
instinct
of
joy
would
not
allow
her
to
refuse
admission
to
this
supreme
hope
as
if
in
spite
of
herself
the
former
gladness
nay
a
gladness
multiplied
beyond
conception
reigned
once
more
in
her
heart
her
grandfather
would
not
speak
lightly
in
such
a
matter
as
this
the
meaning
of
his
words
was
confessed
to
all
eternity
immutable
had
it
then
come
to
this
the
friend
to
whom
she
looked
up
with
such
reverence
with
voiceless
gratitude
when
he
condescended
to
speak
kindly
to
the
peckovers
miserable
little
servant
he
after
all
these
changes
and
chances
of
life
sought
her
now
that
she
was
a
woman
and
had
it
on
his
lips
to
say
that
he
loved
her
hitherto
the
impossible
the
silly
thought
to
be
laughed
out
of
her
head
the
desire
for
which
she
would
have
chid
herself
durst
she
have
faced
it
seriously
was
it
become
a
very
truth
a
good
heart
jane
things
be
better
some
day
how
many
years
since
the
rainy
and
windy
night
when
he
threw
his
coat
over
her
and
spoke
those
words
yet
she
could
hear
them
now
and
the
tears
that
rushed
to
her
eyes
as
she
blessed
him
for
his
manly
goodness
were
as
much
those
of
the
desolate
child
as
of
the
woman
and
the
change
that
she
had
observed
in
him
since
that
evening
at
danbury
a
real
change
but
only
of
manner
he
would
not
say
to
her
what
he
had
meant
to
say
until
she
knew
the
truth
about
her
own
circumstances
in
simple
words
she
being
rich
and
he
having
only
what
he
earned
by
his
daily
work
sidney
did
not
think
it
right
to
speak
whilst
she
was
still
in
ignorance
the
delicacy
of
her
instincts
and
the
sympathies
awakened
by
her
affection
made
this
perfectly
clear
to
her
strange
and
difficult
to
grasp
as
the
situation
was
at
first
when
she
understood
how
her
soul
laughed
with
exulting
merriment
consecration
to
a
great
idea
endowment
with
the
means
of
wide
beneficence
this
not
only
left
her
cold
but
weighed
upon
her
afflicted
her
beyond
her
strength
what
was
it
in
truth
that
restored
her
to
herself
and
made
her
heart
beat
joyously
knit
your
brows
against
her
shake
your
head
and
raze
her
name
from
that
catalogue
of
saints
whereon
you
have
inscribed
it
in
anticipation
jane
rejoiced
simply
because
she
loved
a
poor
man
and
had
riches
that
she
could
lay
at
his
feet
great
sums
of
money
vague
and
disturbing
to
her
imagination
when
she
was
bidden
hold
them
in
trust
for
unknown
people
gleamed
and
made
music
now
that
she
could
think
of
them
as
a
gift
of
love
by
this
way
of
thought
she
could
escape
from
the
confusion
in
which
solemn
appeal
had
left
her
exalted
by
her
great
hope
calmed
by
the
assurance
of
aid
that
would
never
fail
her
she
began
to
feel
the
beauty
of
the
task
to
which
she
was
summoned
the
appalling
responsibility
became
a
high
privilege
now
that
it
was
to
be
shared
with
one
in
whose
wisdom
and
strength
she
had
measureless
confidence
she
knew
now
what
wealth
meant
it
was
a
great
and
glorious
power
a
source
of
blessings
incalculable
this
power
it
would
be
hers
to
bestow
and
no
man
more
worthy
than
he
who
should
receive
it
at
her
hands
it
was
not
without
result
that
jane
had
been
so
long
a
listener
to
the
conversations
between
michael
and
kirkwood
defective
as
was
her
instruction
in
the
ordinary
sense
those
evenings
spent
in
the
company
of
the
two
men
had
done
much
to
refine
her
modes
of
thought
in
spite
of
the
humble
powers
of
her
mind
and
her
narrow
experience
she
had
learned
to
think
on
matters
which
are
wholly
strange
to
girls
of
her
station
to
regard
the
life
of
the
world
and
the
individual
in
a
light
of
idealism
and
with
a
freedom
from
ignoble
association
rare
enough
in
any
class
her
forecast
of
the
future
to
be
spent
with
sidney
was
pathetic
in
its
simplicity
but
had
the
stamp
of
nobleness
thinking
of
the
past
years
she
made
clear
to
herself
all
the
significance
of
her
training
in
her
general
view
of
things
wealth
was
naturally
allied
with
education
but
she
understood
why
michael
had
had
her
taught
so
little
a
wealthy
woman
is
called
a
lady
yes
but
that
was
exactly
what
she
was
not
to
become
on
that
account
she
had
gone
to
work
when
in
reality
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
do
so
never
must
she
remove
herself
from
the
poor
and
the
laborious
her
kin
her
care
never
must
she
forget
those
bitter
sufferings
of
her
childhood
precious
as
enabling
her
to
comprehend
the
misery
of
others
for
whom
had
come
no
rescue
she
saw
moreover
what
was
meant
by
michael
religious
teaching
why
he
chose
for
her
study
such
parts
of
the
bible
as
taught
the
beauty
of
compassion
of
service
rendered
to
those
whom
the
world
casts
forth
and
leaves
to
perish
all
this
grew
upon
her
when
once
the
gladness
of
her
heart
was
revived
it
was
of
the
essence
of
her
being
to
exercise
all
human
and
virtues
and
the
consecration
to
a
life
of
beneficence
moved
her
profoundly
now
that
it
followed
upon
consecration
to
the
warmer
love
when
sidney
paid
his
next
visit
jane
was
alone
in
the
new
her
grandfather
said
he
did
not
feel
well
enough
to
come
down
this
evening
it
was
the
first
time
that
kirkwood
had
seen
the
new
room
after
making
his
inquiries
about
michael
he
surveyed
the
arrangements
which
were
as
simple
as
they
could
be
and
spoke
a
few
words
regarding
the
comfort
jane
would
find
in
them
he
had
his
hand
on
a
chair
but
did
not
sit
down
nor
lay
aside
his
hat
jane
suffered
from
a
constraint
which
she
had
never
before
felt
in
his
presence
know
what
grandfather
has
been
telling
me
she
said
at
length
regarding
him
with
grave
eyes
he
told
me
of
his
intention
asked
him
if
i
might
speak
to
you
about
it
it
was
hard
to
understand
at
first
would
be
i
no
doubt
jane
moved
a
little
took
up
some
sewing
and
seated
herself
sidney
let
his
hat
drop
on
to
the
chair
but
remained
standing
his
arms
resting
on
the
back
a
very
short
time
since
i
myself
knew
of
it
he
continued
then
i
as
little
imagined
as
you
did
that
he
paused
then
resumed
more
quickly
it
explains
many
things
which
i
had
always
understood
in
a
simpler
way
feel
too
that
i
know
grandfather
much
better
than
i
did
jane
said
always
been
thinking
about
the
time
when
i
should
be
old
enough
to
hear
what
plans
he
made
for
me
i
do
so
hope
he
really
trusts
me
kirkwood
i
do
know
whether
i
speak
about
it
as
he
wishes
it
is
easy
to
say
all
i
think
but
i
mean
to
do
my
best
to
be
what
he
knows
that
very
well
do
be
anxious
he
feels
that
all
his
hopes
have
been
realised
in
you
there
was
silence
jane
made
a
pretence
of
using
her
needle
and
sidney
watched
her
hands
spoke
to
you
of
a
lady
called
mrs
lant
were
his
next
words
he
just
mentioned
her
you
going
to
see
her
soon
do
know
have
seen
her
but
i
believe
she
a
woman
you
could
soon
be
friendly
with
i
hope
your
grandfather
will
ask
her
to
come
here
before
long
rather
afraid
of
strangers
doubt
said
the
other
smiling
you
get
over
that
i
shall
do
my
best
to
persuade
snowdon
to
make
you
acquainted
with
her
jane
drew
in
her
breath
uneasily
wo
want
me
to
know
other
people
i
hope
if
she
does
they
be
kind
and
nice
and
easy
to
talk
to
jane
raised
her
eyes
and
said
feel
as
if
i
was
very
childish
and
that
makes
me
feel
it
still
more
of
course
if
it
necessary
i
do
my
best
to
talk
to
strangers
but
they
wo
expect
too
much
of
me
at
first
i
mean
if
they
find
me
a
little
slow
they
wo
be
impatient
must
think
that
hard
things
are
going
to
be
asked
of
you
you
never
be
required
to
say
or
do
anything
that
you
have
already
said
and
done
many
a
time
quite
naturally
why
it
some
time
since
you
began
the
kind
of
work
of
which
your
grandfather
has
been
speaking
have
begun
it
how
has
been
such
a
good
friend
to
pennyloaf
and
helped
her
as
nobody
else
could
have
done
but
that
nothing
sidney
was
on
the
point
of
replying
but
suddenly
altered
his
intention
he
raised
himself
from
the
leaning
attitude
and
took
his
hat
we
talk
about
it
another
time
he
said
carelessly
stop
long
so
i
go
up
and
see
your
grandfather
jane
rose
silently
just
look
in
and
say
before
i
go
sidney
added
as
he
left
the
room
he
did
so
twenty
minutes
after
when
he
opened
the
door
jane
was
sewing
busily
but
it
was
only
on
hearing
his
footsteps
that
she
had
so
applied
herself
he
gave
a
friendly
nod
and
departed
still
the
same
change
in
his
manner
a
little
while
ago
he
would
have
chatted
freely
and
forgotten
the
time
another
week
and
jane
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
lady
whose
name
we
have
once
or
twice
heard
miss
lant
the
friend
of
old
percival
of
middle
age
and
with
very
plain
features
miss
lant
had
devoted
herself
to
philanthropic
work
she
had
an
income
of
a
few
hundred
pounds
and
lived
almost
as
simply
as
the
snowdons
in
order
to
save
money
for
charitable
expenditure
unfortunately
the
earlier
years
of
her
life
had
been
joyless
and
in
the
energy
which
she
brought
to
this
enterprise
there
was
just
a
touch
of
excess
common
enough
in
those
who
have
been
defrauded
of
their
natural
satisfactions
and
find
a
resource
in
altruism
she
was
no
pietist
but
there
is
nowadays
coming
into
existence
a
class
of
persons
who
substitute
for
the
old
religious
acerbity
a
narrow
and
oppressive
zeal
for
good
works
of
purely
human
sanction
and
to
this
order
miss
lant
might
be
said
to
belong
however
nothing
but
what
was
agreeable
manifested
itself
in
her
intercourse
with
michael
and
jane
the
former
found
her
ardent
spirit
very
congenial
and
the
latter
was
soon
at
ease
in
her
company
it
was
a
keen
distress
to
jane
when
she
heard
from
pennyloaf
that
bob
would
allow
no
future
meetings
between
them
in
vain
she
sought
an
explanation
pennyloaf
professed
to
know
nothing
of
her
motives
but
implored
her
friend
to
keep
away
for
a
time
as
any
disregard
of
bob
injunction
would
only
result
in
worse
troubles
than
she
yet
had
to
endure
jane
sought
the
aid
of
kirkwood
begging
him
to
interfere
with
young
hewett
the
attempt
was
made
but
proved
fruitless
volo
sic
was
bob
standpoint
and
he
as
good
as
bade
sidney
mind
his
own
affairs
jane
suffered
and
more
than
she
herself
would
have
anticipated
she
had
conceived
a
liking
almost
an
affection
for
poor
shiftless
pennyloaf
strengthened
of
course
by
the
devotion
with
which
the
latter
repaid
her
but
something
more
than
this
injury
to
her
feelings
was
involved
in
her
distress
on
being
excluded
from
those
sorry
lodgings
pennyloaf
was
comparatively
an
old
friend
she
represented
the
past
its
contented
work
its
familiar
associations
its
abundant
happiness
and
now
though
jane
did
not
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
regretted
the
old
state
of
things
still
less
that
she
feared
the
future
it
was
undeniable
that
the
past
seemed
very
bright
in
her
memory
and
that
something
weighed
upon
her
heart
forbidding
such
gladsomeness
as
she
had
known
chapter

sidney
struggle
in
the
dreary
days
when
autumn
is
being
choked
by
the
first
fogs
sidney
kirkwood
had
to
bestir
himself
and
to
find
new
lodgings
the
cheerless
task
came
upon
him
just
when
he
had
already
more
than
sufficient
trouble
and
to
tear
himself
out
of
the
abode
in
which
he
had
spent
eight
years
caused
him
more
than
regret
he
felt
superstitiously
about
it
and
questioned
fate
as
to
what
sorrows
might
be
lurking
for
him
behind
this
corner
in
life
journey
move
he
must
his
landlady
was
dead
and
the
house
would
perhaps
be
vacant
for
a
long
time
after
making
search
about
islington
one
rainy
evening
he
found
himself
at
the
end
of
hanover
street
and
was
drawn
to
the
familiar
house
not
however
to
visit
the
snowdons
but
to
redeem
a
promise
recently
made
to
bessie
byass
who
declared
herself
vastly
indignant
at
the
neglect
with
which
he
treated
her
so
instead
of
going
up
the
steps
to
the
front
door
he
descended
into
the
area
bessie
herself
opened
to
him
and
after
a
shrewd
glance
made
as
though
she
would
close
the
door
again
for
you
the
idea
of
beggars
coming
down
the
be
off
worse
than
a
beggar
replied
sidney
more
in
my
line
and
he
attempted
to
force
an
entrance
bessie
struggled
but
had
to
give
in
overcome
with
laughter
samuel
was
enjoying
a
pipe
in
the
front
kitchen
in
spite
of
the
dignity
of
keeping
a
servant
to
whom
the
back
kitchen
was
sacred
and
byass
frequently
spent
their
evenings
below
stairs
in
the
same
manner
as
of
old
the
talk
began
with
sidney
immediate
difficulties
if
it
had
only
happened
half
a
year
ago
said
bessie
should
have
got
you
into
our
rooms
wonder
if
we
have
him
there
yet
some
day
remarked
sam
winking
at
his
wife
him
was
bessie
rejoinder
with
a
meaning
smile
a
cool
hand
is
kirkwood
he
knows
how
to
wait
when
happens
we
shall
have
him
taking
a
house
out
at
highbury
you
see
if
he
do
sidney
turned
upon
her
with
anything
but
a
jesting
look
do
you
mean
by
that
mrs
byass
he
asked
sharply
happens
what
are
you
hinting
at
us
and
save
us
cried
bessie
sam
he
going
to
swallow
me
what
harm
have
i
done
tell
me
what
you
meant
sidney
urged
his
face
expressing
strong
annoyance
do
you
call
me
a
cool
hand
and
say
that
i
know
how
to
wait
what
did
you
mean
i
serious
i
want
you
to
explain
whilst
he
was
speaking
there
came
a
knock
at
the
kitchen
door
bessie
cried
in
and
jane
showed
herself
she
glanced
in
a
startled
way
at
sidney
murmured
a
to
him
and
made
a
request
of
bessie
for
some
trifle
she
needed
sidney
after
just
looking
round
kept
his
seat
and
paid
no
further
attention
to
jane
who
speedily
retired
silence
followed
and
in
the
midst
of
it
kirkwood
pushed
his
chair
impatiently
cried
samuel
with
an
affected
jocoseness
called
upon
to
apologise
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
again
do
see
why
he
need
be
so
snappish
with
me
replied
his
wife
beg
his
pardon
if
he
wants
me
but
sidney
was
laughing
now
though
not
in
a
very
natural
way
he
put
an
end
to
the
incident
and
led
off
into
talk
of
quite
a
different
kind
when
was
at
hand
he
declared
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
stay
the
hour
had
been
anything
but
a
lively
one
and
when
he
was
gone
his
friends
discussed
at
length
this
novel
display
of
on
sidney
part
he
went
home
muttering
to
himself
and
passed
as
bad
a
night
as
he
had
ever
known
two
days
later
his
removal
to
new
lodgings
was
effected
notwithstanding
his
desire
to
get
into
a
cleaner
region
he
had
taken
a
room
at
the
top
of
a
house
in
red
lion
street
in
the
densest
part
of
clerkenwell
where
his
neighbours
under
the
same
roof
were
craftsmen
carrying
on
their
business
at
home
do
well
enough
just
for
a
time
he
said
to
himself
can
say
when
i
shall
be
really
settled
again
or
whether
i
ever
shall
midway
in
an
attempt
to
put
his
things
in
order
to
nail
his
pictures
on
the
walls
and
ring
forth
his
books
again
he
was
seized
with
such
utter
discouragement
that
he
let
a
volume
drop
from
his
hand
and
threw
himself
into
a
seat
a
moan
escaped
his
lips
cursed
money
ever
since
the
disclosure
made
to
him
by
michael
snowdon
at
danbury
he
had
been
sensible
of
a
grave
uneasiness
respecting
his
relations
with
jane
at
the
moment
he
might
imagine
himself
to
share
the
old
enthusiasm
or
dream
or
craze
whichever
name
were
the
most
appropriate
but
not
an
hour
had
passed
before
he
began
to
lament
that
such
a
romance
as
this
should
envelop
the
life
which
had
so
linked
itself
with
his
own
immediately
there
arose
in
him
a
struggle
between
the
idealist
tendency
of
which
he
had
his
share
and
stubborn
everyday
sense
supported
by
his
knowledge
of
the
world
and
of
his
own
being
a
struggle
to
continue
for
months
thwarting
the
natural
current
of
his
life
racking
his
intellect
embittering
his
heart
truest
emotions
conscious
of
mystery
in
snowdon
affairs
he
had
never
dreamed
of
such
a
solution
as
this
the
probability
was
so
he
had
thought
that
michael
received
an
annuity
under
the
will
of
his
son
who
died
in
australia
no
word
of
the
old
man
had
ever
hinted
at
wealth
in
his
possession
the
complaints
he
frequently
made
of
the
ill
use
to
which
wealthy
people
put
their
means
seemed
to
imply
a
regret
that
he
with
his
purer
purposes
had
no
power
of
doing
anything
there
was
no
explaining
the
manner
of
jane
if
it
were
not
necessary
that
she
should
be
able
to
support
herself
the
idea
on
which
michael
acted
was
not
such
as
would
suggest
itself
even
to
sidney
mind
deliberately
to
withhold
education
from
a
girl
who
was
to
inherit
any
property
worth
speaking
of
would
be
acting
with
such
boldness
of
originality
that
sidney
could
not
seriously
have
attributed
it
to
his
friend
in
fact
he
did
not
know
michael
until
the
revelation
was
made
the
depths
of
the
man
character
escaped
him
the
struggle
went
all
against
idealism
it
was
a
noble
vision
that
of
michael
but
too
certainly
jane
snowdon
was
not
the
person
to
make
it
a
reality
the
fearful
danger
was
that
all
the
possibilities
of
her
life
might
be
sacrificed
to
a
vain
conscientiousness
her
character
was
full
of
purity
and
sweetness
and
warmth
but
it
had
not
the
strength
necessary
for
the
carrying
out
of
a
purpose
beset
with
difficulties
and
perils
michael
it
was
true
appeared
to
be
aware
of
this
it
did
not
however
gravely
disturb
him
and
for
the
simple
reason
that
not
to
jane
alone
did
he
look
for
the
completion
of
his
design
destiny
had
brought
him
aid
such
as
he
could
never
have
anticipated
jane
helpmate
was
at
hand
in
whom
his
trust
was
unbounded
what
was
in
his
way
that
sidney
should
not
accept
the
responsibility
conscience
from
the
first
whispered
against
his
doing
so
and
the
whisper
was
grown
to
so
loud
a
voice
that
not
an
adverse
argument
could
get
effective
hearing
temptations
lurked
for
him
and
sprang
out
in
moments
of
his
weakness
but
as
temptations
they
were
at
once
recognised
had
gone
too
far
to
retire
he
would
be
guilty
of
sheer
treachery
to
jane
he
would
break
the
old
man
heart
all
which
meant
merely
that
he
loved
the
girl
and
that
it
would
be
like
death
to
part
from
her
but
why
part
what
had
conscience
got
hold
of
that
it
made
all
this
clamour
oh
it
was
simple
enough
sidney
not
only
had
no
faith
in
the
practicability
of
such
a
life
work
as
michael
visioned
but
he
had
the
profoundest
distrust
of
his
own
moral
strength
if
he
should
allow
himself
to
be
committed
to
lifelong
renunciation
am
no
hero
he
said
enthusiast
the
time
when
my
whole
being
could
be
stirred
by
social
questions
has
gone
by
i
am
a
man
in
love
and
in
proportion
as
my
love
has
strengthened
so
has
my
old
revived
in
me
until
now
i
can
imagine
no
bliss
so
perfect
as
to
marry
jane
snowdon
and
go
off
to
live
with
her
amid
fields
and
trees
where
no
echo
of
the
suffering
world
should
ever
reach
us
to
confess
this
was
to
make
it
terribly
certain
that
sooner
or
later
the
burden
of
conscientiousness
would
become
intolerable
not
from
jane
would
support
come
in
that
event
she
poor
child
i
would
fall
into
miserable
perplexity
in
conflict
between
love
and
duty
and
her
life
would
be
ruined
of
course
a
man
might
have
said
matter
how
things
arrange
themselves
when
michael
is
past
knowledge
of
them
i
will
marry
the
woman
i
honestly
desire
and
together
we
will
carry
out
this
humanitarian
project
so
long
as
it
be
possible
when
it
ceases
to
be
so
well
but
sidney
could
not
take
that
view
it
shamed
him
beyond
endurance
to
think
that
he
must
ever
avoid
jane
look
because
he
had
proved
himself
dishonest
and
what
were
worse
had
tempted
her
to
become
so
the
conflict
between
desire
and
scruple
made
every
day
a
weariness
instead
of
looking
forward
eagerly
to
the
evening
in
the
week
which
he
spent
with
michael
and
jane
he
dreaded
its
approach
scarcely
had
he
met
jane
look
since
this
trouble
began
he
knew
that
her
voice
when
she
spoke
to
him
expressed
consciousness
of
something
new
in
their
relations
and
even
whilst
continuing
to
act
his
part
he
suffered
ceaselessly
had
michael
ever
repeated
to
his
granddaughter
the
confession
which
sidney
would
now
have
given
anything
to
recall
it
was
more
than
possible
of
jane
feeling
sidney
could
not
entertain
a
serious
doubt
and
he
knew
that
for
a
long
time
he
had
done
his
best
to
encourage
it
it
was
unpardonable
to
draw
aloof
from
her
just
because
these
circumstances
had
declared
themselves
circumstances
which
brought
perplexity
into
her
life
and
doubtless
made
her
long
for
another
kind
of
support
than
michael
could
afford
her
the
old
man
himself
appeared
to
be
waiting
anxiously
he
had
fallen
back
into
his
habit
of
long
silences
and
often
regarded
sidney
in
a
way
which
the
latter
only
too
well
understood
he
tried
to
help
himself
through
the
time
of
indecision
by
saying
that
there
was
no
hurry
jane
was
very
young
and
with
the
new
order
of
things
her
life
had
in
truth
only
just
begun
she
must
have
a
space
to
look
about
her
all
the
better
if
she
could
form
various
acquaintances
on
that
account
he
urged
so
strongly
that
she
should
be
brought
into
relation
with
miss
lant
and
if
possible
with
certain
of
miss
friends
all
very
well
had
not
the
reasoning
been
utterly
insincere
it
might
have
applied
to
another
person
in
jane
case
it
was
mere
sophistry
her
nature
was
to
force
her
into
alliance
with
conscious
philanthropists
was
to
set
her
in
the
falsest
position
conceivable
striving
to
mould
herself
to
the
desires
of
those
she
loved
she
would
suffer
patiently
and
in
secret
mourn
for
the
time
when
she
had
been
obscure
and
happy
these
things
sidney
knew
with
a
certainty
only
less
than
that
wherewith
he
judged
his
own
sensations
between
jane
and
himself
the
sympathy
was
perfect
and
in
despite
of
scruple
he
would
before
long
have
obeyed
the
natural
impulse
of
his
heart
had
it
not
been
that
still
graver
complications
declared
themselves
and
by
exasperating
his
pride
made
him
reckless
of
the
pain
he
gave
to
others
so
long
as
his
own
was
made
sufficiently
acute
with
joseph
snowdon
he
was
doing
his
best
to
be
on
genial
terms
but
the
task
was
a
hard
one
the
more
he
saw
of
joseph
the
less
he
liked
him
of
late
the
filter
manufacturer
had
begun
to
strike
notes
in
his
conversation
which
jarred
on
sidney
sensibilities
and
made
him
disagreeably
suspicious
that
something
more
was
meant
than
joseph
cared
to
put
into
plain
speech
since
his
establishment
in
business
joseph
had
become
remarkably
attentive
to
his
father
he
appeared
to
enter
with
much
zeal
into
all
that
concerned
jane
he
conversed
privately
with
the
old
man
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
a
time
and
these
dialogues
for
some
reason
or
other
he
made
a
point
of
reporting
to
sidney
according
to
these
reports
and
sidney
did
not
wholly
discredit
them
michael
was
coming
to
have
a
far
better
opinion
of
his
son
than
formerly
was
even
disposed
to
speak
with
him
gravely
of
his
dearest
interests
talked
no
end
about
you
sidney
last
night
said
joseph
on
one
occasion
with
the
smile
whereby
he
meant
to
express
the
last
degree
of
friendly
intelligence
and
sidney
though
anxiously
desiring
to
know
the
gist
of
the
conversation
in
this
instance
was
not
gratified
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
put
questions
and
went
away
in
a
mood
of
vague
annoyance
which
joseph
had
the
especial
power
of
exciting
with
the
byasses
joseph
was
forming
an
intimacy
of
this
too
sidney
became
aware
and
it
irritated
him
the
exact
source
of
this
irritation
he
did
not
at
first
recognise
but
it
was
disclosed
at
length
unmistakably
enough
and
that
on
the
occasion
of
the
visit
recently
described
bessie
pleasantry
which
roused
him
in
so
unwonted
a
manner
could
bear
of
course
but
one
meaning
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
sidney
saw
as
in
a
flash
that
one
remaining
aspect
of
his
position
which
had
not
as
yet
attracted
his
concern
the
byasses
had
learnt
or
had
been
put
in
the
way
of
surmising
that
michael
snowdon
was
wealthy
instantly
they
passed
to
the
reflection
that
in
marrying
jane
their
old
acquaintance
would
be
doing
an
excellent
stroke
of
business
they
were
and
bessie
could
even
venture
to
jest
with
him
on
this
detestable
view
of
his
projects
but
was
it
not
very
likely
that
they
derived
their
information
from
joseph
snowdon
and
if
so
was
it
not
all
but
certain
that
joseph
had
suggested
to
them
this
way
of
regarding
sidney
himself
so
when
jane
face
appeared
at
the
door
he
held
himself
in
stubborn
disregard
of
her
a
thing
impossible
to
him
he
would
have
said
a
few
minutes
ago
he
revenged
himself
upon
jane
good
in
this
way
he
was
likely
to
make
noble
advances
the
next
evening
he
was
due
at
the
snowdons
and
for
the
very
first
time
he
voluntarily
kept
away
he
posted
a
note
to
say
that
the
business
of
his
removal
had
made
him
irregular
he
would
come
next
week
when
things
were
settled
once
more
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
he
sat
wretchedly
in
his
unfamiliar
room
and
groaned
about
accursed
money
his
only
relief
was
in
bursts
of
anger
why
had
he
not
the
courage
to
go
to
michael
and
say
plainly
what
he
thought
have
formed
a
wild
scheme
the
project
of
a
fanatic
its
realisation
would
be
a
miracle
and
in
your
heart
you
must
know
that
jane
character
contains
no
miraculous
possibilities
you
are
playing
with
people
lives
as
fanatics
always
do
for
heaven
sake
bestow
your
money
on
the
practical
folks
who
make
a
solid
business
of
relieving
distress
jane
i
know
will
bless
you
for
making
her
as
poor
as
ever
things
are
going
on
about
you
which
you
do
not
suspect
your
son
is
plotting
plotting
i
can
see
it
this
money
will
be
the
cause
of
endless
suffering
to
those
you
really
love
and
will
never
be
of
as
much
benefit
to
the
unknown
as
if
practical
people
dealt
with
it
jane
is
a
simple
girl
of
infinite
goodness
what
possesses
you
that
you
want
to
make
her
an
impossible
sort
of
social
saint
too
hard
to
speak
thus
frankly
michael
had
no
longer
the
mental
pliancy
of
even
six
months
ago
his
was
everything
to
him
as
he
became
weaker
it
would
gain
the
dire
force
of
an
hallucination
and
in
the
meantime
he
sidney
must
submit
to
be
slandered
by
that
fellow
who
had
his
own
ends
to
gain
to
marry
jane
and
at
the
old
man
death
resign
every
farthing
of
the
money
to
her
trustees
for
charitable
uses
but
the
old
pang
of
conscience
the
wound
to
jane
tender
heart
a
day
of
headache
and
incapacity
during
which
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
attend
to
his
mechanical
work
and
again
the
miserable
loneliness
of
his
attic
it
rained
it
rained
he
had
half
a
mind
to
seek
refuge
at
some
theatre
but
the
energy
to
walk
so
far
was
lacking
and
whilst
he
stood
stupidly
abstracted
there
came
a
knock
at
his
door
thought
i
just
see
if
you
got
straight
said
joseph
snowdon
entering
with
his
genial
smile
sidney
made
no
reply
but
turned
as
if
to
stir
the
fire
hands
in
pockets
joseph
sauntered
to
a
seat
you
be
comfortable
here
he
went
on
well
of
course
it
only
temporary
do
know
about
that
returned
sidney
may
stay
here
as
long
as
i
was
at
the
last
place
eight
years
joseph
laughed
with
exceeding
yes
i
should
wonder
he
said
entering
into
the
joke
becoming
serious
wish
you
found
a
pleasanter
place
with
the
winter
coming
on
you
see
sidney
broke
in
with
splenetic
perversity
do
know
that
i
shall
pass
the
winter
here
my
arrangements
are
all
temporary
all
of
them
after
glancing
at
him
the
other
crossed
his
legs
and
seemed
to
dispose
himself
for
a
stay
of
some
duration
did
turn
up
the
other
night
in
hanover
street
was
there
we
talked
about
you
my
father
has
a
notion
you
been
quite
well
lately
i
dare
say
you
worrying
a
little
eh
sidney
remained
standing
by
the
fireplace
turned
so
that
his
face
was
in
shadow
oh
i
do
know
he
replied
idly
worried
a
good
deal
sidney
and
that
the
fact
about
sorts
of
things
i
meant
to
have
a
long
talk
with
you
but
then
i
do
quite
know
how
to
begin
well
see
it
chiefly
about
jane
sidney
neither
moved
nor
spoke
all
sidney
resumed
the
other
softening
his
voice
her
father
you
see
a
precious
bad
one
i
been
that
there
no
denying
and
dash
it
if
i
do
sometimes
feel
ashamed
of
myself
i
do
when
she
speaks
to
me
in
that
pleasant
way
she
has
you
know
what
i
mean
for
all
that
i
am
her
father
and
i
think
it
only
right
i
should
do
my
best
to
make
her
happy
you
agree
with
that
i
know
i
do
wo
take
it
ill
if
i
ask
whether
in
fact
whether
you
ever
asked
her
you
know
what
i
mean
have
not
sidney
replied
in
a
clear
unmoved
tone
changing
his
position
at
the
same
time
so
as
to
look
his
interlocutor
in
the
face
joseph
seemed
relieved
he
continued
given
her
to
understand
eh
i
suppose
there
no
secret
about
that
often
spoken
to
her
very
intimately
but
i
have
used
no
words
such
as
you
are
thinking
of
it
quite
true
that
my
way
of
behaving
has
meant
more
than
ordinary
friendship
yes
you
not
offended
at
me
bringing
this
subject
up
old
man
you
see
i
her
father
after
all
and
i
think
we
ought
to
understand
each
other
are
quite
right
now
see
he
fidgeted
a
little
my
father
ever
told
you
that
his
friend
the
lawyer
percival
altogether
went
against
that
way
of
bringing
up
jane
i
know
that
do
joseph
paused
before
proceeding
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
much
care
about
percival
i
had
a
talk
with
him
you
know
when
my
business
was
being
settled
no
i
do
quite
take
to
him
so
to
say
now
you
wo
be
offended
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
he
asked
some
rather
queer
questions
about
you
or
at
all
events
if
they
were
exactly
questions
they
they
came
to
the
same
thing
sidney
was
beginning
to
glare
under
his
brows
commonsense
told
him
how
very
unlikely
it
was
that
a
respectable
solicitor
should
compromise
himself
in
talk
with
a
stranger
and
that
such
a
man
as
snowdon
yet
whether
the
story
were
true
or
not
it
meant
that
joseph
was
plotting
in
some
vile
way
and
thus
confirmed
his
suspicions
he
inquired
briefly
and
indifferently
what
percival
insinuations
had
been
i
told
you
i
do
much
care
for
the
fellow
he
did
say
as
much
mind
but
he
seemed
to
be
that
as
jane
father
i
should
do
well
to
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
ha
ha
it
came
to
that
i
thought
though
of
course
i
may
have
been
mistaken
it
shows
how
little
he
knows
about
you
and
father
i
fancy
he
got
it
into
his
head
that
it
was
set
father
on
those
plans
about
jane
though
i
like
to
know
he
paused
sidney
kept
his
eyes
down
and
said
nothing
there
quite
enough
of
that
too
much
still
i
thought
i
tell
you
you
see
it
well
to
know
when
we
got
enemies
behind
our
backs
but
see
sidney
to
speak
seriously
between
ourselves
he
leaned
forward
in
the
confidential
attitude
say
you
gone
just
a
bit
further
than
friendship
with
our
janey
well
i
do
know
a
better
man
and
that
the
truth
but
do
you
think
we
might
put
this
off
for
a
year
or
two
look
now
here
this
lady
miss
lant
taking
up
the
girl
and
it
an
advantage
to
her
you
wo
deny
that
i
sympathise
with
my
good
old
dad
i
do
honestly
but
i
ca
help
thinking
that
janey
in
her
position
ought
to
see
a
little
of
the
world
there
no
secrets
between
you
know
what
she
have
as
well
as
i
do
i
should
be
a
brute
if
i
grudged
it
her
after
all
suffered
from
my
neglect
but
do
you
think
we
might
leave
her
free
for
a
year
or
two
i
agree
with
you
do
i
thought
you
and
i
could
understand
each
other
if
we
only
got
really
talking
look
here
sidney
i
do
mind
just
whispering
to
you
for
anything
i
know
percival
is
saying
disagreeable
things
to
the
old
man
but
do
you
worry
about
that
it
do
matter
a
scrap
you
see
so
long
as
you
and
i
keep
friendly
eh
i
talking
very
open
to
you
but
it
all
for
janey
sake
if
you
went
and
told
father
been
saying
anything
against
percival
well
it
would
make
things
nasty
for
me
i
put
myself
in
your
hands
but
i
know
the
kind
of
man
you
are
it
only
right
you
should
hear
of
what
said
do
worry
just
wait
a
little
that
all
i
mean
it
all
for
the
little
sake
it
would
be
nice
if
you
married
her
and
then
she
was
told
eh
sidney
looked
at
the
speaker
steadily
then
stirred
the
fire
and
moved
about
for
a
few
moments
as
he
kept
absolute
silence
joseph
after
throwing
out
a
few
vague
assurances
of
goodwill
and
trust
rose
to
take
his
leave
kirkwood
shook
hands
with
him
but
spoke
not
a
word
late
the
same
night
sidney
penned
a
letter
to
michael
snowdon
in
the
morning
he
read
it
over
and
instead
of
putting
it
into
an
envelope
locked
it
away
in
one
of
his
drawers
when
the
evening
for
his
visit
to
hanover
street
again
came
round
he
again
absented
himself
this
time
just
calling
to
leave
word
with
the
servant
that
business
kept
him
away
the
business
was
that
of
walking
aimlessly
about
clerkenwell
in
mud
and
fog
about
ten
he
came
to
farringdon
road
buildings
and
with
a
glance
up
towards
the
window
he
was
passing
by
when
a
hand
clutched
at
him
turning
he
saw
the
face
of
john
hewett
painfully
disturbed
strained
in
some
wild
emotion
come
this
way
i
want
to
speak
to
you
what
wrong
over
here
sidney
i
found
my
girl
i
found
clara
chapter
xxvii
clara
return
eagles
a
woman
of
something
more
than
average
girth
always
took
her
time
in
ascending
to
that
fifth
storey
where
she
and
her
husband
shared
a
tenement
with
the
hewett
family
this
afternoon
her
pause
on
each
landing
was
longer
than
usual
for
a
yellow
fog
which
mocked
the
pale
glimmer
of
on
the
staircase
made
her
gasp
asthmatically
she
carried
too
a
heavy
having
done
her
saturday
purchasing
earlier
than
of
wont
on
account
of
the
intolerable
weather
she
reached
the
door
at
length
and
being
too
much
exhausted
to
search
her
pocket
for
the
latchkey
knocked
for
admission
amy
hewett
opened
to
her
and
she
sank
on
a
chair
in
the
first
room
where
the
other
two
hewett
children
were
bending
over
with
a
studiousness
not
altogether
natural
eagles
had
a
shrewd
eye
having
glanced
at
annie
and
tom
with
a
discreet
smile
she
turned
her
look
towards
the
elder
girl
who
was
standing
full
in
the
lamplight
here
amy
she
said
after
a
moment
scrutiny
you
keep
doin
that
foolish
thing
very
well
then
i
shall
have
to
speak
to
your
father
about
it
i
not
goin
to
see
you
make
yourself
ill
and
do
nothing
to
prevent
you
amy
now
a
girl
of
eleven
affected
much
indignation
i
have
touched
a
drop
mrs
eagles
now
now
now
now
why
your
lips
are
shrivelled
up
like
a
bit
of
o
dried
you
a
silly
girl
that
what
you
are
of
late
amy
hewett
had
become
the
victim
of
a
singular
propensity
whenever
she
could
obtain
vinegar
she
drank
it
as
a
toper
does
spirits
inadequate
nourishment
and
especially
an
unsatisfied
palate
frequently
have
this
result
in
female
children
among
the
poor
it
is
an
anticipation
of
what
will
befall
them
as
soon
as
they
find
their
way
to
the
publichouse
having
administered
a
scolding
eagles
went
into
the
room
which
she
and
her
husband
occupied
it
was
so
encumbered
with
furniture
that
not
more
than
eight
or
ten
square
feet
of
floor
can
have
been
available
for
movement
on
the
bed
sat
eagles
a
spare
ugly
but
very
man
he
and
sidney
kirkwood
had
been
acquaintances
and
for
some
years
but
no
close
intimacy
had
arisen
between
them
owing
to
the
difference
of
their
tastes
and
views
eagles
was
absorbed
in
the
study
of
a
certain
branch
of
political
statistics
the
enthusiasm
of
his
life
was
financial
reform
every
budget
presented
to
parliament
he
criticised
with
extraordinary
thoroughness
and
in
fact
with
an
acumen
which
would
have
made
him
no
inefficient
auxiliary
of
the
chancellor
himself
of
course
he
took
the
view
that
the
nation
resources
were
iniquitously
wasted
and
of
course
had
little
difficulty
in
illustrating
a
truth
so
obvious
what
distinguished
him
from
the
ordinary
malcontent
of
clerkenwell
green
was
his
logical
faculty
and
the
surprising
extent
of
the
information
with
which
he
had
furnished
himself
long
before
there
existed
a
reform
almanack
eagles
practically
represented
that
work
in
his
own
person
disinterested
ardent
with
thoughts
for
but
one
subject
in
the
scope
of
human
inquiry
he
lived
contentedly
on
his
two
pounds
a
week
and
was
for
ever
engaged
in
the
theoretic
manipulation
of
millions
utopian
budgets
multiplied
themselves
in
his
brain
and
his
he
devised
imposts
such
as
minister
never
dreamt
of
yet
which
he
declared
could
not
fail
of
vast
success
just
look
at
these
figures
he
would
exclaim
to
sidney
in
his
low
intense
voice
it
is
in
black
and
white
but
sidney
faculties
were
quite
unequal
to
calculations
of
this
kind
and
eagles
could
never
summon
resolve
to
explain
his
schemes
before
an
audience
indefatigably
he
worked
on
and
the
work
had
to
be
its
own
reward
he
was
busy
in
the
usual
way
this
afternoon
as
he
sat
on
the
bed
coatless
a
trade
journal
open
on
his
knees
his
wife
never
disturbed
him
she
was
a
placid
ruminative
woman
generally
finding
the
details
of
her
own
weekly
budget
quite
a
sufficient
occupation
when
she
had
taken
off
her
bonnet
and
was
turning
out
the
contents
of
her
bag
eagles
remarked
quietly
have
a
bad
journey
a
day
for
her
to
be
travelling
all
that
distance
poor
thing
but
perhaps
it
ai
so
bad
out
o
london
lowering
their
voices
they
began
to
talk
of
john
hewett
and
the
daughter
he
was
bringing
from
lancashire
where
she
had
lain
in
hospital
for
some
weeks
of
the
girl
and
her
past
they
knew
next
to
nothing
but
hewett
restricted
confidences
suggested
disagreeable
things
the
truth
of
the
situation
was
that
john
had
received
by
post
from
he
knew
not
whom
a
newspaper
report
of
the
inquest
held
on
the
body
of
grace
danver
wherein
of
course
was
an
account
of
what
had
happened
to
clara
vale
in
the
margin
was
pencilled
vale
real
name
is
clara
hewett
an
hour
after
receiving
this
john
encountered
sidney
kirkwood
they
read
the
report
together
before
the
coroner
it
had
been
made
public
that
the
dead
woman
was
in
truth
named
rudd
she
who
was
injured
refused
to
give
any
details
concerning
herself
and
her
history
escaped
the
reporters
harbouring
no
doubt
of
the
information
thus
mysteriously
sent
him
the
handwriting
seemed
to
be
that
of
a
man
but
gave
no
further
hint
as
to
its
origin
hewett
the
next
day
journeyed
down
into
lancashire
sidney
supplying
him
with
money
he
found
clara
in
a
perilous
condition
her
face
was
horribly
burnt
with
vitriol
and
the
doctors
could
not
as
yet
answer
for
the
results
of
the
shock
she
had
suffered
one
consolation
alone
offered
itself
in
the
course
of
hewett
inquiries
clara
if
she
recovered
would
not
have
lost
her
eyesight
the
fluid
had
been
thrown
too
low
to
effect
the
worst
injury
the
accident
of
a
trembling
hand
of
a
movement
on
her
part
had
kept
her
eyes
untouched
necessity
brought
the
father
back
to
london
almost
at
once
but
the
news
sent
him
at
brief
intervals
continued
to
be
favourable
now
that
the
girl
could
be
removed
from
the
infirmary
there
was
no
retreat
for
her
but
her
father
home
peel
the
manager
had
made
her
a
present
of
it
was
all
he
could
do
the
members
of
the
company
had
subscribed
another
generously
enough
seeing
that
their
tour
was
come
perforce
to
an
abrupt
close
clara
career
as
an
actress
had
ended
when
the
fog
artificial
night
deepened
at
the
close
of
the
winter
evening
eagles
made
the
hewetts
two
rooms
as
cheerful
as
might
be
expecting
every
moment
the
arrival
of
john
and
his
companion
the
children
were
aware
that
an
all
but
forgotten
sister
was
returning
to
them
and
that
she
had
been
very
ill
they
promised
quietude
amy
set
the
in
order
and
kept
the
kettle
ready
the
knock
for
which
they
were
waiting
eagles
withdrew
into
her
own
room
amy
went
to
the
door
a
tall
figure
so
wrapped
and
veiled
that
nothing
but
the
womanly
outline
could
be
discerned
entered
supported
by
john
hewett
there
a
light
in
the
other
room
amy
john
inquired
in
a
thick
voice
father
he
led
the
muffled
form
into
the
chamber
where
amy
and
annie
slept
the
door
closed
and
for
several
minutes
the
three
children
stood
regarding
each
other
alarmed
mute
then
their
father
joined
them
he
looked
about
in
an
absent
way
slowly
drew
off
his
overcoat
and
when
amy
offered
to
take
it
bent
and
kissed
her
cheek
the
girl
was
startled
to
hear
him
sob
and
to
see
tears
starting
from
his
eyes
turning
suddenly
away
he
stood
before
the
fire
and
made
a
pretence
of
warming
himself
but
his
sobs
overmastered
him
he
leaned
his
arms
on
the
i
pour
out
the
tea
father
amy
ventured
to
ask
when
there
was
again
perfect
silence
you
had
yours
he
replied
her
yet
it
then
all
of
you
yes
you
can
pour
me
out
a
cup
and
put
another
on
the
little
tray
is
this
stuff
in
the
saucepan
ready
eagles
said
it
would
be
in
five
right
get
on
with
your
eatin
all
of
you
he
went
to
eagles
room
and
talked
there
for
a
short
time
presently
eagles
herself
came
out
and
silently
removed
from
the
saucepan
a
mixture
of
broth
and
meat
having
already
taken
the
cup
of
tea
to
clara
hewett
now
returned
to
her
with
this
food
she
was
sitting
by
the
fire
her
face
resting
upon
her
hands
the
lamp
was
extinguished
she
had
said
that
the
firelight
was
enough
john
deposited
his
burden
on
the
table
then
touched
her
shoulder
gently
and
spoke
in
so
soft
a
voice
that
one
would
not
have
recognised
it
as
his
try
an
eat
a
little
my
dear
here
somethin
as
has
been
made
particular
after
travellin
just
a
spoonful
or
two
clara
expressed
reluctance
do
feel
hungry
father
presently
perhaps
well
it
do
want
to
cool
a
bit
do
you
feel
able
to
sit
up
do
take
so
much
trouble
father
i
rather
you
left
me
alone
the
tone
was
not
exactly
impatient
it
spoke
a
weary
indifference
to
everything
and
every
person
i
go
away
dear
but
you
eat
just
a
bit
if
you
do
like
this
you
must
tell
me
and
i
get
something
you
could
fancy
do
well
enough
i
eat
it
presently
i
promise
you
john
hesitated
before
going
shall
you
mind
amy
and
annie
comin
to
sleep
here
if
rather
we
manage
it
somehow
else
what
does
it
matter
they
can
come
when
they
like
only
they
must
want
me
to
talk
to
them
he
went
softly
from
the
room
and
joined
the
children
at
their
tea
his
mood
had
grown
brighter
though
in
talking
he
kept
his
tone
much
softened
there
was
a
smile
upon
his
face
and
he
answered
freely
the
questions
put
to
him
about
his
journey
overcome
at
first
by
the
dark
aspect
of
this
he
now
began
to
taste
the
joy
of
having
clara
under
his
roof
rescued
alike
from
those
vague
dangers
of
the
past
and
from
the
recent
peril
impossible
to
separate
the
sorrow
he
felt
for
her
blighted
life
her
broken
spirit
and
the
solace
lurking
in
the
thought
that
henceforth
she
could
not
abandon
him
never
a
word
to
reproach
her
for
the
unalterable
it
should
be
as
though
there
were
no
gap
between
the
old
love
and
its
renewal
in
the
present
for
clara
used
to
love
him
and
already
she
had
shown
that
his
tenderness
did
not
appeal
to
her
in
vain
during
the
journey
she
had
once
or
twice
pressed
his
hand
in
gratitude
how
well
it
was
that
he
had
this
home
in
which
to
receive
her
half
a
year
ago
and
what
should
he
have
done
he
would
not
admit
to
himself
that
there
were
any
difficulties
ahead
if
it
came
to
that
he
would
manage
to
get
some
extra
work
in
the
evening
and
on
saturday
afternoons
he
would
take
sidney
into
council
but
thereupon
his
face
darkened
again
and
he
lost
himself
in
troubled
musing
midway
in
the
sunday
morning
amy
told
him
that
clara
had
risen
and
would
like
him
to
go
and
sit
with
her
she
would
not
leave
her
room
amy
had
put
it
in
order
and
the
blind
was
drawn
low
clara
sat
by
the
fireside
in
her
attitude
of
last
night
hiding
her
face
as
far
as
she
was
able
the
beauty
of
her
form
would
have
impressed
anyone
who
approached
her
the
grace
of
her
bent
head
but
the
countenance
was
no
longer
that
of
clara
hewett
none
must
now
look
at
her
unless
to
pity
feeling
herself
thus
utterly
changed
she
could
not
speak
in
her
former
natural
voice
her
utterance
was
oppressed
unmusical
monotonous
when
her
father
had
taken
a
place
near
her
she
asked
him
you
got
that
piece
of
newspaper
still
he
had
and
at
her
wish
produced
it
clara
held
it
in
the
light
of
the
fire
and
regarded
the
pencilled
words
closely
then
she
inquired
if
he
wished
to
keep
it
and
on
his
answering
in
the
negative
threw
it
to
be
burnt
hewett
took
her
hand
and
for
a
while
they
kept
silence
you
live
comfortably
here
father
she
said
presently
do
clara
it
a
bit
high
up
but
that
do
matter
much
got
new
furniture
some
new
things
the
old
was
all
done
for
you
know
where
did
you
live
before
you
came
here
we
had
a
place
in
king
cross
road
it
was
much
of
a
place
but
i
suppose
it
might
a
been
worse
that
was
where
yes
it
was
there
how
did
you
manage
to
buy
this
furniture
clara
asked
after
a
pause
my
dear
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
was
a
friend
as
an
old
friend
helped
us
a
bit
would
care
to
say
who
it
was
john
was
gravely
embarrassed
clara
moved
her
head
a
little
so
as
to
regard
him
but
at
once
turned
away
shrinkingly
when
she
met
his
eyes
do
you
like
to
tell
me
father
was
it
mr
kirkwood
my
dear
it
was
neither
spoke
for
a
long
time
clara
head
sank
lower
she
drew
her
hand
away
from
her
father
and
used
it
to
shield
her
face
when
she
spoke
it
was
as
if
to
herself
suppose
he
altered
in
some
ways
much
i
do
see
much
change
myself
but
then
of
course
no
he
pretty
much
the
same
married
is
he
why
what
made
you
think
that
clara
no
not
he
he
had
to
move
not
long
ago
his
lodgin
is
in
red
lion
street
now
does
he
ever
come
here

been
just
now
an
then
you
told
him

felt
i
had
to
no
harm

a
secret
but
he
must
come
whilst

living
and
then
i
shall
go
and
get
a
room

exclaimed
her
father
putting
his
hand
on
her

what

my
girl
but
talk
about
goin
away
from

that
the
one
thing
as
i

bear
i
ai
so
young
as
i
was
and
i
had
things
as

hard
to

mean
when
the

things

that
time
let

about

she
remained
mute
shadows
from
the
firelight
rose
and
fell
upon
the
walls
of
the
room
it
was
a
cloudy
morning
every
now
and
then
a
gust
flung
rain
against
the
window
you
went
he
continued
huskily

be
afraid

i
have
told

as
i
ought

done
to
the
poor
mother
clara

had
hard
things

the
burial
club

up
just
before
she
died
i
could
get
not
a
a
lot
o

you
may
think
how
i
felt
clara
with
her
lyin
there
and
i
had
got
as
much
as

pay
for
a
coffin
it

of
pity
though
the

deeply
moving
for
the
first
time
since
the
exultant
hope
of
her
life
was
blasted
clara

tears
chapter

the
with
the
first
breath
of
winter
there
passes
a
voice
through
all
the
barren
ways
and
refuges
of
the
nether
world
too
quickly
has
vanished
the
brief
season
when
the
sky
is
clement
when
a
little
food
suffices
and
the
chances
of
earning
that
little
are
more
numerous
than
at
other
times
this
wind
that
gives
utterance
to
its
familiar
warning
is
the
of
cold
and
hunger
and
solicitude
that
knows
not

the

be
a
hard

that
occupies
alike
the
patient
workfolk
who
have
yet
their
home
unbroken
the
strugglers
foredoomed
to
loss
of
such
scant
needments
as
the
summer
gifted
them
withal
the
hopeless
and
the
and
the
lurking
creatures
of
prey
to
all
of
them
the
first
chill
breath
from
a
lowering
sky
has
its
voice
of
admonition
they
set
their
faces
they
sigh
or
whisper
a
prayer
or
fling
out
a
curse
each
according
to
his
nature
and
as
though
the
strife
here
were
not
already
hard
enough
behold
from
many
corners
of
the
land
come
needy
emigrants
prospectless
among
their
own
people
fearing
the
dark
season
which
has
so
often
meant
for
them
the
end
of
wages
and
of
food
tempted
hither
by
thought
that
in
the
shadow
of
palaces
work
and
charity
are
both
more
plentiful
vagabonds
too
no
longer
able
to
lie
about
the
country
roads
creep
back
to
their
remembered
lairs
and
join
the
combat
for
crusts
flung
forth
by
casual
hands
day
after
day
the
stress
becomes
more
grim
one
would
think
that
hosts
of
the
weaker
combatants
might
surely
find
it
seasonable
to
let
themselves
be
trodden
out
of
existence
and
so
make
room
for
those
of
more
useful
sinew
somehow
they
cling
to
life
so
few
in
comparison
yield
utterly
the
thoughtful
in
the
world
above
look
about
them
with
contentment
when
are
deep
with
snow
here
is
work
for
the
unemployed
ah
if
the
winter
did
but
last
a
few
months
longer
if
the
wonted
bounds
of
endurance
were
but
by
some
freak
of
nature
sensibly
overpassed
the
would
find
another
kind
of
sweeping
this
winter
was
the
last
that
shooter
gardens
were
destined
to
know
the
leases
had
all
but
run
out
the
middlemen
were
garnering
their
latest
profits
in
the
spring
there
would
come
a
wholesale
demolition
and
would
thereafter
occupy
the
site
meanwhile
the
gardens
looked
their
surliest
the
walls
stood
in
a
perpetual
black
sweat
a
mouldy
reek
came
from
the
open
doorways
the
beings
that
passed
in
and
out
seemed
soaked
with
grimy
moisture
puffed
into
distortions
hung
about
with
rotting
garments
one
such
was
candy
pennyloaf
mother
her
clothing
consisted
of
a
single
gown
and
a
shawl
made
out
of
the
fragments
of
an
old
counterpane
her
clothing
with
exception
of
the
shoes
on
her
feet
those
two
articles
were
literally
all
that
covered
her
bare
body
rage
for
drink
was
with
her
reaching
the
final
mania
useless
to
bestow
anything
upon
her
straightway
it
or
its
value
passed
over
the
counter
of
the
beershop
in
rosoman
street
she
cared
only
for
beer
the
brave
thick
medicated
draught
that
was
so
cheap
and
frenzied
her
so
speedily
her
husband
was
gone
for
good
one
choking
night
of
november
he
beat
her
to
such
purpose
that
she
was
carried
off
to
the
as
dead
the
man
effected
his
escape
and
was
not
likely
to
show
himself
in
the
gardens
again
with
her
still
lived
her
son
stephen
the
potman
his
payment
was
ten
shillings
a
week
with
a
daily
allowance
of
three
pints
and
he
saw
to
it
that
there
was
always
a
loaf
of
bread
in
the
room
they
occupied
together
stephen
took
things
with
much
philosophy
his
mother
would
of
course
drink
herself
to
death
what
was
there
astonishing
in
that
he
himself
had
heart
disease
and
surely
enough
would
drop
down
dead
one
of
these
days
the
one
doom
was
no
more
to
be
quarrelled
with
than
the
other
pennyloaf
came
to
see
them
at
very
long
intervals
what
was
the
use
of
making
her
visits
more
frequent
she
too
viewed
with
a
certain
equanimity
the
progress
of
her
fate
vain
every
kind
of
interposition
worse
than
imprudence
to
give
the
poor
creature
money
or
money
worth
it
could
only
be
hoped
that
the
end
would
come
before
very
long
an
interesting
house
this
in
which
candy
resided
it
contained
in
all
seven
rooms
and
each
room
was
the
home
of
a
family
under
the
roof
slept
persons
men
women
and
children
the
lowest
rent
paid
by
one
of
these
domestic
groups
was
you
would
have
enjoyed
a
peep
into
the
rear
chamber
on
the
ground
floor
there
dwelt
a
family
named
hope
and
hope
sarah
hope
aged
fifteen
dick
hope
aged
twelve
betsy
hope
aged
three
the
father
was
a
cripple
he
and
his
wife
occupied
themselves
in
the
picking
of
rags
of
course
at
home
and
i
can
assure
you
that
the
atmosphere
of
their
abode
was
worthy
of
its
aspect
hope
drank
but
not
desperately
his
forte
was
the
use
of
language
so
peculiarly
violent
that
even
in
shooter
gardens
it
gained
him
a
proud
reputation
on
the
slightest
excuse
he
would
threaten
to
brain
one
of
his
children
to
disembowel
another
to
gouge
out
the
eyes
of
the
third
he
showed
much
ingenuity
in
varying
the
forms
of
menaced
punishment
not
a
child
in
the
gardens
but
was
constantly
threatened
by
its
parents
with
a
violent
death
this
was
so
familiar
that
it
had
lost
its
effect
where
the
nurse
or
mother
in
the
upper
world
cries
shall
scold
you
in
the
nether
the
phrase
is
knock
yer
orff
to
shall
be
very
angry
with
you
in
the
one
sphere
corresponds
in
the
other
murder
you
these
are
conventions
matters
of
no
importance
but
rope
was
a
man
of
individuality
he
could
make
his
family
tremble
he
could
bring
lodgers
about
the
door
to
listen
and
admire
his
resources
in
another
room
abode
a
mother
with
four
children
this
woman
drank
moderately
but
was
very
conscientious
in
despatching
her
three
younger
children
to
school
true
there
was
just
a
little
inconvenience
in
this
punctuality
of
hers
at
all
events
from
the
youngsters
point
of
view
for
only
on
the
first
three
days
of
the
week
had
they
the
slightest
chance
of
a
mouthful
of
breakfast
before
they
departed
mind
i
have
some
dinner
for
you
their
parent
was
wont
to
say
common
enough
in
the
board
schools
this
pursuit
of
knowledge
on
an
empty
stomach
but
then
the
end
is
so
inestimable
yet
another
home
it
was
tenanted
by
two
persons
only
they
appeared
to
be
man
and
wife
but
in
the
legal
sense
were
not
so
nor
did
they
for
a
moment
seek
to
deceive
their
neighbours
with
the
female
you
are
slightly
acquainted
christened
sukey
jollop
she
first
became
jack
bartley
and
now
for
courtesy
sake
was
styled
higgs
sukey
had
strayed
on
to
a
downward
path
conscious
of
it
she
abandoned
herself
to
her
taste
for
strong
drink
and
braved
out
her
degradation
jealousy
of
clem
peckover
was
the
first
cause
of
discord
between
her
and
jack
bartley
a
robust
young
woman
she
finally
sent
jack
about
his
business
by
literal
force
of
arms
and
entered
into
an
alliance
with
ned
higgs
a
notorious
swashbuckler
the
captain
of
a
gang
of
young
ruffians
who
at
this
date
were
giving
much
trouble
to
the
clerkenwell
police
their
speciality
was
the
skilful
use
as
an
offensive
weapon
of
a
stout
leathern
belt
heavily
buckled
higgs
boasted
that
with
one
stroke
of
his
belt
he
could
if
it
seemed
good
to
him
kill
his
man
but
the
fitting
opportunity
for
this
display
of
prowess
had
not
yet
offered
now
it
happened
that
at
the
time
of
her
making
jane
acquaintance
miss
lant
was
particularly
interested
in
gardens
and
the
immediate
vicinity
she
had
associated
herself
with
certain
ladies
who
undertook
the
control
of
a
in
the
neighbourhood
and
as
the
winter
advanced
she
engaged
jane
in
this
work
of
charity
it
was
a
good
means
as
michael
snowdon
agreed
of
enabling
the
girl
to
form
acquaintances
among
the
very
poorest
those
whom
she
hoped
to
serve
effectively
not
with
aid
of
money
alone
but
by
her
personal
influence
and
i
think
it
will
be
worth
while
to
dwell
a
little
on
the
story
of
this
same
it
is
significant
and
shall
take
the
place
of
abstract
comment
on
miss
lant
philanthropic
enterprises
the
kitchen
had
been
doing
successful
work
for
some
years
the
society
which
established
it
entrusted
its
practical
conduct
to
very
practical
people
a
man
and
wife
who
were
themselves
of
the
nether
world
and
knew
the
ways
thereof
the
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
soup
was
wholesome
and
nutritious
the
peas
were
of
excellent
quality
twopence
a
quart
was
the
price
at
which
this
fluid
could
be
purchased
one
penny
if
a
ticket
from
a
member
of
the
committee
were
presented
and
sometimes
as
much
as
five
hundred
quarts
would
be
sold
in
a
day
satisfactory
enough
this
when
the
people
came
with
complaints
saying
that
they
were
tired
of
this
particular
soup
and
would
like
another
kind
for
a
change
and
batterby
with
perfect
understanding
of
the
situation
bade
their
customers
it
or
leave
it
an
none
your
cheek
here
or
you
wo
get
nothing
at
all
the
result
was
much
all
round
but
the
present
year
saw
a
change
in
the
constitution
of
the
committee
two
or
three
philanthropic
ladies
of
great
conscientiousness
began
to
inquire
busily
into
the
working
of
the
and
they
soon
found
reason
to
be
altogether
dissatisfied
with
and
batterby
no
no
these
managers
were
of
too
coarse
a
type
they
spoke
grossly
what
possibility
of
their
exerting
a
humanising
influence
on
the
people
to
whom
they
dispensed
soup
soup
and
refinement
must
be
disseminated
at
one
and
the
same
time
over
the
same
counter
and
batterby
were
dismissed
and
quite
a
new
order
of
things
began
not
only
were
the
ladies
zealous
for
a
high
ideal
in
the
matter
of
they
also
aimed
at
practical
economy
in
the
use
of
funds
having
engaged
a
cook
after
their
own
hearts
and
acting
upon
the
advice
of
competent
physiologists
they
proceeded
to
make
a
out
of
sheep
and
bullocks
heads
moreover
they
ordered
their
peas
from
the
city
thus
getting
them
at
two
shillings
a
sack
less
than
the
price
formerly
paid
by
the
batterbys
to
a
dealer
in
clerkenwell
but
alas
these
things
could
not
be
done
secretly
the
story
leaked
out
shooter
gardens
and
vicinity
broke
into
the
most
excited
feeling
i
need
not
tell
you
that
the
nether
world
will
consume
when
others
supply
it
nothing
but
the
very
finest
quality
of
food
that
the
heads
of
sheep
and
bullocks
are
peculiarly
offensive
to
its
stomach
that
a
saving
effected
on
sacks
of
peas
outrages
its
dearest
sensibilities
what
was
the
result
shooter
gardens
convinced
of
the
fraud
practised
upon
them
nobly
brought
back
their
quarts
of
soup
to
the
kitchen
and
with
proud
independence
of
language
demanded
to
have
their
money
returned
on
being
met
with
a
refusal
they
what
think
you
emptied
the
soup
on
to
the
floor
and
went
away
with
heads
exalted
vast
was
the
indignation
of
miss
lant
and
the
other
ladies
is
their
gratitude
now
if
you
or
i
had
been
there
what
an
opportunity
for
easing
our
minds
mesdames
you
have
entered
upon
this
work
with
expectation
of
gratitude
and
can
you
not
perceive
that
these
people
of
shooter
gardens
are
poor
besotted
creatures
of
whom
in
the
mass
scarcely
a
human
quality
is
to
be
expected
have
you
still
to
learn
what
this
nether
world
has
been
made
by
those
who
belong
to
the
sphere
above
it
gratitude
quotha
nay
do
be
grateful
that
these
hapless
women
do
not
turn
and
rend
you
at
present
they
satisfy
themselves
with
insolence
take
it
silently
you
who
at
all
events
hold
some
count
of
their
dire
state
and
endeavour
to
feed
them
without
arousing
their
animosity
well
the
kitchen
threatened
to
be
a
failure
it
turned
out
that
the
cheaper
peas
were
in
fact
of
inferior
quality
and
the
ladies
hastened
to
go
back
to
the
dealer
in
clerkenwell
this
was
something
but
now
came
a
new
trouble
the
complaint
with
which
and
batterby
had
known
so
well
how
to
deal
revived
in
view
of
the
concessions
made
by
the
new
managers
shooter
gardens
would
have
no
more
peas
let
some
other
vegetable
be
used
again
the
point
was
conceded
a
trial
was
made
of
barley
soup
shooter
gardens
came
looked
smelt
and
shook
their
heads
do
look
nice
was
their
comment
they
would
none
of
it
for
two
or
three
weeks
just
at
this
crisis
in
the
kitchen
fate
jane
snowdon
attended
with
miss
lant
to
help
in
the
dispensing
of
the
decoction
jane
was
made
very
nervous
by
the
disturbances
that
went
on
but
she
was
able
to
review
the
matter
at
issue
in
a
far
more
fruitful
way
than
miss
lant
and
the
other
ladies
her
opinion
was
not
asked
however
in
the
homely
grey
dress
with
her
modest
retiring
manner
her
gentle
diffident
countenance
she
was
taken
by
the
customers
for
a
paid
servant
and
if
ever
it
happened
that
she
could
not
supply
a
can
of
soup
quickly
enough
sharp
words
reached
her
ear
then
you
gyurl
there
are
you
goin
to
keep
me
all
i
got
somethink
else
to
do
but
stand
and
jane
by
her
timid
hastening
confirmed
the
original
impression
with
the
result
that
she
was
treated
yet
more
unceremoniously
next
time
of
all
forms
of
insolence
there
is
none
more
flagrant
than
that
of
the
degraded
poor
receiving
charity
which
they
have
come
to
regard
as
a
right
jane
did
speak
at
length
miss
lant
had
called
to
see
her
in
hanover
street
seated
quietly
in
her
own
parlour
with
michael
snowdon
to
approve
with
him
she
had
already
discussed
the
matter
jane
ventured
softly
to
compare
the
present
state
of
things
and
that
of
former
winters
as
described
to
her
by
various
people
it
rather
a
pity
she
suggested
the
old
people
were
sent
away
think
so
returned
miss
lant
with
the
air
of
one
to
whom
a
novel
thought
is
presented
really
think
so
miss
snowdon
got
on
so
well
with
everybody
jane
continued
do
you
think
it
better
miss
lant
for
everybody
to
feel
satisfied
really
batterby
used
to
speak
so
very
harshly
he
destroyed
their
do
think
they
minded
it
said
jane
with
simple
good
faith
i
always
hearing
them
wish
he
was
back
instead
of
the
new
managers
think
we
shall
have
to
consider
this
remarked
the
lady
thoughtfully
considered
it
was
and
with
the
result
that
the
batterbys
before
long
found
themselves
in
their
old
position
uproariously
welcomed
by
shooter
gardens
in
a
few
weeks
the
soup
was
once
more
concocted
of
familiar
ingredients
and
customers
as
often
as
they
grumbled
had
the
pleasure
of
being
rebuked
in
their
native
tongue
it
was
with
anything
but
a
cheerful
heart
that
jane
went
through
this
initiation
into
the
philanthropic
life
her
brief
period
of
joy
and
confidence
was
followed
by
a
return
of
anxiety
which
no
resolve
could
suppress
it
was
not
only
that
the
ideals
to
which
she
strove
to
form
herself
made
no
genuine
appeal
to
her
nature
the
imperative
hunger
of
her
heart
remained
unsatisfied
at
first
when
the
assurance
received
from
michael
began
to
lose
a
little
of
its
sustaining
force
she
could
say
to
herself
patience
be
faithful
be
trustful
and
your
reward
will
soon
come
nor
would
patience
have
failed
her
had
but
the
current
of
life
flowed
on
in
the
old
way
it
was
the
introduction
of
new
and
disturbing
things
that
proved
so
great
a
test
of
fortitude
those
two
successive
absences
of
sidney
on
the
appointed
evening
were
strangely
unlike
him
but
perhaps
could
be
explained
by
the
unsettlement
of
his
removal
his
manner
when
at
length
he
did
come
proved
that
the
change
in
himself
was
still
proceeding
moreover
the
change
affected
michael
who
manifested
increase
of
mental
trouble
at
the
same
time
that
he
yielded
more
and
more
to
physical
infirmity
the
letter
which
sidney
wrote
after
receiving
joseph
confidential
communications
was
despatched
two
days
later
he
expressed
himself
in
carefully
chosen
words
but
the
purport
of
the
letter
was
to
make
known
that
he
no
longer
thought
of
jane
save
as
a
friend
that
the
change
in
her
position
had
compelled
him
to
take
another
view
of
his
relations
to
her
than
that
he
had
confided
to
michael
at
danbury
most
fortunately
he
added
no
utterance
of
his
feelings
had
ever
escaped
him
to
jane
herself
and
henceforth
he
should
be
still
more
careful
to
avoid
any
suggestion
of
more
than
brotherly
interest
in
very
deed
nothing
was
altered
he
was
still
her
steadfast
friend
and
would
always
aid
her
to
his
utmost
in
the
work
of
her
life
that
sidney
could
send
this
letter
after
keeping
it
in
reserve
for
a
couple
of
days
proved
how
profoundly
his
instincts
were
revolted
by
the
difficulties
and
the
ambiguity
of
his
position
it
had
been
bad
enough
when
only
his
own
conscience
was
in
play
the
dialogue
with
joseph
following
upon
bessie
byass
indiscretion
threw
him
wholly
off
his
balance
and
he
could
give
no
weight
to
any
consideration
but
the
necessity
of
recovering
even
the
sophistry
of
that
repeated
statement
that
he
had
never
approached
jane
as
a
lover
did
not
trouble
him
in
face
of
the
injury
to
his
pride
every
word
of
joseph
snowdon
transparently
artful
hints
was
a
sting
to
his
sensitiveness
the
sum
excited
him
to
loathing
it
was
as
though
the
corner
of
a
curtain
had
been
raised
giving
him
a
glimpse
of
all
the
vile
greed
the
base
machination
hovering
about
this
fortune
that
jane
was
to
inherit
of
scawthorne
he
knew
nothing
but
his
recollection
of
the
peckovers
was
vivid
enough
to
suggest
what
part
joseph
snowdon
was
playing
in
the
present
intrigues
and
he
felt
convinced
that
in
the
background
were
other
beasts
of
prey
watching
with
keen
envious
eyes
the
sudden
revelation
was
a
shock
from
which
he
would
not
soon
recover
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
in
a
degree
contaminated
he
questioned
his
most
secret
thoughts
again
and
again
recognizing
with
torment
the
fears
which
had
already
bidden
him
draw
back
he
desired
to
purify
himself
by
some
unmistakable
action
that
which
happened
he
had
anticipated
on
receipt
of
the
letter
michael
came
to
see
him
he
found
the
old
man
waiting
in
front
of
the
house
when
he
returned
to
red
lion
street
after
his
work
the
conversation
that
followed
was
a
severe
test
of
sidney
resolve
had
michael
disclosed
the
fact
of
his
private
understanding
with
jane
sidney
would
probably
have
yielded
but
the
old
man
gave
no
hint
of
what
he
had
done
partly
because
he
found
it
difficult
to
make
the
admission
partly
in
consequence
of
an
indecision
in
his
own
mind
with
regard
to
the
very
point
at
issue
though
agitated
by
the
consciousness
of
suffering
in
store
for
jane
his
thoughts
disturbed
by
the
derangement
of
a
part
of
his
plan
he
did
not
feel
that
sidney
change
of
mind
gravely
affected
the
plan
itself
age
had
cooled
his
blood
enthusiasm
had
made
personal
interests
of
comparatively
small
account
to
him
he
recognised
his
granddaughter
feeling
but
could
not
appreciate
its
intensity
its
surpreme
significance
when
kirkwood
made
a
show
of
explaining
himself
saying
that
he
shrank
from
that
form
of
responsibility
that
such
a
marriage
suggested
to
him
many
and
insuperable
embarrassments
michael
began
to
reflect
that
perchance
this
was
the
just
view
with
household
and
family
cares
could
jane
devote
herself
to
the
great
work
after
the
manner
of
his
ideal
had
he
not
been
tempted
by
his
friendship
for
sidney
to
introduce
into
his
scheme
what
was
really
an
incompatible
element
was
it
not
decidedly
infinitely
better
that
jane
should
be
unmarried
michael
had
taken
the
last
step
in
that
process
of
dehumanisation
which
threatens
idealists
of
his
type
he
had
reached
at
length
the
pass
of
those
frenzied
votaries
of
a
supernatural
creed
who
exact
from
their
disciples
the
sacrifice
of
every
human
piety
returning
home
he
murmured
to
himself
again
and
again
must
not
marry
she
must
overcome
this
desire
of
a
happiness
such
as
ordinary
women
may
enjoy
for
my
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
her
suffering
jane
must
win
this
victory
over
herself
he
purposed
speaking
to
her
but
put
it
off
from
day
to
day
sidney
paid
his
visits
as
usual
and
tried
desperately
to
behave
as
though
he
had
no
trouble
could
he
have
divined
why
it
was
that
michael
had
ended
by
accepting
his
vague
pretences
with
apparent
calm
indignation
wrath
would
have
possessed
him
he
believed
however
that
the
old
man
out
of
kindness
subdued
what
he
really
felt
sidney
state
was
pitiable
he
knew
not
whether
he
more
shrank
from
the
thought
of
being
infected
with
joseph
snowdon
baseness
or
despised
himself
for
his
attitude
to
jane
despicable
entirely
had
been
his
explanations
to
michael
but
how
could
he
make
them
more
sincere
to
tell
the
whole
truth
to
reveal
joseph
tactics
would
be
equivalent
to
taking
a
part
in
the
dirty
contest
michael
would
probably
do
him
justice
but
who
could
say
how
far
joseph
machinations
were
becoming
effectual
the
slightest
tinct
of
uncertainty
in
the
old
man
thought
and
he
kirkwood
became
a
plotter
like
the
others
meeting
mine
with
countermine
will
be
no
possibility
of
perfect
faith
between
men
until
there
is
no
such
thing
as
money
h
and
when
is
that
likely
to
come
to
pass
thus
he
epigrammatised
to
himself
one
evening
savagely
enough
as
with
head
bent
forward
he
plodded
to
red
lion
street
some
one
addressed
him
he
looked
up
and
saw
jane
seemingly
it
was
a
chance
meeting
but
she
put
a
question
at
once
almost
as
though
she
had
been
waiting
for
him
you
seen
pennyloaf
lately
mr
kirkwood
pennyloaf
the
name
suggested
bob
hewett
who
again
suggested
john
hewett
and
so
sidney
fell
upon
thoughts
of
some
one
who
two
days
ago
had
found
a
refuge
in
john
home
to
michael
he
had
said
nothing
of
what
he
knew
concerning
clara
a
fresh
occasion
of
uneasy
thought
bob
hewett
so
john
said
had
no
knowledge
of
his
sister
situation
otherwise
pennyloaf
might
have
come
to
know
about
it
and
in
that
case
perchance
jane
herself
why
not
into
what
a
wretched
muddle
of
concealments
and
inconsistencies
and
insincerities
had
he
fallen
far
too
long
since
i
saw
her
he
replied
in
that
softened
tone
which
he
found
it
impossible
to
avoid
when
his
eyes
met
jane
she
was
on
her
way
home
from
the
where
certain
occupations
had
kept
her
much
later
than
usual
this
however
was
far
out
of
her
way
and
sidney
remarked
on
the
fact
perversely
when
she
had
offered
this
explanation
of
her
meeting
him
jane
did
not
reply
they
walked
on
together
towards
islington
you
going
to
help
at
that
place
all
the
winter
he
inquired
i
think
so
if
he
had
spoken
his
thought
he
would
have
railed
against
the
and
all
that
was
connected
with
it
so
far
had
he
got
in
his
revolt
against
circumstances
jane
was
hateful
to
him
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
her
handing
soup
over
a
counter
to
ragged
wretches
nothing
like
as
cheerful
as
you
used
to
be
he
said
suddenly
and
all
but
roughly
is
it
what
a
question
jane
reddened
as
she
tried
to
look
at
him
with
a
smile
no
words
would
come
to
her
tongue
you
go
anywhere
else
besides
to
to
that
place
not
often
she
had
accompanied
miss
lant
on
a
visit
to
some
people
in
shooter
gardens
sidney
bent
his
brows
a
nice
spot
shooter
gardens
houses
are
going
to
be
pulled
down
i
glad
to
say
continued
jane
lant
thinks
it
be
a
good
opportunity
for
helping
a
few
of
the
families
into
better
lodgings
we
going
to
buy
furniture
for
them
so
many
have
as
good
as
none
at
all
you
know
it
be
a
good
start
for
them
wo
it
sidney
nodded
he
was
thinking
of
another
family
who
already
owed
their
furniture
to
jane
beneficence
though
they
did
not
know
it
you
do
throw
away
kindness
on
worthless
people
he
said
presently
can
only
do
our
best
and
hope
they
keep
comfortable
for
their
own
sakes
yes
well
i
say
to
you
here
go
home
and
rest
you
look
tired
he
no
longer
called
her
by
her
name
tearing
himself
away
with
a
last
look
he
raged
inwardly
that
so
sweet
and
gentle
a
creature
should
be
condemned
to
such
a
waste
of
her
young
life
jane
had
obtained
what
she
came
for
at
times
the
longing
to
see
him
grew
insupportable
and
this
evening
she
had
yielded
to
it
going
out
of
her
way
in
the
hope
of
encountering
him
as
he
came
from
work
he
spoke
very
strangely
what
did
it
all
mean
and
when
would
this
winter
of
suspense
give
sign
of
vanishing
before
sunlight
chapter
xxix
phantoms
and
joseph
snowdon
were
now
established
in
rooms
in
burton
crescent
which
is
not
far
from
king
cross
joseph
had
urged
that
clerkenwell
close
was
scarcely
a
suitable
quarter
for
a
man
of
his
standing
and
though
with
difficulty
he
had
achieved
thus
much
deliverance
of
clem
he
could
not
get
rid
just
yet
but
it
was
something
to
escape
peckover
superintendence
clem
herself
favoured
the
removal
naturally
for
private
reasons
thus
far
working
in
alliance
with
her
shrewd
mother
she
was
now
forming
independent
projects
peckover
zeal
was
assuredly
not
disinterested
and
why
clem
mused
with
herself
should
the
fruits
of
strategy
be
shared
her
husband
father
could
not
she
saw
every
reason
to
believe
be
much
longer
for
this
world
how
his
property
was
to
be
divided
she
had
no
means
of
discovering
joseph
professed
to
have
no
accurate
information
but
as
a
matter
of
course
he
was
deceiving
her
should
he
inherit
a
considerable
sum
it
was
more
than
probable
he
would
think
of
again
quitting
his
native
land
and
without
encumbrances
that
movement
must
somehow
be
guarded
against
how
it
was
difficult
as
yet
to
determine
in
the
next
place
jane
was
sure
to
take
a
large
share
of
the
fortune
to
that
clem
strongly
objected
both
on
abstract
grounds
and
because
she
regarded
jane
with
a
savage
hatred
a
hatred
which
had
its
roots
in
the
time
of
jane
childhood
and
which
had
grown
in
proportion
as
the
girl
reaped
happiness
from
life
the
necessity
of
cloaking
this
sentiment
had
not
you
may
be
sure
tended
to
mitigate
it
joseph
said
that
there
was
no
longer
any
fear
of
a
speedy
marriage
between
jane
and
kirkwood
but
that
such
a
marriage
would
come
off
some
day
if
not
prevented
clem
held
to
be
a
matter
of
certainty
sidney
kirkwood
was
a
young
man
of
course
he
had
his
satisfactory
reasons
for
delay
now
clem
hatred
of
sidney
was
from
of
old
only
less
than
that
wherewith
she
regarded
jane
to
frustrate
the
hopes
of
that
couple
would
be
a
gratification
worth
a
good
deal
of
risk
she
heard
nothing
of
what
had
befallen
clara
hewett
until
the
return
home
and
then
not
from
her
husband
joseph
and
scawthorne
foiled
by
that
event
in
an
ingenious
scheme
which
you
have
doubtless
understood
they
little
knowing
how
easily
the
severance
between
jane
and
kirkwood
might
be
effected
agreed
that
it
was
well
to
get
clara
restored
to
her
father
household
for
though
it
seemed
unlikely
it
was
not
impossible
that
she
might
in
one
way
or
another
aid
their
schemes
and
on
that
account
the
anonymous
letter
was
despatched
which
informed
john
hewett
of
his
daughter
position
between
john
and
snowdon
now
that
they
stood
in
the
relations
of
master
and
servant
there
was
naturally
no
longer
familiar
intercourse
and
in
begging
leave
of
absence
for
his
journey
northwards
hewett
only
said
that
a
near
relative
had
met
with
a
bad
accident
but
it
would
be
easy
joseph
decided
to
win
the
man
confidence
again
and
thus
be
apprised
of
all
that
went
on
with
clem
he
kept
silence
on
the
subject
not
improbably
she
would
learn
sooner
or
later
what
had
happened
and
indeed
as
things
now
stood
it
did
not
matter
much
but
on
principle
he
excluded
her
as
much
as
possible
from
his
confidence
he
knew
she
hated
him
and
he
was
not
backward
in
returning
the
sentiment
though
constantly
affecting
a
cheerful
friendliness
in
his
manner
to
her
after
all
their
union
was
but
temporary
in
hanover
street
he
was
also
silent
regarding
the
hewetts
for
there
his
role
was
that
of
a
good
fellow
incapable
of
intrigue
living
for
the
domestic
affections
if
kirkwood
chose
to
speak
to
michael
or
jane
of
the
matter
well
one
way
or
another
that
would
advance
things
a
stage
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
watch
the
progress
alone
all
through
the
day
and
very
often
in
the
evening
clem
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
occupy
herself
in
domestic
activity
the
lodgings
were
taken
furnished
and
a
bondmaid
of
the
house
did
such
work
as
was
indispensable
dirt
and
disorder
were
matters
of
indifference
to
the
pair
who
represented
therein
the
large
class
occupying
cheap
london
lodgings
an
impure
atmosphere
surroundings
more
or
less
squalid
constant
bickering
with
the
landlady
coarse
usage
of
the
servant
these
things
clem
understood
as
necessaries
of
independent
life
and
it
would
have
cost
her
much
discomfort
had
she
been
required
to
live
in
a
more
civilised
manner
her
ambitions
were
essentially
gross
in
the
way
of
social
advancement
she
appreciated
nothing
but
an
increased
power
of
spending
money
and
consequently
of
asserting
herself
over
others
she
had
no
desire
whatever
to
enter
a
higher
class
than
that
in
which
she
was
born
to
be
of
importance
in
her
familiar
circle
was
the
most
she
aimed
at
in
visiting
the
theatre
she
did
not
so
much
care
to
occupy
a
superior
place
indeed
such
a
position
made
her
ill
at
ease
as
to
astonish
her
neighbours
in
the
pit
by
a
lavish
style
of
costume
by
loud
remarks
implying
a
free
command
of
cash
by
purchase
between
the
acts
of
something
expensive
to
eat
or
drink
needless
to
say
that
she
never
read
anything
but
police
news
in
the
fiction
of
her
world
she
found
no
charm
so
sluggishly
unimaginative
was
her
nature
till
of
late
she
had
either
abandoned
herself
all
day
long
to
a
brutal
indolence
eating
rather
too
much
and
finding
quite
sufficient
occupation
for
her
slow
brain
in
the
thought
of
how
pleasant
it
was
not
to
be
obliged
to
work
and
occasionally
in
reviewing
the
chances
that
she
might
eventually
have
plenty
of
money
and
no
joseph
snowdon
as
a
restraint
upon
her
or
else
her
physical
robustness
demanding
exercise
she
walked
considerable
distances
about
the
localities
she
knew
calling
now
and
then
upon
an
acquaintance
till
of
late
but
a
change
had
come
upon
her
life
it
was
now
seldom
that
she
kept
the
house
all
day
when
within
doors
she
was
restless
quarrelsome
joseph
became
aware
with
surprise
that
she
no
longer
tried
to
conceal
her
enmity
against
him
on
a
slight
provocation
she
broke
into
a
fierceness
which
reminded
him
of
the
day
when
he
undeceived
her
as
to
his
position
and
her
look
at
such
times
was
murderous
it
might
come
he
imagined
of
her
being
released
from
the
prudent
control
of
her
mother
however
again
a
few
weeks
and
things
were
somewhat
improved
she
eyed
him
like
a
wild
beast
but
was
less
frequent
in
her
outbreaks
here
too
it
might
be
that
peckover
influence
was
at
work
for
clara
spent
at
least
four
evenings
of
the
seven
away
from
home
and
always
said
she
had
been
at
the
close
as
indifferent
as
it
was
possible
to
be
joseph
made
no
attempt
to
restrain
her
independence
indeed
he
was
glad
to
have
her
out
of
his
way
we
must
follow
her
on
one
of
these
evenings
ostensibly
passed
at
peckover
no
not
follow
but
discover
her
at
nine
in
old
street
not
far
from
shoreditch
station
was
a
shabby
little
place
of
refreshment
kept
by
an
italian
pastry
and
filled
the
window
at
the
back
of
the
shop
through
a
doorway
on
each
side
of
which
was
looped
a
pink
curtain
a
room
furnished
with
three
tables
invited
those
who
wished
to
eat
and
drink
more
at
ease
than
was
possible
before
the
counter
except
on
sunday
evening
this
room
was
very
little
used
and
there
on
the
occasion
of
which
i
speak
clem
was
sitting
with
bob
hewett
they
had
been
having
supper
together
french
pastry
and
a
cup
of
cocoa
she
leaned
forward
on
her
elbows
and
said
imperatively
pennyloaf
to
make
it
up
with
her
again
i
want
to
know
what
goes
on
in
hanover
street
you
was
a
fool
to
send
her
away
and
you
ought
to
have
told
me
about
it
before
now
if
they
was
such
friends
i
suppose
the
girl
told
her
lots
o
things
but
i
expect
they
see
each
other
just
the
same
you
do
suppose
she
does
all
tell
her
bet
you
what
you
like
she
does
cried
bob
clem
glared
at
him
you
an
your
pennyloaf
likely
she
tells
you
the
truth
you
so
fond
of
each
other
ai
you
tells
you
everything
does
she
and
the
way
you
treat
her
always
at
me
to
make
me
treat
her
worse
still
bob
retorted
half
angrily
half
in
expostulation
and
so
i
am
i
hate
the
name
of
her
i
like
to
hear
as
you
starve
her
and
her
brats
half
to
death
how
much
money
did
you
give
her
last
week
now
you
just
tell
me
the
truth
how
much
was
it
can
i
remember
three
or
four
bob
i
or
four
bob
she
repeated
snarling
her
one
and
make
her
live
all
the
week
on
it
wear
her
down
make
her
pawn
all
she
has
and
go
cold
her
cheeks
were
on
fire
her
eyes
started
in
the
fury
of
jealousy
she
set
her
teeth
together
better
do
for
her
altogether
said
bob
with
an
evil
grin
clem
looked
at
him
without
speaking
kept
her
gaze
on
him
then
she
said
in
a
thick
voice
many
a
true
word
said
in
joke
bob
moved
uncomfortably
there
was
a
brief
silence
then
the
other
putting
her
face
nearer
his
just
yet
i
want
to
use
her
to
get
all
i
can
about
that
girl
and
her
old
beast
of
a
grandfather
mind
you
do
as
i
tell
you
to
have
her
back
again
and
she
to
make
her
talk
and
you
to
get
all
you
can
from
pennyloaf
understand
there
came
noises
from
the
shop
three
had
just
entered
and
were
buying
cakes
which
they
began
to
eat
at
the
counter
they
were
loud
in
gossip
and
laughter
and
their
voices
rang
like
brass
against
brass
clem
amused
herself
in
listening
to
them
for
a
few
minutes
then
she
became
absent
moving
a
finger
round
and
round
on
her
plate
a
disagreeable
flush
still
lingered
under
her
eyes
you
told
her
about
clara
who
pennyloaf
of
course
i
have
why
should
i
you
such
a
affectionate
couple
see
you
only
to
give
her

hungry
this
nice
weather
wo

that
if
jane
snowdon

so
there
you
out
of
it
clem
bit
her
lip
the
odds

it
up
with
a
hit
in
the
mouth
now
and
then
do

an

mused
eating
her
lower
lip
supposin
jo

to
go
off
first
after
the
old
bloke
should
i
have
all
he
left

and
then

if

accident
you
know
suppose
you
would
but
then
that
only
if
they
did
make
wills
and
leave
it
away
from
you
clem
started
intent
as
she
had
been
for
a
long
time
on
the
possibilities
hinted
at
the
thought
of
unfavourable
disposition
by
will
had
never
occurred
to
her
she
shook
it
away
should
they
make
wills
they
ai
old
enough
for
that
neither
of
them
you
might
as
well
say
they
ai
old
enough
to
be
likely
to
take
their
hook
either
suggested
bob
with
a
certain
uneasiness
in
his
tone
clem
looked
about
her
as
if
her
fierce
eyes
sought
something
her
brows
twitched
a
little
she
glanced
at
bob
but
he
did
not
meet
her
look
do
care
so
much
about
the
money
she
said
in
a
lower
and
altered
voice
be
content
with
a
bit
of
it
if
only
i
could
get
rid
of
him
at
the
same
time
bob
looked
gloomy
it
no
use
talking
he
muttered
all
your
fault
do
you
make
that
out
it
was
you
quarrelled
first
a
liar
there
no
talking
to
you
he
shuffled
with
his
feet
then
rose
can
i
see
you
on
wednesday
morning
asked
clem
want
to
hear
about
that
girl
ca
be
wednesday
morning
i
tell
you
i
shall
be
getting
the
sack
next
thing
they
promised
it
two
days
last
week
i
was
at
the
shop
and
one
day
this
it
ca
go
on
his
companion
retorted
angrily
and
for
five
minutes
they
stood
in
embittered
colloquy
it
ended
in
bob
turning
away
and
going
out
into
the
street
clem
followed
and
they
walked
westwards
in
silence
reaching
city
road
and
crossing
to
the
corner
where
lowers
hospital
grim
abode
of
the
insane
here
in
the
midst
of
squalor
and
uproar
they
halted
to
take
leave
the
last
words
they
exchanged
after
making
an
appointment
were
of
brutal
violence
this
was
two
days
after
clara
hewett
arrival
in
london
and
the
same
fog
still
hung
about
the
streets
allowing
little
to
be
seen
save
the
blurred
glimmer
of
gas
bob
sauntered
through
it
his
hands
in
his
pockets
observant
of
nothing
now
and
then
a
word
escaped
his
lips
generally
an
oath
out
of
old
street
he
turned
into
whitecross
street
whence
by
black
and
all
but
deserted
ways
barbican
and
long
lane
he
emerged
into
west
smithfield
an
alley
in
the
shadow
of
hospital
brought
him
to
a
certain
house
just
as
he
was
about
to
knock
at
the
door
it
opened
and
jack
bartley
appeared
on
the
threshold
they
exchanged
a
of
surprise
and
after
a
whispered
word
or
two
on
the
pavement
went
in
they
mounted
the
stairs
to
a
bedroom
which
jack
occupied
when
the
door
was
closed
got
copped
bartley
any
of
it
on
him
the
as
he
was
pitchin
thank
god
they
let
him
go
again
after
he
been
to
the
station
it
was
a
conductor
i
never
try
them
blokes
myself
they
too
downy
have
a
look
at
said
bob
after
musing
thought
myself
as
they
was
quite
the
as
he
spoke
he
softly
turned
the
key
in
the
door
jack
then
put
his
arm
up
the
chimney
and
brought
down
a
small
tin
box
he
opened
it
and
showed
about
a
dozen
pieces
of
money
in
appearance
and
florins
one
of
the
commonest
of
offences
against
the
law
in
london
this
to
which
our
young
friends
were
not
unsuccessfully
directing
their
attention
one
of
the
easiest
to
commit
moreover
for
a
man
with
bob
craft
at
his
a
mere
question
of
a
mould
and
a
if
one
be
content
with
the
simpler
branches
of
the
industry
snyde
or
queer
is
the
technical
name
by
which
such
products
are
known
distribution
is
of
course
the
main
difficulty
it
necessitates
mutual
trust
between
various
confederates
bob
hewett
still
kept
to
his
daily
work
but
gradually
he
was
being
drawn
into
alliance
with
an
increasing
number
of
men
who
scorned
the
yoke
of
a
recognised
occupation
his
face
his
clothing
his
speech
all
told
whither
he
was
tending
had
one
but
the
experience
necessary
for
the
noting
of
such
points
bob
did
not
find
his
life
particularly
pleasant
he
was
in
perpetual
fear
many
a
time
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
turn
back
impossible
to
do
so
for
a
thousand
reasons
impossible
yet
he
still
believed
that
the
choice
lay
with
him
his
colloquy
with
jack
only
lasted
a
few
minutes
then
he
walked
homewards
crossing
the
metropolitan
going
up
lane
beneath
john
arch
thence
to
rosoman
street
and
merlin
place
where
at
present
he
lived
all
the
way
he
pondered
clem
words
already
their
import
had
become
familiar
enough
to
lose
that
first
terribleness
of
course
he
should
never
take
up
the
proposal
seriously
no
no
that
was
going
a
bit
too
far
but
suppose
clem
husband
were
really
contriving
this
plot
on
his
own
account
likely
very
likely
but
he
be
a
clever
fellow
if
he
managed
such
a
thing
in
a
way
that
did
not
immediately
subject
him
to
suspicion
how
could
it
be
done
no
harm
in
thinking
over
an
affair
of
that
kind
when
you
have
no
intention
of
being
drawn
into
it
yourself
there
was
that
man
at
peckham
who
poisoned
his
sister
not
long
ago
he
was
a
fool
to
get
found
out
in
the
way
he
did
he
might
have
the
room
in
which
he
found
pennyloaf
sitting
was
so
full
of
fog
that
the
lamp
seemed
very
dim
the
fire
had
all
but
died
out
one
of
the
children
lay
asleep
the
other
pennyloaf
was
nursing
for
it
had
a
bad
cough
and
looked
much
like
a
wax
doll
that
has
gone
through
a
great
deal
of
a
few
more
weeks
and
pennyloaf
would
be
again
a
mother
she
felt
very
miserable
as
often
as
she
thought
of
it
and
bob
had
several
times
spoken
with
harsh
impatience
on
the
subject
at
present
he
was
in
no
mood
for
conversation
to
pennyloaf
remarks
and
questions
he
gave
not
the
slightest
heed
but
in
a
few
minutes
tumbled
himself
into
bed
that
light
put
out
he
exclaimed
after
lying
still
for
a
while
pennyloaf
said
she
was
uneasy
about
the
child
its
cough
seemed
to
be
better
but
it
moved
about
restlessly
and
showed
no
sign
of
getting
to
sleep
it
some
of
the
mixture
then
be
sharp
and
put
the
light
out
pennyloaf
obeyed
the
second
injunction
and
she
too
lay
down
keeping
the
child
in
her
arms
of
the
she
was
afraid
for
a
few
days
since
the
child
of
a
neighbour
had
died
in
consequence
of
an
overdose
of
this
same
anodyne
for
a
long
time
there
was
silence
in
the
room
outside
voices
kept
sounding
with
that
peculiar
muffled
distinctness
which
they
have
on
a
night
of
dense
fog
when
there
is
little
or
no
to
make
the
wonted
rumbling
bob
asked
suddenly
something
i
wanted
to
tell
you
you
can
have
jane
snowdon
here
again
if
you
like
can
really
may
as
well
make
use
of
her
that
do
shut
up
and
go
to
sleep
in
the
morning
pennyloaf
was
obliged
to
ask
for
money
she
wished
to
take
the
child
to
the
hospital
again
and
as
the
weather
was
very
bad
she
would
have
to
pay
an
omnibus
fare
bob
growled
at
the
demand
as
was
nowadays
his
custom
since
he
had
found
a
way
of
keeping
his
own
pocket
tolerably
well
supplied
from
time
to
time
he
was
becoming
so
penurious
at
home
that
pennyloaf
had
to
beg
for
what
she
needed
copper
by
copper
excepting
breakfast
he
seldom
took
a
meal
with
her
the
easy
which
in
the
beginning
made
him
an
indulgent
husband
had
turned
in
other
directions
since
his
marriage
was
grown
a
weariness
to
him
he
did
not
in
truth
spend
much
upon
himself
but
in
his
leisure
time
was
always
surrounded
by
companions
whom
he
had
a
pleasure
in
treating
with
the
generosity
of
the
a
word
of
flattery
was
always
sure
of
payment
if
bob
had
a
coin
in
his
pocket
ever
hungry
for
admiration
for
prominence
he
found
new
opportunities
of
gratifying
his
taste
now
that
he
had
a
resource
when
his
wages
ran
out
so
far
from
becoming
again
with
his
wife
and
children
he
grudged
every
coin
that
he
was
obliged
to
expend
on
them
submissiveness
encouraged
him
in
this
habit
where
other
wives
would
have
a
row
she
yielded
at
once
to
his
grumbling
and
made
shift
with
the
paltriest
allowance
you
should
have
seen
the
kind
of
diet
on
which
she
habitually
lived
like
all
the
women
of
her
class
utterly
ignorant
and
helpless
in
the
matter
of
preparing
food
she
abandoned
the
attempt
to
cook
anything
and
expended
her
few
pence
daily
on
whatever
happened
to
tempt
her
in
a
shop
when
came
round
in
the
present
state
of
her
health
she
often
suffered
from
a
morbid
appetite
and
fed
on
things
of
incredible
unwholesomeness
thus
there
was
a
kind
of
cake
exposed
in
a
window
in
rosoman
street
two
layers
of
pastry
with
half
an
inch
of
something
like
very
coarse
mincemeat
between
it
cost
a
halfpenny
a
square
and
not
seldom
she
ate
four
or
even
six
of
these
squares
as
heavy
as
lead
making
this
her
dinner
a
cookshop
within
her
range
exhibited
at
midday
great
kept
hot
by
jets
of
steam
that
came
up
through
the
zinc
on
which
they
lay
this
food
was
cheap
and
satisfying
and
pennyloaf
often
regaled
both
herself
and
the
children
on
thick
slabs
of
it
also
attracted
her
she
fetched
it
from
the
in
a
little
basin
which
enabled
her
to
bring
away
at
the
same
time
a
spoonful
or
two
of
gravy
from
the
joints
of
which
she
was
not
rich
enough
to
purchase
a
cut
her
drink
was
tea
she
had
the
pot
on
the
table
all
day
and
kept
adding
hot
water
treacle
she
purchased
now
and
then
but
only
as
a
treat
when
her
dinner
had
cost
even
less
than
usual
she
did
not
venture
to
buy
more
than
a
couple
of
ounces
at
a
time
knowing
by
experience
that
she
could
not
resist
this
form
of
temptation
and
must
eat
and
eat
till
all
was
finished
bob
flung
sixpence
on
the
table
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
you
will
not
understand
him
if
you
fail
to
recognise
that
but
the
shame
only
served
to
make
him
fret
under
his
bondage
was
he
going
to
be
tied
to
pennyloaf
all
his
life
with
a
family
constantly
increasing
practically
he
had
already
made
a
resolve
to
be
free
before
very
long
the
way
was
not
quite
clear
to
him
as
yet
but
he
went
to
work
still
brooding
over
clem
words
of
the
night
before
pennyloaf
let
the
fire
go
out
locked
the
elder
child
into
the
room
for
safety
against
accidents
and
set
forth
for
the
hospital
it
rained
heavily
and
the
wind
rendered
her
umbrella
useless
she
had
to
stand
for
a
long
time
at
a
before
the
omnibus
came
the
water
soaked
into
her
leaky
shoes
but
that
did
matter
it
was
the
child
on
whose
account
she
was
anxious
having
reached
her
destination
she
sat
for
a
long
time
waiting
her
turn
among
the
numerous
just
as
the
opportunity
for
passing
into
the
doctor
room
arrived
a
movement
in
the
bundle
she
held
made
her
look
closely
at
the
face
at
that
instant
it
had
ceased
to
live
the
medical
man
behaved
kindly
to
her
but
she
gave
way
to
no
outburst
of
grief
with
tearless
eyes
she
stared
at
the
unmoving
body
in
a
sort
of
astonishment
the
questions
addressed
to
her
she
could
not
answer
with
any
intelligence
several
times
she
asked
stupidly
she
really
dead
there
was
nothing
to
wonder
at
however
the
doctor
glanced
at
the
paper
on
which
he
had
written
prescriptions
twice
or
thrice
during
the
past
few
weeks
and
found
the
event
natural
enough
towards
the
close
of
the
afternoon
pennyloaf
was
in
hanover
street
she
wished
to
see
jane
snowdon
but
had
a
fear
of
going
up
to
the
door
and
knocking
jane
might
not
be
at
home
and
if
she
were
pennyloaf
did
not
know
in
what
words
to
explain
her
coming
and
say
what
had
happened
she
was
in
a
dazed
heavy
state
indeed
she
did
not
clearly
remember
how
she
had
come
thus
far
or
what
she
had
done
since
leaving
the
hospital
at
midday
however
her
steps
drew
nearer
to
the
house
and
at
last
she
had
raised
the
knocker
just
raised
it
and
let
it
fall
byass
opened
she
did
not
know
pennyloaf
by
sight
the
latter
tried
to
say
something
but
only
stammered
a
meaningless
sound
thereupon
bessie
concluded
she
was
a
beggar
and
with
a
shake
of
the
head
shut
the
door
upon
her
pennyloaf
turned
away
in
confusion
and
dull
misery
she
walked
to
the
end
of
the
street
and
stood
there
on
leaving
home
she
had
forgotten
her
umbrella
and
now
it
was
raining
heavily
again
of
a
sudden
her
need
became
powerful
enough
to
overcome
all
obstacles
she
knew
that
she
see
jane
snowdon
that
she
could
not
go
home
till
she
had
done
so
jane
was
the
only
friend
she
had
the
only
creature
who
would
speak
the
kind
of
words
to
her
for
which
she
longed
again
the
knocker
fell
and
again
byass
appeared
do
you
want
i
got
nothing
for
you
she
cried
impatiently
want
to
see
miss
snowdon
please
mum
miss
snowdon
please
snowdon
then
why
did
you
say
so
step
inside
a
few
moments
and
jane
came
running
downstairs
ah
that
was
the
voice
that
did
good
how
it
comforted
and
blessed
after
the
hospital
and
the
miserable
room
in
which
the
dead
child
was
left
lying
and
the
rainy
street
chapter
xxx
on
a
barren
shore
about
this
time
scawthorne
received
one
morning
a
letter
which
though
not
unexpected
caused
him
some
annoyance
and
even
anxiety
it
was
signed
and
made
brief
request
for
an
interview
on
the
evening
of
the
next
day
at
waterloo
station
the
room
in
which
our
friend
sat
at
breakfast
was
of
such
very
modest
appearance
that
it
seemed
to
argue
but
poor
remuneration
for
the
services
rendered
by
him
in
the
office
of
percival
peel
it
was
a
parlour
on
the
second
floor
of
a
in
chelsea
scawthorne
graceful
person
and
professional
bearing
were
out
of
place
amid
the
trivial
appointments
he
lived
here
for
the
simple
reason
that
in
order
to
enjoy
a
few
of
the
luxuries
of
civilisation
he
had
to
spend
as
little
as
possible
on
bare
necessaries
his
habits
away
from
home
were
those
of
a
man
to
whom
a
few
pounds
are
no
serious
consideration
his
pleasant
dinner
at
the
restaurant
his
occasional
stall
at
a
theatre
his
easy
acquaintance
with
easy
livers
of
various
kinds
had
become
indispensable
to
him
and
as
a
matter
of
course
his
expenditure
increased
although
his
income
kept
at
the
same
figure
that
figure
was
not
contemptible
regard
had
to
the
path
by
which
he
had
come
thus
far
percival
esteemed
his
abilities
highly
and
behaved
to
him
with
generosity
ten
years
ago
scawthorne
would
have
lost
his
senses
with
joy
at
the
prospect
of
such
a
salary
he
found
it
miserably
insufficient
to
the
demands
he
made
upon
life
paltry
debts
harassed
him
inabilities
fretted
his
temperament
and
his
pride
it
irked
him
to
have
no
better
abode
than
this
musty
corner
to
which
he
could
never
invite
an
acquaintance
and
then
notwithstanding
his
mental
endowments
his
keen
social
sense
his
native
tact
in
all
london
not
one
refined
home
was
open
to
him
not
one
domestic
circle
of
educated
people
could
he
approach
and
find
a
welcome
scawthorne
was
passing
out
of
the
stage
when
a
man
seeks
only
the
gratification
of
his
propensities
he
began
to
focus
his
outlook
upon
the
world
and
to
feel
the
significance
of
maturity
the
double
existence
he
was
compelled
to
lead
that
of
a
laborious
and
man
of
business
in
office
hours
that
of
a
hungry
rascal
in
the
time
which
was
his
own
not
only
impressed
him
with
a
sense
of
danger
but
made
him
profoundly
dissatisfied
with
the
unreality
of
what
he
called
his
enjoyments
what
he
asked
himself
had
condemned
him
to
this
kind
of
career
simply
the
weight
under
which
he
started
his
poor
origin
his
miserable
youth
however
carefully
regulated
his
private
life
had
been
his
position
could
not
have
been
other
than
it
was
no
degree
of
purity
would
have
opened
to
him
the
door
of
a
civilised
house
suppose
he
had
wished
to
marry
where
pray
was
he
to
find
his
wife
a
barmaid
why
yes
other
men
of
his
standing
wedded
barmaids
and
girls
from
the
houses
of
business
and
so
on
but
they
had
neither
his
tastes
nor
his
brains
never
had
it
been
his
lot
to
exchange
a
word
with
an
educated
woman
save
in
the
office
on
rare
occasions
there
is
such
a
thing
as
in
the
cause
of
personal
integrity
another
man
might
have
said
to
himself
forbids
me
the
gratification
of
my
higher
instincts
and
i
must
be
content
to
live
a
life
of
barrenness
that
i
may
at
least
be
above
reproach
true
but
scawthorne
happened
not
to
be
so
made
he
was
of
the
rebels
of
the
earth
formerly
he
revolted
because
he
could
not
indulge
his
senses
to
their
full
at
present
his
ideal
was
changed
and
the
past
burdened
him
yesterday
he
had
had
an
interview
with
old
percival
which
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
opened
to
him
a
prospect
of
the
only
kind
of
advancement
conformable
with
his
higher
needs
the
firm
of
percival
peel
was
in
truth
percival
son
peel
having
been
dead
for
many
years
and
the
son
in
question
lacked
a
good
deal
of
being
the
capable
lawyer
whose
exertions
could
supplement
the
failing
energy
of
the
senior
partner
percival
having
pondered
the
matter
for
some
time
now
proposed
that
scawthorne
should
qualify
himself
for
admission
as
a
solicitor
the
circumstances
required
his
being
under
articles
for
three
years
only
and
then
if
everything
were
still
favourable
accept
a
junior
partnership
in
the
firm
such
an
offer
was
a
testimony
of
the
high
regard
in
which
scawthorne
was
held
by
his
employer
it
stirred
him
with
hope
he
had
never
dared
to
entertain
since
his
eyes
were
opened
to
the
realities
of
the
world
and
in
a
single
day
did
more
for
the
ripening
of
his
prudence
than
years
would
have
effected
had
his
position
remained
unaltered
scawthorne
realised
more
distinctly
what
a
hazardous
game
he
had
been
playing
and
here
was
this
brief
note
signed
an
ugly
affair
to
look
back
upon
all
that
connected
itself
with
those
initials
the
worst
of
it
was
that
it
could
not
be
regarded
as
done
with
had
he
anything
to
fear
from
directly
the
meeting
must
decide
that
he
felt
now
what
a
fortunate
thing
it
was
that
his
elaborate
plot
to
put
an
end
to
the
engagement
between
kirkwood
and
jane
snowdon
had
been
accidentally
frustrated
a
plot
which
have
availed
himself
nothing
even
had
it
succeeded
but
was
he
in
his
abandonment
of
rascality
in
general
to
think
no
more
of
the
fortune
which
had
so
long
kept
his
imagination
uneasy
had
he
not
rather
a
vastly
better
chance
of
getting
some
of
that
money
into
his
own
pocket
it
really
seemed
as
if
kirkwood
though
he
might
be
only
artful
had
relinquished
his
claim
on
the
girl
at
all
events
for
the
present
possibly
he
was
an
honest
man
which
would
explain
his
behaviour
michael
snowdon
could
not
live
much
longer
jane
would
be
the
ward
of
the
percivals
and
certainly
would
be
aided
to
a
position
more
correspondent
with
her
wealth
why
should
it
then
be
impossible
for
to
become
jane
husband
joseph
beyond
a
doubt
could
be
brought
to
favour
that
arrangement
by
means
of
a
private
understanding
more
advantageous
to
him
than
anything
he
could
reasonably
hope
from
the
girl
merely
remaining
unmarried
this
change
in
his
relations
to
the
percivals
would
so
far
improve
his
social
claims
that
many
of
the
difficulties
hitherto
besieging
such
a
scheme
as
this
might
easily
be
set
aside
come
come
the
atmosphere
was
clearing
joseph
himself
now
established
in
a
decent
business
would
become
less
a
than
an
ordinary
friend
bound
to
him
in
the
way
of
the
world
by
mutual
interests
things
must
be
put
in
order
by
some
device
the
need
of
secrecy
in
his
intercourse
with
joseph
must
come
to
an
end
in
fact
there
remained
but
two
hazardous
points
could
the
connection
between
jane
and
kirkwood
be
brought
definitely
to
an
end
and
was
anything
to
be
feared
from
poor
waterloo
station
is
a
convenient
rendezvous
its
irregular
form
provides
many
corners
of
retirement
recesses
where
talk
can
be
carried
on
in
something
like
privacy
to
one
of
these
secluded
spots
scawthorne
drew
aside
with
the
veiled
woman
who
met
him
at
the
entrance
from
waterloo
road
so
closely
was
her
face
shrouded
that
he
had
at
first
a
difficulty
in
catching
the
words
she
addressed
to
him
the
noise
of
an
engine
getting
up
steam
the
rattle
of
cabs
and
porters
barrows
the
tread
and
voices
of
a
multitude
of
people
made
fitting
accompaniment
to
a
dialogue
which
in
every
word
presupposed
the
corruptions
and
miseries
of
a
centre
of
modern
life
did
you
send
that
letter
to
my
father
was
clara
first
question
what
letter
it
you
who
let
him
know
about
me
not
how
should
i
have
known
his
address
when
i
saw
the
newspapers
i
went
down
to
bolton
and
made
inquiries
when
i
heard
your
father
had
been
i
concluded
you
had
yourself
sent
for
him
otherwise
i
should
of
course
have
tried
to
be
useful
to
you
in
some
way
as
it
was
i
supposed
you
would
scarcely
thank
me
for
coming
forward
it
might
or
might
not
be
the
truth
as
far
as
clara
was
able
to
decide
possibly
the
information
had
come
from
some
one
else
she
knew
him
well
enough
to
be
assured
by
his
tone
that
nothing
more
could
be
elicited
from
him
on
that
point
are
quite
recovered
i
hope
scawthorne
added
surveying
her
as
she
stood
in
the
obscurity
your
general
health
he
was
courteous
somewhat
distant
suppose
i
as
well
as
i
shall
ever
be
she
answered
coldly
asked
you
to
meet
me
because
i
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
you
spoke
of
in
your
last
letters
you
got
my
answer
i
suppose
i
received
your
answer
but
in
fact
it
too
late
the
time
has
gone
by
and
perhaps
i
was
a
little
hasty
in
the
hopes
i
held
out
i
had
partly
deceived
myself
mind
i
wish
to
know
what
it
was
she
said
ca
matter
now
well
there
no
harm
in
mentioning
it
naturally
you
went
out
of
your
way
to
suppose
it
was
something
dishonourable
nothing
of
the
kind
i
had
an
idea
that
you
might
come
to
terms
with
an
australian
who
was
looking
out
for
actresses
for
a
theatre
in
melbourne
that
was
all
but
he
was
quite
the
man
i
took
him
for
i
doubt
whether
it
could
have
been
made
as
profitable
as
i
thought
at
first
expect
me
to
believe
that
story
unless
you
like
it
some
time
since
you
put
any
faith
in
my
goodwill
the
only
reason
i
did
speak
plainly
was
because
i
felt
sure
that
the
mention
of
a
foreign
country
would
excite
your
suspicions
you
have
always
attributed
evil
motives
to
me
rather
than
good
however
this
is
not
the
time
to
speak
of
such
things
i
sympathise
with
you
deeply
will
you
tell
me
if
i
can
can
help
you
at
all
you
ca
i
wanted
to
make
quite
sure
that
you
were
what
i
thought
you
that
all
do
think
on
the
whole
you
have
any
reason
to
complain
of
on
my
part
i
secured
you
the
opportunities
that
are
so
hard
to
find
you
did
we
do
owe
each
other
anything
that
one
comfort
i
just
say
that
you
need
have
any
fear
i
shall
trouble
you
in
future
i
know
that
what
you
chiefly
thinking
about
misjudge
me
but
that
ca
be
helped
i
wish
very
much
it
were
in
my
power
to
be
of
use
to
you
you
on
that
last
note
of
irony
they
parted
true
enough
in
one
sense
that
there
remained
debt
on
neither
side
but
clara
for
all
the
fierce
ambition
which
had
brought
her
life
to
this
point
could
not
divest
herself
of
a
woman
instincts
that
simple
fact
explained
various
inconsistencies
in
her
behaviour
to
scawthorne
since
she
had
made
herself
independent
of
him
it
explained
also
why
this
final
interview
became
the
bitterest
charge
her
memory
preserved
against
him
her
existence
for
some
three
weeks
kept
so
gloomy
a
monotony
that
it
was
impossible
she
should
endure
it
much
longer
the
little
room
which
she
shared
at
night
with
annie
and
amy
was
her
cell
throughout
the
day
of
necessity
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
eagles
but
they
scarcely
saw
more
of
each
other
than
if
they
had
lived
in
different
tenements
on
the
same
staircase
she
had
offered
to
undertake
a
share
of
the
housework
but
her
father
knew
that
everything
of
the
kind
was
distasteful
to
her
and
eagles
continued
to
assist
amy
as
hitherto
to
save
trouble
she
came
into
the
middle
room
for
her
meals
at
these
times
always
keeping
as
much
of
her
face
as
possible
hidden
the
children
could
not
overcome
a
repulsion
a
fear
excited
by
her
veil
and
the
muteness
she
preserved
in
their
presence
several
nights
passed
before
little
annie
got
to
sleep
with
any
comfort
only
with
her
father
did
clara
hold
converse
in
the
evening
he
always
sat
alone
with
her
for
an
hour
she
went
out
perhaps
every
third
day
after
dark
stealing
silently
down
the
long
staircase
and
walking
rapidly
until
she
had
escaped
the
neighbourhood
like
john
hewett
when
formerly
he
wandered
forth
in
search
of
her
her
strength
was
slight
after
absence
she
came
back
so
wearied
that
the
ascent
of
stairs
cost
her
much
suffering
the
economy
prevailing
in
architecture
takes
good
care
that
no
depressing
circumstance
shall
be
absent
from
the
dwellings
in
which
the
poor
find
shelter
what
terrible
barracks
those
farringdon
road
buildings
vast
sheer
walls
unbroken
by
even
an
attempt
at
ornament
row
above
row
of
windows
in
the
surface
upwards
upwards
lifeless
eyes
murky
openings
that
tell
of
bareness
disorder
comfortlessness
within
one
is
tempted
to
say
that
shooter
gardens
are
a
preferable
abode
an
inner
courtyard
asphalted
swept
clean
looking
up
to
the
sky
as
from
a
prison
acres
of
these
edifices
the
tinge
of
grime
declaring
the
relative
dates
of
their
erection
millions
of
tons
of
brute
brick
and
mortar
crushing
the
spirit
as
you
gaze
barracks
in
truth
housing
for
the
army
of
industrialism
an
army
fighting
with
itself
rank
against
rank
man
against
man
that
the
survivors
may
have
whereon
to
feed
pass
by
in
the
night
and
strain
imagination
to
picture
the
weltering
mass
of
human
weariness
of
bestiality
of
unmerited
dolour
of
hopeless
hope
of
crushed
surrender
tumbled
together
within
those
forbidding
walls
clara
hated
the
place
from
her
first
hour
in
it
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
air
was
poisoned
with
the
odour
of
an
unclean
crowd
the
yells
of
children
at
play
in
the
courtyard
tortured
her
nerves
the
regular
sounds
on
the
staircase
day
after
day
repeated
at
the
same
hours
incidents
of
the
life
of
poverty
irritated
her
sick
brain
and
filled
her
with
despair
to
think
that
as
long
as
she
lived
she
could
never
hope
to
rise
again
above
this
world
to
which
she
was
born
gone
for
ever
for
ever
the
promise
that
always
gleamed
before
her
whilst
she
had
youth
and
beauty
and
talent
with
the
one
she
felt
as
though
she
had
been
robbed
of
all
three
blessings
her
twenty
years
were
now
a
meaningless
figure
the
energies
of
her
mind
could
avail
no
more
than
an
idiot
mummery
for
the
author
of
her
calamity
she
nourished
no
memory
of
hatred
her
resentment
was
against
the
fate
which
had
cursed
her
existence
from
its
beginning
for
this
she
had
dared
everything
had
made
the
supreme
sacrifice
conscience
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
but
she
felt
herself
an
outcast
even
among
these
wretched
toilers
whose
swarming
aroused
her
disgust
given
the
success
which
had
been
all
but
in
her
grasp
and
triumphant
pride
would
have
scored
out
every
misgiving
as
to
the
cost
at
which
the
victory
had
been
won
her
pride
was
unbroken
under
the
stress
of
anguish
it
became
a
scorn
for
goodness
and
humility
but
in
the
desolation
of
her
future
she
read
a
punishment
equal
to
the
daring
wherewith
she
had
aspired
excepting
her
poor
old
father
not
a
living
soul
that
held
account
of
her
she
might
live
for
years
and
years
her
father
would
die
and
then
no
smallest
tribute
of
love
or
admiration
would
be
hers
for
ever
more
than
that
perforce
she
must
gain
her
own
living
and
in
doing
so
she
must
expose
herself
to
all
manner
of
insulting
wonder
and
pity
was
it
a
life
that
could
be
lived
hour
after
hour
she
sat
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
she
did
not
weep
tears
were
trivial
before
a
destiny
such
as
this
but
groans
and
smothered
cries
often
broke
the
silence
of
her
solitude
cries
of
frenzied
revolt
wordless
curses
once
she
rose
up
suddenly
passed
through
the
middle
room
and
out
on
to
the
staircase
there
a
gap
in
the
wall
guarded
by
iron
railings
looked
down
upon
the
courtyard
she
leaned
forward
over
the
bar
and
measured
the
distance
that
separated
her
from
the
ground
a
ghastly
height
surely
one
would
not
feel
much
after
such
a
fall
in
any
case
the
crashing
agony
of
but
an
instant
had
not
this
place
tempted
other
people
before
now
some
one
coming
upstairs
made
her
shrink
back
into
her
room
she
had
felt
the
horrible
fascination
of
that
sheer
depth
and
thought
of
it
for
days
thought
of
it
until
she
dreaded
to
quit
the
tenement
lest
a
power
distinct
from
will
should
seize
and
hurl
her
to
destruction
she
knew
that
that
must
not
happen
here
for
all
her
she
could
not
visit
with
such
cruelty
the
one
heart
that
loved
her
and
thinking
of
him
she
understood
that
her
father
tenderness
was
not
wholly
the
idle
thing
that
it
had
been
to
her
at
first
her
love
could
never
equal
his
had
never
done
so
in
her
childhood
but
she
grew
conscious
of
a
soothing
power
in
the
gentle
and
timid
devotion
with
which
he
tended
her
his
appearance
of
an
evening
was
something
more
than
a
relief
after
the
waste
of
hours
which
made
her
day
the
rough
passionate
man
made
himself
as
quiet
and
sympathetic
as
a
girl
when
he
took
his
place
by
her
compared
with
her
his
other
children
were
as
nothing
to
him
impossible
that
clara
should
not
be
touched
by
the
sense
that
he
who
had
everything
to
forgive
whom
she
had
despised
and
abandoned
behaved
now
as
one
whose
part
it
is
to
beseech
forgiveness
she
became
less
impatient
when
he
tried
to
draw
her
into
conversation
when
he
held
her
thin
soft
hand
in
those
rude
ones
of
his
she
knew
a
solace
in
which
there
was
something
of
gratitude
yet
it
was
john
who
revived
her
misery
in
its
worst
form
pitying
her
unoccupied
loneliness
he
brought
home
one
day
a
book
that
he
had
purchased
from
a
stall
in
farringdon
street
it
was
a
novel
with
a
picture
on
the
cover
which
seemed
designed
to
repel
any
person
not
wholly
without
taste
and
might
perhaps
serve
the
end
of
averting
her
thoughts
from
their
one
subject
clara
viewed
it
contemptuously
but
made
a
show
of
being
thankful
and
on
the
next
day
she
did
glance
at
its
pages
the
story
was
better
than
its
illustration
it
took
a
hold
upon
her
she
read
all
day
long
but
when
she
returned
to
herself
it
was
to
find
that
she
had
been
exasperating
her
heart
malady
the
book
dealt
with
people
of
wealth
and
refinement
with
the
world
to
which
she
had
all
her
life
been
aspiring
and
to
which
she
might
have
attained
the
meanness
of
her
surroundings
became
in
comparison
more
mean
the
bitterness
of
her
fate
more
bitter
you
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
since
abandoning
her
existence
clara
had
been
constantly
educating
herself
not
only
by
direct
study
of
books
but
through
her
association
with
people
her
growth
in
experience
where
in
the
old
days
of
rebellion
she
had
only
an
instinct
a
divination
to
guide
her
there
was
now
just
enough
of
knowledge
to
give
occupation
to
her
developed
intellect
and
taste
far
keener
was
her
sense
of
the
loss
she
had
suffered
than
her
former
longing
for
what
she
knew
only
in
dream
the
activity
of
her
mind
received
a
new
impulse
when
she
broke
free
from
scawthorne
and
began
her
upward
struggle
in
independence
whatever
books
were
obtainable
she
read
greedily
she
purchased
numbers
of
plays
in
the
and
studied
with
the
utmost
earnestness
such
parts
as
she
knew
by
repute
no
actress
entertained
a
more
superb
ambition
none
was
more
vividly
conscious
of
power
but
it
was
not
only
at
that
clara
aimed
glorious
in
itself
this
was
also
to
serve
her
as
a
means
of
becoming
nationalised
among
that
race
of
beings
whom
birth
and
breeding
exalt
above
the
multitude
a
notable
illusion
pathetic
to
dwell
upon
as
a
she
nourished
envious
hatred
of
those
the
world
taught
her
to
call
superiors
they
were
then
as
remote
and
unknown
to
her
as
gods
on
olympus
from
her
place
behind
the
footlights
she
surveyed
the
occupants
of
boxes
and
stalls
in
a
changed
spirit
the
distance
was
no
longer
insuperable
she
heard
of
fortunate
players
who
mingled
on
equal
terms
with
men
and
women
of
refinement
there
she
imagined
was
her
ultimate
goal
is
to
that
i
belong
be
my
origin
what
it
may
i
have
the
intelligence
and
the
desires
of
one
born
to
freedom
nothing
in
me
nothing
is
akin
to
that
gross
world
from
which
i
have
escaped
so
she
thought
with
every
drop
of
her
heart
blood
crying
its
source
from
that
red
fountain
of
revolt
whereon
never
yet
did
the
upper
daylight
gleam
brain
and
pulses
such
as
hers
belong
not
to
the
mild
breed
of
mortals
fostered
in
sunshine
but
for
the
stroke
of
fate
she
might
have
won
that
reception
which
was
in
her
dream
and
with
what
when
experience
had
matured
itself
never
yet
did
true
rebel
who
has
burst
the
barriers
of
social
limitation
find
aught
but
in
the
trim
gardens
beyond
when
john
asked
if
the
book
had
given
her
amusement
she
said
that
reading
made
her
eyes
ache
he
noticed
that
her
hand
felt
feverish
and
that
the
dark
mood
had
fallen
upon
her
as
badly
as
ever
just
what
i
said
she
exclaimed
with
abruptness
after
long
refusal
to
speak
knew
your
friend
would
never
come
as
long
as
i
was
here
john
regarded
her
anxiously
the
phrase
friend
had
a
peculiar
sound
that
disturbed
him
it
made
him
aware
that
she
had
been
thinking
often
of
sidney
kirkwood
since
his
name
had
been
dismissed
from
their
conversation
he
too
had
often
turned
his
mind
uneasily
in
the
same
direction
wondering
whether
he
ought
to
have
spoken
of
sidney
so
freely
at
the
time
it
seemed
best
indeed
almost
inevitable
but
habit
and
the
force
of
affection
were
changing
his
view
of
clara
in
several
respects
he
recognised
the
impossibility
of
her
continuing
to
live
as
now
yet
it
was
as
difficult
as
ever
to
conceive
a
means
of
aiding
her
unavoidably
he
kept
glancing
towards
kirkwood
he
knew
that
sidney
was
no
longer
a
free
man
he
knew
that
even
had
it
been
otherwise
clara
could
be
nothing
to
him
in
spite
of
facts
the
father
kept
brooding
on
what
might
have
been
his
own
love
was
perdurable
how
could
it
other
than
intensify
when
its
object
was
so
unhappy
his
hot
illogical
mood
all
but
brought
about
a
revival
of
the
old
resentment
against
sidney
have
seen
him
for
a
week
or
two
he
replied
in
an
embarrassed
way
he
tell
you
he
should
come
after
we
talked
about
it
you
know
when
you
told
me
you
mind
i
just
said
a
word
or
two
and
he
nodded
that
was
all
she
became
silent
john
racked
by
doubts
as
to
whether
he
should
say
more
of
sidney
or
still
hold
his
peace
sat
rubbing
the
back
of
one
hand
with
the
other
and
looking
about
the
room
clara
resumed
presently
became
of
that
child
at
peckover
that
her
grandfather
came
and
took
away
snowdon
yes
that
was
her
name
jane
snowdon
remember
they
went
to
live
with
somebody
you
used
to
know
john
replied
with
hesitation
still
in
the
same
house
she
grown
up
did
you
ever
hear
about
that
old
man
having
a
lot
of
money
my
dear
i
never
heard
nothing
but
what
them
peckovers
talked
at
the
time
but
there
was
a
son
of
his
turned
up
as
seemed
to
have
some
money
he
married
peckover
daughter
clara
expressed
surprise
son
of
his
not
the
girl
father
her
father
i
do
know
nothing
about
his
history
it
for
him
or
partly
for
him
as
i
workin
now
clara
the
firm
lake
snowdon
did
you
mention
it
before
do
hardly
know
my
dear
she
looked
at
him
aware
that
something
was
being
kept
back
me
about
the
girl
what
does
she
do
goes
to
work
i
believe
but
i
have
heard
much
about
her
since
a
good
time
sidney
kirkwood
a
friend
of
her
grandfather
he
often
goes
there
i
believe
is
she
like
clara
asked
after
a
pause
used
to
be
such
a
weak
ailing
thing
i
never
thought
she
grow
up
what
she
like
to
look
at
ca
tell
you
my
dear
i
do
know
as
ever
i
see
her
since
those
times
again
a
silence
it
kirkwood
that
has
told
you
what
you
know
of
her
no
it
was
chiefly
peckover
told
me
she
did
say
clara
but
then
i
ca
tell
whether
it
true
or
not
she
did
say
something
about
sidney
and
her
he
spoke
with
difficulty
feeling
constrained
to
make
the
disclosure
but
anxious
as
to
its
result
clara
made
no
movement
seemed
to
have
heard
with
indifference
maybe
partly
of
that
added
john
in
a
low
voice
he
does
like
to
come
here
i
understand
they
spoke
no
more
on
the
subject
chapter
xxxi
woman
and
actress
in
a
tenement
on
the
same
staircase
two
floors
below
lived
a
family
with
whom
john
hewett
was
on
friendly
terms
necessity
calling
these
people
out
of
london
for
a
few
days
they
had
left
with
john
the
key
of
their
front
door
a
letter
of
some
moment
might
arrive
in
their
absence
and
john
undertook
to
it
to
them
the
key
was
hung
on
a
nail
in
clara
room
just
go
down
and
see
if
the
postman
left
anything
at
this
morning
said
amy
hewett
coming
in
between
breakfast
and
the
time
of
starting
for
school
she
reached
up
to
the
key
but
clara
who
sat
by
the
fire
with
a
cup
of
tea
on
her
lap
the
only
breakfast
she
ever
took
surprised
her
by
saying
need
trouble
amy
i
shall
be
going
out
soon
and
look
in
as
i
pass
the
girl
was
disappointed
for
she
liked
this
private
incursion
into
the
abode
of
other
people
but
the
expression
of
a
purpose
by
her
sister
was
so
unusual
that
after
a
moment
hesitating
she
said
well
and
left
the
room
again
when
silence
informed
clara
that
the
children
were
gone
eagles
being
the
only
person
besides
herself
who
remained
in
the
tenement
she
put
on
her
hat
drew
down
the
veil
which
was
always
attached
to
it
and
with
the
key
in
her
hand
descended
to
the
hollands
rooms
had
a
letter
been
delivered
that
morning
it
would
have
been
in
default
of
box
just
inside
the
door
there
was
none
but
clara
seemed
to
have
another
purpose
in
view
she
closed
the
door
and
walked
forward
into
the
nearest
room
the
blind
was
down
but
the
dusk
thus
produced
was
familiar
to
her
in
consequence
of
her
own
habit
and
her
veil
thrown
back
she
examined
the
chamber
thoughtfully
it
was
a
ugly
orderly
the
air
felt
damp
and
even
in
she
was
conscious
of
the
layers
of
london
dust
which
had
softly
deposited
themselves
since
the
family
went
away
hours
ago
a
fire
was
laid
ready
for
lighting
and
the
smell
of
moist
soot
spread
from
the
grate
having
stood
on
one
spot
for
nearly
ten
minutes
clara
made
a
quick
movement
and
withdrew
she
latched
the
front
door
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
ran
upstairs
and
shut
herself
again
in
her
own
room
presently
she
was
standing
at
her
window
the
blind
partly
raised
on
a
clear
day
the
view
from
this
room
was
of
wide
extent
embracing
a
great
part
of
the
city
seen
under
a
low
blurred
dripping
sky
through
the
ragged
patches
of
smoke
from
chimneys
innumerable
it
had
a
gloomy
impressiveness
well
in
keeping
with
the
mind
of
her
who
brooded
over
it
directly
in
front
rising
from
the
lower
masses
of
building
stood
in
black
majesty
the
dome
of
paul
its
vastness
suffered
no
diminution
from
this
high
outlook
rather
was
exaggerated
by
the
flying
scraps
of
mirky
vapour
which
softened
its
outline
and
at
times
gave
it
the
appearance
of
floating
on
a
vague
troubled
sea
somewhat
nearer
amid
many
spires
and
steeples
lay
the
surly
bulk
of
newgate
the
lines
of
its
construction
shown
its
little
windows
multiplied
for
points
of
torment
to
the
vision
nearer
again
the
markets
of
smithfield
bartholomew
hospital
the
tract
of
modern
deformity
cleft
by
a
gulf
of
railway
which
spreads
between
clerkenwell
road
and
charterhouse
street
down
in
farringdon
street
the
carts
waggons
vans
cabs
omnibuses
crossed
and
intermingled
in
a
steaming
of
mud
human
beings
reduced
to
their
due
paltriness
seemed
to
toil
in
exasperation
along
the
strips
of
pavement
bound
on
errands
which
were
a
mockery
driven
by
forces
they
neither
understood
nor
could
resist
i
go
out
into
a
world
like
that
alone
was
the
thought
which
made
clara
spirit
fail
as
she
stood
gazing
i
face
life
as
it
is
for
women
who
grow
old
in
earning
bare
daily
bread
among
those
terrible
streets
year
after
year
to
go
in
and
out
from
some
wretched
garret
that
i
call
home
with
my
face
hidden
my
heart
stabbed
with
misery
till
it
is
cold
and
bloodless
then
her
eye
fell
upon
the
spire
of
james
church
on
clerkenwell
green
whose
bells
used
to
be
so
familiar
to
her
the
memory
was
only
of
discontent
and
futile
aspiration
but
oh
if
it
were
possible
to
be
again
as
she
was
then
and
yet
keep
the
experience
with
which
life
had
since
endowed
her
with
no
moral
condemnation
did
she
view
the
records
of
her
rebellion
but
how
easy
to
see
now
that
ignorance
had
been
one
of
the
worst
obstacles
in
her
path
and
that
like
all
unadvised
purchasers
she
had
paid
a
price
that
might
well
have
been
spared
a
little
more
craft
a
little
more
patience
it
is
with
these
that
the
world
is
conquered
the
world
was
her
enemy
and
had
proved
too
strong
woman
though
she
was
only
a
girl
striving
to
attain
the
place
for
which
birth
adapted
her
pursuing
only
her
irrepressible
instincts
fate
flung
her
to
the
ground
pitilessly
and
bade
her
live
out
the
rest
of
her
time
in
wretchedness
no
there
remained
one
more
endeavour
that
was
possible
to
her
one
bare
hope
of
saving
herself
from
the
extremity
which
only
now
she
estimated
at
its
full
horror
if
that
failed
why
then
there
was
a
way
to
cure
all
ills
from
her
box
that
in
which
were
hidden
away
many
mementoes
of
her
life
as
an
actress
she
took
out
a
sheet
of
notepaper
and
an
envelope
without
much
thought
she
wrote
nearly
three
pages
folded
the
letter
addressed
it
with
a
name
only
kirkwood
sidney
address
she
did
not
know
her
father
had
mentioned
red
lion
street
that
was
all
she
did
not
even
know
whether
he
still
worked
at
the
old
place
but
in
that
way
she
must
try
to
find
him
she
cloaked
herself
took
her
umbrella
and
went
out
at
a
corner
of
john
square
she
soon
found
an
urchin
who
would
run
an
errand
for
her
he
was
to
take
this
note
to
a
house
that
she
indicated
and
to
ask
if
kirkwood
was
working
there
she
scarcely
durst
hope
to
see
the
messenger
returning
with
empty
hands
but
he
did
so
a
terrible
throbbing
at
her
heart
she
went
home
again
in
the
evening
when
her
father
returned
she
surprised
him
by
saying
that
she
expected
a
visitor
you
want
me
to
go
out
of
the
way
he
asked
eager
to
submit
to
her
in
everything
i
asked
my
friend
to
come
to
holland
i
thought
there
would
be
no
great
harm
i
shall
go
down
just
before
nine
no
there
no
harm
conceded
her
father
only
if
the
neighbours
opposite
got
talkin
to
them
when
they
come
back
ca
help
it
they
wo
mind
i
ca
help
it
john
noticed
her
agitated
repetition
the
impatience
with
which
she
flung
aside
difficulties
it
ai
anything
about
work
my
dear
father
i
would
do
anything
without
telling
you
i
promised
i
do
care
it
all
right
she
had
begun
to
speak
immediately
on
his
entering
the
room
and
so
it
happened
that
he
had
not
kissed
her
as
he
always
did
at
when
she
had
sat
down
he
came
with
awkwardness
and
timidity
and
bent
his
face
to
hers
a
hot
cheek
it
is
my
little
girl
he
murmured
do
like
it
you
got
a
bit
of
fever
hangin
about
you
she
wished
to
be
alone
the
children
must
not
come
into
the
room
until
she
had
gone
downstairs
when
her
father
had
left
her
she
seated
herself
before
the
abhorrent
as
it
was
to
her
to
look
thus
in
her
own
face
and
began
dressing
her
hair
with
quite
unusual
attention
this
beauty
at
least
remained
to
her
arranged
as
she
had
learned
to
do
it
for
the
stage
the
dark
abundance
of
her
tresses
crowned
nobly
the
head
which
once
held
itself
with
such
defiant
grace
she
did
not
change
her
dress
which
though
it
had
suffered
from
wear
was
and
of
better
material
than
farringdon
road
buildings
were
wont
to
see
a
sober
draping
which
became
her
tall
elegance
as
she
moved
at
a
quarter
to
nine
she
arranged
the
veil
upon
her
head
so
that
she
could
throw
her
hat
aside
without
disturbing
it
then
taking
the
lamp
in
her
hand
and
the
key
of
the
hollands
door
she
went
forth
no
one
met
her
on
the
stairs
she
was
safe
in
the
cold
deserted
parlour
where
she
had
stood
this
morning
cold
doubtless
but
she
could
not
be
conscious
of
it
in
her
veins
there
seemed
rather
to
be
fire
than
blood
her
brain
was
clear
but
in
an
unnatural
way
the
throbbing
at
her
temples
ought
to
have
been
painful
but
only
excited
her
with
a
strange
intensity
of
thought
and
she
felt
amid
it
all
a
dread
of
what
was
before
her
only
the
fever
to
which
she
abandoned
herself
with
a
sort
of
reckless
confidence
a
faith
that
it
would
continue
till
this
interview
was
over
overcame
an
impulse
to
rush
back
into
her
to
bury
herself
in
shame
or
desperately
whelm
her
wretchedness
in
the
final
oblivion
he
was
very
punctual
the
heavy
bell
of
paul
had
not
reached
its
ninth
stroke
when
she
heard
his
knock
at
the
door
he
came
in
without
speaking
and
stood
as
if
afraid
to
look
at
her
the
lamp
placed
on
a
barely
disclosed
all
the
objects
within
the
four
walls
it
illumined
sidney
face
but
clara
moved
so
that
she
was
in
shadow
she
began
to
speak
understood
my
note
the
people
who
live
here
are
away
and
i
have
ventured
to
borrow
their
room
they
are
friends
of
my
father
at
the
first
word
he
was
surprised
by
the
change
in
her
voice
and
accentuation
her
speech
was
that
of
an
educated
woman
the
melody
which
always
had
such
a
charm
for
him
had
gained
wonderfully
in
richness
yet
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
commanded
utterance
and
her
agitation
touched
him
in
a
way
quite
other
than
he
was
prepared
for
in
truth
he
knew
not
what
experience
he
had
anticipated
but
the
reality
now
that
it
came
this
unimaginable
blending
of
memory
with
the
unfamiliar
this
refinement
of
something
that
he
had
loved
this
note
of
pity
struck
within
him
by
such
subtle
means
affected
his
inmost
self
immediately
he
laid
stern
control
upon
his
feelings
but
all
the
words
which
he
had
designed
to
speak
were
driven
from
memory
he
could
say
nothing
could
only
glance
at
her
veiled
face
and
await
what
she
had
to
ask
of
him
you
sit
down
i
shall
feel
grateful
if
you
can
spare
me
a
few
minutes
i
have
asked
you
to
see
me
because
indeed
because
i
am
sadly
in
want
of
the
kind
of
help
a
friend
might
give
me
i
do
venture
to
call
you
that
but
i
thought
of
you
i
hoped
you
would
refuse
to
let
me
speak
to
you
i
am
in
such
difficulties
such
a
hard
position
may
be
very
sure
i
will
do
anything
i
can
to
be
of
use
to
you
sidney
replied
his
thick
voice
contrasting
so
strongly
with
that
which
had
just
failed
into
silence
that
he
coughed
and
lowered
his
tone
after
the
first
few
syllables
he
meant
to
express
himself
without
a
hint
of
emotion
but
it
was
beyond
his
power
the
words
in
which
she
spoke
of
her
calamity
seemed
so
pathetically
simple
that
they
went
to
his
heart
clara
had
recovered
all
her
faculties
the
fever
and
the
anguish
and
the
dread
were
no
whit
diminished
but
they
helped
instead
of
checking
her
an
actress
improvising
her
part
she
regulated
every
tone
with
perfect
skill
with
inspiration
the
very
attitude
in
which
she
seated
herself
was
a
triumph
of
the
artist
felicity
just
said
a
word
or
two
in
my
note
she
resumed
you
might
have
replied
if
you
thought
nothing
could
be
gained
by
my
speaking
to
you
i
could
explain
fully
what
i
had
in
mind
i
do
know
that
i
anything
very
clear
to
say
even
now
but
you
know
what
has
happened
to
me
you
know
that
i
have
nothing
to
look
forward
to
that
i
can
only
hope
to
keep
from
being
a
burden
to
my
father
i
am
getting
stronger
it
time
i
tried
to
find
something
to
do
but
i
her
voice
failed
again
sidney
gazed
at
her
and
saw
the
dull
lamplight
just
glisten
on
her
hair
she
was
bending
forward
a
little
her
hands
joined
and
resting
on
her
knee
you
thought
what
kind
of
of
work
would
be
best
for
you
sidney
asked
the
stuck
in
his
throat
and
he
seemed
to
himself
brutal
in
his
way
of
uttering
it
but
he
was
glad
when
he
had
put
the
question
thus
directly
one
at
least
of
his
resolves
was
carried
out
know
i
no
right
to
choose
when
there
necessity
she
answered
in
a
very
low
tone
women
would
naturally
think
of
needlework
but
i
know
so
little
of
it
i
scarcely
ever
did
any
if
i
could
i
might
perhaps
do
that
at
home
and
i
feel
if
i
could
only
avoid
if
i
could
only
be
spared
going
among
strangers
her
faltering
voice
sank
lower
and
lower
she
seemed
as
if
she
would
have
hidden
her
face
even
under
its
veil
feel
sure
you
will
have
no
difficulty
sidney
hastened
to
reply
his
own
voice
unsteady
you
can
get
work
at
home
why
do
you
trouble
yourself
with
the
thought
of
going
among
strangers
never
be
the
least
need
for
that
i
sure
there
wo
have
you
spoken
about
it
to
your
father
but
he
is
so
kind
to
me
that
he
wo
hear
of
work
at
all
it
was
partly
on
that
account
that
i
took
the
step
of
appealing
to
you
he
does
know
who
i
am
meeting
here
would
you
i
do
know
whether
i
ought
to
ask
but
perhaps
if
you
spoke
to
him
in
a
day
or
two
and
made
him
understand
how
strong
my
wish
is
he
dreads
lest
we
should
be
parted
but
i
hope
i
shall
never
have
to
leave
him
and
then
of
course
father
is
not
very
well
able
to
advise
me
about
work
i
mean
you
have
more
experience
i
am
so
helpless
oh
if
you
knew
how
helpless
i
feel
you
really
wish
it
i
will
talk
with
your
father
i
do
wish
it
my
coming
to
live
here
has
made
everything
so
uncomfortable
for
him
and
the
children
even
his
friends
ca
visit
him
as
they
would
i
feel
that
though
he
wo
admit
that
it
made
any
difference
sidney
looked
to
the
ground
he
heard
her
voice
falter
as
it
continued
i
to
live
here
still
it
must
be
at
the
cost
of
all
his
comfort
i
keep
almost
always
in
the
one
room
i
should
be
in
the
way
if
anyone
came
i
been
afraid
kirkwood
that
perhaps
you
feared
to
come
lest
whilst
i
was
not
very
well
it
might
have
been
an
inconvenience
to
us
please
do
think
that
i
shall
never
see
either
friends
or
strangers
unless
it
is
absolutely
needful
there
was
silence
do
feel
much
better
i
hope
fell
from
sidney
lips
stronger
it
only
my
mind
everything
is
so
dark
to
me
you
know
how
little
patience
i
always
had
it
was
enough
if
any
one
said
do
this
or
put
up
with
that
at
once
i
resisted
it
was
my
nature
i
could
bear
the
feeling
of
control
that
what
i
had
to
struggle
with
since
i
recovered
from
my
delirium
at
the
hospital
and
had
even
the
hope
of
dying
can
you
put
yourself
in
my
place
and
imagine
what
i
have
suffered
sidney
was
silent
his
own
life
had
not
been
without
its
passionate
miseries
but
the
modulations
of
this
voice
which
had
no
light
of
countenance
to
aid
it
raised
him
above
the
plane
of
common
experience
and
made
actual
to
him
the
feelings
he
knew
only
in
romantic
story
he
could
not
stir
lest
the
slightest
sound
should
jar
on
her
speaking
his
breath
rose
visibly
upon
the
chill
air
but
the
discomfort
of
the
room
was
as
indifferent
to
him
as
to
his
companion
clara
rose
as
if
impelled
by
mental
anguish
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
the
and
so
stood
between
him
and
the
light
her
admirable
figure
designed
on
a
glimmering
background
know
why
you
say
nothing
she
continued
abruptly
but
without
resentment
can
not
use
words
of
sympathy
which
would
be
anything
but
formal
and
you
prefer
to
let
me
understand
that
it
is
like
you
oh
you
must
think
i
mean
the
phrase
as
a
reproach
anything
but
that
i
mean
that
you
were
always
honest
and
time
has
changed
you
in
that
a
slight
very
slight
tremor
on
the
close
rather
you
behaved
to
me
like
your
old
self
a
sham
sympathy
would
drive
me
mad
said
nothing
he
replied
because
words
seemed
meaningless
only
that
you
feel
for
me
i
know
because
you
are
not
heartless
but
at
the
same
time
you
obey
your
reason
which
tells
you
that
all
i
suffer
comes
of
my
own
should
like
you
to
think
better
of
me
than
that
i
not
one
of
those
people
i
hope
who
use
every
accident
to
point
a
moral
and
begin
by
inventing
the
moral
to
suit
their
own
convictions
i
know
all
the
details
of
your
misfortune
was
it
cruel
that
she
should
take
such
revenge
upon
me
her
voice
rose
in
unrestrained
emotion
because
she
envied
me
that
poor
bit
of
advantage
over
her
how
could
i
be
expected
to
refuse
the
chance
that
was
offered
it
would
have
been
no
use
she
could
have
kept
the
part
and
i
was
so
near
success
i
had
never
had
a
chance
of
showing
what
i
could
do
it
was
much
of
a
part
really
but
it
was
the
lead
at
all
events
and
it
would
have
made
people
pay
attention
to
me
you
do
know
how
strongly
i
was
always
drawn
to
the
stage
there
i
found
the
work
for
which
i
was
meant
and
i
strove
so
hard
to
make
my
way
i
had
no
friends
no
money
i
earned
only
just
enough
to
supply
my
needs
i
know
what
people
think
about
actresses
kirkwood
do
you
imagine
i
have
been
living
at
my
ease
congratulating
myself
that
i
had
escaped
from
all
hardships
he
could
not
raise
his
eyes
as
she
still
awaited
his
answer
he
said
in
rather
a
hard
voice
i
have
told
you
i
read
all
the
details
that
were
published
you
know
that
i
was
working
hard
and
honestly
working
far
far
harder
than
when
i
lived
in
clerkenwell
close
but
i
do
know
why
i
am
talking
to
you
about
it
it
all
over
i
went
my
own
way
and
i
all
but
won
what
i
fought
for
you
may
very
well
say
what
the
use
of
mourning
over
one
fate
sidney
had
risen
were
strong
in
your
resolve
to
succeed
he
said
gravely
you
will
find
strength
to
meet
even
this
trial
weaker
woman
would
suffer
far
less
one
with
a
little
more
strength
of
character
would
kill
herself
in
that
you
mistake
you
have
not
yourself
only
to
think
of
it
would
be
an
easy
thing
to
put
an
end
to
your
life
you
have
a
duty
to
your
father
she
bent
her
head
think
of
him
he
is
goodness
itself
to
me
there
are
fathers
who
would
have
shut
the
door
in
my
face
i
know
better
now
than
i
could
when
i
was
only
a
child
how
hard
his
life
has
been
he
and
i
are
like
each
other
so
many
ways
he
has
always
been
fighting
against
cruel
circumstances
it
right
that
you
who
have
been
his
true
and
helpful
friend
should
remind
me
of
my
duty
to
him
a
pause
then
sidney
asked
you
wish
me
to
speak
to
him
very
soon
about
your
finding
occupation
you
will
if
you
could
think
of
anything
he
moved
but
still
delayed
his
offer
to
take
leave
said
just
now
clara
continued
falteringly
you
did
not
try
to
express
sympathy
because
words
seemed
of
no
use
how
am
i
to
find
words
of
thanks
to
you
for
coming
here
and
listening
to
what
i
had
to
say
surely
so
simple
an
act
of
friendship
i
so
many
friends
and
what
right
have
i
to
look
to
you
for
an
act
of
kindness
did
i
merit
it
by
my
words
when
i
last
there
came
a
marvellous
change
a
change
such
as
it
needed
either
exquisite
feeling
or
the
genius
of
simulation
to
express
by
means
so
simple
unable
to
show
him
by
a
smile
by
a
light
in
her
eyes
what
mood
had
come
upon
her
what
subtle
shifting
in
the
direction
of
her
thought
had
checked
her
words
by
her
mere
movement
as
she
stepped
lightly
towards
him
by
the
carriage
of
her
head
by
her
hands
half
held
out
and
half
drawn
back
again
she
prepared
him
for
what
she
was
about
to
say
no
piece
of
acting
was
ever
more
delicately
finished
he
knew
that
she
smiled
though
nothing
of
her
face
was
visible
he
knew
that
her
look
was
one
of
diffident
pleasure
and
then
came
the
sweetness
of
her
accents
timorous
joyful
scarcely
to
be
recognised
as
the
voice
which
an
instant
ago
had
trembled
sadly
in
that
seems
to
you
so
long
ago
does
it
you
can
forgive
me
now
father
has
told
me
what
happiness
you
have
found
and
i
i
am
so
glad
sidney
drew
back
a
step
involuntarily
the
movement
came
of
the
shock
with
which
he
heard
her
make
such
confident
reference
to
the
supposed
relations
between
himself
and
jane
snowdon
he
reddened
stood
mute
for
a
few
seconds
his
mind
was
in
the
most
painful
whirl
and
conflict
a
hundred
impressions
arguments
apprehensions
crowded
upon
him
each
with
its
puncturing
torment
and
clara
stood
there
waiting
for
his
reply
in
the
attitude
of
consummate
grace
course
i
know
what
you
speak
of
he
said
at
length
with
the
bluntness
of
confusion
your
father
was
mistaken
i
do
know
who
can
have
led
him
to
believe
that
it
a
mistake
altogether
sidney
would
not
have
believed
that
anyone
could
so
completely
rob
him
of
least
of
all
clara
hewett
his
face
grew
still
more
heated
he
was
angry
with
he
knew
not
whom
he
knew
not
why
perhaps
with
himself
in
the
first
instance
mistake
clara
murmured
under
her
breath
you
mean
people
have
been
too
hasty
in
speaking
about
it
do
pardon
me
i
ought
never
to
have
taken
such
a
liberty
but
i
felt
she
hesitated
was
no
liberty
at
all
i
dare
say
the
mistake
is
natural
enough
to
those
who
know
nothing
of
miss
snowdon
circumstances
i
myself
however
have
no
right
to
talk
about
her
but
what
you
have
been
told
is
absolute
error
clara
walked
a
few
paces
aside
i
ask
you
to
forgive
me
her
tones
had
not
the
same
clearness
as
hitherto
any
case
i
had
no
right
to
approach
such
a
subject
in
speaking
with
you
us
put
it
aside
said
sidney
mastering
himself
were
just
agreeing
that
i
should
see
your
father
and
make
known
your
wish
to
him
you
i
shall
tell
him
when
i
go
upstairs
that
you
were
the
friend
whom
i
had
asked
to
come
here
i
felt
it
to
be
so
uncertain
whether
you
would
come
hope
you
could
seriously
doubt
it
teach
me
to
tell
the
truth
no
i
knew
too
well
your
kindness
i
knew
that
even
to
me
sidney
could
converse
no
longer
he
felt
the
need
of
being
alone
to
put
his
thoughts
in
order
to
resume
his
experiences
during
this
strange
hour
an
extreme
weariness
was
possessing
him
as
though
he
had
been
straining
his
intellect
in
attention
to
some
difficult
subject
and
all
at
once
the
dank
cold
atmosphere
of
the
room
struck
into
his
blood
he
had
a
fit
of
trembling
us
say
for
the
present
clara
gave
her
hand
silently
he
touched
it
for
the
first
time
and
could
not
but
notice
its
delicacy
it
was
very
warm
too
and
moist
without
speaking
she
went
with
him
to
the
outer
door
his
footsteps
sounded
along
the
stone
staircase
clara
listened
until
the
last
echo
was
silent
she
too
had
begun
to
feel
the
chilly
air
hastily
putting
on
her
hat
she
took
up
the
lamp
glanced
round
the
room
to
see
that
nothing
was
left
in
disorder
and
hastened
up
to
the
fifth
storey
in
the
middle
room
through
which
she
had
to
pass
her
father
and
eagles
were
talking
together
the
latter
gave
her
a
respectful
almost
as
to
a
social
superior
within
amy
and
annie
were
just
going
to
bed
she
sat
with
them
in
her
usual
silence
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
having
ascertained
that
eagles
was
gone
into
his
own
chamber
went
out
to
speak
to
her
father
friend
came
she
said
you
suspect
who
it
was
no
i
ca
guess
clara
you
thought
of
mr
kirkwood
do
mean
that
you
are
quite
mistaken
about
jane
snowdon
quite
john
started
up
from
his
seat
he
told
you
so
himself
but
listen
you
are
not
to
say
a
word
on
that
subject
to
him
you
will
be
very
careful
father
john
gazed
at
her
wonderingly
she
kissed
his
forehead
and
withdrew
to
the
other
room
chapter
xxxii
a
haven
john
hewett
no
longer
had
membership
in
club
or
society
the
loss
of
his
made
him
for
the
future
regard
all
such
institutions
with
angry
suspicion
men
ai
satisfied
with
bein
robbed
by
the
upper
classes
they
must
go
and
rob
one
another
he
had
said
to
clerkenwell
green
the
lounging
crowd
no
longer
found
amusement
in
listening
to
his
frenzied
voice
and
in
watching
the
contortions
of
his
rugged
features
he
discussed
the
old
subjects
with
eagles
but
the
latter
computative
mind
was
out
of
sympathy
with
zeal
of
the
tumid
description
though
quite
capable
of
working
himself
into
madness
on
the
details
of
the
budget
john
was
easily
soothed
by
his
friend
calmer
habits
of
debate
kirkwood
influence
moreover
was
again
exerting
itself
upon
him
an
influence
less
than
ever
likely
to
encourage
violence
of
thought
or
speech
in
sidney
company
the
worn
rebel
became
almost
placid
his
rude
fretted
face
fell
into
a
singular
humility
and
mildness
having
ended
by
accepting
what
he
would
formerly
have
called
charity
and
that
from
a
man
whom
he
had
wronged
with
obstinate
perverseness
john
neither
committed
the
error
of
obtruding
his
gratitude
nor
yet
suffered
it
to
be
imagined
that
obligation
sat
upon
him
too
lightly
he
put
no
faith
in
sidney
assertion
that
some
unknown
benefactor
was
to
be
thanked
for
the
new
furniture
one
and
the
same
pocket
had
supplied
that
and
the
money
for
hewett
burial
gratitude
was
all
very
well
but
he
could
not
have
rested
without
taking
some
measures
towards
a
literal
repayment
of
his
debt
the
weekly
coppers
which
had
previously
gone
for
club
subscriptions
were
now
put
away
in
a
they
would
be
long
enough
in
making
an
appreciable
sum
but
yet
if
he
himself
could
never
discharge
the
obligation
his
children
must
take
it
up
after
him
and
this
he
frequently
impressed
upon
amy
annie
and
tom
nothing
however
could
have
detached
john
mind
so
completely
from
its
habits
of
tumult
nor
have
fixed
it
so
firmly
upon
the
interests
of
home
as
his
recovery
of
his
daughter
from
the
day
of
establishment
under
his
roof
he
thought
of
her
and
of
her
only
whilst
working
at
the
he
remained
in
imagination
by
her
side
ceaselessly
repeating
her
words
of
the
night
before
eagerly
looking
for
the
hour
that
would
allow
him
to
return
to
her
joy
and
trouble
mingled
in
an
indescribable
way
to
constitute
his
ordinary
mood
one
moment
he
would
laugh
at
a
thought
and
before
a
companion
could
glance
at
him
his
gladness
would
be
overshadowed
as
if
with
the
heaviest
anxiety
men
who
saw
him
day
after
day
said
at
this
time
that
he
seemed
to
be
growing
childish
he
muttered
to
himself
a
good
deal
and
looked
blankly
at
you
when
you
addressed
him
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
his
state
became
more
settled
but
it
was
not
the
cheerful
impulse
that
predominated
out
of
the
multitude
of
thoughts
concerning
clara
one
had
fixed
itself
as
the
main
controller
of
his
reflection
characteristically
john
hit
upon
what
seemed
an
irremediable
misfortune
and
brooded
over
it
with
all
his
might
if
only
sidney
kirkwood
were
in
the
same
mind
as
four
years
ago
and
now
was
he
to
believe
that
what
he
had
been
told
about
sidney
and
jane
snowdon
was
misleading
was
the
impossible
no
longer
so
he
almost
leapt
from
his
chair
when
he
heard
that
sidney
was
the
visitor
with
whom
his
daughter
had
been
having
her
private
conversation
how
came
they
to
make
this
appointment
there
was
something
in
clara
voice
that
set
his
nerves
that
night
he
could
not
sleep
and
next
morning
he
went
to
work
with
a
senile
quiver
in
his
body
for
the
first
time
for
more
than
two
months
he
turned
into
a
on
his
way
just
to
give
himself
a
little
the
natural
result
of
such
a
tonic
was
to
heighten
the
fever
of
his
imagination
goodness
knows
how
far
he
had
got
in
a
drama
of
happiness
before
he
threw
off
his
coat
and
settled
to
his
day
labour
clara
in
the
meanwhile
suffered
a
corresponding
agitation
more
penetrative
in
proportion
to
the
finer
substance
of
her
nature
she
did
not
know
until
the
scene
was
over
how
much
vital
force
it
had
cost
her
when
she
took
off
the
veil
a
fire
danced
before
her
eyes
and
her
limbs
ached
and
trembled
as
she
lay
down
in
the
darkness
all
night
long
she
was
acting
her
part
over
and
over
when
she
woke
up
it
was
always
at
the
point
where
sidney
replied
to
her
you
are
mistaken
acting
her
part
yes
but
a
few
hours
had
turned
the
into
something
earnest
enough
she
could
not
now
have
met
kirkwood
with
the
of
last
evening
the
fever
that
then
sustained
her
was
much
the
same
as
she
used
to
know
before
she
had
thoroughly
accustomed
herself
to
appearing
in
front
of
an
audience
it
exalted
all
her
faculties
gifted
her
with
a
remarkable
it
was
all
very
well
as
long
as
there
was
need
of
it
but
why
did
it
afflict
her
in
this
torturing
form
now
that
she
desired
to
rest
to
think
of
what
she
had
gained
of
what
hope
she
might
reasonably
nourish
the
purely
selfish
project
which
in
her
desperation
had
seemed
the
only
resource
remaining
to
her
against
a
life
of
intolerable
desolateness
was
taking
hold
upon
her
in
a
way
she
could
not
understand
had
she
not
already
made
a
discovery
that
surpassed
all
expectation
sidney
kirkwood
was
not
bound
to
another
woman
why
could
she
not
accept
that
as
so
much
clear
gain
and
deliberate
as
to
her
next
step
she
had
been
fully
prepared
for
the
opposite
state
of
things
prepared
to
strive
against
any
odds
to
defy
all
probabilities
all
restraints
why
not
thank
her
fortune
and
plot
collectedly
now
that
the
chances
were
so
much
improved
but
from
the
beginning
of
her
interview
with
him
clara
knew
that
something
more
entered
into
her
designs
on
sidney
than
a
cold
she
had
never
loved
him
she
never
loved
anyone
yet
the
inclinations
of
her
early
girlhood
had
been
drawn
by
the
force
of
the
love
he
offered
her
and
to
this
day
she
thought
of
him
with
a
respect
and
liking
such
as
she
had
for
no
other
man
when
she
heard
from
her
father
that
sidney
had
forgotten
her
had
found
some
one
by
whom
his
love
was
prized
her
instant
emotion
was
so
like
a
pang
of
jealousy
that
she
marvelled
at
it
suppose
fate
had
prospered
her
and
she
had
heard
in
the
midst
of
triumphs
that
sidney
kirkwood
the
working
man
in
clerkenwell
was
going
to
marry
a
girl
he
loved
would
any
feeling
of
this
kind
have
come
to
her
her
indifference
would
have
been
complete
it
was
calamity
that
made
her
so
sensitive
longs
for
the
compassion
of
others
that
sidney
who
was
once
her
slave
should
stand
aloof
in
freedom
now
that
she
wanted
sympathy
so
sorely
this
was
a
wound
to
her
heart
that
other
woman
had
robbed
her
of
something
she
could
not
spare
jane
snowdon
too
she
found
it
scarcely
conceivable
that
the
wretched
little
starveling
of
peckover
kitchen
should
have
grown
into
anything
that
a
man
like
sidney
could
love
to
be
sure
there
was
a
mystery
in
her
lot
clara
remembered
perfectly
how
scawthorne
pointed
out
of
the
cab
at
the
old
man
snowdon
and
said
that
he
was
very
rich
a
miser
or
what
more
she
had
never
tried
to
discover
now
sidney
himself
had
hinted
at
something
in
jane
circumstances
which
he
professed
put
it
out
of
the
question
that
he
could
contemplate
marrying
her
had
he
told
her
the
truth
could
she
in
fact
consider
him
free
might
there
not
be
some
reason
for
his
wishing
to
keep
a
secret
with
burning
temples
with
feverish
lips
she
moved
about
her
little
room
like
an
animal
in
a
cage
finding
the
length
of
the
day
intolerable
she
was
constrained
to
inaction
when
it
seemed
to
her
that
every
moment
in
which
she
did
not
do
something
to
keep
sidney
in
mind
of
her
was
worse
than
lost
could
she
not
see
that
girl
jane
snowdon
but
was
not
sidney
denial
as
emphatic
as
it
could
be
she
recalled
his
words
and
tried
numberless
interpretations
would
anything
that
he
had
said
bear
being
interpreted
as
a
sign
that
something
of
the
old
tenderness
still
lived
in
him
and
the
strange
thing
was
that
she
interrogated
herself
on
these
points
not
at
all
like
a
coldly
scheming
woman
who
aims
at
something
that
is
to
be
won
if
at
all
by
the
subtlest
practising
on
another
emotions
whilst
she
remains
unaffected
rather
like
a
woman
who
loves
passionately
whose
ardour
and
jealous
dread
wax
moment
by
moment
for
what
was
she
scheming
for
food
clothing
assured
comfort
during
her
life
hours
ago
clara
would
most
likely
have
believed
that
she
had
indeed
fallen
to
this
but
the
meeting
with
sidney
enlightened
her
least
of
all
women
could
live
by
bread
alone
there
was
the
hunger
of
her
brain
the
hunger
of
her
heart
i
spoke
once
you
remember
of
her
of
tenderness
the
fault
remained
but
her
heart
was
no
longer
so
sterile
of
the
tender
emotions
as
when
revolt
and
ambition
absorbed
all
her
energies
she
had
begun
to
feel
gently
towards
her
father
it
was
an
intimation
of
the
need
which
would
presently
bring
all
the
forces
of
her
nature
into
play
she
dreaded
a
life
of
drudgery
she
dreaded
humiliation
among
her
inferiors
but
that
which
she
feared
most
of
all
was
the
barrenness
of
a
lot
into
which
would
enter
none
of
the
passionate
joys
of
existence
speak
to
clara
of
renunciation
of
saintly
glories
of
the
stony
way
of
perfectness
and
you
addressed
her
in
an
unknown
tongue
nothing
in
her
responded
to
these
ideas
hopelessly
defeated
in
the
one
way
of
aspiration
which
promised
a
large
life
her
being
rebellious
against
the
martyrdom
it
had
suffered
went
forth
eagerly
towards
the
only
happiness
which
was
any
longer
attainable
her
beauty
was
a
dead
thing
never
by
that
means
could
she
command
homage
but
there
is
love
ay
and
passionate
love
which
can
be
independent
of
mere
charm
of
face
in
one
man
only
could
she
hope
to
inspire
it
successful
in
that
she
would
taste
victory
and
even
in
this
fallen
estate
could
make
for
herself
a
dominion
in
these
few
hours
she
so
wrought
upon
her
imagination
as
to
believe
that
the
one
love
of
her
life
had
declared
itself
she
revived
every
memory
she
possibly
could
of
those
years
on
the
far
side
of
the
gulf
and
convinced
herself
that
even
then
she
had
loved
sidney
other
love
of
a
certainty
she
had
not
known
in
standing
face
to
face
with
him
after
so
long
an
interval
she
recognised
the
qualities
which
used
to
impress
her
and
appraised
them
as
formerly
she
could
not
his
features
had
gained
in
attractiveness
the
refinement
which
made
them
an
index
to
his
character
was
more
noticeable
at
the
first
glance
or
perhaps
she
was
better
able
to
distinguish
it
the
slight
bluntness
in
his
manner
reminded
her
of
the
moral
force
which
she
had
known
only
as
something
to
be
resisted
it
was
now
one
of
the
influences
that
drew
her
to
him
had
she
not
always
admitted
that
he
stood
far
above
the
other
men
of
his
class
whom
she
used
to
know
between
his
mind
and
hers
there
was
distinct
kinship
the
sense
that
he
had
both
power
and
right
to
judge
her
explained
in
a
great
measure
her
attitude
of
defiance
towards
him
when
she
was
determined
to
break
away
from
her
humble
conditions
all
along
had
not
one
of
her
main
incentives
to
work
and
strive
been
the
resolve
to
justify
herself
in
view
to
prove
to
that
she
possessed
talent
to
show
herself
to
as
one
whom
the
world
admired
the
repugnance
with
which
she
thought
of
meeting
him
when
she
came
home
with
her
father
meant
in
truth
that
she
dreaded
to
be
assured
that
he
could
only
shrink
from
her
all
her
vital
in
this
wild
current
her
complete
she
experienced
the
humility
of
supreme
egoism
that
state
wherein
self
multiplies
its
claims
to
pity
in
passionate
support
of
its
demand
for
the
object
of
desire
she
felt
capable
of
throwing
herself
at
feet
and
imploring
him
not
to
withdraw
from
her
the
love
of
which
he
had
given
her
so
many
assurances
she
gazed
at
her
scarred
face
until
the
image
was
blurred
with
tears
then
as
though
there
were
luxury
in
weeping
sobbed
for
an
hour
crouching
down
in
a
corner
of
her
room
even
though
his
love
were
as
dead
as
her
beauty
must
he
not
be
struck
to
the
heart
with
compassion
realising
her
woeful
lot
she
asked
nothing
more
eagerly
than
to
humiliate
herself
before
him
to
confess
that
her
pride
was
broken
not
a
charge
he
could
bring
against
her
but
bile
would
admit
its
truth
had
she
been
humble
enough
last
night
when
he
came
again
and
he
must
soon
she
would
throw
aside
every
vestige
of
dignity
lest
he
should
think
that
she
was
strong
enough
to
bear
her
misery
alone
no
matter
how
she
seemed
if
only
she
could
move
his
sympathies
poor
rebel
heart
beat
for
beat
in
these
moments
it
matched
itself
with
that
of
the
purest
woman
who
surrenders
to
a
despairing
love
had
one
charged
her
with
insincerity
how
vehemently
would
her
conscience
have
declared
against
the
outrage
natures
such
as
hers
are
as
little
to
be
judged
by
that
which
is
conventionally
the
highest
standard
as
by
that
which
is
the
lowest
the
tendencies
which
we
agree
to
call
good
and
had
became
in
her
merely
directions
of
a
native
force
which
was
at
all
times
in
revolt
against
circumstance
characters
thus
moulded
may
go
far
in
achievement
but
can
never
pass
beyond
the
bounds
of
suffering
never
is
the
world
their
friend
nor
the
world
law
as
often
as
our
conventions
give
us
the
opportunity
we
crush
them
out
of
being
they
are
noxious
they
threaten
the
frame
of
society
oftenest
the
crushing
is
done
in
such
a
way
that
the
hapless
creatures
seem
to
have
brought
about
their
own
destruction
let
us
congratulate
ourselves
in
one
way
or
other
it
is
assured
that
they
shall
not
trouble
us
long
her
father
was
somewhat
later
than
usual
in
returning
from
work
when
he
entered
her
room
she
looked
at
him
anxiously
and
as
he
seemed
to
have
nothing
particular
to
say
she
asked
if
he
had
seen
kirkwood
my
dear
i
ai
seen
him
their
eyes
met
for
an
instant
clara
was
in
anguish
at
the
thought
that
another
night
and
day
must
pass
and
nothing
be
altered
did
you
see
him
last
a
week
or
more
ago
was
it
that
you
go
round
to
his
lodgings
i
know
he
got
something
he
wants
to
speak
to
you
about
he
assented
but
on
his
going
into
the
other
room
eagles
met
him
with
a
message
from
sidney
anticipating
his
design
and
requesting
him
to
step
over
to
red
lion
street
in
the
course
of
the
evening
john
instantly
announced
this
to
his
daughter
she
nodded
but
said
nothing
in
a
few
minutes
john
went
on
his
way
the
day
work
had
tired
him
exceptionally
doubtless
owing
to
his
nervousness
and
again
on
the
way
to
sidney
he
had
recourse
to
a
dose
of
the
familiar
stimulant
with
our
eyes
on
a
man
of
hewett
station
we
note
these
little
things
we
set
them
down
as
a
point
scored
against
him
yet
if
our
business
were
with
a
man
of
leisure
who
owing
to
worry
found
his
glass
of
wine
at
luncheon
and
again
at
dinner
an
acceptable
support
we
certainly
should
not
think
of
paying
attention
to
the
matter
poverty
makes
a
crime
of
every
indulgence
john
himself
came
out
of
the
in
a
slinking
way
and
hoped
kirkwood
might
not
scent
the
of
gin
sidney
was
in
anything
but
a
mood
to
detect
this
little
lapse
in
his
visitor
he
gave
john
a
chair
but
could
not
sit
still
himself
the
garret
was
a
spacious
one
and
whilst
talking
he
moved
from
wall
to
wall
know
that
i
saw
clara
last
night
she
told
me
she
should
mention
it
to
you
yes
i
was
afraid
she
never
have
made
up
her
mind
to
it
it
was
the
best
way
for
you
to
see
her
alone
first
poor
girl
you
wo
mind
comin
to
us
now
like
you
used
she
tell
you
what
she
wished
to
speak
to
me
about
no
she
has
was
there
anything
particular
feels
the
time
very
heavy
on
her
hands
it
seems
you
do
like
the
thought
of
her
looking
for
employment
john
rose
from
his
chair
and
grasped
the
back
of
it
ai
to
encourage
her
to
leave
us
it
ai
that
you
was
talkin
about
sidney
you
why
where
should
she
go
no
it
all
right
so
long
as
you
was
thinkin
of
her
away
again
see
sidney
i
ai
got
nothing
to
say
against
it
if
she
can
find
some
kind
of
job
for
home
i
know
as
the
time
must
hang
heavy
there
she
sit
poor
thing
from
mornin
to
night
an
ca
get
her
thoughts
away
from
herself
it
easy
enough
to
understand
ai
it
i
took
a
book
home
for
her
the
other
day
but
she
did
seem
to
care
about
it
there
she
sit
with
her
poor
face
on
her
hands
thinkin
and
thinkin
it
breaks
my
heart
to
see
her
i
rather
she
had
some
work
but
she
must
go
away
from
home
for
it
sidney
took
a
few
steps
in
silence
do
misunderstand
me
resumed
the
other
with
suddenness
do
think
as
i
wo
trust
her
away
from
me
if
she
went
it
be
because
she
thinks
herself
a
burden
as
if
i
would
gladly
live
on
a
crust
for
my
day
food
an
spare
her
goin
among
strangers
you
can
think
yourself
what
it
be
to
her
sidney
no
no
it
must
be
nothing
o
that
kind
but
i
ca
ear
to
see
her
livin
as
she
does
it
no
life
at
all
i
sit
with
her
when
i
get
back
home
at
night
i
glad
to
say
she
seems
to
find
it
a
pleasure
to
have
me
by
her
but
it
the
only
bit
o
pleasure
she
gets
an
there
all
the
hours
whilst
i
away
you
see
she
do
take
much
to
eagles
that
her
sort
of
friend
not
as
she
got
any
pride
left
about
her
poor
girl
do
think
that
i
tell
you
sidney
she
a
dear
good
girl
to
her
old
father
if
i
could
only
see
her
a
bit
happier
i
never
grumble
again
as
long
as
i
lived
i
would
is
there
such
a
thing
in
this
world
as
speech
that
has
but
one
simple
interpretation
one
for
him
who
utters
it
and
for
him
who
hears
honester
words
were
never
spoken
than
these
in
which
hewett
strove
to
represent
clara
in
a
favourable
light
and
to
show
the
pitifulness
of
her
situation
yet
he
himself
was
conscious
that
they
implied
a
second
meaning
and
sidney
was
driven
restlessly
about
the
room
by
his
perception
of
the
same
lurking
motive
in
their
pathos
john
felt
of
himself
when
he
ceased
it
was
a
new
thing
for
him
to
be
practising
subtleties
with
a
view
to
his
own
ends
but
had
he
said
a
word
more
than
the
truth
i
suppose
it
was
the
association
of
contrast
that
turned
thoughts
to
joseph
snowdon
at
all
events
it
was
of
him
he
was
thinking
in
the
silence
that
followed
which
silence
having
been
broken
by
a
tap
at
the
door
oddly
enough
there
stood
joseph
himself
hewett
taken
by
surprise
showed
embarrassment
and
awkwardness
it
was
always
hard
for
him
to
reconcile
his
present
subordination
to
snowdon
with
the
familiar
terms
on
which
they
had
been
not
long
ago
you
here
hewett
exclaimed
joseph
in
a
genial
tone
designed
to
put
the
other
at
his
ease
just
wanted
a
word
with
our
friend
never
mind
some
other
time
for
all
that
he
did
not
seem
disposed
to
withdraw
but
stood
with
a
hand
on
the
door
smiling
sidney
having
nodded
to
him
walked
the
length
of
the
room
his
head
bent
and
his
hands
behind
him
i
look
in
u
bit
later
said
hewett
tomorrow
night
sidney
well
night
john
took
his
leave
and
on
the
visitor
who
remained
sidney
turned
a
face
almost
of
anger
snowdon
seated
himself
supremely
indifferent
to
the
inconvenience
he
had
probably
caused
he
seemed
in
excellent
humour
fellow
hewett
he
observed
putting
up
one
leg
against
the
fireplace
decent
fellow
he
getting
old
unfortunately
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
i
understand
it
breaks
a
man
up
sidney
scowled
and
said
nothing
thought
i
stay
as
i
here
continued
joseph
unbuttoning
his
respectable
overcoat
and
throwing
it
open
was
something
rather
particular
i
had
in
mind
wo
you
sit
down
thank
you
joseph
glanced
at
him
and
smiled
all
the
more
had
a
little
talk
with
the
old
man
about
jane
sorry
to
say
he
very
shaky
does
look
himself
at
all
i
know
you
had
spoken
to
him
quite
so
you
know
what
i
mean
it
seems
to
be
his
idea
that
everything
at
an
end
between
you
so
now
look
here
you
wo
mind
me
just
do
you
think
it
was
wise
to
put
it
in
that
way
to
him
i
afraid
you
making
him
feel
just
a
little
uncertain
about
you
i
speaking
as
a
friend
you
know
in
your
own
interest
kirkwood
old
men
get
queer
ideas
into
their
heads
you
know
he
begin
to
think
that
you
had
some
sort
of
eh
it
was
not
the
second
nor
yet
the
third
time
that
joseph
had
looked
in
and
begun
to
speak
in
this
scrappy
way
continuing
the
tone
of
that
dialogue
in
which
he
had
assumed
a
sort
of
community
of
interest
between
kirkwood
and
himself
but
the
limit
of
sidney
endurance
was
reached
no
knowing
he
exclaimed
anyone
may
think
of
me
if
people
who
have
their
own
ends
to
serve
go
spreading
calumnies
let
us
understand
each
other
and
have
done
with
it
i
told
snowdon
that
i
could
never
be
anything
but
a
friend
to
jane
i
said
it
and
i
meant
it
if
you
any
doubt
remaining
in
a
few
days
i
hope
it
be
removed
what
your
real
wishes
maybe
i
do
know
and
i
shall
never
after
this
have
any
need
to
know
i
ca
help
speaking
in
this
way
and
i
want
to
tell
you
once
for
all
that
there
shall
never
again
be
a
word
about
jane
between
us
wait
a
day
or
two
and
you
know
the
reason
joseph
affected
an
air
of
gravity
of
offended
dignity
rather
a
queer
sort
of
way
to
back
out
of
your
engagements
kirkwood
i
wo
say
anything
about
myself
but
with
regard
to
my
daughter
do
you
mean
by
speaking
like
that
cried
the
young
man
sternly
know
very
well
that
it
what
you
wish
most
of
all
to
put
an
end
to
everything
between
your
daughter
and
me
you
succeeded
be
satisfied
if
you
anything
to
say
to
me
on
any
other
subject
say
it
if
not
please
let
have
done
for
the
present
i
do
feel
in
a
mood
for
beating
about
the
bush
any
longer
misunderstood
me
altogether
kirkwood
said
joseph
unable
to
conceal
a
twinkle
of
satisfaction
in
his
eyes
i
understood
you
perfectly
well
too
well
i
do
want
to
hear
another
word
on
the
subject
and
i
wo
it
over
understand
that
well
you
a
bit
out
of
sorts
i
say
for
the
present
he
retired
and
for
a
long
time
sidney
sat
in
black
brooding
john
hewett
did
not
fail
to
present
himself
next
evening
as
he
entered
the
room
he
was
somewhat
surprised
at
the
cheerful
aspect
with
which
sidney
met
him
the
grasp
which
his
hand
received
seemed
to
have
a
significance
sidney
after
looking
at
him
steadily
asked
if
he
had
not
been
home
i
been
home
why
do
you
want
to
know
clara
anything
to
tell
you
what
is
it
she
know
you
were
coming
here
yes
i
mentioned
it
sidney
again
regarded
him
fixedly
with
a
smile
suppose
she
preferred
that
i
should
tell
you
i
looked
in
at
the
buildings
this
afternoon
and
had
a
talk
with
clara
john
hung
upon
his
words
with
lips
slightly
parted
with
a
trembling
in
the
hairs
of
his
grey
beard
did
had
something
to
ask
her
so
i
went
when
she
was
likely
to
be
alone
it
a
long
while
ago
since
i
asked
her
the
question
for
the
first
time
but
i
got
the
right
answer
at
last
john
stared
at
him
in
pathetic
agitation
mean
to
tell
me
you
asked
clara
to
marry
you
nothing
very
dreadful
in
that
i
should
think
us
your
hand
again
sidney
kirkwood
give
us
your
hand
again
if
there
a
man
in
this
world
if
there
a
faithful
honest
man
as
only
lives
to
do
kindness
what
am
i
to
say
to
you
it
too
much
for
me
i
ca
find
a
word
as
i
wish
to
speak
stand
out
and
let
look
at
you
you
make
me
as
i
ca
neither
speak
nor
see
just
like
a
child
he
broke
down
utterly
and
shook
with
the
choking
struggle
of
laughter
and
sobs
his
emotion
affected
sidney
who
looked
pale
and
troubled
in
spite
of
the
smile
still
clinging
feebly
about
his
lips
it
makes
you
glad
to
hear
it
said
the
young
man
in
an
uncertain
voice
all
the
more
glad
myself
on
that
account
me
glad
that
no
word
for
it
boy
that
no
word
for
it
give
us
your
hand
again
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
go
down
on
my
old
knees
and
crave
your
pardon
if
only
she
could
have
lived
to
see
this
the
poor
woman
as
died
when
things
was
at
their
worst
if
i
only
listened
to
her
there
never
have
been
them
years
of
unfriendliness
between
us
you
gone
on
with
one
kindness
after
another
but
this
is
more
than
i
could
ever
a
thought
possible
why
i
took
it
for
certain
as
you
was
goin
to
marry
that
other
young
girl
they
told
me
as
it
was
all
settled
mistake
never
have
dared
to
hope
it
sidney
the
one
thing
as
i
wished
more
than
anything
else
on
earth
and
i
could
think
ever
to
see
it
glad
no
word
for
what
i
feel
and
to
think
as
my
girl
kep
it
from
me
yes
yes
there
was
something
on
her
face
i
remember
it
now
just
goin
round
to
have
a
word
with
sidney
i
says
are
you
father
she
says
do
stay
too
long
and
she
had
a
sort
o
smile
i
could
quite
understand
she
be
a
good
wife
to
you
sidney
her
heart
softened
to
all
as
she
used
to
care
for
she
be
a
good
and
faithful
wife
to
you
as
long
as
she
lives
but
i
must
go
back
home
and
speak
to
her
there
ai
a
man
livin
let
him
be
as
rich
as
he
may
that
feels
such
happiness
as
you
given
me
he
went
stumbling
down
the
stairs
and
walked
homewards
at
a
great
speed
so
that
when
he
reached
the
buildings
he
had
to
wipe
his
face
and
stand
for
a
moment
before
beginning
the
ascent
the
children
were
at
their
home
lessons
he
astonished
them
by
flinging
his
hat
mirthfully
on
to
the
table
then
father
cried
young
tom
the
whose
pen
was
knocked
out
of
his
hand
with
a
chuckle
john
advanced
to
clara
room
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
she
rose
his
face
was
mottled
there
were
about
his
eyes
and
he
had
a
wild
breathless
look
you
never
told
me
you
let
me
go
without
half
a
word
clara
put
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
kissed
him
did
quite
know
whether
it
was
true
or
not
father
darling
my
dear
girl

an
sit
on
my
knee
like
you
used
to
when
you
was
a
little
i
a
rough
old
father
for
such
as
you
but
nobody
never

better
than
i

always
have
done
so
he
been
faithful
to
you
for
all
they
said
there

a
better
man
livin
it
a
long
time
since
i
first
asked
the
question
he
says
but
she
give
me
the
right
answer
at
last
and
he
looks
that
glad
of
it
does
you
sure
he
does
why
you
should
a
seen
him
when
i
went
into
the
room
nothing
more
as
i
wish
for
now
i
only
hope
i
may
live
a
while
longer
to
see
you
forget
all
your
troubles
my
dear
he
make
you
happy
will
sidney
he
got
a
deal
more
education
than
anyone
else
i
ever
knew
and
you
suit
each
other
but
you
wo
forget
all
about
your
old
father
you
let
me
come
an
have
a
talk
with
you
now
and
then
my
dear
just
you
an
me
together
you
know
shall
love
you
and
be
grateful
to
you
always
father
you
kept
a
warm
heart
for
me
all
this
time
could
do
nothing
else
clara
you
always
been
what
i
loved
most
and
you
always
will
be
i
had
had
you
to
come
back
to
what
would
have
become
of
me
never
think
of
that
we
never
speak
another
word
of
that
oh
if
i
had
my
face
again
if
i
had
my
own
face
a
great
anguish
shook
her
she
lay
in
his
arms
and
sobbed
it
was
the
farewell
even
in
her
fulness
of
heart
and
deep
sense
of
consolation
to
all
she
had
most
vehemently
desired
gratitude
and
being
indivisible
in
her
emotions
she
knew
not
herself
whether
the
ache
of
regret
or
the
soothing
restfulness
of
deliverance
made
her
tears
flow
but
at
least
there
was
no
conscious
duplicity
and
for
the
moment
no
doubt
that
she
had
found
her
haven
it
is
a
virtuous
world
and
our
frequent
condemnations
are
invariably
based
on
justice
will
it
be
greatly
harmful
if
for
once
we
temper
our
righteous
judgment
with
ever
so
little
mercy
chapter
xxxiii
a
fall
from
the
ideal
joseph
snowdon
waxed
daily
in
respectability
he
was
for
one
thing
clothing
himself
in
flesh
and
though
still
anything
but
a
portly
man
bore
himself
as
becomes
one
who
can
indulge
a
taste
for
eating
and
drinking
his
step
was
more
deliberate
he
no
longer
presented
the
suppleness
of
limb
that
so
often
accompanies
a
needy
condition
in
the
man
of
wits
he
grew
attentive
to
his
personal
equipment
he
was
always
well
combed
and
well
shaven
and
generally
in
hours
of
leisure
you
perceived
a
fragrance
breathing
from
his
handkerchief
nor
was
this
refinement
addressed
only
to
the
public
to
clem
he
behaved
with
a
correctness
which
kept
that
lady
in
a
state
of
acute
suspicion
not
seldom
he
brought
her
a
trifling
gift
which
he
would
offer
with
compliments
and
he
made
a
point
of
consulting
her
pleasure
or
convenience
in
all
matters
that
affected
them
in
common
a
similar
dignity
of
bearing
marked
his
relations
with
hanover
street
when
he
entered
jane
parlour
it
was
with
a
beautiful
blending
of
familiarity
and
courtesy
he
took
his
daughter
hand
with
an
air
of
graceful
affection
retaining
it
for
a
moment
between
his
own
and
regarding
her
with
a
gentle
smile
which
hinted
the
pride
of
a
parent
in
speaking
with
the
old
man
he
habitually
subdued
his
voice
respectfully
bending
forward
solicitously
watching
the
opportunity
of
a
service
michael
had
pleasure
in
his
company
and
conversation
without
overdoing
it
joseph
accustomed
himself
to
speak
of
philanthropic
interests
he
propounded
a
scheme
for
supplying
the
poor
with
a
certain
excellent
filter
at
a
price
all
but
nominal
who
did
not
know
the
benefit
to
humble
homes
of
pure
water
for
use
as
a
beverage
the
filter
was
not
made
yet
but
lake
snowdon
had
it
under
their
consideration
michael
kept
his
room
a
good
deal
in
these
wretched
days
of
winter
so
that
joseph
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
private
interviews
with
his
daughter
every
such
occasion
he
used
assiduously
his
great
end
being
to
possess
himself
of
jane
confidence
he
did
not
succeed
quite
so
well
with
the
girl
as
with
her
grandfather
there
was
always
a
reserve
in
her
behaviour
which
as
yet
he
found
it
impossible
to
overcome
observation
led
him
to
conclude
that
much
of
this
arose
from
the
view
she
took
of
his
relations
with
sidney
kirkwood
jane
was
in
love
with
sidney
on
that
point
he
could
have
no
doubt
and
in
all
likelihood
she
regarded
him
as
unfriendly
to
sidney
suit
women
are
so
shrewd
in
these
affairs
accordingly
joseph
made
it
his
business
by
artful
degrees
to
remove
this
prepossession
from
her
mind
in
the
course
of
this
endeavour
he
naturally
pressed
into
his
service
the
gradually
discovered
fact
that
sidney
had
scruples
of
conscience
regarding
fortune
marvellous
as
it
appeared
to
him
he
had
all
but
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
a
fact
now
given
jane
character
which
he
believed
he
had
sounded
given
her
love
for
kirkwood
which
was
obviously
causing
her
anxiety
and
unhappiness
joseph
saw
his
way
to
an
admirable
piece
of
strategy
what
could
be
easier
if
he
played
his
cards
well
and
patiently
enough
than
to
lead
jane
to
regard
the
fortune
as
her
most
threatening
enemy
valuable
results
might
come
of
that
whether
before
or
after
the
death
of
the
old
man
the
conversation
in
which
he
first
ventured
to
strike
this
note
undisguisedly
took
place
on
the
same
evening
as
that
unpleasant
scene
when
sidney
as
good
as
quarrelled
with
him
the
evening
before
the
day
on
which
sidney
asked
clara
hewett
to
be
his
wife
having
found
jane
alone
he
began
to
talk
in
his
most
paternal
manner
his
chair
very
near
hers
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
sewing
and
presently
when
the
ground
was
prepared
there
something
i
been
wanting
to
say
to
you
for
a
long
time
my
dear
i
uneasy
about
you
father
and
she
glanced
at
him
nervously
i
uneasy
but
whether
i
ought
to
tell
you
why
i
sure
i
know
you
my
own
child
janey
and
you
become
dearer
to
me
every
day
but
it
hard
to
say
it
there
naturally
is
all
the
confidence
between
us
that
there
might
have
been
if
well
well
i
wo
speak
of
that
wo
you
tell
me
what
makes
you
anxious
he
laid
the
tips
of
his
fingers
on
her
head
shall
you
be
offended
if
i
speak
about
mr
kirkwood
father
she
tried
in
vain
to
continue
sewing
dear
i
believe
there
no
actual
engagement
between
you
no
father
she
replied
faintly
yet
do
be
angry
with
me
my
child
i
think
you
are
something
more
than
friends
she
made
no
answer
i
ca
help
thinking
janey
i
think
about
you
very
often
indeed
that
kirkwood
has
rather
exaggerated
views
about
the
necessity
of
of
altering
things
between
you
quite
recently
joseph
had
become
aware
of
the
understanding
between
michael
and
kirkwood
the
old
man
still
hesitated
to
break
the
news
to
jane
saying
to
himself
that
it
was
better
for
sidney
to
prepare
her
by
the
change
in
his
behaviour
altering
things
jane
repeated
under
her
breath
seems
to
me
wrong
wrong
to
both
of
you
joseph
pursued
in
a
pathetic
voice
ca
help
noticing
my
child
looks
i
know
she
is
what
she
used
to
be
poor
little
girl
and
i
know
kirkwood
what
he
used
to
be
it
very
hard
and
i
feel
for
you
for
both
of
you
jane
sat
motionless
not
daring
to
lift
her
eyes
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
father
wonder
whether
i
doing
wrong
to
your
grandfather
in
speaking
to
you
confidentially
like
this
i
ca
believe
he
notices
things
as
i
do
he
never
wish
you
to
be
unhappy
i
do
quite
understand
father
what
do
you
mean
about
kirkwood
why
should
he
the
impulse
failed
her
a
fear
which
she
had
harboured
for
many
weary
days
was
being
confirmed
and
she
could
not
ask
directly
for
the
word
that
would
kill
hope
i
a
right
to
tell
you
i
thought
perhaps
you
understood
you
have
gone
so
far
i
think
you
must
explain
i
do
see
how
you
can
be
doing
wrong
kirkwood
you
see
he
in
such
a
delicate
position
my
dear
i
think
myself
that
he
acting
rather
strangely
after
everything
but
it
it
your
money
jane
he
does
think
he
ought
to
ask
you
to
marry
him
under
the
circumstances
she
trembled
who
should
stand
by
you
in
a
case
like
this
if
not
your
own
father
of
course
he
ca
say
a
word
to
you
himself
and
of
course
you
ca
say
a
word
to
him
and
altogether
it
a
pitiful
business
jane
shrank
from
discussing
such
a
topic
with
her
father
her
next
words
were
uttered
with
difficulty
the
money
is
my
own
it
never
be
my
own
he
kirkwood
knows
that
does
to
be
sure
but
it
makes
no
difference
he
has
told
your
grandfather
my
love
that
that
the
responsibility
would
be
too
great
he
has
told
him
distinctly
that
everything
at
an
end
everything
that
have
happened
she
just
looked
at
him
then
dropped
her
eyes
on
her
sewing
as
your
father
janey
i
know
it
right
that
you
should
be
told
of
this
i
feel
you
being
very
cruelly
treated
my
child
and
i
wish
to
goodness
i
could
only
see
any
way
out
of
it
for
you
both
of
course
i
powerless
either
for
acting
or
speaking
you
can
understand
that
but
i
want
you
to
think
of
me
as
your
truest
friend
my
love
more
still
he
said
but
jane
had
no
ears
for
it
when
he
left
her
she
bade
him
mechanically
and
stood
on
the
same
spot
by
the
door
without
thought
stunned
by
what
she
had
learnt
that
sidney
would
be
impelled
to
such
a
decision
as
this
she
had
never
imagined
his
reserve
whilst
yet
she
was
in
ignorance
of
her
true
position
she
could
understand
also
his
delaying
for
a
while
even
after
everything
had
been
explained
to
her
but
that
he
should
draw
away
from
her
altogether
seemed
inexplicable
for
it
implied
a
change
in
him
which
nothing
had
prepared
her
to
think
possible
unaltered
in
his
love
he
refused
to
share
the
task
of
her
life
to
aid
in
the
work
which
he
regarded
with
such
fervent
sympathy
her
mind
was
not
subtle
enough
to
conceive
those
objections
to
michael
idea
which
had
weighed
with
sidney
almost
from
the
first
for
though
she
had
herself
shrunk
from
the
great
undertaking
it
was
merely
in
weakness
a
reason
she
never
dreamt
of
attributing
to
him
nor
had
she
caught
as
much
as
a
glimpse
of
those
base
scheming
interests
contact
with
which
had
aroused
sidney
vehement
disgust
was
her
father
to
be
trusted
this
was
the
first
question
that
shaped
itself
in
her
mind
he
did
not
like
sidney
that
she
had
felt
all
along
as
well
as
the
reciprocal
coldness
on
sidney
part
but
did
his
unfriendliness
go
so
far
as
to
prompt
him
to
intervene
with
untruths
course
you
ca
say
a
word
to
him
that
remark
would
bear
an
evil
interpretation
which
her
tormented
mind
did
not
fail
to
suggest
moreover
he
had
seemed
so
anxious
that
she
should
not
broach
the
subject
with
her
grandfather
but
what
constrained
her
to
silence
if
indeed
he
had
nothing
but
her
happiness
at
heart
he
could
not
take
it
ill
that
she
should
seek
to
understand
the
whole
truth
and
michael
must
tell
her
whether
sidney
had
indeed
thus
spoken
to
him
before
she
had
obtained
any
show
of
control
over
her
agitation
michael
came
into
the
room
evening
was
the
old
man
best
time
and
when
he
had
kept
his
own
chamber
through
the
day
he
liked
to
come
and
sit
with
jane
as
she
had
her
supper
i
hear
your
father
voice
he
asked
as
he
moved
slowly
to
his
accustomed
chair
he
could
stay
jane
stood
in
an
attitude
of
indecision
having
seated
himself
michael
glanced
at
her
his
regard
had
not
its
old
directness
it
seemed
apprehensive
as
if
seeking
to
probe
her
thought
miss
lant
sent
you
the
book
she
promised
grandfather
this
was
a
recently
published
volume
dealing
with
charitable
enterprise
in
some
part
of
london
michael
noticed
with
surprise
the
uninterested
tone
of
jane
reply
again
he
looked
at
her
and
more
searchingly
you
like
to
read
me
a
little
of
it
she
reached
the
book
from
a
drew
near
and
stood
turning
the
pages
the
confusion
of
her
mind
was
such
that
she
could
not
have
read
a
word
with
understanding
then
she
spoke
involuntarily
has
kirkwood
said
anything
more
about
me
the
words
made
painful
discord
in
her
ears
but
instead
of
showing
heightened
colour
she
grew
pallid
holding
the
book
partly
open
she
felt
all
her
nerves
and
muscles
strained
as
if
in
some
physical
effort
her
feet
were
rooted
to
the
spot
you
heard
anything
from
him
returned
the
old
man
resting
his
hands
on
the
sides
of
the
has
been
speaking
about
him
he
says
kirkwood
has
told
you
something
come
and
sit
down
by
me
jane
she
could
not
move
nearer
though
unable
to
form
a
distinct
conception
she
felt
a
foreboding
of
what
must
come
to
pass
the
dread
failure
of
strength
was
more
than
threatening
her
her
heart
was
sinking
and
by
no
effort
of
will
could
she
summon
the
thoughts
that
should
aid
her
against
herself
has
your
father
told
you
michael
asked
when
he
perceived
her
distress
he
spoke
with
a
revival
of
energy
clearly
commandingly
says
that
kirkwood
wishes
you
to
forget
what
he
told
you
and
what
you
repeated
to
me
he
give
you
any
reason
i
do
understand
though
here
by
me
jane
let
talk
about
it
quietly
sidney
feel
able
to
help
you
as
he
thought
he
could
we
must
blame
him
for
that
he
must
judge
for
himself
he
thinks
it
be
better
if
you
continue
to
be
only
friends
jane
averted
her
face
his
steady
look
being
more
than
she
could
bear
for
an
instant
a
sense
of
uttermost
shame
thrilled
through
her
and
without
knowing
what
she
did
she
moved
a
little
and
laid
the
book
down
here
my
child
he
repeated
in
a
gentler
voice
she
approached
him
feel
it
hard
but
when
you
thought
about
it
a
little
you
grieve
i
sure
you
wo
remember
your
life
is
not
to
be
like
that
of
ordinary
women
you
higher
objects
before
you
and
you
find
a
higher
reward
you
know
that
do
you
there
no
need
for
me
to
remind
you
of
what
we
talked
about
so
often
is
there
if
it
a
sacrifice
you
strong
enough
to
face
it
yes
yes
strong
enough
to
face
more
than
this
my
jane
is
only
fix
your
thoughts
on
the
work
you
going
to
do
it
take
up
all
your
life
jane
wo
it
have
no
time
to
give
to
such
things
as
occupy
other
women
no
mind
for
them
his
grey
eyes
searched
her
countenance
with
that
horrible
intensity
of
fanaticism
which
is
so
like
the
look
of
cruelty
of
greed
of
any
passion
originating
in
the
baser
self
unlike
too
of
course
but
it
is
the
pitilessness
common
to
both
extremes
that
shows
most
strongly
in
an
old
wrinkled
visage
he
had
laid
his
hand
upon
her
every
word
was
a
stab
in
the
girl
heart
and
so
dreadful
became
her
torture
so
intolerable
the
sense
of
being
drawn
by
a
fierce
will
away
from
all
she
desired
that
at
length
a
cry
escaped
her
lips
she
fell
on
her
knees
by
him
and
pleaded
in
a
choking
voice
ca
grandfather
do
ask
it
of
me
give
it
all
to
some
one
else
to
some
one
else
i
not
strong
enough
to
make
such
a
sacrifice
let
me
be
as
i
was
before
michael
face
darkened
he
drew
his
hand
away
and
rose
from
the
seat
with
more
than
surprise
with
anger
and
even
bitterness
he
looked
down
at
the
crouching
girl
she
did
not
sob
her
face
buried
in
her
arms
she
lay
against
the
chair
quivering
silent
stand
up
and
speak
to
me
she
did
not
move
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
jane
raised
her
head
and
endeavoured
to
obey
him
in
the
act
she
moaned
and
fell
insensible
michael
strode
to
the
door
and
called
twice
or
thrice
for
byass
then
he
stooped
by
the
lifeless
girl
and
supported
her
head
bessie
was
immediately
at
hand
with
a
cry
of
consternation
but
also
with
helpful
activity
i
thought
she
got
over
this
it
a
long
time
since
she
was
took
last
is
it
sam
downstairs
snowdon
do
just
shout
out
to
him
to
go
for
some
brandy
tell
him
to
bring
my
first
if
he
knows
where
it
is
i
blest
if
i
do
poor
thing
she
ai
been
at
all
well
lately
and
that
the
truth
the
truth
beyond
a
doubt
pale
face
showing
now
the
thinness
which
it
had
not
wholly
outgrown
the
inheritance
from
miserable
childhood
no
face
of
a
stern
heroine
counting
as
idle
all
the
natural
longings
of
the
heart
consecrated
to
a
lifelong
combat
with
giant
wrongs
nothing
better
nor
worse
than
the
face
of
one
who
can
love
and
must
be
loved
in
turn
she
came
to
herself
and
at
the
same
moment
michael
went
from
the
room
now
there
now
crooned
bessie
with
much
patting
of
the
hands
and
stroking
of
the
checks
what
come
to
you
jane
cry
away
do
try
to
prevent
yourself
it
do
you
good
to
cry
a
bit
of
course
here
comes
sam
with
all
sorts
of
things
when
there
no
need
of
him
he
always
either
too
soon
or
too
late
is
sam
just
look
at
him
jane
now
if
do
make
you
laugh
nothing
will
byass
retired
shamefaced
leaning
against
bessie
shoulder
jane
sobbed
for
a
long
time
sobbed
in
the
misery
of
shame
she
saw
that
her
grandfather
had
gone
away
how
should
she
ever
face
him
after
this
it
was
precious
comfort
to
feel
bessie
sturdy
arms
about
her
and
to
hear
the
foolish
affectionate
words
which
asked
nothing
but
that
she
should
take
them
kindly
and
have
done
with
her
trouble
grandfather
tell
you
how
it
was
she
asked
with
a
sudden
fear
lest
bessie
should
have
learnt
her
pitiful
weakness
no
how
did
it
come
do
know
we
were
talking
i
can
stand
up
now
byass
thank
you
i
go
up
to
my
room
i
forgotten
the
time
is
it
late
it
was
only
nine
bessie
would
have
gone
upstairs
with
her
but
jane
insisted
that
she
was
quite
herself
on
the
stairs
she
trod
as
lightly
as
possible
and
she
closed
her
door
without
a
sound
alone
she
again
gave
way
to
tears
michael
face
was
angry
in
her
memory
he
had
never
looked
at
her
in
that
way
before
and
now
he
would
never
look
with
the
old
kindness
what
a
change
had
been
wrought
in
these
few
minutes
and
sidney
never
anything
but
her
friend
cold
meaningless
word
if
he
knew
how
she
had
fallen
would
that
be
likely
to
bring
him
nearer
to
her
she
had
lost
both
things
that
was
all
chapter
xxxiv
the
debt
repaid
she
rose
early
in
the
murky
cola
of
the
winter
morning
when
at
eight
she
knocked
as
usual
at
her
grandfather
door
his
answer
made
her
tremble
shall
be
down
in
a
few
minutes
jane
i
have
breakfast
with
you
it
was
long
since
he
had
risen
at
this
hour
his
voice
sounded
less
like
that
of
an
old
man
and
in
spite
of
his
calling
her
by
her
name
she
felt
the
tone
to
be
severe
when
he
reached
the
parlour
he
did
not
offer
to
take
her
hand
and
she
feared
to
approach
him
she
saw
that
his
features
bore
the
mark
of
sleeplessness
hers
poor
girl
were
yet
more
woeful
in
their
pallor
through
the
meal
he
affected
to
occupy
himself
with
the
book
miss
lant
had
sent
the
sight
of
which
was
intolerable
to
jane
and
not
for
a
full
hour
did
he
speak
anything
but
casual
words
jane
had
taken
her
sewing
unexpectedly
he
addressed
her
have
a
word
or
two
together
jane
i
think
we
ought
to
we
she
forced
herself
to
regard
him
think
you
meant
what
you
said
last
night
i
will
do
whatever
you
bid
me
i
do
it
faithfully
i
was
ungrateful
i
feel
ashamed
to
have
spoken
so
nothing
to
do
with
it
jane
you
not
ungrateful
anything
but
that
but
i
had
a
night
to
think
over
your
words
you
speak
like
that
if
you
were
driven
to
it
by
the
strongest
feeling
you
ever
knew
or
will
know
i
had
thought
of
it
in
that
way
i
had
thought
of
you
in
that
way
he
began
gently
but
in
the
last
words
was
a
touch
of
reproof
almost
of
scorn
he
gazed
at
her
from
under
his
grey
eyebrows
perhaps
hoping
to
elicit
some
resistance
of
her
spirit
some
sign
of
strength
that
would
help
him
to
reconstruct
his
shattered
ideal
i
try
with
all
my
strength
to
be
what
you
wish
i
will
suppose
the
strength
is
sufficient
child
even
in
her
humility
she
could
not
but
feel
that
this
was
unjust
had
she
ever
boasted
had
she
ever
done
more
than
promise
tremblingly
what
he
demanded
but
the
fear
was
legitimate
a
weak
thing
all
but
could
she
hope
to
tread
firmly
in
any
difficult
path
she
hung
her
head
making
no
answer
he
examined
her
seeming
to
measure
the
slightness
of
her
frame
sad
unutterably
sad
was
the
deep
breath
he
drew
as
he
turned
his
eyes
away
again
you
feel
well
this
morning
jane
grandfather
you
slept
could
you
were
grieving
about
me
i
hoped
never
to
have
disappointed
you
he
fell
into
reverie
was
he
thinking
of
that
poor
wife
of
his
dead
long
long
ago
the
girl
of
whom
he
had
expected
impossible
things
a
second
time
had
he
thus
erred
no
longer
with
the
excuse
of
inexperience
and
hot
blood
that
cry
of
jane
had
made
its
way
to
his
heart
an
enthusiast
he
was
yet
capable
of
seeing
by
the
common
light
of
day
when
his
affections
were
deeply
stirred
and
in
the
night
he
had
pondered
much
over
his
son
behaviour
was
he
being
deceived
in
that
quarter
also
and
there
intentionally
did
joseph
know
this
child
better
than
he
had
done
and
calculate
upon
her
weakness
the
shock
instead
of
disabling
him
had
caused
a
revival
of
his
strength
he
could
walk
more
firmly
this
morning
than
at
any
time
since
his
accident
his
brain
was
clear
and
active
he
knew
that
it
behoved
him
to
reconsider
all
he
had
been
doing
and
that
quickly
ere
it
was
too
late
he
must
even
forget
that
aching
of
the
heart
until
he
had
leisure
to
indulge
it
sha
disappoint
me
my
dear
he
said
gravely
my
own
fault
if
i
do
take
your
kindness
as
you
mean
it
i
have
to
go
out
jane
but
i
shall
be
back
to
dinner
perhaps
we
talk
again
afterwards
of
late
on
the
rare
occasions
of
his
leaving
the
house
he
had
always
told
her
where
he
was
going
and
for
what
purpose
jane
understood
that
this
confidence
was
at
an
end
when
he
was
gone
she
found
occupation
for
a
short
time
but
presently
could
only
sit
over
the
fire
nursing
her
many
griefs
she
was
no
longer
deemed
worthy
of
confidence
worse
than
that
she
had
no
more
faith
in
herself
if
sidney
learnt
what
had
happened
he
could
not
even
retain
his
respect
for
her
in
this
way
she
thought
of
it
judging
kirkwood
by
the
ideal
standard
which
fortunately
is
so
unlike
human
nature
taking
it
for
granted
so
oppressed
was
her
mind
by
the
habit
of
dwelling
on
artificial
motives
that
he
only
liked
her
because
he
had
believed
her
strong
in
purpose
forgetting
altogether
that
his
love
had
grown
before
he
was
aware
that
anything
unusual
was
required
of
her
she
did
remember
indeed
that
it
was
only
the
depth
of
her
love
for
him
which
had
caused
her
disgrace
but
even
if
he
came
to
understand
that
it
would
not
she
feared
weigh
in
her
favour
against
his
judgment
it
was
the
natural
result
of
the
influences
to
which
she
had
been
subjected
her
mind
overwrought
by
resolute
contemplation
of
ideas
beyond
its
scope
her
gentle
nature
bent
beneath
a
burden
of
duty
to
which
it
was
unequal
and
taught
to
consider
with
painful
solemnity
those
impulses
of
kindness
which
would
otherwise
have
been
merely
the
simple
joys
of
life
she
had
come
to
distrust
every
instinct
which
did
not
subserve
the
supreme
purpose
even
of
sidney
conduct
she
could
not
reason
in
a
natural
way
instinct
would
have
bidden
her
reproach
him
though
ever
so
gently
was
it
well
done
to
draw
away
when
he
must
have
known
how
she
looked
for
his
aid
her
artificial
self
urged
on
the
other
hand
that
he
had
not
acted
thus
without
some
gravely
considered
motive
what
it
was
she
could
not
pretend
to
divine
her
faith
in
his
nobleness
overcame
every
perplexity
of
the
persons
constituting
this
little
group
and
playing
their
several
parts
she
alone
had
fallen
altogether
below
what
was
expected
of
her
as
humble
now
as
in
the
days
of
her
serfdom
jane
was
incapable
of
revolting
against
the
tyranny
of
circumstances
life
had
grown
very
hard
for
her
again
but
she
believed
that
this
was
to
a
great
extent
her
own
fault
the
outcome
of
her
own
unworthy
weakness
at
michael
return
she
did
her
best
to
betray
no
idle
despondency
their
midday
meal
was
almost
as
silent
as
breakfast
had
been
his
eyes
avoided
her
and
frequently
he
lost
himself
in
thought
as
he
was
rising
from
the
table
jane
observed
an
unsteadiness
in
his
movement
he
shook
his
head
mechanically
and
leaned
forward
on
both
his
hands
as
if
feeling
giddy
she
approached
him
but
did
not
venture
to
speak
go
upstairs
he
said
having
sighed
slightly
i
come
and
read
to
you
grandfather
just
now
jane
go
out
whilst
it
a
bit
fine
he
went
from
the
room
still
with
an
unsteady
walk
reaching
his
own
room
where
there
was
a
cheerful
fire
he
sat
down
and
remained
for
a
long
time
unoccupied
save
with
his
reflections
this
chamber
had
scarcely
changed
in
a
detail
of
its
arrangement
since
he
first
came
to
inhabit
it
there
was
the
chair
which
sidney
always
used
and
that
on
which
jane
had
sat
since
she
was
the
silent
frail
child
of
thirteen
here
had
his
vision
taken
form
growing
more
definite
with
the
growth
of
his
granddaughter
seeming
to
become
at
length
a
splendid
reality
what
talk
had
been
held
here
between
kirkwood
and
himself
whilst
jane
listened
all
gone
into
silence
gone
too
the
hope
it
had
encouraged
he
was
weary
after
the
morning
absence
from
home
and
fell
into
a
light
slumber
dreams
troubled
him
first
he
found
himself
in
australia
he
heard
again
the
sudden
news
of
his
son
death
the
shock
awoke
him
another
dozing
fit
and
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
wife
and
children
to
support
haunted
with
the
fear
of
coming
to
want
harsh
unreasonable
in
his
exactions
at
home
something
like
a
large
black
coffin
came
into
his
dream
and
in
dread
of
it
he
again
returned
to
consciousness
all
night
he
had
been
thinking
of
the
dark
story
of
long
ago
his
wife
form
motionless
on
the
bed
the
bottle
which
told
him
what
had
happened
why
must
that
memory
revive
to
trouble
his
last
days
part
of
his
zeal
for
the
great
project
had
come
of
a
feeling
that
he
might
thus
in
some
degree
repair
his
former
jane
would
be
a
providence
to
many
hapless
women
whose
burden
was
as
heavy
as
his
own
wife
had
been
must
he
abandon
that
solace
in
any
case
he
could
bestow
his
money
for
charitable
purposes
but
it
would
not
be
the
same
it
would
not
effect
what
he
had
aimed
at
late
in
the
afternoon
he
drew
from
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
a
long
envelope
and
took
thence
a
folded
paper
it
was
covered
with
clerkly
writing
which
he
perused
several
times
at
length
he
tore
the
paper
slowly
across
the
middle
again
tore
the
fragments
and
threw
them
on
to
the
fire
jane
obeyed
her
grandfather
word
and
went
out
for
an
hour
she
wished
for
news
of
pennyloaf
who
had
been
ill
and
was
now
very
near
the
time
of
her
confinement
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
merlin
place
she
was
surprised
to
encounter
bob
hewett
who
stood
in
a
lounging
attitude
he
had
never
appeared
to
her
so
disreputable
not
that
his
clothes
were
worse
than
usual
but
his
face
and
hands
were
dirty
and
the
former
was
set
in
a
look
your
wife
upstairs
mr
hewett
jane
asked
when
he
had
nodded
sullenly
in
reply
to
her
greeting
and
somebody
else
too
as
could
have
been
dispensed
with
another
mouth
to
feed
there
ai
cried
a
woman
voice
just
behind
him
jane
recognised
the
speaker
a
griffin
who
lived
in
the
house
and
was
neighbourly
to
pennyloaf
ai
inquired
bob
gruffly
child
dead
goodness
for
that
any
way
griffin
explained
to
jane
that
the
birth
had
taken
place
twelve
hours
ago
pennyloaf
was
low
but
not
in
a
state
to
cause
anxiety
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
jane
to
wait
until
before
seeing
her
did
say
thank
goodness
added
the
woman
with
a
scornful
glance
at
bob
i
do
think
she
over
sorry
as
it
gone
small
blame
to
her
there
some
people
as
does
care
much
what
sort
o
times
she
has
not
meanin
miss
but
them
as
had
to
care
bob
looked
more
disreputable
than
ever
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
jane
and
with
such
a
singular
expression
that
the
latter
meeting
their
gaze
felt
startled
she
did
not
know
why
at
the
same
moment
he
stepped
down
from
the
threshold
and
walked
away
without
speaking
should
care
to
have
for
a
pursued
griffin
course
he
must
go
an
lose
his
work
just
when
his
wife
wantin
a
few
little
extries
as
you
may
say
his
work
i
do
like
him
an
i
do
like
his
ways
be
gettin
into
trouble
before
long
you
mind
what
i
say
his
a
queer
lot
to
what
they
tell
do
you
know
them
miss
used
to
a
long
time
ago
knew
his
sister

as
is
come

was
a
actress
bannister

tellin
me

last
night

from
a
friend
of
hers
as

in
the
buildin
where
the
hewetts
lives
too
they
tell
me
it
was
in
the
sunday
paper
though
i
do
remember
nothing
about
it
at
the
time
it
seems
as
how
a
woman
threw
vitrol
over
her
an
burnt
her
face
so
as
there
no
knowin

an

goes
about
with
a
veil
she
ca
get
her
own
livin
no
more
of
course
she
come
back
for
all
she
ran
away
an
disgraced
herself
shameful
jane
gazed
fixedly
at
the
speaker
scarcely
able
to
gather
the
sense
of
what
was
said
hewett
you
mean
hewett
eldest
daughter
i
understand
has
come
home
when
ca
just
say
but
a
few
weeks
ago
i
believe
they
say
it
nearly
two
months
since
it
was
in
the
paper
hewett
know
about
it
ca
say
she
never
spoke
to
me
as
if
she
did
and
as
i
tell
you
i
only
heard
myself
if
you
a
friend
of
theirs
i
had
ought
to
a
mentioned
it
it
just
come
to
my
lips
in
the
way
o
tallin
of
course
i
do
know
nothin
about
the
young
woman
myself
it
only
what
you
comes
to
in
the
way
o
talkin
you
know
this
apology
was
doubtless
produced
by
the
listener
troubled
countenance
jane
asked
no
further
question
but
said
she
would
come
to
see
pennyloaf
on
the
morrow
and
so
took
her
leave
at
ten
next
morning
just
when
jane
was
preparing
for
her
visit
to
merlin
place
so
possessed
with
anxiety
to
ascertain
if
pennyloaf
knew
anything
about
clara
hewett
that
all
her
troubles
were
for
the
moment
in
the
back
ground
bessie
byass
came
running
upstairs
with
a
strange
announcement
sidney
kirkwood
had
called
and
wished
to
see
miss
snowdon
in
private
for
a
few
minutes
must
have
happened
said
jane
her
heart
standing
still
bessie
had
a
significant
smile
but
suppressed
it
when
she
noticed
the
agitation
into
which
her
friend
was
fallen
i
ask
him
up
into
the
front
room
michael
was
in
his
own
chamber
which
he
had
not
left
this
morning
on
going
to
the
parlour
jane
found
her
visitor
standing
in
expectancy
yes
something
had
happened
it
needed
but
to
look
at
him
to
be
convinced
of
that
and
before
a
word
was
spoken
jane
knew
that
his
coming
had
reference
to
clara
hewett
knew
it
with
the
strangest
certainty
did
go
to
work
this
morning
sidney
began
i
was
very
anxious
to
see
you
alone
i
have
something
to
speak
about
to
tell
you
us
sit
down
sidney
waited
till
he
met
her
look
she
regarded
him
without
without
any
effort
to
conceal
her
agitated
interest
see
young
hewett
and
his
wife
sometimes
have
you
heard
from
either
of
them
that
clara
hewett
is
living
with
her
father
again
from
them
a
person
in
their
house
spoke
about
it
yesterday
it
was
the
first
i
had
heard
of
miss
hewett
in
a
gossiping
way
do
you
mean
you
know
what
has
happened
to
her
the
woman
told
the
truth
there
was
silence
snowdon
i
do
like
you
to
speak
so
you
used
to
call
me
jane
he
looked
at
her
in
distress
she
had
spoken
impulsively
but
not
with
the
kind
of
emotion
the
words
seem
to
imply
it
was
for
his
sake
not
for
hers
that
she
broke
that
formal
speech
called
me
so
when
i
was
a
child
kirkwood
she
continued
smiling
for
all
she
was
so
pale
sounds
as
if
something
had
altered
you
my
oldest
friend
and
wo
you
always
be
so
whatever
you
going
to
tell
me
surely
it
does
prevent
us
from
being
friends
just
the
same
as
always
he
had
not
seen
her
in
her
weakness
the
night
before
last
as
little
as
he
could
imagine
that
was
he
able
to
estimate
the
strength
with
which
she
now
redeemed
her
womanly
dignity
his
face
told
her
what
he
had
to
disclose
no
question
now
of
proving
herself
superior
to
common
feelings
it
was
sidney
who
made
appeal
to
her
and
her
heart
went
forth
to
grant
him
all
he
desired
dear
good
jane
you
remember
what
i
said
to
you
in
the
garden
at
danbury
that
i
had
forgotten
her
i
thought
it
was
true
but
you
know
what
a
terrible
thing
has
befallen
her
i
should
be
less
than
a
man
if
i
could
say
that
she
is
nothing
to
me
you
spoken
to
her
have
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
jane
if
i
had
come
to
you
yesterday
before
going
to
her
and
had
told
you
what
i
meant
to
do
and
explained
all
i
felt
how
the
love
of
years
ago
had
grown
in
me
again
you
have
given
me
a
friendly
hand
like
i
do
now
do
you
think
i
have
forgotten
one
night
when
she
stood
by
me
and
saved
me
from
cruel
treatment
and
then
nursed
me
when
i
fell
ill
neither
of
them
had
the
habit
of
making
long
speeches
they
understood
each
other
very
nearly
sufficiently
at
all
events
to
make
the
bond
of
sympathy
between
them
stronger
than
ever
jane
was
misled
a
little
for
she
thought
that
here
was
the
explanation
of
sidney
withdrawing
his
word
to
her
grandfather
doubtless
he
heard
of
the
calamity
when
it
happened
but
on
a
more
essential
point
she
fell
into
no
misconception
did
sidney
desire
that
she
should
he
held
her
hand
until
she
gently
drew
it
away
will
go
up
and
tell
grandfather
she
said
gravely
then
added
before
he
could
speak
i
just
see
him
first
for
a
minute
he
has
been
out
of
his
room
this
morning
yet
please
wait
here
she
left
him
and
sidney
fell
back
on
his
chair
woebegone
distracted
michael
brooding
sorrowfully
at
first
paid
no
heed
to
jane
when
she
entered
his
room
it
was
not
long
since
he
had
risen
and
his
simple
breakfast
scarcely
touched
was
still
on
the
table
kirkwood
is
here
and
wishes
to
speak
to
you
he
collected
himself
and
regarding
her
became
aware
that
she
was
strongly
moved
to
see
me
jane
then
i
suppose
he
came
to
see
you
first
prepared
now
for
anything
unexpected
feeling
that
the
links
between
himself
and
these
young
people
were
artificial
and
that
he
could
but
watch
as
if
from
a
distance
the
course
of
their
lives
his
first
supposition
was
that
sidney
had
again
altered
his
mind
he
spoke
coldly
and
had
little
inclination
for
the
interview
jane
replied
came
to
see
me
but
only
to
tell
me
that
he
is
going
to
be
married
his
wrinkled
face
slowly
gathered
an
expression
of
surprise
will
tell
you
who
it
is
he
will
explain
but
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
first
grandfather
i
was
afraid
you
might
say
something
about
me
will
you
will
you
forget
my
foolishness
will
you
think
of
me
as
you
did
before
when
he
has
spoken
to
you
you
will
understand
why
i
am
content
to
put
everything
out
of
my
mind
everything
you
and
i
talked
of
but
i
could
bear
for
him
to
know
how
i
have
disappointed
you
will
you
let
me
be
all
i
was
to
you
before
will
you
trust
me
again
grandfather
you
have
spoken
to
him
yet
about
me
have
you
michael
shook
his
head
you
will
let
it
be
as
if
nothing
had
happened
grandfather
she
bent
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
michael
looked
at
her
with
a
light
once
more
in
his
eyes
him
to
come
he
shall
hear
nothing
from
me
jane
you
will
try
to
forget
it
wish
nothing
better
tell
him
to
come
here
my
child
when
he
gone
we
talk
together
again
the
interview
did
not
last
long
and
sidney
left
the
house
without
seeing
jane
a
second
time
she
would
have
promised
anything
now
seeing
that
life
had
but
one
path
of
happiness
for
her
the
path
hopelessly
closed
what
did
it
matter
by
which
of
the
innumerable
other
ways
she
accomplished
her
sad
journey
for
an
instant
whilst
sidney
was
still
speaking
she
caught
a
gleam
of
hope
in
renunciation
itself
the
kind
of
strength
which
idealism
is
fond
of
attributing
to
noble
natures
a
gleam
only
and
deceptive
she
knew
it
too
well
after
the
day
spent
by
her
grandfather
side
encouraging
at
the
expense
of
her
heart
blood
all
his
revived
faith
in
her
but
she
would
not
again
give
way
the
old
man
should
reap
fruit
of
her
gratitude
and
sidney
should
never
suspect
how
nearly
she
had
proved
herself
unworthy
of
his
high
opinion
she
had
dreamed
her
dream
and
on
awaking
must
be
content
to
take
up
the
day
duties
just
in
the
same
way
when
she
was
a
child
at
peckover
did
not
sleep
often
bring
a
vision
of
happiness
of
freedom
from
bitter
tasks
and
had
she
not
to
wake
in
the
miserable
mornings
trembling
lest
she
had
lain
too
long
her
condition
was
greatly
better
than
then
so
much
better
that
it
seemed
wicked
folly
to
lament
because
one
joy
was
not
granted
why
in
the
meantime
she
had
forgotten
all
about
pennyloaf
that
visit
must
be
paid
the
first
thing
this
morning
chapter
xxxv
the
treasury
unlocked
a
sunday
morning
in
their
parlour
in
burton
crescent
and
joseph
snowdon
were
breakfasting
the
sound
of
church
bells
most
depressing
of
all
sounds
that
mingle
in
the
voice
of
london
intimated
that
it
was
nearly
eleven
but
neither
of
our
friends
had
in
view
the
attendance
of
public
worship
blended
odours
of
bacon
and
kippered
herrings
filled
the
room
indeed
the
house
for
several
breakfasts
were
in
progress
under
the
same
roof
for
a
wonder
the
morning
was
fine
even
sunny
a
yellow
patch
glimmered
on
the
worn
carpet
and
the
grime
of
the
was
visible
against
an
unfamiliar
sky
joseph
incompletely
dressed
had
a
sunday
paper
propped
before
him
and
read
whilst
he
ate
clem
also
in
anything
but
was
using
a
knife
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
to
her
mouth
the
juice
which
had
exuded
from
crisp
rashers
as
usual
they
had
very
little
to
say
to
each
other
clem
looked
at
her
husband
now
and
then
from
under
her
eyebrows
surreptitiously
after
one
of
these
glances
she
said
in
a
tone
which
was
not
exactly
hostile
but
had
a
note
of
suspicion
give
something
to
know
why
he
going
to
marry
clara
hewett
the
first
time
you
made
that
remark
returned
joseph
without
looking
up
from
his
paper
suppose
i
can
speak
yes
but
i
try
to
do
so
in
a
more
way
clem
flashed
at
him
a
gleam
of
hatred
he
had
become
fond
lately
of
drawing
attention
to
her
defects
of
breeding
clem
certainly
did
not
keep
up
with
his
own
progress
in
the
matter
of
external
refinement
his
comments
had
given
her
a
sense
of
inferiority
which
irritated
her
solely
as
meaning
that
she
was
not
his
equal
in
craft
she
let
a
minute
or
two
pass
then
returned
to
the
subject
something
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
know
that
of
course
you
know
more
about
it
than
you
pretend
joseph
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
regarded
her
with
a
smile
of
the
loftiest
scorn
never
occurs
to
you
to
explain
it
in
the
simplest
way
of
course
if
ever
you
hear
of
a
marriage
the
first
thing
you
ask
yourself
is
what
has
he
or
she
to
gain
by
it
natural
enough
in
you
now
do
you
really
suppose
that
all
marriages
come
about
in
the
way
that
did
on
your
side
i
mean
clem
was
far
too
to
be
capable
of
quick
retort
she
merely
replied
do
know
what
you
talking
about
course
not
but
let
me
assure
you
that
people
sometimes
think
of
other
things
besides
making
profit
when
they
get
married
it
a
pity
that
you
always
show
yourself
so
joseph
was
quite
serious
in
administering
this
rebuke
he
really
felt
himself
justified
in
holding
the
tone
of
moral
superiority
the
same
phenomenon
has
often
been
remarked
in
persons
conscious
that
their
affairs
are
prospering
and
whose
temptations
to
paltry
meanness
are
on
that
account
less
frequent
what
about
yourself
asked
his
wife
having
found
her
retort
at
length
did
you
want
to
marry
i
like
to
know
you
are
getting
too
modest
how
could
i
live
in
the
same
house
with
such
a
and
and
shut
up
she
exclaimed
in
a
voice
such
as
one
hears
at
the
was
just
because
you
thought
we
was
goin
to
be
fools
enough
to
keep
you
in
idleness
who
was
the
fool
after
all
joseph
smiled
and
returned
to
his
newspaper
in
satisfaction
at
having
reduced
him
to
silence
clem
laughed
aloud
and
clattered
with
the
knife
on
her
plate
as
she
was
doing
so
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
gentleman
wants
to
know
if
you
in
sir
said
the
showing
a
smeary
face
byass
is
the
name
byass
i
go
down
and
see
him
clem
face
became
alive
with
suspicion
in
spite
of
her
careless
attire
she
intercepted
joseph
and
bade
the
servant
ask
byass
to
come
upstairs
can
you
go
down
without
a
collar
she
said
to
her
husband
he
understood
and
was
somewhat
uneasy
but
made
no
resistance
byass
presented
himself
he
had
a
very
long
face
and
obviously
brought
news
of
grave
import
joseph
shook
hands
with
him
do
know
my
wife
i
think
byass
clem
nothing
wrong
i
hope
samuel
having
made
his
best
city
bow
swung
back
from
his
toes
to
his
heels
and
stood
looking
down
into
his
hat
sorry
to
say
he
began
with
extreme
gravity
snowdon
is
rather
ill
in
fact
very
miss
jane
asked
me
to
come
as
sharp
as
i
could
in
what
way
afraid
it
a
stroke
or
something
in
that
line
he
fell
down
without
a
word
of
warning
just
before
ten
he
lying
insensible
come
at
once
said
joseph
got
a
doctor
i
hope
the
doctor
had
been
summoned
instantly
go
with
you
said
clem
in
a
tone
of
decision
no
what
the
good
you
only
be
in
the
way
i
sha
if
he
as
bad
as
all
that
i
shall
come
both
withdrew
to
prepare
themselves
byass
who
was
very
nervous
and
perspiring
freely
began
to
walk
round
and
round
the
table
inspecting
closely
in
complete
absence
of
mind
the
objects
that
lay
on
it
have
a
cab
cried
joseph
as
he
came
forth
equipped
jane
in
a
sad
state
i
afraid
oh
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
driving
up
pentonville
road
clem
scarcely
ever
removed
her
eye
from
joseph
face
the
latter
held
his
lips
close
together
and
kept
his
brows
wrinkled
few
words
passed
during
the
drive
at
the
door
of
the
house
appeared
bessie
much
agitated
all
turned
into
the
parlour
on
the
ground
floor
and
spoke
together
for
a
few
minutes
michael
had
been
laid
on
his
bed
at
present
jane
only
was
with
him
but
the
doctor
would
return
shortly
you
tell
her
i
here
said
joseph
to
byass
see
her
in
the
he
went
up
and
waited
throughout
the
house
prevailed
that
unnatural
quietude
which
tells
the
presence
of
calamity
the
church
bells
had
ceased
ringing
and
sunday
silence
in
the
street
enhanced
the
effect
of
blankness
and
alarming
expectancy
joseph
could
not
keep
still
he
strained
his
ears
in
attention
to
any
slight
sound
that
might
come
from
the
floor
above
and
his
heart
beat
painfully
when
at
length
the
door
opened
jane
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
and
came
silently
forward
he
show
any
signs
of
coming
round
her
father
inquired
he
has
once
moved
she
spoke
only
just
above
a
whisper
the
shock
kept
her
still
trembling
and
her
face
bloodless
me
how
it
happened
jane
just
got
up
i
taken
him
his
breakfast
and
we
were
talking
all
at
once
he
began
to
turn
round
and
then
he
fell
down
before
i
could
reach
him
go
upstairs
shall
i
jane
could
not
overcome
her
fear
at
the
door
of
the
bedroom
she
drew
back
involuntarily
that
her
father
might
enter
before
her
when
she
forced
herself
to
follow
the
first
glimpse
of
the
motionless
form
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
the
thought
of
death
was
dreadful
to
her
and
death
seemed
to
lurk
invisibly
in
this
quiet
room
the
pale
sunlight
affected
her
as
a
mockery
of
hope
wo
go
away
again
father
she
whispered
he
shook
his
head
in
the
meantime
bessie
and
clem
were
conversing
on
the
single
previous
occasion
of
clem
visit
to
the
house
they
had
not
met
they
examined
each
other
looks
with
curiosity
clem
wished
it
were
possible
to
get
at
the
secrets
of
which
byass
was
doubtless
in
possession
bessie
on
her
side
was
reserved
circumspect
he
get
over
it
the
former
inquired
with
native
brutality
sure
i
do
know
i
hope
he
may
the
medical
man
arrived
and
when
he
came
downstairs
again
joseph
accompanied
him
clem
when
she
found
that
nothing
definite
could
be
learned
and
that
her
husband
had
no
intention
of
leaving
expressed
her
wish
to
walk
round
to
clerkenwell
close
and
see
her
mother
joseph
approved
better
have
dinner
there
he
said
to
her
privately
both
of
us
come
down
on
the
byasses
she
nodded
and
with
a
parting
glance
of
hostile
suspicion
set
forth
when
she
had
crossed
city
road
clem
foot
was
on
her
native
soil
she
bore
herself
with
conscious
importance
hoping
to
meet
some
acquaintance
who
would
be
impressed
by
her
attire
and
demeanour
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
however
it
was
the
dead
hour
of
sunday
morning
midway
in
and
long
before
the
opening
of
in
the
neighbourhood
of
those
places
of
refreshment
were
occasionally
found
small
groups
of
men
and
boys
standing
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
dispirited
seldom
caring
even
to
smoke
they
kicked
their
heels
against
the
kerbstone
and
sighed
for
one
clem
went
by
them
with
a
haughty
balance
of
her
head
as
she
entered
by
the
open
front
door
and
began
to
descend
the
kitchen
steps
familiar
sounds
were
audible
peckover
voice
was
raised
in
dispute
with
some
one
it
proved
to
be
a
quarrel
with
a
female
lodger
respecting
the
sum
of
alleged
by
the
landlady
to
be
owing
on
some
account
or
other
the
two
women
had
already
reached
the
point
of
calling
each
other
liar
and
thief
clem
having
no
acquaintance
with
the
lodger
walked
into
the
kitchen
with
an
air
of
contemptuous
indifference
the
quarrel
continued
for
another
ten
minutes
if
the
head
of
either
had
been
suddenly
cut
off
it
would
assuredly
have
gone
on
railing
for
an
appreciable
time
and
clem
waited
sitting
before
the
fire
at
last
the
lodger
had
departed
and
the
last
note
of
her
virulence
died
away
what
do
want
asked
peckover
turning
sharply
upon
her
daughter
suppose
i
can
come
to
see
you
ca
i
to
see
me
likely
when
did
you
come
last
you
a
ungrateful
beast
that
what
you
are
right
go
anything
else
you
like
to
call
me
peckover
was
hurt
by
the
completeness
with
which
clem
had
established
her
independence
to
do
the
woman
justice
she
had
been
actuated
in
her
design
of
capturing
joseph
snowdon
at
least
as
much
by
a
wish
to
establish
her
daughter
satisfactorily
as
by
the
instinct
which
bade
her
seize
whenever
gain
lay
near
her
clutches
clem
was
proving
disloyal
had
grown
secretive
peckover
did
not
look
for
any
direct
profit
worth
speaking
of
from
the
marriage
she
had
brought
about
but
she
did
desire
the
joy
of
continuing
to
plot
against
joseph
with
his
wife
moreover
she
knew
that
clem
was
a
bungler
altogether
lacking
in
astuteness
and
her
soul
was
pained
by
the
thought
of
chances
being
missed
her
encounter
with
the
lodger
had
wrought
her
up
to
the
point
at
which
she
could
discuss
matters
with
clem
frankly
the
two
abused
each
other
for
a
while
but
clem
really
desired
to
communicate
her
news
so
that
calmer
dialogue
presently
ensued
snowdon
had
a
stroke
if
you
like
to
know
and
it
my
belief
he
wo
get
over
it
belief
and
what
your
belief
worth
had
a
stroke
has
he
who
told
you
just
come
from
the
jo
stoppin
there
they
discussed
the
situation
in
all
its
aspects
but
peckover
gave
it
clearly
to
be
understood
that
from
her
point
of
view
game
was
spoilt
as
long
as
joseph
continued
living
under
her
roof
she
could
in
a
measure
direct
the
course
of
events
clem
had
chosen
to
abet
him
in
his
desire
for
removal
and
if
ill
came
of
it
she
had
only
herself
to
blame
can
look
out
for
myself
said
clem
you
i
glad
to
hear
it
and
peckover
sniffed
the
air
scornfully
the
affectionate
pair
dined
together
each
imbibing
a
pint
and
a
half
of
and
bitter
and
clem
returned
to
hanover
street
from
joseph
she
could
derive
no
information
as
to
the
state
of
the
patient
you
will
stay
here
where
you
can
do
no
good
he
said
down
and
keep
quiet
i
shall
stay
said
his
wife
i
know
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
joseph
left
her
in
the
and
went
upstairs
again
to
keep
his
daughter
company
jane
would
not
leave
the
bedside
to
enter
the
room
after
an
interval
elsewhere
wrung
her
feelings
too
painfully
better
to
keep
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
unmoving
form
to
overcome
the
dread
by
facing
it
she
and
her
father
seldom
exchanged
a
word
the
latter
was
experiencing
human
emotion
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
no
little
anxiety
regarding
his
material
interests
it
was
ten
days
since
he
had
learnt
that
there
was
no
longer
the
least
fear
of
a
marriage
between
jane
and
sidney
seeing
that
kirkwood
was
going
to
marry
some
one
else
a
piece
of
news
which
greatly
astonished
him
and
confirmed
him
in
his
judgment
that
he
had
been
on
the
wrong
tack
in
judging
kirkwood
character
at
the
same
time
he
had
been
privily
informed
by
scawthorne
of
an
event
which
had
ever
since
kept
him
very
uneasy
michael
withdrawal
of
his
will
from
the
hands
of
the
solicitors
with
what
purpose
this
had
been
done
scawthorne
could
not
conjecture
percival
had
made
no
comment
in
his
hearing
in
all
likelihood
the
will
was
now
in
this
very
room
joseph
surveyed
every
object
again
and
again
he
wondered
whether
jane
knew
anything
of
the
matter
but
not
all
his
cynicism
could
persuade
him
that
at
the
present
time
her
thoughts
were
taking
the
same
direction
as
his
own
the
day
waned
its
sombre
close
was
unspeakably
mournful
in
this
haunted
chamber
jane
could
not
bear
it
she
hid
her
face
and
wept
when
the
doctor
came
again
at
six
he
whispered
to
joseph
that
the
end
was
nearer
than
he
had
anticipated
near
indeed
less
than
ten
minutes
after
the
warning
had
been
given
michael
ceased
to
breathe
jane
knelt
by
the
bed
convulsed
with
grief
unable
to
hear
the
words
her
father
addressed
to
her
he
sat
for
five
minutes
then
again
spoke
she
rose
and
replied
you
come
with
us
jane
or
would
rather
stay
with
mrs
byass
will
stay
please
father
he
hesitated
but
the
thought
that
rose
was
even
for
him
too
ignoble
to
be
entertained
you
please
my
dear
of
course
no
one
must
enter
your
rooms
but
byass
i
must
go
now
but
i
shall
look
in
again
father
she
spoke
mechanically
he
had
to
lead
her
from
the
room
and
on
quitting
the
house
left
her
all
but
unconscious
in
bessie
arms
chapter
xxxvi
the
heir
you
mean
to
say
cried
clem
when
she
was
in
the
cab
with
her
husband
speeding
back
to
burton
crescent
mean
to
say
as
left
them
people
to
do
what
they
like
suppose
i
know
my
own
business
re
plied
joseph
wishing
to
convey
the
very
impression
which
in
fact
he
did
that
he
had
the
will
in
his
pocket
on
reaching
home
he
sat
down
at
once
and
penned
a
letter
to
percival
peel
formally
apprising
them
of
what
had
happened
clem
sat
by
and
watched
him
having
sealed
the
envelope
he
remarked
going
out
for
a
couple
of
hours
i
shall
go
with
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
why
what
do
you
mean
you
great
gaping
fool
the
agitation
of
his
nerves
made
him
break
into
unaccustomed
violence
you
suppose
you
going
to
follow
me
everywhere
for
the
next
week
are
you
afraid
i
shall
run
away
if
i
mean
to
do
so

think
you
can
stop
me
you
just
wait
here
till
i
come
back
which
will
be
before
ten
do
you
hear
she
looked
at
him
fiercely
but
his
energy
was
too
much
for
her
and
perforce
she
let
him
go
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
house
she
too
sat
down
and
indited
a
letter
it
ran
thus
mother

old
feller

may
take
your
hothe
so
i
remain
this
document
she
took
to
the
nearest
then
returned
and
sat
brooding
by
the
first
hansom
available
joseph
was
driven
right
across
london
to
a
certain
dull
street
in
chelsea
before
dismissing
the
vehicle
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
and
made
inquiry
for
scawthorne
to
his
surprise
and
satisfaction
scawthorne
happened
to
be
at
home
so
the
cabman
was
paid
and
joseph
went
up
to
the
second
floor
in
his
shabby
little
room
scawthorne
sat
smoking
and
reading
it
was
a
season
of
impecuniosity
with
him
and
his
mood
was
anything
but
cheerful
he
did
not
rise
when
his
visitor
entered
now
what
do
you
think
brings
me
here
exclaimed
joseph
when
he
had
carefully
closed
the
door
if
i
know
but
it
does
seem
to
be
particularly
bad
news
indeed
joseph
had
overcome
his
sensibilities
by
this
time
and
his
aspect
was
one
of
joyous
excitement
seeing
on
the
table
a
bottle
of
sherry
loosely
corked
he
pointed
to
it
you
do
mind
scaw
i
a
bit
upset
a
bit
flurried
got
another
from
the
cupboard
scawthorne
produced
one
and
bade
the
visitor
help
himself
his
face
began
to
express
curiosity
joseph
tilted
the
draught
down
his
throat
and
showed
satisfaction
does
me
good
i
had
a
troublesome
day
it
ai
often
my
feelings
are
tried
what
is
it
boy
we
are
all
mortal
i
dare
say
you
heard
that
observation
before
can
you
apply
it
to
any
particular
case
scawthorne
was
startled
he
delayed
a
moment
before
speaking
do
mean
to
say
died
a
couple
of
hours
ago
after
lying
insensible
all
day
poor
old
man
i
just
written
your
people
a
formal
announcement
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
if
you
do
mind
old
fellow
he
filled
himself
another
glass
and
tilted
it
off
as
before
scawthorne
had
dropped
his
eyes
to
the
ground
and
stood
in
meditation
what
about
the
will
pursued
joseph
have
looked
for
it
questioned
his
friend
with
an
odd
look
it
more
decent
to
wait
a
few
hours
the
girl
was
about
you
see
and
what
more
my
wife
was
but
have
you
heard
anything
since
i
saw
you
yes
a
trifle
with
it
what
are
you
grinning
about
do
keep
me
on
hot
coals
it
amusing
and
that
the
fact
take
another
glass
of
sherry
you
need
support
i
prepared
for
the
worst
he
cut
me
out
altogether
eh
that
comes
of
me
meddling
with
the
girl
affairs
damnation
when
there
was
the
least
need
either
bad
job
the
fact
is
percival
had
a
letter
from
him
at
midday
yesterday
the
senior
had
left
the
office
young
percival
opened
the
letter
and
spoke
to
me
about
it
now
prepare
yourself
the
letter
said
that
he
had
destroyed
his
former
will
and
would
come
to
the
office
on
monday
that
to
give
instructions
for
a
new
one
joseph
stood
and
stared
why
then
there
will
at
admirable
deduction
i
congratulate
you
on
your
logic
snowdon
flung
up
his
arms
wildly
then
began
to
leap
about
the
room
another
glass
said
scawthorne
still
a
bottle
in
the
cupboard
do
be
afraid
you
mean
to
tell
me
it
all
mine
wine
you
very
welcome
be
damned
the
money
my
boy
the
money
scawthorne
i
not
a
mean
chap
as
sure
as
you
and
me
stand
here
you
shall
have
you
shall
have
a
hundred
pounds
i
mean
it
dash
me
i
mean
it
you
been
devilish
useful
to
me
and
what
more
i
have
done
with
you
yet
do
you
twig
old
boy
mean
that
a
confidential
agent
in
england
unsuspected
may
be
needed
wonder
if
i
do
be
managed
under
double
the
money
my
good
sir
observed
scawthorne
with
unmistakable
seriousness
your
while
i
promise
you
have
another
glass
fair
commission
think
it
over
here
i
shall
have
to
make
the
girl
an
allowance
the
do
be
stingy
joseph
was
growing
very
red
in
the
face
he
drank
glass
after
glass
he
flung
his
arms
about
he
capered
me
if
you
shall
call
me
that
scaw
two
hundred
it
shall
be
but
what
was
the
old
cove
up
to
why
did
he
destroy
the
other
will
what
would
the
new
one
have
been
answer
either
question
but
it
probably
as
well
for
you
that
never
comes
just
see
how
things
turn
out
went
on
the
other
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
the
thought
and
the
trouble
that
i
gone
through
this
last
year
when
i
might
have
taken
it
easy
and
waited
for
chance
to
make
me
rich
look
at
kirkwood
business
there
was
you
and
me
knocking
our
heads
together
and
raising
lumps
on
them
as
you
may
say
to
find
out
a
plan
of
keeping
him
and
jane
apart
when
all
the
while
we
nothing
to
do
but
to
look
on
and
wait
if
only
we
known
now
this
is
what
i
call
the
working
of
providence
scawthorne
who
going
to
say
after
this
that
things
ai
as
they
should
be
for
the
best
my
boy
i
see
that
clearly
enough
assented
scawthorne
with
a
smile
honest
man
is
always
rewarded
in
the
long
run
and
that
reminds
me
i
too
have
had
a
stroke
of
luck
he
went
on
to
relate
that
his
position
in
the
office
of
percival
peel
was
now
nominally
that
of
an
articled
clerk
and
that
in
three
time
if
all
went
well
he
would
be
received
in
the
firm
as
junior
partner
only
one
little
project
i
am
sorry
to
give
up
in
connection
with
your
affairs
snowdon
if
it
had
happened
that
your
daughter
had
inherited
the
money
why
should
i
have
had
the
honour
of
becoming
your
joseph
stared
then
burst
into
hearty
laughter
tell
you
what
he
said
recovering
himself
should
you
give
up
that
idea
she
as
good
a
girl
as
you
ever
come
across
i
can
tell
you
that
my
boy
there
but
you
wo
find
many
as
modest
and
just
make
her
acquaintance
and
tell
me
if
i
deceived
you
and
look
here
scawthorne
by
george
i
make
a
bargain
with
you
you
say

a
partner
in
three
years

jane
when
that
day
comes
and
i
give
you
a
thousand
for
a
wedding

mean
it
what
more
i
make
my
will
on
your
and
leave
everything
i
got
to
you
and
her
there
now
makes
you
so
benevolent
all
at
once
inquired
scawthorne
blandly
you
think
i
got
no
fatherly
feeling
man
why
if
it
was
for
my
wife
i
ask
nothing
better
than
to
settle
down
with
jane
to
keep
house
for
me
she
a
good
girl
i
tell
you
and
i
wish
her
happiness

you
think
i
exactly
the
man
to
make
her
a
model
husband

see
why
not
now
you
going
to
be
a
partner
in
a
good
business

you
think
i
ten
times
as
honest
a
man
as
i
was
yesterday
poor
devils
ca
afford
to
be
what
they
wish
in
the
way
of
honesty
and
decent
living
true
enough
for
once

the
other
without
irony

it
over
scaw
i
a
man
of
my
word

shall
have
your
money
as
soon
as
things
are
straight
and
if
you
can
bring
about
that
affair

do
all
i
said
so
there
my
hand

the
word
and
i
make
you
acquainted
with
her

take
that
little
trip

know
of

my
health

of
it
again
thereupon
they
parted
in
the
course
of
the
following
day
report
received
official
confirmation
joseph
pondered
deeply
with
himself
whether
he
should
tell
his
wife
the
truth
or
not
there
were
arguments
for
both
courses
by
tuesday
morning
he
had
decided
for
the
truth
that
would
give
more
piquancy
to
a
pleasant
little
jest
he
had
in
mind
at
breakfast
he
informed
her
as
if
casually
and
it
amused
him
to
see
that
she
did
not
believe
him
be
anxious
to
tell
your
mother
go
and
spend
the
day
with
her
but
be
back

five

things
over

have
business
with
the
lawyers
again
clem
repaired
to
the
close
late
in
the
afternoon
she
and
her
husband
again
met
at
home
and
by
this
time
joseph
elation
had
convinced
her
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
never
had
he
been
in
such
a
suave
humour
he
seemed
to
wish
to
make
up
for
his
late
severities
seating
himself
near
her
he
began
pleasantly
things
might
have
been
worse
eh
they
might
have
spoken
to
jane
yet
time
enough
after
the
funeral
what
shall
we
do
for
the
poor
girl
eh
do
i
know
wo
grudge
her
a
couple
of
pounds
a
week
or
so
just
to
enable
her
to
live
with
the
byasses
as
she
has
been
doing
the
money

own
to
do
what

with
kind
of
you

say

be
polite

each
other
where

a
house
clem
would
you
like
to
be
a
bit
out
of
town
there
very
nice
places
within
easy
reach
of
king
cross
you

on
the
great
northern
a
man

at
potter
bar
and
finds
it
very
pleasant
good
air
of
course
i
must
be
within
easy
reach
of
business
she
kept
drawing
her
nails
over
a
fold
in
her
dress
making
a
scratchy
sound
happened
just
at
the
right
time
he
continued
business
wants
a
little
more
capital
put
into
it
i
tell
you
what
it
is
clem
in
a
year
or

be
coining

old
girl
you
enough
there
just
one
thing
i
a
little
anxious
about
you
wo
mind
me
mentioning
it
do
you
think
your
mother
expect
us
to
do
anything
for
her
clem
regarded
him
with
cautious
scrutiny
he
was
acting
well
and
her
profound
distrust
began
to
be
mingled
with
irritating
uncertainty
can
she
expect
if
she
does
she
have
to
be
disappointed
that
all
do
want
to
seem
mean
you
know
but
then
she
is
so
badly
herself
is
she
know
nothing
about
it
you
better
ask
her
and
clem
grinned
thereupon
joseph
struck
a
facetious
note
and
for
half
an
hour
made
himself
very
agreeable
now
for
the
first
time
he
said
could
he
feel
really
settled
life
was
smooth
before
him
they
would
have
a
comfortable
home
the
kind
of
place
to
which
he
could
invite
his
friends
one
or
two
excellent
fellows
he
knew
would
bring
their
wives
and
so
clem
would
have
more
society
you
learn
the
piano
old
girl
it
would
be
amiss
i
hope
they
turn
you
out
some
creditable
mourning
have
to
find
a
west
end
dressmaker
she
listened
and
from
time
to
time
smiled
ambiguously
at
noon
of
the
next
day
clem
was
walking
on
that
part
of
the
thames
embankment
which
is
between
waterloo
bridge
and
the
temple
pier
it
was
a
mild
morning
misty
but
illuminated
now
and
then
with
rays
of
sunlight
which
gleamed
dully
upon
the
river
and
gave
a
yellowness
to
remote
objects
at
the
distance
of
a
dozen
paces
walked
bob
hewett
the
two
had
had
a
difference
in
their
conversation
and
for
some
minutes
kept
thus
apart
looking
sullenly
at
the
ground
clem
turned
aside
and
leaned
her
arms
on
the
parapet
presently
her
companion
drew
near
and
leaned
in
the
same
manner
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
huskily
speak
plain
ca
you
you
ca
understand
if
you
that
is
it
no
good
speakin
plainer
said
the
other
night
as
you
did
care
about
his
money
if
you
think
he
means
hookin
it
let
him
go
and
good
riddance
a
fool
way
of
talkin
i
not
goin
to
lose
it
all
if
i
can
help
it
there
a
way
of
stoppin
him
and
of
gettin
the
money
too
they
both
stared
down
at
the
water
it
was
full
tide
and
the
muddy
surface
looked
almost
solid
would
get
it
all
were
bob
next
words
been
asking
about
that
have
who
did
you
ask
a
feller
you
do
know
you
only
have
a
third
part
of
it
and
the
girl
get
the
rest
do
you
call
a
third
part
so
complete
was
her
stupidity
that
bob
had
to
make
a
laborious
explanation
of
this
mathematical
term
she
could
have
understood
what
was
meant
by
a
half
or
a
quarter
but
the
unfamiliar
conveyed
no
distinct
meaning
do
care
she
said
at
length
be
enough
you
better
leave
this
job
alone
you
better
i
warn
you
sha
another
long
silence
a
steamboat
drew
up
to
the
temple
pier
and
a
yellow
shaft
of
sunlight
fell
softly
upon
its
track
in
the
water
do
you
want
me
to
do
bob
recommenced
their
eyes
met
and
in
the
woman
gaze
he
found
a
horrible
fascination
a
devilish
allurement
to
that
which
his
soul
shrank
from
she
lowered
her
voice
lots
of
ways
it
be
easy
to
make
it
seem
as
somebody
did
it
just
to
rob
him
he
always
out
late
at
night
his
face
was
much
the
colour
of
the
muddy
water
yellowed
by
that
shaft
of
sunlight
his
lips
quivered
durs
clem
i
tell
you
plain
i
durs
she
snarled
at
him
savagely
all
right
bob
you
go
your
way
and
i
go
mine
here
clem
he
gasped
out
laying
his
hand
on
her
arm
think
about
it
i
wo
say
no
give
me
a
day
to
think
about
it
we
know
what
your
thinkin
means
they
talked
for
some
time
longer
and
before
they
parted
bob
had
given
a
promise
to
do
more
than
think
the
long
slouching
strides
with
which
he
went
up
from
the
embankment
to
the
strand
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
man
partly
overcome
with
drink
for
hours
he
walked
about
the
city
in
complete
oblivion
of
everything
external
only
when
the
lights
began
to
shine
from
did
he
consciously
turn
to
his
own
district
it
was
raining
now
the
splashes
of
cool
moisture
made
him
aware
how
feverishly
hot
his
face
was
when
he
got
among
the
familiar
streets
he
went
slinkingly
hurrying
round
corners
avoiding
glances
almost
at
a
run
he
turned
into
merlin
place
and
he
burst
into
his
room
as
though
he
were
pursued
pennyloaf
had
now
but
one
child
to
look
after
a
girl
of
two
years
a
feeble
thing
her
own
state
was
wretched
professedly
recovered
from
illness
she
felt
so
weak
so
that
the
greater
part
of
her
day
was
spent
in
crying
the
least
exertion
was
too
much
for
her
but
for
frequent
visits
from
jane
snowdon
she
must
have
perished
for
very
lack
of
wholesome
food
she
was
crying
when
startled
by
her
husband
entrance
and
though
she
did
her
best
to
hide
the
signs
of
it
bob
saw
are
you
going
to
stop
that
he
shouted
she
shrank
away
looking
at
him
with
fear
in
her
red
eyes
your
snivelling
and
get
me
some
tea
it
was
only
of
late
that
pennyloaf
had
come
to
regard
him
with
fear
his
old
indifference
and
occasional
brutality
of
language
had
made
her
life
a
misery
but
she
had
never
looked
for
his
return
home
with
anything
but
anxious
longing
now
the
anticipation
was
mingled
with
dread
he
not
only
had
no
care
for
her
not
only
showed
that
he
felt
her
a
burden
upon
him
his
disposition
now
was
one
of
hatred
and
the
kind
of
hatred
which
sooner
or
later
breaks
out
in
ferocity
bob
would
not
have
come
to
this
pass
at
all
events
not
so
soon
if
he
had
been
left
to
the
dictates
of
his
own
nature
he
was
infected
by
the
savagery
of
the
woman
who
had
taken
possession
of
him
her
lust
of
cruelty
crept
upon
him
like
a
disease
the
progress
of
which
was
hastened
by
all
the
circumstances
of
his
disorderly
life
the
man
was
conscious
of
his
degradation
he
knew
how
he
had
fallen
ever
since
he
began
criminal
practices
he
knew
the
increasing
hopelessness
of
his
resolves
to
have
done
with
dangers
and
recover
his
peace
of
mind
the
loss
of
his
daily
work
in
consequence
of
irregularity
was
the
last
thing
needed
to
complete
his
ruin
he
did
not
even
try
to
get
new
employment
feeling
that
such
a
show
of
honest
purpose
was
useless
corruption
was
eating
to
his
heart
from
every
interview
with
clem
he
came
away
a
feebler
and
a
baser
being
and
upon
the
unresisting
creature
who
shared
his
home
he
had
begun
to
expend
the
fury
of
his
he
hated
her
because
clem
bade
him
do
so
he
hated
her
because
her
suffering
rebuked
him
because
he
must
needs
be
at
the
cost
of
keeping
her
alive
because
he
was
bound
to
her
as
she
moved
painfully
about
the
room
he
watched
her
with
cruel
dangerous
eyes
there
was
a
thought
tormenting
his
brain
a
terrifying
thought
he
had
pledged
himself
not
to
dismiss
and
it
seemed
to
exasperate
him
against
pennyloaf
he
had
horrible
impulses
twitches
along
his
muscles
every
second
the
restraint
of
keeping
in
one
position
grew
more
unendurable
yet
he
feared
to
move
pennyloaf
had
the
to
drop
a
saucer
and
it
broke
on
the
floor
in
the
same
instant
he
leapt
up
and
sprang
on
her
seized
her
brutally
by
the
shoulders
and
flung
her
with
all
his
force
against
the
nearest
wall
at
her
scream
the
child
set
up
a
shrill
cry
and
this
increased
his
rage
with
his
clenched
fist
he
dealt
blow
after
blow
at
the
woman
speaking
no
word
but
uttering
a
strange
sound
such
as
might
come
from
some
infuriate
animal
pennyloaf
still
screamed
till
at
length
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
their
neighbour
griffin
showed
herself
i
never
she
cried
wrathfully
rushing
upon
bob
you
just
stop
that
young
man
i
thought
it
be
comin
to
this
before
long
i
saw
you
was
goin
that
way
the
mildness
of
her
expressions
was
partly
a
personal
characteristic
partly
due
to
griffin
very
large
experience
of
such
scenes
as
this
indignant
she
might
be
but
the
situation
could
not
move
her
to
any
unwonted
force
of
utterance
enough
that
bob
drew
back
as
soon
as
he
was
bidden
and
seemed
from
his
silence
to
be
of
himself
pennyloaf
let
herself
lie
at
full
length
on
the
floor
her
hands
clutched
protectingly
about
her
head
she
sobbed
in
a
quick
terrified
way
and
appeared
powerless
to
stop
even
when
griffin
tried
to
raise
her
he
been
you
like
this
for
the
woman
kept
asking
there
now
he
sha
hit
you
no
more
he
sha
whilst
she
spoke
bob
turned
away
and
went
from
the
room
from
merlin
place
he
struck
off
into
pentonville
and
walked
towards
king
cross
at
his
utmost
speed
not
that
he
had
any
object
in
hastening
but
a
frenzy
goaded
him
along
faster
faster
till
the
sweat
poured
from
him
from
king
cross
northwards
out
to
holloway
to
hornsey
a
light
rain
was
ceaselessly
falling
at
one
time
he
took
off
his
hat
and
walked
some
distance
bareheaded
because
it
was
a
pleasure
to
feel
the
rain
trickle
over
him
from
hornsey
by
a
great
circuit
he
made
back
for
islington
here
he
went
into
a
to
quench
the
thirst
that
had
grown
unbearable
he
had
but
a
shilling
in
his
pocket
and
in
bringing
it
out
he
was
reminded
of
the
necessity
of
getting
more
money
he
was
to
have
met
jack
bartley
long
before
this
hour
he
took
the
direction
for
smithfield
and
soon
reached
the
alley
near
bartholomew
hospital
where
bartley
dwelt
as
he
entered
the
street
he
saw
a
small
crowd
gathered
about
a
door
he
hurried
nearer
and
found
that
the
object
of
interest
was
a
man
in
the
clutch
of
two
others
the
latter
he
perceived
at
a
glance
were
in
plain
clothes
the
man
arrested
was
jack
bartley
himself
jack
was
beside
himself
with
terror
he
had
only
that
moment
been
brought
out
of
the
bar
and
was
pleading
shrilly
in
an
agony
of
cowardice
ai
me
as
made
i
never
made
one
in
my
life
i
tell
you
who
it
is
i
tell
you
where
to
find
him
it
bob
hewett
as
lives
in
merlin
place
you
took
the
wrong
man
it
ai
me
as
made
tell
you
the
whole
truth
or
may
i
never
speak
another
word
it
bob
hewett
made
all
he
lives
in
merlin
place
clerkenwell
i
tell
you
thus
far
had
bob
heard
before
he
recovered
sufficiently
from
the
shock
to
move
a
limb
the
officers
were
urging
their
prisoner
forward
grinning
and
nodding
to
each
other
whilst
several
voices
from
the
crowd
shouted
abusively
at
the
poltroon
whose
first
instinct
was
to
betray
his
associate
bob
turned
his
face
away
and
walked
on
he
did
not
dare
to
run
yet
the
noises
behind
him
kept
his
heart
leaping
with
dread
a
few
paces
and
he
was
out
of
the
alley
even
yet
he
durst
not
run
he
had
turned
in
the
unlucky
direction
the
crowd
was
still
following
for
five
minutes
he
had
to
keep
advancing
then
at
last
he
was
able
to
move
off
at
right
angles
the
crowd
passed
the
end
of
the
street
only
then
did
complete
panic
get
possession
of
him
with
a
bound
forward
like
that
of
a
stricken
animal
he
started
in
blind
flight
he
came
to
a
crossing
and
rushed
upon
it
regardless
of
the
traffic
before
he
could
gain
the
farther
pavement
the
shaft
of
a
cart
struck
him
on
the
breast
and
threw
him
down
the
vehicle
was
going
at
a
slow
pace
and
could
be
stopped
almost
immediately
he
was
not
touched
by
the
wheel
a
man
helped
him
to
his
feet
and
inquired
if
he
were
hurt
no
no
it
all
right
to
the
surprise
of
those
who
had
witnessed
the
accident
he
walked
quickly
on
scarcely
feeling
any
pain
but
in
a
few
minutes
there
came
a
sense
of
nausea
and
a
warm
rush
in
his
throat
he
staggered
against
the
wall
and
vomited
a
quantity
of
blood
again
he
was
surrounded
by
sympathising
people
again
he
made
himself
free
of
them
and
hastened
on
but
by
now
he
suffered
acutely
he
could
not
run
so
great
was
the
pain
it
cost
him
when
he
began
to
breathe
quickly
his
mouth
was
full
of
blood
again
where
could
he
find
a
the
hunters
were
after
him
and
however
great
his
suffering
he
must
go
through
it
in
secrecy
but
in
what
house
could
he
take
refuge
he
had
not
money
enough
to
pay
for
a
lodging
he
looked
about
him
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
by
this
time
the
police
would
have
visited
merlin
place
they
would
be
waiting
there
to
trap
him
he
was
tempted
towards
farringdon
road
buildings
surely
his
father
would
not
betray
him
and
he
was
in
such
dire
need
of
kindly
help
but
it
would
not
be
safe
the
police
would
search
there
shooter
gardens
there
was
the
room
where
lived
pennyloaf
drunken
mother
and
her
brother
they
would
not
give
him
up
he
could
think
of
no
other
refuge
at
all
events
and
must
go
there

mad
jack
dream
it
was
not
much
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
walk
but
pain
and
fear
made
the
distance
seem
long
he
went
out
of
his
way
too
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
places
that
were
too
well
lighted
the
chief
occupation
of
his
thoughts
was
in
conjecturing
what
could
have
led
to
bartley
arrest
had
the
fellow
been
such
a
fool
as
to
attempt
passing
a
bad
coin
when
he
carried
others
of
the
same
kind
in
his
pocket
or
had
the
arrest
of
some
other
in
some
way
thrown
suspicion
on
jack
be
it
as
it
might
the
game
was
up
with
the
usual
wisdom
which
comes
too
late
bob
asked
himself
how
he
could
ever
have
put
trust
in
bartley
whom
he
knew
to
be
as
a
cur
as
breathed
on
the
chance
of
making
things
easier
for
himself
jack
would
betray
every
secret
in
his
possession
what
hope
was
there
of
escaping
capture
even
if
a
could
be
found
for
a
day
or
two
if
he
had
his
hand
on
jack
bartley
gizzard
afraid
to
appear
afraid
in
dread
lest
his
muddy
clothing
should
attract
observation
he
kept
as
often
as
possible
the
middle
of
the
road
and
with
relief
saw
at
length
the
narrow
archway
with
its
descending
steps
which
was
one
entrance
to
shooter
gardens
as
usual
two
or
three
loafers
were
hanging
about
here
exchanging
blasphemies
and
filthy
vocables
but
even
if
they
recognised
him
there
was
not
much
fear
of
their
giving
assistance
to
the
police
with
head
bent
he
slouched
past
them
unchallenged
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
where
he
was
in
all
but
utter
darkness
his
foot
slipped
on
garbage
of
some
kind
and
with
a
groan
he
fell
on
his
side
him
that
thinketh
he
standeth
take
heed
lest
he
fall
cried
a
voice
from
close
by
bob
knew
that
the
speaker
was
the
man
notorious
in
this
locality
as
mad
jack
raising
himself
with
difficulty
he
looked
round
and
saw
a
shape
crouching
in
the
corner
is
the
principal
thing
continued
the
crazy
voice
is
the
principal
thing
and
upon
that
followed
a
long
speech
which
to
bob
sounded
as
gibberish
but
which
was
in
truth
tolerably
good
french
a
language
mad
jack
was
fond
of
using
though
he
never
made
known
how
he
had
acquired
it
bob
stumbled
on
and
quickly
came
to
the
house
where
he
hoped
to
find
a
refuge
the
door
was
of
course
open
he
went
in
and
groped
his
way
up
the
staircase
a
knock
at
the
door
of
the
room
which
he
believed
to
be
still
tenanted
by
candy
and
her
son
brought
no
reply
he
turned
the
handle
but
found
that
the
door
was
locked
it
was
not
late
only
about
ten
stephen
candy
could
not
of
course
be
back
yet
from
his
work
and
the
woman
was
probably
drinking
somewhere
but
he
must
make
sure
that
they
still
lived
here
going
down
to
the
floor
below
he
knocked
at
the
room
occupied
by
the
hope
family
and
hope
opening
the
door
a
few
inches
asked
his
business
candy
still
live
upstairs
he
inquired
in
a
feigned
voice
and
standing
back
in
the
darkness
all
i
know
and
the
door
closed
sharply
he
had
no
choice
but
to
wait
and
see
if
either
of
his
acquaintances
returned
for
a
few
minutes
he
sat
on
the
staircase
but
as
at
any
moment
some
one
might
stumble
over
him
he
went
down
to
the
backdoor
which
was
open
like
that
in
front
and
passed
out
into
the
yard
here
he
seated
himself
on
the
ground
leaning
against
a
corner
of
the
wall
he
was
suffering
much
from
his
injury
but
could
at
all
events
feel
secure
from
the
hunters
the
stones
were
wet
and
rain
fell
upon
him
as
he
looked
up
at
the
lighted
windows
in
the
back
of
the
house
he
thought
of
pennyloaf
who
by
this
time
most
likely
knew
his
danger
would
she
be
glad
of
it
feeling
herself
revenged
his
experience
of
her
did
not
encourage
him
to
believe
that
to
all
his
she
had
never
answered
with
anything
but
tears
and
submission
he
found
himself
wishing
she
were
near
to
be
helpful
to
him
in
his
suffering
clem
could
not
learn
immediately
what
had
come
to
pass
finding
he
did
not
keep
his
appointment
for
the
day
after
she
would
conclude
that
he
had
drawn
back
but
perhaps
jack
bartley
case
would
be
in
the
newspapers
on
that
day
and
his
own
name
might
appear
in
the
evidence
before
the
magistrates
if
clem
learnt
the
truth
in
that
way
she
would
be
not
a
little
surprised
he
had
never
hinted
to
her
the
means
by
which
he
had
been
obtaining
money
voices
began
to
sound
from
the
passage
within
the
house
several
young
fellows
one
or
other
of
whom
probably
lived
here
had
entered
to
be
out
of
the
rain
one
voice
very
loud
and
brutal
bob
quickly
recognised
it
was
that
of
ned
higgs
the
ruffian
with
whom
wife
had
taken
up
the
conversation
was
very
easy
to
overhear
it
contained
no
reference
to
the
of
jack
ends
this
and
that
voice
kept
crying
bob
understood
one
of
the
noble
company
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
pig
up
the
end
of
a
cigar
somewhere
and
it
was
the
rule
among
them
that
he
who
called
out
ends
established
a
claim
for
a
few
whiffs
in
this
way
the
delicacy
was
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
that
the
game
should
end
in
quarrel
was
quite
in
order
and
sure
enough
before
very
long
ned
higgs
was
roaring
his
defiances
to
a
companion
who
had
seized
the
bit
of
tobacco
unjustly
after
snuffy
bill
a
liar
i
did
you
a
i
your
in
arf
a
second
then
came
the
sound
of
a
scuffle
the
thud
of
blows
the
bellowing
of
infuriate
voices
above
all
could
be
heard
the
roar
of
ned
higgs
a
rush
and
it
was
plain
that
the
combatants
had
gone
out
into
the
alley
to
have
more
room
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
yells
from
their
throats
echoed
among
the
buildings
quietness
was
probably
caused
by
the
interference
of
police
knowing
that
bob
shrank
together
in
his
when
all
had
been
still
for
some
time
he
resolved
to
go
upstairs
again
and
try
the
door
for
his
breathing
grew
more
and
more
painful
and
there
was
a
whirling
in
his
head
which
made
him
fear
that
he
might
become
insensible
to
rise
was
more
difficult
than
he
had
imagined
his
head
overweighted
him
all
but
caused
him
to
plunge
forward
he
groped
this
way
and
that
with
his
hands
seeking
vainly
for
something
to
cling
to
on
the
whitewashed
wall
in
his
depth
of
utter
misery
he
gave
way
and
sobbed
several
times
then
once
more
he
had
the
warm
taste
of
blood
in
his
mouth
he
staggered
into
the
house
this
time
a
voice
answered
to
his
knock
he
opened
the
door
the
room
contained
no
article
of
furniture
in
one
corner
lay
some
rags
and
on
the
stood
a
tin
teapot
two
cups
and
a
plate
there
was
no
fire
but
a
few
pieces
of
wood
lay
near
the
hearth
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
open
cupboard
remained
a
very
small
supply
of
coals
a
candle
made
fast
in
the
neck
of
a
bottle
was
the
source
of
light
on
the
floor
was
sitting
or
lying
an
animated
object
indescribable
bob
knew
it
for
candy
her
eyes
looked
up
at
him
apprehensively
want
to
stay
the
night
over
if
you
let
me
he
said
when
he
had
closed
the
door
got
to
hide
away
nobody
must
know
as
here
welcome
the
woman
replied
in
a
voice
which
was
horrible
to
hear
then
she
paid
no
more
attention
to
him
but
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hand
and
began
a
regular
moaning
as
if
she
suffered
some
dull
persistent
pain
bob
crept
up
to
the
wall
and
let
himself
sink
there
he
could
not
reflect
for
more
than
a
minute
or
two
continuously
his
brain
then
became
a
mere
confused
whirl
in
one
of
the
intervals
of
his
perfect
consciousness
he
asked
candy
if
stephen
would
come
here
she
did
not
heed
him
till
he
had
twice
repeated
the
question
and
then
she
started
and
looked
at
him
in
wild
fear
stephen
be
coming
yes
yes
i
should
wonder
she
seemed
to
fall
asleep
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken
her
head
dropped
heavily
on
the
boards
not
long
after
midnight
the
potman
made
his
appearance
as
always
on
returning
from
his
day
of
work
he
was
all
but
insensible
with
fatigue
entering
the
room
he
turned
his
white
face
with
an
expression
of
stupid
wonderment
to
the
corner
in
which
bob
lay
the
latter
raised
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
you
bob
hewett
want
to
stop
here
over
the
night
replied
the
other
speaking
with
difficulty
ca
go
home
there
something
up
pennyloaf
i
got
to
hide
away
and
i
feeling
bad
awful
bad
have
you
got
anything
to
drink
stephen
having
listened
with
a
face
of
a
somnambulist
went
to
the
and
looked
into
the
teapot
it
was
empty
can
go
to
the
tap
in
the
yard
he
said
could
get
so
far
oh
i
feel
bad
fetch
you
some
water
a
animal
this
poor
stephen
a
very
tolerable
human
being
had
he
had
he
would
not
abandon
his
wretched
mother
though
to
continue
living
with
her
meant
hunger
and
cold
and
yet
worse
evils
for
himself
his
life
was
supported
chiefly
on
the
three
pints
of
liquor
which
he
was
allowed
every
day
his
arms
and
legs
were
those
of
a
living
skeleton
his
poor
idiotic
face
was
made
yet
more
repulsive
by
disease
yet
you
could
have
seen
that
he
was
the
brother
of
pennyloaf
there
was
pennyloaf
submissive
look
in
his
eyes
and
his
voice
had
something
that
reminded
one
of
hers
coppers
after
you
he
whispered
stooping
down
to
bob
with
the
teacup
he
had
filled
with
water
bob
nodded
then
drained
the
cup
eagerly
get
knocked
down
by
a
cab
or
something
he
added
hit
me
just
here
i
may
feel
better
when
i
rested
a
bit
you
got
no
furniture
left
took
it
last
saturday
was
a
week
took
it
for
rent
i
thought
we
did
owe
nothing
but
mother
told
me
she
paid
when
she
had
i
got
leave
to
stop
when
i
showed
as
i
could
pay
in
future
but
they
would
trust
me
to
make
up
them
three
weeks
they
took
the
furniture
it
i
call
it
i
asked
my
guvnor
if
it
was
law
for
them
to
take
mother
an
he
said
yes
it
was
when
it
for
rent
they
can
take
everything
even
to
your
beddin
an
tools
yes
they
can
take
everything
how
foolish
of
stephen
candy
and
his
tribe
not
to
be
born
of
the
class
of
landlords
the
inconvenience
of
having
no
foothold
on
the
earth
surface
is
so
manifest
could
say
nothing
to
her
he
continued
nodding
towards
the
prostrate
woman
was
sorry
for
it
an
you
ca
ask
no
more
it
was
my
fault
for
trustin
her
with
the
money
to
pay
but
i
get
a
bit
careless
now
an
then
an
forgot
you
do
look
bad
bob
an
there
no
mistake
would
you
feel
better
if
i
lighted
a
bit
o
fire
i
feel
cold
i
was
hot
just
now
need
be
afraid
o
the
coals
mother
goes
round
the
streets
after
the
an
you
would
believe
what
a
lot
she
picks
up
some
days
you
see
we
neither
of
us
in
the
very
often
we
do
burn
much
he
lit
a
fire
and
bob
dragged
himself
near
to
it
in
the
meantime
the
quietness
of
the
house
was
suffering
a
disturbance
familiar
to
its
denizens
hope
you
remember
mr
hope
had
just
returned
from
an
evening
at
the
and
was
bent
on
sustaining
his
reputation
for
unmatched
vigour
of
language
he
was
quarrelling
with
his
wife
and
daughters
their
high
notes
of
vituperation
mingled
in
the
most
effective
way
with
his
manly
thunder
to
hear
hope
expressions
a
stranger
would
have
imagined
him
on
the
very
point
of
savagely
murdering
all
his
family
another
voice
became
audible
it
was
that
of
ned
higgs
who
had
opened
his
door
to
bellow
curses
at
the
disturbers
of
his
rest
be
wakin
mother
said
stephen
i
knew
they
would
candy
stirred
and
after
a
few
vain
efforts
to
raise
herself
started
up
suddenly
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
fire
which
was
just
beginning
to
blaze
and
uttered
a
dreadful
cry
a
shriek
of
mad
terror
god
groaned
her
son
hope
it
ai
goin
to
be
one
of
her
bad
nights
mother
mother
what
wrong
with
you
see
come
to
the
fire
an
warm
yourself
mother
she
repeated
the
cry
two
or
three
times
but
with
less
violence
then
as
though
exhausted
she
fell
face
downwards
her
arms
folded
about
her
head
the
moaning
which
bob
had
heard
earlier
in
the
evening
recommenced
happily
it
was
not
to
be
one
of
her
bad
nights
fits
of
the
horrors
only
came
upon
her
twice
before
morning
towards
one
stephen
had
sunk
into
a
sleep
which
scarcely
any
conceivable
uproar
could
have
broken
he
lay
with
his
head
on
his
right
arm
his
legs
stretched
out
at
full
length
his
breathing
was
light
bob
was
much
later
in
getting
rest
as
often
as
he
slumbered
for
an
instant
the
terrible
image
of
his
fear
rose
manifest
before
him
he
saw
himself
in
the
clutch
of
his
hunters
just
like
jack
bartley
and
woke
to
lie
quivering
must
not
that
be
the
end
of
it
sooner
or
later
might
he
not
as
well
give
himself
up
but
the
thought
of
punishment
such
as
his
crime
receives
was
unendurable
it
haunted
him
in
nightmare
when
sheer
exhaustion
had
at
length
weighed
down
his
eyelids
long
before
daybreak
he
was
conscious
again
tormented
with
thirst
and
his
head
aching
woefully
someone
had
risen
in
the
room
above
and
was
tramping
about
in
heavy
boots
the
noise
seemed
to
disturb
candy
she
cried
out
in
her
sleep
in
a
few
minutes
the
early
riser
came
forth
and
began
to
descend
the
stairs
he
was
going
to
his
work
a
little
while
and
in
the
court
below
a
voice
shouted
bill
another
worker
being
called
doubtless
at
seven
stephen
roused
himself
he
took
a
piece
of
soap
from
a
shelf
of
the
cupboard
threw
a
dirty
rag
over
his
arm
and
went
down
to
wash
at
the
tap
in
the
yard
only
on
returning
did
he
address
bob
any
better
think
so
but
i
very
bad
you
goin
to
stay
here
do
know
any
money
ninepence
could
you
get
me
something
to
drink
stephen
took
twopence
went
out
and
speedily
returned
with
a
large
mug
of
coffee
from
his
pocket
he
brought
forth
a
lump
of
cake
which
had
cost
a
halfpenny
this
he
thought
might
tempt
a
sick
appetite
his
own
breakfast
he
would
take
at
the
get
you
anything
else
you
want
he
said
knows
herself
generally
first
thing
in
the
morning
let
her
take
back
the
mug
i
had
to
leave
threepence
on
it
so
stephen
also
went
forth
to
his
labour
in
this
case
it
may
surely
be
said
the
curse
of
curses
at
this
hour
pennyloaf
bestirred
herself
after
a
night
of
weeping
last
evening
the
police
had
visited
her
room
and
had
searched
it
thoroughly
the
revelation
amazed
her
she
would
not
believe
the
charge
that
was
made
against
her
husband
she
became
angry
with
griffin
when
that
practical
woman
said
she
was
not
at
all
surprised
utterly
gone
was
her
resentment
of
bob
latest
cruelty
his
failure
to
return
home
seemed
to
prove
that
he
had
been
arrested
and
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
punishment
that
awaited
him
penal
servitude
remarked
griffin
frankly
or
ten
years
i
heard
of
gettin
sent
for
life
pennyloaf
would
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
this
befalling
her
husband
it
was
too
cruel
there
would
be
some
pity
some
mercy
she
had
a
confused
notion
of
witnesses
being
called
to
give
a
man
a
good
character
and
strengthened
herself
in
the
thought
of
what
she
would
say
under
such
circumstances
on
bob
behalf
been
a
good
she
kept
repeating
to
griffin
and
to
the
other
neighbours
who
crowded
to
indulge
their
curiosity
nobody
can
say
as
he
ai
been
a
good
it
a
lie
if
they
do
by
eight
she
was
at
the
with
fear
she
entered
the
ugly
doorway
and
approached
a
policeman
who
stood
in
the
when
she
had
made
her
inquiry
the
man
referred
her
to
the
inspector
she
was
asked
many
questions
but
to
her
own
received
no
definite
reply
she
had
better
look
in
again
the
next
morning
my
belief
they
ai
got
him
said
griffin
had
a
warnin
from
his
pals
pennyloaf
would
dearly
have
liked
to
communicate
with
jane
snowdon
but
shame
prevented
her
all
day
she
stood
by
the
house
door
looking
eagerly
now
this
way
now
that
with
an
unreasoning
hope
that
bob
might
show
himself
she
tried
to
believe
that
he
was
only
keeping
away
because
of
his
behaviour
to
her
the
night
before
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
laid
hand
upon
her
and
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
he
would
come
back
and
this
charge
against
him
would
be
proved
false
pennyloaf
could
not
distinguish
between
her
desire
that
something
might
happen
and
the
probability
of
its
doing
so
but
darkness
fell
upon
the
streets
and
her
watch
was
kept
in
rain
she
dreaded
the
thought
of
passing
another
night
in
uncertainty
long
ago
her
tears
had
dried
up
she
had
a
parched
throat
and
trembling
feverish
hands
between
seven
and
eight
she
went
to
griffin
and
begged
her
to
take
care
of
the
child
for
a
little
while
goin
to
see
if
i
can
hear
anything
about
him
somebody
may
know
where
he
is
and
first
of
all
she
directed
her
steps
to
shooter
gardens
it
was
very
unlikely
that
her
mother
could
be
of
any
use
but
she
would
seek
there
afterwards
she
must
go
to
farringdon
road
buildings
though
never
yet
had
she
presented
herself
to
bob
father
you
remember
that
the
gardens
had
an
offshoot
which
was
known
simply
as
the
court
in
this
blind
alley
there
stood
throughout
the
day
a
row
of
ovens
ten
or
a
dozen
of
them
chained
together
the
property
of
a
local
capitalist
who
let
them
severally
to
men
engaged
in
this
business
at
seven
of
an
evening
fires
were
wont
to
be
lighted
under
each
of
these
preparatory
to
their
being
wheeled
away
each
to
its
customary
now
the
lighting
of
fires
entails
the
creation
of
smoke
and
whilst
these
ten
or
twelve
ovens
were
getting
ready
to
bake
potatoes
the
court
was
in
a
condition
not
easily
described
a
single
lamp
existed
for
the
purpose
of
giving
light
to
the
alley
and
at
no
time
did
this
serve
much
more
than
to
make
darkness
visible
at
present
the
blind
man
would
have
fared
as
well
in
that
retreat
as
he
who
had
eyes
and
the
marvel
was
how
those
who
lived
there
escaped
suffocation
in
the
gardens
themselves
volumes
of
dense
smoke
every
now
and
then
came
driven
along
by
the
cold
gusts
the
air
had
a
stifling
smell
and
a
bitter
taste
pennyloaf
found
nothing
remarkable
in
this
phenomenon
it
is
hard
to
say
what
would
have
struck
her
as
worthy
of
indignant
comment
in
her
world
of
little
ease
but
near
the
entrance
to
the
court
dimly
discernible
amid
sagging
fumes
was
a
cluster
of
people
and
as
everything
of
that
kind
just
now
excited
her
apprehensions
she
drew
near
to
see
what
was
happening
the
gathering
was
around
mad
jack
he
looked
more
than
usually
wild
and
with
one
hand
raised
above
his
head
was
on
the
point
of
relating
a
vision
he
had
had
the
night
before
laugh
do
any
of
you
laugh
for
as
sure
as
i
live
it
was
an
angel
stood
in
the
room
and
spoke
to
me
there
was
a
light
such
as
none
of
you
ever
saw
and
the
angel
stood
in
the
midst
of
it
and
he
said
to
me
listen
whilst
i
reveal
to
you
the
truth
that
you
may
know
where
you
are
and
what
you
are
and
this
is
done
for
a
great
purpose
and
i
fell
down
on
my
knees
but
never
a
word
could
i
have
spoken
then
the
angel
said
you
are
passing
through
a
state
of
punishment
you
and
all
the
poor
among
whom
you
live
all
those
who
are
in
suffering
of
body
and
darkness
of
mind
were
once
rich
people
with
every
blessing
the
world
can
bestow
with
every
opportunity
of
happiness
in
yourselves
and
of
making
others
happy
because
you
made
an
ill
use
of
your
wealth
because
you
were
selfish
and
and
oppressive
and
sinful
in
every
kind
of
indulgence
therefore
after
death
you
received
the
reward
of
wickedness
this
life
you
are
now
leading
is
that
of
the
damned
this
place
to
which
you
are
confined
is
hell
there
is
no
escape
for
you
from
poor
you
shall
become
poorer
the
older
you
grow
the
lower
shall
you
sink
in
want
and
misery
at
the
end
there
is
waiting
for
you
one
and
all
a
death
in
abandonment
and
despair
this
is
hell
hell
hell
his
voice
had
risen
in
pitch
and
the
last
cry
was
so
terrifying
that
pennyloaf
fled
to
be
out
of
hearing
she
reached
the
house
to
which
her
visit
was
and
in
the
dark
passage
leaned
for
a
moment
against
the
wall
trembling
all
over
then
she
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
at
candy
door
she
knocked
gently
there
was
at
first
no
answer
but
when
she
had
knocked
again
a
strange
voice
that
she
did
not
recognise
asked
that
it
seemed
to
come
from
low
down
as
if
the
speaker
were
lying
on
the
floor
me
she
replied
again
trembling
she
knew
not
with
what
fear
hewett
pennyloaf

she
bent
down
listening
eagerly
that
speakin
you

strange
the
voice
was
again
different
very
feeble
a
thick
whisper
there
nobody
else
can
i
come
in
there
was
a
shuffling
sound
then
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
pennyloaf
entered
and
found
herself
in
darkness
she
shrank
back
there
is
it
you

stephen
some
one
touched
her
at
the
same
time
shutting

door

the
voice
whispered

bob
she
uttered
a
cry
stretching
out
her
hands
a
head

leaning
against

and
she
bent

against

the

slammed

key
and
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
of
alarm
there
the
downstairs

this
minute
there

the
and
there

talkin
to

he
replied
in
a
tone
of
despair
followed
pennyloaf
it
was
the
truth
she
had
been
watched
all
day
and
was
now
tracked
to
shooter
gardens
to
this
house
candy
struck
a
match
and
for
an
instant
illuminated
the
wretched
room
she
looked
at
the
two
and
they
at
length
saw
each
other
faces
then
the
little
flame
was
extinguished
and
a
red
spot
marked
the
place
where
the
remnant
of
the
match
lay
i
light
the
candle
the
woman
asked
in
a
whisper
neither
replied
for
there
was
a
heavy
foot
on
the
stairs
it
came
nearer
a
hand
tried
the
door
then
knocked
loudly
candy
cried
a
stranger
the
three
crouched
together
holding
their
breath
pennyloaf
pressed
her
husband
in
an
agonised
embrace
candy
you
wanted
on
business
open
the
door
if
you
open
we
shall
force
it

pennyloaf
whispered
in
her
mother
ear
sha
come
in
do
stir
you
going
to
open
the
door
it
was
a
different
speaker
brief
stern
ten
seconds
and
there
came
a
tremendous
crash
the
crazy
door
the
whole
wall
quivered
and
cracked
and
groaned
the
crash
was
repeated
and
effectually
with
a
sound
of
ripping
wood
the
door
flew
open
and
a
light
streamed
into
the
room
useless
pennyloaf
useless
that
fierce
kick
making
ruin
of
your
rotten
barrier
is
dealt
with
the
whole
force
of
law
of
society
you
might
as
well
think
of
resisting
death
when
your
hour
shall
come
he
is
observed
one
of
the
men
calmly
what
up
ca
take
him
away
pennyloaf
cried
falling
down
again
by
bob
and
clinging
to
him
ill
you
ca
take
him
like
this
is
he
then
the
sooner
our
doctor
sees
him
the
better
up
you
get
my
man
but
there
are
some
things
that
even
law
and
society
can
not
command
bob
lay
insensible
shamming
well
no
it
seemed
not
send
for
a
stretcher
quickly
no
great
delay
pennyloaf
sat
in
mute
anguish
bob
head
on
her
lap
on
the
staircase
was
a
crowd
of
people
talking
shouting
whistling
presently
they
were
cleared
away
by
a
new
arrival
of
officials
room
for
law
and
society
the
stretcher
arrived
the
senseless
body
was
carried
down
and
laid
upon
it
a
policeman
at
each
end
and
close
clinging
pennyloaf
above
the
noise
of
the
crowd
rose
a
shrill
wild
voice
chanting
ye
works
of
the
lord
bless
ye
the
lord
praise
him
and
magnify
him
for
ever
chapter
xxxviii
joseph
transacts
much
business
amid
the
anguish
of
heart
and
nerve
which
she
had
to
endure
whilst
her
grandfather
lay
dead
in
the
house
jane
found
and
clung
to
one
thought
of
consolation
he
had
not
closed
his
eyes
in
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
the
end
might
have
come
on
that
miserable
day
when
her
weakness
threatened
the
defeat
of
all
his
hopes
and
how
could
she
then
have
borne
it
true
or
not
it
would
have
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
killed
him
she
could
not
have
looked
on
his
face
and
all
the
rest
of
her
life
would
have
been
remorsefully
shadowed
now
the
dead
features
were
unreproachful
nay
when
she
overcame
her
childish
tremors
and
gazed
calmly
it
was
easy
to
imagine
that
he
smiled
death
itself
had
come
without
pain
an
old
man
weary
after
his
long
journeys
after
his
many
griefs
and
the
noble
striving
of
his
thought
surely
he
rested
well
during
the
last
days
he
had
been
more
affectionate
with
her
than
was
his
habit
she
remembered
it
with
gratitude
words
of
endearment
seldom
came
to
his
lips
but
since
the
reconciliation
he
had
more
than
once
spoken
tenderly
doubtless
he
was
anxious
to
assure
her
that
she
had
again
all
his
confidence
strengthening
herself
in
that
reflection
she
strove
to
put
everything
out
of
her
mind
save
the
duty
which
must
henceforth
direct
her
happily
there
could
be
no
more
strife
with
the
promptings
of
her
weaker
self
circumstances
left
but
one
path
open
before
her
and
that
however
difficult
the
one
she
desired
to
tread
henceforth
memory
must
dwell
on
one
thing
only
in
the
past
her
rescue
by
michael
snowdon
her
nurture
under
his
care
though
he
could
no
longer
speak
the
recollection
of
his
words
must
be
her
unfailing
impulse
in
her
his
spirit
must
survive
his
benevolence
still
be
operative
at
her
wish
her
father
acquainted
sidney
kirkwood
with
what
had
happened
sidney
did
not
visit
her
but
he
wrote
a
letter
which
having
read
it
many
times
she
put
carefully
away
to
be
a
resource
if
ever
her
heart
failed
percival
came
to
the
house
on
monday
in
the
company
of
joseph
snowdon
he
was
sympathetic
but
made
no
direct
reference
to
her
position
either
now
or
in
the
future
whilst
he
and
her
father
transacted
matters
of
business
in
the
upper
rooms
jane
remained
downstairs
with
byass
before
quitting
the
house
he
asked
her
if
she
had
had
any
communication
with
miss
lant
yet
ought
to
write
and
tell
her
replied
jane
will
do
so
for
you
said
the
lawyer
kindly
and
on
taking
leave
he
held
her
hand
for
a
moment
looking
compassionately
into
her
pale
face
on
thursday
morning
there
arrived
a
letter
from
miss
lant
who
happened
to
be
out
of
town
and
grieved
that
she
could
not
return
in
time
for
the
funeral
which
would
be
that
day
there
was
nothing
about
the
future
excepting
a
promise
that
the
writer
would
come
very
shortly
michael
was
buried
at
abney
park
cemetery
no
ray
of
sunlight
fell
upon
his
open
grave
but
the
weather
was
mild
and
among
the
budded
trees
passed
a
breath
which
was
the
promise
of
spring
joseph
snowdon
and
the
byasses
were
jane
only
companions
in
the
but
at
the
cemetery
they
were
joined
by
sidney
kirkwood
jane
saw
him
and
felt
the
pressure
of
his
hand
but
she
could
neither
speak
nor
understand
anything
that
was
said
to
her
on
friday
morning
before
she
had
made
a
show
of
eating
the
breakfast
bessie
byass
prepared
for
her
a
visitor
arrived
says
her
name
griffin
said
bessie
she
has
something
very
important
to
tell
you
do
you
feel
you
can
see
her
griffin
oh
i
remember
she
lives
in
the
same
house
as
pennyloaf
yes
let
her
come
in
the
woman
was
introduced
to
the
byasses
parlour
which
bessie
thought
more
cheerful
for
jane
just
now
than
the
room
upstairs
you
heard
anything
of
what
been
goin
on
with
the
hewetts
miss
she
began
i
have
been
able
to
go
out
this
week
i
had
trouble
at
home
see
at
once
as
you
was
in
in
mournin
miss
an
i
sorry
for
it
you
lookin
nothing
like
yourself
i
do
know
whether
it
right
to
upset
you
with
other
people
bothers
but
there
that
poor
hewett
in
such
a
state
and
i
said
as
i
run
round
she
seems
to
think
there
nobody
else
can
come
to
her
help
as
you
can
i
always
knew
as
something
o
this
kind
be
what
is
it
what
has
happened
jane
felt
her
energies
revive
at
this
appeal
for
help
it
was
the
best
thing
that
could
have
befallen
now
that
she
was
wearily
despondent
after
yesterday
suffering
dead
miss
that
ai
the
worst
of
it
he
was
took
by
the
perlice
last
night
which
they
wanted
him
for
makin
bad
money
i
always
have
said
as
a
cruel
thing
that
how
can
you
tell
who
gets
the
bad
coin
it
may
be
some
pore
person
as
ca
afford
to
lose
not
a
but
that
what
he
been
up
to
an
this
long
time
as
it
appears
in
her
dialect
which
requires
so
many
words
for
the
narration
of
a
simple
story
griffin
told
what
she
knew
concerning
bob
accident
and
capture
his
death
had
taken
place
early
this
morning
and
pennyloaf
was
all
but
crazy
with
grief
to
jane
these
things
sounded
so
extraordinary
that
for
some
time
she
could
scarcely
put
a
question
but
sat
in
dismay
listening
to
the
woman
prolix
description
of
all
that
had
come
to
pass
since
wednesday
evening
at
length
she
called
for
byass
for
whose
benefit
the
story
was
repeated
sure
you
ought
to
go
there
was
bessie
opinion
quite
enough
trouble
of
your
own
my
dear
that
just
what
i
was
mum
assented
griffin
who
had
won
bessie
highest
opinion
by
her
free
use
of
respectful
forms
of
address
never
saw
no
one
look
iller
as
you
may
say
than
the
young
lady
yes
i
will
go
said
jane
rising
trouble
nothing
to
hers
oh
i
shall
go
at
once
remember
your
father
coming
at
nine
urged
bessie
he
said
he
wanted
to
speak
to
you
particular
is
the
time
now
a
quarter
to
nine
i
can
be
back
by
i
think
and
then
i
can
go
again
father
would
mind
waiting
a
few
minutes
i
must
go
at
once
mrs
byass
she
would
hear
no
objection
and
speedily
left
the
house
in
griffin
company
at
nine
punctually
snowdon
double
knock
sounded
at
the
door
joseph
looked
more
respectable
than
ever
in
his
black
and
silk
hat
with
the
deep
band
his
bow
to
byass
was
solemn
but
gallant
he
pressed
her
fingers
like
a
clergyman
paying
a
visit
of
consolation
and
in
a
subdued
voice
made
affectionate
inquiry
after
his
daughter
has
slept
i
hope
poor
child
bessie
took
him
into
the
and
explained
jane
absence
good
girl
a
good
girl
he
remarked
after
listening
with
elevated
brows
she
must
be
careful
of
her
health
my
visit
this
morning
is
on
matters
of
business
no
doubt
she
will
tell
you
the
principal
points
of
our
conversation
afterwards
an
excellent
friend
you
have
been
to
her
mrs
byass
excellent
sure
i
do
see
how
anyone
could
help
liking
her
said
bessie
inwardly
delighted
with
the
expectation
of
hearing
at
length
what
jane
circumstances
really
were
so
good
a
friend
pursued
joseph
i
afraid
it
would
distress
her
if
she
could
no
longer
live
with
you
and
the
fact
is
he
bent
forward
and
smiled
sadly
sure
i
may
speak
freely
to
you
byass
but
the
fact
is
that
i
very
doubtful
indeed
whether
she
could
be
happy
if
she
lived
with
snowdon
i
suppose
there
always
more
or
less
difficulty
where
are
concerned
and
in
this
case
well
i
fear
the
incompatibility
would
be
too
great
to
be
sure
it
places
me
in
a
difficult
position
jane
very
young
very
young
only
just
turned
seventeen
poor
child
out
of
the
question
for
her
to
live
with
strangers
i
had
some
hopes
i
wonder
whether
i
ought
to
speak
of
it
you
know
mr
kirkwood
indeed
i
ca
tell
you
how
surprised
i
was
snowdon
and
there
seems
to
be
such
a
mystery
about
it
too
bessie
positively
glowed
with
delight
in
such
confidential
talk
it
was
her
dread
that
jane
arrival
might
put
an
end
to
it
before
everything
was
revealed
mystery
you
may
well
say
byass
i
think
highly
of
kirkwood
very
highly
but
really
in
this
affair
it
almost
too
painful
to
talk
about
to
bessie
blushed
as
becomes
the
englishwoman
of
mature
years
when
she
is
gracefully
supposed
to
be
ignorant
of
all
it
most
behoves
her
to
know
well
he
is
on
the
point
of
marrying
a
young
person
with
whom
i
should
certainly
not
like
my
daughter
to
associate
fortunately
there
is
little
chance
of
that
you
were
never
acquainted
with
miss
hewett
yes
a
long
time
ago
well
we
must
be
charitable
you
know
that
she
is
dreadfully
disfigured
jane
did
say
a
word
about
that
she
only
told
me
that
kirkwood
was
going
to
marry
her
and
i
did
like
to
ask
too
many
questions
i
had
even
heard
as
she
was
at
home
joseph
related
to
her
the
whole
story
whilst
bessie
fidgeted
with
satisfaction
thought
he
added
you
could
perhaps
throw
some
light
on
the
mystery
we
can
only
suppose
that
kirkwood
has
acted
from
the
highest
motives
but
i
really
think
well
well
we
wo
talk
of
it
any
more
i
was
led
to
this
subject
from
speaking
of
this
poor
girl
position
i
wonder
whether
it
will
be
possible
for
her
to
continue
to
live
in
your
friendly
care
mrs
byass
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
mr
snowdon
how
kind
that
is
of
you
of
course
she
would
want
more
than
two
rooms
course
not
joseph
was
going
further
into
details
when
a
was
heard
opening
the
front
door
jane
entered
hurriedly
the
rapid
walk
had
brought
colour
to
her
check
in
her
simple
mourning
attire
she
looked
very
interesting
very
sweet
and
girlish
she
had
been
shedding
tears
and
it
was
with
unsteady
voice
that
she
excused
herself
for
keeping
her
father
waiting
mind
that
my
dear
replied
joseph
as
he
kissed
her
cheek
have
been
doing
good
unselfish
as
always
sit
down
and
rest
you
must
be
careful
not
to
yourself
bessie
busied
herself
affectionately
in
removing
jane
hat
and
jacket
then
withdrew
that
father
and
child
might
converse
in
private
joseph
looked
at
his
daughter
his
praise
of
her
was
not
all
mere
affectation
of
sentiment
he
had
spoken
truly
when
he
said
to
scawthorne
that
but
for
clem
he
would
ask
nothing
better
than
to
settle
down
with
this
gentle
girl
for
his
companion
selfishness
for
the
most
part
but
implying
appreciation
of
her
qualities
she
did
not
love
him
but
he
was
sincere
enough
with
himself
to
admit
that
this
was
perfectly
natural
had
circumstances
permitted
he
would
have
tried
hard
to
win
some
affection
from
her
poor
little
girl
how
would
it
affect
her
when
she
heard
what
he
was
going
to
say
he
felt
angry
with
kirkwood
yes
truly
indignant
men
are
capable
of
greater
inconsistencies
than
this
she
would
not
have
cared
much
about
the
money
had
kirkwood
married
her
of
that
he
felt
sure
she
had
lost
her
lover
now
he
was
going
to
deprive
her
of
her
inheritance
cruel
yes
but
he
really
felt
so
to
her
so
determined
to
make
her
a
comfortable
provision
for
the
future
and
had
the
money
been
hers
impossible
to
have
regarded
her
thus
joseph
was
thankful
to
the
chance
which
in
making
him
wealthy
had
also
enabled
him
to
nourish
such
virtuous
feeling
how
should
he
begin
he
had
a
bright
idea
an
idea
worthy
of
him
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
brought
out
then
humble
friend
in
a
sad
condition
i
afraid
jane
is
father
you
give
her
this
every
little
helps
you
know
jane
received
the
coin
and
murmured
thanks
for
his
kindness
but
could
not
help
betraying
some
surprise
joseph
was
on
the
watch
for
this
it
gave
him
his
exquisite
opportunity
surprised
at
me
offering
you
money
jane
i
believe
your
poor
grandfather
led
you
to
suppose
that
that
his
will
was
made
almost
entirely
in
your
favour
jane
could
not
reply
she
searched
his
face
it
disappoint
you
very
much
my
child
he
continued
sympathetically
it
turned
out
that
he
had
either
altered
his
mind
or
by
some
accident
had
neglected
to
make
his
will
i
speak
as
your
father
janey
and
i
think
i
have
some
knowledge
of
your
character
i
think
i
know
that
you
are
as
free
from
avarice
as
anyone
could
be
was
it
true
he
began
to
ask
himself
why
then
had
her
countenance
fallen
why
did
such
a
look
of
deep
distress
pass
over
it
fact
is
janey
he
continued
hardening
himself
a
little
as
he
noted
her
expression
grandfather
left
no
will
the
result
the
legal
result
of
that
is
that
all
his
property
becomes
ah
mine
he
in
fact
he
destroyed
his
will
a
very
short
time
comparatively
speaking
before
he
died
and
he
neglected
to
make
another
unfortunately
you
see
under
these
circumstances
we
ca
be
sure
what
his
wish
was
she
was
deadly
pale
there
was
anguish
in
the
look
with
which
she
regarded
her
father
very
sorry
it
pains
you
so
my
dear
joseph
remarked
still
more
coldly
did
think
you
were
so
taken
up
with
the
thought
of
money
really
jane
a
young
girl
at
your
time
of
life
father
how
can
you
think
that
it
was
to
be
for
myself
i
thought
you
knew
indeed
you
did
know
you
looked
so
very
strange
my
dear
evidently
you
felt
i
feel
it
i
do
feel
it
but
because
it
means
that
grandfather
could
get
back
his
trust
in
me
oh
it
is
too
hard
when
did
he
destroy
his
will
when
father
days
before
his
death
that
was
when
it
happened
you
never
heard
he
promised
to
tell
nobody
i
disappointed
him
i
showed
myself
very
foolish
and
weak
in
in
something
that
happened
then
i
made
grandfather
think
that
i
was
too
selfish
to
live
as
he
hoped
that
i
could
do
what
undertaken
that
was
why
he
destroyed
his
will
and
i
thought
he
had
forgiven
me
i
thought
he
trusted
me
again
o
grandfather
snowdon
was
astonished
at
the
explanation
of
his
own
good
luck
and
yet
more
at
jane
display
of
feeling
so
quiet
so
reserved
as
he
had
always
known
her
she
seemed
to
have
become
another
person
for
some
moments
he
could
only
gaze
at
her
in
wonder
never
yet
had
he
heard
never
again
would
he
hear
the
utterance
of
an
emotion
so
profound
and
so
noble
try
and
control
yourself
my
dear
let
talk
it
over
jane
feel
as
if
it
would
break
my
heart
i
thought
i
had
that
one
thing
to
comfort
me
it
like
losing
him
again
losing
his
confidence
to
think
i
should
have
disappointed
him
in
just
what
he
hoped
more
than
anything
you
mistaken
joseph
exclaimed
a
generous
feeling
for
once
getting
the
better
of
prudence
my
dear
and
i
explain
to
you
i
had
finished
when
you
interrupted
me
she
clasped
her
hands
upon
her
lap
and
gazed
at
him
in
eager
appeal
he
say
anything
to
you
father
and
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
if
he
trusted
you
he
have
said
something
what
more
on
the
very
day
before
his
death
he
wrote
a
letter
to
percival
to
say
that
he
wanted
to
make
his
will
again
he
was
going
to
do
it
on
the
monday
there
now
it
was
only
an
accident
he
had
time
to
do
what
he
wished
this
was
making
a
concession
which
he
had
expressly
resolved
to
guard
against
but
joseph
designs
ripened
lost
their
crudity
as
he
saw
more
and
more
of
his
daughter
disposition
he
was
again
grateful
to
her
she
had
made
things
smoother
than
he
could
have
hoped
really
think
father
that
he
would
have
made
the
same
will
as
before
a
doubt
about
it
my
love
not
a
doubt
of
it
in
fact
now
let
me
set
your
poor
little
mind
at
rest
only
two
days
before
his
death
when
was
it
i
saw
him
last
friday
thursday
he
said
to
me
that
he
had
a
higher
opinion
of
you
than
ever
there
now
jane
she
would
have
deemed
it
impossible
for
anyone
to
utter
less
than
truth
in
such
connection
as
this
her
eyes
gleamed
with
joy
you
understand
just
how
it
was
jane
what
we
have
to
talk
about
now
is
how
we
can
arrange
things
so
as
to
carry
out
your
wish
i
am
your
guardian
my
dear
now
i
sure
you
would
desire
to
have
command
of
large
sums
of
money
before
you
are
just
so
your
grandfather
did
intend
it
well
first
let
me
ask
you
this
question
would
you
rather
live
with
with
your
stepmother
or
with
your
excellent
friend
byass
i
see
what
your
answer
is
and
i
approve
it
i
fully
approve
it
now
suppose
we
arrange
that
you
are
to
have
an
allowance
of
two
pounds
a
week
it
is
just
possible
just
possible
that
i
may
have
to
go
abroad
on
business
before
long
in
that
case
the
payment
would
be
made
to
you
through
an
agent
do
you
feel
it
would
be
satisfactory
jane
was
thinking
how
much
of
this
sum
could
be
saved
to
give
away
seems
little
but
you
see
no
father
it
is
quite
enough
we
understand
each
other
of
course
this
is
a
temporary
arrangement
i
must
have
time
to
think
over
grandfather
ideas
why
you
are
a
mere
child
yet
janey
seventeen
a
mere
child
my
dear
forgetting
the
decorum
imposed
by
his
costume
joseph
became
all
but
gay
so
delightfully
were
things
arranging
themselves
a
hundred
a
year
he
could
very
well
afford
just
to
keep
his
conscience
at
ease
and
for
jane
it
would
be
wealth
excellent
byass
was
as
good
a
guardian
as
could
anywhere
be
found
and
jane
discretion
forbade
any
fear
on
her
account
when
business
should
take
him
away
now
we
talked
quite
long
enough
do
think
for
a
moment
that
you
had
your
grandfather
confidence
my
dear
it
would
be
distressing
yourself
wholly
without
reason
wholly
be
a
good
girl
why
there
you
see
i
speak
to
you
as
if
you
were
a
child
and
so
you
are
poor
little
girl
far
too
young
to
have
worldly
troubles
no
no
i
must
relieve
you
of
all
that
until
well
now
i
leave
you
for
my
dear
he
kissed
her
cheek
but
jane
sobbing
a
little
put
her
pure
lips
to
his
joseph
looked
about
him
for
an
instant
as
if
he
had
forgotten
something
then
departed
with
what
seemed
unnecessary
haste
jane
and
byass
had
a
long
talk
before
mystery
was
at
an
end
between
them
now
they
talked
much
of
the
past
more
of
the
future
at
two
jane
received
a
visit
from
miss
lant
this
lady
was
already
apprised
by
her
friend
percival
of
all
that
had
come
to
pass
she
was
prepared
to
exercise
much
discretion
but
jane
soon
showed
her
that
this
was
needless
the
subject
of
pressing
importance
to
the
latter
was
pennyloaf
disastrous
circumstances
unable
to
do
all
she
wished
jane
was
much
relieved
when
her
charitable
friend
proposed
to
set
off
to
merlin
place
forthwith
and
ascertain
how
help
could
most
effectually
be
given
yes
it
was
good
to
be
constrained
to
think
of
another
sorrows
there
passed
a
fortnight
during
which
jane
spent
some
hours
each
day
with
pennyloaf
by
the
kindness
of
fate
only
one
of
bob
children
survived
him
but
it
was
just
this
luckless
infant
whose
existence
made
pennyloaf
position
so
difficult
alone
she
could
have
gone
back
to
her
or
some
less
miserable
slavery
might
have
been
discovered
but
pennyloaf
dreaded
leaving
her
child
each
day
in
the
care
of
strangers
being
only
too
well
aware
what
that
meant
candy
was
of
course
worse
than
useless
stephen
the
potman
had
more
than
his
work
set
in
looking
after
her
whilst
miss
lant
and
jane
were
straining
their
wits
on
the
hardest
of
all
problems
to
find
a
means
of
livelihood
for
one
whom
society
pronounced
utterly
superfluous
pennyloaf
most
unexpectedly
solved
the
question
by
her
own
effort
somewhere
near
the
meat
market
one
night
she
encountered
an
acquaintance
a
woman
of
not
much
more
than
her
own
age
who
had
recently
become
a
widow
and
was
supporting
herself
as
well
as
four
little
ones
by
keeping
a
stall
at
which
she
sold
children
secondhand
clothing
her
difficulty
was
to
dispose
of
her
children
whilst
she
was
doing
business
at
night
pennyloaf
explained
her
own
position
and
with
the
result
that
her
acquaintance
by
name
todd
proposed
a
partnership
why
should
they
share
a
room
work
together
with
the
needle
in
patching
and
making
and
by
pennyloaf
staying
at
home
each
evening
keep
the
tribe
of
youngsters
out
of
danger
this
project
was
carried
out
the
two
brought
their
furniture
together
into
a
garret
and
it
seemed
probable
that
they
would
succeed
in
keeping
themselves
alive
but
before
this
settlement
was
effected
jane
own
prospects
had
undergone
a
change
of
some
importance
for
a
fortnight
nothing
was
heard
of
joseph
snowdon
in
hanover
street
then
there
came
a
letter
from
him
it
bore
a
liverpool
postmark
but
was
headed
with
no
address
joseph
wrote
that
the
business
to
which
he
had
alluded
was
already
summoning
him
from
england
he
regretted
that
there
had
not
even
been
time
for
him
to
say
farewell
to
his
daughter
however
he
would
write
to
her
occasionally
during
his
absence
and
hoped
to
hear
from
her
the
allowance
of
two
pounds
a
week
would
be
duly
paid
by
an
agent
and
on
receiving
it
each
saturday
she
was
to
forward
an
acknowledgment
to
jones
at
certain
in
the
city
let
her
in
the
meantime
be
a
good
girl
remain
with
her
excellent
friend
byass
and
repose
absolute
confidence
in
her
affectionate
father
that
same
morning
there
came
also
a
letter
from
liverpool
to
joseph
snowdon
a
letter
which
ran
thus
old
girl
i
regret
very
much
that
affairs
of
pressing
importance
call
me
away
from
my
happy
home
it
is
especially
distressing
that
this
occurs
just
at
the
time
when
we
were
on
the
point
of
taking
our
house
in
which
we
hoped
to
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
bliss
alas
that
is
not
to
be
do
not
repine
and
do
not
break
the
furniture
in
the
lodgings
as
your
means
will
henceforth
be
limited
i
fear
you
will
remember
that
i
was
in
your
debt
with
reference
to
a
little
affair
which
happened
in
clerkenwell
close
not
such
a
long
time
ago
please
accept
this
intimation
as
payment
in
full
when
i
am
established
in
the
country
to
which
business
summons
me
i
shall
of
course
send
for
you
immediately
but
it
may
happen
that
some
little
time
will
intervene
before
i
am
able
to
take
that
delightful
step
in
the
meanwhile
your
mother
will
supply
you
with
all
the
money
you
need
she
has
full
authority
from
me
to
do
so
all
blessings
upon
you
and
may
you
be
with
tears
i
sign
myself
husband
joseph
absence
through
the
night
had
all
but
prepared
clem
for
something
of
this
kind
yet
he
had
managed
things
so
well
that
up
to
the
time
of
his
departure
she
had
not
been
able
to
remark
a
single
suspicious
circumstance
unless
indeed
it
were
the
joyous
affectionateness
with
which
he
continued
to
behave
she
herself
had
been
passing
through
a
time
of
excitement
and
even
of
suffering
when
she
learned
from
the
newspaper
what
fate
had
befallen
bob
hewett
it
was
as
though
someone
had
dealt
her
a
blow
in
her
fierce
animal
way
she
was
attached
to
bob
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
knew
a
genuine
grief
the
event
seemed
at
first
impossible
she
sped
hither
and
thither
making
inquiries
and
raged
in
her
heart
against
everyone
who
confirmed
the
newspaper
report
combined
with
the
pain
of
loss
was
her
disappointment
at
the
frustration
of
the
scheme
bob
had
undertaken
in
concert
with
her
brooding
on
her
deadly
purpose
she
had
come
to
regard
it
as
a
certain
thing
that
before
long
her
husband
would
be
killed
the
details
were
arranged
all
her
cunning
had
gone
to
the
contrivance
of
a
plot
for
disguising
the
facts
of
his
murder
savagely
she
had
exulted
in
the
prospect
not
only
of
getting
rid
of
him
but
of
being
revenged
for
her
old
humiliation
a
thousand
times
she
imagined
herself
in
bob
raising
the
weapon
striking
the
murderous
blow
rifling
the
man
pockets
to
mislead
those
who
found
his
body
and
had
laughed
to
herself
triumphantly
joseph
out
of
the
way
the
next
thing
was
to
remove
pennyloaf
oh
that
would
easily
have
been
contrived
then
she
and
bob
would
have
been
married
very
long
since
clem
had
shed
tears
but
she
did
so
this
day
when
there
was
no
longer
a
possibility
of
doubting
that
bob
was
dead
she
shut
herself
in
her
room
and
moaned
like
a
wild
beast
in
pain
joseph
could
not
but
observe
when
he
came
home
that
she
was
suffering
in
some
extraordinary
way
when
he
spoke
jestingly
about
it
she
all
but
rushed
upon
him
with
her
fists
and
in
the
same
moment
she
determined
that
he
should
not
escape
even
if
she
had
to
murder
him
with
her
own
hands
from
that
day
her
constant
occupation
was
searching
the
newspapers
to
get
hints
about
poisons
doubtless
it
was
as
well
for
joseph
to
be
speedy
in
his
preparations
for
departure
she
was
present
in
the
when
jack
bartley
came
forward
to
be
dealt
with
against
him
she
stored
up
hatred
and
the
resolve
of
vengeance
if
it
were
years
before
she
had
the
opportunity
jack
should
in
the
end
pay
for
what
he
had
done
and
now
joseph
had
played
her
the
trick
she
anticipated
he
had
saved
himself
out
of
her
clutches
and
had
carried
off
all
his
money
with
him
she
knew
well
enough
what
was
meant
by
his
saying
that
her
mother
would
supply
what
she
needed
very
likely
that
he
had
made
any
such
arrangement
you
should
have
heard
the
sterling
vernacular
in
which
clem
gave
utterance
to
her
feelings
as
soon
as
she
had
deciphered
the
mocking
letter
without
a
minute
delay
she
dressed
and
left
the
house
having
a
few
shillings
in
her
pocket
she
took
a
cab
at
king
cross
and
bade
the
driver
drive
his
hardest
to
clerkenwell
close
up
pentonville
hill
panted
the
bony
horse
clem
swearing
all
the
time
because
it
could
go
no
quicker
but
the
top
was
reached
she
shouted
to
the
man
to
whip
whip
by
the
time
they
pulled
up
at
peckover
house
clem
herself
perspired
as
profusely
as
the
animal
peckover
was
at
breakfast
alone
that
will

read
that
roared
clem
rushing
upon
her
and
dashing
the
letter
in
her
face

her
mother
starting
up
in
anger

with
you
now

drew
away
from
the

and

jeering
laughter

command
of
her

of
action

half
believed
too
that

be
of

legal
efficacy

shouted

before

comes
to
that
the
wrangle
continued
for
some
time
longer
then
clem
bethought
herself
of
another
person
with
whom
she
must
have
the
satisfaction
of
speaking
her
mind
on
the
impulse
she
rushed
away
out
of
clerkenwell
close
up
john
street
road
across
city
road
down
to
hanover
street
literally
running
for
most
of

jane

herself
on
the

something
to

miss
jane

of
a
sudden
possessed
with
terror
the
old
terror
with
which
clem
had
inspired
her
years
ago
she
shrank
back
but
bessie
byass
was
by
no
means
disposed
to
allow
this
kind
of
thing
to
go
on
in
her
house
snowdon
she
exclaimed

byass

at
each
other
in
dismay
the
letter
that
had
come
this
morning
enabled
them
to
guess
the
meaning
of
clem
fury
the
latter
interpreted
their
looks
as
an
admission
that
jane

was
a
victim
she
laughed
aloud

by

this
minute
the
idea
clem
had
said
her
say
however
and
with
a
few
more
volleys
of
atrocious
language
was
content
to
retire
having
slammed
the
door
upon
her
bessie
cried
in
a
trembling
voice
if

been
here
my

given

something
for

a
creature

left
loose
oh
if
sam
had
been
here
jane
had
sat
down
on
the
stairs
her
face
was
hidden
in
her
hands
that
brutal
voice
had
carried
her
back
to
her
wretched
childhood
everything
about
her
in
the
present
was
unreal
in
comparison
with
the
terrors
the
hardships
the
humiliations
revived
by
memory
as
she
sat
at
this
moment
so
had
she
sat
many
a
time
on
the
at
peckover
so
powerfully
was
her
imagination
affected
that
she
had
a
feeling
as
if
her
hands
were
grimy
from
toil
as
if
her
limbs
ached
oh
that
dreadful
voice
was
she
never
never
to
escape
beyond
hearing
of
it
my
dear
come
into
the

you
what

the
meaning

not
far
to

jane
understood
everything
yes
even
her
father
hypocrisies
she
listened
for
a
few
minutes
to
her
friend
indignant
exclamations
then
looked
up
her
resolve
taken
byass
i
shall
take
no
more
money
i
shall
go
to
work
again
and
earn
my
living

ever
since

take
the
money
whether
it
true
or

she
said
i

consented
to
live
in
this
way

but
sobbed

vexation

it
and
i
shall
never
alter
my
mind
i
shall
send

the
money
and
write
to
the
man
that
he
need
send
any
more
however
often
it
comes
i
shall
always
return
it
i
could
i
could
live
on
that
money
never
ask
me
to
mrs
byass
practical
bessie
had
already
begun
to
ask
herself
what
arrangement
jane
proposed
to
make
about
lodgings
she
was
no
peckover
but
neither
did
circumstances
allow
her
to
disregard
the
question
of
rent
it
cut
her
to
the
heart
to
think
of
refusing
an
income
of
two
pounds
per
week
jane
too
saw
all
the
requirements
of
the
case
byass
will
you
let
me
have
one
room
my
old
room
upstairs
i
have
been
very
happy
there
and
i
should
like
to
stay
if
i
can
you
know
what
i
can
earn
can
you
afford
to
let
me
live
there
i
do
my
utmost
to
help
you
in
the
house
i
be
as
good
as
a
servant
if
you
ca
keep
sarah
i
should
so
like
to
stay
with
you
just
let
me
hear
you
talk
about
leaving
that
all
wait
till
i
talked
it
over
with
sam
jane
went
upstairs
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
the
house
was
very
quiet
not
whitehead
there
were
other
places
where
work
might
be
found
and
before
many
days
she
had
found
it
happily
there
were
no
luxuries
to
be
laid
aside
her
ordinary
dress
was
not
too
good
for
the
workroom
she
had
no
habits
of
idleness
to
overcome
and
an
hour
at
the
table
made
her
as
expert
with
her
fingers
as
ever
returning
from
the
first
day
work
she
sat
in
her
room
the
little
room
which
used
to
be
hers
to
rest
and
think
for
a
moment
before
going
down
to
bessie
and
her
thought
was
too
is
just
coming
home
from
work
why
should
my
life
be
easier
than

the

of

that

entered
by
a
little
iron
gate
which
grinds
as
you
push
it
and
at
no
time
would
latch
the
also
grinds
on
the
sill
it
can
only
be
opened
by
force
and
quivers
in
a
way
that
shows
how
unsubstantially
it
is
made
as
you
set
foot
in
the
pinched
passage
the
sound
of
your
tread
proves
the
whole
fabric
a
thing
of
lath
and
sand
the
ceilings
the
walls
confess
themselves
neither
nor
whatever
you
touch
is
at
once
found
to
be
sham
in
the
kitchen
of
one
of
these
houses
at
two
on
a
saturday
afternoon
in
september
three
young
people
were
sitting
down
to
the
a
girl
of
nearly
fourteen
her
sister
a
year
younger
and
their
brother
not
yet
eleven
all
were
decently
dressed
but
very
poorly
a
glance
at
them
and
you
knew
that
in
this
house
there
was
little
money
to
spend
on
superfluities
the
same
impression
was
produced
by
the
appointments
of
the
kitchen
which
was
disorderly
too
and
spoke
neglect
of
the
as
for
the
table
it
was
ill
laid
and
worse
supplied
the
meal
was
to
consist
of
the
of
a
shoulder
of
mutton
some
villainously
cooked
potatoes
and
bread
i
ca
eat
this
rot
again
cried
the
boy
making
a
dig
with
his
fork
at
the
scarcely
clad
piece
of
bone
shall
have
bread
and
cheese
lug
the
cheese
out
annie
you
wo
replied
the
elder
girl
in
a
disagreeable
voice
eat
this
or
go
without
she
had
an
unpleasing
appearance
her
face
was
very
thin
her
lips
pinched
sourly
together
her
eyes
furtive
hungry
malevolent
her
movements
were
awkward
and
impatient
and
a
morbid
nervousness
kept
her
constantly
starting
with
a
stealthy
look
here
or
there
shall
have
the
cheese
if
i
like
shouted
the
boy
a
very
youngster
whose
face
seemed
to
have
been
damaged
in
recent
conflict
his
clothes
were
dusty
and
his
hair
stood
up
like
stubble
your
row
tom
said
the
younger
girl
who
was
quiet
and
had
the
look
of
an
invalid
always
you
begins
besides
you
ca
have
cheese
there
only
a
little
bit
and
sidney
said
he
was
going
to
make
his
dinner
of
it
course
selfish
beast
now
just
listen
to
that
amy
when
he
said
it
just
that
we
might
be
afraid
to
finish
the
meat
amy
said
nothing
but
began
to
hack
fragments
off
the
bone
some
aside
for
father
first
continued
annie
holding
a
plate
be
blowed
cried
tom
just
give
me
that
first
cut
give
it
here
annie
or
i
crack
you
on
the
head
as
he
struggled
for
the
plate
amy
bent
forward
and
hit
his
arm
violently
with
the
handle
of
the
knife
this
was
the
signal
for
a
general
scrimmage
in
the
midst
of
which
tom
caught
up
a
and
flung
it
at
amy
head
the
missile
went
wide
of
its
mark
and
shivered
one
of
the
windowpanes
now
exclaimed
annie
who
had
begun
to
cry
in
consequence
of
a
blow
from
tom
fist
what
father
says
to
that
i
was
him
said
amy
in
a
low
voice
of
passion
tie
you
to
something
and
beat
you
till
you
lost
your
senses
ugly
brute
the
warfare
would
not
have
ended
here
but
that
the
door
opened
and
he
of
whom
they
spoke
made
his
appearance
in
the
past
two
years
and
a
half
john
hewett
had
become
a
shaky
old
man
of
his
grizzled
hair
very
little
remained
and
little
of
his
beard
his
features
were
shrunken
his
neck
scraggy
he
stooped
much
and
there
was
a
senile
indecision
in
his
movements
he
wore
rough
patched
clothing
had
no
collar
and
seemed
from
the
state
of
his
hands
to
have
been
engaged
in
very
dirty
work
as
he
entered
and
came
upon
the
riotous
group
his
eyes
lit
up
with
anger
in
a
strained
voice
he
shouted
a
command
of
silence
all
that
tom
father
piped
annie
no
living
with
him
john
eye
fell
on
the
broken
window
of
you
done
that
he
asked
sternly
pointing
to
it
no
one
spoke
goin
to
pay
for
it
i
like
to
know
does
it
cost
enough
to
keep
you
but
you
must
go
makin
extra
expense
where
the
money
to
come
from
i
want
to
know
if
you
go
on
like
this
he
turned
suddenly
upon
the
elder
girl
got
something
to
say
to
you
miss
why
was
you
at
work
this
morning
amy
avoided
his
look
her
pale
face
became
mottled
with
alarm
but
only
for
an
instant
then
she
hardened
herself
and
moved
her
head
insolently
was
you
at
work
where
your
week
money
have
got
any
have
got
any
why
not
for
a
while
she
was
stubbornly
silent
but
hewett
constrained
her
to
confession
at
length
on
his
way
home
he
had
been
informed
by
an
acquaintance
that
amy
was
wandering
about
the
streets
at
an
hour
when
she
ought
to
have
been
at
her
employment
unable
to
put
off
the
evil
moment
any
longer
the
girl
admitted
that
four
days
ago
she
was
dismissed
for
bad
behaviour
and
that
since
then
she
had
pretended
to
go
to
work
as
usual
the
trifling
sum
paid
to
her
on
dismissal
she
had
spent
john
turned
to
his
youngest
daughter
and
asked
in
a
hollow
voice
clara
got
one
of
her
headaches
father
replied
the
girl
trembling
he
turned
and
went
from
the
room
it
was
long
since
he
had
lost
his
place
of
porter
at
the
before
leaving
england
joseph
snowdon
managed
to
dispose
of
his
interest
in
the
firm
of
lake
snowdon
and
at
the
same
time
hewett
was
informed
that
his
wages
would
be
reduced
by
five
shillings
a
week
the
sum
which
had
been
supplied
by
michael
snowdon
benevolence
it
was
a
serious
loss
clara
marriage
removed
one
grave
anxiety
but
the
three
children
had
still
to
be
brought
up
and
with
every
year
john
chance
of
steady
employment
would
grow
less
sidney
kirkwood
declared
himself
able
and
willing
to
help
substantially
but
he
might
before
long
have
children
of
his
own
to
think
of
and
in
any
case
it
was
shameful
to
burden
him
in
this
way
shameful
or
not
it
very
soon
came
to
pass
that
sidney
had
the
whole
family
on
his
hands
a
bad
attack
of
rheumatism
in
the
succeeding
winter
made
john
incapable
of
earning
anything
at
all
for
two
months
he
was
a
cripple
till
then
sidney
and
his
wife
had
occupied
lodgings
in
holloway
when
it
became
evident
that
hewett
must
not
hope
to
be
able
to
support
his
children
and
when
sidney
had
for
many
weeks
p
aid
the
rent
as
well
as
supplying
the
money
to
live
upon
in
farringdon
road
buildings
the
house
at
crouch
end
was
taken
and
there
all
went
to
live
together
clara
health
was
very
uncertain
and
though
at
first
she
spoke
frequently
of
finding
work
to
do
at
home
the
birth
of
a
child
put
an
end
to
such
projects
amy
hewett
was
shortly
at
the
point
when
the
education
of
a
child
is
said
to
be
by
good
luck
employment
was
found
for
her
in
kentish
town
with
three
shillings
a
week
from
the
first
john
could
not
resign
himself
to
being
a
mere
burden
on
the
home
enforced
idleness
so
fretted
him
that
at
times
he
seemed
all
but
out
of
his
wits
in
despair
he
caught
at
the
strangest
kinds
of
casual
occupation
when
earning
nothing
he
would
barely
eat
enough
to
keep
himself
alive
and
if
he
succeeded
in
bringing
home
a
shilling
or
two
he
turned
the
money
about
in
his
hands
with
a
sort
of
angry
joy
that
it
would
have
made
your
heart
ache
to
witness
just
at
present
he
had
a
job
of
cleaning
and
whitewashing
some
cellars
in
stoke
newington
he
was
absent
from
the
kitchen
for
five
minutes
during
which
time
the
three
sat
round
the
table
amy
pretended
to
eat
unconcernedly
tom
made
grimaces
at
her
as
for
annie
she
cried
their
father
entered
the
room
again
did
you
tell
us
about
this
at
once
he
asked
in
a
shaking
voice
looking
at
his
daughter
with
eyes
of
blank
misery
do
know
a
bad
selfish
girl
he
broke
out
again
overcome
with
anger
you
got
neither
sense
nor
feelin
nor
honesty
just
when
you
ought
to
have
begun
to
earn
a
bit
higher
wages
when
you
ought
to
have
been
glad
to
work
your
hardest
to
show
you
was
unthankful
to
them
as
has
done
so
much
for
you
who
earned
money
to
keep
you
when
you
was
goin
to
school
who
fed
and
clothed
you
and
saw
as
you
did
want
for
nothing
who
is
it
as
you
owe
everything
to
just
tell
me
that
amy
affected
to
pay
no
attention
she
kept
swallowing
morsels
with
ugly
movements
of
her
lips
and
jaws
often
have
i
to
tell
you
all
that
if
it
was
for
sidney
kirkwood
you
have
been
workhouse
children
as
sure
as
you
livin
you
all
of
you
have
gone
to
the
workhouse
and
you
go
on
just
as
if
you
owe
thanks
to
nobody
i
tell
you
it
be
years
and
years
before
one
of
you
have
a
penny
you
can
call
your
own
if
it
was
annie
or
tom
behaved
so
careless
there
be
less
wonder
but
for
a
girl
of
your
age
i
ashamed
as
you
belong
to
me
you
ca
even
keep
your
tongue
from
bein
impudent
to
clara
her
as
you
ai
worthy
to
be
a
servant
to
a
sneak
observed
tom
with
much
coolness
always
telling
lies
about
us
your
young
head
off
your
shoulders
cried
his
father
furiously
you
talk
to
me
like
that
not
one
of
you
fit
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
i
have
done
nothing
whimpered
annie
hurt
by
being
thus
included
in
his
reprobation
more
you
have
not
just
now
but
you
often
enough
more
trouble
to
your
sister
than
you
need
be
but
it
you
i
talkin
to
amy
you
dare
to
leave
this
house
again
till
there
another
place
found
for
you
if
you
any
you
could
bear
to
look
sidney
in
the
face
suppose
you
had
such
a
brother
to
work
for
you
what
would
you
do
eh
who
buy
your
food
who
pay
the
rent
of
the
house
you
live
in
a
noteworthy
difference
between
children
of
this
standing
and
such
as
pass
their
years
of
in
homes
unshadowed
by
poverty
for
these
life
had
no
illusions
of
every
mouthful
that
they
ate
the
price
was
known
to
them
the
roof
over
their
heads
was
there
by
no
grace
of
providence
but
solely
because
a
sum
was
paid
weekly
in
hard
cash
when
the
collector
came
let
the
payment
fail
and
they
knew
perfectly
well
what
the
result
would
be
the
children
of
the
upper
world
could
not
even
by
chance
give
a
thought
to
the
sources
whence
their
needs
are
supplied
speech
on
such
a
subject
in
their
presence
would
be
held
indecent
in
john
hewett
position
the
indecency
the
crime
would
have
been
to
keep
silence
and
pretend
that
the
needs
of
existence
are
ministered
to
as
a
matter
of
course
his
tone
and
language
were
pitifully
those
of
feeble
age
the
emotion
proved
too
great
a
strain
upon
his
body
and
he
had
at
length
to
sit
down
in
a
tremulous
state
miserable
with
the
consciousness
of
failing
authority
he
would
have
made
but
a
poor
figure
now
upon
clerkenwell
green
even
as
his
frame
was
shrunken
so
had
the
circle
of
his
interests
contracted
he
could
no
longer
speak
or
think
on
the
subjects
which
had
fired
him
through
the
better
part
of
his
life
if
he
was
driven
to
try
and
utter
himself
on
the
broad
questions
of
social
wrong
of
the
people
cause
a
senile
stammering
of
incoherencies
was
the
only
result
the
fight
had
ever
gone
against
john
hewett
he
was
one
of
those
who
are
born
to
be
defeated
his
failing
energies
spent
themselves
in
conflict
with
his
own
children
the
concerns
of
a
miserable
home
were
all
his
mind
could
now
cope
with
and
sit
down
to
your
dinner
father
annie
said
when
he
became
silent
i
want
no
dinner
i
no
stomach
for
food
when
it
stolen
what
sidney
goin
to
have
when
he
comes
home
said
he
do
with
bread
and
cheese
see
we
cut
some
meat
for
you
keep
that
for
sidney
then
and
do
one
of
you
dare
to
say
anything
about
it
cut
me
a
bit
of
bread
annie
she
did
so
he
ate
it
standing
by
the
fireplace
drank
a
glass
of
water
and
went
into
the
there
he
sat
unoccupied
for
nearly
an
hour
his
head
at
times
dropping
forward
as
if
he
were
nearly
asleep
but
it
was
only
in
abstraction
the
morning
work
had
wearied
him
excessively
as
such
effort
always
did
but
the
mental
misery
he
was
suffering
made
him
unconscious
of
bodily
fatigue
the
clinking
and
grinding
of
the
gate
drew
his
attention
he
stood
up
and
saw
his
returned
from
clerkenwell
when
he
had
heard
the
grind
and
shake
and
close
he
called
sidney
looked
into
the
parlour
with
a
smile
in
here
a
minute
i
want
to
speak
to
you
it
was
a
face
that
told
of
many
troubles
sidney
might
resolutely
keep
a
bright
countenance
but
there
was
no
hiding
the
sallowness
of
his
cheeks
and
the
lines
drawn
by
anxiety
the
effect
of
a
struggle
with
mean
necessities
is
seldom
anything
but
degradation
in
look
and
in
character
but
sidney
temper
and
the
conditions
of
his
life
preserved
him
against
that
danger
his
features
worn
into
thinness
seem
to
present
more
distinctly
than
ever
their
points
of
refinement
you
saw
that
he
was
habitually
a
grave
and
silent
man
all
the
more
attractive
his
aspect
when
as
now
he
seemed
to
rest
from
thought
and
give
expression
to
his
natural
kindliness
in
the
matter
of
attire
he
was
no
longer
as
careful
as
he
used
to
be
the
clothes
he
wore
had
done
more
than
just
service
and
hung
about
him
unregarded
upstairs
he
asked
when
he
had
noticed
hewett
look
she
lying
down
may
been
troublesome
all
the
morning
but
it
was
something
else
i
meant
and
john
began
to
speak
of
amy
he
had
always
in
some
degree
a
sense
of
shame
when
he
spoke
privately
with
sidney
always
felt
painfully
the
injustice
involved
in
their
relations
at
present
he
could
not
look
kirkwood
in
the
face
and
his
tone
was
that
of
a
man
who
abases
himself
to
make
confession
of
guilt
sidney
was
gravely
concerned
it
was
his
habit
to
deal
with
the
children
faults
to
urge
john
not
to
take
a
sombre
view
of
their
thoughtlessness
but
the
present
instance
could
not
be
made
light
of
secretly
he
had
always
expected
that
the
girl
would
be
a
source
of
more
serious
trouble
the
older
she
grew
he
sat
in
silence
leaning
forward
his
eyes
bent
down
no
good
whatever
say
lamented
hewett
do
heed
me
why
must
i
have
children
like
these
have
i
always
done
my
best
to
teach
them
to
be
honest
and
if
i
spent
my
life
in
the
worst
ways
a
man
can
they
could
have
turned
out
more
worthless
have
i
wished
always
what
was
right
and
good
and
true
have
i
always
spoke
up
for
justice
in
the
world
have
i
done
what
i
could
sidney
to
be
helpful
to
them
as
fell
into
misfortune
and
now
in
my
old
age
i
only
a
burden
and
the
children
as
come
after
me
are
nothing
but
a
misery
to
all
as
have
to
do
with
them
if
it
was
for
clara
i
feel
i
could
live
my
time
out
she
the
one
that
pays
me
back
for
the
love
i
given
her
all
the
others
i
ca
feel
as
they
children
of
mine
at
all
it
was
a
strange
and
touching
thing
that
he
seemed
nowadays
utterly
to
have
forgotten
clara
past
invariably
he
spoke
of
her
as
if
she
had
at
all
times
been
his
stay
and
comfort
the
name
of
his
son
who
was
dead
never
passed
his
lips
but
of
clara
he
could
not
speak
too
long
or
too
tenderly
ca
think
what
to
do
sidney
said
i
talk
to
her
in
a
way
she
only
dislike
me
the
more
she
feels
i
no
business
to
interfere
too
soft
with
them
you
spoil
them
why
there
one
of
them
broken
a
pane
in
the
kitchen
and
they
know
you
take
it
quiet
like
you
do
everything
else
sidney
wrinkled
his
brow
these
petty
expenses
ever
repeated
were
just
what
made
the
difficulty
in
his
budget
he
winced
whenever
such
demands
encroached
upon
the
poor
weekly
income
of
which
every
penny
was
too
little
for
the
serious
needs
of
the
family
feeling
that
if
he
sat
and
thought
much
longer
a
dark
mood
would
seize
upon
him
he
rose
hastily
shall
try
kindness
with
her
do
say
anything
more
in
her
hearing
he
went
to
the
and
cried
cheerfully
dinner
ready
girls
annie
voice
replied
with
a
timorous
affirmative
right
i
be
down
in
a
minute
treading
as
gently
as
possible
he
ascended
the
stairs
and
entered
his
bedroom
the
blind
was
drawn
down
but
sunlight
shone
through
it
and
made
a
softened
glow
in
the
chamber
in
a
little
cot
was
sitting
his
child
may
rather
more
than
a
year
old
she
had
toys
about
her
and
was
for
the
moment
contented
clara
lay
on
the
bed
her
face
turned
so
that
sidney
could
not
see
it
he
spoke
to
her
and
she
just
moved
her
arm
but
gave
no
reply
you
wish
to
be
left
alone
he
asked
in
a
subdued
and
troubled
voice
i
take
may
downstairs
you
like
do
speak
to
me
now
he
remained
standing
by
the
bed
for
a
minute
then
turned
his
eyes
on
the
child
who
smiled
at
him
he
could
not
smile
in
return
but
went
quietly
away
one
of
her
bad
days
whispered
hewett
who
met
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
ca
help
it
poor
girl
no
sidney
ate
what
was
put
before
him
without
giving
a
thought
to
it
when
his
eyes
wandered
round
the
kitchen
the
disorder
and
dirt
worried
him
but
on
that
subject
he
could
not
speak
his
hunger
appeased
he
looked
steadily
at
amy
and
said
in
a
kindly
tone
tells
me
you
had
a
stroke
of
bad
luck
amy
we
must
have
a
try
at
another
place
must
we
hollo
there
a
window
broken
has
tom
been
playing
at
cricket
in
the
room
eh
the
girls
kept
silence
and
let
make
out
the
list
for
our
shopping
this
afternoon
he
continued
afraid
there
have
to
be
something
the
less
for
that
window
girls
what
do
say
do
without
a
pudding
sidney
suggested
annie
come
now
i
fond
of
pudding
thus
it
was
always
if
he
could
not
direct
by
kindness
he
would
never
try
to
rule
by
harsh
words
six
years
ago
it
was
not
so
easy
for
him
to
be
gentle
under
provocation
and
he
would
then
have
made
a
better
disciplinarian
in
such
a
home
as
this
on
amy
and
tom
all
his
rare
goodness
was
thrown
away
never
mind
shall
one
go
over
to
the
side
of
evil
because
one
despairs
of
vanquishing
it
the
budget
the
budget
always
so
many
things
perforce
cut
out
always
such
cruel
pressure
of
things
that
not
be
cut
out
in
the
early
days
of
his
marriage
he
had
accustomed
himself
to
a
liberality
of
expenditure
out
of
proportion
to
his
income
the
little
store
of
savings
allowed
him
to
indulge
his
kindness
to
clara
and
her
relatives
and
he
kept
putting
off
to
the
future
that
strict
revision
of
outlay
which
his
position
of
course
demanded
the
day
when
he
had
no
longer
a
choice
came
all
too
soon
with
alarm
he
discovered
that
his
savings
had
melted
away
the
few
sovereigns
remaining
must
be
sternly
guarded
for
the
hour
of
stern
necessity
how
it
ground
on
his
sensibilities
when
he
was
compelled
to
refuse
some
request
from
clara
or
the
girls
his
generous
nature
suffered
pangs
of
as
often
as
there
was
talk
of
economy
for
instance
whilst
he
was
worrying
in
thought
over
amy
behaviour
and
at
the
same
time
trying
to
cut
down
the
saturday
purchases
in
order
to
pay
for
the
broken
window
up
comes
tom
with
the
announcement
that
he
lost
his
hat
this
morning
and
had
to
return
bareheaded
another
unforeseen
expense
and
sidney
was
angry
with
himself
for
his
impulse
of
anger
against
the
boy
clara
never
went
out
to
make
purchases
seldom
indeed
left
the
house
for
any
reason
unless
sidney
persuaded
her
to
walk
a
short
distance
with
him
after
sundown
when
she
veiled
herself
closely
neither
amy
nor
anne
could
be
trusted
to
do
all
the
shopping
so
that
sidney
generally
accompanied
one
or
other
of
them
for
that
purpose
on
saturday
afternoon
he
asked
amy
to
go
with
him
wishing
if
possible
to
influence
her
for
good
by
kind
brotherly
talk
whilst
she
was
getting
ready
he
took
john
aside
into
the
parlour
to
impart
a
strange
piece
of
news
he
had
brought
from
clerkenwell
peckover
has
had
a
narrow
escape
of
being
poisoned
she
was
found
by
one
of
her
lodgers
all
but
dead
and
last
night
the
police
arrested
her
daughter
on
the
charge
snowdon
the
mother
has
accused
her
there
a
man
concerned
in
the
affair
one
of
the
men
showed
me
a
report
in
paper
i
buy
one
because
we
shall
have
it
in
the
sunday
paper
nice
business
oh
for
the
old
woman
money
i
wager
exclaimed
hewett
in
an
awed
voice
can
believe
it
of
clem
if
ever
there
was
a
downright
bad
was
she
living
in
the
close
snowdon
was
somewhere
in
hoxton
no
doubt
it
was
for
the
money
if
the
charge
is
true
we
wo
speak
of
it
before
the
children
of
that
now
many
the
time
i
looked
at
clem
peckover
and
said
to
myself
you
come
to
no
good
end
my
lady
she
was
a
fierce
an
bad
sidney
nodded
and
went
off
for
his
walk
with
amy
it
was
a
difficult
thing
to
keep
any
room
in
the
house
orderly
and
sidney
as
part
of
his
struggle
against
the
downward
tendency
in
all
about
him
against
the
forces
of
chaos
often
did
the
work
of
housemaid
in
the
parlour
a
little
laxity
in
the
rules
which
made
this
a
sacred
corner
and
there
would
have
been
no
spot
where
he
could
rest
with
some
success
too
he
had
resisted
the
habit
prevalent
in
homes
of
prolonging
saturday
evening
occupations
until
the
early
hours
of
sunday
morning
at
a
little
after
ten
tonight
john
hewett
and
the
children
were
in
bed
he
too
weary
in
mind
and
body
would
gladly
have
gone
upstairs
but
he
lingered
from
one
five
minutes
to
the
next
his
heart
sinking
at
the
certainty
that
he
would
find
clara
in
sleepless
misery
which
he
had
no
power
to
allay
round
the
walls
of
the
parlour
were
hung
his
own
drawings
which
used
to
conceal
the
bareness
of
his
lodging
in
tysoe
street
it
was
three
years
since
he
had
touched
a
pencil
the
last
time
having
been
when
he
made
holiday
with
michael
snowdon
and
jane
at
the
by
danbury
hill
the
impulse
would
never
come
again
it
was
associated
with
happiness
with
hope
and
what
had
his
life
to
do
with
one
or
the
other
could
he
have
effected
the
change
without
the
necessity
of
explaining
it
he
would
gladly
have
put
those
drawings
out
of
sight
whenever
as
now
he
consciously
regarded
them
they
plucked
painfully
at
his
and
threatened
to
make
him
a
coward
none
of
that
he
had
his
work
to
do
happiness
or
no
happiness
and
by
all
the
virtue
of
manhood
he
would
not
fail
in
it
as
far
as
success
or
failure
was
a
question
of
his
own
resolve
the
few
books
he
owned
were
placed
on
hanging
shelves
among
them
those
which
he
had
purchased
for
clara
since
their
marriage
but
reading
was
as
much
a
thing
of
the
past
as
drawing
never
a
moment
when
his
mind
was
sufficiently
at
ease
to
refresh
itself
with
other
men
thoughts
or
fancies
as
with
john
hewett
so
with
himself
the
circle
of
his
interests
had
shrivelled
until
it
included
nothing
but
the
cares
of
his
family
the
cost
of
house
and
food
and
firing
as
a
younger
man
he
had
believed
that
he
knew
what
was
meant
by
the
struggle
for
existence
in
the
nether
world
it
seemed
to
him
now
as
if
such
knowledge
had
been
only
theoretical
oh
it
was
easy
to
preach
a
high
ideal
of
existence
for
the
poor
as
long
as
one
had
a
considerable
margin
over
the
expenses
easy
to
rebuke
the
men
and
women
who
tried
to
forget
themselves
in
and
as
long
as
one
could
take
up
some
rational
amusement
with
a
quiet
heart
now
on
his
return
home
from
labour
it
was
all
he
could
do
not
to
sink
in
exhaustion
and
defeat
of
spirit
shillings
and
pence
shillings
and
pence
never
a
question
of
pounds
unfortunately
and
always
too
few
of
them
he
understood
how
men
have
gone
mad
under
pressure
of
household
cares
he
realised
the
horrible
temptation
which
has
made
men
turn
dastardly
from
the
path
leading
homeward
and
leave
those
there
to
shift
for
themselves
when
on
the
point
of
lowering
the
lamp
he
heard
someone
coming
downstairs
the
door
opened
and
to
his
surprise
clara
came
in
familiarity
could
not
make
him
insensible
to
that
disfigurement
of
her
once
beautiful
face
his
eyes
always
fell
before
her
at
the
first
moment
of
meeting
are
you
doing
she
asked
do
you
come
up
was
that
minute
coming
his
hand
went
again
to
the
lamp
but
she
checked
him
in
a
low
wailing
voice
and
with
a
passionate
gesture
she
exclaimed
i
feel
as
if
i
should
go
mad
i
ca
bear
it
much
longer
sidney
was
silent
at
first
then
said
quietly
sit
here
for
a
little
no
wonder
you
feel
lying
in
that
room
all
day
i
gladly
have
come
and
sat
with
you
but
my
company
only
seems
to
irritate
you
good
can
you
do
me
you
only
think
i
making
you
miserable
without
a
cause
you
wo
say
it
but
that
what
you
always
think
and
when
i
feel
that
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
near
if
only
i
could
die
and
come
to
the
end
of
it
how
can
you
tell
what
i
suffer
oh
yes
you
speak
so
calmly
as
good
as
telling
me
i
am
unreasonable
because
i
ca
do
the
same
i
hate
to
hear
your
voice
when
it
like
that
rather
you
raged
at
me
or
struck
me
the
beauty
of
her
form
had
lost
nothing
since
the
evening
when
he
visited
her
in
farringdon
road
buildings
now
as
then
all
her
movements
were
full
of
grace
and
natural
dignity
whenever
strong
feeling
was
active
in
her
she
could
not
but
manifest
it
in
motion
unlike
that
of
ordinary
women
her
hair
hung
in
disorder
though
not
at
its
full
length
massing
itself
upon
her
shoulders
shadowing
her
forehead
by
the
fire
that
only
death
would
extinguish
she
looked
the
taller
for
her
slenderness
ah
had
the
face
been
untouched
are
unjust
to
me
sidney
replied
with
emotion
but
not
resentfully
can
enter
into
all
your
sufferings
if
i
speak
calmly
it
because
i
because
i
dare
give
way
one
of
us
must
try
and
be
strong
clara
or
else
he
turned
away
us
leave
this
house
she
continued
hardly
noticing
what
he
said
us
live
in
some
other
place
never
any
change
always
always
the
same
walls
to
look
at
day
and
night
it
driving
me
mad
we
ca
move
i
dare
spend
even
the
little
money
it
would
cost
do
you
know
what
amy
has
been
doing
father
told
me
can
we
go
to
the
least
needless
expense
when
every
day
makes
living
harder
for
us
have
we
to
do
with
them
how
can
you
be
expected
to
keep
a
whole
family
it
is
fair
to
you
or
to
me
you
sacrifice
me
to
them
nothing
to
you
what
i
endure
so
long
as
they
are
kept
in
comfort
he
stepped
nearer
to
her
do
you
really
mean
by
that
is
it
seriously
your
wish
that
i
should
tell
them
your
father
and
your
sisters
and
our
brother
to
leave
the
house
and
support
themselves
as
best
they
can
pray
what
would
become
of
them
kept
in
comfort
are
they
how
much
does
your
poor
father
enjoy
do
you
wish
me
to
tell
him
to
go
out
into
the
street
as
i
can
help
him
no
more
she
moaned
and
made
a
wild
gesture
know
all
this
to
be
impossible
you
do
wish
it
you
bear
it
then
why
will
you
drive
me
almost
to
despair
by
complaining
so
of
what
ca
be
helped
surely
you
foresaw
it
all
you
knew
that
i
was
only
a
working
man
it
is
as
if
there
had
been
any
hope
of
my
making
a
larger
income
and
you
were
disappointed
it
make
it
easier
to
bear
because
there
is
no
hope
of
relief
she
cried
me
yes
if
there
hope
i
might
fret
under
the
misery
i
had
hope
once
it
might
have
been
so
different
with
me
the
thought
burns
and
burns
and
burns
till
i
am
frantic
you
do
help
me
to
bear
it
you
leave
me
alone
when
i
most
need
help
how
can
know
what
it
means
to
me
to
look
back
and
think
of
what
might
have
been
you
say
to
yourself
i
am
selfish
that
i
ought
to
be
thankful
took
pity
on
me
poor
wretched
creature
that
i
am
it
would
have
been
kinder
never
to
have
come
near
me
i
should
have
killed
myself
long
ago
and
there
an
end
you
thought
it
was
a
great
thing
to
take
me
when
you
might
have
had
a
wife
who
would
clara
when
you
speak
like
that
i
could
almost
believe
you
are
really
mad
for
heaven
sake
think
what
you
are
saying
suppose
i
were
to
reproach
you
with
having
consented
to
marry
me
i
would
rather
die
than
let
such
a
word
pass
my
lips
but
suppose
you
heard
me
speaking
to
you
like
this
she
drew
a
deep
sigh
and
let
her
hands
fall
sidney
continued
in
quite
another
voice
one
of
the
hardest
things
i
have
to
bear
that
i
ca
make
your
life
pleasanter
of
course
you
need
change
i
know
it
only
too
well
you
and
i
ought
to
have
our
holiday
at
this
time
of
the
year
like
other
people
i
fancy
i
should
like
to
go
into
the
country
myself
clerkenwell
is
such
a
beautiful
place
that
one
can
be
content
to
go
there
day
after
day
year
after
year
without
variety
but
we
have
no
money
suffer
as
we
may
there
no
help
for
it
because
we
have
no
money
lives
may
be
wasted
worse
far
worse
than
wasted
just
because
there
is
no
money
at
this
moment
a
whole
world
of
men
and
women
is
in
pain
and
sorrow
because
they
have
no
money
how
often
have
we
said
that
the
world
is
made
so
everything
has
to
be
bought
with
money
find
it
easier
to
bear
than
i
do
i
find
it
easier
i
am
and
at
all
events
i
have
some
variety
whilst
you
have
none
i
know
it
if
i
could
take
your
share
of
the
burden
how
gladly
i
do
so
if
i
could
take
your
suffering
upon
myself
you
should
be
unhappy
for
another
minute
but
that
is
another
impossible
thing
people
who
are
fortunate
in
life
may
ask
each
day
what
they
do
we
have
always
to
remind
ourselves
what
we
take
a
pleasure
in
repeating
such
things
it
shows
how
little
you
feel
them
shows
how
i
have
taken
to
heart
the
truth
of
them
she
waved
her
hand
impatiently
again
sighed
and
moved
towards
the
door
go
just
yet
said
sidney
have
more
to
say
to
each
other
have
nothing
more
to
say
i
am
miserable
and
you
ca
help
me
can
clara
she
looked
at
him
with
wondering
estranged
eyes
what
are
you
going
to
do
speak
to
you
that
all
i
have
nothing
to
give
but
words
but
she
would
have
left
him
sidney
stepped
forward
and
prevented
her
you
hear
what
i
have
got
to
say
they
may
be
only
words
but
if
i
have
no
power
to
move
you
with
my
words
then
our
life
has
come
to
utter
ruin
and
i
do
know
what
dreadful
things
lie
before
us
can
say
the
same
she
replied
in
a
despairing
tone
neither
you
nor
i
shall
say
it
as
long
as
i
have
strength
to
speak
i
wo
consent
to
say
that
clara
you
must
put
your
hand
in
mine
and
think
of
your
life
and
mine
as
one
if
not
for
my
sake
then
for
your
child
think
do
you
wish
may
to
suffer
for
the
faults
of
her
parents
wish
she
had
never
been
born
yet
you
were
the
happier
for
her
birth
it
only
these
last
six
months
that
you
have
fallen
again
into
misery
you
indulge
it
and
it
grows
worse
harder
to
resist
you
may
say
that
life
seems
to
grow
worse
perhaps
so
this
affair
of
amy
has
been
a
heavy
blow
and
we
shall
miss
the
little
money
she
brought
goodness
knows
when
another
place
will
be
found
for
her
but
all
the
more
reason
why
we
should
help
each
other
to
struggle
perhaps
just
this
year
or
two
will
be
our
hardest
time
if
amy
and
annie
and
tom
were
once
all
earning
something
the
worst
would
be
over
would
it
and
ca
we
find
strength
to
hold
out
a
little
longer
just
to
give
the
children
a
start
in
life
just
to
make
your
father
last
years
a
bit
happier
if
we
manage
it
sha
we
feel
glad
in
looking
back
wo
it
be
something
worth
having
lived
for
he
paused
but
clara
had
no
word
for
him
amy
she
a
hard
girl
to
manage
partly
because
she
has
very
bad
health
i
always
think
of
that
or
try
to
when
she
irritates
me
this
afternoon
i
took
her
out
with
me
and
spoke
as
kindly
as
i
could
if
she
is
better
for
it
she
surely
ca
be
worse
and
in
any
case
i
do
know
what
else
to
do
look
clara
you
and
i
are
going
to
do
what
we
can
for
these
children
we
not
going
to
give
up
the
work
now
we
begun
it
must
all
of
us
who
are
poor
stand
together
and
help
one
another
we
have
to
fight
against
the
rich
world
that
always
crushing
us
down
down
whether
it
means
to
or
not
those
people
enjoy
their
lives
well
i
shall
find
enjoyment
in
defying
them
to
make
me
despair
but
i
ca
do
without
your
help
i
did
feel
very
cheerful
as
i
sat
here
a
while
ago
before
you
came
down
i
was
almost
afraid
to
go
upstairs
lest
the
sight
of
what
you
were
suffering
should
be
too
much
for
me
am
i
to
ask
a
kindness
of
you
and
be
refused
clara
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
experienced
the
constraining
power
of
his
words
when
he
was
moved
with
passionate
earnestness
her
desire
to
escape
was
due
to
a
fear
of
yielding
of
suffering
her
egotism
to
fail
before
a
stronger
will
me
go
she
said
whilst
he
held
her
arm
feel
too
ill
to
talk
longer
one
word
only
one
promise
now
whilst
we
are
the
only
ones
awake
in
the
house
we
are
husband
and
wife
clara
and
we
must
be
kind
to
each
other
we
are
not
going
to
be
like
the
poor
creatures
who
let
their
misery
degrade
them
we
are
both
too
proud
for
that
what
we
can
think
and
express
our
thoughts
we
can
speak
to
each
other
minds
and
hearts
do
let
us
be
beaten
the
good
of
my
promising
i
ca
keep
it
i
suffer
too
much
and
keep
the
promise
for
a
few
weeks
a
few
days
then
find
strength
to
help
you
once
more
but
now
it
your
turn
to
help
me
begins
a
new
week
the
rich
world
allows
us
to
rest
to
be
with
each
other
shall
we
make
it
a
quiet
restful
hopeful
day
when
they
go
out
in
the
morning
you
shall
read
to
father
and
me
read
as
you
know
how
to
so
much
better
than
i
can
what
was
that
really
a
smile
me
go
sidney
oh
i
tired
i
tired
the
promise
do
my
best
it
wo
last
long
but
i
try
you
dear
she
replied
despondently
i
that
ought
to
thank
you
but
i
never
shall
never
i
only
understand
you
now
and
then
just
for
an
hour
and
all
the
selfishness
comes
back
again
it
be
the
same
till
i
dead
he
put
out
the
lamp
and
followed
her
upstairs
his
limbs
ached
he
could
scarcely
drag
one
leg
after
the
other
never
mind
the
battle
was
gained
once
more
chapter
xl
jane
poisoning
business
startled
me
i
should
at
all
wonder
if
i
had
a
precious
narrow
squeak
of
something
of
the
kind
myself
before
i
took
my
departure
in
fact
a
sort
of
fear
of
the
animal
made
me
settle
things
as
sharp
as
i
could
let
me
know
the
result
of
the
trial
wonder
whether
there
be
any
disagreeable
remarks
about
a
certain
acquaintance
of
yours
detained
abroad
on
business
better
send
me
newspapers
same
name
and
address
but
i
something
considerably
more
important
to
think
about
a
big
thing
i
scarcely
dare
tell
you
how
big
i
stand
to
win
not
a
soul
outside
suspects
the
ring
when
i
tell
you
that
is
in
it
you
see
that
i
struck
the
right
ticket
this
time
let
me
hear
about
jane
if
all
goes
well
here
and
you
manage
that
little
business
you
shall
have
just
for
you
know
i
suppose
you
have
your
partnership
in
a
few
months
extracts
from
a
letter
with
an
american
stamp
which
scawthorne
read
as
he
waited
for
his
breakfast
it
was
the
end
of
october
and
cool
enough
to
make
the
crackling
fire
grateful
having
mused
over
the
epistle
our
friend
took
up
his
morning
paper
and
glanced
at
the
report
of
criminal
trials
whilst
he
was
so
engaged
his
landlady
entered
carrying
a
tray
of
appetising
appearance
byass
he
said
with
much
friendliness
then
in
a
lower
voice
a
fuller
report
here
than
there
was
in
the
evening
paper
perhaps
you
looked
at
it
yes
sir
i
thought
you
would
mind
replied
bessie
arranging
the
table
be
taken
care
of
or
three
years
at
all
events
you
seen
her
that
day
she
came
here
after
miss
snowdon
understand
how
glad
i
feel
that
she
out
of
the
way
i
sure
been
uneasy
ever
since
if
ever
there
comes
a
rather
loud
knock
at
there
i
begin
to
tremble
i
do
indeed
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
get
over
it
dare
say
miss
snowdon
will
be
easier
in
mind
should
wonder
but
she
wo
say
anything
about
it
she
feels
the
disgrace
so
much
and
i
know
it
almost
more
than
she
can
do
to
go
to
work
just
because
she
thinks
they
talk
about
her
that
very
soon
pass
over
there
always
something
new
happening
and
people
quickly
forget
a
case
like
this
bessie
withdrew
and
her
lodger
addressed
himself
to
his
breakfast
he
had
occupied
the
rooms
on
the
first
floor
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
joseph
snowdon
proposal
to
make
him
acquainted
with
jane
had
not
been
carried
out
scawthorne
deeming
it
impracticable
but
when
a
year
had
gone
by
and
scawthorne
as
joseph
confidential
correspondent
had
still
to
report
that
jane
maintained
herself
in
independence
he
one
day
presented
himself
in
hanover
street
as
a
total
stranger
and
made
inquiry
about
the
rooms
which
a
card
told
him
were
to
let
his
improved
position
allowed
him
to
live
somewhat
more
reputably
than
in
the
chelsea
lodging
and
hanover
street
would
suit
him
well
enough
until
he
obtained
the
promised
partnership
admitted
as
a
friend
to
percival
house
in
highbury
he
had
by
this
time
made
the
acquaintance
of
miss
lant
whom
by
the
exercise
of
his
agreeable
qualities
he
one
day
led
to
speak
of
jane
snowdon
miss
lant
continued
to
see
jane
at
long
intervals
and
was
fervent
in
her
praise
as
well
as
in
compassionating
the
trials
through
which
she
had
gone
his
position
in
percival
office
of
course
made
it
natural
that
scawthorne
should
have
a
knowledge
of
the
girl
story
when
he
had
established
himself
in
byass
rooms
he
mentioned
the
fact
casually
to
his
friends
making
it
appear
that
in
seeking
lodgings
he
had
come
upon
these
by
haphazard
he
could
not
but
feel
something
of
genuine
interest
in
a
girl
who
for
whatever
reason
declined
a
sufficient
allowance
and
chose
to
work
for
her
living
the
grounds
upon
which
jane
took
this
decision
were
altogether
unknown
to
him
until
an
explanation
came
from
her
father
joseph
when
news
of
the
matter
reached
him
was
disposed
to
entertain
suspicions
with
every
care
not
to
betray
his
own
whereabouts
he
wrote
to
jane
and
in
due
time
received
a
reply
in
which
jane
told
him
truly
her
reasons
for
refusing
the
money
these
joseph
communicated
to
scawthorne
and
the
latter
interest
was
still
more
strongly
awakened
he
was
now
on
terms
of
personal
acquaintance
almost
of
friendship
with
jane
miss
lant
he
was
convinced
did
not
speak
of
her
too
praisingly
not
exactly
a
pretty
girl
though
far
from
displeasing
in
countenance
very
quiet
very
gentle
with
much
natural
refinement
her
air
of
sadness
by
no
means
forced
upon
the
vulgar
eye
but
unmistakable
when
you
studied
her
was
indicative
of
faithful
sensibilities
scawthorne
had
altogether
lost
sight
of
sidney
kirkwood
and
of
the
hewetts
he
knew
they
were
all
gone
to
a
remote
part
of
london
and
more
than
this
he
had
no
longer
any
care
to
discover
on
excellent
terms
with
his
landlady
he
skilfully
elicited
from
her
now
and
then
a
confidential
remark
with
regard
to
jane
of
late
indeed
he
had
established
something
like
a
sentimental
understanding
with
the
good
bessie
so
that
whenever
he
mentioned
jane
she
fell
into
a
pleasant
little
flutter
feeling
that
she
understood
what
was
in
progress
why
not
he
kept
asking
himself
joseph
snowdon
who
addressed
his
letters
to
hanover
street
in
a
feigned
hand
seemed
to
have
an
undeniable
affection
for
the
girl
and
was
constant
in
his
promises
of
providing
a
handsome
dowry
the
latter
was
not
a
point
of
such
importance
as
a
few
years
ago
but
the
dollars
would
be
acceptable
and
then
the
truth
was
scawthorne
felt
himself
more
and
more
inclined
to
put
a
certain
question
to
jane
dowry
or
none
yes
she
felt
it
as
a
disgrace
poor
girl
when
she
saw
the
name
in
the
newspaper
in
such
a
shameful
and
horrible
connection
her
impulse
was
to
flee
to
hide
herself
it
was
dreadful
to
go
to
her
work
and
hear
the
girls
talking
of
this
attempted
murder
the
new
misery
came
upon
her
just
as
she
was
regaining
something
of
her
natural
spirits
after
long
sorrow
and
depression
which
had
affected
her
health
but
circumstances
now
as
ever
seemed
to
plot
that
at
a
critical
moment
of
her
own
experience
she
should
be
called
out
of
herself
and
constrained
to
become
the
consoler
of
others
for
some
months
the
domestic
peace
of
and
byass
had
been
gravely
disturbed
unlike
the
household
at
crouch
end
it
was
to
prosperity
that
sam
and
his
wife
owed
their
troubles
year
after
year
sam
position
had
improved
he
was
now
in
receipt
of
a
salary
which
made
or
ought
to
have
made
things
at
home
very
comfortable
though
his
children
were
now
four
in
number
he
could
supply
their
wants
he
could
buy
bessie
a
new
gown
without
very
grave
consideration
and
could
regard
his
own
shiny
when
he
donned
it
in
the
place
of
one
that
was
really
respectable
enough
without
twinges
of
conscience
but
sam
was
not
remarkable
for
wisdom
indeed
had
he
been
anything
more
than
a
foolish
he
would
scarcely
have
thriven
as
he
did
in
the
city
when
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
rattling
loose
silver
in
his
pocket
the
next
thing
as
a
matter
of
course
was
that
he
accustomed
himself
to
pay
far
too
frequent
visits
to
city
bars
on
certain
days
in
the
week
he
invariably
came
home
with
a
very
red
face
and
a
titubating
walk
when
bessie
received
him
angrily
he
defended
himself
on
the
great
plea
of
business
necessities
as
a
town
traveller
there
was
no
possibility
he
alleged
of
declining
invitations
to
refresh
himself
just
as
incumbent
upon
him
was
it
to
extend
casual
hospitality
to
those
with
whom
he
had
business
fiddle
cried
bessie
you
city
fellows
are
the
same
you
encourage
each
other
in
drink
drink
drinking
whenever
you
have
a
chance
and
then
you
say
it
all
a
matter
of
business
i
wo
have
you
coming
home
in
that
state
so
there
i
wo
have
a
husband
as
drinks
why
you
ca
stand
straight
stand
straight
echoed
sam
with
vast
scorn
here
and
he
shouldered
the
poker
with
the
result
that
one
of
the
globes
on
the
chandelier
came
in
shivers
about
his
head
this
was
too
much
bessie
fumed
and
for
a
couple
of
hours
the
quarrel
was
unappeasable
worse
was
to
come
sam
occasionally
stayed
out
very
late
at
night
and
on
his
return
alleged
a
appointment
bessie
at
length
refused
to
accept
these
excuses
she
could
and
would
believe
them
do
shouted
sam
understand
that
i
shall
come
home
just
when
i
like
if
you
make
a
bother
i
wo
come
home
at
all
so
there
you
have
it
a
bad
husband
and
a
beast
was
bessie
retort
shortly
after
that
bessie
received
information
of
such
grave
misconduct
on
her
husband
part
that
she
all
but
resolved
to
forsake
the
house
and
with
the
children
seek
refuge
under
her
parents
roof
at
woolwich
sam
had
been
seen
in
indescribable
company
no
permissible
words
would
characterise
the
individuals
with
whom
he
had
roamed
shamelessly
on
the
pavement
of
oxford
street
when
he
next
met
her
quite
sober
and
with
exasperatingly
innocent
expression
bessie
refused
to
open
her
lips
neither
that
evening
nor
the
next
would
she
utter
a
word
to
him
and
the
effort
it
cost
her
was
tremendous
the
result
was
that
on
the
third
evening
sam
did
not
appear
it
was
a
week
after
clem
trial
jane
had
been
keeping
to
herself
as
much
as
possible
but
having
occasion
to
go
down
into
the
kitchen
late
at
night
she
found
bessie
in
tears
utterly
miserable
bother
about
me
was
the
reply
to
her
sympathetic
question
got
your
own
upsets
to
think
of
you
might
have
come
to
speak
to
me
before
this
but
never
mind
it
nothing
to
you
it
needed
much
coaxing
to
persuade
her
to
detail
sam
enormities
but
she
found
much
relief
when
she
had
done
so
and
wept
more
copiously
than
ever
nearly
twelve
and
there
no
sign
of
him
perhaps
he
wo
come
at
all
he
in
bad
company
and
if
he
stays
away
all
night
i
never
speak
to
him
again
as
long
as
i
live
oh
he
a
beast
of
a
husband
is
sam
sam
came
not
all
through
that
night
did
jane
keep
her
friend
company
for
sam
came
not
in
the
morning
a
letter
addressed
in
his
commercial
hand
bessie
read
it
and
screamed
sam
wrote
to
her
that
he
had
accepted
a
position
as
country
traveller
and
he
might
be
able
to
look
in
at
his
home
on
that
day
month
jane
could
not
go
to
work
the
case
had
become
very
serious
indeed
bessie
was
in
hysterics
the
four
children
made
the
roof
ring
with
their
lamentations
at
this
juncture
jane
put
forth
all
her
beneficent
energy
it
happened
that
bessie
was
just
now
servantless
there
was
scawthorne
breakfast
only
half
prepared
jane
had
to
see
to
it
herself
and
herself
take
it
upstairs
then
bessie
must
go
to
bed
or
assuredly
she
would
be
so
ill
that
calamities
would
befall
the
infants
jane
would
have
an
eye
to
everything
only
let
jane
be
trusted
the
miserable
day
passed
after
trying
in
vain
to
sleep
bessie
walked
about
her
with
face
and
rumpled
gown
always
thinking
it
possible
that
sam
had
only
played
a
trick
and
that
he
would
come
but
he
came
not
and
again
it
was
night
at
eight
scawthorne
bell
rang
impossible
for
bessie
to
present
herself
jane
would
go
she
ascended
to
the
room
which
had
once
ah
once
been
her
own
parlour
knocked
and
entered
i
wished
to
speak
to
byass
said
scawthorne
appearing
for
some
reason
or
other
embarrassed
by
jane
presenting
herself
byass
is
not
at
all
well
sir
but
i
let
her
know
no
on
no
account
i
get
you
anything
sir
snowdon
might
i
speak
with
you
for
a
few
moments
jane
feared
it
might
be
a
complaint
in
a
perfectly
natural
way
she
walked
forward
scawthorne
came
in
her
direction
and
closed
the
door
the
interview
lasted
ten
minutes
then
jane
came
forth
and
with
a
light
quick
step
ran
up
to
the
floor
above
she
did
not
enter
the
room
however
but
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
door
in
the
darkness
a
minute
or
two
and
with
the
same
light
hurried
step
she
descended
the
stairs
sprang
past
the
lodger
room
sped
down
to
the
kitchen
under
other
circumstances
bessie
must
surely
have
noticed
a
strangeness
in
her
look
in
her
manner
but
bessie
had
thought
for
nothing
but
her
own
calamities
another
day
and
no
further
news
from
sam
the
next
morning
instead
of
going
to
work
the
loss
of
wages
was
most
serious
but
it
could
be
helped
jane
privately
betook
herself
to
sam
house
of
business
byass
was
ill
would
they
let
her
know
byass
address
that
he
might
immediately
be
communicated
with
the
information
was
readily
supplied
byass
was
no
farther
away
at
present
than
albans
forth
into
the
street
again
and
in
search
of
a
policeman
you
please
to
tell
me
what
station
i
have
to
go
to
for
st
albans
why
moorgate
street
would
do
only
a
few
minutes
walk
away
on
she
hastened
is
the
cost
of
a
return
ticket
to
albans
please
back
into
the
street
again
she
must
now
look
for
a
certain
sign
indicating
a
certain
place
of
business
with
some
little
trouble
it
is
found
she
enters
a
dark
passage
and
comes
before
a
counter
upon
which
she
lays
a
watch
her
grandfather
old
watch
much
shillings
please
she
deposits
a
halfpenny
and
receives
four
shillings
together
with
a
ticket
now
for
albans
sam
sam
ay
well
might
he
turn
red
and
stutter
and
look
generally
foolish
when
that
quiet
little
girl
stood
before
him
in
his
at
the
hotel
her
words
were
as
quiet
as
her
look
write
her
a
letter
he
cries
you
shall
take
it
back
i
give
up
the
job
at
once
but
you
may
tell
her
i
up
to
no
harm
where
the
pen
where
the
cursed
ink
and
she
takes
the
letter
you
lost
a
day
work
jane
she
gave
you
the
money
for
the
journey
i
suppose
yes
of
course
her
she
not
to
make
a
fool
of
herself
in
future
i
sha
say
that
byass
but
i
to
say
it
to
someone
else
it
was
the
old
happy
smile
come
back
for
a
moment
the
voice
that
had
often
made
peace
so
merrily
the
return
journey
seemed
short
and
with
glad
she
hastened
from
the
city
to
hanover
street
well
well
of
course
it
would
all
begin
over
again
jane
herself
knew
it
but
is
not
all
life
a
struggle
onward
from
compromise
to
compromise
until
the
day
of
final
pacification
through
that
winter
she
lived
with
a
strange
secret
in
her
mind
a
secret
which
was
the
source
of
singularly
varied
feelings
of
astonishment
of
pain
of
encouragement
of
apprehension
of
grief
to
no
one
could
she
speak
of
it
no
one
could
divine
its
existence
no
one
save
the
person
to
whom
she
owed
this
surprising
novelty
in
her
experience
she
would
have
given
much
to
be
rid
of
it
and
yet
again
might
she
not
legitimately
accept
that
pleasure
which
at
times
came
of
the
thought
the
thought
that
as
a
woman
her
qualities
were
of
some
account
in
the
world
she
did
her
best
to
keep
it
out
of
her
consciousness
and
in
truth
had
so
many
other
things
to
think
about
that
it
was
seldom
she
really
had
trouble
with
it
life
was
not
altogether
easy
regular
work
was
not
always
to
be
kept
there
was
much
need
of
planning
and
pinching
that
her
independence
might
suffer
no
wound
bessie
byass
was
always
in
arms
against
that
same
independent
spirit
she
scoffed
at
it
assailed
it
with
treacherous
blandishment
made
direct
attacks
upon
it
must
live
in
my
own
way
byass
i
do
want
to
have
to
leave
you
and
if
ever
life
seemed
a
little
too
hard
if
the
image
of
the
past
grew
too
mournfully
persistent
she
knew
where
to
go
for
consolation
let
us
follow
her
one
saturday
afternoon
early
in
the
year
in
a
poor
street
in
clerkenwell
was
a
certain
poor
little
shop
built
out
as
an
afterthought
from
an
irregular
lump
of
houses
a
shop
with
a
room
behind
it
and
a
cellar
below
no
more
here
was
sold
clothing
women
and
children
no
name
over
the
front
but
neighbours
would
have
told
you
that
it
was
kept
by
one
todd
a
young
widow
with
several
children
todd
not
long
ago
used
to
have
only
a
stall
in
the
street
but
a
lady
named
miss
lant
helped
her
to
start
in
a
more
regular
way
of
business
does
she
carry
it
on
quite
by
herself
no
with
her
lived
another
young
woman
also
a
widow
who
had
one
child
hewett
her
name
she
did
sewing
in
the
room
behind
or
attended
to
the
shop
when
todd
was
away
making
purchases
there
jane
snowdon
entered
the
clothing
that
hung
in
the
window
made
it
very
dark
inside
she
had
to
peer
a
little
before
she
could
distinguish
the
person
who
sat
behind
the
counter
pennyloaf
in
mrs
todd
miss
will
you
walk
through
the
room
behind
is
lighted
from
the
ceiling
it
is
heaped
with
the
most
miscellaneous
clothing
it
contains
two
beds
some
shelves
with
crockery
a
table
some
chairs
but
it
would
have
taken
you
a
long
time
to
note
all
these
details
so
huddled
together
was
everything
part
of
the
general
huddling
were
five
children
of
various
ages
and
among
them
very
busy
sat
pennyloaf
going
on
well
was
jane
first
question
miss
i
know
it
is
whenever
you
call
me
miss
there
something
wrong
i
learnt
that
pennyloaf
smiled
sadly
but
with
affection
in
her
eyes
i
have
been
a
bit
low
an
that
the
truth
it
takes
me
sometimes
you
know
i
been
thinkin
when
i
ought
with
me
pennyloaf
we
ca
help
thinking
can
we
what
a
good
thing
if
we
nothing
more
to
think
about
than
these
children
little
bob
why
bob
i
thought
you
were
old
clothes
i
did
really
you
may
well
laugh
the
laughter
was
merry
and
jane
encouraged
it
inventing
all
sorts
of
foolish
jokes
i
wish
you
ask
me
to
stay
to
tea
that
i
will
miss
jane
an
gladly
would
you
like
it
soon
in
an
hour
will
do
wo
it
give
me
something
that
wants
sewing
a
really
hard
bit
something
that
break
needles
yes
that
do
where
todd
thimble
now
we
all
going
to
be
comfortable
and
we
have
a
good
talk
pennyloaf
found
the
dark
thoughts
slip
away
insensibly
and
she
talked
she
talked
where
was
there
such
a
talker
as
pennyloaf
nowadays
when
she
once
began
byass
was
not
very
willing
after
all
to
give
up
his
country
travelling
that
his
departure
on
that
business
befell
at
a
moment
of
domestic
quarrel
was
merely
chance
secretly
he
had
made
the
arrangement
with
his
firm
some
weeks
before
the
penitence
which
affected
him
upon
jane
appeal
could
not
be
of
abiding
result
for
like
all
married
men
at
a
certain
point
of
their
lives
he
felt
heartily
tired
of
home
and
wished
to
see
the
world
a
little
hanover
street
heard
endless
discussions
of
the
point
between
sam
and
bessie
between
bessie
and
jane
between
jane
and
sam
between
all
three
together
and
the
upshot
was
that
byass
gained
his
point
for
a
time
he
would
go
on
country
journeys
bessie
assented
sullenly
but
strange
to
say
she
had
never
been
in
better
spirits
than
on
the
day
after
this
decision
had
been
arrived
at
on
that
day
however
it
was
early
in
march
an
annoying
incident
happened
scawthorne
who
always
dined
in
town
and
seldom
returned
to
his
lodgings
till
late
in
the
evening
rang
his
bell
about
eight
and
sent
a
message
by
the
servant
that
he
wished
to
see
byass
bessie
having
come
up
he
announced
to
her
with
gravity
that
his
tenancy
of
the
rooms
would
be
at
an
end
in
a
fortnight
various
considerations
necessitated
his
livin
in
a
different
part
of
london
bessie
frankly
lamented
she
would
never
again
find
such
an
estimable
lodger
but
to
be
sure
scawthorne
had
prepared
her
for
this
three
months
ago
well
what
must
be
must
be
miss
snowdon
in
the
house
mrs
byass
scawthorne
went
on
to
inquire
snowdon
yes
letter
from
america
which
i
found
on
coming
in
contains
news
she
must
hear
disagreeable
news
i
sorry
to
say
her
father
bessie
inquired
anxiously
scawthorne
nodded
a
grave
and
confidential
affirmative
he
had
never
given
byass
reason
to
suppose
that
he
knew
anything
of
whereabouts
but
bessie
thoughts
naturally
turned
in
that
direction
news
comes
to
me
by
chance
he
continued
think
i
ought
to
communicate
it
to
miss
snowdon
privately
and
leave
her
to
let
you
know
what
it
is
as
doubtless
she
will
would
it
be
inconvenient
to
you
to
let
me
have
the
use
of
your
parlour
for
five
minutes
go
and
light
the
gas
at
once
and
tell
miss
snowdon
you
mrs
byass
he
was
nervous
a
most
unusual
thing
with
him
till
bessie
return
he
p
aced
the
room
irregularly
chewing
the
ends
of
his
moustache
when
it
was
announced
to
him
that
the
parlour
was
ready
he
went
down
the
letter
in
his
hand
at
the
door
came
a
soft
knock
jane
entered
she
showed
signs
of
painful
agitation
you
sit
down
miss
snowdon
it
happens
that
i
have
a
correspondent
in
the
united
states
who
has
lately
had
had
business
relations
with
joseph
snowdon
your
father
on
returning
this
evening
i
found
a
letter
from
my
friend
in
which
there
is
news
of
a
distressing
kind
he
paused
what
he
was
about
to
say
was
for
once
the
truth
the
letter
however
came
from
a
stranger
a
lawyer
in
chicago
father
i
understand
has
lately
been
engaged
in
in
commercial
speculation
on
a
great
scale
his
enterprises
have
proved
unfortunate
one
of
those
financial
crashes
which
are
common
in
america
caused
his
total
ruin
jane
drew
a
deep
breath
am
sorry
to
say
that
is
not
all
the
excitement
of
the
days
when
his
fate
was
hanging
in
the
balance
led
to
illness
fatal
illness
he
died
on
the
sixth
of
february
jane
with
her
eyes
bent
down
was
motionless
after
a
pause
scawthorne
continued
will
speak
of
this
with
percival
and
every
inquiry
shall
be
made
on
your
behalf
you
sir
she
rose
very
pale
but
with
more
than
on
entering
the
room
the
latter
part
of
his
communication
seemed
to
have
affected
her
as
a
relief
snowdon
if
you
would
allow
me
to
say
a
few
more
words
you
will
remember
i
mentioned
to
you
that
there
was
a
prospect
of
my
becoming
a
partner
in
the
firm
which
i
have
hitherto
served
as
clerk
a
certain
examination
had
to
be
passed
that
i
might
be
admitted
a
solicitor
that
is
over
in
a
few
days
my
position
as
a
member
of
the
firm
will
be
assured
jane
waited
her
eyes
still
cast
down
feel
that
it
may
seem
to
you
an
time
but
the
very
fact
that
i
have
just
been
the
bearer
of
such
sad
news
impels
me
to
speak
i
can
not
keep
the
promise
that
i
would
never
revive
the
subject
on
which
i
spoke
to
you
not
long
ago
forgive
me
i
ask
you
again
if
you
can
not
think
of
me
as
i
wish
miss
snowdon
will
you
let
me
devote
myself
to
making
your
life
happy
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
could
attain
a
position
such
as
i
now
have
there
would
be
little
else
to
ask
for
i
began
life
poor
and
and
you
can
not
imagine
the
difficulties
i
have
overcome
but
if
i
go
away
from
this
house
and
leave
you
so
lonely
living
such
a
hard
life
there
will
be
very
little
satisfaction
for
me
in
my
success
let
me
try
to
make
for
you
a
happiness
such
as
you
merit
it
may
seem
as
if
we
were
very
slightly
acquainted
but
i
know
you
well
enough
to
esteem
you
more
highly
than
any
women
i
ever
met
and
if
you
could
but
think
of
me
he
was
sincere
jane
had
brought
out
the
best
in
him
with
the
death
of
snowdon
all
his
disreputable
past
seemed
swept
away
and
he
had
no
thought
of
anything
but
a
decent
rectitude
a
cleanly
enjoyment
of
existence
for
the
future
but
jane
was
answering
ca
change
what
i
said
before
scawthorne
i
am
very
content
to
live
as
i
do
now
i
have
friends
i
am
very
fond
of
thank
you
for
your
kindness
but
i
ca
change
without
intending
it
she
ceased
upon
a
word
which
to
her
hearer
conveyed
a
twofold
meaning
he
understood
offer
what
he
might
it
could
not
tempt
her
to
forget
the
love
which
had
been
the
best
part
of
her
life
she
was
faithful
to
the
past
and
unchanging
byass
never
suspected
the
second
purpose
for
which
her
lodger
had
desired
to
speak
with
jane
this
evening
scawthorne
in
due
time
took
his
departure
with
many
expressions
of
goodwill
many
assurances
that
nothing
could
please
him
better
than
to
be
of
service
to
bessie
and
her
husband
wished
me
to
say
to
you
for
him
said
bessie
when
jane
came
back
from
her
work
so
the
romance
in
her
life
was
over
michael
snowdon
wealth
had
melted
away
with
it
was
gone
for
ever
the
hope
of
realising
his
high
projects
all
passed
into
the
world
of
memory
of
dream
all
save
the
spirit
which
had
ennobled
him
the
generous
purpose
bequeathed
to
those
two
hearts
which
had
loved
him
best
to
his
memory
all
days
were
sacred
but
one
that
of
his
burial
marked
itself
for
jane
as
the
point
in
each
year
to
which
her
life
was
directed
the
saddest
yet
bringing
with
it
her
supreme
solace
a
day
in
early
spring
cloudy
cold
she
left
the
workroom
in
the
and
did
not
return
but
instead
of
going
to
hanover
street
she
walked
past
islington
green
all
along
essex
road
northward
thence
to
stoke
newington
and
so
came
to
abney
park
cemetery
a
long
way
but
it
did
not
weary
her
in
the
cemetery
she
turned
her
steps
to
a
grave
with
a
plain
headstone
before
leaving
england
joseph
snowdon
had
discharged
this
duty
the
inscription
was
simply
a
name
with
dates
of
birth
looked
at
himand
death
and
as
she
stood
there
other
footsteps
approached
the
spot
she
looked
up
with
no
surprise
and
gave
her
hand
for
a
moment
on
the
first
anniversary
the
meeting
had
been
unanticipated
the
same
thought
led
her
and
sidney
to
the
cemetery
at
the
same
hour
this
was
the
third
year
and
they
met
as
if
by
understanding
though
neither
had
spoken
of
it
when
they
had
stood
in
silence
for
a
while
jane
told
of
her
death
and
its
circumstances
she
told
him
too
of
pennyloaf
humble
security
have
kept
well
all
the
year
he
asked
you
too
i
hope
then
they
bade
each
other
in
each
life
little
for
congratulation
he
with
the
ambitions
of
his
youth
frustrated
neither
an
artist
nor
a
leader
of
men
in
the
battle
for
justice
she
no
saviour
of
society
by
the
force
of
a
superb
example
no
daughter
of
the
people
holding
wealth
in
trust
for
the
people
needs
yet
to
both
was
their
work
given
unmarked
unencouraged
save
by
their
love
of
uprightness
and
mercy
they
stood
by
the
side
of
those
more
hapless
brought
some
comfort
to
hearts
less
courageous
than
their
own
where
they
abode
it
was
not
all
dark
sorrow
certainly
awaited
them
perchance
defeat
in
even
the
humble
aims
that
they
had
set
themselves
but
at
least
their
lives
would
remain
a
protest
against
those
brute
forces
of
society
which
fill
with
wreck
the
abysses
of
the
nether
world
