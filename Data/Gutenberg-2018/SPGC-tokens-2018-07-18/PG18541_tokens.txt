was
on

of

that

sailed
from

for
montevideo
the
capital
o
uruguay
the
strip
of

bounding
the
river

on

and
called
by

natives
banda

the
was
a
trim
and
tidy
craft
of
tons
register
hailing
from
baltimore
the
port
noted
for
clippers
and
being
herself
high
famed
above
them
all
for
swift
sailing
she
had
won
admiration
on
many
seas
her
crew

all
told
twelve
had
been
the
complement
when
freights
were
good
there
were
beside
the
crew
with
regular
stations
a
little
lad
aged
about
six
years
and
his
mamma

privileged
above
the

the
mate
victor
who
is
to
see
many
adventures
before
reaching
new
york
again
was
born
and
bred
on
shipboard
he
was
in
perfect
health
and
as
strong
as
a
windlass
when
he
first
saw
the
light
and
began
to
give
orders
he
was
at
san
francisco
on
the
packet
the
vessel
lost
in
the
tempest
at
samoa
just
before
the
great
naval
disaster
at
the
same
place
in
the
year
of
garfield
the
little
lad
above
mentioned
victor
brother
in
this
family
ship
was
born
in
hong
kong
harbour
in
the
old
bark
a
american
citizen
though
first
seeing
the
light
in
a
foreign
port
the
stars
and
stripes
standing
sponsors
for
his
nationality
this
bark
had
braved
the
wind
and
waves
for
years
but
had
not
up
to
that
date
so
far
as
i
know
experienced
so
lively
a
breeze
as
the
one
which
sprung
up
about
her
old
timbers
on
that
eventful
of
march
our
foremast
hands
on
the
six
in
number
were
from
as
many
nations
strangers
to
me
and
strangers
to
each
other
but
the
cook
a
negro
was
a
native
american
to
the
manner
born
to
have
even
so
many
americans
in
one
ship
was
considered
exceptional
much
or
little
as
matters
this
family
history
and
description
of
the
crew
the
day
of
our
sailing
was
and
stormy
boding
no
good
for
the
coming
voyage
which
was
to
be
indeed
the
most
eventful
of
my
life
of
more
than
years
at
sea
studying
the
morning
weather
report
before
sailing
we
saw
predicted
a
gale
from
the
and
one
also
approaching
from
the
at
the
same
time
the
prospect
said
the
new
york
papers
is
not
encouraging
we
were
anxious
however
to
commence
the
voyage
having
a
crew
on
board
and
being
all
ready
we
boldly
sailed
somewhat
against
our
better
judgment
the
blowing
at
the
time
at
the
rate
of
forty
miles
an
hour
increased
to
eighty
or
ninety
miles
by
march
this
hurricane
continued
through
march
and
gave
us
serious
concern
for
the
ship
and
all
on
board
at
new
york
on
those
days
the
wind
howled
from
the
north
with
the
storm
centre
somewhere
on
the
atlantic
so
said
the
wise
seamen
of
the
weather
bureau
to
whom
by
the
way
the
real
old
salt
is
indebted
at
the
present
day
for
information
of
approaching
storms
sometimes
days
ahead
the
prognostication
was
correct
as
we
can
testify
for
out
on
the
atlantic
our
bark
could
carry
only
a
mere
rag
of
a
foresail
somewhat
larger
than
a
and
with
this
she
went
flying
before
the
tempest
all
those
dark
days
with
a
large
bone
in
her
mouth
making
great
headway
even
under
the
small
sail
mountains
of
seas
swept
clean
over
the
bark
in
their
mad
race
filling
her
decks
full
to
the
top
of
the
bulwarks
and
shaking
things
generally
our
men
were
lashed
each
one
to
his
station
and
all
spare
spars
not
doubly
lashed
were
washed
away
along
with
other
movables
that
were
broken
and
torn
from
their
fastenings
by
the
wild
storm
the
cook
galley
came
in
for
its
share
of
the
damage
the
cook
himself
barely
escaping
serious
injury
from
a
sea
that
went
thundering
across
the
decks
taking
with
it
doors
windows
galley
stove
pots
kettles
and
all
together
with
the
culinary
artist
landing
the
whole
wreck
in
the
lee
scuppers
but
most
fortunately
with
the
professor
on
top
a
misfortune
like
this
is
always
felt
it
dampens
one
feelings
so
to
speak
it
means
cold
food
for
a
time
to
come
if
not
even
worse
fare
the
day
following
our
misfortune
however
was
not
so
bad
in
fact
the
tremendous
seas
boarding
the
bark
latterly
were
indications
of
the
good
change
coming
for
it
meant
that
her
speed
had
slackened
through
a
lull
of
the
gale
allowing
the
seas
to
reach
her
too
full
and
heavy
more
sail
was
at
once
crowded
on
and
still
more
was
set
at
every
stage
of
the
abatement
of
the
gale
for
the
craft
should
not
be
lazy
when
big
seas
race
after
her
and
so
on
we
flew
like
a
scud
sheeting
home
sail
after
sail
as
required
till
the
of
march
when
all
of
her
white
wings
were
spread
and
she
fairly
walked
the
waters
like
a
thing
of
life
there
was
now
wind
enough
for
several
days
but
not
too
much
and
our
craft
laughed
at
the
seas
trying
to
catch
her
cheerily
on
we
sailed
for
days
and
days
pressed
by
the
favouring
gale
meeting
the
sun
each
day
a
long
span
earlier
making
daily
four
degrees
of
longitude
it
was
the
time
on
these
bright
days
to
forearm
with
dry
clothing
against
future
stormy
weather
boxes
and
bags
were
brought
on
deck
and
drying
and
patching
went
on
by
wholesale
in
the
watch
below
while
the
watch
on
deck
bestirred
themselves
putting
the
ship
in
order
chips
the
carpenter
mended
the
galley
the
cook
broken
shins
were
plastered
up
and
in
a
few
days
all
was
well
again
and
the
sailors
moving
cheerfully
about
once
more
in
their
patched
garments
of
varied
hues
reminded
me
of
the
spotted
cape
pigeons
pecking
for
a
living
the
pigeons
i
imagined
having
a
better
life
of
the
two
a
panican
of
hot
coffee
or
tea
by
sailors
called
water
bewitched
a
and
bit
of
had
regaled
the
crew
and
restored
their
voices
then
reuben
ranzo
was
heard
on
the
breeze
and
the
main
tack
was
boarded
to
the
tune
of
johnny
boker
other
wondrous
songs
through
the
could
be
heard
in
keeping
with
the
happy
time
then
what
they
would
do
and
what
they
would
do
in
the
next
port
was
talked
of
when
song
and
yarn
ran
out
hold
fast
shipmate
hold
fast
and
belay
or
the
crimps
of
montevideo
will
wear
the
new
jacket
you
promise
yourself
while
you
will
be
off
cape
horn
singing
haul
out
to
leeward
with
a
wet
stocking
on
your
neck
and
with
the
same
old
lamby
on
that
long
since
was
lamby
only
in
name
the
woolly
part
having
given
way
to
a
cloth
worn
much
in
far
cathay
in
short
you
will
dress
in
dungaree
the
same
as
now
while
the
crimps
and
landsharks
divide
your
scanty
earnings
unless
you
take
in
the
slack
of
your
feelings
and
make
all
fast
and
steady
all
ten
days
out
and
we
were
in
the
northeast
trades
porpoises
were
playing
under
the
bows
as
only
porpoises
can
play
dolphins
were
racing
alongside
and
were
all
about
this
was
indeed
a
happy
change
and
like
being
transported
to
another
world
our
hardships
were
now
all
forgotten
for
the
sea
washes
off
all
the
woes
of
men
one
week
more
of
pleasant
sailing
all
going
orderly
on
board
and
cape
verde
islands
came
in
sight
a
grand
and
glorious
sight
they
were
all
hail
it
is
good
to
look
at
you
once
again
by
noon
the
islands
were
abeam
and
the
fresh
in
the
evening
bore
us
out
of
sight
of
them
before
dark
most
delightful
sailing
is
this
large
swinging
motion
of
our
bark
bounding
over
the
waves
with
the
gale
abaft
the
beam
driving
her
forward
till
she
fairly
leaps
from
billow
to
billow
as
if
trying
to
rival
her
companions
the
very
thwarted
now
by
a
sea
she
strikes
it
with
her
handsome
bows
sending
into
the
light
countless
thousand
sprays
that
shine
like
a
nimbus
of
glory
the
tread
on
her
is
lighter
now
and
the
little
world
afloat
is
gladsome
fore
and
aft
cape
frio
cold
cape
was
the
next
landfall
upon
reaching
that
point
we
had
crossed
the
atlantic
twice
the
course
toward
cape
verde
islands
had
been
taken
to
avail
ourselves
of
a
leading
wind
through
the
trades
the
course
from
the
islands
to
frio
being
southwesterly
this
latter
stretch
was
spanned
on
an
easy
with
nothing
eventful
to
record
thence
our
course
was
through
variable
winds
to
the
river
plate
where
a
was
experienced
that
blew
great
guns
and
whistled
a
hornpipe
through
the
rigging
these
winds
from
the
usually
blow
with
great
fury
but
give
ample
warning
of
their
approach
the
first
sign
being
a
spell
of
unsurpassed
fine
weather
with
small
fleecy
clouds
floating
so
gently
in
the
sky
that
one
scarcely
perceives
their
movements
yet
they
do
move
like
an
immense
herd
of
sheep
grazing
undisturbed
on
the
great
azure
field
all
this
we
witnessed
and
took
into
account
then
gradually
and
without
any
apparent
cause
the
clouds
began
to
huddle
together
in
large
groups
a
sign
had
been
given
which
the
elements
recognized
next
came
a
flash
of
fire
from
behind
the
accumulating
masses
then
a
distant
rumbling
noise
it
was
a
note
of
warning
and
one
that
no
vessel
should
let
pass
unheeded
clew
up
and
furl
was
the
order
to
hand
all
sail
when
these
fierce
visitors
are
out
on
a
frolic
over
the
seas
and
entertain
them
under
bare
poles
is
the
safest
plan
unless
indeed
the
best
storm
sails
are
bent
even
then
it
is
safest
to
the
before
the
gale
comes
on
not
till
the
fury
of
the
blast
is
spent
does
the
ship
require
sail
for
it
is
not
till
then
that
the
sea
begins
to
rise
necessitating
sail
to
steady
her
the
first
onslaught
of
the
storm
levelling
all
before
it
and
sending
the
waves
flying
across
in
sheets
sailor
sheets
so
to
speak
lends
a
wild
and
fearful
aspect
but
there
is
no
dread
of
a
in
the
sailor
heart
at
these
times
for
the
gale
is
from
off
the
land
as
indicated
by
the
name
it
bears
after
the
gale
was
a
calm
following
which
came
desirable
winds
that
carried
us
at
last
to
the
port
we
sought
montevideo
where
we
cast
anchor
on
the
of
may
and
made
preparations
after
the
visit
for
discharging
the
cargo
which
was
finally
taken
into
lighters
from
alongside
to
the
piers
and
thence
to
the
warehouses
where
ends
the
ship
responsibility
to
the
owner
of
the
goods
but
not
till
then
ceases
the
ship
liability
or
the
captain
care
of
the
merchandise
placed
in
his
trust
clearly
the
captain
has
cares
on
sea
and
on
land

the
fairer
of

for
a
cargo
of
maté
a
sort
of
tea
which
prepared
as
a
drink
is
wholesome
and
refreshing
it
is
partaken
of
by
the
natives
in
a
highly
sociable
manner
through
a
tube
which
is
thrust
into

steaming
beverage
in
a

urn

whichever
may
happen
to
be
at

when

neebors
meet

all
sip

which
is

from

no
matter
how
many

there
may
be
the
as
it
is
called

reach

too
when
the
company
is
large
this
is
done
with
but
little
loss
of
time
by
thrusting
into
the
urn
or
gourd
a
spoonful
of
the
herb
and
two
spoonfuls
of
sugar
to
a

of
water
which
is
poured
boiling
over
it
the

is
made

to
give
it

a

is
plunged

then
it

it

happy
is
he
if
a
stranger
who
gets
the
first
sip
at
the
tube
but
the
initiated
have
no
prejudices
while
in
that
country
i
frequently
joined
in
the
social
rounds
at
maté
and
finally
rejoiced
in
a
of
my
own
the
people
at
antonina
in
fact
all
the
people
we
saw
in
brazil
were
kind
extremely
hospitable
and
polite
living
in
thrift
generally
their
wants
were
but
few
beyond
their
resources
the
mountain
scenery
viewed
from
the
harbour
of

is
something
to
gloat
over
i
have
seen
no

in
the

more
truly
grand
and
pleasing

climate
too
is
perfect
and

only
doctor
of
the

when
we
were
there
wore
a

out
at
the
elbows
for
lack
of
patronage
a
desirable
port
is
antonina
we
had
musical
entertainments
on
board
at
this
place
to
see
the
display
of
beautiful
white
teeth
by
these
brazilian
sweet
singers
was
good
to
the
soul
of
a
mariner
one
nymph
sang
for
the
writer
benefit
a
song
at
which
they
all
laughed
very
much
being
in
native
dialect
i
did
not
understand
it
but
of
course
laughed
with
the
rest
at
which
they
were
convulsed
from
this
i
supposed
it
to
be
at
my
expense
i
enjoyed
that
too
as
much
or
more
than
i
would
have
relished
in
my
favour
with
maté
we
came
to
buenos
aires
where
the
process
of
discharging
the
cargo
was
the
same
as
at
montevideo
into
lighters
but
at
buenos
aires
we
lay
four
times
the
distance
from
the
shore
about
four
miles
the
herb
or
is
packed
into
barrels
boxes
and
into
sacks
which
are
sewed
up
with
stout
hide
thongs
the
contents
pressed
in
tightly
when
the
hide
is
green
and
elastic
becomes
as
hard
as
a
by
the
contraction
which
follows
when
it
dries
the
first
load
of
the
that
came
off
to
the
bark
at
the
port
of
loading
was
espied
on
the
way
by
little
garfield
piled
in
the

high
above
the
gunwales
the
hairy
side

they
did
look
odd

from

we
proceeded
up
the
river
plate
near
the
confluence
of
the
parana
and
paraguay
to
salve
a
cargo
of
wine
from
the
stranded
brig
san
from
marseilles
the
current
of
the
great
river
at
that
point
runs
constantly
seaward
becoming
almost
a
sea
of
itself
and
a
dangerous
one
to
navigate
hence
the
loss
of
the
pascual
and
many
others
before
her
if
like
the
ancient
mariner
we
had
any
of
us
cried
water
water
all
around
and
not
a
drop
to
drink
we
forgot
it
now
in
this
bountiful
stream

we
had
without
stint
the
insurance
agent
to
leave
no
excuse
for
tampering
with
the
cargo
rolled
out
a
cask
of
the
best
and
like
a
true
hans
breitmann
knocked
out
der
bung
then
too
cases
were
broken
in
the
handling
the
contents
of
which
drenched
their
clothes
from
top
to

as
the
sailors
carried
them
away
on
their
heads
the

of
a
sailor
life
ah
me
the
experience
of
dana
and
his
shipmates
for

on
a
coast
carrying
dry
hides
on
their
heads
if
not
a
worse
one
may
be
in

cried
now
fairly
swimming
in
luxuries
water
and
wine
alike
free
although
our
present
good
luck
may
be
followed
by
times
less
cheerful
we
preferred
to
count
this
we
said
as
compensation
for
past
misfortunes
marking
well
that
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
the
cargo
of
wine
in
due
course
was
landed
at
rosario
with
but
small
loss
the
crew
except
in
one
case
remaining
sober
enough
to
help
navigate
even
the
difficult
parana
but
one
old
sinner
the
case
i
speak
of
an
old
labrador
fisherman
became
a
useless
drunken
swab
in
spite
of
all
we
could
do
i
say
we
for
most
of
the
crew
were
on
my
side
in
favour
of
a
fair
deal
and
regular
supplies
the
hold
was
barred
and
locked
and
every
place
we
could
think
of
for
a
time
was
searched
still
dan
kept
terribly
drunk
at
last
his
mattress
was
turned
out
and
from
it
rolled
a
dozen
or
more
bottles
of
the
best
liquor
then
there
was
a
row
but
all
on
the
part
of
dan
who
swore
blue
vengeance
on
the
man
if
he
could
but
find
him
out
who
had
stowed
that
grog
in
his
bunk
trying
to
get
him
into
trouble
some
of
those
young
fellows
would
rue
it
yet
the
cargo
of
wine
being
discharged
i
chartered
to
load
alfalfa
packed
in
bales
for
rio
many
deaths
had
occurred
about
this
time
with
appalling
suddenness
we
soon
learned
that
cholera
was
staring
us
all
in
the
face
and
that
it
was
fast
spreading
through
the
country
filling
towns
and
cities
with
sickness
and
death
approaching
more
frightfully
near
it
carried
our
pilot
over
the
bar
his
wife
was
a
widow
the
day
after
he
brought
our
bark
to
the
loading
berth
and
the
young
man
who
commenced
to
deliver
us
the
cargo
was
himself
measured
the
day
after
his
ship
had
come
in
many
stout
men
and
many
many
women
and
children
succumbed
to
the
scourge
yet
it
was
our
high
privilege
to
come
through
the
dark
cloud
without
losing
a
loved
one
while
thousands
were
cast
down
with
bereavements
and
grief
at
one
time
it
appeared
that
we
were
in
the
centre
of
the
cloud
which
its
ugly
body
through
districts
poisoning
all
that
it
touched
and
leaving
death
in
its
wake
this
was
indeed
cholera
in
its
most
terrible
form
one
poor
fellow
sat
at
the
widow
lacinas
hotel
bewildered
hours
ago
said
he
i
sat
at
my
own
hearth
with
wife
and
three
children
by
my
side
now
i
am
alone
in
the
world
even
my
poor
house
such
as
it
was
is
pulled
down
this
man
i
say
had
troubles
surely
was
his
house
pulled
down
there
was
no
escaping
the
poison
or
keeping
it
off
except
by
disinfectants
and
by
keeping
the
system
regular
for
it
soon
spread
over
all
the
land
and
the
air
was
full
of
it
remedies
sold
so
high
that
many
must
have
perished
without
the
test
of
medicinal
aid
to
cure
their
disease
a
cry
went
up
against
unprincipled
druggists
who
were
for
their
drugs
but
nothing
more
was
done
to
check
their
greed
camphor
sold
as
high
as
four
dollars
a
pound
and
the
druggist
with
a
few
hundred
drops
of
laudanum
and
as
much
chlorodyne
could
travel
through
europe
afterward
on
the
profits
of
his
sales
it
was
at
rosario
and
at
this
time
that
we
buried
our
young
friend
captain
speck
well
loved
of
young
and
old
his
friends
did
not
ask
whether
it
was
cholera
or
not
that
he
died
of
but
performed
the
last
act
of
friendship
as
became
men
of
heart
and
feeling
the
minister
could
not
come
that
day
but
captain
speck
little
friend
garfield
said
the
flags
were
set
for
the
angels
to
come
and
take
the
captain
to
heaven
need
more
be
said
and
the
flags
blew
out
all
day
then
it
became
us
to
erect
a
memorial
slab
and
hardest
of
all
to
write
to
the
widow
and
orphans
this
was
done
in
a
homely
way
but
with
sympathetic
aching
hearts
away
off
there
in
santa
fè
our
time
at
rosario
after
this
was
spent
in
gloomy
days
that
dragged
into
weeks
and
months
and
our
thoughts
often
wandered
from
there
to
a
happy
past
we
preferred
to
dwell
away
from
there
and
in
other
climes
if
only
in
thought
there
was
however
one
happy
soul
among
us
the
child
whose
face
was
a
sunbeam
in
all
kinds
of
weather
and
at
all
times
happy
in
his
ignorance
of
the
evils
that
fall
to
the
lot
of
man
our
from
rosario
finally
came
and
with
a
feeling
as
of
casting
off
fetters
the
lines
were
let
go
and
the
bark
hauled
out
into
the
stream
with
a
full
cargo
on
board
but
instead
of
sailing
for
rio
as
per
charter
she
was
ordered
by
the
brazilian
consul
to
ilha
grande
great
island
the
quarantine
station
of
brazil
some
miles
west
of
rio
there
to
be
disinfected
and
to
discharge
her
cargo
in
quarantine
a
new
crew
was
shipped
and
put
aboard
but
while
i
was
getting
my
papers
about
noon
they
stole
one
of
the
ship
boats
and
scurried
off
down
the
river
as
fast
no
doubt
as
they
could
go
i
have
not
seen
them
or
my
boat
since
they
all
deserted
every
mother
son
of
them
taking
beside
the
boat
a
month
advance
pay
from
a
dutch
harry
a
sailor
who
had
stolen
my
inward
crew
that
he
might
as
he
boasted
afterward
ship
new
hands
in
their
places
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
vilest
of
crimps
was
the
loser
of
the
money
i
could
almost
forgive
the
galoots
for
the
theft
of
my
boat
the
ship
is
usually
responsible
for
advance
wages
hours
after
she
has
sailed
providing
too
that
the
sailors
proceed
to
sea
in
her
seeing
moreover
that
they
were
of
that
stripe
unworthy
the
name
of
sailor
my
vessel
was
the
better
without
them
by
at
least
what
it
cost
to
be
rid
of
them
namely
the
price
of
my
boat
however
i
will
take
back
what
i
said
about
dutch
harry
being
the
vilest
crimp
there
came
one
to
rosario
worse
than
he
one
pete
the
greek
who
cut
off
the
ears
of
a
rival
at
the
boca
threw
them
into
the
river
then
making
his
escape
to
rosario
some
miles
away
established
himself
in
the
business
in
opposition
to
the
dutchman
whom
he
shanghaied
soon
after
then
reigned
peacefully
in
his
stead
a
captain
who
like
myself
had
suffered
from
the
depredations
of
this
noted
gentry
told
me
in
great
glee
that
he
saw
harry
on
a
italian
bark
outward
bound
even
then
nearly
out
of
the
river
the
last
seen
of
him
by
my
friend
the
captain
was
among
the
branches
with
a
rope
around
his
neck
they
hanged
him
maybe
i
do
know
what
else
the
rope
was
for
or
who
deserved
more
to
be
hanged
the
captain
screamed
with
delight
he
get
bone
soup
at
least
for
a
while
instead
of
santa
fè
good
at
our
expense
my
second
crew
was
furnished
by
pete
before
referred
to
and
on
the
seventeenth
of
december
we
set
sail
from
that
country
of
revolutions
things
soon
dropped
into
working
order
and
i
found
reason
to
be
pleased
with
the
change
of
crew
we
glided
smoothly
along
down
the
river
thence
wishing
never
again
to
see
rosario
under
the
distressing
circumstances
through
which
she
had
just
passed
on
the
following
day
while
slipping
along
before
a
light
rippling
breeze
a
dog
was
espied
out
in
the
current
struggling
in
the
whirlpools
which
were
rather
strong
apparently
unable
to
extricate
himself
and
was
greatly
exhausted
coming
up
with
him
our
was
laid
to
the
mast
and
as
we
ranged
by
the
poor
thing
a
sailor
plunging
over
the
side
in
a
bent
a
rope
on
to
doggy
another
one
hauled
him
carefully
on
board
and
the
rescue
was
made
he
proved
to
be
a
fine
young
retriever
and
his
intelligent
signs
of
thankfulness
for
his
escape
from
drowning
were
scarcely
less
eloquent
of
gratitude
than
human
spoken
language
this
pleasant
incident
happening
on
a
friday
suggested
of
course
the
name
we
should
give
him
his
new
master
to
be
sure
was
garfield
who
at
once
said
i
guess
they
wo
know
me
when
i
get
home
with
my
new
suit
and
a
dog
the
two
romped
the
decks
thenceforth
early
and
late
it
was
good
to
see
them
romp
while
friday
barkit
wi
joy
our
pets
were
becoming
numerous
now
and
all
seemed
happy
till
a
stowaway
cat
one
day
killed
poor
little
pete
our
canary
for
ten
years
or
more
we
had
listened
to
the
notes
of
this
wee
bird
in
many
countries
and
climes
sweetest
of
sweet
singers
it
was
buried
in
the
great
atlantic
at
last
a
strange
cat
a
careless
steward
and
its
tiny
life
was
ended
and
the
tragedy
told
this
was
indeed
a
great
loss
to
us
all
and
was
mourned
over
almost
as
the
loss
of
a
child
a
book
that
has
been
read
at
sea
has
a
near
claim
on
our
friendship
and
is
a
thing
one
is
loth
to
part
with
or
change
even
for
a
better
book
but
the
friend
of
many
voyages
is
oh
so
hard
to
part
with
at
sea
a
in
the
solemn
sea
of
sameness
in
the
trackless
ocean
marked
only
by
imaginary
lines
and
circles
is
a
cheerless
spot
to
look
to
yet
how
many
have
treasures
there
returning
to
the
voyage
and
journal
our
pilot
proved
incompetent
and
we
narrowly
escaped
shipwreck
in
consequence
at
martin
garcia
bar
a
bad
spot
in
the
river
plate
a
small
schooner
captain
observing
that
we
needlessly
followed
in
his
track
and
being
anything
but
a
sailor
in
principle
wantonly
meditated
mischief
to
us
while
i
was
confidently
trusting
to
my
pilot
and
he
the
pilot
trusting
to
the
schooner
one
that
could
go
over
banks
where
we
would
strike
what
did
the
scamp
do
but
shave
close
to
a
dangerous
spot
my
pilot
following
faithfully
in
his
wake
then
jumping
upon
the
taffrail
of
his
craft
as
we
came
abreast
the
shoal
he
yelled
like
a
comanche
to
my
pilot
to
port
the
helm
and
what
does
my
jackass
do
but
port
hard
over
the
bark
of
course
brought
up
immediately
on
the
ground
as
the
other
had
planned
seeing
which
his
whole
pirate
crew
they
could
have
been
little
less
than
pirates
joined
in
roars
of
laughter
but
sailed
on
doing
us
no
other
harm
by
our
utmost
exertions
the
bark
was
gotten
off
not
a
moment
too
soon
however
for
by
the
time
we
kedged
her
into
deep
water
a
was
upon
us
she
rode
out
the
gale
safe
at
anchor
thanks
to
an
active
crew
our
water
tanks
and
casks
were
then
refilled
having
been
emptied
to
lighten
the
bark
from
her
perilous
position
next
evening
the
storm
went
down
and
by
mutual
consent
our
left
taking
passage
in
a
passing
with
his
pay
and
our
best
advice
which
was
to
ship
in
a
where
his
capabilities
would
be
appreciated
then
paddling
our
own
canoe
without
further
accident
we
reached
the
passing
it
on
christmas
day
clearing
thence
before
night
english
bank
and
all
other
dangers
of
the
land
we
set
our
course
for
ilha
grande
the
wind
being
fair
then
a
sigh
of
relief
was
breathed
by
all
on
board
if
ever
old
briny
was
welcomed
it
was
on
that
christmas
day
nothing
further
of
interest
occurred
on
the
voyage
to
brazil
except
the
death
of
the
little
bird
already
spoken
of
which
loss
deeply
affected
us
all
we
arrived
at
ilha
grande
our
destination
on
the
day
of
january
and
came
to
anchor
in
nine
fathoms
of
water
at
about
noon
within
of
the
and
within
speaking
distance
of
several
vessels
riding
quarantine
with
more
or
less
communication
going
on
among
them
all
through
flags
several
ships
chafing
under
the
restraint

were
firing
signals
at
the
one
scandinavian
i
remember
asked
if
he
might
be
permitted
to
communicate
by
with
his
owners
in
christiana
the
guard
gave
him
as
the
irishman
said
an
evasive
answer
so
the
cablegram
i
suppose
laid
over
another
wanted
police
assistance
a
third
wished
to
know
if
he
could
get
fresh
provisions
ten
milreis
worth
he
was
a
german
naming
a
dozen
or
more
articles
that
he
wished
for
and
balance
in
altogether
the
young
fellows
on
the
were
having
one
might
say
a
signal
practice
on
the
next
day
january
the
officers
of
the
port
came
alongside
in
a
and
ordered
us
to
leave
saying
the
port
had
been
closed
that
morning
but
we
have
made
the
voyage
i
said
no
matter
said
the
guard
leave
at
once
you
must
or
the
will
fire
into
you
this
i
submit
was
harsh
and
arbitrary
treatment
a
thunderbolt
from
a
clear
sky
could
not
have
surprised
us
more
or
worked
us
much
greater
harm
to
be
ruined
in
business
or
struck
by
lightning
being
equally
bad
then
pointing
something
like
a
gun
dom
pedro
said
said
he
hence
begone
or
you
give
us
cholera
so
back
we
had
to
go
all
the
way
to
rosario
with
that
load
of
hay
and
trouble
but
on
our
arrival
there
we
found
things
better
than
they
were
when
we
sailed
the
cholera
had
ceased
it
was
on
the
wane
when
we
sailed
from
rosario
and
there
was
hardly
a
case
of
the
dread
disease
in
the
whole
country
east
of
cordova
when
we
returned
that
was
indeed
a
comfort
but
it
left
our
hardship
the
same
and
led
consequently
to
the
total
loss
of
the
vessel
after
dragging
us
through
harrowing
trials
and
losses
as
will
be
seen
by
subsequent
events

again
challenged
rio
at
last
this
ilha
grande
decree
really
a
political
movement
brought
great
hardships
on
us
notwithstanding
that
it
was
merely
intended
by
the
brazilians
as
retaliation
for
past
offences
by
their
argentine
neighbours
not
only
for
quarantines
against
rio
fevers
but
for
a
discriminating
duty
as
well
on
sugar
from
the
empire
a
combination
of
hardships
on
commerce
more
than
the
sensitive
brazilians
could
stand
so
chafing
them
that
a
retaliation
fever
sprung
up
reaching
more
than
the
heat
of
and
they
decided
to
teach
their
republican
cousins
a
wholesome
lesson
however
their
wish
was
to
retaliate
without
causing
war
and
it
was
done
in
fact
closing
ports
as
they
did
at
the
beginning
of
argentine
most
valuable
season
of
exports
to
brazil
and
with
the
plausible
excuse
namely
fear
of
pain
in
the
stomach
so
filled
the
argentines
with
admiration
of
their
equals
in
strategy
that
they
on
the
earliest
opportunity
proclaimed
two
public
holidays
in
honour
of
bright
brazil
so
the
matter
of
difference
ended
to
the
delight
of
all
in
and
champagne
to
the
delight
of
all
except
the
owner
and
crew
of
the
for
our
bark
there
was
no
way
but
to
return
where
the
cargo
came
from
at
a
ruinous
loss
too
of
time
and
money
we
called
at
the
first
open
port
and
wired
to
the
owner
of
the
cargo
but
got
no
answer
thence
we
sailed
to
buenos
aires
where
i
telegraphed
again
for
instructions
the
officers
of
the
upon
receiving
my
report
from
brazil
were
convulsed
with
laughter
while
i
i
confess
it
could
not
see
the
joke
after
waiting
two
days
this
diplomatic
reply
came
from
the
owner
of
the
cargo
act
as
the
case
may
require
upon
this
matter
i
had
several
opinions
one
person
suggested
that
the
case
required
me
to
pitch
the
whole
cargo
into
the
sea
this
friend
i
may
mention
was
from
boston
i
have
ever
since
regretted
however
that
i
did
not
take
his
advice
there
seemed
to
be
no
protection
for
the
vessel
the
law
that
a
ship
must
be
allowed
to
live
was
unheeded
in
fact
this
law
was
reversed
and
there
were
sharpers
and
at
every
turn
ready
to
take
advantage
of
one
misfortunes
or
even
drive
one
to
despair
i
concluded
finally
to
shake
the
lot
of
them
and
proceeding
up
the
parana
moored
again
at
the
berth
where
a
few
weeks
before
we
had
taken
in
the
cargo
spans
and
tackle
were
rigged
and
all
was
made
ready
to
discharge
it
was
now
come
on
mccarthy
or
mccarthy
come
on
i
did
care
which
i
had
one
on
my
side
and
i
kept
that
always
in
view
namely
the
right
to
discharge
the
cargo
where
i
had
first
received
it
but
where
the
money
to
buy
ballast
and
pay
other
charges
was
to
come
from
i
could
not
discover
my
merchant
met
me
in
great
concern
at
my
misfortunes
but
carramba
zounds
said
he
my
own
losses
are
great
it
required
very
little
reasoning
to
show
me
that
the
least
expensive
course
was
the
safest
one
for
me
to
adopt
and
my
merchant
offering
enough
to
pay
the
marketing
i
found
it
wisest
not
to
disturb
the
cargo
but
to
lay
up
instead
with
it
in
the
vessel
and
await
the
reopening
of
the
brazilian
ports
this
i
did
my
merchant
don
manuel
is
said
to
be
worth
millions
of
the
foundation
of
his
wealth
was
laid
by
peddling
charcoal
carrying
it
at
first
to
his
credit
be
it
said
on
his
back
and
he
was
then
a
good
fellow
many
a
hard
bargain
has
he
waged
since
and
is
now
a
don
living
in
a
house
the
don
does
peddle
charcoal
any
more
moored
at
rosario
waiting
waiting
but
all
of
us
well
in
body
and
myself
finally
less
agitated
in
mind
my
old
friend
don
manuel
seems
better
also
he
may
yet
purge
and
live
clean
like
a
gentleman
i
found
upon
our
return
to
rosario
that
some
of
the
old
hands
were
missing
laid
low
by
the
scourge
to
make
room
for
others
and
some
were
spared
who
would
have
been
less
lamented
among
all
the
that
i
knew
at
rosario
and
i
knew
a
great
many
not
one
was
taken
away
they
all
escaped
being
it
was
thought
there
was
my
broker
don
christo
christiano
called
by
don
manuel
el
sweaga
the
swede
whom
nothing
could
strike
with
penetrative
force
except
a
commission
at
last
april
news
came
that
the
brazilian
ports
were
open
cholera
had
long
since
disappeared
in
santa
fè
and
buenos
aires
the
brazilians
had
established
their
own
factories
and
could
now
afford
to
open
their
ports
to
competition
this
made
a
great
stir
among
the
ships
crews
were
picked
up
here
and
there
out
of
the
few
brothels
that
had
not
been
pulled
down
during
the
cholera
and
out
of
the
streets
or
from
the
fields
some
too
came
in
from
the
bush
mixed
among
them
were
many
that
had
been
let
out
of
the
prisons
all
over
the
country
so
that
the
scourge
should
not
be
increased
by
jails
of
six
who
shipped
with
me
four
had
been
so
released
from
prison
where
they
had
been
serving
for
murder
or
highway
robbery
all
this
i
learned
when
it
was
too
late
i
shall
have
occasion
before
long
to
speak
of
these
again
well
we
unmoored
and
dropped
down
the
river
a
few
miles
the
first
day
with
this
crew
the
hardest
looking
set
that
ever
put
foot
on
a
ship
of
mine
and
with
a
swarthy
greek
pilot
that
would
be
taken
for
a
pirate
in
any
part
of
the
world
the
second
mate
who
shipped
also
at
rosario
was
not
less
and
had
in
addition
to
his
natural
ugly
features
a
deep
scar
across
his
face
suggestive
of
a
heavy
sabre
stroke
a
mark
which
i
thought
upon
further
acquaintance
he
had
probably
merited
i
could
not
make
myself
easy
upon
the
first
acquaintance
of
my
new
and
decidedly
crew
so
early
the
first
evening
i
brought
the
bark
to
anchor
and
made
all
snug
before
dark
for
prudent
reasons
next
morning
the
greek
instead
of
getting
the
bark
underweigh
as
i
expected
him
to
do
came
to
me
demanding
more
pay
for
his
services
and
thinking
maybe
that
i
could
not
do
without
him
demanded
unless
i
chose
to
pay
considerably
in
excess
of
his
regular
dues
to
be
put
on
shore
i
took
the
fellow
at
his
first
bounce
he
and
his
were
landed
on
the
bank
there
and
then
with
but
little
palaver
over
it
it
was
then
said
so
i
learned
after
that
old
s
would
drop
into
the
wake
of
some
ship
and
save
his
pilotage
in
fact
they
did
know
what
else
he
could
do
as
the
pilots
were
then
all
engaged
for
other
vessels
the
money
was
taken
care
of
all
right
and
so
was
the
by
daylight
of
the
following
morning
she
was
underweigh
and
under
full
sail
at
the
head
of
a
fleet
of
piloted
vessels
and
being
the
swiftest
sailer
easily
kept
the
lead
and
was
one
of
the
vessels
that
did
rompe
el
as
was
predicted
by
all
the
pilots
while
they
hunched
their
shoulders
above
their
ears
exclaiming
no
no
this
was
my
second
trip
down
the
parana
it
is
true
and
i
had
been
on
other
rivers
as
wonderful
as
this
one
and
had
moreover
read
mark
twain
life
on
the
mississippi
which
gives
no
end
of
information
on
river
currents
and
all
that
is
useful
to
know
about
rivers
so
that
i
was
confident
of
my
ability
all
that
had
been
required
was
the
that
i
got
from
the
impertinent
pilot
or
buccaneer
whichever
is
proper
to
call
him
one
thing
certain
he
was
no
true
sailor
a
strong
fair
wind
on
the
river
together
with
the
current
in
our
favour
carried
us
flying
down
the
channel
while
we
kept
the
lead
with
the
stars
and
stripes
waving
where
they
ought
always
to
be
seen
namely
on
the
ship
in
the
van
so
the
duffers
followed
us
instead
of
our
following
them
and
on
we
came
all
clear
with
the
good
wishes
of
the
officers
and
the
crews
but
the
pilots
drawing
their
shoulders
up
and
repeating
the
refrain
no
no
cursed
us
bitterly
and
were
in
a
vile
mood
i
was
told
cursing
more
than
usual
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
for
all
will
agree
who
have
heard
them
that
the
average
dago
pilot
is
the
most
thing
afloat
down
the
river
and
past
the
we
came
once
more
this
time
with
no
halt
to
make
no
backing
sails
to
let
a
pilot
off
nothing
at
all
to
stop
us
we
spread
all
sail
to
a
favourable
breeze
and
reached
ilha
grande
eight
days
afterward
beating
the
whole
fleet
by
two
days
garfield
kept
strict
account
of
this
he
was
on
deck
when
we
made
the
land
a
dark
and
foggy
night
it
was
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
dimmest
outline
of
a
headland
through
the
haze
i
knew
the
place
i
thought
and
garfield
said
he
could
smell
land
fog
or
this
it
will
be
admitted
was
reassuring
a
school
of
merry
porpoises
that
gambolled
under
the
bows
while
we
stood
confidently
in
for
the
land
diving
and
crossing
the
bark
course
in
every
direction
also
guarded
her
from
danger
i
knew
that
so
long
as
porpoises
kept
with
us
we
had
nothing
to
fear
of
the
ground
when
the
lookout
cried
porpoises
gone
we
turned
the
bark
head
backed
the
and
sent
out
the
pigeon
lead
a
few
grains
of
sand
and
one
soft
delicate
white
shell
were
brought
up
out
of
fourteen
fathoms
of
water
we
had
but
to
heed
these
warnings
and
guides
and
our
course
would
be
tolerably
clear
dense
and
all
as
the
fog
and
darkness
was
the
lead
was
kept
constantly
going
as
we
sailed
along
in
the
intense
darkness
till
the
headland
of
our
port
was
visible
through
the
haze
of
grey
morning
what
garfield
had
smelled
i
may
mention
turned
out
to
be
a
pot
of
which
had
been
capsized
on
deck
by
the
leadsman
in
the
night
by
daylight
in
the
morning
april
we
had
found
the
inner
entrance
to
ilha
grande
and
sailed
into
the
harbour
for
the
second
time
with
this
cargo
of
hay
it
was
still
very
foggy
and
all
day
heavy
gusts
of
wind
came
down
through
the
gulches
in
the
mountains
laden
with
fog
and
rain
two
days
later
the
weather
cleared
up
and
our
friends
began
to
come
in
they
found
us
there
all
right
anchored
close
under
the
highest
mountain
eight
days
of
sullen
gloom
and
rain
at
this
place
then
brimstone
smoke
and
fire
turned
on
to
us
and
we
were
counted
healthy
enough
to
be
admitted
to
in
rio
where
we
arrived
may
putting
one
more
day
between
ourselves
and
our
friendly
competitors
who
finally
arrived
safe
all
except
one
the
british
bark
she
was
destroyed
by
fire
between
the
two
ports
the
crew
was
rescued
by
captain
lunt
and
brought
safe
into
rio
next
day
at
the
fort
entrance
to
the
harbour
of
rio
we
were
again
challenged
and
brought
to
all
standing
on
the
bar
the
tide
running
like
a
mill
race
at
the
time
brought
the
bark
aback
on
her
cables
with
a
force
nearly
cutting
her
down
the
it
would
seem
had
outsailed
the
telegram
which
should
have
preceded
her
it
was
nevertheless
my
imperative
duty
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
port
authorities
which
however
should
have
been
tempered
with
reason
it
was
easy
for
them
in
the
fort
to
say
come
to
or
sink
you
but
we
in
the
bark
between
two
evils
came
near
being
sunk
by
obeying
the
order
formerly
when
a
vessel
was
challenged
at
this
fort
one
two
or
three
shots
if
necessary
to
bring
her
to
were
fired
at
a
cost
to
the
ship
if
she
were
not
american
of
fifteen
shillings
for
the
first
shot
thirty
for
the
second
and
sixty
for
the
third
but
for
american
ships
the
sixty
shilling
shot
was
fired
first
americans
would
always
have
the
best
after
all
the
difficulties
were
cleared
away
the
tardy
telegram
received
and
being
again
identified
by
the
officers
we
weighed
anchor
for
the
last
time
on
this
voyage
and
went
into
our
destined
port
the
spacious
and
charming
harbour
of
rio

sail
for

with
mixed
cargo
a

on

more
mixed
carried
away
arrive
safely
at
antonina
the
cargo
was
at
last
delivered
and
no
one
made
ill
over
it
a
change
of
rats
also
was
made
at
rio
those
we
brought
in
gave
place
to
others
from
the
dom
pedro
docks
where
we
moored
fleas
too
skipped
about
in
the
hay
as
happy
as
larks
and
nearly
as
big
and
all
the
other
live
stock
that
we
brought
from
rosario
goodness
knows
of
what
kind
and
kith
arrived
well
and
sound
from
over
the
water
notwithstanding
the
fumigations
and
fuss
made
at
the
quarantine
had
the
little
microbes
been
with
us
indeed
the
brazilians
would
not
have
turned
us
away
as
they
did
from
the
doors
of
an
hospital
for
they
are
neither
a
cruel
nor
cowardly
people
to
turn
sickness
away
would
be
cruel
and
stupid
to
say
the
least
what
we
were
expelled
for
i
have
already
explained
after
being
so
long
in
gloomy
circumstances
we
felt
like
making
the
most
of
pleasant
rio
therefore
on
the
first
fine
day
after
being
docked
we
sallied
out
in
quest
of
city
adventure
and
brought
up
first
in
ouvidor
the
broadway
of
rio
where
my
wife
bought
a
tall
hat
which
i
saw
nights
looming
up
like
a
dreadful
stack
of
hay
the
innocent
cause
of
much
trouble
to
me
and
i
declared
by
all
the
great
islands
in
my
dreams
that
go
back
with
it
i
would
not
but
would
pitch
it
first
into
the
sea
i
get
nervous
on
the
question
of
quarantines
i
visit
the
famous
botanical
gardens
with
my
family
and
i
tremble
with
fear
lest
we
are
fumigated
at
some
station
on
the
way
however
our
time
at
rio
is
pleasantly
spent
in
the
main
and
on
the
first
day
of
june
we
set
sail
once
more
for
paranagua
and
antonina
of
pleasant
recollections
partly
laden
with
flour
kerosene
pitch
tar
rosin
and
wine
three
pianos
i
remember
and
one
steam
engine
and
boiler
all
as
ballast
freight
free
so
the
bill
of
lading
read
and
further
that
the
ship
should
not
be
responsible
for
leakage
breakage
or
rust
this
clause
was
well
for
the
ship
as
one
of
those
wild
overtook
her
on
the
voyage
throwing
her
violently
on
her
and
shaking
the
motley
cargo
into
a
confused
and
mess
the
vessel
remaining
tight
however
no
very
serious
damage
was
done
and
she
righted
herself
after
a
while
but
without
her
lofty
which
went
with
a
crash
at
the
first
blast
of
the
tempest
this
incident
made
a
profound
impression
on
garfield
he
happened
to
be
on
deck
when
the
masts
were
carried
away
but
managed
to
scamper
off
without
getting
hurt
whenever
a
vessel
hove
in
sight
after
that
having
a
broken
spar
or
a
torn
sail
it
was
a
ship
the
storm
though
short
was
excessively
severe
and
swept
over
paranagua
and
antonina
with
unusual
violence
the
owner
of
the
pianos
i
was
told
prayed
for
us
and
regretted
that
his
goods
were
not
insured
but
when
they
were
landed
not
much
the
worse
for
their
tossing
about
old
strichine
the
owner
that
was
his
name
or
near
that
strychnine
the
boys
called
him
because
his
singing
was
worse
than
rough
on
rats
they
said
a
bit
of
juvenile
wit
that
the
artist
very
sensibly
let
pass
unheeded
declared
that
the
ship
was
a
good
one
and
that
her
captain
was
a
good
pilot
and
as
neither
freight
nor
insurance
had
been
paid
he
and
his
wife
would
feast
us
on
music
having
learned
that
i
especially
was
fond
of
it
they
had
screeched
operas
for
a
lifetime
in
italy
but
i
did
care
for
that
as
arranged
therefore
i
was
on
deck
at
the
appointed
time
and
place
to
stay
at
all
hazards
the
pianos
as
i
had
fully
expected
were
fearfully
out
of
tune
suffering
i
should
say
from
the
effects
of
seasickness
so
much
so
that
i
shall
always
believe
this
opportunity
was
seized
upon
by
the
artist
to
avenge
the
damage
to
his
instruments
which
indeed
i
could
not
avert
in
the
storm
that
we
passed
through
the
good
strichine
and
his
charming
wife
were
astonished
at
the
number
of
opera
airs
i
could
name
and
they
tried
to
persuade
me
to
sing
il
trovatore
but
concluding
that
damage
enough
had
already
been
done
i
refrained
that
is
i
refracted

down
before
a
rifle
order
restored
july
brings
me
to
a
sudden
and
shocking
point
in
the
history
of
the
voyage
that
i
fain
would
forget
but
that
will
not
be
possible
between
the
hours
of
and
of
this
day
i
was
called
instantly
to
defend
my
life
and
all
that
is
dear
to
a
man
the
bark
anchored
alone
in
the
harbour
of
antonina
was
hid
from
the
town
in
the
darkness
of
a
night
that
might
well
have
covered
the
blackest
of
tragedies
my
pirates
thought
their
opportunity
had
surely
come
to
capture
the
and
this
they
undertook
to
do
the
ringleader
of
the
gang
was
a
burly
scoundrel
whose
boast
was
that
he
had
licked
both
the
mate
and
second
mate
of
the
last
vessel
he
had
sailed
in
and
had
busted
the
captain
in
the
jaw
when
they
landed
in
rio
where
the
vessel
was
bound
and
where
of
course
the
captain
had
discharged
him
it
was
there
the
villain
shipped
with
me
in
lieu
of
one
of
the
rosario
gang
who
had
been
kindly
taken
in
charge
by
the
guard
at
ilha
grande
and
brought
to
rio
to
be
tried
before
the
american
consul
for
insubordination
said
he
one
day
when
i
urged
him
to
make
haste
and
help
save
the
topsails
in
a
squall
oh
i
no
to
be
hurried
it
was
the
time
the
bark
lost
her
and
was
cast
on
her
on
the
voyage
to
antonina
already
told
it
was
in
fact
no
time
for
loafing
and
this
braggart
at
a
decisive
word
hurried
aloft
with
the
rest
to
do
his
duty
what
i
said
to
him
was
meant
for
earnest
and
it
cowed
him
it
is
only
natural
to
think
that
he
held
a
grudge
against
me
forever
after
and
waited
only
for
his
opportunity
knowing
too
that
i
was
the
owner
of
the
bark
and
supposed
to
have
money
he
was
heard
to
say
in
a
a
day
or
two
before
the
attack
that
he
would
find
the
money
and
his
life
too
his
chum
and
bosom
friend
had
come
pretty
straight
from
palermo
penitentiary
at
buenos
aires
when
he
shipped
with
me
at
rosario
it
was
no
secret
on
board
the
bark
that
he
had
served
two
years
for
robbing
and
cutting
a
ranchman
throat
from
ear
to
ear
these
records
which
each
seemed
to
glory
in
were
verified
in
both
cases
i
met
the
captain
afterwards
who
had
been
busted
in
the
jaw
captain
roberts
of
baltimore
a
quiet
gentleman
with
no
evil
in
his
heart
for
any
one
and
a
man
like
myself
well
along
in
years
two
of
the
gang
old
rosario
hands
had
served
for
the
lesser
offence
of
robbery
alone
they
brought
up
in
the
rear
the
other
two
of
my
foremast
hands
one
a
very
respectable
hollander
the
other
a
little
japanese
sailor
a
bright
young
chap
had
been
robbed
and
beaten
by
the
four
ruffians
and
then
threatened
so
that
they
deserted
to
the
forest
instead
of
bringing
a
complaint
of
the
matter
to
me
for
fear
as
the
jap
expressed
it
afterwards
when
there
was
no
longer
any
danger
for
fear
the
mans
thieves
would
makee
killo
mi
the
ringleader
bully
had
made
unusual
efforts
to
create
a
row
when
i
came
on
board
early
in
the
evening
however
as
he
had
evidently
been
drinking
i
passed
it
off
as
best
i
could
for
the
natural
consequence
of
rum
and
ordered
him
forward
instead
of
doing
as
he
was
bid
when
i
turned
to
hand
my
wife
to
the
cabin
he
followed
me
threateningly
to
the
break
of
the
poop
what
struck
me
most
however
was
the
conduct
of
his
chum
who
was
sober
but
in
a
very
unusual
high
gleeful
mood
it
was
time
when
i
came
along
to
where
he
was
seizing
off
the
mizzen
topgallant
backstay
the
last
of
the
work
of
refitting
the
late
damage
and
the
mate
being
elsewhere
engaged
i
gave
the
usual
order
to
quit
work
knock
off
i
said
to
the
man
and
put
away
your
tools
the
bark
rigging
looks
well
i
added
and
if
turns
out
fine
all
will
be
finished
whereupon
the
fellow
laughed
impertinently
in
my
face
repeating
my
words
all
will
be
finished
under
his
breath
adding
before
this
was
the
first
insult
offered
by
the
bloodthirsty
tommy
who
had
committed
murder
only
a
short
time
before
but
i
had
been
watched
by
the
fellow
with
a
eye
at
every
turn
the
full
significance
of
his
words
on
this
occasion
came
up
to
me
only
next
morning
when
i
saw
him
lying
on
the
deck
with
a
murderous
weapon
in
his
hand
i
was
not
expecting
a
cowardly
night
attack
nevertheless
i
kept
my
gun
loaded
i
went
to
sleep
this
night
as
usual
forgetting
the
unpleasant
episode
as
soon
as
my
head
touched
the
pillow
but
my
wife
with
finer
instincts
kept
awake
it
was
well
for
us
all
that
she
did
so
near
midnight
my
wife
who
had
heard
the
first
footstep
on
the
quietly
wakened
me
saying
we
must
get
up
and
look
out
for
ourselves
something
is
going
wrong
on
deck
the
boat
tackle
has
been
let
go
with
a
great
deal
of
noise
and
o
do
go
that
way
on
deck
i
heard
some
one
on
the
cabin
steps
and
heard
whispering
in
the
forward
entry
you
must
have
been
dreaming
i
said
no
indeed
said
she
i
have
not
been
asleep
yet
do
go
on
deck
by
the
forward
companionway
they
are
waiting
there
i
am
sure
for
i
heard
the
creaking
of
the
loose
step
in
the
entry
if
my
wife
has
not
been
dreaming
thought
i
there
can
be
no
possible
doubt
of
a
plot
nothing
justifies
a
visit
on
the
after
except
a
call
to
relieve
sickness
or
for
some
other
emergency
and
then
secrecy
or
stealth
is
it
may
be
here
explained
to
persons
not
familiar
with
ships
that
the
sailors
quarters
are
in
the
forward
part
of
the
ship
where
they
the
sailors
are
supposed
to
be
found
after
in
port
coming
never
abaft
the
mainmast
hence
the
term
before
the
mast
my
first
impulse
was
to
step
on
deck
in
the
usual
way
but
the
earnest
entreaties
of
my
wife
awoke
me
to
a
danger
that
should
be
investigated
with
caution
arming
myself
therefore
with
a
stout
carbine
repeater
with
eight
ball
cartridges
in
the
magazine
i
stepped
on
deck
abaft
instead
of
forward
where
evidently
i
had
been
expected
i
stood
rubbing
my
eyes
for
a
moment
inuring
them
to
the
intense
darkness
when
a
coarse
voice
roared
down
the
forward
companionway
to
me
to
come
on
deck
why
do
ye
come
on
deck
like
a
man
and
order
yer
men
forid
was
the
salute
that
i
got
and
was
the
first
that
i
heard
with
my
own
ears
and
it
was
enough
to
tell
the
whole
story
in
a
word
i
knew
that
i
had
to
face
a
mutiny
i
could
do
no
less
than
say
go
forward
there
yer
there
are
ye
said
the
spokesman
as
with
an
oath
he
bounded
toward
me
cursing
as
he
came
again
i
ordered
him
forward
saying
i
am
armed
if
you
come
here
i
will
shoot
but
i
forbore
to
do
so
instantly
thinking
to
club
him
to
the
deck
instead
for
my
carbine
was
a
heavy
one
i
dealt
him
a
blow
as
he
came
near
sufficient
i
thought
to
fell
an
ox
but
it
had
apparently
no
effect
and
instantly
he
was
inside
of
my
guard
then
grasping
me
by
the
throat
he
tried
to
force
me
over
the
taffrail
and
cried
exultingly
as
he
felt
me
give
way
under
his
brute
strength
now
you
damn
fool
shoot
at
the
same
time
drawing
his
knife
to
strike
i
could
not
speak
or
even
breathe
but
my
carbine
spoke
for
me
and
the
ruffian
fell
with
the
knife
in
his
hand
which
had
been
raised
against
me
resolution
had
proved
more
than
a
match
for
brute
force
for
i
then
knew
that
not
only
my
own
life
but
also
the
lives
of
others
depended
on
me
at
this
moment
nothing
daunted
the
rest
came
on
like
hungry
wolves
again
i
cried
go
forward
but
thinking
maybe
that
my
rifle
was
a
single
shooter
or
that
i
could
not
load
it
so
quickly
the
order
was
disregarded
what
if
i
do
go
forward
was
bloody
tommy
threatening
question
adding
as
he
sprang
toward
me
i
got
this
for
you
but
fell
instantly
as
he
raised
his
hand
and
there
on
the
deck
was
ended
his
misadventure
and
like
the
other
he
fell
with
the
deadly
knife
in
his
hand
i
was
now
all
right
the
dread
of
cold
steel
had
left
me
when
i
freed
myself
from
the
first
assassin
and
i
only
wondered
how
many
more
would
persist
in
trying
to
take
my
life
but
recollecting
there
were
only
two
mutineers
left
and
that
i
had
still
six
shots
in
the
magazine
of
my
rifle
and
one
already
in
the
chamber
i
stood
ready
with
the
hammer
raised
and
my
finger
on
the
trigger
confident
that
i
would
not
be
put
down
there
was
no
further
need
of
extreme
measures
however
for
order
was
now
restored
though
two
of
the
assailants
had
skulked
away
in
the
dark
how
it
was
that
i
regained
my
advantage
after
once
losing
it
i
hardly
know
but
this
i
am
certain
of
that
being
down
i
was
not
to
be
spared
then
desperation
took
the
place
of
fear
and
i
felt
more
than
a
match
for
all
that
could
come
against
me
i
had
no
other
than
serene
feelings
however
and
had
no
wish
to
pursue
the
two
pirates
that
fled
immediately
after
the
second
shot
was
fired
and
i
found
myself
once
more
master
of
my
bark
the
remaining
two
came
aft
again
at
my
bidding
this
time
and
in
an
orderly
manner
it
may
be
believed
it
is
idle
to
say
what
i
would
or
would
not
have
given
to
have
the
calamity
averted
or
in
other
words
to
have
had
a
crew
of
sailors
instead
of
a
gang
of
however
when
the
climax
came
i
had
but
one
course
to
pursue
this
i
resolutely
followed
a
man
will
defend
himself
and
his
family
to
the
last
for
life
is
sweet
after
all
it
was
significant
the
court
thought
afterwards
that
while
my
son
had
not
had
time
to
dress
they
all
had
on
their
boots
except
the
one
who
fell
last
and
he
was
in
his
socks
with
no
boots
on
it
was
he
who
had
waited
for
me
as
i
have
already
said
on
the
cabin
steps
that
i
usually
passed
up
and
down
on
but
this
time
avoided
circumstantial
evidence
came
up
in
abundance
to
make
the
case
perfectly
clear
to
the
authorities
there
are
few
who
will
care
to
hear
more
about
a
subject
so
abhorrent
to
all
and
i
care
less
to
write
about
it
i
would
not
have
said
this
much
but
for
the
enterprise
of
a
rising
department
clerk
who
seeing
the
importance
of
telling
to
the
world
what
he
knew
and
seeing
also
some
small
emolument
in
the
matter
was
i
believe
prompted
to
augment
the
consular
dispatches
thus
obliging
me
to
fight
the
battle
over
however
not
to
be
severe
on
the
poor
clerk
i
will
only
add
that
no
indignities
were
offered
me
by
the
authorities
through
all
the
strict
investigation
that
followed
the
tragedy
the
trial
being
for
justice
and
not
for
my
money
the
case
was
soon
finished
i
sincerely
hope
that
i
may
never
again
encounter
such
as
those
who
came
from
the
jails
to
bring
harm
and
sorrow
in
their
wake
the
work
of
loading
was
finished
soon
after
the
calamity
to
my
bark
and
a
spanish
was
engaged
to
take
her
to
montevideo
my
son
victor
going
as
flag
captain
i
piloted
the
out
of
the
harbour
and
left
her
clear
of
the
buoy
looking
as
neat
and
trim
as
sailor
could
wish
to
see
all
the
damage
done
by
the

all
made
ataunto
i
saw
my
handsome
bark
well
clear
of
the
dangers
of
the
harbour
limits
then
in
sorrow
i
left
her
and
paddled
back
to
the
town
for
i
was
on
parole
to
appear
as
i
have
said
for
trial
that
was
the
word
i
can
find
no
other
name
for
it

him
have
full
charge
in
nearly
everything
i
could
have
trusted
the
lad
with
full
command
young
as
he
was
but
there
was
a
strange
crew
of
foreigners
which
might
as
often
happens
require
maturer
judgment
to
manage
than
to
sail
the
vessel
as
it
proved
however
even
the
was
in
many
ways
a
better
man
than
the
victor
met
me
with
a
long
face
and
the
sailors
wore
a
quizzical
look
as
i
came
over
the
vessel
side
one
of
them
in
particular
whom
i
shall
always
remember
gave
me
a
greeting
along
with
his
shake
of
the
head
that
told
volumes
and
next
day
was
aloft
crossing
yards
cheerfully
enough
i
found
my
brazilian
crew
to
be
excellent
sailors
and
things
on
board
the
immediately
began
to
assume
a
brighter
appearance
aloft
and
alow
cargo
was
soon
discharged
other
cargo
taken
in
and
the
bark
made
ready
for
sea
my
crew
i
say
was
a
good
one
but
poor
fellows
they
were
doomed
to
trials
the
worst
within
human
experience
many
of
them
giving
up
to
grim
death
before
the
voyage
was
ended
too
often
one
bit
of
bad
luck
follows
another
this
rule
brought
us
in
contact
with
one
of
these
small
officials
at
montevideo
better
adapted
to
home
life
one
of
those
knowing
perhaps
more
than
need
a
cowboy
but
not
enough
for
consul
this
official
managing
to
get
word
to
my
crew
that
a
change
of
master
dissolved
their
contract
induced
them
to
come
on
shore
and
claim
pay
for
the
whole
voyage
and
passage
home
on
a
steamer
besides
the
same
as
though
the
bark
had
been
sold
what
overwhelming
troubles
may
come
of
having
incompetent
officials
in
places
of
trust
the
sequel
will
show
this
unwise
even
stupid
interference
was
the
indirect
cause
of
the
sufferings
and
deaths
among
the
crew
which
followed
i
was
able
to
show
the
consul
and
his
clerk
that
sailors
are
always
engaged
for
the
ship
and
never
for
the
master
and
that
a
change
of
master
did
not
in
any
way
affect
their
contract
however
i
paid
the
crew
off
and
then
left
it
to
their
option
to
or
not
for
they
were
all
right
they
had
been
led
to
do
what
they
did
and
i
knew
that
they
wanted
to
get
home
and
it
was
there
that
the
bark
was
going
direct
all
signed
the
articles
again
except
one
a
andalusian
whom
i
would
not
have
longer
at
any
price
the
wages
remained
the
same
as
before
and
all
hands
returned
to
their
duty
cheerful
and
contented
but
pending
the
consul
decision
which
by
the
way
i
decided
for
him
they
had
slept
in
a
contagioned
house
where
alas
they
contracted
of
the
worst
type
we
were
now
homeward
bound
all
the
runaway
rum
that
could
be
held
out
by
the
most
subtle
crimps
of
montevideo
could
not
induce
these
sober
brazilian
sailors
to
desert
their
ship
these
crimps
are
who
get
the
sailors
drunk
when
they
can
and
then
rob
them
of
their
advance
money
the
sailors
are
all
paid
in
advance
sometimes
they
receive
in
this
way
most
of
their
wages
for
the
voyage
which
they
make
after
the
money
is
spent
or
wasted
or
stolen
we
all
know
what
working
for
dead
horse
means
sailors
know
too
well
its
significance
as
sailing
day
drew
near
a
liberty
to
each
watch
was
asked
for
by
the
men
who
wanted
to
make
purchases
for
their
friends
and
relatives
at
paranagua
permission
to
go
on
shore
was
readily
granted
and
i
was
rewarded
by
seeing
every
one
return
to
his
ship
at
the
time
promised
and
every
one
sober
on
the
morrow
which
was
sailing
day
every
man
was
at
his
post
and
all
sang
cheerily
ho
and
were
happy
all
except
one
who
complained
of
slight
chills
and
a
fever
but
said
that
he
had
been
subject
to
this
and
that
with
a
dose
of
quinine
he
would
soon
be
all
right
again
it
appeared
a
small
matter
two
days
later
though
his
chills
turned
to
something
which
i
knew
less
about
the
next
day
three
more
men
went
down
with
rigor
in
the
spine
and
at
the
base
of
the
brain
i
knew
by
this
that
was
among
us
we
bore
up
at
once
for
maldonado
which
was
the
nearest
port
the
place
spoken
of
in
gulliver
travels
though
gulliver
i
think
is
mistaken
as
to
its
identity
and
location
arriving
there
before
a
gathering
storm
that
blew
wet
and
cold
from
the
east
our
signals
of
distress
asking
for
immediate
medical
aid
were
set
and
flew
hours
before
any
one
came
to
us
then
a
scared
yahoo
the
country
was
still
inhabited
by
yahoos
in
a
boat
rowed
by
two
other
animals
came
aboard
and
said
yes
your
men
have
got
he
called
it
but
i
understand
the
lingo
of
the
yahoo
very
well
i
could
even
speak
a
few
words
of
it
and
comprehend
the
meanings
he
bellowed
to
his
mates
alongside
and
turning
to
me
he
said
in
yahoo
you
must
leave
the
port
at
once
then
jumping
into
his
boat
he
hurried
away
along
with
his
scared
companions
to
leave
a
port
in
our
condition
was
hard
lines
but
my
perishing
crew
could
get
no
succour
at
maldonado
so
we
could
do
nothing
but
leave
if
at
all
able
to
do
so
we
were
indeed
but
desperation
lending
a
hand
the
anchor
was
weighed
and
sufficient
sail
set
on
the
bark
to
clear
the
inhospitable
port
the
wind
blowing
fair
out
of
the
harbour
carried
us
away
from
the
port
toward
flores
island
for
which
we
now
headed
in
sore
distress
a
gale
long
to
be
remembered
sprang
suddenly
up
stripping
off
our
sails
like
autumn
leaves
before
the
bark
was
three
leagues
from
the
place
we
had
strength
to
clew
up
so
her
sails
were
blown
away
and
she
went
flying
before
the
mad
tempest
under
bare
poles
a
came
for
shelter
from
the
storm
and
poised
on
the
deck
to
rest
the
incident
filled
my
sailors
with
awe
to
them
it
was
a
portentous
omen
and
in
distress
they
dragged
themselves
together
and
prostrate
before
the
bird
prayed
the
holy
virgin
to
ask
god
to
keep
them
from
harm
the
rain
beat
on
us
in
torrents
as
the
bark
tossed
and
reeled
ahead
and
day
turned
black
as
night
the
gale
was
from
and
our
course
lay
nearly
or
nearly
before
it
i
stood
at
the
wheel
with
my
shore
clothes
on
i
remember
for
i
yet
had
time
to
change
them
for
waterproofs
this
of
itself
was
small
matter
but
it
reminds
me
now
that
i
was
busy
with
other
concerns
i
was
always
a
good
helmsman
and
i
took
in
hand
now
the
steering
of
the
bark
in
the
storm
and
i
gave
directions
to
victor
and
the
carpenter
how
to
mix
disinfectants
for
themselves
and
medicines
for
the
sick
men
the
medicine
chest
was
fairly
supplied
flores
when
seen
was
but
a
few
ship
lengths
away
flashes
of
lightning
revealed
the
low
cliffs
amazingly
near
to
us
and
as
the
bark
swept
by
with
great
speed
the
roar
of
the
breakers
on
the
shore
heard
above
the
din
of
the
storm
told
us
of
a
danger
to
beware
the
helm
was
then
put
down
and
she
came
to
under
the
lee
of
the
island
like
a
true
obedient
thing
both
anchors
were
let
go
and
all
the
chain
paid
out
to
both
to
the
bitter
end
for
the
gale
was
now
a
hurricane
she
walked
away
with
her
anchors
for
all
that
we
could
do
till
hooking
a
marine
cable
one
was
carried
away
and
the
other
brought
her
head
to
the
wind
and
held
her
there
trembling
in
the
storm
anxious
fear
lest
the
second
cable
should
break
was
on
our
minds
through
the
night
but
a
greater
danger
was
within
the
ship
that
filled
us
all
with
alarm
two
barks
not
far
from
us
that
night
with
pilots
on
board
were
lost
in
trying
to
come
through
where
the
without
a
pilot
and
with
but
three
hands
on
deck
to
work
her
came
in
their
crews
with
great
difficulty
were
rescued
and
then
carried
to
montevideo
when
all
had
been
done
that
we
three
could
do
a
light
was
put
in
the
rigging
that
flickered
in
the
gale
and
went
out
then
wet
and
lame
and
weary
we
fell
down
in
our
drenched
clothes
to
rest
as
we
might
to
sleep
or
to
listen
to
groans
of
our
dying
shipmates
when
daylight
came
after
this
the
most
dismal
of
all
my
nights
at
sea
our
signals
went
up
telling
of
the
sad
condition
of
the
crew
and
begging
for
medical
assistance
toward
night
the
gale
went
down
but
as
no
boat
came
off
a
gloom
darker
than
midnight
settled
over
the
crew
of
the
bark
and
in
dismay
they
again
prayed
to
be
spared
to
meet
the
loved
ones
awaiting
them
at
home
our
repeated
signals
next
day
brought
the
reply
stand
in
why
we
could
hardly
stand
at
all
much
less
could
we
get
the
bark
underway
and
beat
in
against
wind
and
current
no
one
knew
this
better
than
they
on
the
island
for
my
signals
had
told
the
whole
story
and
as
we
were
only
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
shore
the
flags
were
distinctly
made
out
there
was
no
doubt
in
our
minds
about
that
late
in
the
day
however
a
barge
came
out
to
us
and
by
as
scared
a
set
of
galoots
as
ever
capsized
a
boat
or
trembled
at
a
shadow
the
coxswain
had
more
to
say
than
the
doctor
and
the
yahoo
i
forgot
to
mention
that
we
were
still
in
yahoodom
but
one
would
see
that
without
this
explanation
the
yahoo
in
the
bow
said
more
than
both
and
they
all
took
a
stiff
pull
from
a
bottle
of
the
doctor
having
had
the
start
i
should
say
of
at
least
one
or
two
pulls
before
leaving
the
shore
insomuch
as
he
appeared
braver
than
the
rest
of
the
crew
the
doctor
having
taken
an
extra
horn
or
two
with
dutch
courage
came
on
board
and
brought
with
him
a
pound
of
sulphur
a
pint
of
carbolic
acid
and
some
barley
enough
to
feed
a
robin
a
few
times
for
all
of
which
we
were
thankful
indeed
our
disinfectants
being
by
this
time
nearly
exhausted
then
glancing
at
the
prostrate
men
he
hurried
away
as
the
other
had
done
at
maldonado
i
asked
what
i
should
do
with
the
dead
through
the
night
bury
them
where
we
lay
oh
no
no
cried
the
yahoo
in
the
bow
but
the
doctor
pointed
significantly
to
the
water
alongside
i
knew
what
he
meant
that
night
we
buried
josé
the
sailor
whose
honest
smile
had
welcomed
me
to
my
bark
at
montevideo
i
had
ordered
stones
brought
on
deck
before
dark
ostensibly
to
ballast
the
boat
i
knew
they
would
soon
be
wanted
about
midnight
the
cook
called
me
in
sore
distress
saying
that
josé
was
dying
without
confession
so
poor
josé
was
buried
that
night
in
the
great
river
plate
i
listened
to
the
solemn
splash
that
told
of
one
life
ended
and
its
work
done
but
gloomy
and
sad
and
melancholy
as
the
case
was
i
had
to
smile
when
the
cook
not
having
the
ballast
threw
it
over
after
his
friend
exclaiming
josé
i
added
good
shipmate
i
doubt
not
that
you
rest
well
next
day
the
signal
from
the
shore
was
the
same
as
the
day
before
stand
in
in
answer
to
my
repeated
call
for
help
by
this
time
my
men
were
demoralized
and
and
the
poor
fellows
begged
me
if
the
doctor
would
not
try
to
cure
them
to
get
a
priest
to
confess
them
all
i
saw
a
padre
pacing
the
beach
and
set
flags
asking
him
to
come
on
board
no
notice
was
taken
of
the
signal
and
we
were
now
left
entirely
to
ourselves
after
burying
one
more
of
the
crew
we
decided
to
remain
no
longer
at
this
terrible
place
an
english
telegraph
tender
passing
caught
up
our
signals
at
that
point
and
kindly
reported
to
her
consul
at
maldonado
who
wired
it
to
montevideo
the
wind
blowing
away
from
the
shore
as
may
it
always
blow
when
friend
of
mine
nears
that
coast
we
determined
to
weigh
anchor
or
slip
cable
without
further
loss
of
time
feeling
assured
that
by
the
telegraph
reports
some
one
would
be
on
the
for
us
and
that
the
would
be
towed
into
port
if
the
worst
should
happen
if
the
rest
of
her
crew
went
down
three
of
us
weighed
one
anchor
with
its
ninety
fathoms
of
chain
the
other
had
parted
on
the
windlass
in
the
gale
the
bark
prow
was
now
turned
toward
montevideo
the
place
we
had
so
recently
sailed
from
full
of
hope
and
pleasant
anticipation
and
here
we
were
dejected
and
filled
with
misery
some
of
our
number
already
gone
on
that
voyage
which
somehow
seems
so
far
away
at
montevideo
things
were
better
they
take
my
remaining
sick
men
out
of
the
vessel
after
two
days
delay
my
agent
procuring
a
tug
which
towed
them
in
the
ship
boat
three
hundred
fathoms
astern
in
this
way
they
were
taken
to
flores
island
where
days
and
days
before
they
had
been
refused
admittance
they
were
accompanied
this
time
by
an
order
from
the
governor
of
montevideo
and
at
last
were
taken
in
two
of
the
cases
were
by
this
time
in
the
favourable
change
but
the
poor
old
cook
who
stood
faithfully
by
me
and
would
not
desert
his
old
shipmates
going
with
them
to
the
island
to
care
for
them
to
the
last
took
the
dread
disease
died
of
it
and
was
there
buried
not
far
from
where
he
himself
had
buried
his
friend
josé
a
short
time
before
the
death
of
this
faithful
man
occurred
on
the
day
that
the
bark
finally
sailed
seaward
by
the
island
she
was
in
sight
from
the
hospital
window
when
his
phantom
ship
that
put
out
carried
him
over
the
bar
his
widow
at
paranagua
i
was
told
on
learning
the
fate
of
her
husband
died
of
grief
the
work
of
disinfecting
the
vessel
at
montevideo
after
the
sick
were
removed
was
a
source
of
speculation
that
was
most
elaborately
carried
on
demijohns
of
carbolic
acid
were
put
on
board
by
the
dozen
at
per
demijohn
all
diluted
ready
for
use
and
a
was
put
on
board
to
use
it
up
which
he
did
religiously
over
his
own
precious
self
in
my
as
far
from
the
end
of
the
ship
where
the
danger
was
as
he
could
get
some
one
else
disinfected
not
he
abundant
as
the
stuff
was
i
had
to
look
sharp
for
enough
to
wash
out
forward
while
aft
it
was
almost
at
three
dollars
a
jar
the
harpy
that
alighted
on
deck
at
maldonado
sent
in
his
bill
for
one
hundred
dollars
i
paid
eighty
the
cost
to
me
of
all
this
trouble
in
money
paid
out
irrelevantly
to
mention
was
over
a
thousand
dollars
what
it
cost
me
in
health
and
mental
anxiety
can
not
be
estimated
by
such
value
still
i
was
not
the
greatest
sufferer
my
hardest
task
was
to
come
you
will
believe
at
the
gathering
up
of
the
trinkets
and
other
purchases
which
the
crew
had
made
thoughtful
of
wife
and
child
at
home
all
had
to
be
burned
or
spoiled
with
carbolic
acid
a
hat
for
the
little
boy
here
a
pair
of
boots
for
his
mamma
there
and
many
things
for
the
all
around
all
had
to
be
destroyed
footnotes
in
our
discourse
yahoo
was
spoken
but
i
write
it
in
english
because
many
of
my
readers
would
not
understand
the
original
the
signals
that
we
used
were
made
by
universal
code
symbols
for
example
two
flags
hoisted
representing
p
d
signified
want
or
wants
immediate
medical
assistance
and
so
on
by
hoists
of
two
three
or
four
flags
representing
the
consonants
our

a
new
crew
sail
for
antonina
load
timber
native
canoes
loss
of
the
after
all
this
sad
trouble
was
over
a
new
crew
was
shipped
and
the
prow
again
turned
seaward
passing
out
by
flores
soon
after
we
observed
the
searching
i
learned
for
a
supposed
sunken
bark
which
had
appeared
between
squalls
in
the
late
gale
with
signals
of
distress
set
i
was
satisfied
from
the
account
that
it
was
our
bark
which
they
had
seen
in
the
gale
and
the
supposed
flags
were
our
tattered
sails
what
there
was
left
of
them
streaming
in
the
storm
but
we
did
not
discourage
the
search
as
it
could
do
no
harm
and
i
thought
that
they
might
perhaps
find
something
else
worth
knowing
about
this
was
the
day
as
i
have
said
on
which
my
faithful
cook
died
while
the
bark
was
in
sight
from
the
window
of
his
sick
ward
it
was
a
bright
fine
day
to
us
we
can
not
say
that
it
was
otherwise
than
bright
to
him
breathing
once
more
the
fresh
air
of
the
sea
we
set
all
sail
for
paranagua
passing
the
lights
on
the
coast
to
leave
them
flickering
on
the
horizon
then
soon
out
of
sight
fine
weather
prevailed
but
with
much
head
wind
still
we
progressed
and
rarely
a
day
passed
but
something
of
the
distance
toward
our
port
was
gained
one
day
however
coming
to
an
island
one
that
was
inhabited
only
by
birds
we
came
to
a
stand
as
if
it
were
impossible
to
go
farther
on
the
voyage
a
spell
seemed
to
hang
over
us
i
recognized
the
place
as
one
that
i
knew
well
a
very
dear
friend
had
stood
by
me
on
deck
looking
at
this
island
some
years
before
it
was
the
last
land
that
my
friend
ever
saw
i
would
fain
have
sailed
around
it
now
but
a
puff
of
fair
wind
coming
sent
us
on
our
course
for
the
time
some
leagues
beyond
at
sunset
though
this
wind
went
down
and
with
the
current
we
drifted
back
so
much
that
by
the
next
day
we
were
farther
off
on
the
other
side
however
fair
wind
coming
again
we
passed
up
inside
making
thus
the
circuit
of
the
island
at
last
more
or
less
favourable
winds
thenceforth
filled
our
sails
till
at
last
our
destined
port
was
gained
the
little
town
of
antonina
where
my
wife
and
garfield
had
remained
over
during
this
voyage
twelve
miles
up
the
bay
from
paranagua
soon
after
our
arrival
was
made
alive
with
the
noise
of
children
marching
to
children
own
music
my
yawcob
heading
the
band
with
a
organ
the
most
envied
fellow
of
the
whole
crowd
sorrows
of
the
past
took
flight
or
were
locked
in
the
closet
at
home
the
fittest
place
for
past
misfortunes
a
truly
hard
voyage
for
us
all
was
that
to
montevideo
the
survivors
reached
home
after
a
while
their
features
were
terribly
marked
and
disfigured
so
much
so
that
i
did
not
know
them
till
they
accosted
me
when
we
met
i
look
back
with
pleasure
to
the
good
character
of
my
brazilian
sailors
regretting
the
more
their
hard
luck
and
sad
fate
we
may
meet
again
sabe
getting
over
all
this
sad
business
as
best
we
could
we
entered
on
the
next
venture
which
was
to
purchase
and
load
a
cargo
of
the
famous
brazilian
wood
the
was
shifted
to
an
arm
of
the
bay
where
she
was
moored
under
the
lee
of
a
virgin
forest
twenty
minutes
canoe
ride
from
the
village
of
guarakasava
where
she
soon
began
to
load
the
timber
of
this
country
generally
very
heavy
is
nevertheless
hauled
by
hand
to
the
water
where
lashed
to
canoes
it
is
floated
to
the
ship
these
canoes
formed
sometimes
from
mammoth
trees
skilfully
shaped
and
dug
out
with
care
are

the
carriage
and
of
the
family
to
the
or
the
rice
to

roads
are
hardly
known
where
the
canoe
is
available
men
women
and
children
are
consequently
alike
skilled
in
the
art
of
canoeing
to
perfection
almost
there
are
no
carriages
to
speak
of
in
such
places
even
a
saddle
horse
about
the
waterfront
is
a
there
was
indeed
one
horse
at
guarakasava
the
owner
of
it
was
very
conspicuous
the
family
canoe
just
spoken
of
has
the
capacity
often
of
several
tons
is
handsomely
decorated
with
carvings
along
the
topsides
and
is
painted
as
the
geordie
would
say
in
none
o
your
gaudy
colours
but
in
good
plain
red
or
blue
sometimes
however
they
are
painted
green
the
cost
of
these
handsome
canoes
are
say
from
down
in
price
and
size
from
the
grand
turnout
to
the
craft
which
may
be
purchased
for
five
milreis
from
the
greatest
to
the
smallest
they
are
cared
for
with
almost
an
affectionate
care
and
are
made
to
last
many
years
one
thing
else
which
even
the
poorest
brazilian
thinks
much
of
is
his
affectionate
wife
who
literally
and
figuratively
is
often
in
the
same
boat
with
her
husband
pulling
against
the
stream
family
ties
are
strong
in
brazil
and
the
sweet
flower
of
friendship
thrives
in
its
sunny
clime
the
system
of
land
and
sea
breezes
prevail
on
the
coast
from
cape
frio
to
saint
catherine
with
great
regularity
most
of
the
year
the
sail
is
therefore
used
to
good
advantage
by
the
almost
amphibious
inhabitants
along
the
coast
who
love
the
water
and
take
to
it
like
ducks
and
natural
born
sailors
the
wind
falling

they
propel
their
canoes
by
paddle
or
long
pole
with
equal
facility
the
occupants
standing
in
the
smaller
ones
force
them
along
at
a
great
speed
the
larger

the
wind
does
not
serve
are
pulled
by
banks
of
oars
which
are
fastened
to
stout
pegs
in
the
gunwail
with
grummits
that
fit
loosely
over
the
oars
so
as
to
allow
them
free
play
in
the

of
the
waterman
curling
the
water
with
fine
shapely
prows
as
they
dart
over
the
smooth
waters
of
the
bays
and
rivers
these
canoes
present
a
picture
of
unrivalled
skill
and
grace
i
find
the
following
entry
in
my
diary
made
near
the
close
of
transactions
at
guarakasava
which
in
the
truthful
word
of
an
historian
i
am
bound
to
record
if
only
to
show
my
prevailing
high
opinion
of
the
natives
while
i
was
among
them
guarakasava
heretofore
i
have
doted
on
native
brazilian
honesty
as
well
as
national
seamanship
and
skill
in
canoes
but
my
dream
of
a
perfect
paradise
is
now
unsettled
forever
i
find
alas
that
even
here
the
fall
of
adam
is
felt
taking
in
some
long
poles
the
negro
tallyman
persisted
in
counting
twice
the
same
pole
when
the
first
end
entered
the
port
it
was
one
when
the
last
end
disappeared
into
the
ship
he
would
sing
out
two
i
had
no
serious
difficulty
over
the
matter
but
left
guarakasava
with
that
hurt
feeling
which
comes
of
being
over
persuaded
that
one
and
one
make
four
we
spent
christmas
of
at
guarakasava
the
bark
was
loaded
soon
after
and
when
proceeding
across
the
bay
where
currents
and
wind
caught
her
foul
near
a
dangerous
sand
bar
she
misstayed
and
went
on
the
strand
the
anchor
was
let
go
to
club
her
it
would
hold
in
the
treacherous
sands
so
she
dragged
and
stranded
broadside
on
where
open
to
the
sea
a
strong
swell
came
in
that
raked
her
fore
and
aft
for
three
days
the
waves
dashing
over
her
groaning
hull
the
while
till
at
last
her
back
was
broke
and
why
not
add
heart
as
well
for
she
lay
now
undone
after
years
of
good
service
the
here
ended
her
days
i
had
myself
carried
load
on
load
but
alas
i
could
not
carry
a
mountain
and
was
now
at
the
end
where
my
best
skill
and
energy
could
not
avail
what
was
to
be
done
what
could
be
done
we
had
indeed
the
appearance
of
shipwrecked
people
away
too
from
home
this
was
no
time
to
weep
for
the
lives
of
all
the
crew
were
saved
neither
was
it
a
time
to
laugh
for
our
loss
was
great
but
the
sea
calmed
down
and
i
sold
the
wreck
which
floated
off
at
the
end
of
the
storm
and
after
paying
the
crew
their
wages
out
of
the
proceeds
had
a
moiety
left
for
myself
and
family
a
small
sum
then
i
began
to
look
about
for
the
future
and
for
means
of
escape
from
exile
the
crew
foreign
found
shipping
for
montevideo
where
they
had
joined
the
in
lieu
of
the
stricken
brazilian
sailors
but
for
myself
and
family
this
outlet
was
hardly
available
even
if
we
had
cared
to
go
farther
from
home
which
was
the
least
of
our
thoughts
and
there
were
no
vessels
coming
our
way

to
cheer
the
brave
when
all
had
been
saved
from
the
wreck
that
was
worth
saving
or
that
could
be
saved
we
found
ourselves
still
in
the
possession
of
some
goods
soon
to
become
of
great
value
to
us
especially
my
compass
and
charts
which
though
much
damaged
were
yet
serviceable
and
suggested
practical
usefulness
and
the
chronometer
being
found
intact
my
course
was
no
longer
undecided
my
wife
and
sons
agreeing
with
what
i
thought
best
the
plan
in
a
word
was
this
we
could
not
beg
our
way
neither
would
we
sit
idle
among
the
natives
we
found
that
it
would
require
more
courage
to
remain
in
the
country
than
to
return
home
in
a
boat
which
then
we
concluded
to
build
and
for
that
purpose
my
son
victor
with
much
pride
and
sympathy
entered
heartily
into
the
plan
which
promised
a
speedy
return
home
he
bent
his
energies
in
a
practical
direction
working
on
the
boat
like
an
old
builder
before
entering
on
the
project
however
all
responsibilities
were
considered
swift
ocean
currents
around
capes
and
coral
reefs
were
taken
into
account
and
above
all
else
to
be
called
dangerous
we
knew
would
be
the
fierce
tropical
storms
which
surely
we
would
encounter

of
the

weight

but
a
boat
should
be
built
stout
and
strong
we
all
said
one
in
which
we
should
not
be
afraid
to
trust
our
lives
even
in
the
storm
and
with
the
advantage
of
experience
in
ships
and
boats
of
various
sizes
and
in
many
seas
i
turned
to
the
work
of
constructing
according
to
my
judgment
and
means
a
craft
which
would
be
best
adapted
to
all
weathers
and
all
circumstances
my
family
with
sympathetic
strength
pulling
hard
in
the
same
direction
seaworthiness
was
to
be
the
first
and
most
prominent
feature
in
our
microscopic
ship
next
to
this
good
quality
she
should
sail
well
at
least
before
free
winds
we
counted
on
favourable
winds
and
so
they
were
experienced
the
greater
part
of
the
voyage
that
soon
followed
long
exposures
and
many
and
severe
disappointments
by
this
time
i
found
had
told
on
health
and
nerve
through
long
quarantines
expensive
fumigations
and
ruinous
doctors
visits
which
had
swept
my
dollars
into
hands
other
than
mine
however
with
still
a
shot
in
the
locker
and
with
some
feelings
of
our
own
in
the
matter
of
how
we
should
get
home
i
say
we
set
to
work
with
tools
saved
from
the
wreck
a
meagre
kit
and
soon
found
ourselves
in
command
of
another
ship
which
i
will
describe
the
building
of
also
the
dimensions
and
the
model
and
rig
first
naming
the
tools
with
which
it
was
made
to
begin
with
we
had
an
axe
an
adze
and
two
saws
one
auger
one
and
one
two
large
which
we
converted
into
nailing
bits
one
roper
that
answered
for
a
punch
and
most
precious
of
all
a
file
that
we
found
in
an
old
washed
up
on
the
beach
a
square
we
readily
made
two
splints
of
bamboo
wood
served
as
compasses
charcoal
pounded
as
fine
as
flour
and
mixed
in
water
took
the
place
of
chalk
for
the
line
the
latter
we
had
on
hand
in
cases
where
holes
larger
than
the
bit
were
required
a
piece
of
small
iron
was
heated
and
with
this
we
could
burn
a
hole
to
any
size
required
so
we
had
after
all
quite
a
kit
to
go
on
with
clamps
such
as
are
used
by
boat
builders
we
had
not
but
made
substitutes
from
the
crooked
guava
tree
and
from
wood
trees
from
the
neighbouring
forest
were
felled
when
the
timber
from
the
wrecked
cargo
would
not
answer
some
of
these
woods
that
we
sought
for
special
purposes
had
queer
sounding
names
such
as
guanandee
etc
this
latter
we
did
not
use
the
saw
upon
at
all
it
being
very
hard
but
hewed
it
with
the
axe
bearing
in
mind
that
we
had
but
one
file
whereas
for
the
edged
tools
we
had
but
to
go
down
to
a
brook
hard
by
to
find
stones
in
abundance
suitable
to
sharpen
them
on
the
many
hindrances
encountered
in
the
building
of
the
boat
will
not
be
recounted
here
among
the
least
was
a
jungle
fever
from
which
we
suffered
considerably
but
all
that
and
all
other
obstacles
vanished
at
last
or
became
less
before
a
new
energy
which
grew
apace
with
the
boat
and
the
building
of
the
craft
went
rapidly
forward
there
was
no
short
day
system
but
we
rested
on
the
sabbath
or
surveyed
what
we
had
done
through
the
week
and
made
calculations
of
what
and
how
to
strike
on
the
coming
week
the
unskilled
part
of
the
labour
such
as
sawing
the
cedar
planks
of
which
she
was
mostly
made
was
done
by
the
natives
who
saw
in
a
rough
fashion
always
leaving
much
planing
and
straightening
to
be
done
in
order
to
adjust
the
timber
to
a
suitable
shape
the
planks
for
the
bottom
were
of
ironwood
x
inches
for
the
sides
and
top
red
cedar
was
used
each
plank
with
the
exception
of
two
reaching
the
whole
length
of
the
boat
this
arrangement
of
exceedingly
heavy
wood
in
the
bottom
and
the
light
on
top
contributed
much
to
the
stability
of
the
craft
the
ironwood
was
heavy
as
stone
while
the
cedar
being
light
and
elastic
lent
buoyancy
and
suppleness
all
that
we
could
wish
for
the
fastenings
we
gathered
up
in
various
places
some
from
the
bulwarks
of
the
wreck
some
from
the
hinges
of
doors
and
skylights
and
some
were
made
from
the
ship
metal
sheathing
which
the
natives
melted
and
cast
into
nails
pure
copper
nails
also
were
procured
from
the
natives
some
ten
for
which
i
paid
in
copper
coins
at
the
rate
of
two
of
coin
for
one
of
nails
the
same
kind
of
coins
called
cut
into
pieces
with
holes
punched
through
them
entered
into
the
fastenings
as
burrs
for
the
nails
a
number
of
small
eyebolts
from
the
of
the
wreck
were
turned
to
account
for
lashing
bolts
in
the
deck
of
the
new
vessel
the
nails
when
too
long
were
cut
to
the
required
length
taking
care
that
the
ends
which
were
cut
off
should
not
be
wasted
but
remelted
along
with
the
metal
sheathing
into
other
nails
some
carriage
bolts
with
nuts
which
i
found
in
the
country
came
in
very
handy
these
i
adjusted
to
the
required
length
when
too
long
by
slipping
on
blocks
of
wood
of
the
required
thickness
to
take
up
the
surplus
length
putting
the
block
of
course
on
the
inside
and
the
nut
flush
with
the
planks
on
the
outside
then
screwing
from
the
inside
outward
they
were
drawn
together
and
there
held
as
in
a
vice
the
planks
being
put
together
fashion
which
without
doubt
is
the
strongest
way
to
build
a
boat
these
seventy
in
number
as
well
as
the
copper
nails
cost
us
dearly
but
wooden
pegs
with
which
also
she
was
fastened
cost
only
the
labour
of
being
made
the
lashings
too
that
we
used
here
and
there
about
the
frame
of
the
cabin
cost
next
to
nothing
being
made
from
the
fibrous
bark
of
trees
which
could
be
had
in
abundance
by
the
stripping
of
it
off
so
taking
it
by
and
large
our
materials
were
not
expensive
the
principal
item
being
the
timber
which
cost
about
three
cents
per
superficial
foot
sawed
or
hewed
rosewood
ironwood
cedar
or
mahogany
were
all
about
the
same
price
and
very
little
in
advance
of
common
wood
so
of
course
we
selected
always
the
best
the
labour
of
shaping
being
least
sometimes
where
the
best
materials
were
used
these
various
timbers
and
fastenings
put
together
as
best
we
could
shape
and
join
them
made
a
craft
sufficiently
strong
and
seaworthy
to
withstand
all
the
bufferings
on
the
main
upon
which
in
due
course
she
was
launched
the
hull
being
completed
by
various
other
contrivances
and
makeshifts
in
which
sometimes
the
wooden
blacksmith
was
called
in
to
assist
and
the
mother
of
invention
also
lending
a
hand
fixtures
were
made
which
served
as
well
on
the
voyage
as
though
made
in
a
dockyard
and
at
great
cost
my
builders
baulked
at
nothing
and
on
the
day
of
may
the
day
on
which
the
slaves
of
brazil
were
set
free
our
craft
was
launched
and
was
named
liberty
her
dimensions
being
feet
in
length
over
all
feet
breadth
of
beam
and
feet
depth
of
hold
who
shall
say
that
she
was
not
large
enough
her
model
i
got
from
my
recollections
of
cape
ann
dories
and
from
a
photo
of
a
very
elegant
japanese
which
i
had
before
me
on
the
spot
so
as
it
might
be
expected
when
finished
she
resembled
both
types
of
vessel
in
some
degree
her
rig
was
the
chinese
style
which
is
i
consider
the
most
convenient
boat
rig
in
the
whole
world
this
was
the
boat
or
canoe
i
prefer
to
call
it
in
which
we
purposed
to
sail
for
north
america
and
home
each
one
had
been
busy
during
the
construction
and
past
misfortunes
had
all
been
forgotten
madam
had
made
the
sails
and
very
good
sails
they
were
too
victor
the
carpenter
ropemaker
and
general
roustabout
had
performed
his
part
our
little
man
garfield
too
had
found
employment
in
holding
the
hammer
to
clinch
the
nails
and
giving
much
advice
on
the
coming
voyage
all
were
busy
i
say
and
no
one
had
given
a
thought
of
what
we
were
about
to
encounter
from
the
port
officials
farther
up
the
coast
it
was
pretended
by
them
that
a
passport
could
not
be
granted
to
so
small
a
craft
to
go
on
so
long
a
voyage
as
the
contemplated
one
to
north
america
then
fever
returned
to
the
writer
and
the
constructor
of
the
little
craft
and
i
was
forced
to
go
to
bed
remaining
there
three
days
finally
it
came
to
my
mind
that
in
part
of
a
medicine
chest
which
had
been
saved
from
the
wreck
was
stored
some
i
think
it
is
called
of
this
i
took
several
doses
small
ones
at
first
you
may
be
sure
and
the
good
effect
of
the
deadly
poison
on
the
malaria
in
my
system
was
soon
felt
trickling
through
my
veins
increasing
the
doses
somewhat
i
could
perceive
the
beneficial
effect
hour
by
hour
and
in
a
few
days
i
had
quite
recovered
from
the
malady
absurd
as
it
was
to
have
the
judgment
of
sailors
set
on
by
pollywog
navigators
we
had
still
to
submit
the
pollywogs
being
numerous
about
this
time
as
the
astrologers
say
a
messenger
came
down
from
the
custom
house
asking
me
to
repair
thither
at
midday
on
the
morrow
this
filled
me
with
alarm
true
the
messenger
has
delivered
his
message
in
the
politest
possible
manner
but
that
signified
nothing
since
brazilians
are
always
polite
this
thing
small
as
it
seems
now
came
near
sending
me
back
to
the
fever
what
had
i
done
i
went
up
next
day
after
having
nightmare
badly
all
night
prepared
to
say
that
i
would
do
it
again
the
kind
administrator
i
found
upon
presenting
myself
at
his
office
had
no
fault
to
charge
me
with
but
had
a
good
word
instead
the
little
he
observed
had
attracted
the
notice
of
his
people
and
his
own
curiosity
as
being
a
handsome
and
craft
this
and
many
other
flattering
expressions
were
vented
at
which
i
affected
surprise
but
secretly
said
i
think
you
are
right
sir
and
you
have
good
taste
too
if
you
are
a
customs
officer
the
drift
of
this
flattery
to
make
a
long
story
short
was
to
have
me
build
a
boat
for
the
or
his
government
not
allowing
money
to
build
new
pointing
to
one
which
certainly
would
require
new
keel
planks
ribs
stem
and
could
i
not
repair
one
to
this
proposition
i
begged
time
to
consider
flattering
as
the
officer
words
were
and
backed
by
the
offer
of
liberal
pay
so
long
as
the
boat
could
be
repaired
i
still
had
no
mind
to
remain
in
the
hot
country
and
risk
getting
the
fever
again
but
there
was
the
old
hitch
to
be
gotten
over
namely
the
passport
on
which
we
thought
depended
our
sailing
however
to
expedite
matters
a
fishing
licence
was
hit
upon
and
i
wondered
why
i
had
not
thought
of
that
before
having
been
once
upon
a
time
a
fisherman
myself
heading
thence
on
a
new
diplomatic
course
i
commenced
to
fit
ostensibly
for
a
fishing
voyage
to
this
end
a
fishing
net
was
made
which
would
be
a
good
thing
to
have
anyway
then
hooks
and
lines
were
rigged
and
a
cable
made
this
cable
or
rope
was
formed
from
vines
that
grow
very
long
on
the
just
above
tide
water
several
of
which
twisted
together
make
a
very
serviceable
rope
then
being
light
and
elastic
it
is
especially
adapted
for
a
boat
anchor
rope
or
for
the
storm
drag
ninety
fathoms
of
this
rope
was
made
for
us
by
the
natives
for
the
sum
of
ten
milreis
the
anchor
came
of
itself
almost
i
had
made
a
wooden
one
from
heavy
sinking
timber
but
a
stalwart
ranchman
coming
along
one
day
brought
a
boat
anchor
with
him
which
he
said
had
been
used
by
his
slaves
as
a
but
now
that
they
are
free
and
away
said
he
i
have
no
further
use
for
the
crooked
thing
a
which
had
served
to
stitch
the
sails
together
was
coveted
by
him
and
was
of
no
further
use
to
us
in
exchange
for
this
the
prized
anchor
was
readily
secured
the
owner
of
it
leaving
us
some
boot
into
the
bargain
things
working
thus
in
our
favour
the
wooden
anchor
was
stowed
away
to
be
kept
as
a
spare
bower
these
arrangements
completed
our
craft
took
on
the
appearance
of
a
fishing
smack
and
i
began
to
feel
somewhat
in
my
old
element
with
no
fear
of
the
lack
of
ways
and
means
when
we
should
arrive
on
our
own
coast
where
i
knew
of
fishing
banks
and
a
document
which
translated
read
a
licence
to
catch
fish
inside
and
outside
of
the
bar
was
readily
granted
by
the
port
authorities
how
far
outside
the
bar
may
this
carry
us
i
asked
sabe
said
the
officer
literally
translated
who
knows
but
in
spanish
or
portuguese
used
for
nobody
knows
or
i
care
adieu
señor
said
the
polite
official
we
will
meet
in
heaven
this
meant
you
can
go
since
you
insist
upon
it
but
i
must
not
officially
know
of
it
and
you
will
probably
go
to
the
bottom
in
this
he
and
many
others
were
mistaken
having
the
necessary
document
now
in
our
possession
we
commenced
to
take
in
stores
for
the
voyage
as
follows
lbs
flour
lbs
sugar
lbs
coffee
which
roasted
black
and
pounded
fine
as
wheaten
flour
was
equal
to
double
the
amount
as
prepared
in
north
america
and
afforded
us
a
much
more
delicious
cup
of
tea
we
had
lbs
pork
lbs
dried
beef
lbs
dried
codfish
lbs
bottles
of
honey
oranges
bunches
of
bananas
gallons
of
water
also
a
small
basket
of
yams
and
a
dozen
sticks
of
by
way
of
vegetables
our
medicine
chest
contained
brazil
nuts
pepper
and
cinnamon
no
other
medicines
or
condiments
were
required
on
the
voyage
except
table
salt
which
we
also
had
one
musket
and
a
carbine
which
had
already
stood
us
in
good
stead
together
with
ammunition
and
three
cutlasses
were
stowed
away
for
last
use
to
be
used
nevertheless
in
case
of
necessity
the
light
goods
i
stowed
in
the
ends
of
the
canoe
the
heavier
in
the
middle
and
along
the
bottom
thus
economizing
space
and
lending
to
the
stability
of
the
canoe
over
the
top
of
the
midship
stores
a
floor
was
made
which
housed
over
by
a
tarpaulin
roof
reaching
three
feet
above
the
deck
of
the
canoe
supported
by
a
frame
of
bamboo
gave
us
sitting
space
of
four
feet
from
the
floor
to
the
roof
and
twelve
feet
long
amidships
this
arrangement
of
cabin
in
the
centre
gave
my
passengers
a
berth
where
the
least
motion
would
be
felt
even
this
is
saying
but
little
for
best
we
could
do
to
avoid
it
we
had
still
to
accept
much
tossing
from
the
waves
precautionary
measures
were
taken
in
everything
so
far
as
our
resources
and
skill
could
reach
the
springy
and
buoyant
bamboo
was
used
wherever
stick
of
any
kind
was
required
such
as
the
frame
and
braces
for
the
cabin
yards
for
the
sails
and
finally
for
guard
on
her
top
sides
making
the
canoe
altogether
a
one
in
case
of
a
capsize
each
joint
in
the
bamboo
was
an
of
several
pounds
buoyant
capacity
and
we
had
a
thousand
joints
the
most
important
of
our
stores
particularly
the
flour
bread
and
coffee
were
hermetically
sealed
so
that
if
actually
turned
over
at
sea
our
craft
would
not
only
right
herself
but
would
bring
her
stores
right
side
up
in
good
order
and
it
then
would
be
only
a
question
of
baling
her
out
and
of
setting
her
again
on
her
course
when
we
would
come
on
as
right
as
ever
as
it
turned
out
however
no
such
trial
or
mishap
awaited
us
while
the
possibility
of
many
and
strange
occurrences
was
felt
by
all
of
us
the
danger
which
loomed
most
in
little
garfield
mind
was
that
of
the
sharks
a
fine
specimen
was
captured
on
the
voyage
showing
five
rows
of
pearly
teeth
as
sharp
as
lances
some
of
these
monsters
it
is
said
have
nine
rows
of
teeth
that
they
are
always
hungry
is
admitted
by
sailors
of
great
experience
how
it
is
that
sailors
can
go
in
bathing
as
they
often
do
in
the
face
of
a
danger
so
terrible
is
past
my
comprehension
their
business
is
to
face
danger
to
be
sure
but
this
is
a
needless
exposure
for
which
the
penalty
is
sometimes
a
life
the
second
mate
of
a
bark
on
the
coast
of
cuba
not
long
ago
was
bitten
in
twain
and
the
portions
swallowed
whole
by
a
monster
shark
that
he
had
tempted
in
this
way
the
shark
was
captured
soon
after
and
the
poor
fellow
remains
taken
out
of
the
revolting
maw
leaving
the
sharks
where
they
are
i
gladly
return
to
the
voyage
of
the
footnote
this
alternative
i
was
obliged
to
accept
or
bring
my
family
home
as
paupers
for
my
wealth
was
gone
need
i
explain
more
this
explanation
has
been
forced
from
me
illustration
the
chapter
x
across
the
bar
the
run
to
santos
tow
to
rio
by
the
steamship
at
rio
the
efficiency
of
our
canoe
was
soon
discovered
on
the
of
june
after
having
sailed
about
the
bay
some
few
days
to
temper
our
feelings
to
the
new
craft
and
shake
things
into
place
we
crossed
the
bar
and
stood
out
to
sea
while
six
vessels
lay
inside
that
is
to
say
by
their
pilots
it
was
thought
too
rough
to
venture
out
and
they
the
pilots
stood
on
the
point
as
we
put
out
to
sea
crossing
themselves
in
our
behalf
and
shouting
that
the
bar
was
but
the
stood
on
her
course
the
crew
never
regretting
it
the
wind
from
the
at
the
time
was
the
moderating
side
of
a
which
had
brought
in
a
heavy
swell
from
the
ocean
that
broke
and
thundered
on
the
bar
with
deafening
roar
and
grand
display
of
majestic
effort
but
our
little
ship
bounded
through
the
breakers
like
a
fish
as
natural
to
the
elements
and
as
free
of
all
the
seas
that
broke
furiously
about
her
that
day
often
standing
her
on
end
not
one
swept
over
or
even
boarded
her
and
she
finally
came
through
the
storm
of
breakers
in
triumph
then
squaring
away
before
the
wind
she
spread
her
willing
sails
and
flew
onward
like
a
bird
it
required
confidence
and
some
courage
to
face
the
first
storm
in
so
small
a
bark
after
having
been
years
in
large
ships
but
it
would
have
required
more
courage
than
was
possessed
by
any
of
us
to
turn
back
since
thoughts
of
home
had
taken
hold
on
our
minds
then
too
the
old
boating
trick
came
back
fresh
to
me
the
love
of
the
thing
itself
gaining
on
me
as
the
little
ship
stood
out
and
my
crew
with
one
voice
said
go
on
the
heavy
south
atlantic
swell
rolling
in
upon
the
coast
as
we
sped
along
toppled
over
when
it
reached
the
ten
fathom
line
and
broke
into
roaring
combers
which
forbade
our
nearer
approach
to
the
land
evidently
our
safest
course
was
away
from
the
shore
and
out
where
the
swelling
seas
though
grand
were
regular
and
raced
under
our
little
craft
that
danced
like
a
mite
on
the
ocean
as
she
drove
forward
in
hours
from
the
time
paranagua
bar
was
crossed
we
were
up
with
santos
heads
a
run
of
miles
a
squall
of
wind
burst
on
us
through
a
gulch
as
we
swept
round
the
heads
tearing
our
sails
into
shreds
and
sending
us
into
santos
under
bare
poles
chancing
then
upon
an
old
friend
the
mail
steamship
capt
baker
about
to
sail
for
rio
the
end
of
a
friendly
line
was
extended
to
us
and
we
were
towed
by
the
stout
steamer
toward
rio
the
next
day
as
fast
as
we
could
wish
to
go
my
wife
and
youngest
sailor
took
passage
on
the
steamer
while
victor
remained
in
the
canoe
with
me
and
stood
by
with
axe
in
hand
to
cut
the
if
the
case
should
require
it
and
i
steered
look
out
said
baker
as
the
steamer
began
to
move
ahead
look
out
that
i
do
snake
that
canoe
out
from
under
you
go
on
with
your
mails
baker
was
all
i
could
say
do
blow
up
your
ship
with
my
wife
and
son
on
board
and
i
will
look
out
for
the
packet
on
the
other
end
of
the
rope
baker
opened
her
up
to
thirteen
knots
but
the
held
on
the
line
that
we
towed
with
was
inches
in
diameter
by
ninety
fathoms
long
this
at
times
when
the
steamer
surged
over
seas
leaving
the
canoe
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
wave
astern
would
become
as
taut
as
a
at
other
times
it
would
slacken
and
sink
limp
in
a
bight
under
the
forefoot
but
only
for
a
moment
however
when
the
next
great
plunge
ahead
would
snap
it
taut
again
pulling
us
along
with
a
heavy
trembling
jerk
under
the
circumstances
straight
steering
was
imperative
for
a
sheer
to
port
or
starboard
would
have
finished
the
career
of
the
by
sending
her
under
the
sea
therefore
the
trick
of
twenty
hours
fell
to
me
the
oldest
and
most
experienced
helmsman
but
i
was
all
right
and
not
until
baker
cast
oil
upon
the
troubled
waters
i
soon
got
tired
of
that
victor
was
under
the
canvas
covering
with
the
axe
still
in
hand
ready
to
cut
the
line
which
was
so
arranged
that
he
could
reach
it
from
within
and
cut
instantly
if
by
mischance
the
canoe
should
take
a
sheer
i
was
afraid
that
the
lad
would
become
sleepy
and
putting
his
head
under
his
wing
for
a
nap
would
forget
his
post
but
my
frequent
cry
stand
by
there
victor
found
him
always
on
hand
though
complaining
somewhat
of
the
dizzy
motion
heavy
sprays
dashed
over
me
at
the
helm
which
however
seeming
to
wash
away
the
sulphur
and
brimstone
smoke
of
many
a
quarantine
brought
enjoyment
to
my
mind
confused
waves
rose
about
us
high
and
dangerous
often
high
above
the
gunwale
of
the
canoe
but
her
shapely
curves
balanced
her
well
and
she
rode
over
them
all
in
safety
this
canoe
ride
was
thrilling
and
satisfactory
to
us
all
it
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
we
had
in
this
little
craft
a
most
extraordinary
for
the
tow
was
a
thorough
test
of
her
seaworthiness
the
captain
of
the
steamer
ordered
oil
cast
over
from
time
to
time
relieving
us
of
much
spray
and
sloppy
motion
but
adding
to
discomforts
of
taste
to
me
at
the
helm
for
much
of
the
oil
blew
over
me
and
in
my
face
said
the
captain
to
one
of
his
mates
an
old
whaler
by
the
way
and
whalers
for
some
unaccountable
reason
have
never
too
much
regard
for
a
poor
merchantman
mr
smith
aye
aye
sir
answered
old
smith
smith
hoist
out
that
oil
aye
aye
sir
said
the
old
blubberhunter
in
high
glee
as
he
went
about
it
with
alacrity
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
from
the
time
the
order
was
given
i
was
smothering
in
grease
and
our
boat
was
oiled
from
keel
to
truck
she
all
right
now
said
smith
that
all
right
said
baker
but
i
thought
it
all
wrong
the
wind
meanwhile
was
in
our
teeth
and
before
we
crossed
rio
bar
i
had
swallowed
enough
oil
to
cure
any
amount
of
consumption
baker
i
have
heard
said
he
would
care
much
if
he
should
drown
slocum
but
i
was
all
right
so
long
as
the
canoe
did
sheer
and
we
arrived
at
rio
safe
and
sound
after
the
most
exciting
of
my
life
i
was
bound
not
to
cut
the
line
that
towed
us
so
well
and
i
knew
that
baker
would
let
it
go
for
it
was
his
rope
i
found
at
rio
that
my
fishing
licence
could
be
exchanged
for
a
pass
of
greater
import
this
document
had
to
be
procured
through
the
office
of
the
minister
of
marine
many
a
smart
linguist
was
ready
to
use
his
influence
on
my
behalf
with
the
high
official
but
i
found
at
the
end
of
a
month
that
i
was
making
headway
about
as
fast
as
a
dutch
galliot
in
a
head
sea
after
the
wind
had
subsided
our
worthy
consul
general
clay
armstrong
gave
me
a
hint
of
what
the
difficulty
was
and
how
to
obviate
it
i
then
went
about
the
business
myself
as
i
should
have
done
at
first
and
i
found
those
at
the
various
departments
who
were
willing
to
help
me
without
the
intervention
of
outside
influence
commander
marquis
of
the
brazilian
navy
recommended
me
to
his
excellency
the
minister
of
marine
out
of
regard
he
said
for
american
seamen
and
when
the
new
document
came
it
was
and
had
on
it
seal
as
big
as
a
soup
a
port
naval
officer
then
presented
me
to
the
good
who
also
gave
me
a
with
the
seal
of
the
i
had
now
only
to
procure
a
bill
of
health
when
i
should
have
papers
enough
for
a
rio
being
considered
a
healthy
place
this
was
readily
granted
making
our
equipment
complete
i
met
here
our
minister
whose
office
with
other
duties
is
to
keep
a
lifting
in
the
interest
of
that
orphan
the
american
ship
alas
my
poor
relation
said
he
captain
if
your
be
as
good
as
your
papers
documents
given
me
by
the
brazilian
officials
you
may
get
there
all
right
adding
well
if
the
boat
ever
reaches
home
she
will
be
a
great
curiosity
the
meaning
of
which
i
could
readily
infer
was
and
your
chances
for
a
snap
in
a
dime
museum
will
be
good
this
after
many
years
of
experience
as
an
american
shipmaster
and
also
shipowner
in
a
moderate
way
was
interesting
encouragement
by
our
brazilian
friends
however
the
voyage
was
looked
upon
as
a
success
already
achieved
the
utmost
confidence
said
the
journal
opiz
of
rio
is
placed
in
the
audacious
american
mariner
and
we
expect
in
a
short
time
to
hear
proclaimed
in
all
of
the
journals
of
the
old
and
new
world
the
safe
arrival
of
this
wonderful
little
craft
at
her
destination

a

july
was
the
day
as
i
have
said
on
which
we
sailed
from
rio
de
janeiro
meeting
with
head
winds
and
light
withal
through
the
day
we
made
but
little
progress
and
finally
when
night
came
on
we
anchored
twenty
miles
east
of
rio
heads
near
the
shore
long
rolling
seas
rocked
us
as
they
raced
by
then
dashing
their
great
bodies
against
defying
rocks
made
music
by
which
we
slept
that
night
but
a
trouble
unthought
of
before
came
up
in
garfield
mind
before
going
to
his
bunk
mamma
cried
he
as
our
little
bark
rose
and
fell
on
the
heavy
waves
tumbling
the
young
sailor
about
from
side
to
side
in
the
small
quarters
while
he
knelt
seriously
at
his
evening
devotion
mamma
this
boat
is
big
enough
to
pray
in
but
this
difficulty
was
gotten
over
in
time
and
garfield
learned
to
watch
as
well
as
to
pray
on
the
voyage
and
full
of
faith
that
all
would
be
well
laid
him
down
nights
and
slept
as
restfully
as
any
christian
on
sea
or
land
by
daylight
of
the
second
day
we
were
again
underweigh
beating
to
the
eastward
against
the
old
head
wind
and
head
sea
on
the
following
night
we
kept
her
at
it
and
the
next
day
made
cape
frio
where
we
anchored
near
the
entrance
to
a
good
harbour
time
from
rio
two
days
distance
miles
the
wind
and
tide
being
adverse
compelled
us
to
wait
outside
for
a
favourable
change
while
comfortably
anchored
at
this
place
a
huge
whale
nosing
about
came
up
under
the
canoe
giving
us
a
toss
and
a
great
scare
we
were
at
dinner
when
it
happened
the
meal
it
is
needless
to
say
was
finished
without
dessert
the
great
sea
animal
fifty
to
sixty
feet
long
circling
around
our
small
craft
looked
terribly
big
he
was
so
close
to
me
twice
as
he
swam
round
and
round
the
canoe
that
i
could
have
touched
him
either
time
with
a
paddle
his
flukes
stirring
the
water
like
a
steamer
propeller
appeared
alarmingly
close
and
powerful
and
what
an
ugly
mouth
the
monster
had
well
we
expected
instant
annihilation
the
fate
of
the
stout
came
vividly
before
me
the
voyage
of
the
i
thought
was
about
ended
and
i
looked
about
for
pieces
of
bamboo
on
which
to
land
my
wife
and
family
just
then
however
to
the
infinite
relief
of
all
of
us
the
leviathan
moved
off
without
doing
us
much
harm
having
felt
satisfied
perhaps
that
we
had
no
jonah
on
board
we
lost
an
anchor
through
the
incident
and
received
some
small
damage
to
the
keel
but
no
other
injury
was
done
even
this
i
believe
upon
second
thought
was
unintentional
done
in
playfulness
only
a
shark
can
take
a
joke
it
is
said
and
crack
one
too
but
for
broad
rippling
humour
the
whale
has
no
equal
if
this
be
a
sample
of
our
adventures
in
the
beginning
thought
i
we
shall
have
enough
and
to
spare
by
the
end
of
the
voyage
a
visit
from
this
quarter
had
not
been
counted
on
but
sancho
panza
says
when
least
aware
starts
the
hare
which
in
our
case
by
the
by
was
a
great
whale
when
our
breath
came
back
and
the
hair
on
our
heads
settled
to
a
normal
level
we
set
sail
and
dodged
about
under
the
lee
of
the
cape
till
a
cove
with
a
very
enticing
sand
beach
at
the
head
of
it
opened
before
us
some
three
miles
northwest
of
where
we
lost
the
anchor
in
the
remarkable
adventure
with
the
whale
the
spare
bower
was
soon
bent
to
the
cable
then
we
stood
in
and
anchored
near
a
cliff
over
which
was
a
leading
in
the
direction
of
a
small
fishing
village
about
a
mile
away
sheering
the
boat
in
to
the
rocky
side
of
the
cove
which
was
steep
to
we
leaped
out
warp
in
hand
and
made
fast
to
a
boulder
above
the
tidal
flow
then
scrambling
over
the
cliff
we
repaired
to
the
village
first
improvising
a
spare
anchor
from
three
sticks
and
a
stone
which
answered
the
purpose
quite
well
judging
at
once
that
we
were
strangers
the
villagers
came
out
to
meet
us
and
made
a
stir
at
home
to
entertain
us
in
the
most
hospitable
manner
after
the
custom
of
the
country
and
with
the
villagers
was
a
gentleman
from
canada
a
newkirk
who
as
we
learned
was
engaged
when
the
sea
was
smooth
in
recovering
treasure
that
was
lost
near
the
cape
in
the
british
warship
which
was
wrecked
there
in
the
treasure
some
millions
in
silver
coins
and
gold
in
bars
from
peru
for
england
was
dumped
in
the
cove
which
has
since
taken
the
name
of
the
ship
that
bore
it
there
and
as
i
have
said
came
to
grief
in
that
place
which
is
on
the
west
shore
near
the
end
of
the
cape
some
of
the
coins
were
given
to
us
to
be
treasured
as
souvenirs
of
the
pleasant
visit
we
found
in
newkirk
a
versatile
roving
genius
he
had
been
a
schoolmaster
at
home
captain
of
a
lake
schooner
once
had
practised
medicine
and
preached
some
i
think
and
what
else
i
do
not
know
he
had
tried
many
things
for
a
living
but
like
the
proverbial
moving
stone
had
failed
to
accumulate
matters
said
the
canadian
were
getting
worse
and
worse
even
till
finally
to
keep
my
head
above
water
i
was
forced
to
go
under
the
sea
and
he
had
struck
it
rich
it
would
seem
if
gold
being
brought
in
by
the
was
any
sign
this
man
of
many
adventures
still
spoke
like
a
youngster
no
one
had
told
him
that
he
was
growing
old
he
talked
of
going
home
as
soon
as
the
balance
of
the
treasure
was
secured
just
to
see
his
dear
old
mother
who
by
the
way
was
years
old
when
he
left
home
some
twenty
years
before
since
his
last
news
from
home
nearly
two
decades
had
gone
by
he
was
the
youngest
of
a
family
of
eighteen
children
all
living
he
said
though
added
he
our
family
came
near
being
made
one
less
yesterday
by
a
whale
which
i
thought
would
eat
my
boat
crew
money
and
all
as
he
came
toward
us
with
open
mouth
by
a
back
stroke
of
the
oars
however
we
managed
to
cheat
him
out
of
his
dinner
if
that
was
what
he
was
after
and
i
think
it
was
but
here
i
am
he
cried
all
right
and
might
have
added
wealthy
after
all
after
hearing
the
diver
story
i
related
in
portuguese
our
own
adventure
of
the
same
day
and
probably
with
the
same
whale
the
monster
having
gone
in
the
direction
of
the
diver
boat
the
astonishment
of
the
listeners
was
great
but
when
they
learned
of
our
intended
voyage
to
do
they
crossed
themselves
and
asked
god
to
lend
us
grace
is
north
america
near
new
york
asked
the
village
merchant
who
owned
all
the
boats
and
nets
of
the
place
why
america
is
new
york
answered
the
i
thought
so
said
the
merchant
and
no
doubt
he
thought
some
of
us
very
stupid
or
rude
or
both
but
in
spite
of
manners
i
had
to
smile
at
the
assuring
air
of
the
canadian
why
did
you
not
answer
him
correctly
i
asked
of
the
i
answered
him
said
newkirk
according
to
his
folly
had
i
corrected
his
rusty
geography
before
these
simple
impoverished
fishermen
he
would
not
soon
forgive
me
and
as
for
the
rest
of
the
poor
souls
here
the
knowledge
would
do
them
but
little
good
i
may
mention
that
in
this
place
there
were
no
schools
and
except
the
little
knowledge
gained
in
their
church
from
the
catechism
and
from
the
fumbling
of
beads
they
were
the
most
innocent
of
this
world
scheme
of
any
people
i
ever
met
but
they
seemed
to
know
all
about
heaven
and
were
no
doubt
happy
after
the
brief
friendly
chat
that
we
had
coffee
was
passed
around
the
probabilities
of
the
voyage
discussed
and
the
crew
cautioned
against
the
dangers
of
the
whale
which
were
numerous
along
the
coast
and
vicious
at
that
season
of
the
year
having
their
young
to
protect
i
realized
very
often
the
startling
sensation
alone
of
a
night
at
the
helm
of
having
a
painful
stillness
broken
by
these
leviathans
bursting
the
surface
of
the
water
with
a
noise
like
the
roar
of
a
great
sea
uncomfortably
near
reminding
me
of
the
cape
frio
adventure
and
my
crew
i
am
sure
were
not
less
sensitive
to
the
same
feeling
of
an
awful
danger
however
imaginary
one
night
in
particular
dark
and
foggy
i
remember
victor
called
me
excitedly
saying
that
something
dreadful
ahead
and
drawing
rapidly
near
had
frightened
him
it
proved
to
be
a
whale
for
some
reason
that
i
could
only
guess
at
threshing
the
sea
with
its
huge
body
and
surging
about
in
all
directions
so
that
it
puzzled
me
to
know
which
way
to
steer
to
go
clear
i
thought
at
first
from
the
rumpus
made
that
a
fight
was
going
on
such
as
we
had
once
witnessed
from
the
deck
of
the
not
far
from
this
place
our
course
was
changed
as
soon
as
we
could
decide
which
way
to
avoid
if
possible
all
marine
disturbers
of
the
peace
we
wished
especially
to
keep
away
from
infuriated
swordfish
which
i
feared
might
be
darting
about
and
be
apt
to
give
us
a
blind
thrust
knowing
that
they
sometimes
pierce
stout
ships
through
with
their
formidable
weapons
i
began
to
feel
ticklish
about
the
ribs
myself
i
confess
and
the
little
watch
below
too
got
uneasy
and
sleepless
for
one
of
these
swords
they
knew
well
would
reach
through
and
through
our
little
boat
from
keel
to
deck
large
ships
have
occasionally
been
sent
into
port
leaky
from
the
stab
of
a
sword
but
what
i
most
dreaded
was
the
possibility
of
one
of
us
being
ourselves
pinned
in
the
boat
a
swordfish
once
pierced
a
through
the
planking
and
through
the
solid
frame
timber
and
the
thick
ceiling
with
his
sword
leaving
it
there
a
valuable

to
be

with
the

in

of
a

having
now
doubled

a
prominent
point
in

and
having
had
the
seaworthiness
of
our
little

thoroughly
tested

already
told
and
seeing
moreover
that
we
had
nothing
to
fear
from
common
small

one
of
its

monsters
having
failed

we
stood
on
with
greater
confidence
than
ever
but
watchful
nevertheless
for
any
strange

that
might
happen
a

hurried
us
on
under
shortened

toward
the
softer

of

veering
to

sweeping
by

the

sometimes
standing
on

and
sometimes
buried
in

of

we
sunk
the

soon
out
of

and
stood
on
with
flowing
sheet
the
wind
on
the
following
day
settled
into
regular
trades
and
our
cedar
canoe
skipped
briskly
along
over
friendly
seas
that
were
leaping
toward
home
doffing
their
crests
onward
and
forward
but
never
back
and
the
splashing
waves
against
her
sides
then
rippling
along
the
thin
cedar
planks
between
the

and

vibrated
enchanting
music
to
the
ear
while
confidence
grew
in
the
bark
that
was
homeward
bound
but
coming
upon
coral
reefs
of
a
dark
night
while
we
listened
to
the
dismal
tune
of
the
seas
breaking
over
them
with
an
eternal
roar
how
intensely
lonesome
they
were
no
sign
of
any
living
thing
in
sight
except
perhaps
the
phosphorescent
streaks
of
a
hungry
shark
which
told
of
bad
company
in
our
wake
and
made
the
gloom
of
the
place
more
dismal
still
one
night
we
made
shelter
under
the
lee
of
the
extensive
reefs
called
the
paredes
walls
without
seeing
the
breakers
at
all
in
the
dark
although
they
were
not
far
in
the
distance
at
another
time
dragging
on
sail
to
clear
a
lee
shore
of
a
dark
and
stormy
night
we
came
suddenly
into
smooth
water
where
we
cast
anchor
and
furled
our
sails
lying
in
a
magic
harbour
till
daylight
the
next
morning
when
we
found
ourselves
among
a
maze
of
ugly
reefs
with
high
seas
breaking
over
them
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
on
all
sides
except
at
the
small
entrance
to
the
place
that
we
had
stumbled
into
in
the
night
the
position
of
this
future
harbour
is
south
lat
and
west
long
from
greenwich
we
named
the
place
port
liberdade
the
next
places
sighted
were
the
treacherous
abrohles
and
the
village
of
caravellas
back
of
the
reef
where
upon
refitting
i
found
that
a
chicken
cost
a
thousand
reis
a
bunch
of
bananas
four
hundred
reis
but
where
a
dozen
limes
cost
only
twenty
reis
one
cent
much
whaling
gear
lay
strewn
about
the
place
and
on
the
beach
was
the
carcass
of
a
whale
about
nine
days
slain
also
leaning
against
a
boat
was
a
fisherman
boat
and
man
relics
of
new
bedford
employed
at
this
station
in
their
familiar
industry
the
old
man
was
and
thinly
clad
after
the
custom
in
this
climate
still
i
recognized
the
fisherman
and
sailor
in
the
set
and
rig
of
the
few
duds
he
had
on
and
the
ample
straw
hat

breakfast
that
he
wore
and
doffed
in
a
manner
upon
our
first
salute
do

said
an
affable
native
close
by
pointing
at
the
same
time
to
that
son
of
the
sea
of
north
america
by
way
of
introduction
as
soon
as
it
was
learned
that
we
too
were
of
that
country
i
tried
to
learn
from
this
ancient
mariner
the
cause
of
his
being
stranded
in
this
strange
land
he
may
have
been
cast
up
there
by
the
whale
for
aught
i
could
learn
to
the
contrary
choosing
a
berth
well
to
windward
of
the
dead
whale
the
one
that
landed
the
old
man
of
the
sea
there
maybe
we
anchored
for
the
night
put
a
light
in
the
rigging
and
turned
in
next
morning
the
village
was
astir
betimes
canoes
were
being
put
afloat
and
the
rattle
of
poles
paddles
bait
boxes
and
many
more
things
for
the
daily
trip
that
were
being
hastily
put
into
each
canoe
echoed
back
from
the
tall
palm
groves
notes
of
busy
life
telling
us
that
it
was
time
to
weigh
anchor
and
be
sailing
to
this
cheerful
tune
we
lent
ear
and
hastening
to
be
underweigh
were
soon
clear
of
the
port
then
skimming
along
near
the
beach
in
the
early
morning
our
sails
spread
to
a
land
breeze
laden
with
fragrance
from
the
tropic
forest
and
the
music
of
many
songsters
we
sailed
in
great
felicity
dreading
no
dangers
from
the
sea
for
there
were
none
now
to
dread
or
fear
proceeding
forward
through
this
belt
of
moderate
winds
fanned
by
alternating
land
and
sea
breezes
we
drew
on
toward
a
region
of
high
that
reach
sometimes
the
dignity
of
a
gale
it
was
no
surprise
therefore
after
days
of
sailing
to
be
met
by
a
storm
which
so
happened
as
to
drive
us
into
the
indifferent
anchorage
of
paulo
thirty
miles
from
bahia
where
we
remained
two
days
for
shelter
time
three
days
from
caravellas
distance
sailed
miles
a
few
fishermen
lounged
about
the
place
living
apparently
in
wretched
poverty
spending
their
time
between
waiting
for
the
tide
to
go
out
when
it
was
in
and
waiting
for
it
to
come
in
when
it
was
out
to
float
a
canoe
or
bring
fish
to
their
shiftless
nets
this
indeed
seemed
their
only
concern
in
life
while
their
houses
forsaken
of
the
adobe
that
once
clung
to
the
wicker
walls
stood
grinning
in
rows
like
emblems
of
our
mortality
we
found
at
this
paulo
anything
but
saints
the
wretched
place
should
be
avoided
by
strangers
unless
driven
there
for
shelter
as
we
ourselves
were
by
stress
of
weather
we
left
the
place
on
the
first
lull
of
the
wind
having
been
threatened
by
an
attack
from
a
gang
of
rough
fellows
who
rudely
came
on
board
jostling
about
and
jabbering
in
a
dialect
which
however
i
happened
to
understand
i
got
rid
of
them
by
the
use
of
my
broken
portuguese
and
once
away
i
was
resolved
that
they
should
stay
away
i
was
not
mistaken
in
my
suspicions
that
they
would
return
and
try
to
come
aboard
which
shortly
afterward
they
did
but
my
resolution
to
keep
them
off
was
not
shaken
i
let
them
know
in
their
own
jargon
this
time
that
i
was
well
armed
they
finally
paddled
back
to
the
shore
and
all
visiting
was
then
ended
we
stood
a
good
watch
that
night
and
by
daylight
next
morning
put
to
sea
standing
out
in
a
heavy
swell
the
character
of
which
i
knew
better
and
could
trust
to
more
confidently
than
a
harbour
among
treacherous
natives
early
in
the
same
day
we
arrived
at
do
todos
all
saints
bay
a
charming
port
with
a
rich
surrounding
country
it
was
from
this
port
by
the
way
that
robinson
crusoe
sailed
for
africa
to
procure
slaves
for
his
plantation
and
that
of
his
friend
so
fiction
relates
at
bahia
we
met
many
friends
and
gentle
folk
not
the
least
interesting
at
this
port
are
the
negro
lasses
of
fine
physique
seen
at
the
markets
and
in
the
streets
with
burdens
on
their
heads
of
baskets
of
fruit
or
jars
of
water
which
they
balance
with
ease
and
grace
as
they
go
sweeping
by
with
that
stately
mien
which
the
dusky
maiden
can
call
her
own
chapter

at
bahia
meditations
on
the
discoverers
the
caribbees
at
bahia
we
refitted
with
many
necessary
provisions
and
repaired
the
keel
which
we
found
upon
hauling
out
had
been
damaged
by
the
encounter
with
the
whale
at
frio
an
iron
shoe
was
now
added
for
the
benefit
of
all
marine
monsters
wishing
to
scratch
their
backs
on
our
canoe
among
the
many
friends
whom
we
met
at
bahia
were
capt
boyd
and
his
family
of
the
bark
we
shall
meet
the
and
the
boyds
again
on
the
voyage
they
were
old
traders
to
south
america
and
had
many
friends
at
this
port
who
combined
to
make
our
visit
a
pleasant
one
and
their
little
son
rupert
was
greatly
taken
with
the
as
he
called
her
coming
often
to
see
us
and
the
officials
of
the
port
taking
great
interest
in
our
voyage
came
often
on
board
no
one
could
have
treated
us
more
kindly
than
they
the
venerable
himself
gave
us
special
welcome
to
the
port
and
a
kind
word
upon
our
departure
accompanied
by
a
present
for
my
wife
in
the
shape
of
a
rare
white
flower
which
we
cherished
greatly
as
coming
from
a
true
gentleman
some
strong
abolitionists
at
the
port
would
have
us
dine
in
an
epicurean
way
in
commemoration
of
the
name
given
our
canoe
which
was
adopted
because
of
her
having
been
put
afloat
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
may
the
day
on
which
every
human
being
in
brazil
could
say
i
have
no
master
but
one
i
declined
the
banquet
tendered
us
having
work
on
hand
fortifying
the
canoe
against
the
ravaging
worms
of
the
seas
we
were
yet
to
sail
through
bearing
in
mind
the
straits
of
my
great
predecessor
from
this
as
well
as
other
causes
on
his
voyage
over
the
caribbean
seas
i
was
bound
to
be
strengthened
against
the
enemy
the
gout
it
will
be
remembered
seized
upon
the
good
columbus
while
his
ship
had
worms
when
both
ship
and
admiral
lay
stranded
among
menacing
savages
surrounded
too
by
a
lawless
threatening
band
of
his
own
countrymen
not
less
treacherous
than
the
worst
of
cannibals
his
state
was
critical
indeed
one
calamity
was
from
living
this
i
was
bound
to
guard
against
the
other
was
from
neglect
on
the
part
of
his
people
to
care
for
the
ship
in
a
manner
of
the
latter
difficulty
i
had
no
risk
to
run
lazy
and
lawless
but
through
the
pretext
of
religion
the
infected
crew
wrought
on
the
pious
feelings
of
the
good
admiral
inducing
him
at
every
landing
to
hold
mass
instead
of
cleaning
the
foul
ship
thus
through
petty
intrigue
and
grave
neglects
they
brought
disaster
and
sorrow
on
their
leader
and
confusion
on
their
own
heads
their
religion
never
deep
could
not
be
expected
to
keep
from
the
ship
bottom
so
her
timbers
were
ravished
and
ruin
came
to
them
all
poor
columbus
had
he
but
sailed
with
his
son
diego
and
his
noble
brother
bartholomew
for
his
only
crew
and
companions
not
forgetting
the
help
of
a
good
woman
america
would
have
been
discovered
without
those
harrowing
tales
of
woe
and
indeed
heartrending
calamities
which
followed
in
the
wake
of
his
designing
people
nor
would
his
ship
have
been
less
well
manned
than
was
the
sailing
centuries
after
over
the
same
sea
and
among
many
of
the
islands
visited
by
the
great
discoverer
sailing
too
without
serious
accident
of
any
kind
and
without
sickness
or
discontent
our
advantage
over
columbus
i
say
was
very
great
not
more
from
the
possession
of
data
of
the
centuries
which
had
passed
than
from
having
a
willing
crew
sailing
without
dissent
or
murmur
sailing
in
the
same
boat
as
it
were
a
pensive
mood
comes
over
one
voyaging
among
the
scenes
of
the
new
world
early
to
us
while
on
this
canoe
voyage
of
pleasant
recollection
the
fancied
experience
of
navigators
gone
before
was
intensely
thrilling
sailing
among
islands
clothed
in
eternal
green
the
same
that
columbus
beheld
with
marvellous
anticipations
and
the
venerable
las
casas
had
looked
upon
with
pious
wonder
brought
us
in
the
mind
eye
near
the
old
discoverers
and
a
feeling
that
we
should
come
suddenly
upon
their
ships
around
some
near
headland
took
deep
hold
upon
our
thoughts
as
we
drew
in
with
the
shores
all
was
there
to
please
the
imagination
and
dream
over
in
the
same
balmy
sleepy
atmosphere
where
juan
ponce
de
leon
would
fain
have
tarried
young
but
found
death
rapid
working
side
by
side
with
ever
springing
life
to
live
long
in
this
clime
one
must
obey
great
nature
laws
so
stout
juan
and
millions
since
have
found
and
so
always
it
will
be
all
was
there
to
testify
as
of
yore
all
except
the
first
owners
of
the
land
they
alas
the
poor
caribbees
together
with
their
camp
fires
had
been
extinguished
long
years
before
and
no
one
of
human
sympathy
can
read
of
the
cruel
tortures
and
final
extermination
of
these
islanders
savages
though
they
were
without
a
pang
of
regret
at
the
unpleasant

along

part
of
the
brazilian
coast
fanned
by
constant
nothing
unusual
occurred
to
disturb
our
peace
or
daily
course
and
we
pressed
forward
night
and
day
as
was
our
wont
from
the
first
victor
and
i
stood
watch
and
watch
at
sea
usually
four
hours
each
the
most
difficult
of
our
experiences
in
fine
weather
was
the
intense
drowsiness
brought
on
by
constantly
watching
the
oscillating
compass
at
night
even
in
the
daytime
this
motion
would
make
one
sleepy
we
soon
found
it
necessary
to
arrange
a
code
of
signals
which
would
communicate
between
the
tiller
and
the
man
forward
this
was
accomplished
by
means
of
a
line
or
messenger
extending
from
one
to
the
other
which
was
understood
by
the
number
of
pulls
given
by
it
three
pulls
for
instance
meant
turn
out
one
in
response
aye
aye
i
am
awake
and
what
is
it
that
is
wanted
one
pull
in
return
signified
that
it
was
eight
bells
and
so
on
but
three
quick
jerks
meant
tumble
out
and
shorten
sail
victor
it
was
understood
would
tie
the
line
to
his
arm
or
leg
when
he
turned
in
so
that
by
pulling
i
would
be
sure
to
arouse
him
or
bring
him
somewhat
unceremoniously
out
of
his
bunk
once
however
the
messenger
failed
to
accomplish
its
purpose
a
boot
came
out
on
the
line
in
answer
to
my
call
so
easily
too
that
i
suspected
a
trick
it
was
evidently
a
preconceived
plan
by
which
to
gain
a
moment
more
of
sleep
it
was
a
clear
imposition
on
the
man
at
the
wheel
we
had
also
a
sign
in
this
system
of
telegraphing
that
told
of
on
board
manna
of
the
sea
to
be
gathered
up
for
the
whenever
they
happened
to
alight
or
fall
on
deck
which
was
often
and
as
often
they
found
a
warm
welcome
the
watch
was
never
called
to
make
sail
as
for
myself
i
had
never
to
be
called
having
thoughts
of
the
voyage
and
its
safe
completion
on
my
mind
to
keep
me
always
on
the
alert
i
can
truly
say
that
i
never
on
the
voyage
slept
so
sound
as
to
forget
where
i
was
but
whenever
i
fell
into
a
doze
at
all
it
would
be
to
dream
of
the
boat
and
the
voyage
press
on
press
on
was
the
watchword
while
at
sea
but
in
port
we
enjoyed
ourselves
and
gave
up
care
for
rest
and
pleasure
carrying
a
supply
as
it
were
to
sea
with
us
where
sail
was
again
carried
on
though
a
mast
should
break
it
would
be
no
matter
of
serious
concern
for
we
would
be
at
no
loss
to
mend
and
rig
up
spars
for
this
craft
at
short
notice
most
anywhere
the
third
day
out
from
bahia
was
set
fine
weather
a
few
made
fruitless
attempts
to
rise
from
the
surface
of
the
sea
attracting
but
little
attention
from
the
which
sat
looking
wistfully
across
the
unbroken
deep
with
folded
wings
and
the
doing
her
utmost
to
get
along
through
the
common
quiet
made
but
little
progress
on
her
way
a
dainty
fish
played
in
her
light
wake
till
tempted
by
an
evil
appetite
for
flies
it
landed
in
the
cockpit
upon
a
hook
thence
into
the
pan
where
many
a
one
had
brought
up
before
breakfast
was
cleared
away
at
an
early
hour
then
day
of
good
things
happened
the
meeting
of
the
ships
when
the
silent
sea
alone
for
days
and
nights
we
cheerless
gone
oh
they
who
felt
it
know
how
sweet
some
sunny
morn
a
sail
to
meet
sparkling
at
once
is
every
eye
ship
ahoy
ship
ahoy
our
joyful
cry
while
answering
back
the
sound
we
hear
ship
ahoy
ship
ahoy
what
cheer
what
cheer
then
sails
are
backed
we
nearer
come
kind
words
are
said
of
friends
and
home
and
soon
too
soon
we
part
with
pain
to
sail
silent
seas
again
on
the
clear
horizon
could
be
seen
a
ship
which
proved
to
be
our
staunch
old
friend
the
on
her
way
out
to
brazil
heading
nearly
for
us
our
course
was
at
once
changed
so
as
to
cross
her
bows
she
rose
rapidly
hull
up
showing
her
lines
of
unmistakable
beauty
the
stars
and
stripes
waving
over
all
they
on
board
the
great
ship
soon
descried
our
little
boat
and
gave
sign
by
a
deep
whistle
that
came
rumbling
over
the
sea
telling
us
that
we
were
recognized
a
few
moments
later
and
the
engines
stopped
then
came
the
hearty
hail
do
you
want
assistance
our
answer
no
brought
cheer
on
cheer
from
the
deck
while
the
bowed
and
courtesied
to
her
old
acquaintance
the
superior
ship
captain
baker
meanwhile
not
forgetting
a
sailor
most
highly
prized
luxury
had
ordered
in
the
slings
a
barrel
of
potatoes
new
from
home
then
dump
they
came
in
a
jiffy
into
the
canoe
giving
her
a
settle
in
the
water
of
some
inches
other
fresh
provisions
were
handed
us
also
some
books
and
late
papers
aspinwill
hodge
on
a
tour
of
inspection
in
the
interest
of
the
presbyterian
mission
in
brazil
on
deck
here
with
his
camera
got
an
excellent
photograph
of
the
canoe
one
gentleman
passed
us
a
bottle
of
wine
on
the
label
of
which
was
written
the
name
of
an
old
acquaintance
a
merchant
of
rio
we
pledged
gudgeon
and
all
his
fellow
passengers
in
that
wine
and
had
some
left
long
after
to
the
health
of
the
captain
of
the
ship
and
his
crew
there
was
but
little
time
for
words
so
the
compliments
passed
were
brief
the
ample
plates
in
the
sides
of
the
inspiring
confidence
in
american
thoroughness
and
build
we
had
hardly
time
to
scan
when
her
shrill
whistle
said
and
moving
proudly
on
the
great
ship
was
soon
out
of
sight
while
the
little
boat
filling
away
on
the
starboard
tack
sailed
on
toward
home
perfumed
with
the
interchange
of
a
friendly
greeting
tinged
though
with
a
palpable
lonesomeness
two
days
after
this
pleasant
meeting
the
port
of
pernambuco
was
reached
tumbling
in
before
a
fresh
trade
wind
that
in
the
evening
had
sprung
up
accompanied
with
long
rolling
seas
our
canoe
came
nicely
round
the
point
between
lighted
reef
and
painted
buoy
spray
from
the
breakers
on
the
reef
opportunely
wetting
her
sails
gave
them
a
flat
surface
to
the
wind
as
we
came
close
haul
the
channel
leading
up
the
harbour
was
not
strange
to
us
so
we
sailed
confidently
along
the
lee
of
the
wonderful
wall
made
by
worms
to
which
alone
pernambuco
is
indebted
for
its
excellent
harbour
which
extending
also
along
a
great
stretch
of
the
coast
protects
brazil
from
the
encroachment
of
the
sea
at
we
came
to
in
a
snug
berth
near
the
and
early
next
morning
received
the
official
visit
from
the
polite
port
officers
time
from
bahia
five
days
distance
sailed
miles
pernambuco
the
principal
town
of
a
large
and
wealthy
province
of
the
same
name
is
a
thriving
place
sending
out
valuable
cargoes
principally
of
sugar
and
cotton
i
had
loaded
costly
cargoes
here
times
gone
by
i
met
my
old
merchant
again
this
time
but
could
not
carry
his
goods
on
the
however
fruits
from
his
orchards
and
a
run
among
the
trees
refreshed
my
crew
and
prepared
them
for
the
coming
voyage
to
barbadoes
which
was
made
with
expedition
from
pernambuco
we
experienced
a
strong
current
in
our
favour
with
sometimes
a
confused
cross
sea
that
washed
over
us
considerably
but
the
swift
current
sweeping
along
through
it
all
made
compensation
for
discomforts
of
motion
though
our
ups
and
downs
were
many
along
this
part
of
the
coast
from
pernambuco
to
the
amazon
if
one
day
should
be
fine
three
stormy
ones
would
follow
but
the
gale
was
always
fair
carrying
us
forward
at
a
goodly
rate
along
about
half
way
from
cape
roque
to
the
amazon
the
wind
which
had
been
blowing
hard
for
two
days
from
and
raising
lively
waves
all
about
increased
to
a
gale
that
knocked
up
seas
washing
over
the
little
craft
more
than
ever
the
thing
was
becoming
monotonous
and
tiresome
for
a
change
therefore
i
ran
in
toward
the
land
so
as
to
avoid
the
ugly
cross
sea
farther
out
in
the
current
this
course
was
a
mistaken
one
we
had
not
sailed
far
on
it
when
a
sudden
rise
of
the
canoe
followed
by
an
unusually
long
run
down
on
the
slope
of
a
roller
told
us
of
a
danger
that
we
hardly
dared
to
think
of
then
a
mighty
comber
broke
but
as
providence
willed
broke
short
of
the
canoe
which
under
shortened
sail
was
then
scudding
very
fast
we
were
on
a
shoal
and
the
sea
was
breaking
from
the
bottom
the
second
great
roller
came
on
towering
up
up
up
until
nothing
longer
could
support
the
mountain
of
water
and
it
seemed
only
to
pause
before
its
fall
to
take
aim
and
surely
gather
us
up
in
its
sweeping
fury
i
put
the
helm
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
but
this
and
say
prayers
the
helm
hard
down
brought
the
canoe
round
bows
to
the
danger
while
in
breathless
anxiety
we
prepared
to
meet
the
result
as
best
we
could
before
we
could
say
save
us
or
we
perish
the
sea
broke
over
with
terrific
force
and
passed
on
leaving
us
trembling
in
his
hand
more
palpably
helpless
than
ever
before
other
great
waves
came
madly
on
leaping
toward
destruction
how
they
bellowed
over
the
shoal
i
could
smell
the
slimy
bottom
of
the
sea
when
they
broke
i
could
taste
the
salty
sand
in
this
perilous
situation
buried
sometimes
in
the
foaming
breakers
and
at
times
tossed
like
a
reed
on
the
crest
of
the
waves
we
struggled
with
might
and
main
at
the
helm
and
the
sheets
easing
her
up
or
forcing
her
ahead
with
care
gaining
little
by
little
toward
deep
water
till
at
last
she
came
out
of
the
danger
shook
her
feathers
like
a
and
rode
on
waves
less
perilous
then
we
had
time
and
courage
to
look
back
but
not
till
then
and
what
a
sight
we
beheld
the
horizon
was
illumined
with
phosphorescent
light
from
the
breakers
just
passed
through
the
rainstorm
which
had
obscured
the
coast
was
so
cleared
away
now
that
we
could
see
the
whole
field
of
danger
behind
us
one
spot
in
particular
the
place
where
the
breakers
dashed
over
a
rock
which
appeared
awash
in
the
glare
flashed
up
a
shaft
of
light
that
reached
to
the
heavens
this
was
the
greatest
danger
we
had
yet
encountered
the
elasticity
of
our
canoe
not
its
bulk
saved
it
from
destruction
her
light
springy
timbers
and
buoyant
bamboo
guards
brought
her
upright
again
and
again
through
the
fierce
breakers
we
were
astonished
at
the
feats
of
wonder
of
our
brave
little
craft
fatigued
and
worn
with
anxiety
when
clear
of
the
shoal
we
hauled
to
under
close
reefs
heading
off
shore
and
all
hands
lay
down
to
rest
till
daylight
then
squaring
away
again
we
set
what
sail
the
canoe
could
carry
scudding
before
it
for
the
wind
was
still
in
our
favour
though
blowing
very
hard
nevertheless
the
weather
seemed
fine
and
pleasant
at
this
stage
of
our
own
pleased
feelings
any
weather
that
one
craft
can
live
in
after
escaping
a
lee
shore
is
pleasant
weather
though
some
may
be
pleasanter
than
other
what
we
most
wished
for
after
this
thrilling
experience
was
sea
room
fair
wind
and
plenty
of
it
that
these
without
stint
would
suit
us
best
was
agreed
on
all
hands
accordingly
then
i
shaped
the
course
seaward
clearing
well
all
the
dangers
of
the
land
the
fierce
tropical
storm
of
the
last
few
days
turned
gradually
into
mild
and
our
cedar
canoe
skipped
nimbly
once
more
over
tranquil
seas
our
own
agitation
too
had
gone
down
and
we
sailed
on
unruffled
by
care
gentle
winds
carried
us
on
over
kindly
waves
and
we
were
fain
to
count
fair
days
ahead
leaving
all
thoughts
of
stormy
ones
behind
in
this
hopeful
mood
we
sailed
for
many
days
our
spirits
never
lowering
but
often
rising
higher
out
of
the
miserable
condition
which
we
had
fallen
into
through
misfortunes
on
the
foreign
shore
when
a
star
came
out
it
came
as
a
friend
and
one
that
had
been
seen
by
friends
of
old
when
all
the
stars
shone
out
the
hour
at
sea
was
cheerful
bright
and
joyous
welby
saw
or
had
in
the
a
day
like
many
that
we
experienced
in
the
soft
clear
trades
on
this
voyage
when
writing
the
pretty
lines
the
twilight
hours
like
birds
flew
by
as
lightly
and
as
free
ten
thousand
stars
were
in
the
sky
ten
thousand
on
the
sea
for
every
rippling
dancing
wave
that
leaped
upon
the
air
had
caught
a
star
in
its
embrace
and
held
it
trembling
there
the
days
pass
and
our
ship
flies
fast
upon
her
way
for
several
days
while
sailing
near
the
line
we
saw
the
constellations
of
both
hemispheres
but
heading
north
we
left
those
of
the
south
at
last
with
the
southern
cross
most
beautiful
in
all
the
heavens
to
watch
over
a
friend
leaving
these
familiar
southern
stars
and
sailing
toward
constellations
in
the
north
we
hoist
all
sail
to
the
cheery
breeze
which
carries
us
on
in
this
pleasant
state
of
sailing
with
our
friends
all
about
us
we
stood
on
and
on
never
doubting
once
our
pilot
or
our
ship
a
phantom
of
the
stately
appeared
one
night
sweeping
by
with
crowning
skysails
set
that
fairly
brushed
the
stars
no
apparition
could
have
affected
us
more
than
the
sight
of
this
floating
beauty
so
like
the
gliding
swiftly
and
quietly
by
from
her
mission
to
some
foreign
land
she
too
was
homeward
bound
this
incident
of
the
ghost
as
it
appeared
to
us
passing
at
midnight
on
the
sea
left
a
pang
of
lonesomeness
for
a
while
but
a
carrier
dove
came
next
day
and
perched
upon
the
mast
as
if
to
tell
that
we
had
yet
a
friend
welcome
harbinger
of
good
you
bring
us
thoughts
of
angels
the
lovely
visitor
remained
with
us
two
days
off
and
on
but
left
for
good
on
the
third
when
we
reached
away
from
avis
island
to
which
maybe
it
was
bound
coming
as
it
did
from
the
east
and
flying
west
toward
the
island
when
it
left
bore
out
the
idea
of
the
lay
of
sweet
singer
kingsley
last
buccaneer
if
i
might
but
be
a
sea
dove
i
fly
across
the
main
to
the
pleasant
isle
of
avis
to
look
at
it
once
again
the
old
buccaneer
it
may
have
been
but
we
regarded
it
as
the
little
bird
which
most
likely
it
was
that
sits
up
aloft
to
look
out
for
poor
jack
a
moth
blown
to
our
boat
on
the
ocean
found
shelter
and
a
welcome
there
the
dove
we
secretly
worshipped
with
utmost
confidence
in
our
little
craft
inspired
by
many
thrilling
events
we
now
carried
sail
blow
high
blow
low
till
at
times
she
reeled
along
with
a
bone
in
her
mouth
quite
to
the
mind
of
her
mariners
thinking
one
day
that
she
might
carry
more
sail
on
the
mast
already
bending
hopefully
forward
and
acting
upon
the
liberal
thought
of
sail
we
made
a
wide
mistake
for
the
mainmast
went
by
the
board
under
the
extra
press
and
the
foremast
tripped
over
the
bows
then
spars
booms
and
sails
swung
alongside
like
the
broken
wings
of
a
bird
but
were
grappled
however
and
brought
aboard
without
much
loss
of
time
the
broken
mast
was
then
secured
and
strengthened
by
fishes
or
splints
after
the
manner
in
which
doctors
fish
a
broken
limb
both
of
the
masts
were
very
soon
refitted
and
again
made
to
carry
sail
all
they
could
stand
and
we
were
again
bowling
along
as
before
we
made
that
day
a
hundred
and
miles
one
of
our
best
days
work
i
protest
here
that
my
wife
should
not
have
cried
more
sail
more
sail
when
as
it
has
been
seen
the
canoe
had
on
all
the
sail
that
she
could
carry
nothing
further
happened
to
change
the
usual
daily
events
until
we
reached
barbadoes
on
the
wing
striking
our
sails
at
night
often
fell
on
deck
affording
us
many
a
toothsome
fry
this
happened
daily
while
sailing
throughout
the
regions
to
be
hit
by
one
of
these
fish
on
the
wing
which
sometimes
occurs
is
no
light
matter
especially
if
the
blow
be
on
the
face
as
it
may
cause
a
bad
bruise
or
even
a
black
eye
the
head
of
the
being
rather
hard
makes
it
in
fact
a
night
slugger
to
be
dreaded
they
never
come
aboard
in
the
daylight
the
swift
darting
too
is
a
danger
to
be
avoided
in
the
tropics
at
night
they
are
met
with
mostly
in
the
pacific
ocean
therefore
south
sea
islanders
are
loath
to
voyage
during
the
season
as
to
the
flight
of
these
fishes
i
would
estimate
that
of
the
as
not
exceeding
fifteen
feet
in
height
or
five
hundred
yards
of
distance
often
not
half
so
much
darting
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
have
fortunately
for
sailors
not
the
power
or
do
not
rise
much
above
the
level
of
the
waves
and
can
not
dart
further
say
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
according
to
the
day
for
jumping
of
the
many
swift
fish
in
the
sea
the
dolphin
perhaps
is
the
most
marvellous
its
beauty
too
is
indeed
remarkable
a
few
of
these
fleet
racers
were
captured
on
the
voyage
but
were
found
tough
and
rank
notwithstanding
some
eulogy
on
them
by
other
epicures
we
threw
the
mess
away
those
hooked
by
my
crew
were
perhaps
the
tyrrhena
pirates
turned
into
dolphins
in
the
days
of
yore
on
the
day
from
pernambuco
early
in
the
morning
we
made
barbadoes
away
in
the
west
first
the
blue
fertile
hills
then
green
fields
came
into
view
studded
with
many
white
buildings
between
sentries
of
giant
as
old
nearly
as
the
hills
barbadoes
is
the
most
pleasant
island
in
the
antilles
to
sail
round
its
green
fringe
of
coral
sea
is
simply
charming
we
stood
in
to
the
coast
well
to
windward
sailing
close
in
with
the
breakers
so
as
to
take
in
a
view
of
the
whole
delightful
panorama
as
we
sailed
along
by
noon
we
rounded
the
south
point
of
the
island
and
shot
into
carlysle
bay
completing
the
run
from
pernambuco
exactly
in
nineteen
days
this
was
considerably
more
than
an
hundred
miles
a
day
the
true
distance
being
augmented
by
the
circuitous
route
we
adopted
made
it
miles
footnotes
we
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
this
gentleman
again
on
the
voyage
at
barbadoes
again
at
new
london
and
finally
with
delight
we
heard
him
lecture
on
his
travels
at
newport
and
saw
there
produced
on
the
wall
the
very
picture
of
the
taken
by
the
doctor
on
the
great
ocean
there
a
sweet
little
cherub
that
sits
up
aloft
to
look
out
for
a
berth

at
barbadoes
mayaguez
crossing
the
bahama
banks
the
gulf
stream
arrival
on
the
coast
of
south
carolina
many
old
friends
and
acquaintances
came
down
to
see
us
upon
our
arrival
at
barbadoes
all
curious
to
inspect
the
strange
craft
while
there
our
old
friend
the
that
we
left
at
bahia
came
in
to
refit
having
broken
a
mast
trying
to
beat
us
so
garfield
would
have
it
for
all
that
we
had
beaten
her
by
four
days
who
then
shall
say
that
we
anchored
nights
or
spent
much
time
hugging
the
shore
the
was
also
at
barbadoes
in
charge
of
an
old
friend
accompanied
by
a
pleasant
helpmeet
and
companion
who
had
shared
the
perils
of
shipwreck
with
her
husband
the
year
before
in
a
hurricane
among
the
islands
meeting
so
many
of
this
class
of
old
friends
of
vast
and
varied
experiences
gave
contentment
to
our
visit
and
we
concluded
to
remain
over
at
this
port
till
the
hurricane
season
should
pass
our
old
friend
the
too
came
in
remaining
but
a
few
hours
however
she
hurried
away
with
her
mails
homeward
bound
the
pleasant
days
at
barbadoes
with
its
enchantment
flew
lightly
by
and
on
the
of
october
we
sailed
giving
the
hurricane
season
the
benefit
of
eight
days
the
season
is
considered
over
on
the
of
that
month
passing
thence
through
the
antilles
into
the
caribbean
sea
a
new
period
of
our
voyage
was
begun
fair
breezes
filled
the
sails
of
the
as
we
glided
along
over
tranquil
seas
scanning
eagerly
the
islands
as
they
came
into
view
dwelling
on
each
in
our
thoughts
as
hallowed
ground
of
the
illustrious
discoverers
the
same
now
as
seen
by
them
the
birds
too
of
rare
plumage
were
there
flying
from
island
to
island
the
same
as
seen
by
the
discoverers
and
the
sea
with
fishes
teemed
of
every
gorgeous
hue
lending
enchantment
to
the
picture
not
less
beautiful
than
the
splendour
on
the
land
and
in
the
air
to
thrill
the
voyager
now
the
same
as
then
we
ourselves
had
only
to
look
to
see
them
whether
it
was
birds
with
fins
or
fishes
with
wings
or
neither
of
these
that
the
old
voyagers
saw
they
discovered
yet
enough
to
make
them
wonder
and
rejoice
mountains
of
sugar
and
rivers
of
rum
and
was
what
i
saw
mother
said
the
son
on
his
return
from
a
voyage
to
these
islands
john
said
the
enraptured
mother
you
must
be
mistaken
about
the
fish
now
do
lie
to
me
john
mountains
of
sugar
no
doubt
you
saw
and
even
rivers
of
rum
my
boy
but
could
never
be
and
yet
the
were
there
among
the
islands
of
great
interest
which
came
in
view
stretching
along
the
caribbean
sea
was
that
of
santa
cruz
the
island
famous
for
its
brave
resolute
women
of
days
gone
by
who
while
their
husbands
were
away
successfully
defended
home
and
happiness
against
christian
invaders
and
for
that
reason
were
called
fierce
savages
i
would
fain
have
brought
away
some
of
the
earth
of
the
island
in
memory
of
those
brave
women
small
as
our
ship
was
we
could
have
afforded
room
in
it
for
a
memento
thus
consecrated
but
the
trades
hauling
somewhat
to
the
northward
so
headed
us
off
that
we
had
to
forgo
the
pleasure
of
landing
on
its
shores
pushing
forward
thence
we
reached
porto
rico
the
nearest
land
in
our
course
from
the
island
of
brave
women
standing
well
in
with
the
southeast
capes
sailing
thence
along
the
whole
extent
of
the
south
coast
in
waters
as
smooth
as
any
mill
pond
and
past
island
scenery
worth
the
perils
of
ten
voyages
to
see
we
landed
on
the
of
october
at
mayaguez
in
the
west
of
the
island
and
there
shook
the
kinks
out
of
our
bones
by
pleasant
walks
in
tropic
shades
time
five
days
from
barbadoes
distance
miles
this
was
to
be
our
last
run
among
the
trees
in
the
west
indies
and
we
made
the
most
of
it
such
a
port
for
mariners
i
never
see
again
the
port
officials
kind
and
polite
extended
all
becoming
courtesies
to
the
quaint
the
american
consul
christie
danish
consul
falby
and
the
good
french
consul
vied
in
making
our
visit
a
pleasant
one
photographers
at
mayaguez
desiring
a
picture
of
the
canoe
with
the
crew
on
deck
at
a
time
when
we
felt
inclined
to
rest
in
the
shade
on
shore
put
a
negro
on
board
to
take
the
place
of
captain
the
photographs
taken
then
found
their
way
to
paris
and
madrid
journals
where
along
with
some
flattering
accounts
they
were
published
upon
which
it
was
remarked
that
the
captain
was
a
fellow
but
awfully
tanned
the
moke
was
rigged
all
ataunto
for
the
occasion
and
made
a
picture
indicative
of
great
physical
strength
one
not
to
be
ashamed
of
but
he
would
have
looked
more
like
me
i
must
say
if
they
had
turned
him
back
to
we
enjoyed
long
carriage
drives
over
rich
estates
at
mayaguez
we
saw
with
pain
however
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
soldier
hung
over
all
pervading
the
whole
air
like
a
pestilence
musketed
and
sabred
and
uniformed
in
their
suits
hated
by
the
residents
and
despised
by
themselves
they
doggedly
marched
and
wheeled
knowing
that
they
are
loathsome
in
the
island
and
that
their
days
in
the
new
world
are
numbered
the
sons
of
the
colonies
are
too
civil
and
christianlike
to
be
ruled
always
by
sword
and
gun
on
the
of
october
after
three
days
rest
we
took
in
as
usual
before
sailing
from
ports
sufficient
fresh
supplies
to
carry
us
to
the
port
steered
for
next
then
set
sail
from
pleasant
mayaguez
and
bore
away
for
the
old
bahama
channel
passing
east
of
hayti
thence
along
the
north
coast
to
the
west
extremity
of
the
island
from
which
we
took
departure
for
the
of
cuba
and
followed
that
coast
as
far
as
cardinas
where
we
took
a
final
departure
from
the
islands
regretting
that
we
could
not
sail
around
them
all
the
region
on
the
north
side
of
cuba
is
often
visited
by
gales
of
great
violence
making
this
the
lee
shore
a
weather
eye
was
therefore
kept
lifting
especially
in
the
direction
of
their
source
which
is
from
north
to
however
storms
prevailed
from
other
quarters
mostly
from
the
east
bringing
heavy
squalls
of
wind
rain
and
thunder
every
afternoon
such
as
once
heard
will
never
be
forgotten
peal
on
peal
of
nature
artillery
for
a
few
hours
accompanied
by
vivid
lightning
was
on
the
cards
for
each
day
then
all
would
be
serene
again
the
nights
following
these
severe
storms
were
always
bright
and
pleasant
and
the
heavens
would
be
studded
with
constellations
of
familiar
guiding
stars
my
crew
had
now
no
wish
to
bear
up
for
port
short
of
one
on
our
own
coast
but
impatient
to
see
the
north
star
appear
higher
in
the
heavens
strung
every
nerve
and
trimmed
every
sail
to
hasten
on
nassau
the
place
to
which
letters
had
been
directed
to
us
we
forbore
to
visit
this
departure
from
a
programme
which
was
made
at
the
beginning
was
the
only
change
that
we
made
in
the
charter
party
throughout
the
voyage
there
was
no
haphazard
sailing
on
this
voyage
daily
observations
for
determining
latitude
and
longitude
were
invariably
made
unless
the
sun
was
obscured
the
result
of
these
astronomical
observations
were
more
reliable
than
one
might
suppose
from
their
being
taken
on
a
tittlish
canoe
after
a
few
practising
a
very
fair
contact
could
be
made
when
the
canoe
rose
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
where
manifestly
would
be
found
the
best
result
the
observer
station
was
simply
on
the
top
of
the
cabin
where
astride
like
riding
horseback
victor
and
i
took
the
sights
and
indeed
became
expert
snap
observers
before
the
voyage
ended
one
night
in
the
bahama
channel
while
booming
along
toward
the
banks
to
the
of
us
before
stiff
trades
i
was
called
in
the
first
watch
by
victor
to
come
up
quickly
for
signs
of
the
dread
norther
were
in
the
sky
our
trusty
barometer
had
been
low
but
was
now
on
the
cheerful
side
of
change
this
phenomenon
disturbed
me
somewhat
till
the
discovery
was
made
as
we
came
nearer
that
it
was
but
the
reflection
of
the
white
banks
on
the
sky
that
we
saw
and
no
cause
at
all
for
alarm
soon
after
this
phenomenon
the
faint
glimmer
of
lobos
light
was
descried
flickering
on
the
horizon
two
points
on
the
weather
bow
i
changed
the
course
three
points
to
windward
having
determined
to
touch
at
the
small
cay
where
the
lighthouse
stands
one
point
being
allowed
for
leeway
which
i
found
was
not
too
much
three
hours
later
we
fetched
in
under
the
lee
of
the
reef
or
cay
as
it
is
commonly
called
and
came
to
in
one
and
a
half
fathoms
of
water
in
good
shelter
we
beheld
then
overhead
in
wonderful
beauty
what
had
awed
us
from
the
distance
in
the
early
night
a
chart
of
the
illuminating
banks
marked
visibly
on
the
heavens
we
furled
sails
and
setting
a
light
in
the
rigging
turned
in
for
it
lacked
three
hours
yet
of
daylight
and
what
an
interesting
experience
ours
had
been
in
the
one
short
night
by
the
break
of
day
my
crew
were
again
astir
preparing
to
land
and
fill
water
at
a
good
landing
which
we
now
perceived
farther
around
the
point
to
leeward
where
the
surf
was
moderate
on
the
cay
is
stored
some
hundred
thousand
gallons
of
rain
water
in
cisterns
at
the
base
of
the
iron
tower
which
carries
the
light
one
that
we
saw
from
the
canoe
at
a
distance
of
fourteen
miles
the
keeper
of
the
light
a
hardy
native
of
nassau
when
he
discovered
the
new
arrival
at
his
island
hoisted
the
british
board
of
trade
flag
on
a
pole
in
the
centre
of
this
his
little
world
then
he
came
forward
to
speak
us
thinking
at
first
he
said
that
we
were
shipwrecked
sailors
which
indeed
we
were
but
not
in
distress
as
he
had
supposed
when
hoisting
the
flag
which
signified
assistance
for
distressed
seamen
on
learning
our
story
however
he
regarded
us
with
grave
suspicions
and
refused
water
to
victor
who
had
already
landed
with
buckets
telling
him
that
the
captain
would
have
to
bring
his
papers
ashore
and
report
the
mate
report
would
not
be
taken
thus
in
a
moment
was
transformed
the
friend
in
need
to
of
an
this
amused
me
greatly
and
i
sent
back
word
to
my
veritable
sancho
panza
that
in
my
many
voyages
to
islands
my
mate
had
attended
to
the
customs
reports
at
which
his
excellency
chafed
considerably
giving
the
gunnels
of
his
trousers
a
fitful
tug
up
now
and
then
as
he
paced
the
beach
waiting
my
compliance
with
the
rules
of
the
island
the
governor
i
perceived
was
suspicious
of
smugglers
and
wreckers
apparently
understanding
their
ways
if
indeed
even
he
were
not
a
reformed
pirate
himself
however
to
humour
the
punctiliousness
of
his
excellency
now
that
he
was
governor
of
an
island
i
placed
my
papers
in
my
hat
and
leaping
into
the
surf
waded
ashore
where
i
was
received
as
by
a
monarch
the
document
i
presented
was
the
original
the
one
with
the
big
seal
on
it
written
in
portuguese
had
it
been
in
choctàw
the
governor
would
have
read
it
with
the
same
facility
that
he
did
this
which
he
stared
at
knowingly
and
said
all
right
take
all
the
water
you
want
it
is
free
i
lodged
a
careful
report
of
the
voyage
with
the
governor
and
explained
to
his
excellency
the
whereabouts
of
the
island
of
rio
as
his
grace
persistently
called
rio
de
janeiro
whence
dated
my
papers
conversing
on
the
subject
of
islands
which
was
all
the
world
to
him
the
governor
viewed
with
suspicion
the
absence
of
a
word
in
my
documents
referring
even
to
an
islet
this
in
his
mind
was
a
reprehensible
omission
for
surely
new
york
to
which
the
papers
referred
was
built
on
an
island
upon
this
i
offered
to
swear
to
the
truth
of
my
clearance
as
far
as
known
to
me
after
the
manner
of
cheap
swearing
with
which
shipmasters
in
some
parts
of
the
world
are
made
familiar
not
on
the
island
quickly
exclaimed
the
governor
thou
shalt
not
disglorify
god
name
is
written
in
the
bible
i
assured
the
governor
of
my
appreciation
of
his
pious
sentiment
of
not
a
laudable
plan
that
even
the
chinese
adopt
as
a
policy
and
one
that
i
would
speak
of
on
my
return
home
to
the
end
that
we
all
emulate
the
laws
of
the
island
whereupon
the
governor
greatly
pleased
urged
me
to
take
some
more
water
minding
me
again
that
it
was
free
in
a
very
few
minutes
i
got
all
the
water
i
wished
for
also
some
aurora
shells
from
the
governor
lady
who
had
arisen
with
the
sun
to
grace
the
day
and
of
all
things
most
appropriate
held
in
her
generous
lap
beautiful
aurora
shells
for
which
to
spoil
the
poem
i
bartered
and
rusty
gnarly
yams
the
lady
was
on
a
visit
only
to
her
lord
and
master
the
monarch
of
all
he
surveyed
beside
this
was
their
three
children
also
on
a
visit
from
nassau
and
two
assistant
keepers
of
the
light
which
made
up
the
total
of
this
little
world
in
the
ocean
it
was
the
smallest
kingdom
i
had
ever
visited
peopled
by
happy
human
beings
and
the
most
isolated
by
far
the
few
blades
of
grass
which
had
struggled
into
existence
not
enough
to
support
a
goat
was
all
there
was
to
look
at
on
the
island
except
the
lighthouse
and
the
sand
and
themselves
some
small
buildings
and
a
flagstaff
had
once
adorned
the
place
but
together
with
a
coop
of
chickens
the
only
stock
of
the
islanders
except
a
dog
had
been
swept
away
by
a
hurricane
which
had
passed
over
the
island
a
short
time
before
the
water
for
which
we
had
called
being
now
in
the
canoe
and
my
people
on
board
waiting
for
me
i
bade
the
worthy
governor
and
saluting
his
charming
island
queen
in
a
manner
hastened
back
to
my
own
little
world
and
bore
away
once
more
for
the
north
sailing
thence
over
the
great
bahama
banks
in
a
crystal
sea
we
observed
on
the
white
marl
bottom
many
curious
living
things
among
them
the
conch
in
its
house
of
exquisite
tints
and
polished
surface
the
with
radiated
dome
of
curious
construction
and
many
more
denizens
of
the
place
the
names
of
which
i
could
not
tell
resting
on
the
soft
white
bed
under
the
sea
they
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
they
see
the
wonders
of
the
lord
i
am
reminded
by
a
friend
who
writes
me
on
receipt
of
some
of
these
curious
things
which
i
secured
on
the
voyage
adding
for
all
these
curious
and
beautiful
things
are
his
handiwork
who
can
look
at
such
things
without
the
heart
being
lifted
up
in
adoration
for
words
like
these
what
sailor
is
there
who
would
not
search
the
caves
of
the
ocean
words
too
from
a
lady
two
days
of
brisk
sailing
over
the
white
bahama
banks
brought
us
to
bimini
thence
a
mere
push
would
send
us
to
the
coast
of
our
own
native
america
the
wind
in
the
meantime
hauling
from
regular
trade
to
the
as
we
came
up
to
bimini
promising
a
smooth
passage
across
we
launched
out
at
once
on
the
great
gulf
stream
and
were
swept
along
by
its
restless
motion
making
on
the
first
day
before
the
wind
and
current
two
hundred
and
twenty
miles
this
was
great
getting
along
for
a
small
canoe
going
at
the
same
high
rate
of
speed
on
the
second
night
in
the
stream
the
canoe
struck
a
spar
and
went
over
it
with
a
bound
her
keel
was
shattered
by
the
shock
but
finally
shaking
the
crippled
timber
clear
of
herself
she
came
on
quite
well
without
it
no
other
damage
was
done
to
our
craft
although
at
times
her
very
ribs
were
threatened
before
clearing
this
lively
ocean
river
in
the
middle
of
the
current
where
the
seas
were
yet
mountainous
but
regular
we
went
along
with
a
wide
swinging
motion
and
fared
well
enough
but
on
nearing
the
edge
of
the
stream
a
confused
sea
was
met
with
standing
all
on
end
in
every
which
way
beyond
a
sailor
comprehension
the
motion
of
the
was
then
far
from
poetical
or
pleasant
the
wind
in
the
meantime
had
chopped
round
to
the
dead
ahead
being
thus
against
the
current
a
higher
and
more
confused
sea
than
ever
was
heaped
up
giving
us
some
uneasiness
we
had
indeed
several
unwelcome
visitors
come
tumbling
aboard
of
our
craft
one
of
which
furiously
crashing
down
on
her
made
all
of
her
timbers
bend
and
creak
however
i
could
partially
remedy
this
danger
by
changing
the
course
seas
like
that
ca
break
this
boat
said
our
young
boatswain
built
strong
it
was
well
to
find
among
the
crew
this
feeling
of
assurance
in
the
gallant
little
vessel
i
too
was
confident
in
her
seaworthiness
nevertheless
i
shortened
sail
and
brought
her
to
the
wind
watching
the
lulls
and
easing
her
over
the
combers
as
well
as
i
could
but
wrathful
neptune
was
not
to
let
us
so
easily
off
for
the
next
moment
a
sea
swept
clean
over
the
helmsman
wetting
him
through
to
the
skin
and
most
unkind
cut
of
all
it
put
out
our
fire
and
capsized
the
hash
and
stove
into
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
this
left
us
with
but
a
for
breakfast
matters
mended
however
as
the
day
advanced
and
for
supper
we
had
a
grand
and
glorious
feast
early
in
the
afternoon
we
made
the
land
and
got
into
smooth
water
this
of
itself
was
a
feast
to
our
minds
the
land
we
now
saw
lying
before
us
was
hills
of
america
which
we
had
sailed
many
thousands
of
miles
to
see
drawing
in
with
the
coast
we
made
out
first
the
broad
rich
forests
then
open
fields
and
villages
with
many
signs
of
comfort
on
every
hand
we
found
it
was
the
land
about
bull
bay
on
the
coast
of
south
carolina
and
night
coming
on
we
could
plainly
see
cape
roman
light
to
the
north
of
us
the
wind
falling
light
as
we
drew
in
with
the
coast
and
finding
a
current
against
us
we
anchored
about
two
miles
from
the
shore
in
four
fathoms
of
water
it
was
now
october
thirteen
days
from
mayaguez
days
from
barbadoes
etc
the
following
was
the
actual
time
at
sea
and
distances
in
nautical

from

computing
all
the

of

would
considerably
augment
the
sum
to
say
therefore
that
the
averaged
a
hundred
and
three
miles
a
day
for
days
would
be
considerably
inside
the
truth
this
was
the
voyage
made
in
the
boat
which
cost
less
than
a
hundred
dollars
outside
of
our
own
labour
of
building
journals
the
world
over
have
spoken
not
unkindly
of
the
feat
encomiums
in
seven
languages
reached
us
through
the
newspapers
while
we
lay
moored
in
washington
should
the
same
good
fortune
that
followed
the
attend
this
little
literary
craft
when
finished
it
would
go
safe
into
many
lands
without
looking
however
to
this
mark
of
good
fortune
the
journal
of
the
voyage
has
been
as
carefully
constructed
as
was
the
and
i
trust
as
conscientiously
by
a
hand
alas
that
has
grasped
the
sextant
more
often
than
the
plane
or
pen
and
for
the
love
of
doing
this
apology
might
have
been
more
appropriately
made
in
the
beginning
of
the
journal
maybe
but
it
comes
to
me
now
and
like
many
other
things
done
right
or
wrong
but
done
on
the
impulse
of
the

put

ocean
currents

at
the

quarantined
south

wilmington
inland

to
beaufort
norfolk
and
washington
voyage
ended
no
one
will
be
more
surprised
at
the
complete
success
of
the
voyage
and
the
speedy
progress
made
than
were
we
ourselves
who
made
it
a
factor
of
the
voyage
one
that
helped
us
forward
greatly
and
which
is
worthy
of
special
mention
was
the
ocean
current
spoken
of
as
we
came
along
in
its
friendly
sway
many
are
the
theories
among
philosophists
respecting
these
currents
but
in
practical
sailing
where
the
subject
is
met
with
in
its
tangible
form
one
cause
only
is
recognized
namely
the
action
of
the
wind
on
the
surface
of
the
water
pushing
the
waves
along
out
on
the
broad
ocean
the
effect
at
first
is
hardly
perceptible
but
the
constant
trades
sending
countless
millions
of
waves
in
one
direction
cause
at
last
a
mighty
moving
power
which
the
mariner
meets
sometimes
as
an
enemy
to
retard
and
delay
sometimes
as
a
friend
as
in
our
case
to
help
him
on
his
way
these
are
views
from
a
practical
experience
with
no
theory
to
prove
by
daylight
on
the
we
weighed
anchor
and
set
sail
again
for
the
north
the
wind
and
current
were
still
adverse
but
we
kept
near
the
land
making
short
boards
off
and
on
through
the
day
where
the
current
had
least
effect
and
when
night
came
on
again
we
closed
in
once
more
with
cape
roman
light
next
day
we
worked
up
under
the
lee
of
the
roman
shoals
and
made
harbour
in
south
santee
a
small
river
to
the
north
of
cape
roman
within
range
of
the
light
there
to
rest
until
the
wind
should
change
it
being
still
ahead
next
morning
since
the
wind
had
not
changed
we
weighed
anchor
and
stood
farther
into
the
river
looking
for
inhabitants
that
we
might
listen
to
voices
other
than
our
own
our
search
was
soon
rewarded
for
coming
around
a
point
of
woodland
a
farmhouse
stood
before
us
on
the
river
side
we
came
alongside
the
bank
and
jumped
ashore
but
hardly
had
we
landed
when
as
out
of
the
earth
a
thousand
dogs
so
it
seemed
sprung
up
threatening
to
devour
us
all
however
a
comely
woman
came
out
of
the
house
and
it
was
explained
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
especially
to
a
persistent
cur
by
a
vigorous
whack
on
the
head
with
a
cudgel
that
our
visit
was
a
friendly
one
then
all
was
again
peaceful
and
quiet
the
good
man
was
in
the
field
close
by
but
soon
came
home
accompanied
by
his
two
stalwart
sons
each
toting
a
sack
of
corn
we
found
the
andersons
this
was
the
family
name
isolated
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
as
primitive
as
heart
could
wish
the
charming
simplicity
of
these
good
people
captivated
my
crew
we
met
others
along
the
coast
innocent
of
greed
but
of
all
unselfish
men
anderson
the
elder
was
surely
the
prince
purchasing
some
truck
from
this
good
man
we
found
that
change
could
not
be
made
for
the
dollar
which
i
tendered
in
payment
but
i
protested
that
i
was
more
than
content
to
let
the
few
odd
cents
go
having
received
more
garden
stuff
than
i
had
ever
seen
offered
for
a
dollar
in
any
part
of
the
world
and
indeed
i
was
satisfied
the
farmer
however
nothing
content
offered
me
a
coon
skin
or
two
but
these
i
did
want
and
there
being
no
other
small
change
about
the
farm
the
matter
was
dropped
i
thought
for
good
and
i
had
quite
forgotten
it
when
later
in
the
evening
i
was
electrified
by
his
offering
to
carry
a
letter
for
us
which
we
wished
posted
some
seven
miles
away
and
call
it
square
against
the
twenty
cents
of
the
morning
transaction
the
letter
went
and
in
due
course
of
time
we
got
an
answer
i
do
not
say
that
we
stuck
strictly
to
the
transaction
but
i
fear
that
not
enough
was
paid
to
anderson
however
all
were
at
last
satisfied
and
warming
into
conversation
a
log
fire
was
improvised
and
social
chat
went
round
these
good
people
could
hardly
understand
how
it
was
as
i
explained
that
the
brazilians
had
freed
the
slaves
and
had
no
war
anderson
often
exclaiming
well
well
i
freed
the
niggers
and
had
no
wah
mister
said
he
turning
to
me
after
a
long
pause
mister
d
know
the
south
were
foolish
they
had
a
wah
and
they
had
to
free
the
niggers
too
oh
yes
mister
i
was
thar
over
thar
beyond
them
oaks
was
my
house
yes
mister
i
fought
too
and
fought
hard
but
it
war
no
use
like
many
a
hard
fighter
anderson
too
was
a
pious
man
living
in
a
state
of
resignation
to
be
envied
his
years
of
experience
on
the
new
island
farm
had
been
hard
and
trying
in
the
extreme
my
own
misfortunes
passed
into
shade
as
the
harder
luck
of
the
andersons
came
before
my
mind
and
the
resolution
which
i
had
made
to
buy
a
farm
was
now
shaken
and
finally
dissolved
into
doubts
of
the
wisdom
of
such
a
course
on
this
farm
they
had
first
started
in
to
raise
pork
but
found
that
it
did
pay
for
the
pigs
got
wild
and
had
to
be
gathered
with
the
dogs
and
by
the
time
they
were
gathered
and
then
toted
salt
would
hardly
cure
them
and
they
most
generally
tainted
the
enterprise
was
therefore
abandoned
for
that
of
tilling
the
soil
and
a
crop
was
put
in
but
the
few
pigs
which
the
dogs
had
not
gathered
came
in
at
night
and
rooted
out
all
the
taters
it
then
appeared
that
a
fence
should
be
built
accordingly
said
he
the
boys
and
i
made
one
which
kept
out
the
stock
but
sir
the
rats
could
get
in
they
took
every
tater
out
of
the
ground
from
all
that
i
put
in
and
my
principal
work
was
thar
i
did
see
a
sprout
how
it
happened
that
the
rats
had
left
the
crop
the
year
before
for
their
relations
the
pigs
was
what
seemed
most
to
bother
the
farmer
mind
nevertheless
there
was
corn
in
egypt
yet
and
at
the
family
circle
about
the
board
that
night
a
smile
of
hope
played
on
the
good
farmer
face
as
in
deep
sincerity
he
asked
that
for
what
they
had
they
might
be
made
truly
thankful
we
learned
a
lesson
of
patience
from
this
family
and
were
glad
that
the
wind
had
carried
us
to
their
shore
said
the
farmer
and
you
came
all
the
way
from
brazil
in
that
boat
wife
she
wo
go
to
georgetown
in
the
batto
that
i
built
because
it
rares
too
much
and
they
freed
the
niggers
and
had
no
wah
well
well
i
better
folks
we
may
never
see
than
the
farmers
of
south
santee
bidding
them
next
morning
at
early
dawn
we
sailed
before
a
light
land
wind
which
however
soon
petered
out
the
then
coming
along
took
us
in
tow
for
georgetown
where
she
was
bound
we
had
not
the
pleasure
however
of
visiting
the
beloved
old
city
for
having
some
half
dozen
on
board
the
remainder
of
small
stores
of
the
voyage
a
vigilant
officer
stopped
us
at
the
quarantine
ground
fruit
not
being
admitted
into
south
carolina
until
after
the
first
of
november
and
although
it
was
now
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
first
we
had
to
ride
quarantine
that
night
with
a
promise
however
of
next
morning
but
there
was
no
steamer
going
up
the
river
the
next
day
the
coming
down
though
supplied
us
with
some
small
provisions
such
as
were
not
procurable
at
the
santee
farm
then
putting
to
sea
we
beat
along
slowly
against
wind
and
current
we
began
now
to
experience
as
might
be
expected
autumn
gales
of
considerable
violence
the
heaviest
of
which
overtaking
us
at
shoal
drove
us
back
to
leeward
of
cape
fear
for
shelter
south
port
and
wilmington
being
then
so
near
we
determined
to
visit
both
places
two
weeks
at
these
ports
refreshed
the
crew
and
made
all
hands
willing
for
sea
again
sailing
thence
through
inlet
we
cut
off
cape
fear
and
the
shoals
being
of
mind
to
make
for
the
inlets
along
the
carolina
coast
and
to
get
into
the
inland
waters
as
soon
as
practicable
it
was
our
good
fortune
to
fall
in
with
an
old
and
able
pilot
at
inlet
one
capt
bloodgood
who
led
the
way
through
the
channel
in
his
schooner
the
a
carolina
pitch
and
cotton
droger
of
forty
tons
register
which
was
manned
solely
by
the
captain
and
his
two
sons
one
twelve
and
the
other
ten
years
old
it
was
in
the
crew
that
i
became
most
interested
and
not
the
schooner
bloodgood
gave
the
order
when
the
tide
served
for
us
to
put
to
sea
come
children
said
he
let
try
it
then
we
all
tried
it
together
the
leading
the
way
the
shaky
west
wind
that
filled
our
sails
as
we
skimmed
along
the
beach
with
the
breakers
close
aboard
carried
us
but
a
few
leagues
when
it
flew
suddenly
round
to
and
began
to
pipe
the
gale
increasing
rapidly
inclined
me
to
bear
up
for
new
river
inlet
then
close
under
our
lee
with
a
treacherous
bar
lying
in
front
which
to
cross
safely
would
require
great
care
but
the
gale
was
threatening
and
the
harbour
inside
we
could
see
was
smooth
then
too
cried
my
people
any
port
in
a
storm
i
decided
prompt
put
the
helm
up
and
squared
away
flying
thence
before
it
the
canoe
came
sweeping
in
from
sea
over
the
rollers
in
a
delightfully
thrilling
way
one
breaker
only
coming
over
us
and
even
that
did
no
harm
more
than
to
give
us
all
the
climax
soaking
of
the
voyage
this
was
the
last
sea
that
broke
over
the
canoe
on
the
memorable
voyage
the
harbour
inside
the
bar
of
new
river
was
good
adding
much
to
our
comfort
too
was
fish
and
game
in
abundance
the
which
had
parted
from
us
made
her
destined
port
some
three
leagues
farther
on
the
last
we
saw
of
the
children
they
were
at
the
main
sheets
hauling
aft
and
their
father
was
at
the
helm
and
all
were
flying
through
the
mist
like
fearless
sailors
after
meeting
carolina
seamen
to
say
nothing
of
the
few
still
in
existence
further
north
i
challenge
the
story
of
greek
supremacy
the
little
town
of
south
port
was
made
up
almost
entirely
of
pilots
possessing
i
am
sure
every
quality
of
the
sailor
and
the
gentleman
moored
snug
in
the
inlet
it
was
pleasant
to
listen
to
the
roar
of
the
breakers
on
the
bar
but
not
so
cheerful
was
the
thought
of
facing
the
high
waves
seaward
therefore
the
plan
suggested
itself
of
sufficiently
deepening
a
ditch
that
led
through
the
marshes
from
new
river
to
bogue
sound
to
let
us
through
thence
we
could
sail
inland
the
rest
of
the
voyage
without
obstruction
or
hindrance
of
any
kind
to
this
end
we
set
about
contrivances
to
heave
the
canoe
over
the
shoals
and
borrowed
a
shovel
from
a
friendly
schooner
captain
to
deepen
the
ditch
which
we
thought
would
be
necessary
to
do
in
order
to
ford
her
along
that
way
however
the
prevailing
gales
had
so
raised
the
water
in
the
west
end
of
the
sound
as
to
fill
all
the
creeks
and
ditches
to
overflowing
i
hesitated
then
no
longer
but
heading
for
the
ditch
through
the
marshes
on
a
high
tide
before
a
brave
west
wind
took
the
chances
of
getting
through
by
hook
or
by
crook
or
by
shovel
and
spade
if
required
the
coast
pilot
in
speaking
of
this
place
says
there
is
never
more
than
a
foot
of
water
there
and
even
that
much
is
rarely
found
the
essayed
the
ditch
drawing
two
feet
and
four
inches
thus
showing
the
further
good
fortune
or
luck
which
followed
perseverance
as
it
usually
does
though
sometimes
maybe
it
is
bad
luck
perhaps
i
am
not
lucid
on
this
which
at
best
must
remain
a
disputed
point
i
was
getting
lost
in
the
maze
of
sloughs
and
creeks
which
as
soon
as
i
entered
seemed
to
lead
in
every
direction
but
the
right
one
hailing
a
hunter
near
by
however
i
was
soon
put
straight
and
reassured
of
success
the
most
astonished
man
though
in
north
carolina
was
this
same
hunter
when
asked
if
he
knew
the
ditch
that
led
through
where
i
wished
to
go
why
stranger
said
he
my
digged
that
ditch
i
jumped
i
leaped
at
thought
of
what
a
pilot
this
man
would
be
well
stranger
said
he
in
reply
to
my
query
stranger
if
any
man
kin
take
y
thro
that
ditch
why
i
kin
adding
doubtfully
however
i
have
not
hearn
tell
befo
of
a
vessel
from
brazil
sailing
through
these
parts
but
then
you
mout
get
through
and
again
ye
moutent
well
it
jist
here
you
mout
and
you
moutent
a
bargain
was
quickly
made
and
my
pilot
came
aboard
armed
with
a
long
gun
which
as
we
sailed
along
proved
a
terror
to
ducks
the
entrance
to
the
ditch
then
close
by
was
made
with
a
flowing
sheet
and
i
soon
found
that
my
pilot
knew
his
business
and
we
left
to
port
and
to
starboard
and
were
at
times
out
of
sight
among
brakes
that
brushed
crackling
along
the
sides
of
the
canoe
as
she
swept
briskly
through
the
narrows
passing
them
all
with
many
a
close
hug
though
on
all
sides
at
a
point
well
on
in
the
crooked
channel
my
pilot
threw
up
his
hat
and
shouted
with
all
his
might
yer
trouble
is
over
swan
to
gosh
if
it
ai
and
ye
come
all
the
way
from
brazil
and
come
through
ditch
well
i
from
this
i
concluded
that
we
had
cleared
all
the
doubtful
places
and
so
it
turned
out
before
sundown
my
pilot
was
looking
for
the
change
of
a
and
we
of
the
sat
before
a
at
twilight
the
like
of
which
on
the
whole
voyage
had
not
been
tasted
from
sea
fowl
laid
about
by
our
pilot
while
sailing
through
the
meadows
and
marshes
and
the
pilot
himself
returning
while
the
was
yet
steaming
hot
declared
it
ahead
of
coon
a
pleasant
sail
was
this
through
the
ditch
that
dug
at
the
camp
fire
that
night
where
we
hauled
up
by
a
fishing
station
thirty
stalwart
men
talked
over
the
adventures
of
their
lives
my
pilot
the
best
speaker
kept
the
camp
in
roars
as
for
myself
always
fond
of
mirth
i
got
up
from
the
fire
sore
from
laughing
their
curious
adventures
with
coons
and
recounted
had
been
considerable
many
startling
stories
were
told
but
frequently
reverting
to
the
voyage
of
the
they
declared
with
one
voice
that
it
was
the
greatest
thing
since
the
wah
i
took
this
as
a
kind
of
complimentary
hospitality
when
she
struck
on
a
sand
reef
said
the
pilot
why
the
captain
he
jumped
right
overboard
and
the
son
he
jumped
right
over
too
to
tote
her
over
and
the
captain
wife
she
holp
by
daylight
next
morning
we
sailed
from
this
camp
pleasant
and
on
the
following
day
november
at
noon
arrived
at
beaufort
mayor
bell
of
that
city
and
many
of
his
townfolk
met
us
at
the
wharf
and
gave
me
as
well
as
my
crew
a
welcome
to
their
shores
such
as
to
make
us
feel
that
the
country
was
partly
ours
welcome
welcome
home
said
the
good
mayor
we
have
read
of
your
adventures
and
watched
your
progress
as
reported
from
time
to
time
with
deep
interest
and
sympathy
so
we
began
to
learn
now
that
prayers
on
shore
had
gone
up
for
the
little
canoe
at
sea
this
was
indeed
america
and
home
for
which
we
had
longed
while
thousands
of
miles
across
the
ocean
from
beaufort
to
norfolk
and
thence
to
washington
was
pleasant
inland
sailing
with
prevailing
fair
winds
and
smooth
sea
christmas
was
spent
on
the
chesapeake
a
fine
enjoyable
day
it
was
with
not
a
ripple
on
the
bay
ducks
swimming
ahead
of
the
canoe
as
she
moved
quietly
along
were
loath
to
take
wing
in
so
light
a
breeze
but
flapping
away
half
paddling
and
half
flying
as
we
came
toward
them
they
managed
to
keep
a
long
off
but
having
laid
in
at
the
last
port
a
turkey
of
no
mean
proportions
which
we
made
shift
to
roast
in
the
caboose
aboard
we
could
look
at
a
duck
without
wishing
its
destruction
with
this
turkey
and
a
bountiful
plum
duff
we
made
out
a
dinner
even
on
the
of
the
many
christmas
days
that
come
crowding
in
my
recollections
now
days
spent
on
the
sea
and
in
foreign
lands
as
falls
to
the
lot
of
sailors
which
was
the
merriest
it
would
be
hard
to
say
of
this
however
i
am
certain
that
the
one
on
board
the
on
the
chesapeake
was
not
the
least
happy
of
them
all
the
day
following
christmas
found
us
on
the
potomac
enjoying
the
same
fine
weather
and
abundant
good
cheer
of
the
day
before
fair
winds
carried
us
through
all
the
reaches
of
the
river
and
the
same
prosperity
which
attended
our
little
bark
in
the
beginning
of
the
voyage
through
tempestuous
weather
followed
her
to
the
end
of
the
voyage
which
terminated
in
mild
days
and
pleasant
sunshine
on
the
of
december
a
south
wind
bore
us
into
harbour
at
washington
there
we
moored
for
the
winter
furled
our
sails
and
coiled
up
the
ropes
after
a
voyage
of
joys
and
sorrows
crowned
with
pleasures
however
which
lessened
the
pain
of
past
regrets
having
moored
the
and
her
cables
it
remains
only
to
be
said
that
after
bringing
us
safely
through
the
dangers
of
a
tropical
voyage
clearing
reefs
shoals
breakers
and
all
storms
without
a
serious
accident
of
any
kind
we
learned
to
love
the
little
canoe
as
well
as
anything
could
be
loved
that
is
made
by
hands
to
say
that
we
had
not
a
moment
of
on
the
voyage
would
not
tell
the
whole
story
my
wife
brave
enough
to
face
the
worst
storms
as
women
are
sometimes
known
to
do
on
sea
and
on
land
enjoyed
not
only
the
best
of
health
but
had
gained
a
richer
complexion
victor
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
found
that
he
had
grown
an
inch
and
had
not
been
frightened
out
of
his
boots
little
garfield
well
he
had
grown
some
too
and
continued
to
be
a
pretty
good
boy
and
had
managed
to
hold
his
grip
through
many
ups
and
downs
he
it
was
who
stood
by
the
bow
line
to
make
fast
as
quick
as
the
came
to
the
pier
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
and
i
last
as
it
should
be
lost
a
few
pounds
weight
but
like
the
rest
landed
in
perfect
health
taking
it
altogether
therefore
only
pleasant
recollections
of
the
voyage
remain
with
us
who
made
it
with
all
its
vicissitudes
i
still
love
a
life
on
the
broad
free
ocean
never
regretting
the
choice
of
my
profession
however
the
time
has
come
to
debark
from
the
now
breasted
to
the
pier
where
i
leave
her
for
a
time
for
my
people
are
landed
safe
in
port
disposal
of
the
liberdade
about
the
middle
of
april
the
cast
loose
her
moorings
from
the
dock
at
washington
and
spreading
sail
before
a
brave
west
wind
bent
her
course
along
down
the
potomac
with
the
same
facility
as
experienced
in
december
coming
up
before
a
wind
from
the
south
then
shaping
her
course
for
new
york
via
baltimore
and
philadelphia
through
inland
passages
the
voyage
was
turned
into
a
pleasure
excursion
animation
of
spring
clothed
the
landscape
on
all
sides
in
its
greatest
beauty
and
our
northern
forest
the
voyagers
found
upon
their
return
was
not
less
charming
than
tropic
shade
of
foreign
climes
and
the
robin
sang
even
a
sweeter
trill
than
ever
before
heard
by
the
crew
for
they
listened
to
it
now
in
the
country
that
they
loved
from
new
york
the
sailed
for
boston
via
new
london
new
bedford
martha
vineyard
newport
and
taunton
at
which
latter
place
she
hauled
out
and
the
crew
thence
to
the
bay
state
capital
enjoyed
the
novelty
of
a
sail
over
land
then
the
moored
snug
in
boston
and
her
crew
spent
the
winter
again
among
friends
they
met
here
during
this
time
the
man
who
advised
the
captain
at
buenos
aires
to
pitch
the
cargo
of
hay
into
the
sea
for
not
taking
the
advice
witness
alas
the
captain
plight
finally
upon
return
of
spring
the
was
refitted
on
a
voyage
retracing
her
course
to
washington
where
following
safe
arrival
she
will
end
her
days
in
the
smithsonian
institution
a
haven
of
honour
that
many
will
be
glad
to
know
she
has
won
