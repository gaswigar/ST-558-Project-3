published
by
the
free
society
library
in
anarchy
anarchy
is
a
word
which
comes
from
the
greek
and
signifies
strictly
speaking
government
the
state
of
a
people
without
any
constituted
authority
that
is
without
government
before
such
an
organization
had
begun
to
be
considered
possible
and
desirable
by
a
whole
class
of
thinkers
so
as
to
be
taken
as
the
aim
of
a
party
which
party
has
now
become
one
of
the
most
important
factors
in
modern
social
warfare
the
word
anarchy
was
taken
universally
in
the
sense
of
disorder
and
confusion
and
it
is
still
adopted
in
that
sense
by
the
ignorant
and
by
adversaries
interested
in
distorting
the
truth
we
shall
not
enter
into
philological
discussions
for
the
question
is
not
philological
but
historical
the
common
meaning
of
the
word
does
not
misconceive
its
true
etymological
signification
but
is
derived
from
this
meaning
owing
to
the
prejudice
that
government
must
be
a
necessity
of
the
organization
of
social
life
and
that
consequently
a
society
without
government
must
be
given
up
to
disorder
and
oscillate
between
the
unbridled
dominion
of
some
and
the
blind
vengeance
of
others
the
existence
of
this
prejudice
and
its
influence
on
the
meaning
which
the
public
has
given
the
word
is
easily
explained
man
like
all
living
beings
adapts
and
habituates
himself
to
the
conditions
in
which
he
lives
and
transmits
by
inheritance
his
acquired
habits
thus
being
born
and
having
lived
in
bondage
being
the
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
slaves
man
when
he
began
to
think
believed
that
slavery
was
an
essential
condition
of
life
and
liberty
seemed
to
him
an
impossible
thing
in
like
manner
the
workman
forced
for
centuries
and
thus
habituated
to
depend
upon
the
good
will
of
his
employer
for
work
that
is
for
bread
and
accustomed
to
see
his
own
life
at
the
disposal
of
those
who
possess
the
land
and
the
capital
has
ended
in
believing
that
it
is
his
master
who
gives
him
to
eat
and
demands
ingenuously
how
it
would
be
possible
to
live
if
there
were
no
master
over
him
in
the
same
way
a
man
who
had
had
his
limbs
bound
from
his
birth
but
had
nevertheless
found
out
how
to
hobble
about
might
attribute
to
the
very
hands
that
bound
him
his
ability
to
move
while
on
the
contrary
they
would
be
diminishing
and
paralyzing
the
muscular
energy
of
his
limbs
if
then
we
add
to
the
natural
effect
of
habit
the
education
given
him
by
his
masters
the
parson
teacher
who
are
all
interested
in
teaching
that
the
employer
and
the
government
are
necessary
if
also
we
add
the
judge
and
the
bailiff
to
force
those
who
think
differently
and
might
try
to
propagate
their
opinions
to
keep
silence
we
shall
understand
how
the
prejudice
as
to
the
utility
and
necessity
of
masters
and
governments
has
become
established
suppose
a
doctor
brings
forward
a
complete
theory
with
a
thousand
ably
invented
illustrations
to
persuade
that
man
with
the
bound
limb
whom
we
were
describing
that
if
his
limb
were
freed
he
could
not
walk
could
not
even
live
the
man
would
defend
his
bands
furiously
and
consider
any
one
his
enemy
who
tried
to
tear
them
off
thus
since
it
is
believed
that
government
is
necessary
and
that
without
government
there
must
be
disorder
and
confusion
it
is
natural
and
logical
to
suppose
that
anarchy
which
signifies
without
government
must
also
mean
absence
of
order
nor
is
this
fact
without
parallel
in
the
history
of
words
in
those
epochs
and
countries
where
people
have
considered
government
by
one
man
monarchy
necessary
the
word
republic
that
is
the
government
of
many
has
been
used
precisely
like
anarchy
to
imply
disorder
and
confusion
traces
of
this
signification
of
the
word
are
still
to
be
found
in
the
popular
language
of
almost
all
countries
when
this
opinion
is
changed
and
the
public
convinced
that
government
is
not
necessary
but
extremely
harmful
the
word
anarchy
precisely
because
it
signifies
without
government
will
become
equal
to
saying
natural
order
harmony
of
the
needs
and
interests
of
all
complete
liberty
with
complete
solidarity
therefore
those
are
wrong
who
say
that
anarchists
have
chosen
their
name
badly
because
it
is
erroneously
understood
by
the
masses
and
leads
to
a
false
interpretation
the
error
does
not
come
from
the
word
but
from
the
thing
the
difficulty
which
anarchists
meet
with
in
spreading
their
views
does
not
depend
upon
the
name
they
have
given
themselves
but
upon
the
fact
that
their
conceptions
strike
at
all
the
inveterate
prejudices
that
people
have
about
the
function
of
government
or
the
as
it
is
called
before
proceeding
further
it
will
be
well
to
explain
this
last
word
the
state
which
in
our
opinion
is
the
real
cause
of
much
misunderstanding
anarchists
and
we
among
them
have
made
use
and
still
generally
make
use
of
the
word
state
meaning
thereby
that
collection
of
institutions
political
legislative
judicial
military
financial
by
means
of
which
the
management
of
their
own
affairs
the
guidance
of
their
personal
conduct
and
the
care
of
ensuring
their
own
safety
are
taken
from
the
people
and
confided
to
certain
individuals
and
these
whether
by
usurpation
or
delegation
are
invested
with
the
right
to
make
laws
over
and
for
all
and
to
constrain
the
public
to
respect
them
making
use
of
the
collective
force
of
the
community
to
this
end
in
this
case
the
word
state
means
government
or
if
you
like
it
is
the
impersonal
expression
abstracted
from
the
state
of
things
of
which
the
government
is
the
personification
then
such
expressions
as
abolition
of
the
state
or
society
without
the
state
agree
perfectly
with
the
conception
which
anarchists
wish
to
express
of
the
destruction
of
every
political
institution
based
on
authority
and
of
the
constitution
of
a
free
and
equal
society
based
upon
harmony
of
interests
and
the
voluntary
contribution
of
all
to
the
satisfaction
of
social
needs
however
the
word
state
has
many
other
significations
and
among
these
some
which
lend
themselves
to
misconstruction
particularly
when
used
among
men
whose
sad
social
position
has
not
afforded
them
leisure
to
become
accustomed
to
the
delicate
distinctions
of
scientific
language
or
still
worse
when
adopted
treacherously
by
adversaries
who
are
interested
in
confounding
the
sense
or
do
not
wish
to
comprehend
thus
the
word
state
is
often
used
to
indicate
any
given
society
or
collection
of
human
beings
united
on
a
given
territory
and
constituting
what
is
called
a
social
unit
independently
of
the
way
in
which
the
members
of
the
said
body
are
grouped
or
of
the
relations
existing
between
them
state
is
used
also
simply
as
a
synonym
for
society
owing
to
these
significations
of
the
word
our
adversaries
believe
or
rather
profess
to
believe
that
anarchists
wish
to
abolish
every
social
relation
and
all
collective
work
and
to
reduce
man
to
a
condition
of
isolation
that
is
to
a
state
worse
than
savagery
by
state
again
is
meant
only
the
supreme
administration
of
a
country
the
central
power
distinct
from
provincial
or
communal
power
and
therefore
others
think
that
anarchists
wish
merely
for
a
territorial
decentralization
leaving
the
principle
of
government
intact
and
thus
confounding
anarchy
with
cantonal
or
communal
government
finally
state
signifies
condition
mode
of
living
the
order
of
social
life
and
therefore
we
say
for
example
that
it
is
necessary
to
change
the
economic
state
of
the
working
classes
or
that
the
anarchical
state
is
the
only
state
founded
on
the
principles
of
solidarity
and
other
similar
phrases
so
that
if
we
say
also
in
another
sense
that
we
wish
to
abolish
the
state
we
may
at
once
appear
absurd
or
contradictory
for
these
reasons
we
believe
it
would
be
better
to
use
the
expression
of
the
as
little
as
possible
and
to
substitute
for
it
another
clearer
and
more
concrete
of
in
any
case
the
latter
will
be
the
expression
used
in
the
course
of
this
little
work
we
have
said
that
anarchy
is
society
without
government
but
is
the
suppression
of
government
possible
desirable
or
wise
let
us
see
what
is
the
government
there
is
a
disease
of
the
human
mind
called
the
metaphysical
tendency
causing
man
after
he
has
by
a
logical
process
abstracted
the
quality
from
an
object
to
be
subject
to
a
kind
of
hallucination
which
makes
him
take
the
abstraction
for
the
real
thing
this
metaphysical
tendency
in
spite
of
the
blows
of
positive
science
has
still
strong
root
in
the
minds
of
the
majority
of
our
contemporary
fellow
men
it
has
such
an
influence
that
many
consider
government
an
actual
entity
with
certain
given
attributes
of
reason
justice
equity
independently
of
the
people
who
compose
the
government
for
those
who
think
in
this
way
government
or
the
state
is
the
abstract
social
power
and
it
represents
always
in
the
abstract
the
general
interest
it
is
the
expression
of
the
right
of
all
and
considered
as
limited
by
the
rights
of
each
this
way
of
understanding
government
is
supported
by
those
interested
to
whom
it
is
an
urgent
necessity
that
the
principle
of
authority
should
be
maintained
and
should
always
survive
the
faults
and
errors
of
the
persons
who
succeed
to
the
exercise
of
power
for
us
the
government
is
the
aggregate
of
the
governors
and
the
governors
kings
presidents
ministers
members
of
parliament
and
what
not
are
those
who
have
the
power
to
make
laws
to
regulate
the
relations
between
men
and
to
force
obedience
to
these
laws
they
are
those
who
decide
upon
and
claim
the
taxes
enforce
military
service
judge
and
punish
transgressions
of
the
laws
they
subject
men
to
regulations
and
supervise
and
sanction
private
contracts
they
monopolize
certain
branches
of
production
and
public
services
or
if
they
wish
all
production
and
public
service
they
promote
or
hinder
the
exchange
of
goods
they
make
war
or
peace
with
the
governments
of
other
countries
they
concede
or
withhold
free
trade
and
many
things
else
in
short
the
governors
are
those
who
have
the
power
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
to
make
use
of
the
collective
force
of
society
that
is
of
the
physical
intellectual
and
economic
force
of
all
to
oblige
each
to
do
the
said
wish
and
this
power
constitutes
in
our
opinion
the
very
principle
of
government
the
principle
of
authority
but
what
reason
is
there
for
the
existence
of
government
why
abdicate
one
own
liberty
one
own
initiative
in
favor
of
other
individuals
why
give
them
the
power
to
be
the
masters
with
or
contrary
to
the
wish
of
each
to
dispose
of
the
forces
of
all
in
their
own
way
are
the
governors
such
very
exceptionally
gifted
men
as
to
enable
them
with
some
show
of
reason
to
represent
the
masses
and
act
in
the
interest
of
all
men
better
than
all
men
would
be
able
to
do
for
themselves
are
they
so
infallible
and
incorruptible
that
one
can
confide
to
them
with
any
semblance
of
prudence
the
fate
of
each
and
all
trusting
to
their
knowledge
and
their
goodness
and
even
if
there
existed
men
of
infinite
goodness
and
knowledge
even
if
we
assume
what
has
never
been
verified
in
history
and
what
we
believe
it
would
be
impossible
to
verify
namely
that
the
government
might
devolve
upon
the
ablest
and
best
would
the
possession
of
governmental
power
add
anything
to
their
beneficent
influence
would
it
not
rather
paralyze
or
destroy
it
for
those
who
govern
find
it
necessary
to
occupy
themselves
with
things
which
they
do
not
understand
and
above
all
to
waste
the
greater
part
of
their
energy
in
keeping
themselves
in
power
striving
to
satisfy
their
friends
holding
the
discontented
in
check
and
mastering
the
rebellious
again
be
the
governors
good
or
bad
wise
or
ignorant
who
is
it
that
appoints
them
to
their
office
do
they
impose
themselves
by
right
of
war
conquest
or
revolution
then
what
guarantees
have
the
public
that
their
rulers
have
the
general
good
at
heart
in
this
case
it
is
simply
a
question
of
usurpation
and
if
the
subjects
are
discontented
nothing
is
left
to
them
but
to
throw
off
the
yoke
by
an
appeal
to
arms
are
the
governors
chosen
from
a
certain
class
or
party
then
certainly
the
ideas
and
interests
of
that
class
or
party
will
triumph
and
the
wishes
and
interests
of
the
others
will
be
sacrificed
are
they
elected
by
universal
suffrage
now
numbers
are
the
sole
criterion
and
numbers
are
certainly
no
proof
of
reason
justice
or
capacity
under
universal
suffrage
the
elected
are
those
who
know
best
how
to
take
in
the
masses
the
minority
which
may
happen
to
be
half
minus
one
is
sacrificed
and
that
without
considering
that
there
is
another
thing
to
take
into
account
experience
has
shown
it
is
impossible
to
hit
upon
an
electoral
system
which
really
ensures
election
by
the
actual
majority
many
and
various
are
the
theories
by
which
men
have
sought
to
justify
the
existence
of
government
all
however
are
founded
confessedly
or
not
on
the
assumption
that
the
individuals
of
a
society
have
contrary
interests
and
that
an
external
superior
power
is
necessary
to
oblige
some
to
respect
the
interests
of
others
by
prescribing
and
imposing
a
rule
of
conduct
according
to
which
the
interests
at
strife
may
be
harmonized
as
much
as
possible
and
according
to
which
each
obtains
the
maximum
of
satisfaction
with
the
minimum
of
sacrifice
if
say
the
theorists
of
the
authoritarian
school
the
interests
tendencies
and
desires
of
an
individual
are
in
opposition
to
those
of
another
individual
or
mayhap
all
society
who
will
have
the
right
and
the
power
to
oblige
the
one
to
respect
the
interests
of
the
others
who
will
be
able
to
prevent
the
individual
citizen
from
offending
the
general
will
the
liberty
of
each
say
they
has
for
its
limit
the
liberty
of
others
but
who
will
establish
those
limits
and
who
will
cause
them
to
be
respected
the
natural
antagonism
of
interests
and
passions
creates
the
necessity
for
government
and
justifies
authority
authority
intervenes
as
moderator
of
the
social
strife
and
defines
the
limits
of
the
rights
and
duties
of
each
this
is
the
theory
but
the
theory
to
be
sound
ought
to
be
based
upon
facts
and
to
explain
them
we
know
well
how
in
social
economy
theories
are
too
often
invented
to
justify
facts
that
is
to
defend
privilege
and
cause
it
to
be
accepted
tranquilly
by
those
who
are
its
victims
let
us
here
look
at
the
facts
themselves
in
all
the
course
of
history
as
at
the
present
epoch
government
is
either
the
brutal
violent
arbitrary
domination
of
the
few
over
the
many
or
it
is
an
instrument
ordained
to
secure
domination
and
privilege
to
those
who
by
force
or
cunning
or
inheritance
have
taken
to
themselves
all
the
means
of
life
and
first
and
foremost
the
soil
whereby
they
hold
the
people
in
servitude
making
them
work
for
their
advantage
governments
oppress
mankind
in
two
ways
either
directly
by
brute
force
that
is
physical
violence
or
indirectly
by
depriving
them
of
the
means
of
subsistence
and
thus
reducing
them
to
helplessness
at
discretion
political
power
originated
in
the
first
method
economic
privilege
arose
from
the
second
governments
can
also
oppress
man
by
acting
on
his
emotional
nature
and
in
this
way
constitute
religious
authority
but
there
is
no
reason
for
the
propagation
of
religious
superstitions
except
that
they
defend
and
consolidate
political
and
economic
privileges
in
primitive
society
when
the
world
was
not
so
densely
populated
as
now
and
social
relations
were
less
complicated
when
any
circumstance
prevented
the
formation
of
habits
and
customs
of
solidarity
or
destroyed
those
which
already
existed
and
established
the
domination
of
man
over
man
the
two
powers
the
political
and
the
economical
were
united
in
the
same
hands
and
often
also
in
those
of
one
single
individual
those
who
had
by
force
conquered
and
impoverished
the
others
constrained
them
to
become
their
servants
and
perform
all
things
for
them
according
to
their
caprice
the
victors
were
at
once
proprietors
legislators
kings
judges
and
executioners
but
with
the
increase
of
population
with
the
growth
of
needs
with
the
complication
of
social
relationships
the
prolonged
continuance
of
such
despotism
became
impossible
for
their
own
security
the
rulers
often
much
against
their
will
were
obliged
to
depend
upon
a
privileged
class
that
is
a
certain
number
of
individuals
and
were
also
obliged
to
let
each
of
these
individuals
provide
for
his
own
sustenance
nevertheless
they
reserved
to
themselves
the
supreme
or
ultimate
control
in
other
words
the
rulers
reserved
to
themselves
the
right
to
exploit
all
at
their
own
convenience
and
so
to
satisfy
their
kingly
vanity
thus
private
wealth
was
developed
under
the
shadow
of
the
ruling
power
for
its
protection
and
often
unconsciously
as
its
accomplice
thus
the
class
of
proprietors
rose
and
they
concentrating
little
by
little
the
means
of
wealth
in
their
own
hands
all
the
means
of
production
the
very
fountains
of
life
agriculture
industry
and
exchange
ended
by
becoming
a
power
in
themselves
this
power
by
the
superiority
of
its
means
of
action
and
the
great
mass
of
interests
it
embraces
always
ends
by
more
or
less
openly
subjugating
the
political
power
that
is
the
government
which
it
makes
its
policeman
this
phenomenon
has
been
reproduced
often
in
history
every
time
that
by
invasion
or
any
military
enterprise
whatever
physical
brute
force
has
taken
the
upper
hand
in
society
the
conquerors
have
shown
the
tendency
to
concentrate
government
and
property
in
their
own
hands
in
every
case
however
as
the
government
can
not
attend
to
the
production
of
wealth
and
overlook
and
direct
everything
it
finds
it
needful
to
conciliate
a
powerful
class
and
private
property
is
again
established
with
it
comes
the
division
of
the
two
sorts
of
power
that
of
the
persons
who
control
the
collective
force
of
society
and
that
of
the
proprietors
upon
whom
these
governors
become
essentially
independent
because
the
proprietors
command
the
sources
of
the
said
collective
force
but
never
has
this
state
of
things
been
so
accentuated
as
in
modern
times
the
development
of
production
the
immense
extension
of
commerce
the
extensive
power
that
money
has
acquired
and
all
the
economic
results
flowing
from
the
discovery
of
america
the
invention
of
machinery
have
secured
such
supremacy
to
the
capitalist
class
that
it
is
no
longer
content
to
trust
to
the
support
of
the
government
and
has
come
to
wish
that
the
government
shall
emanate
from
itself
a
government
composed
of
members
of
its
own
class
continually
under
its
control
and
especially
organized
to
defend
its
class
against
the
possible
revenge
of
the
disinherited
hence
the
origin
of
the
modern
parliamentary
system
today
the
government
is
composed
of
proprietors
or
people
of
their
class
so
entirely
under
their
influence
that
the
richest
of
them
do
not
find
it
necessary
to
take
an
active
part
in
it
themselves
rothschild
for
instance
does
not
need
to
be
either
or
minister
it
is
enough
for
him
to
keep
and
ministers
dependent
upon
himself
in
many
countries
the
proletariat
participates
nominally
more
or
less
in
the
election
of
the
government
this
is
a
concession
which
the
proprietory
class
have
made
either
to
avail
themselves
of
popular
support
in
the
strife
against
royal
or
aristocratic
power
or
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
people
from
their
own
emancipation
by
giving
them
an
apparent
share
in
political
power
however
whether
the
foresaw
it
or
not
when
first
they
conceded
to
the
people
the
right
to
vote
the
fact
is
that
the
right
has
proved
in
reality
a
mockery
serving
only
to
consolidate
the
power
of
the
while
giving
to
the
most
energetic
only
of
the
proletariat
the
illusory
hope
of
arriving
at
power
so
also
with
universal
suffrage
we
might
say
especially
with
universal
suffrage
the
government
has
remained
the
servant
and
police
of
the
class
how
could
it
be
otherwise
if
the
government
should
reach
the
point
of
becoming
hostile
if
the
hope
of
democracy
should
ever
be
more
than
a
delusion
deceiving
the
people
the
proprietory
class
menaced
in
its
interests
would
at
once
rebel
and
would
use
all
the
force
and
influence
which
come
from
the
possession
of
wealth
to
reduce
the
government
to
the
simple
function
of
acting
as
policeman
in
all
times
and
in
all
places
whatever
may
be
the
name
that
the
government
takes
whatever
has
been
its
origin
or
its
organization
its
essential
function
is
always
that
of
oppressing
and
exploiting
the
masses
and
of
defending
the
oppressors
and
exploiters
its
principal
characteristic
and
indispensable
instruments
are
the
bailiff
and
the
tax
collector
the
soldier
and
the
prison
and
to
these
are
necessarily
added
the
priest
or
teacher
as
the
case
may
be
supported
and
protected
by
the
government
to
render
the
spirit
of
the
people
servile
and
make
them
docile
under
the
yoke
certainly
in
addition
to
this
primary
business
to
this
essential
department
of
governmental
action
other
departments
have
been
added
in
the
course
of
time
we
even
admit
that
never
or
hardly
ever
has
a
government
been
able
to
exist
in
a
country
that
was
at
all
civilized
without
adding
to
its
oppressing
and
exploiting
functions
others
useful
and
indispensable
to
social
life
but
this
fact
makes
it
none
the
less
true
that
government
is
in
its
nature
oppressive
and
a
means
of
exploitation
and
that
its
origin
and
position
doom
it
to
be
the
defence
and
of
a
dominant
class
thus
confirming
and
increasing
the
evils
of
domination
the
government
assumes
the
business
of
protecting
more
or
less
vigilantly
the
life
of
citizens
against
direct
and
brutal
attacks
acknowledges
and
legalizes
a
certain
number
of
rights
and
primitive
usages
and
customs
without
which
it
is
impossible
to
live
in
society
it
organizes
and
directs
certain
public
services
as
the
post
preservation
and
construction
of
roads
care
of
the
public
health
benevolent
institutions
workhouses
and
such
like
and
it
pleases
it
to
pose
as
the
protector
and
benefactor
of
the
poor
and
weak
but
it
is
sufficient
to
notice
how
and
why
it
fulfils
these
functions
to
prove
our
point
the
fact
is
that
everything
the
government
undertakes
it
is
always
inspired
with
the
spirit
of
domination
and
ordained
to
defend
enlarge
and
perpetuate
the
privileges
of
property
and
those
classes
of
which
government
is
the
representative
and
defender
a
government
can
not
rule
for
any
length
of
time
without
hiding
its
true
nature
behind
the
pretence
of
general
utility
it
can
not
respect
the
lives
of
the
privileged
without
assuming
the
air
of
wishing
to
respect
the
lives
of
all
it
can
not
cause
the
privileges
of
some
to
be
tolerated
without
appearing
as
the
custodian
of
the
rights
of
everybody
the
law
and
of
course
those
that
have
made
the
law
that
is
the
government
has
utilized
says
kropotkin
the
social
sentiments
of
man
working
into
them
those
precepts
of
morality
which
man
has
accepted
together
with
arrangements
useful
to
the
minority
the
exploiters
and
opposed
to
the
interests
of
those
who
might
have
rebelled
had
it
not
been
for
this
show
of
a
moral
ground
a
government
can
not
wish
the
destruction
of
the
community
for
then
it
and
the
dominant
class
could
not
claim
their
wealth
nor
could
the
government
leave
the
community
to
manage
its
own
affairs
for
then
the
people
would
soon
discover
that
it
the
government
was
necessary
for
no
other
end
than
to
defend
the
proprietory
class
who
impoverish
them
and
would
hasten
to
rid
themselves
of
both
government
and
proprietory
class
today
in
the
face
of
the
persistent
and
menacing
demands
of
the
proletariat
governments
show
a
tendency
to
interfere
in
the
relations
between
employers
and
work
people
thus
they
try
to
arrest
the
labor
movement
and
to
impede
with
delusive
reforms
the
attempts
of
the
poor
to
take
to
themselves
that
which
is
due
to
them
namely
an
equal
share
of
the
good
things
of
life
which
others
enjoy
we
must
also
remember
that
on
the
one
hand
the
bourgeois
that
is
the
proprietory
class
make
war
among
themselves
and
destroy
one
another
continually
and
on
the
other
hand
that
the
government
although
composed
of
the
and
acting
as
their
servant
and
protector
is
still
like
every
other
servant
or
protector
continually
striving
to
emancipate
itself
and
to
domineer
over
its
charge
thus
this
game
this
swaying
between
conceding
and
withdrawing
this
seeking
allies
among
the
people
against
the
classes
and
among
the
classes
against
the
masses
forms
the
science
of
the
governors
and
blinds
the
ingenuous
and
phlegmatic
who
are
always
expecting
that
salvation
is
coming
to
them
from
on
high
with
all
this
the
government
does
not
change
its
nature
if
it
acts
as
regulator
or
guarantor
of
the
rights
and
duties
of
each
it
perverts
the
sentiment
of
justice
it
justifies
wrong
and
punishes
every
act
which
offends
or
menaces
the
privileges
of
the
governors
and
proprietors
it
declares
just
the
most
atrocious
exploitation
of
the
miserable
which
means
a
slow
and
continuous
material
and
moral
murder
perpetrated
by
those
who
have
on
those
who
have
not
again
if
it
administrates
public
services
it
always
considers
the
interests
of
the
governors
and
proprietors
not
occupying
itself
with
the
interests
of
the
working
masses
except
in
so
far
as
is
necessary
to
make
the
masses
willing
to
endure
their
share
of
taxation
if
it
instructs
it
fetters
and
curtails
the
truth
and
tends
to
prepare
the
mind
and
heart
of
the
young
to
become
either
implacable
tyrants
or
docile
slaves
according
to
the
class
to
which
they
belong
in
the
hands
of
the
government
everything
becomes
a
means
of
exploitation
everything
serves
as
a
police
measure
useful
to
hold
the
people
in
check
and
it
must
be
thus
if
the
life
of
mankind
consists
in
strife
between
man
and
man
naturally
there
must
be
conquerors
and
conquered
and
the
government
which
is
the
prize
of
the
strife
or
is
a
means
of
securing
to
the
victors
the
results
of
their
victory
and
perpetuating
those
results
will
certainly
never
fall
to
those
who
have
lost
whether
the
battle
be
on
the
grounds
of
physical
or
intellectual
strength
or
in
the
field
of
economics
and
those
who
have
fought
to
conquer
that
is
to
secure
to
themselves
better
conditions
than
others
can
have
to
conquer
privilege
and
add
dominion
to
power
and
have
attained
the
victory
will
certainly
not
use
it
to
defend
the
rights
of
the
vanquished
and
to
place
limits
to
their
own
power
and
to
that
of
their
friends
and
partizans
the
government
or
the
state
if
you
will
as
judge
moderator
of
social
strife
impartial
administrator
of
the
public
interests
is
a
lie
it
is
an
illusion
a
utopia
never
realized
and
never
realizable
if
in
truth
the
interests
of
men
must
always
be
contrary
to
one
another
if
indeed
the
strife
between
mankind
has
made
laws
necessary
to
human
society
and
the
liberty
of
the
individual
must
be
limited
by
the
liberty
of
other
individuals
then
each
one
would
always
seek
to
make
his
interests
triumph
over
those
of
others
each
would
strive
to
enlarge
his
own
liberty
at
the
cost
of
the
liberty
of
others
and
there
would
be
government
not
simply
because
it
was
more
or
less
useful
to
the
totality
of
the
members
of
society
to
have
a
government
but
because
the
conquerors
would
wish
to
secure
to
themselves
the
fruits
of
victory
they
would
wish
effectually
to
subject
the
vanquished
and
relieve
themselves
of
the
trouble
of
being
always
on
the
defensive
and
they
would
appoint
men
specially
adapted
to
the
business
to
act
as
police
were
this
indeed
actually
the
case
then
humanity
would
be
destined
to
perish
amidst
periodical
contests
between
the
tyranny
of
the
dominators
and
the
rebellion
of
the
conquered
but
fortunately
the
future
of
humanity
is
a
happier
one
because
the
law
which
governs
it
is
milder
this
law
is
the
law
of
i
man
has
two
necessary
fundamental
characteristics
instinct
of
his
own
without
which
no
being
could
exist
and
instinct
of
the
preservation
of
his
without
which
no
species
could
have
been
formed
or
have
continued
to
exist
he
is
naturally
driven
to
defend
his
own
existence
and
and
that
of
his
offspring
against
every
danger
in
nature
living
beings
find
two
ways
of
securing
their
existence
and
rendering
it
pleasanter
the
one
is
in
individual
strife
with
the
elements
and
with
other
individuals
of
the
same
or
different
species
the
other
is
or
which
might
also
be
described
as
association
for
strife
against
all
natural
factors
destructive
to
existence
or
to
the
development
and
of
the
associated
we
do
not
need
to
investigate
in
these
pages
and
we
can
not
for
lack
of
space
what
respective
proportions
in
the
evolution
of
the
organic
world
these
two
principles
of
strife
and
take
it
will
suffice
to
note
how
among
men
whether
forced
or
voluntary
has
become
the
sole
means
of
progress
of
improvement
or
of
securing
safety
and
how
strife
relic
of
an
earlier
stage
of
existence
has
become
thoroughly
unsuitable
as
a
means
of
securing
the
of
individuals
and
produces
instead
injury
to
all
both
the
conquerors
and
the
conquered
the
accumulated
and
transmitted
experience
of
successive
generations
has
taught
man
that
by
uniting
with
other
men
his
preservation
is
better
secured
and
his
increased
thus
out
of
this
same
strife
for
existence
carried
on
against
surrounding
nature
and
against
individuals
of
their
own
species
the
social
instinct
has
been
developed
among
men
and
has
completely
transformed
the
conditions
of
their
life
through
man
has
been
enabled
to
evolve
out
of
animalism
has
risen
to
great
power
and
elevated
himself
to
such
a
degree
above
the
other
animals
that
metaphysical
philosophers
have
believed
it
necessary
to
invent
for
him
an
immaterial
and
immortal
soul
many
concurrent
causes
have
contributed
to
the
formation
of
this
social
instinct
that
starting
from
the
animal
basis
of
the
instinct
for
the
preservation
of
the
species
has
now
become
so
extended
and
so
intense
that
it
constitutes
the
essential
element
of
man
moral
nature
man
however
he
evolved
from
inferior
animal
types
was
a
physically
weak
being
unarmed
for
the
fight
against
carnivorous
beasts
but
he
was
possessed
of
a
brain
capable
of
great
development
and
a
vocal
organ
able
to
express
the
various
cerebral
vibrations
by
means
of
diverse
sounds
and
hands
adapted
to
give
the
desired
form
to
matter
he
must
have
very
soon
felt
the
need
and
advantages
of
association
with
his
fellows
indeed
it
may
even
be
said
that
he
could
only
rise
out
of
animalism
when
he
became
social
and
had
acquired
the
use
of
language
which
is
at
the
same
time
a
consequence
and
a
potent
factor
of
sociability
the
relatively
scanty
number
of
the
human
species
rendered
the
strife
for
existence
between
man
and
man
even
beyond
the
limits
of
association
less
sharp
less
continuous
and
less
necessary
at
the
same
time
it
must
have
greatly
favored
the
development
of
sympathetic
sentiments
and
have
left
time
for
the
discovery
and
appreciation
of
the
utility
of
mutual
support
in
short
social
life
became
the
necessary
condition
of
man
existence
in
consequence
of
his
capacity
to
modify
his
external
surroundings
and
adapt
them
to
his
own
wants
by
the
exercise
of
his
primeval
power
in
with
a
greater
or
less
number
of
associates
his
desires
have
multiplied
with
the
means
of
satisfying
them
and
have
become
needs
and
division
of
labor
has
arisen
from
methodical
use
of
nature
for
his
own
advantage
therefore
as
now
evolved
man
could
not
live
apart
from
his
fellows
without
falling
back
into
a
state
of
animalism
through
the
refinement
of
sensibility
with
the
multiplication
of
social
relationships
and
through
habit
impressed
on
the
species
by
hereditary
transmission
for
thousands
of
centuries
this
need
of
social
life
this
interchange
of
thought
and
of
affection
between
man
and
man
has
become
a
mode
of
being
necessary
for
our
organism
it
has
been
transformed
into
sympathy
friendship
and
love
and
subsists
independently
of
the
material
advantages
that
association
procures
so
much
is
this
the
case
that
man
will
often
face
suffering
of
every
kind
and
even
death
for
the
satisfaction
of
these
sentiments
the
fact
is
that
a
totally
different
character
has
been
given
to
the
strife
for
existence
between
man
and
man
and
between
the
inferior
animals
by
the
enormous
advantages
that
association
gives
to
man
by
the
fact
that
his
physical
powers
are
altogether
disproportionate
to
his
intellectual
superiority
over
the
beasts
so
long
as
he
remains
isolated
by
his
possibility
of
associating
with
an
ever
increasing
number
of
individuals
and
entering
into
more
and
more
intricate
and
complex
relationships
until
he
reaches
association
with
all
humanity
and
finally
perhaps
more
than
all
by
his
ability
to
produce
working
in
with
others
more
than
he
needs
to
live
upon
it
is
evident
that
these
causes
together
with
the
sentiments
of
affection
derived
from
them
must
give
quite
a
peculiar
character
to
the
struggle
for
existence
among
human
beings
although
it
is
now
known
and
the
researches
of
modern
naturalists
bring
us
every
day
new
proofs
that
has
played
and
still
plays
a
most
important
part
in
the
development
of
the
organic
world
nevertheless
the
difference
between
the
human
struggle
for
existence
and
that
of
the
inferior
animals
is
enormous
it
is
in
fact
proportionate
to
the
distance
separating
man
from
the
other
animals
and
this
is
none
the
less
true
because
of
that
darwinian
theory
which
the
class
have
ridden
to
death
little
suspecting
the
extent
to
which
mutual
has
assisted
in
the
development
of
the
lower
animals
the
lower
animals
fight
either
individually
or
more
often
in
little
permanent
or
transitory
groups
against
all
nature
the
other
individuals
of
their
own
species
included
some
of
the
more
social
animals
such
as
ants
bees
associate
together
in
the
same
anthill
or
beehive
but
are
at
war
with
or
indifferent
towards
other
communities
of
their
own
species
human
strife
with
nature
on
the
contrary
tends
always
to
broaden
association
among
men
to
unite
their
interests
and
to
develop
each
sentiments
of
affection
towards
all
others
so
that
united
they
may
conquer
and
dominate
the
dangers
of
external
nature
by
and
for
humanity
all
strife
directed
towards
obtaining
advantages
independently
of
other
men
and
in
opposition
to
them
contradicts
the
social
nature
of
modern
man
and
tends
to
lead
it
back
to
a
more
animal
condition
that
is
harmony
of
interests
and
sentiments
the
sharing
of
each
in
the
good
of
all
and
of
all
in
the
good
of
each
is
the
state
in
which
alone
man
can
be
true
to
his
own
nature
and
attain
to
the
highest
development
and
happiness
it
is
the
aim
towards
which
human
development
tends
it
is
the
one
great
principle
capable
of
reconciling
all
present
antagonisms
in
society
otherwise
irreconcilable
it
causes
the
liberty
of
each
to
find
not
its
limits
but
its
complement
the
necessary
condition
of
its
continual
existence
in
the
liberty
of
all
no
man
says
michael
bakunin
can
recognize
his
own
human
worth
nor
in
consequence
realize
his
full
development
if
he
does
not
recognize
the
worth
of
his
fellow
men
and
in
with
them
realize
his
own
development
through
them
no
man
can
emancipate
himself
unless
at
the
same
time
he
emancipates
those
around
him
my
freedom
is
the
freedom
of
all
for
i
am
not
really
free
free
not
only
in
thought
but
in
deed
if
my
freedom
and
my
right
do
not
find
their
confirmation
and
sanction
in
the
liberty
and
right
of
all
men
my
equals
it
matters
much
to
me
what
all
other
men
are
for
however
independent
i
may
seem
or
may
believe
myself
to
be
by
virtue
of
my
social
position
whether
as
pope
czar
emperor
or
prime
minister
i
am
all
the
while
the
product
of
those
who
are
the
least
among
men
if
these
are
ignorant
miserable
or
enslaved
my
existence
is
limited
by
their
ignorance
misery
or
slavery
i
though
an
intelligent
and
enlightened
man
am
made
stupid
by
their
stupidity
though
brave
am
enslaved
by
their
slavery
though
rich
tremble
before
their
poverty
though
privileged
grow
pale
at
the
thought
of
possible
justice
for
them
i
who
wish
to
be
free
can
not
be
so
because
around
me
are
men
who
do
not
yet
desire
freedom
and
not
desiring
it
become
as
opposed
to
me
the
instruments
of
my
oppression
solidarity
then
is
the
condition
in
which
man
can
attain
the
highest
degree
of
security
and
of
therefore
egoism
itself
that
is
the
exclusive
consideration
of
individual
interests
impels
man
and
human
society
towards
solidarity
or
rather
egoism
and
altruism
consideration
of
the
interests
of
others
are
united
in
this
one
sentiment
as
the
interest
of
the
individual
is
one
with
the
interests
of
society
however
man
could
not
pass
at
once
from
animalism
to
humanity
from
brutal
strife
between
man
and
man
to
the
collective
strife
of
all
mankind
united
in
one
brotherhood
of
mutual
aid
against
external
nature
guided
by
the
advantages
that
association
and
the
consequent
division
of
labor
offer
man
evolved
towards
solidarity
but
his
evolution
encountered
an
obstacle
which
led
him
and
still
leads
him
away
from
his
aim
he
discovered
that
he
could
realize
the
advantages
of
at
least
up
to
a
certain
point
and
for
the
material
and
primitive
wants
that
then
comprised
all
his
needs
by
making
other
men
subject
to
himself
instead
of
associating
on
an
equality
with
them
thus
the
ferocious
and
instincts
inherited
from
his
bestial
ancestry
again
obtained
the
upper
hand
he
forced
the
weaker
to
work
for
him
preferring
to
domineer
over
rather
than
to
associate
fraternally
with
his
fellows
perhaps
also
in
most
cases
it
was
by
exploiting
the
conquered
in
war
that
man
learnt
for
the
first
time
the
benefits
of
association
and
the
help
that
can
be
obtained
from
mutual
support
thus
it
has
come
about
that
the
establishment
of
the
utility
of
which
ought
to
lead
to
the
triumph
of
solidarity
in
all
human
concerns
has
turned
to
the
advantage
of
private
property
and
of
government
in
other
words
to
the
exploitation
of
the
labor
of
the
many
for
the
sake
of
the
privileged
few
there
has
always
been
association
and
without
which
human
life
would
be
impossible
but
it
has
been
imposed
and
regulated
by
the
few
in
their
own
particular
interest
from
this
fact
arises
a
great
contradiction
with
which
the
history
of
mankind
is
filled
on
the
one
hand
we
find
the
tendency
to
associate
and
fraternize
for
the
purpose
of
conquering
and
adapting
the
external
world
to
human
needs
and
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
human
affections
while
on
the
other
hand
we
see
the
tendency
to
divide
into
as
many
separate
and
hostile
factions
as
there
are
different
conditions
of
life
these
factions
are
determined
for
instance
by
geographical
and
ethnological
conditions
by
differences
in
economic
position
by
privileges
acquired
by
some
and
sought
to
be
secured
by
others
or
by
suffering
endured
with
the
ever
recurring
desire
to
rebel
the
principle
of
each
for
himself
that
is
of
war
of
all
against
all
has
come
in
the
course
of
time
to
complicate
lead
astray
and
paralyze
the
war
of
all
combined
against
nature
for
the
common
advantage
of
the
human
race
which
could
only
be
completely
successful
by
acting
on
the
principle
of
all
for
each
and
each
for
all
great
have
been
the
evils
which
humanity
has
suffered
by
this
intermingling
of
domination
and
exploitation
with
human
association
but
in
spite
of
the
atrocious
oppression
to
which
the
masses
submit
of
the
misery
vice
crime
and
degradation
which
oppression
and
slavery
produce
among
the
slaves
and
their
masters
and
in
spite
of
the
hatreds
the
exterminating
wars
and
the
antagonisms
of
artificially
created
interests
the
social
instinct
has
survived
and
even
developed
having
been
always
the
necessary
condition
for
successful
combat
against
external
nature
has
therefore
been
the
permanent
cause
of
men
coming
together
and
consequently
of
the
development
of
their
sympathetic
sentiments
even
the
oppression
of
the
masses
has
itself
caused
the
oppressed
to
fraternize
among
themselves
indeed
it
has
been
solely
owing
to
this
feeling
of
solidarity
more
or
less
conscious
and
more
or
less
widespread
among
the
oppressed
that
they
have
been
able
to
endure
the
oppression
and
that
man
has
resisted
the
causes
of
death
in
his
midst
in
the
present
the
immense
development
of
production
the
growth
of
human
needs
which
can
not
be
satisfied
except
by
the
united
efforts
of
a
large
number
of
men
in
all
countries
the
extended
means
of
communication
habits
of
travel
science
literature
commerce
even
war
itself
all
these
have
drawn
and
are
still
drawing
humanity
into
a
compact
body
every
section
of
which
closely
knit
together
can
find
its
satisfaction
and
liberty
only
in
the
development
and
health
of
all
other
sections
composing
the
whole
the
inhabitant
of
naples
is
as
much
interested
in
the
amelioration
of
the
hygienic
condition
of
the
peoples
on
the
banks
of
the
ganges
from
whence
the
cholera
is
brought
to
him
as
in
the
improvement
of
the
sewerage
of
his
own
town
the
liberty
or
fortune
of
the
mountaineer
lost
among
the
precipices
of
the
appenines
does
not
depend
alone
on
the
state
of
or
of
misery
in
which
the
inhabitants
of
his
own
village
live
or
even
on
the
general
condition
of
the
italian
people
but
also
on
the
condition
of
the
workers
in
america
or
australia
on
the
discovery
of
a
swedish
scientist
on
the
moral
and
material
conditions
of
the
chinese
on
war
or
peace
in
africa
in
short
it
depends
on
all
the
great
and
small
circumstances
which
affect
the
human
being
in
any
spot
whatever
of
the
world
in
the
present
condition
of
society
the
vast
solidarity
which
unites
all
men
is
in
a
great
degree
unconscious
since
it
arises
spontaneously
from
the
friction
of
particular
interests
while
men
occupy
themselves
little
or
not
at
all
with
general
interests
and
this
is
the
most
evident
proof
that
solidarity
is
the
natural
law
of
human
life
which
imposes
itself
so
to
speak
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
and
even
those
artificially
created
by
society
as
at
present
constituted
on
the
other
hand
the
oppressed
masses
never
wholly
resigned
to
oppression
and
misery
who
today
more
than
ever
show
themselves
ardent
for
justice
liberty
and
are
beginning
to
understand
that
they
can
not
emancipate
themselves
except
by
uniting
through
solidarity
with
all
the
oppressed
and
exploited
over
the
whole
world
and
they
understand
also
that
the
indispensable
condition
of
their
emancipation
is
the
possession
of
the
means
of
production
of
the
soil
and
of
the
instruments
of
labor
and
further
the
abolition
of
private
property
science
and
the
observation
of
social
phenomena
show
that
this
abolition
would
be
of
immense
advantage
in
the
end
even
to
the
privileged
classes
if
only
they
could
bring
themselves
to
renounce
the
spirit
of
domination
and
concur
with
all
their
fellow
men
in
laboring
for
the
common
good
now
should
the
oppressed
masses
some
day
refuse
to
work
for
their
oppressors
should
they
take
possession
of
the
soil
and
the
instruments
of
labor
and
apply
them
for
their
own
use
and
advantage
and
that
of
all
who
work
should
they
no
longer
submit
to
the
domination
either
of
brute
force
or
economic
privilege
should
the
spirit
of
human
fellowship
and
the
sentiment
of
human
solidarity
strengthened
by
common
interests
grow
among
the
people
and
put
an
end
to
strife
between
nations
then
what
ground
would
there
be
for
the
existence
of
a
government
private
property
abolished
government
which
is
its
defender
must
disappear
should
it
survive
it
would
continually
tend
to
reconstruct
under
one
form
or
another
a
privileged
and
oppressive
class
and
the
abolition
of
government
does
not
nor
can
not
signify
the
doing
away
with
human
association
far
otherwise
for
that
which
today
is
enforced
and
directed
to
the
advantage
of
the
few
would
be
free
and
voluntary
directed
to
the
advantage
of
all
therefore
it
would
become
more
intense
and
efficacious
the
social
instinct
and
the
sentiment
of
solidarity
would
develop
to
the
highest
degree
and
every
individual
would
do
all
in
his
power
for
the
good
of
others
as
much
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
own
well
understood
interests
as
for
the
gratification
of
his
sympathetic
sentiments
by
the
free
association
of
all
a
social
organization
would
arise
through
the
spontaneous
grouping
of
men
according
to
their
needs
and
sympathies
from
the
low
to
the
high
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
starting
from
the
more
immediate
to
arrive
at
the
more
distant
and
general
interests
this
organization
would
have
for
its
aim
the
greatest
good
and
fullest
liberty
to
all
it
would
embrace
all
humanity
in
one
common
brotherhood
and
would
be
modified
and
improved
as
circumstances
were
modified
and
changed
according
to
the
teachings
of
experience
this
society
of
this
society
of
would
be
ii
we
have
hitherto
considered
government
as
it
is
and
as
it
necessarily
must
be
in
a
society
founded
upon
privilege
upon
the
exploitation
and
oppression
of
man
by
man
upon
antagonism
of
interests
and
social
strife
in
a
word
upon
private
property
we
have
seen
how
this
state
of
strife
far
from
being
a
necessary
condition
of
human
life
is
contrary
to
the
interests
of
the
individual
and
of
the
species
we
have
observed
how
solidarity
of
interest
is
the
law
of
human
progress
and
we
have
concluded
that
with
the
abolition
of
private
property
and
the
cessation
of
all
domination
of
man
over
man
there
would
be
no
reason
for
government
to
exist
therefore
it
ought
to
be
abolished
but
it
may
be
objected
if
the
principle
on
which
social
organization
is
now
founded
were
to
be
changed
and
solidarity
substituted
for
strife
common
property
for
private
property
the
government
also
would
change
its
nature
instead
of
being
the
protector
and
representative
of
the
interests
of
one
class
it
would
become
if
there
were
no
longer
any
classes
representative
of
all
society
its
mission
would
be
to
secure
and
regulate
social
in
the
interests
of
all
and
to
fulfil
public
services
of
general
utility
it
would
defend
society
against
possible
attempts
to
privilege
and
prevent
or
repress
all
attacks
by
whomsoever
set
on
foot
against
the
life
or
liberty
of
each
there
are
in
society
certain
matters
too
important
requiring
too
much
constant
regular
attention
for
them
to
be
left
to
the
voluntary
management
of
individuals
without
danger
of
everything
getting
into
disorder
if
there
were
no
government
who
would
organize
the
supply
and
distribution
of
provisions
who
regulate
matters
pertaining
to
public
hygiene
the
postal
telegraph
and
railway
services
who
would
direct
public
instruction
who
undertake
those
great
works
of
exploration
improvement
on
a
large
scale
scientific
enterprise
which
transform
the
face
of
the
earth
and
augment
a
hundredfold
the
power
of
man
who
would
care
for
the
preservation
and
increase
of
capital
that
it
might
be
transmitted
to
posterity
enriched
and
improved
who
would
prevent
the
destruction
of
the
forests
or
the
irrational
exploitation
and
therefore
impoverishment
of
the
soil
who
would
there
be
to
prevent
and
repress
crimes
that
is
acts
what
of
those
who
disregarding
the
law
of
solidarity
would
not
work
or
of
those
who
might
spread
infectious
disease
in
a
country
by
refusing
to
submit
to
the
regulation
of
hygiene
by
science
or
what
again
could
be
done
with
those
who
whether
insane
or
no
might
set
fire
to
the
harvest
injure
children
or
abuse
and
take
advantage
of
the
weak
to
destroy
private
property
and
abolish
existing
government
without
reconstituting
a
government
that
would
organize
collective
life
and
secure
social
solidarity
would
not
be
to
abolish
privilege
and
bring
peace
and
prosperity
upon
earth
it
would
be
to
destroy
every
social
bond
to
leave
humanity
to
fall
back
into
barbarism
to
begin
again
the
reign
of
each
for
himself
which
would
establish
the
triumph
firstly
of
brute
force
and
secondly
of
economic
privilege
such
are
the
objections
brought
forward
by
authoritarians
even
by
those
who
are
socialists
that
is
who
wish
to
abolish
private
property
and
class
government
founded
upon
the
system
of
private
property
we
reply
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
true
that
with
a
change
of
social
conditions
the
nature
of
the
government
and
its
functions
would
also
change
organs
and
functions
are
inseparable
terms
take
from
an
organ
its
function
and
either
the
organ
will
die
or
the
function
will
reinstate
itself
place
an
army
in
a
country
where
there
is
no
reason
for
or
fear
of
foreign
war
and
this
army
will
provoke
war
or
if
it
do
not
succeed
in
doing
that
it
will
disband
a
police
force
where
there
are
no
crimes
to
discover
and
delinquents
to
arrest
will
provoke
or
invent
crimes
or
will
cease
to
exist
for
centuries
there
existed
in
france
an
institution
now
included
in
the
administration
of
the
forests
for
the
extermination
of
the
wolves
and
other
noxious
beasts
no
one
will
be
surprised
to
learn
that
just
on
account
of
this
institution
wolves
still
exist
in
france
and
that
in
rigorous
seasons
they
do
great
damage
the
public
take
little
heed
of
the
wolves
because
there
are
the
appointed
officials
whose
duty
it
is
to
think
about
them
and
the
officials
do
hunt
them
but
in
an
manner
sparing
their
caves
and
allowing
time
for
reproduction
that
they
may
not
run
the
risk
of
entirely
destroying
such
an
species
the
french
peasants
have
indeed
little
confidence
in
these
official
and
regard
them
rather
as
the
and
of
course
what
would
these
officials
do
if
there
were
no
longer
any
wolves
to
exterminate
a
government
that
is
a
number
of
persons
deputed
to
make
the
laws
and
entitled
to
use
the
collective
forces
of
society
to
make
every
individual
to
respect
these
laws
already
constitutes
a
class
privileged
and
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
community
such
a
class
like
every
elected
body
will
seek
instinctively
to
enlarge
its
powers
to
place
itself
above
the
control
of
the
people
to
impose
its
tendencies
and
to
make
its
own
interests
predominate
placed
in
a
privileged
position
the
government
always
finds
itself
in
antagonism
to
the
masses
of
whose
force
it
disposes
furthermore
a
government
with
the
best
intention
could
never
satisfy
everybody
even
if
it
succeeded
in
satisfying
some
it
must
therefore
always
be
defending
itself
against
the
discontented
and
for
that
reason
must
ally
itself
with
the
satisfied
section
of
the
community
for
necessary
support
and
in
this
manner
will
arise
again
the
old
story
of
a
privileged
class
which
can
not
help
but
be
developed
in
conjunction
with
the
government
this
class
if
it
could
not
again
acquire
possession
of
the
soil
would
certainly
monopolize
the
most
favored
spots
and
would
not
be
in
the
end
less
oppressive
or
less
an
instrument
of
exploitation
than
the
capitalist
class
the
governors
accustomed
to
command
would
never
wish
to
mix
with
the
common
crowd
if
they
could
not
retain
the
power
in
their
own
hands
they
would
at
least
secure
to
themselves
privileged
positions
for
the
time
when
they
would
be
out
of
office
they
would
use
all
the
means
they
have
in
their
power
to
get
their
own
friends
elected
as
their
successors
who
would
in
their
turn
be
supported
and
protected
by
their
predecessors
and
thus
the
government
would
pass
and
repass
into
the
same
hands
and
the
that
is
the
government
presumably
of
the
whole
people
would
end
as
it
always
has
done
in
becoming
an
or
the
government
of
a
few
the
government
of
a
class
and
this
oppressive
oligarchy
would
have
always
in
its
care
that
is
at
its
disposition
every
bit
of
social
capital
all
public
services
from
the
production
and
distribution
of
provisions
to
the
manufacture
of
matches
from
the
control
of
the
university
to
that
of
the
music
hall
but
let
us
even
suppose
that
the
government
did
not
necessarily
constitute
a
privileged
class
and
could
exist
without
forming
around
itself
a
new
privileged
class
let
us
imagine
that
it
could
remain
truly
representative
the
servant
if
you
will
of
all
society
what
purpose
would
it
then
serve
in
what
particular
and
in
what
manner
would
it
augment
the
power
intelligence
spirit
of
solidarity
care
of
the
general
welfare
present
and
to
come
that
at
any
given
moment
existed
in
a
given
society
it
is
always
the
old
story
of
the
man
with
bound
limbs
who
having
managed
to
live
in
spite
of
his
bands
believes
that
he
lives
by
means
of
them
we
are
accustomed
to
live
under
a
government
which
makes
use
of
all
that
energy
that
intelligence
and
that
will
which
it
can
direct
to
its
own
ends
but
which
hinders
paralyzes
and
suppresses
those
that
are
useless
or
hostile
to
it
and
we
imagine
that
all
that
is
done
in
society
is
done
by
virtue
of
the
government
and
that
without
the
government
there
would
be
neither
energy
intelligence
nor
good
will
in
society
so
it
happens
as
we
have
already
said
that
the
proprietor
who
has
possessed
himself
of
the
soil
has
it
cultivated
for
his
own
particular
profit
leaving
the
laborer
the
barest
necessities
of
life
for
which
he
can
and
will
continue
to
labor
while
the
enslaved
laborer
thinks
that
he
could
not
live
without
his
master
as
though
it
were
who
created
the
earth
and
the
forces
of
nature
what
can
government
of
itself
add
to
the
moral
and
material
forces
which
exist
in
a
society
unless
it
be
like
the
god
of
the
bible
who
created
the
universe
out
of
nothing
as
nothing
is
created
in
the
material
world
so
in
this
more
complicated
form
of
the
material
world
which
is
the
social
world
nothing
can
be
created
and
therefore
governors
can
dispose
of
no
other
force
than
that
which
is
already
in
society
and
indeed
not
by
any
means
of
all
of
that
as
much
force
is
necessarily
paralyzed
and
destroyed
by
governmental
methods
of
action
while
more
again
is
wasted
in
the
friction
with
rebellious
elements
inevitably
great
in
such
an
artificial
mechanism
whenever
governors
originate
anything
of
themselves
it
is
as
men
and
not
as
governors
that
they
do
so
and
of
that
amount
of
force
both
material
and
moral
which
does
remain
at
the
disposition
of
the
government
only
an
infinitesimally
small
part
achieves
an
end
really
useful
to
society
the
remainder
is
either
consumed
in
actively
repressing
rebellious
opposition
or
is
otherwise
diverted
from
the
aim
of
general
utility
and
turned
to
the
profit
of
the
few
and
to
the
injury
of
the
majority
of
men
so
much
has
been
made
of
the
part
that
individual
initiative
and
social
action
play
respectively
in
the
life
and
progress
of
human
society
and
such
is
the
confusion
of
metaphysical
language
that
those
who
affirm
that
individual
initiative
is
the
source
and
agency
of
all
action
seem
to
be
asserting
something
quite
preposterous
in
reality
it
is
a
truism
which
becomes
apparent
directly
we
begin
to
explain
the
actual
facts
represented
by
these
words
the
real
being
is
the
man
the
individual
society
or
the
collectivity
and
the
state
or
government
which
professes
to
represent
it
if
not
hollow
abstractions
can
be
nothing
else
than
aggregates
of
individuals
and
it
is
within
the
individual
organism
that
all
thoughts
and
all
human
action
necessarily
have
their
origin
originally
individual
they
become
collective
thoughts
and
actions
when
shared
in
common
by
many
individuals
social
action
then
is
not
the
negation
nor
the
complement
of
individual
initiative
but
it
is
the
sum
total
of
the
initiatives
thoughts
and
actions
of
all
the
individuals
composing
society
a
result
which
other
things
equal
is
more
or
less
great
according
as
the
individual
forces
tend
toward
the
same
aim
or
are
divergent
and
opposed
if
on
the
other
hand
as
the
authoritarians
make
out
by
social
action
is
meant
governmental
action
then
it
is
again
the
result
of
individual
forces
but
only
of
those
individuals
who
either
form
part
of
the
government
or
by
virtue
of
their
position
are
enabled
to
influence
the
conduct
of
the
government
thus
in
the
contest
of
centuries
between
liberty
and
authority
or
in
other
words
between
social
equality
and
social
castes
the
question
at
issue
has
not
really
been
the
relations
between
society
and
the
individual
nor
the
increase
of
individual
independence
at
the
cost
of
social
control
or
rather
it
has
had
to
do
with
preventing
any
one
individual
from
oppressing
the
others
with
giving
to
everyone
the
same
rights
and
the
same
means
of
action
it
has
had
to
do
with
substituting
the
initiative
of
all
which
must
naturally
result
in
the
advantage
of
all
for
the
initiative
of
the
few
which
necessarily
results
in
the
suppression
of
all
the
others
it
is
always
in
short
the
question
of
putting
an
end
to
the
domination
and
exploitation
of
man
by
man
in
such
a
way
that
all
are
interested
in
the
common
welfare
and
that
the
individual
force
of
each
instead
of
oppressing
combating
or
suppressing
others
will
find
the
possibility
of
complete
development
and
every
one
will
seek
to
associate
with
others
for
the
greater
advantage
of
all
from
what
we
have
said
it
follows
that
the
existence
of
a
government
even
upon
the
hypothesis
that
the
ideal
government
of
authoritarian
socialists
were
possible
far
from
producing
an
increase
of
productive
force
would
immensely
diminish
it
because
the
government
would
restrict
initiative
to
the
few
it
would
give
these
few
the
right
to
do
all
things
without
being
able
of
course
to
endow
them
with
the
knowledge
or
understanding
of
all
things
in
fact
if
you
divest
legislation
and
all
the
operations
of
government
of
what
is
intended
to
protect
the
privileged
and
what
represents
the
wishes
of
the
privileged
classes
alone
nothing
remains
but
the
aggregate
of
individual
governors
the
state
says
sismondi
is
always
a
conservative
power
that
authorizes
regulates
and
organizes
the
conquests
of
progress
and
history
testifies
that
it
applies
them
to
the
profit
of
its
own
and
the
other
privileged
classes
but
never
does
inaugurate
them
new
ideas
always
originate
from
beneath
are
conceived
in
the
foundations
of
society
and
then
when
divulged
they
become
opinion
and
grow
but
they
must
always
meet
on
their
path
and
combat
the
constituted
powers
of
tradition
custom
privilege
and
error
in
order
to
understand
how
society
could
exist
without
a
government
it
is
sufficient
to
turn
our
attention
for
a
short
space
to
what
actually
goes
on
in
our
present
society
we
shall
see
that
in
reality
the
most
important
social
functions
are
fulfilled
even
outside
the
intervention
of
government
also
that
government
only
interferes
to
exploit
the
masses
or
defend
the
privileged
class
or
lastly
to
sanction
most
unnecessarily
all
that
has
been
done
without
its
aid
often
in
spite
of
and
in
opposition
to
it
men
work
exchange
study
travel
follow
as
they
choose
the
current
rules
of
morality
or
hygiene
they
profit
by
the
progress
of
science
and
art
have
numberless
mutual
interests
without
ever
feeling
the
need
of
anyone
to
direct
them
how
to
conduct
themselves
in
regard
to
these
matters
on
the
contrary
it
is
just
those
things
in
which
there
is
no
governmental
interference
that
prosper
best
and
that
give
rise
to
the
least
contention
being
unconsciously
adapted
to
the
wish
of
all
in
the
way
found
most
useful
and
agreeable
nor
is
government
more
necessary
in
the
case
of
large
undertakings
or
for
those
public
services
which
require
the
constant
of
many
people
of
different
conditions
and
countries
thousands
of
these
undertakings
are
even
now
the
work
of
voluntarily
formed
associations
and
these
are
by
the
acknowledgment
of
every
one
the
undertakings
which
succeed
the
best
nor
do
we
refer
to
the
association
of
capitalists
organized
by
means
of
exploitation
although
even
they
show
capabilities
and
powers
of
free
association
which
may
extend
until
it
embraces
all
the
peoples
of
all
lands
and
includes
the
widest
and
most
varying
interests
but
we
speak
rather
of
those
associations
inspired
by
the
love
of
humanity
or
by
the
passion
for
knowledge
or
even
simply
by
the
desire
for
amusement
and
love
of
applause
as
these
better
represent
such
grouping
as
will
exist
in
a
society
where
private
property
and
internal
strife
between
men
being
abolished
each
will
find
his
interests
synonymous
with
the
interests
of
every
one
else
and
his
greatest
satisfaction
in
doing
good
and
pleasing
others
scientific
societies
and
congresses
international
and
red
cross
associations
laborers
unions
peace
societies
volunteers
who
hasten
to
the
rescue
at
times
of
great
public
calamity
are
all
examples
among
thousands
of
that
power
of
the
spirit
of
association
which
always
shows
itself
when
a
need
arises
or
an
enthusiasm
takes
hold
and
the
means
do
not
fail
that
voluntary
associations
do
not
cover
the
world
and
do
not
embrace
every
branch
of
material
and
moral
activity
is
the
fault
of
the
obstacles
placed
in
their
way
by
governments
of
the
antagonisms
created
by
the
possession
of
private
property
and
of
the
impotence
and
degradation
to
which
the
monopolizing
of
wealth
on
the
part
of
the
few
reduces
the
majority
of
mankind
the
government
takes
charge
for
instance
of
the
postal
and
telegraphic
services
but
in
what
way
does
it
really
assist
them
when
the
people
are
in
such
a
condition
as
to
be
able
to
enjoy
and
feel
the
need
of
such
services
they
will
think
about
organizing
them
and
the
man
with
the
necessary
technical
knowledge
will
not
require
a
certificate
from
the
government
to
enable
him
to
set
to
work
the
more
general
and
urgent
the
need
the
more
volunteers
will
offer
to
satisfy
it
would
the
people
have
the
ability
necessary
to
provide
and
distribute
provisions
oh
never
fear
they
will
not
die
of
hunger
waiting
for
a
government
to
pass
laws
on
the
subject
wherever
a
government
exists
it
must
wait
until
the
people
have
first
organized
everything
and
then
come
with
its
laws
to
sanction
and
exploit
that
which
has
been
already
done
it
is
evident
that
private
interest
is
the
great
motive
for
all
activity
that
being
so
when
the
interest
of
every
one
becomes
the
interest
of
each
and
it
necessarily
will
become
so
as
soon
as
private
property
is
abolished
then
all
will
be
active
and
if
now
they
work
in
the
interest
of
the
few
so
much
the
more
and
so
much
the
better
will
they
work
to
satisfy
the
interests
of
all
it
is
hard
to
understand
how
anyone
can
believe
that
public
services
indispensable
to
social
life
can
be
better
secured
by
order
of
a
government
than
through
the
workers
themselves
who
by
their
own
choice
or
by
agreement
made
with
others
carry
them
out
under
the
immediate
control
of
all
interested
certainly
in
every
collective
undertaking
on
a
large
scale
there
is
need
for
division
of
labor
for
technical
direction
administration
etc
but
the
authoritarians
are
merely
playing
with
words
when
they
deduce
a
reason
for
the
existence
of
government
from
the
very
real
necessity
for
organization
of
labor
the
government
we
must
repeat
is
the
aggregate
of
the
individuals
who
have
had
given
them
or
have
taken
the
right
or
the
means
to
make
laws
and
force
the
people
to
obey
them
the
administrators
engineers
on
the
other
hand
are
men
who
receive
or
assume
the
charge
of
doing
a
certain
work
and
who
do
it
government
signifies
delegation
of
power
that
is
abdication
of
the
initiative
and
sovereignty
of
every
one
into
the
hands
of
the
few
administration
signifies
delegation
of
work
that
is
a
charge
given
and
accepted
the
free
exchange
of
services
founded
on
free
agreement
a
governor
is
a
privileged
person
because
he
has
the
right
to
command
others
and
to
avail
himself
of
the
force
of
others
to
make
his
own
ideas
and
desires
triumph
an
administrator
or
technical
director
is
a
worker
like
others
in
a
society
of
course
where
all
have
equal
opportunities
of
development
and
all
are
or
can
be
at
the
same
time
intellectual
and
manual
workers
when
there
are
no
other
differences
between
men
than
those
derived
from
diversity
of
talents
and
all
work
and
all
social
functions
give
an
equal
right
to
the
enjoyment
of
social
advantages
the
functions
of
government
are
in
short
not
to
be
confounded
with
administrative
functions
as
they
are
essentially
different
that
they
are
today
so
often
confused
is
entirely
on
account
of
the
existence
of
economic
and
political
privilege
but
let
us
hasten
to
pass
on
to
those
functions
for
which
government
is
thought
indispensable
by
all
who
are
not
anarchists
these
are
the
internal
and
external
defence
of
society
that
is
war
police
and
justice
government
being
abolished
and
social
wealth
at
the
disposal
of
every
one
all
antagonism
between
various
nations
would
soon
cease
and
there
would
consequently
be
no
more
cause
for
war
moreover
in
the
present
state
of
the
world
in
any
country
where
the
spirit
of
rebellion
is
growing
even
if
it
do
not
find
an
echo
throughout
the
land
it
will
be
certain
of
so
much
sympathy
that
the
government
will
not
dare
to
send
all
its
troops
to
a
foreign
war
for
fear
the
revolution
should
break
out
at
home
but
even
supposing
that
the
rulers
of
countries
not
yet
emancipated
would
wish
and
could
attempt
to
reduce
a
free
people
to
servitude
would
these
require
a
government
to
enable
them
to
defend
themselves
to
make
war
we
need
men
who
have
the
necessary
geographical
and
technical
knowledge
and
above
all
people
willing
to
fight
a
government
has
no
means
of
augmenting
the
ability
of
the
former
or
the
willingness
or
courage
of
the
latter
and
the
experience
of
history
teaches
that
a
people
really
desirous
of
defending
their
own
country
are
invincible
in
italy
every
one
knows
how
thrones
tremble
and
regular
armies
of
hired
soldiers
vanish
before
troops
of
volunteers
that
is
armies
anarchically
formed
and
as
to
the
police
and
justice
many
imagine
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
police
and
the
judges
everybody
would
be
free
to
kill
violate
or
injure
others
as
the
humor
took
him
that
anarchists
if
they
are
true
to
their
principles
would
like
to
see
this
strange
kind
of
liberty
respected
liberty
that
violates
or
destroys
the
life
and
freedom
of
others
unrestrained
such
people
believe
that
we
having
overthrown
the
government
and
private
property
shall
then
tranquilly
allow
the
of
both
out
of
respect
for
the
liberty
of
those
who
may
feel
the
need
of
having
a
government
and
private
property
a
strange
mode
indeed
of
construing
our
ideas
in
truth
one
may
better
answer
such
notions
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
than
by
taking
the
trouble
to
confute
them
the
liberty
we
wish
for
for
ourselves
and
others
is
not
an
absolute
abstract
metaphysical
liberty
which
in
practice
can
only
amount
to
the
oppression
of
the
weak
but
we
wish
for
a
tangible
liberty
the
possible
liberty
which
is
the
conscious
communion
of
interests
that
is
voluntary
solidarity
we
proclaim
the
maxim
as
you
will
and
in
this
our
program
is
almost
entirely
contained
because
as
may
be
easily
understood
we
hold
that
in
a
society
without
government
or
property
each
one
wish
that
which
he
but
if
in
consequence
of
a
false
education
received
in
the
present
society
or
of
physical
disease
or
whatever
other
cause
an
individual
should
wish
to
injure
others
you
may
be
sure
we
should
adopt
all
the
means
in
our
power
to
prevent
him
as
we
know
that
a
man
character
is
the
consequence
of
his
physical
organism
and
of
the
cosmic
and
social
influences
surrounding
him
we
certainly
shall
not
confound
the
sacred
right
of
with
the
absurdly
assumed
right
to
punish
also
we
shall
not
regard
the
delinquent
that
is
the
man
who
commits
acts
as
the
rebel
he
seems
in
the
eyes
of
the
judges
nowadays
we
shall
regard
him
as
a
sick
brother
in
need
of
cure
we
therefore
shall
not
act
towards
him
in
the
spirit
of
hatred
when
repressing
him
but
shall
confine
ourselves
solely
to
we
shall
not
seek
to
revenge
ourselves
but
rather
to
rescue
the
unfortunate
one
by
every
means
that
science
suggests
in
theory
anarchists
may
go
astray
like
others
losing
sight
of
the
reality
under
a
semblance
of
logic
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
emancipated
people
will
not
let
their
dearly
bought
liberty
and
welfare
be
attacked
with
impunity
if
the
necessity
arose
they
would
provide
for
their
own
defence
against
the
tendencies
of
certain
amongst
them
but
how
do
those
whose
business
it
now
is
to
make
the
laws
protect
society
or
those
others
who
live
by
seeking
for
and
inventing
new
infringements
of
law
even
now
when
the
masses
of
the
people
really
disapprove
of
anything
and
think
it
injurious
they
always
find
a
way
to
prevent
it
very
much
more
effectually
than
all
the
professional
legislators
constables
or
judges
during
insurrections
the
people
though
very
mistakenly
have
enforced
the
respect
for
private
property
and
they
have
secured
this
respect
far
better
than
an
army
of
policemen
could
have
done
customs
always
follow
the
needs
and
sentiments
of
the
majority
and
they
are
always
the
more
respected
the
less
they
are
subject
to
the
sanction
of
law
this
is
because
every
one
sees
and
comprehends
their
utility
and
because
the
interested
parties
not
deluding
themselves
with
the
idea
that
government
will
protect
them
are
themselves
concerned
in
seeing
the
custom
respected
the
economical
use
of
water
is
of
very
great
importance
to
a
caravan
crossing
the
deserts
of
africa
under
these
circumstances
water
is
a
sacred
thing
and
no
sane
man
dreams
of
wasting
it
conspirators
are
obliged
to
act
secretly
so
secrecy
is
preserved
among
them
and
obloquy
rests
on
whosoever
violates
it
gambling
debts
are
not
guaranteed
by
law
but
among
gamblers
it
is
considered
dishonorable
not
to
pay
them
and
the
delinquent
feels
himself
dishonored
by
not
fulfilling
his
obligations
is
it
on
account
of
the
police
that
more
people
are
not
murdered
the
greater
part
of
the
italian
people
never
see
the
police
except
at
long
intervals
millions
of
men
go
over
the
mountains
and
through
the
country
far
from
the
protecting
eye
of
authority
where
they
might
be
attacked
without
the
slightest
fear
of
their
assailants
being
traced
but
they
run
no
greater
risk
than
those
who
live
in
the
best
guarded
spots
statistics
show
that
the
number
of
crimes
rise
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
repressive
measures
while
they
vary
rapidly
with
the
fluctuations
of
economic
conditions
and
with
the
state
of
public
opinion
preventive
laws
however
only
concern
unusual
exceptional
acts
life
goes
on
beyond
the
limits
of
the
criminal
code
and
is
regulated
almost
unconsciously
by
the
tacit
and
voluntary
assent
of
all
by
means
of
a
number
of
usages
and
customs
much
more
important
to
social
life
than
the
dictates
of
law
and
they
are
also
much
better
observed
although
completely
divested
of
any
sanction
beyond
the
natural
odium
which
falls
upon
those
who
violate
them
and
such
injury
as
this
odium
brings
with
it
when
disputes
arise
would
not
voluntarily
accepted
arbitration
or
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
be
far
more
likely
to
bring
about
a
just
settlement
of
the
difficulties
in
question
than
an
irresponsible
magistrate
who
has
the
right
to
pass
judgment
upon
everybody
and
everything
and
who
is
necessarily
incompetent
and
therefore
unjust
as
every
form
of
government
only
serves
to
protect
the
privileged
classes
so
do
police
and
judges
only
aim
at
repressing
those
crimes
often
not
considered
criminal
by
the
masses
which
offend
only
the
privileges
of
the
rulers
or
for
the
real
defence
of
society
the
defence
of
the
welfare
and
liberty
of
all
there
can
be
nothing
more
pernicious
than
the
formation
of
this
class
of
functionaries
who
exist
on
the
pretence
of
defending
all
and
therefore
habitually
regard
every
man
as
game
to
be
hunted
down
often
striking
at
the
command
of
a
superior
officer
without
themselves
even
knowing
why
like
hired
assassins
and
mercenaries
all
that
you
have
said
may
be
true
say
some
anarchy
may
be
a
perfect
form
of
social
life
but
we
have
no
desire
to
take
a
leap
in
the
dark
therefore
tell
us
how
your
society
will
be
organized
then
follows
a
long
string
of
questions
which
would
be
very
interesting
if
it
were
our
business
to
study
the
problems
that
might
arise
in
an
emancipated
society
but
of
which
it
is
useless
and
absurd
to
imagine
that
we
could
now
offer
a
definite
solution
according
to
what
method
will
children
be
taught
how
will
production
and
distribution
be
organized
will
there
still
be
large
cities
or
will
people
spread
equally
over
all
the
surface
of
the
earth
will
all
the
inhabitants
of
siberia
winter
at
nice
will
every
one
dine
on
partridges
and
drink
champagne
who
will
be
the
miners
and
sailors
who
will
clear
the
drains
will
the
sick
be
nursed
at
home
or
in
hospitals
who
will
arrange
the
railway
what
will
happen
if
the
falls
ill
while
the
train
is
on
its
way
and
so
on
without
end
as
though
we
could
prophesy
all
the
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
future
time
or
could
in
the
name
of
anarchy
prescribe
for
the
coming
man
what
time
he
should
go
to
bed
and
on
what
days
he
should
cut
his
nails
indeed
if
our
readers
expect
from
us
an
answer
to
these
questions
or
even
to
those
among
them
really
serious
and
important
which
can
not
be
anything
more
than
our
own
private
opinion
at
this
present
hour
we
must
have
succeeded
badly
in
our
endeavor
to
explain
what
anarchy
is
we
are
no
more
prophets
than
other
men
and
should
we
pretend
to
give
an
official
solution
to
all
the
problems
that
will
arise
in
the
life
of
the
future
society
we
should
have
indeed
a
curious
idea
of
the
abolition
of
government
we
should
then
be
describing
a
government
dictating
like
the
clergy
a
universal
code
for
the
present
and
all
future
time
seeing
that
we
have
neither
police
nor
prisons
to
enforce
our
doctrine
humanity
might
laugh
with
impunity
at
us
and
our
pretensions
nevertheless
we
consider
seriously
all
the
problems
of
social
life
which
now
suggest
themselves
on
account
of
their
scientific
interest
and
because
hoping
to
see
anarchy
realized
we
wish
to
help
towards
the
organization
of
the
new
society
we
have
therefore
our
own
ideas
on
these
subjects
ideas
which
are
to
our
minds
likely
to
be
permanent
or
transitory
according
to
the
respective
cases
and
did
space
permit
we
might
add
somewhat
more
on
these
points
but
the
fact
that
we
today
think
in
a
certain
way
on
a
given
question
is
no
proof
that
such
will
be
the
mode
of
procedure
in
the
future
who
can
foresee
the
activities
which
may
develop
in
humanity
when
it
is
emancipated
from
misery
and
oppression
when
all
have
the
means
of
instruction
and
when
the
strife
between
men
with
the
hatred
and
rancour
it
breeds
will
be
no
longer
a
necessary
condition
of
existence
who
can
foresee
the
progress
of
science
the
new
sources
of
production
means
of
communication
the
one
essential
is
that
a
society
be
constituted
in
which
the
exploitation
and
domination
of
man
by
man
are
impossible
that
the
society
in
other
words
be
such
that
the
means
of
existence
and
development
of
labor
be
free
and
open
to
every
one
and
all
be
able
to
according
to
their
wishes
and
their
knowledge
in
the
organization
of
social
life
under
such
conditions
everything
will
necessarily
be
performed
in
compliance
with
the
needs
of
all
according
to
the
knowledge
and
possibilities
of
the
moment
and
everything
will
improve
with
the
increase
of
knowledge
and
power
in
fact
a
program
which
would
touch
the
basis
of
the
new
social
constitution
could
not
do
more
after
all
than
indicate
a
method
and
method
more
than
anything
else
defines
parties
and
determines
their
importance
in
history
method
apart
every
one
says
he
wishes
for
the
good
of
mankind
and
many
do
truly
wish
for
it
as
parties
disappear
every
organized
action
directed
to
a
definite
end
disappears
likewise
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
consider
anarchy
as
above
all
a
method
there
are
two
methods
by
which
the
different
parties
not
anarchistic
expect
or
say
they
expect
to
bring
about
the
greatest
good
of
each
and
all
these
are
the
authoritarian
or
state
socialist
and
the
individualist
methods
the
former
entrusts
the
direction
of
social
life
to
a
few
and
it
would
result
in
the
exploitation
and
oppression
of
the
masses
by
that
few
the
second
party
trusts
to
the
free
initiative
of
individuals
and
proclaims
if
not
the
abolition
the
reduction
of
government
however
as
it
respects
private
property
and
is
founded
on
the
principle
of
each
for
himself
and
therefore
on
competition
its
liberty
is
only
the
liberty
of
the
strong
the
license
of
those
who
have
to
oppress
and
exploit
the
weak
who
have
nothing
far
from
producing
harmony
it
would
tend
always
to
augment
the
distance
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
and
end
also
through
exploitation
and
domination
in
authority
this
second
method
individualism
is
in
theory
a
kind
of
anarchy
without
socialism
it
is
therefore
no
better
than
a
lie
because
liberty
is
not
possible
without
equality
and
true
anarchy
can
not
be
without
solidarity
without
socialism
the
criticism
which
individualists
pass
on
government
is
merely
the
wish
to
deprive
it
of
certain
functions
to
virtually
hand
them
over
to
the
capitalist
but
it
can
not
attack
those
repressive
functions
which
form
the
essence
of
government
for
without
an
armed
force
the
proprietary
system
could
not
be
upheld
nay
even
more
under
individualism
the
repressive
power
of
government
must
always
increase
in
proportion
to
the
increase
by
means
of
free
competition
of
the
want
of
equality
and
harmony
anarchists
present
a
new
method
the
free
initiative
of
all
and
free
agreement
then
after
the
revolutionary
abolition
of
private
property
every
one
will
have
equal
power
to
dispose
of
social
wealth
this
method
not
admitting
the
of
private
property
must
lead
by
means
of
free
association
to
the
complete
triumph
of
the
principles
of
solidarity
thus
we
see
that
all
the
problems
put
forward
to
combat
the
anarchistic
idea
are
on
the
contrary
arguments
in
favor
of
anarchy
because
it
alone
indicates
the
way
in
which
by
experience
those
solutions
which
correspond
to
the
dicta
of
science
and
to
the
needs
and
wishes
of
all
can
best
be
found
how
will
children
be
educated
we
do
not
know
what
then
the
parents
teachers
and
all
who
are
interested
in
the
progress
of
the
rising
generation
will
meet
discuss
agree
and
differ
and
then
divide
according
to
their
various
opinions
putting
into
practice
the
methods
which
they
respectively
hold
to
be
best
that
method
which
when
tried
produces
the
best
results
will
triumph
in
the
end
and
so
for
all
the
problems
that
may
arise
according
to
what
we
have
so
far
said
it
is
evident
that
anarchy
as
the
anarchists
conceive
it
and
as
alone
it
can
be
comprehended
is
based
on
socialism
furthermore
were
it
not
for
that
school
of
socialists
who
artificially
divide
the
natural
unity
of
the
social
question
considering
only
some
detached
points
and
were
it
not
also
for
the
equivocations
with
which
they
strive
to
hinder
the
social
revolution
we
might
say
right
away
that
anarchy
is
synonymous
with
socialism
because
both
signify
the
abolition
of
exploitation
and
of
the
domination
of
man
over
man
whether
maintained
by
the
force
of
arms
or
by
the
monopolization
of
the
means
of
life
anarchy
like
socialism
has
for
its
basis
and
necessary
point
of
departure
of
its
aim
is
and
its
method
it
is
not
perfection
nor
is
it
the
absolute
ideal
which
like
the
horizon
always
recedes
as
we
advance
towards
it
but
it
is
the
open
road
to
all
progress
and
to
all
improvement
made
in
the
interest
of
all
humanity
there
are
authoritarians
who
grant
that
anarchy
is
the
mode
of
social
life
which
alone
opens
the
way
to
the
attainment
of
the
highest
possible
good
for
mankind
because
it
alone
can
put
an
end
to
every
class
interested
in
keeping
the
masses
oppressed
and
miserable
they
also
grant
that
anarchy
is
possible
because
it
does
nothing
more
than
release
humanity
from
an
obstacle
government
against
which
it
has
always
had
to
fight
its
painful
way
towards
progress
nevertheless
these
authoritarians
reinforced
by
many
warm
lovers
of
liberty
and
justice
in
theory
retire
into
their
last
entrenchments
because
they
are
afraid
of
liberty
and
can
not
be
persuaded
that
mankind
could
live
and
prosper
without
teachers
and
pastors
still
hard
pressed
by
the
truth
they
pitifully
demand
to
have
the
reign
of
liberty
put
off
for
a
while
indeed
for
as
long
as
possible
such
is
the
substance
of
the
arguments
that
meet
us
at
this
stage
a
society
without
a
government
which
would
act
by
free
voluntary
trusting
entirely
to
the
spontaneous
action
of
those
interested
and
founded
altogether
on
solidarity
and
sympathy
is
certainly
they
say
a
very
beautiful
ideal
but
like
all
ideals
it
is
a
castle
in
the
air
we
find
ourselves
placed
in
a
human
society
which
has
always
been
divided
into
oppressors
and
oppressed
and
if
the
former
are
full
of
the
spirit
of
domination
and
have
all
the
vices
of
tyrants
the
latter
are
corrupted
by
servility
and
have
those
still
worse
vices
which
are
the
result
of
enslavement
the
sentiment
of
solidarity
is
far
from
being
dominant
in
man
at
the
present
day
and
if
it
is
true
that
the
different
classes
of
men
are
becoming
more
and
more
unanimous
among
themselves
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
that
which
is
most
conspicuous
and
impresses
itself
most
on
human
character
today
is
the
struggle
for
existence
it
is
a
fact
that
each
fights
daily
against
every
one
else
and
competition
presses
upon
all
workmen
and
masters
causing
every
man
to
become
a
wolf
towards
every
other
man
how
can
these
men
educated
in
a
society
based
upon
antagonism
between
individuals
as
well
as
classes
be
transformed
in
a
moment
and
become
capable
of
living
in
a
society
in
which
each
shall
do
as
he
likes
and
as
he
should
without
external
coercion
caring
for
the
good
of
others
simply
by
the
impulse
of
their
own
nature
and
with
what
heart
or
what
common
sense
can
you
trust
to
a
revolution
on
the
part
of
an
ignorant
turbulent
mass
weakened
by
misery
stupefied
by
priestcraft
who
are
today
blindly
sanguinary
and
tomorrow
will
let
themselves
be
humbugged
by
any
knave
who
dares
to
call
himself
their
master
would
it
not
be
more
prudent
to
advance
gradually
towards
the
anarchistic
ideal
passing
through
republican
democratic
and
socialistic
stages
will
not
an
educative
government
composed
of
the
best
men
be
necessary
to
prepare
the
advancing
generations
for
their
future
destiny
these
objections
also
ought
not
to
appear
valid
if
we
have
succeeded
in
making
our
readers
understand
what
we
have
already
said
and
in
convincing
them
of
it
but
in
any
case
even
at
the
risk
of
repetition
it
may
be
as
well
to
answer
them
we
find
ourselves
continually
met
by
the
false
notion
that
government
is
in
itself
a
new
force
sprung
up
one
knows
not
whence
which
of
itself
adds
something
to
the
sum
of
the
force
and
capability
of
those
whom
it
is
composed
and
of
those
who
obey
it
while
on
the
contrary
all
that
is
done
is
done
by
individual
men
the
government
as
a
government
adds
nothing
save
the
tendency
to
monopolize
for
the
advantage
of
certain
parties
or
classes
and
to
repress
all
initiative
from
beyond
its
own
circle
to
abolish
authority
or
government
does
not
mean
to
destroy
the
individual
or
collective
forces
which
are
at
work
in
society
nor
the
influence
men
exert
over
one
another
that
would
be
to
reduce
humanity
to
an
aggregate
of
inert
and
separate
atoms
an
impossibility
which
if
it
could
be
performed
would
be
the
destruction
of
any
society
the
death
blow
to
mankind
to
abolish
authority
means
to
abolish
the
monopoly
of
force
and
of
influence
it
means
to
abolish
that
state
of
things
by
which
social
force
that
is
the
collective
force
of
all
in
a
society
is
made
the
instrument
of
the
thought
will
and
interests
of
a
small
number
of
individuals
these
by
means
of
the
collective
force
suppress
the
liberty
of
every
one
else
to
the
advantage
of
their
own
ideas
in
other
words
it
means
to
destroy
a
mode
of
organization
by
means
of
which
the
future
is
exploited
between
one
revolution
and
another
to
the
profit
of
those
who
have
been
the
victors
of
the
moment
michael
bakunin
in
an
article
published
in
asserts
that
the
great
means
of
action
of
the
international
were
the
propagating
of
their
ideas
and
the
organization
of
the
spontaneous
action
of
its
members
in
regard
to
the
masses
he
then
adds
to
whoever
might
pretend
that
action
so
organized
would
be
an
outrage
on
the
liberty
of
the
masses
or
an
attempt
to
create
a
new
authoritative
power
we
would
reply
that
he
is
a
sophist
and
a
fool
so
much
the
worse
for
those
who
ignore
the
natural
social
law
of
human
solidarity
to
the
extent
of
imagining
that
an
absolute
mutual
independence
of
individuals
and
of
masses
is
a
possible
or
even
desirable
thing
to
desire
it
would
be
to
wish
for
the
destruction
of
society
for
all
social
life
is
nothing
else
than
this
mutual
and
incessant
interdependence
among
individuals
and
masses
all
individuals
even
the
most
gifted
and
strongest
indeed
most
of
all
the
most
gifted
and
strongest
are
at
every
moment
of
their
lives
at
the
same
time
producers
and
products
equal
liberty
for
every
individual
is
only
the
resultant
continually
reproduced
of
this
mass
of
material
intellectual
and
moral
influence
exercised
on
him
by
all
the
individuals
around
him
belonging
to
the
society
in
which
he
was
born
has
developed
and
dies
to
wish
to
escape
this
influence
in
the
name
of
a
transcendental
liberty
divine
absolutely
egoistic
and
sufficient
to
itself
is
the
tendency
to
annihilation
to
refrain
from
influencing
others
would
mean
to
refrain
from
all
social
action
indeed
to
abstain
from
all
expression
of
thoughts
and
sentiments
and
simply
to
become
this
independence
so
much
extolled
by
idealists
and
metaphysicians
individual
liberty
conceived
in
this
sense
would
amount
to
in
nature
as
in
human
society
which
is
also
a
part
of
this
same
nature
all
that
exists
lives
only
by
complying
with
the
supreme
conditions
of
interaction
which
is
more
or
less
positive
and
potent
with
regard
to
the
lives
of
other
beings
according
to
the
nature
of
the
individual
and
when
we
vindicate
the
liberty
of
the
masses
we
do
not
pretend
to
abolish
anything
of
the
natural
influences
that
individuals
or
groups
of
individuals
exert
upon
one
another
what
we
wish
for
is
the
abolition
of
artificial
influences
which
are
privileged
legal
and
official
certainly
in
the
present
state
of
mankind
oppressed
by
misery
stupefied
by
superstition
and
sunk
in
degradation
the
human
lot
depends
upon
a
relatively
small
number
of
individuals
of
course
all
men
will
not
be
able
to
rise
in
a
moment
to
the
height
of
perceiving
their
duty
or
even
the
enjoyment
of
so
regulating
their
own
action
that
others
also
will
derive
the
greatest
possible
benefit
from
it
but
because
nowadays
the
thoughtful
and
guiding
forces
at
work
in
society
are
few
that
is
no
reason
for
paralyzing
them
still
more
and
for
the
subjection
of
many
individuals
to
the
direction
of
a
few
it
is
no
reason
for
constituting
society
in
such
a
manner
that
the
most
active
forces
the
highest
capacities
are
in
the
end
found
outside
the
government
and
almost
deprived
of
influence
on
social
life
all
this
now
happens
owing
to
the
inertia
that
secured
positions
foster
to
heredity
to
protectionism
to
party
spirit
and
to
all
the
mechanism
of
government
for
those
in
government
office
taken
out
of
their
former
social
position
primarily
concerned
in
retaining
power
lose
all
power
to
act
spontaneously
and
become
only
an
obstacle
to
the
free
action
of
others
with
the
abolition
of
this
negative
potency
constituting
government
society
will
become
that
which
it
can
be
with
the
given
forces
and
capabilities
of
the
moment
if
there
are
educated
men
desirous
of
spreading
education
they
will
organize
the
schools
and
will
be
constrained
to
make
the
use
and
enjoyment
to
be
derived
from
education
felt
and
if
there
are
no
such
men
or
only
a
few
of
them
a
government
can
not
create
them
all
it
can
do
as
in
fact
it
does
nowadays
is
to
take
these
few
away
from
practical
fruitful
work
in
the
sphere
of
education
and
put
them
to
direct
from
above
what
has
to
be
imposed
by
the
help
of
a
police
system
so
they
make
out
of
intelligent
and
impassionate
teachers
mere
politicians
who
become
useless
parasites
entirely
absorbed
in
imposing
their
own
hobbies
and
in
maintaining
themselves
in
power
if
there
are
doctors
and
teachers
of
hygiene
they
will
organize
themselves
for
the
service
of
health
and
if
there
are
none
a
government
can
not
create
them
all
that
it
can
do
is
to
discredit
them
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
who
are
inclined
to
entertain
suspicions
sometimes
only
too
well
founded
with
regard
to
everything
which
is
imposed
upon
them
if
there
are
engineers
and
mechanics
they
will
organize
the
railways
etc
and
if
there
are
none
a
government
can
not
create
them
the
revolution
by
abolishing
government
and
private
property
will
not
create
force
which
does
not
exist
but
it
will
leave
a
free
field
for
the
exercise
of
all
available
force
and
of
all
existent
capacity
while
it
will
destroy
every
class
interested
in
keeping
the
masses
degraded
it
will
act
in
such
a
way
that
every
one
will
be
free
to
work
and
make
his
influence
felt
in
proportion
to
his
own
capacity
and
in
conformity
with
his
sentiments
and
interests
and
it
is
only
thus
that
the
elevation
of
the
masses
is
possible
for
it
is
only
with
liberty
that
one
can
learn
to
be
free
as
it
is
only
by
working
that
one
can
learn
to
work
a
government
even
had
it
no
other
advantages
must
always
have
that
of
habituating
the
governed
to
subjection
and
must
also
tend
to
become
more
oppressive
and
more
necessary
in
proportion
as
its
subjects
are
more
obedient
and
docile
but
suppose
government
were
the
direction
of
affairs
by
the
best
people
who
are
the
best
and
how
shall
we
recognize
their
superiority
the
majority
are
generally
attached
to
old
prejudices
and
have
ideas
and
instincts
already
outgrown
by
the
more
favored
minority
but
of
the
various
minorities
who
all
believe
themselves
in
the
right
as
no
doubt
many
of
them
are
in
part
which
shall
be
chosen
to
rule
and
by
whom
and
by
what
criterion
seeing
that
the
future
alone
can
prove
which
among
them
is
the
must
superior
if
you
choose
a
hundred
partisans
of
dictatorship
you
will
discover
that
each
one
of
the
hundred
believes
himself
capable
of
being
if
not
sole
dictator
at
least
of
assisting
very
materially
in
the
dictatorial
government
the
dictators
would
be
those
who
by
one
means
or
another
succeeded
in
imposing
themselves
on
society
and
in
course
of
time
all
their
energy
would
inevitably
be
employed
in
defending
themselves
against
the
attacks
of
their
adversaries
totally
oblivious
of
their
desire
if
ever
they
had
had
it
to
be
merely
an
educative
power
should
government
be
on
the
other
hand
elected
by
universal
suffrage
and
so
be
the
emanation
more
or
less
sincere
of
the
wish
of
the
majority
but
if
you
consider
these
worthy
electors
as
incapable
of
providing
for
their
own
interests
how
can
they
ever
be
capable
of
themselves
choosing
directors
to
guide
them
wisely
how
solve
this
problem
of
social
alchemy
to
elect
a
government
of
geniuses
by
the
votes
of
a
mass
of
fools
and
what
will
be
the
lot
of
the
minority
who
are
the
most
intelligent
most
active
and
most
advanced
in
society
to
solve
the
social
problem
to
the
advantage
of
all
there
is
only
one
way
to
expel
the
government
by
revolutionary
means
to
expropriate
the
holders
of
social
wealth
putting
everything
at
the
disposition
of
all
and
to
leave
all
existing
force
capacity
and
among
men
free
to
provide
for
the
needs
of
all
we
fight
for
anarchy
and
for
socialism
because
we
believe
that
anarchy
and
socialism
ought
to
be
brought
into
operation
as
soon
as
possible
which
means
that
the
revolution
must
drive
away
the
government
abolish
private
property
and
entrust
all
public
service
which
will
then
embrace
all
social
life
to
the
spontaneous
free
unofficial
and
unauthorized
operation
of
all
those
interested
and
all
those
willing
volunteers
there
will
certainly
be
difficulties
and
inconveniences
but
the
people
will
be
resolute
and
they
alone
can
solve
all
difficulties
anarchically
that
is
by
direct
action
of
those
interested
and
by
free
agreement
we
can
not
say
whether
anarchy
and
socialism
will
triumph
after
the
next
revolutionary
attempt
but
this
is
certain
that
if
any
of
the
transition
programs
triumph
it
will
be
because
we
have
been
temporarily
beaten
and
never
because
we
have
thought
it
wise
to
leave
in
existence
any
one
part
of
that
evil
system
under
which
humanity
groans
whatever
happens
we
shall
have
some
influence
on
events
by
our
numbers
our
energy
our
intelligence
and
our
steadfastness
also
even
if
we
are
now
conquered
our
work
will
not
have
been
in
vain
for
the
more
decided
we
shall
have
been
in
aiming
at
the
realization
of
all
our
demands
the
less
there
will
be
of
government
and
of
private
property
in
the
new
society
and
we
shall
have
done
a
great
work
for
human
progress
is
measured
by
the
degree
in
which
government
and
private
property
are
administered
if
today
we
fall
without
lowering
our
colors
our
cause
is
certain
of
victory
tomorrow
