respectful
gratitude
de
balzac
marcas
i
never
saw
anybody
not
even
among
the
most
remarkable
men
of
the
day
whose
appearance
was
so
striking
as
this
man
s
the
study
of
his
countenance
at
first
gave
me
a
feeling
of
great
melancholy
and
at
last
produced
an
almost
painful
impression
there
was
a
certain
harmony
between
the
man
and
his
name
the
preceding
marcas
which
was
seen
on
the
addresses
of
his
letters
and
which
he
never
omitted
from
his
signature
as
the
last
letter
of
the
alphabet
suggested
some
mysterious
fatality
marcas
say
this
name
again
and
again
do
you
not
feel
as
if
it
had
some
sinister
meaning
does
it
not
seem
to
you
that
its
owner
must
be
doomed
to
martyrdom
though
foreign
savage
the
name
has
a
right
to
be
handed
down
to
posterity
it
is
well
constructed
easily
pronounced
and
has
the
brevity
that
beseems
a
famous
name
is
it
not
pleasant
as
well
as
odd
but
does
it
not
sound
unfinished
i
will
not
take
it
upon
myself
to
assert
that
names
have
no
influence
on
the
destiny
of
men
there
is
a
certain
secret
and
inexplicable
concord
or
a
visible
discord
between
the
events
of
a
man
s
life
and
his
name
which
is
truly
surprising
often
some
remote
but
very
real
correlation
is
revealed
our
globe
is
round
everything
is
linked
to
everything
else
some
day
perhaps
we
shall
revert
to
the
occult
sciences
do
you
not
discern
in
that
letter
z
an
adverse
influence
does
it
not
prefigure
the
wayward
and
fantastic
progress
of
a
life
what
wind
blew
on
that
letter
which
whatever
language
we
find
it
in
begins
scarcely
fifty
words
marcas
name
was
zephirin
saint
zephirin
is
highly
venerated
in
brittany
and
marcas
was
a
breton
study
the
name
once
more
z
marcas
the
man
s
whole
life
lies
in
this
fantastic
juxtaposition
of
seven
letters
seven
the
most
significant
of
all
the
cabalistic
numbers
and
he
died
at
so
his
life
extended
over
seven
lustres
marcas
does
it
not
hint
of
some
precious
object
that
is
broken
with
a
fall
with
or
without
a
crash
i
had
finished
studying
the
law
in
paris
in
i
lived
at
that
time
in
the
rue
corneille
in
a
house
where
none
but
students
came
to
lodge
one
of
those
large
houses
where
there
is
a
winding
staircase
quite
at
the
back
lighted
below
from
the
street
higher
up
by
borrowed
lights
and
at
the
top
by
a
skylight
there
were
forty
furnished
rooms
furnished
as
students
rooms
are
what
does
youth
demand
more
than
was
here
supplied
a
bed
a
few
chairs
a
chest
of
drawers
a
and
a
table
as
soon
as
the
sky
is
blue
the
student
opens
his
window
but
in
this
street
there
are
no
fair
neighbors
to
flirt
with
in
front
is
the
odeon
long
since
closed
presenting
a
wall
that
is
beginning
to
go
black
its
tiny
gallery
windows
and
its
vast
expanse
of
slate
roof
i
was
not
rich
enough
to
have
a
good
room
i
was
not
even
rich
enough
to
have
a
room
to
myself
juste
and
i
shared
a
room
on
the
fifth
floor
on
our
side
of
the
landing
there
were
but
two
rooms
ours
and
a
smaller
one
occupied
by
marcas
our
neighbor
for
six
months
juste
and
i
remained
in
perfect
ignorance
of
the
fact
the
old
woman
who
managed
the
house
had
indeed
told
us
that
the
room
was
inhabited
but
she
had
added
that
we
should
not
be
disturbed
that
the
occupant
was
exceedingly
quiet
in
fact
for
those
six
months
we
never
met
our
and
we
never
heard
a
sound
in
his
room
in
spite
of
the
thinness
of
the
partition
that
divided
us
one
of
those
walls
of
lath
and
plaster
which
are
common
in
paris
houses
our
room
a
little
over
seven
feet
high
was
hung
with
a
vile
cheap
paper
sprigged
with
blue
the
floor
was
painted
and
knew
nothing
of
the
polish
given
by
the
brush
by
our
beds
there
was
only
a
scrap
of
thin
carpet
the
chimney
opened
immediately
to
the
roof
and
smoked
so
abominably
that
we
were
obliged
to
provide
a
stove
at
our
own
expense
our
beds
were
mere
painted
wooden
cribs
like
those
in
schools
on
the
chimney
shelf
there
were
but
two
brass
candlesticks
with
or
without
tallow
candles
in
them
and
our
two
pipes
with
some
tobacco
in
a
pouch
or
strewn
abroad
also
the
little
piles
of
left
there
by
our
visitors
or
ourselves
a
pair
of
calico
curtains
hung
from
the
brass
window
rods
and
on
each
side
of
the
window
was
a
small
bookcase
in
such
as
every
one
knows
who
has
stared
into
the
shop
windows
of
the
quartier
latin
and
in
which
we
kept
the
few
books
necessary
for
our
studies
the
ink
in
the
inkstand
was
always
in
the
state
of
lava
congealed
in
the
crater
of
a
volcano
may
not
any
inkstand
nowadays
become
a
vesuvius
the
pens
all
twisted
served
to
clean
the
stems
of
our
pipes
and
in
opposition
to
all
the
laws
of
credit
paper
was
even
scarcer
than
coin
how
can
young
men
be
expected
to
stay
at
home
in
such
furnished
lodgings
the
students
studied
in
the
cafes
the
theatre
the
luxembourg
gardens
in
rooms
even
in
the
law
schools
anywhere
rather
than
in
their
horrible
rooms
horrible
for
purposes
of
study
delightful
as
soon
as
they
were
used
for
gossiping
and
smoking
in
put
a
cloth
on
the
table
and
the
impromptu
dinner
sent
in
from
the
best
in
the
neighborhood
places
for
four
two
of
them
in
petticoats
show
a
lithograph
of
this
interior
to
the
veriest
bigot
and
she
will
be
bound
to
smile
we
thought
only
of
amusing
ourselves
the
reason
for
our
dissipation
lay
in
the
most
serious
facts
of
the
politics
of
the
time
juste
and
i
could
not
see
any
room
for
us
in
the
two
professions
our
parents
wished
us
to
take
up
there
are
a
hundred
doctors
a
hundred
lawyers
for
one
that
is
wanted
the
crowd
is
choking
these
two
paths
which
are
supposed
to
lead
to
fortune
but
which
are
merely
two
arenas
men
kill
each
other
there
fighting
not
indeed
with
swords
or
but
with
intrigue
and
calumny
with
tremendous
toil
campaigns
in
the
sphere
of
the
intellect
as
murderous
as
those
in
italy
were
to
the
soldiers
of
the
republic
in
these
days
when
everything
is
an
intellectual
competition
a
man
must
be
able
to
sit
hours
on
end
in
his
chair
before
a
table
as
a
general
could
remain
for
two
days
on
horseback
and
in
his
saddle
the
throng
of
aspirants
has
necessitated
a
division
of
the
faculty
of
medicine
into
categories
there
is
the
physician
who
writes
and
the
physician
who
practises
the
political
physician
and
the
physician
militant
four
different
ways
of
being
a
physician
four
classes
already
filled
up
as
to
the
fifth
class
that
of
physicians
who
sell
remedies
there
is
such
a
competition
that
they
fight
each
other
with
disgusting
advertisements
on
the
walls
of
paris
in
all
the
law
courts
there
are
almost
as
many
lawyers
as
there
are
cases
the
pleader
is
thrown
back
on
journalism
on
politics
on
literature
in
fact
the
state
besieged
for
the
smallest
appointments
under
the
law
has
ended
by
requiring
that
the
applicants
should
have
some
little
fortune
the
head
of
the
grocer
s
son
is
selected
in
preference
to
the
square
skull
of
a
man
of
talent
who
has
not
a
sou
work
as
he
will
with
all
his
energy
a
young
man
starting
from
zero
may
at
the
end
of
ten
years
find
himself
below
the
point
he
set
out
from
in
these
days
talent
must
have
the
good
luck
which
secures
success
to
the
most
incapable
nay
more
if
it
scorns
the
base
compromises
which
insure
advancement
to
crawling
mediocrity
it
will
never
get
on
if
we
thoroughly
knew
our
time
we
also
knew
ourselves
and
we
preferred
the
indolence
of
dreamers
to
aimless
stir
pleasure
to
the
useless
toil
which
would
have
exhausted
our
courage
and
worn
out
the
edge
of
our
intelligence
we
had
analyzed
social
life
while
smoking
laughing
and
loafing
but
though
elaborated
by
such
means
as
these
our
reflections
were
none
the
less
judicious
and
profound
while
we
were
fully
conscious
of
the
slavery
to
which
youth
is
condemned
we
were
amazed
at
the
brutal
indifference
of
the
authorities
to
everything
connected
with
intellect
thought
and
poetry
how
often
have
juste
and
i
exchanged
glances
when
reading
the
papers
as
we
studied
political
events
or
the
debates
in
the
chamber
and
discussed
the
proceedings
of
a
court
whose
wilful
ignorance
could
find
no
parallel
but
in
the
platitude
of
the
courtiers
the
mediocrity
of
the
men
forming
the
hedge
round
the
throne
all
alike
devoid
of
talent
or
breadth
of
view
of
distinction
or
learning
of
influence
or
dignity
could
there
be
a
higher
tribute
to
the
court
of
charles
than
the
present
court
if
court
it
may
be
called
what
a
hatred
of
the
country
may
be
seen
in
the
naturalization
of
vulgar
foreigners
devoid
of
talent
who
are
enthroned
in
the
chamber
of
peers
what
a
perversion
of
justice
what
an
insult
to
the
distinguished
youth
the
ambitions
native
to
the
soil
of
france
we
looked
upon
these
things
as
upon
a
spectacle
and
groaned
over
them
without
taking
upon
ourselves
to
act
juste
whom
no
one
ever
sought
and
who
never
sought
any
one
was
at
a
great
politician
a
man
with
a
wonderful
aptitude
for
apprehending
the
correlation
between
remote
history
and
the
facts
of
the
present
and
of
the
future
in
he
told
me
exactly
what
would
and
did
happen
the
murders
the
conspiracies
the
ascendency
of
the
jews
the
difficulty
of
doing
anything
in
france
the
scarcity
of
talent
in
the
higher
circles
and
the
abundance
of
intellect
in
the
lowest
ranks
where
the
finest
courage
is
smothered
under
cigar
ashes
what
was
to
become
of
him
his
parents
wished
him
to
be
a
doctor
but
if
he
were
a
doctor
must
he
not
wait
twenty
years
for
a
practice
you
know
what
he
did
no
well
he
is
a
doctor
but
he
left
france
he
is
in
asia
at
this
moment
he
is
perhaps
sinking
under
fatigue
in
a
desert
or
dying
of
the
lashes
of
a
barbarous
horde
or
perhaps
he
is
some
indian
prince
s
prime
minister
action
is
my
vocation
leaving
a
civil
college
at
the
age
of
twenty
the
only
way
for
me
to
enter
the
army
was
by
enlisting
as
a
common
soldier
so
weary
of
the
dismal
outlook
that
lay
before
a
lawyer
i
acquired
the
knowledge
needed
for
a
sailor
i
imitate
juste
and
keep
out
of
france
where
men
waste
in
the
struggle
to
make
way
the
energy
needed
for
the
noblest
works
follow
my
example
friends
i
am
going
where
a
man
steers
his
destiny
as
he
pleases
these
great
resolutions
were
formed
in
the
little
room
in
the
in
the
rue
corneille
in
spite
of
our
haunting
the
bal
musard
flirting
with
girls
of
the
town
and
leading
a
careless
and
apparently
reckless
life
our
plans
and
arguments
long
floated
in
the
air
marcas
our
neighbor
was
in
some
degree
the
guide
who
led
us
to
the
margin
of
the
precipice
or
the
torrent
who
made
us
sound
it
and
showed
us
beforehand
what
our
fate
would
be
if
we
let
ourselves
fall
into
it
it
was
he
who
put
us
on
our
guard
against
the
a
man
makes
with
poverty
under
the
sanction
of
hope
by
accepting
precarious
situations
whence
he
fights
the
battle
carried
along
by
the
devious
tide
of
paris
that
great
harlot
who
takes
you
up
or
leaves
you
stranded
smiles
or
turns
her
back
on
you
with
equal
readiness
wears
out
the
strongest
will
in
vexatious
waiting
and
makes
misfortune
wait
on
chance
at
our
first
meeting
marcas
as
it
were
dazzled
us
on
our
return
from
the
schools
a
little
before
the
we
were
accustomed
to
go
up
to
our
room
and
remain
there
a
while
either
waiting
for
the
other
to
learn
whether
there
were
any
change
in
our
plans
for
the
evening
one
day
at
four
o
clock
juste
met
marcas
on
the
stairs
and
i
saw
him
in
the
street
it
was
in
the
month
of
november
and
marcas
had
no
cloak
he
wore
shoes
with
heavy
soles
corduroy
trousers
and
a
blue
coat
buttoned
to
the
throat
which
gave
a
military
air
to
his
broad
chest
all
the
more
so
because
he
wore
a
black
stock
the
costume
was
not
in
itself
extraordinary
but
it
agreed
well
with
the
man
s
mien
and
countenance
my
first
impression
on
seeing
him
was
neither
surprise
nor
distress
nor
interest
nor
pity
but
curiosity
mingled
with
all
these
feelings
he
walked
slowly
with
a
step
that
betrayed
deep
melancholy
his
head
forward
with
a
stoop
but
not
bent
like
that
of
a
man
that
head
large
and
powerful
which
might
contain
the
treasures
necessary
for
a
man
of
the
highest
ambition
looked
as
if
it
were
loaded
with
thought
it
was
weighted
with
grief
of
mind
but
there
was
no
touch
of
remorse
in
his
expression
as
to
his
face
it
may
be
summed
up
in
a
word
a
common
superstition
has
it
that
every
human
countenance
resembles
some
animal
the
animal
for
marcas
was
the
lion
his
hair
was
like
a
mane
his
nose
was
sort
and
flat
broad
and
dented
at
the
tip
like
a
lion
s
his
brow
like
a
lion
s
was
strongly
marked
with
a
deep
median
furrow
dividing
two
powerful
bosses
his
high
hairy
all
the
more
prominent
because
his
cheeks
were
so
thin
his
enormous
mouth
and
hollow
jaws
were
accentuated
by
lines
of
tawny
shadows
this
almost
terrible
countenance
seemed
illuminated
by
two
lamps
two
eyes
black
indeed
but
infinitely
sweet
calm
and
deep
full
of
thought
if
i
may
say
so
those
eyes
had
a
humiliated
expression
marcas
was
afraid
of
looking
directly
at
others
not
for
himself
but
for
those
on
whom
his
fascinating
gaze
might
rest
he
had
a
power
and
he
shunned
using
it
he
would
spare
those
he
met
and
he
feared
notice
this
was
not
from
modesty
but
from
resignation
founded
on
reason
which
had
demonstrated
the
immediate
inutility
of
his
gifts
the
impossibility
of
entering
and
living
in
the
sphere
for
which
he
was
fitted
those
eyes
could
at
times
flash
lightnings
from
those
lips
a
voice
of
thunder
must
surely
proceed
it
was
a
mouth
like
mirabeau
s
i
have
seen
such
a
grand
fellow
in
the
street
said
i
to
juste
on
coming
in
it
must
be
our
neighbor
replied
juste
who
described
in
fact
the
man
i
had
just
met
a
man
who
lives
like
a
would
be
sure
to
look
like
that
he
added
what
dejection
and
what
dignity
one
is
the
consequence
of
the
what
ruined
hopes
what
schemes
and
failures
seven
leagues
of
ruins
obelisks
palaces
towers
the
ruins
of
palmyra
in
the
desert
said
juste
laughing
so
we
called
him
the
ruins
of
palmyra
as
we
went
out
to
dine
at
the
wretched
in
the
rue
de
la
harpe
to
which
we
subscribed
we
asked
the
name
of
number
and
then
heard
the
weird
name
marcas
like
boys
as
we
were
we
repeated
it
more
than
a
hundred
times
with
all
sorts
of
comments
absurd
or
melancholy
and
the
name
lent
itself
to
a
jest
juste
would
fire
off
the
z
like
a
rocket
rising
and
after
pronouncing
the
first
syllable
of
the
name
with
great
importance
depicted
a
fall
by
the
dull
brevity
of
the
second
now
how
and
where
does
the
man
live
from
this
query
to
the
innocent
espionage
of
curiosity
there
was
no
pause
but
that
required
for
carrying
out
our
plan
instead
of
loitering
about
the
streets
we
both
came
in
each
armed
with
a
novel
we
read
with
our
ears
open
and
in
the
perfect
silence
of
our
attic
rooms
we
heard
the
even
dull
sound
of
a
sleeping
man
breathing
he
is
asleep
said
i
to
juste
noticing
this
fact
at
seven
o
clock
replied
the
doctor
this
was
the
name
by
which
i
called
juste
and
he
called
me
the
keeper
of
the
seals
a
man
must
be
wretched
indeed
to
sleep
as
much
as
our
neighbor
cried
i
jumping
on
to
the
chest
of
drawers
with
a
knife
in
my
hand
to
which
a
corkscrew
was
attached
i
made
a
round
hole
at
the
top
of
the
partition
about
as
big
as
a
piece
i
had
forgotten
that
there
would
be
no
light
in
the
room
and
on
putting
my
eye
to
the
hole
i
saw
only
darkness
at
about
one
in
the
morning
when
we
had
finished
our
books
and
were
about
to
undress
we
heard
a
noise
in
our
neighbor
s
room
he
got
up
struck
a
match
and
lighted
his
dip
i
got
on
to
the
drawers
again
and
i
then
saw
marcas
seated
at
his
table
and
copying
his
room
was
about
half
the
size
of
ours
the
bed
stood
in
a
recess
by
the
door
for
the
passage
ended
there
and
its
breadth
was
added
to
his
garret
but
the
ground
on
which
the
house
was
built
was
evidently
irregular
for
the
formed
an
obtuse
angle
and
the
room
was
not
square
there
was
no
fireplace
only
a
small
earthenware
stove
white
blotched
with
green
of
which
the
pipe
went
up
through
the
roof
the
window
in
the
skew
side
of
the
room
had
shabby
red
curtains
the
furniture
consisted
of
an
armchair
a
table
a
chair
and
a
wretched
a
cupboard
in
the
wall
held
his
clothes
the
was
horrible
evidently
only
a
servant
had
ever
been
lodged
there
before
marcas
what
is
to
be
seen
asked
the
doctor
as
i
got
down
look
for
yourself
said
i
at
nine
next
morning
marcas
was
in
bed
he
had
breakfasted
off
a
saveloy
we
saw
on
a
plate
with
some
crumbs
of
bread
the
remains
of
that
too
familiar
delicacy
he
was
asleep
he
did
not
wake
till
eleven
he
then
set
to
work
again
on
the
copy
he
had
begun
the
night
before
which
was
lying
on
the
table
on
going
downstairs
we
asked
the
price
of
that
room
and
were
told
fifteen
francs
a
month
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
we
were
fully
informed
as
to
the
mode
of
life
of
marcas
he
did
copying
at
so
much
a
sheet
no
doubt
for
a
who
lived
in
the
courtyard
of
the
he
worked
half
the
night
after
sleeping
from
six
till
ten
he
began
again
and
wrote
till
three
then
he
went
out
to
take
the
copy
home
before
dinner
which
he
ate
at
mizerai
s
in
the
rue
at
a
cost
of
nine
sous
and
came
in
to
bed
at
six
o
clock
it
became
known
to
us
that
marcas
did
not
utter
fifteen
sentences
in
a
month
he
never
talked
to
anybody
nor
said
a
word
to
himself
in
his
dreadful
garret
the
ruins
of
palmyra
are
terribly
silent
said
juste
this
taciturnity
in
a
man
whose
appearance
was
so
imposing
was
strangely
significant
sometimes
when
we
met
him
we
exchanged
glances
full
of
meaning
on
both
sides
but
they
never
led
to
any
advances
insensibly
this
man
became
the
object
of
our
secret
admiration
though
we
knew
no
reason
for
it
did
it
lie
in
his
secretly
simple
habits
his
monastic
regularity
his
frugality
his
idiotically
mechanical
labor
allowing
his
mind
to
remain
neuter
or
to
work
on
his
own
lines
seeming
to
us
to
hint
at
an
expectation
of
some
stroke
of
good
luck
or
at
some
foregone
conclusion
as
to
his
life
after
wandering
for
a
long
time
among
the
ruins
of
palmyra
we
forgot
them
we
were
young
then
came
the
carnival
the
paris
carnival
which
henceforth
will
eclipse
the
old
carnival
of
venice
unless
some
prefect
of
police
is
antagonistic
gambling
ought
to
be
allowed
during
the
carnival
but
the
stupid
moralists
who
have
had
gambling
suppressed
are
inert
financiers
and
this
indispensable
evil
will
be
among
us
when
it
is
proved
that
france
leaves
millions
at
the
german
tables
this
splendid
carnival
brought
us
to
utter
penury
as
it
does
every
student
we
got
rid
of
every
object
of
luxury
we
sold
our
second
coats
our
second
boots
our
second
waistcoats
everything
of
which
we
had
a
duplicate
except
our
friend
we
ate
bread
and
cold
sausages
we
looked
where
we
walked
we
had
set
to
work
in
earnest
we
owed
two
months
rent
and
were
sure
of
having
a
bill
from
the
porter
for
sixty
or
eighty
items
each
and
amounting
to
forty
or
fifty
francs
we
made
no
noise
and
did
not
laugh
as
we
crossed
the
little
hall
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
we
commonly
took
it
at
a
flying
leap
from
the
lowest
step
into
the
street
on
the
day
when
we
first
found
ourselves
bereft
of
tobacco
for
our
pipes
it
struck
us
that
for
some
days
we
had
been
eating
bread
without
any
kind
of
butter
great
was
our
distress
no
tobacco
said
the
doctor
no
cloak
said
the
keeper
of
the
seals
ah
you
rascals
you
would
dress
as
the
postillion
de
longjumeau
you
would
appear
as
debardeurs
sup
in
the
morning
and
breakfast
at
night
at
very
s
sometimes
even
at
the
de
dry
bread
for
you
my
boys
why
said
i
in
a
big
bass
voice
you
deserve
to
sleep
under
the
bed
you
are
not
worthy
to
lie
in
it
yes
yes
but
keeper
of
the
seals
there
is
no
more
tobacco
said
juste
it
is
high
time
to
write
home
to
our
aunts
our
mothers
and
our
sisters
to
tell
them
we
have
no
underlinen
left
that
the
wear
and
tear
of
paris
would
ruin
garments
of
wire
then
we
will
solve
an
elegant
chemical
problem
by
transmuting
linen
into
but
we
must
live
till
we
get
the
well
i
will
go
and
bring
out
a
loan
among
such
of
our
friends
as
may
still
have
some
capital
to
and
how
much
will
you
find
say
ten
francs
replied
i
with
pride
it
was
midnight
marcas
had
heard
everything
he
knocked
at
our
door
messieurs
said
he
here
is
some
tobacco
you
can
repay
me
on
the
first
we
were
struck
not
by
the
offer
which
we
accepted
but
by
the
rich
deep
full
voice
in
which
it
was
made
a
tone
only
comparable
to
the
lowest
string
of
paganini
s
violin
marcas
vanished
without
waiting
for
our
thanks
juste
and
i
looked
at
each
other
without
a
word
to
be
rescued
by
a
man
evidently
poorer
than
ourselves
juste
sat
down
to
write
to
every
member
of
his
family
and
i
went
off
to
effect
a
loan
i
brought
in
twenty
francs
lent
me
by
a
in
that
evil
but
happy
day
gambling
was
still
tolerated
and
in
its
lodes
as
hard
as
the
rocky
ore
of
brazil
young
men
by
risking
a
small
sum
had
a
chance
of
winning
a
few
gold
pieces
my
friend
too
had
some
turkish
tobacco
brought
home
from
constantinople
by
a
sailor
and
he
gave
me
quite
as
much
as
we
had
taken
from
marcas
i
conveyed
the
splendid
cargo
into
port
and
we
went
in
triumph
to
repay
our
neighbor
with
a
tawny
wig
of
turkish
tobacco
for
his
dark
you
are
determined
not
to
be
my
debtors
said
he
you
are
giving
me
gold
for
you
are
boys
good
boys
the
sentences
spoken
in
varying
tones
were
variously
emphasized
the
words
were
nothing
but
the
expression
that
made
us
friends
of
ten
years
standing
at
once
marcas
on
hearing
us
coming
had
covered
up
his
papers
we
understood
that
it
would
be
taking
a
liberty
to
allude
to
his
means
of
subsistence
and
felt
ashamed
of
having
watched
him
his
cupboard
stood
open
in
it
there
were
two
shirts
a
white
necktie
and
a
razor
the
razor
made
me
shudder
a
worth
five
francs
perhaps
hung
near
the
window
the
man
s
few
and
simple
movements
had
a
sort
of
savage
grandeur
the
doctor
and
i
looked
at
each
other
wondering
what
we
could
say
in
reply
juste
seeing
that
i
was
speechless
asked
marcas
jestingly
you
cultivate
literature
monsieur
far
from
it
replied
marcas
i
should
not
be
so
i
fancied
said
i
that
poetry
alone
in
these
days
was
amply
sufficient
to
provide
a
man
with
lodgings
as
bad
as
my
remark
made
marcas
smile
and
the
smile
gave
a
charm
to
his
yellow
face
ambition
is
not
a
less
severe
taskmaster
to
those
who
fail
said
he
you
who
are
beginning
life
walk
in
the
beaten
paths
never
dream
of
rising
superior
you
will
be
ruined
you
advise
us
to
stay
just
as
we
are
said
the
doctor
smiling
there
is
something
so
infectious
and
childlike
in
the
pleasantries
of
youth
that
marcas
smiled
again
in
reply
what
incidents
can
have
given
you
this
detestable
philosophy
asked
i
i
forgot
once
more
that
chance
is
the
result
of
an
immense
equation
of
which
we
know
not
all
the
factors
when
we
start
from
zero
to
work
up
to
the
unit
the
chances
are
incalculable
to
ambitious
men
paris
is
an
immense
roulette
table
and
every
young
man
fancies
he
can
hit
on
a
successful
progression
of
he
offered
us
the
tobacco
i
had
brought
that
we
might
smoke
with
him
the
doctor
went
to
fetch
our
pipes
marcas
filled
his
and
then
he
came
to
sit
in
our
room
bringing
the
tobacco
with
him
since
there
were
but
two
chairs
in
his
juste
as
brisk
as
a
squirrel
ran
out
and
returned
with
a
boy
carrying
three
bottles
of
bordeaux
some
brie
cheese
and
a
loaf
hah
said
i
to
myself
fifteen
francs
and
i
was
right
to
a
sou
juste
gravely
laid
five
francs
on
the
there
are
immeasurable
differences
between
the
gregarious
man
and
the
man
who
lives
closest
to
nature
toussaint
louverture
after
he
was
caught
died
without
speaking
a
word
napoleon
transplanted
to
a
rock
talked
like
a
magpie
he
wanted
to
account
for
himself
marcas
erred
in
the
same
way
but
for
our
benefit
only
silence
in
all
its
majesty
is
to
be
found
only
in
the
savage
there
is
never
a
criminal
who
though
he
might
let
his
secrets
fall
with
his
head
into
the
basket
of
sawdust
does
not
feel
the
purely
social
impulse
to
tell
them
to
somebody
nay
i
am
wrong
we
have
seen
one
iroquois
of
the
faubourg
who
raised
the
parisian
to
the
level
of
the
natural
savage
a
republican
a
conspirator
a
frenchman
an
old
man
who
outdid
all
we
have
heard
of
negro
determination
and
all
that
cooper
tells
us
of
the
tenacity
and
coolness
of
the
redskins
under
defeat
morey
the
guatimozin
of
the
mountain
preserved
an
attitude
unparalleled
in
the
annals
of
european
justice
this
is
what
marcas
told
us
during
the
small
hours
sandwiching
his
discourse
with
slices
of
bread
spread
with
cheese
and
washed
down
with
wine
all
the
tobacco
was
burned
out
now
and
then
the
hackney
coaches
clattering
across
the
place
de
l
odeon
or
the
omnibuses
toiling
past
sent
up
their
dull
rumbling
as
if
to
remind
us
that
paris
was
still
close
to
us
his
family
lived
at
vitre
his
father
and
mother
had
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
in
the
funds
he
had
received
an
education
gratis
in
a
seminary
but
had
refused
to
enter
the
priesthood
he
felt
in
himself
the
fires
of
immense
ambition
and
had
come
to
paris
on
foot
at
the
age
of
twenty
the
possessor
of
two
hundred
francs
he
had
studied
the
law
working
in
an
attorney
s
office
where
he
had
risen
to
be
superior
clerk
he
had
taken
his
doctor
s
degree
in
law
had
mastered
the
old
and
modern
codes
and
could
hold
his
own
with
the
most
famous
pleaders
he
had
studied
the
law
of
nations
and
was
familiar
with
european
treaties
and
international
practice
he
had
studied
men
and
things
in
five
capitals
london
berlin
vienna
petersburg
and
constantinople
no
man
was
better
informed
than
he
as
to
the
rules
of
the
chamber
for
five
years
he
had
been
reporter
of
the
debates
for
a
daily
paper
he
spoke
extempore
and
admirably
and
could
go
on
for
a
long
time
in
that
deep
appealing
voice
which
had
struck
us
to
the
soul
indeed
he
proved
by
the
narrative
of
his
life
that
he
was
a
great
orator
a
concise
orator
serious
and
yet
full
of
piercing
eloquence
he
resembled
berryer
in
his
fervor
and
in
the
impetus
which
commands
the
sympathy
of
the
masses
and
was
like
thiers
in
refinement
and
skill
but
he
would
have
been
less
diffuse
less
in
difficulties
for
a
conclusion
he
had
intended
to
rise
rapidly
to
power
without
burdening
himself
first
with
the
doctrines
necessary
to
begin
with
for
a
man
in
opposition
but
an
incubus
later
to
the
statesman
marcas
had
learned
everything
that
a
real
statesman
should
know
indeed
his
amazement
was
considerable
when
he
had
occasion
to
discern
the
utter
ignorance
of
men
who
have
risen
to
the
administration
of
public
affairs
in
france
though
in
him
it
was
vocation
that
had
led
to
study
nature
had
been
generous
and
bestowed
all
that
can
not
be
acquired
keen
perceptions
a
nimble
wit
rapid
judgment
decisiveness
and
what
is
the
genius
of
these
men
fertility
in
resource
by
the
time
when
marcas
thought
himself
duly
equipped
france
was
torn
by
intestine
divisions
arising
from
the
triumph
of
the
house
of
orleans
over
the
elder
branch
of
the
bourbons
the
field
of
political
warfare
is
evidently
changed
civil
war
henceforth
can
not
last
for
long
and
will
not
be
fought
out
in
the
provinces
in
france
such
struggles
will
be
of
brief
duration
and
at
the
seat
of
government
and
the
battle
will
be
the
close
of
the
moral
contest
which
will
have
been
brought
to
an
issue
by
superior
minds
this
state
of
things
will
continue
so
long
as
france
has
her
present
singular
form
of
government
which
has
no
analogy
with
that
of
any
other
country
for
there
is
no
more
resemblance
between
the
english
and
the
french
constitutions
than
between
the
two
lands
thus
marcas
place
was
in
the
political
press
being
poor
and
unable
to
secure
his
election
he
hoped
to
make
a
sudden
appearance
he
resolved
on
making
the
greatest
possible
sacrifice
for
a
man
of
superior
intellect
to
work
as
a
subordinate
to
some
rich
and
ambitious
deputy
like
a
second
bonaparte
he
sought
his
barras
the
new
colbert
hoped
to
find
a
mazarin
he
did
immense
services
and
he
did
them
then
and
there
he
assumed
no
importance
he
made
no
boast
he
did
not
complain
of
ingratitude
he
did
them
in
the
hope
that
his
patron
would
put
him
in
a
position
to
be
elected
deputy
marcas
wished
for
nothing
but
a
loan
that
might
enable
him
to
purchase
a
house
in
paris
the
qualification
required
by
law
richard
iii
asked
for
nothing
but
his
horse
in
three
years
marcas
had
made
his
man
one
of
the
fifty
supposed
great
statesmen
who
are
the
battledores
with
which
two
cunning
players
toss
the
ministerial
portfolios
exactly
as
the
man
behind
the
hits
punch
against
the
constable
in
his
street
theatre
and
counts
on
always
getting
paid
this
man
existed
only
by
marcas
but
he
had
just
brains
enough
to
appreciate
the
value
of
his
ghost
and
to
know
that
marcas
if
he
ever
came
to
the
front
would
remain
there
would
be
indispensable
while
he
himself
would
be
translated
to
the
polar
zone
of
luxembourg
so
he
determined
to
put
insurmountable
obstacles
in
the
way
of
his
mentor
s
advancement
and
hid
his
purpose
under
the
semblance
of
the
utmost
sincerity
like
all
mean
men
he
could
dissimulate
to
perfection
and
he
soon
made
progress
in
the
ways
of
ingratitude
for
he
felt
that
he
must
kill
marcas
not
to
be
killed
by
him
these
two
men
apparently
so
united
hated
each
other
as
soon
as
one
had
deceived
the
other
the
politician
was
made
one
of
a
ministry
marcas
remained
in
the
opposition
to
hinder
his
man
from
being
attacked
nay
by
skilful
tactics
he
won
him
the
applause
of
the
opposition
to
excuse
himself
for
not
rewarding
his
subaltern
the
chief
pointed
out
the
impossibility
of
finding
a
place
suddenly
for
a
man
on
the
other
side
without
a
great
deal
of
manoeuvring
marcas
had
hoped
confidently
for
a
place
to
enable
him
to
marry
and
thus
acquire
the
qualification
he
so
ardently
desired
he
was
and
the
chamber
ere
long
must
be
dissolved
having
detected
his
man
in
this
flagrant
act
of
bad
faith
he
overthrew
him
or
at
any
rate
contributed
largely
to
his
overthrow
and
covered
him
with
mud
a
fallen
minister
if
he
is
to
rise
again
to
power
must
show
that
he
is
to
be
feared
this
man
intoxicated
by
royal
glibness
had
fancied
that
his
position
would
be
permanent
he
acknowledged
his
delinquencies
besides
confessing
them
he
did
marcas
a
small
money
service
for
marcas
had
got
into
debt
he
subsidized
the
newspaper
on
which
marcas
worked
and
made
him
the
manager
of
it
though
he
despised
the
man
marcas
who
practically
was
being
subsidized
too
consented
to
take
the
part
of
the
fallen
minister
without
unmasking
at
once
all
the
batteries
of
his
superior
intellect
marcas
came
a
little
further
than
before
he
showed
half
his
shrewdness
the
ministry
lasted
only
a
hundred
and
eighty
days
it
was
swallowed
up
marcas
had
put
himself
into
communication
with
certain
deputies
had
moulded
them
like
dough
leaving
each
impressed
with
a
high
opinion
of
his
talent
his
puppet
again
became
a
member
of
the
ministry
and
then
the
paper
was
ministerial
the
ministry
united
the
paper
with
another
solely
to
squeeze
out
marcas
who
in
this
fusion
had
to
make
way
for
a
rich
and
insolent
rival
whose
name
was
well
known
and
who
already
had
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
marcas
relapsed
into
utter
destitution
his
haughty
patron
well
knew
the
depths
into
which
he
had
cast
him
where
was
he
to
go
the
ministerial
papers
privily
warned
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
the
opposition
papers
did
not
care
to
admit
him
to
their
offices
marcas
could
side
neither
with
the
republicans
nor
with
the
legitimists
two
parties
whose
triumph
would
mean
the
overthrow
of
everything
that
now
is
ambitious
men
like
a
fast
hold
on
things
said
he
with
a
smile
he
lived
by
writing
a
few
articles
on
commercial
affairs
and
contributed
to
one
of
those
encyclopedias
brought
out
by
speculation
and
not
by
learning
finally
a
paper
was
founded
which
was
destined
to
live
but
two
years
but
which
secured
his
services
from
that
moment
he
renewed
his
connection
with
the
minister
s
enemies
he
joined
the
party
who
were
working
for
the
fall
of
the
government
and
as
soon
as
his
pickaxe
had
free
play
it
fell
this
paper
had
now
for
six
months
ceased
to
exist
he
had
failed
to
find
employment
of
any
kind
he
was
spoken
of
as
a
dangerous
man
calumny
attacked
him
he
had
unmasked
a
huge
financial
and
mercantile
job
by
a
few
articles
and
a
pamphlet
he
was
known
to
be
a
mouthpiece
of
a
banker
who
was
said
to
have
paid
him
largely
and
from
whom
he
was
supposed
to
expect
some
patronage
in
return
for
his
championship
marcas
disgusted
by
men
and
things
worn
out
by
five
years
of
fighting
regarded
as
a
free
lance
rather
than
as
a
great
leader
crushed
by
the
necessity
of
earning
his
daily
bread
which
hindered
him
from
gaining
ground
in
despair
at
the
influence
exerted
by
money
over
mind
and
given
over
to
dire
poverty
buried
himself
in
a
garret
to
make
thirty
sous
a
day
the
sum
strictly
answering
to
his
needs
meditation
had
leveled
a
desert
all
round
him
he
read
the
papers
to
be
informed
of
what
was
going
on
pozzo
di
borgo
had
once
lived
like
this
for
some
time
marcas
no
doubt
was
planning
a
serious
attack
accustoming
himself
to
dissimulation
and
punishing
himself
for
his
blunders
by
pythagorean
muteness
but
he
did
not
tell
us
the
reasons
for
his
conduct
it
is
impossible
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
scenes
of
the
highest
comedy
that
lay
behind
this
algebraic
statement
of
his
career
his
useless
patience
dogging
the
footsteps
of
fortune
which
presently
took
wings
his
long
tramps
over
the
thorny
brakes
of
paris
his
breathless
chases
as
a
petitioner
his
attempts
to
win
over
fools
the
schemes
laid
only
to
fail
through
the
influence
of
some
frivolous
woman
the
meetings
with
men
of
business
who
expected
their
capital
to
bring
them
places
and
a
peerage
as
well
as
large
interest
then
the
hopes
rising
in
a
towering
wave
only
to
break
in
foam
on
the
shoal
the
wonders
wrought
in
reconciling
adverse
interests
which
after
working
together
for
a
week
fell
asunder
the
annoyance
a
thousand
times
repeated
of
seeing
a
dunce
decorated
with
the
legion
of
honor
and
preferred
though
as
ignorant
as
a
to
a
man
of
talent
then
what
marcas
called
the
stratagems
of
stupidity
you
strike
a
man
and
he
seems
convinced
he
nods
his
head
everything
is
settled
next
day
this
ball
flattened
for
a
moment
has
recovered
itself
in
the
course
of
the
night
it
is
as
full
of
wind
as
ever
you
must
begin
all
over
again
and
you
go
on
till
you
understand
that
you
are
not
dealing
with
a
man
but
with
a
lump
of
gum
that
loses
shape
in
the
sunshine
these
thousand
annoyances
this
vast
waste
of
human
energy
on
barren
spots
the
difficulty
of
achieving
any
good
the
incredible
facility
of
doing
mischief
two
strong
games
played
out
twice
won
and
then
twice
lost
the
hatred
of
a
statesman
a
blockhead
with
a
painted
face
and
a
wig
but
in
whom
the
world
believed
all
these
things
great
and
small
had
not
crushed
but
for
the
moment
had
dashed
marcas
in
the
days
when
money
had
come
into
his
hands
his
fingers
had
not
clutched
it
he
had
allowed
himself
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
sending
it
all
to
his
family
to
his
sisters
his
brothers
his
old
father
like
napoleon
in
his
fall
he
asked
for
no
more
than
thirty
sous
a
day
and
any
man
of
energy
can
earn
thirty
sous
for
a
day
s
work
in
paris
when
marcas
had
finished
the
story
of
his
life
intermingled
with
reflections
maxims
and
observations
revealing
him
as
a
great
politician
a
few
questions
and
answers
on
both
sides
as
to
the
progress
of
affairs
in
france
and
in
europe
were
enough
to
prove
to
us
that
he
was
a
real
statesman
for
a
man
may
be
quickly
and
easily
judged
when
he
can
be
brought
on
to
the
ground
of
immediate
difficulties
there
is
a
certain
shibboleth
for
men
of
superior
talents
and
we
were
of
the
tribe
of
modern
levites
without
belonging
as
yet
to
the
temple
as
i
have
said
our
frivolity
covered
certain
purposes
which
juste
has
carried
out
and
which
i
am
about
to
execute
when
we
had
done
talking
we
all
three
went
out
cold
as
it
was
to
walk
in
the
luxembourg
gardens
till
the
dinner
hour
in
the
course
of
that
walk
our
conversation
grave
throughout
turned
on
the
painful
aspects
of
the
political
situation
each
of
us
contributed
his
remarks
his
comment
or
his
jest
a
pleasantry
or
a
proverb
this
was
no
longer
exclusively
a
discussion
of
life
on
the
colossal
scale
just
described
by
marcas
the
soldier
of
political
warfare
nor
was
it
the
distressful
monologue
of
the
wrecked
navigator
stranded
in
a
garret
in
the
hotel
corneille
it
was
a
dialogue
in
which
two
young
men
having
gauged
the
times
they
lived
in
were
endeavoring
under
the
guidance
of
a
man
of
talent
to
gain
some
light
on
their
own
future
prospects
why
asked
juste
did
you
not
wait
patiently
for
an
opportunity
and
imitate
the
only
man
who
has
been
able
to
keep
the
lead
since
the
revolution
of
july
by
holding
his
head
above
water
have
i
not
said
that
we
never
know
where
the
roots
of
chance
lie
carrell
was
in
identically
the
same
position
as
the
orator
you
speak
of
that
gloomy
young
man
of
a
bitter
spirit
had
a
whole
government
in
his
head
the
man
of
whom
you
speak
had
no
idea
beyond
mounting
on
the
crupper
of
every
event
of
the
two
carrel
was
the
better
man
well
one
becomes
a
minister
carrel
remained
a
journalist
the
incomplete
but
craftier
man
is
living
carrel
is
dead
i
may
point
out
that
your
man
has
for
fifteen
years
been
making
his
way
and
is
but
making
it
still
he
may
yet
be
caught
and
crushed
between
two
cars
full
of
intrigues
on
the
highroad
to
power
he
has
no
house
he
has
not
the
favor
of
the
palace
like
metternich
nor
like
villele
the
protection
of
a
compact
majority
i
do
not
believe
that
the
present
state
of
things
will
last
ten
years
longer
hence
supposing
i
should
have
such
poor
good
luck
i
am
already
too
late
to
avoid
being
swept
away
by
the
commotion
i
foresee
i
should
need
to
be
established
in
a
superior
what
commotion
asked

august
said
marcas
in
solemn
tones
holding
out
his
hand
towards
paris
august
the
offspring
of
youth
which
bound
the
sheaves
and
of
intellect
which
had
ripened
the
harvest
forgot
to
provide
for
youth
and
intellect
youth
will
explode
like
the
boiler
of
a
youth
has
no
outlet
in
france
it
is
gathering
an
avalanche
of
underrated
capabilities
of
legitimate
and
restless
ambitions
young
men
are
not
marrying
now
families
can
not
tell
what
to
do
with
their

what
will
the
thunderclap
be

will
shake
down
these
masses
i
know
not
but
they
will
crash
down
into
the
midst
of
things
and
overthrow
everything
these
are
laws
of
hydrostatics
which
act
on
the
human
race
the
roman
empire
had
failed
to
understand
them
and
the
barbaric

the
barbaric
hordes
now
are
the
intelligent
class
the
laws
of
overpressure
are
at
this
moment
acting
slowly
and
silently
in
our
midst
the
government
is
the
great
criminal
it
does
not
appreciate
the
two
powers
to
which
it
owes
everything
it
has
allowed
its
hands
to
be
tied
by
the
absurdities
of

ready

louis

england
all
were
or
are
eager
for
intelligent
youth
in
france
the
young
are
condemned
by
the
new
legislation
by
the
blundering
principles
of
elective
rights
by
the
unsoundness
of
the
ministerial
constitution
look
at
the
elective
chamber
you
will
find
no
deputies
of
thirty
the
youth
of
richelieu
and
of
mazarin
of
turenne
and
of
colbert
of
pitt
and
of
of
napoleon
and
of
prince
metternich
would
find
no
admission
there
burke
sheridan
or

could
not
win
seats
even
if
political
majority
had
been
fixed
at
and
eligibility
had
been
relieved
of
every
disabling
qualification
the
departments
would
have
returned
the
very
same
members
men
devoid
of
political
talent
unable
to
speak
without
murdering
french
grammar
and
among
whom
in
ten
years
scarcely
one
statesman
has
been
found
the
causes
of
an
impending
event
may
be
seen
but
the
event
itself
can
not
be
foretold
at
this
moment
the
youth
of
france
is
being
driven
into
republicanism
because
it
believes
that
the
republic
would
bring
it
emancipation
it
will
always
remember
the
young
representatives
of
the
people
and
the
young
army
leaders
the
imprudence
of
the
government
is
only
comparable
to
its
that
day
left
its
echoes
in
our
lives
marcas
confirmed
us
in
our
resolution
to
leave
france
where
young
men
of
talent
and
energy
are
crushed
under
the
weight
of
successful
commonplace
envious
and
insatiable
middle
age
we
dined
together
in
the
rue
de
la
harpe
we
thenceforth
felt
for
marcas
the
most
respectful
affection
he
gave
us
the
most
practical
aid
in
the
sphere
of
the
mind
that
man
knew
everything
he
had
studied
everything
for
us
he
cast
his
eye
over
the
whole
civilized
world
seeking
the
country
where
openings
would
be
at
once
the
most
abundant
and
the
most
favorable
to
the
success
of
our
plans
he
indicated
what
should
be
the
goal
of
our
studies
he
bid
us
make
haste
explaining
to
us
that
time
was
precious
that
emigration
would
presently
begin
and
that
its
effect
would
be
to
deprive
france
of
the
cream
of
its
powers
and
of
its
youthful
talent
that
their
intelligence
necessarily
sharpened
would
select
the
best
places
and
that
the
great
thing
was
to
be
first
in
the
field
thenceforward
we
often
sat
late
at
work
under
the
lamp
our
generous
instructor
wrote
some
notes
for
our
guidance
two
pages
for
juste
and
three
for
me
full
of
invaluable
advice
the
sort
of
information
which
experience
alone
can
supply
such
landmarks
as
only
genius
can
place
in
those
papers
smelling
of
tobacco
and
covered
with
writing
so
vile
as
to
be
almost
hieroglyphic
there
are
suggestions
for
a
fortune
and
forecasts
of
unerring
acumen
there
are
hints
as
to
certain
parts
of
america
and
asia
which
have
been
fully
justified
both
before
and
since
juste
and
i
could
set
out
marcas
like
us
was
in
the
most
abject
poverty
he
earned
indeed
his
daily
bread
but
he
had
neither
linen
clothes
nor
shoes
he
did
not
make
himself
out
any
better
than
he
was
his
dreams
had
been
of
luxury
as
well
as
of
power
he
did
not
admit
that
this
was
the
real
marcas
he
abandoned
this
person
indeed
to
the
caprices
of
life
what
he
lived
by
was
the
breath
of
ambition
he
dreamed
of
revenge
while
blaming
himself
for
yielding
to
so
shallow
a
feeling
the
true
statesman
ought
above
all
things
to
be
superior
to
vulgar
passions
like
the
man
of
science
it
was
in
these
days
of
dire
necessity
that
marcas
seemed
to
us
so
great
nay
so
terrible
there
was
something
awful
in
the
gaze
which
saw
another
world
than
that
which
strikes
the
eye
of
ordinary
men
to
us
he
was
a
subject
of
contemplation
and
astonishment
for
the
young
which
of
us
has
not
known
it
the
young
have
a
keen
craving
to
admire
they
love
to
attach
themselves
and
are
naturally
inclined
to
submit
to
the
men
they
feel
to
be
superior
as
they
are
to
devote
themselves
to
a
great
cause
our
surprise
was
chiefly
roused
by
his
indifference
in
matters
of
sentiment
women
had
no
place
in
his
life
when
we
spoke
of
this
matter
a
perennial
theme
of
conversation
among
frenchmen
he
simply
remarked
gowns
cost
too
he
saw
the
look
that
passed
between
juste
and
me
and
went
on
yes
far
too
much
the
woman
you
buy
and
she
is
the
least
expensive
takes
a
great
deal
of
money
the
woman
who
gives
herself
takes
all
your
time
woman
extinguishes
every
energy
every
ambition
napoleon
reduced
her
to
what
she
should
be
from
that
point
of
view
he
really
was
great
he
did
not
indulge
such
ruinous
fancies
of
louis
xiv
and
louis
xv
at
the
same
time
he
could
love
in
we
discovered
that
like
pitt
who
made
england
is
wife
marcas
bore
france
in
his
heart
he
idolized
his
country
he
had
not
a
thought
that
was
not
for
his
native
land
his
fury
at
feeling
that
he
had
in
his
hands
the
remedy
for
the
evils
which
so
deeply
saddened
him
and
could
not
apply
it
ate
into
his
soul
and
this
rage
was
increased
by
the
inferiority
of
france
at
that
time
as
compared
with
russia
and
england
france
a
power
this
cry
came
up
again
and
again
in
his
conversation
the
intestinal
disorders
of
his
country
had
entered
into
his
soul
all
the
contests
between
the
court
and
the
chamber
showing
as
they
did
incessant
change
and
constant
vacillation
which
must
injure
the
prosperity
of
the
country
he
scoffed
at
as
backstairs
squabbles
this
is
peace
at
the
cost
of
the
future
said
he
one
evening
juste
and
i
were
at
work
sitting
in
perfect
silence
marcas
had
just
risen
to
toil
at
his
copying
for
he
had
refused
our
assistance
in
spite
of
our
most
earnest
entreaties
we
had
offered
to
take
it
in
turns
to
copy
a
batch
of
manuscript
so
that
he
should
do
but
a
third
of
his
distasteful
task
he
had
been
quite
angry
and
we
had
ceased
to
insist
we
heard
the
sound
of
gentlemanly
boots
in
the
passage
and
raised
our
heads
looking
at
each
other
there
was
a
tap
at
marcas
door
he
never
took
the
key
out
of
the
lock
and
we
heard
the
hero
answer
come
then
what
you
here
monsieur
i
myself
replied
the
retired
minister
it
was
the
diocletian
of
this
unknown
martyr
for
some
time
he
and
our
neighbor
conversed
in
an
undertone
suddenly
marcas
whose
voice
had
been
heard
but
rarely
as
is
natural
in
a
dialogue
in
which
the
applicant
begins
by
setting
forth
the
situation
broke
out
loudly
in
reply
to
some
offer
we
had
not
overheard
you
would
laugh
at
me
for
a
fool
cried
he
if
i
took
you
at
your
word
jesuits
are
a
thing
of
the
past
but
jesuitism
is
eternal
your
machiavelism
and
your
generosity
are
equally
hollow
and
untrustworthy
you
can
make
your
own
calculations
but
who
can
calculate
on
you
your
court
is
made
up
of
owls
who
fear
the
light
of
old
men
who
quake
in
the
presence
of
the
young
or
who
simply
disregard
them
the
government
is
formed
on
the
same
pattern
as
the
court
you
have
hunted
up
the
remains
of
the
empire
as
the
restoration
enlisted
the
voltigeurs
of
louis
xiv
hitherto
the
evasions
of
cowardice
have
been
taken
for
the
manoeuvring
of
ability
but
dangers
will
come
and
the
younger
generation
will
rise
as
they
did
in
they
did
grand
things
just
now
you
change
ministries
as
a
sick
man
turns
in
his
bed
these
oscillations
betray
the
weakness
of
the
government
you
work
on
an
underhand
system
of
policy
which
will
be
turned
against
you
for
france
will
be
tired
of
your
shuffling
france
will
not
tell
you
that
she
is
tired
of
you
a
man
never
knows
whence
his
ruin
comes
it
is
the
historian
s
task
to
find
out
but
you
will
undoubtedly
perish
as
the
reward
of
not
having
the
youth
of
france
to
lend
you
its
strength
and
energy
for
having
hated
really
capable
men
for
not
having
lovingly
chosen
them
from
this
noble
generation
for
having
in
all
cases
preferred
mediocrity
you
have
come
to
ask
my
support
but
you
are
an
atom
in
that
decrepit
heap
which
is
made
hideous
by
which
trembles
and
squirms
and
because
it
is
so
mean
tries
to
make
france
mean
too
my
strong
nature
my
ideas
would
work
like
poison
in
you
twice
you
have
tricked
me
twice
have
i
overthrown
you
if
we
unite
a
third
time
it
must
be
a
very
serious
matter
i
should
kill
myself
if
i
allowed
myself
to
be
duped
for
i
should
be
to
blame
not
then
we
heard
the
humblest
entreaties
the
most
fervent
adjuration
not
to
deprive
the
country
of
such
superior
talents
the
man
spoke
of
patriotism
and
marcas
uttered
a
significant
ouh
he
laughed
at
his
patron
then
the
statesman
was
more
explicit
he
bowed
to
the
superiority
of
his
erewhile
counselor
he
pledged
himself
to
enable
marcas
to
remain
in
office
to
be
elected
deputy
then
he
offered
him
a
high
appointment
promising
him
that
he
the
speaker
would
thenceforth
be
the
subordinate
of
a
man
whose
subaltern
he
was
only
worthy
to
be
he
was
in
the
ministry
and
he
would
not
return
to
power
unless
marcas
had
a
post
in
proportion
to
his
merit
he
had
already
made
it
a
condition
marcas
had
been
regarded
as
indispensable
marcas
refused
i
have
never
before
been
in
a
position
to
keep
my
promises
here
is
an
opportunity
of
proving
myself
faithful
to
my
word
and
you
fail
to
this
marcas
made
no
reply
the
boots
were
again
audible
in
the
passage
on
the
way
to
the
stairs
marcas
marcas
we
both
cried
rushing
into
his
room
why
refuse
he
really
meant
it
his
offers
are
very
handsome
at
any
rate
go
to
see
the
in
a
twinkling
we
had
given
marcas
a
hundred
reasons
the
minister
s
voice
was
sincere
without
seeing
him
we
had
felt
sure
that
he
was
honest
i
have
no
clothes
replied
marcas
rely
on
us
said
juste
with
a
glance
at
me
marcas
had
the
courage
to
trust
us
a
light
flashed
in
his
eye
he
pushed
his
fingers
through
his
hair
lifting
it
from
his
forehead
with
a
gesture
that
showed
some
confidence
in
his
luck
and
when
he
had
thus
unveiled
his
face
so
to
speak
we
saw
in
him
a
man
absolutely
unknown
to
us
marcas
sublime
marcas
in
his
power
his
mind
was
in
its
element
the
bird
restored
to
the
free
air
the
fish
to
the
water
the
horse
galloping
across
the
plain
it
was
transient
his
brow
clouded
again
he
had
it
would
seem
a
vision
of
his
fate
halting
doubt
had
followed
close
on
the
heels
of
hope
we
left
him
to
himself
now
then
said
i
to
the
doctor
we
have
given
our
word
how
are
we
to
keep
it
we
will
sleep
upon
it
said
juste
and
morning
we
will
talk
it
next
morning
we
went
for
a
walk
in
the
luxembourg
we
had
had
time
to
think
over
the
incident
of
the
past
night
and
were
both
equally
surprised
at
the
lack
of
address
shown
by
marcas
in
the
minor
difficulties
of
life
he
a
man
who
never
saw
any
difficulties
in
the
solution
of
the
hardest
problems
of
abstract
or
practical
politics
but
these
elevated
characters
can
all
be
tripped
up
on
a
grain
of
sand
and
will
like
the
grandest
enterprise
miss
fire
for
want
of
a
thousand
francs
it
is
the
old
story
of
napoleon
who
for
lack
of
a
pair
of
boots
did
not
set
out
for
india
well
what
have
you
hit
upon
asked
juste
i
have
thought
of
a
way
to
get
him
a
complete
where
from
how
humann
my
boy
never
goes
to
his
customers
his
customers
go
to
him
so
that
he
does
not
know
whether
i
am
rich
or
poor
he
only
knows
that
i
dress
well
and
look
decent
in
the
clothes
he
makes
for
me
i
shall
tell
him
that
an
uncle
of
mine
has
dropped
in
from
the
country
and
that
his
indifference
in
matters
of
dress
is
quite
a
discredit
to
me
in
the
upper
circles
where
i
am
trying
to
find
a
it
will
not
be
humann
if
he
sends
in
his
bill
before
three
the
doctor
thought
this
a
capital
idea
for
a
vaudeville
but
poor
enough
in
real
life
and
doubted
my
success
but
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
humann
dressed
marcas
and
being
an
artist
turned
him
out
as
a
political
personage
ought
to
be
dressed
juste
lent
marcas
two
hundred
francs
in
gold
the
product
of
two
watches
bought
on
credit
and
pawned
at
the
for
my
part
i
had
said
nothing
of
the
six
shirts
and
all
necessary
linen
which
cost
me
no
more
than
the
pleasure
of
asking
for
them
from
a
forewoman
in
a
shop
whom
i
had
treated
to
musard
s
during
the
carnival
marcas
accepted
everything
thanking
us
no
more
than
he
ought
he
only
inquired
as
to
the
means
by
which
we
had
got
possession
of
such
riches
and
we
made
him
laugh
for
the
last
time
we
looked
on
our
marcas
as
shipowners
when
they
have
exhausted
their
credit
and
every
resource
at
their
command
it
fit
out
a
vessel
must
look
on
it
as
it
puts
out
to
sea
here
charles
was
silent
he
seemed
crushed
by
his
memories
well
cried
the
audience
and
what
happened
i
will
tell
you
in
a
few
words
for
this
is
not
romance
it
is
we
saw
no
more
of
marcas
the
administration
lasted
for
three
months
it
fell
at
the
end
of
the
session
then
marcas
came
back
to
us
worked
to
death
he
had
sounded
the
crater
of
power
he
came
away
from
it
with
the
beginnings
of
brain
fever
the
disease
made
rapid
progress
we
nursed
him
juste
at
once
called
in
the
chief
physician
of
the
hospital
where
he
was
working
as
i
was
then
living
alone
in
our
room
and
i
was
the
most
attentive
attendant
but
care
and
science
alike
were
in
vain
by
the
month
of
january
marcas
himself
felt
that
he
had
but
a
few
days
to
live
the
man
whose
soul
and
brain
he
had
been
for
six
months
never
even
sent
to
inquire
after
him
marcas
expressed
the
greatest
contempt
for
the
government
he
seemed
to
doubt
what
the
fate
of
france
might
be
and
it
was
this
doubt
that
had
made
him
ill
he
had
he
thought
detected
treason
in
the
heart
of
power
not
tangible
seizable
treason
the
result
of
facts
but
the
treason
of
a
system
the
subordination
of
national
interests
to
selfish
ends
his
belief
in
the
degradation
of
the
country
was
enough
to
aggravate
his
complaint
i
myself
was
witness
to
the
proposals
made
to
him
by
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
antagonistic
party
which
he
had
fought
against
his
hatred
of
the
men
he
had
tried
to
serve
was
so
virulent
that
he
would
gladly
have
joined
the
coalition
that
was
about
to
be
formed
among
certain
ambitious
spirits
who
at
least
had
one
idea
in
common
that
of
shaking
off
the
yoke
of
the
court
but
marcas
could
only
reply
to
the
envoy
in
the
words
of
the
hotel
de
ville
it
is
too
late
marcas
did
not
leave
money
enough
to
pay
for
his
funeral
juste
and
i
had
great
difficulty
in
saving
him
from
the
ignominy
of
a
pauper
s
bier
and
we
alone
followed
the
coffin
of
marcas
which
was
dropped
into
the
common
grave
of
the
cemetery
of
we
looked
sadly
at
each
other
as
we
listened
to
this
tale
the
last
we
heard
from
the
lips
of
charles
rabourdin
the
day
before
he
embarked
at
le
havre
on
a
brig
that
was
to
convey
him
to
the
islands
of
malay
we
all
knew
more
than
one
marcas
more
than
one
victim
of
his
devotion
to
a
party
repaid
by
betrayal
or
neglect
les

following
personage

stories
