preface
the
object
of
this
volume
is
to
place
before
the
general
reader
our
two
early
poetic
masterpieces
the
canterbury
tales
and
the
faerie
queen
to
do
so
in
a
way
that
will
render
their
popular
perusal
easy
in
a
time
of
little
leisure
and
unbounded
temptations
to
intellectual
languor
and
on
the
same
conditions
to
present
a
liberal
and
fairly
representative
selection
from
the
less
important
and
familiar
poems
of
chaucer
and
spenser
there
is
it
may
be
said
at
the
outset
peculiar
advantage
and
propriety
in
placing
the
two
poets
side
by
side
in
the
manner
now
attempted
for
the
first
time
although
two
centuries
divide
them
yet
spenser
is
the
direct
and
really
the
immediate
successor
to
the
poetical
inheritance
of
chaucer
those
two
hundred
years
eventful
as
they
were
produced
no
poet
at
all
worthy
to
take
up
the
mantle
that
fell
from
chaucer
shoulders
and
spenser
does
not
need
his
affected
archaisms
nor
his
frequent
and
reverent
appeals
to
dan
geffrey
to
vindicate
for
himself
a
place
very
close
to
his
great
predecessor
in
the
literary
history
of
england
if
chaucer
is
the
well
of
english
undefiled
spenser
is
the
broad
and
stately
river
that
yet
holds
the
tenure
of
its
very
life
from
the
fountain
far
away
in
other
and
ruder
scenes
the
canterbury
tales
so
far
as
they
are
in
verse
have
been
printed
without
any
abridgement
or
designed
change
in
the
sense
but
the
two
tales
in
prose
chaucer
tale
of
meliboeus
and
the
parson
long
sermon
on
penitence
have
been
contracted
so
as
to
exclude
thirty
pages
of
unattractive
prose
and
to
admit
the
same
amount
of
interesting
and
characteristic
poetry
the
gaps
thus
made
in
the
prose
tales
however
are
supplied
by
careful
outlines
of
the
omitted
matter
so
that
the
reader
need
be
at
no
loss
to
comprehend
the
whole
scope
and
sequence
of
the
original
with
the
faerie
queen
a
bolder
course
has
been
pursued
the
great
obstacle
to
the
popularity
of
spencer
splendid
work
has
lain
less
in
its
language
than
in
its
length
if
we
add
together
the
three
great
poems
of
antiquity
the
books
of
the
iliad
the
books
of
the
odyssey
and
the
twelve
books
of
the
aeneid
we
get
at
the
dimensions
of
only
of
the
faerie
queen
the
six
books
and
the
fragment
of
a
seventh
which
alone
exist
of
the
author
contemplated
twelve
number
about
verses
the
sixty
books
of
homer
and
virgil
number
no
more
than
the
mere
bulk
of
the
poem
then
has
opposed
a
formidable
barrier
to
its
popularity
to
say
nothing
of
the
distracting
effect
produced
by
the
numberless
episodes
the
tedious
narrations
and
the
constant
repetitions
which
have
largely
swelled
that
bulk
in
this
volume
the
poem
is
compressed
into
of
its
original
space
through
the
expedient
of
representing
the
less
interesting
and
more
mechanical
passages
by
a
condensed
prose
outline
in
which
it
has
been
sought
as
far
as
possible
to
preserve
the
very
words
of
the
poet
while
deprecating
a
too
critical
judgement
on
the
bare
and
constrained
precis
standing
in
such
trying
juxtaposition
it
is
hoped
that
the
labour
bestowed
in
saving
the
reader
the
trouble
of
wading
through
much
that
is
not
essential
for
the
enjoyment
of
spencer
marvellous
allegory
will
not
be
unappreciated
as
regards
the
manner
in
which
the
text
of
the
two
great
works
especially
of
the
canterbury
tales
is
presented
the
editor
is
aware
that
some
whose
judgement
is
weighty
will
differ
from
him
this
volume
has
been
prepared
for
popular
perusal
and
its
very
raison
would
have
failed
if
the
ancient
orthography
had
been
retained
it
has
often
been
affirmed
by
editors
of
chaucer
in
the
old
forms
of
the
language
that
a
little
trouble
at
first
would
render
the
antiquated
spelling
and
obsolete
inflections
a
continual
source
not
of
difficulty
but
of
actual
delight
for
the
reader
coming
to
the
study
of
chaucer
without
any
preliminary
acquaintance
with
the
english
of
his
day
or
of
his
copyists
days
despite
this
complacent
assurance
the
obvious
fact
is
that
chaucer
in
the
old
forms
has
not
become
popular
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
he
is
not
understanded
of
the
vulgar
in
this
volume
therefore
the
text
of
chaucer
has
been
presented
in
garb
but
there
has
been
not
the
slightest
attempt
to
modernise
chaucer
in
the
wider
meaning
of
the
phrase
to
replace
his
words
by
words
which
he
did
not
use
or
following
the
example
of
some
operators
to
translate
him
into
english
of
the
modern
spirit
as
well
as
the
modern
forms
so
far
from
that
in
every
case
where
the
old
spelling
or
form
seemed
essential
to
metre
to
rhyme
or
meaning
no
change
has
been
attempted
but
wherever
its
preservation
was
not
essential
the
spelling
of
the
monkish
transcribers
for
the
most
ardent
purist
must
now
despair
of
getting
at
the
spelling
of
chaucer
himself
has
been
discarded
for
that
of
the
reader
own
day
it
is
a
poor
compliment
to
the
father
of
english
poetry
to
say
that
by
such
treatment
the
bouquet
and
individuality
of
his
works
must
be
lost
if
his
masterpiece
is
valuable
for
one
thing
more
than
any
other
it
is
the
vivid
distinctness
with
which
english
men
and
women
of
the
fourteenth
century
are
there
painted
for
the
study
of
all
the
centuries
to
follow
but
we
wantonly
balk
the
own
purpose
and
discredit
his
labour
when
we
keep
before
his
picture
the
screen
of
dust
and
cobwebs
which
for
the
english
people
in
these
days
the
crude
forms
of
the
infant
language
have
practically
become
shakespeare
has
not
suffered
by
similar
changes
spencer
has
not
suffered
it
would
be
surprising
if
chaucer
should
suffer
when
the
loss
of
popular
comprehension
and
favour
in
his
case
are
necessarily
all
the
greater
for
his
remoteness
from
our
day
in
a
much
smaller
degree
since
previous
labours
in
the
same
direction
had
left
far
less
to
do
the
same
work
has
been
performed
for
the
spelling
of
spenser
and
the
whole
endeavour
in
this
department
of
the
editor
task
has
been
to
present
a
text
plain
and
easily
intelligible
to
the
modern
reader
without
any
injustice
to
the
old
poet
it
would
be
presumptuous
to
believe
that
in
every
case
both
ends
have
been
achieved
together
but
the
laudatores
temporis
acti
the
students
who
may
differ
most
from
the
plan
pursued
in
this
volume
will
best
appreciate
the
difficulty
of
the
enterprise
and
most
leniently
regard
any
failure
in
the
details
of
its
accomplishment
with
all
the
works
of
chaucer
outside
the
canterbury
tales
it
would
have
been
absolutely
impossible
to
deal
within
the
scope
of
this
volume
but
nearly
one
hundred
pages
have
been
devoted
to
his
minor
poems
and
by
dint
of
careful
selection
and
judicious
abridgement
a
connecting
outline
of
the
story
in
all
such
cases
being
given
the
editor
ventures
to
hope
that
he
has
presented
fair
and
acceptable
specimens
of
workmanship
in
all
styles
the
preparation
of
this
part
of
the
volume
has
been
a
laborious
task
no
similar
attempt
on
the
same
scale
has
been
made
and
while
here
also
the
truth
of
the
text
in
matters
essential
has
been
in
nowise
sacrificed
to
mere
ease
of
perusal
the
general
reader
will
find
opened
up
for
him
a
new
view
of
chaucer
and
his
works
before
a
perusal
of
these
hundred
pages
will
melt
away
for
ever
the
lingering
tradition
or
prejudice
that
chaucer
was
only
or
characteristically
a
coarse
buffoon
who
pandered
to
a
base
and
licentious
appetite
by
painting
and
exaggerating
the
lowest
vices
of
his
time
in
these
selections
made
without
a
thought
of
taking
only
what
is
to
the
poet
credit
from
a
wide
range
of
poems
in
which
hardly
a
word
is
to
his
discredit
we
behold
chaucer
as
he
was
a
courtier
a
gallant
gentleman
a
scholar
a
philosopher
a
poet
of
gay
and
vivid
fancy
playing
around
themes
of
chivalric
convention
of
deep
human
interest
or
satire
in
the
canterbury
tales
we
see
not
chaucer
but
chaucer
times
and
neighbours
the
artist
has
lost
himself
in
his
work
to
show
him
honestly
and
without
disguise
as
he
lived
his
own
life
and
sung
his
own
songs
at
the
brilliant
court
of
edward
iii
is
to
do
his
memory
a
moral
justice
far
more
material
than
any
wrong
that
can
ever
come
out
of
spelling
as
to
the
minor
poems
of
spenser
which
follow
the
faerie
queen
the
choice
has
been
governed
by
the
desire
to
give
at
once
the
most
interesting
and
the
most
characteristic
of
the
poet
several
styles
and
save
in
the
case
of
the
sonnets
the
poems
so
selected
are
given
entire
it
is
manifest
that
the
endeavours
to
adapt
this
volume
for
popular
use
have
been
already
noticed
would
imperfectly
succeed
without
the
aid
of
notes
and
glossary
to
explain
allusions
that
have
become
obsolete
or
antiquated
words
which
it
was
necessary
to
retain
an
endeavour
has
been
made
to
render
each
page
explanatory
by
placing
on
it
all
the
glossarial
and
illustrative
notes
required
for
its
elucidation
or
to
avoid
repetitions
that
would
have
occupied
space
the
references
to
the
spot
where
information
may
be
found
the
great
advantage
of
such
a
plan
to
the
reader
is
the
measure
of
its
difficulty
for
the
editor
it
permits
much
more
flexibility
in
the
choice
of
glossarial
explanations
or
equivalents
it
saves
the
distracting
and
consuming
reference
to
the
end
or
the
beginning
of
the
book
but
at
the
same
time
it
largely
enhances
the
liability
to
error
the
editor
is
conscious
that
in
the
or
notes
as
well
as
in
the
innumerable
minute
points
of
spelling
accentuation
and
rhythm
he
must
now
and
again
be
found
tripping
he
can
only
ask
any
reader
who
may
detect
all
that
he
could
himself
point
out
as
being
amiss
to
set
off
against
inevitable
mistakes
and
misjudgements
the
conscientious
labour
bestowed
on
the
book
and
the
broad
consideration
of
its
fitness
for
the
object
contemplated
from
books
the
editor
has
derived
valuable
help
as

seem
to
be
modelled
on
the
lines
of

painstaking

but
the
coincidences
are
either
inevitable
or

many
of
the

especially
of
those
explaining
classical
references
and
those
attached
to
the
minor
poems
of
chaucer
have
been
prepared
specially
for
this
edition
the
editor
leaves
his
task
with
the
hope
that
his
attempt
to
remove
artificial
obstacles
to
the
popularity
of
earliest
poets
will
not
altogether
miscarry
laing
purves
life
of
geoffrey
chaucer
not
in
point
of
genius
only
but
even
in
point
of
time
chaucer
may
claim
the
proud
designation
of
first
english
poet
he
wrote
the
court
of
love
in
and
the
romaunt
of
the
rose
if
not
also
troilus
and
cressida
probably
within
the
next
decade
the
dates
usually
assigned
to
the
poems
of
laurence
minot
extend
from
to
while
the
vision
of
piers
plowman
mentions
events
that
occurred
in
and
before
which
date
chaucer
had
certainly
written
the
assembly
of
fowls
and
his
dream
but
though
they
were
his
contemporaries
neither
minot
nor
langland
if
langland
was
the
author
of
the
vision
at
all
approached
chaucer
in
the
finish
the
force
or
the
universal
interest
of
their
works
and
the
poems
of
earlier
writer
as
layamon
and
the
author
of
the
ormulum
are
less
english
than
or
norman
those
poems
reflected
the
perplexed
struggle
for
supremacy
between
the
two
grand
elements
of
our
language
which
marked
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
a
struggle
intimately
associated
with
the
political
relations
between
the
conquering
normans
and
the
subjugated
chaucer
found
two
branches
of
the
language
that
spoken
by
the
people
teutonic
in
its
genius
and
its
forms
that
spoken
by
the
learned
and
the
noble
based
on
the
french
yet
each
branch
had
begun
to
borrow
of
the
other
just
as
nobles
and
people
had
been
taught
to
recognise
that
each
needed
the
other
in
the
wars
and
the
social
tasks
of
the
time
and
chaucer
a
scholar
a
courtier
a
man
conversant
with
all
orders
of
society
but
accustomed
to
speak
think
and
write
in
the
words
of
the
highest
by
his
comprehensive
genius
cast
into
the
simmering
mould
a
magical
amalgamant
which
made
the
two
elements
unite
and
interpenetrate
each
other
before
chaucer
wrote
there
were
two
tongues
in
england
keeping
alive
the
feuds
and
resentments
of
cruel
centuries
when
he
laid
down
his
pen
there
was
practically
but
one
speech
there
was
and
ever
since
has
been
but
one
people
geoffrey
chaucer
according
to
the
most
trustworthy
for
authentic
testimonies
on
the
subject
are
wanting
was
born
in
and
london
is
generally
believed
to
have
been
his
it
is
true
that
leland
the
biographer
of
first
great
poet
who
lived
nearest
to
his
time
not
merely
speaks
of
chaucer
as
having
been
born
many
years
later
than
the
date
now
assigned
but
mentions
berkshire
or
oxfordshire
as
the
scene
of
his
birth
so
great
uncertainty
have
some
felt
on
the
latter
score
that
elaborate
parallels
have
been
drawn
between
chaucer
and
homer
for
whose
birthplace
several
cities
contended
and
whose
descent
was
traced
to
the
demigods
leland
may
seem
to
have
had
fair
opportunities
of
getting
at
the
truth
about
chaucer
birth
for
henry
viii
had
him
at
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
throughout
england
to
search
for
records
of
public
interest
the
archives
of
the
religious
houses
but
it
may
be
questioned
whether
he
was
likely
to
find
many
authentic
particulars
regarding
the
personal
history
of
the
poet
in
the
quarters
which
he
explored
and
leland
testimony
seems
to
be
set
aside
by
chaucer
own
evidence
as
to
his
birthplace
and
by
the
contemporary
references
which
make
him
out
an
aged
man
for
years
preceding
the
accepted
date
of
his
death
in
one
of
his
prose
works
the
testament
of
love
the
poet
speaks
of
himself
in
terms
that
strongly
confirm
the
claim
of
london
to
the
honour
of
giving
him
birth
for
he
there
mentions
the
city
of
london
that
is
to
me
so
dear
and
sweet
in
which
i
was
forth
growen
and
more
kindly
love
says
he
have
i
to
that
place
than
to
any
other
in
earth
as
every
kindly
creature
hath
full
appetite
to
that
place
of
his
kindly
engendrure
and
to
will
rest
and
peace
in
that
place
to
abide
this
tolerably
direct
evidence
is
supported
so
far
as
it
can
be
at
such
an
interval
of
time
by
the
learned
camden
in
his
annals
of
queen
elizabeth
he
describes
spencer
who
was
certainly
born
in
london
as
being
a
of
chaucer
edmundus
spenserus
patria
londinensis
musis
adeo
arridentibus
natus
ut
omnes
anglicos
superioris
aevi
poetas
ne
chaucero
quidem
concive
excepto
superaret
the
records
of
the
time
notice
more
than
one
person
of
the
name
of
chaucer
who
held
honourable
positions
about
the
court
and
though
we
can
not
distinctly
trace
the
poet
relationship
with
any
of
these
namesakes
or
antecessors
we
find
excellent
ground
for
belief
that
his
family
or
friends
stood
well
at
court
in
the
ease
with
which
chaucer
made
his
way
there
and
in
his
subsequent
career
like
his
great
successor
spencer
it
was
the
fortune
of
chaucer
to
live
under
a
splendid
chivalrous
and
reign
was
the
second
year
of
edward
iii
and
what
with
scotch
wars
french
expeditions
and
the
strenuous
and
costly
struggle
to
hold
england
in
a
worthy
place
among
the
states
of
europe
there
was
sufficient
bustle
bold
achievement
and
high
ambition
in
the
period
to
inspire
a
poet
who
was
prepared
to
catch
the
spirit
of
the
day
it
was
an
age
of
elaborate
courtesy
of
paced
gallantry
of
courageous
venture
of
noble
disdain
for
mean
tranquillity
and
chaucer
on
the
whole
a
man
of
peaceful
avocations
was
penetrated
to
the
depth
of
his
consciousness
with
the
lofty
and
lovely
civil
side
of
that
brilliant
and
restless
military
period
no
record
of
his
youthful
years
however
remains
to
us
if
we
believe
that
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
was
a
student
of
cambridge
it
is
only
on
the
strength
of
a
reference
in
his
court
of
love
where
the
narrator
is
made
to
say
that
his
name
is
philogenet
of
cambridge
clerk
while
he
had
already
told
us
that
when
he
was
stirred
to
seek
the
court
of
cupid
he
was
at
eighteen
year
of
age
according
to
leland
however
he
was
educated
at
oxford
proceeding
thence
to
france
and
the
netherlands
to
finish
his
studies
but
there
remains
no
certain
evidence
of
his
having
belonged
to
either
university
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
doubted
that
his
family
was
of
good
condition
and
whether
or
not
we
accept
the
assertion
that
his
father
held
the
rank
of
knighthood
rejecting
the
hypotheses
that
make
him
a
merchant
or
a
vintner
at
the
corner
of
kirton
lane
it
is
plain
from
chaucer
whole
career
that
he
had
introductions
to
public
life
and
recommendations
to
courtly
favour
wholly
independent
of
his
genius
we
have
the
clearest
testimony
that
his
mental
training
was
of
wide
range
and
thorough
excellence
altogether
rare
for
a
mere
courtier
in
those
days
his
poems
attest
his
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
divinity
the
philosophy
and
the
scholarship
of
his
time
and
show
him
to
have
had
the
sciences
as
then
developed
and
taught
at
his
fingers
ends
another
proof
of
chaucer
good
birth
and
fortune
would
he
found
in
the
statement
that
after
his
university
career
was
completed
he
entered
the
inner
temple
the
expenses
of
which
could
be
borne
only
by
men
of
noble
and
opulent
families
but
although
there
is
a
story
that
he
was
once
fined
two
shillings
for
thrashing
a
franciscan
friar
in
fleet
street
we
have
no
direct
authority
for
believing
that
the
poet
devoted
himself
to
the
uncongenial
study
of
the
law
no
special
display
of
knowledge
on
that
subject
appears
in
his
works
yet
in
the
sketch
of
the
manciple
in
the
prologue
to
the
canterbury
tales
may
be
found
indications
of
his
familiarity
with
the
internal
economy
of
the
inns
of
court
while
numerous
legal
phrases
and
references
hint
that
his
comprehensive
information
was
not
at
fault
on
legal
matters
leland
says
that
he
quitted
the
university
a
ready
logician
a
smooth
rhetorician
a
pleasant
poet
a
grave
philosopher
an
ingenious
mathematician
and
a
holy
divine
and
by
all
accounts
when
geoffrey
chaucer
comes
before
us
authentically
for
the
first
time
at
the
age
of
he
was
possessed
of
knowledge
and
accomplishments
far
beyond
the
common
standard
of
his
day
chaucer
at
this
period
possessed
also
other
qualities
fitted
to
recommend
him
to
favour
in
a
court
like
that
of
edward
iii
urry
describes
him
on
the
authority
of
a
portrait
as
being
then
of
a
fair
beautiful
complexion
his
lips
red
and
full
his
size
of
a
just
medium
and
his
port
and
air
graceful
and
majestic
so
continues
the
ardent
biographer
so
that
every
ornament
that
could
claim
the
approbation
of
the
great
and
fair
his
abilities
to
record
the
valour
of
the
one
and
celebrate
the
beauty
of
the
other
and
his
wit
and
gentle
behaviour
to
converse
with
both
conspired
to
make
him
a
complete
courtier
if
we
believe
that
his
court
of
love
had
received
such
publicity
as
the
literary
media
of
the
time
allowed
in
the
somewhat
narrow
and
select
literary
world
not
to
speak
of
troilus
and
cressida
which
as
lydgate
mentions
it
first
among
chaucer
works
some
have
supposed
to
be
a
youthful
production
we
find
a
third
and
not
less
powerful
recommendation
to
the
favour
of
the
great
operating
with
his
learning
and
his
gallant
bearing
elsewhere
reasons
have
been
shown
for
doubt
whether
troilus
and
cressida
should
not
be
assigned
to
a
later
period
of
life
but
very
little
is
positively
known
about
the
dates
and
sequence
of
his
various
works
in
the
year
being
called
as
witness
with
regard
to
a
contest
on
a
point
of
heraldry
between
lord
scrope
and
sir
robert
grosvenor
chaucer
deposed
that
he
entered
on
his
military
career
in
in
that
year
edward
iii
invaded
france
for
the
third
time
in
pursuit
of
his
claim
to
the
french
crown
and
we
may
fancy
that
in
describing
the
embarkation
of
the
knights
in
chaucer
dream
the
poet
gained
some
of
the
vividness
and
stir
of
his
picture
from
his
recollections
of
the
embarkation
of
the
splendid
and
appointed
royal
host
at
sandwich
on
board
the
eleven
hundred
transports
provided
for
the
enterprise
in
this
expedition
the
laurels
of
poitiers
were
flung
on
the
ground
after
vainly
attempting
rheims
and
paris
edward
was
constrained
by
cruel
weather
and
lack
of
provisions
to
retreat
toward
his
ships
the
fury
of
the
elements
made
the
retreat
more
disastrous
than
an
overthrow
in
pitched
battle
horses
and
men
perished
by
thousands
or
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
pursuing
french
chaucer
who
had
been
made
prisoner
at
the
siege
of
retters
was
among
the
captives
in
the
possession
of
france
when
the
treaty
of
bretigny
the
great
peace
was
concluded
in
may
returning
to
england
as
we
may
suppose
at
the
peace
the
poet
ere
long
fell
into
another
and
a
pleasanter
captivity
for
his
marriage
is
generally
believed
to
have
taken
place
shortly
after
his
release
from
foreign
durance
he
had
already
gained
the
personal
friendship
and
favour
of
john
of
gaunt
duke
of
lancaster
the
king
son
the
duke
while
earl
of
richmond
had
courted
and
won
to
wife
after
a
certain
delay
blanche
daughter
and
of
henry
duke
of
lancaster
and
chaucer
is
by
some
believed
to
have
written
the
assembly
of
fowls
to
celebrate
the
wooing
as
he
wrote
chaucer
dream
to
celebrate
the
wedding
of
his
patron
the
marriage
took
place
in
the
year
of
chaucer
expedition
to
france
and
as
in
the
assembly
of
fowls
the
formel
or
female
eagle
who
is
supposed
to
represent
the
lady
blanche
begs
that
her
choice
of
a
mate
may
be
deferred
for
a
year
and
have
been
assigned
as
the
respective
dates
of
the
two
poems
already
mentioned
in
the
dream
chaucer
prominently
introduces
his
own
to
whom
after
the
happy
union
of
his
patron
with
the
lady
blanche
he
is
wedded
amid
great
rejoicing
and
various
expressions
in
the
same
poem
show
that
not
only
was
the
poet
high
in
favour
with
the
illustrious
pair
but
that
his
future
wife
had
also
peculiar
claims
on
their
regard
she
was
the
younger
daughter
of
sir
payne
roet
a
native
of
hainault
who
had
like
many
of
his
countrymen
been
attracted
to
england
by
the
example
and
patronage
of
queen
philippa
the
favourite
attendant
on
the
lady
blanche
was
her
elder
sister
katherine
subsequently
married
to
sir
hugh
swynford
a
gentleman
of
lincolnshire
and
destined
after
the
death
of
blanche
to
be
in
succession
governess
of
her
children
mistress
of
john
of
gaunt
and
duchess
of
lancaster
it
is
quite
sufficient
proof
that
chaucer
position
at
court
was
of
no
mean
consequence
to
find
that
his
wife
the
sister
of
the
future
duchess
of
lancaster
was
one
of
the
royal
maids
of
honour
and
even
as
sir
harris
nicolas
conjectures
a
of
the
queen
for
her
name
also
was
philippa
between
when
the
poet
himself
testifies
that
he
was
made
prisoner
while
bearing
arms
in
france
and
september
when
queen
philippa
granted
to
her
former
maid
of
honour
by
the
name
of
philippa
chaucer
a
yearly
pension
of
ten
marks
or
we
have
no
authentic
mention
of
chaucer
express
or
indirect
it
is
plain
from
this
grant
that
the
poet
marriage
with
sir
payne
roet
daughter
was
not
celebrated
later
than
the
probability
is
that
it
closely
followed
his
return
from
the
wars
in
edward
iii
settled
upon
chaucer
a
pension
of
twenty
marks
for
the
good
service
which
our
beloved
valet
valettus
noster
geoffrey
chaucer
has
rendered
and
will
render
in
time
to
come
camden
explains
hospitii
to
signify
a
gentleman
of
the
privy
chamber
selden
says
that
the
designation
was
bestowed
upon
young
heirs
designed
to
he
knighted
or
young
gentlemen
of
great
descent
and
quality
whatever
the
strict
meaning
of
the
word
it
is
plain
that
the
poet
position
was
honourable
and
near
to
the
king
person
and
also
that
his
worldly
circumstances
were
easy
if
not
affluent
for
it
need
not
be
said
that
twenty
marks
in
those
days
represented
twelve
or
twenty
times
the
sum
in
these
it
is
believed
that
he
found
powerful
patronage
not
merely
from
the
duke
of
lancaster
and
his
wife
but
from
margaret
countess
of
pembroke
the
king
daughter
to
her
chaucer
is
supposed
to
have
addressed
the
goodly
ballad
in
which
the
lady
is
celebrated
under
the
image
of
the
daisy
her
he
is
by
some
understood
to
have
represented
under
the
title
of
queen
alcestis
in
the
court
of
love
and
the
prologue
to
the
legend
of
good
women
and
in
her
praise
we
may
read
his
charming
descriptions
and
eulogies
of
the
daisy
french
marguerite
the
name
of
his
royal
patroness
to
this
period
of
chaucer
career
we
may
probably
attribute
the
elegant
and
courtly
if
somewhat
conventional
poems
of
the
flower
and
the
leaf
the
cuckoo
and
the
nightingale
the
lady
margaret
says
urry
would
frequently
compliment
him
upon
his
poems
but
this
is
not
to
be
meant
of
his
canterbury
tales
they
being
written
in
the
latter
part
of
his
life
when
the
courtier
and
the
fine
gentleman
gave
way
to
solid
sense
and
plain
descriptions
in
his
he
was
obliged
to
have
the
strictest
regard
to
modesty
and
decency
the
ladies
at
that
time
insisting
so
much
upon
the
nicest
punctilios
of
honour
that
it
was
highly
criminal
to
depreciate
their
sex
or
do
anything
that
might
offend
virtue
chaucer
in
their
estimation
had
sinned
against
the
dignity
and
honour
of
womankind
by
his
translation
of
the
french
roman
de
la
rose
and
by
his
troilus
and
cressida
assuming
it
to
have
been
among
his
less
mature
works
and
to
atone
for
those
offences
the
lady
margaret
though
other
and
older
accounts
say
that
it
was
the
first
queen
of
richard
anne
of
bohemia
prescribed
to
him
the
task
of
writing
the
legend
of
good
women
see
introductory
note
to
that
poem
about
this
period
too
we
may
place
the
composition
of
chaucer
a
or
the
prayer
of
our
lady
made
at
the
request
of
the
duchess
blanche
a
lady
of
great
devoutness
in
her
private
life
she
died
in
and
chaucer
as
he
had
allegorised
her
wooing
celebrated
her
marriage
and
aided
her
devotions
now
lamented
her
death
in
a
poem
entitled
the
book
of
the
duchess
or
the
death
of
in
chaucer
was
employed
on
the
king
service
abroad
and
in
november
by
the
title
of
scutifer
noster
our
esquire
or
he
was
associated
with
jacobus
pronan
and
johannes
de
mari
civis
januensis
in
a
royal
commission
bestowing
full
powers
to
treat
with
the
duke
of
genoa
his
council
and
state
the
object
of
the
embassy
was
to
negotiate
upon
the
choice
of
an
english
port
at
which
the
genoese
might
form
a
commercial
establishment
and
chaucer
having
quitted
england
in
december
visited
genoa
and
florence
and
returned
to
england
before
the
end
of
november
for
on
that
day
he
drew
his
pension
from
the
exchequer
in
person
the
most
interesting
point
connected
with
this
italian
mission
is
the
question
whether
chaucer
visited
petrarch
at
padua
that
he
did
is
unhesitatingly
affirmed
by
the
old
biographers
but
the
authentic
notices
of
chaucer
during
the
years
as
shown
by
the
researches
of
sir
harris
nicolas
are
confined
to
the
facts
already
stated
and
we
are
left
to
answer
the
question
by
the
probabilities
of
the
case
and
by
the
aid
of
what
faint
light
the
poet
himself
affords
we
can
scarcely
fancy
that
chaucer
visiting
italy
for
the
first
time
in
a
capacity
which
opened
for
him
easy
access
to
the
great
and
the
famous
did
not
embrace
the
chance
of
meeting
a
poet
whose
works
he
evidently
knew
in
their
native
tongue
and
highly
esteemed
with
mr
wright
we
are
strongly
disinclined
to
believe
that
chaucer
did
not
profit
by
the
opportunity
of
improving
his
acquaintance
with
the
poetry
if
not
the
poets
of
the
country
he
thus
visited
whose
influence
was
now
being
felt
on
the
literature
of
most
countries
of
western
europe
that
chaucer
was
familiar
with
the
italian
language
appears
not
merely
from
his
repeated
selection
as
envoy
to
italian
states
but
by
many
passages
in
his
poetry
from
the
assembly
of
fowls
to
the
canterbury
tales
in
the
opening
of
the
first
poem
there
is
a
striking
parallel
to
dante
inscription
on
the
gate
of
hell
the
first
song
of
troilus
in
troilus
and
cressida
is
a
nearly
literal
translation
of
petrarch
sonnet
in
the
prologue
to
the
legend
of
good
women
there
is
a
reference
to
dante
which
can
hardly
have
reached
the
poet
at
hand
and
in
chaucer
great
work
as
in
the
wife
of
bath
tale
and
the
monk
tale
direct
reference
by
name
is
made
to
dante
the
wise
poet
of
florence
the
great
poet
of
italy
as
the
source
whence
the
author
has
quoted
when
we
consider
the
poet
high
place
in
literature
and
at
court
which
could
not
fail
to
make
him
free
of
the
hospitalities
of
the
brilliant
little
lombard
states
his
familiarity
with
the
tongue
and
the
works
of
italy
greatest
bards
dead
and
living
the
reverential
regard
which
he
paid
to
the
memory
of
great
poets
of
which
we
have
examples
in
the
house
of
fame
and
at
the
close
of
troilus
and
cressida
along
with
his
own
testimony
in
the
prologue
to
the
clerk
tale
we
can
not
fail
to
construe
that
testimony
as
a
declaration
that
the
tale
was
actually
told
to
chaucer
by
the
lips
of
petrarch
in
the
very
year
in
which
petrarch
translated
it
into
latin
from
boccaccio
decameron
mr
bell
notes
the
objection
to
this
interpretation
that
the
words
are
put
into
the
mouth
not
of
the
poet
but
of
the
clerk
and
meets
it
by
the
objection
that
the
clerk
being
a
purely
imaginary
personage
could
not
have
learned
the
story
at
padua
from
petrarch
and
therefore
that
chaucer
must
have
departed
from
the
dramatic
assumption
maintained
in
the
rest
of
the
dialogue
instances
could
be
adduced
from
chaucer
writings
to
show
that
such
a
sudden
departure
from
the
dramatic
assumption
would
not
be
unexampled
witness
the
aside
in
the
wife
of
prologue
where
after
the
jolly
dame
has
asserted
that
half
so
boldly
there
can
no
man
swear
and
lie
as
a
woman
can
the
poet
hastens
to
interpose
in
his
own
person
these
two
lines
i
say
not
this
by
wives
that
be
wise
but
if
it
be
when
they
them
misadvise
and
again
in
the
prologue
to
the
legend
of
good
women
from
a
description
of
the
daisy
she
is
the
clearness
and
the
very
light
that
in
this
darke
world
me
guides
and
leads
the
poet
in
the
very
next
lines
slides
into
an
address
to
his
lady
the
heart
within
my
sorrowful
heart
you
dreads
and
loves
so
sore
that
ye
be
verily
the
mistress
of
my
wit
and
nothing
i
when
therefore
the
clerk
of
oxford
is
made
to
say
that
he
will
tell
a
tale
the
which
that
i
learn
at
padova
of
a
worthy
clerk
as
proved
by
his
wordes
and
his
werk
he
is
now
dead
and
nailed
in
his
chest
i
pray
to
god
to
give
his
soul
good
rest
francis
petrarc
the
laureate
poete
highte
this
clerk
whose
rhetoric
so
sweet
illumin
all
itaile
of
poetry
but
forth
to
tellen
of
this
worthy
man
that
taughte
me
this
tale
as
i
began
we
may
without
violent
effort
believe
that
chaucer
speaks
in
his
own
person
though
dramatically
the
words
are
on
the
lips
and
the
belief
is
not
impaired
by
the
sorrowful
way
in
which
the
clerk
lingers
on
petrarch
death
which
would
be
less
intelligible
if
the
fictitious
narrator
had
only
read
the
story
in
the
latin
translation
than
if
we
suppose
the
news
of
petrarch
death
at
arqua
in
july
to
have
closely
followed
chaucer
to
england
and
to
have
cruelly
and
irresistibly
mingled
itself
with
our
poet
personal
recollections
of
his
great
italian
contemporary
nor
must
we
regard
as
without
significance
the
manner
in
which
the
clerk
is
made
to
distinguish
between
the
body
of
petrarch
tale
and
the
fashion
in
which
it
was
set
forth
in
writing
with
a
proem
that
seemed
a
thing
impertinent
save
that
the
poet
had
chosen
in
that
way
to
convey
his
matter
told
or
taught
so
much
more
directly
and
simply
by
word
of
mouth
it
is
impossible
to
pronounce
positively
on
the
subject
the
question
whether
chaucer
saw
petrarch
in
must
remain
a
so
long
as
we
have
only
our
present
information
but
fancy
loves
to
dwell
on
the
thought
of
the
two
poets
conversing
under
the
vines
at
arqua
and
we
find
in
the
history
and
the
writings
of
chaucer
nothing
to
contradict
a
good
deal
to
countenance
the
belief
that
such
a
meeting
occurred
though
we
have
no
express
record
we
have
indirect
testimony
that
chaucer
genoese
mission
was
discharged
satisfactorily
for
on
the
of
april
edward
iii
grants
at
windsor
to
the
poet
by
the
title
of
our
beloved
squire
dilecto
armigero
nostro
unum
pycher
vini
one
pitcher
of
wine
daily
to
be
perceived
in
the
port
of
london
a
grant
which
on
the
analogy
of
more
modern
usage
might
he
held
equivalent
to
chaucer
appointment
as
poet
laureate
when
we
find
that
soon
afterwards
the
grant
was
commuted
for
a
money
payment
of
twenty
marks
per
annum
we
need
not
conclude
that
chaucer
circumstances
were
poor
for
it
may
be
easily
supposed
that
the
daily
perception
of
such
an
article
of
income
was
attended
with
considerable
prosaic
inconvenience
a
permanent
provision
for
chaucer
was
made
on
the
of
june
when
he
was
appointed
controller
of
the
customs
in
the
port
of
london
for
the
lucrative
imports
of
wools
skins
or
and
tanned
hides
on
condition
that
he
should
fulfil
the
duties
of
that
office
in
person
and
not
by
deputy
and
should
write
out
the
accounts
with
his
own
hand
we
have
what
seems
evidence
of
chaucer
compliance
with
these
terms
in
the
house
of
fame
where
in
the
mouth
of
the
eagle
the
poet
describes
himself
when
he
has
finished
his
labour
and
made
his
reckonings
as
not
seeking
rest
and
news
in
social
intercourse
but
going
home
to
his
own
house
and
there
all
so
dumb
as
any
stone
sitting
at
another
book
until
his
look
is
dazed
and
again
in
the
record
that
in
he
received
a
grant
of
the
amount
of
a
fine
levied
on
one
john
kent
whom
chaucer
vigilance
had
frustrated
in
the
attempt
to
ship
a
quantity
of
wool
for
dordrecht
without
paying
the
duty
the
seemingly
derogatory
condition
that
the
controller
should
write
out
the
accounts
or
rolls
rotulos
of
his
office
with
his
own
hand
appears
to
have
been
designed
or
treated
as
merely
formal
no
records
in
chaucer
handwriting
are
known
to
exist
which
could
hardly
be
the
case
if
for
the
twelve
years
of
his
controllership
he
had
duly
complied
with
the
condition
and
during
that
period
he
was
more
than
once
employed
abroad
so
that
the
condition
was
evidently
regarded
as
a
formality
even
by
those
who
had
imposed
it
also
in
the
duke
of
lancaster
whose
ambitious
views
may
well
have
made
him
anxious
to
retain
the
adhesion
of
a
man
so
capable
and
accomplished
as
chaucer
changed
into
a
joint
remaining
to
the
survivor
and
charged
on
the
revenues
of
the
savoy
a
pension
of
which
two
years
before
he
settled
on
the
poet
wife
whose
sister
was
then
the
governess
of
the
duke
two
daughters
philippa
and
elizabeth
and
the
own
mistress
another
proof
of
chaucer
personal
reputation
and
high
court
favour
at
this
time
is
his
selection
as
ward
to
the
son
of
sir
edmond
staplegate
of
bilsynton
in
kent
a
charge
on
the
surrender
of
which
the
guardian
received
no
less
a
sum
than
we
find
chaucer
in
again
employed
on
a
foreign
mission
in
the
last
year
of
edward
he
was
sent
to
flanders
with
sir
thomas
percy
afterwards
earl
of
worcester
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
prolongation
of
the
truce
and
in
january
he
was
associated
with
sir
guichard
and
other
commissioners
to
pursue
certain
negotiations
for
a
marriage
between
princess
mary
of
france
and
the
young
king
richard
which
had
been
set
on
foot
before
the
death
of
edward
iii
the
negotiation
however
proved
fruitless
and
in
may
chaucer
was
selected
to
accompany
sir
john
berkeley
on
a
mission
to
the
court
of
bernardo
visconti
duke
of
milan
with
the
view
it
is
supposed
of
concerting
military
plans
against
the
outbreak
of
war
with
france
the
new
king
meantime
had
shown
that
he
was
not
insensible
to
chaucer
merit
or
to
the
influence
of
his
tutor
and
the
poet
patron
the
duke
of
lancaster
for
richard
ii
confirmed
to
chaucer
his
pension
of
twenty
marks
along
with
an
equal
annual
sum
for
which
the
daily
pitcher
of
wine
granted
in
had
been
commuted
before
his
departure
for
lombardy
chaucer
still
holding
his
post
in
the
customs
selected
two
representatives
or
trustees
to
protect
his
estate
against
legal
proceedings
in
his
absence
or
to
sue
in
his
name
defaulters
and
offenders
against
the
imposts
which
he
was
charged
to
enforce
one
of
these
trustees
was
called
richard
forrester
the
other
was
john
gower
the
poet
the
most
famous
english
contemporary
of
chaucer
with
whom
he
had
for
many
years
been
on
terms
of
admiring
friendship
although
from
the
strictures
passed
on
certain
productions
of
gower
in
the
prologue
to
the
man
of
law
tale
it
has
been
supposed
that
in
the
later
years
of
chaucer
life
the
friendship
suffered
some
diminution
to
the
moral
gower
and
the
philosophical
strode
chaucer
directed
or
dedicated
his
troilus
and
cressida
while
in
the
confessio
amantis
gower
introduces
a
handsome
compliment
to
his
greater
contemporary
as
the
disciple
and
the
poet
of
venus
with
whose
glad
songs
and
ditties
made
in
her
praise
during
the
flowers
of
his
youth
the
land
was
filled
everywhere
gower
however
a
monk
and
a
conservative
held
to
the
party
of
the
duke
of
gloucester
the
rival
of
the
wycliffite
and
innovating
duke
of
lancaster
who
was
chaucer
patron
and
whose
cause
was
not
a
little
aided
by
chaucer
strictures
on
the
clergy
and
thus
it
is
not
impossible
that
political
differences
may
have
weakened
the
old
bonds
of
personal
friendship
and
poetic
esteem
returning
from
lombardy
early
in
chaucer
seems
to
have
been
again
sent
abroad
for
the
records
exhibit
no
trace
of
him
between
may
and
december
of
that
year
whether
by
proxy
or
in
person
however
he
received
his
pensions
regularly
until
when
his
income
was
increased
by
his
appointment
to
the
post
of
controller
of
petty
customs
in
the
port
of
london
in
november
he
obtained
a
month
leave
of
absence
on
account
of
his
private
affairs
and
a
deputy
was
appointed
to
fill
his
place
and
in
february
of
the
next
year
he
was
permitted
to
appoint
a
permanent
deputy
thus
at
length
gaining
relief
from
that
close
attention
to
business
which
probably
curtailed
the
poetic
fruits
of
the
poet
most
powerful
years
chaucer
is
next
found
occupying
a
post
which
has
not
often
been
held
by
men
gifted
with
his
peculiar
genius
that
of
a
county
member
the
contest
between
the
dukes
of
gloucester
and
lancaster
and
their
adherents
for
the
control
of
the
government
was
coming
to
a
crisis
and
when
the
recluse
and
studious
chaucer
was
induced
to
offer
himself
to
the
electors
of
kent
as
one
of
the
knights
of
their
shire
where
presumably
he
held
property
we
may
suppose
that
it
was
with
the
view
of
supporting
his
patron
cause
in
the
impending
conflict
the
parliament
in
which
the
poet
sat
assembled
at
westminster
on
the
of
october
and
was
dissolved
on
the
of
november
lancaster
was
fighting
and
intriguing
abroad
absorbed
in
the
affairs
of
his
castilian
succession
gloucester
and
his
friends
at
home
had
everything
their
own
way
the
earl
of
suffolk
was
dismissed
from
the
woolsack
and
impeached
by
the
commons
and
although
richard
at
first
stood
out
courageously
for
the
friends
of
his
uncle
lancaster
he
was
constrained
by
the
refusal
of
supplies
to
consent
to
the
proceedings
of
gloucester
a
commission
was
wrung
from
him
under
protest
appointing
gloucester
arundel
and
twelve
other
peers
and
prelates
a
permanent
council
to
inquire
into
the
condition
of
all
the
public
departments
the
courts
of
law
and
the
royal
household
with
absolute
powers
of
redress
and
dismissal
we
need
not
ascribe
to
chaucer
parliamentary
exertions
in
his
patron
behalf
nor
to
any
malpractices
in
his
official
conduct
the
fact
that
he
was
among
the
earliest
victims
of
the
in
december
he
was
dismissed
from
both
his
offices
in
the
port
of
london
but
he
retained
his
pensions
and
drew
them
regularly
twice
a
year
at
the
exchequer
until
in
political
reverses
were
aggravated
by
a
severe
domestic
calamity
his
wife
died
and
with
her
died
the
pension
which
had
been
settled
on
her
by
queen
philippa
in
and
confirmed
to
her
at
richard
accession
in
the
change
made
in
chaucer
pecuniary
position
by
the
loss
of
his
offices
and
his
wife
pension
must
have
been
very
great
it
would
appear
that
during
his
prosperous
times
he
had
lived
in
a
style
quite
equal
to
his
income
and
had
no
ample
resources
against
a
season
of
reverse
for
on
the
of
may
less
than
a
year
and
a
half
after
being
dismissed
from
the
customs
he
was
constrained
to
assign
his
pensions
by
surrender
in
chancery
to
one
john
scalby
in
may
richard
now
of
age
abruptly
resumed
the
reins
of
government
which
for
more
than
two
years
had
been
ably
but
cruelly
managed
by
gloucester
the
friends
of
lancaster
were
once
more
supreme
in
the
royal
councils
and
chaucer
speedily
profited
by
the
change
on
the
of
july
he
was
appointed
clerk
of
the
king
works
at
the
palace
of
westminster
the
tower
the
royal
manors
of
kennington
eltham
clarendon
sheen

of

in
the

in
the
parks
of
clarendon
childern
langley
and
feckenham
and
the
mews
for
the
king
falcons
at
charing
cross
he
received
a
salary
of
two
shillings
per
day
and
was
allowed
to
perform
the
duties
by
deputy
for
some
reason
unknown
chaucer
held
this
lucrative
office
little
more
than
two
years
quitting
it
before
the
of
september
at
which
date
it
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
one
john
gedney
the
next
two
years
and
a
half
are
a
blank
so
far
as
authentic
records
are
concerned
chaucer
is
supposed
to
have
passed
them
in
retirement
probably
devoting
them
principally
to
the
composition
of
the
canterbury
tales
in
february
the
king
conferred
upon
him
a
grant
of
a
year
for
life
but
he
seems
to
have
had
no
other
source
of
income
and
to
have
become
embarrassed
by
debt
for
frequent
memoranda
of
small
advances
on
his
pension
show
that
his
circumstances
were
in
comparison
greatly
reduced
things
appear
to
have
grown
worse
and
worse
with
the
poet
for
in
may
he
was
compelled
to
obtain
from
the
king
letters
of
protection
against

at

concerning
his
personal
appearance
and
habits
chaucer
has
not
been
reticent
in
his
poetry
urry
sums
up
the
traits
of
his
aspect
and
character
fairly
thus
he
was
of
a
middle
stature
the
latter
part
of
his
life
inclinable
to
be
fat
and
corpulent
as
appears
by
the
host
bantering
him
in
the
journey
to
canterbury
and
comparing
shapes
with
his
face
was
fleshy
his
features
just
and
regular
his
complexion
fair
and
somewhat
pale
his
hair
of
a
dusky
yellow
short
and
thin
the
hair
of
his
beard
in
two
forked
tufts
of
a
wheat
colour
his
forehead
broad
and
smooth
his
eyes
inclining
usually
to
the
ground
which
is
intimated
by
the
host
words
his
whole
face
full
of
liveliness
a
calm
easy
sweetness
and
a
studious
venerable
aspect
as
to
his
temper
he
had
a
mixture
of
the
gay
the
modest
and
the
grave
the
sprightliness
of
his
humour
was
more
distinguished
by
his
writings
than
by
his
appearance
which
gave
occasion
to
margaret
countess
of
pembroke
often
to
rally
him
upon
his
silent
modesty
in
company
telling
him
that
his
absence
was
more
agreeable
to
her
than
his
conversation
since
the
first
was
productive
of
agreeable
pieces
of
wit
in
his
writings
but
the
latter
was
filled
with
a
modest
deference
and
a
too
distant
respect
we
see
nothing
merry
or
jocose
in
his
behaviour
with
his
pilgrims
but
a
silent
attention
to
their
mirth
rather
than
any
mixture
of
his
own
when
disengaged
from
public
affairs
his
time
was
entirely
spent
in
study
and
reading
so
agreeable
to
him
was
this
exercise
that
he
says
he
preferred
it
to
all
other
sports
and
he
lived
within
himself
neither
desirous
to
hear
nor
busy
to
concern
himself
with
the
affairs
of
his
neighbours
his
course
of
living
was
temperate
and
regular
he
went
to
rest
with
the
sun
and
rose
before
it
and
by
that
means
enjoyed
the
pleasures
of
the
better
part
of
the
day
his
morning
walk
and
fresh
contemplations
this
gave
him
the
advantage
of
describing
the
morning
in
so
lively
a
manner
as
he
does
everywhere
in
his
works
the
springing
sun
glows
warm
in
his
lines
and
the
fragrant
air
blows
cool
in
his
descriptions
we
smell
the
sweets
of
the
bloomy
haws
and
hear
the
music
of
the
feathered
choir
whenever
we
take
a
forest
walk
with
him
the
hour
of
the
day
is
not
easier
to
be
discovered
from
the
reflection
of
the
sun
in
titian
paintings
than
in
chaucer
morning
landscapes
his
reading
was
deep
and
extensive
his
judgement
sound
and
discerning
in
one
word
he
was
a
great
scholar
a
pleasant
wit
a
candid
critic
a
sociable
companion
a
steadfast
friend
a
grave
philosopher
a
temperate
economist
and
a
pious
christian
chaucer
most
important
poems
are
troilus
and
cressida
the
romaunt
of

and
the
canterbury
tales
of
the
first
containing
lines
an
abridgement
with
a
prose
connecting
outline
of
the
story
is
given
in
this
volume
with
the
second
consisting
of
octosyllabic
verses
like
those
in
which
the
house
of
fame
is
written
it
was
found
impossible
to
deal
in
the
present
edition
the
poem
is
a
curtailed
translation
from
the
french
roman
de
la
rose
commenced
by
guillaume
de
lorris
who
died
in
after
contributing
verses
and
completed
in
the
last
quarter
of
the
thirteenth
century
by
jean
de
meun
who
added
some
verses
it
is
a
satirical
allegory
in
which
the
vices
of
courts
the
corruptions
of
the
clergy
the
disorders
and
inequalities
of
society
in
general
are
unsparingly
attacked
and
the
most
revolutionary
doctrines
are
advanced
and
though
in
making
his
translation
chaucer
softened
or
eliminated
much
of
the
satire
of
the
poem
still
it
remained
in
his
verse
a
caustic
exposure
of
the
abuses
of
the
time
especially
those
which
discredited
the
church
the
canterbury
tales
are
presented
in
this
edition
with
as
near
an
approach
to
completeness
as
regard
for
the
popular
character
of
the
volume
permitted
the
verses
of
which
the
poetical
tales
consist
have
been
given
without
abridgement
or
purgation
save
in
a
single
couplet
but
the
main
purpose
of
the
volume
being
to
make
the
general
reader
acquainted
with
the
poems
of
chaucer
and
spenser
the
editor
has
ventured
to
contract
the
two
prose
tales
chaucer
tale
of
meliboeus
and
the
parson
sermon
or
treatise
on
penitence
so
as
to
save
about
thirty
pages
for
the
introduction
of
chaucer
minor
pieces
at
the
same
time
by
giving
prose
outlines
of
the
omitted
parts
it
has
been
sought
to
guard
the
reader
against
the
fear
that
he
was
losing
anything
essential
or
even
valuable
it
is
almost
needless
to
describe
the
plot
or
point
out
the
literary
place
of
the
canterbury
tales
perhaps
in
the
entire
range
of
ancient
and
modern
literature
there
is
no
work
that
so
clearly
and
freshly
paints
for
future
times
the
picture
of
the
past
certainly
no
englishman
has
ever
approached
chaucer
in
the
power
of
fixing
for
ever
the
fleeting
traits
of
his
own
time
the
plan
of
the
poem
had
been
adopted
before
chaucer
chose
it
notably
in
the
decameron
of
boccaccio
although
there
the
circumstances
under
which
the
tales
were
told
with
the
terror
of
the
plague
hanging
over
the
merry
company
lend
a
grim
grotesqueness
to
the
narrative
unless
we
can
look
at
it
abstracted
from
its
setting
chaucer
on
the
other
hand
strikes
a
perpetual
of
gaiety
whenever
he
mentions
the
word
pilgrimage
and
at
every
stage
of
the
connecting
story
we
bless
the
happy
thought
which
gives
us
incessant
incident
movement
variety
and
unclouded
but
never
monotonous
joyousness
the
poet
the
evening
before
he
starts
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
shrine
of
st
thomas
at
canterbury
lies
at
the
tabard
inn
in
southwark
curious
to
know
in
what
companionship
he
is
destined
to
fare
forward
on
the
morrow
chance
sends
him
nine
and
twenty
in
a
company
representing
all
orders
of
english
society
lay
and
clerical
from
the
knight
and
the
abbot
down
to
the
ploughman
and
the
sompnour
the
jolly
host
of
the
tabard
after
supper
when
tongues
are
loosened
and
hearts
are
opened
declares
that
not
this
year
has
he
seen
such
a
company
at
once
under
his
and
proposes
that
when
they
set
out
next
morning
he
should
ride
with
them
and
make
them
sport
all
agree
and
harry
bailly
unfolds
his
scheme
each
pilgrim
including
the
poet
shall
tell
two
tales
on
the
road
to
canterbury
and
two
on
the
way
back
to
london
and
he
whom
the
general
voice
pronounces
to
have
told
the
best
tale
shall
be
treated
to
a
supper
at
the
common
cost
and
of
course
to
mine
host
profit
when
the
cavalcade
returns
from
the
shrine
to
the
southwark
hostelry
all
joyously
assent
and
early
on
the
morrow
in
the
gay
spring
sunshine
they
ride
forth
listening
to
the
heroic
tale
of
the
brave
and
gentle
knight
who
has
been
gracefully
chosen
by
the
host
to
lead
the
spirited
competition
of
to
describe
thus
the
nature
of
the
plan
and
to
say
that
when
chaucer
conceived
or
at
least
began
to
execute
it
he
was
between
sixty
and
seventy
years
of
age
is
to
proclaim
that
the
canterbury
tales
could
never
be
more
than
a
fragment
thirty
pilgrims
each
telling
two
tales
on
the
way
out
and
two
more
on
the
way
back
that
makes
tales
to
say
nothing
of
the
prologue
the
description
of
the
journey
the
occurrences
at
canterbury
and
all
the
remnant
of
their
pilgrimage
which
chaucer
also
undertook
no
more
than
of
the
stories
are
told
in
the
work
as
it
comes
down
to
us
that
is
only
of
the
thirty
pilgrims
tell
the
first
of
the
two
stories
on
the
road
to
canterbury
while
of
the
stories
on
the
return
journey
we
have
not
one
and
nothing
is
said
about
the
doings
of
the
pilgrims
at
canterbury
which
would
if
treated
like
the
scene
at
the
tabard
have
given
us
a
still
livelier
picture
of
the
period
but
the
plan
was
too
large
and
although
the
poet
had
some
reserves
in
stories
which
he
had
already
composed
in
an
independent
form
death
cut
short
his
labour
ere
he
could
even
complete
the
arrangement
and
connection
of
more
than
a
very
few
of
the
tales
incomplete
as
it
is
however
the
magnum
opus
of
chaucer
was
in
his
own
time
received
with
immense
favour
manuscript
copies
are
numerous
even
now
no
slight
proof
of
its
popularity
and
when
the
invention
of
printing
was
introduced
into
england
by
william
caxton
the
canterbury
tales
issued
from
his
press
in
the
year
after
the
first
printed
book
the
game
of
the
chesse
had
been
struck
off
innumerable
editions
have
since
been
published
and
it
may
fairly
be
affirmed
that
few
books
have
been
so
much
in
favour
with
the
reading
public
of
every
generation
as
this
book
which
the
lapse
of
every
generation
has
been
rendering
more
unreadable
apart
from
the
romaunt
of
the
rose
no
really
important
poetical
work
of
chaucer
is
omitted
from
or
unrepresented
in
the
present
edition
of
the
legend
of
good
women
the
prologue
only
is
given
but
it
is
the
most
genuinely
chaucerian
part
of
the
poem
of
the
court
of
love
are
here
presented
of
the
assembly
of
fowls
the
cuckoo
and
the
nightingale
the
flower
and
the
leaf
all
of

of
the
house
of
fame
and
of
the
minor
poems
such
a
selection
as
may
give
an
idea
of
chaucer
power
in
the
occasional
department
of
verse
necessarily
no
space
whatever
could
be
given
to
prose
works
his
translation
of
boethius
treatise
on
the
consolation
of
philosophy
his
treatise
on
the
astrolabe
written
for
the
use
of
his
son
lewis
and
his
testament
of
love
composed
in
his
later
years
and
reflecting
the
troubles
that
then
beset
the
poet
if
after
studying
in
a
simplified
form
the
salient
works
of
england
first
great
bard
the
reader
is
tempted
to
regret
that
he
was
not
introduced
to
a
wider
acquaintance
with
the
author
the
purpose
of
the
editor
will
have
been
more
than
attained
the
plan
of
the
volume
does
not
demand
an
elaborate
examination
into
the
state
of
our
language
when
chaucer
wrote
or
the
nice
questions
of
grammatical
and
metrical
structure
which
conspire
with
the
obsolete
orthography
to
make
his
poems
a
sealed
book
for
the
masses
the
most
important
element
in
the
proper
reading
of
chaucer
verses
whether
written
in
the
decasyllabic
or
heroic
metre
which
he
introduced
into
our
literature
or
in
the
octosyllabic
measure
used
with
such
animated
effect
in
the
house
of
fame
chaucer
dream
is
the
sounding
of
the
terminal
e
where
it
is
now
silent
that
letter
is
still
valid
in
french
poetry
and
chaucer
lines
can
be
scanned
only
by
reading
them
as
we
would
read
racine
or
moliere
the
terminal
e
played
an
important
part
in
grammar
in
many
cases
it
was
the
sign
of
the
infinitive
the
n
being
dropped
from
the
end
at
other
times
it
pointed
the
distinction
between
singular
and
plural
between
adjective
and
adverb
the
pages
that
follow
however
being
prepared
from
the
modern
english
point
of
view
necessarily
no
account
is
taken
of
those
distinctions
and
the
now
silent
e
has
been
retained
in
the
text
of
chaucer
only
when
required
by
the
modern
spelling
or
by
the
exigencies
of
metre
before
a
word
beginning
with
a
vowel
or
with
the
letter
h
the
final
e
was
almost
without
exception
mute
and
in
such
cases
in
the
plural
forms
and
infinitives
of
verbs
the
terminal
n
is
generally
retained
for
the
sake
of
euphony
no
reader
who
is
acquainted
with
the
french
language
will
find
it
hard
to
fall
into
chaucer
accentuation
while
for
such
as
are
not
a
simple
perusal
of
the
text
according
to
the
rules
of
modern
verse
should
remove
every
difficulty
notes
to
life
of
geoffrey
chaucer
edmund
spenser
a
native
of
london
was
born
with
a
muse
of
such
power
that
he
was
superior
to
all
english
poets
of
preceding
ages
not
excepting
his
chaucer
see
introduction
to
the
legend
of
good
women
called
in
the
editions
before
the
dream
of
chaucer
the
poem
which
is
not
included
in
the
present
edition
does
indeed
like
many
of
chaucer
smaller
works
tell
the
story
of
a
dream
in
which
a
knight
representing
john
of
gaunt
is
found
by
the
poet
mourning
the
loss
of
his
lady
but
the
true
dream
of
chaucer
in
which
he
celebrates
the
marriage
of
his
patron
was
published
for
the
first
time
by
speght

a
powerful
confirmation
of
the
opinion
that
this
poem
was
really
produced
in
chaucer
mature
age
see
the
introductory
notes
to
it
and
to
the
legend
of
good
women
the
old
biographers
of
chaucer
founding
on
what
they
took
to
be
autobiographic
allusions
in
the
testament
of
love
assign
to
him
between
and
a
very
different
history
from
that
here
given
on
the
strength
of
authentic
records
explored
and
quoted
by
sir
nicolas
chaucer
is
made
to
espouse
the
cause
of
john
of
northampton
the
wycliffite
lord
mayor
of
london
whose
in
was
so
vehemently
opposed
by
the
clergy
and
who
was
imprisoned
in
the
sequel
of
the
grave
disorders
that
arose
the
poet
it
is
said
fled
to
the
continent
taking
with
him
a
large
sum
of
money
which
he
spent
in
supporting
companions
in
exile
then
returning
by
stealth
to
england
in
quest
of
funds
he
was
detected
and
sent
to
the
tower
where
he
languished
for
three
years
being
released
only
on
the
humiliating
condition
of
informing
against
his
associates
in
the
plot
the
public
records
show
however
that
all
the
time
of
his
alleged
exile
and
captivity
he
was
quietly
living
in
london
regularly
drawing
his
pensions
in
person
sitting
in
parliament
and
discharging
his
duties
in
the
customs
until
his
dismissal
in
it
need
not
be
said
further
that
although
chaucer
freely
handled
the
errors
the
ignorance
and
vices
of
the
clergy
he
did
so
rather
as
a
man
of
sense
and
of
conscience
than
as
a
wycliffite
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
espoused
the
opinions
of
the
zealous
reformer
far
less
played
the
part
of
an
extreme
and
regardless
partisan
of
his
old
friend
and
the
commissioners
appear
to
have
commenced
their
labours
with
examining
the
accounts
of
the
officers
employed
in
the
collection
of
the
revenue
and
the
sequel
affords
a
strong
presumption
that
the
royal
administration
under
lancaster
and
his
friends
had
been
foully
calumniated
we
hear
not
of
any
frauds
discovered
or
of
defaulters
punished
or
of
grievances
redressed
such
is
the
testimony
of
lingard
chap
all
the
more
valuable
for
his
aversion
from
the
wycliffite
leanings
of
john
of
gaunt
chaucer
department
in
the
london
customs
was
in
those
days
one
of
the
most
important
and
lucrative
in
the
kingdom
and
if
mercenary
abuse
of
his
post
could
have
been
proved
we
may
be
sure
that
his
and
his
patron
enemies
would
not
have
been
content
with
simple
dismissal
but
would
have
heavily
amerced
or
imprisoned
him
the
salary

able
full

a

when

hear
jingeling

this
is
to
say
a
monk
out
of
his
cloister
this
ilke
text
held
he
not

i

his

always
pore

there

that
rounded
was
as

withal
but
sooth
to
say
i
how
men
him
call
not
a

there
was
of
also
that
unto
logic
hadde
long
himself
as
leane
was

and
he
was
not
right
fat
i

thereto
full
threadbare

gotten
him
yet
no

took

more
than

that
was
said
in
form
and
reverence
and
short
and
quick
and
full
of
high
sentence
sounding
in
moral
virtue
was
his
speech

if
that
a

when
that

of
the

arcita
to
look
where
as
this

her
beauty

him
so
that
if
that
palamon

as
much
as

evermo
then
had
i
been
in

and
not

only
the
sight
of
her
whom
that
i
serve
though
that
i
never
may
her

deserve
would
have
sufficed
right
enough
for
me
o

palamon
quoth
he
thine
is
the
of
this
aventure
full
blissfully
in

to
endure
in

nay
certes
in

well
hath
fortune
thee
the
dice
that

the
sight
of

and
i
th
absence
for
possible
is
since
thou
hast
her
presence
and
art
a
knight
a
worthy
and
an
able
that
by
some
since
fortune
is
changeable
thou
to
thy
desire
sometime
attain
but
i
that
am
exiled
and
barren
of
alle
grace
and
in
so
great
despair
that
there
earthe
water
fire
nor
air
nor
creature
that
of
them
maked
is
that
may
me
helpe
nor
comfort
in
this
well
ought
i
in
and
distress
in
farewell
my
life
my
and
my
gladness
alas
plainen
men
so
in
commune
do
men
so
often
complain
of
purveyance
of
or
of
fortune
of
god
providence
that
giveth
them
full
oft
in
many
a
guise
well
better
than
they
can
themselves
devise
some
man
desireth
for
to
have
richess
that
cause
is
of
his
murder
or
great
sickness
and
some
man
would
out
of
his
prison
fain
that
in
his
house
is
of
his
slain
infinite
harmes
be
in
this
mattere
we
wot
never
what
thing
we
pray
for
here
we
fare
as
he
that
drunk
is
as
a
mouse
a
drunken
man
wot
well
he
hath
an
house
but
he
wot
not
which
is
the
right
way
thither
and
to
a
drunken
man
the
way
is
and
certes
in
this
world
so
fare
we
we
seeke
fast
after
felicity
but
we
go
wrong
full
often
truely
thus
we
may
sayen
all
and
i
that
and
had
a
great
opinion
that
if
i
might
escape
from
prison
then
had
i
been
in
joy
and
perfect
heal
where
now
i
am
exiled
from
my
weal
since
that
i
may
not
see
you
emily
i
am
but
dead
there
is
no
remedy
upon
that
other
side
palamon
when
that
he
wist
arcita
was
agone
much
sorrow
maketh
that
the
greate
tower
resounded
of
his
yelling
and
clamour
the
fetters
on
his
shinnes
great
were
of
his
bitter
salte
teares
wet
alas
quoth
he
arcita
cousin
mine
of
all
our
strife
god
wot
the
fruit
is
thine
thou
walkest
now
in
thebes
at
thy
large
and
of
my
woe
thou
little
little
thou
mayst
since
thou
hast
wisdom
and
courage
assemble
all
the
folk
of
our
kindred
and
make
a
war
so
sharp
on
this
country
that
by
some
aventure
or
some
treaty
thou
mayst
have
her
to
lady
and
to
wife
for
whom
that
i
must
needes
lose
my
life
for
as
by
way
of
possibility
since
thou
art
at
thy
large
of
prison
free
and
art
a
lord
great
is
thine
avantage
more
than
is
mine
that
sterve
here
in
a
cage
for
i
must
weep
and
wail
while
that
i
live
with
all
the
woe
that
prison
may
me
give
and
eke
with
pain
that
love
me
gives
also
that
doubles
all
my
torment
and
my
woe
therewith
the
fire
of
jealousy
upstart
within
his
breast
and
him
by
the
heart
so
that
he
like
was
to
behold
the
or
the
ashes
dead
and
cold
then
said
o
cruel
goddess
that
govern
this
world
with
binding
of
your
word
and
writen
in
the
table
of
adamant
your
and
your
eternal
grant
what
is
mankind
more
you
you
esteemed
than
is
the
sheep
that
in
the
fold
huddled
together
for
slain
is
man
right
as
another
beast
and
dwelleth
eke
in
prison
and
arrest
and
hath
sickness
and
great
adversity
and
oftentimes
guilteless
god
what
governance
is
in
your
prescience
that
guilteless
tormenteth
innocence
and
yet
increaseth
this
all
my
penance
that
man
is
bounden
to
his
observance
for
godde
sake
to
of
his
his
whereas
a
beast
may
all
his
lust
fulfil
and
when
a
beast
is
dead
he
hath
no
pain
but
man
after
his
death
must
weep
and
plain
though
in
this
worlde
he
have
care
and
woe
withoute
doubt
it
maye
standen
so
the
answer
of
this
leave
i
to
divines
but
well
i
wot
that
in
this
world
great
is
trouble
alas
i
see
a
serpent
or
a
thief
that
many
a
true
man
hath
done
mischief
go
at
his
large
and
where
him
list
may
turn
but
i
must
be
in
prison
through
saturn
and
eke
through
juno
jealous
and
eke
that
hath
well
nigh
destroyed
all
the
blood
of
thebes
with
his
waste
walles
wide
and
venus
me
on
that
other
side
for
jealousy
and
fear
of
him
arcite
now
will
i
of
palamon
a
and
let
him
in
his
prison
stille
dwell
and
of
arcita
forth
i
will
you
tell
the
summer
passeth
and
the
nightes
long
increase
the
paines
strong
both
of
the
lover
and
the
prisonere
i
which
hath
the
wofuller
not
for
shortly
for
to
say
this
palamon
perpetually
is
damned
to
prison
in
chaines
and
in
fetters
to
be
dead
and
arcite
is
exiled
his
peril
of
his
for
evermore
as
out
of
that
country
nor
never
more
he
shall
his
lady
see
you
lovers
ask
i
now
this
question
who
lieth
the
worse
arcite
or
palamon
the
one
may
see
his
lady
day
by
day
but
in
prison
he
dwelle
must
alway
the
other
where
him
list
may
ride
or
go
but
see
his
lady
shall
he
never
mo
now
deem
all
as
you
liste
ye
that
can
for
i
will
tell
you
forth
as
i
began
when
that
arcite
to
thebes
comen
was
full
oft
a
day
he
and
said
alas
for
see
this
lady
he
shall
never
mo
and
shortly
to
concluden
all
his
woe
so
much
sorrow
had
never
creature
that
is
or
shall
be
while
the
world
may
dure
his
sleep
his
meat
his
drink
is
away
from
that
lean
he
and
dry
as
any
shaft
his
eyen
hollow
grisly
to
behold
his
hue
sallow
and
pale
as
ashes
cold
and
solitary
he
was
ever
alone
and
wailing
all
the
night
making
his
moan
and
if
he
hearde
song
or
instrument
then
would
he
weepen
he
might
not
be
so
feeble
were
his
spirits
and
so
low
and
changed
so
that
no
man
coulde
know
his
speech
neither
his
voice
though
men
it
heard
and
in
his
for
all
the
world
he
far
not
only
like
the
lovers
malady
of
eros
but
rather
engender
of
humours
melancholic
before
his
head
in
his
cell
and
shortly
turned
was
all
upside
down
both
habit
and
eke
dispositioun
of
him
this
woful
lover
arcite
why
should
i
all
day
of
his
woe
indite
when
he
endured
had
a
year
or
two
this
cruel
torment
and
this
pain
and
woe
at
thebes
in
his
country
as
i
said
upon
a
night
in
sleep
as
he
him
laid
him
thought
how
that
the
winged
god
mercury
before
him
stood
and
bade
him
to
be
merry
his
sleepy
in
hand
he
bare
upright
a
hat
he
wore
upon
his
haires
bright
arrayed
was
this
god
as
he
took
as
he
was
when
that
argus
took
his
sleep
and
said
him
thus
to
athens
shalt
thou
there
is
thee
of
thy
woe
an
end
prepared
and
with
that
word
arcite
woke
and
start
now
truely
how
sore
that
me
smart
quoth
he
to
athens
right
now
will
i
fare
nor
for
no
dread
of
death
shall
i
not
spare
to
see
my
lady
that
i
love
and
serve
in
her
presence
recke
not
to
sterve
not
care
if
i
and
with
that
word
he
caught
a
great
mirror
and
saw
that
changed
was
all
his
colour
and
saw
his
visage
all
in
other
kind
and
right
anon
it
ran
him
ill
his
mind
that
since
his
face
was
so
of
malady
the
which
he
had
endur
he
mighte
well
if
that
he
him
low
in
lowly
live
in
athenes
evermore
unknow
and
see
his
lady
wellnigh
day
by
day
and
right
anon
he
changed
his
array
and
clad
him
as
a
poore
labourer
and
all
alone
save
only
a
squier
that
knew
his
and
all
his
which
was
disguised
poorly
as
he
was
to
athens
is
he
gone
the
way
and
to
the
court
he
went
upon
a
day
and
at
the
gate
he
proffer
his
service
to
drudge
and
draw
what
so
men
would
and
shortly
of
this
matter
for
to
sayn
he
fell
in
office
with
a
chamberlain
the
which
that
dwelling
was
with
emily
for
he
was
wise
and
coulde
soon
espy
of
every
servant
which
that
served
her
well
could
he
hewe
wood
and
water
bear
for
he
was
young
and
mighty
for
the
and
thereto
he
was
strong
and
big
of
bones
to
do
that
any
wight

bright
and
philostrate
he
saide
that
he
hight
but
half
so
well
belov
a
man
as
he
ne
was
there
never
in
court
of
his
degree
he
was
so
gentle
of
conditioun
that
throughout
all
the
court
was
his
renown
they
saide
that
it
were
a
charity
that
theseus
would
his
him
in
and
put
him
in
some
worshipful
service
there
as
he
might
his
virtue
exercise
and
thus
within
a
while
his
name
sprung
both
of
his
deedes
and
of
his
good
tongue
that
theseus
hath
taken
him
so
near
that
of
his
chamber
he
hath
made
him
squire
and
gave
him
gold
to
maintain
his
degree
and
eke
men
brought
him
out
of
his
country
from
year
to
year
full
privily
his
rent
but
honestly
and
he
it
spent
prudently
that
no
man
wonder
how
that
he
it
had
and
three
year
in
this
wise
his
life
be
and
bare
him
so
in
peace
and
eke
in
there
was
no
man
that
theseus
had
so
and
in
this
blisse
leave
i
now
arcite
and
speak
i
will
of
palamon
a
in
darkness
horrible
and
strong
prison
this
seven
year
hath
sitten
palamon
what
for
love
and
for
distress
wasted
away
who
feeleth
double
sorrow
and
heaviness
but
palamon
that
love
so
that
out
of
his
wits
he
went
for
woe
and
eke
thereto
he
is
a
prisonere
perpetual
not
only
for
a
year
who
coulde
rhyme
in
english
properly
his
martyrdom
it
is
not
i
therefore
i
pass
as
lightly
as
i
may
it
fell
that
in
the
seventh
year
in
may
the
thirde
night
as
olde
bookes
sayn
that
all
this
story
tellen
more
plain
were
it
by
a
venture
or
destiny
as
when
a
thing
is
it
shall
be
decreed
that
soon
after
the
midnight
palamon
by
helping
of
a
friend
brake
his
prison
and
fled
the
city
fast
as
he
might
go
for
he
had
given
drink
his
gaoler
so
of
a
clary
made
of
a
certain
wine
with
and
of
thebes
fine
and
that
all
the
night
though
that
men
would
him
shake
the
gaoler
slept
he
mighte
not
awake
and
thus
he
fled
as
fast
as
ever
he
may
the
night
was
short
and
by
the
day
at
hand
was
that
needes
cast
he
must
himself
to
the
day
during
which
and
to
a
grove
faste
there
beside
he
must
cast
about
or
contrive
with
dreadful
foot
then
stalked
palamon
to
conceal
himself
for
shortly
this
was
his
opinion
that
in
the
grove
he
would
him
hide
all
day
and
in
the
night
then
would
he
take
his
way
to
his
friendes
for
to
pray
on
theseus
to
help
him
to
war
and
shortly
either
he
would
lose
his
life
or
winnen
emily
unto
his
wife
this
is
th
effect
and
his
intention
plain
now
will
i
turn
to
arcita
again
that
little
wist
how
nighe
was
his
care
till
that
fortune
had
brought
him
in
the
snare
the
busy
lark
the
messenger
of
day
saluteth
in
her
song
the
morning
gray
and
fiery
phoebus
riseth
up
so
bright
that
all
the
orient
laugheth
at
the
sight
and
with
his
drieth
in
the
the
silver
droppes
hanging
on
the
leaves
and
arcite
that
is
in
the
court
royal
with
theseus
his
squier
principal
is
and
looketh
on
the
merry
day
and
for
to
do
his
observance
to
may
remembering
the
of
his
desire
he
on
his
courser
starting
as
the
fire
is
ridden
to
the
fieldes
him
to
play
out
of
the
court
were
it
a
mile
or
tway
and
to
the
grove
of
which
i
have
you
told
by
a
venture
his
way
began
to
hold
to
make
him
a
garland
of
the
were
it
of
woodbine
or
of
hawthorn
leaves
and
loud
he
sang
against
the
sun
so
bright
o
may
with
all
thy
flowers
and
thy
green
right
welcome
be
thou
faire
freshe
may
i
hope
that
i
some
green
here
getten
may
and
from
his
with
a
lusty
heart
into
the
grove
full
hastily
he
start
and
in
a
path
he
roamed
up
and
down
there
as
by
aventure
this
palamon
was
in
a
bush
that
no
man
might
him
see
for
sore
afeard
of
his
death
was
he
nothing
ne
knew
he
that
it
was
arcite
god

he
would
have
it
full
little
believed
but

at
time
full
little
wot
arcite
of
his
fellaw
that
was
so
nigh
to
hearken
of
his
speech
for
in
the
bush
he
sitteth
now
full
still
when
that
arcite
had
roamed
all
his
fill
and
all
the
lustily
the
into
a
study
he
fell
suddenly
as

womanhead
began
to
weep
and
so
did
emily
and
all
the
ladies
in
the
company
great
pity
was
it
as
it
thought
them
all
that
ever
such
a
chance
should
befall
for
gentle
men
they
were
of
great
estate
and
nothing
but
for
love
was
this
debate
they
saw
their
bloody
woundes
wide
and
sore
and
cried
all
at
once
both
less
and
more
have
mercy
lord
upon
us
women
all
and
on
their
bare
knees
adown
they
fall
and
would
have
kissed
his
feet
there
as
he
stood
till
at
the
last
was
his
anger
was
for
pity
runneth
soon
in
gentle
heart
and
though
at
first
for
ire
he
quoke
and
start
he
hath
consider
shortly
in
a
clause
the
trespass
of
them
both
and
eke
the
cause
and
although
that
his
ire
their
guilt
accused
yet
in
his
reason
he
them
both
excused
as
thus
he
thoughte
well
that
every
man
will
help
himself
in
love
if
that
he
can
and
eke
deliver
himself
out
of
prison
of
women
for
they
wepten
and
eke
his
hearte
had
compassion
and
in
his
gentle
heart
he
thought
anon
and
soft
unto
himself
he
saide
fie
upon
a
lord
that
will
have
no
mercy
but
be
a
lion
both
in
word
and
deed
to
them
that
be
in
repentance
and
dread
as
well
a
proud
man
that
will
maintaine
what
he
first
began
that
lord
hath
little
of
discretion
that
in
such
case
no
make
no
but
weigheth
pride
and
humbless
and
shortly
when
his
ire
is
thus
agone
he
gan
to
look
on
them
with
eyen
and
spake
these
same
wordes
on
height
the
god
of
love
ah
ye
him
how
mighty
and
how
great
a
lord
is
he
against
his
might
there
none
obstacles
conquer
he
may
be
called
a
god
for
his
miracles
for
he
can
maken
at
his
owen
guise
of
every
heart
as
that
him
list
devise
lo
here
this
arcite
and
this
palamon
that
quietly
were
out
of
my
prison
and
might
have
lived
in
thebes
royally
and
i
am
their
mortal
enemy
and
that
their
death
in
my
might
also
and
yet
hath
love
their
eyen
spite
of
their
them
hither
bothe
for
to
die
now
look
ye
is
not
this
an
high
folly
who
may
not
be
a
fool
if
but
he
love
behold
for
godde
sake
that
sits
above
see
how
they
bleed
be
they
not
well
array
thus
hath
their
lord
the
god
of
love
them
paid
their
wages
and
their
fees
for
their
service
and
yet
they
weene
for
to
be
full
wise
that
serve
love
for
aught
that
may
befall
but
this
is
yet
the
beste
of
all
that
she
for
whom
they
have
this
jealousy
can
them
therefor
as
muchel
thank
as
me
she
wot
no
more
of
all
this
by
god
than
wot
a
cuckoo
or
an
hare
but
all
must
be
assayed
hot
or
cold
a
man
must
be
a
fool
or
young
or
old
i
wot
it
by
myself
yore
years
for
in
my
time
a
servant
was
i
one
and
therefore
since
i
know
of
love
pain
and
wot
how
sore
it
can
a
man
as
he
that
oft
hath
been
caught
in
his
i
you
forgive
wholly
this
trespass
at
request
of
the
queen
that
kneeleth
here
and
eke
of
emily
my
sister
dear
and
ye
shall
both
anon
unto
me
swear
that
never
more
ye
shall
my
country
nor
make
war
upon
me
night
nor
day
but
be
my
friends
in
alle
that
ye
may
i
you
forgive
this
trespass
and
they
him
sware
fair
and
well
he
and
him
of
lordship
and
of
mercy
pray
and
he
them
granted
grace
and
thus
he
said
to
speak
of
royal
lineage
and
richess
though
that
she
were
a
queen
or
a
princess
each
of
you
both
is
worthy
doubteless
to
wedde
when
time
is
but
natheless
i
speak
as
for
my
sister
emily
for
whom
ye
have
this
strife
and
jealousy
ye
yourselves
she
may
not
wed
the
two
at
once
although
ye
fight
for
evermo
but
one
of
you
be
him
loth
or
lief
or
not
he
he
must
pipe
into
an
ivy
go
whistle
this
is
to
say
she
may
not
have
you
both
all
be
ye
never
so
jealous
nor
so
wroth
and
therefore
i
you
put
in
this
degree
that
each
of
you
shall
have
his
destiny
as
is
and
hearken
in
what
wise
is
decreed
for
lo
hear
your
end
of
that
i
shall
devise
my
will
is
this
for
plain
conclusion
withouten
any
if
that
you
liketh
take
it
for
the
best
that
evereach
of
you
shall
go
where

freely
without

and
this
day
fifty
weekes

an
hundred
knights

all
ready
to

this
i
you
withoute
fail
upon
my
troth
and
as
i
am
a
knight
that
whether
of
you
bothe
that
hath
might
that
is
to
say
that
whether
he
or
thou
may
with
his
hundred
as
i
spake
of
now
slay
his
contrary
or
out
of
listes
drive
him
shall
i
given
emily
to
wive
to
whom
that
fortune
gives
so
fair
a
grace
the
listes
shall
i
make
here
in
this
place
god
so
wisly
on
my
soule
god
as
surely
have
as
i
shall
even
judge
be
and
true
mercy
on
my
ye
shall
none

ende
with
me
maken
than
one
of
you
shalle
be
dead
or
taken
and
if
you
thinketh
this
is
well
say
your
and
hold
yourselves
this
is
your
end
and
your
conclusion
who
looketh
lightly
now
but
palamon
who
springeth
up
for
joye
but
arcite
who
could
it
tell
or
who
could
it
indite
the
joye
that
is
maked
in
the
place
when
theseus
hath
done
so
fair
a
grace
but
down
on
knees
went
every
of
and
thanked
him
with
all
their
heartes
might
and
these
thebans
and
thus
with
good
hope
and
with
hearte
blithe
they
take
their
leave
and
homeward
gan
they
ride
to
with
his
old
walles
wide
i
trow
men
woulde
deem
it
negligence
if
i
forgot
to
telle
the
of
theseus
that
went
so
busily
to
maken
up
the
listes
royally
that
such
a
noble
theatre
as
it
was
i
dare
well
say
in
all
this
world
there
not
the
circuit
a
mile
was
about
walled
of
stone
and
ditched
all
without
was
the
shape
in
manner
of
compass
full
of
degrees
the
height
of
sixty
note
that
when
a
man
was
set
on
one
degree
he
not
his
fellow
for
to
see
eastward
there
stood
a
gate
of
marble
white
westward
right
such
another
opposite
and
shortly
to
conclude
such
a
place
was
never
on
earth
made
in
so
little
space
for
in
the
land
there
was
no
that
geometry
or
nor
nor
carver
of
images
painter
that
theseus
ne
gave
him
meat
and
wages
the
theatre
to
make
and
to
devise
and
for
to
do
his
rite
and
sacrifice
he
eastward
hath
upon
the
gate
above
in
worship
of
venus
goddess
of
love
an
altar
and
an
oratory
to
be
and
westward
in
the
mind
and
in
memory
of
mars
he
maked
hath
right
such
another
that
coste
largely
of
gold
a
great
amount
and
northward
in
a
turret
on
the
wall
of
alabaster
white
and
red
coral
an
oratory
riche
for
to
see
in
worship
of
diane
of
chastity
hath
theseus
done
work
in
noble
wise
but
yet
had
i
forgotten
to
the
noble
carving
and
the
portraitures
the
shape
the
countenance
of
the
figures
that
weren
in
there
oratories
three
first
in
the
temple
of
venus
thou
see
wrought
on
the
wall
full
piteous
to
behold
the
broken
sleepes
and
the
cold
the
sacred
teares
and
the
the
fiery
strokes
of
the
desirings
that
love
servants
in
this
life
endure
the
oathes
that
their
covenants
assure
pleasance
and
hope
desire
foolhardiness
beauty
and
youth
and
bawdry
and
richess
charms
and
and
flattery
dispence
business
and
jealousy
that
wore
of
yellow
a
garland
and
had
a
cuckoo
sitting
on
her
hand
feasts
instruments
and
caroles
and
dances
lust
and
array
and
all
the
circumstances
of
love
which
i
reckon
and
reckon
shall
in
order
were
painted
on
the
wall
and
more
than
i
can
make
of
mention
for
soothly
all
the
mount
of
citheron
where
venus
hath
her
principal
dwelling
was
showed
on
the
wall
in
pourtraying
with
all
the
garden
and
the
nor
was
forgot
the
porter
idleness
nor
narcissus
the
fair
of
nor
yet
the
folly
of
king
solomon
nor
yet
the
greate
strength
of
hercules
th
enchantments
of
medea
and
circes
nor
of
turnus
the
hardy
fierce
courage
the
rich
croesus
in

into
thus
may
ye
see
that
wisdom
nor
richess
beauty
nor
sleight
nor
strength
nor
hardiness
ne
may
with
venus
holde
possession
for
as
her

lo
all
these
folk
so
caught
were
in
her
till
they
for
woe
full
often
said
alas
suffice
these
ensamples
one
or
two
although
i
could
reckon
a
thousand

the
statue
of

glorious
to
see
was
naked
floating
in
the
large
sea
and
from
the

down
all

with
waves
green

bright
as

on

full
seemly
for

blind
he
was

it
is
often
seen
a
bow

bright
and
keen
why
should
i
not
as
well
eke
tell
you
all
the
portraiture
that
was
upon
the
wall
within
the
temple
of
mighty
mars
the
red

painted
was
the
wall
in

and
like
to
the
of
the
grisly
place

that
hight
the
great
temple
of
mars
in
thrace
in
cold
and
frosty
region
there
as
mars
hath
his
sovereign
mansion
in
which
there
dwelled
neither
man
nor
beast
with
knotty
barren
trees
old
of
stubbes
sharp
and
hideous
to
behold
in
which
there
ran
a
rumble
and
a
noise
as
though
a
storm
should
bursten
every
bough
and
downward
from
an
hill
under

stood
the
temple
of

armipotent

steel
of
which
th

was
long

strait
and
ghastly

for
to

of

with
her
was
turned
from
a

made
the
star
thus
was
it
painted
i
can
say
no
her
son

and
at

end
outran
anon
as

aghast
was

shortly
to
the
point
now
will
i
and
maken
of
my
longe
tale
an
end
by
process
and
by
length
of
certain
years
all
is
the
mourning
and
the
tears
of
greekes
by
one
general
assent
then
seemed
me
there
was
a
parlement
at
athens
upon
certain
points
and
amonge
the
which
points
was
to
have
with
certain
countries
alliance
and
have
of
thebans
full
obeisance
for
which
this
noble
theseus
anon
send
after
the
gentle
palamon
of
him
what
was
the
cause
and
why
but
in
his
blacke
clothes
sorrowfully
he
came
at
his
commandment
then
sente
theseus
for
emily
when
they
were
and
hush
was
all
the
place
and
theseus
had
a
space
ere
any
word
came
from
his
wise
breast
eyen
set
he
there
as
was
his
cast
his
eyes
and
with
a
sad
visage
he
sighed
still
wherever
he
and
after
that
right
thus
he
said
his
will
the
firste
mover
of
the
cause
above
when
he
first
made
the
faire
chain
of
love
great
was
th
effect
and
high
was
his
intent
well
wist
he
why
and
what
thereof
he
meant
for
with
that
faire
chain
of
love
he
the
fire
the
air
the
water
and
the
lond
in
certain
bondes
that
they
may
not
flee
that
same
prince
and
mover
eke
quoth
he
hath
stablish
in
this
wretched
world
adown
certain
of
dayes
and
duration
to
all
that
are
engender
in
this
place
over
the
whiche
day
they
may
not
all
may
they
yet
their
dayes
well
abridge
there
needeth
no
authority
to
allege
for
it
is
proved
by
experience
but
that
me
list
declare
my
then
may
men
by
this
order
well
discern
that
mover
stable
is
and
etern
same
well
may
men
know
but
that
it
be
a
fool
that
every
part
deriveth
from
its
whole
for
nature
hath
not
its
beginning
of
no
nor
of
a
thing
or
but
of
a
thing
that
perfect
is
and
stable
descending
so
till
it
be
corruptable
and
therefore
of
his
wise
he
hath
so
well
his
ordinance
that
species
of
things
and
progressions
shallen
endure
by
successions
and
not
etern
withouten
any
lie
this
mayst
thou
understand
and
see
at
eye
lo
th
oak
that
hath
so
long
a
nourishing
from
the
time
that
it
first
to
spring
and
hath
so
long
a
life
as
ye
may
see
yet
at
the
last
is
the
tree
consider
eke
how
that
the
harde
stone
under
our
feet
on
which
we
tread
and
yet
wasteth
as
it
lieth
by
the
way
the
broade
river
some
time
waxeth
the
greate
townes
see
we
wane
and
disappear
then
may
ye
see
that
all
things
have
an
end
of
man
and
woman
see
we
well
also
that
needes
in
one
of
the
termes
two
that
is
to
say
in
youth
or
else
in
age
he
must
be
dead
the
king
as
shall
a
page
some
in
his
bed
some
in
the
deepe
sea
some
in
the
large
field
as
ye
may
see
there
helpeth
nought
all
go
that
way
then
may
i
say
that
alle
thing
must
die
what
maketh
this
but
jupiter
the
king
the
which
is
prince
and
cause
of
alle
thing
converting
all
unto
his
proper
will
from
which
it
is
derived
sooth
to
tell
and
hereagainst
no
creature
alive
of
no
degree
availeth
for
to
strive
then
is
it
wisdom
as
it
thinketh
me
to
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
take
it
well
that
we
may
not
and
namely
what
to
us
all
is
due
and
whoso
ought
he
doth
folly
at
and
rebel
is
to
him
that
all
may
guide
and
certainly
a
man
hath
most
honour
to
dien
in
his
excellence
and
flower
when
he
is
of
his
goode
name
then
hath
he
done
his
friend
nor
no
shame
and
gladder
ought
his
friend
be
of
his
death
when
with
honour
is
yielded
up
his
breath
than
when
his
name
is
for
by
old
for
all
forgotten
is
his
service
then
is
it
best
as
for
a
worthy
fame
to
dien
when
a
man
is
best
of
name
the
contrary
of
all
this
is
wilfulness
why
grudge
we
why
have
we
heaviness
that
good
arcite
of
chivalry
the
flower
departed
is
with
duty
and
honour
out
of
this
foule
prison
of
this
life
why
grudge
here
his
cousin
and
his
wife
of
his
welfare
that
loved
him
so
well
can
he
them
thank
nay
god
wot
a
jot
that
both
his
soul
and
eke
themselves
and
yet
they
may
their
not
what
may
i
conclude
of
this
longe
of
remarks
but
after
sorrow
i
us
to
be
merry
and
thanke
jupiter
for
all
his
grace
and
ere
that
we
departe
from

i
rede
that
we
make
of

one
perfect

look
now
where
most

is
herein
there
will
i
first
amenden

is
my
full

upon
him
pity
and
take
him
for
your
husband
and
your

lend
me
your

for
this
is
our
accord
now
of
your

since

hath
served

year
and
had
for
you
so
great
adversity
it
muste
be
considered
for
gentle
mercy
to
passen
to
be
rightly
then
said
he
thus
to
palamon
the
knight
i
trow
there
needeth
little
sermoning
to
make
you
assente
to
this
thing
come
near
and
take
your

by

betwixte
them
was
made
anon

of

emily
him
loves
so

her
serveth
all
so
gentilly
that
never
was

of

notes
to
the
knight
tale
for
the
plan
and
principal
incidents
of
the
knight
tale
chaucer
was
indebted
to
boccaccio
who
had
himself
borrowed
from
some
prior
poet
chronicler
or
romancer
boccaccio
speaks
of
the
story
as
very
ancient
and
though
that
may
not
be
proof
of
its
antiquity
it
certainly
shows
that
he
took
it
from
an
earlier
writer
the
tale
is
more
or
less
a
paraphrase
of
boccaccio
theseida
but
in
some
points
the
copy
has
a
distinct
dramatic
superiority
over
the
original
the
theseida
contained
ten
thousand
lines
chaucer
has
condensed
it
into
less
than
of
the
number
the
knight
tale
is
supposed
to
have
been
at
first
composed
as
a
separate
work
it
is
undetermined
whether
chaucer
took
it
direct
from
the
italian
of
boccaccio
or
from
a
french
translation

saying
of
the
old
scholar
boethius
in
his
treatise
de

chaucer
translated
and
from
which
he
has
freely
borrowed
in
his
poetry
the

are

pronounced
as
words

three
syllables
respectively

vowels

not
being
diphthongated

enunciated

if

or

or
if

asked
him
what

all
this

was
called

handsome
of

he
knew
and
of

and
therewith
he
was
sly
and
full
privy
and
like
a
maiden
meek
for
to
see
a
chamber
had
he
in
that
hostelry
alone
withouten
any
company
full
with
herbes
and
he
himself
was
sweet
as

made

so
sweetely
that
all

he
sang
and
after
that
he
sung

full

thus
this

his
time
spent
after

his

to
his

and
providing
for
the
cost
of

this

had
wedded

that
he
loved
more
than

of
eighteen
year
i
guess
she
was
of
age
jealous
he
was
and
held
her
in

for
she
was
wild
and
young
and
he
was
old

deemed
himself

well
in
his
chaffare
for
oftentime
he
found
his
box
full
bare
for
soothely
a
prentice
revellour
that
haunteth
dice
riot
and
paramour
his
master
shall
it
in
his
shop
for
have
he
no
part
of
the
minstrelsy
for
theft
and
riot
they
be
convertible
all
can
they
play
on
or
ribible
or
revel
and
truth
as
in
a
low
degree
they
be
full
all
day
as
men
may
see
variance
this
jolly
prentice
with
his
master
bode
till
he
was
nigh
out
of
his
prenticehood
all
were
he
both
early
and
late
and
sometimes
led
with
revel
to
newgate
but
at
the
last
his
master
him
bethought
upon
a
day
when
he
his
paper
sought
of
a
proverb
that
saith
this
same
word
better
is
rotten
apple
out
of
hoard
than
that
it
should
rot
all
the
remenant
so
fares
it
by
a
riotous
servant
it
is
well
lesse
harm
to
let
him
go
than
he
all
the
servants
in
the
place
therefore
his
master
gave
him
a
quittance
and
bade
him
go
with
sorrow
and
mischance
and
thus
this
jolly
prentice
had
his
now
let
him
riot
all
the
night
or
and
for
there
is
no
thief
without
a
louke
that
helpeth
him
to
wasten
and
to
of
that
he
can
or
borrow
may
anon
he
sent
his
bed
and
his
array
unto
a
of
his
owen
sort
that
loved
dice
and
riot
and
disport
and
had
a
wife
that
held
a
shop
and
for
her
sustenance
herself
notes
to
the
cook
tale
cheapside
where
jousts
were
sometimes
held
and
which
was
the
great
scene
of
city
revels
and
processions
his
paper
his
certificate
of
completion
of
his
apprenticeship
louke
the
precise
meaning
of
the
word
is
unknown
but
it
is
doubtless
included
in
the
cant
term
pal
the
cook
tale
is
unfinished
in
all
the
manuscripts
but
in
some
of
minor
authority
the
cook
is
made
to
break
off
his
tale
because
it
is
so
foul
and
to
tell
the
story
of
gamelyn
on
which
shakespeare
as
you
like
it
is
founded
the
story
is
not
chaucer
and
is
different
in
metre
and
inferior
in
composition
to
the
tales
it
is
supposed
that
chaucer
expunged
the
cook
tale
for
the
same
reason
that
made
him
on
his
bed
lament
that
he
had
written
so
much
ribaldry
the
man
of
law
tale
the
prologue
our
hoste
saw
well
that
the
brighte
sun
th
arc
of
his
artificial
day
had
run
the
fourthe
part
and
half
an
houre
more
and
though
he
were
not
deep
expert
in
lore
he
wist
it
was
the
day
of
april
that
is
messenger
to
may
and
saw
well
that
the
shadow
of
every
tree
was
in
its
length
of
the
same
quantity
that
was
the
body
erect
that
caused
it
and
therefore
by
the
shadow
he
took
his
that
phoebus
which
that
shone
so
clear
and
bright
degrees
was
clomb
on
height
and
for
that
day
as
in
that
latitude
it
was
ten
of

gan

suddenly
he
his

of

how
that
the
cursed

antiochus
bereft
his
daughter
of
her
maidenhead
that
is
so
horrible
a
tale
to
read
when
he
her
threw

therefore
he
full
would
never
write
in

of

abominations
nor
i
will
none
rehearse
if
that
i

of

this

me
were
loth

i
recke

though
i
come

him
with
i
speak
in

and
let
him
rhymes
make
and
with
that
word
he
with
a
sober
cheer
began
his

and
said
as
ye
shall
hear
notes
to

plight
pulled
the

an
obsolete

a
proverbial
saying
which
however
had
obtained
fresh
point
from
the
tale
to
which
the
host
doubtless
refers
de

jeo

by

i
agree
it
is
characteristic
that
the
somewhat
pompous
sergeant
of
law
should
couch
his
assent
in
the
french
then
familiar
in
law
procedure
ceyx
and
alcyon
chaucer
treats
of
these
in
the
introduction
to
the
poem
called

relates
to
the
death
of

of

and
afterwards
his
connexion

the

now
called
the

the
names
of
eight
ladies
mentioned
here
are
not
in

as
it
has
come
down
to
us
while
those
of
two
ladies
in
the
legend
cleopatra
and
philomela
are
her
omitted
not
the
muses
who
had
their
surname
from
the
place
near
mount
olympus
where
the
thracians
first
worshipped
them
but
the
nine
daughters
of
pierus
king
of
macedonia
whom
he
called
the
nine
muses
and
who
being
conquered
in
a

with
the
genuine

were
changed

lout
the
common
proverbial
phrase
to
put
a
rogue
above
a

may
throw
light
on
the
reading
here
which
is
difficult
the

of

be
fathers
of
tidings
and
tales
both
of
peace
and
of
war
i
were
right
now
of
tales
empty
but
that
a
merchant
gone
in
many
a
year
me
taught
a
tale
which
ye
shall
after
hear
in
syria
whilom
dwelt
a
company
of
chapmen
rich
and
thereto
and
true
steadfast
clothes
of
gold
and
satins
rich
of
hue
that
sent
their
spicery
distant
parts
their
was
so
and
so
new
that
every
wight
had
to
with
them
and
eke
to
selle
them
their
ware
now
fell
it
that
the
masters
of
that
sort
have
to
rome
for
to
wend
were
it
for
or
for
disport
none
other
message
would
they
thither
send
but
come
themselves
to
rome
this
is
the
end
and
in
such
place
as
thought
them
a
vantage
for
their
intent
they
took
their
herbergage
sojourned
have
these
merchants
in
that
town
a
certain
time
as
fell
to
their
pleasance
and
so
befell
that
th
excellent
renown
of
th
emperore
daughter
dame
constance
reported
was
with
every
circumstance
unto
these
syrian
merchants
in
such
wise
from
day
to
day
as
i
shall
you
this
was
the
common
voice
of
every
man
our
emperor
of
rome
god
him
on
with
favour
a
daughter
hath
that
since
the
the
world
began
to
reckon
as
well
her
goodness
and
beauty
was
never
such
another
as
is
she
i
pray
to
god
in
honour
her
and
would
she
were
of
all
europe
the
queen
in
her
is
highe
beauty
without
pride
and
youth
withoute
or
folly
immaturity
to
all
her
workes
virtue
is
her
guide
humbless
hath
slain
in
her
all
tyranny
she
is
the
mirror
of
all
courtesy
her
heart
a
very
chamber
of
holiness
her
hand
minister
of
freedom
for
and
all
this
voice
was
sooth
as
god
is
true
but
now
to
let
us
turn
again
tale
these
merchants
have
done
freight
their
shippes
new
and
when
they
have
this
blissful
maiden
seen
home
to
syria
then
they
went
full
fain
and
did
their
as
they
have
done
yore
and
liv
in
i
can
you
say
no
more
now
fell
it
that
these
merchants
stood
in
of
him
that
was
the
of
syrie
for
when
they
came
from
any
strange
place
he
would
of
his
benigne
courtesy
make
them
good
cheer
and
busily
tidings
of
sundry
for
to
the
wonders
that
they
mighte
see
or
hear
amonges
other
thinges
specially
these
merchants
have
him
told
of
dame
constance
so
great
nobless
in
earnest
so
royally
that
this
soudan
hath
caught
so
great
to
have
her
figure
in
his
remembrance
that
all
his
and
all
his
busy
was
for
to
love
her
while
his
life
may
dure
paraventure
in
large
book
which
that
men
call
the
heaven
was
with
starres
when
that
he
his
birthe
took
that
he
for
love
should
have
his
death
alas
for
in
the
starres
clearer
than
is
glass
is
written
god
wot
whoso
could
it
read
the
death
of
every
man
withoute
dread
in
starres
many
a
winter
therebeforn
was
writ
the
death
of
hector
achilles
of
pompey
julius
ere
they
were
born
the
strife
of
thebes
and
of
hercules
of
samson
turnus
and
of
socrates
the
death
but
mennes
wittes
be
so
dull
that
no
wight
can
well
read
it
at
the
full
this
soudan
for
his
privy
council
sent
and
of
this
matter
for
to
pass
briefly
he
hath
to
them
declared
his
intent
and
told
them
certain
he
might
have
grace
to
have
constance
within
a
little
space
he
was
but
dead
and
charged
them
in
to
for
his
life
some
remedy
diverse
men
diverse
thinges
said
and
arguments
they
casten
up
and
down
many
a
subtle
reason
forth
they
laid
they
speak
of
magic
and
but
finally
as
in
conclusion
they
can
not
see
in
that
none
avantage
nor
in
no
other
way
save
marriage
then
saw
they
therein
such
difficulty
by
way
of
reason
for
to
speak
all
plain
because
that
there
was
such
diversity
between
their
bothe
lawes
that
they
sayn
they
that
no
christian
prince
would
wedden
his
child
under
our
lawe
sweet
that
us
was
given
by
our
prophete
and
he
answered
rather
than
i
lose
constance
i
will
be
christen
doubteless
i
must
be
hers
i
may
none
other
choose
i
pray
you
hold
your
arguments
in
peace
save
my
life
and
be
not
reckeless
to
gette
her
that
hath
my
life
in
cure
for
in
this
woe
i
may
not
long
endure
what
needeth
greater
dilatation
i
say
by
treaty
and
ambassadry
and
by
the
pope
mediation
and
all
the
church
and
all
the
chivalry
that
in
destruction
of
and
in
increase
of
christe
lawe
dear
they
be
so
as
ye
may
hear
how
that
the
soudan
and
his
baronage
and
all
his
lieges
shall
be
and
he
shall
have
constance
in
marriage
and
certain
gold
i
what
quantity
not
and
hereto
find
they
suffisant
surety
the
same
accord
is
sworn
on
either
side
now
fair
constance
almighty
god
thee
guide
now
woulde
some
men
waiten
as
i
guess
that
i
should
tellen
all
the
the
which
the
emperor
of
his
noblesse
hath
for
his
daughter
dame
constance
well
may
men
know
that
so
great
ordinance
may
no
man
tellen
in
a
little
clause
as
was
arrayed
for
so
high
a
cause
bishops
be
shapen
with
her
for
to
wend
lordes
ladies
and
knightes
of
renown
and
other
folk
enough
this
is
the
end
and
notified
is
throughout
all
the
town
that
every
wight
with
great
devotioun
should
pray
to
christ
that
he
this
marriage
receive
and
speede
this
voyage
good
will
the
day
is
comen
of
her
departing
i
say
the
woful
fatal
day
is
come
that
there
may
be
no
longer
tarrying
but
forward
they
them
all
and
some
to
set
constance
that
was
with
sorrow
all
full
pale
arose
and
dressed
her
to
wend
for
well
she
saw
there
was
no
other
end
alas
what
wonder
is
it
though
she
wept
that
shall
be
sent
to
a
strange
nation
from
friendes
that
so
tenderly
her
kept
and
to
be
bound
under
subjection
of
one
she
knew
not
his
condition
husbands
be
all
good
and
have
been
that
knowe
wives
i
dare
say
no
more
father
she
said
thy
wretched
child

kept
it
strongly
many
a
winter
space
under

that
was
full
wise
and
worthy
of
his

turn
i
will
again
to
my

satan

saw
of

all
her
perfectioun

made
a

that
dwelt
in

revenge
on

her
so
hot
of
foul
affectioun
that
verily
him
thought
that

he
wooed
her
but
it
availed
nought
she
woulde
do
no
sinne
by
no
way
and
for
despite
he
compassed
his
thought
to
make
her
a
shameful
death
to
dey
he
waiteth
when
the
constable
is
away
and
privily
upon
a
night
he
crept
in
hermegilda
chamber
while

sleepeth
constance
and
hermegild
also
this

through
satanas
temptation
all

and
cut
the
throat
of
hermegild
in

and
laid
the
bloody
knife
by

and
went
his
way
there
god
give
him
mischance
soon
after
came
the

home
again
and
eke
alla
that
king
was

this
false
knight
that

wrought
her
in

done
this
thing

natheless
there
was
great
murmuring
among
the
people
that

had
done
so
great
a
wickedness
for
they
had
seen
her

enough
be
godde
grace
for

weather
almighty

purchase
and
bring

home
i
can
no
better
say
but
in
the

she
drived
forth
her
way
alla
the
king
came
home
soon
after
this
unto
the
castle
of
the
which
i
told
and
asked
where
his
wife
and
his
child
is
the
constable
gan
about
his
heart
feel
cold
and
plainly
all
the
matter
he
him
told
as
ye

no
better
and
shew
the

till
he
muste
beknow
and
tell
it
flat
and
plain
from
night
to
night
in
what
place
he
had
lain
and
thus
by
wit
and
subtle
inquiring
imagin
was
by
whom
this
harm
gan
spring
the
hand
was
known
that
had
the
letter
wrote
and
all
the
venom
of
the
cursed
deed
but
in
what
wise
certainly
i
know
not
th
effect
is
this
that
alla
of
drede
his
mother
slew
that
may
men
plainly
read
for
that
she
traitor
was
to
her
liegeance
thus
ended
olde
donegild
with
mischance
the
sorrow
that
this
alla
night
and
day
made
for
his
wife
and
for
his
child
also
there
is
no
tongue
that
it
telle
may
but
now
will
i
again
to

in
the

in
pain
and
woe
five
year
and
more
as
liked

ere
that
her

on

and
on
her

some
mind
that

to
spill
as
i
shall
tell

there
many
a

shortly
from

on
a
night

sometimes
but
for
th

sailing
full
royally
and
met
the
ship
driving
as
saith
the
story
in
which
constance
sat
full
piteously
and
nothing
knew
he
what
she
was
nor
why
she
was
in
such
array
nor
she
will
say
of
her
estate
although
that
she
should
dey
he
brought
her
unto
rome
and
to
his
wife
he
gave
her
and
her
younge
son
also
and
with
the
senator
she
led
her
life
thus
can
our
lady
bringen
out
of
woe
woeful
constance
and
many
another
mo
and
longe
time
she
dwelled
in
that
place
in
holy
works
ever
as
was
her
grace
the
senatores
wife
her
aunte
was
but
for
all
that
she
knew
her
the
more
i
will
no
longer
tarry
in
this
case
but
to
king
alla
whom
i
spake
of
yore
that
for
his
wife
wept
and
sighed
sore
i
will
return
and
leave
i
will
constance
under
the
senatores
governance
king
alla
which
that
had
his
mother
slain
upon
a
day
fell
in
such
repentance
that
if
i
shortly
tell
it
shall
and
plain
to
rome
he
came
to
receive
his
penitance
and
put
him
in
the
pope
ordinance
in
high
and
low
and
jesus
christ
besought
forgive
his
wicked
works
that
he
had
wrought
the
fame
anon
throughout
the
town
is
borne
how
alla
king
shall
come
on
pilgrimage
by
harbingers
that
wente
him
beforn
for
which
the
senator
as
was
usage
rode
again
and
many
of
his
lineage
meet
as
well
to
show
his
high
magnificence
as
to
do
any
king
a
reverence
great
did
this
noble
senator
to
king
alla
and
he
to
him
also
each
of
them
did
the
other
great
honor
and
so
befell
that
in
a
day
or
two
this
senator
did
to
king
alla
go
to
feast
and
shortly
if
i
shall
not
lie
constance
son
went
in
his
company
some
men
would
say
at
request
of
constance
this
senator
had
led
this
child
to
feast
i
may
not
tellen
every
circumstance
be
as
be
may
there
was
he
at
the
least
but
sooth
is
this
that
at
his
mother
before
alla
during
meates
space
the
child
stood
looking
in
the
kinges
face
this
alla
king
had
of
this
child
great
wonder
and
to
the
senator
he
said
anon
whose
is
that
faire
child
that
standeth
yonder
i
quoth
he
by
god
and
by
saint
john
not
a
mother
he
hath
but
father
hath
he
none
that
i
of
wot
and
shortly
in
a
time
he
told
to
alla
how
this
child
was
found
but
god
wot
quoth
this
senator
also
so
virtuous
a
liver
in
all
my
life
i
never
saw
as
she
nor
heard
of
of
worldly
woman
maiden
widow
or
wife
i
dare
well
say
she
hadde
a
knife
throughout
her
breast
than
be
a
woman
wick
there
is
no
man
could
bring
her
to
that
prick
now
was
this
child
as
like
unto
constance
as
possible
is
a
creature
to
be
this
alla
had
the
face
in
remembrance
of
dame
constance
and
thereon
mused
he
if
that
the
childe
mother
aught
be
that
was
his
wife
and
privily
he
sight
and
sped
him
from
the
table
he
might
fast
as
he
parfay
thought
he
is
in
mine
head
my
faith
i
ought
to
deem
of
skilful
judgement
fantasy
that
in
the
salte
sea
my
wife
is
dead
and
afterward
he
made
his
argument
what
wot
i
if
that
christ
have
hither
sent
my
wife
by
sea
as
well
as
he
her
sent
to
my
country
from
thennes
that
she
went
and
after
noon
home
with
the
senator
went
alla
for
to
see
this
wondrous
chance
this
senator
did
alla
great
honor
and
hastily
he
sent
after
constance
but
truste
well
her
liste
not
to
dance
when
that
she
wiste
wherefore
was
that
sond
upon
her
feet
she
mighte
stand
difficulty
when
alla
saw
his
wife
fair
he
her
gret
and
wept
that
it
was
ruthe
for
to
see
for
at
the
firste
look
he
on
her
set
he
knew
well
verily
that
it
was
she
and
she
for
sorrow
as
dumb
stood
as
a
tree
so
was
her
hearte
shut
in
her
distress
when
she
remember
his
unkindeness
twice
she
swooned
in
his
owen
sight
he
wept
and
him
excused
piteously
now
god
quoth
he
and
all
his
hallows
so
on
my
soule
have
mercy
that
of
your
harm
as
guilteless
am
i
as
is
maurice
my
son
so
like
your
face
else
may
the
fiend
me
fetch
out
of
this
place
long
was
the
sobbing
and
the
bitter
pain
ere
that
their
woeful
heartes
mighte
cease
great
was
the
pity
for
to
hear
them
plain
through
whiche
plaintes
gan
their
woe
increase
i
pray
you
all
my
labour
to
release
i
may
not
tell
all
their
woe
till
i
am
so
weary
for
to
speak
of
sorrow
but
finally
when
that
the
is
wist
is
that
alla
guiltless
was
of
all
her
woe
i
trow
an
hundred
times
have
they
kiss
and
such
a
bliss
is
there
betwixt
them
two
that
save
the
joy
that
lasteth
evermo
there
is
none
like
that
any
creature
hath
seen
or
shall
see
while
the
world
may
dure
then
prayed
she
her
husband
meekely
in
the
relief
of
her
long
piteous
pine
that
he
would
pray
her
father
specially
that
of
his
majesty
he
would
incline
to
vouchesafe
some
day
with
him
to
dine
she
pray
him
eke
that
he
should
by
no
way
unto
her
father
no
word
of
her
say
some
men
would
say
how
that
the
child
maurice
did
this
message
unto
the
emperor
but
as
i
guess
alla
was
not
so
nice
to
him
that
is
so
sovereign
of
honor
as
he
that
is
of
christian
folk
the
send
any
child
but
better
is
to
deem
he
went
himself
and
so
it
may
well
seem
this
emperor
hath
granted
gentilly
to
come
to
dinner
as
he
him
besought
and
well
i
he
looked
busily
know
upon
this
child
and
on
his
daughter
thought
alla
went
to
his
inn
and
as
him
ought
for
this
feast
in
every
wise
farforth
as
his
may
suffice
far
as
his
the
morrow
came
and
alla
gan
him
dress
ready
and
eke
his
wife
the
emperor
to
meet
and
forth
they
rode
in
joy
and
in
gladness
and
when
she
saw
her
father
in
the
street
she
lighted
down
and
fell
before
his
feet
father
quoth
she
your
younge
child
constance
is
now
full
clean
out
of
your
remembrance
i
am
your
daughter
your
constance
quoth
she
that
whilom
ye
have
sent
into
syrie
it
am
i
father
that
in
the
salt
sea
was
put
alone
and
for
to
die
now
goode
father
i
you
mercy
cry
send
me
no
more
into
none
heatheness
but
thank
my
lord
here
of
his
kindeness
who
can
the
piteous
joye
tellen
all
betwixt
them
three
since
they
be
thus
but
of
my
tale
make
an
end
i
shall
the
day
goes
fast
i
will
no
longer
let
these
gladde
folk
to
dinner
be
in
joy
and
bliss
at
meat
i
let
them
dwell
a
thousand
fold
well
more
than
i
can
tell
this
child
maurice
was
since
then
emperor
made
by
the
pope
and
lived
christianly
to
christe
churche
did
he
great
honor
but
i
let
all
his
story
passe
by
of
constance
is
my
tale
especially
in
the
olde
roman
men
may
find
maurice
life
i
bear
it
not
in
mind
this
king
alla
when
he
his
time
sey
with
his
constance
his
holy
wife
so
sweet
to
england
are
they
come
the
righte
way
where
they
did
live
in
joy
and
in
quiet
but
little
while
it
lasted
i
you
hete
joy
of
this
world
for
time
will
not
abide
from
day
to
night
it
changeth
as
the
tide
who
liv
ever
in
such
delight
one
day
that
him
not
moved
either
conscience
or
ire
or
talent
or
kind
affray
kind
of
envy
or
pride
or
passion
or
offence
i
say
but
for
this
ende
this
sentence
that
little
while
in
joy
or
in
pleasance
lasted
the
bliss
of
alla
with
constance
for
death
that
takes
of
high
and
low
his
rent
when
passed
was
a
year
even
as
i
guess
out
of
this
world
this
king
alla
he
hent
for
whom
constance
had
full
great
heaviness
now
let
us
pray
that
god
his
soule
bless
and
dame
constance
finally
to
say
toward
the
town
of
rome
went
her
way
to
rome
is
come
this
holy
creature
and
findeth
there
her
friendes
whole
and
sound
now
is
she
scaped
all
her
aventure
and
when
that
she
her
father
hath
down
on
her
knees
falleth
she
to
ground
weeping
for
tenderness
in
hearte
blithe
she
god
an
hundred
thousand
sithe
in
virtue
and
in
holy
they
liven
all
and
asunder
wend
till
death
departeth
them
this
life
they
lead
and
fare
now
well
my
tale
is
at
an
end
now
jesus
christ
that
of
his
might
may
send
joy
after
woe
govern
us
in
his
grace
and
keep
us
alle

place
notes
to
the
man
of
law
tale
this
tale
is
believed
by
tyrwhitt
to
have
been
taken
with
no
material
change
from
the
confessio
amantis
of
john
gower
who
was
contemporary
with
chaucer
though
somewhat
his
senior
in
the
prologue
the
references
to
the
stories
of
canace
and
of
apollonius
tyrius
seem
to
be
an
attack
on
gower
who
had
given
these
tales
in
his
book
whence
tyrwhitt
concludes
that
the
friendship
between
the
two
poets
suffered
some
interruption
in
the
latter
part
of
their
lives
gower
was
not
the
inventor
of
the
story
which
he
found
in
old
french
romances
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
chaucer
may
have
gone
to
the
same
source
as
gower
though
the
latter
undoubtedly
led
the
way
transcriber

later
commentators
have
identified
the
introduction
describing
the
sorrows
of
poverty
along
with
the
other
moralising
interludes
in

as
translated
from

since
i
twelve

was

age
thanked
be
god
that
etern
on

husbands
at

door
have
i
had
five
for
i
so
often
have
be
and
all
were
worthy
men
in
their
degree
but
me
was
told
not
longe
time
gone
is
that
christe
went
never
but
ones
to
wedding
in
the
of
galilee
that
by
that
example
taught
he
me
that
i
not
wedded
shoulde
be
but
once
lo
hearken
eke
a
sharp
word
for
the
nonce
beside
a
welle
jesus
god
and
man
spake
in
reproof
of
the
samaritan
thou
hast
five
husbandes
said
he
and
man
that
now
hath
wedded
thee
is
not
thine
husband
thus
said
he
certain
what
that
he
meant
thereby
i
can
not
sayn
but
that
i
aske
why
the
fifthe
man
was
not
husband
to
the
samaritan
how
many
might
she
have
in
marriage
yet
heard
i
never
tellen
mine
my
upon
this
number
definitioun
men
may
divine
and
up
and
down
but
well
i
wot
express
without
a
lie
god
bade
us
for
to
wax
and
multiply
that
gentle
text
can
i
well
understand
eke
well
i
wot
he
said
that
mine
husband
should
leave
father
and
mother
and
take
to
me
but
of
no
number
mention
made
he
of
bigamy
or
of
octogamy
why
then
should
men
speak
of
it
villainy
if
it
were
a
disgrace
lo
here
the
wise
king
solomon
i
trow
that
he
had
wives
more
than
one
as
would
to
god
it
lawful
were
to
me
to
be
refreshed
half
so
oft
as
he
what
of
god
had
he
for
all
his
wives
favour
licence
no
man
hath
such
that
in
this
world
alive
is
god
wot
this
noble
king
to
my
wit
i
the
first
night
had
many
a
merry
fit
with
each
of
them
so
was
him
on
live
well
he
blessed
be
god
that
i
have
wedded
five
welcome
the
sixth
whenever
that
he
shall
for
since
i
will
not
keep
me
chaste
in
all
when
mine
husband
is
from
the
world
some
christian
man
shall
wedde
me
anon
for
then
th
apostle
saith
that
i
am
free
to
wed
god
half
where
it
liketh
me
god
he
saith
that
to
be
wedded
is
no
sin
better
is
to
be
wedded
than
to
brin
what
me
though
folk
say
of
lamech
and
his
bigamy
wicked
i
wot
well
abraham
was
a
holy
man
and
jacob
eke
as
far
as
i
can
and
each
of
them
had
wives
more
than
two
and
many
another
holy
man
also
where
can
ye
see
any
manner
age
any
that
highe
god
marriage
by
word
express
i
pray
you
tell
it
me
or
where
commanded
he
virginity
i
wot
as
well
as
you
it
is
no
dread
th
apostle
when
he
spake
of
maidenhead
he
said
that
precept
thereof
had
he
none
men
may
counsel
a
woman
to
be
one
maid
but
counseling
is
no
commandement
he
put
it
in
our
owen
judgement
for
hadde
god
commanded
maidenhead
then
had
he
wedding
out
of
dread
and
certes
if
there
were
no
seed
virginity
then
whereof
should
it
grow
paul
durste
not
commanden
at
the
least
a
thing
of
which
his
master
gave
no
hest
the
is
set
up
for
virginity
catch
whoso
may
who
runneth
best
let
see
but
this
word
is
not
of
every
wight
there
god
will
give
it
of
his
might
i
wot
well
that
th
apostle
was
a
maid
but
natheless
although
he
wrote
and
said
he
would
that
every
wight
were
such
as
he
all
is
but
counsel
to
virginity
and
since
to
be
a
wife
he
gave
me
leave
of
indulgence
so
is
it
no
reproach
to
wedde
me
if
that
my
should
die
husband
without
of
bigamy
reproach
were
good
no
woman
for
to
touch
it
might
he
meant
as
in
his
bed
or
in
his
couch
for
peril
is
both
fire
and
tow
ye
know
what
this
example
may
resemble
this
is
all
and
some
he
held
virginity
more
profit
than
wedding
in
frailty
clepe
i
but
that
he
and
she
i
call
it
would
lead
their
lives
all
in
chastity
i
grant
it
well
i
have
of
none
envy
who
maidenhead
prefer
to
bigamy
it
liketh
them
t
be
clean
in
body
and
ghost
of
mine
i
will
not
make
a
boast
for
well
ye
know
a
lord
in
his
household
hath
not
every
vessel
all
of
gold
some
are
of
tree
and
do
their
lord
service
god
calleth
folk
to
him
in
sundry
wise
and
each
one
hath
of
god
a
proper
gift
some
this
some
that
as
liketh
him
to
shift
distribute
virginity
is
great
perfection
and
continence
eke
with
devotion
but
christ
that
of
perfection
is
the
well
bade
not
every
wight
he
should
go
sell
all
that
he
had
and
give
it
to
the
poor
and
in
such
wise
follow
him
and
his
lore
he
spake
to
them
that
would
live
perfectly
and
lordings
by
your
leave
that
am
not
i
i
will
bestow
the
flower
of
mine
age
in
th
acts
and
in
the
fruits
of
marriage
tell
me
also
to
what
purpose
were
members
made
of
generation
and
of
so
perfect
wise
a
trust
me
right
well
they
were
not
made
for
nought
glose
whoso
will
and
say
both
up
and
down
that
they
were
made
for
the
purgatioun
of
urine
and
of
other
thinges
smale
and
eke
to
know
a
female
from
a
male
and
for
none
other
cause
say
ye
no
experience
wot
well
it
is
not
so
so
that
the
be
not
with
me
wroth
i
say
this
that
they
were
made
for
both
that
is
to
say
office
and
for
duty
and
of
engendrure
there
we
god
not
displease
for
why
should
men
elles
in
their
bookes
set
that
man
shall
yield
unto
his
wife
her
debt
now
wherewith
should
he
make
his
payement
if
he
us
not
his
silly
instrument
then
were
they
made
upon
a
creature
to
purge
urine
and
eke
for
engendrure
but
i
say
not
that
every
wight
is
hold
that
hath
such
as
i
to
you
told
to
go
and
use
them
in
engendrure
then
should
men
take
of
chastity
no
cure
christ
was
a
maid
and
as
a
man
and
many
a
saint
since
that
this
world
began
yet
ever
liv
in
perfect
chastity
i
will
not
with
no
virginity
let
them
with
bread
of
wheat
be
fed
and
let
us
wives
eat
our
barley
bread
and
yet
with
barley
bread
mark
tell
us
can
our
lord
jesus
refreshed
many
a
man
in
such
estate
as
god
hath
us
us
to
i
persevere
i
am
not
precious
in
wifehood
i
will
use
mine
instrument
as
freely
as
my
maker
hath
it
sent
if
i
be
god
give
me
sorrow
of
my
favours
mine
husband
shall
it
have
both
eve
and
morrow
when
that
him
list
come
forth
and
pay
his
debt
a
husband
will
i
have
i
no
let
bear
no
which
shall
be
both
my
debtor
and
my
thrall
and
have
his
tribulation
withal
upon
his
flesh
while
that
i
am
his
wife
i
have
the
power
during
all
my
life
upon
his
proper
body
and
not
he
right
thus
th
apostle
told
it
unto
me
and
bade
our
husbands
for
to
love
us
well
all
this
sentence
me
liketh
every
deal
up
start
the
pardoner
and
that
anon

nay
thou
shalt
drinken
of
another
tun
ere

savour
worse
than

and
when
that
i
have
told
thee
forth
my
tale
of
tribulation
in
marriage
of
which
i
am
expert
in
all
mine
age
this
is
to
say
myself
hath
been
the
whip
then
mayest
thou
choose
whether
thou
wilt
sip
of
tunne
that
i
now
shall
broach
beware
of
it
ere
thou
too
nigh
approach
for
i
shall
tell
examples
more
than
ten
whoso

not
beware
by
other
men
by
him
shall
other
men
corrected
be
these
same
wordes
writeth
ptolemy
read
in
his
almagest
and
take

there
dame
i
would
pray
you
if

it
were
saide
this
pardoner
as
ye
began

your
tale
and
spare
for
no
man
and
teach
us
younge
men
of
your
practique
gladly
quoth
she
since
that
it
may
you
like
but
that
i
pray
to
all
this
company
if
that
i
speak
after
my
fantasy
to
take
nought
what
i
may
say
heart
for
mine
intent
is
only
for
to
play
now
sirs
then
will
i
tell
you
forth
my
tale
as
ever
may
i
drinke
wine
or
ale
i
shall
say
sooth
the
husbands
that
i
had
three
of
them
were
good
and
two
were
bad
the
three
were
goode
men
and
rich
and
old
mighte
they
the
statute
could
with
difficulty
in
which
that
they
were
bounden
unto
me
obey
the
yet
wot
well
what
i
mean
of
this
pardie
god
as
god
me
help
i
laugh
when
that
i
think
how
piteously
at
night
i
made
them
swink
but
my
fay
i
told
of
it
no
store
my
faith
i
held
it
they
had
me
their
land
and
their
treasor
of
no
me
needed
not
do
longer
diligence
to
win
their
love
or
do
them
reverence
they
loved
me
so
well
by
god
above
that
i
no
of
their
love
nothing
a
wise
woman
will
busy
her
to
get
their
love
where
that
she
hath
none
but
since
i
had
them
wholly
in
my
hand
and
that
they
had
me
given
all
their
land
why
should
i
take
them
for
to
please
it
were
for
my
profit
or
mine
ease
i
set
them
so
by
my
fay
that
many
a
night
they
sange
the
bacon
was
not
fetched
for
them
i
trow
that
some
men
have
in
essex
at
i
govern
them
so
well
after
my
law
that
each
of
them
full
blissful
was
and
to
bringe
me
gay
thinges
from
the
fair
they
were
full
glad
when
that
i
spake
them
fair
for
god
it
wot
i
them
spiteously
them
now
hearken
how
i
bare
me
properly
ye
wise
wives
that
can
understand
thus
should
ye
speak
and
them
wrong
on
hand
them
for
half
so
boldely
can
there
no
man
believe
swearen
and
lien
as
a
woman
can
i
say
not
this
by
wives
that
be
wise
it
be
when
they
them
misadvise
unadvisedly
a
wise
wife
if
that
she
her
good
shall
them
on
the
cow
is
wood
them
and
take
witness
of
her
owen
maid
of
their
assent
but
hearken
how
i
said
sir
olde
kaynard
is
this
thine
array
why
is
my
neigheboure
wife
so
gay
she
is
honour
all
she
i
sit
at
home
i
have
no
cloth
what
dost
thou
at
my
neigheboure
house
is
she
so
fair
art
thou
so
amorous
what
thou
with
our
maid
benedicite
sir
olde
lechour
let
thy
be
and
if
i
have
a
gossip
or
a
friend
withoute
guilt
thou
chidest
as
a
fiend
if
that
i
walk
or
play
unto
his
house
thou
comest
home
as
drunken
as
a
mouse
and
preachest
on
thy
bench
with
evil
prefe
thou
to
me
it
is
a
great
mischief
to
wed
a
poore
woman
for
costage
and
if
that
she
be
rich
of
high
parage
birth
then
thou
that
it
is
a
tormentry
to
suffer
her
pride
and
melancholy
and
if
that
she
be
fair
thou
very
knave
thou
that
every
will
her
have
she
may
no
while
in
chastity
abide
that
is
assailed
upon
every
side
thou
some
folk
desire
us
for
richess
some
for
our
shape
and
some
for
our
fairness
and
some
for
she
can
either
sing
or
dance
and
some
for
gentiless
and
dalliance
some
for
her
handes
and
her
armes
smale
thus
goes
all
to
the
devil
by
thy
tale
thou
men
may
not
keep
a
castle
wall
that
may
be
so
assailed
all
and
if
that
she
be
foul
thou
that
she
coveteth
every
man
that
she
may
see
for
as
a
spaniel
she
will
on
him
leap
till
she
may
finde
some
man
her
to
cheap
and
none
so
grey
goose
goes
there
in
the
lake
so
thou
that
will
be
without
a
make
and
it
is
a
hard
thing
for
to
weld
govern
a
thing
that
no
man
will
thankes
held
with
his
thus
thou
lorel
when
thou
to
bed
and
that
no
wise
man
needeth
for
to
wed
nor
no
man
that
intendeth
unto
heaven
with
wilde
thunder
and
fiery
stroke
thy
wicked
necke
be
thou
that
dropping
houses
and
eke
smoke
and
chiding
wives
make
men
to
flee
out
of
their
owne
house
ah
what
aileth
such
an
old
man
for
to
chide
thou
we
wives
will
our
vices
hide
till
we
be
fast
and
then
we
will
them
shew
well
may
that
be
a
proverb
of
a
shrew
wretch
thou
that
oxen
asses
horses
hounds
they
be
at
diverse
stounds
at
various
basons
and
lavers
ere
that
men
them
buy
seasons
spoones
stooles
and
all
such
husbandry
and
so
be
pots
and
clothes
and
array
but
folk
of
wives
make
none
assay
till
they
be
wedded
olde
dotard
shrew
and
then
thou
we
will
our
vices
shew
thou
also
that
it
displeaseth
me
but
if
that
thou
wilt
praise
my
beauty
and
thou
pore
alway
upon
my
face
and
call
me
faire
dame
in
every
place
and
thou
make
a
feast
on
day
that
i
was
born
and
make
me
fresh
and
gay
and
but
thou
do
to
my
honour
and
to
my
within
my
and
to
my
father
folk
and
mine
allies
thus
sayest
thou
old
barrel
full
of
lies
and
yet
also
of
our
prentice
jenkin
for
his
crisp
hair
shining
as
gold
so
fine
and
for
he
squireth
me
both
up
and
down
yet
hast
thou
caught
a
false
suspicioun
i
will
him
not
though
thou
wert
dead
but
tell
me
this
why
hidest
thou
sorrow
on
thee
the
keyes
of
thy
chest
away
from
me
it
is
my
as
well
as
thine
pardie
what
to
make
an
idiot
of
our
dame
now
by
that
lord
that

of
my
body
and
my
good
the
one
thou
shalt
forego
thine
eyen
spite
of
what
helpeth
it
of
me
and
spyen

trow
thou
wouldest
lock
me
in
thy
chest

shouldest
say

lest
take
your
disport
i
will

we
will
be
at
our
large
of
alle

most
blessed
may
he
be
the
wise
astrologer
ptolemy
that

this
proverb
in
his
almagest
alle

how
merrily
that
other
folkes
fare
for

enough
thee
not
thee
thou
also
if
that
we
make

and
with
precious
array
that
it
is
peril
of
our
chastity
and
yet
with
sorrow

and
these
words
in
the
apostle

desire
to
consume
every

so
a

destroyeth
her
husbond
this
know
they
well
that
be
to

bond
lordings
right
thus
as
ye
have
understand
i
stiffly
mine
old
husbands
on
hand
them
that
thus
they
saiden
in
their
drunkenness
and
all
was
false
but
that
i
took
witness
on
jenkin
and
upon
my
niece
also
o
lord
the
pain
i
did
them
and
the
woe
guilteless
by
godde
sweete
pine
for
as
a
horse
i
coulde
bite
and
whine
i
coulde
plain
i
was
in

guilt
though
or
elles
oftentime
i
had
been
whoso
first
cometh
to
the
nilll
first
grint
ground
i
plained
first
so
was
our
war
they
were
full
glad
to
excuse
them
full
of
things
that
they
never
their
live
guilty
in
their
of
wenches
would
i
them
on

accuse
when
that
for
sickness
scarcely
might
they
stand
yet
tickled
i
his
hearte
for
that
he
that
i
had
of
him
so

i
swore
that
all
my
walking

that
he
dight
under

while
that
they

thus
of

i
may
vaunte
me
at
th
end
i
had
the
better
in
each
degree
by
sleight
or
force
or
by
some
manner
thing
as
by
continual

or
grudging
there
hadde
they
mischance
there
would
i
chide
and
do
them
no

i
would
no

in

bed
abide
if
that
i
felt
his
arm
over
my
side
till
he
had
made
his
ransom
unto

then
would
i
suffer
him
do
his

of
my
fourth
husband
my
fourthe
husband
was
a
revellour
this
is
to
say
he
had
a
paramour
and
i
was
young
and
full
of
ragerie
stubborn
and
strong
and
jolly
as
a
pie
then
could
i
dance
to
a
harpe
smale
and
sing
as
any
nightingale
when
i
had
drunk
a
draught
of
sweete
wine
metellius
the
foule
churl
the
swine
that
with
a
staff
bereft
his
wife
of
life
for
she
drank
wine
though
i
had
been
his
wife
never
should
he
have
daunted
me
from
drink
and
after
wine
of
venus
most
i
think
for
all
so
sure
as
cold
engenders
hail
a
liquorish
mouth
must
have
a
liquorish
tail
in
woman
is
no
defence
of
wine
this
knowe
lechours
by
experience
but
lord
christ
when
that
it
me
upon
my
youth
and
on
my
jollity
it
tickleth
me
about
mine
unto
this
day
it
doth
mine
hearte
boot
that
i
have
had
my
world
as
in
my
time
but
age
alas
that
all
will
envenime
embitter
hath
me
bereft
my
beauty
and
my
pith
let
go
farewell
the
devil
go
therewith
the
flour
is
gon
there
is
no
more
to
tell
the
bran
as
i
best
may
now
must
i
sell
but
yet
to
be
right
merry
will
i
fand
now
forth
to
tell
you
of
my
fourth
husband
i
say
i
in
my
heart
had
great
despite
that
he
of
any
other
had
delight
but
he
was
quit
by
god
and
by
saint
joce
paid
back
i
made
for
him
of
the
same
wood
a
cross
not
of
my
body
in
no
foul
mannere
but
certainly
i
made
folk
such
cheer
that
in
his
owen
grease
i
made
him
fry
for
anger
and
for
very
jealousy
by
god
in
earth
i
was
his
purgatory
for
which
i
hope
his
soul
may
be
in
glory
for
god
it
wot
he
sat
full
oft
and
sung
when
that
his
shoe
full
bitterly
him
wrung
there
was
no
wight
save
god
and
he
that
wist
in
many
wise
how
sore
i
did
him
he
died
when
i
came
from
jerusalem
and
lies
in
grave
under
the
beam
although
his
tomb
is
not
so
curious
as
was
the
sepulchre
of
darius
which
that
apelles
wrought
so
subtlely
it
is
but
waste
to
bury
them
preciously
let
him
fare
well
god
give
his
soule
rest
he
is
now
in
his
grave
and
in
his
chest
now
of
my
fifthe
husband
will
i
tell
god
let
his
soul
never
come
into
hell
and
yet
was
he
to
me
the
moste
shrew
that
feel
i
on
my
ribbes
all
rew
a
row
and
ever
shall
until
mine
ending
day
but
in
our
bed
he
was
so
fresh
and
gay
and
therewithal
so
well
he
could
me
glose
when
that
he
woulde
have
my
belle
chose
though
he
had
beaten
me
on
every
bone
yet
could
he
win
again
my
love
anon
i
trow
i
lov
him
better
for
that
he
was
of
his
love
so
to
me
difficult
we
women
have
if
that
i
shall
not
lie
in
this
matter
a
quainte
fantasy
whatever
thing
we
may
not
lightly
have
thereafter
will
we
cry
all
day
and
crave
forbid

that
desire

he
if

shoulde
wedde
me
for
certainly
i
say
for
no
bobance
yet
was

never
without
of

nor
of
other
thinges
eke
i
hold
a
mouse
wit

but
one
hole
for

and
if

then

that
subtilty
and

have
slain

as
i
lay
upright
and
all

full
of
very
blood
but
yet
i
hop
that
he
should
do
me
good
for
blood
betoken
gold
as
me

all
was
false
i
dream
of
him

but
as
i
follow
aye
my
dame
lore
as
well
of
that
as
of
other
things
more
but
now
sir
let
me
see
what
shall
i
sayn
aha
by
god
i
have
my
tale
again
when
that
my
fourthe
husband
was
on
bier
i
wept
and
made
a
sorry
cheer
as
wives
must
for
it
is
the
usage
and
with
my
kerchief
covered
my
visage
but
for
i
was
provided
with
a
make
i
wept
but
little
that
i
to
churche
was
mine
husband
borne
with
neighebours
that
for
him
made
sorrow
and
jenkin
oure
clerk
was
one
of
tho
as
help
me
god
when
that
i
saw
him
go
after
the
bier
methought
he
had
a
pair
of
legges
and
of
feet
so
clean
and
fair
that
all
my
heart
i
gave
unto
his
hold
he
was
i
trow
a
twenty
winter
old
and
i
was
forty
if
i
shall
say
sooth
but
yet
i
had
always
a
colte
tooth
i
was
and
that
became
me
well
note
i
had
the
print
of
sainte
venus
seal
as
help
me
god
i
was
a
lusty
one
and
fair
and
rich
and
young
and
begone
a
good
for
certes
i
am
all
the
influence
of
venus
in
feeling
and
my
heart
is
martian
the
influence
of
mars
venus
me
gave
my
lust
and
liquorishness
and
mars
gave
me
my
sturdy
hardiness
mine
ascendant
was
taure
and
mars
therein
alas
alas
that
ever
love
was
sin
i
follow
aye
mine
inclination
by
virtue
of
my
constellation
that
made
me
that
i
coulde
not
withdraw
my
chamber
of
venus
from
a
good
fellaw
yet
have
i
marte
mark
upon
my
face
and
also
in
another
privy
place
for
god
so
be
my
salvation
i
loved
never
by
discretion
but
ever
follow
mine
own
appetite
were
he
short
or
long
or
black
or
white
i
took
no
keep
so
that
he
liked
me
how
poor
he
was
neither
of
what
degree
what
should
i
say
but
that
at
the
month
end
this
jolly
clerk
jenkin
that
was
so
hend
had
wedded
me
with
great
solemnity
and
to
him
gave
i
all
the
land
and
fee
that
ever
was
me
given
therebefore
but
afterward
repented
me
full
sore
he
woulde
suffer
nothing
of
my
list
by
god
he
smote
me
ones
with
his
fist
for
that
i
rent
out
of
his
book
a
leaf
that
of
the
stroke
mine
eare
wax
all
deaf
stubborn
i
was
as
is
a
lioness
and
of
my
tongue
a
very
jangleress
and
walk
i
would
as
i
had
done
beforn
from
house
to
house
although
he
had
it
sworn
sworn
to
for
which
he
oftentimes
woulde
preach
prevent
it
and
me
of
olde
roman
teach
how
that
sulpitius
gallus
left
his
wife
and
her
forsook
for
term
of
all
his
for
nought
but
he
her
looking
out
at
his
door
upon
a
day
another
roman
told
he
me
by
name
that
for
his
wife
was
at
a
summer
game
without
his
knowing
he
forsook
her
eke
and
then
would
he
upon
his
bible
seek
that
proverb
of
ecclesiast
where
he
commandeth
and
forbiddeth
fast
man
shall
not
suffer
his
wife
go
roll
about
then
would
he
say
right
thus
withoute
doubt
whoso
that
buildeth
his
house
all
of
sallows
and
pricketh
his
blind
horse
over
the
fallows
and
his
wife
to
seeke
hallows
is
worthy
to
be
hanged
on
the
gallows
but
all
for
nought
i
not
a
nothing
of
his
proverbs
nor
of
his
olde
saw
nor
would
i
not
of
him
corrected
be
i
hate
them
that
my
vices
telle
me
and
so
do
more
of
us
god
wot
than
i
this
made
him
with
me
all
utterly
i
woulde
not
him
in
no
case
now
will
i
say
you
sooth
by
saint
thomas
why
that
i
rent
out
of
his
book
a
leaf
for
which
he
smote
me
so
that
i
was
deaf
he
had
a
book
that
gladly
night
and
day
for
his
disport
he
would
it
read
alway
he
call
it
valerie
and
theophrast
and
with
that
book
he
laugh
alway
full
fast
and
eke
there
was
a
clerk
sometime
at
rome
a
cardinal
that
highte
saint
jerome
that
made
a
book
against
jovinian
which
book
was
there
and
eke
tertullian
chrysippus
trotula
and
heloise
that
was
an
abbess
not
far
from
paris
and
eke
the
of
solomon
ovide
art
and
many
one
and
alle
these
were
bound
in
one
volume
and
every
night
and
day
was
his
custume
when
he
had
leisure
and
vacation
from
other
worldly
occupation
to
readen
in
this
book
of
wicked
wives
he
knew
of
them
more
legends
and
more
lives
than
be
of
goodde
wives
in
the
bible
for
trust
me
well
it
is
an
impossible
that
any
clerk
will
speake
good
of
wives
it
be
of
holy
saintes
lives
nor
of
none
other
woman
never
the
mo
who
painted
the
lion
tell
it
me
who
by
god
if
women
haddde
written
stories
as
clerkes
have
within
their
oratories
they
would
have
writ
of
men
more
wickedness
than
all
the
mark
of
adam
may
redress
the
children
of
mercury
and
of
venus
be
in
their
working
full
contrarious
mercury
loveth
wisdom
and
science
and
venus
loveth
riot
and
dispence
and
for
their
diverse
disposition
each
falls
in
other
exaltation
as
thus
god
wot
mercury
is
desolate
in
pisces
where
venus
is
exaltate
and
venus
falls
where
mercury
is
raised
therefore
no
woman
by
no
clerk
is
praised
the
clerk
when
he
is
old
and
may
not
do
of
venus
works
not
worth
his
olde
shoe
then
sits
he
down
and
writes
in
his
dotage
that
women
can
not
keep
their
marriage
but
now
to
purpose
why
i
tolde
thee
that
i
was
beaten
for
a
book
pardie
upon
a
night
jenkin
that
was
our
sire
read
on
his
book
as
he
sat
by
the
fire
of
eva
first
that
for
her
wickedness
was
all
mankind
brought
into
wretchedness
for
which
that
jesus
christ
himself
was
slain
that
bought
us
with
his
again
lo
here
express
of
women
may
ye
find
that
woman
was
the
loss
of
all
mankind
then
read
he
me
how
samson
lost
his
hairs
sleeping
his
leman
cut
them
with
her
shears
through
whiche
treason
lost
he
both
his
eyen
then
read
he
me
if
that
i
shall
not
lien
of
hercules
and
of
his
dejanire
that
caused
him
to
set
himself
on
fire
nothing
forgot
he
of
the
care
and
woe
that
socrates
had
with
his
wives
two
how
xantippe
cast
piss
upon
his
head
this
silly
man
sat
still
as
he
were
dead
he
wip
his
head
and
no
more
durst
he
sayn
but
ere
the
thunder
there
cometh
rain
of
phasiphae
that
was
queen
of
crete
for
he
thought
the
tale
sweet
fy
speak
no
more
it
is
a
grisly
thing
of
her
horrible
lust
and
her
liking
of
clytemnestra
for
her
lechery
that
falsely
made
her
husband
for
to
die
he
read
it
with
full
good
devotion
he
told
me
eke
for
what
occasion
amphiorax
at
thebes
lost
his
life
my
husband
had
a
legend
of
his
wife
eryphile
that
for
an
of

privily
unto
the
greekes
told
where
that
her
husband
hid
him
in
a
place
for
which
he
had

thebes
sorry

he
me
and
of
lucie
they
bothe
made
their
husbands
for
to
die
that
one
for
love
that
other
was
for
hate
luna
her
husband
on
an
late
empoison
had
for
that
she
was
his
foe
lucia
liquorish
lov
her
husband
so
that
for
he
should
always
upon
her
think
she
gave
him
such
a
of
that
he
was
dead
before
it
were
the
morrow
and
thus
husbands
hadde
sorrow
then
told
he
me
how
one
latumeus
complained
to
his
fellow
arius
that
in
his
garden
growed

a
tree
on
which
he

that
some

slain
their
husbands

and

while
that
the

all

sir
quoth

right
as

lest
if
i
have
licence
of
this
worthy
frere
yes
dame
quoth
he
tell
forth
and
i
will
hear
notes
to
the
prologue
to
the
wife
of
bath
tale
among
the
evidences
that
chaucer
great
work
was
left
incomplete
is
the
absence
of
any
link
of
connexion
between
the
wife
of
bath
prologue
and
tale
and
what
goes
before
this
deficiency
has
in
some
editions
caused
the
squire
and
the
merchant
tales
to
be
interposed
between
those
of
the
man
of
law
and
the
wife
of
bath
but
in
the
merchant
tale
there
is
internal
proof
that
it
was
told
after
the
jolly
dame
several
manuscripts
contain
verses
designed
to
serve
as
a
connexion
but
they
are
evidently
not
chaucer
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
give
them
here
of
this
prologue
which
may
fairly
be
regarded
as
a
distinct
autobiographical
tale
tyrwhitt
says
the
extraordinary
length
of
it
as
well
as
the
vein
of
pleasantry
that
runs
through
it
is
very
suitable
to
the
character
of
the
speaker
the
greatest
part
must
have
been
of
chaucer
own
invention
though
one
may
plainly
see
that
he
had
been
reading
the
popular
invectives
against
marriage
and
women
in
general
such
as
the
de
la
rose
ad
rufinum
de
non
ducenda
uxore
to
rufinus
on
not
being
ruled
by
one
wife
and
particularly
contra
jovinianum
against
jovinianus
st
jerome
among
other
things
designed
to
discourage
marriage

inserted
in
his
treatise
a
long
passage
from
aureolus

that
the
queen

so
long
they
prayed
the
king
of
his
grace
till
he
his

him
granted
in

gave
him
to

would
him

thanked
the

with

after
this
thus
spake
she
to
the
knight
when
that
she
saw
her
time
upon
a
day
thou

in

but
what
he
might
not

all
as
him
liked
and
at
the
last
he
chose
him
for
to
wend
and
come
again
right
at
the
yeare
end
with
such
answer
as
god
would
him
purvey
and
took
his
leave

wended
forth
his
way
he
sought
in
house
and
place
where
as
he
hoped
for
to
finde
grace
to
learne
what
thing
women
love
the
most
but
he
could
not
arrive
in
any
coast
where
as
he
mighte
find
in
this
mattere
two
creatures
in
fere
some
said
that
women
loved
best
richess
some
said
honour
and
some
said
jolliness
some
rich
array
and
some
said
and
oft
time
to
be
widow
and
be
wed
some
said
that
we
are
in
our
heart
most
eased
when
that
we
are
and
he
full
nigh
the
sooth
i
will
not

win
us
best
with
flattery
the
and
with
attendance
and
with
business

we
bothe
more

less
with
and
some
men
said
that
we
do
love
the
best
for
to
be
free
and
do
as
us
lest
we
and
that
no
man
reprove
us
of
our
vice
but
say
that
we
are
wise
and
nothing
nice
for
truly
there
is
none
among
us
all
if
any
wight
will
us
on
the
gall
note
that
will
not
kick
for
that
he
saith
us

and
he
shall
find
it
that
so
for
be
we
never
so
vicious
within
we
will
be
held
both
wise
and
clean
of
sin
and
some
men
said
that
great
delight
have
we
for
to
be
held
stable
and
eke
secre
and
in
one
purpose
steadfastly
to
dwell
and
not
a

subtlely
from

that
is
to
say
what
women
love
the
most

full
sorrowful
was
his
ghost
but
home
he
went
for
he
might
not
sojourn

day
was
come
that
homeward
he
must
turn
and
in
his
way

to
ride
in
all
his

under
a
forest
side
anxiety
where
as
he
saw
upon
a
dance
go
of
ladies
and
yet
mo
toward
this
dance
he
drew
full
yern
the
hope
that
he
some
wisdom
there
should
learn
but
certainly
ere
he
came
fully
there
was
this
dance
he
knew
not
where
no
creature
saw
he
that
bare
life
save
on
the
green
he
sitting
saw
a
wife
a
fouler

quoth
she
i
could

this
if
that
me
list
ere
it
were
dayes
three
well
ye
mighte
bear
you
unto
me
you
could
conduct
but
for
ye
speaken
of
such
gentleness
yourself
well
as
is
descended
out
of
old
richess
towards
that
therefore
shalle
ye
be
gentlemen
such
arrogancy
is
worth
a
hen
nothing
look
who
that
is
most
virtuous
alway
and
apert
and
most
intendeth
aye
private
and
to
do
the
gentle
deedes
that
he
can
and
take
him
for
the
greatest
gentleman
christ
will
we
claim
of
him
our
gentleness
requires
not
of
our
for
their
old
richess
for
though
they
gave
us
all
their
heritage
for
which
we
claim
to
be
of
high
parage
descent
yet
may
they
not
bequeathe
for
no
thing
to
none
of
us
their
virtuous
living
that
made
them
gentlemen
called
to
be
and
bade
us
follow
them
in
such
degree
well
can
the
wise
poet
of
florence
that
highte
dante
speak
of
this
sentence
lo
in
such
rhyme
is
dante
tale
of
upriseth
by
his
branches
smale
prowess
of
man
for
god
of
his
goodness
wills
that
we
claim
of
him
our
gentleness
for
of
our
elders
may
we
nothing
claim
but
things
that
man
may
hurt
and
maim
eke
every
wight
knows
this
as
well
as
i
if
gentleness
were
planted
naturally
unto
a
certain
lineage
down
the
line
prive
and
apert
then
would
they
never
to
do
of
gentleness
the
fair
office
then
might
they
do
no
villainy
nor
vice
take
fire
and
bear
it
to
the
darkest
house
betwixt
this
and
the
mount
of
caucasus
and
let
men
shut
the
doores
and
go
thenne
yet
will
the
fire
as
fair
and
lighte
as
twenty
thousand
men
might
it
behold
office
natural
aye
will
it
hold
will
perform
its
on
peril
of
my
life
till
that
it
die
natural
here
may
ye
see
well
how
that
nobility
is
not
annexed
to
possession
since
folk
do
not
their
operation
alway
as
doth
the
fire
lo
its
its
very
for
god
it
wot
men
may
full
often
find
a
lorde
son
do
shame
and
villainy
and
he
that
will
have
of
his
honour
he
was
boren
of
a
gentle
house
and
had
his
elders
noble
and
virtuous
and
will
himselfe
do
no
gentle
deedes
nor
follow
his
gentle
ancestry
that
dead
is
he
is
not
gentle
be
he
duke
or
earl
for
villain
sinful
deedes
make
a
churl
for
gentleness
is
but
the
of
thine
ancestors
for
their
high
bounte
worth
which
is
a
strange
thing
to
thy
person
thy
gentleness
cometh
from
god
alone
then
comes
our
gentleness
of
grace
it
was
no
thing
bequeath
us
with
our
place
think
how
noble
as
saith
valerius
was
tullius
hostilius
that
out
of
povert
rose
to
high
read
in
senec
and
read
eke
in
boece
there
shall
ye
see
express
that
it
no
is
that
he
is
gentle
that
doth
gentle
deedes
and
therefore
husband
i
conclude
albeit
that
mine
ancestors
were
rude
yet
may
the
highe
god
and
so
hope
i
grant
me
his
grace
to
live
virtuously
then
am
i
gentle
when
that
i
begin
to
live
virtuously
and
sin
and
whereas
ye
of
povert
me
repreve
the
highe
god
on
whom
that
we
believe
in
wilful
povert
chose
to
lead
his
life
and
certes
every
man
maiden
or
wife
may
understand
that
jesus
heaven
king
ne
would
not
choose
a
virtuous
living
is
an
honest
thing
certain
cheerfully
this
will
senec
and
other
clerkes
sayn
whoso
that
him
paid
his
povert
satisfied
i
hold
him
rich
though
he
hath
not
a
shirt
he
that
coveteth
is
a
poore
wight
for
he
would
have
what
is
not
in
his
might
but
he
that
nought
hath
nor
coveteth
to
have
is
rich
although
ye
hold
him
but
a
knave
abject
wretch
povert
is
sinne
properly
only
true
poverty
is
juvenal
saith
of
povert
merrily
the
poore
man
when
he
goes
by
the
way
before
the
thieves
he
may
sing
and
play
povert
is
hateful
good
and
as
i
guess
a
full
great
out
of
business
from
a
great
amender
eke
of
sapience
to
him
that
taketh
it
in
patience
povert
is
this
although
it
seem
possession
that
no
wight
will
challenge
povert
full
often
when
a
man
is
low
makes
him
his
god
and
eke
himself
to
know
povert
a
is
as
thinketh
me
pair
of
spectacles
through
which
he
may
his
friendes
see
and
therefore
sir
since
that
i
you
not
grieve
of
my
povert
no
more
me
repreve
now
sir
of
ye
repreve
me
and
certes
sir
though
none
dictum
were
in
no
book
ye
gentles
of
honour
say
that
men
should
an
olde
wight
honour
and
call
him
father
for
your
gentleness
and
authors
shall
i
finden
as
i
guess
now
there
ye
say
that
i
am
foul
and
old
then
dread
ye
not
to
be
a
cokewold
for
filth
and
elde
all
so
may
i
the
be
greate
wardens
upon
chastity
but
natheless
since
i
know
your
delight
i
shall
fulfil
your
wordly
appetite
choose
now
quoth

of
these
thinges
tway
to
have

your

mine

master
dear
notes
to
the
prologue
to
the
friar
tale
on
the
tale
of
the
friar
and
that
of
the
sompnour
which
follows
tyrwhitt
has
remarked
that
they
are
well
engrafted
upon
that
of
the
wife
of
bath
the
which
shows
itself
between
these
two
characters
is
quite
natural
as
no
two
professions
at
that
time
were
at
more
constant
variance
the
regular
clergy
and
particularly
the
mendicant
friars
affected
a
total
exemption
from
all
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
except
that
of
the
pope
which
made
them
exceedingly
obnoxious
to
the
bishops
and
of
course
to
all
the
inferior
officers
of
the
national
hierarchy
both
tales
whatever
their
origin
are
bitter
satires
on
the
greed
and
worldliness
of
the
romish
clergy
the
tale
there
was
dwelling
in
my
country
on
a
time
an
archdeacon
a
man
of
high
degree
that
boldely
did
execution
in
punishing
of
fornication
of
witchecraft
and
eke
of
bawdery
of
defamation
and
adultery
of
and
of
testaments
of
contracts
and
of
lack
of
sacraments
and
eke
of
many
another
crime
of
which
needeth
not
rehearsen
at
this
time
of
usury
and
simony
also
but
certes
lechours
did
he
greatest
woe
they
shoulde
singen
if
that
they
were
hent
and
smale
tithers
were
foul
put
to
shame
if
any
person
would
on
them
complain
there
might
astert
them
no
pecunial
for
smalle
tithes
and
small
offering
he
made
the
people
piteously
to
sing
for
ere
the
bishop
caught
them
with
his
crook
they
weren
in
the
archedeacon
book
then
had
he
through
his
jurisdiction
power
to
do
on
them
correction
he
had
a
sompnour
ready
to
his
hand
a
slier
boy
was
none
in
engleland
for
subtlely
he
had
his
espiaille
that
taught
him
well
where
it
might
aught
avail
he
coulde
spare
of
lechours
one
or
two
to

a
cause
of
his

albeit
that
it

me
right
well
our
orisons
be
more
effectuel
and
more
we
see
of

secret
things
than
folk
although
that
they
be
kings
we
live
in
povert
and
in
abstinence
and
borel
folk
in
riches
and
dispence
of
meat
and
drink
and
in
their
foul
delight
we
have
this
worlde
all
in
pleasure
lazar

dives
lived
diversely

diverse
hadde
they
thereby
whoso
will
pray
he
must
fast
and
be
clean
and
fat
his
soul
and
keep
his
body
lean
we
fare
as
saith
th
apostle
and
food
suffice
us
although
they
be
not
full
good
the
cleanness
and
the
fasting
of
us
freres
maketh
that
christ
accepteth
our
prayeres
lo
moses
forty
days
and
forty
night
fasted
ere
that
the
high
god
full
of
might
spake
with
him
in
the
mountain
of

with
empty
of

many
a

received
he
the

ere

had
any

and
eke
the
other
priestes
every
one
into
the
temple
when
they
shoulde
gon
to
praye
for
the
people
and
do
service
they
woulde
drinken
in
no
manner
wise
no
drinke
which
that
might
them
drunken
make
but
there
in
abstinence
pray
and
wake
lest
that
they
died
take
heed
what
i
say
they
be
sober

sufficeth
our
lord

humbless
and

to
persecution
for

therefore
may
ye
see
that
our

speak
of
us
we

from
the
serpent
that
so
slily
creeps
under
the
grass
and
stingeth
subtilly
beware
my

and
hearken
patiently
that
twenty
thousand
men
have
lost
their
lives
for
striving
with
their
and
their
wives
now
since
ye
have
so
holy
and
meek
a
wife
what
needeth
you
thomas
to
make
strife
there
is
no
serpent
so
cruel
when
men
tread
on
his
tail
nor
half
so
fell
as
woman
is
when
she
hath
caught
an
ire
vengeance
is
then
all
her
desire
only
ire
is
a
sin
one
of
the
greate
seven
abominable
to
the
god
of
heaven
and
to
himself
it
is
destruction
this
every
vicar
and
parson
can
say
how
ire
engenders
homicide
ire
is
in
sooth
th
of
pride
i
could
of
ire
you
say
so
muche
sorrow
my
tale
shoulde
last
until
and
therefore
pray
i
god
both
day
and
ight
an
man
god
send
him
little
might
it
is
great
harm
and
certes
great
pity
to
set
an
irous
man
in
high
degree
there
was
an
irous
potestate
as
saith
senec
that
during
his
of
office
upon
a
day
out
rode
knightes
two
and
as
fortune
would
that
it
were
so
the
one
of
them
came
home
the
other
not
anon
the
knight
before
the
judge
is
brought
that
saide
thus
hast
thy
fellow
slain
for
which
i
doom
thee
to
the
death
certain
and
to
another
knight
commanded
he
lead
him
to
the
death
i
charge
thee
and
happened
as
they
went
by
the
way
toward
the
place
where
as
he
should
dey
the
knight
came
which
men
had
been
dead
then
thoughte
they
it
was
the
beste
to
lead
them
both
unto
the
judge
again
they
saide
the
knight
hath
not
his
fellow
here
he
standeth
whole
alive
shall
be
dead
quoth
he
may
i
thrive
that
is
to
say
both
one
and
two
and
three
and
to
the
firste
knight
right
thus
spake
he
damned
thee
thou
must
be
dead
all
events
and
thou
also
must
needes
lose
thine
head
for
thou
the
cause
art
why
thy
fellow
dieth
and
to
the
thirde
knight
right
thus
he
sayeth
hast
not
done
that
i
commanded
thee
and
thus
he
did
do
slay
them
alle
three
irous
cambyses
was
eke
dronkelew
drunkard
and
aye
delighted
him
to
be
a
shrew
and
so
befell
a
lord
of
his
meinie
that
loved
virtuous
morality
said
on
a
day
betwixt
them
two
right
thus
lord
is
lost
if
he
be
vicious
an
irous
man
is
like
a
frantic
beast
in
which
there
is
of
wisdom
and
drunkenness
is
eke
a
foul
record
of
any
man
and
of
a
lord
there
is
full
many
an
eye
and
many
an
ear
a
lord
he
knows
not
where
for
godde
love
drink
more
attemperly
wine
maketh
man
to
lose
wretchedly
his
mind
and
eke
his
limbes
every
one
reverse
shalt
thou
see
quoth
he
and
prove
it
by
thine
own
experience
that
wine
doth
to
folk
no
such
offence
there
is
no
wine
bereaveth
me
my
might
of
hand
nor
foot
nor
of
mine
eyen
sight
and
for
despite
he
dranke
muche
more
a
hundred
than
he
had
done
before
and
right
anon
this
cursed
irous
wretch
this
knighte
sone
before
him
fetch
commanding
him
he
should
before
him
stand
and
suddenly
he
took
his
bow
in
hand
and
up
the
string
he
pulled
to
his
ear
and
with
an
arrow
slew
the
child
right
there
whether
have
i
a
hand
or
non
quoth
he
all
my
might
and
mind
agone
hath
wine
bereaved
me
mine
eyen
sight
why
should
i
tell
the
answer
of
the
knight
his
son
was
slain
there
is
no
more
to
say
beware
therefore
with
lordes
how
ye
play
freedom
sing
placebo
and
i
shall
if
i
can
it
be
unto
a
poore
man
to
a
poor
man
men
should
his
vices
tell
but
not
t

he
made
that
the
river
was
so
small
that
women
mighte
wade
it
all
lo
what

that
so
well
teache
can

this

in

upon

when

that

passing
any

set
in
gold
and
in
azure
brooches
and

and
of

he
and
forth
he
went
with
a
full
sober
cheer
out
at
the
door
and
after
then
came
she
and
to
the
people
he
said
in
this
mannere
this
is
my

quoth
he
that
standeth
here
honoure
her
and
love
her
i
you
pray
whoso

is
no
more
to

and
for
that
nothing
of
her
olde
gear
she
shoulde
bring
into
his
house
he
bade
that
women
should
her
right
there
of
which
these
ladies
were
nothing
glad
to
handle
her
clothes
wherein
she
was
clad
but
natheless
this
maiden
bright
of
hue
from
foot
to
head
they
clothed
have
all
new
her
haires
have
they
comb
that
lay
full
rudely
and
with
their
fingers
small
a
crown
upon
her
head
they
have
dress
and
set
her
full
of
nouches
great
and
small
of
her
array
why
should
i
make
a
tale
the
people
her
knew
for
her
fairness
when
she
transmuted
was
in
such
richess
the
marquis
hath
her
spoused
with
a
ring
brought
for
the
same
cause
and
then
her
set
upon
a
horse
and
well
ambling
and
to
his
palace
ere
he
longer
with
joyful
people
that
her
led
and
met
conveyed
her
and
thus
the
day
they
spend
in
revel
till
the
sunne
gan
descend
and
shortly
forth
this
tale
for
to
chase
i
say
that
to
this
newe
marchioness
god
hath
such
favour
sent
her
of
his
grace
that
it
ne
seemed
not
by
likeliness
that
she
was
born
and
fed
in
rudeness
as
in
a
cot
or
in
an
ox
stall
but
nourish
in
an
emperore
hall
to
every
wight
she
is
so
dear
and
worshipful
that
folk
where
she
was
born
that
from
her
birthe
knew
her
year
by
year
they
but
durst
have
sworn
that
to
janicol
of
whom
i
spake
before
she
was
not
daughter
for
by
conjecture
them
thought
she
was
another
creature
for
though
that
ever
virtuous
was
she
she
was
increased
in
such
excellence
of
good
in
high
bounte
and
so
discreet
and
fair
of
eloquence
so
benign
and
so
of
reverence
and
coulde
so
the
people
heart
embrace
that
each
her
lov
that
looked
on
her
face
not
only
of
saluces
in
the
town
published
was
the
bounte
of
her
name
but
eke
besides
in
many
a
regioun
if
one
said
well
another
said
the
same
so
spread
of
here
high
bounte
the
fame
that
men
and
women
young
as
well
as
old
went
to
saluces
her
for
to
behold
thus
walter
lowly
nay
but
royally
wedded
with
honestete
in
godde
peace
lived
full
easily
at
home
and
outward
grace
enough
had
he
and
for
he
saw
that
under
low
degree
was
honest
virtue
hid
the
people
him
held
a
prudent
man
and
that
is
seen
full
seld
not
only
this
griseldis
through
her
wit
all
the
of
wifely
homeliness
all
the
but
eke
when
that
the
case
required
it
the
common
profit
coulde
she
redress
there
discord
rancour
nor
heaviness
in
all
the
land
that
she
could
not
appease
and
wisely
bring
them
all
in
rest
and
ease
though
that
her
husband
absent
were
or
non
if
gentlemen
or
other
of
that
country
were
wroth
she
woulde
bringe
them
at
one
feud
so
wise
and
ripe
wordes
hadde
she
and
judgement
of
so
great
equity
that
she
from
heaven
sent
was
as
men
wend
imagined
people
to
save
and
every
wrong
not
longe
time
after
that
this
was
wedded
she
a
daughter
had
all
she
had
borne
a
child
glad
was
the
marquis
and
his
folk
therefore
for
though
a
maiden
child
came
all
before
she
may
unto
a
knave
child
attain
by
likelihood
since
she
is
not
barren
tertia
there
fell
as
falleth
many
times
mo
when
that
his
child
had
sucked
but
a
throw
little
while
this
marquis
in
his
hearte
longed
so
to
tempt
his
wife
her
for
to
know
that
he
might
not
out
of
his
hearte
throw
this
marvellous
desire
his
wife
needless
god
wot
he
thought
her
to
affray
cause
disturb
he
had
assayed
her
anough
before
and
found
her
ever
good
what
needed
it
her
for
to
tempt
and
always
more
and
more
though
some
men
praise
it
for
a
subtle
wit
but
as
for
me
i
say
that
it
ill
became
a
wife
when
that
it
is
no
need
and
putte
her
in
anguish
and
in
dread
for
which
this
marquis
wrought
in
this
mannere
he
came
at
night
alone
there
as
she
lay
with
sterne
face
and
with
full
troubled
cheer
and
saide
thus
griseld
quoth
he
that
day
that

of
your
poor

full
low
for
any
weal
you
must
yourselfe
know
take
heed
of
every
word

i
you
say
there
is
no
wight
that

it
but
we
tway
ye
know

well
how
that

that

heart
glad
was
the
marquis
for
her
answering
but
yet
he
feigned
as
he
were
not
so
all
dreary
was
his
cheer
and
his
looking
when
that
he
should
out
of
the
chamber
go
soon
after
this
a
furlong
way
or
two
he
privily
hath
told
all
his
intent
unto
a
man
and
to
his
wife

sent
a
was
this
man
of
the
which
he
faithful
often
founden
had
in
thinges
great
and
eke
such
folk
well
can
do
execution
in
thinges
bad
the
lord
knew
well
that
he
him
loved
and
drad
and
when
this
sergeant
knew
his
lorde
will
into
the
chamber
stalked
he
full
still
madam
he
said
ye
must
forgive
it
me
though
i
do
thing
to
which
i
am
constrain

be
so
wise
that
right
well

i
there

no
more
to
say

would
have
slain
it
ere

went
griseldis
must
all
suffer
and
consent
and
as
a
lamb
she
sat
there
meek
and
still
and
let
this
cruel
sergeant
do
his
will
was
the
of
this
man
reputation
suspect
his
face
suspect
his
word
also
suspect
the
time
in
which
he
this
began
alas
her
daughter
that
she
loved
so
she
he
would
have
it
slain
right
tho
but
natheless
she
neither
wept
nor
siked
conforming
her
to
what
the
marquis
liked
but
at
the
last
to
speake
she
began
and
meekly
she
unto
the
sergeant
pray
so
as
he
was
a
worthy
gentle
man
that
she
might
kiss
her
child
ere
that
it
died
and
in
her
this
little
child
she
laid
bosom
with
full
sad
face
and
gan
the
child
to
bless
and
lulled
it
and
after
gan
it
kiss
and
thus
she
said
in
her
benigne
voice
farewell
my
child
i
shall
thee
never
see
but
since
i
have
thee
marked
with
the
cross
of
that
father
thou
be
that
for
us
died
upon
a
cross
of
tree
thy
soul
my
little
child
i
betake
unto
for
this
night
shalt
thou
dien
for
my
sake
i
that
to
a
in
this
case
it
had
been
hard
this
for
to
see
sight
well
might
a
mother
then
have
cried
alas
but
natheless
so
sad
steadfast
was
she
that
she
endured
all
adversity
and
to
the
sergeant
meekely
she
said
have
here
again
your
little
younge
maid
go
now
quoth
she
and
do
my
lord
behest
and
one
thing
would
i
pray
you
of
your
grace
my
lord
forbade
you
at
the
least
bury
this
little
body
in
some
place
that
neither
beasts
nor
birdes
it
arace
but
he
no
word
would
to
that
purpose
say
but
took
the
child
and
went
upon
his
way
the
sergeant
came
unto
his
lord
again
and
of
griselda
words
and
of
her
he
told
him
point
for
point
in
short
and
plain
and
him
presented
with
his
daughter
dear
somewhat
this
lord
had
ruth
in
his
mannere
but
natheless
his
purpose
held
he
still
as
lordes
do
when
they
will
have
their
will
and
bade
this
sergeant
that
he
privily
shoulde
the
child
full
softly
wind
and
wrap
with
alle
circumstances
tenderly
and
carry
it
in
a
coffer
or
in
lap
but
upon
pain
his
head
off
for
to
swap
that
no
man
shoulde
know
of
his
intent
nor
whence
he
came
nor
whither
that
he
went
but
at
bologna
to
his
sister
dear
that
at
that
time
of
was
countess
he
should
it
take
and
shew
her
this
mattere
beseeching
her
to
do
her
business
this
child
to
foster
in
all
gentleness
and
whose
child
it
was
he
bade
her
hide
from
every
wight
for
aught
that
might
betide
the
sergeant
went
and
hath
fulfill
this
thing
but
to
the
marquis
now
returne
we
for
now
went
he
full
fast
imagining
if
by
his
wife
cheer
he
mighte
see
or
by
her
wordes
apperceive
that
she
were
changed
but
he
never
could
her
find
but
alike
and
kind
as
glad
as
humble
as
busy
in
service
and
eke
in
love
as
she
was
wont
to
be
was
she
to
him
in
every
wise
of
and
of
her
daughter
not
a
word
spake
she
accident
for
no
change
of
humour
resulting
was
seen
in
her
nor
her
daughter
name
from
her
she
named
or
in
earnest
or
in
game
in
this
estate
there
passed
be
four
year
ere
she
with
childe
was
but
as
god
a
child
she
bare
by
this
waltere
full
gracious
and
fair
for
to
behold
and
when
that
folk
it
to
his
father
told
not
only
he
but
all
his
country
merry
were
for
this
child
and
god
they
thank
and
hery
when
it
was
two
year
old
and
from
the
breast
of
the
norice
on
a
day
weaned
this
marquis
yet
another
seized
by
yet
to
tempt
his
wife
yet
farther
if
he
may
another
oh
needless
was
she
tempted
in
as
say
but
wedded
men
connen
no
measure
no
when
that
they
find
a
patient
creature
wife
quoth
the
marquis
ye
have
heard
ere
this
my
people
our
marriage
with
and
since
my
son
is
now
is
it
worse
than
ever
in
all
our
age
the
murmur
slays
mine
heart
and
my
corage
for
to
mine
ears
cometh
the
voice
so
smart
that
it
well
nigh
destroyed
hath
mine
heart
now
say
they
thus
walter
is
then
shall
the
blood
of
janicol
succeed
and
be
our
lord
for
other
have
we
none
such
wordes
say
my
people
out
of
drede
well
ought
i
of
such
murmur
take
heed
for
certainly
i
dread
all
such
sentence
of
opinion
though
they
not
in
mine
audience
in
my
i
woulde
live
in
peace
if
that
i
might
wherefore
i
am
disposed
utterly
as
i
his
sister
served
by
night
right
so
think
i
to
serve
him
privily
this
warn
i
you
that
ye
not
suddenly
out
of
yourself
for
no
woe
should
outraie
outrageous
rave
be
patient
and
thereof
i
you
pray
i
have
quoth
she
said
thus
and
ever
shall
i
will
no
thing
nor
no
thing
certain
but
as
you
list
not
grieveth
me
at
all
though
that
my
daughter
and
my
son
be
slain
at
your
commandement
that
is
to
sayn
i
have
not
had
no
part
of
children
twain
but
first
sickness
and
after
woe
and
pain
ye
be
my
lord
do
with
your
owen
thing
right
as
you
list
and
ask
no
rede
of
me
for
as
i
left
at
home
all
my
clothing
when
i
came
first
to
you
right
so
quoth
she
left
i
my
will
and
all
my
liberty
and
took
your
clothing
wherefore
i
you
pray
do
your
pleasance
i
will
your
obey
and
certes
if
i
hadde
prescience
your
will
to
know
ere
ye
your
me
told
i
would
it
do
withoute
negligence
but
now
i
know
your
lust
and
what
ye
all
your
pleasance
firm
and
stable
i
hold
for
wist
i
that
my
death
might
do
you
ease
right
gladly
would
i
dien
you
to
please
death
may
not
make
no
comparisoun
unto
your
love
and
when
this
marquis
the
constance
of
his
wife
he
cast
adown
his
eyen
two
and
wonder
how
she
may
in
patience
suffer
all
this
array
and
forth
he
went
with
dreary
countenance
but
to
his
heart
it
was
full
great
pleasance
this
ugly
sergeant
in
the
same
wise
that
he
her
daughter
caught
right
so
hath
he
or
worse
if
men
can
any
worse
devise
her
son
that
full
was
of
beauty
and
so
patient
was
she
that
she
no
cheere
made
of
heaviness
but
kiss
her
son
and
after
gan
him
bless
save
this
she
prayed
him
if
that
he
might
her
little
son
he
would
in
earthe
grave
his
tender
limbes
delicate
to
sight
from
fowles
and
from
beastes
for
to
save
but
she
none
answer
of
him
mighte
have
he
went
his
way
as
him
nothing
ne
raught
but
to
bologna
tenderly
it
brought
the
marquis
wonder
ever
longer
more
upon
her
patience
and
if
that
he
not
hadde
soothly
knowen
therebefore
that
perfectly
her
children
loved
she
he
would
have
that
of
some
subtilty
and
of
malice
or
for
cruel
corage
she
hadde
suffer
this
with
visage
unmoved
but
well
he
knew
that
next
himself
certain
she
lov
her
children
best
in
every
wise
but
now
of
women
would
i
aske
fain
if
these
assayes
mighte
not
suffice
what
could
a
husband
more
devise
to
prove
her
wifehood
and
her
steadfastness
and
he
continuing
in
sturdiness
but
there
be
folk
of
such
condition
that
when
they
have
a
certain
purpose
take
thiey
can
not
of
their
intention
but
right
as
they
were
bound
unto
a
stake
they
will
not
of
their
firste
purpose
slake
abate
right
so
this
marquis
fully
hath
to
tempt
his
wife
as
he
was
first
dispos
he
waited
if
by
word
or
countenance
that
she
to
him
was
changed
of
corage
but
never
could
he
finde
variance
she
was
aye
one
in
heart
and
in
visage
and
aye
the
farther
that
she
was
in
age
the
more
true
if
that
it
were
possible
she
was
to
him
in
love
and
more
penible
in
devotion
for
which
it
seemed
thus
that
of
them
two
there
was
but
one
will
for
as
walter
lest
the
same
pleasance
was
her
also
and
god
be
thanked
all
fell
for
the
best
she
shewed
well
for
no
worldly
unrest
a
wife
as
of
herself
no
thinge
should
will
in
effect
but
as
her
husbaud
would
the
of
walter
wondrous
wide
sprad
that
of
a
cruel
heart
he
wickedly
he
a
poore
woman
wedded
had
had
murder
both
his
children
privily
such
murmur
was
among
them
commonly
no
wonder
is
for
to
the
people
ear
there
came
no
word
but
that
they
murder
were
for
which
whereas
his
people
therebefore
had
lov
him
well
the
of
his
made
them
that
they
him
hated
therefore
to
be
a
is
a
hateful
name
but
natheless
for
earnest
or
for
game
he
of
his
cruel
purpose
would
not
stent
to
tempt
his
wife
was
set
all
his
intent
when
that
his
daughter
twelve
year
was
of
age
he
to
the
court
of
rome
in
subtle
wise
informed
of
his
will
sent
his
message
commanding
him
such
bulles
to
devise
as
to
his
cruel
purpose
may
suffice
how
that
the
pope
for
his
people
rest
bade
him
to
wed
another
if
him
lest
i
say
he
bade
they
shoulde
counterfeit
the
pope
bulles
making
mention
that
he
had
leave
his
firste
wife
to
lete
to
rancour
and
dissension
an
end
to
betwixt
his
people
and
him
thus
spake
the
bull
the
which
they
have
published
at
full
the
rude
people
as
no
wonder
is
full
well
that
it
had
been
right
so
believed
but
when
these
tidings
came
to
griseldis
i
deeme
that
her
heart
was
full
of
woe
but
she
alike
for
evermo
disposed
was
this
humble
creature
th
adversity
of
fortune
all
t
endure
abiding
ever
his
lust
and
his
pleasance
to
whom
that
she
was
given
heart
and
all
as
her
very
worldly
suffisance
the
utmost
extent
but
shortly
if
this
story
tell
i
shall
of
her
the
marquis
written
hath
in
special
a
letter
in
which
he
shewed
his
intent
and
secretly
it
to
bologna
sent
to
th
earl
of
panico
which
hadde
wedded
his
sister
pray
he
specially
to
bringe
home
again
his
children
two
in
honourable
estate
all
openly
but
one
thing
he
him
prayed
utterly
that
he
to
no
wight
though
men
would
inquere
shoulde
not
tell
whose
children
that
they
were
but
say
the
maiden
should
be
unto
the
marquis
of
saluce
anon
and
as
this
earl
was
prayed
so
did
he
for
at
day
set
he
on
his
way
is
gone
toward
saluce
and
lorde

his
mannere
and
thus
in
great
nobless
and
with
glad
cheer
toward
saluces
shaping
their
journey
from
day
to
day
they
rode
upon
their
way
quinta

this
after
his
wick
usage

marquis

wife
to
tempte
more

to
the
uttermost
proof
of
her
corage
fully
to
have
experience
and

that
whilom

i
will
go
when
you
lest
but
whereas
ye
me
proffer
such
dowaire
as
i
first
brought
it
is
well
in
my
mind
it
was
my
wretched
clothes
nothing
fair
the
which
to
me
were
hard
now
for
to
find
o
goode
god
how
gentle
and
how
kind
ye
seemed
by
your
speech
and
your
visage
the
day
that
maked
was
our
marriage
but
sooth
is
said
i
find
it
true
all
events
for
in
effect
it
proved
is
on
me
love
is
not
old
as
when
that
it
is
new
but
certes
lord
for
no
adversity
to
dien
in
this
case
it
shall
not
be
that
in
word
or
work
i
shall
repent
that
i
you
gave
mine
heart
in
whole
intent
my
lord
ye
know
that
in
my
father
place
ye
did
me
strip
out
of
my
poore
weed
and
richely
ye
clad
me
of
your
grace
to
you
brought
i
nought
elles
out
of
dread
but
faith
and
nakedness
and
maidenhead
and
here
again
your
clothing
i
restore
and
eke
your
wedding
ring
for
evermore
the
remnant
of
your
jewels
ready
be
within
your
chamber
i
dare
safely
sayn
naked
out
of
my
father
house
quoth
she
i
came
and
naked
i
must
turn
again
all
your
pleasance
would
i
follow
fain
but
yet
i
hope
it
be
not
your
intent
that
i
out
of
your
palace
went
ye
could
not
do
so
a
thing
that
womb
in
which
your
children
lay
shoulde
before
the
people
in
my
walking
be
seen
all
bare
and
therefore
i
you
pray
let
me
not
like
a
worm
go
by
the
way
remember
you
mine
owen
lord
so
dear
i
was
your
wife
though
i
unworthy
were
wherefore
in
of
my
maidenhead
which
that
i
brought
and
not
again
i
bear
as
vouchesafe
to
give
me
to
my
but
such
a
smock
as
i
was
wont
to
wear
that
i
therewith
may
the
womb
of
her
that
was
your
wife
and
here
i
take
my
leave
of
you
mine
owen
lord
lest
i
you
grieve
the
smock
quoth
he
that
thou
hast
on
thy
back
let
it
be
still
and
bear
it
forth
with
thee
but
well
thilke
word
he
spake
difficulty
but
went
his
way
for
ruth
and
for
pity
before
the
folk
herselfe
stripped
she
and
in
her
smock
with
foot
and
head
all
bare
toward
her
father
house
forth
is
she
fare
the
folk
her
follow
weeping
on
her
way
and
fortune
aye

evil
preveth
a

is
he
that
you

thus
saide
the
folk
in
that
city
when
that
the
people
gazed
up
and
down
for
they
were
glad
right
for
the
novelty
to
have
a

lady
of

no
more
of
this
now
make
i
mentioun
but
to
griseld
again
i
will
me
dress
and
tell
her
constancy
and
business
full
busy
was
griseld
in
thing
that
to
the

was
appertinent
right
nought
was
she
of

though
it
were
rude
and
somedeal
eke
but
with
glad
unto
the

she
went
with

to
greet
the

and
after
that
did
forth
her
business
with
so
glad
his
guestes
she
receiv
and
so
each
in
his
degree
skilfully
that
no
defaulte
no
man
apperceiv
but
aye
they
wonder
what
she
mighte
be
that
in
so
poor
array
was
for
to
see
and
such
honour
and
reverence
understood
and
worthily
they
praise
her
prudence
in
all
this
meane
while
she
not
this
maid
and
eke
her
brother
to
commend
with
all
her
heart
in
full
benign
intent
so
well
that
no
man
could
her

amend
but
at
the
last
when
that

sitte
down
to

he
gan
to
call
griseld
as
she
was

tenderly
and
to
my
supposing
she

creature
and
when
this
walter
saw
her
patience
her
gladde

at

he
so
often
had
her
done
offence

all
the

the
ladies
when
that
they
their
time
sey
have
taken
her
and
into
chamber
gone
and
stripped
her
out
of
her
rude
array
and
in
a
cloth
of
gold
that
brightly
shone
and
with
a
crown
of
many
a
riche
stone
upon
her
head
they
into
hall
her
brought
and
there
she
was
honoured
as
her
ought
thus
had
this
piteous
day
a
blissful
end
for
every
man
and
woman
did
his
might
this
day
in
mirth
and
revel
to
dispend
till
on
the
shone
the
starres
bright
for
more
solemn
in
every
mannes
sight
this
feaste
was
and
greater
of
costage
than
was
the
revel
of
her
marriage
full
many
a
year
in
high
prosperity
lived
these
two
in
concord
and
in
rest
and
richely
his
daughter
married
he
unto
a
lord
one
of
the
worthiest
of
all
itale
and
then
in
peace
and
rest
his
wife
father
in
his
court
he
kept
till
that
the
soul
out
of
his
body
crept
his
son
succeeded
in
his
heritage
in
rest
and
peace
after
his
father
day
and
fortunate
was
eke
in
marriage
he
put
not
his
wife
in
great
assay
this
world
is
not
so
strong
it
no
nay
to
be
as
it
hath
been
in
olde
times
yore
and
hearken
what
this
author
saith
therefore
this
story
is
said
not
for
that
wives
should
follow
griselda
in
humility
for
it
were
though
they
would
to
be
borne
but
for
that
every
wight
in
his
degree
shoulde
be
constant
in
adversity
as
was
griselda
therefore
petrarch
writeth
this
story
which
with
high
style
he
inditeth
for
since
a
woman
was
so
patient
unto
a
mortal
man
well
more
we
ought
receiven
all
in
that
god
us
sent
great
skill
is
he
proved
that
he
wrought
note
but
he
tempteth
no
man
that
he
hath
bought
as
saith
saint
james
if
ye
his
read
he
proveth
folk
all
day
it
is
no
dread
and
suffereth
us
for
our
exercise
with
sharpe
scourges
of
adversity
full
often
to
be
beat
in
sundry
wise
not
for
to
know
our
will
for
certes
he
ere
we
were
born
knew
all
our
frailty
and
for
our
best
is
all
his
governance
let
us
then
live
in
virtuous
sufferance
but
one
word
lordings
hearken
ere
i
go
it
were
full
hard
to
finde
in
all
a
town
griseldas
three
or
two
for
if
that
they
were
put
to
such
assays
the
gold
of
them
hath
now
so
bad
with
brass
that
though
the
coin
be
fair
eye
it
woulde
rather
break
in
two
than
ply
for
which

and
all
her

let
us

my
song
that
saith
in

mannere
of

griseld
is
dead
and
eke
her
patience
and
both
at
once
are
buried
in

for
which
i
cry
in

no

man
so
hardy
be
t
assail
his

to
find
griselda

wives
in

translated
the
charming

of

of

decameron
and
chaucer
has
closely
followed
petrarch
translation
made
in

before
that
in
which
he
died
the
fact
that
the
embassy
to
genoa
on
which
chaucer
was
sent
took
place
in
has
lent
countenance
to
the
opinion
that
the
english
poet
did
actually
visit
the
italian
bard
at
padua
and
hear
the
story
from
his
own
lips
this
however
is
only
a
probability

it
is
a

the

this
is
one
of
the
most
licentious
corruptions
of
orthography
says
tyrwhitt
that
i
remember
to
have
observed
in
chaucer
but
such
liberties
were
common
among
the
european
poets
of
his
time
when
there
was
an
extreme
lack
of
certainty
in
orthography
the
fourteen
lines
that
follow
are
translated
almost
literally
from
petrarch
latin
for
great
skill
is
he
proved
that
he
wrought
for
it
is
most
reasonable
that
he
should
prove
or
test
that
which
he
made
chichevache
in
old
popular
fable
was
a
monster
that
fed
only
on
good
women
and
was
always
very
thin
from
scarcity
of
such
food
a
corresponding
monster
bycorne
fed
only
on
obedient
and
kind
husbands
and
was
always
fat
the
origin
of
the
fable
was
french
but
lydgate
has
a
ballad
on
the
subject
chichevache
literally
means
niggardly
or
greedy
cow

something

i
that

that
all
his

wifeless
hath
been

that

into

could
in

telle
so
much

as
i
you

could

of

so
god
you

since
ye
so
muche
knowen
of
that

full
heartily
i
pray
you
tell
us

gladly
quoth
he
but
of
mine
owen
sore
for
sorry
heart
i
telle
may
no
more
notes
to
the
prologue
to
the
merchant
tale
though
the
manner
in
which
the
merchant
takes
up
the
closing
words
of
the
envoy
to
the
clerk
tale
and
refers
to
the
patience
of
griselda
seems
to
prove
beyond
doubt
that
the
order
of
the
tales
in
the
text
is
the
right
one
yet
in
some
manuscripts
of
good
authority
the
franklin
tale
follows
the
clerk
and
the
envoy
is
concluded
by
this
stanza
this
worthy
clerk
when
ended
was
his
tale
our
hoste
said
and
swore
by
cocke
bones
lever
were
than
a
barrel
of
ale
my
wife
at
home
had
heard
this
legend
once
this
is
a
gentle
tale
for
the
nonce
as
to
my
purpose
wiste
ye
my
will
but
thing
that
will
not
be
let
it
be
still
in
other
manuscripts
of
less
authority
the
host
proceeds
in
two
similar
stanzas
to
impose
a
tale
on
the
franklin
but
tyrwhitt
is
probably
right
in
setting
them
aside
as
spurious
and
in
admitting
the
genuineness
of
the
first
only
if
it
be
supposed
that
chaucer
forgot
to
cancel
it
when
he
had
decided
on
another
mode
of
connecting
the
merchant
with
the
clerk
tale
saint
thomas
of
ind
thomas
the
apostle
who
was
believed
to
have
travelled
in
india
the
l
whilom
there
was
dwelling
in
lombardy
a
worthy
knight
that
born
was
at
pavie
in
which
he
liv
in
great
prosperity
and
forty
years
a
wifeless
man
was
he
and
follow
aye
his
bodily
delight
on
women
where
as
was
his
appetite
as
do
these
fooles
that
be
and
when
that
he
was
passed
sixty
years
were
it
for
holiness
or
for
dotage
i
can
not
say
but
such
a
great
hadde
this
knight
to
be
a
wedded
man
that
day
and
night
he
did
all
that
he
can
to
espy
where
that
he
might
wedded
be
praying
our
lord
to
grante
him
that
he
mighte
once
knowen
of
that
blissful
life
that
is
betwixt
a
husband
and
his
wife
and
for
to
live
under
that
holy
bond
with
which
god
firste
man
and
woman
bond
none
other
life
said
he
is
worth
a
bean
for
wedlock
is
so
easy
and
so
clean
that
in
this
world
it
is
a
paradise
thus
said
this
olde
knight
that
was
so
wise
and
certainly
as
as
god
is
king
to
take
a
wife
it
is
a
glorious
thing
and
when
a
man
is
old
and
hoar
then
is
a
wife
the
fruit
of
his
treasor
then
should
he
take
a
young
wife
and
a
fair
on
which
he
might
engender
him
an
heir
and
lead
his
life
in
joy
and
in
solace
delight
whereas
these
bachelors
singen
alas
when
that
they
find
any
adversity
in
love
which
is
but
childish
vanity
and
truely
it
well
to
be
so
befits
that
bachelors
have
often
pain
and
woe
on
brittle
ground
they
build
and
brittleness
they
finde
when
they
sickerness
that
there
they
live
but
as
a
bird
or
as
a
beast
is
in
liberty
and
under
no
arrest
control
whereas
a
wedded
man
in
his
estate
liveth
a
life
blissful
and
ordinate
under
the
yoke
of
marriage
well
may
his
heart
in
joy
and
bliss
abound
for
who
can
be
so
as
a
wife
who
is
so
true
and
eke
so
attentive
to
him
sick
and
whole
as
is
his
make
for
for
weal
or
woe
she
will
him
not
forsake
she
is
not
weary
him
to
love
and
serve
though
that
he
lie
bedrid
until
he
sterve
and
yet
some
clerkes
say
it
is
not
so
of
which
he
theophrast
is
one
of
tho
though
theophrast
list
for
to
lie
take
no
wife
quoth
he
for
husbandry
as
for
to
spare
in
household
thy
dispence
a
true
servant
doth
more
diligence
thy
good
to
keep
than
doth
thine
owen
wife
for
she
will
claim
a
half
part
all
her
life
and
if
that
thou
be
sick
so
god
me
save
thy
very
friendes

a

knave
will
keep
thee

on

foolishly
dispended
blessed
be
god
that
it
shall
be

for
i
will
be
certain
a

and
that
anon
in
all
the
haste
i
can
unto
some
maiden
fair
and
tender
of
age
i
pray
you
for
my

arrange
contrive
all
suddenly
for
i
will
not
abide
and
i
will
to
espy
on

i
may

but
forasmuch
as
ye
be
more
than
ye
shalle
such
a

espy
than
i
and
where
me
best
were
to
ally
but
one
thing
warn
i
you
my
friendes
dear
i
will
none
old
wife
have
in
no
mannere
she
shall
not
passe
sixteen
year
certain
old
fish
and
younge
flesh
would
i
have
fain
better
quoth
he
a
pike
than
a
pickerel
pike
and
better
than
old
beef
is
tender
veal
i
will
no
woman
thirty
year
of
age
it
is
but
beanestraw
and
great
forage
and
eke
these
olde
widows
god
it
wot
they
so
much
craft
on

muche
brooke
harm
when
that
them
lest
can
do
so
much
that
with
them
should
i
never
live
in
rest
harm
when
they
for
sundry
schooles
make
subtle
clerkes
woman
of
many
schooles
half
a
clerk
is
but
certainly
a
young
thing
men
may
guy
right
as
men
may
warm
wax
with
handes
ply
mould
wherefore
i
say
you
plainly
in
a
clause
i
will
none
old
wife
have
right
for
this
cause
for
if
so
were
i
hadde
such
mischance
that
i
in
her
could
have
no
pleasance
then
should
i
lead
my
life
in
avoutrie
and
go
straight
to
the
devil
when
i
die
nor
children
should
i
none
upon
her
getten
yet
me
houndes
had
me
eaten
would
than
that
mine
heritage
shoulde
fall
in
strange
hands
and
this
i
tell
you
all
i
doubte
not
i
know
the
cause
why
men
shoulde
wed
and
farthermore
know
i
there
speaketh
many
a
man
of
marriage
that
knows
no
more
of
it
than
doth
my
page
for
what
causes
a
man
should
take
a
wife
if
he
ne
may
not
live
chaste
his
life
take
him
a
wife
with
great
devotion
because
of
lawful
procreation
of
children
to
th
honour
of
god
above
and
not
only
for
paramour
or
love
and
for
they
shoulde
lechery
eschew
and
yield
their
debte
when
that
it
is
due
or
for
that
each
of
them
should
help
the
other
in
mischief
as
a
sister
shall
the
brother
and
live
in
chastity
full
holily
but
sires
by
your
leave
that
am
not
i
for
god
be
thanked
i
dare
make
avaunt
i

my
limbes

suffisant
to

all
that
a

what
i
may
do
though

are
as
green
as

wise
saith
that
a
man
ought
him
right
well
advise
to
whom
he
gives
his
hand
or
his
chattel
and
since
i
ought
advise
me
right
well
to
whom
i
give
my
good
away
from

well
more
i
ought
advise
me
pardie
to
whom
i
give
my

for
alway
i
warn

well
it
is
no
childe
play

inquire

is
mine
assent

wise
or
sober
or
dronkelew
to

or
proud
or
any
other
ways
a
shrew
a
chidester
or

or
rich
or
poor
or

a

wood
albeit
so
that

world
that
whole
in
all
sound
in
no
man
nor
beast
such
as
men
can
devise
every
but
nathehess
it
ought
enough
suffice
with
any
wife
if
so
were
that
she
had
more
goode
than
her
vices
bad
qualities
and
all
this
asketh
leisure
to
inquere
for
god
it
wot
i
have
wept
many
a
tear
full
privily
since
i
have
had
a
wife
praise
whoso
will

manne
life
certes
i
find
in
it
but
cost

of
all
blisses
bare
and
yet
god
wot
my
neighebours
about
and
of
women
many
a
rout
say
that
i
have
the
moste
steadfast
wife
and
eke
the
meekest
one
that
beareth

gan
in
the
soul
themselves
of
january
about
his
marriage
many
a
fair
shape
and
many
a
fair
visage
there
passed
through
his
hearte
night
by
night
as
whoso
took
a
mirror
polish
bright
and
set
it
in
a
common
then
should
he
see
many
a
figure
pace
by

and
in
the

wise
gan

in
his

devise
of
maidens
which
that
dwelte
him
beside
he
wiste
not
where
that
he
might

fix
his
choice
for
if
that
one
had
beauty
in

another
stood
so
in
the
people
grace
for
her
and
her
benignity
that
of
the
people
greatest
voice
had
she
and
some
were
rich
and
had
a
badde
name
but
natheless
betwixt
earnest
and
game
he
at
the
last
appointed
him
on
one
and
let
all
others
from
his
hearte
gon
and
chose
her
of
his
own
authority
for
love
is
blind
all
day
and
may
not
see
and
when
that
he
was
into
bed
he
pourtray
in
his
heart
and
in
his
thought
her
freshe
beauty
and
her
age
tender
her
middle
small
her
armes
long
and
slender
her
wise
governance
her
gentleness
her
womanly
bearing
and
her
sadness
and
when
that
he
her
was
condescended
selected
he
thought
his
choice
might
not
be
amended
for
when
that
he
himself
concluded
had
he
thought
each
other
manne
s
wit
so
bad
that
impossible
it
were
to
reply
against
his
choice
this
was
his
fantasy
his
friendes
sent
he
to
at
his
instance
and
prayed
them
to
do
him
that
pleasance
that
hastily
they
would
unto
him
come
he
would
abridge
their
labour
all
and
some
needed
no
more
for
them
to
go
nor
ride
was
appointed
where
he
would
abide
had
definitively
placebo
came
and
eke
his
friendes
soon
made
his
and
he
bade
them
all
a
boon
of
all
he
asked
that
none
of
them
no
arguments
would
make
a
favour
of
against
the
purpose
that
he
had
which
purpose
was
pleasant
to
god
said
he
and
very
ground
of
his
prosperity
he
said
there
was
a
maiden
in
the
town
which
that
of
beauty
hadde
great
renown
were
it
so
she
were
of
small
degree
sufficed
him
her
youth
and
her
beauty
which
maid
he
said
he
would
have
to
his
wife
to
lead
in
ease
and
holiness
his
life
and
thanked
god
that
he
might
have
her
all
that
no
wight
with
his
blisse
shall
a
share
and
prayed
them
to
labour
in
this
need
and
shape
that
he
faile
not
to
speed
for
then
he
said
his
spirit
was
at
ease
then
is
quoth
he
nothing
may
me
displease
save
one
thing
pricketh
in
my
conscience
the
which
i
will
rehearse
in
your
presence
i
have
quoth
he
heard
said
full
ago
there
may
no
man
have
perfect
blisses
two
this
is
to
say
on
earth
and
eke
in
heaven
for
though
he
keep
him
from
the
sinne
seven
and
eke
from
every
branch
of
thilke
tree
yet
is
there
so
perfect
felicity
and
so
great
and
lust
in
marriage
and
that
i
am
aghast
now
in
mine
age
afraid
that
i
shall
head
now
so
merry
a
life
so
delicate
withoute
woe
or
strife
that
i
shall
have
mine
on
earthe
here
for
since
that
very
is
bought
so
dear
with
tribulation
and
great
penance
how
should
i
then
living
in
such
pleasance
as
alle
wedded
men
do
with
their
wives
come
to
the
bliss
where
christ
on
live
is
this
is
my
dread
and
ye
my
brethren
tway
me
this
question
i
you
pray
answer
justinus
which
that
hated
his
folly
answer
anon
right
in
his
japery
jesting
way
and
for
he
would
his
longe
tale
abridge
he
woulde
no
allege
texts
but
saide
sir
so
there
be
none
obstacle
other
than
this
god
of
his
high
miracle
and
of
his
mercy
may
so
for
you
wirch
that
ere
ye
have
your
rights
of
holy
church
ye
may
repent
of
wedded
manne
life
in
which
ye
say
there
is
no
woe
nor
strife
and
elles
god
forbid
he
sent
a
wedded
man
his
grace
him
to
repent
well
often
rather
than
a
single
man
and
therefore
sir
beste
rede
i
can
is
the
best
counsel
despair
you
not
but
have
in
your
memory
that
i
paraventure
she
may
be
your
purgatory
she
may
be
godde
means
and
godde
whip
and
then
your
soul
shall
up
to
heaven
skip
swifter
than
doth
an
arrow
from
a
bow
i
hope
to
god
hereafter
ye
shall
know
that
there
is
none
so
great
felicity
in
marriage
nor
ever
more
shall
be
that
you
shall
of
your
salvation
so
that
ye
use
as
skill
is
and
reason
the
of
your
wife
attemperly
and
that
ye
please
her
not
too
amorously
and
that
ye
keep
you
eke
from
other
sin
my
tale
is
done
for
my
wit
is
but
thin
be
not
hereof
my
brother
dear
afraid
but
let
us
waden
out
of
this
mattere
the
wife
of
bath
if
ye
have
understand
of
marriage
which
ye
have
now
in
hand
declared
hath
full
well
in
little
space
fare
ye
now
well
god
have
you
in
his
grace
and
with
this
word
this
justin
and
his
brother
have
their
leave
and
each
of
them
of
other
and
when
they
saw
that
it
must
needes
be
they
wroughte
so
by
sleight
and
wise
treaty
that
she
this
maiden
which
that
hight
named
as
hastily
as
ever
that
she
might
shall
wedded
be
unto
this
january
i
trow
it
were
too
longe
you
to
tarry
if
i
told
you
of
every
and
by
which
she
was
feoffed
in
his
hand
or
for
to
reckon
of
her
rich
array
but
finally
is
the
day
that
to
the
churche
bothe
be
they
went
for
to
receive
the
holy
sacrament
forth
came
the
priest
with
stole
about
his
neck
and
bade
her
be
like
sarah
and
in
wisdom
and
in
truth
of
marriage
and
said
his
orisons
as
is
usage
and
them
and
prayed
god
should
them
bless
and
made
all
enough
with
holiness
thus
be
they
wedded
with
solemnity
and
at
the
feaste
sat
both
he
and
she
with
other
worthy
folk
upon
the
dais
all
full
of
joy
and
bliss
is
the
palace
and
full
of
instruments
and
of
vitaille
food
the
moste
of
all
itale
before
them
stood
such
instruments
of
soun
that
orpheus
nor
of
thebes
amphioun
ne
made
never
such
a
melody
at
every
course
came
in
loud
minstrelsy
that
never
joab
trumped
for
to
hear
nor
he

yet
half
so
clear
at
thebes
when
the
city
was
in
doubt

laughed
upon
every

firebrand
in
her
hand

before
the

of
her
beauty

full
filled
of
all
beauty
and
pleasance
this
january

ravish
in
a
trance
at
every
time
he
looked
in
her
face
but
in
his
heart

gan
her
to
menace
that
he
that
night
in

would
her
strain
harder
than
ever
paris
did
helene
but
natheless
yet
had
he
great
pity
that

must
he
and
thought
alas
o
tender
creature
now
woulde

mighte
well
endure
all
my
courage
it
is
so
sharp
and
keen

and
that
the
night
would
lasten
evermo
i
would
that

and
finally
he
did
all
his
labour
as
he
best
mighte
saving
his
honour
to
haste
them
from
the
meat
in
subtle
wise
the
time
came
that
reason
was
to
rise
and
after
that
men
dance
and
drinke
fast
and
spices
all
about
the
house
they
cast
and
full
of
joy
and
bliss
is
every

but
a
squire
that
highte
damian
who
carv
before
the
knight
full
many
a

was
so
ravish
on
his

for
the
very
pain
he
was
nigh

swooned
where
he
stood
so
sore
had
venus
hurt
him
with
her
brand
as
that
she
bare
it
dancing
in
her
hand
and
to
his
bed
he
went
him
hastily
no
more
of
him
as
at
this
time
speak
i
but
there
i
let
him
weep
enough
and
plain
till

pain
o
perilous
fire
that
in

wise
and
they
have
done
right
as

will
devise
men

and
the
draw
anon
the
bride
is
brought
to

as
still
as
stone
and
when
the
bed
was
with
the
priest

of
the
chamber
every
wight

dress
and
january
hath
fast
in
arms
his
freshe
may
his
paradise

make
he
lulled
her
he
kissed
her
full
oft
with
thicke
bristles
of
his
beard
unsoft
like
to
the
skin
of
houndfish
sharp
as
for
he
was
all
new
in
his
mannere
he
rubbed
her
upon
her
tender
face
and
saide
thus
alas
i
must
trespace
to
you
my
spouse
and
you
greatly
offend
ere

will
down
descend
but
natheless
consider
this
quoth
he
there
is
no
workman
he
be
that
may
both
worke
well
and
hastily
this
will
be
done
at
leisure
perfectly
it
is
how
longe
that
we
play
in
true
wedlock
coupled
be
we
tway
and
blessed
be
the
yoke
that
we
be
in

our
actes
may

may
do
no
sinne
with
his
wife
nor
hurt
himselfe
with
his
owen
knife
for
we
have
leave
to
play
us
by
the
law
thus
labour
he
till
that
the
day
gan
daw
and
then
he
took
a
sop
in
fine
clarre
and
upright
in
his
bedde
then
sat
he
and
after
that
he
sang
full
loud

side
sat
full
soft
he
took
her
and
he
kissed
her
full
oft
and
laid
him
down

and
that
anon
she
feigned
her
as
that
she
muste
gon
there
as
ye
know
that
every
wight
must
need
and
when
she
of
this
bill
had
taken
heed
she
rent
it
all
to
at
the
last
and
in
the
privy
softely
it
cast
who
now
but
faire
freshe
may
thoughtful
adown
by
olde
january
she
lay
that
slepte
till
the
cough
had
him
awaked
anon
he
pray
her
strippe
her
all
naked
he
would
of
her
he
said
have
some
pleasance
and
said
her
clothes
did
him
incumbrance
and
she
obey
him
be
her
or
loth
or
but
lest
that
folk
be
with
me
wroth
how
that
he
wrought
i
dare
not
to
you
tell
or
whether
she
thought
it
paradise
or
hell
but
there
i
let
them
worken
in
their
wise
till
evensong
ring
and
they
must
arise
were
it
by
destiny
or
aventure
chance
were
it
by
influence
or
by
nature
or
constellation
that
in
such
estate
the
heaven
stood
at
that
time
fortunate
as
for
to
put
a
bill
of
venus
works
for
alle
thing
hath
time
as
say
these
clerks
to
any
woman
for
to
get
her
love
i
can
not
say
but
greate
god
above
that
knoweth
that
none
act
is
causeless
of
all
for
i
will
hold
my
peace
him
but
sooth
is
this
how
that
this
freshe
may
hath
taken
such
impression
that
day
of
pity
on
this
sicke
damian
that
from
her
hearte
she
not
drive
can
the
remembrance
for
do
him
ease
satisfy
certain
thought
she
whom
that
this
thing
displease
his
i
recke
not
for
here
i
him
assure
to
love
him
best
of
any
creature
though
he
no
more
haddee
than
his
shirt
lo
pity
runneth
soon
in
gentle
heart
here
may
ye
see
how
excellent
in
women
is
when
they
them
advise
some
tyrant
is
as
there
be
many
a
one
that
hath
a
heart
as
hard
as
any
stone
which
would
have
let
him
in
the
place
well
rather
than
have
granted
him
her
grace
and
then
rejoicen
in
her
cruel
pride
and
reckon
not
to
be
a
homicide
this
gentle
may
full
filled
of
pity
right
of
her
hand
a
letter
maked
she
in
which
she
granted
him
her
very
grace
there
lacked
nought
but
only
day
and
place
where
that
she
might
unto
his
lust
suffice
for
it
shall
be
right
as
he
will
devise
and
when
she
saw
her
time
upon
a
day
to
visit
this
damian
went
this
may
and
subtilly
this
letter
down
she
thrust
under
his
pillow
read
it
if
him
lust
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
hard
him
twist
so
secretly
that
no
wight
of
it
wist
and
bade
him
be
all
whole
and
forth
she
went
to
january
when
he
for
her
sent
up
rose
damian
the
nexte
morrow
all
passed
was
his
sickness
and
his
sorrow
he
combed
him
he
proined
him
and
picked
he
did
all
that
unto
his
lady
liked
and
eke
to
january
he
went
as
low
as
ever
did
a
dogge
for
the
he
is
so
pleasant
unto
every
man
for
craft
is
all
whoso
that
do
it
can
every
wight
is
fain
to
speak
him
good
and
fully
in
his
lady
grace
he
stood
thus
leave
i
damian
about
his
need
and
in
my
tale
forth
i
will
proceed
some
holde
that
felicity
scholars
stands
in
delight
and
therefore
certain
he
this
noble
january
with
all
his
might
in
honest
wise
as
to
a
knight
him
to
live
full
deliciously
arranged
his
housing
his
array
as
suitably
to
his
degree
was
maked
as
a
king
amonges
other
of
his
honest
things
he
had
a
garden
walled
all
with
stone
so
fair
a
garden
wot
i
nowhere
none
for
out
of
doubt
i
verily
suppose
that
he
that
wrote
the
romance
of
the
rose
could
not
of
it
the
beauty
well
devise
nor
priapus
mighte
not
well
suffice
though
he
be
god
of
gardens
for
to
tell
the
beauty
of
the
garden
and
the
that
stood
under
a
laurel
always
green
full
often
time
he
pluto
and
his
queen
proserpina
and
all
their
faerie
disported
them
and
made
melody
about
that
well
and
danced
as
men
told
this
noble
knight
this
january
old
such
had
in
it
to
walk
and
play
that
he
would
suffer
no
wight
to
bear
the
key
save
he
himself
for
of
the
small
wicket
he
bare
always
of
silver
a
cliket
with
which
when
that
him
list
he
it
unshet
and
when
that
he
would
pay
his
wife
debt
in
summer
season
thither
would
he
go
and
may
his
wife
and
no
wight
but
they
two
and
thinges
which
that
were
not
done
in
bed
he
in
the
garden
them
perform
and
sped
and
in
this
wise
many
a
merry
day
lived
this
january
and
fresh
may
but
worldly
joy
may
not
always
endure
to
january
nor
to
no
creatucere
o
sudden
hap
o
thou
fortune
unstable
like
to
the
scorpion
so
deceivable
that
with
thy
head
when
thou
wilt
sting
thy
tail
is
death
through
thine
envenoming
o
brittle
joy
o
sweete
poison
quaint
o
monster
that
so
subtilly
canst
paint
thy
giftes
under
hue
of
steadfastness
that
thou
deceivest
bothe
and
less
and
why
hast
thou
january
thus
deceiv
that
haddest
him
for
thy
full
friend
receiv
and
now
thou
hast
bereft
him
both
his
eyen
for
sorrow
of
which
desireth
he
to
dien
alas
this
noble
january
free
amid
his
and
his
prosperity
is
waxen
blind
and
that
all
suddenly
he
weeped
and
he
wailed
piteously
and
therewithal
the
fire
of
jealousy
lest
that
his
wife
should
fall
in
some
folly
so
burnt
his
hearte
that
he
woulde
fain
that
some
man
bothe
him
and
her
had
slain
for
neither
after
his
death
nor
in
his
life
ne
would
he
that
she
were
no
love
nor
wife
but
ever
live
as
widow
in
clothes
black
sole
as
the
turtle
that
hath
lost
her
make
but
at
the
last
after
a
month
or
tway
his
sorrow
gan
assuage
soothe
to
say
for
when
he
wist
it
might
none
other
be
he
patiently
took
his
adversity
save
out
of
doubte
he
may
not
foregon
that
he
was
jealous
which
jealousy
was
so
outrageous
that
neither
in
hall
nor
in
none
other
house
nor
in
none
other
place
never
the
he
woulde
suffer
her
to
ride
or
go
that
he
had
hand
on
her
alway
for
which
full
often
wepte
freshe
may
that
loved
damian
so
burningly
that
she
must
either
dien
suddenly
or
elles
she
must
have
him
as
her
lest
she
when
her
hearte
woulde
brest
upon
that
other
side
damian
becomen
is
the
sorrowfullest
man
that
ever
was
for
neither
night
nor
day
he
mighte
speak
a
word
to
freshe
may
as
to
his
purpose
of
no
such
mattere
that
january
must
it
hear
that
had
a
hand
upon
her
evermo
but
natheless
by
writing
to
and
fro
and
privy
signes
wist
he
what
she
meant
and
she
knew
eke
the
of
his
intent
aim
o
january
what
might
it
thee
avail
though
thou
might
see
as
far
as
shippes
sail
for
as
good
is
it
blind
deceiv
to
be
as
be
deceived
when
a
man
may
see
lo
argus
which
that
had
a
hundred
eyen
for
all
that
ever
he
could
pore
or
pryen
yet
was
he
blent
and
god
wot
so
be
mo
that
that
it
be
not
so
pass
over
is
an
ease
i
say
no
more
this
freshe
may
of
which
i
spake
yore
in
warm
wax
hath
the
an
impression
that
january
bare
of
the
small
wicket
of
the
by
which
into
his
garden
oft
he
went
and
damian
that
knew
all
her
intent
the
cliket
counterfeited
privily
there
is
no
more
to
say
but
hastily
some
wonder
by
this
cliket
shall
betide
which
ye
shall
hearen
if
ye
will
abide
o
noble
ovid
sooth
thou
god
wot
what
sleight
is
it
if

be
long
and
hot
that
he
not
find
it
out
in
some
mannere
by
pyramus
and
thisbe
may
men
lear
though
they
were
kept
full
long
and
strait
all
they
be
accorded
through
a
wall
where
no
wight
could
have
found
out
such
a
sleight
but
now
to
purpose
ere
that

eight
were
passed
of
the
month
of

she
began
and
with
her
finger
signe
made
she
that
damian
should
climb
upon
a
tree
that
charged

and
up

for
verily
he
knew

and
every
signe
that
she
coulde

the
day
and
blue
the

phoebus
of

his
streames
down
had
sent
to
gladden
every

his
warmness
he
was
that
time
in
geminis
i
guess
but
little
from
his
declination
of
cancer
jove
exaltation
and
so
befell
in
that
bright
that
in
the
garden
on
the
farther

pluto
that
is
the
king
of
faerie
and
many
a
lady
in
his
company
following
his

the
queen
proserpina
which
that
he
ravished
out
of
ethna
while
that
she
gather
flowers
in
the
mead
in
claudian
ye
may
the
story
read
how
in
his
grisly
chariot
he
her
this
king
of
faerie
adown
him
set
upon
a
bank
of
turfes
fresh

green
and
right
anon
thus
said
he
to
his
queen
my
wife
quoth
he
there
may
no
wight
say
nay
experience
so
proves
it
every
day
the
treason
which
that

a
thousand

thus
said
this
king
that
knew
your
wickedness
and
jesus
filius
sirach
as
i

he
spake
of
you
but
seldom
reverence

confounded
what
recketh
me
of

i

well
that
this
jew
this
solomon
found
of

women
fooles
many
one
but
though
that
he
founde
no
good
woman
yet
there
hath
found
many
another
man
women
full
good
and
true
and
virtuous
witness
on
them
that
dwelt
in
christes
house
with
martyrdom
they
proved
their
constance
the
roman
gestes
make
remembrance
of
many
a
very
true
wife
also
but
sire
be
not
wroth
albeit
so
though
that
he
said
he
found
no
good
woman
i
pray
you
take
the
of
the
man
real
meaning
he
meant
thus
that
in
goodness
is
none
but
god
no
neither
nor
she
nor
hey
for
the
very
god
that
is
but
one
why
make
ye
so
much
of
solomon
what
though
he
made
a
temple
godde
house
what
though
he
were
rich
and
glorious
so
made
he
eke
a
temple
of
false
goddes
how
might
he
do
a
thing
that
more
is
pardie
as
fair

he
was
a
lechour
and
an

and
in

if

for
his

sake
he
should
have
lost
his

who

he
he
kissed

full
oft
and
on
her
womb
he
stroked
her
full
soft
and
to
his
palace
home
he
hath

lad
now
goode
men
i
pray
you
to
be
glad
thus
endeth
here
my
tale
of
january
god
bless
us
and
his
mother
sainte
mary
notes
to
the
merchant
tale
if
as
is
probable
this
tale
was
translated
from
the
french
the
original
is
not
now
extant
tyrwhitt
remarks
that
the
scene
is
laid
in
italy
but
none
of
the
names
except
damian
and
justin
seem
to
be
italian
but
rather
made
at
pleasure
so
that
i
doubt
whether
the
story
be
really
of
italian
growth
the
adventure
of
the
i
find
in
a
small
collection
of
latin
fables
written
by
one
adoiphus
in
elegiac
verses
of
his
fashion
in
the
year
whatever
was
the
real
origin
of
the
tale
the
machinery
of
the
fairies
which
chaucer
has
used
so
happily
was
probably
added
by
himself
and
indeed
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
his
pluto
and
proserpina
were
the
true
progenitors
of
oberon
and
titania
or
rather
that
they
themselves
have
once
at
least
deigned
to
revisit
our
poetical
system
under
the
latter
names
seculeres
of
the
laity
but
perhaps
since
the
word
is
of
fold
meaning
chaucer
intends
a
hit
at
the
secular
clergy
who
unlike
the
regular
orders
did
not
live
separate
from
the
world
but
shared
in
all
its
interests
and
pleasures
all
the
more
easily
and
freely
that
they
had
not
the
civil
restraint
of
marriage
this
and
the
next
eight
lines

taken

in

underwent
a

performed
many

the

lost

therefore
the
exact

of
the

uncertain

mr

seems
to
be
warranted

supposing
that

were
cited
as
examples

cunning

ecclesiastes
vii
jesus
the
son
of
sirach
to
whom
is
ascribed
one
of
the
books
of
the
apochrypha
that
called
the
wisdom
of
jesus
the
son
of
sirach
or
ecclesiasticus
in
which
especially
in
the
ninth
and
chapters
severe
cautions
are
given
against
women
roman
gestes
histories
such
as
those
of
lucretia
porcia
may
means
january
to
believe
that
she
is
pregnant
and
that
she
has
a
craving
for
unripe
pears
at
this
point
and
again
some
twenty
lines
below
several
verses
of
a
very
coarse
character
had
been
inserted
in
later
manuscripts
but
they
are
evidently
spurious
and
are
omitted
in
the
best
editions
store
is
the
general
reading
here
but
its
meaning
is
not
obvious
stowre
is
found
in
several
manuscripts
it
signifies
struggle
or
resist
and
both
for
its
own
appropriateness
and
for
the
force
which
it
gives
the
word
stronge
the
reading
in
the
text
seems
the
better
the
squire

the

to
the
squire
tale
women
connen
utter
such
chaffare
women
are
adepts
at
giving
circulation
to
such
wares
the
host
evidently
means
that
his
wife
would
be
sure
to
hear
of
his
confessions
from
some
female
member
of
the
company
the
prima
at
sarra
in
the
land
of
tartary
there
dwelt
a
king
that
russie
war
on
through
which
there
died
many
a
doughty
man
this
noble
king
was
called
cambuscan
which
in
his
time
was
of
so
great
renown
that
there
was
nowhere
in
no
regioun
so
excellent
a
lord
in
alle
thing
him
lacked
nought
that
longeth
to
a
king
as
of
the
sect
of
which
that
he
was
born
he
kept
his
law
to
which
he
was
and
he
was
hardy
wise
and
rich
besides
and
piteous
and
just
always
true
of
his
word
benign
and
honourable
his
corage
as
any
centre
stable
immovable
of
young
fresh
and
strong
in
armes
desirous
as
any
bachelor
of
all
his
house
a
fair
person
he
was
and
fortunate
and
kept
alway
so
well
his
royal
estate
that
there
was
nowhere
such
another
man
this
noble
king
this
tartar
cambuscan
hadde
two
sons
by
elfeta
his
wife
of
which
the
eldest
highte
algarsife
the
other
was
camballo
a
daughter
had
this
worthy
king
also
that
youngest
was
and
highte
canace
but
for
to
telle
you
all
her
beauty
it
lies
not
in
my
tongue
nor
my
conning
i
dare
not
undertake
so
high
a
thing
mine
english
eke
is
insufficient
it
muste
be
a
excellent
couth
his
colours
longing
for
that
art
see
if
he
should
her
describen
any
part
i
am
none
such
i
must
speak
as
i
can
and
so
befell
that
when
this
cambuscan
had
twenty
winters
borne
his
diadem
as
he
was
wont
from
year
to
year
i
deem
he
let
feast
of
his
birthday
crye
throughout
sarra
his
city
the
last
idus
of
march
after
the
year
phoebus
the
sun
full
jolly
was
and
clear
for
he
was
nigh
his
exaltation
in
marte
face
and
in
his
mansion
in
aries
the
choleric
hot
sign
full
was
the
weather
and
benign
for
which
the
fowls
against
the
sunne
sheen
what
for
the
season
and
the
younge
green
full
loude
sange
their
affections
them
seemed
to
have
got
protections
against
the
sword
of
winter
keen
and
cold
this
cambuscan
of
which
i
have
you
told
in
royal
vesture
sat
upon
his
dais
with
diadem
full
high
in
his
palace
and
held
his
feast
so
solemn
and
so
rich
that
in
this
worlde
was
there
none
it
lich
of
which
if
i
should
tell
all
the
array
then
would
it
occupy
a
summer
day
and
eke
it
needeth
not
for
to
at
every
course
the
order
of
service
i
will
not
tellen
of
their
strange
sewes
nor
of
their
swannes
nor
their
heronsews
herons
eke
in
that
land
as
telle
knightes
old
there
is
some
meat
that
is
full
dainty
hold
that
in
this
land
men
it
full
small
there
is
no
man
that
may
reporten
all
i
will
not
tarry
you
for
it
is
prime
and
for
it
is
no
fruit
but
loss
of
time
unto
my
i
will
have
recourse
and
so
befell
that
after
the
third
course
while
that
this
king
sat
thus
in
his
nobley
array
hearing
his
ministreles
their
thinges
play
before
him
at
his
board
deliciously
in
at
the
halle
door
all
suddenly
there
came
a
knight
upon
a
steed
of
brass
and
in
his
hand
a
broad
mirror
of
glass
upon
his
thumb
he
had
of
gold
a
ring
and
by
his
side
a
naked
sword
hanging
and
up
he
rode
unto
the
highe
board
in
all
the
hall
was
there
not
spoke
a
word
for
marvel
of
this
knight
him
to
behold
full
busily
they
waited
young
and
old
this
strange
knight
that
came
thus
suddenly
all
armed
save
his
head
full
richely
saluted
king
and
queen
and
lordes
all
by
order
as
they
satten
in
the
hall
with
so
high
reverence
and
observance
as
well
in
speech
as
in
his
countenance
that
gawain
with
his
olde
courtesy
though
he
were
come
again
out
of
faerie
him
not
amende
with
a
word
not
better
him
and
after
this
before
the
highe
board
by
one
he
with
a
manly
voice
said
his
message
after
the
form
used
in
his
language
withoute
of
syllable
or
letter
and
for
his
tale
shoulde
seem
the
better
accordant
to
his
worde
was
his
cheer
as
teacheth
art
of
speech
them
that
it
lear
albeit
that
i
can
not
sound
his
style
nor
can
not
climb
over
so
high
a
stile
yet
say
i
this
as
to
intent
sense
or
much
all
that
ever
he
meant
is
the
sum
if
it
so
be
that
i
have
it
in
mind
he
said
the
king
of
araby
and
ind
my
liege
lord
on
this
solemne
day
saluteth
you
as
he
best
can
and
may
and
sendeth
you
in
honour
of
your
feast
by
me
that
am
all
ready
at
your
hest
this
steed
of
brass
that
easily
and
well
can
in
the
space
of
one
day
naturel
this
is
to
say
in
hours
whereso
you
list
in
drought
or
else
in
beare
your
body
into
every
place
to
which
your
hearte
willeth
for
to
pace
go
withoute
of
you
through
foul
or
fair
injury
or
if
you
list
to
fly
as
high
in
air
as
doth
an
eagle
when
him
list
to
soar
this
same
steed
shall
bear
you
evermore
withoute
harm
till
ye
be
where
pleases
though
that
ye
sleepen
on
his
back
or
rest
and
turn
again
with
of
a
pin
he
that
it
wrought
he
many
a
gin
he
in
any
a
constellation
ere
he
had
done
this
operation
and
knew
full
many
a
seal
and
many
a
bond
this
mirror
eke
that
i
have
in
mine
hond
hath
such
a
might
that
men
may
in
it
see
when
there
shall
fall
any
adversity
unto
your
realm
or
to
yourself
also
and
openly
who
is
your
friend
or
foe
and
over
all
this
if
any
lady
bright
hath
set
her
heart
on
any
manner
wight
if
he
be
false
she
shall
his
treason
see
his
newe
love
and
all
his
subtlety
so
openly
that
there
shall
nothing
hide
wherefore
against
this
lusty
this
mirror
and
this
ring
that
ye
may
see
he
hath
sent
to
my
lady
canace
your
excellente
daughter
that
is
here
the
virtue
of
this
ring
if
ye
will
hear
is
this
that
if
her
list
it
for
to
wear
upon
her
thumb
or
in
her
purse
it
bear
there
is
no
fowl
that
flyeth
under
heaven
that
she
shall
not
well
understand
his
steven
sound
and
know
his
meaning
openly
and
plain
and
answer
him
in
his
language
again
and
every
grass
that
groweth
upon
root
she
shall
eke
know
to
whom
it
will
do
boot
all
be
his
woundes
so
deep
and
wide
this
naked
sword
that
hangeth
by
my
side
such
virtue
hath
that
what
man
that
it
smite
throughout
his
armour
it
will
carve
and
bite
were
it
as
thick
as
is
a
branched
oak
and
what
man
is
with
the
stroke
shall
be
whole
till
that
you
list
of
grace
to
stroke
him
with
the
flat
in
place
same
where
he
is
hurt
this
is
as
much
to
sayn
ye
muste
with
the
flatte
sword
again
stroke
him
upon
the
wound
and
it
will
close
this
is
the
very
sooth
withoute
glose
it
faileth
not
while
it
is
in
your
hold
and
when
this
knight
had
thus
his
tale
told
he
rode
out
of
the
hall
and
down
he
light
his
steede
which
that
shone
as
sunne
bright
stood
in
the
court
as
still
as
any
stone
the
knight
is
to
his
chamber
led
anon
and
is
unarmed
and
to
meat
these
presents
be
full
richely
this
is
to
say
the
sword
and
the
mirrour
and
borne
anon
into
the
highe
with
certain
officers
ordain
therefor
and
unto
canace
the
ring
is
bore
solemnely
where
she
sat
at
the
table
but
sickerly
withouten
any
fable
the
horse
of
brass
that
may
not
be
remued
it
stood
as
it
were
to
the
ground
there
may
no
man
out
of
the
place
it
drive
for
no
engine
of
windlass
or
polive
and
cause
why
for
they
not
the
craft
not
the
cunning
and
therefore
in
the
place
they
have
it
laft
of
the
till
that
the
knight
hath
taught
them
the
mannere
to
him
as
ye
shall
after
hear
great
was
the
press
that
swarmed
to
and
fro
to
on
this
horse
that
stoode
so
for
it
so
high
was
and
so
broad
and
long
so
well
proportioned
for
to
be
strong
right
as
it
were
a
steed
of
lombardy
therewith
so
horsely
and
so
quick
of
eye
as
it
a
gentle
poileis
courser
were
for
certes
from
his
tail
unto
his
ear
nature
nor
art
ne
could
him
not
amend
in
no
degree
as
all
the
people
wend
thought
but
evermore
their
moste
wonder
was
how
that
it
coulde
go
and
was
of
brass
it
was
of
faerie
as
the
people
seem
diverse
folk
diversely
they
deem
as
many
heads
as
many
wittes
been
they
murmured
as
doth
a
swarm
of
been
and
made
after
their
fantasies
rehearsing
of
the
olde
poetries
and
said
that
it
was
like
the
pegasee
the
horse
that
hadde
winges
for
to
flee
or
else
it
was
the
greeke
horse
sinon
that
broughte
troye
to
destruction
as
men
may
in
the
olde
read
of
adventures
mine
heart
quoth
one
is
evermore
in
dread
i
trow
some
men
of
armes
be
therein
that
them
this
city
for
to
win
prepare
it
were
right
good
that
all
such
thing
were
know
another
to
his
fellow
low
and
said
he
lies
for
it
is
rather
like
an
apparence
made
by
some
magic
as
jugglers
playen
at
these
feastes
great
of
sundry
doubts
they
jangle
thus
and
treat
as
people
deeme
commonly
of
thinges
that
be
made
more
subtilly
than
they
can
in
their
lewdness
comprehend
they
gladly
to
the
badder
end
ready
to
think
and
some
of
them
wonder
on
the
mirrour
the
that
borne
was
up
into
the
how
men
might
in
it
suche
thinges
see
another
answer
and
said
it
might
well
be
naturally
by
compositions
of
angles
and
of
sly
reflections
and
saide
that
in
rome
was
such
a
one
they
speak
of
alhazen
and
vitellon
and
aristotle
that
wrote
in
their
lives
of
mirrors
and
of
prospectives
as
knowe
they
that
have
their
bookes
heard
and
other
folk
have
wonder
on
the
swerd
that
woulde
pierce
throughout
every
thing
and
fell
in
speech
of
telephus
the
king
and
of
achilles
for
his
quainte
spear
for
he
could
with
it
bothe
heal
and
dere
right
in
such
wise
as
men
may
with
the
swerd
of
which
right
now
ye
have
yourselves
heard
they
spake
of
sundry
of
metal
and
spake
of
medicines
therewithal
and
how
and
when
it
shoulde
harden
be
which
is
unknowen
unto
me
then
spake
they
of
canacee
ring
and
saiden
all
that
such
a
wondrous
thing
of
craft
of
rings
heard
they
never
none
save
that
he
moses
and
king
solomon
hadden
name
of
in
such
art
reputation
for
thus
said
the
people
and
drew
them
apart
put
natheless
some
saide
that
it
was
wonder
to
maken
of
fern
ashes
glass
and
yet
is
glass
nought
like
ashes
of
fern
they
have
it
so
therefore
ceaseth
their
jangling
and
their
wonder
as
sore
wonder
some
on
cause
of
thunder
on
ebb
and
flood
on
gossamer
and
mist
and
on
all
things
till
that
the
cause
is
wist
thus
jangle
they
and
deemen
and
devise
till
that
the
king
gan
from
his
board
arise
phoebus
had
left
the
angle
meridional
and
yet
ascending
was
the
beast
royal
the
gentle
lion
with
his
aldrian
when
that
this
tartar
king
this
cambuscan
rose
from
the
board
there
as
he
sat
full
high
before
him
went
the
loude
minstrelsy
till
he
came
to
his
chamber
of
parements
there
as
they
sounded
diverse
instruments
that
it
was
like
a
heaven
for
to
hear
now
danced
lusty
venus
children
dear
for
in
the
their
lady
sat
full
and
looked
on
them
with
a
friendly
eye
this
noble
king
is
set
upon
his
throne
this
strange
knight
is
fetched
to
him
full
sone
and
on
the
dance
he
goes
with
canace
here
is
the
revel
and
the
jollity
that
is
not
able
a
dull
man
to
devise
he
must
have
knowen
love
and
his
service
and
been
a
man
as
fresh
as
may
gay
that
shoulde
you
devise
such
array
who
coulde
telle
you
the
form
of
dances
so
uncouth
and
so
freshe
such
subtle
lookings
and
dissimulances
for
dread
of
jealous
men
apperceivings
no
man
but
launcelot
and
he
is
dead
therefore
i
pass
all
this
i
say
no
more
but
in
this
jolliness
i
leave
them
till
to
supper
men
them
dress
the
steward
bids
the

the

dainties
more

went
this
noble

to
see
the

of
brass
with
all
a
rout
of
lordes
and
of

him
about
such
was
there
on

horse
of
brass
that
since
the
great
siege
of
troye
was
there
as
men
wonder
on
a
horse
also
was
there
such
a
as
was
tho
but
finally
the
king
asked
the
knight
the
virtue
of
this
courser
and
the
might
and
prayed
him
to
tell
his
governance
of
managing
him
the
horse
anon
began
to
trip
and
dance
when
that
the
knight
laid
hand
upon
his
rein
and
saide

the
contrary
swore

of
fumosity
that
caused
dreams
which
there
is
no

no
they
slepte
till
that
it
was
large
the
moste
part
it
was
canace
she
was
full
measurable
as
women
be
for
of
her
father
had
she
her
leave
to
go
to
rest
soon
after
it
was
eve
her
liste
not
for
to
be
look
pale
nor
on
the
morrow
for
to
see
look
sad
and
slept
her
firste
sleep
and
then
awoke
for
such
a
joy
she
in
her
hearte
took
both
of
her
quainte
a
ring
and
her
mirrour
that
twenty
times
she
changed
her
colour
and
in
her
sleep
right
for
th
impression
of
her
mirror
she
had
a
vision
wherefore
ere
that
the
sunne
gan
up
glide
she
call
upon
her
her
beside
and
saide
that
her
liste
for
to
rise
these
olde
women
that
be
gladly
wise
as
are
her
mistresses
answer
anon
and
said
madame
whither
will
ye
gon
thus
early
for
the
folk
be
all
in
rest
i
will
quoth
she
arise
for
me
lest
no
longer
for
to
sleep
and
walk
about
her
mistresses
call
women
a
great
rout
and
up
they
rose
well
a
ten
or
twelve
up
rose
freshe
canace
herselve
as
ruddy
and
bright
as
is
the
yonnge
sun
that
in
the
ram
is
four
degrees
no
higher
was
he
when
she
ready
was
and
forth
she
walked
easily
a
pace
array
after
the
season
swoot
lightely
for
to
play
and
walk
on
foot
nought
but
with
five
or
six
of
her
meinie
and
in
a
forth
in
the
park
went
she
path
the
vapour
which
up
from
the
earthe
glode
made
the
sun
to
seem
ruddy
and
broad
but
natheless
it
was
so
fair
a
sight
that
it
made
all
their
heartes
for
to
light
lightened
glad
what
for
the
season
and
the
morrowning
and
for
the
fowles
that
she
hearde
sing
for
right
anon
she
what
they
meant
right
by
their
song
and
knew
all
their
intent
the
knotte
why
that
every
tale
is
told
chief
matter
if
it
be
till
the
be
cold
of
them
that
have
it
hearken
yore
a
long
the
savour
passeth
ever
longer
more
for
fulsomness
of
the
prolixity
and
by
that
same
reason
thinketh
me
i
shoulde
unto
the
knotte
condescend
and
maken
of
her
walking
soon
an
end
amid
a
tree
as
white
as
chalk
dried
up
there
sat
a
falcon
her
head
full
high
that
with
a
piteous
voice
so
gan
to
cry
that
all
the
wood
resounded
of
her
cry
and
beat
she
had
herself
so
piteously
with
both
her
winges
till
the
redde
blood
ran
the
tree
there
as
she
stood
top
to
bottom
and
alway
she
cried
and
shright
and
with
her
beak
herselfe
she
so
pight
that
there
is
no
tiger
nor
cruel
beast
that
dwelleth
either
in
wood
or
in
forest
but
would
have
wept
if
that
he
weepe
could
for
sorrow
of
her
she
shriek
alway
so
loud
for
there
was
never
yet
no
man
alive
if
that
he
could
a
falcon
well
descrive
that
heard
of
such
another
of
fairness
as
well
of
plumage
as
of
gentleness
of
shape
of
all
that
mighte
reckon
be
a
falcon
peregrine
seemed
she
of
land
and
ever
as
she
stood
she
swooned
now
and
now
for
lack
of
blood
till
is
she
fallen
from
the
tree
this
faire
kinge
daughter
canace
that
on
her
finger
bare
the
quainte
ring
through
which
she
understood
well
every
thing
that
any
fowl
may
in
his
sayn
and
could
him
answer
in
his
leden
again
hath
understoode
what
this
falcon
said
and
for
the
almost
she
died
and
to
the
tree
she
went
full
hastily
and
on
this
falcon
looked
piteously
and
held
her
lap
abroad
for
well
she
wist
the
falcon
muste
falle
from
the
bough
when
that
she
swooned
next
for
lack
of
blood
a
longe
while
to
waite
her
she
stood
till
at
the
last
she
apake
in
this
mannere
unto
the
hawk
as
ye
shall
after
hear
what
is
the
cause
if
it
be
for
to
tell
that
ye
be
in
this
pain
of
hell
furious
quoth
canace
unto
this
hawk
above
is
this
for
sorrow
of
of
death
or
loss
of
love
for
as
i
trow
these
be
the
causes
two
that
cause
most
a
gentle
hearte
woe
of
other
harm
it
needeth
not
to
speak
for
ye
yourself
upon
yourself
awreak
which
proveth
well
that
either
ire
or
must
be
occasion
of
your
cruel
deed
since
that
i
see
none
other
wight
you
chase
for
love
of
god
as
yourselfe
grace
mercy
on
or
what
may
be
your
help
for
west
nor
east
i
never
saw
ere
now
no
bird
nor
beast
that
fared
with
himself
so
piteously
ye
slay
me
with
your
sorrow
verily
i
have
of
you
so
great
compassioun
for
godde
love
come
from
the
tree
adown
and
as
i
am
a
kinge
daughter
true
if
that
i
verily
the
causes
knew
of
your
disease
if
it
lay
in
my
might
i
would
amend
it
ere
that
it
were
night
so
wisly
help
me
the
great
god
of
kind
and
herbes
shall
i
right
enoughe
find
to
heale
with
your
hurtes
hastily
then
shriek
this
falcon
yet
more
piteously
than
ever
she
did
and
fell
to
ground
anon
and
lay
aswoon
as
dead
as
lies
a
stone
till
canace
had
in
her
lap
her
take
unto
that
time
she
gan
of
swoon
awake
and
after
that
she
out
of
swoon
abraid
right
in
her
hawke
leden
thus
she
said
that
pity
runneth
soon
in
gentle
heart
feeling
his
in
paines
smart
is
proved
every
day
as
men
may
see
as
well
work
as
by
authority
experience
as
by
for
gentle
hearte
gentleness
i
see
well
that
ye
have
on
my
distress
compassion
my
faire
canace
of
very
womanly
benignity
that
nature
in
your
princples
hath
set
but
for
no
hope
for
to
fare
the
bet
but
for
t
obey
unto
your
hearte
free
and
for
to
make
others
aware
by
me
as
by
the
whelp
is
the
lion
corrected
right
for
that
cause
and
that
conclusion
while
that
i
have
a
leisure
and
a
space
mine
harm
i
will
confessen
ere
i
pace
and
ever
while
the
one
her
sorrow
told
the
other
wept
she
to
water
if
she
would
dissolve
till
that
the
falcon
bade
her
to
be
still
into
and
with
a
sigh
right
thus
she
said
till
where
i
was
bred
alas
that
day
and
foster
in
a
rock
of
marble
gray
so
tenderly
that
nothing
ailed
me
i
not
what
was
adversity
till
i
could
full
high
under
the
sky
then
dwell
a
tercelet
me
faste
by
that
seem
a
well
of
alle
gentleness
were
full
of
treason
and
falseness
he
it
was
so
wrapped
humble
cheer
an
aspect
and
under
hue
of
truth
in
such
mannere
of
under
pleasance
and
under
busy
pain
that
no
wight
weened
that
he
coulde
feign
so
deep
in
grain
he
dyed
his
colours
right
as
a
serpent
hides
him
under
till
he
may
see
his
time
for
to
bite
right
so
this
god
of
love
hypocrite
did
so
his
ceremonies
and
obeisances
and
kept
in
semblance
all
his
observances
that
gentleness
of
love
consonant
as
on
a
tomb
is
all
the
fair
above
and
under
is
the
corpse
which
that
ye
wet
such
was
this
hypocrite
both
cold
and
hot
and
in
this
wise
he
served
his
intent
that
save
the
fiend
none
wiste
what
he
meant
till
he
so
long
had
weeped
and
complain
and
many
a
year
his
service
to
me
feign
till
that
mine
heart
too
piteous
and
too
nice
simple
all
innocent
of
his
crowned
malice
of
his
death
as
thoughte
me
afraid
lest
upon
his
oathes
and
his
surety
he
should
granted
him
love
on
this
conditioun
that
evermore
mine
honour
and
renown
were
saved
bothe
and
apert
and
in
this
is
to
say
that
after
his
desert
i
gave
him
all
my
heart
and
all
my
thought
god
wot
and
he
that
wayes
no
other
and
took
his
heart
in
change
of
mine
for
aye
but
sooth
is
said
gone
since
many
a
day
a
true
wight
and
a
thiefe
not
one
not
think
and
when
he
saw
the
thing
so
far
that
i
had
granted
him
fully
my
love
in
such
a
wise
as
i
have
said
above
and
given
him
my
true
heart
as
free
as
he
swore
that
he
gave
his
heart
to
me
anon
this
tiger
full
of
doubleness
fell
on
his
knees
with
so
great
humbleness
with
so
high
reverence
as
by
his
cheer
so
like
a
gentle
lover
in
mannere
so
ravish
as
it
seemed
for
the
joy
that
never
jason
nor
paris
of
troy
jason
certes
nor
ever
other
man
since
lamech
was
that
began
of
all
to
love
two
as
write
folk
beforn
nor
ever
since
the
firste
man
was
born
coulde
no
man
by
twenty
thousand
counterfeit
the
of
his
art
beguilements
where
doubleness
of
feigning
should
approach
nor
worthy
were
his
galoche
nor
could
so
thank
a
wight
as
he
did
me
his
manner
was
a
heaven
for
to
see
to
any
woman
were
she
so
wise
so
painted
he
and
kempt
point
devise
studied
as
well
his
wordes
as
his
countenance
perfect
and
i
so
lov
him
for
his
obeisance
and
for
the
truth
i
deemed
in
his
heart
that
if
so
were
that
any
thing
him
smart
all
were
it
so
lite
and
i
it
wist
methought
i
felt
death
at
my
hearte
twist
and
shortly
so
farforth
this
thing
is
went
that
my
will
was
his
wille
instrument
that
is
to
say
my
will
obey
his
will
in
alle
thing
as
far
as
reason
fill
allowed
keeping
the
boundes
of
my
worship
ever
and
never
had
i
thing
lefe
or
lever
dear
or
as
him
god
wot
nor
never
shall
no
mo
this
lasted
longer
than
a
year
or
two
that
i
supposed
of
him
naught
but
good
but
finally
thus
at
the
last
it
stood
that
fortune
woulde
that
he
muste
separate
out
of
that
place
which
that
i
was
in
me
was
woe
it
is
no
question
i
can
not
make
of
it
description
for
one
thing
dare
i
telle
boldely
i
know
what
is
the
pain
of
death
thereby
such
harm
i
felt
for
he
might
not
byleve
so
on
a
day
of
me
he
took
his
leave
so
sorrowful
eke
that
i
ween
verily
that
he
had
felt
as
muche
harm
as
i
when
that
i
heard
him
speak
and
saw
his
hue
but
natheless
i
thought
he
was
so
true
and
eke
that
he
repaire
should
again
within
a
little
while
sooth
to
sayn
and
reason
would
eke
that
he
muste
go
for
his
honour
as
often
so
that
i
made
virtue
of
necessity
and
took
it
well
since
that
it
muste
be
as
i
best
might
i
hid
from
him
my
sorrow
and
took
him
by
the
hand
saint
john
to
borrow
pledge
and
said
him
thus
i
am
youres
all
be
such
as
i
have
been
to
you
and
shall
what
he
answer
it
needs
not
to
rehearse
who
can
say
than
he
who
can
do
worse
when
he
had
all
well
said
then
had
he
done
therefore
behoveth
him
a
full
long
spoon
that
shall
eat
with
a
fiend
thus
heard
i
say
so
at
the
last
he
muste
forth
his
way
and
forth
he
flew
till
he
came
where
him
lest
when
it
came
him
to
purpose
for
to
rest
i
trow
that
he
had
thilke
text
in
mind
that
alle
thing
repairing
to
his
kind
gladdeth
himself
thus
say
men
as
i
guess
love
of
proper
kind
newfangleness
note
as
birdes
do
that
men
in
cages
feed
for
though
thou
night
and
day
take
of
them
heed
and
strew
their
cage
fair
and
soft
as
silk
and
give
them
sugar
honey
bread
and
milk
yet
anon
as
that
his
door
is
up
on
his
he
with
his
feet
will
spurne
down
his
cup
door
being
and
to
the
wood
he
will
and
wormes
eat
so
newefangle
be
they
of
their
meat
and
love
novelties
of
proper
kind
no
gentleness
of
bloode
may
them
bind
so
far
this
tercelet
alas
the
day
though
he
were
gentle
born
and
fresh
and
gay
and
goodly
for
to
see
and
humble
and
free
he
saw
upon
a
time
a
kite
flee
and
suddenly
he
loved
this
kite
so
that
all
his
love
is
clean
from
me
and
hath
his
trothe
falsed
in
this
wise
thus
hath
the
kite
my
love
in
her
service
and
i
am
withoute
remedy
undone
and
with
that
word
this
falcon
gan
to
cry
and
swooned
in
canacee
great
was
the
sorrow
for
that
hawke
harm
that
canace
and
all
her
women
made
they
wist
not
how
they
might
the
falcon
glade
but
canace
home
bare
her
in
her
lap
and
softely
in
plasters
gan
her
wrap
there
as
she
with
her
beak
had
hurt
herselve
now
can
not
canace
but
herbes
delve
out
of
the
ground
and
make
salves
new
of
herbes
precious
and
fine
of
hue
to
heale
with
this
hawk
from
day
to
night
she
did
her
business
and
all
her
might
and
by
her
bedde
head
she
made
a
mew
cage
and
cover
it
with
blue
in
sign
of
truth
that
is
in
woman
seen
and
all
without
the
mew
is
painted
green
in
which
were
painted
all
these
false
fowls
as
be
these
tidifes
tercelets
and
owls
and
pies
on
them
for
to
cry
and
chide
right
for
despite
were
painted
them
beside
thus
leave
i
canace
her
hawk
keeping
i
will
no
more
as
now
speak
of
her
ring
till
it
come
to
purpose
for
to
sayn
how
that
this
falcon
got
her
love
again
repentant
as
the
story
telleth
us
by
mediation
of
camballus
the
kinge
son
of
which
that
i
you
told
but
henceforth
i
will
my
process
hold
to
speak
of
aventures
and
of
battailes
that
yet
was
never
heard
so
great
marvailles
first
i
will
telle
you
of
cambuscan
that
in
his
time
many
a
city
wan
and
after
will
i
speak
of
algarsife
how
he
won
theodora
to
his
wife
for
whom
full
oft
in
great
peril
he
was
been
holpen
by
the
horse
of
brass
he
and
after
will
i
speak
of
camballo
that
fought
in
listes
with
the
brethren
two
for
canace
ere
that
he
might
her
win
and
where
i
left
i
will
again
begin
notes
to
the
squire
tale
the
squire
tale
has
not
been
found
under
any
other
form
among
the
literary
remains
of
the
middle
ages
and
it
is
unknown
from
what
original
it
was
derived
if
from
any
the
tale
is
unfinished
not
because
the
conclusion
has
been
lost
but
because
the
author
left
it
so
the
russians
and
tartars
waged
constant
hostilities
between
the
thirteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
in
the
best
manuscripts
the
name
is
cambynskan
and
thus
no
doubt
it
should
strictly
be
read
but
it
is
a
most
pardonable
offence
against
literal
accuracy
to
use
the
word
which
milton
has
made
classical
in
il
penseroso
speaking
of
him
that
left
the
story
of
cambuscan
bold
of
camball
and
of
algarsife
and
who
had
canace
to
wife
that
owned
the
virtuous
ring
and
glass
and
of
the
wondrous
horse
of
brass
on
which
the
tartar
king
did
ride
surely
the
admiration
of
milton
might
well
seem
to
the
spirit
of
chaucer
to
condone
a
much
greater
transgression
on
his
domain
than
this
verbal
change
which
to
both
eye
and
ear
is
an
unquestionable
improvement
on
the
uncouth

the
precise
force
of
the
word
is
uncertain
but
it
may
be
connected
with

it

tyrwhitt
would
connect
the
two
words

taking
both
from

which
is
not

probable
we
must
agree
with
tyrwhitt
that
there
is
a
mistake
here
which
no

chaucer
would
have
rectified
if
the

though

that
may
be
due

is

in

ye

to

was
abundantly
justified
by
the
internal
evidence
afforded
by
the
lines
themselves
in
transferring
them
to
their
present
place
the
breton
lays
were
an
important
and
curious
element
in
the
literature
of
the
middle
ages
they
were
originally
composed
in
the
armorican
language
and
the
chief
collection
of
them
extant
was
translated
into
french
verse
by
a
poetess
calling
herself
marie
about
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
but
though
this
collection
was
the
most
famous
and
had
doubtless
been
read
by
chaucer
there
were
other
british
or
breton
lays
and
from
one
of
those
the
franklin
tale
is
taken
boccaccio
has
dealt
with
the
same
story
in
the
decameron
and
the

altering
the
circumstances
to
suit
the
removal
of
its
scene
to

clime
the
tale
in

that
called

there
was
a
knight

lov

his
himself
to
serve
a
lady
in
his
beste
wise
and
many
a
labour
many
a
great
emprise
he
for
his
lady
wrought
ere
she
were
won
for
she
was
one
the
fairest
under
sun
and
eke
thereto
come
of
so
high
kindred
that
unnethes
durst
this
knight
for
dread
note
tell
her
his
woe
his
pain
and
his
distress
but
at
the
last
she
for
his
worthiness
and
for
his
meek
obeisance
hath
such
a
pity
caught
of
his
penance
distress
that
privily
she
fell
of
his
accord
to
take
him
for
her
husband
and
her
lord
of
such
lordship
as
men
have
their
wives
and
for
to
lead
the
more
in
bliss
their
lives
of
his
free
will
he
swore
her
as
a
knight
that
never
in
all
his
life
he
day
nor
night
should
take
upon
himself
no
mastery
against
her
will
nor
her
jealousy
but
her
obey
and
follow
her
will
in
all
as
any
lover
to
his
lady
shall
save
that
the
name
of
sovereignety
that
would
he
have
for
shame
of
his
degree
she
thanked
him
and
with
full
great
humbless
she
saide

since
of
your

ye
proffer
me
to
have
so

not

so
do

mourneth
waketh

fasteth
plaineth
desire
of

so
distraineth
that
all

which
that
knew

heavy
thought
comforte
her
in
all
that
ever
they
may
they
preache
her
they
tell
her
night
and
day
that
causeless
she
slays
herself
alas
and
every
comfort
possible
in
this
case
they
do
to
her
with
all
their
business
and
all
to
make
her
leave
her
heaviness
by
process
as
ye
knowen
every
one
men
may
so
longe
graven
in
a
stone
till
some
figure
therein
imprinted
be
so
long
have
they
comforted
her
till
she
received
hath
by
hope
and
by
reason
th
imprinting
of
their
consolation
through
which
her
greate
sorrow
gan
assuage
she
may
not
always
duren
in
such
rage
and
eke
arviragus
in
all
this
care
hath
sent
his
letters
home
of
his
welfare
and
that
he
will
come
hastily
again
or
elles
had
this
sorrow
her
her
friendes
saw
her
sorrow
gin
to
slake
diminish
and
prayed
her
on
knees
for
godde
sake
to
come
and
roamen
in
their
company
away
to
drive
her
darke
fantasy
and
finally
she
granted
that
request
for
well
she
saw
that
it
was
for
the
best
now
stood
her
castle
faste
by
the
sea
and
often
with
her
friendes
walked
she
her
to
disport
upon
the
bank
on
high
there
as
many
a
ship
and
barge
sigh
sailing
their
courses
where
them
list
to
go
but
then
was
that
a
of
her
woe
for
to
herself
full
oft
alas
said
she
is
there
no
ship
of
so
many
as
i
see
will
bringe
home
my
lord
then
were
my
heart
all
of
this
bitter
paine
smart
another
time
would
she
sit
and
think
and
cast
her
eyen
downward
from
the
brink
but
when
she
saw
the
grisly
rockes
blake
for
very
fear
so
would
her
hearte
quake
that
on
her
feet
she
might
her
not
then
would
she
sit
adown
upon
the
green
and
piteously
the
sea
behold
out
on
the
and
say
right
thus
with
cold
eternal
god
that
through
thy
purveyance
leadest
this
world
by
certain
governance
idle
as
men
say
ye
nothing
make
in
but
lord
these
grisly
fiendly
rockes
blake
that
seem
rather
a
foul
confusion
of
work
than
any
fair
creation
of
such
a
perfect
wise
god
and
stable
why
have
ye
wrought
this
work
unreasonable
for
by
this
work
north
south
or
west
or
east
there
is
not
foster
man
nor
bird
nor
beast
it
doth
no
good
to
my
wit
but
see
ye
not
lord
how
mankind
it
destroyeth
a
hundred
thousand
bodies
of
mankind
have
rockes
slain
be
they
not
in
mind
they
are
which
mankind
is
so
fair
part
of
thy
work
thou
madest
it
like
to
thine
owen
mark
then
seemed
it
ye
had
a
great
affection
toward
mankind
but
how
then
may
it
be
that
ye
such
meanes
make
it
to
destroy
which
meanes
do
no
good
but
ever
annoy
i
wot
well
clerkes
will
say
as
them
lest
by
arguments
that
all
is
for
the
best
although
i
can
the
causes
not
but
god
that
made
the
wind
to
blow
as
keep
my
lord
this
is
my
conclusion
to
clerks
leave
i
all
disputation
but
would
to
god
that
all
these
rockes
blake
were
sunken
into
helle
for
his
sake
these
rockes
slay
mine
hearte
for
the
fear
thus
would
she
say
with
many
a
piteous
tear
her
friendes
saw
that
it
was
no
disport
to
roame
by
the
sea
but
discomfort
and
them
for
to
playe
somewhere
else
they
leade
her
by
rivers
and
by
wells
and
eke
in
other
places
delectables
they
dancen
and
they
play
at
chess
and
tables
so
on
a
day
right
in
the
unto
a
garden
that
was
there
beside
in
which
that
they
had
made
their
arrangement
of
victual
and
of
other
purveyance
they
go
and
play
them
all
the
longe
day
and
this
was
on
the
sixth
morrow
of
may
which
may
had
painted
with
his
softe
showers
this
garden
full
of
leaves
and
of
flowers
and
craft
of
manne
hand
so
curiously
arrayed
had
this
garden
truely
that
never
was
there
garden
of
such
price
praise
it
were
the
very
paradise
of
flowers
and
the
freshe
sight
would
have
maked
any
hearte
light
that
was
born
too
great
sickness
or
too
great
sorrow
held
it
in
distress
so
full
it
was
of
beauty
and
pleasance
and
after
dinner
they
began
to
dance
and
sing
also
save
dorigen
alone
who
made
alway
her
complaint
and
her
moan
for
she
saw
not
him
on
the
dance
go
that
was
her
husband
and
her
love
also
but
natheless
she
must
a
time
abide
and
with
good
hope
let
her
sorrow
slide
upon
this
dance
amonge
other
men
danced
a
squier
before
dorigen
that
fresher
was
and
jollier
of
array
to
my
doom
than
is
the
month
of
may
my
he
sang
and
danced
passing
any
man
that
is
or
was
since
that
the
world
began
therewith
he
was
if
men
should
him
descrive
one
of
the
men
alive
young
strong
and
virtuous
and
rich
and
wise
and
well
beloved
and
holden
in
great
price
value
and
shortly
if
the
sooth
i
telle
shall
this
dorigen
at
all
this
lusty
squier
servant
to
venus
which
that
was
aurelius
had
lov
her
best
of
any
creature
two
year
and
more
as

but
never
durst
he
tell

his
grievance
withoute
cup
he
drank
all
his
penance
he
was
despaired
nothing
durst
he
say
save
in
his
songes
somewhat
would
he
his
woe
as
in
a
general
complaining
he
said
he
lov
and
was
belov
nothing
of
suche
matter
made
he
many
lays
songes
complaintes
roundels
virelays
how
that
he
durste
not
his
sorrow
tell
but
languished
as
doth
a
fury
in
hell
and
die
he
must
he
said
as
did
echo
for
narcissus
that
durst
not
tell
her
woe
in
other
manner
than
ye
hear
me
say
he
durste
not
to

his
woe
bewray
save
that
paraventure
sometimes
at
dances
where
younge
folke
keep
their
observances
it
may
well
be
he
looked
on
her
face
in
such
a
wise
as

that
asketh

of
his

fell
in

and
more

other
friends
many
a

and
in
the
alleys
roamed
up
and
down
and
nothing
wist
of

conclusion
but
suddenly
began
to
revel
new
till
that
the
brighte
sun
had
lost
his
hue
for
th
horizon
had
reft
the
sun
his
light

and
in

with
sorrowful

that

felt
his
hearte
cold
up
to
the
his
handes
gan

hold
and
on
his
knees
bare
he
set
him
down
and
in
his
raving
said
his
orisoun
for
very
woe
out
of
his
wit
he
braid
he
wist
not
what
he
spake
but
thus
he
said
with
piteous
heart
his
plaint
hath

the
gods
and
first
unto
the

said

down
and

forth
in
a
trance

penance
up
caught

thine
arms

freshe
knight
the
worthy
man
of
arms
that
loveth
thee
as
his
own
hearte
life
list
him
to
be
cared
not
to
if
any
wight
had
spoke
while
he
was
out
to
her
of
love
he
had
of
that
no
doubt
suspicion
he
not
to
no
such
mattere
himself
with
but
danced
jousted
and
made
merry
cheer
and
thus
in
joy
and
bliss
i
let
them
dwell
and
of
the
sick
aurelius
will
i
tell
in
languor
and
in
torment
furious
two
year
and
more
lay
wretch
aurelius
ere
any
foot
on
earth
he
mighte
gon
nor
comfort
in
this
time
had
he
none
save
of
his
brother
which
that
was
a
clerk
he
knew
of
all
this
woe
and
all
this
work
for
to
none
other
creature
certain
of
this
matter
he
durst
no
worde
sayn
under
his
breast
he
bare
it
more
secree
than
did
pamphilus
for
his
breast
was
whole
withoute
for
to
seen
but
in
his
heart
aye
was
the
arrow
keen
and
well
ye
know
that
of
a
sursanure
in
surgery
is
perilous
the
cure
men
might
touch
the
arrow
or
come
thereby
his
brother
wept
and
wailed
privily
till
at
the
last
him
fell
in
remembrance
that
while
he
was
at
orleans
in
france
as
younge
clerkes
that
be
to
readen
artes
that
be
curious
seeken
in
every
and
every
and
particular
sciences
for
to
learn
he
him
remember
that
upon
a
day
at
orleans
in
study
a
book
he
of
magic
natural
which
his
fellaw
that
was
that
time
a
bachelor
of
law
were
he
there
to
learn
another
craft
had
privily
upon
his
desk
which
book
spake
much
of
operations
touching
the
eight
mansions
that
longe
to
the
moon
and
such
folly
as
in
our
dayes
is
not
worth
a
fly
for
holy
church
faith
in
our
believe
creed
us
none
illusion
to
grieve
and
when
this
book
was
in
his
remembrance
anon
for
joy
his
heart
began
to
dance
and
to
himself
he
saide
privily
my
brother
shall
be
hastily
for
i
am
that
there
be
sciences
by
which
men
make
divers
apparences
such
as
these
subtle
tregetoures
play
for
oft
at
feaste
have
i
well
heard
say
that
tregetours
within
a
halle
large
have
made
come
in
a
water
and
a

and
in
the
halle
rowen
up
and
down
sometimes
hath
seemed
come
a
grim
lioun
and
sometimes
flowers
spring
as
in
a
mead
sometimes
a
vine
and
grapes
white
and
red
sometimes
a
castle
all
of
lime
and
stone
and
when
them
liked
it
anon
thus
seemed
it
to
every

now
then
conclude
i
thus
if

at

some

he
gave
him
for

that

and
on

as
there
was
one
aurelius

went
to
suppere
forestes
parkes
full
of

he
saw
of

an
hundred
slain
with

saw
when

pleasance
that
he
him
shew
his
lady
on
a
dance
in
which
himselfe
danced
as

and
when

saw
it
was
time
he
clapp
his
handes
two
and
farewell
all
the
revel
is
removed
and
yet
remov
they
never
out
of

satte
still
and
no

quoth
he
as
for

these
amorous
folk
some
time
must
have
rest
at
after

fell
they
in
treaty
what
summe
should
this
master
be
to
remove
all
the
rockes
of
bretagne
and
eke
from
gironde
to
the
mouth
of
seine
he
made
it
strange
and
swore
so
god
him
save
matter
of
less
than
a
thousand
pound
he
would
not
have
gladly
for
that
sum
he
would
not
gon
note
aurelius
with
blissful
heart
anon
answered
thus
fie
on
a
thousand
pound
this
wide
world
which
that
men
say
is
round
i
would
it
give
if
i
were
lord
of
it
this
bargain
is
for
we
be
knit
ye
shall
be
payed
truly
by
my
troth
but
looke
for
no
negligence
or
sloth
ye
tarry
us
here
no
longer
than
nay
quoth
the
clerk
have
here
my
faith
to
borrow
pledge
my
to
bed
is
gone
aurelius
when
him
lest
faith
on
and
all
that
night
he
had
his
rest
what
for
his
labour
and
his
hope
of
bliss
his
woeful
heart
penance
had
a
liss
a
respite
from
upon
the
morrow
when
that
it
was
day
unto
bretagne
they
took
the
righte
way
aurelius
and
this
magician
beside
and
be
descended
where
they
would
abide
and
this
was
as
the
bookes
me
remember
the
colde
frosty
season
of
december
phoebus
wax
old
and
hued
like
latoun
that
in
his
hote
declinatioun
shone
as
the
burned
gold
with
bright
but
now
in
capricorn
adown
he
light
where
as
he
shone
full
pale
i
dare
well
sayn
the
bitter
frostes
with
the
sleet
and
rain
destroyed
have
the
green
in
every
yard
garden
janus
sits
by
the
fire
with
double
beard
and
drinketh
of
his
bugle
horn
the
wine
before
him
stands
the
brawn
of
tusked
swine
and
nowel
crieth
every
lusty
man
aurelius
in
all
that
he
can
did
to
his
master
cheer
and
reverence
and
prayed
him
to
do
his
diligence
to
bringe
him
out
of
his
paines
smart
or
with
a
sword
that
he
would
slit
his
heart
this
subtle
clerk
such
had
on
this
man
that
night
and
day
he
sped
him
that
he
can
to
wait
a
time
of
his
conclusion
this
is
to
say
to
make
illusion
by
such
an
appearance
of
jugglery
i
know
no
termes
of
astrology
that
she
and
every
wight
should
ween
and
say
that
of
bretagne
the
rockes
were
away
or
else
they
were
sunken
under
ground
so
at
the
last
he
hath
a
time
found
to
make
his
and
his
wretchedness
of
such
a
cursedness
his
tables
toletanes
forth
he
brought
full
well
corrected
that
there
lacked
nought
neither
his
collect
nor
his
expanse
years
neither
his
rootes
nor
his
other
gears
as
be
his
centres
and
his
arguments
and
his
proportional
convenients
for
his
equations
in
everything
and
by
his
eighte
spheres
in
his
working
he
knew
full
well
how
far
alnath
was
shove
from
the
head
of
that
fix
aries
above
that
in
the
ninthe
sphere
consider
is
full
subtilly
he
calcul
all
this
when
he
had
found
his
firste
mansion
he
knew
the
remnant
by
proportion
and
knew
the
rising
of
his
moone
well
and
in
whose
face
and
term
and
every
deal
and
knew
full
well
the
moone
mansion
accordant
to
his
operation
and
knew
also
his
other
observances
for
such
illusions
and
such
meschances
devices
as
heathen
folk
used
in
thilke
days
for
which
no
longer
made
he
delays
but
through
his
magic
for
a
day
or
tway
it
seemed
all
the
rockes
were
away
aurelius
which
yet
despaired
is
he
shall
have
his
love
or
fare
amiss
awaited
night
and
day
on
this
miracle
and
when
he
knew
that
there
was
none
obstacle
that
were
these
rockes
every
one
down
at
his
master
feet
he
fell
anon
and
said
i
woeful
wretch
aurelius
thank
you
my
lord
and
lady
mine
venus
that
me
have
holpen
from
my
cares
cold
and
to
the
temple
his
way
forth
hath
he
hold
where
as
he
knew
he
should
his
lady
see
and
when
he
saw
his
time
anon
right
he
with
heart
and
with
full
humble
saluteth
hath
his
sovereign
lady

and
she

stood
in
all
her
face
was
not
one
drop
of
blood
she
never
ween
come
in
such
a
trap
alas
quoth
she
that
ever
this
should
hap
for
ween
i
by
possibility
that
such
a
monster
or
marvail
might
be
it
is
against
the
process
of
nature
and
home
she
went
a
sorrowful
creature
for
very
fear
may
she
go
she
weeped
wailed
all
a
day
or
two
and
swooned
that
it
ruthe
was
to
see
but
why
it
was
to
no
wight
tolde
she
for
out
of
town
was
gone
arviragus
but
to
herself
she
spake
and
saide
thus
with
face
pale
and
full
sorrowful
cheer
in
her
complaint
as
ye
shall
after
hear
alas
quoth
she
on
thee
fortune
i
plain
that
unware
hast
me
wrapped
in
thy
chain
from
which
to
scape
wot
i
no
succour
save
only
death
or
elles
dishonour
one
of
these
two
behoveth
me
to
choose
but
natheless
yet
had
i
lose
rather
my
life
than
of
my
body
have
shame
or
know
myselfe
false
or
lose
my
name
and
with
my
death
may
be
quit
may
certainly
purchase
hath
there
not
many
a
noble
wife
ere
this
my
and
many
a
maiden
slain
herself
alas
rather
than
with
her
body
do
trespass
yes
certes
lo
these
stories
bear
witness
when
thirty
tyrants
full
of
had
slain
phidon
in
athens
at
the
feast
they
commanded
his
daughters
to
arrest
and
bringe
them
before
them
in
despite
all
naked
to
fulfil
their
foul
delight
and
in
their
father
blood
they
made
them
dance
upon
the
pavement
god
give
them
mischance
for
which
these
woeful
maidens
full
of
dread
rather
than
they
would
lose
their
maidenhead
they
privily
into
a
well
leaped
and
drowned
themselves
as
the
bookes
tell
they
of
messene
let
inquire
and
seek
of
lacedaemon
fifty
maidens
eke
on
which
they
woulde
do
their
lechery
but
there
was
none
of
all
that
company
that
was
not
slain
and
with
a
glad
intent
chose
rather
for
to
die
than
to
assent
to
be
of
her
maidenhead
bereft
why
should
i
then
to
dien
be
in
dread
lo
eke
the
tyrant
aristoclides
that
lov
a
maiden
hight
stimphalides
when
that
her
father
slain
was
on
a
night
unto
diana
temple
went
she
right
and
the
image
in
her
handes
two
clasped
from
which
image
she
woulde
never
go
no
wight
her
handes
might
off
it
arace
away
by
force
till
she
was
slain
right
in
the
place
now
since
that
maidens
hadde
such
despite
to
be
defouled
with
man
foul
delight
well
ought
a
wife
rather
herself
to
sle
than
be
defouled
as
it
thinketh
me
what
shall
i
say
of
hasdrubale
wife
that
at
carthage
bereft
herself
of
life
for
when
she
saw
the
romans
win
the
town
she
took
her
children
all
and
skipt
adown
into
the
fire
and
rather
chose
to
die
than
any
roman
did
her
villainy
hath
not
lucretia
slain
herself
alas
at
rome
when
that
she
was
of
tarquin
for
her
thought
it
was
a
shame
to
live
when
she
hadde
lost
her
name
the
seven
maidens
of
milesie
also
have
slain
themselves
for
very
dread
and
woe
rather
than
folk
of
gaul
them
should
oppress
more
than
a
thousand
stories
as
i
guess
could
i
now
tell
as
touching
this
mattere
when
abradate
was
slain
his
wife
so
dear
herselfe
slew
and
let
her
blood
to
glide
in
abradate
woundes
deep
and
wide
and
said
body
at
the
leaste
way
there
shall
no
wight
defoul
if
that
i
may
why
should
i
more
examples
hereof
sayn
since
that
so
many
have
themselves
slain
well
rather
than
they
would
defouled
be
i
will
conclude
that
it
is
for
me
to
slay
myself
than
be
defouled
thus
i
will
be
true
unto
arviragus
or
elles
slay
myself
in
some
mannere
as
did
demotione
daughter
dear
because
she
woulde
not
defouled
be
o
sedasus
it
is
full
great
pity
to
reade
how
thy
daughters
died
alas
that
slew
themselves
suche
manner
cas
circumstances
of
as
great
a
pity
was
it
or
well
more
the
same
the
theban
maiden
that
for
nicanor
herselfe
slew
right
for
such
manner
woe
another
theban
maiden
did
right
so
for
one
of
macedon
had
her
oppress
she
with
her
death
her
maidenhead
redress
what
shall
i
say
of
niceratus
wife
that
for
such
case
bereft
herself
her
life
how
true
was
eke
to
alcibiades
his
love
that
for
to
dien
rather
chese
than
for
to
suffer
his
body
unburied
be
lo
what
a
wife
was
alceste
quoth
she
what
saith
homer
of
good
penelope
all
greece
knoweth
of
her
chastity
pardie

thus
that
when

the

to

she
did
all

of

throughout
all
barbarie
o

thy

thus
plained

a
day
or
tway
purposing
ever
that
she
woulde

but
natheless
upon
the
thirde
night
home
came
arviragus
the
worthy
knight
and
asked
her
why
that
she
wept
so
sore
and
she
gan
weepen
ever

more
alas
quoth
she
that
ever
i
was

the
highest
thing
that

but
with
that
word
he
burst
anon
to
weep
and
said
i

pain
of

it
more
he
said
arviragus

als
how
loth
her
was

one
of

which

propose
for

in

of

the

tale
the
prologue
yea
let
that
passe
quoth
our
host
as
now
sir
doctor
of

i
praye
you
tell
us
a
tale
of
some
honest
mattere
it
shall
be
done
if
that
ye
will
it
hear
said
this
doctor
and
his

gan
anon
now
good
men
quoth
he
hearken
everyone
notes
to
the
prologue
to
the
doctor
tale
the
authenticity
of
the
prologue
is
questionable
it
is
found
in
one
manuscript
only
other
manuscripts
give
other
prologues
more
plainly
not
chaucer
than
this
and
some
manuscripts
have
merely
a
colophon
to
the
effect
that
here
endeth
the
franklin
tale
and
beginneth
the
physician
tale
without
a
prologue
the
tale
itself
is
the
story
of
virginia
with
several
departures
from
the
text
of
livy
chaucer
probably
followed
the
romance
of
the
rose
and
gower
confessio
amantis
in
both
of
which
the
story
is
found
the
tale
there
was
as
telleth
titus
livius
a
knight
that
called
was
virginius
full
filled
of
honour
and
worthiness
and
strong
of

of

this

that
man
may
see
for
nature
had
with
diligence
her
in
so
great
excellence
as
though
she
woulde
say
lo
i
nature
thus
can
i
form
and
paint
a
creature
when
that
me
list
who
can
me
counterfeit

shoulde
work
in

either
to

if
they

he
that
is
the
former
principal
hath
made
me
his
to
form
and
painten
earthly
creatures
right
as
me
list
and
all

in

under
the

that
may
wane

wax
and
for
my
work
right
nothing
will
i
my

and
i
be
full
of
one
accord
i
made
her
to
the
of
my
lord
so
do
i
all
mine
other
creatures
what
colour
that
they
have
or
what
figures
thus
seemeth
me
that
nature
woulde
say
this
maiden
was
of
age
twelve
year
and
tway
in
which
that
nature
hadde
such
delight
for
right
as
she
can
paint
a
lily
white
and
red
a
rose
right
with
such
painture
she
painted
had
this
noble
creature
ere
she
was
born
upon
her
limbes
free
where
as
by
right
such
colours
shoulde
be
and
phoebus
dyed
had
her
tresses
great
like
to
the
of
his
burned
heat
rays
and
if
that
excellent
was
her
beauty
a
more
virtuous
was
she
in
her
there
lacked
no
condition
that
is
to
praise
as
by
discretion
as
well
in
as
body
chaste
was
she
spirit
for
which
she
flower
in
virginity
with
all
humility
and
abstinence
with
alle
temperance
and
patience
with
eke
of
bearing
and

she
was
in

alway
though
she
were

as
pallas
dare
i
sayn
her
eke
full
womanly
and
plain
no

termes
hadde
she
to
seeme
wise
but
after
her
degree
she
spake
and
all
her
worde
more
and
less
sounding
in
virtue
and
in

shamefast
she
was

of

herself
full
often
sick
for
that
she
woulde
flee
the
company
where
likely
was
to

of

as

this
example
now
as
here
for
i
must
turn
again
to
my

this
maid
of
which
i
tell
my
tale
express
she
kept
herself
her
needed
no
mistress
for
in
her
living
maidens
mighte
read
as
in
a
book
good
word
and
deed
that
longeth
to
a
maiden
virtuous
she
was
so
prudent
and
so
bounteous
for
which
the
fame
out
sprang
on
every
side
both
of
her
beauty
and
her
wide
that
through
the
land
they
praised
her
each
one
that
loved
virtue
save
envy
alone
that
sorry
is
of
other
manne
weal
and
glad
is
of
his
sorrow
and
the
doctor
maketh
this
descriptioun
this
maiden
on
a
day
went
in
the
town
toward
a
temple
with
her
mother
dear
as
is
of
younge
maidens
the
mannere
now
was
there
then
a
justice
in
that
town
that
governor
was
of
that
regioun
and
so
befell
this
judge
his
eyen
cast
upon
this
maid
her
full
fast
as
she
came
forth
by
where
this
judge
stood
anon
his
hearte
changed
and
his
mood
so
was
he
caught
with
beauty
of
this
maid
and
to
himself
full
privily
he
said
this
maiden
shall
be
mine
any
man
what
any
anon
the
fiend
into
his
hearte
ran
man
may
and
taught
him
suddenly
that
he
by
sleight
this
maiden
to
his
purpose
winne
might
for
certes
by
no
force
nor
by
no
meed
reward
him
thought
he
was
not
able
for
to
speed
for
she
was
strong
of
friendes
and
eke
she
confirmed
was
in
such
bounte
that
well
he
wist
he
might
her
never
win
as
for
to
make
her
with
her
body
sin
for
which
with
great
deliberatioun
he
sent
after
a
clerk
was
in
the
town
the
which
he
knew
for
subtle
and
for
bold
this
judge
unto
this
clerk
his
tale
told
in
secret
wise
and
made
him
to
assure
he
shoulde
tell
it
to
no
creature
and
if
he
did
he
shoulde
lose
his
head
and
when
assented
was
this
cursed
rede
plot
glad
was
the
judge
and
made
him
greate
cheer
and
gave
him
giftes
precious
and
dear
when
was
all
their
conspiracy
from
point
to
point
how

to
present
as
he
sat
yet
in

and
when
the
judge
it
saw
as
saith
the
story
he
bade
to
take
him
and
to
hang
him
fast
but
right
anon
a
thousand
people
to
save
the
knight
for
ruth
and
for
pity
for
knowen
was
the
false
iniquity
the
people
anon
had
in
this
thing
by
manner
of
the
clerke
challenging
that
it
was
by
of
appius
they
wiste
well
that
he
was
lecherous
for
which
unto
this
appius
they
gon
and
cast
him
in
a
prison
right
anon
where
as
he
slew
himself
and
claudius
that
servant
was
unto
this
appius
was
doomed
for
to
hang
upon
a
tree
but
that
virginius
of
his
pity
so
prayed
for
him
that
he
was
exil
and
elles
certes
had
he
been
beguil
note
the
remenant
were
hanged
more
and
less
that
were
consenting
to
this
cursedness
here
men
may
see
how
sin
hath
his
merite
beware
for
no
man
knows
how
god
will
smite
in
no
degree
nor
in
which
manner
wise
the
worm
of

may
frighten
horrify
of

though
it

and
nothing
for
correction
of
sin
i
recke
never
when
that
they
be
buried
though
that
their
soules
go
a
for
certes
a
predication
is
often
inspired
cometh
of
evil
intention
by
evil
some
for
pleasance
of
folk
and
flattery
to
be
advanced
by
hypocrisy
and
some
for
vainglory
and
some
for
hate
for
when
i
dare
not
otherwise
debate
then
will
i
sting
him
with
my
tongue
in
preaching
so
that
he
shall
not
to
be
defamed
falsely
if
that
he
hath
to
my
brethren
or
to
me
for
though
i
telle
not
his
proper
name
men
shall
well
knowe
that
it
is
the
same
by
signes
and
by
other
circumstances
thus
folk
that
do
us
displeasances
am
revenged
thus
spit
i
out
my
venom
under
hue
of
holiness
to
seem
holy
and
true
but
shortly
mine
intent
i
will
devise
i
preach
of
nothing
but
of
covetise
therefore
my
theme
is
yet
and
ever
was
radix
malorum
est
cupiditas
thus
can
i
preach
against
the
same
vice
which
that
i
use
and
that
is
avarice
but
though
myself
be
guilty
in
that
sin
yet
can
i
maken
other
folk
to
from
avarice
and
sore
them
repent
but
that
is
not
my
principal
intent
i
preache
nothing
but
for
covetise
of
this
mattere
it
ought
enough
suffice
then
tell
i
them
examples
many
a
one
of
olde
stories
longe
time
gone
for
people
love
tales
old
such
thinges
can
they
well
report
and
hold
what
trowe
ye
that
whiles
i
may
preach
and
winne
gold
and
silver
i
teach
that
i
will
live
in
povert
wilfully
nay
nay
i
thought
it
never
truely
for
i
will
preach
and
beg
in
sundry
lands
i
will
not
do
no
labour
with
mine
hands
nor
make
baskets
for
to
live
thereby
because
i
will
not
beggen
idlely
i
will
none
of
the
apostles
counterfeit
in
poverty
i
will
have
money
wool
and
cheese
and
wheat
were
it
given
of
the
poorest
page
if
or
of
the
pooreste
widow
in
a
village
all
should
her
children
for
famine
nay
i
will
drink
the
liquor
of
the
vine
and
have
a
jolly
wench
in
every
town
but
hearken
lordings
in
conclusioun
your
liking
is
that
i
shall
tell
a
tale
now
i
have
drunk
a
draught
of
corny
ale
by
god
i
hope
i
shall
you
tell
a
thing
that
shall
by
reason
be
to
your
liking
for
though
myself
be
a
full
vicious
man
a
moral
tale
yet
i
you
telle
can
which
i
am
wont
to
preache
for
to
win
now
hold
your
peace
my
tale
i
will
begin
in
flanders
whilom
was
a
company
of
younge
folkes
that
haunted
folly
as
riot
hazard
stewes
and
taverns
where
as
with
lutes
harpes
and
giterns
they
dance
and
play
at
dice
both
day
and
night
and
eat
also
and
drink
over
their
might
through
which
they
do
the
devil
sacrifice
within
the
devil
temple
in
cursed
wise
by
superfluity
abominable
their
oathes
be
so
great
and
so
damnable
that
it
is
for
to
hear
them
swear
our
blissful
lorde
body
they
to
pieces
them
thought
the
jewes
rent
him
not
enough
and
each
of
them
at
other
sinne
lough
and
right
anon
in
come
tombesteres
and
small
and
younge
fruitesteres
singers
with
harpes
baudes
waferers
which
be
the
very
devil
officers
to
kindle
and
blow
the
fire
of
lechery
that
is
annexed
unto
gluttony
the
holy
writ
take
i
to
my
witness
that
luxury
is
in
wine
and
drunkenness
lo
how
that
drunken
lot
lay
by
his
daughters
two
unwittingly
so
drunk
he
was
he
knew
not
what
he
wrought
herodes
who
so
well
the
stories
sought
when
he
of
wine
replete
was
at
his
feast
right
at
his
owen
table
gave
his
to
slay
the
baptist
john
full
guilteless
seneca
saith
a
good
word
doubteless
he
saith
he
can
no
difference
find
betwixt
a
man
that
is
out
of
his
mind
and
a
man
whiche
that
is
drunkelew
drunkard
but
that
woodness
in
a
shrew
persevereth
longer
than
drunkenness
o
gluttony
full
of
all
cursedness
o
cause
first
of
our
confusion
original
of
our
damnation
till
christ
had
bought
us
with
his
blood
again
looke
how
deare
shortly
for
to
sayn
was
first
this
cursed
villainy
for
corrupt
was
all
this
world
for
gluttony
adam
our
father
and
his
wife
also
from
paradise
to
labour
and
to
woe
were
driven
for
that
vice
it
is
no
dread
for
while
that
adam
fasted
as
i
read
he
was
in
paradise
and
when
that
he
ate
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
anon
he
was
cast
out
to
woe
and
pain
o
gluttony
well
ought
us
on
thee
plain
oh
wist
a
man
how
many
maladies
follow
of
excess
and
of
gluttonies
he
woulde
be
the
more

his
diete
sitting
at
his
table
alas
the
shorte
throat
the
tender
mouth
maketh

paulus
saith
alas
a
foul
thing
is
it
by
my
faith
to
say
this
word
and
fouler
is
the
deed
when

so
drinketh
of

red
that
of
his
throat
he
maketh

the

weeping
with

how
great

is
thee
to

into

to

talent
out
of

have
a
newer

but
certes
he
that
haunteth
such
delices
is
dead
while
that
he
liveth
in
those
vices
a
lecherous
thing
is
wine
and
drunkenness
is
full
of
striving
and
of
wretchedness
o
drunken
man
disfgur
is
thy
face
sour
is
thy
breath
foul
art
thou
to

through

sowneth
the

as
though
thous
saidest
aye
samsoun
samsoun
and
yet
god
wot
samson
drank
never
wine
thou
fallest
as
it
were
a
sticked
swine
thy
tongue
is
lost
and
all
thine
honest
cure
for
drunkenness
is
very
of
manne
wit
and
his
discretion
in
whom
that
drink
hath
domination
he
can
no
counsel
keep
it
is
no
dread
now
keep
you
from
the
white
and
from
the
red
and
from
the
white
wine
of
lepe
that
is
to
sell
in
fish
street
and
in
cheap
this
wine
of
spaine
creepeth
subtilly
in
other
wines
growing
faste
by
of
which
there
riseth
such
fumosity
that
when
a
man
hath
drunken
draughtes
three
and
weeneth
that
he
be
at
home
in
cheap
he
is
in
spain
right
at
the
town
of
lepe
not
at
the
rochelle
nor
at
bourdeaux
town
and
thenne
will
he
say
samsoun
samsoun
but
hearken
lordings
one
word
i
you
pray
that
all
the
sovreign
actes
dare
i
say
of
victories
in
the
old
testament
through
very
god
that
is
omnipotent
were
done
in
abstinence
and
in
prayere
look
in
the
bible
and
there
ye
may
it
lear
look
attila
the
greate
conqueror
died
in
his
sleep
with
shame
and
dishonour
bleeding
aye
at
his
nose
in
drunkenness
a
captain
should
aye
live
in
soberness
and
all
this
you
right
well
bethink
what
was
commanded
unto
lemuel
not
samuel
but
lemuel
say
reade
the
bible
and
find
it
expressly
of
wine
giving
to
them
that
have
justice
no
more
of
this
for
it
may
well
suffice
and
now
that
i
have
spoke
of
gluttony
now
will
i
you
hazardry
hazard
is
very
mother
of
leasings
and
of
deceit
and
cursed
forswearings
blasphem
of
christ
manslaughter
and
waste
also
of
and
of
time
and
furthermo
it
is
repreve
and
contrar
of
honour
for
to
be
held
a
common
hazardour
and
ever
the
higher
he
is
of
estate
the
more
he
is
holden
desolate
worthless
if
that
a
prince
use
hazardry
in
alle
governance
and
policy
he
is
as
by
common
opinion
the
less
in
reputation
chilon
that
was
a
wise
ambassador
was
sent
to
corinth
with
full
great
honor
from
lacedemon
to
make
alliance
and
when
he
came
it
happen
him
by
chance
that
all
the
greatest
that
were
of
that
land
atte
hazard
he
them
fand
for
which
as
soon
as
that
it
mighte
be
he
stole
him
home
again
to
his
country
and
saide
there
i
will
not
lose
my
name
nor
will
i
take
on
me
so
great
diffame
you
to
ally
unto
no
hazardors
sende
some
other
wise
ambassadors
for
by
my
troth
me
were
die
than
i
should
you
to
hazardors
ally
for
ye
that
be
so
glorious
in
honours
shall
not
ally
you
to
no
hazardours
as
by
my
will
nor
as
by
my
treaty
this
wise
philosopher
thus
said
he
look
eke
how
to
the
king
demetrius
the
king
of
parthes
as
the
book
saith
us
sent
him
a
pair
of
dice
of
gold
in
scorn
for
he
had
used
hazard
therebeforn
for
which
he
held
his
glory
and
renown
at
no
value
or
reputatioun
lordes
may
finden
other
manner
play
honest
enough
to
drive
the
day
away
now
will
i
speak
of
oathes
false
and
great
a
word
or
two
as
olde
bookes
treat
great
swearing
is
a
thing
abominable
and
false
swearing
is
more
reprovable
the
highe
god
forbade
swearing
at
all
witness
on
matthew
but
in
special
of
swearing
saith
the
holy
jeremie
thou
thalt
swear
sooth
thine
oathes
and
not
lie
and
swear
in
and
eke
in
righteousness
but
idle
swearing
is
a
cursedness
behold
and
see
there
in
the
firste
table
of
highe
godde
honourable
how
that
the
second
best
of
him
is
this
take
not
my
name
in
or
amiss
vain
lo
he
forbiddeth
such
swearing
than
homicide
or
many
a
cursed
thing
i
say
that
as
by
order
thus
it
standeth
this
knoweth
he
that
his
understandeth
how
that
the
second
hest
of
god
is
that
and
farthermore
i
will
thee
tell
all
plat
plainly
that
vengeance
shall
not
parte
from
his
house
that
of
his
oathes
is
outrageous
by
godde
precious
heart
and
by
his
nails
and
by
the
blood
of
christ
that
is
in
hailes
seven
is
my
chance
and
thine
is
cinque
and
trey
by
godde
armes
if
thou
falsely
play
this
dagger
shall
throughout
thine
hearte
go
this
fruit
comes
of
the
bones
two
cursed
bones
dice
forswearing
ire
falseness
and
homicide
now
for
the
love
of
christ
that
for
us
died
leave
your
oathes
bothe
great
and
smale
but
sirs
now
will
i
ell
you
forth
my
tale
these
riotoures
three
of
which
i
tell
long
prime
rang
of
any
bell
were
set
them
in
a
tavern
for
to
drink
and
as
they
sat
they
heard
a
belle
clink
before
a
corpse
was
carried
to
the
grave
that
one
of
them
gan
calle
to
his
knave
go
bet
quoth
he
and
aske
readily
what
corpse
is
this
that
passeth
here
forth
by
and
look
that
thou
report
his
name
well
sir
quoth
the
boy
it
needeth
never
a
deal
it
was
me
told
ere
ye
came
here
two
hours
he
was
pardie
an
old
fellow
of
yours
and
suddenly
he
was
as
he
sat
on
his
bench
upright
drunk
there
came
a
privy
thief
men
clepe
death
that
in
this
country
all
the
people
and
with
his
spear
he
smote
his
heart
in
two
and
went
his
way
withoute
wordes
mo
he
hath
a
thousand
slain
this
pestilence
and
master
ere
you
come
in
his
presence
me
thinketh
that
it
were
full
necessary
for
to
beware
of
such
an
adversary
be
ready
for
to
meet
him
evermore
thus
taughte
me
my
dame
i
say
no
more
by
sainte
mary
said
the
tavernere
the
child
saith
sooth
for
he
hath
slain
this
year
hence
a
mile
within
a
great
village
both
man
and
woman
child
and
hind
and
page
i
trow
his
habitation
be
there
to
be
great
wisdom
it
were
on
one
guard
that
he
did
a
man
a
dishonour
yea
godde
armes
quoth
this
riotour
is
it
such
peril
with
him
for
to
meet
i
shall
him
seek
by
stile
and
eke
by
street
i
make
a
vow
by
godde
bones
hearken
fellows
we
three
be
alle
ones
one
let
each
of
us
hold
up
his
hand
to
other
and
each
of
us
become
the
other
brother
and
we
will
slay
this
false
traitor
death
he
shall
be
slain
he
that
so
many
by
godde
dignity
ere
it
be
night
together
have
these
three
their
trothe
plight
to
live
and
die
each
one
of
them
for
other
as
though
he
were
his
owen
sworen
brother
and
up
they
start
all
drunken
in
this
rage
and
forth
they
go
towardes
that
village
of
which
the
taverner
had
spoke
beforn
and
many
a
oathe
have
they
sworn
and
christe
blessed
body
they
to
pieces
death
shall
be
dead
if
that
we
may
him
hent
when
they
had
gone
not
fully
half
a
mile
right
as
they
would
have
trodden
a
stile
an
old
man
and
a
poore
with
them
met
this
olde
man
full
meekely
them
gret
and
saide
thus
now
lordes
god
you
see
on
graciously
the
proudest
of
these
riotoures
three
answer
again
what
churl
with
sorry
grace
why
art
thou
all
save
thy
face
wrapt
up
why
livest
thou
so
long
in
so
great
age
this
olde
man
gan
look
on
his
visage
and
saide
thus
for
that
i
can
not
find
a
man
though
that
i
walked
unto
ind
neither
in
city
nor
in
no
village
go
that
woulde
change
his
youthe
for
mine
age
and
therefore
must
i
have
mine
age
still
as
longe
time
as
it
is
godde
will
and
death
alas
he
will
not
have
my
life
thus
walk
i
like
a
resteless
caitife
wretch
and
on
the
ground
which
is
my
mother
gate
i
knocke
with
my
staff
early
and
late
and
say
to
her
mother
let
me
in
lo
how
i
wane
flesh
and
blood
and
skin
alas
when
shall
my
bones
be
at
rest
mother
with
you
i
woulde
change
my
chest
that
in
my
chamber
longe
time
hath
be
yea
for
an
hairy
clout
to
in
me
myself
but
yet
to
me
she
will
not
do
that
grace
for
which
fall
pale
and
is
my
face
but
sirs
to
you
it
is
no
courtesy
to
speak
unto
an
old
man
villainy
he
trespass
in
word
or
else
in
deed
in
holy
writ
ye
may
yourselves
read
an
old
man
hoar
upon
his
head
meet
ye
should
arise
therefore
i
you
rede
ne
do
unto
an
old
man
no
harm
now
no
more
than
ye
would
a
man
did
you
in
age
if
that
ye
may
so
long
abide
and
god
be
with
you
whether
ye
go
or
ride
i
must
go
thither
as
i
have
to
go
nay
olde
churl
by
god
thou
shalt
not
so
saide
this
other
hazardor
anon
thou
partest
not
so
lightly
by
saint
john
thou
spakest
right
now
of
that
traitor
death
that
in
this
country
all

crooked
way
for
in
that
grove
i
left

and
there

right
there
ye
shall

that
bought
again
mankind
and
you
amend
thus
said
this
olde
man
and
evereach
of
these
riotoures
ran
till
they
came
to
the
tree
and
there
they
found
of
florins
fine
of
gold
round
well
nigh
a
seven
bushels
as
them
thought
no
longer
as
then
after
death
they
sought
but
each
of
them
so
glad
was
of
the
sight
for
that
the
florins
were
so
fair
and
bright
that
down
they
sat
them
by
the
precious
hoard
the
youngest
of
them
spake
the
firste
word
brethren
quoth
he
what
i
shall
say
my
wit
is
great
though
that
i
and
play
frolic
this
treasure
hath
fortune
unto
us
given
in
mirth
and
jollity
our
life
to
liven
and
lightly
as
it
comes
so
will
we
spend
hey
godde
precious
dignity
who
thought
today
that
we
should
have
so
fair
a
grace
but
might
this
gold
he
carried
from
this
place
home
to
my
house
or
elles
unto
yours
for
well
i
wot
that
all
this
gold
is
ours
then
were
we
in
high
felicity
but
truely
by
day
it
may
not
be
men
woulde
say
that
we
were
thieves
strong
and
for
our
owen
treasure
do
us
hong
us
hanged
this
treasure
muste
carried
be
by
night
as
wisely
and
as
slily
as
it
might
wherefore
i
rede
that
among
us
all
we
draw
and
let
see
where
the
cut
will
fall
and
he
that
hath
the
cut
with
hearte
blithe
shall
run
unto
the
town
and
that
full
swithe
and
bring
us
bread
and
wine
full
privily
and
two
of
us
shall
keepe
subtilly
this
treasure
well
and
if
he
will
not
tarry
when
it
is
night
we
will
this
treasure
carry
by
one
assent
where
as
us
thinketh
best
then
one
of
them
the
cut
brought
in
his
fist
and
bade
them
draw
and
look
where
it
would
fall
and
it
fell
on
the
youngest
of
them
all
and
forth
toward
the
town
he
went
anon
and
all
so
soon
as
that
he
was
the
one
of
them
spake
thus
unto
the
other
thou
knowest
well
that
thou
art
my
sworn
brother
will
i
tell
thee
right
anon
is
for
thine
thou
knowest
well
that
our
fellow
is
gone
and
here
is
gold
and
that
full
great
plenty
that
shall
he
among
us
three
but
natheless
if
i
could
it
so
that
it
departed
were
among
us
two
had
i
not
done
a
friende
turn
to
thee
th
other
answer
i
how
that
may
be
not
he
knows
well
that
the
gold
is
with
us
tway
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
to
him
say
shall
it
be
counsel
said
the
firste
shrew
and
i
shall
tell
to
thee
in
wordes
few
what
we
shall
do
and
bring
it
well
about
i
grante
quoth
the
other
out
of
doubt
that
by
my
truth
i
will
thee
not
bewray
now
quoth
the
first
thou
well
we
be
tway
and
two
of
us
shall
stronger
be
than
one
look
when
that
he
is
set
thou
right
anon
down
arise
as
though
thou
wouldest
with
him
play
and
i
shall
him
through
the
sides
tway
while
that
thou
strugglest
with
him
as
in
game
and
with
thy
dagger
look
thou
do
the
same
and
then
shall
all
this
gold
be
my
deare
friend
betwixte
thee
and
me
then
may
we
both
our
all
fulfil
and
play
at
dice
right
at
our
owen
will
and
thus
be
these
tway
to
slay
the
third
as
ye
have
heard
me
say
the
youngest
which
that
wente
to
the
town
full
oft
in
heart
he
rolled
up
and
down
the
beauty
of
these
florins
new
and
bright
o
lord
quoth
he
if
so
were
that
i
might
have
all
this
treasure
to
myself
alone
there
is
no
man
that
lives
under
the
throne
of
god
that
shoulde
have
so
merry
as
i
and
at
the
last
the
fiend
our
enemy
put
in
his
thought
that
he
should
poison
buy
with
which
he
mighte
slay
his
fellows
twy
for
why
the
fiend
found
him
such
living
such
a
that
he
had
leave
to
sorrow
him
to
bring
bad
for
this
was
utterly
his
full
intent
to
slay
them
both
and
never
to
repent
and
forth
he
went
no
longer
would
he
tarry
into
the
town
to
an
apothecary
and
prayed
him
that
he
him
woulde
sell
some
poison
that
he
might
rattes
quell
his
and
eke
there
was
a
polecat
in
his
haw
hedge
that
as
he
said
his
eapons
had
and
fain
he
would
him
wreak
if
that
he
might
of
vermin
that
destroyed
him
by
night
answer
thou
shalt
have
a
thing
as
god
my
soule
save
in
all
this
world
there
is
no
creature
that
eat
or
drank
hath
of
this
confecture
not
but
the
of
a
corn
of
wheat
that
he
shall
not
his
life
forlete
lay
yea
he
shall
and
that
in
lesse
while
than
thou
wilt
go
nought
but
a
mile
this
poison
is
so
strong
and
violent
this
cursed
man
hath
in
his
hand
this
poison
in
a
box
and
swift
he
ran
into
the
nexte
street
unto
a
man
and
borrow
of
him
large
bottles
three
and
in
the
two
the
poison
poured
he
the
third
he
kepte
clean
for
his
own
drink
for
all
the
night
he
shope
for
to
in
carrying
off
the
gold
out
of
that
place
and
when
this
riotour
with
sorry
grace
had
fill
with
wine
his
greate
bottles
three
to
his
fellows
again
repaired
he
what
needeth
it
thereof
to
more
discourse
for
right
as
they
had
his
death
before
right
so
they
have
him
slain
and
that
anon
and
when
that
this
was
done
thus
spake
the
one
now
let
us
sit
and
drink
and
make
us
merry
and
afterward
we
will
his
body
bury
and
with
that
word
it
happen
him
chance
to
take
the
bottle
where
the
poison
was
and
drank
and
gave
his
fellow
drink
also
for
which
anon
they
both
the
two
but
certes
i
suppose
that
avicen
wrote
never
in
no
canon
nor
no
fen
more
wondrous
signes
of
empoisoning
than
had
these
wretches
two
ere
their
ending
thus
ended
be
these
homicides
two
and
eke
the
false
empoisoner
also
o
cursed

of
all
cursedness
o

o

o

the

answered
not

notes
to
the
pardoner
tale
the
outline
of
this
tale
is
to
be
found
in
the
cento
novelle
antiche
but
the
original
is
now
lost
as
in
the
case
of
the
wife
of
bath
tale
there
is
a
long
prologue
but
in
this
case
it
has
been
treated
as
part
of
the
tale

from

had
she
taken
priestes
two
or
three
even
if
she
had
committed
adultery
with
two
or
three
priests
blackburied
the
meaning
of
this
is
not
very
clear
but
it
is
probably
a
periphrastic
and
picturesque
way
of
indicating
damnation
grisly
dreadful
fitted
to
agrise
or
horrify
the
listener
mr
wright
says
the
common
oaths
in
the
middle
ages
were
by
the
different
parts
of
god
body
and
the
popular
preachers
represented
that
profane
swearers
tore
christ
body
by
their
imprecations
the
idea
was
doubtless
borrowed
from
the
passage
in
hebrews
vi
where
apostates
are
said
to
crucify
to
themselves
the
son
of
god
afresh

tale
the
prologue
here
given
was
transferred
by
tyrwhitt
from
the
place
preceding
the
squire
tale
which
it
had
formerly
occupied
the
shipman
tale
having
no
prologue
in
the
best
manuscripts
lollard
a
contemptuous
name
for
the
followers
of
wyckliffe
presumably
derived
from
the
latin
lolium
tares
as
if
they
were
the
tares
among
the
lord
wheat
so
a
few
lines
below
the
shipman
intimates
his
fear
lest
the
parson
should
spring
cockle
in
our
clean
corn
cockle
a
weed
the
agrostemma
githago
of
linnaeus
perhaps
named
from
the
ceocan
because
it
chokes
the
corn
transcriber
note
it
is
also
possible
chaucer
had
in
mind
matthew
where
in
some
translations
an
enemy
sowed
cockle
amongst
the
wheat
other

have
tares
and
darnel
the
tale
a
merchant
whilom
dwell
at
saint
denise
that
riche
was
for
which
men
held
him
wise
a
wife
he
had
of
excellent
beauty
and
and
was
she
of
society
and
which
is
a
thing
that
causeth
more
dispence
merry
than
worth
is
all
the
cheer
and
reverence
that
men
them
do
at
feastes
and
at
dances
such
salutations
and
countenances
passen
as
doth
the
shadow
on
the
wall
put
woe
is
him
that
paye
must
for
all
the
husband
he
must
pay
he
must
us
clothe
and
he
must
us
array
all
for
his
owen
worship
richely
in
which
array
we
dance
jollily
and
if
that
he
may
not
paraventure
or
elles
list
not
such
dispence
endure
but
thinketh
it
is
wasted
and
then
must
another
paye
for
our
cost
or
lend
us
gold
and
that
is
perilous
this
noble
merchant
held
a
noble
house
for
which
he
had
all
day
so
great
repair
of
visitors
for
his
largesse
and
for
his
wife
was
fair
that
wonder
is
but
hearken
to
my
tale
amonges
all
these
guestes
great
and
smale
there
was
a
monk
a
fair
man
and
a
bold
i
trow
a
thirty
winter
he
was
old
that
was
drawing
to
that
place
this
younge
monk
that
was
so
fair
of
face
acquainted
was
so
with
this
goode
man
since
that
their
firste
knowledge
began
that
in
his
house
as
familiar
was
he
as
it
is
possible
any
friend
to
be
and
for
as
muchel
as
this
goode
man
and
eke
this
monk
of
which
that
i
began
were
both
the
two
in
one
village
the
monk
claimed
as
for
cousinage
kindred
and
he
again
him
said
not
once
nay
with
but
was
as
glad
thereof
as
fowl
of
day
for
to
his
heart
it
was
a
great
pleasance
thus
be
they
knit
with
etern
alliance
and
each
of
them
gan
other
to
assure
of
brotherhood
while
that
their
life
may
dure
free
was
dan
john
and
of
dispence
as
in
that
house
and
full
of
diligence
to
do
pleasance
and
also
costage
he
not
forgot
to
give
the
leaste
page
in
all
that
house
but
after
their
degree
he
gave
the
lord
and
his
meinie
when
that
he
came
some
manner
honest
thing
for
which
they
were
as
glad
of
his
coming
as
fowl
is
fain
when
that
the
sun
upriseth
no
more
of
this
as
now
for
it
sufficeth
but
so
befell
this
merchant
on
a
day
him
to
make
ready
his
array
arranged
toward
the
town
of
bruges
for
to
fare
to
buye
there
a
portion
of
ware
for
which
he
hath
to
paris
sent
anon
a
messenger
and
prayed
hath
dan
john
that
he
should
come
to
saint
denis
and
himself
with
him
and
with
his
wife
a
day
or
tway
ere
he
to
bruges
went
in
alle
wise
this
noble
monk
of
which
i
you
devise
had
of
his
abbot
as
him
list
licence
because
he
was
a
man
of
high
prudence
and
eke
an
officer
out
for
to
ride
to
see
their
granges
and
their
barnes
wide
and
unto
saint
denis
he
came
anon
who
was
so
welcome
as
my
lord
dan
john
our
deare
cousin
full
of
courtesy
with
him
he
brought
a
of
malvesie
and
eke
another
full
of
fine
vernage
and
volatile
as
aye
was
his
usage
and
thus
i
let
them
eat
and
drink
and
play
this
merchant
and
this
monk
a
day
or
tway
the
thirde
day
the
merchant
up
ariseth
and
on
his
needeis
sadly
him
adviseth
and
up
into
his
went
he
to
reckon
with
himself
as
well
may
be
of
year
how
that
it
with
him
stood
and
how
that
he
dispended
bad
his
good
and
if
that
he
increased
were
or
non
his
bookes
and
his
bagges
many
a
one
he
laid
before
him
on
his
full
riche
was
his
treasure
and
his
hoard
for
which
full
fast
his
countour
door
he
shet
and
eke
he
would
that
no
man
should
him
of
his
accountes
for
the
meane
time
and
thus
he
sat
till
it
was
passed
prime
dan
john
was
risen
in
the
morn
also
and
in
the
garden
walked
to

had
his
thinges
said
full
courteously
the
good
wife
came
walking
full
privily
into
the
garden
where
he
walked
soft
and
him
saluted
as
she
had
done
oft
a

my
prow
for
cousinage
and
eke

thus
endeth
now
my
tale
and
god
us
send
taling
enough
until
our
lives
end
notes
to
the
shipman
tale
in
this
tale
chaucer
seems
to
have
followed
an
old
french
story
which
also
formed
the
groundwork
of
the
first
story
in
the
eighth
day
of
the
decameron
he
must
us
clothe
so
in
all
the
manuscripts
and
from
this
and
the
following
lines
it
must
be
inferred
that
chaucer
had
intended
to
put
the
tale
in
the
mouth
of
a
female
speaker
dan
a
title
bestowed
on
priests
and
scholars
from
dominus
like
the
spanish
don
bruges
was
in
chaucer
time
the
great
emporium
of
european
commerce
the
monk
had
been
appointed
by
his
abbot
to
inspect
and
manage
the
rural
property
of
the
monastery
malvesie
or
malmesy
wine
derived
its
name
from
malvasia
a
region
of
the
morea
near
cape
malea
where
it
was
made
as
it
also
was
on
chios
and
some
other
greek
islands
vernage
was
vernaccia
a
sweet
italian
wine
french
comptoir
under
the
yarde
under
the
rod
in
pupillage
a
phrase
properly
used
of
children
but
employed
by
the
clerk
in
the
prologue
to
his
tale
see
note
to
the
prologue
to
the
tale
genelon
ganelon
or
ganilion
one
of
officers
whose
treachery
was
the
cause
of
the
disastrous
defeat
of
the
christians
by
the
saracens
at
roncevalles
he
was
torn
to
pieces
by
four
horses
elenge
from
french
eloigner
to
remove
it
may
mean
either
the
lonely
cheerless
condition
of
the
priest
or
the
strange
behaviour
of
the
merchant
in
leaving
him
to
himself
make
a
chevisance
raise
money
by
means
of
a
borrowing
agreement
from
french
achever
to
finish
the
general
meaning
of
the
word
is
a
bargain

and
let
us

about

of

with

say
there
was
in

amonges

jewery
sustained
by
a
lord
of
that
country
for
foul
usure
and
lucre
of
villainy
hateful
to
christ
and
to
his
company
and
through
the
street
men
mighte
ride
and
wend
walk
for
it
was
free
and
open
at
each
end
a
little
school
of
christian
folk
there
stood
down
at
the
farther
end
in
which
there
were
children
an
heap
of
christian
blood
that
learned
in
that
schoole
year
by
year
such
manner
doctrine
as
men
used
there
this
is
to
say
to
singen
and
to
read
as
smalle
children
do
in
their
childhead
among
these
children
was
a

have
said
throughout
the
jewery
this

of
such
sentence
which
is
against
your
lawe
reverence
from
thenceforth
the
jewes
have
conspired

innocent
out
of
the
world
to
chase
a
homicide

they
hired

in
an
alley

cursed
deed
o

now

the
white
lamb
celestial
quoth
she
of
which
the
great
evangelist
saint
john
in

wrote
which
saith
that

woman
they
ne
this
poore

that
night
after

but
he
came
not
for
which
as
soon
as
it
was
daye
light
with
face
pale
in
dread
and
busy
thought

hath
at

and
elleswhere

sought
till
finally
she
gan
so
far
espy
that
he
was
last
seen
in
the
jewery
with
mother
pity
in
her
breast
enclosed
she
went
as
she
were
half
out
of
her
mind
to
every
place
where
she
hath
supposed
by
likelihood
her
little
child
to
find
and
ever
on
christ
mother
meek
and
kind
she
cried
and
at
the
laste
thus
she
wrought
among
the
cursed
jewes
she
him
sought
she
freined
and
she
prayed
piteously
to
every
jew
that
dwelled
in
that
place
to
tell
her
if
her
childe
went
thereby
they
saide
nay
but
jesus
of
his
grace
gave
in
her
thought
within
a
little
space
that
in
that
place
after
her
son
she
cried
where
he
was
cast
into
a
pit
beside
o

eke
of

ruby
bright
where
he
with
throat
lay
upright

alma
redemptoris
gan
to
sing
so
loud
that
all
the
place
began
to
ring
the
christian
folk
that
through
the
streete
went
in
came
for
to
wonder
on
this
thing
and
hastily
they

tales
of

probably
designed

keep

the
bitter
feeling
of
the
christians
against
the
jews
not
a
few
children
were
canonised
on
this
account

the

interesting
for
the
picture
which
it
gives
of
chaucer
himself
riding
apart
from

indifferent
to
the
rest
of
the
pilgrims
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
an
elvish
morose
or
rather
air
portly
if
not
actually
stout
in
body
and
evidently
a
man
out
of
the

the

tale
of

chaucer
crowns
the
satire
on
the
romanticists
by
making
the
very
landlord
of
the
tabard
cry
out
in
indignant
disgust
against
the
stuff
which
he
had
heard
recited
the
good
host
ascribing
to
sheer
ignorance
the
string
of
pompous
platitudes
and
prosaic
details
which
chaucer
had
uttered
drafty
worthless
vile
no
better
than
draff
or
dregs
from
the
drifan
to
drive
away
expel
the
a
young
man
called
meliboeus
mighty
and
rich
begat
upon
his
wife
that
called
was
prudence
a
daughter
which
that
called
was
sophia
upon
a
day
befell
that
he
for
his
disport
went
into
the
fields
him
to
play
his
wife
and
eke
his
daughter
hath
he
left
within
his
house
of
which
the
doors
were
fast
shut
three
of
his
old
foes
have
it
espied
and
set
ladders
to
the
walls
of
his
house
and
by
the
windows
be
entered
and
beaten
his
wife
and
wounded
his
daughter
with
five
mortal
wounds
in
five
sundry
places
that
is
to
say
in
her
feet
in
her
hands
in
her
ears
in
her
nose
and
in
her
mouth
and
left
her
for
dead
and
went
away
when
meliboeus
returned
was
into
his
house
and
saw
all
this
mischief
he
like
a
man
mad
rending
his
clothes
gan
weep
and
cry
prudence
his
wife
as
farforth
as
she
durst
besought
him
of
his
weeping
for
to
stint
but
not
forthy
notwithstanding
he
gan
to
weep
and
cry
ever
longer
the
more
this
noble
wife
prudence
remembered
her
upon
the
sentence
of
ovid
in
his
book
that
called
is
the
remedy
of
love
where
he
saith
he
is
a
fool
that
disturbeth
the
mother
to
weep
in
the
death
of
her
child
till
she
have
wept
her
fill
as
for
a
certain
time
and
then
shall
a
man
do
his
diligence
with
amiable
words
her
to
recomfort
and
pray
her
of
her
weeping
for
to
stint
cease
for
which
reason
this
noble
wife
prudence
suffered
her
husband
for
to
weep
and
cry
as
for
a
certain
space
and
when
she
saw
her
time
she
said
to
him
in
this
wise
alas
my
lord
quoth
she
why
make
ye
yourself
for
to
be
like
a
fool
for
sooth
it
appertaineth
not
to
a
wise
man
to
make
such
a
sorrow
your
daughter
with
the
grace
of
god
shall
warish
be
cured
and
escape
and
all
although
were
it
so
that
she
right
now
were
dead
ye
ought
not
for
her
death
yourself
to
destroy
seneca
saith
wise
man
shall
not
take
too
great
discomfort
for
the
death
of
his
children
but
certes
he
should
suffer
it
in
patience
as
well
as
he
abideth
the
death
of
his
own
proper
person
meliboeus
answered
anon
and
said
what
man
quoth
he
should
of
his
weeping
stint
that
hath
so
great
a
cause
to
weep
jesus
christ
our
lord
himself
wept
for
the
death
of
lazarus
his
friend
prudence
answered
certes
well
i
wot
attempered
moderate
weeping
is
nothing
defended
forbidden
to
him
that
sorrowful
is
among
folk
in
sorrow
but
it
is
rather
granted
him
to
weep
the
apostle
paul
unto
the
romans
writeth
shall
rejoice
with
them
that
make
joy
and
weep
with
such
folk
as
weep
but
though
temperate
weeping
be
granted
outrageous
weeping
certes
is
defended
measure
of
weeping
should
be
conserved
after
the
lore
doctrine
that
teacheth
us
seneca
that
thy
friend
is
dead
quoth
he
not
thine
eyes
too
moist
be
of
tears
nor
too
much
dry
although
the
tears
come
to
thine
eyes
let
them
not
fall
and
when
thou
hast
forgone
lost
thy
friend
do
diligence
to
get
again
another
friend
and
this
is
more
wisdom
than
to
weep
for
thy
friend
which
that
thou
hast
lorn
lost
for
therein
is
no
boot
advantage
and
therefore
if
ye
govern
you
by
sapience
put
away
sorrow
out
of
your
heart
remember
you
that
jesus
sirach
saith
man
that
is
joyous
and
glad
in
heart
it
him
conserveth
flourishing
in
his
age
but
soothly
a
sorrowful
heart
maketh
his
bones
dry
he
said
eke
thus
sorrow
in
heart
slayth
full
many
a
man
solomon
saith
right
as
moths
in
the
sheep
fleece
annoy
do
injury
to
the
clothes
and
the
small
worms
to
the
tree
right
so
annoyeth
sorrow
to
the
heart
of
man
wherefore
us
ought
as
well
in
the
death
of
our
children
as
in
the
loss
of
our
goods
temporal
have
patience
remember
you
upon
the
patient
job
when
he
had
lost
his
children
and
his
temporal
substance
and
in
his
body
endured
and
received
full
many
a
grievous
tribulation
yet
said
he
thus
lord
hath
given
it
to
me
our
lord
hath
bereft
it
me
right
as
our
lord
would
right
so
be
it
done
blessed
be
the
name
of
our
lord
to
these
foresaid
things
answered
meliboeus
unto
his
wife
prudence
all
thy
words
quoth
he
be
true
and
thereto
also
profitable
but
truly
mine
heart
is
troubled
with
this
sorrow
so
grievously
that
i
know
not
what
to
do
let
call
quoth
prudence
thy
true
friends
all
and
thy
lineage
which
be
wise
and
tell
to
them
your
case
and
hearken
what
they
say
in
counselling
and
govern
you
after
their
sentence
opinion
solomon
saith
all
things
by
counsel
and
thou
shall
never
repent
then
by
counsel
of
his
wife
prudence
this
meliboeus
let
call
sent
for
a
great
congregation
of
folk
as
surgeons
physicians
old
folk
and
young
and
some
of
his
old
enemies
reconciled
as
by
their
semblance
to
his
love
and
to
his
grace
and
therewithal
there
come
some
of
his
neighbours
that
did
him
reverence
more
for
dread
than
for
love
as
happeneth
oft
there
come
also
full
many
subtle
flatterers
and
wise
advocates
learned
in
the
law
and
when
these
folk
together
assembled
were
this
meliboeus
in
sorrowful
wise
showed
them
his
case
and
by
the
manner
of
his
speech
it
seemed
that
in
heart
he
bare
a
cruel
ire
ready
to
do
vengeance
upon
his
foes
and
suddenly
desired
that
the
war
should
begin
but
nevertheless
yet
asked
he
their
counsel
in
this
matter
a
surgeon
by
licence
and
assent
of
such
as
were
wise
up
rose
and
to
meliboeus
said
as
ye
may
hear
sir
quoth
he
as
to
us
surgeons
appertaineth
that
we
do
to
every
wight
the
best
that
we
can
where
as
we
be
withholden
employed
and
to
our
patient
that
we
do
no
damage
wherefore
it
happeneth
many
a
time
and
oft
that
when
two
men
have
wounded
each
other
one
same
surgeon
healeth
them
both
wherefore
unto
our
art
it
is
not
pertinent
to
nurse
war
nor
parties
to
support
take
sides
but
certes
as
to
the
warishing
healing
of
your
daughter
albeit
so
that
perilously
she
be
wounded
we
shall
do
so
attentive
business
from
day
to
night
that
with
the
grace
of
god
she
shall
be
whole
and
sound
as
soon
as
is
possible
almost
right
in
the
same
wise
the
physicians
answered
save
that
they
said
a
few
words
more
that
right
as
maladies
be
cured
by
their
contraries
right
so
shall
man
warish
war
by
peace
his
neighbours
full
of
envy
his
feigned
friends
that
seemed
reconciled
and
his
flatterers
made
semblance
of
weeping
and
impaired
and
agregged
aggravated
much
of
this
matter
in
praising
greatly
meliboeus
of
might
of
power
of
riches
and
of
friends
despising
the
power
of
his
adversaries
and
said
utterly
that
he
anon
should
wreak
him
on
his
foes
and
begin
war
up
rose
then
an
advocate
that
was
wise
by
leave
and
by
counsel
of
other
that
were
wise
and
said
lordings
the
need
business
for
which
we
be
assembled
in
this
place
is
a
full
heavy
thing
and
an
high
matter
because
of
the
wrong
and
of
the
wickedness
that
hath
been
done
and
eke
by
reason
of
the
great
damages
that
in
time
coming
be
possible
to
fall
for
the
same
cause
and
eke
by
reason
of
the
great
riches
and
power
of
the
parties
both
for
which
reasons
it
were
a
full
great
peril
to
err
in
this
matter
wherefore
meliboeus
this
is
our
sentence
opinion
we
counsel
you
above
all
things
that
right
anon
thou
do
thy
diligence
in
keeping
of
thy
body
in
such
a
wise
that
thou
want
no
espy
nor
watch
thy
body
to
save
and
after
that
we
counsel
that
in
thine
house
thou
set
sufficient
garrison
so
that
they
may
as
well
thy
body
as
thy
house
defend
but
certes
to
move
war
or
suddenly
to
do
vengeance
we
may
not
deem
judge
in
so
little
time
that
it
were
profitable
wherefore
we
ask
leisure
and
space
to
have
deliberation
in
this
case
to
deem
for
the
common
proverb
saith
thus
that
soon
deemeth
soon
shall
repent
and
eke
men
say
that
that
judge
is
wise
that
soon
understandeth
a
matter
and
judgeth
by
leisure
for
albeit
so
that
all
tarrying
be
annoying
algates
nevertheless
it
is
no
reproof
subject
for
reproach
in
giving
of
judgement
nor
in
vengeance
taking
when
it
is
sufficient
and
reasonable
and
that
shewed
our
lord
jesus
christ
by
example
for
when
that
the
woman
that
was
taken
in
adultery
was
brought
in
his
presence
to
know
what
should
be
done
with
her
person
albeit
that
he
wist
well
himself
what
he
would
answer
yet
would
he
not
answer
suddenly
but
he
would
have
deliberation
and
in
the
ground
he
wrote
twice
and
by
these
causes
we
ask
deliberation
and
we
shall
then
by
the
grace
of
god
counsel
the
thing
that
shall
be
profitable
up
started
then
the
young
folk
anon
at
once
and
the
most
part
of
that
company
have
scorned
these
old
wise
men
and
begun
to
make
noise
and
said
right
as
while
that
iron
is
hot
men
should
smite
right
so
men
should
wreak
their
wrongs
while
that
they
be
fresh
and
new
and
with
loud
voice
they
cried
war
war
up
rose
then
one
of
these
old
wise
and
with
his
hand
made
countenance
a
sign
gesture
that
men
should
hold
them
still
and
give
him
audience
lordings
quoth
he
there
is
full
many
a
man
that
crieth
war
that
wot
full
little
what
war
amounteth
war
at
his
beginning
hath
so
great
an
entering
and
so
large
that
every
wight
may
enter
when
him
liketh
and
lightly
easily
find
war
but
certes
what
end
shall
fall
thereof
it
is
not
light
to
know
for
soothly
when
war
is
once
begun
there
is
full
many
a
child
unborn
of
his
mother
that
shall
sterve
die
young
by
cause
of
that
war
or
else
live
in
sorrow
and
die
in
wretchedness
and
therefore
ere
that
any
war
be
begun
men
must
have
great
counsel
and
great
deliberation
and
when
this
old
man
weened
thought
intended
to
enforce
his
tale
by
reasons
all
at
once
began
they
to
rise
for
to
break
his
tale
and
bid
him
full
oft
his
words
abridge
for
soothly
he
that
preacheth
to
them
that
list
not
hear
his
words
his
sermon
them
annoyeth
for
jesus
sirach
saith
that
music
in
weeping
is
a
noyous
troublesome
thing
this
is
to
say
as
much
availeth
to
speak
before
folk
to
whom
his
speech
annoyeth
as
to
sing
before
him
that
weepeth
and
when
this
wise
man
saw
that
him
wanted
audience
all
shamefast
he
sat
him
down
again
for
solomon
saith
as
thou
mayest
have
no
audience
enforce
thee
not
to
speak
i
see
well
quoth
this
wise
man
that
the
common
proverb
is
sooth
that
good
counsel
wanteth
when
it
is
most
need
yet
besides
further
had
this
meliboeus
in
his
council
many
folk
that
privily
in
his
ear
counselled
him
certain
thing
and
counselled
him
the
contrary
in
general
audience
when
meliboeus
had
heard
that
the
greatest
part
of
his
council
were
accorded
in
agreement
that
he
should
make
war
anon
he
consented
to
their
counselling
and
fully
affirmed
their
sentence
opinion
judgement
dame
prudence
seeing
her
husband
resolution
thus
taken
in
full
humble
wise
when
she
saw
her
time
begins
to
counsel
him
against
war
by
a
warning
against
haste
in
requital
of
either
good
or
evil
meliboeus
tells
her
that
he
will
not
work
by
her
counsel
because
he
should
be
held
a
fool
if
he
rejected
for
her
advice
the
opinion
of
so
many
wise
men
because
all
women
are
bad
because
it
would
seem
that
he
had
given
her
the
mastery
over
him
and
because
she
could
not
keep
his
secret
if
he
resolved
to
follow
her
advice
to
these
reasons
prudence
answers
that
it
is
no
folly
to
change
counsel
when
things
or
men
judgements
of
them
change
especially
to
alter
a
resolution
taken
on
the
impulse
of
a
great
multitude
of
folk
where
every
man
crieth
and
clattereth
what
him
liketh
that
if
all
women
had
been
wicked
jesus
christ
would
never
have
descended
to
be
born
of
a
woman
nor
have
showed
himself
first
to
a
woman
after
his
resurrection
and
that
when
solomon
said
he
had
found
no
good
woman
he
meant
that
god
alone
was
supremely
good
that
her
husband
would
not
seem
to
give
her
the
mastery
by
following
her
counsel
for
he
had
his
own
free
choice
in
following
or
rejecting
it
and
that
he
knew
well
and
had
often
tested
her
great
silence
patience
and
secrecy
and
whereas
he
had
quoted
a
saying
that
in
wicked
counsel
women
vanquish
men
she
reminds
him
that
she
would
counsel
him
against
doing
a
wickedness
on
which
he
had
set
his
mind
and
cites
instances
to
show
that
many
women
have
been
and
yet
are
full
good
and
their
counsel
wholesome
and
profitable
lastly
she
quotes
the
words
of
god
himself
when
he
was
about
to
make
woman
as
an
help
meet
for
man
and
promises
that
if
her
husband
will
trust
her
counsel
she
will
restore
to
him
his
daughter
whole
and
sound
and
make
him
have
honour
in
this
case
meliboeus
answers
that
because
of
his
wife
sweet
words
and
also
because
he
has
proved
and
assayed
her
great
wisdom
and
her
great
truth
he
will
govern
him
by
her
counsel
in
all
things
thus
encouraged
prudence
enters
on
a
long
discourse
full
of
learned
citations
regarding
the
manner
in
which
counsellors
should
be
chosen
and
consulted
and
the
times
and
reasons
for
changing
a
counsel
first
god
must
be
besought
for
guidance
then
a
man
must
well
examine
his
own
thoughts
of
such
things
as
he
holds
to
be
best
for
his
own
profit
driving
out
of
his
heart
anger
covetousness
and
hastiness
which
perturb
and
pervert
the
judgement
then
he
must
keep
his
counsel
secret
unless
confiding
it
to
another
shall
be
more
profitable
but
in
so
confiding
it
he
shall
say
nothing
to
bias
the
mind
of
the
counsellor
toward
flattery
or
subserviency
after
that
he
should
consider
his
friends
and
his
enemies
choosing
of
the
former
such
as
be
most
faithful
and
wise
and
eldest
and
most
approved
in
counselling
and
even
of
these
only
a
few
then
he
must
eschew
the
counselling
of
fools
of
flatterers
of
his
old
enemies
that
be
reconciled
of
servants
who
bear
him
great
reverence
and
fear
of
folk
that
be
drunken
and
can
hide
no
counsel
of
such
as
counsel
one
thing
privily
and
the
contrary
openly
and
of
young
folk
for
their
counselling
is
not
ripe
then
in
examining
his
counsel
he
must
truly
tell
his
tale
he
must
consider
whether
the
thing
he
proposes
to
do
be
reasonable
within
his
power
and
acceptable
to
the
more
part
and
the
better
part
of
his
counsellors
he
must
look
at
the
things
that
may
follow
from
that
counselling
choosing
the
best
and
waiving
all
besides
he
must
consider
the
root
whence
the
matter
of
his
counsel
is
engendered
what
fruits
it
may
bear
and
from
what
causes
they
be
sprung
and
having
thus
examined
his
counsel
and
approved
it
by
many
wise
folk
and
old
he
shall
consider
if
he
may
perform
it
and
make
of
it
a
good
end
if
he
be
in
doubt
he
shall
choose
rather
to
suffer
than
to
begin
but
otherwise
he
shall
prosecute
his
resolution
steadfastly
till
the
enterprise
be
at
an
end
as
to
changing
his
counsel
a
man
may
do
so
without
reproach
if
the
cause
cease
or
when
a
new
case
betides
or
if
he
find
that
by
error
or
otherwise
harm
or
damage
may
result
or
if
his
counsel
be
dishonest
or
come
of
dishonest
cause
or
if
it
be
impossible
or
may
not
properly
be
kept
and
he
must
take
it
for
a
general
rule
that
every
counsel
which
is
affirmed
so
strongly
that
it
may
not
be
changed
for
any
condition
that
may
betide
that
counsel
is
wicked
meliboeus
admitting
that
his
wife
had
spoken
well
and
suitably
as
to
counsellors
and
counsel
in
general
prays
her
to
tell
him
in
especial
what
she
thinks
of
the
counsellors
whom
they
have
chosen
in
their
present
need
prudence
replies
that
his
counsel
in
this
case
could
not
properly
be
called
a
counselling
but
a
movement
of
folly
and
points
out
that
he
has
erred
in
sundry
wise
against
the
rules
which
he
had
just
laid
down
granting
that
he
has
erred
meliboeus
says
that
he
is
all
ready
to
change
his
counsel
right
as
she
will
devise
for
as
the
proverb
runs
to
do
sin
is
human
but
to
persevere
long
in
sin
is
work
of
the
devil
prudence
then
minutely
recites
analyses
and
criticises
the
counsel
given
to
her
husband
in
the
assembly
of
his
friends
she
commends
the
advice
of
the
physicians
and
surgeons
and
urges
that
they
should
be
well
rewarded
for
their
noble
speech
and
their
services
in
healing
sophia
and
she
asks
meliboeus
how
he
understands
their
proposition
that
one
contrary
must
be
cured
by
another
contrary
meliboeus
answers
that
he
should
do
vengeance
on
his
enemies
who
had
done
him
wrong
prudence
however
insists
that
vengeance
is
not
the
contrary
of
vengeance
nor
wrong
of
wrong
but
the
like
and
that
wickedness
should
be
healed
by
goodness
discord
by
accord
war
by
peace
she
proceeds
to
deal
with
the
counsel
of
the
lawyers
and
wise
folk
that
advised
meliboeus
to
take
prudent
measures
for
the
security
of
his
body
and
of
his
house
first
she
would
have
her
husband
pray
for
the
protection
and
aid
of
christ
then
commit
the
keeping
of
his
person
to
his
true
friends
then
suspect
and
avoid
all
strange
folk
and
liars
and
such
people
as
she
had
already
warned
him
against
then
beware
of
presuming
on
his
strength
or
the
weakness
of
his
adversary
and
neglecting
to
guard
his
person
for
every
wise
man
dreadeth
his
enemy
then
he
should
evermore
be
on
the
watch
against
ambush
and
all
espial
even
in
what
seems
a
place
of
safety
though
he
should
not
be
so
cowardly
as
to
fear
where
is
no
cause
for
dread
yet
he
should
dread
to
be
poisoned
and
therefore
shun
scorners
and
fly
their
words
as
venom
as
to
the
fortification
of
his
house
she
points
out
that
towers
and
great
edifices
are
costly
and
laborious
yet
useless
unless
defended
by
true
friends
that
be
old
and
wise
and
the
greatest
and
strongest
garrison
that
a
rich
man
may
have
as
well
to
keep
his
person
as
his
goods
is
that
he
be
beloved
by
his
subjects
and
by
his
neighbours
warmly
approving
the
counsel
that
in
all
this
business
meliboeus
should
proceed
with
great
diligence
and
deliberation
prudence
goes
on
to
examine
the
advice
given
by
his
neighbours
that
do
him
reverence
without
love
his
old
enemies
reconciled
his
flatterers
that
counselled
him
certain
things
privily
and
openly
counselled
him
the
contrary
and
the
young
folk
that
counselled
him
to
avenge
himself
and
make
war
at
once
she
reminds
him
that
he
stands
alone
against
three
powerful
enemies
whose
kindred
are
numerous
and
close
while
his
are
fewer
and
remote
in
relationship
that
only
the
judge
who
has
jurisdiction
in
a
case
may
take
sudden
vengeance
on
any
man
that
her
husband
power
does
not
accord
with
his
desire
and
that
if
he
did
take
vengeance
it
would
only
breed
fresh
wrongs
and
contests
as
to
the
causes
of
the
wrong
done
to
him
she
holds
that
god
the
causer
of
all
things
has
permitted
him
to
suffer
because
he
has
drunk
so
much
honey
of
sweet
temporal
riches
and
delights
and
honours
of
this
world
that
he
is
drunken
and
has
forgotten
jesus
christ
his
saviour
the
three
enemies
of
mankind
the
flesh
the
fiend
and
the
world
have
entered
his
heart
by
the
windows
of
his
body
and
wounded
his
soul
in
five
places
that
is
to
say
the
deadly
sins
that
have
entered
into
his
heart
by
the
five
senses
and
in
the
same
manner
christ
has
suffered
his
three
enemies
to
enter
his
house
by
the
windows
and
wound
his
daughter
in
the
five
places
before
specified
meliboeus
demurs
that
if
his
objections
prevailed
vengeance
would
never
be
taken
and
thence
great
mischiefs
would
arise
but
prudence
replies
that
the
taking
of
vengeance
lies
with
the
judges
to
whom
the
private
individual
must
have
recourse
meliboeus
declares
that
such
vengeance
does
not
please
him
and
that
as
fortune
has
nourished
and
helped
him
from
his
childhood
he
will
now
assay
her
trusting
with
god
help
that
she
will
aid
him
to
avenge
his
shame
prudence
warns
him
against
trusting
to
fortune
all
the
less
because
she
has
hitherto
favoured
him
for
just
on
that
account
she
is
the
more
likely
to
fail
him
and
she
calls
on
him
to
leave
his
vengeance
with
the
sovereign
judge
that
avengeth
all
villainies
and
wrongs
meliboeus
argues
that
if
he
refrains
from
taking
vengeance
he
will
invite
his
enemies
to
do
him
further
wrong
and
he
will
be
put
and
held
over
low
but
prudence
contends
that
such
a
result
can
be
brought
about
only
by
the
neglect
of
the
judges
not
by
the
patience
of
the
individual
supposing
that
he
had
leave
to
avenge
himself
she
repeats
that
he
is
not
strong
enough
and
quotes
the
common
saw
that
it
is
madness
for
a
man
to
strive
with
a
stronger
than
himself
peril
to
strive
with
one
of
equal
strength
and
folly
to
strive
with
a
weaker
but
considering
his
own
defaults
and
demerits
remembering
the
patience
of
christ
and
the
undeserved
tribulations
of
the
saints
the
brevity
of
this
life
with
all
its
trouble
and
sorrow
the
discredit
thrown
on
the
wisdom
and
training
of
a
man
who
can
not
bear
wrong
with
patience
he
should
refrain
wholly
from
taking
vengeance
meliboeus
submits
that
he
is
not
at
all
a
perfect
man
and
his
heart
will
never
be
at
peace
until
he
is
avenged
and
that
as
his
enemies
disregarded
the
peril
when
they
attacked
him
so
he
might
without
reproach
incur
some
peril
in
attacking
them
in
return
even
though
he
did
a
great
excess
in
avenging
one
wrong
by
another
prudence
strongly
deprecates
all
outrage
or
excess
but
meliboeus
insists
that
he
can
not
see
that
it
might
greatly
harm
him
though
he
took
a
vengeance
for
he
is
richer
and
mightier
than
his
enemies
and
all
things
obey
money
prudence
thereupon
launches
into
a
long
dissertation
on
the
advantages
of
riches
the
evils
of
poverty
the
means
by
which
wealth
should
be
gathered
and
the
manner
in
which
it
should
be
used
and
concludes
by
counselling
her
husband
not
to
move
war
and
battle
through
trust
in
his
riches
for
they
suffice
not
to
maintain
war
the
battle
is
not
always
to
the
strong
or
the
numerous
and
the
perils
of
conflict
are
many
meliboeus
then
curtly
asks
her
for
her
counsel
how
he
shall
do
in
this
need
and
she
answers
that
certainly
she
counsels
him
to
agree
with
his
adversaries
and
have
peace
with
them
meliboeus
on
this
cries
out
that
plainly
she
loves
not
his
honour
or
his
worship
in
counselling
him
to
go
and
humble
himself
before
his
enemies
crying
mercy
to
them
that
having
done
him
so
grievous
wrong
ask
him
not
to
be
reconciled
then
prudence
making
semblance
of
wrath
retorts
that
she
loves
his
honour
and
profit
as
she
loves
her
own
and
ever
has
done
she
cites
the
scriptures
in
support
of
her
counsel
to
seek
peace
and
says
she
will
leave
him
to
his
own
courses
for
she
knows
well
he
is
so
stubborn
that
he
will
do
nothing
for
her
meliboeus
then
relents
admits
that
he
is
angry
and
can
not
judge
aright
and
puts
himself
wholly
in
her
hands
promising
to
do
just
as
she
desires
and
admitting
that
he
is
the
more
held
to
love
and
praise
her
if
she
reproves
him
of
his
folly
then
dame
prudence
discovered
all
her
counsel
and
her
will
unto
him
and
said
i
counsel
you
quoth
she
above
all
things
that
ye
make
peace
between
god
and
you
and
be
reconciled
unto
him
and
to
his
grace
for
as
i
have
said
to
you
herebefore
god
hath
suffered
you
to
have
this
tribulation
and
disease
distress
trouble
for
your
sins
and
if
ye
do
as
i
say
you
god
will
send
your
adversaries
unto
you
and
make
them
fall
at
your
feet
ready
to
do
your
will
and
your
commandment
for
solomon
saith
the
condition
of
man
is
pleasant
and
liking
to
god
he
changeth
the
hearts
of
the
man
adversaries
and
constraineth
them
to
beseech
him
of
peace
of
grace
and
i
pray
you
let
me
speak
with
your
adversaries
in
privy
place
for
they
shall
not
know
it
is
by
your
will
or
your
assent
and
then
when
i
know
their
will
and
their
intent
i
may
counsel
you
the
more
surely
dame
quoth
meliboeus
do
your
will
and
your
liking
for
i
put
me
wholly
in
your
disposition
and
ordinance
then
dame
prudence
when
she
saw
the
goodwill
of
her
husband
deliberated
and
took
advice
in
herself
thinking
how
she
might
bring
this
need
affair
emergency
unto
a
good
end
and
when
she
saw
her
time
she
sent
for
these
adversaries
to
come
into
her
into
a
privy
place
and
showed
wisely
into
them
the
great
goods
that
come
of
peace
and
the
great
harms
and
perils
that
be
in
war
and
said
to
them
in
goodly
manner
how
that
they
ought
have
great
repentance
of
the
injuries
and
wrongs
that
they
had
done
to
meliboeus
her
lord
and
unto
her
and
her
daughter
and
when
they
heard
the
goodly
words
of
dame
prudence
then
they
were
surprised
and
ravished
and
had
so
great
joy
of
her
that
wonder
was
to
tell
ah
lady
quoth
they
ye
have
showed
unto
us
the
blessing
of
sweetness
after
the
saying
of
david
the
prophet
for
the
reconciling
which
we
be
not
worthy
to
have
in
no
manner
but
we
ought
require
it
with
great
contrition
and
humility
ye
of
your
great
goodness
have
presented
unto
us
now
see
we
well
that
the
science
and
conning
knowledge
of
solomon
is
full
true
for
he
saith
that
sweet
words
multiply
and
increase
friends
and
make
shrews
the
or
angry
to
be
debonair
gentle
courteous
and
meek
certes
we
put
our
deed
and
all
our
matter
and
cause
all
wholly
in
your
goodwill
and
be
ready
to
obey
unto
the
speech
and
commandment
of
my
lord
meliboeus
and
therefore
dear
and
benign
lady
we
pray
you
and
beseech
you
as
meekly
as
we
can
and
may
that
it
like
unto
your
great
goodness
to
fulfil
in
deed
your
goodly
words
for
we
consider
and
acknowledge
that
we
have
offended
and
grieved
my
lord
meliboeus
out
of
measure
so
far
forth
that
we
be
not
of
power
to
make
him
amends
and
therefore
we
oblige
and
bind
us
and
our
friends
to
do
all
his
will
and
his
commandment
but
peradventure
he
hath
such
heaviness
and
such
wrath
to
usward
towards
us
because
of
our
offence
that
he
will
enjoin
us
such
a
pain
penalty
as
we
may
not
bear
nor
sustain
and
therefore
noble
lady
we
beseech
to
your
womanly
pity
to
take
such
advisement
consideration
in
this
need
that
we
nor
our
friends
be
not
disinherited
and
destroyed
through
our
folly
certes
quoth
prudence
it
is
an
hard
thing
and
right
perilous
that
a
man
put
him
all
utterly
in
the
arbitration
and
judgement
and
in
the
might
and
power
of
his
enemy
for
solomon
saith
me
and
give
credence
to
that
that
i
shall
say
to
thy
son
to
thy
wife
to
thy
friend
nor
to
thy
brother
give
thou
never
might
nor
mastery
over
thy
body
while
thou
livest
now
since
he
defendeth
forbiddeth
that
a
man
should
not
give
to
his
brother
nor
to
his
friend
the
might
of
his
body
by
a
stronger
reason
he
defendeth
and
forbiddeth
a
man
to
give
himself
to
his
enemy
and
nevertheless
i
counsel
you
that
ye
mistrust
not
my
lord
for
i
wot
well
and
know
verily
that
he
is
debonair
and
meek
large
courteous
and
nothing
desirous
nor
envious
of
good
nor
riches
for
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
that
he
desireth
save
only
worship
and
honour
furthermore
i
know
well
and
am
right
sure
that
he
shall
nothing
do
in
this
need
without
counsel
of
me
and
i
shall
so
work
in
this
case
that
by
the
grace
of
our
lord
god
ye
shall
be
reconciled
unto
us
then
said
they
with
one
voice
worshipful
lady
we
put
us
and
our
goods
all
fully
in
your
will
and
disposition
and
be
ready
to
come
what
day
that
it
like
unto
your
nobleness
to
limit
us
or
assign
us
for
to
make
our
obligation
and
bond
as
strong
as
it
liketh
unto
your
goodness
that
we
may
fulfil
the
will
of
you
and
of
my
lord
meliboeus
when
dame
prudence
had
heard
the
answer
of
these
men
she
bade
them
go
again
privily
and
she
returned
to
her
lord
meliboeus
and
told
him
how
she
found
his
adversaries
full
repentant
acknowledging
full
lowly
their
sins
and
trespasses
and
how
they
were
ready
to
suffer
all
pain
requiring
and
praying
him
of
mercy
and
pity
then
said
meliboeus
he
is
well
worthy
to
have
pardon
and
forgiveness
of
his
sin
that
excuseth
not
his
sin
but
acknowledgeth
and
repenteth
him
asking
indulgence
for
seneca
saith
is
the
remission
and
forgiveness
where
the
confession
is
for
confession
is
neighbour
to
innocence
and
therefore
i
assent
and
confirm
me
to
have
peace
but
it
is
good
that
we
do
naught
without
the
assent
and
will
of
our
friends
then
was
prudence
right
glad
and
joyful
and
said
certes
sir
ye
be
well
and
goodly
advised
for
right
as
by
the
counsel
assent
and
help
of
your
friends
ye
have
been
stirred
to
avenge
you
and
make
war
right
so
without
their
counsel
shall
ye
not
accord
you
nor
have
peace
with
your
adversaries
for
the
law
saith
is
nothing
so
good
by
way
of
kind
nature
as
a
thing
to
be
unbound
by
him
that
it
was
bound
and
then
dame
prudence
without
delay
or
tarrying
sent
anon
her
messengers
for
their
kin
and
for
their
old
friends
which
were
true
and
wise
and
told
them
by
order
in
the
presence
of
meliboeus
all
this
matter
as
it
is
above
expressed
and
declared
and
prayed
them
that
they
would
give
their
advice
and
counsel
what
were
best
to
do
in
this
need
and
when
meliboeus
friends
had
taken
their
advice
and
deliberation
of
the
foresaid
matter
and
had
examined
it
by
great
business
and
great
diligence
they
gave
full
counsel
for
to
have
peace
and
rest
and
that
meliboeus
should
with
good
heart
receive
his
adversaries
to
forgiveness
and
mercy
and
when
dame
prudence
had
heard
the
assent
of
her
lord
meliboeus
and
the
counsel
of
his
friends
accord
with
her
will
and
her
intention
she
was
wondrous
glad
in
her
heart
and
said
there
is
an
old
proverb
that
saith
goodness
that
thou
mayest
do
this
day
do
it
and
abide
not
nor
delay
it
not
till
and
therefore
i
counsel
you
that
ye
send
your
messengers
such
as
be
discreet
and
wise
unto
your
adversaries
telling
them
on
your
behalf
that
if
they
will
treat
of
peace
and
of
accord
that
they
shape
prepare
them
without
delay
or
tarrying
to
come
unto
us
which
thing
performed
was
indeed
and
when
these
trespassers
and
repenting
folk
of
their
follies
that
is
to
say
the
adversaries
of
meliboeus
had
heard
what
these
messengers
said
unto
them
they
were
right
glad
and
joyful
and
answered
full
meekly
and
benignly
yielding
graces
and
thanks
to
their
lord
meliboeus
and
to
all
his
company
and
shaped
them
without
delay
to
go
with
the
messengers
and
obey
to
the
commandment
of
their
lord
meliboeus
and
right
anon
they
took
their
way
to
the
court
of
meliboeus
and
took
with
them
some
of
their
true
friends
to
make
faith
for
them
and
for
to
be
their
borrows
sureties
and
when
they
were
come
to
the
presence
of
meliboeus
he
said
to
them
these
words
it
stands
thus
quoth
meliboeus
and
sooth
it
is
that
ye
causeless
and
without
skill
and
reason
have
done
great
injuries
and
wrongs
to
me
and
to
my
wife
prudence
and
to
my
daughter
also
for
ye
have
entered
into
my
house
by
violence
and
have
done
such
outrage
that
all
men
know
well
that
ye
have
deserved
the
death
and
therefore
will
i
know
and
weet
of
you
whether
ye
will
put
the
punishing
and
chastising
and
the
vengeance
of
this
outrage
in
the
will
of
me
and
of
my
wife
or
ye
will
not
then
the
wisest
of
them
three
answered
for
them
all
and
said
sir
quoth
he
we
know
well
that
we
be
i
unworthy
to
come
to
the
court
of
so
great
a
lord
and
so
worthy
as
ye
be
for
we
have
so
greatly
mistaken
us
and
have
offended
and
aguilt
incurred
guilt
in
such
wise
against
your
high
lordship
that
truly
we
have
deserved
the
death
but
yet
for
the
great
goodness
and
debonairte
courtesy
gentleness
that
all
the
world
witnesseth
of
your
person
we
submit
us
to
the
excellence
and
benignity
of
your
gracious
lordship
and
be
ready
to
obey
to
all
your
commandments
beseeching
you
that
of
your
merciable
merciful
pity
ye
will
consider
our
great
repentance
and
low
submission
and
grant
us
forgiveness
of
our
outrageous
trespass
and
offence
for
well
we
know
that
your
liberal
grace
and
mercy
stretch
them
farther
into
goodness
than
do
our
outrageous
guilt
and
trespass
into
wickedness
albeit
that
cursedly
wickedly
and
damnably
we
have
aguilt
incurred
guilt
against
your
high
lordship
then
meliboeus
took
them
up
from
the
ground
full
benignly
and
received
their
obligations
and
their
bonds
by
their
oaths
upon
their
pledges
and
borrows
sureties
and
assigned
them
a
certain
day
to
return
unto
his
court
for
to
receive
and
accept
sentence
and
judgement
that
meliboeus
would
command
to
be
done
on
them
by
the
causes
aforesaid
which
things
ordained
every
man
returned
home
to
his
house
and
when
that
dame
prudence
saw
her
time
she
freined
inquired
and
asked
her
lord
meliboeus
what
vengeance
he
thought
to
take
of
his
adversaries
to
which
meliboeus
answered
and
said
certes
quoth
he
i
think
and
purpose
me
fully
to
disinherit
them
of
all
that
ever
they
have
and
for
to
put
them
in
exile
for
evermore
certes
quoth
dame
prudence
this
were
a
cruel
sentence
and
much
against
reason
for
ye
be
rich
enough
and
have
no
need
of
other
men
goods
and
ye
might
lightly
easily
in
this
wise
get
you
a
covetous
name
which
is
a
vicious
thing
and
ought
to
be
eschewed
of
every
good
man
for
after
the
saying
of
the
apostle
covetousness
is
root
of
all
harms
and
therefore
it
were
better
for
you
to
lose
much
good
of
your
own
than
for
to
take
of
their
good
in
this
manner
for
better
it
is
to
lose
good
with
worship
honour
than
to
win
good
with
villainy
and
shame
and
every
man
ought
to
do
his
diligence
and
his
business
to
get
him
a
good
name
and
yet
further
shall
he
not
only
busy
him
in
keeping
his
good
name
but
he
shall
also
enforce
him
alway
to
do
some
thing
by
which
he
may
renew
his
good
name
for
it
is
written
that
the
old
good
los
reputation
of
a
man
is
soon
gone
and
passed
when
it
is
not
renewed
and
as
touching
that
ye
say
that
ye
will
exile
your
adversaries
that
thinketh
ye
much
against
reason
and
out
of
measure
moderation
considered
the
power
that
they
have
given
you
upon
themselves
and
it
is
written
that
he
is
worthy
to
lose
his
privilege
that
misuseth
the
might
and
the
power
that
is
given
him
and
i
set
case
if
i
assume
ye
might
enjoin
them
that
pain
by
right
and
by
law
which
i
trow
ye
may
not
do
i
say
ye
might
not
put
it
to
execution
peradventure
and
then
it
were
like
to
return
to
the
war
as
it
was
before
and
therefore
if
ye
will
that
men
do
you
obeisance
ye
must
deem
decide
more
courteously
that
is
to
say
ye
must
give
more
easy
sentences
and
judgements
for
it
is
written
that
most
courteously
commandeth
to
him
men
most
obey
and
therefore
i
pray
you
that
in
this
necessity
and
in
this
need
ye
cast
you
endeavour
devise
a
way
to
overcome
your
heart
for
seneca
saith
that
he
that
overcometh
his
heart
overcometh
twice
and
tullius
saith
is
nothing
so
commendable
in
a
great
lord
as
when
he
is
debonair
and
meek
and
appeaseth
him
lightly
easily
and
i
pray
you
that
ye
will
now
forbear
to
do
vengeance
in
such
a
manner
that
your
good
name
may
be
kept
and
conserved
and
that
men
may
have
cause
and
matter
to
praise
you
of
pity
and
of
mercy
and
that
ye
have
no
cause
to
repent
you
of
thing
that
ye
do
for
seneca
saith
overcometh
in
an
evil
manner
that
repenteth
him
of
his
victory
wherefore
i
pray
you
let
mercy
be
in
your
heart
to
the
effect
and
intent
that
god
almighty
have
mercy
upon
you
in
his
last
judgement
for
saint
james
saith
in
his
epistle
without
mercy
shall
be
done
to
him
that
hath
no
mercy
of
another
wight
when
meliboeus
had
heard
the
great
skills
arguments
reasons
and
reasons
of
dame
prudence
and
her
wise
information
and
teaching
his
heart
gan
incline
to
the
will
of
his
wife
considering
her
true
intent
he
conformed
him
anon
and
assented
fully
to
work
after
her
counsel
and
thanked
god
of
whom
proceedeth
all
goodness
and
all
virtue
that
him
sent
a
wife
of
so
great
discretion
and
when
the
day
came
that
his
adversaries
should
appear
in
his
presence
he
spake
to
them
full
goodly
and
said
in
this
wise
albeit
so
that
of
your
pride
and
high
presumption
and
folly
an
of
your
negligence
and
unconning
ignorance
ye
have
misborne
misbehaved
you
and
trespassed
done
injury
unto
me
yet
forasmuch
as
i
see
and
behold
your
great
humility
and
that
ye
be
sorry
and
repentant
of
your
guilts
it
constraineth
me
to
do
you
grace
and
mercy
wherefore
i
receive
you
into
my
grace
and
forgive
you
utterly
all
the
offences
injuries
and
wrongs
that
ye
have
done
against
me
and
mine
to
this
effect
and
to
this
end
that
god
of
his
endless
mercy
will
at
the
time
of
our
dying
forgive
us
our
guilts
that
we
have
trespassed
to
him
in
this
wretched
world
for
doubtless
if
we
be
sorry
and
repentant
of
the
sins
and
guilts
which
we
have
trespassed
in
the
sight
of
our
lord
god
he
is
so
free
and
so
merciable
merciful
that
he
will
forgive
us
our
guilts
and
bring
us
to
the
bliss
that
never

notes
to
chaucer
tale
of
meliboeus
the
tale
of
meliboeus
is
literally
translated
from
a
french
story
or
rather
treatise
in
prose
entitled
le
livre
de
melibee
et
de
dame
prudence
of
which
two
manuscripts
both
dating
from
the
fifteenth
century
are
preserved
in
the
british
museum
tyrwhitt
justly
enough
says
of
it
that
it
is
indeed
as
chaucer
called
it
in
the
prologue
moral
tale
virtuous
and
was
probably
much
esteemed
in
its
time
but
in
this
age
of
levity
i
doubt
some
readers
will
be
apt
to
regret
that
he
did
not
rather
give
us
the
remainder
of
sir
thopas
it
has
been
remarked
that
in
the
earlier
portion
of
the
tale
as
it
left
the
hand
of
the
poet
a
number
of
blank
verses
were
intermixed
though
this
peculiarity
of
style
noticeable
in
any
case
only
in
the
first
or
lines
has
necessarily
all
but
disappeared
by
the
changes
of
spelling
made
in
the
modern
editions
the
editor
purpose
being
to
present
to
the
public
not
the
canterbury
tales
merely
but
the
poems
of
chaucer
so
far
as
may
be
consistent
with
the
limits
of
this
volume
he
has
condensed
the
long
reasonings
and
learned
quotations
of
dame
prudence
into
a
mere
outline
connecting
those
portions
of
the
tale
wherein
lies
so
much
of
story
as
it
actually
possesses
and
the
general
reader
will
probably
not
regret
the
sacrifice
made
in
the
view
of
retaining
so
far
as
possible
the
completeness
of
the
tales
while
lessening
the
intrusion
of
prose
into
a
volume
or
poems
the
good
wife
of
meliboeus
literally
overflows
with
quotations
from
david
solomon

of

cassiodorus
cato
petrus

and
other
authorities
and
in
some
passages
especially
where
husband
and
wife
debate
the
merits
or
demerits
of
women
and
where
prudence
dilates
on
the
evils
of
poverty
chaucer
only
reproduces
much
that
had
been
said
already
in
the
tales
that
preceded
such
as
the
merchant
and
the
man
of
law
the
lines
which
follow
are
a
close
translation
of

i
will
tell
of

as
olde

maken
us
memory
of
him
that
stood
in
great
prosperity
and
is
out
of
high
degree
in
misery
and
endeth
wretchedly
and
they
be
versified
commonly
of
six
feet
which
men
call
hexametron
in

be
indited
many
a

in

this
declaring
ought
enough
suffice
now
hearken
if
ye
like
for
to
hear
but
first
i
you
beseech
in
this
mattere
though
i
by
order
telle
not
these
things
be
it
of
popes
emperors
or
kings
their
ages
as
men
written
find
chronological
but
tell
them
some
before
and
some
behind
as
it
now
cometh
to
my
remembrance
have
me
excused
of
mine
ignorance
notes
to
the
prologue
to
the
monk
tale
the
corpus
madrian
the
body
of
maternus
of
treves
that
her
misdoth
or
saith
that
does
or
says
any
thing
to
offend
her
cope
an
ecclesiastcal
vestment
covering
all
the
body
like
a
cloak
though
he
were
shorn
full
high
upon
his
pan
though
he
were
tonsured
as
the
clergy
are
imps
shoots
branches
from
impian
german
impfen
to
implant
ingraft
the
word
is
now
used
in
a
very
restricted
sense
to
signify
the
progeny
children
of
the
devil
lusheburghes
base
or
counterfeit
coins
so
called
because
struck
at
luxemburg
a
great
importation
of
them
took
place
during
the
reigns
of
the
earlier
edwards
and
they
caused
much
annoyance
and
complaint
till
in
it
was
declared
treason
to
bring
them
into
the
country
the
tale
i
will
bewail
in
manner
of
tragedy
the
harm
of
them
that
stood
in
high
degree
and
felle
so
that
there
was
no
remedy
to
bring
them
out
of
their
adversity
for
certain
when
that
fortune
list
to
flee
there
may
no
man
the
course
of
her
wheel
hold
let
no
man
trust
in
blind
prosperity
beware
by
these
examples
true
and
old
at
lucifer
though
he
an
angel
were
and
not
a
man
at
him
i
will
begin
for
though
fortune
may
no

from
high
degree
yet
fell
he
for
his
sin
down
into
hell
where
as

to
pray
to

he
drank
enough
shortly
to
say
thus

tell
by
very
force
at

on
a
night
the
philistines
of

of
the
gates
of

hath
up
plight
wrenched
and
on

hath
he
high
on

of
the

falsely
to
his
foemen
she
him
sold
and
sleeping
in
her
upon
a
day
she
made
to
clip
or
shear
his
hair
away
and
made
his
foemen
all
his
craft
espien
and
when
they
founde
him
in
this
array
they
bound
him
fast
and
put
out
both
his
eyen
but
ere
his
hair
was
clipped
or
there
was
no
bond
with
which
men
might
him
bind
but
now
is
he
in

in
a
cave
where
as
they
made
him
at
the

o
whilom
judge
in

in
a
temple
of

mighte
him
not
bereave
of

but
suddenly
he
lost
his
dignity
and
like
a
beast
he
seemed
for
to
be
and
ate
hay
as
an
ox
and
lay
thereout
in
rain
with
wilde
beastes
walked
he
till
certain
time
was
about
and
like
an
eagle
feathers
wax
his
hairs
his
nailes
like
a
birde
clawes
were
till
god
released
him
at
certain
years
and
gave
him
wit
and
then
with
many
a
tear
he
thanked
god
and
ever
his
life
in
fear
was
he
to
do
amiss
or
more
trespace
and
till
that
time
he
laid
was
on
his

he
knew
that
god
was
full
of
might
and
grace
his
sone
which
that
highte
balthasar
that
the
after
his
father
day
the
he
by
his

coulde
not
beware
for
proud
he
was
of
heart
and
of
array
and
eke
an
idolaster
was
he
aye
his
high
estate
him
in
pride
but
fortune
cast
him
down
and
there
he
lay
and
suddenly
his

gan
divide
a

he
made
unto
his

all
upon
a
time
and
made

cast
and
saw
an
hand
armless
that
wrote
full
fast
for
fear
of

he
quaked
and
sighed
sore
this
hand
that
balthasar
so
sore
aghast
wrote

phares
and
no
more
in
all
that
land
magician
was
there
none
that
could
expounde
what
this
letter
meant
but
daniel
expounded
it
anon
and
said
o

lent
glory
and
honour
regne
treasure
rent
and
he

dry
till
that
he
knew
by
grace
and
by
reason
that
god
of
heaven
hath
domination

every

and
then
had
god
of
him
compassion
and
him
restor
his

eke
thou
that

he
thereto
had
neither
right
nor

lordings
example
hereby
may
ye
take
how
that
in
lordship
is
no
sickerness
for
when
that
fortune
will
a
man
forsake
she
bears
away
his
regne
and
his

and
eke
his
friendes
bothe
more
and
less
for
what
man
that

friendes
through

mishap
will
make
them
enemies
i
guess
this
proverb
is
full
sooth
and
full
commune
zenobia
of
palmyrie
the
queen
as
write
persians
of
her
nobless
so
worthy
was
in
armes
and
so
keen
that
no
wight
passed
her
in
hardiness
nor
in
lineage
nor
other
gentleness
qualities
of
the
king
blood
of
is
she
descended
i
say
not
that
she
hadde
most
fairness
but
of
her
shape
she
might
not
he
amended
from
her
childhood
i
finde
that
she
fled
office
of
woman
and
to
woods
she
went
and
many
a
wilde
harte
blood
she
shed
with
arrows
broad
that
she
against
them
sent
she
was
so
swift
that
she
anon
them
hent
and
when
that
she
was
older
she
would
kill
lions
leopards
and
beares
all
to
pieces
and
in
her
armes
wield
them
at
her
will
she
durst
the
wilde
beastes
dennes
seek
and
runnen
in
the
mountains
all
the
night
and
sleep
under
a
bush
and
she
could
eke
wrestle
by
very
force
and
very
might
with
any
young
man
were
he
so
wight
nimble
there
mighte
nothing
in
her
armes
stond
she
kept
her
maidenhood
from
every
wight
to
no
man
deigned
she
for
to
be
bond
but
at
the
last
her
friendes
have
her
married
to
odenate
a
prince
of
that
country
all
were
it
so
that
she
them
longe
tarried
and
ye
shall
understande
how
that
he
hadde
such
fantasies
as
hadde
she
but
natheless
when
they
were
knit
in
fere
they
liv
in
joy
and
in
felicity
for
each
of
them
had
other
and
dear
save
one
thing
that
she
never
would
assent
by
no
way
that
he
shoulde
by
her
lie
but
ones
for
it
was
her
plain
intent
to
have
a
child
the
world
to
multiply
and
all
so
soon
as
that
she
might
espy
that
she
was
not
with
childe
by
that
deed
then
would
she
suffer
him
do
his
fantasy
eftsoon
and
not
but
ones
of
dread
and
if
she
were
with
child
at
cast
no
more
should
he
playe
thilke
game
till
fully
forty
dayes
were
past
then
would
she
once
suffer
him
do
the
same
were
this
odenatus
wild
or
tame
he
got
no
more
of
her
for
thus
she
said
it
was
to
wives
lechery
and
shame
in
other
if
that
men
with
them
play
on
other
terms
two
sones
by
this
odenate
had
she
the
which
she
kept
in
virtue
and
lettrure
but
now
unto
our
tale
turne
we
i
say
so
worshipful
a
creature
and
wise
therewith
and
with
measure
so
in
the
war
and
courteous
eke
nor
more
labour
might
in
war
endure
was
none
though
all
this
worlde
men
should
seek
her
rich
array
it
mighte
not
be
told
as
well
in
vessel
as
in
her
clothing
she
was
all
clad
in
and
in
gold
and
eke
she
not
for
no
hunting
not
to
have
of
sundry
tongues
full
knowing
when
that
she
leisure
had
and
for
to
learne
bookes
was
all
her
liking
how
she
in
virtue
might
her
life
dispend
and
shortly
of
this
story
for
to
treat
so
doughty
was
her
husband
and
eke
she
that
they
conquered
many
regnes
great
in
with
many
a
fair
city
appertinent
unto
the
majesty
of
rome
and
with
strong
hande
held
them
fast
nor
ever
might
their
foemen
them
flee
aye
while
that
odenatus
dayes
last
her
battles
whoso
list
them
for
to
read
against
sapor
the
king
and
other

and
how
that
all
this
process
fell
in
deed
why
she
conquer
and
what
title
thereto
and
after
of
her
and
her
woe
how
that
she
was
besieged
and
let
him
unto
my
master
petrarch
go
that
writes
enough
of
this
i
undertake
when
odenate
was
dead
she
mightily
the
regne
held
and
with
her
proper
hand
against
her
foes
she
fought
so
cruelly
that
there
king
nor
prince
in
all
that
land
not
that
was
not
glad
if
be
that
grace
fand
that
she
would
not

warray
war
with

they
maden
alliance
by

to

her
although
that
nero
were
so
vicious
as
any

that
lies
full

yet
he
as
telleth
us
suetonius
this

it
never

burnt
for

the

he
slew
upon

to
heare
how
that
men
would
weep
and

and
slew
his

and
by
his

lay
his

made
he
in

for
he
her
wombe
slitte

was
so
that

so
little
of

told
no
tear
out

for

came
but
he
said
a

great
wonder
is
how
that

deade
beauty
the
wine
to
bringe

commanded
he
and
drank
anon
none
other
woe
he
made
when

joined
unto
cruelty
alas
too
deepe
will
the
venom
wade
in

a

had
this
emperour
to
teache
him
and
courtesy
learning
for
of

he
was
the
as
in

bookes
lie
and
while
this

made
him
so
conning
and
so
souple
that
longe
time
it
was
ere
tyranny
or
any

durst
in

uncouple
let
loose
this
seneca
of
which
that
i
devise
because
nero
had
of
him
suche
dread
for
he
from
vices
would
him
aye
chastise
discreetly
as
by
word
and
not
by
deed
sir
he
would
say
an
emperor
must
need
be
virtuous
and
hate
tyranny
for
which
he
made
him
in
a
bath
to
bleed
on
both
his
armes
till
he
muste
die
this
nero
had
eke
of
a
in
youth
against
his
master
for
to
rise
in
his
presence
which
afterward
he
thought
a
great
grievance
therefore
he
made
him
dien
in
this
wise
but
natheless
this
seneca
the
wise
chose
in
a
bath
to
die
in
this
mannere
rather
than
have
another
tormentise
and
thus
hath
nero
slain
his
master
dear
now
fell
it
so
that
fortune
list
no
longer
the
highe
pride
of
nero
to

though
he
were
strong
yet

the
monk

is
founded
in
its
main
features
on
bocccacio
work
de
casibus
virorum
illustrium
stories
of
illustrious
men
but
chaucer
has
taken
the
separate
stories
of
which
it
is
composed
from
different
authors
and
dealt
with
them
after
his
own
fashion
boccaccio
opens
his
book
with
adam
whose
story
is
told
at
much
greater
length
than
here
lydgate
in
his
translation
from
boccaccio
speaks
of
adam
and
eve
as
made
of
slime
of
the
erth
in
damascene
the
felde
judges
xiii
boccaccio
also
tells
the
story
of
samson
but
chaucer
seems
by
his
quotation
a
few
lines
below
to
have
taken
his
version
direct
from
the
sacred
book
oliveres

the

are
not

these
known
as
the

the

and
the
capture
of

are
not
in
this
list
other
and
less
famous
deeds
of
the
hero
taking
their
place
for
this
however
we
must
accuse
not
chaucer
but
boethius
whom
he
has
almost
literally
translated
though
with
some
change
of
order
trophee
one
of
the
manuscripts
has
a
marginal
reference
to
tropheus
vates
chaldaeorum
tropheus
the
prophet
of
the
chaldees
but
it
is
not
known
what
author
chaucer
meant
unless
the
reference
is
to
a
passage
in
the
filostrato
of
boccaccio
on
which
chaucer
founded
his
troilus
and
cressida
and
which
lydgate
mentions
under
the
name
of
trophe
as
having
been
translated
by
chaucer
pres
near
french
pres
the
meaning
seems
to
be
this
nearer
lower
world
chaucer
has
taken
the
story
of
zenobia
from
work
de
claris
mulieribus
of
illustrious
women
odenatus
who
for
his
services
to
the
romans
received
from
gallienus
the
title
of
augustus
he
was
assassinated
in
not
it
was
believed
without
the
connivance
of
zenobia
who
succeeded
him
on
the
throne
sapor
was
king
of
persia
who
made
the
emperor
valerian
prisoner
conquered
syria
and
was
pressing
triumphantly
westward
when
he
was
met
and
defeated
by
odenatus
and
zenobia
aurelain
became
emperor
in
vitremite
the
signification
of
this
word
which
is
spelled
in
several
ways
is
not
known
skinner
explanation
another
attire
founded
on
the
spelling
autremite
is
obviously
insufficient
great
part
of
this
tragedy
of
nero
is
really
borrowed
however
from
the
romance
of
the
rose
trice
thrust
from
thriccan
so
in
the
man
of
law
tale
the
sultaness
promises
her
son
that
she
will
reny
her
lay
as
the
tragedy
of
holofernes
is
founded
on
the
book
of
judith
so
is
that
of
antiochus
on
the
second
book
of

before

apparently

corruption

the

at
the
opening
of
the
story
of

chaucer
has
copied
from
his
own
translation
of
boethius
but
the
story
is
mainly
taken
from
the
romance
of
the
rose
this
reflection
says
tyrwhttt
seems
to
have
been
suggested
by
one
which
follows
soon
after
the
mention
of
croesus
in
the
passage
just
cited
from
boethius
other
thing
bewail
the
cryings
of
tragedies
but
only
the
deeds
of
fortune
that
with
an
awkward
stroke
overturneth
the
realms
of
great
nobley
in
some
manuscripts
the
four
tragedies
that
follow
are
placed
between
those
of
zenobia
and
nero
but
although
the
general
reflection
with
which
the
tragedy
of
croesus
closes
might
most
appropriately
wind
up
the
whole
series
the
general
chronological
arrangement
which
is
observed
in
the
other
cases
recommends
the
order
followed
in
the
text
besides
since
like
several
other
tales
the
monk
tragedies
were
cut
short
by
the
impatience
of
the
auditors
it
is
more
natural
that
the
tale
should
close
abruptly
than
by
such
a
rhetorical
finish
as
these
lines
afford
pedro
the
cruel
king
of
aragon
against
whom
his
brother
henry
rebelled
he
was
by
false
pretences
inveigled
into
his
brother
tent
and
treacherously
slain
mr
wright
has
remarked
that
the
cause
of
pedro
though
he
was
no
better
than
a
cruel
and
reckless
tyrant
was
popular
in
england
from
the
very
circumstance
that
prince
edward
the
black
prince
had
embarked
in
it
not
the
oliver
of
charlemagne
but
a
traitorous
oliver
of
armorica
corrupted
by
a
bribe
ganilion
was
the
betrayer
of
the
christian
army
at
roncevalles
see
note
to
the
tale
and
his
name
appears
to
have
been
for
a
long
time
used
in
france
to
denote
a
traitor
duguesclin
who
betrayed
pedro
into
his
brother
tent
seems
to
be
intended
by
the
term
ganilion
oliver
but
if
so
chaucer
has
mistaken
his
name
which
was
bertrand
perhaps
confounding
him
as
tyrwhttt
suggests
with
oliver
du
clisson
another
illustrious
breton
of
those
times
who
was
also
constable
of
france
after
duguesclin
the
arms
of
the
latter
are
supposed
to
be
described

and
died

historical
fact
mentioned
in

thus
it
throws
the
date
of
their
composition

about

quoth

good
sir
no

of

and
muche
more
for

is
right
enough
to
muche
folk
i
guess
i

for
me
it
is
a
great
disease
of
distress
annoyance
where
as
men
have
been
in
great
wealth
and
ease
to
hearen
of
their
sudden

and
the
contrary
is
joy
and
great

as
when
a
man
hath
been
in
poor
estate
and
climbeth
up
and
waxeth
fortunate
and
there
abideth
in
prosperity
such
thing
is
gladsome
as
it
thinketh
me
and
of
such
thing
were
goodly
for
to
tell
yea
quoth
our
hoste
by

ye
say
right
sooth
this

hath
loud
he
spake
how
fortune
cover
with

i
wot
not
what
and
als
of
a
tragedy
right
now
ye
heard
and
pardie
no
remedy
it
is
for
to
bewaile
nor
complain
that
that
is
done
and
also
it
is
pain
as
ye
have
said
to
hear
of
heaviness
sir
monk
no
more
of
this
so
god
you
bless
your
tale
annoyeth
all
this
company
such
talking
is
not
worth
a

for
therein
is
there
no
sport
nor

therefore
sir
monke
dan
piers
by
your

i
pray
you
tell
us
somewhat
else
for
sickerly
clinking
of

it
not
for
the
that
on

hang
on

king
that

i
should
ere
this
have

although
the
slough
had
been
never
so
deep
then
had
your
tale
been
all
told
in

john
notes
to
the
prologue
to
the

priest
tale

justified
by
the
description
of

in
the
prologue
as
an
that
loved
venery
on
this
tyrwhitt
remarks
i
know
not
how
it
has
happened
that
in
the
principal
modern
languages
john
or
its
equivalent
is
a
name
of
contempt
or
at
least
of
slight
so
the
italians
use
from
whence
the
spaniards
as
juan
a
foolish
john
the

various
additions
and
in
english
when
we
call
a
man
john
we
do
not
mean
it
as
a
title
of
honour
the
title
of

was
usually
given
by

to

the

off
a

thence
to

the
tale
a
poor
widow
in
age
was
whilom
dwelling
in
a
poor
cottage
beside
a
grove
standing
in
a
dale
this
widow
of
which
i
telle
you
my
tale
since
thilke
day
that
she
was
last
a
wife
in
patience
led
a
full
simple
life
for
little
was
chattel
and
her

herself
and
eke
her
daughters
two
three
large
sowes
had
she
and
no
mo
three
kine
and
eke
a
sheep
that
highte
mall
full
sooty
was
her
and
eke
her
hall
in
which
she
ate
full
many
a
slender
meal
of
poignant
sauce
knew
she
never
a
deal
no
dainty
morsel
passed
through
her
throat
her
diet
was
to
her
cote
keeping
with
her
repletion
her
made
never
sick
diet
was
all
her
physic
and
exercise
and
suffisance
of
the
goute
her
nothing
for
to
dance
not
prevent
her
nor
apoplexy
not
her
head
from
no
wine
drank
she
neither
white
nor
red
her
board
was
served
most
with
white
and
black
milk
and
brown
bread
in
which
she
found
no
lack
bacon
and
sometimes
an
egg
or
tway
for
she
was
as
it
were
manner
dey
of
day
a
yard
she
had
enclosed
all
about
with
stickes
and
a
drye
ditch
without

which
she
had
a
cock
hight
chanticleer
in
all
the
land
of
crowing
his
peer
not
his
his
voice
was
merrier
than
the
merry
orgon
on
masse
days
that
in
the
churches
gon
well
was
his
crowing
in
his
lodge
than
is
a
clock
or
an
abbay
horloge
by
nature
he
knew
each
ascension
of
th
equinoctial
in
thilke
town
for
when
degrees
fiftene
were
ascended
then
crew
he
that
it
might
not
be
amended
his
comb
was
redder
than
the
fine
coral
embattell
as
it
were
a
castle
wall
his
bill
was
black
and
as
the
jet
it
shone
like
azure
were
his
legges
and
his
tone
his
nailes
whiter
than
the
lily
and
like
the
burnish
gold
was
his
colour
this
gentle
cock
had
in
his
governance
hennes
for
to
do
all
his
pleasance
which
were
his
sisters
and
his
paramours
and
wondrous
like
to
him
as

the

was
called
damoselle
partelote
courteous
she
was
discreet
and
debonair
and
companiable
and
bare
herself
so
fair
since
the
day
that
she
night
was
old
that
truely
she
had
the
heart
in
hold
of

locked
in
every

like
an
hound
and
would
have

my
body
and
would
have
had

dead
his
colour
was
betwixt
yellow

was
small
with
glowing
eyen
tway

beastes
that
they
will

such
a
great
renown
though
that
he
bade
no
dreames
for
to
dread
by
god
men
may
in
olde
bookes
read
of
many
a
man
more
of
authority
than
ever
cato
was
so
may
i
the
that
all
the
reverse
say
of
his
sentence
and
have
well
founden
by
experience
that
dreames
be
significations
as
well
of
joy
as
tribulations
that
folk
enduren
in
this
life
present
there
needeth
make
of
this
no
argument
the
very
sheweth
it
indeed
experience
one
of
the
greatest
authors
that
men
read
saith
thus
that
whilom
two
fellowes
went
on
pilgrimage
in
a
full
good
intent
and
happen
so
they
came
into
a
town
where
there
was
such
a
congregatioun
of
people
and
eke
so
of
herbergage
that
they
found
not
as
much
as
one
cottage
in
which
they
bothe
might
be
wherefore
they
musten
of
necessity
as
for
that
night
departe
company
and
each
of
them
went
to
his
hostelry
and
took
his
lodging
as
it
woulde
fall
the
one
of
them
was
lodged
in
a
stall
far
in
a
yard
with
oxen
of
the
plough
that
other
man
was
lodged
well
enow
as
was
his
aventure
or
his
fortune
that
us
governeth
all
as
in
commune
and
so
befell
that
long
ere
it
were
day
this
man
in
his
bed
there
as
he
lay
how
that
his
fellow
gan
upon
him
call
and
said
for
in
an
ox
stall
this
night
shall
i
be
murder
where
i
lie
now
help
me
deare
brother
or
i
die
in
alle
haste
come
to
me
he
said
this
man
out
of
his
sleep
for
fear
abraid
but
when
that
he
was
wak
out
of
his
sleep
he
turned
him
and
of
this
no
keep
this
no
he
thought
his
dream
was
but
a
vanity
thus
in
his
sleeping
dreamed
he
and
at
the
thirde
time
yet
his
fellaw
again
came
as
he
thought
and
said
am
now
slaw
behold
my
bloody
woundes
deep
and
wide
arise
up
early
in
the
morning
tide
and
at
the
west
gate
of
the
town
quoth
he
carte
full
of
dung
there
shalt
thou
see
in
which
my
body
is
hid
privily
do
thilke
cart
boldely
my
gold
caused
my
murder
sooth
to
sayn
and
told
him
every
point
how
he
was
slain
with
a
full
piteous
face
and
pale
of
hue
and
truste
well
his
dream
he
found
full
true
for
on
the
morrow
as
soon
as
it
was
day
to
his
fellowes
inn
he
took
his
way
and
when
that
he
came
to
this
ox
stall
after
his
fellow
he
began
to
call
the
hostelere
answered
him
anon
and
saide
your
fellow
is
as
soon
as
day
he
went
out
of
the
town
this
man
gan
fallen
in
suspicioun
on
his
dreames
that
he
mette
and
forth
he
went
no
longer
would
he
let
unto
the
west
gate
of
the
town
and
a
dung
cart
as
it
went
for
to
dung
land
that
was
arrayed
in
the
same
wise
as
ye
have
heard
the
deade
man
devise
and
with
an
hardy
heart
he
gan
to
cry
and
justice
of
this
felony
my
fellow
murder
in
this
same
night
and
in
this
cart
he
lies
gaping
upright
i
cry
out
on
the
ministers
quoth
he
shoulde
keep
and
rule
this
city
harow
alas
here
lies
my
fellow
slain
what
should
i
more
unto
this
tale
sayn
the
people
out
start
and
cast
the
cart
to
ground
and
in
the
middle
of
the
dung
they
found
the
deade
man
that
murder
was
all
new
o
blissful
god
that
art
so
good
and
true
lo
how
that
thou
murder
alway
murder
will
out
that
see
we
day
by
day
murder
is
so
and
abominable
to
god
that
is
so
just
and
reasonable
that
he
will
not
suffer
it
be
though
it
abide
a
year
or
two
or
three
murder
will
out
this
is
my
conclusioun
and
right
anon
the
ministers
of
the
town
have
the
carter
and
so
sore
him
pined
and
eke
the
hostelere
so
sore
engined
that
they
their
wickedness
anon
and
were
hanged
by
the
necke
bone
here
may
ye
see
that
dreames
be
to
dread
and
certes
in
the
same
book
i
read
right
in
the
nexte
chapter
after
this
i
not
so
have
i
joy
and
bliss
idly
two
men
that
would
have
passed
over
sea
for
certain
cause
into
a
far
country
if
that
the
wind
not
hadde
been
contrary
that
made
them
in
a
city
for
to
tarry
that
stood
full
merry
upon
an
haven
side
but
on
a
day
against
the
the
wind
gan
change
and
blew
right
them
lest
they
jolly
and
glad
they
wente
to
their
rest
and
them
full
early
for
to
sail
but
to
the
one
man
fell
a
great
marvail
that
one
of
them
in
sleeping
as
he
lay
he
a
wondrous
dream
against
the
day
he
thought
a
man
stood
by
his
bedde
side
and
him
commanded
that
he
should
abide
and
said
him
thus
thou
wend
thou
shalt
be
drown
my
tale
is
at
an
end
he
woke
and
told
his
follow
what
he
mette
and
prayed
him
his
voyage
for
to
let
as
for
that
day
he
pray
him
to
abide
his
fellow
that
lay
by
his
bedde
side
gan
for
to
laugh
and
scorned
him
full
fast
dream
quoth
he
so
my
heart
aghast
that
i
will
for
to
do
my
things
i
sette
not
a
straw
by
thy
dreamings
for
be
but
vanities
and
japes
deceits
men
dream
all
day
of
owles
and
of
apes
and
eke
of
many
a
therewithal
imagining
men
dream
of
thing
that
never
was
nor
shall
but
since
i
see
that
thou
wilt
here
abide
and
thus
wilfully
thy
tide
away
god
wot
rueth
me
and
have
good
day
am
sorry
for
and
thus
he
took
his
leave
and
went
his
way
but
ere
that
he
had
half
his
course
sail
i
know
not
why
nor
what
mischance
it
ail
but
the
ship
bottom
rent
accident
and
ship
and
man
under
the
water
went
in
sight
of
other
shippes
there
beside
that
with
him
sailed
at
the
same
tide
and
therefore
faire
partelote
so
dear
by
such
examples
olde
thou
lear
that
no
man
shoulde
be
too
reckeless
of
dreames
for
i
say
thee
doubteless
that
many
a
dream
full
sore
is
for
to
dread
lo
in
the
life
of
saint
kenelm
i
read
that
was
kenulphus
son
the
noble
king
of
mercenrike
how
kenelm
mette
a
thing
a
little
ere
he
was
murder
on
a
day
his
murder
in
his
vision
he
say
his
him
expounded
every
his
sweven
and
bade
him
to
him
well
for
treason
but
he
was
but
seven
years
old
and
therefore
tale
hath
he
attached
little
of
any
dream
so
holy
was
his
heart
significance
by
god
i
hadde
lever
than
my
shirt
that
ye
had
read
his
legend
as
have
dame
partelote
i
say
you
truely
macrobius
that
wrote
the
vision
in
afric
of

and
see
the
freshe
flowers
how
they
spring
full
is
mine
heart
of
revel
and
solace
but
suddenly
him
fell
a
sorrowful
case
for
ever
the
latter
end
of
joy
is
woe
god
wot
that
worldly
joy
is
soon
and
if
a
coulde
fair
indite
he
in
a
chronicle
might
it
safely
write
as
for
thing
supremely
now
every
wise
man
let
him
hearken
me
this
story
is
all
as
true
i
undertake
as
is
the
book
of
launcelot
du
lake
that
women
hold
in
full
great
reverence
now
will
i
turn
again
to
my
sentence
a
full
of
sly
iniquity
that
in
the
grove
had
yeares
three
by
high
imagination
forecast
the
same
night
thorough
the
hedges
into
the
yard
where
chanticleer
the
fair
was
wont
and
eke
his
wives
to
repair
and
in
a
bed
of
still
he
lay
till
it
was
passed
undern
of
the
day
waiting
his
time
on
chanticleer
to
fall
as
gladly
do
these
homicides
all
that
in
awaite
lie
to
murder
men
o
false
in
thy
den
lurking
o
new
iscariot
new
ganilion
o
false
dissimuler
o
greek
sinon
that
broughtest
troy
all
utterly
to
sorrow
o
chanticleer
accursed
be
the
morrow
that
thou
into
thy
yard
flew
from
the
beams
thou
wert
full
well
by
thy
dreams
that
thilke
day
was
perilous
to
thee
but
what
that
god
must
needes
be
after
th
opinion
of
certain
clerkes
witness
on
him
that
any
perfect
clerk
is
that
in
school
is
great
altercation
in
this
matter
and
great
disputation
and
hath
been
of
an
hundred
thousand
men
but
i
ne
can
not
it
to
the
bren
it
thoroughly
as
can
the
holy
doctor
augustine
or
boece
or
the
bishop
bradwardine
whether
that
godde
worthy
me
for
to
do
a
thing
needly
call
i
simple
necessity
or
elles
if
free
choice
be
granted
me
to
do
that
same
thing
or
do
it
not
though
god
it
ere
that
it
was
wrought
in
advance
or
if
weeting
straineth
never
a
deal
knowing
constrains
but
by
necessity
conditionel
not
at
i
will
not
have
to
do
of
such
mattere
my
tale
is
of
a
cock
as
ye
may
hear
that
took
his
counsel
of
his
wife
with
sorrow
to
walken
in
the
yard
upon
the
morrow
that
he
had
mette
the
dream
as
i
you
told
womane
counsels
be
full
often
cold
unwise
womane
counsel
brought
us
first
to
woe
and
made
adam
from
paradise
to
go
there
as
he
was
full
merry
and
well
at
case
but
for
i
to
whom
i
might
displease
not
if
i
counsel
of
women
woulde
blame
pass
over
for
i
said
it
in
my
game
read
authors
where
they
treat
of
such
mattere
and
what
they
say
of
women
ye
may
hear
these
be
the
cocke
wordes
and
not
mine
i
can
no
harm
of
no
woman
divine
imagine
fair
in
the
sand
to
her
merrily
lies
partelote
and
all
her
sisters
by
against
the
sun
and
chanticleer
so
free
sang
merrier
than
the
mermaid
in
the
sea
for
physiologus
saith
sickerly
how
that
they
singe
well
and
merrily
and
so
befell
that
as
he
cast
his
eye
among
the
wortes
on
a
butterfly
he
was
ware
of
this
fox
that
lay
full
low
nothing
list
him
for
to
crow
had
no
but
cried
anon
cock
cock
and
up
he
start
as
man
that
was
affrayed
in
his
heart
for
naturally
a
beast
desireth
flee
from
his
contrary
if
be
may
it
see
though
he
had
soon
it
with
his
eye
this
chanticleer
when
he
gan
him
espy
he
would
have
fled
but
that
the
fox
anon
said
gentle
sir

will
ye
gon
be
ye
afraid
of
me
that

your
friend

were
worse

fiend
if
i
to
you
would
harm
or
villainy
i
am
not
come
your
counsel
to
espy
but
truely
the
cause
of
my
coming
was
only
for
to
hearken
how
ye
sing
for
truely
ye
have
as
merry
a
steven
as
any
angel
hath
that
is
in
heaven
therewith
ye
have
of
music
more
feeling
than

and
eke

tway
possess
or

as
did
your
father
in
the
morrowning
certes
it
was
of
heart
all
that
he
sung
and
for
to
make
his
voice
the
more
strong
he
would
pain
him
that
with
both
his
eyen
such
an
he
muste
wink
so
loud
he
woulde
cryen
and
standen
on
his
tiptoes
therewithal
and
stretche
forth
his
necke
long
and
small
and
eke
he
was
of
such
discretion
that
there
was
no
man
in
no
region
that
him
in
song
or
wisdom
mighte
pass
i
have
well
read
in
dan
burnel
the
ass
among
his
verse
how
that
there
was
a
cock
that
a
prieste
son
gave
him
a
knock
upon
his
leg
while
he
was
young
and
nice
he
made
him
for
to
lose
his
benefice
but
certain
there
is
no
comparison
betwixt
the
wisdom
and
discretion
of
youre
father
and
his
subtilty
now
singe
sir
for
sainte
charity
let
see
can
ye
your
father
counterfeit
this
chanticleer
his
wings
began
to
beat
as
man
that

ravish
with
his
flattery

court
and
many
a
losengeour

my
faith
than

in
ecclesiast
of

ye
lordes
of
their
treachery
this
chanticleer
stood
high
upon

bare
for
yet
was
there
no

alas
that

and
on
a
friday
fell

mischance
o

goddess
of
pleasance
since
that
thy
servant
was
this
chanticleer
and
in
thy
service
did
all
his
powere
more
for
delight
than

why
wilt

suffer
him
on
thy
day
to

o
gaufrid
deare
master
sovereign
that
when
thy
worthy
king

then
would
i
shew

made
when

was
won
and
pyrrhus
with
his
straighte
sword
when

with
a
steadfast
heart
o

senatores
wives
for

their
husbands
losten
all
their
lives
withoute
guilt
this

my
tale
again
the
widow
and
her
daughters
two
honest
hearde
these
hennes
cry
and
make
woe
and
at
the
doors
out
started
they
anon
and
saw
the
fox
toward
the
wood
is
gone
and
bare
upon
his
back
the
cock
away
they
cried
out
harow
and
aha

and
after
him
they
ran
and

ranne
so
them
thought
their
hearts
would
break
they
yelled
as

the
duckes
cried
as

would
them
quell
destroy
the
geese
for
feare
flewen
the
trees
out
of
the
hive
came
the
swarm
of

so
hideous
was
the
noise
certes

and
his
meinie
ne
made
never
shoutes
half
so
shrill
when
that
they
woulden
any
fleming
kill
as
thilke
day
was
made
upon
the
fox
of
brass
they
broughte
and
of
box
of
horn
and
bone
in
which
they
blew
and
pooped
and
therewithal
they
shrieked
and
they
hooped
it
seemed
as
the
heaven
shoulde
fall
now
goode
men
i
pray
you
hearken
all
lo
how
fortune
turneth
suddenly
the
hope
and
pride
eke
of
her
enemy
this
cock
that
lay
upon
the
fox
back
in
all
his
dread
unto
the
fox
he

and
that
anon
the
fox

in
faith
it
shall
be
done
and
as
he
spake
the
word
all
suddenly
the
cock
brake
from
his
mouth
deliverly
and
high
upon
a
tree
he
flew
anon
and
when
the
fox
saw
that
the
cock
was
gone
alas
quoth
he
o
chanticleer
alas
i
have
quoth
he
to
you
trespass
inasmuch
as
i
maked
you
afear
when
i
you

and
brought
out
of
your

but
sir
i
did
it
in
no
wick
intent
come
down
and
i
shall

lo
what
it
is
for
to
be
reckeless
and
negligent
and
trust
on

but
ye
that

was
in
error
when
he
ascribed
the
tale
to

to
operate
were

under

represented
the

of

as

is

a
tale
of
a

who
having

broke
by
a

called

watched
an
opportunity
to

therefore
orders

this

thou
wouldest
be

he
with
full
merry
cheer
said
to

as
ye
shall
hear
notes
to
the
epilogue
to
the
nun

tale
the
sixteen
lines
appended
to
the
tale
of
the
nun
priest
seem
as
tyrwhitt
observes
to
commence
the
prologue
to
the
succeeding
tale
but
the
difficulty
is
to
determine
which
that
tale
should
be
in
earlier
editions
the
lines
formed
the
opening
of
the
prologue
to
the
manciple
tale
but
most
of
the
manuscripts
acknowledge
themselves
defective
in
this
part
and
give
the
nun
tale
after
that
of
the
nun
priest
in
the
harleian
manuscript
followed
by
mr
wright
the
second
nun
tale
and
the
canon
yeoman
tale
are
placed
after
the
franklin
tale
and
the
sixteen
lines
above
are
not
found
the
prologue
coming
immediately
after
the
amen
of
the
priest
in
two
manuscripts
the
last
line
of
the
sixteen
runs
thus
said
unto
the
nun
as
ye
shall
hear
and
six
lines
more
evidently
forged
are
given
to
introduce
the
nun
tale
all
this
confusion
and
doubt
only
strengthen
the
certainty
and
deepen
the
regret
that
the
canterbury
tales
were
left
at
chaucer
death
not
merely
very
imperfect
as
a
whole
but
destitute
of
many
finishing
touches
that
would
have
made
them
complete
so
far
as
the
conception
had
actually
been
carried
into
performance

of

shall
i
tell
quoth
she
ere
that
i
go
right
as
a

hath
three
faculties
memory
engine
and
intellect
also
so
in
one
being
of
divinity
three
persones
there
maye
right
well
be
then
gan
she
him
full
busily
to
preach
of
christe
coming
and
his
paines
teach
and
many
pointes
of
his
passion
how
godde
son
in
this
world
was
to
do
mankinde
remission
that
was
in
sin
and
cares
cold
all
this
thing
she
unto
tiburce
told
and
after
that
tiburce
in
good
intent
with
valerian
to
pope
urban
he
went
that
thanked
god
and
with
glad
heart
and
light
he
christen
him
and
made
him
in
that
place
perfect
in
his
learning
and
godde
knight
and
after
this
tiburce
got
such
grace
that
every
day
he
saw
in
time
and
space
th
angel
of
god
and
every
manner
favour
that
be
god
asked
it
was
full
anon
successful
it
were
full
hard
by
order
for
to
sayn
how
many
wonders
jesus
for
them
wrought
but
at
the
last
to
telle
short
and
plain
the
sergeants
of
the
town
of
rome
them
sought
and
them
before
almach
the
prefect
brought
which
them
apposed
and
knew
all
their
intent
and
to
of
jupiter
them
sent
and
said
whoso
will
not
do
sacrifice
off
his
head
this
is
my
sentence
here
anon
these
martyrs
i
you
devise
whom
i
tell
one
maximus
that
was
an
officere
of
the
prefect
and
his
corniculere
them
hent
and
when
he
forth
the
saintes
lad
himself
he
wept
for
pity
that
he
had
when
maximus
had
heard
the
saintes
lore
teaching
he
got
him
of
the
leave
and
led
them
to
his
house
withoute
more
and
with
their
preaching
ere
that
it
were
eve
they
from
the
tormentors
to
reave
root
out
and
from
maxim
and
from
his
folk
each
one
the
false
faith
to
in
god
alone
cecilia
came
when
it
was
waxen
night
with
priestes
that
them
christen
in
fere
a
and
afterward
when
day
was
waxen
light
cecile
them
said
with
a
full
steadfast
cheer
now
christe
owen
knightes
and
dear
cast
all
away
the
workes
of
darkness
and
arme
you
in
armour
of
brightness
ye
have
forsooth
a
great
battaile
your
course
is
done
your
faith
have
ye
conserved
o
to
the
crown
of
life
that
may
not
fail
the
rightful
judge
which
that
ye
have
served
shall
give
it
you
as
ye
have
it
deserved
and
when
this
thing
was
said
as
i
devise
relate
men
led
them
forth
to
do
the
sacrifice
but
when
they
were
unto
the
place
brought
to
telle
shortly
the
conclusion
they
would
incense
nor
sacrifice
right
nought
but
on
their
knees
they
sette
them
adown
with
humble
heart
and
devotion
and
loste
both
their
heades
in
the
place
their
soules
wente
to
the
king
of
grace
this
maximus
that
saw
this
thing
betide
with
piteous
teares
told
it
anon
right
that
he
their
soules
saw
to
heaven
glide
with
angels
full
of
clearness
and
of
light
andt
with
his
word
converted
many
a
wight
for
which
almachius
him
note
with
whip
of
lead
till
he
his
life
gan
lete
cecile
him
took
and
buried
him
anon
by
tiburce
and
valerian
softely
within
their
under
the
stone
and
after
this
almachius
hastily
bade
his
ministers
fetchen
openly
cecile
so
that
she
might
in
his
presence
do
sacrifice
and
jupiter
incense
incense
to
but
they
converted
at
her
wise
lore
wepte
full
sore
and
gave
full
credence
unto
her
word
and
cried
more
and
more
christ
godde
son
withoute
difference
is
very
god
this
is
all
our
sentence
that
hath
so
good
a
servant
him
to
serve
thus
with
one
voice
we
trowe
though
we
sterve
almachius
that
heard
of
this
doing
bade
fetch
cecilie
that
he
might
her
see
and
alderfirst
lo
this
was
his
asking
of
all
what
manner
woman
arte
thou
quoth
he
i
am
a
gentle
woman
born
quoth
she
i
aske
thee
quoth
he
though
it
thee
grieve
of
thy
religion
and
of
thy
believe
ye
have
begun
your
question
foolishly
quoth
she
that
wouldest
two
answers
conclude
in
one
demand
ye
aske
lewedly
almach
answer
to
that
similitude
of
whence
comes
thine
answering
so
rude
of
whence
quoth
she
when
that
she
was
freined
of
conscience
and
of
good
faith
unfeigned
almachius
saide
takest
thou
no
heed
of
my
power
and
she
him
answer
this
your
might
quoth
she
full
little
is
to
dread
for
every
mortal
manne
power
is
but
like
a
bladder
full
of
wind
for
with
a
needle
point
when
it
is

may
all
the
boast
of
it
be
laid
full
low
full
wrongfully
begunnest
thou
quoth

how
our
mighty
princes
free
have
thus
commanded
and
made

and
go
all
quit
if
he
will
it
renay
your
princes
erren
as
your
doth
quoth
then
cecile
and
with
a
ye
make
us
guilty
and
it
is
not
sooth
for
ye
that
knowe
well
our
innocence
forasmuch
as
we
do
aye
reverence
to
christ
and
for
we
bear
a
christian
name
ye
put
on
us
a
crime
and
eke
a
blame
but
we
that
knowe

so
for

i
you
that
reade
what
i
write
as
internal
evidence
that
the
insertion
of

in

was
the
result
of
an
afterthought
while
the
whole
tenor
of
the
introduction
confirms
the
belief
that
chaucer
composed
it
as
a
writer
or
translator
not
dramatically
as

story
is
almost

tale
the

when
ended
was
the
life
of
saint
cecile
ere
we
had
ridden
fully
five
mile
at
us
gan
a
man
that
clothed
was
in
clothes
black
and
underneath
he
wore
a
white
surplice
his
hackenay
which
was
all
so
sweated
that
it
wonder
was
to
see
it
seem
as
he
had
miles
three
the
horse
eke
that
his
yeoman
rode
upon
so
sweated
that
might
he
gon
about
the
peytrel
stood
the

full
high
he
was
of
foam
as
as
a
pie
like
a
a
maile
twyfold
on
his
crupper
lay
it
seemed
that
he
carried
little
array
all
light
for
summer
rode
this
worthy
man
and
in
my
heart
to
wonder
i
began
what
that
he
was
till
that
i
understood
how
that
his
cloak
was
sewed
to
his
hood
for
which
when
i
had
long
me
i
deemed
him
some
canon
for
to
be
his
hat
hung
at
his
back
down
by
a
lace
for
he
had
ridden
more
than
trot
or
pace
he
hadde
pricked
like
as
he
were
wood
a
he
had
laid
under
his
hood
for
sweat
and
for
to
keep
his
head
from
heat
but
it
was
joye
for
to
see
him
sweat
his
forehead
dropped
as
a
were
full
of
plantain
or
of
paritory
and
when
that
he
was
come
he
gan
to
cry
god
save
quoth
he
this
jolly
company
fast
have
i
pricked
quoth
he
for
your
sake
because
that
i
would
you
overtake
to
riden
in
this
merry
company
his
yeoman
was
eke
full
of
courtesy
and
saide
sirs
now
in
the
morning
tide
out
of
your
hostelry
i
saw
you
ride
and
warned
here
my
lord
and
sovereign
which
that
to
ride
with
you
is
full
fain
for
his
disport
he
loveth

for
thy
warning
god
give
thee
good

said
oure
host
certain
it
woulde
seem
thy
lord
were
wise
and
so
i
may
well
deem
he
is
full
jocund
also
dare
i
lay
can
he
aught
tell
a
merry
tale
or
tway
with
which
he
gladden
may
this
company
who
sir
my
lord
yea
sir
withoute
lie
he
of
mirth
and
eke
of
jollity
enough
also
sir
truste
me
less
ye
him
knew
all
so
well
as
do
i
ye
would
wonder
how
well
and
craftily
he
coulde
work
and
that
in
sundry
wise
he
hath
take
on
him
many
a
great
emprise
undertaking
which
were
full
hard
for
any
that
is
here
to
bring
about
they
of
him
it
lear
as
homely
as
he
rides
amonges
you
if
ye
him
knew
it
would
be
for
your
prow
ye
woulde
not
forego
his
acquaintance
for
muche
good
i
dare
lay
in
balance
all
that
i
have
in
my
possession
he
is
a
man
of
high
discretion
i
warn
you
well
he
is
a
man
extraordinary
well
quoth
our
host
i
pray
thee
tell
me
than
is
he
a
clerk
or
no
tell
what
he
is
priest
nay
he
is
greater
than
a
clerk
saide
this
yeoman
and
in
wordes
few
host
of
his
craft
somewhat
i
will
you
shew
i
say
my
lord
such
a
subtlety
but
all
his
craft
ye
may
not
of
me
and
somewhat
help
i
yet
to
his
working
that
all
the
ground
on
which
we
be
riding
till
that
we
come
to
canterbury
town
he
could
all
cleane
turnen
up
so
down
and
pave
it
all
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
when
this
yeoman
had
this
tale
told
unto
our
host
he
said
this
thing
is
wonder
marvellous
to
me
since
that
thy
lord
is
of
so
high
prudence
because
of
which
men
should
him
reverence
that
of
his
recketh
he
so
lite
his
it
is
not
worth
a
mite
as
in
effect
to
him
so
may
i
go
it
is
all
and
also
why
is
thy
lord
so
sluttish
i
thee
pray
and
is
of
power
better
clothes
to
bey
if
that
his
deed
accordeth
with
thy
speech
telle
me
that
and
that
i
thee
beseech
why
quoth
this
yeoman
whereto
ask
ye
me
god
help
me
so
for
he
shall
never
but
i
will
not
that
i
say
and
therefore
keep
it
secret
i
you
pray
he
is
too
wise
in
faith
as
i
believe
thing
that
is
overdone
it
will
not
the
test
aright
as
clerkes
say
it
is
a
vice
wherefore
in
that
i
hold
him
and
nice
and
for
when
a
man
hath
over
great
a
wit
full
oft
him
happens
to
misusen
it
so
doth
my
lord
and
that
me
grieveth
sore
god
it
amend
i
can
say
now
no
more
thereof
force
good
yeoman
quoth
our
host
since
of
the
of
thy
lord
thou
tell
how
he
doth
i
pray
thee
heartily
since
that
be
is
so
crafty
and
so
sly
where
dwelle
ye
if
it
to
telle
be
in
the
suburbes
of
a
town
quoth
he
lurking
in
and
in
lanes
blind
where
as
these
robbers
and
these
thieves
by
holde
their
privy
fearful
residence
as
they
that
dare
not
show
their
presence
so
fare
we
if
i
shall
say
the
soothe
yet
quoth
our
hoste
let
me
talke
to
thee
why
art
thou
so
discolour
of
thy
face
peter
quoth
he
god
give
it
harde
grace
i
am
so
us
the
hote
fire
to
blow
that
it
hath
changed
my
colour
i
trow
i
am
not
wont
in
no
mirror
to
pry
but
sore
and
learn
to
multiply
we
ever
and
in
the
fire
and
for
all
that
we
fail
of
our
desire
for
ever
we
lack
our
conclusion
to
muche
folk
we
do
illusion
and
borrow
gold
be
it
a
pound
or
two
or
ten
or
twelve
or
many
summes
mo
and
make
them
weenen
at
the
leaste
way
that
of
a
pounde
we
can
make
tway
yet
is
it
false
and
aye
we
have
good
hope
it
for
to
do
and
after
it
we
grope
strive
but
that
science
is
so
far
us
beforn
that
we
may
not
although
we
had
it
sworn
it
overtake
it
slides
away
so
fast
it
will
us
make
beggars
at
the
last
while
this
yeoman
was
thus
in
his
talking
this
canon
drew
him
near
and
heard
all
thing
which
this
yeoman
spake
for
suspicion
of
menne
speech
ever
had
this
canon
for
cato
saith
that
he
that
guilty
is
deemeth
all
things
be
spoken
of
him
because
of
that
he
gan
so
nigh
to
draw
to
his
yeoman
that
he
heard
all
his
saw
and
thus
he
said
unto
his
yeoman
hold
thou
thy
peace
and
speak
no
wordes
mo
for
if
thou
do
thou
shalt
dear
abie
dearly
for
thou
slanderest
me
here
in
this
company
and
eke
discoverest
that
thou
shouldest
hide
yea
quoth
our
host
tell
on
whatso
betide
of
all
his
threatening
reck
not
a
mite
in
faith
quoth
he
no
more
do
i
but
lite
and
when
this
canon
saw
it
would
not
be
but
his
yeoman
would
tell
his
privity
he
fled
away
for
very
sorrow
and
shame
ah
quoth
the
yeoman
here
shall
rise
a
game
diversion
all
that
i
can
anon
i
will
you
tell
since
he
is
gone
the
foule
fiend
him
quell
for
hereafter
will
i
with
him
meet
for
penny
nor
for
pound
i
you
behete
he
that
me
broughte
first
unto
that
game
ere
that
he
die
sorrow
have
he
and
shame
for
it
is
to
me
by
my
faith
serious
matter
that
feel
i
well
what
so
any
man
saith
and
yet
for
all
my
smart
and
all
my
grief
for
all
my
sorrow
labour
and
mischief
i
coulde
never
leave
it
in
no
wise
now
would
to
god
my
witte
might
suffice
to
tellen
all
that
longeth
to
that
art
but
natheless
yet
will
i
telle
part
since
that
my
lord
is
gone
i
will
not
spare
such
thing
as
that
i
know
i
will
declare
notes
to
the
prologue
to
the
canon
yeoman
tale
the
introduction
says
tyrwhitt
of
the
yeoman
to
tell
a
tale
at
a
time
when
so
many
of
the
original
characters
remain
to
be
called
upon
appears
a
little
extraordinary
it
should
seem
that
some
sudden
resentment
had
determined
chaucer
to
interrupt
the
regular
course
of
his
work
in
order
to
insert
a
satire
against
the
alchemists
that
their
pretended
science
was
much
cultivated
about
this
time
and
produced
its
usual
evils
may
fairly
be
inferred
from
the
act
which
was
passed
soon
after
iv
c
to
make
it
felony
multiply
gold
or
silver
or
to
use
the
art
of
multiplication
tyrwhitt
finds
in
the
prologue
some
colour
for
the
hypothesis
that
this
tale
was
intended
by
chaucer
to
begin
the
return
journey
from
canterbury
but
against
this
must
be
set
the
fact
that
the
yeoman
himself
expressly
speaks
of
the
distance
to
canterbury
yet
to
be
ridden
fully
five
mile
from
some
place
which
the
loss
of
the
second

does
not

i
fare
and
yet
i
am
indebted
so
thereby
of
gold
that
i
have
borrow
truely
that
while
i
live
i
shall
it
never
let
every
man
beware
by
me
for
ever
what
manner
man
that
him
thereto
if
he
continue
i
hold
thrift
at
an
so
help
me
god
thereby
shall
he
not
win
but
empty
his
purse
and
make
his
wittes
thin
and
when
he
through
his
madness
and
folly
hath
lost
his
owen
good
through
jupartie
then
he
exciteth
other
men
thereto
to
lose
their
good
as
he
himself
hath
do
for
unto
joy
it
is
and
ease
folk
to
have
their
fellows
in
pain
and
disease
thus
was
i
ones
learned
of
a
clerk
of
that
no
charge
i
will
speak
of
our
work
when
we
be
there
as
we
shall
exercise
our
craft
we
seeme
wonder
wise
wicked
our
termes
be
so
and
quaint
and
strange
i
blow
the
fire
till
that
mine
hearte
faint
why
should
i
tellen
each
proportion
of
thinges
whiche
that
we
work
upon
as
on
five
or
six
ounces
may
well
be
of
silver
or
some
other
quantity
and
busy
me
to
telle
you
the
names
as
orpiment
burnt
bones
iron
squames
that
into
powder
grounden
be
full
small
and
in
an
earthen
pot
how
put
is
all
and
salt
in
and
also
peppere
before
these
powders
that
i
speak
of
here
and
well
with
a
lamp
of
glass
and
of
much
other
thing
which
that
there
was
and
of
the
pots
and
glasses
engluting
up
that
of
the
air
might
passen
out
no
thing
and
of
the
fire
and
also
which
that
was
made
and
of
the
care
and
woe
that
we
had
in
our
matters
subliming
and
in
amalgaming
and
calcining
of
quicksilver
called
mercury
crude
for
all
our
sleightes
we
can
not
conclude
our
orpiment
and
sublim
mercury
our
ground
eke
on
the
porphyry
lead
of
each
of
these
of
ounces
a
certain
proportion
not
helpeth
us
our
labour
is
in
vain
nor
neither
our
spirits
ascensioun
nor
our
matters
that
lie
all
fix
adown
may
in
our
working
nothing
us
avail
for
lost
is
all
our
labour
and
travail
and
all
the
cost
a
twenty
devil
way
is
lost
also
which
we
upon
it
lay
there
is
also
full
many
another
thing
that
is
unto
our
craft
appertaining
though
i
by
order
them
not
rehearse
can
because
that
i
am
a

yet
will
i
tell
them
as

exercise
he
shall
no

have
that
him
may
suffice
for
all
the
good
he
spendeth
thereabout
he

shall
thereof
have
i
no
doubt
whoso
that
list
to
his
folly
let
him
come
forth
and
learn
to
multiply
and
every
man
that
hath
aught
in
his
coffer
let
him
appear
and
wax
a
philosopher
that
craft
is
so
light
to
lear
if
nay
nay
god
wot
all
be

monk

or
any
other
wight
though
he
sit
at
his
book
both
day
and
night
in
learning
of
this
lore
fantastic
foolish
all
is
in
vain
and
pardie
muche
more
is
to
learn
a
man
this
subtlety
fie
speak
not
thereof
for
it
will
not
be
and
he
letterure
or
conne
he
none
he
knows
as
in
effect
he
shall
it
find
all
one
for
bothe
two
by
my
salvation
concluden
in
by
alchemy
alike
well
when
they
have
all
this
is
to
say
they
faile
bothe
two
yet
forgot
i
to
make
rehearsale
of
waters
corrosive
and
of

and
of

mollification
and
also
of
their
induration
oiles
ablutions
metal
fusible
to
tellen
all
would
passen
any
bible
that
is
wherefore
as
for
the
best
of
all
these
names
now
will
i
me
rest
for
as
i
trow
i
have
you
told
enough
to
raise
a
fiend
all
look
he
so
rough
ah
nay
let
be
the
philosopher
stone
elixir
call
we
seeke
fast
each
one
for
had
we
him
then
were
we
enow
but
unto
god
of
heaven
i
make
avow
for
all
our
craft
when
we
have
all
and
all
our
sleight
he
will
not
come
us
to
he
hath
us
spende
muche
good
for
sorrow
of
which
almost
we
waxed
wood
but
that
good
hope
creeped
in
our
heart
supposing
ever
though
we
sore
smart
to
be
relieved
by
him
afterward
such
supposing
and
hope
is
sharp
and
hard
i
warn
you
well
it
is
to
seeken
ever
that
future
hath
made
men
dissever
from
in
trust
thereof
from
all
that
ever
they
had
yet
of
that
art
they
can
not
waxe
sad
for
unto
them
it
is
a
bitter
sweet
so
seemeth
it
for
had
they
but
a
sheet
which
that
they
mighte
wrap
them
in
at
night
and
a
to
walk
in
by
dayelight
they
would
them
sell
and
spend
it
on
this
craft
they
can
not
stint
until
no
thing
be
laft
and
evermore
wherever
that
they
gon
men
may
them
knowe
by
smell
of
brimstone
for
all
the
world
they
stinken
as
a
goat
their
savour
is
so
rammish
and
so
hot
that
though
a
man
a
mile
from
them
be
the
savour
will
infect
him
truste
me
lo
thus
by
smelling
and
threadbare
array
if
that
men
list
this
folk
they
knowe
may
and
if
a
man
will
ask
them
privily
why
they
be
clothed
so
unthriftily
they
right
anon
will
in
his
ear
and
sayen
if
that
they
espied
were
men
would
them
slay
because
of
their
science
lo
thus
these
folk
betrayen
innocence
pass
over
this
i
go
my
tale
unto
ere
that
the
pot
be
on
the
fire
of
metals
with
a
certain
quantity
my
lord
them
tempers
and
no
man
but
he
the
proportions
now
he
is
gone
i
dare
say
boldely
for
as
men
say
he
can
do
craftily
i
wot
well
he
hath
such
a
name
and
yet
full
oft
he
runneth
into
blame
and
know
ye
how
full
oft
it
so
the
pot
and
farewell
all
is
go
these
metals
be
of
so
great
violence
our
walles
may
not
make
them
resistence
they
were
wrought
of
lime
and
stone
they
pierce
so
that
through
the
wall
they
gon
and
some
of
them
sink
down
into
the
ground
thus
have
we
lost
by
times
many
a
pound
and
some
are
scatter
all
the
floor
about
some
leap
into
the
roof
withoute
doubt
though
that
the
fiend
not
in
our
sight
him
show
i
trowe
that
he
be
with
us
that
shrew
wretch
in
helle
where
that
he
is
lord
and
sire
is
there
no
more
woe
rancour
nor
ire
when
that
our
pot
is
broke
as
i
have
said
every
man
chides
and
holds
him
apaid
some
said
it
was
the
of
some
saide
nay
it
was
on
the
blowing
then
was
i
fear
for
that
was
mine
office
straw
quoth
the
third
ye
be
and
it
was
not
as
it
ought
to
be
in
due
proportions
nay
quoth
the
fourthe
and
hearken
me
because
our
fire
was
not
of
beech
that
is
the
cause
and
other
none
may
i
i
can
not
tell
whereon
it
was
along
but
well
i
wot
great
strife
is
us
among
what
quoth
my
lord
there
is
no
more
to
of
these
perils
i
will
beware
eftsoon
time
i
am
right
that
the
pot
was
crazed
be
as
be
may
be
ye
no
thing
amazed
as
usage
is
let
sweep
the
floor
as
swithe
pluck
up
your
heartes
and
be
glad
and
blithe
the
on
a
heap
was
and
on
the
floor
a
canevas
and
all
this
mullok
in
a
sieve
and
sifted
and
many
a
throw
pardie
quoth
one
somewhat
of
our
metal
yet
is
there
here
though
that
we
have
not
all
and
though
this
thing
hath
as
now
gone
amiss
another
time
it
may
be
well
enow
at
we
muste
our
good
in
adventure
our
a
merchant
pardie
may
not
aye
endure
truste
me
well
in
his
prosperity
sometimes
his
good
is
in
the
sea
sunk
and
sometimes
comes
it
safe
unto
the
land
peace
quoth
my
lord
the
next
time
i
will
to
bring
our
craft
in
another
plight
a
different
and
but
i
do
sirs
let
me
have
the
wite
there
was
default
in
somewhat
well
i
wot
another
said
the
fire
was
over
hot
but
be
it
hot
or
cold
i
dare
say
this
that
we
concluden
evermore
amiss
we
fail
alway
of
that
which
we
would
have
and
in
our
madness
evermore
we
rave
and
when
we
be
together
every
one
every
man
seemeth
a
solomon
but
all
thing
which
that
shineth
as
the
gold
it
is
not
gold
as
i
have
heard
it
told
nor
every
apple
that
is
fair
at
eye
it
is
not
good
what
so
men
or
cry
right
so
lo
fareth
it
amonges
us
he
that
the
wisest
seemeth
by
jesus
is
most
fool
when
it
cometh
to
the
prefe
test
and
he
that
seemeth
truest
is
a
thief
that
shall
ye
know
ere
that
i
from
you
wend
by
that
i
of
my
tale
have
made
an
end
there
was
a
canon
of
religioun
amonges
us
would
all
a
town
though
it
as
great
were
as
was
nineveh
rome
alisandre
troy
or
other
three
his
and
his
infinite
falseness
tricks
there
coulde
no
man
writen
as
i
guess
though
that
he
mighte
live
a
thousand
year
in
all
this
world
of
falseness
his
peer
is
not
for
in
his
termes
he
will
him
so
wind
and
speak
his
wordes
in
so
sly
a
kind
when
he
commune
shall
with
any
wight
that
he
will
make
him
anon
aright
foolishly
but
it
a
fiende
be
as
himself
is
fond
of
full
many
a
man
hath
he
beguil
ere
this
and
will
if
that
he
may
live
any
while
and
yet
men
go
and
ride
many
a
mile
him
for
to
seek
and
have
his
acquaintance
not
knowing
of
his
false
governance
conduct
and
if
you
list
to
give
me
audience
i
will
it
telle
here
in
your
presence
but
worshipful
canons
religious
ne
deeme
not
that
i
slander
your
house
although
that
my
tale
of
a
canon
be
of
every
order
some
shrew
is
pardie
and
god
forbid
that
all
a
company
should
rue
a
manne
folly
to
slander
you
is
no
thing
mine
intent
but
to
correct
that
is
amiss
i
meant
this
tale
was
not
only
told
for
you
but
eke
for
other
more
ye
wot
well
how
that
amonges
christe
apostles
twelve
there
was
no
traitor
but
judas
himselve
then
why
should
all
the
remenant
have
blame
that
guiltless
were
by
you
i
say
the
same
save
only
this
if
ye
will
hearken
me
if
any
judas
in
your
convent
be
remove
him
betimes
i
you
rede
if
shame
or
loss
may
causen
any
dread
and
be
no
thing
displeased
i
you
pray
but
in
this
case
hearken
what
i
say
in
london
was
a
priest
an
annualere
that
therein
dwelled
hadde
many
a
year
which
was
so
pleasant
and
so
serviceable
unto
the
wife
where
as
he
was
at
table
that
she
would
suffer
him
no
thing
to
pay
for
board
nor
clothing
went
he
so
gay
and
spending
silver
had
he
right
enow
thereof
no
force
will
proceed
as
now
matter
and
telle
forth
my
tale
of
the
canon
that
brought
this
prieste
to
confusion
this
false
canon
came
upon
a
day
unto
the
prieste
chamber
where
he
lay
beseeching
him
to
lend
him
a
certain
of
gold
and
he
would
quit
it
him
again
lend
me
a
mark
quoth
he
but
dayes
three
and
at
my
day
i
will
it
quite
thee
and
if
it
so
be
that
thou
find
me
false
another
day
hang
me
up
by
the
halse
this
priest
him
took
a
mark
and
that
as
swithe
and
this
canon
him
thanked
often
sithe
and
took
his
leave
and
wente
forth
his
way
and
at
the
thirde
day
brought
his
money
and
to
the
priest
he
took
his
gold
again
whereof
this
priest
was
wondrous
glad
and
fain
certes
quoth
he
nothing
annoyeth
am
not
to
lend
a
man
a
noble
or
two
or
three
or
what
thing
were
in
my
possession
when
he
so
true
is
of
condition
that
in
no
wise
he
breake
will
his
day
to
such
a
man
i
never
can
say
nay
what
quoth
this
canon
should
i
be
untrue
nay
that
were
all
of
new
new
thing
to
truth
is
a
thing
that
i
will
ever
keep
unto
the
day
in
which
that
i
shall
creep
into
my
grave
and
elles
god
forbid
believe
this
as
as
your
creed
god
thank
i
and
in
good
time
be
it
said
that
there
was
never
man
yet
for
gold
nor
silver
that
he
to
me
lent
nor
ever
falsehood
in
mine
heart
i
meant
and
sir
quoth
he
now
of
my
privity
since
ye
so
goodly
have
been
unto
me
and
to
me
so
great
gentleness
somewhat
to
quite
with
your
kindeness
i
will
you
shew
and
if
you
list
to
lear
i
will
you
teache
plainly
the
mannere
how
i
can
worken
in
philosophy
take
good
heed
ye
shall
well
see
your
own
that
i
will
do
a
ere
i
go
yea
quoth
the
priest
yea
sir
and
will
ye
so
mary
thereof
i
pray
you
heartily
at
your
commandement
sir
truely
quoth
the
canon
and
elles
god
forbid
lo
how
this
thiefe
could
his
service
bede
full
sooth
it
is
that
such
proffer
service
stinketh
as
witnesse
olde
wise
wise
folk
of
and
that
full
soon
i
will
it
verify
in
this
canon
root
of
all
treachery
that
evermore
delight
had
and
gladness
such
fiendly
thoughtes
his
heart
into
his
how
christe
people
he
may
to
mischief
bring
god
keep
us
from
his
false
dissimuling
what
wiste
this
priest
with
whom
that
he
dealt
nor
of
his
harm
coming
he
nothing
felt
o
priest
o
sely
innocent
with
covetise
anon
thou
shalt
be
blent
beguiled
o
graceless
full
blind
is
thy
conceit
for
nothing
art
thou
ware
of
the
deceit
which
that
this
fox
hath
to

it
in
the
wise
of

this
canon
this
cursed
man
commanded
him
and
fast
he
blew
the
fire
for
to
come
to
th
effect
of
his
desire
and
this
canon
right
in
the
meanewhile
all
ready
was
this

to

and
for
a
countenance
in
his
hande

and
beware
of
silver
limaile
put
was
as
before
was
in

and
stopped
with
wax
well
for
to
keep
in
his
limaile
every
deal
and
while
this
priest
was
in
his
business
this
canon
with
his
sticke
gan
him
to
him
anon
and
his
powder
cast
in
as
he
did
erst
the
devil
out
of
his
skin
him
turn
i
pray
to
god
for
his
falsehead
for
he
was
ever
false
in
thought
and
deed
and

his
stick
above
the
crosselet
that
was
with
that
false
get
he
stirr
the
coales
till
relente
gan
the
wax
against
the
fire
as
every

but
he
a
fool

well
it
must
need
and
all
that
in
the
sticke
was
out
yede
and
in
the
croslet
it
fell
now
goode
sirs
what
will
ye
than
well
when
that
this
priest
was
thus
beguil
again
supposing
naught
but
truthe
sooth
to
sayn
he
was
so
glad
that
i
can
not
express
in
no
mannere
his
mirth
and
his
gladness
and
to
the
canon
he
proffer
again
body
and
good
yea
quoth
the
canon
soon
though
poor
i
be
thou
shalt
me
find
i
warn
thee
well
yet
is
there
more
behind
is
any
copper
here

said
he
yea
sir
the
prieste
said
i

some
and
that
as
swithe
now
goode
sir
go
forth

way
and
thee
he
went
his
way
and
with
the
copper
came
and
this
canon
it
in
his
handes
name
and
of
that
copper
weighed
out
an
ounce
too
simple
is
my
tongue
to
pronounce
as
minister
of
my
wit
the
doubleness
of
this
canon
root
of
all
cursedness
he
friendly
seem
to
them
that
knew
him
not
but
he
was
fiendly
both
in
work
and
thought
it
wearieth
me
to
tell
of
his
falseness
and
natheless
yet
will
i
it
express
to
that
intent
men
may
beware
thereby
and
for
none
other
cause
truely
he
put
this
copper
in
the
crosselet
and
on
the
fire
as
he
hath
it
set
and
cast
in
powder
and
made
the
priest
to
blow
and
in
his
working
for
to
stoope
low
as
he
did
erst
and
all
was
but
a
jape
right
as
him
list
the
priest
made
his
ape
and
afterward
in
the
ingot
he
it
cast
and
in
the
pan
he
put
it
at
the
last
of
water
and
in
he
put
his
own
hand
and
in
his
sleeve
as
ye
beforehand
hearde
me
tell
he
had
a
silver
teine
piece
he
silly
took
it
out
this
cursed
this
priest
of
his
false
craft
and
in
the
panne
bottom
he
it
and
in
the
water
rumbleth
to
and
fro
and
wondrous
privily
took
up
also
the
copper
teine
not
knowing
thilke
priest
and
hid
it
and
him
by
the
breast
and
to
him
spake
and
thus
said
in
his
game

i
did
you
whilere

teine
anon
and
thenne
said
the
canon

these
three
teines
which

we
have
wrought

some
goldsmith
and
if
they
be

my
faith
i
would
not

as
well
proved
shall
it
be
unto
the
goldsmith
with
these
teines
three
they
went
anon
and
put
them
in
to
fire
and

as

he
saith
right
thus
withouten
any

there
may
no

it
be
with

lo
how
that
he
which
firste
said
this

of

father
was
hermes
he
saith
how
that
the

doubteless
he
dieth
not
but
if
that
he
be
slain
with
his

and
this
is
for
to

by

mercury
and
none
other
he
understood
and
brimstone
by
his

that
out
of

were
derived
and
therefore
said
he
take
heed
to
my
saw
let
no
man
busy
him
this
art
to
seech
explore
that
he
and
speech
of
philosophers
understande
can
and
if
he
do
he
is
a
man
foolish
for
this
science
and
this
conning
quoth
he
is
of
the
secret
of
secrets
pardie
also
there
was
a
disciple
of
plato
that
on
a
time
said
his
master
to
as
his
book
senior
will
bear
witness
and
this
was
his
demand
in
soothfastness
tell
me
the
name
of
stone
and
plato
answer
unto
him
anon
take
the
stone
that
titanos
men
name
which
is
that
quoth
he
magnesia
is
the
same
saide
plato
yea
sir
and
is
it
thus
this
is
ignotum
per

what
is
magnesia
good
sir
i
pray
it
is
a
water
that
is
made
i
say
of
th
elementes
foure
quoth
plato
tell
me
the
roote
good
sir
quoth
he
tho
of
that
water
if
that
it
be
your
will
nay
nay
quoth
plato
certain
that
i
not
the
philosophers
sworn
were
every
one
that
they
should
not
discover
it
to
none
nor
in
no
book
it
write
in
no
mannere
for
unto
god
it
is
so
and
dear
that
he
will
not
that
it
discover
be
but
where
it
liketh
to
his
deity
man
for
to
inspire
and
eke
for
to
whom
that
he
liketh
lo
this
is
the
end
then
thus
conclude
i
since
that
god
of
heaven
will
not
that
these
philosophers
how
that
a

shall
come
unto
this

and
down

him
cast
where
as
he
lay
till
that
men
him
up
took
this
was
a

expedition
alas
that
he
had
held
him
by

and
ere
that
he
again
were
in

there
was
great
shoving

domination
upon

also
hath
to

that

not

if

proof
quoth
the

that

so

he
lightly
bring

alas
what
needed
it
he
drank
enough
beforn
and
when
he
hadde
in
his
horn
to
the
manciple
he
took
the
gourd
again
and
of
that
drink
the
cook
was
wondrous
fain
and
thanked
him
in
such
wise
as
he
could
then
gan
our
host
to
laughe
wondrous
loud
and
said
i
see
well
it
is
necessary
where
that
we
go

thee
pray
well
sir
quoth
he
now
hearken
what
i

notes
to
the
prologue
to

tale
mr
wright
supposes
this
to
be
the
village
of
harbledown
near
canterbury
which
is
situated
on
a
hill
and
near
which
there
are
many
ups
and
downs
in
the
road
like
boughton
where
the
canon
and
his
yeoman
overtook
the
pilgrims
it
stood
on
the
skirts
of
the
kentish
forest
of
blean
or
blee
dun
is
in
the
mire
a
proverbial
saying
dun
is
a
name
for
an
ass
derived
from
his
colour
the
mention
of
the
cook
here
with
no
hint
that
he
had
already
told
a
story
confirms
the
indication
given
by
the
imperfect
condition
of
his
tale
that
chaucer
intended
to
suppress
the
tale
altogether
and
make
him
tell
a
story
in
some
other
place
the
quintain
called
fan
or
vane
because
it
turned
round
like
a
referring
to
the
classification
of
wine
according
to
its
effects
on
a
man
given
in
the
old
calendrier
des
bergiers
the
man
of
choleric
temperament
has
wine
of
lion
the
sanguine
wine
of

the
phlegmatic
wine
of

the
melancholic
wine
of
sow
there
is
a
rabbinical
tradition
that
when
noah
was
planting
vines
satan
slaughtered
beside
them
the
four
animals
named
hence
the
effect
of
wine
in
making
those
who
drink
it
display
in

the
characteristics
of
all
the
four

bring
thee
to
his
lure
a
phrase
in
hawking
to
recall
a
hawk
to
the
fist
the
meaning
here
is
that
the
cook
may
one
day
bring
the
manciple
to
account
or
pay
him
off
for
the
rebuke
of
his
drunkenness
the
tale
when
phoebus
dwelled
here
in
earth
adown
as
olde
bookes
make
mentioun
he
was
the
moste
bacheler
of
all
this
world
and
the
best
archer
he
slew
python
the
serpent
as
he
lay
sleeping
against
the
sun
upon
a
day
and
many
another
noble
worthy
deed
he
with
his
bow
wrought
as
men
maye
read
playen
he
could
on
every
minstrelsy
and
singe
that
it
was
a
melody
to
hearen
of
his
cleare
voice
the
soun
certes
the
king
of
thebes
amphioun
that
with
his
singing
walled
the
city
could
never
singe
half
so
well
as
he
thereto
he
was
the
seemlieste
man
that
is
or
was
since
that
the
world
began
what
needeth
it
his
features
to
descrive
for
in
this
world
is
none
so
fair
alive
he
was
therewith
full
fill
of
gentleness
of
honour
and
of
perfect
worthiness
this
phoebus
that
was
flower
of
as
well
in
as
in
chivalry
for
his
disport
in
sign
eke
of
victory
of
python
so
as
telleth
us
the
story
was
wont
to
bearen
in
his
hand
a
bow
now
had
this
phoebus
in
his
house
a
crow
which
in
a
cage
he
foster
many
a
day
and
taught
it
speaken
as
men
teach
a
jay
white
was
this
crow
as
is
a
swan
and
counterfeit
the
speech
of
every
man
he
coulde
when
he
shoulde
tell
a
tale
therewith
in
all
this
world
no
nightingale
ne
coulde
by
an
hundred
thousand
singe
so
wondrous
merrily
and
well
now
had
this
phoebus
in
his
house
a
wife
which
that
he
loved
more
than
his
life
and
night
and
day
did
ever
his
diligence
her
for
to
please
and
do
her
reverence
save
only
if
that
i
the
sooth
shall
sayn
jealous
he
was
and
would
have
kept
her
fain
for
him
were
loth
for
to
be
deceived
and
so
is
every
wight
in
such
degree
but
all
for
nought
for
it
availeth
nought
a
good
wife
that
is
clean
of
work
and
thought
should
not
be
kept
in
none
certain
and
truely
the
labour
is
in
vain
to
keep
a
shrewe
for
it
will
not
be
woman
this
hold
i
for
a
very
nicety
folly
to
labour
for
to
keepe
wives
thus
writen
olde
clerkes
in
their
lives
but
now
to
purpose
as
i
first
began
this
worthy
phoebus
did
all
that
he
can
to
please
her
weening
through
such
pleasance
and
for
his
manhood
and
his
governance
that
no
man
should
have
put
him
from
her
grace
but
god
it
wot
there
may
no
man
embrace
as
to
a
thing
which
that
nature
in
constraining
hath
naturally
set
in
a
creature
take
any
bird
and
put
it
in
a
cage
and
do
all
thine
intent
and
thy
corage
thy
heart
prompts
to
foster
it
tenderly
with
meat
and
drink
of
alle
dainties
that
thou
canst
bethink
and
keep
it
all
so
cleanly
as
thou
may
although
the
cage
of
gold
be
never
so
gay
yet
had
this
bird
by
twenty
thousand
fold
in
a
forest
both
wild
and
cold
go
eate
wormes
and
such
wretchedness
for
ever
this
bird
will
do
his
business
out
of
his
cage
when
that
he
may
his
liberty
the
bird
desireth
aye
let
take
a
cat
and
foster
her
with
milk
and
tender
flesh
and
make
her
couch
of
silk
and
let
her
see
a
mouse
go
by
the
wall
anon
she
milk
and
flesh
and
all
and
every
dainty
that
is
in
that
house
such
appetite
hath
she
to
eat
the
mouse
lo
here
hath
her
domination
and
appetite
discretion
out
a
hath
also
a
villain
kind
the
lewedeste
wolf
that
she
may
find
or
least
of
reputation
will
she
take
in
time
when
to
have
a
make
desires
all
these
examples
speak
i
these
men
reference
to
that
be
untrue
and
nothing
by
women
for
men
have
ever
a
appetite
on
lower
things
to
perform
their
delight
than
on
their
wives
be
they
never
so
fair
never
so
true
nor
so
debonair
mild
flesh
is
so
newefangled
mischance
luck
to
that
we
can
in
no
thinge
have
pleasance
that
virtue
any
while
with
this
phoebus
which
that
thought
upon
no
guile
deceived
was
for
all
his
jollity
for
under
him
another
hadde
she
a
man
of
little
reputation
nought
worth
to
phoebus
in
comparison
the
more
harm
is
it
happens
often
so
of
which
there
cometh
muche
harm
and
woe
and
so
befell
when
phoebus
was
absent
his
wife
anon
hath
for
her
sent
lover
her
leman
certes
that
is
a
knavish
speech
forgive
it
me
and
that
i
you
beseech
the
wise
plato
saith
as
ye
may
read
the
word
must
needs
accorde
with
the
deed
if
men
shall
telle
properly
a
thing
the
word
must
cousin
be
to
the
working
i
am
a
man
right
thus
i
say
downright
there
is
no
difference
truely
betwixt
a
wife
that
is
of
high
degree
if
of
her
body
dishonest
she
be
and
any
poore
wench
other
than
this
if
it
so
be
they
worke
both
amiss
but
the
gentle
is
in
estate
above
she
shall
be
call
his
lady
and
his
love
and
for
that
other
is
a
poor
woman
she
shall
be
call
his
wench
and
his
leman
and
god
it
wot
mine
owen
deare
brother
men
lay
the
one
as
low
as
lies
the
other
right
so
betwixt
a
and
an
outlaw
or
else
a
thief
errant
the
same
i
say
there
is
no
difference
to
alexander
told
was
this
sentence
but
for
the
tyrant
is
of
greater
might
by
force
of
for
to
slay
downright
and
burn
both
house
and
home
and
make
all
plain
lo
therefore
is
he
call
a
capitain
and
for
the
outlaw
hath
but
small
meinie
and
may
not
do
so
great
an
harm
as
he
nor
bring
a
country
to
so
great
mischief
men
calle
him
an
outlaw
or
a
thief
but
for
i
am
a
man
not
textuel
in
texts
i
will
not
tell
of
texts
never
a
deal
i
will
go
to
my
tale
as
i
began
when
phoebus
wife
had
sent
for
her
leman
anon
they
wroughten
all
their
volage
or
rash
this
white
crow
that
hung
aye
in
the
cage
beheld
their
work
and
said
never
a
word
and
when
that
home
was
come
phoebus
the
lord
this
crowe
sung
cuckoo
cuckoo
cuckoo
what
bird
quoth
phoebus
what
song
thou
now
wert
thou
not
wont
so
merrily
to
sing
that
to
my
heart
it
was
a
rejoicing
to
hear
thy
voice
alas
what
song
is
this
by
god
quoth
he
i
singe
not
amiss
phoebus
quoth
he
for
all
thy
worthiness
for
all
thy
beauty
and
all
thy
gentleness
for
all
thy
song
and
all
thy
minstrelsy
all
thy
waiting
bleared
is
thine
all
thy
watching
with
one
of
little
reputation
thou
art
not
worth
to
thee
as
in
comparison
the
of
a
gnat
so
may
i
thrive
for
on
thy
bed
thy
wife
i
saw
him
swive
what
will
ye
more
the
crow
anon
him
told
by
tokens
and
by
wordes
bold
trustworthy
how
that
his
wife
had
done
her
lechery
to
his
great
shame
and
his
great
villainy
and
told
him
oft

saw
it
with
his
eyen

woeful
hearte
burst
in
two
his
bow
he
bent
and
set
therein
a
flo
and
in
his
ire
he
hath
his
wife
slain
this
is
th
effect
there
is
no
more
to
sayn
for
sorrow
of
which
he
brake
his
minstrelsy
both
harp
and
lute
and
psaltery
and
eke
he
brake
his
arrows
and
his
bow
and
after
that
thus
spake
he
to
the
crow
traitor
quoth
he
with
tongue
of
scorpion

hast
me
brought
to
my
confusion
alas

right
good

this

for

that

therefore
i
make
a
protestation
that
i
will
stande
to
correction
upon
this
word
we
have
assented
soon
for
as
us
seemed
it
was
to
thing
worth
to

in
some
virtuous
sentence
and
for
to
give
him
space
and
audience
and
bade
our

a
contemptuous
reference
to
the
alliterative
poetry
which
was
at
that
time
very
popular
in
preference
even
it
would
seem
to
rhyme
in
the
northern
parts
of
the
country
where
the
language
was
much
more
barbarous
and
unpolished
than
in

the
parson
begins
his
little
treatise
which
if
given
at
length
would
extend
to
about
thirty
of
these
pages
and
which
can
not
by
any
stretch
of
courtesy
or

said

to
woman
that
through
sin
hath
misgone
from
the
right
way
of
jerusalem
celestial
and
this
way
is
called
penitence
of
which
men
should
gladly
hearken
and
inquire
with
all
their
hearts
to
wit
what
is
penitence
and
whence
it
is
called
penitence
and
in
what
manner
and
in
how
many
manners
be
the
actions
or
workings
of
penitence
and
how
many
species
there
be
of
penitences
and
what
things
appertain
and
behove
to
penitence
and
what
things
disturb
penitence
penitence
is
described
on
the
authority
of
saints
ambrose
isidore
and
gregory
as
the
bewailing
of
sin
that
has
been
wrought
with
the
purpose
never
again
to
do
that
thing
or
any
other
thing
which
a
man
should
bewail
for
weeping
and
not
ceasing
to
do
the
sin
will
not
avail
though
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
after
every
time
that
a
man
falls
be
it
ever
so
often
he
may
find
grace
to
arise
through
penitence
and
repentant
folk
that
leave
their
sin
ere
sin
leave
them
are
accounted
by
holy
church
sure
of
their
salvation
even
though
the
repentance
be
at
the
last
hour
there
are
three
actions
of
penitence
that
a
man
be
baptized
after
he
has
sinned
that
he
do
no
deadly
sin
after
receiving
baptism
and
that
he
fall
into
no
venial
sins
from
day
to
day
thereof
saith
st
augustine
that
penitence
of
good
and
humble
folk
is
the
penitence
of
every
day
the
species
of
penitence
are
three
solemn
when
a
man
is
openly
expelled
from
holy
church
in
lent
or
is
compelled
by
holy
church
to
do
open
penance
for
an
open
sin
openly
talked
of
in
the
country
common
penance
enjoined
by
priests
in
certain
cases
as
to
go
on
pilgrimage
naked
or
barefoot
and
privy
penance
which
men
do
daily
for
private
sins
of
which
they
confess
privately
and
receive
private
penance
to
very
perfect
penitence
are
behoveful
and
necessary
three
things
contrition
of
heart
confession
of
mouth
and
satisfaction
which
are
fruitful
penitence
against
delight
in
thinking
reckless
speech
and
wicked
sinful
works
penitence
may
be
likened
to
a
tree
having
its
root
in
contrition
biding
itself
in
the
heart
as
a
does
in
the
earth
out
of
this
root
springs
a
stalk
that
bears
branches
and
leaves
of
confession
and
fruit
of
satisfaction
of
this
root
also
springs
a
seed
of
grace
which
is
mother
of
all
security
and
this
seed
is
eager
and
hot
and
the
grace
of
this
seed
springs
of
god
through
remembrance
on
the
day
of
judgment
and
on
the
pains
of
hell
the
heat
of
this
seed
is
the
love
of
god
and
the
desire
of
everlasting
joy
and
this
heat
draws
the
heart
of
man
to
god
and
makes
him
hate
his
sin
penance
is
the
tree
of
life
to
them
that
receive
it
in
penance
or
contrition
man
shall
understand
four
things
what
is
contrition
what
are
the
causes
that
move
a
man
to
contrition
how
he
should
be
contrite
and
what
contrition
availeth
to
the
soul
contrition
is
the
heavy
and
grievous
sorrow
that
a
man
receiveth
in
his
heart
for
his
sins
with
earnest
purpose
to
confess
and
do
penance
and
never
more
to
sin
six
causes
ought
to
move
a
man
to
contrition
he
should
remember
him
of
his
sins
he
should
reflect
that
sin
putteth
a
man
in
great
thraldom
and
all
the
greater
the
higher
is
the
estate
from
which
he
falls
he
should
dread
the
day
of
doom
and
the
horrible
pains
of
hell
the
sorrowful
remembrance
of
the
good
deeds
that
man
hath
omitted
to
do
here
on
earth
and
also
the
good
that
he
hath
lost
ought
to
make
him
have
contrition
so
also
ought
the
remembrance
of
the
passion
that
our
lord
jesus
christ
suffered
for
our
sins
and
so
ought
the
hope
of
three
things
that
is
to
say
forgiveness
of
sin
the
gift
of
grace
to
do
well
and
the
glory
of
heaven
with
which
god
shall
reward
man
for
his
good
deeds
all
these
points
the
parson
illustrates
and
enforces
at
length
waxing
especially
eloquent
under
the
third
head
and
plainly
setting
forth
the
sternly
realistic
notions
regarding
future
punishments
that
were
entertained
in
the
time
of
chaucer
certes
all
the
sorrow
that
a
man
might
make
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
is
but
a
little
thing
at
retard
of
in
comparison
with
the
sorrow
of
hell
the
cause
why
that
job
calleth
hell
the
land
of
darkness
understand
that
he
calleth
it
land
or
earth
for
it
is
stable
and
never
shall
fail
and
dark
for
he
that
is
in
hell
hath
default
is
devoid
of
light
natural
for
certes
the
dark
light
that
shall
come
out
of
the
fire
that
ever
shall
burn
shall
turn
them
all
to
pain
that
be
in
hell
for
it
sheweth
them
the
horrible
devils
that
them
torment
covered
with
the
darkness
of
death
that
is
to
say
that
he
that
is
in
hell
shall
have
default
of
the
sight
of
god
for
certes
the
sight
of
god
is
the
life
perdurable
everlasting
the
darkness
of
death
be
the
sins
that
the
wretched
man
hath
done
which
that
disturb
prevent
him
to
see
the
face
of
god
right
as
a
dark
cloud
doth
between
us
and
the
sun
land
of
misease
because
there
be
three
manner
of
defaults
against
three
things
that
folk
of
this
world
have
in
this
present
life
that
is
to
say
honours
delights
and
riches
against
honour
have
they
in
hell
shame
and
confusion
for
well
ye
wot
that
men
call
honour
the
reverence
that
man
doth
to
man
but
in
hell
is
no
honour
nor
reverence
for
certes
no
more
reverence
shall
be
done
there
to
a
king
than
to
a
knave
servant
for
which
god
saith
by
the
prophet
jeremiah
the
folk
that
me
despise
shall
be
in
despite
honour
is
also
called
great
lordship
there
shall
no
wight
serve
other
but
of
harm
and
torment
honour
is
also
called
great
dignity
and
highness
but
in
hell
shall
they
be
all
fortrodden
trampled
under
foot
of
devils
as
god
saith
the
horrible
devils
shall
go
and
come
upon
the
heads
of
damned
folk
and
this
is
forasmuch
as
the
higher
that
they
were
in
this
present
life
the
more
shall
they
be
abated
abased
and
defouled
in
hell
against
the
riches
of
this
world
shall
they
have
misease
trouble
torment
of
poverty
and
this
poverty
shall
be
in
four
things
in
default
want
of
treasure
of
which
david
saith
the
rich
folk
that
embraced
and
oned
united
all
their
heart
to
treasure
of
this
world
shall
sleep
in
the
sleeping
of
death
and
nothing
shall
they
find
in
their
hands
of
all
their
treasure
and
moreover
the
misease
of
hell
shall
be
in
default
of
meat
and
drink
for
god
saith
thus
by
moses
they
shall
be
wasted
with
hunger
and
the
birds
of
hell
shall
devour
them
with
bitter
death
and
the
gall
of
the
dragon
shall
be
their
drink
and
the
venom
of
the
dragon
their
morsels
and
furthermore
their
misease
shall
be
in
default
of
clothing
for
they
shall
be
naked
in
body
as
of
clothing
save
the
fire
in
which
they
burn
and
other
filths
and
naked
shall
they
be
in
soul
of
all
manner
virtues
which
that
is
the
clothing
of
the
soul
where
be
then
the
gay
robes
and
the
soft
sheets
and
the
fine
shirts
lo
what
saith
of
them
the
prophet
isaiah
that
under
them
shall
be
strewed
moths
and
their
covertures
shall
be
of
worms
of
hell
and
furthermore
their
misease
shall
be
in
default
of
friends
for
he
is
not
poor
that
hath
good
friends
but
there
is
no
friend
for
neither
god
nor
any
good
creature
shall
be
friend
to
them
and
evereach
of
them
shall
hate
other
with
deadly
hate
the
sons
and
the
daughters
shall
rebel
against
father
and
mother
and
kindred
against
kindred
and
chide
and
despise
each
other
both
day
and
night
as
god
saith
by
the
prophet
micah
and
the
loving
children
that
whom
loved
so
fleshly
each
other
would
each
of
them
eat
the
other
if
they
might
for
how
should
they
love
together
in
the
pains
of
hell
when
they
hated
each
other
in
the
prosperity
of
this
life
for
trust
well
their
fleshly
love
was
deadly
hate
as
saith
the
prophet
david
whoso
loveth
wickedness
he
hateth
his
own
soul
and
whoso
hateth
his
own
soul
certes
he
may
love
none
other
wight
in
no
manner
and
therefore
in
hell
is
no
solace
nor
no
friendship
but
ever
the
more
kindreds
that
be
in
hell
the
more
cursing
the
more
chiding
and
the
more
deadly
hate
there
is
among
them
and
furtherover
they
shall
have
default
of
all
manner
delights
for
certes
delights
be
after
the
appetites
of
the
five
wits
senses
as
sight
hearing
smelling
savouring
tasting
and
touching
but
in
hell
their
sight
shall
be
full
of
darkness
and
of
smoke
and
their
eyes
full
of
tears
and
their
hearing
full
of
waimenting
lamenting
and
grinting
gnashing
of
teeth
as
saith
jesus
christ
their
nostrils
shall
be
full
of
stinking
and
as
saith
isaiah
the
prophet
their
savouring
tasting
shall
be
full
of
bitter
gall
and
touching
of
all
their
body
shall
be
covered
with
fire
that
never
shall
quench
and
with
worms
that
never
shall
die
as
god
saith
by
the
mouth
of
isaiah
and
forasmuch
as
they
shall
not
ween
that
they
may
die
for
pain
and
by
death
flee
from
pain
that
may
they
understand
in
the
word
of
job
that
saith
there
is
the
shadow
of
death
certes
a
shadow
hath
the
likeness
of
the
thing
of
which
it
is
shadowed
but
the
shadow
is
not
the
same
thing
of
which
it
is
shadowed
right
so
fareth
the
pain
of
hell
it
is
like
death
for
the
horrible
anguish
and
why
for
it
paineth
them
ever
as
though
they
should
die
anon
but
certes
they
shall
not
die
for
as
saith
saint
gregory
to
wretched
caitiffs
shall
be
given
death
without
death
and
end
without
end
and
default
without
failing
for
their
death
shall
always
live
and
their
end
shall
evermore
begin
and
their
default
shall
never
fail
and
therefore
saith
saint
john
the
evangelist
they
shall
follow
death
and
they
shall
not
find
him
and
they
shall
desire
to
die
and
death
shall
flee
from
them
and
eke
job
saith
that
in
hell
is
no
order
of
rule
and
albeit
that
god
hath
created
all
things
in
right
order
and
nothing
without
order
but
all
things
be
ordered
and
numbered
yet
nevertheless
they
that
be
damned
be
not
in
order
nor
hold
no
order
for
the
earth
shall
bear
them
no
fruit
for
as
the
prophet
david
saith
god
shall
destroy
the
fruit
of
the
earth
as
for
them
nor
water
shall
give
them
no
moisture
nor
the
air
no
refreshing
nor
the
fire
no
light
for
as
saith
saint
basil
the
burning
of
the
fire
of
this
world
shall
god
give
in
hell
to
them
that
be
damned
but
the
light
and
the
clearness
shall
be
given
in
heaven
to
his
children
right
as
the
good
man
giveth
flesh
to
his
children
and
bones
to
his
hounds
and
for
they
shall
have
no
hope
to
escape
saith
job
at
last
that
there
shall
horror
and
grisly
dread
dwell
without
end
horror
is
always
dread
of
harm
that
is
to
come
and
this
dread
shall
ever
dwell
in
the
hearts
of
them
that
be
damned
and
therefore
have
they
lost
all
their
hope
for
seven
causes
first
for
god
that
is
their
judge
shall
be
without
mercy
to
them
nor
they
may
not
please
him
nor
none
of
his
hallows
saints
nor
they
may
give
nothing
for
their
ransom
nor
they
have
no
voice
to
speak
to
him
nor
they
may
not
flee
from
pain
nor
they
have
no
goodness
in
them
that
they
may
shew
to
deliver
them
from
pain
under
the
fourth
head
of
good
works
the
parson
says
the
courteous
lord
jesus
christ
will
that
no
good
work
be
lost
for
in
somewhat
it
shall
avail
but
forasmuch
as
the
good
works
that
men
do
while
they
be
in
good
life
be
all
amortised
killed
deadened
by
sin
following
and
also
since
all
the
good
works
that
men
do
while
they
be
in
deadly
sin
be
utterly
dead
as
for
to
have
the
life
perdurable
everlasting
well
may
that
man
that
no
good
works
doth
sing
that
new
french
song
tout
perdu
mon
temps
et
mon
labour
for
certes
sin
bereaveth
a
man
both
the
goodness
of
nature
and
eke
the
goodness
of
grace
for
soothly
the
grace
of
the
holy
ghost
fareth
like
fire
that
may
not
be
idle
for
fire
faileth
anon
as
it
forleteth
leaveth
its
working
and
right
so
grace
faileth
anon
as
it
forleteth
its
working
then
loseth
the
sinful
man
the
goodness
of
glory
that
only
is
to
good
men
that
labour
and
work
well
may
he
be
sorry
then
that
oweth
all
his
life
to
god
as
long
as
he
hath
lived
and
also
as
long
as
he
shall
live
that
no
goodness
hath
to
pay
with
his
debt
to
god
to
whom
he
oweth
all
his
life
for
trust
well
he
shall
give
account
as
saith
saint
bernard
of
all
the
goods
that
have
been
given
him
in
his
present
life
and
how
he
hath
them
dispended
insomuch
that
there
shall
not
perish
an
hair
of
his
head
nor
a
moment
of
an
hour
shall
not
perish
of
his
time
that
he
shall
not
give
thereof
a
reckoning
having
treated
of
the
causes
the
parson
comes
to
the
manner
of
contrition
which
should
be
universal
and
total
not
merely
of
outward
deeds
of
sin
but
also
of
wicked
delights
and
thoughts
and
words
for
certes
almighty
god
is
all
good
and
therefore
either
he
forgiveth
all
or
else
right
naught
further
contrition
should
be
wonder
sorrowful
and
anguishous
and
also
continual
with
steadfast
purpose
of
confession
and
amendment
lastly
of
what
contrition
availeth
the
parson
says
that
sometimes
it
delivereth
man
from
sin
that
without
it
neither
confession
nor
satisfaction
is
of
any
worth
that
it
destroyeth
the
prison
of
hell
and
maketh
weak
and
feeble
all
the
strengths
of
the
devils
and
restoreth
the
gifts
of
the
holy
ghost
and
of
all
good
virtues
and
cleanseth
the
soul
of
sin
and
delivereth
it
from
the
pain
of
hell
and
from
the
company
of
the
devil
and
from
the
servage
slavery
of
sin
and
restoreth
it
to
all
goods
spiritual
and
to
the
company
and
communion
of
holy
church
he
who
should
set
his
intent
to
these
things
would
no
longer
be
inclined
to
sin
but
would
give
his
heart
and
body
to
the
service
of
jesus
christ
and
thereof
do
him
homage
for
certes
our
lord
jesus
christ
hath
spared
us
so
benignly
in
our
follies
that
if
he
had
not
pity
on
man
soul
a
sorry
song
might
we
all
sing
the
second
part
of
the
parson
tale
or
treatise
opens
with
an
explanation
of
what
is
confession
which
is
termed
the
second
part
of
penitence
that
is
sign
of
contrition
whether
it
ought
needs
be
done
or
not
and
what
things
be
convenable
to
true
confession
confession
is
true
shewing
of
sins
to
the
priest
without
excusing
hiding
or
forwrapping
disguising
of
anything
and
without
vaunting
of
good
works
also
it
is
necessary
to
understand
whence
that
sins
spring
and
how
they
increase
and
which
they
be
from
adam
we
took
original
sin
from
him
fleshly
descended
be
we
all
and
engendered
of
vile
and
corrupt
matter
and
the
penalty
of
adam
transgression
dwelleth
with
us
as
to
temptation
which
penalty
is
called
concupiscence
this
concupiscence
when
it
is
wrongfully
disposed
or
ordained
in
a
man
it
maketh
him
covet
by
covetise
of
flesh
fleshly
sin
by
sight
of
his
eyes
as
to
earthly
things
and
also
covetise
of
highness
by
pride
of
heart
the
parson
proceeds
to
shew
how
man
is
tempted
in
his
flesh
to
sin
how
after
his
natural
concupiscence
comes
suggestion
of
the
devil
that
is
to
say
the
devil
bellows
with
which
he
bloweth
in
man
the
fire
of
con
cupiscence
and
how
man
then
bethinketh
him
whether
he
will
do
or
no
the
thing
to
which
he
is
tempted
if
he
flame
up
into
pleasure
at
the
thought
and
give
way
then
is
he
all
dead
in
soul
and
thus
is
sin
accomplished
by
temptation
by
delight
and
by
consenting
and
then
is
the
sin
actual
sin
is
either
venial
or
deadly
deadly
when
a
man
loves
any
creature
more
than
jesus
christ
our
creator
venial
if
he
love
jesus
christ
less
than
he
ought
venial
sins
diminish
man
love
to
god
more
and
more
and
may
in
this
wise
skip
into
deadly
sin
for
many
small
make
a
great
and
hearken
this
example
a
great
wave
of
the
sea
cometh
sometimes
with
so
great
a
violence
that
it
drencheth
causes
to
sink
the
ship
and
the
same
harm
do
sometimes
the
small
drops
of
water
that
enter
through
a
little
crevice
in
the
thurrok
hold
bilge
and
in
the
bottom
of
the
ship
if
men
be
so
negligent
that
they
discharge
them
not
betimes
and
therefore
although
there
be
difference
betwixt
these
two
causes
of
drenching
algates
in
any
case
the
ship
is
dreint
sunk
right
so
fareth
it
sometimes
of
deadly
sin
and
of
venial
sins
when
they
multiply
in
a
man
so
greatly
as
to
make
him
love
worldly
things
more
than
god
the
parson
then
enumerates
specially
a
number
of
sins
which
many
a
man
peradventure
deems
no
sins
and
confesses
them
not
and
yet
nevertheless
they
are
truly
sins
this
is
to
say
at
every
time
that
a
man
eateth
and
drinketh
more
than
sufficeth
to
the
sustenance
of
his
body
in
certain
he
doth
sin
eke
when
he
speaketh
more
than
it
needeth
he
doth
sin
eke
when
he
heareth
not
benignly
the
complaint
of
the
poor
eke
when
he
is
in
health
of
body
and
will
not
fast
when
other
folk
fast
without
cause
reasonable
eke
when
he
sleepeth
more
than
needeth
or
when
he
cometh
by
that
occasion
too
late
to
church
or
to
other
works
of
charity
eke
when
he
useth
his
wife
without
sovereign
desire
of
engendrure
to
the
honour
of
god
or
for
the
intent
to
yield
his
wife
his
debt
of
his
body
eke
when
he
will
not
visit
the
sick
or
the
prisoner
if
he
may
eke
if
he
love
wife
or
child
or
other
worldly
thing
more
than
reason
requireth
eke
if
he
flatter
or
blandish
more
than
he
ought
for
any
necessity
eke
if
he
minish
or
withdraw
the
alms
of
the
poor
eke
if
he
apparail
prepare
his
meat
more
deliciously
than
need
is
or
eat
it
too
hastily
by
likerousness
gluttony
eke
if
he
talk
vanities
in
the
church
or
at
god
service
or
that
he
be
a
talker
of
idle
words
of
folly
or
villainy
for
he
shall
yield
account
of
them
at
the
day
of
doom
eke
when
he
behighteth
promiseth
or
assureth
to
do
things
that
he
may
not
perform
eke
when
that
by
lightness
of
folly
he
missayeth
or
scorneth
his
neighbour
eke
when
he
hath
any
wicked
suspicion
of
thing
that
he
wot
of
it
no
soothfastness
these
things
and
more
without
number
be
sins
as
saith
saint
augustine
no
earthly
man
may
eschew
all
venial
sins
yet
may
he
refrain
him
by
the
burning
love
that
he
hath
to
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
by
prayer
and
confession
and
other
good
works
so
that
it
shall
but
little
grieve
furthermore
men
may
also
refrain
and
put
away
venial
sin
by
receiving
worthily
the
precious
body
of
jesus
christ
by
receiving
eke
of
holy
water
by
by
general
confession
of
confiteor
at
mass
and
at
prime
and
at
compline
evening
service
and
by
blessing
of
bishops
and
priests
and
by
other
good
works
the
parson
then
proceeds
to
weightier
matters
now
it
is
behovely
profitable
necessary
to
tell
which
be
deadly
sins
that
is
to
say
chieftains
of
sins
forasmuch
as
all
they
run
in
one
leash
but
in
diverse
manners
now
be
they
called
chieftains
forasmuch
as
they
be
chief
and
of
them
spring
all
other
sins
the
root
of
these
sins
then
is
pride
the
general
root
of
all
harms
for
of
this
root
spring
certain
branches
as
ire
envy
accidie
or
sloth
avarice
or
covetousness
to
common
understanding
gluttony
and
lechery
and
each
of
these
sins
hath
his
branches
and
his
twigs
as
shall
be
declared
in
their
chapters
following
and
though
so
be
that
no
man
can
tell
utterly
the
number
of
the
twigs
and
of
the
harms
that
come
of
pride
yet
will
i
shew
a
part
of
them
as
ye
shall
understand
there
is
inobedience
vaunting
hypocrisy
despite
arrogance
impudence
swelling
of
hearte
insolence
elation
impatience
strife
contumacy
presumption
irreverence
pertinacity
glory
and
many
another
twig
that
i
can
not
tell
nor
declare
and
yet
moreover
there
is
a
privy
species
of
pride
that
waiteth
first
to
be
saluted
ere
he
will
salute
all
although
be
he
less
worthy
than
that
other
is
and
eke
he
waiteth
expecteth
or
desireth
to
sit
or
to
go
above
him
in
the
way
or
kiss
the
pax
or
be
incensed
or
go
to
offering
before
his
neighbour
and
such
semblable
like
things
against
his
duty
peradventure
but
that
he
hath
his
heart
and
his
intent
in
such
a
proud
desire
to
be
magnified
and
honoured
before
the
people
now
be
there
two
manner
of
prides
the
one
of
them
is
within
the
heart
of
a
man
and
the
other
is
without
of
which
soothly
these
foresaid
things
and
more
than
i
have
said
appertain
to
pride
that
is
within
the
heart
of
a
man
and
there
be
other
species
of
pride
that
be
without
but
nevertheless
the
one
of
these
species
of
pride
is
sign
of
the
other
right
as
the
gay
levesell
bush
at
the
tavern
is
sign
of
the
wine
that
is
in
the
cellar
and
this
is
in
many
things
as
in
speech
and
countenance
and
outrageous
array
of
clothing
for
certes
if
there
had
been
no
sin
in
clothing
christ
would
not
so
soon
have
noted
and
spoken
of
the
clothing
of
that
rich
man
in
the
gospel
and
saint
gregory
saith
that
precious
clothing
is
culpable
for
the
dearth
dearness
of
it
and
for
its
softness
and
for
its
strangeness
and
disguising
and
for
the
superfluity
or
for
the
inordinate
scantness
of
it
alas
may
not
a
man
see
in
our
days
the
sinful
costly
array
of
clothing
and
namely
specially
in
too
much
superfluity
or
else
in
too
disordinate
scantness
as
to
the
first
sin
in
superfluity
of
clothing
which
that
maketh
it
so
dear
to
the
harm
of
the
people
not
only
the
cost
of
the
embroidering
the
disguising
indenting
or
barring
ounding
paling
winding
or
banding
and
semblable
similar
waste
of
cloth
in
vanity
but
there
is
also
the
costly
furring
lining
or
edging
with
fur
in
their
gowns
so
much
punching
of
chisels
to
make
holes
so
much
dagging
cutting
of
shears
with
the
superfluity
in
length
of
the
foresaid
gowns
trailing
in
the
dung
and
in
the
mire
on
horse
and
eke
on
foot
as
well
of
man
as
of
woman
that
all
that
trailing
is
verily
as
in
effect
wasted
consumed
threadbare
and
rotten
with
dung
rather
than
it
is
given
to
the
poor
to
great
damage
of
the
foresaid
poor
folk
and
that
in
sundry
wise
this
is
to
say
the
more
that
cloth
is
wasted
the
more
must
it
cost
to
the
poor
people
for
the
scarceness
and
furthermore
if
so
be
that
they
would
give
such
punched
and
dagged
clothing
to
the
poor
people
it
is
not
convenient
to
wear
for
their
estate
nor
sufficient
to
boot
help
remedy
their
necessity
to
keep
them
from
the
distemperance
inclemency
of
the
firmament
upon
the
other
side
to
speak
of
the
horrible
disordinate
scantness
of
clothing
as
be
these
cutted
slops
or
hanselines
breeches
that
through
their
shortness
cover
not
the
shameful
member
of
man
to
wicked
intent
alas
some
of
them
shew
the
boss
and
the
shape
of
the
horrible
swollen
members
that
seem
like
to
the
malady
of
hernia
in
the
wrapping
of
their
hosen
and
eke
the
buttocks
of
them
that
fare
as
it
were
the
hinder
part
of
a
in
the
full
of
the
moon
and
more
over
the
wretched
swollen
members
that
they
shew
through
disguising
in
departing
dividing
of
their
hosen
in
white
and
red
seemeth
that
half
their
shameful
privy
members
were
flain
flayed
and
if
so
be
that
they
depart
their
hosen
in
other
colours
as
is
white
and
blue
or
white
and
black
or
black
and
red
and
so
forth
then
seemeth
it
by
variance
of
colour
that
the
half
part
of
their
privy
members
be
corrupt
by
the
fire
of
saint
anthony
or
by
canker
or
other
such
mischance
and
of
the
hinder
part
of
their
buttocks
it
is
full
horrible
to
see
for
certes
in
that
part
of
their
body
where
they
purge
their
stinking
ordure
that
foul
part
shew
they
to
the
people
proudly
in
despite
of
honesty
decency
which
honesty
jesus
christ
and
his
friends
observed
to
shew
in
his
life
now
as
of
the
outrageous
array
of
women
god
wot
that
though
the
visages
of
some
of
them
seem
full
chaste
and
debonair
gentle
yet
notify
they
in
their
array
of
attire
likerousness
and
pride
i
say
not
that
honesty
reasonable
and
appropriate
style
in
clothing
of
man
or
woman
unconvenable
but
certes
the
superfluity
or
disordinate
scarcity
of
clothing
is
reprovable
also
the
sin
of
their
ornament
or
of
apparel
as
in
things
that
appertain
to
riding
as
in
too
many
delicate
horses
that
be
holden
for
delight
that
be
so
fair
fat
and
costly
and
also
in
many
a
vicious
knave
servant
that
is
sustained
because
of
them
in
curious
harness
as
in
saddles
cruppers
peytrels
and
bridles
covered
with
precious
cloth
and
rich
bars
and
plates
of
gold
and
silver
for
which
god
saith
by
zechariah
the
prophet
i
will
confound
the
riders
of
such
horses
these
folk
take
little
regard
of
the
riding
of
god
son
of
heaven
and
of
his
harness
when
he
rode
upon
an
ass
and
had
no
other
harness
but
the
poor
clothes
of
his
disciples
nor
we
read
not
that
ever
he
rode
on
any
other
beast
i
speak
this
for
the
sin
of
superfluity
and
not
for
reasonable
honesty
seemliness
when
reason
it
requireth
and
moreover
certes
pride
is
greatly
notified
in
holding
of
great
meinie
retinue
of
servants
when
they
be
of
little
profit
or
of
right
no
profit
and
namely
especially
when
that
meinie
is
felonous
violent
and
damageous
harmful
to
the
people
by
hardiness
arrogance
of
high
lordship
or
by
way
of
office
for
certes
such
lords
sell
then
their
lordship
to
the
devil
of
hell
when
they
sustain
the
wickedness
of
their
meinie
or
else
when
these
folk
of
low
degree
as
they
that
hold
hostelries
sustain
theft
of
their
hostellers
and
that
is
in
many
manner
of
deceits
that
manner
of
folk
be
the
flies
that
follow
the
honey
or
else
the
hounds
that
follow
the
carrion
such
foresaid
folk
strangle
spiritually
their
lordships
for
which
thus
saith
david
the
prophet
wicked
death
may
come
unto
these
lordships
and
god
give
that
they
may
descend
into
hell
adown
for
in
their
houses
is
iniquity
and
shrewedness
impiety
and
not
god
of
heaven
and
certes
but
if
unless
they
do
amendment
right
as
god
gave
his
benison
blessing
to
laban
by
the
service
of
jacob
and
to
pharaoh
by
the
service
of
joseph
right
so
god
will
give
his
malison
condemnation
to
such
lordships
as
sustain
the
wickedness
of
their
servants
but
unless
they
come
to
amendment
pride
of
the
table
apaireth
worketh
harm
eke
full
oft
for
certes
rich
men
be
called
to
feasts
and
poor
folk
be
put
away
and
rebuked
also
in
excess
of
divers
meats
and
drinks
and
namely
specially
such
manner
and
burning
of
wild
fire
and
painted
and
castled
with
paper
and
semblable
similar
waste
so
that
it
is
abuse
to
think
and
eke
in
too
great
preciousness
of
vessel
plate
and
curiosity
of
minstrelsy
by
which
a
man
is
stirred
more
to
the
delights
of
luxury
if
so
be
that
he
set
his
heart
the
less
upon
our
lord
jesus
christ
certain
it
is
a
sin
and
certainly
the
delights
might
be
so
great
in
this
case
that
a
man
might
lightly
easily
fall
by
them
into
deadly
sin
the
sins
that
arise
of
pride
advisedly
and
habitually
are
deadly
those
that
arise
by
frailty
unadvised
suddenly
and
suddenly
withdraw
again
though
grievous
are
not
deadly
pride
itself
springs
sometimes
of
the
goods
of
nature
sometimes
of
the
goods
of
fortune
sometimes
of
the
goods
of
grace
but
the
parson
enumerating
and
examining
all
these
in
turn
points
out
how
little
security
they
possess
and
how
little
ground
for
pride
they
furnish
and
goes
on
to
enforce
the
remedy
against
pride
which
is
humility
or
meekness
a
virtue
through
which
a
man
hath
true
knowledge
of
himself
and
holdeth
no
high
esteem
of
himself
in
regard
of
his
deserts
considering
ever
his
frailty
now
be
there
three
manners
kinds
of
humility
as
humility
in
heart
and
another
in
the
mouth
and
the
third
in
works
the
humility
in
the
heart
is
in
four
manners
the
one
is
when
a
man
holdeth
himself
as
nought
worth
before
god
of
heaven
the
second
is
when
he
despiseth
no
other
man
the
third
is
when
he
recketh
not
though
men
hold
him
nought
worth
the
fourth
is
when
he
is
not
sorry
of
his
humiliation
also
the
humility
of
mouth
is
in
four
things
in
temperate
speech
in
humility
of
speech
and
when
he
confesseth
with
his
own
mouth
that
he
is
such
as
he
thinketh
that
he
is
in
his
heart
another
is
when
he
praiseth
the
bounte
goodness
of
another
man
and
nothing
thereof
diminisheth
humility
eke
in
works
is
in
four
manners
the
first
is
when
he
putteth
other
men
before
him
the
second
is
to
choose
the
lowest
place
of
all
the
third
is
gladly
to
assent
to
good
counsel
the
fourth
is
to
stand
gladly
by
the
award
judgment
of
his
sovereign
or
of
him
that
is
higher
in
degree
certain
this
is
a
great
work
of
humility
the
parson
proceeds
to
treat
of
the
other
cardinal
sins
and
their
remedies
envy
with
its
remedy
the
love
of
god
principally
and
of
our
neighbours
as
ourselves
anger
with
all
its
fruits
in
revenge
rancour
hate
discord
manslaughter
blasphemy
swearing
falsehood
flattery
chiding
and
reproving
scorning
treachery
sowing
of
strife
doubleness
of
tongue
betraying
of
counsel
to
a
man
disgrace
menacing
idle
words
jangling
japery
or
buffoonery
and
its
remedy
in
the
virtues
called
mansuetude
debonairte
or
gentleness
and
patience
or
sufferance
sloth
or
accidie
which
comes
after
the
sin
of
anger
because
envy
blinds
the
eyes
of
a
man
and
anger
troubleth
a
man
and
sloth
maketh
him
heavy
thoughtful
and
peevish
it
is
opposed
to
every
estate
of
man
as
unfallen
and
held
to
work
in
praising
and
adoring
god
as
sinful
and
held
to
labour
in
praying
for
deliverance
from
sin
and
as
in
the
state
of
grace
and
held
to
works
of
penitence
it
resembles
the
heavy
and
sluggish
condition
of
those
in
hell
it
will
suffer
no
hardness
and
no
penance
it
prevents
any
beginning
of
good
works
it
causes
despair
of
god
mercy
which
is
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
it
induces
somnolency
and
neglect
of
communion
in
prayer
with
god
and
it
breeds
negligence
or
recklessness
that
cares
for
nothing
and
is
the
nurse
of
all
mischiefs
if
ignorance
is
their
mother
against
sloth
and
these
and
other
branches
and
fruits
of
it
the
remedy
lies
in
the
virtue
of
fortitude
or
strength
in
its
various
species
of
magnanimity
or
great
courage
faith
and
hope
in
god
and
his
saints
surety
or
sickerness
when
a
man
fears
nothing
that
can
oppose
the
good
works
he
has
under
taken
magnificence
when
he
carries
out
great
works
of
goodness
begun
constancy
or
stableness
of
heart
and
other
incentives
to
energy
and
laborious
service
avarice
or
covetousness
which
is
the
root
of
all
harms
since
its
votaries
are
idolaters
oppressors
and
enslavers
of
men
deceivers
of
their
equals
in
business
simoniacs
gamblers
liars
thieves
false
swearers
blasphemers
murderers
and
sacrilegious
its
remedy
lies
in
compassion
and
pity
largely
exercised
and
in
reasonable
liberality
for
those
who
spend
on
or
ostentation
of
worldly
estate
and
luxury
shall
receive
the
malison
condemnation
that
christ
shall
give
at
the
day
of
doom
to
them
that
shall
be
damned
gluttony
of
which
the
parson
treats
so
briefly
that
the
chapter
may
be
given
in
full
after
avarice
cometh
gluttony
which
is
express
against
the
commandment
of
god
gluttony
is
unmeasurable
appetite
to
eat
or
to
drink
or
else
to
do
in
aught
to
the
unmeasurable
appetite
and
disordered
covetousness
craving
to
eat
or
drink
this
sin
corrupted
all
this
world
as
is
well
shewed
in
the
sin
of
adam
and
of
eve
look
also
what
saith
saint
paul
of
gluttony
many
saith
he
go
of
which
i
have
oft
said
to
you
and
now
i
say
it
weeping
that
they
be
enemies
of
the
cross
of
christ
of
which
the
end
is
death
and
of
which
their
womb
stomach
is
their
god
and
their
glory
in
confusion
of
them
that
so
savour
take
delight
in
earthly
things
he
that
is
usant
accustomed
addicted
to
this
sin
of
gluttony
he
may
no
sin
withstand
he
must
be
in
servage
bondage
of
all
vices
for
it
is
the
hoard
lair
where
he
hideth
him
in
and
resteth
this
sin
hath
many
species
the
first
is
drunkenness
that
is
the
horrible
sepulture
of
man
reason
and
therefore
when
a
man
is
drunken
he
hath
lost
his
reason
and
this
is
deadly
sin
but
soothly
when
that
a
man
is
not
wont
to
strong
drink
and
peradventure
knoweth
not
the
strength
of
the
drink
or
hath
feebleness
in
his
head
or
hath
travailed
laboured
through
which
he
drinketh
the
more
all
although
be
he
suddenly
caught
with
drink
it
is
no
deadly
sin
but
venial
the
second
species
of
gluttony
is
that
the
spirit
of
a
man
waxeth
all
troubled
for
drunkenness
and
bereaveth
a
man
the
discretion
of
his
wit
the
third
species
of
gluttony
is
when
a
man
devoureth
his
meat
and
hath
no
rightful
manner
of
eating
the
fourth
is
when
through
the
great
abundance
of
his
meat
the
humours
of
his
body
be
distempered
the
fifth
is
forgetfulness
by
too
much
drinking
for
which
a
man
sometimes
forgetteth
by
the
morrow
what
be
did
at
eve
in
other
manner
be
distinct
the
species
of
gluttony
after
saint
gregory
the
first
is
for
to
eat
or
drink
before
time
the
second
is
when
a
man
getteth
him
too
delicate
meat
or
drink
the
third
is
when
men
take
too
much
over
measure
immoderately
the
fourth
is
curiosity
nicety
with
great
intent
application
pains
to
make
and
apparel
prepare
his
meat
the
fifth
is
for
to
eat
too
greedily
these
be
the
five
fingers
of
the
devil
hand
by
which
he
draweth
folk
to
the
sin
against
gluttony
the
remedy
is
abstinence
as
saith
galen
but
that
i
hold
not
meritorious
if
he
do
it
only
for
the
health
of
his
body
saint
augustine
will
that
abstinence
be
done
for
virtue
and
with
patience
abstinence
saith
he
is
little
worth
but
if
unless
a
man
have
good
will
thereto
and
but
it
be
enforced
by
patience
and
by
charity
and
that
men
do
it
for
god
sake
and
in
hope
to
have
the
bliss
in
heaven
the
fellows
of
abstinence
be
temperance
that
holdeth
the
mean
in
all
things
also
shame
that
escheweth
all
dishonesty
indecency
impropriety
sufficiency
that
seeketh
no
rich
meats
nor
drinks
nor
doth
no
force
of
sets
no
value
on
no
outrageous
apparelling
of
meat
measure
moderation
also
that
restraineth
by
reason
the
unmeasurable
appetite
of
eating
soberness
also
that
restraineth
the
outrage
of
drink
sparing
also
that
restraineth
the
delicate
ease
to
sit
long
at
meat
wherefore
some
folk
stand
of
their
own
will
to
eat
because
they
will
eat
at
less
leisure
at
great
length
the
parson
then
points
out
the
many
varieties
of
the
sin
of
lechery
and
its
remedy
in
chastity
and
continence
alike
in
marriage
and
in
widowhood
also
in
the
abstaining
from
all
such
indulgences
of
eating
drinking
and
sleeping
as
inflame
the
passions
and
from
the
company
of
all
who
may
tempt
to
the
sin
minute
guidance
is
given
as
to
the
duty
of
confessing
fully
and
faithfully
the
circumstances
that
attend
and
may
aggravate
this
sin
and
the
treatise
then
passes
to
the
consideration
of
the
conditions
that
are
essential
to
a
true
and
profitable
confession
of
sin
in
general
first
it
must
be
in
sorrowful
bitterness
of
spirit
a
condition
that
has
five
signs
shamefastness
humility
in
heart
and
outward
sign
weeping
with
the
bodily
eyes
or
in
the
heart
disregard
of
the
shame
that
might
curtail
or
garble
confession
and
obedience
to
the
penance
enjoined
secondly
true
confession
must
be
promptly
made
for
dread
of
death
of
increase
of
sinfulness
of
forgetfulness
of
what
should
be
confessed
of
christ
refusal
to
hear
if
it
be
put
off
to
the
last
day
of
life
and
this
condition
has
four
terms
that
confession
be
well
pondered
beforehand
that
the
man
confessing
have
comprehended
in
his
mind
the
number
and
greatness
of
his
sins
and
how
long
he
has
lain
in
sin
that
he
be
contrite
for
and
eschew
his
sins
and
that
he
fear
and
flee
the
occasions
for
that
sin
to
which
he
is
inclined
what
follows
under
this
head
is
of
some
interest
for
the
light
which
it
throws
on
the
rigorous
government
wielded
by
the
romish
church
in
those
days
also
thou
shalt
shrive
thee
of
all
thy
sins
to
one
man
and
not
a
parcel
portion
to
one
man
and
a
parcel
to
another
that
is
to
understand
in
intent
to
depart
divide
thy
confession
for
shame
or
dread
for
it
is
but
strangling
of
thy
soul
for
certes
jesus
christ
is
entirely
all
good
in
him
is
none
imperfection
and
therefore
either
he
forgiveth
all
perfectly
or
else
never
a
deal
not
at
all
i
say
not
that
if
thou
be
assigned
to
thy
penitencer
for
a
certain
sin
that
thou
art
bound
to
shew
him
all
the
remnant
of
thy
sins
of
which
thou
hast
been
shriven
of
thy
curate
but
if
it
like
thee
unless
thou
be
pleased
of
thy
humility
this
is
no
departing
division
of
shrift
and
i
say
not
where
i
speak
of
division
of
confession
that
if
thou
have
license
to
shrive
thee
to
a
discreet
and
an
honest
priest
and
where
thee
liketh
and
by
the
license
of
thy
curate
that
thou
mayest
not
well
shrive
thee
to
him
of
all
thy
sins
but
let
no
blot
be
behind
let
no
sin
be
untold
as
far
as
thou
hast
remembrance
and
when
thou
shalt
be
shriven
of
thy
curate
tell
him
eke
all
the
sins
that
thou
hast
done
since
thou
wert
last
shriven
this
is
no
wicked
intent
of
division
of
shrift
also
very
shrift
true
confession
asketh
certain
conditions
first
that
thou
shrive
thee
by
thy
free
will
not
constrained
nor
for
shame
of
folk
nor
for
malady
sickness
or
such
things
for
it
is
reason
that
he
that
trespasseth
by
his
free
will
that
by
his
free
will
he
confess
his
trespass
and
that
no
other
man
tell
his
sin
but
himself
nor
he
shall
not
nay
nor
deny
his
sin
nor
wrath
him
against
the
priest
for
admonishing
him
to
leave
his
sin
the
second
condition
is
that
thy
shrift
be
lawful
that
is
to
say
that
thou
that
shrivest
thee
and
eke
the
priest
that
heareth
thy
confession
be
verily
in
the
faith
of
holy
church
and
that
a
man
be
not
despaired
of
the
mercy
of
jesus
christ
as
cain
and
judas
were
and
eke
a
man
must
accuse
himself
of
his
own
trespass
and
not
another
but
he
shall
blame
and
wite
accuse
himself
of
his
own
malice
and
of
his
sin
and
none
other
but
nevertheless
if
that
another
man
be
occasion
or
else
enticer
of
his
sin
or
the
estate
of
the
person
be
such
by
which
his
sin
is
aggravated
or
else
that
be
may
not
plainly
shrive
him
but
unless
he
tell
the
person
with
which
he
hath
sinned
then
may
he
tell
so
that
his
intent
be
not
to
backbite
the
person
but
only
to
declare
his
confession
thou
shalt
not
eke
make
no
leasings
falsehoods
in
thy
confession
for
humility
peradventure
to
say
that
thou
hast
committed
and
done
such
sins
of
which
that
thou
wert
never
guilty
for
saint
augustine
saith
if
that
thou
because
of
humility
makest
a
leasing
on
thyself
though
thou
were
not
in
sin
before
yet
art
thou
then
in
sin
through
thy
leasing
thou
must
also
shew
thy
sin
by
thine
own
proper
mouth
but
unless
thou
be
dumb
and
not
by
letter
for
thou
that
hast
done
the
sin
thou
shalt
have
the
shame
of
the
confession
thou
shalt
not
paint
thy
confession
with
fair
and
subtle
words
to
cover
the
more
thy
sin
for
then
beguilest
thou
thyself
and
not
the
priest
thou
must
tell
it
plainly
be
it
never
so
foul
nor
so
horrible
thou
shalt
eke
shrive
thee
to
a
priest
that
is
discreet
to
counsel
thee
and
eke
thou
shalt
not
shrive
thee
for
nor
for
hypocrisy
nor
for
no
cause
but
only
for
the
doubt
fear
of
jesus
christ
and
the
health
of
thy
soul
thou
shalt
not
run
to
the
priest
all
suddenly
to
tell
him
lightly
thy
sin
as
who
telleth
a
jape
jest
or
a
tale
but
advisedly
and
with
good
devotion
and
generally
shrive
thee
oft
if
thou
oft
fall
oft
arise
by
confession
and
though
thou
shrive
thee
oftener
than
once
of
sin
of
which
thou
hast
been
shriven
it
is
more
merit
and
as
saith
saint
augustine
thou
shalt
have
the
more
lightly
easily
release
and
grace
of
god
both
of
sin
and
of
pain
and
certes
once
a
year
at
the
least
way
it
is
lawful
to
be
houseled
for
soothly
once
a
year
all
things
in
the
earth
renovelen
renew
themselves
here
ends
the
second
part
of
the
treatise
the
third
part
which
contains
the
practical
application
of
the
whole
follows
entire
along
with
the
remarkable
prayer
of
chaucer
as
it
stands
in
the
harleian
manuscript
de
tertia
parte
poenitentiae
of
the
third
part
of
penitence
now
have
i
told
you
of
very
true
confession
that
is
the
second
part
of
penitence
the
third
part
of
penitence
is
satisfaction
and
that
standeth
generally
in
almsdeed
and
bodily
pain
now
be
there
three
manner
of
almsdeed
contrition
of
heart
where
a
man
offereth
himself
to
god
the
second
is
to
have
pity
of
the
default
of
his
neighbour
the
third
is
in
giving
of
good
counsel
and
comfort
ghostly
and
bodily
where
men
have
need
and
namely
specially
sustenance
of
man
food
and
take
keep
heed
that
a
man
hath
need
of
these
things
generally
he
hath
need
of
food
of
clothing
and
of
herberow
lodging
he
hath
need
of
charitable
counsel
and
visiting
in
prison
and
malady
and
sepulture
of
his
dead
body
and
if
thou
mayest
not
visit
the
needful
with
thy
person
visit
them
by
thy
message
and
by
thy
gifts
these
be
generally
alms
or
works
of
charity
of
them
that
have
temporal
riches
or
discretion
in
counselling
of
these
works
shalt
thou
hear
at
the
day
of
doom
this
alms
shouldest
thou
do
of
thine
own
proper
things
and
hastily
promptly
and
privily
secretly
if
thou
mayest
but
nevertheless
if
thou
mayest
not
do
it
privily
thou
shalt
not
forbear
to
do
alms
though
men
see
it
so
that
it
be
not
done
for
thank
of
the
world
but
only
for
thank
of
jesus
christ
for
as
witnesseth
saint
matthew
chap
a
city
may
not
be
hid
that
is
set
on
a
mountain
nor
men
light
not
a
lantern
and
put
it
under
a
bushel
but
men
set
it
on
a
candlestick
to
light
the
men
in
the
house
right
so
shall
your
light
lighten
before
men
that
they
may
see
your
good
works
and
glorify
your
father
that
is
in
heaven
now
as
to
speak
of
bodily
pain
it
is
in
prayer
in
wakings
watchings
in
fastings
and
in
virtuous
teachings
of
orisons
ye
shall
understand
that
orisons
or
prayers
is
to
say
a
piteous
will
of
heart
that
redresseth
it
in
god
and
expresseth
it
by
word
outward
to
remove
harms
and
to
have
things
spiritual
and
durable
and
sometimes
temporal
things
of
which
orisons
certes
in
the
orison
of
the
pater
noster
hath
our
lord
jesus
christ
enclosed
most
things
certes
it
is
privileged
of
three
things
in
its
dignity
for
which
it
is
more
digne
worthy
than
any
other
prayer
for
jesus
christ
himself
made
it
and
it
is
short
for
in
order
it
should
be
coude
the
more
lightly
be
more
easily
conned
or
learned
and
to
withhold
retain
it
the
more
easy
in
heart
and
help
himself
the
oftener
with
this
orison
and
for
a
man
should
be
the
less
weary
to
say
it
and
for
a
man
may
not
excuse
him
to
learn
it
it
is
so
short
and
so
easy
and
for
it
comprehendeth
in
itself
all
good
prayers
the
exposition
of
this
holy
prayer
that
is
so
excellent
and
so
digne
i
betake
commit
to
these
masters
of
theology
save
thus
much
will
i
say
when
thou
prayest
that
god
should
forgive
thee
thy
guilts
as
thou
forgivest
them
that
they
guilt
to
thee
be
full
well
ware
that
thou
be
not
out
of
charity
this
holy
orison
aminisheth
lesseneth
eke
venial
sin
and
therefore
it
appertaineth
specially
to
penitence
this
prayer
must
be
truly
said
and
in
very
faith
and
that
men
pray
to
god
ordinately
discreetly
and
devoutly
and
always
a
man
shall
put
his
will
to
be
subject
to
the
will
of
god
this
orison
must
eke
be
said
with
great
humbleness
and
full
pure
and
honestly
and
not
to
the
annoyance
of
any
man
or
woman
it
must
eke
be
continued
with
the
works
of
charity
it
availeth
against
the
vices
of
the
soul
for
assaith
saint
jerome
by
fasting
be
saved
the
vices
of
the
flesh
and
by
prayer
the
vices
of
the
soul
after
this
thou
shalt
understand
that
bodily
pain
stands
in
waking
watching
for
jesus
christ
saith
wake
and
pray
that
ye
enter
not
into
temptation
ye
shall
understand
also
that
fasting
stands
in
three
things
in
forbearing
of
bodily
meat
and
drink
and
in
forbearing
of
worldly
jollity
and
in
forbearing
of
deadly
sin
this
is
to
say
that
a
man
shall
keep
him
from
deadly
sin
in
all
that
he
may
and
thou
shalt
understand
eke
that
god
ordained
fasting
and
to
fasting
appertain
four
things
largeness
generosity
to
poor
folk
gladness
of
heart
spiritual
not
to
be
angry
nor
annoyed
nor
grudge
murmur
for
he
fasteth
and
also
reasonable
hour
for
to
eat
by
measure
that
is
to
say
a
man
should
not
eat
in
untime
out
of
time
nor
sit
the
longer
at
his
meal
for
because
he
fasteth
then
shalt
thou
understand
that
bodily
pain
standeth
in
discipline
or
teaching
by
word
or
by
writing
or
by
ensample
also
in
wearing
of
hairs
haircloth
or
of
stamin
coarse
hempen
cloth
or
of
habergeons
on
their
naked
flesh
for
christ
sake
but
ware
thee
well
that
such
manner
penance
of
thy
flesh
make
not
thine
heart
bitter
or
angry
nor
annoyed
of
thyself
for
better
is
to
cast
away
thine
hair
than
to
cast
away
the
sweetness
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
therefore
saith
saint
paul
clothe
you
as
they
that
be
chosen
of
god
in
heart
of
misericorde
with
compassion
debonairte
gentleness
sufferance
patience
and
such
manner
of
clothing
of
which
jesus
christ
is
more
apaid
better
pleased
than
of
hairs
or
of
hauberks
then
is
discipline
eke
in
knocking
of
thy
breast
in
scourging
with
yards
rods
in
kneelings
in
tribulations
in
suffering
patiently
wrongs
that
be
done
to
him
and
eke
in
patient
sufferance
of
maladies
or
losing
of
worldly
catel
chattels
or
of
wife
or
of
child
or
of
other
friends
then
shalt
thou
understand
which
things
disturb
penance
and
this
is
in
four
things
that
is
dread
shame
hope
and
wanhope
that
is
desperation
and
for
to
speak
first
of
dread
for
which
he
weeneth
that
he
may
suffer
no
penance
thereagainst
is
remedy
for
to
think
that
bodily
penance
is
but
short
and
little
at
the
regard
of
in
comparison
with
the
pain
of
hell
that
is
so
cruel
and
so
long
that
it
lasteth
without
end
now
against
the
shame
that
a
man
hath
to
shrive
him
and
namely
specially
these
hypocrites
that
would
be
holden
so
perfect
that
they
have
no
need
to
shrive
them
against
that
shame
should
a
man
think
that
by
way
of
reason
he
that
hath
not
been
ashamed
to
do
foul
things
certes
he
ought
not
to
be
ashamed
to
do
fair
things
and
that
is
confession
a
man
should
eke
think
that
god
seeth
and
knoweth
all
thy
thoughts
and
all
thy
works
to
him
may
nothing
be
hid
nor
covered
men
should
eke
remember
them
of
the
shame
that
is
to
come
at
the
day
of
doom
to
them
that
be
not
penitent
and
shriven
in
this
present
life
for
all
the
creatures
in
heaven
and
in
earth
and
in
hell
shall
see
apertly
openly
all
that
he
hideth
in
this
world
now
for
to
speak
of
them
that
be
so
negligent
and
slow
to
shrive
them
that
stands
in
two
manners
the
one
is
that
he
hopeth
to
live
long
and
to
purchase
acquire
much
riches
for
his
delight
and
then
he
will
shrive
him
and
as
he
sayeth
he
may
as
him
seemeth
timely
enough
come
to
shrift
another
is
the
surquedrie
presumption
that
he
hath
in
mercy
against
the
first
vice
he
shall
think
that
our
life
is
in
no
sickerness
security
and
eke
that
all
the
riches
in
this
world
be
in
adventure
and
pass
as
a
shadow
on
the
wall
and
as
saith
st
gregory
that
it
appertaineth
to
the
great
righteousness
of
god
that
never
shall
the
pain
stint
cease
of
them
that
never
would
withdraw
them
from
sin
their
thanks
with
their
goodwill
but
aye
continue
in
sin
for
that
perpetual
will
to
do
sin
shall
they
have
perpetual
pain
wanhope
despair
is
in
two
manners
of
two
kinds
the
first
wanhope
is
in
the
mercy
of
god
the
other
is
that
they
think
they
might
not
long
persevere
in
goodness
the
first
wanhope
cometh
of
that
he
deemeth
that
he
sinned
so
highly
and
so
oft
and
so
long
hath
lain
in
sin
that
he
shall
not
be
saved
certes
against
that
cursed
wanhope
should
he
think
that
the
passion
of
jesus
christ
is
more
strong
for
to
unbind
than
sin
is
strong
for
to
bind
against
the
second
wanhope
he
shall
think
that
as
oft
as
he
falleth
he
may
arise
again
by
penitence
and
though
he
never
so
long
hath
lain
in
sin
the
mercy
of
christ
is
always
ready
to
receive
him
to
mercy
against
the
wanhope
that
he
thinketh
he
should
not
long
persevere
in
goodness
he
shall
think
that
the
feebleness
of
the
devil
may
nothing
do
but
unless
men
will
suffer
him
and
eke
he
shall
have
strength
of
the
help
of
god
and
of
all
holy
church
and
of
the
protection
of
angels
if
him
list
then
shall
men
understand
what
is
the
fruit
of
penance
and
after
the
word
of
jesus
christ
it
is
the
endless
bliss
of
heaven
where
joy
hath
no
contrariety
of
woe
nor
of
penance
nor
grievance
there
all
harms
be
passed
of
this
present
life
there
as
is
the
sickerness
security
from
the
pain
of
hell
there
as
is
the
blissful
company
that
rejoice
them
evermore
each
of
the
joy
there
as
the
body
of
man
that
whilom
was
foul
and
dark
is
more
clear
than
the
sun
there
as
the
body
of
man
that
whilom
was
sick
and
frail
feeble
and
mortal
is
immortal
and
so
strong
and
so
whole
that
there
may
nothing
apair
impair
injure
it
there
is
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
nor
cold
but
every
soul
replenished
with
the
sight
of
the
perfect
knowing
of
god
this
blissful
regne
kingdom
may
men
purchase
by
poverty
spiritual
and
the
glory
by
lowliness
the
plenty
of
joy
by
hunger
and
thirst
the
rest
by
travail
and
the
life
by
death
and
mortification
of
sin
to
which
life
he
us
bring
that
bought
us
with
his
precious
blood

notes
to
the
parson
tale
the
parson
tale
is
believed
to
be
a
translation
more
or
less
free
from
some
treatise
on
penitence
that
was
in
favour
about
chaucer
time
tyrwhitt
says
i
can
not
recommend
it
as
a
very
entertaining
or
edifying
performance
at
this
day
but
the
reader
will
please
to
remember
in
excuse
both
of
chaucer
and
of
his
editor
that
considering
the
canterbury
tales
as
a
great
picture
of
life
and
manners
the
piece
would
not
have
been
complete
if
it
had
not
included
the
religion
of
the
time
the
editor
of
the
present
volume
has
followed
the
same
plan
adopted
with
regard
to
chaucer
tale
of
meliboeus
and
mainly
for
the
same
reasons
see
note
to
that
tale
an
outline
of
the
ponderous
sermon
for
such
it
is
has
been
drawn
while
those
passages
have
been
given
in
full
which
more
directly
illustrate
the
social
and
the
religious
life
of
the
time
such
as
the
picture
of
hell
the
vehement
and
rather
coarse
but
in
an
antiquarian
sense
most
curious
and
valuable
attack
on
the
fashionable
garb
of
the
day
the
catalogue
of
venial
sins
the
description
of
gluttony
and
its
remedy
the
brief
third
or
concluding
part
which
contains
the
application
of
the
whole
and
the
retractation

prayer
that
closes
the
tale

the
entire
magnum
opus
of
chaucer

notes
to
the
prayer
of
chaucer
the
genuineness
and
real
significance
of
this
prayer
of
chaucer
usually
called
his
retractation
have
been
warmly
disputed
on
the
one
hand
it
has
been
declared
that
the
monks
forged
the
retractation
and
procured
its
insertion
among
the
works
of
the
man
who
had
done
so
much
to
expose
their
abuses
and
ignorance
and
to
weaken
their
hold
on
popular
credulity
on
the
other
hand
chaucer
himself
at
the
close
of
his
life
is
said
to
have
greatly
lamented
the
ribaldry
and
the
attacks
on
the
clergy
which
marked
especially
the
canterbury
tales
and
to
have
drawn
up
a
formal
retractation
of
which
the
prayer
is
either
a
copy
or
an
abridgment
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
prayer
as
tyrwhitt
points
out
are
in
tone
and
terms
quite
appropriate
in
the
mouth
of
the
parson
while
they
carry
on
the
subject
of
which
he
has
been
treating
and
despite
the
fact
that
mr
wright
holds
the
contrary
opinion
tyrwhitt
seems
to
be
justified
in
setting
down
the
retractation
as
interpolated
into
the
close
of
the
parson
tale
of
the
circumstances
under
which
the
interpolation
was
made
or
the
causes
by
which
it
was
dictated
little
or
nothing
can
now
be
confidently
affirmed
but
the
agreement
of
the
manuscripts
and
the
early
editions
in
giving
it
render
it
impossible
to
discard
it
peremptorily
as
a
declaration
of
prudish
or
of
interested
regret
with
which
chaucer
himself
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
you
who
with
the
father
and
the
holy
spirit
livest
and
reignest
god
for
ever
and
ever
amen
the
end
of
the
canterbury
tales
the
court
of
love
the
court
of
love
was
probably
chaucer
first
poem
of
any
consequence
it
is
believed
to
have
been
written
at
the
age
and
under
the
circumstances
of
which
it
contains
express
mention
that
is
when
the
poet
was
eighteen
years
old
and
resided
as
a
student
at
cambridge
about
the
year
the
composition
is
marked
by
an
elegance
care
and
finish
very
different
from
the
bold
freedom
which
in
so
great
measure
distinguishes
the
canterbury
tales
and
the
fact
is
easily
explained
when
we
remember
that
in
the
earlier
poem
chaucer
followed
a
beaten
path
in
which
he
had
many
predecessors
and
competitors
all
seeking
to
sound
the
praises
of
love
with
the
grace
the
ingenuity
and
studious
devotion
appropriate
to
the
theme
the
story
of
the
poem
is
exceedingly
simple
under
the
name
of
philogenet
a
clerk
or
scholar
of
cambridge
the
poet
relates
that
summoned
by
mercury
to
the
court
of
love
he
journeys
to
the
splendid
castle
where
the
king
and
queen
of
love
admetus
and
alcestis
keep
their
state
discovering
among
the
courtiers
a
friend
named
philobone
a
chamberwoman
to
the
queen
philogenet
is
led
by
her
into
a
circular
temple
where
in
a
tabernacle
sits
venus
with
cupid
by
her
side
while
he
is
surveying
the
motley
crowd
of
suitors
to
the
goddess
philogenet
is
summoned
back
into
the
king
presence
chidden
for
his
tardiness
in
coming
to
court
and
commanded
to
swear
observance
to
the
twenty
statutes
of
love
which
are
recited
at
length
philogenet
then
makes
his
prayers
and
vows
to
venus
desiring
that
he
may
have
for
his
love
a
lady
whom
he
has
seen
in
a
dream
and
philobone
introduces
him
to
the
lady
herself
named
rosial
to
whom
he
does
suit
and
service
of
love
at
first
the
lady
is
obdurate
to
his
entreaties
but
philogenet
having
proved
the
sincerity
of
his
passion
by
a
fainting
fit
rosial
relents
promises
her
favour
and
orders
philobone
to
conduct
him
round
the
court
the
courtiers
are
then
minutely
described
but
the
description
is
broken
off
abruptly
and
we
are
introduced
to
rosial
in
the
midst
of
a
confession
of
her
love
finally
she
commands
philogenet
to
abide
with
her
until
the
first
of
may
when
the
king
of
love
will
hold
high
festival
he
obeys
and
the
poem
closes
with
the
may
day
festival
service
celebrated
by
a
choir
of
birds
who
sing
an
ingenious
but
what
must
have
seemed
in
those
days
a
more
than
slightly
profane
paraphrase
or
parody
of
the
matins
for
trinity
sunday
to
the
praise
of
cupid
from
this
outline
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
chaucer
court
of
love
is
in
important
particulars
different
from
the
institutions
which
in
the
two
centuries
preceding
his
own
had
so
much
occupied
the
attention
of
poets
and
gallants
and
so
powerfully
controlled
the
social
life
of
the
noble
and
refined
classes
it
is
a
regal
not
a
legal
court
which
the
poet
pictures
to
us
we
are
not
introduced
to
a
regularly
constituted
and
authoritative
tribunal
in
which
nice
questions
of
conduct
in
the
relations
of
lovers
are
discussed
and
decided
but
to
the
central
and
sovereign
seat
of
love
authority
where
the
statutes
are
moulded
and
the
decrees
are
issued
upon
which
the
inferior
and
special
tribunals
we
have
mentioned
frame
their
proceedings
the
courts
of
love
in
chaucer
time
had
lost
none
of
the
prestige
and
influence
which
had
been
conferred
upon
them
by
the
patronage
and
participation
of
kings
queens
emperors
and
popes
but
the
institution
in
its
legal
or
judicial
character
was
peculiar
to
france
and
although
the
whole
spirit
of
chaucer
poem
especially
as
regards
the
esteem
and
reverence
in
which
women
were
held
is
that
which
animated
the
french
courts
his
treatment
of
the
subject
is
broader
and
more
general
consequently
more
fitted
to
enlist
the
interest
of
english
readers
transcriber
note
modern
scholars
believe
that
chaucer
was
not
the
author
of
this
poem
the
poem
consists
of
stanzas
of
seven
lines
each
of
which
in
this
edition
are
represented
by
a
prose
abridgement
with
timorous
heart
and
trembling
hand
of
dread
of
naked
bare
of
eloquence
unto
the

port
in
who
is
the
perfection
i
write
as

why

i
for

that

aright
no

so
is
she

of

there

so
for

and
say
that
she

of
her
worthiness
accept
this
little
short
treatess
that
is
entitled
thus
the
court
of

excuse
versifiers
i
you
beseech
for

sake
above
for
what
i
mean
in
this
ye
need
not
muse
and
if
so
be
my
lady
it
refuse
for
lack
of
ornate
speech
i
would
be
woe
that
i
presume
to
her
to
write
so
but
my
intent
and
all
my
busy
cure
is
for
to
write
this
treatise
as
i
can
unto
my
lady
stable
true
and
sure
faithful
and
kind
since
first
that
she
began
me
to
accept
in

her
be
all
the
pleasure
of
this
book
that
when
like
she
may
it
read
and
look

when
he
was
young
at
eighteen
year
of
age
lusty
and
light
desirous
of
pleasance
full
sad
and
ripe
corage
attaining
then
says
the
poet
did
love
urge
him
to
do
him
obeisance
and
to
go
the
court
of
love
to
see
a
lite
little
beside
the
mount
of
citharee
mercury
bade
him
on
pain
of
death
to
appear
and
he
went
by
strange
and
far
countries
in
search
of
the
court
seeing
at
last
a
crowd
of
people
as
bees
making
their
way
thither
the
poet
asked
whither
they
went
and
one
that
answer
like
a
maid
said
that
they
were
bound
to
the
court
of
love
at
citheron
where
the
king
of
love
and
all
his
noble
rout
company
dwelleth
within
a
castle
royally
so
them
apace
i
journey
forth
among
and
as
he
said
so
found
i
there
truly
for
i
beheld
the
town
so
high
and
strong
and
high
pinnacles
large
of
height
and
long
with
plate
of
gold
bespread
on
side
and
precious
stones
the
stone
work
for
to
hide
no
sapphire
of
ind
no
ruby
rich
of
price
there
lacked
then
nor
emerald
so
green
balais
turkeis
nor
thing
my
devise
my
that
may
the
castle
make
for
to
sheen
beautiful
all
was
as
bright
as
stars
in
winter
and
phoebus
shone
to
make
his
peace
again
for
done
to
high
estates
twain
when
he
had
found
venus
in
the
arms
of
mars
and
hastened
to
tell
vulcan
of
his
wife
infidelity
now
he
was
shining
brightly
on
the
castle
in
sign
he
looked
after
love
grace
for
there
is
no
god
in
heaven
or
in
hell
but
he
hath
been
right
subject
unto
love
continuing
his
description
of
the
castle
philogenet
says
that
he
saw
never
any
so
large
and
high
within
and
without
it
was
painted
with
many
a
thousand
daisies
red
as
rose
and
white
also
in
signification
of
whom
he
knew
not
unless
it
was
the
flower
of
alcestis
who
under
venus
was
queen
of
the
place
as
admetus
was
king
to
whom
obey
the
ladies
good
nineteen
with
many
a
thousand
other
bright
of
face
and
young
men
came
forth
with
lusty
pace
and
aged
eke
their
homage
to
dispose
but
what
they
were
i
could
not
well
disclose
yet
and
forth
in
i
gan
me
dress
into
a
hall
of
noble
apparail
with
arras
spread
and
cloth
of
gold
i
guess
and
other
silk
easier
avail
difficult
costly
to
under
the
of
their
estate
sans
fail
the
king
and
queen
there
sat
as
i
beheld
it
passed
joy
of
the
feld
elysian
there
have
their
coming
and
resort
for
love
to
see
the
king
so
royally
beseen
in
purple
clad
and
eke
the
queen
sort
and
on
their
heades
saw
i
crownes
twain
with
stones
frett
so
that
it
was
no
pain
withoute
meat
or
drink
to
stand
and
see
the
kinge
honour
and
the
royalty
to
treat
of
state
affairs
danger
stood
by
the
king
and
disdain
by
the
queen
who
cast
her
eyes
haughtily
about
sending
forth
beams
that
seemed
shapen
like
a
dart
sharp
and
piercing
and
small
and
straight
of
line
while
her
hair
shone
as
gold
so
fine
dishevel
crisp
down
hanging
at
her
back
a
yard
in
length
amazed
and
dazzled
by
her
beauty
philogenet
stood
perplexed
till
he
spied
a
maid
philobone
a
chamberwoman
of
the
queen
who
asked
how
and
on
what
errand
he
came
thither
learning
that
he
had
been
summoned
by
mercury
she
told
him
that
he
ought
to
have
come
of
his
free
will
and
that
he
will
be
shent
rebuked
disgraced
because
he
did
not
for
ye
that
reign
in
youth
and
lustiness
pamper
with
ease
and
jealous
in
your
age
your
duty
is
as
far
as
i
can
guess
to
love
court
to
your
voyage
address
as
soon
as
nature
maketh
you
so
sage
that
ye
may
know
a
woman
from
a
swan
or
when
your
foot
is
growen
half
a
span
but
since
that
ye
by
wilful
negligence
this
eighteen
year
have
kept
yourself
at
large
the
greater
is
your
trespass
and
offence
and
in
your
neck
you
must
bear
all
the
charge
for
better
were
ye
be
withoute
amid
the
sea
in
tempest
and
in
rain
than
bide
here
receiving
woe
and
pain
that
ordained
is
for
such
as
them
absent
from
love
court
by
yeares
long
and
fele
many
i
my
life
ye
shall
full
soon
repent
for
love
will
rive
your
colour
lust
and
heal
eke
ye
must
on
many
a
heavy
meal
force
i
stirr
you
long
agone
to
draw
to
court
quoth
little
philobone
ye
shall
well
see
how
rough
and
angry
face
the
king
of
love
will
show
when
ye
him
see
by
mine
advice
kneel
down
and
ask
him
grace
peril
and
adversity
for
well
i
wot
it
will
none
other
be
comfort
is
none
nor
counsel
to
your
ease
why
will
ye
then
the
king
of
love
displease
thereupon
philogenet
professed
humble
repentance
and
willingness
to
bear
all
hardship
and
chastisement
for
his
past
offence
these
wordes
said
she
caught
me
by
the
lap
of
the
garment
and
led
me
forth
into
a
temple
round
both
large
and
wide
and
as
my
blessed
hap
and
good
adventure
was
right
soon
i
found
a
tabernacle
raised
from
the
ground
where
venus
sat
and
cupid
by
her
side
yet
half
for
dread
i
gan
my
visage
hide
and
again
i
looked
and
beheld
seeing
sundry
in
the
place
of
many
and
folk
and
some
that
might
not
weld
their
limbes
well
me
thought
a
wonder
case
the
temple
shone
with
windows
all
of
glass
bright
as
the
day
with
many
a
fair
image
and
there
i
saw
the
fresh
queen
of
carthage
dido
that
her
beauty
for
the
love
of
false
aeneas
and
the
of
her
annelide
true
as
turtle
dove
to
arcite
false
and
there
was
in
painting
of
many
a
prince
and
many
a
doughty
king
whose
martyrdom
was
show
about
the
walls
and
how
that
for
love
had
suffer
falls
philogenet
was
astonished
at
the
crowd
of
people
that
he
saw
doing
sacrifice
to
the
god
and
goddess
philobone
informed
him
that
they
came
from
other
courts
those
who
knelt
in
blue
wore
the
colour
in
sign
of
their
changeless
truth
those
in
black
who
uttered
cries
of
grief
were
the
sick
and
dying
of
love
the
priests
nuns
hermits
and
friars
and
all
that
sat
in
white
in
russet
and
in
green
wailed
of
their
woe
and
for
all
people
of
every
degree
the
court
was
open
and
free
while
he
walked
about
with
philobone
a
messenger
from
the
king
entered
and
summoned
all
the
folk
to
the
royal
presence
trembling
and
pale
philogenet
approached
the
throne
of
admetus
and
was
sternly
asked
why
he
came
so
late
to
court
he
pleaded
that
a
hundred
times
he
had
been
at
the
gate
but
had
been
prevented
from
entering
by
failure
to
see
any
of
his
acquaintances
and
by
shamefacedness
the
king
pardoned
him
on
condition
that
thenceforth
he
should
serve
love
and
the
poet
took
oath
to
do
so
though
death
therefor
me
thirle
pierce
with
his
spear
when
the
king
had
seen
all
the
he
commanded
an
officer
to
take
their
oaths
of
allegiance
and
show
them
the
statutes
of
the
court
which
must
be
observed
till
death
and
for
that
i
was

read

dangerous
angry
if
that
a
thought
would
me
of
my
sleep
nor
of
a
sight
to
be
over
squaimous
and
so
verily
this
statute
was
to
keep
to
turn
and
wallow
in
my
bed
and
weep
when
that
my
lady
of
her
cruelty
would
from
her
heart
exilen
all
pity

hereupon
i
put

and
lowly
to
obey
and
show
my
cheer
yea
twenty
times
a
day
the
eighth

to
my
rememberance

was
the
sentence

that
i
and
all
should

be
too
overbold
her
to
displease
and
truly
so
i
shall

afear
the
tenth

between
the
lady
and
thine
ability
and
think
thyself
art
never
like
to
earn
by
right
her
mercy
nor
her
equity
but
of
her
grace
and
womanly
pity
for
though
thyself
be
noble
in
thy
strene
descent
a
thousand
fold
more
noble
is
thy
queen
thy
life
lady
and
thy
sovereign
that
hath
thine
heart
all
whole
in
governance
thou
no
wise
it
take
to
disdain
to
put
thee
humbly
at
her
ordinance
and
give
her
free
the
rein
of
her
pleasance
for
liberty
is
thing
that
women
look
for
desire
and
truly
else
matter
is
a
crook
go
th
eleventh
statute
thy
signes
for
to
know
with
eye
and
finger
and
with
smiles
soft
and
low
to
couch
and
alway
for
to
show
for
dread
of
spies
for
to
winken
oft
and
secretly
to
bring
a
sigh
aloft
but
still
beware
of
over
much
resort
for
that
peradventure
spoileth
all
thy
sport
the
twelfth
statute
remember
to
observe
for
all
the
pain
thou
hast
for
love
and
woe
all
is
too
her
mercy
to
deserve
thou
muste
think
thou
ride
or
go
and
mortal
woundes
suffer
thou
also
all
for
her
sake
and
think
it
well
upon
thy
love
for
it
may
not
be
bet
spent
the
thirteenth
statute
whilom
is
to
think
what
thing
may
best
thy
lady
like
and
please
and
in
thine
hearte
bottom
let
it
sink
some
thing
devise
and
take
for
it
thine
ease
and
send
it
her
that
may
her
heart
appease
some
heart
or
ring
or
letter
or
device
or
precious
stone
but
spare
not
for
no
price
the
fourteenth
statute
eke
thou
shalt
assay
firmly
to
keep
the
most
part
of
thy
life
wish
that
thy
lady
in
thine
armes
lay
and
nightly
dream
thou
hast
thy
nighte
wife
sweetly
in
armes
straining
her
as
blife
and
when
thou
seest
it
is
but
fantasy
see
that
thou
sing
not
over
merrily
for
too
much
joy
hath
oft
a
woeful
end
it
eke
this
statute
for
to
hold
belongs
to
the
proper
to
deem
thy
lady
evermore
thy
friend
observance
of
this
and
think
thyself
in
no
wise
a
cuckold
in
thing
she
doth
but
as
she
construe
the
best
believe
no
tales
new
for
many
a
lie
is
told
that
seems
full
true
but
think
that
she
so
bounteous
and
fair
could
not
be
false
imagine
this
algate
all
events
and
think
that
wicked
tongues
would
her
apair
her
name
and
estate
and
lovers
true
to
setten
at
debate
and
though
thou
seest
a
fault
right
at
thine
eye
excuse
it
blife
and
it
prettily
it
over
the
fifteenth
statute
use
to
swear
and
stare
and
counterfeit
a
hardily
to
save
thy
lady
honour
and
put
thyself
for
her
to
fight
boldly
say
she
is

there
was
not

called
rigour
who
is
incorruptible
by
partiality
favour
prayer

made
them
swear
to
keep
the
statutes
and
after
taking
the
oath
philogenet
turned
over

of
the
book
containing
the
statutes
of

rigour
sternly
bade

save
only
this
by
god
and
by
my
troth
troubled
i
was
with
slumber
sleep
and
sloth
this
other
night
and
in
a
vision
i
saw
a
woman
roamen
up
and
down
of
stature
and
seemly
to
behold
lusty
and
fresh
demure
of
countenance
young
and
well
shap
with
haire
as
gold
with
eyne
as
crystal
with
pleasance
and
she
gan
stir
mine
heart
a
to
dance
but
suddenly
she
vanish
gan
right
there
thus
i
may
say
i
love
and
not
where
if
he
could
only
know
this
lady
he
would
serve
and
obey
her
with
all
benignity
but
if
his
destiny
were
otherwise
he
would
gladly
love
and
serve
his
lady
whosoever
she
might
be
he
called
on
venus
for
help
to
possess
his
queen
and
heart
life
and
vowed
daily
war
with
diana
that
goddess
chaste
i
keepen
care
in
no
wise
to
serve
a
fig
for
all
her
chastity
then
he
rose
and
went
his
way
passing
by
a
rich
and
beautiful
shrine
which
philobone
informed
him
was
the
sepulchre
of
pity
a
tender
creature
she
said
is
shrined
there
and
pity
is
her
name
she
saw
an
eagle
him
on
a
fly
and
pluck
his
wing
and
eke
him
his
game
and
tender
heart
of
that
hath
made
her
die
eke
she
would
weep
and
mourn
right
piteously
to
see
a
lover
suffer
great
distress
in
all
the
court
was
none
as
i
do
guess
that
could
a
lover
half
so
well
avail
nor
of
his
woe
the
torment
or
the
rage
aslake
for
he
was
sure
withoute
fail
that
of
his
grief
she
could
the
heat
assuage
instead
of
pity
speedeth
hot
courage
the
matters
all
of
court
now
she
is
dead
me
report
in
this
to
womanhead
evidence
i
refer
to
the
behaviour
of
women
themselves
for
wail
and
weep
and
cry
and
speak
and
pray
women
would
not
have
pity
on
thy
plaint
nor
by
that
means
to
ease
thine
heart
convey
but
thee
receive
for
their
own
talent
and
say
that
pity
caus
thee
in
consent
of
ruth
to
take
thy
service
and
thy
pain
in
that
thou
to
please
thy
sovereign
philobone
now
promised
to
lead
philogenet
to
the
fairest
lady
under
sun
that
is
the
mirror
of
joy
and
bliss
whose
name
is
rosial
and
whose
heart
as
yet
is
given
to
no
wight
suggesting
that
as
he
also
was
with
love
but
light
advanc
he
might
set
this
lady
in
the
place
of
her
of
whom
he
had
dreamed
entering
a
chamber
gay
there
was
rosial
womanly
to
see
and
the
beams
of
her
eyes
wounded
philogenet
to
the
heart
when
he
could
speak
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
beseeching
her
to
cool
his
fervent
woe
for
there
i
took
full
purpose
in
my
mind
unto
her
grace
my
painful
heart
to
bind
for
if
i
shall
all
fully
her
descrive
her
head
was
round
by
compass
of
nature
her
hair
as
gold
she
passed
all
alive
and
lily
forehead
had
this
creature
with
lively
flaw
of
colour
pure
eyebrows
between
the
which
was
mean
disseverance
from
brow
to
show
a
due
distance
her
nose
directed
straight
even
as
line
with
form
and
shape
thereto
convenient
in
which
the
doth
shine
and
eke
her
eyne
be
bright
and
orient
as
is
the
smaragd
unto
my
judgment
or
yet
these
starres
small
and
bright
her
visage
is
of
lovely
red
and
white
her
mouth
is
short
and
shut
in
little
space
flaming
somedeal
not
over
red
i
mean
with
pregnant
lips
and
thick
to
kiss
it
chanced
for
lippes
thin
not
fat
but
ever
lean
they
serve
of
naught
they
be
not
worth
a
bean
for
if
the
be
full
there
is
delight
maximian
truly
thus
doth
he
write
but
to
my
purpose
i
say
white
as
snow
be
all
her
teeth
and
in
order
they
stand
of
one
stature
and
eke
her
breath
i
trow
surmounteth
all
odours
that
i
in
sweetness
and
her
body
face
and
hand
be
sharply
slender
so
that
from
the
head
unto
the
foot
all
is
but
womanhead
perfection
i
hold
my
peace
of
other
thinges
hid
here
shall
my
soul
and
not
my
tongue
bewray
but
how
she
was
array
if
ye
me
bid
that
shall
i
well
discover
you
and
say
a
of
gold
and
silk
full
fresh
and
gay
with
hair
tress
full
well
in
right
smoothly
kempt
and
shining
every
deal
about
her
neck
a
of
fresh
device
with
rubies
set
that
lusty
were
to
and
she
in
gown
was
light
and
shapen
full
well
the
colour
was
of
green
with
about
her
sides
clean
with
divers
stones
precious
and
rich
thus
was
she
ray
yet
saw
i
her
lich
if
jove
had
but
seen
this
lady
calisto
and
alcmena
had
never
lain
in
his
arms
nor
had
he
loved
the
fair
europa
nor
danae
nor
antiope
for
all
their
beauty
stood
in
rosial
she
seemed
like
a
thing
celestial
by
and
by
philogenet
presented
to
her
his
petition
for
love
which
she
heard
with
some
haughtiness
she
was
not
she
said
well
acquainted
with
him
she
did
not
know
where
he
dwelt
nor
his
name
and
condition
he
informed
her
that
in
art
of
love
he
writes
and
makes
songs
that
may
be
sung
in
honour
of
the
king
and
queen
of
love
as
for
his
name
my
name
alas
my
heart
why
thou
strange
so
cold
philogenet
i
call
am
far
and
near
or
distant
of
cambridge
clerk
that
never
think
to
change
from
you
that
with
your
clear
glances
ravish
my
heart
and
ghost
and
all
in
fere
together
since
at
the
first
i
writ
my
for
grace
me
thinks
i
see
some
mercy
in
your
face
and
again
he
humbly
pressed
his
suit
but
the
lady
disdained
the
idea
that
for
a
word
of
sugar
eloquence
she
should
have
compassion
in
so
little
space
there
come
but
few
who
speede
here
so
soon
if
as
he
says
the
beams
of
her
eyes
pierce
and
fret
him
then
let
him
withdraw
from
her
presence
hurt
not
yourself
through
folly
with
a
look
i
would
be
sorry
so
to
make
you
sick
a
woman
should
beware
eke
whom
she
took
ye
be
a
clerk
go
searche
well
my
book
if
any
women
be
so
to
win
nay
bide
a
while
though
ye
were
my
kin
only
he
might
sue
and
serve
and
wax
pale
and
green
and
dead
without
murmuring
in
any
wise
but
whereas
he
desired
her
hastily
to
lean
to
love
he
was
unwise
and
must
cease
that
language
for
some
had
been
at
court
for
twenty
years
and
might
not
obtain
their
mistresses
favour
therefore
she
marvelled
that
he
was
so
bold
as
to
treat
of
love
with
her
philogenet
on
this
broke
into
pitiful
lamentation
bewailing
the
hour
in
which
he
was
born
and
assuring
the
unyielding
lady
that
the
frosty
grave
and
cold
must
be
his
bed
unless
she
relented
with
that
i
fell
in
swoon
and
dead
as
stone
with
colour
slain
and
wan
as
ashes
pale
and
by
the
hand
she
caught
me
up
anon
arise
quoth
she
what
have
ye
drunken
dwale
potion
why
sleepe
ye
it
is
no
nightertale
now
mercy
sweet
quoth
i
afraid
what
thing
quoth
she
hath
made
you
so
dismay
she
said
that
by
his
hue
she
knew
well
that
he
was
a
lover
and
if
he
were
secret
courteous
and
kind
he
might
know
how
all
this
could
be
allayed
she
would
amend
all
that
she
had
missaid
and
set
his
heart
at
ease
but
he
must
faithfully
keep
the
statutes
and
break
them
not
for
sloth
nor
ignorance
the
lover
requests
however
that
the
sixteenth
may
be
released
or
modified
for
it
doth
him
great
grievance
and
she
complies
and
softly
then
her
colour
gan
appear
as
rose
so
red
throughout
her
visage
all
wherefore
methinks
it
is
her
to
that
she
of
right
be
called
rosial
thus
have
i
won
with
wordes
great
and
small
some
goodly
word
of
her
that
i
love
best
and
trust
she
shall
yet
set
mine
heart
in
rest
rosial
now
told
philobone
to
conduct
philogenet
all
over
the
court
and
show
him
what
lovers
and
what
officers
dwelt
there
for
he
was
yet
a
stranger
and
stalking
soft
with
easy
pace
i
saw
about
the
king
standen
all
environ
attendance
diligence
and
their
fellaw
furtherer
esperance
and
many
one
there
stood
and
not
alone
for
there
was
eke
the
cruel
adversair
the
lover
foe
that
called
is
despair
which
unto
me
spake
angrily
and
fell
and
said
my
lady
me

thou
quoth
she
that
all
that
she
did
tell
is
true

off
thine
heart
for
all
her
wordes
white
for
in
good
faith
she
loves
thee
but
a
lite
and
eke
remember
thine
ability
may
not
compare
with
her
this
well
thou
wot
yea
then
came
hope
and
said
my
friend
let
be
believe
him
not
despair
he
gins
to
doat
alas
quoth
i
here
is
both
cold
and
hot
the
one
me
biddeth
love
the
other
nay
thus
wot
i
not
what
me
is
best
to
say
but
well
wot
i
my
lady
granted
me
truly
to
be
my
wounde
remedy
her
may
not
infected
be
nature
with
doubleness
this
trust
i
till
i
die
so
cast
i
t
avoid
despair
company
and
take
hope
to
counsel
and
to
friend
yea
keep
that
well
quoth
philobone
in
mind
and
there
beside
within
a
bay
window
stood
one
in
green
full
large
of
breadth
and
length
his
beard
as
black
as
feathers
of
the
crow
his
name
was
lust
of
wondrous
might
and
strength
and
with
delight
to
argue
there
he
for
this
was
alway
his
opinion
that
love
was
sin
and
so
he
hath
begun
to
reason
fast
and
authority
authorities
nay
quoth
delight
love
is
a
virtue
clear
and
from
the
soul
his
progress
holdeth
he
blind
appetite
of
lust
doth
often
steer
the
heart
and
that
is
sin
for
reason
lacketh
there
for
thou
dost
think
thy
neighbour
wife
to
win
yet
think
it
well
that
love
may
not
be
sin
for
god
and
saint
they
love
right
verily
void
of
all
sin
and
vice
this
know
i
weel
affection
of
flesh
is
sin
truly
but
love
is
virtue
as
i
feel
for
very
love
may
frail
desire
akele
for
very
love
is
love
withoute
sin
now
stint
quoth
lust
thou
not
worth
a
pin
and
there
i
left
them
in
their
arguing
roaming
farther
into
the
castle
wide
and
in
a
corner
liar
stood
talking
of
fast
with
flattery
there
beside
he
said
that
women
attire
of
pride
and
men
were
found
of
nature
variant
and
could
be
false
and
beau
semblant
on
plausible
appearances
to
then
flattery
bespake
and
said
see
so
she
goes
on
pattens
fair
and
feat
neat
it
doth
right
well
what
pretty
man
is
this
that
roameth
here
now
truly
drink
nor
meat
need
i
not
have
my
heart
for
joy
doth
beat
him
to
behold
so
is
he
goodly
fresh
it
seems
for
love
his
heart
is
tender
and
nesh
this
is
the
court
of
lusty
folk
and
glad
and
well
becomes
their
habit
and
array
o
why
be
some
so
sorry
and
so
sad
complaining
thus
in
black
and
white
and
gray
friars
they
be
and
monkes
in
good
fay
alas
for
ruth
great
it
is
to
see
to
see
them
thus
bewail
and
sorry
be
see
how
they
cry
and
ring
their
handes
white
for
they
so
went
to
religion
and
eke
the
nuns
with
veil
and
wimple
plight
their
thought
is
they
be
in
confusion
alas
they
say
we
feign
perfection
in
clothes
wide
and
lack
our
liberty
but
all
the
sin
must
on
our
friendes
be
for
venus
wot
we
would
as
as
ye
that
be
attired
here
and
beseen
desire
man
and
love
in
our
degree
firm
and
faithful
right
as
would
the
queen
our
friendes
wick
in
tender
youth
and
green
against
our
will
made
us
religious
that
is
the
cause
we
mourn
and
waile
thus
then
said
the
monks
and
friars
the
tide
the
same
well
may
we
curse
our
abbeys
and
our
place
our
statutes
sharp
to
sing
in
copes
wide
chastely
to
keep
us
out
of
love
grace
and
never
to
feel
comfort
nor
solace
yet
suffer
we
the
heat
of
love
fire
and
after
some
other
haply
we
desire
o
fortune
cursed
why
now
and
wherefore
hast
thou
they
said
bereft
us
liberty
since
nature
gave
us
instrument
in
store
and
appetite
to
love
and
lovers
be
why
must
we
suffer
such
adversity
dian
to
serve
and
venus
to
refuse
full
these
matters
do
us
muse
a
we
serve
and
honour
sore
against
our
will
of
chastity
the
goddess
and
the
queen
liefer
with
venus
bide
still
would
and
have
regard
for
love
and
subject
unto
these
women
courtly
fresh
and
sheen
beautiful
fortune
we
curse
thy
wheel
of
variance
where
we
were
well
thou
our
pleasance
away
thus
leave
i
them
with
voice
of
plaint
and
care
in
raging
woe
crying
full
piteously
and
as
i
went
full
naked
and
full
bare
some
i
beheld
looking
dispiteously
on
poverty
that
deadly
cast
their
eye
and
they
cried
and
were
not
fain
for
they
might
not
their
glad
desire
attain
for
lack
of
riches
worldly
and
of
good
they
ban
and
curse
and
weep
and
say
alas
that
povert
hath
us
hent
that
whilom
stood
at
hearte
ease
and
free
and
in
good
case
but
now
we
dare
not
show
ourselves
in
place
nor
us
to
dwell
in
company
bold
venture
where
as
our
heart
would
love
right
faithfully
and
yet
againward
shrieked
nun
the
pang
of
love
so
strained
them
to
cry
now
woe
the
time
quoth
they
that
we
be
boun
this
hateful
order
will
do
us
die
which
we
foolishly
we
sigh
and
sob
and
bleeden
inwardly
entered
fretting
ourselves
with
thought
and
hard
complaint
that
nigh
for
love
we
waxe
and
faint
and
as
i
stood
beholding
here
and
there
i
was
ware
of
a
full
languishing
class
of
people
savage
and
wild
of
looking
and
of
cheer
their
mantles
and
their
clothes
aye
tearing
and
oft
they
were
of
nature
complaining
for
they
their
members
lacked
foot
and
hand
with
visage
wry
and
blind
i
understand
they
lacked
shape
and
beauty
to
prefer
themselves
in
love
and
said
that
god
and
had
them
to
worshippe
the
sterre
venus
the
bright
and
leften
all
behind
his
other
workes
clean
and
out
of
mind
for
other
have
their
full
shape
and
beauty
and
we
quoth
they
be
in
deformity
and
nigh
to
them
there
was
a
company
that
have
the
sisters
warray
and
missaid
i
mean
the
three
of
fatal
destiny
that
be
our
workers
suddenly
abraid
out
gan
they
cry
as
they
had
been
afraid
we
curse
quoth
they
that
ever
hath
nature
us
this
woeful
life
and
there
eke
was
contrite
and
gan
repent
confessing
whole
the
wound
that
cythere
had
with
the
dart
of
hot
desire
him
sent
and
how
that
he
to
love
must
subject
be
then
held
he
all
his
scornes
vanity
and
said
that
lovers
held
a
blissful
life
young
men
and
old
and
widow
maid
and
wife
bereave
me
goddess
quoth
he
of
thy
might
my
scornes
all
and
scoffes
that
i
have
no
power
for
to
mocken
any
wight
that
in
thy
service
dwell
for
i
did
rave
this
know
i
well
right
now
so
god
me
save
and
i
shall
be
the
chief
of
thy
faith
pillar
and
love
uphold
the
reverse
whoso
saith
dissemble
stood
not
far
from
him
in
truth
with
mantle
party
hood
and
hose
and
said
he
had
upon
his
lady
ruth
and
thus
he
wound
him
in
and
gan
to
glose
of
his
intent
full
double
i
suppose
in
all
the
world
he
said
he
lov
her
weel
but
ay
me
thought
he
lov
her
a
deal
a
eke
shamefastness
was
there
as
i
took
heed
that
blushed
red
and
durst
not
be
she
lover
was
for
thereof
had
she
dread
she
stood
and
hung
her
visage
down
alow
but
such
a
sight
it
was
to
see
i
trow
as
of
these
roses
ruddy
on
their
stalk
there
could
no
wight
her
spy
to
speak
or
talk
in
love
art
so
gan
she
to
abash
nor
durst
not
utter
all
her
privity
many
a
stripe
and
many
a
grievous
lash
she
gave
to
them
that
woulde
lovers
be
and
hinder
sore
the
simple
commonalty
that
in
no
wise
durst
grace
and
mercy
crave
for
not
she
they
need
but
ask
and
have
for
where
if
they
now
approache
for
to
speak
then
shamefastness
again
them
they
think
if
we
our
secret
counsel
break
our
ladies
will
have
scorn
us
certain
and
peradventure
thinke
great
disdain
thus
shamefastness
may
bringen
in
despair
when
she
is
dead
the
other
will
be
heir
come
forth
avaunter
now
i
ring
thy
bell
i
spied
him
soon
to
god
i
make
avow
he
looked
black
as
fiendes
do
in
hell
the
first
quoth
he
that
ever
i
did
wow
a
word
she
came
i
wot
not
how
was
won
with
so
that
in
armes
was
my
lady
free
a
single
and
so
have
been
a
thousand
more
than
she
in
england
britain
spain
and
picardy
artois
and
france
and
up
in
high
holland
in
burgoyne
naples
and
in
italy
navarre
and
greece
and
up
in
heathen
land
was
never
woman
yet
that
would
withstand
to
be
at
my
commandment
when
i
i
lacked
neither
silver
coin
nor
gold
and
there
i
met
with
this
estate
and
that
and
her
i
broach
and
her
and
her
i
trow
lo
there
goes
one
of
mine
and
wot
ye
what
yon
fresh
attired
have
i
laid
full
low
and
such
one
yonder
eke
right
well
i
know
i
kept
the
statute
when
we
lay
and
yon
same
hath
made
me
right
good
cheer
thus
hath
avaunter
blowen
all
that
he
knows
and
more
a
thousand
fold
his
ancestry
of
kin
was
to
lier
for
first
he
maketh
promise
for
to
hold
his
lady
counsel
and
it
not
unfold
wherefore
the
secret
when
he
doth
unshit
then
lieth
he
that
all
the
world
may
wit
for
falsing
so
his
promise
and
behest
i
wonder
sore
he
hath
such
fantasy
he
lacketh
wit
i
trow
or
is
a
beast
that
can
no
himself
with
reason
by
mine
advice
love
shall
be
contrary
to
his
avail
and
him
eke
dishonour
so
that
in
court
he
shall
no
more
sojour
remain
take
heed
quoth
she
this
little
philobone
where
envy
rocketh
in
the
corner
yond
and
sitteth
dark
and
ye
shall
see
anon
his
lean
body
fading
both
face
and
hand
himself
he
fretteth
as
i
understand
devoureth
witness
of
ovid
metamorphoseos
the
lover
foe
he
is
i
will
not
glose
over
for
where
a
lover
thinketh
promote
promote
envy
will
grudge
repining
at
his
weal
it
swelleth
sore
about
his
hearte
root
that
in
no
wise
he
can
not
live
in
heal
and
if
the
faithful
to
his
lady
steal
envy
will
noise
and
ring
it
round
about
and
say
much
worse
than
done
is
out
of
doubt
and
privy
thought
rejoicing
of
himself
stood
not
far
thence
in
habit
marvellous
yon
is
thought
i
some
spirit
or
some
elf
his
subtile
image
is
so
curious
how
is
quoth
i
that
he
is
shaded
thus
with
yonder
cloth
i
of
what
color
not
and
near
i
went
and
gan
lear
and
pore
ascertain
and
gaze
and
him
a
question
full
hard
what
is
quoth
i
the
thing
thou
lovest
best
or
what
is
unto
thy
paines
hard
me
thinks
thou
livest
here
in
great
unrest
thou
aye
from
south
to
east
and
west
and
east
to
north
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
no
place
in
court
may
holde
thee
whom
followest
thou
where
is
thy
heart
but
demand
assoil
i
thee
require
my
me
thought
quoth
he
no
creature
may
me
to
be
here
and
where
as
i
desire
for
where
as
absence
hath
out
the
fire
my
merry
thought
it
kindleth
yet
again
that
bodily
me
thinks
with
i
stand
and
speak
and
laugh
and
kiss
and
halse
so
that
my
thought
comforteth
me
full
oft
i
think
god
wot
though
all
the
world
be
false
i
will
be
true
i
think
also
how
soft
my
lady
is
in
speech
and
this
on
loft
bringeth
my
heart
with
joy
and
great
gladness
this
privy
thought
allays
my
heaviness
and
what
i
think
or
where
to
be
no
man
in
all
this
earth
can
tell
but
i
and
eke
there
is
no
swallow
swift
nor
swan
so
of
wing
nor
half
so
can
fly
for
i
can
be
and
that
right
suddenly
in
in
hell
in
paradise
and
here
and
with
my
lady
when
i
will
desire
i
am
of
counsel
far
and
wide
i
wot
with
lord
and
lady
and
their
privity
i
wot
it
all
but
be
it
cold
or
hot
they
shall
not
speak
without
licence
of
me
i
mean
in
such
as
be
first
the
thing
is
thought
within
the
heart
ere
any
word
out
from
the
mouth
astart
and
with
the
word
thought
bade
farewell
and
yede
away
eke
forth
went
i
to
see
the
courte
guise
and
at
the
door
came
in
so
god
me
speed
two
courtiers
of
age
and
of
like
high
and
broad
and
as
i
me
advise
the
golden
love
and
leaden
love
they
hight
called
the
one
was
sad
the
other
glad
and
light
at
this
point
there
is
a
hiatus
in
the
poem
which
abruptly
ceases
to
narrate
the
tour
of
philogenet
and
philobone
round
the
court
and
introduces
us
again
to
rosial
who
is
speaking
thus
to
her
lover
apparently
in
continuation
of
a
confession
of
love
yes
draw
your
heart
with
all
your
force
and
might
to
lustiness
and
be
as
ye
have
said
she
admits
that
she
would
have
given
him
no
drop
of
favour
but
that
she
saw
him
wax
so
dead
of
countenance
then
pity
out
of
her
shrine
arose
from
death
to
life
whisperingly
entreating
that
she
would
do
him
some
pleasance
philogenet
protests
his
gratitude
to
pity
his
faithfulness
to
rosial
and
the
lady
thanking
him
heartily
bids
him
abide
with
her
till
the
season
of
may
when
the
king
of
love
and
all
his
company
will
hold
his
feast
fully
royally
and
well
and
there
i
bode
till
that
the
season
fell
on
may
day
when
the
lark
began
to
rise
to
matins
went
the
lusty
nightingale
within
a
temple
shapen
he
might
not
sleep
in
all
the
nightertale
but
domine

he
cry
and

our
health
and
to
the
desk
anon
they
gan
to
fall
and
who
came
late
he
pressed
in
by
stealth
then
said
the
falcon

the
god
that

thus
hot

then
came

fresh
and
gay
and
said
this
psalm
with
heartly
glad
intent
domini
est
terra
this
latin
intent
the
god
of
love

and
then
the

began
to

of

by

on

and
engaged
in
the
discussion
of
a
controversy
regarding
love
is
not
occupied
with
the
particular
cause
which
in
the
present
poem
the
nightingale
appeals
to
the
parliament
but
the
cuckoo
and
the
nightingale
none
the
less
serves
as
a
link
between
the
two
poems
indicating
as
it
does
the
nature
of
those
controversies
in
matters
subject
to
the
supreme
control
of
the
king
and
queen
of
love
which
in
the
subsequent
poem
we
find
the
courtiers
under
the
guise
of
birds
debating
in
full
conclave
and
under
legal
forms
exceedingly
simple
in
conception
and
written
in
a
metre
full
of
musical
irregularity
and
forcible
freedom
the
cuckoo
and
the
nightingale
yields
in
vividness
delicacy
and
grace
to
none
of
chaucer
minor
poems
we
are
told
that
the
poet
on
the
third
night
of
may
is
sleepless
and
rises
early
in
the
morning
to
try
if
he
may
hear
the
nightingale
sing
wandering
by
a
he
sits
down
on
the
flowery
lawn
and
ere
long
lulled
by
the
sweet
melody
of
many
birds
and
the
music
of
the
stream
he
falls
into
a
kind
of
doze
not
all
asleep
nor
fully
waking
then
an
evil
omen
he
hears
the
cuckoo
sing
before
the
nightingale
but
soon
he
hears
the
nightingale
request
the
cuckoo
to
remove
far
away
and
leave
the
place
to
birds
that
can
sing
the
cuckoo
enters
into
a
defence
of
her
song
which
becomes
a
railing
accusation
against
love
and
a
recital
of
the
miseries
which
love
servants
endure
the
nightingale
vindicates
love
in
a
lofty
and
tender
strain
but
is
at
last
overcome
with
sorrow
by
the
bitter
words
of
the
cuckoo
and
calls
on
the
god
of
love
for
help
on
this
the
poet
starts
up
and
snatching
a
stone
from
the
brook
throws
it
at
the
cuckoo
who
flies
away
full
fast
the
grateful
nightingale
promises
that
for
this
service
she
will
be
her
champion
singer
all
that
may
she
warns
him
against
believing
the
cuckoo
the
foe
of
love
and
then
having
sung
him
one
of
her
new
songs
she
flies
away
to
all
the
other
birds
that
are
in
that
dale
assembles
them
and
demands
that
they
should
do
her
right
upon
the
cuckoo
by
one
assent
it
is
agreed
that
a
parliament
shall
be
held
the
morrow
after
saint
valentine
day
under
a
maple
before
the
window
of
queen
philippa
at
woodstock
when
judgment
shall
be
passed
upon
the
cuckoo
then
the
nightingale
flies
into
a
hawthorn
and
sings
a
lay
of
love
so
loud
that
the
poet
awakes
the
stanza
of
which
the
first
second
and
fifth
lines
agree
in
one
rhyme
the
third
and
fourth
in

to
this

the
prevailing
measure
is
the
decasyllabic
line
used
in

of
the
lines

syllables

scholars

old
and
unlusty
yet
i
have
felt
the
sickness
thorough
may
hot
and
cold
an
access
day
day
a
hot
and
a
how
sore
there
wot
no
wight
but
cold
i
am
so
shaken
with
the
fevers
white
of
all
this
may
sleep
i
but
lite
and
also
it
is
not
unto
me
that
any
hearte
shoulde
sleepy
be
in
whom
that
love
his
fiery
dart
will
smite
but
as
i
lay
this
other
night
waking
i
thought
how
lovers
had
a
tokening
and
among
them
it
was
a
common
tale
that
it
were
good
to
hear
the
nightingale
rather
than
the
lewd
cuckoo
sing
and
then
i
thought
it
was
day
i
would
go
somewhere
to
assay
if
that
i
might
a
nightingale
hear
for
yet
had
i
none
heard
of
all
that
year
and
it
was
then
the
thirde
night
of
may
and
anon
as
i
the
day
espied
no
longer
would
i
in
my
bed
abide
but
to
a
wood
that
was
fast
by
i
went
forth
alone
boldely
and
held
the
way
down
by
a
brooke
side
till
i
came
to
a
of
white
and
green
so
fair
a
one
had
i
never
in
been
the
ground
was
green
with
daisy
with
the
flowers
and
the
like
high
of
the
same
all
green
and
white
was
nothing
elles
seen
there
sat
i
down
among
the
faire
and
saw
the
birdes
trip
out
of
their
there
as
they
rested
them
alle
the
night
they
were
so
joyful
of
the
daye
light
they
began
of
may
for
to
do
honours
they
that
service
all
by
rote
there
was
many
a
lovely
note
some
sange
loud
as
they
had
plain
and
some
in
other
manner
voice
feign
and
some
all
out
with
the
full
throat
they
them
and
made
them
right
gay
their
feathers
and
danc
and
leapt
upon
the
spray
and
evermore
two
and
two
in
fere
right
so
as
they
had
chosen
them
year
in
upon
saint
valentine
day
and
the
river
that
i
sat
upon
it
made
such
a
noise
as
it
ran
with
the
birde
harmony
time
with
me
thought
it
was
the
beste
melody
that
might
be
heard
of
any
man
and
for
delight
i
wote
never
how
i
fell
in
such
a
slumber
and
a
swow
not
all
asleep
nor
fully
waking
and
in
that
swow
me
thought
i
hearde
sing
the
sorry
bird
the
lewd
cuckow
and
that
was
on
a
tree
right
faste
by
but
who
was
then
but
i
now
god
quoth
i
that
died
on
the
crois
give
sorrow
on
thee
and
on
thy
lewed
voice
full
little
joy
have
i
now
of
thy
cry
and
as
i
with
the
cuckoo
thus
gan
chide
i
heard
in
the
next
bush
beside
a
nightingale
so
lustily
sing
that
her
clear
voice
she
made
ring
through
all
the
greenwood
wide
ah
good
nightingale
quoth
i
then
a
little
hast
thou
been
too
long
hen
absent
for
here
hath
been
the
lewd
cuckow
and
sung
songs
than
hast
thou
i
pray
to
god
that
evil
fire
her
bren
but
now
i
will
you
tell
a
wondrous
thing
as
long
as
i
lay
in
that
swooning
me
thought
i
wist
what
the
birds
meant
and
what
they
said
and
what
was
their
intent
and
of
their
speech
i
hadde
good
knowing
there
heard
i
the
nightingale
say
now
good
cuckoo
go
somewhere
away
and
let
us
that
can
singe
dwelle
here
for
wight
thee
to
hear
thy
songes
be
so
elenge
in
good
fay
what
quoth
she
what
may
thee
all
now
it
thinketh
me
i
sing
as
well
as
thou
for
my
song
is
both
true
and
plain
although
i
can
not
so
in
vain
tremulously
as
thou
dost
in
thy
throat
i
wot
how
and
wight
may
understande
me
but
nightingale
so
may
they
not
do
thee
for
thou
hast
many
a
nice
cry
i
have
thee
heard
say
ocy
how
might
i
know
what
that
should
be
ah
fool
quoth
she
wost
thou
not
what
it
is
when
that
i
say
ocy
then
mean
i
that
i
woulde
wonder
fain
that
all
they
were
shamefully
slain
that
meanen
aught
againe
love
amiss
and
also
i
would
that
all
those
were
dead
that
thinke
not
in
love
their
life
to
lead
for
who
so
will
the
god
of
love
not
serve
i
dare
well
say
he
is
worthy
to
sterve
and
for
that
skill
ocy
i
grede
ey
quoth
the
cuckoo
this
is
a
law
that
every
wight
shall
love
or
be
to
pieces
but
i
forsake
alle
such
company
for
mine
intent
is
not
for
to
die
nor
ever
while
i
live
love
yoke
to
draw
put
on
for
lovers
be
the
folk
that
be
alive
that
most
disease
have
and
most
unthrive
and
most
endure
sorrow
woe
and
care
and
leaste
feelen
of
welfare
what
needeth
it
against
the
truth
to
strive
what
quoth
she
thou
art
all
out
of
thy
mind
how
mightest
thou
in
thy
churlishness
find
to
speak
of
love
servants
in
this
wise
for
in
this
world
is
none
so
good
service
to
wight
that
gentle
is
of
kind
for
thereof
truly
cometh
all
gladness
all
honour
and
all
gentleness
worship

and
all
hearte
lust
perfect
joy
and
full
assured
trust
jollity

and
freshness
lowlihead
largess
and
courtesy
seemelihead
and
true
company
dread
of
shame
for
to
do
amiss
for
he
that
truly
love
servant
is
were
to
be
shamed
than
to
die
reluctant
and
that
this
is
sooth
that
i
say
in
that
belief
i
will
live
and
dey
and
cuckoo
so
i
that
thou
do
then
quoth
he
let
me
never
have
bliss
if
ever
i
to
that
counsail
obey
nightingale
thou
speakest
wondrous
fair
but
for
all
that
is
the
sooth
contrair
for
love
is
in
young
folk
but
rage
and
in
old
folk
a
great
dotage
who
most
it
useth
moste
shall
enpair
harm
for
thereof
come
disease
and
heaviness
sorrow
and
care
and
many
a
great
sickness
despite
debate
anger
envy
depraving
shame
untrust
and
jealousy
of
fame
or
character
pride
mischief
povert
and
woodness
loving
is
an
office
of
despair
and
one
thing
is
therein
that
is
not
fair
for
who
that
gets
of
love
a
little
bliss
if
he
be
away
therewith
he
may
full
soon
of
age
have
his
hair
note
and
nightingale
therefore
hold
thee
nigh
for
me
well
for
all
thy
quainte
cry
if
thou
be
far
or
longe
from
thy
make
thou
shalt
be
as
other
that
be

and
then
thou
shalt
as
do
i
called

quoth
she
on
thy
name
and
on
thee
the
god
of
love
let
thee
never
the
for
thou
art
worse
a
thousand
fold
than

for
many
one
is
full
worthy
and
full
good
that
had
been
naught
ne
hadde
love
for
evermore
love
his
servants
amendeth
and
from
all
evile
them
defendeth
and
maketh
them
to
burn
right
in
a
fire
in
truth
and
in
desire
and
when
him
liketh
joy
enough
them
sendeth
thou
nightingale
he
said
be
still
for
love
hath
no
reason
but
his

for
ofttime
untrue
folk
he
easeth
and
true
folk
so
bitterly
displeaseth
that
for
default
of
he
lets
them
spill
ruined
then
took
i
of
the
nightingale
keep
how
she
cast
a
sigh
out
of
her
deep
and
said
alas
that
ever
i
was
bore
i
can
for
not
say
one
worde
more
grief
and
right
with
that
word
she
burst
out
to
weep
alas
quoth
she
my
hearte
will
to
heare
thus
this
lewd
bird
speak
of
love
and
of
his
worshipful
service
now
god
of
love
thou
help
me
in
some
wise
that
i
may
on
this
cuckoo
be
awreak
methought
then
i
start
up
anon
and
to
the
brook
i
ran
and
got
a
stone
and
at
the
cuckoo
heartly
cast
and
for
dread
he
flew
away
full
fast
and
glad
was
i
when
he
was
gone
and
evermore
the
cuckoo
as
he
flay
he
saide
farewell
farewell
popinjay
as
though
he
had
scorned
thought
me
but
ay
i
hunted
him
from
the
tree
until
he
was
far
out
of
sight
away
and
then
came
the
nightingale
to
me
and
said
friend
forsooth
i
thank
thee
that
thou
hast
lik
me
to
rescow
and
one
avow
to
love
make
i
now
that
all
this
may
i
will
thy
singer
be
i
thanked
her
and
was
right
apaid
yea
quoth
she
and
be
thou
not
dismay
though
thou
have
heard
the
cuckoo
me
for
if
i
live
it
shall
amended
be
the
next
may
if
i
be
not
afraid
and
one
thing
i
will
thee
also
believe
thou
not
the
cuckoo
the
love
foe
for
all
that
he
hath
said
is
strong
leasing
nay
quoth
i
thereto
shall
nothing
me
bring
for
love
and
it
hath
done
me
much
woe
yea
use
quoth
she
this
medicine
every
day
this
may
ere
thou
dine
go
look
upon
the
fresh
daisy
and
though
thou
be
for
woe
in
point
to
die
that
shall
full
greatly
less
thee
of
thy
pine
and
look
alway
that
thou
be
good
and
true
and
i
will
sing
one
of
my
songes
new
for
love
of
thee
as
loud
as
i
may
cry
and
then
she
began
this
song
full
high
i
all
them
that
be
of
love
untrue
and
when
she
had
sung
it
to
the
end
now
farewell
quoth
she
for
i
must
wend
and
god
of
love
that
can
right
well
and
may
as
much
joy
sende
thee
this
day
as
any
lover
yet
he
ever
send
thus
took
the
nightingale
her
leave
of
me
i
pray
to
god
alway
with
her
be
and
joy
of
love
he
send
her
evermore
and
shield
us
from
the
cuckoo
and
his
lore
for
there
is
not
so
false
a
bird
as
he
forth
she
flew
the
gentle
nightingale
to
all
the
birdes
that
were
in
that
dale
and
got
them
all
into
a
place
in
fere
and
besought
them
that
they
would
hear
her
disease
and
thus
began
her
tale
grievance
ye
well
it
is
not
for
to
hide
how
the
cuckoo
and
i
fast
have
chide
ever
since
that
it
was
daylight
i
pray
you
all
that
ye
do
me
right
on
that
foul
false
unkind
bride
then
spake
one
bird
for
all
by
one
assent
this
matter
asketh
good
advisement
for
we
be
fewe
birdes
here
in
fere
and
sooth
it
is
the
cuckoo
is
not
here
and
therefore
we
will
have
a
parlement
and
thereat
shall
the
eagle
be
our
lord
and
other
peers
that
been
record
established
and
the
cuckoo
shall
be
sent
there
shall
be
given
the
judgment
or
else
we
shall
finally
accord
and
this
shall
be
withoute
nay
the
morrow
after

is
fair
and
green
before
the
chamber
window
of
the
queen
at
woodstock
upon
the
green
lay
she
thanked
them
and
then
her
leave
took
and
into
a
hawthorn
by
that
brook
and
there
she
sat
and
sang
upon
that
tree
term
of
life
love
hath
withhold
me
hath
me
in
her
so
loude
that
i
with
that
song

your

of

notes
to

these
two
lines

of

whom
the

just
found

a

reading

ocy
ocy
is
supposed
to
come
from
the
latin
occidere
to
kill
or
rather
the
old
french
occire

the
doom
which
the

imprecates

supplicates

all
who
do

may
full
soon

bird

the
assembly
of
fowls
in
the
assembly
of
fowls
which
chaucer
retractation
describes
as
the
book
of
saint
valentine
day
or
of
the
parliament
of
birds
we
are
presented
with
a
picture
of
the
mediaeval
court
of
love
far
closer
to
the
reality
than
we
find
in
chaucer
poem
which
bears
that
express
title
we
have
a
regularly
constituted
conclave
or
tribunal
under
a
president
whose
decisions
are
final
a
difficult
question
is
proposed
for
the
consideration
and
judgment
of
the
court
the
disputants
advancing
and
vindicating
their
claims
in
person
the
attendants
upon
the
court
through
specially
chosen
mouthpieces
deliver
their
opinions
on
the
cause
and
finally
a
decision
is
authoritatively
pronounced
by
the
president
which
as
in
many
of
the
cases
actually
judged
before
the
courts
of
love
in
france
places
the
reasonable
and
modest
wish
of
a
sensitive
and
chaste
lady
above
all
the
eagerness
of
her
lovers
all
the
incongruous
counsels
of
representative
courtiers
so
far
therefore
as
the
poem
reproduces
the
characteristic
features
of
procedure
in
those
romantic
middle
age
halls
of
amatory
justice
chaucer
assembly
of
fowls
is
his
real
court
of
love
for
although
in
the
castle
and
among
the
courtiers
of
admetus
and
alcestis
we
have
all
the
personages
and
machinery
necessary
for
one
of
those
erotic
contentions
in
the
present
poem
we
see
the
personages
and
the
machinery
actually
at
work
upon
another
scene
and
under
other
guises
the
allegory
which
makes
the
contention
arise
out
of
the
loves
and
proceed
in
the
assembly
of
the
feathered
race
is
quite
in
keeping
with
the
fanciful
yet
spirit
of
the
poetry
of
chaucer
time
in
which
the
influence
of
the
troubadours
was
still
largely
present
it
is
quite
in
keeping
also
with
the
principles
that
regulated
the
courts
the
purpose
of
which
was
more
to
discuss
and
determine
the
proper
conduct
of
love
affairs
than
to
secure
conviction
or
acquittal
sanction
or
reprobation
in
particular
cases
though
the
jurisdiction
and
the
judgments
of
such
assemblies
often
closely
concerned
individuals
chaucer
introduces
us
to
his
main
theme
through
the
vestibule
of
a
fancied
dream
a
method
which
be
repeatedly
employs
with
great
relish
as
for
instance
in
the
house
of
fame
he
has
spent
the
whole
day
over
account
of
the
dream
of
scipio
africanus
the
younger
and
having
gone
to
bed
he
dreams
that
africanus
the
elder
appears
to
him
just
as
in
the
book
he
appeared
to
his
namesake
and
carries
him
into
a
beautiful
park
in
which
is
a
fair
garden
by
a
here
the
poet
is
led
into
a
splendid
temple
through
a
crowd
of
courtiers
allegorically
representing
the
various
instruments
pleasures
emotions
and
encouragements
of
love
and
in
the
temple
venus
herself
is
found
sporting
with
her
porter
richess
returning
into
the
garden
he
sees
the
goddess
of
nature
seated
on
a
hill
of
flowers
and
before
her
are
assembled
all
the
birds
for
it
is
saint
valentine
day
when
every
fowl
chooses
her
mate
having
with
a
graphic
touch
enumerated
and
described
the
principal
birds
the
poet
sees
that
on
her
hand
nature
bears
a
female
eagle
of
surpassing
loveliness
and
virtue
for
which
three
male
eagles
advance
contending
claims
the
disputation
lasts
all
day
and
at
evening
the
assembled
birds
eager
to
be
gone
with
their
mates
clamour
for
a
decision
the
tercelet
the
goose
the
cuckoo
and
the
turtle
for
birds
of
prey
and
respectively
pronounce
their
verdicts
on
the
dispute
in
speeches
full
of
character
and
humour
but
nature
refers
the
decision
between
the
three
claimants
to
the
female
eagle
herself
who
prays
that
she
may
have
a
year
respite
nature
grants
the
prayer
pronounces
judgment
accordingly
and
dismisses
the
assembly
and
after
a
chosen
choir
has
sung
a
roundel
in
honour
of
the
goddess
all
the
birds
fly
away
and
the
poet
awakes
it
is
probable
that
chaucer
derived
the
idea
of
the
poem
from
a
french
source
mr
bell
gives
the
outline
of
a
fabliau
of
which
three
versions
existed
and
in
which
a
contention
between
two
ladies
regarding
the
merits
of
their
respective
lovers
a
knight
and
a
clerk
is
decided
by
cupid
in
a
court
composed
of
birds
which
assume
their
sides
according
to
their
different
natures
whatever
the
source
of
the
idea
its
management
and
the
whole
workmanship
of
the
poem
especially
in
the
more
humorous
passages
are
essentially
chaucer
own
the
life
so
short
the
craft
so
long
to
learn
so
hard
so
sharp
the
conquering
the
dreadful
joy
alway
that
so
yern

all
this
mean
i
love

mattere
to
reade
forth

gan
me
so
delight
that
all
the
day
me
thought

but
a
lite
while
this
book
of
which
i
make
mention
entitled
was
right
thus
as
i
shall
tell
tullius
of
the
dream
of
scipion
chapters
seven
it
had
of
and
hell
and
earth
and
soules
that
therein
do
dwell
of
which
as
shortly
as
i
can
it
treat
of
his
sentence
i
will
you
say
the
great
part
first
telleth
it
when
scipio
was
come
to
africa
how
he
met
massinisse
that
him
for
joy
in
armes
hath
then
telleth
he
their
speech
and
all
the
bliss
that
was
between
them
till
the
day
gan
miss
and
how
his
ancestor
africane
so
dear
gan
in
his
sleep
that
night
to
him
appear
then
telleth
it
that
from
a
starry
place
how
africane
hath
him
carthage
and
warned
him
before
of
all
his
grace
and
said
him
what
man
learned
either
lewd
that
loveth
profit
well
public
he
should
unto
a
blissful
place
wend
where
as
the
joy
is
without
any
end
then
asked
he
if
folk
that
here
be
dead
the
younger
scipio
have
life
and
dwelling
in
another
place
and
africane
said
yea
withoute
dread
and
how
our
present
worldly
lives
space
meant
but
a
manner
death
what
way
we
trace
and
rightful
folk
should
go
after
they
die
to
and
showed
him
the
galaxy
then
show
he
him
the
little
earth
that
here
is
the
heaven
quantity
comparison
with
and
after
show
he
him
the
nine
spheres
and
after
that
the
melody
heard
he
that
cometh
of
those
spheres
thrice
three
that
wells
of
music
be
and
melody
in
this
world
here
and
cause
of
harmony
then
said
he
him
since
earthe
was
so
lite
and
full
of
torment
and
of
grace
fortune
that
he
should
not
him
in
this
world
delight
then
told
he
him
in
certain
yeares
space
that
star
should
come
into
his
place
where
it
was
first
and
all
should
of
mind
from
that
in
this
world
is
done
of
all
mankind
then
pray
him
scipio
to
tell
him
all
the
way
to
come
into
that
heaven
bliss
and
he
said
first
know
thyself
immortal
and
look
aye
busily
that
thou
work
and
affairs
to
common
profit
and
thou
shalt
not
miss
to
come
swiftly
unto
that
place
dear
that
full
of
bliss
is
and
of
soules
clear
and
breakers
of
the
law
the
sooth
to
sayn
and
folk
after
that
they
be
dead
shall
whirl
about
the
world
always
in
pain
till
many
a
world
be
passed
of
dread
and
then
forgiven
all
their
wicked
deed
they
shalle
come
unto
that
blissful
place
to
which
to
come
god

sende
grace
the
day
gan
failen
and
the
darke
night
that
beastes
from
their
business

book
for
lack
of
light
and
to
my

and
busy
heaviness
for
both
i
hadde
thing
which

eke
i
had

that
thing
that

but
finally
my
spirit
at
the
last
of
my

all
that
day
wearied
took
rest
that
made
me
to
sleepe
fast
and
in

stood
right
at

sleeping
in
his

made
me
to
mette
that

thus
said
he
thou

and
endite
down
this
foresaid
africane
me
anon
and
forth
with
him
unto
a
gate
brought
right
of
a
park
walled
with
greene
stone
and
the
gate
with
letters
large
there
were
verses
written
as
me
thought
on
either
half
of
full
great
difference
of
which
i
shall
you
say
the
plain
sentence
through

off
cast
all
open

i
pass
in

speed
thee
fast
through
me
men
go
thus
spake
the
other
side
unto
the
mortal
strokes
of
the
spear
of
which
disdain
and
danger
is
the
guide
there
never
tree
shall

bear
this

you
leadeth
to
the
sorrowful
weir
where
as
the
fish
in

is
the
only

these
verses
of
gold
and
azure
written
were
on

my

the

natheless
in

my

that
day
that

since
none
loveth
her
so

although
she
never
of

behet
then
ought
she
to
be
mine
through

can
i
none
on

can
bind
her
no
other
for

never

i
fail
to
serve
her
how
far
so
that

list
my

is
at
an
end
right
as
the
freshe
redde

colour
is
right
so
for
shame
all
waxen
gan
the

of
this

when
she
had
heard
all
this
she

well
nor
said
amiss
answered
nothing
so
sore
abashed
was
she
till

either
well

said
daughter
dread

anon
of

said
that

john
or
at

i
love
her
as

and
if
she
should
have

for

alone
had
been
the
guerdoning
i
dare
eke
say
if

and
from
the

gan
these

last
till
downward
went
the
sunne
wonder
fast
the
noise
of
fowles
for
to
be
free
to
depart
so
loude
rang
have
done
and
let
us
wend
that
well
ween
i
the

had
all
shaken
to
come
off
they
cried
alas
ye
will
us
shend
when
will
your
cursed
pleading
have
an

how
should
a

either
party
believe
for

withouten
any
preve
the
goose
the
duck
and
the
cuckoo
also
so
cried
keke
keke
cuckoo
queke
queke
high
that
through
mine
ears
the
noise
wente
tho
the
goose
said
then
all
this
worth
a
fly
but
i
can
shape
hereof
a
remedy
and
i
will
say
my
verdict
fair
and
swith
for
whoso
be
wroth
or
blith
and
i
for
said
the
fool
cuckow
for
i
will
of
mine
own
authority
for
common
speed
take
on
me
the
charge
now
for
to
deliver
us
is
great
charity
ye
may
abide
a
while
yet
pardie
god
quoth
then
the
turtle
if
it
be
your
will
a
wight
may
speak
it
were
as
good
be
still
i
am
a
one
that
know
i
well
and
the
least
of
cunning
but
better
is
that
a
wight
tongue
rest
than
him
such
doing
of
which
he
neither
can
nor
sing
and
who
it
doth
full
foul
himself
accloyeth
for
office
uncommanded
oft
annoyeth
nature
which
that
alway
had
an
ear
to
murmur
of
the
lewedness
behind
with
voice
said
hold
your
tongues
there
fluent
and
i
shall
soon
i
hope
a
counsel
find
you
to
deliver
and
from
this
noise
unbind
i
charge
of
ye
shall
one
call
of
fowl
to
say
the
verdict
of
you
fowles
all
the
said
then
in
this
mannere
hawk
full
hard
it
were
to
prove
it
by
reason
who
loveth
best
this
gentle
formel
here
for
hath
such
replication
that
by
may
none
be
brought
adown
i
can
not
see
that
arguments
avail
then
seemeth
it
that
there
must
be
battaile
all
ready
quoth
those
eagle
tercels
tho
nay
sirs
quoth
he
if
that
i
durst
it
say
ye
do
me
wrong
my
tale
is
not
for
sirs
and
it
not
agrief
i
pray
not
it
may
not
be
as
ye
would
in
this
way
ours
is
the
voice
that
have
the
charge
in
hand
and
the
judges
doom
ye
muste
stand
must
abide
by
the
judges
and
therefore
i
say
as
to
my
wit
me
woulde
think
how
that
the
worthiest
of
knighthood
and
had
longest
used
it
most
of
estate
of
blood
the
gentilest
were
fitting
most
for
her
that
her
lest
she
and
of
these
three
she
knows
herself
i
trow
sure
which
that
he
be
for
it
is
to
know
the
have
their
heades
laid
together
and
short
advisement
brief
when
evereach
his
verdict
had
they
saide
soothly
all
by
one
assent
how
that
the
goose
with
the
gent
that
so
desired
to
pronounce
our
need
business
shall
tell
our
tale
and
prayed
god
her
speed
and
for
those
then
began
the
goose
to
speak
and
in
her
cackeling
she
saide
peace
now
take
man
and
hearken
what
reason
i
shall
forth
bring
my
wit
is
sharp
i
love
no
tarrying
i
say
i
rede
him
though
he
were
my
brother
she
will
love
him
let
him
love
another
lo
here
a
perfect
reason
of
a
goose
quoth
the
sperhawke
never
may
she
the
lo
such
a
thing
is
a
tongue
loose
now
pardie
fool
yet
were
it
for
thee
have
held
thy
peace
than
show
thy
nicety
it
lies
not
in
his
wit
nor
in
his
will
but
sooth
is
said
a
fool
can
not
be
still
the
laughter
rose
of
gentle
fowles
all
and
right
anon
the
chosen
had
the
turtle
true
and
gan
her
to
them
call
and
prayed
her
to
say
the
of
this
mattere
and
asked
what
she
rad
and
she
answer
that
plainly
her
intent
she
woulde
show
and
soothly
what
she
meant
nay
god
forbid
a
lover
shoulde
change
the
turtle
said
and
wax
for
shame
all
red
though
that
his
lady
evermore
be
strange
yet
let
him
serve
her
ay
till
he
be
dead
for
sooth
i
praise
not
the
goose
for
though
she
died
i
would
none
other
make
i
will
be
hers
till
that
the
death
me
take
well
bourded
quoth
the
ducke
by
my
hat
pretty
joke
that
men
should
loven
alway
causeless
who
can
a
reason
find
or
wit
in
that
danceth
he
merry
that
is
mirtheless
who
shoulde
of
that
is
reckeless
for
one
who
has
yea
queke
yet
quoth
the
duck
full
well
and
fair
no
care
for
there
be
more
starres
god
wot
than
a
pair
now
fy
churl
quoth
the
gentle
tercelet
out
of
the
dunghill
came
that
word
aright
thou
canst
not
see
which
thing
is
well
beset
thou
by
love
as
owles
do
by
light
the
day
them
blinds
full
well
they
see
by
night
thy
kind
is
of
so
low
a
wretchedness
that
what
love
is
thou
caust
not
see
nor
guess
then
gan
the
cuckoo
put
him
forth
in
press
the
crowd
for
fowl
that
eateth
worm
and
said
belive
so
i
quoth
he
may
have
my
mate
in
peace
i
recke
not
how
longe
that
they
strive
let
each
of
them
be
all
their
life
this
is
my
rede
since
they
may
not
accord
this
shorte
lesson
needeth
not
record
yea
have
the
glutton
fill
enough
his
paunch
then
are
we
well
saide
the
emerlon
thou
of
the
heggsugg
on
the
branch
that
brought
thee
forth
thou
most
rueful
glutton
live
thou
solain
worme
corruption
no
force
is
to
lack
of
thy
nature
loss
of
a
bird
of
your
go
lewed
be
thou
while
the
world
may
dare
depraved
nature
is
no
matter
of
regret
now
peace
quoth
nature
i
commande
here
for
i
have
heard
all
your
opinion
and
in
effect
yet
be
we
the
nere
but
finally
this
is
my
conclusion
that
she
herself
shall
have
her
election
of
whom
her
list
whoso
be
or
blith
or
him
that
she
chooseth
he
shall
her
have
as
swith
for
since
it
may
not
here
discussed
be
who
loves
her
best
as
said
the
tercelet
then
will
i
do
this
favour
t
her
that
she
shall
have
right
him
on
whom
her
heart
is
set
and
he
her
that
his
heart
hath
on
her
knit
this
judge
i
nature
i
may
not
lie
to
none
estate
i
none
other
eye
see
the
matter
in
no
other
but
as
for
counsel
for
to
choose
a
make
if
i
were
reason
certes
then
would
i
counsaile
you
the
royal
tercel
take
as
saith
the
tercelet
full
skilfully
as
for
the
gentilest
and
most
worthy
which
i
have
wrought
so
well
to
my
pleasance
that
to
you
it
ought
be
suffisance
your
with
voice
the
formel
her
answer
my
rightful
lady
goddess
of
nature
sooth
is

out
of
the
nest
who

loves

the
refrain
of
the
roundel

the
duty
of
constancy
which
has
been
imposed
on

tercels
by
the
decision
of

court
the
flower
and
the
leaf
the
flower
and
the
leaf
is
one
of
those
poems
by
which
chaucer
may
be
triumphantly
defended
against
the
charge
of
licentious
coarseness
that
founded
upon
his
faithful
representation
of
the
manners
customs
and
daily
life
and
speech
of
his
own
time
in
the
canterbury
tales
are
sweepingly
advanced
against
his
works
at
large
in
an
allegory
rendered
perhaps
somewhat
cumbrous
by
the
detail
of
chivalric
ceremonial
and
the
heraldic
minuteness
which
entered
so
liberally
into
poetry
as
into
the
daily
life
of
the
classes
for
whom
poetry
was
then
written
chaucer
beautifully
enforces
the
lasting
advantages
of
purity
valour
and
faithful
love
and
the
fleeting
and
disappointing
character
of
mere
idle
pleasure
of
sloth
and
listless
retirement
from
the
battle
of
life
in
the
season
sweet
of
spring
which
the
great
singer
of
middle
age
england
loved
so
well
a
gentle
woman
is
supposed
to
seek
sleep
in
vain
to
rise
about
the
springing
of
the
gladsome
day
and
by
an
unfrequented
path
in
a
pleasant
grove
to
arrive
at
an
arbour
beside
the
arbour
stands
a
in
which
a
goldfinch
sings
passing
sweetly
and
the
nightingale
answers
from
a
green
laurel
tree
with
so
merry
and
ravishing
a
note
that
the
lady
resolves
to
proceed
no
farther
but
sit
down
on
the
grass
to
listen
suddenly
the
sound
of
many
voices
singing
surprises
her
and
she
sees
a
world
of
ladies
emerge
from
a
grove
clad
in
white
and
wearing
garlands
of
laurel
of
agnus
castus
and
woodbind
one
who
wears
a
crown
and
bears
a
branch
of
agnus
castus
in
her
hand
begins
a
roundel
in
honour
of
the
leaf
which
all
the
others
take
up
dancing
and
singing
in
the
meadow
before
the
arbour
soon
to
the
sound
of
thundering
trumps
and
attended
by
a
splendid
and
warlike
retinue
enter
nine
knights
in
white
crowned
like
the
ladies
and
after
they
have
jousted
an
hour
and
more
they
alight
and
advance
to
the
ladies
each
dame
takes
a
knight
by
the
hand
and
all
incline
reverently
to
the
laurel
tree
which
they
encompass
singing
of
love
and
dancing
soon
preceded
by
a
band
of
minstrels
out
of
the
open
field
comes
a
lusty
company
of
knights
and
ladies
in
green
crowned
with
chaplets
of
flowers
and
they
do
reverence
to
a
tuft
of
flowers
in
the
middle
of
the
meadow
while
one
of
their
number
sings
a
bergerette
in
praise
of
the
daisy
but
now
it
is
high
noon
the
sun
waxes
fervently
hot
the
flowers
lose
their
beauty
and
wither
with
the
heat
the
ladies
in
green
are
scorched
the
knights
faint
for
lack
of
shade
then
a
strong
wind
beats
down
all
the
flowers
save
such
as
are
protected
by
the
leaves
of
hedges
and
groves
and
a
mighty
storm
of
rain
and
hail
drenches
the
ladies
and
knights
shelterless
in
the
now
flowerless
meadow
the
storm
overpast
the
company
in
white
whom
the
has
safely
shielded
from
heat
and
storm
advance
to
the
relief
of
the
others
and
when
their
clothes
have
been
dried
and
their
wounds
from
sun
and
storm
healed
all
go
together
to
sup
with
the
queen
in
white
on
whose
hand
as
they
pass
by
the
arbour
the
nightingale
perches
while
the
goldfinch
flies
to
the
lady
of
the
flower
the
pageant
gone
the
gentlewoman
quits
the
arbour
and
meets
a
lady
in
white
who
at
her
request
unfolds
the
hidden
meaning
of
all
that
she
has
seen
which
says
speght
quaintly
is
this
they
which
honour
the
flower
a
thing
fading
with
every
blast
are
such
as
look
after
beauty
and
worldly
pleasure
but
they
that
honour
the
leaf
which
abideth
with
the
root
notwithstanding
the
frosts
and
winter
storms
are
they
which
follow
virtue
and
during
qualities
without
regard
of
worldly
respects
mr
bell
in
his
edition
has
properly
noticed
that
there
is
no
explanation
of
the
emblematical
import
of
the
the
goldfinch
and
the
nightingale
but
he
says
as
the
fruit
of
the
medlar
to
use
chaucer
own
expression
see
prologue
to
the
reeve
tale
is
rotten
before
it
is
ripe
it
may
be
the
emblem
of
sensual
pleasure
which
palls
before
it
confers
real
enjoyment
the
goldfinch
is
remarkable
for
the
beauty
of
its
plumage
the
sprightliness
of
its
movements
and
its
gay
tinkling
song
and
may
be
supposed
to
represent
the
showy
and
unsubstantial
character
of
frivolous
pleasures
the
sober
outward
appearance
and
impassioned
song
denote
greater
depth
of
feeling
the
poem
throughout
is
marked
by
the
purest
and
loftiest
moral
tone
and
it
amply
deserved
dryden
special
recommendation
both
for
the
invention
and
the
moral
it
is
given
without
abridgement
transcriber
note
modern
scholars
believe
that
chaucer
was
not
the
author
of
this
poem
when
that
phoebus
his
car
of
gold
so
high
had
whirled
up
the
starry
sky
aloft
and
in
the
bull
enter
certainly
when
showers
sweet
of
rain
descended
soft
causing
the
grounde
times
and
oft
up
for
to
give
many
a
wholesome
air
and
every
plain
was
fair
with
newe
green
and
maketh
smalle
to
springe
here
and
there
in
field
and
mead
so
very
good
and
wholesome
be
the
that
they
renewe
what
was
old
and
dead
in
winter
time
and
out
of
seed
springeth
the
herbe
so
that
wight
of
season
waxeth
glad
and
light
and
i
so
glad
of
thilke
season
sweet
was
upon
a
certain
night
as
i
lay
in
my
bed
sleep
full
uncompliant
was
unto
me
but
why
that
i
not
might
rest
i
not
wist
for
there
earthly
wight
not
as
i
suppose
had
more
hearte
ease
than
i
for
i
sickness
nor
disease
not
wherefore
i
marvel
greatly
of
myself
that
i
so
long
withoute
sleepe
lay
and
up
i
rose
three
houres
after
twelf
about
the
springing
of
the
gladsome
day
and
on
i
put
my
and
mine
array
and
to
a
pleasant
grove
i
gan
to
pass
long
ere
the
brighte
sun
uprisen
was
in
which
were
oakes
great
straight
as
a
line
under
the
which
the
grass
so
fresh
of
hue
was
newly
sprung
and
an
eight
foot
or
nine
every
tree
well
from
his
fellow
grew
with
branches
broad
laden
with
leaves
new
that
sprangen
out
against
the
sunne
sheen
some
very
red
and
some
a
glad
light
green
which
as
me
thought
was
right
a
pleasant
sight
and
eke
the
birdes
songes
for
to
hear
would
have
rejoiced
any
earthly
wight
and
i
that
could
not
yet
in
no
mannere
heare
the
nightingale
all
the
year
full
busy
hearkened
with
heart
and
ear
if
i
her
voice
perceive
could
anywhere
and
at
the
last
a
path
of
little
i
found
that
greatly
had
not
used
be
for
it
was
with
grass
and
weed
that
well
a
wight
mighte
see
thought
i
this
path
some
whither
goes
pardie
a
surety
and
so
i
follow
it
till
it
me
brought
to
a
right
pleasant
arbour
well
that
benched
was
and
all
with
turfes
new
freshly
whereof
the
greene
grass
so
small
so
thick
so
short
so
fresh
of
hue
that
most
like
to
green
wool
i
wot
it
was
the
hedge
also
that
in
compass
all
around
and
closed
in
all
the
greene
herbere
with
sycamore
was
set
and
eglatere
wreathed
so
well
and
cunningly
that
branch
and
leaf
grew
measure
plain
as
a
board
of
height
by
and
by
same
height
side
i
saw
never
a
thing
i
you
ensure
by
so
well
for
he
that
took
the
care
to
maken
it
i
trow
did
all
his
pain
to
make
it
pass
all
those
that
men
have
seen
and
shapen
was
this
arbour
roof
and
all
as
is
a
pretty
parlour
and
also
the
hedge
as
thick
was
as
a
castle
wall
that
whoso
list
without
to
stand
or
go
though
he
would
all
day
pryen
to
and
fro
he
should
not
see
if
there
were
any
wight
within
or
no
but
one
within
well
might
perceive
all
those
that
wente
there
without
into
the
field
that
was
on
side
cover
with
corn
and
grass
that
out
of
doubt
though
one
would
seeken
all
the
worlde
wide
so
rich
a
fielde
could
not
be
espied
upon
no
coast
of
the
quantity
its
abundance
for
of
all
goode
thing
there
was
plenty
or
and
i
that
all
this
pleasant
sight
did
see
thought
suddenly
i
felt
so
sweet
an
air
of
the
eglentere
that
certainly
there
is
no
heart
i
deem
in
such
despair
nor
yet
with
thoughtes
froward
and
contrair
so
overlaid
but
it
should
soon
have
boot
if
it
had
ones
felt
this
swoot
and
as
i
stood
and
cast
aside
mine
eye
i
was
ware
of
the
fairest
medlar
tree
that
ever
yet
in
all
my
life
i
seye
as
full
of
blossoms
as
it
mighte
be
therein
a
goldfinch
leaping
prettily
from
bough
to
bough
and
as
him
list
he
eat
here
and
there
of
the
buds
and
flowers
sweet
and
to
the
arbour
side
was
adjoining
this
fairest
tree
of
which
i
have
you
told
and
at
the
last
the
bird
began
to
sing
when
he
had
eaten
what
he
eate
so
passing
sweetly
that
by
many
fold
it
was
more
pleasant
than
i
could
devise
describe
and
when
his
song
was
ended
in
this
wise
the
nightingale
with
so
merry
a
note
answered
him
that
all
the
woode
rung
so
suddenly
that
it
were
a
sote
a
fool
i
stood
astound
so
was
i
with
the
song
thorough
ravished
that
late
and
long
a
long
i
wist
not
in
what
place
i
was
nor
where
again
me
thought
she
sung
by
mine
ear
wherefore
i
waited
about
busily
on
side
if
that
i
might
her
see
and
at
the
last
i
gan
full
well
espy
where
she
sat
in
a
fresh
green
laurel
tree
on
the
further
side
even
right
by
me
that
gave
so
passing
a
delicious
smell
the
eglantere
full
well
whereof
i
had
so
inly
great
pleasure
that
as
me
thought
i
surely
ravish
was
into
paradise
where
as
my
desire
was
for
to
be
and
no
farther
to
pass
as
for
that
day
and
on
the
sweete
grass
i
sat
me
down
for
for
mine
intent
my
the
birde
song
was
more
to
my
and
more
pleasant
to
me
by
many
fold
than
meat
or
drink
or
any
other
thing
thereto
the
arbour
was
so
fresh
and
cold
the
wholesome
savours
eke
so
comforting
that
as
i
deemed
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
was
there
never
seen
so
pleasant
a
ground
of
none
earthly
man
and
as
i
sat
the
birdes
thus
me
thought
that
i
heard
voices
suddenly
the
most
sweetest
and
most
delicious
that
ever
any
wight
i
truely
heard
in
their
life
for
the
harmony
and
sweet
accord
was
in
so
good
musike
that
the
voices
to
angels
most
were
like
at
the
last
out
of
a
grove
even
by
that
was
right
goodly
and
pleasant
to
sight
i
saw
where
there
came
singing
lustily
a
world
of
ladies
but
to
tell
aright
their
greate
beauty
lies
not
in
my
might
nor
their
array
nevertheless
i
shall
tell
you
a
part
though
i
speak
not
of
all
in
white
of
velvet
well
fitting
robes
they
were
clad
and
the
seames
each
one
as
it
were
a
mannere
of
garnishing
was
set
with
emeraldes
one
and
one
and
by
but
many
a
riche
stone
a
was
set
upon
the
purfles
out
of
doubt
edges
of
collars
sleeves
and
traines
round
about
as
greate
pearles
round
and
orient
and
diamondes
fine
and
rubies
red
and
many
another
stone
of
which
i
can
not
recall
the
names
now
and
on
her
head
had
a
rich
of
gold
which
without
dread
was
full
of
riche
stones
set
noble
and
lady
had
a
chapelet
upon
her
head
of
branches
fresh
and
green
so
well
and
so
marvellously
that
it
was
a
right
noble
sight
to
some
of
laurel
and
some
full
pleasantly
had
chapelets
of
woodbine
and
sadly
some
of
agnus
castus
wearen
also
chapelets
fresh
but
there
were
many
of
that
danced
and
eke
sung
full
soberly
and
all
they
went
manner
of
compass
a
but
one
there
went
in
mid
the
company
sole
by
herself
but
all
follow
the
pace
that
she
kept
whose
heavenly
figur
face
so
pleasant
was
and
her
well
shap
person
that
in
beauty
she
pass
them
one
and
more
richly
beseen
by
many
fold
she
was
also
in
manner
thing
upon
her
head
full
pleasant
to
behold
a
crown
of
golde
rich
for
any
king
a
branch
of
agnus
castus
eke
bearing
in
her
hand
and
to
my
sight
truely
she
lady
was
of
all
that
company
and
she
began
a
roundell
lustily
that
suse
le
foyle
devers
moi
men
call
siene
et
mon
joly
coeur
est
endormy
and
then
the
company
answered
all
with
voices
sweet
entuned
and
so
small
that
me
thought
it
the
sweetest
melody
that
ever
i
heard
in
my
life
soothly
and
thus
they
came
dancing
and
singing
into
the
middest
of
the
mead
each
one
before
the
arbour
where
i
was
sitting
and
god
wot
me
thought
i
was
for
then
i
might
them
one
by
one
who
fairest
was
who
best
could
dance
or
sing
or
who
most
womanly
was
in
all
thing
they
had
not
danced
but
a
throw
when
that
i
hearde
far
off
suddenly
so
great
a
noise
of
trumpets
blow
as
though
it
should
have
the
sky
divide
and
after
that
within
a
while
i
sigh
from
the
same
grove
where
the
ladies
came
out
of
men
of
armes
coming
such
a
rout
all
the
men
on
earth
had
been
assembled
if
unto
that
place
well
horsed
for
the
stirring
so
fast
that
all
the
earthe
trembled
but
for
to
speak
of
riches
and
of
stones
and
men
and
horse
i
trow
the
large
jewels
of
prester
john
nor
all
his
treasury
might
not
have
bought
the
tenth
of
their
array
whoso
list
heare
more
i
shall
rehearse
so
as
i
can
a
lite
out
of
the
grove
that
i
spake
of
before
i
saw
come
first
all
in
their
cloakes
white
a
company
that
wore
for
their
delight
chapelets
fresh
of
oake
cerrial
newly
and
were
they
all
on
trump
hanging
a
broad
bannere
of
fine
tartarium
was
full
richly
beat
with
gold
every
trumpet
his
lord
armes
bare
about
their
necks
with
greate
pearles
set
were
collars
broad
for
cost
they
would
not
let
hindered
by
as
it
would
seem
for
their
scutcheons
each
one
were
set
about
with
many
a
precious
stone
their
horses
harness
was
all
white
also
and
after
them
next
in
one
company
came
kinges
at
armes
and
no
mo
in
cloakes
of
white
cloth
with
gold
richly
chaplets
of
green
upon
their
heads
on
high
the
crownes
that
they
on
their
scutcheons
bare
were
set
with
pearl
and
ruby
and
sapphire
and
eke
great
diamondes
many
one
but
all
their
horse
harness
and
other
gear
was
in
a
suit
according
one
as
ye
have
heard
the
foresaid
trumpets
were
and
by
seeming
they
nothing
to
lear
nothing
to
and
their
guiding
they
did
all
mannerly
and
after
them
came
a
great
company
of
heraldes
and
pursuivantes
eke
arrayed
in
clothes
of
white
velvet
and
hardily
they
were
no
thing
to
seek
assuredly
how
they
on
them
shoulde
the
harness
set
and
man
had
on
a
chapelet
scutcheones
and
eke
harness
indeed
they
had
suit
them
that
them
yede
next
after
them
in
came
in
armour
bright
all
save
their
heades
seemly
knightes
nine
and
clasp
and
nail
as
to
my
sight
of
their
harness
was
of
red
golde
fine
with
cloth
of
gold
and
furred
with
ermine
were
the
of
their
steedes
strong
both
wide
and
large
that
to
the
grounde
hung
and
boss
of
bridle
and
breastplate
that
they
had
on
was
worth
as
i
would
ween
a
thousand
pound
and
on
their
heades
well
dressed
were
crownes
of
the
laurel
green
the
beste
made
that
ever
i
had
seen
and
knight
had
after
him
riding
three
upon
him
awaiting
of
which
first
on
a
short
truncheon
his
lorde
helmet
bare
so
richly
dight
that
the
worst
of
them
was
worthy
the
of
any
king
the
second
a
shielde
bright
bare
at
his
back
the
thirde
bare
upright
a
mighty
spear
full
sharp
and
keen
and
ware
of
leaves
green
a
freshe
chaplet
on
his
haires
bright
and
cloakes
white
of
fine
velvet
they
ware
their
steedes
trapped
and
arrayed
right
without
difference
as
their
lordes
were
and
after
them
on
many
a
fresh
courser
there
came
of
armed
knightes
such
a
rout
crowd
that
they
bespread
the
large
field
about
and
all
they
waren
after
their
degrees
chapelets
newe
made
of
laurel
green
some
of
the
oak
and
some
of
other
trees
some
in
their
handes
bare
boughes
sheen
some
of
laurel
and
some
of
oakes
keen
some
of
hawthorn
and
some
of
the
woodbind
and
many
more
which
i
had
not
in
mind
and
so
they
came
their
horses
fresh
stirring
with
bloody
soundes
of
their
trumpets
loud
there
saw
i
many
an
in
the
array
of
these
knightes
proud
and
at
the
last
as
evenly
as
they
could
they
took
their
place
in
middest
of
the
mead
and
knight
turned
his
horse
head
to
his
fellow
and
lightly
laid
a
spear
into
the
rest
and
so
the
jousts
began
on
part
aboute
here
and
there
some
brake
his
spear
some
threw
down
horse
and
man
about
the
field
astray
the
steedes
ran
and
to
behold
their
rule
and
governance
i
you
ensure
it
was
a
great
pleasuance
and
so
the
joustes
an
hour
and
more
but
those
that
crowned
were
in
laurel
green
wonne
the
prize
their
were
so
sore
that
there
was
none
against
them
might
sustene
and
the
jousting
was
alle
left
off
clean
and
from
their
horse
the
nine
alight
anon
and
so
did
all
the
remnant
one
and
forth
they
went
together
twain
and
twain
that
to
behold
it
was
a
worthy
sight
toward
the
ladies
on
the
greene
plain
that
sang
and
danced
as
i
said
now
right
the
ladies
as
soon
as
they
goodly
might
they
brake
off
both
the
song
and
eke
the
dance
and
went
to
meet
them
with
full
glad
semblance
aspect
and
lady
took
full
womanly
by
a
knight
and
so
forth
right
they
unto
a
fair
laurel
that
stood
fast
by
with
leaves
lade
the
boughs
of
greate
brede
and
to
my
doom
there
never
was
indeed
man
that
had
seene
half
so
fair
a
tree
for
underneath
it
there
might
well
have
a
hundred
persons
their
own
pleasance
perfect
shadowed
from
the
heat
of
phoebus
bright
so
that
they
shoulde
have
felt
no
of
rain
nor
haile
that
them
hurte
might
the
savour
eke
rejoice
would
any
wight
that
had
been
sick
or
melancholious
it
was
so
very
good
and
virtuous
of
healing
virtues
and
with
great
they
inclined
low
unto
the
tree
so
sweet
and
fair
of
hue
and
after
that
within
a
throw
they
all
began
to
sing
and
dance
of
new
some
song
of
love
some
of
untrue
of
the
tree
that
stood
upright
and
ever
went
a
lady
and
a
knight
round
and
at
the
last
i
cast
mine
eye
aside
and
was
ware
of
a
lusty
company
that
came
roaming
out
of
the
fielde
wide
and
hand
in
hand
a
knight
and
a
lady
the
ladies
all
in
surcoats
that
richly
were
with
many
a
riche
stone
at
the
borders
and
knight
of
green
ware
mantles
on
embroider
well
so
as
the
surcoats
were
and
had
a
chaplet
on
her
head
which
did
right
well
upon
the
shining
hair
maked
of
goodly
flowers
white
and
red
the
knightes
eke
that
they
in
hande
led
in
suit
of
them
ware
chaplets
one
and
them
before
went
minstrels
many
one
as
harpes
pipes
lutes
and
psaltry
all
clad
in
green
and
on
their
heades
bare
of
divers
flowers
made
full
craftily
all
in
a
suit
goodly
chaplets
they
ware
and
so
dancing
into
the
mead
they
fare
in
mid
the
which
they
found
a
tuft
that
was
all
overspread
with
flowers
in
in
a
circle
whereunto
they
inclined
one
with
great
reverence
and
that
full
humbly
and
at
the
last
there
then
began
anon
a
lady
for
to
sing
right
womanly
a
bargaret
in
praising
the
daisy
for
as
me
thought
among
her
notes
sweet
she
saide
si
douce
est
la
margarete
then
alle
they
answered
her
in
so
passingly
well
and
so
pleasantly
that
it
was
a
most
blissful
noise
to
hear
but
i
how
it
happen
suddenly
not
as
about
noon
the
sun
so
fervently
wax
hote
that
the
pretty
tender
had
lost
the
beauty
of
their
fresh
colours
with
heat
the
ladies
eke
burnt
that
they
knew
not
where
they
might
them
bestow
the
knightes
swelt
for
lack
of
shade
nigh
and
after
that
within
a
little
throw
the
wind
began
so
sturdily
to
blow
that
down
went
all
the
flowers
one
so
that
in
all
the
mead
there
left
not
one
save
such
as
succour
were
among
the
leaves
from
storm
that
mighte
them
assail
growing
under
the
hedges
and
thick
greves
boughs
and
after
that
there
came
a
storm
of
hail
and
rain
in
fere
so
that
withoute
fail
the
ladies
nor
the
knights
had
not
one
thread
dry
on
them
so
dropping
was
all
their
weed
and
when
the
storm
was
passed
clean
away
those
in
the
white
that
stood
under
the
tree
they
felt
no
thing
of
all
the
great
affray
that
they
in
green
without
in
been
to
them
they
went
for
ruth
and
for
pity
them
to
comfort
after
their
great
disease
so
they
were
the
helpless
for
to
ease
eager
then
i
was
ware
how
one
of
them
in
green
had
on
a
crowne
rich
and
well
sitting
wherefore
i
deemed
well
she
was
a
queen
and
those
in
green
on
her
were
awaiting
attendance
the
ladies
then
in
white
that
were
coming
toward
them
and
the
knightes
eke
fere
began
to
comfort
them
and
make
them
cheer
the
queen
in
white
that
was
of
great
beauty
took
by
the
hand
the
queen
that
was
in
green
and
saide
sister
i
have
great
pity
of
your
annoy
and
of
your
troublous
teen
grief
wherein
you
and
your
company
have
been
so
long
alas
and
if
that
it
you
please
to
go
with
me
i
shall
you
do
the
ease
in
all
the
pleasure
that
i
can
or
may
whereof
the
other
humbly
as
she
might
thanked
her
for
in
right
evil
array
she
was
with
storm
and
heat
i
you
behight
arid
lady
then
anon
aright
that
were
in
white
one
of
them
took
in
green
by
the
hand
which
when
that
the
knights
had
seen
in
like
mannere
each
of
them
took
a
knight
in
green
and
forth
with
them
they
fare
unto
a
hedge
where
that
they
anon
right
to
make
their
joustes
they
would
not
spare
boughes
to
hewe
down
and
eke
trees
square
wherewith
they
made
them
stately
fires
great
to
dry
their
clothes
that
were
wringing
wet
and
after
that
of
herbes
that
there
grew
they
made
for
blisters
of
the
sun
burning
ointmentes
very
good
wholesome
and
new
wherewith
they
went
the
sick
fast
anointing
and
after
that
they
went
about
pleasant
salades
which
they
made
them
eat
for
to
refresh
their
great
unkindly
heat
the
lady
of
the
leaf
then
gan
to
pray
her
of
the
flower
for
so
to
my
seeming
they
should
be
called
as
by
their
array
to
sup
with
her
and
eke
for
anything
that
she
should
with
her
all
her
people
bring
and
she
again
in
right
goodly
mannere
thanked
her
fast
of
her
most
friendly
cheer
saying
plainely
that
she
would
obey
with
all
her
heart
all
her
commandement
and
then
anon
without
longer
delay
the
lady
of
the
leaf
hath
one
to
bring
a
palfrey
her
intent
to
her
arrayed
well
in
fair
harness
of
gold
for
nothing
lack
that
him
longe
belong
to
and
after
that
to
all
her
company
she
made
to
horse
and
that
they
needed
and
then
full
lustily
by
the
arbour
where
i
was
sitting
they
passed
all
so
merrily
singing
that
it
would
have
comforted
any
wight
but
then
i
saw
a
passing
wondrous
sight
for
then
the
nightingale
that
all
the
day
had
in
the
laurel
sat
and
did
her
might
the
whole
service
to
sing
longing
to
may
all
suddenly
began
to
take
her
flight
and
to
the
lady
of
the
leaf
forthright
she
flew
and
set
her
on
her
hand
softly
which
was
a
thing
i
marvell
at
greatly
the
goldfinch
eke
that
from
the
medlar
tree
was
fled
for
heat
into
the
bushes
cold
unto
the
lady
of
the
flower
gan
flee
and
on
her
hand
he
set
him
as
he
and
pleasantly
his
winges
gan
to
fold
and
for
to
sing
they
both
as
sore
great
as
they
had
done
the
day
before
and
so
these
ladies
rode
forth
great
pace
and
all
the
rout
of
knightes
eke
in
fere
and
i
that
had
seen
all
this
case
thought
that
i
would
assay
in
some
mannere
to
know
fully
the
truth
of
this
mattere
and
what
they
were
that
rode
so
pleasantly
and
when
they
were
the
arbour
passed
by
i
me
forth
and
happ
to
meet
anon
a
right
fair
lady
i
do
you
ensure
and
she
came
riding
by
herself
alone
all
in
white
then
with
semblance
full
demure
i
her
saluted
and
bade
good
might
her
befall
as
i
could
most
humbly
and
she
answer
my
daughter
gramercy
thanks
madame
quoth
i
if
that
i
durst
enquere
of
you
i
would
fain
of
that
company
wit
what
they
be
that
pass
by
this
herbere
and
she
again
answered
right
friendly
my
faire
daughter
all
that
pass
hereby
in
white
clothing
be
servants
one
unto
the
leaf
and
i
myself
am
one
see
ye
not
her
that
crowned
is
quoth
she
clad
all
in
white
madame
then
quoth
i
yes
that
is
dian
goddess
of
chastity
and
for
because
that
she
a
maiden
is
in
her
hande
the
branch
she
beareth
this
that
agnus
castus
men
call
properly
and
all
the
ladies
in
her
company
which
ye
see
of
that
herbe
chaplets
wear
be
such
as
have
kept
alway
maidenhead
and
all
they
that
of
laurel
chaplets
bear
be
such
as
were
in
manly
deed
victorious
name
which
never
may
be
dead
and
all
they
were
so
of
their
in
in
their
time
that
no
one
might
them
withstand
and
those
that
weare
chaplets
on
their
head
of
fresh
woodbind
be
such
as
never
were
to
love
untrue
in
word
in
thought
nor
deed
but
ay
steadfast
nor
for
pleasance
nor
fear
though
that
they
should
their
heartes
all
in
would
never
flit
but
ever
were
steadfast
that
their
lives
there
asunder
brast
they
now
fair
madame
quoth
i
yet
would
i
pray
your
ladyship
if
that
it
mighte
be
that
i
might
knowe
by
some
manner
way
since
that
it
hath
liked
your
beauty
the
truth
of
these
ladies
for
to
tell
me
what
that
these
knightes
be
in
rich
armour
and
what
those
be
in
green
and
wear
the
and
why
that
some
did
to
that
tree
and
some
unto
the
plot
of
flowers
fair
with
right
good
will
my
daughter
fair
quoth
she
since
your
desire
is
good
and
debonair
courteous
the
nine
crowned
be
true
of
all
honour
longing
to
chivalry
and
those
certain
be
call
the
nine
worthy
which
ye
may
see
now
riding
all
before
that
in
their
time
did
many
a
noble
deed
and
for
their
worthiness
full
oft
have
bore
the
crown
of
laurel
leaves
upon
their
head
as
ye
may
in
your
olde
bookes
read
and
how
that
he
that
was
a
conquerour
had
by
laurel
alway
his
most
honour
and
those
that
beare
boughes
in
their
hand
of
the
precious
laurel
so
notable
be
such
as
were
i
will
ye
understand
most
noble
knightes
of
the
rounde
table
and
eke
the
douceperes
honourable
whiche
they
bear
in
sign
of
victory
as
witness
of
their
deedes
mightily
eke
there
be
knightes
old
of
the
garter
that
in
their
time
did
right
worthily
and
the
honour
they
did
to
the
is
by
it
they
have
their
laud
wholly
their
triumph
eke
and
martial
glory
which
unto
them
is
more
perfect
richess
than
any
wight
imagine
can
or
guess
for
one
leaf
given
of
that
noble
tree
to
any
wight
that
hath
done
worthily
it
be
done
so
as
it
ought
to
be
is
more
honour
than
any
thing
earthly
witness
of
rome
that
founder
was
truly
of
alle
knighthood
and
deeds
marvellous
record
i
take
of
titus
livius
and
as
for
her
that
crowned
is
in
green
it
is
flora
of
these
flowers
goddess
and
all
that
here
on
her
awaiting
it
are
such
folk
that
loved
idleness
and
not
delighted
in
no
business
but
for
to
hunt
and
hawk
and
play
in
meads
and
many
other
idle
deeds
and
for
the
great
delight
and
the
pleasance
they
have
to
the
and
so
they
unto
it
do
such
obeisance
as
ye
may
see
now
fair
madame
quoth
i
if
i
durst
ask
what
is
the
cause
and
why
that
knightes
have
the
of
honour
rather
by
the
leaf
than
by
the
soothly
daughter
quoth
she
this
is
the
troth
for
knights
should
ever
be
persevering
to
seek
honour
without
or
sloth
from
well
to
better
in
all
manner
thing
in
sign
of
which
with
leaves
aye
lasting
they
be
rewarded
after
their
degree
whose
lusty
green
may
not
be
decayed
but
ay
keeping
their
beauty
fresh
and
green
for
there
is
no
storm
that
may
them
deface
nor
hail
nor
snow
nor
wind
nor
frostes
keen
wherefore
they
have
this
property
and
grace
and
for
the
within
a
little
space
be
lost
so
simple
of
nature
they
be
that
they
no
may
endure
hardship
and
storm
will
blow
them
soon
away
nor
they
laste
not
but
for
a
season
that
is
the
cause
the
very
truth
to
say
that
they
may
not
by
no
way
of
reason
be
put
to
no
such
occupation
madame
quoth
i
with
all
my
whole
service
i
thank
you
now
in
my
most
humble
wise
for
now
i
am
ascertain
thoroughly
of
thing
that
i
desir
to
know
i
am
right
glad
that
i
have
said
soothly
aught
to
your
pleasure
if
ye
will
me
trow
quoth
she
again
but
to
whom
do
ye
owe
your
service
and
which
ye
honour
tell
me
i
pray
this
year
the
leaf
or
the
madame
quoth
i
though
i
be
least
worthy
unto
the
leaf
i
owe
mine
observance
that
is
quoth
she
right
well
done
certainly
and
i
pray
god
to
honour
you
advance
and
keep
you
from
the
wicked
remembrance
of
malebouche
and
all
his
cruelty
and
all
that
good
and
be
for
here
may
i
no
longer
now
abide
i
must
follow
the
greate
company
that
ye
may
see
yonder
before
you
ride
and
forthwith
as
i
coulde
most
humbly
i
took
my
leave
of
her
and
she
gan
after
them
as
fast
as
she
ever
might

not
it
need
hardly
be
said
into
the

in
the
modern
sense
printing
was
not
invented
for
a
century
after
this
was
written
the

thanks
partly
to
pope
brief
and
elegant
paraphrase
in
his
temple
of
fame
and
partly
to
the
familiar
force
of
the
style
and
the
satirical
significance
of
the
allegory
the
house
of
fame
is
among
the
best
known
and
relished
of
chaucer
minor
poems
the
octosyllabic
measure
in
which
it
is
written
the
same
which
the
author
of
hudibras
used
with
such
admirable
effect
is
excellently
adapted
for
the
vivid
descriptions
the
lively
sallies
of
humour
and
sarcasm
with
which
the
poem
abounds
and
when
the
poet
actually
does
get
to
his
subject
he
treats
it
with
a
zest
and
a
corresponding
interest
on
the
part
of
the
reader
which
are
scarcely
surpassed
by
the
best
of
the
canterbury
tales
the
poet
however
tarries
long
on
the
way
to
the
house
of
fame
as
pope
says
in
his
advertisement
the
reader
who
would
compare
his
with
chaucer
poem
may
begin
with
chaucer
third
book
of
fame
there
being
nothing
in
the
two
first
books
that
answers
to
their
title
the
first
book
opens
with
a
kind
of
prologue
actually
so
marked
and
called
in
earlier
editions
in
which
the
author
speculates
on
the
causes
of
dreams
avers
that
never
any
man
had
such
a
dream
as
he
had
on
the
tenth
of
december
and
prays
the
god
of
sleep
to
help
him
to
interpret
the
dream
and
the
mover
of
all
things
to
reward
or
afflict
those
readers
who
take
the
dream
well
or
then
he
relates
that
having
fallen
asleep
he
fancied
himself
within
a
temple
of
glass
the
abode
of
venus
the
walls
of
which
were
painted
with
the
story
of
aeneas
the
paintings
are
described
at
length
and
then
the
poet
tells
us
that
coming
out
of
the
temple
he
found
himself
on
a
vast
sandy
plain
and
saw
high
in
heaven
an
eagle
that
began
to
descend
towards
him
with
the
prologue
the
first
book
numbers
lines
of
which
only
more
than
are
actually
concerned
with
or
directly
lead
towards
the
real
subject
of
the
poem
are
given
here
the
second
book
containing
lines
of
which
will
be
found
in
this
edition
is
wholly
devoted
to
the
voyage
from
the
temple
of
venus
to
the
house
of
fame
which
the
dreamer
accomplishes
in
the
eagle
claws
the
bird
has
been
sent
by
jove
to
do
the
poet
some
solace
in
reward
of
his
labours
for
the
cause
of
love
and
during
the
transit
through
the
air
the
messenger
discourses
obligingly
and
learnedly
with
his
human
burden
on
the
theory
of
sound
by
which
all
that
is
spoken
must
needs
reach
the
house
of
fame
and
on
other
matters
suggested
by
their
errand
and
their
observations
by
the
way
the
third
book
of
lines
only
a
score
of
which
just
at
the
outset
have
been
omitted
brings
us
to
the
real
pith
of
the
poem
it
finds
the
poet
close
to
the
house
of
fame
built
on
a
rock
of
ice
engraved
with
names
many
of
which
are
away
entering
the
gorgeous
palace
he
finds
all
manner
of
minstrels
and
historians
harpers
pipers
and
trumpeters
of
fame
magicians
jugglers
sorcerers
and
many
others
on
a
throne
of
ruby
sits
the
goddess
seeming
at
one
moment
of
but
a
stature
at
the
next
touching
heaven
and
at
either
hand
on
pillars
stand
the
great
authors
who
bear
up
the
name
of
ancient
nations
crowds
of
people
enter
the
hall
from
all
regions
of
earth
praying
the
goddess
to
give
them
good
or
evil
fame
with
and
without
their
own
deserts
and
they
receive
answers
favourable
negative
or
contrary
according
to
the
caprice
of
fame
pursuing
his
researches
further
out
of
the
region
of
reputation
or
fame
proper
into
that
of
tidings
or
rumours
the
poet
is
led
by
a
man
who
has
entered
into
conversation
with
him
to
a
vast
whirling
house
of
twigs
ever
open
to
the
arrival
of
tidings
ever
full
of
murmurings
whisperings
and
clatterings
coming
from
the
vast
crowds
that
fill
it
for
every
rumour
every
piece
of
news
every
false
report
appears
there
in
the
shape
of
the
person
who
utters
it
or
passes
it
on
down
in
earth
out
at
the
windows
innumerable
the
tidings
pass
to
fame
who
gives
to
each
report
its
name
and
duration
and
in
the
house
travellers
pilgrims
pardoners
couriers
lovers
make
a
huge
clamour
but
here
the
poet
meets
with
a
man
of
great
authority
and
half
afraid
awakes
skilfully
whether
by
intention
fatigue
or
accident
leaving
the
reader
disappointed
by
the
nonfulfilment
of
what
seemed
to
be
promises
of
further
disclosures
the
poem
not
least
in
the
passages
the
omission
of
which
has
been
dictated
by
the
exigencies
of
the
present
volume
is
full
of
testimony
to
the
vast
acquaintance
of
chaucer
with
learning
ancient
and
modern
ovid
virgil
statius
are
equally
at
his
command
to
illustrate
his
narrative
or
to
furnish
the
of
his
descriptions
while
architecture
the
arabic
numeration
the
theory
of
sound
and
the
effects
of
gunpowder
are
only
a
few
among
the
topics
of
his
own
time
of
which
the
poet
treats
with
the
ease
of
proficient
knowledge
not
least
interesting
are
the
vivid
touches
in
which
chaucer
sketches
the
routine
of
his
laborious
and
almost
recluse
daily
life
while
the
strength
individuality
and
humour
that
mark
the
didactic
portion
of
the
poem
prove
that
the
house
of
fame
was
one
of

anon
that
dwelleth
in

upon

that
comes

to

i
that

me
speed

for

aright

and

and
from

and
send

all
that
may

that
take
it
well
and

since
that
the
world
began
befall
him
thereof
ere
he
sterve
and
grant
that
he
may
it
deserve
obtain
lo
with
such
a
conclusion
as
had
of
his
avision
croesus
that
was
the
king
of
lyde
that
high
upon
a
gibbet
died
this
prayer
shall
he
have
of
me
i
am
bet
in
charity
more
now
hearken
as
i
have
you
said
what
that
i
mette
ere
i
abraid
of
december
the
tenthe
day
when
it
was
night
to
sleep
i
lay
right
as
i
was
wont
for
to
and
fell
asleepe
wonder
soon
as
he
that
was
for
weary
from
on
pilgrimage
miles
two
to
the
leonard
of
to
make
lithe
that
erst
was
hard
but
as
i
slept
me
mette
i
was
within
a
temple
made
of
glass
in
which
there
were
more
images
of
gold
standing
in
sundry
stages
and
more
riche
tabernacles
and
with
more
pinnacles
and
more
curious
portraitures
and
of
figures
of
golde
work
than
i
saw
ever
but
certainly
i
never
where
that
it
was
but
well
wist
i
it
was
of
venus
readily
this
temple
for
in
portraiture
i
saw
anon
right
her
figure
naked
floating
in
a
sea
and
also
on
her
head
pardie
her
rose
garland
white
and
red
and
her
comb
to
comb
her
head
her
doves
and
dan
cupido
her
blinde
son
and
vulcano
that
in
his
face
was
full
brown
as
he
roamed
up
and
down
the
dreamer
saw
on
the
wall
a
tablet
of
brass
inscribed
with
the
opening
lines
of
the
aeneid
while
the
whole
story
of
aeneas
was
told
in
the
portraitures
and
gold
work
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
lines
are
devoted
to
the
description
but
they
merely
embody
virgil
account
of
aeneas
adventures
from
the
destruction
of
troy
to
his
arrival
in
italy
and
the
only
characteristic
passage
is
the
following
reflection
suggested
by
the
death
of
dido
for
her
perfidious
but
guest
lo
how
a
woman
doth
amiss
to
love
him
that
unknowen
is
for
by
christ
lo
thus
it
fareth
it
is
not
all
gold
that
glareth
for
all
so
brook
i
well
my
head
there
may
be
under
appearance
cover
many
a
vice
therefore
let
no
wight
be
so
to
take
a
love
only
for
cheer
or
speech
or
for
friendly
mannere
for
this
shall
woman
find
that
some
man
his
pure
kind
force
of
his
nature
will
showen
outward
the
fairest
till
he
have
caught
that
which
him
lest
and
then
anon
will
causes
find
and
sweare
how
she
is
unkind
or
false
or
double
was
all
this
say
i
aeneas
reference
to
and
dido
and
her
lest
that
loved
all
too
soon
a
guest
therefore
i
will
say
a
proverb
that
he
that
fully
knows
the
herb
may
safely
lay
it
to
his
eye
withoute
dread
this
is
no
lie
when
the
dreamer
had
seen
all
the
sights
in
the
temple
he
became
desirous
to
know
who
had
worked
all
those
wonders
and
in
what
country
he
was
so
he
resolved
to
go
out
at
the
wicket
in
search
of
somebody
who
might
tell
him
when
i
out
at
the
doores
came
i
fast
aboute
me
beheld
then
saw
i
but
a
large
feld
country
as
far
as
that
i
mighte
see
withoute
town
or
house
or
tree
or
bush
or
grass
or
land
for
all
the
field
was
but
of
sand
as
as
men
may
see
it
lie
in
the
desert
of
libye
nor
no
manner
creature
that
is
formed
by
nature
there
saw
i
me
to
or
wiss
or
o
christ
thought
i
that
art
in
bliss
from
and
fancy
and
me
save
and
with
devotion
mine
eyen
to
the
i
cast
then
was
i
ware
at
the
last
that
faste
by
the
sun
on
high
kennen
might
with
mine
eye
well
as
i
might
me
thought
i
saw
an
eagle
soar
but
that
it
seemed
muche
than
i
had
any
eagle
seen
this
is
as
sooth
as
death
certain
it
was
of
gold
and
shone
so
bright
that
never
saw
men
such
a
sight
but
the
heaven
had
all
new
from
god
another
sun
so
shone
the
eagle
feathers
bright
and
somewhat
downward
gan
it
light
alight
the
second
book
opens
with
a
brief
invocation
of
venus
and
of
thought
then
it
proceeds
this
eagle
of
which
i
have
you
told
that
shone
with
feathers
as
of
gold
which
that
so
high
began
to
soar
i
gan
beholde
more
and
more
to
see
her
beauty
and
the
wonder
but
never
was
there
dint
of
thunder
nor
that
thing
that
men
calle
foudre
that
smote
sometimes
a
town
to
powder
and
in
his
swifte
coming
brenn
that
so
gan
descend
as
this
fowl
when
that
it
beheld
that
i
was
in
the
feld
and
with
his
grim
pawes
strong
within
his
sharpe
nailes
long
me
flying
at
a
he
hent
and
with
his
sours
again
up
went
me
carrying
in
his
clawes
as
light
as
i
had
been
a
lark
how
high
i
can
not
telle
you
for
i
came
up
i
wist
not
how
the
poet
faints
through
bewilderment
and
fear
but
the
eagle
speaking
with
the
voice
of
a
man
recalls
him
to
himself
and
comforts
him
by
the
assurance
that
what
now
befalls
him
is
for
his
instruction
and
profit
answering
the
poet
unspoken
inquiry
whether
he
is
not
to
die
otherwise
or
whether
jove
will
him
stellify
the
eagle
says
that
he
has
been
sent
by
jupiter
out
of
his
great
ruth
for
that
thou
hast
so
truely
so
long
served
attentive
zeal
his
blinde
cupido
and
faire
venus
also
withoute
guuerdon
ever
yet
and
natheless
hast
set
thy
wit
although
that
in
thy
head
full
is
to
make
bookes
songs
and
ditties
in
rhyme
or
elles
in
cadence
as
thou
best
canst
in
reverence
of
love
and
of
his
servants
eke
that
have
his
service
sought
and
seek
and
pained
thee
to
praise
his
art
although
thou
haddest
never
part
wherefore
all
so
god
me
bless
jovis
holds
it
great
humbless
and
virtue
eke
that
thou
wilt
make
full
oft
thy
head
to
ache
in
thy
study
so
thou
writest
and
evermore
of
love
enditest
in
honour
of
him
and
praisings
and
in
his
folke
furtherings
and
in
their
matter
all
devisest
and
not
him
nor
his
folk
despisest
although
thou
go
in
the
dance
of
them
that
him
list
not
advance
wherefore
as
i
said
now
jupiter
well
considers
this
and
also
beausire
other
things
sir
that
is
that
thou
hast
no
tidings
of
love
folk
if
they
be
glad
nor
of
naught
elles
that
god
made
and
not
only
from
far
country
that
no
tidings
come
to
thee
but
of
thy
very
neighebours
that
dwellen
almost
at
thy
doors
thou
hearest
neither
that
nor
this
for
when
thy
labour
all
done
is
and
hast
thy
reckonings
instead
of
rest
and
newe
things
thou
home
to
thy
house
anon
and
all
so
dumb
as
any
stone
thou
sittest
at
another
book
till
fully
is
thy
look
and
livest
thus
as
a
hermite
although
thine
abstinence
is
lite
therefore
has
jove
appointed
the
eagle
to
take
the
poet
to
the
house
of
fame
to
do
him
some
pleasure
in
recompense
for
his
devotion
to
cupid
and
he
will
hear
says
the
bird
when
we
be
come
there
as
i
say
more
wondrous
thinges
dare
i
lay
of
love
folke
more
tidings
both
sawes
and
leasings
sayings
and
and
more
loves
new
begun
and
long
loves
won
and
more
loves
casually
that
be
betid
no
man
knows
why
by
chance
but
as
a
blind
man
starts
a
hare
and
more
jollity
and
welfare
while
that
they
finde
of
steel
true
as
as
thinketh
them
and
over
all
weel
more
discords
and
more
jealousies
more
murmurs
and
more
novelties
and
more
dissimulations
and
feigned
reparations
and
more
beardes
in
two
hours
withoute
razor
or
scissours
than
graines
be
of
sands
and
eke
more
holding
in
hands
and
also
more
of
old
acquaintances
more
and
more
accords
than
on
instruments
be
chords
and
eke
of
love
more
exchanges
than
ever
cornes
were
in
granges
the
poet
can
scarcely
believe
that
though
fame
had
all
the
pies
magpies
and
all
the
spies
in
a
kingdom
she
should
hear
so
much
but
the
eagle
proceeds
to
prove
that
she
can
first
shalt
thou
heare
where
she
dwelleth
and
so
as
thine
own
booke
telleth
her
palace
stands
as
i
shall
say
right
in
middes
of
the
way
betweene
and
earth
and
sea
that
in
all
these
three
is
spoken
or
apert
or
the
air
thereto
is
so
overt
and
stands
eke
in
so
a
place
that
sound
must
to
it
pace
or
whatso
comes
from
any
tongue
be
it
rowned
read
or
sung
or
spoken
in
surety
or
dread
certain
must
thither
need
must
needs
go
the
eagle
in
a
long
discourse
demonstrates
that
as
all
natural
things
have
a
natural
place
towards
which
they
move
by
natural
inclination
and
as
sound
is
only
broken
air
so
every
sound
must
come
to
fame
house
though
it
were
piped
of
a
mouse
on
the
same
principle
by
which
every
part
of
a
mass
of
water
is
affected
by
the
casting
in
of
a
stone
the
poet
is
all
the
while
borne
upward
entertained
with
various
information
by
the
bird
which
at
last
cries
out
hold
up
thy
head
for
all
is
well
saint
julian
lo
bon
hostel
see
here
the
house
of
fame
lo
thou
not
heare
that
i
do
what
quoth
i
the
greate
soun
quoth
he
that
rumbleth
up
and
down
in
fame
house
full
of
tidings
both
of
fair
speech
and
of
chidings
and
of
false
and
sooth
compouned
mingled
hearken
well
it
is
not
rowned
hearest
thou
not
the
greate
swough
sound
yes
pardie
quoth
i
well
enough
and
what
sound
is
it
like
quoth
he
peter
the
beating
of
the
sea
quoth
i
against
the
rockes
hollow
when
tempests
do
the
shippes
swallow
and
let
a
man
stand
out
of
doubt
a
mile
thence
and
hear
it
rout
or
elles
like
the
last
low
distant
noise
after
the
clap
of
a
when
jovis
hath
the
air
but
it
doth
me
for
feare
sweat
nay
dread
thee
not
thereof
quoth
he
it
is
nothing
will
bite
thee
thou
shalt
no
harme
have
truly
and
with
that
word
both
he
and
i
as
nigh
the
place
arrived
were
as
men
might
caste
with
a
spear
i
wist
not
how
but
in
a
street
he
set
me
fair
upon
my
feet
and
saide
walke
forth
apace
and
take
adventure
or
case
chance
of
what
that
thou
shalt
find
in
fame
place
may
now
quoth
i
while
we
have
space
to
speak
ere
that
i
go
from
thee
for
the
love
of
god
as
telle
me
in
sooth
that
i
will
of
thee
lear
if
this
noise
that
i
hear
be
as
i
have
heard
thee
tell
of
folk
that
down
in
earthe
dwell
and
cometh
here
in
the
same
wise
as
i
thee
heard
ere
this
devise
and
that
there
living
body
not
in
all
that
house
that
yonder
is
that
maketh
all
this
loude
fare
ado
no
answered
he
by
saint
clare
and
all
wisly
god
rede
me
surely
god
but
one
thing
i
will
warne
thee
guide
of
the
which
thou
wilt
have
wonder
lo
to
the
house
of
fame
yonder
thou
how
cometh
speech
it
needeth
not
thee
to
teach
but
understand
now
right
well
this
when
any
speech
is
up
to
the
palace
anon
right
it
like
the
same
which
that
the
word
in
earthe
spake
be
he
cloth
in
red
or
black
and
so
weareth
his
likeness
and
speaks
the
word
that
thou
wilt
that
it
the
same
body
be
whether
man
or
woman
he
or
she
and
is
not
this
a
wondrous
thing
yes
quoth
i
then
by
heaven
king
and
with
this
word
farewell
quoth
he
and
here
i
will
thee
for
and
god
of
heaven
send
thee
grace
some
good
to
in
this
place
and
i
of
him
took
leave
anon
and
gan
forth
to
the
palace
at
the
opening
of
the
third
book
chaucer
briefly
invokes
apollo
guidance
and
entreats
him
because
the
rhyme
is
light
and
lewd
to
make
it
somewhat
agreeable
though
some
verse
fail
in
a
syllable
if
the
god
answers
the
prayer
the
poet
promises
to
kiss
the
next
he
sees
and
he
proceeds
when
i
was
from
this
eagle
gone
i
gan
behold
upon
this
place
and
certain
ere
i
farther
pace
i
will
you
all
the
shape
of
house
and
city
and
all
the
wise
how
i
gan
to
this
place
approach
that
stood
upon
so
high
a
roche
higher
standeth
none
in
spain
but
up
i
climb
with
muche
pain
and
though
to
climbe
me
me
painful
yet
i
was
to
see
and
for
to
wondrous
low
closely
if
i
could
any
wise
know
what
manner
stone
this
rocke
was
for
it
was
like
a
thing
of
glass
but
that
it
shone
full
more
clear
but
of
what
congealed
mattere
it
was
i
wist
not
readily
but
at
the
last
espied
i
and
found
that
it
was
a
rock
of
ice
and
not
of
steel
thought
i
by
saint
thomas
of
kent
this
were
a
feeble
a
place
so
high
which
to
build
he
ought
him
to
glorify
that
hereon
built
god
so
me
save
then
saw
i
all
the
half
with
famous
folke
names
fele
that
hadde
been
in
muche
weal
fortune
and
their
fames
wide
but
well
might
i
know
any
letters
for
to
read
their
names
by
for
out
of
they
were
almost
off
thawed
so
that
of
the
letters
one
or
two
were
away
of
name
so
unfamous
was
their
fame
but
men
say
what
may
ever
last
then
gan
i
in
my
heart
to
that
they
were
molt
away
for
heat
and
not
away
with
stormes
beat
for
on
the
other
side
i
of
this
hill
that
northward
lay
how
it
was
written
full
of
names
of
folke
that
had
greate
fames
of
olde
times
and
yet
they
were
as
fresh
as
men
had
writ
them
there
the
selfe
day
right
ere
that
hour
that
i
upon
them
gan
to
pore
but
well
i
wiste
what
it
made
it
was
conserved
with
the
shade
all
the
writing
which
i
sigh
of
a
castle
that
stood
on
high
and
stood
eke
on
so
cold
a
place
that
heat
might
it
not
deface
destroy
then
gan
i
on
this
hill
to
and
found
upon
the
a
won
that
all
the
men
that
be
alive
have
not
the
to
to
the
beauty
of
that
like
place
nor
coulde
no
no
such
another
for
to
make
that
might
of
beauty
be
its
make
equal
nor
one
so
wondrously
that
it
astonieth
yet
my
thought
and
maketh
all
my
wit
to
swink
upon
this
castle
for
to
think
so
that
the
greate
beauty
cast
craft
and
curiosity
ne
can
i
not
to
you
devise
my
witte
may
me
not
suffice
but
natheless
all
the

thus
heard
i
cryen
all
and
fast
they
came
out
of
the
hall
and
shooke
and
sterlings
and
some
were
as
kings
with
crownes
wrought
fall
of
lozenges
and
many
ribands
and
many
fringes
were
on
their
clothes
truely
then

throwen
a
vesture
which
that

call
a
embroidered
wondrously
rich
as
though

were
like
but
naught
will
i
so
may
i
thrive
aboute
to
myself
with
all
these
armes
that
there
were
that
they
thus
on
their
coates
bare
for
it
to
me
were
impossible
men
might
make
of
them
a
bible
twenty
foote
thick
i
trow
for
certain
whoso
coulde
know
might
there
all
the
armes
of
famous
folk
that
have
been
in
afric
europe
and
asie
since
first
began
the
chivalry
lo
how
should
i
now
tell
all
this
nor
of
the
hall
eke
what
need
is
to
telle
you
that
wall
of
it
and
floor
and
roof
and
all
was
plated
half
a
foote
thick
of
gold
and
that
was
nothing
wick
but
for
to
prove
in
alle
wise
as
fine
as
ducat
of
venise
of
which
too
little
in
my
pouch
is
and
they
were
set
as
thick
of
fine
of
the
finest
stones
fair
that
men
read
in
the
lapidaire
as
grasses
growen
in
a
mead
but
it
were
all
too
long
to
the
names
and
therefore
i
pass
but
in
this
rich
and
lusty
place
that
fame
hall
was
full
muche
press
of
folk
there
not
nor
crowding
for
too
muche
press
but
all
on
high
above
a
dais
set
on
a
imperial
that
made
was
of
ruby
all
which
that
carbuncle
is
i
saw
perpetually
a
feminine
creature
that
never
formed
by
nature
was
such
another
thing
for
altherfirst
sooth
to
say
of
all
me
thoughte
that
she
was
so
lite
that
the
length
of
a
cubite
was
longer
than
she
seem
to
be
but
thus
soon
in
a
while
she
herself
then
wonderfully
stretch
that
with
her
feet
the
earth
she
reach
and
with
her
head
she
touched
heaven
where
as
shine
the
starres
seven
and
eke
as
to
my
wit
i
saw
a
greater
wonder
yet
upon
her
eyen
to
behold
but
certes
i
them
never
told
for
fele
hadde
she
many
as
feathers

on
the
beastes
four

crips
and
as
burnish
gold
it
shone
to
see
and
sooth
to

had
all
so
upstanding
ears
and
tongues
as
on

be
hairs
and
on
her
feet
waxen
saw
i
partridges

saw
sitting
on
this

and
the
heavenly
melody
of

full
of

i
heard
about
her
throne
that
all
the
palace
walles
rung
so
sung
the
mighty
muse
she
that

calliope
and
her

and
evermore
eternally

a
pillere
of
metal
that

but
though
they
were
of
no
richess
yet
were
they
made
for
great
nobless
and
in
them
greate
sentence
and
folk
of

lofty
of
which

stooden
other

full
wise

worthy
for
to
neven
to
help
him
bearen
up
the
charge
it
was
so
heavy
and
so
large
and
for
they
writen
of
battailes
as
well
as
other
old
marvailes
therefore
was
lo
this
pillere
of
which
that
i
you

here
of
lead
and
iron
both
for
iron
marte
metal
is
which
that
god
is

then
stoode
forth
on

of
them
which
i
coulde

though
i
them
not
by
order
tell
to
make
you
too
longe
dwell
these
of
the
which
i
gin
you
read
there
saw
i
standen
out
of
dread
upon
an
iron
pillar
strong
that
painted
was

with
tiger
blood
in
place
the

joy
was
busy
for
to
bear
up
troy
so
heavy
thereof
was
the
fame
that
for
to
bear
it
was
no
game
but
yet
i
gan
full
well
espy
betwixt
them
was
a
little
envy
one
said
that
homer
made
lies
feigning
in
his
poetries
and
was
to
the
greeks
favourable
therefore
held
he
it
but
a
fable
then
saw
i
stand
on
a

of
tinned
iron
clear

the
latin

there
he
bare
up
well
his
name
upon
this
pillar
all
so
high
as
i
might
see
it
with
mine
eye
for
why
this
hall
whereof
i
read
was
waxen
in
height
and
length
and
bread
well
more
by
a
thousand
than
it
was
erst
that
saw
i
weel
then
saw
i
on
a
pillar
by
of
iron
wrought
full
sternely
the
greate
poet
dan
lucan
that
on
his
shoulders
bare
up
than
as
high
as
that
i
might
it
see
the
fame
of
julius
and
pompey
and
by
him
stood
all
those
clerks
that
write
of
rome
mighty
works
that
if
i
would
their
names
tell
all
too
longe
must
i
dwell
and
next
him
on
a
pillar
stood
of
sulphur
like
as

alle
fulle
of

a
full
confus
mattere
were
all
these
gestes
for
to
hear
that
they
of
write
and
how
they
hight
called
but
while

a
noise
approache
blive
that
as

do
in
a
hive
against
their
time
of
outflying
right
such
a
manner
murmuring
for
all

it
seem
to
me

a
right
great
company
withal
and

easily
to

and
by

there
is
none

nor
ever

is
in
that
place
that
it

full
of
tidings
not
either

or
of

and
ever
all
the

angles
are
full
of
and
of
jangles
and
of
wars
of
peace
of
marriages
of

and
lo
this
house
of
which
i
write
be
ye
it
was
not
lite
for
it
was
sixty
mile
of
length
was
the
timber
of
no
strength
yet
it
is
founded
to
endure
that
it
list
to
adventure
fortune
that
is
the
mother
of
tidings
as
is
the
sea
of
wells
and
springs
and
it
was
shapen
like
a
cage
certes
quoth
i
in
all
mine
age
saw
i
such
a
house
as
this
and
as
i
wonder
me
upon
this
house
then
ware
was
i
how
that
mine
eagle
faste
by
was
perched
high
upon
a
stone
and
i
gan
straighte
to
him
and
saide
thus
i
praye
thee
that
thou
a
while
me
for
for
godde
love
and
let
me
see
what
wonders
in
this
place
be
for
yet
i
may
some
good
thereon
or
somewhat
hear
that
me
were
ere
that
i
went
pleasing
to
peter
that
is
mine
intent
quoth
he
to
me
therefore
i
dwell
but
certain
one
thing
i
thee
tell
that
i
bringe
thee
therein
thou
shalt
never
to
come
into
it
out
of
doubt
so
fast
it
whirleth
lo
about
but
since
that
jovis
of
his
grace
as
i
have
said
will
thee
solace
finally
with
these
things
these
uncouth
sightes
and
tidings
to
pass
away
thy
heaviness
such
hath
he
of
thy
distress
that
thou
debonairly
and
thyselven
utterly
desperate
of
alle
bliss
since
that
fortune
hath
made
amiss
the
fruit
of
all
thy
hearte
rest
languish
and
eke
point
to
brest
the
point
of
but
he
through
his
mighty
merite
will
do
thee
ease
all
be
it
lite
and
gave
express
commandement
to
which
i
am
obedient
to
further
thee
with
all
my
might
and
and
teache
thee
aright
where
thou
moste
tidings
hear
shalt
thou
anon
many
one
lear
and
with
this
word
he
right
anon
me
up
betwixt
his
tone
and
at
a
window
in
me
brought
that
in
this
house
was
as
me
thought
and
therewithal
me
thought
it
stent
and
nothing
it
aboute
went
and
set
me
in
the
floore
down
but
such
a
congregatioun
of
folk
as
i
saw
roam
about
some
within
and
some
without
was
never
seen
nor
shall
be
eft
hereafter
that
certes
in
the
world
n
left
not
so
many
formed
by
nature
nor
dead
so
many
a
creature
that
well
in
that
place
had
i
a
foote
breadth
of
space
and
wight
that
i
saw
there
evereach
in
other
ear
a
newe
tiding
privily
or
elles
told
all
openly
right
thus
and
saide
not
thou
what
is
betid
lo
righte
now
no
quoth
he
telle
me
what
and
then
he
told
him
this
and
that
and
swore
thereto
that
it
was
sooth
thus
hath
he
said
and
thus
he
and
thus
shall
be
and
thus
heard
i
say
that
shall
be
found
that
dare
i
lay
that
all
the
folk
that
is
alive
have
not
the
cunning
to
the
thinges
that
i
hearde
there
what
aloud
and
what
in
but
all
the
wonder
most
was
this
when
one
had
heard
a
thing
he
came
straight
to
another
wight
and
gan
him
tellen
anon
right
the
same
tale
that
to
him
was
told
or
it
a
furlong
way
was
old
and
gan
somewhat
for
to
add
to
this
tiding
in
his
speech
more
than
it
ever
spoken
was
and
not
so
soon
departed
he
from
him
than
that
he
met
with
the
third
and
he
let
any
stound
he
told
him
als
delaying
a
were
the
tidings
true
or
false
yet
would
he
tell
it
natheless
and
evermore
with
more
increase
than
it
was
erst
thus
north
and
south
first
went
tiding
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
that
increasing
evermo
as
fire
is
wont
to
and
alive
and
from
a
spark
amiss
till
all
a
city
burnt
up
is
and
when
that
it
was
full
and
more
on
tongue
than
it
was
it
went
anon
up
to
a
window
out
to
or
but
it
mighte
thereout
pass
it
gan
creep
out
at
some
crevass
chink
and
fly
forth
faste
for
the
nonce
and
sometimes
saw
i
there
at
once
leasing
and
a
sad
sooth
saw
falsehood
and
an
earnest
that
gan
draw
true
chance
out
at
a
window
for
to
pace
and
when
they
metten
in
that
place
they
were
checked
both
the
two
and
neither
of
them
might
out
go
for
other
so
they
gan
crowd
squeeze
each
till
each
of
them
gan
cryen
loud
let
me
go
first
nay
but
let
me
and
here
i
will
ensure
thee
with
vowes
if
thou
wilt
do
so
that
i
shall
never
from
thee
go
but
be
thine
owen
sworen
brother
we
will
us
each
with
other
that
no
man
be
he
so
wroth
shall
have
one
of
us
two
but
both
at
ones
as
his
leave
his
come
we
at
morning
or
at
eve
be
we
cried
or
thus
saw
i
false
and
sooth
compouned
together
fly
for
one
tiding
then
out
at
holes
gan
to
struggle
every
tiding
straight
to
fame
and
she
gan
give
to
each
his
name
after
her
disposition
and
gave
them
eke
duration
some
to
wax
and
wane
soon
as
doth
the
faire
white
moon
and
let
them
go
there
might
i
see
winged
wonders
full
fast
flee
twenty
thousand
in
a
rout
as
aeolus
them
blew
about
and
lord
this
house
in
alle
times
was
full
of
shipmen
and
pilgrimes
with
bretfull
of
leasings
brimful
of
entremedled
with
stories
and
eke
alone
by
themselve
and
many
thousand
times
twelve
saw
i
eke
of
these
pardoners
couriers
and
eke
messengers
with
crammed
full
of
lies
as
ever
vessel
was
with
lyes
of
wine
and
as
i
went
all
speed
about
and
did
all
mine
intent
me
to
play
and
for
to
lear
amuse
and
instruct
and
eke
a
tiding
for
to
hear
that
i
had
heard
of
some
country
that
shall
not
now
be
told
for
me
for
it
no
need
is
readily
folk
can
sing
it
better
than
i
for
all
must
out
or
late
or
rath
all
the
sheaves
in
the
lath
i
heard
a
greate
noise
withal
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
where
men
of
love
tidings
told
and
i
gan
thitherward
behold
for
i
saw
running
wight
as
fast
as
that
they
hadde
might
and
cried
what
thing
is
that
and
some
said
i
know
never
what
and
when

to

the
poet
briefly
refers
to
the
description
of
the
house
of
somnus
in

metamorphoses
xi

where
the
cave
of

issues
from
the
base
of

see
the
account
of
the
vision
of
croesus
in
the
monk
tale
the
meaning
of
the
allusion
is
not
clear
but
the
story
of
the
pilgrims
and
the
peas
is
perhaps
suggested
by
the
line
following
to
make
lithe
soft
what
erst
was
hard
st
leonard
was
the
patron
of
captives
corsaint
the
corpus
sanctum
the
holy
body
or
relics
preserved
in
the
shrine
so
in
the
temple
of

described
in
the
knight
tale
the
goddess
is
represented
as

he

when
he
descended
on
the
prey
and
took
it
in
flight
this
is
only
one
among
many
instances
in
which
chaucer
disclaims
the
pursuits
of
love
and
the
description
of
his
manner
of
life
which
follows
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
disclaimer
was
no
mere
affectation
of
a
gallant
this
reference
approximately
fixing
the
date
at
which
the
poem
was
composed
points
clearly
to
chaucer
daily
work
as
comptroller
of
the
customs
a
post
which
he
held
from
to
this
is
a
frank
enough
admission
that
the
poet
was
fond
of
good
cheer
and
the
effect
of
his
little
abstinence
on
his
corporeal
appearance
is
humorously
described
in
the
prologue
to
the
tale
of
sir
thopas
where
the
host
compliments
chaucer
on
being
as
well
shapen
in
the
waist
as
himself
to
make
the
beard
means
to
befool
or
deceive
see
note
to
the
reeve
tale
precisely
the
same
idea
is
conveyed
in
the
modern
slang
word
shave
meaning
a
trick
or
fraud
see
note
to
the
prologue
to
the
canterbury
tales
if
this
reference
is
to
any
book
of
chaucer
in
which
the
house
of
fame
was
mentioned
the
book
has
not
come
down
to
us
it
has
been
reasonably
supposed
however
that
chaucer
means
by
his
own
book
ovid
metamorphoses
of
which
he
was
evidently
very
fond
and
in
the
twelfth
book
of
that
poem
the
temple
of
fame
is
described
saint
julian
was
the
patron
of
hospitality
so
the
franklin
in
the
prologue
to

is
said
to
be

the

of

it
may
have
been
employed
as
an
appellative
of

derived
from

on

he
played

it
is
not

to
suggest

therefore

by

might
naturally
be
said
by

be
of
athens

the
phrygian
who
having
found
the

pleased

was
beaten

and
beauty
of
the
poem
as
a
work
of
art
are
not
more
conspicuous
than
the
knowledge
of
human
nature
displayed
in
the
portraits
of
the
principal
characters
the
result
is
that
the
poem
is
more
modern
in
form
and
in
spirit
than
almost
any
other
work
of
its
author
the
chaste
style
and
sedulous
polish
of
the
stanzas
admit
of
easy
change
into
the
forms
of
speech
now
current
in
england
while
the
analytical
and
subjective
character
of
the
work
gives
it
for
the
nineteenth
century
reader
an
interest
of
the
same
kind
as
that
inspired
say
by
george
eliot
wonderful
study
of
character
in
romola
then
above
all
troilus
and
cressida
is
distinguished
by
a
purity
and
elevation
of
moral
tone
that
may
surprise
those
who
judge
of
chaucer
only
by
the
coarse
traits
of
his
time
preserved
in
the
canterbury
tales
or
who
may
expect
to
find
here
the
troilus
the
cressida
and
the
pandarus
of
shakspeare
play
it
is
to
no
trivial
gallant
no
woman
of
coarse
mind
and
easy
virtue
no
malignantly
subservient
and
utterly
debased
procurer
that
chaucer
introduces
us
his
troilus
is
a
noble
sensitive
generous
souled
manly
magnanimous
hero
who
is
only
confirmed
and
stimulated
in
all
virtue
by
his
love
who
lives
for
his
lady
and
dies
for
her
falsehood
in
a
lofty
and
chivalrous
fashion
his
cressida
is
a
stately
virtuous
woman
who
loves
with
all
the
pure
strength
and
trustful
abandonment
of
a
generous
and
exalted
nature
and
who
is
driven
to
infidelity
perhaps
even
less
by
pressure
of
circumstances
than
by
the
sheer
force
of
her
love
which
will
go
on
loving
loving
what
it
can
have
when
that
which
it
would
rather
have
is
for
the
time
unattainable
his
pandarus
is
a
gentleman
though
a
gentleman
with
a
flaw
in
him
a
man
who
in
his
places
the
claims
of
comradeship
above
those
of
honour
and
plots
away
the
virtue
of
his
niece
that
he
may
appease
the
of
his
friend
all
the
time
conscious
that
he
is
not
acting
as
a
gentleman
should
and
desirous
that
others
should
give
him
that
justification
which
he
can
get
but
feebly
and
diffidently
in
himself
in
fact
the
troilus
and
cressida
of
chaucer
is
the
troilus
and
cressida
of
shakespeare
transfigured
the
atmosphere
the
colour
the
spirit
are
wholly
different
the
older
poet
presents
us
in
the
chief
characters
to
noble
natures
the
younger
to
ignoble
natures
in
all
the
characters
and
the
poem
with
which
we
have
now
to
do
stands
at
this
day
among
the
noblest
expositions
of
love
workings
in
the
human
heart
and
life
it
is
divided
into
five
books
containing
altogether
lines
the
first
book
lines
tells
how
calchas
priest
of
apollo
quitting
beleaguered
troy
left
there
his
only
daughter
cressida
how
troilus
the
youngest
brother
of
hector
and
son
of
king
priam
fell
in
love
with
her
at
first
sight
at
a
festival
in
the
temple
of
pallas
and
sorrowed
bitterly
for
her
love
and
how
his
friend
cressida
uncle
pandarus
comforted
him
by
the
promise
of
aid
in
his
suit
the
second
book
lines
relates
the
subtle
manoeuvres
of
pandarus
to
induce
cressida
to
return
the
love
of
troilus
which
he
accomplishes
mainly
by
touching
at
once
the
lady
admiration
for
his
heroism
and
her
pity
for
his
on
her
account
the
third
book
lines
opens
with
an
account
of
the
first
interview
between
the
lovers
ere
it
closes
the
skilful
stratagems
of
pandarus
have
placed
the
pair
in
each
other
arms
under
his
roof
and
the
lovers
are
happy
in
perfect
enjoyment
of
each
other
love
and
trust
in
the
fourth
book
lines
the
course
of
true
love
ceases
to
run
smooth
cressida
is
compelled
to
quit
the
city
in
ransom
for
antenor
captured
in
a
skirmish
and
she
sadly
departs
to
the
camp
of
the
greeks
vowing
that
she
will
make
her
escape
and
return
to
troy
and
troilus
within
ten
days
the
fifth
book
lines
sets
out
by
describing
the
court
which
diomedes
appointed
to
escort
her
pays
to
cressida
on
the
way
to
the
camp
it
traces
her
gradual
progress
from
indifference
to
her
new
suitor
to
incontinence
with
him
and
it
leaves
the
deserted
troilus
dead
on
the
field
of
battle
where
he
has
sought
an
eternal
refuge
from
the
new
grief
provoked
by
clear
proof
of
his
mistress
infidelity
the
polish
elegance
and
power
of
the
style
and
the
acuteness
of
insight
into
character
which
mark
the
poem
seem
to
claim
for
it
a
date
considerably
later
than
that
adopted
by
those
who
assign
its
composition
to
youth
and
the
literary
allusions
and
proverbial
expressions
with
which
it
abounds
give
ample
evidence
that
if
chaucer
really
wrote
it
at
an
early
age
his
youth
must
have
been
precocious
beyond
all
actual
record
throughout
the
poem
there
are
repeated
references
to
the
old
authors
of
trojan
histories
who
are
named
in
the
house
of
fame
but
chaucer
especially
mentions
one
lollius
as
the
author
from
whom
he
takes
the
groundwork
of
the
poem
lydgate
is
responsible
for
the
assertion
that
lollius
meant
boccaccio
and
though
there
is
no
authority
for
supposing
that
the
english
really
meant
to
designate
the
italian
poet
under
that
name
there
is
abundant
internal
proof
that
the
poem
was
really
founded
on
the
filostrato
of
boccaccio
but
the
tone
of
chaucer
work
is
much
higher
than
that
of
his
italian
auctour
and
while
in
some
passages
the
imitation
is
very
close
in
all
that
is
characteristic
in
troilus
and
cressida
chaucer
has
fairly
thrust
his
models
out
of
sight
in
the
present
edition
it
has
been
possible
to
give
no
more
than
about
of
the
poem
out
of
the
stanzas
that
compose
it
but
pains
have
been
taken
to
convey
in
the
connecting
prose
passages
a
faithful
idea
of
what
is
perforce
omitted
the
first
book
the
double
sorrow
of
troilus
to
tell
that
was
the
king
priamus
son
of
troy
in
loving
how
his
fell
from
woe
to
weal
and
out
of
joy
my
purpose
is
ere

compassion
as
though
i
were
their
owen
brother
dear
now
listen
all
with
good
entention
for
i
will
now
go
straight
to
my
mattere
in
which
ye
shall
the
double
sorrow
hear
of
troilus
in
loving
of
cresside
and
how
that
she
forsook
him
ere
she
died
in
troy
during
the
siege
dwelt
a
lord
of
great
authority
a
great
divine
named
calchas
who
through
the
oracle
of
apollo
knew
that
troy
should
be
destroyed
he
stole
away
secretly
to
the
greek
camp
where
he
was
gladly
received
and
honoured
for
his
skill
in
divining
of
which
the
besiegers
hoped
to
make
use
within
the
city
there
was
great
anger
at
the
treason
of
calchas
and
the
people
declared
that
he
and
all
his
kin
were
worthy
to
be
burnt
his
daughter
whom
he
had
left
in
the
city
a
widow
and
alone
was
in
great
fear
for
her
life
cressida
was
this
lady
name
aright
to
my
doom
in
alle
troy
city
my
so
fair
was
none
for
over
wight
so
angelic
was
her
native
beauty
that
like
a
thing
immortal
seemed
she
as
sooth
a
perfect
creature
that
down
seem
sent
in
scorning
of
nature
in
her
distress
well
nigh
out
of
her
wit
for
pure
fear
she
appealed
for
protection
to
hector
who
piteous
of
nature
and
touched
by
her
sorrow
and
her
beauty
assured
her
of
safety
so
long
as
she
pleased
to
dwell
in
troy
the
siege
went
on
but
they
of
troy
did
not
neglect
the
honour
and
worship
of
their
deities
most
of
all
of
the
relic
hight
palladion
that
was
their
trust
aboven
one
in
april
when
clothed
is
the
mead
with
newe
green
of
jolly
ver
spring
the
prime
the
trojans
went
to
hold
the
festival
of
palladion
crowding
to
the
temple
in
all
their
beste
guise
lusty
knights
fresh
ladies
and
maidens
bright
among
the
which
was
this
cresseida
in
widow
habit
black
but
natheless
right
as
our
firste
letter
is
now
a
in
beauty
first
so
stood
she
makeless
her
goodly
looking
gladded
all
the
press
was
never
seen
thing
to
be
praised
derre
more
worthy
nor
under
blacke
cloud
so
bright
a
sterre
as
she
was
as
they
saiden
one
that
her
behelden
in
her
blacke
weed
and
yet
she
stood
full
low
and
still
alone
behind
all
other
folk
little
brede
and
nigh
the
door
ay
shame
drede
dread
of
simple
of
bearing
of
cheer
with
a
full
looking
and
mannere
dan
troilus
as
he
was
wont
to
guide
his
younge
knightes
led
them
up
and
down
in
that
large
temple
upon
side
beholding
ay
the
ladies
of
the
town
now
here
now
there
for
no
devotioun
had
he
to
none
to
his
rest

but
gan
to
and
lacke
whom
him
lest
and
disparage
whom
he
and
in
his
walk
full
fast
he
gan
to
observe
if
knight
or
squier
of
his
company
gan
for
to
sigh
or
let
his
eyen
on
any
woman
that
he
could
espy
then
he
would
smile
and
hold
it
a
folly
and
say
him
thus
ah
lord
she
sleepeth
soft
for
love
of
thee
when
as
thou
turnest
oft
i
have
heard
told
pardie
of
your
living
ye
lovers
and
your
observance
foolish
and
what
a
labour
folk
have
in
winning
of
love
and
in
it
keeping
with
doubtance
and
when
your
prey
is
lost
woe
and
penance
oh
very
fooles
may
ye
no
thing
see
can
none
of
you
aware
by
other
be
but
the
god
of
love
vowed
vengeance
on
troilus
for
that
despite
and
showing
that
his
bow
was
not
broken
hit
him
at
the
full
within
the
temple
went
he
forth
playing
this
troilus
with
wight
about
on
this
lady
and
now
on
that
looking
whether
she
were
of
town
or
without
beyond
the
and
befell
that
through
the
his
eye
pierced
and
so
deep
it
went
till
on
cresside
it
smote
and
there
it
stent
and
suddenly
wax
wonder
sore
astoned
and
gan
her
behold
in
busy
wise
oh
very
god
thought
he
where
hast
thou
that
art
so
fair
and
goodly
to
devise
therewith
his
heart
began
to
spread
and
rise
and
soft
he
sighed
lest
men
might
him
hear
and
caught
again
his
former
cheer
was
not
with
the
least
of
her
stature
was
but
all
her
limbes
so
well
answering
were
to
womanhood
that
creature
was
never
lesse
mannish
in
seeming
and
eke
pure
wise
of
her
very
the
way
she
showed
well
that
men
might
in
her
guess
she
honour
estate
and
womanly
nobless
then
troilus
right
wonder
well
withal
began
to
like
her
moving
and
her
cheer
which
somedeal
was
for
she
let
fall
her
look
a
little
aside
in
such
mannere
what
may
i
not
stande
here
if
to
say
and
after
that
looking
gan
she
light
expression
became
that
never
thought
him
see
so
good
a
sight
more
and
of
her
look
in
him
there
gan
to
quicken
so
great
desire
and
strong
affection
that
in
his
hearte
bottom
gan
to
sticken
of
her
the
fix
and
deep
impression
and
though
he
had
up
and
down
then
was
he
glad
his
hornes
in
to
shrink
wist
he
how
to
look
or
wink
lo
he
that
held
himselfe
so
cunning
and
scorned
them
that
love
paines
drien
was
full
unware
that
love
had
his
dwelling
within
the
subtile
of
her
eyen
glances
that
suddenly
he
thought
he
felte
dien
right
with
her
look
the
spirit
in
his
heart
blessed
be
love
that
thus
can
folk
convert
she
thus
in
black
looking
to
troilus
over
all
things
he
stoode
to
behold
but
his
desire
nor
wherefore
he
stood
thus
he
neither
made
nor
worde
told
by
his
but
from
afar
manner
for
to
hold
observe
due
on
other
things
sometimes
his
look
he
cast
and
on
her
while
that
the
service
last
and
after
this
not
fully
all
awhaped
out
of
the
temple
all
easily
be
went
repenting
him
that
ever
he
had
of
love
folk
lest
fully
the
descent
of
scorn
fell
on
himself
but
what
he
meant
lest
it
were
wist
on
any
manner
side
his
woe
he
gan
dissemble
and
eke
hide
returning
to
his
palace
he
begins
hypocritically
to
smile
and
jest
at
love
servants
and
their
pains
but
by
and
by
he
has
to
dismiss
his
attendants
feigning
other
busy
needs
then
alone
in
his
chamber
he
begins
to
groan
and
sigh
and
call
up
again
cressida
form
as
he
saw
her
in
the
temple
making
a
mirror
of
his
mind
in
which
he
saw
all
wholly
her
figure
he
thinks
no
travail
or
sorrow
too
high
a
price
for
the
love
of
such
a
goodly
woman
and
full
unadvised
of
his
woe
coming
thus
took
he
purpose
love
craft
to
sue
and
thought
that
he
would
work
all
privily
first
for
to
hide
his
desire
all
a
cage
secretly
from
every
wight
all
utterly
he
might
aught
recover
be
thereby
he
gained
by
him
that
love
wide
much
spoken
yields
bitter
fruit
although
sweet
seed
be
sow
and
over
all
this
muche
more
he
thought
what
thing
to
speak
and
what
to
holden
in
and
what
to
her
to
love
he
sought
and
on
a
song
anon
right
to
begin
and
gan
loud
on
his
sorrow
for
to
win
for
with
good
hope
he
gan
thus
to
cressida
for
to
love
and
not
repent
the
song
of
troilus
if
no
love
is
o
god
why
feel
i
so
and
if
love
is
what
thing
and
which
is
he
if
love
be
good
from
whence
cometh
my
woe
if
it
be
wick
a
wonder
thinketh
me
whence
torment
and
adversity

devoting
himself
wholly
to
the
thought
of
cressida
though
he
yet
knew
not
whether
she
was
woman
or
goddess
troilus
in
spite
of
his
royal
blood
became
the
very
slave
of
love
he
set
at
naught
every
other
charge
but
to
gaze
on
her
as
often
as
he
could
thinking
so
to
appease
his
hot
fire
which
thereby
only
burned
the
hotter
he
wrought
marvellous
feats
of
arms
against
the
greeks
that
she
might
like
him
the
better
for
his
renown
then
love
deprived
him
of
sleep
and
made
his
food
his
foe
till
he
had
to
borrow
a
title
of
other
sickness
that
men
might
not
know
he
was
consumed
with
love
meantime
cressida
gave
no
sign
that
she
heeded
his
devotion
or
even
knew
of
it
and
he
was
now
consumed
with
a
new
fear
lest
she
loved
some
other
man
bewailing
his
sad
lot
ensnared
exposed
to
the
scorn
of
those
whose
love
he
had
ridiculed
wishing
himself
arrived
at
the
port
of
death
and
praying
ever
that
his
lady
might
glad
him
with
some
kind
look
troilus
is
surprised
in
his
chamber
by
his
friend
pandarus
the
uncle
of
cressida
pandarus
seeking
to
divert
his
sorrow
by
making
him
angry
jeeringly
asks
whether
remorse
of
conscience
or
devotion
or
fear
of
the
greeks
has
caused
all
this
ado
troilus
pitifully
beseeches
his
friend
to
leave
him
to
die
alone
for
die
he
must
from
a
cause
which
he
must
keep
hidden
but
pandarus
argues
against
troilus
cruelty
in
hiding
from
a
friend
such
a
sorrow
and
troilus
at
last
confesses
that
his
malady
is
love
pandarus
suggests
that
the
beloved
object
may
be
such
that
his
counsel
might
advance
his
desires
but
troilus
scouts
the
suggestion
saying
that
pandarus
could
never
govern
himself
in
love
yea
troilus
hearken
to
me
quoth
pandare
though
i
be
nice
it
happens
often
so
that
one
that
doth
full
evil
fare
an
access
of
fever
by
good
counsel
can
keep
his
friend
therefro
i
have
my
selfe
seen
a
blind
man
go
where
as
he
fell
that
looke
could
full
wide
a
fool
may
eke
a
wise
man
often
guide
a
whetstone
is
no
carving
instrument
but
yet
it
maketh
sharpe
carving
tooles
and
if
thou
that
i
have
aught
miswent
failed
eschew
thou
that
for
such
thing
to
thee
is
lesson
thus
oughte
wise
men
to
beware
by

if
so
thou
do
thy
wit
is
well
bewared
by
its
contrary
is
everything
declared
for
how
might
ever
sweetness
have
been
know
to
him
that
never
tasted
bitterness
and
no
man
knows
what
gladness
is
i
trow
that
never

eke

eke
worthiness
each

quality
is
made
as
men
may
see
and
so
the
wise
man
deemeth
more
obvious
by
the
troilus
however
still
begs
his
friend
to
leave
him
to
mourn
in
peace
for
all
his
proverbs
can
avail
nothing
but
pandarus
insists
on
plying
the
lover
with
wise
saws
arguments
reproaches
hints
that
if
he
should
die
of
love
his
lady
may
impute
his
death
to
fear
of
the
greeks
and
finally
induces
troilus
to
admit
that
the
well
of
all
his
woe
his
sweetest
foe
is
called
cressida
pandarus
breaks
into
praises
of
the
lady
and
congratulations
of
his
friend
for
so
well
fixing
his
heart
he
makes
troilus
utter
a
formal
confession
of
his
sin
in
jesting
at
lovers
and
bids
him
think
well
that
she
of
whom
rises
all
his
woe
hereafter
may
his
comfort
be
also
for
ground
that
bears
the
weedes
wick
same
bears
eke
the
wholesome
herbes
and
full
oft
next
to
the
foule
nettle
rough
and
thick
the
lily
waxeth
white
and
smooth
and
soft
and
next
the
valley
is
the
hill
aloft
and
next
the
darke
night
is
the
glad
morrow
and
also
joy
is
next
the
of
sorrow
border
pandarus
holds
out
to
troilus
good
hope
of
achieving
his
desire
and
tells
him
that
since
he
has
been
converted
from
his
wicked
rebellion
against
love
he
shall
be
made
the
best
post
of
all
love
law
and
most
grieve
love
enemies
troilus
gives
utterance
to
a
hint
of
fear
but
he
is
silenced
by
pandarus
with
another
proverb
thou
hast
full
great
care
lest
that
the
carl
should
fall
out
of
the
moon
then
the
lovesick
youth
breaks
into
a
joyous
boast
that
some
of
the
greeks
shall
smart
he
mounts
his
horse
and
plays
the
lion
in
the
field
while
pandarus
retires
to
consider
how
he
may
best
recommend
to
his
niece
the
suit
of
troilus
the
second
book
in
the
proem
to
the
second
book
the
poet
hails
the
clear
weather
that
enables
him
to
sail
out
of
those
black
waves
in
which
his
boat
so
laboured
that
he
could
scarcely
steer
that
is
the
tempestuous
matter
of
despair
that
troilus
was
in
but
now
of
hope
the
kalendes
begin
he
invokes
the
aid
of
clio
excuses
himself
to
every
lover
for
what
may
be
found
amiss
in
a
book
which
he
only
translates
and
obviating
any
objection
to
the
way
in
which
troilus
obtained
his
lady
grace
through
pandarus
mediation
says
it
seems
to
him
no
wonderful
thing
for
wighte
that
to
rome
went
held
not
one
path
nor
alway
one
mannere
eke
in
some
lands
were
all
the
game
if
that
men
far
in
love
as
men
do
here
as
thus
in
open
dealing
and
in
cheer
in
visiting
in
form
or
saying
their
saws
for
thus
men
say
each
country
hath
its
laws
eke
scarcely
be
there
in
this
place
three
that
have
in
love
done
or
said
in
all
in
all
and
so
that
which
the
poem
relates
may
not
please
the
reader
but
it
actually
was
done
or
it
shall
yet
be
done
the
book
sets
out
with
the
visit
of
pandarus
to
cressida
in
may
that
mother
is
of
monthes
glade
when
all
the
freshe
flowers
green
and
red
be
again
that
winter
deade
made
and
full
of
balm
is
floating
mead
when
phoebus
doth
his
brighte
beames
spread
right
in
the
white
bull
so
it
as
i
shall
sing
on
maye
day
the
thrid
that
pandarus
for
all
his
wise
speech
felt
eke
his
part
of
love
shottes
keen
that
could
he
so
well
of
love
preach
it
made
yet
his
hue
all
day
full
green
so
it
that
him
fell
that
day
a
in
love
for
which
full
woe
to
bed
he
went
and
made
ere
it
were
day
full
many
a
went
the
swallow
progne
with
a
sorrowful
lay
when
morrow
came
gan
make
her
waimenting
why
she
was
and
ever
lay
pandare
half
in
a
slumbering
till
she
so
nigh
him
made
her
chittering
how
tereus
gan
forth
her
sister
take
that
with
the
noise
of
her
he
did
awake
and
gan
to
call
and
him
to
arise
him
his
errand
was
to
from
troilus
and
eke
his
great
emprise
and
cast
and
knew
in
was
the
moon
to
do
voyage
and
took
his
way
full
soon
unto
his
niece
palace
there
beside
now
janus
god
of
entry
thou
him
guide
pandarus
finds
his
niece
with
two
other
ladies
in
a
paved
parlour
listening
to
a
maiden
who
reads
aloud
the
story
of
the
siege
of
thebes
greeting
the
company
he
is
welcomed
by
cressida
who
tells
him
that
for
three
nights
she
has
dreamed
of
him
after
some
lively
talk
about
the
book
they
had
been
reading
pandarus
asks
his
niece
to
do
away
her
hood
to
show
her
face
bare
to
lay
aside
the
book
to
rise
up
and
dance
and
let
us
do
to
may
some
observance
cressida
cries
out
god
forbid
and
asks
if
he
is
mad
if
that
is
a
widow
life
whom
it
better
becomes
to
sit
in
a
cave
and
read
of
holy
saints
lives
pandarus
intimates
that
he
could
tell
her
something
which
could
make
her
merry
but
he
refuses
to
gratify
her
curiosity
and
by
way
of
the
siege
and
of
hector
that
was
the
towne
wall
and
greekes
yerd
or
the
conversation
is
brought
round
to
troilus
whom
pandarus
highly
extols
as
the
wise
worthy
hector
the
second
she
has
she
says
already
heard
troilus
praised
for
his
bravery
of
them
that
her
were
liefest
praised
be
by
whom
it
would
be
most
welcome
to
her
to
be
praised
ye
say
right
sooth
quoth
pandarus
for
yesterday
who
so
had
with
him
been
might
have
wonder
upon
troilus
for
never
yet
so
thick
a
swarm
of
ne
flew
as
did
of
greekes
from
him
and
through
the
field
in
wighte
ear
there
was
no
cry
but
is
here
now
here
now
there
he
hunted
them
so
fast
there
was
but
greekes
blood
and
troilus
now
him
he
hurt
now
him
adown
he
cast
ay
where
he
went
it
was
arrayed
thus
he
was
their
death
and
shield
of
life
for
us
that
as
that
day
there
durst
him
none
withstand
while
that
he
held
his
bloody
sword
in
hand
pandarus
makes
now
a
show
of
taking
leave
but
cressida
detains
him
to
speak
of
her
affairs
then
the
business
talked
over
he
would
again
go
but
first
again
asks
his
niece
to
arise
and
dance
and
cast
her
widow
garments
to
mischance
because
of
the
glad
fortune
that
has
befallen
her
more
curious
than
ever
she
seeks
to
find
out
pandarus
secret
but
he
still
parries
her
curiosity
skilfully
hinting
all
the
time
at
her
good
fortune
and
the
wisdom
of
seizing
on
it
when
offered
in
the
end
he
tells
her
that
the
noble
troilus
so
loves
her
that
with
her
it
lies
to
make
him
live
or
die
but
if
troilus
dies
pandarus
shall
die
with
him
and
then
she
will
have
fished
fair
he
beseeches
mercy
for
his
friend
the
faire
gemme
virtueless
befall
woe
worth
the
herb
also
that
no
boot
no
remedial
woe
worth
the
beauty
that
is
rutheless
woe
worth
that
wight
that
treads
each
under
foot
and
ye
that
be
of
beauty
and
if
therewithal
in
you
there
be
no
ruth
then
is
it
harm
ye
live
by
my
truth
pandarus
makes
only
the
slight
request
that
she
will
show
troilus
somewhat
better
cheer
and
receive
visits
from
him
that
his
life
may
be
saved
urging
that
although
a
man
be
soon
going
to
the
temple
nobody
will
think
that
he
eats
the
images
and
that
such
love
of
friends
reigneth
in
all
this
town
cressida
which
that
heard
him
in
this
wise

quoth

me
devise

quoth

weeping
cressida
reproaches
her
uncle
for
giving
her
such
counsel
whereupon
pandarus
starting
up
threatens
to
kill
himself
and
would
fain
depart
but
that
his
niece
detains
him
and
with
much
reluctance
promises
to
make
troilus
good
cheer
in
honour
invited
by
cressida
to
tell
how
first
he
know
her
lover
woe
pandarus
then
relates
two
soliloquies
which
he
had
accidentally
overheard
and
in
which
troilus
had
poured
out
all
the
sorrow
of
his
passion
with
this
he
took
his
leave
and
home
he
went
ah
lord
so
was
he
glad
and
cresside
arose
no
longer
would
she
stent
but
straight
into
her
chamber
went
anon
and
sat
her
down
as
still
as
any
stone
and
word
gan
up
and
down
to
wind
that
he
had
said
as
it
came
to
her
mind
and
wax
somedeal
astonish
in
her
thought
right
for
the
newe
case
but
when
that
she
full
advised
then
she
found
right
naught
fully
of
peril
why
she
should
afeared
be
for
a
man
may
love
of
possibility
a
woman
so
that
his
heart
may
utterly
and
she
not
love
again
if
her
lest
it
so
please
but
as
she
sat
alone
and
thoughte
thus
in
field
arose
a
skirmish
all
without
and
men
cried
in
the
street
then
troilus
hath
right
now
put
to
flight
the
greekes
rout
with
that
gan
all
the
for
to
shout
cressida
household
ah
go

see
cast
up

lattice
wide
for
through
this
street

must
to
palace
ride
for
other
way
is
from
the
gates
none
of
dardanus
where
open
is
the
chain
with
that
came
he
and
all
his
folk
anon
an
easy
pace
riding
in
twain
right
as
his
was
sooth
to
sayn
fortune
for
which
men
say
may
not
disturbed
be
what
shall
of
necessity
this
troilus
sat
upon
his
bay
steed
all
armed
save
his
head
full
richely
and
wounded
was
his
horse
and
gan
to
bleed
for
which
he
rode
a
pace
full
softely
but
such
a
knightly
truly
as
was
on
him
was
not
withoute
fail
to
look
on
mars
that
god
is
of
battaile
so
like
a
man
of
armes
and
a
knight
he
was
to
see
full
fill
of
high
prowess
for
both
he
had
a
body
and
a
might
to
do
that
thing
as
well
as
hardiness
and
eke
to
see
him
in
his
him
dress
so
fresh
so
young
so
seemed
he
it
was
a
heaven
on
him
for
to
see
his
helmet
was
in
twenty
places
that
by
a
hung
his
back
behind
his
shield
was
with
swords
and
maces
in
which
men
might
many
an
arrow
find
that
had
both
horn
and
nerve
and
rind
and
ay
the
people
cried
here
comes
our
joy
and
next
his
brother
holder
up
of
troy
for
which
he
wax
a
little
red
for
shame
when
he
so
heard
the
people
on
him
cryen
that
to
behold
it
was
a
noble
game
how
soberly
he
cast
adown
his
eyen
cresside
anon
gan
all
his
cheer
espien
and
let
it
in
her
heart
so
softly
sink
that
to
herself
she
said
who
gives
me
drink
for
of
her
owen

thus
lo
this
is
he
which
that
mine
uncle
swears
he
might
be
dead
i
on
him
have
mercy
and
pity
and
with
that
thought
for
pure
shame
she
gan
in
her
head
to
pull
and
that
full
fast
while
he
and
all
the
people
forth
by
pass
and
gan
to
cast
and
rollen
up

but
most
her
favour
was
for
his
distress

all
for
her
and
thought
it
were
ruth
to
slay
such
one
if
that
he
meant

truth
and
lord
so
gan
she
in
her
heart
argue
of

for

with

that
he
loveth
me
what
dishonour
were
it
unto

this
may
i

i
i

who
so
taketh

and
so
men
say
in

and
keep
alway
mine
honour
and
my

by
all
right
i
may
do
to
me
no
shame
but
right
as
when
the
sunne
shineth
bright
in
march
that
changeth
oftentime
his
face
and
that
a
cloud
is
put
with
wind
to
flight
which
overspreads
the
sun
as
for
a
space
a
cloudy
thought
gan
through
her
hearte
pace
that
overspread
her
brighte
thoughtes
all
so
that
for
fear
almost
she
gan
to
fall
the
cloudy
thought
is
of
the
loss
of
liberty
and
security
the
stormy
life
and
the
malice
of
wicked
tongues
that
love
entails
but
after
that
her
thought
began
to
clear
and
saide
he
that
nothing
undertakes
nothing
achieveth
be
him
or
dear
or
and
with
another
thought
her
hearte
quakes
then
sleepeth
hope
and
after
dread
awakes
now
hot
now
cold
but
thus
betwixt
the

up
and
wente
forth
to
play
recreation
adown
the

anon
right
then
she
went
into
a

with
her

three
and
up

down
they
made
many

and
she

it

was
for
to

other
of

clear
that

her
voice
to
hear
antigone
song
is
of
virtuous
love
for
a
noble
object
and
it
is
singularly
fitted
to
deepen
the
impression
made
on
the
mind
of
cressida
by
the
brave
aspect
of
troilus
and
by
her
own
cogitations
the
singer
having
praised
the
lover
and
rebuked
the
revilers
of
love
proceeds
what
is
the
sunne
worse
of

that
a

for
feebleness
of

not

and

whether
there
is
such
bliss
among
these
lovers
as
they
can

replies
confidently
in

glow
with
respect

gives
some
shrewd
hints
touching
thy
letter
thou
art
wise
enough
i
wot
thou
it
dignely
not
write
it
or
make
it
with
these
argumentes
tough
nor
nor
craftily
it
write
beblot
it
with
thy
tears
also
a

and
if
thou
write
a
goodly
word
all
soft
though
it
be
good
rehearse
it
not
too
oft
for
though

pandarus
bears
it
to
cressida
she
refuses
to
receive

or

that
toucheth
such
mattere
but
he
thrusts
it
into
her
bosom
challenging
her
to
throw
it
away
she
retains
it
takes
the
first
opportunity
of
escaping
to
her
chamber
to
read
it

it
wholly
good
and
under
her
uncle
dictation
endites
a
reply
telling
her
lover
that
she
will
not
make
herself
bound
in
love
but
as
his
sister
him
to
please
she
would
aye
fain
be
glad
to

his

an
ease
pandarus
under
pretext
of
inquiring
who
is
the
owner
of
the
house
opposite
has
gone
to
the
window
cressida
takes
her
letter
to
him
there
and
tells
him
that
she
never
did
a
thing
with
more
pain
than
write
the
words
to
which
he
had
constrained
her
as
they
sit
side
by
side
on
a
stone
of
jasper
on
a
cushion
of
beaten
gold
troilus
rides
by
in
all
his
goodliness
cressida
waxes
as
red
as
rose
as
she
sees
him
salute
humbly
with
dreadful
cheer
and
oft
his
hues
mue
change
she
likes
all
his
person
his
array
his
look
his
cheer
his
goodly
manner
and
his
gentleness
so
that
however
she
may
have
been
before
to
goode
hope
now
hath
she
caught
a
thorn
she
shall
not
pull
it
out
this
nexte
week
pandarus
striking
the
iron
when
it
is
hot
asks
his
niece
to
grant
troilus
an
interview
but
she
strenuously
declines
for
fear
of
scandal
and
because
it
is
all
too
soon
to
allow
him
so
great
a
liberty
her
purpose
being
to
love
him
unknown
of
all
and
guerdon
reward
him
with
nothing
but
with
sight
pandarus
has
other
intentions
and
while
troilus
writes
daily
letters
with
increasing
love
he
contrives
the
means
of
an
interview
seeking
out
deiphobus
the
brother
of
troilus
he
tells
him
that
cressida
is
in
danger
of
violence
from
polyphete
and
asks
protection
for
her
deiphobus
gladly
complies
promises
the
protection
of
hector
and
helen
and
goes
to
invite
cressida
to
dinner
on
the
morrow
meantime
pandarus
instructs
troilus
to
go
to
the
house
of
deiphobus
plead
an
access
of
his
fever
for
remaining
all
night
and
keep
his
chamber
next
day

says
the
crafty
promoter
of

borrowing
a
phrase
from
the

hold
thee

tryst
close
and
i
shall

unsuspicious
of

cressida
comes
to
dinner
and
at
table
helen
pandarus
and
others
praise
the
absent
troilus
until
her
heart
laughs
for
very
pride
that
she
has
the
love
of
such
a
knight
after
dinner
they
speak
of
cressida
business
all
confirm
deiphobus
assurances
of
protection
and
aid
and
pandarus
suggests
that
since
troilus
is
there
cressida
shall
herself
tell
him
her
case
helen
and
deiphobus
alone
accompany
pandarus
to
troilus
chamber
there
troilus
produces
some
documents
relating
to
the
public
weal
which
hector
has
sent
for
his
opinion
helen
and
deiphobus
engrossed
in
perusal
and
discussion
roam
out
of
the
chamber
by
a
stair
into
the
garden
while
pandarus
goes
down
to
the
hall
and
pretending
that
his
brother
and
helen
are
still
with

brings
cressida
to
her
lover
the

pandarus
whispering
in
his
niece
ear
counsel
to
be
merciful
and
kind
to
her
lover
that
hath
for
her
such
pain
while
troilus
lies
in
a
kankerdort
hearing
the
whispering
without
and
wondering
what
he
shall

of

pandarus
almost
beside

for
joy
falls
on
his
knees
to
thank
venus
and
cupid
declaring
that
for
this
miracle
he
hears
all
the
bells
ring
then
with
a
warning
to
be
ready
at
his
call
to
meet
at
his
house
he
parts
the
lovers
and
attends
cressida
while
she
takes
leave
of
the
household
troilus
all
the
time
groaning
at
the
deceit
practised
on
his
brother
and
helen
when
he
has
got
rid
of
them
by
feigning
weariness
pandarus
returns
to
the
chamber
and
spends
the
night
with
him
in
converse
the
zealous
friend
begins
to
speak
in
a
sober
wise
to
troilus
reminding
him
of
his
now
all
at
an
end
so
that
through
me
thou
standest
now
in
way
to
fare
well
i
say
it
for
no
boast
and
thou
why
for
shame
it
is
to
say
for
thee
have
i
begun
a
game
to
play
which
that
i
never
shall
do
for
other
although
he
were
a
thousand
fold
my
brother
that
is
to
say
for
thee
i
am
become
betwixte
game
and
earnest
such
a
instrument
as
make
women
unto
men
to
come
thou
thyselfe
what
that
woulde
mean
for
thee
have
i
my
niece
of
vices
clean
devoid
so
fully
made
thy
to
trust
of
nature
that
all
shall
be
right
thyselfe
lust
you
but
god
that
wot
take
i
to
witness
that
never
this
for
i
wrought
of
gain
but
only
to
thy
distress
for
which
well
nigh
thou
diedst
as
me
thought
but
goode
brother
do
now
as
thee
ought
for
godde
love
and
keep
her
out
of
blame
since
thou
art
wise
so
save
thou
her
name
for
well
thou
the
name
yet
of
her
among
the
people
as
who
saith
hallow
is
for
that
man
is
unborn
i
dare
well
swear
that
ever
yet
that
she
did
amiss
but
woe
is
me
that
i
that
cause
all
this
may
thinke
that
she
is
my
niece
dear
and
i
her
eme
and
traitor
eke
well
and
were
it
wist
that
i
through
mine
engine
contrivance
had
in
my
niece
put
this
to
do
thy
lust
and
wholly
to
be
thine
why
all
the
people
would
upon
it
cry
and
say
that
i
the
worste
treachery
did
in
this
case
that
ever
was
begun
and
she
fordone
and
thou
right
naught
therefore
ere
going
a
step
further
pandarus
prays
troilus
to
give
him
pledges
of
secrecy
and
impresses
on
his
mind
the
mischiefs
that
flow
from
vaunting
in
affairs
of
love
of
kind
by
his
very
nature
he
says
no
vaunter
is
to
be
believed
for
a
vaunter
and
a
liar
all
is
one
as
thus
i
a
woman
granteth
me
assume
her
love
and
saith
that
other
will
she
none
and
i
am
sworn
to
holden
it
secre
and
after
i
go
tell
it
two
or
three
i
am
a
vaunter
at
the
least
and
eke
a
liar
for
i
break
my
hest
now
looke
then
if
they
be
not
to
blame
such
manner
folk
what
shall
i
call
them
what
that
them
avaunt
of
women
and
by
name
that
never
yet
them
this
nor
that
much
nor
knowe
them
no
more
than
mine
old
hat
less
granted
no
wonder
is
so
god
me
sende
heal
though
women
dreade
with
us
men
to
deal
i
say
not
this
for
no
mistrust
of
you
nor
for
no
wise
men
but
for
fooles
nice
and
for
the
harm
that
in
the
world
is
now
as
well
for
folly
oft
as
for
malice
for
well
wot
i
that
in
wise
folk
that
vice
no
woman
dreads
if
she
be
well
advised
for
wise
men
be
by
fooles
harm
chastised
instructed
so
pandarus
begs
troilus
to
keep
silent
promises
to
be
true
all
his
days
and
assures
him
that
he
shall
have
all
that
he
will
in
the
love
of
cressida
thou
knowest
what
thy
lady
granted
thee
and
day
is
set
the
charters
up
to
make
who
mighte
telle
half
the
joy
and
feast
which
that
the
soul
of
troilus
then
felt
hearing
of
pandarus
behest
his
olde
woe
that
made
his
hearte
swelt
die
gan
then
for
joy
to
wasten
and
to
melt
and
all
the
reheating
of
his
sighes
sore
at
ones
fled
he
felt
of
them
no
more
but
right
so
as
these
and
these
hayes
and
that
have
in
winter
deade
been
and
dry
reveste
them
in
greene
when
that
may
is
when
best
to
play
one
right
in
that
selfe
wise
sooth
to
say
wax
suddenly
his
hearte
full
of
joy
that
gladder
was
there
never
man
in
troy
troilus
solemnly
swears
that
never
for
all
the
good
that
god
made
under
sun
will
he
reveal
what
pandarus
asks
him
to
keep
secret
offering
to
die
a
thousand
times
if
need
were
and
to
follow
his
friend
as
a
slave
all
his
life
in
proof
of
his
gratitude
but
here
with
all
my
heart
i
thee
beseech
that
never
in
me
thou
such
folly
as
i
shall
say
me
thoughte
by
thy
speech
that
this
which
thou
me
dost
for
company
i
shoulde
ween
it
were
a
bawdery
bawd
action
am
not
wood
all
if
i
lewed
be
am
not
mad
though
it
is
not
one
that
wot
i
well
pardie
i
be
but
he
that
goes
for
gold
or
for
richess
on
such
messages
call
him
thee
lust
you
and
this
that
thou
dost
call
it
gentleness
compassion
and
fellowship
and
trust
depart
it
so
for
widewhere
is
wist
how
that
there
is
diversity
betwixte
thinges
like
as
i
have
lear
and
that
thou
know
i
think
it
not
nor
ween
that
this
service
a
shame
be
or
a
jape
for
jeering
i
have
my
faire
sister
polyxene
cassandr
helene
or
any
of
the
frape
be
she
never
so
fair
or
well
telle
me
which
thou
wilt
of
one
to
have
for
thine
and
let
me
then
alone
then
beseeching
pandarus
soon
to
perform
out
the
great
enterprise
of
crowning
his
love
for
cressida
troilus
bade
his
friend
good
night
on
the
morrow
troilus
burned
as
the
fire
for
hope
and
pleasure
yet
he
not
forgot
his
wise
governance
control
but
in
himself
with
manhood
gan
restrain
each
deed
and
each
unbridled
cheer
that
alle
those
that
live
sooth
to
sayn
should
not
have
wist
by
word
or
by
mannere
what
that
he
meant
as
touching
this
mattere
from
wight
as
far
as
is
the
cloud
he
was
so
well
dissimulate
he
could
and
all
the
while
that
i
now
narrate
this
was
his
life
with
all
his
fulle
might
by
day
he
was
in
marte
high
service
that
is
to
say
in
armes
as
a
knight
and
for
the
moste
part
the
longe
night
he
lay
and
thought
how
that
he
mighte
serve
his
lady
best
her
for
to
deserve
i
will
not
swear
although
he
laye
soft
that
in
his
thought
he
somewhat
diseas
nor
that
he
turned
on
his
pillows
oft
and
would
of
that
him
missed
have
been
seis
but
in
such
case
men
be
not
alway
pleas
for
aught
i
wot
no
more
than
was
he
that
can
i
of
possibility
but
certain
is
to
purpose
for
to
go
that
in
this
while
as
written
is
in
gest
history
of
he
saw
his
lady
sometimes
and
also
these
events
she
with
him
spake
when
that
she
and
lest
and
and
by
their
both
advice
as
was
the
best
full
in
this
need
careful
so
as
they
durst
how
far
they
would
proceed
but
it
was
spoken
in
short
a
wise
briefly
and
always
in
such
in
such
await
alway
and
in
such
fear
vigilance
and
fear
of
being
lest
any
wight
divinen
or
found
out
by
would
of
their
speech
or
to
it
lay
an
ear
all
this
world
them
not
so
lefe
were
wanted
more
than
as
that
cupido
would
them
grace
send
anything
in
the
to
maken
of
their
speeches
right
an
end
but
thilke
little
that
they
spake
or
wrought
his
wise
took
ay
of
all
such
heed
it
seemed
her
he
wiste
what
she
thought
withoute
word
so
that
it
was
no
need
to
bid
him
aught
to
do
nor
aught
forbid
for
which
she
thought
that
love
came
it
late
of
alle
joy
had
open
her
the
gate
troilus
by
his
discretion
his
secrecy
and
his
devotion
made
ever
a
deeper
lodgment
in
cressida
heart
so
that
she
thanked
god
twenty
thousand
times
that
she
had
met
with
a
man
who
as
she
felt
was
to
her
a
wall
of
steel
and
shield
from
displeasance
while
pandarus
ever
actively
fanned
the
fire
so
passed
a
time
sweet
of
tranquil
and
harmonious
love
the
only
drawback
being
that
the
lovers
might
not
often
meet
nor
leisure
have
their
speeches
to
fulfil
at
last
pandarus
found
an
occasion
for
bringing
them
together
at
his
house
unknown
to
anybody
and
put
his
plan
in
execution
for
he
with
great
deliberation
had
thing
that
hereto
might
of
service
forecast
and
put
in
execution
and
neither
left
for
cost
nor
for
travail
come
if
them
list
them
shoulde
nothing
fail
for
to
be
in
aught
espied
there
that
wiste
he
an
impossible
were
knew
it
was
that
they
could
be
discovered
and
it
clear
was
in
the
wind
doubt
of
pie
and
every
now
all
is
well
for
all
this
world
is
blind
in
this
mattere
bothe
and
tame
this
timber
is
all
ready
for
to
frame
us
lacketh
naught
but
that
we
a
certain
hour
in
which
we
come
troilus
had
informed
his
household
that
if
at
any
time
he
was
missing
he
had
gone
to
worship
at
a
certain
temple
of
apollo
and
first
to
see
the
holy
laurel
quake
or
that
the
godde
spake
out
of
the
tree
so
at
the
changing
of
the
moon
when
the
welkin
shope
him
for
to
rain
when
the
sky
was
preparing
to
rain
pandarus
went
to
invite
his
niece
to
supper
solemnly
assuring
her
that
troilus
was
out
of
the
town
though
all
the
time
he
was
safely
shut
up
till
midnight
in
a
little
stew
whence
through
a
hole
he
joyously
watched
the
arrival
of
his
mistress
and
her
fair
niece
antigone
with
half
a
score
of
her
women
after
supper
pandaras
did
everything
to
amuse
his
niece
he
sung
he
play
he
told
a
tale
of
wade
at
last
she
would
take
her
leave
but
the
bente
moone
with
her
hornes
pale
saturn
and
jove
in
cancer
joined
were
that
made
such
a
rain
from
avail
that
manner
woman
that
was
there
had
of
this
smoky
rain
a
very
fear
at
which
pandarus
laugh
and
saide
then
now
were
it
time
a
lady
to
go
hen
he
therefore
presses
cressida
to
remain
all
night
she
complies
with
a
good
grace
and
after
the
sleeping
cup
has
gone
round
all
retire
to
their
chambers
cressida
that
she
may
not
be
disturbed
by
the
rain
and
thunder
being
lodged
in
the
inner
closet
of
pandarus
who
to
lull
suspicion
occupies
the
outer
chamber
his
niece
women
sleeping
in
the
intermediate
apartment
when
all
is
quiet
pandarus
liberates
troilus
and
by
a
secret
passage
brings
him
to
the
chamber
of
cressida
then
going
forward
alone
to
his
niece
after
calming
her
fears
of
discovery
he
tells
her
that
her
lover
has
through
a
gutter
by
a
privy
went
a
secret
passage
come
to
his
house
in
all
this
rain
mad
with
grief
because
a
friend
has
told
him
that
she
loves
horastes
suddenly
cold
about
her
heart
cressida
promises
that
on
the
morrow
she
will
reassure
her
lover
but
pandarus
scouts
the
notion
of
delay
laughs
to
scorn
her
proposal
to
send
her
ring
in
pledge
of
her
truth
and
finally
by
pitiable
accounts
of
troilus
grief
induces
her
to
receive
him
and
reassure
him
at
once
with
her
own
lips
this
troilus
full
soon
on
knees
him
set
full
soberly
right
by
her
bedde
head
and
in
his
beste
wise
his
lady
but
lord
how
she
wax
suddenly
all
red
and
thought
anon
how
that
she
would
be
dead
she
coulde
not
one
word
aright
out
bring
so
suddenly
for
his
sudden
coming
cressida
though
thinking
that
her
servant
and
her
knight
should
not
have
doubted
her
truth
yet
sought
to
remove
his
jealousy
and
offered
to
submit
to
any
ordeal
or
oath
he
might
impose
then
weeping
she
covered
her
face
and
lay
silent
but
now
exclaims
the
poet
but
now
help
god
to
quenchen
all
this
sorrow
so
hope
i
that
he
shall
for
he
best
may
for
i
have
seen
of
a
full
misty
morrow
followen
oft
a
merry
summer
day
and
after
winter
cometh
greene
may
folk
see
all
day
and
eke
men
read
in
stories
that
after
sharpe
be
victories
struggles
believing
his
mistress
to
be
angry
troilus
felt
the
cramp
of
death
seize
on
his
heart
and
down
he
fell
all
suddenly
in
swoon
pandarus
into
bed
him
cast
and
called
on
his
niece
to
pull
out
the
thorn
that
stuck
in
his
heart
by
promising
that
she
would
all
forgive
she
whispered
in
his
ear
the
assurance
that
she
was
not
wroth
and
at
last
under
her
caresses
he
recovered
consciousness
to
find
her
arm
laid
over
him
to
hear
the
assurance
of
her
forgiveness
and
receive
her
frequent
kisses
fresh
vows
and
explanations
passed
and
cressida
implored
forgiveness
of
her
own
sweet
heart
for
the
pain
she
had
caused
him
surprised
with
sudden
bliss
troilus
put
all
in
hand
and
strained
his
lady
fast
in
his
arms
what
might
or
may
the
seely
innocent
larke
say
when
that
the
sperhawk
sparrowhawk
hath

which
that
felt

of

many
renewals
of
their
pleasure
and
of
their
bitter
chidings
of
the
day
the
effects
of
love
on
troilus
are
altogether
refining
and
ennobling
as
may
be
inferred
from
the
song
which
he
sung
often
to
pandarus
the
second
song
of

that

that

of

doubtless
no

was
him
to
beseech
despicable
to
honour

glad
was
he

gan

and
other
vice
the
fourth
book
a
brief
proem
to
the
fourth
book
prepares
us
for
the
treachery
of
fortune
to
troilus
from
whom
she
turned
away
her
bright
face
and
took
of
him
no
heed
and
cast
him
clean
out
of
his
lady
grace
and
on
her
wheel
she
set
up
diomede
then
the
narrative
describes
a
skirmish
in
which
the
trojans
were
worsted
and
antenor
with
many
of
less
note
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
greeks
a
truce
was
proclaimed
for
the
exchange
of
prisoners
and
as
soon
as
calchas
heard
the
news
he
came
to
the
assembly
of
the
greeks
to
bid
a
boon
having
gained
audience
he
reminded
the
besiegers
how
he
had
come
from
troy
to
aid
and
encourage
them
in
their
enterprise
willing
to
lose
all
that
he
had
in
the
city
except
his
daughter
cressida
whom
he
bitterly
reproached
himself
for
leaving
behind
and
now
with
streaming
tears
and
pitiful
prayer
he
besought
them
to
exchange
antenor
for
cressida
assuring
them
that
the
day
was
at
hand
when
they
should
have
both
town
and
people
the
soothsayer
petition
was
granted
and
the
ambassadors
charged
to
negotiate
the
exchange
entering
the
city
told
their
errand
to
king
priam
and
his
parliament
this
troilus
was
present
in
the
place
when
asked
was
for
antenor
cresside
for
which
to
change
soon
began
his
face
as
he
that
with
the
wordes
well
nigh
died
but
natheless
he
no
word
to
it
seid
lest
men
should
his
affection
espy
with
manne
heart
he
gan
his
sorrows
drie
and
full
of
anguish
and
of
grisly
dread
abode
what
other
lords
would
to
it
say
and
if
they
woulde
grant
as
god
forbid
of
her
then
thought
he
thinges
tway
first
for
to
save
her
honour
and
what
way
he
mighte
best
of
her
withstand
this
cast
he
then
how
all
this
mighte
stand
love
made
him
alle
to
do
her
bide
to
make
her
and
rather
die
than
that
she
shoulde
go
but
reason
said
him
on
the
other
side
without
of
her
do
thou
not
so
lest
for
thy
worke
she
would
be
thy
foe
and
say
that
through
thy
meddling
is
blown
abroad
your
bothe
love
where
it
was
unknow
for
which
he
gan
deliberate
for
the
best
that
though
the
lordes
woulde
that
she
went
he
woulde
suffer
them
grant
what
lest
and
tell
his
lady
first
what
that
they
meant
and
when
that
she
had
told
him
her
intent
thereafter
would
he
worken
all
so
blive
though
all
the
world
against
it
woulde
strive
hector
which
that
full
well
the
greekes
heard
for
antenor
how
they
would
have
cresseide
gan
it
withstand
and
soberly
answer
sirs
she
is
no
prisoner
he
said
i
know
not
on
you
who
this
charge
laid
but
for
my
part
ye
may
well
soon
him
tell
we
here
no
women
for
to
sell
accustomed
the
noise
of
the
people
then
upstart
at
once
as
as
blaze
of
straw
on
fire
furious
for
woulde
for
the
nonce
they
shoulde
their
confusion
desire
hector
quoth
they
what
may
you
inspire
this
woman
thus
to
shield
and
lose
us
dan
antenor
a
wrong
way
now
ye
choose
that
is
so
wise
and
eke
so
bold
baroun
and
we
have
need
of
folk
as
men
may
see
he
eke
is
one
the
greatest
of
this
town
o
hector
lette
such
fantasies
be
o
king
priam
quoth
they
lo
thus
say
we
that
all
our
will
is
to
forego
cresseide
and
to
deliver
antenor
they
pray
though
hector
often
prayed
them
nay
it
was
resolved
that
cressida
should
be
given
up
for
antenor
then
the
parliament
dispersed
troilus
hastened
home
to
his
chamber
shut
himself
up
alone
and
threw
himself
on
his
bed
and
as
in
winter
leaves
be
bereft
each
after
other
till
the
tree
be
bare
so
that
there
is
but
bark
and
branch
lay
troilus
bereft
of
each
welfare
in
the
blacke
bark
of
care

troilus
declares
that
while

lives
he
will
bewail
his
misfortune
in

will
never

for

that
i
thee
hadde
where

would
in
troy
soon
troilus
through
excess
of
grief
fell
into
a
trance
in
which
he
was
found
by
pandarus
who
had
gone
almost
distracted
at
the
news
that
cressida
was
to
be
exchanged
for
antenor
at
his
friend
arrival
troilus
gan
as
the
snow
against
the
sun
to
melt
the
two
mingled
their
tears
a
while
then
pandarus
strove
to
comfort
the
woeful
lover
he
admitted
that
never
had
a
stranger
ruin
than
this
been
wrought
by
fortune
but
tell
me
this
why
thou
art
now
so
mad
to
sorrow
thus
why
thou
in
this
wise
since
thy
desire
all
wholly
hast
thou
had
so
that
by
right
it
ought
enough
suffice
but
i
that
never
felt
in
my
service
a
friendly
cheer
or
looking
of
an
eye
let
me
thus
weep
and
wail
until
i
die
and
over
all
this
as
thou
well
thy
selve
this
town
is
full
of
ladies
all
about
and
my
doom
fairer
than
suche
twelve
my
as
ever
she
was
shall
i
find
in
some
rout
yea
one
or
two
withouten
any
doubt
be
glad
mine
owen
deare
brother
if
she
be
lost
we
shall
recover
another
what
god
forbid
alway
that
each
pleasance
in
one
thing
were
and
in
none
other
wight
if
one
can
sing
another
can
well
dance
if
this
be
goodly
she
is
glad
and
light
and
this
is
fair
and
that
can
good
aright
each
for
his
virtue
holden
is
full
dear
both
heroner
and
falcon
for

and
eke
as
writ
zausis
that
was
full
wise
the
newe
love
out
chaseth
oft
the
old
and
upon
new
case
lieth
new
advice
think
eke
thy
life
to
save
thou
art
hold
such
fire
process
shall
of
kinde
cold
grow
cold
by
for
since
it
is
but
casual
pleasance
process
of
some
shall
put
it
out
of
remembrance
for
all
so
sure
as
day
comes
after
night
the
newe
love
labour
or
other
woe
or
elles
seldom
seeing
of
a
wight
do
old
affections
all
go
and
for
thy
part
thou
shalt
have
one
of
with
thy
bitter
paine
smart
absence
of
her
shall
drive
her
out
of
heart
these
wordes
said
he
the
nones
all
for
the
to
help
his
friend
lest
he
for
sorrow
died
for
doubteless
to
do
his
woe
to
fall
his
woe
he
not
what
that
he
said
but
troilus
that
nigh
for
sorrow
died
took
little
heed
of
all
that
ever
he
meant
one
ear
it
heard
at
out
it
went
but
at
the
last
he
answer
and
said
friend
this
leachcraft
or
thus
to
be
were
well
if
that
i
were
a
fiend
to
her
that
true
is
unto
me
i
pray
god
let
this
counsel
never
the
but
do
me
rather
anon
right
here
ere
i
thus
do
as
thou
me
wouldest
lear
troilus
protests
that
his
lady
shall
have
him
wholly
hers
till
death
and
debating
the
counsels
of
his
friend
declares
that
even
if
he
would
he
could
not
love
another
then
he
points
out
the
folly
of
not
lamenting
the
loss
of
cressida
because
she
had
been
his
in
ease
and
felicity
while
pandarus
himself
though
he
thought
it
so
light
to
change
to
and
fro
in
love
had
not
done
busily
his
might
to
change
her
that
wrought
him
all
the
woe
of
his
unprosperous
suit
if
thou
hast
had
in
love
ay
yet
mischance
and
canst
it
not
out
of
thine
hearte
drive
i
that
lived
in
and
in
pleasance
with
her
as
much
as
creature
alive
how
should
i
that
forget
and
that
so
blive
o
where
hast
thou
been
so
long
hid
in
mew
that
canst
so
well
and
formally
argue
the
lover
condemns
the
whole
discourse
of
his
friend
as
unworthy
and
calls
on
death
the
ender
of
all
sorrows
to
come
to
him
and
quench
his
heart
with
his
cold
stroke
then
he
distils
anew
in
tears
as
liquor
out
of
alembic
and
pandarus
is
silent
for
a
while
till
he
bethinks
him
to
recommend
to
troilus
the
carrying
off
of
cressida
art
thou
in
troy
and
hast
no
hardiment
daring
boldness
to
take
a
woman
which
that
loveth
thee
but
troilus
reminds
his
counsellor
that
all
the
war
had
come
from
the
ravishing
of
a
woman
by
might
the
abduction
of
helen
by
paris
and
that
it
would
not
beseem
him
to
withstand
his
father
grant
since
the
lady
was
to
be
changed
for
the
town
good
he
has
dismissed
the
thought
of
asking
cressida
from
his
father
because
that
would
be
to
injure
her
fair
fame
to
no
purpose
for
priam
could
not
overthrow
the
decision
of
so
high
a
place
as
parliament
while
most
of
all
he
fears
to
perturb
her
heart
with
violence
to
the
slander
of
her
name
for
he
must
hold
her
honour
dearer
than
himself
in
every
case
as
lovers
ought
of
right
thus
am
i
in
desire
and
reason
twight
desire
for
to
disturbe
her
me
redeth
and
reason
will
not
so
my
hearte
dreadeth
in
doubt
thus
weeping
that
he
coulde
never
cease
he
said
alas
how
shall
i
wretche
fare
for
well
feel
i
alway
my
love
increase
and
hope
is
less
and
less
alway
pandare
increasen
eke
the
causes
of
my
care
so
n
ill
my
hearte
brest
will
not
for
us
in
love
there
is
but
little
rest
my
heart
break
pandare
answered
friend
thou
for
me
do
as
thee
list
but
had
i
it
so
hot
and
thine
estate
she
shoulde
go
with
me
though
all
this
town
cried
on
this
thing
by
note
i
would
not
all
that
noise
a
groat
for
when
men
have
well
cried
then
will
they
rown
eke
wonder
lasts
but
nine
nights
in
town
divine
not
in
reason
ay
so
deep
nor
courteously
but
help
thyself
anon
is
that
others
than
thyselfe
weep
and
namely
since
ye
two
be
all
one
rise
up
for
by
my
head
she
shall
not
and
rather
be
in
blame
a
little
found
than
here
as
a
gnat
withoute
wound
it
is
no
shame
unto
you
nor
no
vice
her
to
withholde
that
ye
loveth
most
she
might
holde
thee
for
nice
to
let
her
go
thus
unto
the
greeks
host
think
eke
fortune
as
well
thyselfe
wost
helpeth
the
hardy
man
to
his
emprise
and
wretches
for
their
cowardice
and
though
thy
lady
would
a
her
grieve
thou
shalt
thyself
thy
peace
thereafter
make
but
as
to
me
certain
i
can
not
that
she
would
it
as
now
for
evil
take
why
shoulde
then
for
fear
thine
hearte
quake
think
eke
how
paris
hath
that
is
thy
brother
a
love
and
why
shalt
thou
not
have
another
and
troilus
one
thing
i
dare
thee
swear
that
if
cressida
which
that
is
thy
lief
now
loveth
thee
as
well
as
thou
dost
her
god
help
me
so
she
will
not
take
though
thou
do
boot
this
mischief
a
remedy
and
if
she
willeth
from
thee
for
to
pass
then
is
she
false
so
love
her
well
the
lass
forthy
take
heart
and
think
right
as
a
knight
through
love
is
broken
all
day
law
now
somewhat
thy
courage
and
thy
might
have
mercy
on
thyself
any
awe
spite
of
any
let
not
this
wretched
woe
thine
hearte
gnaw
but
manly
set
the
world
on
six
and
seven
and
if
thou
die
a
martyr
go
to
heaven
pandarus
promises
his
friend
all
aid
in
the
enterprise
it
is
agreed
that
cressida
shall
be
carried
off
but
only
with
her
own
consent
and
pandarus
sets
out
for
his
niece
house
to
arrange
an
interview
meantime
cressida
has
heard
the
news
and
caring
nothing
for
her
father
but
everything
for
troilus
she
burns
in
love
and
fear
unable
to
tell
what
she
shall
do
but
as
men
see
in
town
and
all
about
that
women
friendes
to
visite
accustomed
so
to
cresside
of
women
came
a
rout
for
piteous
joy
and
her
delight
to
please
and
with
their
tales
enough
a
mite
worth
a
these
women
which
that
in
the
city
dwell
they
set
them
down
and
said
as
i
shall
tell
quoth
first
that
one
i
am
glad
truely
because
of
you
that
shall
your
father
see
another
said
so
am
not
i
for
all
too
little
hath
she
with
us
be
quoth
then
the
third
i
hope
that
she
shall
bringen
us
the
peace
on
side
then
when
she
goes
almighty
god
her
guide
those
wordes
and
those
womanishe
thinges
she
heard
them
right
as
though
she
were
in
some
for
god
it
wot
her
heart
on
other
thing
is
other
place
although
the
body
sat
among
them
there
her
is
always
elleswhere
for
troilus
full
fast
her
soule
sought
withoute
word
on
him
alway
she
thought
these
women
that
thus
weened
her
to
please
aboute
naught
gan
all
their
tales
spend
such
vanity
ne
can
do
her
no
ease
as
she
that
all
this
meane
while
of
other
passion
than
that
they
wend
supposed
so
that
she
felt
almost
her
hearte
die
for
woe
and
of
that
company
for
whiche
she
no
longer
might
restrain
her
teares
they
began
so
up
to
well
that
gave
signes
of
her
bitter
pain
in
which
her
spirit
was
and
muste
dwell
her
from
into
which
hell
she
fallen
was
since
she
the
sight
of
troilus
and
sorrowfully
she
sight
and
thilke
fooles
sitting
her
about
weened
that
she
had
wept
and
sore
because
that
she
should
out
of
that
depart
and
never
playe
with
them
more
and
they
that
hadde
knowen
her
of
yore
saw
her
so
weep
and
thought
it
kindeness
and
each
of
them
wept
eke
for
her
distress
and
busily
they
her
comfort
of
thing
god
wot
on
which
she
little
thought
and
with
their
tales
weened
her
disport
and
to
be
glad
they
her
besought
but
such
an
ease
therewith
they
in
her
wrought
right
as
a
man
is
eased
for
to
feel
for
ache
of
head
to
claw
him
on
his
heel
but
after
all
this
vanity
they
took
their
leave
and
home
they
wenten
all
cressida
full
of
sorrowful
pity
into
her
chamber
up
went
out
of
the
hall
and
on
her
bed
she
gan
for
dead
to
fall
in
purpose
never
thennes
for
to
rise
and
thus
she
wrought
as
i
shall
you
devise
she
rent
her
sunny
hair
wrung
her
hands
wept
and
bewailed
her
fate
vowing
that
since
for
the
cruelty
she
could
handle
neither
sword
nor
dart
she
would
abstain
from
meat
and
drink
until
she
died
as
she
lamented
pandarus
entered
making
her
complain
a
thousand
times
more
at
the
thought
of
all
the
joy
which
he
had
given
her
with
her
lover
but
he
somewhat
soothed
her
by
the
prospect
of
troilus
visit
and
by
the
counsel
to
contain
her
grief
when
he
should
come
then
pandarus
went
in
search
of
troilus
whom
he
found
solitary
in
a
temple
as
one
that
had
ceased
to
care
for
life
for
right
thus
was
his
argument
alway
he
said
he
was
but
lorne
ruined
for
all
that
comes
comes
by
necessity
thus
to
be
lorn
it
is
my
destiny
ruined
for
certainly
this
wot
i
well
he
said
that
foresight
of
the
divine
hath
seen
alway
me
to
cresseide
since
god
sees
thing
of
doubtance
and
them
disposeth
through
his
ordinance
in
their
merites
soothly
for
to
be
as
they
should
come
by
predestiny
but
natheless
alas
whom
shall
i
for
there
be
greate
many
one
that
destiny
through
argumentes
preve
and
some
say
that
there
is
none
but
that
free
choice
is
us
one
o
so
sly
are
clerkes
old
that
i
whose
opinion
i
may
hold
not
for
some
men
say
if
god
sees
all
beforn
godde
may
not
deceived
be
pardie
then
must
it
fallen
though
men
had
it
sworn
happen
that
purveyance
hath
seen
before
to
be
wherefore
i
say
that
from
if
he
hath
before
our
thought
eke
as
our
deed
we
have
no
free
choice
as
these
clerkes
read
for
other
thought
nor
other
deed
also
might
never
be
but
such
as
purveyance
which
may
not
be
deceived
never
mo
hath
before
without
ignorance
for
if
there
mighte
be
a
variance
to
writhen
out
from
godde
purveying
there
were
no
prescience
of
thing
coming
but
it
were
rather
an
opinion
uncertain
and
no
steadfast
foreseeing
and
certes
that
were
an
abusion
that
god
should
have
no
perfect
clear
weeting
more
than
we
men
that
have
weening
but
such
an
error
god
to
guess
impute
to
were
false
and
foul
and
wicked
cursedness
eke
this
is
an
opinion
of
some
that
have
their
top
full
high
and
smooth
they
say
right
thus
that
thing
is
not
to
come
that
the
prescience
hath
seen
before
that
it
shall
come
but
they
say
that
therefore
that
it
shall
come
therefore
the
purveyance
wot
it
before
withouten
ignorance
and
in
this
manner
this
necessity
in
his
part
contrary
again
in
the
opposite
for
needfully
behoves
it
not
to
be
that
thilke
thinges
in
certain
that
be
purvey
but
needly
as
they
sayn
behoveth
it
that
thinges
which
that
fall
that
they
in
certain
be
purveyed
all
i
mean
as
though
i
labour
me
in
this
to
inquire
which
thing
cause
of
which
thing
be
as
whether
that
the
prescience
of
god
is
the
certain
cause
of
the
necessity
of
thinges
that
to
come
be
pardie
or
if
necessity
of
thing
coming
be
cause
certain
of
the
purveying
but
now
i
me
in
shewing
do
not
lay
how
of
causes
stands
but
well
wot
i
that
it
behoveth
that
the
befalling
of
thinges
before
certainly
be
necessary
seem
it
thereby
it
does
not
that
prescience
put
falling
necessair
to
thing
to
come
all
fall
it
foul
or
fair
for
if
there
sit
a
man
yond
on
a
see
then
by
necessity
behoveth
it
that
certes
thine
opinion
sooth
be
that
weenest
or
conjectest
that
he
sit
and
furtherover
now
againward
yet
lo
right
so
is
it
on
the
part
contrary
as
thus
now
hearken
for
i
will
not
tarry
i
say
that
if
of
thee
be
sooth
for
that
he
sits
then
say
i
this
that
he
must
sitte
by
necessity
and
thus
necessity
in
either
is
for
in
him
need
of
sitting
is
and
in
thee
need
of
sooth
and
thus
forsooth
there
must
necessity
be
in
you
both
but
thou
say
he
sits
not
therefore
that
thine
opinion
of
his
sitting
sooth
but
rather
for
the
man
sat
there
before
therefore
is
thine
opinion
sooth
and
i
say
though
the
cause
of
sooth
of
this
comes
of
his
sitting
yet
necessity
is
interchanged
both
in
him
and
thee
thus
in
the
same
wise
out
of
doubtance
i
may
well
maken
as
it
seemeth
me
my
reasoning
of
godde
purveyance
and
of
the
thinges
that
to
come
be
by
whiche
reason
men
may
well
that
thinges
that
in
earthe
fall
that
by
necessity
they
comen
all
for
although
that
a
thing
should
come
therefore
it
is
purveyed
certainly
not
that
it
comes
for
it
purveyed
is
yet
natheless
behoveth
needfully
that
thing
to
come
be
purvey
truely
or
elles
thinges
that
purveyed
be
that
they
by
necessity
and
this
sufficeth
right
enough
certain
for
to
destroy
our
free
choice
deal
but
now
is
this
abusion
to
sayn
that
falling
of
the
thinges
temporel
is
cause
of
godde
prescience
eternel
now
truely
that
is
a
false
sentence
judgment
that
thing
to
come
should
cause
his
prescience
what
might
i
ween
i
had
such
a
thought
but
that
god
purveys
thing
that
is
to
come
for
that
it
is
to
come
and
elles
nought
so
might
i
ween
that
thinges
all
and
some
that
be
befall
and
overcome
happened
be
cause
of
thilke
purveyance
in
times
that
foreknows
all
withouten
ignorance
and
over
all
this
yet
say
i
more
thereto
that
right
as
when
i
wot
there
is
a
thing
that
thing
must
needfully
be
so
eke
right
so
when
i
wot
a
thing
coming
so
must
it
come
and
thus
the
befalling
of
thinges
that
be
wist
before
the
tide
they
may
not
be
on
any
side
while
troilus
was
in
all
this
heaviness
disputing
with
himself
in
this
matter
pandarus
joined
him
and
told
him
the
result
of
the
interview
with
cressida
and
at
night
the
lovers
met
with
what
sighs
and
tears
may
be
imagined
cressida
swooned
away
so
that
troilus
took
her
for
dead
and
having
tenderly
laid
out
her
limbs
as
one
preparing
a
corpse
for
the
bier
he
drew
his
sword
to
slay
himself
upon
her
body
but
as
god
would
just
at
that
moment
she
awoke
out
of
her
swoon
and
by
and
by
the
pair
began
to
talk
of
their
prospects
cressida
declared
the
opinion
supporting
it
at
great
length
and
with
many
reasons
that
there
was
no
cause
for
half
so
much
woe
on
either
part
her
surrender
decreed
by
the
parliament
could
not
be
resisted
it
was
quite
easy
for
them
soon
to
meet
again
she
would
bring
things
about
that
she
should
be
back
in
troy
within
a
week
or
two
she
would
take
advantage
of
the
constant
coming
and
going
while
the
truce
lasted
and
the
issue
would
be
that
the
trojans
would
have
both
her
and
antenor
while
to
facilitate
her
return
she
had
devised
a
stratagem
by
which
working
on
her
father
avarice
she
might
tempt
him
to
desert
from
the
greek
camp
back
to
the
city
and
truly
says
the
poet
having
fully
reported
her
plausible
speech
and
truely
as
written
well
i
find
that
all
this
thing
was
said
good
intent
and
that
her
hearte
true
was
and
kind
towardes
him
and
spake
right
as
she
meant
and
that
she
for
woe
nigh
when
she
went
and
was
in
purpose
ever
to
be
true
thus
write
they
that
of
her
workes
knew
this
troilus
with
heart
and
ears
open
heard
all
this
thing
devised
to
and
fro
and
verily
it
seemed
that
he
had
selfe
wit
but
yet
to
let
her
go
same
his
hearte
him
evermo
but
finally
he
gan
his
hearte
to
truste
her
and
took
it
for
the
best
for
which
the
great
fury
of
his
was
quench
with
hope
and
therewith
them
between
began
for
joy
the
amorouse
dance
and
as
the
birdes
when
the
sun
is
sheen
delighten
in
their
song
in
leaves
green
right
so
the
wordes
that
they
spake
delighten
them
and
make
their
heartes
cheer
yet
troilus
was
not
so
well
at
ease
that
he
did
not
earnestly
entreat
cressida
to
observe
her
promise
for
if
she
came
not
into
troy
at
the
set
day
he
should
never
have
health
honour
or
joy
and
he
feared
that
the
stratagem
by
which
she
would
try
to
lure
her
father
back
would
fail
so
that
she
might
be
compelled
to
remain
among
the
greeks
he
would
rather
have
them
steal
away
together
with
sufficient
treasure
to
maintain
them
all
their
lives
and
even
if
they
went
in
their
bare
shirt
he
had
kin
and
friends
elsewhere
who
would
welcome
and
honour
them
cressida
with
a
sigh
right
in
this
wise
answer
my
deare
hearte
true
we
may
well
steal
away
as
ye
devise
and
finde
such
unthrifty
wayes
new
but
afterward
full
sore
will
us
rue
will
regret
and
help
me
god
so
at
my
moste
need
as
causeless
ye
suffer
all
this
dread
for
day
that
i
for
cherishing
same
or
dread
of
father
or
of
other
wight
or
for
estate
delight
or
for
wedding
be
false
to
you
my
troilus
my
knight
saturne
daughter
juno
through
her
might
as
as
athamante
do
me
dwell
eternally
in
styx
the
pit
of
hell
and
this
on
god
celestial
i
swear
it
you
and
eke
on
each
goddess
on
nymph
and
deity
infernal
on
satyrs
and
on
faunes
more
or
less
that
be
of
wilderness
and
atropos
my
thread
of

utterly
if
i
be
false
now
me
if
you
lest
and
thou
simois
that
as
an

clear
through

ay

bear

word
that
said
is
here
that
thilke
day
that
i
untrue

to
troilus
mine
owen
hearte
free
that
thou
returne
backward
to
thy
well
and
i
with
body
and
soul
sink
in
hell
even
yet
troilus
was
not
wholly
content
and
urged
anew
his
plan
of
secret
flight
but
cressida
turned
upon
him
with
the
charge
that
he
mistrusted
her
causelessly
and
demanded
of
him
that
he
should
be
faithful
in
her
absence
else
she
must
die
at
her
return
troilus
promised
faithfulness
in
far
simpler
and
briefer
words
than
cressida
had
used
grand
mercy
good
heart
mine
quoth
she
and
blissful
venus
let
me
never
sterve
ere
i
may
stand
pleasance
in

in
a
position
to
reward
to
quite
that
so
well
can
deserve
him
well
with
and
while
that
god
my
wit
will
me
conserve
i
shall
so
do
so
true
i
have
you
found

so
that
it
may
your

mine
suffice
and
fare
now
well
for
time
is
that
ye
rise
the
lovers
took
a
adieu
and
troilus
suffering
unimaginable
anguish
withoute
more
out
of
the
chamber
went
the
fifth
book
approache
gan
the
fatal
destiny
that
jovis
hath
in
disposition
and
to
you
angry
parcae
sisters
three
fates
committeth
to
do
execution
for
which
cressida
must
out
of
the
town
and
troilus
shall
dwelle
forth
in
pine
till
lachesis
his
thread
no
longer
twine
the
phoebus
high
aloft
had
alle
with
his
beames
clear
the
snowes
molt
and
zephyrus
as
oft
again
the
tender
leaves
green
since
that
son
of
hecuba
the
began
to
love
her
first
for
whom
his
sorrow
was
all
that
she
depart
should
on
the
morrow
in
the
morning
diomede
was
ready
to
escort
cressida
to
the
greek
host
and
troilus
seeing
him
mount
his
horse
could
with
difficulty
resist
an
impulse
to
slay
him
but
restrained
himself
lest
his
lady
should
be
also
slain
in
the
tumult
when
cressida
was
ready
to
go
this
troilus
in
guise
of
courtesy
with
hawk
on
hand
and
with
a
huge
crowd
of
knightes
rode
and
did
her
company
passing
alle
the
valley
far
without
and
farther
would
have
ridden
out
of
doubt
full
fain
and
woe
was
him
to
go
so
soon
but
turn
he
must
and
it
was
eke
to
and
right
with
that
was
antenor
out
of
the
greekes
host
and
wight
was
of
it
glad
and
said
he
was
welcome
and
troilus
his
hearte
light
his
heart
he
pained
him
with
all
his
fulle
might
was
not
him
to
withhold
from
weeping
at
the
least
and
antenor
he
kiss
and
made
feast
and
therewithal
he
must
his
leave
take
and
cast
his
eye
upon
her
piteously
and
near
he
rode
his
for
to
make
occasion
to
take
her
by
the
hand
all
soberly
and
lord
so
she
gan
weepe
tenderly
and
he
full
soft
and
slily
gan
her
say
now
hold
your
day
and
me
not
to
dey
not
make
me
with
that
his
courser
turned
he
about
with
face
pale
and
unto
diomede
no
word
he
spake
nor
none
of
all
his
rout
of
which
the
son
of
tydeus
tooke
heed
as
he
that
more
than
the
creed
in
such
a
craft
and
by
the
rein
her
hent
and
troilus
to
troye
homeward
went
this
diomede
that
led
her
by
the
bridle
when
that
he
saw
the
folk
of
troy
away
thought
all
my
labour
shall
not
be
idle
if
that
i
may
for
somewhat
shall
i
say
for
at
the
worst
it
may
yet
short
our
way
i
have
heard
say
eke
times
twice
twelve
he
is
a
fool
that
will
forget
himselve
but
natheless
this
thought
he
well
enough
that
certainly
i
am
aboute
naught
if
that
i
speak
of
love
or
it
tough
any
violent
for
doubteless
if
she
have
in
her
thought
immediate
him
that
i
guess
he
may
not
be
so
soon
away
but
i
shall
find
a
mean
that
she
wit
as
yet
what
i
mean
not
yet
so
he
began
a
general
conversation
assured
her
of
not
less
friendship
and
honour
among
the
greeks
than
she
had
enjoyed
in
troy
and
requested
of
her
earnestly
to
treat
him
as
a
brother
and
accept
his
service
for
at
last
he
said
i
am
and
shall
be
ay
while
that
my
life
may
dure
your
own
aboven
creature
thus
said
i
never
now
to
woman
born
for
god
mine
heart
as
gladden
so
i
loved
never
woman
herebeforn
as
paramours
nor
ever
shall
no
mo
and
for
the
love
of
god
be
not
my
foe
can
i
not
to
you
my
lady
dear
complain
aright
for
i
am
yet
to
lear
and
wonder
not
mine
owen
lady
bright
though
that
i
speak
of
love
to
you
thus
blive
for
i
have
heard
ere
this
of
many
a
wight
that
loved
thing
he
saw
in
his
live
eke
i
am
not
of
power
for
to
strive
against
the
god
of
love
but
him
obey
i
will
alway
and
mercy
i
you
pray
cressida
answered
his
discourses
as
though
she
scarcely
heard
them
yet
she
thanked
him
for
his
trouble
and
courtesy
and
accepted
his
offered
friendship
promising
to
trust
him
as
well
she
might
then
she
alighted
from
her
steed
and
with
her
heart
nigh
breaking
was
welcomed
to
the
embrace
of
her
father
meanwhile
troilus
back
in
troy
was
lamenting
with
tears
the
loss
of
his
love
despairing
of
his
or
her
ability
to
survive
the
ten
days
and
spending
the
night
in
wailing
sleepless
tossing
and
troublous
dreams
in
the
morning
he
was
visited
by
pandarus
to
whom
he
gave
directions
for
his
funeral
desiring
that
the
powder
into
which
his
heart
was
burned
should
be
kept
in
a
golden
urn
and
given
to
cressida
pandarus
renewed
his
old
counsels
and
consolations
reminded
his
friend
that
ten
days
were
a
short
time
to
wait
argued
against
his
faith
in
evil
dreams
and
urged
him
to
take
advantage
of
the
truce
and
beguile
the
time
by
a
visit
to
king
sarpedon
a
lycian
prince
who
had
come
to
aid
the
trojans
sarpedon
entertained
them
splendidly
but
no
feasting
no
pomp
no
music
of
instruments
no
singing
of
fair
ladies
could
make
up
for
the
absence
of
cressida
to
the
desolate
troilus
who
was
for
ever
poring
upon
her
old
letters
and
recalling
her
loved
form
thus
he
drove
to
an
end
the
fourth
day
and
would
have
then
returned
to
troy
but
for
the
remonstrances
of
pandarus
who
asked
if
they
had
visited
sarpedon
only
to
fetch
fire
at
last
at
the
end
of
a
week
they
returned
to
troy
troilus
hoping
to
find
cressida
again
in
the
city
pandarus
entertaining
a
scepticism
which
he
concealed
from
his
friend
the
morning
after
their
return
troilus
was
impatient
till
he
had
gone
to
the
palace
of
cressida
but
when
he
found
her
doors
all
closed
well
nigh
for
sorrow
adown
he
gan
to
fall
therewith
when
he
was
ware
and
gan
behold
how
shut
was
window
of
the
place
as
frost
him
thought
his
hearte
to
cold
to
grow
for
which
with
changed
deadly
pale
face
withoute
word
he
forth
began
to
pace
and
as
god
would
he
gan
so
faste
ride
that
no
wight
of
his
countenance
espied
then
said
he
thus
o
palace
desolate
o
house
of
houses
beste
hight
called
o
palace
empty
and
disconsolate
o
thou
lantern
of
which
quench

the
light

that
now

and
farewell
shrine
of
which
the

out
from
thence
forth
he
rideth
up
and
down
and
thing
came
him
to
remembrance
as
he
rode
by
the
places
of
the
town
in
which
he
whilom
had
all
his
pleasance
lo
yonder
saw
i
mine
own
lady
dance
and
in
that
temple
with
her
eyen
clear

caughte
first
my
righte
lady
dear
and
yonder
have
i
heard
full
lustily

and
yonder
play
saw
i
her

eke
full
blissfully
and
yonder

i
pray
and
yond
so
gladly
gan
she
me
behold
that
to
the
death
my
heart
is
to
her
hold
bound
and
at
that
corner
in
the
yonder
house
heard
i
mine
lady
dear
of
all
so
womanly
with
voice
melodious
singe
so
well
so
goodly
and
so
clear
that
in
my
soule
yet
me
thinks
i
hear
the
blissful
sound
and
in
that
yonder
place
my
lady
first
me
took
unto
her
grace
then
he
went
to
the
gates
and
gazed
along
the
way
by
which
he
had
attended
cressida
at
her
departure
then
he
fancied
that
all
the
pitied
him
and
thus
he
drove
forth
a
day
or
two
more
singing
a
song
of
few
words
which
he
had
made
to
lighten
his
heart
o
star
of
which
i
lost
have
all
the
light
with
hearte
sore
well
ought
i
to
bewail
that
ever
dark
in
torment
night
by
night
toward
my
death
with
wind
i
steer
and
sail
for
which
the
tenthe
night
if
that
i
be
left
without
the
guiding
of
thy
beames
bright
an
hour
my
ship
and
me
charybdis
will
devour
by
night
he
prayed
the
moon
to
run
fast
about
her
sphere
by
day
he
reproached
the
tardy
sun
dreading
that
phaethon
had
come
to
life
again
and
was
driving
the
chariot
of
apollo
out
of
its
straight
course
meanwhile
cressida
among
the
greeks
was
bewailing
the
refusal
of
her
father
to
let
her
return
the
certainty
that
her
lover
would
think
her
false
and
the
hopelessness
of
any
attempt
to
steal
away
by
night
her
bright
face
waxed
pale
her
limbs
lean
as
she
stood
all
day
looking
toward
troy
thinking
on
her
love
and
all
her
past
delights
regretting
that
she
had
not
followed
the
counsel
of
troilus
to
steal
away
with
him
and
finally
vowing
that
she
would
at
all
hazards
return
to
the
city
but
she
was
fated
ere
two
months
to
be
full
far
from
any
such
intention
for
diomede
now
brought
all
his
skill
into
play
to
entice
cressida
into
his
net
on
the
tenth
day
diomede
as
fresh
as
branch
in
may
came
to
the
tent
of
cressida
feigning
business
with
calchas
cresside
at
shorte
wordes
for
to
tell
welcomed
him
and
down
by
her
him
set
and
he
was
enough
to
make
dwell
persuaded
to
and
after
this
withoute
longe
let
the
spices
and
the
wine
men
forth
him
fet
and
forth
they
speak
of
this
and
that
as
friendes
do
of
which
some
shall
ye
hear
he
gan
first
fallen
of
the
war
in
speech
between
them
and
the
folk
of
troye
town
and
of
the
siege
he
gan
eke
her
beseech
to
tell
him
what
was
her
opinioun
from
that
demand
he
so
descended
down
to
aske
her
if
that
her
strange
thought
the
greekes
guise
and
workes
that
they
wrought
and
why
her
father
so
long
to
wedde
her
unto
some
worthy
wight
cressida
that
was
in
her
paines
strong
for
love
of
troilus
her
owen
knight
so
farforth
as
she
had
or
might
answer
him
then
but
as
for
his
intent
it
seemed
not
she
what
he
meant
but
natheless
this
diomede
gan
himself
assure
and
thus
he
said
if
i
aright
have
on
you
heed
me
thinketh
thus
o
lady
mine
cresside
that
since
i
first
hand
on
your
bridle
laid
when
ye
out
came
of
troye
by
the
morrow
ne
might
i
never
see
you
but
in
sorrow
i
can
not
say
what
may
the
cause
be
but
if
for
love
of
some
trojan
it
were
which
right
sore
would
it
would
much
that
ye
for
any
wight
that
dwelleth
there
pain
me
to
should
ever
a
quarter
of
a
tear
or
piteously
yourselfe
so
beguile
for
it
is
not
worth
the
while
the
folk
of
troy
as
who
saith
all
and
some
in
prison
be
as
ye
yourselfe
see
from
thence
shall
not
one
alive
come
for
all
the
gold
betwixte
sun
and
sea
truste
this
well
and
understande
me
there
shall
not
one
to
mercy
go
alive
were
he
lord
of
worldes
twice
five
what
will
ye
more
lovesome
lady
dear
let
troy
and
trojan
from
your
hearte
pace
drive
out
that
bitter
hope
and
make
good
cheer
and
call
again
the
beauty
of
your
face
that
ye
with
salte
teares
so
deface
for
troy
is
brought
into
such
jeopardy
that
it
to
save
is
now
no
remedy
and
thinke
well
ye
shall
in
greekes
find
a
love
more
perfect
ere
that
it
be
night
than
any
trojan
is
and
more
kind
and
better
you
to
serve
will
do
his
might
and
if
ye
vouchesafe
my
lady
bright
i
will
be
he
to
serve
you
myselve
yea
than
be
a
lord
of
greekes
twelve
and
with
that
word
he
gan
to
waxe
red
and
in
his
speech
a
little
while
he
quoke
trembled
and
cast
aside
a
little
with
his
head
and
stint
a
while
and
afterward
he
woke
and
soberly
on
her
he
threw
his
look
and
said
i
am
albeit
to
you
no
joy
as
man
as
any
wight
in
troy
but
hearte
mine
since
that
i
am
your
man
subject
and
you
be
the
first
of
whom
i
seeke
grace
in
love
to
serve
you
as
heartily
as
i
can
and
ever
shall
while
i
to
live
have
space
so
ere
that
i
depart
out
of
this
place
ye
will
me
grante
that
i
may
at
better
leisure
telle
you
my
sorrow
why
should
i
tell
his
wordes
that
he
said
he
spake
enough
for
one
day
at
the
mest
it
proveth
well
he
spake
so
that
cresseide
granted
upon
the
morrow
at
his
request
farther
to
speake
with
him
at
the
least
so
that
he
would
not
speak
of
such
mattere
and
thus
she
said
to
him
as
ye
may
hear
as
she
that
had
her
heart
on
troilus
so
faste
set
that
none
might
it
arace
and
she
spake
and
saide
thus
unfriendlily
o
diomede
i
love
that
ilke
place
where
i
was
born
and
jovis
for
his
grace
deliver
it
soon
of
all
that
doth
it
care
god
for
thy
might
so
well
to
fare
she
knows
that
the
greeks
would
fain
wreak
their
wrath
on
troy
if
they
might
but
that
shall
never
befall
she
knows
that
there
are
greeks
of
high
condition
though
as
worthy
men
would
be
found
in
troy
and
she
knows
that
diomede
could
serve
his
lady
well
but
as
to
speak
of
love
she
said
i
had
a
lord
to
whom
i
wedded
was
he
whose
mine
heart
was
all
until
he
died
and
other
love
as
help
me
now
pallas
there
in
my
heart
nor
is
nor
ever
was
and
that
ye
be
of
noble
and
high
kindred
i
have
well
heard
it
tellen
out
of
dread
and
that
me
to
have
so
great
a
wonder
that
ye
will
scornen
any
woman
so
eke
god
wot
love
and
i
be
far
asunder
i
am
disposed
bet
so
may
i
go
or
prosper
unto
my
death
to
plain
and
make
woe
what
i
shall
after
do
i
can
not
say
but
truely
as
yet
list
not
play
am
not
disposed
sport
mine
heart
is
now
in
tribulatioun
and
ye
in
armes
busy
be
by
day
hereafter
when
ye
wonnen
have
the
town
then
so
as
it
happen
may
that
when
i
see
that
i
never
sey
then
will
i
work
that
i
never
ere
wrought
this
word
to
you
enough
sufficen
ought
eke
will
i
speak
with
you
fain
so
that
ye
touche
naught
of
this
mattere
and
when
you
list
ye
may
come
here
again
and
ere
ye
go
thus
much
i
say
you
here
as
help
me
pallas
with
her
haires
clear
if
that
i
should
of
any
greek
have
ruth
it
shoulde
be
yourselfe
by
my
truth
i
say
not
therefore
that
i
will
you
love
say
not
nay
but
in
conclusioun
say
i
that
i
meane
well
by
god
that
sits
above
i
will
and
therewithal
she
cast
her
eyen
down
and
gan
to
sigh
and
said
o
troye
town
yet
i
god
in
quiet
and
in
rest
i
may
you
see
or
my
hearte
brest
my
heart
to
but
in
effect
and
shortly
for
to
say
this
diomede
all
freshly
new
again
gan
pressen
on
and
fast
her
mercy
pray
and
after
this
the
soothe
for
to
sayn
her
glove
he
took
of
which
he
was
full
fain
and
finally
when
it
was
waxen
eve
and
all
was
well
he
rose
and
took
his
leave
cressida
retired
to
rest
returning
in
her
soul
ay
up
and
down
the
wordes
of
this
sudden
diomede
his
great
estate
the
peril
of
the
town
and
that
she
was
alone
and
hadde
need
of
friendes
help
and
thus
began
to
dread
the
causes
why
the
soothe
for
to
tell
that
she
took
fully
the
purpose
for
to
dwell
with
the
greeks
the
morrow
came
and
for
to
speak
this
diomede
is
come
unto
cresseide
and
shortly
lest
that
ye
my
tale
break
so
well
he
for
himselfe
spake
and
said
that
all
her
sighes
sore
adown
he
laid
and
finally
the
soothe
for
to
sayn
he
her
the
of
all
her
pain
away
greater
part
of
and
after
this
the
story
telleth
us
that
she
him
gave
the
faire
baye
steed
the
which
she
ones
won
of
troilus
and
eke
a
brooch
and
that
was
little
need
that
troilus
was
she
gave
this
diomede
and
eke
the
bet
from
sorrow
him
to
relieve
she
made
him
wear
a
of
her
sleeve
i
find
eke
in
the
story
elleswhere
when
through
the
body
hurt
was
diomede
by
troilus
she
wept
many
a
tear
when
that
she
saw
his
wide
woundes
bleed
and
that
she
took
to
him
good
heed
care
for
and
for
to
heal
him
of
his
sorrow
smart
men
say
i
that
she
gave
him
her
heart
not
and
yet
when
pity
had
thus
completed
the
triumph
of
inconstancy
she
made
bitter
moan
over
her
falseness
to
one
of
the
noblest
and
worthiest
men
that
ever
was
but
it
was
now
too
late
to
repent
and
at
all
events
she
resolved
that
she
would
be
true
to
diomede
all
the
while
weeping
for
pity
of
the
absent
troilus
to
whom
she
wished
every
happiness
the
tenth
day
meantime
had
barely
dawned
when
troilus
accompanied
by
pandarus
took
his
stand
on
the
walls
to
watch
for
the
return
of
cressida
till
noon
they
stood
thinking
that
every
corner
from
afar
was
she
then
troilus
said
that
doubtless
her
old
father
bore
the
parting
ill
and
had
detained
her
till
after
dinner
so
they
went
to
dine
and
returned
to
their
vain
observation
on
the
walls
troilus
invented
all
kinds
of
explanations
for
his
mistress
delay
now
her
father
would
not
let
her
go
till
eve
now
she
would
ride
quietly
into
the
town
after
nightfall
not
to
be
observed
now
he
must
have
mistaken
the
day
for
five
or
six
days
he
watched
still
in
vain
and
with
decreasing
hope
gradually
his
strength
decayed
until
he
could
walk
only
with
a
staff
answering
the
wondering
inquiries
of
his
friends
by
saying
that
he
had
a
grievous
malady
about
his
heart
one
day
he
dreamed
that
in
a
forest
he
saw
cressida
in
the
embrace
of
a
boar
and
he
had
no
longer
doubt
of
her
falsehood
pandarus
however
explained
away
the
dream
to
mean
merely
that
cressida
was
detained
by
her
father
who
might
be
at
the
point
of
death
and
he
counselled
the
disconsolate
lover
to
write
a
letter
by
which
he
might
perhaps
get
at
the
truth
troilus
complied
entreating
from
his
mistress
at
the
least
a
letter
of
hope
and
the
lady
answered
that
she
could
not
come
now
but
would
so
soon
as
she
might
at
the
same
time
making
him
great
feast
and
swearing
that
she
loved
him
best
of
which
he
found
but
bottomless
behest
which
he
found
but
groundless
promises
day
by
day
increased
the
woe
of
troilus
he
laid
himself
in
bed
neither
eating
nor
drinking
nor
sleeping
nor
speaking
almost
distracted
by
the
thought
of
unkindness
he
related
his
dream
to
his
sister
cassandra
who
told
him
that
the
boar
betokened
diomede
and
that
wheresoever
his
lady
was
diornede
certainly
had
her
heart
and
she
was
his
weep
if
thou
wilt
or
leave
for
out
of
doubt
this
diomede
is
in
and
thou
art
out
troilus
enraged
refused
to
believe
cassandra
interpretation
as
well
he
cried
might
such
a
story
be
credited
of
alcestis
who
devoted
her
life
for
her
husband
and
in
his
wrath
he
started
from
bed
as
though
all
whole
had
him
a
leach
physician
resolving
to
find
out
the
truth
at
all
hazards
the
death
of
hector
meanwhile
enhanced
the
sorrow
which
he
endured
but
he
found
time
to
write
often
to
cressida
beseeching
her
to
come
again
and
hold
her
truth
till
one
day
his
false
mistress
out
of
pity
wrote
him
again
in
these
terms
cupide
son
ensample
of
goodlihead
excellence
o
sword
of
knighthood
source
of
gentleness

might

troilus
could
not
believe
his
lady
so
cruel
as
to
forsake
him
but
he
was
put
out
of
all
doubt
one
day
that
as
he
stood
in

and
melancholy
he
saw
a
armour
borne
along
the
street
in
token
of
victory
before
deiphobus
his
brother
deiphobus
had
won
it
from
diomede
in
battle
that
day
and
troilus
examining
it
out
of
curiosity
found
within
the
collar
a
brooch
which
he
had
given
to
cressida
on
the
morning
she
left

which
she
had
pledged
her

to
keep
for
ever

of

of

troilus
wrought
havoc
among
the
greeks
and
often
he
exchanged
blows
and
bitter
words
with
diomede
whom
he
always
specially
sought
but
it
was
not
their
lot
that
either
should
fall
by
the

the
purpose
however
he
tells
us
is
to
relate
not
the
warlike

of

says
that
this

devised

seemeth
to

a

report
of
the
marriage
of
john

the
king

then
a

that

immediately
followed

no
consequence
need
be
attached
to
that
statement
enough
that
it
followed
at
no
great
interval
of
time
and
that
the
intimate
relations
which
chaucer
had
already
begun
to
form
with
john
of
gaunt
might
well
warrant
him
in
writing
this
poem
on
the
occasion
of
the

in
weaving
his
own
with

of

figures

note
modern

believe
that
chaucer
was
not
the
author
of
this
poem
when
flora
the
queen
of
pleasance
had
wholly
the
the
of
the
fresh
and
the
new
season
thorough
region
and
with
her
mantle
what
winter
had
discovert
on
a
may
night
the
poet
lay
alone
thinking
of
his
lady
and
all
her
beauty
and
falling
asleep
he
dreamed
that
he
was
in
an
island
where
wall
and
gate
was
all
of
glass
and
so
was
closed
round
about
that
none
came
in
nor
out
permission
uncouth
and
strange
to
behold
for
gate
of
fine
gold
a
thousand
fanes
ay
turning
weathercocks
had
and
birds
singing
so
as
to
emit
diversely
on
each
fane
a
pair
a
musical
sound
with
open
mouth
against
the
air
and
a
were
all
the
the

of
uncouth
colours
ay
that
never
be
none
seen
in
may
with
many
a
small
turret
high
but
man
alive
i
could
not
sigh
nor
creatures
save
ladies
play
themselves
which
were
such
of
their
array
that
as
me
thought
they
passed
all
and
womanhead
for
to
behold
them
dance
and
sing
it
seemed
like
none
earthly
thing
and
all
were
of
the
same
age
save
one
who
was
advanced
in
years
though
no
less
gay
in
demeanour
than
the
rest
while
he
stood
admiring
the
richness
and
beauty
of
the
place
and
the
fairness
of
the
ladies
which
had
the
notable
gift
of
enduring
unimpaired
till
death
the
poet
was
accosted
by
the
old
lady
to
whom
he
had
to
yield
himself
prisoner
because
the
ordinance
of
the
isle
was
that
no
man
should
dwell
there
and
the
ladies
fear
of
breaking
the
law
was
enhanced
by
the
temporary
absence
of
their
queen
from
the
realm
just
at
this
moment
the
cry
was
raised
that
the
queen
came
all
the
ladies
hastened
to
meet
her
and
soon
the
poet
saw
her
approach
but
in
her
company
his
mistress
wearing
the
same
garb
and
a
seemly
knight
all
the
ladies
wondered
greatly
at
this
and
the
queen
explained
my
sisters
how
it
hath
befall
i
trow
ye
know
it
one
and
all
that
of
long
time
here
have
i
been

while

apples
three
i
have
not
fail
against
the
day
thitherward
to
take
the
way
to
as
i
had
oft
to
but
when
i
came
i
found
aloft
my
sister
which
that
hero
stands
having
those
apples
in
her
hands
them
and
nothing
said
gazing
on
but
look
as
she
were
apaid
and
as
i
stood
her
to
behold
thinking
how
my
joys
were
cold
since
i
these
apples
not
might
not
even
with
that
so
came
this
knight
and
in
his
arms
of
me
unware
me
took
and
to
his
ship
me
bare
and
said
though
him
i
had
seen
yet
had
i
long
his
lady
been
wherefore
i
shoulde
with
him
wend
and
he
would
to
his
life
end
my
servant
be
and
gan
to
sing
as
one
that
had
won
a
rich
thing
then
were
my
spirits
from
me
gone
so
suddenly
every
one
that
in
me
appear
but
death
for
i
felt
neither
life
nor
breath
nor
good
nor
harme
none
i
knew
the
sudden
pain
me
was
so
new
that
not
the
hasty
grace
it
not
been
for
the
of
this
lady
that
from
the
tree
prompt
of
her
gentleness
so
bled
me
to
comforten
i
had
died
and
of
her
three
apples
she
one
into
mine
hand
there
put
anon
which
brought
again
my
mind
and
breath
and
me
recover
from
the
death
wherefore
to
her
so
am
i
hold
obliged
that
for
her
all
things
do
i
for
she
was
of
all
my
smart
and
from
great
pain
so
my
heart
and
as
god
wot
right
as
ye
hear
me
to
comfort
with
friendly
cheer
she
did
her
prowess
and
her
might
and
truly
eke
so
did
this
knight
in
that
he
could
and
often
said
that
of
my
woe
he
was
paid
and
curs
the
ship
that
him
there
brought
the
mast
the
master
that
it
wrought
and
as
each
thing
must
have
an
end
my
sister
here
our
bother
friend
gan
with
her
words
so
womanly
this
knight
entreat
and
cunningly
for
mine
honour
and
hers
also
and
said
that
with
her
we
should
go
both
in
her
ship
where
she
was
brought
which
was
so
wonderfully
wrought
so
clean
so
rich
and
so
array
that
we
were
both
content
and
paid
and
me
to
comfort
and
to
please
and
my
heart
for
to
put
at
ease
she
took
great
pain
in
little
while
and
thus
hath
brought
us
to
this
isle
as
ye
may
see
wherefore
each
one
i
pray
you
thank
her
one
and
one
as
heartily
as
ye
can
devise
or
imagine
in
any
wise
at
once
there
then
men
mighte
a
world
of
ladies
fall
on
kneen
before
my
lady
thanking
her
and
placing
themselves
at
her
commandment
then
the
queen
sent
the
aged
lady
to
the
knight
to
learn
of
him
why
he
had
done
her
all
this
woe
and
when
the
messenger
had
discharged
her
mission
telling
the
knight
that
in
the
general
opinion
he
had
done
amiss
he
fell
down
suddenly
as
if
dead
for
sorrow
and
repentance
only
with
great
difficulty
by
the
queen
herself
was
he
restored
to
consciousness
and
comfort
but
though
she
spoke
kind
and
words
her
heart
was
not
in
her
speech
for
her
intent
was
to
his
barge
him
for
to
bring
against
the
eve
with

ladies
and
take
leave
and
pray
him
of
his
gentleness
to
thenceforth
in
peace
her
as
other
princes
had
before
and
from
thenceforth
for
evermore
she
would
him
worship
in

that

might
devise

wholly
to

her
utmost
in

his
pleasure

could
in
their
harmony
the
ladies
were
alarmed
and
at
sight
of
the
ships
thinking
that
the
knight
companions
were
on
board
and
they
went
towards
the
walls
of
the
isle
to
shut
the
gates
but
it
was
cupid
who
came
and
he
had
already
landed
and
marched
straight
to
the
place
where
the
knight
lay
then
he
chid
the
queen
for
her
unkindness
to
his
servant
shot
an
arrow
into
her
heart
and
passed
through
the
crowd
until
he
found
the
lady
whom
he
saluted
and
complimented
urging
her
to
have
pity
on
him
that
loved
her
while
the
poet
standing
apart
was
revolving
all
this
in
his
mind
and
resolving
truly
to
serve
his
lady
he
saw
the
queen
advance
to
cupid
with
a
petition
in
which
she
besought
forgiveness
of
past
offences
and
promised
continual
and
zealous
service
till
her
death
cupid
smiled
and
said
that
he
would
be
king
within
that
island
his
new
conquest
then
after
long
conference
with
the
queen
he
called
a
council
for
the
morrow
of
all
who
chose
to
wear
his
colours
in
the
morning
such
was
the
press
of
ladies
that
scarcely
could
be
found
in
all
the
plain
cupid
presided
and
one
of
his
counsellors
addressed
the
mighty
crowd
promising
that
ere
his
departure
his
lord
should
bring
to
an
agreement
all
the
parties
there
present
then
cupid
gave
to
the
knight
and
the
dreamer
each
his
lady
promised
his
favour
to
all
the
others
in
that
place
who
would
truly
and
busily
serve
in
love
and
at
evening
took
his
departure
next
morning
having
declined
the
proffered
sovereignty
of
the
island
the
poet
mistress
also
embarked
leaving
him
behind
but
he
dashed
through
the
waves
was
drawn
on
board
her
ship
from
peril
of
death
and
graciously
received
into
his
lady
lasting
favour
here
the
poet
awakes
finding
his
cheeks
and
body
all
wet
with
tears
and
removing
into
another
chamber
to
rest
more
in
peace
he
falls
asleep
anew
and
continues
the
dream
again
he
is
within
the
island
where
the
knight
and
all
the
ladies
are
assembled
on
a
green
and
it
is
resolved
by
the
assembly
not
only
that
the
knight
shall
be
their
king
but
that
every
lady
there
shall
be
wedded
also
it
is
determined
that
the
knight
shall
depart
that
very
day
and
return
within
ten
days
with
such
a
host
of
benedicts
that
none
in
the
isle
need
lack
husbands
the
knight
anon
into
a
little
barge
brought
was
late
against
an
eve
where
of
all
he
took
his
leave
which
barge
was
as
a
man
thought
his
pleasure
to
him
brought
the
queen
herself
accustom
ay
in
the
same
barge
to
play
her
sport
it
needed
neither
mast
nor
i
have
not
heard
of
such
another
nor
master
for
the
governance
it
sailed
by
thought
and
pleasance
withoute
labour
east
and
west
all
was
one
calm
or
tempest
and
i
went
with
at
his
request
and
was
the
first
pray
to
the
feast
bridal
feast
when
he
came
unto
his
country
and
passed
had
the
wavy
sea
in
a
haven
deep
and
large
he
left
his
rich
and
noble
barge
and
to
the
court
shortly
to
tell
he
went
where
he
was
wont
to
dwell
and
was
gladly
received
as
king
by
the
estates
of
the
land
for
during
his
absence
his
father
old
and
wise
and
hoar
had
died
commending
to
their
fidelity
his
absent
son
the
prince
related
to
the
estates
his
journey
and
his
success
in
finding
the
princess
in
quest
of
whom
he
had
gone
seven
years
before
and
said
that
he
must
have
sixty
thousand
guests
at
his
marriage
feast
the
lords
gladly
guaranteed
the
number
within
the
set
time
but
afterwards
they
found
that
fifteen
days
must
be
spent
in
the
necessary
preparations
between
shame
and
sorrow
the
prince
thus
compelled
to
break
his
faith
took
to
his
bed
and
in
wailing
and
endur
the
days
fifteen
till
that
the
lords
on
an
evene
him
came
and
told
they
ready
were
and
showed
in
few
wordes
there
how
and
what
wise
they
had
suitably
for
his
estate
and
to
him
said
to
his
that
twenty
thousand
knights
of
name
and
forty
thousand
without
blame
alle
come
of
noble
lineage
together
in
a
company
were
lodged
on
a
river
side
him
and
his
pleasure
there
the
prince
then
for
joy
uprose
and
where
they
lodged
were
he
goes
withoute
more
that
same
night
and
there
his
supper
to
dight
and
with
them
till
it
was
day
and
forthwith
to
take
his
journey
leaving
the
strait
holding
the
large
till
he
came
to
his
noble
barge
and
when
the
prince
this
lusty
knight
with
his
people
in
armes
bright
was
come
where
he
thought
to
pass
to
the
isle
and
knew
well
none
abiding
was
behind
but
all
were
there
present
forthwith
anon
all
his
intent
he
told
them
there
and
made
his
thorough
his
hoste
that
day
twice
commanding
living
wight
there
being
present
in
his
sight
to
be
the
morrow
on
the
rivage
there
he
begin
would
his
voyage
the
morrow
come
the
was
was
but
few
were
there
that
night
that
slept
but
and
for
the
morrow
up
and
for
of
ships
was
all
their
sorrow
shortage
for
save
the
barge
and
other
two
of
shippes
there
i
saw
no
mo
thus
in
their
doubtes
as
they
stood
waxing
the
sea
coming
the
flood
was
cried
to
ship
go
wight
then
was
but
that
hie
him
might
could
hasten
and
to
the
barge
me
thought
each
one
they
went
without
was
left
not
one
horse
nor
truss
nor
baggage
wallet
spear
gardebrace
nor
page
but
was
lodged
and
room
enough
at
which
shipping
me
thought
i
lough
and
gan
to
marvel
in
my
thought
how
ever
such
a
ship
was
wrought
for
people
that
can
increase
the
numbers
nor
so
thick
might
be
the
prease
crowd
but
alle
hadde
room
at
will
there
was
not
one
was
lodged
for
as
i
trow
myself
the
last
was
one
and
lodged
by
the
mast
and
where
i
look
i
saw
such
room
as
all
were
lodged
in
a
town
forth
went
the
ship
said
was
the
creed
and
on
their
knees
their
good
speed
pray
for
down
kneeled
wight
a
while
and
prayed
fast
that
to
the
isle
they
mighte
come
in
safety
the
prince
and
all
the
company
with
worship
and
withoute
blame
or
of
his
name
slander
of
the
promise
he
should
return
within
the
time
he
did
sojourn
in
his
lande
his
host
for
this
was
their
prayer
least
and
most
to
keep
the
day
it
might
not
that
he
appointed
with
the
queen
wherefore
the
prince
slept
neither
day
nor
night
till
he
and
his
people
landed
on
the
isle
weening
to
be
in
that
night
but
ere
they
had
gone
a
little
way
they
met
a
lady
all
in
black
with
piteous
countenance
who
reproached
the
prince
for
his
untruth
and
informed
him
that
unable
to
bear
the
reproach
to
their
name
caused
by
the
lightness
of
their
trust
in
strangers
the
queen
and
all
the
ladies
of
the
isle
had
vowed
neither
to
eat
nor
drink
nor
sleep
nor
speak
nor
cease
weeping
till
all
were
dead
the
queen
had
died
the
first
and
half
of
the
other
ladies
had
already
under
the
earth
lodging
new
the
woeful
recorder
of
all
these
woes
invites
the
prince
to
behold
the
queen
hearse
come
within
come
see
her
hearse
where
ye
shall
see
the
piteous
sight
that
ever
yet
was
shown
to
knight
for
ye
shall
see
ladies
stand
each
with
a
greate
rod
in
hand
clad
in
black
with
visage
white
ready
each
other
for
to
smite
if
any
be
that
will
not
weep
or
who
makes
countenance
to
sleep
they
be
so
beat
that
all
so
blue
they
be
as
cloth
that
dy
is
new
scarcely
has
the
lady
ceased
to
speak
when
the
prince
plucks
forth
a
dagger
plunges
it
into
his
heart
and
drawing
but
one
breath
expires
for
whiche
cause
the
lusty
host
which
stood
in
battle
on
the
coast
at
once
for
sorrow
such
a
cry
gan
rear
the
company
that
to
the
heard
was
the
soun
and
under
as
far
adown
and
wilde
beastes
for
the
fear
so
suddenly
were
that
for
the
doubt
while
they
might
dure
a
chance
of
safety
they
ran
as
of
their
lives
unsure
from
the
woodes
into
the
plain
and
from
valleys
the
high
mountain
they
sought
and
ran
as
beastes
blind
that
clean
forgotten
had
their
kind
the
lords
of
the
laggard
host
ask
the
woebegone
lady
what
should
be
done
she
answers
that
nothing
can
now
avail
but
that
for
remembrance
they
should
build
in
their
land
open
to
public
view
in
some
notable
old
city
a
chapel
engraved
with
some
memorial
of
the
queen
and
straightway
with
a
sigh
she
also
pass
her
breath
then
said
the
lordes
of
the
host
and
so
concluded
least
and
most
that
they
would
ay
in
houses
of
their
lives
lead
and
wear
but
black
and
forsake
all
their
pleasances
and
turn
all
joy
to
penances
and
bare
the
dead
prince
to
the
barge
and
named
have
the
charge
who
and
to
the
hearse
where
lay
the
queen
the
remnant
went
and
down
on
kneen
holding
their
hands
on
high
gan
cry
mercy
mercy
thry
one
and
curs
the
time
that
ever
sloth
should
have
such
masterdom
of
troth
and
to
the
barge
a
longe
mile
they
bare
her
forth
and
in
a
while
all
the
ladies
one
and
one
by
companies
were
brought
each
one
and
pass
the
sea
and
took
the
land
and
in
new
hearses
on
a
sand
put
and
brought
were
all
anon
unto
a
city
clos
with
stone
where
it
had
been
used

the
kinges
of
the
land
to

after
they
reigned
in
honours
and

and
said
was
the
service
of
the
prince
and
eke
of
the
queen
so
devoutly
as

and
after
that
about
the
hearses
many
orisons
and
verses
withoute
full
softely
said
were
and
that
full
heartily
that
all
the
night
till
it
was

the
people
in
the
church
gan
pray
unto
the
holy
trinity
of
those
soules
to

when
the
nighte
past
and

and
the
newe

with
rayes

and
fair

and
made
a
time
of
wholesome
air
befell
a
wondrous
and
strange
event
among
the
people
and
gan
change
soon
the
word
and
woe
unto
a
joy
and
some
to
two
a
bird
all
feather
blue
and
green
with
brighte
rays
like
gold
between
as
small
thread
over
joint
all
full
of
colour
strange
and
coint
and
wonderful
to
sight
upon
the
queene
hearse
gan
light
and
sung
full
low
and
softely
three
songes
in
their
harmony
every
wight
till
at
the
last
an
aged
knight
which
seem
a
man
in
greate
thought
like
as
he
set
all
thing
at
nought
with
visage
and
eyes
all
forwept
in
tears
and
pale
as
a
man
long
unslept
by
the
hearses
as
he
stood
with
hasty
handling
of
his
hood
unto
a
prince
that
by
him
past
made
the
bird
somewhat
aghast
wherefore
he
rose
and
left
his
song
and
departed
from
us
among
and
spread
his
winges
for
to
pass
by
the
place
where
he
enter
was
and
in
his
haste
shortly
to
tell
him
hurt
that
backward
down
he
fell
from
a
window
richly
paint
with
lives
of
many
a
divers
saint
and
beat
his
winges
and
bled
fast
and
of
the
hurt
thus
died
and
past
and
lay
there
well
an
hour
and
more
till
at
the
last
of
birds
a
score
came
and
assembled
at
the
place
where
the
window
broken
was
and
made
such
waimentatioun
that
pity
was
to
hear
the
soun
and
the
warbles
of
their
throats
and
the
complaint
of
their
notes
which
from
joy
clean
was
reversed
and
of
them
one
the
glass
soon
pierced
and
in
his
beak
of
colours
nine
an
herb
he
brought
all
green
full
of
smalle
leaves
and
plain
swart
and
long
with
many
a
vein
and
where
his
fellow
lay
thus
dead
this
herb
he
down
laid
by
his
head
and
it
full
softely
and
hung
his
head
and
stood
thereby
which
herb
in
less
than
half
an
hour
gan
over
all
knit
and
after
full
out
and
waxed
ripe
the
seed
and
right
as
one
another
feed
would
in
his
beak
he
took
the
grain
and
in
his
fellow
beak
certain
it
put
and
thus
within
the
third
hour
after
it
upstood
and
pruned
him
the
bird
had
died
which
dead
had
been
in
all
our
sight
and
both
together
forth
their
flight
took
singing
from
us
and
their
leave
was
none
disturb
them
would
nor
grieve
and
when
they
parted
were
and
gone
th
abbess
the
seedes
soon
each
one
gathered
had
and
in
her
hand
the
herb
she
took
well
the
leaf
the
seed
the
stalk
the
and
said
it
had
a
good
savour
and
was
no
common
herb
to
find
and
well
approv
of
kind
and
more
than
other
virtuous
whoso
might
it
have
for
to
use
in
his
need
flower
leaf
or
grain
of
his
heal
might
be
certain
she
laid
it
down
upon
the
hearse
where
lay
the
queen
and
gan
rehearse
each
one
to
other
what
they
had
seen
and
thus
the
seed
wax
green
they
and
on
the
dry
hearse
gan
to
spring
which
me
thought
was
a
wondrous
thing
and
after
that
and
new
seed
of
which
the
people
all
took
heed
and
said
it
was
some
great
miracle
or
medicine
fine
more
than
treacle
and
were
well
done
there
to
assay
if
it
might
ease
in
any
way
the
corpses
which
with
torchelight
they
waked
had
there
all
that
night
soon
did
the
lordes
there
consent
and
all
the
people
thereto
content
with
easy
words
and
little
fare
trouble
and
made
the
queene
visage
bare
which
showed
was
to
all
about
wherefore
in
swoon
fell
all
the
rout
crowd
and
were
so
sorry
most
and
least
that
long
of
weeping
they
not
ceas
for
of
their
lord
the
remembrance
unto
them
was
such
displeasance
of
grief
that
for
to
live
they
called
pain
so
were
they
very
true
and
plain
and
after
this
the
good
abbess
of
the
grains
gan
choose
and
three
with
her
fingers
clean
and
smale
and
in
the
queenes
mouth
by
tale
one
after
other
full
easily
she
put
and
eke
full
cunningly
which
showed
some
such
virtue
that
proved
was
the
medicine
true
for
with
a
smiling
countenance
the
queen
uprose
and
of
as
she
was
wont
to
wight
she
good
cheer
for
whiche
sight
a
gracious
the
people
kneeling
on
the
stones
thought
they
in
were
soul
and
bones
and
to
the
prince
where
that
he
lay
they
went
to
make
the
same
assay
experiment
and
when
the
queen
it
understood
and
how
the
medicine
was
good
she
pray
that
she
might
have
the
grains
to
relieve
him
from
the
pains
which
she
and
he
had
both
endur
and
to
him
went
and
so
him
cur
that
within
a
little
space
lusty
and
fresh
alive
he
was
and
in
good
heal
and
whole
of
speech
and
laugh
and
said
gramercy
leach
great
thanks
for
which
the
joy
throughout
the
town
my
physician
so
great
was
that
the
belles
affray
the
people
a
the
distance
of
about
the
city
way
a
day
and
came
and
ask
the
cause
and
why
they
rungen
were
so
stately
solemnly
and
after
that
the
queen
made
diligence
ere
they
would
cease
such
that
of
ladies
soon
a
crowd

a
three

followed
on
a
large

bridal

splendidly
celebrated
and
to
the
sound
of
marvellous
music
the
poet
awoke
to
find
neither
lady
nor
creature
but
only
old
portraitures
on
the
tapestry
of
horsemen
hawks
and
hounds
and

full
of

great
was
his
grief
that
he
had
lost
all
the
bliss
of
his
dream
and
he
concludes
by
praying
his
lady
so
to
accept
his
that
the

may
turn
to

the
prologue
to
the
legend
of
good
women
some
difference
of
opinion
exists
as
to
the
date
at
which
chaucer
wrote
the
legend
of
good
women
those
who
would
fix
that
date
at
a
period
not
long
before
the
poet
death
who
would
place
the
poem
indeed
among
his
closing
labours
support
their
opinion
by
the
fact
that
the
prologue
recites
most
of
chaucer
principal
works
and
glances
besides
at
a
long
array
of
other
productions
too
many
to
be
fully
catalogued
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
objected
that
the
legend
makes
no
mention
of
the
canterbury
tales
as
such
while
two
of
those
tales
the
knight
and
the
second
nun
are
enumerated
by
the
titles
which
they
bore
as
separate
compositions
before
they
were
incorporated
in
the
great
collection
the
love
of
palamon
and
arcite
and
the
life
of
saint
cecile
see
note
to
the
second
nun
tale
tyrwhitt
seems
perfectly
justified
in
placing
the
composition
of
the
poem
immediately
before
that
of
chaucer
magnum
opus
and
after
the
marriage
of
richard
ii
to
his
first
queen
anne
of
bohemia
that
event
took
place
in
and
since
it
is
to
anne
that
the
poet
refers
when
he
makes
alcestis
bid
him
give
his
poem
to
the
queen
at
eltham
or
at
sheen
the
legend
could
not
have
been
written
earlier
the
old
editions
tell
us
that
several
ladies
in
the
court
took
offence
at
chaucer
large
speeches
against
the
untruth
of
women
therefore
the
queen
him
to
compile
this
book
in
the
commendation
of
sundry
maidens
and
wives
who
show
themselves
faithful
to
faithless
men
this
seems
to
have
been
written
after
the
flower
and
the
leaf
evidently
it
was
for
distinct
references
to
that
poem
are
to
be
found
in
the
prologue
but
more
interesting
is
the
indication
which
it
furnishes
that
troilus
and
cressida
was
the
work
not
of
the
poet
youth
but
of
his
maturer
age
we
could
hardly
expect
the
queen
whether
of
love
or
of
england
to
demand
seriously
from
chaucer
a
retractation
of
sentiments
which
he
had
expressed
a
full
generation
before
and
for
which
he
had
made
atonement
by
the
splendid
praises
of
true
love
sung
in
the
court
of
love
the
cuckoo
and
the
nightingale
and
other
poems
of
youth
and
middle
life
but
troilus
and
cressida
is
coupled
with
the
romance
of
the
rose
as
one
of
the
poems
which
had
given
offence
to
the
servants
and
the
god
of
love
therefore
we
may
suppose
it
to
have
more
prominently
engaged
courtly
notice
at
a
later
period
of
the
poet
life
than
even
its
undoubted
popularity
could
explain
at
whatever
date
or
in
whatever
circumstances
undertaken
the
legend
of
good
women
is
a
fragment
there
are
several
signs
that
it
was
designed
to
contain
the
stories
of
ladies
although
the
number
of
the
good
women
is
in
the
poem
itself
set
down
at
nineteen
but
nine
legends
only
were
actually
composed
or
have
come
down
to
us
they
are
those
of
cleopatra
queen
of
egypt
lines
thisbe
of
babylon
dido
queen
of
carthage
hypsipyle
and
medea
lucrece
of

ariadne
of
athens
phiomela
phyllis
and
hypermnestra
prefixed
to
these
stories
which
are
translated
or
imitated
from
ovid
is
a
prologue
containing
lines
the
only
part
of
the
legend
given
in
the
present
edition
it
is
by
far
the
most
original
the
strongest
and
most
pleasing
part
of
the
poem
the
description
of
spring
and
of
his
enjoyment
of
that
season
are
in
chaucer
best
manner
and
the
political
philosophy
by
which
alcestis
mitigates
the
wrath
of
cupid
adds
another
to
the
abounding
proofs
that
for
his
knowledge
of
the
world
chaucer
fairly
merits
the
epithet
of
which
shakespeare
has
won
by
his
knowledge
of
man
a
thousand
times
i
have
hearde
tell
that
there
is
joy
in
and
pain
in
hell
and
i
it
well
that
it
is
so
agree
but
natheless
yet
i
well
also
that
there
is
none
dwelling
in
this
country
that
either
hath
in
or
hell
nor
may
of
it
no
other
wayes

said
or
found
it

may

that

that
the

ginnen
for
to

farewell
my

now
have
i

such
a

when

ye

shall
not

for
to
look
upon
the

but
nathelesse
not

i
not
fancy
that
i
in
praising
of

this
no
more
than
of
the
corn
against
the
sheaf
for
as
to
me
is

with
neither

leaf
nor
who
the
do
i
well
their
service
or
labour
they
profit
for
this
thing
is
all
of
another
tun
of
old
story
ere
such
thing
was
begun
when
that
the
sun
out
of
the
south
gan
west
and
that
this
gan
close
and
go
to
rest
for
darkness
of
the
night
the
which
she
dread
home
to
my
house
full
swiftly
i
me
sped
to
go
to
rest
and
early
for
to
rise
to
see
this
flower
spread
as
i
devise
and
in
a
little
arbour
that
i
have
that
benched
was
of
turfes
fresh
out
i
bade
men
shoulde
me
my
couche
make
for
of
the
newe
summer
sake
i
bade
them
strowe
flowers
on
my
bed
when
i
was
laid
and
had
mine
eyen
hid
i
fell
asleep
within
an
hour
or
two
me
how
i
lay
in
the
meadow
tho
to
see
this
that
i
love
so
and
dread
and
from
afar
came
walking
in
the
mead
the
god
of
love
and
in
his
hand
a
queen
and
she
was
clad
in
royal
habit
green
a
of
gold
she
hadde
next
her
hair
and
upon
that
a
white
corown
she
bare
with
small
and
as
i
shall
not
lie
for
all
the
world
right
as
a
daisy
is
with
white
leaves
lite
so
were
the
flowrons
of
her
crowne
white
for
of
one
pearle
fine
oriential
her
white
crowne
was
all
for
which
the
white
crown
above
the
green
made
her
like
a
daisy
for
to
upon
consider
eke
her
fret
of
gold
above
was
this
mighty
god
of
love
in
silk
embroider
full
of
greene
greves
in
which
there
was
a
fret
of
red
rose
leaves
the
freshest
since
the
world
was
first
begun
his
gilt
hair
was
with
a
sun
lnstead
of
gold
heaviness
and
weight
avoid
therewith
me
thought
his
face
shone
so
bright
that
well
unnethes
might
i
him
behold
and
in
his
hand
me
thought
i
saw
him
hold
two
fiery
dartes
as
the
red
coals
and
his
winges
saw
i
spread
and
that
men
say
that
blind
is
he
me
thoughte
that
he
might
well
see
all
events
for
sternly
upon
me
he
gan
behold
so
that
his
looking
my
hearte
cold
my
heart
and
by
the
hand
he
held
this
noble
queen
grow
crowned
with
white
and
clothed
all
in
green
so
womanly
so
benign
and
so
meek
that
in
this
worlde
though
that
men
would
seek
half
of
her
beauty
shoulde
they
not
find
in
creature
that
formed
is
by
kind
and
therefore
may
i
say
as
thinketh
me
this
song
in
praising
of
this
lady
free
hide
absolon
thy
tresses
clear
esther
lay

thy
meekness
all
adown

my

that

i
pray
to

not

been
dead
without
any

wordes
and
his
cheer
as
when
time
is
hereafter
ye
shall
hear
behind
this
god
of
love
upon
the
green
i
saw
coming
of
ladies
nineteen
in
royal
habit
a
full
easy
pace
and
after
them
of
women
such
a
trace
that
since
that
god
adam
had
made
of
earth
the
thirde
part
of
mankind
or
the
ferth
ween
i
by
possibility
never
had
ever
in
this
wide
world
and
true
of
love
these
women
were
each
one
now
whether
was
that
a
wonder
thing
or
non
that
right
anon
as
that
they
gan
espy
this
which
that
i
call
the
daisy
full
suddenly
they
all
at
once
and
kneeled
down
as
it
were
for
the
nonce
and
sange
with
one
voice
heal
and
honour
to
truth
of
womanhead
and
to
this
bears
our
aller
prize
in
figuring
in
its
figure
bears
her
white
crowne
bears
the
witnessing
the
prize
from
us
and
with
that
word
around
in
a
they
sette
them
full
softely
adown
first
sat
the
god
of
love
and
his
queen
with
the
white
corowne
clad
in
green
and
all
the
remnant
by
and
by
as
they
were
of
estate
full
courteously
and
not
a
word
was
spoken
in
the
place
the
of
a
furlong
way
of
space
i
kneeling
by
this
in
good
intent
abode
to
knowe
what
this
people
meant
as
still
as
any
stone
till
at
the
last
the
god
of
love
on
me
his
eyen
cast
and
said
who
kneeleth
there
and
i
unto
his
asking
when
that
i
it
heard
and
said
it
am
i
and
came
to
him
near
and
him
quoth
he
what
dost
thou
here
so
nigh
mine
owen
so
boldely
it
were
better
worthy
truely
a
worm
to
near
my
than
thou
draw
nigh
and
why
sir
quoth
i
an
it
liketh
you
for
thou
quoth
he
art
thereto
nothing
able
it
is
my
relic
and
delectable
and
thou
my
foe
and
all
my
folk
warrayest
censurest
and
of
mine
olde
servants
thou
missayest
and
them
with
thy
translation
and
folk
from
their
devotion
to
serve
me
and
holdest
it
folly
to
serve
love
thou
it
not
deny
for
in
plain
text
withoute
need
of
glose
gloss
thu
hast
translated
the
romance
of
the
rose
that
is
a
heresy
against
my
law
and
maketh
wise
folk
from
me
withdraw
and
of
cresside
thou
hast
said
as
thee
list
that
maketh
men
to
women
less
to
trust
that
be
as
true
as
was
any
steel
of
thine
answer
thee
right
weel
right
for
though
that
thou
hast
my
lay
my
law
as
other
wretches
have
done
many
a
day
or
by
sainte
venus
that
my
mother
is
if
that
thou
live
thou
shalt
repente
this
so
cruelly
that
it
shall
well
be
seen
then
spake
this
lady
clothed
all
in
green
and
saide
god
right
of
your
courtesy
ye
mighte
hearken
if
he
can
reply
against
all
this
that
ye
have
him
meved
against
a
godde
shoulde
not
be
thus
aggrieved
but
of
his
deity
he
shall
be
stable
and
thereto
gracious
and
merciable
and
if
ye
a
god
that
knoweth
all
not
then
might
it
be
as
i
you
telle
shall
this
man
to
you
may
falsely
be
accused
whereas
by
right
him
ought
to
be
excused
for
in
your
court
is
many
a
losengeour
and
many
a
toteler
accusour
prating
accuser
that
in
your
eares
many
a
soun
right
after
their
imaginatioun
to
have
your
dalliance
and
for
envy
conversation
these
be
the
causes
and
i
shall
not
lie
company
envy
is
of
the
court
alway
for
she
departeth
neither
night
nor
day
out
of
the
house
of
caesar
thus
saith
dant
whoso
that
she
shall
not
want
all
events
and
eke
parauntre
for
this
man
is
nice
he
mighte
do
it
no
malice
for
he
useth
thinges
for
to
make
poetry
him
naught
of
what
mattere
he
take
nothing
or
he
was
bidden
thilke
those
some
person
and
durst
it
not
withsay
deny
or
him
repenteth
utterly
of
this
he
hath
not
done
so
grievously
amiss
to
translate
what
olde
clerkes
write
as
though
that
he
of
malice
would
endite
down
love
and
had
himself
it
wrought
this
should
a
righteous
lord
have
in
his
thought
and
not
be
like
tyrants
of
lombardy
that
have
no
regard
but
at
tyranny
for
he
that
king
or
lord
is
naturel
him
oughte
not
be
tyrant
or
cruel
as
is
a
farmer
to
do
the
harm
he
can
he
muste
think
it
is
his
liegeman
and
is
his
treasure
and
his
gold
in
coffer
this
is
the
of
the
philosopher
sentiment
a
king
to
keep
his
lieges
in
justice
withoute
doubte
that
is
his
office
will
he
keep
his
lords
in
their
degree
as
it
is
right
and
that
they
be
enhanced
and
honoured
and
most
dear
for
they
be
in
this
world
here
yet
must
he
do
both
right
to
poor
and
rich
all
be
that
their
estate
be
not
and
have
of
poore
folk
compassion
for
lo
the
gentle
kind
of
the
lion
for
when
a
fly
offendeth
him
or
biteth
he
with
his
tail
away
the
flye
smiteth
all
easily
for
of
his
him
deigneth
not
to
wreak
him
on
a
fly
as
doth
a
cur
or
else
another
beast
noble
corage
ought
to
be
arrest
a
noble
nature
ought
and
weighen
by
equity
to
be
and
ever
have
regard
to
his
degree
for
sir
it
is
no
mastery
for
a
lord
to
a
man
without
answer
of
word
and
for
a
lord
that
is
foul
to
use
infamous
and
it
be
so
may
him
not
excuse
offender
but
asketh
mercy
with
a
heart
timid
and
proffereth
him
right
in
his
bare
shirt
to
be
right
at
your
owen
judgement
then
ought
a
god
by
short
advisement
consider
his
own
honour
and
his
trespass
for
since
no
of
death
lies
in
this
case
you
ought
to
be
the
lighter
merciable
your
ire
and
be
somewhat
tractable
this
man
hath
served
you
of
his
cunning
skill
and
further
well
your
law
in
his
making
poetry
albeit
that
he
can
not
well
endite
yet
hath
he
made
folk
delight
to
serve
you
in
praising
of
your
name
he
made
the
book
that
hight
the
house
of
fame
and
eke
the
death
of
blanche
the
duchess
and
the
parliament
of
fowles
as
i
guess
and
all
the
love
of
palamon
and
arcite
of
thebes
though
the
story
is
known

and
many
a
hymne
for
your
holydays

hath
in

life
also
of
saint
cecile
he
made
also
gone
is
a
greate
while
origenes
upon
the
magdalene
him
oughte
now
to
have
the
lesse
pain
he
hath
made
many
a
lay
and
many
a
thing
now
as
ye
be
a
god
and
eke
a
king
i
your
alcestis
whilom
queen
of
thrace
i
aske
you
this
man
right
of
your
grace
that
ye
him
never
hurt
in
all
his
life
and
he
shall
sweare
to
you
and
that
blife
he
shall
no
more
in
this
wise
but
shall
maken
as
ye
will
him
devise
of
women
true
in
loving
all
their
life
whereso
ye
will
of
maiden
or
of
wife
and
further
you
as
much
as
he
missaid
in
the
rose
or
elles
in
cresseide
the
god
of
love
answered
her
anon
madame
quoth
he
it
is
so
long
agone
that
i
you
knew
so
charitable
and
true
that
never
yet
since
that
the
world
was
new
to
me
ne
found
i
better
none
than
ye
if
that
i
woulde
save
my
degree
i
may
nor
will
not
your
request
all
lies
in
you
do
with
him
as
you
lest
i
all
forgive
withoute
longer
space
for
he
who
gives
a
gift
or
doth
a
grace
do
it
betimes
his
thank
is
well
the
more
and
ye
what
he
shall
do
therefor
go
thanke
now
my
lady
here
quoth
he
i
rose
and
down
i
set
me
on
my
knee
and
saide
thus
madame
the
god
above
you
that
ye
the
god
of
love
have
made
me
his
wrathe
to
forgive
and
so
longe
for
to
live
me
grace
that
i
may
knowe
soothly
what
ye
be
that
have
me
help
and
put
in
this
degree
but
truely
i
ween
as
in
this
case
naught
t
have
aguilt
nor
done
to
love
trespass
for
why
a
true
man
withoute
dread
hath
not
parte
a
thieve
deed
share
nor
a
true
lover
oughte
me
to
blame
though
that
i
spoke
a
false
lover
some
shame
they
oughte
rather
with
me
for
to
hold
for
that
i
of
cressida
wrote
or
told
or
of
the
rose
so
mine
author
meant
a
true
algate
god
wot
it
was
mine
intent
all
ways
to
further
truth
in
love
and
it
cherice
and
to
beware
from
falseness
and
from
vice
by
such
example
this
was
my
meaning
and
she
answer
let
be
thine
arguing
for
love
will
not
counterpleaded
be
in
right
nor
wrong
and
learne
that
of
me
thou
hast
thy
grace
and
hold
thee
right
thereto
now
will
i
say
what
penance
thou
shalt
do
for
thy
trespass
and
understand
it
here
thou
shalt
while
that
thou
livest
year
by
year
the
moste
partie
of
thy
time
spend
in
making
of
a
glorious
legend
of
goode
women
maidenes
and
wives
that
were
true
in
loving
all
their
lives
and
tell
of
false
men
that
them
betray
that
all
their
life
do
naught
but
assay
how
many
women
they
may
do
a
shame
for
in
your
world
that
is
now
a
game
a
and
though
thou
like
not
a
lover
be
speak
well
of
love
this
penance
give
i
thee
and
to
the
god
of
love
i
shall
so
pray
that
he
shall
charge
his
servants
by
any
way
to
further
thee
and
well
thy
labour
quite
go
now
thy
way
thy
penance
is
but
lite
and
when
this
book
ye
make
give
it
the
queen
on
my
behalf
at
eltham
or
at
sheen
the
god
of
love
gan
smile
and
then
he
said
thou
quoth
he
whether
this
be
wife
or
maid
or
queen
or
countess
or
of
what
degree
that
hath
so
little
penance
given
thee
that
hath
deserved
sorely
for
to
smart
but

in
heart
born
that

she
what
she
is
and

more
true

had
no

rule
