far
away
and
long
ago
once
there
was
another
sun
and
another
moon
a
different
sun
and
a
different
moon
from
the
ones
we
see
now
sol
was
the
name
of
that
sun
and
mani
was
the
name
of
that
moon
but
always
behind
sol
and
mani
wolves
went
a
wolf
behind
each
the
wolves
caught
on
them
at
last
and
they
devoured
sol
and
mani
and
then
the
world
was
in
darkness
and
cold
in
those
times
the
gods
lived
odin
and
thor
hödur
and
baldur
tyr

vidar
and

as
well
as

the

and
sif
but
in
the
days
when
the
sun
and

were
destroyed
the
gods
were
destroyed
too
all
the
gods
except
baldur
who
had
died
before
that
time
vidar
and
vali
the
sons
of
odin
and
modi
and
magni
the
sons
of
thor
at
that
time
too
there
were
men
and
women
in
the
world
but
before
the
sun
and
the
moon
were
devoured
and
before
the
gods
were
destroyed
terrible
things
happened
in
the
world
snow
fell
on
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
and
kept
on
falling
for
three
seasons
winds
came
and
blew
everything
away
and
the
people
of
the
world
who
had
lived
on
in
spite
of
the
snow
and
the
cold
and
the
winds
fought
each
other
brother
killing
brother
until
all
the
people
were
destroyed
also
there
was
another
earth
at
that
time
an
earth
green
and
beautiful
but
the
terrible
winds
that
blew
leveled
down
forests
and
hills
and
dwellings
then
fire
came
and
burnt
the
earth
there
was
darkness
for
the
sun
and
the
moon
were
devoured
the
gods
had
met
with
their
doom
and
the
time
in
which
all
these
things
happened
was
called
ragnarök
the
twilight
of
the
gods
then
a
new
sun
and
a
new
moon
appeared
and
went
traveling
through
the
heavens
they
were
more
lovely
than
sol
and
mani
and
no
wolves
followed
behind
them
in
chase
the
earth
became
green
and
beautiful
again
and
in
a
deep
forest
that
the
fire
had
not
burnt
a
woman
and
a
man
wakened
up
they
had
been
hidden
there
by
odin
and
left
to
sleep
during
ragnarök
the
twilight
of
the
gods
lif
was
the
woman
name
and
lifthrasir
was
the
man
they
moved
through
the
world
and
their
children
and
their
children
children
made
people
for
the
new
earth
and
of
the
gods
were
left
vidar
and
vali
the
sons
of
odin
and
modi
and
magni
the
sons
of
thor
on
the
new
earth
vidar
and
vali
found
tablets
that
the
older
gods
had
written
on
and
had
left
there
for
them
tablets
telling
of
all
that
had
happened
before
ragnarök
the
twilight
of
the
gods
and
the
people
who
lived
after
ragnarök
the
twilight
of
the
gods
were
not
troubled
as
the
people
in
the
older
days
were
troubled
by
the
terrible
beings
who
had
brought
destruction
upon
the
world
and
upon
men
and
women
and
who
from
the
beginning
had
waged
war
upon
the
gods
illustration
the
building
of
the
wall
always
there
had
been
war
between
the
giants
and
the
gods
between
the
giants
who
would
have
destroyed
the
world
and
the
race
of
men
and
the
gods
who
would
have
protected
the
race
of
men
and
would
have
made
the
world
more
beautiful
there
are
many
stories
to
be
told
about
the
gods
but
the
first
one
that
should
be
told
to
you
is
the
one
about
the
building
of
their
city
the
gods
had
made
their
way
up
to
the
top
of
a
high
mountain
and
there
they
decided
to
build
a
great
city
for
themselves
that
the
giants
could
never
overthrow
the
city
they
would
call
asgard
which
means
the
place
of
the
gods
they
would
build
it
on
a
beautiful
plain
that
was
on
the
top
of
that
high
mountain
and
they
wanted
to
raise
round
their
city
the
highest
and
strongest
wall
that
had
ever
been
built
now
one
day
when
they
were
beginning
to
build
their
halls
and
their
palaces
a
strange
being
came
to
them
odin
the
father
of
the
gods
went
and
spoke
to
him
what
dost
thou
want
on
the
mountain
of
the
gods
he
asked
the
stranger
i
know
what
is
in
the
mind
of
the
gods
the
stranger
said
they
would
build
a
city
here
i
can
not
build
palaces
but
i
can
build
great
walls
that
can
never
be
overthrown
let
me
build
the
wall
round
your
city
how
long
will
it
take
you
to
build
a
wall
that
will
go
round
our
city
said
the
father
of
the
gods
a
year
o
odin
said
the
stranger
now
odin
knew
that
if
a
great
wall
could
be
built
around
it
the
gods
would
not
have
to
spend
all
their
time
defending
their
city
asgard
from
the
giants
and
he
knew
that
if
asgard
were
protected
he
himself
could
go
amongst
men
and
teach
them
and
help
them
he
thought
that
no
payment
the
stranger
could
ask
would
be
too
much
for
the
building
of
that
wall
that
day
the
stranger
came
to
the
council
of
the
gods
and
he
swore
that
in
a
year
he
would
have
the
great
wall
built
then
odin
made
oath
that
the
gods
would
give
him
what
he
asked
in
payment
if
the
wall
was
finished
to
the
last
stone
in
a
year
from
that
day
the
stranger
went
away
and
came
back
on
the
morrow
it
was
the
first
day
of
summer
when
he
started
work
he
brought
no
one
to
help
him
except
a
great
horse
now
the
gods
thought
that
this
horse
would
do
no
more
than
drag
blocks
of
stone
for
the
building
of
the
wall
but
the
horse
did
more
than
this
he
set
the
stones
in
their
places
and
mortared
them
together
and
day
and
night
and
by
light
and
dark
the
horse
worked
and
soon
a
great
wall
was
rising
round
the
palaces
that
the
gods
themselves
were
building
what
reward
will
the
stranger
ask
for
the
work
he
is
doing
for
us
the
gods
asked
one
another
odin
went
to
the
stranger
we
marvel
at
the
work
you
and
your
horse
are
doing
for
us
he
said
no
one
can
doubt
that
the
great
wall
of
asgard
will
be
built
up
by
the
first
day
of
summer
what
reward
do
you
claim
we
would
have
it
ready
for
you
the
stranger
turned
from
the
work
he
was
doing
leaving
the
great
horse
to
pile
up
the
blocks
of
stone
o
father
of
the
gods
he
said
o
odin
the
reward
i
shall
ask
for
my
work
is
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
freya
who
watches
over
the
flowers
and
grasses
for
my
wife
now
when
odin
heard
this
he
was
terribly
angered
for
the
price
the
stranger
asked
for
his
work
was
beyond
all
prices
he
went
amongst
the
other
gods
who
were
then
building
their
shining
palaces
within
the
great
wall
and
he
told
them
what
reward
the
stranger
had
asked
the
gods
said
without
the
sun
and
the
moon
the
world
will
wither
away
and
the
goddesses
said
without
freya
all
will
be
gloom
in
asgard
they
would
have
let
the
wall
remain
unbuilt
rather
than
let
the
stranger
have
the
reward
he
claimed
for
building
it
but
one
who
was
in
the
company
of
the
gods
spoke
he
was
loki
a
being
who
only
half
belonged
to
the
gods
his
father
was
the
wind
giant
let
the
stranger
build
the
wall
round
asgard
loki
said
and
i
will
find
a
way
to
make
him
give
up
the
hard
bargain
he
has
made
with
the
gods
go
to
him
and
tell
him
that
the
wall
must
be
finished
by
the
first
day
of
summer
and
that
if
it
is
not
finished
to
the
last
stone
on
that
day
the
price
he
asks
will
not
be
given
to
him
the
gods
went
to
the
stranger
and
they
told
him
that
if
the
last
stone
was
not
laid
on
the
wall
on
the
first
day
of
the
summer
not
sol
or
mani
the
sun
and
the
moon
nor
freya
would
be
given
him
and
now
they
knew
that
the
stranger
was
one
of
the
giants
the
giant
and
his
great
horse
piled
up
the
wall
more
quickly
than
before
at
night
while
the
giant
slept
the
horse
worked
on
and
on
hauling
up
stones
and
laying
them
on
the
wall
with
his
great
forefeet
and
day
by
day
the
wall
around
asgard
grew
higher
and
higher
but
the
gods
had
no
joy
in
seeing
that
great
wall
rising
higher
and
higher
around
their
palaces
the
giant
and
his
horse
would
finish
the
work
by
the
first
day
of
summer
and
then
he
would
take
the
sun
and
the
moon
sol
and
mani
and
freya
away
with
him
but
loki
was
not
disturbed
he
kept
telling
the
gods
that
he
would
find
a
way
to
prevent
him
from
finishing
his
work
and
thus
he
would
make
the
giant
forfeit
the
terrible
price
he
had
led
odin
to
promise
him
it
was
three
days
to
summer
time
all
the
wall
was
finished
except
the
gateway
over
the
gateway
a
stone
was
still
to
be
placed
and
the
giant
before
he
went
to
sleep
bade
his
horse
haul
up
a
great
block
of
stone
so
that
they
might
put
it
above
the
gateway
in
the
morning
and
so
finish
the
work
two
full
days
before
summer
it
happened
to
be
a
beautiful
moonlit
night
svadilfare
the
great
horse
was
hauling
the
largest
stone
he
ever
hauled
when
he
saw
a
little
mare
come
galloping
toward
him
the
great
horse
had
never
seen
so
pretty
a
little
mare
and
he
looked
at
her
with
surprise
svadilfare
slave
said
the
little
mare
to
him
and
went
frisking
past
svadilfare
put
down
the
stone
he
was
hauling
and
called
to
the
little
mare
she
came
back
to
him
why
do
you
call
me
slave
said
the
great
horse
because
you
have
to
work
night
and
day
for
your
master
said
the
little
mare
he
keeps
you
working
working
working
and
never
lets
you
enjoy
yourself
you
dare
not
leave
that
stone
down
and
come
and
play
with
me
who
told
you
i
dare
not
do
it
said
svadilfare
i
know
you
dare
do
it
said
the
little
mare
and
she
kicked
up
her
heels
and
ran
across
the
moonlit
meadow
now
the
truth
is
that
svadilfare
was
tired
of
working
day
and
night
when
he
saw
the
little
mare
go
galloping
off
he
became
suddenly
discontented
he
left
the
stone
he
was
hauling
on
the
ground
he
looked
round
and
he
saw
the
little
mare
looking
back
at
him
he
galloped
after
her
he
did
not
catch
up
on
the
little
mare
she
went
on
swiftly
before
him
on
she
went
over
the
moonlit
meadow
turning
and
looking
back
now
and
again
at
the
great
svadilfare
who
came
heavily
after
her
down
the
mountainside
the
mare
went
and
svadilfare
who
now
rejoiced
in
his
liberty
and
in
the
freshness
of
the
wind
and
in
the
smell
of
the
flowers
still
followed
her
with
the
morning
light
they
came
near
a
cave
and
the
little
mare
went
into
it
they
went
through
the
cave
then
svadilfare
caught
up
on
the
little
mare
and
the
two
went
wandering
together
the
little
mare
telling
svadilfare
stories
of
the
dwarfs
and
the
elves
they
came
to
a
grove
and
they
stayed
together
in
it
the
little
mare
playing
so
nicely
with
him
that
the
great
horse
forgot
all
about
time
passing
and
while
they
were
in
the
grove
the
giant
was
going
up
and
down
searching
for
his
great
horse
he
had
come
to
the
wall
in
the
morning
expecting
to
put
the
stone
over
the
gateway
and
so
finish
his
work
but
the
stone
that
was
to
be
lifted
up
was
not
near
him
he
called
for
svadilfare
but
his
great
horse
did
not
come
he
went
to
search
for
him
and
he
searched
all
down
the
mountainside
and
he
searched
as
far
across
the
earth
as
the
realm
of
the
giants
but
he
did
not
find
svadilfare
the
gods
saw
the
first
day
of
summer
come
and
the
gateway
of
the
wall
stand
unfinished
they
said
to
each
other
that
if
it
were
not
finished
by
the
evening
they
need
not
give
sol
and
mani
to
the
giant
nor
the
maiden
freya
to
be
his
wife
the
hours
of
the
summer
day
went
past
and
the
giant
did
not
raise
the
stone
over
the
gateway
in
the
evening
he
came
before
them
your
work
is
not
finished
odin
said
you
forced
us
to
a
hard
bargain
and
now
we
need
not
keep
it
with
you
you
shall
not
be
given
sol
and
mani
nor
the
maiden
freya
only
the
wall
i
have
built
is
so
strong
i
would
tear
it
down
said
the
giant
he
tried
to
throw
down
one
of
the
palaces
but
the
gods
laid
hands
on
him
and
thrust
him
outside
the
wall
he
had
built
go
and
trouble
asgard
no
more
odin
commanded
then
loki
returned
to
asgard
he
told
the
gods
how
he
had
transformed
himself
into
a
little
mare
and
had
led
away
svadilfare
the
great
horse
and
the
gods
sat
in
their
golden
palaces
behind
the
great
wall
and
rejoiced
that
their
city
was
now
secure
and
that
no
enemy
could
ever
enter
it
or
overthrow
it
but
odin
the
father
of
the
gods
as
he
sat
upon
his
throne
was
sad
in
his
heart
sad
that
the
gods
had
got
their
wall
built
by
a
trick
that
oaths
had
been
broken
and
that
a
blow
had
been
struck
in
injustice
in
asgard
illustration
iduna
and
her
apples
how
loki
put
the
gods
in
danger
in
asgard
there
was
a
garden
and
in
that
garden
there
grew
a
tree
and
on
that
tree
there
grew
shining
apples
thou
knowst
o
one
that
every
day
that
passes
makes
us
older
and
brings
us
to
that
day
when
we
will
be
bent
and
feeble
and
but
those
shining
apples
that
grew
in
asgard
they
who
ate
of
them
every
day
grew
never
a
day
older
for
the
eating
of
the
apples
kept
old
age
away
iduna
the
goddess
tended
the
tree
on
which
the
shining
apples
grew
none
would
grow
on
the
tree
unless
she
was
there
to
tend
it
no
one
but
iduna
might
pluck
the
shining
apples
each
morning
she
plucked
them
and
left
them
in
her
basket
and
every
day
the
gods
and
goddesses
came
to
her
garden
that
they
might
eat
the
shining
apples
and
so
stay
for
ever
young
iduna
never
went
from
her
garden
all
day
and
every
day
she
stayed
in
the
garden
or
in
her
golden
house
beside
it
and
all
day
and
every
day
she
listened
to
bragi
her
husband
tell
a
story
that
never
had
an
end
ah
but
a
time
came
when
iduna
and
her
apples
were
lost
to
asgard
and
the
gods
and
goddesses
felt
old
age
approach
them
how
all
that
happened
shall
be
told
thee
o
well
beloved
odin
the
father
of
the
gods
often
went
into
the
land
of
men
to
watch
over
their
doings
once
he
took
loki
with
him
loki
the
doer
of
good
and
the
doer
of
evil
for
a
long
time
they
went
traveling
through
the
world
of
men
at
last
they
came
near
jötunheim
the
realm
of
the
giants
it
was
a
bleak
and
empty
region
there
were
no
growing
things
there
not
even
trees
with
berries
there
were
no
birds
there
were
no
animals
as
odin
the
father
of
the
gods
and
loki
the
doer
of
good
and
the
doer
of
evil
went
through
this
region
hunger
came
upon
them
but
in
all
the
land
around
they
saw
nothing
that
they
could
eat
loki
running
here
and
running
there
came
at
last
upon
a
herd
of
wild
cattle
creeping
up
on
them
he
caught
hold
of
a
young
bull
and
killed
him
then
he
cut
up
the
flesh
into
strips
of
meat
he
lighted
a
fire
and
put
the
meat
on
spits
to
roast
while
the
meat
was
being
cooked
odin
the
father
of
the
gods
a
little
way
off
sat
thinking
on
the
things
he
had
seen
in
the
world
of
men
loki
made
himself
busy
putting
more
and
more
logs
on
the
fire
at
last
he
called
to
odin
and
the
father
of
the
gods
came
and
sat
down
near
the
fire
to
eat
the
meal
but
when
the
meat
was
taken
off
the
and
when
odin
went
to
cut
it
he
found
that
it
was
still
raw
he
smiled
at
loki
for
thinking
the
meat
was
cooked
and
loki
troubled
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
put
the
meat
back
and
put
more
logs
upon
the
fire
again
loki
took
the
meat
off
the
and
called
odin
to
the
meal
odin
when
he
took
the
meat
that
loki
brought
him
found
that
it
was
as
raw
as
if
it
had
never
been
put
upon
the
fire
is
this
a
trick
of
yours
loki
he
said
loki
was
so
angry
at
the
meat
being
uncooked
that
odin
saw
he
was
playing
no
tricks
in
his
hunger
he
raged
at
the
meat
and
he
raged
at
the
fire
again
he
put
the
meat
on
the
and
put
more
logs
on
the
fire
every
hour
he
would
take
up
the
meat
sure
that
it
was
now
cooked
and
every
time
he
took
it
off
odin
would
find
that
the
meat
was
as
raw
as
the
first
time
they
took
it
off
the
fire
now
odin
knew
that
the
meat
must
be
under
some
enchantment
by
the
giants
he
stood
up
and
went
on
his
way
hungry
but
strong
loki
however
would
not
leave
the
meat
that
he
had
put
back
on
the
fire
he
would
make
it
be
cooked
he
declared
and
he
would
not
leave
that
place
hungry
the
dawn
came
and
he
took
up
the
meat
again
as
he
was
lifting
it
off
the
fire
he
heard
a
whirr
of
wings
above
his
head
looking
up
he
saw
a
mighty
eagle
the
largest
eagle
that
ever
appeared
in
the
sky
the
eagle
circled
round
and
round
and
came
above
loki
head
canst
thou
not
cook
thy
food
the
eagle
screamed
to
him
i
can
not
cook
it
said
loki
i
will
cook
it
for
thee
if
thou
wilt
give
me
a
share
screamed
the
eagle
come
then
and
cook
it
for
me
said
loki
the
eagle
circled
round
until
he
was
above
the
fire
then
flapping
his
great
wings
over
it
he
made
the
fire
blaze
and
blaze
a
heat
that
loki
had
never
felt
before
came
from
the
burning
logs
in
a
minute
he
drew
the
meat
from
the
spits
and
found
it
was
well
cooked
my
share
my
share
give
me
my
share
the
eagle
screamed
at
him
he
flew
down
and
seizing
on
a
large
piece
of
meat
instantly
devoured
it
he
seized
on
another
piece
piece
after
piece
he
devoured
until
it
looked
as
if
loki
would
be
left
with
no
meat
for
his
meal
as
the
eagle
seized
on
the
last
piece
loki
became
angry
indeed
taking
up
the
spit
on
which
the
meat
had
been
cooked
he
struck
at
the
eagle
there
was
a
clang
as
if
he
had
struck
some
metal
the
wood
of
the
spit
did
not
come
away
it
stuck
to
the
breast
of
the
eagle
but
loki
did
not
let
go
his
hold
on
the
spit
suddenly
the
eagle
rose
up
in
the
air
loki
who
held
to
the
spit
that
was
fastened
to
the
eagle
breast
was
drawn
up
with
him
before
he
knew
what
had
happened
loki
was
miles
and
miles
up
in
the
air
and
the
eagle
was
flying
with
him
toward
jötunheim
the
realm
of
the
giants
and
the
eagle
was
screaming
out
loki
friend
loki
i
have
thee
at
last
it
was
thou
who
didst
cheat
my
brother
of
his
reward
for
building
the
wall
round
asgard
but
loki
i
have
thee
at
last
know
now
that
thiassi
the
giant
has
captured
thee
o
loki
most
cunning
of
the
dwellers
in
asgard
thus
the
eagle
screamed
as
he
went
flying
with
loki
toward
jötunheim
the
realm
of
the
giants
they
passed
over
the
river
that
divides
jötunheim
from
midgard
the
world
of
men
and
now
loki
saw
a
terrible
place
beneath
him
a
land
of
ice
and
rock
great
mountains
were
there
they
were
lighted
by
neither
sun
nor
moon
but
by
columns
of
fire
thrown
up
now
and
again
through
cracks
in
the
earth
or
out
of
the
peaks
of
the
mountains
over
a
great
iceberg
the
eagle
hovered
suddenly
he
shook
the
spit
from
his
breast
and
loki
fell
down
on
the
ice
the
eagle
screamed
out
to
him
thou
art
in
my
power
at
last
o
thou
most
cunning
of
all
the
dwellers
in
asgard
the
eagle
left
loki
there
and
flew
within
a
crack
in
the
mountain
miserable
indeed
was
loki
upon
that
iceberg
the
cold
was
deadly
he
could
not
die
there
for
he
was
one
of
the
dwellers
in
asgard
and
death
might
not
come
to
him
that
way
he
might
not
die
but
he
felt
bound
to
that
iceberg
with
chains
of
cold
after
a
day
his
captor
came
to
him
not
as
an
eagle
this
time
but
in
his
own
form
thiassi
the
giant
wouldst
thou
leave
thine
iceberg
loki
he
said
and
return
to
thy
pleasant
place
in
asgard
thou
dost
delight
in
asgard
although
only
by
dost
thou
belong
to
the
gods
thy
father
loki
was
the
wind
giant
o
that
i
might
leave
this
iceberg
loki
said
with
the
tears
freezing
on
his
face
thou
mayst
leave
it
when
thou
showest
thyself
ready
to
pay
thy
ransom
to
me
said
thiassi
thou
wilt
have
to
get
me
the
shining
apples
that
iduna
keeps
in
her
basket
i
can
not
get
iduna
apples
for
thee
thiassi
said
loki
then
stay
upon
the
iceberg
said
thiassi
the
giant
he
went
away
and
left
loki
there
with
the
terrible
winds
buffeting
him
as
with
blows
of
a
hammer
when
thiassi
came
again
and
spoke
to
him
about
his
ransom
loki
said
there
is
no
way
of
getting
the
shining
apples
from
iduna
there
must
be
some
way
o
cunning
loki
said
the
giant
iduna
although
she
guards
well
the
shining
apples
is
said
loki
it
may
be
that
i
shall
be
able
to
get
her
to
go
outside
the
wall
of
asgard
if
she
goes
she
will
bring
her
shining
apples
with
her
for
she
never
lets
them
go
out
of
her
hand
except
when
she
gives
them
to
the
gods
and
goddesses
to
eat
make
it
so
that
she
will
go
beyond
the
wall
of
asgard
said
the
giant
if
she
goes
outside
of
the
wall
i
shall
get
the
apples
from
her
swear
by
the
that
thou
wilt
lure
iduna
beyond
the
wall
of
asgard
swear
it
loki
and
i
shall
let
thee
go
i
swear
it
by
ygdrassil
the
that
i
will
lure
iduna
beyond
the
wall
of
asgard
if
thou
wilt
take
me
off
this
iceberg
said
loki
then
thiassi
changed
himself
into
a
mighty
eagle
and
taking
loki
in
his
talons
he
flew
with
him
over
the
stream
that
divides
jötunheim
the
realm
of
the
giants
from
midgard
the
world
of
men
he
left
loki
on
the
ground
of
midgard
and
loki
then
went
on
his
way
to
asgard
now
odin
had
already
returned
and
he
had
told
the
dwellers
in
asgard
of
loki
attempt
to
cook
the
enchanted
meat
all
laughed
to
think
that
loki
had
been
left
hungry
for
all
his
cunning
then
when
he
came
into
asgard
looking
so
famished
they
thought
it
was
because
loki
had
had
nothing
to
eat
they
laughed
at
him
more
and
more
but
they
brought
him
into
the
feast
hall
and
they
gave
him
the
best
of
food
with
wine
out
of
odin
wine
cup
when
the
feast
was
over
the
dwellers
in
asgard
went
to
iduna
garden
as
was
their
wont
there
sat
iduna
in
the
golden
house
that
opened
on
her
garden
had
she
been
in
the
world
of
men
every
one
who
saw
her
would
have
remembered
their
own
innocence
seeing
one
who
was
so
fair
and
good
she
had
eyes
blue
as
the
blue
sky
and
she
smiled
as
if
she
were
remembering
lovely
things
she
had
seen
or
heard
the
basket
of
shining
apples
was
beside
her
to
each
god
and
goddess
iduna
gave
a
shining
apple
each
one
ate
the
apple
given
rejoicing
to
think
that
they
would
never
become
a
day
older
then
odin
the
father
of
the
gods
said
the
runes
that
were
always
said
in
praise
of
iduna
and
the
dwellers
in
asgard
went
out
of
iduna
garden
each
one
going
to
his
or
her
own
shining
house
all
went
except
loki
the
doer
of
good
and
the
doer
of
evil
loki
sat
in
the
garden
watching
fair
and
simple
iduna
after
a
while
she
spoke
to
him
and
said
why
dost
thou
still
stay
here
wise
loki
to
look
well
on
thine
apples
loki
said
i
am
wondering
if
the
apples
i
saw
yesterday
are
really
as
shining
as
the
apples
that
are
in
thy
basket
there
are
no
apples
in
the
world
as
shining
as
mine
said
iduna
the
apples
i
saw
were
more
shining
said
loki
aye
and
they
smelled
better
iduna
iduna
was
troubled
at
what
loki
whom
she
deemed
so
wise
told
her
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
that
there
might
be
more
shining
apples
in
the
world
than
hers
o
loki
she
said
it
can
not
be
no
apples
are
more
shining
and
none
smell
so
sweet
as
the
apples
i
pluck
off
the
tree
in
my
garden
go
then
and
see
said
loki
just
outside
asgard
is
the
tree
that
has
the
apples
i
saw
thou
iduna
dost
never
leave
thy
garden
and
so
thou
dost
not
know
what
grows
in
the
world
go
outside
of
asgard
and
see
i
will
go
loki
said
iduna
the
fair
and
simple
iduna
went
outside
the
wall
of
asgard
she
went
to
the
place
loki
had
told
her
that
the
apples
grew
in
but
as
she
looked
this
way
and
that
way
iduna
heard
a
whirr
of
wings
above
her
looking
up
she
saw
a
mighty
eagle
the
largest
eagle
that
had
ever
appeared
in
the
sky
she
drew
back
toward
the
gate
of
asgard
then
the
great
eagle
swooped
down
iduna
felt
herself
lifted
up
and
then
she
was
being
carried
away
from
asgard
away
away
away
over
midgard
where
men
lived
away
toward
the
rocks
and
snows
of
jötunheim
across
the
river
that
flows
between
the
world
of
men
and
the
realm
of
the
giants
iduna
was
borne
then
the
eagle
flew
into
a
cleft
in
a
mountain
and
iduna
was
left
in
a
cavernous
hall
lighted
up
by
columns
of
fire
that
burst
up
from
the
earth
the
eagle
loosened
his
grip
on
iduna
and
she
sank
down
on
the
ground
of
the
cavern
the
wings
and
the
feathers
fell
from
him
and
she
saw
her
captor
as
a
terrible
giant
oh
why
have
you
carried
me
off
from
asgard
and
brought
me
to
this
place
iduna
cried
that
i
might
eat
your
shining
apples
iduna
said
thiassi
the
giant
that
will
never
be
for
i
will
not
give
them
to
you
said
iduna
give
me
the
apples
to
eat
and
i
shall
carry
you
back
to
asgard
no
no
that
can
not
be
i
have
been
trusted
with
the
shining
apples
that
i
might
give
them
to
the
gods
only
then
i
shall
take
the
apples
from
you
said
thiassi
the
giant
he
took
the
basket
out
of
her
hands
and
opened
it
but
when
he
touched
the
apples
they
shriveled
under
his
hands
he
left
them
in
the
basket
and
he
set
the
basket
down
for
he
knew
now
that
the
apples
would
be
no
good
to
him
unless
iduna
gave
them
to
him
with
her
own
hands
you
must
stay
with
me
here
until
you
give
me
the
shining
apples
he
said
to
her
then
was
poor
iduna
frightened
she
was
frightened
of
the
strange
cave
and
frightened
of
the
fire
that
kept
bursting
up
out
of
the
earth
and
she
was
frightened
of
the
terrible
giant
but
above
all
she
was
frightened
to
think
of
the
evil
that
would
fall
upon
the
dwellers
in
asgard
if
she
were
not
there
to
give
them
the
shining
apples
to
eat
the
giant
came
to
her
again
but
still
iduna
would
not
give
him
the
shining
apples
and
there
in
the
cave
she
stayed
the
giant
troubling
her
every
day
and
she
grew
more
and
more
fearful
as
she
saw
in
her
dreams
the
dwellers
in
asgard
go
to
her
garden
go
there
and
not
being
given
the
shining
apples
feel
and
see
a
change
coming
over
themselves
and
over
each
other
it
was
as
iduna
saw
it
in
her
dreams
every
day
the
dwellers
in
asgard
went
to
her
garden
odin
and
thor
hödur
and
baldur
tyr
and
heimdall
vidar
and
vali
with
frigga
freya
nanna
and
sif
there
was
no
one
to
pluck
the
apples
of
their
tree
and
a
change
began
to
come
over
the
gods
and
goddesses
they
no
longer
walked
lightly
their
shoulders
became
bent
their
eyes
no
longer
were
as
bright
as
dewdrops
and
when
they
looked
upon
one
another
they
saw
the
change
age
was
coming
upon
the
dwellers
in
asgard
they
knew
that
the
time
would
come
when
frigga
would
be
gray
and
old
when
sif
golden
hair
would
fade
when
odin
would
no
longer
have
his
clear
wisdom
and
when
thor
would
not
have
strength
enough
to
raise
and
fling
his
thunderbolts
and
the
dwellers
in
asgard
were
saddened
by
this
knowledge
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
all
brightness
had
gone
from
their
shining
city
where
was
iduna
whose
apples
would
give
back
youth
and
strength
and
beauty
to
the
dwellers
in
asgard
the
gods
had
searched
for
her
through
the
world
of
men
no
trace
of
her
did
they
find
but
now
odin
searching
through
his
wisdom
saw
a
means
to
get
knowledge
of
where
iduna
was
hidden
he
summoned
his
two
ravens
hugin
and
munin
his
two
ravens
that
flew
through
the
earth
and
through
the
realm
of
the
giants
and
that
knew
all
things
that
were
past
and
all
things
that
were
to
come
he
summoned
hugin
and
munin
and
they
came
and
one
sat
on
his
right
shoulder
and
one
sat
on
his
left
shoulder
and
they
told
him
deep
secrets
they
told
him
of
thiassi
and
of
his
desire
for
the
shining
apples
that
the
dwellers
in
asgard
ate
and
of
loki
deception
of
iduna
the
fair
and
simple
what
odin
learnt
from
his
ravens
was
told
in
the
council
of
the
gods
then
thor
the
strong
went
to
loki
and
laid
hands
upon
him
when
loki
found
himself
in
the
grip
of
the
strong
god
he
said
what
wouldst
thou
with
me
o
thor
i
would
hurl
thee
into
a
chasm
in
the
ground
and
strike
thee
with
my
thunder
said
the
strong
god
it
was
thou
who
didst
bring
it
about
that
iduna
went
from
asgard
o
thor
said
loki
do
not
crush
me
with
thy
thunder
let
me
stay
in
asgard
i
will
strive
to
win
iduna
back
the
judgment
of
the
gods
said
thor
is
that
thou
the
cunning
one
shouldst
go
to
jötunheim
and
by
thy
craft
win
iduna
back
from
the
giants
go
or
else
i
shall
hurl
thee
into
a
chasm
and
crush
thee
with
my
thunder
i
will
go
said
loki
from
frigga
the
wife
of
odin
loki
borrowed
the
dress
of
falcon
feathers
that
she
owned
he
clad
himself
in
it
and
flew
to
jötunheim
in
the
form
of
a
falcon
he
searched
through
jötunheim
until
he
found
thiassi
daughter
skadi
he
flew
before
skadi
and
he
let
the
giant
maid
catch
him
and
hold
him
as
a
pet
one
day
the
giant
maid
carried
him
into
the
cave
where
iduna
the
fair
and
simple
was
held
when
loki
saw
iduna
there
he
knew
that
part
of
his
quest
was
ended
now
he
had
to
get
iduna
out
of
jötunheim
and
away
to
asgard
he
stayed
no
more
with
the
giant
maid
but
flew
up
into
the
high
rocks
of
the
cave
skadi
wept
for
the
flight
of
her
pet
but
she
ceased
to
search
and
to
call
and
went
away
from
the
cave
then
loki
the
doer
of
good
and
the
doer
of
evil
flew
to
where
iduna
was
sitting
and
spoke
to
her
iduna
when
she
knew
that
one
of
the
dwellers
in
asgard
was
near
wept
with
joy
loki
told
her
what
she
was
to
do
by
the
power
of
a
spell
that
was
given
him
he
was
able
to
change
her
into
the
form
of
a
sparrow
but
before
she
did
this
she
took
the
shining
apples
out
of
her
basket
and
flung
them
into
places
where
the
giant
would
never
find
them
skadi
coming
back
to
the
cave
saw
the
falcon
fly
out
with
the
sparrow
beside
him
she
cried
out
to
her
father
and
the
giant
knew
that
the
falcon
was
loki
and
the
sparrow
was
iduna
he
changed
himself
into
the
form
of
a
mighty
eagle
by
this
time
sparrow
and
falcon
were
out
of
sight
but
thiassi
knowing
that
he
could
make
better
flight
than
they
flew
toward
asgard
soon
he
saw
them
they
flew
with
all
the
power
they
had
but
the
great
wings
of
the
eagle
brought
him
nearer
and
nearer
to
them
the
dwellers
in
asgard
standing
on
the
wall
saw
the
falcon
and
the
sparrow
with
the
great
eagle
pursuing
them
they
knew
who
they
were
loki
and
iduna
with
thiassi
in
pursuit
as
they
watched
the
eagle
winging
nearer
and
nearer
the
dwellers
in
asgard
were
fearful
that
the
falcon
and
the
sparrow
would
be
caught
upon
and
that
iduna
would
be
taken
again
by
thiassi
they
lighted
great
fires
upon
the
wall
knowing
that
loki
would
find
a
way
through
the
fires
bringing
iduna
with
him
but
that
thiassi
would
not
find
a
way
the
falcon
and
the
sparrow
flew
toward
the
fires
loki
went
between
the
flames
and
brought
iduna
with
him
and
thiassi
coming
up
to
the
fires
and
finding
no
way
through
beat
his
wings
against
the
flames
he
fell
down
from
the
wall
and
the
death
that
came
to
him
afterwards
was
laid
to
loki
thus
iduna
was
brought
back
to
asgard
once
again
she
sat
in
the
golden
house
that
opened
to
her
garden
once
again
she
plucked
the
shining
apples
off
the
tree
she
tended
and
once
again
she
gave
them
to
the
dwellers
in
asgard
and
the
dwellers
in
asgard
walked
lightly
again
and
brightness
came
into
their
eyes
and
into
their
cheeks
age
no
more
approached

came
back

who
were
the
gods
and
the
goddesses
and
the
vanir
who
were
the
friends
of
the
gods
and
the
goddesses
were
wroth
with
loki
it
was
no
wonder
they
were
wroth
with
him
for
he
had
let
the
giant
thiassi
carry
off
iduna
and
her
golden
apples
still
it
must
be
told
that
the
show
they
made
of
their
wrath
made
loki
ready
to
do
more
mischief
in
asgard
one
day
he
saw
a
chance
to
do
mischief
that
made
his
heart
rejoice
sif
the
wife
of

lying
asleep
outside

and
how
greatly

prized

because
of
thor
love
here

chance
to

great
mischief

he
took
out

shears
and
he
cut

shining
hair

strand
and
every
tress
she
did
not
waken
while

treasure
was
being
taken
from
her
but
loki
left

when

he
heard

he
stopped
and
then
a
figure
stole
out
from

a
stone
a
veil
covered
her
head
and
thor
scarce
knew
that
this
was
sif

and
thor
saw
that

and
taking
his
wife
hand
in

thor
went
off
to
the
council
house
where
the
gods
and
the
goddesses
were
sif
covered
her
head
with
her
veil
for
she
would
not
have
the
gods
and
goddesses
look
upon
her
shorn
head
but
from
the
anger
in

eyes
all
saw
that
the
wrong

indeed
then
thor
told
of

a
whisper

to
come
before

here
it
is
for
you
to
make
him
and
remember
that
loki
is
cunning
and
able
to
do
many
things
bring
back
to
sif
the
beauty
of
her
golden
hair
then
the
call
of
odin
the
call
that
all
in
asgard
have
to
harken
to
went
through
the
city
of
the
gods
loki
heard
it
and
he
had
to
come
from
his
and
enter
the
house
where
the
gods
held
their
council
and
when
he
looked
on
thor
and
saw
the
rage
that
was
in
his
eyes
and
when
he
looked
on
odin
and
saw
the
sternness
in
the
face
of
the
father
of
the
gods
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
make
amends
for
the
shameful
wrong
he
had
done
to
sif
said
odin
there
is
a
thing
that
you
loki
have
to
do
restore
to
sif
the
beauty
of
her
hair
loki
looked
at
odin
loki
looked
at
thor
and
he
saw
that
what
was
said
would
have
to
be
done
his
quick
mind
searched
to
find
a
way
of
restoring
to
sif
the
beauty
of
her
golden
hair
i
shall
do
as
you
command
odin
he
said
but
before
we
tell
you
of
what
loki
did
to
restore
the
beauty
of
golden
hair
we
must
tell
you
of
the
other
beings
besides
the
gods
and
the
goddesses
who
were
in
the
world
at
the
time
first
there
was
the
vanir
when
the
gods
who
were
called
the
æsir
came
to
the
mountain
on
which
they
built
asgard
they
found
other
beings
there
these
were
not
wicked
and
ugly
like
the
giants
they
were
beautiful
and
friendly
the
vanir
they
were
named
although
they
were
beautiful
and
friendly
the
vanir
had
no
thought
of
making
the
world
more
beautiful
or
more
happy
in
that
way
they
differed
from
the
æsir
who
had
such
a
thought
the
æsir
made
peace
with
them
and
they
lived
together
in
friendship
and
the
vanir
came
to
do
things
that
helped
the
æsir
to
make
the
world
more
beautiful
and
more
happy
freya
whom
the
giant
wanted
to
take
away
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
as
a
reward
for
the
building
of
the
wall
round
asgard
was
of
the
vanir
the
other
beings
of
the
vanir
were
frey
who
was
the
brother
of
freya
and
niörd
who
was
their
father
on
the
earth
below
there
were
other
beings
the
dainty
elves
who
danced
and
fluttered
about
attending
to
the
trees
and
flowers
and
grasses
the
vanir
were
permitted
to
rule
over
the
elves
then
below
the
earth
in
caves
and
hollows
there
was
another
race
the
dwarfs
or
gnomes
little
twisted
creatures
who
were
both
wicked
and
ugly
but
who
were
the
best
craftsmen
in
the
world
in
the
days
when
neither
the
æsir
nor
the
vanir
were
friendly
to
him
loki
used
to
go
down
to
svartheim
the
dwarfs
dwelling
below
the
earth
and
now
that
he
was
commanded
to
restore
to
sif
the
beauty
of
her
hair
loki
thought
of
help
he
might
get
from
the
dwarfs
down
down
through
the
winding
passages
in
the
earth
he
went
and
he
came
at
last
to
where
the
dwarfs
who
were
most
friendly
to
him
were
working
in
their
forges
all
the
dwarfs
were
and
when
he
came
upon
his
friends
he
found
them
working
hammer
and
tongs
beating
metals
into
many
shapes
he
watched
them
for
a
while
and
took
note
of
the
things
they
were
making
one
was
a
spear
so
well
balanced
and
made
that
it
would
hit
whatever
mark
it
was
thrown
at
no
matter
how
bad
the
aim
the
thrower
had
the
other
was
a
boat
that
could
sail
on
any
sea
but
that
could
be
folded
up
so
that
it
would
go
into
one
pocket
the
spear
was
called
gungnir
and
the
boat
was
called
skidbladnir
loki
made
himself
very
agreeable
to
the
dwarfs
praising
their
work
and
promising
them
things
that
only
the
dwellers
in
asgard
could
give
things
that
the
dwarfs
longed
to
possess
he
talked
to
them
till
the
little
ugly
folk
thought
that
they
would
come
to
own
asgard
and
all
that
was
in
it
at
last
loki
said
to
them
have
you
got
a
bar
of
fine
gold
that
you
can
hammer
into
threads
into
threads
so
fine
that
they
will
be
like
the
hair
of
sif
thor
wife
only
the
dwarfs
could
make
a
thing
so
wonderful
ah
there
is
the
bar
of
gold
hammer
it
into
those
fine
threads
and
the
gods
themselves
will
be
jealous
of
your
work
flattered
by
loki
speeches
the
dwarfs
who
were
in
the
forge
took
up
the
bar
of
fine
gold
and
flung
it
into
the
fire
then
taking
it
out
and
putting
it
upon
their
anvil
they
worked
on
the
bar
with
their
tiny
hammers
until
they
beat
it
into
threads
that
were
as
fine
as
the
hairs
of
one
head
but
that
was
not
enough
they
had
to
be
as
fine
as
the
hairs
on
sif
head
and
these
were
finer
than
anything
else
they
worked
on
the
threads
over
and
over
again
until
they
were
as
fine
as
the
hairs
on
sif
head
the
threads
were
as
bright
as
sunlight
and
when
loki
took
up
the
mass
of
worked
gold
it
flowed
from
his
raised
hand
down
on
the
ground
it
was
so
fine
that
it
could
be
put
into
his
palm
and
it
was
so
light
that
a
bird
might
not
feel
its
weight
then
loki
praised
the
dwarfs
more
and
more
and
he
made
more
and
more
promises
to
them
he
charmed
them
all
although
they
were
an
unfriendly
and
a
suspicious
folk
and
before
he
left
them
he
asked
them
for
the
spear
and
the
boat
he
had
seen
them
make
the
spear
gungnir
and
the
boat
skidbladnir
the
dwarfs
gave
him
these
things
though
in
a
while
after
they
wondered
at
themselves
for
giving
them
back
to
asgard
loki
went
he
walked
into
the
council
house
where
the
dwellers
in
asgard
were
gathered
he
met
the
stern
look
in
odin
eyes
and
the
rageful
look
in
thor
eyes
with
smiling
good
humor
off
with
thy
veil
o
sif
he
said
and
when
poor
sif
took
off
her
veil
he
put
upon
her
shorn
head
the
wonderful
mass
of
gold
he
held
in
his
palm
over
her
shoulders
the
gold
fell
fine
soft
and
shining
as
her
own
hair
and
the
æsir
and
the
asyniur
the
gods
and
the
goddesses
and
the
van
and
vana
when
they
saw
sif
head
covered
again
with
the
shining
web
laughed
and
clapped
their
hands
in
gladness
and
the
shining
web
held
to
sif
head
as
if
indeed
it
had
roots
and
was
growing
there
illustration
how
brock
brought
judgment
on
loki
it
was
then
that
loki
with
the
wish
of
making
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
friendly
to
him
once
more
brought
out
the
wonderful
things
he
had
gained
from
the
dwarfs
the
spear
gungnir
and
the
boat
skidbladnir
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
marveled
at
things
so
wonderful
loki
gave
the
spear
as
a
gift
to
odin
and
to
frey
who
was
chief
of
the
vanir
he
gave
the
boat
skidbladnir
all
asgard
rejoiced
that
things
so
wonderful
and
so
helpful
had
been
brought
to
them
and
loki
who
had
made
a
great
show
in
giving
these
gifts
said
boastingly
none
but
the
dwarfs
who
work
for
me
could
make
such
things
there
are
other
dwarfs
but
they
are
as
unhandy
as
they
are
misshapen
the
dwarfs
who
are
my
servants
are
the
only
ones
who
can
make
such
wonders
now
loki
in
his
boastfulness
had
said
a
foolish
thing
there
were
other
dwarfs
besides
those
who
had
worked
for
him
and
one
of
these
was
there
in
asgard
all
unknown
to
loki
he
stood
in
the
shadow
of
odin
seat
listening
to
what
was
being
said
now
he
went
over
to
loki
his
little
unshapely
form
trembling
with
rage
brock
the
most
spiteful
of
all
the
dwarfs
ha
loki
you
boaster
he
roared
you
lie
in
your
words
sindri
my
brother
who
would
scorn
to
serve
you
is
the
best
smith
in
svartheim
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
laughed
to
see
loki
outfaced
by
brock
the
dwarf
in
the
middle
of
his
boastfulness
as
they
laughed
loki
grew
angry
be
silent
dwarf
he
said
your
brother
will
know
about
smith
work
when
he
goes
to
the
dwarfs
who
are
my
friends
and
learns
something
from
them
he
learn
from
the
dwarfs
who
are
your
friends
my
brother
sindri
learn
from
the
dwarfs
who
are
your
friends
brock
roared
in
a
greater
rage
than
before
the
things
you
have
brought
out
of
svartheim
would
not
be
noticed
by
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
if
they
were
put
beside
the
things
that
my
brother
sindri
can
make
sometime
we
will
try
your
brother
sindri
and
see
what
he
can
do
said
loki
try
now
try
now
brock
shouted
i
wager
my
head
against
yours
loki
that
his
work
will
make
the
dwellers
in
asgard
laugh
at
your
boasting
i
will
take
your
wager
said
loki
my
head
against
yours
and
glad
will
i
be
to
see
that
ugly
head
of
yours
off
your
misshapen
shoulders
the
æsir
will
judge
whether
my
brother
work
is
not
the
best
that
ever
came
out
of
svartheim
and
they
will
see
to
it
that
you
will
pay
your
wager
loki
the
head
off
your
shoulders
will
ye
not
sit
in
judgment
o
dwellers
in
asgard
we
will
sit
in
judgment
said
the
æsir
then
still
full
of
rage
brock
the
dwarf
went
down
to
svartheim
and
to
the
place
where
his
brother
sindri
worked
there
was
sindri
in
his
glowing
forge
working
with
bellows
and
anvil
and
hammers
beside
him
and
around
him
masses
of
metal
gold
and
silver
copper
and
iron
brock
told
his
tale
how
he
had
wagered
his
head
against
loki
that
sindri
could
make
things
more
wonderful
than
the
spear
and
the
boat
that
loki
had
brought
into
asgard
you
were
right
in
what
you
said
my
brother
said
sindri
and
you
shall
not
lose
your
head
to
loki
but
the
two
of
us
must
work
at
what
i
am
going
to
forge
it
will
be
your
work
to
keep
the
fire
so
that
it
will
neither
blaze
up
nor
die
down
for
a
single
instant
if
you
can
keep
the
fire
as
i
tell
you
we
will
forge
a
wonder
now
brother
keep
your
hands
upon
the
bellows
and
keep
the
fire
under
your
control
then
into
the
fire
sindri
threw
not
a
piece
of
metal
but
a
pig
skin
brock
kept
his
hands
on
the
bellows
working
it
so
that
the
fire
neither
died
down
nor
blazed
up
for
a
single
instant
and
in
the
glowing
fire
the
pigskin
swelled
itself
into
a
strange
shape
but
brock
was
not
left
to
work
the
bellows
in
peace
in
to
the
forge
flew
a
gadfly
it
lighted
on
brock
hands
and
stung
them
the
dwarf
screamed
with
pain
but
his
hands
still
held
the
bellows
working
it
to
keep
the
fire
steady
for
he
knew
that
the
gadfly
was
loki
and
that
loki
was
striving
to
spoil
sindri
work
again
the
gadfly
stung
his
hands
but
brock
although
his
hands
felt
as
if
they
were
pierced
with
hot
irons
still
worked
the
bellows
so
that
the
fire
did
not
blaze
up
or
die
down
for
a
single
instant
sindri
came
and
looked
into
the
fire
over
the
shape
that
was
rising
there
he
said
words
of
magic
the
gadfly
had
flown
away
and
sindri
bade
his
brother
cease
working
he
took
out
the
thing
that
had
been
shaped
in
the
fire
and
he
worked
over
it
with
his
hammer
it
was
a
wonder
indeed
a
boar
all
golden
that
could
fly
through
the
air
and
that
shed
light
from
its
bristles
as
it
flew
brock
forgot
the
pain
in
his
hands
and
screamed
with
joy
this
is
the
greatest
of
wonders
he
said
the
dwellers
in
asgard
will
have
to
give
the
judgment
against
loki
i
shall
have
loki
head
but
sindri
said
the
boar
golden
bristle
may
not
be
judged
as
great
a
wonder
as
the
spear
gungnir
or
the
boat
skidbladnir
we
must
make
something
more
wonderful
still
work
the
bellows
as
before
brother
and
do
not
let
the
fire
die
down
or
blaze
up
for
a
single
instant
then
sindri
took
up
a
piece
of
gold
that
was
so
bright
it
lightened
up
the
dark
cavern
that
the
dwarfs
worked
in
he
threw
the
piece
of
gold
into
the
fire
then
he
went
to
make
ready
something
else
and
left
brock
to
work
the
bellows
the
gadfly
flew
in
again
brock
did
not
know
it
was
there
until
it
lighted
on
the
back
of
his
neck
it
stung
him
till
brock
felt
the
pain
was
wrenching
him
apart
but
still
he
kept
his
hands
on
the
bellows
working
it
so
that
the
fire
neither
blazed
up
nor
died
down
for
a
single
instant
when
sindri
came
to
look
into
the
fire
brock
was
not
able
to
speak
for
pain
again
sindri
said
magic
words
over
the
gold
that
was
being
smelted
in
the
fire
he
took
it
out
of
the
glow
and
worked
it
over
on
the
then
in
a
while
he
showed
brock
something
that
looked
like
the
circle
of
their
sun
a
splendid
armring
my
brother
he
said
an
armring
for
a
god
right
arm
and
this
ring
has
hidden
wonders
every
ninth
night
eight
rings
like
itself
will
drop
from
this
armring
for
this
is
draupnir
the
ring
of
increase
to
odin
the
father
of
the
gods
the
ring
shall
be
given
said
brock
and
odin
will
have
to
declare
that
nothing
so
wonderful
or
so
profitable
to
the
gods
was
ever
brought
into
asgard
o
loki
cunning
loki
i
shall
have
thy
head
in
spite
of
thy
tricks
be
not
too
hasty
brother
said
sindri
what
we
have
done
so
far
is
good
but
better
still
must
be
the
thing
that
will
make
the
dwellers
in
asgard
give
the
judgment
that
delivers
loki
head
to
thee
work
as
before
brother
and
do
not
let
the
fire
blaze
up
or
die
down
for
a
single
instant
this
time
sindri
threw
into
the
fire
a
bar
of
iron
then
he
went
away
to
fetch
the
hammer
that
would
shape
it
brock
worked
the
bellows
as
before
but
only
his
hands
were
steady
for
every
other
part
of
him
was
trembling
with
expectation
of
the
gadfly
sting
he
saw
the
gadfly
dart
into
the
forge
he
screamed
as
it
flew
round
and
round
him
searching
out
a
place
where
it
might
sting
him
most
fearfully
it
lighted
down
on
his
forehead
just
between
his
eyes
the
first
sting
it
gave
took
the
sight
from
his
eyes
it
stung
again
and
brock
felt
the
blood
flowing
down
darkness
filled
the
cave
brock
tried
to
keep
his
hands
steady
on
the
bellows
but
he
did
not
know
whether
the
fire
was
blazing
up
or
dying
down
he
shouted
and
sindri
hurried
up
sindri
said
the
magic
words
over
the
thing
that
was
in
the
fire
then
he
drew
it
out
an
instant
more
he
said
and
the
work
would
have
been
perfect
but
because
you
let
the
fire
die
down
for
an
instant
the
work
is
not
as
good
as
it
might
have
been
made
he
took
what
was
shaped
in
the
fire
to
the
and
worked
over
it
then
when
eyesight
came
back
to
him
he
saw
a
great
hammer
a
hammer
all
of
iron
the
handle
did
not
seem
to
be
long
enough
to
balance
the
head
this
was
because
the
fire
had
died
down
for
an
instant
while
it
was
being
formed
the
hammer
is
miölnir
said
sindri
and
it
is
the
greatest
of
the
things
that
i
am
able
to
make
all
in
asgard
must
rejoice
to
see
this
hammer
thor
only
will
be
able
to
wield
it
now
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
judgment
that
the
dwellers
in
asgard
will
give
the
dwellers
in
asgard
will
have
to
give
judgment
for
us
brock
cried
out
they
will
have
to
give
judgment
for
us
and
the
head
of
loki
my
tormentor
will
be
given
me
no
more
wonderful
or
more
profitable
gifts
than
these
have
ever
been
brought
into
asgard
sindri
said
thy
head
is
saved
and
thou
wilt
be
able
to
take
the
head
of
loki
who
was
insolent
to
us
bring
it
here
and
we
will
throw
it
into
the
fire
in
the
forge
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
were
seated
in
the
council
house
of
asgard
when
a
train
of
dwarfs
appeared
before
them
brock
came
at
the
head
of
the
train
and
he
was
followed
by
a
band
of
dwarfs
carrying
things
of
great
weight
brock
and
his
attendants
stood
round
the
throne
of
odin
and
hearkened
to
the
words
of
the
father
of
the
gods
we
know
why
you
have
come
into
asgard
from
out
of
svartheim
odin
said
you
have
brought
things
wonderful
and
profitable
to
the
dwellers
in
asgard
let
what
you
have
brought
be
seen
brock
if
they
are
more
wonderful
and
more
useful
than
the
things
loki
has
brought
out
of
svartheim
the
spear
gungnir
and
the
boat
skidbladnir
we
will
give
judgment
for
you
then
brock
commanded
the
dwarfs
who
waited
on
him
to
show
the
dwellers
in
asgard
the
first
of
the
wonders
that
sindri
had
made
they
brought
out
the
boar
golden
bristle
round
and
round
the
council
house
the
boar
flew
leaving
a
track
of
brightness
the
dwellers
in
asgard
said
one
to
the
other
that
this
was
a
wonder
indeed
but
none
would
say
that
the
boar
was
a
better
thing
to
have
in
asgard
than
the
spear
that
would
hit
the
mark
no
matter
how
badly
it
was
flung
or
the
boat
skidbladnir
that
would
sail
on
any
sea
and
that
could
be
folded
up
so
small
that
it
would
fit
in
any
one
pocket
none
would
say
that
golden
bristle
was
better
than
these
wonders
to
frey
who
was
chief
of
the
vanir
brock
gave
the
wondrous
boar
then
the
attending
dwarfs
showed
the
armring
that
was
as
bright
as
the
circle
of
the
sun
all
admired
the
noble
ring
and
when
it
was
told
how
every
ninth
night
this
ring
dropped
eight
rings
of
gold
that
were
like
itself
the
dwellers
in
asgard
spoke
aloud
all
saying
that
draupnir
the
ring
of
increase
was
a
wonder
indeed
hearing
their
voices
raised
brock
looked
triumphantly
at
loki
who
was
standing
there
with
his
lips
drawn
closely
together
to
odin
the
father
of
the
gods
brock
gave
the
noble
armring
then
he
commanded
the
attending
dwarfs
to
lay
before
thor
the
hammer
miölnir
thor
took
the
hammer
up
and
swung
it
around
his
head
as
he
did
so
he
uttered
a
great
cry
and
the
eyes
of
the
dwellers
in
asgard
lightened
up
when
they
saw
thor
with
the
hammer
miölnir
in
his
hands
their
eyes
lightened
up
and
from
their
lips
came
the
cry
this
is
a
wonder
a
wonder
indeed
with
this
hammer
in
his
hand
none
can
withstand
thor
our
champion
no
greater
thing
has
ever
come
into
asgard
than
the
hammer
miölnir
then
odin
the
father
of
the
gods
spoke
from
his
throne
giving
judgment
the
hammer
miölnir
that
the
dwarf
brock
has
brought
into
asgard
is
a
thing
wonderful
indeed
and
profitable
to
the
gods
in
thor
hands
it
can
crush
mountains
and
hurl
the
giant
race
from
the
ramparts
of
asgard
sindri
the
dwarf
has
forged
a
greater
thing
than
the
spear
gungnir
and
the
boat
skidbladnir
there
can
be
no
other
judgment
brock
looked
at
loki
showing
his
gnarled
teeth
now
loki
yield
your
head
yield
your
head
he
cried
do
not
ask
such
a
thing
said
odin
put
any
other
penalty
on
loki
for
mocking
you
and
tormenting
you
make
him
yield
to
you
the
greatest
thing
that
it
is
in
his
power
to
give
not
so
not
so
screamed
brock
you
dwellers
in
asgard
would
shield
one
another
but
what
of
me
loki

the
wager
loki
has
lost
his
head
to
me
let
him
kneel
down
now
till
i
cut
it
off

forward
smiling
with
closed
lips

before
you
dwarf
he
said

my
head
but
be
careful

not
touch
my
neck
i
did
not
bargain
that
you
should
touch
my
neck
if
you
do
i
shall
call
upon
the
dwellers
in
asgard
to
punish
you
brock
drew
back
with
a
snarl
is
this
the
judgment
of
the
gods
he
asked
the
bargain
you
made
brock
said
odin
was
an
evil
one
and
all
its
evil
consequences
you
must
bear
brock
in
a
rage
looked
upon
loki
and
he
saw
that
his
lips
were
smiling
he
stamped
his
feet
and
raged
then
he
went
up
to
loki
and
said
i
may
not
take
your
head
but
i
can
do
something
with
your
lips
that
mock
me
what
would
you
do
dwarf
asked
thor
sew
loki
lips
together
said
brock
so
that
he
can
do
no
more
mischief
with
his
talk
you
dwellers
in
asgard
can
not
forbid
me
to
do
this
down
loki
on
your
knees
before
me
loki
looked
round
on
the
dwellers
in
asgard
and
he
saw
that
their
judgment
was
that
he
must
kneel
before
the
dwarf
he
knelt
down
with
a
frown
upon
his
brow
draw
your
lips
together
loki
said
brock
loki
drew
his
lips
together
while
his
eyes
flashed
fire
with
an
awl
that
he
took
from
his
belt
brock
pierced
loki
lips
he
took
out
a
thong
and
tightened
them
together
then
in
triumph
the
dwarf
looked
on
loki
o
loki
he
said
you
boasted
that
the
dwarfs
who
worked
for
you
were
better
craftsmen
than
sindri
my
brother
your
words
have
been
shown
to
be
lies
and
now
you
can
not
boast
for
a
while
then
brock
the
dwarf
with
great
majesty
walked
out
of
the
council
house
of
asgard
and
the
attending
dwarfs
marched
behind
him
in
procession
down
the
passages
in
the
earth
the
dwarfs
went
singing
the
song
of
brock
triumph
over
loki
and
in
svartheim
it
was
told
forever
after
how
sindri
and
brock
had
prevailed
in
asgard
now
that
loki
lips
were
closed
there
was
peace
and
a
respite
from
mischief
no
one
amongst
the
æsir
or
the
vanir
were
sorry
when
loki
had
to
walk
about
in
silence
with
his
head
bent
low
illustration
how
freya
gained
her
necklace
and
how
her
loved
one
was
lost
to
her
yes
loki
went
through
asgard
silent
and
with
head
bent
and
the
dwellers
in
asgard
said
one
unto
the
other
this
will
teach
loki
to
work
no
more
mischief
they
did
not
know
that
what
loki
had
done
had
sown
the
seeds
of
mischief
and
that
these
seeds
were
to
sprout
up
and
bring
sorrow
to
the
beautiful
vana
freya
to
freya
whom
the
giant
wanted
to
carry
off
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
as
payment
for
his
building
the
wall
around
asgard
freya
had
looked
upon
the
wonders
that
loki
had
brought
into
asgard
the
golden
threads
that
were
sif
hair
and
frey
boar
that
shed
light
from
its
bristles
as
it
flew
the
gleam
of
these
golden
things
dazzled
her
and
made
her
dream
in
the
day
time
and
the
night
time
of
the
wonders
that
she
herself
might
possess
and
often
she
thought
what
wonderful
things
the
three
giant
women
would
give
me
if
i
could
bring
myself
to
go
to
them
on
their
mountaintop
long
ere
this
when
the
wall
around
their
city
was
not
yet
built
and
when
the
gods
had
set
up
only
the
court
with
their
twelve
seats
and
the
hall
that
was
for
odin
and
the
hall
that
was
for
the
goddesses
there
had
come
into
asgard
three
giant
women
they
came
after
the
gods
had
set
up
a
forge
and
had
begun
to
work
metal
for
their
buildings
the
metal
they
worked
was
pure
gold
with
gold
they
built
gladsheim
the
hall
of
odin
and
with
gold
they
made
all
their
dishes
and
household
ware
then
was
the
age
of
gold
and
the
gods
did
not
grudge
gold
to
anyone
happy
were
the
gods
then
and
no
shadow
nor
foreboding
lay
on
asgard
but
after
the
three
giant
women
came
the
gods
began
to
value
gold
and
to
hoard
it
they
played
with
it
no
more
and
the
happy
innocence
of
their
first
days
departed
from
them
at
last
the
three
were
banished
from
asgard
the
gods
turned
their
thoughts
from
the
hoarding
of
gold
and
they
built
up
their
city
and
they
made
themselves
strong
and
now
freya
the
lovely
vanir
bride
thought
upon
the
giant
women
and
on
the
wonderful
things
of
gold
they
had
flashed
through
their
hands
but
not
to
odur
her
husband
did
she
speak
her
thoughts
for
odur
more
than
any
of
the
other
dwellers
in
asgard
was
wont
to
think
on
the
days
of
happy
innocence
before
gold
came
to
be
hoarded
and
valued
odur
would
not
have
freya
go
near
the
mountaintop
where
the
three
had
their
high
seat
but
freya
did
not
cease
to
think
upon
them
and
upon
the
things
of
gold
they
had
why
should
odur
know
i
went
to
them
she
said
to
herself
no
one
will
tell
him
and
what
difference
will
it
make
if
i
go
to
them
and
gain
some
lovely
thing
for
myself
i
shall
not
love
odur
the
less
because
i
go
my
own
way
for
once
then
one
day
she
left
their
palace
leaving
odur
her
husband
playing
with
their
little
child
hnossa
she
left
the
palace
and
went
down
to
the
earth
there
she
stayed
for
a
while
tending
the
flowers
that
were
her
charge
after
a
while
she
asked
the
elves
to
tell
her
where
the
mountain
was
on
which
the
three
giant
women
stayed
the
elves
were
frightened
and
would
not
tell
her
although
she
was
queen
over
them
she
left
them
and
stole
down
into
the
caves
of
the
dwarfs
it
was
they
who
showed
her
the
way
to
the
seat
of
the
giant
women
but
before
they
showed
her
the
way
they
made
her
feel
shame
and
misery
we
will
show
you
the
way
if
you
stay
with
us
here
said
one
of
the
dwarfs
for
how
long
would
you
have
me
stay
said
freya
until
the
cocks
in
svartheim
crow
said
the
dwarfs
closing
round
her
we
want
to
know
what
the
company
of
one
of
the
vanir
is
like
i
will
stay
freya
said
then
one
of
the
dwarfs
reached
up
and
put
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
kissed
her
with
his
ugly
mouth
freya
tried
to
break
away
from
them
but
the
dwarfs
held
her
you
can
not
go
away
from
us
now
until
the
cocks
of
svartheim
crow
they
said
then
one
and
then
another
of
the
dwarfs
pressed
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
they
made
her
sit
down
beside
them
on
the
heaps
of
skins
they
had
when
she
wept
they
screamed
at
her
and
beat
her
one
when
she
would
not
kiss
him
on
the
mouth
bit
her
hands
so
freya
stayed
with
the
dwarfs
until
the
cocks
of
svartheim
crew
they
showed
her
the
mountain
on
the
top
of
which
the
three
banished
from
asgard
had
their
abode
the
giant
women
sat
overlooking
the
world
of
men
what
would
you
have
from
us
wife
of
odur
one
who
was
called
gulveig
said
to
her
alas
now
that
i
have
found
you
i
know
that
i
should
ask
you
for
nought
freya
said
speak
vana
said
the
second
of
the
giant
women
the
third
said
nothing
but
she
held
up
in
her
hands
a
necklace
of
gold
most
curiously
fashioned
how
bright
it
is
freya
said
there
is
shadow
where
you
sit
women
but
the
necklace
you
hold
makes
brightness
now
oh
how
i
should
joy
to
wear
it
it
is
the
necklace
brisingamen
said
the
one
who
was
called
gulveig
it
is
yours
to
wear
wife
of
odur
said
the
one
who
held
it
in
her
hands
freya
took
the
shining
necklace
and
clasped
it
round
her
throat
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
thank
the
giant
women
for
she
saw
that
there
was
evil
in
their
eyes
she
made
reverence
to
them
however
and
she
went
from
the
mountain
on
which
they
sat
overlooking
the
world
of
men
in
a
while
she
looked
down
and
saw
brisingamen
and
her
misery
went
from
her
it
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
ever
made
by
hands
none
of
the
asyniur
and
none
other
of
the
vanir
possessed
a
thing
so
beautiful
it
made
her
more
and
more
lovely
and
odur
she
thought
would
forgive
her
when
he
saw
how
beautiful
and
how
happy
brisingamen
made
her
she
rose
up
from
amongst
the
flowers
and
took
leave
of
the
slight
elves
and
she
made
her
way
into
asgard
all
who
greeted
her
looked
long
and
with
wonder
upon
the
necklace
that
she
wore
and
into
the
eyes
of
the
goddesses
there
came
a
look
of
longing
when
they
saw
brisingamen
but
freya
hardly
stopped
to
speak
to
anyone
as
swiftly
as
she
could
she
made
her
way
to
her
own
palace
she
would
show
herself
to
odur
and
win
his
forgiveness
she
entered
her
shining
palace
and
called
to
him
no
answer
came
her
child
the
little
hnossa
was
on
the
floor
playing
her
mother
took
her
in
her
arms
but
the
child
when
she
looked
on
brisingamen
turned
away
crying
freya
left
hnossa
down
and
searched
again
for
odur
he
was
not
in
any
part
of
their
palace
she
went
into
the
houses
of
all
who
dwelt
in
asgard
asking
for
tidings
of
him
none
knew
where
he
had
gone
to
at
last
freya
went
back
to
their
palace
and
waited
and
waited
for
odur
to
return
but
odur
did
not
come
one
came
to
her
it
was
a
goddess
odin
wife
the
queenly
frigga
you
are
waiting
for
odur
your
husband
frigga
said
ah
let
me
tell
you
odur
will
not
come
to
you
here
he
went
when
for
the
sake
of
a
shining
thing
you
did
what
would
make
him
unhappy
odur
has
gone
from
asgard
and
no
one
knows
where
to
search
for
him
i
will
seek
him
outside
of
asgard
freya
said
she
wept
no
more
but
she
took
the
little
child
hnossa
and
put
her
in
frigga
arms
then
she
mounted
her
car
that
was
drawn
by
two
cats
and
journeyed
down
from
asgard
to
midgard
the
earth
to
search
for
odur
her
husband
year
in
and
year
out
and
over
all
the
earth
freya
went
searching
and
calling
for
the
lost
odur
she
went
as
far
as
the
bounds
of
the
earth
where
she
could
look
over
to
jötunheim
where
dwelt
the
giant
who
would
have
carried
her
off
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
as
payment
for
the
building
of
the
wall
around
asgard
but
in
no
place
from
the
end
of
the
rainbow
bifröst
that
stretched
from
asgard
to
the
earth
to
the
boundary
of
jötunheim
did
she
find
a
trace
of
her
husband
odur
at
last
she
turned
her
car
toward
bifröst
the
rainbow
bridge
that
stretched
from
midgard
the
earth
to
asgard
the
dwelling
of
the
gods
heimdall
the
watcher
for
the
gods
guarded
the
rainbow
bridge
to
him
freya
went
with
a
half
hope
fluttering
in
her
heart
o
heimdall
she
cried
o
heimdall
watcher
for
the
gods
speak
and
tell
me
if
you
know
where
odur
is
odur
is
in
every
place
where
the
searcher
has
not
come
odur
is
in
every
place
that
the
searcher
has
left
those
who
seek
him
will
never
find
odur
said
heimdall
the
watcher
for
the
gods
then
freya
stood
on
bifröst
and
wept
frigga
the
queenly
goddess
heard
the
sound
of
her
weeping
and
came
out
of
asgard
to
comfort
her
ah
what
comfort
can
you
give
me
frigga
cried
freya
what
comfort
can
you
give
me
when
odur
will
never
be
found
by
one
who
searches
for
him
behold
how
your
daughter
the
child
hnossa
has
grown
said
frigga
freya
looked
up
and
saw
a
beautiful
maiden
standing
on
bifröst
the
rainbow
bridge
she
was
young
more
youthful
than
any
of
the
vanir
or
the
asyniur
and
her
face
and
her
form
were
so
lovely
that
all
hearts
became
melted
when
they
looked
upon
her
and
freya
was
comforted
in
her
loss
she
followed
frigga
across
bifröst
the
rainbow
bridge
and
came
once
again
into
the
city
of
the
gods
in
her
own
palace
in
asgard
freya
dwelt
with
hnossa
her
child
still
she
wore
round
her
neck
brisingamen
the
necklace
that
lost
her
odur
but
now
she
wore
it
not
for
its
splendor
but
as
a
sign
of
the
wrong
she
had
done
she
weeps
and
her
tears
become
golden
drops
as
they
fall
on
the
earth
and
by
poets
who
know
her
story
she
is
called
the
beautiful
lady
in
tears
illustration
how
frey
won
gerda
the
giant
maiden
and
how
he
lost
his
magic
sword
frey
chief
of
the
vanir
longed
to
have
sight
of
his
sister
who
had
been
from
asgard
for
so
long
you
must
know
that
this
happened
during
the
time
when
freya
was
wandering
through
the
world
seeking
her
husband
the
lost
odur
now
there
was
in
asgard
a
place
from
which
one
could
overlook
the
world
and
have
a
glimpse
of
all
who
wandered
there
that
place
was
hlidskjalf
odin
lofty
high
up
into
the
blue
of
the
air
that
tower
went
frey
came
to
it
and
he
knew
that
odin
was
not
upon
hlidskjalf
only
the
two
wolves
geri
and
freki
that
crouched
beside
odin
seat
at
the
banquet
were
there
and
they
stood
in
the
way
of
frey
entrance
to
the
tower
but
frey
spoke
to
geri
and
freki
in
the
language
of
the
gods
and
wolves
had
to
let
him
pass
but
as
he
went
up
the
steps
within
the
tower
frey
chief
of
the
vanir
knew
that
he
was
doing
a
fateful
thing
for
none
of
the
high
gods
not
even
thor
the
defender
of
asgard
nor
baldur
the
of
the
gods
had
ever
climbed
to
the
top
of
that
tower
and
seated
themselves
upon
the
seat
but
if
i
could
see
my
sister
once
i
should
be
contented
said
frey
to
himself
and
no
harm
can
come
to
me
if
i
look
out
on
the
world
he
came
to
the
top
of
hlidskjalf
he
seated
himself
on
odin
lofty
seat
he
looked
out
on
the
world
he
saw
midgard
the
world
of
men
with
its
houses
and
towns
its
farms
and
people
beyond
midgard
he
saw
jötunheim
the
realm
of
the
giants
terrible
with
its
dark
mountains
and
its
masses
of
snow
and
ice
he
saw
freya
as
she
went
upon
her
wanderings
and
he
marked
that
her
face
was
turned
toward
asgard
and
that
her
steps
were
leading
toward
the
city
of
the
gods
i
have
contented
myself
by
looking
from
hlidskjalf
said
frey
to
himself
and
no
harm
has
come
to
me
but
even
as
he
spoke
his
gaze
was
drawn
to
a
dwelling
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
ice
and
snow
of
jötunheim
long
he
gazed
upon
that
dwelling
without
knowing
why
he
looked
that
way
then
the
door
of
the
house
was
opened
and
a
giant
maiden
stood
within
the
doorway
frey
gazed
and
gazed
on
her
so
great
was
the
beauty
of
her
face
that
it
was
like
starlight
in
that
dark
land
she
looked
from
the
doorway
of
the
house
and
then
turned
and
went
within
shutting
the
door
frey
sat
on
odin
high
seat
for
long
then
he
went
down
the
steps
of
the
tower
and
passed
by
the
two
wolves
geri
and
freki
that
looked
threateningly
upon
him
he
went
through
asgard
but
he
found
no
one
to
please
him
in
the
city
of
the
gods
that
night
sleep
did
not
come
to
him
for
his
thoughts
were
fixed
upon
the
loveliness
of
the
giant
maid
he
had
looked
upon
and
when
morning
came
he
was
filled
with
loneliness
because
he
thought
himself
so
far
from
her
he
went
to
hlidskjalf
again
thinking
to
climb
the
tower
and
have
sight
of
her
once
more
but
now
the
two
wolves
geri
and
freki
bared
their
teeth
at
him
and
would
not
let
him
pass
although
he
spoke
to
them
again
in
the
language
of
the
gods
he
went
and
spoke
to
wise
niörd
his
father
she
whom
you
have
seen
my
son
said
niörd
is
gerda
the
daughter
of
the
giant
gymer
you
must
give
over
thinking
of
her
your
love
for
her
would
be
an
ill
thing
for
you
why
should
it
be
an
ill
thing
for
me
frey
asked
because
you
would
have
to
give
that
which
you
prize
most
for
the
sake
of
coming
to
her
that
which
i
prize
most
said
frey
is
my
magic
sword
you
will
have
to
give
your
magic
sword
said
his
father
the
wise
niörd
i
will
give
it
said
frey
loosening
his
magic
sword
from
his
belt
bethink
thee
my
son
said
niörd
if
thou
givest
thy
sword
what
weapon
wilt
thou
have
on
the
day
of
ragnarök
when
the
giants
will
make
war
upon
the
gods
frey
did
not
speak
but
he
thought
the
day
of
ragnarök
was
far
off
i
can
not
live
without
gerda
he
said
as
he
turned
away
there
was
one
in
asgard
who
was
called
skirnir
he
was
a
venturesome
being
who
never
cared
what
he
said
or
did
to
no
one
else
but
skirnir
could
frey
bring
himself
to
tell
of
the
trouble
that
had
fallen
on
him
the
trouble
that
was
the
punishment
for
his
placing
himself
on
the
seat
of
the
skirnir
laughed
when
he
heard
frey
tale
thou
a
van
in
love
with
a
maid
of
jötunheim
this
is
fun
indeed
will
ye
make
a
marriage
of
it
would
that
i
might
even
speak
to
her
or
send
a
message
of
love
to
her
said
frey
but
i
may
not
leave
my
watch
over
the
elves
and
if
i
should
take
a
message
to
gerda
said
skirnir
the
venturesome
what
would
my
reward
be
my
boat
skidbladnir
or
my
boar
golden
bristle
said
frey
no
no
said
skirnir
i
want
something
to
go
by
my
side
i
want
something
to
use
in
my
hand
give
me
the
magic
sword
you
own
frey
thought
upon
what
his
father
said
that
he
would
be
left
weaponless
on
the
day
of
ragnarök
when
the
giants
would
make
war
upon
the
gods
and
when
asgard
would
be
endangered
he
thought
upon
this
and
drew
back
from
skirnir
and
for
a
while
he
remained
in
thought
and
all
the
time
skirnir
was
laughing
at
him
out
of
his
wide
mouth
and
his
blue
eyes
then
frey
said
to
himself
the
day
of
ragnarök
is
far
off
and
i
can
not
live
without
gerda
he
drew
the
magic
sword
from
his
belt
and
he
placed
it
in
hand
i
give
you
my
sword
skirnir
he
said
take
my
message
to
gerda
gymer
daughter
show
her
this
gold
and
these
precious
jewels
and
say
i
love
her
and
that
i
claim
her
love
i
shall
bring
the
maid
to
you
said
skirnir
the
venturesome
but
how
wilt
thou
get
to
jötunheim
said
frey
suddenly
remembering
how
dark
the
giants
land
was
and
how
terrible
were
the
approaches
to
it
oh
with
a
good
horse
and
a
good
sword
one
can
get
anywhere
said
skirnir
my
horse
is
a
mighty
horse
and
you
have
given
me
your
sword
of
magic
tomorrow
i
shall
make
the
journey
skirnir
rode
across
bifröst
the
rainbow
bridge
laughing
out
of
his
wide
mouth
and
his
blue
eyes
at
heimdall
the
warder
of
the
bridge
to
asgard
his
mighty
horse
trod
the
earth
of
midgard
and
swam
the
river
that
divides
midgard
the
world
of
men
from
jötunheim
the
realm
of
the
giants
he
rode
on
heedlessly
and
recklessly
as
he
did
all
things
then
out
of
the
iron
forests
came
the
monstrous
wolves
of
jötunheim
to
tear
and
devour
him
and
his
mighty
horse
it
was
well
for
skirnir
that
he
had
in
his
belt
frey
magic
sword
its
edge
slew
and
its
gleam
frighted
the
monstrous
beasts
on
and
on
skirnir
rode
on
his
mighty
horse
then
he
came
to
a
wall
of
fire
no
other
horse
but
his
mighty
horse
could
go
through
it
skirnir
rode
through
the
fire
and
came
to
the
dale
in
which
was
gymer
dwelling
and
now
he
was
before
the
house
that
frey
had
seen
gerda
enter
on
the
day
when
he
had
climbed
hlidskjalf
odin
the
mighty
hounds
that
guarded
gymer
dwelling
came
and
bayed
around
him
but
the
gleam
of
the
magic
sword
kept
them
away
skirnir
backed
his
horse
to
the
door
and
made
his
horse
hooves
strike
against
it
gymer
was
in
the
feast
hall
drinking
with
his
giant
friends
and
he
did
not
hear
the
baying
of
the
hounds
nor
the
clatter
that
skirnir
made
before
the
door
but
gerda
sat
spinning
with
her
maidens
in
the
hall
who
comes
to
gymer
door
she
said
a
warrior
upon
a
mighty
horse
said
one
of
the
maidens
even
though
he
be
an
enemy
and
one
who
slew
my
brother
yet
shall
we
open
the
door
to
him
and
give
him
a
cup
of
gymer
mead
said
gerda
one
of
the
maidens
opened
the
door
and
skirnir
entered
gymer
dwelling
he
knew
gerda
amongst
her
maidens
he
went
to
her
and
showed
her
the
rich
gold
and
the
precious
jewels
that
he
had
brought
from
frey
these
are
for
you
fairest
gerda
he
said
if
you
will
give
your
love
to
frey
the
chief
of
the
vanir
show
your
gold
and
jewels
to
other
maidens
said
gerda
gold
and
jewels
will
never
bring
me
to
give
my
love
then
skirnir
the
venturesome
the
heedless
of
his
words
drew
the
magic
sword
from
his
belt
and
held
it
above
her
give
your
love
to
frey
who
has
given
me
this
sword
he
said
or
meet
your
death
by
the
edge
of
it
gerda
gymer
daughter
only
laughed
at
the
reckless
skirnir
make
the
daughters
of
men
fearful
by
the
sharpness
of
frey
sword
she
said
but
do
not
try
to
frighten
a
giant
daughter
with
it
then
skirnir
the
reckless
the
heedless
of
his
words
made
the
magic
sword
flash
before
her
eyes
while
he
cried
out
in
a
terrible
voice
saying
a
spell
over
her
gerda
i
will
curse
thee
yes
with
this
magic
blade
i
shall
touch
thee
such
is
its
power
that
like
a
thistle
withered
leave
thee
like
a
thistle
the
wind
strips
from
the
roof
hearing
these
terrible
words
and
the
strange
hissings
of
the
magic
sword
gerda
threw
herself
on
the
ground
crying
out
for
pity
but
skirnir
stood
above
her
and
the
magic
sword
flashed
and
hissed
over
her
skirnir
sang
more
ugly
i
leave
thee
than
maid
ever
was
thou
wilt
be
mocked
at
by
men
and
by
giants
a
dwarf
only
will
wed
thee
now
on
this
instant
with
this
blade
i
shall
touch
thee
and
leave
thee
bespelled
she
lifted
herself
on
her
knees
and
cried
out
to
skirnir
to
spare
her
from
the
spell
of
the
magic
sword
only
if
thou
wilt
give
thy
love
to
frey
said
skirnir
i
will
give
my
love
to
him
said
gerda
now
put
up
thy
magic
sword
and
drink
a
cup
of
mead
and
depart
from
gymer
dwelling
i
will
not
drink
a
cup
of
your
mead
nor
shall
i
depart
from
dwelling
until
you
yourself
say
that
you
will
meet
and
speak
with
frey
i
will
meet
and
speak
with
him
said
gerda
when

with
him
asked
skirnir
in
the
wood
of
barri
nine
nights
from
this
let
him
come
and
meet
me
there
then
skirnir
put
up
his
magic
sword
and
drank
the
cup
of
mead
that
gerda
gave
him
he
rode
from
gymer
house
laughing
aloud
at
having
won
gerda
for
frey
and
so
making
the
magic
sword
his
own
for
ever
skirnir
the
venturesome
the
heedless
of
his
words
riding
across
bifröst
on
his
mighty
horse
found
frey
standing
waiting
for
him
beside
heimdall
the
warder
of
the
bridge
to

dost
dismount
from
thine
horse

wood
said
skirnir
he
looked
at
him
laughing
out
of
his
wide
mouth
and
his
blue
eyes
but
frey
turned
away
saying
to
himself

live
through
nine
long
days

indeed
were
these
days
for
frey
but
the
ninth
day
came
and
in
the
evening
frey
went
to
barri
wood
and
there
he
met
gerda
the
giant
maid
she
was
as
fair
as
when
he
had
seen
her
before
the
door
of
house
and
when
she
saw
frey
so
tall
and
noble
looking
the
daughter
was
glad
that
skirnir
the
venturesome
had
made
her
promise
to
come
to

of
gold

was
settled
that

waiting
to

said
skadi
fixing
her
eyes
on
baldur
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
dwellers
in
asgard
they
put
a
bandage
round
her
eyes
and
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
seat
in
a
half
circle
around
as
she
went
by
she
stooped
over
each
and
laid
hands
upon
their
feet
at
last
she
came
to
one
whose
feet
were
so
finely
formed
that
she
felt
sure
it
was
baldur
she
stood
up
and
said
this
is
the
one
that
skadi
chooses
for
her
husband
then
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
laughed
more
and
more
they
took
the
bandage
off
her
eyes
and
she
saw
not
baldur
the
beautiful
but
niörd
the
father
of
frey
but
as
skadi
looked
more
and
more
on
niörd
she
became
more
and
more
contented
with
her
choice
for

strong
and
he
was
noble
looking
these
two
niörd
and
skadi
went
first
to
live
in
niörd
palace
by
the
sea
but
the
coming
of
the
sea
mew
would
waken
skadi
too
early
in
the
morning
and
she
drew
her
husband
to
the
mountaintop
where
she
was
more
at
home
he
would
not
live
long
away
from
the
sound
of
the
sea
back
and
forward
between
the
mountain
and
the
sea
skadi
and
niörd
went
but
gerda
stayed
in
asgard
with
frey
her
husband
and
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
came
to
love
greatly
gerda
the
giant
maid
illustration
heimdall
and
little
hnossa
how
all
things
came
to
be
hnossa
the
child
of
freya
and
the
lost
odur
was
the
youngest
of
all
the
dwellers
in
asgard
and
because
it
had
been
prophesied
that
the
child
would
bring
her
father
and
her
mother
together
little
hnossa
was
often
taken
without
the
city
of
the
gods
to
stand
by
bifröst
the
rainbow
bridge
so
that
she
might
greet
odur
if
his
steps
turned
toward
asgard
in
all
the
palaces
of
the
city
of
the
gods
little
hnossa
was
made
welcome
in
fensalir
the
halls
of
mists
where
frigga
the
wife
of
odin
sat
spinning
with
golden
threads
in
breidablik
where
baldur
the
well
beloved
lived
with
his
fair
wife
the
young
nanna
in
bilskirnir
the
winding
house
where
thor
and
sif
lived
and
in
own
palace
valaskjalf
that
was
all
roofed
over
with
silver
shields
the
greatest
of
all
the
palaces
was
gladsheim
that
was
built
by
the
wood
glasir
here
the
banquets
of
the
gods
were
held
often
little
hnossa
looked
within
and
saw
odin
seated
at
the
banquet
table
with
a
mantle
of
blue
over
him
and
a
shining
helmet
shaped
like
an
eagle
upon
his
head
odin
would
sit
there
not
eating
at
all
but
drinking
the
wine
of
the
gods
and
taking
the
food
off
the
table
and
giving
it
to
geri
and
freki
the
two
wolves
that
crouched
beside
his
seat
she
loved
to
go
outside
the
great
gate
and
stay
beside
heimdall
the
warder
of
the
rainbow
bridge
there
when
there
was
no
one
crossing
that
she
might
watch
she
would
sit
beside
heimdall
and
listen
to
the
wonders
that
he
spoke
of
heimdall
held
in
his
hands
the
horn
that
was
called
the
gialarhorn
he
would
sound
it
to
let
the
dwellers
in
asgard
know
that
one
was
crossing
the
rainbow
bridge
and
heimdall
told
little
hnossa
how
he
had
trained
himself
to
hear
the
grasses
grow
and
how
he
could
see
all
around
him
for
a
hundred
miles
he
could
see
in
the
night
as
well
as
the
day
he
never
slept
he
had
nine
mothers
he
told
hnossa
and
he
fed
on
the
strength
of
the
earth
and
the
cold
sea
as
she
sat
beside
him
day
after
day
heimdall
would
tell
little
hnossa
how
all
things
began
he
had
lived
from
the
beginning
of
time
and
he
knew
all
things
before
asgard
was
built
he
said
and
before
odin
lived
earth
and
sea
and
sky
were
all
mixed
together
what
was
then
was
the
chasm
of
chasms
in
the
north
there
was
niflheim
the
place
of
deadly
cold
in
the
south
there
was
muspelheim
the
land
of
fire
in
niflheim
there
was
a
cauldron
called
hveigelmer
that
poured
out
twelve
rivers
that
flowed
into
the
chasm
of
chasms
ginnungagap
the
chasm
of
chasms
filled
up
with
ice
for
the
waters
of
the
rivers
froze
as
they
poured
into
it
from
muspelheim
came
clouds
of
fire
that
turned
the
ice
into
thick
mists
the
mists
fell
down
again
in
drops
of
dew
and
from
these
drops
were
formed
ymir
the
ancient
giant
ymir
the
ancient
giant
traveled
along
by
the
twelve
rivers
until
he
came
to
where
another
living
form
was
standing
in
the
mists
this
was
a
giant
cow
audhumla
was
the
name
of
that
cow
ymir
lay
down
beside
her
and
drank
her
milk
and
on
the
milk
she
gave
him
he
lived
other
beings
were
formed
out
of
the
dew
that
fell
to
the
ground
they
were
the
daughters
of
the
frost
and
ymir
the
ancient
giant
married
one
and
their
children
were
the
giants
one
day
ymir
saw
audhumla
breathe
upon
a
cliff
of
ice
and
lick
with
her
tongue
the
place
she
breathed
on
as
her
tongue
went
over
and
over
the
place
he
saw
that
a

it
was
not
like
a
form
it
was
more
shapely
and
more
beautiful
a
head
appeared
in
the
cliff
and
golden
hair
fell
over
the
ice
as
ymir
looked
upon
the
being
that
was
being
formed
he
hated
him
for
his
beauty
audhumla
the
giant
cow
went
on
licking
the
place
where
she
had
breathed
at
last
a
man
completely
formed
stepped
from
the
cliff
ymir
the
ancient
giant
hated
him
so
much
that
he
would
have
slain
him
then
and
there
but
he
knew
that
if
he
did
this
audhumla
would
feed
him
no
more
with
her
milk
bur
was
the
name
of
the
man
who
was
formed
in
the
ice
cliff
bur
the
first
of
the
heroes
he
too
lived
on
the
milk
of
audhumla
he
married
a
daughter
of
the
ancient
giant
and
he
had
a
son
but
ymir
and
sons
hated
bur
and
the
time
came
at
last
when
they
were
able
to
kill
him
and
now
there
was
war
between
ymir
and
ymir
sons
and
the
son
and
son
sons
of
bur
odin
was
the
son
of
bur
son
odin
brought
all
his
brothers
together
and
they
were
able
to
destroy
ymir
and
all
his
brood
all
except
one
so
huge
was
ymir
that
when
he
was
slain
his
blood
poured
out
in
such
a
mighty
flood
that
his
sons
were
all
drowned
in
it
all
except
bergelmir
who
was
in
a
boat
with
his
wife
when
the
flood
came
and
who
floated
away
on
the
flood
to
the
place
that
we
now
call
jötunheim
the
realm
of
the
giants
now
odin
and
his
sons
took
the
body
of
ymir
the
vastest
body
that
ever
was
and
they
flung
it
into
the
chasm
of
chasms
filling
up
all
the
hollow
places
with
it
they
dug
the
bones
out
of
the
body
and
they
piled
them
up
as
the
mountains
they
took
the
teeth
out
and
they
made
them
into
the
rocks
they
took
the
hair
of
ymir
and
they
made
it
into
the
forests
of
trees
they
took
his
eyebrows
and
formed
them
into
the
place
where
men
now
dwell
midgard
and
out
of
ymir
hollow
skull
they
made
the
sky
and
odin
and
his
sons
and
brothers
did
more
than
this
they
took
the
sparks
and
the
clouds
of
flame
that
blew
from
muspelheim
and
they
made
them
into
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
all
the
stars
that
are
in
the
sky
odin
found
a
dusky
giantess
named
night
whose
son
was
called
day
and
he
gave
both
of
them
horses
to
drive
across
the
sky
night
drove
a
horse
that
is
named
hrimfaxe
frosty
mane
and
day
drove
a
horse
that
is
named
skinfaxe
shining
mane
from
hrimfaxe
bit
fall
the
drops
that
make
the
dew
upon
the
earth
then
odin
and
his
sons
made
a
race
of
men
and
women
and
gave
them
midgard
to
live
in
ugly
dwarfs
had
grown
up
and
had
spread
themselves
over
the
earth
these
odin
made
go
live
in
the
hollow
places
beneath
the
earth
the
elves
he
let
stay
on
the
earth
but
he
gave
them
the
tasks
of
tending
the
streams
and
the
grasses
and
the
flowers
and
with
the
vanir
he
made
peace
after
a
war
had
been
waged
taking
niörd
from
them
for
a
hostage
bergelmir
the
giant
who
escaped
drowning
in
ymir
blood
had
sons
and
daughters
in
jötunheim
they
hated
odin
and
his
sons
and
strove
against
them
when
odin
lighted
up
the
world
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
they
were
very
wroth
and
they
found
two
of
the
fiercest
of
the
mighty
wolves
of
jötunheim
and
set
them
to
follow
them
and
still
the
sun
and
the
moon
sol
and
mani
are
followed
by
the
wolves
of
jötunheim
such
wonders
did
heimdall
with
the
golden
teeth
tell
hnossa
the
youngest
of
the
dwellers
in
asgard
often
the
child
stayed
with
him
by
the
rainbow
bridge
and
saw
the
gods
pass
to
and
from
midgard
thor
with
his
crown
of
stars
with
the
great
hammer
miölnir
in
his
hands
with
the
gloves
of
iron
that
he
used
when
he
grasped
miölnir
thor
in
his
chariot
drawn
by
two
goats
and
wearing
the
belt
that
doubled
his
strength
frigga
with
her
dress
of
falcon
feathers
flying
swiftly
as
a
bird
odin
himself
riding
upon
sleipner
his
steed
clad
all
in
golden
armor
with
his
golden
helmet
shaped
like
an
eagle
upon
his
head
and
with
his
spear
gungnir
in
his
hand
heimdall
kept
his
horn
in
the
branch
of
a
great
tree
this
tree
was
called
ygdrassil
he
told
little
hnossa
and
it
was
a
wonder
to
gods
and
men
no
one
knows
of
a
time
when
ygdrassil
was
not
growing
and
all
are
afraid
to
speak
of
the
time
when
it
will
be
destroyed
ygdrassil
has
three
roots
one
goes
deep
under
midgard
another
goes
deep
under
jötunheim
and
the
third
grows
above
asgard
over
odin
hall
a
branch
of
ygdrassil
grows
and
it
is
called
the
peace
bough
you
see
ygdrassil
little
hnossa
but
you
do
not
know
all
the
wonders
of
it
far
up
in
its
branches
four
stags
graze
they
shake
from
their
horns
the
water
that
falls
as
rain
upon
the
earth
on
the
topmost
branch
of
ygdrassil
the
branch
that
is
so
high
that
the
gods
themselves
can
hardly
see
it
there
is
an
eagle
that
knows
all
things
upon
the
beak
of
this
eagle
a
hawk
is
perched
a
hawk
that
sees
what
the
eyes
of
the
eagle
may
not
see
the
root
of
ygdrassil
that
is
in
midgard
goes
deep
down
to
the
place
of
the
dead
here
there
is
an
evil
dragon
named
nidhögg
that
gnaws
constantly
at
the
root
striving
to
destroy
ygdrassil
the
tree
of
trees
and
ratatösk
the
squirrel
of
mischief
behold
him
now
runs
up
and
down
ygdrassil
making
trouble
between
the
eagle
above
and
the
dragon
below
he
goes
to
tell
the
dragon
how
the
eagle
is
bent
upon
tearing
him
to
pieces
and
he
goes
back
to
tell
the
eagle
how
the
dragon
plans
to
devour
him
the
stories
that
he
brings
to
nidhögg
make
that
evil
dragon
more
fierce
to
destroy
ygdrassil
the
tree
of
trees
so
that
he
may
come
upon
the
eagle
and
devour
him
there
are
two
wells
by
the
roots
of
ygdrassil
and
one
is
above
and
one
is
below
one
is
beside
the
root
that
grows
in
jötunheim
this
is
a
well
of
knowledge
and
it
is
guarded
by
old
mimir
the
wise
whoever
drinks
out
of
this
well
knows
of
all
the
things
that
will
come
to
be
the
other
well
is
by
the
root
that
grows
above
asgard
no
one
may
drink
out
of
this
well
the
three
sisters
that
are
the
holy
norns
guard
it
and
they
take
the
white
water
from
it
to
water
ygdrassil
that
the
tree
of
life
may
keep
green
and
strong
this
well
little
hnossa
is
called
well
and
little
hnossa
heard
that
by
urda
well
there
were
two
beautiful
white
swans
they
made
a
music
that
the
dwellers
in
asgard
often
heard
but
hnossa
was
too
young
to
hear
the
music
that
was
made
by
the
swans
of
urda
well
illustration
the
forebodings
how
he
leaves
asgard
two
ravens
had
odin
hugin
and
munin
were
their
names
they
flew
through
all
the
worlds
every
day
and
coming
back
to
asgard
they
would
light
on
odin
shoulders
and
tell
him
of
all
the
things
they
had
seen
and
heard
and
once
a
day
passed
without
the
ravens
coming
back
then
odin
standing
on
the
hlidskjalf
said
to
himself
i
fear
me
for
hugin
lest
he
come
not
back
but
i
watch
more
for
munin
a
day
passed
and
the
ravens
flew
back
they
sat
one
on
each
of
his
shoulders
then
did
the
go
into
the
council
hall
that
was
beside
glasir
the
wood
that
had
leaves
of
gold
and
harken
to
what
hugin
and
munin
had
to
tell
him
they
told
him
only
of
shadows
and
forebodings
odin
did
not
speak
to
the
dwellers
in
asgard
of
the
things
they
told
him
but
frigga
his
queen
saw
in
his
eyes
the
shadows
and
forebodings
of
things
to
come
and
when
he
spoke
to
her
about
these
things
she
said
do
not
strive
against
what
must
take
place
let
us
go
to
the
holy
norns
who
sit
by
urda
well
and
see
if
the
shadows
and
the
forebodings
will
remain
when
you
have
looked
into
their
eyes
and
so
it
came
that
odin
and
the
gods
left
asgard
and
came
to
well
where
under
the
great
root
of
ygdrassil
the
three
norns
sat
with
the
two
fair
swans
below
them
odin
went
and
tyr
the
great
swordsman
and
baldur
the
most
beautiful
and
the
of
the
gods
and
thor
with
his
hammer
a
rainbow
bridge
went
from
asgard
the
city
of
the
gods
to
midgard
the
world
of
men
but
another
rainbow
bridge
more
beautiful
and
more
tremulous
still
went
from
asgard
to
that
root
of
ygdrassil
under
which
was
urda
well
this
rainbow
bridge
was
seldom
seen
by
men
and
where
the
ends
of
the
two
rainbows
came
together
heimdall
stood
heimdall
with
the
golden
teeth
the
watcher
for
the
gods
and
the
keeper
of
the
way
to
urda
well
open
the
gate
heimdall
said
the
open
the
gate
for
today
the
gods
would
visit
the
holy
norns
without
a
word
heimdall
opened
wide
the
gate
that
led
to
that
bridge
more
colored
and
more
tremulous
than
any
rainbow
seen
from
earth
then
did
odin
and
tyr
and
baldur
step
out
on
the
bridge
thor
followed
but
before
his
foot
was
placed
on
the
bridge
heimdall
laid
his
hand
upon
him
the
others
may
go
but
you
may
not
go
that
way
thor
said
heimdall
what
would
you
heimdall
hold
me
back
said
thor
yes
for
i
am
keeper
of
the
way
to
the
norns
said
heimdall
you
with
the
mighty
hammer
you
carry
are
too
weighty
for
this
way
the
bridge
i
guard
would
break
under
you
thor
with
the
hammer
nevertheless
i
will
go
visit
the
norns
with
odin
and
my
comrades
said
thor
but
not
this
way
thor
said
heimdall
i
will
not
let
the
bridge
be
broken
under
the
weight
of
you
and
your
hammer
leave
your
hammer
here
with
me
if
you
would
go
this
way
no
no
said
thor
i
will
not
leave
in
any
one
charge
the
hammer
that
defends
asgard
and
i
may
not
be
turned
back
from
going
with
odin
and
my
comrades
there
is
another
way
to
urda
well
said
heimdall
behold
these
two
great
cloud
rivers
körmt
and
ermt
canst
thou
wade
through
them
they
are
cold
and
suffocating
but
they
will
bring
thee
to
urda
well
where
sit
the
three
holy
norns
thor
looked
out
on
the
two
great
rolling
rivers
of
cloud
it
was
a
bad
way
for
one
to
go
cold
and
suffocating
yet
if
he
went
that
way
he
could
keep
on
his
shoulder
the
hammer
which
he
would
not
leave
in
another
charge
he
stept
out
into
the
cloud
river
that
flowed
by
the
rainbow
bridge
and
with
his
hammer
upon
his
shoulder
he
went
struggling
on
to
the
other
river
odin
tyr
and
baldur
were
beside
urda
well
when
thor
came
struggling
out
of
the
cloud
river
wet
and
choking
but
with
his
hammer
still
upon
his
shoulder
there
stood
tyr
upright
and
handsome
leaning
on
his
sword
that
was
inscribed
all
over
with
magic
runes
there
stood
baldur
smiling
with
his
head
bent
as
he
listened
to
the
murmur
of
the
two
fair
swans
and
there
stood
odin
clad
in
his
blue
cloak
fringed
with
golden
stars
without

and
with
no

in
his

the
three

ancient
and
with
white

verdandi
was
beautiful
while

urda
verdandi
and
skulda
they
knew
the

the
whole
of

and
the
whole
of
the
future
odin
looking
on
them
saw
into
the
eyes
of
skulda
even
long
long
he
stood
looking
on
the
norns
with
the
eyes
of
a
god
while
the
others
listened
to
the
murmur
of
the
swans
and
the
falling
of
the
leaves
of
ygdrassil
into
urda
well
looking
into
their

odin
saw
the
shadows
and
forebodings
that
hugin
and
munin
told

and
now

they
were
frigga

and
thor

then
she
drew

his

no

wearing
his
golden

and
his
and
without

and
now
as

then
vafthrudner

and
many
went

strive
to
gain
wisdom
from
him
but
those
who
went
to
him
had
to
answer
the
riddles
vafthrudner
asked
and
if
they
failed
to

the
giant
took

i
would
strive
to

from

the
giant
laughed
showing
his
teeth
ho
ho
he
said

for
a
game
with
thee

the
stakes

head
to

question

and
if

from
jötunheim

name

river

odin
ifling
that
is
dead
cold
yet
never
frozen
thou
hast
answered
rightly
o
wanderer
said
the
giant
but
thou
hast
still
to
answer
other
questions
what
are
the
names
of
the
horses
that
day
and
night
drive
across
the
sky
skinfaxe
and
hrimfaxe
odin
answered
vafthrudner
was
startled
to
hear
one
say
the
names
that
were
known
only
to
the
gods
and
to
the
wisest
of
the
giants
there
was
only
one
question
now
that
he
might
ask
before
it
came
to
the
stranger
turn
to
ask
him
questions
tell
me
said
vafthrudner
what
is
the
name
of
the
plain
on
which
the
last
battle
will
be
fought
the
plain
of
vigard
said
odin
the
plain
that
is
a
hundred
miles
long
and
a
hundred
miles
across
it
was
now
odin
turn
to
ask
vafthrudner
questions
what
will
be
the
last
words
that
odin
will
whisper
into
the
ear
of
baldur
his
dear
son
he
asked
very
startled
was
the
giant
vafthrudner
at
that
question
he
sprang
to
the
ground
and
looked
at
the
stranger
keenly
only
odin
knows
what
his
last
words
to
baldur
will
be
he
said
and
only
odin
would
have
asked
that
question
thou
art
odin
o
wanderer
and
thy
question
i
can
not
answer
then
said
odin
if
thou
wouldst
keep
thy
head
answer
me
this
what
price
will
mimir
ask
for
a
draught
from
the
well
of
wisdom
that
he
guards
he
will
ask
thy
right
eye
as
a
price
o
odin
said
vafthrudner
will
he
ask
no
less
a
price
than
that
said
odin
he
will
ask
no
less
a
price
many
have
come
to
him
for
a
draught
from
the
well
of
wisdom
but
no
one
yet
has
given
the
price
mimir
asks
i
have
answered
thy
question
o
odin
now
give
up
thy
claim
to
my
head
and
let
me
go
on
my
way
i
give
up
my
claim
to
thy
head
said
odin
then
vafthrudner
the
wisest
of
the
giants
went
on
his
way
riding
on
his
great
stag
it
was
a
terrible
price
that
mimir
would
ask
for
a
draught
from
the
well
of
wisdom
and
very
troubled
was
odin
when
it
was
revealed
to
him
his
right
eye
for
all
time
to
be
without
the
sight
of
his
right
eye
almost
he
would
have
turned
back
to
asgard
giving
up
his
quest
for
wisdom
he
went
on
turning
neither
to
asgard
nor
to
mimir
well
and
when
he
went
toward
the
south
he
saw
muspelheim
where
stood
surtur
with
the
flaming
sword
a
terrible
figure
who
would
one
day
join
the
giants
in
their
war
against
the
gods
and
when
he
turned
north
he
heard
the
roaring
of
the
cauldron
hvergelmer
as
it
poured
itself
out
of
niflheim
the
place
of
darkness
and
dread
and
odin
knew
that
the
world
must
not
be
left
between
surtur
who
would
destroy
it
with
fire
and
niflheim
that
would
gather
it
back
to
darkness
and
nothingness
he
the
eldest
of
the
gods
would
have
to
win
the
wisdom
that
would
help
to
save
the
world
and
so
with
his
face
stern
in
front
of
his
loss
and
pain
odin
turned
and
went
toward
mimir
well
it
was
under
the
great
root
of
ygdrassil
the
root
that
grew
out
of
jötunheim
and
there
sat
mimir
the
guardian
of
the
well
of
wisdom
with
his
deep
eyes
bent
upon
the
deep
water
and
mimir
who
had
drunk
every
day
from
the
well
of
wisdom
knew
who
it
was
that
stood
before
him
hail
odin
eldest
of
the
gods
he
said
then
odin
made
reverence
to
mimir
the
wisest
of
the
world
beings
i
would
drink
from
your
well
mimir
he
said
there
is
a
price
to
be
paid
all
who
have
come
here
to
drink
have
shrunk
from
paying
that
price
will
you
eldest
of
the
gods
pay
it
i
will
not
shrink
from
the
price
that
has
to
be
paid
mimir
said
odin
then
drink
said
mimir
he
filled
up
a
great
horn
with
water
from
the
well
and
gave
it
to
odin
odin
took
the
horn
in
both
his
hands
and
drank
and
drank
and
as
he
drank
all
the
future
became
clear
to
him
he
saw
all
the
sorrows
and
troubles
that
would
fall
upon
men
and
gods
but
he
saw
too
why
the
sorrows
and
troubles
had
to
fall
and
he
saw
how
they
might
be
borne
so
that
gods
and
men
by
being
noble
in
the
days
of
sorrow
and
trouble
would
leave
in
the
world
a
force
that
one
day
a
day
that
was
far
off
indeed
would
destroy
the
evil
that
brought
terror
and
sorrow
and
despair
into
the
world
then
when
he
had
drunk
out
of
the
great
horn
that
mimir
had
given
him
he
put
his
hand
to
his
face
and
he
plucked
out
his
right
eye
terrible
was
the
pain
that
odin
endured
but
he
made
no
groan
nor
moan
he
bowed
his
head
and
put
his
cloak
before
his
face
as
mimir
took
the
eye
and
let
it
sink
deep
deep
into
the
water
of
the
well
of
wisdom
and
there
the
eye
of
odin
stayed
shining
up
through
the
water
a
sign
to
all
who
came
to
that
place
of
the
price
that
the
father
of
the
gods
had
paid
for
his
wisdom
illustration
odin
faces
an
evil
man
once
when
his
wisdom
was
less
great
odin
had
lived
in
the
world
of
men
frigga
his
queen
was
with
him
then
they
had
lived
on
a
bleak
island
and
they
were
known
as
grimner
the
fisherman
and
his
wife
always
odin
and
frigga
were
watching
over
the
sons
of
men
watching
to
know
which
ones
they
would
foster
and
train
so
that
they
might
have
the
strength
and
spirit
to
save
the
world
from
the
power
of
the
giants
and
while
they
were
staying
on
the
bleak
island
odin
and
frigga
saw
the
sons
of
king
hrauding
and
both
thought
that
in
them
the
spirit
of
heroes
could
be
fostered
odin
and
frigga
made
plans
to
bring
the
children
to
them
so
that
they
might
be
under
their
care
and
training
one
day
the
boys
went
fishing
a
storm
came
and
drove
their
boat
on
the
rocks
of
the
island
where
odin
and
frigga
lived
they
brought
them
to
their
hut
odin
and
frigga
and
they
told
them
they
would
care
for
them
and
train
them
through
the
winter
and
that
in
the
spring
they
would
build
a
boat
that
would
carry
them
back
to
their
father
country
we
shall
see
said
odin
to
frigga
that
night
we
shall
see
which
of
the
two
can
be
formed
into
the
noblest
hero
he
said
that
because
frigga
favored
one
of
the
boys
and
he
favored
the
other
frigga
thought
well
of
the
elder
boy
agnar
who
had
a
gentle
voice
and
quiet
and
kindly
ways
but
odin
thought
more
of
the
younger
boy
geirrod
his
name
was
and
he
was
strong
and
passionate
with
a
high
and
a
loud
voice
odin
took
geirrod
into
his
charge
and
he
showed
him
how
to
fish
and
hunt
he
made
the
boy
even
bolder
than
he
was
by
making
him
leap
from
rock
to
rock
and
by
letting
him
climb
the
highest
cliffs
and
jump
across
the
widest
chasms
he
would
bring
him
to
the
den
of
the
bear
and
make
him
fight
for
his
life
with
the
spear
he
had
made
for
him
agnar
went
to
the
chase
too
and
showed
his
skill
and
boldness
but
geirrod
overcame
him
in
nearly
every
trial
what
a
hero
geirrod
will
be
odin
would
often
say
agnar
stayed
often
with
frigga
he
would
stay
beside
her
while
she
spun
listening
to
the
tales
she
told
and
asking
such
questions
as
brought
him
more
and
more
wisdom
and
agnar
heard
of
asgard
and
of
the
dwellers
in
asgard
and
of
how
they
protected
midgard
the
world
of
men
from
the
giants
of
jötunheim
agnar
though
he
did
not
speak
out
said
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
give
all
his
life
and
all
his
strength
and
all
his
thought
to
helping
the
work
of
the
gods
spring
came
and
odin
built
a
boat
for
geirrod
and
agnar
they
could
go
back
now
to
their
own
country
and
before
they
set
out
odin
told
geirrod
that
one
day
he
would
come
to
visit
him
and
do
not
be
too
proud
to
receive
a
fisherman
in
your
hall
geirrod
said
odin
a
king
should
give
welcome
to
the
poorest
who
comes
to
his
hall
i
will
be
a
hero
no
doubt
of
that
geirrod
answered
and
i
would
be
a
king
too
only
agnar
was
born
before
me
agnar
bade
goodby
to
frigga
and
to
odin
thanking
them
for
the
care
they
had
taken
of
geirrod
and
himself
he
looked
into
frigga
eyes
and
he
told
her
that
he
would
strive
to
learn
how
he
might
fight
the
battle
for
the
gods
the
two
went
into
the
boat
and
they
rowed
away
they
came
near
to
king
hrauding
realm
they
saw
the
castle
overlooking
the
sea
then
geirrod
did
a
terrible
thing
he
turned
the
boat
back
toward
the
sea
and
he
cast
the
oars
away
then
for
he
was
well
fit
to
swim
the
roughest
sea
and
climb
the
highest
cliffs
he
plunged
into
the
water
and
struck
out
toward
the
shore
and
agnar
left
without
oars
went
drifting
out
to
sea
geirrod
climbed
the
high
cliffs
and
came
to
his
father
castle
king
hrauding
who
had
given
up
both
of
his
sons
for
lost
was
rejoiced
to
see
him
geirrod
told
of
agnar
that
he
had
fallen
out
of
the
boat
on
their
way
back
and
that
he
had
been
drowned
king
hrauding
who
had
thought
both
of
his
sons
were
gone
from
him
was
glad
enough
that
one
had
come
safe
he
put
geirrod
beside
him
on
the
throne
and
when
he
died
geirrod
was
made
king
over
the
people
and
now
odin
having
drunk
from
mimir
well
went
through
the
kingdoms
of
men
judging
kings
and
simple
people
according
to
the
wisdom
he
had
gained
he
came
at
last
to
the
kingdom
that
geirrod
ruled
over
odin
thought
that
of
all
the
kings
he
had
judged
to
be
noble
geirrod
would
assuredly
be
the
noblest
he
went
to
the
king
house
as
a
wanderer
blind
of
one
eye
wearing
a
cloak
of
dark
blue
and
with
a
wanderer
staff
in
his
hands
as
he
drew
near
the
king
house
men
on
dark
horses
came
riding
behind
him
the
first
of
the
men
did
not
turn
his
horse
as
he
came
near
the
wanderer
but
rode
on
nearly
trampling
him
to
the
ground
as
they
came
before
the
king
house
the
men
on
the
dark
horses
shouted
for
servants
only
one
servant
was
in
the
stable
he
came
out
and
took
the
horse
of
the
first
man
then
the
others
called
upon
the
wanderer
to
tend
their
horses
he
had
to
hold
the
stirrups
for
some
of
them
to
dismount
odin
knew
who
the
first
man
was
he
was
geirrod
the
king
and
he
knew
who
the
man
who
served
in
the
stable
was
he
was
agnar
brother
by
the
wisdom
he
had
gained
he
knew
that
agnar
had
come
back
to
his
father
kingdom
in
the
guise
of
a
servant
and
he
knew
that
geirrod
did
not
know
who
this
servant
was
they
went
into
the
stable
together
agnar
took
bread
and
broke
it
and
gave
some
to
the
wanderer
he
gave
him
too
straw
to
seat
himself
on
but
in
a
while
odin
said
i
would
seat
myself
at
the
fire
in
the
hall
and
eat
my
supper
of
meat
nay
stay
here
agnar
said
i
will
give
you
more
bread
and
a
wrap
to
cover
yourself
with
do
not
go
to
the
door
of
the
king
house
for
the
king
is
angry
today
and
he
might
repulse
you
how
said
odin
a
king
turn
away
a
wanderer
who
comes
to
his
door
it
can
not
be
that
he
would
do
it
today
he
is
angry
agnar
said
again
he
begged
him
not
to
go
to
the
door
of
the
king
house
but
odin
rose
up
from
the
straw
on
which
he
was
seated
and
went
to
the
door
a
porter
hunchbacked
and
with
long
arms
stood
at
the
door
i
am
a
wanderer
and
i
would
have
rest
and
food
in
the
king
hall
odin
said
not
in
this
king
hall
said
the
hunchbacked
porter
he
would
have
barred
the
door
to
odin
but
the
voice
of
the
king
called
him
away
odin
then
strode
into
the
hall
and
saw
the
king
at
table
with
his
friends
all
and
men
and
when
odin
looked
on
them
he
knew
that
the
boy
whom
he
had
trained
in
nobility
had
become
a
king
over
robbers
since
you
have
come
into
the
hall
where
we
eat
sing
to
us
wanderer
shouted
one
of
the
dark
men
aye
i
will
sing
to
you
said
odin
then
he
stood
between
two
of
the
stone
pillars
in
the
hall
and
he
sang
a
song
reproaching
the
king
for
having
fallen
into
an
evil
way
of
life
and
denouncing
all
for
following
the
cruel
ways
of
robbers
seize
him
said
the
king
when
odin
song
was
finished
the
dark
men
threw
themselves
upon
odin
and
put
chains
around
him
and
bound
him
between
the
stone
pillars
of
the
hall
he
came
into
this
hall
for
warmth
and
warmth
he
shall
have
said
geirrod
he
called
upon
his
servants
to
heap
up
wood
around
him
they
did
this
then
the
king
with
his
own
hand
put
a
blazing
torch
to
the
wood
and
the
fagots
blazed
up
around
the
wanderer
the
fagots
burned
round
and
round
him
but
the
fire
did
not
burn
the
flesh
of
odin
the
king
and
the
king
friends
stood
round
watching
with
delight
the
fires
blaze
round
a
living
man
the
fagots
all
burned
away
and
odin
was
left
standing
there
with
his
terrible
gaze
fixed
upon
the
men
who
were
so
hard
and
cruel
they
went
to
sleep
leaving
him
chained
to
the
pillars
of
the
hall
odin
could
have
broken
the
chains
and
pulled
down
the
pillars
but
he
wanted
to
see
what
else
would
happen
in
this
king
house
the
servants
were
ordered
not
to
bring
food
or
drink
to
him
but
at
dawn
when
there
was
no
one
near
agnar
came
to
him
with
a
horn
of
ale
and
gave
it
to
him
to
drink
the
next
evening
when
the
king
came
back
from
his
robberies
and
when
he
and
his
friends
sitting
down
at
the
tables
had
eaten
like
wolves
he
ordered
the
fagots
to
be
placed
around
odin
and
again
they
stood
around
watching
in
delight
the
fire
playing
around
a
living
man
and
as
before
odin
stood
there
unhurt
by
the
fire
and
his
steady
and
terrible
gaze
made
the
king
hate
him
more
and
more
and
all
day
he
was
kept
in
chains
and
the
servants
were
forbidden
to
bring
him
food
or
drink
none
knew
that
a
horn
of
ale
was
brought
to
him
at
dawn
and
night
after
night
for
eight
nights
this
went
on
then
on
the
ninth
night
when
the
fires
around
him
had
been
lighted
odin
lifted
up
his
voice
and
began
to
sing
a
song
his
song
became
louder
and
louder
and
the
king
and
the
king
friends
and
the
servants
of
the
thing
house
had
to
stand
still
and
harken
to
it
odin
sang
about
geirrod
the
king
how
the
gods
had
protected
him
giving
him
strength
and
skill
and
how
instead
of
making
a
noble
use
of
that
strength
and
skill
he
had
made
himself
like
one
of
the
wild
beasts
then
he
sang
of
how
the
vengeance
of
the
gods
was
about
to
fall
on
this
ignoble
king
the
flames
died
down
and
geirrod
and
his
friends
saw
before
them
not
a
friendless
wanderer
but
one
who
looked
more
kingly
than
any
king
of
the
earth
the
chains
fell
down
from
his
body
and
he
advanced
toward
the
evil
company
then
geirrod
rushed
upon
him
with
his
sword
in
hand
to
kill
him
the
sword
struck
him
but
odin
remained
unhurt
thy
life
runs
out
the
gods
they
are
wroth
with
thee
draw
near
if
thou
canst
odin
thou
shalt
see
so
odin
sang
and
in
fear
of
his
terrible
gaze
geirrod
and
his
company
shrank
away
and
as
they
shrank
away
they
were
changed
into
beasts
into
the
wolves
that
range
the
forests
and
agnar
came
forward
and
him
odin
declared
to
be
king
all
the
folk
were
glad
when
agnar
came
to
rule
over
them
for
they
had
been
oppressed
by
geirrod
in
his
cruel
reign
and
agnar
was
not
only
kind
but
he
was
strong
and
victorious
in
his
rule

odin
wins
for
men
the
magic
mead
it
was
the
dwarfs
who
brewed
the
magic
mead
and
it
was
the
giants
who
hid
it
away
but
it
was
odin
who
brought
it
from
the
place
where
it
was
hidden
and
gave
it
to
the
sons
of
men
those
who
drank
of
the
magic
mead
became
very
wise
and
not
only
that
but
they
could
put
their
wisdom
into
such
beautiful
words
that
every
one
who
heard
would
love
and
remember
it
the
dwarfs
brewed
the
magic
mead
through
cruelty
and
villainy
they
made
it
out
of
the
blood
of
a
man
the
man
was
kvasir
the
poet
he
had
wisdom
and
he
had
such
beautiful
words
with
it
that
what
he
said
was
loved
and
remembered
by
all
the
dwarfs
brought
kvasir
down
into
their
caverns
and
they
killed
him
there
now
they
said
we
have
blood
and
kvasir
wisdom
no
one
else
will
have
his
wisdom
but
us
they
poured
the
blood
into
three
jars
and
they
mixed
it
with
honey
and
from
it
they
brewed
the
magic
mead
having
killed
a
man
the
dwarfs
became
more
and
more
bold
they
came
out
of
their
caverns
and
went
up
and
down
through
midgard
the
world
of
men
they
went
into
jötunheim
and
began
to
play
their
evil
tricks
on
the
most
harmless
of
the
giants
they
came
upon
one
giant
who
was
very
simple
gilling
was
his
name
they
persuaded
gilling
to
row
them
out
to
sea
in
a
boat
then
the
two
most
cunning
of
the
dwarfs
galar
and
fialar
steered
the
boat
on
to
a
rock
the
boat
split
gilling
who
could
not
swim
was
drowned
the
dwarfs
clambered
up
on
pieces
of
the
boat
and
came
safely
ashore
they
were
so
delighted
with
their
evil
tricks
that
they
wanted
to
play
some
more
of
them
galar
and
fialar
then
thought
of
a
new
piece
of
mischief
they
might
do
they
led
their
band
of
dwarfs
to
gilling
house
and
screamed
out
to
his
wife
that
gilling
was
dead
the
giant
wife
began
to
weep
and
lament
at
last
she
rushed
out
of
the
house
weeping
and
clapping
her
hands
now
galar
and
fialar
had
clambered
up
on
the
lintel
of
the
house
and
as
she
came
running
out
they
cast
a
millstone
on
her
head
it
struck
her
and
gilling
wife
fell
down
dead
more
and
more
the
dwarfs
were
delighted
at
the
destruction
they
were
making
they
were
so
insolent
now
that
they
made
up
songs
and
sang
them
songs
that
were
all
a
boast
of
how
they
had
killed
kvasir
the
poet
and
gilling
the
giant
and
gilling
wife
they
stayed
around
jötunheim
tormenting
all
whom
they
were
able
to
torment
and
flattering
themselves
that
they
were
great
and
strong
they
stayed
too
long
however
suttung
gilling
brother
tracked
them
down
and
captured
them
suttung
was
not
harmless
and
simple
like
gilling
his
brother
he
was
cunning
and
he
was
covetous
once
they
were
in
his
hands
the
dwarfs
had
no
chance
of
making
an
escape
he
took
them
and
left
them
on
a
rock
in
the
sea
a
rock
that
the
tide
would
cover
the
giant
stood
up
in
the
water
taller
than
the
rock
and
the
tide
as
it
came
in
did
not
rise
above
his
knees
he
stood
there
watching
the
dwarfs
as
the
water
rose
up
round
them
and
they
became
more
and
more
terrified
oh
take
us
off
the
rock
good
suttung
they
cried
out
to
him
take
us
off
the
rock
and
we
will
give
you
gold
and
jewels
take
us
off
the
rock
and
we
will
give
you
a
necklace
as
beautiful
as
brisingamen
so
they
cried
out
to
him
but
the
giant
suttung
only
laughed
at
them
he
had
no
need
of
gold
or
jewels
then
fialar
and
galar
cried
out
take
us
off
the
rock
and
we
will
give
you
the
jars
of
the
magic
mead
we
have
brewed
the
magic
mead
said
suttung
this
is
something
that
no
one
else
has
it
would
be
well
to
get
it
for
it
might
help
us
in
the
battle
against
the
gods
yes
i
will
get
the
magic
mead
from
them
he
took
the
band
of
dwarfs
off
the
rock
but
he
held
galar
and
fialar
their
chiefs
while
the
others
went
into
their
caverns
and
brought
up
the
jars
of
the
magic
mead
suttung
took
the
mead
and
brought
it
to
a
cavern
in
a
mountain
near
his
dwelling
and
thus
it
happened
that
the
magic
mead
brewed
by
the
dwarfs
through
cruelty
and
villainy
came
into
the
hands
of
the
giants
and
the
story
now
tells
how
odin
the
eldest
of
the
gods
at
that
time
in
the
world
as
vegtam
the
wanderer
took
the
magic
mead
out
of
suttung
possession
and
brought
it
into
the
world
of
men
now
suttung
had
a
daughter
named
gunnlöd
and
she
by
her
goodness
and
her
beauty
was
like
gerda
and
skadi
the
giant
maids
whom
the
dwellers
in
asgard
favored
suttung
that
he
might
have
a
guardian
for
the
magic
mead
enchanted
gunnlöd
turning
her
from
a
beautiful
giant
maiden
into
a
witch
with
long
teeth
and
sharp
nails
he
shut
her
into
the
cavern
where
the
jars
of
the
magic
mead
were
hidden
odin
heard
of
the
death
of
kvasir
whom
he
honored
above
all
men
the
dwarfs
who
slew
him
he
had
closed
up
in
their
caverns
so
that
they
were
never
again
able
to
come
out
into
the
world
of
men
and
then
he
set
out
to
get
the
magic
mead
that
he
might
give
it
to
men
so
that
tasting
it
they
would
have
wisdom
and
words
would
be
at
their
command
that
would
make
wisdom
loved
and
remembered
how
odin
won
the
magic
mead
out
of
the
cavern
where
suttung
had
hidden
it
and
how
he
broke
the
enchantment
that
lay
upon
gunnlöd
suttung
daughter
is
a
story
often
told
around
the
hearths
of
men
nine
strong
thralls
were
mowing
in
a
field
as
a
wanderer
went
by
clad
in
a
dark
blue
cloak
and
carrying
a
wanderer
staff
in
his
hand
one
of
the
thralls
spoke
to
the
wanderer
tell
them
in
the
house
of
baugi
up
yonder
that
i
can
mow
no
more
until
a
whetstone
to
sharpen
my
scythe
is
sent
to
me
here
is
a
whetstone
said
the
wanderer
and
he
took
one
from
his
belt
the
thrall
who
had
spoken
whetted
his
scythe
with
it
and
began
to
mow
the
grass
went
down
before
his
scythe
as
if
the
wind
had
cut
it
give
us
the
whetstone
give
us
the
whetstone
cried
the
other
thralls
the
wanderer
threw
the
whetstone
amongst
them
leaving
them
quarreling
over
it
and
went
on
his
way
the
wanderer
came
to
the
house
of
baugi
the
brother
of
suttung
he
rested
in
baugi
house
and
at
supper
time
he
was
given
food
at
the
great
table
and
while
he
was
eating
with
the
giant
a
messenger
from
the
field
came
in
baugi
said
the
messenger
your
nine
thralls
are
all
dead
they
killed
each
other
with
their
scythes
fighting
in
the
field
about
a
whetstone
there
are
no
thralls
now
to
do
your
work
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
said
baugi
the
giant
my
fields
will
not
be
mown
now
and
i
shall
have
no
hay
to
feed
my
cattle
and
my
horses
in
the
winter
i
might
work
for
you
said
the
wanderer
one
man
work
is
no
use
to
me
said
the
giant
i
must
have
the
work
of
nine
men
i
shall
do
the
work
of
nine
men
said
the
wanderer
give
me
a
trial
and
see
the
next
day
vegtam
the
wanderer
went
into
baugi
field
he
did
as
much
work
as
the
nine
thralls
had
done
in
a
day
stay
with
me
for
the
season
said
baugi
and
i
shall
give
you
a
full
reward
so
vegtam
stayed
at
the
giant
house
and
worked
in
the
giant
fields
and
when
all
the
work
of
the
season
was
done
baugi
said
to
him
speak
now
and
tell
me
what
reward
i
am
to
give
you
the
only
reward
i
shall
ask
of
you
said
vegtam
is
a
draught
of
the
magic
mead
the
magic
mead
said
baugi
i
do
not
know
where
it
is
nor
how
to
get
it
your
brother
suttung
has
it
go
to
him
and
claim
a
draught
of
the
magic
mead
for
me
baugi
went
to
suttung
but
when
he
heard
what
he
had
come
for
the
giant
suttung
turned
on
his
brother
in
a
rage
a
draught
of
the
magic
mead
he
said
to
no
one
will
i
give
a
draught
of
the
magic
mead
have
i
not
enchanted
my
daughter
gunnlöd
so
that
she
may
watch
over
it
and
you
tell
me
that
a
wanderer
who
has
done
the
work
of
nine
men
for
you
asks
a
draught
of
the
magic
mead
for
his
fee
o
giant
as
foolish
as
gilling
o
oaf
of
a
giant
who
could
have
done
such
work
for
you
and
who
would
demand
such
a
fee
from
you
but
one
of
our
enemies
the
æsir
go
from
me
now
and
never
come
to
me
again
with
talk
of
the
magic
mead
baugi
went
back
to
his
house
and
told
the
wanderer
that
suttung
would
yield
none
of
the
magic
mead
i
hold
you
to
your
bargain
said
vegtam
the
wanderer
and
you
will
have
to
get
me
the
fee
i
asked
come
with
me
now
and
help
me
to
get
it
he
made
baugi
bring
him
to
the
place
where
the
magic
mead
was
hidden
the
place
was
a
cavern
in
the
mountain
in
front
of
that
cavern
was
a
great
mass
of
stone
we
can
not
move
that
stone
nor
get
through
it
said
baugi
i
can
not
help
you
to
your
fee
the
wanderer
drew
an
auger
from
his
belt
this
will
bore
through
the
rock
if
there
is
strength
behind
it
you
have
the
strength
giant
begin
now
and
bore
baugi
took
the
auger
in
his
hands
and
bored
with
all
his
strength
and
the
wanderer
stood
by
leaning
on
his
staff
calm
and
majestic
in
his
cloak
of
blue
i
have
made
a
deep
deep
hole
it
goes
through
the
rock
baugi
said
at
last
the
wanderer
went
to
the
hole
and
blew
into
it
the
dust
of
the
rock
flew
back
into
their
faces
so
that
is
your
boasted
strength
giant
he
said
you
have
not
bored
through
the
rock
work
again
then
baugi
took
the
auger
again
and
he
bored
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
rock
and
he
blew
into
it
and
lo
his
breath
went
through
then
he
looked
at
the
wanderer
to
see
what
he
would
do
his
eyes
had
become
fierce
and
he
held
the
auger
in
his
hand
as
if
it
were
a
stabbing
knife
look
up
to
the
head
of
the
rock
said
the
wanderer
as
baugi
looked
up
the
wanderer
changed
himself
into
a
snake
and
glided
into
the
hole
in
the
rock
and
baugi
struck
at
him
with
the
auger
hoping
to
kill
him
but
the
snake
slipped
through
behind
the
mighty
rock
there
was
a
hollow
place
all
lighted
up
by
the
shining
crystals
in
the
rock
and
within
the
hollow
place
there
was
an
witch
with
long
teeth
and
sharp
nails
but
she
sat
there
rocking
herself
and
letting
tears
fall
from
her
eyes
o
youth
and
beauty
she
sang
o
sight
of
men
and
women
sad
sad
for
me
it
is
that
you
are
shut
away
and
that
i
have
only
this
cavern
and
this
horrible
form
a
snake
glided
across
the
floor
oh
that
you
were
deadly
and
that
you
might
slay
me
cried
the
witch
the
snake
glided
past
her
then
she
heard
a
voice
speak
softly
gunnlöd
gunnlöd
she
looked
round
and
there
standing
behind
her
was
a
majestic
man
clad
in
a
cloak
of
dark
blue
odin
the
eldest
of
the
gods
you
have
come
to
take
the
magic
mead
that
my
father
has
set
me
here
to
guard
she
cried
you
shall
not
have
it
rather
shall
i
spill
it
out
on
the
thirsty
earth
of
the
cavern
gunnlöd
he
said
and
he
came
to
her
she
looked
at
him
and
she
felt
the
red
blood
of
youth
come
back
into
her
cheeks
she
put
her
hands
with
their
sharp
nails
over
her
breast
and
she
felt
the
nails
drive
into
her
flesh
save
me
from
all
this
ugliness
she
cried
i
will
save
you
odin
said
he
went
to
her
he
took
her
hands
and
held
them
he
kissed
her
on
the
mouth
all
the
marks
of
ill
favor
went
from
her
she
was
no
longer
bent
but
tall
and
shapely
her
eyes
became
wide
and
deep
blue
her
mouth
became
red
and
her
hands
soft
and
beautiful
she
became
as
fair
as
gerda
the
giant
maid
whom
frey
had
wed
they
stayed
looking
at
each
other
then
they
sat
down
side
by
side
and
talked
softly
to
each
other
odin
the
eldest
of
the
gods
and
gunnlöd
the
beautiful
giant
maiden
she
gave
him
the
three
jars
of
the
magic
mead
and
she
told
him
she
would
go
out
of
the
cavern
with
him
three
days
passed
and
still
they
were
together
then
odin
by
his
wisdom
found
hidden
paths
and
passages
that
led
out
of
the
cavern
and
he
brought
gunnlöd
out
into
the
light
of
the
day
and
he
brought
with
him
the
jars
of
the
magic
mead
the
mead
whose
taste
gives
wisdom
and
wisdom
in
such
beautiful
words
that
all
love
and
remember
it
and
gunnlöd
who
had
tasted
a
little
of
the
magic
mead
wandered
through
the
world
singing
of
the
beauty
and
the
might
of
odin
and
of
her
love
for
him
illustration
odin
tells
to
vidar
his
silent
son
the
secret
of
his
doings
it
was
not
only
to
giants
and
men
that
odin
showed
himself
in
the
days
when
he
went
through
jötunheim
and
midgard
as
vegtam
the
wanderer
he
met
and
he
spoke
with
the
gods
also
with
one
who
lived
far
away
from
asgard
and
with
others
who
came
to
midgard
and
to
jötunheim
the
one
who
lived
far
away
from
asgard
was
vidar
odin
silent
son
far
within
a
wilderness
with
branches
and
tall
grass
growing
around
him
vidar
sat
and
near
by
him
a
horse
grazed
with
a
saddle
upon
it
a
horse
that
was
ever
ready
for
the
speedy
journey
and
odin
now
vegtam
the
wanderer
came
into
that
silent
place
and
spoke
to
vidar
the
silent
god
o
vidar
he
said
strangest
of
all
my
sons
god
who
will
live
when
all
of
us
have
passed
away
god
who
will
bring
the
memory
of
the
dwellers
of
asgard
into
a
world
that
will
know
not
their
power
o
vidar
well
do
i
know
why
there
grazes
near
by
thee
the
horse
ever
ready
for
the
speedy
journey
it
is
that
thou
mayst
spring
upon
it
and
ride
unchecked
a
son
speeding
to
avenge
his
father
to
you
only
o
vidar
the
silent
one
will
i
speak
of
the
secrets
of
my
doings
who
but
you
can
know
why
i
odin
the
eldest
of
the
gods
hung
on
the
tree
ygdrassil
nine
days
and
nine
nights
mine
own
spear
transfixing
me
i
hung
upon
that
windy
tree
that
i
might
learn
the
wisdom
that
would
give
me
power
in
the
nine
worlds
on
the
ninth
night
the
runes
of
wisdom
appeared
before
mine
eyes
and
slipping
down
from
the
tree
i
took
them
to
myself
and
i
shall
tell
why
my
ravens
fly
to
thee
carrying
in
their
beaks
scraps
of
leather
it
is
that
thou
mayst
make
for
thyself
a
sandal
with
that
sandal
on
thou
mayst
put
thy
foot
on
the
lower
jaw
of
a
mighty
wolf
and
rend
him
all
the
shoemakers
of
the
earth
throw
on
the
ground
scraps
of
the
leather
they
use
so
that
thou
mayst
be
able
to
make
the
sandal
for
thy
foot
and
i
have
counseled
the
dwellers
on
earth
to
cut
off
the
fingernails
and
the
toenails
of
their
dead
lest
from
those
fingernails
and
toenails
the
giants
make
for
themselves
the
ship
naglfar
in
which
they
will
sail
from
the
north
on
the
day
of
ragnarök
the
twilight
of
the
gods
more
vidar
i
will
tell
to
thee
i
living
amongst
men
have
wed
the
daughter
of
a
hero
my
son
shall
live
as
a
mortal
amongst
mortals
sigi
his
name
shall
be
from
him
shall
spring
heroes
who
will
fill
valhalla
my
own
hall
in
asgard
with
heroes
against
the
day
of
our
strife
with
the
giants
and
with
surtur
of
the
flaming
sword
for
long
odin
stayed
in
that
silent
place
communing
with
his
silent
son
with
vidar
who
with
his
brother
would
live
beyond
the
lives
of
the
dwellers
of
asgard
and
who
would
bring
into
another
day
and
another
world
the
memory
of
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
for
long
odin
spoke
with
him
and
then
he
went
across
the
wilderness
where
the
grass
and
the
bushes
grew
and
where
that
horse
grazed
in
readiness
for
the
sudden
journey
he
went
toward
the
seashore
where
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
were
now
gathered
for
the
feast
that
old
ægir
the
giant
king
of
the
sea

before

came
loki
made
the
company
merry
by
the
tales
that
he
told
in
mockery
of
thor
loki
long
since
had
his
lips
unloosed
from
the
thong
that
the
dwarf
brock
had
sewn
them
with
and
thor
had
forgotten
the
wrong
that
he
had
done
to
sif
loki
had
been
with
thor
in
his
wanderings
through
jötunheim
and
about
these
wanderings
he
now
told
mocking
tales
he
told
how
he
had
seen
thor
in
his
chariot
of
brass
drawn
by
two
goats
go
across
bifröst
the
rainbow
bridge
none
of
the
æsir
or
the
vanir
knew
on
what
adventure
thor
was
bent
but
loki
followed
him
and
thor
kept
him
in
his
company
as
they
traveled
on
in
the
brass
chariot
drawn
by
the
two
goats
thor
told
loki
of
the
adventure
on
which
he
was
bent
he
would
go
into
jötunheim
even
into
utgard
the
giants
city
and
he
would
try
his
strength
against
the
giants
he
was
not
afraid
of
aught
that
might
happen
for
he
carried
miölnir
his
hammer
with
him
their
way
was
through
midgard
the
world
of
men
once
as
they
were
traveling
on
night
came
upon
them
as
they
were
hungry
and
in
need
of
shelter
they
saw
a
peasant
hut
and
they
drove
the
chariot
toward
it
unyoking
the
goats
and
leaving
them
standing
in
a
hollow
beside
the
chariot
the
two
looking
not
like
dwellers
in
asgard
but
like
men
traveling
through
the
country
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
hut
and
asked
for
food
and
shelter
they
could
have
shelter
the
peasant
and
his
wife
told
them
but
they
could
not
have
food
there
was
little
in
that
place
and
what
little
there
had
been
they
had
eaten
for
supper
the
peasant
showed
them
the
inside
of
the
hut
it
was
poor
and
bare
and
there
was
nothing
there
to
give
anyone
in
the
morning
the
peasant
said
he
would
go
down
to
the
river
and
catch
some
fish
for
a
meal
we
ca
wait
until
morning
we
must
eat
now
said
thor
and
i
think
i
can
provide
a
good
meal
for
us
all
he
went
over
to
where
his
goats
stood
in
the
hollow
beside
the
chariot
of
brass
and
striking
them
with
his
hammer
he
left
them
lifeless
on
the
ground
he
skinned
the
goats
then
and
taking
up
the
bones
very
carefully
he
left
them
down
on
the
skins
skins
and
bones
he
lifted
up
and
bringing
them
into
the
house
he
left
them
in
a
hole
above
the
peasant
fireplace
no
one
said
he
in
a
commanding
voice
must
touch
the
bones
that
i
leave
here
then
he
brought
the
meat
into
the
house
soon
it
was
cooked
and
laid
smoking
on
the
table
the
peasant
and
his
wife
and
his
son
sat
round
the
board
with
thor
and
loki
they
had
not
eaten
plentifully
for
many
days
and
now
the
man
and
the
woman
fed
themselves
well
thialfi
was
the
name
of
the
peasant
son
he
was
a
growing
lad
and
had
an
appetite
that
had
not
been
satisfied
for
long
while
the
meat
was
on
the
table
his
father
and
mother
had
kept
him
going
here
and
there
carrying
water
putting
fagots
on
the
fire
and
holding
a
blazing
stick
so
that
those
at
the
table
might
see
to
eat
there
was
not
much
left
for
him
when
he
was
able
to
sit
down
for
thor
and
loki
had
great
appetites
and
the
lad
father
and
mother
had
eaten
to
make
up
for
days
of
want
so
thialfi
got
little
out
of
that
plentiful
feast
when
the
meal
was
finished
they
lay
down
on
the
benches
thor
because
he
had
made
a
long
journey
that
day
slept
very
soundly
thialfi
lay
down
on
a
bench
too
but
his
thoughts
were
still
upon
the
food
when
all
were
asleep
he
thought
he
would
take
one
of
the
bones
that
were
in
the
skins
above
him
and
break
and
gnaw
it
so
in
the
dead
of
the
night
the
lad
stood
up
on
the
bench
and
took
down
the
goatskins
that
thor
had
left
so
carefully
there
he
took
out
a
bone
broke
it
and
gnawed
it
for
the
marrow
loki
was
awake
and
saw
him
do
this
but
he
relishing
mischief
as
much
as
ever
did
nothing
to
stay
the
lad
he
put
the
bone
he
had
broken
back
in
the
skins
and
he
left
the
skins
back
in
the
hole
above
the
fireplace
then
he
went
to
sleep
on
the
bench
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
they
were
up
the
first
thing
thor
did
was
to
take
the
skins
out
of
the
hole
he
carried
them
carefully
out
to
the
hollow
where
he
had
left
the
goats
standing
he
put
each
goatskin
down
with
the
bones
in
it
he
struck
each
with
his
hammer
and
the
goats
sprang
up
alive
horns
and
hoofs
and
all
but
one
was
not
as
he
had
been
before
he
limped
badly
thor
examined
the
leg
and
found
out
that
one
bone
was
broken
in
terrible
anger
he
turned
on
the
peasant
his
wife
and
his
son
a
bone
of
this
goat
has
been
broken
under
your
roof
he
shouted
for
that
i
shall
destroy
your
house
and
leave
you
all
dead
under
it
thialfi
wept
then
he
came
forward
and
touched
the
knees
of
thor
i
did
not
know
what
harm
i
did
he
said
i
broke
the
bone
thor
had
his
hammer
lifted
up
to
crush
him
into
the
earth
but
he
could
not
bring
it
down
on
the
weeping
boy
he
let
his
hammer
rest
on
the
ground
again
you
will
have
to
do
much
service
for
me
for
having
lamed
my
goat
he
said
come
with
me
and
so
the
lad
thialfi
went
off
with
thor
and
loki
thor
took
in
his
powerful
hands
the
shafts
of
the
chariot
of
brass
and
he
dragged
it
into
a
lonely
mountain
hollow
where
neither
men
nor
giants
came
and
they
left
the
goats
in
a
great
empty
forest
to
stay
resting
there
until
thor
called
to
them
again
thor
and
loki
and
the
lad
thialfi
went
across
from
midgard
into
jötunheim
because
of
miölnir
the
great
hammer
that
he
carried
thor
felt
safe
in
the
realm
of
the
giants
and
loki
who
trusted
in
his
own
cunning
felt
safe
too
the
lad
thialfi
trusted
in
thor
so
much
that
he
had
no
fear
they
were
long
in
making
the
journey
and
while
they
were
traveling
thor
and
loki
trained
thialfi
to
be
a
quick
and
a
strong
lad
one
day
they
came
out
on
a
moor
all
day
they
crossed
it
and
at
night
it
still
stretched
far
before
them
a
great
wind
was
blowing
night
was
falling
and
they
saw
no
shelter
near
in
the
dusk
they
saw
a
shape
that
looked
to
be
a
mountain
and
they
went
toward
it
hoping
to
find
some
shelter
in
a
cave
then
loki
saw
a
lower
shape
that
looked
as
if
it
might
be
a
shelter
they
walked
around
it
loki
and
thor
and
the
lad
thialfi
it
was
a
house
but
a
house
most
oddly
shaped
the
entrance
was
a
long
wide
hall
that
had
no
doorway
when
they
entered
this
hall
they
found
five
long
and
narrow
chambers
running
off
it
it
is
an
odd
place
but
it
is
the
best
shelter
we
can
get
loki
said
you
and
i
thor
will
take
the
two
longest
rooms
and
the
lad
thialfi
can
take
one
of
the
little
rooms
they
entered
their
chambers
and
they
lay
down
to
sleep
but
from
the
mountain
outside
there
came
a
noise
that
was
like
moaning
forests
and
falling
cataracts
the
chamber
where
each
one
slept
was
shaken
by
the
noise
neither
thor
nor
loki
nor
the
lad
thialfi
slept
that
night
in
the
morning
they
left
the
house
and
turned
their
faces
toward
the
mountain
it
was
not
a
mountain
at
all
but
a
giant
he
was
lying
on
the
ground
when
they
saw
him
but
just
then
he
rolled
over
and
sat
up
little
men
little
men
he
shouted
to
them
have
you
passed
by
a
glove
of
mine
on
your
way
he
stood
up
and
looked
all
around
him
ho
i
see
my
glove
now
he
said
thor
and
loki
and
the
lad
thialfi
stood
still
as
the
giant
came
toward
them
he
leaned
over
and
picked
up
the
shelter
they
had
slept
in
he
put
it
on
his
hand
it
was
really
his
glove
thor
gripped
his
hammer
and
loki
and
the
lad
thialfi
stood
behind
him
but
the
giant
seemed
enough
where
might
ye
be
bound
for
little
men
said
he
to
utgard
in
jötunheim
thor
replied
boldly
oh
to
that
place
said
the
giant
come
then
i
shall
be
with
ye
so
far
you
can
call
me
skyrmir
can
you
give
us
breakfast
said
thor
he
spoke
crossly
for
he
did
not
want
it
to
appear
that
there
was
any
reason
to
be
afraid
of
the
giant
i
can
give
you
breakfast
said
skyrmir
but
i
do
want
to
stop
to
eat
now
we
sit
down
as
soon
as
i
have
an
appetite
come
along
now
here
is
my
wallet
to
carry
it
has
my
provisions
in
it
he
gave
thor
his
wallet
thor
put
it
on
his
back
and
put
thialfi
sitting
upon
it
on
and
on
the
giant
strode
and
thor
and
loki
were
barely
able
to
keep
up
with
him
it
was
midday
before
he
showed
any
signs
of
halting
to
take
breakfast
they
came
to
an
enormous
tree
under
it
skyrmir
sat
down
i
sleep
before
i
eat
he
said
but
you
can
open
my
wallet
my
little
men
and
make
your
meal
out
of
it
saying
this
he
stretched
himself
out
and
in
a
few
minutes
thor
and
loki
and
the
lad
thialfi
heard
the
same
sounds
as
kept
them
awake
the
night
before
sounds
that
were
like
forests
moaning
and
cataracts
falling
it
was
skyrmir
snoring
thor
and
loki
and
the
lad
thialfi
were
too
hungry
now
to
be
disturbed
by
these
tremendous
noises
thor
tried
to
open
the
wallet
but
he
found
it
was
not
easy
to
undo
the
knots
then
loki
tried
to
open
it
in
spite
of
all
loki
cunning
he
could
not
undo
the
knots
then
thor
took
the
wallet
from
him
and
tried
to
break
the
knots
by
main
strength
not
even
thor
strength
could
break
them
he
threw
the
wallet
down
in
his
rage
the
snoring
of
skyrmir
became
louder
and
louder
thor
stood
up
in
his
rage
he
grasped
miölnir
and
flung
it
at
the
head
of
the
sleeping
giant
the
hammer
struck
him
on
the
head
but
skyrmir
only
stirred
in
his
sleep
did
a
leaf
fall
on
my
head
he
said
he
turned
round
on
the
other
side
and
went
to
sleep
again
the
hammer
came
back
to
thor
hand
as
soon
as
skyrmir
snored
he
flung
it
again
aiming
at
the
giant
forehead
it
struck
there
the
giant
opened
his
eyes
has
an
acorn
fallen
on
my
forehead
he
said
again
he
went
to
sleep
but
now
thor
terribly
roused
stood
over
his
head
with
the
hammer
held
in
his
hands
he
struck
him
on
the
forehead
it
was
the
greatest
blow
that
thor
had
ever
dealt
a
bird
is
pecking
at
my
forehead
there
is
no
chance
to
sleep
here
said
skyrmir
sitting
up
and

men

you
have
breakfast

over
my
wallet
to
me

lad

brought
him

wallet

opened
it
took
out
his
provisions
and
gave
a
share
to
thor
and
loki
and
the
lad
thialfi
thor
would
not
take
provision
from
him
but
loki
and
the
lad
thialfi
took
it
and
ate
when
the
meal
was
finished
skyrmir
rose
up
and
said
time
for
us
to
be
going
toward
utgard
as
they
went
on
their
way
skyrmir
talked
to
loki
i
always
feel
very
small
when
i
go
into
utgard
he
said
you
see
i
such
a
small
and
a
weak
fellow
and
the
folk
who
live
there
are
so
big
and
powerful
but
you
and
your
friends
will
be
welcomed
in
utgard
they
will
be
sure
to
make
little
pets
of
you
and
then
he
left
them
and
they
went
into
utgard
the
city
of
the
giants
giants
were
going
up
and
down
in
the
streets
they
were
not
so
huge
as
skyrmir
would
have
them
believe
loki
noticed
utgard
was
the
asgard
of
the
giants
but
in
its
buildings
there
was
not
a
line
of
the
beauty
that
there
was
in
the
palaces
of
the
gods
gladsheim
and
breidablik
or
fensalir
huge
but
shapeless
the
buildings
arose
like
mountains
or
icebergs
o
beautiful
asgard
with
the
dome
above
it
of
the
deepest
blue
asgard
with
the
clouds
around
it
heaped
up
like
mountains
of
diamonds
asgard
with
its
rainbow
bridge
and
its
glittering
gates
o
beautiful
asgard
could
it
be
indeed
that
these
giants
would
one
day
overthrow
you
thor
and
loki
with
the
lad
thialfi
went
to
the
palace
of
the
king
the
hammer
that
thor
gripped
would
they
knew
make
them
safe
even
there
they
passed
between
rows
of
giant
guards
and
came
to
the
king
seat
we
know
you
thor
and
loki
said
the
giant
king
and
we
know
that

to
try
his
strength
against
the
giants
we
shall
have
a
contest

should
like
to

him
enter
the
race
today
now

the

runner
in
midgard
and
all
the
time
he
had
been
with
them
loki
and
thor
had
trained
him
in
quickness
and
so
thialfi
was
not
fearful
of
racing
against
the
giants
youths
the
king
called
on
one
named
hugi
and
placed
him
against
thialfi
the
pair
started
together
thialfi
sped
off
loki
and
thor
watched
the
race
anxiously
for
they
thought
it
would
be
well
for
them
if
they
had
a
triumph
over
the
dwellers
in
utgard
in
the
first
contest
but
they
saw
hugi
leave
thialfi
behind
they
saw
the
giant
youth
reach
the
winning
post
circle
round
it
and
come
back
to
the
starting
place
before
thialfi
had
reached
the
end
of
the
course
thialfi
who
did
not

again
the

once
more
and
this
time

to
thor
and
loki
that

had
left
the
starting
place
at
all
he

the

into
the
great
hall
of

the
giant
king
was
there
with
a
throng
of
his
friends
thor
marched
into
the
hall
with
miölnir
his
great
hammer
in
his
hands
our
young
men

the
king
and
they
want
to
know
if
you
asa
thor
would
drink
out
of
it
a
morning
draught
but
i
must
tell
you
that
they
think
that
no
one
of
the
æsir
could
empty
the
horn
at
one
draught
give
it
to
me
said
thor
there
is
no
horn
you
can
hand
me
that
i
can
not
empty
at
a
draught
a
great
horn
brimmed
and
flowing
was
brought
over
to
him
handing
miölnir
to
loki
and
bidding
him
stand
so
that
he
might
keep
the
hammer
in
sight
thor
raised
the
horn
to
his
mouth
he
drank
and
drank
he
felt
sure
there
was
not
a
drop
left
in
the
horn
as
he
laid
it
on
the
ground
there
he
gasped

giant
horn

the
giants
looked
within
the
horn
and
laughed

asa
thor
said
the
giant
king
look
into
the
horn
again
you

below
the
brim
and
thor
looked
into
it
and
saw
that
the
horn
was
not
half
emptied
in
a
mighty
rage
he
lifted
it
to
his
lips
again
he
drank
and
drank
and
drank
then
satisfied
that
he
had
emptied
it
to
the
bottom
he
left
the
horn
on
the
ground
and
walked
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
hall
thor

horn
said
one
of
the
giants
lifting
it
up
but

what
remains
in
it
thor
strode
back
and
looked
again
into
the
horn

was
still
half
filled
he
turned
round
to
see
that
all
the
giants
were
laughing
at
him
asa
thor
asa
thor
said
the
giant
king
we
know
not
how
you
are
going
to
deal
with
us
in
the
next
feat
but
you
certainly
are
not
able
to
drink
against
the
giants
said
thor
i
can
lift
up
and
set
down
any
being
in
your
hall
as
he
said
this
a
great
cat
bounded
into
the
hall
and
stood
before
thor
her
back
arched
and
her
fur
bristling
then
lift
the
cat
off
the
ground
said
the
giant
king
thor
strode
to
the
cat
determined
to
lift
her
up
and
fling
her
amongst
the
mocking
giants
he
put
his
hands
to
the
cat
but
he
could
not
raise
her
up
up
went
thor
arms
up
up
as
high
as
they
could
go
the
cat
arched
back
went
up
to
the
roof
but
her
feet
were
never
taken
off
the
ground
and
as
he
heaved
and
heaved
with
all
his
might
he
heard
the
laughter
of
the
giants
all
round
him
he
turned
away
his
eyes
flaming
with
anger
i
am
not
wont
to
try
to
lift
cats
he
said
bring
me
one
to
wrestle
with
and
i
swear
you
shall
see
me
overthrow
him
here
is
one
for
you
to
wrestle
with
asa
thor
said
the
king
thor
looked
round
and
saw
an
old
woman
hobbling
toward
him
she
was
and
toothless
this
is
ellie
my
ancient
nurse
said
the
giant
king
she
is
the
one
we
would
have
you
wrestle
with
thor
does
not
wrestle
with
old
women
i
will
lay
my
hands
on
your
tallest
giants
instead
ellie
has
come
where
you
are
said
the
giant
king
now
it
is
she
who
will
lay
hands
upon
you
the
old
woman
hobbled
toward
thor
her
eyes
gleaming
under
her
falling
fringes
of
gray
hair
thor
stood
unable
to
move
as
the
hag
came
toward
him
she
laid
her
hands
upon
his
arms
her
feet
began
to
trip
at
his
he
tried
to
cast
her
from
him
then
he
found
that
her
feet
and
her
hands
were
as
strong
against
his
as
bands
and
stakes
of
iron
then
began
a
wrestling
match
in
earnest
between
thor
and
the
ancient
crone
ellie
round
and
round
the
hall
they
wrestled
and
thor
was
not
able
to
bend
the
old
woman
backward
nor
sideways
instead
he
became
less
and
less
able
under
her
terrible
grasp
she
forced
him
down
down
and
at
last
he
could
only
save
himself
from
being
left
prone
on
the
ground
by
throwing
himself
down
on
one
knee
and
holding
the
hag
by
the
shoulders
she
tried
to
force
him
down
on
the
ground
but
she
could
not
do
that
then
she
broke
from
him
hobbled
to
the
door
and
went
out
of
the
hall
thor
rose
up
and
took
the
hammer
from
loki
hands
without
a
word
he
went
out
of
the
hall
and
along
the
ways
and
toward
the
gate
of
the
giants
city
he
spoke
no
word
to
loki
nor
to
the
lad
thialfi
who
went
with
him
for
the
seven
weeks
that
they
journeyed
through
jötunheim
illustration
how
thor
and
loki
befooled
thrym
the
giant
loki
told
another
tale
about
thor
about
thor
and
thrym
a
stupid
giant
who
had
cunning
streaks
in
him
loki
and
thor
had
been
in
this
house
he
had
made
a
feast
for
them
and
thor
had
been
unwatchful
then
when
they
were
far
from
jötunheim
thor
missed
miölnir
missed
the
hammer
that
was
the
defence
of
asgard
and
the
help
of
the
gods
he
could
not
remember
how
or
where
he
had
mislaid
it
loki
thoughts
went
toward
thrym
that
stupid
giant
who
yet
had
cunning
streaks
in
him
thor
who
had
lost
the
hammer
that
he
had
sworn
never
to
let
out
of
his
sight
did
not
know
what
to
do
but
loki
thought
it
would
be
worth
while
to
see
if
thrym
knew
anything
about
it
he
went
first
to
asgard
he
hurried
across
the
rainbow
bridge
and
passed
heimdall
without
speaking
to
him
to
none
of
the
dwellers
in
asgard
whom
he
met
did
he
dare
relate
the
tidings
of
thor
loss
he
spoke
to
none
until
he
came
to
frigga
palace
to
frigga
he
said
you
must
lend
me
your
falcon
dress
until
i
fly
to
thrym
dwelling
and
find
out
if
he
knows
where
miölnir
is
if
every
feather
was
silver
i
would
give
it
to
you
to
go
on
such
an
errand
frigga
said
so
loki
put
on
the
falcon
dress
and
flew
to
jötunheim
and
came
near
thrym
dwelling
he
found
the
giant
upon
a
hillside
putting
golden
and
silver
collars
upon
the
necks
of
his
hounds
loki
in
the
plumage
of
a
falcon
perched
on
the
rock
above
him
watching
the
giant
with
falcon
eyes
and
while
he
was
there
he
heard
the
giant
speak
boastful
words
i
put
collars
of
silver
and
gold
on
you
now
my
hounds
said
he
but
soon
we
giants
will
have
the
gold
of
asgard
to
deck
our
hounds
and
our
steeds
yea
even
the
necklace
of
freya
to
put
upon
you
the
best
of
my
hounds
for
miölnir
the
defence
of
asgard
is
in
thrym
holding
then
loki
spoke
to
him
yea
we
know
that
miölnir
is
in
thy
possession
o
thrym
said
he
but
know
thou
that
the
eyes
of
the
watchful
gods
are
upon
thee
ha
loki
said
thrym
you
are
there
but
all
your
watching
will
not
help
you
to
find
miölnir
i
have
buried
thor
hammer
eight
miles
deep
in
the
earth
find
it
if
you
can
it
is
below
the
caves
of
the
dwarfs
it
is
useless
for
us
to
search
for
thor
hammer
said
loki
eh
thrym
it
is
useless
for
you
to
search
for
it
said
the
giant
sulkily
but
what
a
recompense
you
would
gain
if
you
restored
thor
hammer
to
the
dwellers
in
asgard
loki
said
no
cunning
loki
i
will
never
restore
it
not
for
any
recompense
said
thrym
yet
bethink
thee
thrym
said
loki
is
there
nought
in
asgard
you
would
like
to
own
no
treasure
no
possession
odin
ring
or
ship
skidbladnir
no
no
said
thrym
only
one
thing
could
the
dwellers
in
asgard
offer
me
that
i
would
take
in
exchange
for
miölnir
thor
hammer
and
what
would
that
be
thrym
said
loki
flying
toward
him
she
whom
many
giants
have
striven
to
gain
freya
for
my
wife
said
thrym
loki
watched
thrym
for
long
with
his
falcon
eyes
he
saw
that
the
giant
would
not
alter
his
demand
i
will
tell
the
dwellers
in
asgard
of
your
demand
he
said
at
last
and
he
flew
away
loki
knew
that
the
dwellers
in
asgard
would
never
let
freya
be
taken
from
them
to
become
the
wife
of
thrym
the
stupidest
of
the
giants
he
flew
back
by
this
time
all
the
dwellers
in
asgard
had
heard
of
the
loss
of
miölnir
the
help
of
the
gods
heimdall
shouted
to
him
as
he
crossed
the
rainbow
bridge
to
ask
what
tidings
he
brought
back
but
loki
did
not
stop
to
speak
to
the
warden
of
the
bridge
but
went
straight
to
the
hall
where
the
gods
sat
in
council
to
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
he
told
thrym
demand
none
would
agree
to
let
the
beautiful
freya
go
live
in
jötunheim
as
a
wife
to
the
stupidest
of
the
giants
all
in
the
council
were
cast
down
the
gods
would
never
again
be
able
to
help
mortal
men
for
now
that
miölnir
was
in
the
giants
hands
all
their
strength
would
have
to
be
used
in
the
defence
of
asgard
so
they
sat
in
the
council
with
looks
downcast
but
cunning
loki
said
i
have
thought
of
a
trick
that
may
win
back
the
hammer
from
stupid
thrym
let
us
pretend
to
send
freya
to
jötunheim
as
a
bride
for
him
but
let
one
of
the
gods
go
in
freya
veil
and
dress
which
of
the
gods
would
bring
himself
to
do
so
shameful
a
thing
said
those
in
the
council
oh
he
who
lost
the
hammer
thor
should
be
prepared
to
do
as
much
to
win
it
back
said
loki
thor
thor
let
thor
win
back
the
hammer
from
thrym
by
loki
trick
said
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
they
left
it
to
loki
to
arrange
how
thor
should
go
to
jötunheim
as
a
bride
for
thrym
loki
left
the
council
of
the
gods
and
came
to
where
he
had
left
thor
there
is
but
one
way
to
win
the
hammer
back
thor
he
said
and
the
gods
in
council
have
decreed
that
you
shall
take
it
what
is
the
way
said
thor
but
no
matter
what
it
is
tell
me
of
it
and
i
shall
do
as
thou
dost
say
then
said
laughing
loki

am
to
take
you
to
jötunheim
as
a
bride
for
thrym
thou
art
to
go
in
bridal
dress
and

and
bridal
dress

thor
said
the
cunning
loki
so
thor
and
loki
set
out
for
jötunheim
and
the
dwelling
of
thrym
a
messenger
had
gone
before
them
to
tell
thrym
that
freya
was
coming
with
her
bridesmaid
that
the
was
to
be
prepared
and
the
guests
gathered
and
that
miölnir
was
to
be
at
hand
so
that
it
might
be
given
over
to
the
dwellers
in
asgard
thrym
and
his
giant
mother
hastened
to
have
everything
in
readiness
thor
and
loki
came
to
the
giant
house
in
the
dress
of
a
bride
and
a
bridesmaid
a
veil
was
over
thor
head
hiding
his
beard
and
his
fierce
eyes
a
robe
he
wore
and
at
his
side
hung
a
girdle
of
housekeeper
keys
loki
was
veiled
too
the
hall
of
thrym
great
house
was
swept
and
garnished
and
great
tables
were
laid
for
the
feast
and
thrym
mother
was
going
from
one
guest
to
another
vaunting
that
her
son
was
getting
one
of
the
beauteous
dwellers
in
asgard
for
his
bride
freya
whom
so
many
of
the
giants
had
tried
to
win
when
thor
and
loki
stepped
across
the
threshold
thrym
went
to
welcome
them
he
wanted
to
raise
the
veil
of
his
bride
and
give
her
a
kiss
loki
quickly
laid
his
hand
on
the
giant
shoulder
forbear
he
whispered
do
not
raise
her
veil
we
dwellers
in
asgard
are
reserved
and
bashful
freya
would
be
much
offended
to
be
kissed
before
this
company
aye
aye
said
thrym
old
mother
do
not
raise
thy
bride
veil
son
these
dwellers
in
asgard
are
more
refined
in
their
ways
than
we
the
giants
then
the
old
woman
took
thor
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
table
the
size
and
the
girth
of
the
bride
did
not
surprise
the
huge
giants
who
were
in
the
wedding
company
they
stared
at
thor
and
loki
but
they
could
see
nothing
of
their
faces
and
little
of
their
forms
because
of
their
veils
thor
sat
at
the
table
with
thrym
on
one
side
of
him
and
loki
on
the
other
then
the
feast
began
thor
not
noticing
that
what
he
did
was
unbecoming
to
a
refined
maiden
ate
eight
salmon
right
away
loki
nudged
him
and
pressed
his
foot
but
he
did
not
heed
loki
after
the
salmon
he
ate
a
whole
ox
these
maids
of
asgard
said
the
giants
to
each
other
they
may
be
refined
as
thrym
mother
says
but
their
appetites
are
lusty
enough
no
wonder
she
eats
poor
thing
said
loki
to
thrym
it
is
eight
days
since
we
left
asgard
and
freya
never
ate
upon
the
way
so
anxious
was
she
to
see
thrym
and
to
come
to
his
house
poor
darling
poor
darling
said
the
giant
what
she
has
eaten
is
little
after
all
thor
nodded
his
head
toward
the
mead
vat
thrym
ordered
his
servants
to
bring
a
measure
to
his
bride
the
servants
were
kept
coming
with
measures
to
thor
while
the
giants
watched
and
while
loki
nudged
and
nodded
he
drank
three
barrels
of
mead
oh
said
the
giants
to
thrym
mother
we
are
not
so
sorry
that
we
failed
to
win
a
bride
from
asgard
and
now
a
piece
of
the
veil
slipped
aside
and
thor
eyes
were
seen
for
an
instant
oh
how
does
it
come
that
freya
has
such
glaring
eyes
said
thrym
poor
thing
poor
thing
said
loki
no
wonder
her
eyes
are
glaring
and
staring
she
has
not
slept
for
eight
nights
so
anxious
was
she
to
come
to
you
and
to
your
house
thrym
but
now
the
time
has
come
for
you
to
join
hands
with
your
bride
first
put
into
her
hands
the
hammer
miölnir
that
she
may
know
the
great
recompense
that
the
giants
have
given
for
her
coming
then
thrym
the
stupidest
of
the
giants
rose
up
and
brought
miölnir
the
defence
of
asgard
into
the
feasting
hall
thor
could
hardly
restrain
himself
from
springing
up
and
seizing
it
from
the
giant
but
loki
was
able
to
keep
him
still
thrym
brought
over
the
hammer
and
put
the
handle
into
the
hands
of
her
whom
he
thought
was
his
bride
hands
closed
on
his
hammer
instantly
he
stood
up
the
veil
fell
off
him
his
countenance
and
his
blazing
eyes
were
seen
by
all
he
struck
one
blow
on
the
wall
of
the
house
down
it
crashed
then
thor
went
striding
out
of
the
ruin
with
loki
beside
him
while
within
the
giants
bellowed
as
the
roof
and
walls
fell
down
on
them
and
so
was
miölnir
the
defence
of
asgard
lost
and
won
back
illustration
ægir
feast
how
thor
triumphed
the
time
between
midday
and
evening
wore
on
while
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
gathered
for
the
feast
in
old
ægir
hall
listened
to
the
stories
that
loki
told
in
mockery
of
thor
the
night
came
but
no
banquet
was
made
ready
for
the
dwellers
in
asgard
they
called
to
ægir
two
underservants
fimaffenger
and
elder
and
they
bade
them
bring
them
a
supper
slight
was
what
they
got
but
they
went
to
bed
saying
great
must
be
the
preparations
that
old
ægir
is
making
to
feast
us
tomorrow
the
morrow
came
and
the
midday
of
the
morrow
and
still
the
dwellers
in
asgard
saw
no
preparations
being
made
for
the
banquet
then
frey
rose
up
and
went
to
seek
old
ægir
the
giant
king
of
the
sea
he
found
him
sitting
with
bowed
head
in
his
inner
hall
ho
ægir
he
said
what
of
the
banquet
that
you
have
offered
to
the
dwellers
in
asgard
old
ægir
mumbled
and
pulled
at
his
beard
at
last
he
looked
his
guest
in
the
face
and
told
why
the
banquet
was
not
being
made
ready
the
mead
for
the
feast
was
not
yet
brewed
and
there
was
little
chance
of
being
able
to
brew
mead
that
would
do
for
all
for
ægir
hall
was
lacking
a
mead
kettle
that
would
contain
enough
when
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
heard
this
they
were
sorely
disappointed
who
now
outside
of
asgard
would
give
them
a
feast
ægir
was
the
only
one
of
the
giants
who
was
friendly
to
them
and
ægir
could
not
give
them
full
entertainment
then
a
giant
youth
who
was
there
spoke
up
and
said
my
kinsman
the
giant
hrymer
has
a
mead
kettle
that
is
a
mile
wide
if
we
could
bring
hrymer
kettle
here
what
a
feast
we
might
have
one
of
us
can
go
for
that
kettle
frey
said
ah
but
hrymer
dwelling
is
beyond
the
deepest
forest
and
behind
the
highest
mountain
the
giant
youth
said
and
hrymer
himself
is
a
rough
and
a
churlish
one
to
call
on
still
one
of
us
should
go
frey
said
i
will
go
to
hrymer
dwelling
said
thor
standing
up
i
will
go
to
hrymer
dwelling
and
get
the
kettle
from
him
by
force
or
cunning
he
had
been
sitting
subdued
under
the
mocking
tales
that
loki
told
of
him
and
he
was
pleased
with
this
chance
to
make
his
prowess
plain
to
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
he
buckled
on
the
belt
that
doubled
his
strength
he
drew
on
the
iron
gloves
that
enabled
him
to
grasp
miölnir
he
took
his
hammer
in
his
hands
and
he
signed
to
the
giant
youth
to
come
with
him
and
be
his
guide
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
applauded
thor
as
he
stepped
out
of
old
hall
but
loki
mischievous
loki
threw
a
gibe
after
him
do
not
let
the
hammer
out
of
your
hands
this
time
bride
of
thrym
he
shouted
thor
with
the
giant
youth
to
guide
him
went
through
the
deepest
forest
and
over
the
highest
mountain
he
came
at
last
to
the
giant
dwelling
on
a
hillock
before
hrymer
house
was
a
dreadful
warden
a
giant
crone
she
was
with
heads
growing
out
of
her
shoulders
she
was
squatting
down
on
her
ankles
and
her
heads
growing
in
bunches
were
looking
in
different
directions
as
thor
and
the
giant
youth
came
near
screams
and
yelps
came
from
all
her
heads
thor
grasped
his
hammer
and
would
have
flung
it
at
her
if
a
giant
woman
making
a
sign
of
peace
had
not
come
to
the
door
of
the
dwelling
the
youthful
giant
who
was
with
thor
greeted
her
as
his
mother
son
come
within
said
she
and
you
may
bring
your
fellow
farer
with
you
the
giant
crone
she
was
hrymer
grandmother
kept
up
her
screaming
and
yelping
but
thor
went
past
her
and
into
the
giant
dwelling
when
she
saw
that
it
was
one
of
the
dwellers
in
asgard
who
had
come
with
her
son
the
giant
woman
grew
fearful
for
them
both
hrymer
she
said
will
be
in
a
rage
to
find
one
of
the
æsir
under
his
roof
he
will
strive
to
slay
you
it
is
not
likely
he
will
succeed
thor
said
grasping
miölnir
the
hammer
that
all
the
giant
race
knew
of
and
dreaded
hide
from
him
said
the
giant
woman
he
may
injure
my
son
in
his
rage
to
find
you
here
i
am
not
wont
to
hide
from
the
giants
thor
said
hide
only
for
a
little
while
hide
until
hrymer
has
eaten
the
giant
woman
pleaded
he
comes
back
from
the
chase
in
a
stormy
temper
after
he
has
eaten
he
is
easier
to
deal
with
hide
until
he
has
finished
supper
thor
at
last
agreed
to
do
this
he
and
the
giant
youth
hid
behind
a
pillar
in
the
hall
they
were
barely
hidden
when
they
heard
the
clatter
of
the
giant
steps
as
he
came
through
the
courtyard
he
came
to
the
door
his
beard
was
like
a
frozen
forest
around
his
mouth
and
he
dragged
along
with
him
a
wild
bull
that
he
had
captured
in
the
chase
so
proud
was
he
of
his
capture
that
he
dragged
it
into
the
hall
i
have
taken
alive
he
shouted
the
bull
with
the
mightiest
head
and
horns
this
bull
is
called
no
giant
but
me
could
capture
it
he
tied
the
bull
to
the
post
of
the
door
and
then
his
eyes
went
toward
the
pillar
behind
which
thor
and
the
giant
youth
were
hiding
the
pillar
split
up
its
whole
length
at
that
look
from
eyes
he
came
nearer
the
pillar
of
stone
broke
across
it
fell
with
the
crossbeam
it
supported
and
all
the
kettles
and
cauldrons
that
were
hanging
on
the
beam
came
down
with
a
terrible
rattle
then
thor
stepped
out
and
faced
the
wrathful
giant
it
is
i
who
am
here
friend
hrymer
he
said
his
hands
resting
on
his
hammer
then
hrymer
who
knew
thor
and
knew
the
force
of
thor
hammer
drew
back
now
that
you
are
in
my
house
asa
thor
he
said
i
will
not
quarrel
with
you
make
supper
ready
for

thor
and
your
son
and
myself
said
he
to
the
giant
woman
a
plentiful
supper
was
spread
and
hrymer
and
thor
and
the
giant
youth
sat
down
to
three
whole
roast
oxen
thor
ate
the
whole
of
one
ox
hrymer
who
had
eaten
nearly
two
himself
leaving
only
small
cuts
for
his
wife
and
his
youthful
kinsman
grumbled
at
thor
appetite
clear
my
fields
asa
thor
he
said
if
you
stay
long
with
me
do
not
grumble
hrymer
thor
said
tomorrow

fishing
and

you
back
the
weight
of

tomorrow
asa
thor
said
hrymer
and
do
be
frightened
if
i
take
you
out
on
a
rough
sea
hrymer
was
first
out
of
bed
the
next
morning
he
came
with
the
pole
and
the
ropes
in
his
hand
to
where
thor
was
sleeping
time
to
start
earning
your
meal
asa
thor
said
he
thor
got
out
of
bed
and
when
they
were
both
in
the
courtyard
the
giant
said
you
have
to
provide
a
bait
for
yourself
mind
that
you
take
a
bait
large
enough
it
is
not
where
the
little
fishes
are
the
place
where
i
going
to
take
you
if
you
never
saw
monsters
before
you
see
them
now
i
glad
asa
thor
that
you
spoke
of
going
fishing
will
this
bait
be
big
enough
said
thor
laying
his
hands
on
the
horns
of
the
bull
that
hrymer
had
captured
and
brought
home
the
bull
with
the
mighty
head
of
horns
that
was
called
will
this
bait
be
big
enough
do
you
think
yes
if
you
big
enough
to
handle
it
said
the
giant
thor
said
nothing
but
he
struck
the
bull
full
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
with
his
fist
the
great
creature
fell
down
dead
thor
then
twisted
the
bull
head
off
i
have
my
bait
and
i
ready
to
go
with
you
hrymer
he
said
hrymer
had
turned
away
to
hide
the
rage
he
was
in
at
seeing
thor
do
such
a
feat
he
walked
down
to
the
boat
without
speaking
you
may
row
for
the
first
few
strokes
said
hrymer
when
they
were
in
the
boat
but
when
we
come
to
where
the
ocean
is
rough
why
i
take
the
oars
from
you
without
saying
a
word
thor
made
a
few
strokes
that
took
the
boat
out
into
the
middle
of
the
ocean
hrymer
was
in
a
rage
to
think
that
he
could
not
show
himself
greater
than
thor
he
let
out
his
line
and
began
to
fish
soon
he
felt
something
huge
on
his
hook
the
boat
rocked
and
rocked
till
thor
steadied
it
then
hrymer
drew
into
the
boat
the
largest
whale
that
was
in
these
seas
good
fishing
said
thor
as
he
put
his
own
bait
on
the
line
it
something
for
you
to
tell
the
æsir
said
hrymer
i
thought
as
you
were
here
i
show
you
something
bigger
than
i
try
my
luck
now
said
thor
he
threw
out
a
line
that
had
at
the
end
of
it
the
head
of
the
great
bull
down
down
the
head
went
it
passed
where
the
whales
swim
and
the
whales
were
afraid
to
gulp
at
the
mighty
horns
down
down
it
went
till
it
came
near
where
the
monster
serpent
that
coils
itself
round
the
world
abides
it
reared
its
head
up
from
its
serpent
coils
as
thor
bait
came
down
through
the
depths
of
the
ocean
it
gulped
at
the
head
and
drew
it
into
its
gullet
there
the
great
hook
stuck
terribly
surprised
was
the
serpent
monster
it
lashed
the
ocean
into
a
fury
but
still
the
hook
stayed
then
it
strove
to
draw
down
to
the
depths
of
the
ocean
the
boat
of
those
who
had
hooked
it
thor
put
his
legs
across
the
boat
and
stretched
them
till
they
touched
the
bottom
bed
of
the
ocean
on
the
bottom
bed
of
the
ocean
thor
stood
and
he
pulled
and
he
pulled
on
his
line
the
serpent
monster
lashed
the
ocean
into
fiercer
and
fiercer
storms
and
all
the
world
ships
were
hurled
against
each
other
and
wrecked
and
tossed
but
it
had
to
loosen
coil
after
coil
of
the
coils
it
makes
around
the
world
thor
pulled
and
pulled
then
the
terrible
head
of
the
serpent
monster
appeared
above
the
waters
it
reared
over
the
boat
that
hrymer
sat
in
and
that
thor
straddled
across
thor
dropped
the
line
and
took
up
miölnir
his
mighty
hammer
he
raised
it
to
strike
the
head
of
the
serpent
monster
whose
coils
go
round
the
world
but
hrymer
would
not
have
that
happen
rather
than
have
thor
pass
him
by
such
a
feat
he
cut
the
line
and
the
head
of
the
serpent
monster
sank
back
into
the
sea
thor
hammer
was
raised
he
hurled
it
hurled
that
hammer
that
always
came
back
to
his
hand
it
followed
the
sinking
head
through
fathom
after
fathom
of
the
ocean
depth
it
struck
the
serpent
monster
a
blow
but
not
such
a
deadly
blow
as
would
have
been
struck
if
the
water
had
not
come
between
a
bellow
of
pain
came
up
from
the
depths
of
the
ocean
such
a
bellow
of
pain
that
all
in
jötunheim
were
affrighted
this
surely
is
something
to
tell
the
æsir
of
said
thor
something
to
make
them
forget
loki
mockeries
without
speaking
hrymer
turned
the
boat
and
rowed
toward
the
shore
dragging
the
whale
in
the
wake
he
was
in
such
a
rage
to
think
that
one
of
the
æsir
had
done
a
feat
surpassing
his
that
he
would
not
speak
at
supper
too
he
remained
silent
but
thor
talked
for
two
boasting
loudly
of
his
triumph
over
the
monster
serpent
no
doubt
you
think
yourself
very
powerful
asa
thor
hrymer
said
at
last
well
do
you
think
you
are
powerful
enough
to
break
the
cup
that
is
before
you
thor
took
up
the
cup
and
with
a
laugh
he
hurled
it
against
the
stone
pillar
of
the
house
the
cup
fell
down
on
the
floor
without
a
crack
or
a
dint
in
it
but
the
pillar
was
shattered
with
the
blow
the
giant
laughed
so
feeble
are
the
folk
of
asgard
he
said
thor
took
up
the
cup
again
and
flung
it
with
greater
force
against
the
stone
pillar
and
again
the
cup
fell
to
the
ground
without
a
crack
or
a
dint
then
he
heard
the
woman
who
was
the
mother
of
the
giant
youth
sing
softly
as
she
plied
her
wheel
behind
him
not
at
the
pillar
of
the
stead
but
at
hrymer
massy
head
when
you
next
the
goblet
throw
let
his
head
receive
the
blow
thor
took
the
cup
up
again
he
flung
it
not
at
the
pillar
this
time
but
at
hrymer
head
it
struck
the
giant
full
on
the
forehead
and
fell
down
on
the
floor
in
pieces
and
hrymer
head
was
left
without
a
dint
or
a
crack
ha
so
you
can
break
a
cup
but
can
you
lift
up
my
kettle
cried
the
giant
show
me
where
your
kettle
is
and
i
shall
try
to
lift
it
cried
thor
the
giant
took
up
the
flooring
and
showed
him
the
kettle
down
in
the
cellar
thor
stooped
down
and
took
the
kettle
by
the
brim
he
lifted
it
slowly
as
if
with
a
mighty
effort
you
can
lift
but
can
you
carry
it
said
the
giant
i
will
try
to
do
that
said
thor
he
lifted
the
kettle
up
and
placed
it
on
his
head
he
strode
to
the
door
and
out
of
the
house
before
the
giant
could
lay
hands
on
him
then
when
he
was
outside
he
started
to
run
he
was
across
the
mountain
before
he
looked
behind
him
he
heard
a
yelping
and
a
screaming
and
he
saw
the
giant
crone
with
the
bunch
of
heads
running
running
after
him
up
hill
and
down
dale
thor
raced
the
kettle
on
his
head
and
the
giant
crone
in
chase
of
him
through
the
deep
forest
he
ran
and
over
the
high
mountain
but
still
kept
him
in
chase
but
at
last
jumping
over
a
lake
she
fell
in
and
thor
was
free
of
his
pursuer
and
so
back
to
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
thor
came
in
triumph
carrying
on
his
head
the
kettle
and
those
of
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
who
had
laughed
most
at
loki
mockeries
rose
up
and
cheered
for
him
as
he
came
in
the
mead
was
brewed
the
feast
was
spread
and
the
greatest
banquet
that
ever
the
kings
of
the
giants
gave
to
the
dwellers
in
asgard
was
eaten
in
gladness
a
strange
and
silent
figure
sat
at
the
banquet
it
was
the
figure
of
a
giant
and
no
one
knew
who
he
was
nor
where
he
had
come
from
but
when
the
banquet
was
ended
odin
the
eldest
of
the
gods
turned
toward
this
figure
and
said
o
skyrmir
giant
king
of
utgard
rise
up
now
and
tell
thor
of
all
you
practiced
upon
him
when
he
and
loki
came
to
your
city
then
the
stranger
at
the
banquet
stood
up
and
thor
and
loki
saw
he
was
the
giant
king
in
whose
halls
they
had
had
the
contests
skyrmir
turned
toward
them
and
said
o
thor
and
o
loki
i
will
reveal
to
you
now
the
deceits
i
practiced
on
you
both
it
was
i
whom
ye
met
on
the
moorland
on
the
day
before
ye
came
into
utgard
i
gave
you
my
name
as
skyrmir
and
i
did
all
i
might
do
to
prevent
your
entering
our
city
for
the
giants
dreaded
a
contest
of
strength
with
asa
thor
now
hear
me
o
thor
the
wallet
i
gave
for
you
to
take
provisions
out
of
was
tied
with
magic
knots
no
one
could
undo
them
by
strength
or
cleverness
and
while
you
were
striving
to
undo
them
i
placed
a
mountain
of
rock
between
myself
and
you
the
hammer
blows
which
as
you
thought
struck
me
struck
the
mountain
and
made
great
clefts
and
gaps
in
it
when
i
knew
the
strength
of
your
tremendous
blows
i
was
more
and
more
in
dread
of
your
coming
into
our
city
i
saw
you
would
have
to
be
deceived
by
magic
your
lad
thialfi
was
the
one
whom
i
first
deceived
for
it
was
not
a
giant
youth
who
raced
against
him
but
thought
itself
and
even
you
o
loki
i
deceived
for
when
you
tried
to
make
yourself
out
the
greatest
of
eaters
i
pitted
against
you
not
a
giant
but
fire
that
devours
everything
you
thor
were
deceived
in
all
the
contests
after
you
had
taken
the
drinking
horn
in
your
hands
we
were
all
affrighted
to
see
how
much
you
were
able
to
gulp
down
for
the
end
of
that
horn
was
in
the
sea
and
ægir
who
is
here
can
tell
you
that
after
you
had
drunk
from
it
the
level
of
the
sea
went
down
the
cat
whom
you
strove
to
lift
was
nidhögg
the
dragon
that
gnaws
at
the
roots
of
ygdrassil
the
tree
of
trees
truly
we
were
terrified
when
we
saw
that
you
made
nidhögg
budge
when
you
made
the
back
of
the
cat
reach
the
roof
of
our
palace
we
said
to
ourselves
is
the
mightiest
of
all
the
beings
we
have
known
lastly
you
strove
with
the
hag
ellie
her
strength
seemed
marvelous
to
you
and
you
thought
yourself
disgraced
because
you
could
not
throw
her
but
know
thor
that
ellie
whom
you
wrestled
with
was
old
age
herself
we
were
terrified
again
to
see
that
she
who
can
overthrow
all
was
not
able
to
force
you
prone
upon
the
ground
so
skyrmir
spoke
and
then
left
the
hall
and
once
more
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
stood
up
and
cheered
for
thor
the
strongest
of
all
who
guarded
asgard
illustration
the
dwarf
hoard
and
the
curse
that
it
brought
now
old
ægir
feast
was
over
and
all
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
made
ready
for
their
return
to
asgard
two
only
went
on
another
way
odin
the
eldest
of
the
gods
and
loki
the
mischievous
loki
and
odin
laid
aside
all
that
they
had
kept
of
the
divine
power
and
the
divine
strength
they
were
going
into
the
world
of
men
and
they
would
be
as
men
merely
together
they
went
through
midgard
mingling
with
men
of
all
sorts
kings
and
farmers
outlaws
and
true
men
warriors
and
householders
thralls
and
councillors
courteous
men
and
men
who
were
one
day
they
came
to
the
bank
of
a
mighty
river
and
there
they
rested
listening
to
the
beat
of
iron
upon
iron
in
a
place
near
by
presently
on
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
river
they
saw
an
otter
come
the
otter
went
into
the
water
and
came
back
to
the
rock
with
a
catch
of
salmon
he
devoured
it
there
then
odin
saw
loki
do
a
senseless
and
an
evil
thing
taking
up
a
great
stone
he
flung
it
at
the
otter
the
stone
struck
the
beast
on
the
skull
and
knocked
him
over
dead
loki
loki
why
hast
thou
done
a
thing
so
senseless
and
so
evil
odin
said
loki
only
laughed
he
swam
across
the
water
and
came
back
with
the
creature
of
the
river
why
didst
thou
take
the
life
of
the
beast
odin
said
the
mischief
in
me
made
me
do
it
said
loki
he
drew
out
his
knife
and
ripping
the
otter
up
he
began
to
flay
him
when
the
skin
was
off
the
beast
he
folded
it
up
and
stuck
it
in
his
belt
then
odin
and
he
left
that
place
by
the
river
they
came
to
a
house
with
two
smithies
beside
it
and
from
the
smithies
came
the
sound
of
iron
beating
upon
iron
they
went
within
the
house
and
they
asked
that
they
might
eat
there
and
rest
themselves
an
old
man
who
was
cooking
fish
over
a
fire
pointed
out
a
bench
to
them
rest
there
said
he
and
when
the
fish
is
cooked
i
will
give
you
something
good
to
eat
my
son
is
a
fine
fisher
and
he
brings
me
salmon
of
the
best
odin
and
loki
sat
on
the
bench
and
the
old
man
went
on
with
his
cooking
my
name
is
hreidmar
he
said
and
i
have
two
sons
who
work
in
the
smithies
without
i
have
a
third
son
also
it
is
he
who
does
the
fishing
for
us
and
who
may
ye
be
o
wayfaring
men
loki
and
odin
gave
names
to
hreidmar
that
were
not
the
names
by
which
they
were
known
in
asgard
or
on
midgard
hreidmar
served
fish
to
them
and
they
ate
and
what
adventures
have
ye
met
upon
your
travels
hreidmar
asked
few
folk
come
this
way
to
tell
me
of
happenings
i
killed
an
otter
with
a
cast
of
a
stone
loki
said
with
a
laugh
you
killed
an
otter
hreidmar
cried
where
did
you
kill
one
where
i
killed
him
is
of
no
import
to
you
old
man
said
loki
his
skin
is
a
good
one
however
i
have
it
at
my
belt
hreidmar
snatched
the
skin
out
of
loki
belt
as
soon
as
he
held
the
skin
before
his
eyes
he
shrieked
out
fafnir
regin
my
sons
come
here
and
bring
the
thralls
of
your
smithies
come
come
come
why
dost
thou
make
such
an
outcry
old
man
said
odin
ye
have
slain
my
son
otter
shrieked
the
old
man
this
in
my
hands
is
the
skin
of
my
son
as
hreidmar
said
this
two
young
men
bearing
the
forehammers
of
the
smithies
came
in
followed
by
the
thralls
strike
these
men
dead
with
your
forehammers
o
fafnir
o
regin
their
father
cried
otter
who
used
to
stay
in
the
river
and
whom
i
changed
by
enchantment
into
a
river
beast
that
he
might
fish
for
me
has
been
slain
by
these
men
peace
said
odin
we
have
slain
thy
son
it
would
seem
but
it
was
unwittingly
that
we
did
the
deed
we
will
give
a
recompense
for
the
death
of
thy
son
what
recompense
will
ye
give
said
hreidmar
looking
at
odin
with
eyes
that
were
small
and
sharp
then
did
odin
the
eldest
of
the
gods
say
a
word
that
was
unworthy
of
his
wisdom
and
his
power
he
might
have
said
i
will
bring
thee
a
draught
of
mimir
well
water
as
a
recompense
for
thy
son
death
but
instead
of
thinking
of
wisdom
odin
thought
of
gold
set
a
price
on
the
life
of
thy
son
and
we
will
pay
that
price
in
gold
he
said
maybe
ye
are
great
kings
traveling
through
the
world
hreidmar
said
if
ye
are
ye
will
have
to
find
gold
that
will
cover
every
hair
upon
the
skin
of
him
whom
ye
have
killed
then
did
odin
his
mind
being
fixed
upon
the
gold
think
upon
a
certain
treasure
a
treasure
that
was
guarded
by
a
dwarf
no
other
treasure
in
the
nine
worlds
would
be
great
enough
to
make
the
recompense
that
hreidmar
claimed
he
thought
upon
this
treasure
and
he
thought
on
how
it
might
be
taken
and
yet
he
was
ashamed
of
his
thought
dost
thou
loki
know
of
andvari
hoard
he
said
i
know
of
it
said
loki
sharply
and
i
know
where
it
is
hidden
wilt
thou
odin
win
leave
for
me
to
fetch
andvari
hoard
odin
spoke
to
hreidmar
i
will
stay
with
thee
as
a
hostage
he
said
if
thou
wilt
let
this
one
go
to
fetch
a
treasure
that
will
cover
the
otter
skin
hair
by
hair
i
will
let
this
be
done
said
old
hreidmar
with
the
sharp
and
cunning
eyes
go
now
said
he
to
loki
then
loki
went
from
the
house
andvari
was
a
dwarf
who
in
the
early
days
had
gained
for
himself
the
greatest
treasure
in
the
nine
worlds
so
that
he
might
guard
this
treasure
unceasingly
he
changed
himself
into
a
fish
into
a
pike
and
he
swam
in
the
water
before
the
cave
where
the
hoard
was
hidden
all
in
asgard
knew
of
the
dwarf
and
of
the
hoard
he
guarded
and
there
was
a
thought
amongst
all
that
this
hoard
was
not
to
be
meddled
with
and
that
some
evil
was
joined
to
it
but
now
odin
had
given
the
word
that
it
was
to
be
taken
from
the
dwarf
loki
set
out
for
andvari
cave
rejoicingly
he
came
to
the
pool
before
the
cave
and
he
watched
for
a
sight
of
andvari
soon
he
saw
the
pike
swimming
cautiously
before
the
cave
he
would
have
to
catch
the
pike
and
hold
him
till
the
treasure
was
given
for
ransom
as
he
watched
the
pike
became
aware
of
him
suddenly
he
flung
himself
forward
in
the
water
and
went
with
speed
down
the
stream
not
with
his
hands
and
not
with
any
hook
and
line
could
loki
catch
that
pike
how
then
could
he
take
him
only
with
a
net
that
was
woven
by
magic
then
loki
thought
of
where
he
might
get
such
a
net
ran
the
wife
of
old
ægir
the
giant
king
of
the
sea
had
a
net
that
was
woven
by
magic
in
it
she
took
all
that
was
wrecked
on
the
sea
loki
thought
of
ran
net
and
he
turned
and
went
back
to
ægir
hall
to
ask
for
the
queen
but
ran
was
seldom
in
her
husband
dwelling
she
was
now
down
by
the
rocks
of
the
sea
he
found
ran
the
cold
queen
standing
in
the
flow
of
the
sea
drawing
out
of
the
depths
with
the
net
that
she
held
in
her
hands
every
piece
of
treasure
that
was
washed
that
way
she
had
made
a
heap
of
the
things
she
had
drawn
out
of
the
sea
corals
and
amber
and
bits
of
gold
and
silver
but
still
she
was
plying
her
net
greedily

the
dwarf
who

sea
said
loki
the
cold
queen
of
the
sea
ceased
plying
her
net
she
looked
at
loki
steadily
yes
if
he
were
going
to
catch
andvari
she
would
lend
her
net
to
him
she
hated
all
the
dwarfs
because
this
one
and
that
one
had
told
her
they
had
greater
treasures
than
ever
she
would
be
mistress
of
but
especially
she
hated
andvari
the
dwarf
who
had
the
greatest
treasure
in
the
nine
worlds
there
is
nothing
more
to
gather
here
she
said
and
if

net
by

i
shall
lend
it
to
you
i
swear

by
tomorrow
o
queen
of
ægir
loki
cried
then
ran
put
into
his
hands
the
magic
net
back
then
he
went
to
where
the
dwarf
transformed
was
guarding
his
wondrous
hoard
dark
was
the
pool
in
which
andvari
floated
as
a
pike
dark
it
was
but
to
him
it
was
all
golden
with
the
light
of
his
wondrous
treasure
for
the
sake
of
this
hoard
he
had
given
up
his
companionship
with
the
dwarfs
and
his
delight
in
making
and
shaping
the
things
of
their
workmanship
for
the
sake
of
his
hoard
he
had
taken
on
himself
the
dumbness
and
deafness
of
a
fish
now
as
he
swam
about
before
the
cave
he
was
aware
again
of
a
shadow
above
him
he
slipped
toward
the
shadow
of
the
bank
then
as
he
turned
round
he
saw
a
net
sweeping
toward
him
he
sank
down
in
the
water
but
the
magic
net
had
spread
out
and
he
sank
into
its
meshes
suddenly
he
was
out
of
the
water
and
was
left
gasping
on
the
bank
he
would
have
died
had
he
not
undone
his
transformation
soon
he
appeared
as
a
dwarf
andvari
you
are
caught
it
is
one
of
the
æsir
who
has
taken
you
he
heard
his
captor
say
loki
he
gasped
thou
art
caught
and
thou
shalt
be
held
loki
said
to
him
it
is
the
will
of
the
æsir
that
thou
give
up
thy
hoard
to
me
my
hoard
my
hoard
the
dwarf
shouted
never
will
i
give
up
my
hoard
i
hold
thee
till
thou
givest
it
to
me
said
loki
unjust
unjust
shouted
andvari
it
is
only
thou
loki
who
art
unjust
i
will
go
to
the
throne
of
odin
and
i
will
have
odin
punish
thee
for
striving
to
rob
me
of
my
treasure
odin
has
sent
me
to
fetch
thy
hoard
to
him
said
loki
can
it
be
that
all
the
æsir
are
unjust
ah
yes
in
the
beginning
of
things
they
cheated
the
giant
who
built
the
wall
round
their
city
the
æsir
are
unjust
loki
had
andvari
in
his
power
and
after
the
dwarf
had
raged
against
him
and
defied
him
he
tormented
him
at
last
trembling
with
rage
and
with
his
face
covered
with
tears
andvari
took
loki
into
his
cavern
and
turning
a
rock
aside
showed
him
the
mass
of
gold
and
gems
that
was
his
hoard
at
once
loki
began
to
gather
into
the
magic
net
lumps
and
ingots
and
circlets
of
gold
with
gems
that
were
rubies
and
sapphires
and
emeralds
he
saw
andvari
snatch
at
something
on
the
heap
but
he
made
no
sign
of
marking
it
at
last
all
was
gathered
into
the
net
and
loki
stood
there
ready
to
bear
the
dwarf
hoard
away
there
is
one
thing
more
to
be
given
said
loki
the
ring
that
you
andvari
snatched
from
the
heap
i
snatched
nothing
said
the
dwarf
but
he
shook
with
anger
and
his
teeth
gnashed
together
and
froth
came
on
his
lips
i
snatched
nothing
from
the
heap
but
loki
pulled
up
his
arm
and
there
fell
to
the
ground
the
ring
that
andvari
had
hidden
under
his
armpit
it
was
the
most
precious
thing
in
all
the
hoard
had
it
been
left
with
him
andvari
would
have
thought
that
he
still
possessed
a
treasure
for
this
ring
of
itself
could
make
gold
it
was
made
out
of
gold
that
was
refined
of
all
impurities
and
it
was
engraven
with
a
rune
of
power
loki
took
up
this
most
precious
ring
and
put
it
on
his
finger
then
the
dwarf
screamed
at
him
turning
his
thumbs
toward
him
in
a
curse
the
ring
with
the
rune
of
power
upon
it
may
it
weigh
down
your
fortune
and
load
you
with
evil
you
loki
and
all
who
lust
to
possess
the
ring
i
have
cherished
as
andvari
uttered
this
curse
loki
saw
a
figure
rise
up
in
the
cave
and
move
toward
him
as
this
figure
came
near
he
knew
who
it
was
gulveig
a
giant
woman
who
had
once
been
in
asgard
far
back
in
the
early
days
when
the
gods
had
come
to
their
holy
hill
and
before
asgard
was
built
three
women
of
the
giants
had
come
amongst
the
æsir
after
the
three
had
been
with
them
for
a
time
the
lives
of
the
æsir
changed
then
did
they
begin
to
value
and
to
hoard
the
gold
that
they
had
played
with
then
did
they
think
of
war
odin
hurled
his
spear
amongst
the
messengers
that
came
from
the
vanir
and
war
came
into
the
world
the
three
were
driven
out
of
asgard
peace
was
made
with
the
vanir
the
apples
of
lasting
youth
were
grown
in
asgard
the
eagerness
for
gold
was
curbed
but
never
again
were
the
æsir
as
happy
as
they
were
before
the
women
came
to
them
from
the
giants
gulveig
was
one
of
the
three
who
had
blighted
the
early
happiness
of
the
gods
and
behold
she
was
in
the
cave
where
andvari
had
hoarded
his
treasure
and
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
she
was
advancing
toward
loki
so
loki
she
said
thou
seest
me
again
and
odin
who
sent
thee
to
this
cave
will
see
me
again
lo
loki
i
go
to
odin
to
be
thy
messenger
and
to
tell
him
that
thou
comest
with
andvari
hoard
and
speaking
so
and
smiling
into
his
face
gulveig
went
out
of
the
cave
with
swift
and
light
steps
loki
drew
the
ends
of
the
magic
net
together
and
gathering
all
the
treasures
in
its
meshes
he
too
went
out
odin
the
eldest
of
the
gods
stood
leaning
on
his
spear
and
looking
at
the
skin
of
the
otter
that
was
spread
out
before
him
one
came
into
the
dwelling
swiftly
odin
looked
and
saw
that
she
who
had
come
in
on
such
swift
glad
feet
was
gulveig
who
once
with
her
two
companions
had
troubled
the
happiness
of
the
gods
odin
raised
his
spear
to
cast
it
at
her
lay
thy
spear
down
odin
she
said
i
dwelt
for
long
in
the
cave
but
thy
word
unloosed
me
and
the
curse
said
over
andvari
ring
has
sent
me
here
lay
thy
spear
down
and
look
on
me
o
eldest
of
the
gods
thou
didst
cast
me
out
of
asgard
but
thy
word
has
brought
me
to
come
back
to
thee
and
if
ye
two
odin
and
loki
have
bought
yourselves
free
with
gold
and
may
enter
asgard
surely
i
gulveig
am
free
to
enter
asgard
also
odin
lowered
his
spear
sighing
deeply
surely
it
is
so
gulveig
he
said
i
may
not
forbid
thee
to
enter
asgard
would
i
had
thought
of
giving
the
man
kvasir
mead
or
mimir
well
water
rather
than
this
gold
as
a
recompense
as
they
spoke
loki
came
into
hreidmar
dwelling
he
laid
on
the
floor
the
magic
net
old
hreidmar
with
his
sharp
eyes
and
huge
fafnir
and
lean
and
regin
came
in
to
gaze
on
the
gold
and
gems
that
shone
through
the
meshes
they
began
to
push
each
other
away
from
gazing
at
the
gold
then
hreidmar
cried
out
no
one
may
be
here
but
these
two
kings
and
i
while
we
measure
out
the
gold
and
gems
and
see
whether
the
recompense
be
sufficient
go
without
go
without
sons
of
mine
then
fafnir
and
regin
were
forced
to
go
out
of
the
dwelling
they
went
out
slowly
and
gulveig
went
with
them
whispering
to
both
with
shaking
hands
old
hreidmar
spread
out
the
skin
that
once
covered
his
son
he
drew
out
the
ears
and
the
tail
and
the
paws
so
that
every
single
hair
could
be
shown
for
long
he
was
on
his
hands
and
knees
his
sharp
eyes
searching
searching
over
every
line
of
the
skin
and
still
on
his
knees
he
said
begin
now
o
kings
and
cover
with
a
gem
or
a
piece
of
gold
every
hair
on
the
skin
that
was
my
son
odin
stood
leaning
on
his
spear
watching
the
gold
and
gems
being
paid
out
loki
took
the
gold
the
ingots
and
the
lumps
and
the
circlets
he
took
the
gems
the
rubies
and
the
emeralds
and
the
sapphires
and
he
began
to
place
them
over
each
hair
soon
the
middle
of
the
skin
was
all
covered
then
he
put
the
gems
and
the
gold
over
the
paws
and
the
tail
soon
the
was
so
glittering
that
one
would
think
it
could
light
up
the
world
and
still
loki
went
on
finding
a
place
where
a
gem
or
a
piece
of
gold
might
be
put
at
last
he
stood
up
every
gem
and
every
piece
of
gold
had
been
taken
out
of
the
net
and
every
hair
on
the
otter
skin
had
been
covered
with
a
gem
or
a
piece
of
gold
and
still
old
hreidmar
on
his
hands
and
knees
was
peering
over
the
skin
searching
searching
for
a
hair
that
was
not
covered
at
last
he
lifted
himself
up
on
his
knees
his
mouth
was
open
but
he
was
speechless
he
touched
odin
on
the
knees
and
when
odin
bent
down
he
showed
him
a
hair
upon
the
lip
that
was
left
uncovered
what
meanest
thou
loki
cried
turning
upon
the
crouching
man
your
ransom
is
not
paid
yet
look
here
is
still
a
hair
uncovered
you
may
not
go
until
every
hair
is
covered
with
gold
or
a
gem
peace
old
man
said
loki
roughly
all
the
dwarf
hoard
has
been
given
thee
ye
may
not
go
until
every
hair
has
been
covered
hreidmar
said
again
there
is
no
more
gold
or
gems
loki
answered
then
ye
may
not
go
cried
hreidmar
springing
up
it
was
true
odin
and
loki
might
not
leave
that
dwelling
until
the
recompense
they
had
agreed
to
was
paid
in
full
where
now
would
the
æsir
go
for
gold
and
then
odin
saw
the
gleam
of
gold
on
loki
finger
it
was
the
ring
he
had
forced
from
andvari
thy
fingerring
said
odin
put
thy
fingerring
over
the
hair
on
the
otter
skin
loki
took
off
the
ring
that
was
engraved
with
the
rune
of
power
and
he
put
it
on
the
of
the
otter
skin
then
hreidmar
clapped
his
hands
and
screamed
aloud
huge
fafnir
and
lean
and
regin
came
within
and
gulveig
came
behind
them
they
stood
around
the
skin
of
the
son
and
the
brother
that
was
all
glittering
with
gold
and
gems
but
they
looked
at
each
other
more
than
they
looked
on
the
glittering
mass
and
very
deadly
were
the
looks
that
fafnir
and
regin
cast
upon
their
father
and
cast
upon
each
other
over
bifröst
the
rainbow
bridge
went
all
of

and
the
vanir
that
had
been
at

and
sif
tyr
with
his
sword
and
thor
in
his
chariot
drawn
by
the
goats
loki
came
behind
them
and
behind
them
all
came
odin
the
father
of
the
gods
he
went
slowly
with
his
head
bent
for
he
knew
that
an
unwelcome
one
was
following
gulveig
who
once
had
been
cast
out
of
asgard
and
whose
return
now
the
gods
might
not
gainsay
part
iii
the
witch
heart
illustration
foreboding
in
asgard
what
happened
afterwards
is
to
the
shame
of
the
gods
and
mortals
may
hardly
speak
of
it
gulveig
the
witch
came
into
asgard
for
heimdall
might
not
forbid
her
entrance
she
came
within
and
she
had
her
seat
amongst
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
she
walked
through
asgard
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
and
where
she
walked
and
where
she
smiled
care
and
dire
foreboding
came
those
who
felt
the
care
and
the
foreboding
most
deeply
were
bragi
the
poet
and
his
wife
the
fair
and
simple
iduna
she
who
gathered
the
apples
that
kept
age
from
the
dwellers
in
asgard
bragi
ceased
to
tell
his
tale
then
one
day
overcome
by
the
fear
and
the
foreboding
that
was
creeping
through
asgard
iduna
slipped
down
ygdrassil
the
world
tree
and
no
one
was
left
to
pluck
the
apples
with
which
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
stayed
their
youth
then
were
all
the
dwellers
in
asgard
in
sore
dismay
strength
and
beauty
began
to
fade
from
all
thor
found
it
hard
to
lift
miölnir
his
great
hammer
and
the
flesh
under
freya
necklace
lost
its
white
radiance
and
still
gulveig
the
witch
walked
smiling
through
asgard
although
now
she
was
hated
by
all
it
was
odin
and
frey
who
went
in
search
of
iduna
she
would
have
been
found
and
brought
back
without
delay
if
frey
had
had
with
him
the
magic
sword
that
he
had
bartered
for
gerda
in
his
search
he
had
to
strive
with
one
who
guarded
the
lake
wherein
iduna
had
hidden
herself
beli
was
the
one
he
strove
against
he
overcame
him
in
the
end
with
a
weapon
made
of
stags
antlers
ah
it
was
not
then
but
later
that
frey
lamented
the
loss
of
his
sword
it
was
when
the
riders
of
muspell
came
against
asgard
and
the
vanir
who
might
have
prevailed
prevailed
not
because
of
the
loss
of
frey
sword
they
found
iduna
and
they
brought
her
back
but
still
care
and
foreboding
crept
through
asgard
and
it
was
known
too
that
the
witch
gulveig
was
changing
the
thoughts
of
the
gods
at
last
odin
had
to
judge
gulveig
he
judged
her
and
decreed
her
death
and
only
gungnir
the
spear
of
odin
might
slay
gulveig
who
was
not
of
mortal
race
odin
hurled
gungnir
the
spear
went
through
gulveig
but
still
she
stood
smiling
at
the
gods
a
second
time
odin
hurled
his
spear
a
second
time
gungnir
pierced
the
witch
she
stood
livid
as
one
dead
but
fell
not
down
a
third
time
odin
hurled
his
spear
and
now
pierced
for
the
third
time
the
witch
gave
a
scream
that
made
all
asgard
shudder
and
she
fell
in
death
on
the
ground
i
have
slain
in
these
halls
where
slaying
is
forbidden
odin
said
take
now
the
corpse
of
gulveig
and
burn
it
on
the
ramparts
so
that
no
trace
of
the
witch
who
has
troubled
us
will
remain
in
asgard
they
brought
the
corpse
of
gulveig
the
witch
out
on
the
ramparts
and
they
lighted
fires
under
the
pile
on
which
they
laid
her
and
they
called
upon
hræsvelgur
to
fan
up
the
flame
hræsvelgur
is
the
giant
who
on
heaven
edge
sits
in
the
guise
of
an
eagle
and
the
winds
it
is
said
rush
down
on
the
earth
from
his
outspreading
pinions
far
away
was
loki
when
all
this
was
being
done
often
now
he
went
from
asgard
and
his
journeys
were
to
look
upon
that
wondrous
treasure
that
had
passed
from
the
keeping
of
the
dwarf
andvari
it
was
gulveig
who
had
kept
the
imagination
of
that
treasure
within
his
mind
now
when
he
came
back
and
heard
the
whispers
of
what
had
been
done
a
rage
flamed
up
within
him
for
loki
was
one
of
those
whose
minds
were
being
changed
by
the
presence
and
the
whispers
of
the
witch
gulveig
his
mind
was
being
changed
to
hatred
of
the
gods
now
he
went
to
the
place
of
burning
all
her
body
was
in
ashes
but
her
heart
had
not
been
devoured
by
the
flames
and
loki
in
his
rage
took
the
heart
of
the
witch
and
ate
it
oh
black
and
direful
was
it
in
asgard
the
day
that
loki
ate
the
heart
that
the
flames
would
not
devour
illustration
loki
the
betrayer
he
stole
frigga
dress
of
falcon
feathers
then
as
a
falcon
he
flew
out
of
asgard
jötunheim
was
the
place
that
he
flew
toward
the
anger
and
the
fierceness
of
the
hawk
was
within
loki
as
he
flew
through
the
giants
realm
the
heights
and
the
chasms
of
that
dread
land
made
his
spirits
mount
up
like
fire
he
saw
the
whirlpools
and
the
smoking
mountains
and
had
joy
of
these
sights
higher
and
higher
he
soared
until
looking
toward
the
south
he
saw
the
flaming
land
of
muspelheim
higher
and
higher
still
he
soared
with
his
falcon
eyes
he
saw
the
gleam
of
surtur
flaming
sword
all
the
fire
of
muspelheim
and
all
the
gloom
of
jötunheim
would
one
day
be
brought
against
asgard
and
against
midgard
but
loki
was
no
longer
dismayed
to
think
of
the
ruin
of
asgard
beauty
and
the
ruin
of
midgard
promise
he
hovered
around
one
of
the
dwellings
in
jötunheim
why
had
he
come
to
it
because
he
had
seen
two
of
the
women
of
that
dwelling
and
his
rage
against
the
asyniur
and
the
vanir
was
such
that
the
ugliness
and
the
evil
of
these
women
was
pleasing
to
him
he
hovered
before
the
open
door
of
the
giant
house
and
he
looked
upon
those
who
were
within
gerriöd
the
most
savage
of
all
the
giants
was
there
and
beside
him
squatting
on
the
ground
were
his
two
evil
and
ugly
daughters
gialp
and
greip
they
were
big
and
bulky
black
and
rugged
with
horses
teeth
and
hair
that
was
like
horses
manes
gialp
was
the
uglier
of
the
two
if
one
could
be
said
to
be
uglier
than
the
other
for
her
nose
was
a
yard
long
and
her
eyes
were
crooked
what
were
they
talking
about
as
they
sat
there
one
scratching
the
other
of
asgard
and
the
dwellers
in
asgard
whom
they
hated
thor
was
the
one
whom
they
hated
most
of
all
and
they
were
speaking
of
all
they
would
like
to
do
to
him
i
would
keep
thor
bound
in
chains
said
gerriöd
the
giant
and
i
would
beat
him
to
death
with
my
iron
club
i
would
grind
his
bones
to
powder
said
greip
i
would
tear
the
flesh
off
his
bones
said
gialp
father
can
you
not
catch
this
thor
and
bring
him
to
us
alive
not
so
long
as
he
has
his
hammer
miölnir
and
the
gloves
with
which
he
grasps
his
hammer
and
the
belt
that
doubles
his
strength
oh
if
we
could
catch
him
without
his
hammer
and
his
belt
and
his
gloves
cried
gialp
and
greip
together
at
that
moment
they
saw
the
falcon
hovering
before
the
door
they
were
eager
now
for
something
to
hold
and
torment
and
so
the
hearts
of
the
three
became
set
upon
catching
the
falcon
they
did
not
stir
from
the
place
where
they
were
sitting
but
they
called
the
child
glapp
who
was
swinging
from
the
and
they
bade
him
go
out
and
try
to
catch
the
falcon
all
concealed
by
the
great
leaves
the
child
glapp
climbed
up
the
ivy
that
was
around
the
door
the
falcon
came
hovering
near
then
glapp
caught
it
by
the
wings
and
fell
down
through
the
ivy
screaming
and
struggling
as
he
was
being
beaten
and
clawed
and
torn
by
the
wings
and
the
talons
and
the
beak
of
the
falcon
gerriöd
and
greip
and
gialp
rushed
out
and
kept
hold
of
the
falcon
as
the
giant
held
him
in
his
hands
and
looked
him
over
he
knew
that
this
was
no
the
eyes
showed
him
to
be
of
alfheim
or
asgard
the
giant
took
him
and
shut
him
in
a
box
till
he
would
speak
soon
he
tapped
at
the
closed
box
and
when
gerriöd
opened
it
loki
spoke
to
him
so
glad
was
the
savage
giant
to
have
one
of
the
dwellers
in
asgard
in
his
power
that
he
and
his
daughters
did
nothing
but
laugh
and
chuckle
to
each
other
for
days
and
all
this
time
they
left
loki
in
the
closed
box
to
waste
with
hunger
when
they
opened
the
box
again
loki
spoke
to
them
he
told
them
he
would
do
any
injury
to
the
dwellers
in
asgard
that
would
please
them
if
they
would
let
him
go
will
you
bring
thor
to
us
said
greip
will
you
bring
thor
to
us
without
his
hammer
and
without
the
gloves
with
which
he
grasps
his
hammer
and
without
his
belt
said
gialp
i
will
bring
him
to
you
if
you
will
let
me
go
loki
said
thor

easily
deceived
and
i
can
bring
him
to
you
without
his
hammer
and
his
belt
and
his
gloves
we
will
let
you
go
loki
said
the
giant
if
you
will
swear
by
the
gloom
of
jötunheim
that
you
will
bring
thor
to
us
as
you
say
loki
swore
that
he
would
do
so
by
the
gloom
of
jötunheim
yea
and
by
the
fires
of
muspelheim
he
added
the
giant
and
his
daughters
let
him
go
and
he
flew
back
to
asgard
he
restored
to
frigga
her
falcon
dress
all
blamed
him
for
having
stolen
it
but
when
he
told
how
he
had
been
shut
up
without
food
in
dwelling
those
who
judged
him
thought
he
had
been
punished
enough
for
the
theft
he
spoke
as
before
to
the
dwellers
in
asgard
and
the
rage
and
hatred
he
had
against
them
since
he
had
eaten
gulveig
heart
he
kept
from
bursting
forth
he
talked
to
thor
of
the
adventures
they
had
together
in
jötunheim
thor
would
now
roar
with
laughter
when
he
talked
of
the
time
when
he
went
as
a
bride
to
thrym
the
giant
loki
was
able
to
persuade
him
to

said
thor

and
his

then
he
and
loki
went
toward
jötunheim
when
they
were
near
the
end
of
their
journey
they
came
to
a
wide
river
and
with
a
young
giant
whom
they
met
on
the
bank
they
began
to
ford
it
suddenly
the
river
began
to
rise
loki
and
the
young
giant
would
have
been
swept
away
only
thor
gripped
both
of
them
higher
and
higher
the
river
rose
and
rougher
and
rougher
it
became
thor
had
to
plant
his
feet
firmly
on
the
bottom
or
he
and
the
two
he
held
would
have
been
swept
down
by
the
flood
he
struggled
across
holding
loki
and
the
young
giant
a
mountain
ash
grew
out
of
the
bank
and
while
the
two
held
to
him
he
grasped
it
with
his
hands
the
river
rose
still
higher
but
thor
was
able
to
draw
loki
and
the
young
giant
to
the
bank
and
then
he
himself
scrambled
up
on
it
now
looking
up
the
river
he
saw
a
sight
that
filled
him
with
rage
a
giantess
was
pouring
a
flood
into
it
this
it
was
that
was
making
the
river
rise
and
seethe
thor
pulled
a
rock
out
of
the
bank
and
hurled
it
at
her
it
struck
her
and
flung
her
into
the
flood
then
she
struggled
out
of
the
water
and
went
yelping
away
this
giantess
was
gialp
gerriöd
ugly
and
evil
daughter
nothing
would
do
the
young
giant
whom
thor
had
helped
across
but
that
the
pair
would
go
and
visit
grid
his
mother
who
lived
in
a
cave
in
the
hillside
loki
would
not
go
and
was
angered
to
hear
that
thor
thought
of

but
thor
seeing
that
the
giant
youth
was
friendly

willing
enough
to
go

loki
he
watched

go
up
the
hillside
to
grid
cave
he
waited
until
he
saw
thor
come
back
down
the
hillside
and
go
toward
gerriöd
dwelling
he
watched
thor
go
into
the
house
where
as
he
thought
death
awaited
him
then
in
a
madness
for
what
he
had
done
loki
with
his
head
drawn
down
on
his
shoulders
started
running
like
a
bird
along
the
ground
grid
the
old
giantess
was
seated
on
the
floor
of
the
cave
grinding
corn
between
two
stones
who
is
it
she
said

put
the
worn
length
of

around
his
waist
and
as
he
did
he
knew
that
grid
the
old
giantess
was
indeed
the
mistress
of
magical
things
for
immediately
he
felt
his
strength
augmented
as
when
he
put
on
his
own
belt
of
strength
he
then
drew
on
the
mittens
and
took
the
staff
that
she
gave
him
in
his
hands
he
left
the
cave
of
grid
the
old
giantess
and
went
to
dwelling
loki
was
not
there
it
was
then
that
thor
began
to
think
that
perhaps
old
grid
was
right
and
that
a
trap
was
being
laid
for
him
no
one
was
in
the
hall
he
came
out
of
the
hall
and
into
a
great
stone
chamber
and
he
saw
no
one
there
either
but
in
the
center
of
the
stone
chamber
there
was
a
stone
seat
and
thor
went
to
it
and
seated
himself
upon
it
no
sooner
was
he
seated
than
the
chair
flew
upwards
thor
would
have
been
crushed
against
the
stone
roof
only
that
he
held
his
staff
up
so
great
was
the
power
in
the
staff
so
great
was
the
strength
that
the
string
around
him
gave
that
the
chair
was
thrust
downward
the
stone
chair
crashed
down
upon
the
stone
floor
there
were
horrible
screams
from
under
it
thor
lifted
up
the
seat
and
saw
two
ugly
broken
bodies
there
the
giant
daughters
gialp
and
greip
had
hidden
themselves
under
the
chair
to
watch
his
death
but
the
stone
that
was
to
have
crushed
him
against
the
ceiling
had
crushed
them
against
the
floor
thor
strode
out
of
that
chamber
with
his
teeth
set
hard
a
great
fire
was
blazing
in
the
hall
and
standing
beside
that
fire
he
saw
gerriöd
the
giant
he
held
a
tongs
into
the
fire
as
thor
came
toward
him
he
lifted
up
the
tongs
and
flung
from
it
a
blazing
wedge
of
iron
it
whizzed
straight
toward
thor
forehead
thor
put
up
his
hands
and
caught
the
blazing
wedge
of
iron
between
the
mittens
that
old
grid
had
given
him
quickly
he
hurled
it
back
at
gerriöd
it
struck
the
giant
on
the
forehead
and
went
blazing
through
him
gerriöd
crashed
down
into
the
fire
and
the
burning
iron
made
a
blaze
all
around
him
and
when
thor
reached
grid
cave
he
went
there
to
restore
to
the
old
giantess
the
string
the
mittens
and
the
staff
of
power
she
had
given
him
he
saw
the
giant
dwelling
in
such
a
blaze
that
one
would
think
the
fires
of
muspelheim
were
all
around
it

been
wifely
with
your
husband
instead
of
breaking
faith
with
him
for
the
sake
of
a
necklace
that
you
craved
of
the
giant
women
amazement
fell
on
all
at
the
bitterness
that
was
in
loki
words
and
looks
tyr
and
niörd
stood
up
from
their
seats
but
then
the
voice
of
odin
was
heard
and
all
was
still
for
the
words
of
the
take
the
place
beside
vidar
my
silent
son
o
loki
said
odin
and
let
thy
tongue
which
drips
bitterness
be
silent
all
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
listen
to
thy
words
o
odin
as
if
thou
wert
always
wise
and
just
loki
said
but
must
we
forget
that
thou
didst
bring
war
into
the
world
when
thou
didst
fling
thy
spear
at
the
envoys
of
the
vanir
and
didst
thou
not
permit
me
to
work
craftily
on
the
one
who
built
the
wall
around
asgard
for
a
price
thou
dost
speak
o
odin
and
all
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
listen
to
thee
but
was
it
not
thou
who
thinking
not
of
wisdom
but
of
gold
when
a
ransom
had
to
be
made
brought
the
witch
gulveig
out
of
the
cave
where
she
stayed
with
the
treasure
thou
wert
not
always
wise
nor
always
just
o
odin
and
we
at
the
table
here
need
not
listen
to
thee
as
if
always
thou
wert
then
skadi
the
wife
of
niörd
flung
words
at
loki
she
spoke
with
all
the
fierceness
of
her
giant
blood
why
should
we
not
rise
up
and
chase
from
the
hall
this
chattering
crow
she
said
skadi
said
loki
remember
that
the
ransom
for
thy
father
death
has
not
yet
been
paid
thou
wert
glad
to
snatch
a
husband
instead
of
it
remember
who
it
was
that
killed
thy
giant
father
it
was
i
loki
and
no
ransom
have
i
paid
thee
for
it
although
thou
hast
come
amongst
us
in
asgard
then
loki
fixed
his
eyes
on
frey
the
giver
of
the
feast
and
all
knew
that
with
bitter
words
he
was
about
to
assail
him
but
tyr
the
brave
swordsman
rose
up
and
said
not
against
frey
mayst
thou
speak
o
loki
frey

generous
he
is
the
one
amongst
us
who
spares
the
vanquished
and
frees
the
captive

speaking
tyr
said
loki
thou
mayst
not
always
have
a
hand
to
hold
that
sword
of
thine
remember
this
saying
of
mine
in
days
to
come
frey
said
he
because
thou
art
the
giver
of
the
feast
they
think
i
will
not
speak
the
truth
about
thee
but
i
am
not
to
be
bribed
by
a
feast
didst
thou
not
send
skirnir
to
gymer
dwelling
to
befool
flighty
daughter
didst
thou
not
bribe
him
into
frightening
her
into
a
marriage
with
thee
who
men
say
wert
the
slayer
of
her
brother
yea
frey
thou
didst
part
with
a
charge
with
the
magic
sword
that
thou
shouldst
have
kept
for
the
battle
thou
hadst
cause
to
grieve
when
thou
didst
meet
beli
by
the
lake
when
he
said
this
all
who
were
there
of
the
vanir
rose
up
their
faces
threatening
loki

ye

loki
railed
if
the

the

of

upon

it
was
your
part
to
be
the
first
or
the
last
on

but
already
ye
have
lost
the
battle
for

for

weapon
that

put
into

he
bartered
for

the
giantess
ha
surtur
shall
triumph
over

because
of

in
horror
they
looked
at
the
one
who
could
let
his
hatred
speak
of
surtur
triumph
all
would
have
laid
hands
on
loki
only
odin
voice
rang
out
then
another
appeared
at
the
entrance
of
the
feasting
hall
it
was
thor
with
his
hammer
upon
his
shoulder
his
gloves
of
iron
on
his
hands
and
his
belt
of
prowess
around
him
he
stood
marking
loki
with
wrathful
eyes
ha
loki
betrayer
he
shouted
thou
didst
plan
to
leave

dead
in

house
but
now
thou
wilt
meet
death
by
the
stroke
of
this
hammer
his
hands
were
raised
to

but
the
words
that
odin
spoke
were
heard
not
in
this
hall
may
slaying
be
done
son
thor
keep
thy
hands
upon
thy
hammer
then
shrinking
from
the
wrath
in
the
eyes
of
thor
loki
passed
out
of
the
feast
hall
he
went
beyond
the
walls
of
asgard
and
crossed
bifröst
the
rainbow
bridge
and
he
cursed
bifröst
and
longed
to
see
the
day
when
the
armies
of
muspelheim
would
break
it
down
in
their
rush
against
asgard
east
of
midgard
there
was
a
place
more
evil
than
any
region
in
jötunheim
it
was
jarnvid
the
iron
wood
there
dwelt
witches
who
were
the
most
foul
of
all
witches
and
they
had
a
queen
over
them
a
hag
mother
of
many
sons
who
took
upon
themselves
the
shapes
of
wolves
two
of
her
sons
were
skoll
and
hati
who
pursued
sol
the
sun
and
mani
the
moon
she
had
a
third
son
who
was
managarm
the
wolf
who
was
to
be
filled
with
the
of
men
who
was
to
swallow
up
the
moon
and
stain
the
heavens
and
earth
with
blood
to
jarnvid
the
iron
wood
loki
made
his
way
and
he
wed
one
of
the
witches
there
angerboda
and
they
had
children
that
took
on
dread
shapes
loki
offspring
were
the
most
terrible
of
the
foes
that
were
to
come
against
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
in
the
time
that
was
called
the
twilight
of
the
gods
illustration
the
valkyrie
against
the
time
when
the
riders
of
muspelheim
with
the
giants
and
the
evil
powers
of
the
underworld
would
bring
on
battle
odin
was
preparing
a
host
of
defenders
for
asgard
they
were
not
of
the
æsir
nor
of
the
vanir
they
were
of
the
race
of
mortal
men
heroes
chosen
from
amongst
the
slain
on
fields
of
battle
in
midgard
to
choose
the
heroes
and
to
give
victory
to
those
whom
he
willed
to
have
victory
odin
had
that
went
to
the
fields
of
war
beautiful
were
those
and
fearless
wise
were
they
also
for
to
them
odin
showed
the
runes
of
wisdom
valkyries
choosers
of
the
slain
they
were
named
those
who
were
chosen
on
the
fields
of
the
slain
were
called
in
asgard
the
einherjar
for
them
odin
made
ready
a
great
hall
valhalla
the
hall
of
the
slain
it
was
called
five
hundred
and
forty
doors
had
valhalla
and
out
of
each
door
eight
hundred
champions
might
pass
every
day
the
champions
put
on
their
armor
and
took
their
weapons
down
from
the
walls
and
went
forth
and
battled
with
each
other
all
who
were
wounded
were
made
whole
again
and
in
peace
and
goodly
fellowship
they
sat
down
to
the
feast
that
odin
prepared
for
them
odin
himself
sat
with
his
champions
drinking
wine
but
eating
no
meat
for
meat
the
champions
ate
the
flesh
of
the
boar
sæhrimnir
every
day
the
boar
was
killed
and
cooked
and
every
morning
it
was
whole
again
for
drink
they
had
the
mead
that
was
made
from
the
milk
of
the
goat
heidrun
the
goat
that
browsed
on
the
leaves
of
the
tree
læradir
and
the
valkyries
the
wise
and
fearless
went
amongst
them
filling
up
the
with
the
heady
mead
youngest
of
all
the
was
brynhild
nevertheless
to
her
odin
had
shown
more
of
the
runes
of
wisdom
than
he
had
shown
to
any
of
her
sisters
and
when
the
time
came
for
brynhild
to
journey
down
into
midgard
he
gave
her
a
dress
such
as
he
had
given
before
to
the
three
valkyrie
sisters
alvit
olrun
and
hladgrun
in
the
dazzling
plumage
of
a
swan
the
young
flew
down
from
asgard
not
yet
had
she
to
go
to
the
battlefields
waters
drew
her
and
as
she
waited
on
the
will
of
the
she
sought
out
a
lake
that
had
golden
sands
for
its
shore
and
as
a
maiden
bathed
in
it
now
there
dwelt
near
this
lake
a
young
hero
whose
name
was
agnar
and
one
day
as
agnar
lay
by
the
lake
he
saw
a
swan
with
dazzling
plumage
fly
down
to
it
and
while
she
was
in
the
reeds
the
dress
slipped
off
her
and
agnar
beheld
the
swan
change
to
a
maiden
so
bright
was
her
hair
so
strong
and
swift
were
all
her
movements
that
he
knew
her
for
one
of
odin
for
one
of
those
who
give
victory
and
choose
the
slain
very
daring
was
agnar
and
he
set
his
mind
upon
capturing
this
even
though
he
should
bring
on
himself
the
wrath
of
odin
by
doing
it
he
hid
the
dress
that
she
had
left
in
the
reeds
when
she
came
out
of
the
water
she
might
not
fly
away
agnar
gave
back
to
her
the
dress
but
she
had
to
promise
that
she
would
be
his
and
as
they
talked
together
the
young
valkyrie
saw
in
him
a
hero
that
one
from
asgard
might
help
very
brave
and
very
noble
was
agnar
brynhild
went
with
him
as
his
and
she
told
him
much
from
the
runes
of
wisdom
that
she
knew
and
she
showed
him
that
the
last
hope
was
in
the
bravery
of
the
heroes
of
the
earth
with
the
chosen
from
the
slain
for
his
champions
he
would
make
battle
in
defence
of
asgard
always
brynhild
was
with
agnar
battalions
above
the
battles
she
hovered
her
bright
hair
and
flashing
outshining
the
spears
and
swords
and
shields
of
the
warriors
but
the
king
helmgunnar
made
war
on
the
young
agnar
odin
favored
the
king
and
to
him
he
promised
the
victory
brynhild
knew
the
will
of
the
but
to
agnar
not
to
helmgunnar
she
gave
the
victory
doomed
was
brynhild
on
the
instant
she
went
against
odin
will
never
again
might
she
come
into
asgard
a
mortal
woman
she
was
now
and
the
norns
began
to
spin
the
thread
of
her
mortal
destiny
sorrowful
was
odin
that
the
wisest
of
his
might
never
appear
in
asgard
nor
walk
by
the
benches
at
the
feasts
of
his
champions
in
valhalla
he
rode
down
on
sleipner
to
where
brynhild
was
and
when
he
came
before
her
it
was
his
and
not
her
head
that
was
bowed
down
for
she
knew
now
that
the
world
of
men
was
paying
a
bitter
price
for
the
strength
that
asgard
would
have
in
the
last
battle
the
bravest
and
noblest
were
being
taken
from
midgard
to
fill
up
the
ranks
of
champions
and
brynhild
heart
was
full
of
anger
against
the
rulers
of
asgard
and
she
cared
no
more
to
be
of
them
odin
looked
on
his
unflinching
and
he
said
is
there
aught
thou
wouldst
have
me
bestow
on
thee
in
thy
mortal
life
brynhild
naught
save
this
brynhild
answered
that
in
my
mortal
life
no
one
but
a
man
without
fear
the
bravest
hero
in
the
world
may
claim
me
for
wife
bowed
his
head
in
thought
it
shall
be
as
thou
hast
asked
he
said
only
he
who
is
without
fear
shall
come
near
thee
then
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
that
is
called
hindfell
he
had
a
hall
built
that
faced
the
south
ten
dwarfs
built
it
of
black
stone
and
when
the
hall
was
built
he
put
round
it
a
wall
of
mounting
and
circling
fire
more
did
odin
he
took
a
thorn
of
the
tree
of
sleep
and
he
put
it
into
the
flesh
of
the
then
with
her
helmet
on
her
head
and
the
of
the
valkyrie
upon
her
he
lifted
brynhild
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
through
the
wall
of
mounting
and
circling
fire
he
laid
her
upon
the
couch
that
was
within
the
hall
there
she
would
lie
in
slumber
until
the
hero
who
was
without
fear
should
ride
through
the
flame
and
waken
her
to
the
life
of
a
mortal
woman
he
took
farewell
of
her
and
he
rode
back
to
asgard
on
sleipner
he
might
not
foresee
what
fate
would
be
hers
as
a
mortal
woman
but
the
fire
he
had
left
went
mounting
and
circling
around
the
hall
that
the
dwarfs
had
built
for
ages
that
fire
would
be
a
fence
around
where
brynhild
once
a
valkyrie
lay
in
sleep
illustration
the
children
of
loki
the
children
of
loki
and
the
witch
angerboda
were
not
as
the
children
of
men
they
were
formless
as
water
or
air
or
fire
is
formless
but
it
was
given
to
each
of
them
to
take
on
the
form
that
was
most
like
to
their
own
greed
now
the
dwellers
in
asgard
knew
that
these
powers
of
evil
had
been
born
into
the
world
and
they
thought
it
well
that
they
should
take
on
forms
and
appear
before
them
in
asgard
so
they
sent
one
to
jarnvid
the
iron
wood
bidding
loki
bring
before
the
gods
the
powers
born
of
him
and
the
witch
angerboda
so
loki
came
into
asgard
once
more
and
his
offspring
took
on
forms
and
showed
themselves
to
the
gods
the
first
whose
greed
was
destruction
showed
himself
as
a
fearful
wolf
fenrir
he
was
named
and
the
second
whose
greed
was
slow
destruction
showed
itself
as
a
serpent
jörmungand
it
was
called
the
third
whose
greed
was
for
withering
of
all
life
took
on
a
form
also
when
the
gods
saw
it
they
were
affrighted
for
this
had
the
form
of
a
woman
and
one
side
of
her
was
that
of
a
living
woman
and
the
other
side
of
her
was
that
of
a
corpse
fear
ran
through
asgard
as
this
form
was
revealed
and
as
the
name
that
went
with
it
hela
was
uttered
far
out
of
sight
of
the
gods
hela
was
thrust
odin
took
her
and
hurled
her
down
to
the
deeps
that
are
below
the
world
he
cast
her
down
to
niflheim
where
she
took
to
herself
power
over
the
nine
regions
there
in
the
place
that
is
lowest
of
all
hela
reigns
her
hall
is
elvidnir
it
is
set
round
with
high
walls
and
it
has
barred
gates
precipice
is
the
threshold
of
that
hall
hunger
is
the
table
within
it
care
is
the
bed
and
burning
anguish
is
the
hanging
of
the
chamber
thor
laid
hold
upon
jörmungand
he
flung
the
serpent
into
the
ocean
that
engirdles
the
world
but
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
jörmungand
flourished
it
grew
and
grew
until
it
encircled
the
whole
world
and
men
knew
it
as
the
midgard
serpent
fenrir
the
wolf
might
not
be
seized
upon
by
any
of
the
æsir
fearfully
he
ranged
through
asgard
and
they
were
only
able
to
bring
him
to
the
outer
courts
by
promising
to
give
him
all
the
food
he
was
able
to
eat
the
æsir
shrank
from
feeding
fenrir
but
tyr
the
brave
swordsman
was
willing
to
bring
food
to
the
wolf
lair
every
day
he
brought
him
huge
provision
and
fed
him
with
the
point
of
his
sword
the
wolf
grew
and
grew
until
he
became
monstrous
and
a
terror
in
the
minds
of
the
dwellers
in
asgard
at
last
the
gods
in
council
considered
it
and
decided
that
fenrir
must
be
bound
the
chain
that
they
would
bind
him
with
was
called
laeding
in
their
own
smithy
the
gods
made
it
and
its
weight
was
greater
than
hammer
not
by
force
could
the
gods
get
the
fetter
upon
fenrir
so
they
sent
skirnir
the
servant
of
frey
to
beguile
the
wolf
into
letting
it
go
upon
him
skirnir
came
to
his
lair
and
stood
near
him
and
he
was
dwarfed
by
the
wolf
monstrous
size
how
great
may
thy
strength
be
mighty
one
skirnir
asked
couldst
thou
break
this
chain
easily
the
gods
would
try
thee
in
scorn
fenrir
looked
down
on
the
fetter
skirnir
dragged
in
scorn
he
stood
still
allowing
laeding
to
be
placed
upon
him
then
with
an
effort
that
was
the
least
part
of
his
strength
he
stretched
himself
and
broke
the
chain
in
two
the
gods
were
dismayed
but
they
took
more
iron
and
with
greater
fires
and
mightier
hammer
blows
they
forged
another
fetter
dromi
this
one
was
called
and
it
was
half
again
as
strong
as
laeding
was
skirnir
the
venturesome
brought
it
to
the
wolf
lair
and
in
scorn
fenrir
let
the
mightier
chain
be
placed
upon
him
he
shook
himself
and
the
chain
held
then
his
eyes
became
fiery
and
he
stretched
himself
with
a
growl
and
a
snarl
dromi
broke
across
and
fenrir
stood
looking
balefully
at
skirnir
the
gods
saw
that
no
chain
they
could
forge
would
bind
fenrir
and
they
fell
more
and
more
into
fear
of
him
they
took
council
again
and
they
bethought
them
of
the
the
dwarfs
had
made
for
them
the
spear
gungnir
the
ship
skidbladnir
the
hammer
miölnir
could
the
dwarfs
be
got
to
make
the
fetter
to
bind
fenrir
if
they
would
do
it
the
gods
would
add
to
their
domain
skirnir
went
down
to
svartheim
with
the
message
from
asgard
the
dwarf
chief
swelled
with
pride
to
think
that
it
was
left
to
them
to
make
the
fetter
that
would
bind
fenrir
we
dwarfs
can
make
a
fetter
that
will
bind
the
wolf
he
said
out
of
six
things
we
will
make
it
what
are
these
six
things
skirnir
asked
the
roots
of
stones
the
breath
of
a
fish
the
beards
of
women
the
noise
made
by
the
footfalls
of
cats
the
sinews
of
bears
the
spittle
of
a
bird
i
have
never
heard
the
noise
made
by
a
cat
footfall
nor
have
i
seen
the
roots
of
stones
nor
the
beards
of
women
but
use
what
things
you
will
o
helper
of
the
gods
the
chief
brought
his
six
things
together
and
the
dwarfs
in
their
smithy
worked
for
days
and
nights
they
forged
a
fetter
that
was
named
gleipnir
smooth
and
soft
as
a
silken
string
it
was
skirnir
brought
it
to
asgard
and
put
it
into
the
hands
of
the
gods
then
a
day
came
when
the
gods
said
that
once
again
they
should
try
to
put
a
fetter
upon
fenrir
but
if
he
was
to
be
bound
they
would
bind
him
far
from
asgard
lyngvi
was
an
island
that
they
often
went
to
to
make
sport
and
they
spoke
of
going
there
fenrir
growled
that
he
would
go
with
them
he
came
and
he
sported
in
his
own
terrible
way
and
then
as
if
it
were
to
make
more
sport
one
of
the
æsir
shook
out
the
smooth
cord
and
showed
it
to
fenrir
it
is
stronger
than
you
might
think
mighty
one
they
said
will
you
not
let
it
go
upon
you
that
we
may
see
you
break
it
fenrir
out
of
his
fiery
eyes
looked
scorn
upon
them
what
fame
would
there
be
for
me
he
said
in
breaking
such
a
binding
they
showed
him
that
none
in
their
company
could
break
it
slender
as
it
was
thou
only
art
able
to
break
it
mighty
one
they
said
the
cord
is
slender
but
there
may
be
an
enchantment
in
it
fenrir
said
thou
canst
not
break
it
fenrir
and
we
need
not
dread
thee
any
more
the
gods
said
then
was
the
wolf
ravenous
wroth
for
he
lived
on
the
fear
that
he
made
in
the
minds
of
the
gods
i
am
loth
to
have
this
binding
upon
me
he
said
but
if
one
of
the
æsir
will
put
his
hand
in
my
mouth
as
a
pledge
that
i
shall
be
freed
of
it
i
will
let
ye
put
it
on
me
the
gods
looked
wistfully
on
one
another
it
would
be
health
to
them
all
to
have
fenrir
bound
but
who
would
lose
his
hand
to
have
it
done
one
and
then
another
of
the
æsir
stepped
backward
but
not
tyr
the
brave
swordsman
he
stepped
to
fenrir
and
laid
his
left
hand
before
those
tremendous
jaws
not
thy
left
hand
thy
swordhand
o
tyr
growled
fenrir
and
tyr
put
his
swordhand
into
that
terrible
mouth
then
the
cord
gleipnir
was
put
upon
fenrir
with
fiery
eyes
he
watched
the
gods
bind
him
when
the
binding
was
on
him
he
stretched
himself
as
before
he
stretched
himself
to
a
monstrous
size
but
the
binding
did
not
break
off
him
then
with
fury
he
snapped
his
jaws
upon
the
hand
and
tyr
hand
the
swordsman
hand
was
torn
off
but
fenrir
was
bound
they
fixed
a
mighty
chain
to
the
fetter
and
they
passed
the
chain
through
a
hole
they
bored
through
a
great
rock
the
monstrous
wolf
made
terrible
efforts
to
break
loose
but
the
rock
and
the
chain
and
the
fetter
held
then
seeing
him
secured
and
to
avenge
the
loss
of
tyr
hand
the
gods
took
tyr
sword
and
drove
it
to
the
hilt
through
his
underjaw
horribly
the
wolf
howled
mightily
the
foam
flowed
down
from
his
jaws
that
foam
flowing
made
a
river
that
is
called
von
a
river
of
fury
that
flowed
on
until
ragnarök
came
the
twilight
of
the
gods
illustration
baldur
doom
in
asgard
there
were
two
places
that
meant
strength
and
joy
to
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
one
was
the
garden
where
grew
the
apples
that
iduna
gathered
and
the
other
was
the
peace
stead
where
in
a
palace
called
breidablik
baldur
the
dwelt
in
the
peace
stead
no
crime
had
ever
been
committed
no
blood
had
ever
been
shed
no
falseness
had
ever
been
spoken
contentment
came
into
the
minds
of
all
in
asgard
when
they
thought
upon
this
place
ah
were
it
not
that
the
peace
stead
was
there
happy
with
baldur
presence
the
minds
of
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
might
have
become
gloomy
and
stern
from
thinking
on
the
direful
things
that
were
arrayed
against
them
baldur
was
beautiful
so
beautiful
was
he
that
all
the
white
blossoms
on
the
earth
were
called
by
his
name
baldur
was
happy
so
happy
was
he
that
all
the
birds
on
the
earth
sang
his
name
so
just
and
so
wise
was
baldur
that
the
judgment
he
pronounced
might
never
be
altered
nothing
foul
or
unclean
had
ever
come
near
where
he
had
his
dwelling
is
breidablik
called
where
baldur
the
fair
hath
built
him
a
bower
in
the
land
where
i
know
least
loathliness
lies
healing
things
were
done
in
baldur
stead
tyr
wrist
was
healed
of
the
wounds
that
fenrir
fangs
had
made
and
there
frey
mind
became
less
troubled
with
the
foreboding
that
loki
had
filled
it
with
when
he
railed
at
him
about
the
bartering
of
his
sword
now
after
fenrir
had
been
bound
to
the
rock
in
the
faraway
island
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
knew
a
while
of
contentment
they
passed
bright
days
in
baldur
stead
listening
to
the
birds
that
made
music
there
and
it
was
there
that
bragi
the
poet
wove
into
his
story
the
tale
of
thor
adventures
amongst
the
giants
but
even
into
baldur
stead
foreboding
came
one
day
little
hnossa
the
child
of
freya
and
the
lost
odur
was
brought
there
in
such
sorrow
that
no
one
outside
could
comfort
her
nanna
baldur
gentle
wife
took
the
child
upon
her
lap
and
found
ways
of
soothing
her
then
hnossa
told
of
a
dream
that
had
filled
her
with
fright
she
had
dreamt
of
hela
the
queen
that
is
half
living
woman
and
half
corpse
in
her
dream
hela
had
come
into
asgard
saying
a
lord
of
the
æsir
i
must
have
to
dwell
with
me
in
my
realm
beneath
the
earth
hnossa
had
such
fear
from
this
dream
that
she
had
fallen
into
a
deep
sorrow
a
silence
fell
upon
all
when
the
dream
of
hnossa
was
told
nanna
looked
wistfully
at
odin
and
odin
looking
at
frigga
saw
that
a
fear
had
entered
her
breast
he
left
the
peace
stead
and
went
to
his
watchtower
hlidskjalf
he
waited
there
till
hugin
and
munin
should
come
to
him
every
day
his
two
ravens
flew
through
the
world
and
coming
back
to
him
told
him
of
all
that
was
happening
and
now
they
might
tell
him
of
happenings
that
would
let
him
guess
if
hela
had
indeed
turned
her
thoughts
toward
asgard
or
if
she
had
the
power
to
draw
one
down
to
her
dismal
abode
the
ravens
flew
to
him
and
lighting
one
on
each
of
his
shoulders
told
him
of
things
that
were
being
said
up
and
down
ygdrassil
the
world
tree
ratatösk
the
squirrel
was
saying
them
and
ratatösk
had
heard
them
from
the
brood
of
serpents
that
with
nidhögg
the
great
dragon
gnawed
ever
at
the
root
of
ygdrassil
he
told
it
to
the
eagle
that
sat
ever
on
the
topmost
bough
that
in
hela
habitation
a
bed
was
spread
and
a
chair
was
left
empty
for
some
lordly
comer
and
hearing
this
odin
thought
that
it
were
better
that
fenrir
the
wolf
should
range
ravenously
through
asgard
than
that
hela
should
win
one
from
amongst
them
to
fill
that
chair
and
lie
in
that
bed
he
mounted
sleipner
his
steed
and
rode
down
toward
the
abodes
of
the
dead
for
three
days
and
three
nights
of
silence
and
darkness
he
journeyed
on
once
one
of
the
hounds
of
helheim
broke
loose
and
bayed
upon
sleipner
tracks
for
a
day
and
a
night
garm
the
hound
pursued
them
and
odin
smelled
the
blood
that
dripped
from
his
monstrous
jaws
at
last
he
came
to
where
wrapped
in
their
shrouds
a
field
of
the
dead
lay
he
dismounted
from
sleipner
and
called
upon
one
to
rise
and
speak
with
him
it
was
on
volva
a
dead
prophetess
he
called
and
when
he
pronounced
her
name
he
uttered
a
rune
that
had
the
power
to
break
the
sleep
of
the
dead
there
was
a
groaning
in
the
middle
of
where
the
shrouded
ones
lay
then
odin
cried
out
arise
volva
prophetess
there
was
a
stir
in
the
middle
of
where
the
shrouded
ones
lay
and
a
head
and
shoulders
were
thrust
up
from
amongst
the
dead
who
calls
on
volva
the
prophetess
the
rains
have
drenched
my
flesh
and
the
storms
have
shaken
my
bones
for
more
seasons
than
the
living
know
no
living
voice
has
a
right
to
call
me
from
my
sleep
with
the
dead
it
is
vegtam
the
wanderer
who
calls
for
whom
is
the
bed
prepared
and
the
seat
left
empty
in
hela
habitation
for
baldur
odin
son
is
the
bed
prepared
and
the
seat
left
empty
now
let
me
go
back
to
my
sleep
with
the
dead
but
now
odin
saw
beyond
volva
prophecy
who
is
it
he
cried
out
that
stands
with
unbowed
head
and
that
will
not
lament
for
baldur
answer
volva
prophetess
thou
seest
far
but
thou
canst
not
see
clearly
thou
art
odin
i
can
see
clearly
but
i
can
not
see
far
now
let
me
go
back
to
my
sleep
with
the
dead
volva
prophetess
odin
cried
out
again
but
the
voice
from
amongst
the
shrouded
ones
said
thou
canst
not
wake
me
any
more
until
the
fires
of
muspelheim
blaze
above
my
head
then
there
was
silence
in
the
field
of
the
dead
and
odin
turned
sleipner
his
steed
and
for
four
days
through
the
gloom
and
silence
he
journeyed
back
to
asgard
frigga
had
felt
the
fear
that
odin
had
felt
she
looked
toward
baldur
and
the
shade
of
hela
came
between
her
and
her
son
but
then
she
heard
the
birds
sing
in
the
peace
stead
and
she
knew
that
none
of
all
the
things
in
the
world
would
injure
baldur
and
to
make
it
sure
she
went
to
all
the
things
that
could
hurt
him
and
from
each
of
them
she
took
an
oath
that
it
would
not
injure
baldur
the
she
took
an
oath
from
fire
and
from
water
from
iron
and
from
all
metals
from
earths
and
stones
and
great
trees
from
birds
and
beasts
and
creeping
things
from
poisons
and
diseases
very
readily
they
all
gave
the
oath
that
they
would
work
no
injury
on
baldur
then
when
frigga
went
back
and
told
what
she
had
accomplished
the
gloom
that
had
lain
on
asgard
lifted
baldur
would
be
spared
to
them
hela
might
have
a
place
prepared
in
her
dark
habitation
but
neither
fire
nor
water
nor
iron
nor
any
metals
nor
earths
nor
stones
nor
great
woods
nor
birds
nor
beasts
nor
creeping
things
nor
poisons
nor
diseases
would
help
her
to
bring
him
down
hela
has
no
arms
to
draw
you
to
her
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
cried
to
baldur
hope
was
renewed
for
them
and
they
made
games
to
honor
baldur
they
had
him
stand
in
the
peace
stead
and
they
brought
against
him
all
the
things
that
had
sworn
to
leave
him
hurtless
and
neither
the
flung
full
at
him
nor
the
stone
out
of
the
sling
nor
the
burning
brand
nor
the
deluge
of
water
would
injure
the
beloved
of
asgard
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
laughed
joyously
to
see
these
things
fall
harmlessly
from
him
while
a
throng
came
to
join
them
in
the
games
dwarfs
and
friendly
giants
but
loki
the
hater
came
in
with
that
throng
he
watched
the
games
from
afar
he
saw
the
missiles
and
the
weapons
being
flung
and
he
saw
baldur
stand
smiling
and
happy
under
the
strokes
of
metal
and
stones
and
great
woods
he
wondered
at
the
sight
but
he
knew
that
he
might
not
ask
the
meaning
of
it
from
the
ones
who
knew
him
he
changed
his
shape
into
that
of
an
old
woman
and
he
went
amongst
those
who
were
making
sport
for
baldur
he
spoke
to
dwarfs
and
friendly
giants
go
to
frigga
and
ask
go
to
frigga
and
ask
was
all
the
answer
loki
got
from
any
of
them
then
to
fensalir
frigga
mansion
loki
went
he
told
those
in
the
mansion
that
he
was
groa
the
old
enchantress
who
was
drawing
out
of
thor
head
the
fragments
of
a
grindstone
that
a
giant
throw
had
embedded
in
it
frigga
knew
about
groa
and
she
praised
the
enchantress
for
what
she
had
done
many
fragments
of
the
great
grindstone
have
i
taken
out
of
thor
head
by
the
charms
i
know
said
the
pretended
groa
thor
was
so
grateful
that
he
brought
back
to
me
the
husband
that
he
once
had
carried
off
to
the
end
of
the
earth
so
overjoyed
was
i
to
find
my
husband
restored
that
i
forgot
the
rest
of
the
charms
and
i
left
some
fragments
of
the
stone
in
thor
head
so
loki
said
repeating
a
story
that
was
true
now
i
remember
the
rest
of
the
charm
he
said
and
i
can
draw
out
the
fragments
of
the
stone
that
are
left
but
will
you
not
tell
me
o
queen
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
extraordinary
things
i
saw
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
doing
i
will
tell
you
said
frigga
looking
kindly
and
happily
at
the
pretended
old
woman
they
are
hurling
all
manner
of
heavy
and
dangerous
things
at
baldur
my
beloved
son
and
all
asgard
cheers
to
see
that
neither
metal
nor
stone
nor
great
wood
will
hurt
him
but
why
will
they
not
hurt
him
said
the
pretended
enchantress
because
i
have
drawn
an
oath
from
all
dangerous
and
threatening
things
to
leave
baldur
hurtless
said
frigga
from
all
things
lady
is
there
no
thing
in
all
the
world
that
has
not
taken
an
oath
to
leave
baldur
hurtless
well
indeed
there
is
one
thing
that
has
not
taken
the
oath
but
that
thing
is
so
small
and
weak
that
i
passed
it
by
without
taking
thought
of
it
what
can
it
be
lady
the
mistletoe
that
is
without
root
or
strength
it
grows
on
the
eastern
side
of
valhalla
i
passed
it
by
without
drawing
an
oath
from
it
surely
you
were
not
wrong
to
pass
it
by
what
could
the
mistletoe
the
rootless
mistletoe
do
against
baldur
saying
this
the
pretended
enchantress
hobbled
off
but
not
far
did
the
pretender
go
hobbling
he
changed
his
gait
and
hurried
to
the
eastern
side
of
valhalla
there
a
great
oak
tree
flourished
and
out
of
a
branch
of
it
a
little
bush
of
mistletoe
grew
loki
broke
off
a
spray
and
with
it
in
his
hand
he
went
to
where
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
were
still
playing
games
to
honor
baldur
all
were
laughing
as
loki
drew
near
for
the
giants
and
the
dwarfs
the
asyniur
and
the
vana
were
all
casting
missiles
the
giants
threw
too
far
and
the
dwarfs
could
not
throw
far
enough
while
the
asyniur
and
the
vana
threw
far
and
wide
of
the
mark
in
the
midst
of
all
that
glee
and
gamesomeness
it
was
strange
to
see
one
standing
joyless
but
one
stood
so
and
he
was
of
the
æsir
hödur
baldur
blind
brother
why
do
you
not
enter
the
game
said
loki
to
him
in
his
changed
voice
i
have
no
missile
to
throw
at
baldur
hödur
said
take
this
and
throw
it
said
loki
it
is
a
twig
of
the
mistletoe
i
can
not
see
to
throw
it
said
hödur
i
will
guide
your
hand
said
loki
he
put
the
twig
of
mistletoe
in
hödur
hand
and
he
guided
the
hand
for
the
throw
the
twig
flew
toward
baldur
it
struck
him
on
the
breast
and
it
pierced
him
then
baldur
fell
down
with
a
deep
groan
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
the
dwarfs
and
the
friendly
giants
stood
still
in
doubt
and
fear
and
amazement
loki
slipped
away
and
blind
hödur
from
whose
hand
the
twig
of
mistletoe
had
gone
stood
quiet
not
knowing
that
his
throw
had
bereft
baldur
of
life
then
a
wailing
rose
around
the
peace
stead
it
was
from
the
asyniur
and
the
vana
baldur
was
dead
and
they
began
to
lament
him
and
while
they
were
lamenting
him
the
beloved

asgard
odin
came
amongst
them

when

said
modgudur
joyously
hermod
turned
sleipner
and
rode
back
through
the
rugged
glens
each
one
less
gloomy
than
the
other
he
reached
the
upper
world
and
saw
that
all
things
were
still
lamenting
for
baldur
joyously
hermod
rode
onward
he
met
the
vanir
in
the
middle
of
the
world
and
he
told
them
the
happy
tidings
then
hermod
and
the
vanir
went
through
the
world
seeking
out
each
thing
and
finding
that
each
thing
still
wept
for
baldur
but
one
day
hermod
came
upon
a
crow
that
was
sitting
on
the
dead
branch
of
a
tree
the
crow
made
no
lament
as
he
came
near
she
rose
up
and
flew
away
and
hermod
followed
her
to
make
sure
that
she
lamented
for
baldur
he
lost
sight
of
her
near
a
cave
and
then
before
the
cave
he
saw
a
hag
with
blackened
teeth
who
raised
no
voice
of
lament
if
thou
art
the
crow
that
came
flying
here
make
lament
for
baldur
hermod
said
i
thaukt
will
make
no
lament
for
baldur
the
hag
said
let
hela
keep
what
she
holds
all
things
weep
tears
for
baldur
hermod
said
i
will
weep
dry
tears
for
him
said
the
hag
she
hobbled
into
her
cave
and
as
hermod
followed
a
crow
fluttered
out
he
knew
that
this
was
thaukt
the
evil
hag
transformed
he
followed
her
and
she
went
through
the
world
croaking
let
hela
keep
what
she
holds
let
hela
keep
what
she
holds
then
hermod
knew
that
he
might
not
ride
to
hela
habitation
all
things
knew
that
there
was
one
thing
in
the
world
that
would
not
lament
for
baldur
the
vanir
came
back
to
him
and
with
head
bowed
over
mane
hermod
rode
into
asgard
now
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
knowing
that
no
ransom
would
be
taken
for
baldur
and
that
the
joy
and
content
of
asgard
were
gone
indeed
made
ready
his
body
for
the
burning
first
they
covered
baldur
body
with
a
rich
robe
and
each
left
beside
it
his
most
precious
possession
then
they
all
took
leave
of
him
kissing
him
upon
the
brow
but
nanna
his
gentle
wife
flung
herself
on
his
dead
breast
and
her
heart
broke
and
she
died
of
her
grief
then
did
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
weep
afresh
and
they
took
the
body
of
nanna
and
they
placed
it
side
by
side
with
baldur
on
his
own
great
ship
ringhorn
would
baldur
be
placed
with
nanna
beside
him
then
the
ship
would
be
launched
on
the
water
and
all
would
be
burned
with
fire
but
it
was
found
that
none
of
the
æsir
or
the
vanir
were
able
to
launch
baldur

ship
hyrroken
a
giantess

sent
for
she

mounted
on
a
great

with
twisted
serpents
for

four
giants
held
fast
the
wolf
when
she
alighted
she
came
to
the
ship
and
with
a
single
push
she
sent
it
into
the
sea
the
rollers
struck
out

as
the
ship
dashed
across
them
then
when
it
rode
the

fires
mounted
on
the

and
in
the
blaze
of
the
fires
one
was
seen
bending
over
the
body
of
baldur
and
whispering
into
his
ear
it
was
odin
then
he
went
down
off
the
ship
and
all
the
fires
rose
into
a
mighty
burning
speechlessly
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
watched
with
tears
streaming
down
their
faces
while
all
things
lamented
crying
baldur
the
beautiful

dead

dead
and
what
was
it
that
odin
whispered
to
baldur
as
he
bent
above
him
with
the
flames
of
the
burning
ship
around
he
whispered
of
a
heaven
above
asgard
that
surtur
flames
might
not
reach
and
of
a
life
that
would
come
to
beauty
again
after
the
world
of
men
and
the
world
of
the
gods
had
been
searched
through
and
through
with

the

flying

let

that
crow
was
the

transformed
and
the
hag
thaukt
was
loki
he
flew
to
the
north
and
came
into
the
wastes
of
jötunheim
as
a
crow
he
lived
there
hiding
himself
from
the
wrath
of
the
gods
he
told
the
giants
that
the
time
had
come
for
them
to
build
the
ship
naglfar
the
ship
that
was
to
be
built
out
of
the
nails
of
dead
men
and
that
was
to
sail
to
asgard
on
the
day
of
ragnarök
with
the
giant
hrymer
steering
it
and
harkening
to
what
he
said
the
giants
then
and
there
began
to
build
naglfar
the
ship
that
gods
and
men
wished
to
remain
unbuilt
for
long
then
loki
tiring
of
the
wastes
of
jötunheim
flew
to
the
burning
south
as
a
lizard
he
lived
amongst
the
rocks
of
muspelheim
and
he
made
the
fire
giants
rejoice
when
he
told
them
of
the
loss
of
frey
sword
and
of
tyr
right
hand
but
still
in
asgard
there
was
one
who
wept
for
loki
siguna
his
wife
although
he
had
left
her
and
had
shown
his
hatred
for
her
siguna
wept
for
her
evil
husband
he
left
muspelheim
as
he
had
left
jötunheim
and
he
came
to
live
in
the
world
of
men
he
knew
that
he
had
now
come
into
a
place
where
the
wrath
of
the
gods
might
find
him
and
so
he
made
plans
to
be
ever
ready
for
escape
he
had
come
to
the
river
where
ages
before
he
had
slain
the
otter
that
was
the
son
of
the
enchanter
and
on
the
very
rock
where
the
otter
had
eaten
the
salmon
on
the
day
of
his
killing
loki
built
his
house
he
made
four
doors
to
it
so
that
he
might
see
in
every
direction
and
the
power
that
he
kept
for
himself
was
the
power
of
transforming
himself
into
a
salmon
often
as
a
salmon
he
swam
in
the
river
but
even
for
the
fishes
that
swam
beside
him
loki
had
hatred
out
of
flax
and
yarn
he
wove
a
net
that
men
might
have
the
means
of
taking
them
out
of
the
water
the
wrath
that
the
gods
had
against
loki
did
not
pass
away
it
was
he
who
as
thaukt
the
hag
had
given
hela
the
power
to
keep
baldur
unransomed
it
was
he
who
had
put
into
hödur
hand
the
sprig
of
mistletoe
that
had
bereft
baldur
of
life
empty
was
asgard
now
that
baldur
lived
no
more
in
the
peace
stead
and
stern
and
gloomy
grew
the
minds
of
the
æsir
and
the
vanir
with
thinking
on
the
direful
things
that
were
arrayed
against
them
odin
in
his
hall
of
valhalla
thought
only
of
the
ways
by
which
he
could
bring
heroes
to
him
to
be
his
help
in
defending
asgard
the
gods
searched
through
the
world
and
they
found
at
last
the
place
where
loki
had
made
his
dwelling
he
was
weaving
the
net
to
take
fishes
when
he
saw
them
coming
from
four
directions
he
threw
the
net
into
the
fire
so
that
it
was
burnt
and
he
sprang
into
the
river
and
transformed
himself
into
a
salmon
when
the
gods
entered
his
dwelling
they
found
only
the
fire
but
there
was
one
amongst
them
who
could
understand
all
that
he
saw
in
the
ashes
were
the
marks
of
the
burnt
net
and
he
knew
that
these
were
the
tracing
of
something
to
catch
fishes
and
from
the
marks
left
in
the
ashes
he
made
a
net
that
was
the
same
as
the
one
loki
had
burnt
with
it
in
their
hands
the
gods
went
down
the
river
dragging
the
net
through
the
water
loki
was
affrighted
to
find
the
thing
of
his
own
weaving
brought
against
him
he
lay
between
two
stones
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
and
the
net
passed
over
him
but
the
gods
knew
that
the
net
had
touched
something
at
the
bottom
they
fastened
weights
to
it
and
they
dragged
the
net
through
the
river
again
loki
knew
that
he
might
not
escape
it
this
time
and
he
rose
in
the
water
and
swam
toward
the
sea
the
gods
caught
sight
of
him
as
he
leaped
over
a
waterfall
they
followed
him
dragging
the
net
thor
waded
behind
ready
to
seize
him
should
he
turn
back
loki
came
out
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
behold
there
was
a
great
eagle
hovering
over
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
ready
to
swoop
down
on
fishes
he
turned
back
in
the
river
he
made
a
leap
that
took
him
over
the
net
that
the
gods
were
dragging
but
thor
was
behind
the
net
and
he
caught
the
salmon
in
his
powerful
hands
and
he
held
him
for
all
the
struggle
that
loki
made
no
fish
had
ever
struggled
so
before
loki
got
himself
free
all
but
his
tail
but
thor
held
to
the
tail
and
brought
him
amongst
the
rocks
and
forced
him
to
take
on
his
proper
form
he
was
in
the
hands
of
those
whose
wrath
was
strong
against
him
they
brought
him
to
a
cavern
and
they
bound
him
to
three
rocks
with
cords
that
were
made
of
the
sinews
of
wolves
they
bound
him
and
they
transformed
the
cords
into
iron
bands
there
they
would
have
left
loki
bound
and
helpless
but
skadi
with
her
fierce
giant
blood
was
not
content
that
he
should
be
left
untormented
she
found
a
serpent
that
had
deadly
venom
and
she
hung
this
serpent
above
loki
head
the
drops
of
venom
fell
upon
him
bringing
him
anguish
drop
by
drop
minute
by
minute
so
loki
torture
went
on
but
siguna
with
the
pitying
heart
came
to
his
relief
she
exiled
herself
from
asgard
and
endured
the
darkness
and
the
cold
of
the
cavern
that
she
might
take
some
of
the
torment
away
from
him
who
was
her
husband
over
loki
siguna
stood
holding
in
her
hands
a
cup
into
which
fell
the
serpent
venom
thus
sparing
him
from
the
full
measure
of
anguish
now
and
then
siguna
had
to
turn
aside
to
spill
out
the
flowing
cup
and
then
the
drops
of
venom
fell
upon
loki
and
he
screamed
in
agony
twisting
in
his
bonds
it
was
then
that
men
felt
the
earth
quake
there
in
his
bonds
loki
stayed
until
the
coming
of
ragnarök

twilight
of
the

they
heard
the
din
of
a
great
battle
they
came
to
the
battlefield
but
they
found
no
living
warriors
on
it
only
heaps
of
slain
one
warrior
they
marked
he
was
and
old
and
yet
he
seemed
the
man
alv
or
his
father
had
ever
looked
on
his
arms
showed
that
he
was
a
king
amongst
one
of
the
bands
of
warriors
they
went
through
the
forest
searching
for
survivors
of
the
battle
and
hidden
in
a
dell
in
the
forest
they
came
upon
two
women
one
was
tall
with
blue
unflinching
eyes
and
ruddy
hair
but
wearing
the
garb
of
a
the
other
wore
the
rich
dress
of
a
queen
but
she
was
of
low
stature
and
her
manner
was
covert
and
shrinking
when
alv
and
his
father
drew
near
the
one
who
had
on
her
the
raiment
of
a
queen
said
help
us
lords
and
protect
us
and
we
will
show
you
where
a
treasure
is
hidden
a
great
battle
has
been
fought
between
the
men
of
king
lygni
and
the
men
of
king
sigmund
and
the
men
of
king
lygni
have
won
the
victory
and
have
gone
from
the
field
but
king
sigmund
is
slain
and
we
who
are
of
his
household
hid
his
treasure
and
we
can
show
it
to
you
the
noble
warrior
and
who
lies
yonder
is
he
king
sigmund
the
woman
answered
yes
lord
and
i
am
his
queen
we
have
heard
of
king
sigmund
said
alv
father
his
fame
and
the
fame
of
his
race
the
volsungs
is
over
the
wide
world
alv
said
no
word
to
either
of
the
women
but
his
eyes
stayed
on
the
one
who
had
on
the
garb
of
a
she
was
on
her
knees
wrapping
in
a
beast
skin
two
pieces
of
a
broken
sword

will
surely
protect
us
good
lords
said
she
who
had
on
the
queenly
dress
yea
wife
of
king
sigmund
we
will
protect
you
and
your
said
alv
father
the
old
king
then
the
women
took
the
warriors
to
a
wild
place
on
the
seashore
and
they
showed
them
where
king
sigmund
treasure
was
hidden
amongst
the
rocks
cups
of
gold
and
mighty
armrings
and
jeweled
collars
prince
alv
and
his
father
put
the
treasure
on
the
ship
and
brought
the
two
women
aboard
then
they
sailed
from
the
land
that
was
before
sigurd
the
fosterson
of
king
alv
was
born
now
the
mother
of
alv
was
wise
and
little
of
what
she
saw
escaped
her
noting
she
saw
that
of
the
two
women
that
her
son
and
her
husband
had
brought
into
their
kingdom
the
one
who
wore
the
dress
of
the

unflinching
eyes
and
a
high
beauty
while
the
one
who
wore
the
queenly
dress
was
shrinking
and
unstately
one
night
when
all
the
women
of
the
household
were
sitting
round
her
spinning
wool
by
the
light
of
torches
in
the
hall
the
said
to
the
one
who
wore
the
queenly
garb

art
good
at
rising
in
the
morning
how
dost
thou
know
in
the
dark
hours
when
it
wears
to
dawn
the
one
clad
in
the
queenly
garb
said
when
i
was
young
i
used
to
rise
to
milk
the
cows
and
i
waken
ever
since
at
the
same
hour
the
said
to
herself

is
a
strange
country
in
which
the
royal
maids

to
milk
the
cows
then
she
said
to
the
one
who
wore
the
clothes
of
the
how

thou
know
in
the
dark
hours
when
the
dawn
is
coming
my
father
she
said

me
the
ring
of
gold
that
i
wear
and
always
before
it
is
time
to
rise

cold
on
my
finger
it
is
a
strange
country
truly
said
the
to
herself
in
which
the

of
gold
when
all
the
others
had
left
she
spoke
to
the
two
women
who
had
been
brought
into
her
country
to
the
one
who
wore
the
clothes
of
a
she
said
thou
art
the
queen
then
the
one
who
wore
the
queenly
clothes
said
thou
art
right
lady
she
is
the
queen
and
i
can
not
any
longer
pretend
to
be
other
than
i
am
then
the
other
woman
spoke
said
she
i
am
the
queen
as
thou
hast
said
the
queen
of
king
sigmund
who
was
slain
because
a
king
sought
for
me
i
changed
clothes
with
my
my
wish
being
to
baffle
those
who
might
be
sent
to
carry
me
away
know
that
i
am
hiordis
a
king
daughter
many
men
came
to
my
father
to
ask
for
me
in
marriage
and
of
those
that
came
there
were
two
whom
i
heard
much
of
one
was
king
lygni
and
the
other
was
king
sigmund
of
the
race
of
the
volsungs
the
king
my
father
told
me
it
was
for
me
to
choose
between
these
two
now
king
sigmund
was
old
but
he
was
the
most
famous
warrior
in
the
whole
world
and
i
chose
him
rather
than
king
lygni
we
were
wed
but
king
lygni
did
not
lose
desire
of
me
and
in
a
while
he
came
against
king
sigmund
kingdom
with
a
great
army
of
men
we
hid
our
treasure
by
the
seashore
and
i
and
my
maid
watched
the
battle
from
the
borders
of
the
forest
with
the
help
of
gram
his
wondrous
sword
and
his
own
great
warrior
strength
sigmund
was
able
to
harry
the
great
force
that
came
against
him
but
suddenly
he
was
stricken
down
then
was
the
battle
lost
only
king
lygni
men
survived
it
and
they
scattered
to
search
for
me
and
the
treasure
of
the
king
i
came
to
where
my
lord
lay
on
the
field
of
battle
and
he
raised
himself
on
his
shield
when
i
came
and
he
told
me
that
death
was
very
near
him
a
stranger
had
entered
the
battle
at
the
time
when
it
seemed
that
the
men
of
king
lygni
must
draw
away
with
the
spear
that
he
held
in
his
hand
he
struck
at
sigmund
sword
and
gram
the
wondrous
sword
was
broken
in
two
pieces
then
did
king
sigmund
get
his
must
be
i
shall
die
he
said
the
spear
against
which
my
sword
broke
was
gungnir
odin
spear
only
that
spear
could
have
shattered
the
sword
that
odin
gave
my
fathers
now
must
i
go
to
valhalla
hall
of
heroes
weep
i
said
i
have
no
son
who
might
call
himself
of
the
great
race
of
the
volsungs
that
you
need
not
weep
said
sigmund
son
will
be
born
to
you
my
son
and
yours
and
you
shall
name
him
sigurd
take
now
the
broken
pieces
of
my
wondrous
sword
and
give
them
to
my
son
when
he
shall
be
of
warrior
age
then
did
sigmund
turn
his
face
to
the
ground
and
the
came
on
him
odin
valkyrie
took
his
spirit
from
the
battlefield
and
i
lifted
up
the
broken
pieces
of
the
sword
and
with
my
i
went
and
hid
in
a
deep
dell
in
the
forest
then
your
husband
and
your
son
found
us
and
they
brought
us
to
your
kingdom
where
we
have
been
kindly
treated
o
queen
such
was
the
history
that
hiordis
the
wife
of
king
sigmund
told
to
the
mother
of
prince
alv
soon
afterwards
the
child
was
born
to
her
that
was
sigmund
son
sigurd
she
named
him
and
after
sigurd
was
born
the
old
king
died
and
prince
alv
became
king
in
his
stead
he
married
hiordis
she
of
the
ruddy
hair
the
unflinching
ways
and
the
high
beauty
and
he
brought
up
her
son
sigurd
in
his
house
as
his
fosterson
sigurd
the
son
of
sigmund
before
he
came
to
warrior
age
was
known
for
his
strength
and
his
swiftness
and
for
the
fearlessness
that
shone
round
him
like
a
glow
mighty
was
the
race
he
sprang
from
the
volsung
race
men
said
but
sigurd
will
be
as
mighty
as
any
that
have
gone
before
him
he
built
himself
a
hut
in
the
forest
that
he
might
hunt
wild
beasts
and
live
near
to
one
who
was
to
train
him
in
many
crafts
this
one
was
regin
a
maker
of
swords
and
a
cunning
man
besides
it
was
said
of
regin
that
he
was
an
enchanter
and
that
he
had
been
in
the
world
for
longer
than
the
generations
of
men
no
one
remembered
nor
no
father
remembered
when
regin
had
come
into
that
country
he
taught
sigurd
the
art
of
working
in
metals
and
he
taught
him
too
the
lore
of
other
days
but
ever
as
he
taught
him
he
looked
at
sigurd
strangely
not
as
a
man
looks
at
his
fellow
but
as
a
lynx
looks
at
a
stronger
beast
one
day
regin
said
to
young
sigurd
king
alv
has
thy
father
treasure
men
say
and
yet
he
treats
thee
as
if
thou
wert
now
sigurd
knew
that
regin
said
this
that
he
might
anger
him
and
thereafter
use
him
to
his
own
ends
he
said
king
alv
is
a
wise
and
a
good
king
and
he
would
let
me
have
riches
if
i
had
need
of
them
thou
dost
go
about
as
a
footboy
and
not
as
a
king
son
any
day
that
it
likes
me
i
might
have
a
horse
to
ride
sigurd
said
so
thou
dost
say
said
regin
and
he
turned
from
sigurd
and
went
to
blow
the
fire
of
his
smithy
sigurd
was
made
angry
and
he
threw
down
the
irons
on
which
he
was
working
and
he
ran
to
the
by
the
great
river
a
herd
of
horses
was
there
gray
and
black
and
roan
and
chestnut
the
best
of
the
horses
that
king
alv
possessed
as
he
came
near
to
where
the
herd
grazed
he
saw
a
stranger
near
an
ancient
but
robust
man
wearing
a
strange
cloak
of
blue
and
leaning
on
a
staff
to
watch
the
horses
sigurd
though
young
had
seen
kings
in
their
halls
but
this
man
had
a
bearing
that
was
more
lofty
than
any
king
he
had
ever
looked
on
thou
art
going
to
choose
a
horse
for
thyself
said
the
stranger
to
sigurd
yea
father
sigurd
said
drive
the
herd
first
into
the
river
the
stranger
said
sigurd
drove
the
horses
into
the
wide
river
some
were
swept
down
by
the
current
others
struggled
back
and
clambered
up
the
bank
of
the
pastures
but
one
swam
across
the
river
and
throwing
up
his
head
neighed
as
for
a
victory
sigurd
marked
him
a
gray
horse
he
was
young
and
proud
with
a
great
flowing
mane
he
went
through
the
water
and
caught
this
horse
mounted
him
and
brought
him
back
across
the
river
thou
hast
done
well
said
the
stranger
grani
whom
thou
hast
got
is
of
the
breed
of
sleipner
the
horse
of
odin
and
i
am
of
the
race
of
the
sons
of
odin
cried
sigurd
his
eyes
wide
and
shining
with
the
very
light
of
the
sun
i
am
of
the
race
of
the
sons
of
odin
for
my
father
was
sigmund
and
his
father
was
volsung
and
his
father
was
rerir
and
his
father
was
sigi
who
was
the
son
of
odin
the
stranger
leaning
on
his
staff
looked
on
the
youth
steadily
only
one
of
his
eyes
was
to
be
seen
but
that
eye
sigurd
thought
might
see
through
a
stone
all
thou
hast
named
the
stranger
said
were
as
swords
of
odin
to
send
men
to
valhalla
odin
hall
of
heroes
and
of
all
that
thou
hast
named
there
were
none
but
were
chosen
by
valkyries
for
battles
in
asgard
cried
sigurd
too
much
of
what
is
brave
and
noble
in
the
world
is
taken
by
odin
for
his
battles
in
asgard
the
stranger
leaned
on
his
staff
and
his
head
was
bowed
what
wouldst
thou
he
said
and
it
did
not
seem
to
sigurd
that
he
spoke
to
him
what
wouldst
thou
the
leaves
wither
and
fall
off
ygdrassil
and
the
day
of
ragnarök
comes
then
he
raised
his
head
and
spoke
to
sigurd
the
time
is
near
he
said
when
thou
mayst
possess
thyself
of
the
pieces
of
thy
father
sword
then
the
man
in
the
strange
cloak
of
blue
went
climbing
up
the
hill
and
sigurd
watched
him
pass
away
from
his
sight
he
had
held
back
grani
his
proud
horse
but
now
he
turned
him
and
let
him
gallop
along
the
river
in
a
race
that
was
as
swift
as
the
wind
illustration
the
sword
gram
and
the
dragon
fafnir
mounted
upon
grani
his
proud
horse
sigurd
rode
to
the
hall
and
showed
himself
to
alv
the
king
and
to
hiordis
his
mother
before
the
hall
he
shouted
out
the
volsung
name
and
king
alv
felt
as
he
watched
him
that
this
youth
was
a
match
for
a
score
of
men
and
hiordis
his
mother
saw
the
blue
flame
of
his
eyes
and
thought
to
herself
that
his
way
through
the
world
would
be
as
the
way
of
the
eagle
through
the
air
having
shown
himself
before
the
hall
sigurd
dismounted
from
grani
and
stroked
and
caressed
him
with
his
hands
and
told
him
that
now
he
might
go
back
and
take
pasture
with
the
herd
the
proud
horse
breathed
fondly
over
sigurd
and
bounded
away
then
sigurd
strode
on
until
he
came
to
the
hut
in
the
forest
where
he
worked
with
the
cunning
smith
regin
no
one
was
in
the
hut
when
he
entered
but
over
the
anvil
in
the
smoke
of
the
smithy
fire
there
was
a
work
of
regin
hands
sigurd
looked
upon
it
and
a
hatred
for
the
thing
that
was
shown
rose
up
in
him
the
work
of
regin
hands
was
a
shield
a
great
shield
of
iron
hammered
out
on
that
shield
and
colored
with
red
and
brown
colors
was
the
image
of
a
dragon
a
dragon
lengthening
himself
out
of
a
cave
sigurd
thought
it
was
the
image
of
the
most
hateful
thing
in
the
world
and
the
light
of
the
smithy
fire
falling
on
it
and
the
smoke
of
the
smithy
fire
rising
round
it
made
it
seem
verily
a
dragon
living
in
his
own
element
of
fire
and
reek
while
he
was
still
gazing
on
the
loathly
image
regin
the
cunning
smith
came
into
the
smithy
he
stood
by
the
wall
and
he
watched
sigurd
his
back
was
bent
his
hair
fell
over
his
eyes
that
were
all
fiery
and
he
looked
like
a
beast
that
runs
behind
the
hedges
aye
thou
dost
look
on
fafnir
the
dragon
son
of
the
volsungs
he
said
to
sigurd
mayhap
it
is
thou
who
wilt
slay
him
i
would
not
strive
with
such
a
beast
he
is
all
horrible
to
me
sigurd
said
with
a
good
sword
thou
mightst
slay
him
and
win
for
thyself
more
renown
than
ever
thy
fathers
had
regin
whispered
i
shall
win
renown
as
my
fathers
won
renown
in
battle
with
men
and
in
conquest
of
kingdoms
sigurd
said
thou
art
not
a
true
volsung
or
thou
wouldst
gladly
go
where
most
danger
and
dread
is
said
regin
thou
hast
heard
of
fafnir
the
dragon
whose
image
i
have
wrought
here
if
thou
dost
ride
to
the
crest
of
the
hills
thou
mayst
look
across
to
the
desolate
land
where
fafnir
has
his
haunt
know
that
once
it
was
fair
land
where
men
had
peace
and
prosperity
but
fafnir
came
and
made
his
den
in
a
cave
near
by
and
his
breathings
as
he
went
to
and
came
from
the
river
withered
up
the
land
and
made
it
the
barren
waste
that
men
called
gnita
heath
now
if
thou
art
a
true
volsung
thou
wilt
slay
the
dragon
and
let
that
land
become
fair
again
and
bring
the
people
back
to
it
and
so
add
to
king
alv
domain
i
have
nought
to
do
with
the
slaying
of
dragons
sigurd
said
i
have
to
make
war
on
king
lygni
and
avenge
upon
him
the
slaying
of
sigmund
my
father
what
is
the
slaying
of
lygni
and
the
conquest
of
his
kingdom
to
the
slaying
of
fafnir
the
dragon
regin
cried
i
will
tell
thee
what
no
one
else
knows
of
fafnir
the
dragon
he
guards
a
hoard
of
gold
and
jewels
the
like
of
which
was
never
seen
in
the
world
all
this
hoard
you
can
make
yours
by
slaying
him
i
do
not
covet
riches
sigurd
said
no
riches
is
like
to
the
riches
that
fafnir
guards
his
hoard
is
the
hoard
that
the
dwarf
andvari
had
from
the
world
early
days
once
the
gods
themselves
paid
it
over
as
a
ransom
and
if
thou
wilt
win
this
hoard
thou
wilt
be
as
one
of
the
gods
how
dost
thou
know
that
of
which
thou
speakst
regin
sigurd
said
i
know
and
one
day
i
may
tell
thee
how
i
know
and
one
day
i
may
harken
to
thee
but
speak
to
me
no
more
of
this
dragon
i
would
have
thee
make
a
sword
a
sword
that
will
be
mightier
and
better
shapen
than
any
sword
in
the
world
thou
canst
do
this
regin
for
thou
art
accounted
the
best
swordsmith
amongst
men
regin
looked
at
sigurd
out
of
his
small
and
cunning
eyes
and
he
thought
it
was
best
to
make
himself
active
so
he
took
the
weightiest
pieces
of
iron
and
put
them
into
his
furnace
and
he
brought
out
the
secret
tools
that
he
used
when
a
masterwork
was
claimed
from
his
hands
all
day
sigurd
worked
beside
him
keeping
the
fire
at
its
best
glow
and
bringing
water
to
cool
the
blade
as
it
was
fashioned
and
refashioned
and
as
he
worked
he
thought
only
about
the
blade
and
about
how
he
would
make
war
upon
king
lygni
and
avenge
the
man
who
was
slain
before
he
himself
was
born
all
day
he
thought
only
of
war
and
of
the
beaten
blade
but
at
night
his
dreams
were
not
upon
wars
nor
shapen
blades
but
upon
fafnir
the
dragon
he
saw
the
heath
that
was
left
barren
by
his
breath
and
he
saw
the
cave
where
he
had
his
den
and
he
saw
him
crawling
down
from
his
cave
his
scales
glittering
like
rings
of
mail
and
his
length
the
length
of
a
company
of
men
on
the
march
the
next
day
he
worked
with
regin
to
shape
the
great
sword
when
it
was
shapen
with
all
the
cunning
regin
knew
it
looked
indeed
a
mighty
sword
then
regin
sharpened
it
and
sigurd
polished
it
and
at
last
he
held
the
great
sword
by
its
iron
hilt
then
sigurd
took
the
shield
that
had
the
image
of
fafnir
the
dragon
upon
it
and
he
put
the
shield
over
the
anvil
of
the
smithy
raising
the
great
sword
in
both
his
hands
he
struck
full
on
the
iron
shield
the
stroke
of
the
sword
sheared
away
some
of
the
shield
but
the
blade
broke
in
sigurd
hands
then
in
anger
he
turned
on
regin
crying
out
thou
hast
made
a
knave
sword
for
me
to
work
with
thee
again
thou
must
make
me
a
volsung
sword
then
he
went
out
and
called
to
grani
his
horse
and
mounted
him
and
rode
to
the
river
bank
like
the
sweep
of
the
wind
regin
took
more
pieces
of
iron
and
began
to
forge
a
new
sword
uttering
as
he
worked
runes
that
were
about
the
hoard
that
fafnir
the
dragon
guarded
and
sigurd
that
night
dreamt
of
glittering
treasure
that
he
coveted
not
masses
of
gold
and
heaps
of
glistening
jewels
he
was
regin
help
the
next
day
and
they
both
worked
to
make
a
sword
that
would
be
mightier
than
the
first
for
three
days
they
worked
upon
it
and
then
regin
put
into
sigurd
hands
a
sword
sharpened
and
polished
that
was
mightier
and
more
splendid
looking
than
the
one
that
had
been
forged
before
and
again
sigurd
took
the
shield
that
had
the
image
of
the
dragon
upon
it
and
he
put
it
upon
the
anvil
then
he
raised
his
arms
and
struck
his
full
blow
the
sword
cut
through
the
shield
but
when
it
struck
the
anvil
it
shivered
in
his
hands
he
left
the
smithy
angrily
and
called
to
grani
his
proud
horse
he
mounted
and
rode
on
like
the
sweep
of
the
wind
later
he
came
to
his
mother
bower
and
stood
before
hiordis
a
greater
sword
must
i
have
said
he
than
one
that
is
made
of
metal
dug
out
of
the
earth
the
time
has
come
mother
when
thou
must
put
into
my
hands
the
broken
pieces
of
gram
the
sword
of
sigmund
and
the
volsungs
hiordis
measured
him
with
the
glance
of
her
eyes
and
she
saw
that
her
son
was
a
mighty
youth
and
one
fit
to
use
the
sword
of
sigmund
and
the
volsungs
she
bade
him
go
with
her
to
the
king
hall
out
of
the
great
stone
chest
that
was
in
her
chamber
she
took
the
beast
skin
and
the
broken
blade
that
was
wrapped
in
it
she
gave
the
pieces
into
the
hands
of
her
son
behold
the
halves
of
gram
she
said
of
gram
the
mighty
sword
that
in
the
days
odin
left
in
the
branstock
in
the
tree
of
the
house
of
volsung
i
would
see
gram
in
thy
hands
my
son
then
she
embraced
him
as
she
had
never
embraced
him
before
and
standing
there
with
her
ruddy
hair
about
her
she
told
him
of
the
glory
of
gram
and
of
the
deeds
of
his
fathers
in
whose
hands
the
sword
had
shone
then
sigurd
went
to
the
smithy
and
he
wakened
regin
out
of
his
sleep
and
he
made
him
look
on
the
shining
halves
of
sigmund
sword
he
commanded
him
to
make
out
of
these
halves
a
sword
for
his
hand
regin
worked
for
days
in
his
smithy
and
sigurd
never
left
his
side
at
last
the
blade
was
forged
and
when
sigurd
held
it
in
his
hand
fire
ran
along
the
edge
of
it
again
he
laid
the
shield
that
had
the
image
of
the
dragon
upon
it
on
the
anvil
of
the
smithy
again
with
his
hands
on
its
iron
hilt
he
raised
the
sword
for
a
full
stroke
he
struck
and
the
sword
cut
through
the
shield
and
sheared
through
the
anvil
cutting
away
its
iron
horn
then
did
sigurd
know
that
he
had
in
his
hands
the
volsungs
sword
he
went
without
and
called
to
grani
and
like
the
sweep
of
the
wind
rode
down
to
the
river
bank
shreds
of
wool
were
floating
down
the
water
sigurd
struck
at
them
with
his
sword
and
the
fine
wool
was
divided
against
the
water
edge
hardness
and
fineness
gram
could
cut
through
both
that
night
gram
the
volsungs
sword
was
under
his
head
when
he
slept
but
still
his
dreams
were
filled
with
images
that
he
had
not
regarded
in
the
day
time
the
shine
of
a
hoard
that
he
coveted
not
and
the
gleam
of
the
scales
of
a
dragon
that
was
too
loathly
for
him
to
battle
with
illustration
the
dragon
blood
sigurd
went
to
war
with
the
men
that
king
alv
gave
him
he
marched
into
the
country
that
was
ruled
over
by
the
slayer
of
his
father
the
war
that
he
waged
was
short
and
the
battles
that
he
won
were
not
perilous
old
was
king
lygni
now
and
feeble
was
his
grasp
upon
his
people
sigurd
slew
him
and
took
away
his
treasure
and
added
his
lands
to
the
lands
of
king
alv
but
sigurd
was
not
content
with
the
victory
he
had
gained
he
had
dreamt
of
stark
battles
and
of
renown
that
would
be
hardily
won
what
was
the
war
he
had
waged
to
the
wars
that
sigmund
his
father
and
volsung
his
father
father
had
waged
in
their
days
not
content
was
sigurd
he
led
his
men
back
by
the
hills
from
the
crests
of
which
he
could
look
upon
the
dragon
haunts
and
having
come
as
far
as
those
hills
he
bade
his
men
return
to
king
alv
hall
with
the
spoils
he
had
won
they
went
and
sigurd
stayed
upon
the
hills
and
looked
across
gnita
heath
to
where
fafnir
the
dragon
had
his
lair
all
blasted
and
wasted
was
the
heath
with
the
fiery
breath
of
the
dragon
and
he
saw
the
cave
where
fafnir
abode
and
he
saw
the
track
that
his
comings
and
goings
made
for
every
day
the
dragon
left
his
cave
in
the
cliffs
crossing
the
heath
to
come
to
the
river
at
which
he
drank
for
the
length
of
a
day
sigurd
watched
from
the
hills
the
haunt
of
the
dragon
in
the
evening
he
saw
him
lengthening
himself
out
of
the
cave
and
coming
on
his
track
across
the
heath
in
seeming
like
a
ship
that
travels
swiftly
because
of
its
many
oars
then
to
regin
in
his
smithy
he
came
to
that
cunning
man
sigurd
said
tell
me
all
thou
dost
know
of
fafnir
the
dragon
regin
began
to
talk
but
his
speech
was
old
and
strange
and
filled
with
runes
when
he
had
spoken
it
all
sigurd
said
all
thou
hast
told
me
thou
wilt
have
to
say
over
again
in
a
speech
that
is
known
to
men
of
our
day
then
said
regin
of
a
hoard
i
spoke
the
dwarf
andvari
guarded
it
from
the
first
days
of
the
world
but
one
of
the
æsir
forced
andvari
to
give
the
hoard
to
him
masses
of
gold
and
heaps
of
jewels
and
the
æsir
gave
it
to
hreidmar
who
was
my
father
for
the
slaying
of
his
son
otter
the
æsir
gave
the
hoard
to
hreidmar
the
greatest
hoard
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
the
world
but
not
long
was
it
left
to
hreidmar
to
gloat
over
for
a
son
slew
a
father
that
he
might
possess
that
hoard
fafnir
that
son
was
fafnir
my
brother
then
fafnir
that
no
one
might
disturb
his
possession
of
the
hoard
turned
himself
into
a
dragon
a
dragon
so
fearful
that
none
dare
come
nigh
him
and
i
regin
was
stricken
with
covetousness
of
the
hoard
i
did
not
change
myself
into
another
being
but
by
the
magic
my
father
knew
i
made
my
life
longer
than
the
generations
of
men
hoping
that
i
would
see
fafnir
slain
and
then
have
the
mighty
hoard
under
my
hands
now
son
of
the
volsungs
thou
dost
know
all
that
has
to
do
with
fafnir
the
dragon
and
the
great
hoard
that
he
guards
little
do
i
care
about
the
hoard
he
guards
sigurd
said
i
care
only
that
he
has
made
the
king
good
lands
into
a
waste
and
that
he
is
an
evil
thing
to
men
i
would
have
the
renown
of
slaying
fafnir
the
dragon
with
gram
the
sword
thou
hast
thou
couldst
slay
fafnir
regin
cried
his
body
shaken
with
his
passion
for
the
hoard
thou
couldst
slay
him
with
the
sword
thou
hast
harken
now
and
i
will
tell
thee
how
thou
mightst
give
him
the
deathly
stroke
through
the
coils
of
his
mail
harken
for
i
have
thought
of
it
all
the
track
of
the
dragon
to
the
river
is
broad
for
he
takes
ever
the
one
track
dig
a
pit
in
the
middle
of
that
track
and
when
fafnir
comes
over
it
strike
up
into
his
coils
of
mail
with
gram
thy
great
sword
gram
only
may
pierce
that
mail
then
will
fafnir
be
slain
and
the
hoard
will
be
left
guardless
what
thou
sayst
is
wise
regin
sigurd
answered
we
will
make
this
pit
and
i
will
strike
fafnir
in
the
way
thou
sayst
then
sigurd
went
and
he
rode
upon
grani
his
proud
horse
and
he
showed
himself
to
king
alv
and
to
hiordis
his
mother
afterwards
he
went
with
regin
to
the
heath
that
was
the
haunt
of
the
dragon
and
in
his
track
they
dug
a
pit
for
the
slaying
of
fafnir
and
lest
his
horse
should
scream
aloud
at
the
coming
of
the
dragon
sigurd
had
grani
sent
back
to
a
cave
in
the
hills
it
was
regin
that
brought
grani
away
i
am
fearful
and
can
do
nothing
to
help
thee
son
of
the
volsungs
he
said
i
will
go
away
and
await
the
slaying
of
fafnir
he
went
and
sigurd
lay
down
in
the
pit
they
had
made
and
practiced
thrusting
upward
with
his
sword
he
lay
with
his
face
upward
and
with
his
two
hands
he
thrust
the
mighty
sword
upward
but
as
he
lay
there
he
bethought
of
a
dread
thing
that
might
happen
namely
that
the
blood
and
the
venom
of
the
dragon
might
pour
over
him
as
he
lay
there
and
waste
him
flesh
and
bone
when
he
thought
of
this
sigurd
hastened
out
of
the
pit
and
he
dug
other
pits
near
by
and
he
made
a
passage
for
himself
from
one
pit
to
the
other
that
he
might
escape
from
the
flow
of
the
dragon
envenomed
blood
as
he
lay
down
again
in
the
pit
he
heard
the
treading
of
the
dragon
and
he
heard
the
dragon
strange
and
mournful
cry
mightily
the
dragon
came
on
and
he
heard
his
breathing
his
shape
came
over
the
pit
then
the
dragon
held
his
head
and
looked
down
on
sigurd
it
was
the
instant
for
him
to
make
stroke
with
gram
he
did
not
let
the
instant
pass
he
struck
mightily
under
the
shoulder
and
toward
the
heart
of
the
beast
the
sword
went
through
the
hard
and
glittering
scales
that
were
the
creature
mail
sigurd
pulled
out
the
sword
and
drew
himself
through
the
passage
and
out
into
the
second
pit
as
fafnir
envenomed
blood
drenched
where
he
had
been
drawing
himself
up
out
of
the
second
pit
he
saw
the
huge
shape
of
fafnir
heaving
and
lashing
he
came
to
him
and
thrust
his
sword
right
through
the
dragon
neck
the
dragon
reared
up
as
though
to
fling
himself
down
on
sigurd
with
all
his
crushing
bulk
and
dread
talons
with
his
fiery
breath
and
his
envenomed
blood
but
sigurd
leaped
aside
and
ran
far
off
then
did
fafnir
scream
his
death
scream
after
he
had
torn
up
rocks
with
his
talons
he
lay
prone
on
the
ground
his
head
in
the
pit
that
was
filled
with
his
envenomed
blood
then
did
regin
hearing
the
scream
that
let
him
know
that
fafnir
was
slain
come
down
to
where
the
battle
had
been
fought
when
he
saw
that
sigurd
was
alive
and
unharmed
he
uttered
a
cry
of
fury
for
his
plan
had
been
to
have
sigurd
drowned
and
burnt
in
the
pit
with
the
stream
of
fafnir
envenomed
blood
but
he
mastered
his
fury
and
showed
a
pleased
countenance
to
sigurd
now
thou
wilt
have
renown
he
cried
forever
wilt
thou
be
called
sigurd
fafnir
bane
more
renown
than
ever
any
of
thy
fathers
had
wilt
thou
have
o
prince
of
the
volsungs
so
he
spoke
saying
fair
words
to
him
for
now
that
he
was
left
alive
there
was
something
he
would
have
sigurd
do
fafnir
is
slain
sigurd
said
and
the
triumph
over
him
was
not
lightly
won
now
may
i
show
myself
to
king
alv
and
to
my
mother
and
the
gold
from
fafnir
hoard
will
make
me
a
great
spoil
wait
said
regin
cunningly
wait
thou
hast
yet
to
do
something
for
me
with
the
sword
thou
hast
cut
through
the
dragon
and
take
out
his
heart
for
me
when
thou
hast
taken
it
out

that
i
may
eat
of
it
and
become
wiser
than
i
am
do
this
for
me
who
showed
thee
how
to
slay
fafnir
sigurd
did
what
regin
would
have
him

he
cut
out
the
heart
of
the
dragon
and
he
hung
it
from
stakes
to
roast
regin
drew
away
and
left
him
as
sigurd
stood
before
the
fire
putting
sticks
upon
it
there
was
a
great
silence
in
the
forest
he
put
his
hand
down
to
turn
an
ashen
branch
into
the
heart
of
the
fire
as
he
did
a
drop
from
the
roasting
fell
upon
his
hand
the
drop
burnt
into
him
he
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
to
ease
the
smart
and
his
tongue
tasted
the
burning
blood
of
the
dragon
he
went
to
gather
wood
for
the
fire
in
a
clearing
that
he
came
to
there
were
birds
he
saw
four
on
a
branch
together
they
spoke
to
each
other
in
birds
notes
and
sigurd
heard
and
knew
what
they
were
saying
said
the
first
bird
how
simple
is
he
who
has
come
into
this
dell
he
has
no
thought
of
an
enemy
and
yet
he
who
was
with
him
but
a
while
ago
has
gone
away
that
he
may
bring
a
spear
to
slay
him
for
the
sake
of
the
gold
that
is
in
the
dragon
cave
he
would
slay
him
said
the
second
bird
and
the
third
bird
said
if
he
would
eat
the
dragon
heart
himself
he
would
know
all
wisdom
but
the
fourth
bird
said
he
has
tasted
a
drop
of
the
dragon
blood
and
he
knows
what
we
are
saying
the
four
birds
did
not
fly
away
nor
cease
from
speaking
instead
they
began
to
tell
of
a
marvelous
abode
that
was
known
to
them
deep
in
the
forest
the
birds
sang
there
was
a
hall
that
was
called
the
house
of
flame
its
ten
walls
were
uni
iri
barri
ori
varns
vegdrasil
derri
uri
dellinger
atvarder
and
each
wall
was
built
by
the
dwarf
whose
name
it
bore
all
round
the
hall
there
was
a
circle
of
fire
through
which
none
might
pass
and
within
the
hall
a
maiden
slept
and
she
was
the
wisest
and
the
bravest
and
the
most
beautiful
maiden
in
the
world
sigurd
stood
like
a
man
enchanted
listening
to
what
the
birds
sang
but
suddenly
they
changed
the
flow
of
their
discourse
and
their
notes
became
sharp
and
piercing
look
look
cried
one
he
is
coming
against
the
youth
he
is
coming
against
the
youth
with
a
spear
cried
another
now
will
the
youth
be
slain
unless
he
is
swift
cried
a
third
sigurd
turned
round
and
he
saw
regin
treading
the
way
toward
him
grim
and
silent
with
a
spear
in
his
hands
the
spear
would
have
gone
through
sigurd
had
he
stayed
one
instant
longer
in
the
place
where
he
had
been
listening
to
the
speech
of
the
birds
as
he
turned
he
had
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
he
flung
it
and
gram
struck
regin
on
the
breast
then
regin
cried
out
i
die
i
die
without
having
laid
my
hands
on
the
hoard
that
fafnir
guarded
ah
a
curse
was
upon
the
hoard
for
hreidmar
and
fafnir
and
i
have
perished
because
of
it
may
the
curse
of
the
gold
now
fall
on
the
one
who
is
my
slayer
then
did
regin
breathe
out
his
life
sigurd
took
the
body
and
cast
it
into
the
pit
that
was
alongside
the
dead
fafnir
then
that
he
might
eat
the
dragon
heart
and
become
the
wisest
of
men
he
went
to
where
he
had
left
it
roasting
and
he
thought
that
when
he
had
eaten
the
heart
he
would
go
into
the
dragon
cave
and
carry
away
the
treasure
that
was
there
and
bring
it
as
spoil
of
his
battle
to
king
alv
and
to
his
mother
then
he
would
go
through
the
forest
and
find
the
house
of
flame
where
slept
the
maiden
who
was
the
wisest
and
bravest
and
most
beautiful
in
the
world
but
sigurd
did
not
eat
the
dragon
heart
when
he
came
to
where
he
had
left
it
roasting
he
found
that
the
fire
had
burnt
it
utterly
illustration
the
story
of
sigmund
and
signy
he
called
to
grani
his
proud
horse
he
stood
up
on
a
mound
in
the
heath
and
he
sent
forth
a
great
shout
and
grani
heard
in
the
cave
where
regin
had
left
him
and
he
came
galloping
to
sigurd
with
flowing
mane
and
eyes
flashing
fire
he
mounted
grani
and
he
rode
to
fafnir
cave
when
he
went
into
the
place
where
the
dragon
was
wont
to
lie
he
saw
a
door
of
iron
before
him
with
gram
his
mighty
sword
he
hewed
through
the
iron
and
with
his
strong
hands
he
pulled
the
door
back
then
before
him
he
saw
the
treasure
the
dragon
guarded
masses
of
gold
and
heaps
of
shining
jewels
but
as
he
looked
on
the
hoard
sigurd
felt
some
shadow
of
the
evil
that
lay
over
it
all
this
was
the
hoard
that
in
the
days
the
watched
over
as
it
lay
deep
under
the
flowing
water
then
andvari
the
dwarf
forced
the
to
give
it
to
him
and
loki
had
taken
it
from
andvari
letting
loose
as
he
did
gulveig
the
witch
who
had
such
evil
power
over
the
gods
for
the
sake
of
the
hoard
fafnir
had
slain
hreidmar
his
father
and
regin
had
plotted
death
against
fafnir
his
brother
not
all
this
history
did
sigurd
know
but
a
shadow
of
its
evil
touched
his
spirit
as
he
stood
there
before
the
gleaming
and
glittering
heap
he
would
take
all
of
it
away
but
not
now
the
tale
that
the
birds
told
was
in
his
mind
and
the
green
of
the
forest
was
more
to
him
than
the
glitter
of
the
treasure
heap
he
would
come
back
with
chests
and
load
it
up
and
carry
it
to
king
alv
hall
but
first
he
would
take
such
things
as
he
himself
might
wear
he
found
a
helmet
of
gold
and
he
put
it
on
his
head
he
found
a
great
armring
and
his
put
it
around
his
arm
on
the
top
of
the
armring
there
was
a
small
fingerring
with
a
rune
graved
upon
it
sigurd
put
it
on
his
finger
and
this
was
the
ring
that
andvari
the
dwarf
had
put
the
curse
upon
when
loki
had
taken
the
hoard
from
him
he
knew
that
no
one
would
cross
the
heath
and
come
to
fafnir
lair
so
he
did
not
fear
to
leave
the
treasure
unguarded
he
mounted
grani
his
proud
horse
and
rode
toward
the
forest
he
would
seek
the
house
of
flame
where
she
lay
sleeping
the
maiden
who
was
the
wisest
and
the
bravest
and
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
with
his
golden
helmet
shining
above
his
golden
hair
sigurd
rode
on
as
he
rode
toward
the
forest
he
thought
of
sigmund
his
father
whose
slaying
he
had
avenged
and
he
thought
of
sigmund
father
volsung
and
of
the
grim
deeds
that
the
volsungs
had
suffered
and
wrought
rerir
the
son
of
sigi
who
was
the
son
of
odin
was
the
father
of
volsung
and
volsung
when
he
was
in
his
first
manhood
had
built
his
hall
around
a
mighty
tree
its
branches
went
up
to
the
roof
and
made
the
beams
of
the
house
and
its
great
trunk
was
the
center
of
the
hall
the
branstock
the
tree
was
called
and
volsung
hall
was
named
the
hall
of
the
branstock
many
children
had
volsung
eleven
sons
and
one
daughter
strong
were
all
his
sons
and
good
fighters
and
volsung
of
the
hall
of
the
branstock
was
a
mighty
chief
it
was
through
signy
the
daughter
of
the
house
that
a
feud
and
a
deadly
battle
was
brought
to
volsung
and
his
sons
she
was
a
wise
and
a
fair
maiden
and
her
fame
went
through
all
the
lands
now
one
day
volsung
received
a
message
from
a
king
asking
for
the
hand
of
signy
in
marriage
and
volsung
who
knew
of
this
king
through
report
of
his
battles
sent
a
message
to
him
saying
that
he
would
be
welcome
to
the
hall
of
the
branstock
so
king
siggeir
came
with
his
men
but
when
the
volsungs
looked
into
his
face
they
liked
it
not
and
signy
shrank
away
saying
this
king
is
evil
of
heart
and
false
of
word
volsung
and
his
eleven
sons
took
counsel
together
siggeir
had
a
great
force
of
men
with
him
and
if
they
refused
to
give
her
he
could
slay
them
all
and
harry
their
kingdom
besides
they
had
pledged
themselves
to
give
signy
when
they
had
sent
him
a
message
of
welcome
long
counsel
they
had
together
and
ten
of
signy
brothers
said
let
signy
wed
this
king
he
is
not
as
evil
as
he
seems
in
her
mind
ten
brothers
said
it
but
one
spoke
out
saying
we
will
not
give
our
sister
to
this
evil
king
rather
let
us
all
go
down
fighting
with
the
hall
of
the
branstock
flaming
above
our
heads
it
was
sigmund
the
youngest
of
the
volsungs
who
said
this
but
signy
father
said
we
know
nought
of
evil
of
king
siggeir
also
our
word
is
given
to
him
let
him
feast
with
us
this
night
in
the
hall
of
the
branstock
and
let
signy
go
from
us
with
him
as
his
wife
then
they
looked
to
her
and
they
saw
signy
face
and
it
was
white
and
stern
let
it
be
as
ye
have
said
my
father
and
my
brothers
she
said
i
will
wed
king
siggeir
and
go
with
him
overseas
so
she
said
aloud
but
sigmund
heard
her
say
to
herself
it
is
woe
for
the
volsungs
a
feast
was
made
and
king
siggeir
and
his
men
came
to
the
hall
of
the
branstock
fires
were
lighted
and
tables
were
spread
and
great
horns
of
mead
went
around
the
guests
in
the
middle
of
the
feasting
a
stranger
entered
the
hall
he
was
taller
than
the
tallest
there
and
his
bearing
made
all
do
him
reverence
one
offered
him
a
horn
of
mead
and
he
drank
it
then
from
under
the
blue
cloak
that
he
wore
he
drew
a
sword
that
made
the
brightness
of
the
hall
more
bright
he
went
to
the
tree
that
the
hall
was
built
around
to
the
branstock
and
he
thrust
the
sword
into
it
all
the
company
were
hushed
then
they
heard
the
voice
of
the
stranger
a
voice
that
was
like
the
call
the
sword
is
for
the
hand
that
can
draw
it
out
of
the
branstock
then
he
went
out
of
the
hall
all
looked
to
where
the
sword
was
placed
and
saw
a
hand
breadth
of
wonderful
brightness
this
one
and
that
one
would
have
laid
hands
on
the
hilt
only
volsung
voice
bade
them
stand
still
it
is
meet
he
said
that
our
guest
and
our
king
siggeir
should
be
the
first
to
put
hands
on
its
hilt
and
try
to
draw
the
sword
of
the
stranger
out
of
the
branstock
king
siggeir
went
to
the
tree
and
laid
his
hands
on
the
broad
hilt
he
strove
hard
to
draw
out
the
sword
but
all
his
might
could
not
move
it
as
he
strained
himself
to
draw
it
and
failed
a
dark
look
of
anger
came
into
his
face
then
others
tried
to
draw
it
the
captains
who
were
with
king
siggeir
and
they
too
failed
to
move
the
blade
then
volsung
tried
and
volsung
could
not
move
it
one
after
the
other
his
eleven
sons
strained
to
draw
out
the
stranger
sword
at
last
it
came
to
the
turn
of
the
youngest
to
sigmund
to
try
and
when
sigmund
laid
his
hand
on
the
broad
hilt
and
drew
it
behold
the
sword
came
with
his
hand
and
once
again
the
hall
was
brightened
with
its
marvelous
brightness
it
was
a
wondrous
sword
a
sword
made
out
of
better
metal
and
by
smiths
more
cunning
than
any
known
all
envied
sigmund
that
he
had
won
for
himself
that
king
siggeir
looked
on
it
with
greedy
eyes
i
will
give
thee
its
weight
in
gold
for
that
sword
good
brother
he
said
but
sigmund
said
to
him
proudly
if
the
sword
was
for
thy
hand
thou
shouldst
have
won
it
the
sword
was
not
for
thine
but
for
a
hand
and
signy
looking
at
king
siggeir
saw
a
look
of
deeper
evil
come
into
his
face
she
knew
that
hatred
for
all
the
volsung
race
was
in
his
heart
but
at
the
end
of
the
feast
she
was
wed
to
king
siggeir
and
the
next
day
she
left
the
hall
of
the
branstock
and
went
with
him
down
to
where
his
great
painted
ship
was
drawn
up
on
the
beach
and
when
they
were
parting
from
her
her
father
and
her
brothers
king
siggeir
invited
them
to
come
to
his
country
as
friends
visiting
friends
and
kinsmen
visiting
kinsmen
and
look
on
signy
again
and
he
stood
on
the
beach
and
would
not
go
on
board
his
ship
until
each
and
all
of
the
volsungs
gave
their
word
that
they
would
visit
signy
and
him
in
his
own
land
and
when
thou
comest
he
said
to
sigmund
be
sure
thou
dost
bring
with
thee
the
mighty
sword
that
thou
didst
win
all
this
was
thought
of
by
sigurd
the
son
of
sigmund
as
he
rode
toward
the
fringe
of
the
forest
the
time
came
for
volsung
and
his
sons
to
redeem
the
promise
they
made
to
king
siggeir
they
made
ready
their
ship
and
they
sailed
from
the
land
where
stood
the
hall
of
the
branstock
and
they
landed
on
the
coast
of
king
siggeir
country
and
they
drew
their
ship
up
on
the
beach
and
they
made
their
camp
there
intending
to
come
to
the
king
hall
in
the
broad
light
of
the
day
but
in
the
half
light
of
the
dawn
one
came
to
the
volsung
ship
a
cloak
and
hood
covered
the
figure
but
sigmund
who
was
the
watcher
knew
who
it
was
signy
he
said
and
signy
asked
that
her
father
and
her
brothers
be
awakened
until
she
would
speak
to
them
of
a
treason
that
was
brewed
against
them
king
siggeir
has
made
ready
a
great
army
against
your
coming
she
told
them
he
hates
the
volsungs
the
branch
as
well
as
the
root
and
it
is
his
plan
to
fall
upon
you
my
father
and
my
brothers
with
his
great
army
and
slay
you
all
and
he
would
possess
himself
of
gram
therefore
i
say
to
you
o
volsungs
draw
your
ship
into
the
sea
and
sail
from
the
land
where
such
treachery
can
be
but
volsung
her
father
would
not
listen
the
volsungs
do
not
depart
like
broken
men
from
a
land
they
have
brought
their
ship
to
he
said
we
gave
each
and
all
the
word
that
we
would
visit
king
siggeir
and
visit
him
we
will
and
if
he
is
a
dastard
and
would
fall
upon
us
why
we
are
the
unbeaten
volsungs
and
we
will
fight
against
him
and
his
army
and
slay
him
and
bear
you
back
with
us
to
the
hall
of
the
branstock
the
day
widens
now
and
we
shall
go
to
the
hall
signy
would
have
spoken
of
the
great
army
king
siggeir
had
gathered
but
she
knew
that
the
volsungs
never
harkened
to
talk
of
odds
she
spoke
no
more
but
bowed
her
head
and
went
back
to
king
siggeir
hall
siggeir
knew
that
signy
had
been
to
warn
her
father
and
her
brothers
he
called
the
men
he
had
gathered
and
he
posted
them
cunningly
in
the
way
the
volsungs
would
come
then
he
sent
one
to
the
ship
with
a
message
of
welcome
as
they
left
their
ship
the
army
of
king
siggeir
fell
upon
the
volsungs
and
their
followers
very
fierce
was
the
battle
that
was
waged
on
the
beach
and
many
and
many
a
one
of
king
siggeir
fierce
fighters
went
down
before
the
fearless
ones
that
made
volsung
company
but
at
last
volsung
himself
was
slain
and
his
eleven
sons
were
taken
captive
and
gram
his
mighty
sword
was
taken
out
of
sigmund
hands
they
were
brought
before
king
siggeir
in
his
hall
the
eleven
volsung
princes
siggeir
laughed
to
see
them
before
him
ye
are
not
in
the
hall
of
the
branstock
now
to
dishonor
me
with
black
looks
and
scornful
words
he
said
and
a
harder
task
will
be
given
you
than
that
of
drawing
a
sword
out
of
a
before
set
of
sun
i
will
see
you
hewn
to
pieces
with
the
sword
then
signy
who
was
there
stood
up
with
her
white
face
and
her
wide
eyes
and
she
said
i
pray
not
for
longer
life
for
my
brothers
for
well
i
know
that
my
prayers
would
avail
them
nought
but
dost
thou
not
heed
the
proverb
siggeir
to
the
eye
as
long
as
the
eye
can
see
and
siggeir
laughed
his
evil
laugh
when
he
heard
her
aye
my
queen
he
said
sweet
to
the
eye
as
long
as
the
eye
may
see
their
torments
they
shall
not
die
at
once
nor
all
together
i
will
let
them
see
each
other
die
so
siggeir
gave
a
new
order
to
his
dastard
troops
the
order
was
that
the
eleven
brothers
should
be
taken
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
and
chained
to
great
beams
and
left
there
this
was
done
with
the
eleven
sons
of
volsung
the
next
day
one
who
had
watched
and
who
was
faithful
to
signy
came
and
signy
said
to
him
what
has
befallen
my
brothers
and
the
watcher
said
a
great
wolf
came
to
where
the
chained
men
are
and
fell
upon
the
first
of
them
and
devoured
him
when
signy
heard
this
no
tears
came
from
her
eyes
but
that
which
was
hard
around
her
heart
became
harder
she
said
go
again
and
watch
what
befalls
and
the
watcher
came
the
second
time
and
said
the
second
of
your
brothers
has
been
devoured
by
the
wolf
signy
shed
no
tears
this
time
either
and
again
that
which
was
hard
around
her
heart
became
harder
and
every
day
the
watcher
came
and
he
told
her
what
had
befallen
her
brothers
and
it
came
to
the
time
when
but
one
of
her
brothers
was
left
alive
sigmund
the
youngest
then
said
signy
not
without
device
are
we
left
at
the
end
i
have
thought
of
what
is
to
be
done
take
a
pot
of
honey
to
where
he
is
chained
and
smear
sigmund
face
with
the
honey
the
watcher
did
as
signy
bade
him
again
the
great
wolf
came
along
the
to
where
sigmund
was
chained
when
she
snuffed
over
him
she
found
the
honey
upon
his
face
she
put
down
her
tongue
to
lick
over
his
face
then
with
his
strong
teeth
sigmund
seized
the
tongue
of
the
wolf
she
fought
and
she
struggled
with
all
her
might
but
sigmund
did
not
let
go
of
her
tongue
the
struggle
with
the
beast
broke
the
beam
to
which
he
was
chained
then
sigmund
seized
the
wolf
with
his
hands
and
tore
her
jaws
apart
the
watcher
saw
this
happening
and
told
of
it
to
signy
a
fierce
joy
went
through
her
and
she
said
one
of
the
volsungs
lives
and
vengeance
will
be
wrought
upon
king
siggeir
and
upon
his
house
still
the
watcher
stayed
in
the
ways
of
the
forest
and
he
marked
where
sigmund
built
for
himself
a
hidden
hut
often
he
bore
tokens
from
signy
to
sigmund
sigmund
took
to
the
ways
of
the
hunter
and
the
outlaw
but
he
did
not
forsake
the
forest
and
king
siggeir
knew
not
that
one
of
the
volsungs
lived
and
was
near
him
illustration
the
story
of
sigmund
and
sinfiotli
as
sigurd
rode
the
ways
of
the
forest
he
thought
upon
sigmund
his
father
on
his
life
and
his
death
according
to
what
hiordis
his
mother
had
told
him
sigmund
lived
for
long
the
life
of
the
hunter
and
the
outlaw
but
he
never
strayed
far
from
the
forest
that
was
in
king
siggeir
dominion
often
did
he
get
a
token
from
signy
they
two
the
last
of
the
volsungs
knew
that
king
siggeir
and
his
house
would
have
to
perish
for
the
treason
he
had
wrought
on
their
father
and
their
brothers
sigmund
knew
that
his
sister
would
send
her
son
to
help
him
one
morning
there
came
to
his
hut
a
boy
of
ten
years
he
knew
that
this
was
one
of
signy
sons
and
that
she
would
have
him
train
him
into
being
a
warrior
worthy
of
the
volsung
breed
sigmund
hardly
looked
and
hardly
spoke
to
the
lad
he
was
going
hunting
and
as
he
took
down
his
spear
from
the
wall
he
said
there
is
the
mealbag
boy
mix
the
meal
and
make
the
bread
and
we
will
eat
when
i
come
back
when
he
returned
the
bread
was
unmade
and
the
boy
was
standing
watching
the
mealbag
with
widened
eyes
thou
didst
not
make
the
bread
sigmund
said
nay
said
the
boy
i
was
afeard
to
go
near
the
bag
something
stirred
within
it
thou
hast
the
heart
of
a
mouse
so
to
be
frighted
go
back
to
thy
mother
and
tell
her
that
not
in
thee
is
the
stuff
for
a
volsung
warrior
so
sigmund
spoke
and
the
boy
went
away
weeping
a
year
later
another
son
of
signy
came
as
before
sigmund
hardly
looked
at
and
hardly
spoke
to
the
boy
he
said
there
is
the
mealbag
mix
the
meal
and
make
ready
the
bread
against
the
time
i
return
when
sigmund
came
back
the
bread
was
unmade
the
boy
had
shrunk
away
from
where
the
bag
was
thou
hast
not
made
the
bread
sigmund
said
nay
said
the
boy
something
stirred
in
the
bag
and
i
was
afeard
thou
hast
the
heart
of
a
mouse
get
thee
back
to
thy
mother
and
tell
her
that
there
is
not
in
thee
the
stuff
for
the
making
of
a
volsung
warrior
and
this
boy
like
his
brother
went
back
weeping
at
that
time
signy
had
no
other
sons
but
at
last
one
was
born
to
her
the
child
of
a
desperate
thought
him
too
when
he
was
grown
she
sent
to
sigmund
what
did
thy
mother
say
to
thee
sigmund
said
to
this
boy
when
he
showed
himself
at
the
hut
nothing
she
sewed
my
gloves
to
my
hands
and
then
bade
me
pull
them
off
and
didst
thou
aye
and
the
skin
came
with
them
and
didst
thou
weep
a
volsung
does
not
weep
for
such
a
thing
long
did
sigmund
look
on
the
lad
he
was
tall
and
fair
and
and
his
eyes
had
no
fear
in
them
what
wouldst
thou
have
me
do
for
thee
said
the
lad
there
is
the
mealbag
sigmund
said
mix
the
meal
and
make
the
bread
for
me
against
the
time
i
return
when
sigmund
came
back
the
bread
was
baking
on
the
coals
what
didst
thou
with
the
meal
sigmund
asked
i
mixed
it
something
was
in
the
meal
a
serpent
i
think
but
i
kneaded
it
with
the
meal
and
now
the
serpent
is
baking
on
the
coals
sigmund
laughed
and
threw
his
arms
around
the
boy
thou
wilt
not
eat
of
that
bread
he
said
thou
didst
knead
into
it
a
venomous
serpent
the
boy
name
was
sinfiotli
sigmund
trained
him
in
the
ways
of
the
hunter
and
the
outlaw
here
and
there
they
went
taking
vengeance
on
king
siggeir
men
the
boy
was
fierce
but
never
did
he
speak
a
word
that
was
false
one
day
when
sigmund
and
sinfiotli
were
hunting
they
came
upon
a
strange
house
in
the
dark
wood
when
they
went
within
they
found
two
men
lying
there
sleeping
a
deep
sleep
on
their
arms
were
heavy
rings
of
gold
and
sigmund
knew
that
they
were
the
sons
of
kings
and
beside
the
sleeping
men
he
saw
wolfskins
left
there
as
though
they
had
been
cast
off
then
sigmund
knew
that
these
men
were
that
they
were
ones
who
changed
their
shapes
and
ranged
through
the
forests
as
wolves
sigmund
and
sinfiotli
put
on
the
skins
that
the
men
had
cast
off
and
when
they
did
this
they
changed
their
shapes
and
became
as
wolves
and
as
wolves
they
ranged
through
the
forest
now
and
then
changing
their
shapes
back
to
those
of
men
as
wolves
they
fell
upon
king
siggeir
men
and
slew
more
and
more
of
them
one
day
sigmund
said
to
sinfiotli
thou
art
still
young
and
i
would
not
have
thee
be
too
rash
if
thou
dost
come
upon
a
company
of
seven
men
fight
them
but
if
thou
dost
come
on
a
company
greater
than
seven
raise
up
thy
voice
as
a
wolf
cry
and
bring
me
to
thy
side
sinfiotli
promised
that
he
would
do
this
one
day
as
he
went
through
the
forest
in
his
wolf
shape
sigmund
heard
the
din
of
a
struggle
and
he
stopped
to
listen
for
call
but
no
call
came
then
sigmund
went
through
the
forest
in
the
direction
of
the
struggle
on
his
way
he
passed
the
bodies
of
eleven
slain
men
and
he
came
upon
sinfiotli
lying
in
the
thicket
his
shape
upon
him
and
panting
from
the
battle
he
had
waged
thou
didst
strive
with
eleven
men
why
didst
thou
not
call
to
me
sigmund
said
why
should
i
have
called
to
thee
i
am
not
so
feeble
but
i
can
strive
with
eleven
men
sigmund
was
made
angry
with
this
answer
he
looked
on
sinfiotli
where
he
lay
and
the
wicked
wolf
nature
that
was
in
the
skin
came
over
him
he
sprang
upon
him
sinking
his
teeth
in
sinfiotli
throat
sinfiotli
lay
gasping
in
the
throes
of
death
and
sigmund
knowing
the
deadly
grip
that
was
in
those
jaws
of
his
howled
his
anguish
then
as
he
licked
the
face
of
his
comrade
he
saw
two
weasels
meet
they
began
to
fight
one
with
the
other
and
the
first
caught
the
second
at
the
throat
and
bit
him
with
his
teeth
and
laid
him
out
as
if
in
death
sigmund
marked
the
combat
and
the
end
of
it
but
then
the
first
weasel
ran
and
found
leaves
of
a
certain
herb
and
he
put
them
upon
his
comrade
wound
and
the
herb
cured
the
wound
and
the
weasel
that
was
bitten
rose
up
and
was
sound
and
swift
again
sigmund
went
searching
for
the
herb
he
saw
the
weasel
carry
to
his
comrade
and
as
he
sought
for
it
he
saw
a
raven
with
a
leaf
in
her
beak
she
dropped
the
leaf
as
he
came
to
her
and
behold
it
was
the
same
leaf
as
the
weasel
had
brought
to
his
comrade
sigmund
took
it
and
laid
it
on
the
wound
he
had
made
in
sinfiotli
throat
and
the
wound
healed
and
sinfiotli
was
sound
once
more
they
went
back
to
their
hut
in
the
forest
and
the
next
day
they
burnt
the
wolfskins
and
they
prayed
the
gods
that
they
might
never
be
afflicted
with
the
wolf
evil
nature
again
and
sigmund
and
sinfiotli
never
afterwards
changed
their
shapes
illustration
the
story
of
the
vengeance
of
the
volsungs
and
of
the
death
of
sinfiotli
and
now
sinfiotli
had
come
to
his
full
strength
and
it
was
time
to
take
vengeance
on
king
siggeir
for
the
slaying
of
volsung
and
the
dread
doom
he
had
set
for
volsung
ten
sons
sigmund
and
sinfiotli
put
helmets
on
their
heads
and
took
swords
in
their
hands
and
went
to
king
hall
they
hid
behind
the
casks
of
ale
that
were
at
the
entrance
and
they
waited
for
the
to
leave
the
hall
that
they
might
fall
upon
king
siggeir
and
his
attendants
the
younger
children
of
king
siggeir
were
playing
in
the
hall
and
one
let
fall
a
ball
it
went
rolling
behind
the
casks
of
ale
and
the
child
peering
after
the
ball
saw
two
men
crouching
with
swords
in
their
hands
and
helmets
on
their
heads
the
child
told
a
servant
who
told
the
king
then
siggeir
arose
and
he
drew
his
around
him
and
he
set
them
on
the
men
who
were
hiding
behind
the
barrels
sigmund
and
sinfiotli
sprang
up
and
fought
against
the
men
of
king
siggeir
but
they
were
taken
captives
now
they
might
not
be
slain
there
and
then
for
it
was
unlawful
to
slay
captives
after
sunset
but
for
all
that
king
siggeir
would
not
leave
them
above
ground
he
decreed
that
they
should
be
put
in
a
pit
and
a
mound
made
over
them
so
that
they
would
be
buried
alive
the
sentence
was
carried
out
a
great
flagstone
was
put
down
to
divide
the
pit
in
two
so
that
sigmund
and
sinfiotli
might
hear
each
struggle
and
not
be
able
to
give
help
to
each
other
all
was
done
as
the
king
commanded
but
while
his
thralls
were
putting
sods
over
the
pit
one
came
amongst
them
cloaked
and
hooded
and
dropped
something
wrapped
in
straw
into
the
side
of
the
pit
where
sinfiotli
lay
and
when
the
sky
was
shut
out
from
them
with
the
turf
and
soil
that
was
put
over
the
pit
sinfiotli
shouted
to
sigmund
i
shall
not
die
for
the
queen
has
thrown
down
to
me
meat
wrapped
in
a
parcel
of
straw
and
a
while
afterwards
sinfiotli
shouted
to
sigmund
the
queen
has
left
a
sword
in
the
meat
which
she
flung
down
to
me
it
is
a
mighty
sword
almost
i
think
it
is
gram
the
sword
you
told
me
of
if
it
be
gram
sigmund
said
it
is
a
sword
that
can
cut
through
this
flagstone
thrust
the
blade
against
the
stone
and
try
sinfiotli
thrust
the
blade
against
the
stone
and
the
blade
went
through
the
stone
then
one
on
each
side
they
took
hold
of
the
sword
and
they
cut
the
great
stone
in
two
afterwards
working
together
it
was
easy
to
shift
the
turf
and
soil
the
two
came
out
under
the
sky
before
them
was
the
hall
of
king
siggeir
they
came
to
the
hall
and
they
set
dry
wood
before
it
and
they
fired
the
wood
and
made
the
hall
blaze
up
and
when
the
hall
was
in
a
blaze
king
siggeir
came
to
the
door
and
shouted
who
is
it
that
has
fired
the
house
of
the
king
and
sigmund
said
i
sigmund
the
son
of
volsung
that
you
may
pay
for
the
treason
wrought
on
the
volsungs
seeing
sigmund
there
with
gram
the
great
sword
in
his
hands
siggeir
went
back
into
his
hall
then
signy
was
seen
with
her
white
face
and
her
stern
eyes
and
sigmund
called
to
her
come
forth
come
forth
sigmund
calls
come
out
of
siggeir
blazing
house
and
together
we
will
go
back
to
the
hall
of
the
branstock
but
signy
said
all
is
finished
now
the
vengeance
is
wrought
and
i
have
no
more
to
keep
me
in
life
the
volsung
race
lives
on
in
you
my
brother
and
that
is
my
joy
not
merrily
did
i
wed
king
siggeir
and
not
merrily
did
i
live
with
him
but
merrily
will
i
die
with
him
now
she
went
within
the
hall
then
the
flames
burst
over
it
and
all
who
were
within
perished
thus
the
vengeance
of
the
volsungs
was
wrought
and
sigurd
thought
on
the
deed
that
sigmund
his
father
and
sinfiotli
the
youth
who
was
his
father
kinsman
wrought
as
he
rode
the
ways
of
the
forest
and
of
the
things
that
thereafter
befell
them
sigmund
and
sinfiotli
left
king
siggeir
land
and
came
back
to
the
land
where
was
the
hall
of
the
branstock
sigmund
became
a
great
king
and
sinfiotli
was
the
captain
of
his
host
and
the
story
of
sigmund
and
sinfiotli
goes
on
to
tell
how
sigmund
wed
a
woman
whose
name
was
borghild
and
how
sinfiotli
loved
a
woman
who
was
loved
by
borghild
brother
a
battle
came
in
which
the
youths
were
on
opposite
sides
and
sinfiotli
killed
borghild
brother
and
it
was
in
fair
combat
sinfiotli
returned
home
to
make
peace
between
him
and
the
queen
sigmund
gave
borghild
a
great
measure
of
gold
as
compensation
for
the
loss
of
her
brother
the
queen
took
it
and
said
lo
my
brother
worth
is
reckoned
at
this
let
no
more
be
said
about
his
slaying
and
she
made
sinfiotli
welcome
to
the
hall
of
the
branstock
but
although
she
showed
herself
friendly
to
him
her
heart
was
set
upon
his
destruction
that
night
there
was
a
feast
in
the
hall
of
the
branstock
and
borghild
the
queen
went
to
all
the
guests
with
a
horn
of
mead
in
her
hand
she
came
to
sinfiotli
and
she
held
the
horn
to
him
take
this
from
my
hands
o
friend
of
sigmund
she
said
but
sinfiotli
saw
what
was
in
her
eyes
and
he
said
i
will
not
drink
from
this
horn
there
is
venom
in
the
drink
then
to
end
the
mockery
that
the
queen
would
have
made
over
sinfiotli
sigmund
who
was
standing
by
took
the
horn
out
of
borghild
hand
no
venom
or
poison
could
injure
him
he
raised
the
horn
to
his
lips
and
drained
the
mead
at
a
draught
the
queen
said
to
sinfiotli
must
other
men
quaff
thy
drink
for
thee
later
in
the
night
she
came
to
him
again
the
horn
of
mead
in
her
hand
she
offered
it
to
sinfiotli
but
he
looked
in
her
eyes
and
saw
the
hatred
that
was
there
venom
is
in
the
drink
he
said
i
will
not
take
it
and
again
sigmund
took
the
horn
and
drank
the
mead
at
a
draught
and
again
the
queen
mocked
sinfiotli
a
third
time
she
came
to
him
before
she
offered
the
horn
she
said
this
is
the
one
who
fears
to
take
his
drink
like
a
man
what
a
volsung
heart
he
has
sinfiotli
saw
the
hatred
in
her
eyes
and
her
mockery
could
not
make
him
take
the
mead
from
her
as
before
sigmund
was
standing
by
but
now
he
was
weary
of
raising
the
horn
and
he
said
to
sinfiotli
pour
the
drink
through
thy
beard
he
thought
that
sigmund
meant
that
he
should
pour
the
mead
through
his
lips
that
were
bearded
and
make
trouble
no
more
between
him
and
the
queen
but
sigmund
did
not
mean
that
he
meant
that
he
should
pretend
to
drink
and
let
the
mead
run
down
on
the
floor
sinfiotli
not
understanding
what
his
comrade
meant
took
the
horn
from
the
queen
and
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
drank
and
as
soon
as
he
drank
the
venom
that
was
in
the
drink
went
to
his
heart
and
he
fell
dead
in
the
hall
of
the
branstock
oh
woeful
was
sigmund
for
the
death
of
his
kinsman
and
his
comrade
he
would
let
no
one
touch
his
body
he
himself
lifted
sinfiotli
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
out
of
the
hall
and
through
the
wood
and
down
to
the
seashore
and
when
he
came
to
the
shore
he
saw
a
boat
drawn
up
with
a
man
therein
sigmund
came
near
to
him
and
saw
that
the
man
was
old
and
strangely
tall
i
will
take
thy
burthen
from
thee
the
man
said
sigmund
left
the
body
of
sinfiotli
in
the
boat
thinking
to
take
a
place
beside
it
but
as
soon
as
the
body
was
placed
in
it
the
boat
went
from
the
land
without
sail
or
oars
sigmund
looking
on
the
old
man
who
stood
at
the
stern
knew
that
he
was
not
of
mortal
men
but
was
odin
the
giver
of
the
sword
gram
then
sigmund
went
back
to
his
hall
his
queen
died
and
in
time
he
wed
with
hiordis
who
became
the
mother
of
sigurd
and
now
sigurd
the
volsung
the
son
of
sigmund
and
hiordis
rode
the
ways
of
the
forest
the
sword
gram
by
his
side
and
the
golden
helmet
of
the
dragon
hoard
above
his
golden
hair
illustration
brynhild
in
the
house
of
flame
the
forest
ways
led
him
on
and
up
a
he
came
to
a
at
last
hindfell
where
the
trees
fell
away
leaving
a
place
open
to
the
sky
and
the
winds
on
hindfell
was
the
house
of
flame
sigurd
saw
the
walls
black
and
high
and
all
around
them
was
a
ring
of
fire
as
he
rode
nearer
he
heard
the
roar
of
the
mounting
and
the
circling
fire
he
sat
on
grani
his
proud
horse
and
for
long
he
looked
on
the
black
walls
and
the
flame
that
went
circling
around
them
then
he
rode
grani
to
the
fire
another
horse
would
have
been
affrighted
but
grani
remained
steady
under
sigurd
to
the
wall
of
fire
they
came
and
sigurd
who
knew
no
fear
rode
through
it
now
he
was
in
the
courtyard
of
the
hall
no
stir
was
there
of
man
or
hound
or
horse
sigurd
dismounted
and
bade
grani
be
still
he
opened
a
door
and
he
saw
a
chamber
with
hangings
on
which
was
wrought
the
pattern
of
a
great
tree
a
tree
with
three
roots
and
the
pattern
was
carried
across
from
one
wall
to
the
other
on
a
couch
in
the
center
of
the
chamber
one
lay
in
slumber
upon
the
head
was
a
helmet
and
across
the
breast
was
a
breastplate
sigurd
took
the
helmet
off
the
head
then
over
the
couch
fell
a
heap
of
woman
hair
wondrous
hair
this
was
the
maiden
that
the
birds
had
told
him
of
he
cut
the
fastenings
of
the
breastplate
with
his
sword
and
he
gazed
long
upon
her
beautiful
was
her
face
but
stern
like
the
face
of
one
who
subdues
but
may
not
be
subdued
beautiful
and
strong
were
her
arms
and
her
hands
her
mouth
was
proud
and
over
her
closed
eyes
there
were
strong
and
beautiful
brows
her
eyes
opened
and
she
turned
them
and
looked
full
upon
sigurd
who
art
thou
who
hast
awakened
me
she
said
i
am
sigurd
the
son
of
sigmund
of
the
volsung
race
he
answered
and
thou
didst
ride
through
the
ring
of
fire
to
me
that
did
i
she
knelt
on
the
couch
and
stretched
out
her
arms
to
where
the
light
shone
hail
o
day
she
cried
and
hail
o
beams
that
are
the
sons
of
day
o
night
and
o
daughter
of
night
may
ye
look
on
us
with
eyes
that
bless
hail
o
æsir
and
o
asyniur
hail
o
fields
of
midgard
may
ye
give
us
wisdom
and
wise
speech
and
healing
power
and
grant
that
nothing
untrue
or
unbrave
may
come
near
us
all
this
she
cried
with
eyes
open
wide
they
were
eyes
that
had
in
them
all
the
blue
that
sigurd
had
ever
seen
the
blue
of
flowers
the
blue
of
skies
the
blue
of
she
turned
those
great
eyes
upon
him
and
she
said
i
am
brynhild
once
a
valkyrie
but
now
a
mortal
maiden
one
who
will
know
death
and
all
the
sorrows
that
mortal
women
know
but
there
are
things
that
i
may
not
know
things
that
are
false
and
of
no
bravery
she
was
the
bravest
and
the
wisest
and
the
most
beautiful
maiden
in
the
world
sigurd
knew
that
it
was
so
he
laid
his
sword
gram
at
her
feet
and
he
said
her
name
brynhild
he
told
her
how
he
had
slain
the
dragon
and
how
he
had
heard
the
birds
tell
of
her
she
rose
from
the
couch
and
bound
her
wondrous
hair
on
her
head
in
wonder
he
watched
her
when
she
moved
it
was
as
though
she
walked
above
the
earth
they
sat
together
and
she
told
him
wonderful
and
secret
things
and
she
told
him
too
how
she
was
sent
by
odin
from
asgard
to
choose
the
slain
for
his
hall
valhalla
and
to
give
victory
to
those
whom
he
willed
to
have
it
and
she
told
how
she
had
disobeyed
the
will
of
and
how
for
that
she
was
made
outcast
of
asgard
odin
put
into
her
flesh
the
thorn
of
the
tree
of
sleep
that
she
might
remain
in
slumber
until
one
who
was
the
bravest
of
mortal
men
should
waken
her
whoever
would
break
the
fastenings
of
the
breastplate
would
take
out
the
thorn
of
sleep
odin
granted
me
this
she
said
that
as
a
mortal
maid
i
should
wed
none
but
him
who
is
the
bravest
in
the
world
and
so
that
none
but
him
might
come
to
me
put
the
round
where
i
lay
in
slumber
and
it
is
thou
sigurd
son
of
sigmund
who
hast
come
to
me
thou
art
the
bravest
and
i
think
thou
art
the
most
beautiful
too
like
to
tyr
the
god
who
wields
the
sword
she
told
him
that
whoever
rode
through
the
fire
and
claimed
her
as
his
wife
him
she
must
wed
they
talked
to
each
other
fondly
and
the
day
flowed
by
them
then
sigurd
heard
grani
his
horse
neigh
for
him
again
and
again
he
cried
to
brynhild
let
me
go
from
the
gaze
of
thine
eyes
i
am
that
one
who
is
to
have
the
greatest
name
in
the
world
not
yet
have
i
made
my
name
as
great
as
my
father
and
my
father
father
made
their
names
great
i
have
overcome
king
lygni
and
i
have
slain
fafnir
the
dragon
but
that
is
little
i
would
make
my
name
the
greatest
in
the
world
and
endure
all
that
is
to
be
endured
in
making
it
so
then
i
would
come
back
to
thee
in
the
house
of
flame
brynhild
said
to
him
well
dost
thou
speak
make
thy
name
great
and
endure
what
thou
hast
to
endure
in
making
it
so
i
will
wait
for
thee
knowing
that
none
but
sigurd
will
be
able
to
win
through
the
fire
that
guards
where
i
abide
they
gazed
long
on
each
other
but
little
more
they
spoke
then
they
held
each
other
hands
in
farewell
and
they
plighted
faith
promising
each
other
that
they
would
take
no
other
man
or
maiden
for
their
mate
and
for
token
of
their
troth
sigurd
took
the
ring
that
was
on
his
finger
and
placed
it
on
brynhild
andvari
ring
it
was
illustration
sigurd
at
the
house
of
the
nibelungs
he
left
hindfell
and
he
came
into
a
kingdom
that
was
ruled
over
by
a
people
that
were
called
the
nibelungs
as
sigurd
people
were
called
the
volsungs
giuki
was
the
name
of
the
king
of
that
land
giuki
and
his
queen
and
all
their
sons
gave
a
great
welcome
to
sigurd
when
he
came
to
their
hall
for
he
looked
such
a
one
as
might
win
the
name
of
being
the
world
greatest
hero
and
sigurd
went
to
war
beside
the
king
sons
gunnar
and
högni
and
the
three
made
great
names
for
themselves
but
sigurd
shone
high
above
the
others
when
they
came
back
from
that
war
there
were
great
rejoicings
in
the
hall
of
the
nibelungs
and
sigurd
heart
was
filled
with
friendship
for
all
the
nibelung
race
he
had
love
for
the
king
sons
gunnar
and
högni
and
with
gunnar
and
högni
he
swore
oaths
of
brotherhood
henceforward
he
and
they
would
be
as
brethren
king
giuki
had
a
stepson
named
guttorm
and
he
was
not
bound
in
the
oath
that
bound
sigurd
and
the
others
in
brotherhood
after
the
war
they
had
waged
sigurd
spent
a
whole
winter
in
the
hall
of
the
nibelungs
his
heart
was
full
of
memories
of
brynhild
and
of
longings
to
ride
to
her
in
the
house
of
flame
and
to
take
her
with
him
to
the
kingdom
that
king
giuki
would
have
given
him
but
as
yet
he
would
not
go
back
to
her
for
he
had
sworn
to
give
his
brethren
further
help
one
day
as
he
rode
by
himself
he
heard
birds
talk
to
each
other
and
he
knew
the
words
they
were
saying
one
said
there
is
sigurd
who
wears
the
wondrous
helmet
that
he
took
out
of
fafnir
hoard
and
the
other
bird
said
he
knows
not
that
by
that
helmet
he
can
change
his
shape
as
fafnir
changed
his
shape
and
make
him
look
like
this
creature
or
that
creature
or
this
man
or
that
man
and
the
third
bird
said
he
knows
not
that
the
helmet
can
do
anything
so
wonderful
for
him
he
rode
back
to
the
hall
of
the
nibelungs
and
at
the
supperboard
he
told
them
what
he
had
heard
the
birds
say
he
showed
them
the
wondrous
helmet
also
he
told
them
how
he
had
slain
fafnir
the
dragon
and
of
how
he
had
won
the
mighty
hoard
for
himself
his
two
sworn
brothers
who
were
there
rejoiced
that
he
had
such
wondrous
possessions
but
more
precious
than
the
hoard
and
more
wondrous
than
the
helmet
was
the
memory
of
brynhild
that
he
had
but
of
this
he
said
no
word
grimhild
was
the
name
of
the
queen
she
was
the
mother
of
gunnar
and
högni
and
their
guttorm
and
she
and
the
king
had
one
daughter
whose
name
was
gudrun
now
grimhild
was
one
of
the
wisest
of
women
and
she
knew
when
she
looked
upon
him
that
sigurd
was
the
greatest
warrior
she
would
have
him
belong
to
the
nibelungs
not
only
by
the
oaths
of
brotherhood
he
had
sworn
with
gunnar
and
högni
but
by
other
ties
and
when
she
heard
of
the
great
hoard
that
was
his
she
had
greater
wish
and
will
that
he
should
be
one
with
the
nibelungs
she
looked
on
the
helmet
of
gold
and
on
the
great
armring
that
he
wore
and
she
made
it
her
heart
purpose
that
sigurd
should
wed
with
gudrun
her
daughter
but
neither
sigurd
nor
the
maiden
gudrun
knew
of
resolve
and
the
queen
watching
sigurd
closely
knew
that
he
had
a
remembrance
in
his
breast
that
held
him
from
seeing
gudrun
loveliness
she
had
knowledge
of
spells
and
secret
brews
she
was
of
the
race
of
borghild
whose
brew
had
destroyed
sinfiotli
life
and
she
knew
that
she
could
make
a
potion
that
would
destroy
the
memory
sigurd
held
she
mixed
the
potion
then
one
night
when
there
was
feasting
in
the
hall
of
the
nibelungs
she
gave
the
cup
that
held
the
potion
into
the
hands
of
gudrun
and
bade
her
carry
it
to
sigurd
sigurd
took
the
cup
out
of
the
hands
of
the
fair
nibelung
maiden
and
he
drank
the
potion
when
he
had
drunk
it
he
put
the
cup
down
and
he
stood
amongst
the
feasters
like
a
man
in
a
dream
and
like
a
man
in
a
dream
he
went
into
his
chamber
and
for
a
day
and
a
night
afterwards
he
was
silent
and
his
mind
was
astray
when
he
rode
out
with
gunnar
and
högni
they
would
say
to
him
what
is
it
thou
hast
lost
brother
sigurd
could
not
tell
them
but
what
he
had
lost
was
all
memory
of
brynhild
the
valkyrie
in
the
house
of
flame
he
saw
gudrun
and
it
was
as
though
he
looked
upon
her
for
the
first
time
soft
were
the
long
tresses
of
her
hair
soft
were
her
hands
her
eyes
were
like
woodflowers
and
her
ways
and
her
speech
were
gentle
yet
was
she
noble
in
her
bearing
as
became
a
princess
who
would
come
into
a
kingdom
and
from
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
upon
grani
his
proud
horse
and
with
his
golden
helmet
above
his
golden
hair
gudrun
had
loved
sigurd
at
the
season
when
the
wild
swans
came
to
the
lake
gudrun
went
down
to
watch
them
build
their
nests
and
while
she
was
there
sigurd
rode
through
the
pines
he
saw
her
and
her
beauty
made
the
whole
place
change
he
stopped
his
horse
and
listened
to
her
voice
as
she
sang
to
the
wild
swans
sang
the
song
that
völund
made
for
alvit
his
no
more
was
sigurd
heart
empty
of
memory
it
was
filled
with
the
memory
of
gudrun
as
he
saw
her
by
the
lake
when
the
wild
swans
were
building
their
nests
and
now
he
watched
her
in
the
hall
sitting
with
her
mother
embroidering
or
serving
her
father
or
her
brothers
and
tenderness
for
the
maiden
kept
growing
in
his
heart
a
day
came
when
he
asked
gunnar
and
högni
his
sworn
brethren
for
gudrun
they
were
glad
as
though
a
great
fortune
had
befallen
them
and
they
brought
him
before
giuki
the
king
and
grimhild
the
queen
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
cast
off
all
trouble
and
care
and
entered
into
the
prime
of
their
life
and
power
so
greatly
did
the
king
and
the
queen
rejoice
at
sigurd
becoming
one
with
the
nibelungs
through
his
marriage
with
gudrun
when
gudrun
heard
that
sigurd
had
asked
for
her
she
said
to
the
queen
oh
my
mother
your
wisdom
should
have
strengthened
me
to
bear
such
joy
how
can
i
show
him
that
he
is
so
dear
so
dear
to
me
but
i
shall
try
not
to
show
it
for
he
might
deem
that
there
was
no
sense
in
me
but
sense
to
love
him
so
great
a
warrior
would
not
care
for
such
love
i
would
be
with
him
as
a
sigurd
and
gudrun
were
wed
and
all
the
kingdom
that
the
nibelungs
ruled
over
rejoiced
and
queen
grimhild
thought
that
though
the
effect
of
the
potion
she
gave
would
wear
away
his
love
for
gudrun
would
ever
fill
his
heart
and
that
no
other
memory
would
be
able
to
find
a
place
there
illustration
how
brynhild
was
won
for
gunnar
now
that
sigurd
had
wed
gudrun
he
was
one
with
the
nibelungs
the
hoard
that
was
in
fafnir
cave
he
brought
away
and
he
left
it
in
their
treasure
house
he
went
into
his
fosterfather
kingdom
again
and
he
saw
king
alv
and
hiordis
his
mother
but
he
had
no
memory
now
of
the
house
of
flame
nor
of
brynhild
who
waited
there
for
him
king
giuki
died
and
gunnar
sigurd
sworn
brother
became
king
in
his
stead
his
mother
would
have
him
wed
but
gunnar
told
her
he
had
seen
no
maiden
whom
he
would
choose
for
his
wife
but
when
sigurd
and
he
were
together
gunnar
would
speak
of
a
maiden
far
away
one
whom
he
often
thought
on
and
one
day
when
sigurd
pressed
him
to
tell
who
this
maiden
was
he
spoke
of
one
whom
the
wisest
of
the
poets
told
of
a
maiden
in
a
hall
with
a
flame
around
it
a
maiden
named
brynhild
who
was
guarded
by
a
ring
of
fire
sigurd
laughed
to
think
that
his
shrewd
brother
was
beguiled
by
one
whom
he
had
only
heard
of
but
if
he
was
beguiled
by
the
tale
of
her
why
should
he
not
come
to
her
and
wed
her
so
sigurd
said
then
gunnar
bent
to
him
and
asked
sigurd
would
he
aid
him
to
win
her
and
sigurd
took
gunnar
hand
and
swore
that
he
would
so
they
started
off
for
hindfell
gunnar
and
högni
and
sigurd
they
rode
on
until
they
came
in
sight
of
the
black
walls
with
the
mounting
and
circling
fire
around
them
no
memory
had
sigurd
of
the
place
with
the
flame
of
eagerness
upon
his
stolid
face
gunnar
went
forward
to
ride
through
the
ring
of
fire
he
brought
goti
his
horse
near
the
flame
but
the
horse
for
no
urging
would
go
through
it
then
gunnar
thought
that
mounted
on
grani
sigurd
horse
he
could
ride
through
the
ring
of
fire
he
mounted
grani
and
came
near
to
the
flaring
wall
but
grani
knowing
that
the
one
who
rode
him
had
fear
of
the
fire
reared
up
and
would
not
go
through
it
only
with
sigurd
on
his
back
would
grani
go
through
the
flame
then
were
the
three
sworn
brethren
greatly
discomfited
but
after
they
had
considered
it
for
long
högni
the
wise
said
there
is
a
way
to
win
brynhild
and
that
is
for
sigurd
to
change
shapes
by
the
magic
of
his
helmet
with
gunnar
then
sigurd
could
ride
grani
through
the
wall
of
flame
and
come
to
brynhild
in
gunnar
shape
so
spoke
högni
the
wise
and
when
he
saw
his
sworn
brother
gaze
fixed
on
him
in
pleading
sigurd
could
not
but
agree
to
ride
through
the
flame
and
come
to
brynhild
in
the
way
he
said
and
so
by
the
magic
of
his
helmet
he
changed
shapes
with
gunnar
then
he
mounted
grani
and
rode
to
the
wall
of
flame
and
grani
knowing
that
the
one
he
bore
was
without
fear
rode
through
the
flaring
fire
then
sigurd
came
into
the
courtyard
of
the
house
of
flame
he
dismounted
from
grani
and
he
bade
his
horse
be
still
he
went
within
the
hall
and
he
saw
one
with
a
bow
in
her
hands
shooting
at
a
mark
she
turned
to
him
and
he
saw
a
beautiful
and
stern
face
with
coils
of
wondrous
hair
and
eyes
that
were
like
stars
in
an
sea
he
thought
that
the
arrow
in
her
hands
had
been
shot
through
him
but
it
was
not
so
brynhild
threw
down
the
bow
and
came
to
him
with
that
walk
of
hers
that
was
as
of
one
moving
above
the
earth
and
when
she
came
near
and
looked
upon
him
she
uttered
a
strange
cry
who
art
thou
she
said
who
art
thou
who
hast
come
to
me
through
the
wall
of
flaring
fire
gunnar
son
of
giuki
of
the
race
of
the
nibelungs
sigurd
said
art
thou
the
bravest
one
in
the
world
she
asked
i
have
ridden
through
the
wall
of
flaring
fire
to
come
to
thee
sigurd
answered
he
who
has
come
through
that
wall
of
flaring
fire
may
claim
me
brynhild
said
it
is
written
in
the
runes
and
it
must
be
so
but
i
thought
there
was
only
one
who
would
come
to
me
through
it
she
looked
at
him
and
her
eyes
had
a
flame
of
anger
oh
i
would
strive
with
thee
with
she
cried
then
sigurd
felt
her
strong
hands
upon
him
and
he
knew
that
she
was
striving
to
throw
him
they
wrestled
and
each
was
so
strong
that
none
could
move
the
other
they
wrestled
sigurd
the
first
of
heroes
and
brynhild
the
valkyrie
sigurd
got
her
hand
in
his
in
the
wrestle
on
that
hand
was
a
ring
and
sigurd
bent
back
the
finger
and
drew
it
off
it
was
andvari
ring
the
ring
he
had
placed
on
her
finger
and
when
the
ring
was
taken
off
it
brynhild
sank
down
on
her
knees
like
one
that
was
strengthless
then
sigurd
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
where
grani
his
horse
was
waiting
he
lifted
her
across
his
horse
and
he
mounted
behind
her
and
again
he
rode
through
the
wall
of
flame
högni
and
gunnar
were
waiting
gunnar
in
sigurd
shape
brynhild
did
not
look
upon
them
but
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
then
sigurd
took
back
his
own
shape
and
he
rode
before
gunnar
and
högni
to
the
hall
of
the
nibelungs
he
went
within
and
he
found
gudrun
his
wife
playing
with
sigmund
his
little
son
and
he
sat
beside
her
and
he
told
her
of
all
that
had
befallen
how
for
the
sake
of
the
sworn
brotherhood
he
had
won
brynhild
the
valkyrie
for
gunnar
and
how
he
had
striven
with
her
and
had
overcome
her
and
had
taken
off
her
finger
the
ring
that
he
now
wore
upon
his
own
and
even
as
he
spoke
to
his
wife
the
fume
of
the
potion
that
mother
had
given
him
was
wearing
off
and
he
had
memories
of
going
to
the
house
of
flame
on
a
day
that
was
not
this
day
and
of
riding
through
the
wall
of
fire
in
his
own
shape
and
again
as
on
the
night
when
he
drank
the
potion
that
queen
grimhild
brewed
he
became
as
one
whose
wits
are
astray
he
stood
watching
his
child
as
he
played
and
his
wife
as
she
worked
at
her
embroidery
and
he
was
as
a
man
in
a
dream
while
he
was
standing
there
gunnar
and
högni
came
into
the
hall
of
the
nibelungs
bringing
brynhild
with
them
gudrun
rose
up
to
welcome
her
who
came
as
her
brother
bride
then
did
sigurd
look
on
brynhild
and
then
did
he
remember
all
and
when
he
remembered
all
such
a
mighty
sigh
rose
from
his
heart
as
burst
the
links
of
the
mail
that
was
across
his
breast
illustration
the
death
of
sigurd
it
happened
one
day
that
brynhild
gunnar
wife
now
a
queen
was
with
sigurd
wife
bathing
in
a
river
not
often
they
were
together
brynhild
was
the
haughtiest
of
women
and
often
she
treated
gudrun
with
disdain
now
as
they
were
bathing
together
gudrun
shaking
out
her
hair
cast
some
drops
upon
brynhild
brynhild
went
from
gudrun
and
sigurd
wife
not
knowing
that
brynhild
had
anger
against
her
went
after
her
up
the
stream
why
dost
thou
go
so
far
up
the
river
brynhild
gudrun
asked
so
that
thou
mayst
not
shake
thy
hair
over
me
answered
brynhild
gudrun
stood
still
while
brynhild
went
up
the
river
like
a
creature
who
was
made
to
be
alone
why
dost
thou
speak
so
to
me
sister
gudrun
cried
she
remembered
that
from
the
first
brynhild
had
been
haughty
with
her
often
speaking
to
her
with
harshness
and
bitterness
she
did
not
know
what
cause
brynhild
had
for
this
it
was
because
brynhild
had
seen
in
sigurd
the
one
who
had
ridden
through
the
fire
for
the
first
time
he
who
had
awakened
her
by
breaking
the
binding
of
her
breastplate
and
so
drawing
out
of
her
flesh
the
thorn
of
the
tree
of
sleep
she
had
given
him
her
love
when
she
awakened
on
the
world
but
he
as
she
thought
had
forgotten
her
easily
giving
his
love
to
this
other
maiden
brynhild
with
her
valkyrie
pride
was
left
with
a
mighty
anger
in
her
heart
why
dost
thou
speak
so
to
me
brynhild
gudrun
asked
it
would
be
ill
indeed
if
drops
from
thy
hair
fell
on
one
who
is
so
much
above
thee
one
who
is
king
gunnar
wife
brynhild
answered
thou
art
married
to
a
king
but
not
to
one
more
valorous
than
my
lord
gudrun
said
gunnar
is
more
valorous
why
dost
thou
compare
sigurd
with
him
brynhild
said
he
slew
the
dragon
fafnir
and
won
for
himself
fafnir
hoard
said
gudrun
gunnar
rode
through
the
ring
of
fire
mayhap
thou
wilt
tell
us
that
sigurd
did
the
like
said
brynhild
yea
said
gudrun
now
made
angry
it
was
sigurd
and
not
gunnar
who
rode
through
the
ring
of
fire
he
rode
through
it
in
gunnar
shape
and
he
took
the
ring
off
thy
finger
look
it
is
now
on
mine
and
gudrun
held
out
her
hand
on
which
was
andvari
ring
then
brynhild
knew
all
at
once
that
what
gudrun
said
was
true
it
was
sigurd
that
rode
through
the
ring
of
fire
the
second
as
well
as
the
first
time
it
was
he
who
had
struggled
with
her
taking
the
ring
off
her
hand
and
claiming
her
for
a
bride
not
for
himself
but
for
another
and
out
of
disdain
falsely
had
she
been
won
and
she
one
of
odin
valkyries
had
been
wed
to
one
who
was
not
the
bravest
hero
in
the
world
and
she
to
whom
untruth
might
not
come
had
been
deceived
she
was
silent
now
and
all
the
pride
that
was
in
her
turned
to
hatred
of
sigurd
she
went
to
gunnar
her
husband
and
she
told
him
that
she
was
so
deeply
shamed
that
she
could
never
be
glad
in
his
hall
again
that
never
would
he
see
her
drinking
wine
nor
embroidering
with
golden
threads
and
never
would
he
hear
her
speaking
words
of
kindness
and
when
she
said
this
to
him
she
rent
the
web
she
was
weaving
and
she
wept
aloud
so
that
all
in
the
hall
heard
her
and
all
marveled
to
hear
the
proud
queen
cry
then
sigurd
came
to
her
and
he
offered
in
atonement
the
whole
hoard
of
fafnir
and
he
told
her
how
forgetfulness
of
her
had
come
upon
him
and
he
begged
her
to
forgive
him
for
winning
her
in
falseness
but
she
answered
him
too
late
thou
hast
come
to
me
sigurd
now
i
have
only
a
great
anger
in
my
heart
when
gunnar
came
she
told
him
she
would
forgive
him
and
love
him
as
she
had
not
loved
him
before
if
he
would
slay
sigurd
but
gunnar
would
not
slay
him
although
brynhild
passion
moved
him
greatly
since
sigurd
was
a
sworn
brother
of
his
then
she
went
to
högni
and
asked
him
to
slay
sigurd
telling
him
that
the
whole
of
fafnir
hoard
would
belong
to
the
nibelungs
if
sigurd
were
slain
but
högni
would
not
slay
him
since
sigurd
and
he
were
sworn
brothers
there
was
one
who
had
not
sworn
brotherhood
with
sigurd
he
was
guttorm
gunnar
and
högni
brynhild
went
to
guttorm
he
would
not
slay
sigurd
but
brynhild
found
that
he
was
infirm
of
will
and
unsteady
of
thought
with
guttorm
then
she
would
work
for
the
slaying
of
sigurd
her
mind
was
fixed
that
he
and
she
would
no
longer
be
in
the
world
of
men
she
made
a
dish
of
madness
for
guttorm
serpent
venom
and
wolf
flesh
mixed
and
when
he
had
eaten
it
guttorm
was
crazed
then
did
he
listen
to
brynhild
words
and
she
commanded
him
to
go
into
the
chamber
where
sigurd
slept
and
stab
him
through
the
body
with
a
sword
this
guttorm
did
but
sigurd
before
he
gasped
out
his
life
took
gram
his
great
sword
and
flung
it
at
guttorm
and
cut
him
in
twain
and
brynhild
knowing
what
deed
was
done
went
without
and
came
to
where
grani
sigurd
proud
horse
was
standing
she
stayed
there
with
her
arms
across
grani
neck
the
valkyrie
leaning
across
the
horse
that
was
born
of
odin
horse
and
grani
stood
listening
for
some
sound
he
heard
the
cries
of
gudrun
over
sigurd
and
then
his
heart
burst
and
he
died
they
bore
sigurd
out
of
the
hall
and
brynhild
went
beside
where
they
placed
him
she
took
a
sword
and
put
it
through
her
own
heart
thus
died
brynhild
who
had
been
made
a
mortal
woman
for
her
disobedience
to
the
will
of
odin
and
who
was
won
to
be
a
mortal
wife
by
a
falseness
they
took
sigurd
and
his
horse
grani
and
his
helmet
and
his
golden
and
they
left
all
on
a
great
painted
ship
they
could
not
but
leave
brynhild
beside
him
brynhild
with
her
wondrous
hair
and
her
stern
and
beautiful
face
they
left
the
two
together
and
launched
the
ship
on
the
sea
and
when
the
ship
was
on
the
water
they
fired
it
and
brynhild
once
again
lay
in
the
flames
and
so
sigurd
and
brynhild
went
together
to
join
baldur
and
nanna
in
hela
habitation
gunnar
and
högni
came
to
dread
the
evil
that
was
in
the
hoard
they
took
the
gleaming
and
glittering
mass
and
they
brought
it
to
the
river
along
which
ages
before

but
not
for

were
they
to

and
to

for

the

that
was
called
the

winter
was
coming
over

the

the
twilight
of

fell
on
the
four
quarters
of
the

icy
winds
blew
from
every
side
the
sun
and
the

were
hidden
by

it
was
the
fimbul
winter
no
spring
came
and
no
summer
no
autumn
brought
harvest
or

and
winter
grew
into

the
winter
of

storms
blew

were
mighty
the

dread
winter
the
second
winter
was

the
winter

slew
him
and
over

there
were
mighty

the
wolf
that
was
to
be
the
devourer

the

the
champions
in

would
find
their
seats
splashed
with
the
blood
that
managarm
dashed
from
his
jaws
this
was
a
sign
to
the
gods
that
the
time
of
the
last
battle
was
approaching
a
cock

far
down
in

he
was

there
was
a
rending
noise
as
the
giants
moved
their
ship
there
was
a
trampling
sound
as
the
hosts
of
muspelheim
gathered
their
horses
but
jötunheim
and
muspelheim
and
hel
waited
tremblingly
it
might
be
that
fenrir

might
not
burst
the

up
from

of

drew

by

he
made

speak
to

where

who
were
the

to

there
such
war
that
the
powers
of

would
be
destroyed

should
be
destroyed
with

reached
bifröst
the

now
would
they
storm
the

and
fill
it
with

the

was
swept
away
that
mighty
flood
floated

the

came
all

was
shaken
in

its

to
the
place
where
the

had
drawn
up
their

came
the

came
the

the

upon

and
out
of
the
sea
that
now
surrounded
the
plain
of
vigard
the
serpent
jörmungand
came
what
said
odin
to
the
gods
and
to
the
champions
who
surrounded
him
we
will
give
our
lives
and
let
our
world
be
destroyed

we
will
battle
so
that
these
evil
powers
will
not
live
after

out
of

ship
sprang
fenrir
the

the

the
wolf
odin
was
slain
but
the
younger
gods
were
now
advancing
to
the
battle
and
vidar
the
silent
god
came
face

he
laid

foot
that

made
of

the
scraps
of

that
shoemakers
had
laid
by
for
him
and
with
his
hands
he
seized
the
upper
jaw
and
tore
his
gullet
thus
died
fenrir
the
fiercest
of
all
the
enemies
of
the
gods
jörmungand
the
monstrous
serpent
would
have
overwhelmed

crushed
him
with
a
stroke
of

loki
slew

many
of
the
powers

perished
by

strong
left

the
hound
with

slew

now
the
riders
