chapter
one
bonnie
dundee
stretched
out
a
long
and
rather
fine
pair
of
legs
regarding
the
pattern
of
his
socks
with
distinct
satisfaction
then
he
rested
his
black
head
against
the
rich
upholstery
of
an
armchair
not
at
all
intended
for
his
use
his
cheerful
blue
eyes
turned
at
last
but
not
too
long
a
last
to
the
small
upright
figure
seated
at
a
typewriter
desk
in
the
corner
of
the
office
good
morning
penny
he
called
out
lazily
and
waited
for
the
storm
to
break
miss
crain
to
the
flying
fingers
did
not
stop
an
instant
but
dundee
noticed
with
glee
that
the
slim
back
stiffened
even
more
rigidly
and
that
there
was
a
decided
toss
of
the
brown
bobbed
head
but
penny
is
so
much
more
like
you
dundee
protested
unruffled
and
why
should
i
be
forced
always
to
think
of
you
as
a
bird
when
even
our
mutual
boss
district
attorney
william
sanderson
has
the
privilege
of
calling
you
what
you
are
a
bright
and
shining
new
penny
i
known
bill
sanderson
since
i
was
born
the
unseen
lips
informed
him
truculently
even
as
the
unseen
fingers
continued
their
fiercely
staccato
typing
ah
that
explains
a
lot
dundee
conceded
handsomely
i
just
wondered
amidst
all
this
bonhommie
of
and
why
i
i
only
call
sanderson
when
i
forget
the
small
creature
defended
herself
sharply
goodness
knows
i
to
be
an
efficient
private
secretary
and
i
could
be
a
lot
more
efficient
if
lazy
strangers
did
plump
themselves
down
in
our
best
visitors
chair
and
try
to
flirt
with
me
i
do
flirt
do
you
hear
do
flirt
with
anybody
flirt
with
you
you
funny
little
penny
dundee
voice
was
a
little
sad
the
voice
of
a
man
who
finds
himself
grievously
misunderstood
i
only
want
you
to
like
me
if
you
can
and
be
a
little
nice
to
me
for
after
all
i
oh
i
know
penny
crain
jerked
the
finished
letter
from
her
typewriter
and
spun
about
on
her
swivel
chair
to
face
him
i
know
you
are
james
dundee
special
investigator
attached
to
the
office
of
the
district
attorney
and
that
you
have
a
right
to
drive
me
crazy
if
you
want
to
dundee
was
genuinely
amazed
contrite
i
beg
your
pardon
most
humbly
miss
crain
i
go
back
to
my
cell
your
office
is
almost
as
big
and
nice
as
this
one
penny
retorted
but
her
sharp
bright
brown
eyes
really
almost
the
color
of
a
new
penny
softened
until
they
took
on
a
velvety
depth
dundee
did
not
fail
to
notice
the
softening
nor
did
the
little
face
with
its
low
its
straight
short
nose
and
its
pointed
little
chin
made
almost
childish
by
the
deep
cleft
which
cut
through
its
obvious
effort
to
look
mature
and
determined
fail
to
please
him
any
more
acutely
than
on
the
other
days
of
the
one
short
week
he
had
been
privileged
at
intervals
to
gaze
upon
it
but
the
files
and
other
things
are
in
this
office
he
told
her
his
blue
eyes
twinkling
happily
once
more
do
you
touch
my
files
again
penny
cried
springing
to
her
feet
and
running
toward
the
wall
which
was
completely
concealed
by
drawers
cabinets
and
shelves
filled
with
the
records
of
which
she
was
the
proud
custodian
that
why
i
said
just
now
that
you
were
driving
me
crazy
thursday
you
took
a
whole
folder
of
correspondence
out
of
the
letter
files
and
put
it
back
under
the
wrong
initial
i
had
to
hunt
for
it
for
two
hours
with
bill
i
mean
sanderson
gnawing
his
nails
with
impatience
he
thought
i
had
filed
it
wrong
and
you
might
have
made
me
lose
my
job
unconsciously
her
slightly
husky
contralto
voice
had
sunk
lower
and
trembled
audibly
i
awfully
sorry
i
sha
touch
your
files
again
miss
crain
oh
go
on
and
call
me
penny
she
conceded
impatiently
what
do
you
want
now
and
you
can
get
anything
you
need
out
of
the
files
if
you
just
put
the
folder
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
my
desk
so
that
i
can
file
it
myself
correctly
thank
you
penny
bonnie
dundee
said
gravely
i
like
awfully
to
have
the
complete
transcript
of
state
versus
maginty
sanderson
is
determined
to
get
a
conviction
where
our
former
district
attorney
most
ingloriously
failed
the
new
trial
comes
up
in
two
weeks
and
he
wants
me
to
try
to
uncover
a
missing
link
of
evidence
i
know
she
nodded
and
stretched
her
short
slender
body
to
pull
down
the
two
heavy
volumes
he
required
without
a
special
investigator
dundee
resumed
his
comfortable
seat
and
laid
the
first
of
the
volumes
open
upon
his
knees
but
he
did
not
seem
to
take
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
the
impanelling
of
jurors
in
the
case
of
one
rufus
maginty
who
had
won
the
temporary
triumph
of
a
hung
jury
under
the
handling
of
the
state
case
by
district
attorney
sherwood
deposed
in
november
election
rather
his
eyes
followed
the
small
brisk
figure
of
miss
penelope
crain
as
it
moved
about
the
room
and
his
ears
listened
to
the
somehow
charming
though
emphatic
tapping
of
her
french
heels
french
heels
had
she
been
wearing
sensible
oxfords
all
other
days
of
this
first
week
of
his
attachment
to
the
district
office
cunning
little
thing
for
all
her
thorniness
and
her
sharpness
with
him
which
he
now
saw
that
he
had
deserved
pretty
too
damned
pretty
what
color
was
that
dress
of
hers
ummm
let
see
chartreuse
did
they
call
it
chartreuse
with
big
brown
dots
in
it
bet
it
was
sleeveless
under
that
short
little
jacket
of
chiffon
velvet
by
jove
and
dundee
lapsed
into
one
of
the
englishisms
he
had
picked
up
during
his
six
months
work
in
england
as
a
tyro
in
the
records
department
of
scotland
yard
before
he
had
come
to
hamilton
to
make
a
humble
beginning
as
a
cub
detective
on
the
homicide
squad
yes
by
jove
she
was
all
dressed
up
for
some
reason
or
other
of
course
because
it
saturday
and
you
have
the
afternoon
off
dundee
finished
his
reverie
aloud
to
the
astonishment
of
the
small
person
trying
to
reach
a
file
drawer
just
a
little
too
high
for
her
i
mean
he
hastened
to
explain
that
i
just
noticed
how
beautiful
your
costume
is
and
found
a
reason
for
it
there
was
sudden
color
in
the
creamy
face
the
french
heels
tapped
an
angry
progress
across
the
big
office
and
penny
sat
down
abruptly
in
her
swivel
chair
reached
across
the
immaculate
desk
snatched
up
a
morning
paper
and
tossed
it
without
a
glance
in
the
general
direction
of
her
tormentor
page
three
column
two
first
item
she
informed
him
ungraciously
and
then
began
to
search
with
a
funny
sort
of
desperation
for
more
work
to
consume
her
extraordinary
energy
bonnie
dundee
grinned
indulgently
as
he
opened
hamilton
morning
and
turned
to
the
specified
page
and
column
ah
my
old
friend
the
editress
in
her
very
best
style
he
commented
as
he
began
to
read
aloud
juanita
selim
new
and
charming
member
is
entertaining
the
forsyte
alumnae
bridge
club
this
afternoon
luncheon
to
be
served
at
the
exclusive
new
breakaway
inn
on
sheridan
road
i
read
it
and
i
busy
so
shut
up
penny
commanded
as
she
gathered
up
pencils
to
sharpen
quite
meekly
bonnie
dundee
subsided
into
silent
perusal
of
an
item
he
was
sure
could
have
no
possible
interest
for
himself
in
either
a
personal
or
professional
capacity
unless
penny
name
was
in
it
somewhere
after
which
the
jolly
party
of
young
matrons
and
maids
will
adjourn
to
selim
delightful
home
in
the
primrose
meadows
addition
he
chuckled
and
dared
to
interrupt
the
high
importance
of
pencils
i
say
that
funny
is
it
meadows
addition
i
do
think
it
funny
penny
retorted
coldly
it
so
happens
that
my
mother
named
it
that
my
father
went
into
bankruptcy
trying
to
make
a
go
of
it
and
that
selim
delightful
home
was
built
to
be
our
home
and
in
which
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
live
only
two
months
before
the
crash
came
oh
dundee
groaned
penny
penny
i
dreadfully
sorry
shut
up
she
ordered
but
her
voice
was
huskier
than
ever
with
tears
dundee
now
thoroughly
interested
eyes
raced
down
the
absurdly
written
paragraphs
although
not
an
alumna
of
that
famous
and
select
school
for
girls
graduation
from
which
places
any
hamilton
girl
in
the
very
inner
circle
of
hamilton
society
selim
has
been
closely
identified
with
the
school
having
for
the
past
two
years
directed
and
staged
forsyte
annual
play
which
ushers
in
the
easter
vacation
indeed
it
was
selim
remarkable
success
with
this
year
play
which
caused
peter
dunlap
long
interested
in
a
little
theater
for
hamilton
to
induce
the
beautiful
and
charming
young
directress
to
come
to
hamilton
with
her
plans
for
the
little
theater
are
growing
apace
and
it
is
safe
to
conjecture
that
not
all
the
conversation
flying
thick
and
fast
about
bridge
tables
this
afternoon
will
be
concerned
with
contract
scores
and
finesses
which
failed
lovely
was
elected
to
membership
a
fortnight
ago
when
a
vacancy
occurred
due
to
the
resignation
of
miss
alice
humphrey
who
has
gone
abroad
for
a
year
study
in
the
sorbonne
the
club
now
includes
mesdames
hugo
marshall
tracey
a
miles
peter
dunlap
john
drake
juanita
selim
and
misses
polly
beale
janet
raymond
and
penelope
crain
dundee
lowered
the
paper
and
stared
at
the
profile
of
district
attorney
sanderson
private
secretary
so
she
was
a
society
girl
a
forsyte
girl
was
that
the
reason
perhaps
why
she
had
been
so
thorny
with
him
a
mere
dick
well
he
was
just
a
dick
any
longer
he
was
a
special
investigator
a
society
girl
playing
at
work
but
there
was
more
and
he
read
on
as
is
well
known
the
have
their
every
saturday
afternoon
from
the
first
of
october
to
the
first
of
june
and
a
in
which
mere
men
are
graciously
included
every
other
wednesday
evening
during
the
season
and
tracey
a
miles
are
scheduled
as
next
wednesday
host
and
hostess
i
take
off
my
hat
to
your
editress
dundee
commented
with
false
cheerfulness
when
he
had
laid
the
paper
back
upon
penny
desk
she
makes
half
a
column
of
this
one
item
in
what
must
be
a
meager
saturday
bunch
of
notes
then
writes
it
all
over
again
in
the
past
tense
for
an
equally
meager
monday
column
like
bridge
miss
crain
penny
snatched
up
the
paper
and
crushed
it
into
her
wastebasket
i
do
and
i
like
my
old
friends
even
if
i
am
not
able
financially
to
keep
up
with
them
if
that
why
you
suddenly
decided
to
stop
being
comrades
please
forgive
me
again
penny
he
begged
gently
i
was
born
into
that
crowd
and
i
still
belong
to
it
because
all
of
them
are
my
real
friends
but
get
this
into
your
thick
head
dundee
i
working
because
i
have
to
and
and
because
i
love
it
too
and
because
i
want
to
earn
enough
before
i
many
years
older
to
give
mother
some
of
the
things
she
missing
so
dreadfully
since
since
my
father
failed
and
and
ran
away
ran
away
dundee
echoed
incredulously
how
could
any
man
desert
a
daughter
like
this
yes
ran
away
she
repeated
fiercely
i
might
as
well
tell
you
myself
plenty
of
others
will
be
willing
to
as
soon
as
they
know
you
are
my
friend
as
i
told
you
my
father
her
voice
broke
my
father
went
bankrupt
but
before
the
courts
knew
it
he
had
sent
some
securities
to
a
to
a
in
new
york
and
when
he
left
us
he
went
to
her
because
he
left
mother
a
note
saying
so
his
defrauded
creditors
here
have
tried
to
to
catch
him
but
they
have
yet
very
gently
bonnie
dundee
took
the
small
hand
that
was
distractedly
rumpling
the
brown
waves
which
swept
back
from
the
it
lay
fluttering
in
his
bigger
palm
for
a
moment
then
snatched
itself
away
i
wo
have
you
feeling
sorry
for
me
she
cried
angrily
who
owns
your
the
primrose
meadows
house
now
mrs
selim
he
asked
the
nita
her
voice
was
scornful
no
she
rents
it
from
judge
hugo
marshall
or
is
supposed
to
pay
him
rent
she
added
with
a
trace
of
malice
hugo
is
an
old
darling
but
he
is
fearfully
weak
where
pretty
women
are
concerned
nita
selim
had
known
hugo
in
new
york
somehow
and
as
soon
as
lois
dunlap
i
mean
had
got
nita
off
the
train
the
stranger
in
our
midst
hied
herself
to
hugo
office
and
he
been
tagging
after
her
ever
since
though
most
of
the
men
in
our
crowd
are
as
bad
as
or
worse
than
poor
old
hugo
how
karen
keeps
on
looking
so
blissfully
happy
karen
dundee
interrupted
hugo
marshall
she
explained
impatiently
karen
plummer
made
her
debut
a
year
ago
this
last
winter
a
darling
of
a
girl
judge
marshall
retired
judge
you
know
had
been
proposing
to
the
prettiest
girl
in
each
season
crop
of
debs
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
hugo
must
have
been
the
most
nonplussed
bachelor
who
ever
led
a
grand
march
when
karen
snapped
him
up
loved
him
actually
and
it
seems
to
have
worked
out
marvelously
a
baby
boy
three
months
old
she
concluded
in
her
laconic
style
then
ashamed
i
do
know
why
gossiping
like
this
because
you
ca
find
another
blessed
scrap
of
work
to
do
you
little
efficiency
fiend
dundee
laughed
come
on
gossip
some
more
my
maginty
case
will
wait
till
afternoon
to
be
mulled
over
while
losing
your
salary
at
bridge
with
rich
women
we
do
play
for
high
stakes
she
corrected
him
just
a
twentieth
of
a
cent
a
point
though
contract
can
run
into
money
even
at
that
the
winnings
all
go
to
the
forsyte
scholarship
fund
on
wednesday
evenings
the
crowd
plays
for
higher
stakes
a
tenth
and
winners
keepers
therefore
i
ca
afford
to
go
unless
i
sink
so
low
as
to
let
my
escort
pay
my
losses
which
i
sometimes
do
she
confessed
her
brown
head
low
for
a
moment
is
this
peter
dunlap
a
club
woman
who
starts
movements
he
asked
more
to
bring
her
out
of
her
depression
than
anything
else
bigger
and
better
babies
movements
and
homes
for
fallen
girls
and
little
theater
movements
the
brown
head
flung
itself
up
sharply
and
the
brown
eyes
hardened
into
bright
pennies
again
lois
dunlap
is
the
sweetest
finest
most
woman
in
hamilton
and
i
adore
her
as
does
everyone
else
peter
dunlap
hardly
more
than
the
rest
of
us
she
interested
in
a
little
theater
for
hamilton
but
she
wo
manage
it
that
why
she
got
hold
of
nita
selim
lois
will
simply
put
up
barrels
of
money
without
missing
them
and
give
a
grand
job
to
a
little
broadway
funny
thing
is
she
really
delights
in
nita
thinks
she
sweet
and
has
never
had
a
real
chance
and
what
do
you
think
dundee
asked
softly
oh
i
suppose
i
a
cat
but
i
can
see
through
her
so
clearly
not
that
she
bad
she
simply
an
opportunist
she
awfully
sweet
and
deferential
and
with
women
but
with
men
well
she
simply
tucks
her
head
so
that
her
black
curls
fall
forward
enchantingly
gives
them
one
wistful
smile
out
of
her
big
eyes
that
are
like
black
pansies
and
the
clink
of
slave
chains
now
go
on
and
think
i
catty
which
i
suppose
i
am
bonnie
dundee
grinned
at
her
reassuringly
not
for
him
to
explain
that
practically
all
women
and
many
men
found
themselves
gossiping
when
he
led
them
on
adroitly
for
reasons
of
his
own
which
of
course
helped
make
him
the
excellent
detective
he
was
so
all
the
men
in
your
crowd
have
fallen
for
nita
selim
have
they
practically
all
in
varying
degrees
except
peter
dunlap
who
has
never
looked
at
another
woman
since
he
was
lucky
enough
to
get
lois
and
clive
hammond
who
engaged
to
polly
beale
penny
answered
reluctantly
her
color
high
including
young
man
i
have
a
man
in
the
sense
of
being
engaged
penny
retorted
then
added
honestly
i
been
letting
ralph
hammond
that
clive
brother
you
know
take
me
about
a
good
deal
ralph
and
clive
have
plenty
of
money
she
defended
herself
hastily
they
are
architects
clive
being
the
head
of
the
firm
and
ralph
who
has
been
out
of
college
so
very
long
a
junior
partner
it
was
the
hammond
firm
that
drew
up
the
plans
for
dad
i
mean
my
father
primrose
meadows
addition
houses
he
had
our
house
built
as
a
sort
of
you
know
so
that
prospective
builders
out
there
could
see
how
artistic
a
home
could
be
put
up
for
a
moderate
sum
of
money
but
he
did
quite
finish
even
that
left
half
the
gabled
top
story
unfinished
and
nita
has
been
teasing
hugo
to
finish
it
up
for
her
it
looks
she
added
with
a
shrug
as
if
nita
will
get
what
she
wants
as
usual
and
ralph
has
acquired
a
set
of
slave
chains
dundee
suggested
with
just
the
slightest
note
of
sympathy
how
penny
assured
him
grimly
a
simile
as
as
my
clothes
are
going
to
be
if
i
do
get
some
new
ones
soon
not
that
the
crowd
minds
what
i
wear
she
added
loyally
i
could
dress
up
in
a
window
drape
and
be
just
as
charming
as
you
are
in
that
grand
new
party
dress
you
have
on
now
dundee
finished
for
her
gallantly
penny
snorted
and
turned
back
to
her
desk
in
a
futile
effort
to
find
something
left
undone
dundee
ignored
the
rebuff
how
many
suckers
i
mean
how
many
gentlemen
with
moderate
incomes
actually
built
in
primrose
meadows
you
are
inquisitive
are
you
none
our
house
or
rather
the
one
nita
selim
is
living
in
now
is
the
only
house
on
what
used
to
be
a
big
farm
why
i
was
just
wondering
dundee
said
softly
almost
why
the
nita
chose
so
isolated
a
place
in
which
to
live
when
hamilton
has
rather
a
large
number
of
rent
signs
out
just
now
by
the
way
know
what
time
it
is
now
twenty
to
one
get
your
hat
on
young
woman
i
going
to
drive
you
out
to
breakaway
inn
you
not
i
going
to
take
a
bus
one
runs
from
the
square
right
past
the
inn
she
told
him
firmly
and
just
as
firmly
dundee
escorted
her
out
of
the
almost
deserted
rather
dirty
old
courthouse
to
where
his
sports
roadster
bought
on
time
was
awaiting
them
in
the
parking
space
devoted
to
the
motors
of
those
who
officially
served
hamilton
county
i
know
why
you
want
to
drive
me
out
to
the
inn
penny
told
him
suddenly
as
the
proud
owner
maneuvered
his
car
through
saturday
noon
traffic
you
want
to
see
nita
selim
clank
clank
i
can
hear
the
padlocks
snapping
on
the
slave
chains
right
now
meow
dundee
retorted
then
grinned
down
at
her
with
as
much
comradely
affection
as
if
they
had
been
friends
for
years
instead
of
for
a
couple
of
hours
is
nita
very
small
he
added
little
enough
to
tuck
herself
under
the
arm
of
a
man
a
lot
shorter
than
you
penny
assured
him
with
curious
vehemence
and
if
penelope
crain
is
no
mean
prophet
that
exactly
what
she
do
within
five
minutes
after
she
meets
you
just
as
she
is
wistfully
inviting
you
to
join
the
other
men
for
the
cocktail
party
which
is
scheduled
to
break
up
the
bridge
game
at
then
of
course
you
be
urged
to
join
us
all
at
the
at
the
country
club
tonight
will
she
dundee
pretended
to
be
vastly
intrigued
which
caused
the
remainder
of
the
drive
to
be
a
rather
silent
one
due
to
unresponsiveness
breakaway
inn
was
intensely
spanish
in
architecture
and
transplanted
shrubbery
but
its
stucco
walls
were
of
a
rather
more
violent
raspberry
color
than
is
considered
quite
esthetic
in
spain
or
mexico
there
lois
dunlap
car
just
driving
up
penny
cried
her
face
softening
with
the
adoration
she
had
freely
professed
for
her
friend
but
it
clouded
again
almost
instantly
and
nita
selim
i
suppose
nita
was
a
little
ashamed
to
drive
up
in
her
own
ford
coupe
as
dundee
helped
his
new
friend
to
alight
his
eyes
were
upon
the
two
women
being
assisted
by
a
uniformed
chauffeur
from
lois
limousine
in
a
moment
the
four
were
a
laughing
exclamatory
group
oh
what
a
tall
grand
man
you
got
yourself
penny
darling
the
tiny
beautiful
creature
who
could
only
be
selim
cried
out
happily
i
meet
him
i
should
let
you
penny
answered
frankly
but
i
will
selim
dundee
and
dunlap
dundee
how
are
you
lois
and
peter
and
the
brats
all
well
penny
petey
off
on
a
fishing
trip
and
not
one
of
the
brats
has
measles
scarlet
fever
or
hay
fever
thank
god
dundee
heard
dunlap
say
in
the
comfortable
affectionate
voice
that
went
with
her
comfortable
pleasant
face
and
body
nice
woman
but
his
eyes
were
of
necessity
upon
nita
selim
for
that
miniature
venus
was
as
penny
had
predicted
almost
tucked
under
his
arm
by
this
time
her
eyes
wide
and
wistful
her
soft
black
curls
falling
forward
as
she
coaxed
you
come
to
the
cocktail
party
at
my
house
at
wo
you
mr
dundee
afraid
i
ca
make
it
dundee
smiled
down
at
her
i
a
busy
man
selim
you
see
i
special
investigator
attached
to
the
district
attorney
office
he
explained
very
deliberately
nita
selim
breathed
than
step
by
step
she
withdrew
so
that
he
was
no
longer
submitted
to
the
temptation
to
put
his
arm
about
her
too
intriguing
little
body
and
as
she
retreated
dundee
keen
eyes
noted
a
hardening
of
the
eyes
the
sudden
throbbing
of
a
pulse
in
her
very
white
neck
no
do
mind
about
calling
for
me
penny
protested
a
moment
later
ralph
has
already
volunteered
thanks
awfully
as
dundee
backed
out
of
the
driveway
his
last
glance
was
for
a
very
small
figure
in
a
brown
silk
summer
coat
and
palest
yellow
chiffon
frock
slowly
rejoining
penelope
crain
and
lois
dunlap
what
the
devil
had
frightened
her
so
for
she
had
been
almost
terrified
of
course
she
might
be
one
of
those
silly
women
who
shudder
at
the
sight
of
a
detective
because
they
smuggled
in
a
diamond
from
paris
or
a
bottle
of
bacardi
from
havana
but
long
before
his
car
made
the
distance
back
to
the
city
dundee
had
shrugged
off
the
riddle
and
was
concentrating
on
all
the
facts
he
knew
regarding
the
maginty
case
it
was
his
first
real
assignment
from
sanderson
and
he
was
determined
to
make
good
four
hours
later
he
was
interrupted
in
his
careful
reading
of
the
trial
of
rufus
maginty
by
the
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell
that
made
four
times
he
had
had
to
snap
out
the
fact
that
district
attorney
sanderson
was
playing
some
golf
on
the
country
club
links
dundee
reflected
angrily
as
he
picked
up
the
receiver
but
the
call
was
for
dundee
himself
and
the
voice
on
the
other
end
of
the
wire
was
penny
crain
although
almost
unrecognizable
speak
more
slowly
penny
dundee
urged
what
that
again
good
lord
you
say
that
nita
selim
after
a
minute
of
listening
and
a
promise
of
instant
obedience
dundee
hung
up
the
receiver
my
god
he
said
slowly
blankly
of
all
things
at
chapter
two
as
special
investigator
dundee
drove
through
the
city
of
hamilton
at
a
speed
of
sixty
miles
an
hour
his
way
being
cleared
by
traffic
policemen
warned
by
the
shrill
official
siren
which
served
him
as
a
horn
he
had
little
time
to
think
connectedly
of
the
fact
that
nita
selim
had
been
murdered
during
a
bridge
game
in
her
rented
home
in
primrose
meadows
even
after
the
broad
sleekness
of
sheridan
road
stretched
before
him
he
could
do
little
more
than
try
to
realize
the
shock
which
had
numbed
him
lovely
nita
as
the
society
editor
of
morning
had
called
her
was
how
why
he
did
not
know
he
had
asked
no
details
of
penny
crain
funny
thorny
little
penny
loyal
little
penny
judge
marshall
has
telephoned
police
headquarters
she
had
told
him
breathlessly
over
the
telephone
but
i
made
him
let
me
call
you
as
soon
as
he
had
hung
up
i
wanted
office
to
be
in
on
this
right
from
the
first
beautiful
seductive
nita
selim
almost
cuddling
under
his
arm
within
three
minutes
of
meeting
him
a
vision
of
her
eyes
so
wide
and
luminous
and
wistful
as
they
had
looked
sideways
and
upward
to
his
pleading
for
him
to
join
her
cocktail
party
nearly
made
him
crash
into
a
lumbering
furniture
van
those
eyes
were
luminous
no
longer
could
never
again
snap
the
padlocks
of
slave
chains
upon
any
man
as
penny
had
expressed
it
dead
and
she
had
been
so
warmly
alive
even
as
she
had
retreated
from
him
at
his
mention
of
the
fact
that
he
was
attached
to
the
office
of
the
district
attorney
as
a
special
investigator
what
had
she
feared
then
was
her
death
a
payment
for
some
recent
or
crime
or
had
she
simply
been
withdrawing
from
contamination
with
a
no
she
had
been
horribly
afraid
of
some
ulterior
purpose
behind
his
innocent
courtesy
in
driving
penelope
crain
to
breakaway
inn
well
speculation
now
was
idle
he
told
himself
as
he
noted
that
his
speedometer
had
dropped
from
sixty
to
thirty
in
his
preoccupation
he
speeded
again
but
was
soon
forced
to
stop
and
ask
his
way
into
primrose
meadows
the
vague
directions
of
a
farmer
son
lost
him
nearly
eight
precious
minutes
during
which
his
friend
captain
strawn
of
the
homicide
squad
might
be
bungling
things
rather
badly
but
at
last
he
found
the
ornate
pair
of
pillars
spanned
by
the
painted
legend
primrose
meadows
and
drove
through
them
into
what
soon
became
a
rutted
lane
almost
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
entrance
he
found
the
isolated
house
unmistakable
because
of
the
of
private
cars
parked
before
the
short
stretch
of
paved
sidewalk
and
the
added
presence
of
police
cars
and
motorcycles
dundee
turned
his
own
car
into
the
driveway
leading
from
the
street
along
the
right
side
of
the
house
toward
the
garage
in
the
rear
ahead
of
his
roadster
were
two
other
cars
and
a
glance
toward
the
open
garage
showed
that
a
ford
coupe
was
housed
there
as
he
was
descending
captain
strawn
voice
hailed
him
from
an
open
window
of
the
room
nearest
the
garage
hello
bonnie
been
expecting
you
damnedest
business
you
ever
saw
there
a
door
from
this
room
onto
the
porch
hop
up
and
come
on
in
dundee
obeyed
driving
in
he
had
noted
that
a
wide
porch
upheld
by
round
white
pillars
stretched
across
the
front
of
the
gabled
brick
house
and
extended
halfway
along
its
right
side
past
a
room
which
was
obviously
a
solarium
with
its
continuous
windows
gay
awnings
and
visible
through
the
glittering
panes
wicker
furniture
it
was
easy
to
swing
himself
up
to
the
floor
of
the
porch
strawn
flung
open
the
door
which
led
into
the
back
room
remarking
with
a
grin
do
be
afraid
i
gumming
up
any
fingerprints
carraway
has
already
been
over
the
room
the
selim
woman
bedroom
he
explained
the
room
she
was
killed
in
you
been
on
the
job
dundee
complimented
his
former
chief
sure
strawn
acknowledged
proudly
ca
be
too
quick
on
our
stumps
when
it
one
of
these
sassiety
murders
price
will
be
here
any
minute
now
and
my
men
have
been
all
over
the
premises
basement
to
attic
of
course
it
was
an
outside
job
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
and
we
have
found
a
trace
of
the
murderer
although
selim
had
taken
the
house
furnished
it
was
obvious
that
this
big
bedroom
of
hers
was
not
exactly
as
the
crain
family
had
left
it
a
little
too
pretty
a
little
too
aggressively
feminine
with
its
chaise
longue
heaped
with
silk
and
lace
pillows
its
superfluity
of
big
and
little
lamps
its
bed
draped
with
taffeta
its
dressing
table
but
he
could
not
let
critical
eyes
linger
on
the
vanity
dresser
for
on
the
bench
before
it
sat
a
tiny
figure
the
head
bowed
so
low
that
some
of
the
black
curls
had
fallen
into
a
large
open
bowl
of
powder
she
was
no
longer
wearing
the
brown
silk
summer
coat
whose
open
front
had
given
him
a
glimpse
of
pale
yellow
chiffon
he
saw
the
dress
now
a
sleeveless
fluffy
affair
but
he
really
had
eyes
only
for
the
hole
on
the
left
side
of
the
back
of
the
bodice
about
halfway
between
shoulder
and
waist
a
waist
so
small
he
could
have
spanned
it
with
his
two
hands
including
its
band
of
fuchsia
velvet
ribbon
there
also
had
been
a
bow
of
fuchsia
velvet
ribbon
on
the
lace
and
straw
hat
she
had
swung
so
charmingly
less
than
five
hours
ago
shot
through
the
heart
i
guess
strawn
commented
took
a
good
marksman
to
find
her
heart
shooting
her
through
the
back
funny
thing
too
nobody
heard
the
shot
leastways
none
of
that
crowd
penned
up
in
the
living
room
will
admit
they
did
they
all
hang
together
and
lie
like
sixty
to
keep
us
from
finding
out
anything
that
might
point
to
one
of
precious
bunch
but
if
a
gun
with
a
maxim
silencer
used
as
it
must
have
been
if
that
whole
crew
ai
lying
the
gunman
musta
been
because
you
ca
sight
with
a
maxim
screwed
onto
a
rod
you
know
have
your
men
found
the
gun
dundee
asked
of
course
not
or
i
know
whether
it
had
a
maxim
on
it
or
not
strawn
retorted
my
theory
is
he
added
impressively
that
somebody
with
a
grudge
against
this
dame
hired
a
gunman
to
hang
around
till
he
got
her
dead
to
rights
then
plop
and
he
imitated
the
soft
thudding
sound
made
by
the
discharge
of
a
bullet
from
a
gun
equipped
with
a
silencer
does
it
seem
rather
strange
that
a
professional
gunman
should
have
chosen
such
a
time
with
men
arriving
in
cars
and
the
house
full
of
women
who
might
wander
into
this
room
at
any
minute
to
bump
off
his
victim
dundee
asked
well
there
ai
no
other
explanation
captain
strawn
contended
outside
of
the
fact
that
my
men
have
gone
over
the
whole
house
and
grounds
without
finding
the
gun
i
got
other
evidence
it
was
an
outside
job
look
dundee
followed
the
chief
of
the
homicide
squad
to
one
of
the
two
windows
that
looked
out
upon
the
driveway
both
were
open
since
the
may
day
was
exceptionally
warm
even
for
the
middle
west
the
unscreened
window
from
which
he
obediently
leaned
was
almost
directly
in
line
with
the
vanity
across
the
room
look
see
how
them
vines
have
been
torn
strawn
directed
pointing
to
a
rambler
rose
which
hugged
the
outside
frame
of
the
window
and
look
hard
enough
at
the
flower
bed
down
below
and
you
see
his
footprints
of
course
we
measured
them
and
cain
as
you
see
is
guarding
them
till
my
man
comes
to
make
plaster
casts
of
them
yes
sir
he
hoisted
himself
up
to
the
window
ledge
aimed
as
best
he
could
then
slipped
down
and
beat
it
across
the
meadow
then
dundee
began
slowly
i
wonder
why
selim
did
see
that
figure
crouched
in
the
window
since
she
must
have
been
powdering
her
face
and
looking
into
the
middle
of
the
three
mirrors
the
one
which
reflects
this
very
window
how
do
you
know
she
was
powdering
her
face
not
looking
for
something
in
a
drawer
strawn
demanded
truculently
for
three
reasons
dundee
answered
almost
apologetically
first
her
powder
puff
as
i
sure
you
noticed
is
still
clutched
in
her
right
hand
second
there
is
no
drawer
open
and
no
drawer
open
unless
someone
has
closed
it
since
the
murder
whereas
on
the
other
hand
her
powder
box
open
third
the
left
side
of
her
face
is
unevenly
coated
with
powder
while
the
other
is
heavily
but
powdered
therefore
i
ca
see
why
she
did
scream
or
turn
around
when
she
heard
your
gunman
clambering
up
to
her
window
or
even
when
he
had
crouched
in
it
i
do
see
how
she
could
seeing
him
well
what
do
think
strawn
asked
sourly
after
he
had
tested
the
visibility
of
the
window
from
the
mirror
i
afraid
captain
strawn
that
there
are
only
two
explanations
possible
the
first
of
course
is
that
nita
selim
was
quite
deaf
or
very
nearsighted
i
happen
to
know
from
having
met
her
today
met
her
today
strawn
interrupted
incredulously
dundee
explained
briefly
then
went
on
as
i
was
saying
i
have
good
reason
to
know
she
was
not
deaf
but
i
ca
say
as
to
her
being
nearsighted
except
that
it
is
my
observation
that
people
who
are
extremely
nearsighted
do
not
have
very
wide
eyes
and
no
creases
between
the
brows
i
am
fairly
sure
she
did
not
wear
glasses
at
all
because
glasses
worn
even
a
few
hours
a
day
leave
a
mark
across
the
nose
or
show
pinched
red
spots
on
each
side
of
the
bridge
of
the
nose
you
must
have
had
a
good
hard
look
at
her
strawn
gibed
his
grey
eyes
twinkling
and
his
harsh
mouth
pulling
down
at
one
corner
in
what
he
thought
was
a
genial
smile
i
did
dundee
retorted
well
conceding
that
she
was
neither
deaf
nor
she
would
necessarily
have
heard
and
seen
her
assailant
before
he
shot
her
what
the
other
explanation
strawn
was
becoming
impatient
that
the
person
who
killed
her
was
so
well
known
to
her
and
his
or
her
presence
in
this
room
so
natural
a
thing
that
she
paid
no
attention
to
his
or
her
movements
and
was
concentrating
on
the
job
of
powdering
her
very
pretty
face
you
mean
one
of
that
gang
of
society
folks
in
there
and
strawn
jerked
a
thumb
toward
the
left
side
of
the
house
very
probably
dundee
agreed
but
where
the
gun
strawn
argued
i
tell
you
my
men
this
was
a
premeditated
murder
of
course
dundee
interrupted
the
maxim
silencer
unless
they
are
all
lying
about
not
hearing
a
shot
proves
that
silencers
are
damned
hard
to
get
hold
of
but
people
with
plenty
of
money
can
manage
most
things
and
since
the
murder
was
premeditated
it
is
better
to
count
on
the
fact
that
the
murderer
or
murderess
had
planned
a
pretty
safe
hiding
place
for
the
gun
and
the
silencer
oh
not
necessarily
in
the
house
or
even
near
the
house
he
hastened
to
assure
strawn
who
was
trying
to
break
in
by
the
way
how
long
after
selim
was
killed
was
her
death
discovered
or
do
you
know
i
have
been
able
to
get
much
out
of
that
bunch
in
there
not
even
out
of
penelope
crain
who
ought
to
be
willing
to
help
seeing
as
how
she
works
for
the
district
attorney
but
i
guess
she
waiting
to
spill
it
all
to
you
if
she
knows
anything
so
you
and
sanderson
will
get
all
the
credit
now
look
here
chief
dundee
protested
laying
a
hand
on
shoulder
as
he
reverted
to
the
name
by
which
he
had
addressed
the
head
of
the
homicide
squad
for
nearly
a
year
we
going
to
be
friends
are
we
same
as
always
we
know
pretty
well
how
to
work
together
do
we
no
use
to
begin
pulling
against
each
other
guess
so
strawn
growled
but
he
was
obviously
pleased
and
relieved
maybe
you
better
have
a
crack
at
that
crowd
yourself
i
hear
doc
price
car
always
has
a
bum
spark
plug
i
stick
around
with
him
until
he
gets
going
good
on
his
job
then
if
you
excuse
me
for
butting
in
i
join
your
party
in
the
living
room
and
good
luck
to
you
bonnie
dundee
took
the
door
he
knew
must
lead
into
the
central
hall
but
found
himself
in
an
enclosed
section
of
it
a
small
foyer
between
the
main
hall
and
nita
selim
bedroom
there
was
room
for
a
telephone
table
and
its
chair
as
well
as
for
a
small
sofa
large
enough
for
two
to
sit
upon
comfortably
he
paused
to
open
the
door
across
from
the
telephone
table
and
found
that
it
opened
into
a
closet
whose
hangers
and
hat
forms
now
held
the
outdoor
clothing
belonging
to
nita
guests
nice
clothes
the
smart
but
unostentatious
hats
and
coats
of
moneyed
people
of
good
taste
he
observed
a
little
enviously
before
he
opened
the
door
which
led
into
the
main
hall
which
bisected
the
main
floor
of
the
house
until
it
reached
nita
room
another
door
in
the
section
behind
the
staircase
leading
to
the
gabled
second
story
next
claimed
his
attention
opening
it
he
discovered
a
beautifully
fitted
guests
lavatory
there
was
even
a
fully
appointed
for
women
use
so
that
none
of
her
guests
had
had
the
slightest
excuse
to
invade
the
privacy
of
selim
bedroom
and
bath
unless
specifically
invited
to
do
so
rather
a
well
planned
house
this
dundee
concluded
as
he
closed
the
door
upon
the
green
porcelain
fixtures
and
walked
slowly
toward
the
wide
archway
that
led
from
the
hall
into
a
large
living
room
he
had
a
curious
reluctance
to
intrude
upon
that
assembled
and
guarded
company
of
hamilton
real
society
they
were
all
penny
friends
and
penny
was
friend
but
his
first
swift
glance
about
the
room
reassured
him
no
hysterics
here
these
people
brought
race
and
breeding
even
into
the
presence
of
death
whatever
emotions
had
torn
them
when
nita
body
was
discovered
were
almost
unguessable
now
a
stout
short
woman
of
about
thirty
was
tapping
a
foot
nervously
as
she
talked
to
the
man
who
was
bending
over
her
chair
john
drake
that
was
dundee
had
met
him
knew
him
to
be
a
vice
president
of
the
hamilton
national
bank
in
charge
of
the
trust
department
penelope
crain
was
occupying
half
of
a
with
lois
dunlap
the
hands
of
the
girl
and
of
the
woman
clinging
together
for
mutual
comfort
that
tall
thin
oldish
man
with
the
waxed
grey
mustache
must
be
judge
hugo
marshall
and
the
pretty
girl
leaning
trustingly
against
his
shoulder
must
be
his
wife
karen
marshall
who
had
jumped
at
her
first
proposal
during
her
first
season
yes
people
he
concluded
as
his
eyes
swept
on
and
then
stopped
a
little
bewildered
who
was
man
he
did
belong
somehow
and
his
hands
trembled
visibly
as
he
tried
to
light
a
cigarette
leaning
not
nonchalantly
but
actually
for
support
against
the
brocaded
coral
silk
drapes
of
a
pair
of
wide
long
windows
set
in
the
east
wall
suddenly
dundee
had
it
broadway
this
was
no
hamiltonian
no
comfortably
rich
and
socially
secure
broadway
in
every
line
of
his
clothes
in
the
polished
smoothness
of
his
dark
hair
why
it
dundee
at
last
penny
cried
turning
in
the
seat
before
he
had
time
to
finish
his
mental
inventory
of
the
occupants
she
jumped
to
her
feet
and
threaded
a
swift
way
over
oriental
rugs
and
between
the
two
bridge
tables
still
occupying
the
center
of
the
big
room
still
cluttered
with
score
pads
tally
cards
and
playing
cards
i
been
wondering
if
you
had
stopped
to
have
dinner
first
she
taunted
him
then
laying
a
hand
on
his
arm
she
faced
the
living
room
eagerly
this
is
dundee
folks
special
investigator
attached
to
the
district
attorney
office
and
a
grand
detective
he
solved
the
hogarth
murder
case
you
know
and
the
hillcrest
murder
and
he
friend
so
i
want
you
all
to
trust
him
and
tell
him
things
without
being
afraid
of
him
then
rather
ceremoniously
but
swiftly
she
presented
her
friends
judge
and
hugo
marshall
and
tracey
miles
and
john
drake
dunlap
janet
raymond
polly
beale
clive
hammond
and
at
that
point
penny
hesitated
then
rather
stiffly
included
the
broadway
man
as
dexter
sprague
of
new
york
thank
you
miss
crain
dundee
said
now
will
you
please
tell
me
if
you
know
whether
all
those
invited
to
both
the
bridge
party
and
the
cocktail
party
are
here
penny
face
flamed
ralph
hammond
clive
brother
has
come
yet
i
i
rather
imagine
i
been
up
she
confessed
with
a
faint
attempt
at
gayety
and
ralph
hammond
was
the
man
who
had
once
belonged
rather
exclusively
to
penny
and
who
according
to
her
own
confession
had
succumbed
most
completely
to
nita
selim
charms
dundee
noted
filing
the
reflection
for
further
reference
please
dundee
wo
you
detain
us
as
short
a
time
as
possible
lois
dunlap
asked
as
she
advanced
toward
him
dunlap
is
away
on
a
fishing
trip
and
i
do
like
to
leave
my
three
youngsters
too
long
they
are
really
too
much
of
a
handful
for
the
governess
over
a
period
of
hours
i
shall
detain
all
of
you
no
longer
than
is
absolutely
necessary
dundee
told
her
gently
but
i
am
afraid
i
must
warn
you
that
i
let
you
go
home
very
soon
unless
one
or
more
of
you
has
something
of
vital
importance
to
tell
something
which
will
clear
up
or
materially
help
to
clear
up
this
bad
business
he
paused
a
long
then
asked
curtly
i
am
to
conclude
that
no
one
has
anything
at
all
to
volunteer
there
was
no
answer
other
than
a
barely
perceptible
drawing
together
in
of
the
minds
and
hearts
of
those
who
had
been
friends
for
so
long
very
well
dundee
conceded
abruptly
then
i
must
put
all
of
you
through
a
routine
examination
since
every
one
of
you
is
of
course
a
possible
suspect
chapter
three
dinner
groaned
the
plump
blond
little
man
who
had
been
introduced
as
tracey
miles
as
he
sorrowfully
patted
his
rather
prominent
stomach
do
worry
darling
begged
the
dark
woman
who
was
flora
miles
his
wife
i
sure
dundee
will
ask
lydia
poor
maid
you
know
she
explained
in
an
aside
to
dundee
to
prepare
a
light
supper
for
us
if
he
really
needs
to
detain
us
long
which
i
am
sure
he
wo
how
can
you
think
of
food
now
polly
beale
the
tall
sturdy
girl
with
an
almost
masculine
bob
and
a
quite
masculine
tweed
suit
demanded
brusquely
her
voice
had
an
unfeminine
lack
of
modulation
but
when
dundee
saw
her
glance
toward
clive
hammond
he
realized
that
she
was
wholly
feminine
where
he
was
concerned
at
least
of
course
we
are
all
cut
up
over
poor
nita
death
gasped
a
rather
pretty
girl
whose
most
distinguishing
feature
was
her
crop
of
crinkly
hair
i
assume
that
to
be
true
miss
raymond
dundee
answered
but
we
must
lose
no
more
time
getting
at
the
facts
just
when
was
selim
murdered
at
the
brutal
use
of
the
word
a
shudder
rippled
over
the
small
crowd
dexter
sprague
of
new
york
dropped
his
lighted
cigarette
where
it
would
have
burned
a
hole
in
a
fine
persian
rug
if
sergeant
turner
on
guard
over
the
room
for
captain
strawn
had
not
slouched
from
his
corner
to
plant
a
big
foot
upon
it
we
do
know
exactly
when
it
happened
penny
volunteered
we
were
playing
bridge
the
last
hand
of
the
last
rubber
because
the
men
were
arriving
for
cocktails
when
nita
became
dummy
and
went
to
her
bedroom
to
to
make
herself
for
the
men
drake
mimicked
then
realizing
the
possible
effect
of
her
cattiness
on
dundee
she
defended
herself
volubly
of
course
i
nita
but
she
think
so
terribly
much
about
her
effect
on
men
and
all
that
and
was
always
fixing
her
and
besides
you
suspect
me
because
i
was
playing
against
karen
and
nita
thank
you
drake
dundee
cut
in
does
anyone
know
the
exact
time
selim
left
the
room
when
she
became
dummy
i
can
tell
you
because
i
had
just
arrived
the
first
of
the
men
to
get
here
tracey
miles
volunteered
obviously
glad
of
the
chance
to
talk
a
characteristic
of
the
man
dundee
decided
i
looked
at
my
watch
just
after
i
stepped
out
of
my
car
because
i
like
to
be
on
time
to
the
dot
and
nita
selim
had
said
well
it
was
exactly
so
i
had
five
minutes
to
spare
yes
dundee
speeded
him
up
impatiently
well
i
came
right
into
the
hall
and
hung
my
hat
in
the
closet
out
there
and
then
came
in
here
it
must
have
been
about
by
that
time
he
explained
with
the
meticulousness
of
a
man
on
the
witness
stand
i
shouted
everybody
how
tricks
that
a
joke
you
know
tricks
meaning
tricks
in
bridge
yes
yes
dundee
admitted
frowning
but
the
rest
of
the
company
exchanged
indulgent
smiles
and
flora
miles
patted
her
husband
hand
fondly
well
nita
jumped
up
from
the
bridge
table
that
one
right
there
miles
pointed
to
the
table
nearer
the
arched
doorway
and
she
said
heavens
is
it
half
past
five
already
i
got
to
run
and
make
myself
for
just
such
great
big
men
as
you
tracey
darling
judge
marshall
corrected
with
a
chuckle
that
sounded
odd
in
the
tensely
silent
room
tracey
miles
flushed
a
salmon
pink
and
his
wife
fingers
clutched
at
his
hand
warningly
oh
nita
called
everybody
and
mean
anything
by
it
i
guess
he
explained
uneasily
just
one
of
her
cute
little
ways
well
anyway
she
came
up
to
me
and
straightened
my
necktie
another
one
of
her
funny
little
ways
and
said
my
lamb
wo
you
shake
up
the
cocktails
for
poor
little
nita
you
know
a
sort
of
way
she
had
of
coaxing
people
yes
i
know
dundee
agreed
with
a
trace
of
a
grin
go
on
as
rapidly
as
you
can
please
i
thought
you
wanted
to
know
everything
miles
was
a
little
peevish
he
had
evidently
been
enjoying
himself
of
course
i
said
i
make
the
cocktails
she
said
everything
was
ready
on
the
sideboard
that
the
dining
room
right
behind
this
room
he
explained
unnecessarily
since
the
french
doors
were
open
well
nita
blew
me
a
kiss
from
her
fingertips
and
ran
out
of
the
room
now
let
see
he
ruminated
creasing
his
sunburned
forehead
beneath
his
carefully
combed
blond
hair
that
must
have
been
at
exactly
that
she
left
the
room
i
went
on
into
the
dining
room
and
lois
i
mean
dunlap
came
with
me
because
she
said
she
was
simply
dying
for
a
caviar
sandwich
and
a
nip
of
of
of
scotch
tracey
lois
dunlap
cut
in
grinning
i
sure
dundee
wo
think
i
a
confirmed
tippler
so
you
might
as
well
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
poor
tracey
has
a
deadly
fear
that
we
are
all
going
to
lose
the
last
shred
of
our
reputations
in
this
deplorable
affair
dundee
she
added
in
a
rather
shaky
version
of
the
comfortable
rich
voice
he
had
heard
earlier
in
the
day
i
not
going
to
pry
into
cellars
dundee
assured
her
in
the
same
spirit
what
else
mr
miles
nothing
much
tracey
miles
confessed
with
apparent
regret
i
was
still
mixing
no
i
begun
to
shake
the
cocktails
when
i
heard
a
scream
whose
scream
dundee
demanded
looking
about
the
room
and
dismissing
miles
thankfully
it
was
i
judge
marshall
little
bride
volunteered
in
a
voice
that
threatened
to
rise
to
hysteria
tell
me
all
about
it
dundee
urged
gently
yes
sir
she
quavered
while
her
husband
arm
encircled
her
shoulders
in
courtly
fashion
as
tracey
told
you
nita
was
dummy
and
i
was
declarer
that
is
i
got
the
bid
and
played
the
hand
it
it
was
quite
an
exciting
end
for
me
to
the
afternoon
of
bridge
for
i
not
usually
awfully
lucky
so
when
penny
had
figured
up
the
score
because
i
not
good
at
arithmetic
and
i
knew
nita
and
i
had
rolled
up
an
awfully
big
score
i
jumped
up
and
ran
into
her
room
to
tell
her
the
good
news
because
she
had
come
back
and
and
there
she
was
all
bowed
over
her
and
she
she
was
was
she
was
dead
when
you
reached
her
dundee
assisted
her
yes
karen
marshall
answered
faintly
and
turned
to
hide
her
face
against
her
elderly
husband
breast
dundee
swift
eyes
took
in
the
varying
degrees
of
whiteness
and
sick
horror
that
claimed
every
face
in
the
room
as
surely
as
if
all
present
had
not
already
heard
karen
tell
her
story
to
captain
strawn
tracey
miles
looked
as
if
he
would
have
no
immediate
craving
for
his
dinner
and
judge
marshall
fine
thin
face
no
longer
looked
so
as
he
prided
himself
that
it
did
as
for
dexter
sprague
he
almost
folded
up
against
the
coral
brocade
draperies
it
was
the
women
oddly
enough
who
kept
the
better
control
over
their
emotions
of
course
you
all
rushed
in
when
marshall
screamed
he
asked
casually
twelve
heads
nodded
mutely
did
any
or
all
of
you
touch
the
body
or
things
in
the
room
sprague
touched
her
hair
and
and
lifted
one
of
her
hands
penny
contributed
quietly
but
you
know
how
it
must
have
been
we
ca
any
of
us
tell
every
move
we
made
but
there
was
some
rushing
about
the
men
mostly
looking
for
for
whoever
did
it
marshall
did
you
see
anyone
at
in
or
near
that
room
when
you
entered
it
the
young
wife
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
him
dazedly
with
drowned
blue
eyes
there
was
anyone
in
in
that
room
i
know
she
faltered
it
felt
horrible
being
in
there
with
with
all
alone
but
near
the
room
in
the
main
hall
or
in
the
little
foyer
where
the
telephone
is
dundee
persisted
i
do
think
so
i
ca
remember
seeing
oh
hugo
and
again
she
crouched
against
her
husband
who
soothed
her
with
trembling
hands
that
looked
incongruously
old
against
her
childish
fair
hair
and
face
where
were
the
rest
of
you
where
i
mean
dundee
demanded
conscious
that
captain
strawn
had
entered
the
room
and
was
standing
slightly
behind
him
there
was
such
a
babel
of
answers
given
and
then
hastily
corrected
that
dundee
broke
in
suddenly
i
want
a
connected
story
of
events
leading
up
to
the
tragedy
and
i
want
someone
to
tell
it
who
has
lost
his
or
her
head
at
all
he
looked
about
the
company
as
if
speculatively
but
his
mind
was
already
made
up
miss
crain
will
you
tell
the
story
beginning
with
the
moment
i
left
you
and
dunlap
and
selim
today
penny
nodded
miserably
and
was
about
to
begin
just
a
minute
before
you
begin
miss
crain
dundee
requested
like
to
make
notes
on
your
story
and
he
drew
from
a
coat
pocket
a
shorthand
book
hastily
filched
from
penny
own
tidy
desk
yes
he
answered
the
girl
frank
stare
of
amazement
i
can
write
shorthand
of
a
sort
and
pretty
fast
at
that
though
no
other
human
being
i
am
afraid
could
read
it
but
myself
as
for
you
folks
he
addressed
the
uneasy
silent
group
of
men
and
women
in
dead
nita
living
room
i
shall
ask
you
not
to
interrupt
miss
crain
unless
you
are
very
sure
that
her
memory
is
at
fault
penelope
crain
was
about
to
begin
for
the
second
time
when
again
dundee
interrupted
another
half
second
please
on
the
first
sheet
of
the
new
shorthand
notebook
dundee
scribbled
suggest
you
try
to
locate
ralph
hammond
immediately
very
much
in
love
with
selim
invited
to
cocktail
party
did
not
show
up
tearing
the
sheet
from
the
notebook
he
passed
it
to
captain
strawn
who
read
it
frowning
and
then
nodded
doc
price
has
done
all
he
can
here
strawn
whispered
huskily
wants
to
know
if
you
like
to
speak
to
him
before
he
takes
the
body
to
the
morgue
certainly
dundee
answered
as
he
grinned
apologetically
to
the
girl
who
was
waiting
but
patiently
to
tell
the
story
of
the
afternoon
quickly
suppressed
shudders
and
low
exclamations
of
horror
followed
him
and
the
chief
of
the
homicide
squad
from
the
room
well
bonnie
boy
we
meet
again
for
the
usual
reason
old
price
greeted
the
district
attorney
new
special
investigator
another
shocking
affair
that
a
nice
clean
wound
one
of
the
neatest
jobs
i
ever
saw
shot
entered
the
back
and
penetrated
the
heart
nicely
calculated
if
the
bullet
had
struck
a
quarter
of
an
inch
higher
it
would
have
been
deflected
by
the
but
the
of
the
bullet
doctor
dundee
broke
in
have
you
made
any
calculations
as
to
the
place
and
distance
at
which
the
shot
was
fired
roughly
speaking
yes
the
coroner
answered
the
gun
was
fired
at
a
distance
probably
of
ten
or
fifteen
feet
perhaps
closer
but
i
think
so
he
amended
meticulously
as
for
the
path
of
the
bullet
i
have
fixed
it
judging
from
the
position
of
the
body
which
i
am
assured
had
not
been
moved
before
my
arrival
as
coming
from
a
point
somewhere
along
a
straight
line
drawn
from
the
wound
with
the
body
upright
of
course
to
here
dundee
and
strawn
followed
the
brisk
little
old
doctor
across
the
bedroom
to
a
window
opening
upon
the
drive
the
one
nearest
the
door
leading
out
upon
the
porch
i
marked
the
end
of
the
line
here
price
went
on
pointing
to
a
faint
pencil
mark
made
upon
the
window
frame
the
strip
of
woodwork
near
the
chaise
longue
which
was
set
between
the
two
windows
i
told
you
she
was
shot
from
the
window
strawn
reminded
dundee
triumphantly
you
see
doc
it
my
theory
that
the
murderer
climbed
up
to
the
sill
of
this
window
which
was
open
as
it
is
now
crouched
in
it
and
shot
her
while
she
sat
there
powdering
her
face
not
necessarily
captain
not
necessarily
price
deprecated
i
merely
say
that
this
pencil
mark
indicated
the
of
the
line
showing
the
path
of
the
bullet
certainly
she
was
not
shot
the
frame
of
the
window
but
she
might
have
been
shot
by
anyone
stationed
just
in
front
of
it
or
anywhere
along
the
line
up
to
say
within
ten
feet
of
the
woman
now
if
that
all
captain
i
be
getting
this
corpse
into
the
morgue
for
an
autopsy
and
i
send
you
both
a
copy
of
my
findings
just
a
minute
price
dundee
detained
him
how
old
would
you
say
selim
was
the
little
doctor
pursed
his
wrinkled
lips
and
considered
for
a
moment
eyeing
the
body
stretched
upon
the
chaise
longue
speculatively
between
thirty
and
years
old
he
answered
finally
of
course
you
understand
that
that
estimate
is
unofficial
and
must
remain
so
until
i
have
completed
the
autopsy
dundee
stared
down
at
the
upturned
face
of
the
dead
woman
with
startled
incredulity
between
thirty
and
years
old
that
tiny
lovely
but
she
was
not
quite
so
lovely
in
death
in
spite
of
the
serenity
it
had
brought
to
those
features
peering
more
closely
he
could
see
without
those
luminous
wide
eyes
to
center
his
attention
numerous
fine
lines
on
the
waxen
face
the
slackness
of
a
little
pouch
of
soft
flesh
beneath
her
round
chin
an
occasional
white
hair
among
the
dark
curls
dundee
sighed
how
easy
it
was
for
a
beautiful
woman
to
deceive
men
with
a
pair
of
wide
velvety
black
eyes
but
he
bet
the
women
had
not
been
quite
so
thoroughly
taken
in
by
her
cuddly
childishness
her
odd
mixture
of
demureness
and
youthful
impudence
back
in
the
living
room
whose
occupants
stopped
whispering
and
grew
taut
with
suspense
dundee
seated
himself
at
a
little
table
notebook
spread
while
strawn
settled
himself
heavily
in
the
nearest
overstuffed
armchair
now
miss
crain
i
am
quite
ready
if
you
will
forgive
me
for
having
kept
you
waiting
in
a
very
quiet
voice
slightly
husky
as
always
penny
began
her
story
i
think
it
lacked
two
or
three
minutes
of
one
when
you
drove
away
nita
lois
do
you
mind
if
i
use
the
names
i
am
most
accustomed
to
thank
you
and
i
went
immediately
into
the
lounge
of
breakaway
inn
where
we
found
carolyn
drake
and
flora
miles
waiting
for
us
nita
soon
left
us
to
see
about
the
arrangement
of
the
table
and
while
she
was
away
the
rest
of
the
girls
arrived
except
a
woman
voice
broke
in
i
was
going
to
say
all
eight
of
us
were
ready
for
lunch
except
polly
beale
she
had
come
penny
went
on
her
husky
voice
a
little
sharp
with
annoyance
when
nita
came
to
ask
us
into
the
private
dining
room
one
of
the
inn
employees
came
and
told
her
there
was
a
call
for
her
and
showed
her
to
the
private
booth
in
the
lounge
in
a
minute
nita
returned
and
told
us
that
polly
was
coming
to
the
luncheon
but
would
join
us
later
for
bridge
here
why
do
you
tell
him
how
funny
nita
acted
janet
raymond
prompted
penny
flushed
but
she
accepted
the
prompting
i
think
any
of
us
might
have
been
a
little
annoyed
she
said
steadily
as
if
striving
to
be
utterly
truthful
nita
told
us
she
turned
to
dundee
whose
pencil
was
flying
that
polly
had
made
no
excuse
at
all
in
fact
she
quoted
polly
exactly
nita
ca
make
it
for
lunch
i
show
up
at
your
place
at
for
bridge
nita
could
bear
the
least
hint
of
being
slighted
janet
raymond
explained
with
a
malicious
gleam
in
her
pale
blue
eyes
if
it
been
for
lois
and
hugo
judge
marshall
i
mean
nita
selim
would
never
have
been
included
in
any
of
our
affairs
and
she
it
the
dunlaps
can
do
anything
they
please
because
they
please
janet
lois
dunlap
cut
in
her
usually
placid
voice
becoming
quite
sharp
you
must
know
by
this
time
that
i
make
friends
wherever
i
please
and
that
i
liked
yes
i
was
fond
of
poor
little
nita
in
fact
i
am
forced
to
believe
that
of
all
the
women
she
met
in
this
town
i
was
her
only
real
friend
there
was
a
flush
of
anger
on
her
lovably
plain
face
as
her
grey
eyes
challenged
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
forsyte
girls
one
or
two
looked
a
little
ashamed
but
there
was
not
a
single
voice
to
contradict
lois
dunlap
flat
assertion
will
you
please
go
on
pen
miss
crain
dundee
urged
but
he
had
missed
nothing
of
the
little
i
wish
you
would
call
me
penny
so
i
feel
more
like
a
person
than
a
witness
penny
retorted
thornily
where
was
i
oh
yes
nita
cooled
right
off
when
lois
reminded
her
that
polly
was
always
abrupt
like
that
and
here
penny
paused
to
grin
apologetically
at
the
girl
with
the
haircut
and
then
we
all
went
into
the
private
dining
room
where
nita
had
ordered
a
perfectly
gorgeous
lunch
with
a
heavenly
centerpiece
of
yellow
orchids
well
i
suppose
you
interested
in
what
we
ate
and
things
like
that
she
hesitated
was
there
anything
unusual
in
the
conversation
anything
like
a
quarrel
dundee
prompted
oh
no
penny
protested
nothing
happened
out
of
the
ordinary
at
all
no
wait
nita
received
a
letter
by
messenger
or
rather
a
note
when
we
were
about
half
through
luncheon
there
was
a
low
cry
from
someone
who
had
uttered
it
dundee
could
not
be
sure
since
his
eyes
had
been
on
his
notebook
but
what
had
really
interrupted
penny
crain
was
a
crash
chapter
four
pardon
awfully
sorry
clive
hammond
muttered
as
he
bent
to
pick
up
the
fragments
of
a
colored
pottery
ashtray
which
he
and
his
fiancée
polly
beale
had
been
sharing
do
worry
about
picking
it
up
polly
commanded
in
her
brusque
voice
but
dundee
listening
acutely
was
sure
of
a
very
slight
pause
between
the
two
parts
of
her
sentence
he
glanced
at
the
couple
the
tall
girl
lounging
deep
in
an
armchair
clive
hammond
rather
unusually
with
his
hair
brown
eyes
and
a
face
and
body
as
compactly
and
symmetrically
designed
as
one
of
the
buildings
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
dundee
as
the
product
of
the
young
architect
genius
now
resuming
his
seat
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
his
chief
concern
seemed
to
be
for
another
ashtray
which
sergeant
turner
with
a
grin
produced
from
one
of
the
many
little
tables
with
which
the
room
was
provided
rather
strange
that
those
two
should
be
engaged
dundee
mused
go
on
miss
crain
the
detective
urged
as
if
he
were
impatient
of
the
delay
about
that
note
or
letter
it
was
in
a
envelope
with
printing
or
engraving
in
the
upper
corner
penny
went
on
half
closing
her
eyes
to
recapture
the
scene
in
its
entirety
like
business
firms
use
she
amended
i
could
help
seeing
since
i
sat
so
near
nita
she
seemed
startled
or
well
maybe
i
better
say
surprised
and
a
little
sore
but
she
tore
it
open
and
read
it
at
a
glance
almost
which
is
why
i
say
it
must
have
been
only
a
note
but
while
she
was
reading
it
she
frowned
then
smiled
as
if
something
had
amused
or
or
she
smiled
like
any
woman
reading
a
love
letter
carolyn
drake
interrupted
positively
i
myself
was
sure
that
one
of
her
admirers
had
broken
an
engagement
but
had
signed
himself
all
my
love
darling
your
own
dundee
wondered
if
even
carolyn
drake
husband
the
carefully
groomed
and
dignified
john
drake
bank
had
ever
sent
such
a
note
but
he
did
not
let
his
pencil
slow
down
for
penny
was
talking
again
i
think
you
are
assuming
a
little
too
much
carolyn
but
let
that
pass
at
any
rate
nita
did
say
a
word
about
the
contents
of
the
note
and
naturally
no
one
asked
a
question
she
simply
tucked
it
into
the
pocket
of
her
silk
summer
coat
which
was
draped
over
the
back
of
her
chair
and
the
luncheon
went
on
then
we
all
drove
over
here
and
found
polly
waiting
in
her
own
coupe
in
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
she
told
nita
she
had
rung
the
bell
but
the
maid
lydia
did
answer
so
she
had
just
waited
nita
did
seem
surprised
said
she
had
a
key
if
lydia
had
come
back
yet
you
see
she
interrupted
herself
to
explain
to
dundee
nita
had
already
told
us
at
luncheon
that
darling
lydia
as
she
called
her
had
had
to
go
in
to
town
to
get
an
abscessed
tooth
extracted
and
was
to
wait
in
the
dentist
office
until
she
felt
equal
to
driving
herself
home
again
in
nita
coupe
yes
nita
had
taken
her
in
herself
she
answered
the
beginning
of
a
question
from
dundee
at
what
time
dundee
queried
i
do
know
exactly
but
nita
said
she
had
to
dash
away
at
an
ungodly
hour
so
that
lydia
could
make
her
ten
appointment
and
so
that
she
herself
could
get
a
manicure
and
a
shampoo
and
have
her
hair
dressed
so
i
imagine
she
must
have
left
not
later
than
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
to
ten
how
did
selim
get
out
to
breakaway
inn
if
she
left
her
own
car
with
the
maid
you
saw
her
arrive
with
lois
penny
reminded
him
nita
had
told
us
all
about
lydia
dentist
appointment
when
she
was
at
my
house
for
dinner
wednesday
night
lois
dunlap
contributed
i
offered
to
call
for
her
anywhere
she
said
and
take
her
out
to
breakaway
inn
in
my
car
today
i
met
her
at
her
suggestion
in
the
french
hat
salon
of
the
shop
where
she
got
her
shampoo
and
manicure
department
store
a
large
dinner
party
mrs
dunlap
dundee
asked
not
large
at
all
just
twelve
of
us
the
crowd
here
except
for
sprague
penny
and
janet
who
was
selim
dinner
partner
dundee
asked
that
right
he
here
lois
dunlap
corrected
herself
ralph
hammond
brought
her
and
was
her
dinner
partner
thank
you
now
penny
you
were
saying
the
maid
had
not
returned
oh
but
she
had
penny
answered
impatiently
if
i
going
to
be
interrupted
so
much
well
nita
rang
the
bell
and
lydia
came
tying
on
her
apron
nita
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
that
was
swollen
and
asked
her
why
she
had
let
polly
in
and
lydia
said
she
had
heard
the
bell
because
she
had
dropped
asleep
in
her
room
in
the
basement
dopey
from
the
local
anesthetic
you
know
she
explained
to
dundee
i
see
dundee
acknowledged
and
underlined
heavily
another
note
in
his
scrawled
shorthand
so
lydia
took
our
hats
and
summer
coats
and
put
them
in
the
hall
closet
and
then
followed
nita
who
was
calling
to
her
on
into
bedroom
we
thought
she
either
wanted
to
give
directions
about
the
makings
for
the
cocktails
and
the
sandwiches
or
to
console
poor
lydia
for
the
awful
pain
she
had
had
at
the
dentist
so
we
did
intrude
we
made
a
dive
for
the
bridge
tables
found
our
places
and
were
ready
to
play
when
nita
joined
us
nita
and
karen
just
a
minute
penny
did
any
of
you
then
or
later
until
marshall
discovered
the
tragedy
go
into
selim
bedroom
there
was
no
need
for
us
to
penny
told
him
there
a
lavatory
with
a
right
behind
the
staircase
i
for
one
did
go
into
nita
room
until
after
karen
screamed
there
was
a
chorus
of
similar
denials
on
the
part
of
every
woman
present
at
dundee
significant
pressing
of
the
same
question
upon
the
men
he
was
met
with
either
laconic
negatives
or
sharply
indignant
ones
all
right
penny
go
ahead
please
i
was
going
to
tell
you
how
we
were
seated
for
bridge
if
that
interests
you
penny
said
rather
tartly
it
interests
me
intensely
dundee
assured
her
smiling
then
it
was
this
way
began
penny
thawing
instantly
karen
and
nita
carolyn
and
i
were
at
this
table
and
she
pointed
to
the
table
nearer
the
hall
flora
polly
janet
and
lois
were
at
the
other
we
played
at
those
tables
all
afternoon
we
simply
pivoted
at
our
own
table
after
the
end
of
each
rubber
when
nita
became
dummy
forgive
me
dundee
begged
as
he
interrupted
her
again
i
like
to
ask
a
question
dunlap
since
you
were
at
the
other
table
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
what
your
partner
and
opponents
were
doing
just
before
selim
became
dummy
lois
dunlap
pressed
her
fingertips
into
her
temples
as
if
in
an
effort
to
remember
clearly
it
rather
hard
to
think
of
bridge
now
dundee
she
said
at
last
but
yes
of
course
i
remember
we
had
finished
a
rubber
and
had
decided
there
would
be
no
time
for
another
since
it
was
so
near
that
last
rubber
please
dunlap
dundee
suggested
who
were
partners
and
just
when
was
it
finished
flora
lois
turned
toward
mrs
miles
who
had
sat
with
her
hands
tightly
locked
and
her
great
haggard
dark
eyes
roving
tensely
from
one
to
another
you
and
i
were
partners
were
we
of
course
remember
you
were
dummy
and
i
played
the
hand
you
went
out
to
telephone
you
that
right
i
remember
clearly
now
flora
said
she
had
to
telephone
the
house
to
ask
how
her
two
babies
six
and
four
years
old
they
are
dundee
and
the
rosiest
dumplings
well
anyway
flora
went
to
telephone
in
the
little
foyer
between
the
main
hall
and
selim
room
yes
of
course
lois
dunlap
answered
but
dundee
eyes
were
upon
flora
miles
and
he
saw
her
naturally
sallow
face
go
yellow
under
its
rouge
i
played
the
hand
and
made
my
bid
although
flora
and
i
had
gone
down
on
the
hand
before
lois
continued
with
a
rueful
twinkle
of
her
pleasant
grey
eyes
when
the
score
was
totted
up
i
found
i
won
a
bit
after
all
our
winnings
go
to
the
forsyte
alumnae
scholarship
fund
she
explained
yes
i
know
dundee
nodded
and
then
polly
asked
the
other
table
how
they
stood
and
nita
said
game
to
go
on
this
rubber
provided
we
make
it
karen
was
dealing
the
cards
then
and
nita
was
looking
very
happy
she
been
winning
pretty
steadily
i
think
pardon
dunlap
how
did
the
players
at
your
table
dispose
of
themselves
then
that
is
immediately
after
you
had
finished
playing
the
last
hand
and
marshall
was
dealing
at
the
other
table
lois
screwed
up
her
forehead
let
me
think
i
know
what
did
i
went
over
to
watch
the
game
at
the
other
table
and
stayed
there
till
tracey
mr
miles
came
in
for
cocktails
i
ca
tell
you
exactly
what
the
other
three
did
there
was
a
strained
silence
dundee
saw
polly
scale
hand
tighten
convulsively
on
clive
hammond
saw
janet
raymond
flush
scarlet
watched
a
muscle
jerk
in
flora
miles
otherwise
rigid
face
suddenly
he
sprang
to
his
feet
i
am
going
to
make
what
will
seem
an
absurd
request
he
said
tensely
i
am
going
to
ask
you
all
the
women
i
mean
to
take
your
places
at
the
bridge
tables
and
then
he
paused
for
an
instant
his
blue
eyes
hard
i
want
to
see
the
death
hand
played
exactly
as
it
was
played
while
nita
selim
was
being
murdered
chapter
five
shame
on
you
bonnie
dundee
cried
penny
crain
her
small
fists
clenched
belligerently
hand
indeed
you
talk
like
a
new
york
tabloid
and
if
you
do
realize
that
all
of
us
have
stood
pretty
nearly
as
much
as
we
can
without
having
to
play
the
hand
at
bridge
the
hand
we
played
while
nita
selim
was
being
murdered
then
you
have
the
decency
and
human
feelings
i
credited
you
with
a
murmur
of
indignant
approval
accompanied
her
tirade
and
buzzed
on
for
a
moment
after
she
had
finished
but
it
ceased
abruptly
as
dundee
spoke
who
conducting
this
investigation
penny
crain
you
or
i
you
will
kindly
let
me
do
it
in
my
own
fashion
and
try
to
be
content
when
i
tell
you
that
in
my
humble
opinion
what
i
propose
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
solution
of
this
case
bickering
dundee
grinned
to
himself
exactly
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
always
had
quarreled
and
made
up
with
fierce
intensity
for
years
really
dundee
judge
hugo
marshall
began
pompously
embracing
his
young
wife
protectingly
i
must
say
that
i
agree
with
miss
crain
this
is
an
outrage
sir
an
outrage
to
all
of
us
and
particularly
to
this
frail
little
wife
of
mine
already
over
the
ordeal
she
has
endured
take
your
places
dundee
ordered
curtly
after
all
there
was
a
limit
to
the
careful
courtesy
one
must
show
to
hamilton
inmost
circle
of
society
penny
led
the
way
to
the
bridge
tables
the
very
waves
of
her
brown
bob
seeming
to
bristle
with
futile
anger
but
she
obeyed
dundee
exulted
the
way
to
tame
this
blessed
little
shrew
had
been
solved
by
old
bill
shakespeare
centuries
ago
as
the
women
took
their
places
at
the
two
tables
arguing
a
bit
among
themselves
with
edges
to
their
voices
dundee
watched
the
men
but
all
of
them
with
the
exception
of
dexter
sprague
that
typical
son
of
broadway
so
out
of
place
in
this
company
had
managed
at
least
a
fine
surface
control
their
lips
tight
their
eyes
hard
narrowed
and
watchful
sprague
slumped
into
a
vacated
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
revealing
yellowish
lids
where
shall
we
begin
polly
beale
demanded
brusquely
remember
this
table
had
finished
playing
when
karen
began
to
deal
what
you
call
the
hand
she
reminded
him
scornfully
and
flora
was
here
at
all
she
had
been
dummy
for
our
last
hand
and
had
gone
out
to
telephone
dundee
interrupted
mrs
miles
will
you
please
leave
the
room
and
return
exactly
when
you
did
return
or
as
nearly
so
as
you
can
remember
dundee
was
sure
that
mrs
miles
sallow
face
took
on
a
greyish
tinge
as
she
staggered
to
her
feet
and
wound
an
uncertain
way
toward
the
hall
tracey
miles
sprang
to
his
wife
assistance
but
sergeant
turner
took
it
upon
himself
to
lay
a
detaining
hand
on
the
arm
with
no
more
than
the
lifting
of
an
eyebrow
dundee
made
captain
strawn
understand
that
flora
miles
movements
were
to
be
kept
under
strict
observation
and
the
chief
of
the
homicide
squad
as
unobtrusively
conveyed
the
order
to
a
plainclothesman
loitering
interestedly
in
the
wide
doorway
now
he
was
answering
polly
beale
question
i
should
like
the
remaining
three
of
you
to
behave
exactly
as
you
did
when
your
last
hand
was
finished
did
you
keep
individual
score
as
is
customary
in
contract
or
were
you
playing
auction
contract
polly
beale
answered
curtly
and
when
we
playing
among
ourselves
like
this
one
at
each
table
is
usually
elected
to
keep
score
janet
was
for
us
this
afternoon
but
we
all
waited
after
our
last
hand
was
played
for
janet
to
give
us
the
result
for
our
tally
cards
dundee
drew
near
the
table
picked
up
the
three
tally
cards
ornamental
little
affairs
and
rather
expensive
glanced
over
the
points
recorded
then
asked
abruptly
where
is
mrs
miles
tally
i
do
see
it
here
there
was
no
answer
to
be
had
so
he
let
the
matter
drop
temporarily
though
his
shorthand
notebook
received
another
deeply
underlined
series
of
pothooks
go
on
please
at
both
tables
dundee
commanded
your
table
he
nodded
toward
penny
who
was
already
over
her
flare
of
temper
will
please
select
the
cards
each
held
at
the
conclusion
of
deal
oooh
i
never
remember
my
cards
in
the
world
carolyn
drake
wailed
i
know
i
had
five
clubs
ace
king
queen
you
had
the
jack
not
the
queen
for
i
held
it
myself
penny
contradicted
her
crisply
until
this
matter
of
who
held
which
cards
after
marshall
deal
is
settled
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
all
to
remain
as
you
are
now
dundee
said
to
the
players
seated
at
the
other
table
at
last
it
was
threshed
out
largely
between
penny
crain
and
karen
marshall
the
latter
proving
to
have
a
better
memory
than
dundee
had
expected
at
last
even
carolyn
drake
querulous
fussiness
was
satisfied
or
trampled
down
both
judge
marshall
and
john
drake
started
forward
to
inspect
the
cards
which
none
of
the
players
was
trying
to
conceal
but
dundee
waved
them
back
please
i
want
you
men
all
of
you
to
take
your
places
outside
and
return
to
this
room
in
the
order
of
your
arrival
this
afternoon
try
to
imagine
that
it
is
now
if
i
can
trust
mr
miles
apparently
excellent
memory
exactly
pretty
hard
to
do
considering
it
now
a
quarter
past
seven
and
there
still
no
dinner
in
sight
tracey
miles
grumbled
then
brightened
i
can
come
right
back
in
then
at
ca
i
that
point
settled
and
the
men
sent
away
to
be
watched
by
several
pairs
of
apparently
indolent
police
eyes
dundee
turned
to
the
bridge
table
nita
leaving
of
which
had
provided
her
murderer
with
his
opportunity
the
cards
are
penny
reminded
him
now
i
want
you
other
three
to
scatter
exactly
as
you
did
before
dundee
commanded
hurry
and
excitement
in
his
voice
lois
dunlap
rose
laid
down
her
tally
card
and
strolled
over
to
the
remaining
table
after
a
moment
hesitation
polly
beale
strode
mannishly
out
of
the
room
straight
into
the
hall
dundee
watching
as
the
bridge
players
earlier
that
afternoon
certainly
had
not
was
amazed
to
see
clive
hammond
beckoning
to
her
from
the
open
door
of
the
solarium
so
clive
hammond
had
arrived
ahead
of
tracey
miles
had
somehow
entered
the
solarium
unnoticed
and
had
managed
to
beckon
his
fiancée
to
join
him
there
prearranged
and
why
had
clive
hammond
failed
to
enter
and
greet
his
hostess
first
moreover
had
he
entered
the
solarium
but
things
were
happening
in
the
living
room
janet
raymond
flushing
so
that
her
sunburned
face
outdid
her
red
hair
for
vividness
was
slowly
leaving
the
room
also
through
a
window
opening
upon
the
wide
front
porch
dundee
saw
the
girl
take
her
position
against
a
pillar
then
a
thing
she
had
not
done
before
very
probably
press
her
handkerchief
to
her
trembling
lips
but
the
bidding
was
going
on
karen
marshall
piping
in
her
childish
treble
three
spades
dundee
took
his
place
behind
her
chair
then
silently
beckoned
to
penny
to
shift
from
her
own
chair
opposite
carolyn
drake
to
the
chair
nita
selim
had
left
to
go
to
her
death
she
nodded
understandingly
double
quavered
carolyn
drake
next
on
the
left
to
the
dealer
and
managed
to
raise
her
eyebrows
meaningly
to
penny
her
partner
who
had
not
yet
changed
places
penny
throwing
herself
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
scowled
warningly
no
exchanging
of
illicit
signals
for
penny
crain
but
the
instant
she
slipped
into
nita
selim
chair
her
whole
face
and
body
took
on
a
different
manner
underwent
almost
a
physical
change
she
nita
selim
now
she
tucked
her
head
considered
her
cards
laughed
a
little
breathless
note
then
cried
triumphantly
and
i
say
what
do
you
think
of
partner
then
the
girl
who
was
giving
an
amazing
imitation
of
nita
selim
changed
as
suddenly
into
her
own
character
as
she
changed
chairs
nita
i
do
think
it
quite
hoyle
to
be
so
jubilant
about
the
strength
of
your
hand
she
commented
tartly
i
pass
karen
marshall
pretended
to
study
her
hand
for
a
frowning
instant
then
under
penny
spell
announced
with
a
pretty
air
of
bravado
six
spades
your
raise
to
five
makes
a
little
slam
obligatory
does
it
nita
carolyn
drake
flushed
and
looked
uneasily
toward
penny
a
bit
of
which
dundee
could
see
had
not
figured
in
the
original
game
but
she
bridled
and
shifted
her
plump
body
in
her
chair
as
she
must
have
done
before
i
double
a
little
slam
she
declared
then
still
acting
the
role
she
had
played
in
earnest
that
afternoon
she
explained
importantly
i
always
double
a
little
slam
on
principle
penny
in
the
role
of
nita
redoubled
with
an
exultant
laugh
then
as
herself
said
pass
with
a
murderous
glance
at
drake
let
see
your
hand
partner
karen
quavered
addressing
a
woman
who
had
been
dead
nearly
two
hours
then
she
shuddered
oh
this
is
too
horrible
as
penny
crain
again
slipped
into
nita
selim
chair
and
prepared
to
lay
down
the
dummy
hand
and
it
horrible
even
if
vitally
necessary
for
these
three
to
have
to
go
through
the
farce
of
playing
a
bridge
hand
while
one
of
the
original
players
was
lying
on
a
marble
slab
at
the
morgue
her
cold
flesh
insensible
to
the
coroner
expert
knife
but
dundee
said
nothing
for
tracey
miles
was
already
hovering
in
the
doorway
ready
for
his
cue
to
enter
penny
or
rather
nita
was
saying
how
karen
darling
as
she
laid
down
the
ace
and
deuce
of
spades
karen
trumps
i
hope
you
remember
are
vulnerable
as
well
as
we
carolyn
remarked
in
a
sorry
imitation
of
her
original
cocksureness
as
she
opened
the
play
by
leading
the
ace
of
clubs
and
how
partner
a
singleton
in
clubs
nita
imitator
demanded
triumphantly
as
she
continued
to
lay
down
her
dummy
hand
slapping
the
lone
nine
of
clubs
down
beside
trumps
and
this
little
collection
of
hearts
as
she
displayed
and
arranged
the
king
jack
eight
and
four
of
hearts
this
as
a
length
of
diamonds
ace
jack
ten
eight
seven
and
six
slithered
down
the
glossy
linen
cover
of
the
bridge
table
toward
karen
marshall
now
if
you
do
make
your
little
slam
infant
do
dare
say
i
should
have
jumped
you
to
five
i
figured
you
for
a
blank
or
a
singleton
in
diamonds
and
at
least
the
ace
of
hearts
or
you
cautious
as
you
are
would
have
made
an
original
three
spade
bid
without
the
ace
hop
to
it
darling
this
is
where
i
enter
tracey
miles
whispered
to
dundee
and
at
a
nod
from
the
young
detective
the
pudgy
little
blond
man
strode
jauntily
into
the
living
room
proud
of
himself
in
the
role
of
actor
hello
everybody
how
tricks
he
called
genially
but
there
was
a
quiver
of
horror
in
his
voice
under
its
blitheness
penny
was
quite
pale
when
she
sprang
from
her
chair
but
her
voice
seemed
to
be
nita
very
own
as
she
sang
out
it
be
already
thank
heaven
i
dummy
and
can
run
away
and
make
myself
for
you
and
all
the
other
great
big
men
tracey
darling
dundee
keen
memory
registered
the
slight
difference
in
the
wording
of
the
greeting
as
reported
by
this
and
the
man
she
was
running
to
meet
but
penny
as
nita
was
already
straightening
tracey
necktie
with
possessive
coquettish
fingers
was
coaxing
with
head
tucked
alluringly
tracey
my
ownest
lamb
wo
you
shake
up
the
cocktails
for
nita
the
makings
are
all
on
the
sideboard
or
i
do
know
my
precious
old
lydia
even
if
her
poor
jaw
does
ache
most
horribly
then
penny
as
nita
was
on
her
way
pausing
in
the
doorway
to
blow
a
kiss
from
her
fingertips
to
the
fatuously
grinning
but
now
quite
pale
tracey
miles
she
was
out
of
sight
for
only
an
instant
then
reappeared
and
very
quietly
retraced
her
steps
to
the
bridge
table
unobtrusively
dundee
drew
his
watch
from
his
pocket
palmed
it
as
he
noted
the
exact
minute
then
commanded
curtly
on
with
the
game
as
tracey
miles
passed
the
first
bridge
table
lois
dunlap
linked
her
arm
in
his
saying
in
a
voice
she
tried
to
make
gay
and
natural
i
trailing
along
tracey
simply
dying
for
a
nip
of
scotch
nita
is
the
real
stuff
which
is
more
than
my
fussy
old
pete
can
get
half
the
time
and
you
know
i
loathe
cocktails
the
two
passed
on
into
the
dining
room
the
players
scarcely
raising
their
eyes
from
their
cards
which
they
held
as
if
the
game
were
real
dundee
his
watch
still
in
his
hand
advanced
to
the
bridge
table
strolling
from
player
to
player
he
made
mental
photographs
of
each
hand
then
took
his
stand
behind
penny
chair
to
observe
the
horribly
farcical
playing
of
it
poor
little
penny
he
reflected
she
had
had
a
chance
against
that
across
the
table
from
her
fancy
anyone
doubling
a
little
slam
bid
on
a
hand
like
carolyn
drake
or
even
calling
an
informatory
double
in
the
first
place
why
had
she
bid
four
clubs
after
karen
original
three
spade
bid
if
she
simply
wanted
to
give
her
partner
information
not
that
she
really
had
a
bid
karen
hand
trembled
as
she
drew
the
lone
nine
of
clubs
from
the
dummy
to
place
beside
carolyn
ace
but
penny
fingers
were
quite
steady
as
she
followed
with
the
deuce
of
clubs
to
which
karen
added
with
a
trace
of
characteristic
uncertainty
the
eight
there
our
book
carolyn
drake
exulted
obediently
but
she
cast
an
apologetic
glance
toward
penny
if
we
take
one
more
trick
we
set
them
fat
chance
penny
obligingly
responded
and
dundee
relieved
knew
that
the
farcical
game
would
now
be
played
almost
exactly
and
with
the
same
comments
as
it
had
been
played
while
nita
selim
was
being
murdered
thanks
to
penny
crain
with
a
shamefaced
glance
upward
at
dundee
carolyn
drake
then
led
the
deuce
of
diamonds
committing
the
gross
tactical
error
of
leading
from
the
queen
karen
added
the
jack
from
the
dummy
and
penny
shruggingly
contributed
her
king
to
find
the
trick
as
she
had
suspected
in
the
original
game
trumped
by
the
five
of
spades
since
karen
had
no
diamonds
so
settles
carolyn
penny
commented
acidly
her
partner
rose
to
the
role
she
was
playing
well
as
i
said
i
always
double
a
little
slam
on
principle
besides
how
could
i
know
they
would
have
a
chance
for
in
clubs
and
diamonds
i
thought
you
would
at
least
hold
the
ace
of
diamonds
and
that
karen
would
certainly
have
one
as
i
only
had
four
penny
shrugged
oh
well
let
play
bridge
for
karen
was
staring
at
her
cards
helplessly
sorry
karen
i
realize
a
post
mortem
is
usually
held
after
the
playing
of
a
hand
not
before
i
i
guess
i
better
get
my
trumps
out
karen
now
almost
a
genuine
actress
too
breathed
tremulously
i
wish
nita
were
playing
this
hand
i
know
i
muff
it
somehow
good
kid
dundee
commented
silently
and
allowed
himself
the
liberty
of
patting
karen
on
her
slim
shoulder
the
girl
threw
an
upward
glance
of
gratitude
through
misty
eyes
then
led
the
six
of
spades
drake
contributing
the
four
dummy
taking
the
trick
with
the
ace
and
penny
relinquishing
the
three
let
see
that
makes
five
of
in
since
i
trumped
one
trick
karen
said
as
she
reached
across
the
table
to
lead
from
dummy
as
if
the
words
were
a
cue
which
they
probably
were
judge
marshall
entered
the
room
at
that
moment
making
a
great
effort
to
be
as
jaunty
debonair
and
young
for
his
age
as
he
must
have
thought
he
looked
when
he
made
his
entrance
when
the
real
game
was
being
played
at
his
step
karen
lifted
her
head
and
greeted
her
elderly
husband
with
a
curious
mixture
of
childlike
joy
and
womanly
tenderness
hullo
darling
i
trying
to
make
a
little
slam
i
may
have
been
foolish
to
bid
but
nita
jumped
me
from
three
to
five
spades
let
have
a
look
sweetheart
the
retired
judge
suggested
pompously
and
dundee
gave
way
to
make
room
for
him
behind
karen
chair
but
before
judge
marshall
looked
at
his
wife
cards
he
bent
and
kissed
her
on
her
flushed
cheek
and
karen
raised
a
trembling
hand
to
tweak
his
grey
mustache
dundee
with
uplifted
eyebrow
queried
penny
who
nodded
shortly
conveying
the
information
that
this
was
the
way
the
scene
had
really
been
played
when
there
was
no
question
of
acting
i
getting
out
my
trumps
darling
karen
confided
sweetly
as
she
reached
for
the
deuce
of
spades
the
only
remaining
trump
in
the
dummy
what
your
hurry
child
her
husband
asked
indulgently
lead
this
and
he
pointed
toward
the
six
of
diamonds
i
wish
you
got
a
puncture
hugo
so
you
could
have
butted
in
before
this
hand
was
played
carolyn
drake
spluttered
remember
this
is
a
little
slam
bid
doubled
and
redoubled
i
should
think
would
like
to
forget
that
carolyn
penny
commented
bitingly
but
i
agree
with
carolyn
hugo
that
karen
is
quite
capable
of
making
her
little
slam
without
your
assistance
please
do
mind
karen
begged
hugo
just
wanted
to
help
me
because
i
such
a
dub
at
bridge
the
finest
little
player
in
town
judge
marshall
encouraged
her
gallantly
but
with
a
jaunty
wink
at
the
belligerent
penny
smiling
adoringly
at
him
again
karen
took
his
suggestion
and
led
the
six
of
diamonds
from
the
dummy
penny
covered
it
with
the
nine
karen
ruffed
with
the
seven
of
spades
from
her
own
hand
and
drake
lugubriously
contributed
the
four
of
diamonds
i
can
get
my
trumps
out
now
ca
i
hugo
karen
asked
deprecatingly
and
at
her
husband
smiling
permission
she
led
the
king
of
spades
carolyn
had
to
give
up
the
jack
which
she
must
have
foolishly
thought
would
take
a
trick
the
dummy
contributed
the
deuce
and
penny
followed
with
her
own
last
trump
the
eight
karen
counted
on
her
fingers
her
eyes
on
the
remaining
trumps
in
her
hand
then
smiled
triumphantly
up
at
her
husband
why
not
simply
tell
us
karen
that
the
rest
of
the
trumps
are
in
your
own
hand
penny
suggested
caustically
i
i
did
mean
to
do
anything
wrong
karen
pleaded
as
she
led
now
with
the
ten
of
hearts
which
drew
in
carolyn
queen
to
cover
carolyn
murmuring
religiously
always
cover
an
honor
with
an
honor
or
should
i
have
played
second
hand
low
penny
topped
by
the
king
in
the
dummy
the
trick
being
completed
by
penny
three
of
hearts
at
that
point
john
drake
marched
into
the
room
strode
straight
to
dundee
and
spoke
with
cold
anger
enough
of
this
nonsense
i
for
one
refuse
to
act
like
a
puppet
for
your
amusement
if
you
are
so
vitally
interested
in
contract
bridge
i
should
advise
you
to
take
lessons
from
an
expert
not
from
three
terrified
women
who
are
rather
poor
players
at
best
i
also
advise
you
to
get
about
the
business
you
are
supposed
to
be
here
for
the
finding
of
a
murderer
chapter
six
before
drake
had
reached
his
side
his
purpose
plain
upon
his
stern
rather
ascetic
features
dundee
had
taken
a
hasty
glance
at
the
watch
cupped
in
his
palm
and
noted
the
exact
minute
and
second
of
the
interruption
time
out
one
moment
drake
he
said
calmly
i
quite
agree
with
you
from
your
viewpoint
what
mine
is
you
ca
be
expected
to
know
but
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
consider
it
of
vital
importance
to
the
investigation
of
the
murder
of
selim
that
this
particular
bridge
hand
with
all
its
attending
remarks
the
usual
bickering
and
its
interruptions
of
arriving
guests
for
cocktails
be
played
out
exactly
as
it
was
this
afternoon
i
thought
i
had
made
myself
clear
before
if
you
do
wish
me
to
believe
that
have
something
to
by
refusing
to
take
part
in
a
rather
grisly
game
certainly
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
john
drake
snorted
angrily
then
please
bow
as
gracefully
as
possible
to
necessity
dundee
urged
without
rancor
and
may
i
ask
before
we
go
on
if
you
made
your
entrance
at
this
time
and
the
facts
of
your
arrival
drake
considered
a
moment
gnawing
a
thin
upper
lip
beads
of
sweat
stood
on
his
high
narrow
forehead
i
walked
over
from
the
country
club
after
eighteen
holes
of
golf
with
your
the
district
attorney
drake
answered
with
nasty
emphasis
i
left
the
clubhouse
at
calculating
that
it
would
take
me
about
twenty
minutes
for
the
walk
of
of
about
a
mile
dundee
made
a
mental
note
to
find
out
exactly
how
far
from
this
lonely
house
in
primrose
meadows
the
country
club
actually
was
but
his
next
question
was
along
another
line
you
mr
drake
after
eighteen
holes
of
golf
on
a
warm
day
drake
flushed
my
wife
had
the
car
i
had
driven
out
with
sanderson
but
he
was
called
away
by
a
long
distance
message
i
lingered
at
the
club
for
a
while
chatting
and
er
having
a
cool
drink
or
two
then
i
set
out
afoot
no
one
offered
you
a
lift
dundee
inquired
suavely
no
i
presume
my
thought
i
had
my
car
with
me
and
i
asked
no
one
for
a
lift
for
i
rather
fancied
the
idea
of
a
walk
across
the
meadows
i
see
said
dundee
thoughtfully
now
as
to
your
arrival
here
i
walked
in
the
door
had
been
left
on
the
latch
as
it
usually
is
when
a
party
is
on
drake
explained
coldly
and
i
was
just
entering
the
room
when
i
heard
my
wife
make
the
remark
about
covering
an
honor
with
an
honor
and
then
her
question
of
penny
as
to
whether
she
should
have
played
second
hand
low
so
you
entered
this
time
at
the
correct
moment
said
dundee
now
drake
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
the
room
and
do
exactly
as
you
did
upon
your
arrival
at
approximately
i
am
sure
you
would
not
willingly
hamper
me
or
in
this
investigation
drake
wheeled
ungraciously
and
returned
to
the
doorway
while
dundee
again
consulted
his
watch
mentally
subtracting
the
minutes
which
had
been
wasted
upon
this
interruption
from
the
time
he
had
marked
upon
his
memory
as
the
moment
at
which
drake
had
interfered
but
an
undercurrent
of
skepticism
nagged
at
his
mind
why
had
drake
chosen
to
and
why
had
it
taken
him
from
to
approximately
to
walk
a
mile
or
less
the
average
walker
and
especially
one
accustomed
to
playing
golf
could
easily
have
covered
a
mile
in
fifteen
minutes
instead
of
the
minutes
drake
had
admitted
to
if
it
a
mile
was
it
possible
that
the
banker
loved
wildflowers
with
head
up
aggressively
drake
was
undoubtedly
making
an
effort
to
throw
himself
into
the
role
or
perhaps
into
a
role
chosen
on
the
spot
where
everybody
he
called
from
the
doorway
am
i
early
do
interrupt
please
dear
carolyn
drake
answered
her
voice
trembling
now
where
before
it
must
have
been
sharp
and
querulous
silently
drake
took
his
place
behind
his
wife
chair
laying
a
hand
affectionately
upon
her
shoulder
dundee
watching
closely
saw
eyes
widen
with
something
like
shocked
surprise
so
drake
trying
to
deceive
him
counting
on
the
oneness
of
this
group
his
closest
friends
karen
obviously
flustered
too
reached
to
the
dummy
for
the
ace
of
diamonds
to
which
penny
played
the
three
karen
herself
discarding
the
ten
of
clubs
and
drake
the
five
of
diamonds
you
asked
no
questions
mr
drake
dundee
interpolated
the
banker
flushed
again
i
yes
i
believe
i
did
carolyn
drake
explained
that
karen
was
playing
for
a
little
slam
in
spades
and
that
she
had
doubled
principle
he
added
acidly
a
voice
which
drake
must
be
very
well
accustomed
to
dundee
surmised
and
when
i
told
you
that
nita
had
redoubled
and
it
looked
as
if
she
was
going
to
make
it
carolyn
drake
whimpered
and
shifted
her
short
stout
body
in
the
little
bridge
chair
you
said
why
not
tell
the
truth
you
said
it
was
just
like
me
and
i
might
as
well
take
to
tatting
at
bridge
parties
that
was
said
jokingly
my
dear
drake
retorted
with
a
coldness
that
tried
to
be
affectionate
warmth
play
bridge
dundee
commanded
sure
that
the
approximate
length
of
the
previous
dispute
had
now
been
taken
up
whatever
retort
carolyn
drake
had
made
then
he
checked
himself
again
looking
at
his
watch
and
just
what
did
you
answer
to
your
husband
little
joke
mrs
drake
i
i
the
woman
looked
helplessly
around
the
table
her
eyes
reddened
with
tears
then
she
plunged
recklessly
after
a
fearful
glance
at
dundee
implacable
face
i
said
that
if
it
was
nita
he
was
talking
to
he
would
speak
in
that
tone
that
she
could
make
all
the
foolish
mistakes
of
or
revoking
or
doubling
that
she
wanted
to
and
he
would
say
a
word
except
to
praise
her
then
i
may
as
well
confess
drake
said
acidly
that
i
answered
substantially
as
follows
is
an
bridge
player
as
well
as
a
charming
woman
my
dear
now
make
the
most
of
that
little
family
tiff
sir
and
be
damned
to
you
did
that
end
the
scene
mrs
drake
dundee
asked
gently
i
i
said
something
about
all
the
men
thinking
nita
was
perfect
drake
confessed
and
i
cried
a
little
but
we
went
on
with
the
hand
and
johnny
drake
went
away
walking
up
and
down
the
room
waiting
for
nita
to
come
back
i
suppose
then
go
on
with
the
game
dundee
ordered
silently
now
as
silently
as
the
real
game
must
have
been
played
because
of
the
embarrassing
scene
between
husband
and
wife
the
sinister
game
was
carried
to
its
conclusion
karen
led
the
jack
of
hearts
from
the
dummy
penny
played
her
seven
karen
contributed
her
own
deuce
and
drake
followed
suit
with
the
five
again
karen
led
from
the
dummy
with
the
four
of
hearts
followed
by
penny
nine
taking
it
with
her
own
ace
drake
throwing
off
the
five
of
clubs
karen
then
led
the
six
of
hearts
carolyn
drake
discarded
the
six
of
clubs
dummy
took
the
trick
with
the
eight
of
hearts
and
penny
sloughed
the
three
of
clubs
with
a
faint
imitation
of
the
triumph
with
which
she
had
played
the
hand
the
first
time
karen
threw
down
her
remaining
three
trumps
i
made
it
a
little
slam
she
tried
to
sound
very
triumphant
doubled
and
redoubled
how
much
did
i
did
nita
and
i
make
penny
plenty
but
before
putting
pencil
to
score
pad
penny
cupped
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
stared
at
carolyn
drake
i
like
to
know
carolyn
if
it
is
one
of
your
most
cherished
secrets
possessed
you
to
double
in
the
first
place
carolyn
drake
flushed
scarlet
as
she
protested
feebly
i
thought
of
course
i
could
take
two
club
tricks
with
my
ace
and
king
that
why
i
doubled
the
little
slam
of
course
and
my
first
double
simply
meant
that
i
had
one
good
suit
i
thought
if
you
could
bid
at
all
that
my
two
doubletons
oh
what
the
use
penny
groaned
but
may
i
remind
you
that
it
is
bridge
to
lead
from
a
queen
you
led
the
deuce
of
diamonds
when
of
course
the
play
since
you
had
seen
the
ace
in
the
dummy
was
to
lead
your
queen
forcing
the
ace
and
leaving
my
king
guarded
to
take
a
trick
later
but
karen
did
have
any
diamonds
at
all
carolyn
defended
herself
a
secret
you
were
in
on
when
you
led
from
your
queen
penny
reminded
her
oh
well
we
pay
up
and
shut
up
and
she
made
a
pretense
of
totting
up
the
score
while
karen
who
had
risen
stood
over
her
like
a
bird
poised
for
flight
at
that
instant
dexter
sprague
began
to
advance
into
the
room
janet
raymond
at
his
side
her
face
flaming
behave
exactly
as
you
did
before
dundee
commanded
in
a
harsh
whisper
no
time
for
coddling
these
people
now
dexter
sprague
face
took
on
a
yellower
tinge
but
he
obeyed
greetings
he
called
in
the
jaunty
tones
of
a
man
who
knows
himself
not
too
welcome
where
nita
and
everybody
is
that
the
cocktail
shaker
i
hear
having
received
no
answer
from
anyone
present
sprague
strolled
through
the
living
room
and
on
into
the
dining
room
janet
following
judge
marshall
had
nodded
stiffly
and
john
drake
had
muttered
the
semblance
of
a
greeting
were
they
all
overdoing
it
a
bit
this
reacting
of
their
hostility
to
the
sole
remaining
outsider
of
their
compact
little
group
dundee
stroked
his
chin
thoughtfully
but
penny
was
saying
in
her
abrupt
husky
voice
above
the
line
below
the
line
making
a
total
of
on
this
hand
karen
wo
nita
be
glad
karen
gasped
then
began
to
run
totteringly
calling
nita
nita
but
in
the
hall
she
collapsed
shuddering
crying
in
a
child
whimper
no
no
i
ca
go
in
there
again
it
was
dundee
who
reached
her
first
dundee
and
not
her
outraged
and
excited
old
husband
marshall
listen
please
he
begged
in
a
low
voice
as
he
lifted
her
so
that
her
head
rested
against
his
arm
you
have
been
splendid
wonderful
please
believe
that
i
am
truly
sorry
to
distress
you
so
and
that
very
soon
i
hope
you
may
go
home
and
rest
i
ca
bear
any
more
karen
whimpered
ignoring
judge
marshall
blustering
dundee
continued
softly
you
do
want
the
wrong
person
to
be
accused
of
this
terrible
crime
do
you
mrs
marshall
of
course
not
and
you
want
to
help
us
all
you
can
to
discover
who
really
killed
mrs
selim
i
i
suppose
so
karen
conceded
on
a
sob
then
i
help
you
i
go
to
the
bedroom
with
you
dundee
promised
her
with
a
sigh
of
relief
to
the
others
he
spoke
sharply
go
back
to
the
exact
positions
in
living
room
and
dining
room
and
solarium
that
you
occupied
when
marshall
ran
from
the
room
i
think
you
overdoing
it
bonnie
captain
strawn
protested
but
sure
i
see
that
they
mind
you
with
karen
marshall
clinging
to
his
arm
dundee
walked
down
the
hall
beyond
the
staircase
to
an
open
door
on
his
left
a
door
guarded
by
a
lounging
plainclothesman
seated
at
the
of
the
lavatory
was
flora
miles
her
sallow
dark
face
so
ravaged
that
she
looked
ten
years
older
than
when
he
had
first
seen
her
an
hour
before
so
you
were
in
here
when
you
heard
marshall
scream
mrs
miles
dundee
paused
to
ask
yes
yes
she
gasped
rising
and
that
horrible
man
has
made
me
stay
in
here
of
course
the
door
was
closed
before
i
telephoned
home
to
ask
about
my
children
and
then
i
came
in
here
to
to
do
my
face
over
you
did
hear
your
husband
arrive
no
i
did
hear
him
arrive
flora
miles
faltered
her
handkerchief
dabbing
at
her
trembling
lips
i
see
dundee
said
slowly
he
stepped
into
the
little
room
leaving
karen
to
stand
weakly
against
the
door
frame
without
a
word
to
mrs
miles
he
looked
closely
at
the
top
of
the
and
into
the
small
wastebasket
that
stood
beside
it
you
you
can
see
that
i
my
face
before
i
put
on
fresh
powder
and
and
rouged
flora
miles
pointed
out
with
an
obvious
effort
at
offended
dignity
after
i
came
back
while
you
were
making
those
poor
girls
play
the
hand
over
again
i
went
through
the
same
motions
because
you
told
all
of
us
to
behave
exactly
as
we
had
done
before
i
see
dundee
agreed
pretty
clever
in
spite
of
being
almost
frightened
to
death
dundee
said
to
himself
but
he
had
been
just
a
shade
cleverer
than
she
for
he
had
been
in
this
room
ahead
of
her
and
there
had
been
no
balls
of
greasy
face
tissue
in
the
wastebasket
then
he
was
passing
out
of
the
room
offering
his
arm
to
karen
when
one
of
his
underlined
notes
thrust
itself
upon
his
memory
may
i
see
your
bridge
tally
please
mrs
miles
my
bridge
tally
she
echoed
blankly
why
it
must
be
on
the
table
where
i
was
playing
it
is
not
dundee
assured
her
quietly
perhaps
it
is
in
your
handbag
and
he
glanced
at
the
rather
large
raffia
bag
that
lay
on
the
table
she
snatched
it
up
slightly
averting
her
body
as
she
looked
hastily
through
its
contents
it
is
here
oh
i
do
know
it
is
what
does
it
matter
without
replying
dundee
escorted
the
trembling
little
discoverer
of
nita
selim
body
into
the
large
ornate
bedroom
murmuring
as
he
did
so
do
be
frightened
marshall
the
bod
i
mean
selim
here
now
and
you
sha
have
to
scream
i
give
the
signal
myself
i
just
want
you
to
go
through
the
same
motions
you
did
before
on
jerky
feet
the
girl
advanced
to
nita
now
deserted
vanity
dresser
i
i
was
calling
to
her
all
the
time
she
whispered
i
did
even
wait
to
knock
and
i
i
began
to
tell
her
how
much
we
made
off
that
hand
when
i
when
she
did
answer
i
did
touch
her
but
i
saw
i
saw
again
she
gripped
her
face
with
her
hands
and
was
about
to
scream
i
know
dundee
assured
her
gently
then
he
shouted
ready
herded
by
strawn
the
small
crowd
of
men
and
women
came
running
into
the
room
judge
marshall
leading
the
way
penny
being
second
in
line
penny
why
not
flora
miles
who
had
been
nearer
to
that
room
than
any
of
the
others
if
her
story
was
true
dundee
asked
himself
but
all
had
crowded
into
the
room
including
polly
beale
and
clive
hammond
before
mrs
miles
crept
in
is
this
the
order
of
your
arrival
dundee
asked
them
all
penny
who
was
standing
against
the
wall
just
inside
the
doorway
spoke
up
staring
at
flora
with
frowning
intentness
you
sort
of
mixed
up
are
you
flora
i
was
standing
right
here
until
the
worst
of
it
was
over
i
did
even
go
near
nita
and
i
know
you
did
pass
me
i
remember
that
tracey
stepped
away
from
the
body
and
called
you
and
you
were
here
and
then
almost
the
next
minute
i
saw
you
coming
toward
him
from
from
and
penny
pointed
toward
that
corner
of
the
room
which
held
on
one
angle
the
door
leading
to
the
porch
and
on
its
other
angle
the
window
from
which
or
from
near
which
nita
selim
had
been
shot
you
lying
penny
crain
i
did
no
such
thing
flora
miles
cried
hysterically
i
came
running
in
with
with
the
rest
of
you
and
i
rushed
over
there
just
to
see
if
i
could
see
anybody
running
away
across
the
meadow
my
wife
is
right
sir
tracey
miles
added
his
word
aggressively
i
saw
what
she
was
doing
the
most
sensible
of
all
of
us
and
i
ran
to
join
her
we
looked
out
of
the
windows
both
the
side
windows
and
the
rear
ones
and
out
onto
the
porch
but
we
did
see
anything
surprisingly
dundee
abandoned
the
point
and
you
were
the
only
one
to
touch
her
sprague
i
believe
so
dexter
sprague
answered
in
a
strained
voice
i
laid
my
hand
on
her
her
hair
for
an
instant
then
i
picked
up
her
hand
to
see
if
if
there
was
any
pulse
left
yes
she
she
was
dead
and
her
hand
did
it
feel
cold
neither
cold
nor
warm
just
cool
sprague
answered
in
a
voice
that
was
nearly
strangled
with
emotion
she
she
always
had
cool
hands
what
did
you
do
judge
marshall
dundee
asked
abruptly
i
took
my
poor
little
wife
away
from
this
room
laid
her
on
a
couch
in
the
living
room
and
then
telephoned
the
police
miss
crain
stood
at
my
elbow
urging
me
to
hurry
so
that
she
might
ring
you
as
she
did
your
line
was
busy
and
she
lost
about
five
minutes
before
getting
you
and
the
rest
of
you
dundee
asked
nothing
spectacular
i
afraid
dundee
polly
beale
answered
in
her
brusque
deep
voice
now
edged
with
scorn
further
questioning
elicited
little
more
beyond
the
fact
that
clive
hammond
had
dashed
out
to
circle
the
house
and
look
over
the
grounds
and
that
john
drake
had
been
fully
occupied
with
an
hysterical
wife
better
let
this
bunch
go
for
the
present
had
we
boy
captain
strawn
whispered
uneasily
not
a
thing
on
any
of
them
not
quite
yet
sir
if
you
do
mind
dundee
answered
in
a
low
voice
will
you
take
them
back
into
the
living
room
and
put
them
under
sergeant
turner
charge
for
a
while
then
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
like
to
talk
over
with
you
mollified
by
the
younger
man
deference
and
persuasiveness
strawn
obeyed
the
suggestion
to
return
within
five
minutes
his
grey
brows
drawn
into
a
frown
i
hope
you
be
willing
to
take
full
credit
for
that
fool
bridge
game
bonnie
he
worried
do
want
to
look
a
chump
in
the
newspapers
i
take
the
blame
dundee
assured
him
with
a
grin
but
that
bridge
game
and
i
admit
it
was
a
horrible
thing
to
have
to
do
told
me
a
whole
bunch
of
facts
that
ought
to
be
very
very
useful
for
instance
strawn
growled
for
instance
dundee
answered
it
told
me
that
it
took
approximately
eight
minutes
to
play
out
a
little
slam
bid
when
ordinarily
it
would
have
taken
not
more
than
two
or
three
minutes
not
only
that
but
it
told
me
the
names
of
everyone
in
party
who
could
have
killed
nita
selim
and
good
lord
of
course
and
to
captain
strawn
amazement
dundee
threw
open
the
door
of
big
clothes
closet
jerked
on
the
light
and
stooped
to
the
floor
chapter
seven
almost
immediately
special
investigator
dundee
rose
from
his
crouching
position
on
the
floor
of
nita
selim
closet
and
faced
the
chief
of
the
homicide
squad
of
hamilton
police
force
i
think
he
said
quietly
for
all
the
excitement
that
burned
in
his
blue
eyes
that
we
better
have
mrs
miles
in
for
a
few
questions
what
have
you
got
there
a
dance
program
strawn
asked
curiously
but
as
dundee
continued
to
stare
silently
at
the
thing
he
held
the
older
man
strode
to
the
door
and
relayed
the
order
to
a
plainclothes
detective
i
sent
for
miles
dundee
said
coldly
when
husband
and
wife
appeared
together
flora
thin
tense
shoulders
encircled
by
plump
arm
if
you
going
to
badger
my
wife
further
i
intend
to
be
present
sir
miles
retorted
thrusting
out
his
chest
very
well
dundee
conceded
curtly
mrs
miles
why
did
you
tell
me
in
the
first
place
that
you
were
this
when
nita
selim
was
shot
because
i
was
in
in
the
room
flora
protested
clinging
with
both
thin
hands
to
her
husband
arm
sir
you
have
no
proof
of
this
absurd
accusation
and
i
shall
personally
take
this
matter
up
i
have
the
best
of
proof
dundee
said
quietly
and
took
his
hand
from
his
pocket
you
recognize
this
mrs
miles
you
admit
that
it
is
the
tally
card
you
used
while
playing
bridge
this
afternoon
no
no
it
is
mine
flora
cried
hysterically
cringing
against
her
husband
who
began
to
protest
in
a
voice
falsetto
with
rage
dundee
ignored
his
splutterings
may
i
point
out
that
it
is
identical
with
the
other
tally
cards
used
at
selim
party
today
and
that
on
its
face
it
bears
your
name
and
he
politely
extended
the
card
for
her
inspection
i
yes
it
be
mine
but
i
was
in
this
room
when
nita
was
was
shot
but
you
will
admit
that
you
in
her
clothes
closet
at
some
time
during
the
twenty
or
more
minutes
that
elapsed
between
your
leaving
the
bridge
game
when
you
became
dummy
and
the
moment
when
karen
marshall
screamed
as
flora
miles
said
nothing
staring
at
him
with
great
terrified
black
eyes
dundee
went
on
relentlessly
mrs
miles
when
you
left
the
bridge
game
you
did
not
intend
to
telephone
your
house
you
came
into
this
room
and
you
lay
in
wait
hiding
in
her
closet
until
nita
selim
appeared
as
you
knew
she
would
sooner
or
later
no
no
that
a
lie
a
lie
i
tell
you
the
woman
shrilled
at
him
i
telephone
my
house
and
i
talked
to
junior
when
the
maid
put
him
up
to
the
phone
you
can
ask
her
yourself
if
you
do
believe
me
but
you
telephoned
you
stole
into
this
room
no
no
i
i
made
up
my
face
all
fresh
just
as
i
told
you
dundee
did
not
bother
to
tell
her
how
well
he
knew
she
was
lying
for
suddenly
something
knocked
on
the
door
of
his
mind
he
strode
to
the
closet
searched
for
a
moment
among
the
multitude
of
garments
hanging
there
then
emerged
with
the
brown
silk
summer
coat
which
nita
selim
had
worn
to
breakaway
inn
that
noon
before
the
terrified
woman
eyes
he
thrust
a
hand
first
into
one
deep
pocket
and
then
another
finding
nothing
except
a
handkerchief
of
fine
embroidered
linen
and
a
pair
of
brown
suede
gauntlet
gloves
will
you
let
me
have
the
note
please
mrs
miles
the
note
nita
received
during
her
luncheon
party
and
which
she
thrust
before
your
eyes
into
a
pocket
of
this
coat
it
is
in
your
handbag
i
am
sure
since
you
have
had
no
opportunity
unobserved
to
destroy
it
what
ghastly
nonsense
is
this
dundee
tracey
miles
demanded
furiously
but
dundee
again
ignored
him
his
implacable
eyes
held
flora
until
the
woman
broke
suddenly
piteously
she
fumbled
in
the
raffia
bag
which
had
been
hanging
from
her
arm
good
god
flora
what
does
it
all
mean
tracey
miles
collapsed
like
a
pricked
pink
balloon
that
stationery
one
of
my
business
envelopes
flora
miles
dropped
the
bag
which
she
need
no
longer
watch
and
clutch
with
terror
as
she
dug
her
thin
fingers
into
her
husband
shoulders
and
looked
down
at
his
puzzled
face
for
she
was
a
little
taller
than
he
forgive
me
darling
oh
i
knew
god
would
punish
me
for
being
jealous
i
thought
were
writing
love
letters
to
to
that
woman
dundee
did
not
miss
the
slightest
significance
of
that
scene
as
he
retrieved
the
envelope
she
had
dropped
it
was
inscribed
in
a
curious
handwriting
selim
private
dining
room
breakaway
inn
let
see
boy
strawn
said
with
respect
in
his
harsh
voice
dundee
withdrew
the
single
sheet
of
business
stationery
and
obligingly
held
it
so
that
the
chief
of
detectives
could
read
it
also
nita
my
sweet
the
note
began
without
forgive
your
bad
boy
for
last
night
row
but
i
warn
you
again
to
watch
your
step
you
already
gone
too
far
of
course
i
love
you
and
understand
be
good
baby
and
you
wo
be
sorry
the
note
was
signed
dexy
dundee
tapped
the
note
for
a
long
minute
while
tracey
miles
continued
to
console
his
wife
a
new
avenue
he
thought
perhaps
a
long
long
avenue
mrs
miles
he
began
abruptly
and
the
face
turned
toward
him
you
say
you
thought
this
letter
to
selim
had
been
written
by
your
husband
yes
she
gasped
i
i
admit
it
and
when
i
saw
one
of
our
own
i
mean
one
of
tracey
business
envelopes
you
made
up
your
mind
to
steal
it
and
read
it
yes
i
did
a
wife
has
a
right
to
know
what
her
husband
doing
if
it
anything
like
that
her
haggard
black
eyes
again
implored
her
husband
for
forgiveness
before
she
went
on
i
slip
into
room
and
go
into
her
closet
to
see
if
she
had
left
the
letter
in
her
coat
pocket
i
closed
the
door
on
myself
thinking
i
could
find
the
light
cord
but
it
was
caught
in
one
of
the
dresses
or
something
and
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
find
it
in
the
dark
of
the
closet
but
i
did
find
it
at
last
and
was
just
reading
the
note
you
it
even
after
you
saw
that
the
handwriting
on
the
envelope
was
your
husband
dundee
queried
in
assumed
amazement
flora
thin
body
sagged
i
i
thought
maybe
tracey
had
disguised
his
handwriting
so
i
read
it
and
saw
it
was
from
dexter
mr
miles
do
you
know
how
some
of
your
business
stationery
got
into
sprague
hands
he
had
plenty
of
opportunity
to
filch
stationery
or
almost
anything
he
wants
hanging
around
my
offices
as
he
does
an
idler
but
dundee
was
in
a
hurry
he
wheeled
from
the
garrulity
of
the
husband
to
the
tense
terror
of
the
wife
mrs
miles
i
want
you
to
tell
me
exactly
what
you
know
unless
you
prefer
to
consult
a
lawyer
first
sir
if
you
are
insinuating
that
oh
let
me
tell
him
tracey
mrs
miles
capitulated
suddenly
completely
i
in
the
closet
when
nita
was
killed
i
suppose
but
i
did
she
was
being
killed
i
was
lying
in
there
on
the
closet
floor
in
a
dead
faint
dundee
stared
at
the
woman
incredulously
then
suppressed
a
groan
of
almost
unbearable
disappointment
if
flora
miles
was
telling
the
truth
here
went
his
only
probably
or
rather
his
only
just
when
did
you
faint
mrs
miles
he
asked
struggling
for
patience
before
or
after
nita
came
into
this
room
i
was
just
finishing
the
note
with
the
light
on
in
the
closet
and
the
door
shut
when
i
heard
nita
come
into
the
room
i
knew
it
was
nita
because
she
was
singing
one
of
those
broadway
songs
she
is
was
so
crazy
about
i
jerked
off
the
light
and
crouched
way
back
in
a
corner
of
the
closet
a
velvet
evening
wrap
fell
down
over
my
head
and
i
was
nearly
smothering
but
i
was
afraid
to
try
to
dislodge
it
for
fear
a
hanger
would
fall
to
the
floor
and
make
an
awful
clatter
and
then
and
then
she
shuddered
and
clung
to
her
husband
what
caused
you
to
faint
mrs
miles
sir
my
wife
has
heart
trouble
what
did
you
hear
mrs
miles
dundee
persisted
i
could
hear
very
well
all
tangled
up
in
the
coat
and
back
in
the
closet
but
i
did
hear
a
kind
of
bang
or
bump
no
no
not
a
pistol
shot
and
because
it
came
from
so
near
me
i
thought
it
was
nita
or
lydia
coming
to
get
something
out
of
the
closet
and
i
be
discovered
so
i
i
fainted
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
went
on
when
i
came
to
i
heard
karen
scream
and
then
people
running
in
but
all
the
time
that
awful
tune
was
going
on
and
on
tune
dundee
gasped
do
you
mean
nita
selim
flora
miles
seemed
to
be
dazed
by
dundee
vehement
question
why
yes
nita
own
tune
that
what
she
called
it
her
own
tune
but
mrs
miles
dundee
protested
ashamed
that
his
scalp
was
prickling
with
horror
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
nita
was
not
dead
when
karen
marshall
screamed
dead
flora
repeated
more
bewildered
of
course
she
was
or
at
least
they
all
said
so
oh
i
know
what
you
mean
and
you
do
mean
what
i
mean
at
all
steady
tracey
miles
urged
putting
his
arm
about
his
wife
i
better
tell
you
dundee
when
we
all
came
running
into
the
room
there
was
nita
powder
box
playing
its
tune
over
and
over
oh
dundee
wiped
his
forehead
you
mean
it
a
musical
box
yes
and
plays
when
the
lid
is
off
tracey
answered
obviously
delighted
to
have
the
limelight
again
well
of
course
since
nita
could
put
the
lid
back
on
it
was
still
playing
what
was
the
tune
honey
he
asked
his
wife
tenderly
i
have
much
ear
for
music
at
best
but
at
a
time
like
that
it
was
playing
flora
answered
wearily
over
and
over
be
my
own
fair
she
quavered
obligingly
only
not
the
words
of
course
just
the
tune
that
why
nita
bought
the
box
i
suppose
because
it
played
her
namesake
song
maybe
one
of
her
beaus
gave
it
to
her
tracey
suggested
lightly
patting
his
wife
trembling
shoulder
anyway
dundee
the
thing
ran
on
and
on
until
it
ran
down
i
suppose
i
confess
i
wanted
to
put
the
lid
back
on
to
stop
the
damned
thing
but
hugo
said
we
must
touch
anything
and
quite
right
dundee
cut
in
now
mrs
miles
about
that
noise
you
heard
did
you
hear
anyone
enter
the
room
no
well
then
did
you
hear
nita
speak
to
anyone
you
said
you
thought
it
might
be
lydia
coming
to
get
something
out
of
the
closet
i
did
hear
nita
speak
a
word
to
anybody
though
she
might
have
and
i
would
have
heard
all
muffled
up
in
that
velvet
evening
wrap
and
so
far
back
in
the
closet
did
you
hear
the
door
onto
the
porch
it
near
the
closet
the
door
was
open
when
we
came
in
dundee
tracey
interposed
it
must
have
been
open
all
the
time
i
did
hear
it
open
mrs
miles
confirmed
him
wearily
i
tell
you
i
did
hear
except
nita
coming
in
singing
then
the
powder
box
playing
its
tune
and
that
bang
or
bump
i
told
you
about
and
just
where
was
that
dundee
persisted
do
know
she
shrilled
hysteria
rising
in
her
voice
again
i
told
you
it
sounded
fairly
near
the
closet
as
if
as
if
somebody
bumped
into
something
that
what
it
was
like
that
exactly
what
it
was
like
and
i
was
so
frightened
of
being
found
in
the
closet
that
i
fainted
and
did
come
to
until
karen
screamed
she
was
babbling
on
but
dundee
was
thinking
hard
a
very
convenient
faint
that
for
the
murderer
at
least
but
why
not
for
mrs
miles
herself
odd
that
she
should
why
had
she
trumped
up
some
excuse
immediately
and
left
the
closet
as
nita
was
entering
the
room
was
it
possibly
because
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
great
relief
of
finding
that
it
was
sprague
not
her
husband
who
had
been
writing
love
letters
to
nita
selim
a
jealous
woman
miles
he
began
abruptly
i
think
you
better
tell
me
how
your
wife
became
so
jealous
of
you
and
nita
selim
that
she
could
get
herself
into
such
a
false
position
tracey
miles
reddened
but
a
gesture
of
one
of
his
sunburned
hands
restrained
his
wife
passionate
defense
of
him
it
the
truth
that
flora
is
and
i
suppose
he
faltered
a
moment
and
his
eyes
did
not
meet
his
wife
that
i
liked
seeing
her
a
little
bit
jealous
of
her
old
man
sort
of
makes
a
man
feel
well
big
you
know
and
pretty
important
to
somebody
so
you
were
just
having
a
bit
of
fun
with
your
wife
so
far
as
selim
was
concerned
dundee
asked
coldly
the
blood
flowed
through
the
thinning
blond
hair
not
exactly
he
admitted
frankly
you
see
i
take
a
shine
to
nita
and
if
i
do
say
so
myself
she
liked
me
a
lot
oh
nothing
serious
just
a
little
flirtation
like
most
of
our
crowd
have
with
each
other
mrs
miles
dundee
interrupted
with
sudden
harshness
are
you
you
did
not
know
that
that
letter
was
from
dexter
sprague
before
you
looked
for
it
sir
if
you
are
insinuating
that
carried
on
a
flirtation
or
an
an
with
that
sprague
insect
tracey
began
to
bluster
but
dundee
eyes
were
on
flora
miles
and
he
saw
that
her
sallow
skin
had
tightened
like
greyish
silk
over
her
thin
cheek
bones
and
that
her
eyes
looked
suddenly
dead
and
glassy
you
you
say
mrs
miles
dundee
went
on
inexorably
was
it
because
by
any
chance
this
note
and
he
tapped
the
sheet
which
had
caused
so
much
trouble
revealed
the
fact
that
nita
selim
and
dexter
sprague
were
sweethearts
or
lovers
it
was
a
battle
between
those
two
now
both
ignored
tracey
rage
flora
licked
her
dry
lips
no
no
she
whispered
it
was
because
i
was
jealous
of
tracey
and
nita
yes
and
i
given
her
cause
to
be
jealous
too
tracey
forced
himself
into
the
conversation
one
night
at
the
country
club
flora
saw
me
and
nita
stroll
off
the
porch
and
down
onto
the
grounds
and
she
had
a
right
to
be
sore
at
me
when
i
got
back
because
i
cut
a
dance
with
her
my
own
wife
and
it
was
only
this
very
morning
that
i
made
a
point
of
driving
out
of
my
way
too
by
this
house
to
see
nita
not
that
i
meant
any
harm
but
i
was
being
a
little
silly
about
her
and
she
was
about
me
too
not
that
i
leave
my
wife
and
babies
for
any
broadway
beauty
under
the
sun
oh
tracey
and
you
were
going
to
tell
me
was
there
jealousy
now
or
just
pretense
on
flora
part
you
understand
do
you
dundee
tracey
demanded
man
to
man
i
was
just
having
a
little
fun
on
the
side
nothing
serious
mind
you
but
of
course
i
did
tell
flora
every
little
thing
no
man
does
been
other
girls
other
women
tracey
is
worse
than
the
other
men
flora
flamed
up
he
such
a
darling
that
all
the
girls
pet
him
and
spoil
him
dundee
could
stand
no
more
of
miles
complacent
acceptance
of
his
own
rakishness
and
certainly
a
girl
like
nita
selim
would
have
been
able
to
bear
precious
little
of
it
conceited
ass
but
flora
miles
was
another
matter
and
so
was
dexter
sprague
you
can
join
me
in
the
living
room
if
you
like
dundee
said
shortly
as
he
wheeled
and
strode
toward
the
door
was
that
quick
passionate
kiss
between
husband
and
wife
being
staged
for
his
benefit
pretty
near
through
boy
strawn
who
had
been
silent
and
bewildered
for
a
long
time
asked
anxiously
as
the
two
detectives
passed
into
the
hall
not
quite
i
got
to
know
several
things
yet
dundee
answered
absently
but
in
the
living
room
his
mind
was
wholly
upon
the
business
in
hand
i
keep
you
all
no
longer
than
is
absolutely
necessary
he
began
and
again
the
group
in
which
only
dexter
sprague
was
an
alien
grew
taut
with
suspense
from
the
playing
out
of
the
hand
at
bridge
he
went
on
using
the
objectionable
phrase
again
very
deliberately
i
found
that
no
two
of
you
men
arrived
together
hammond
you
were
the
first
to
arrive
i
believe
it
seems
that
i
was
clive
hammond
answered
curtly
and
yet
you
did
not
enter
the
living
room
to
greet
your
hostess
i
wanted
a
private
word
with
polly
miss
beale
my
fiancée
hammond
explained
briefly
how
and
when
did
you
arrive
i
do
know
the
exact
time
never
thought
of
looking
at
my
watch
hammond
offered
i
came
out
in
my
own
roadster
that
tan
stutz
you
may
have
noticed
in
the
driveway
as
for
how
i
entered
the
house
i
leaped
upon
the
porch
and
opened
a
door
of
the
solarium
i
walked
across
the
solarium
saw
polly
just
finishing
with
bridge
for
the
afternoon
and
beckoned
to
her
she
joined
me
in
the
solarium
and
we
stayed
there
until
karen
screamed
that
all
have
you
been
engaged
long
hammond
you
and
miss
beale
dundee
asked
as
if
quite
casually
nearly
a
year
if
it
any
of
your
business
dundee
and
just
when
had
you
seen
miss
beale
last
before
late
this
afternoon
dundee
asked
i
refuse
to
answer
hammond
flared
that
at
least
is
none
of
your
damned
business
i
believe
i
can
answer
my
own
question
hammond
dundee
said
very
softly
chapter
eight
then
why
ask
me
hammond
shrugged
but
his
eyes
flickered
toward
polly
beale
i
thought
perhaps
you
could
give
me
a
little
additional
information
dundee
soothed
him
you
see
it
happens
that
i
saw
you
miss
beale
and
another
young
man
come
into
the
stuart
house
dining
room
about
half
past
one
today
just
when
i
was
thinking
of
lunch
for
myself
the
mysterious
young
man
was
clive
brother
ralph
hammond
polly
beale
cut
in
brusquely
your
decision
to
lunch
with
your
fiancé
and
his
brother
was
quite
a
sudden
one
dundee
asked
courteously
just
when
did
you
change
your
mind
about
selim
luncheon
party
at
breakaway
inn
miss
beale
the
tall
girl
threw
up
her
mannishly
cropped
chestnut
head
there
is
nothing
at
all
sinister
or
even
queer
about
it
dundee
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
luncheon
when
i
decided
to
drive
past
nita
house
on
the
chance
that
she
might
like
me
to
drive
her
over
then
you
did
know
that
dunlap
had
already
arranged
to
meet
selim
downtown
this
morning
and
to
take
her
to
the
inn
dundee
asked
no
i
did
hear
of
the
arrangement
polly
answered
decidedly
you
were
a
close
friend
of
selim
perhaps
dundee
prodded
not
at
all
but
that
would
not
keep
me
from
doing
my
hostess
a
courtesy
she
hated
her
ford
and
liked
expensive
cars
polly
added
unemotionally
it
was
about
a
quarter
to
one
when
i
got
here
i
should
say
nita
was
here
nor
was
her
maid
but
i
saw
ralph
car
parked
in
front
of
the
house
hammond
car
a
woman
squealed
but
dundee
let
polly
continue
i
rang
and
he
answered
the
door
said
he
was
alone
in
the
house
going
over
the
premises
at
judge
marshall
request
polly
said
evenly
that
right
that
right
judge
marshall
agreed
hastily
nita
selim
wanted
the
unfinished
half
of
the
gabled
top
story
finished
up
wanted
a
maid
room
and
bath
and
a
guest
room
and
bath
added
to
the
living
quarters
already
completed
i
gave
the
commission
for
an
estimate
at
least
to
the
hammond
firm
since
they
had
built
the
house
originally
for
crain
penny
father
i
see
dundee
agreed
and
you
sent
your
brother
mr
hammond
he
was
the
natural
one
to
send
clive
hammond
retorted
small
job
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
get
together
an
estimate
on
additional
furnace
lines
and
radiators
electric
wiring
plumbing
plastering
etc
go
on
miss
beale
dundee
directed
thanks
there
was
sarcasm
in
her
brusque
voice
but
that
really
about
all
i
have
to
tell
ralph
complained
that
he
was
hungry
and
charged
me
with
giving
him
too
little
of
my
time
the
usual
thing
i
picked
up
nita
phone
called
clive
and
made
the
date
for
the
three
of
us
then
i
called
breakaway
inn
cancelled
the
luncheon
part
of
the
bridge
party
with
nita
and
ralph
and
i
drove
back
to
hamilton
dundee
studied
her
strong
clever
almost
plain
face
for
a
long
minute
certainly
polly
beale
did
not
look
like
a
liar
but
he
would
have
taken
his
oath
that
she
was
lying
now
or
rather
not
revealing
the
whole
truth
behind
the
actual
facts
of
her
movements
that
day
for
instance
could
a
simple
plea
of
her
future
make
her
do
so
discourteous
a
thing
as
to
break
a
luncheon
appointment
especially
when
such
a
course
would
not
only
disappoint
her
hostess
and
her
friends
but
disarrange
the
seating
plan
of
a
rather
formal
party
of
course
the
explanation
was
obvious
she
had
wanted
first
to
see
nita
and
remonstrate
privately
with
her
for
having
so
enslaved
ralph
hammond
when
he
was
tacitly
known
to
belong
to
penny
crain
one
of
the
sacred
crowd
failing
that
she
had
found
ralph
himself
and
had
not
expected
to
find
him
had
talked
with
him
about
nita
and
had
quarreled
a
bit
with
him
perhaps
over
his
behavior
and
the
crisis
had
become
so
acute
that
polly
had
arbitrarily
called
upon
clive
hammond
and
then
had
forced
ralph
to
accompany
her
do
you
know
miss
beale
why
ralph
hammond
did
not
keep
engagement
with
selim
this
afternoon
or
rather
his
promise
to
appear
for
cocktails
and
to
be
miss
crain
partner
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
dinner
and
dancing
at
the
country
club
i
do
not
polly
said
crisply
hammond
neither
do
i
hammond
retorted
angrily
then
it
was
not
to
discuss
ralph
hammond
and
his
affairs
that
you
beckoned
miss
beale
to
meet
you
in
the
solarium
upon
your
arrival
it
a
shade
too
much
anger
and
emphasis
dundee
decided
and
he
wished
heartily
that
strawn
detectives
would
not
delay
much
longer
in
bringing
the
missing
young
man
into
this
already
involved
examination
you
say
that
you
both
were
in
the
solarium
from
the
time
of
your
arrival
hammond
until
marshall
screamed
dundee
continued
just
what
did
you
see
and
hear
dundee
watched
their
faces
keenly
but
again
they
were
expressionless
it
was
polly
beale
who
answered
naturally
there
was
not
absolute
silence
but
i
am
afraid
we
were
not
listening
we
were
rather
engrossed
in
our
conversation
we
were
seated
near
no
windows
and
i
for
one
nothing
as
well
as
heard
nothing
that
i
can
recall
hammond
that
goes
for
me
too
absolutely
abruptly
abandoning
the
engaged
couple
dundee
returned
to
miles
you
were
the
second
arrival
then
yes
i
parked
my
car
along
the
curb
in
front
of
the
house
tracey
answered
readily
and
i
came
right
on
in
and
nita
jumped
up
yes
we
had
all
that
twice
before
dundee
interrupted
cruelly
now
judge
marshall
one
of
my
friends
gave
me
a
lift
from
town
judge
marshall
volunteered
pompously
chap
named
sampson
you
may
have
heard
of
him
fine
fellow
splendid
lawyer
we
played
billiards
together
at
the
athletic
club
and
when
i
was
about
to
call
a
taxi
my
wife
having
the
car
here
he
offered
to
drop
me
here
on
his
way
to
the
country
club
i
remember
the
exact
time
did
not
consult
my
watch
you
came
directly
from
the
road
into
the
house
judge
marshall
certainly
sir
did
you
er
see
anyone
you
mean
sir
did
anyone
see
judge
marshall
demanded
with
pompous
indignation
no
no
one
sir
if
my
word
is
not
good
enough
for
you
you
can
think
what
you
damned
please
i
think
we
are
all
getting
a
little
too
tired
dundee
penny
crain
suggested
almost
humble
in
her
weariness
i
truly
sorry
the
young
detective
apologized
but
i
ca
leave
things
like
this
drake
you
have
said
you
walked
over
from
the
country
club
you
must
have
approached
the
house
from
the
driveway
side
the
side
of
the
house
which
contains
selim
bedroom
is
that
right
more
or
less
except
that
i
skirted
the
house
rather
widely
and
arrived
from
the
road
stepping
upon
the
front
porch
and
walking
directly
into
the
hall
i
saw
no
one
outside
or
near
the
house
when
i
arrived
drake
answered
with
less
than
his
usual
nastiness
and
saw
no
one
running
away
across
the
meadows
dundee
pressed
no
one
at
all
drake
retorted
i
wish
to
god
i
could
truthfully
say
that
i
saw
a
gunman
with
a
mask
and
a
smoking
revolver
skulking
through
the
wildflowers
but
the
absolute
truth
is
that
i
saw
no
one
thank
you
drake
now
sprague
new
york
sprague
nervously
twitching
face
reddened
darkly
i
i
took
a
bus
i
have
no
car
of
my
own
i
got
off
the
bus
on
sheridan
road
at
the
entrance
to
primrose
meadows
i
see
and
you
walked
the
quarter
of
a
mile
to
this
house
sprague
hand
fumbled
with
his
cravat
i
of
course
i
did
i
see
now
miss
raymond
dundee
pounced
unexpectedly
so
that
the
girl
went
very
white
beneath
her
freckles
you
observed
sprague
toiling
down
the
rutty
road
hot
and
weary
but
romantic
in
the
sunset
drake
let
out
a
nervous
giggle
then
clapped
her
hand
over
her
mouth
i
i
was
looking
that
way
janet
raymond
stammered
i
i
just
went
out
on
the
porch
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
you
were
surprised
when
sprague
came
walking
up
the
flagstone
path
dundee
persisted
for
he
knew
she
was
lying
knew
that
she
had
stationed
herself
there
to
watch
for
sprague
i
yes
i
was
he
stopped
and
talked
for
a
while
before
we
came
in
and
joined
tracey
and
lois
in
the
dining
room
where
tracey
was
mixing
cocktails
but
she
flared
suddenly
i
do
see
why
you
have
to
badger
all
of
us
when
it
have
been
lydia
the
maid
who
killed
nita
because
oh
janet
shame
on
you
penny
cried
furiously
where
is
the
maid
now
captain
strawn
dundee
asked
i
have
seen
her
yet
because
she
in
her
room
in
the
basement
bonnie
strawn
answered
sort
of
forgot
about
her
did
you
and
he
chuckled
at
the
younger
man
discomfiture
but
got
her
story
out
of
her
you
bet
nothing
to
it
though
one
of
my
boys
collins
it
was
found
her
in
that
short
dark
hall
that
runs
between
the
selim
woman
bedroom
and
the
kitchen
a
pup
she
was
it
was
a
mess
said
she
i
better
have
her
up
and
question
her
if
she
well
enough
dundee
interrupted
as
tactfully
as
possible
it
seems
that
she
had
an
abscessed
tooth
out
today
with
gas
and
a
local
anesthetic
now
miss
raymond
will
you
tell
me
exactly
what
you
meant
by
saying
it
must
have
been
lydia
who
killed
her
mistress
i
certainly
will
the
girl
cried
defiantly
what
i
see
is
why
tracey
and
lois
and
dex
sprague
did
think
of
it
too
it
as
plain
as
yes
as
the
nose
on
my
face
dundee
cut
in
grimly
but
with
a
glance
at
strawn
just
stick
to
the
facts
however
miss
raymond
and
maybe
we
can
all
agree
with
you
well
when
sprague
and
i
went
into
the
dining
room
there
were
lois
and
tracey
cutting
up
like
a
couple
of
children
janet
began
determined
to
take
her
time
when
they
saw
us
lois
said
lord
tracey
get
busy
or
your
job
as
bartender
will
be
taken
away
from
you
and
tracey
began
to
shake
cocktails
at
the
sideboard
guess
i
better
tell
it
janet
for
what
it
worth
lois
cut
in
impatiently
it
nothing
more
nor
less
than
that
i
had
to
ring
twice
for
poor
lydia
before
she
came
she
explained
to
dundee
tracey
is
full
of
original
ideas
about
cocktails
and
wanted
some
sort
of
bitters
he
was
going
to
shout
for
lydia
but
i
stepped
on
the
button
under
the
dining
table
and
the
poor
thing
in
the
basement
nursing
her
jaw
probably
did
hear
tracey
and
i
got
to
kidding
as
janet
says
and
had
scarcely
noticed
how
long
lydia
was
in
coming
i
rang
again
and
she
came
that
all
that
is
all
janet
denied
angrily
i
was
there
when
lydia
came
in
and
she
was
looking
white
as
a
ghost
except
for
her
swollen
jaw
what
more
she
acted
so
dumb
tracey
had
to
tell
her
twice
what
he
wanted
and
then
she
said
nita
did
have
any
of
those
bitters
anyway
an
case
against
poor
lydia
penny
crain
broke
in
derisively
go
pluck
daisies
janet
you
be
of
a
lot
more
help
here
your
maid
bonnie
captain
strawn
announced
lazily
as
one
of
his
plainclothesmen
appeared
in
the
arch
between
dining
and
living
room
dragging
by
the
hand
a
woman
who
was
resisting
strangely
her
apron
pressed
to
her
face
you
are
lydia
dundee
asked
his
voice
kinder
than
it
had
been
for
many
minutes
oh
it
lydia
carr
captain
strawn
thank
you
be
afraid
and
i
sorry
about
the
tooth
come
along
in
i
not
keep
you
long
the
woman
knees
seemed
about
to
fail
her
but
with
a
sudden
effort
she
released
the
detective
grip
on
her
wrist
very
tall
she
was
very
bony
in
her
black
cotton
dress
pathetic
too
with
her
thin
hair
and
that
apron
concealing
the
left
half
of
her
face
it
was
odd
dundee
thought
that
it
was
not
the
swollen
jaw
she
chose
to
cover
dunlap
sprang
to
her
feet
and
hurried
across
the
room
do
mind
lydia
please
you
must
not
be
so
sensitive
she
said
gently
and
even
more
gently
pulled
down
the
concealing
apron
good
god
dundee
breathed
and
strawn
nodded
his
understanding
of
the
younger
man
horror
for
the
left
half
of
lydia
carr
face
was
drawn
and
puckered
and
ridged
almost
out
of
human
semblance
even
the
eye
was
ruined
a
milky
ball
which
the
puckered
hairless
eyelid
could
never
cover
again
poor
lydia
is
ashamed
of
her
scarred
face
lois
dunlap
explained
her
arm
still
about
the
maid
shoulder
she
is
quite
used
to
it
yet
but
none
of
mind
you
were
burned
recently
lydia
dundee
asked
pityingly
that
my
business
the
woman
astounded
him
by
retorting
harshly
how
did
it
happen
lydia
dundee
persisted
puzzled
i
had
an
accident
it
was
my
own
fault
lois
dunlap
kind
grey
eyes
caught
and
held
dundee
firmly
i
think
if
nita
could
speak
to
you
now
dundee
that
she
would
beg
you
not
to
try
to
force
lydia
confidence
on
this
subject
nita
was
devoted
to
lydia
we
can
all
testify
to
that
and
one
of
the
sweetest
things
about
her
was
her
constant
effort
to
protect
lydia
from
questions
and
curious
glances
i
for
one
know
that
nita
often
begged
lydia
to
submit
to
a
operation
regardless
of
expense
when
that
kind
voice
choked
on
tears
dundee
abruptly
abandoned
his
intention
to
press
the
matter
further
lydia
your
mistress
had
been
married
or
was
still
married
she
the
woman
single
eye
stared
into
his
expressionlessly
she
had
in
front
of
her
name
to
use
when
she
felt
like
it
that
all
i
know
i
never
saw
her
husband
if
she
had
one
i
only
worked
for
her
about
five
years
you
say
she
used
her
married
name
she
felt
like
it
what
do
you
mean
by
that
lydia
i
mean
she
was
an
actress
and
used
her
stage
name
juanita
leigh
pronounced
like
it
was
spelled
plain
but
she
was
mostly
called
leigh
an
actress
you
say
dundee
repeated
thoughtfully
i
had
heard
of
her
only
as
director
of
the
forsyte
school
plays
what
shows
was
she
in
she
was
what
they
call
a
specialty
dancer
in
musical
comedy
lydia
answered
sometimes
she
had
a
real
part
and
sometimes
she
only
danced
she
was
a
good
hoofer
and
a
good
trouper
she
added
the
broadway
terms
falling
strangely
from
those
austere
lips
and
when
she
was
in
a
show
she
sometimes
got
a
job
in
the
pictures
she
never
had
a
real
chance
in
the
movies
though
because
they
mostly
wanted
her
to
double
for
the
star
in
long
shots
where
dancing
comes
into
the
picture
or
in
where
they
just
show
the
legs
you
know
i
see
dundee
agreed
gravely
where
were
you
during
the
fifteen
minutes
or
so
before
your
mistress
was
shot
lydia
i
was
down
in
my
room
in
the
basement
the
woman
answered
nita
i
mean
miss
nita
was
going
to
get
judge
marshall
to
build
me
a
room
on
the
top
floor
she
hated
for
me
to
have
to
sleep
in
the
basement
but
i
did
mind
you
were
not
required
to
be
on
duty
for
the
party
no
she
answered
in
her
harsh
flat
voice
i
fixed
the
sandwiches
and
put
out
the
liquors
for
the
cocktails
set
them
all
out
on
the
dining
table
and
sideboard
and
miss
nita
had
told
me
to
go
and
lie
down
as
soon
as
i
was
through
so
i
did
i
had
an
abscessed
tooth
pulled
this
morning
and
i
was
feeling
sick
did
you
hear
the
kitchen
bell
at
all
dundee
went
on
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
that
fool
dentist
had
shot
me
full
of
dope
but
i
did
hear
the
bell
and
i
come
up
to
answer
it
dunlap
said
rung
twice
and
i
said
i
was
sorry
lydia
did
you
go
into
your
mistress
bedroom
before
or
after
you
answered
that
bell
dundee
asked
with
sudden
sharpness
i
did
not
i
did
even
know
she
was
in
her
bedroom
until
i
saw
her
sitting
at
her
dead
the
harsh
voice
hesitated
over
the
last
word
but
it
did
not
break
and
just
when
did
you
first
see
her
after
she
was
dead
i
went
into
the
kitchen
thinking
something
else
might
be
needed
then
i
heard
a
scream
it
sounded
like
it
come
from
nita
miss
bedroom
and
i
run
along
the
back
hall
that
leads
from
the
kitchen
to
her
bedroom
i
heard
a
lot
of
people
running
and
yelling
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
me
you
came
into
the
room
no
sir
i
did
not
i
stopped
in
the
doorway
i
heard
sprague
say
she
was
dead
i
was
sick
and
dizzy
anyway
and
i
could
move
for
a
minute
i
sort
of
slipped
down
to
the
floor
and
i
guess
i
must
have
passed
out
and
then
i
was
sick
to
my
stomach
and
i
did
seem
to
care
if
i
never
moved
again
why
lydia
dundee
asked
gently
because
she
was
the
only
friend
i
had
in
the
world
and
i
could
have
loved
her
better
if
she
been
my
own
child
lydia
answered
and
the
stern
voice
had
broken
at
last
i
was
still
there
in
the
back
hall
when
a
cop
come
and
asked
me
a
lot
of
questions
and
then
that
man
she
pointed
to
captain
strawn
said
i
could
go
and
lay
down
he
helped
me
down
the
basement
stairs
dundee
tapped
his
teeth
with
the
long
pencil
he
had
kept
so
busy
that
evening
tapped
them
long
and
thoughtfully
then
lydia
did
you
see
anyone
at
all
from
your
basement
room
window
before
you
answered
dunlap
ring
chapter
nine
for
the
first
time
during
the
difficult
interview
dundee
was
sure
that
lydia
carr
was
lying
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
her
single
eye
wavered
the
lid
flickered
then
came
her
harsh
flat
denial
i
did
see
nobody
i
presume
your
basement
room
has
a
window
looking
out
upon
the
back
garden
dundee
persisted
yes
it
has
but
i
did
waste
no
time
looking
out
of
it
lydia
answered
grimly
i
was
laying
down
with
an
ice
cap
against
my
jaw
she
seen
someone
dundee
told
himself
but
the
truth
would
be
harder
to
extract
from
that
stern
mouth
than
the
abscessed
tooth
had
been
finally
when
her
lone
eye
did
not
again
waver
under
his
steady
gaze
he
dismissed
her
or
rather
returned
her
to
captain
strawn
custody
well
janet
i
hope
you
satisfied
penny
crain
said
bitingly
as
she
dashed
unashamed
tears
from
her
brown
eyes
if
ever
a
maid
was
absolutely
crazy
about
her
mistress
i
satisfied
janet
raymond
retorted
furiously
she
just
the
sort
that
would
harbor
a
grudge
for
and
then
all
hopped
up
with
dope
stop
it
janet
lois
dunlap
commanded
with
a
curtness
that
set
oddly
upon
her
kind
pleasant
face
listen
here
dundee
tracey
miles
broke
in
almost
humbly
my
wife
is
getting
pretty
anxious
about
the
kiddies
the
nurse
quit
on
us
yesterday
and
and
little
wife
is
worrying
herself
sick
over
our
boy
just
three
months
old
judge
marshall
joined
the
protest
i
all
for
assisting
justice
sir
having
served
on
the
bench
myself
as
you
doubtless
know
but
i
all
right
really
hugo
karen
marshall
faltered
please
be
patient
a
little
longer
dundee
urged
apologetically
after
all
only
one
of
these
people
could
be
guilty
of
nita
selim
murder
and
it
beastly
to
have
to
hold
them
like
this
one
was
guilty
you
knew
selim
in
new
york
sprague
he
asked
whirling
suddenly
upon
the
man
with
the
broadway
stamp
i
met
nita
leigh
as
i
always
heard
her
called
when
i
was
assistant
director
in
the
altamont
studios
out
on
long
island
sprague
answered
his
black
eyes
trying
to
meet
dundee
with
an
air
of
complete
frankness
wonderful
little
girl
and
a
great
dancer
screened
damned
well
too
i
had
hoped
to
give
her
a
break
some
day
at
something
better
than
doubling
for
stars
who
ca
dance
but
it
happened
that
nita
who
never
forgot
even
a
casual
friend
had
a
chance
to
give
me
a
leg
up
herself
a
chance
to
show
what
i
can
really
do
with
a
camera
i
knew
i
seen
your
name
somewhere
dundee
exclaimed
so
you
the
man
the
chamber
of
commerce
is
dickering
with
going
to
make
a
movie
of
the
founding
growth
and
beauties
of
the
city
of
hamilton
you
if
i
get
the
contract
yes
sprague
answered
with
palpably
assumed
modesty
my
plans
naturally
call
for
a
great
deal
of
research
work
a
large
expenditure
of
money
a
very
careful
selection
of
i
see
dundee
interrupted
then
his
tone
changed
became
slow
and
menacing
in
its
terrible
emphasis
you
really
could
let
even
a
good
friend
like
nita
selim
upset
those
fine
plans
of
yours
could
you
sprague
even
as
he
put
the
sinister
question
the
detective
was
exulting
to
himself
light
at
last
now
i
know
why
this
broadway
bounder
was
received
into
an
exclusive
crowd
like
this
every
last
female
in
the
bunch
hoped
to
be
the
star
of
sprague
motion
picture
i
do
know
what
you
driving
at
dundee
sprague
was
on
his
feet
his
black
eyes
blazing
out
of
a
chalky
face
if
you
accusing
me
of
of
of
killing
nita
selim
dundee
asked
lazily
oh
no
not
yet
sprague
i
was
just
remembering
a
rather
puzzling
note
of
yours
i
happened
to
read
this
afternoon
that
note
you
sent
by
special
messenger
to
breakaway
inn
this
noon
you
know
he
had
little
interest
for
the
sudden
crumpling
of
dexter
sprague
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
risen
instead
as
dundee
drew
the
note
from
his
coat
pocket
his
eyes
swept
around
the
room
noted
the
undisguised
relief
on
every
face
the
almost
ghoulish
satisfaction
with
which
that
group
of
friends
seized
upon
an
outsider
as
the
probable
murderer
of
that
other
outsider
whom
they
had
rashly
taken
into
their
sacred
circle
even
penny
crain
thorny
little
stickler
for
fair
play
that
she
was
relaxed
with
a
tremulous
sigh
you
admit
that
this
note
signed
by
what
i
take
to
be
your
name
was
written
by
your
hand
sprague
dundee
asked
as
he
extended
the
sheet
of
bluish
notepaper
i
no
yes
i
wrote
it
sprague
faltered
but
it
does
mean
a
thing
not
a
damned
thing
just
a
little
private
matter
between
nita
and
myself
rather
queer
wording
for
an
unimportant
message
sprague
dundee
interrupted
let
me
refresh
your
memory
my
sweet
he
began
to
read
slowly
your
bad
boy
for
last
night
row
but
i
warn
you
again
to
watch
your
step
you
already
gone
too
far
of
course
i
love
you
and
understand
be
good
baby
you
be
dexy
well
sprague
sprague
wiped
his
perspiring
hands
on
his
handkerchief
i
know
it
sounds
odd
under
the
circumstances
he
admitted
desperately
but
listen
dundee
and
i
try
to
make
that
damned
note
as
clear
as
possible
to
a
man
who
does
know
his
broadway
why
man
it
even
a
love
letter
everybody
on
broadway
talks
and
writes
to
each
other
like
that
without
meaning
a
thing
as
i
told
you
nita
leigh
or
selim
remembered
some
little
kindnesses
i
had
done
her
on
the
altamont
lot
when
they
got
her
to
take
up
that
little
theater
work
dunlap
is
interested
in
and
found
that
the
chamber
of
commerce
was
interested
in
putting
hamilton
into
the
movies
in
a
big
booster
campaign
she
wired
me
and
i
thought
it
looked
good
enough
to
drop
everything
and
come
of
course
nita
and
i
got
to
be
closer
friends
but
i
swear
to
god
we
were
just
friends
and
what
was
the
row
about
last
night
sprague
there
was
a
row
really
sprague
protested
with
desperate
earnestness
it
was
merely
that
nita
insisted
on
my
casting
her
for
the
heroine
of
the
movie
a
thing
i
knew
would
alienate
the
whole
crowd
that
been
so
kind
to
us
why
since
she
was
a
professional
actress
dundee
demanded
because
she
is
a
hamilton
girl
of
course
and
the
chamber
of
commerce
wants
the
cast
to
be
all
local
talent
sprague
answered
lapsing
unconsciously
into
the
present
tense
and
just
what
were
you
warning
her
against
i
told
her
before
to
watch
her
step
sprague
went
on
more
easily
you
see
dundee
nita
leigh
is
was
a
little
vamp
and
i
could
see
she
was
playing
her
cards
with
the
men
here
he
indicated
four
of
hamilton
most
prominent
chamber
of
commerce
members
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
to
get
them
all
so
crazy
about
her
that
they
vote
for
her
as
the
star
of
the
picture
i
could
see
her
point
all
right
it
would
have
been
a
big
chance
for
her
to
show
how
she
could
act
well
i
could
see
it
was
dangerous
business
and
that
the
girls
and
he
smiled
jerkily
at
the
tense
women
in
the
living
room
were
getting
pretty
wrought
up
over
the
way
nita
was
behaving
all
except
dunlap
he
added
did
want
to
act
in
the
picture
and
nita
did
make
any
headway
at
all
with
peter
dunlap
thanks
sprague
lois
dunlap
drawled
with
an
amused
quirk
of
her
broad
mouth
get
along
with
the
row
sprague
dundee
commanded
impatiently
as
i
said
it
was
really
a
row
i
just
pleaded
with
nita
last
night
to
smooth
down
the
girls
rumpled
feathers
and
to
make
it
clear
to
them
that
she
did
want
the
star
part
in
the
picture
any
more
than
she
wanted
any
other
woman
husband
or
sweetheart
just
a
friendly
warning
sprague
drew
a
deep
breath
and
that
all
the
note
meant
absolutely
i
see
dundee
said
quietly
then
quoted
good
baby
and
you
wo
be
sorry
that
meant
of
course
sprague
took
him
up
eagerly
that
i
see
she
got
a
real
part
in
a
regular
movie
after
i
made
my
hit
with
the
hamilton
picture
very
plausible
very
plausible
indeed
dundee
reflected
and
yet
finally
he
lifted
his
head
and
let
his
eyes
dart
from
face
to
face
all
of
you
have
stated
separately
and
collectively
that
you
heard
no
shot
fired
in
nita
selim
bedroom
this
afternoon
he
said
sharply
is
that
true
he
was
answered
by
weary
nods
or
sullen
affirmations
then
he
continued
i
must
conclude
that
you
are
all
lying
or
that
nita
selim
was
killed
with
a
gun
equipped
with
a
maxim
silencer
never
was
a
detective
more
unprepared
for
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
a
group
of
possible
suspects
than
was
special
investigator
dundee
chapter
ten
as
dexter
sprague
had
glibly
and
plausibly
explained
away
every
sinister
aspect
of
the
note
he
had
written
to
nita
selim
that
day
special
investigator
dundee
was
recalling
with
verbatim
vividness
his
argument
with
captain
strawn
of
the
homicide
squad
immediately
after
his
arrival
into
the
house
of
violent
death
he
had
said
then
the
person
who
killed
nita
selim
was
so
well
known
to
her
and
his
or
her
presence
in
this
room
so
natural
a
thing
that
she
paid
no
attention
to
his
or
her
movements
and
was
concentrating
on
the
job
of
powdering
her
very
pretty
face
and
he
had
said
further
in
face
of
the
disappearance
of
the
gun
and
in
explanation
of
the
fact
that
all
twelve
of
these
people
had
immediately
protested
to
strawn
that
they
had
heard
no
shot
this
was
a
premeditated
murder
of
course
the
maxim
silencer
unless
they
are
all
lying
about
not
hearing
a
shot
proves
that
silencers
are
damned
hard
to
get
hold
of
but
people
with
plenty
of
money
can
manage
most
things
and
as
dexter
sprague
had
talked
on
more
and
more
glibly
dundee
had
suddenly
found
an
explanation
which
fitted
his
own
argument
with
such
perfection
that
he
wondered
naïvely
if
he
were
perhaps
gifted
with
clairvoyance
of
all
these
twelve
people
whom
he
had
questioned
so
relentlessly
only
dexter
sprague
could
easily
have
come
into
possession
of
a
maxim
silencer
he
had
dilated
proudly
upon
the
fact
that
he
had
been
an
assistant
director
at
the
altamont
studios
on
long
island
and
the
altamont
company
had
recently
finished
making
a
series
of
underworld
motion
pictures
crook
dramas
featuring
gunmen
with
rods
made
eerily
noiseless
by
maxim
silencers
a
bit
of
information
he
had
picked
up
in
a
motion
picture
magazine
had
hurtled
into
the
logical
chain
of
dundee
reasoning
assistant
directors
were
in
charge
of
props
it
was
their
business
to
see
that
no
article
needed
for
the
production
of
a
picture
was
lost
or
missing
when
the
director
needed
it
dexter
sprague
had
said
that
he
had
dropped
everything
to
come
when
nita
selim
wired
him
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
project
to
make
a
booster
movie
of
hamilton
perhaps
he
dropped
everything
but
he
hesitated
long
enough
to
pick
up
a
maxim
silencer
and
a
and
was
the
row
which
sprague
had
been
so
glibly
explaining
away
an
ancient
one
a
row
so
deadly
that
when
nita
selim
had
refused
to
heed
his
written
warning
her
murder
had
become
necessary
it
was
with
all
this
in
mind
that
bonnie
dundee
flung
his
challenge
i
must
conclude
that
you
are
all
lying
or
that
nita
selim
was
killed
with
a
gun
equipped
with
a
maxim
silencer
and
his
eyes
terrible
with
their
command
that
the
weakling
should
break
and
confess
were
upon
dexter
sprague
but
sprague
did
not
break
he
stared
back
blankly
if
his
eyes
and
his
attention
had
included
the
whole
group
it
is
possible
that
what
happened
would
not
have
taken
dundee
so
completely
by
surprise
he
had
paid
little
attention
to
a
sort
of
concerted
gasp
a
slight
movement
among
the
group
farthest
from
him
but
not
even
his
intense
concentration
upon
sprague
could
prevent
his
hearing
karen
marshall
childish
voice
tremulous
with
fear
no
no
hugo
do
do
he
whirled
from
sprague
in
time
to
see
judge
marshall
disengaging
his
arm
from
his
young
wife
clinging
fingers
to
note
with
profound
astonishment
that
drake
was
stepping
hastily
aside
so
that
not
even
his
coat
sleeve
might
be
brushed
by
the
advancing
figure
of
the
elderly
retired
judge
and
before
judge
marshall
had
time
to
speak
dundee
saw
that
a
blight
had
touched
at
last
the
solid
friendship
of
the
women
that
they
did
not
look
at
each
other
with
that
air
of
standing
together
whatever
happened
but
that
their
eyes
not
meeting
at
all
became
secret
calculating
afraid
sir
judge
marshall
began
pompously
when
he
had
planted
himself
squarely
before
the
young
detective
it
shall
never
be
said
of
me
that
i
have
tried
even
in
the
slightest
way
to
hamper
the
course
of
justice
i
am
sure
of
that
judge
marshall
dundee
replied
courteously
but
his
pulses
were
hammering
what
in
god
name
did
this
old
fool
have
to
tell
him
you
have
some
information
you
believe
may
be
valuable
judge
i
do
not
believe
it
will
be
at
all
valuable
sir
on
the
contrary
the
old
man
retorted
indignantly
but
to
suppress
the
fact
at
this
juncture
might
lead
to
grave
misunderstandings
later
when
it
inevitably
comes
to
light
so
sir
it
is
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
i
myself
own
a
as
well
as
a
maxim
silencer
what
dundee
exclaimed
incredulously
he
was
conscious
that
behind
him
captain
strawn
was
getting
to
his
feet
there
is
no
need
to
get
out
your
handcuffs
captain
strawn
judge
marshall
warned
him
majestically
i
assure
you
that
i
have
not
violated
the
law
every
judge
active
and
retired
is
entitled
to
a
permit
to
carry
a
weapon
and
i
long
ago
availed
myself
of
the
privilege
nor
am
i
about
to
make
a
confession
of
murder
there
ai
no
permit
so
far
as
i
know
judge
strawn
growled
for
any
man
whoever
he
may
be
god
himself
not
excepted
to
tote
a
gun
with
a
silencer
on
it
karen
marshall
was
crying
now
with
the
abandoned
grief
of
a
petted
child
granted
captain
judge
marshall
snapped
but
it
happens
that
i
do
not
my
gun
with
the
silencer
on
it
if
it
interests
you
i
may
as
well
explain
that
i
came
by
the
silencer
several
years
ago
when
i
was
on
the
bench
a
notorious
chicago
gunman
on
trial
for
murder
here
and
acquitted
by
a
jury
made
me
a
present
of
the
very
silencer
he
had
used
in
killing
his
victim
an
ironic
gesture
a
gesture
of
supreme
insolence
but
an
entirely
safe
gesture
since
he
well
knew
that
a
man
once
acquitted
of
a
crime
can
not
again
be
placed
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offence
so
you
kept
the
silencer
as
a
curiosity
judge
marshall
dundee
interrupted
the
pompous
flow
of
rhetoric
for
years
yes
the
answered
then
his
face
went
yellow
and
very
old
as
i
told
you
just
now
i
will
withhold
no
fact
that
may
be
of
any
relevance
whatever
about
two
months
ago
in
march
i
believe
our
little
group
here
took
up
as
a
fad
several
of
us
became
quite
expert
with
revolver
and
rifle
drake
and
he
nodded
toward
the
banker
who
instantly
averted
his
eyes
conceived
the
idea
of
practising
the
sort
of
the
kind
one
sees
in
wild
west
movies
you
know
i
think
you
might
add
hugo
drake
cut
in
angrily
that
i
had
in
mind
the
hope
of
being
able
to
protect
the
bank
in
case
of
a
holdup
and
the
silencer
judge
marshall
captain
strawn
prodded
judge
marshall
flushed
and
fingered
the
end
of
a
waxed
mustache
the
silencer
sir
was
my
wife
idea
you
see
sir
we
are
fortunate
enough
to
be
the
parents
of
an
infant
son
he
was
just
a
month
old
when
i
painted
a
bull
eye
upon
the
brick
wall
of
our
back
garden
and
invited
our
friends
to
indulge
their
fad
as
our
guests
the
shooting
awakened
the
baby
so
frequently
that
karen
marshall
dug
up
the
silencer
which
i
had
shown
her
as
a
memento
of
my
career
on
the
bench
thereafter
we
confined
our
practice
almost
exclusively
to
drawing
from
the
hip
and
shooting
without
sighting
it
is
impossible
to
sight
with
a
gun
equipped
with
a
silencer
you
know
since
the
silencer
covers
the
sighter
on
the
barrel
it
sure
does
strawn
drawled
so
every
last
one
of
you
folks
had
a
good
deal
of
this
sort
of
practice
i
take
it
judge
marshall
glanced
about
the
room
as
if
he
could
not
recall
the
face
of
everyone
present
yes
all
of
us
except
sprague
and
penny
my
dear
did
you
join
us
at
all
the
girl
who
had
once
been
in
on
every
sport
that
this
crowd
of
hamilton
socially
elect
indulged
in
flushed
a
painful
red
no
hugo
i
i
have
to
stay
with
mother
on
sunday
mornings
you
know
your
target
practice
was
a
sunday
morning
diversion
then
judge
marshall
dundee
asked
yes
we
usually
have
an
hour
of
the
sport
between
eleven
and
noon
on
sundays
we
been
having
a
sort
of
tournament
quite
sharply
competitive
when
did
you
and
your
friends
practise
last
dundee
asked
last
sunday
tomorrow
was
to
mark
the
end
of
the
the
judge
answered
and
when
did
you
last
see
your
gun
and
silencer
dundee
persisted
last
sunday
of
course
why
good
lord
marshall
ejaculated
it
was
nita
herself
who
put
the
gun
away
there
was
a
collective
gasp
of
relief
eyes
could
meet
eyes
now
but
it
was
flora
miles
who
voiced
the
thought
or
hope
that
seemed
apparent
on
every
face
that
why
i
did
hear
anyone
talking
when
i
was
in
the
closet
she
cried
her
voice
almost
hysterical
in
its
vehemence
anybody
but
nita
in
the
room
she
committed
suicide
she
stole
poor
hugo
gun
and
the
silencer
and
committed
suicide
at
a
distance
of
from
ten
to
fifteen
feet
dundee
asked
with
sarcasm
and
when
she
was
powdering
her
face
and
just
after
entering
the
room
blithely
singing
a
broadway
hit
maybe
the
lady
is
right
boy
captain
strawn
interposed
mildly
heard
of
people
rigging
up
contrivances
which
make
the
gun
and
the
silencer
disappear
by
magic
dundee
demanded
no
folks
i
afraid
the
suicide
theory
is
no
good
now
judge
marshall
and
he
turned
again
to
the
creator
of
the
biggest
sensation
since
the
investigation
into
nita
selim
death
had
got
under
way
you
say
that
selim
herself
put
the
gun
away
will
you
explain
the
circumstances
the
elderly
man
face
had
gone
yellowish
again
certainly
nita
selim
and
i
were
the
last
to
leave
the
back
garden
she
was
particularly
poor
at
the
sport
never
made
a
bull
eye
during
the
four
or
five
sunday
mornings
after
lois
dunlap
drew
her
into
our
set
she
begged
for
a
few
more
shots
and
i
stayed
with
her
after
the
others
had
gone
into
the
house
for
er
refreshment
she
fired
the
last
bullet
in
the
chamber
of
the
colt
and
together
we
walked
to
the
house
entering
the
little
room
at
the
rear
where
all
sorts
of
sports
equipment
are
kept
fishing
rods
and
tackle
golf
clubs
bows
and
arrows
skis
etc
she
was
carrying
the
gun
unscrewing
the
silencer
as
we
walked
it
is
my
habit
to
keep
the
pistol
and
the
silencer
in
a
drawer
in
a
little
corner
cupboard
locked
up
dundee
asked
sharply
usually
locked
but
not
always
i
am
afraid
judge
marshall
answered
reluctantly
and
you
saw
selim
place
the
gun
and
the
silencer
in
the
drawer
i
thought
i
did
but
i
was
really
not
watching
closely
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
stopped
to
look
over
a
fishing
rod
with
a
view
to
trying
it
out
the
first
good
fishing
weather
was
selim
wearing
a
coat
or
cloak
dundee
cut
in
impatiently
why
i
do
know
yes
she
was
hugo
karen
cried
out
eagerly
it
was
quite
chilly
last
sunday
morning
remember
we
all
had
on
coats
or
sweaters
nita
wore
a
leather
jacket
with
big
pockets
and
she
left
in
a
great
hurry
without
even
waiting
for
a
drink
flora
miles
contributed
triumphantly
i
tell
you
she
took
them
away
in
her
pockets
your
guess
may
be
correct
mrs
miles
dundee
agreed
but
i
think
we
had
better
not
come
to
any
definite
conclusion
until
we
know
that
judge
marshall
automatic
and
silencer
are
really
missing
is
there
anyone
at
your
house
now
judge
whom
you
can
ask
to
look
for
it
certainly
the
butler
shall
i
telephone
him
accompanied
by
captain
strawn
the
went
to
the
telephone
in
the
little
foyer
between
nita
selim
bedroom
and
the
main
hall
and
within
five
minutes
he
was
back
nodding
his
head
gravely
hinson
tells
me
that
the
colt
and
the
silencer
are
both
missing
sir
may
i
express
my
profound
regret
that
my
possession
of
some
other
time
judge
marshall
dundee
interrupted
curtly
and
hurried
from
the
room
followed
by
strawn
who
nodded
to
sergeant
turner
still
lounging
wearily
in
a
far
corner
of
the
living
room
to
stand
guard
vigilantly
well
bonnie
here
the
devil
to
pay
strawn
gloomed
but
dundee
made
for
the
telephone
without
answering
he
called
a
number
then
curtly
demanded
price
please
yes
i
know
he
busy
on
an
autopsy
just
tell
him
that
dundee
of
the
district
attorney
office
wants
to
speak
to
him
there
was
a
long
pause
then
hello
dr
price
dundee
what
are
the
caliber
and
type
of
bullet
that
killed
nita
selim
thanks
much
doctor
anything
new
fine
thanks
again
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
faced
strawn
bullet
from
a
colt
he
said
grimly
i
suggest
you
send
one
of
your
men
around
to
the
marshall
home
to
pick
up
a
bullet
that
was
shot
in
their
damned
target
practice
if
you
send
the
two
bullets
tonight
registered
mail
to
wright
the
ballistics
expert
in
chicago
he
can
probably
wire
you
tomorrow
morning
as
to
whether
the
same
gun
was
used
to
fire
both
sure
bonnie
strawn
agreed
lugubriously
i
was
going
to
do
just
that
say
this
town
is
getting
to
be
worse
than
chicago
when
he
the
living
room
dundee
began
upon
the
judge
again
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
elderly
husband
was
murmuring
consolatory
endearments
to
his
young
wife
judge
marshall
how
many
keys
are
there
to
the
cupboard
drawer
in
which
your
gun
and
silencer
were
kept
just
one
i
have
it
with
me
the
old
man
answered
wearily
then
when
hinson
your
butler
looked
for
them
he
found
the
drawer
unlocked
he
did
i
confess
to
almost
criminal
negligence
then
so
far
as
you
know
the
gun
and
silencer
could
have
been
removed
at
any
time
by
any
guest
of
yours
between
noon
last
sunday
and
today
dundee
went
on
relentlessly
i
suppose
so
but
these
people
have
been
my
close
friends
for
years
the
judge
answered
not
one
of
them
sir
after
selim
departure
last
sunday
did
your
other
guests
remain
for
any
length
of
time
for
an
hour
or
more
i
think
lois
and
peter
dunlap
remained
for
our
two
sunday
dinner
but
the
others
drifted
away
to
various
engagements
did
any
of
you
return
to
the
room
where
the
gun
was
kept
i
can
speak
only
for
myself
and
peter
dunlap
judge
marshall
answered
flushing
with
indignation
the
two
of
us
went
down
just
before
dinner
was
served
i
wanted
to
show
him
some
new
flies
for
trout
casting
your
home
is
a
popular
rendezvous
for
your
intimates
is
it
not
i
pride
myself
that
it
is
sir
and
guests
run
in
and
out
having
the
freedom
of
the
place
certainly
sir
and
since
i
am
not
so
stupid
as
you
imagine
i
can
tell
you
now
that
i
understand
the
drift
of
your
questions
and
can
forestall
them
yes
all
of
these
people
have
had
opportunity
to
take
the
gun
and
the
silencer
from
the
cupboard
since
it
was
placed
there
last
sunday
if
it
placed
there
by
selim
but
may
i
remind
you
sir
that
opportunity
alone
is
not
sufficient
that
since
selim
is
dead
murdered
by
the
weapon
which
was
stolen
we
can
assume
judge
marshall
that
someone
had
motive
dundee
reminded
him
implacably
for
in
his
mind
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
ballistics
expert
would
bear
him
out
there
was
a
heavy
throbbing
silence
the
group
that
with
the
exception
of
dexter
sprague
had
been
so
united
so
cemented
with
friendship
again
dissolved
visibly
before
dundee
eyes
into
eleven
individuals
each
shrinking
into
himself
mentally
drawing
away
from
any
possible
contamination
with
a
murderer
you
have
said
judge
marshall
dundee
went
on
at
last
that
miss
crain
and
sprague
were
not
at
your
home
for
target
practice
sunday
has
either
of
them
been
in
your
home
during
this
past
week
penny
miss
crain
spent
an
evening
with
my
wife
when
i
was
er
away
from
home
on
business
that
was
last
tuesday
i
believe
yes
it
was
tuesday
hugo
penny
crain
interrupted
firmly
and
karen
can
vouch
for
the
fact
that
i
did
not
go
into
the
gun
room
do
be
silly
penny
carolyn
drake
scolded
as
if
she
had
long
been
bursting
to
speak
giving
an
alibi
as
if
of
us
who
were
playing
bridge
while
that
woman
was
being
shot
any
alibi
but
tell
you
what
think
detective
i
think
nita
herself
stole
the
gun
and
the
silencer
to
kill
dexter
sprague
with
and
that
stole
it
from
her
and
murdered
nobody
else
has
the
slightest
scrap
of
a
motive
and
that
note
he
wrote
her
ought
to
be
enough
to
hang
him
on
dexter
sprague
had
struggled
to
his
feet
during
the
woman
hysterical
attack
his
face
like
chalk
his
eyes
blazing
but
dundee
waved
him
aside
peremptorily
one
more
question
judge
marshall
he
said
suavely
as
if
he
had
not
heard
a
word
that
carolyn
drake
had
said
you
knew
selim
before
her
arrival
in
hamilton
with
dunlap
i
believe
just
when
and
where
did
you
meet
her
chapter
eleven
you
are
damned
impertinent
sir
judge
marshall
shouted
the
ends
of
his
waxed
grey
mustache
trembling
with
anger
then
i
take
it
that
you
do
not
wish
to
divulge
the
circumstances
of
your
friendship
with
mrs
selim
dundee
asked
friendship
the
old
man
snorted
your
implications
sir
are
dastardly
i
met
selim
or
rather
nita
leigh
as
she
was
introduced
to
me
only
once
several
years
ago
when
i
was
in
new
york
naturally
just
a
moment
judge
you
say
she
was
introduced
to
you
as
nita
leigh
then
you
knew
her
as
an
actress
i
presume
i
refuse
to
submit
to
such
a
cowardly
attack
sir
judge
dundee
repeated
with
assumed
astonishment
i
merely
thought
you
might
be
able
to
shed
a
little
light
on
the
past
of
the
woman
who
has
been
murdered
here
today
with
a
weapon
you
admit
to
having
owned
however
the
elderly
stared
at
his
tormentor
for
a
moment
as
if
murder
was
in
his
heart
he
gasped
twice
then
suddenly
his
whole
manner
changed
i
apologize
dundee
you
must
realize
how
but
that
is
beside
the
point
i
met
nita
leigh
at
er
at
a
social
gathering
arranged
by
some
new
york
friends
of
mine
she
was
young
attractive
more
refined
than
er
than
the
average
young
woman
in
musical
comedy
naturally
i
told
her
if
she
was
ever
in
hamilton
to
look
me
up
and
she
did
and
because
she
was
refined
than
the
average
young
woman
in
musical
comedy
than
the
average
chorus
girl
to
put
it
simply
dundee
took
him
up
you
with
dunlap
to
introduce
her
to
your
most
intimate
friends
including
your
wife
oh
hugo
why
did
you
tell
me
karen
marshall
wailed
you
see
sir
what
you
are
doing
judge
marshall
stormed
i
am
truly
sorry
if
i
have
distressed
you
marshall
dundee
protested
sincerely
but
he
shrugged
and
turned
again
to
the
husband
i
understand
you
were
selim
landlord
may
i
ask
how
much
rent
she
paid
the
house
rents
for
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
furnished
and
did
selim
pay
her
rent
promptly
dundee
persisted
since
this
is
the
of
may
sir
selim
rent
for
june
was
not
yet
due
not
before
poor
little
karen
could
dundee
force
himself
to
ask
what
inevitably
would
have
been
his
next
question
one
which
could
not
have
been
evaded
as
the
had
evaded
the
other
two
questions
it
not
true
judge
marshal
that
nita
leigh
selim
paid
you
no
rent
at
all
but
there
were
other
ways
to
find
out
look
here
dundee
a
brusque
voice
challenged
and
the
detective
whirled
to
face
polly
beale
it
was
like
her
he
thought
with
a
slight
grin
to
address
him
as
one
man
to
another
yes
miss
beale
i
no
fool
and
i
do
think
any
of
my
friends
here
are
either
though
two
or
three
of
them
have
acted
like
it
today
the
girl
stated
flatly
you
made
it
very
plain
that
any
one
of
us
here
except
the
sprague
man
could
have
stolen
hugo
gun
and
silencer
has
the
gun
been
found
it
has
not
miss
beale
o
the
queer
girl
snapped
her
fingers
i
move
that
you
or
captain
strawn
search
the
men
for
the
weapon
and
that
i
search
the
women
wait
she
harshly
stopped
a
flurry
of
feminine
protests
ask
you
dundee
to
search
me
first
yourself
i
believe
the
technical
term
is
is
it
then
me
here
is
my
handbag
i
wore
no
coat
except
this
and
she
pointed
to
the
jacket
of
her
tweed
suit
as
she
strode
toward
the
detective
clive
hammond
sprang
after
her
with
an
oath
and
a
sharp
command
shut
up
clive
i
not
married
to
you
yet
she
retorted
but
her
eyes
were
gentler
than
her
voice
his
face
burning
with
embarrassment
dundee
went
through
the
traditional
gestures
of
police
frisking
running
his
hands
rapidly
down
the
tall
sturdy
body
slapping
her
pockets
and
his
fingers
fumbled
sadly
as
he
opened
her
tooled
leather
handbag
satisfied
polly
beale
demanded
and
at
dundee
miserable
nod
the
girl
faced
her
friends
well
come
along
girls
lord
what
a
girl
dundee
muttered
to
strawn
as
the
young
amazon
herded
flora
miles
penny
crain
karen
marshall
carolyn
drake
lois
dunlap
and
janet
raymond
into
the
dining
room
silently
and
almost
meekly
as
if
shamed
into
submission
by
polly
beale
example
john
drake
tracey
miles
clive
hammond
judge
marshall
and
dexter
sprague
permitted
captain
strawn
and
sergeant
turner
to
search
them
how
about
the
guest
closet
and
the
cars
dundee
asked
of
strawn
in
a
low
voice
when
the
fruitless
unpleasant
task
was
finished
gone
over
with
a
fine
tooth
comb
long
ago
strawn
assured
him
gloomily
and
not
a
hiding
place
in
or
outside
the
house
that
the
boys
have
poked
into
including
the
meadow
as
far
as
anyone
could
throw
from
the
bedroom
window
the
women
were
filing
back
into
the
room
some
pale
some
flushed
but
all
able
to
look
each
other
in
the
eye
again
with
surprising
jauntiness
polly
beale
saluted
dundee
nothing
more
deadly
on
any
of
us
than

all
my
heart
miss
beale
dundee
said
sincerely
and
now
i
think
you
may
all
go
to
your
homes
of
course
you
understand
he
interrupted
a
chorus
of
relieved
ejaculations
that
all
of
you
will
be
wanted
for
the
inquest
which
will
probably
be
held
monday
and
what
more
captain
strawn
cut
in
to
show
his
authority
i
want
all
of
you
to
hold
yourselves
ready
for
further
questioning
at
any
time
there
was
a
stampede
for
coats
and
hats
a
rush
for
cars
as
if
the
house
were
on
fire
or
dundee
reflected
wryly
as
if
those
he
had
tortured
were
afraid
he
would
change
his
mind
rushing
away
with
hatred
of
him
in
their
hearts
only
penny
crain
held
back
maneuvering
for
a
chance
to
speak
with
him
i
do
have
to
go
with
the
rest
do
i
she
begged
in
a
husky
whisper
and
why
not
dundee
grinned
at
her
but
he
was
glad
there
was
no
hatred
in
eyes
i
to
the
district
attorney
office

i

penny
i
want
to

i
like
to
have
a
long
talk
with
you
tomorrow
come
to
sunday
dinner
mother

she
suggested
then
realization
swept
over
her
her
brown
eyes
widened
filled
with
terror
stop
thinking
one
of
us
did
it
i
tell
you
can
stop
penny
he
asked
gently
but
she
fled
from
him
sobbing
wildly
for
the
first
time
that
long
horrible
evening
dundee
watching
from
the
doorway
of
the
lighted
hall
saw
the
chauffeur
open
the
rear
door
of
the
dunlap
limousine
saw
penny
catapult
herself
into
lois
dunlap
outstretched
arms
when
did
the
dunlap
chauffeur
call
for
his
mistress
he
asked
strawn
who
stood
beside
him
about
ten
minutes
after
you
arrived
strawn
answered
wearily
said
he
dropped
dunlap
and
the
selim
woman
at
about
and
had
been
ordered
to
return
around
knows
nothing
of
course
the
chief
of
the
homicide
squad
drew
a
deep
breath
well
bonnie
he
has
nothing
on
me
in
spite
of
all
the
palaver
i
do
know
nothing
either
you
need
some
dinner
chief
dundee
suggested
and
the
boys
must
be
getting
hungry
too
somebody
got
to
guard
the
house
i
suppose
strawn
gloomed
not
that
it
will
do
any
good
and
what
about
that
maid
that
carr
woman
shall
i
lock
her
up
on
general
principles
no
i
want
to
have
another
talk
with
her
and
if
she
bucks
at
spending
the
night
here
i
take
her
to
the
rhodes
house
and
turn
her
over
to
my
old
friend
mother
rhodes
we
have
anything
on
her
you
know
no
nor
on
anybody
else
except
that
old
fool
marshall
and
we
clap
him
into
jail
yet
strawn
agreed
his
grey
eyes
twinkling
take
your
crew
on
in
chief
dundee
urged
i
stick
till
midnight
or
longer
if
you
do
mind
you
can
arrange
to
have
a
couple
of
the
boys
to
relieve
me
about
twelve
and
by
the
way
will
you
telephone
me
the
minute
you
get
hold
of
ralph
hammond
well
maybe
not
so
quick
as
all
that
strawn
drawled
i
take
the
first
crack
at
baby
my
lad
not
so
dumb
am
i
not
so
dumb
i
can
put
two
and
two
together
as
well
as
the
next
one
pretty
near
as
well
as
the
district
attorney
new
investigator
although
bonnie
dundee
had
taken
captain
strawn
parting
gibe
with
good
grace
it
was
a
very
thoughtful
young
detective
who
set
about
locking
himself
into
the
house
in
which
nita
selim
had
been
murdered
captain
strawn
had
beaten
him
to
the
job
that
evening
by
at
least
twenty
minutes
had
the
old
detective
stumbled
upon
something
which
dundee
for
all
his
spectacular
thoroughness
had
overlooked
or
had
been
unable
to
turn
up
because
strawn
had
suppressed
it
what
if
strawn
parting
boast
was
not
an
idle
one
and
he
really
had
the
goods
on
ralph
hammond
had
the
old
chief
been
laughing
up
his
sleeve
during
the
farce
of
playing
out
the
death
hand
at
bridge
and
during
the
merciless
quizzing
of
old
judge
marshall
but
dundee
native
common
sense
quickly
routed
his
gloom
captain
strawn
was
too
direct
in
his
methods
too
afraid
of
antagonizing
the
rich
and
influential
to
have
permitted
even
a
special
investigator
from
the
district
attorney
office
to
torment
those
twelve
people
needlessly
probably
strawn
feeling
a
little
hurt
at
having
played
second
fiddle
all
evening
had
simply
wanted
to
get
him
fussed
was
even
now
chuckling
over
the
effect
of
his
parting
boast
much
cheered
dundee
lingered
in
the
dining
room
whose
windows
he
had
made
fast
against
any
intrusion
so
that
his
task
of
guarding
the
house
alone
might
be
minimized
as
he
glanced
at
the
table
with
its
silver
plates
heaped
with
tiny
sandwiches
of
caviar
and
anchovy
paste
its
little
silver
boats
of
olives
and
sweet
pickles
he
discovered
that
he
was
very
hungry
indeed
as
he
munched
the
drying
sandwiches
and
sipped
charged
water
the
various
liquors
for
cocktails
on
the
sideboard
offered
a
temptation
which
he
sternly
resisted
dundee
thought
boiled
and
churned
throwing
up
picture
after
picture
of
nita
selim
alive
and
then
dead
of
penny
crain
bless
her
helping
him
at
the
expense
of
her
loyalty
to
friends
of
flora
miles
lying
desperately
and
then
confessing
to
a
shameful
theft
of
karen
marshall
gallantly
playing
out
the
death
hand
of
karen
stricken
childish
face
when
she
learned
that
her
elderly
husband
had
met
and
at
least
flirted
with
nita
selim
at
a
chorus
girls
party
at
that
last
picture
dundee
flushed
so
that
his
skin
prickled
had
he
made
a
fool
of
himself
or
was
he
right
in
his
suspicion
that
hugo
marshall
had
given
nita
selim
this
cottage
rent
free
that
point
should
be
easily
settled
at
any
rate
ruefully
reflecting
that
appetizers
do
not
make
a
satisfactory
meal
he
betook
himself
to
the
dead
woman
bedroom
yes
his
memory
had
served
him
well
here
was
her
desk
a
small
feminine
affair
of
rosewood
set
in
the
corner
of
the
room
nearest
the
porch
door
the
desk
was
not
locked
as
dundee
let
down
the
slanting
lid
whose
polish
was
marred
with
many
fingerprints
he
saw
that
its
contents
were
in
a
hopeless
jumble
so
strawn
had
beaten
him
to
this
too
had
he
found
an
clue
in
one
of
the
many
little
and
drawers
stuffing
it
into
his
pocket
just
before
a
bumptious
young
special
investigator
had
arrived
but
dundee
returning
gloom
was
instantly
dispelled
here
was
checkbook
a
flutter
of
stubs
attached
to
only
one
remaining
blank
check
so
nita
had
banked
with
the
hamilton
national
bank
of
which
john
drake
who
apparently
hated
his
fattish
fussy
wife
was
a
vice
president
another
tiny
fact
to
be
tucked
away
she
had
opened
her
account
apparently
on
april
the
day
of
her
arrival
in
hamilton
the
guest
and
employe
of
peter
dunlap
probably
lois
dunlap
had
advanced
her
the
two
hundred
dollars
as
first
payment
for
her
prospective
work
in
organizing
a
little
theater
movement
in
hamilton
turning
rapidly
through
stubs
dundee
stopped
twice
whistling
softly
with
amazement
each
time
for
on
april
and
again
on
may
nita
selim
had
deposited
where
had
she
got
the
money
were
the
sums
transfers
from
accounts
in
new
york
banks
but
it
was
hardly
likely
that
a
little
broadway
had
had
so
much
hard
cash
on
deposit
then
where
had
she
got
it
at
a
time
here
in
hamilton
hastily
but
thoroughly
dundee
ran
through
the
remaining
check
stubs
record
at
all
of
a
check
for
rent
made
out
to
judge
hugo
marshall
but
there
was
a
stub
that
interested
him
check
no
nita
had
spent
her
money
lavishly
was
filled
in
as
follows
in
nita
pretty
backhand
no
to
for
had
john
drake
who
as
vice
president
in
charge
of
trusts
and
investments
had
doubtless
handled
the
check
wondered
at
all
where
the
had
come
from
one
other
revelation
came
out
of
the
stubs
on
every
monday
nita
selim
had
drawn
a
check
for
to
her
maid
lydia
carr
again
dundee
whistled
forty
dollars
a
week
was
he
wagered
to
himself
more
money
than
any
other
maid
in
hamilton
was
lucky
enough
to
receive
nita
in
a
new
light
an
nita
or
nita
herself
paying
blackmail
on
a
small
he
reached
into
a
whose
contents
a
thick
packet
of
unused
envelopes
had
not
been
disturbed
by
strawn
and
was
about
to
remove
an
envelope
in
which
to
place
the
checkbook
when
he
noticed
something
slightly
peculiar
an
envelope
in
the
middle
of
the
packet
looked
rather
thicker
than
an
empty
case
should
it
was
not
and
across
the
face
of
the
expensive
linen
paper
was
written
in
that
same
pretty
very
legible
backhand
to
be
opened
in
case
of
my
death
jaunita
leigh
selim
his
heart
hammering
painfully
and
his
fingers
trembling
dundee
drew
out
the
two
sheets
of
creamy
notepaper
after
all
who
had
better
right
than
he
to
open
it
was
he
not
the
representative
of
the
district
attorney
and
he
had
damaged
the
envelope
it
had
opened
very
easily
indeed
its
flap
had
yielded
instantly
to
his
wait
it
had
been
before
unfolding
the
letter
or
whatever
it
was
dundee
examined
the
flap
of
the
envelope
yes
he
was
not
the
first
to
open
it
since
its
original
sealing
god
grant
he
destroyed
any
fingerprints
in
his
criminal
haste
to
learn
any
secret
that
nita
selim
had
recorded
here
perhaps
nita
herself
had
unsealed
the
letter
to
make
an
addition
or
a
correction
well
whatever
damage
had
been
done
was
done
now
and
he
might
as
well
read
five
minutes
later
bonnie
dundee
was
racing
through
the
dining
room
pushing
open
the
swinging
door
that
led
into
the
butler
pantry
where
the
devil
were
the
steps
that
led
down
into
the
basement
a
precious
minute
was
lost
before
he
discovered
that
a
door
in
the
dark
back
hall
opened
upon
the
steep
stairs
an
unshaded
light
dangling
from
the
ceiling
revealed
the
furnace
in
one
corner
of
the
big
basement
laundry
equipment
in
another
he
plunged
on
that
must
be
the
maid
room
behind
that
closed
door
god
what
if
she
had
escaped
while
he
had
been
munching
caviar
and
anchovy
sandwiches
a
fine
guard
he
been
and
it
was
as
if
he
had
had
a
dim
suspicion
of
the
truth
the
knob
turned
easily
he
flung
open
the
door
and
then
his
knees
nearly
gave
way
so
tremendous
was
his
relief
for
there
on
the
thin
mattress
of
a
iron
bed
lay
the
woman
he
so
ardently
desired
to
see
she
had
apparently
been
asleep
and
the
noise
he
had
made
had
startled
her
into
panicky
wakefulness
instinctively
her
hand
flew
to
the
ruined
left
side
of
her
face
that
hideous
expanse
of
livid
flesh
scarred
and
ridged
so
that
it
did
not
look
human
what
who
lydia
carr
gasped
struggling
to
a
sitting
position
only
to
fall
back
as
nausea
swept
over
her
you
remember
me
dundee
panted
dundee
of
the
district
office
i
questioned
you
this
afternoon
the
woman
closed
the
single
eye
that
had
escaped
the
accident
which
had
marred
her
face
so
hideously
i
remember
i
sick
i
told
you
all
i
know
lydia
why
did
you
tell
me
that
it
was
your
mistress
selim
who
did
that
dundee
demanded
sternly
pointing
to
the
woman
sightless
left
eye
and
ruined
cheek
chapter
twelve
lydia
carr
still
clothed
in
the
black
cotton
dress
and
white
apron
of
her
maid
uniform
struggled
to
a
sitting
position
on
the
edge
of
her
basement
room
bed
no
no
that
a
lie
it
was
an
accident
i
tell
you
my
own
fault
who
dared
to
say
nita
miss
nita
did
it
better
lie
down
lydia
dundee
suggested
gently
i
wo
want
you
fainting
you
had
a
hard
day
with
the
abscessed
tooth
the
dope
the
dentist
gave
you
and
other
things
i
do
wonder
that
you
lost
your
head
went
a
little
crazy
perhaps
the
detective
sinister
implication
seemed
to
make
no
impression
at
all
upon
the
woman
with
the
scarred
face
i
asked
you
she
gasped
her
single
eye
glaring
at
him
who
dared
say
nita
burned
me
it
was
nita
herself
who
told
me
dundee
answered
softly
just
a
few
minutes
ago
holy
mother
the
maid
gasped
and
crossed
herself
dazedly
let
her
think
the
dead
woman
had
appeared
to
him
in
a
vision
dundee
told
himself
perhaps
her
confession
would
come
the
quicker
the
maid
began
to
rock
her
gaunt
body
her
arms
crossed
over
her
flat
chest
my
poor
little
girl
even
in
death
she
thinks
of
me
sorry
she
sent
me
a
message
did
she
tell
me
she
was
always
trying
to
comfort
me
sir
the
poor
little
thing
could
believe
forgiven
her
as
soon
as
she
done
it
tell
me
yes
dundee
agreed
his
eyes
watching
her
keenly
she
sent
you
a
message
of
a
sort
but
i
ca
give
it
to
you
until
you
have
told
me
all
about
the
accident
in
which
you
were
burned
i
tell
lydia
promised
eagerly
gone
were
the
harshness
and
secretiveness
with
which
she
had
met
his
earlier
questioning
you
see
sir
i
loved
miss
nita
i
called
her
nita
if
you
do
mind
sir
i
loved
her
like
she
was
my
own
child
and
she
was
fond
of
me
too
fonder
of
me
than
of
anybody
in
the
world
she
used
to
tell
me
when
some
man
had
hurt
her
bad
and
there
was
always
some
man
or
other
she
was
so
sweet
and
so
pretty
well
i
found
her
in
the
bathroom
one
day
just
ready
to
drink
carbolic
acid
to
kill
her
poor
little
self
when
was
that
lydia
dundee
interrupted
it
was
in
february
sunday
the
ninth
of
february
lydia
went
on
still
rocking
in
an
agony
of
grief
i
tried
to
take
the
glass
out
of
her
hands
she
poured
a
lot
of
the
stuff
out
of
the
bottle
you
see
she
was
already
in
a
fit
of
hysterics
or
she
never
have
tried
to
kill
herself
it
was
my
own
fault
trying
to
take
the
glass
away
from
her
like
i
did
she
flung
the
acid
into
your
face
dundee
asked
shuddering
she
did
know
what
she
was
doing
the
woman
cried
glaring
at
him
nearly
went
out
of
her
mind
they
told
me
at
the
hospital
because
she
hurt
me
a
private
room
in
the
best
hospital
in
new
york
she
got
for
me
trained
nurses
night
and
day
and
so
many
doctors
fussing
around
me
i
wanted
to
fire
the
whole
outfit
and
save
some
of
my
poor
girl
money
which
i
do
know
till
this
day
how
she
got
hold
of
dundee
let
her
sob
and
rock
her
arms
for
a
while
unmolested
in
february
nita
selim
had
had
to
borrow
money
to
pay
doctor
and
hospital
bills
had
borrowed
it
or
it
and
in
may
she
had
been
rich
enough
to
have
to
invest
lydia
you
never
forgave
nita
selim
for
ruining
your
life
as
well
as
your
face
dundee
charged
her
suddenly
you
a
liar
she
cried
passionately
i
know
what
i
felt
it
face
and
life
ai
it
i
tell
you
i
did
even
bear
a
grudge
against
her
the
poor
little
thing
eating
her
heart
out
with
sorrow
for
what
she
done
till
the
very
day
of
her
death
always
trying
to
make
it
up
to
me
paying
me
too
much
money
for
the
handful
of
work
i
had
to
do
what
with
her
eating
out
nearly
all
the
time
and
throwing
away
stockings
the
minute
they
got
a
run
in
forgive
her
i
have
crawled
from
here
to
new
york
on
my
hands
and
knees
for
nita
leigh
dundee
studied
her
horribly
scarred
face
made
more
horrible
now
by
what
looked
like
genuine
grief
lydia
who
was
the
man
over
whom
your
mistress
wanted
to
commit
suicide
the
single
eye
glared
at
him
suspiciously
then
became
wary
i
do
know
was
it
dexter
sprague
lydia
sprague
she
spat
the
name
out
contemptuously
no
she
did
know
him
then
except
to
speak
to
at
the
moving
picture
studio
when
did
he
become
her
lover
lydia
dundee
asked
casually
the
woman
stiffened
became
menacingly
hostile
who
says
he
was
her
lover
you
ca
trick
me
detective
i
cut
my
tongue
out
before
i
let
you
make
me
say
one
word
against
my
poor
girl
dundee
shrugged
he
knew
a
stone
wall
when
he
ran
up
against
one
lydia
he
began
again
after
a
thoughtful
pause
i
have
proof
that
nita
selim
was
sure
you
had
never
forgiven
her
for
the
injury
she
did
you
his
fingers
touched
the
letter
in
his
pocket
that
incredible
last
will
and
testament
which
nita
had
written
the
day
before
she
was
murdered
and
that
another
lie
the
woman
cried
shaking
with
anger
she
struggled
to
her
feet
stood
swaying
dizzily
a
moment
come
upstairs
with
me
to
her
room
and
i
show
some
proof
that
i
had
forgiven
her
come
along
i
tell
you
trying
to
make
me
say
killed
my
poor
girl
when
i
have
died
for
her
come
on
i
tell
you
and
dundee
wondering
beginning
to
doubt
his
own
conviction
a
little
that
conviction
which
had
sprung
out
of
strange
informal
will
and
which
had
seemed
to
explain
everything
followed
lydia
carr
from
her
basement
room
to
the
bedroom
in
which
nita
had
been
murdered
see
this
and
lydia
carr
snatched
up
the
powder
box
from
the
her
long
bony
fingers
busied
themselves
with
frantic
haste
and
suddenly
into
the
silence
of
the
room
came
the
tinkle
of
music
bought
her
this
for
a
present
out
of
my
own
money
soon
as
i
got
out
of
the
hospital
the
maid
voice
shrilled
over
the
slow
sweet
tinkly
notes
it
playing
her
name
song
it
was
playing
that
song
when
she
died
i
stood
there
in
the
doorway
and
heard
it
and
she
pointed
toward
the
door
leading
from
nita
room
into
the
back
hall
she
loved
it
and
used
it
all
the
time
because
i
gave
it
to
her
and
she
set
the
musical
powder
box
upon
the
and
rushed
across
the
room
to
one
of
the
several
lamps
that
dundee
had
noticed
on
his
first
survey
of
the
room
it
was
the
largest
and
gaudiest
of
the
collection
a
huge
bowl
of
filigreed
bronze
set
with
innumerable
stones
as
large
as
marbles
or
larger
red
yellow
and
green
stones
that
must
have
cast
a
strange
radiance
over
the
pretty
head
that
had
been
wont
to
lie
just
beneath
it
on
the
heaped
lace
pillows
of
the
chaise
lounge
dundee
reflected
as
if
lydia
had
read
his
thoughts
she
jerked
at
the
little
chain
which
hung
from
the
bottom
of
the
big
bronze
bowl
against
the
heavy
metal
standard
i
gave
her
this
saved
up
for
it
out
of
my
own
money
she
was
assuring
him
with
savage
triumph
in
proving
her
point
and
she
loved
it
so
she
brought
it
with
us
when
we
came
from
new
york
it
wo
light
it
was
working
all
right
last
night
because
my
poor
little
girl
was
lying
there
looking
so
pretty
under
the
colored
lights
with
strong
twists
of
her
big
hands
lydia
began
to
unscrew
the
filigreed
bronze
bowl
as
she
lifted
it
off
she
exclaimed
blankly
why
look
the
light
bulb
but
dundee
had
already
seen
not
only
the
broken
light
bulb
but
the
explanation
of
the
queer
noise
that
flora
miles
had
described
hysterically
over
and
over
as
a
bang
or
a
bump
the
chaise
lounge
stood
between
the
two
windows
that
opened
upon
the
drive
and
at
the
head
of
it
stood
the
big
lamp
just
a
few
inches
from
the
wall
and
only
a
foot
from
the
window
frame
upon
which
price
had
pencilled
the
point
to
indicate
the
end
of
the
imaginary
line
along
which
the
shot
which
killed
nita
leigh
selim
had
traveled
the
bang
or
bump
which
flora
miles
had
heard
had
been
made
by
the
knocking
of
the
big
lamp
against
the
wall
undoubtedly
the
one
who
had
bumped
into
the
lamp
was
nita
murderer
or
murderess
in
frantic
haste
to
make
an
escape
that
meant
that
the
murderer
had
fled
toward
the
back
hall
not
through
the
window
in
front
of
which
he
had
stood
not
through
the
door
leading
onto
the
front
porch
a
little
progress
at
least
but
lydia
was
not
through
proving
that
she
had
forgiven
her
mistress
she
was
snatching
things
from
nita
clothes
closet
see
these
mules
with
ostrich
feathers
i
give
to
my
girl
and
this
bed
jacket
i
embroidered
the
flowers
on
it
with
my
own
hands
through
her
flood
of
proof
dundee
heard
the
whir
of
a
car
engine
then
the
loud
banging
of
a
car
door
running
footsteps
on
the
flagstone
path
dundee
reached
the
front
door
just
as
the
bell
pealed
shrilly
hello
dundee
awfully
glad
i
caught
you
before
you
left
is
poor
lydia
still
here
come
in
mr
miles
dundee
invited
searching
with
a
puzzled
frown
the
round
blond
face
of
tracey
miles
yes
lydia
is
still
here
why
then
i
in
luck
and
i
think
lydia
is
too
poor
old
girl
you
see
dundee
miles
began
to
explain
as
he
took
off
his
new
straw
hat
to
mop
his
perspiring
forehead
the
crowd
all
ganged
up
when
our
various
cars
reached
sheridan
road
and
by
unanimous
vote
we
elected
to
drive
over
to
the
country
club
for
a
meal
in
one
of
the
small
private
dining
rooms
to
escape
the
questions
of
the
morbidly
curious
you
know
yes
what
about
it
dundee
interrupted
impatiently
well
i
admit
we
were
all
pretty
hungry
in
spite
of
well
of
course
we
were
all
fond
of
nita
but
what
about
lydia
dundee
cut
him
short
i
getting
to
it
old
boy
miles
protested
with
the
injured
air
of
an
unappreciated
small
boy
while
we
were
waiting
for
our
food
somebody
said
lydia
what
going
to
become
of
and
somebody
else
said
that
it
was
harder
on
her
nita
death
i
mean
than
on
anybody
else
because
nita
was
all
she
had
in
the
world
and
then
lois
lois
is
always
practical
you
know
ran
to
telephone
police
headquarters
to
see
what
had
been
done
with
lydia
and
to
see
if
it
would
be
all
right
for
flora
and
me
to
take
her
home
with
us
just
a
minute
miles
whom
did
dunlap
talk
to
at
headquarters
why
captain
strawn
of
course
miles
answered
he
told
lois
that
you
were
still
out
here
questioning
lydia
again
and
that
it
was
all
right
with
him
whatever
you
decided
so
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
eating
i
drove
over
is
mrs
miles
with
you
dundee
interrupted
again
well
no
miles
admitted
uncomfortably
you
see
the
girls
felt
a
little
squeamish
about
coming
back
even
on
an
errand
of
mercy
dundee
grinned
he
had
no
doubt
that
flora
miles
had
emphatically
refused
the
possibility
of
another
gruelling
interview
why
do
you
and
mrs
miles
want
to
take
lydia
home
with
you
he
asked
to
give
her
a
home
and
a
job
miles
answered
promptly
she
knows
us
we
used
to
her
poor
old
scarred
face
and
the
youngsters
tam
and
betty
are
not
a
bit
afraid
of
her
in
fact
betty
pats
that
scarred
cheek
and
says
over
and
over
lyddy
poo
lyddy
betty
lyddy
and
tam
he
a
miles
junior
you
know
and
we
call
him
tam
from
the
initials
because
he
hates
being
called
junior
and
two
tracey
are
a
nuisance
i
gather
that
you
want
to
hire
lydia
as
a
nurse
for
the
children
dundee
interrupted
the
fond
father
verbose
explanations
right
old
man
you
see
our
nurse
left
us
yesterday
wait
here
miles
i
speak
to
lydia
she
in
bedroom
by
the
way
miles
since
you
and
your
wife
are
kind
enough
to
want
to
take
lydia
in
and
give
her
a
home
and
a
job
i
think
it
only
fair
to
tell
you
that
it
is
highly
improbable
that
lydia
carr
will
take
any
job
at
all
you
mean
miles
gasped
his
ruddy
face
turning
pale
i
say
dundee
it
absurd
to
think
for
a
minute
that
good
old
faithful
lydia
had
a
thing
to
do
with
nita
murder
i
rather
think
you
right
about
that
miles
dundee
interrupted
now
will
you
excuse
me
he
found
lydia
where
he
had
left
her
in
her
dead
mistress
bedroom
the
tall
gaunt
woman
was
crouching
beside
the
chaise
longue
her
arms
outstretched
to
encircle
a
little
pile
of
the
gifts
she
claimed
to
have
given
nita
selim
to
prove
that
she
bore
no
grudge
for
the
terrible
injury
her
mistress
had
done
her
at
dundee
entrance
she
flung
up
her
head
and
the
detective
saw
that
tears
were
streaming
from
both
the
sightless
eye
and
the
unharmed
one
taking
his
seat
on
the
chaise
longue
dundee
explained
gently
but
briefly
the
offer
which
tracey
miles
had
just
made
they
want
she
gasped
brokenly
incredulously
and
her
fingers
faltered
to
her
horrible
cheek
i
did
think
anybody
but
my
poor
girl
would
have
me
around
it
is
true
they
want
you
dundee
assured
her
but
you
do
have
to
take
a
job
now
unless
you
wish
lydia
what
do
you
mean
the
maid
demanded
harshly
her
good
eye
hardening
with
suspicion
lydia
the
young
detective
began
slowly
and
almost
praying
that
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
when
i
woke
you
up
tonight
to
question
you
i
said
that
nita
herself
had
just
told
me
that
it
was
she
who
had
burned
your
face
and
you
asked
me
if
she
had
also
given
you
a
message
yes
sir
the
maid
interrupted
with
pitiful
eagerness
and
tell
me
now
you
do
still
think
killed
her
do
you
no
i
do
think
you
killed
your
mistress
lydia
but
i
think
if
you
would
you
could
help
me
find
out
who
did
dundee
assured
her
gravely
no
wait
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
envelope
inscribed
to
be
opened
in
case
of
my
death
juanita
leigh
selim
do
you
recognize
this
handwriting
lydia
it
was
wrote
by
her
own
hand
the
maid
answered
her
voice
husky
with
tears
is
that
the
message
sir
you
never
saw
it
before
dundee
asked
sharply
no
no
i
did
know
my
poor
girl
was
thinking
about
death
lydia
moaned
i
thought
she
was
happy
here
she
was
tickled
to
pieces
over
being
taken
up
by
all
them
society
people
and
on
the
go
day
and
night
lydia
this
is
selim
last
will
and
testament
dundee
interrupted
withdrawing
the
sheets
slowly
and
unfolding
them
it
was
written
yesterday
and
it
begins
that
any
of
us
may
die
any
time
and
that
i
juanita
leigh
selim
have
good
cause
to
fear
that
my
own
life
hangs
by
a
thread
that
may
break
any
minute
what
did
my
poor
girl
mean
lydia
carr
cried
out
vehemently
she
was
sick
ever
i
think
lydia
that
she
feared
exactly
what
happened
today
murder
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
who
it
was
she
feared
i
believe
you
know
the
woman
shrank
from
him
until
she
was
sitting
on
her
lean
haunches
her
hands
flattening
against
her
cheeks
for
a
long
minute
she
did
not
attempt
to
answer
her
right
eye
widened
enormously
then
slowly
grew
as
expressionless
as
the
milky
left
ball
i
do
know
she
said
dully
then
with
vehement
emphasis
do
know
if
i
did
i
kill
him
with
my
own
hands
dundee
had
no
choice
but
to
take
her
word
you
said
there
was
a
message
for
me
lydia
reminded
him
i
read
you
her
will
first
dundee
said
quietly
lifting
the
sheets
again
i
am
herewith
setting
down
my
last
will
and
testament
in
my
own
handwriting
i
do
here
and
now
solemnly
will
and
bequeath
to
my
faithful
and
beloved
maid
lydia
carr
all
property
including
all
moneys
stocks
and
personal
belongings
of
which
i
die
possessed
to
lydia
whispered
to
me
to
you
lydia
dundee
assured
her
gravely
then
i
can
have
all
her
pretty
clothes
to
keep
always
and
her
money
to
do
as
you
like
with
if
the
court
accepts
this
will
for
probate
as
i
think
it
will
regardless
of
the
fact
that
it
is
very
informal
and
was
not
witnessed
but
she
did
have
any
money
lydia
protested
nothing
but
what
dunlap
paid
her
in
advance
for
the
work
she
was
going
to
do
lydia
your
mistress
died
possessed
of
nearly
ten
thousand
dollars
dundee
fixed
her
bewildered
grey
eye
with
his
blue
ones
thousand
dollars
all
of
which
she
got
right
here
in
hamilton
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
how
she
got
it
but
i
do
know
i
do
believe
she
had
it
dundee
shrugged
either
this
woman
would
perjure
her
soul
to
protect
her
mistress
name
from
scandal
or
she
really
knew
nothing
that
is
all
of
the
will
itself
lydia
he
went
on
finally
except
her
command
that
her
body
be
cremated
without
funeral
services
of
any
kind
and
that
nobody
be
allowed
to
accompany
the
remains
to
the
crematory
except
yourself
and
peter
dunlap
in
case
her
death
takes
place
in
hamilton
she
love
dunlap
lydia
sobbed
oh
my
poor
little
girl
and
there
is
also
a
note
for
you
which
i
took
the
liberty
of
reading
in
which
selim
minutely
describes
the
clothes
in
which
she
wishes
to
be
cremated
as
well
as
the
fashion
in
which
her
hair
is
to
be
dressed
let
me
see
it
lydia
plunged
forward
on
her
knees
and
snatched
at
the
papers
he
held
for
god
sake
let
me
see
chapter
thirteen
i
read
you
the
note
lydia
but
i
ca
let
you
touch
it
dundee
said
sternly
taking
good
care
that
she
should
not
touch
either
the
paper
on
which
the
note
to
herself
had
been
written
or
the
sheet
which
contained
that
strange
informal
will
informal
in
spite
of
the
dead
woman
obvious
effort
to
couch
it
in
legal
phraseology
was
lydia
frenzy
assumed
did
she
hope
to
leave
fingerprints
now
which
would
account
for
fingerprints
she
had
already
left
upon
it
was
it
not
possible
that
lydia
had
been
the
prying
fingers
which
had
opened
the
envelope
after
nita
selim
had
sealed
it
with
god
only
knew
what
fears
in
her
heart
if
so
lydia
carr
had
found
that
she
was
her
mistress
sole
legatee
coupled
with
greed
what
better
motive
for
murder
could
a
detective
ask
and
who
had
had
so
good
an
opportunity
as
lydia
carr
to
dispose
of
the
weapon
the
woman
crouched
back
on
her
haunches
an
agony
of
pleading
in
her
single
eye
lydia
i
think
you
know
already
what
this
note
tells
you
dundee
said
slowly
to
his
astonishment
the
maid
nodded
the
tears
starting
again
i
asked
her
once
what
she
wanted
to
keep
that
old
dress
for
and
she
she
said
i
find
out
some
day
but
i
never
dreamed
she
want
it
for
a
oh
my
god
for
a
for
the
second
time
that
evening
lydia
carr
completely
routed
carefully
case
against
her
it
was
inconceivable
he
told
himself
that
a
mind
cunning
enough
to
have
executed
this
murder
would
give
itself
away
in
such
a
fashion
if
she
had
indeed
pried
among
her
mistress
papers
and
found
the
will
and
note
would
she
not
from
the
most
primitive
instinct
of
have
pretended
total
ignorance
of
the
note
contents
i
read
the
note
lydia
he
said
gently
it
is
addressed
precious
old
lydia
she
was
always
calling
me
that
the
maid
sobbed
and
she
writes
you
ever
read
this
it
will
be
because
i
dead
and
you
know
that
i
tried
to
make
it
up
to
you
the
only
way
i
knew
i
never
could
believe
you
really
forgave
me
but
maybe
you
will
now
and
there
is
one
last
thing
i
want
you
to
do
for
me
lydia
darling
you
remember
that
old
royal
blue
velvet
dress
of
mine
that
you
were
always
sniffing
at
and
either
trying
to
make
me
give
away
or
have
made
over
and
remember
that
i
told
you
that
you
know
some
time
why
i
kept
it
well
i
want
you
to
lay
me
out
in
it
lydia
such
a
funny
shroud
is
it
but
with
dresses
long
again
maybe
it
wo
look
so
funny
and
there
be
nobody
but
you
and
lois
to
see
me
in
it
because
i
said
so
in
my
will
and
i
want
my
hair
dressed
as
it
was
the
only
time
i
ever
wore
the
royal
blue
velvet
a
french
roll
lydia
with
little
curls
coming
out
the
left
side
of
it
and
hanging
down
to
the
left
ear
you
brush
the
hair
straight
up
the
back
of
the
head
gather
it
together
and
tie
a
little
bit
of
black
shoestring
around
it
then
you
twist
the
hair
into
a
roll
and
spread
it
high
pinning
it
down
on
each
side
of
the
head
do
forget
the
little
curls
on
the
left
side
i
hope
i
have
enough
hair
but
if
it
has
grown
long
enough
you
know
where
those
switches
are
that
i
had
made
when
i
first
bobbed
my
hair
you
wo
mind
touching
me
when
i
dead
will
you
lydia
i
do
love
you
nita
dundee
was
silent
for
a
minute
after
he
had
finished
reading
the
strange
note
and
had
returned
it
to
the
envelope
along
with
the
will
at
last
speaking
against
a
lump
in
his
throat
he
broke
in
on
the
desolate
sobbing
of
nita
maid
lydia
how
old
was
your
mistress
you
wo
put
it
in
the
papers
will
you
lydia
pleaded
she
she
was
but
not
a
soul
knew
it
except
me
and
will
you
tell
me
how
old
the
royal
blue
velvet
dress
is
he
continued
also
how
long
since
girls
dressed
their
hair
in
a
french
roll
the
dress
is
twelve
or
thirteen
years
old
lydia
said
her
voice
dull
now
with
grief
i
know
because
i
used
to
do
dressmaking
during
the
war
and
it
was
during
the
war
that
girls
wore
their
hair
that
way
i
did
mine
in
a
psyche
knot
but
the
french
roll
was
more
stylish
did
your
mistress
ever
tell
you
about
the
one
time
she
wore
the
dress
lydia
shook
her
head
no
she
would
talk
about
it
just
said
know
sometime
why
she
kept
it
royal
blue
velvet
it
is
the
skirt
halfway
to
the
ankles
and
sleeves
with
long
pointed
ends
lined
with
gold
taffeta
and
finished
off
with
gold
tassels
it
in
a
dress
bag
hanging
in
her
closet
do
you
think
it
was
her
wedding
dress
lydia
dundee
suggested
the
idea
suddenly
flashing
into
his
mind
i
do
know
i
did
ask
her
that
lydia
denied
dully
can
i
take
it
with
me
and
the
switches
she
had
made
out
of
her
curls
i
have
to
get
authority
to
remove
anything
from
the
house
lydia
dundee
told
her
but
i
am
sure
you
will
be
permitted
to
follow
selim
instructions
so
you
going
to
accept
the
miles
offer
of
a
job
as
nurse
yes
i
rather
work
and
mrs
miles
have
always
been
specially
nice
to
me
and
i
i
could
love
their
children
they
not
afraid
of
me
perhaps
you
wise
dundee
agreed
by
the
way
lydia
did
selim
have
a
pistol
in
her
possession
at
any
time
during
the
past
week
the
maid
shook
her
head
not
that
i
seen
and
if
she
got
one
because
she
was
afraid
she
it
handy
and
i
bound
to
see
it
convinced
of
her
sincerity
he
was
about
to
let
her
go
to
pack
her
bag
when
another
belated
question
occurred
to
him
lydia
will
you
tell
me
what
engagements
selim
had
this
last
week
the
woman
scowled
fanatically
jealous
dundee
guessed
of
her
reputation
but
at
last
she
answered
defiantly
let
me
see
sprague
had
sunday
dinner
here
and
spent
the
afternoon
but
sunday
night
it
was
young
ralph
hammond
he
come
whenever
she
let
him
monday
night
oh
yes
she
had
dinner
at
the
country
club
with
the
mileses
and
the
drakes
and
the
dunlaps
mr
miles
brought
her
home
because
sprague
was
invited
tuesday
night
let
me
think
yes
that
the
night
judge
marshall
was
here
nita
had
sent
for
him
to
talk
about
finishing
up
the
attic
so
that
was
the
business
engagement
which
judge
marshall
had
hemmed
and
hawed
over
dundee
reflected
and
wednesday
night
lydia
was
continuing
with
a
certain
pride
in
her
mistress
popularity
she
was
at
a
dinner
party
at
the
dunlaps
did
peter
dunlap
ever
call
on
mrs
selim
alone
lydia
was
curiously
resentful
he
was
ever
here
nita
said
to
me
she
wished
peter
liked
her
as
well
as
mis
lois
did
thursday
night
ralph
hammond
took
her
somewhere
to
dinner
to
some
other
town
i
think
but
i
was
awake
when
they
got
home
nita
never
would
let
me
set
up
for
her
said
i
needed
my
rest
so
i
always
went
to
bed
early
and
yesterday
friday
dundee
demanded
tensely
for
friday
she
had
been
driven
to
making
her
last
will
and
testament
she
was
home
all
day
but
about
half
past
four
drake
came
lydia
said
slowly
as
if
she
too
were
wondering
she
was
awfully
restless
could
set
still
or
eat
i
ought
to
have
suspicioned
something
but
she
was
often
like
that
lately
drake
stayed
about
an
hour
i
did
see
him
leave
because
i
was
cooking
nita
dinner
but
little
good
it
did
because
she
did
eat
it
so
there
was
plenty
for
sprague
when
he
dropped
in
about
seven
did
sprague
spend
the
evening
i
guess
so
but
i
do
know
nita
made
me
take
the
ford
and
drive
into
town
for
a
picture
show
she
was
in
bed
when
i
got
back
and
but
she
checked
herself
hastily
did
nita
seem
strange
troubled
excited
did
she
look
as
if
she
been
crying
dundee
prodded
i
did
see
her
the
maid
acknowledged
i
knocked
on
her
door
but
she
told
me
to
go
on
to
bed
that
she
would
need
me
but
now
i
think
back
her
voice
sounded
queer
maybe
she
crying
but
i
know
and
this
morning
she
seemed
all
right
just
excited
about
the
party
and
worried
about
my
tooth
ralph
hammond
come
to
make
the
estimates
on
finishing
up
the
top
floor
and
we
left
him
here
what
was
her
attitude
toward
mr
miles
when
he
dropped
in
on
her
this
morning
dundee
interrupted
mr
miles
lydia
echoed
frowning
he
was
here
this
morning
or
if
he
was
it
was
after
nita
and
i
left
for
town
while
the
maid
was
packing
a
bag
which
dundee
would
examine
before
she
was
allowed
to
take
it
away
with
her
the
detective
rejoined
tracey
miles
who
had
made
himself
as
comfortable
as
possible
in
the
living
room
lydia
going
with
you
and
is
grateful
for
your
wife
kindness
dundee
informed
him
and
felt
his
heart
warm
to
the
boresome
egotistical
little
cherub
of
a
man
when
he
saw
how
miles
face
lit
up
with
real
pleasure
by
the
way
miles
you
saw
ralph
hammond
when
you
called
here
this
morning
did
you
yes
miles
answered
with
some
reluctance
he
answered
the
door
when
i
rang
and
told
me
lydia
and
nita
had
gone
into
town
mr
miles
dundee
began
slowly
throwing
friendliness
and
persuasion
into
his
voice
i
know
how
all
you
folks
stick
together
but
appreciate
it
a
lot
if
you
tell
me
frankly
whether
you
noticed
anything
unusual
in
hammond
manner
this
morning
unusual
miles
repeated
frowning
he
was
a
little
short
with
me
because
he
was
busy
and
i
suspect
a
little
jealous
because
i
come
calling
on
nita
he
broke
off
abruptly
in
obvious
distress
look
here
dundee
i
did
mean
to
say
that
but
i
suppose
you
find
out
sooner
or
later
well
the
fact
is
the
whole
crowd
knows
ralph
hammond
was
absolutely
mad
about
nita
selim
wanted
to
marry
her
and
made
no
secret
of
it
though
we
all
thought
or
hoped
it
would
be
little
penny
crain
he
been
devoted
to
penny
for
years
and
since
roger
crain
made
a
mess
of
things
and
skipped
out
leaving
penny
and
her
poor
mother
high
and
dry
we
all
done
our
best
to
throw
penny
and
ralph
together
but
since
nita
came
to
town
was
nita
in
love
with
ralph
dundee
cut
in
rather
curtly
for
he
had
a
curious
distaste
for
hearing
penny
crain
discussed
in
this
manner
sometimes
we
were
sure
she
was
miles
answered
she
flirted
with
all
of
us
men
had
a
way
with
her
of
making
every
man
she
talked
to
think
he
was
the
only
pebble
on
the
beach
but
there
was
something
special
in
the
way
she
looked
at
ralph
yes
i
think
she
in
love
with
him
but
then
again
he
frowned
she
would
treat
him
like
a
dog
seemed
to
want
to
drive
him
away
from
her
but
she
always
called
him
back
oh
lord
he
interrupted
himself
with
a
groan
now
i
suppose
i
put
my
foot
in
it
you
got
the
damnedest
way
of
making
a
chap
tell
everything
he
would
cut
his
tongue
out
rather
than
spill
dundee
but
just
because
a
young
man
in
love
and
happens
not
to
show
up
at
a
party
is
no
reason
to
think
he
sneaked
up
to
the
house
and
killed
the
woman
he
loved
and
wanted
to
marry
for
i
not
so
dumb
that
i
have
seen
the
drift
of
your
damnable
questions
dundee
do
you
know
ralph
hammond
by
any
chance
he
concluded
his
round
face
red
with
anger
no
but
i
should
like
to
meet
him
dundee
retorted
he
seems
quite
hard
to
locate
this
evening
well
when
you
do
meet
him
tracey
miles
began
violently
his
blue
eyes
blazing
with
anger
you
soon
find
you
been
barking
up
the
wrong
tree
there
not
a
cleaner
finer
straighter
in
fact
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
miles
dundee
answered
soothingly
and
i
respect
you
for
every
word
you
said
by
the
way
did
all
of
you
go
to
the
country
club
for
dinner
after
you
left
here
somewhat
mollified
miles
answered
all
of
us
but
clive
hammond
he
said
he
was
going
to
have
a
look
around
for
ralph
himself
seemed
to
have
an
idea
where
he
might
find
him
and
oh
yes
sprague
disappeared
in
the
scramble
he
has
a
car
and
nobody
thought
of
offering
him
a
lift
guess
he
took
a
bus
into
hamilton
ah
lydia
hello
lydia
he
called
heartily
to
the
woman
who
was
standing
tall
and
gaunt
in
the
doorway
mighty
glad
you
coming
to
look
after
the
kids
from
behind
the
black
veil
which
draped
her
ugly
black
hat
and
hid
her
scarred
face
lydia
answered
in
the
dull
harsh
voice
that
was
characteristic
of
her
thank
you
sir
i
do
my
best
she
made
no
protest
when
dundee
with
a
word
of
embarrassed
apology
went
rapidly
through
the
heavy
suitcase
she
had
brought
up
from
the
basement
with
her
and
when
he
had
finished
his
fruitless
search
she
knelt
and
silently
smoothed
the
coarse
utilitarian
garments
he
had
disarranged
five
minutes
later
dundee
was
alone
in
the
house
where
murder
had
been
committed
under
such
strange
and
baffling
circumstances
that
afternoon
he
was
not
nervous
but
again
he
made
a
tour
of
inspection
of
the
first
floor
and
basement
looking
into
closets
and
testing
windows
to
make
sure
they
were
all
locked
everywhere
there
were
evidences
of
the
thoroughness
of
the
police
detectives
who
had
searched
for
the
weapon
with
which
nita
selim
had
been
murdered
in
the
basement
as
he
had
subconsciously
noted
on
his
headlong
dash
to
question
lydia
carr
the
furnace
doors
swung
open
and
the
lids
of
the
laundry
tubs
had
been
left
propped
up
after
the
unavailing
search
he
plodded
wearily
up
the
basement
stairs
and
on
into
the
kitchen
perhaps
the
had
something
fit
to
eat
in
it
the
fruit
intended
for
nita
and
lydia
sunday
breakfast
those
caviar
and
anchovy
sandwiches
had
certainly
not
stuck
with
him
long
he
was
making
his
way
toward
the
electric
refrigerator
when
he
stopped
as
suddenly
as
if
he
had
been
shot
the
kitchen
door
which
he
had
taken
especial
pains
to
assure
himself
was
locked
when
he
had
made
the
rounds
immediately
after
the
departure
of
captain
strawn
and
his
men
was
standing
slightly
ajar
had
entered
this
house
dundee
stared
blankly
at
the
door
which
was
equipped
with
a
yale
lock
someone
with
a
key
but
why
had
the
door
been
left
ajar
make
escape
more
noiseless
with
the
toe
of
his
shoe
dundee
pushed
the
door
to
and
heard
the
click
of
the
lock
then
all
thought
of
food
routed
from
his
mind
made
a
quick
but
almost
silent
dash
into
the
dining
room
to
secure
one
of
the
pair
of
tall
wax
tapers
which
in
their
silver
candlesticks
served
as
ornaments
for
the
sideboard
if
the
intruder
was
still
in
the
house
he
could
be
nowhere
but
in
that
unfinished
half
of
the
gabled
top
story
the
nearer
stairs
were
those
in
the
back
hall
and
dundee
took
them
two
at
a
time
regardless
of
the
noise
who
had
preceded
him
stealthily
by
the
aid
of
his
lighted
candle
he
discovered
an
electric
switch
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
flicked
it
on
and
found
himself
in
a
wide
hall
one
wall
of
which
was
finished
with
plaster
and
with
three
doors
the
other
of
rough
boards
with
but
a
single
door
with
his
candle
held
high
so
that
its
light
should
not
blind
him
and
well
aware
that
it
made
him
a
perfect
target
dundee
opened
the
unpainted
door
and
found
himself
in
the
dark
room
that
had
served
nita
selim
and
the
crains
before
her
as
a
storeroom
from
the
ceiling
dangled
a
green
cord
ending
in
a
cheap
bulb
but
its
light
was
sufficient
to
penetrate
even
the
farthest
low
nooks
made
by
the
three
gables
he
blew
out
his
candle
and
dropped
it
as
useless
now
a
quick
tour
convinced
him
that
nothing
human
was
concealed
behind
one
of
nita
selim
empty
wardrobe
trunks
or
behind
one
of
the
several
pieces
of
heavy
old
furniture
undoubtedly
left
behind
by
the
dispossessed
crain
family
big
footprints
on
the
thick
dust
which
coated
the
floor
showed
him
that
he
was
being
no
more
thorough
than
captain
strawn
brace
of
plainclothes
detectives
had
been
much
earlier
that
evening
two
pairs
of
giant
footprints
with
an
exclamation
he
discovered
a
smaller
narrow
pair
of
prints
and
followed
their
winding
trail
all
around
and
across
the
attic
and
then
he
remembered
ralph
hammond
footprints
of
course
made
that
morning
as
he
went
about
his
legitimate
business
of
measuring
and
estimating
for
the
job
of
turning
the
storeroom
into
bedrooms
and
bathrooms
dundee
had
not
realized
that
he
was
frightened
until
he
was
in
the
hall
again
facing
one
of
the
three
doors
in
the
plastered
wall
with
surprise
and
some
amusement
he
became
aware
that
his
hands
were
trembling
and
that
his
knees
had
a
curious
tendency
to
buckle
the
fact
that
the
door
directly
in
front
of
him
was
open
about
two
inches
served
for
some
odd
reason
to
steady
his
nerves
pushing
the
door
wide
open
with
his
foot
for
he
never
forgot
the
possibility
of
incriminating
fingerprints
which
might
easily
be
obliterated
he
discovered
a
light
switch
near
the
door
frame
the
instant
illumination
from
a
ceiling
cluster
revealed
a
large
bedroom
and
less
clearly
another
and
smaller
room
beyond
it
facing
as
the
house
faced
toward
the
south
knees
and
hands
steady
again
he
investigated
the
finished
portion
of
the
gabled
story
swiftly
a
charming
layout
he
told
himself
had
penny
crain
once
enjoyed
this
delightful
little
with
its
tiny
balcony
built
out
upon
the
sloping
roof
and
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
think
that
this
big
but
not
fussily
feminine
bedroom
had
once
been
hers
as
well
as
the
small
but
perfect
bathroom
whose
high
narrow
window
overlooked
the
back
garden
the
closets
dresser
drawers
and
highboy
drawers
were
completely
empty
however
of
any
traces
of
her
occupancy
or
that
of
any
other
with
these
rooms
going
to
waste
why
he
suddenly
asked
himself
had
nita
selim
coaxed
judge
marshall
to
have
the
unfinished
half
of
the
gabled
attic
turned
into
bedrooms
and
baths
why
could
lydia
have
slept
up
here
if
nita
thought
so
much
of
her
faithful
and
beloved
maid
but
even
as
he
asked
himself
the
question
dundee
realized
that
the
answer
to
it
had
been
struggling
to
attract
his
attention
rooms
had
not
been
wasted
someone
had
been
occupying
them
as
late
as
last
night
weaving
swiftly
through
the
three
rooms
like
a
bloodhound
on
the
scent
dundee
collected
the
few
but
sufficient
proofs
to
back
up
his
intuitive
conviction
a
copy
of
hamilton
evening
dated
friday
may
left
in
an
armchair
in
the
all
windows
raised
about
six
inches
from
the
bottom
so
that
the
night
breeze
stirred
the
linen
drapes
and
clinging
to
these
drapes
the
faint
but
unmistakable
odor
of
cigarette
smoke
finally
with
a
low
cry
of
triumph
bonnie
dundee
flung
back
the
colored
linen
spread
which
covered
the
bed
and
discovered
that
the
sheets
and
pillow
cases
though
clean
had
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
been
slept
upon
bending
so
that
his
nose
almost
touched
a
pillow
case
he
sniffed
who
was
the
man
who
had
slept
in
this
bed
last
night
chapter
fourteen
with
the
thrill
of
his
discovery
singing
blithely
along
his
nerves
bonnie
dundee
special
investigator
for
the
district
attorney
had
at
first
hugged
the
intention
of
following
the
new
trail
alone
captain
strawn
taunted
him
not
too
about
his
ability
to
get
along
without
the
younger
man
help
but
he
was
glad
both
selfishly
and
unselfishly
when
half
an
hour
later
he
threw
open
the
front
door
of
dead
nita
house
to
the
chief
of
the
homicide
squad
carraway
the
fingerprint
expert
and
the
two
plainclothesmen
who
had
searched
the
top
floor
for
the
missing
weapon
or
the
murderer
himself
soon
after
the
murder
had
been
committed
for
if
strawn
needed
his
help
dundee
needed
the
expert
machinery
which
strawn
captained
and
it
was
good
to
feel
the
grip
of
gratitude
in
the
old
chief
handclasp
and
to
see
the
almost
shy
twinkle
of
apology
in
his
hard
old
grey
eyes
dundee
led
the
way
up
the
front
stairs
to
the
upper
floor
glad
to
hear
the
heavy
tread
of
official
feet
behind
him
i
guess
you
got
it
all
doped
out
who
the
selim
woman
gentleman
friend
was
strawn
commented
genially
as
he
followed
dundee
into
the
pleasant
big
bedroom
i
believe
i
have
but
i
need
carraway
to
prove
my
hunch
dundee
acknowledged
eagerly
swiftly
he
displayed
his
first
tangible
finds
the
open
windows
the
drapes
smelling
of
cigarette
smoke
the
evening
paper
of
the
day
before
the
faint
odor
and
greasiness
of
barber
pomade
upon
the
pillow
case
of
the
bed
which
had
clearly
been
slept
in
since
the
linen
was
changed
now
collins
harmon
dundee
whirled
upon
the
two
silent
plainclothesmen
i
want
to
know
what
you
saw
in
these
rooms
when
you
searched
them
early
this
evening
that
you
do
see
now
you
looked
into
the
closets
and
drawers
of
course
yes
sir
collins
answered
and
they
was
all
empty
dundee
me
and
harmon
did
waste
time
smelling
pillow
cases
and
i
admit
we
pay
no
attention
to
that
there
newspaper
dundee
echoed
are
you
sure
you
too
harmon
what
are
you
driving
at
boy
captain
strawn
asked
indulgently
briefly
with
disappointment
flattening
his
voice
dundee
told
of
his
finding
the
kitchen
door
ajar
after
he
had
made
sure
it
was
locked
on
his
first
rounds
of
the
house
i
worked
it
out
this
way
he
continued
despite
strawn
grin
dexter
sprague
was
nita
lover
as
i
had
thought
all
along
he
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
the
night
here
whenever
nita
would
give
him
an
evening
of
her
company
he
was
here
last
night
according
to
the
maid
lydia
carr
nita
sent
her
into
hamilton
to
a
picture
show
nita
and
sprague
quarreled
last
night
but
i
am
positive
he
spent
the
night
here
anyway
certainly
there
was
no
actual
rupture
since
sprague
worded
his
note
to
her
as
he
did
i
have
another
strong
reason
for
thinking
his
belongings
were
here
at
least
until
noon
today
but
that
can
wait
for
the
moment
furthermore
i
am
positive
that
sprague
descended
by
the
backstairs
and
went
around
the
house
to
join
the
cocktail
party
which
was
to
follow
the
hen
bridge
party
how
do
you
make
that
out
bonnie
strawn
asked
his
grin
wiped
away
try
to
remember
how
sprague
looked
when
you
first
got
here
dundee
suggested
i
saw
him
twenty
minutes
after
you
did
but
was
wearing
an
immaculate
stiff
collar
and
there
were
still
traces
of
talcum
powder
over
a
close
and
you
will
remember
that
he
said
he
had
made
a
half
hour
trip
by
bus
and
had
walked
the
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
bus
stop
on
sheridan
road
to
this
house
it
was
a
mighty
hot
afternoon
chief
not
conclusive
strawn
growled
then
here
another
straw
to
add
to
the
weight
of
my
conclusion
dundee
went
on
unshaken
you
remember
that
janet
raymond
was
on
the
front
porch
for
while
the
hand
of
bridge
was
being
played
oh
she
tried
to
protect
him
wait
i
read
you
the
notes
i
made
when
i
was
questioning
her
i
looked
them
up
while
i
was
waiting
for
you
here
i
had
said
to
miss
raymond
observed
sprague
toiling
down
the
rutty
road
hot
and
weary
but
romantic
in
the
sunset
and
she
answered
stammering
i
was
looking
that
way
and
i
knew
she
was
lying
knew
that
she
had
been
taken
completely
by
surprise
when
sprague
suddenly
appeared
the
rear
of
the
what
more
she
betrayed
herself
and
him
by
admitting
that
she
was
surprised
then
because
the
girl
is
undoubtedly
in
love
with
sprague
and
was
mortally
afraid
he
had
killed
nita
selim
she
tried
frantically
to
throw
suspicion
on
lydia
carr
by
telling
how
lydia
had
failed
to
answer
dunlap
first
ring
good
lord
wait
a
minute
i
want
to
think
he
interrupted
himself
to
exclaim
after
a
full
minute
while
he
had
stood
very
still
with
his
fingers
pressed
against
his
closed
eyes
dundee
began
slowly
i
believe
that
it
listen
boys
he
turned
to
the
two
plainclothesmen
urgent
pleading
in
his
voice
would
you
both
take
your
oath
that
there
was
no
bag
say
a
small
gladstone
overnight
bag
anywhere
in
these
rooms
when
you
searched
them
this
evening
the
two
detectives
glanced
at
each
other
their
faces
reddening
it
was
harmon
the
older
of
the
pair
who
swallowed
hard
before
answering
we
been
told
to
look
for
a
man
hiding
and
for
a
gun
then
he
squared
his
shoulders
as
if
to
receive
the
blame
like
a
man
yes
sir
there
was
a
little
black
grip
on
the
closet
shelf
i
went
through
it
myself
but
there
was
no
gun
in
it
just
a
pair
of
pajamas
and
a
couple
of
shirts
one
of
dirty
some
socks
and
collars
and
a
dundee
drew
a
deep
breath
and
clapped
the
detective
on
the
back
in
high
good
humor
there
simply
to
be
a
bag
somewhere
he
laughed
this
is
the
way
of
it
strawn
nita
and
sprague
rowed
last
night
sprague
tried
to
make
it
up
but
nita
must
have
been
through
with
him
probably
told
him
last
night
to
clear
his
things
out
and
not
come
back
she
thought
he
had
done
so
probably
he
did
leave
before
she
got
up
at
any
rate
she
was
so
sure
he
was
gone
and
his
things
with
him
that
she
and
lydia
went
to
town
this
morning
and
left
ralph
hammond
here
to
go
through
the
place
as
freely
as
he
liked
making
his
estimates
on
the
job
of
finishing
up
the
other
half
of
this
floor
and
ralph
but
let
that
wait
for
the
moment
got
any
real
proof
that
it
was
sprague
who
stayed
here
and
not
the
hammond
boy
strawn
interrupted
shrewdly
i
coming
to
the
proof
dundee
assured
him
or
rather
the
rest
of
the
proof
that
i
have
already
given
you
you
damned
hard
to
convince
chief
but
let
me
go
on
with
my
theory
which
i
think
covers
the
facts
at
luncheon
when
nita
received
that
note
from
sprague
i
imagine
she
got
a
hunch
that
he
had
taken
her
seriously
that
he
had
not
removed
his
belongings
you
remember
penny
crain
said
nita
had
lydia
follow
her
into
her
bedroom
as
soon
as
nita
got
home
from
the
luncheon
well
it
my
hunch
that
nita
asked
lydia
if
things
were
gone
when
she
cleaned
these
rooms
this
morning
and
that
lydia
said
no
nita
then
probably
told
lydia
to
pack
them
herself
and
i
feel
positive
that
lydia
did
so
for
she
must
have
felt
safe
when
she
protested
to
me
that
sprague
was
not
nita
lover
i
also
feel
sure
that
sprague
arrived
at
least
half
an
hour
before
he
said
he
did
by
some
back
path
across
the
meadow
that
he
came
up
to
these
rooms
that
he
considered
his
found
his
things
packed
but
went
about
shaving
and
changing
his
shirt
and
collar
regardless
i
also
feel
sure
that
lydia
followed
him
upstairs
to
explain
and
impress
upon
him
that
nita
had
meant
what
she
said
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
she
was
not
through
picking
up
after
him
when
he
descended
by
the
back
stairs
and
surprised
janet
raymond
on
the
front
porch
that
accounts
of
course
for
not
hearing
the
kitchen
bell
the
first
time
dunlap
rang
umm
strawn
grunted
what
about
the
proofs
you
holding
back
come
along
chief
you
too
carraway
dundee
answered
and
led
the
way
into
the
bathroom
i
felt
sure
these
rooms
would
yield
a
very
definite
clue
even
though
sprague
when
he
sneaked
back
tonight
to
get
his
bag
apparently
made
every
effort
to
wipe
his
fingerprints
off
the
furniture
and
bathroom
fixtures
now
carraway
if
step
upon
this
little
stool
and
look
along
the
top
of
this
medicine
cabinet
you
find
what
i
found
and
did
touch
the
fingerprint
expert
did
as
he
was
told
when
he
stepped
down
he
was
holding
between
the
very
tips
of
his
fingers
a
safety
razor
blade
no
dust
on
it
you
see
dundee
pointed
out
now
if
you
do
find
dexter
sprague
fingerprints
on
it
my
whole
theory
topples
how
am
i
going
to
know
whose
fingerprints
they
are
till
we
get
hold
of
sprague
carraway
asked
reasonably
we
do
need
him
for
that
purpose
at
least
dundee
assured
him
downstairs
in
the
living
room
on
a
little
table
in
the
southeast
corner
of
the
room
you
find
a
red
glass
ashtray
which
no
one
but
dexter
sprague
used
all
evening
it
was
clean
and
empty
when
i
saw
him
use
it
first
i
think
you
find
on
it
all
the
prints
you
need
so
you
think
sprague
killed
her
because
she
was
through
with
him
strawn
asked
dundee
shook
his
head
since
i
do
like
dexter
sprague
a
little
bit
chief
i
like
to
think
so
but
chapter
fifteen
bonnie
dundee
first
thought
upon
awakening
that
sunday
morning
was
that
it
might
prove
to
be
rather
a
pity
that
his
new
bachelor
apartment
as
he
loved
to
call
his
three
rooms
at
the
top
of
a
lodging
house
which
had
once
been
a
fashionable
private
home
faced
south
and
west
rather
than
east
at
the
rhodes
house
whose
clamor
and
lack
of
privacy
he
had
abandoned
upon
taking
the
flattering
job
and
decent
salary
of
special
investigator
attached
to
the
district
office
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
using
the
hot
morning
sun
upon
his
reluctant
eyelids
as
an
alarm
clock
but
he
continued
the
train
of
thought
after
discovering
by
his
watch
that
it
was
not
late
only
it
was
pretty
darned
nice
having
diggings
like
these
quiet
and
private
for
he
was
the
only
tenant
now
on
the
top
floor
his
pleased
lazy
eyes
roved
over
the
plain
severity
but
solid
comfort
of
his
bedroom
and
on
past
the
open
door
to
take
in
appreciatively
the
equally
comfortable
and
masculine
living
room
pretty
nice
that
couch
and
armchair
had
been
a
real
bargain
and
he
liked
them
all
the
better
for
being
rather
scuffed
and
shabby
then
his
eyes
halted
upon
a
covered
cage
swung
from
a
pedestal
poor
old
must
be
wondering
when
the
devil
i
going
to
get
up
and
he
swung
out
of
bed
lounged
sleepily
into
the
small
living
room
and
whisked
the
square
of
black
silk
from
the
cage
the
parrot
formerly
the
property
of
murdered
old
hogarth
of
the
rhodes
house
but
for
the
past
year
the
young
detective
official
watson
ruffled
his
feathers
poked
his
head
between
the
bars
of
his
cage
and
croaked
hoarsely
hullo
hullo
hullo
yourself
my
dear
watson
dundee
retorted
your
vacation
is
over
old
top
it
back
on
the
job
for
you
and
me
both
which
reminds
me
that
i
ought
to
be
taking
a
squint
at
the
sunday
papers
to
see
how
much
captain
strawn
thought
fit
to
tell
the
press
he
found
hamilton
morning
in
the
hall
just
outside
his
living
room
door
listen
selim
murdered
at
bridge
probably
the
snappiest
streamer
headline
the
news
has
had
for
many
a
day
now
let
see
he
was
silent
for
two
minutes
while
his
eyes
leaped
down
the
lesser
headlines
and
the
column
one
page
one
story
of
the
murder
then
good
old
strawn
not
a
word
my
dear
watson
about
your
absurd
master
absurd
performance
in
having
death
hand
at
replayed
not
a
word
about
ralph
hammond
the
missing
guest
not
a
word
about
tracey
miles
being
hidden
away
in
the
clothes
closet
while
her
hostess
was
being
murdered
in
fact
my
dear
watson
not
a
word
about
anything
except
strawn
own
theory
that
a
hired
gunman
from
new
york
or
chicago
preferably
nita
home
town
new
york
of
course
sneaked
up
crouched
in
her
window
and
bumped
her
off
photographs
of
the
big
footprints
under
the
window
to
prove
his
theory
by
golly
i
clean
forgot
to
tell
my
former
chief
that
i
found
nita
will
and
note
to
lydia
he
think
i
deliberately
held
out
on
him
well
i
ca
sit
here
all
day
gossiping
with
you
dear
watson
work
much
work
to
be
done
then
sunday
dinner
with
poor
little
penny
four
hours
later
a
tired
and
dispirited
young
detective
was
climbing
the
stairs
of
an
ugly
apartment
house
in
which
penny
crain
and
her
mother
had
been
living
since
the
financial
failure
and
flight
of
the
husband
and
father
roger
crain
hello
there
it
was
penny
friendly
voice
hailing
him
from
the
topmost
landing
of
the
steep
stairs
all
winded
poor
thing
his
tired
unhappy
eyes
drank
her
in
the
freshness
and
sweetness
of
a
domestic
penny
so
different
from
the
thorny
little
office
penny
who
prided
herself
on
her
efficiency
as
secretary
to
the
district
attorney
penny
in
flowered
voile
with
a
saucy
ruffled
white
apron
but
there
were
purplish
shadows
under
her
brown
eyes
and
her
gayety
lasted
only
until
he
had
reached
her
side
have
they
found
ralph
she
whispered
anxiously
he
could
only
answer
no
and
he
almost
choked
on
the
word
mother
all
of
a
twitter
at
my
having
a
detective
to
dinner
she
whispered
trying
to
be
gay
again
she
fancies
you
be
wearing
size
shoes
and
a
at
your
belt
yes
mother
it
mr
dundee
she
did
not
look
all
of
a
twitter
this
pretty
but
rather
faded
little
mother
of
penny
a
gentle
dignity
and
patient
sadness
which
dundee
was
sure
were
habitual
to
her
lay
in
the
faded
blue
eyes
and
upon
the
soft
sweet
mouth
but
crain
was
ushering
him
into
the
living
room
and
its
charm
made
him
forget
for
the
moment
that
the
crains
were
to
be
pitied
because
of
their
in
life
for
every
piece
of
furniture
seemed
to
be
authentic
early
american
and
the
hooked
rugs
and
fine
brocaded
damasks
allied
themselves
with
the
fine
old
furniture
to
defeat
the
ugliness
with
which
the
maple
court
apartments
architect
had
been
fiercely
determined
to
punish
its
tenants
me
got
ta
dish
up
penny
flung
over
her
shoulder
as
she
ran
away
and
left
him
alone
with
her
mother
dundee
liked
crain
for
making
no
excuses
about
a
maid
they
could
not
afford
liked
the
way
she
settled
into
a
lovely
ancient
and
set
herself
to
entertain
him
while
her
daughter
made
ready
the
dinner
not
a
word
was
said
about
the
horrible
tragedy
which
had
occurred
the
day
before
in
the
house
which
had
once
been
her
home
they
talked
of
penny
work
and
the
little
gentlewoman
listened
eagerly
with
only
the
faintest
of
sighs
as
dundee
humorously
described
penny
fierce
efficiency
and
district
attorney
sanderson
keen
delight
in
her
work
bill
sanderson
is
a
nice
boy
the
woman
of
perhaps
said
of
hamilton
district
attorney
it
is
nice
for
penny
to
work
with
an
old
friend
of
the
family
or
was
until
and
that
was
the
nearest
she
came
to
mentioning
the
murder
before
penny
summoned
them
to
the
little
dining
room
because
penny
was
watching
him
and
was
obviously
proud
of
her
skill
as
a
cook
skill
recently
acquired
he
was
sure
dundee
ate
as
heartily
as
his
carefully
concealed
depression
would
permit
there
was
a
beautifully
browned
roast
of
beef
potatoes
new
peas
escalloped
tomatoes
and
for
dessert
a
gelatine
pudding
which
penny
proudly
announced
was
spanish
cream
the
secret
of
which
she
had
mastered
only
that
morning
i
was
up
almost
at
dawn
to
make
it
so
that
it
would
in
time
she
told
him
and
by
the
quiver
of
her
lip
dundee
knew
that
it
was
not
spanish
cream
which
had
got
her
up
i
going
to
help
wash
dishes
he
announced
firmly
and
penny
with
a
quick
intake
of
breath
agreed
had
you
better
take
a
nap
mother
she
added
a
minute
later
as
crain
with
a
slight
flush
on
her
faded
cheeks
began
to
stack
the
dessert
dishes
you
must
lay
a
hand
on
these
dishes
or
bonnie
and
i
will
have
our
dishwashing
picnic
spoiled
run
along
now
you
need
sleep
dear
not
any
more
than
you
do
poor
baby
crain
quavered
and
then
hurried
out
of
the
room
since
gentlewomen
do
not
weep
before
strangers
i
called
you
so
mother
would
know
we
are
really
friends
penny
explained
her
cheeks
red
as
she
preceded
him
through
the
swinging
door
into
the
miniature
kitchen
you
stick
to
that
being
friends
i
mean
no
matter
what
happens
wo
you
penny
dundee
said
in
a
low
voice
setting
the
fragile
crystal
dishes
he
carried
upon
the
porcelain
drainboard
of
the
sink
i
knew
you
had
something
bad
to
tell
me
it
about
ralph
i
suppose
her
husky
voice
was
scarcely
audible
above
the
rush
of
hot
water
into
the
dishpan
you
better
tell
me
straight
off
bonnie
not
a
very
patient
person
are
they
going
to
arrest
ralph
when
they
find
him
there
was
a
word
in
the
paper
about
him
this
morning
i
afraid
they
are
penny
dundee
told
her
miserably
captain
strawn
has
a
warrant
ready
but
of
course
oh
you
do
have
to
tell
me
you
hope
ralph
is
guilty
she
cut
in
with
sudden
passionate
vehemence
do
know
he
could
have
done
it
they
always
arrest
the
wrong
person
first
the
blundering
idiots
it
was
the
thorny
penny
again
the
penny
with
glittering
eyes
which
matched
her
nickname
but
dundee
felt
better
able
to
cope
with
this
penny
i
afraid
i
the
chief
idiot
but
you
must
believe
that
i
sorry
it
should
be
a
friend
of
yours
he
told
her
and
reached
for
the
plate
she
had
rinsed
of
its
suds
under
the
hot
water
tap
shoot
the
works
she
commanded
with
hard
flippancy
of
course
i
might
have
known
that
captain
strawn
theory
about
a
gunman
was
just
dust
in
our
eyes
and
that
only
a
miracle
could
keep
you
from
fastening
on
poor
ralph
since
he
and
the
gun
are
both
missing
naturally
it
would
occur
to
you
that
it
might
be
an
outsider
someone
who
had
followed
nita
and
her
lover
sprague
from
new
york
to
kill
her
for
having
left
him
for
sprague
oh
no
certainly
not
she
gibed
to
keep
from
bursting
into
tears
an
outsider
would
hardly
have
had
access
to
judge
marshall
pistol
and
maxim
silencer
he
reminded
her
and
captain
strawn
received
a
wire
from
a
ballistics
expert
in
chicago
this
morning
confirming
our
conviction
that
the
same
gun
which
fired
the
bullets
against
judge
marshall
target
fired
the
bullet
which
killed
nita
selim
washed
that
plate
long
enough
let
me
dry
it
now
and
there
are
other
things
penny
such
as
she
challenged
in
her
angry
husky
contralto
sprague
admitted
to
me
this
morning
after
i
had
confronted
him
with
proofs
that
he
sometimes
slept
in
the
upstairs
bedroom
i
told
you
they
were
lovers
penny
and
that
he
slept
there
friday
night
after
he
and
nita
had
quarreled
he
still
contends
that
the
row
was
over
that
business
dundee
went
on
as
if
she
had
not
spoken
he
admitted
also
that
nita
had
told
him
to
take
his
things
away
when
he
left
saturday
morning
but
he
says
it
was
only
because
she
did
want
ralph
hammond
to
find
a
man
belongings
there
if
he
had
occasion
to
go
into
the
upstairs
rooms
in
making
his
estimates
for
the
of
the
other
side
but
he
contends
and
lydia
carr
whom
i
also
saw
again
this
morning
supports
him
in
it
that
he
stayed
in
the
house
occasionally
when
nita
was
particularly
nervous
about
being
alone
and
that
they
were
lovers
pooh
do
wipe
the
flowers
off
that
plate
here
another
i
inclined
to
say
too
penny
dundee
assured
her
but
tracey
miles
told
me
last
night
when
he
came
to
get
lydia
that
nita
really
seemed
to
be
in
love
with
ralph
part
of
the
time
at
least
nita
thought
enough
of
dexter
sprague
to
send
for
him
to
come
down
here
and
to
root
her
head
off
for
him
to
get
the
job
of
making
the
movie
penny
reminded
him
fiercely
making
a
great
splashing
in
the
dishpan
then
do
think
she
was
in
love
with
ralph
dundee
asked
oh
do
the
girl
cried
i
thought
so
sometimes
had
the
grace
to
hope
so
anyway
since
ralph
was
so
crazy
about
her
that
the
point
penny
dundee
told
her
gently
everyone
i
talked
to
this
morning
including
sprague
seems
sure
that
ralph
hammond
was
mad
about
nita
selim
so
of
course
he
would
kill
her
penny
scoffed
bitterly
yes
penny
when
he
discovered
sprague
cravats
draped
over
the
mirror
frame
in
a
bedroom
in
nita
house
for
they
were
there
to
be
seen
when
ralph
went
into
that
bedroom
yesterday
morning
how
do
you
know
he
saw
them
because
he
left
this
behind
him
dundee
admitted
reluctantly
and
wiped
his
hands
before
drawing
an
initialed
silver
pencil
from
his
breast
pocket
i
found
it
under
the
edge
of
the
bed
the
initials
are
yes
i
recognize
it
penny
admitted
turning
sharply
away
i
gave
it
to
him
myself
for
a
christmas
present
i
thought
i
could
afford
to
give
silver
pencils
away
then
dad
had
bolted
yet
she
crooked
an
elbow
and
leaned
her
face
against
it
for
a
moment
then
she
flung
up
her
brown
bobbed
head
defiantly
well
ralph
must
have
been
well
in
a
pretty
bad
way
since
he
loved
nita
and
wanted
to
marry
her
dundee
persisted
painfully
remember
that
polly
beale
found
him
still
there
when
she
stopped
to
offer
nita
a
lift
to
breakaway
inn
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
what
took
place
we
that
polly
curtly
cancelled
her
luncheon
engagement
with
nita
and
the
rest
of
you
and
went
into
town
with
ralph
after
making
sure
that
clive
would
join
them
i
saw
young
hammond
myself
for
an
instant
without
knowing
who
he
was
and
i
remember
now
thinking
that
he
looked
far
too
ill
to
eat
i
was
lunching
at
the
stuart
house
myself
when
they
came
into
the
dining
room
you
know
plenty
to
hang
him
on
i
see
penny
cried
furiously
there
a
little
more
penny
dundee
went
on
polly
beale
and
clive
hammond
were
mortally
afraid
that
ralph
come
to
the
cocktail
party
i
sure
clive
made
ralph
promise
to
stay
away
and
that
both
clive
and
polly
did
not
trust
him
to
keep
his
promise
that
is
why
i
am
sure
clive
beckoned
polly
to
join
him
in
the
solarium
without
entering
the
living
room
to
speak
to
nita
you
remember
they
said
they
stayed
there
all
during
the
playing
of
if
you
call
it
the
hand
again
i
scream
all
right
they
stayed
there
until
karen
discovered
the
murder
i
am
sure
they
chose
that
place
because
of
its
many
windows
they
could
watch
for
ralph
car
dash
out
and
head
him
off
take
him
away
by
force
if
necessary
to
keep
him
from
making
a
scene
i
believe
they
knew
he
had
murder
in
his
heart
and
that
he
would
find
a
way
to
get
a
gun
have
you
also
found
out
that
he
stole
hugo
gun
yesterday
i
have
found
that
it
was
possible
for
him
to
do
so
dundee
said
slowly
the
butler
was
off
for
the
afternoon
until
six
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
but
the
nursemaid
and
baby
well
and
i
suppose
you
think
clive
and
polly
did
have
a
chance
to
head
ralph
off
as
you
say
but
that
they
did
see
him
running
away
after
he
killed
her
her
voice
was
still
brittle
with
anger
but
there
were
indecision
and
fear
in
it
too
no
dundee
replied
i
do
think
they
saw
him
i
feel
pretty
sure
he
came
into
the
house
by
the
back
way
and
through
the
back
hall
into
nita
room
he
must
have
known
clive
and
polly
would
be
on
the
lookout
for
him
at
any
rate
i
have
proof
that
whoever
shot
nita
from
in
front
of
that
window
near
the
porch
door
fled
toward
the
back
hall
and
he
told
her
of
the
big
bronze
lamp
whose
bulb
had
been
broken
reminding
her
of
its
place
at
the
head
of
the
chaise
longue
which
was
set
between
the
two
west
windows
that
was
the
or
bump
flora
miles
heard
while
she
was
hiding
in
the
closet
he
explained
i
suppose
flora
has
told
all
of
you
about
it
i
thought
so
muffled
as
she
was
in
the
closet
it
is
unlikely
that
she
could
have
heard
nita
frantic
whisperings
to
ralph
i
doubt
if
he
spoke
at
all
nita
must
have
been
sure
he
was
about
to
leave
by
the
porch
door
dimly
there
came
the
ring
of
the
telephone
with
a
curt
word
penny
excused
herself
to
answer
it
dundee
went
on
polishing
glasses
with
a
fresh
towel
bonnie
penny
was
coming
back
walking
like
a
somnambulist
her
brown
eyes
wide
and
fixed
that
was
ralph
he
does
even
know
nita
is
dead
chapter
sixteen
of
course
i
recognized
his
voice
instantly
when
he
said
you
penny
and
it
a
wonder
i
did
scream
said
penny
crain
fighting
her
way
up
through
dazed
bewilderment
to
explain
in
detail
in
answer
to
dundee
pelting
questions
i
said
course
ralph
where
you
been
and
said
in
that
coaxing
teasing
voice
of
his
that
i
know
so
well
penny
i
do
blame
you
honey
you
really
ought
not
to
let
me
come
over
and
explain
why
i
stood
you
up
last
night
but
you
will
wo
you
penny
that
exactly
how
he
talked
bonnie
dundee
exactly
do
you
see
he
could
know
that
nita
is
dead
did
you
ask
him
where
he
was
dundee
asked
finally
no
i
just
told
him
to
come
on
over
and
he
said
i
could
depend
on
it
that
he
would
waste
any
time
oh
bonnie
what
shall
we
listen
penny
dundee
urged
rapidly
you
must
realize
that
i
got
to
see
and
hear
but
i
do
want
ralph
hammond
to
see
until
after
he
had
a
talk
with
you
will
you
let
me
eavesdrop
behind
these
portieres
i
know
it
a
beastly
thing
to
do
but
penny
agreed
at
last
and
within
ten
minutes
after
that
amazing
telephone
call
dundee
from
behind
the
portieres
that
separated
the
dining
and
living
room
heard
penny
greeting
her
visitor
in
the
little
foyer
she
had
played
fair
had
not
gone
out
into
the
hall
to
whisper
a
warning
if
any
warning
was
needed
he
had
seen
ralph
hammond
enter
the
dining
room
of
the
stuart
house
the
day
before
in
company
with
clive
hammond
and
polly
beale
when
the
three
had
been
strangers
to
him
but
dundee
told
himself
now
that
he
would
hardly
have
recognized
the
young
man
whom
penny
was
preceding
into
her
living
room
the
ralph
hammond
of
saturday
had
had
a
white
drawn
face
and
sick
eyes
but
this
boy
like
his
older
brother
clive
ralph
hammond
had
curling
hair
but
unlike
his
brother
his
eyes
were
a
wide
candid
hazel
the
green
iris
thickly
flecked
with
brown
a
little
shorter
than
clive
a
trifle
more
slender
but
that
which
held
the
detective
eyes
was
something
less
tangible
but
at
once
more
evident
than
superlative
masculine
good
looks
it
was
a
sort
of
shy
joyousness
and
buoyance
which
flushed
the
tan
of
his
cheeks
sang
in
his
voice
made
his
eyes
almost
unbearably
bright
before
penny
crain
very
pale
and
quiet
could
sink
into
the
chair
she
was
groping
toward
ralph
hammond
was
at
her
side
one
arm
going
out
to
encircle
her
shoulders
do
look
like
that
penny
dundee
heard
him
plead
his
voice
suddenly
humble
you
every
right
to
be
sore
at
me
honey
but
please
do
be
i
know
i
been
an
awful
cad
these
last
few
weeks
but
myself
again
i
cured
now
penny
wait
ralph
penny
protested
faintly
holding
back
as
he
would
have
hugged
her
hard
against
his
breast
what
about
nita
dundee
saw
the
young
man
face
go
darkly
red
but
heard
him
answer
almost
steadily
i
hoped
you
understand
without
making
me
put
it
into
words
honey
i
cured
of
nita
i
ca
express
it
any
other
way
except
to
say
i
was
sick
and
now
i
cured
you
mean
penny
faltered
but
with
a
swift
imploring
glance
toward
dundee
you
do
love
nita
any
more
you
ca
deny
you
were
terribly
in
love
with
her
ralph
lois
told
us
told
last
night
that
nita
had
told
her
in
strictest
confidence
that
she
had
promised
to
marry
you
just
thursday
night
the
boy
face
was
very
pale
as
he
dropped
his
hands
from
shoulders
but
dundee
from
behind
the
portieres
was
not
troubling
to
spy
for
the
moment
he
was
too
indignant
with
penny
for
having
withheld
from
him
the
vital
fact
of
nita
engagement
to
ralph
hammond
that
true
penny
ralph
was
saying
dully
you
have
a
right
to
know
because
i
asking
to
marry
me
now
i
did
propose
to
nita
again
thursday
night
and
she
did
accept
me
i
confess
now
i
was
wild
with
happiness
why
did
she
refuse
you
before
penny
cut
in
and
dundee
silently
thanked
her
for
asking
the
question
he
would
have
liked
to
ask
himself
was
it
because
she
was
sure
she
was
in
love
with
you
you
making
it
awfully
hard
for
me
honey
the
boy
protested
then
admitted
humbly
of
course
you
want
to
know
and
you
should
know
no
she
said
all
along
almost
from
the
first
that
she
loved
me
more
than
i
could
love
her
but
that
there
were
reasons
she
always
said
and
once
i
asked
her
jealously
if
they
were
both
men
but
she
looked
so
startled
and
then
laughed
so
queerly
that
i
did
ask
again
then
i
thought
it
might
be
because
i
was
younger
than
she
was
though
i
ca
believe
she
is
more
than
or
so
and
i
you
know
and
once
i
got
because
i
thought
she
might
still
be
married
but
she
said
her
husband
was
married
again
and
i
was
to
ask
questions
or
worry
about
him
but
she
accept
you
thursday
night
penny
persisted
yes
the
boy
admitted
his
face
darkly
flushed
again
this
is
awfully
hard
honey
but
i
tell
you
once
for
all
and
get
it
over
with
i
took
her
to
dinner
we
drove
to
burnsville
because
she
said
she
was
sick
of
hamilton
when
we
were
driving
back
she
suddenly
became
very
queer
reckless
defiant
and
she
asked
me
if
i
still
wanted
to
marry
her
and
i
said
i
did
i
asked
her
right
then
to
say
when
and
she
said
she
marry
me
june
first
but
she
added
and
the
boy
to
watching
eyes
seemed
to
be
genuinely
puzzled
again
by
what
must
have
sounded
so
odd
at
the
time
that
she
marry
me
june
first
she
lived
to
see
the
oh
penny
gasped
then
controlling
her
horror
she
asked
with
what
sounded
like
real
curiosity
then
what
happened
ralph
why
do
you
propose
to
on
thursday
and
to
on
on
sunday
a
gorgeous
actress
sacrificed
to
the
typewriter
dundee
told
himself
as
he
waited
for
ralph
hammond
reluctant
reply
ca
we
forget
it
honey
you
do
love
me
a
little
do
you
you
take
my
word
for
it
that
i
cured
now
forever
penny
hands
went
up
to
cover
her
face
and
dundee
had
the
grace
to
feel
very
sorry
indeed
for
her
sorry
even
if
she
intended
to
give
her
promise
to
ralph
hammond
as
a
sick
feeling
in
his
stomach
prophesied
that
she
was
about
to
do
how
can
i
know
you
really
cured
if
i
do
know
what
cured
you
i
suppose
you
right
the
boy
admitted
miserably
there
no
need
to
ask
you
not
to
tell
anyone
else
although
i
do
want
to
see
her
again
ever
why
penny
i
would
even
tell
polly
and
clive
yesterday
after
it
happened
though
polly
guessed
and
went
upstairs
i
tried
to
keep
her
back
i
do
quite
understand
ralph
penny
interrupted
you
mean
something
happened
when
you
were
at
nita
house
yesterday
morning
yes
judge
marshall
had
promised
nita
to
have
the
unfinished
half
of
the
top
story
turned
into
a
maid
bedroom
and
bath
and
a
guest
bedroom
and
bath
clive
let
me
go
to
make
the
estimates
of
course
i
was
glad
of
the
chance
to
see
nita
again
i
had
been
with
her
since
thursday
night
but
she
had
to
take
lydia
in
for
a
dentist
appointment
and
they
left
me
alone
in
the
house
i
had
to
go
into
the
finished
half
to
make
some
measurements
and
in
the
bedroom
i
found
oh
god
he
groaned
and
pressed
a
fist
against
his
trembling
mouth
you
found
that
dexter
sprague
was
staying
there
was
using
the
bedroom
that
used
to
be
mine
did
you
penny
helped
him
at
last
in
desperation
how
did
you
know
the
boy
stared
at
the
girl
blankly
for
a
moment
then
seemed
to
crumple
as
if
from
a
new
blow
i
suppose
it
was
common
gossip
that
nita
and
sprague
were
lovers
and
i
was
the
only
one
she
fooled
my
god
to
think
all
of
you
would
stand
by
and
let
me
her
a
cheap
little
from
broadway
living
with
a
cheap
she
could
get
along
without
and
had
to
send
for
did
you
want
to
kill
her
ralph
penny
whispered
touching
one
of
his
knotted
fists
with
a
trembling
hand
kill
her
good
lord
the
boy
flung
at
her
violently
i
not
such
an
ass
as
that
you
girls
are
all
alike
polly
had
so
little
sense
as
to
think
i
want
to
kill
nita
and
sprague
both
she
could
see
and
neither
could
clive
that
all
i
wanted
was
to
get
away
from
everybody
and
get
so
drunk
i
could
forget
what
a
fool
i
been
what
you
do
ralph
penny
asked
urgently
why
i
got
drunk
of
course
the
boy
answered
as
if
surprised
at
her
persistence
darling
you
would
believe
me
if
i
told
you
how
much
scotch
it
took
to
put
me
under
but
that
filthy
bootlegging
hotel
clerk
would
have
charged
me
twice
what
he
did
for
the
stuff
if
he
had
known
how
much
good
it
would
do
me
hotel
penny
snatched
at
the
vital
word
where
did
you
go
to
get
drunk
ralph
i
never
realized
before
you
had
so
much
curiosity
honey
the
boy
grinned
at
her
after
i
shook
clive
polly
went
on
to
nita
bridge
party
because
she
could
throw
her
down
at
the
last
minute
i
wandered
around
till
i
came
to
the
railroad
men
hotel
down
on
state
street
you
know
the
other
side
of
the
tracks
it
a
miserable
dump
but
i
sort
of
hankered
for
a
place
to
hide
in
that
was
as
miserable
and
cheap
as
i
felt
did
you
register
under
your
own
name
ashamed
of
me
penny
no
i
registered
under
my
first
two
names
ralph
edwards
and
the
filthy
little
hotel
clerk
turned
out
to
be
a
bootlegger
well
when
i
woke
up
about
eleven
this
morning
i
give
you
my
word
i
was
sick
and
headachy
though
god
knows
i
drunk
enough
to
put
me
out
for
a
week
penny
i
woke
up
feeling
well
i
ca
explain
it
but
to
say
i
felt
light
and
new
and
and
clean
all
at
first
i
thought
my
heart
was
empty
it
felt
so
free
of
pain
but
as
i
lay
there
thanking
god
that
was
i
found
my
heart
was
empty
at
all
it
was
brimming
full
of
love
gosh
honey
i
sound
like
a
laura
jean
libbey
hero
i
but
before
i
rang
you
from
the
lunch
room
where
i
ate
breakfast
i
wrote
nita
a
special
delivery
note
telling
her
it
was
all
off
i
had
to
be
free
actually
before
i
could
ask
you
you
marry
me
you
penny
honey
i
knew
this
morning
i
had
never
really
loved
anyone
else
penelope
crain
remained
rigid
for
a
moment
then
very
slowly
she
laid
both
her
hands
on
his
head
for
he
had
knelt
and
buried
his
face
against
her
skirt
but
as
she
spoke
her
brown
eyes
enormous
in
her
white
face
were
upon
dundee
who
had
stepped
silently
from
behind
the
portieres
yes
i
marry
you
ralph
you
may
come
in
now
mr
dundee
chapter
seventeen
it
was
nearly
nine
monday
morning
and
special
investigator
dundee
sat
alone
in
the
district
attorney
office
impatiently
awaiting
sanderson
arrival
coroner
price
with
the
approval
of
captain
strawn
of
the
homicide
squad
had
set
the
inquest
into
the
murder
of
juanita
leigh
selim
for
ten
and
there
was
much
that
dundee
wished
to
say
to
the
district
attorney
before
that
hour
arrived
when
the
thoroughly
tired
and
dispirited
young
detective
had
returned
to
his
apartment
late
sunday
afternoon
after
having
seen
ralph
hammond
completely
exonerated
of
any
possible
complicity
in
the
murder
of
nita
selim
he
had
found
a
telegram
from
the
district
attorney
filed
in
chicago
called
chicago
serious
illness
of
mother
stop
returning
hamilton
eight
ten
monday
morning
stop
see
by
papers
you
are
on
selim
job
stop
good
but
watch
your
step
sanderson
well
and
dundee
grinned
ruefully
he
had
been
on
the
job
all
right
but
would
sanderson
consider
that
he
had
watched
his
step
at
any
rate
he
had
been
thorough
he
congratulated
himself
as
he
weighed
the
big
manilla
envelope
containing
his
own
transcription
of
the
copious
shorthand
notes
he
had
taken
during
the
first
hours
of
the
investigation
a
smaller
envelope
held
nita
checkbook
her
amazing
last
will
and
testament
and
the
still
more
startling
note
she
had
written
to
lydia
carr
the
last
two
dundee
had
retrieved
from
carraway
only
this
morning
after
having
submitted
them
to
the
fingerprint
expert
on
sunday
carraway
report
had
rather
dashed
him
at
first
for
it
proved
that
no
other
hands
than
nita
and
his
own
of
course
had
touched
either
envelope
or
contents
but
he
was
content
now
to
believe
that
nita
herself
had
unsealed
the
envelope
she
had
inscribed
to
be
opened
in
case
of
my
death
why
had
she
been
moved
by
an
impulse
to
give
a
clue
to
the
identity
of
the
person
of
whom
she
stood
in
fear
but
had
stifled
the
impulse
strawn
had
said
too
that
the
little
rosewood
desk
had
been
in
a
fairly
orderly
condition
before
his
big
official
hands
had
clawed
through
it
in
search
of
a
clue
or
the
gun
itself
well
strawn
had
been
properly
chagrined
when
dundee
had
produced
the
will
and
note
why
did
she
stick
it
away
in
a
pack
of
new
envelopes
if
she
wanted
it
to
be
found
strawn
had
demanded
irritably
and
had
not
been
appeased
by
dundee
suggestion
because
she
did
not
want
lydia
in
dusting
the
desk
to
see
it
and
be
alarmed
yes
he
had
been
busy
enough
but
what
actually
had
he
to
show
for
his
industry
he
had
worked
up
three
good
cases
the
first
against
lydia
carr
the
second
against
dexter
sprague
and
the
third
against
ralph
hammond
only
to
have
them
knocked
to
pieces
almost
as
fast
as
he
had
conceived
them
of
course
lydia
carr
might
be
lying
to
give
sprague
an
alibi
but
dundee
was
convinced
that
she
was
telling
the
truth
and
that
she
hated
sprague
too
much
to
fake
an
alibi
for
him
of
course
there
was
always
judge
marshall
but
through
the
closed
door
came
sounds
which
dundee
presently
identified
as
connected
with
penny
crain
arrival
the
emphatic
click
of
her
heels
the
quick
opening
and
shutting
of
desk
drawers
the
young
detective
debated
the
question
of
taking
his
perplexities
out
to
her
but
decided
against
it
she
probably
wanted
to
hear
no
more
of
his
theories
was
undoubtedly
burning
with
righteous
indignation
against
him
because
of
ralph
hammond
did
she
still
consider
herself
engaged
to
ralph
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
young
hammond
had
gallantly
insisted
upon
releasing
her
from
her
promise
as
soon
as
he
suspected
that
it
had
been
given
merely
to
prove
her
faith
in
his
innocence
it
was
a
decidedly
unhappy
young
detective
whom
sanderson
greeted
upon
his
arrival
at
nine
the
new
district
attorney
who
had
held
office
since
november
was
a
big
tolerant
man
who
looked
younger
than
his
years
because
of
his
freckles
and
his
always
rumpled
mop
of
sandy
hair
but
those
who
sought
to
take
advantage
of
his
good
nature
in
the
courtroom
found
themselves
up
against
as
keen
a
lawyer
and
prosecutor
as
could
be
found
in
the
whole
state
or
even
in
the
middle
west
well
boy
he
greeted
dundee
genially
but
with
an
undertone
of
solemnity
in
his
rich
baritone
looks
like
we
got
a
sensational
murder
on
our
hands
it
not
every
day
hamilton
can
rate
a
headline
like
belle
murdered
at
bridge
to
quote
a
chicago
paper
but
i
afraid
there
not
enough
mystery
in
it
to
suit
your
tastes
dundee
grinned
wryly
i
been
pretty
down
in
the
mouth
all
morning
because
there
a
little
too
much
mystery
chief
fairly
is
it
sanderson
asked
obviously
surprised
new
york
gets
too
hot
for
this
selim
baby
probably
mixed
up
with
some
racketeer
racketeers
being
the
favorite
of
belles
if
one
can
believe
the
tabloids
lois
dunlap
offers
her
a
job
to
organize
a
little
theater
in
hamilton
which
the
fair
nita
would
certainly
have
described
as
a
hick
town
and
which
she
would
have
been
found
dead
in
if
she
could
have
helped
it
and
the
district
attorney
grinned
at
his
own
witticism
but
broadway
nita
jumps
at
it
her
racketeer
sweetie
has
a
long
arm
however
and
nita
gets
hers
justly
enough
probably
but
i
wish
to
the
lord
she
had
chosen
some
other
town
to
hide
in
lois
dunlap
is
the
finest
woman
in
hamilton
but
she
too
damned
promiscuous
in
her
friendships
as
it
is
now
some
of
the
best
friends
i
have
in
the
world
are
mixed
up
in
this
mess
even
if
it
is
only
as
innocent
victims
of
circumstance
until
then
dundee
had
let
his
chief
express
his
convictions
without
interruption
and
indeed
sanderson
courtroom
training
had
fitted
him
admirably
for
long
speeches
but
he
could
keep
silent
no
longer
that
is
what
has
been
worrying
me
chief
he
interrupted
captain
strawn
has
given
the
papers
very
little
real
information
but
the
truth
is
i
am
afraid
of
your
friends
was
not
an
innocent
victim
of
circumstance
district
attorney
sanderson
sat
down
abruptly
in
the
swivel
chair
at
his
desk
just
what
do
you
mean
dundee
i
mean
i
am
convinced
that
one
of
selim
was
her
murderer
but
i
like
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
and
let
you
judge
for
yourself
my
god
sanderson
ejaculated
slowly
he
drew
out
a
handkerchief
and
mopped
his
freckled
brow
if
i
had
had
a
good
many
years
of
experience
with
criminals
dundee
i
say
it
is
obvious
on
the
face
of
it
that
none
of
those
four
men
judge
marshall
tracey
miles
johnny
drake
clive
hammond
could
have
committed
such
a
cheap
sensational
crime
as
murdering
a
hostess
during
a
bridge
game
not
that
i
wanted
to
commit
murder
myself
over
many
a
game
of
bridge
he
added
with
the
irrepressible
humor
for
which
he
was
famous
then
he
groaned
the
rueful
twinkle
still
in
his
eye
i
afraid
we
in
for
a
lot
of
gruesome
kidding
why
last
night
in
the
club
car
of
my
train
three
tables
of
bridge
players
could
scarcely
play
a
hand
for
wisecracking
about
the
dangers
of
being
dummy
well
boy
now
that
i
talked
myself
past
the
worst
shock
suppose
you
give
me
the
but
i
warn
you
i
going
to
take
a
powerful
lot
of
convincing
painstakingly
and
in
the
greatest
detail
dundee
told
the
whole
story
beginning
with
his
arrival
saturday
evening
at
the
selim
house
including
the
ghastly
replaying
of
the
death
hand
at
bridge
a
phrase
by
the
way
which
the
prosecutor
instantly
adopted
and
ending
with
ralph
hammond
establishing
of
an
alibi
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
captain
strawn
as
well
as
of
dundee
himself
he
was
interrupted
frequently
of
course
scoffingly
at
first
then
with
deepening
solemnity
and
respect
on
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
let
me
see
the
plan
of
the
house
again
he
said
when
dundee
had
finished
also
that
table
you
worked
up
showing
the
approximate
time
and
order
of
arrival
of
the
four
men
thanks
hmm
hmm
you
see
sir
dundee
repeated
at
last
the
list
of
possible
suspects
includes
lydia
carr
dexter
sprague
john
drake
judge
marshall
polly
beale
flora
miles
janet
raymond
clive
hammond
but
polly
and
clive
were
in
the
solarium
all
the
time
sanderson
objected
so
they
said
dundee
agreed
but
it
is
a
very
short
trip
from
the
solarium
by
way
of
the
side
porch
into
nita
bedroom
and
either
polly
beale
or
clive
hammond
could
have
made
that
trip
on
the
pretext
of
speaking
to
nita
about
ralph
motive
murder
to
end
blackmail
naturally
such
a
theory
would
not
include
of
them
but
if
of
was
being
blackmailed
and
made
use
of
the
pretext
of
warning
nita
of
ralph
overwrought
condition
sprague
your
man
sanderson
interrupted
with
relief
motive
jealousy
because
nita
was
ditching
him
to
marry
ralph
as
for
the
gun
and
silencer
it
seems
pretty
clear
to
me
that
nita
herself
stole
it
from
judge
marshall
and
that
sprague
got
it
away
from
her
you
say
the
maid
lydia
went
upstairs
to
tell
sprague
he
had
to
pack
his
things
and
take
them
away
for
good
very
well
sprague
goes
down
the
backstairs
with
the
gun
in
his
pocket
through
the
back
hall
into
nita
bedroom
shoots
her
bumps
into
the
lamp
goes
out
by
the
back
door
and
comes
around
front
to
join
the
party
you
say
yourself
he
has
admitted
to
everything
but
the
trip
to
nita
room
and
the
shooting
even
to
sneaking
back
to
get
his
bag
which
i
believe
also
contained
the
gun
until
he
had
a
chance
to
dispose
of
it
on
his
way
to
his
hotel
in
hamilton
dundee
shook
his
head
i
like
to
agree
chief
but
i
believe
lydia
is
telling
the
truth
she
says
she
was
in
the
upstairs
bedroom
with
sprague
and
remained
behind
only
two
or
three
minutes
at
most
to
put
his
shaving
kit
into
the
packed
bag
and
to
clean
up
the
bathroom
basin
on
her
way
down
the
backstairs
she
says
she
heard
lois
dunlap
second
ring
and
went
to
answer
it
sprague
and
janet
raymond
with
whom
janet
says
he
stopped
to
talk
a
minute
on
the
front
porch
were
in
the
dining
room
lydia
entered
it
i
convinced
lydia
hates
sprague
and
would
be
glad
to
believe
him
guilty
no
sanderson
i
believe
sprague
did
it
but
i
do
believe
it
was
sprague
revenge
that
nita
was
afraid
of
when
she
made
her
will
friday
night
naturally
she
figured
she
have
time
to
tell
the
person
she
was
blackmailing
that
she
was
through
with
him
or
her
but
i
believe
sprague
and
nita
were
lovers
even
partners
in
blackmail
and
that
she
feared
he
would
kill
her
when
he
knew
she
was
going
to
marry
ralph
hammond
and
give
up
their
source
of
income
sanderson
considered
for
a
long
minute
pulling
at
his
full
lower
lip
well
thank
god
for
those
precious
footprints
strawn
is
building
on
do
think
i
fail
to
follow
your
reasoning
that
the
crime
have
been
committed
in
the
bedroom
and
not
from
the
window
sill
but
those
footprints
may
save
us
yet
and
will
certainly
get
us
through
the
inquest
you
agree
of
course
that
none
of
all
this
you
told
me
must
even
be
hinted
at
during
the
inquest
good
let
be
going
nearly
ten
dundee
whole
soul
revolted
at
the
very
thought
of
the
barbaric
farce
of
an
inquest
the
small
morgue
chapel
crowded
to
the
doors
with
humanity
the
stretcher
with
its
sheeted
corpse
reporters
avid
of
sensation
and
primed
with
questions
which
if
answered
by
indiscreet
witnesses
would
defeat
the
efforts
of
police
and
district
attorney
news
photographers
with
their
insatiable
cameras
aimed
at
every
person
connected
with
the
case
in
any
way
mercifully
this
particular
inquest
upon
the
body
of
juanita
leigh
selim
promised
to
be
quickly
over
for
coroner
price
in
conference
with
sanderson
dundee
and
captain
strawn
had
gladly
agreed
to
call
only
those
witnesses
and
extract
from
them
only
such
information
as
the
authorities
deemed
advisable
lydia
carr
whose
black
veil
had
defeated
the
news
camera
levelled
at
her
poor
scarred
face
was
the
first
witness
called
by
coroner
price
and
she
was
required
for
the
single
purpose
of
identifying
the
body
as
that
of
her
mistress
to
two
perfunctory
questions
have
you
any
information
to
give
this
jury
regarding
the
cause
and
manner
of
the
deceased
death
and
have
you
any
personal
knowledge
of
the
identity
of
any
person
man
or
woman
of
whom
the
deceased
stood
in
fear
of
her
life
lydia
answered
a
flat
no
and
was
then
dismissed
karen
marshall
looking
far
too
young
to
be
the
wife
of
the
elderly
hugo
marshall
was
the
second
witness
called
price
guided
her
gently
to
a
brief
recital
of
her
discovery
of
the
dead
body
of
her
hostess
emphasizing
only
the
fact
that
so
far
as
she
could
see
the
bedroom
was
unoccupied
except
by
the
corpse
at
the
time
of
the
discovery
he
then
handed
her
the
photostatic
copy
of
a
blueprint
of
the
ground
floor
of
the
selim
house
with
a
pencilled
ring
drawn
around
the
bedroom
karen
falteringly
identified
it
as
well
as
the
furniture
and
was
immediately
dismissed
to
the
packed
rows
of
spectators
and
reporters
price
himself
took
the
stand
next
and
described
in
technical
terms
the
wound
which
had
caused
death
and
the
caliber
of
the
bullet
he
had
extracted
from
the
dead
woman
heart
i
find
also
from
the
autopsy
he
concluded
that
the
bullet
traveled
a
path
i
should
add
moreover
that
i
have
made
exact
mathematical
calculations
using
the
position
of
the
body
and
of
the
wound
as
a
basis
and
found
that
a
line
drawn
from
the
wound
and
extended
at
the
correct
slant
ends
at
a
point
inches
high
upon
the
side
of
the
frame
of
the
window
nearest
the
porch
door
and
he
obligingly
passed
the
marked
blueprint
among
the
jury
when
it
was
in
his
own
hands
again
he
added
it
is
impossible
to
state
the
exact
distance
the
bullet
traveled
more
nearly
than
to
say
the
shot
was
fired
along
the
line
i
have
indicated
at
a
distance
of
not
more
than
fifteen
feet
and
not
less
than
ten
captain
strawn
rose
and
was
permitted
to
question
the
witness
price
that
blueprint
shows
that
the
bedroom
is
fifteen
feet
in
width
do
it
that
is
correct
have
you
also
measured
the
height
of
that
window
sill
from
the
floor
i
have
the
coroner
answered
the
height
from
floor
to
sill
is
inches
now
doctor
from
your
calculations
would
it
be
possible
for
a
man
crouching
in
the
open
window
to
fire
a
shot
along
the
path
you
have
calculated
it
would
price
answered
but
as
i
have
pointed
out
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
at
exactly
what
distance
from
the
body
the
shot
was
fired
but
strawn
of
course
was
amply
satisfied
and
so
were
dundee
and
the
district
attorney
for
it
suited
their
purposes
admirably
for
the
public
to
be
convinced
at
this
time
that
an
intruding
gunman
had
murdered
nita
selim
captain
strawn
sworn
in
told
briefly
of
his
being
called
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
of
the
activities
of
carraway
the
fingerprint
expert
and
of
the
exhaustive
search
of
his
squad
of
detectives
did
you
find
any
person
concealed
upon
the
premises
that
is
within
the
house
itself
or
in
the
garage
or
on
the
grounds
price
asked
no
sir
did
you
or
your
men
discover
the
weapon
with
which
the
deceased
was
killed
no
sir
did
you
question
all
persons
in
the
house
at
the
time
of
the
crime
as
to
whether
or
not
a
shot
had
been
heard
i
did
the
answer
in
every
case
was
that
they
heard
no
shot
and
you
also
questioned
every
person
present
in
an
effort
to
place
responsibility
for
the
death
of
mrs
selim
i
did
i
could
find
that
anyone
present
had
anything
to
do
with
it
who
were
these
persons
price
then
asked
judge
and
hugo
marshall
and
tracey
a
miles
and
john
drake
peter
dunlap
miss
janet
raymond
miss
polly
beale
miss
penelope
crain
clive
hammond
dexter
sprague
of
new
york
and
selim
maid
lydia
carr
captain
strawn
answered
promptly
rolling
out
the
names
of
hamilton
elect
with
sonorous
satisfaction
which
obviously
had
the
desired
effect
in
convincing
the
jury
that
not
among
those
proud
names
at
least
could
be
found
the
name
of
the
murderer
did
you
find
on
the
premises
any
clue
which
you
consider
of
importance
to
this
jury
i
did
a
bunch
of
footprints
under
the
window
you
been
talking
about
here
are
photographs
of
doctor
and
the
rambler
rose
vines
that
climb
up
the
outside
of
the
window
had
been
torn
after
the
photographs
had
been
duly
inspected
by
the
jury
of
six
price
said
that
is
all
and
thank
you
captain
strawn
mr
dundee
as
had
been
agreed
between
the
coroner
and
the
district
attorney
dundee
testimony
after
the
preliminary
questions
was
confined
to
the
offering
of
nita
selim
last
will
and
testament
and
the
note
to
lydia
the
reporters
who
had
obviously
feared
that
nothing
new
would
eventuate
sat
up
with
startled
interest
then
their
pencils
flew
as
dundee
read
the
two
documents
after
he
had
told
when
and
where
he
had
discovered
them
as
district
attorney
sanderson
had
said
better
give
the
press
something
new
to
chew
on
but
for
god
sake
do
mention
that
checkbook
of
nita
it
dynamite
boy
dynamite
while
the
morgue
chapel
was
still
in
a
buzz
of
excitement
dundee
was
dismissed
and
district
attorney
sanderson
requested
an
adjournment
of
the
inquest
for
one
week
the
police
were
urging
the
crowd
upon
its
way
before
it
became
fully
aware
that
it
had
been
cheated
of
the
pleasure
of
hearing
at
first
hand
the
stories
of
that
fatal
bridge
and
cocktail
party
from
the
guests
themselves
tell
the
carr
woman
i
want
to
speak
to
her
sanderson
directed
dundee
she
thank
you
for
rescuing
her
from
the
reporters
as
dundee
pushed
his
way
through
the
jam
he
heard
a
reporter
earnestly
pleading
with
lois
dunlap
but
i
sure
you
can
remember
the
cards
each
player
held
in
that
hand
dunlap
cheerfully
sure
that
he
could
trust
lois
dunlap
discretion
and
distaste
for
publicity
dundee
went
on
grinning
at
the
reporter
use
of
his
own
lurid
phrase
two
minutes
later
sanderson
strawn
and
dundee
were
closeted
in
price
own
office
with
lydia
carr
first
lydia
began
sanderson
i
want
to
warn
you
to
give
the
reporters
no
information
at
all
regarding
the
nature
or
extent
of
your
mistress
bequest
it
was
little
enough
she
had
poor
girl
beyond
her
clothes
and
a
few
pieces
of
jewelry
lydia
answered
stubbornly
are
you
going
to
let
me
do
what
she
told
me
to
in
that
note
not
that
i
hold
with
burning
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
take
charge
of
the
body
lydia
and
arrange
it
immediately
for
cremation
do
you
captain
strawn
sanderson
answered
no
sir
the
quicker
the
better
then
lydia
if
captain
strawn
will
send
you
out
to
the
selim
house
with
one
of
his
boys
you
may
get
the
dress
described
in
note
and
the
curls
she
cut
off
and
had
made
into
switches
lydia
interrupted
i
ca
dress
my
poor
girl
hair
in
a
french
roll
without
them
the
curls
too
sanderson
agreed
now
as
to
the
cremation
mrs
miles
let
me
come
in
early
to
see
about
that
lydia
interrupted
again
they
can
do
it
this
afternoon
and
you
do
need
to
worry
about
the
expense
i
got
money
enough
of
my
own
to
pay
my
girl
funeral
expenses
good
sanderson
applauded
the
will
shall
be
probated
as
soon
as
possible
of
course
but
it
makes
it
simpler
if
you
will
pay
the
necessary
expenses
now
just
a
minute
chief
dundee
halted
the
district
attorney
as
he
was
about
to
leave
under
the
circumstances
i
think
it
highly
advisable
that
we
get
pictures
of
the
burial
dress
i
suggest
you
have
lydia
bring
the
things
to
your
office
before
she
lays
out
the
body
and
that
carraway
photograph
the
dress
there
from
all
angles
i
should
also
like
to
have
a
picture
of
the
body
after
lydia
has
finished
her
services
the
maid
scarred
face
flushed
a
deep
angry
red
but
she
offered
no
protest
when
the
district
attorney
accepted
both
of
suggestions
then
you
have
carraway
with
his
camera
at
my
office
in
about
an
hour
sanderson
turned
to
captain
strawn
let
say
twelve
by
the
way
lydia
you
may
bring
in
with
you
the
few
pieces
of
jewelry
you
mentioned
i
keep
them
safely
in
my
offices
until
the
will
is
probated
and
they
are
turned
over
to
you
i
do
know
where
she
kept
them
lydia
answered
exclaimed
bonnie
dundee
i
said
i
do
know
where
she
kept
her
jewelry
lydia
carr
retorted
it
was
worth
much
not
a
hundred
dollars
altogether
i
be
bound
because
nita
sold
her
last
diamond
not
a
week
before
we
left
new
york
she
owed
so
many
bills
then
that
the
money
she
got
for
directing
that
play
at
the
forsyte
school
hardly
made
a
dent
on
them
do
you
know
whether
the
jewelry
was
kept
in
the
house
or
in
a
safe
deposit
box
dundee
asked
excitement
sharpening
his
voice
it
must
have
been
in
the
house
because
she
wore
the
different
pieces
any
time
she
pleased
the
maid
answered
i
did
ask
no
questions
and
i
did
happen
to
see
her
get
it
out
or
put
it
away
i
did
ever
do
much
work
for
her
like
dressing
her
or
fixing
her
hair
just
kept
her
clothes
and
the
house
in
order
and
did
what
little
cooking
there
was
to
do
her
dundee
prodded
her
desk
the
maid
shook
her
head
i
was
always
straightening
up
the
drawers
in
both
her
and
her
desk
and
she
did
keep
the
jewelry
in
either
one
of
them
places
captain
strawn
when
you
searched
the
and
desk
for
the
gun
or
anything
of
importance
did
you
have
any
reason
to
suspect
a
secret
drawer
in
either
of
them
no
bonnie
they
just
ordinary
factory
furniture
i
tapped
around
for
a
secret
drawer
of
course
but
there
was
even
any
place
for
one
strawn
assured
him
with
an
indulgent
grin
i
want
to
see
penny
crain
dundee
cried
making
for
the
door
then
you
better
come
along
to
the
courthouse
with
me
sanderson
called
after
him
i
sent
her
back
to
the
office
as
soon
as
the
inquest
was
adjourned
the
two
men
passed
through
the
now
deserted
morgue
chapel
and
almost
bumped
into
a
man
obviously
of
the
laboring
class
in
spite
of
his
sunday
appearance
you
the
district
attorney
ai
you
sir
he
addressed
sanderson
in
a
nervous
halting
undertone
yes
what
is
it
i
come
to
the
inquest
to
give
some
information
sir
but
it
was
adjourned
so
quick
i
did
have
time
who
are
you
sanderson
interrupted
impatiently
i
rawlins
sir
i
worked
for
the
poor
lady
selim
gardening
one
day
a
week
come
to
my
office
sanderson
commanded
quickly
as
a
lingering
reporter
approached
on
a
run
no
no
i
sorry
harper
he
said
hastily
cutting
into
the
reporter
questions
nothing
new
you
may
say
that
the
police
have
thrown
out
a
dragnet
and
he
grinned
at
the
trite
phrase
for
the
gunman
who
killed
selim
and
will
offer
a
reward
for
the
recovery
of
the
weapon
a
colt
equipped
with
a
maxim
silencer
come
along
george
and
i
explain
just
what
sanderson
and
i
have
in
mind
the
district
attorney
and
dundee
strode
quickly
away
and
the
man
rawlins
after
a
moment
of
indecision
trotted
after
them
i

my
name

have
to
understand

except

reporter
asks

sanderson
retorted
when
the
trio
entered
the
reception
room
of
the
district
suite
in
the
courthouse
sanderson
paused
at
penny
crain
desk
bring
in
your
notebook
penny
this
man
has
some
information
he
considers
important
a
minute
later
sanderson
had
begun
to
question
his
voluntary
but
highly
nervous
witness
your
name
it
elmer
rawlins
like
i
told
you
sir
the
man
protested
and
flinched
as
penny
recorded
his
words
in
swift
shorthand
it
was
my
wife
as
made
me
come
she
said
as
long
as
me
and
her
knowed
i
did
do
nothing

sanderson
encouraged
him
impatiently

for
selim
as
gardener
one
day
a
week
yes
sir
but
i
to
her
hot
water
and

a
day
it
was
i
had
to
go
and
stoke
the
little
laundry
heater
that
heats
the
hot
water
tank
in
summertime
when
the
steam
furnace
ai

i
live
about
a
mile
beyant
the
crain
place
that
is
the
house

poor
lady

killed
in
did
you
come
to
stoke
the
laundry
heater
saturday
evening
dundee
interrupted
excuse
me
sir
he
turned
to
the
district
attorney
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
seen
this
man
no
sir
i
did
stoke
it
night
rawlins
answered
uneasily
you
see
i
was
comin
up
the
road
to
do
my
chores
at
half
past
six
like
i
always
do
but
before
i
got
to
the
house
i
seen
a
lot
of
policemen
cars
and
motorcycles
and
i
did
want
to
get
mixed
up
in
nothing
so
i
turned
around
and
went
home
again
i
did
know
what
was
up
but
when
me
and
the
wife
went
into
hamilton
night
in
our
flivver
we
seen
one
of
the
extries
and
read
about
how
the
poor
lady
was
murdered
but
that
ai
what
i
was
gittin
at
sir
well
what
you
getting
at
sanderson
urged
well
the
extry
said
the
police
had
found
some
footprints
under
the
frontmost
of
them
two
side
windows
to
mis
selim
bedroom
and
went
on
to
talk
about
the
rose
vines
being
tore
and
straight
off
i
said
to
the
missus
footprints
minnie
minnie
my
wife
name
footprints
sanderson
ejaculated
then
shook
with
silent
laughter
there
goes
strawn
case
bonnie
but
immediately
he
was
serious
again
as
the
import
of
this
new
evidence
came
to
him
tell
us
all
about
it
rawlins
when
did
you
make
those
footprints
friday
sir
that
the
day
i
gardened
for
mis
selim
you
see
sir
the
poor
little
lady
told
me
she
was
kept
awake
nights
when
they
was
a
high
wind
by
the
rose
vines
tapping
against
the
windows
says
she
think
they
somebody
tryin
to
git
into
my
room
elmer
and
i
could
see
the
poor
little
thing
was
mighty
nervous
anyway
so
i
did
waste
no
time
i
cut
away
a
lot
of
the
rose
vine
and
burned
it
when
i
was
burnin
the
garbage
and
papers
in
the
out
back
is
that
all
rawlins
sanderson
asked
all
that
to
anything
the
laborer
deprecated
but
they
was
somethin
else
that
struck
me
as
a
little
funny
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
well
sanderson
prodded
as
the
man
halted
uncertainly
well
it
like
i
told
you
it
was
my
job
to
burn
the
papers
that
maid
of
mis
selim
put
everything
garbage
and
trash
in
a
big
garbage
can
outside
the
back
door
and
i
burnt
up
so
i
was
kinder
surprised
mornin
when
i
went
to
stoke
up
the
laundry
heater
to
find
somebody
been
meddlin
with
my
drafts
and
had
let
the
fire
go
clean
out
i
had
to
clean
out
the
ashes
and
build
a
new
fire
you
trying
to
say
i
suppose
that
you
could
tell
by
the
ashes
that
someone
had
been
burning
papers
in
the
laundry
heater
sanderson
asked
with
a
quick
glance
at
dundee
tense
face
that
right
sir
rawlins
agreed
eagerly
you
know
what
kind
of
ashes
a
mess
o
paper
makes
layers
of
white
ashes
sir
that
kinder
looks
like
papers
yit
yes
i
know
and
you
found
layers
of
white
ashes
which
you
took
particular
pains
to
clean
out
sanderson
asked
bitterly
yes
sir
so
i
could
build
a
new
fire
did
you
speak
to
the
maid
ask
her
if
she
been
with
your
drafts
yes
sir
i
did
the
man
answered
with
a
trace
of
the
belligerence
he
had
undoubtedly
shown
to
lydia
she
said
did
open
no
dampers
claimed
the
heater
was
the
same
as
usual
when
she
left
friday
night
to
go
to
a
movie
so
i
reckin
it
was
the
poor
lady
herself
burnin
up
love
letters
maybe
or
some
such
truck
you
to
keep
your
to
yourself
rawlins
sanderson
cut
in
emphatically
remember
now
you
not
to
tell
anybody
else
what
you
just
told
me
if
that
all
you
can
go
now
and
i
much
obliged
to
you
leave
your
address
with
the
young
lady
here
you
be
needed
later
of
course
the
relieved
man
hurried
out
of
the
room
on
penny
heels
sanderson
shrugged
then
when
the
door
had
closed
began
heavily
it
looks
like
you
right
bonnie
about
that
blackmail
business
as
the
astute
rawlins
says
letters
maybe
or
some
such
truck
of
course
it
all
fits
in
with
your
theory
that
nita
had
made
up
her
mind
to
reform
marry
ralph
hammond
and
be
a
very
good
girl
indeed
all
right
you
can
have
penny
in
now
i
think
i
know
pretty
well
what
you
going
to
ask
her
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
when
roger
crain
skipped
town
with
some
securities
he
was
known
to
possess
he
had
got
them
from
a
safe
deposit
box
because
he
did
have
one
and
sanderson
pressed
a
button
on
the
edge
of
his
desk
penny
do
you
know
whether
there
is
a
concealed
safe
in
the
selim
house
the
girl
startled
began
to
shake
her
head
then
checked
herself
not
that
i
ever
saw
or
knew
of
when
dad
and
mother
and
i
lived
there
but
she
hesitated
her
cheeks
turning
scarlet
out
with
it
penny
sanderson
urged
his
voice
very
kind
it
just
that
if
you
really
think
there
a
secret
hiding
place
in
the
house
i
believe
i
understand
something
that
puzzled
me
when
it
happened
penny
confessed
her
head
high
i
was
at
the
country
club
one
night
a
saturday
night
when
the
whole
crowd
is
usually
there
for
the
dinner
and
dance
i
been
dancing
with
with
ralph
and
when
the
music
stopped
we
went
out
on
the
porch
where
several
of
our
crowd
were
sitting
it
was
just
two
or
three
weeks
after
after
dad
left
town
lois
would
let
me
drop
out
of
things
anyway
it
was
dark
and
i
heard
judge
marshall
saying
something
about
simplest
and
most
ingenious
arrangement
you
ever
saw
of
course
that
where
the
rascal
kept
his
securities
i
knew
they
were
talking
about
dad
from
the
way
judge
marshall
shut
up
and
changed
the
subject
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
who
was
on
the
porch
penny
dundee
asked
tensely
why
let
see
flora
and
johnny
drake
and
clive
she
answered
slowly
i
think
that
was
all
besides
judge
marshall
the
others
come
out
from
dancing
of
course
i
do
know
whether
or
not
it
was
some
in
the
house
where
are
you
going
boy
sanderson
checked
dundee
who
was
already
on
his
way
to
the
door
to
find
that
gun
of
course
well
if
it
tucked
away
in
the
and
most
ingenious
arrangement
you
ever
saw
it
will
stay
put
for
a
while
sanderson
said
lydia
due
here
within
half
an
hour
and
you
do
want
to
miss
her
do
you
chapter
eighteen
it
was
exactly
twelve
when
lydia
carr
accompanied
by
detective
collins
of
the
homicide
squad
carrying
a
small
suitcase
arrived
at
the
district
attorney
office
i
kept
my
eye
on
her
every
minute
of
the
time
to
see
that
there
no
shenanigans
collins
informed
dundee
and
sanderson
importantly
callous
to
the
fact
that
the
maid
could
hear
him
but
i
let
her
bring
along
everything
she
said
she
needed
to
lay
the
body
out
in
was
that
right
right
agreed
the
district
attorney
as
dundee
opened
the
suitcase
upon
sanderson
desk
the
royal
blue
velvet
dress
lay
on
top
neatly
folded
dundee
shook
out
its
folds
it
looked
remarkably
fresh
and
new
in
spite
of
the
years
it
had
hung
in
nita
selim
various
clothes
closets
preserved
because
of
god
alone
knew
what
tender
memories
perhaps
the
beautiful
little
dancer
had
intended
all
those
years
that
it
should
be
her
shroud
oh
it
lovely
penny
crain
who
was
looking
on
cried
out
involuntarily
it
looks
like
a
french
model
it
a
copy
of
a
french
model
you
can
see
by
the
label
on
the
back
of
the
neck
lydia
answered
her
one
good
eye
softening
for
penny
so
it
is
dundee
agreed
and
took
out
his
penknife
to
snip
the
threads
which
fastened
the
white
satin
label
to
the
frock
model
copied
by
simonson
new
york
city
he
read
aloud
and
slipped
the
little
square
of
satin
into
the
envelope
containing
the
murdered
woman
will
well
penny
i
glad
you
like
the
dress

i
going
to
ask
you
to
do
the
mannikin
stunt
in
it
as
soon
as
carraway
arrives
with
his
camera
penny
turned
very
pale
but
she
said
nothing
in
protest
and
dundee
continued
to
unpack
the
suitcase
his
masculine
hands
looked
clumsy
as
they
lifted
out
the
costume
slip
and
miniature
dancing
set
brassiere
and
all
matching
of
filmiest
white
chiffon
and
lace
his
fingers
flinched
from
contact
with
the
switch
of
long
silky
black
curls
she
bought
them
after
we
came
to
hamilton
lydia
informed
him

to

undergarments

pumps

us
if
the
statements

lydia
accepted
the
paper
and
her
single
eye
scanned
the
following
lines
obediently
new
york
may
up
juanita
leigh
selim
who
was
murdered
saturday
afternoon
in
hamilton
was
known
along
broadway
as
nita
leigh
chorus
girl
and
specialty
dancer
her
last
known
address
in
new
york
was
no
west
where
she
had
a
apartment
according
to
the
superintendent
j
black
miss
leigh
as
he
knew
her
lived
there
alone
except
for
her
maid
lydia
carr
and
entertained
few
visitors
irving
wein
publicity
director
for
altamont
pictures
when
interviewed
by
a
reporter
in
his
rooms
at
the
cadillac
hotel
late
today
said
that
nita
leigh
had
been
used
for
bits
and
as
a
dancing
double
for
stars
in
a
number
of
recent
pictures
including
night
life
and
boy
howdy
both
of
which
have
dancing
sequences
musical
comedy
programs
for
the
last
year
carry
her
name
only
once
in
the
list
of
ladies
of
the
ensemble
of
the
revue
what
of
it
miss
eloise
pendleton
of
mentioned
in
the
dispatches
from
hamilton
confirms
the
report
that
selim
as
she
was
known
there
twice
directed
the
annual
easter
musical
comedy
presented
by
that
fashionable
school
for
young
ladies
but
could
add
nothing
of
interest
to
the
facts
given
above
beyond
asserting
that
selim
had
proved
to
be
an
unusually
competent
and
popular
director
of
their
amateur
theatricals
yes
that
correct
as
far
as
it
goes
lydia
commented
resentment
strong
in
her
harsh
voice
as
she
returned
the
paper
to
dundee
have
you
anything
to
add
dundee
caught
her
up
quickly
no
sir
lydia
shook
her
head
her
lips
in
a
grim
line
then
resentment
burst
through
they
do
have
to
talk
like
she
was
a
back
number
on
broadway
just
because
she
was
tired
of
the
stage
and
going
in
for
movies
district
attorney
sanderson
took
her
in
hand
then
pelting
her
with
questions
about
nita
new
york
gentlemen
friends
but
he
made
no
more
headway
than
dundee
we
that
nita
selim
was
afraid
of
sanderson
began
again
angrily
who
was
it
someone
she
known
in
new
york
or
somebody
in
hamilton
i
do
know
lydia
told
him
flatly
but
you
do
know
she
was
living
in
fear
of
her
life
do
you
dundee
interposed
i
well
yes
i
suppose
she
was
lydia
admitted
reluctantly
but
i
thought
she
was
just
afraid
to
live
out
there
in
that
lonesome
house
away
off
at
the
end
of
nowhere
was
she
afraid
of
dexter
sprague
sanderson
shot
at
her
would
she
have
asked
him
to
stay
all
night
if
she
been
afraid
of
lydia
demanded
scornfully
and
would
she
have
asked
to
rig
up
a
bell
from
her
bedroom
to
mine
if
it
was
she
was
afraid
of
a
bell
dundee
echoed
yes
sir
it
has
a
contraption
under
the
rug
right
beside
her
bed
so
she
could
step
on
it
and
it
would
ring
in
my
room
which
was
underneath
hers
sprague
bought
the
wire
and
stuff
bored
a
hole
through
her
bedroom
floor
and
fixed
it
all
hisself
did
anyone
know
nita
had
taken
this
precaution
to
protect
herself
dundee
asked
mis
lois
did
because
one
day
not
long
ago
she
stepped
on
it
accidentally
when
she
was
in
nita
room
the
bell
buzzed
in
my
room
and
i
come
up
to
answer
it
and
nita
explained
it
to
mis
lois
so
that
was
why
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
murder
nita
while
she
slept
dundee
told
himself
triumphantly
for
of
course
it
was
more
than
probable
that
lois
dunlap
had
innocently
spread
the
news
of
nervousness
and
her
ingenious
method
of
summoning
help
instantly
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
all
finished
carraway
fine
i
like
to
see
the
prints
as
soon
as
possible
and
now
i
like
you
to
go
over
to
the
morgue
with
lydia
and
wait
there
until
she
has
the
body
dressed
in
these
clothes
and
the
hair
done
according
to
the
instructions
selim
left
leave
the
posing
to
you
but
i
want
a
picture
as
well
as
a
head
portrait
as
lydia
knuckly
hands
were
returning
the
funeral
clothes
to
the
suitcase
another
question
occurred
to
dundee
lydia
did
you
know
before
i
questioned
you
at
the
miles
home
yesterday
that
sprague
had
returned
for
that
bag
he
had
left
in
the
bedroom
upstairs
her
scarred
cheek
flushed
livid
but
the
maid
answered
with
defiant
honesty
yes
i
did
he
spoke
to
me
through
my
basement
window
just
before
you
come
running
down
to
talk
to
me
he
sneaked
back
but
he
could
tell
from
seeing
your
car
outside
that
you
was
there
and
he
asked
me
to
go
up
and
get
the
bag
and
set
it
outside
the
kitchen
door
for
him
i
said
i
would
do
it
it
was
too
risky
then
you
were
pretending
to
be
asleep
when
i
entered
your
room
yes
i
was
but
i
been
asleep
before
sprague
called
me
while
you
was
at
me
about
nita
burning
my
face
i
heard
sprague
open
the
kitchen
door
he
had
a
key
nita
had
give
him
so
he
could
slip
in
unnoticed
if
he
happened
to
come
when
nita
had
other
company
he
did
hardly
make
any
noise
at
all
but
i
heard
it
because
i
was
listening
for
it
you
left
the
door
to
the
basement
stairs
open
and
my
door
too
so
i
heard
him
did
you
hear
him
come
down
yes
i
did
there
a
board
on
the
backstairs
that
squeaks
and
i
heard
it
plain
while
you
was
still
at
me
hammer
and
tongs
lydia
answered
he
was
in
the
house
not
two
minutes
all
told
and
when
i
figured
he
was
safely
out
i
went
upstairs
with
you
to
show
you
the
presents
i
give
nita
after
she
burnt
me
to
prove
i
forgive
her
why
did
you
tell
me
lydia
why
did
you
protect
sprague
i
know
you
do
like
him
dundee
puzzled
i
was
thinking
about
him
lydia
told
him
flatly
i
was
thinking
about
nita
i
did
want
any
scandal
on
her
and
i
knew
what
the
police
and
the
newspapers
would
say
if
they
found
out
sprague
had
been
staying
all
night
sometimes
are
you
prepared
to
swear
sprague
had
time
to
do
nothing
but
go
up
to
the
bedroom
and
get
his
bag
i
am
when
lydia
and
carraway
had
left
together
dundee
rose
and
addressed
the
district
attorney
i
going
out
to
the
selim
house
now
to
look
for
that
secret
hiding
place
where
roger
crain
kept
his
securities
and
which
judge
marshall
evidently
displayed
to
nita
as
one
of
the
charms
of
the
house
when
she
it
why
not
simply
telephone
judge
marshall
and
ask
him
where
and
what
it
is
sanderson
asked
reasonably
do
you
think
he
tell
dundee
retorted
the
old
boy
no
fool
even
if
he
did
kill
nita
himself
and
hide
the
gun
there
my
question
would
throw
him
into
a
panic
of
fear
lest
one
of
his
best
friends
had
done
just
that
no
i
find
it
myself
if
it
all
right
with
you
but
after
a
solid
hour
of
hard
and
fruitless
work
bonnie
dundee
was
forced
to
admit
ruefully
to
himself
that
his
parting
words
to
the
district
attorney
might
have
been
the
youthful
and
empty
boast
that
sanderson
had
evidently
considered
them
for
nowhere
in
the
house
roger
crain
had
built
and
in
which
nita
selim
had
been
murdered
could
the
detective
find
anything
remotely
resembling
a
concealed
safe
the
two
plainclothesmen
whom
strawn
had
detailed
to
guard
the
house
and
to
continue
the
search
for
the
missing
gun
and
silencer
looked
on
with
unconcealed
amusement
as
dundee
tapped
walls
floors
and
ceilings
in
a
house
that
seemed
to
be
exceptionally
free
of
architectural
eccentricities
finally
dundee
grew
tired
of
their
ribald
comments
and
curtly
ordered
them
to
make
a
new
and
exhaustive
search
of
the
unused
portions
of
the
basement
those
dark
earth
banks
with
their
overhead
networks
of
water
and
drain
pipes
heavily
insulated
cables
of
electric
wires
cobwebby
rafters
and
rough
shelves
holding
empty
fruit
jars
and
liquor
bottles
which
contrasted
sharply
with
the
neatly
ceiled
and
space
devoted
to
furnace
laundry
and
maid
room
dundee
himself
had
given
those
regions
only
a
cursory
inspection
with
his
flashlight
for
it
was
highly
improbable
that
nita
selim
would
have
made
use
of
a
secret
hiding
place
for
her
jewelry
and
valuable
papers
if
that
hiding
place
was
located
in
such
dark
awesome
surroundings
no
the
hiding
place
if
it
really
existed
and
it
must
exist
had
been
within
easy
reach
of
nita
dressing
and
bedecking
herself
for
a
party
or
lydia
carr
could
not
have
been
kept
in
complete
ignorance
of
its
location
with
that
conviction
in
mind
dundee
returned
to
nita
bedroom
to
which
he
had
already
devoted
at
least
half
an
hour
nothing
in
the
big
clothes
closet
where
flora
miles
had
been
hiding
while
nita
was
being
murdered
no
secret
drawers
in
desk
or
or
bedside
table
no
false
bottom
in
boudoir
chair
or
chaise
longue
he
had
even
taken
every
book
out
of
the
bookcase
which
stood
against
the
west
wall
near
the
north
corner
of
the
room
and
had
satisfied
himself
that
no
book
was
a
leafless
fake
his
minute
inspection
of
the
bathroom
and
back
hall
upon
which
bedroom
opened
had
proved
as
fruitless
although
he
had
removed
every
drawer
from
the
big
linen
press
which
stood
in
the
hall
and
measured
spaces
to
a
fraction
of
an
inch
as
for
the
walls
they
were
except
for
the
doors
unbroken
expanses
of
tinted
plaster
and
yet
he
stepped
into
the
clothes
closet
again
hammer
in
hand
for
a
fresh
tapping
of
the
walls
nothing
here
and
then
he
tapped
again
his
ear
against
the
end
wall
of
the
closet
the
wall
farthest
from
the
side
porch
yes
there
was
a
faintly
hollow
echo
of
the
hammer
strokes
excitement
blazing
high
again
he
took
the
tape
measure
with
which
he
had
provided
himself
on
his
way
out
and
calculated
the
length
of
the
closet
from
end
to
end
six
feet
emerging
from
the
closet
he
closed
his
eyes
in
an
effort
to
recall
in
exact
detail
the
architect
blueprint
of
the
lower
floor
which
coroner
price
had
submitted
to
his
jury
at
the
inquest
that
morning
yes
that
was
right
the
inner
end
wall
of
nita
clothes
closet
was
also
the
back
of
the
guest
closet
in
the
little
foyer
that
lay
between
nita
bedroom
and
the
main
hall
within
ten
minutes
much
of
the
tape
measure
had
produced
a
startling
result
instead
of
having
a
wall
in
common
the
guest
closet
and
nita
clothes
closet
were
separated
by
exactly
eleven
inches
why
the
waste
space
the
blueprint
bearing
the
imprint
of
the
architects
hammond
hammond
showed
no
such
cubbyhole
exultantly
dundee
again
entered
nita
closet
and
went
over
every
inch
of
the
narrow
horizontal
cedar
boards
which
formed
the
end
wall
but
he
met
with
no
reward
not
through
this
workmanlike
solidly
constructed
wall
had
an
opening
been
made
but
in
the
foyer
closet
he
read
a
different
story
its
back
wall
had
an
amateurish
look
this
closet
was
not
as
was
nita
but
was
painted
throughout
in
soft
ivory
but
it
was
the
back
wall
of
the
closet
in
which
dundee
was
interested
unlike
the
other
walls
which
were
of
plaster
the
back
was
constructed
of
boards
the
cheapness
of
the
lumber
not
concealed
by
its
coat
of
ivory
paint
no
builder
had
put
in
that
wall
of
broad
horizontal
boards
and
then
directly
beneath
the
shelf
which
was
set
regulation
height
just
above
the
pole
on
which
swung
a
dozen
coat
hangers
dundee
found
what
he
was
looking
for
a
short
length
of
the
cheap
board
a
queer
scrap
to
have
been
used
even
in
so
shoddy
a
job
as
that
wall
was
eight
inches
long
and
set
square
in
the
center
of
the
wall
just
below
the
shelf
and
pole
if
he
had
not
been
looking
for
something
odd
however
dundee
acknowledged
to
himself
he
would
not
have
noticed
it
did
anyone
ever
notice
the
back
walls
of
closets
sure
of
the
result
he
pressed
with
his
finger
tips
upon
the
lower
end
of
that
short
piece
of
board
and
slowly
it
swung
inward
the
top
slanting
outward
had
found
the
secret
hiding
and
dundee
silently
agreed
with
judge
marshall
that
it
was
the
simplest
and
most
ingenious
arrangement
you
ever
saw
for
it
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
shelf
set
between
the
two
closets
in
those
eleven
inches
of
unaccounted
for
space
i
take
off
my
hat
to
roger
crain
dundee
reflected
no
burglar
in
the
world
would
ever
have
thought
of
pressing
upon
a
short
piece
of
board
in
a
foyer
closet
in
search
of
a
safe
but
how
did
judge
marshall
know
of
its
existence
the
only
answer
dundee
could
think
of
was
that
crain
overseeing
the
building
of
his
house
had
suddenly
conceived
this
brilliant
and
simple
plan
and
had
tipped
one
of
the
carpenters
to
carry
it
out
for
him
possibly
or
probably
he
had
bragged
to
clive
or
ralph
hammond
his
architects
of
his
clever
invention
and
the
hammond
boys
had
passed
on
the
information
to
judge
marshall
when
after
crain
failure
and
flight
the
house
had
become
the
property
of
the
these
thoughts
rushed
through
his
mind
as
his
flashlight
explored
the
shelf
through
the
tilted
opening
the
gun
and
silencer
be
here
since
they
could
be
no
place
else
but
the
shelf
was
bare
except
for
a
small
brass
box
fastened
only
by
a
clasp
in
his
acute
disappointment
dundee
took
little
interest
in
the
collection
of
pretty
but
inexpensive
jewelry
nita
trinkets
undoubtedly
which
the
brass
box
contained
no
wedding
ring
among
them
in
spite
of
his
chagrin
at
not
finding
the
gun
dundee
studied
the
simple
mechanism
which
roger
crain
ingenuity
had
conceived
from
the
outside
the
length
of
board
fitted
smoothly
giving
no
indication
whatever
that
it
was
otherwise
than
what
it
seemed
part
of
a
cheaply
built
wall
but
dundee
flashlight
played
upon
the
beveled
edges
of
both
the
short
board
and
the
two
neighboring
planks
between
which
it
was
fitted
the
pivoting
arrangement
was
of
the
simplest
the
small
pieces
being
set
into
the
short
board
and
the
other
two
planks
with
small
screws
which
did
not
pierce
the
painted
outside
surface
his
curiosity
satisfied
dundee
stepped
out
of
the
closet
into
the
tiny
foyer
he
was
about
to
leave
when
a
terrific
truth
crashed
through
his
mind
and
froze
his
feet
to
the
floor
course
the
gun
and
silencer
were
not
there
this
was
the
in
it
had
hung
the
hat
of
every
person
who
had
been
nita
guest
either
for
bridge
or
cocktails
that
fatal
saturday
afternoon
to
this
closet
to
retrieve
hat
stick
or
in
the
case
of
the
women
summer
coat
and
hat
had
come
every
person
who
had
been
questioned
and
then
searched
by
the
dundee
tried
to
recapture
the
picture
of
the
stampede
which
had
followed
upon
his
permission
for
all
guests
to
go
to
their
homes
but
it
was
useless
he
had
stayed
in
the
living
room
with
strawn
had
taken
not
the
slightest
interest
in
the
scramble
for
hats
coats
and
sticks
for
strawn
had
previously
assured
him
that
the
guest
closet
had
been
thoroughly
searched
so
quickly
that
he
felt
slightly
dizzy
dundee
thoughts
raced
around
the
new
discovery
this
changed
everything
of
course
any
one
of
half
a
dozen
persons
could
have
arrived
with
the
gun
and
silencer
not
screwed
together
of
course
because
of
the
ungainly
length
and
seized
the
opportunity
presented
by
nita
being
alone
in
her
bedroom
to
shoot
her
what
easier
then
than
to
hide
the
weapon
on
this
secret
shelf
the
door
of
which
yielded
to
the
slightest
pressure
and
what
easier
than
to
retrieve
the
weapon
after
permission
had
been
granted
to
all
to
return
to
their
homes
easy
enough
to
manage
to
go
alone
to
the
closet
for
a
hat
the
extra
minute
of
time
unnoticed
in
the
general
excitement
it
had
been
vitally
necessary
too
to
retrieve
the
weapon
since
any
innocent
member
of
that
party
might
have
remembered
later
to
mention
the
secret
hiding
place
to
the
police
secret
no
longer
since
judge
marshall
had
gossiped
about
it
then
another
thought
boiled
up
and
demanded
attention
in
the
new
theory
what
place
did
the
bang
or
bump
have
that
noise
which
flora
miles
concealed
in
nita
closet
had
dimly
heard
dundee
had
been
positive
when
lydia
had
discovered
the
shattered
electric
bulb
in
the
big
bronze
lamp
that
its
position
in
nita
room
indicated
the
progress
of
the
flight
of
the
murderer
flight
diagonally
across
the
room
toward
the
back
hall
but
now
a
little
dashed
dundee
returned
to
the
bedroom
the
big
lamp
was
where
he
had
first
seen
it
about
a
foot
beyond
the
window
nearest
the
porch
and
at
the
head
of
the
chaise
longue
which
was
set
between
the
two
west
windows
where
according
to
lydia
the
lamp
always
stood
the
cord
lay
slackly
along
the
floor
near
the
west
wall
and
extended
to
the
double
outlet
on
the
baseboard
behind
the
bookcase
slack
cord
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
dundee
went
to
peer
under
the
low
bottom
shelf
of
the
bookcase
yes
the
pronged
plug
of
the
lamp
cord
had
been
jerked
almost
out
of
the
baseboard
outlet
it
was
easy
to
visualize
what
had
happened
the
murderer
after
firing
the
shot
had
involuntarily
taken
a
step
or
even
several
steps
backward
until
his
foot
had
caught
in
the
loop
of
electric
cord
causing
the
big
lamp
to
be
thrown
violently
against
the
wall
near
which
it
stood
but
who
one
of
half
a
dozen
people
but
chapter
nineteen
having
ticketed
the
big
bronze
lamp
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
the
selim
house
and
locked
it
away
in
the
room
devoted
to
exhibits
for
the
state
bonnie
dundee
hurried
into
penny
office
primed
with
the
news
of
his
discovery
of
the
secret
hiding
place
and
eager
to
lay
his
new
theory
before
the
district
attorney
bill
gone
penny
interrupted
her
swift
typing
to
inform
him
to
chicago
he
had
only
fifteen
minutes
to
make
the
three
train
after
he
received
a
wire
saying
his
mother
is
not
expected
to
live
he
tried
to
reach
you
at
the
selim
house
but
one
of
captain
strawn
men
said
you
had
left
i
stopped
on
my
way
in
to
get
a
bite
to
eat
dundee
explained
mechanically
i
dashed
off
without
my
lunch
you
know
did
you
find
the
gun
and
silencer
penny
asked
no
whoever
used
it
saturday
afternoon
walked
out
of
the
house
with
it
in
plain
view
of
the
police
and
still
has
it
very
convenient
too
in
case
another
murder
seems
to
be
expedient
or
amusing
do
joke
penny
shuddered
but
what
in
the
world
do
you
mean
briefly
dundee
told
her
minimizing
the
hard
work
the
concentrated
thinking
and
the
meticulous
use
of
a
tape
measure
which
had
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
the
shelf
between
nita
bedroom
closet
and
the
guest
closet
in
the
little
foyer
i
see
penny
agreed
her
husky
voice
slow
and
weighted
with
horror
she
sat
in
dazed
thought
for
a
minute
that
rather
brings
it
home
to
my
crowd
does
it
to
think
that
dad
probably
everyone
at
the
party
except
me
had
heard
all
about
dad
and
arrangement
for
hiding
the
securities
he
sent
on
to
new
york
before
he
ran
away
and
no
outsiders
nobody
but
had
a
legitimate
excuse
for
entering
that
closet
not
even
dexter
sprague
it
one
of
his
affectations
not
to
wear
a
hat
is
it
dundee
pounced
you
sure
he
wore
no
hat
that
afternoon
did
you
notice
him
when
he
left
after
i
had
dismissed
you
all
yes
penny
acknowledged
honestly
i
paid
attention
to
him
because
i
was
hating
him
so
i
believed
then
that
he
was
the
murderer
and
i
was
furious
with
you
and
captain
strawn
for
not
arresting
him
he
was
the
first
to
leave
just
walked
straight
out
would
even
stop
to
talk
with
janet
raymond
who
was
trying
to
get
a
word
with
him
i
saw
him
start
toward
sheridan
road
walking
he
had
no
car
you
know
did
you
observe
the
others
dundee
demanded
eagerly
do
you
know
who
went
to
the
guest
closet
penny
shook
her
head
everybody
was
milling
around
in
the
hall
and
i
paid
no
attention
lois
said
she
would
drive
me
home
and
then
i
went
in
to
ask
you
to
let
me
stay
behind
with
you
i
remember
listen
penny
i
going
to
tell
you
something
else
that
nobody
knows
yet
but
sanderson
lydia
and
me
i
do
have
to
ask
you
not
to
tell
any
of
your
friends
you
know
well
enough
that
anything
you
learn
from
either
sanderson
or
me
is
strictly
confidential
penny
nodded
her
face
very
white
and
her
brown
eyes
big
with
misery
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
nita
selim
was
a
blackmailer
that
she
came
to
hamilton
for
the
express
purpose
of
bleeding
someone
she
had
known
before
or
someone
on
whom
she
had
goods
from
some
underworld
source
or
other
at
any
rate
nita
banked
ten
thousand
mysterious
dollars
on
april
and
on
may
i
talked
to
drake
last
night
and
i
have
his
word
for
it
that
the
money
was
in
bills
of
varying
denomination
none
large
when
nita
presented
it
for
deposit
therefore
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
nita
got
the
money
right
here
in
hamilton
otherwise
it
would
have
come
to
her
in
the
form
of
checks
or
drafts
or
money
orders
and
it
seems
equally
clear
to
me
that
she
did
not
bring
that
large
amount
of
cash
from
new
york
with
her
or
she
would
have
deposited
it
in
a
lump
sum
in
the
bank
immediately
after
her
arrival
yes
penny
agreed
but
why
are
you
telling
of
course
interested
because
i
want
you
to
tell
me
the
financial
status
of
each
of
your
friends
dundee
said
gently
i
know
how
hard
it
is
for
you
you
could
find
out
from
others
so
i
might
as
well
tell
you
penny
interrupted
with
a
weary
shrug
judge
marshall
is
and
karen
father
her
mother
is
dead
settled
on
her
when
she
married
she
has
complete
control
of
her
own
money
the
dunlaps
are
the
richest
people
in
hamilton
and
have
been
for
two
or
three
generations
lois
was
but
poor
when
she
married
peter
but
he
been
giving
her
an
allowance
of
a
year
for
several
years
not
for
running
the
house
but
for
her
personal
use
clothes
charities
hobbies
like
the
little
theater
she
brought
nita
here
to
organize
i
would
say
she
spends
a
great
deal
of
it
on
dress
dundee
interrupted
with
a
grin
lois
does
give
a
hang
how
she
looks
or
what
anyone
thinks
of
her
which
is
probably
one
reason
she
is
the
woman
in
our
crowd
penny
retorted
loyally
the
miles
money
is
really
flora
and
she
has
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
shrewdest
business
in
town
when
she
married
tracey
nearly
eight
years
ago
he
was
just
a
salesman
in
her
father
business
the
biggest
dairy
in
the
state
butter
cream
milk
and
cheese
you
know
well
when
flora
married
tracey
her
father
retired
and
let
tracey
run
the
business
for
flora
and
he
still
managing
it
but
flora
is
the
real
head
now
let
see
oh
yes
the
drakes
johnny
is
vice
president
of
the
hamilton
national
bank
as
you
know
and
owns
a
big
block
of
the
stock
carolyn
has
no
money
of
her
own
except
what
johnny
gives
her
and
i
rather
think
he
is
any
too
generous
they
do
get
along
very
well
together
do
they
penny
agreed
reluctantly
you
see
johnny
drake
was
simply
not
cut
out
for
love
and
marriage
he
a
born
ascetic
would
have
been
a
monk
two
or
three
centuries
ago
but
he
cares
as
much
for
carolyn
as
he
could
for
any
woman
the
hammond
boys
have
some
inherited
money
and
clive
has
made
a
big
financial
success
of
architecture
that
leaves
only
janet
and
polly
does
it
polly
an
orphan
and
has
barrels
of
money
and
will
have
barrels
more
when
her
aunt
with
whom
she
lives
dies
and
leaves
her
the
fortune
she
has
always
promised
her
and
janet
raymond
janet
father
is
pretty
rich
owns
a
big
factory
but
janet
has
only
a
reasonable
allowance
penny
answered
as
for
me
i
rich
i
get
whole
dollars
a
week
to
support
myself
and
mother
on
dundee
remained
thoughtfully
silent
for
a
long
minute
then
all
you
girls
are
alumnae
of
and
nita
selim
came
here
immediately
after
she
had
directed
a
forsyte
play
tell
me
penny
was
any
of
the
hamilton
girls
ever
in
disgrace
while
in
the
forsyte
school
penny
face
flamed
i
sorry
to
disappoint
you
but
so
far
as
i
know
there
was
never
anything
of
the
sort
of
course
we
all
graduated
different
years
except
karen
and
i
and
i
might
not
have
heard
but
no
she
denied
vehemently
there
was
any
scandal
on
a
hamilton
girl
ever
i
sure
of
it
but
her
very
vehemence
convinced
bonnie
dundee
that
she
was
not
at
all
sure
he
looked
at
his
watch
four
by
this
time
nita
selim
tiny
cold
body
royal
blue
velvet
dress
black
curls
piled
high
in
an
french
roll
heart
were
nothing
more
than
a
little
heap
of
grey
ashes
would
lydia
carr
have
them
put
in
a
sealed
urn
and
carry
them
about
with
her
always
i
going
out
now
penny
and
i
sha
be
back
today
he
told
the
girl
who
had
returned
to
her
furious
typing
i
telephone
in
about
an
hour
to
see
if
anything
has
come
up
by
the
way
how
do
i
get
to
the
dunlap
house
it
in
the
brentwood
section
you
know
that
cluster
of
hills
around
mirror
lake
most
of
the
crowd
live
out
there
the
drakes
the
mileses
the
beales
the
marshalls
the
dunlap
house
stands
on
the
highest
hill
of
all
it
grey
stone
a
little
like
a
french
chateau
we
used
to
live
out
there
too
in
a
colonial
house
my
mother
father
built
but
dad
persuaded
mother
to
sell
when
he
went
into
that
primrose
meadows
venture
the
raymonds
bought
it
but
why
do
you
want
to
see
lois
thanks
much
penny
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
you
dundee
said
without
answering
her
question
and
reached
for
his
hat
after
ten
minutes
of
driving
the
last
mile
of
which
had
circled
a
smooth
silver
coin
of
a
lake
dundee
stopped
his
car
and
let
his
eyes
rove
appreciatively
he
had
made
this
trip
the
day
before
to
question
lydia
already
installed
as
nurse
for
the
miles
children
but
he
had
been
in
too
great
a
hurry
then
to
see
much
of
this
section
consecrated
to
hamilton
socially
elect
georgian
cottage
spanish
hacienda
italian
villa
tudor
mansion
that
was
the
miles
home
colonial
mansion
where
penny
had
once
lived
grey
stone
chateau
not
one
of
them
blatantly
new
or
marked
with
the
dollar
sign
dundee
sighed
a
little
enviously
as
he
turned
his
car
into
the
winding
driveway
that
led
up
the
highest
hill
to
the
dunlap
home
lois
dunlap
betrayed
no
surprise
when
the
butler
led
dundee
to
the
upper
terrace
overlooking
mirror
lake
where
she
was
having
tea
with
her
three
children
and
their
governess
for
a
moment
the
detective
had
the
illusion
that
he
was
in
england
again
how
do
you
do
mr
dundee
this
is
miss
burden
my
three
offspring
peter
the
third
eleanor
and
bobby
will
you
please
take
the
children
to
the
playroom
now
miss
burden
thank
you
tea
dundee
or
shall
i
order
you
a
highball
nothing
thanks
dundee
answered
grateful
for
her
friendliness
but
nonplussed
by
it
not
for
the
first
time
he
felt
a
sick
distaste
for
the
profession
he
had
chosen
it
all
over
lois
dunlap
said
in
a
low
voice
as
the
butler
retreated
lydia
made
her
look
very
beautiful
i
thought
it
would
be
rather
horrible
having
to
see
her
as
the
poor
child
requested
in
her
note
to
lydia
but
i
glad
now
i
did
she
looked
as
sweet
and
young
and
innocent
as
she
must
have
been
when
she
first
wore
the
royal
blue
velvet
i
glad
dundee
said
sincerely
then
he
leaned
toward
her
across
the
tea
table
dunlap
will
you
please
tell
me
just
how
you
persuaded
selim
to
come
to
hamilton
so
far
from
broadway
why
certainly
lois
dunlap
looked
puzzled
but
it
really
did
not
take
much
persuasion
after
i
showed
her
some
group
photographs
we
had
made
when
we
forsyte
girls
put
on
beggar
opera
here
last
october
a
benefit
performance
for
the
forsyte
alumnae
scholarship
fund
with
difficulty
dundee
controlled
his
excitement
may
i
see
those
photographs
please
i
had
to
hunt
quite
a
bit
for
them
his
hostess
apologized
ten
minutes
later
as
she
spread
the
glossy
prints
of
half
a
dozen
photographs
for
dundee
inspection
do
you
know
beggar
opera
john
gay
eighteenth
century
is
it
as
i
remember
it
it
is
quite
and
dundee
hesitated
grinning
bawdy
lois
laughed
oh
very
we
could
have
got
away
with
it
if
it
had
been
a
classic
as
it
was
we
had
to
tone
down
some
of
the
naughtiest
passages
and
songs
but
it
was
lots
of
fun
and
the
boys
enjoyed
it
hugely
because
it
gave
them
an
opportunity
to
wear
tight
satin
breeches
and
lace
ruffles
this
is
my
husband
peter
he
adored
being
the
highwayman
of
bagshot
and
she
pointed
out
a
stocky
man
near
the
end
of
the
long
row
of
costumed
players
in
a
photograph
which
showed
the
entire
cast
you
say
that
selim
accepted
your
proposal
she
saw
these
photographs
dundee
asked
had
she
refused
before
yes
i
gone
to
new
york
for
the
annual
easter
play
which
the
forsyte
school
puts
on
because
i
intensely
interested
in
theatricals
lois
explained
nita
had
done
a
splendid
job
with
the
play
the
year
before
and
i
spoke
to
her
after
this
year
show
was
over
about
coming
to
hamilton
she
was
not
at
all
interested
but
polite
and
sweet
about
it
so
i
invited
her
to
have
lunch
with
me
the
next
day
and
showed
her
these
photographs
of
our
own
play
in
the
hope
that
they
would
make
her
take
the
idea
more
seriously
we
had
borrowed
a
little
theater
director
from
chicago
and
i
knew
we
had
done
a
really
good
job
of
beggar
opera
the
local
reviews
these
look
extremely
professional
i
do
wonder
that
they
interested
nita
dundee
cut
in
will
you
tell
me
what
she
said
she
rather
startled
me
lois
dunlap
confessed
i
first
showed
her
this
picture
of
the
whole
cast
and
as
i
was
explaining
the
play
a
bit
she
did
know
beggar
opera
she
almost
snatched
the
photograph
out
of
my
hands
as
she
studied
it
her
lovely
black
eyes
grew
perfectly
enormous
i
never
seen
her
so
excited
since
what
did
she
say
dundee
interrupted
tensely
why
she
said
nothing
just
at
first
then
she
began
to
laugh
in
the
queerest
way
almost
hysterically
i
asked
her
why
she
was
laughing
i
was
a
little
huffy
i
afraid
and
she
said
the
men
looked
so
adorably
conceited
and
funny
then
she
began
to
ask
the
names
of
the
players
i
told
her
that
he
the
highwayman
hero
you
know
was
played
by
clive
hammond
that
my
peter
was
of
bagshot
that
johnny
drake
was
another
highwayman
of
the
mint
that
tracey
miles
played
the
jailor
did
she
show
more
interest
in
one
name
than
another
yes
when
i
pointed
out
judge
marshall
as
the
fence
she
cried
out
suddenly
i
know
him
i
met
him
once
on
a
party
is
he
really
a
and
she
laughed
as
if
she
knew
something
very
funny
about
hugo
as
no
doubt
she
did
he
was
an
inveterate
before
his
marriage
as
you
may
have
heard
do
you
think
her
first
excitement
was
over
seeing
judge
marshall
among
the
players
dundee
asked
no
lois
answered
after
considering
a
moment
i
sure
she
notice
him
until
i
pointed
him
out
the
face
in
this
group
that
seemed
to
interest
her
most
was
flora
miles
flora
played
the
part
of
lockit
the
jailor
daughter
and
karen
marshall
the
other
feminine
lead
peachum
you
know
but
it
was
flora
picture
she
lingered
over
so
i
showed
her
this
picture
and
lois
dunlap
reached
for
the
portrait
of
flora
miles
unexpectedly
beautiful
in
the
eighteenth
century
costume
tight
bodice
and
billowing
skirts
she
questioned
you
about
mrs
miles
dundee
asked
yes
all
sorts
of
questions
her
name
and
whether
she
was
married
and
then
who
her
husband
was
and
if
she
had
had
stage
experience
lois
answered
conscientiously
she
explained
her
interest
by
saying
flora
looked
more
like
a
professional
actress
than
any
of
the
others
and
that
we
should
give
her
a
real
chance
when
we
got
our
little
theater
going
i
asked
her
if
that
meant
she
was
going
to
accept
my
offer
and
she
said
she
might
but
that
she
would
have
to
talk
it
over
with
a
friend
first
just
before
midnight
she
telephoned
me
at
my
hotel
that
she
had
decided
to
accept
the
job
dundee
heart
leaped
it
was
very
easy
to
guess
who
that
friend
was
but
he
controlled
his
excitement
asked
his
next
question
casually
did
she
show
particular
interest
in
any
other
player
yes
she
asked
a
number
of
questions
about
polly
beale
and
seemed
incredulous
when
i
told
her
that
polly
and
clive
were
engaged
polly
played
peachum
and
was
a
riot
in
the
part
but
intuition
was
correct
flora
carried
off
the
acting
honors
oh
yes
she
also
asked
quite
naïvely
if
all
my
friends
were
rich
too
and
could
help
support
a
little
theater
i
reassured
her
on
that
point
and
dundee
reflected
silently
upon
a
point
much
more
important
to
nita
selim
aloud
he
said
i
do
see
among
the
cast
oh
i
have
a
grain
of
talent
lois
dunlap
laughed
i
ca
act
for
two
cents
can
i
peter
darling
here
the
redoubtable
of
bagshot
in
person
dundee
my
husband
the
detective
rose
to
shake
hands
with
the
man
he
had
been
too
absorbed
to
see
or
hear
approaching
you
the
man
from
the
district
attorney
office
peter
dunlap
scowled
his
hand
barely
touching
dundee
i
suppose
you
trying
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
the
mystery
of
why
my
wife
brought
that
selim
woman
do
call
her
selim
woman
peter
lois
dunlap
interrupted
with
more
sharpness
than
dundee
had
ever
seen
her
display
you
never
liked
the
poor
girl
were
never
just
to
her
well
it
looks
as
if
my
hunch
was
correct
does
it
the
stocky
man
retorted
i
told
you
at
the
beginning
to
pay
her
off
and
send
her
back
to
new
york
you
knew
i
could
do
that
even
to
please
you
dear
lois
said
but
please
do
let
quarrel
about
poor
nita
again
she
dead
now
and
i
want
to
do
anything
i
can
to
help
bring
her
murderer
to
justice
there
nothing
you
can
do
lois
and
i
hope
ah
dundee
will
not
find
it
necessary
to
quiz
you
again
dundee
reached
for
his
hat
i
hope
so
too
dunlap
by
the
way
you
are
president
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
are
you
yes
i
am
and
we
having
a
meeting
tonight
at
which
that
sprague
man
bid
on
making
a
historical
movie
of
hamilton
will
be
turned
down
unanimously
now
that
the
selim
woman
is
here
to
vamp
my
into
doing
anything
she
wants
i
think
i
can
safely
promise
you
that
dexter
sprague
will
have
no
further
business
in
hamilton
unless
it
is
police
business
thanks
for
the
tip
dunlap
dundee
said
evenly
i
hope
you
enjoyed
your
fishing
trip
where
do
you
fish
sir
a
tactful
way
of
asking
for
my
alibi
eh
dunlap
was
heavily
sarcastic
i
left
friday
afternoon
for
my
own
camp
in
the
mountains
up
in
the
northwest
part
of
the
state
i
drove
my
own
car
went
alone
spent
the
alone
and
got
back
this
noon
i
read
of
the
murder
in
a
paper
i
picked
up
in
a
village
on
my
way
home
i
did
like
nita
selim
and
i
do
give
a
damn
about
her
being
murdered
except
that
my
wife
name
is
in
all
the
papers
any
questions
none
thanks
dundee
answered
curtly
then
turned
to
lois
dunlap
who
was
watching
the
two
men
with
troubled
embarrassed
eyes
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
dunlap
for
your
kindness
the
detective
angry
resentment
of
peter
dunlap
attitude
lasted
until
he
had
circled
mirror
lake
and
was
on
the
road
into
hamilton
then
commonsense
intervened
dunlap
was
undoubtedly
devoted
to
his
wife
penny
had
said
that
he
had
never
looked
at
another
woman
it
was
rather
more
than
natural
that
he
should
be
in
a
futile
blustering
rage
at
the
outcome
of
lois
friendship
for
the
little
broadway
dancer
free
of
anger
his
mind
reverted
to
the
story
lois
dunlap
had
told
him
for
in
it
he
was
sure
was
hidden
the
key
to
the
mystery
of
nita
selim
murder
not
at
all
interested
in
the
proposition
to
organize
a
little
theater
in
hamilton
nita
had
been
seized
with
a
strange
excitement
as
soon
as
she
was
shown
photographs
of
a
large
group
of
hamilton
richest
and
most
prominent
inhabitants
but
there
was
the
rub
large
group
would
that
group
of
possible
suspects
never
narrow
down
to
one
of
course
there
was
judge
marshall
but
if
lois
memory
was
to
be
trusted
nita
had
not
noticed
the
elderly
beau
picture
until
that
strange
hysterical
excitement
had
taken
possession
of
her
and
if
it
had
been
judge
marshall
whom
she
had
come
to
hamilton
to
blackmail
would
nita
not
have
guarded
her
tongue
before
lois
the
same
was
true
about
her
extraordinary
interest
in
flora
miles
dundee
tried
to
put
himself
in
nita
place
confronted
suddenly
with
a
group
picture
containing
the
likeness
of
a
person
man
or
woman
against
whom
she
knew
something
so
dreadful
and
so
secret
that
her
silence
would
be
worth
thousands
of
dollars
would
have
chattered
of
that
very
person
no
of
anyone
else
but
that
particular
person
it
was
easy
to
picture
nita
her
head
whirling
with
possibilities
hitting
upon
the
most
conspicuous
player
in
the
group
dark
tense
theatrical
flora
already
pointed
out
to
her
as
one
of
the
two
female
leads
in
the
opera
but
of
whom
had
she
really
been
thinking
again
a
blank
wall
for
in
that
group
photograph
of
the
cast
of
the
beggar
opera
had
appeared
every
man
woman
and
girl
who
had
been
nita
guest
on
the
day
of
her
murder
dundee
paying
more
attention
to
his
driving
now
that
he
was
in
the
business
section
of
the
city
saw
ahead
of
him
the
hotel
where
dexter
sprague
had
been
living
since
nita
had
wired
him
to
join
her
in
hamilton
on
a
sudden
impulse
the
detective
parked
his
car
in
front
of
the
hotel
and
five
minutes
later
was
knocking
upon
door
well
what
do
you
want
now
the
unshaven
pallid
man
demanded
ungraciously
dundee
stepped
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
i
want
you
to
tell
me
the
name
of
the
man
nita
selim
came
here
to
blackmail
sprague
blackmail
sprague
echoed
his
pallid
cheeks
going
more
yellow
you
crazy
nita
came
here
to
take
a
job
she
came
here
to
blackmail
someone
and
i
am
convinced
that
she
sent
for
you
to
act
as
a
partner
in
her
scheme
no
wait
i
i
tell
you
dundee
assured
him
grimly
but
i
make
a
trade
with
you
in
behalf
of
the
district
attorney
tell
me
the
name
of
the
person
she
blackmailed
and
i
will
promise
you
immunity
from
prosecution
as
her
accomplice
get
out
of
my
room
and
dexter
sprague
right
forefinger
trembled
violently
as
it
pointed
toward
the
door
in
a
melodramatic
gesture
very
well
sprague
dundee
said
but
let
me
give
you
a
friendly
warning
try
to
carry
on
the
good
nita
got
ten
thousand
dollars
but
she
also
got
a
bullet
through
her
heart
and
the
gun
which
fired
that
bullet
is
safely
back
in
the
hands
of
the
killer
not
going
to
get
that
movie
job
and
i
was
just
afraid
you
might
be
tempted
good
afternoon
chapter
twenty
it
was
wednesday
evening
four
whole
days
since
nita
leigh
selim
broadway
dancer
had
been
murdered
while
she
was
dummy
at
bridge
plainclothesmen
in
pairs
day
and
night
shifts
still
guarded
the
lonely
house
in
primrose
meadows
but
dundee
had
taken
no
interest
in
the
actual
scene
of
the
crime
since
carraway
fingerprint
expert
had
reported
negatively
upon
the
secret
shelf
between
nita
bedroom
closet
and
the
guest
closet
so
far
as
any
tangible
evidence
went
only
dundee
fingers
had
pressed
upon
the
pivoting
panel
and
explored
the
narrow
shelf
the
very
lack
of
fingerprints
had
of
course
confirmed
dundee
belief
that
the
murderer
hand
had
pressed
upon
that
swinging
panel
had
quested
in
vain
for
the
incriminating
documents
or
letters
which
had
been
the
basis
of
nita
blackmail
scheme
had
deposited
upon
the
shelf
the
gun
and
silencer
with
which
the
murder
had
been
accomplished
and
had
later
retrieved
the
weapon
in
perfect
safety
a
hand
loosely
wrapped
in
a
handkerchief
or
protected
by
a
glove
the
hand
of
a
cunning
careful
murderer
or
murderess
but
who
bonnie
dundee
brooding
at
his
desk
in
the
living
room
of
his
small
apartment
reflected
bitterly
that
he
was
no
nearer
the
answer
to
that
question
than
he
had
been
an
hour
after
nita
selim
death
well
dear
watson
he
addressed
his
caged
parrot
finally
what
do
you
say
who
killed
nita
selim
the
parrot
stirred
on
his
perch
thrust
out
his
hooked
beak
to
nip
his
master
prodding
finger
then
disdainfully
turned
his
back
i
do
blame
you
dundee
chuckled
you
must
be
as
sick
of
that
question
as
i
am
and
what
a
pity
it
ever
had
to
be
asked
if
the
murderer
had
not
been
so
hasty
or
so
pressed
for
time
that
he
really
could
not
wait
to
listen
to
nita
he
would
have
learned
from
nita
herself
that
she
had
decided
to
be
a
very
good
girl
and
had
burned
the
all
because
she
was
genuinely
in
love
with
ralph
hammond
one
comfort
we
have
dear
watson
the
murderer
still
does
not
know
that
nita
burned
the
papers
friday
night
sooner
or
later
when
he
believes
police
vigilance
has
been
relaxed
he
go
prowling
about
that
house
and
to
captain
strawn
who
does
take
the
slightest
stock
in
my
theory
will
go
credit
for
the
arrest
unless
dundee
reached
for
a
telegraph
form
and
again
scanned
the
pencilled
message
only
that
afternoon
had
it
occurred
to
him
to
ask
the
telegraph
company
for
a
copy
of
the
wire
by
which
dexter
sprague
according
to
his
own
story
had
been
summoned
to
hamilton
by
nita
selim
the
manager
had
been
obliging
had
looked
up
the
message
and
copied
it
with
his
own
hand
it
was
a
night
letter
and
had
been
filed
in
hamilton
april
the
third
day
after
nita
arrival
addressed
to
dexter
sprague
at
a
hotel
in
the
theatrical
district
new
york
city
the
message
read
everything
jake
so
far
but
would
feel
safer
you

why
not
try
for

as
good
excuse
all
my
love
nita
dundee
laid
the
paper
on
his
desk
locked
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
addressed
the
parrot
again
the
habit
of
using
the
bird
for
an
audience
and
as
an
excuse
for
puzzling
and
mulling
aloud
had
grown
on
him
during
the
year
he
had
owned
the
doughty
old
as
i
was
about
to
say
dear
watson
captain
strawn
boys
out
at
the
selim
house
will
have
their
chance
to
nab
our
man
or
woman
unless
dexter
sprague
ignores
my
warning
pretends
to
have
the
papers
himself
and
tries
to
carry
on
the
blackmail
scheme
which
he
undoubtedly
knew
all
about
and
which
most
probably
he
encouraged
nita
to
undertake
the
she
had
to
consult
you
know
before
she
decided
to
accept
lois
dunlap
offer
the
parrot
interrupted
with
a
hoarse
cackle
have
you
gone
over
to
the
enemy
dundee
reproved
the
bird
you
sound
exactly
like
strawn
when
he
laughed
at
my
interpretation
of
this
message
this
afternoon
my
late
chief
contends
and
it
is
just
possible
of
course
that
he
is
right
that
nita
was
afraid
she
could
swing
the
job
of
organizing
and
directing
lois
little
theater
and
wanted
sprague
here
both
as
lover
and
unofficial
assistant
but
that
a
pretty
thin
explanation
do
you
think
dear
watson
oh
all
right
laugh
damn
you
but
i
feel
better
if
strawn
had
taken
my
advice
and
set
a
dick
to
trail
sprague
to
see
that
he
keeps
out
of
mischief
all
this
however
gets
us
no
nearer

answering
that
eternal
question

which
was

efficient

had

when
he
had
telephoned
to
the
office
just
before
five
monday
afternoon
to
see
if
anything
had
come
up
dundee
had
learned
from
penny
that
peter
dunlap
had
issued
an
informal
call
to
the
crowd
for
a
meeting
at
his
home
that
evening
you
going
of
course
dundee
had
asked
then
during
the
discussion
of
the
case
i
wish
you
try
to
get
the
answers
to
some
questions
which
need
clearing
up
if
you
can
do
so
without
getting
yourself
dutch
with
your
friends
fine
got
a
pencil
here
goes
and
now
he
was
the
report
she
had
conscientiously
written
and
left
on
his
desk
tuesday
morning
peter
declaring
he
wanted
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
this
case
presided
almost
like
a
judge
on
the
bench
and
asked
nearly
every
question
you
wanted
the
answer
to
everyone
in
the
crowd
adores
gruff
old
peter
and
no
one
dreamed
of
resenting
his
barrage
of
questions
what
a
detective
would
make
first
janet
admitted
that
she
did
not
go
directly
to
the
front
porch
when
she
left
the
living
room
after
her
table
finished
the
last
rubber
went
first
to
the
hall
lavatory
to
comb
her
hair
and
renew
her
said
she
was
there
alone
about
five
minutes
then
went
to
the
front
porch
revised
her
story
after
tracey
had
said
he
did
not
see
her
on
the
porch
when
he
arrived
second
judge
marshall
said
he
glanced
into
the
living
room
when
he
arrived
saw
karen
carolyn
and
me
absorbed
in
our
game
and
went
on
down
the
hall
to
hang
up
his
hat
and
stick
proceeded
immediately
to
the
living
room
third
john
drake
told
peter
he
entered
the
front
hall
and
passed
on
to
the
lavatory
to
wash
up
felt
sticky
after
his
walk
from
the
country
club
hung
up
hat
in
the
guest
closet
went
to
living
room
within
three
minutes
after
reaching
the
house
fourth
polly
and
clive
told
peter
they
stayed
together
in
the
solarium
the
whole
time
stationed
at
a
front
window
watching
for
ralph
when
peter
asked
them
if
they
could
confirm
judge
marshall
story
and
johnny
drake
story
they
said
they
had
seen
them
both
arrive
but
had
paid
no
attention
to
them
after
they
were
in
the
house
it
occurred
to
peter
too
to
wonder
if
either
polly
or
clive
went
to
nita
room
to
warn
her
that
ralph
knew
about
sprague
having
slept
the
night
before
in
the
upstairs
bedroom
they
both
denied
emphatically
that
they
had
done
so
fifth
judge
marshall
the
pompous
old
darling
still
smarting
under
the
insinuations
you
made
about
him
and
nita
right
after
the
murder
volunteered
the
information
to
peter
that
nita
had
paid
her
rent
on
the
plea
that
she
was
short
of
funds
and
that
he
had
told
her
to
let
it
go
until
it
was
quite
convenient
sixth
the
word
was
not
mentioned
and
johnny
drake
because
of
professional
ethics
i
suppose
did
not
tell
about
nita
two
deposits
of
each
in
his
bank
seventh
the
secret
shelf
in
the
foyer
closet
was
not
mentioned
peter
verdict
after
he
got
through
with
us
was
that
only
sprague
could
have
done
it
using
the
gun
and
silencer
which
nita
herself
had
stolen
from
hugo
i
could
tell
him
that
you
are
convinced
that
lydia
alibi
for
him
is
a
genuine
one
for
apparently
lydia
has
told
either
flora
or
tracey
that
she
was
able
to
furnish
sprague
an
alibi
and
that
all
except
that
peter
asked
me
to
convey
to
you
his
apologies
for
his
rudeness
monday
afternoon
penelope
crain
with
a
deep
sigh
dundee
laid
penny
report
aside
and
that
does
seem
to
be
all
dear
watson
he
told
the
parrot
exactly
half
a
dozen
possible
suspects
and
not
an
atom
of
actual
evidence
against
one
of
them
except
that
judge
marshall
owned
the
gun

janet

every
single
one
of

a
possible
victim
of

since
the
girls
all
attended
the
forsyte
school
where
nita
directed
the
easter
play
for
two
years
and
since
the
men
make
several
trips
a
year
to
new
york
six
people
all
of
whom
probably
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
secret
shelf
six
people
who
knew
nita
was
in
her
bedroom
either
from
having
seen
her
go
or
from
hearing
her
powder
box
tinkling
its
damnable
tune
yes
penny
right
that
all
so
far
as
hamilton
is
concerned
if
sanderson
let
me
go
to
new
york
which
is
where
this
damned
business
started
resign
and
go
on
my
own
without
wasting
another
day
here
but
dundee
did
not
go
to
new
york
the
next
morning
he
was
far
too
busy
in

chapter
hello
penny
dundee
greeted
the
district
attorney
private
secretary
thursday
morning
at
five
minutes
after
nine
any
news
from
sanderson
yes
penny
crain
answered
listlessly
a
night
letter
he
says
his
mother
is
still
very
low
and
that
we
to
wire
him
at
the
good
samaritan
hospital
in
chicago
if
anything
turns
up
then
i
suppose
i
can
reach
him
there
by
long
distance
and
dundee
lifted
the
telephone
from
penny
desk
to
put
in
the
call
what
happened
penny
demanded
her
brown
eyes
wide
and
startled
and
hurry
it
up
will
you
please
dundee
urged
the
long
distance
operator
before
hanging
up
the
receiver
and
answering
penny
question
that
just
the
trouble
nothing
happened
and
nothing
is
very
likely
to
happen
here
i
determined
to
go
to
new
york
and
work
on
this
pesky
case
from
that
end
then
you
come
around
to
captain
strawn
theory
that
it
was
a
new
york
gunman
penny
asked
hopefully
not
by
a
jugful
but
what
the
matter
with
you
this
morning
young
woman
you
looking
less
like
a
new
penny
and
more
like
one
that
has
been
too
much
in
circulation
thanks
penny
retorted
sarcastically
then
she
grinned
wryly
you
are
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
up
too
late
last
night
bridge
at
the
mileses
dundee
ejaculated
incredulously
so
the
bridge
party
take
place
in
spite
of
the
society
editor
discreet
announcement
yesterday
that
to
the
tragic
death
of
selim
the
regular
of
the
forsyte
alumnae
association
will
not
be
held
this
evening
at
the
home
of
and
tracey
miles
as
scheduled
it
was
a
and
it
really
was
intended
to
be
a
party
penny
corrected
him
it
just
sort
of
happened
and
of
all
the
ghastly
evenings
tell
me
about
it
dundee
suggested
knowing
this
town
telephone
service
as
i
do
i
have
plenty
of
time
to
listen
and
you
do
know
how
i
am
for
inside
gossip
on
hamilton
upper
crust
idiot
penny
flung
at
him
scornfully
you
know
society
would
bore
you
to
death
but
i
do
think
you
would
have
been
exactly
bored
last
night
knowing
as
i
do
your
opinion
of
dexter
sprague
sprague
good
lord
was
he
there
this
does
promise
to
be
interesting
tell
me
all
give
me
time
penny
snapped
i
might
as
well
talk
since
almost
no
work
for
me
to
do
with
bill
away
ralph
called
me
up
last
night
at
dinner
time
and
asked
me
if
i
felt
equal
to
playing
bridge
again
he
said
that
he
clive
tracey
and
johnny
drake
had
lunched
together
yesterday
as
they
frequently
do
at
the
athletic
club
and
that
judge
marshall
who
had
been
lunching
at
another
table
with
his
friend
attorney
sampson
stopped
at
their
table
and
suggested
a
bridge
game
at
his
home
for
last
night
hugo
said
he
wanted
to
coax
karen
into
playing
again
so
she
would
get
over
her
hysterical
aversion
to
the
game
since
she
had
to
replay
that
awful
hand
you
see
penny
explained
parenthetically
hugo
is
a
regular
bridge
fiend
and
naturally
he
does
want
to
be
kept
out
of
his
game
brute
dundee
cried
disgustedly
why
could
he
give
the
poor
girl
a
few
days
more
that
what
i
thought
penny
acknowledged
but
did
get
an
inhibition
against
bridge
and
the
idea
rather
appealed
to
me
personally
the
last
few
days
have
been
particularly
cheerful
ones
so
i
told
ralph
i
be
glad
to
go
tracey
had
suggested
his
house
instead
of
hugo
because
betty
was
well
yesterday
and
flora
would
want
to
leave
her
for
a
whole
evening
well
ralph
and
i
are
you
going
to
marry
ralph
hammond
penny
dundee
interrupted
as
if
prompted
by
casual
interest
penny
pale
face
flushed
vividly
no
i
not
in
love
with
him
and
i
sure
he
realizes
i
not
and
wo
ask
me
again
but
i
to
say
yes
sunday
i
simply
could
let
you
walk
in
on
us
after
i
permitted
you
to
eavesdrop
while
he
was
talking
without
first
saying
the
one
thing
that
would
convince
him
that
i
believed
in
his
innocence
and
had
set
a
trap
for
him
i
see
dundee
acknowledged
soberly
but
his
blue
eyes
shone
with
sudden
joy
oh
there
long
distance
just
a
minute
darling
hello
hello
yes
this
is
dundee
oh
all
right
try
again
in
fifteen
minutes
will
you
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
explained
to
penny
sanderson
has
reached
the
hospital
yet
but
is
expected
soon
go
on
with
your
story
who
all
played
bridge
at
the
mileses
you
do
mean
to
say
dexter
sprague
was
invited
too
penny
face
was
still
a
brilliant
pink
as
she
answered
i
refuse
to
have
my
climax
spoiled
when
ralph
and
i
got
there
at
eight
we
found
that
peter
and
lois
had
dined
with
tracey
and
flora
and
that
they
were
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
bridge
as
a
relief
from
endless
discussions
of
the
murder
we
hardly
got
there
when
the
marshalls
came
poor
little
karen
not
suspecting
that
she
was
going
to
have
to
play
then
came
johnny
drake
alone
with
the
news
that
carolyn
was
in
bed
and
very
miserable
with
a
summer
cold
polly
walked
over
from
her
house
which
is
on
the
next
hill
to
the
right
you
know
she
said
clive
had
decided
to
work
late
at
the
office
and
had
promised
to
call
for
her
about
eleven
to
take
her
home
what
about
janet
raymond
was
she
left
out
dundee
asked
i
told
you
it
was
a
planned
affair
penny
reminded
him
but
flora
did
telephone
her
and
she
said
she
did
feel
like
coming
she
been
moping
about
like
a
sick
cat
since
nita
death
we
all
knew
she
was
idiotically
in
love
with
dexter
sprague
and
it
must
have
been
an
awful
blow
to
her
to
hear
you
read
aloud
that
note
nita
received
from
sprague
so
i
noticed
dundee
nodded
recalling
the
deathly
pallor
of
the
girl
face
as
sprague
had
glibly
explained
away
that
damning
note
and
all
its
implications
well
penny
continued
tracey
suggested
bridge
and
at
first
karen
flatly
refused
to
play
but
hugo
finally
persuaded
her
karen
would
do
absolutely
for
that
ridiculous
old
husband
of
hers
i
simply
ca
understand
it
how
she
can
be
in
love
with
him
i
mean
i
thought
you
liked
judge
marshall
dundee
laughed
oh
i
do
in
a
way
but
fancy
a
young
girl
like
karen
being
in
love
with
him
well
anyway
we
all
went
out
to
the
east
porch
which
is
kept
in
readiness
for
bridge
all
summer
iron
bridge
tables
covered
with
oilcloth
and
with
oilcloth
pouches
for
the
cards
and
score
pads
so
there
never
any
bother
about
scurrying
in
with
things
on
account
of
rain
it
a
roofed
porch
right
outside
the
and
under
it
are
the
garages
so
it
high
and
cool
with
a
grand
view
of
mirror
lake
down
below
and
of
the
city
in
the
distance
she
sighed
and
dundee
knew
that
she
was
thinking
of
her
own
lost
home
in
brentwood
the
fine
old
colonial
mansion
which
had
been
sacrificed
to
her
father
disastrous
primrose
meadows
venture
then
she
went
on
i
do
know
why
i
am
telling
you
all
this
except
that
the
setting
was
so
pleasant
that
we
should
have
had
a
much
better
time
than
we
did
you
an
artful
minx
penny
dundee
chuckled
you
working
up
suspense
for
the
entrance
of
the
villain
then
let
me
do
it
justice
penny
retorted
lois
and
peter
ralph
and
i
made
up
one
table
for
bridge
tracey
and
polly
judge
marshall
and
karen
the
other
flora
said
she
did
want
to
play
because
she
wanted
to
be
free
to
keep
an
eye
on
betty
although
she
protested
she
had
perfect
faith
in
lydia
who
flora
says
is
proving
to
be
a
marvel
with
the
children
and
johnny
drake
asked
her
to
play
anagrams
with
him
in
between
trips
to
the
nursery
johnny
has
a
perfect
pash
for
anagrams
and
is
a
wow
at
so
tracey
got
the
box
of
anagrams
out
of
the
trophy
room
the
trophy
room
dundee
repeated
amused
that
what
tracey
calls
it
penny
explained
impatiently
because
he
has
a
couple
of
golf
cups
and
flora
has
an
immense
silver
atrocity
which
testifies
to
the
fact
that
she
was
the
tennis
champion
of
the
state
for
one
year
there
are
also
some
mounted
fish
and
some
deer
heads
with
incredible
antlers
but
the
room
is
really
used
as
a
for
all
the
sports
things
racquets
golf
clubs
skis
table
etc
anyway
tracey
brought
out
the
box
of
anagrams
and
we
were
all
having
a
pretty
good
time
when
at
half
past
eight
the
butler
announced
dexter
your
tone
makes
me
wish
i
been
there
dundee
acknowledged
what
happened
you
know
how
tracey
always
is
penny
asked
grinning
well
you
should
have
seen
him
and
heard
him
as
he
dismissed
poor
whitson
the
butler
as
if
he
were
giving
him
notice
instead
of
letting
him
off
for
the
night
and
the
icy
dignity
with
which
he
greeted
poor
sprague
sprague
dundee
echoed
well
after
all
sprague
been
received
by
all
the
crowd
before
nita
death
penny
retorted
i
think
it
was
rather
natural
for
him
to
think
he
still
be
welcome
he
began
to
apologize
for
his
uninvited
presence
saying
he
had
felt
lonesome
and
depressed
and
had
just
into
a
taxi
and
come
along
hoping
to
find
the
mileses
in
flora
tried
to
act
the
lady
hostess
but
peter
got
up
from
his
bridge
table
and
said
in
tones
even
icier
than
tracey
you
excuse
me
flora
and
will
you
take
my
place
drake
i
going
into
the
library
i
do
enjoy
the
society
of
murderers
good
lord
dundee
ejaculated
shocked
but
admiring
did
sprague
make
a
quick
exit
not
just
then
penny
said
mysteriously
of
course
everyone
was
simply
stunned
but
sprague
retorted
cheerfully
do
i
dunlap
peter
stalked
on
into
the
living
room
on
his
way
to
the
library
johnny
took
his
place
at
the
bridge
table
and
tracey
at
an
urgent
signal
from
flora
offered
his
seat
at
the
other
table
to
sprague
as
if
he
were
making
way
for
a
leper
poor
polly
had
to
be
sprague
partner
flora
as
if
she
were
terrified
at
what
might
happen
you
know
how
frightfully
tense
and
nervous
she
is
made
an
excuse
to
run
upstairs
for
a
look
at
betty
and
something
terrible
did
happen
dundee
guessed
you
looking
positively
ghoulish
out
with
it
after
about
half
an
hour
of
playing
without
pivoting
penny
went
on
imperturbably
hugo
bid
three
spades
karen
raised
him
in
a
trembling
voice
to
five
spades
hugo
of
course
went
to
a
little
slam
and
dexter
sprague
if
you
can
believe
me
said
not
leave
the
table
karen
little
in
spades
has
been
known
to
be
fatal
to
the
dummy
dundee
was
genuinely
shocked
but
before
he
could
say
more
the
telephone
rang
sanderson
at
last
hello
chicago
oh
hello
captain
strawn
that
oh
my
god
where
did
you
say
the
body
is
he
listened
for
a
long
minute
then
with
a
dazed
thanks
i
be
over
he
hung
up
the
receiver
sprague
murdered
he
answered
the
horrified
question
in
penny
eyes
body
discovered
this
morning
about
nine
by
one
of
the
miles
maids
in
what
you
described
just
now
as
the
room
shot
just
below
the
breastbone
captain
strawn
says
the
trophy
room
penny
cried
then
where
he
was
all
the
time
after
he
disappeared
so
strangely
last
night
whoa
penny
dundee
commanded
get
hold
of
yourself
you
shaking
all
over
i
want
to
know
everything
know
as
quickly
and
as
accurately
as
you
can
tell
it
go
right
on
poor
dexter
penny
groaned
covering
her
convulsed
face
with
her
hands
to
think
that
he
was
when
we
were
saying
such
horrid
things
about
him
do
waste
sympathy
on
him
honey
dundee
cut
in
his
voice
very
gentle
but
urgent
if
he
had
heeded
my
warning
monday
he
would
be
dead
now
what
do
you
mean
penny
gasped
but
she
was
already
calmer
your
warning
i
had
a
strong
suspicion
that
he
was
mixed
up
with
nita
in
her
blackmail
scheme
and
i
took
the
trouble
to
warn
him
not
to
try
to
carry
on
with
it
yesterday
afternoon
i
begged
strawn
to
have
him
shadowed
to
see
that
he
kept
out
of
mischief
i
was
afraid
the
temptation
would
be
too
strong
for
him
but
strawn
would
listen
to
me
still
clinging
to
his
theory
of
a
new
york
gunman
feeling
better
now
honey
can
you
go
on
i
want
to
get
out
to
the
miles
house
as
soon
as
i
can
you
getting
very
affectionate
are
you
penny
gave
him
a
wobbly
smile
in
which
however
there
was
no
reproof
i
think
i
can
go
on
now
where
was
i
good
girl
dundee
applauded
but
his
heart
was
beating
hard
with
something
more
than
excitement
over
sprague
murder
you
just
told
me
about
sprague
warning
karen
not
to
leave
the
table
when
she
became
dummy
after
judge
marshall
little
slam
bid
in
spades
i
remember
penny
said
pressing
her
fingers
into
her
temples
but
karen
leave
the
table
when
sprague
said
that
awful
thing
poor
karen
burst
into
tears
and
ran
from
the
porch
into
the
living
room
hugo
started
to
follow
her
but
sprague
halted
him
by
apologizing
very
humbly
and
then
by
adding
really
like
to
see
you
play
this
hand
sir
i
believe
i
got
the
cards
to
set
you
with
of
course
he
could
not
have
said
anything
better
calculated
to
hold
hugo
who
as
i
said
is
a
regular
fiend
when
it
comes
to
bridge
well
hugo
played
the
hand
and
made
his
little
slam
and
then
he
again
started
to
go
look
for
karen
but
polly
who
was
sprague
partner
you
know
told
him
in
that
brusque
way
of
hers
to
go
on
with
the
game
and
give
karen
a
chance
to
have
her
little
weep
in
peace
probably
hugo
would
have
gone
to
look
for
her
anyway
but
just
then
flora
came
back
she
said
betty
was
asleep
at
last
and
that
her
temperature
was
normal
and
when
she
heard
about
karen
she
offered
to
take
her
hand
until
karen
felt
like
coming
back
what
did
drake
do
then
he
been
playing
anagrams
with
mrs
miles
you
said
dundee
interrupted
do
you
remember
i
told
you
johnny
had
taken
peter
place
at
our
table
after
peter
refused
to
breathe
the
same
air
as
dexter
sprague
penny
reminded
him
ralph
and
i
lois
and
johnny
were
playing
together
and
just
at
the
time
i
became
dummy
sprague
became
dummy
at
the
other
table
he
rose
saying
he
had
to
go
telephone
for
a
taxi
and
passed
from
the
porch
into
the
living
room
where
is
the
telephone
the
one
the
guests
use
is
on
a
table
in
the
hall
closet
where
we
put
our
things
penny
explained
you
can
shut
the
door
and
hold
a
perfectly
private
conversation
well
never
saw
dexter
sprague
good
lord
another
bridge
dummy
murdered
dundee
groaned
at
least
the
newspapers
will
be
happy
did
anyone
go
to
look
for
him
after
the
hand
was
played
not
straight
off
penny
answered
with
an
obvious
effort
to
remember
clearly
every
detail
let
see
oh
yes
that
hand
was
played
out
before
ralph
had
finished
playing
his
at
our
table
so
i
was
free
to
pay
attention
to
the
other
table
flora
said
that
since
they
play
another
hand
until
dexter
came
back
she
thought
she
better
hunt
up
karen
who
had
come
back
yet
how
long
was
mrs
miles
away
from
the
porch
dundee
asked
quickly
oh
i
do
know
ten
minutes
maybe
she
came
back
alone
saying
she
had
found
karen
in
her
bedroom
flora
room
of
course
crying
inconsolably
flora
told
hugo
he
better
go
up
to
her
himself
since
she
evidently
had
her
feelings
hurt
because
he
had
followed
her
in
the
first
place
tracey
who
was
playing
bridge
you
remember
because
he
had
given
up
his
place
to
sprague
asked
flora
if
she
seen
sprague
and
flora
said
in
a
surprised
voice
i
wonder
where
he
is
all
this
time
and
polly
said
that
probably
he
gone
to
the
lavatory
which
opens
into
the
main
hall
and
is
next
to
the
library
well
pretty
soon
judge
marshall
and
karen
came
back
pretty
soon
just
how
long
was
judge
marshall
gone
dundee
pressed
her
his
pencil
which
had
been
flying
to
take
down
her
every
word
poised
over
the
notebook
he
had
snatched
from
her
desk
i
ca
say
exactly
penny
protested
thornily
i
was
playing
again
at
the
other
table
i
suppose
it
was
about
ten
minutes
for
ralph
and
i
had
made
another
rubber
i
remember
anyway
karen
was
smiling
like
a
baby
that
has
had
a
lot
of
petting
but
she
said
hugo
had
promised
her
she
would
have
to
play
bridge
any
more
that
evening
so
flora
remained
at
that
table
playing
opposite
hugo
while
tracey
played
with
polly
as
soon
as
tracey
became
dummy
flora
suggested
he
go
look
for
sprague
and
how
long
was
gone
from
the
porch
dundee
asked
less
than
no
time
penny
assured
him
he
was
back
before
polly
had
finished
playing
the
hand
he
said
he
gone
to
the
hall
closet
where
whitson
the
butler
would
have
put
sprague
hat
and
stick
and
that
he
had
found
they
were
gone
well
and
you
need
put
down
every
time
i
say
it
penny
interrupted
herself
tartly
tracey
said
he
supposed
sprague
had
ordered
his
taxi
and
had
decided
to
walk
down
the
hill
to
meet
it
and
he
added
that
that
was
exactly
the
kind
of
courtesy
you
could
expect
from
a
cad
and
a
bounder
like
sprague
walking
in
uninvited
making
karen
cry
then
walking
out
without
a
word
leaving
the
game
while
he
was
dummy
flora
spoke
up
then
and
said
it
was
no
wonder
dexter
had
left
without
saying
considering
how
he
been
treated
then
tracey
said
something
ugly
and
sarcastic
about
being
disappointed
because
sprague
had
decided
not
to
spend
the
whole
evening
a
row
eh
dundee
interrupted
with
keen
interest
rather
flora
almost
cried
said
tracey
knew
good
and
well
that
she
had
only
been
to
sprague
before
nita
death
in
the
hope
of
getting
the
lead
in
the
hamilton
movie
if
sprague
got
the
job
of
directing
it
and
tracey
said
you
call
it
do
you
it
looked
like
flirting
to
me
or
maybe
it
was
more
than
a
flirtation
then
flora
told
him
he
had
acted
jealous
at
the
time
and
that
he
he
have
been
glad
if
she
got
the
lead
well
just
then
along
came
janet
raymond
dundee
ejaculated
i
thought
you
said
she
had
refused
the
invitation
when
mrs
miles
phoned
her
so
she
had
but
she
said
she
changed
her
mind
had
been
blue
all
evening
and
needed
cheering
up
how
did
she
get
in
she
walked
over
from
her
house
which
is
very
far
from
the
mileses
and
simply
came
up
the
path
to
the
porch
penny
explained
tracey
asked
her
if
she
had
seen
sprague
on
the
road
it
the
same
road
dexter
would
have
had
to
take
going
down
the
hill
to
the
main
road
and
she
acted
awfully
queer
how
dundee
demanded
exactly
as
she
would
act
since
she
was
in
love
with
him
penny
retorted
she
turned
very
red
and
asked
if
sprague
had
inquired
for
her
and
flora
quite
sharply
told
her
he
had
then
janet
said
she
was
very
much
surprised
that
sprague
had
been
there
and
that
she
understand
why
he
had
behaved
so
strangely
then
lois
said
she
might
as
well
go
fetch
peter
from
the
library
since
sprague
was
no
longer
there
to
contaminate
the
atmosphere
she
came
back
after
how
long
a
time
oh
about
five
minutes
i
suppose
penny
answered
wearily
she
came
in
her
arm
linked
with
peter
and
laughing
said
she
had
found
him
reading
a
dick
thriller
one
of
tracey
hobbies
she
broke
off
to
explain
is
collecting
thrillers
like
the
nick
carter
diamond
king
brady
buffalo
bill
and
deadwood
dick
books
of
course
he
did
take
up
that
hobby
until
a
lot
of
other
rich
men
had
done
it
first
there
was
never
anybody
less
original
than
poor
tracey
well
flora
gave
up
her
place
to
janet
and
again
played
anagrams
with
johnny
peter
taking
his
original
place
at
our
table
suddenly
polly
threw
down
her
cards
she
been
having
rotten
luck
and
seemed
out
of
sorts
and
said
she
did
want
to
play
bridge
any
more
so
poor
flora
again
had
to
be
the
perfect
hostess
and
switch
from
anagrams
to
bridge
and
polly
played
anagrams
with
drake
dundee
prompted
no
she
said
she
thought
anagrams
were
silly
and
wandered
off
the
porch
and
down
the
path
calling
over
her
shoulder
that
she
was
going
to
take
a
walk
tracey
asked
johnny
if
he
mind
mixing
the
highballs
and
bringing
out
the
sandwiches
said
whitson
had
left
a
thermos
bucket
of
ice
cubes
on
the
sideboard
some
bottles
of
ginger
ale
and
a
tray
of
glasses
and
sandwiches
told
him
he
find
decanters
of
scotch
and
rye
and
to
bring
out
both
so
drake
left
the
room
too
dundee
mused
oh
lord
i
find
that
every
last
one
of
the
six
had
a
chance
to
kill
sprague
as
well
as
nita
how
long
was
polly
beale
gone
on
this
walk
of
hers
she
came
in
with
a
pink
water
lily
said
she
been
down
to
the
lily
ponds
and
that
flora
had
enough
to
spare
her
one
penny
answered
she
could
have
been
away
more
than
ten
minutes
because
johnny
was
just
mixing
the
highballs
according
to
our
preference
for
scotch
or
rye
or
plain
ginger
ale
which
both
ralph
and
i
chose
after
we
had
our
drinks
and
the
sandwiches
we
went
on
with
bridge
polly
and
johnny
just
wandered
about
the
porch
or
watched
the
game
at
the
two
tables
and
about
five
minutes
after
eleven
clive
hammond
arrived
coming
up
the
path
to
the
porch
just
as
janet
had
after
he
came
there
was
no
more
bridge
but
we
sat
around
on
the
porch
and
talked
until
midnight
clive
said
he
was
too
tired
to
play
bridge
that
he
been
struggling
all
evening
with
a
knotty
problem
i
can
sympathize
with
him
dundee
said
grimly
as
he
rose
i
got
my
own
knotty
problem
awaiting
me
when
that
call
comes
through
from
chicago
tell
sanderson
the
bad
news
and
say
i
telephone
him
later
chapter
the
miles
home
still
known
in
hamilton
as
the
hackett
place
since
it
had
been
built
more
than
thirty
years
before
by
flora
father
old
silas
hackett
dead
these
seven
years
dominated
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
wooded
hills
which
encircled
mirror
lake
in
the
brentwood
section
of
modified
tudor
architecture
its
deep
red
mellowed
bricks
had
achieved
in
three
decades
almost
the
same
aged
dignity
and
impressiveness
as
characterized
the
mansion
in
england
which
silas
hackett
architect
had
used
as
an
inspiration
the
big
house
faced
the
lake
a
long
series
of
landscaped
terraces
leading
down
to
the
water
edge
but
the
driveway
wound
from
the
state
road
up
a
side
of
the
hill
to
the
main
entrance
at
the
rear
of
the
house
once
before
on
sunday
the
day
after
nita
selim
murder
when
he
had
come
to
interview
lydia
carr
and
had
secured
the
alibi
which
had
eliminated
dexter
sprague
as
a
suspect
dundee
had
driven
his
car
up
this
hill
between
the
tall
yew
hedges
but
then
he
had
taken
the
fork
which
led
to
the
hooded
doorway
over
the
kitchen
had
descended
the
kitchen
stairs
with
lydia
to
the
servants
sitting
room
in
the
basement
now
he
continued
along
the
main
driveway
to
the
more
impressive
entrance
whose
flanking
slim
turrets
frowned
down
upon
a
line
of
police
cars
and
motorcycles
his
approach
must
have
been
expected
and
observed
for
it
was
the
master
of
the
house
who
opened
the
great
doors
and
invited
the
detective
into
the
broad
main
hall
at
the
end
of
which
down
three
steps
lay
the
immense
living
room
the
detective
first
glance
took
in
stately
armchairs
of
the
cromwell
period
thick
rugs
and
in
the
living
room
beyond
splendid
examples
of
jacobean
furniture
a
horrible
thing
to
happen
in
a
man
home
dundee
miles
was
saying
his
plump
rosy
face
blighted
with
horror
i
ca
realize
yet
that
we
actually
slept
as
usual
with
a
corpse
lying
down
here
all
night
and
i
have
only
myself
to
blame
what
do
you
mean
dundee
asked
why
that
the
the
body
was
discovered
sooner
miles
explained
if
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
whitson
had
closed
the
trophy
room
windows
i
should
have
gone
in
to
close
and
lock
them
when
i
made
the
rounds
of
living
room
dining
room
and
library
after
our
guests
were
gone
last
night
a
butler
had
materialized
while
his
master
was
speaking
beg
pardon
sir
but
i
did
not
close
the
trophy
room
windows
because
i
thought
you
might
be
using
the
room
again
you
see
sir
and
whitson
turned
to
dundee
mr
miles
and
dunlap
played
in
the
trophy
room
after
dinner
until
the
other
guests
began
to
arrive
and
i
did
not
want
them
to
find
the
room
stuffy
it
was
a
warm
night
if
any
of
the
guests
i
see
dundee
interrupted
who
to
your
knowledge
was
the
last
person
to
enter
the
trophy
room
last
night
mr
miles
i
was
except
sprague
of
course
and
i
had
no
idea
he
gone
there
drake
wanted
to
play
anagrams
and
before
the
bridge
game
started
i
went
to
the
trophy
room
to
get
the
box
miles
explained
i
turned
off
the
light
when
i
left
and
there
was
no
light
burning
in
there
this
morning
when
celia
the
parlor
maid
went
there
to
put
the
anagram
box
back
in
the
cabinet
and
found
the
body
flora
mrs
miles
had
brought
the
anagrams
in
from
the
porch
and
left
them
on
a
table
in
the
living
room
as
our
guests
were
getting
ready
to
leave
there
was
nothing
else
to
bring
in
in
case
of
rain
the
bridge
tables
are
of
iron
covered
with
oilcloth
and
fitted
with
oilcloth
bags
for
the
cards
score
pads
and
pencils
yes
i
know
dundee
interrupted
miss
crain
has
already
told
me
all
about
that
and
a
good
many
details
of
the
party
itself
by
the
way
where
is
mrs
miles
now
in
bed
the
doctor
is
with
her
she
is
prostrated
from
the
shock
where
is
this
room
you
call
the
trophy
room
dundee
asked
no
bother
to
come
with
me
just
point
it
out
it
on
this
floor
i
understand
miles
pointed
past
the
great
circular
staircase
that
wound
upward
from
the
main
hall
you
ca
see
the
door
from
here
but
it
behind
the
staircase
celia
found
the
door
closed
this
morning
and
no
light
on
as
i
said
dundee
cut
him
short
by
marching
toward
the
door
which
was
again
closed
he
entered
so
noiselessly
that
captain
strawn
price
and
the
fingerprint
expert
carraway
did
not
hear
him
for
a
moment
he
stood
just
inside
the
door
and
let
his
eyes
wander
about
the
room
which
penny
crain
had
already
described
it
was
not
a
large
room
twelve
by
fourteen
feet
possibly
but
it
looked
even
smaller
crowded
as
it
was
with
the
long
table
bags
of
golf
clubs
fishing
tackle
tennis
racquets
skis
and
sleds
there
were
two
windows
in
the
north
wall
of
the
room
looking
out
upon
the
driveway
and
between
them
stood
a
cabinet
of
numerous
big
and
little
drawers
not
until
he
had
taken
in
the
general
aspect
of
the
room
did
dundee
look
at
the
thing
over
which
captain
strawn
and
the
coroner
were
bending
the
body
of
dexter
sprague
the
alien
from
new
york
had
fallen
about
four
feet
from
the
window
nearer
the
east
wall
of
the
trophy
room
he
lay
on
his
side
his
left
cheek
against
the
floor
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
still
clutching
the
bosom
of
his
soft
shirt
now
stiff
with
dried
blood
a
pool
of
which
had
formed
and
then
half
congealed
upon
the
rug
the
right
hand
the
fingers
curled
but
not
touching
each
other
lay
on
the
floor
at
the
end
of
the
rigid
outstretched
arm
the
one
visible
eye
was
half
open
but
on
the
sallow
thin
face
which
had
been
strikingly
handsome
in
an
obvious
sort
of
way
was
a
peace
and
dignity
which
dundee
had
never
seen
upon
sprague
face
when
the
man
was
alive
the
left
leg
was
drawn
upward
so
that
the
knee
almost
touched
the
stomach
how
long
has
he
been
dead
doctor
dundee
asked
quietly
hello
boy
price
greeted
him
placidly
always
the
same
question
i
been
here
only
a
few
minutes
and
i
already
told
strawn
that
i
shall
probably
be
unable
to
fix
the
hour
of
death
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
took
your
time
did
you
bonnie
captain
strawn
greeted
his
former
subordinate
on
the
homicide
squad
doc
says
he
been
dead
between
ten
and
twelve
hours
since
it
nearly
ten
now
that
means
sprague
was
killed
some
time
between
nine
and
eleven
last
night
better
say
between
nine
and
midnight
last
night
price
suggested
he
may
have
lived
an
hour
or
more
unconscious
of
course
for
the
indications
are
that
he
did
not
die
instantly
but
staggered
a
few
steps
clutching
at
the
wound
but
of
course
i
shall
have
to
perform
an
autopsy
first
dundee
crossed
the
room
stepping
over
the
dead
man
stick
a
swank
affair
of
dark
polished
wood
with
a
heavy
knob
of
carved
onyx
which
lay
about
a
foot
beyond
the
reach
of
the
curled
fingers
of
the
stiff
right
hand
sprague
hat
he
asked
pointing
to
a
brightly
banded
straw
which
lay
upon
the
top
of
the
cabinet
yes
strawn
answered
and
did
you
notice
the
window
screen
he
pointed
to
the
window
in
front
of
which
the
body
lay
the
sash
of
leaded
panes
was
raised
as
high
as
it
would
go
and
beneath
it
was
a
screen
of
the
type
raised
about
six
inches
from
the
window
sill
a
pair
of
curved
catches
in
the
center
of
the
metal
band
on
the
bottom
of
the
coppernet
curtain
showed
how
the
screen
was
raised
or
lowered
dundee
nodded
frowning
and
strawn
began
eagerly
you
have
to
admit
i
was
right
now
boy
you
sneered
at
my
gunman
theory
and
tried
to
pin
nita
murder
on
one
of
hamilton
finest
bunch
of
people
but
you
have
to
admit
now
that
every
detail
of
this
bears
me
out
yes
sure
this
is
the
way
i
figure
it
out
sprague
has
good
reason
to
be
afraid
he
next
on
the
program
he
nervous
he
hops
a
taxi
at
his
hotel
and
comes
here
ca
stick
to
his
room
any
longer
wants
a
little
human
companionship
this
crowd
here
and
i
have
miles
word
for
it
ai
any
too
glad
to
see
him
and
shows
it
he
phones
for
a
taxi
to
go
back
to
his
hotel
about
that
was
miles
says
but
decides
to
walk
down
the
hill
to
meet
it
do
want
to
go
back
out
on
the
porch
and
lie
about
having
had
a
good
time
when
he
has
well
he
opens
the
front
door
or
what
would
be
the
front
door
if
this
was
any
ordinary
house
but
before
he
steps
out
he
sees
or
hears
something
probably
a
rustling
in
the
hedge
across
the
driveway
or
maybe
he
even
sees
a
face
in
the
light
from
the
lanterns
on
each
side
of
the
door
he
feels
sure
nita
murderer
has
trailed
him
and
is
lying
in
wait
for
him
in
a
panic
he
darts
into
this
room
and
do
turn
on
the
light
for
fear
he
be
seen
from
the
windows
but
he
can
see
well
enough
to
make
out
how
the
screens
work
and
he
was
familiar
with
the
house
anyway
i
bet
you
anything
you
like
sprague
stayed
in
this
room
for
an
hour
or
two
till
he
thought
the
coast
was
clear
then
eased
up
this
screen
intending
to
climb
out
of
the
window
and
drop
to
the
ground
not
much
of
a
drop
at
that
you
can
see
that
the
tall
hedge
on
this
side
of
the
driveway
comes
pretty
near
up
to
these
windows
well
i
figure
he
laid
his
hat
on
this
cabinet
intending
to
reach
in
for
it
when
he
was
outside
but
that
he
had
already
made
some
little
noise
which
the
gunman
was
listening
for
and
that
when
he
got
the
screen
up
this
high
the
gunman
crouching
under
the
window
let
go
with
the
same
gun
and
silencer
that
he
used
to
bump
off
nita
i
got
miles
word
for
it
that
neither
he
nor
anybody
else
heard
a
shot
of
course
nobody
knew
sprague
was
in
here
and
since
his
hat
and
stick
was
both
missing
from
the
hall
closet
they
took
it
for
granted
he
beat
it
any
objections
to
that
theory
boy
just
a
few
one
in
particular
dundee
said
but
i
grant
it
a
good
one
provided
price
autopsy
bears
you
out
as
to
the
course
of
the
bullet
and
that
carraway
finds
sprague
fingerprints
on
that
contrivance
for
raising
the
screen
even
then
but
dundee
was
not
allowed
to
finish
his
sentence
for
strawn
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
by
whitson
when
he
returned
there
was
a
slightly
bewildered
look
on
his
heavy
old
face
that
funny
collins
the
lad
i
sent
to
check
up
on
the
taxi
companies
says
he
located
the
driver
that
answered
sprague
call
last
night
the
driver
says
he
was
called
about
told
to
come
immediately
and
to
wait
for
sprague
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
main
road
he
says
he
waited
there
until
half
past
ten
then
went
on
back
to
town
a
boiled
owl
it
does
look
exactly
as
if
sprague
were
afraid
of
anyone
of
this
last
night
does
it
dundee
asked
by
the
way
i
suppose
you
sent
for
everyone
who
was
here
sure
but
again
captain
strawn
looked
uncomfortable
but
we
been
able
to
locate
the
beale
girl
and
clive
hammond
chapter
i
give
a
good
deal
to
know
which
of
those
two
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
get
married
the
first
thing
this
morning
dundee
mused
aloud
as
he
put
down
the
second
extra
which
hamilton
morning
had
had
occasion
to
issue
that
thursday
it
was
two
and
the
district
attorney
special
investigator
sat
across
the
desk
from
captain
strawn
in
his
former
chief
office
at
police
headquarters
the
first
extra
had
screamed
in
its
biggest
head
type
second
bridge
dummy
murder
and
had
carried
in
detail
captain
strawn
comforting
theory
that
dexter
sprague
erstwhile
friends
had
again
been
made
the
victims
of
a
new
york
gunman
fiendish
cleverness
in
committing
his
murders
under
circumstances
which
would
inevitably
involve
most
highly
respected
and
socially
prominent
citizens
in
the
police
investigation
but
the
second
extra
had
a
more
romantic
streamer
headline
hammond
wedding
delays
murder
quiz
the
story
beneath
a
series
of
smaller
headlines
began
at
the
very
moment
this
morning
when
celia
hunt
maid
in
the
tracey
miles
home
in
the
brentwood
district
of
hamilton
was
screaming
the
news
of
her
discovery
of
the
dead
body
of
dexter
sprague
new
york
motion
picture
director
in
what
is
known
as
the
room
miss
polly
beale
and
clive
hammond
were
applying
for
a
marriage
license
in
the
municipal
building
at
when
miss
beale
and
hammond
were
exchanging
their
vows
in
the
rectory
of
paul
episcopal
church
of
which
both
bride
and
groom
have
been
members
since
childhood
captain
john
strawn
of
the
homicide
squad
was
listening
to
tracey
miles
account
of
the
strange
disappearance
of
dexter
sprague
last
night
from
an
impromptu
bridge
game
after
he
had
announced
his
intention
of
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
he
was
to
telephone
for
a
taxi
and
at
when
the
new
hammond
called
her
home
to
break
the
news
of
her
marriage
to
her
aunt
amelia
beale
the
bride
was
in
turn
acquainted
with
the
news
of
sprague
murder
and
the
fact
that
both
she
and
her
husband
were
wanted
at
the
miles
home
for
questioning
by
the
police
since
both
had
been
guests
of
and
mrs
miles
last
night
although
hammond
did
not
arrive
until
about
there
followed
a
revision
of
the
murder
story
as
it
had
appeared
in
the
first
extra
with
additional
details
supplied
by
strawn
and
with
a
line
drawing
of
the
scene
of
the
crime
the
trophy
room
itself
and
the
forked
driveway
with
its
tall
yew
hedges
a
dotted
line
illustrated
theory
of
sprague
plan
to
elude
the
murderer
who
had
followed
him
to
the
miles
home
because
of
the
curved
sweep
of
the
driveway
toward
the
main
entrance
of
the
house
the
tall
hedge
was
less
than
two
feet
from
the
window
with
the
partly
opened
screen
captain
strawn
theory
read
the
text
below
the
large
drawing
is
that
sprague
had
good
cause
to
fear
he
was
being
followed
on
his
way
to
the
miles
home
that
he
telephoned
for
a
taxi
to
wait
for
him
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
that
he
planned
to
leave
the
miles
house
by
way
of
the
trophy
room
window
so
that
his
lurking
pursuer
might
have
no
knowledge
of
his
departure
the
drawing
shows
that
his
proposed
flight
would
have
been
protected
by
hedges
until
he
reached
the
wooded
slope
of
the
hill
provided
his
nemesis
was
lurking
in
the
opposite
hedge
across
the
driveway
where
he
could
observe
every
departure
from
the
miles
home
you
sure
got
a
mind
boy
strawn
chuckled
so
you
think
those
two
got
married
in
such
a
hurry
this
morning
because
the
law
says
a
husband
or
a
wife
ca
be
made
to
testify
against
the
other
possibly
dundee
grinned
unruffled
but
there
is
another
possibility
which
is
why
i
should
like
to
know
who
suggested
this
sudden
wedding
i
mean
that
we
ca
overlook
the
possibility
that
these
two
murders
made
either
the
bride
or
the
groom
feel
perfectly
safe
in
going
on
with
the
marriage
polly
beale
and
clive
hammond
had
been
engaged
for
more
than
a
year
you
know
with
no
apparent
reason
for
a
long
engagement
as
for
my
having
a
mind
captain
what
about
you
i
have
six
possible
suspects
all
of
whose
names
i
know
and
you
have
only
one
whose
name
you
do
not
know
and
whose
motive
you
can
only
guess
at
while
have
a
perfectly
good
motive
that
might
fit
any
one
of
my
six
blackmail
is
that
so
strawn
growled
i
not
telling
the
papers
everything
and
if
they
are
satisfied
to
call
these
murders
it
all
right
with
me
but
i
not
forgetting
that
nita
selim
banked
ten
thousand
dollars
cash
after
she
got
to
hamilton
my
real
theory
now
that
sprague
has
been
killed
is
that
nita
and
sprague
had
cooked
up
some
sort
of
racket
between
them
and
that
when
nita
got
the
chance
to
come
to
hamilton
with
dunlap
she
jumped
at
it
and
she
and
sprague
sprung
their
racket
whatever
it
was
either
just
before
or
just
after
nita
left
new
york
probably
it
was
nita
and
sprague
did
the
actual
dirty
work
himself
which
explains
that
telegram
that
nita
sent
him
april
just
three
days
after
she
got
to
hamilton
let
see
again
just
what
it
says
and
strawn
reached
for
a
copy
of
the
night
letter
which
dundee
himself
had
unearthed
the
day
before
see
jake
so
far
but
would
feel
safer
you
yes
i
remember
the
wording
quite
well
dundee
interrupted
but
you
did
not
take
it
so
seriously
when
i
showed
it
to
you
yesterday
if
you
had
all
right
rub
it
in
strawn
snapped
flushing
darkly
if
i
had
assigned
a
man
to
sprague
as
you
suggested
he
would
have
been
murdered
he
probably
would
have
been
murdered
just
the
same
dundee
comforted
the
older
man
but
we
might
have
been
lucky
enough
to
have
had
an
oh
you
and
your
theory
strawn
growled
but
let
me
go
on
nita
meant
she
would
feel
safer
about
sprague
if
he
was
here
in
hamilton
too
but
the
guy
they
in
new
york
or
worked
the
badger
game
on
or
something
like
that
got
on
their
trail
but
it
took
him
weeks
to
do
it
and
sprague
followed
nita
advice
he
got
here
on
sunday
april
and
on
monday
the
nita
banked
the
first
do
you
see
it
boy
sprague
brought
with
him
the
dough
they
got
for
their
stunt
and
thought
it
was
safer
for
nita
to
bank
it
in
her
name
since
it
was
the
name
she
was
known
by
in
new
york
anyway
checked
up
on
sprague
pretty
thoroughly
he
did
have
a
bank
book
either
on
his
body
or
in
his
room
and
every
bank
in
town
denies
he
had
an
account
with
them
if
that
theory
is
correct
it
makes
nita
selim
a
pretty
low
character
dundee
mused
aloud
not
only
did
she
kick
him
out
as
a
lover
but
she
him
as
her
partner
in
crime
by
willing
the
whole
wad
to
lydia
carr
sprague
must
have
received
quite
a
shock
when
he
heard
nita
will
read
at
the
inquest
yeah
strawn
agreed
it
looks
like
dunlap
picked
a
sweet
specimen
to
make
a
friend
out
of
well
that
my
theory
and
i
think
it
explains
everything
their
victim
in
new
york
simply
hired
a
gunman
or
come
down
here
himself
when
he
got
on
their
tracks
of
course
it
was
a
good
stunt
to
make
it
look
like
a
local
crime
figured
he
fool
just
as
he
fooled
so
the
murderer
simply
trailed
nita
around
and
saw
that
whole
bunch
of
society
people
shooting
at
a
target
at
judge
marshall
place
with
a
gun
equipped
with
a
maxim
silencer
too
good
an
opportunity
to
be
missed
so
he
bides
his
chance
to
swipe
the
gun
and
silencer
to
make
sure
it
will
look
like
a
local
crime
he
pops
off
nita
when
that
same
bunch
is
at
her
house
but
it
takes
a
few
days
longer
before
he
has
the
same
opportunity
to
get
sprague
but
it
come
last
night
and
he
grabbed
it
a
very
plausible
theory
and
one
which
in
general
the
whole
city
of
hamilton
has
been
familiar
with
since
the
night
nita
was
murdered
dundee
remarked
significantly
what
do
you
mean
strawn
demanded
it
waterproof
ai
it
doc
price
says
the
bullet
and
a
caliber
one
at
that
entered
body
just
below
the
breastbone
and
traveled
an
upward
course
till
it
struck
the
extreme
right
side
of
the
heart
the
bullet
entered
exactly
where
it
would
have
to
if
the
murderer
was
crouching
under
that
window
while
sprague
was
raising
the
screen
and
we
have
carraway
report
that
it
was
sprague
fingerprints
on
those
nickleplated
things
you
have
to
press
together
to
make
the
screen
roll
up
or
down
furthermore
i
have
a
doubt
in
the
world
that
the
ballistics
expert
in
chicago
will
report
that
the
bullet
was
fired
from
the
same
gun
that
killed
nita
selim
neither
have
i
dundee
agreed
but
what
i
meant
was
that
you
had
obligingly
furnished
the
murderer
who
fits
theory
with
a
theory
he
or
she
would
not
have
upset
for
the
world
listen
and
he
bent
forward
very
earnestly
i
willing
to
grant
that
sprague
was
shot
from
the
outside
through
the
window
when
sprague
raised
the
screen
but
there
our
theories
part
company
i
believe
that
the
murderer
was
a
guest
in
the
selim
home
last
night
that
he
or
she
had
made
an
appointment
to
meet
sprague
there
on
the
promise
of
paying
the
hush
money
he
had
demanded
in
spite
of
my
warning
to
him
not
to
carry
on
with
the
blackmail
scheme
naturally
he
or
she
and
i
say
from
now
on
for
the
sake
of
convenience
had
no
intention
of
being
seen
entering
that
room
the
bridge
game
was
suggested
by
judge
marshall
at
noon
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
the
rendezvous
to
be
made
with
sprague
as
i
see
it
the
murderer
told
sprague
to
excuse
himself
from
the
game
when
he
became
dummy
and
to
go
to
the
trophy
room
and
wait
there
until
the
murderer
had
a
chance
to
slip
away
and
appear
beneath
the
window
sprague
had
been
promised
that
when
he
raised
the
screen
at
a
tap
or
a
whispered
request
a
roll
of
bills
would
be
handed
to
him
but
he
received
a
bullet
instead
and
which
one
of
your
six
suspects
have
you
picked
on
strawn
asked
sarcastically
that
just
the
trouble
there
are
still
six
dundee
acknowledged
with
a
wry
grin
after
sprague
disappearance
every
one
of
the
six
was
absent
from
the
porch
at
one
time
or
another
no
by
george
there
are
suspects
now
i
was
about
to
forget
peter
dunlap
who
admits
he
was
alone
on
a
fishing
trip
when
nita
was
murdered
and
who
left
the
porch
last
night
to
go
to
the
library
as
soon
as
sprague
arrived
as
for
the
movements
of
the
original
six
after
sprague
disappeared
polly
beale
took
a
walk
about
the
grounds
flora
miles
went
upstairs
to
hunt
for
karen
marshall
and
was
gone
more
than
ten
minutes
drake
went
to
the
dining
room
to
get
the
refreshments
and
no
one
can
say
exactly
how
long
he
was
gone
judge
marshall
went
up
to
get
his
wife
and
had
time
to
make
a
little
trip
on
the
side
janet
raymond
walked
over
from
her
home
and
passed
that
very
window
arriving
after
sprague
had
disappeared
and
finally
clive
hammond
arrived
alone
in
his
car
which
he
parked
within
a
few
feet
of
that
window
this
morning
he
gets
married
a
telegram
sir
interrupted
a
plainclothesman
who
had
entered
without
knocking
strawn
snatched
at
it
read
it
then
exulted
read
this
boy
i
guess
settles
the
business
the
telegram
had
been
filed
half
an
hour
before
and
was
from
the
city
editor
of
new
york
evening
working
on
your
theory
of
new

gunman
responsible
murders
of
juanita
leigh

this

has
discovered
that

well
that
puts
the

do
it
strawn
crowed
i
send
sergeant
turner
to
new

on
the
five
train
pretty
decent
of
that
city
editor
to
wire
me
this
tip
i
say
and
are
you
going
to
reciprocate
by
wiring
him
about
the
nita
banked
here
dundee
asked
sure
why
not
there
no
use
that
i
can
see
to
keep
it
back
any
longer
now
that
no
one
can
have
any
excuse
to
think
as
you
been
doing
that
it
was
blackmail
paid
by
a
hamiltonian
then
dundee
began
very
slowly
if
you
really
think
your
case
is
solved
i
make
one
suggestion
take
charge
of
lydia
carr
and
put
her
in
a
very
safe
place
why
strawn
looked
puzzled
because
when
you
publish
the
fact
that
nita
and
sprague
got
for
tipping
off
savelli
gang
that
he
was
them
and
that
nita
willed
the
money
to
lydia
the
avenger
next
and
last
job
would
be
to
lydia
since
his
natural
conclusion
would
be
that
lydia
had
been
in
on
the
scheme
from
the
beginning
dundee
explained
god
boy
you
right
strawn
exclaimed
and
his
heavy
old
face
was
very
pale
as
he
reached
for
the
telephone
and
called
the
number
of
the
miles
residence
i
going
to
put
it
up
to
her
that
it
will
be
best
for
her
to
be
locked
up
as
a
material
witness
for
her
own
protection
five
minutes
later
strawn
restored
the
receiver
to
the
hook
with
a
bang
says
she
wo
budge
he
explained
unnecessarily
says
she
afraid
and
the
miles
kids
need
her
well
it
her
own
funeral
but
i
guess
are
convinced
at
last
dundee
slowly
shook
his
head
almost
but
not
quite
chief
lord
but
you
stubborn
here
a
case
a
very
pretty
and
a
very
satisfactory
case
but
not
exactly
dundee
interrupted
there
just
one
little
thing
what
do
you
mean
strawn
demanded
irritably
have
you
forgotten
the
secret
shelf
behind
the
guest
closet
in
the
selim
house
dundee
asked
i
can
afford
to
forget
it
since
it
has
got
a
thing
to
do
with
the
case
strawn
retorted
angrily
there
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
of
course
it
does
not
fit
into
theory
dundee
agreed
for
sammy
avenging
brother
could
not
have
known
of
its
existence
but
there
is
one
thing
about
that
secret
shelf
and
its
pivot
door
which
i
do
believe
you
can
afford
to
forget
captain
yeah
strawn
snarled
yeah
i
refer
of
course
to
the
complete
absence
of
fingerprints
on
the
door
and
on
the
shelf
itself
carraway
did
even
find
nita
fingerprints
since
nita
would
have
had
no
earthly
reason
for
carefully
wiping
off
her
fingerprints
after
she
removed
the
papers
she
burned
on
friday
night
it
a
dead
sure
fact
that
someone
else
who
had
no
legitimate
business
to
do
so
touched
that
pivoting
panel
and
the
shelf
and
carefully
removed
all
traces
that
he
had
done
so
and
he
continued
grimly
until
i
find
out
who
that
someone
is
i
for
one
wo
consider
the
case
solved
fifteen
minutes
later
dundee
was
sitting
at
penny
crain
desk
in
her
office
of
the
district
attorney
suite
replacing
the
receiver
upon
the
telephone
hook
after
having
put
in
a
call
for
sanderson
who
was
still
in
chicago
keeping
vigil
at
the
bedside
of
his
dying
mother
did
you
find
out
anything
new
when
you
questioned
the
crowd
this
morning
penny
asked
besides
the
fact
that
polly
and
clive
got
married
this
morning
i
mean
i
was
surprised
when
i
read
about
the
wedding
in
the
extra
it
was
exactly
like
polly
to
make
up
her
mind
suddenly
after
putting
clive
off
for
a
year
so
it
was
polly
who
held
back
dundee
said
to
himself
aloud
no
i
did
learn
much
new
penny
you
a
most
excellent
and
accurate
reporter
but
there
were
one
or
two
things
that
came
out
for
instance
i
got
drake
to
admit
to
me
in
private
that
nita
did
give
him
an
explanation
as
to
where
she
got
the
yes
penny
prompted
eagerly
drake
says
dundee
answered
dryly
that
nita
told
him
it
was
alimony
which
she
had
succeeded
in
collecting
from
her
former
husband
unfortunately
she
did
not
say
who
or
where
the
mysterious
husband
is
pooh
scoffed
penny
do
you
see
she
just
said
that
to
satisfy
johnny
curiosity
after
all
it
was
the
most
plausible
explanation
of
how
a
divorcee
got
hold
of
a
lot
of
money
so
plausible
that
drake
may
have
thought
of
it
himself
dundee
reflected
silently
aloud
he
continued
his
report
to
the
girl
who
had
been
of
so
much
help
to
him
among
other
minor
things
that
came
out
this
morning
and
which
the
papers
did
not
report
was
the
fact
that
janet
raymond
tried
to
commit
suicide
this
morning
by
drinking
shoe
polish
fortunately
her
father
discovered
what
she
had
done
almost
as
soon
as
she
had
swallowed
the
stuff
and
made
her
take
ipecac
and
then
sent
for
the
doctor
oh
poor
janet
penny
groaned
she
must
have
been
terribly
in
love
with
dexter
sprague
though
what
she
saw
in
him
dundee
made
no
comment
but
continued
with
his
information
another
minor
development
was
that
tracey
miles
admitted
that
he
and
flora
had
quarreled
over
sprague
after
all
of
you
left
and
that
flora
took
two
sleeping
tablets
to
make
sure
of
a
night
rest
she
been
awfully
unstrung
ever
since
nita
murder
penny
defended
her
friend
she
told
us
all
monday
night
at
peter
that
the
doctor
had
prescribed
sleeping
medicine
now
you
look
here
bonnie
dundee
she
cried
out
sharply
answering
an
enigmatic
smile
on
the
detective
face
if
you
think
flora
miles
killed
nita
selim
and
dexter
sprague
because
she
was
in
love
with
dexter
and
learned
he
was
nita
lover
from
that
silly
note
whoa
penny
dundee
checked
her
i
not
linking
exactly
that
but
i
just
remembered
something
that
had
seemed
of
no
importance
to
me
before
and
what
that
smart
aleck
penny
demanded
furiously
before
i
answer
that
question
will
you
let
me
do
a
little
theorizing
dundee
suggested
gently
let
us
suppose
that
flora
miles
was
in
love
with
sprague
but
that
she
was
being
blackmailed
by
nita
for
some
scandal
nita
had
heard
gossiped
about
at
the
forsyte
school
no
wait
let
us
suppose
further
that
nita
recognized
flora
picture
in
the
group
lois
dunlap
showed
her
as
the
portrait
of
the
girl
whose
story
she
had
heard
that
she
was
able
somehow
to
secure
incriminating
evidence
of
some
sort
letters
let
us
say
nita
tells
sprague
about
it
and
sprague
advises
her
to
blackmail
flora
who
lois
has
told
nita
is
very
rich
so
nita
comes
to
hamilton
and
bleeds
flora
of
not
satisfied
nita
makes
another
demand
the
money
to
be
paid
to
her
the
day
of
the
bridge
luncheon
silly
penny
scoffed
furiously
the
only
evidence
you
have
against
poor
flora
is
that
she
stole
the
note
dexter
had
written
to
nita
that
the
crux
of
the
matter
penny
darling
dundee
assured
her
in
a
maddeningly
soothing
voice
at
which
penny
clinched
her
hands
in
impotent
rage
flora
seeing
nita
receive
a
letter
written
on
her
husband
business
stationery
jumps
to
the
conclusion
that
nita
had
carried
out
her
threat
to
tell
tracey
or
that
nita
has
at
least
given
tracey
a
hint
of
the
truth
and
that
tracey
note
is
let
us
say
a
confirmation
of
an
appointment
suggested
by
nita
very
well
flora
goes
to
nita
bedroom
at
the
first
opportunity
knowing
that
nita
will
come
there
to
make
up
for
the
men
arrival
suppose
flora
had
brought
the
gun
and
silencer
with
her
intending
to
frighten
nita
rather
than
kill
her
but
having
had
proof
as
she
believes
that
nita
means
business
flora
waits
in
the
closet
until
nita
comes
in
and
sits
down
at
her
then
steps
out
and
shoots
her
then
she
recoils
step
by
step
until
her
foot
catches
in
the
slack
cord
of
the
bronze
lamp
causing
the
very
or
bump
which
flora
herself
describes
later
for
fear
someone
else
has
heard
it
her
first
concern
of
course
is
to
hide
the
gun
and
silencer
she
remembers
judge
marshall
tale
of
the
secret
shelf
in
the
guest
closet
and
not
only
hides
the
gun
there
but
seeks
in
vain
for
the
incriminating
evidence
nita
has
against
her
but
she
also
remembers
the
note
she
believes
tracey
has
written
to
nita
and
which
if
found
after
nita
death
may
give
her
away
so
she
goes
to
the
closet
in
nita
bedroom
finds
the
note
and
faints
with
horror
at
her
perhaps
needless
crime
when
she
realizes
that
the
note
was
written
by
sprague
and
not
tracey
of
course
she
is
too
ill
and
to
leave
the
closet
until
the
murder
is
discovered
but
you
think
she
was
not
too
to
have
the
presence
of
mind
to
retrieve
the
gun
and
silencer
and
walk
out
with
them
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
police
penny
scoffed
i
think
she
was
dundee
amazed
her
by
admitting
and
that
is
where
my
sudden
recollection
of
something
i
had
considered
unimportant
comes
in
let
us
suppose
that
flora
by
tracey
confesses
to
him
in
their
car
as
they
are
going
to
the
country
club
for
their
dinner
as
were
the
rest
of
you
tracey
loyal
to
her
decides
to
help
her
he
tells
her
to
suggest
at
dinner
that
lydia
come
to
them
as
nurse
so
that
he
can
go
back
to
the
house
and
get
the
gun
and
silencer
from
the
hiding
place
if
an
opportunity
presents
itself
as
it
did
since
i
left
tracey
miles
alone
in
the
hall
while
i
went
into
nita
bedroom
to
talk
with
lydia
before
i
permitted
her
to
go
with
tracey
you
crazy
penny
told
him
fiercely
when
he
had
finished
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
ask
me
to
believe
that
tracey
was
a
big
enough
fool
to
leave
the
gun
and
silencer
where
flora
could
get
hold
of
it
and
kill
sprague
last
night
why
not
let
us
suppose
that
tracey
himself
killed
sprague
to
protect
his
wife
not
only
from
scandal
but
from
a
charge
of
murder
dundee
countered
tell
me
honestly
do
you
think
tracey
miles
loves
flora
enough
to
do
that
for
her
suddenly
inexplicably
penny
began
to
laugh
not
hysterically
but
with
genuine
mirth
chapter
what
are
you
laughing
at
dundee
demanded
indignantly
but
the
sustained
ringing
of
the
telephone
bell
checked
penny
crain
mirthful
laughter
my
chicago
call
hello
yes
this
is
dundee
all
right
but
make
it
snappy
wo
you
hello
sanderson
how
is
your
mother
that
fine
i
certainly
hope
yes
the
inquest
is
slated
for
tomorrow
morning
but
there
no
use
your
leaving
your
mother
to
come
back
for
it
yes
sir
one
important
new
development
can
you
hear
me
plainly
then
hold
the
line
a
moment
please
with
the
receiver
still
at
his
ear
dundee
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
no
operator
we
not
through
please
keep
off
the
line
listen
chief
he
addressed
the
district
attorney
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
distance
wire
this
is
a
telegram
captain
strawn
received
this
afternoon
from
the
city
editor
of
the
new
york
evening
press
can
you
hear
me
all
right
and
he
read
slowly
repeating
when
necessary
when
he
had
finished
reading
the
telegram
he
listened
for
a
long
minute
but
not
with
so
much
concentration
that
he
could
not
grin
at
penny
amazement
and
joy
that
what
i
think
sir
he
cried
jubilantly
i
like
to
take
the
five
train
for
new
york
and
work
on
the
case
from
that
end
till
we
actually
get
our
teeth
into
something
thanks
a
lot
and
my
best
wishes
for
your
mother
why
did
you
tell
me
about
this
sammy
penny
demanded
indignantly
tormenting
me
with
your
silly
theory
about
poor
flora
and
tracey
when
all
the
time
you
knew
the
case
was
practically
solved
i
afraid
i
gave
the
district
attorney
a
slightly
false
impression
dundee
interrupted
but
there
was
no
remorse
in
his
shining
blue
eyes
but
just
so
i
get
to
new
york
by
the
way
young
woman
what
you
laughing
at
so
heartily
i
did
know
i
had
made
an
amusing
remark
when
i
asked
you
if
you
thought
tracey
miles
loved
his
wife
well
enough
to
commit
murder
for
her
penny
laughed
again
white
teeth
and
brown
eyes
gleaming
i
was
laughing
at
something
else
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
while
you
were
spinning
your
foolish
theory
how
tracey
would
have
been
if
flora
had
confessed
to
him
saturday
night
that
she
had
killed
nita
because
she
was
jealous
which
was
my
theory
if
you
remember
dundee
retorted
but
why
is
the
idea
so
amusing
deep
in
his
heart
i
suppose
any
man
would
really
be
a
bit
flattered
if
his
wife
loved
him
enough
to
be
that
jealous
you
do
know
tracey
miles
as
well
as
i
do
penny
assured
him
her
eyes
still
mirthful
he
really
a
dear
in
spite
of
being
a
dreadful
bore
most
of
the
time
but
the
truth
is
tracey
has
an
atom
of
sex
appeal
and
he
realize
it
of
course
we
girls
have
all
pampered
his
poor
little
ego
by
pretending
to
be
crazy
about
him
and
terribly
envious
that
it
was
flora
who
got
him
but
flora
hackett
marry
him
dundee
interrupted
she
must
have
been
a
beautiful
girl
and
she
was
certainly
rich
enough
to
get
any
man
she
wanted
you
would
think
so
would
you
penny
agreed
her
tongue
loosened
by
relief
i
was
only
twelve
years
old
when
flora
hackett
made
her
debut
but
a
has
big
ears
and
keen
eyes
it
is
true
that
flora
was
beautiful
and
rich
but
well
there
was
something
queer
about
her
she
was
simply
crazy
to
get
married
and
if
a
man
danced
with
her
as
many
as
three
times
in
an
evening
she
literally
seized
upon
him
and
tried
to
drag
him
to
the
altar
her
eagerness
and
her
intensity
repelled
every
man
who
was
in
the
least
attracted
to
her
and
i
think
she
was
beginning
to
be
frightened
to
death
that
she
would
get
married
at
all
when
she
happened
to
meet
tracey
who
had
just
got
a
job
as
salesman
in
her
father
business
she
began
to
rush
him
there
no
other
word
for
it
and
none
of
the
other
girls
minded
a
bit
because
without
flora
tracey
would
have
been
the
perfect
male
wallflower
they
became
engaged
almost
right
away
and
were
married
six
months
or
so
later
all
the
girls
freely
prophesied
that
even
tracey
flattered
by
her
passion
for
him
as
he
so
evidently
was
would
get
tired
of
it
but
he
did
and
there
were
three
marriages
in
crowd
that
june
three
dundee
repeated
absently
for
his
interest
was
waning
yes
lois
morrow
and
peter
dunlap
johnny
drake
and
carolyn
swann
and
tracey
and
flora
penny
answered
although
i
was
thirteen
then
and
really
too
old
for
the
role
i
had
the
fun
of
being
flower
girl
for
lois
and
flora
both
do
you
think
flora
was
really
in
love
with
tracey
dundee
asked
curiously
oh
yes
but
she
have
been
in
love
with
anyone
who
wanted
to
marry
her
and
the
funny
thing
is
that
with
the
exception
of
peter
and
lois
they
are
the
happiest
married
couple
i
have
ever
known
you
see
tracey
has
never
got
over
being
flattered
that
so
pretty
and
passionate
a
girl
as
flora
hackett
wanted
and
that
why
i
laughed
tracey
with
that
sexual
inferiority
complex
of
his
would
have
been
so
flattered
if
flora
had
told
him
she
killed
nita
out
of
jealousy
that
he
would
have
forgiven
her
on
the
spot
on
the
other
hand
she
went
on
if
flora
had
told
him
that
nita
had
documentary
proofs
of
some
frightful
scandal
against
her
ca
you
see
how
violently
tracey
would
have
reacted
against
her
oh
no
tracey
would
not
have
taken
the
trouble
to
murder
sprague
when
sprague
popped
up
for
more
blackmail
perhaps
he
might
have
if
the
scandal
dated
back
to
before
the
marriage
dundee
argued
let
suppose
sprague
did
pop
up
and
flora
turned
him
over
to
tracey
when
sprague
appeared
apparently
uninvited
last
night
flora
must
have
been
on
pins
and
needles
trying
to
make
tracey
treat
him
decently
and
hoping
against
hope
that
tracey
would
simply
pay
the
scoundrel
all
the
blackmail
he
was
demanding
which
is
exactly
what
tracey
would
have
done
instead
of
taking
the
awful
risk
of
murdering
him
in
his
own
home
penny
cut
in
spiritedly
besides
tracey
was
gone
from
the
porch
long
enough
to
go
outside
signal
to
sprague
in
the
trophy
room
shoot
him
when
sprague
raised
the
screen
and
then
hide
the
gun
i
told
you
tracey
was
gone
only
about
a
minute
when
he
went
to
see
if
sprague
hat
and
stick
were
gone
from
the
closet
did
tracey
and
flora
both
step
outside
to
see
their
guests
into
their
cars
dundee
asked
suddenly
tracey
did
penny
answered
flora
told
us
all
good
night
in
the
living
room
then
ran
upstairs
to
see
if
betty
was
still
asleep
but
remember
we
did
leave
until
midnight
and
price
says
sprague
was
killed
between
nine
and
eleven
last
night
price
would
be
the
first
to
grant
a
leeway
of
an
hour
one
way
or
another
dundee
told
her
of
course
if
tracey
did
kill
him
he
let
flora
believe
that
he
had
given
sprague
the
blackmail
money
he
was
demanding
for
it
is
inconceivable
that
a
woman
of
flora
hysterical
temperament
could
have
slept
even
with
two
sleeping
tablets
knowing
that
a
corpse
was
in
the
house
oh
i
sick
of
your
silly
theorizing
penny
told
him
with
vehement
scorn
listen
here
bonnie
dundee
you
probably
laugh
at
intuition
but
take
it
from
me
on
the
wrong
oh
i
not
so
wedded
to
that
particular
theory
dundee
laughed
i
can
spin
you
exactly
six
more
just
as
convincing
and
i
sha
listen
you
better
dash
home
and
pack
your
bag
if
you
want
to
catch
the
five
train
for
new
york
it
already
packed
and
in
my
office
dundee
assured
her
lazily
got
lots
of
time
hullo
here
the
home
edition
of
evening
he
interrupted
himself
as
a
small
boy
making
his
rounds
of
the
courthouse
flung
the
paper
into
the
office
he
reached
for
it
and
read
the
streamer
headline
aloud
italian
gangster
sought
in
bridge
murders
i
wager
a
good
many
heads
will
lie
easier
on
their
pillows
tonight
let
me
see
penny
commanded
and
snatched
the
paper
unceremoniously
oh
did
you
see
this
and
she
pointed
to
a
boxed
story
in
the
middle
of
the
front
page
parties
cancelled
she
read
aloud
society
editor
of
evening
was
kept
busy
at
her
telephone
today
receiving
notices
of
cancellations
of
bridge
parties
scheduled
for
the
remainder
of
the
week
eight
frantic
hostesses
terrified
by
hamilton
second
murder
at
bridge
oh
that
simply
a
the
newspapers
deliberately
work
up
mob
hysteria
and
then
i
rather
not
play
bridge
for
a
while
myself
dundee
laughed
as
he
rose
and
started
for
his
own
office
and
do
dare
leave
the
room
when
you
become
dummy
if
you
have
the
nerve
to
play
again
remember
that
gun
and
silencer
are
still
missing
what
do
you
mean
you
do
think
there
be
more
dundee
became
instantly
contrite
before
her
terror
i
did
mean
it
honey
he
said
gently
i
think
it
is
more
than
likely
that
the
gun
is
at
the
bottom
of
mirror
lake
but
do
take
care
of
yourself
and
by
that
i
mean
do
work
yourself
to
death
any
messages
for
anyone
in
new
york
penny
pale
face
quivered
if
you
happen
to
run
across
my
father
which
of
course
you
wo
tell
him
that
mother
would
like
him
to
come
home
at
intervals
during
the
run
to
new
york
penny
faltering
words
returned
to
haunt
the
district
attorney
special
investigator
although
he
would
have
preferred
to
devote
his
entire
attention
to
mapping
out
the
program
he
intended
to
follow
when
he
reached
the
city
which
he
fully
believed
had
been
the
scene
of
the
first
act
of
the
tragic
drama
he
was
bent
upon
bringing
to
an
equally
tragic
conclusion
as
soon
as
he
had
registered
at
a
hotel
near
the
pennsylvania
station
and
had
shaved
and
breakfasted
he
took
from
his
bag
a
large
envelope
containing
the
photographs
carraway
had
made
of
penny
alive
and
of
nita
dead
both
clad
in
the
royal
blue
velvet
dress
in
the
envelope
also
was
the
white
satin
label
which
the
dress
had
so
proudly
borne
pierre
model
copied
by
simonson
new
york
city
half
an
hour
later
he
was
showing
the
photographs
and
the
label
to
a
woman
buyer
in
the
french
salon
of
simonson
one
of
new
york
most
exclusive
department
stores
can
you
tell
me
when
the
original
pierre
model
was
bought
and
when
this
copy
was
made
and
sold
he
asked
the
smartly
dressed
buyer
accepted
the
sheaf
of
photographs
bonnie
dundee
was
offering
i
do
my
best
of
course
she
began
briskly
then
paled
and
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
as
her
eyes
took
in
the
topmost
picture
this
is
juanita
leigh
it
but
she
shuddered
how
odd
she
looks
as
if
yes
dundee
agreed
gravely
she
was
dead
when
that
picture
was
taken
did
you
know
mrs
selim
no
the
woman
breathed
her
eyes
still
bulging
with
horror
but
seen
so
many
pictures
of
her
in
the
papers
to
think
that
it
was
one
of
dresses
she
chose
for
her
shroud
but
you
want
to
know
when
the
dress
was
sold
to
her
do
you
she
asked
brisk
again
i
can
find
out
we
keep
a
record
of
all
our
french
originals
and
of
the
number
of
copies
made
of
each
let
me
think
i
been
going
to
paris
myself
for
the
firm
for
the
last
fifteen
years
but
i
ca
remember
buying
this
pierre
model
oh
of
course
i
did
go
over
during
and
on
account
of
the
war
you
know
but
the
big
paris
designers
managed
to
send
us
a
limited
number
of
very
good
models
and
this
must
have
been
one
of
them
otherwise
i
remember
buying
it
if
excuse
me
a
moment
when
she
returned
about
ten
minutes
later
miss
thomas
brought
him
a
pencilled
memorandum
this
pierre
model
was
imported
in
the
summer
of
several
months
in
advance
of
the
winter
season
of
course
only
five
copies
were
made
in
different
colors
and
materials
naturally
since
we
make
a
point
of
exclusiveness
the
royal
blue
velvet
copy
was
sold
to
juanita
leigh
in
january
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
give
you
the
exact
day
of
the
month
but
our
records
show
the
month
only
i
took
the
liberty
of
showing
a
picture
of
the
dress
to
the
only
saleswoman
in
the
department
who
has
been
with
us
that
long
but
she
can
not
remember
the
sale
twelve
years
is
a
long
time
you
know
indeed
it
is
dundee
agreed
regretfully
you
have
been
immensely
helpful
however
miss
thomas
and
i
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
if
you
could
just
tell
confidentially
of
course
miss
thomas
whispered
what
sort
of
clue
this
dress
is
i
do
know
myself
the
detective
admitted
but
he
added
to
himself
after
he
had
escaped
the
buyer
natural
curiosity
i
intend
to
find
out
before
he
could
take
any
further
steps
along
that
particular
path
however
dundee
had
an
appointment
to
keep
upon
arriving
at
his
hotel
that
morning
he
had
made
two
telephone
calls
he
smiled
now
as
he
recalled
the
surprise
and
glee
of
one
of
his
former
yale
classmates
now
a
discouraged
young
bond
salesman
with
whom
he
had
kept
in
touch
you
want
to
borrow
my
name
and
my
kid
sister
jimmy
randolph
had
chortled
hop
to
it
old
sport
but
you
might
tell
me
what
you
want
with
such
intimate
belongings
of
mine
you
may
not
know
it
dundee
had
retorted
but
young
james
wadley
randolph
scion
of
the
famous
old
boston
family
is
going
to
visit
that
equally
famous
school
to
see
whether
it
is
the
ideal
finishing
school
for
his
beloved
young
sister
barbara
she
about
fifteen
now
is
she
jimmy
going
on
sixteen
and
one
of
satan
prize
hellions
jimmy
randolph
had
answered
the
family
would
be
eternally
grateful
if
you
could
get
forsyte
to
take
her
but
make
them
promise
not
to
have
any
more
chorus
girls
who
plan
to
get
murdered
as
directors
of
their
amateur
theatricals
bab
would
be
sure
to
be
mixed
up
in
the
mess
i
suppose
that
the
job
you
on
you
dick
you
the
second
telephone
call
had
secured
an
appointment
at
the
forsyte
school
for
james
wadley
randolph
of
boston
and
dundee
rather
relishing
his
first
need
for
such
professional
tactics
relaxed
to
enjoy
the
drive
along
the
hudson
it
was
a
quarter
to
twelve
when
his
taxi
swept
up
the
drive
toward
the
big
turreted
building
sedately
lonely
in
the
midst
of
its
valuable
acres
miss
earle
says
to
come
to
the
office
a
colored
maid
told
him
when
he
had
given
his
borrowed
name
and
led
him
from
the
vast
hall
to
a
fairly
large
room
whose
windows
looked
upon
a
tennis
court
and
whose
walls
were
almost
covered
with
group
pictures
of
graduating
classes
photographs
of
amateur
theatrical
performances
and
portrait
studies
of
alumnae
a
very
thin
woman
of
about
forty
with
eyes
which
peered
nearsightedly
rose
from
an
desk
and
came
forward
to
greet
him
i
am
miss
earle
miss
pendleton
private
secretary
she
told
him
as
he
shook
her
bony
clammy
hand
i
should
have
told
you
when
you
telephoned
this
morning
that
both
miss
pendleton
and
miss
macon
sailed
for
europe
yesterday
we
always
have
our
commencement
the
last
tuesday
in
may
you
know
but
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
you
i
should
like
to
know
something
at
first
hand
of
the
history
of
the
school
its
well
prestige
special
advantages
curriculum
and
so
on
dundee
began
deprecatingly
i
should
certainly
be
able
to
answer
any
question
you
may
wish
to
ask
randolph
since
i
have
been
with
the
school
for
fifteen
years
miss
earle
interrupted
tartly
then
forsyte
must
take
younger
pupils
than
i
had
been
led
to
believe
miss
earle
dundee
said
with
his
most
winning
smile
i
was
never
a
pupil
here
the
secretary
corrected
him
but
she
thawed
visibly
of
course
i
was
a
mere
child
when
i
finished
business
school
but
i
been
here
fifteen
years
fifteen
years
of
watching
rich
society
girls
dawdle
away
four
or
five
years
just
because
they
got
to
be
before
they
make
their
debut
but
i
must
talk
like
that
or
i
give
you
a
wrong
impression
randolph
of
its
kind
it
is
really
a
very
fine
school
very
exclusive
riding
masters
dancing
masters
a
golf
and
our
own
golf
course
native
teachers
for
french
italian
german
and
spanish
oh
the
is
all
right
and
will
probably
not
suffer
any
loss
of
prestige
on
account
of
that
dreadful
murder
out
in
the
middle
west
murder
dundee
echoed
as
if
he
had
no
idea
what
she
was
talking
about
have
you
been
reading
the
papers
miss
earle
rallied
him
with
a
coquettish
smile
but
i
do
suppose
boston
bothers
with
such
sordid
things
she
added
her
mouth
tightening
miss
pendleton
was
all
cut
up
about
it
because
selim
or
juanita
leigh
as
she
was
known
on
broadway
had
directed
our
easter
play
the
last
two
years
and
the
reporters
simply
hounded
us
the
first
two
days
after
she
was
murdered
out
in
hamilton
where
a
number
of
our
richest
girls
have
come
from
by
jove
dundee
exclaimed
was
the
selim
woman
connected
with
this
school
really
i
only
read
the
headlines
never
pay
much
attention
to
murders
in
the
papers
i
wish
miss
earle
interrupted
tartly
fresh
tears
reddening
her
eyes
that
people
would
persist
in
referring
to
her
as
selim
woman
when
i
think
how
sweet
and
friendly
she
was
how
how
and
to
dundee
surprise
she
choked
on
tears
before
she
could
go
on
of
course
i
know
it
dreadful
for
the
school
and
i
ought
not
to
talk
about
it
when
you
come
to
see
about
putting
your
sister
into
the
school
but
nita
was
and
it
simply
makes
me
you
admired
and
liked
her
very
much
dundee
asked
forgetting
his
role
for
the
moment
yes
i
did
and
miss
pendleton
liked
her
too
and
you
can
imagine
how
clever
and
popular
she
was
when
a
wonderful
woman
like
peter
dunlap
who
was
lois
morrow
when
she
was
in
school
here
admired
her
so
much
she
took
her
to
hamilton
with
her
to
direct
plays
for
a
little
theater
why
i
never
met
anyone
i
was
so
congenial
with
the
secretary
went
on
passionately
the
girls
here
snub
me
and
make
silly
jokes
about
me
behind
my
back
and
call
me
nicknames
but
nita
was
just
as
sweet
to
me
as
she
was
to
anyone
even
miss
pendleton
herself
were
you
with
her
much
dundee
dared
ask
her
much
i
should
say
i
was
she
asserted
proudly
i
have
a
room
here
live
here
the
year
and
both
years
nita
shared
my
room
so
she
would
not
have
to
make
the
long
trip
back
to
new
york
every
night
during
the
last
week
of
rehearsals
we
used
to
talk
until
two
or
three
in
the
morning
say
she
broke
off
in
sudden
terror
you
are
a
reporter
are
you
a
reporter
good
lord
no
dundee
denied
in
all
sincerity
then
he
made
up
his
mind
swiftly
this
woman
hated
the
school
and
all
connected
with
it
had
grown
more
and
more
sour
and
every
year
of
the
fifteen
she
had
served
here
and
she
liked
nita
leigh
selim
better
than
anyone
she
had
ever
met
the
opportunity
for
direct
questioning
was
too
miraculous
to
be
ignored
so
he
changed
his
tone
suddenly
and
said
very
earnestly
no
i
am
not
a
reporter
miss
earle
but
i
am
james
wadley
randolph
jr
i
am
james
dundee
special
investigator
attached
to
the
office
of
the
district
attorney
of
hamilton
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
solve
the
mystery
of
selim
murder
it
took
nearly
ten
precious
minutes
for
dundee
to
nurse
the
terrified
but
obviously
thrilled
woman
over
the
shock
and
to
get
her
into
the
mood
to
answer
him
freely
but
i
sha
and
tell
you
anything
bad
about
nita
she
protested
vehemently
wiping
her
eyes
the
papers
are
all
saying
now
that
she
got
for
some
awful
racketeer
named
sammy
but
i
she
did
get
the
money
that
way
she
was
too
good
from
nita
confidences
to
you
do
you
have
any
idea
how
she
did
get
the
money
dundee
asked
miss
earle
shook
her
head
i
do
know
but
she
got
it
honorably
i
know
that
maybe
she
found
her
husband
and
made
him
pay
alimony
dundee
controlled
his
excitement
with
difficulty
did
she
tell
you
all
about
her
marriage
and
divorce
again
miss
earle
shook
her
head
the
only
time
she
ever
spoke
of
it
was
last
year
the
first
year
she
directed
our
play
you
know
i
asked
her
why
she
did
get
married
again
and
she
said
she
could
she
divorced
because
she
did
know
where
her
husband
was
and
it
was
too
expensive
to
go
to
reno
of
course
she
may
have
found
him
or
something
and
got
a
divorce
some
time
this
last
year
and
this
money
she
got
was
a
settlement
she
must
have
got
a
divorce
since
she
was
planning
to
be
married
again
to
a
young
man
in
hamilton
dundee
assured
her
soothingly
the
way
everybody
puts
the
very
worst
interpretation
on
everything
when
a
person
gets
murdered
miss
earle
stormed
if
poor
nita
had
belonged
to
a
rich
family
like
the
girls
here
they
would
have
spent
a
million
if
necessary
to
hush
up
any
scandal
on
her
i
seen
it
done
she
added
darkly
and
venomously
chapter
bonnie
dundee
heart
leaped
but
he
forced
himself
to
go
softly
i
suppose
he
said
casually
a
fashionable
school
like
this
has
plenty
of
carefully
scandals
i
say
it
has
miss
earle
retorted
inelegantly
and
with
ghoulish
satisfaction
can
do
anything
it
makes
my
blood
simply
boil
when
i
think
of
how
those
forsyte
girls
in
hamilton
so
smug
and
snobbish
in
their
hick
town
must
be
running
poor
nita
down
now
that
she
dead
and
ca
defend
herself
if
the
truth
were
only
known
about
some
of
dundee
could
almost
have
embraced
the
homely
spinster
she
was
making
his
task
so
easy
for
him
i
met
them
all
of
course
since
selim
was
murdered
he
said
deprecatingly
and
i
must
say
they
seem
to
be
remarkably
fine
women
and
girls
oh
they
miss
earle
snorted
flora
hackett
tracey
miles
she
is
now
did
happen
to
tell
you
the
nice
little
fuss
kicked
up
when
she
was
here
did
she
oh
no
i
guess
not
she
looks
dundee
agreed
like
a
girl
who
would
have
made
things
lively
i
say
so
miss
pendleton
nearly
had
nervous
prostration
miss
earle
plunged
on
then
fear
blanched
her
face
for
a
moment
you
know
promised
you
never
tell
miss
pendleton
or
miss
macon
that
you
talked
to
me
you
can
depend
on
it
that
i
will
protect
you
dundee
assured
her
when
did
flora
hackett
kick
up
her
little
fuss
let
see
flora
graduated
in
june
miss
earle
obliged
willingly
so
it
must
have
been
in
yes
because
she
had
one
more
year
here
of
course
they
let
her
come
back
she
took
the
lead
in
our
annual
easter
play
in
and
just
because
serena
hart
complimented
her
and
told
her
she
was
almost
as
good
as
a
professional
hart
dundee
wonderingly
repeated
the
name
of
one
of
america
most
popular
and
beloved
stage
stars
yes
serena
hart
miss
earle
repeated
proudly
she
was
a
forsyte
girl
too
and
of
course
she
go
into
the
chorus
herself
after
she
graduated
in
let
see
because
it
was
the
second
year
after
come
to
work
here
and
miss
pendleton
nearly
died
because
she
was
afraid
forsyte
precious
prestige
would
be
lowered
but
when
serena
became
a
star
everything
was
grand
of
course
and
forsyte
was
proud
to
claim
her
anyway
serena
comes
to
the
easter
play
every
year
she
can
if
she
is
in
a
broadway
play
herself
of
course
and
so
she
saw
flora
acting
in
the
easter
play
in
and
told
her
she
was
awfully
good
she
was
too
but
not
half
the
actress
that
little
penny
crain
was
when
she
had
the
lead
in
the
play
four
or
five
years
ago
dundee
heart
begged
him
to
ask
for
more
details
of
penny
triumph
but
his
job
demanded
that
he
keep
the
now
miss
earle
to
the
business
in
hand
and
flora
hackett
he
prompted
well
the
next
day
after
the
play
the
easter
vacation
began
you
know
and
flora
a
letter
from
her
father
giving
her
permission
to
spend
the
easter
holiday
with
one
of
the
girls
who
lived
in
atlanta
miss
earle
continued
with
great
relish
well
sir
right
in
the
middle
of
the
holidays
here
came
her
father
and
mother
they
were
both
alive
then
and
asked
for
flora
they
wired
the
girl
in
atlanta
and
flora
was
there
and
the
hacketts
were
nearly
crazy
but
as
luck
would
have
it
hackett
ran
into
a
friend
of
theirs
on
broadway
and
this
friend
began
to
tease
hackett
about
his
daughter
being
a
chorus
girl
a
chorus
girl
dundee
echoed
taking
care
not
to
show
his
disappointment
of
course
they
nabbed
her
right
out
of
the
show
but
that
was
the
worst
of
it
miss
earle
went
on
dramatically
and
mysteriously
they
tried
to
hush
it
up
of
course
but
the
word
went
through
the
school
like
wildfire
that
flora
was
only
in
the
chorus
but
that
she
was
with
an
she
been
writing
fan
letters
to
long
before
the
easter
play
went
on
did
you
hear
his
name
dundee
asked
no
miss
earle
acknowledged
regretfully
but
i
bet
anything
it
was
the
truth
why
flora
hackett
was
so
she
flirted
scandalously
with
every
male
teacher
in
the
school
the
golf
we
had
then
got
so
scared
of
her
he
quit
his
job
i
suppose
dundee
prompted
craftily
she
was
any
worse
than
some
of
the
other
hamilton
girls
miss
earle
admitted
reluctantly
nothing
ever
on
any
of
the
others
but
it
looked
mighty
funny
to
me
when
janet
mother
took
her
out
of
school
right
in
the
middle
of
a
term
and
hauled
her
off
to
europe
a
whole
i
guess
she
suggested
with
raised
eyebrows
you
know
what
it
means
when
a
girl
has
to
spend
a
whole
year
abroad
and
her
mother
says
she
taking
her
away
for
her
health
and
janet
looking
as
healthy
as
any
other
girl
in
the
school
except
that
she
was
crying
half
the
time
and
smuggling
special
delivery
letters
in
and
out
by
one
of
the
maids
did
you
tell
nita
these
stories
and
point
out
the
pictures
of
the
girls
dundee
had
to
risk
asking
miss
earle
froze
instantly
naturally
she
was
interested
in
the
school
and
once
when
she
said
it
always
made
her
mad
the
way
chorus
girls
were
run
down
i
told
her
that
in
my
opinion
society
girls
were
worse
than
actresses
and
well
of
course
i
gave
her
some
examples
a
lot
of
them
worse
than
anything
i
told
you
about
flora
hackett
and
janet
raymond
i
hope
she
added
viciously
that
nita
dropped
a
hint
or
two
if
flora
or
janet
had
the
nerve
to
her
when
she
was
in
hamilton
perhaps
she
did
dundee
agreed
softly
by
the
way
how
did
nita
happen
to
get
the
job
here
of
directing
the
easter
plays
that
what
the
reporters
wanted
to
know
miss
earle
smiled
but
miss
pendleton
would
tell
them
for
fear
serena
would
like
it
and
maybe
be
drawn
into
the
scandal
when
everybody
knows
she
as
straight
as
a
string
did
serena
hart
get
her
the
job
dundee
was
amazed
yes
wait
i
show
you
the
letter
of
recommendation
she
wrote
for
nita
to
miss
pendleton
miss
earle
offered
eagerly
remember
now
you
not
to
tell
on
me
she
went
to
a
tall
walnut
filing
cabinet
and
quickly
returned
with
a
note
which
she
thrust
into
dundee
willing
hands
he
read
dear
miss
pendleton
the
bearer
juanita
leigh
is
rather
badly
in
need
of
a
job
and
i
have
suggested
that
she
apply
to
you
for
a
chance
to
direct
the
easter
play
i
have
known
miss
leigh
personally
for
ten
years
and
have
the
highest
regard
both
for
her
character
and
for
her
ability
since
you
usually
stage
musical
comedies
i
think
miss
leigh
who
has
been
a
specialty
dancer
as
well
as
an
actress
in
musical
comedy
for
about
twelve
years
would
be
admirably
suited
for
the
work
knowing
my
love
for
forsyte
as
you
do
i
do
not
have
to
assure
you
that
i
would
suggest
nothing
which
would
be
detrimental
to
the
school
best
interests
fondly
yours
serena
hart
she
was
wrong
there
but
i
know
it
was
nita
fault
miss
earle
who
had
been
looking
over
his
shoulder
commented
upon
the
last
sentence
of
the
letter
is
miss
hart
appearing
in
a
play
now
dundee
asked
no
but
she
rehearsing
in
one
which
will
open
at
the
warburton
theater
next
monday
night
the
secretary
answered
at
commencement
tuesday
night
serena
told
miss
pendleton
how
awfully
sorry
she
was
about
nita
and
gave
me
tickets
for
the
opening
you
go
to
see
her
but
do
tell
her
told
you
anything
i
know
rehearsing
at
the
theater
this
afternoon
because
she
said
she
would
be
all
week
and
could
go
to
the
boat
to
see
miss
pendleton
and
miss
macon
off
for
europe
i
will
dundee
accepted
the
suggestion
gratefully
as
if
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
but
first
i
want
you
to
come
out
to
lunch
with
me
sure
you
know
of
some
nice
tearoom
or
roadhouse
in
the
neighborhood
during
the
luncheon
which
miss
earle
devoured
avidly
without
its
interfering
with
her
flow
of
reminiscences
concerning
the
girls
she
hated
dundee
was
able
to
learn
nothing
more
to
the
detriment
of
forsyte
hamilton
alumnae
but
he
did
add
considerably
to
his
knowledge
and
pity
of
female
human
nature
it
was
nearly
three
when
he
presented
his
card
with
a
message
pencilled
upon
its
back
to
the
aged
doorkeeper
who
drowsed
in
the
alley
which
led
to
the
stage
entrance
of
the
warburton
theater
just
off
broadway
near
times
square
and
fifteen
minutes
later
he
was
being
received
in
the
star
by
serena
hart
herself
you
working
on
poor
nita
murder
she
began
without
preamble
as
she
seated
herself
at
her
and
indicated
a
decrepit
chair
for
the
detective
i
was
wondering
how
much
longer
i
could
keep
out
of
it
of
course
you
been
pumping
that
poor
foolish
virgin
gladys
earle
why
girls
who
look
like
that
are
always
called
god
i
tired
we
been
at
it
since
ten
this
morning
but
thank
the
lord
we
through
now
for
the
day
dundee
studied
her
with
keen
interest
and
decided
that
almost
plain
though
she
was
she
was
even
more
magnetic
than
when
seen
from
the
footlights
rather
carelessly
dressed
long
brown
hair
rather
tousled
her
face
very
pale
and
haggard
without
the
which
would
give
it
radiance
on
monday
night
serena
hart
was
nevertheless
one
of
the
most
attractive
women
dundee
had
ever
met
and
one
of
the
kindest
he
felt
suddenly
sure
when
did
i
first
meet
nita
leigh
she
repeated
his
question
let
me
think
oh
yes
the
first
year
after
i
went
on
the
stage
we
were
in
the
chorus
together
in
tilly
a
rotten
show
by
the
way
the
other
girls
of
the
chorus
were
awfully
snooty
to
me
because
i
was
that
anathema
a
girl
but
nita
was
a
darling
she
showed
me
the
ropes
and
we
became
quite
intimate
around
the
theater
only
however
since
my
parents
kept
an
awfully
strict
eye
on
me
the
show
was
a
great
hit
ran
on
into
till
february
or
march
i
believe
then
do
you
know
miss
hart
whether
nita
got
married
during
the
winter
dundee
asked
why
yes
she
did
serena
hart
answered
her
brow
clearing
after
a
frown
of
concentration
i
ca
remember
exactly
when
but
it
was
before
the
show
closed
certainly
a
few
weeks
before
because
the
poor
child
was
a
deserted
bride
days
before
the
closing
notice
was
posted
deserted
dundee
exclaimed
did
you
meet
her
husband
miss
hart
no
serena
hart
replied
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
told
me
extraordinarily
little
about
him
and
did
not
discuss
her
marriage
with
the
other
girls
of
the
chorus
at
all
i
got
the
impression
that
selim
mat
she
called
him
wanted
it
kept
secret
for
a
while
but
i
do
know
why
this
was
early
in
as
i
told
you
though
i
have
no
way
of
fixing
even
the
approximate
date
and
new
york
was
full
of
soldiers
i
remember
i
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
nita
had
succumbed
to
a
war
romance
but
i
do
think
she
said
anything
to
confirm
my
suspicion
when
did
she
tell
you
of
her
marriage
that
is
when
in
relation
to
the
date
of
the
wedding
itself
dundee
asked
the
very
day
she
was
married
serena
hart
answered
she
was
late
for
the
matinee
our
were
side
by
side
and
as
she
slipped
out
of
her
dress
this
dress
dundee
asked
and
handed
her
the
photograph
of
dead
nita
in
the
royal
blue
velvet
dress
she
had
kept
for
twelve
years
yes
and
serena
hart
shuddered
and
her
hair
was
dressed
like
that
too
although
she
had
been
wearing
it
in
long
curls
and
had
to
take
it
down
before
she
would
go
on
for
the
opening
number
she
whispered
to
me
that
she
had
been
married
that
day
that
she
was
terribly
happy
very
much
in
love
and
that
her
husband
had
asked
her
to
dress
her
hair
in
the
french
roll
a
favorite
with
him
between
numbers
she
whispered
to
me
again
telling
me
that
her
husband
was
different
a
lamb
totally
unlike
any
man
she
had
met
on
broadway
poor
child
for
she
was
a
child
still
only
twenty
but
she
had
been
in
the
business
since
she
was
a
motherless
fatherless
little
drifter
of
sixteen
no
she
did
not
tell
me
how
old
he
was
where
he
came
from
his
business
or
what
he
looked
like
and
i
did
not
inquire
as
the
days
passed
weeks
probably
she
became
more
and
more
silent
and
reserved
though
once
or
twice
she
protested
she
was
still
happy
then
came
a
day
when
she
did
not
show
up
for
the
performance
at
all
the
next
night
she
told
me
in
just
a
few
words
that
her
husband
had
left
her
after
a
quarrel
and
had
not
returned
it
seems
that
she
had
innocently
told
him
how
she
had
benny
steinfeld
the
big
revue
producer
you
know
into
giving
her
a
in
his
summer
show
and
that
her
had
flown
into
a
rage
accusing
her
of
having
been
untrue
to
him
she
never
mentioned
his
desertion
to
me
again
but
yes
dundee
prompted
well
serena
hart
went
on
uncomfortably
i
afraid
i
rather
forgot
poor
nita
after
tilly
closed
for
my
next
work
was
in
stock
in
des
moines
after
a
year
of
stock
i
got
my
chance
in
a
legitimate
show
on
broadway
and
one
day
i
met
her
on
the
street
not
having
much
to
talk
with
her
about
i
asked
her
if
she
and
her
husband
were
reconciled
she
said
no
that
she
had
never
seen
him
again
then
in
a
burst
of
confidence
she
told
me
that
she
had
hired
a
private
detective
out
of
her
meager
earnings
to
investigate
him
in
his
home
town
or
rather
the
city
he
had
told
her
he
came
from
the
detective
had
reported
that
no
such
person
as
mat
or
matthew
selim
had
ever
lived
there
so
far
as
he
could
find
out
i
asked
her
if
she
was
going
to
get
a
divorce
and
she
said
she
was
not
that
being
already
married
was
a
protection
against
getting
married
in
haste
again
after
that
i
rather
lost
sight
of
nita
and
practically
forgot
her
our
paths
being
so
very
divergent
and
you
never
saw
her
again
dundee
asked
very
much
disappointed
oh
yes
two
or
three
times
at
openings
or
on
the
street
but
we
never
held
any
significant
conversation
serena
hart
answered
reaching
for
her
plain
rather
dowdy
little
hat
wait
i
was
about
to
forget
i
had
quite
a
shock
in
connection
with
nita
one
afternoon
let
see
that
was
when
i
opened
in
in
which
i
made
my
first
real
success
you
know
i
bought
new
york
evening
which
devotes
considerable
space
to
theatrical
doings
to
see
what
sort
of
review
the
show
had
got
and
on
the
first
page
i
saw
a
picture
of
nita
beneath
a
headline
which
said
model
commits
suicide
what
dundee
exclaimed
astounded
oh
it
was
nita
leigh
serena
hart
reassured
him
there
was
a
correction
the
next
day
you
see
an
artists
model
named
anita
lee
spelled
instead
of
had
committed
suicide
and
as
the
explained
it
the
next
day
the
similarity
of
both
the
first
name
and
the
last
had
caused
the
error
in
getting
a
photograph
from
the
to
accompany
the
story
there
was
a
picture
of
nita
leigh
with
nita
statement
that
report
of
my
death
has
been
exaggerated
and
a
picture
of
the
real
anita
lee
when
did
the
mistake
occur
dundee
asked
in
great
excitement
let
me
think
serena
hart
frowned
opened
in
yes
about
the
first
of
may
just
a
little
more
than
eight
years
ago
dundee
reached
for
his
own
hat
in
a
fever
to
be
gone
but
to
his
surprise
the
actress
stopped
him
a
faint
color
in
her
pale
cheeks
since
you
from
hamilton
and
are
investigating
the
murder
you
have
undoubtedly
met
little
penelope
crain
i
know
her
very
well
it
happens
that
she
is
private
secretary
to
the
district
attorney
under
whom
i
work
why
i
saw
her
play
the
lead
in
the
easter
show
at
forsyte
four
or
five
years
ago
miss
hart
explained
her
face
turned
from
the
detective
as
she
dusted
it
with
powder
and
i
was
impressed
with
her
talent
in
fact
i
advised
her
father
who
had
come
from
hamilton
to
witness
the
performance
as
proud
parents
are
likely
to
do
to
let
her
go
on
the
stage
so
you
met
roger
crain
dundee
paused
to
ask
oh
yes
a
charming
man
with
even
more
personality
than
his
daughter
the
actress
answered
carelessly
so
carelessly
that
dundee
had
a
sudden
hunch
have
you
seen
crain
recently
he
deserted
his
family
and
fled
hamilton
under
rather
unsavory
circumstances
what
do
you
mean
miss
hart
asked
sharply
oh
there
was
nothing
actually
criminal
i
suppose
but
he
is
believed
to
have
withheld
some
securities
which
would
have
helped
satisfy
his
creditors
when
bankruptcy
was
imminent
dundee
explained
have
you
seen
him
since
then
january
it
was
i
believe
january
miss
hart
appeared
to
need
time
for
reflection
oh
yes
he
sent
in
his
card
on
the
night
of
my
show
that
opened
in
january
it
was
a
flop
lasted
only
five
weeks
we
chatted
of
the
forsyte
girls
who
are
now
in
hamilton
most
of
whom
i
went
to
school
with
or
have
met
at
the
easter
plays
do
you
know
where
crain
is
now
dundee
asked
i
have
a
message
for
him
from
penny
if
you
should
happen
to
see
him
again
why
i
see
him
again
miss
hart
shrugged
and
i
have
the
least
idea
where
he
is
living
or
what
he
is
doing
now
of
course
if
he
should
come
to
see
me
backstage
after
opens
what
is
the
message
from
penny
that
her
mother
wants
him
to
come
home
dundee
answered
and
i
am
very
sure
penny
wants
him
back
too
the
mother
is
one
of
the
sweetest
gentlest
most
tragic
women
i
have
ever
met
and
you
have
seen
penny
for
yourself
the
disgrace
has
been
very
hard
on
them
it
would
be
splendid
if
roger
crain
would
come
back
and
redeem
himself
half
an
hour
later
bonnie
dundee
in
the
file
room
of
new
york
evening
was
in
possession
of
the
bound
volume
of
that
newspaper
for
the
month
of
may
on
the
front
page
of
the
issue
of
may
under
the
caption
which
serena
hart
had
quoted
so
accurately
was
a
picture
of
a
young
laughing
nita
leigh
her
curls
bobbed
short
a
rose
between
her
gleaming
teeth
and
in
the
issue
of
may
appeared
two
pictures
side
by
side
exotic
anita
lee
who
had
found
life
so
insupportable
that
she
had
ended
it
and
the
same
photograph
of
living
vital
nita
leigh
when
he
returned
the
files
he
asked
the
girl
in
charge
does
this
copyright
line
beneath
this
picture
and
he
pointed
to
the
photograph
of
nita
which
had
appeared
erroneously
mean
that
the
picture
was
syndicated
the
girl
bent
her
head
to
see
by
metropolitan
picture
service
she
read
aloud
yes
that
what
it
means
when
evening
was
owned
by
magnus
he
formed
a
separate
company
called
the
metropolitan
picture
service
which
supplied
papers
all
over
the
country
with
a
daily
picture
service
in
mat
form
but
the
picture
syndicate
was
discontinued
about
five
years
ago
when
the
paper
was
sold
to
its
present
owners
are
their
files
available
dundee
asked
if
they
are
i
do
know
anything
about
it
the
girl
told
him
and
turned
to
another
seeker
after
bound
volumes
of
the
paper
it
does
matter
dundee
assured
her
and
asked
for
a
sheet
of
blank
paper
on
which
he
quickly
composed
the
following
telegram
addressed
to
penny
crain
please

stop
wire

in
his
hotel
while
impatiently
awaiting
an
answer
from
penny
dundee
passed
the
time
by
scanning
all
the
new
york
papers
of
thursday
and
friday
on
the
chance
of
meeting
with
significant
revelations
concerning
the
private
life
of
dexter
sprague
or
juanita
leigh
selim
united
by
death
in
the
press
at
least
there
was
much
space
devoted
to
the
theory
involving
the
two
new
yorkers
with
the
murder
of
the
racketeer
and
gambler
sammy
savelli
but
only
two
pieces
of
information
held
dundee
interest
the
first
was
a
reminder
to
the
public
that
certain
theatrical
columns
of
sunday
february
had
carried
the
rumor
of
dexter
engagement
to
dolly
martin
popular
baby
star
of
altamont
pictures
and
that
the
same
columns
of
tuesday
february
had
carried
own
denial
of
the
engagement
dolly
having
nothing
to
say
so
that
is
why
nita
tried
to
commit
suicide
on
february
and
her
attempted
suicide
with
its
tragic
consequences
for
lydia
carr
is
probably
the
reason
sprague
gave
up
his
movie
star
dundee
mused
did
nita
let
him
persuade
her
to
go
into
the
blackmail
business
in
order
to
hold
his
wandering
mercenary
affections
lord
the
men
some
women
love
the
second
bit
of
information
which
the
papers
supplied
him
was
winnowed
by
dundee
himself
from
a
news
summary
of
nita
leigh
last
year
of
life
as
chorus
girl
specialty
dancer
double
in
pictures
and
director
of
the
easter
play
at
if
nita
got
a
divorce
or
even
a
legal
separation
from
her
husband
after
her
talk
with
gladys
earle
a
year
ago
she
got
it
in
new
york
and
so
secretly
that
no
new
york
paper
has
been
able
to
dig
it
up
dundee
concluded
yet
she
had
promised
to
marry
ralph
hammond
a
bellboy
with
a
telegram
interrupted
the
startling
new
train
of
thought
which
that
conclusion
had
started
chapter
with
a
sharp
exclamation
of
excitement
and
triumph
dundee
read
telegram
hamilton
evening
sun
date
of
may
fifth
nineteen
twenty

published
story
of
suicide
anita
lee
artists
model
but
picture
accompanying
was
undoubtedly
nita
leigh
selim
stop
no
correction
followed
stop
what
does
it
mean
what
does
it
mean
dundee
repeated
exultantly
to
himself
it
means
my
darling
little
penny
that
in
hamilton
who
had
any
interest
in
the
matter
believed
nita
leigh
selim
was
dead
and
thought
the
spelling
of
her
name
was
wrong
not
the
picture
the
question
is
read
that
story
and
gazed
on
that
picture
with
exquisite
relief
two
hours
before
he
had
dismissed
as
impossible
or
highly
impractical
his
impulse
to
investigate
the
scandal
on
flora
hackett
who
was
now
flora
miles
as
told
him
by
gladys
earle
of
the
forsyte
school
even
more
difficult
would
it
be
to
find
out
why
janet
mother
had
taken
her
abroad
for
a
year
of
course
he
had
ruefully
told
himself
nita
leigh
might
have
been
lucky
or
unlucky
enough
to
run
across
documentary
proof
of
one
of
the
scandals
of
which
gladys
earle
had
told
her
or
had
dared
to
blackmail
her
victim
by
dark
hints
as
miss
earle
had
unconsciously
suggested
to
her
but
this
new
development
could
not
be
ignored
a
picture
of
nita
leigh
as
a
suicide
had
appeared
eight
years
ago
in
a
hamilton
paper
and
the
paper
had
either
remained
unaware
of
the
error
or
had
thought
it
not
worth
the
space
for
a
correction
years
ago
eight
years
ago
in
june
three
weddings
had
occurred
in
hamilton
the
dunlap
the
miles
the
drake
wedding
and
within
the
last
year
and
a
half
judge
marshall
after
proposing
season
after
season
to
the
most
popular
debutante
had
married
lovely
little
karen
plummer
suddenly
a
sentence
from
ralph
hammond
story
of
his
engagement
to
nita
leigh
selim
popped
up
in
dundee
memory
and
once
i
got
because
i
thought
she
might
still
be
married
but
she
said
her
husband
had
married
again
and
i
was
to
ask
questions
or
worry
about
him
if
ralph
hammond
had
reported
nita
accurately
she
had
not
said
she
was
she
had
merely
said
her
husband
was
why
was
ralph
to
ask
no
questions
divorced
wives
were
not
usually
so
reticent
had
nita
planned
to
commit
the
crime
of
bigamy
if
not
when
and
where
and
how
had
she
secured
a
divorce
to
serena
hart
years
before
she
had
denied
any
intention
of
getting
a
divorce
for
two
reasons
she
did
not
know
where
her
husband
and
because
being
married
although
husbandless
was
a
protection
against
matrimonial
temptations
to
gladys
earle
a
year
ago
in
april
she
had
confided
that
she
could
not
marry
again
because
she
was
not
divorced
and
because
she
did
not
know
the
whereabouts
of
her
husband
and
so
far
as
new
york
reporters
had
been
able
to
find
out
nita
leigh
had
done
nothing
to
alter
her
status
as
a
married
woman
during
the
past
year
moreover
if
nita
had
secured
either
a
divorce
or
a
legal
separation
her
faithful
and
beloved
maid
lydia
carr
would
certainly
have
known
of
it
and
lydia
had
vehemently
protested
more
than
once
to
bonnie
dundee
that
she
knew
nothing
of
nita
husband
although
she
had
worked
for
the
musical
comedy
dancer
for
five
years
surely
if
nita
loving
and
trusting
lydia
as
she
did
had
entered
into
negotiations
of
any
kind
with
or
concerning
her
husband
during
the
last
year
her
maid
would
have
been
the
first
to
know
of
them
and
yet
suddenly
dundee
jumped
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
of
his
hotel
bedroom
he
was
remembering
the
belated
confidence
that
john
drake
banker
had
made
to
him
the
morning
before
after
the
discovery
of
dexter
sprague
murder
he
recalled
drake
reluctant
statement
almost
word
for
word
about
that
which
nita
deposited
with
our
bank
dundee
when
she
made
the
first
deposit
of
on
april
she
explained
it
with
an
embarrassed
laugh
as
alimony
an
instalment
of
which
she
had
succeeded
in
collecting
from
her
former
husband
and
naturally
when
she
made
the
second
deposit
on
may
i
presumed
the
same
explanation
covered
that
sum
too
though
i
confess
i
was
puzzled
by
the
fact
that
both
big
deposits
had
been
made
in
cash
cash
had
nita
by
any
chance
been
telling
a
had
she
been
blackmailing
her
own
husband
a
husband
who
had
dared
marry
again
believing
his
deserted
wife
to
be
dead
and
justifying
herself
by
calling
it
back
alimony
but
was
it
in
reality
no
matter
what
coercion
nita
had
used
in
getting
the
money
exactly
that
alimony
and
the
price
of
her
silence
before
the
world
and
the
wife
who
was
not
really
a
wife
in
a
new
light
bonnie
dundee
studied
the
character
of
the
woman
who
had
been
murdered
possibly
to
make
her
silence
eternal
lois
dunlap
had
liked
even
loved
her
the
other
women
and
girls
of
the
crowd
that
exclusive
clique
of
hamilton
most
socially
prominent
women
must
have
liked
her
fairly
well
and
found
her
congenial
in
spite
of
their
jealousy
of
her
popularity
with
the
men
of
the
crowd
or
they
would
not
have
tolerated
her
regardless
of
lois
dunlap
championship
of
her
protegée
gladys
earle
had
found
her
the
sweetest
kindest
most
generous
person
i
ever
met
gladys
earle
who
envied
and
hated
all
girls
who
were
more
fortunate
than
she
serena
hart
former
member
of
new
york
junior
league
and
still
listed
in
the
social
register
had
found
her
the
only
congenial
member
of
the
chorus
she
had
invaded
as
the
first
step
toward
stardom
and
serena
hart
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
woman
of
character
and
judgment
a
kind
and
wise
and
great
woman
finally
ralph
hammond
had
loved
nita
and
wanted
to
marry
her
was
it
possible
that
nita
selim
only
crime
into
which
she
had
been
led
by
her
infatuation
for
dexter
sprague
had
been
to
demand
secretly
financial
compensation
from
a
husband
who
had
married
and
deserted
her
a
husband
who
believing
her
dead
had
married
again
but
who
was
the
man
whose
picture
to
spin
a
new
theory
nita
had
recognized
as
that
of
her
husband
among
the
male
members
of
the
cast
of
the
beggar
opera
when
lois
dunlap
had
proudly
exhibited
the
stills
of
that
amateur
performance
with
excitement
hammering
at
his
pulses
dundee
took
the
bunch
of
photographs
which
lois
dunlap
had
willingly
given
him
and
studied
the
picture
that
contained
the
entire
cast
the
picture
which
had
first
attracted
nita
attention
and
again
despair
overwhelmed
him
for
every
one
of
his
possible
male
suspects
was
in
that
group
but
he
could
not
keep
his
thoughts
from
racing
on
men
who
stepped
out
of
their
class
and
went
on
parties
with
chorus
girls
frequently
did
so
under
assumed
names
he
reflected
serena
hart
was
authority
for
the
information
that
nita
had
been
a
sudden
marriage
was
it
not
entirely
possible
that
the
man
who
married
nita
in
had
done
so
both
on
liquor
and
infatuation
and
that
he
had
not
troubled
to
explain
to
nita
his
motives
for
having
used
an
assumed
name
or
to
write
in
his
real
name
on
the
application
for
a
marriage
license
had
nita
private
detective
journeyed
out
to
years
ago
in
a
fruitless
attempt
to
locate
matthew
selim
bonnie
dundee
lay
awake
for
hours
friday
night
turning
these
and
a
hundred
other
questions
over
and
over
in
his
mind
and
slept
at
last
only
to
awake
saturday
with
a
plan
of
procedure
which
he
was
sensible
enough
to
realize
promised
small
chance
of
success
and
he
was
right
not
in
manhattan
or
in
any
of
the
other
boroughs
of
new
york
city
did
he
find
any
record
of
a
marriage
license
issued
to
juanita
leigh
and
matthew
selim
not
only
was
it
entirely
probable
that
juanita
leigh
was
a
stage
name
and
that
nita
had
married
conscientiously
under
her
real
name
but
it
was
equally
possible
that
the
license
had
been
secured
in
new
jersey
or
connecticut
when
he
gave
up
his
quest
at
noon
saturday
and
returned
to
his
hotel
dundee
bought
at
the
newsstand
a
paper
whose
headline
convinced
him
that
sergeant
turner
was
at
that
moment
even
more
discouraged
than
himself
for
the
big
type
told
the
world
joe

informed

acknowledged
that
joe
savelli
after
giving
himself
up
with
a
revolver
in
his
hand
had
disclaimed
any
knowledge
of
or
connection
with
the
murders
of
juanita
leigh
selim
and
dexter
sprague
two
hours
later
dundee
received
a
long
telegram
from
district
attorney

have
you
made

stop
have
informed

you
working

of
solving
both
cases
stop
would
like
you
here
for
adjourned
inquests
on
both
murders
monday
stop
mother
improved
am
on
job
again
since
dundee
felt
that
there
was
little
chance
of
following
through
either
on
the
scandals
which
gladys
earle
had
hinted
at
or
on
strangely
secret
marriage
of
twelve
years
before
he
immediately
dispatched
a
wire
to
sanderson
assuring
him
that
vital
progress
had
been
made
and
that
he
would
leave
new
york
on
the
four
train
west
arriving
in
hamilton
sunday
morning
at
the
concluding
sentence
of
the
wire
was
suggest
you
pacify
press
with
only
vaguest
of
hints
sanderson
wire
with
its
confession
of
an
interview
on
dundee
trip
to
new
york
had
upset
him
and
left
him
with
a
cold
sick
feeling
of
fear
that
stumbling
half
in
darkness
the
district
attorney
had
unwittingly
warned
the
murderer
of
nita
selim
and
dexter
sprague
that
his
special
investigator
was
on
the
right
track
but
he
consoled
himself
with
the
hope
that
the
final
sentence
of
his
answering
telegram
would
prevent
any
further
damage
but
he
was
wrong
an
hour
before
he
reached
his
destination
on
sunday
morning
he
went
into
the
dining
car
and
found
a
copy
of
hamilton
morning
beside
his
plate
and
on
the
front
page
was
a
photograph
of
dead
nita
her
black
hair
in
a
french
roll
her
slim
recumbent
body
clad
in
the
royal
blue
velvet
dress
beneath
the
picture
was
the
caption
what
part
does
the
outmoded
royal
blue
velvet
dress
which
nita
selim
chose
as
a
shroud
play
in
the
solution
of
her
murder
that
is
the
question
which
special
investigator
dundee
attached
to
the
district
attorney
office
who
is
due
home
this
morning
from
fruitful
detective
work
in
new
york
is
undoubtedly
prepared
to
answer
dundee
was
still
seething
with
futile
rage
when
he
climbed
the
stairs
to
his
apartment
on
the
floor
just
inside
his
living
room
door
he
found
an
envelope
unstamped

for

a

grin
at
his
anonymous

just
twisting
his

when
a
double

sounded
on
the

a

dundee
suggested

to
the

which
stood
within

of
his
big
armchair
him
belle
snorted

how

dundee
cut
in
irritably
for
he
was
tired
of

and
angry
that

lay
down
whar
i
foun
belle
retorted
mournfulness
submerged
in
anger
dundee
looked
about
the
room
then
his
eyes
alighted
upon
the
missing
book
lying
upon
a
shelf
that
extended
across
the
top
of
an
register
set
high
in
the
wall
between
the
two
windows
the
thick
red
volume
lay
close
against
the
wall
its
rib
facing
the
room
belle
tell
me
the
truth
and
i
shall
not
be
angry
did
you
put
that
red
book
on
that
shelf
dundee
asked
his
voice
steady
and
kindly
in
spite
of
his
excitement
nossuh
i
ai
teched
it
and
you
did
not
put
the
cover
over
my
parrot
cage
although
i
had
tipped
you
well
to
feed
and
cover
him
at
night
dundee
said
severely
i
got
ta
heap
o
wuk
to
do
and
you
say
that
wilson
one
of
the
two
young
men
on
the
second
floor
left
the
front
door
unlocked
when
he
came
in
last
night
dundee
asked
does
he
admit
it
yassuh
belle
told
him
sulkily
he
say
he
was
tiahed
when
he
got
home
midnight
an
he
clean
to
turn
de
key
in
de
do
shoot
de
bolt
thanks
belle
that
will
be
all
now
and
dundee
did
a
great
deal
to
dispel
the
chambermaid
gloom
by
presenting
her
with
a
dollar
bill
when
she
had
gone
the
detective
read
the
note
again
then
looked
at
it
and
its
envelope
more
closely
they
had
a
strangely
familiar
look
suddenly
he
jerked
open
a
drawer
of
his
desk
on
which
his
new
noiseless
typewriter
stood
selected
a
sheet
of
plain
white
bond
and
rolled
it
into
the
machine
quickly
he
tapped
out
a
copy
of
the
strange
taunting
message
yes
the
margin
was
identical
the
typing
and
its
degree
of
blackness
were
identical
and
the
paper
on
which
he
had
made
the
copy
was
exactly
the
same
as
that
on
which
the
original
had
been
written
the
truth
flashed
into
his
mind
it
was
no
coincidence
that
he
had
a
copy
of
the
very
book
to
which
his
unknown
correspondent
referred
him
for
the
note
had
been
written
in
this
very
room
on
stationery
conveniently
at
hand
on
the
noiseless
typewriter
which
had
been
far
more
considerate
about
not
betraying
the
intruder
than
had
the
parrot
whose
slumbers
had
been
disturbed
but
why
did
my
unknown
friend
risk
arrest
as
a
burglar
if
he
wanted
to
give
me
an
honest
tip
dundee
remarked
aloud
to
the
parrot
who
croaked
an
irrelevant
answer
bad
penny
bad
penny
i
afraid
dear
watson
that
those
words
will
not
be
so
helpful
in
this
case
as
they
were
when
your
mistress
was
murdered
dundee
assured
his
parrot
absently
for
he
was
studying
the
peculiar
situation
from
every
angle
another
question
why
did
the
unknown
bother
to
take
my
who
out
of
the
bookcase
where
i
should
normally
have
looked
for
it
and
put
it
on
that
particular
shelf
warily
for
his
scalp
was
prickling
with
a
premonition
of
danger
dundee
crossed
the
room
to
the
shelf
but
his
hand
did
not
reach
out
for
the
red
book
which
might
have
been
expected
to
solve
one
problem
at
least
the
shelf
he
asked
himself
again
why
not
the
desk
top
or
the
mantelpiece
or
the
smoking
table
beside
the
big
armchair
the
shelf
with
its
drapery
of
rather
fine
old
silk
tapestry
offered
no
answer
in
itself
for
it
held
nothing
except
the
red
book
a
chinese
bowl
and
a
humidor
of
tobacco
and
beneath
the
shelf
was
nothing
but
the
register
the
opening
covered
with
a
metal
screen
which
was
a
mass
of
big
holes
to
permit
the
escape
of
hot
air
when
the
furnace
was
going
in
the
winter
suddenly
dundee
stooped
and
stared
with
eyes
that
were
widened
with
excitement
and
a
certain
amount
of
horror
then
he
rose
and
standing
far
to
one
side
picked
up
the
fat
volume
which
lay
on
the
shelf
as
he
had
expected
a
bullet
whizzed
noiselessly
across
the
room
and
buried
itself
in
the
plaster
of
the
wall
opposite
a
bullet
which
would
have
ploughed
through
his
own
heart
if
he
had
obeyed
his
first
impulse
and
gone
directly
to
the
shelf
to
obey
the
instructions
in
the
note
but
more
had
happened
than
the
whizzing
flight
of
a
bullet
through
one
of
the
holes
of
the
register
the
who
who
had
been
jerked
almost
out
of
dundee
hand
before
he
had
lifted
the
heavy
volume
many
inches
from
the
shelf
coincidental
with
the
disappearance
of
a
bit
of
white
string
which
had
been
pinned
to
a
thin
page
of
the
book
was
a
metallic
clatter
followed
swiftly
by
the
faint
sound
of
a
bump
far
below
dropping
who
who
to
the
floor
dundee
flung
open
his
living
room
door
and
raced
down
three
flights
of
stairs
he
brought
up
panting
at
the
door
of
the
basement
it
was
not
locked
and
in
another
minute
he
was
standing
before
the
big
furnace
above
the
fire
box
was
a
big
metal
compartment
the
reservoir
for
the
heated
air
and
set
into
the
reservoir
to
conduct
the
heat
to
the
regions
above
were
three
huge
pipes
with
strength
augmented
by
excitement
dundee
tugged
and
tore
at
one
of
the
pipes
until
he
had
dislodged
it
then
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
heat
reservoir
he
groped
until
he
had
found
what
he
had
known
must
be
there
marshall
automatic
with
the
maxim
silencer
screwed
upon
the
end
of
its
short
at
last
he
held
in
his
hands
the
weapon
with
which
nita
leigh
selim
and
dexter
sprague
had
been
murdered
the
ingeniousness
of
his
own
attempted
murder
moved
him
to
such
profound
admiration
that
he
could
scarcely
feel
resentment
if
in
the
excitement
of
hunting
for
a
promised
clue
he
had
gone
directly
to
the
shelf
standing
in
front
of
the
hole
in
the
register
into
which
the
end
of
the
silencer
had
been
jammed
so
that
it
showed
scarcely
at
all
even
to
eyes
looking
for
it
he
would
now
have
been
dead
and
the
gun
and
silencer
after
hurtling
down
the
big
pipe
behind
the
register
could
have
lain
hidden
for
months
even
years
in
the
heat
reservoir
of
the
furnace
with
the
weapon
carefully
wrapped
in
his
handkerchief
dundee
went
up
the
stairs
almost
as
swiftly
as
he
had
gone
down
them
meeting
no
one
on
the
way
to
his
rooms
on
the
top
floor
my
most
heartfelt
thanks
to
you
he
greeted
his
parrot
if
you
had
not
squawked
last
night
and
so
frightened
the
murderer
that
he
made
the
vital
error
of
covering
your
cage
i
should
never
have
annoyed
you
again
with
my
sherlock
ruminations
on
cases
which
do
not
interest
you
in
the
slightest
the
parrot
cackled
hoarsely
but
dundee
paid
him
scant
attention
he
picked
up
the
now
harmless
who
who
and
turned
to
page
a
corner
of
which
had
disappeared
with
the
string
that
was
still
fastened
to
the
hammer
of
the
colt
very
clever
and
very
simple
the
murderer
of
two
people
and
the
murderer
of
a
third
had
had
only
to
unscrew
the
metal
covering
of
the
register
wedge
the
end
of
the
silencer
into
one
of
the
many
holes
replace
the
screws
and
paste
the
end
of
the
string
drawn
through
another
hole
hidden
by
the
tapestry
to
a
page
of
the
book
he
had
selected
as
the
one
most
likely
to
appeal
to
a
detective
as
a
clue
source
no
wait
he
had
had
to
do
more
dundee
bent
and
examined
the
metal
cover
of
the
register
the
circumference
of
the
hole
the
murderer
had
chosen
as
the
one
which
would
be
directly
in
front
of
dundee
heart
gleamed
brightly
it
had
been
necessary
to
enlarge
it
considerably
murderer
had
left
a
trace
after
all
but
the
book
was
open
in
dundee
hands
and
his
eyes
rapidly
scanned
page
and
he
found
what
the
murderer
had
not
expected
him
to
live
to
read
but
which
he
had
counted
on
as
an
explanation
of
the
note
which
the
police
would
have
puzzled
over
if
all
had
gone
well
with
his
scheme
chapter
dundee
laughed
the
parrot
which
had
saved
his
life
echoing
his
mirth
raucously
as
his
eyes
hit
upon
the
following
lines
of
fine
print
halfway
down
the
third
column
of
page
of
who
who
in
america
burns
william
john
detective
baltimore
a
taunt
and
a
joke
which
turned
sour
dear
watson
he
exulted
to
the
parrot
a
joke
i
was
not
intended
to
live
to
laugh
over
he
closed
the
book
and
replaced
it
in
the
bookcase
careless
of
fingerprints
for
he
was
sure
the
murderer
had
been
too
clever
to
leave
any
behind
him
in
that
room
or
upon
the
gun
and
silencer
either
for
that
matter
interestedly
dundee
surveyed
the
scene
of
his
attempted
murder
if
he
had
unsuspectingly
gone
up
to
the
high
shelf
to
reach
for
the
book
he
would
have
stood
so
close
to
the
register
that
there
would
have
been
powder
burns
on
his
shirt
front
just
as
there
had
been
on
dexter
sprague
and
he
would
have
been
shot
so
near
an
open
window
no
chance
for
fingerprints
there
either
since
he
had
not
closed
the
windows
on
his
departure
for
new
york
not
wishing
to
return
to
a
stuffy
apartment
that
the
police
would
have
been
justified
in
thinking
he
had
been
shot
from
outside
it
was
an
house
in
more
ways
than
in
the
manner
of
its
heating
outside
of
one
of
his
two
unscreened
windows
there
was
an
iron
grating
the
topmost
landing
of
a
fire
escape
dundee
could
imagine
captain
strawn
positiveness
in
placing
the
murderer
there
crouching
in
wait
for
his
victim
yes
damned
ingenious
this
attempted
murder
undoubtedly
strawn
would
have
dismissed
the
note
as
the
work
of
a
crank
not
hitting
upon
the
fact
that
it
had
been
written
in
that
very
room
on
dundee
own
typewriter
and
stationery
strawn
might
even
have
got
a
mournful
sort
of
amusement
out
of
the
fact
that
dundee
had
been
advised
to
call
upon
a
greater
detective
than
himself
for
assistance
yes
ingenious
indeed
and
so
amazingly
simple
suddenly
the
young
detective
snatched
for
his
hat
if
the
murderer
was
so
ingenious
in
this
case
might
he
not
have
been
equally
clever
in
planning
and
executing
the
murder
of
nita
leigh
selim
twenty
minutes
later
he
parked
his
car
in
the
rutty
road
before
the
selim
house
in
primrose
meadows
and
honked
his
horn
loudly
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
plainclothesmen
captain
strawn
had
detailed
immediately
after
the
murder
to
guard
the
premises
during
the
day
there
was
no
answer
and
a
violent
ringing
of
the
doorbell
also
brought
no
response
the
guard
had
been
withdrawn
probably
to
join
the
small
army
of
plainclothesmen
and
patrolmen
who
had
been
foolishly
and
futilely
searching
for
the
new
york
gunman
the
keystone
of
captain
exploded
theory
with
an
oath
dundee
used
his
skeleton
key
to
release
the
yale
lock
with
which
the
front
door
was
equipped
straight
down
the
main
hall
he
went
and
into
the
little
foyer
between
the
hall
and
nita
bedroom
he
snatched
up
the
telephone
and
to
his
relief
it
was
not
dead
he
gave
the
number
of
captain
strawn
home
and
had
the
pleasure
of
learning
that
he
had
interrupted
his
former
chief
at
a
late
sunday
breakfast
when
did
you
withdraw
the
guard
from
the
selim
house
he
asked
abruptly
cutting
short
strawn
cordial
late
thursday
afternoon
the
chief
of
the
homicide
squad
answered
belligerently
i
needed
all
my
men
and
the
selim
house
had
been
gone
over
with
a
fine
tooth
comb
half
a
dozen
times
why
oh
nothing
dundee
retorted
wearily
and
hung
up
the
receiver
after
assuring
his
old
friend
that
he
would
call
on
him
later
in
the
day
no
use
to
explain
now
to
strawn
that
the
murderer
had
been
given
every
chance
to
remove
any
betraying
traces
of
his
crime
besides
his
first
excited
hunch
after
his
own
attempted
murder
might
very
well
be
a
wild
groundless
one
in
his
dundee
case
the
impossibility
of
the
murder
being
delayed
or
arranged
so
that
the
detective
might
be
slain
when
the
whole
crowd
was
assembled
was
obvious
the
murderer
had
read
in
a
late
saturday
afternoon
extra
a
copy
of
which
was
now
in
pocket
district
attorney
sanderson
boast
to
the
press
that
his
office
had
been
working
on
an
entirely
different
theory
than
that
which
connected
the
two
murders
with
sammy
that
special
investigator
dundee
back
in
hamilton
early
sunday
had
been
investigating
nita
leigh
past
life
in
new
york
and
despite
dundee
telegraphed
warning
he
had
hinted
sensational
revelations
connected
with
the
royal
blue
velvet
dress
which
nita
had
chosen
to
be
her
shroud
and
in
his
desire
to
reassure
the
public
through
the
press
sanderson
had
mysteriously
promised
even
more
specific
revelations
than
dundee
had
actually
brought
home
with
him
prodded
by
reporters
sanderson
had
admitted
that
he
did
not
himself
know
the
nature
of
those
revelations
the
exasperated
young
detective
could
picture
the
murderer
reading
those
sensational
hints
and
promises
could
imagine
his
panic
the
need
for
immediate
action
so
that
special
investigator
dundee
should
not
live
to
tell
the
tale
of
his
new
york
discoveries
to
the
district
attorney
or
anyone
else
but
whether
he
was
right
or
wrong
dundee
determined
to
give
his
hunch
a
chance
he
went
into
the
bedroom
in
which
nita
leigh
selim
had
been
murdered
shot
through
the
back
as
she
sat
at
her
powdering
her
face
if
her
murder
had
been
accomplished
by
mechanical
means
how
had
it
been
done
there
was
no
register
here
from
the
dundee
walked
to
the
window
upon
whose
frame
there
was
still
the
tiny
pencil
mark
which
price
had
drawn
to
indicate
the
end
of
the
path
along
which
the
bullet
had
traveled
provided
it
had
traveled
so
far
nothing
to
aid
in
a
mechanical
murder
but
in
a
flash
dundee
changed
his
mind
for
just
slightly
above
the
pencil
mark
there
was
a
small
dent
in
the
soft
painted
pine
of
the
window
frame
and
before
his
mind
could
frame
words
and
sentences
he
thought
he
saw
how
nita
leigh
had
been
murdered
nothing
here
now
because
he
himself
had
taken
the
lamp
to
the
courthouse
for
he
saw
it
clearly
in
imagination
that
bronze
which
lydia
carr
had
given
to
nita
leigh
its
big
round
bowl
studded
with
great
jewels
of
colored
glass
and
in
recalling
every
detail
of
the
lamp
he
saw
what
he
had
dismissed
as
of
no
importance
at
the
time
in
the
excitement
of
finding
that
the
lamp
bulb
had
been
shattered
by
the
bang
or
bump
which
flora
miles
had
described
of
the
big
glass
jewels
had
been
missing
leaving
an
unsightly
no
wonder
there
had
been
a
bang
or
bump
hard
enough
to
dent
the
frame
of
the
window
for
if
his
hunch
was
correct
the
gun
wedged
into
the
big
bowl
with
the
silencer
slightly
protruding
from
the
had
kicked
just
as
it
had
kicked
an
hour
before
when
it
had
dislodged
itself
from
the
hole
in
the
register
and
clattered
down
the
big
pipe
to
the
heat
reservoir
of
the
furnace
that
the
big
lamp
when
he
following
strawn
had
first
examined
the
scene
of
nita
murder
had
not
stood
in
front
of
the
window
frame
did
not
dampen
dundee
excitement
in
the
least
after
karen
scream
that
room
had
been
filled
with
excited
people
who
had
rushed
about
looking
out
of
the
window
for
the
murderer
and
doing
all
the
other
things
which
people
do
in
such
a
crisis
no
the
murderer
or
murderess
had
found
no
difficulty
in
shifting
the
big
lamp
one
foot
nearer
the
chaise
longue
to
the
place
it
had
always
occupied
before
but
had
the
gun
been
fired
from
the
lamp
electrically
another
picture
flashed
into
dundee
mind
he
saw
himself
stooping
on
monday
afternoon
to
see
if
the
plug
of
the
lamp
cord
had
been
pulled
from
the
socket
saw
it
again
as
it
was
then
nearly
out
so
that
no
current
could
pass
from
the
baseboard
outlet
under
the
bookcase
into
the
bronze
lamp
how
far
from
the
truth
his
conclusion
that
monday
had
been
but
what
was
the
truth
suddenly
dundee
flung
back
the
wilton
rug
which
almost
entirely
covered
the
bedroom
floor
and
revealed
the
bell
which
dexter
sprague
had
rigged
up
so
that
nita
might
summon
lydia
from
her
basement
room
in
case
of
dire
need
a
precaution
with
which
the
murderer
was
probably
familiar
since
lois
dunlap
might
innocently
have
spread
the
news
of
its
existence
there
was
a
hole
in
the
hardwood
floor
and
out
of
it
issued
a
length
of
green
electric
cord
connected
with
two
small
flat
metal
plates
one
upon
the
other
so
that
when
stepped
upon
a
bell
would
ring
in
lydia
basement
room
but
there
was
something
odd
about
the
wire
although
it
was
obviously
new
a
section
of
it
near
the
two
metal
plates
was
wrapped
with
black
adhesive
tape
another
memory
knocked
for
attention
upon
dundee
mind
long
cord
of
the
bronze
lamp
had
been
mended
with
exactly
the
same
sort
of
tape
about
a
foot
from
where
it
ended
in
the
contact
within
another
two
minutes
dundee
with
a
flashlight
he
had
found
in
the
kitchen
was
exploring
the
dark
earthy
portion
of
the
basement
which
lay
directly
to
the
east
of
lydia
carr
basement
room
and
he
found
what
he
was
looking
for
adhesive
tape
wrapped
about
the
wire
which
had
been
dropped
through
the
floor
of
nita
room
before
it
had
been
carried
by
means
of
another
hole
into
lydia
room
he
was
too
late
thanks
to
captain
strawn
the
bell
which
sprague
had
rigged
up
was
in
working
order
again
but
as
he
was
passing
out
of
the
basement
he
glanced
at
the
ceiling
of
the
large
room
devoted
to
furnace
heater
and
laundry
tubs
and
in
the
ceiling
he
saw
a
hole
the
murderer
had
left
a
trace
he
could
not
obliterate
at
three
that
sunday
afternoon
bonnie
dundee
fatigued
after
a
strenuous
day
and
suffering
to
his
own
somewhat
disgusted
amusement
from
reaction
even
a
detective
feels
some
shock
at
having
narrowly
escaped
death
permitted
himself
the
luxury
of
a
call
upon
penny
crain
he
found
the
girl
and
her
mother
playing
anagrams
after
greeting
him
crain
rose
to
surrender
her
place
to
the
visitor
play
with
this
girl
of
mine
dundee
she
too
clever
for
me
she
beaten
me
every
game
so
far
and
when
i
plead
for
bridge
as
a
chance
to
get
even
she
shudders
at
the
very
word
why
did
you
drag
poor
ralph
away
from
his
dinner
here
today
penny
demanded
scrambling
the
little
wooden
blocks
until
they
made
a
weird
pattern
of
letters
because
i
wanted
to
find
out
exactly
nita
selim
was
killed
and
i
did
dundee
answered
i
wish
i
knew
as
well
murdered
her
mute
before
penny
excited
questions
the
detective
idly
selected
letters
from
the
mass
of
blocks
on
the
table
and
spelled
out
in
a
long
row
the
names
of
all
the
guests
at
nita
fatal
bridge
party
suddenly
and
with
a
cry
that
startled
penny
dundee
made
a
new
name
with
the
little
wooden
letters
now
he
knew
the
answers
to
both
and
chapter
i
fail
to
see
any
necessity
for
all
this
secrecy
and
district
attorney
sanderson
protested
irritably
why
the
devil
you
come
clean
and
give
us
the
if
you
have
it
on
this
miserable
business
instead
of
summoning
captain
strawn
to
my
office
so
that
you
can
give
orders
to
us
both
before
dundee
could
answer
captain
strawn
came
to
his
assistance
i
worked
with
this
boy
for
pretty
near
a
year
bill
and
never
yet
did
he
fail
to
make
good
when
he
said
he
had
a
pot
on
to
boil
if
he
says
it
will
boil
over
this
evening
provided
we
help
him
boil
over
it
will
or
i
do
know
bonnie
dundee
sanderson
scowled
but
capitulated
all
right
what
do
you
want
thanks
chief
and
thanks
captain
dundee
cried
with
heartfelt
gratitude
first
i
want
to
be
excused
from
attending
the
adjourned
inquests
into
the
two
murders
scheduled
for
three
today
sanderson
agreed
shortly
second
after
about
an
hour
of
routine
stuff
i
wish
you
ask
for
another
adjournment
until
tomorrow
on
the
plea
that
important
developments
are
expected
today
again
third
i
like
you
personally
to
request
the
appearance
of
every
person
connected
in
any
way
with
each
of
the
murders
in
your
office
this
afternoon
at
four
so
the
whole
bunch
will
be
kept
together
and
have
no
chance
to
go
to
their
homes
or
anywhere
else
until
i
am
ready
for
them
you
can
say
that
owing
to
the
illness
of
your
mother
during
the
investigations
you
want
to
question
everyone
personally
do
you
want
all
the
servants
brought
here
too
sanderson
asked
none
but
lydia
carr
dundee
answered
after
about
an
hour
innocuous
questioning
please
invite
them
to
accompany
you
to
the
selim
house
for
that
and
he
grinned
is
where
the
pot
is
scheduled
to
boil
over
i
like
everybody
to
be
there
by
where
do
i
come
in
captain
strawn
demanded
almost
jealously
now
that
you
are
no
longer
looking
for
a
new
york
gunman
i
suppose
you
have
plenty
of
plainclothesmen
at
your
disposal
dundee
asked
and
was
instantly
sorry
he
had
reminded
his
former
chief
of
the
collapse
of
his
cherished
and
satisfying
theory
plenty
strawn
answered
gruffly
how
many
will
you
need
enough
to
keep
every
person
on
sanderson
invitation
list
under
strictest
observation
until
the
pot
boils
over
dundee
replied
when
do
you
want
them
to
get
on
the
job
as
soon
as
they
can
do
so
after
you
get
back
to
your
office
are
they
to
follow
the
whole
gang
clear
out
to
the
selim
house
most
decidedly
after
the
unwilling
guests
are
safely
within
the
house
your
boys
must
guard
the
premises
so
that
leaves
without
permission
that
all
as
good
as
done
strawn
assured
him
now
about
them
inquiries
you
asked
me
to
make
yesterday
of
the
secretary
of
the
american
legion
he
drew
a
scrap
of
paper
from
his
breast
pocket
i
find
that
john
drake
peter
dunlap
and
clive
hammond
were
all
in
service
in
the
th
division
which
was
held
up
late
in
january
for
nearly
two
weeks
in
hoboken
before
the
war
department
could
get
transports
to
send
to
france
miles
who
enlisted
the
day
war
was
declared
was
wounded
and
shipped
home
late
in
he
was
discharged
as
unfit
for
further
service
spinal
operation
from
a
new
jersey
base
hospital
on
january
furthermore
judge
marshall
was
in
new
york
the
whole
winter
of
attached
to
the
red
cross
in
some
legal
capacity
he
donated
his
services
and
all
that
does
matter
now
captain
but
thanks
just
the
same
dundee
interrupted
now
if
you
will
both
excuse
me
i
got
a
lot
of
work
to
do
before
five
today
dundee
had
not
exaggerated
that
monday
was
one
of
the
busiest
days
he
had
ever
spent
in
all
the
years
of
his
life
he
began
rather
strangely
by
visiting
half
a
dozen
of
hamilton
hardware
stores
exhibiting
a
peculiar
instrument
and
making
annoying
inquiries
as
to
when
and
to
whom
it
had
been
sold
but
at
his
sixth
port
of
call
success
so
completely
rewarded
his
efforts
that
he
was
jubilant
when
he
bade
the
mystified
proprietor
good
day
a
signed
statement
reposing
in
his
wallet
two
other
calls
both
in
office
buildings
took
up
only
an
hour
of
his
time
and
a
taxicab
delivered
him
at
police
headquarters
just
as
the
factory
whistles
were
sirening
the
news
that
it
was
twelve
he
was
lucky
enough
to
find
the
fingerprint
expert
carraway
in
his
cubbyhole
of
an
office
his
desk
almost
crowded
out
by
immense
filing
cabinets
five
minutes
later
dundee
sat
at
that
desk
photographs
of
dexter
sprague
dead
body
just
as
it
had
been
discovered
on
the
floor
of
the
trophy
room
in
the
miles
home
and
a
labelled
set
of
fingerprints
spread
out
before
him
you
sure
there
can
have
been
no
mistake
he
asked
no
chance
that
these
fingerprint
photographs
were
when
the
prints
were
made
not
a
chance
with
my
system
carraway
retorted
positively
fine
dundee
cried
may
i
take
these
photographs
you
have
copies
i
presume
it
was
half
past
two
when
dundee
after
a
much
needed
lunch
parked
his
car
in
the
driveway
of
one
of
the
most
splendid
houses
overlooking
mirror
lake
a
home
whose
master
and
mistress
were
now
attending
an
inquest
into
two
murders
half
an
hour
later
he
climbed
into
his
roadster
again
his
head
spinning
did
i
say
he
marvelled
he
drove
directly
to
the
selim
house
for
he
had
much
to
do
before
the
arrival
of
sanderson
compulsory
guests
at
his
first
visit
there
was
to
a
small
room
in
the
basement
a
dark
cubbyhole
next
to
the
coal
room
he
had
locked
it
carefully
after
exploring
it
the
day
before
for
he
had
taken
no
chance
on
leaving
unguarded
as
he
had
found
it
treasure
worth
more
to
him
than
its
weight
in
gold
and
queer
treasure
it
was
that
he
extracted
now
a
coiled
length
of
electric
wire
which
he
and
ralph
hammond
had
measured
the
day
before
with
triumphant
excitement
a
box
of
thumb
tacks
many
of
them
surprisingly
bent
at
the
point
an
augur
with
a
set
of
bits
of
varying
sizes
a
and
a
hammer
if
dexter
sprague
had
not
overestimated
the
amount
of
electric
wire
needed
for
the
job
of
installing
an
alarm
bell
between
nita
bedroom
and
lydia
dundee
was
about
to
close
the
tool
chest
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
piece
of
hardware
he
had
not
expected
ever
to
find
although
he
had
known
of
its
existence
for
more
than
an
hour
at
he
was
entirely
ready
for
sanderson
captain
strawn
and
their
party
of
indignant
and
unwilling
guests
oh
mr
dundee
carolyn
drake
squealed
you
not
going
to
make
us
play
that
awful
hand
again
are
you
they
were
all
crowding
about
him
the
men
and
women
who
had
been
nita
selim
guests
at
her
last
bridge
and
cocktail
party
not
only
are
the
bridge
tables
exactly
where
they
were
at
this
time
on
the
evening
of
may
dundee
answered
significantly
that
all
stopped
chattering
to
listen
everything
else
in
the
house
is
precisely
as
it
was
fortunately
not
even
the
has
been
cut
off
but
to
make
sure
i
have
forgotten
nothing
i
wish
you
would
all
follow
me
into
selim
bedroom
and
look
for
yourselves
like
sheep
they
crowded
into
the
little
foyer
and
on
into
the
bedroom
there
stood
the
big
bronze
lamp
set
squarely
in
front
of
the
window
frame
and
in
a
direct
line
with
the
musical
powder
box
on
dead
dressing
table
at
penny
crain
karen
marshall
carolyn
drake
and
flora
miles
who
had
been
requisitioned
by
dundee
to
play
the
part
of
the
murdered
woman
were
seated
at
table
no
and
behind
karen
chair
stood
lois
dunlap
clive
hammond
and
his
new
wife
were
again
together
in
the
solarium
but
there
dundee
restaging
of
the
original
scene
in
the
tragic
drama
ended
everyone
else
including
lydia
carr
and
peter
dunlap
were
huddled
together
in
a
far
corner
of
the
living
room
now
mr
miles
dundee
called
your
cue
never
mind
the
comedy
about
tricks
simply
go
into
the
dining
room
with
dunlap
to
mix
cocktails
you
find
all
the
ingredients
still
on
the
sideboard
exactly
as
there
were
when
selim
sent
you
to
mix
drinks
on
may
and
mrs
miles
will
you
pretending
that
you
are
nita
selim
go
to
powder
your
face
at
selim
her
face
white
and
drawn
flora
miles
stumbled
from
the
room
just
as
her
husband
dumb
for
once
with
rage
entered
the
dining
room
with
lois
dunlap
dundee
was
about
to
follow
the
latter
two
when
an
interruption
occurred
followed
by
a
plainclothesman
a
man
entered
the
living
room
tall
determined
he
strode
to
the
bridge
table
his
handsome
head
upflung
his
brown
eyes
fixed
upon
the
widened
brown
eyes
of
penny
crain
dad
the
girl
breathed
then
joyously
oh
dad
you
come
home
but
dundee
halted
the
reconciliation
with
a
stern
word
of
command
please
join
the
group
in
the
corner
mr
crain
regardless
of
the
ensuing
hubbub
dundee
strode
into
the
dining
room
where
tracey
miles
stood
at
the
sideboard
pouring
whiskey
from
an
almost
empty
decanter
into
a
small
glass
may
i
drink
the
scotch
tracey
has
poured
for
me
mr
dundee
dunlap
asked
shakily
leaning
against
the
big
round
table
yes
but
silence
please
he
cried
as
there
came
the
first
faint
tinkling
notes
of
from
nita
musical
powder
box
penetrating
the
thin
wall
between
the
bedroom
and
dining
room
as
i
have
said
the
detective
spoke
loudly
and
clearly
above
the
tinkle
of
music
is
now
exactly
as
it
was
when
nita
selim
was
permit
me
to
show
you
all
how
that
murder
was
accomplished
a
chair
at
the
bridge
table
was
overturned
lois
dunlap
almost
choked
on
her
drink
of
scotch
women
screamed
in
a
few
seconds
every
person
in
the
living
room
including
the
district
attorney
and
strawn
was
huddled
in
the
wide
opening
into
the
dining
room
their
eyes
fixed
in
horror
upon
bonnie
dundee
he
spoke
again
his
voice
very
clear
but
slow
and
weighted
with
a
dreadful
significance
dunlap
step
on
the
bell
beneath
the
dining
table
lois
dunlap
dropped
the
empty
whiskey
glass
her
face
suddenly
wiped
of
all
expression
step
on
that
bell
dunlap
as
you
did
as
if
hypnotized
lois
dunlap
began
to
grope
with
the
toe
of
her
right
pump
for
the
slight
bulge
under
the
rug
which
indicated
the
position
of
the
bell
used
for
summoning
the
maid
from
the
kitchen
with
a
strangled
cry
tracey
miles
lunged
across
the
few
feet
which
separated
the
woman
and
himself
seized
her
arm
and
whirled
her
violently
away
from
the
table
you
want
to
kill
my
wife
too
he
panted
his
usually
florid
face
the
color
of
putty
you
chapter
that
would
be
impossible
miles
dundee
said
deliberately
your
wife
is
already
dead
then
his
clear
words
rang
out
like
the
knell
of
doom
tracey
arthur
miles
i
arrest
you
for
the
murder
of
your
wife
known
as
juanita
leigh
selim
and
for
the
murder
of
dexter
sprague
and
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
anything
you
say
may
be
used
against
you
tracey
miles
lifted
his
ashen
face
and
stared
at
the
detective
blankly
as
though
he
had
gone
deaf
and
blind
all
over
is
it
may
i
have
a
drink
he
managed
to
articulate
at
last
poor
devil
he
needs
it
the
young
detective
told
himself
as
miles
poured
a
drink
from
the
almost
empty
whiskey
decanter
and
raised
the
little
glass
to
his
lips
i
have
nothing
to
say
the
murderer
gasped
thickly
then
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
it
was
of
an
hour
later
district
attorney
sanderson
captain
strawn
and
dundee
were
alone
in
the
house
where
nita
selim
had
been
murdered
and
where
her
husband
had
confessed
his
crimes
by
committing
suicide
the
morgue
ambulance
had
come
and
gone
i
should
have
known
dundee
admitted
ruefully
as
the
three
men
entered
nita
bedroom
that
so
ingenious
a
criminal
as
tracey
miles
would
not
have
failed
to
provide
against
the
possibility
of
discovery
he
must
have
seized
an
opportunity
to
spill
cyanide
of
potassium
into
the
decanter
when
my
eyes
were
off
him
for
a
moment
and
upon
lois
dunlap
i
glad
he
did
sanderson
said
curtly
but
it
was
ghastly
that
poor
lois
had
to
know
that
it
was
she
in
all
innocence
who
fired
the
shot
that
killed
her
friend
it
was
dundee
sighed
but
i
believed
that
the
only
way
i
could
make
miles
confess
was
to
frighten
him
into
thinking
flora
would
be
killed
in
the
same
manner
well
it
worked
captain
strawn
and
i
are
still
in
the
dark
as
to
exactly
how
miles
managed
his
wife
murder
sanderson
reminded
him
this
morning
you
chose
to
tell
us
nothing
more
than
that
a
hamilton
man
had
married
nita
leigh
in
new
york
in
january
and
that
eight
years
ago
when
he
saw
her
picture
in
hamilton
evening
along
with
the
story
that
lee
had
committed
suicide
he
felt
free
to
marry
again
you
said
then
you
knew
who
the
man
was
but
you
would
not
even
tell
us
how
you
knew
because
i
had
very
little
actual
proof
then
dundee
answered
as
to
who
he
was
the
salient
clue
had
been
staring
me
in
the
face
the
whole
time
but
it
was
not
until
i
was
fooling
with
a
set
of
anagrams
last
night
idly
spelling
out
the
names
of
all
the
men
who
have
married
her
and
then
murdered
her
that
i
saw
it
saw
strawn
demanded
irritably
that
selim
is
simply
miles
spelled
backwards
dundee
explained
possibly
because
he
considered
it
the
sophisticated
thing
to
do
miles
used
an
assumed
name
at
the
party
at
which
he
met
nita
leigh
and
married
her
under
that
name
shortly
afterward
even
the
first
name
by
which
she
knew
him
was
only
his
initials
reversed
simple
but
clever
sanderson
commented
just
as
were
all
of
miles
schemes
after
nita
egged
on
by
sprague
turned
up
in
hamilton
to
demand
alimony
as
the
price
of
her
silence
but
let
me
show
you
how
he
killed
his
wife
he
strode
to
the
big
bronze
lamp
it
took
me
less
than
an
hour
today
to
reconstruct
the
death
machine
so
that
it
would
be
almost
exactly
as
it
was
when
miles
finished
his
work
just
before
on
saturday
may
and
as
it
remained
until
he
had
an
opportunity
to
come
back
here
and
dismantle
it
trust
him
to
find
out
that
the
guard
was
removed
from
the
house
thursday
as
he
spoke
he
was
unscrewing
the
big
bowl
of
the
bronze
lamp
wedged
at
a
angle
inside
the
bowl
which
was
twelve
inches
in
diameter
was
judge
marshall
automatic
the
attached
maxim
silencer
projecting
slightly
from
the
hole
whose
jewel
was
missing
lydia
told
me
last
night
over
the
telephone
and
very
much
surprised
she
was
too
when
i
swore
her
to
secrecy
that
the
jewel
had
been
lost
when
the
lamp
was
shipped
from
new
york
dundee
explained
there
a
blank
cartridge
in
the
gun
now
of
course
but
miles
in
his
panic
took
my
words
literally
see
the
strapped
to
the
gun
butt
he
got
it
from
the
bell
sprague
had
installed
in
lydia
bedroom
and
he
returned
it
when
he
was
up
so
that
the
bell
would
ring
again
the
magnet
he
connected
with
the
electric
wire
in
one
of
the
two
lamp
sockets
as
you
see
it
now
and
the
long
cord
of
the
lamp
was
connected
with
the
wire
of
the
bell
in
the
dining
room
so
connected
that
when
anyone
stepped
on
the
two
little
metal
plates
under
the
dining
room
rug
the
kitchen
bell
would
ring
and
the
gun
would
be
fired
simultaneously
but
if
you
will
examine
the
jewel
hole
he
suggested
you
will
see
that
miles
had
to
enlarge
it
considerably
using
a
reamer
which
i
found
in
the
tool
chest
in
the
basement
along
with
all
the
apparatus
sprague
had
bought
for
installing
nita
alarm
bell
i
could
see
no
reason
for
sprague
having
needed
a
reamer
for
his
little
job
however
and
this
morning
i
was
lucky
enough
to
get
proof
that
miles
himself
had
purchased
it
at
a
hardware
store
on
the
tuesday
before
nita
murder
how
did
he
connect
the
lamp
cord
with
the
dining
room
bell
strawn
puzzled
these
modern
houses
do
have
exposed
wiring
you
forget
sprague
wiring
for
the
alarm
bell
from
here
to
room
and
dundee
threw
back
the
rug
showing
them
the
hole
in
the
floor
out
of
which
came
a
short
length
of
electric
wire
ending
in
two
small
metal
plates
but
attached
now
to
the
wire
was
the
cord
from
the
bronze
lamp
the
plug
of
the
lamp
cord
is
nearly
out
of
the
baseboard
outlet
behind
the
bookcase
just
as
miles
left
it
so
that
there
is
no
contact
with
electricity
there
and
the
rug
which
almost
entirely
covers
the
floor
hides
as
you
have
seen
the
joining
of
the
two
wires
an
inexplicable
wrapping
of
adhesive
tape
both
on
the
lamp
cord
and
on
the
wire
of
nita
alarm
bell
here
gave
me
the
clue
in
installing
the
alarm
bell
sprague
copied
the
arrangement
under
the
dining
table
of
course
and
miles
simply
had
to
drop
a
bit
fastened
to
the
augur
sprague
had
bought
and
used
for
his
own
job
down
the
four
inches
which
separate
the
dining
room
floor
from
the
basement
ceiling
boring
a
hole
through
the
ceiling
it
was
that
hole
in
the
ceiling
that
i
could
not
understand
and
which
ralph
hammond
assured
me
was
not
there
saturday
morning
before
nita
was
killed
miles
joined
a
piece
of
electric
wire
to
the
dining
room
bell
wires
and
pushed
it
down
through
the
hole
he
had
bored
into
the
basement
ceiling
now
if
you
come
down
with
me
when
the
three
men
stood
staring
upward
at
the
basement
ceiling
dundee
continued
see
this
long
wire
running
along
the
ceiling
from
the
hole
beneath
the
dining
room
bell
the
tacks
miles
used
to
secure
it
were
also
returned
to
the
tool
chest
but
he
could
not
get
rid
of
either
the
augur
hole
or
the
tiny
holes
showing
the
course
of
the
wire
let
follow
it
he
led
them
across
the
basement
to
a
door
leading
into
a
dank
unfinished
portion
of
the
cellar
directly
east
of
lydia
bedroom
and
beneath
nita
the
wire
whose
course
they
were
following
led
under
the
top
frame
of
the
door
and
with
a
flashlight
in
his
hand
dundee
showed
how
it
continued
along
a
rafter
until
it
reached
the
place
where
it
was
joined
by
adhesive
tape
to
the
wire
sprague
had
dropped
from
bedroom
floor
above
miles
simply
cut
the
wire
here
where
it
enters
another
hole
through
lydia
bedroom
wall
and
attached
the
new
wire
dundee
explained
the
connection
between
the
dining
room
bell
and
the
in
the
lamp
upstairs
was
then
complete
sprague
had
bought
yards
too
much
of
the
wire
fortunately
for
miles
scheme
but
what
a
chance
miles
took
on
the
bullet
not
hitting
her
in
a
fatal
spot
sanderson
commented
in
an
awed
voice
not
much
of
a
chance
dundee
denied
he
would
fire
the
gun
only
when
he
knew
nita
was
seated
before
her
experienced
marksman
that
he
was
he
could
calculate
the
path
of
the
bullet
to
a
nicety
of
course
the
machine
had
to
be
used
that
very
day
as
you
know
nita
herself
gave
him
his
chance
miles
standing
at
the
sideboard
which
was
separated
from
nita
dressing
table
only
by
a
thin
wall
listened
until
the
first
faint
notes
of
told
him
that
nita
was
powdering
her
face
he
could
be
almost
positive
that
nita
was
sitting
down
to
her
task
the
poor
girl
saw
nothing
to
alarm
her
but
the
gun
kicked
when
the
shot
was
fired
by
lois
innocent
stepping
upon
the
dining
room
bell
and
the
big
lamp
was
rocked
so
that
it
banged
against
the
window
frame
shattering
the
one
bulb
miles
had
left
in
it
of
course
he
moved
the
lamp
a
foot
or
so
in
the
resulting
excitement
and
if
nita
had
been
wounded
only
living
to
tell
how
the
shot
was
fired
miles
would
have
committed
suicide
then
and
there
what
if
nita
had
not
asked
him
to
mix
cocktails
or
had
not
gone
to
powder
her
face
strawn
asked
the
whole
party
was
going
to
dine
and
dance
at
the
country
club
miles
would
have
escorted
her
home
as
he
had
done
on
monday
night
when
nita
had
probably
made
her
last
demand
he
could
have
counted
on
going
into
her
bedroom
to
powder
her
face
even
if
he
had
had
to
tell
her
that
her
nose
was
shiny
and
would
himself
then
have
gone
to
the
dining
room
on
the
excuse
that
he
needed
a
drink
before
discussing
but
i
must
tell
you
that
on
saturday
morning
according
to
the
telephone
operator
in
miles
office
into
whom
i
put
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
the
law
when
i
interviewed
her
this
morning
nita
rang
miles
to
say
she
must
see
him
as
soon
as
possible
her
unexpressed
intention
being
to
tell
him
that
she
was
not
going
to
make
him
come
across
again
miles
the
telephone
operator
confessed
to
having
on
the
whole
conversation
told
her
he
would
be
right
out
but
nita
said
she
and
lydia
were
going
into
hamilton
and
would
not
be
back
until
the
time
the
bridge
game
was
scheduled
to
begin
that
was
the
opportunity
miles
had
been
praying
for
and
he
came
on
out
having
previously
stolen
the
gun
and
silencer
and
having
studied
this
house
how
had
he
got
in
sanderson
wanted
to
know
judge
marshall
had
lent
him
a
key
in
february
when
miles
wanted
to
show
the
house
to
an
engaged
young
man
in
his
offices
and
miles
had
neglected
to
return
it
well
when
he
arrived
he
found
ralph
hammond
here
and
had
to
leave
waiting
at
a
safe
distance
probably
until
the
coast
was
clear
about
one
even
so
he
had
more
than
an
hour
to
do
his
carefully
planned
job
had
to
die
miles
could
not
continue
to
pay
her
large
sums
of
money
since
he
was
really
only
an
employe
of
flora
everything
he
held
dear
in
the
world
was
threatened
he
loved
flora
he
adored
his
children
and
he
could
not
give
up
the
luxury
and
social
position
which
his
bigamous
marriage
with
flora
why
did
he
make
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
mess
to
flora
since
he
had
not
married
her
until
he
believed
nita
leigh
was
dead
sanderson
interrupted
you
must
remember
that
flora
was
carrying
on
a
violent
flirtation
with
sprague
him
to
get
the
lead
in
the
hamilton
movie
if
sprague
got
the
job
of
directing
it
dundee
reminded
him
miles
victim
of
a
sexual
inferiority
complex
must
have
felt
sure
that
flora
on
discovering
she
was
not
legally
married
would
snatch
at
the
chance
to
marry
sprague
which
was
of
course
what
sprague
had
planned
in
case
nita
published
the
truth
but
you
were
wrong
about
the
secret
shelf
the
gun
was
never
there
strawn
gloated
no
but
it
was
the
absence
of
fingerprints
on
the
pivoting
panel
and
shelf
which
kept
me
on
the
right
track
miles
had
searched
the
shelf
for
the
marriage
certificate
which
he
could
not
know
nita
had
already
burned
probably
too
he
had
written
her
a
few
letters
during
their
short
courtship
how
was
sprague
killed
sanderson
interrupted
impatiently
dundee
led
the
way
across
the
basement
to
a
cubbyhole
next
to
the
coal
room
entered
and
came
out
with
a
narrow
deep
drawer
of
ebony
inlaid
with
first
i
must
tell
you
that
miles
got
the
gun
out
of
the
lamp
that
saturday
night
parking
his
car
at
a
distance
and
sneaking
into
the
house
while
i
was
talking
with
lydia
in
the
basement
we
can
guess
that
he
stowed
gun
silencer
and
in
a
pocket
of
his
car
at
any
rate
he
came
back
noisily
enough
a
little
later
to
offer
lydia
a
job
as
nurse
in
his
home
doubtless
he
assured
himself
that
she
knew
nothing
or
poor
lydia
would
have
gone
the
way
of
her
mistress
and
sprague
was
sprague
strawn
began
despite
my
warning
dundee
went
on
refusing
to
be
hurried
sprague
made
a
demand
for
blackmail
money
upon
miles
it
is
possible
that
sprague
also
sneaking
into
the
house
that
saturday
night
to
get
his
bag
saw
miles
retrieve
the
gun
at
any
rate
sprague
knew
that
miles
was
the
only
person
among
all
the
company
who
had
a
real
motive
for
killing
nita
selim
and
he
undoubtedly
blackmailed
miles
as
a
murderer
as
well
as
a
bigamist
perhaps
miles
put
him
off
for
a
day
or
two
but
on
wednesday
judge
marshall
begged
for
a
bridge
game
and
miles
seized
the
opportunity
of
again
having
the
original
crowd
present
a
sort
of
wall
of
integrity
surrounding
and
including
him
for
i
do
think
he
really
wanted
to
involve
his
best
friends
as
suspects
i
believe
he
merely
wanted
to
hide
among
them
apparently
as
above
suspicion
as
they
were
and
there
is
safety
in
numbers
you
know
at
any
rate
miles
made
an
appointment
wednesday
afternoon
with
sprague
telling
him
that
if
he
would
come
to
his
home
that
evening
and
manage
to
leave
the
bridge
game
while
he
was
dummy
he
would
find
the
money
he
was
demanding
a
drawer
of
the
cabinet
that
stood
between
the
two
windows
in
the
trophy
dundee
exhibited
the
drawer
he
had
taken
from
the
basement
tool
room
this
drawer
i
took
it
away
from
the
miles
home
this
afternoon
while
everyone
but
a
chambermaid
was
at
the
inquest
miles
did
not
have
time
to
go
home
before
going
to
your
office
sanderson
with
the
rest
of
the
crowd
you
had
summoned
for
questioning
if
he
had
he
would
have
killed
himself
as
soon
as
he
found
the
incriminating
drawer
was
missing
from
the
cabinet
but
sanderson
began
frowning
with
bewilderment
very
simple
dundee
answered
when
sprague
pulled
open
this
drawer
which
was
set
in
the
cabinet
at
just
the
height
of
his
stomach
he
received
a
bullet
in
his
heart
see
these
four
little
holes
a
vise
was
screwed
into
the
bottom
of
the
drawer
so
that
it
gripped
the
gun
with
its
silencer
at
an
upward
angle
a
piece
of
string
was
tied
to
the
trigger
and
fastened
somehow
to
the
underside
of
the
drawer
so
that
when
sprague
pulled
the
drawer
open
the
string
was
drawn
taut
and
the
trigger
pulled
practically
the
same
mechanism
by
which
he
tried
to
murder
me
the
kick
of
the
gun
jerked
the
drawer
shut
all
miles
had
to
do
when
he
was
pretending
to
look
for
sprague
was
to
turn
off
the
trophy
room
light
by
a
button
one
of
a
series
on
the
outside
wall
of
the
hall
closet
probably
it
had
been
agreed
between
them
that
sprague
would
not
return
to
the
bridge
game
hence
sprague
telephoning
for
a
taxi
to
wait
for
him
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
his
taking
his
hat
and
stick
into
the
trophy
room
with
him
then
miles
had
from
midnight
till
dawn
to
remove
the
gun
yes
some
time
during
the
night
after
flora
was
asleep
with
a
sedative
which
she
badly
needed
because
of
the
quarrel
a
genuine
one
which
she
and
tracey
had
had
over
sprague
miles
slipped
down
to
the
trophy
room
and
removed
the
gun
and
vise
but
he
could
not
remove
the
holes
the
screws
had
made
although
he
did
cover
the
bottom
of
the
usually
empty
drawer
with
old
pamphlets
on
the
care
and
feeding
of
dogs
by
the
way
the
chambermaid
told
me
that
her
master
spent
about
half
an
hour
before
dinner
that
thursday
night
in
the
trophy
room
over
his
fishing
tackle
his
next
concern
was
to
make
the
murder
jibe
completely
with
captain
strawn
theory
of
a
gunman
who
had
trailed
his
quarry
to
the
miles
home
and
shot
him
through
the
window
the
window
was
already
open
but
the
screen
had
to
be
raised
too
and
sprague
fingerprints
had
to
be
on
the
nickel
catches
by
which
the
screen
curtain
is
raised
or
lowered
of
course
sprague
had
not
touched
the
screen
do
you
mean
to
say
he
lugged
the
corpse
to
the
window
and
lifted
it
up
so
that
he
could
press
the
stiff
fingers
upon
the
nickel
catches
sanderson
asked
with
a
shudder
what
a
fiend
no
dundee
assured
him
that
was
unnecessary
he
simply
removed
the
curtain
screen
which
is
so
designed
that
it
can
be
taken
down
and
put
up
as
easily
as
a
window
shade
he
carried
the
screen
his
own
hands
protected
by
gloves
i
suppose
to
where
sprague
right
hand
lay
on
the
floor
and
pressed
the
thumb
and
forefinger
against
the
catches
making
fingerprints
all
right
but
they
were
reversed
as
i
discovered
when
it
occurred
to
me
to
examine
the
photographs
of
sprague
fingerprints
in
carraway
office
today
miles
could
not
turn
the
stiff
hand
over
without
bruising
the
dead
flesh
consequently
the
print
of
the
forefinger
was
on
the
catch
where
the
thumb
would
normally
have
left
its
mark
and
vice
versa
before
i
forget
it
i
should
also
tell
you
that
i
found
a
master
key
hanging
on
the
keyboard
in
the
butler
pantry
big
houses
with
their
many
locks
are
usually
provided
with
a
master
key
and
miles
undoubtedly
used
that
one
to
gain
entrance
into
my
room
after
midnight
saturday
morning
where
did
you
find
the
vise
strawn
asked
in
the
tool
chest
right
here
where
he
had
also
placed
the
reamer
he
had
bought
the
vise
probably
belonged
to
miles
originally
but
he
was
taking
no
chances
on
anything
being
found
in
his
possession
provided
we
tumbled
to
the
two
crimes
were
committed
the
reamer
he
must
have
brought
out
here
after
he
used
it
to
enlarge
the
hole
in
my
register
after
midnight
sunday
morning
it
is
possible
he
did
his
cleaning
up
job
here
at
the
same
time
it
was
safe
enough
to
have
lights
on
since
the
house
is
so
isolated
and
there
had
been
no
guard
here
since
thursday
well
sanderson
drew
a
deep
breath
he
was
a
far
cleverer
man
than
any
of
us
suspected
the
mechanical
arrangements
were
absurdly
easy
to
rig
up
in
all
three
cases
but
the
of
them
it
is
a
pity
nita
did
not
fear
him
as
she
feared
sprague
vengeance
you
right
dundee
answered
nita
did
not
fear
miles
not
even
when
she
was
making
him
pay
and
pay
no
woman
could
look
at
miles
and
believe
him
capable
of
murder
but
a
conviction
of
sexual
inferiority
leads
to
strange
things
as
psychologists
can
tell
you
i
believe
miles
married
the
only
two
women
who
ever
fell
in
love
with
him
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
nita
really
loved
him
for
she
kept
her
wedding
dress
for
more
than
twelve
years
and
chose
it
to
be
her
shroud
it
is
possible
she
was
still
fond
of
him
although
she
was
infatuated
with
sprague
when
she
came
down
here
and
was
later
sincerely
in
love
with
ralph
hammond
another
reason
she
did
not
fear
miles
when
she
made
her
will
was
that
she
counted
on
being
able
to
tell
him
saturday
night
at
the
latest
that
she
would
never
ask
him
for
money
again
if
he
would
trade
silence
for
silence
how
she
hoped
to
secure
sprague
silence
we
can
only
guess
at
probably
she
meant
to
buy
it
with
the
remainder
of
the
she
had
already
got
from
miles
provided
sprague
did
not
kill
her
for
ditching
him
as
a
lover
we
know
she
foresaw
that
possibility
since
she
willed
the
money
to
lydia
of
course
if
sprague
had
proved
tractable
nita
as
ralph
wife
would
have
been
able
to
compensate
lydia
handsomely
for
the
injury
she
had
done
her
poor
nita
and
poor
flora
sanderson
sighed
as
he
led
the
way
up
the
basement
stairs
hello
someone
calling
you
bonnie
dundee
ran
through
the
kitchen
and
dining
room
and
into
the
living
room
for
he
had
recognized
penny
crain
sweet
husky
contralto
what
are
doing
back
here
young
woman
he
demanded
you
were
told
to
go
home
and
forget
all
this
ugly
business
dad
wants
a
private
word
with
you
penny
explained
her
brown
eyes
luminous
with
happiness
he
on
the
front
porch
and
you
ought
to
see
mother
she
looks
like
a
bride
when
dundee
joined
him
on
the
porch
roger
crain
flushed
painfully
but
there
was
happiness
in
his
eyes
too
serena
asked
me
to
thank
you
for
giving
her
penny
message
to
pass
on
to
me
crain
began
in
a
low
voice
i
sure
you
guessed
a
lot
but
what
you
probably
do
know
is
that
serena
used
the
securities
i
had
sent
her
for
safe
keeping
to
play
the
market
with
when
she
knew
what
i
had
done
here
she
would
let
me
touch
a
penny
of
the
money
until
she
had
turned
it
into
enough
to
clear
up
all
my
debts
in
hamilton
then
and
he
sighed
slightly
she
sent
me
home
not
that
i
sorry
i
going
to
try
to
make
margaret
and
penny
happy
make
them
and
the
town
forget
that
i
disgraced
them
through
penny
called
from
the
doorway
and
bonnie
dundee
forgot
tracey
miles
and
all
his
ingenious
schemes
