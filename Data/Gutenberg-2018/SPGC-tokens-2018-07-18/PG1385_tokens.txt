wister
dedication
my
dear
harry
mercer
when
lin
mclean
was
only
a
hero
in
manuscript
he
received
his
first
welcome
and
chastening
beneath
your
patient
roof
by
none
so
much
as
by
you
has
he
in
private
been
helped
and
affectionately
disciplined
an
now
you
must
stand
godfather
to
him
upon
this
public
page
always
yours
owen
wister
philadelphia
how
lin
mclean
went
east
in
the
old
days
the
happy
days
when
wyoming
was
a
territory
with
a
future
instead
of
a
state
with
a
past
and
the
unfenced
cattle
grazed
upon
her
ranges
by
prosperous
thousands
young
lin
mclean
awaked
early
one
morning
in
cow
camp
and
lay
staring
out
of
his
blankets
upon
the
world
he
would
be
this
week
he
was
the
youngest
in
camp
but
because
he
could
break
wild
horses
he
was
earning
more
dollars
a
month
than
any
man
there
except
one
the
cook
was
a
more
indispensable
person
none
save
the
cook
was
up
so
far
this
morning
lin
brother
punchers
slept
about
him
on
the
ground
some
motionless
some
shifting
their
prone
heads
to
burrow
deeper
from
the
increasing
day
the
busy
work
of
spring
was
over
that
of
the
fall
or
beef
not
yet
come
it
was
a
lull
for
these
bachelors
of
the
saddle
and
many
unspent
dollars
stood
to
credit
on
the
ranch
books
what
the
matter
with
some
variety
muttered
the
boy
in
his
blankets
the
long
range
of
the
mountains
lifted
clear
in
the
air
they
slanted
from
the
purple
folds
and
furrows
of
the
pines
that
richly
cloaked
them
upward
into
rock
and
grassy
bareness
until
they
broke
remotely
into
bright
peaks
and
filmed
into
the
distant
lavender
of
the
north
and
the
south
on
their
western
side
the
streams
ran
into
snake
or
into
green
river
and
so
at
length
met
the
pacific
on
this
side
wind
river
flowed
forth
from
them
descending
out
of
the
lake
of
the
painted
meadows
a
mere
it
was
up
there
at
the
top
of
the
divide
with
easy
riffles
and
in
many
places
but
down
here
outside
the
mountains
it
was
become
a
streaming
avenue
a
broadening
course
impetuous
between
its
two
tall
green
walls
of
and
so
it
wound
away
like
a
vast
green
ribbon
across
the
and
the
yellow
vanishing
plains
variety
you
bet
young
lin
repeated
aloud
he
unrolled
himself
from
his
bed
and
brought
from
the
garments
that
made
his
pillow
a
few
toilet
articles
he
got
on
his
long
boy
legs
and
limped
blithely
to
the
margin
in
the
mornings
his
slight
lameness
was
always
more
visible
the
camp
was
at
bull
lake
crossing
where
the
fork
from
bull
lake
joins
wind
river
here
lin
found
some
convenient
with
dark
deepish
water
against
them
where
he
plunged
his
face
and
energetically
washed
and
came
up
with
the
short
curly
hair
shining
upon
his
round
head
after
enough
looks
at
himself
in
the
dark
water
and
having
knotted
a
clean
jaunty
handkerchief
at
his
throat
he
returned
with
his
slight
limp
to
camp
where
they
were
just
sitting
at
breakfast
to
the
rear
of
the
of
the
wagon
bugged
up
to
kill
exclaimed
one
perceiving
lin
careful
dress
he
sure
has
not
shaved
again
another
inquired
with
concern
i
ai
got
my
on
answered
a
third
he
has
spared
that
mustache
said
a
fourth
my
spring
crop
remarked
young
lin
rounding
on
this
last
one
has
juicier
prospects
than
that
catastrophe
of
last
year
hay
which
wanders
out
of
your
why
you
soon
be
talking
yourself
into
a
regular
man
said
the
other
but
the
camp
laugh
remained
on
the
side
of
young
lin
till
breakfast
was
ended
when
the
ranch
foreman
rode
into
camp
him
lin
mclean
at
once
addressed
i
was
wantin
to
speak
to
you
said
he
the
experienced
foreman
noticed
the
boy
holiday
appearance
i
understand

tired
of
work
he
remarked
who
told
you
asked
the
bewildered
lin
the
foreman
touched
the
boy
pretty
handkerchief
well
i
have
a
way
of
taking
things
in
at
a
glance
said
he
that
why
i
foreman
i
expect
so
you
had
enough
work
my
system
full
of
it
replied
lin
grinning
as
the
foreman
stood
thinking
he
added
and
i
like
my
time
in
the
cattle
idiom
meant
up
to
date
it
good
we
not
busy
said
the
foreman
meanin
i
quit
all
the
same
inquired
lin
rapidly
flushing
no
not
meaning
any
offence
catch
up
your
horse
i
want
to
make
the
post
before
it
gets
the
foreman
had
come
down
the
river
from
the
ranch
at
meadow
creek
and
the
post
his
goal
was
fort
washakie
all
this
part
of
the
country
formed
the
shoshone
indian
reservation
where
by
permission
pastured
the
herds
whose
owner
would
pay
lin
his
time
at
washakie
so
the
young
flung
on
his
saddle
and
mounted
he
remarked
to
the
camp
by
way
of
farewell
he
might
never
be
going
to
see
any
of
them
again
but
the
were
not
demonstrative
by
habit
going
to
stop
long
at
washakie
asked
one
alma
is
not
at
the
hotel
now
another
mentioned
if
there
a
new
girl
said
a
third
kiss
her
one
for
me
and
tell
her
i
handsomer
than
i
ai
a
deceiver
of
women
said
lin
that
why
you
tell
her
replied
his
friend
say
lin
why
are
you
quittin
us
so
sudden
anyway
asked
the
cook
grieved
to
lose
him
i
after
some
variety
said
the
boy
if
you
pick
up
more
than
you
can
use
just
can
a
little
of
it
for
me
shouted
the
cook
at
the
departing
mclean
this
was
the
last
of
camp
by
bull
lake
crossing
and
in
the
company
young
lin
now
took
the
road
for
his
accumulated
dollars
so
you
leaving
your
bedding
and
stuff
with
the
outfit
said
the
foreman
brought
my
said
lin
showing
it
in
the
of
his
flannel
shirt
going
to
denver
why
take
in
san
francisco
sounds
made
any
plans
gosh
no
do
want
anything
on
your
brain
nothin
except
my
hat
i
guess
said
lin
and
broke
into
cheerful
song
was
a
nasty
baby
anyhow
and
it
only
died
to
spite
us
was
afflicted
with
the
cerebrow
spinal
meningitis
they
wound
up
out
of
the
magic
valley
of
wind
river
through
the
bastioned
gullies
and
the
mystery
of
dry
upward
and
up
to
the
level
of
the
huge
plain
above
behind
lay
the
deep
valley
they
had
climbed
from
mighty
expanding
its
trees
like
bushes
its
cattle
like
pebbles
its
opposite
side
towering
also
to
the
edge
of
this
upper
plain
there
it
lay
another
world
one
step
farther
away
from
its
rim
and
the
two
edges
of
the
plain
had
flowed
together
over
it
like
a
closing
sea
covering
without
a
sign
or
ripple
the
great
country
which
lay
sunk
beneath
a
man
might
think
he
dreamed
he
saw
that
place
said
lin
to
the
foreman
and
wheeled
his
horse
to
the
edge
again
she
sure
there
though
he
added
gazing
down
for
a
moment
his
boy
face
grew
thoughtful
shucks
said
he
then
abruptly
where
any
joy
in
money
that
comin
till
it
arrives
i
have
most
forgot
the
feel
he
turned
his
horse
away
from
the
vision
of
the
river
and
took
a
sharp
jog
after
the
foreman
who
had
not
been
waiting
for
him
thus
they
crossed
the
eighteen
miles
of
high
plain
and
came
down
to
fort
washakie
in
the
valley
of
little
wind
before
the
day
was
hot
his
roll
of
wages
once
jammed
in
his
pocket
like
an
old
handkerchief
young
lin
precipitated
himself
out
of
the
store
and
away
on
his
horse
up
the
stream
among
the
shoshone
tepees
to
an
unexpected
entertainment
a
he
had
meant
to
go
and
see
what
the
new
at
the
hotel
looked
like
but
put
this
off
promptly
to
attend
the
dance
this
hospitality
the
shoshone
indians
were
extending
to
some
visiting
ute
friends
and
the
neighborhood
was
assembled
to
watch
the
ring
of
painted
naked
savages
the
looked
after
the
galloping
lin
what
he
quitting
his
job
for
he
asked
the
foreman

most
of

satisfactory

a
boy

plumb

bridge
next
time

about
that
mclean

the

highly
spoken

can
hear
him
preach
the
bishop
is
a
good
he
better
than
that
he
a
man
stated
the
foreman
at
least
so
they
tell
now
saving
an
indian
dance
scarce
any
possible
event
at
the
shoshone
agency
could
assemble
in
one
spot
so
many
sorts
of
inhabitants
as
a
visit
from
this
bishop
inhabitants
of
four
colors
gathered
to
view
the
this
afternoon
red
men
white
men
black
men
yellow
men
next
day
three
sorts
came
to
church
at
the
agency
the
chinese
laundry
was
absent
but
because
indeed
as
the
foreman
said
the
bishop
was
not
only
a
good
man
but
a
man
wyoming
held
him
in
respect
and
went
to
look
at
him
he
stood
in
the
agency
church
and
held
the
episcopal
service
this
sunday
morning
for
some
brightly
glittering
army
officers
and
their
families
some
white
cavalry
and
some
black
infantry
the
agency
doctor
the
his
foreman
the
government
scout
three
gamblers
the
from
the
hotel
the
who
was
there
because
she
was
old
chief
washakie
and
royal
in
blankets
with
two
royal
utes
splendid
beside
him
one
benchful
of
squatting
indian
children
silent
and
marvelling
and
on
the
back
bench
the
commanding
officer
new
and
beside
her
lin
mclean
mclean
hours
were
already
various
and
successful
even
at
the
before
he
had
wearied
of
its
monotonous
drumming
and
pageant
his
roving
eye
had
rested
upon
a
girl
whose
eyes
he
caught
resting
upon
him
a
look
an
approach
a
word
and
each
was
soon
content
with
the
other
then
when
her
duties
called
her
to
the
post
from
him
and
the
stream
border
with
a
promise
for
next
day
he
sought
the
hotel
and
found
the
three
gamblers
anxious
to
make
his
acquaintance
for
when
a
has
his
pay
many
people
will
take
an
interest
in
him
the
three
gamblers
did
not
know
that
mclean
could
play
cards
he
left
them
late
in
the
evening
fat
with
their
money
and
sought
the
tepees
of
the
arapahoes
they
lived
across
the
road
from
the
shoshones
and
among
their
tents
the
boy
remained
until
morning
he
was
here
in
church
now
keeping
his
promise
to
see
the
bishop
with
the
girl
of
yesterday
and
while
he
gravely
looked
at
the
bishop
miss
sabina
stone
allowed
his
arm
to
encircle
her
waist
no
soldier
had
achieved
this
yet
but
lin
was
the
first
she
had
seen
and
he
had
given
her
the
handkerchief
from
round
his
neck
the
quiet
air
blew
in
through
the
windows
and
door
the
pure
light
breath
from
the
mountains
only
passing
over
their
it
had
caught
and
carried
the
clear
aroma
of
the
this
it
brought
into
church
and
with
this
seemed
also
to
float
the
peace
and
great
silence
of
the
plains
the
little
melodeon
in
the
corner
played
by
one
of
the
ladies
at
the
post
had
finished
accompanying
the
hymn
and
now
it
prolonged
a
few
closing
chords
while
the
bishop
paused
before
his
address
resting
his
keen
eyes
on
the
people
he
was
dressed
in
a
plain
suit
of
black
with
a
narrow
black
tie
this
was
because
the
union
pacific
railroad
while
it
had
delivered
him
correctly
at
green
river
had
despatched
his
robes
towards
cheyenne
without
citing
chapter
and
verse
the
bishop
began
and
he
arose
and
came
to
his
father
but
when
he
was
yet
a
great
way
off
his
father
saw
him
and
had
compassion
and
ran
and
fell
on
his
neck
and
kissed
the
bishop
told
the
story
of
that
surpassing
parable
and
then
proceeded
to
draw
from
it
a
discourse
fitted
to
the
drifting
destinies
in
whose
presence
he
found
himself
for
one
solitary
morning
he
spoke
unlike
many
clergymen
his
words
were
chiefly
those
which
the
people
round
him
used
and
his
voice
was
more
like
earnest
talking
than
preaching
miss
sabina
stone
felt
the
arm
of
her
loosen
slightly
and
she
looked
at
him
but
he
was
looking
at
the
bishop
no
longer
gravely
but
with
eyes
alert
when
the
narrative
reached
the
elder
brother
in
the
field
and
how
he
came
to
the
house
and
heard
sounds
of
music
and
dancing
miss
stone
drew
away
from
her
companion
and
let
him
watch
the
bishop
since
he
seemed
to
prefer
that
she
took
to
reading
hymns
vindictively
the
bishop
himself
noted
the
boy
face
and
the
eyes
he
was
too
far
away
to
see
anything
but
the
alert
listening
position
of
the
young
he
could
not
discern
how
that
after
he
had
left
the
music
and
dancing
and
begun
to
draw
morals
attention
faded
from
those
eyes
that
seemed
to
watch
him
and
they
filled
with
dreaminess
it
was
very
hot
in
church
chief
washakie
went
to
sleep
and
so
did
a
corporal
but
lin
mclean
sat
in
the
same
alert
position
till
miss
stone
pulled
him
and
asked
if
he
intended
to
sit
down
through
the
hymn
then
church
was
out
officers
indians
and
all
the
people
dispersed
through
the
great
sunshine
to
their
dwellings
and
the
rode
beside
sabina
in
silence
what
are
you
studying
over
mclean
inquired
the
lady
after
a
hundred
yards
did
you
ever
taste
steamed
duxbury
clams
asked
lin
absently
no
indeed
what
them
oh
just
clams
yu
have
drawn
butter
mclean
fell
silent
again
i
guess
i
be
late
for
settin
the
colonel
table
said
sabina
quickly
and
swished
her
whip
across
the
pony
who
scampered
away
with
her
along
the
straight
road
across
the
plain
to
the
post
lin
caught
up
with
her
at
once
and
made
his
peace
only
protested
sabina
i
ai
used
to
gentlemen
taking
me
out
and
well
same
as
if
i
was
a
maybe
it
wind
river
but
she
went
riding
with
him
up
trout
creek
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
out
of
the
indian
tepees
scattered
wide
among
the
flat
levels
of
smoke
rose
thin
and
gentle
and
vanished
they
splashed
across
the
many
little
running
channels
which
lead
water
through
that
thirsty
soil
and
though
the
range
of
mountains
came
no
nearer
behind
them
the
post
with
its
white
flat
buildings
and
green
trees
dwindled
to
a
toy
village
my
but
it
far
to
everywheres
here
exclaimed
sabina
and
little
you
sayin
for
yourself
mclean
i
have
to
do
the
talking
what
that
thing
now
where
the
rocks
are
that
little
wind
river
canyon
said
the
young
man
feel
like
there
miss
stone
why
yes
it
looks
real
nice
and
shady
like
do
it
so
miss
stone
turned
her

his
hazel
eyes
smiling
upon
her
that

twenty
miles

hour

i
ai

i
do
want

go
if
yu
was
desirous
of
out
mr
mclean
indeed
and
i
do
no
such
thing
and
sabina
giggled
a
rose
under
their
horses
feet
and
hurtled
away
heavily
over
the
next
rise
of
ground
taking
a
final
wide
sail
out
of
sight
something
like
them
partridges
used
to
said
lin
musingly
partridges
inquired
sabina
used
to
be
in
the
woods
between
lynn
and
salem
maybe
the
woods
are
gone
by
this
time
yes
they
must
be
gone
i
presently
they
dismounted
and
sought
the
stream
bank
we
had
music
and
dancing
at
thanksgiving
and
such
times
said
lin
his
wiry
length
stretched
on
the
grass
beside
the
seated
sabina
he
was
not
looking
at
her
but
she
took
a
pleasure
in
watching
him
his
curly
head
and
bronze
face
against
which
the
young
mustache
showed
to
its
full
advantage
i
expect
you
used
to
dance
a
lot
remarked
sabina
for
a
subject
yes
do
yu
know
the
portland
fancy
sabina
did
not
and
her
subject
died
away
did
anybody
ever
tell
you
you
had
good
eyes
she
inquired
next
why
sure
said
lin
waking
for
a
moment
but
i
like
your
color
best
a
girl
eyes
will
mostly
beat
a
indeed
i
do
think
so
exclaimed
poor
sabina
too
much
expectant
to
perceive
the
fatal
note
of
routine
with
which
her
transient
admirer
pronounced
this
gallantry
he
informed
her
that
hers
were
like
the
sea
and
she
told
him
she
had
not
yet
looked
upon
the
sea
never
said
he
it
a
turruble
pity
you
never
saw
salt
water
it
different
from
fresh
all
around
home
it
blue
awful
blue
in
july
around
swampscott
and
marblehead
and
nahant
and
around
the
islands
i
swam
there
lots
then
our
home
bruck
up
and
we
went
to
board
in
he
snapped
off
a
flower
in
reach
of
his
long
arm
suddenly
all
dreaminess
left
him
i
wonder
if
you
be
settin
the
colonel
table
when
i
come
back
he
said
miss
stone
was
at
a
loss
i
goin
east
east
to
yesterday
he
had
told
her
that
sixteen
miles
to
lander
was
the
farthest
journey
from
the
post
that
he
intended
to
make
the
farthest
from
the
post
and
her
i
hope
nothing
ai
happened
to
your
folks
said
she
i
ai
got
no
folks
replied
lin
barring
a
brother
i
expect
he
is
taking
good
care
of
do
you
correspond
well
i
guess
he
would
if
there
was
anything
to
say
there
ai
been
sabina
thought
they
must
have
quarrelled
but
learned
that
they
had
not
it
was
time
for
her
now
to
return
and
set
the
colonel
table
so
lin
rose
and
went
to
bring
her
horse
when
he
had
put
her
in
her
saddle
she
noticed
him
step
to
his
own
why
i
did
know
you
were
lame
cried
she
shucks
said
lin
it
do
cramp
my
style
he
had
sprung
on
his
horse
ridden
beside
her
leaned
and
kissed
her
before
she
got
any
measure
of
his
activity
that
how
said
he
and
they
took
their
homeward
way
galloping
no
lin
continued
frank
and
me
never
quarrelled
i
just
thought
i
have
a
look
at
this
western
country
frank
he
thought
was
good
enough
for
him
and
so
we
both
satisfied
i
expect
and
that
a
lot
of
years
now
whoop
ye
he
suddenly
sang
out
and
fired
his
at
a
who
strung
himself
out
flat
and
flew
over
the
earth
both
dismounted
at
the
gate
and
he
kissed
her
again
when
she
was
not
looking
upon
which
she
very
properly
slapped
him
and
he
took
the
horses
to
the
stable
he
sat
down
to
tea
at
the
hotel
and
found
the
meal
consisted
of
black
potatoes
gray
tea
and
a
guttering
dish
of
fat
pork
but
his
appetite
was
good
and
he
remarked
to
himself
that
inside
the
first
hour
he
was
in
boston
he
would
have
steamed
duxbury
clams
of
sabina
he
never
thought
again
and
it
is
likely
that
she
found
others
to
take
his
place
fort
washakie
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
the
railway
and
men
there
were
many
and
girls
were
few
the
next
morning
the
other
passengers
entered
the
stage
with
resignation
knowing
the
hours
of
evil
that
lay
before
them
lin
climbed
up
beside
the
driver
he
had
a
new
trunk
now
do
get
full
lin
said
the
clerk
putting
the
in
at
the
store
my
plans
ai
settled
that
far
yet
replied
mclean
leave
it
out
of
them
said
the
voice
of
the
bishop
laughing
inside
the
stage
it
was
a
cool
fine
air
gazing
over
the
huge
plain
down
in
which
lies
fort
washakie
lin
heard
the
faint
notes
of
the
trumpet
on
the
parade
ground
and
took
a
look
at
all
things
he
watched
the
american
flag
grow
small
saw
the
circle
of
steam
rising
away
down
by
the
hot
springs
looked
at
the
bad
lands
beyond
chemically
pink
and
rose
amid
the
vast
natural
plain
across
the
spreading
distance
indians
trotted
at
wide
spaces
generally
two
large
bucks
on
one
small
pony
or
a
squaw
and
pappoose
a
bundle
of
rags
presiding
over
the
whole
rose
the
mountains
to
the
west
serene
lifting
into
the
clearest
light
then
once
again
came
the
now
tiny
music
of
the
trumpet
when
do
yu
figure
on
comin
back
inquired
the
driver
oh
i
just
look
around
back
there
for
a
spell
said
lin
about
a
month
i
he
had
seven
hundred
dollars
at
lander
the
horses
are
changed
and
during
this
operation
lin
friends
gathered
and
said
where
was
any
sense
in
going
to
boston
when
you
could
have
a
good
time
where
you
were
but
lin
remained
sitting
safe
on
the
stage
toward
evening
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
dry
gulch
some
eight
feet
deep
the
horses
decided
it
was
a
suitable
place
to
stay
it
was
the
bishop
who
persuaded
them
to
change
their
minds
he
told
the
driver
to
give
up
beating
and
unharness
then
they
were
led
up
the
bank
quivering
and
a
broken
trace
was
spliced
with
rope
then
the
stage
was
forced
on
to
the
level
ground
the
bishop
proving
a
strong
man
familiar
with
the
gear
of
vehicles
they
crossed
through
the
pass
among
the
quaking
asps
and
the
pines
and
reaching
pacific
springs
came
down
again
into
open
country
that
afternoon
the
stage
put
its
passengers
down
on
the
railroad
platform
at
green
river
this
was
the
route
in
those
days
before
the
catastrophes
of
frozen
passengers
led
to
its
abandonment
the
bishop
was
going
west
his
robes
had
passed
him
on
the
up
stage
during
the
night
when
the
reverend
gentleman
heard
this
he
was
silent
for
a
very
short
moment
and
then
laughed
vigorously
in
the
i
can
understand
how
you
swear
sometimes
he
said
to
lin
mclean
but
i
ca
you
see
not
even
at
the
was
checking
his
own
trunk
to
omaha
and
good
luck
to
you
continued
the
bishop
giving
his
hand
to
lin
and
look
here
do
you
think
you
might
leave
that
full
out
of
your
plans
lin
gave
a
slightly
shamefaced
grin
i
do
guess
i
can
sir
he
said
i
givin
yu
straight
goods
yu
see
he
added
that
right
but
you
look
like
a
man
who
could
stop
when
he
had
enough
try
that
you
man
enough
and
come
and
see
me
whenever
in
the
same
he
went
to
the
hotel
there
were
several
hours
for
lin
to
wait
he
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
till
the
stars
came
out
and
the
bright
lights
of
the
town
shone
in
the
saloon
windows
over
across
the
way
sounded
through
one
of
the
many
open
doors
wonder
if
the
professor
there
yet
said
lin
and
he
went
across
the
railroad
tracks
the
bartender
nodded
to
him
as
he
passed
through
into
the
back
room
in
that
place
were
many
tables
and
the
flat
clicking
and
rattle
of
ivory
counters
sounded
pleasantly
through
the
music
lin
did
not
join
the
game
he
stood
over
a
table
at
which
sat
a
dealer
and
a
player
very
silent
opposite
each
other
and
whereon
were
painted
sundry
cards
numerals
and
the
colors
red
and
black
in
squares
the
legend
jacks
pay
was
also
clearly
painted
the
player
placed
chips
on
whichever
insignia
of
fortune
he
chose
and
the
dealer
slid
cards
quite
fairly
from
the
top
of
a
pack
that
lay
held
within
a
skeleton
case
made
with
some
clamped
bands
of
tin
sometimes
the
player
pile
of
chips
rose
high
and
sometimes
his
sumptuous
pillar
of
gold
pieces
was
lessened
by
one
it
was
very
interesting
and
pretty
to
see
lin
had
much
better
have
joined
the
game
of
presently
the
eye
of
the
dealer
met
the
eye
of
the
player
after
that
slight
incident
the
player
chip
pile
began
to
rise
and
rose
steadily
till
the
dealer
made
admiring
comments
on
such
a
run
of
luck
then
the
player
stopped
cashed
in
and
said
having
nearly
doubled
the
number
of
his
gold
pieces
five
dollars
worth
said
lin
sitting
down
in
the
vacant
seat
the
chips
were
counted
out
to
him
he
played
with
unimportant
shiftings
of
fortune
until
a
short
while
before
his
train
was
due
and
then
singularly
enough
he
discovered
he
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
behind
the
game
i
guess
i
leave
the
train
go
without
me
said
lin
buying
five
dollars
worth
more
of
ivory
counters
so
that
train
came
and
went
removing
eastward
mclean
trunk
during
the
hour
that
followed
his
voice
grew
dogged
and
his
remarks
briefer
as
he
continually
purchased
more
chips
from
the
now
surprised
and
sympathetic
dealer
it
was
really
wonderful
how
steadily
lin
lost
just
as
steadily
as
his
predecessor
had
won
after
that
meeting
of
eyes
early
in
the
evening
when
lin
was
three
hundred
dollars
out
his
voice
began
to
clear
of
its
huskiness
and
a
slight
humor
revolved
and
sparkled
in
his
eye
when
his
seven
hundred
dollars
had
gone
to
safer
hands
and
he
had
nothing
left
at
all
but
some
silver
fractions
of
a
dollar
his
robust
cheerfulness
was
all
back
again
he
walked
out
and
stood
among
the
railroad
tracks
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
laughed
at
himself
in
the
dark
then
his
fingers
came
on
the
check
for
omaha
and
he
laughed
loudly
the
trunk
by
this
hour
must
be
nearing
rawlins
it
was
going
east
anyhow
i
following
it
you
bet
he
declared
kicking
the
rail
not
yet
though
nor
i
not
go
to
washakie
to
have
josh
me
and
yonder
lays
he
stretched
his
arm
and
pointed
eastward
had
he
seen
another
man
going
on
in
this
fashion
alone
in
the
dark
among
freight
cars
he
would
have
pitied
the
poor
fool
and
i
guess
have
to
get
along
without
me
for
a
spell
too
continued
lin
a
man
do
want
to
show
up
plumb
broke
like
that
younger
son
did
after
with
the
hogs
the
bishop
told
about
his
father
was
a
that
hog
chap
hustled
around
and
set
up
when
he
come
back
home
frank
he
say
to
me
do
you
do
brother
and
he
be
wearin
a
good
suit
o
clothes
and
no
sir
you
bet
lin
now
watched
the
great
headlight
of
a
freight
train
bearing
slowly
down
into
green
river
from
the
wilderness
green
river
is
the
end
of
a
division
an
epoch
in
every
train
journey
lanterns
swung
signals
the
great
dim
thing
slowed
to
its
standstill
by
the
coal
chute
its
locomotive
moved
away
for
a
turn
of
repose
the
successor
backed
steaming
to
its
place
to
tackle
a
night
work
cars
were
shifted
heavily
bumping
and
parting
hello
lin
a
face
was
looking
from
the
window
of
the
caboose
hello
responded
mclean
perceiving
above
his
head
honey
wiggin
a
good
friend
of
his
they
had
not
met
for
three
years
they
claimed
you
got
killed
somewheres
i
was
sorry
to
hear
honey
offered
his
condolence
quite
sincerely
bruck
my
leg
corrected
lin
if
that
what
they
i
expect
that
it
said
honey
you
had
no
other
trouble
been
boomin
said
lin
from
the
mere
undertone
in
their
voices
it
was
plain
they
were
good
friends
carefully
hiding
their
pleasure
at
meeting
wher
yu
bound
inquired
honey
east
said
lin
better
jump
in
here
then
we
goin
that
just
suits
me
said
lin
the
busy
lanterns
wagged
among
the
switches
the
steady
lights
of
the
saloons
shone
along
the
town
wooden
facade
from
the
bluffs
that
wall
green
river
the
sweet
clean
wind
blew
down
in
currents
freshly
through
the
a
wrench
passed
through
the
train
from
locomotive
to
caboose
each
fettered
car
in
turn
strained
into
motion
and
slowly
rolled
over
the
bridge
and
into
silence
from
the
steam
and
the
bells
of
the
railroad
yard
through
the
open
windows
of
the
caboose
great
cinders
rattled
in
and
the
whistles
of
distant
union
pacific
locomotives
sounded
over
the
open
plains
ominous
and
long
like
ships
at
sea
honey
and
lin
sat
for
a
while
making
few
observations
and
far
between
as
their
way
is
between
whom
flows
a
stream
of
understanding
mutual
whiskey
and
silence
can
express
much
friendship
and
eloquently
what
are
yu
doing
at
present
lin
inquired
now
prospecting
means
hunting
gold
except
to
such
spirits
as
the
boy
lin
to
these
it
means
finding
gold
so
lin
mclean
listened
to
the
talk
of
his
friend
honey
wiggin
as
the
caboose
trundled
through
the
night
he
saw
himself
in
a
vision
of
the
near
future
enter
a
bank
and
thump
down
a
bag
of
then
he
saw
the
new
clean
money
the
man
would
hand
him
in
exchange
bills
with
round
zeroes
half
covered
by
being
folded
over
and
heavy
satisfactory
gold
pieces
and
then
he
saw
the
blue
water
that
twinkles
beneath
boston
his
fingers
came
again
on
his
trunk
check
he
had
his
ticket
too
and
as
dawn
now
revealed
the
gray
country
to
him
his
eye
fell
casually
upon
a
omaha
he
began
to
watch
for
them
but
the
trunk
would
really
get
to
omaha
what
are
yu
laughin
about
asked
honey
oh
the
wheels
do
yu
hear
said
lin
they
keep
variety
huh
said
honey
with
scorn
all
i
make
you
no
poet
observed
mclean
as
the
train
moved
into
evanston
in
the
sunlight
a
gleam
of
dismay
shot
over
lin
face
and
he
ducked
his
head
out
of
sight
of
the
window
but
immediately
raised
it
again
then
he
leaned
out
waving
his
arm
with
a
certain
defiant
vigor
but
the
bishop
on
the
platform
failed
to
notice
this
performance
though
it
was
done
for
his
sole
benefit
nor
would
lin
explain
to
the
inquisitive
wiggin
what
the
matter
was
therefore
very
naturally
honey
drew
a
conclusion
for
himself
looked
quickly
out
of
the
window
and
being
disappointed
in
what
he
expected
to
see
remarked
sulkily
do
yu
figure
i
care
what
sort
of
a
lookin
girl
is
stuck
on
yu
in
evanston
and
upon
this
young
lin
laughed
so
loudly
that
his
friend
told
him
he
had
never
seen
a
man
get
so
foolish
in
three
years
they
were
in
utah
and
in
the
company
of
ogden
friends
forgot
prospecting
later
they
resumed
freight
trains
and
journeyed
north
in
idaho
they
said
to
the
train
hands
in
the
caboose
and
came
to
little
camas
and
so
among
the
mountains
near
feather
creek
here
the
berries
were
of
several
sorts
and
growing
riper
each
day
and
the
bears
in
the
timber
above
knew
this
and
came
down
punctually
with
the
season
making
variety
in
the
otherwise
even
life
of
the
prospectors
it
was
now
august
and
lin
sat
on
a
wet
hill
making
for
sixty
days
but
the
philosopher
stone
was
not
in
the
wash
at
that
placer
nor
did
lin
gather
sufficient
to
cover
the
nail
of
his
thumb
then
they
heard
of
an
excitement
at
obo
nevada
and
hurrying
to
obo
they
made
some
more
now
and
then
eating
their
fat
bacon
at
noon
honey
would
say
lin
wher
yu
goin
and
lin
always
replied
this
became
a
signal
for
drinks
for
beauty
and
promise
nevada
is
a
name
among
names
nevada
pronounce
the
word
aloud
does
it
not
evoke
mountains
and
clear
air
heights
of
untrodden
snow
and
valleys
aromatic
with
the
pine
and
musical
with
falling
waters
nevada
but
the
name
is
all
abomination
of
desolation
presides
over
of
the
place
the
sun
beats
down
as
on
a
roof
of
zinc
fierce
and
dull
not
a
drop
of
water
to
a
mile
of
sand
the
mean
landscape
stretches
on
from
nowhere
to
nowhere
a
spot
of
mange
no
portion
of
the
earth
is
more
lacquered
with
paltry
unimportant
ugliness
there
is
gold
in
nevada
but
lin
and
honey
did
not
find
it
prospecting
of
the
sort
they
did
besides
proving
unfruitful
is
not
comfortable
now
and
again
losing
patience
lin
would
leave
his
work
and
stalk
about
and
gaze
down
at
the
scattered
men
who
stooped
or
knelt
in
the
water
passing
each
busy
prospector
lin
would
read
on
every
broad
upturned
pair
of
overalls
the
same
label
levi
strauss
no
with
a
picture
of
two
lusty
horses
hitched
to
one
of
these
garments
and
vainly
struggling
to
split
them
asunder
lin
remembered
he
was
wearing
a
label
just
like
that
too
and
when
he
considered
all
things
he
laughed
to
himself
then
having
stretched
the
ache
out
of
his
long
legs
he
would
return
to
his
ditch
as
autumn
wore
on
his
feet
grew
cold
in
the
mushy
gravel
they
were
sunk
in
he
beat
off
the
sand
that
had
stiffened
on
his
boots
and
hated
obo
nevada
but
he
held
himself
ready
to
say
east
whenever
he
saw
honey
coming
along
with
the
bottle
the
cold
weather
put
an
end
to
this
adventure
the
ditches
froze
and
filled
with
snow
through
which
the
sordid
gravel
heaps
showed
in
a
dreary
fashion
so
the
two
friends
drifted
southward
near
the
small
new
town
of
mesa
arizona
they
sat
down
again
in
the
dirt
it
was
milder
here
and
when
the
sun
shone
never
quite
froze
but
this
part
of
arizona
is
scarcely
more
grateful
to
the
eye
than
nevada
moreover
lin
and
honey
found
no
gold
at
all
some
men
near
them
found
a
little
then
in
january
even
though
the
sun
shone
it
quite
froze
one
day
we
seein
the
country
anyway
said
honey
seein
hell
said
lin
and
there
more
of
it
above
ground
than
i
what
we
do
honey
inquired
have
to
walk
for
a
job
a
job
responded
the
hopeful
and
he
and
honey
went
to
town
lin
found
a
job
in
minutes
becoming
assistant
to
the
apothecary
in
mesa
established
at
the
he
made
up
the
simpler
prescriptions
he
had
studied
practical
pharmacy
in
boston
between
the
ages
of
thirteen
and
fifteen
and
besides
this
qualification
the
apothecary
had
seen
him
when
he
first
came
into
mesa
and
liked
him
lin
made
no
mistakes
that
he
or
any
one
ever
knew
of
and
as
the
mild
weather
began
he
materially
increased
the
business
by
persuading
him
to
send
east
for
a
fountain
the
ladies
of
the
town
clustered
around
this
entertaining
novelty
and
while
sipping
vanilla
and
lemon
bought
knickknacks
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
town
discovered
that
whiskey
with
soda
and
strawberry
syrup
was
delicious
and
produced
just
as
competent
effects
a
group
of
them
were
generally
standing
in
the
shop
and
shaking
dice
to
decide
who
should
pay
for
the
next
while
lin
administered
to
each
glass
the
necessary
ingredients
thus
money
began
to
come
to
him
a
little
more
steadily
than
had
been
its
wont
and
he
divided
with
the
penniless
honey
but
honey
found
fortune
quickly
too
through
excellent
he
won
a
pinto
from
a
small
mexican
who
came
into
town
from
the
south
and
who
cried
bitterly
when
he
delivered
up
his
pet
pony
to
the
new
owner
the
new
owner
being
a
man
of
the
world
and
agile
on
his
feet
was
only
slightly
stabbed
that
evening
as
he
walked
to
the
at
the
edge
of
the
town
the
mexican
was
buried
on
the
next
day
but
one
the
pony
stood
thirteen
two
and
was
as
long
as
a
steamboat
he
had
white
eyelashes
pink
nostrils
and
one
eye
was
bright
blue
if
you
spoke
pleasantly
to
him
he
rose
instantly
on
his
and
tried
to
beat
your
face
he
did
not
look
as
if
he
could
run
and
that
was
what
made
him
so
valuable
honey
travelled
through
the
country
with
him
and
every
gentleman
who
saw
the
pinto
and
heard
honey
became
anxious
to
get
up
a
race
lin
always
sent
money
for
wiggin
to
place
and
he
soon
opened
a
bank
account
while
honey
besides
his
bought
a
one
a
pair
of
spurs
and
a
beautiful
saddle
richly
stamped
every
day
when
in
mesa
honey
would
step
into
the
and
inquire
lin
wher
yu
goin
but
lin
never
answered
any
more
he
merely
came
to
the
fountain
with
the
whiskey
the
passing
of
days
brought
a
choked
season
of
fine
sand
and
hard
blazing
sky
heat
rose
up
from
the
ground
and
hung
heavily
over
man
and
beast
many
insects
sat
out
in
the
sun
rattling
with
joy
the
little
tearing
river
grew
clear
from
the
swollen
mud
and
shrank
to
a
succession
of
standing
pools
and
the
fat
squatting
cactus
bloomed
everywhere
into
flowers
big
as
tulips
in
the
sand
there
were
artesian
wells
in
mesa
and
the
water
did
not
taste
very
good
but
if
you
drank
from
the
standing
pools
where
the
river
had
been
you
repaired
to
the
almost
immediately
a
troop
of
wandering
players
came
dotting
along
the
railroad
and
reaching
mesa
played
a
up
and
down
the
street
and
announced
the
powerful
drama
of
east
then
mclean
thought
of
the
lynn
marshes
that
lie
between
there
and
chelsea
and
of
the
sea
that
must
look
so
cool
he
forgot
them
while
following
the
painful
fortunes
of
the
lady
isabel
but
going
to
bed
in
the
back
part
of
the
he
remembered
how
he
used
to
beat
everybody
swimming
in
the
salt
water
i
goin
he
said
then
he
got
up
and
striking
the
light
he
inspected
his
bank
account
i
sure
goin
he
repeated
blowing
the
light
out
and
i
can
buy
the
fatted
calf
myself
you
bet
for
he
had
often
thought
of
the
bishop
story
you
bet
he
remarked
once
more
in
a
muffled
voice
and
was
asleep
in
a
minute
the
apothecary
was
sorry
to
have
him
go
and
honey
was
deeply
grieved
i
pull
out
with
yer
he
said
only
i
can
do
business
round
yuma
and
westward
with
the
for
three
farewell
days
lin
and
honey
roved
together
in
all
sorts
of
places
where
they
were
welcome
and
once
more
lin
rode
a
horse
and
was
in
his
native
element
then
he
travelled
to
deming
and
so
through
denver
to
omaha
where
he
was
told
that
his
trunk
had
been
sold
for
some
months
besides
a
suit
of
clothes
for
town
wear
it
had
contained
a
buffalo
coat
for
his
brother
something
scarce
to
see
in
these
days
frank
have
to
get
along
without
it
he
observed
philosophically
and
took
the
next
eastbound
train
if
you
journey
in
a
pullman
from
mesa
to
omaha
without
a
waistcoat
and
with
a
silk
handkerchief
knotted
over
the
collar
of
your
flannel
shirt
instead
of
a
tie
wearing
besides
tall
boots
a
soft
gray
hat
with
a
splendid
brim
a
few
people
will
notice
you
but
not
the
majority
new
mexico
and
colorado
are
used
to
these
things
as
iowa
with
its
immense
rolling
grain
encompasses
you
people
will
stare
a
little
more
for
you
getting
near
the
east
where
are
not
understood
but
in
those
days
the
line
of
cleavage
came
at
chicago
west
of
there
was
still
tolerably
west
but
east
of
there
was
east
indeed
and
the
atlantic
ocean
was
the
next
important
in
lin
new
train
good
gloves
and
silence
prevailed
throughout
the
which
was
for
boston
without
change
had
not
home
memories
begun
impetuously
to
flood
his
mind
he
would
have
felt
himself
conspicuous
town
clothes
and
conventions
had
their
due
value
with
him
but
just
now
the
thoughts
were
far
from
any
surroundings
and
he
was
murmuring
to
himself
tomorrow
night
there
were
ladies
in
that
blue
plush
car
for
boston
who
looked
at
lin
for
thirty
miles
at
a
stretch
and
by
the
time
albany
was
reached
the
next
day
one
or
two
of
them
commented
that
he
was
the
most
man
they
had
ever
seen
whereas
beyond
his
tallness
and
jocular
eyes
eyes
that
seemed
those
of
a
not
highly
conscientious
wild
animal
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
young
lin
except
stage
effect
the
conductor
had
been
annoyed
to
have
such
a
passenger
but
the
troubled
no
one
and
was
extremely
silent
so
evidently
was
he
a
piece
of
the
true
frontier
that
curious
and
hopeful
after
watching
him
with
diversion
more
than
once
took
a
seat
next
to
him
he
met
their
chatty
inquiries
with
monosyllables
so
few
and
so
unprofitable
in
their
quiet
politeness
that
the
passengers
soon
gave
him
up
at
springfield
he
sent
a
telegram
to
his
brother
at
the
great
establishment
that
employed
him
the
train
began
its
homestretch
after
worcester
and
whirled
and
swung
by
hills
and
ponds
he
began
to
watch
for
and
through
stations
with
old
wayside
names
these
flashed
on
lin
eye
as
he
sat
with
his
hat
off
and
his
forehead
against
the
window
looking
wellesley
then
not
long
after
riverside
that
was
the
charles
river
and
did
the
picnic
woods
used
to
be
above
the
bridge
or
below
west
newton
newtonville
newton
faneuil
next
he
said
aloud
in
the
car
as
the
shone
forth
in
his
recollection
the
traveller
seated
near
said
beg
pardon
but
turning
wondered
at
the
lin
with
his
forehead
pressed
against
the
glass
the
blue
water
flashed
into
sight
and
soon
after
they
were
running
in
the
darkness
between
high
walls
but
the
never
moved
though
nothing
could
be
seen
when
the
porter
announced
boston
he
started
up
and
followed
like
a
sheep
in
the
general
exodus
down
on
the
platform
he
moved
along
with
the
slow
crowd
till
some
one
touched
him
and
wheeling
round
he
seized
both
his
brother
hands
and
swore
a
good
oath
of
joy
there
they
stood
the
long
brown
fellow
with
the
silk
handkerchief
knotted
over
his
flannel
shirt
greeting
tremendously
the
spruce
civilian
who
had
a
mustache
and
bore
a
fainthearted
resemblance
to
him
the
story
was
plain
on
its
face
to
the
and
one
of
the
ladies
who
had
come
in
the
car
with
lin
turned
twice
and
smiled
gently
to
herself
but
frank
mclean
heart
did
not
warm
he
felt
that
what
he
had
been
afraid
of
was
true
and
he
saw
he
was
being
made
conspicuous
he
saw
men
and
women
stare
in
the
station
and
he
saw
them
staring
as
he
and
his
western
brother
went
through
the
streets
lin
strode
along
sniffing
the
air
of
boston
looking
at
all
things
and
making
it
a
stretch
for
his
sleek
companion
to
keep
step
with
him
frank
thought
of
the
refined
friends
he
should
have
to
introduce
his
brother
to
for
he
had
risen
with
his
salary
and
now
belonged
to
a
small
club
where
the
of
banks
played
cards
every
night
and
the
head
clerk
at
the
parker
house
was
president
perhaps
he
should
not
have
to
reveal
the
to
these
shining
ones
perhaps
the
would
not
stay
very
long
of
course
he
was
glad
to
see
him
again
and
he
would
take
him
to
dine
at
some
obscure
place
this
first
evening
but
this
was
not
lin
plan
frank
must
dine
with
him
at
the
parker
house
frank
demurred
saying
it
was
he
that
should
be
host
and
he
added
they
charge
up
high
for
wines
at
then
for
the
twentieth
time
he
shifted
a
sidelong
eye
over
his
brother
clothes
you
goin
to
take
your
grub
with
me
said
lin
that
all
right
i
guess
and
there
ai
any
about
it
things
is
not
the
same
like
as
if
father
was
livin
his
voice
softened
and
here
to
see
me
come
home
now
i
good
for
several
dinners
with
wines
charged
up
high
i
expect
nor
it
ai
nobody
in
this
world
barrin
just
lin
mclean
that
i
any
need
to
ask
for
anything
mclean
says
i
to
lin
yu
spare
me
some
cash
to
be
sure
you
bet
and
we
start
off
with
steamed
duxbury
the
slapped
his
pocket
where
the
coin
made
a
muffled
chinking
then
he
said
gruffly
i
suppose
swampscott
there
yet
yes
said
frank
it
a
dead
little
town
is
i
guess
i
take
a
look
at
the
old
house
tomorrow
lin
pursued
oh
that
been
pulled
down
since
i
forget
the
year
they
improved
that
lin
regarded
in
silence
his
brother
who
was
speaking
so
jauntily
of
the
first
and
last
home
they
had
ever
had
is
when
it
was
continued
frank
so
you
can
save
the
trouble
of
travelling
away
down
to
i
guess
i
go
to
the
graveyard
anyway
said
the
in
his
offish
voice
and
looking
fixedly
in
front
of
him
they
came
into
washington
street
and
again
the
elder
mclean
uneasily
surveyed
the
younger
appearance
but
the
momentary
chill
had
melted
from
the
heart
of
the
genial
lin
after
said
he
laying
a
hand
on
his
brother
shoulder
yu
can
start
any
lead
yu
please
and
i
guess
i
can
stay
with
pretty
close
frank
said
nothing
he
saw
one
of
the
members
of
his
club
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
and
the
member
saw
him
and
frank
caught
diverted
amazement
on
the
member
face
lin
hand
weighed
on
his
shoulder
and
the
stress
became
too
great
lin
said
he
while
you
running
with
our
crowd
you
do
want
to
wear
that
style
of
hat
you
it
may
be
that
such
words
can
in
some
way
be
spoken
at
such
a
time
but
not
in
the
way
that
these
were
said
the
frozen
fact
was
irrevocably
revealed
in
the
tone
of
frank
voice
the
stopped
dead
short
and
his
hand
slid
off
his
shoulder
you
made
it
plain
he
said
evenly
slanting
his
steady
eyes
down
into
frank
you
explained
yourself
fairly
well
run
along
with
your
crowd
and
i
not
bother
yu
more
with
comin
round
and
causin
yu
to
feel
ashamed
it
a
heap
better
to
understand
these
things
at
once
and
save
making
a
fool
of
yourself
any
longer
need
to
i
guess
there
ai
no
more
to
be
said
only
one
thing
if
see
me
around
on
the
street
do
yu
try
any
talk
for
i
be
liable
to
close
your
jaw
up
and
maybe
yu
have
more
of
a
job
explainin
that
to
your
crowd
than
you
had
makin
me
see
what
kind
of
a
man
i
got
for
a
frank
found
himself
standing
alone
before
any
reply
to
these
sentences
had
occurred
to
him
he
walked
slowly
to
his
club
where
a
friend
joked
him
on
his
glumness
lin
made
a
sore
failure
of
amusing
himself
that
night
and
in
the
bright
hot
morning
he
got
into
the
train
for
swampscott
at
the
graveyard
he
saw
a
woman
lay
a
bunch
of
flowers
on
a
mound
and
kneel
weeping
there
ai
nobody
to
do
that
for
this
one
thought
the
and
looked
down
at
the
grave
he
had
come
to
see
then
absently
gazed
at
the
woman
she
had
stolen
away
from
her
daily
life
to
come
here
where
her
grief
was
shrined
and
now
her
heart
found
it
hard
to
bid
the
lonely
place
goodbye
so
she
lingered
long
her
thoughts
sunk
deep
in
the
motionless
past
when
she
at
last
looked
up
she
saw
the
tall
strange
man
from
the
street
among
the
tombs
and
deposit
on
one
of
them
an
ungainly
lump
of
flowers
they
were
what
lin
had
been
able
hastily
to
buy
in
swampscott
he
spread
them
gently
as
he
had
noticed
the
woman
do
but
her
act
of
kneeling
he
did
not
imitate
he
went
away
quickly
for
some
hours
he
hung
about
the
little
town
aimlessly
loitering
watching
the
salt
water
where
he
used
to
swim
yu
do
belong
any
more
lin
he
miserably
said
at
length
and
took
his
way
to
boston
the
next
morning
determined
to
see
the
sights
he
was
in
new
york
and
drifted
about
to
all
places
night
and
day
till
his
money
was
mostly
gone
and
nothing
to
show
for
it
but
a
somewhat
face
and
a
deep
hatred
of
the
crowded
scrambling
east
so
he
suddenly
bought
a
ticket
for
green
river
wyoming
and
escaped
from
the
city
that
seemed
to
numb
his
good
humor
when
after
three
days
the
missouri
lay
behind
him
and
his
holiday
he
stretched
his
legs
and
took
heart
to
see
out
of
the
window
the
signs
of
approaching
desolation
and
when
on
the
fourth
day
civilization
was
utterly
emptied
out
of
the
world
he
saw
a
bunch
of
cattle
and
galloping
among
them
his
spurred
and
booted
kindred
and
his
manner
took
on
that
alertness
a
horse
shows
on
turning
into
the
home
road
as
the
stage
took
him
toward
washakie
old
friends
turned
up
every
fifty
miles
or
so
shambling
out
of
a
cabin
or
a
stable
and
saying
in
casual
tones
hello
lin
where
you
been
at
at
lander
there
got
into
the
stage
another
old
acquaintance
the
bishop
of
wyoming
he
knew
lin
at
once
and
held
out
his
hand
and
his
greeting
was
hearty
it
took
a
week
for
my
robes
to
catch
up
with
me
he
said
laughing
then
in
a
little
while
how
was
the
east
said
lin
not
looking
at
him
he
was
shy
of
the
conversation
taking
a
moral
turn
but
the
bishop
had
no
intention
of
reverting
at
any
rate
just
now
to
their
last
talk
at
green
river
and
the
advice
he
had
then
given
i
trust
your
friends
were
all
well
he
said
i
guess
they
was
healthy
enough
said
lin
i
suppose
you
found
boston
much
changed
it
a
beautiful
good
enough
town
for
them
that
likes
it
i
expect
lin
replied
the
bishop
was
forming
a
notion
of
what
the
matter
must
be
but
he
had
no
notion
whatever
of
what
now
revealed
itself
mr
bishop
the
said
how
was
that
about
that
fellow
you
told
about
that
in
the
bible
somewheres
he
come
home
to
his
folks
and
they
well
there
was
his
father
saw
him
comin
he
stopped
embarrassed
then
the
bishop
remembered
the
eyes
and
how
he
had
noticed
them
in
the
church
at
the
agency
intently
watching
him
and
just
now
what
were
best
to
say
he
did
not
know
he
looked
at
the
young
man
gravely
have
yu
got
a
bible
pursued
lin
for
excuse
me
but
i
like
to
read
that
so
the
bishop
read
and
lin
listened
and
all
the
while
this
good
clergyman
was
perplexed
how
to
speak
or
if
indeed
to
speak
at
this
time
at
all
to
the
heart
of
the
man
beside
him
for
whom
the
parable
had
gone
so
sorely
wrong
when
the
reading
was
done
lin
had
not
taken
his
eyes
from
the
bishop
face
how
long
has
that
there
been
wrote
he
asked
he
was
told
about
how
long
mr
bishop
said
lin
i
ai
got
good
knowledge
of
the
bible
and
i
never
figured
it
to
be
a
book
much
on
to
facts
and
i
tell
you
i
more
plumb
beat
about
it
having
that
elder
brother
and
him
being
angry
down
in
black
and
white
two
thousand
years
ago
than
than
if
i
seen
a
man
turn
water
into
wine
for
i
have
knowed
that
ai
so
but
the
elder
brother
is
facts
facts
and
they
knowed
about
that
and
put
it
down
just
the
same
as
life
two
thousand
years
ago
well
said
the
bishop
wisely
ignoring
the
challenge
as
to
miracles
i
am
a
good
twenty
years
older
than
you
and
all
that
time
i
been
finding
more
facts
in
the
bible
every
day
i
have
lin
meditated
i
guess
that
could
be
he
said
yes
after
that
been
and
what
i
know
for
myself
that
i
did
know
till
lately
i
guess
that
could
then
the
bishop
talked
with
exceeding
care
nor
did
he
ask
uncomfortable
things
or
moralize
visibly
thus
he
came
to
hear
how
it
had
fared
with
lin
his
friend
and
lin
forgot
altogether
about
its
being
a
parson
he
was
delivering
the
fulness
of
his
heart
to
and
come
to
think
he
concluded
it
were
home
i
had
went
to
back
east
layin
round
them
big
cities
where
a
man
ca
help
but
feel
strange
all
the
week
no
sir
yu
can
blow
in
a
thousand
dollars
like
i
did
in
new
york
and
it
not
give
yu
any
more
home
feelin
than
what
cattle
has
put
in
a
nor
it
would
have
in
boston
neither
now
this
country
here
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
endless
seein
it
onced
more
i
know
where
my
home
is
and
i
would
live
nowheres
else
only
i
ai
got
no
father
watching
for
me
to
come
up
wind
the
stated
this
merely
as
a
fact
and
without
any
note
of
but
the
bishops
face
grew
very
tender
and
he
looked
away
from
lin
knowing
his
man
for
had
he
not
seen
many
of
this
kind
in
his
desert
diocese
he
forbore
to
make
any
text
from
that
last
sentence
the
had
spoken
lin
talked
cheerfully
on
about
what
he
should
now
do
the
must
be
somewhere
near
du
noir
creek
he
would
join
it
this
season
but
next
he
should
work
over
to
the
powder
river
country
more
business
was
over
there
and
better
chances
for
a
man
to
take
up
some
land
and
have
a
ranch
of
his
own
as
they
got
out
at
fort
washakie
the
bishop
handed
him
a
small
book
in
which
he
had
turned
several
leaves
down
carefully
avoiding
any
page
that
related
of
miracles
you
need
not
read
it
through
you
know
he
said
smiling
just
read
where
i
have
marked
and
see
if
you
do
find
some
more
facts
goodbye
and
always
come
and
see
the
next
morning
he
watched
lin
riding
slowly
out
of
the
post
towards
wind
river
leading
a
single
the
little
moving
dot
went
over
the
ridge
and
as
the
bishop
walked
back
into
the
thinking
over
the
possibilities
in
that
untrained
manly
soul
he
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
the
winning
of
the
it
was
quite
clear
to
me
that
mclean
could
not
know
the
news
meeting
him
had
been
unforeseen
unforeseen
and
so
pleasant
that
the
thing
had
never
come
into
my
head
until
just
now
after
both
of
us
had
talked
and
dined
our
fill
and
were
torpid
with
satisfaction
i
had
found
lin
here
at
riverside
in
the
morning
at
my
approach
to
the
cabin
it
was
he
and
not
the
postmaster
who
had
come
precipitately
out
of
the
door
i
turruble
pleased
to
see
yu
he
had
said
immediately
what
happened
said
i
in
some
concern
at
his
appearance
and
he
piteously
explained
why
i
been
here
all
alone
since
yesterday
this
was
indeed
all
and
my
hasty
impressions
of
shooting
and
a
corpse
gave
way
to
mirth
over
the
child
and
his
innocent
grievance
that
he
had
blurted
out
before
i
could
get
off
my
horse
since
when
i
inquired
of
him
had
his
own
company
become
such
a
shock
to
him
as
to
that
replied
mclean
a
thought
ruffled
when
a
man
expects
lonesomeness
he
stands
it
like
he
stands
anything
else
of
course
but
when
he
has
figured
on
finding
company
say
he
broke
off
and
vindictiveness
sparkled
in
his
eye
when
you
lucky
enough
to
catch
yourself
alone
why
i
suppose
yu
just
take
a
chair
and
chat
to
yourself
for
you
not
seen
anything
of
tommy
he
pursued
with
interest
i
had
not
and
forthwith
lin
poured
out
to
me
the
complaints
and
sociability
with
which
he
was
bursting
the
foreman
had
sent
him
over
here
with
a
sackful
of
letters
for
the
post
and
to
bring
back
the
week
mail
for
the
ranch
a
day
was
gone
now
and
nothing
for
a
man
to
do
but
sit
and
sit
tommy
was
overdue
fifteen
hours
well
you
could
have
endured
that
but
the
neighbors
had
all
locked
their
cabins
and
gone
to
buffalo
it
was
circus
week
in
buffalo
had
i
ever
considered
the
money
there
must
be
in
the
circus
business
tommy
had
taken
the
outgoing
letters
early
yesterday
nobody
had
kept
him
waiting
by
all
rules
he
should
have
been
back
again
last
night
maybe
the
stage
was
late
reaching
powder
river
and
tommy
had
had
to
lay
over
for
it
well
that
would
justify
him
far
more
likely
he
had
gone
to
the
circus
himself
and
taken
the
mail
with
him
tommy
was
no
type
of
man
for
postmaster
except
drawing
the
allowance
his
mother
in
the
east
gave
him
first
of
every
month
he
had
never
shown
punctuality
that
lin
could
remember
never
had
any
second
thoughts
and
awful
few
first
ones
told
bigger
lies
than
a
small
man
ought
also
has
successes
though
said
i
wickedly
huh
went
on
mclean
successes
one
success
and
she
lin
still
wounded
male
pride
made
him
plaintive
why
even
that
girl
quit
him
once
she
got
the
chance
to
appreciate
how
insignificant
he
was
as
compared
with
the
size
of
his
words
no
sir
not
one
of
retains
interest
in
lin
was
unsaddling
and
looking
after
my
horse
just
because
he
was
glad
to
see
me
since
our
first
acquaintance
that
memorable
summer
of
pitchstone
canyon
when
he
had
taken
such
good
care
of
me
and
such
bad
care
of
himself
i
had
learned
pretty
well
about
horses
and
camp
craft
in
general
he
was
an
entire
boy
then
but
he
had
been
east
since
east
by
a
route
of
his
own
discovering
and
from
his
account
of
that
journey
it
had
proved
i
think
a
sort
of
spiritual
experience
and
then
the
years
of
our
friendship
were
beginning
to
roll
up
manhood
of
the
body
he
had
always
richly
possessed
and
now
whenever
we
met
after
a
season
absence
and
spoke
those
invariable
words
which
all
old
friends
upon
this
earth
use
to
each
other
at
meeting
you
have
changed
you
have
changed
at
all
i
would
wonder
if
manhood
had
arrived
in
boy
soul
and
so
while
he
attended
to
my
horse
and
explained
the
nature
of
tommy
a
subject
he
dearly
loved
just
now
i
looked
at
him
and
took
an
intimate
superior
pride
in
feeling
how
much
more
mature
i
was
than
he
after
all
there
nothing
like
a
sense
of
merit
for
making
one
feel
aggrieved
and
on
our
return
to
the
cabin
mclean
pointed
with
disgust
to
some
firewood
look
at
those
sorrowful
toothpicks
said
he
tommy
so
lin
the
excellent
hearted
had
angrily
busied
himself
and
chopped
a
pile
of
real
logs
that
would
last
a
week
he
had
also
cleaned
the
stove
and
nailed
up
the
bed
the
of
which
was
on
the
floor
it
appeared
the
master
of
the
house
had
been
sleeping
in
it
the
reverse
way
on
account
of
the
slant
thus
had
lin
cooked
and
dined
alone
supped
alone
and
sat
over
some
old
newspapers
until
alone
with
his
sense
of
virtue
and
now
here
it
was
long
after
breakfast
and
no
tommy
yet
it
good
yu
come
this
forenoon
lin
said
to
me
i
not
have
had
the
heart
to
get
up
another
dinner
just
for
myself
let
eat
rich
accordingly
we
had
richly
eaten
lin
and
i
he
had
gone
out
among
the
sheds
and
caught
some
eggs
that
is
how
he
spoke
of
it
we
had
opened
a
number
of
things
in
cans
and
i
had
made
my
famous
dish
of
evaporated
apricots
in
which
i
managed
to
fling
a
suspicion
of
caramel
throughout
the
stew
tommy
be
hot
about
these
said
lin
joyfully
as
we
ate
the
eggs
he
do
mind
what
yu
use
of
his
canned
goods
pickled
salmon
and
truck
he
is
hospitable
all
right
enough
till
it
comes
to
an
egg
then
he
tell
any
lie
but
shucks
yu
can
read
tommy
right
through
his
clothing
yourself
at
home
lin
says
he
yesterday
and
he
showed
me
his
fresh
milk
and
his
stuff
a
new
ham
says
he
bad
my
damned
hens
ai
been
layin
the
have
quit
on
me
ever
since
christmas
and
away
he
goes
to
powder
river
for
the
mail
swore
too
heavy
about
them
hens
thinks
i
well
i
expect
he
may
have
travelled
half
a
mile
by
the
time
i
found
four
i
am
fond
of
eggs
and
eat
them
constantly
and
in
wyoming
they
were
always
a
luxury
but
i
never
forget
those
that
day
and
how
lin
and
i
enjoyed
them
thinking
of
tommy
perhaps
manhood
was
not
quite
established
in
my
own
soul
at
that
time
and
perhaps
that
is
the
reason
why
it
is
the
only
time
i
have
ever
known
which
i
would
live
over
again
those
years
when
people
said
you
are
old
enough
to
know
better
and
one
did
care
salmon
apricots
eggs
we
dealt
with
them
all
properly
and
i
had
some
cigars
it
was
now
that
the
news
came
back
into
my
head
what
do
you
think
of
i
began
and
stopped
i
spoke
out
of
a
long
silence
the
slack
luxurious
silence
of
digestion
i
got
no
answer
naturally
from
the
torpid
lin
and
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
would
have
asked
me
what
i
thought
long
before
this
had
he
known
so
observing
how
comfortable
he
was
i
began
differently
what
is
the
most
important
event
that
can
happen
in
this
country
said
mclean
heard
me
where
he
lay
along
the
floor
of
the
cabin
on
his
back
dozing
by
the
fire
but
his
eyes
remained
closed
he
waggled
one
limp
open
hand
slightly
at
me
and
torpor
resumed
her
dominion
over
him
i
want
to
know
what
you
consider
the
most
important
event
that
can
happen
in
this
country
said
i
again
enunciating
each
word
with
slow
clearness
the
throat
and
lips
of
mclean
moved
and
a
sulky
sound
came
forth
that
i
recognized
to
be
meant
for
the
word
then
he
rolled
over
so
that
his
face
was
away
from
me
and
put
an
arm
over
his
eyes
i
do
mean
country
in
the
sense
of
united
states
said
i
i
mean
this
country
here
and
bear
creek
and
well
the
ranches
southward
for
fifty
miles
say
important
to
this
mosquitoes
be
due
in
about
three
weeks
said
lin
yu
might
leave
a
man
rest
till
i
want
your
opinion
said
i
oh
misery
well
a
raise
in
the
price
of
yu
said
yu
wanted
my
opinion
said
lin
seems
like
yu
merely
figure
on
givin
me
very
well
said
i
very
well
i
took
up
a
copy
of
the
cheyenne
sun
it
was
five
weeks
old
and
i
soon
perceived
that
i
had
read
it
three
weeks
ago
but
i
read
it
again
for
some
minutes
now
i
expect
a
railroad
would
be
more
important
said
mclean
persuasively
from
the
floor
than
a
rise
in
steers
said
i
occupied
with
the
cheyenne
sun
oh
yes
yes
a
railroad
certainly
it
got
to
be
money
anyhow
stated
lin
thoroughly
wakened
money
in
some
how
little
you
understand
the
real
wants
of
the
country
said
i
coming
to
the
point
it
a
mclean
lay
quite
still
on
the
floor
a
girl
i
repeated
a
new
girl
coming
to
this
starved
the
took
a
long
gradual
stretch
and
began
to
smile
well
said
he
yu
caught
me
if
that
much
to
do
when
a
man
is
with
dinner
and
he
closed
his
eyes
again
and
lay
with
a
specious
expression
of
indifference
but
that
sort
of
thing
is
a
solitary
entertainment
and
palls
starved
he
presently
muttered
we
are
kind
o
starved
that
way
i
admit
more
dollars
than
girls
to
the
square
mile
and
to
think
of
all
of
us
nice
healthy
young
bet
yu
i
know
who
she
is
he
triumphantly
cried
he
had
sat
up
and
levelled
a
finger
at
me
with
the
jerk
of
a
marksman
sidney
i
nodded
this
was
not
the
lady
name
he
could
not
recall
her
name
but
his
geography
of
her
was
accurate
one
day
in
february
my
friend
taylor
over
on
bear
creek
had
received
a
letter
no
common
event
for
her
therefore
during
several
days
she
had
all
callers
read
it
just
as
naturally
as
she
had
them
all
see
the
new
baby
and
baby
and
letter
had
both
been
brought
out
for
me
the
letter
was
signed
ever
your
afectionite
frend
katie
peck
and
was
not
easy
to
read
here
and
there
but
you
could
piece
out
the
drift
of
it
and
there
was
taylor
by
your
side
eager
to
help
you
when
you
stumbled
miss
peck
wrote
that
she
was
overworked
in
sidney
nebraska
and
needed
a
holiday
when
the
weather
grew
warm
she
should
like
to
come
to
bear
creek
and
be
like
old
times
like
to
come
and
be
like
old
times
filled
taylor
with
sentiment
and
the
with
expectation
but
it
is
a
long
way
from
february
to
warm
weather
on
bear
creek
and
even
will
forget
about
a
new
girl
if
she
does
not
come
for
several
weeks
i
had
not
heard
miss
peck
mentioned
and
old
girls
had
to
do
yesterday
however
when
i
paid
a
visit
to
miss
molly
wood
the
bear
creek
schoolmistress
i
found
her
keeping
in
order
the
cabin
and
the
children
of
the
taylors
while
they
were
gone
miles
to
the
stage
station
to
meet
their
guest
well
said
lin
judicially
miss
wood
is
a
yes
said
i
with
deep
gravity
for
i
was
thinking
of
an
occasion
when
mclean
had
discovered
that
truth
somewhat
abruptly
lin
thoughtfully
continued
she
is
she
she
what
are
you
at
oh
nothing
you
do
see
quite
so
much
of
miss
wood
as
you
used
to
do
you
huh
so
that
got
around
well
o
course
i
ought
t
knowed
better
i
suppose
all
the
same
there
lots
and
lots
of
girls
do
like
gettin
kissed
against
their
wishes
and
you
know
but
the
point
would
rather
seem
to
be
that
she
would
rather
seem
do
yu
start
that
professor
style
o
yours
or
i
i
talk
more
wickedness
in
worse
language
than
ever
yu
heard
me
do
impossible
i
murmured
sweetly
and
master
lin
went
on
as
to
point
that
do
need
to
be
explained
to
me
she
a
lady
all
he
ruminated
for
a
moment
she
has
about
scared
all
the
boys
off
though
he
continued
and
that
what
you
get
by
being
refined
he
concluded
as
if
providence
had
at
length
spoken
in
this
matter
she
has
not
scared
off
a
boy
from
virginia
i
notice
said
i
he
was
there
yesterday
afternoon
again
ridden
all
the
way
over
from
sunk
creek
did
seem
particularly
oh
well
nothin
alarms
him
not
even
refinement
said
mclean
with
his
grin
and
she
fool
your
virginian
like
she
done
the
balance
of
us
you
wait
shucks
if
all
the
girls
were
that
chilly
why
what
would
us
poor
punchers
do
you
have
me
cornered
said
i
and
we
sat
in
a
philosophical
silence
lin
on
the
floor
still
and
i
at
the
window
there
i
looked
out
upon
a
scene
my
eyes
never
tired
of
then
nor
can
my
memory
now
spring
had
passed
over
it
with
its
first
lightest
steps
the
pastured
levels
undulated
in
emerald
through
the
sage
that
just
this
moment
of
was
lilac
shone
greens
scarce
a
week
old
in
the
dimples
of
the
and
greens
beneath
today
sun
melted
among
them
around
the
doubling
of
the
creek
in
the
willow
thickets
glimmered
skeined
veils
of
yellow
and
delicate
crimson
the
stream
poured
turbulently
away
from
the
snows
of
the
mountains
behind
us
it
went
winding
in
many
folds
across
the
meadows
into
distance
and
smallness
and
so
vanished
round
the
great
red
battlement
of
wall
beyond
upon
this
were
falling
the
deep
hues
of
afternoon
violet
rose
and
saffron
swimming
and
meeting
as
if
some
prism
had
dissolved
and
flowed
over
the
turrets
and
crevices
of
the
sandstone
far
over
there
i
saw
a
dot
move
at
last
said
lin
looked
out
of
the
window
it
more
than
tommy
said
he
at
once
and
his
eyes
made
it
out
before
mine
could
it
a
wagon
tommy
horse
alongside
he
fooling
to
the
finish
lin
severely
commented
as
if
after
all
this
delay
there
should
at
least
be
a
homestretch
presently
however
a
homestretch
seemed
likely
to
occur
the
horse
executed
some
lively
manoeuvres
and
tommy
voice
reached
us
faintly
through
the
light
spring
air
he
was
evidently
howling
the
remarkable
strain
of
yells
that
the
invented
as
the
speech
best
understood
by
cows
yah
oop
but
that
gives
you
no
idea
of
it
alphabets
are
worse
than
photographs
it
is
not
the
lungs
of
every
man
that
can
produce
these
effects
nor
even
from
armies
eagles
or
mules
were
such
sounds
ever
heard
on
earth
the
invented
them
and
when
the
last
is
laid
to
rest
if
that
alas
have
not
already
befallen
the
yells
will
be
forever
gone
singularly
enough
the
cattle
appeared
to
appreciate
them
tommy
always
did
them
very
badly
and
that
was
plain
even
at
this
distance
nor
did
he
give
us
a
homestretch
after
all
the
horse
made
a
number
of
evolutions
and
returned
beside
the
wagon
showin
off
remarked
lin
tommy
showin
suspicion
crossed
his
face
and
then
certainty
why
we
might
have
knowed
that
he
exclaimed
in
dudgeon
it
he
hastened
outside
for
a
better
look
and
i
came
to
the
door
myself
that
what
it
is
said
he
the
girl
oh
yes
that
taylor
buckskin
pair
he
traded
balaam
for
she
come
by
the
stage
all
right
yesterday
yu
see
but
she
has
been
too
tired
to
travel
yu
see
or
else
maybe
taylor
wanted
to
rest
his
buckskins
they
or
else
anyway
they
laid
over
last
night
at
powder
river
and
tommy
he
has
just
laid
over
too
see
holdin
the
mail
back
on
us
hours
and
that
your
postmaster
it
was
our
postmaster
and
this
he
had
done
quite
as
the
virtuously
indignant
mclean
surmised
had
i
taken
the
same
interest
in
the
new
girl
i
suppose
that
i
too
should
have
felt
virtuously
indignant
lin
and
i
stood
outside
to
receive
the
travellers
as
their
cavalcade
drew
near
mclean
grew
silent
and
watchful
his
whole
attention
focused
upon
the
taylors
vehicle
its
approach
was
joyous
its
gear
made
a
cheerful
clanking
taylor
cracked
his
whip
and
encouragingly
chirruped
to
his
buckskins
and
tommy
apparatus
jingled
musically
for
tommy
wore
upon
himself
and
his
saddle
all
the
things
you
can
wear
in
the
wild
west
except
that
his
hair
was
not
long
our
postmaster
might
have
conducted
a
show
and
minted
gold
by
exhibiting
his
romantic
person
before
the
eyes
of
princes
he
began
with
a
rattlesnake
skin
for
a
he
continued
with
a
fringed
and
beaded
shirt
of
buckskin
and
concluded
with
large
tinkling
spurs
of
course
there
were
things
between
his
shirt
and
his
heels
but
all
leather
and
deadly
weapons
he
had
also
a
riata
a
cuerta
and
tapaderos
and
frequently
employed
these
spanish
names
for
the
objects
i
wish
that
i
had
not
lost
tommy
photograph
in
rocky
mountain
costume
you
must
understand
that
he
was
really
pretty
with
blue
eyes
ruddy
cheeks
and
a
graceful
figure
and
besides
he
had
hours
start
of
poor
dusty
lin
whose
best
clothes
were
elsewhere
you
might
have
supposed
that
it
would
be
taylor
who
should
present
us
to
her
friend
from
sidney
nebraska
but
tommy
on
his
horse
undertook
the
office
before
the
wagon
had
well
come
to
a
standstill
good
friends
of
mine
and
gentlemen
both
said
he
to
miss
peck
and
to
us
a
lady
whose
acquaintance
will
prove
a
treat
to
our
we
all
bowed
at
each
other
beneath
the
florid
expanse
of
these
recommendations
and
i
was
proceeding
to
murmur
something
about
its
being
a
long
journey
and
a
fine
day
when
miss
peck
cut
me
short
gaily
well
she
exclaimed
to
tommy
i
guess
i
pretty
near
ready
for
them
eggs
you
spoke
so
much
i
have
not
often
seen
mclean
lose
his
presence
of
mind
he
needed
merely
to
exclaim
why
tommy
you
told
me
your
hens
had
not
been
laying
since
christmas
and
we
could
have
sat
quiet
and
let
tommy
try
to
find
all
the
eggs
that
he
could
but
the
new
girl
was
a
sore
embarrassment
to
the
wits
poor
lin
stood
by
the
wheels
of
the
wagon
he
looked
up
at
miss
peck
he
looked
over
at
tommy
his
features
assumed
a
rueful
expression
and
he
wretchedly
blurted
why
tommy
i
been
and
eat
well
if
that
ai
cried
miss
peck
she
stared
with
interest
at
lin
as
he
now
assisted
her
to
descend
all
faltered
tommy
not
the
four
nests
i
had
three
meals
yu
know
lin
reminded
him
deprecatingly
i
helped
him
said
i
ten
innocent
fresh
eggs
but
we
have
left
some
ham
forgive
us
i
declare
said
miss
peck
abruptly
and
rolled
her
sluggish
inviting
eyes
upon
me
you
a
case
too
i
but
she
took
only
brief
note
of
me
although
it
was
from
head
to
foot
in
her
stare
the
dull
shine
of
familiarity
grew
vacant
and
she
turned
back
to
lin
mclean
you
carry
that
said
she
and
gave
the
pleased
a
hand
valise
i
look
after
your
things
miss
peck
called
tommy
now
springing
down
from
his
horse
the
egg
tragedy
had
momentarily
stunned
him
you
attend
to
the
mail
first
postmaster
said
the
lady
but
favoring
him
with
a
look
from
her
large
eyes
there
plenty
of
gentlemen
with
that
her
glance
favored
lin
she
went
into
the
cabin
he
following
her
close
with
the
taylors
and
myself
in
the
rear
well
i
guess
i
about
collapsed
said
she
vigorously
and
sank
upon
one
of
tommy
chairs
the
fragile
article
fell
into
sticks
beneath
her
and
lin
leaped
to
her
assistance
he
placed
her
upon
a
firmer
foundation
taylor
brought
a
basin
and
towel
to
bathe
the
dust
from
her
face
taylor
produced
whiskey
and
i
found
sugar
and
hot
water
tommy
would
doubtless
have
done
something
in
the
way
of
assistance
or
restoratives
but
he
was
gone
to
the
stable
with
the
horses
shall
i
get
your
medicine
from
the
valise
deary
inquired
taylor
not
now
her
visitor
answered
and
i
wondered
why
she
should
take
such
a
quick
look
at
me
we
soon
have
yu
independent
of
medicine
said
lin
gallantly
our
climate
and
scenery
here
has
frequently
raised
the
you
a
case
anyway
exclaimed
the
sick
lady
with
rich
conviction
the
now
sat
himself
on
the
edge
of
tommy
bed
and
throwing
one
leg
across
the
other
began
to
raise
her
spirits
with
cheerful
talk
she
steadily
watched
him
his
face
sometimes
sometimes
his
lounging
masculine
figure
while
he
thus
devoted
his
attentions
to
her
taylor
departed
to
help
tommy
at
the
stable
and
good
taylor
busy
with
supper
for
all
of
us
in
the
kitchen
expressed
her
joy
at
having
her
old
friend
of
childhood
for
a
visit
after
so
many
years
sickness
has
changed
poor
katie
some
said
she
but
i
hoping
get
back
her
looks
on
bear
she
seems
less
feeble
than
i
had
understood
i
remarked
yes
indeed
i
do
believe
she
feeling
stronger
she
was
that
tired
and
down
yesterday
with
the
long
and
it
is
so
lonesome
but
taylor
and
i
heartened
her
up
and
tommy
came
with
the
mail
and
she
real
like
feeling
she
among
how
long
will
she
stay
i
inquired
just
as
long
as
ever
she
wants
me
and
katie
has
met
since
we
was
young
girls
in
dubuque
for
i
left
home
when
i
married
taylor
and
he
brought
me
to
this
country
right
soon
and
it
ai
been
like
dubuque
much
though
if
i
had
it
to
do
over
again
i
do
just
the
same
as
taylor
knows
katie
and
me
has
wrote
even
not
till
this
february
for
you
always
mean
to
and
you
do
well
it
be
like
old
times
katie
be
most
i
expect
yes
i
was
seventeen
and
she
was
sixteen
the
very
month
i
was
married
poor
thing
she
ought
to
have
got
some
good
man
for
a
husband
but
i
expect
she
did
have
any
chance
for
there
was
a
big
o
them
girls
and
old
peck
used
to
act
real
scandalous
getting
drunk
so
folks
did
visit
there
evenings
scarcely
at
all
and
so
she
quit
home
it
seems
and
got
a
position
in
the
railroad
at
sidney
and
now
she
has
poor
health
with
feeding
them
big
trains
day
and
a
said
i
loyal
taylor
stirred
some
batter
in
silence
well
said
she
then
i
told
that
what
the
of
the
railroad
call
them
poor
you
might
hear
it
around
the
switches
at
them
division
i
had
heard
it
in
higher
places
also
but
meekly
accepted
the
reproof
if
you
have
made
your
journeys
only
since
the
new
era
of
there
is
a
quantity
of
things
you
have
come
too
late
for
and
will
never
know
three
times
a
day
in
the
brave
days
of
old
you
sprang
from
your
car
at
the
summons
of
a
gong
you
discerned
by
instinct
the
right
direction
and
passing
steadily
through
doorways
had
taken
before
you
knew
it
one
of
some
sixty
chairs
in
a
room
of
tables
and
catsup
bottles
behind
the
chairs
standing
attention
a
platoon
of
amazons
began
immediately
a
swift
chant
it
hymned
the
total
at
a
blow
in
this
inexpressible
ceremony
the
name
of
every
dish
went
hurtling
into
the
next
telescoped
to
shapelessness
moreover
if
you
stopped
your
amazon
in
the
middle
it
dislocated
her
and
she
merely
went
back
and
took
a
fresh
start
the
chant
was
always
the
same
but
you
never
learned
it
as
soon
as
it
began
your
mind
snapped
shut
like
the
upper
berth
in
a
pullman
you
must
have
uttered
appropriate
words
even
a
parrot
will
for
next
you
were
eating
things
pie
ham
hot
cakes
as
fast
as
you
could
twenty
minutes
of
swallowing
and
all
aboard
for
ogden
with
your
stomach
dumb
with
amazement
the
strasburg
goose
is
not
dieted
with
greater
velocity
and
is
a
grand
word
very
likely
some
homer
of
the
railroad
yards
first
said
it
for
what
men
upon
the
present
earth
so
speak
with
imagination
tongue
as
we
americans
if
miss
peck
had
been
a
i
could
account
readily
for
her
conversation
her
equipped
deportment
the
maturity
in
her
round
blue
marble
eye
her
abrupt
laugh
something
beyond
gay
was
now
sounding
in
response
to
mclean
lively
sallies
and
i
found
him
fanning
her
into
convalescence
with
his
hat
she
herself
made
but
few
remarks
but
allowed
the
to
entertain
her
merely
exclaiming
briefly
now
and
then
i
declare
and
if
you
ai
lin
was
most
certainly
engaging
if
that
was
the
lady
meaning
his
eyes
sparkled
upon
her
and
he
half
closed
them
now
and
then
to
look
at
her
more
effectively
i
suppose
she
was
worth
it
to
him
i
have
forgotten
to
say
that
she
was
handsome
in
a
large
style
they
made
a
pair
of
animals
but
it
was
in
the
presence
of
tommy
that
master
lin
shone
more
energetically
than
ever
and
under
such
shining
tommy
was
transparently
restless
he
tried
and
failed
to
bring
the
conversation
his
way
and
took
to
rearranging
the
mail
and
the
furniture
supper
ready
he
said
at
length
come
right
in
miss
peck
right
in
here
this
is
your
seat
this
one
please
now
you
can
see
my
fields
out
of
the
you
sit
here
said
the
to
lin
and
thus
she
was
between
them
them
elegant
she
presently
exclaimed
to
tommy
did
you
cook
i
explained
that
the
apricots
were
of
my
preparation
indeed
said
she
and
returned
to
tommy
who
had
been
telling
her
of
his
ranch
his
potatoes
his
horses
and
do
you
punch
cattle
too
she
inquired
of
him
me
said
tommy
slightingly
gave
it
up
years
ago
too
empty
a
life
for
me
i
leave
that
to
such
as
like
it
when
a
man
owns
his
own
property
tommy
swept
his
hand
at
the
whole
landscape
he
takes
to
more
intellectual
lickin
mclean
suggested
sourly
you
lick
them
and
i
cancel
them
answered
the
postmaster
and
it
does
not
seem
a
powerful
rejoinder
but
miss
peck
uttered
her
laugh
that
one
on
you
she
told
lin
and
throughout
this
meal
it
was
tommy
who
had
her
favor
she
partook
of
his
generous
supplies
she
listened
to
his
romantic
inventions
the
trails
he
had
discovered
the
bears
he
had
slain
and
after
supper
it
was
with
tommy
and
not
with
lin
that
she
went
for
a
little
walk
katie
was
ever
a
tease
said
taylor
of
her
childhood
friend
and
taylor
observed
that
there
was
always
safety
in
numbers
she
get
used
to
the
ways
of
this
country
quicker
than
our
little
said
he
mclean
said
very
little
but
read
the
papers
it
was
only
when
bedtime
dispersed
us
the
ladies
in
the
cabin
and
the
men
choosing
various
spots
outside
that
he
became
talkative
again
for
a
while
we
lay
in
the
blank
we
had
spread
on
some
soft
dry
sand
in
preference
to
the
stable
where
taylor
and
tommy
had
gone
under
the
contemplative
influence
of
the
stars
lin
fell
into
generalization
ever
notice
said
he
how
whiskey
and
lyin
act
the
same
on
a
man
i
did
not
feel
sure
that
i
had
just
the
same
way
you
keep
either
of
up
long
enough
and
yu
get
to
require
it
if
tommy
did
lie
some
every
day
he
get
i
was
sleepy
but
i
murmured
assent
to
this
and
trusted
he
would
not
go
on
ever
notice
said
he
how
the
victims
of
the
whiskey
and
lyin
habit
get
to
increasing
the
dose
yes
said
i
him
roping
six
bears
pursued
mclean
after
further
contemplation
or
any
bear
ever
notice
how
the
worser
a
man
lyin
the
silenter
other
men
get
why
that
now
i
believe
that
i
made
a
faint
sound
to
imply
that
i
was
following
him
men
do
get
took
in
but
ladies
now
they
here
he
paused
again
and
during
the
next
interval
of
contemplation
i
sank
beyond
his
reach
in
the
morning
i
left
riverside
for
buffalo
and
there
or
thereabouts
i
remained
for
a
number
of
weeks
miss
peck
did
not
enter
my
thoughts
nor
did
i
meet
any
one
to
remind
me
of
her
until
one
day
i
stopped
at
the
it
was
not
for
drugs
but
gossip
that
i
went
in
the
daytime
there
was
no
place
like
the
apothecary
for
meeting
men
and
hearing
the
news
there
i
heard
how
things
were
going
everywhere
including
bear
creek
all
the
liked
the
new
girl
up
there
said
gossip
she
was
a
great
addition
to
society
reported
to
be
more
companionable
than
the
miss
molly
wood
who
had
been
raised
too
far
east
and
showed
it
vermont
or
some
such
dude
place
several
had
been
in
town
buying
presents
for
miss
katie
peck
tommy
postmaster
had
paid
high
for
a
necklace
of
the
government
scout
at
mckinney
sold
him
too
bad
miss
peck
did
not
enjoy
good
health
shorty
had
been
in
only
yesterday
to
get
her
medicine
again
third
bottle
had
i
heard
the
big
joke
on
lin
mclean
he
had
promised
her
the
skin
of
a
big
bear
he
knew
the
location
of
and
tommy
got
the
bear
two
days
after
this
i
joined
one
of
the
roundup
camps
at
sunset
they
had
been
working
from
salt
creek
to
bear
creek
and
the
taylor
ranch
was
in
visiting
distance
from
them
again
after
an
interval
of
gathering
and
branding
far
across
the
country
the
virginian
the
southerner
whom
i
had
last
seen
lingering
with
miss
wood
was
in
camp
silent
of
the
time
as
was
his
way
he
sat
gravely
watching
lin
mclean
that
person
seemed
silent
also
as
was
not
his
way
quite
so
much
lin
said
the
southerner
i
reckon
you
mclean
raised
a
sombre
eye
but
did
not
trouble
to
answer
further
a
healthy
man
laigs
ought
to
fill
his
pants
pursued
the
virginian
the
challenged
puncher
stretched
out
a
limb
and
showed
his
muscles
with
young
pride
and
yu
take
no
comfort
in
your
food
his
ingenious
friend
continued
slowly
and
gently
i
eat
you
a
match
any
day
and
place
yu
name
said
lin
it
ai
went
on
the
virginian
to
waste
away
durin
the
a
man
owes
his
strength
to
them
that
hires
it
if
he
is
paid
to
rope
stock
he
ought
to
rope
stock
and
not
leave
it
dodge
or
pull
it
not
many
dodge
my
rope
boasted
lin
imprudently
why
they
tell
me
as
how
that
heifer
of
the
brand
got
plumb
away
from
yu
and
little
tommy
had
to
chase
afteh
lin
sat
up
angrily
amid
the
laughter
but
reclined
again
improve
said
he
if
yu
learn
me
how
yu
rope
that
vermont
stock
so
handy
has
she
promised
to
be
your
sister
yet
he
added
is
that
what
they
do
inquired
the
virginian
serenely
i
have
never
got
related
that
way
why
that
make
tommy
your
lin
and
now
indeed
the
camp
laughed
a
loud
merciless
laugh
but
lin
was
silent
where
everybody
lives
in
a
the
victory
is
to
him
who
throws
the
adroitest
stone
mclean
was
readier
witted
than
most
but
the
gentle
slow
virginian
could
be
a
master
when
he
chose
tommy
has
been
recountin
his
wars
up
at
the
taylors
he
now
told
the
camp
he
has
frequently
campaigned
with
general
crook
general
miles
and
general
ruger
all
at
onced
he
an
exciting
fighter
in
conversation
and
kep
us
all
scared
for
mighty
nigh
an
hour
miss
peck
appeared
interested
in
his
what
was
you
doing
at
the
taylors
yourself
demanded
lin
visitin
miss
wood
answered
the
virginian
with
entire
ease
for
he
also
knew
when
to
employ
the
plain
truth
as
a
bluff
you
ought
to
write
to
tommy
mother
lin
and
tell
her
what
a
her
son
is
gettin
to
be
she
would
cut
off
his
allowance
and
bring
him
home
and
you
would
have
the
runnin
all
to
i
fix
him
yet
muttered
mclean
him
and
his
with
that
he
rose
and
left
us
the
next
afternoon
he
informed
me
that
if
i
was
riding
up
the
creek
to
spend
the
night
he
would
go
for
company
in
that
direction
we
started
therefore
without
any
mention
of
the
taylors
or
miss
peck
i
was
puzzled
never
had
i
seen
him
thus
disconcerted
by
woman
with
him
woman
had
been
a
transient
disturbance
i
had
witnessed
a
series
of
flighty
romances
where
the
had
come
seen
often
conquered
and
moved
on
nor
had
his
affairs
been
of
the
sort
to
teach
a
young
man
respect
i
am
putting
it
rather
mildly
for
the
first
part
of
our
way
this
afternoon
he
was
moody
and
after
that
began
to
speak
with
appalling
wisdom
about
life
life
he
said
was
a
serious
matter
did
i
realize
that
a
man
was
liable
to
forget
it
a
man
was
liable
to
go
sporting
and
helling
around
till
he
waked
up
some
day
and
found
all
his
best
pleasures
had
become
just
a
business
no
interest
no
surprise
no
novelty
left
and
no
cash
in
the
bank
shorty
owed
him
fifty
dollars
shorty
would
be
able
to
pay
that
after
the
and
he
lin
would
get
his
time
and
rustle
altogether
some
five
hundred
dollars
then
there
was
his
homestead
claim
on
box
elder
and
the
surveyors
were
coming
in
this
fall
no
better
location
for
a
home
in
this
country
than
box
elder
wood
water
fine
land
all
it
needed
was
a
house
and
ditches
and
buildings
and
fences
and
to
be
planted
with
crops
such
chances
and
considerations
should
sober
a
man
and
make
him
careful
what
he
did
i
take
in
cheyenne
on
our
and
after
that
i
settle
right
down
to
improving
box
elder
concluded
mclean
suddenly
his
real
intentions
flashed
upon
me
for
the
first
time
i
had
not
remotely
imagined
such
a
step
marry
her
i
screeched
in
dismay
marry
her
i
do
know
which
word
was
the
worse
to
emphasize
at
such
a
moment
but
i
emphasized
both
thoroughly
i
did
expect
yu
act
that
way
said
the
lover
he
dropped
behind
me
fifty
yards
and
spoke
no
more
not
at
once
did
i
beg
his
pardon
for
the
brutality
i
had
been
surprised
into
it
is
one
of
those
speeches
that
once
said
is
said
forever
but
it
was
not
that
which
withheld
me
as
i
thought
of
the
tone
in
which
my
friend
had
replied
it
seemed
to
me
sullen
rather
than
deeply
angry
or
wounded
resentment
at
my
opinion
not
of
her
character
so
much
as
of
his
choice
then
i
began
to
be
sorry
for
the
fool
and
schemed
for
a
while
how
to
intervene
but
have
you
ever
tried
intervention
i
soon
abandoned
the
idea
and
took
a
way
to
be
forgiven
and
to
learn
more
lin
i
began
slowing
my
horse
you
must
not
think
about
what
i
i
thinkin
of
pleasanter
subjects
said
he
and
slowed
his
own
horse
oh
look
here
i
exclaimed
well
said
he
he
allowed
his
horse
to
come
within
about
ten
yards
astonishment
makes
a
man
say
anything
i
proceeded
and
i
say
again
you
too
good
for
her
and
i
say
i
do
generally
believe
in
the
wife
being
older
than
the
what
two
years
said
lin
i
was
near
screeching
out
again
but
saved
myself
he
was
not
quite
and
i
remembered
taylor
unprejudiced
computation
of
the
years
it
is
a
lady
prerogative
however
to
estimate
her
own
age
she
had
her
birthday
last
month
said
lin
with
sentiment
bringing
his
horse
entirely
abreast
of
mine
i
promised
her
a
yes
said
i
i
heard
about
that
in
lin
face
grew
dusky
with
anger
no
doubt
yu
heard
about
it
said
he
i
do
guess
yu
heard
much
about
anything
else
i
ai
told
the
truth
to
any
of
but
he
looked
at
me
with
a
certain
hesitation
i
think
i
will
he
continued
i
do
mind
tellin
he
began
to
speak
in
a
strictly
business
tone
while
he
evened
the
coils
of
rope
that
hung
on
his
saddle
she
had
spoke
to
me
about
her
birthday
and
i
had
spoke
to
her
about
something
to
give
her
i
had
offered
to
buy
her
in
town
whatever
she
named
and
i
was
figuring
to
borrow
from
taylor
but
she
fancied
the
notion
of
a
i
had
mentioned
about
some
cubs
i
had
found
the
cubs
where
the
had
them
cached
by
the
foot
of
a
big
boulder
in
the
range
over
ten
sleep
and
i
put
back
the
leaves
and
stuff
on
top
them
little
things
as
near
as
i
could
the
way
i
found
them
so
that
the
bear
would
not
suspicion
me
for
i
was
aiming
to
get
her
and
miss
peck
she
sure
wanted
the
hide
for
her
birthday
so
i
went
back
the
was
off
and
i
crumb
up
inside
the
rock
and
i
waited
a
turruble
long
spell
till
the
sun
travelled
clean
around
the
canyon
bear
come
home
though
a
big
cinnamon
and
i
raised
my
gun
but
laid
it
down
to
see
what
she
do
she
scrapes
around
and
snuffs
and
the
cubs
start
whining
and
she
talks
back
to
next
she
sits
up
awful
big
and
lifts
up
a
cub
and
holds
it
to
her
close
with
both
her
paws
same
as
a
person
and
she
rubbed
her
ear
agin
the
cub
and
the
cub
sort
o
nipped
her
and
she
cuffed
the
cub
and
the
other
cub
came
toddlin
and
away
they
starts
rolling
all
three
of
i
watched
that
for
a
long
while
that
big
thing
just
nursed
and
played
with
them
little
cubs
beatin
em
for
a
change
onced
in
a
while
and
talkin
and
onced
in
a
while
sit
up
solemn
and
look
all
around
so
that
i
near
busted
why
how
was
i
goin
to
spoil
that
so
i
come
away
very
quiet
you
bet
for
i
have
hated
to
have
bear
notice
me
miss
peck
she
laughed
she
claimed
i
was
scared
to
after
you
had
told
her
why
it
was
said
i
before
and
after
i
did
tell
her
first
because
i
felt
kind
of
foolish
then
tommy
went
and
he
killed
the
bear
all
right
and
she
has
the
skin
now
of
course
the
boys
joshed
me
a
heap
about
gettin
beat
by
but
since
she
has
taken
you
said
i
she
ai
said
it
but
she
will
when
she
understands
i
fancied
that
the
lady
understood
the
once
i
had
seen
her
she
appeared
to
me
as
what
might
be
termed
an
expert
in
men
and
one
to
understand
also
the
reality
of
tommy
ranch
and
allowance
and
how
greatly
these
differed
from
box
elder
probably
the
one
thing
she
could
not
understand
was
why
lin
spared
the
mother
and
her
cubs
a
deserted
home
in
dubuque
a
career
in
a
railroad
a
somewhat
vague
past
and
a
present
lacking
context
indeed
i
hoped
with
all
my
heart
that
tommy
would
win
lin
said
i
i
backing
back
away
said
he
tommy
can
please
a
woman
him
and
his
blue
eyes
but
he
do
savvy
how
to
make
a
woman
want
him
not
any
better
than
he
knows
about
killin
did
you
hear
about
the
crows
said
i
about
young
bucks
going
on
the
shucks
that
put
up
by
the
papers
of
this
section
they
aimin
to
get
uncle
sam
to
order
his
troops
out
and
then
folks
can
sell
hay
and
stuff
to
if
tommy
believed
any
crows
he
stopped
and
suddenly
slapped
his
leg
what
the
matter
now
i
asked
oh
he
took
to
singing
and
his
face
grew
roguish
to
its
full
extent
what
made
yu
say
that
to
me
he
asked
presently
say
what
about
marrying
yu
do
think
i
i
onced
in
a
while
yu
tell
me
i
flighty
well
i
am
colts
ought
not
to
marry
said
i
sure
said
he
and
it
was
not
until
we
came
in
sight
of
the
virginian
black
horse
tied
in
front
of
miss
wood
cabin
next
the
taylors
that
lin
changed
the
lively
course
of
thought
that
was
evidently
filling
his
mind
tell
yu
said
he
touching
my
arm
confidentially
and
pointing
to
the
black
horse
for
all
her
vermont
refinement
she
a
woman
just
the
same
she
likes
him
dangling
round
her
so
earnest
him
that
no
body
ever
saw
dangle
before
and
he
has
quit
spreein
with
the
boys
and
what
does
he
get
by
it
i
am
glad
i
was
not
raised
good
enough
to
appreciate
the
miss
woods
of
this
world
he
added
defiantly
except
at
long
at
the
taylors
cabin
we
found
miss
wood
sitting
with
her
admirer
and
tommy
from
riverside
come
to
admire
miss
peck
the
might
pass
for
certainly
something
had
agreed
with
her
whether
the
medicine
or
the
mountain
air
or
so
much
masculine
company
whatever
had
done
it
she
had
bloomed
into
brutal
comeliness
her
hair
looked
curlier
her
figure
was
shapelier
her
teeth
shone
whiter
and
her
cheeks
were
a
lusty
overbearing
red
and
there
sat
molly
wood
talking
sweetly
to
her
big
grave
virginian
to
look
at
them
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
had
been
raised
good
enough
to
appreciate
her
no
matter
what
had
been
his
raising
lin
greeted
every
one
jauntily
how
are
yu
miss
peck
how
are
yu
tommy
said
he
hear
the
news
tommy
crow
injuns
on
the
i
declare
said
the
the
virginian
was
about
to
say
something
but
his
eye
met
lin
and
then
he
looked
at
tommy
then
what
he
did
say
was
i
had
been
to
mention
it
to
the
ladies
until
it
was
right
you
need
to
be
afraid
miss
peck
said
tommy
there
lots
of
men
who
afraid
said
the
oh
said
lin
maybe
it
like
most
news
we
get
in
this
country
two
weeks
stale
and
a
lie
when
it
was
of
course
said
tommy
hello
tommy
called
taylor
from
the
lane
your
horse
has
broke
his
rein
and
run
down
the
tommy
rose
in
disgust
and
sped
after
the
animal
i
must
be
cooking
supper
now
said
katie
shortly
i
stir
for
yu
said
lin
grinning
at
her
come
along
then
said
she
and
they
departed
to
the
adjacent
kitchen
miss
wood
gray
eyes
brightened
with
mischief
she
looked
at
her
virginian
and
she
looked
at
me
do
you
know
she
said
i
used
to
be
so
afraid
that
when
bear
creek
was
new
any
more
it
might
become
dull
miss
peck
does
find
it
dull
either
said
molly
wood
immediately
assumed
a
look
of
doubt
but
might
it
become
just
just
a
little
trying
to
have
two
gentlemen
so
very
determined
you
know
only
one
is
determined
said
the
virginian
molly
looked
inquiring
lin
is
determined
tommy
shall
not
beat
him
that
all
it
amounts
dear
me
what
a
notion
no
no
notion
tommy
well
tommy
is
considered
harmless
a
of
reputation
in
this
country
would
never
let
tommy
get
ahaid
of
him
that
it
pleasant
to
know
sometimes
how
much
we
count
exclaimed
molly
why
said
the
virginian
surprised
at
her
flash
of
indignation
where
is
any
countin
without
some
love
do
you
mean
to
say
that
mclean
does
not
care
for
miss
peck
i
reckon
he
thinks
he
does
but
there
is
a
mighty
wide
difference
between
thinkin
and
feelin
i
saw
molly
eyes
drop
from
his
and
i
saw
the
rose
deepen
in
her
cheeks
but
just
then
a
loud
voice
came
from
the
kitchen
you
lin
if
you
try
any
of
your
foolin
with
me
i
histe
yu
over
the
jiste
all
i
attempted
to
resume
quit
now
lin
mclean
shouted
the
voice
or
i
put
yus
through
that
window
and
it
well
miss
peck
i
gettin
most
a
full
dose
o
this
treatment
ever
since
yu
come
i
been
doing
my
best
and
yu
just
cough
in
my
face
and
now
i
going
to
quit
and
cough
would
you
enjoy
walkin
out
till
supper
inquired
the
virginian
as
molly
rose
you
was
speaking
of
gathering
some
flowers
why
yes
said
molly
blithely
and
you
come
she
added
to
me
but
i
was
on
the
virginian
side
i
must
look
after
my
horse
said
i
and
went
down
to
the
corral
day
was
slowly
going
as
i
took
my
pony
to
the
water
corncliff
mesa
crowheart
butte
these
shone
in
the
rays
that
came
through
the
canyon
the
canyon
sides
lifted
like
tawny
castles
in
the
same
light
where
i
walked
the
odor
of
thousands
of
wild
roses
hung
over
the
margin
where
the
thickets
grew
high
in
the
upper
air
magpies
were
sailing
across
the
silent
blue
somewhere
i
could
hear
tommy
explaining
loudly
how
he
and
general
crook
had
pumped
lead
into
hundreds
of
indians
and
when
brought
us
all
back
to
the
door
he
was
finishing
the
account
to
taylor
molly
and
the
virginian
arrived
bearing
flowers
and
he
was
saying
that
few
had
any
reason
for
saving
their
money
but
when
you
get
old
said
she
we
mostly
do
live
long
enough
to
get
old
said
he
simply
but
i
have
a
reason
and
i
am
give
me
the
flowers
said
molly
and
she
left
him
to
arrange
them
on
the
table
as
lin
came
hurrying
out
i
told
her
said
he
to
the
southerner
and
me
that
i
asked
her
twiced
and
i
going
to
let
her
have
one
more
chance
and
i
told
her
that
if
it
a
log
cabin
she
marryin
why
tommy
is
a
sure
good
wooden
piece
of
furniture
to
put
inside
it
and
i
guess
she
knows
there
not
much
wooden
furniture
about
me
i
want
to
speak
to
he
took
the
virginian
round
the
corner
but
though
he
would
not
confide
in
me
i
began
to
discern
something
quite
definite
at
supper
cattle
men
will
lose
stock
if
the
crows
get
down
as
far
as
this
he
said
casually
and
taylor
suppressed
a
titter
ai
it
hawses
the
repawted
as
running
off
said
the
virginian
chap
come
into
the
this
afternoon
said
lin
but
he
was
rattled
and
told
a
heap
o
facts
that
would
of
course
they
would
said
tommy
haughtily
oh
there
nothing
in
it
said
lin
dismissing
the
subject
have
yu
been
to
the
opera
since
we
went
to
cheyenne
taylor
taylor
had
not
lin
said
the
virginian
did
yu
ever
see
that
opera
cyarmen
you
bet
fellow
girl
quits
him
for
a
bullfighter
gets
him
up
in
the
mountains
and
quits
him
he
was
much
good
not
in
her
class
sports
smugglin
and
i
reckon
she
was
doubtful
of
him
from
the
start
took
him
to
the
to
experiment
where
they
not
have
interruption
said
the
virginian
talking
of
mountains
said
tommy
this
range
here
used
to
be
a
great
place
for
indians
till
we
ran
out
with
terry
pumped
lead
into
the
red
you
bet
said
lin
do
yu
figure
that
girl
tired
of
her
and
quit
him
too
i
reckon
replied
the
virginian
that
the
wore
fans
and
taverns
and
gypsies
and
sportin
said
lin
my
but
i
like
to
see
them
countries
with
oranges
and
only
i
expect
spain
maybe
ai
keepin
it
up
so
gay
as
when
the
soon
left
romance
and
turned
upon
steers
and
alfalfa
a
grass
but
lately
introduced
in
the
country
no
further
mention
was
made
of
the
hostile
crows
and
from
this
i
drew
the
false
conclusion
that
tommy
had
not
come
up
to
their
hopes
in
the
matter
of
reciting
his
campaigns
but
when
the
hour
came
for
those
visitors
who
were
not
spending
the
night
to
take
their
leave
taylor
drew
tommy
aside
with
me
and
i
noticed
the
virginian
speaking
with
molly
wood
whose
face
showed
diversion
do
seem
to
make
anything
of
it
whispered
taylor
to
tommy
but
the
ladies
have
got
their
minds
on
this
indian
why
i
just
explain
began
tommy
do
whispered
lin
joining
us
yu
know
how
women
are
once
they
take
a
notion
why
the
more
yu
deny
the
surer
they
get
now
yu
see
him
and
me
he
jerked
his
elbow
towards
the
virginian
must
go
back
to
camp
for
we
on
second
and
the
ladies
would
sleep
better
knowing
there
was
another
man
in
the
house
said
taylor
in
that
case
said
tommy
i
yu
see
said
lin
they
been
told
about
ten
sleep
being
burned
two
nights
it
ai
cried
tommy
why
of
course
it
ai
drawled
the
ingenious
lin
but
that
what
i
say
you
and
i
know
ten
sleep
all
right
but
we
ca
report
from
our
own
knowledge
seeing
it
all
right
and
there
it
is
they
get
these
nervous
just
do
appear
to
make
anything
special
of
not
going
back
to
riverside
repeated
taylor
but
but
just
kind
of
stay
here
said
lin
i
will
exclaimed
tommy
of
course
i
glad
to
i
suppose
i
was
all
this
pains
seemed
to
me
larger
than
its
results
they
had
imposed
upon
tommy
yes
but
what
of
that
he
was
to
be
kept
from
going
back
to
riverside
until
morning
unless
they
proposed
to
visit
his
empty
cabin
and
play
tricks
but
that
would
be
too
childish
even
for
lin
mclean
to
say
nothing
of
the
virginian
his
occasional
partner
in
mischief
in
spite
of
the
crows
i
satirically
told
the
ladies
i
shall
sleep
outside
as
i
intended
i
no
use
for
houses
at
this
the
cinches
of
the
horses
were
tightened
lin
and
the
virginian
laid
a
hand
on
their
swung
up
and
soon
all
sound
of
the
galloping
horses
had
ceased
molly
wood
declined
to
be
nervous
and
crossed
to
her
little
neighbor
cabin
we
all
parted
and
as
always
in
that
blessed
country
deep
sleep
quickly
came
to
me
i
do
know
how
long
after
it
was
that
i
sprang
from
my
blankets
in
fright
but
i
had
dreamed
nothing
a
second
long
wild
yell
now
gave
me
i
must
own
to
it
a
horrible
chill
i
had
no
pistol
nothing
in
the
hateful
brightness
of
the
moon
my
single
thought
was
house
house
and
i
fled
across
the
lane
in
my
underclothes
to
the
cabin
when
round
the
corner
whirled
the
two
and
i
understood
i
saw
the
virginian
catch
sight
of
me
in
my
shirt
and
saw
his
teeth
as
he
smiled
i
hastened
to
my
blankets
and
returned
more
decent
to
stand
and
watch
the
two
go
shooting
and
yelling
round
the
cabin
crazy
with
their
youth
the
door
was
opened
and
taylor
courageously
emerged
bearing
a
winchester
he
fired
at
the
sky
immediately
b
gosh
he
roared
that
he
fired
again
out
and
at
they
at
this
duly
came
taylor
in
white
with
a
pistol
and
miss
peck
in
white
staring
and
stolid
but
no
tommy
noise
prevailed
without
shots
by
the
stable
and
shots
by
the
creek
the
two
dismounted
and
joined
taylor
maniac
delight
seized
me
and
i
too
rushed
about
with
them
helping
the
din
oh
taylor
said
a
voice
i
did
think
it
of
it
was
molly
wood
come
from
her
cabin
very
pretty
in
a
arrangement
she
stood
by
the
fence
laughing
but
more
at
us
than
with
us
stop
friends
said
taylor
gasping
she
teaches
my
bobbie
his
a
b
i
hate
to
have
bobbie
speak
to
your
papa
said
molly
and
held
her
scholar
up
on
the
fence
well
i
be
said
taylor
surveying
his
costume
if
lin
mclean
has
made
a
fool
of
me
where
has
tommy
got
said
taylor
did
yus
see
him
said
the
speaking
her
first
word
in
all
this
we
followed
her
into
the
kitchen
the
table
was
covered
with
tin
plates
beneath
it
wedged
knelt
tommy
with
a
pistol
firm
in
his
hand
but
the
plates
were
rattling
up
and
down
like
castanets
there
was
a
silence
among
us
and
i
wondered
what
we
were
going
to
do
well
murmured
the
virginian
to
himself
if
i
could
have
foresaw
not
it
makes
yu
feel
humiliated
he
marched
out
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
away
lin
followed
him
but
perhaps
less
penitently
we
all
dispersed
without
saying
anything
and
presently
from
my
blankets
i
saw
poor
tommy
come
out
of
the
silent
cabin
mount
and
slowly
very
slowly
ride
away
he
would
spend
the
night
at
riverside
after
all
of
course
we
recovered
from
our
unexpected
shame
and
the
tale
of
the
table
and
the
dancing
plates
was
not
told
as
a
sad
one
but
it
is
a
sad
one
when
you
think
of
it
i
was
not
there
to
see
lin
get
his
bride
i
learned
from
the
virginian
how
the
victorious
puncher
had
ridden
away
across
the
sunny
sagebrush
bearing
the
with
him
to
the
nearest
justice
of
the
peace
she
was
astride
the
horse
he
had
brought
for
her
yes
he
beat
tommy
said
the
virginian
some
folks
anyway
get
what
they
want
in
this
hyeh
from
which
i
inferred
that
miss
molly
wood
was
harder
to
beat
than
tommy
lin
mclean
rain
had
not
fallen
for
some
sixty
days
and
for
some
sixty
more
there
was
no
necessity
that
it
should
fall
it
is
spells
of
weather
like
this
that
set
the
western
editor
writing
praise
and
prophecy
of
the
boundless
fertility
of
the
soil
when
irrigated
and
of
what
an
eden
it
can
be
made
with
irrigation
but
the
spells
annoy
the
people
who
are
trying
to
raise
the
eden
we
always
told
the
transient
eastern
visitor
when
he
arrived
at
cheyenne
and
criticised
the
desert
that
anything
would
grow
here
with
irrigation
and
sometimes
he
replied
unsympathetically
that
anything
could
fly
with
wings
then
we
would
lead
such
a
man
out
and
show
him
six
eight
ten
square
miles
of
green
crops
and
he
if
he
was
thoroughly
nasty
would
mention
that
wyoming
contained
thousand
square
miles
all
waiting
for
irrigation
and
eden
one
of
these
eastern
supercivilized
hostiles
from
new
york
was
breakfasting
with
the
governor
and
me
at
the
cheyenne
club
and
we
were
explaining
to
him
the
glorious
future
the
coming
empire
of
the
western
country
now
the
governor
was
about
and
until
had
never
gone
west
far
enough
to
see
over
the
top
of
the
alleghany
mountains
i
was
not
a
pioneer
myself
and
why
both
of
us
should
have
pitied
the
narrowness
so
hard
i
can
not
see
but
we
did
we
spoke
to
him
of
the
size
of
the
country
we
told
him
that
his
state
could
rattle
round
inside
wyoming
stomach
without
any
inconvenience
to
wyoming
and
he
told
us
that
this
was
because
wyoming
stomach
was
empty
altogether
i
began
to
feel
almost
sorry
that
i
had
asked
him
to
come
out
for
a
hunt
and
had
travelled
in
haste
all
the
way
from
bear
creek
to
cheyenne
expressly
to
meet
him
for
purposes
of
amusement
he
said
i
admit
anything
you
claim
for
this
place
ranches
cowboys
elk
it
all
splendid
only
as
an
investment
i
prefer
the
east
am
i
to
see
any
cowboys
you
shall
i
said
and
i
distinctly
hoped
some
of
them
might
do
something
to
him
for
purposes
of
you
fellows
come
up
with
me
to
my
office
said
the
governor
look
at
my
mail
and
show
you
so
we
went
with
him
through
the
heat
and
sun
what
that
inquired
the
whom
i
shall
call
james
ogden
that
is
our
park
said
i
of
course
it
merely
in
embryo
wonderful
how
quickly
any
shade
tree
will
grow
here
wi
i
checked
myself
but
ogden
said
with
irrigation
for
me
and
i
was
entirely
sorry
he
had
come
we
reached
the
governor
office
and
sat
down
while
he
looked
his
letters
over
here
you
are
ogden
said
he
here
the
way
we
hump
ahead
out
and
he
read
us
the
following
magaw
kansas
july
hon
amory
baker
sir
understanding
that
your
district
is
suffering
from
a
prolonged
drought
i
write
to
say

necessary
expenses
paid

will
be
glad
to
furnish
you

a
reasonably
shower
i
have
operated
successfully
in
australia
mexico
and
several
states
of
the
union
and
am
anxious
to
exhibit
my
system
if
your
legislature
will
appropriate
a
sum
to
cover
as
i
said
merely
my
necessary
expenses
say
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
half
an
inch
i
will
guarantee
you
that
quantity
of
rain
or
forfeit

to
be
no

kindly
advise
me
of
what

inquired
ogden
in
good
faith
the
governor
laughed
boisterously

would
be
constitutional
said
he
oh
bother
said
ogden
my
dear
man
the
governor
protested
i
know
we
new
and
our
women
vote
and
we
a
good
deal
of
a
joke
but
we
not
so
progressively
funny
as
all
that
the
people
would
stand
it
senator
warren
would
fly
right
into
my
back
barker
was
also
new
as
governor
do
you
have
senators
here
too
said
ogden
raising
his
eyebrows
what
do
they
look
like
are
they
females
and
the
governor
grew
more
boisterous
than
ever
slapping
his
knee
and
declaring
that
these
eastern
men
were
certainly
out
of
sight
ogden
however
was
thoughtful
i
have
been
willing
to
chip
in
for
that
rain
myself
he
said
that
an
idea
cried
the
governor
nothing
unconstitutional
about
that
let
see
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
i
put
up
a
hundred
said
ogden
promptly
i
out
for
a
western
vacation
and
i
pay
for
a
good
the
governor
and
i
subscribed
more
modestly
and
by
noon
with
the
help
of
some
lively
minded
gentlemen
of
cheyenne
we
had
the
purse
raised
he
wo
care
said
the
governor
whether
it
a
private
enterprise
or
a
municipal
step
so
long
as
he
gets
his
he
wo
get
it
i
afraid
said
ogden
but
if
he
succeeds
in
tempting
providence
to
that
extent
i
consider
it
cheap
now
what
do
you
call
those
people
there
on
the
horses
we
were
walking
along
the
track
of
the
cheyenne
and
northern
and
looking
out
over
the
plain
toward
fort
russell
that
is
a
and
his
bride
i
answered
recognizing
the
couple
real
quite
the
puncher
name
is
lin
real
bride
i
afraid
she
riding
straddle
exclaimed
the
delighted
ogden
adjusting
his
glasses
why
do
you
object
to
their
union
being
holy
i
explained
that
my
friend
lin
had
lately
married
an
lady
precipitately
and
against
my
advice
i
suppose
he
knew
his
business
observed
ogden
that
what
he
said
to
me
at
the
time
but
you
ought
to
see
her
and
know
ogden
was
going
to
husband
and
wife
were
coming
our
way
husband
nodded
to
me
his
familiar
offish
nod
which
concealed
his
satisfaction
at
meeting
with
an
old
friend
wife
did
not
look
at
me
at
all
but
i
looked
at
her
and
i
instantly
knew
that
lin
the
fool
had
confided
to
her
my
disapproval
of
their
marriage
the
most
delicate
specialty
upon
earth
is
your
standing
with
your
old
friend
new
wife
mclean
said
the
governor
to
the
on
his
horse
how
are
yu
doctor
said
lin
during
his
early
days
in
wyoming
the
governor
when
as
yet
a
private
citizen
had
set
mclean
broken
leg
at
drybone
let
me
make
yu
known
to
mclean
pursued
the
husband
the
lady
at
a
loss
how
convention
prescribes
the
greeting
of
a
bride
to
a
governor
gave
a
waddle
on
the
pony
back
then
sat
up
stiff
gazed
haughtily
at
the
air
and
did
not
speak
or
show
any
more
sign
than
a
cow
would
under
like
circumstances
so
the
governor
marched
cheerfully
at
her
extending
his
hand
and
when
she
slightly
moved
out
toward
him
her
big
dumb
red
fist
he
took
it
and
shook
it
and
made
her
a
series
of
compliments
she
maintaining
always
the
scrupulous
reserve
of
the
cow
i
say
ogden
whispered
to
me
while
barker
was
pumping
the
hand
of
the
flesh
image
i
glad
i
the
appearance
of
the
also
interested
ogden
and
he
looked
hard
at
lin
leather
chaps
and
and
so
forth
lin
stared
at
the
and
his
high
white
collar
and
good
scarf
he
had
seen
such
things
quite
often
of
course
but
they
always
filled
him
with
the
same
distrust
of
the
man
that
wore
them
well
said
he
i
guess
we
be
pulling
for
a
hotel
any
show
in
town
circus
come
yet
no
said
i
are
you
going
to
make
a
long
stay
the
glanced
at
the
image
his
bride
of
three
weeks
till
we
tired
of
it
i
guess
said
he
with
hesitation
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
seen
my
gay
friend
look
timidly
at
any
one
and
i
felt
a
rising
hate
for
the
lady
the
whose
influence
was
dimming
this
jaunty
irrepressible
spirit
i
looked
at
her
her
bulky
bloom
had
ensnared
him
and
now
she
was
going
to
tame
and
spoil
him
the
governor
was
looking
at
her
too
thoughtfully
say
lin
i
said
if
you
stay
here
long
enough
you
see
a
big
and
his
eye
livened
into
something
of
its
native
jocularity
as
i
told
him
of
the
shucks
said
he
springing
from
his
horse
impetuously
and
hugely
entertained
at
our
venture
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
let
me
come
in
and
before
i
could
tell
him
that
we
had
all
the
money
raised
he
was
hauling
out
a
wadded
lump
of
bills
well
i
ai
going
to
starve
here
in
the
road
i
guess
spoke
the
image
with
the
suddenness
of
a
miracle
i
think
we
all
jumped
and
i
know
that
lin
did
the
image
continued
some
folks
and
their
money
are
soon
parted
she
meant
me
her
searching
tones
came
straight
at
me
i
was
sure
from
the
first
that
she
knew
all
about
me
and
my
unfavorable
opinion
of
her
but
it
ai
going
to
be
you
this
time
lin
mclean
ged
ap
this
last
was
to
the
horse
i
maintain
though
the
governor
says
the
husband
immediately
started
off
on
a
run
at
any
rate
they
were
gone
to
their
hotel
and
ogden
was
seated
on
some
railroad
ties
exclaiming
oh
i
like
wyoming
i
am
certainly
glad
i
that
who
she
is
said
the
governor
remembering
mclean
all
at
once
i
know
her
she
used
to
be
at
sidney
she
got
another
husband
somewhere
she
one
of
the
boys
oh
that
nothing
in
this
country
he
continued
to
the
amazed
ogden
who
had
ejaculated
bigamy
lots
of
them
marry
live
together
awhile
get
tired
and
quit
travel
catch
on
to
a
new
man
marry
him
get
tired
and
quit
travel
catch
on
one
moment
i
beg
said
ogden
adjusting
his
glasses
what
does
the
law
law
said
the
governor
look
at
that
place
he
swept
his
hand
towards
the
vast
plains
and
the
mountains
thousand
square
miles
of
that
and
sixty
thousand
people
in
it
we
have
got
policemen
yet
on
top
of
the
rocky
i
see
said
the
but
but
well
let
a
and
b
represent
first
and
second
husbands
and
x
represent
the
woman
now
does
a
know
about
b
or
does
b
know
about
a
and
what
do
they
do
about
it
ca
say
the
governor
answered
jovially
ca
generalize
depends
on
heaps
of
things
love
money
did
you
go
to
college
well
let
a
minus
x
equal
b
plus
x
then
if
a
and
b
get
squared
oh
come
to
lunch
i
said
barker
do
you
really
know
the
first
husband
is
alive
was
dead
last
and
barker
gave
us
the
particulars
miss
katie
peck
had
not
served
long
in
the
restaurant
before
she
was
wooed
and
won
by
a
man
who
had
been
a
ranch
cook
a
a
a
freight
hand
and
was
then
hauling
poles
for
the
government
during
his
necessary
absences
from
home
she
too
went
this
he
often
discovered
and
would
beat
her
and
she
would
then
also
beat
him
after
the
beatings
one
of
them
would
always
leave
the
other
forever
thus
was
sidney
kept
in
until
lusk
one
day
really
did
not
come
back
lusk
said
the
governor
finishing
his
story
cried
around
the
saloons
for
a
couple
of
days
and
then
went
on
hauling
poles
for
the
government
till
at
last
he
said
he
heard
of
a
better
job
south
and
next
we
knew
of
him
he
was
round
leavenworth
lusk
was
a
pretty
poor
bird
owes
me
ten
well
i
said
none
of
us
ever
knew
about
him
when
she
came
to
stay
with
taylor
on
bear
creek
she
was
miss
peck
when
lin
made
her
you
notice
said
the
governor
how
she
has
got
him
under
in
three
weeks
old
hand
you
poor
lin
i
said
lucky
i
call
him
said
the
governor
he
can
quit
supposing
mclean
does
not
want
to
quit
her
she
educating
him
to
want
to
right
now
and
i
think
he
learn
pretty
quick
i
guess
lin
romance
was
very
ideal
this
trip
hello
here
comes
jode
jode
wo
you
lunch
with
us
ogden
of
new
york
jode
jode
is
our
officer
the
governor
eyes
were
sparkling
hilariously
and
he
winked
at
me
gentlemen
ogden
i
am
honored
to
make
your
acquaintance
said
the
officer
jode
when
is
it
going
to
rain
said
the
governor
anxiously
now
jode
is
the
most
extraordinarily
solemn
man
i
have
ever
known
he
has
the
solemnity
of
all
science
added
to
the
unspeakable
weight
of
representing
five
of
the
oldest
families
in
south
carolina
the
jodes
themselves
were
not
old
in
south
carolina
but
immensely
so
in
i
think
he
told
me
it
was
long
island
his
name
is
poinsett
middleton
manigault
jode
he
used
to
weigh
a
hundred
and
pounds
then
but
his
health
has
strengthened
in
that
climate
his
clothes
were
black
his
face
was
white
with
black
eyes
sharp
as
a
pin
he
had
the
shape
of
a
spout
the
same
narrow
size
all
the
way
down
and
his
voice
was
as
dry
and
light
as
an
in
his
first
days
at
cheyenne
he
had
constantly
challenged
large
cowboys
for
taking
familiarities
with
his
dignity
and
they
after
one
moment
bewilderment
had
concocted
apologies
that
entirely
met
his
exactions
and
gave
them
much
satisfaction
also
nobody
would
have
hurt
jode
for
the
world
in
time
he
came
to
see
that
wyoming
was
a
game
invented
after
his
book
of
rules
was
published
and
he
looked
on
but
could
not
play
the
game
he
had
fallen
along
with
other
incongruities
into
the
roaring
western
and
he
passed
his
careful
precise
days
with
barometers
and
he
answered
the
governor
with
official
and
south
carolina
impressiveness
there
is
no
indication
of
diminution
of
the
prevailing
pressure
he
said
well
that
what
i
thought
said
the
joyous
governor
so
i
going
to
whoop
her
what
do
you
expect
to
whoop
up
sir
atmosphere
and
all
that
said
the
governor
whole
business
has
got
to
get
a
move
on
i
sent
for
a
governor
you
are
certainly
a
wag
sir
said
jode
who
enjoyed
barker
as
some
people
enjoy
a
symphony
without
understanding
it
but
after
we
had
reached
the
club
and
were
lunching
and
jode
realized
that
a
letter
had
actually
been
written
telling
hilbrun
to
come
and
bring
his
showers
with
him
the
punctilious
officer
stated
his
position
have
your
joke
sir
he
said
waving
a
thin
clean
hand
but
i
decline
to
meet
hilbrun
said
the
governor
staring
if
that
his
name
yes
sir
as
a
member
of
the
weather
bureau
and
the
meteorological
society
i
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
glory
said
the
governor
well
i
suppose
not
i
see
your
point
jode
i
be
careful
to
keep
you
apart
as
a
member
of
the
college
of
physicians
i
felt
that
way
about
homeopathy
and
the
all
very
well
if
patients
will
call
in
but
ca
meet
in
consultation
but
three
months
drought
annually
jode
it
slow
too
slow
the
western
people
feel
that
this
conservative
method
the
zodiac
does
its
business
by
is
out
of
i
am
quite
serious
sir
said
jode
and
let
me
express
my
gratification
that
you
do
see
my
so
we
changed
the
subject
our
weather
scheme
did
not
at
first
greatly
move
the
public
beyond
those
who
made
up
the
purse
few
of
our
acquaintances
expressed
curiosity
about
hilbrun
and
next
afternoon
lin
mclean
told
me
in
the
street
that
he
was
disgusted
with
cheyenne
coldness
toward
the
enterprise
but
the
boys
would
fly
right
at
it
and
stay
with
it
if
the
was
near
town
you
bet
said
he
he
was
walking
alone
how
mclean
i
inquired
she
well
said
lin
turning
his
eye
from
mine
who
your
friend
all
bugged
up
in
english
clothes
about
as
good
a
man
as
you
said
i
and
more
him
and
his
said
the
sceptical
puncher
still
looking
away
from
me
and
surveying
ogden
who
was
approaching
with
the
governor
that
excellent
man
still
at
long
range
broke
out
smiling
till
his
teeth
shone
and
he
waved
a
yellow
paper
at
us
telegram
from
hilbrun
he
shouted
be
here
and
he
hastened
up
says
he
wants
a
cart
at
the
depot
and
a
small
building
where
he
can
be
private
added
ogden
great
is
it
you
bet
said
lin
brightening
the
new
yorker
urbane
but
obvious
excitement
mollified
mclean
ever
seen
rain
made
ogden
said
he
never
have
you
lin
had
not
ogden
offered
him
a
cigar
which
the
puncher
pronounced
excellent
and
we
all
agreed
to
see
hilbrun
arrive
we
going
to
show
the
telegram
to
jode
said
the
governor
and
he
and
ogden
departed
on
this
mission
to
the
signal
service
well
i
must
be
getting
along
myself
said
lin
but
he
continued
walking
slowly
with
me
where
yu
bound
he
said
nowhere
in
particular
said
i
and
we
paced
the
board
sidewalks
a
little
more
you
going
to
meet
the
train
said
he
the
train
oh
yes
hilbrun
you
be
there
yes
i
be
there
it
sure
been
a
dry
spell
ai
it
yes
just
like
last
year
in
fact
like
all
the
yes
i
never
saw
it
rain
any
to
speak
of
in
summer
i
expect
the
rule
do
you
i
should
i
do
guess
any
man
knows
enough
to
break
such
a
rule
do
you
no
but
it
be
fun
to
see
him
sure
fun
well
i
must
be
getting
along
see
yu
see
you
he
left
me
at
a
corner
and
i
stood
watching
his
tall
depressed
figure
a
hundred
yards
down
the
street
he
turned
and
seeing
me
looking
after
him
pretended
he
had
not
turned
and
then
i
took
my
steps
toward
the
club
telling
myself
that
i
had
been
something
of
a
skunk
for
i
had
inquired
for
mclean
in
a
certain
tone
and
i
had
hinted
to
lin
that
he
had
lacked
caution
and
this
was
nothing
but
a
way
of
saying
i
told
you
so
to
the
man
that
is
down
down
lin
certainly
was
although
it
had
not
come
so
home
to
me
until
our
little
walk
together
just
now
along
the
boards
at
the
club
i
found
the
governor
teaching
ogden
a
cheyenne
specialty
a
particular
drink
the
allston
cocktail
it
the
bitters
that
does
the
trick
he
was
saying
but
saw
me
and
called
out
you
ought
to
have
been
with
us
and
seen
jode
i
showed
him
the
telegram
you
know
he
read
it
through
and
just
handed
it
back
to
me
and
went
on
monkeying
with
his
anemometer
ever
seen
his
instruments
every
fresh
jigger
they
get
out
he
sends
for
well
he
monkeyed
away
and
would
say
a
word
so
i
said
understand
jode
this
telegram
comes
from
hilbrun
and
jode
he
quit
his
anemometer
and
said
make
no
doubt
sir
that
your
despatch
is
genuwine
oh
south
carolina
indignant
at
me
and
the
governor
slapped
his
knee
why
he
so
set
against
hilbrun
he
continued
i
guess
if
he
knew
of
something
he
could
explode
to
stop
rain
he
let
her
fly
no
he
would
said
i
he
not
consider
that
that
so
the
governor
assented
jode
play
it
was
thus
we
had
come
to
look
at
our
enterprise
a
game
between
a
respectable
weather
bureau
and
an
upstart
charlatan
and
it
was
the
charlatan
had
our
sympathy
as
all
charlatans
whether
religious
military
medical
political
or
what
not
have
with
the
average
american
we
met
him
at
the
station
that
is
ogden
mclean
and
i
and
the
governor
being
engaged
sent
unofficially
his
secretary
and
the
requested
cart
lin
was
anxious
to
see
what
would
be
put
in
the
cart
and
i
was
curious
about
how
a
would
look
but
he
turned
out
an
unassuming
quiet
man
in
blue
serge
with
a
face
you
could
not
remember
afterwards
and
a
few
civil
ordinary
remarks
he
even
said
it
was
a
hot
day
as
if
he
had
no
relations
with
the
weather
and
what
he
put
into
the
cart
were
only
two
of
no
special
significance
to
the
eye
he
desired
no
lodging
at
the
hotel
but
to
sleep
with
his
apparatus
in
the
building
provided
for
him
and
we
set
out
for
it
at
once
it
was
an
untenanted
barn
and
he
asked
that
he
and
his
assistant
might
cut
a
hole
in
the
roof
upon
which
we
noticed
the
assistant
for
the
first
time
a
tallish
young
man
but
with
a
weak
mouth
this
is
lusk
said
the
and
we
shook
hands
ogden
and
i
exchanging
a
glance
ourselves
and
the
cart
marched
up
hill
street
or
capitol
avenue
as
it
has
become
named
since
cheyenne
has
grown
fuller
of
pomp
and
emptier
of
prosperity
and
i
thought
we
made
an
unusual
procession
the
governor
secretary
unofficially
leading
the
way
to
the
barn
the
cart
and
the
beside
it
guarding
his
mysteries
mclean
and
lusk
walking
together
in
unconscious
bigamy
and
in
the
rear
odgen
nudging
me
in
the
ribs
that
it
was
the
correct
lusk
we
had
with
us
i
felt
sure
from
his
incompetent
healthy
vacant
appearance
and
shiftless
the
sort
of
man
to
weary
of
one
trade
and
another
and
make
a
failure
of
wife
beating
between
whiles
in
street
the
town
uttermost
rim
the
governor
met
us
and
stared
at
lusk
christopher
was
his
single
observation
but
he
never
forgets
a
face
can
not
afford
to
now
that
he
is
in
politics
and
besides
lusk
remembered
him
you
seldom
really
forget
a
man
to
whom
you
owe
ten
dollars
so
you
quit
hauling
poles
said
the
governor
nothing
in
it
sir
said
lusk
is
there
any
objection
to
my
having
a
hole
in
the
roof
asked
the
for
this
the
secretary
had
been
unable
to
tell
him
what
going
to
throw
your
bombs
through
it
said
the
governor
smiling
heartily
but
the
explained
at
once
that
his
was
not
the
bomb
system
but
a
method
attended
by
more
rain
and
less
disturbance
not
that
the
bomb
do
produce
results
at
times
and
under
circumstances
he
said
but
it
uncertain
and
the
governor
hesitated
about
the
hole
in
the
roof
which
hilbrun
told
us
was
for
a
metal
pipe
to
conduct
his
generated
gases
into
the
air
the
owner
of
the
barn
had
gone
to
laramie
however
we
found
a
hole
which
saved
delay
and
what
day
would
you
prefer
the
shower
said
hilbrun
after
we
had
gone
over
our
contract
with
him
any
day
would
do
the
governor
said
this
was
thursday
and
sunday
was
chosen
as
a
day
when
no
one
had
business
to
detain
him
from
witnessing
the
shower
though
it
seemed
to
me
that
on
too
business
in
cheyenne
was
not
so
inexorable
as
this
we
gave
the
strangers
some
information
about
the
town
and
left
them
the
sun
went
away
in
a
cloudless
sky
and
came
so
again
when
the
stars
had
finished
their
untarnished
shining
friday
was
clear
and
dry
and
hot
like
the
dynasty
of
blazing
days
that
had
gone
before
i
saw
a
sorry
spectacle
in
the
street
the
bridegroom
and
the
bride
shopping
together
or
rather
he
with
his
wad
of
bills
was
obediently
paying
for
what
she
bought
and
when
i
met
them
he
was
carrying
a
scarlet
parasol
and
a
his
with
the
lust
of
purchase
on
her
was
brilliantly
dressed
and
pervaded
the
street
with
splendor
like
an
escaped
parrot
lin
walked
beside
her
but
it
might
as
well
have
been
behind
and
his
bearing
was
so
different
from
his
wonted
that
i
had
a
mind
to
take
off
my
hat
and
say
but
it
was
mrs
mclean
i
said
of
course
she
gave
me
a
remote
imperious
nod
and
said
come
on
lin
something
like
a
cross
nurse
while
he
out
of
sheer
decency
made
her
a
jocular
answer
and
said
to
me
it
takes
a
woman
to
know
what
to
buy
for
which
poor
piece
of
hypocrisy
endeared
him
to
me
more
than
ever
the
puncher
was
not
of
the
fibre
to
succeed
in
keeping
appearances
but
he
deserved
success
which
the
angels
consider
to
be
enough
i
wondered
if
disenchantment
had
set
in
or
if
this
were
only
the
preliminary
stage
of
surprise
and
wounding
and
i
felt
that
but
one
test
could
show
namely
a
coming
face
to
face
of
and
lusk
perhaps
not
to
be
desired
neither
was
it
likely
the
assistant
kept
himself
steadfastly
inside
or
near
the
barn
at
the
north
corner
of
cheyenne
while
the
bride
when
she
was
in
the
street
at
all
haunted
the
shops
clear
across
town
diagonally
on
this
friday
noon
the
appearance
of
the
metal
tube
above
the
blind
building
spread
some
excitement
it
moved
several
of
the
citizens
to
pay
the
place
a
visit
and
ask
to
see
the
machine
these
callers
of
course
sustained
a
polite
refusal
and
returned
among
their
friends
with
a
contempt
for
such
quackery
and
a
greatly
heightened
curiosity
so
that
pretty
soon
you
could
hear
discussions
at
the
street
corners
and
by
saturday
morning
cheyenne
was
talking
of
little
else
the
town
prowled
about
the
barn
and
its
oracular
metal
tube
and
heard
and
saw
nothing
the
governor
and
i
let
it
be
confessed
went
there
ourselves
since
the
hours
of
required
preparation
were
now
begun
we
smelled
for
chemicals
and
he
thought
there
was
a
something
but
having
been
bred
a
doctor
distrusted
his
imagination
i
could
not
be
sure
myself
whether
there
was
anything
or
not
although
i
walked
three
times
round
the
barn
snuffing
as
dispassionately
as
i
knew
how
it
might
possibly
be
chlorine
the
governor
said
or
some
gas
for
which
ammonia
was
in
part
responsible
and
this
was
all
he
could
say
and
we
left
the
place
the
world
was
as
still
and
the
hard
sharp
hills
as
clear
and
near
as
ever
and
the
sky
over
sahara
is
not
more
dry
and
enduring
than
was
ours
this
tenacity
in
the
elements
plainly
gave
jode
a
malicious
official
pleasure
we
could
tell
it
by
his
talk
at
lunch
and
when
the
governor
reminded
him
that
no
rain
was
contracted
for
until
the
next
day
he
mentioned
that
the
approach
of
a
storm
is
something
that
modern
science
is
able
to
ascertain
long
in
advance
and
he
bade
us
come
to
his
office
whenever
we
pleased
and
see
for
ourselves
what
science
said
this
was
at
any
rate
something
to
fill
the
afternoon
with
and
we
went
to
him
about
five
lin
mclean
joined
us
on
the
way
i
came
upon
him
lingering
alone
in
the
street
and
he
told
me
that
mclean
was
calling
on
friends
i
saw
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
spend
the
short
recess
or
holiday
he
was
having
he
seemed
to
cling
to
the
society
of
others
and
with
them
for
the
time
regain
his
gayer
mind
he
had
become
converted
to
ogden
and
the
on
his
side
found
pleasant
and
refreshing
this
democracy
of
governors
and
jode
received
us
at
the
office
and
began
to
show
us
his
instruments
with
the
careful
pride
of
an
a
hair
hygrometer
he
said
to
me
waving
his
hand
over
it
the
indications
are
obtained
from
the
expansion
and
contraction
of
a
prepared
human
hair
transferred
to
an
index
needle
traversing
the
divided
arc
of
what
oil
do
you
put
on
the
human
hair
jode
called
out
the
governor
who
had
left
our
group
and
was
gamboling
about
by
himself
among
the
tubes
and
dials
what
will
this
one
do
he
asked
and
poked
at
a
wet
paper
disc
but
before
the
courteous
jode
could
explain
that
it
had
to
do
with
evaporation
and
the
the
governor
attention
wandered
and
he
was
blowing
at
a
little
this
instantly
revolved
and
set
a
number
of
dial
hands
going
different
ways
hi
said
the
governor
delighted
seen
like
that
down
mines
register
air
velocity
in
feet
put
it
away
jode
you
do
want
that
what
you
need
hilbrun
says
is
a
big
old
and
rubber
i
shall
require
nothing
of
the
sort
governor
jode
retorted
at
once
and
you
can
go
to
church
without
your
umbrella
in
safety
sir
see
he
pointed
to
a
which
was
certainly
as
clear
as
crystal
an
test
you
will
doubtless
say
gentlemen
jode
continued
though
none
of
us
would
have
said
anything
like
that
but
unjustly
discredited
and
furthermore
its
testimony
is
well
corroborated
as
you
will
find
you
must
jode
voice
was
almost
threatening
and
he
fetched
one
corroborator
after
another
i
looked
passively
at
wet
and
dry
bulbs
at
dotted
registers
i
caught
the
fleeting
sound
of
words
like
meniscus
and
terrestrial
minimum
thermometer
and
i
nodded
punctually
when
jode
went
through
some
calculation
at
last
i
heard
something
that
i
could
understand
a
series
of
telegraphic
replies
to
jode
from
brother
officers
all
over
the
united
states
he
read
each
one
through
from
date
of
signature
and
they
all
made
any
rain
entirely
impossible
and
i
tell
you
jode
concluded
in
his
high
voice
no
chance
of
precipitation
now
sir
i
tell
you
sir
he
was
shrieking
jubilantly
there
not
a
damn
thing
to
precipitate
we
left
him
in
his
triumph
among
his
glass
and
mercury
gee
whiz
said
the
governor
i
guess
we
better
go
and
tell
hilbrun
it
no
we
went
and
hilbrun
smiled
with
a
certain
compassion
for
the
antiquated
scientist
that
what
they
all
say
he
said
i
do
my
talking
if
any
of
you
gentlemen
or
your
friends
said
assistant
lusk
stepping
up
feel
like
doing
a
little
business
on
this
i
am
ready
to
accommodate
what
do
yu
want
this
evenin
said
lin
mclean
promptly
five
to
one
said
lusk
go
yu
in
twenties
said
the
impetuous
puncher
and
i
now
perceived
this
was
to
be
a
sporting
event
lin
had
his
wad
of
bills
out
or
what
of
it
still
survived
his
bride
shopping
will
you
hold
stakes
doctor
he
said
to
the
governor
but
that
official
looked
at
the
clear
sky
and
thought
he
would
do
five
to
one
in
twenties
himself
lusk
accommodated
him
and
then
ogden
and
then
me
none
of
us
could
very
well
be
but
we
registered
our
bets
and
promised
to
procure
an
uninterested
man
by
eight
next
morning
i
have
seldom
had
so
much
trouble
and
i
never
saw
such
a
universal
search
for
ready
money
every
man
we
asked
to
hold
stakes
instantly
whipped
out
his
own
pocketbook
went
in
search
of
lusk
and
disqualified
himself
it
was
jode
helped
us
out
he
would
not
bet
but
was
anxious
to
serve
and
thus
punish
the
bragging
lusk
sunday
was
as
usual
chronically
fine
with
no
cloud
or
breeze
anywhere
and
by
the
time
the
were
ringing
ten
to
one
was
freely
offered
the
went
to
church
with
her
friends
so
she
might
wear
her
fine
clothes
in
a
worthy
place
while
her
furloughed
husband
rushed
about
cheyenne
entirely
his
own
old
self
again
his
wad
of
money
staked
and
in
jode
keeping
many
citizens
bitterly
lamented
their
lack
of
ready
money
but
it
was
a
good
thing
for
these
people
that
it
was
sunday
and
the
banks
closed
the
ceased
the
congregations
sat
inside
but
outside
the
hot
town
showed
no
sunday
emptiness
or
quiet
the
metal
tube
the
possible
smell
jode
sustained
and
haughty
indignation
the
extraordinary
assurance
of
lusk
all
this
had
ended
by
turning
every
one
restless
and
eccentric
a
citizen
came
down
the
street
with
an
umbrella
in
a
moment
the
had
reduced
it
to
a
sordid
tangle
of
ribs
old
judge
burrage
attempted
to
address
us
at
the
corner
about
the
vast
progress
of
science
the
postmaster
pinned
a
card
on
his
back
with
the
legend
i
am
somewhat
of
a
liar
and
all
the
while
the
sun
shone
high
and
hot
while
jode
grew
quieter
and
colder
under
the
certainty
of
victory
it
was
after
twelve
when
the
people
came
from
church
and
no
change
or
sign
was
to
be
seen
jode
told
us
with
a
chill
smile
that
he
had
visited
his
instruments
and
found
no
new
indications
fifteen
minutes
after
that
the
sky
was
brown
sudden
padded
dropsical
clouds
were
born
in
the
blue
above
our
heads
they
blackened
and
a
smart
shower
the
first
in
two
months
wet
us
all
and
ceased
the
sun
blazed
out
and
the
sky
came
blue
again
like
those
rapid
unconvincing
weather
changes
of
the
drama
amazement
at
what
i
saw
happening
in
the
heavens
took
me
from
things
on
earth
and
i
was
unaware
of
the
universal
fit
that
now
seized
upon
cheyenne
until
i
heard
the
high
cry
of
jode
at
my
ear
his
usual
punctilious
bearing
had
forsaken
him
and
he
shouted
alike
to
stranger
and
acquaintance
it
is
no
sir
do
you
tell
me
and
the
crowd
would
swallow
him
but
you
could
mark
his
vociferous
course
as
he
went
proclaiming
to
the
world
a
failure
sir
the
fellow
an
impostor
as
i
well
knew
it
no
which
was
true
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
that
we
asked
hilbrun
swarming
around
him
if
you
just
keep
cool
said
he
it
only
the
first
instalment
in
about
two
hours
and
a
half
i
give
you
the
soon
after
four
the
dropsical
clouds
materialized
once
again
above
cheyenne
no
school
let
out
for
an
unexpected
holiday
no
herd
of
stampeded
range
cattle
conducts
itself
more
miscellaneously
gray
respectable
men
with
daughters
married
leaped
over
fences
and
sprang
back
prominent
legislators
hopped
howling
up
and
down
women
waved
handkerchiefs
from
windows
and
porches
the
chattering
jode
flew
from
anemometer
to
and
old
judge
burrage
apostrophized
providence
in
his
front
yard
with
the
postmaster
label
still
pinned
to
his
back
nobody
minded
the
sluicing
downpour
this
second
instalment
was
much
more
of
a
thing
than
the
first
and
hilbrun
alone
kept
a
calm
exterior
the
face
of
the
man
who
lifts
a
heavy
and
throws
an
impressive
glance
at
the
audience
assistant
lusk
was
by
no
means
thus
proof
against
success
i
saw
him
put
a
bottle
back
in
his
pocket
his
face
already
disintegrated
with
a
tipsy
leer
judge
burrage
perceiving
the
came
out
of
his
gate
and
proceeded
toward
him
extending
the
hand
of
congratulation
mr
hilbrun
said
he
i

the
honorable
coleman

favorably
impressed

and
lin
clapped
the
on
the
shoulder
exulting
he
had
been
too
well
entertained
to
care
what
he
had
in
his
pocket
and
his
wife
had
not
yet
occurred
to
him
they
were
disputing
about
the
rainfall
which
had
been
slightly
under
half
an
inch
in
a
few
spots
but
over
it
in
many
others
and
while
we
stood
talking
in
the
renewed
sunlight
more
telegrams
were
brought
to
jode
saying
that
there
was
no
moisture
anywhere
and
simultaneously
with
these
riders
dashed
into
town
with
the
news
that
twelve
miles
out
the
rain
had
flattened
the
grain
crop
we
had
more
of
such
reports
from
as
far
as
thirty
miles
and
beyond
that
there
had
not
been
a
drop
or
a
cloud
it
staggered
one
reason
the
brain
was
numb
with
surprise
well
gentlemen
said
the
i
packed
up
and
my
be
along
soon
would
have
been
along
by
this
only
it
late
what
the
word
as
to
my
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
even
still
there
were
objections
expressed
he
had
not
entirely
performed
his
side
of
the
contract
i
think
different
gentlemen
said
he
but
i
unpack
and
let
that
train
go
i
ca
have
the
law
on
you
i
suppose
but
if
you
do
pay
me
the
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
leaned
against
the
fence
i
flood
your
in
earthquakes
and
eruptions
people
end
by
expecting
anything
and
in
the
total
eclipse
that
was
now
over
all
cheyenne
ordinary
standards
and
precedents
the
bewildered
community
saw
in
this
threat
nothing
more
unusual
than
if
he
had
said
twice
two
made
four
the
purse
was
handed
over
i
obliged
said
hilbrun
simply
if
i
had
foreseen
gentlemen
said
jode
too
deeply
grieved
now
to
feel
anger
that
i
would
even
be
indirectly
associated
with
your
losing
your
money
through
this
this
absurd
occurrence
i
would
have
declined
to
help
you
it
becomes
my
duty
he
continued
turning
coldly
to
the
inebriated
lusk
to
hand
this
to
you
and
the
assistant
lurchingly
stuffed
his
stakes
away
it
worth
it
said
lin
he
welcome
to
my
what
that
you
say
lin
mclean
it
was
the
and
she
surged
to
the
front
i
broke
he
got
it
that
all
said
lin
briefly
broke
you
she
glared
at
her
athletic
young
lord
and
she
uttered
a
preliminary
howl
at
that
cry
lusk
turned
his
silly
face
it
my
darling
kate
he
said
why
kate
the
next
thing
that
i
knew
ogden
and
i
were
grappling
with
lin
mclean
for
everything
had
happened
at
once
the
bride
had
swooped
upon
her
first
wedded
love
and
burst
into
tears
on
the
man
neck
which
lin
was
trying
to
break
in
consequence
we
do
not
always
recognize
our
benefactors
at
sight
they
all
came
to
the
ground
and
we
hauled
the
second
husband
off
the
lady
and
lusk
remained
in
a
heap
he
foolish
tearful
and
affectionate
she
turned
furiously
at
bay
his
guardian
angel
indifferent
to
the
onlooking
crowd
and
hurling
righteous
defiance
at
lin
do
yus
dare
lay
yer

on
my
husband
you
bigamist

what
the
marvelous
female

repeated
lin
dazed
at
this
charge

murmured
the
puncher
her
and
me
whimpered
lusk
he
sat
up
with
a
limp
confiding
stare
at
everybody
sidney
who
said
lin
no
no
corrected
lusk
crossly
sidney
the
stakes
at
this
point
fell
from
his
pocket
which
he
did
not
notice
but
the
bride
had
them
in
at
once
who
are

anyway
when
yu
ai

him
and
jim
going
to
work

again
for
goodness
sake
somebody
lend
me
dollars
at
this
there
was
an
instantaneous
rush
ten
minutes
later
in
front
of
the
there
was
a
line
of
citizens
buying
tickets
for
salt
lake
as
if
it
had
been
madame
bernhardt
some
rock
had
been
smitten
and
ready
money
had
flowed
forth
the
governor
saw
us
off
sad
that
his
duties
should
detain
him
but
jode
went
betting
is
the
fool
argument
gentlemen
said
he
to
ogden
mclean
and
me
and
it
a
weary
time
since
i
have
had
the
which
way

my
principles
sir
answered
the
little
officer
i

jim
i
backin

i
i

into
another
car
and
i
did
and
so
yu
knowed
about

when
we
was
on

the
puncher
said

queer
world
all
the
same
yu

good
friends
and
all
he
looked
out
of
the
window
laramie
already
he
commented
and
got
out
and
walked
by
himself
on
the
platform
until
we
had
started
again
yu
have
good
friends
he
pursued
settling
himself
so
his
long
legs
were
stretched
and
comfortable
and
they
tell
yu
things
and
you
tell
them
things
and
when
it
do
make
no
particular
matter
one
way
or
the
other
give
your
honest
opinion
and
talk
straight
to
and
come
to
you
the
same
way
so
that
when
yu
ridin
the
range
alone
sometimes
and
thinkin
a
lot
o
things
over
on
top
maybe
of
some
hill
you
say
to
yourself
about
some
fellow
yu
know
mighty
well
a
man
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
yu
mean
it
and
it
so
yet
when
matters
is
serious
as
onced
in
a
while
they
bound
to
get
and
yu
in
a
plumb
hole
where
is
the
man
then
your
good
friend
why
he
where
yu
want
him
to
be
standin
off
keepin
his
mouth
shut
and
lettin
yu
find
your
own
trail
out
if
he
tried
to
show
it
to
yu
yu
likely
hit
him
but
shucks
circumstances
have
showed
me
the
trail
this
time
you
bet
and
the
puncher
face
which
had
been
sombre
grew
lively
and
he
laid
a
friendly
hand
on
my
knee
the
trail
pretty
simple
said
i
you
bet
but
it
sure
a
queer
world
tell
yu
said
lin
with
the
air
of
having
made
a
discovery
when
a
man
gets
down
to
affairs
in
this
life
he
got
to
do
his
travellin
alone
same
as
he
does
his
dyin
i
expect
even
married
men
has
thoughts
and
hopes
they
do
tell
their
never
was
married
said
i
well
no
more
was
i
let
go
to
and
lin
shook
my
hand
and
gave
me
a
singular
rather
melancholy
smile
at
salt
lake
city
which
ogden
was
glad
to
include
in
his
western
holiday
we
found
both
mormon
and
gentile
ready
to
give
us
odds
against
rain
only
i
noticed
that
those
of
the
true
faith
were
less
free
indeed
the
mormon
the
quaker
and
most
sects
of
an
isolated
doctrine
have
a
nice
prudence
in
money
during
our
brief
stay
we
visited
the
sights
floating
in
the
lake
listening
to
pins
drop
in
the
gallery
of
the
tabernacle
seeing
frescos
of
saints
in
robes
speaking
from
heaven
to
joseph
smith
in
the
sunday
clothes
of
a
modern
and
in
the
street
we
heard
at
a
distance
a
strenuous
domestic
talk
between
the
new
or
perhaps
i
should
say
the
original
husband
and
wife
she
corralled
sidney
cash
said
the
delighted
lin
he
ca
bet
nothing
on
this
and
then
after
all
this
time
it
did
rain
stripped
of
money
both
ways
cheyenne
having
most
fortunately
purchased
a
return
ticket
sought
its
home
the
perplexed
went
somewhere
else
without
his
assistant
lusk
exulting
wife
having
the
money
retained
him
with
her
good
luck
to
yu
sidney
said
lin
speaking
to
him
for
the
first
time
since
cheyenne
i
feel
a
heap
better
since
i
saw
yu
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
or
the
horrible
language
that
she
threw
after
him
jode
also
felt
a
heap
legitimate
science
had
triumphed
most
of
cheyenne
believes
with
jode
that
it
was
all
a
coincidence
south
carolina
had
bet
on
her
principles
and
won
from
lin
the
few
dollars
that
i
had
lent
the
puncher
and
what
will
you
do
now
i
said
to
lin
join
the
beef
balaam
payin
forty
dollars
i
guess
keep
a
single
a
journey
in
search
of
christmas
the
governor
descended
the
steps
of
the
capitol
slowly
and
with
pauses
lifting
a
list
frequently
to
his
eye
he
had
intermittently
pencilled
it
between
stages
of
the
forenoon
public
business
and
his
gait
grew
absent
as
he
recurred
now
to
his
jottings
in
their
accumulation
with
a
slight
pain
at
their
number
and
the
definite
fear
that
they
would
be
more
in
seasons
to
come
they
were
the
names
of
his
friends
children
to
whom
his
excellent
heart
moved
him
to
give
christmas
presents
he
had
put
off
this
regenerating
evil
until
the
latest
day
as
was
his
custom
and
now
he
was
setting
forth
to
do
the
whole
thing
at
a
blow
entirely
planless
among
the
guns
and
that
would
presently
surround
him
as
he
reached
the
highway
he
heard
himself
familiarly
addressed
from
a
distance
and
turning
saw
four
sons
of
the
alkali
jogging
into
town
from
the
plain
one
who
had
shouted
to
him
galloped
out
from
the
others
rounded
the
capitol
enclosure
and
approaching
with
radiant
countenance
leaned
to
reach
the
hand
of
the
governor
and
once
again
greeted
him
with
a
hilarious
hello
doc
governor
barker
seeing
mclean
unexpectedly
after
several
years
hailed
the
horseman
with
frank
and
lively
pleasure
and
inquiring
who
might
be
the
other
riders
behind
was
told
that
they
were
shorty
chalkeye
and
dollar
bill
come
for
christmas
and
dandies
to
hit
town
with
mclean
added
i
am
acquainted
with
them
assented
his
excellency
we
been
ridin
trail
for
twelve
weeks
the
continued
makin
our
beds
down
anywheres
and
eatin
the
same
old
chuck
every
day
so
we
shook
fried
beef
and
heifer
delight
and
we
goin
to
feed
then
mclean
overflowed
with
talk
and
pungent
confidences
for
the
holidays
already
rioted
in
his
spirit
and
his
tongue
was
loosed
over
their
coming
rites
we
soured
on
scenery
he
finished
in
his
drastic
idiom
sick
of
moonlight
and
and
we
heeled
for
a
big
call
on
me
remarked
the
governor
cheerily
when
you
ready
for
bromides
and
i
ai
no
more
protested
mclean
i
got
maturity
doc
since
i
seen
yu
at
the
and
i
a
heap
older
than
them
hospital
days
when
i
bust
my
leg
on
yu
three
or
four
glasses
and
quit
that
my
that
your
rule
too
inquired
the
governor
of
shorty
chalkeye
and
dollar
bill
these
gentlemen
of
the
saddle
were
sitting
quite
expressionless
upon
their
horses
we
ai
talkin
we
waitin
observed
chalkeye
and
the
three
cynics
smiled
amiably
well
doc
see
yu
again
said
mclean
he
turned
to
accompany
his
brother
but
in
that
particular
moment
fate
descended
or
came
up
from
whatever
place
she
dwells
in
and
entered
the
body
of
the
unsuspecting
governor
what
your
hurry
said
fate
speaking
in
the
official
hearty
manner
come
along
with
ca
do
it
where
are
yu
goin
christmasing
replied
fate
well
i
got
to
feed
my
horse
christmasing
yu
say
yes
i
buying
toys
you
what
for
oh
some
yourn
screeched
lin
precipitately
his
excellency
the
jovial
governor
opened
his
teeth
in
pleasure
at
this
for
he
was
a
bachelor
and
there
were
fifteen
upon
his
list
which
he
held
up
for
the
edification
of
the
hasty
mclean
not
mine
i
happy
to
say
my
friends
keep
marrying
and
settling
and
their
kids
call
me
uncle
and
climb
around
and
bother
and
i
forget
their
names
and
think
it
a
girl
and
the
mother
gets
mad
why
if
i
did
remember
these
little
folks
at
christmas
they
be
wondering
not
the
kids
they
just
break
your
toys
and
do
notice
but
the
mother
would
wonder
the
matter
with
barker
has
governor
barker
gone
back
on
us
that
where
the
strain
comes
he
broke
off
facing
mclean
with
another
spacious
laugh
but
the
had
ceased
to
smile
and
now
while
barker
ran
on
exuberantly
mclean
eyes
rested
upon
him
singular
and
intent
and
in
their
hazel
depths
the
last
gleam
of
jocularity
went
out
that
where
the
strain
comes
you
see
two
sets
of
acquaintances
grateful
patients
and
loyal
voters
and
i
got
to
keep
solid
with
both
outfits
especially
the
wives
and
mothers
they
the
people
so
drums
and
dolls
and
sheep
on
wheels
and
games
and
monkeys
on
a
stick
and
the
saleslady
shows
you
a
mechanical
bear
and
it
costs
too
much
and
you
forget
whether
the
judge
second
girl
is
nellie
or
susie
and
well
i
just
in
for
my
annual
circus
this
afternoon
you
in
luck
christmas
do
trouble
a
chap
fixed
like
lin
mclean
prolonged
the
sentence
like
a
distant
echo
a
chap
fixed
like
you
the
said
it
slowly
to
himself
no
he
seemed
to
be
watching
shorty
and
chalkeye
and
dollar
bill
going
down
the
road
that
a
new
idea
christmas
he
murmured
for
it
was
one
of
his
oldest
and
he
was
recalling
the
christmas
when
he
wore
his
first
long
trousers
comes
once
a
year
pretty
regular
remarked
the
prosperous
governor
seems
often
when
you
pay
the
i
have
made
a
christmas
gift
pursued
the
dreamily
not
for
for
lord
it
a
hundred
years
i
guess
i
do
know
anybody
that
has
any
right
to
look
for
such
a
thing
from
this
was
indeed
a
new
idea
and
it
did
not
stop
the
chill
that
was
spreading
in
his
heart
gee
whiz
said
barker
briskly
there
goes
twelve
i
got
to
make
a
start
sorry
you
ca
come
and
help
me
his
excellency
left
the
rider
sitting
motionless
and
forgot
him
at
once
in
his
own
preoccupation
he
hastened
upon
his
journey
to
the
shops
with
the
list
not
in
his
pocket
but
held
firmly
like
a
plank
in
the
imminence
of
shipwreck
the
nellies
and
susies
pervaded
his
mind
and
he
struggled
with
the
presentiment
that
in
a
day
or
two
he
would
recall
some
omitted
and
wretchedly
important
child
quick
made
him
look
up
and
mclean
passed
like
a
wind
the
governor
absently
watched
him
go
and
saw
the
pony
hunch
and
stiffen
in
the
check
of
his
speed
when
lin
overtook
his
companions
down
there
in
the
distance
they
took
a
side
street
and
barker
rejoicingly
remembered
one
more
name
and
wrote
it
as
he
walked
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
come
to
the
shops
and
met
face
to
face
with
mclean
the
boys
are
seein
after
my
horse
lin
rapidly
began
and
i
got
to
meet
sharp
at
one
we
twelve
weeks
shy
on
a
square
meal
see
and
this
first
has
been
a
date
from
back
i
like
to
here
mclean
cleared
his
throat
and
his
speech
went
less
smoothly
doc
i
like
just
for
a
while
to
watch
yu
gettin
them
monkeys
yu
the
governor
expressed
his
agreeable
surprise
at
this
change
of
mind
and
was
glad
of
mclean
company
and
judgment
during
the
impending
selections
a
picture
of
a
and
himself
discussing
a
couple
of
dolls
rose
nimbly
in
barker
mental
eye
and
it
was
with
an
imperfect
honesty
that
he
said
you
help
me
a
and
lin
quite
sincere
replied
thank
so
together
these
two
went
christmasing
in
the
throng
wyoming
chief
executive
knocked
elbows
with
the
spurred
and
jingling
waif
one
man
as
good
as
another
in
that
raw
hopeful
cattle
era
which
now
the
sobered
west
remembers
as
the
days
of
its
fond
youth
for
one
man
has
been
as
good
as
another
in
three
places
paradise
before
the
fall
the
rocky
mountains
before
the
wire
fence
and
the
declaration
of
independence
and
then
this
governor
beside
being
young
almost
as
young
as
lin
mclean
or
the
chief
justice
who
lately
had
celebrated
his
birthday
had
in
his
doctoring
days
at
drybone
known
the
with
that
familiarity
which
lasts
a
lifetime
without
breeding
contempt
accordingly
he
now
laid
a
hand
on
lin
tall
shoulder
and
drew
him
among
the
petticoats
and
toys
christmas
filled
the
windows
and
christmas
stirred
in
mankind
cheyenne
not
in
doctrine
or
litanies
and
with
the
opinion
that
a
world
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
nevertheless
was
flocking
together
neighbor
to
think
of
neighbor
and
every
one
to
remember
the
children
a
sacred
assembly
after
all
gathered
to
rehearse
unwittingly
the
articles
of
its
belief
the
creed
and
doctrine
of
the
child
lin
saw
them
hurry
and
smile
among
the
paper
fairies
they
questioned
and
hesitated
crowded
and
made
decisions
failed
utterly
to
find
the
right
thing
forgot
and
hastened
back
suffered
all
the
various
desperations
of
the
eleventh
hour
and
turned
homeward
dropping
their
parcels
with
that
undimmed
that
once
a
year
makes
gracious
the
universal
human
face
this
brotherhood
swam
and
beamed
before
the
brooding
eyes
and
in
his
ears
the
greeting
of
the
season
sang
children
escaped
from
their
mothers
and
ran
chirping
behind
the
counters
to
touch
and
meddle
in
places
forbidden
friends
dashed
against
each
other
with
rabbits
and
magic
lanterns
greeted
in
haste
and
were
gone
amid
the
sound
of
musical
boxes
through
this
tinkle
and
bleating
of
little
machinery
the
murmur
of
the
human
heart
drifted
in
and
out
of
mclean
hearing
fragments
of
home
talk
tendernesses
economies
intimate
first
names
and
dinner
hours
and
whether
it
was
joy
or
sadness
it
was
in
common
the
world
seemed
knit
in
a
single
skein
of
home
ties
two
or
three
came
by
whose
purses
must
have
been
slender
and
whose
purchases
were
humble
and
chosen
after
much
nice
adjustment
and
when
one
plain
man
dropped
a
word
about
both
ends
meeting
and
the
woman
with
him
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
saying
that
his
children
must
not
feel
this
year
was
different
lin
made
a
step
toward
them
there
were
hours
and
spots
where
he
could
readily
have
descended
upon
them
at
that
played
the
role
of
clinking
affluence
waved
thanks
aside
with
competent
blasphemy
and
tossing
off
some
infamous
whiskey
cantered
away
in
the
full
strut
of
the
frontier
but
here
was
not
the
moment
the
abashed
could
make
no
such
parade
in
this
place
the
people
brushed
by
him
back
and
forth
busy
upon
their
errands
and
aware
of
him
scarcely
more
than
if
he
had
been
a
spirit
looking
on
from
the
helpless
dead
and
so
while
these
weaving
needs
and
kindnesses
of
man
were
within
arm
touch
of
him
he
was
locked
outside
with
his
impulses
barker
had
in
the
natural
press
of
customers
long
parted
from
him
to
become
immersed
in
choosing
and
rejecting
and
now
with
a
fair
part
of
his
mission
accomplished
he
was
ready
to
go
on
to
the
next
place
and
turned
to
beckon
mclean
he
found
him
obliterated
in
a
corner
beside
a
image
of
santa
claus
standing
as
still
as
the
frosty
saint
he
looks
livelier
than
you
do
said
the
hearty
governor
been
slow
no
replied
the
thoughtfully
no
i
guess
this
uncertainty
was
expressed
with
such
gentleness
that
barker
roared
you
never
did
lie
to
me
he
said
long
as
i
known
you
well
never
mind
i
got
some
real
advice
to
ask
you
at
this
mclean
face
grew
more
alert
say
doc
said
he
what
do
yu
want
for
christmas
that
nobody
likely
to
give
yu
a
big
practice
big
enough
to
interfere
with
my
what
else
things
and
truck
i
oh
nothing
i
get
people
do
give
things
much
to
fellows
like
do
they
do
they
why
you
and
santa
claus
were
putting
up
any
scheme
on
my
stocking
well
i
believe
you
in
earnest
cried
his
excellency
that
simply
rich
here
was
a
thing
to
relish
the
frontier
comes
to
town
heeled
for
a
big
time
finds
that
presents
are
all
the
rage
and
must
immediately
give
somebody
something
oh
childlike
miscellaneous
frontier
so
thought
the
governor
and
it
seems
a
venial
misconception
my
dear
fellow
he
added
meaning
as
well
as
possible
i
do
want
you
to
spend
your
money
on
i
got
plenty
all
right
said
lin
shortly
plenty
not
the
point
i
take
as
many
drinks
as
you
please
with
you
you
did
expect
anything
from
me
that
ai
that
do
there
of
course
you
did
then
what
are
you
getting
proud
about
here
our
they
stepped
in
from
the
street
to
new
crowds
and
counters
now
pursued
the
governor
this
is
for
a
very
particular
friend
of
mine
here
they
are
now
which
of
those
do
you
like
best
they
were
sets
of
tennyson
in
cases
holding
little
volumes
equal
in
number
but
the
binding
various
and
mclean
reached
his
decision
after
one
look
that
said
he
and
laid
a
large
muscular
hand
upon
the
laureate
the
young
lady
behind
the
counter
spoke
out
acidly
and
lin
pulled
the
abject
hand
away
his
taste
however
happened
to
be
sound
or
at
least
it
was
at
one
with
the
governor
but
now
they
learned
that
there
was
a
distressing
variance
in
the
matter
of
price
the
governor
stared
at
the
delicate
article
of
his
choice
i
know
that
tennyson
is
what
she
is
what
wanted
he
muttered
and
feeling
himself
nudged
looked
around
and
saw
lin
extended
fist
this
gesture
he
took
for
a
facetious
sympathy
and
dolorously
grasping
the
hand
found
himself
holding
a
lump
of
bills
sheer
amazement
relaxed
him
and
the
matted
wealth
tumbled
on
the
floor
in
sight
of
all
people
barker
picked
it
up
and
gave
it
back
no
no
no
he
said
mirthful
over
his
own
inclination
to
be
annoyed
you
ca
do
that
just
as
much
obliged
lin
he
added
just
as
a
loan
doc
some
of
it
i
with
a
giggle
behind
the
counter
disturbed
them
both
but
the
sharp
young
lady
was
only
dusting
the
governor
at
once
paid
haughtily
for
tennyson
expensive
works
and
the
pushed
his
discountenanced
savings
back
into
his
clothes
making
haste
to
leave
the
book
department
of
this
shop
they
regained
a
mutual
ease
and
the
governor
became
waggish
over
lin
concern
at
being
too
rich
he
suggested
to
him
the
list
of
delinquent
taxpayers
and
the
latest
census
from
which
to
select
indigent
persons
he
had
patients
too
whose
inveterate
pennilessness
he
could
swear
cheerfully
to
since
you
want
to
bolt
from
your
own
money
he
remarked
yes
i
a
green
horse
assented
mclean
gallantly
ai
used
to
the
looks
of
a
bill
and
i
shy
at
from
his
face
that
jocular
mask
one
might
have
counted
him
the
most
serene
and
careless
of
vagrants
and
in
his
words
only
the
ordinary
voice
of
banter
spoke
to
the
governor
a
good
woman
it
may
well
be
would
have
guessed
before
this
the
sensitive
soul
in
the
blundering
body
but
barker
saw
just
the
familiar
whimsical
mclean
of
old
days
and
so
he
went
gayly
and
innocently
on
treading
upon
holy
ground
i
got
it
he
exclaimed
give
your
wife
the
ruddy
grinned
he
had
passed
through
the
world
of
woman
with
but
few
delays
rejoicing
in
informal
and
transient
entanglements
and
he
welcomed
the
turn
which
the
conversation
seemed
now
to
be
taking
if
you
give
me
her
name
and
address
said
he
with
the
future
entirely
in
his
mind
why
laramie
and
the
governor
feigned
surprise
say
doc
said
lin
uneasily
none
of
ai
married
me
since
i
saw
yu
then
she
has
written
from
laramie
said
the
hilarious
governor
and
mclean
understood
and
winced
in
his
spirit
deep
down
gee
whiz
went
on
barker
i
never
forget
you
and
lusk
that
day
but
the
mask
fell
now
you
talking
of
his
wife
not
mine
said
the
very
quietly
and
smiling
no
more
and
doc
i
going
to
say
a
word
to
yu
for
i
know
yu
always
been
my
good
friend
never
forget
that
day
myself
but
i
do
want
to
be
reminded
of
i
a
fool
lin
said
the
governor
generous
instantly
i
never
supposed
i
know
yu
did
doc
it
ai
you
that
the
fool
and
in
a
way
in
a
way
lin
speech
ended
among
his
crowding
memories
and
barker
seeing
how
wistful
his
face
had
turned
waited
but
i
ai
quite
the
same
fool
i
was
before
that
happened
to
me
the
resumed
though
maybe
my
actions
do
show
to
be
wiser
i
know
that
there
was
better
luck
than
a
man
like
me
had
any
call
to
look
the
sobered
barker
said
simply
yes
he
was
put
to
thinking
by
these
words
from
the
unsuspected
inner
man
out
in
the
bow
leg
country
lin
mclean
had
met
a
woman
with
thick
red
cheeks
calling
herself
by
a
maiden
name
and
this
was
his
whole
knowledge
of
her
when
he
put
her
one
morning
astride
a
mexican
saddle
and
took
her
fifty
miles
to
a
magistrate
and
made
her
his
lawful
wife
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
belief
his
intimates
were
confident
he
would
never
have
done
it
but
for
a
rival
racing
the
rival
and
beating
him
had
swept
mclean
past
his
own
intentions
and
the
marriage
was
an
inadvertence
he
jest
bumped
into
it
before
he
could
pull
up
they
explained
and
this
casualty
resulting
from
sporting
blood
had
entertained
several
hundred
square
miles
of
alkali
for
the
husband
the
joke
soon
died
in
the
immediate
weeks
that
came
upon
him
he
tasted
a
bitterness
worse
than
in
all
his
life
before
and
learned
also
how
deep
the
woman
when
once
she
begins
can
sink
beneath
the
man
in
baseness
that
was
a
knowledge
of
which
he
had
lived
innocent
until
this
time
but
he
carried
his
outward
self
serenely
so
that
citizens
in
cheyenne
who
saw
the
with
his
bride
argued
shrewdly
that
men
of
that
sort
liked
women
of
that
sort
and
before
the
strain
had
broken
his
endurance
an
unexpected
first
husband
named
lusk
had
appeared
one
sunday
in
the
street
prosperous
forgiving
and
exceedingly
drunk
to
the
arms
of
lusk
she
went
back
in
the
public
street
deserting
mclean
in
the
presence
of
cheyenne
and
when
cheyenne
saw
this
and
learned
how
she
had
been
lusk
for
eight
long
if
intermittent
years
cheyenne
laughed
loudly
lin
mclean
laughed
too
and
went
about
his
business
ready
to
swagger
at
the
necessary
moment
and
with
the
necessary
kind
of
joke
always
ready
to
shield
his
hurt
spirit
and
soon
of
course
the
matter
grew
stale
seldom
raked
up
in
the
bow
leg
country
where
lin
had
been
at
work
so
lately
he
had
begun
to
remember
other
things
beside
the
smouldering
humiliation
is
she
with
him
he
asked
barker
and
musingly
listened
while
barker
told
him
the
governor
had
thought
to
make
it
a
racy
story
with
the
moral
that
the
joke
was
now
on
lusk
but
that
inner
man
had
spoken
and
revealed
the
to
him
in
a
new
and
complicated
light
hence
he
quieted
the
proposed
lively
cadence
and
vocabulary
of
his
anecdote
about
the
house
of
lusk
but
instead
of
narrating
how
beat
on
mondays
wednesdays
and
fridays
and
took
his
turn
the
odd
days
thus
getting
one
ahead
of
his
lady
while
the
kid
lusk
had
outlined
his
opinion
of
the
family
by
recently
skipping
to
parts
unknown
barker
detailed
these
incidents
more
gravely
adding
that
laramie
believed
lusk
addicted
to
opium
i
do
guess
i
leave
my
card
on
said
mclean
grimly
if
i
strike
you
do
mind
my
saying
i
think
you
well
out
of
that
scrape
barker
ventured
shucks
no
that
all
right
doc
only
yu
see
now
a
man
gets
tired
pretending
onced
in
a
time
had
gone
while
they
were
in
talk
and
it
was
now
half
after
one
and
mclean
late
for
that
first
square
meal
so
the
friends
shook
hands
wishing
each
other
merry
christmas
and
the
hastened
toward
his
chosen
companions
through
the
stirring
cheerfulness
of
the
season
his
had
made
a
dull
beginning
among
the
toys
he
had
come
upon
people
engaged
in
a
pleasant
game
and
waited
shy
and
well
disposed
for
some
bidding
to
join
but
they
had
gone
on
playing
with
each
other
and
left
him
out
and
now
he
went
along
in
a
sort
of
hurry
to
escape
from
that
loneliness
where
his
human
promptings
had
been
lodged
with
him
useless
here
was
cheyenne
full
of
holiday
for
sale
and
he
with
his
pockets
full
of
money
to
buy
and
when
he
thought
of
shorty
and
chalkeye
and
dollar
bill
those
dandies
to
hit
a
town
with
he
stepped
out
with
a
brisk
false
hope
it
was
with
a
mental
hurrah
and
a
foretaste
of
a
good
time
coming
that
he
put
on
his
town
clothes
after
shaving
and
admiring
himself
and
sat
down
to
the
square
meal
he
ate
away
and
drank
with
a
robust
imitation
of
enjoyment
that
took
in
even
himself
at
first
but
the
sorrowful
process
of
his
spirit
went
on
for
all
he
could
do
as
he
groped
for
the
contentment
which
he
saw
around
him
he
began
to
receive
the
jokes
with
counterfeit
mirth
memories
took
the
place
of
anticipation
and
through
their
moody
shiftings
he
began
to
feel
a
distaste
for
the
company
of
his
friends
and
a
shrinking
from
their
lively
voices
he
blamed
them
for
this
at
once
he
was
surprised
to
think
he
had
never
recognized
before
how
light
a
weight
was
shorty
and
here
was
chalkeye
who
knew
better
talking
religion
after
two
glasses
presently
this
attack
of
noticing
his
friends
shortcomings
mastered
him
and
his
mind
according
to
its
wont
changed
at
a
stroke
i
celebrating
no
christmas
with
this
crowd
said
the
inner
man
and
when
they
had
next
remembered
lin
mclean
in
their
hilarity
he
was
gone
governor
barker
finishing
his
purchases
at
three
went
to
meet
a
friend
come
from
evanston
mclean
was
at
the
railway
station
buying
a
ticket
for
denver
denver
exclaimed
the
amazed
governor
that
what
i
said
stated
mclean
doggedly
gee
whiz
went
his
excellency
what
are
you
going
to
do
there
get
good
and
ca
you
find
enough
whiskey
in
cheyenne
i
drinking
champagne
this
the
went
out
on
the
platform
and
got
aboard
and
the
train
moved
off
barker
had
walked
out
too
in
his
surprise
and
as
he
stared
after
the
last
car
mclean
waved
his
wide
hat
defiantly
and
went
inside
the
door
and
he
says
he
got
maturity
barker
muttered
i
known
him
since
and
he
kept
about
eight
years
old
right
the
governor
was
cross
and
sorry
and
presently
crosser
his
jokes
about
lin
marriage
came
back
to
him
and
put
him
in
a
rage
with
the
departed
fool
yes
about
eight
or
six
said
his
excellency
justifying
himself
by
the
past
for
he
had
first
known
lin
the
boy
of
nineteen
supreme
in
length
of
limb
and
recklessness
breaking
horses
and
feeling
for
an
early
mustache
next
when
the
mustache
was
nearly
accomplished
he
had
mended
the
boy
badly
broken
thigh
at
drybone
his
skill
and
lin
utter
health
had
wrought
so
swift
a
healing
that
the
surgeon
overflowed
with
the
pride
of
science
and
over
the
bandages
would
explain
the
human
body
technically
to
his
and
flattered
patient
thus
young
lin
heard
all
about
tibia
and
comminuted
and
other
glorious
new
words
and
when
sleepless
would
rehearse
them
then
with
the
bone
so
nearly
knit
that
the
patient
might
leave
the
ward
on
crutches
to
sit
each
morning
in
barker
room
as
a
privilege
the
disobedient
child
of
had
slipped
out
of
the
hospital
and
hobbled
hastily
to
the
hog
ranch
where
whiskey
and
variety
waited
for
a
languishing
convalescent
here
he
grew
gay
and
was
soon
carried
back
with
the
leg
refractured
yet
barker
surgical
rage
was
disarmed
the
patient
was
so
forlorn
over
his
doctor
professional
chagrin
i
suppose
it
ai
no
better
this
morning
doc
he
had
said
humbly
after
a
new
week
of
bed
and
weights
your
right
leg
going
to
be
shorter
that
oh
gosh
i
been
and
spoiled
your
comminuted
ai
i
a
you
could
not
chide
such
a
boy
as
this
and
in
time
due
course
he
had
walked
jauntily
out
into
the
world
with
legs
of
equal
length
after
all
and
in
his
stride
the
slightest
halt
possible
and
doctor
barker
had
missed
the
child
conversation
his
mustache
was
a
perfected
thing
and
he
in
the
late
end
of
his
twenties
he
wake
up
about
noon
in
a
dive
without
a
cent
said
barker
then
he
come
back
on
a
freight
and
begin
over
at
the
denver
station
lin
mclean
passed
through
the
shoutings
and
omnibuses
and
came
to
the
beginning
of
seventeenth
street
where
is
the
first
saloon
a
customer
was
ordering
hot
scotch
and
because
he
liked
the
smell
and
had
not
thought
of
the
mixture
for
a
number
of
years
lin
took
hot
scotch
coming
out
upon
the
pavement
he
looked
across
and
saw
a
saloon
opposite
with
brighter
globes
and
windows
more
prosperous
that
should
have
been
his
choice
lemon
peel
would
undoubtedly
be
fresher
over
there
and
over
he
went
at
once
to
begin
the
whole
thing
properly
in
such
frozen
weather
no
drink
could
be
more
timely
and
he
sat
to
enjoy
without
haste
its
mellow
fitness
once
again
on
the
pavement
he
looked
along
the
street
toward
beneath
the
crisp
cold
electric
lights
and
three
little
bootblacks
gathered
where
he
stood
and
cried
shine
shine
at
him
remembering
that
you
took
the
third
turn
to
the
right
to
get
the
best
dinner
in
denver
lin
hit
on
the
skilful
plan
of
stopping
at
all
hot
scotches
between
but
the
next
occurred
within
a
few
yards
and
it
was
across
the
street
this
one
being
attained
and
appreciated
he
found
that
he
must
cross
back
again
or
skip
number
four
at
this
rate
he
would
not
be
dining
in
time
to
see
much
of
the
theatre
and
he
stopped
to
consider
it
was
a
german
place
he
had
just
quitted
and
a
huge
light
poured
out
on
him
from
its
window
which
the
proprietor
sentiment
had
made
into
a
show
lights
shone
among
a
pine
forest
where
beery
jovial
gnomes
sat
on
roots
and
reached
upward
to
santa
claus
he
grinning
fat
and
teutonic
held
in
his
right
hand
forever
a
foaming
glass
and
forever
in
his
left
a
string
of
sausages
that
dangled
down
among
the
gnomes
with
his
american
back
to
this
the
wearing
the
same
serious
absent
face
he
had
not
changed
since
he
ran
away
from
himself
at
cheyenne
considered
carefully
the
hot
scotch
question
and
which
side
of
the
road
to
take
and
stick
to
while
the
little
bootblacks
found
him
once
more
and
cried
shine
shine
monotonous
as
he
settled
to
stay
over
here
with
the
scotches
and
the
little
song
reaching
his
attention
he
suddenly
shoved
his
foot
at
the
nearest
boy
who
lightly
sprang
away
dare
you
to
touch
him
piped
a
dangerously
they
were
in
short
trousers
and
the
eldest
enemy
it
may
be
was
ten
do
hit
me
said
mclean
i
well

leave
him
be
said
one
what
he
layin
to
kick

billy
in
scorn

who
he
he
a
special
shrilled
the
leading
bird
sensationally
he
got
a
badge
and
he
goin
to
arrest
two
of
them
hopped
instantly
to
the
safe
middle
of
the
street
and
scattered
with
practiced
strategy
but
billy
stood
his
ground
dare
you
to
arrest
me
said
he
what
you
give
me
not
to
inquired
lin
and
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
arms
akimbo
nothing
i
done
nothing
announced
billy
firmly
but
even
in
the
last
syllable
his
voice
suddenly
failed
a
terror
filled
his
eyes
and
he
too
sped
into
the
middle
of
the
street
what
he
claim
you
lifted
inquired
the
leader
with
eagerness
tell
him
you
have
been
inside
a
store
we
can
prove
it
they
screamed
to
the
special
officer
say
said
the
lin
from
the
pavement
you
poor
judges
of
a
badge
you
his
tone
pleased
them
where
they
stood
wide
apart
from
each
other
mclean
also
remained
stationary
in
the
bluish
illumination
of
the
window
why
if
any
policeman
was
caught
wearin
this
here
said
he
following
his
sprightly
invention
he
get
arrested
this
struck
them
extremely
they
began
to
draw
together
billy
lingering
the
last
if
it
your
idea
pursued
mclean
alluringly
as
the
three
took
cautious
steps
nearer
the
curb
that
blue
clasped
hands
in
a
circle
of
red
stars
gives
the
bearer
the
right
to
put
folks
in
the
jug
why
get
somebody
else
to
black
my
boots
for
a
the
three
made
a
swift
rush
fell
on
simultaneous
knees
and
clattering
their
boxes
down
began
to
spit
in
an
industrious
circle
easy
wheedled
mclean
and
they
looked
up
at
him
staring
and
fascinated
not
having
three
feet
said
the
always
grave
and
slow
i
can
only
give
two
this
here
he
got
a
big
pistol
and
a
belt
exulted
the
leader
who
had
precociously
felt
beneath
lin
coat
you
a
smart
boy
said
lin
considering
him
and
yu
find
a
man
out
right
away
now
you
stand
off
and
tell
me
all
about
myself
while
they
fix
the
boots
and
a
dollar
goes
to
the
quickest
young
billy
and
his
competitor
flattened
down
each
to
a
boot
with
all
their
might
while
the
leader
ruefully
contemplated
mclean
that
a
you
got
ventured
he
right
again
some
day
maybe
you
be
wearing
one
of
your
own
if
the
angels
do
pull
yu
before
you
i
through
sang
out
towhead
rising
in
haste
small
billy
was
struggling
still
but
leaped
at
that
the
two
heads
bobbing
to
a
level
together
and
mclean
looking
down
saw
that
the
arrangement
had
not
been
a
good
one
for
the
boots
will
you
kindly
referee
said
he
forgivingly
to
the
leader
and
decide
which
of
them
smears
is
the
awfulest
but
the
leader
looked
the
other
way
and
played
upon
a
well
that
saves
me
money
said
mclean
jingling
his
pocket
i
guess
you
both
he
handed
each
of
them
a
dollar
now
he
continued
i
just
dassent
show
these
boots
uptown
so
this
time
it
a
dollar
for
the
best
the
two
went
palpitating
at
their
brushes
again
and
the
leader
played
his
with
brilliant
unconcern
lin
tall
and
brooding
leaned
against
the
jutting
sill
of
the
window
a
figure
somehow
plainly
strange
in
town
while
through
the
bright
santa
claus
holding
out
his
beer
and
sausages
perpetually
beamed
billy
was
laboring
gallantly
but
it
was
labor
the
perceived
and
billy
no
seasoned
expert
see
here
said
lin
stooping
i
show
yu
how
it
done
he
playin
that
toon
enough
to
steer
anybody
crooked
there
keep
your
blacking
soft
and
work
with
a
dry
lem
me
said
billy
i
got
to
so
he
finished
the
boot
his
own
way
with
wiry
determination
breathing
and
repolishing
and
this
event
was
also
adjudged
a
dead
heat
with
results
gratifying
to
both
parties
so
here
was
their
work
done
and
more
money
in
their
pockets
than
from
all
the
other
boots
and
shoes
of
this
day
and
towhead
and
billy
did
not
wish
for
further
trade
but
to
spend
this
handsome
fortune
as
soon
as
might
be
yet
they
delayed
in
the
brightness
of
the
window
drawn
by
curiosity
near
this
new
kind
of
man
whose
voice
held
them
and
whose
remarks
dropped
them
into
constant
uncertainty
even
the
omitted
leader
had
been
unable
to
go
away
and
nurse
his
pride
alone
is
that
a
secret
society
inquired
towhead
lifting
a
finger
at
the
badge
mclean
nodded
turruble
said
he
you
a
wells
fargo
detective
asserted
the
leader
play
your
harp
said
lin
are
you
a
a
desperaydo
whispered
towhead
oh
my
observed
mclean
sadly
what
has
our
jack
been
readin
he
a
cried
billy
i
seen
his
that
you
said
the
discovered
puncher
with
approval
you
do
but
i
bet
you
ca
tell
me
what
we
wearers
of
this
badge
have
sworn
to
do
this
at
this
they
craned
their
necks
and
glared
at
him
we
are
sworn
do
yu
jump
now
and
give
me
away
sworn
to
blow
off
three
bootblacks
to
a
ah
pshaw
they
backed
away
bristling
with
distrust
that
the
oath
fellows
yu
may
as
well
make
your
minds
up
for
i
have
it
to
do
dare
you
to
ah
and
after
dinner
it
the
to
see
children
of
captain
cant
they
screamed
shrilly
at
him
keeping
off
beyond
the
curb
i
ca
waste
my
time
on
such
smart
boys
said
mclean
rising
lazily
to
his
full
height
from
the
i
am
goin
somewhere
to
find
boys
that
ai
so
turruble
quick
stampeded
by
a
roast
he
began
to
lounge
slowly
away
serious
as
he
had
been
throughout
and
they
stopping
their
noise
short
swiftly
picked
up
their
boxes
and
followed
him
some
change
in
the
current
of
electricity
that
fed
the
window
disturbed
its
sparkling
light
so
that
santa
claus
with
his
arms
stretched
out
behind
the
departing
seemed
to
be
smiling
more
broadly
from
the
midst
of
his
flickering
brilliance
on
their
way
to
turkey
the
host
and
his
guests
exchanged
but
few
remarks
he
was
full
of
and
threw
off
a
comment
or
two
that
would
have
led
to
conversation
under
almost
any
circumstances
save
these
but
the
minds
of
the
guests
were
too
distracted
by
this
whole
state
of
things
for
them
to
be
capable
of
more
than
keeping
after
mclean
in
silence
at
a
wary
interval
and
with
their
mouths
during
most
of
the
journey
open
the
badge
the
pistol
their
patron
talk
and
the
unusual
dollars
wakened
wide
their
bent
for
the
unexpected
their
street
affinity
for
the
spur
of
the
moment
they
believed
slimly
in
the
turkey
part
of
it
but
what
this
man
might
do
next
to
be
there
when
he
did
it
and
not
to
be
trapped
kept
their
wits
jumping
deliciously
so
when
they
saw
him
stop
they
stopped
instantly
too
ten
feet
out
of
reach
this
was
denver
most
civilized
restaurant
that
one
which
mclean
had
remembered
with
foreign
dishes
and
private
rooms
where
he
had
promised
himself
among
other
things
champagne
mclean
had
never
been
inside
it
but
heard
a
tale
from
a
friend
and
now
he
caught
a
sudden
sight
of
people
among
geraniums
with
plumes
and
white
very
elegant
it
must
have
been
several
minutes
that
he
stood
contemplating
the
entrance
and
the
luxurious
couples
who
went
in
plumb
french
he
observed
at
length
and
then
shucks
in
a
key
less
confident
while
his
guests
ten
feet
away
watched
him
narrowly
eatin
patty
de
in
there
he
muttered
and
the
three
bootblacks
came
beside
him
say
fellows
said
lin
confidingly
i
was
raised
good
enough
for
them
dude
dishes
what
do
yu
say
after
a
place
where
yu
can
mention
oyster
stoo
without
givin
anybody
a
fit
what
do
yu
say
boys
that
lighted
the
divine
spark
of
brotherhood
ah
you
come
along
with
us
we
take
yer
you
do
want
to
go
in
there
we
show
yer
the
boss
place
in
market
street
we
wo
lose
so
shouting
together
in
their
shrill
little
city
trebles
they
clustered
about
him
and
one
pulled
at
his
coat
to
start
him
he
started
obediently
and
walked
in
their
charge
they
leading
the
way
christmas
is
comin
now
sure
said
lin
grinning
to
himself
it
ai
exactly
what
i
figured
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
laughed
since
cheyenne
and
he
brushed
a
hand
over
his
eyes
that
were
dim
with
the
new
warmth
in
his
heart
believing
at
length
in
him
and
his
turkey
the
alert
street
faces
so
suspicious
of
the
unknown
looked
at
him
with
ready
intimacy
as
they
went
along
and
soon
in
the
friendly
desire
to
make
him
acquainted
with
denver
the
three
were
patronizing
him
only
billy
perhaps
now
and
then
stole
at
him
a
doubtful
look
the
large
country
mouse
listened
solemnly
to
his
three
town
mice
who
presently
introduced
him
to
the
place
in
market
street
it
was
not
boss
precisely
and
denver
knows
better
neighborhoods
but
the
turkey
and
the
oyster
stew
were
there
with
catsup
and
vegetables
in
season
and
several
choices
of
pie
here
the
country
mouse
became
again
efficient
and
to
witness
his
liberal
mastery
of
ordering
and
imagine
his
pocket
and
its
wealth
which
they
had
heard
and
partly
seen
renewed
in
the
guests
a
transient
awe
as
they
dined
however
and
found
the
host
as
frankly
ravenous
as
themselves
this
reticence
evaporated
and
they
all
grew
fluent
with
oaths
and
opinions
at
one
or
two
words
indeed
mclean
stared
and
had
a
slight
sense
of
blushing
have
a
cigarette
said
the
leader
over
his
pie
thank
yu
said
lin
i
wo
smoke
if
yu
excuse
he
had
devised
a
wholesome
meal
with
water
to
drink
chewin
no
good
at
meals
continued
the
boy
do
you
use
tobaccer
onced
in
a
the
leader
spat
brightly
he
ai
learned
yet
said
he
slanting
his
elbows
at
billy
and
sliding
a
match
over
his
rump
but
beer
now
i
never
seen
anything
in
he
and
towhead
soon
left
billy
and
his
callow
profanities
behind
and
engaged
in
a
town
conversation
that
silenced
him
and
set
him
listening
with
all
his
admiring
young
might
nor
did
mclean
join
in
the
talk
but
sat
embarrassed
by
this
knowledge
which
seemed
about
as
much
as
he
knew
himself
i
be
goshed
he
thought
if
i
caught
on
to
half
that
when
i
was
streakin
around
in
short
pants
maybe
they
grow
up
quicker
but
now
the
country
mouse
perceived
billy
eager
and
attentive
apprenticeship
hello
boys
he
said
that
theatre
got
a
big
start
on
they
had
all
forgotten
he
had
said
anything
about
theatre
and
other
topics
left
their
impatient
minds
while
the
country
mouse
paid
the
bill
and
asked
to
be
guided
to
the
this
man
here
will
look
out
for
your
blackin
and
truck
and
let
yu
have
it
in
the
they
were
very
late
the
spectacle
had
advanced
far
into
passages
of
the
highest
thrill
and
denver
eyes
were
riveted
upon
a
ship
and
some
icebergs
the
party
found
its
seats
during
several
beautiful
effects
and
that
remarkable
of
violins
which
is
pronounced
so
helpful
in
times
of
peril
and
sentiment
the
children
of
captain
grant
had
been
tracking
their
father
all
over
the
equator
and
other
scenic
spots
and
now
the
north
pole
was
about
to
impale
them
the
captain
youngest
child
perceiving
a
hummock
rushing
at
them
with
a
sudden
motion
loudly
shouted
sister
the
ice
is
closing
in
and
she
replied
chastely
then
let
us
it
was
a
superb
tableau
the
ice
split
and
the
sun
rose
and
joggled
at
once
to
the
zenith
the
fell
and
male
denver
wrung
to
its
religious
deeps
went
out
to
the
of
course
mclean
and
his
party
did
not
do
this
the
party
had
applauded
exceedingly
the
defeat
of
the
elements
and
the
leader
with
towhead
discussed
the
probable
chances
of
the
ship
getting
farther
south
in
the
next
act
until
lately
billy
doubt
of
the
had
lingered
but
during
this
intermission
whatever
had
been
holding
out
in
him
seemed
won
and
in
his
eyes
that
he
turned
stealthily
upon
his
unconscious
quiet
neighbor
shone
the
beginnings
of
do
you
think
this
is
splendid
said
he
splendid
lin
replied
a
trifle
remotely
do
you
like
it
when
they
all
get
balled
up
and
get
out
that
way
humming
said
lin
do
you
guess
it
just
girls
though
that
do
that
what
young
fellow
why
all
that
an
i
guess
it

she
said
to
do
it
when
the
ice
scared
her
an
of
course
a
man
had
to
do
what
she
wanted
well

done
it
if
she
had
been
on
that
boat
and
clung
around
an
cried
an
everything

made
her
friends
feel
bad
i
hardly
expect
they
would
replied
the
honest
lin
and
then
suddenly
mindful
of
billy
except
there
was
nothin
else
they
could
think
of
he
added
wishing
to
speak
favorably
of
the
custom
why
that
chunk
of
ice
were
so
awful
big
anyhow
i
shoved
her
off
with
a
pole

camp
with

i
some
time
billy
had
drawn
nearer
to
lin
and
was
looking
up
at
him
adoringly
you
bet
said
lin
and
though
he
did
not
perhaps
entirely
mean
this
it
was
with
a
curiously
softened
face
that
he
began
to
look
at
billy
as
with
dogs
and
his
horse
so
always
he
played
with
what
children
he
met
the
few
in
his
world
but
this
was
ceasing
to
be
quite
play
for
him
and
his
hand
went
to
the
boy
shoulder
father
took
me
camping
with
him
once
the
time
mother
was
off
father
gets
awful
drunk
too
i
quit
laramie
for
lin
sat
up
and
his
hand
gripped
the
boy
laramie
said
he
almost
shouting
it
yu
yu
is
your
name
lusk
but
the
boy
had
shrunk
from
him
instantly
you
not
going
to
take
me
home
he
piteously
wailed
heaven
and
heavens
murmured
lin
mclean
so
you
her
kid
he
relaxed
again
down
in
his
chair
his
legs
stretched
their
straight
length
below
the
chair
in
front
he
was
waked
from
his
bewilderment
by
a
brushing
under
him
and
there
was
young
billy
diving
for
escape
to
the
aisle
like
the
cornered
city
mouse
that
he
was
lin
nipped
that
poor
little
attempt
and
had
the
limp
billy
seated
inside
again
before
the
two
in
discussion
beyond
had
seen
anything
he
had
said
not
a
word
to
the
boy
and
now
watched
his
unhappy
eyes
seizing
upon
the
various
exits
and
dispositions
of
the
theatre
nor
could
he
imagine
anything
to
tell
him
that
should
restore
the
perished
confidence
why
did
yu
lead
him
off
he
asked
himself
unexpectedly
and
found
that
he
did
not
seem
to
know
but
as
he
watched
the
restless
and
estranged
runaway
he
grew
more
and
more
sorrowful
i
just
hate
him
to
think
that
of
me
he
reflected
the
curtain
rose
and
he
saw
billy
make
up
his
mind
to
wait
until
they
should
all
be
going
out
in
the
crowd
while
the
children
of
captain
grant
grew
hotter
and
hotter
upon
their
father
geographic
trail
lin
sat
saying
to
himself
a
number
of
contradictions
he
nothing
to
me
what
any
of
them
to
me
driven
to
bay
by
his
bewilderment
he
restated
the
facts
of
the
past
why
she
deserted
him
and
lusk
before
she
ever
laid
eyes
on
me
i
need
to
bother
myself
he
was
never
even
my
the
past
however
brought
no
guidance
lord
the
thing
to
do
about
this
if
i
had
any
home
this
is
a
stinkin
world
in
some
respects
said
mclean
aloud
unknowingly
the
lady
in
the
chair
beneath
which
the
had
his
legs
nudged
her
husband
they
took
it
for
emotion
over
the
sad
fortune
of
captain
grant
and
their
backs
shook
presently
each
turned
and
saw
the
singular
man
with
untamed
eyes
glowering
at
the
stage
and
both
backs
shook
again
once
more
his
hand
was
laid
on
billy
say
the
boy
glanced
at
him
and
quickly
away
look
at
me
and
billy
swervingly
obeyed
i
ai
after
yu
and
never
was
this
here

business

the
boy
made
a
nod
and

proceeded
whispering

thank

your
the
clerk
placed
himself
at
the
disposal
of
the
secret
service
and
lin
walked
up
and
down
looking
at
the
railroad
photographs
for
some
ten
minutes
when
master
billy
peered
in
from
the
street
hello
said
mclean
casually
and
returned
to
a
fine
picture
of
pike
peak
billy
observed
him
for
a
space
and
receiving
no
further
attention
came
stepping
along
i
not
back
to
laramie
he
stated
warningly

but
the
earnestly
petitioned
clerk
consented
and
billy
was
the
first
to
hasten
into
the
room
he
stood
rapturous
while
lin
buckled
the
belt
round
his
scanty
stomach
and
ingeniously
buttoned
the
suspenders
outside
the
accoutrement
to
retard
its
immediate
descent
to
earth
did
it
ever
kill
a
man
asked
billy

he
brought
out
a
small
tin
box
shaped
like
a
thimble
in
which
were
things
that
rattled
mclean
gave
it
up
that
seed
you
can
have
that
for
i
got
some
more
with
the
lin
received
this
second
token
also
and
thanked
the
giver
for
it
his
first
feeling
had
been
to
prevent
the
boy
parting
with
his
treasures
but
something
that
came
not
from
the
polish
of
manners
and
experience
made
him
know
that
he
should
take
them
billy
talked
away
laying
bare
his
little
soul
the
street
boy
that
was
not
quite
come
made
place
for
the
child
that
was
not
quite
gone
and
unimportant
words
and
confidences
dropped
from
him
disjointed
as
he
climbed
to
the
knee
of
mclean
and
inadvertently
took
that
for
some
sort
of
parent
he
had
not
hitherto
met
it
lasted
but
a
short
while
however
for
he
went
to
sleep
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
with
his
head
upon
lin
breast
the
man
held
him
perfectly
still
because
he
had
not
the
faintest
notion
that
billy
would
be
impossible
to
disturb
at
length
he
spoke
to
him
suggesting
that
bed
might
prove
more
comfortable
and
finding
how
it
was
rose
and
undressed
the
boy
and
laid
him
between
the
sheets
the
arms
and
legs
seemed
aware
of
the
moves
required
of
them
and
stirred
conveniently
and
directly
the
head
was
upon
the
pillow
the
whole
small
frame
burrowed
down
without
the
opening
of
an
eye
or
a
change
in
the
breathing
lin
stood
some
time
by
the
bedside
with
his
eyes
on
the
long
curling
lashes
and
the
curly
hair
then
he
glanced
craftily
at
the
door
of
the
room
and
at
himself
in
the
he
stooped
and
kissed
billy
on
the
forehead
and
rising
from
that
gave
himself
a
hangdog
stare
in
the
mirror
and
soon
in
his
own
bed
was
sleeping
the
sound
sleep
of
health
he
was
faintly
roused
by
the
church
bells
and
lay
still
lingering
with
his
sleep
his
eyes
closed
and
his
thoughts
unshaped
as
he
became
slowly
aware
of
the
morning
the
ringing
and
the
light
reached
him
and
he
waked
wholly
and
still
lying
quiet
considered
the
strange
room
filled
with
the
bells
and
the
sun
of
the
winter
day
where
have
i
struck
now
he
inquired
and
as
last
night
returned
abruptly
upon
his
mind
he
raised
himself
on
his
arm
there
sat
responsibility
in
a
chair
washed
clean
and
dressed
watching
him
you
awful
late
said
responsibility
but
i
were
without
telling
you

exclaimed
lin

made
his
voice
very
plaintive

responsibility
free
after
all
his
trouble
to
catch
him
this
was
more
than
he
could
do
i
got
to
go
if

thought

a
convincing
eye

billy

he
to
the
man

he
slammed
the
door
and
went
he
found
young
bill
on
guard
over
a
table
for
four
with
all
the
chairs
tilted
against
it
as
warning
to
strangers
no
one
sat
at
any
other
table
or
came
into
the
room
for
it
was
late
and
the
place
quite
emptied
of
breakfasters
and
the
several
entertained
waiters
had
gathered
behind
billy
back
lin
provided
a
thorough
meal
and
billy
pronounced
the
flannel
cakes
superior
to
flapjacks
which
were
not
upon
the
bill
of
fare

that
the
finest

fell
into
that
cheerful
strain
of
comment
which
unreplied
to
yet
goes
on
contented
and
while
mclean
gave
amiable
signs
of
assent
but
chiefly
looked
out
of
the
window
and
when
the
now
interested
waiter
said
respectfully
that
he
desired
to
close
the
room
they
went
out
to
the
office
where
the
money
was
got
out
of
the
safe
and
the
bill
paid
the
streets
were
full
of
the
bright
sun
and
seemingly
at
denver
gates
stood
the
mountains
sparkling
an
air
crisp
and
pleasant
wafted
from
their
peaks
no
smoke
hung
among
the
roofs
and
the
sky
spread
wide
over
the
city
without
a
stain
it
was
holiday
up
among
the
chimneys
and
tall
buildings
and
down
among
the
quiet
below
as
well
and
presently
from
their
scattered
pinnacles
through
the
town
the
bells
broke
out
against
the
jocund
silence
of
the
morning
do
you
like
music
inquired
billy
yes
said
lin
ladies
with
their
husbands
and
children
were
passing
and
meeting
orderly
yet
gayer
than
if
it
were
only
sunday
and
the
salutations
of
christmas
came
now
and
again
to
the
ears
but
possessor
of
his
own
share
in
this
lin
looked
at
every
one
with
a
sort
of
friendly
challenge
and
young
billy
talked
along
beside
him
do
you
think
we
could
go
in
here
billy
asked
a
church
door
was
open
and
the
rich
organ
sounded
through
to
the
pavement
they
good
music
here
an
they
keep
it
up
without
much
talking
between
i
been
in
lots
of
they
went
in
and
sat
to
hear
the
music
better
than
the
organ
it
seemed
to
them
were
the
harmonious
voices
raised
from
somewhere
outside
like
unexpected
visitants
and
the
pair
sat
in
their
back
seat
too
deep
in
listening
to
the
processional
hymn
to
think
of
rising
in
decent
imitation
of
those
around
them
the
crystal
melody
of
the
refrain
especially
reached
their
understandings
and
when
for
the
fourth
time
shout
the
glad
tidings
exultingly
sing
pealed
forth
and
ceased
both
the
delighted
faces
fell
do
you
wish
there
was
more
billy
whispered
wish
there
was
a
hundred
verses
answered
lin
but
canticles
and
responses
followed
with
so
little
talking
between
them
they
were
held
spellbound
seldom
thinking
to
rise
or
kneel
lin
eyes
roved
over
the
church
dwelling
upon
the
pillars
in
their
evergreen
the
flowers
and
leafy
wreaths
the
texts
of
white
and
gold
towards
men
he
read
that
so
peace
and
yes
that
so
i
expect
they
got
that
somewheres
in
the
bible
it
awful
good
and
you
never
think
of
it
there
was
a
touch
on
his
arm
and
a
woman
handed
a
book
to
him
this
is
the
hymn
we
have
now
she
whispered
gently
and
lin
blushing
scarlet
took
it
passively
without
a
word
he
and
billy
stood
up
and
held
the
book
together
dutifully
reading
the
words
it
came
upon
the
midnight
clear
that
glorious
song
of
old
from
angels
bending
near
the
earth
to
touch
their
harps
of
gold
peace
on
the
earth
this
tune
was
more
beautiful
than
all
and
lin
lost
himself
in
it
until
he
found
billy
recalling
him
with
a
finger
upon
the
words
the
concluding
ones
and
the
whole
world
sent
back
the
song
which
now
the
angels
the
music
rose
and
descended
to
its
lovely
and
simple
end
and
for
a
second
time
in
denver
lin
brushed
a
hand
across
his
eyes
he
turned
his
face
from
his
neighbor
frowning
crossly
and
since
the
heart
has
reasons
which
reason
does
not
know
he
seemed
to
himself
a
fool
but
when
the
service
was
over
and
he
came
out
he
repeated
again
and
when
i
run
on
to
the
bishop
of
wyoming
i
tell
him
if
he
preach
on
them
words
i
be
could
we
shoot
your
pistol
now
asked
billy
sure
boy
ai
yu
hungry
though
no
i
wish
we
were
away
off
up
there
do
you
the
mountains
they
look
pretty
so
white
a
heap
better
houses
why
we
go
there
there
trains
to
golden
we
shoot
around
among
the
to
golden
they
immediately
went
and
after
a
meal
there
wandered
in
the
open
country
until
the
cartridges
were
gone
the
sun
was
low
and
billy
was
walked
off
his
young
heels
a
truth
he
learned
complete
in
one
horrid
moment
and
battled
to
conceal
lame
he
echoed
angrily
i
shucks
said
lin
after
the
next
ten
steps
you
are
and
both
tell
you
there
stones
here
an
i
just
lin
briefly
took
the
boy
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
to
golden
i
played
out
myself
he
said
sitting
in
the
hotel
and
looking
lugubriously
at
billy
on
a
bed
and
i
ai
fit
to
have
charge
of
a
he
came
and
put
his
hand
on
the
boy
head
i
not
sick
said
the
cripple
i
tell
you
i
bully
you
wait
see
me
eat
but
lin
had
hot
water
and
cold
water
and
salt
and
was
an
hour
upon
his
knees
bathing
the
hot
feet
and
then
billy
could
not
eat
dinner
there
was
a
doctor
in
golden
but
in
spite
of
his
light
prescription
and
most
reasonable
observations
mclean
passed
a
foolish
night
of
vigil
while
billy
slept
quite
well
at
first
and
as
the
hours
passed
better
and
better
in
the
morning
he
was
entirely
brisk
though
stiff
i
could
work
quick
he
said
but
i
guess
one
day
wo
lose
me
my
how
d
yu
mean
asked
lin
why
i
got
regulars
you
know

said
billy
surprised
at
the
swearing
into
which
mclean
now
burst
an
i
ai
big
enough
to
get
to
make
money
at
any
other
i

muttered
lin
i

mclean
pete

learned
me
and
sidney
a
lot
pursued
billy
engagingly
i
bet
he
has
growled
the
and
again
billy
was
taken
aback
at
his
language
it
was
not
so
simple
this
case
to
the
perturbed
mind
of
mclean
it
grew
less
simple
during
that
day
at
golden
while
billy
recovered
and
talked
and
ate
his
innocent
meals
the
was
far
too
wise
to
think
for
a
single
moment
of
restoring
the
runaway
to
his
debauched
and
shiftless
parents
possessed
of
some
imagination
he
went
through
a
scene
in
which
he
appeared
at
the
lusk
threshold
with
billy
and
forgiveness
and
intruded
upon
a
conjugal
assault
and
battery
shucks
said
he
the
kid
would
be
off
again
inside
a
week
and
i
do
want
him
there
denver
upon
the
following
day
saw
the
little
bootblack
again
at
his
corner
with
his
trade
not
lost
but
near
him
stood
a
tall
singular
man
with
hazel
eyes
and
a
sulky
expression
and
citizens
during
that
week
noticed
as
a
new
sight
in
the
streets
the
tall
man
and
the
little
boy
walking
together
sometimes
they
would
be
in
shops
the
boy
seemed
as
happy
as
possible
talking
constantly
while
the
man
seldom
said
a
word
and
his
face
was
serious
upon
eve
governor
barker
was
overtaken
by
mclean
riding
a
horse
up
hill
street
cheyenne
hello
said
barker
staring
humorously
through
his
glasses
have
a
good
drunk
changed
my
mind
said
lin
grinning
proves
i
got
one
struck
christmas
all
right
who
your
friend
inquired
his
excellency
this
is
mister
billy

and
me

henry
foreman
and
his
wife
wo
board
him
at
sunk
creek
why
i
fix
it
the
and
his
responsibility
rode
on
together
toward
the
open
plain
sufferin
moses
remarked
his
excellency
separ
vigilante
we
had
fallen
half
asleep
my
pony
and
i
as
we
went
jogging
and
jogging
through
the
long
sunny
afternoon
our
hills
of
yesterday
were
a
coast
sunk
almost
away
behind
us
and
ahead
our
goal
lay
shining
a
little
island
of
houses
in
this
quiet
of
for
two
hours
it
had
looked
as
clear
and
near
as
now
rising
into
sight
across
the
huge
dead
calm
and
sinking
while
we
travelled
our
undulating
imperceptible
miles
the
train
had
come
and
gone
invisibly
except
for
its
slow
pillar
of
smoke
i
had
watched
move
westward
against
wyoming
stainless
sky
though
i
was
still
far
off
the
and
other
buildings
stood
out
plain
and
complete
to
my
eyes
like
blocks
arranged
and
forgotten
on
the
floor
so
i
rode
along
hypnotized
by
the
sameness
of
the
lazy
splendid
plain
and
almost
unaware
of
the
distant
rider
till
suddenly
he
was
close
and
hailing
me
they
caved
he
shouted
who
i
cried
thus
awakened
ah
the
fool
company
said
he
quieting
his
voice
as
he
drew
near
they
shed
their
haughtiness
he
added
confidingly
as
if
i
must
know
all
about
it
where
did
they
learn
that
wisdom
i
asked
not
knowing
in
the
least
experience
he
called
over
his
shoulder
for
already
we
had
met
and
passed
nothing
like
experience
for
sweating
the
fat
off
the
he
yelled
me
a
brotherly
and
i
am
sorry
never
to
have
known
more
of
him
for
i
incline
to
value
any
stranger
so
joyous
but
now
i
waked
the
pony
and
trotted
briskly
surmising
as
to
the
company
and
its
haughtiness
i
had
been
viewing
my
destination
across
the
sagebrush
for
so
a
time
that
as
constantly
in
wyoming
journeys
the
emotion
of
arrival
had
evaporated
long
before
the
event
and
i
welcomed
employment
for
my
otherwise
mind
probably
he
meant
the
railroad
company
certainly
something
large
had
happened
even
as
i
dismounted
at
the
platform
another
hilarious
came
out
of
the
station
and
at
once
remarking
they
going
to
leave
us
alone
sprang
on
his
horse
and
galloped
to
the
corrals
down
the
line
where
some
cattle
were
being
loaded
into
a
train
i
went
inside
for
my
mail
and
here
were
four
more
playing
with
the
agent
they
had
got
a
letter
away
from
him
and
he
wore
his
daily
look
of
anxiety
to
appreciate
the
jests
of
these
rollicking
people
read
it
they
said
to
me
and
i
did
read
the
private
document
and
learned
that
the
railroad
was
going
to
waive
its
right
to
enforce
law
and
order
here
and
would
trust
to
separ
good
feeling
nothing
more
the
letter
ran
will
be
done
about
the
initial
outrage
or
the
subsequent
vandalisms
we
shall
pass
over
our
wasted
outlay
in
the
hope
that
a
policy
of
friendship
will
prove
our
genuine
desire
to
benefit
that
section
outrage
quoted
one
of
the
agent
large
playmates
they
furgivin
well
said
i
you
would
have
some
name
for
it
yourself
if
you
sent
a
deputy
sheriff
to
look
after
your
rights
and
he
came
back
tied
to
the
the
man
smiled
luxuriously
over
this
memory
we
did
hurt
him
none
just
returned
him
to
his
home
hear
about
the
label
honey
wiggin
pinned
on
to
him
us
along
one
dozen
as
per
sample
honey
quaint
yes
he
drawled
judicially
i
be
mad
at
that
but
if
you
making
peace
with
a
man
because
it
convenient
why
your
words
must
be
pleasanter
than
if
you
really
felt
he
took
the
paper
from
me
and
read
sardonically
vandalisms
wasted
outlay
i
suppose
they
run
this
station
from
charity
to
the
cattle
saves
the
poor
things
walking
so
far
to
the
other
railroad
of
friendship
genuine
desire
oh
and
shaking
his
bold
clever
head
he
daintily
flattened
the
letter
upon
the
head
of
the
agent
tubercle
said
he
this
was
their
name
for
the
agent
who
had
told
all
of
us
about
his
lungs
it
ai
your
fault
we
saw
their
fine
letter
they
just
intended
you
should
give
it
out
how
they
bother
us
any
more
and
then
we
act
square
the
boys
sit
up
late
over
this
then
they
tramped
to
their
horses
and
rode
away
the
spokesman
had
hit
the
vital
point
unerringly
for
are
shrewdly
alive
to
frankness
and
it
often
draws
out
the
best
that
is
in
them
but
its
opposite
affects
them
unfavorably
and
i
needing
sleep
sighed
to
think
of
their
late
sitting
up
over
that
joke
i
walked
to
the
board
box
painted
hotel
brunswick
hotel
in
small
italics
and
brunswick
in
enormous
capitals
the
n
and
the
s
wrong
side
up
here
sat
a
girl
outside
the
door
alone
her
face
was
broad
wholesome
and
strong
and
her
eyes
alert
and
sweet
as
i
came
she
met
me
with
a
challenging
glance
of
those
women
who
journeyed
along
the
line
in
the
wake
of
payday
to
traffic
with
the
men
employed
a
stare
well
known
but
this
straight
look
seemed
like
the
greeting
of
some
pleasant
young
cowboy
in
surprise
i
forgot
to
be
civil
and
stepped
foolishly
by
her
to
see
about
supper
and
lodging
at
the
threshold
i
perceived
all
lodging
bespoken
on
each
of
the
four
beds
lay
a
coat
or
pistol
or
other
article
of
dress
and
i
must
lodge
myself
there
were
my
rather
wet
or
lin
mclean
might
ride
in
on
his
way
to
riverside
or
perhaps
down
at
the
corrals
i
could
find
some
other
acquaintance
whose
habit
of
washing
i
trusted
and
whose
bed
i
might
share
failing
these
expedients
several
empties
stood
idle
upon
a
siding
and
the
darkness
of
these
was
timely
nights
were
short
now
camping
out
the
dawn
by
three
would
flow
like
silver
through
the
universe
and
sinking
through
my
blankets
remorselessly
pervade
my
buried
hair
and
brain
but
with
clean
straw
in
the
bottom
of
an
empty
i
could
sleep
my
fill
until
five
or
six
i
decided
for
the
empty
and
opened
the
door
where
the
table
was
set
for
more
than
enough
to
include
me
but
the
smell
of
the
butter
that
awaited
us
drove
me
out
of
the
hotel
brunswick
to
spend
the
remaining
minutes
in
the
air
i
was
expecting
you
said
the
girl
well
if
i
have
frightened
him
she
laughed
so
delightfully
that
i
recovered
and
laughed
too
why
she
explained
i
just
knew
you
not
stay
in
there
which
side
are
you
going
to
butter
your
bread
this
evening
you
had
smelt
it
said
i
still
cloudy
with
surprise
yes
unquestionably
very
she
glanced
oddly
at
me
and
with
less
fellowship
in
her
tone
said
i
was
going
to
warn
you
when
suddenly
down
at
the
corrals
the
boys
began
to
shoot
at
large
oh
dear
she
cried
starting
up
there
not
trouble
i
assured
her
too
many
are
firing
at
once
to
be
in
earnest
and
you
would
be
safe
me
a
lady
without
escort
well
i
should
reckon
so
leastways
we
are
respected
where
i
was
raised
i
was
anxious
for
the
gentlemen

and
nashville
spoke
creamily
of

that
way
i
exclaimed
is
it
awful
said
she
tilting
her
head
with
a
laugh
and
showing
the
pistol
she
carried
but
we
always
been
awful
in
kentucky
now
i
suppose
new
york
would
never
speak
to
poor
me
as
it
passed
by
and
she
eyed
me
with
capable
satire
why
new
york
i
demanded
guess
well
she
debated
well
cowboy
clothes
and
city
language
english
she
burst
out
and
then
she
turned
suddenly
red
and
whispered
to
herself
reprovingly
if
i
not
acting
rude
oh
said
i
rather
familiarly
it
was
sir
and
please
to
excuse
me
if
you
had
started
joking
so
free
with
me
i
have
been
insulted
when
i
saw
you
the
hat
and
everything
i
took
you
you
see
i
always
been
that
used
to
talking
to
to
folks
around
her
bright
face
saddened
memories
evidently
rose
before
her
and
her
eyes
grew
distant
i
wished
to
say
treat
me
as
around
but
this
tall
country
girl
had
put
us
on
other
terms
on
discovering
i
was
not
folks
around
she
had
taken
refuge
in
deriding
me
but
swiftly
feeling
no
solid
ground
there
she
drew
a
firm
clear
woman
line
between
us
plainly
she
was
a
comrade
of
men
in
her
buoyant
innocence
secure
yet
by
no
means
in
the
dark
as
to
them
yes
unescorted
two
thousand
miles
she
resumed
and
never
as
far
as
twenty
from
home
till
last
tuesday
i
expect
you
have
to
be
scandalized
for
i
do
it
right
over
again
you
got
me
all
wrong
said
i
i
not
english
i
not
new
york
i
am
good
american
and
not
bounded
by
my
own
farm
either
no
sectional
line
or
mason
and
dixon
or
missouri
river
tattoos
me
but
you
when
you
say
united
states
you
mean
united
kentucky
did
you
ever
said
she
staring
at
what
was
greek
to
her
as
it
is
to
most
americans
and
so
if
you
had
a
sister
back
east
and
she
and
you
were
all
there
was
of
you
any
more
and
she
had
seen
you
since
not
since
you
first
took
to
staying
out
nights
and
she
started
to
visit
you
you
not
tell
her
for
shame
i
travel
my
money
length
to
meet
her
said
i
a
wave
of
pain
crossed
her
face
nate
did
know
she
said
then
lightly
you
see
nate
only
a
boy
and
regular
thoughtless
about
ah
so
this
nate
never
wrote
and
his
sister
loved
and
championed
him
many
such
stray
nates
and
bobs
and
bills
galloped
over
wyoming
lost
and
forgiven
i
starting
for
him
in
the
buffalo
stage
continued
the
girl
then
i
have
your
company
on
a
weary
road
said
i
for
my
journey
was
now
to
that
part
of
the
cattle
country
to
buffalo
she
said
quickly
then
maybe
you
maybe
my
brother
is
nate
she
paused
then
you
not
acquainted
with
him
i
may
have
seen
him
i
answered
slowly
but
faces
and
names
out
here
come
and
i
knew
him
well
enough
he
was
in
jail
convicted
of
forgery
last
week
waiting
to
go
to
the
penitentiary
for
five
years
and
even
this
wild
border
community
that
hated
law
courts
and
punishments
had
not
been
sorry
for
he
had
cheated
his
friends
too
often
and
the
wide
charity
of
the
does
not
cover
that
sin
beneath
his
pretty
looks
and
daring
skill
with
horses
they
had
found
vanity
and
a
cold
false
heart
but
his
sister
could
not
here
she
was
come
to
find
him
after
lonely
years
and
to
this
one
soul
that
loved
him
in
the
world
how
was
i
to
tell
the
desolation
and
the
disgrace
i
was
glad
to
hear
her
ask
me
if
the
stage
went
soon
after
supper
now
is
that
a
bother
said
she
when
i
answered
that
it
did
not
start
till
morning
she
glanced
with
rueful
gayety
at
the
hotel
never
mind
she
continued
briskly
i
used
to
things
i
just
sit
up
somewhere
maybe
the
agent
will
let
me
stay
in
the
office
you
sure
all
that
shooting
only
jollification
certain
i
said
but
i
go
and
they
always
will
have
their
fun
said
she
but
i
hate
to
have
a
poor
boy
get
hurt
even
him
deserving
it
they
use
pistols
instead
of
said
i
but
you
must
never
sleep
in
that
office
i
see
what
we
can
why
you
real
kind
she
exclaimed
heartily
and
i
departed
wondering
what
i
ought
to
do
perhaps
i
should
have
told
you
before
that
separ
was
a
place
once
a
sort
of
place
but
you
will
relish
now
i
am
convinced
the
pithy
fable
of
its
name
midway
between
two
sections
of
this
still
unfinished
line
that
rail
after
rail
and
mile
upon
mile
crawled
over
the
earth
face
visibly
during
the
constructing
hours
of
each
new
day
lay
a
camp
to
this
point
these
unjoined
pieces
were
heading
and
here
at
length
they
met
camp
separation
it
had
been
fitly
called
but
how
should
the
american
railway
man
afford
time
to
say
that
separation
was
pretty
and
apt
but
needless
and
with
the
sloughing
of
two
syllables
came
the
brief
businesslike
result
separ
chicago
miles
it
was
labelled
on
a
board
large
almost
as
the
hut
station
a
two
sidings
the
fat
and
and
a
with
three
trees
before
it
composed
the
north
side
south
of
the
track
were
no
trees
there
was
one
long
siding
by
the
corrals
and
there
were
a
hovel
where
plug
tobacco
and
canned
goods
were
for
sale
a
shed
where
you
might
get
your
horse
shod
a
wire
fence
that
at
shipping
times
enclosed
bales
of
pressed
hay
the
hotel
the
stage
stable
and
the
little
station
some
seven
shanties
all
told
between
them
were
spaces
of
dust
the
immediate
plains
engulfed
them
and
through
their
midst
ran
the
railroad
to
which
they
hung
like
beads
on
a
great
string
from
horizon
to
horizon
a
great
string
one
end
in
the
rosy
sun
at
morning
and
one
in
the
crimson
sun
at
night
beyond
each
lay
cities
and
ports
where
the
world
went
on
out
of
sight
and
hearing
this
lone
steel
thread
had
been
stretched
across
the
continent
because
it
was
the
day
of
haste
and
hope
when
dollars
seemed
many
and
hard
times
were
few
and
from
the
yellowstone
to
the
rio
grande
similar
threads
were
stretching
and
little
separs
by
dispersed
hundreds
hung
on
them
as
it
were
in
space
eternal
can
you
wonder
that
vigorous
young
men
with
pistols
should
when
they
came
to
such
a
place
shoot
them
off
to
let
loose
their
unbounded
joy
of
living
and
yet
it
was
not
this
merely
that
began
the
custom
but
an
error
of
the
agent
the
new
station
was
scarce
created
when
one
morning
honey
wiggin
with
the
virginian
had
galloped
innocently
in
from
the
to
telegraph
for
some
additional
cars
i
dead
on
to
you
squealed
the
official
dropping
flat
at
the
sight
of
them
and
bang
went
his
gun
at
them
they
most
naturally
thought
it
was
a
maniac
and
ran
for
their
lives
among
the
supports
of
the
while
he
remained
anchored
with
his
weapon
crouched
behind
the
railing
that
fenced
him
and
his
apparatus
from
the
laity
and
some
fifteen
strategic
minutes
passed
before
all
parties
had
crawled
forth
to
an
understanding
and
the
message
was
written
and
paid
for
and
comfortably
despatched
the
agent
was
an
honest
creature
but
of
tame
habits
sent
for
the
sake
of
his
imperfect
lungs
to
this
otherwise
inappropriate
air
he
had
lived
chiefly
in
towns
a
serious
reader
of
our
comic
weeklies
hence
the
apparition
of
wiggin
and
the
virginian
had
reminded
him
sickeningly
of
bandits
he
had
express
money
in
the
safe
he
explained
to
them
and
this
was
a
hard
old
country
was
it
and
did
they
like
good
whiskey
they
drank
his
whiskey
but
it
was
not
well
to
have
mentioned
that
about
the
bandits
both
were
aware
that
when
shaved
and
washed
of
their
grime
they
could
look
very
engaging
the
two
rode
out
not
angry
but
grieved
that
a
man
come
here
to
dwell
among
them
should
be
so
tactless
if
we
do
get
him
used
to
us
observed
the
virginian
he
and
his
will
be
guttin
some
blameless
forthwith
the
cattle
country
proceeded
to
get
the
agent
used
to
it
the
news
went
over
the
from
belle
fourche
to
sweetwater
and
playful
howling
horsemen
made
it
their
custom
to
go
rioting
with
pistols
round
the
ticket
office
educating
the
agent
his
lungs
improved
and
he
came
dimly
to
smile
at
this
life
which
he
did
not
understand
but
the
company
discerned
no
humor
whatever
in
having
its
perforated
which
happened
twice
and
sheriffs
and
deputies
and
other
symptoms
of
authority
began
to
invest
separ
now
what
should
authority
do
upon
these
free
plains
this
wilderness
of
where
mere
breathing
the
air
was
like
inebriation
the
large
headlong
children
who
swept
in
from
the
and
out
again
meant
nothing
that
they
called
harm
until
they
found
themselves
resisted
then
presently
happened
that
affair
of
the
and
later
a
marshal
come
about
a
they
had
and
held
with
fiddles
drink
and
petticoats
met
his
death
accidentally
at
which
they
were
sincerely
sorry
for
about
five
minutes
they
valued
their
own
lives
as
little
and
that
lifts
them
forever
from
baseness
at
least
so
the
company
concluding
such
things
must
be
endured
for
a
while
yet
wrote
their
letter
and
you
have
seen
how
wrong
the
letter
went
all
it
would
do
would
be
from
now
on
to
fasten
upon
separ
its
code
of
recklessness
to
make
shooting
the
for
example
part
of
a
gentleman
deportment
when
he
showed
himself
in
town
it
was
not
now
the
season
of
heavy
shipping
their
work
would
be
early
finished
and
then
they
were
likely
to
play
after
their
manner
to
arrive
in
such
a
place
on
her
way
to
her
brother
the
felon
in
jail
made
the
girl
journey
seem
doubly
forlorn
to
me
as
i
wandered
down
to
the
corrals
a
small
bold
voice
hailed
me
hello
you
it
said
and
here
was
billy
lusk
aged
nine
in
boots
and
overalls
importantly
useless
with
a
stick
helping
the
men
prod
the
steers
at
the
chute
thought
you
were
at
school
said
i
ah
school
quit
returned
billy
and
changed
the
subject
say
lin
hunting
you
he
angling
to
eat
at
the
hotel
i
grubbing
with
the
and
billy
resumed
his
specious
activity
mclean
was
in
the
where
the
newspaper
had
transiently
reminded
him
of
politics
wall
street
he
was
explaining
to
the
agent
has
been
lunched
on
by
them
and
they
moving
on
feeding
along
to
chicago
we
want
here
he
noticed
me
and
dragging
his
gauntlet
off
shook
my
hand
with
his
lusty
grasp
your
eldest
son
just
said
you
were
in
haste
to
find
me
i
remarked
lose
you
he
meant
the
kid
gets
his
words
did
know
you
were
a
father
mclean
simpered
the
agent
lin
fixed
his
eye
on
the
man
and
you
do
know
it
now
said
he
then
he
removed
his
eye
let
grub
he
added
to
me
my
friend
did
not
walk
to
the
hotel
but
slowly
round
and
about
with
a
face
overcast
billy
is
a
good
kid
he
said
at
length
and
stopping
began
to
kick
small
mounds
in
the
dust
politics
floated
lightly
over
him
but
here
was
a
matter
dwelling
with
him
heavy
and
real
he
dead
stuck
on
being
a
he
presently
said
some
day
i
began
he
do
want
to
wait
that
long
lin
said
and
smiled
affectionately
and
anyhow
what
is
day
some
day
we
punchers
will
not
be
here
the
living
will
be
scattered
and
the
dead
well
they
be
all
right
have
yu
studied
the
wire
fence
it
spreading
to
catch
us
like
nets
do
the
salmon
in
the
columbia
river
no
more
salmon
no
more
stated
mclean
sententiously
and
his
words
made
me
sad
though
i
know
that
progress
can
not
spare
land
and
water
for
such
things
but
billy
lin
resumed
has
agreed
to
school
again
when
it
starts
up
in
the
fall
he
takes
his
medicine
because
i
want
him
affection
crept
anew
over
the
face
he
can
learn
books
with
the
quickest
when
he
wants
that
bear
creek
says
but
he
ought
to
have
a
regular
mother
till
till
i
can
do
for
him
yu
know
it
onwholesome
him
seeing
and
hearing
the
boys
and
me
and
me
when
i
forget
but
shucks
how
can
i
fix
it
billy
was
sure
enough
dropped
and
deserted
but
when
i
found
him
the
little
calf
could
run
and
notice
like
everything
i
should
hate
your
contract
lin
said
i
adopting
a
business
even
when
a
man
has
a
i
fill
the
contract
you
bet
i
wish
the
little
was
mine
i
a
heap
more
natural
to
him
than
that
pair
of
drunkards
that
got
him
he
likes
me
i
think
he
does
i
had
to
lick
him
now
and
then
but
lord
his
badness
is
all
right
not
sneaky
i
take
him
hunting
next
month
and
then
the
foreman
wife
at
sunk
creek
boards
him
till
school
only
when
they
move
judge
henry
make
his
virginia
man
foreman
and
he
got
no
woman
to
look
after
billy
yu
he
asking
one
hard
enough
said
i
digressing
oh
yes
asking
talk
of
adopting
said
mclean
and
his
hazel
eyes
looked
away
as
he
coughed
uneasily
then
abruptly
looking
at
me
again
he
said
do
you
get
off
any
more
truck
about
eldest
son
and
that
will
yu
friend
the
boys
are
joshing
me
now
not
that
i
care
for
what
might
easy
enough
be
so
but
there
billy
maybe
not
mind
but
maybe
he
would
after
a
while
and
i
am
kind
o
set
on
well
he
did
have
a
good
time
till
he
shook
that
home
of
his
and
i
going
to
make
this
old
bitch
of
a
world
pay
him
what
she
owes
him
if
i
can
now
you
drop
joshing
wo
yu
his
forehead
was
moist
over
getting
the
thing
said
and
laying
bare
so
much
of
his
soul
and
so
the
world
owes
us
a
good
time
lin
said
i
he
laughed
shortly
she
must
have
been
dead
broke
then
quite
a
while
you
bet
oh
no
maybe
i
used
to
travel
on
that
basis
but
see
here
lin
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
if
you
ca
expect
a
good
time
for
yourself
in
reason
you
can
sure
make
the
kids
happy
out
o
reason
ca
yu
i
fairly
opened
my
mouth
at
him
oh
yes
he
said
laughing
in
that
short
way
again
and
he
took
his
hand
off
my
shoulder
i
been
thinking
a
wonderful
lot
since
we
met
last
i
guess
i
know
some
things
yu
have
got
to
yet
yourself
why
there
a
girl
that
there
is
said
i
and
certainly
the
world
owes
her
a
better
she
a
interrupted
mclean
paying
me
no
further
attention
here
the
decrepit
proprietor
of
the
hotel
brunswick
stuck
his
beard
out
of
the
door
and
uttered
supper
with
a
shrill
croak
at
which
the
girl
rose
come
said
lin
let
hurry
but
i
hooked
my
fingers
in
his
belt
and
in
spite
of
his
plaintive
oaths
at
my
losing
him
the
best
seat
at
the
table
told
him
in
three
words
the
sister
devoted
journey
nate
buckner
he
exclaimed
him
with
a
decent
sister
it
the
other
way
round
said
i
her
with
him
for
a
brother
he
goes
to
the
penitentiary
this
week
said
lin
he
had
no
more
cash
to
stake
his
lawyer
with
and
the
lawyer
lost
interest
in
him
so
his
sister
could
have
waited
for
her
convict
away
back
at
joliet
and
saved
time
and
money
how
did
she
act
when
yu
told
her
i
not
told
not
too
kind
o
not
your
business
well
well
you
ought
to
know
better
me
only
it
do
seem
right
to
let
her
no
sir
it
not
right
either
put
it
her
brother
was
dead
and
miss
fligg
husband
would
like
dearly
to
make
him
dead
you
not
let
her
come
slap
up
against
the
news
unwarned
you
would
tell
her
he
was
sick
and
start
her
death
different
said
i
shucks
and
she
to
find
him
caged
and
waiting
for
stripes
and
a
shaved
head
how
d
yu
know
she
might
hate
that
worse
if
been
just
shot
like
a
man
in
a
husband
scrape
instead
of
jailed
like
a
skunk
for
thieving
no
sir
she
must
think
of
how
it
be
quick
as
the
stage
pulls
up
front
o
the
buffalo
plump
she
be
down
ahead
of
the
inquiring
after
her
brother
and
all
that
crowd
around
staring
why
we
ca
let
her
do
that
she
ca
do
that
if
you
do
feel
so
interfering
i
good
for
this
job
and
mclean
took
the
lead
and
marched
jingling
in
to
supper
the
seat
he
had
coveted
was
vacant
on
either
side
the
girl
were
empty
chairs
two
or
three
for
with
that
clean
shy
respect
of
the
frontier
that
divines
and
evades
a
good
woman
the
dusty
company
had
sat
itself
at
a
distance
and
mclean
best
seat
was
open
to
him
yet
he
had
veered
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
his
usually
roving
eye
attempted
no
gallantry
he
ate
sedately
and
it
was
not
until
after
long
weeks
and
many
happenings
that
miss
buckner
told
lin
she
had
known
he
was
looking
at
her
through
the
whole
of
this
meal
the
proprietor
came
and
went
bearing
beefsteak
hammered
flat
to
make
it
tender
the
girl
seemed
the
one
happy
person
among
us
for
supper
was
going
forward
with
the
invariable
alkali
etiquette
all
faces
brooding
and
feeding
amid
a
disheartening
silence
as
of
guilt
or
bereavement
that
springs
from
i
have
never
been
quite
sure
what
perhaps
reversion
to
the
native
animal
absorbed
in
his
meat
perhaps
a
little
from
every
uneasiness
lest
he
drink
his
coffee
wrong
or
stumble
in
the
accepted
uses
of
the
fork
indeed
a
diffident
uncleansed
youth
nearest
miss
buckner
presently
wiped
his
mouth
upon
the
cloth
and
mclean
knowing
better
than
that
eyed
him
for
this
conduct
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
the
lively
strength
of
the
butter
must
i
think
have
reached
all
in
the
room
at
any
rate
the
lad
troubled
by
eye
now
relieved
the
general
silence
by
observing
chattily
say
friends
that
butter
ai
in
no
if
it
too
rich
for
you
croaked
the
enraged
proprietor
use
the
company
continued
gravely
feeding
while
i
struggled
to
preserve
the
decorum
of
sadness
and
miss
buckner
face
was
also
unsteady
but
sternness
mantled
in
the
countenance
of
mclean
until
the
harmless
boy
embarrassed
to
pieces
offered
the
untasted
to
lin
to
me
helped
himself
and
finally
thrust
the
plate
at
the
girl
saying
in
his
texas
idiom
have
he
spoke
in
the
shell
voice
of
adolescence
and
on
butter
cracked
an
octave
up
into
the
treble
miss
buckner
was
speechless
and
could
only
shake
her
head
at
the
plate
mclean
however
thought
she
was
offended
she
would
choose
for
none
he
said
to
the
youth
with
appalling
calm
thank
yu
most
to
i
guess
fluted
poor
texas
in
a
dove
falsetto
it
would
go
slicker
rubbed
outside
than
at
this
miss
buckner
broke
from
the
table
and
fled
out
of
the
house
you
do
seem
to
know
anything
observed
mclean
what
did
you
escape
from
wind
him
up
wind
him
up
said
the
proprietor
sticking
his
head
in
from
the
kitchen
ah
what
the
matter
with
this
outfit
screamed
the
boy
furiously
ca
yu
leave
a
man
eat
ca
yu
leave
him
be
you
make
me
sick
and
he
flounced
out
with
his
young
boots
all
the
while
the
company
fed
on
unmoved
presently
one
remarked
who
hiring
him
the
outfit
said
another
a
third
corrected
i
seen
one
like
him
onced
said
the
first
taking
his
hat
from
beneath
his
chair
up
in
the
black
hills
he
was
eighteen
gosh
and
he
wandered
out
upon
his
business
one
by
one
the
others
also
silently
dispersed
upon
going
out
lin
and
i
found
the
boy
pacing
up
and
down
eagerly
in
talk
with
miss
buckner
she
had
made
friends
with
him
and
he
was
now
smoothed
down
and
deeply
absorbed
being
led
by
her
to
tell
her
about
himself
but
on
lin
approach
his
face
clouded
and
he
made
off
for
the
corrals
displaying
a
sullen
back
while
i
was
presenting
mclean
to
the
lady
overtaken
by
his
shyness
lin
was
greeting
her
with
ungainly
ceremony
when
she
began
at
once
you
excuse
me
but
i
just
had
to
have
my
that
all
right
m
said
he
do
mention
for
that
boy
you
know
i
fix
him
m
he
not
insult
yu
no
more
i
speak
to
now
please
do
why
why
you
were
every
bit
as
bad
miss
buckner
pealed
out
joyously
it
was
the
two
of
you
oh
dear
mclean
looked
crestfallen
i
had
no
i
did
go
to
why
there
was
no
harm
to
see
him
mean
so
well
and
you
mean
so
well
and
i
know
i
ought
to
behave
better
no
yu
ought
said
lin
with
sudden
ardor
and
then
in
a
voice
of
deprecation
you
think
us
plumb
you
know
enough
to
be
kind
to
folks
said
she
we
like
it
the
only
thing
makes
the
world
go
round
she
declared
with
an
emotion
that
i
had
heard
in
her
tone
once
or
twice
already
but
she
caught
herself
up
and
said
gayly
to
me
and
where
that
house
you
were
going
to
build
for
a
lone
girl
to
sleep
in
i
afraid
the
foundations
are
laid
yet
said
i
now
you
gentlemen
need
bother
about
we
have
to
m
you
ai
used
to
oh
i
am
no
tenderfoot
do
you
call
them
she
whipped
out
her
pistol
and
held
it
at
the
laughing
this
would
have
given
no
pleasure
to
me
but
over
lin
features
went
a
glow
of
delight
and
he
stood
gazing
at
the
pointed
weapon
and
the
girl
behind
it
my
he
said
at
length
almost
in
a
whisper
she
got
the
drop
on
me
i
reckon
i
be
afraid
to
shoot
that
one
of
yours
said
miss
buckner
but
this
hits
a
target
real
good
and
straight
at
fifteen
and
she
handed
it
to
him
for
inspection
he
received
it
hugely
grinning
and
turned
it
over
and
over
my
he
murmured
again
why
shucks
he
looked
at
miss
buckner
with
stark
rapture
caressing
the
polished
revolver
at
the
same
time
with
a
fond
unconscious
thumb
you
hold
it
just
as
steady
as
i
could
he
said
with
pride
and
added
insinuatingly
i
could
learn
yu
the
professional
drop
in
a
morning
this
here
is
a
little
dandy
you
not
trade
though
said
she
for
all
your
will
yu
trade
pounced
lin
wo
yu
now
mclean
i
am
afraid
you
thoughtless
how
could
a
girl
like
me
ever
hold
that
colt
steady
she
knows
the
brands
too
cried
lin
in
ecstasy
see
here
he
remarked
to
me
with
a
manner
that
smacked
of
command
we
losing
time
right
now
you
go
and
tell
the
agent
to
hustle
and
fix
his
room
up
for
a
lady
and
i
bring
her
i
found
the
agent
willing
of
course
to
sleep
on
the
floor
of
the
office
the
toy
station
was
also
his
home
the
front
compartment
held
the
ticket
and
telegraph
and
mail
and
express
chattels
and
the
railing
and
room
for
the
public
to
stand
through
a
door
you
then
passed
to
the
sitting
dining
and
sleeping
box
and
through
another
to
a
in
a
here
flourished
the
agent
and
his
lungs
and
here
the
company
strict
orders
bade
him
sleep
in
charge
so
i
helped
him
put
his
room
to
rights
but
we
need
not
have
hurried
ourselves
mclean
was
so
long
in
bringing
the
lady
that
i
went
out
and
found
him
walking
and
talking
with
her
while
fifty
yards
away
skulked
poor
texas
alone
this
boy
name
was
like
himself
of
the
somewhat
unexpected
order
being
manassas
donohoe
as
i
came
towards
the
new
friends
they
did
not
appear
to
be
joking
and
on
seeing
me
miss
buckner
said
to
lin
did
he
know
lin
hesitated
you
did
know
she
exclaimed
but
lost
her
resentment
at
once
and
continued
very
quietly
and
with
a
friendly
tone
i
reckon
you
like
to
have
to
tell
folks
bad
it
was
i
that
now
hesitated
not
to
a
strange
girl
anyway
said
she
well
now
i
have
good
news
to
tell
you
you
would
not
have
given
me
any
shock
if
you
had
said
you
knew
about
poor
nate
for
that
the
reason
of
course
those
things
ca
be
secrets
why
he
only
twenty
sir
how
should
he
know
about
this
world
he
had
learned
the
first
little
thing
when
he
left
home
five
years
ago
and
i
am
old
enough
to
be
grandmother
he
that
young
and
thoughtless
he
could
ever
realize
bad
companions
when
they
came
around
see
that
she
showed
me
a
paper
taking
it
out
like
a
precious
thing
as
indeed
it
was
for
it
was
a
pardon
signed
by
governor
barker
and
the
governor
has
let
me
carry
it
to
nate
myself
he
wo
know
a
thing
about
it
till
i
tell
him
the
governor
was
real
kind
and
we
will
never
forget
him
i
reckon
nate
must
have
a
mustache
by
now
said
she
to
lin
yes
lin
answered
gruffly
looking
away
from
her
he
has
got
a
mustache
all
he
be
glad
to
see
you
said
i
for
something
to
say
of
course
he
will
how
many
hours
did
you
say
we
will
be
she
asked
lin
turning
from
me
again
for
mclean
had
not
been
losing
time
it
was
plain
that
between
these
two
had
arisen
a
freemasonry
from
which
i
was
already
shut
out
her
woman
heart
had
answered
his
right
impulse
to
tell
her
about
her
brother
and
i
had
been
found
wanting
so
now
she
listened
over
again
to
the
hours
of
stage
jolting
that
we
had
before
us
and
that
lay
between
her
and
nate
we
would
be
four
herself
lin
myself
and
the
boy
was
billy
the
one
at
supper
oh
no
just
billy
lusk
of
laramie
he
a
kid
i
taking
up
the
country
lin
explained
ai
you
most
tuckered
out
oh
me
she
confessed
with
a
laugh
and
a
sigh
there
again
she
had
put
aside
my
solicitude
lightly
but
was
willing
lin
should
know
her
fatigue
yet
fatigue
and
all
she
would
not
sleep
in
the
agent
room
at
sight
of
it
and
the
close
quarters
she
drew
back
into
the
outer
office
so
prompted
by
that
inner
unsuspected
strictness
she
had
shown
me
before
come
out
she
cried
laughing
indeed
i
thank
you
but
i
ca
have
you
sleep
on
this
hard
floor
out
here
no
politeness
now
thank
you
ever
so
much
i
used
to
roughing
it
pretty
near
as
well
as
if
i
was
a
cowboy
and
she
glanced
at
lin
they
calling
she
added
to
the
agent
that
me
he
said
coming
out
to
the
telegraph
instrument
so
one
of
us
i
did
know
meant
separ
said
i
how
in
the
world
do
you
know
that
i
did
i
heard
start
and
go
right
along
so
i
guessed
they
wanted
him
and
he
could
hear
them
from
his
can
yu
do
astronomy
and
spanish
too
inquired
the
proud
and
smiling
mclean
why
it
nothing
i
been
day
operator
back
home
why
is
a
deputy
coming
through
on
a
special
engine
please
do
say
it
out
loud
quavered
the
agent
as
the
machine
clicked
its
news
yu
need
be
scared
of
a
girl
said
lin
another
sheriff
so
they
not
quit
bothering
us
however
this
meddling
was
not
the
company
but
the
county
a
sheriff
sent
to
arrest
on
a
charge
of
murder
a
man
named
trampas
said
to
be
at
the
sand
hill
ranch
that
was
near
rawhide
two
stations
beyond
and
the
engine
might
not
stop
at
separ
even
to
water
so
here
was
no
molesting
of
separ
liberties
all
the
same
lin
said
for
pistols
now
and
then
still
sounded
at
the
corrals
the
boys
not
understand
that
till
it
explained
and
they
may
act
wayward
first
i
feel
easier
if
you
slept
here
he
urged
to
the
girl
but
she
would
not
well
then
we
must
rustle
some
other
private
place
for
you
how
the
rank
said
the
agent
since
those
italians
used
it
the
pump
engineer
has
been
scouring
but
he
scared
to
bunk
there
yet
too
bad
you
could
try
my
plan
of
a
said
i
an
empty
she
cried
is
there
a
clean
one
you
sure
never
done
that
lin
burst
out
so
you
scandalized
said
she
punishing
him
instantly
i
reckon
it
does
take
a
decent
girl
to
shock
and
while
she
stood
laughing
at
him
with
robust
irony
poor
lin
began
to
stammer
that
he
meant
no
offence
why
to
be
sure
you
did
said
she
but
i
do
enjoy
you
real
well
m
protested
the
wincing
driven
back
to
addressing
her
as
we
ai
used
do
tangle
yourself
up
worse
mclean
no
more
am
i
i
have
never
slept
in
an
empty
in
my
life
and
why
is
that
just
because
never
had
to
and
there
the
difference
between
you
boys
and
us
you
do
lots
of
things
you
do
like
and
tell
us
and
we
put
up
with
lots
of
things
we
do
like
but
we
never
let
you
find
out
i
know
you
meant
no
offense
she
continued
heartily
softening
towards
her
crushed
protector
because
you
a
gentleman
and
lands
i
not
complaining
about
an
empty
that
will
be
rich
if
i
can
have
the
door
upon
this
she
went
out
to
view
the
cars
mclean
hovering
behind
her
with
a
devoted
uneasy
countenance
and
frequently
muttering
shucks
while
the
agent
and
i
followed
with
a
lamp
for
the
dark
was
come
with
our
help
she
mounted
into
the
first
car
and
then
into
the
next
taking
the
lamp
and
while
she
scanned
the
floor
and
corners
and
slid
the
door
back
and
forth
lin
whispered
in
my
ear
her
name
jessamine
she
told
me
do
yu
like
that
name
so
i
answered
him
yes
very
much
thinking
that
some
larger
flower
but
still
a
flower
might
have
been
more
apt
nobody
seems
to
have
slept
in
these
said
she
stepping
down
and
on
learning
that
even
the
tramp
avoided
separ
when
he
could
she
exclaimed
what
lodging
could
be
handier
than
this
only
it
would
be
so
cute
if
you
had
a
louavull
an
nashvull
car
said
she
twould
seem
like
my
old
kentucky
home
and
laughing
rather
sweetly
at
her
joke
she
held
the
lamp
up
to
read
the
car
lettering
and
oh
a
stranger
i
reckon
they
all
she
went
along
the
train
with
her
lamp
yes
and
and
and
oh
this
is
rich
nate
will
laugh
when
he
hears
i
choose
and
q
a
little
nearer
my
country
what
time
does
the
stage
start
porter
please
wake
and
q
at
six
sharp
said
she
to
lin
from
this
point
of
the
evening
on
i
think
of
our
doings
their
doings
with
a
sort
of
unchanging
homesickness
nothing
like
them
can
ever
happen
again
i
know
for
it
all
gone
settled
sobered
and
gone
and
whatever
wholesomer
prose
of
good
fortune
waits
in
our
cup
how
i
thank
my
luck
for
this
swallow
of
frontier
poetry
which
i
came
in
time
for
to
arrange
some
sort
of
bed
for
her
was
the
next
thing
and
we
made
a
good
clean
straw
and
blankets
and
a
pillow
and
the
agent
would
have
brought
sheets
but
though
she
would
not
have
these
she
did
not
resist
what
do
you
suppose
a
for
next
morning
and
we
got
a
bucket
of
water
and
her
valise
it
was
all
one
to
her
she
said
in
what
car
lin
and
i
put
up
and
let
it
be
next
door
by
all
means
if
it
pleased
him
to
think
he
could
watch
over
her
safety
better
so
and
she
shut
herself
in
bidding
us
we
began
spreading
straw
and
blankets
for
ourselves
when
a
whistle
sounded
far
and
long
and
its
tone
rose
in
pitch
as
it
came
i
get
him
to
run
right
to
the
corrals
said
the
agent
so
the
sheriff
can
tell
the
boys
he
not
after
that
convince
he
is
said
lin
stop
him
here
or
let
him
go
but
we
were
not
to
steer
the
course
that
events
took
now
the
rails
of
the
main
line
beside
us
brightened
in
wavering
parallels
as
the
headlight
grew
down
upon
us
and
in
this
same
moment
the
shootings
at
the
corrals
chorused
in
a
wild
hilarious
threat
the
burden
of
the
coming
engine
heavily
throbbed
in
the
air
and
along
the
steel
and
met
and
mixed
with
the
hard
light
beating
of
hoofs
the
sounds
approached
together
like
a
sort
of
charge
and
i
stepped
between
the
where
i
heard
lin
ordering
the
girl
inside
to
lie
down
flat
and
could
see
the
agent
running
about
in
the
dust
flapping
his
arms
to
signal
with
as
much
coherence
as
a
chicken
with
its
head
off
i
had
very
short
space
for
wonder
or
alarm
the
edge
of
one
of
my
glowed
suddenly
with
the
imminent
headlight
and
galloping
shots
invaded
the
place
the
horsemen
flew
by
overreaching
and
leaning
back
and
lugging
against
their
impetus
they
passed
in
a
tangled
swirl
and
their
dust
coiled
up
thick
from
the
dark
ground
and
luminously
unfolded
across
the
glare
of
the
locomotive
then
they
wheeled
and
clustered
around
it
where
it
stood
by
our
cars
its
pumping
deep
breaths
and
the
internal
steam
humming
through
its
bowels
and
i
came
out
in
time
to
see
billy
lusk
climb
its
front
with
callow
enterprising
shouts
that
was
child
play
and
the
universal
yell
now
raised
by
the
horsemen
was
their
child
play
too
but
the
whole
thing
could
so
precipitately
reel
into
the
fatal
that
my
thoughts
stopped
i
could
only
look
when
i
saw
that
they
had
somehow
recognized
the
man
on
the
engine
for
a
sheriff
two
had
sprung
from
their
horses
and
were
making
boisterously
toward
the
cab
while
lin
mclean
neither
boisterous
nor
joking
was
going
to
the
cab
from
my
side
with
his
pistol
drawn
to
keep
the
peace
the
engineer
sat
with
a
neutral
hand
on
the
lever
the
fireman
had
run
along
the
top
of
the
coal
in
the
tender
and
descended
and
crouched
somewhere
and
the
sheriff
cool
and
with
a
eye
upon
all
parties
was
just
beginning
to
explain
his
errand
when
some
rider
from
the
crowd
cut
him
short
with
an
invitation
to
get
down
and
have
a
drink
at
the
word
of
ribald
endearment
by
which
he
named
the
sheriff
a
passing
fierceness
hardened
the
officer
face
and
the
new
yell
they
gave
was
less
playful
waiting
no
more
explanations
they
swarmed
against
the
locomotive
and
mclean
pulled
himself
up
on
the
step
the
loud
talking
fell
at
a
stroke
to
let
business
go
on
and
in
this
silence
came
the
noise
of
a
at
that
i
looked
and
they
all
looked
and
stood
harmless
like
children
surprised
for
there
on
the
threshold
of
the
with
the
interior
darkness
behind
her
and
touched
by
the
headlight
diverging
rays
stood
jessamine
buckner
will
you
gentlemen
do
me
a
favor
said
she
strangers
maybe
have
no
right
to
ask
favors
but
i
reckon
you
let
that
pass
this
time
for
i
real
sleepy
she
smiled
as
she
brought
this
out
i
been
four
days
and
nights
on
the
cars
and
i
got
to
stage
to
buffalo
you
see
i
not
be
here
to
spoil
your
fun
night
and
i
want
boys
to
be
boys
just
as
much
as
ever
they
can
wo
you
put
it
off
till
night
in
their
amazement
they
found
no
spokesman
but
i
saw
lin
busy
among
them
and
that
some
word
was
passing
through
their
groups
after
the
brief
interval
of
they
began
silently
to
get
on
their
horses
while
the
looming
engine
glowed
and
pumped
its
breath
and
the
sheriff
and
engineer
remained
as
they
were
lady
said
a
voice
among
the
moving
horsemen
but
the
others
kept
their
abashed
native
silence
and
thus
they
slowly
filed
away
to
the
corrals
the
figures
in
their
loose
shirts
and
leathern
chaps
passed
from
the
dimness
for
a
moment
through
the
cone
of
light
in
front
of
the
locomotive
so
that
the
metal
about
them
made
here
and
there
a
faint
vanishing
glint
and
here
and
there
in
the
departing
column
a
bold
face
turned
for
a
look
at
the
girl
in
the
doorway
and
then
was
gone
again
into
the
dimness
the
sheriff
in
the
cab
took
off
his
hat
to
miss
buckner
remarking
that
she
should
belong
to
the
force
and
as
the
bell
rang
and
the
engine
moved
off
popped
young
billy
lusk
from
his
with
an
exclamation
of
horror
she
sprang
down
and
mclean
appeared
and
with
all
a
parent
fright
and
rage
held
the
boy
by
the
arm
grotesquely
as
the
sheriff
steamed
by
i
ai
to
chase
it
said
young
billy
struggling
i
a
mind
to
cowhide
you
said
lin
but
miss
buckner
interposed
oh
well
said
she
next
time
if
he
does
it
next
time
it
so
late
you
not
frighten
us
that
way
again
if
he
lets
you
off
she
asked
billy
no
said
billy
looking
at
her
with
interest
father
have
cowhided
me
anyway
i
guess
he
added
meditatively
do
you
call
him
father
ah
father
at
laramie
said
billy
with
disgust
he
not
stop
for
your
asking
lin
do
bother
me
you
quit
talking
and
step
up
there
ordered
his
guardian
well
m
i
guess
yu
can
sleep
good
now
in
if
it
was
only
an
and
i
not
have
a
thing
against
it
mclean
young
i
billy
lusk
i
can
ride
chalkeye
pinto
that
bucked
honey
i
am
sure
you
can
ride
finely
lusk
maybe
you
and
i
can
take
a
ride
together
pleasant
dreams
she
nodded
and
smiled
to
him
and
slid
her
door
to
and
billy
considered
it
remarking
i
like
her
what
makes
her
live
in
a
car
but
he
was
drowsing
while
i
told
him
and
i
lifted
him
up
to
lin
who
took
him
in
his
own
blankets
where
he
fell
immediately
asleep
one
distant
whistle
showed
how
far
the
late
engine
had
gone
from
us
we
left
our
car
open
and
i
lay
enjoying
the
cool
air
thus
was
i
drifting
off
when
i
grew
aware
of
a
figure
in
the
door
it
was
lin
standing
in
his
stockings
and
not
much
else
with
his
pistol
he
listened
and
then
leaped
down
light
as
a
cat
i
heard
some
repressed
talking
and
lay
in
expectancy
but
back
he
came
noiseless
in
his
stockings
and
as
he
slid
into
bed
i
asked
what
the
matter
was
he
had
found
the
texas
boy
manassas
donohoe
by
the
girl
car
with
no
worse
intention
than
keeping
a
watch
on
it
so
i
gave
him
to
understand
said
lin
that
i
had
no
objection
to
him
amusing
himself
playing
but
that
i
guessed
i
was
enough
guard
and
he
would
find
sleep
healthier
for
his
after
this
i
went
to
sleep
wholly
but
waking
once
in
the
night
thought
i
heard
some
one
outside
and
learned
in
the
morning
from
lin
that
the
boy
had
not
gone
until
the
time
came
for
him
to
join
his
outfit
at
the
corrals
and
i
was
surprised
that
lin
the
usually
should
find
nothing
but
mirth
in
the
idea
of
this
unknown
unthanked
young
sentinel
sleeping
a
heap
better
for
them
kind
till
they
get
their
growth
was
his
single
observation
but
when
separ
had
dwindled
to
toys
behind
us
in
the
journeying
stage
i
told
miss
jessamine
and
although
she
laughed
too
it
was
with
a
note
that
young
texas
would
have
liked
to
hear
and
she
hoped
she
might
see
him
upon
her
return
to
thank
him
any
jack
can
walk
around
all
night
said
mclean
disparagingly
well
then
and
i
know
a
jack
who
did
observed
the
young
lady
this
speech
caused
her
admirer
to
be
full
of
explanations
so
that
when
she
saw
how
readily
she
could
perplex
him
and
yet
how
capable
and
untiring
he
was
about
her
comfort
helping
her
out
or
tucking
her
in
at
the
stations
where
we
had
a
meal
or
changed
horses
she
enjoyed
the
hours
very
much
in
spite
of
their
growing
awkwardness
but
oh
the
sparkling
unbashful
lin
sometimes
he
sat
himself
beside
her
to
be
close
and
then
he
would
move
opposite
the
better
to
behold
her
never
except
once
long
after
when
sorrow
manfully
borne
had
still
further
refined
his
clay
have
i
heard
lin
voice
or
seen
his
look
so
winning
no
doubt
many
a
male
bird
cares
nothing
what
neighbor
bird
overhears
his
spring
song
from
the
top
of
the
open
tree
but
i
extremely
doubt
if
his
even
if
she
be
a
frank
bouncing
robin
does
not
prefer
to
listen
from
some
thicket
and
not
upon
the
public
lawn
jessamine
grew
silent
and
almost
peevish
and
from
discourse
upon
man
and
woman
she
hopped
she
skipped
she
flew
when
lin
looked
at
his
watch
and
counted
the
diminished
hours
between
her
and
buffalo
she
smiled
to
herself
but
from
mention
of
her
brother
she
shrank
glancing
swiftly
at
me
and
my
slumber
and
it
was
with
indignation
and
that
i
climbed
out
in
the
hot
sun
at
last
beside
the
driver
and
small
billy
i
know
this
road
piped
billy
on
the
box
camped
here
with
father
when
mother
was
off
that
time
you
can
take
a
trail
by
those
cottonwoods
and
strike
the
so
i
inquired
what
game
he
had
then
shot
ah
just
a
lin
to
let
me
shoot
a
bear
you
know
what
made
lin
marry
mother
when
father
was
around
the
driver
gave
me
a
look
over
billy
head
and
i
gave
him
one
and
i
instructed
billy
that
people
supposed
his
father
was
dead
i
withheld
that
his
mother
gave
herself
out
as
miss
peck
in
the
days
when
lin
met
her
on
bear
creek
the
formidable
pondered
the
geography
says
they
used
to
have
a
lot
of
wives
at
salt
lake
city
is
there
a
place
where
a
woman
can
have
a
lot
of
husbands
it
do
especially
depend
on
the
place
remarked
the
driver
to
me
because
billy
went
on
bert
taylor
told
me
in
recess
that
had
a
lot
and
i
told
him
he
lied
and
the
other
boys
they
laughed
and
i
blacked
bert
eye
on
him
and
i
have
blacked
the
others
too
only
miss
wood
came
out
i
would
tell
her
what
bert
said
and
bert
would
and
sophy
armstrong
told
her
bert
father
found
out
and
he
come
round
and
i
thought
he
was
to
lick
me
about
the
eye
and
he
licked
bert
say
am
i
lin
honest
no
billy
you
not
i
said
wish
i
was
they
could
get
me
back
to
laramie
then
but
oh
bother
i
not
go
for
i
like
to
see
try
lin
would
leave
me
go
you
ai
married
are
you
no
more
is
lin
now
i
guess
a
good
many
are
but
i
would
want
to
i
do
think
anything
of
i
seen
mother
take
stuff
on
the
sly
she
whaled
me
worse
than
lin
ever
does
i
guess
he
would
want
to
be
mother
husband
again
and
if
he
does
said
billy
his
voice
suddenly
vindictive
i
quit
him
and
no
danger
bill
said
i
how
would
the
nice
lady
inside
please
you
inquired
the
driver
ah
pshaw
she
ai
after
lin
sang
out
billy
loud
and
scornful
she
after
her
brother
she
all
right
though
he
added
approvingly
at
this
all
talk
stopped
short
inside
reviving
in
a
casual
scanty
manner
while
unconscious
billy
lusk
tired
of
the
one
subject
now
spoke
cheerfully
of
birds
eggs
who
knows
the
young
in
days
yet
old
as
adam
and
the
hills
that
slur
about
his
mother
was
as
dim
to
his
understanding
as
to
the
offender
yet
mysterious
nature
had
bid
him
go
to
instant
war
how
foreseeing
in
lin
to
choke
the
unfounded
jest
about
his
relation
to
billy
lusk
in
hopes
to
save
the
boy
ever
awakening
to
the
facts
of
his
mother
life
though
said
the
driver
an
easygoing
cynic
folks
with
lots
of
fathers
will
find
heaps
of
brothers
in
this
country
but
presently
he
let
billy
hold
the
reins
and
at
the
next
station
carefully
lifted
him
down
and
up
i
knowed
that
woman
too
he
whispered
to
me
sidney
nebraska
lusk
was
off
half
the
time
we
laughed
when
she
fooled
lin
into
marryin
her
come
to
think
he
mused
as
twilight
deepened
around
our
clanking
stage
and
small
billy
slept
sound
between
us
there
scarcely
a
thing
in
life
you
get
a
laugh
out
of
that
do
make
soberness
for
soberness
had
now
visited
the
pair
behind
us
even
lin
lively
talk
had
quieted
and
his
tones
were
low
and
few
but
though
miss
jessamine
at
our
next
change
of
horses
hoped
i
would
come
inside
i
knew
she
did
not
hope
very
earnestly
and
outside
i
remained
until
buffalo
journeying
done
her
face
revealed
the
strain
beneath
her
brave
brightness
and
the
haunting
care
she
could
no
longer
keep
from
her
eyes
the
imminence
of
the
jail
and
the
meeting
had
made
her
cheeks
white
and
her
countenance
seem
actually
smaller
and
when
reminding
me
that
we
should
meet
again
soon
she
gave
me
her
hand
it
was
i
think
she
was
afraid
lin
might
offer
to
go
with
her
but
his
heart
understood
the
lonely
sacredness
of
her
next
and
the
cow
puncher
standing
aside
for
her
to
pass
lifted
his
hat
wistfully
and
spoke
never
a
word
for
a
moment
he
looked
after
her
with
sombre
emotion
but
the
and
prison
stood
near
and
in
sight
and
as
plain
as
if
he
had
said
so
i
saw
him
suddenly
feel
she
should
not
be
stared
at
going
up
those
steps
it
must
be
all
alone
the
pain
and
the
joy
of
that
reprieve
he
turned
away
with
me
and
after
a
few
silent
steps
said
wasted
all
wasted
let
us
hope
i
began
you
not
a
fool
he
broke
in
roughly
you
do
hope
he
start
life
elsewhere
said
i
elsewhere
yes
keep
starting
till
all
the
elsewheres
know
him
like
powder
river
knows
him
but
she
i
have
had
to
sit
and
hear
her
tell
and
tell
about
him
all
about
back
in
kentucky
playin
around
the
farm
and
how
she
raised
him
after
the
old
folks
died
then
he
got
bigger
and
made
her
sell
their
farm
and
she
told
how
it
was
right
he
should
turn
it
into
money
and
get
his
half
i
did
not
dare
say
a
word
for
she
have
just
bit
my
head
off
and
and
that
would
sure
hurt
me
now
lin
brought
up
with
a
comical
chuckle
and
she
went
to
work
and
he
cleared
out
and
no
more
seen
or
heard
of
him
that
for
five
years
and
she
given
up
tracing
him
when
one
morning
she
reads
in
the
paper
about
how
her
brother
is
convicted
for
forgery
that
the
way
she
knows
he
not
dead
and
she
takes
her
savings
off
her
railroad
salary
and
starts
for
him
she
was
that
hasty
she
thought
it
was
buffalo
new
york
till
she
got
in
the
cars
and
read
the
paper
over
again
but
she
had
to
go
as
far
as
cincinnati
either
way
she
has
paid
every
cent
of
the
money
he
we
had
come
to
the
bridge
and
lin
jerked
a
stone
into
the
quick
little
river
she
awful
strict
in
some
ways
thought
buffalo
must
be
a
wicked
place
because
of
the
shops
bein
open
sunday
now
if
that
was
all
buffalo
wickedness
and
she
thinks
divorce
is
mostly
sin
but
her
heart
is
a
shield
for
her
face
is
as
beautiful
as
her
actions
he
added
well
said
i
and
would
you
make
such
a
villain
your
he
whirled
round
and
took
both
my
shoulders
come
walking
he
urged
i
must
talk
so
we
followed
the
stream
out
of
town
towards
the
mountains
i
came
awful
near
asking
her
in
the
stage
said
he
goodness
lin
give
yourself
time
time
ca
increase
my
hers
man
hers
how
many
hours
have
you
known
her
hours
and
hours
you
talking
foolishness
what
have
they
got
to
do
with
it
and
she
will
listen
to
me
i
can
tell
she
will
i
know
i
can
be
so
she
listen
and
it
will
go
all
right
for
i
ask
so
hard
and
everything
come
out
straight
yu
see
i
not
been
spending
to
speak
of
since
billy
on
my
hands
and
now
i
fix
up
my
cabin
and
finish
my
fencing
and
my
ditch
and
she
going
to
like
box
elder
creek
better
than
shawhan
she
the
first
i
ever
then
i
like
to
ask
i
cried
out
ask
away
he
exclaimed
inattentively
in
his
enthusiasm
when
you
but
i
stopped
perceiving
it
impossible
it
was
of
course
not
the
many
transient
passions
on
which
he
had
squandered
his
substance
but
the
one
where
faith
also
had
seemed
to
unite
had
he
not
married
once
innocent
of
the
woman
being
already
a
wife
but
i
stopped
for
to
trench
here
was
not
for
me
or
any
one
and
my
pause
strangely
flashed
on
him
something
of
that
i
had
in
my
mind
no
he
said
his
eyes
steady
and
serious
upon
me
do
you
ask
about
the
things
you
then
his
face
grew
radiant
and
rather
stern
do
you
suppose
i
do
know
she
too
good
for
me
and
that
some
bygones
ca
ever
be
bygones
but
if
you
he
said
never
come
to
look
away
up
to
a
woman
from
away
down
and
mean
to
win
her
just
the
same
as
if
you
did
deserve
her
why
you
make
a
turruble
mess
of
the
whole
business
when
we
walked
in
silence
for
a
long
while
he
lighted
again
with
the
blossoming
dawn
of
his
sentiment
i
thought
of
the
coarse
yet
taking
vagabond
of
twenty
i
had
once
chanced
upon
and
hunted
and
camped
with
since
through
the
years
decidedly
he
was
not
that
boy
it
is
not
true
that
all
of
us
rise
through
adversity
any
more
than
that
all
plants
need
shadow
some
starve
out
of
the
sunshine
and
i
have
seen
misery
deaden
once
kind
people
to
everything
but
self
almost
the
saddest
sight
in
the
world
but
lin
character
had
not
stood
well
the
ordeal
of
happiness
and
for
him
certainly
harsh
days
and
responsibility
had
been
needed
to
ripen
the
spirit
yes
jessamine
buckner
would
have
been
much
too
good
for
him
before
that
humiliation
of
his
marriage
and
this
care
of
young
billy
with
which
he
had
loaded
himself
lin
said
i
i
will
drink
your
health
and
i
healthy
enough
said
he
and
we
came
back
to
the
main
street
and
into
the
main
saloon
how
d
boys
said
some
one
and
there
was
nate
buckner
it
on
me
he
continued
shoving
whiskey
along
the
bar
and
i
saw
he
was
a
little
drunk
i
setting
up
he
continued
why
why
because
he
looked
around
for
appreciation
because
it
not
every
in
wyoming
gets
pardoned
by
governor
barker
i
important
i
want
you
to
understand
he
pursued
to
the
cold
bystanders
have
a
picture
of
me
in
the
cheyenne
paper
of
powder
river
they
ca
do
without
me
if
any
here
thinks
he
knows
how
to
break
a
colt
he
shouted
looking
around
with
the
irrelevant
fierceness
of
drink
and
then
his
challenge
ebbed
vacantly
in
laughter
as
the
subject
blurred
in
his
mind
you
not
drinking
lin
said
he
no
said
mclean
i
sworn
off
again
well
water
never
did
agree
with
yu
never
gave
water
the
chance
retorted
the
and
we
left
the
place
without
my
having
drunk
his
health
it
was
a
grim
beginning
this
brag
attempt
to
laugh
his
reputation
down
with
the
jail
door
scarce
closed
behind
him
folks
are
not
going
to
like
that
said
lin
as
we
walked
across
the
bridge
again
to
the
hotel
yet
the
sister
left
alone
here
after
an
hour
at
most
of
her
company
would
pretend
it
was
a
matter
of
course
nate
was
not
in
she
told
us
at
once
he
had
business
to
attend
to
and
friends
to
see
he
must
get
back
to
riverside
and
down
in
that
country
where
colts
were
waiting
for
him
he
was
the
only
one
the
outfit
would
allow
to
handle
their
young
stock
did
we
know
that
and
she
was
going
to
stay
with
a
pierce
down
there
for
a
while
near
where
nate
would
be
working
all
this
she
told
us
but
when
he
did
not
return
to
dine
with
her
on
this
first
day
i
think
she
found
it
hard
to
sustain
her
wilful
cheeriness
lin
offered
to
take
her
driving
to
see
the
military
post
and
dress
parade
at
retreat
and
cloud
peak
and
buffalo
various
sights
but
she
made
excuses
and
retired
to
her
room
nate
however
was
at
tea
shaven
clean
with
good
clothes
and
well
conducted
his
tone
and
manner
to
jessamine
were
confidential
and
caressing
and
offended
mclean
so
that
i
observed
to
him
that
it
was
scarcely
reasonable
to
be
jealous
oh
no
jealousy
said
he
but
he
comes
in
and
kisses
her
and
he
kisses
her
and
us
strangers
looking
on
it
such
oncontrollable
affection
yu
see
after
never
writing
for
five
years
i
expect
she
must
have
some
of
her
savings
it
is
true
that
the
sister
gave
the
brother
money
more
than
once
and
as
our
ways
lay
together
i
had
chances
to
see
them
both
and
to
wonder
if
her
joy
at
being
with
him
once
again
was
going
to
last
on
the
road
to
riverside
i
certainly
heard
jessamine
beg
him
to
return
home
with
her
and
he
ridiculed
such
a
notion
what
proper
life
for
a
live
man
was
that
dead
place
back
east
he
asked
her
i
thought
he
might
have
expressed
some
regret
that
they
must
dwell
so
far
apart
or
some
intention
to
visit
her
now
and
then
but
he
said
nothing
of
the
sort
though
he
spoke
volubly
of
himself
and
his
prospects
i
suppose
this
spectacle
of
brother
and
sister
had
rubbed
lin
the
wrong
way
too
much
for
he
held
himself
and
billy
aloof
joining
me
on
the
road
but
once
and
then
merely
to
give
me
the
news
that
people
here
wanted
no
more
of
nate
buckner
he
would
be
run
out
of
the
country
and
respect
for
the
sister
was
all
that
meanwhile
saved
him
but
buckner
like
so
many
spared
criminals
seemed
brazenly
unaware
he
was
disgraced
and
went
hailing
loudly
any
riders
or
drivers
we
met
while
beside
him
his
sister
sat
close
and
straight
her
stanch
affection
and
support
for
the
world
to
see
for
all
she
let
appear
she
might
have
been
bringing
him
back
from
some
gallant
heroism
achieved
and
as
i
rode
along
the
travesty
seemed
more
and
more
pitiful
the
outcome
darker
and
darker
at
all
times
is
riverside
beautiful
but
most
beautiful
when
the
sun
draws
down
through
the
openings
of
the
hills
from
each
one
a
stream
comes
flowing
clearly
out
into
the
plain
and
fields
spread
green
along
the
margins
it
was
beneath
the
radiance
of
evening
that
we
saw
blue
creek
and
felt
its
coolness
rise
among
the
shifting
veils
of
light
the
red
bluff
eastward
the
tall
natural
fortress
lost
its
stern
masonry
of
shapes
and
loomed
a
soft
towering
enchantment
of
violet
and
amber
and
saffron
in
the
changing
rays
the
cattle
stood
quiet
about
the
levels
and
horses
were
moving
among
the
restless
colts
these
the
brother
bade
his
sister
look
at
for
with
them
was
his
glory
and
i
heard
him
boasting
of
his
skill
truthful
boasting
to
be
sure
had
he
been
honest
in
his
dealings
the
that
man
courage
and
dashing
appearance
beget
in
men
would
have
brought
him
more
employment
than
he
could
have
undertaken
he
told
jessamine
his
way
of
breaking
a
horse
that
few
would
dare
and
she
listened
eagerly
do
you
remember
when
i
used
to
hold
the
pony
for
you
to
get
on
she
said
you
always
would
scare
me
nate
and
he
replied
fluently
yes
yes
did
she
see
that
horse
there
near
the
fence
he
was
a
an
outlaw
and
she
would
find
no
one
had
tried
getting
on
his
back
since
he
had
been
absent
this
was
the
first
question
he
asked
on
reaching
the
cabin
where
various
neighbors
were
waiting
the
and
finding
he
was
right
he
turned
in
pride
to
jessamine
they
do
know
how
to
handle
that
horse
said
he
i
told
you
so
give
me
a
did
she
notice
the
cold
greeting
nate
received
i
think
not
not
only
was
their
welcome
to
her
the
kinder
but
any
one
is
glad
to
witness
bold
riding
and
this
chance
made
a
stir
which
the
sister
may
have
taken
for
cordiality
but
lin
gave
me
a
look
for
it
was
the
same
here
as
it
had
been
in
the
buffalo
saloon
the
trick
is
easy
enough
said
nate
arriving
with
his
outlaw
and
liking
an
audience
you
do
want
a
bridle
but
a
rope
hackamore
like
this
spanish
style
then
let
them
run
as
hard
as
they
want
and
on
a
sudden
reach
down
your
arm
and
catch
the
hackamore
short
close
up
by
the
mouth
and
jerk
them
round
quick
and
heavy
at
full
speed
they
quit
their
fooling
after
one
or
two
doses
now
watch
your
outlaw
he
went
into
the
saddle
so
swift
and
secure
that
the
animal
amazed
trembled
then
sprang
headlong
it
stopped
vicious
and
knowing
and
plunged
in
a
rage
but
could
do
nothing
with
the
man
and
bolted
again
and
away
in
a
straight
blind
line
over
the
meadow
when
the
rider
leaned
forward
to
his
trick
the
horse
veered
in
a
jagged
swerve
rolled
over
and
over
with
its
twisted
impetus
and
up
on
its
feet
and
on
without
a
stop
the
man
still
seated
and
upright
in
the
saddle
how
we
cheered
to
see
it
but
the
figure
now
tilted
strangely
and
something
awful
and
nameless
came
over
us
and
chilled
our
noise
to
silence
the
horse
dazed
and
tamed
by
the
fall
brought
its
burden
towards
us
a
wobbling
thing
falling
by
small
shakes
backward
until
the
head
sank
on
the
horse
rump
come
away
said
lin
mclean
to
jessamine
and
at
his
voice
she
obeyed
and
went
leaning
on
his
arm
jessamine
sat
by
her
brother
until
he
died
twelve
hours
afterwards
having
spoken
and
known
nothing
the
whole
weight
of
the
horse
had
crushed
him
internally
he
must
have
become
almost
instantly
unconscious
being
held
in
the
saddle
by
his
spurs
which
had
caught
in
the
hair
cinch
it
may
be
that
our
loud
cheer
was
the
last
thing
of
this
world
that
he
knew
the
injuries
to
his
body
made
impossible
any
taking
him
home
which
his
sister
at
first
wished
to
do
why
i
came
here
to
bring
him
home
she
said
with
a
smile
and
tone
like
cheerfulness
in
wax
her
calm
the
unearthly
ease
with
which
she
spoke
to
any
comer
and
she
was
surrounded
with
rough
kindness
embarrassed
the
listeners
she
saw
her
calamity
clear
as
they
did
but
was
in
it
it
was
lin
gave
her
what
she
needed
the
repose
of
his
strong
silent
presence
he
spoke
no
sympathy
and
no
advice
nor
even
did
he
argue
with
her
about
the
burial
he
perceived
somehow
that
she
did
not
really
hear
what
was
said
to
her
and
that
these
first
griefless
sensible
words
came
from
some
mechanism
of
the
nerves
so
he
kept
himself
near
her
and
let
her
tell
her
story
as
she
would
once
i
heard
him
say
to
her
with
the
same
authority
of
that
first
come
away
now
you
had
enough
of
the
talking
come
for
a
enough
of
the
talking
as
if
it
were
a
treatment
how
did
he
think
of
that
jessamine
at
any
rate
again
obeyed
him
and
i
saw
the
two
going
quietly
about
in
the
meadows
and
along
the
curving
brook
and
that
night
she
slept
well
on
one
only
point
did
the
consult
me
they
figured
to
put
nate
on
top
of
that
bald
mound
said
he
but
she
has
talked
about
the
flowers
and
shade
where
the
old
folks
lie
and
where
she
wants
him
to
be
alongside
of
them
i
not
let
her
look
at
him
for
well
she
might
get
the
way
he
looks
now
on
her
memory
but
i
like
to
show
you
my
idea
before
going
lin
had
indeed
chosen
a
beautiful
place
and
so
i
told
him
at
the
first
sight
of
it
that
all
i
wanted
to
know
said
he
i
fix
the
i
believe
he
never
once
told
jessamine
the
body
could
not
travel
so
far
as
kentucky
i
think
he
let
her
live
and
talk
and
grieve
from
hour
to
hour
and
then
led
her
that
afternoon
to
the
nook
of
sunlight
and
sheltering
trees
and
won
her
consent
to
it
thus
for
there
was
nate
laid
and
there
she
went
to
sit
alone
lin
did
not
go
with
her
on
those
walks
but
now
something
new
was
on
the
fellow
mind
he
was
plainly
occupied
with
it
whatever
else
he
was
doing
and
he
had
some
active
on
my
asking
him
if
jessamine
buckner
had
decided
when
to
return
east
he
inquired
of
me
angrily
what
was
there
in
kentucky
she
could
not
have
in
wyoming
consequently
though
i
surmised
what
he
must
be
debating
i
felt
myself
invited
to
keep
out
of
his
confidence
and
i
did
so
my
advice
to
him
would
have
been
ill
received
and
as
was
soon
to
be
made
plain
would
have
done
his
delicacy
injustice
next
one
morning
he
and
billy
were
gone
my
first
thought
was
that
he
had
rejoined
jessamine
at
pierce
where
she
was
and
left
me
away
over
here
on
bear
creek
where
we
had
come
for
part
of
a
week
but
stuck
in
my
i
found
a
pencilled
farewell
now
mclean
constructed
perhaps
three
letters
in
the
year
painful
serious
events
like
an
interview
with
some
important
person
with
whom
your
speech
must
decorously
flow
no
matter
to
whom
he
was
writing
it
froze
all
nature
stiff
in
each
word
he
achieved
and
his
bald
business
diction
and
wild
archaic
penmanship
made
documents
that
i
value
among
my
choicest
correspondence
this
one
especially
wensday
four
dear
sir
this
is
to
inform
you
that
i
have
gone
to
separ
on
important
bisness
where
i
expect
to
meet
you
on
your
arrival
at
same
point
you
will
confer
a
favor
and
oblidge
undersigned
by
informing
miss
buckner
of
date
if
soon
you
fix
for
returning
per
stage
to
separ
as
miss
buckner
may
prefer
company
for
the
trip
being
long
and
poor
accommodations
yours
this
seemed
to
point
but
one
way
and
uncharitable
though
it
sound
that
this
girl
so
close
upon
bereavement
should
be
able
to
give
herself
to
a
lover
was
distasteful
to
me
but
most
extraordinary
lin
had
gone
away
without
a
word
to
her
and
she
was
left
as
plainly
in
the
dark
as
myself
after
her
first
frank
surprise
at
learning
of
his
departure
his
name
did
not
come
again
from
her
lips
at
any
rate
to
me
good
pierce
dropped
a
word
one
day
as
to
her
opinion
of
men
who
deceive
women
into
expecting
something
from
them
let
us
talk
straight
said
i
do
you
mean
that
miss
buckner
says
that
or
that
you
say
it
why
the
poor
thing
says
nothing
exclaimed
the
lady
it
like
a
man
to
think
she
would
and
i
not
say
anything
either
for
you
all
just
the
same
except
when
you
worse
and
that
lin
mclean
is
going
to
know
what
i
think
of
him
next
time
we
he
did
on
that
occasion
the
kind
old
dame
told
him
he
was
the
best
boy
in
the
country
and
stood
on
her
toes
and
kissed
him
but
meanwhile
we
did
not
know
why
he
had
gone
and
jessamine
though
he
was
never
subtle
or
cruel
enough
to
plan
such
a
thing
missed
him
and
thus
in
her
loneliness
had
the
chance
to
learn
how
much
he
had
been
to
her
though
pressed
to
stay
indefinitely
beneath
pierce
hospitable
roof
the
girl
after
lingering
awhile
and
going
often
to
that
nook
in
the
hill
by
riverside
took
her
departure
she
was
restless
yet
clung
to
the
neighborhood
it
was
with
a
wrench
that
she
fixed
her
going
when
i
told
her
of
my
own
journey
back
to
the
railroad
in
buffalo
she
walked
to
the
and
stood
a
moment
as
if
bidding
this
site
of
one
farewell
and
from
the
stage
she
watched
and
watched
the
receding
town
and
mountains
it
awful
to
be
leaving
him
she
said
excuse
me
for
acting
so
in
front
of
with
the
poignant
emptiness
overcoming
her
in
new
guise
she
blamed
herself
for
not
waiting
in
illinois
until
he
had
been
sent
to
joliet
for
then
so
near
home
he
must
have
gone
with
her
how
could
i
tell
her
that
nate
death
was
the
best
end
that
could
have
come
to
him
but
i
said
you
know
you
do
think
it
was
your
fault
you
know
you
would
do
the
same
she
listened
to
me
but
her
eyes
had
no
interest
in
them
he
never
knew
pain
i
pursued
and
he
died
doing
the
thing
he
liked
best
in
the
world
he
was
happy
and
enjoying
himself
and
you
gave
him
that
it
bad
only
for
you
some
would
talk
religion
but
i
yes
she
answered
i
can
think
of
him
so
glad
to
be
free
thank
you
for
saying
that
about
religion
do
you
think
it
wicked
not
to
want
it
to
hate
it
sometimes
i
hope
it
not
thank
you
during
our
journey
she
summoned
her
cheerfulness
and
all
that
she
said
was
wholesome
in
the
robust
coarse
soundness
of
her
fibre
the
wounds
of
grief
would
heal
and
leave
no
sickness
perhaps
no
higher
sensitiveness
to
human
sufferings
than
her
broad
native
kindness
already
held
we
touched
upon
religion
again
and
my
views
shocked
her
kentucky
notions
for
i
told
her
kentucky
locked
its
religion
in
an
iron
cage
called
sunday
which
made
it
very
savage
and
fond
of
biting
strangers
now
and
again
i
would
run
upon
that
vein
of
prejudice
that
was
in
her
character
like
some
fine
wire
in
short
our
disagreements
brought
us
to
terms
more
familiar
than
we
had
reached
hitherto
but
when
at
last
separ
came
where
was
i
there
stood
mclean
waiting
and
at
the
suddenness
of
him
she
had
no
time
to
remember
herself
but
stepped
out
of
the
stage
with
such
a
smile
that
the
ardent
flushed
and
beamed
so
i
went
away
without
telling
you
goodbye
he
began
not
wisely
mrs
pierce
has
been
circulating
war
talk
about
me
you
bet
the
maiden
in
jessamine
spoke
instantly
indeed
there
was
no
special
obligation
for
you
to
call
on
me
or
her
to
notice
if
you
oh
said
lin
crestfallen
yu
sure
do
mean
that
she
looked
at
him
and
was
compelled
to
melt
no
neighbor
i
mean
neighbor
he
exclaimed
and
again
neighbor
much
pleased
now
it
would
sound
kind
o
pleasant
if
you
call
me
that
for
a
steady
it
would
sound
kind
of
odd
mclean
thank
blamed
if
i
understand
her
cried
lin
blamed
if
i
do
but
going
to
understand
me
sure
quick
he
rushed
inside
the
station
spoke
sharply
to
the
agent
and
returned
in
the
same
tremor
of
elation
that
had
pushed
him
to
forwardness
with
his
girl
and
with
which
he
seemed
near
bursting
i
been
here
three
days
to
meet
you
there
a
letter
and
i
expect
i
know
what
in
it
tubercle
has
got
it
he
took
it
from
the
less
hasty
agent
and
thrust
it
in
jessamine
hand
you
need
to
fear
please
open
it
it
good
news
this
time
you
bet
he
watched
it
in
her
hand
as
the
boy
of
eight
watches
the
string
of
a
christmas
parcel
he
wishes
his
father
would
cut
instead
of
so
carefully
untie
open
it
he
urged
again
keeping
me
waiting
this
way
what
in
the
world
does
all
this
mean
cried
jessamine
stopping
short
at
the
first
sentence
read
said
lin
you
done
this
she
exclaimed
read
read
so
she
read
with
big
eyes
it
was
an
official
letter
of
the
railroad
written
by
the
division
superintendent
at
edgeford
it
hoped
miss
buckner
might
feel
like
taking
the
position
of
agent
at
separ
if
she
was
willing
to
consider
this
would
she
stop
over
at
edgeford
on
her
way
east
and
talk
with
the
superintendent
in
case
the
duties
were
more
than
she
had
been
accustomed
to
on
the
louisville
and
nashville
she
could
continue
east
with
the
loss
of
only
a
day
the
superintendent
believed
the
salary
could
be
arranged
satisfactorily
enclosed
please
to
find
an
order
for
a
free
ride
to
edgeford
jessamine
turned
her
wondering
eyes
on
lin
you
did
do
this
she
repeated
but
this
time
with
extraordinary
quietness
yes
said
he
and
i
am
plumb
proud
of
she
gave
a
rich
laugh
of
pleasure
and
amusement
a
long
laugh
and
stopped
did
anybody
ever
she
said
we
can
call
each
other
neighbors
now
yu
see
said
the
oh
no
oh
no
jessamine
declared
though
how
am
i
ever
to
thank
you
by
not
argufying
lin
answered
oh
no
no
i
can
do
no
such
thing
do
you
see
i
ca
i
believe
you
are
i
been
waiting
to
hear
yu
say
that
said
the
complacent
mclean
i
not
argufying
we
eat
supper
now
the
is
due
in
an
hour
and
i
expect
you
be
wanting
to
go
on
and
i
expect
i
go
too
said
the
girl
i
be
plumb
proud
to
have
yu
the
assented
i
going
to
get
my
ticket
to
chicago
right
now
said
jessamine
again
laughing
sunny
and
defiant
you
bet
you
are
said
the
incorrigible
mclean
he
let
her
go
into
the
station
serenely
you
ca
get
used
to
new
ideas
in
a
minute
he
remarked
to
me
i
figured
on
all
that
of
course
but
that
why
he
broke
out
impetuously
i
quit
you
on
bear
creek
so
sudden
she
goes
back
away
home
i
been
saying
to
myself
every
day
you
do
then
lin
mclean
well
i
knew
i
go
to
kentucky
too
just
knew
i
have
to
yu
see
and
it
was
inconvenient
turruble
inconvenient
billy
here
and
my
ranch
and
the
beef
comin
but
how
could
i
let
her
go
and
forget
me
take
up
maybe
with
some
back
there
and
i
hated
the
fix
i
was
in
till
that
morning
getting
up
i
was
joshin
the
virginia
man
that
after
miss
wood
i
been
sayin
no
educated
lady
would
think
of
a
man
who
talked
with
an
african
accent
repotted
you
have
a
southern
rival
yourself
says
he
joshin
back
so
i
said
i
guessed
the
rival
would
find
life
uneasy
does
says
he
man
with
his
voice
broke
in
two
halves
and
one
down
in
his
stomach
and
one
up
among
the
angels
is
goin
to
feel
uneasy
but
texas
talks
a
heap
about
his
lady
vigilante
in
the
i
said
and
i
must
have
jumped
for
they
all
asked
where
the
lightning
had
struck
and
in
fifteen
minutes
after
writing
you
i
hit
the
trail
for
separ
oh
i
figured
things
out
on
that
ride
mclean
here
clapped
me
on
the
back
got
to
separ
got
the
sheriff
address
the
sheriff
that
saw
her
that
night
they
held
up
the
locomotive
got
him
to
meet
me
at
edgeford
and
make
a
big
talk
to
the
superintendent
made
a
big
talk
myself
i
said
that
girl
in
charge
of
separ
and
the
boys
quit
shooting
your
but
tubercle
ca
influence
says
the
superintendent
that
and
when
i
told
him
it
was
the
agent
he
flapped
his
two
hands
down
on
the
chair
arms
each
side
of
him
and
went
to
rockin
up
and
down
i
said
the
agent
was
just
a
temptation
to
the
boys
to
be
gay
right
along
and
they
keep
can
choose
between
tubercle
and
your
tank
i
said
you
got
to
move
one
of
from
separ
if
went
peace
the
sheriff
backed
me
up
good
too
he
said
a
man
do
much
with
separ
the
way
it
was
now
but
a
decent
woman
would
be
respected
there
and
the
only
question
was
if
she
could
conduct
the
business
so
i
spoke
up
about
shawhan
and
when
the
whole
idea
began
to
soak
into
that
superintendent
his
eyeballs
jingled
and
he
looked
as
wise
as
a
see
her
says
he
and
he
going
to
see
well
said
i
you
deserve
success
after
thinking
of
a
thing
like
that
you
wholly
wasted
punching
cattle
but
she
going
to
chicago
by
eleven
she
will
have
passed
by
your
why
so
she
will
said
lin
affecting
surprise
he
baffled
me
and
he
baffled
jessamine
indeed
his
eagerness
with
her
parcels
his
assistance
in
checking
her
trunk
his
cheerful
examination
of
check
and
ticket
to
be
sure
they
read
over
the
same
route
plainly
failed
to
gratify
her
her
firmness
about
going
was
sincere
but
she
had
looked
for
more
dissuasion
and
this
sprightly
abettal
of
her
departure
seemed
to
leave
something
vacant
in
the
ceremonies
she
fell
singularly
taciturn
during
supper
at
the
hotel
brunswick
and
presently
observed
i
hope
i
shall
see
texas
said
lin
i
expect
they
have
tucked
him
in
bed
by
now
up
at
the
ranch
the
little
fellow
is
growing
he
can
walk
round
a
all
night
said
miss
buckner
stoutly
i
always
wanted
to
thank
him
for
looking
after
mclean
smiled
elaborately
at
his
plate
well
if
he
not
actually
thinking
he
tease
me
cried
out
jessamine
though
he
claims
not
to
be
foolish
like
donohoe
why
mclean
you
surely
must
have
been
young
once
see
if
you
remember
shucks
began
lin
but
her
laughter
routed
him
maybe
you
did
notice
you
were
young
she
said
but
do
you
reckon
perhaps
the
men
around
did
why
maybe
even
the
girls
kind
o
did
she
hard
to
beat
ai
she
inquired
lin
admiringly
of
me
in
my
opinion
she
was
she
had
her
wish
too
about
texas
for
we
found
him
waiting
on
the
railroad
platform
dressed
in
his
best
to
say
the
friendly
things
she
told
him
left
him
shuffling
and
repeating
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
go
a
big
mistake
but
when
she
said
the
butter
was
not
good
enough
his
laugh
cracked
joyously
up
into
the
treble
the
train
arrival
brought
quick
sadness
to
her
face
but
she
made
herself
bright
again
with
a
special
farewell
for
each
acquaintance
do
you
ride
any
more
she
warned
billy
lusk
or
have
to
come
back
and
look
after
you
said
you
and
me
were
going
for
a
ride
and
we
ai
shouted
the
you
will
murmured
mclean
oracularly
as
the
train
pace
quickened
he
did
not
step
off
and
miss
buckner
cried
jump
too
late
said
he
placidly
then
he
called
to
me
i
hard
to
beat
too
so
the
train
took
them
both
away
as
i
might
have
guessed
was
his
intention
all
along
is
that
marriage
again
said
billy
anxiously
he
would
tell
me
he
just
seeing
miss
buckner
as
far
as
edgeford
said
the
agent
be
back
then
i
do
see
why
he
would
take
me
along
billy
complained
and
separ
laughed
but
the
lover
was
not
back
he
was
capable
of
anything
gossip
remarked
and
took
up
new
themes
the
sun
rose
and
set
the
two
trains
made
their
daily
slight
event
and
gathering
the
glaring
bulkily
in
the
sun
beaconed
unmolested
and
the
agent
natural
sleep
was
unbroken
by
pistols
for
the
did
not
happen
to
be
in
town
separ
lay
a
clot
of
torpor
that
i
was
glad
to
leave
behind
me
for
a
while
but
news
is
a
strange
permeating
substance
and
it
began
to
be
sifted
through
the
air
that
tubercle
was
going
to
god
country
that
is
how
they
phrased
it
in
meaning
not
the
next
world
but
the
eastern
states
it
certainly
a
shame
him
leaving
after
we
got
him
so
good
and
used
to
us
said
the
virginian
we
ca
tell
him
said
honey
wiggin
separ
be
we
can
give
his
successor
a
right
hearty
welcome
the
virginian
suggested
that
you
said
honey
schemin
mischief
away
ahead
the
leadin
devil
in
this
country
and
just
because
yu
wear
a
face
you
tryin
to
fool
a
poor
yes
drawled
the
southerner
that
what
i
aiming
to
so
now
they
were
curious
about
the
successor
planning
their
hearty
welcome
for
that
official
and
were
encouraged
in
this
by
mclean
he
reappeared
in
the
neighborhood
with
a
manner
and
conversation
highly
casual
bring
your
new
wife
they
inquired
no
she
preferred
kentucky
lin
said
bring
the
old
one
no
she
preferred
kentucky
a
right
smart
way
to
chase
after
a
girl
said
the
virginian
sure
said
mclean
i
quit
at
he
met
their
few
remarks
so
smoothly
that
they
got
no
joy
from
him
and
being
asked
had
he
seen
the
new
agent
he
answered
yes
that
tubercle
had
gone
wednesday
and
his
successor
did
not
seem
to
be
much
of
a
man
but
to
me
lin
had
nothing
to
say
until
noon
camp
was
scattering
from
its
lunch
to
work
when
he
passed
close
and
whispered
you
see
her
if
you
go
in
with
the
then
looking
round
to
make
sure
we
were
alone
in
the
he
drew
from
his
pocket
cherishingly
a
little
shining
pistol
hers
said
he
simply
i
looked
at
him
we
exchanged
he
said
he
turned
the
token
in
his
hand
caressing
it
as
on
that
first
night
when
jessamine
had
taken
his
heart
captive
my
idea
he
added
unable
to
lift
his
eyes
from
the
treasure
see
this
i
looked
and
there
was
the
word
neighbor
engraved
on
it
her
idea
said
he
a
good
one
i
murmured
it
on
both
yu
know
we
had
it
put
on
the
day
she
settled
to
accept
the
superintendent
here
lin
fired
his
small
exchanged
weapon
at
a
striking
low
she
can
beat
that
with
mine
he
exclaimed
proud
and
tender
she
took
four
days
deciding
at
edgeford
and
i
learned
her
to
hit
the
ace
of
he
showed
me
the
cards
they
had
practiced
upon
during
those
four
days
of
indecision
he
had
them
in
a
book
as
if
they
were
pressed
flowers
they
wo
get
crumpled
that
way
said
he
and
he
further
showed
me
a
tintype
she
got
the
other
at
separ
he
finished
i
shook
his
hand
with
all
my
might
yes
he
was
worthy
of
her
yes
he
deserved
this
smooth
course
his
love
was
running
and
i
shook
his
hand
again
to
tonic
her
grief
jessamine
had
longed
for
some
activity
some
work
and
he
had
shown
her
wyoming
might
hold
this
for
her
as
well
as
kentucky
but
how
in
the
world
i
asked
him
did
you
persuade
her
to
stop
over
at
edgeford
at
all
yu
must
forget
said
the
lover
and
he
blushed
that
i
had
her
four
hours
alone
on
the
but
his
face
that
evening
round
the
fire
when
they
talked
of
their
next
day
welcome
to
the
new
agent
became
comedy
of
the
highest
and
he
was
so
desperately
canny
in
the
moments
he
chose
for
silence
or
for
comment
he
had
not
been
sure
of
their
ignorance
until
he
arrived
and
it
was
a
joke
with
him
too
deep
for
laughter
he
had
a
special
eye
upon
the
virginian
his
mate
in
such
a
tale
of
mischiefs
and
now
he
led
him
on
he
suggested
to
the
southerner
that
caution
might
be
wise
this
change
at
separ
was
perhaps
some
new
trick
of
the
company
we
mostly
take
their
tricks
observed
the
virginian
yes
said
lin
nodding
sagely
at
the
fire
that
so
yet
not
he
not
any
one
could
have
foreseen
the
mortifying
harmlessness
of
the
outcome
they
swept
down
upon
separ
like
all
the
hordes
of
legend
more
egregiously
perhaps
because
they
were
and
no
serious
horde
would
go
on
so
our
final
hundred
yards
of
speed
and
copious
howling
brought
all
dwellers
in
separ
out
to
gaze
and
disappear
like
rabbits
all
save
the
new
agent
in
the
station
nobody
ran
out
or
in
there
and
the
horde
whirled
up
to
the
tiny
defenceless
building
and
leaped
to
earth
except
lin
and
me
we
sat
watching
the
innocent
door
stood
open
wide
to
any
cool
breeze
or
invasion
and
honey
wiggin
tramped
in
foremost
hat
lowering
over
eyes
and
pistol
prominent
he
stopped
rooted
staring
and
his
mouth
came
open
slowly
his
hand
went
feeling
up
for
his
hat
and
came
down
with
it
by
degrees
as
by
degrees
his
grin
spread
then
in
a
milky
voice
he
said
why
excuse
me
there
answered
a
clear
long
rippling
ample
laugh
it
came
out
of
the
open
door
into
the
heat
it
made
the
air
merry
it
seemed
to
welcome
and
mock
it
genially
hovered
about
us
in
the
dusty
quiet
of
separ
for
there
was
no
other
sound
anywhere
at
all
in
the
place
and
the
great
plain
stretched
away
silent
all
round
it
the
bulging
shone
overhead
in
bland
ironic
safety
the
horde
stood
blank
then
it
shifted
its
legs
looked
sideways
at
itself
and
in
a
hesitating
clump
reached
the
door
shambled
in
and
removed
its
foolish
hat
gentlemen
said
jessamine
buckner
seated
behind
her
railing
and
various
voices
endeavored
to
reply
conventionally
if
you
have
any
letters
said
the
virginian
more
inventive
i
take
them
letters
for
judge
he
knew
the
judge
office
was
seventy
miles
from
here
any
for
the
c
muttered
another
likewise
knowing
better
it
was
a
happy
if
simple
thought
and
most
of
them
inquired
for
the
mail
jessamine
sought
carefully
making
them
repeat
their
names
which
some
did
guiltily
they
foresaw
how
soon
the
lady
would
find
out
no
letters
ever
came
for
these
names
there
was
no
letter
for
any
one
present
i
sorry
truly
said
jessamine
behind
the
railing
for
you
seemed
real
anxious
to
get
news
better
luck
next
time
and
if
i
make
mistakes
please
everybody
set
me
straight
for
of
course
i
do
understand
things
yes
thank
yu
they
got
themselves
out
of
the
station
and
into
their
saddles
no
she
do
understand
things
yet
soliloquized
the
virginian
oh
dear
he
turned
his
slow
dark
eyes
upon
us
you
lin
mclean
said
he
in
his
gentle
voice
you
have
fooled
me
plumb
through
this
then
the
horde
rode
out
of
town
chastened
and
orderly
till
it
was
quite
small
across
the
sagebrush
when
reaction
seized
it
it
sped
suddenly
and
vanished
in
dust
with
far
hilarious
cries
and
here
were
lin
and
i
and
here
towered
the
shining
and
shining
thus
did
separ
vigilante
take
possession
and
vindicate
lin
knowledge
of
his
kind
it
was
not
three
days
until
the
virginian
that
lynx
observer
fixed
his
grave
eyes
upon
mclean
is
as
cute
a
name
for
a
as
ever
i
heard
said
he
but
she
never
have
need
of
your
gun
in
separ
only
to
shoot
up
peaceful
while
she
hearkens
to
your
that
was
his
way
of
congratulation
to
a
brother
lover
plumb
strange
he
said
to
me
one
morning
after
an
hour
of
riding
in
silence
how
a
man
will
win
two
women
while
another
man
gets
aged
waitin
for
your
hair
seems
black
as
ever
said
i
my
hopes
ai
so
glossy
any
more
he
answered
lin
has
done
better
this
second
mrs
lusk
do
count
said
i
i
reckon
she
counted
mighty
plentiful
when
he
thought
he
got
her
clamped
to
him
by
lawful
marriage
but
lin
and
the
virginian
fell
silent
again
lucky
lin
bestirred
him
over
his
work
his
plans
his
ranch
on
box
elder
that
was
one
day
to
be
a
home
for
his
lady
he
came
and
went
seeing
his
idea
triumph
and
his
girl
respected
not
only
was
she
a
girl
but
a
good
shot
too
and
as
if
she
and
her
small
neat
home
were
a
sort
of
possession
the
would
boast
of
her
to
strangers
they
would
have
dealt
heavily
now
with
the
wretch
who
should
trifle
with
the
when
camp
came
within
visiting
distance
you
would
see
one
or
another
shaving
and
parting
his
hair
they
wrote
unnecessary
letters
and
brought
them
to
mail
as
excuses
for
an
afternoon
call
honey
wiggin
more
original
would
look
in
the
door
with
his
grin
and
hold
up
an
ace
of
clubs
i
thought
maybe
yu
could
spare
a
minute
for
a
he
would
insinuate
and
separ
now
heard
no
more
objectionable
shooting
than
this
texas
brought
her
presents
of
game
antelope
but
shyness
intervening
he
left
them
outside
the
door
and
entering
dressed
in
all
the
sunday
that
he
had
would
sit
dumbly
in
the
lady
presence
i
remember
his
emerging
from
one
of
these
placid
interviews
straight
into
the
hands
of
his
tormentors
if
she
do
notice
your
clothes
texas
said
the
virginian
just
mention
them
to
now
yer
done
offended
her
shrilled
manassas
donohoe
she
heard
she
hear
you
singin
sooprano
said
honey
wiggin
it
good
this
country
has
reformed
or
they
have
you
warblin
in
some
and
corrupt
your
you
can
corrupt
the
morals
of
a
soprano
man
observed
the
virginian
go
and
play
with
billy
till
you
can
talk
but
it
was
the
boldest
adults
that
billy
chose
for
playmates
texas
he
found
immature
moreover
when
next
he
came
he
desired
play
with
no
one
summer
was
done
september
full
moon
was
several
nights
ago
he
had
gone
on
his
hunt
with
lin
and
now
were
at
hand
but
more
than
this
clouded
his
mind
he
had
been
brought
to
say
to
jessamine
buckner
who
had
scarcely
seen
him
and
to
give
her
a
a
hunting
trophy
she
can
have
it
he
told
me
i
like
then
he
stole
a
look
at
his
guardian
if
they
get
married
and
send
me
back
to
mother
said
he
i
run
away
so
school
and
this
old
dread
haunted
the
child
while
for
the
man
lin
the
lucky
who
suspected
nothing
of
it
time
was
ever
bringing
love
nearer
to
his
hearth
his
jessamine
had
visited
box
elder
and
even
said
she
wanted
chickens
there
since
when
mclean
might
occasionally
have
been
seen
at
his
cabin
worrying
over
fowls
feeding
and
cursing
them
with
equal
care
spring
would
see
him
married
he
told
me
this
time
right
he
exclaimed
and
i
want
her
to
know
billy
some
more
before
he
goes
to
bear
ah
bear
creek
said
billy
acidly
why
ca
i
stay
home
home
sounds
kind
o
slick
said
lin
to
me
do
it
now
is
closer
than
you
bet
billy
put
the
horses
in
the
corral
and
ask
miss
buckner
if
we
can
come
and
see
her
after
supper
if
good
maybe
she
take
yu
for
a
ride
and
kid
ask
her
about
again
suspicion
quivered
over
billy
face
and
he
dragged
his
horses
angrily
to
the
corral
lin
nudged
me
laughing
i
can
rile
him
every
time
about
laramie
said
he
affectionately
i
would
have
believed
the
kid
set
so
much
store
by
me
nor
i
did
need
to
ask
jessamine
to
love
him
for
my
sake
what
do
yu
suppose
before
i
got
far
as
thinking
of
billy
at
all
right
after
edgeford
when
my
head
was
just
a
whirl
of
joy
jessamine
says
to
me
one
day
that
it
was
governor
barker
writin
to
her
about
her
brother
and
her
lin
paused
and
about
me
i
ca
never
tell
you
but
he
said
a
heap
i
did
deserve
and
he
told
her
about
me
picking
up
billy
in
denver
streets
that
time
and
doing
for
him
because
his
own
home
was
not
a
good
one
governor
barker
wrote
jessamine
all
that
and
she
said
did
you
never
tell
me
and
i
said
it
anything
to
tell
and
she
just
said
to
me
shall
be
as
if
he
was
your
son
and
i
was
his
mother
and
that
the
first
regular
kiss
she
ever
gave
me
i
did
have
to
take
myself
god
bless
her
god
bless
her
as
we
ate
our
supper
young
billy
burst
out
of
brooding
silence
i
did
ask
her
about
laramie
so
there
well
well
kid
said
the
patting
his
head
yu
to
i
but
billy
eye
remained
sullen
and
jealous
he
paid
slight
attention
to
the
of
soldiers
and
war
that
jessamine
gave
him
when
we
went
over
to
the
station
she
had
her
own
books
some
flowers
in
pots
a
and
a
cosey
lamp
that
shone
on
her
bright
face
and
dark
dress
we
drew
stools
from
the
office
desks
and
billy
perched
silently
on
one
scanty
room
for
company
jessamine
said
but
we
must
make
out
this
way
till
we
have
another
she
smiled
on
lin
and
billy
face
darkened
do
you
know
she
pursued
to
me
with
all
those
chickens
mclean
tells
me
about
never
a
one
has
he
thought
to
bring
livin
or
dead
do
you
want
inquired
lin
oh
i
not
bother
you
donohoe
says
he
will
texas
chickens

then
he
have
to
steal
and
we
all
laughed
together
you
wo
make
me
go
back
to
laramie
will
you
spoke
billy
suddenly
from
his
stool
i
like
to
see
anybody
try
to
make
you
exclaimed
jessamine
who
says
any
such
thing
lin
did
said
billy
jessamine
looked
at
her
lover
reproachfully
what
a
way
to
tease
him
she
said
and
you
so
kind
why
you
hurt
his
feelings
i
never
thought
said
lin
the
boisterous
i
would
come
sit
here
billy
said
jessamine
whenever
he
teases
you
tell
me
and
we
make
him
honest
persisted
billy
shake
hands
on
it
said
jessamine
cause
i
go
to
school
but
i
wo
go
back
to
laramie
for
no
one
and
you
to
be
lin
wife
honest
honest
honest
and
jessamine
laughing
grew
red
beside
her
lamp
then
i
guess
mother
ca
never
come
back
to
lin
either
stated
billy
relieved
jessamine
let
fall
the
child
hand
cause
she
liked
him
onced
and
he
liked
jessamine
gazed
at
lin
it
simple
said
the
it
all
but
jessamine
sat
by
her
lamp
very
pale
it
all
right
repeated
lin
in
the
silence
shifting
his
foot
and
looking
down
once
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
worse
than
billy
whispered
jessamine
then
you
but
his
name
is
lusk
course
it
is
said
billy
father
and
mother
are
living
in
it
all
straight
said
the
i
never
saw
her
till
three
years
ago
i
have
anything
to
hide
only
only
only
it
do
come
easy
to
i
rose
miss
buckner
said
i
he
will
tell
you
but
he
will
not
tell
you
he
paid
dearly
for
what
was
no
fault
of
his
it
has
been
no
secret
it
is
only
something
his
friends
and
his
enemies
have
but
all
the
while
i
was
speaking
this
jessamine
eyes
were
fixed
on
lin
and
her
face
remained
white
i
left
the
girl
and
the
man
and
the
little
boy
together
and
crossed
to
the
hotel
but
its
air
was
foul
and
i
got
my
roll
of
camp
blankets
to
sleep
in
the
clean
night
if
should
come
meanwhile
i
walked
about
in
the
silence
to
have
taken
a
wife
once
in
good
faith
ignorant
she
was
another
left
no
stain
raised
no
barrier
i
could
have
told
jessamine
the
same
old
story
myself
or
almost
but
what
had
it
to
do
with
her
at
all
why
need
she
know
reasoning
thus
yet
with
something
left
uncleared
by
reason
that
i
could
not
state
i
watched
the
moon
edge
into
sight
heavy
and
a
of
glow
seemingly
near
like
a
great
lantern
tilted
over
the
plain
the
smell
of
the
flavored
the
air
the
hush
of
wyoming
folded
distant
and
near
things
and
all
separ
but
those
three
inside
the
lighted
window
were
in
bed
dark
windows
were
everywhere
else
and
looming
above
rose
the
a
dull
mass
in
the
night
and
forever
somehow
to
me
a
sphinx
emblem
the
vision
i
instantly
see
when
i
think
of
separ
soon
i
heard
a
door
creaking
it
was
billy
coming
alone
and
on
seeing
me
he
walked
up
and
spoke
in
a
voice
she
said
he
i
withheld
from
questions
and
as
he
kept
along
by
my
side
he
said
sorry
do
you
think
she
mad
with
lin
for
what
he
told
her
she
just
sat
and
when
she
started
crying
he
made
me
go
i
do
believe
she
mad
i
told
billy
and
i
sat
down
on
my
blanket
he
beside
me
talking
while
the
moon
grew
small
as
it
rose
over
the
plain
and
the
light
steadily
shone
in
jessamine
window
soon
young
billy
fell
asleep
and
i
looked
at
him
thinking
how
in
a
way
it
was
he
who
had
brought
this
trouble
on
the
man
who
had
saved
him
and
loved
him
but
that
man
had
no
such
untender
thoughts
once
more
the
door
opened
and
it
was
he
who
came
this
time
alone
also
she
did
not
follow
him
and
stand
to
watch
him
from
the
threshold
though
he
forgot
to
close
the
door
and
coming
over
to
me
stood
looking
down
what
i
said
at
length
i
do
know
that
he
heard
me
he
stooped
over
billy
and
shook
him
gently
wake
son
said
he
you
and
i
must
get
to
our
camp
now
said
billy
ca
we
wait
till
morning
no
son
we
ca
wait
here
any
more
go
and
get
the
horses
and
put
the
saddles
as
billy
obeyed
lin
looked
at
the
lighted
window
she
is
in
there
he
said
she
in
there
so
he
looked
and
turned
to
the
hotel
from
which
he
brought
his
chaps
and
spurs
and
put
them
on
i
understand
her
words
he
continued
her
words
the
meaning
of
them
but
not
what
she
means
i
guess
it
will
take
studyin
over
why
she
do
blame
me
he
suddenly
said
speaking
to
me
instead
of
to
himself
lin
i
answered
she
has
only
just
heard
this
you
see
wait
that
not
the
trouble
she
knows
what
kind
of
man
i
have
been
and
she
forgives
that
just
the
way
she
did
her
brother
and
she
knows
how
i
did
intentionally
conceal
anything
billy
has
been
around
and
she
never
realized
about
his
mother
and
me
we
talked
awful
open
but
that
was
not
pleasant
to
speak
of
and
the
whole
country
knew
it
so
long
and
i
never
thought
she
do
blame
me
she
says
she
understands
but
she
says
i
have
a
wife
that
is
nonsense
i
declared
yu
must
say
that
said
he
she
do
claim
she
a
wife
either
she
just
shakes
her
head
when
i
asked
her
why
she
feels
so
it
must
be
different
to
you
and
me
from
the
way
it
seems
to
her
i
do
see
her
view
maybe
i
never
can
see
it
but
she
made
me
feel
she
has
it
and
that
she
honest
and
loves
me
true
his
voice
broke
for
a
moment
she
said
she
you
ca
have
a
marriage
broken
that
was
never
tied
i
said
but
perhaps
governor
barker
or
judge
henry
no
said
the
law
could
fool
her
she
thinking
of
something
back
of
law
she
said
she
wait
always
and
when
i
took
it
in
that
this
was
all
over
and
done
and
when
i
thought
of
my
ranch
and
the
chickens
well
i
could
think
of
things
at
all
and
i
came
and
waked
billy
to
clear
out
and
what
did
you
tell
her
i
asked
tell
her
nothin
i
guess
i
do
remember
getting
out
of
the
room
why
here
actually
her
pistol
and
she
got
mine
man
man
said
i
go
back
and
tell
her
to
keep
it
and
that
wait
too
always
would
yu
look
i
pointed
to
jessamine
standing
in
the
door
i
saw
his
face
as
he
turned
to
her
and
i
walked
toward
billy
and
the
horses
presently
i
heard
steps
on
the
wooden
station
and
from
its
black
brief
shadow
the
two
came
walking
lin
and
his
sweetheart
into
the
moonlight
they
were
not
speaking
but
merely
walked
together
in
the
clear
radiance
hand
in
hand
like
two
children
i
saw
that
she
was
weeping
and
that
beneath
the
tyranny
of
her
resolution
her
whole
loving
ample
nature
was
wrung
but
the
strange
narrow
fibre
in
her
would
not
yield
i
saw
them
go
to
the
horses
and
jessamine
stood
while
billy
and
lin
mounted
then
quickly
the
sprang
down
again
and
folded
her
in
his
arms
lin
dear
lin
dear
neighbor
she
sobbed
she
could
not
withhold
this
last
i
do
not
think
he
spoke
in
a
moment
the
horses
started
and
were
gone
flying
rushing
away
into
the
great
plain
until
sight
and
sound
of
them
were
lost
and
only
the
was
there
bathed
in
the
high
bright
moon
the
last
thing
i
remember
as
i
lay
in
my
blankets
was
window
still
lighted
and
the
and
black
standing
over
separ
destiny
at
drybone
part
i
children
have
many
special
endowments
and
of
these
the
chiefest
is
to
ask
questions
that
their
elders
must
skirmish
to
evade
married
people
and
aunts
and
uncles
commonly
discover
this
but
mere
instinct
does
not
guide
one
to
it
a
maiden
of
will
not
necessarily
divine
it
now
except
in
one
unhappy
hour
of
stress
and
surprise
miss
jessamine
buckner
had
been
more
than
equal
to
life
thus
far
but
never
yet
had
she
been
shut
up
a
whole
day
in
one
room
with
a
boy
of
nine
had
this
experience
been
hers
perhaps
she
would
not
have
written
to
mclean
the
friendly
and
singular
letter
in
which
she
hoped
he
was
well
and
said
that
she
was
very
well
and
how
was
dear
little
billy
she
was
glad
mclean
had
stayed
away
that
was
just
like
his
honorable
nature
and
what
she
expected
of
him
and
she
was
perfectly
happy
at
separ
and
yours
sincerely
and
always
postscript
talking
of
billy
lusk
if
lin
was
busy
with
gathering
the
cattle
why
not
send
billy
down
to
stop
quietly
with
her
she
would
make
him
a
bed
in
the
and
there
she
would
be
to
see
after
him
all
the
time
she
knew
lin
did
not
like
his
adopted
child
to
be
too
much
in
with
the
men
she
would
adopt
him
too
for
just
as
long
as
convenient
to
lin
until
the
school
opened
on
bear
creek
if
lin
so
wished
jessamine
wrote
a
good
deal
about
how
much
better
care
any
woman
can
take
of
a
boy
of
billy
age
than
any
man
knows
the
brought
the
answer
to
this
remarkably
soon
young
billy
with
a
trunk
and
a
letter
of
twelve
pages
in
pencil
and
ink
the
only
writing
of
this
length
ever
done
by
mclean
i
can
write
a
lot
quicker
than
lin
said
billy
upon
arriving
he
was
fussing
at
that
away
late
by
the
fire
in
camp
an
waked
me
up
crawling
in
our
bed
an
then
he
had
to
finish
it
next
night
when
he
went
over
to
the
cabin
for
my
you
do
say
said
jessamine
and
billy
suffered
her
to
kiss
him
again
when
not
otherwise
occupied
jessamine
took
the
letter
out
of
its
locked
box
and
read
it
or
looked
at
it
thus
the
first
days
had
gone
finely
at
separ
the
weather
being
beautiful
and
billy
much
but
sometimes
the
weather
changes
in
wyoming
and
now
it
was
that
miss
jessamine
learned
the
talents
of
childhood
soon
after
breakfast
this
stormy
morning
billy
observed
the
twelve
pages
being
taken
out
of
their
box
and
spoke
from
his
sudden
brain
honey
wiggin
says
lin
losing
his
grip
about
girls
he
remarked
he
says
you
could
downed
him
onced
you
had
to
marry
him
honey
says
lin
ai
worked
it
like
he
done
in
old
now
i
should
wonder
if
he
was
right
said
jessamine
buoyantly
and
that
being
the
case
i
going
to
set
to
work
at
your
things
till
it
clears
and
then
we
go
for
our
yes
said
billy
when
does
a
man
get
too
old
to
marry
i
only
a
girl
you
see
i
do
yes
honey
said
he
would
thought
lin
was
that
old
but
i
guess
he
must
be
old
exclaimed
jessamine
and
she
looked
at
a
photograph
upon
her
table
but
lin
ai
been
married
very
much
pursued
billy
mother
the
only
one
they
speak
of
you
do
have
to
stay
married
always
do
you
it
better
to
said
jessamine
ah
i
do
think
so
said
billy
with
disparagement
you
ought
to
see
mother
and
father
i
wish
you
would
leave
lin
marry
you
though
said
the
boy
coming
to
her
with
an
impulse
of
affection
why
wo
you
if
he
do
mind
she
continued
to
parry
him
but
this
was
not
a
very
smooth
start
for
eight
in
the
morning
moments
of
lull
there
were
when
the
telegraph
called
her
to
the
front
room
and
billy
young
mind
shifted
to
inquiries
about
the
cipher
alphabet
and
she
gained
at
least
an
hour
teaching
him
to
read
various
words
by
the
sound
at
dinner
too
he
was
refreshingly
silent
but
such
silences
are
unsafe
and
the
weather
was
still
bad
four
found
them
much
where
they
had
been
at
eight
please
tell
me
why
you
wo
leave
lin
marry
he
was
at
the
window
kicking
the
wall
that
nine
times
since
dinner
she
replied
with
tireless
good
humor
now
if
you
ask
me
twelve
you
tell
said
the
boy
swiftly
she
broke
into
a
laugh
no
i
go
riding
and
you
stay
at
home
when
i
was
little
and
would
ask
things
beyond
me
they
only
gave
me
three
i
got
two
more
anyway
better
save
up
what
did
they
do
to
you
ah
i
do
want
to
go
it
nasty
all
he
stared
out
at
the
day
against
which
separ
doors
had
been
tight
closed
since
morning
eight
hours
of
furious
wind
had
raised
the
dust
like
a
sea
i
wish
the
old
train
would
come
observed
billy
continuing
to
kick
the
wall
i
wish
i
was
going
smoky
level
and
hot
the
south
wind
leapt
into
separ
across
five
hundred
unbroken
miles
the
plain
was
blanketed
in
a
tawny
eclipse
each
minute
the
near
buildings
became
invisible
in
a
turbulent
herd
of
clouds
above
this
travelling
blur
of
the
soil
the
top
of
the
alone
rose
bulging
into
the
clear
sun
the
sand
spirals
would
lick
like
flames
along
the
bulk
of
the
lofty
tub
and
soar
skyward
it
was
not
shipping
season
the
stood
idle
in
a
long
line
no
cattle
huddled
in
the
corrals
no
strangers
moved
in
town
no
dozed
in
front
of
the
saloon
their
riders
were
distant
in
ranch
and
camp
human
noise
was
extinct
in
separ
beneath
the
thunder
of
the
sultry
blasts
the
place
lay
dead
in
its
flapping
shroud
of
dust
why
wo
you
tell
me
droned
billy
for
some
time
he
had
been
returning
like
a
mosquito
brushed
away
that
ten
times
said
jessamine
promptly
oh
goodness
pretty
soon
i
not
be
glad
i
came
i
about
twiced
as
less
glad
well
said
jessamine
there
a
man
coming
to
mend
the
government
between
drybone
and
mckinney
maybe
he
would
take
you
back
as
far
as
box
elder
if
you
want
to
go
very
much
shall
i
ask
him
billy
was
disappointed
at
this
cordial
seconding
of
his
mood
he
did
not
make
a
direct
rejoinder
i
guess
i
go
outside
now
said
he
with
a
threat
in
his
tone
she
continued
mending
his
stockings
finished
ones
lay
rolled
at
one
side
of
her
chair
and
upon
the
other
were
more
waiting
her
attention
and
i
going
to
turn
back
on
top
of
all
the
he
stated
more
loudly
she
indulged
again
in
merriment
laughing
sweetly
at
him
and
without
restraint
and
i
sick
of
what
you
all
keep
to
me
he
shouted
just
as
if
i
was
a
why
billy
who
ever
said
you
were
a
baby
all
of
you
do
honey
and
lin
and
you
now
and
everybody
what
makes
you
say
nine
times
billy
oh
billy
that
ten
times
if
you
do
mean
i
a
baby
and
you
laugh
me
off
just
like
they
do
and
just
like
i
was
a
regular
baby
you
wo
tell
me
billy
listen
did
nobody
ever
ask
you
something
you
did
not
want
to
tell
them
that
not
a
bit
the
same
because
because
because
i
treat
square
and
because
it
not
their
business
but
every
time
i
ask
anybody
anything
they
say
i
not
old
enough
to
understand
and
i
be
ten
soon
and
it
is
my
business
when
it
about
the
kind
of
a
mother
agoing
to
have
suppose
i
quit
acting
square
an
told
when
they
bothered
me
they
were
young
enough
to
understand
wish
i
had
guess
i
will
too
and
watch
step
for
a
moment
his
mind
dwelt
upon
this
and
he
whistled
a
revengeful
strain
goodness
billy
said
jessamine
at
the
sight
of
the
next
stocking
the
whole
heel
is
scorched
he
eyed
the
ruin
with
indifference
ah
that
was
last
month
when
i
and
lin
shot
the
bear
in
the
swamp
willows
he
made
me
dry
off
my
legs
chuck
it
and
spoil
the
pair
no
indeed
mother
always
chucked
an
father
buy
new
ones
till
i
skipped
from
home
lin
kind
o
mends
does
he
said
jessamine
softly
and
she
looked
at
the
photograph
yes
what
made
you
write
him
for
to
let
me
come
and
bring
my
and
things
do
you
see
billy
there
is
so
little
work
at
this
station
that
be
looking
out
of
the
window
all
day
just
the
pitiful
way
you
do
oh
billy
pondered
and
so
i
said
to
lin
he
continued
why
he
send
down
his
own
clothes
too
an
let
you
fix
all
and
honey
wiggin
laughed
right
in
his
so
it
all
sploshed
out
and
the
cook
he
asked
me
if
mother
used
to
mend
lin
clothes
but
i
guess
she
chucked
like
she
always
did
father
and
mine
i
was
with
father
you
know
when
mother
was
married
to
lin
that
he
paused
again
while
his
thoughts
and
fears
struggled
but
lin
says
i
need
ever
go
back
he
went
on
reasoning
and
confiding
to
her
lin
do
like
mother
any
more
i
his
pondering
grew
still
deeper
and
he
looked
at
jessamine
for
some
while
then
his
face
wakened
with
a
new
theory
do
lin
like
you
any
more
he
inquired
oh
cried
jessamine
crimsoning
yes
why
he
sent
you
to
me
well
he
got
hot
in
camp
when
i
said
that
about
sending
his
clothes
to
you
he
quit
supper
pretty
soon
and
went
away
off
a
walking
and
another
time
they
said
i
was
too
young
but
lin
do
come
to
see
you
any
why
i
hope
he
loves
me
murmured
jessamine
well
i
hope
so
too
said
billy
earnestly
for
i
like
you
when
i
seen
him
show
you
our
cabin
on
box
elder
and
the
room
he
had
fixed
for
you
i
was
glad
you
were
coming
to
be
my
mother
mother
used
to
be
awful
i
would
minded
her
licking
me
if
she
done
other
things
ah
pshaw
i
was
going
to
stand
billy
now
came
close
to
jessamine
i
do
wish
you
would
come
and
live
with
me
and
lin
said
he
lin
awful
do
i
know
it
said
jessamine
tenderly
cause
i
heard
you
say
you
were
going
to
marry
him
went
on
billy
and
i
seen
him
kiss
you
and
you
let
him
that
time
we
went
away
when
you
found
out
about
mother
and
you
not
mad
and
he
not
and
nothing
happens
at
all
all
the
same
wo
you
tell
me
please
jessamine
eyes
were
glistening
and
she
took
him
in
her
lap
she
was
not
going
to
tell
him
that
he
was
too
young
this
time
but
whatever
things
she
had
shaped
to
say
to
the
boy
were
never
said
through
the
noise
of
the
gale
came
the
steadier
sound
of
the
train
and
the
girl
rose
quickly
to
preside
over
her
and
duties
behind
the
railing
in
the
front
room
of
the
station
the
boy
ran
to
the
window
to
watch
the
great
event
of
separ
day
the
locomotive
loomed
out
from
the
yellow
clots
of
drift
paused
at
the
and
then
with
steam
and
humming
came
slowly
on
by
the
platform
slowly
its
long
train
emerged
trundling
behind
it
and
ponderously
halted
there
was
no
one
to
go
no
one
came
to
buy
a
ticket
of
jessamine
the
conductor
looked
in
on
business
but
she
had
no
telegraphic
orders
for
him
the
express
agent
jumped
off
and
looked
in
for
pleasure
he
received
his
daily
smile
and
nod
of
friendly
discouragement
then
the
light
bundle
of
mail
was
flung
inside
the
door
separ
had
no
mail
to
go
out
as
she
was
picking
up
the
letters
young
billy
passed
her
like
a
shadow
and
fled
out
two
passengers
had
descended
from
the
train
a
man
and
a
large
woman
his
clothes
were
loose
and
careless
upon
him
he
held
valises
and
stood
uncertainly
looking
about
him
in
the
storm
her
firm
heavy
body
was
closely
dressed
in
her
hat
was
a
large
handsome
feather
along
between
the
several
cars
brakemen
leaned
out
watched
her
and
grinned
to
each
other
but
her
big
blue
eyes
were
fixed
curiously
upon
the
station
where
jessamine
was
it
all
night
we
may
be
here
is
it
she
said
to
the
man
harshly
how
am
i
to
help
that
he
retorted
i
help
it
if
this
hotel
the
sty
it
used
to
be
i
walk
to
tommy
i
not
saw
him
since
i
left
bear
she
stalked
into
the
hotel
while
the
man
went
slowly
to
the
station
he
entered
and
found
jessamine
behind
her
railing
sorting
the
slim
mail
he
said
excuse
me
there
was
to
be
a
wagon
sent
for
the
yes
sir
it
came
tuesday
you
to
find
the
at
this
news
was
good
and
all
that
he
wished
to
know
he
could
drive
out
and
escape
a
night
at
the
hotel
brunswick
but
he
lingered
because
jessamine
spoke
so
pleasantly
to
him
he
had
heard
of
her
also
governor
barker
has
not
been
around
here
he
said
not
yet
sir
we
understand
he
is
expected
through
on
a
i
suppose
there
is
room
for
two
and
a
trunk
on
that
wagon
i
reckon
so
jessamine
glanced
at
the
man
and
he
took
himself
out
most
men
took
themselves
out
if
jessamine
so
willed
and
it
was
mostly
achieved
thus
in
amity
on
the
platform
the
man
found
his
wife
again
then
i
need
to
walk
to
tommy
she
said
and
we
eat
as
we
travel
but
you
wait
till
i
through
with
she
made
a
gesture
toward
the
station
why
why
what
do
you
want
with
her
do
you
know
who
she
is
it
was
me
told
you
who
she
was
james
lusk
you
wait
till
i
been
and
asked
her
after
lin
mclean
health
and
till
i
saw
how
the
likes
of
her
talks
to
the
likes
of
he
made
a
feeble
protest
that
this
would
do
no
one
any
good
sew
yourself
up
james
lusk
if
it
has
been
your
idea
i
come
with
yus
clear
from
laramie
to
watch
yus
plant
in
the
why
you
off
i
ai
heard
much
lin
since
the
day
he
learned
it
was
you
and
not
him
that
was
my
husband
and
i
come
back
in
this
country
to
have
a
look
at
my
old
friends
and
she
laughed
loudly
and
nodded
at
the
station
my
old
friends
new
friends
thus
ordered
the
husband
wandered
away
to
find
his
wagon
and
the
horse
jessamine
in
the
office
had
finished
her
station
duties
and
returned
to
her
needle
she
sat
contemplating
the
scorched
sock
of
billy
and
heard
a
heavy
step
at
the
threshold
she
turned
and
there
was
the
large
woman
with
the
feather
quietly
surveying
her
the
words
which
the
stranger
spoke
then
were
usual
enough
for
a
beginning
but
there
was
something
of
threat
in
the
strong
animal
countenance
something
of
laughter
ready
to
break
out
much
beauty
of
its
kind
had
evidently
been
in
the
face
and
now
as
substitute
for
what
was
gone
was
the
brag
look
of
assertion
that
it
was
still
all
there
many
stranded
travellers
knocked
at
jessamine
door
and
now
as
always
she
offered
the
hospitalities
of
her
neat
abode
the
only
room
in
separ
fit
for
a
woman
as
she
spoke
and
the
guest
surveyed
and
listened
the
door
blew
shut
with
a
crash
outside
in
a
shed
billy
had
placed
the
wagon
between
himself
and
his
father
how
you
have
grown
the
man
was
saying
and
he
smiled
come
shake
hands
i
did
not
think
to
see
you
dare
you
to
touch
me
billy
screamed
no
i
never

with
you
lin
says
i
need
the
man
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
leaned
against
the
wheel
lord
lord
he
muttered
his
son
warily
slid
out
of
the
shed
and
left
him
leaning
there
part
ii
lin
mclean
bachelor
sat
out
in
front
of
his
cabin
looking
at
a
small
bright
pistol
that
lay
in
his
hand
he
held
it
tenderly
cherishing
it
and
did
not
cease
slowly
to
polish
it
revery
filled
his
eyes
and
in
his
whole
face
was
sadness
unmasked
because
only
the
animals
were
there
to
perceive
his
true
feelings
sunlight
and
waving
shadows
moved
together
upon
the
green
of
his
pasture
cattle
and
horses
loitered
in
the
opens
by
the
stream
down
box
elder
course
its
valley
and
bluffs
widened
away
into
the
level
and
the
blue
of
the
greater
valley
upstream
the
branches
and
shining
quiet
leaves
entered
the
mountains
where
the
rock
chimneys
narrowed
to
a
gateway
a
citadel
of
shafts
and
turrets
crimson
and
gold
above
the
filmy
emerald
of
the
trees
through
there
the
road
went
up
from
the
into
the
cool
quaking
asps
and
pines
and
so
across
the
range
and
away
to
separ
along
the
of
the
new
stable
two
hundred
yards
sat
mclean
turkeys
and
cocks
and
hens
walked
in
front
of
him
here
by
his
cabin
and
fenced
garden
slow
smoke
rose
from
the
cabin
chimney
into
the
air
in
which
were
no
sounds
but
the
running
water
and
the
afternoon
chirp
of
birds
amid
this
framework
of
a
home
the
sat
lonely
inattentive
polishing
the
treasured
weapon
as
if
it
were
not
already
long
clean
his
target
stood
some
twenty
steps
in
front
of
him
a
small
its
trunk
chipped
and
honeycombed
with
bullets
which
he
had
fired
into
it
each
day
for
memory
sake
presently
he
lifted
the
pistol
and
looked
at
its
name
the
word
neighbor
engraved
upon
it
i
wonder
said
he
aloud
if
she
keeps
the
rust
off
mine
then
he
lifted
it
slowly
to
his
lips
and
kissed
the
word
the
clank
of
wheels
sounded
on
the
road
and
he
put
the
pistol
quickly
down
dreaminess
vanished
from
his
face
he
looked
around
alertly
but
no
one
had
seen
him
the
clanking
was
still
among
the
trees
a
little
distance
up
box
elder
it
approached
deliberately
while
he
watched
for
the
vehicle
to
emerge
upon
the
open
where
his
cabin
stood
and
then
they
came
a
man
and
a
woman
at
sight
of
her
mclean
half
rose
but
sat
down
again
neither
of
them
had
noticed
him
sitting
as
they
were
in
silence
and
the
drowsiness
of
a
long
drive
the
man
was
with
good
looks
sallowed
by
dissipation
and
a
vanquished
glance
of
the
eye
as
the
woman
had
stood
on
the
platform
at
separ
so
she
sat
now
upright
bold
and
massive
the
brag
of
past
beauty
was
a
habit
settled
upon
her
stolid
features
both
sat
inattentive
to
each
other
and
to
everything
around
them
the
wheels
turned
slowly
and
with
a
dry
dead
noise
the
reins
bellied
loosely
to
the
shafts
the
horse
head
hung
low
so
they
drew
close
then
the
man
saw
mclean
and
color
came
into
his
face
and
went
away
said
he
clearing
his
throat
we
heard
you
was
in
the
noted
how
he
tried
to
smile
and
a
freakish
change
crossed
his
own
countenance
he
nodded
slightly
and
stretched
his
legs
out
as
he
sat
you
look
natural
said
the
woman
familiarly
seem
to
be
fixed
nice
here
continued
the
man

mclean

mclean

twitched
the
reins
mclean
levelled
a
pistol
at
a

and
knocked
off
its
head

suggested
very
distinctly

and

at

her
blue
staring

upon

mclean
he
picked
the
chickens
up
showed
the
woman
to
the
best
chair
in
his
room
and
went
into
his
kitchen
to
cook
supper
for
three
he
gave
his
guests
no
further
attention
nor
did
either
of
them
come
in
where
he
was
nor
did
the
husband
rejoin
the
wife
he
walked
slowly
up
and
down
in
the
air
and
she
sat
by
herself
in
the
room
lin
steps
as
he
made
ready
round
the
stove
and
table
and
lusk
slow
tread
out
in
the
setting
sunlight
were
the
only
sounds
about
the
cabin
when
the
host
looked
into
the
door
of
the
next
room
to
announce
that
his
meal
was
served
the
woman
sat
in
her
chair
no
longer
but
stood
with
her
back
to
him
by
a
shelf
she
gave
a
slight
start
at
his
summons
and
replaced
something
he
saw
that
she
had
been
examining
neighbor
and
his
face
hardened
suddenly
to
fierceness
as
he
looked
at
her
but
he
repeated
quietly
that
she
had
better
come
in
thus
did
the
three
sit
down
to
their
meal
occasionally
a
word
about
handing
some
dish
fell
from
one
or
other
of
them
but
nothing
more
until
lusk
took
out
his
watch
and
mentioned
the
hour

he
and
he
went
down
to
the
stable

the
crumbs
of
her
bread

a
cube
now
and
then
she
flattened
it
to
a
disk
mclean
seemed
to
have
nothing
that
he
wished
to
reply

trembling
as
he
watched
her
leaning
on
his
arms

second
best
lin
lin
i
laughed
at
them
words
of
mine
but
i
was
that
wound
up
i
was
strange
to
myself
and
she
me
that
way
and
i
says
to
her
second
best
will
not
be
the
crazy
thing
to

of

standing
in
her

he

tell
her
about

married
to
me
till

back
and
she
will
drop
me
out
of
sight
along
with
the
rest
that
went
nameless
they
was
not
uncomprehensible
to
you
was
they
you
have
learned
something
by
livin
i
guess
and
lin
your
lin
not
mine
nor
never
mine
in
heart
for
a
day
so
deep
as
he
yourn
right
now
he
has
been
gay
gay
as
any
i
knowed
why
look
at
that
face
of
his
could
a
boy
with
a
face
like
that
help
bein
gay
but
that
touch
what
the
true
lin
deep
down
nor
will
his
love
for
you
hinder
him
like
it
will
hinder
you
do
you
know
men
and
us
is
different
when
it
comes
to
passion
we
all
one
thing
then
but
they
ai
simple
they
keep
along
with
lots
of
other
things
i
ca
make
yus
know
and
i
guess
it
takes
a
woman
like
i
have
been
to
learn
their
nature
but
you
did
know
he
loved
you
and
you
sent
him
away
and
be
homeless
in
yer
house
when
he
has
done
the
right
thing
by
himself
and
found
another
girl
lin
all
the
while
i
was
talkin
all
i
knowed
to
her
without
what
i
be
sayin
next
for
it
come
that
unexpected
she
was
at
me
with
them
steady
eyes
and
all
she
says
when
i

was
i
saw
him

would
tell
him

she
tell

asked
the
lusk
laughed
oh

leave
separ
muttered
mclean
brooding
again
the
large
woman
laughed
out
but
more
harshly
i
have
kept
my
promise
lin
continued
keep
it
some
more
sit
here
rotting
in
your
chair
till
she
goes
away
maybe
she
what
that
said
lin
but
still
she
only
laughed
harshly
i
could
be
there
by
night
he
murmured
then
his
face
softened
she
would
never
do
such
a
thing
he
said
to
himself
he
had
forgotten
the
woman
at
the
table
while
she
had
told
him
matters
that
concerned
him
he
had
listened
eagerly
now
she
was
of
no
more
interest
than
she
had
been
before
her
story
was
begun
she
looked
at
his
eyes
as
he
sat
thinking
and
dwelling
upon
his
sweetheart
she
looked
at
him
and
a
longing
welled
up
into
her
face
a
certain
youth
and
heavy
beauty
relighted
the
features
you
are
the
same
same
lin
everyways
she
said
a
woman
is
too
many
for
you
still
lin
she
whispered
at
her
summons
he
looked
up
from
his
revery
lin
i
would
not
have
treated
you
the
caress
that
filled
her
voice
was
plain
his
look
met
hers
as
he
sat
quite
still
his
arms
on
the
table
then
he
took
his
turn
at
laughing
you
he
said
at
least
i
had
plenty
of
education
in
lin
lin
do
talk
that
brutal
to
me
if
yus
knowed
how
near
i
come
shooting
myself
with
that
would
have
been
funny
i
knowed
yus
wanted
to
tear

pistol
out
of

because
it
was
hern
but
yus
never
did

things
to
me

gentleman

you
somewheres

and
yus
did
never

not
even
when

to
know

well
and
when

so
unexpected

and
you
just
the
same
old
lin
scaring
lusk
with
shooting
them

so
comic
and
splendid
i
could
just

sittin
in
the
wagon
say
lin
what
made
yus
do
that
anyway
i
ca

the
only
noticing
him
so
turruble
anxious
to
quit
me
well
a
man

lin
you
was
always
a
comical
genius
lin
them

good
which
times

me
you
have
i
have
not
forgot
much
what
the
sense

this
yus

she
exclaimed
shucks
lin
lin
is
it
all
over
you
know
yus
loved
me
on
bear
creek
say
you
did
only
say
it
was
once
that
and
as
he
sat
she
came
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
for
a
moment
he
did
not
move
letting
himself
be
held
and
then
she
kissed
him
the
plates
crashed
as
he
beat
and
struck
her
down
upon
the
table
he
was
on
his
feet
cursing
himself
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
she
lay
where
she
had
fallen
beneath
his
fist
looking
after
him
and
smiling
mclean
walked
down
box
elder
creek
through
the
trees
toward
the
stable
where
lusk
had
gone
to
put
the
horse
in
the
wagon
once
he
leaned
his
hand
against
a
big
and
stood
still
with
eyes
then
he
continued
on
his
way
lusk
he
called
presently
and
in
a
few
steps
more
lusk
then
as
he
came
slowly
out
of
the
trees
to
meet
the
husband
he
began
with
quiet
evenness
your
wife
wants
to
know
but
he
stopped
no
husband
was
there
wagon
and
horse
were
not
there
the
door
was
shut
the
bewildered
looked
up
the
stream
where
the
road
went
and
he
looked
down
out
of
the
sky
where
daylight
and
stars
were
faintly
shining
together
sounded
the
long
cries
of
the
night
hawks
as
they
sped
and
swooped
to
their
hunting
in
the
dusk
from
among
the
trees
by
the
stream
floated
a
cooler
air
and
distant
and
close
by
sounded
the
splashing
water
about
the
meadow
where
lin
stood
his
horses
fed
quietly
crunching
he
went
to
the
door
looked
in
and
shut
it
again
he
walked
to
his
shed
and
stood
contemplating
his
own
wagon
alone
there
then
he
lifted
away
a
piece
of
trailing
vine
from
the
gate
of
the
corral
while
the
turkeys
moved
their
heads
and
watched
him
from
the
roof
a
rope
was
hanging
from
the
corral
and
seeing
it
he
dropped
the
vine
he
opened
the
corral
gate
and
walked
quickly
back
into
the
middle
of
the
field
where
the
horses
saw
him
and
his
rope
and
scattered
but
he
ran
and
herded
them
whirling
the
rope
and
so
drove
them
into
the
corral
and
flung
his
noose
over
two
he
dragged
two
saddles
saddles
from
the
stable
and
next
he
was
again
at
his
cabin
door
with
the
horses
saddled
she
was
sitting
quite
still
by
the
table
where
she
had
sat
during
the
meal
nor
did
she
speak
or
move
when
she
saw
him
look
in
at
the
door
lusk
has
gone
said
he
i
do
know
what
he
expected
you
would
do
or
i
would
do
but
we
will
catch
him
before
he
gets
to
she
looked
at
him
with
her
dumb
stare
gone
she
said
get
up
and
ride
said
mclean
you
are
going
to
drybone
she
echoed
her
voice
was
toneless
and
dull
he
made
no
more
explanations
to
her
but
went
quickly
about
the
cabin
soon
he
had
set
it
in
order
the
dishes
on
their
shelves
the
table
clean
the
fire
in
the
stove
arranged
and
all
these
movements
she
followed
with
a
sort
of
blank
mechanical
patience
he
made
a
small
bundle
for
his
own
journey
tied
it
behind
his
saddle
brought
her
horse
beside
a
stump
when
at
his
sharp
order
she
came
out
he
locked
his
cabin
and
hung
the
key
by
a
window
where
travellers
could
find
it
and
be
at
home
she
stood
looking
where
her
husband
had
slunk
off
then
she
laughed
it
about
his
size
she
murmured
her
old
lover
helped
her
in
silence
to
mount
into
the
man
saddle
this
they
had
often
done
together
in
former
years
and
so
they
took
their
way
down
the
silent
road
they
had
not
many
miles
to
go
and
after
the
first
two
lay
behind
them
when
the
horses
were
limbered
and
had
been
put
to
a
canter
they
made
time
quickly
they
had
soon
passed
out
of
the
trees
and
pastures
of
box
elder
and
came
among
the
vast
low
stretches
of
the
greater
valley
not
even
by
day
was
the
river
course
often
discernible
through
the
ridges
and
cheating
sameness
of
this
wilderness
and
beneath
this
of
stars
and
a
quarter
moon
the
sage
spread
shapeless
to
the
looming
mountains
or
to
nothing
i
will
ask
you
one
thing
said
lin
after
ten
miles
the
woman
made
no
sign
of
attention
as
she
rode
beside
him
did
i
understand
that
she
miss
buckner
i
mean
mentioned
she
might
be
going
away
from
separ
how
do
i
know
what
you
understood
i
thought
you
said
do
you
bother
me
lin
her
laugh
rang
out
loud
and
forlorn
one
brief
burst
that
startled
the
horses
and
that
must
have
sounded
far
across
the
you
men
are
rich
she
said
they
rode
on
side
by
side
and
saying
nothing
after
that
the
drybone
road
was
a
broad
trail
a
worn
strip
of
bareness
going
onward
over
the
endless
shelvings
of
the
plain
visible
even
in
this
light
and
presently
moving
upon
its
grayness
on
a
hill
in
front
of
them
they
made
out
the
wagon
they
hastened
and
overtook
it
put
your
carbine
down
said
mclean
to
lusk
it
not
robbers
your
wife
i
bringing
he
spoke
very
quietly
the
husband
addressed
no
word
to
the
get
in
then
he
said
to
his
wife
town
not
far
now
said
lin
maybe
you
would
prefer
riding
the
balance
of
the
way
i
but
the
note
of
pity
that
she
felt
in
mclean
question
overcame
her
and
her
utterance
choked
she
nodded
her
head
and
the
three
continued
slowly
climbing
the
hill
together
from
the
narrows
of
the
steep
sandy
banks
that
the
road
slanted
upward
through
for
a
while
they
came
out
again
upon
the
immensity
of
the
here
abruptly
like
an
ambush
was
the
whole
unsuspected
river
close
below
to
their
right
as
if
it
had
emerged
from
the
earth
with
a
circling
sweep
from
somewhere
out
in
the
gloom
it
cut
in
close
to
the
lofty
mesa
beneath
tall
descents
of
sand
smooth
as
a
railroad
embankment
as
they
paused
on
the
level
to
breathe
their
horses
the
wet
gulp
of
its
eddies
rose
to
them
through
the
stillness
upstream
they
could
make
out
the
light
of
the
drybone
bridge
but
not
the
bridge
itself
and
two
lights
on
the
farther
bank
showed
where
stood
the
opposite
drybone
they
went
on
over
the
and
reached
the
next
herald
of
the
town
chief
historian
the
graveyard
beneath
its
slanting
headboards
and
sand
lay
many
more
people
than
lived
in
drybone
they
passed
by
the
fence
of
this
shelterless
acre
on
the
hill
and
shoutings
and
high
music
began
to
reach
them
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
they
saw
the
sparse
lights
and
shapes
of
the
town
where
ended
the
gray
strip
of
road
the
many
sounds
feet
voices
and
music
grew
clearer
unravelling
from
their
muffled
confusion
and
the
fiddling
became
a
tune
that
could
be
known
there
a
dance
said
the
wife
to
the
husband
he
drove
as
he
had
been
driving
perhaps
he
had
not
heard
her
i
telling
you
to
hurry
she
repeated
my
new
dress
is
in
that
wagon
there
be
folks
to
welcome
me
here
that
older
friends
than
she
put
her
horse
to
a
gallop
down
the
broad
road
toward
the
music
and
the
older
friends
the
husband
spoke
to
his
horse
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
louder
cleared
his
throat
again
and
this
time
his
sullen
voice
carried
and
the
animal
started
so
lusk
went
ahead
of
lin
mclean
following
his
wife
with
the
new
dress
at
as
good
a
pace
as
he
might
if
he
did
not
want
her
company
perhaps
to
be
alone
with
the
was
still
less
to
his
mind
it
ai
only
her
he
stopped
caring
for
mused
lin
as
he
rode
slowly
along
he
do
care
for
himself
any
part
iii
drybone
has
altogether
returned
to
the
dust
even
in
that
day
its
hour
could
have
been
heard
beginning
to
sound
but
its
inhabitants
were
rather
deaf
gamblers
murderers
outlaws
male
and
female
all
were
so
busy
with
their
cards
their
lovers
and
their
bottles
as
to
make
the
place
seem
young
and
vigorous
but
it
was
second
childhood
which
had
set
in
drybone
had
known
a
wholesome
adventurous
youth
where
manly
lives
and
deaths
were
plenty
it
had
been
an
army
post
it
had
seen
horse
and
foot
and
heard
the
trumpet
brave
wives
had
kept
house
for
their
captains
upon
its
bluffs
winter
and
summer
they
had
made
the
best
of
it
when
the
war
department
ordered
the
captains
to
catch
indians
the
wives
bade
them
godspeed
when
the
interior
department
ordered
the
captains
to
let
the
indians
go
again
still
they
made
the
best
of
it
you
must
not
waste
indians
indians
were
a
source
of
revenue
to
so
many
people
in
washington
and
elsewhere
but
the
process
of
catching
indians
armed
with
weapons
sold
them
by
friends
of
the
interior
department
was
not
entirely
harmless
therefore
there
came
to
be
graves
in
the
drybone
graveyard
the
pale
told
all
about
it
sacred
to
the
memory
of
private
killed
on
the
dry
cheyenne
may
or
it
would
be
mrs
found
scalped
on
sage
but
even
the
financiers
at
washington
could
not
wholly
preserve
the
indian
in
drybone
neighborhood
as
the
cattle
by
ten
thousands
came
treading
with
the
next
step
of
civilization
into
this
huge
domain
the
soldiers
were
taken
away
some
of
them
went
west
to
fight
more
indians
in
idaho
oregon
or
arizona
the
battles
of
the
others
being
done
they
went
east
in
better
coffins
to
sleep
where
their
mothers
or
their
comrades
wanted
them
though
wind
and
rain
wrought
changes
upon
the
hill
the
graves
and
boxes
which
these
soldiers
left
behind
proved
heirlooms
as
serviceable
in
their
way
as
were
the
tenements
that
the
living
had
bequeathed
to
drybone
into
these
empty
barracks
came
to
dwell
and
do
business
every
joy
that
made
the
holiday
and
every
hunted
person
who
was
baffling
the
sheriff
for
the
sheriff
must
stop
outside
the
line
of
drybone
as
shall
presently
be
made
clear
the
captain
quarters
were
a
saloon
now
professional
cards
were
going
in
the
adjutant
office
night
and
day
and
the
commissary
building
made
a
good
and
hotel
instead
of
you
would
see
a
on
the
and
there
was
no
to
gather
up
the
broken
bottles
and
old
boots
heaps
of
these
choked
the
rusty
fountain
in
the
tufts
of
yellow
ragged
grass
that
dotted
the
place
plentifully
were
lodged
many
aces
and
queens
and
which
the
drybone
wind
had
blown
wide
from
the
doors
out
of
which
they
had
been
thrown
when
a
new
pack
was
called
for
inside
among
the
grass
tufts
would
lie
visitors
who
had
applied
for
beds
too
late
at
the
frankly
sleeping
their
whiskey
off
in
the
morning
air
above
on
the
hill
the
graveyard
quietly
chronicled
this
new
epoch
of
drybone
was
seldom
killed
very
far
out
of
town
and
of
course
scalping
had
disappeared
sacred
to
the
memory
of
johnston
accidently
shot
perhaps
one
is
still
there
unaltered
sacred
to
the
memory
of
ryan
babe
aged
two
this
unique
corpse
had
succeeded
in
dying
with
its
boots
off
but
a
succession
of
graves
was
not
always
needed
to
read
the
changing
tale
of
the
place
and
how
people
died
there
one
grave
would
often
be
enough
the
soldiers
of
course
had
kept
treeless
drybone
supplied
with
wood
but
in
these
latter
days
wood
was
very
scarce
none
grew
nearer
than
twenty
or
thirty
miles
none
that
is
to
make
boards
of
a
sufficient
width
for
epitaphs
and
twenty
miles
was
naturally
far
to
go
to
hew
a
board
for
a
man
of
whom
you
knew
perhaps
nothing
but
what
he
said
his
name
was
and
to
whom
you
owed
nothing
perhaps
but
a
trifling
poker
debt
hence
it
came
to
pass
that
headboards
grew
into
a
sort
of
directory
they
were
light
to
lift
from
one
place
to
another
a
single
coat
of
white
paint
would
wipe
out
the
first
tenant
name
sufficiently
to
paint
over
it
the
next
comer
by
this
thrifty
habit
the
original
boards
belonging
to
the
soldiers
could
go
round
keeping
pace
with
the
new
civilian
population
and
though
at
first
sight
you
might
be
puzzled
by
the
layers
of
names
still
visible
beneath
the
white
paint
you
could
be
sure
that
the
clearest
and
blackest
was
the
one
to
which
the
present
tenant
had
answered
so
there
on
the
hill
lay
the
graveyard
steadily
writing
history
and
making
that
history
lay
the
town
at
the
bottom
one
thin
line
of
houses
framing
three
sides
of
the
old
parade
ground
in
these
slowly
rotting
shells
people
rioted
believing
the
golden
age
was
here
the
age
when
everybody
should
have
money
and
nobody
should
be
arrested
for
drybone
soil
you
see
was
still
government
soil
not
yet
handed
over
to
wyoming
and
only
government
could
arrest
there
and
only
for
government
crimes
but
government
had
gone
and
seldom
worried
drybone
the
spot
was
a
of
sanctuary
pasted
in
the
middle
of
wyoming
big
map
a
paradise
for
the
johnstons
only
you
must
not
steal
a
horse
that
was
really
wicked
and
brought
you
instantly
to
the
notice
of
drybone
one
official
the
coroner
for
they
did
keep
a
coroner
judge
slaghammer
he
was
perfectly
illegal
and
lived
next
door
in
albany
county
but
that
county
paid
fees
and
mileage
to
keep
tally
of
drybone
casualties
his
wife
owned
the
and
between
their
industries
they
made
out
a
living
and
all
the
citizens
made
out
a
living
the
happy
on
ranches
far
and
near
still

and
instantly
spent
the
high
wages
still
paid
them
with
their
bodies
full
of
youth
and
their
pockets
full
of
gold
they
rode
into
town
by
twenties
by
fifties
and
out
again
next
morning
penniless
always
and
happy
and
then
the
johnstons
would
sit
with
each
other
till
the
innocents
should
come
to
town
again
the
innocents
had
certainly
come
to
town
and
drybone
was
furnishing
to
them
all
its
joys
their
many
horses
stood
tied
at
every
post
and
corner
patient
experienced
well
knowing
it
was
an
affair
the
talk
and
laughter
of
the
riders
was
in
the
saloons
they
leaned
joking
over
the
bars
they
sat
behind
their
cards
at
the
tables
they
strolled
to
the
to
buy
presents
for
their
easy
sweethearts
their
boots
were
keeping
audible
time
with
the
fiddle
at
slaghammer
from
the
multitude
and
vigor
of
the
sounds
there
the
dance
was
being
done
regularly
regularly
meant
that
upon
the
conclusion
of
each
set
the
gentleman
led
his
lady
to
the
bar
and
invited
her
to
choose
and
it
was
also
regular
that
the
lady
should
choose
beer
and
whiskey
were
the
alternatives
lin
mclean
horse
took
him
across
the
square
without
guiding
from
the
who
sat
absently
with
his
hands
folded
upon
the
horn
of
his
saddle
this
horse
too
was
patient
and
experienced
and
could
not
know
what
remote
thoughts
filled
his
master
mind
he
looked
around
to
see
why
his
master
did
not
get
off
lightly
as
he
had
done
during
so
many
gallant
years
and
hasten
in
to
the
conviviality
but
the
lonely
sat
mechanically
identifying
the
horses
of
acquaintances
toothpick
kid

here
said
he
and
limber
jim
and
the
doughie

after
the
trouble

i
expect
that

said
a
hearty
voice
mclean
eagerly
turned
for
the
moment
his
face
lighted
from
its
sombreness
i
forgot
you
be
here
said
he
and
he
sprang
to
the
ground
it
fine
to
see
go
home
repeated
the
governor
of
wyoming
shaking
his
ancient
friend
hand
you
in
drybone
and
claim
you
reformed
yu
seem
to
be
on
hand
yourself
said
the
bracing
to
be
jocular
if
he
could
me
i
gone
fishing
do
you
read
the
papers
if
we
poor
governors
ca
lock
up
the
state
house
and
take
a
whirl
now
and
then
doc
interrupted
lin
it
plumb
fine
to
see
yu
again
he
shook
hands
why
yes
we
met
here
before
you
and
his
excellency
the
hon
amory
barker
stood
laughing
familiar
and
genial
his
sound
white
teeth
shining
but
behind
his
round
spectacles
he
scrutinized
mclean
for
in
this
second
was
a
fervor
that
seemed
a
grasp
a
reaching
out
for
comfort
barker
had
passed
through
separ
though
an
older
acquaintance
than
billy
he
had
asked
jessamine
fewer
and
different
questions
but
he
knew
what
he
knew
well
drybone
the
same
old
drybone
said
he
hole
of
iniquity
let
see
how
you
walk
lin
took
a
few
steps
pooh
i
said
you
never
get
over
and
his
excellency
beamed
with
professional
pride
in
his
doctor
days
barker
had
set
the
boy
leg
and
before
it
was
properly
knit
the
boy
had
escaped
from
the
hospital
to
revel
loose
in
drybone
on
such
another
night
as
this
soon
he
had
been
carried
back
with
the
fracture
split
open
again
it
shows
does
it
said
lin
well
it
do
usually
not
except
when
i
when
i
down
suggested
his
excellency
yes
doc
down
the
confessed
barker
looked
into
his
friend
clear
hazel
eyes
beneath
their
dauntless
sparkle
was
something
that
touched
the
governor
good
heart
i
got
some
whiskey
along
on
the
trip
eastern
whiskey
said
he
come
over
to
my
room
i
used
to
sleep
all
night
onced
said
mclean
as
they
went
then
i
come
to
know
different
but
i
never
have
believed
just
mere
thoughts
could
make
yu
make
yu
feel
like
the
steam
was
only
half
on
i
eat
yu
know
he
stated
suddenly
and
i
expect
one
or
two
in
camp
lately
have
not
found
my
muscle
lacking
feel
me
barker
dutifully
obeyed
and
praised
the
excellent
sinews
across
from
the
the
whining
of
the
fiddle
came
high
and
gay
feet
blurred
the
talk
of
voices
and
voices
rose
above
the
trampling
of
feet
here
and
there
some
lurking
form
stumbled
through
the
dark
among
the
rubbish
and
clearest
sound
of
all
the
light
crack
of
billiard
balls
reached
dry
and
far
into
the
night
barker
contemplated
the
stars
and
calm
splendid
dimness
of
the
plain
every
prospect
pleases
and
only
man
is
vile
he
quoted
but
do
tell
the
republican
party
i
said
it
awful
true
though
doc
i
vile
myself
yu
do
know
why
i
did
know
and
then
they
sat
down
to
confidences
and
whiskey
for
so
long
as
the
world
goes
round
a
man
must
talk
to
a
man
sometimes
and
both
must
drink
over
it
the
unburdened
himself
to
the
governor
and
the
governor
filled
up
his
friend
glass
with
the
eastern
whiskey
and
nodded
his
spectacles
and
listened
and
advised
and
said
he
should
have
done
the
same
and
like
the
good
governor
that
he
was
never
remembered
he
was
governor
at
all
with
political
friends
here
who
had
begged
a
word
or
two
he
became
just
barker
again
the
young
hospital
surgeon
the
hospital
that
now
stood
a
ruin
and
lin
was
again
his
patient
lin
the
of
nineteen
reckless
engaging
disobedient
his
leg
broken
and
his
heart
light
with
no
jessamine
or
conscience
to
rob
his
salt
of
its
savor
while
he
now
told
his
troubles
the
quadrilles
fiddled
away
careless
as
ever
and
the
crack
of
the
billiard
balls
sounded
as
of
old
nobody
has
told
you
about
this
i
expect
said
the
lover
he
brought
forth
the
little
pistol
he
did
not
hand
it
across
to
barker
but
walked
over
to
barker
chair
and
stood
holding
it
for
the
doctor
to
see
when
barker
reached
for
it
to
see
better
since
it
was
half
hidden
in
the
big
hand
lin
yielded
it
to
him
but
still
stood
and
soon
drew
it
back
i
take
it
around
he
said
and
when
one
of
those
stories
comes
along
like
there
plenty
of
that
she
wants
to
get
rid
of
me
i
just
kind
o
take
a
look
at
when
i
off
where
it
handy
and
it
busts
the
story
right
out
of
my
mind
i
have
to
tell
you
what
a
fool
i
the
whiskey
your
side
said
barker
go
but
doc
my
courage
has
quit
me
they
see
what
i
thinking
about
just
like
i
was
a
tenderfoot
trying
his
first
bluff
i
ca
stick
it
out
no
more
and
i
going
to
see
her
come
what
will
i
got
to
i
going
to
ride
right
up
to
her
window
and
shoot
off
and
if
she
do
come
out
i
know
a
knocking
came
at
the
governor
room
and
judge
slaghammer
entered
not
been
to
our
dance
governor
said
he
the
governor
thought
that
perhaps
he
was
tired
that
perhaps
this
evening
he
must
forego
the
pleasure
it
may
be
wiser
in
your
position
it
may
be
advisable
said
the
coroner
they
getting
on
rollers
over
there
we
do
not
like
trouble
in
drybone
but
trouble
comes
to
us
as
shooting
suggested
his
excellency
recalling
his
hospital
practice
well
governor
you
know
how
it
is
our
boys
are
as
as
any
in
this
western
country
you
know
governor
those
generous
spirits
are
ever
ready
for
especially
after
slaghammer
whiskey
remarked
the
governor
the
coroner
shot
a
shrewd
eye
at
wyoming
chief
executive
it
was
not
politically
harmonious
to
be
reminded
that
but
for
his
wife
liquor
a
number
of
fine
young
men
with
nothing
save
youth
untrained
and
health
the
matter
with
them
would
be
riding
their
horses
instead
of
sleeping
on
the
hill
but
the
coroner
wanted
support
in
the
next
campaign
boys
will
be
boys
said
he
they
ai
pulled
any
guns
but
i
come
away
though
some
of
making
up
pretty
free
to
lusk
it
ai
suitable
for
me
to
see
too
much
lusk
says
after
you
he
mentioned
incidentally
to
lin
he
fillin
up
and
says
he
after
mclean
nodded
placidly
and
with
scant
politeness
he
wished
this
visitor
would
go
but
judge
slaghammer
had
noticed
the
whiskey
he
filled
himself
a
glass
governor
it
has
my
compliments
said
he
ambrosier
mrs
slaghammer
seems
to
have
a
large
gathering
said
barker
good
boys
good
boys
the
judge
blew
importantly
and
waved
his
arm
all
spending
generous
governor
once
more
ambrosier
he
settled
himself
deep
in
a
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
mclean
rose
abruptly
said
he
i
going
to
separ
exclaimed
slaghammer
rousing
slightly
oh
stay
with
us
stay
with
he
closed
his
eyes
again
but
sustained
his
smile
of
office
you
know
how
well
i
wish
you
said
barker
to
lin
i
just
see
you
forthwith
the
friends
left
the
coroner
quiet
beside
his
glass
and
walked
toward
the
horses
through
drybone
gaping
quadrangle
the
dead
ruins
loomed
among
the
lights
of
the
and
always
the
keen
jockey
cadences
of
the
fiddle
sang
across
the
night
but
a
calling
and
confusion
were
set
up
and
the
tune
broke
off
just
like
old
times
said
his
excellency
where
the
it
was
where
it
should
be
close
by
and
the
two
stepped
behind
it
to
be
screened
from
wandering
bullets
a
man
do
forget
his
habits
declared
the
governor
makes
me
feel
young
makes
me
feel
old
said
mclean
hark
sounds
like
my
name
said
barker
they
listened
oh
yes
of
course
that
it
they
shouting
for
the
doctor
but
we
just
spare
them
a
minute
or
so
to
finish
their
i
did
hear
any
shooting
said
mclean
it
something
as
they
waited
no
shots
came
but
still
the
fiddle
was
silent
and
the
murmur
of
many
voices
grew
in
the
while
single
voices
wandered
outside
calling
the
doctor
name
i
the
governor
on
a
said
he
but
it
to
be
done
i
they
left
their
and
proceeded
over
to
the
dance
the
musician
sat
high
and
solitary
upon
two
fiddle
on
knee
staring
and
waiting
half
the
floor
was
bare
on
the
other
half
the
revellers
were
densely
clotted
at
the
crowd
outer
rim
the
young
horsemen
flushed
and
swaying
retained
their
gaudy
dance
partners
strongly
by
the
waist
to
be
ready
when
the
music
should
resume
what
is
it
they
asked
who
is
it
and
they
looked
in
across
heads
and
shoulders
inattentive
to
the
caresses
which
the
partners
gave
them
lusk
was
who
it
was
and
she
had
taken
poison
here
in
their
midst
after
many
dances
and
drinks
here
doc
cried
an
older
one
here
doc
chorused
the
young
blood
that
had
come
into
this
country
since
his
day
and
the
throng
caught
up
the
words
here
doc
doc
in
a
moment
mclean
and
barker
were
sundered
from
each
other
in
this
flood
barker
sucked
in
toward
the
centre
but
often
eddied
back
by
those
who
meant
to
help
him
heard
the
mixed
explanations
pass
his
ear
unfinished
versions
contradictions
a
score
of
facts
it
had
been
it
had
been
rough
on
it
had
been
something
in
a
bottle
there
was
little
steering
in
this
clamorous
sea
but
barker
reached
his
patient
where
she
sat
in
her
new
dress
hailing
him
with
wild
inebriate
gayety
i
must
get
her
to
her
room
friends
said
he
he
must
get
her
to
her
room
went
the
word
leave
doc
get
her
to
her
and
they
tangled
in
their
eagerness
around
him
and
his
patient
give
us
girls
shouted
lusk
girls
you
fiddler
we
come
back
said
barker
to
her
girls
i
tell
yus
ho
there
no
sense
looking
at
that
bottle
doc
take
yer
dance
while
there
time
she
was
holding
the
chair
help
him
said
the
crowd
help
they
took
her
from
her
chair
and
she
fought
a
big
pink
mass
of
ribbons
fluttering
and
wrenching
itself
among
them
she
has
six
ounces
of
laudanum
in
her
barker
told
them
at
the
top
of
his
voice
it
wo
wait
all
i
a
whirlwind
said
lusk
that
my
game
and
you
done
your
share
she
cried
to
the
fiddler
here
my
regards
old
man
girls
once
more
she
flung
out
her
hand
and
from
it
fell
notes
and
coins
rolling
and
ringing
around
the
starch
boxes
some
dragged
her
on
while
some
fiercely
forbade
the
musician
to
touch
the
money
because
it
was
hers
and
she
would
want
it
when
she
came
to
thus
they
gathered
it
up
for
her
but
now
she
had
sunk
down
asking
in
a
new
voice
where
was
lin
mclean
and
when
one
grinning
intimate
reminded
her
that
lusk
had
gone
to
shoot
him
she
laughed
out
richly
and
the
crowd
joined
her
mirth
but
even
in
the
midst
of
the
joke
she
asked
again
in
the
same
voice
where
was
lin
mclean
he
came
beside
her
among
more
jokes
he
had
kept
himself
near
and
now
at
sight
of
him
she
reached
out
and
held
him
tell
them
to
leave
me
go
to
sleep
lin
said
she
barker
saw
a
chance
persuade
her
to
come
along
said
he
to
mclean
minutes
are
counting
oh
i
come
she
said
with
a
laugh
overhearing
him
and
holding
still
to
lin
the
rest
of
the
old
friends
nudged
each
other
back
seats
for
us
they
said
but
we
had
our
turn
in
front
then
thinking
they
would
be
useful
in
encouraging
her
to
walk
they
clustered
again
rendering
barker
and
mclean
once
more
helpless
clumsily
the
escort
made
its
slow
way
across
the
quadrangle
cautioning
itself
about
stones
and
holes
thus
presently
she
was
brought
into
the
room
the
escort
set
her
down
crowding
the
little
place
as
thick
as
it
would
hold
the
rest
gathered
thick
at
the
door
and
all
of
them
had
no
thought
of
departing
the
notion
to
stay
was
plain
on
their
faces
barker
surveyed
them
give
the
doctor
a
show
now
boys
said
he
you
done
it
all
so
far
do
crowd
my
elbows
i
want
you
he
whispered
to
mclean
at
the
argument
of
obedience
swept
over
them
like
a
veering
of
wind
do
crowd
his
elbows
they
began
to
say
at
once
and
told
each
other
to
come
away
we
sure
give
the
doc
room
you
do
want
to
be
shovin
your
auger
in

to
get

pretty
near
the
room
thinned
of
them
forthwith
fix
her
up
good
doc
they
said
over
their
shoulders
they
shuffled
across
the
threshold
and
porch
with
roundabout
schemes
to
tread
quietly
when
one
or
other
stumbled
on
the
steps
and
fell
he
was
jerked
to
his
feet
you
want
to
tame
yourself
was
the
word
then
suddenly
chalkeye
and
toothpick
kid
came
precipitately
back
her
cash
they
said
and
leaving
the
notes
and
coins
they
hastened
to
catch
their
comrades
on
the
way
back
to
the
dance
i
want
you
repeated
barker
to
mclean
him
cried
lusk
flashing
alert
again
jessamine
wants
him
about
now
i
guess
do
keep
him
from
his
girl
and
she
laughed
her
hard
rich
laugh
looking
from
one
to
the
other
not
the
two
of
yus
save
me
she
stated
defiantly
but
even
in
these
last
words
a
sort
of
thickness
sounded
walk
her
up
and
down
said
barker
keep
her
moving
i
look
what
i
can
find
keep
her
moving
at
once
he
was
out
of
the
door
and
before
his
running
steps
had
died
away
the
fiddle
had
taken
up
its
tune
across
the
quadrangle
girls
exclaimed
the
woman
old
times
old
times
come
said
mclean
and
he
took
her
her
head
was
full
of
the
music
forgetting
all
but
that
she
went
with
him
easily
and
the
two
made
their
first
turns
around
the
room
whenever
he
brought
her
near
the
entrance
she
leaned
away
from
him
toward
the
open
door
where
the
old
fiddle
tune
was
coming
in
from
the
dark
but
presently
she
noticed
that
she
was
being
led
and
her
face
turned
sullen
walk
said
mclean
do
you
think
so
said
she
laughing
but
she
found
that
she
must
go
with
him
thus
they
took
a
few
more
turns
you
hurting
me
she
said
next
then
a
look
of
drowsy
cunning
filled
her
eyes
and
she
fixed
them
upon
mclean
dogged
face
he
gone
lin
she
murmured
raising
her
hand
where
barker
had
disappeared
she
knew
mclean
had
heard
her
and
she
held
back
on
the
quickened
pace
that
he
had
set
leave
me
down
you
hurt
she
pleaded
hanging
on
him
the
put
forth
more
strength
just
the
floor
she
pleaded
again
just
one
minute
on
the
floor
he
think
you
could
not
keep
me
still
mclean
made
no
answer
but
steadily
led
her
round
and
round
as
he
had
undertaken
he
playing
out
she
exclaimed
you
be
played
out
she
laughed
herself
the
man
drew
a
breath
and
she
laughed
more
to
feel
his
hand
and
arm
strain
to
surmount
her
increasing
resistance
jessamine
she
whispered
to
him

at

ache
was
numbing

arms

he
slung
me
off
but
he
had
to
sling
you
ca
stop
her
head
was
rolling
while
the
lips
smiled
her
words
came
through
deeper
and
deeper
veils
fearless
defiant
a
challenge
inarticulate
a
continuous
mutter
again
he
looked
at
the
door
as
he
struggled
to
move
with
her
dragging
weight
the
drops
rolled
on
his
forehead
and
neck
his
shirt
was
wet
his
hands
slipped
upon
her
ribbons
suddenly
the
drugged
body
folded
and
sank
with
him
pulling
him
to
his
knees
while
he
took
breath
so
the
mutter
went
on
and
through
the
door
came
the
jigging
fiddle
a
fire
of
desperation
lighted
in
his
eyes
buffalo
girls
he
shouted
hoarsely
in
her
ear
and
got
once
more
on
his
feet
with
her
as
though
they
were
two
partners
in
a
quadrille
still
shouting
her
to
wake
he
struck
a
tottering
sort
of
step
and
so
with
the
bending
load
in
his
grip
strove
feebly
to
dance
the
laudanum
away
feet
stumbled
across
the
porch
and
lusk
was
in
the
room
so
i
got
you
he
said
he
had
no
weapon
but
made
a
dive
under
the
bed
and
came
up
with
a
carbine
the
two
men
locked
wrenching
impotently
and
fell
together
the
carbine
loud
shot
rang
in
the
room
but
did
no
harm
and
mclean
lay
sick
and
panting
upon
lusk
as
barker
rushed
in
thank
god
said
he
and
flung
lusk
pistol
down
the
man
deranged
and
encouraged
by
drink
had
come
across
the
doctor
delayed
him
threatened
him
with
his
pistol
and
when
he
had
torn
it
away
had
left
him
suddenly
and
vanished
but
barker
had
feared
and
come
after
him
here
he
glanced
at
the
woman
slumbering
motionless
beside
the
two
men
the
husband
brief
courage
had
gone
and
he
lay
beneath
mclean
who
himself
could
not
rise
barker
pulled
them
apart
lin
boy
you
not
hurt
he
asked
affectionately
and
lifted
the
mclean
sat
passive
with
dazed
eyes
letting
himself
be
supported
you
not
hurt
repeated
barker
no
answered
the
slowly
i
guess
he
looked
about
the
room
and
at
the
door
i
got
interrupted
he
said
you
be
all
right
soon
said
barker
nobody
cares
for
me
cried
lusk
suddenly
and
took
to
querulous
weeping
get
up
ordered
barker
sternly
do
accuse
me
governor
screamed
lusk
i
and
he
rose
barker
looked
at
the
woman
and
then
at
the
husband
i
not
say
there
was
much
chance
for
her
he
said
but
any
she
had
is
gone
through
you
she
nobody
cares
for
me
repeated
the
man
he
has
learned
my
boy
to
scorn
he
ran
out
aimlessly
and
away
into
the
night
leaving
peace
in
the
room
stay
sitting
said
barker
to
mclean
and
went
to
lusk
but
the
seeing
him
begin
to
lift
her
toward
the
bed
without
help
tried
to
rise
his
strength
was
not
sufficiently
come
back
and
he
sank
as
he
had
been
i
guess
i
do
amount
to
much
said
he
i
feel
like
i
was
well
i
something
said
barker
coming
back
to
his
friend
out
of
breath
and
i
know
what
she
he
stared
admiringly
through
his
spectacles
at
the
seated
man
the
eyes
slowly
travelled
over
his
body
and
then
sought
barker
face
doc
said
he
ai
i
young
to
have
my
nerve
quit
me
this
way
his
excellency
broke
into
his
broad
smile
i
know
i
racketed
some
but
ai
it
ruther
early
pursued
mclean
wistfully
you
infant
said
barker
look
at
your
lin
stared
at
it
the
fingers
quivering
and
bloody
and
the
skin
grooved
raw
between
them
that
was
the
buckle
of
her
belt
which
in
the
struggle
had
worked
round
and
been
held
by
him
unknowingly
both
his
wrists
and
his
shirt
were
ribbed
with
the
pink
of
her
sashes
he
looked
over
at
the
bed
where
lay
the
woman
heavily
breathing
it
was
a
something
a
sound
not
like
the
breath
of
life
and
barker
saw
the
shudder
she
is
strong
he
said
her
system
will
fight
to
the
end
two
hours
yet
maybe
queer
world
he
moralized
people
half
killing
themselves
to
keep
one
in
it
who
wanted
to
go
and
one
that
nobody
wanted
to
stay
mclean
did
not
hear
he
was
musing
his
eyes
fixed
absently
in
front
of
him
i
would
not
want
he
said
with
hesitating
utterance
not
wish
for
even
my
enemy
to
have
a
thing
like
what
i
had
to
do
barker
touched
him
on
the
arm
if
there
had
been
another
man
i
could
trust
trust
broke
in
the
why
doc
it
is
the
best
turn
ever
done
me
i
know
i
am
a
man
now
if
my
nerve
ai
i
known
you
were
a
man
since
i
knew
you
said
the
hearty
governor
and
he
helped
the
still
unsteady
to
a
chair
as
for
your
nerve
i
bring
you
some
whiskey
now
and
after
he
glanced
at
the
bed
and
tomorrow
you
go
try
if
miss
jessamine
wo
put
the
nerve
yes
doc
i
go
there
i

but
do

while
she
i
going
to
be
glad
about
this
doc
after
awhile
but
at
the
sight
of
a
in
the
door
he
stopped
in
what
his
soul
was
stammering
to
say
what
do
you
want
judge
he
inquired
coldly
i
understand
began
slaghammer
to
barker
i
am
informed
speak
quieter
judge
said
the
i
understand
repeated
slaghammer
more
official
than
ever
that
there
was
a
case
for
the
you
be
notified
put
in
mclean
again
meanwhile
you
talk
quiet
in
this
slaghammer
turned
and
saw
the
breathing
mass
on
the
bed
you
are
a
little
early
judge
said
barker
but
but
your
ten
dollars
are
safe
said
mclean
the
coroner
shot
one
of
his
shrewd
glances
at
the
and
sat
down
with
an
amiable
countenance
his
fee
was
indeed
ten
dollars
and
he
was
desirous
of
a
second
term
under
the
apprehension
that
it
had
already
occurred
the
misapprehension
i
took
steps
to
impanel
a
jury
said
he
addressing
both
barker
and
mclean
they
are
ah
waiting
outside
responsible
men
governor
and
have
sat
before
drybone
has
few
responsible
men
but
i
procured
these
at
a
little
game
where
they
were
ah
losing
you
may
go
back
gentlemen
said
he
going
to
the
door
i
will
summon
you
in
proper
he
looked
in
the
room
again
is
the
husband
not
intending
that
enough
judge
said
mclean
there
too
many
here
without
adding
judge
spoke
a
voice
at
the
door
ai
she
ready
yet
she
is
still
passing
away
observed
slaghammer
piously
because
i
was
thinking
said
the
man
i
was
just
you
see
us
jury
is
dry
and
dead
broke
doggonedest
cards
i
held
this
year
and
judge
would
there
be
anything
out
of
the
way
in
me
touching
my
fee
in
advance
if
it
a
sure
thing
i
see
none
my
friend
said
slaghammer
benevolently
since
it
must
he
shook
his
head
and
nodded
it
by
turns
then
with
importance
he
sat
again
and
wrote
a
paper
his
coroner
certificate
next
door
in
albany
county
these
vouchers
brought
their
face
value
of
five
dollars
to
the
holder
but
on
drybone
neutral
soil
the
saloons
would
always
pay
four
for
them
and
it
was
rare
that
any
could
withstand
the
temptation
of
four
immediate
dollars
this
one
gratefully
received
his
paper
and
cherishing
it
like
a
bird
in
the
hand
he
with
his
colleagues
bore
it
where
they
might
wait
for
duty
and
slake
their
thirst
in
the
silent
room
sat
lin
mclean
his
body
coming
to
life
more
readily
than
his
shaken
spirit
barker
seeing
that
the
meant
to
watch
until
the
end
brought
the
whiskey
to
him
slaghammer
drew
documents
from
his
pocket
to
fill
the
time
but
was
soon
in
slumber
over
them
in
all
precincts
of
the
quadrangle
drybone
was
keeping
it
up
late
the
fiddle
the
occasional
shouts
and
the
crack
of
the
travelled
clear
and
far
through
the
vast
darkness
outside
presently
steps
unsteadily
drew
near
and
round
the
corner
of
the
door
a
voice
plaintive
and
diffident
said
judge
ai
she
most
pretty
near
ready
wake
up
judge
said
barker
your
jury
has
gone
dry
the
man
appeared
round
the
door
a
handsome
dishevelled
fellow
with
hat
in
hand
balancing
himself
with
respectful
anxiety
thus
was
a
second
voucher
made
out
and
the
messenger
strayed
back
happy
to
his
friends
barker
and
mclean
sat
wakeful
and
slaghammer
fell
at
once
to
napping
from
time
to
time
he
was
roused
by
new
messengers
each
arriving
more
unsteady
than
the
last
until
every
juryman
had
got
his
fee
and
no
more
messengers
came
the
coroner
slept
undisturbed
in
his
chair
mclean
and
barker
sat
on
the
bed
the
mass
with
its
pink
ribbons
breathed
and
breathed
while
moths
flew
round
the
lamp
tapping
and
falling
with
light
sounds
so
did
the
heart
of
the
darkness
wear
itself
away
and
through
the
air
the
dawn
began
to
filter
and
expand
barker
rose
bent
over
the
bed
and
then
stood
seeing
him
mclean
stood
also
judge
said
barker
quietly
you
may
call
them
and
with
careful
steps
the
judge
got
himself
out
of
the
room
to
summon
his
jury
for
a
short
while
the
stood
looking
down
upon
the
woman
she
lay
lumped
in
her
gaudiness
the
ribbons
darkly
stained
by
the
laudanum
but
into
the
stolid
bold
features
death
had
called
up
the
ghost
of
youth
and
mclean
remembered
all
his
bear
creek
days
hind
sight
is
a
turruble
clear
way
o
seein
things
said
he
i
think
take
a
go
said
barker
the
jury
only
need
me
and
i
join
but
the
jury
needed
no
witness
their
long
waiting
and
the
advance
pay
had
been
too
much
for
these
responsible
men
like
brothers
they
had
shared
each
others
vouchers
until
responsibility
had
melted
from
their
brains
and
the
whiskey
was
finished
then
no
longer
entertained
and
growing
weary
of
drybone
they
had
remembered
nothing
but
their
distant
beds
each
had
mounted
his
pony
holding
trustingly
to
the
saddle
and
thus
unguided
the
experienced
ponies
had
taken
them
right
across
the
wide
sagebrush
and
up
and
down
the
river
they
were
now
asleep
or
riding
dispersed
irrevocably
but
the
coroner
was
here
he
duly
received
barker
testimony
brought
his
verdict
in
and
signed
it
and
even
while
he
was
issuing
to
himself
his
own
proper
voucher
for
ten
dollars
came
chalkeye
and
toothpick
kid
on
their
ponies
galloping
eager
in
their
hopes
and
good
wishes
for
lusk
life
ran
strong
in
them
both
the
night
had
gone
well
with
them
here
was
the
new
day
going
to
be
fine
it
must
be
well
with
everybody
you
do
say
they
exclaimed
taken
aback
too
they
sat
still
in
their
saddles
and
upon
their
reckless
kindly
faces
thought
paused
for
a
moment
her
gone
they
murmured
hard
to
get
used
to
the
idea
what
anybody
doing
about
the
coffin
mr
lusk
answered
slaghammer
doubtless
lusk
he
not
know
anything
this
forenoon
he
out
there
in
the
grass
she
did
think
nothing
of
him
tell
bill
not
dollar
bill
jerky
bill
yu
know
he
over
the
bridge
to
fix
up
a
hearse
and
we
be
the
two
drove
their
spurs
in
with
vigorous
heels
and
instantly
were
gone
rushing
up
the
road
to
the
graveyard
the
fiddle
had
lately
ceased
and
no
dancers
stayed
any
longer
in
the
hall
eastward
the
rose
and
gold
began
to
flow
down
upon
the
plain
over
the
tops
of
the
distant
hills
of
the
revellers
many
had
never
gone
to
bed
and
many
now
were
already
risen
from
their
excesses
to
revive
in
the
cool
glory
of
the
morning
some
were
drinking
to
stay
their
hunger
until
breakfast
some
splashed
and
sported
in
the
river
calling
and
joking
and
across
the
river
some
were
holding
upon
the
level
beyond
the
drybone
air
rang
with
them
their
lusty
wandering
shouts
broke
out
in
gusts
of
hilarity
their
pistols
aimed
at
cans
or
prairie
dogs
or
anything
cracked
as
they
galloped
at
large
their
speeding
forms
would
shine
upon
the
bluffs
and
descending
merge
in
the
dust
their
horses
had
raised
yet
all
this
was
nothing
in
the
vastness
of
the
growing
day
beyond
their
voices
the
rim
of
the
sun
moved
above
the
violet
hills
and
drybone
amid
the
quiet
long
new
fields
of
radiance
stood
august
and
strange
down
along
the
tall
bare
slant
from
the
graveyard
the
two
horsemen
were
riding
back
they
could
be
seen
across
the
river
and
the
grew
curious
as
more
and
more
watched
the
crowd
began
to
speak
it
was
a
calf
the
two
were
bringing
it
was
too
small
for
a
calf
it
was
dead
it
was
a
coyote
they
had
roped
see
it
swing
see
it
fall
on
the
road
it
a
coffin
boys
said
one
shrewd
at
guessing
at
that
the
event
of
last
night
drifted
across
their
memories
and
they
wheeled
and
spurred
their
ponies
their
crowding
hoofs
on
the
bridge
brought
the
swimmers
from
the
waters
below
and
dressing
they
climbed
quickly
to
the
plain
and
followed
the
gathering
by
the
door
already
were
jerky
bill
and
limber
jim
and
the
doughie
and
always
more
dashing
up
with
their
ponies
halting
with
a
sharp
scatter
of
gravel
to
hear
and
comment
barker
was
gone
but
the
important
coroner
told
his
news
and
it
amazed
each
comer
and
set
him
speaking
and
remembering
past
things
with
the
others
dead
each
one
began
her

the
best
you
could
do

so
said
toothpick

choices
are
getting
scarce
up
there
said
chalkeye
we
looked
the
lot
they
were
arriving
from
their
search
among
the
old
graves
on
the
hill
now
they
descended
from
their
ponies
with
the
box
roped
and
rattling
between
them
where
your
hearse
jerky
asked
chalkeye
have
her
round
in
a
minute
said
the
cowboy
and
galloped
away
with
three
or
four
others
turruble
lonesome
coffin
all
the
same
repeated
the
doughie
and
they
surveyed
the
box
that
had
once
held
some
soldier
she
did
like
fixin
said
limber
jim
fixin
said
toothpick
kid
that
while
some
six
of
them
with
chalkeye
bore
the
light
coffin
into
the
room
many
followed
toothpick
kid
to
the
store
breaking
in
here
they
found
men
sleeping
on
the
counters
these
had
been
able
to
find
no
other
beds
in
drybone
and
lay
as
they
had
stretched
themselves
on
entering
they
sprawled
in
heavy
slumber
some
with
not
even
their
hats
taken
off
and
some
with
their
boots
against
the
rough
hair
of
the
next
one
they
were
quickly
pushed
together
few
waking
and
so
there
was
space
for
spreading
cloth
and
chintz
stuffs
were
unrolled
and
flung
aside
till
many
folds
and
colors
draped
the
motionless
sleepers
and
at
length
a
choice
was
made
unmeasured
yards
of
this
drab
chintz
were
ripped
off
money
treble
its
worth
was
thumped
upon
the
counter
and
they
returned
bearing
it
like
a
streamer
to
the
coffin
while
the
noise
of
their
hammers
filled
the
room
the
hearse
came
tottering
to
the
door
pulled
and
pushed
by
twenty
men
it
was
an
ambulance
left
behind
by
the
soldiers
and
of
the
shape
concave
in
body
its
top
blown
away
in
winds
of
long
ago
and
as
they
revolved
its
wheels
dished
in
and
out
like
hoops
about
to
fall
while
some
made
a
harness
from
ropes
and
throwing
the
saddles
off
two
ponies
backed
them
to
the
vehicle
the
body
was
put
in
the
coffin
now
covered
by
the
chintz
but
the
laudanum
upon
the
front
of
her
dress
revolted
those
who
remembered
their
holidays
with
her
and
turning
the
woman
upon
her
face
they
looked
their
last
upon
her
flashing
colored
ribbons
and
nailed
the
lid
down
so
they
carried
her
out
but
the
concave
body
of
the
hearse
was
too
short
for
the
coffin
the
end
reached
out
and
it
might
have
fallen
but
limber
jim
taking
the
reins
sat
upon
the
other
end
waiting
and
smoking
for
all
drybone
was
making
ready
to
follow
in
some
way
they
had
sought
the
husband
the
chief
mourner
he
however
still
lay
in
the
grass
of
the
quadrangle
and
despising
him
as
she
had
done
they
left
him
to
wake
when
he
should
choose
those
men
who
could
sit
in
their
saddles
rode
escort
the
old
friends
nearest
and
four
held
the
heads
of
the
frightened
who
were
to
draw
the
hearse
they
had
never
known
harness
before
and
they
plunged
with
the
men
who
held
them
behind
the
hearse
the
women
followed
in
a
large
this
moment
arrived
in
town
two
mares
drew
this
and
their
foals
gambolled
around
them
the
great
dray
for
hauling
poles
came
last
with
its
four
government
mules
the
had
caught
sight
of
it
and
captured
it
rushing
to
the
they
carried
the
sleeping
men
from
the
counter
and
laid
them
on
the
dray
then
searching
drybone
outside
and
in
for
any
more
incapable
of
following
they
brought
them
and
the
dray
was
piled
limber
jim
called
for
another
drink
and
with
his
cigar
between
his
teeth
cracked
his
long
whip
the
ponies
terrified
sprang
away
scattering
the
men
that
held
them
and
the
swaying
hearse
leaped
past
the
husband
over
the
stones
and
the
many
in
the
grass
masterfully
steered
it
came
safe
to
an
open
level
while
the
throng
cheered
the
unmoved
driver
on
his
coffin
his
cigar
between
his
teeth
stay
with
it
jim
they
shouted
you
a
king
a
steep
ditch
lay
across
the
flat
where
he
was
veering
abrupt
and
nearly
hidden
but
his
eye
caught
the
danger
in
time
and
swinging
from
it
leftward
so
that
two
wheels
of
the
leaning
coach
were
in
the
air
he
faced
the
open
again
safe
as
the
rescue
swooped
down
upon
him
the
horsemen
came
at
the
ditch
a
body
of
daring
a
sultry
blast
of
youth
wheeling
at
the
brink
they
turned
whirling
their
long
ropes
the
skilful
nooses
flew
and
the
ponies
caught
by
the
neck
and
foot
were
dragged
back
to
the
quadrangle
and
held
in
line
so
the
pageant
started
the
wild
ponies
quivering
but
subdued
by
the
tightened
ropes
and
the
coffin
steady
in
the
ambulance
beneath
the
driver
the
escort
in
their
fringed
leather
and
broad
hats
moved
slowly
beside
and
behind
it
many
of
them
swaying
their
faces
full
of
health
and
the
sun
and
the
strong
drink
the
women
followed
whispering
a
little
and
behind
them
the
slow
dray
jolted
with
its
heaps
of
men
waking
from
the
depths
of
their
whiskey
and
asking
what
this
was
so
they
went
up
the
hill
when
the
riders
reached
the
tilted
gate
of
the
graveyard
they
sprang
off
and
scattered
among
the
hillocks
stumbling
and
eager
they
nodded
to
barker
and
mclean
quietly
waiting
there
and
began
choosing
among
the
open
graves
from
which
the
soldiers
had
been
taken
their
figures
went
up
and
down
the
uneven
ridges
calling
and
comparing
here
said
the
doughie
here
a
good
here
a
deep
one
said
another
we
struck
a
well
here
said
some
more
put
her
in
the
became
clamorous
with
voices
until
they
arrived
at
a
choice
when
some
one
with
a
spade
quickly
squared
the
opening
with
lariats
looping
the
coffin
round
they
brought
it
and
were
about
to
lower
it
when
chalkeye
too
near
the
edge
fell
in
and
one
end
of
the
box
rested
upon
him
he
could
not
rise
by
himself
and
they
pulled
the
ropes
helplessly
above
mclean
spoke
to
barker
i
like
to
stop
this
said
he
but
a
man
might
as
well
might
as
well
stop
a
said
barker
yes
doc
but
it
feels
it
feels
like
i
was
looking
at
ten
dozen
lin
and
seeing
them
still
helpless
with
chalkeye
he
joined
them
and
lifted
the
out
i
think
said
slaghammer
stepping
forward
this
should
proceed
no
further
without
some
perhaps
some
friend
would
recite
i
lay
me
they
do
use
that
on
funerals
said
the
doughie
will
some
gentleman
give
the
lord
prayer
inquired
the
coroner
foreheads
were
knotted
triad
mutterings
ran
among
them
but
some
one
remembered
a
prayer
book
in
one
of
the
rooms
in
drybone
and
the
notion
was
hailed
four
mounted
and
raced
to
bring
it
they
went
down
the
hill
in
a
flowing
knot
shirts
ballooning
and
elbows
flapping
and
so
returned
but
the
book
was
beyond
them
take
it
you
you
take
it
each
one
said
false
beginnings
were
made
big
thumbs
pushed
the
pages
back
and
forth
until
impatience
conquered
them
they
left
the
book
and
lowered
the
coffin
helped
again
by
mclean
the
weight
sank
slowly
decently
steadily
down
between
the
banks
the
sound
that
it
struck
the
bottom
with
was
a
slight
sound
the
grating
of
the
load
upon
the
solid
sand
and
a
little
sand
strewed
from
the
edge
and
fell
on
the
box
at
the
same
moment
the
rattle
came
up
from
below
compact
and
brief
a
single
jar
quietly
smiting
through
the
crowd
smiting
it
to
silence
one
removed
his
hat
and
then
another
and
then
all
they
stood
eying
each
his
neighbor
and
shifting
their
eyes
looked
away
at
the
great
valley
then
they
filled
in
the
grave
brought
a
from
a
grave
near
by
and
wrote
the
name
and
date
upon
it
by
scratching
with
a
stone
she
was
sure
one
of
us
said
chalkeye
let
give
her
the
and
they
followed
his
lead
once
in
the
saddle
i
used
to
go
dashing
once
in
the
saddle
i
used
to
go
gay
first
took
to
drinking
and
then
to
got
shot
in
the
body
and
now
here
i
lay
beat
the
drum
slowly
play
the
fife
lowly
sound
the
dead
march
as
you
bear
me
along
take
me
to
and
throw
the
sod
over
me
i
but
a
poor
i
know
i
done
when
the
song
was
ended
they
left
the
graveyard
quietly
and
went
down
the
hill
the
morning
was
growing
warm
their
work
waited
them
across
many
sunny
miles
of
range
and
plain
soon
their
voices
and
themselves
had
emptied
away
into
the
splendid
vastness
and
silence
and
they
were
gone
ready
with
all
their
might
to
live
or
to
die
to
be
animals
or
heroes
as
the
hours
might
bring
them
opportunity
in
drybone
deserted
quadrangle
the
sun
shone
down
upon
lusk
still
sleeping
and
the
wind
shook
the
aces
and
kings
in
the
grass
part
iv
over
at
separ
jessamine
buckner
had
no
more
stockings
of
billy
to
mend
and
much
time
for
thinking
and
a
change
of
mind
the
day
after
that
strange
visit
when
she
had
been
told
that
she
had
hurt
a
good
man
heart
without
reason
she
took
up
her
work
and
while
her
hands
despatched
it
her
thoughts
already
accused
her
could
she
have
seen
that
visitor
now
she
would
have
thanked
her
she
looked
at
the
photograph
on
her
table
why
did
he
go
away
so
quickly
she
sighed
but
when
young
billy
returned
to
his
questions
she
was
buoyant
again
and
more
than
a
match
for
him
he
reached
the
forbidden
twelfth
time
of
asking
why
lin
mclean
did
not
come
back
and
marry
her
nor
did
she
punish
him
as
she
had
threatened
she
looked
at
him
confidentially
and
he
drew
near
full
of
hope
billy
i
tell
you
just
why
it
is
said
she
lin
thinks
i
not
a
real
a
ah
drawled
billy
backing
from
her
with
suspicion
indeed
that
what
it
is
billy
if
he
knew
i
was
a
real
girl
a
ah
went
the
boy
entirely
angry
anybody
can
tell
you
a
and
he
marched
out
mystified
and
nursing
a
sense
of
wrong
nor
did
his
dignity
allow
him
to
reopen
the
subject
two
miles
out
in
the
by
himself
he
was
shooting
but
began
suddenly
to
run
in
toward
separ
a
horseman
had
passed
him
and
he
had
loudly
called
but
the
rider
rode
on
intent
upon
the
little
distant
station
man
and
horse
were
soon
far
ahead
of
the
boy
and
the
man
came
into
town
galloping
no
need
to
fire
the
little
pistol
by
her
window
as
he
had
once
thought
to
do
she
was
outside
before
he
could
leap
to
the
ground
and
as
he
held
her
she
could
only
laugh
and
cry
and
say
forgive
me
oh
why
have
you
been
so
long
she
took
him
back
to
the
room
where
his
picture
was
and
made
him
sit
and
sat
herself
close
what
is
it
she
asked
him
for
through
the
love
she
read
something
else
in
his
serious
face
so
then
he
told
her
how
nothing
was
wrong
and
as
she
listened
to
all
that
he
had
to
tell
she
too
grew
serious
and
held
very
close
to
him
dear
dear
neighbor
she
said
as
they
sat
so
happy
with
deepening
happiness
but
not
gay
yet
young
billy
burst
open
the
door
there
he
cried
i
knowed
lin
knowed
you
were
a
girl
thus
did
billy
also
have
his
wish
for
had
he
not
told
jessamine
that
he
liked
her
and
urged
her
to
come
and
live
with
him
and
lin
that
cabin
on
box
elder
became
a
home
in
truth
with
a
woman
inside
taking
the
only
care
of
mclean
that
he
had
known
since
his
childhood
though
singularly
enough
he
has
an
impression
that
it
is
he
who
takes
care
of
jessamine
in
the
the
black
pines
stand
high
up
the
hills
the
white
snow
sifts
their
columns
deep
while
through
the
canyon
riven
cleft
from
there
beyond
the
rose
clouds
sweep
serene
above
their
paling
shapes
one
star
hath
wakened
in
the
sky
and
here
in
the
gray
world
below
over
the
sage
the
wind
blows
by
rides
through
the
and
hums
aloft
a
sturdy
tune
among
the
river
tawny
bluffs
untenanted
as
is
the
moon
far
the
huge
invading
dusk
comes
silence
awful
through
the
plain
but
yonder
horseman
heart
is
gay
and
he
goes
singing
might
and
main
