left
bent

friend
and
alfred
me
to
introduce
this
of
old
work
in
a
new
his
have
to
say
that
nearly
all
the
numbers
contained
in
the
present
volume
are
reprinted
book
of
the
first
of
these
i
have
removed
some
copies
of
verse
which
seemed
to
me
scarce
worth
i
have
recovered
for
it
certain
others
from
those
publications
which
had
made
room
for
have
corrected
where
i
such
dates
as
i
and
my
best
to
give
my
as
it
final
any
be
displeased
by
the
can
but
submit
that
my
verses
are
my
that
this
is
how
i
would
have
them
work

revision
has
reminded
me
as
is
this
book
of
is
all
in
the
matter
of
verse
that
i
have
to
show
for
the
years
principal
reason
is
spending
the
better
part
of
my
life
in
the
pursuit
of
found
utterly
unmarketable
that
i
had
to
own
myself
beaten
in
to
addict
myself
to
journalism
for
the
next
ten
the
production
by
my
old
his
little
collection
for
that
hospital
to
which
he
has
devoted
so
much
time
and
energy
and
those
unrhyming
rhythms
in
which
i
had
tried
to
scarce
can
do
in

of

old

long
been

agèd

you

gentlemen
my

life
is
brittle
you
carry
cæsar
and
his
v
operation
you
are
carried
in
a
basket
like
a
carcase
from
the
shambles
to
the
theatre
a
cockpit
where
they
stretch
you
on
a
table
then
they
bid
you
close
your
eyelids
and
they
mask
you
with
a
napkin
and
the
anæsthetic
reaches
hot
and
subtle
through
your
being
and
you
gasp
and
reel
and
shudder
in
a
rushing
swaying
rapture
while
the
voices
at
your
elbow
lights
about
you
shower
and
tumble
and
your
blood
seems
edged
and
vibrant
yet
within
you
racked
and
hurried
back
and
forward
then
the
lights
grow
fast
and
furious
and
you
hear
a
noise
of
waters
and
you
wrestle
blind
and
dizzy
in
an
agony
of
effort
till
a
sudden
lull
accepts
you
and
you
sound
an
utter
darkness
and
awaken
with
a
struggle
on
a
hushed
attentive
audience
vi
after
like
as
a
flamelet
blanketed
in
smoke
so
through
the
anæsthetic
shows
my
life
so
flashes
and
so
fades
my
thought
at
strife
with
the
strong
stupor
that
i
heave
and
choke
and
sicken
at
it
is
so
foully
sweet
faces
look
strange
from
disappear
far
voices
sudden
loud
offend
my
and
hush
as
sudden
then
my
senses
fleet
all
were
a
blank
save
for
this
dull
new
pain
that
grinds
my
leg
and
foot
and
brokenly
time
and
the
place

to
me
again

unsurprised

of
uncertainty

vii
vigil
lived
on
one
s
back
in
the
long
hours
of
repose
life
is
a
practical
hideous
asleep
or
awake
shoulders
and
loins
ache
ache
and
the
mattress
run
into
boulders
and
hummocks
glows
like
a
kiln
while
the
tumbling
importunate
ramble
and
roll
and
the
gas
screwed
to
its
lowermost
an
inevitable
atom
of
light
haunts
and
a
stertorous
sleeper
snores
me
to
hate
and
despair
all
the
old
time
surges
malignant
before
me
old
voices
old
kisses
old
songs
blossom
derisive
about
me
while
the
new
days
pass
me
in
endless
procession
a
pageant
of
shadows
silently
leeringly
wending
on
and
still
on
still
on
far
in
the
stillness
a
cat
languishes
loudly
a
cinder
falls
and
the
shadows
lurch
to
the
leap
of
the
flame
the
next
man
to
me
turns
with
a
moan
and
the
snorer
the
drug
like
a
rope
at
his
throat
gasps
gurgles
snorts
himself
free
as
the
noiseless
and
strange
her
bull
s
eye
in
apron
whispering
me
are
ye
no
sleepin
yet
passes
and
peering
round
and
is
gone
sleep
comes
at
sleep
full
of
dreams
and
broken
with
brutal
and
sordid
voices
and
sounds
that
impose
on
me
ere
i
can
wake
to
it

unnatural
intolerable
day

paint
her
all
to
you

ease

antique
liveliness
and
ponderous
grace
the
sweet
old
roses
of
her
sunken
face
the
depth
and
malice
of
her
sly
grey
eyes
the
broad
scots
tongue
that
flatters
scolds
defies
the
thick

that
fells
you
like

thirty

comely
shape
a
slim
hand
graced
rather
oddly
with
a
signet

becoming
everything

at

her

mystery

nerving
you
here
at

anyhow
surging
along

and
whiskers

and
they
ring
themselves
round
the

where
the
chief
his
dressers
and
clerks
at
attention
bends
in
inspection
already
so
shows
the
ring
seen
from

round
a

doing
his
pitch
in

street
high
shoulders
low
shoulders
broad
shoulders
narrow

round
square
and
angular

and
shove
while
from

a

gravely
and

fluent
sounds

then
ceases
and
suddenly
look
at
the
stress
of
the
shoulders
out
of
a
quiver
of
silence
over
the
hiss
of
the
spray
comes
a
low
cry
and
the
sound
of
breath
quick
intaken
through
teeth
clenched
in
resolve
and
the
master
breaks
from
the
crowd
and
goes
wiping
his
hands
to

his
pupils
flocking
and
whispering

his

passed
with
him
where
he
passed

thrones
and
dominations
glaived

plumed
and
mailed
thronged
in
the
streets
the
palaces
with
domes
cloisters
dungeons
caverns
tents
arcades
of
the
unseen
silent
city
in
his
soul
pavilioned
jealously
and
hid
as
in
the
dusk
profound
green
stillnesses
of
some
enchanted
i
shut
mine
eyes
and
lo
a
flickering
snatch
of
memory
that
floats
upon
the
face
of
a
pool
of
darkness
five
and
thirty
dead
years
deep
antic
in
girlish
broideries
and
skirts
and
silly
shoes
with
straps
and
a

plain
in
the
shadow
of
a
church
michael

in
whose
brazen
call
to
curfew
his
first
wails
of
wrath
were
whelmed
sedate
for
all
his
haste
to
be
at
home
and
nestled
in
his
arm
inciting
still
to
quiet
and
solitude
boarded
in
sober
drab
with
small
square
agitating
cuts
let
in
of
the
close
quakerlike
print
a
book
what
but
that
blessed
brief
of
what
is
gallantest
and
best
in
all
the
libraries
of
romance
the
book
of
rocs
sandalwood
ivory
turbans
ambergris
and
lettered
apes
and
calendars
and

curled
about
a

of
the
breed
of
that
live
ladder
by
whose
delicate
rungs
you
climbed
beyond
the
clouds
and
found
the
where
the
ogre
gorged
and
drowsy
from
his
great
oak
chair
among
the
flitches
and
pewters
at
the
fire
called
for
his
faëry
harp
and
in
it
flew
and
perching
on
the
kitchen
table
sang
jocund
and
jubilant
with
a
sound
of
those
gay
madrigals
the
shy
thrush
at
flutes
from
wet
orchards
flushed
with
the
triumphing
dawn
or
blackbirds
rioting
as
they
listened
still
in
woodlands
rapt
with
an
spring
for
pan
s
own
whistle
savage
and
rich
and
lewd
and
mocked
him
call
for
call
i
could
not
pass
the
where
the
cobbler
sat
in
view
nor
figure
me
the
wizen
leprechaun
in
faded
reds
and
bent
at
his
work
in
the
and
know
just
how
he
tapped
his
brogue
and
twitched
his
this
and
that
way
both
with
wrists
and
elbows
in
the
rich
june
fields
where
the
ripe
clover
drew
the
bees
and
the
tall
quakers
trembled
and
the
west
wind
lolled
his
away
beside
me
lolling
and
lounging
through
my
own
twas
good
to
follow
the
miller
s
youngest
son
on
his
white
horse
along
the
leafy
lanes
for
at
his
stirrup
linked
and
ran
not
cynical
and
trapesing
as
he
loped
from
wall
to
wall
above
the
espaliers
but
in
the
bravest
tops
that
a
town
of
tops
could
show
bold
subtle
adventurous
his
tail
a
banner
flaunted
in
disdain
of
human
stratagems
and
shifts
king
over
all
the
catlands
present
and
past
and
future
that
moustached
artificer
of
fortunes
or
bluebeard
s
closet
with
its
plenishing
of
sawdust
blood
and
wives
that
hung
like
most
a
butcher
s
part
a
faëry
chamber
hazily
seen
and
hazily
dark
afternoons
and
windy
nights
was
visiting
of
the
best
then
too
the
pelt
of
hoofs
out
in
the
roaring
darkness
told
of
herne
the
hunter
in
his
antlered
helm
galloping
as
with
despatches
from
the
pit
between
his
hounds
and
rip
van
winkle
often
i
lurked
to
hear
outside
the
long
low
timbered
tarry
wall
the
mutter
and
rumble
of
the
trolling
bowls
down
the
lean
plank
before
they
fluttered
the
pins
for
listening
i
could
help
him
play
his
wonderful
game
in
those
blue
booming
hills
with
mariners
refreshed
from
kegs
not
coopered
in
this
our
world
but
what
were
these
so
near
so
neighbourly
fancies
to
the
spell
that
brought
the
run
of
ali
baba
s
cave
just
for
the
saying
open
sesame
with
gold
to
measure
peck
by
peck
in
round
brown
wooden
stoups
you
borrowed
at
the
chandler
s
or
one
time
made
you
aladdin
s
friend
at
school
free
of
his
garden
of
jewels
ring
and
lamp
in
perfect
trim
or
ladies
fair
for
all
the
embrowning
scars
in
their
white
breasts
went
labouring
under
some
dread
ordinance
which
made
them
whip
and
bitterly
cry
the
while
strange
curs
that
cried
as
they
till
there
was
never
a
black
bitch
of
all
your
consorting
but
might
have
gone
miserably
for
crimes
done
in
the
pride
of
womanhood
and
desire
or
at
the
ghostliest
altitudes
of
night
while
you
lay
wondering
and
acold
your
sense
was
fearfully
purged
and
soon
queen
labé
abominable
and
dear
rose
from
your
side
opened
the
box
of
doom
scattered
the
yellow
powder
which
i
saw
like
sulphur
at
the
docks
in
bulk
and
muttered
certain
words
you
could
not
hear
and
there
a
living
stream
the
brook
you
bathed
in
with
its
weeds
and
flags
and
cresses
glittered
and
sang
out
of
the
hearthrug
over
the
nakedness
and
decent
of
your
bedroom
floor
i
many
a
time
that
second
calendar
son
of
a
king
on
whom
twas
vehemently
enjoined
pausing
at
one
mysterious
door
to
pry
no
closer
but
content
his
soul
with
his
kind
forty
yet
i
could
not
rest
for
idleness
and
ungovernable
fate
and
the
black
horse
which
fed
on
sesame
that
word
vouchsafed
his
back
to
me
and
spread
his
vans
and
soaring
soaring
on
from
air
to
air
came
charging
to
the
ground
sheer
like
a
lark
from
the
midsummer
clouds
and
shaking
me
out
of
the
saddle
where
i
sprawled
flicked
at
me
with
his
tail
and
left
me
blinded
miserable
distraught
even
as
i
was
in
deed
when
doctors
came
and
odious
things
were
done
on
my
poor
tortured
eyes
with
lancets
or
some
evil
acid
stung
and
wrung
them
like
hot
sand
and
desperately
from
room
to
room
fumble
i
must
my
dark
disconsolate
way
to
get
to
bagdad
how
i
might
but
there
i
met
with
merry
ladies
o
you
safie
amine
my
heart
forgets
you
all
shall
be
forgot
and
so
we
supped
we
and
the
rest
on
wine
and
roasted
lamb
dates
almonds
pistachios
citrons
and
haroun
laughed
out
of
his
lordly
beard
on
giaffar
and
mesrour
knew
the
three
for
all
their
mossoul
habits
and
outside
the
tigris
flowing
swift
like
severn
bend
for
bend
twinkled
and
gleamed
with
broken
and
wavering
shapes
of
stranger
stars
the
vast
blue
night
was
murmurous
with
peris
plumes
and
the
leathern
wings
of
genies
words
of
power
were
whispering
and
old
fishermen
casting
their
nets
with
prayer
might
draw
to
shore
dead
loveliness
or
a
prodigy
in
scales
worth
in
the
caliph
s
kitchen
pieces
of
gold
or
copper
vessels
stopped
with
lead
wherein
some
squire
of
eblis
watched
and
railed
in
durance
under
potent
charactry
graven
by
the
seal
of
solomon
the
king
then
as
the
book
was
glassed
in
life
as
in
some
olden
mirror
s
quaint
bewildering
angles
so
would
life
flash
light
on
light
back
on
the
book
and
both
were
changed
once
in
a
house
decayed
from
better
days
harbouring
an
errant
show
for
all
its
stories
of
were
filled
with
gruesome
visitants
in
wax
inhuman
hushed
ghastly
with
painted
eyes
i
wandered
and
no
living
soul
was
nearer
than
the
and
i
stared
upon
them
till
at
last
three
sets
of
rafters
from
the
streets
i
strayed
upon
a
mildewed
room
with
the
two
dancers
horrible
and
obscene
guarding
the
door
and
there
in
a
behind
a
fence
of
faded
crimson
cords
with
an
aspect
of
frills
and
dimities
and
dishonoured
privacy
that
made
you
hanker
and
hesitate
to
look
a
woman
with
her
litter
of
slain
all
in
their
nightgowns
all
with
painted
eyes
staring
so
that
i
turned
and
ran
as
for
my
neck
but
in
the
street
took
breath
the
same
it
seemed
and
yet
not
all
the
same
i
was
to
find
as
i
went
up
for
afterwards
whenas
i
went
my
round
all
day
long
stern
silent
streets
where
i
might
stretch
my
hand
and
take
whatever
i
would
still
there
were
shapes
of
stone
motionless
lifelike
the
wrath
had
smitten
them
but
they
watched
this
by
her
melons
and
figs
that
by
his
rings
and
chains
and
watches
with
the
hideous
gaze
the
painted
eyes
insufferable
now
of
those
grisly
images
and
i
pursued
my
quest
thrilled
with
a
novel
and
delicious
fear
so
the
night
never
a
lamplighter
and
through
the
palace
of
the
king
i
groped
among
the
echoes
and
i
felt
that
they
were
there
dreadfully
there
the
painted
staring
eyes
hall
after
hall
till
lo
from
far
a
voice
and
in
a
little
while
two
tapers
burning
and
the
voice
heard
in
the
wondrous
word
of
god
whose
but
zobëidé
s
the
lady
of
my
heart
like
me
a
true
believer
and
like
me
an
outcast
thousands
of
leagues
beyond
the
pale
or
sailing
to
the
isles
of
khaledan
i
spied
one
evenfall
a
black
blotch
in
the
sunset
and
it
grew
swiftly
and
grew
tearing
their
beards
the
sailors
wept
and
prayed
but
the
grave
ship
deep
laden
with
spiceries
and
pearls
went
mad
wrenched
the
long
tiller
out
of
the
steersman
s
hand
and
turning
broadside
on
as
the
most
iron
would
was
haled
and
sucked
nearer
and
nearer
yet
and
all
awash
with
horrible
lurching
leaps
rushed
at
that
portent
casting
a
shadow
now
that
swallowed
sea
and
sky
and
then
anchors
and
nails
and
bolts
flew
screaming
out
of
her
and
with
clang
on
clang
a
noise
of
fifty
stithies
caught
at
the
sides
of
the
magnetic
mountain
and
she
lay
a
broken
bundle
of
firewood
strown
piecemeal
about
the
waters
and
her
crew
passed
shrieking
one
by
one
and
i
was
left
to
drown
all
the
long
night
i
swam
but
in
the
morning
o
the
smiling
coast
tufted
with
meadowlike
skirted
with
shelving
sands
and
a
great
wave
cast
me
ashore
and
i
was
saved
alive
so
giving
thanks
to
god
i
dried
my
clothes
and
faring
inland
in
a
desert
place
i
stumbled
on
an
iron
the
fellow
of
fifty
built
into
the
quays
when
scenting
a
i
dug
and
dug
until
my
biggest
blade
stuck
into
wood
and
then
the
flight
of
stairs
sunk
in
the
naked
rock
the
cool
clean
vault
so
neat
with
niche
on
niche
it
might
have
been
our
but
for
the
rows
of
brazen
urns
like
monstrous
chemist
s
jars
full
to
the
wide
squat
throats
with
but
a
layer
of
things
i
knew
for
olives
and
far
o
far
away
the
princess
of
china
languished
far
away
was
marriage
with
a
vizier
and
a
chief
of
eunuchs
and
the
privilege
of
going
out
at
night
to
majestical
where
the
old
brown
friendly
river
shaped
like
tigris
shore
for
shore
haply
a
ghoul
sat
in
the
churchyard
under
a
frightened
moon
a
thighbone
in
his
fist
and
glared
at
supper
with
a
lady
she
who
took
her
rice
with
tweezers
grain
by
grain
or
you
might
by
the
iron
gates
of
the
pump
the
upon
bedreddin
in
his
shirt
and
drawers
just
as
the
civil
genie
laid
him
down
or
those
panes
whence
a
tame
cornet
tenored
it
throatily
of
and
spittoons
and
new
long
pipes
might
turn
a
caravansery
s
wherein
you
found
noureddin
ali
loftily
drunk
and
that
fair
persian
bathed
in
tears
you
d
not
have
given
away
for
all
the
diamonds
in
the
vale
perilous
you
had
that
dark
and
disleaved
afternoon
escaped
on
a
roc
s
claw
disguised
like
in
christmas
beef
and
all
the
blissful
while
the
schoolboy
satchel
at
your
hip
was
such
a
bulse
of
gems
as
should
amaze
chapmen
drawn
from
over
caspian
yea
the
chief
jewellers
of
tartary
and
the
bazaars
seething
with
traffic
of
enormous
thus
cried
thus
called
aloud
to
the
child
heart
the
magian
east
thus
the
child
eyes
spelled
out
the
wizard
message
by
the
light
of
the
sober
workaday
hours
they
saw
week
in
week
out
pass
and
still
pass
in
the
sleepy
minster
city
folded
kind
in
ancient
severn
s
arm
amongst
her
and
her
docks
whose
floating
populace
of
galliots
and
luggers
brigantines
bluff
barques
and
to
her
very
doorsteps
and
geraniums
the
scents
of
the
world

end
the
calls
that
may
not
be
gainsaid
to
rise
and
ride
like
fire
on
some
high
errand
of
the
race
the
irresistible
appeals
for
comradeship
that
sound
steadily
from
the
irresistible
sea
thus
the
east
laughed
and
whispered

the

itself
anew

looks
the

i
come
where
a
living
casement
laughs
luminous
and
wide
i
hear
the
song
of
a
piano
break
in
a
sparkling
tide

i
feel
in
the
waltz
that
frolics
and
warbles
swift
and
clear
a
sudden
sense
of
shelter
and
friendliness
and
cheer
a
sense

tinkling
glasses
of

laughter

the

stops

the

stares
blank
out
into
the
night
the
blind
goes
out

wander
to
the

at

along

brought
many
a
rounded
grace
more
near
so
passing
one
with
wave
and

she
left
for
memory
to
caress
a
laughing
thought
a
golden
gleam
a
hint
of
hidden
loveliness

let

from

dim
underworld
to

these
terrene

their
twilight
sets
when
dispossessed
of

they
stand
beggared
and

to
all

for
stooks
of

the

hour
his
silent
shining
sorcery
winged
with
power
still
still
the
streets
between
their
carcanets
of
linking
gold
are
avenues
of
sleep
but
see
how
gable
ends
and
parapets
in
gradual
beauty
and
significance
emerge
and
did
you
hear
that
little
breaking
inordinately
loud
and
clear
on
this
still
spectral
exquisite
atmosphere
tis
a
first
nest
at

furtive
and

a
spent
witch
homing
from
some
infamous
obscene
see
her
tip
and
fade
through
shadowy
railings
into
a
pit
of
shade
and
now
a
little
wind
and
shy
the
smell
of
ships
that
earnest
of
romance
a
sense
of
space
and
water
and
thereby
a
lamplit
bridge
ouching
the
troubled
sky
and
look
o
look
a
tangle
of
silver
gleams
and
dusky
lights
our
river
and
all
his
dreams
his
dreams
that
never

in
our
deaths
can
die
what
miracle
is
happening
in
the
air
charging
the
very
texture
of
the
gray
with
something
luminous
and
rare
the
night
goes
out
like
an
fire
and
as
one
lights
a
candle
it
is
day
the
extinguisher
that
perks
it
like
a
spire
on

formal
church

not

green
across

the
nigher
the
the
how
clean
how
new
how
naked
see
the
batch
of
boats
here
at
the
stairs
washed
in
the
beam

those
are
barges
that
were
goblin
floats
black
fraught
with
devilry
and
dream
and
in
the
piles
the
water
frolics
clear
the
ripples
into
loose
rings
wander
and
flee
and
can
behold
that
could
but
hear
the
ancient
river
singing
as
he
goes
in
morning
to
the
ancient
sea
the
gas
burns
lank
and
jaded
in
its
glass
the
old
ruffian
soon
shall
yawn
himself
awake
and
light
his
pipe
and
shoulder
his
tools
and
take
his
hobnailed
way
to
work

us
too
pass
ere
the
sun
leaps
and
your
shadow
through
these
long
blindfold

staring

with
his
gaze
turned
inward
on
some
piece
of

by
the
great
pass
to
an
exquisite
night

more
exquisite
close
reach
upon

of

these
colonies
of

and
as
we
steal
homeward
together
but
for
the
buxom
breeze
fitfully
frolicking
to
heel
with
news
of
woods
and
tumbling
seas
we
awed
thus
lonely
that
we
be
wandering
some
dispeopled
star
some
world
of
memories
and
unbroken
graves
so
broods
the
abounding
silence
near
and
far
till
even
your
footfall
craves
forgiveness
of
the
majesty
it
braves
iii
down
through
the
ancient
strand
the
spirit
of
october
mild
and
boon
and
sauntering
takes
his
way
this
golden
end
of
afternoon
as
though
the
corn
stood
yellow
in
all
the
land
and
the
ripe
apples
dropped
to
the
lo
the
round
sun
the
western
seen
as
along
an
unglazed
lingers
and
lolls
loth
to
be
done
with
day
gifting
the
long
lean
lanky
street
and
its
abounding
confluences
of
being
with
aspects
generous
and
bland
making
a
thousand
harnesses
to
shine
as
with
new
ore
from
some
enchanted
mine
and
every
horse
s
coat
so
full
of
sheen
he
looks
and
every
bus
feels
clean
and
never
a
hansom
but
is
worth
the
feeing
and
every
jeweller
within
the
pale
offers
a
real
arabian
night
for
sale
and
even
the
roar
of
the
strong
streams
of
toil
that
pause
and
pour
eastward
and
westward
sounds
seems
as
it
were
bemused
and
blurred
and
like
the
speech
of
lazy
seas
on
a
with
this
enchanted
lustrousness
this
mellow
magic
that
as
a
man
s
caress
brings
back
to
some
faded
face
beloved
before
a
heavenly
shadow
of
the
grace
it
wore
ere
the
poor
eyes
were
minded
to
beseech
old

you
hail

a
call
of

floated
from

ear

all
golden
in

down
a
golden
coasted
sky
the

not

but
seems
dispersed
in
wafts
and
drifts
of
gold
and
shed
upon
a
past
of
golden
song
and
story
and
memories
of
gold
and

iv

poisonous

over
a
continent
of
blight
like
a
maleficent
influence
released
from
the
most
squalid
cellarage
of
hell
the
the
the
hangman
wind
that
tortures
temper
and
comes
slouching
sullen
and
obscene
hard
on
the
skirts
of
the
embittered
night
and
in
a
cloud
unclean
of
excremental
humours
roused
to
strife
by
the
operation
of
some
ruinous
change
wherever
his
evil
mandate
run
and
range
into
a
dire
intensity
of
life
a
craftsman
at
his
bench
he
settles
down
to
the
grim
job
of
throttling
london
town
so
by
a
jealous
lightlessness
beset
that
might
have
oppressed
the
dragons
of
old
time
crunching
and
groping
in
the
abysmal
slime
a
cave
of
thoughts
and
villainous
dreams
and
crying
with
cold
and
dirt
and
wet
the
afflicted
city
prone
from
mark
to
mark
in
shameful
occultation
seems
a
nightmare
labyrinthine
dim
and
drifting
with
wavering
gulfs
and
antic
heights
and
shifting
rent
in
the
stuff
of
a
material
dark
wherein
the
lamplight
scattered
and
sick
and
pale
shows
like
the
leper
s
living
blotch
of
bale
uncoiling
monstrous
into
street
on
street
paven
with
perils
teeming
with
mischance
where
man
and
beast
go
blindfold
and
in
dread
working
with
oaths
and
threats
and
faltering
feet
somewhither
in
the
hideousness
ahead
working
through
wicked
airs
and
deadly
dews
that
make
the
laden
robber
grin
askance
at
the
good
places
in
his
black
romance
and
the
poor
loitering
harlot
rather
choose
go
pinched
and
pined
to
bed
than
lurk
and
shiver
and
curse
her
wretched
way
from
arch
to
arch
scouting
some
threepenny
prey
forgot
his
dawns
and
afterglows
his
green
garlands
and
windy
eyots
forgot
the
old
flows
his
watchfires
cores
of
menace
in
the
gloom
as
he
came
oozing
from
the
pit
and
bore
sunk
in
his
filthily
transfigured
sides
shoals
of
dishonoured
dead
to
tumble
and
rot
in
the
squalor
of
the
universal
shore
his
voices
sounding
through
the
gruesome
air
as
from
the
ferry
where
the
boat
of
doom
with
her
blaspheming
cargo
reels
and
rides
the
while
his
children
the
brave
ships
no
more
adventurous
and
fair
nor
tripping
it
light
of
heel
as
brides

infamously
enchanted
huddle
together
in
the
foul
eclipse
or
feel
their
course
by
inches
desperately
as
through
a
tangle
of
alleys
from
sinister
reach
to
reach
sea
and
death
the
death
with
his
lean
professional
smile
death
in
his
threadbare
working
comes
to
your
bedside
unannounced
and
bland
and
with
expert
inevitable
hand

at

in

of

insufferable

patient
sits
him
down
to
the
black
job
of
burking
london

that
blow
as
over

trooping

unparalleled
splash
and
churn
the
wealth
of
her
enchanted
urn
till
all
between
her
cheerful
margents
grey
and
living
green
it
floats
and
wanders
glittering
and
fleeing
an
estuary
of
the
joy
of
being
why
should
the
lovely
leafage
of
the
park
touch
to
an
ecstasy
the
act
of
seeing
sure
my
paramour
my
bride
of
brides
lingering
and
flushed
mysteriously
abides
in
some
dim
angle
of
odorous
dark
some
smiling
nook
of
shade

divine
conviction

and
crowned

his
immemorial
round

as
the
of
all
things
made
there
is
no
man
this
deifying
day
but
feels
the
primal
blessing
in
his
blood
there
is
no
woman
but
the
sacred
impulse
of
the
may
brightening
like
sex
made
sunshine
through
her
to
vail
the
ensigns
of
her
womanhood
none

rejoicing
flaunts
them

goes
bounteous
in

you
an

vaulted
about
with
the
wonder

striving
to
reach
from
your

something
you
feel

takes

lovingly
woos
you

soothes
you
back
as
you
cling
to
it
back
to
some
comforting
corner
of
sleep
so
you
wake
in
your
bed
having
lived
having
loved
but
the
shadows
are
there
and
the
world
and
its
kingdoms
incredibly
faded
and
you
group
through
the
terror
above
you
and
under
for
the
light
for
the
warmth
the
assurance

the
blasts
are

the

burns
