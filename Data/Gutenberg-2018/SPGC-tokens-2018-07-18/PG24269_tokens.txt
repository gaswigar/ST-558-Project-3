before

ere

telemachus
himself
mark
her
for
sad
amid

all
he
sat
pourtraying
in
deep
thought
contemplative
his
noble
sire
and
questioning
if
yet
perchance
the
hero
might
return
to
chase
from
all
his
palace
that
imperious
herd
to
his
own
honour
lord
of
his

amid

musing
thus
sudden
he
saw
the
goddess
and
sprang
forth
for
he
to
see
a
guest
admittance
long
delay
approaching
eager
her
right
hand
he
seized
the
brazen
spear
took
from

and
in
words
with
welcome
wing
minerva
thus
address
stranger

hail
to

our
cordial
love

inform
me
wherefore
thou
hast
here
arrived
so
saying
toward
the
spacious
hall
he
moved
follow
by
pallas
and
arriving
soon
beneath
the
lofty
roof
placed
her
bright
spear
within
a
pillar
cavity
long
time
the
armoury
where
many
a
spear
had
stood
bright
weapons
of
his
own
illustrious
sire
then
leading
her
toward
a
footstool
throne
magnificent
which
first
he
overspread
with
linen
there
he
seated
her
apart
from
that
rude
throng
and
for
himself
disposed
a
throne
of
various
colours
at
her
side
lest
stunn
with
clamour
of
the
lawless
band
the
should
loth
perchance
to
eat
and
that
more
free
he
might
the
stranger
ear
with
questions
of
his
absent
sire
address
and
now
a
maiden
charg
with
golden
and
with
an
argent
laver
pouring
first
pure
water
on
their
hands
supplied
them
next
with
a
resplendent
table

the
chaste
directress
of

furnish
with
bread

dainties
remnants
of
the
last
regale
then
in
his
turn
the
sewer
with
meats
dish
after
dish
served
them
of
various
kinds
and
golden
cups
beside
the
chargers
placed
which
the
attendant

fill
with

long
in
rush
the
suitors
and
the
thrones
and
couches
occupied
on
all
whose
hands
the
heralds
pour
pure
water
then
the
maids
attended
them
with
bread
in
baskets
heap
and
eager
they
assail
the
ready
feast
at
length
when
neither
thirst
nor
hunger
more
they
felt
unsatisfied
to
new
delights
their
thoughts
they
turn
to
song
and
sprightly
dance
enlivening
sequel
of
the
banquet
joys
an
herald
then
to
phemius
hand
his
beauteous
lyre
he
through
constraint
regaled
the

with
his
song

while
the
chords
he
struck
in
prelude
to
his
pleasant
strains
telemachus
his
head
inclining
nigh
to

wantons
who
the
bread
unpurchased
eat
of
one
whose
bones
on
yonder
continent
lie
drench
by
all
the
of

ah

to
his

restored
both
gold
and

would
wish

thy
questions
satisfy

with

i
now
arrive
seeking
a
people
of
another

athwart
the
gloomy

in

of
brass
for
which
i
barter

ploughing
the

beneath
the
woods
of

at
yonder
field
that
skirts
your
city
in
the

rhethrus
rides
we
are
hereditary
guests
our
sires
were
friends
long
since
as
when
thou
seest
him
next
the
hero
old
laertes
will
avouch
of
whom
i
learn
that
he
frequents
no
more
the
city
now
but
in
sequester
scenes
dwells
sorrowful
and
by
an
antient
dame
with
food
and
drink
supplied
oft
as
he
feels
refreshment
needful
to
him
while
he
creeps
between
the
rows
of
his
luxuriant
vines
but
i
have
come
drawn
hither
by
report
which
spake
thy
sire
arrived
though
still
it
seems
the
adverse
gods
his
homeward
course
retard
for
not
yet
breathless
lies
the
noble
chief
but
in
some
island
of
the
boundless
flood
resides
a
prisoner
by
barbarous
force
of
some
rude
race
detained
reluctant
there
and
i
will
now
foreshow
thee
what
the
gods
teach
me
and
what
though
neither
augur
nor
prophet
i
yet
trust
shall
come
to
pass
he
shall
not
henceforth
live
an
exile
long
from
his
own
shores
no
not
although
in
bands
of
iron
held
but
will
ere
long
contrive
his
own
return
for
in
expedients
framed
with
ingenuity
he
abounds
but
tell
me
true
art
thou
in
stature
such
son
of
himself
ulysses
for
thy
face
and
eyes
strongly
indicate
ulysses
in
thee
frequent
have
we
both
conversed
together
thus
thy
sire
and
i
ere
yet
he
went
to
troy
the
mark
to
which
so
many
princes
of
achaia
steer
him
since
i
saw
not
nor
ulysses
me
to
whom
telemachus
discrete
replied
stranger
i
tell
thee
true
my
mother
voice
affirms
me
his
but
since
no
mortal
knows
his
derivation
i
affirm
it
not
would
i
had
been
son
of
some
happier
sire
ordain
in
calm
possession
of
his
own
to
reach
the
verge
of
life
but
now
report
proclaims
me
his
whom
i
of
all
mankind
unhappiest
thy
question
is
resolved
then
answer
thus
pallas
return
from
no
ignoble
race
in
future
days
the
gods
shall
prove
thee
sprung
whom
so
with
grace
penelope
hath
borne
but
tell
me
true
what
festival
is
this
this
throng
whence
are
they
wherefore
hast
thou
need
of
such
a
multitude
behold
i
here
a
banquet
or
a
nuptial
for
these
meet
not
by
contribution
to
regale
with
such
brutality
and
din
they
hold
their
riotous
banquet
a
wise
man
and
good
arriving
now
among
them
at
the
sight
of
such
enormities
would
much
be
wroth
to
whom
replied
telemachus
discrete
since
stranger
thou
hast
ask
learn
also
this
while
yet
ulysses
with
his
people
dwelt
his
presence
warranted
the
hope
that
here
virtue
should
dwell
and
opulence
but
hath
cast
for
us
at
length
a
lot
and
he
is
lost
as
never
man
before
for
i
should
less
lament
even
his
death
had
he
among
his
friends
at
ilium
or
in
the
arms
of
his
companions
died
troy
siege
accomplish
then
his
tomb
the
greeks
of
tribe
had
built
and
for
his
son
he
had
immortal
glory
atchieved
but
now
by
harpies
torn
inglorious
beyond
reach
of
eye
or
ear
he
lies
and
hath
to
me
grief
only
and
unceasing
sighs
bequeath
nor
mourn
i
for
his
sake
alone
the
gods
have
plann
for
me
still
many
a
woe
beside
for
all
the
rulers
of
the
neighbour
isles
samos
dulichium
and
the
zacynthus
others
also
rulers
here
in
craggy
ithaca
my
mother
seek
in
marriage
and
my
household
stores
consume
but
neither
she
those
nuptial
rites
abhorr
refuses
absolute
nor
yet
consents
to
end
them
they
my
patrimony
waste
meantime
and
will
not
long
spare
even
me
to
whom
with
deep
commiseration
pang
pallas
replied
alas
great
need
hast
thou
of
thy
long
absent
father
to
avenge
these
wrongs
for
could
he
now
appear
there
at
yon
portal
arm
with
helmet
shield
and
grasping
his
two
spears
such
as
when
first
i
saw
him
drinking
joyous
at
our
board
from
ilus
son
of
mermeris
who
dwelt
in
distant
ephyre
just
then
return
for
thither
also
had
ulysses
gone
in
his
swift
bark
seeking
some
drug
wherewith
to
taint
his
brazen
arrows
keen
which
drug
through
fear
of
the
eternal
gods
ilus
refused
him
and
my
father
free
gave
to
him
for
he
loved
him
past
belief
could
now
ulysses
clad
in
arms
as
then
mix
with
these
suitors
short
his
date
of
life
to
each
and
bitter
should
his
nuptials
prove
but
these
events
whether
he
shall
return
to
take
just
vengeance
under
his
own
roof
or
whether
not
lie
all
in
the
gods
lap
meantime
i
counsel
thee
thyself
to
think
by
what
means
likeliest
thou
shalt
expel
these
from
thy
doors
now
mark
me
close
attend
summoning
the
grecian
chiefs
to
council
speak
to
them
and
call
the
gods
to
witness
that
solemnity
bid
go
the
suitors
hence
each
to
his
own
abode
thy
mother
if
her
purpose
be
resolved
on
marriage
let
her
to
the
house
return
of
her
own
potent
father
who
himself
shall
furnish
forth
her
matrimonial
rites
and
ample
such
as
it
well
becomes
a
darling
daughter

for

a
strain
thou
beside
such
as

the

of

it

the

reposing

deep
in

again
with

sought
her
upper

she

till
minerva
bathed
her

then
echoed
through

all

though
addict
to
contumacious
wrangling
fierce
suspend
your
clamour
for

to
me
it
seems
more
decent
far
when
such
a
bard
as
this
godlike
for
sweetness
sings
to
hear
his
song
meet
we
in
full
council
all
that
i
may
plainly
warn
you
to

from

ye
where
ye
may
your

consume
your

at

if
it

to
eat
voracious
thus
the
patrimonial
goods
of
one
man
no
account
of

know
that
i
will
cry
ceaseless
to
the
eternal
gods
in
hope
that
jove
for
retribution
of
the
wrong
shall
doom
you
where
ye
have

of
your

he
ended
and
each
gnaw
his
lip
aghast
at
his
undaunted
hardiness
of
speech
then
thus
antinoüs
spake
eupithes
son
telemachus
the
gods
methinks
themselves
teach
thee
sublimity
and
to
pronounce
thy
matter
fearless
ah
forbid
it
jove
that
one
so
eloquent
should
with
the
weight
of
kingly
cares
in

be
charged
a
realm
by
claim
hereditary
thine
then
prudent
thus
telemachus
replied
although
my

antinoüs
may
perchance
provoke
thee
know
that
i
am
not
averse
from
kingly
cares
if
jove
appoint
me
such
seems
it
to
thee
a
burthen
to
be
by
men
above
all
others
trust
me
no
there
is
no
ill
in
royalty
the
man
so

waits
not

he
obtain

i

that

may
no

be

eurymachus
replied
the

what
grecian
chief

reign
in

telemachus
meantime
thou
hast
unquestionable
right
to
keep
thy

in
thy

may
never

on

arrive
while
an

shall
yet
be
left

who
shall
by
violence
wrest
thine
from

permit
me

to
ask
thee
of
thy

whence
came
the
man
what
country
claims
him
where
are
to
be
found
his
kindred
and
his

brings
he
glad

of

he
to

a

due
to
himself
how
swift
he

him
gave
to
those
who

answered
thus
telemachus

eurymachus
my

no

can
no

believe
if
such
arrive
nor
he
i
more
the

my

this
my

hath
known
in

my

he
came
from

son
of
brave
anchialus
mentes
by

and
chief
of
the
taphian
race
so
spake
telemachus

in

telemachus
to
his

built
in

retired

with
a

in

musings
occupied

call
her
to

she
bore
the

with

loved

him
in

open
his

and
sat
on

then
putting
off
his
vest

placed
it
in

first
folding
it
with

suspended
it

going
forth
drew
by
its
silver
ring
the

close
and
fasten
it
with

at

calls
on

my

is
that
i
have
lost
a

father
who
as

rule
benign
their

govern
once

the
more
alarming
ill
with

threatens
my

with

who
in

to

who
might

approves

to

me

as
ye
shall
sure
incur
from
all
our

fear
beside
the

lest
they

yourselves
one

practising
on
their
minds
she
hath
deceived
the
greecians
message
after
message
sent
brings
hope
to
each
by
turns
and
promise
fair
but
she
meantime
far
otherwise
intends
her
other
arts
exhausted
all
she
framed
this
stratagem
a
web
of
amplest
size
and
subtlest
woof
beginning
thus
she
spake
princes
my
suitors
since
the
noble
chief
ulysses
is
no
more
press
not
as
yet
my
nuptials
wait
till
i
shall
finish
first
a
robe
lest
all
my
threads
decay
which
for
the
antient
hero
i
prepare
laertes
looking
for
the
mournful
hour
when
fate
shall
snatch
him
to
eternal
rest
else
i
the
censure
dread
of
all
my
sex
should
he
so
wealthy
want
at
last
a
shroud
so
spake
the
queen
and
unsuspicious
we
with
her
request
complied
thenceforth
all
day
she
wove
the
ample
web
and
by
the
aid
of
torches
ravell
it
again
at
night
three
years
by
such
contrivance
she
deceived
the
greecians
but
when
three
whole
years
elaps
the
fourth
arriv
then
conscious
of
the
fraud
a
damsel
of
her
train
told
all
the
truth
and
her
we
found
the
beauteous
work
thus
through
necessity
she
hath
at
length
perform
the
task
and
in
her
own
despight
now
therefore
for
the
information
clear
of
thee
thyself
and
of
the
other
greeks
we
answer
send
thy
mother
hence
with
charge
that
him
she
wed
on
whom
her
father
choice
shall
fall
and
whom
she
shall
herself
approve
but
if
by
long
procrastination
still
she
persevere
wearing
our
patience
out
attentive
only
to
display
the
gifts
by
pallas
so
profusely
dealt
to
her
works
of
surpassing
skill
ingenious
thought
and
subtle
shifts
such
as
no
beauteous
greek
for
aught
that
we
have
heard
in
antient
times
practised
tyro
or
alcemena
fair
or
fair
mycene
of
whom
none
in
art
match
penelope
although
we
yield
to
this
her
last
invention
little
praise
then
know
that
these
her
suitors
will
consume
so
long
thy
patrimony
and
thy
goods
as
she
her
present
purpose
shall
indulge
with
which
the
gods
inspire
her
great
renown
she
to
herself
insures
but
equal
woe
and
devastation
of
thy
wealth
to
thee
for
neither
to
our
proper
works
at
home
go
we
of
that
be
sure
nor
yet
elsewhere
till
him
she
wed
to
whom
she
most
inclines
him
prudent
then
answer
telemachus
antinoüs
it
is
not
possible
that
i
should
thrust
her
forth
against
her
will
who
both
produced
and
reared
me
be
he
dead
or
still
alive
my
sire
is
far
remote
and
should
i
voluntary
hence
dismiss
my
mother
to
icarius
i
must
much
refund
which
hardship
were
and
loss
to
me
so
doing
i
should
also
wrath
incur
from
my
offended
sire
and
from
the
gods
still
more
for
she
departing
would
invoke
erynnis
to
avenge
her
and
reproach
beside
would
follow
me
from
all
mankind
that
word
i
therefore
never
will
pronounce
no
if
ye
judge
your
treatment
at
her
hands
injurious
to
you
go
ye
forth
yourselves
forsake
my
mansion
seek
where
else
ye
may
your
feasts
consume
your
own
alternate
feed
each
at
the
other
cost
but
if
it
seem
wisest
in
your
account
and
best
to
eat
voracious
thus
the
patrimonial
goods
of
one
man
no
account
of
all
bite
to
the
roots
but
know
that
i
will
cry
ceaseless
to
the
eternal
gods
in
hope
that
jove
in
retribution
of
the
wrong
shall
doom
you
where
ye
have
intruded
there
to
bleed
and
of
your
blood
ask
no
account
so
spake
telemachus
and
while
he
spake
the
from
a
lofty
turn
off
two
eagles
on
the
winds
awhile
with
outspread
pinions
ample
side

floated
but
ere
long
aloft
right
the
midst
of
the
assembled
chiefs
they
wheel
around
clang
all
their
plumes
and
with
a
downward
look
eyeing
the
throng
death
boded
ominous
then
rending
each
the
other
face
and
neck
they
sprang
at
once
toward
the
right
and
darted
through
the
town
amazement
universal
at
that
sight
seized
the
assembly
and
with
anxious
thought
each
scann
the
future
amidst
whom
arose
the
hero
halitherses
antient

offspring
of
mastor
for
in
judgment
he
of
portents
augural
and
in
forecast
unerring
his
coevals
all
excell
and
prudent
thus
the
multitude
bespake
ye
men
of
ithaca
give
ear
hear
all
though
chief
my
speech
shall
to
the
suitors
look
for
on
their
heads
devolved
comes
down
the
woe
ulysses
shall
not
from
his
friends
henceforth
live
absent
long
but
hasting
to
his
home
comes
even
now
and
as
he
comes
designs
a
bloody
death
for
these
whose
bitter
woes
no
few
shall
share
inhabitants
with
us
of
pleasant
ithaca
but
let
us
frame
effectual
means
maturely
to
suppress
their
violent
deeds
or
rather
let
themselves
repentant
cease
and
soonest
shall
be
best
not
inexpert
but
i
speak
the
future
and
the
accomplishment
announce
of
all
which
when
ulysses
with
the
greeks
embark
for
troy
i
to
himself
foretold
i
said
that
after
many
woes
and
loss
of
all
his
people
in
the
twentieth
year
unknown
to
all
he
should
regain
his
home
and
my
prediction
shall
be
now
fulfill
him
then
eurymachus
thus
answer
rough
the
son
of
polybus
hence
to
thy
house
thou
hoary
dotard
there
prophetic
teach
thy
children
to
escape
woes
else
to
come
birds
flutter
in
the
beams
of
day
not
all
predictive
death
far
hence
remote
hath
found
ulysses
and
i
would
to
that
where
he
died
thyself
had
perish
too
thou
hadst
not
then
run
with
prophecy
as
now
nor
provocation
to
the
wrath
of
telemachus
in
hope
to
win
perchance
for
thine
some
favour
at
his
hands
but
i
to
foretell
skilled
as
thou
art
in
legends
old
nor
shall
my
threat
be
vain
that
if
by
artifice
thou
move
to
wrath
a
younger
than
thyself
no
matter
whom
woe
first
the
heavier
on
himself
shall
fall
nor
shalt
thou
profit
him
by
thy
attempt
and
we
will
charge
thee
also
with
a
mulct
which
thou
shalt
pay
with
difficulty
and
bear
the
burthen
of
it
with
an
aching
heart
as
for
telemachus
i
him
advise
myself
and
press
the
measure
on
his
choice
earnestly
that
he
send
his
mother
hence
to
her
own
father
house
who
shall
himself
set
forth
her
nuptial
rites
and
shall
endow
his
daughter
sumptuously
and
as
he
ought
for
this
expensive
wooing
as
i
judge
till
then
shall
never
cease
since
we
regard
no
man
no
not
telemachus
although
in
words
neither
fear
we
aught
thy
vain
prognostics
venerable
sir
but
only
hate
thee
for
their
sake
the
more
waste
will
continue
and
disorder
foul
unremedied
so
long
as
she
shall
hold
the
suitors
in
suspense
for
day
by
day
our
emulation
goads
us
to
the
strife
nor
shall
we
going
hence
seek
to
espouse
each
his
own
comfort
suitable
elsewhere
to
whom
discrete
telemachus
replied
eurymachus
and
ye
the
suitor
train
illustrious
i
have
spoken
ye
shall
hear
no
more
this
supplication
urged
by
me
the
gods
and
all
the
greeks
now
know
the
truth
but
give
me
instantly
a
gallant
bark
with
twenty
rowers
skill
their
course
to
win
to
whatsoever
haven
for
i
go
to
sandy
pylus
and
shall
hasten
thence
to
lacedemon
tidings
to
obtain
of
my
sire
or
from
the
lips
of
man
or
by
a
word
from
jove
vouchsafed
himself
best
source
of
notice
to
mankind
if
there
inform
that
still
my
father
lives
i
hope
conceive
of
his
return
although
distress
i
shall
be
patient
yet
a
year
but
should
i
learn
haply
that
he
survives
no
longer
then
returning
i
will
raise
at
home
his
tomb
will
with
such
pomp
perform
his
rites
as
his
great
name
demands
and
give
my
mother
hand
to
whom
i
may
this
said
he
sat
and
after
him
arose
mentor
illustrious
ulysses
friend
to
whom
embarking
thence
he
had
consign
all
his
concerns
that
the
old
chief
might
rule
his
family
and
keep
the
whole
secure
arising
thus
the
senior
sage
began
hear
me
ye
ithacans
be
never
king
henceforth
benevolent
gracious
humane
or
righteous
but
let
every
sceptred
hand
rule
merciless
and
deal
in
wrong
alone
since
none
of
all
his
people
whom
he
with
such
paternal
gentleness
and
love
remembers
the
divine
ulysses
more
that
the
imperious
suitors
thus
should
weave
the
web
of
mischief
and
atrocious
wrong
i
grudge
not
since
at
hazard
of
their
heads
they
make
ulysses
property
a
prey
persuaded
that
the
hero
comes
no
more
but
much
the
people
move
me
how
ye
sit
all
mute
and
though
a
multitude
yourselves
opposed
to
few
risque
not
a
single
word
to
check
the
license
of
these
bold
intruders
then
thus
liocritus
evenor
son
injurious
mentor
headlong
orator
how
thou
move
the
populace
against
the
suitors
trust
me
they
should
find
it
hard
numerous
as
they
are
to
cope
with
us
a
feast
the
prize
or
should
the
king
himself
of
ithaca
returning
undertake
t
expell
the
jovial
suitors
from
his
house
much
as
penelope
his
absence
mourns
his
presence
should
afford
her
little
joy
for
fighting
sole
with
many
he
should
meet
a
dreadful
death
thou
therefore
amiss
as
for
telemachus
let
mentor
him
and
halytherses
furnish
forth
the
friends
long
valued
of
his
sire
with
all
dispatch
though
him
i
judge
far
likelier
to
remain
contented
an
enquirer
here
than
to
perform
the
voyage
now
proposed
thus
saying
liocritus
dissolved
in
haste
the
council
and
the
scattered
concourse
sought
their
homes
while
all
the
suitors
flock
thence
to
the
palace
of
their
absent
king
meantime
telemachus
from
all
resort
retiring
in
the
surf
of
the
gray
deep
first
laved
his
hands
then
thus
to
pallas
pray
o
goddess
who
wast
yesterday
a
guest
beneath
my
roof
and
didst
enjoin
me
then
a
voyage
the
sable
deep
in
quest
of
tidings
of
my
long
regretted
sire
which
voyage
all
in
ithaca
but
most
the
haughty
suitors
obstinate
impede
now
hear
my
suit
and
gracious
interpose
such
he
made
then
pallas
in
the
form
and
with
the
voice
of
mentor
drawing
nigh
in
accents
wing
him
kindly
thus
bespake
telemachus
thou
shalt
hereafter
prove
nor
base
nor
poor
in
talents
if
in
truth
thou
have
received
from
thy
father
force
instill
into
thee
and
resemblest
him
in
promptness
both
of
action
and
of
speech
thy
voyage
shall
not
useless
be
or
vain
but
if
penelope
produced
thee
not
his
son
i
then
hope
not
for
good
effect
of
this
design
which
ardent
thou
pursuest
few
sons
their
fathers
equal
most
appear
degenerate
but
we
find
though
rare
sometimes
a
son
superior
even
to
his
sire
and
since
thyself
shalt
neither
base
be
found
nor
spiritless
nor
altogether
void
of
talents
such
as
grace
thy
royal
sire
i
therefore
hope
success
of
thy
attempt
heed
not
the
suitors
projects
neither
wise
are
they
nor
just
nor
aught
suspect
the
doom
which
now
approaches
them
and
in
one
day
shall
overwhelm
them
all
no
long
suspense
shall
hold
thy
purposed
enterprise
in
doubt
such
help
from
me
of
old
thy
father
friend
thou
shalt
receive
who
with
a
bark
will
serve
thee
and
myself
attend
thee
forth
but
haste
join
thou
the
suitors
and
provide
in
vessels
stow
all
needful
stores
wine
in
thy
jars
and
flour
the
strength
of
man
in
skins
i
will
meantime
select
such
as
shall
voluntary
share
thy
toils
in
ithaca
new
ships
and
old
abound
and
i
will
chuse
myself
for
thee
the
prime
of
all
which
without
more
delay
we
will
launch
out
into
the
spacious
deep
thus
pallas
spake
daughter
of
jove
nor
long
so
greeted
by
the
voice
divine
telemachus
but
to
his
palace
went
distress
in
heart
he
found
the
suitors
there
goats
slaying
in
the
hall
and
fatted
swine
roasting
when
with
a
laugh
antinoüs
flew
to
meet
him
fasten
on
his
hand
and
said
telemachus
in
eloquence
sublime
and
of
a
spirit
not
to
be
controul
give
harbour
in
thy
breast
on
no
account
to
or
enmity
but
eat
far
rather
cheerfully
as
heretofore
and
freely
drink
committing
all
thy
cares
to
the
achaians
who
shall
furnish
forth
a
gallant
ship
and
chosen
crew
for
thee
that
thou
hence
to
pylus
with
all
speed
tidings
to
learn
of
thy
illustrious
sire
to
whom
telemachus
discrete
replied
antinoüs
i
have
no
heart
to
feast
with
guests
so
insolent
nor
can
indulge
the
pleasures
of
a
mind
at
ease
with
you
not
enough
suitors
that
ye
have
used
my
noble
patrimony
as
your
own
while
i
was
yet
a
child
now
grown
mature
and
competent
to
understand
the
speech
of
my
instructors
feeling
too
a
mind
within
me
conscious
of
augmented
i
will
attempt
your
ruin
be
assured
whether
at
pylus
or
continuing
here
i
go
indeed
nor
shall
my
voyage
prove
of
which
i
speak
bootless
or
vain
i
go
an
humble
passenger
who
neither
bark
nor
rowers
have
to
boast
my
own
denied
that
honour
so
ye
judg
it
best
by
you
he
said
and
from
antinoüs
hand
his
own
drew
sudden
then
their
delicate
repast
the
busy
suitors
on
all
sides
prepar
still
taunting
as
they
toil
and
with
sharp
speech
sarcastic
wantoning
of
whom
a
youth
arrogant
as
his
fellows
thus
began
i
see
it
plain
telemachus
intends
our
slaughter
either
he
will
aids
procure
from
sandy
pylus
or
will
bring
them
arm
from
sparta
such
is
his
tremendous
drift
even
to
fruitful
ephyre
perchance
he
will
proceed
seeking
some
baneful
herb
which
cast
into
our
cup
shall
drug
us
all
to
whom
some
haughty
suitor
thus
replied
who
knows
but
that
himself
the
sea
from
all
his
friends
and
kindred
far
remote
may
perish
like
ulysses
whence
to
us
should
double
toil
ensue
on
whom
the
charge
to
parcel
out
his
wealth
would
then
devolve
and
to
endow
his
mother
with
the
house
for
his
abode
whom
she
should
chance
to
wed
so
sported
they
but
he
ascending
sought
his
father
lofty
chamber
where
his
heaps
he
kept

with

they
seeing

arrived
together
all
advanced
and
grasping
courteously

invited

to

first

of

young
pisistratus
approach
who
on
the
hands
of
both
beside
the

placed
them
where

bespake
oh

the

now
adore
for
ye
have
chanced
on

festival
and
when
thou
hast
thyself
libation
made
duly
and
deliver
to
thy

the
juice
that
he
may
also
make
libation
for
he
doubtless
seeks
in

the

all

since

is

with

coeval
first
i
give

to

consign
the

pallas
gladly
from

received

thy

the

first
bestow

requite
their

to

hither
in

and
her
own

accomplish

gave

in

like

also
preferr

now
the

from
the

withdrawn
they
next
distributed
sufficient
share
to
each
and
all
were
sumptuously
regaled
at
length
both
hunger
satisfied
and
thirst
thus
nestor
the
gerenian
chief
began
now
with
more
seemliness
we
may
enquire
after
repast
what
guests
we
have
received
our
guests
who
are
ye
whence
have
ye
the
waves
plough
hither
come
ye
to

or
at

roam
the
deep
like

with
mischief
charged
and
woe
to
foreign
states
oft
hazard

themselves
him
answer
bolder
now
but
still
discrete
telemachus
for
pallas
had
his
heart
with
manly
courage
arm
that
he
might
ask
from
nestor
tidings
of
his
absent
sire
and
win
himself
distinction
and
renown
oh
nestor
neleus
son
glory
of

thou
askest
whence
we

i
tell
thee
whence
from
ithaca
by
the
umbrageous
woods
of
neritus
by
private
need
not
public
urged
we
come
my
errand
is
to
seek
intelligence
of
the
ulysses
of
my
noble
father
for
dauntless
courage
whom
report
proclaims
conqueror
with
thine
aid
of
sacred
troy
we
have
already
learn
where
other
chiefs
who
fought
at
ilium
died
but
jove
conceals
even
the
death
of
my
illustrious
sire
in
dull
obscurity
for
none
hath
heard
or
confident
can
answer
where
he
dy
whether
he
on
the
continent
hath
by
hostile
hands
or
by
the
waves
of
amphitrite
welters
in
the
deep
for
this
cause
at
thy
knees
suppliant
i
beg
that
thou
tell
me
his
end
if
either
thou
that
dread
event
thyself
or
from
some
wanderer
of
the
greeks
hast
heard
it
for
my
father
at
his
birth
was
sure
predestin
to
no
common
woes
neither
through
pity
or
respect
flatter
me
but
explicit
all
relate
which
thou
hast
witness
if
my
noble
sire
gratified
thee
by
performance
just
of
word
or
deed
at
ilium
where
ye
fell
so
slain
in
fight
oh
recollect
now
his
fidelity
and
tell
me
true
then
nestor
thus
gerenian
hero
old
young
friend
since
thou
me
speaking
thus
of
all
the
woes
which
indefatigable
we
sons
of
the
achaians
there
sustain
both
those
which
on
the
deep
we
bore
wherever
by
achilles
led
in
quest
of
booty
and
the
many
woes
beside
which
under
royal
priam
spacious
walls
we
suffer
know
that
there
our
bravest
fell
there
warlike
ajax
lies
there
peleus
son
there
too
patroclus
like
the
gods
themselves
in

and
my
son
beloved
there
brave
virtuous
swift
of
foot
and
bold
in

antilochus
nor
are
these
sorrows
all
what
tongue
of
mortal
man
could
all
relate
thou
abiding
here
five
years
employ
or
six
enquiring
of
the
woes
endured
by
the
achaians
ere
thou
have
the
whole
thou
depart
tir
of
the
tale
for
we
nine
years
stratagems
of
all
kinds
devised
against
them
and
saturnian
jove
scarce
crown
the
difficult
attempt
at
last
there
no
competitor
in
wiles
ulysses
found
so
far
were
all
in
shrewd
invention
by
thy
noble
sire
if
thou
indeed
art
his
as
sure
thou
art
whose
sight
breeds
wonder
in
me
and
thy
speech
his
speech
resembles
more
than
might
be
within
the
scope
of
years
so
green
as
thine
there
never
in
opinion
or
in
voice
illustrious
ulysses
and
myself
divided
were
but
one
in
heart
contrived
as
best
we
might
the
benefit
of
all
but
after
priam
lofty
city
sack
and
the
departure
of
the
greeks
on
board
their
barks
and
when
the
gods
had
scatter
them
then
jove
imagin
for
the
argive
host
a
sorrowful
return
for
neither
just
were
all
nor
prudent
therefore
many
found
a
fate
through
the
vengeful
ire
of
pallas
who
between
the
sons
of
atreus
sharp
contention
interposed
they
both
irregularly
and
against
just
order
summoning
by
night
the
greeks
to
council
of
whom
many
came
with
wine
oppress
promulgated
the
cause
for
which
they
had
convened
the
people
then
it
was
that
menelaus
bade
the
general
host
their
thoughts
bend
homeward
the
sacred
deep
which
agamemnon
in
no
sort
approved
his
counsel
was
to
slay
them
yet
at
troy
that
so
he
might
assuage
the
dreadful
wrath
of
pallas
first
by
sacrifice
and
vain
hope
he
little
thought
how
ill
should
speed
that
fond
attempt
for
once
provok
the
gods
are
not
with
ease
conciliated
again
thus
stood
the
brothers
altercation
hot
maintaining
till
at
length
uprose
the
greeks
with
clamours
and
with
minds
we
slept
the
night
but
teeming
with
disgust
mutual
for
jove
great
woe
prepar
for
all
at
dawn
of
day
we
drew
our
gallies
down
into
the
sea
and
hasty
put
on
board
the
spoils
and
female
captives
half
the
host
with
agamemnon
son
of
atreus
supreme
commander
and
embarking
half
push
forth
swift
course
we
made
for
neptune
the
waves
before
us
of
the
monstrous
deep
at
tenedos
arriv
we
there
sacrifice
to
the
gods
ardent
to
reach
our
native
land
but
unpropitious
jove
not
yet
designing
our
arrival
there
involved
us
in

again
for
all
the

followers
of

thy
noble
sire
to
gratify
our
chief
the
son
of

chose
a
course
and
steer
their
oary
barks
again
to
troy
but
i
assured
that
evil
from
the
gods
impended
all
my
gallant
fleet
fled
thence
in
haste
and
warlike
diomede
exhorting
his
attendants
also
fled
at
length
the
hero

our
fleets
at

there
he
found
us
held
in
deep
deliberation
on
the
length
of

before
us
whether
we
should
steer
above
the
craggy
chios
to
the
isle
psyria
that
island
holding
on
our
left
or
under
chios
by
the
heights
of
mimas
then
we
ask
from
jove
a
sign
and
by
a
sign
vouchsafed
he
bade
us
cut
the
wide
sea
to
eubœa
sheer
athwart
so
soonest
to
escape
the
harm
shrill
sang
the
rising
gale
and
with
swift
prows
cleaving
the
fishy
flood
we
reach
by
night
geræstus
where
arrived
we
burn
the
thighs
of
bulls
to
neptune
who
had
safe
conducted
us
through
all
our
perilous
course
the
fleet
of
diomede
in
safety
on
the
fourth
day
at
argos
but
myself
held
on
my
course
to
pylus
nor
the
wind
one
moment
thwarted
us
or
died
away
when
jove
had
once
commanded
it
to
blow
thus
uninform
i
have
arrived
my
son
nor
of
the
greecians
who
are
saved
have
heard
or
who
have
perish
but
what
news
i
have
obtain
since
my
return
with
truth
i
will
relate
nor
aught
conceal
from
thee
the
myrmidons
as
rumour
speaks
by
neoptolemus
illustrious
son
of
brave
achilles
led
have
safe
arrived
safe
philoctetes
also
son
of
pæas
and
idomeneus
at
crete
hath
landed
all
his
followers
who
survive
the
bloody
war
the
waves
have
swallow
none
ye
have
yourselves
doubtless
although
remote
of
agamemnon
heard
how
he
return
and
how
ægisthus
cruelly
contrived
for
him
a
bloody
welcome
but
himself
hath
with
his
own
life
paid
the
deed
good
is
it
therefore
if
a
son
survive
the
slain
since
agamemnon
son
hath
well
avenged
his
father
death
slaying
himself
ægisthus
foul
assassin
of
his
sire
young
friend
for
pleas
thy
youth
i
view
and
just
proportion
be
thou
also
bold
that
thine
like
his
may
be
a
deathless
name
then
prudent
him
answer
telemachus
oh
nestor
neleus
son
glory
of
greece
and
righteous
was
that
vengeance
renown
achaia
sons
shall
far
and
wide
diffuse
to
future
times
transmitting
it
in
song
ah
would
that
such
ability
the
gods
would
grant
to
me
that
i
as
well
the
deeds
might
punish
of
our
suitors
whose
excess
enormous
and
whose
bitter
taunts
i
feel
continual
object
of
their
subtle
hate
but
not
for
me
such
happiness
the
gods
have
twined
into
my
thread
no
not
for
me
or
for
my
father
patience
is
our
part
to
whom
gerenian
nestor
thus
replied
young
friend
since
thou
me
of
that
theme
fame
here
reports
that
suitors
haunt
thy
palace
for
thy
mother
sake
and
there
much
evil
perpetrate
in
thy
despight
but
say
thou
willing
their
controul
imperious
or
because
the
people
by
some
response
oracular
incline
against
thee
but
who
knows
the
time
may
come
when
to
his
home
restored
either
alone
or
aided
by
the
force
of
all
the
greeks
ulysses
may
avenge
the
wrong
at
least
should
pallas
thee
love
as
erst
at
troy
the
scene
of
our
unnumber
woes
she
lov
ulysses
for
i
have
not
known
the
gods
assisting
so
apparently
a
mortal
man
as
him
minerva
there
should
pallas
view
thee
also
with
like
love
and
kind
solicitude
some
few
of
those
should
dream
perchance
of
wedlock
never
more
then
answer
thus
telemachus
return
that
word
accomplishment
i
can
not
hope
it
promises
too
much
the
thought
alone
me
an
event
so
fortunate
would
unexpected
on
my
part
arrive
although
the
gods
themselves
should
purpose
it
but
pallas
him
answer
telemachus
what
word
was
that
which
the
guard
that
should
have
fenced
it
in
a
god
so
willing
could
with
utmost
ease
save
any
man
remote
myself
i
had
much
rather
many
woes
endured
revisit
home
at
last
happy
and
safe
than
sooner
coming
die
in
my
own
house
as
agamemnon
perish
by
the
arts
of
base
ægisthus
and
the
subtle
queen
yet
not
the
gods
themselves
can
save
from
death
the
man
whom
most
they
love
when
fate
ordains
him
once
to
his
last
sleep
to
whom
telemachus
discrete
replied
it
interest
us
let
us
leave
this
question
mentor
he
i
am
assured
returns
no
more
but
hath
already
found
a
sad
sad
fate
by
the
decree
of
but
i
would
now
interrogate
again
nestor
and
on
a
different
theme
for
him
in
human
rights
i
judge
and
laws
expert
and
in
all
knowledge
beyond
other
men
for
he
hath
govern
as
report
proclaims
three
generations
therefore
in
my
eyes
he
wears
the
awful
impress
of
a
god
oh
nestor
son
of
neleus
tell
me
true
what
was
the
manner
of
atrides
death
agamemnon
tell
me
where
was
menelaus
by
what
means
contrived
ægisthus
to
inflict
the
fatal
blow
slaying
so
much
a
nobler
than
himself
had
not
the
brother
of
the
monarch
achaian
argos
yet
but
still
in
other
climes
his
long
absence
gave
ægisthus
courage
for
that
bloody
deed
whom
answer
the
gerenian
chief
renown
my
son
i
will
inform
thee
true
meantime
thy
own
suspicions
border
on
the
fact
had
menelaus
hero
amber
hair
ægisthus
found
living
at
his
return
from
ilium
never
on
bones
the
greeks
had
heap
a
tomb
but
dogs
and
fowls
had
torn
him
lying
in
the
open
field
far
from
the
town
nor
him
had
woman
wept
of
all
in
greece
for
he
had
foul
transgress
but
we
in
many
an
arduous
task
engaged
lay
before
ilium
he
the
while
secure
within
the
green
retreats
of
argos
found
occasion
apt
by
to
delude
the
spouse
of
agamemnon
she
at
first
the
royal
clytemnestra
firm
refused
the
deed
dishonourable
for
she
bore
a
virtuous
mind
and
at
her
side
a
bard
attended
ever
whom
the
king
to
troy
departing
had
appointed
to
the
charge
but
when
the
gods
had
purposed
to
ensnare
ægisthus
then
dismissing
far
remote
the
bard
into
a
desart
isle
he
there
abandon
him
to
fowls
a
prey
and
to
his
own
home
willing
as
himself
led
clytemnestra

he
on
all
their
hallow
altars
to
the
gods
and
hung
with
images
and
gold
their
shrines
his
great
exploit
past

and

had
sailed
from

together
but
when

a

past

whom
none

therefore
menelaus
was
detained
giving
his
friend
due
burial
and
his
rites
funereal
celebrating
though
in

still
to
proceed
but
when
with

scarce

while

the
friends
of
noble
menelaus
feasting
sat
within
his
spacious
palace
among
whom
a
sacred
bard
sang
sweetly
to
his
harp
while
in
the
midst
two
dancers
smote
the
ground
with
measur
steps
responsive
to
his
song
and
now
the
heroes
nestor
noble
son
and
young
telemachus
arrived
within
the
vestibule
whom
issuing
from
the
hall
the
noble
eteoneus
of
the
train
of
menelaus
saw
at
once
he
ran
across
the
palace
to
report
the
news
to
his
lord
ear
and
standing
at
his
side
in
accents
wing
with
haste
thus
greeted
him
oh
menelaus
descended
chief
two
guests
arrive
both
strangers
but
the
race
of
jove
supreme
resembling
each
in
form
say
shall
we
loose
ourselves
their
rapid
steeds
or
hence
dismiss
them
to
some
other
host
but
menelaus
hero
indignant
answer
him
boethe
son
thou
wast
not
eteoneus
heretofore
a
babbler
who
now
pratest
as
a
child
we
have
ourselves
arrived
indebted
much
to
hospitality
of
other
men
if
jove
shall
even
here
some
pause
at
last
of
woe
afford
us
therefore
loose
at
once
their
steeds
and
introduce
them
to
the
feast
he
said
and
issuing
eteoneus
the
brisk
attendants
to
his
aid
with
whom
he
loos
their
foaming
coursers
from
the
yoke
them
first
they
bound
to
mangers
which
with
oats
and
mingled
barley
they
supplied
then
thrust
the
chariot
sidelong
to
the
splendid
wall
themselves
he
next
into
the
royal
house
conducted
who
survey
the
abode
of
the
king
for
on
all
sides
as
with
the
splendour
of
the
sun
or
moon
the
lofty
dome
of
menelaus
blazed
satiate
at
length
with
wonder
at
that
sight
they
enter
each
a
bath
and
by
the
hands
of
maidens
laved
and
oil
and
cloath
again
with
shaggy
mantles
and
resplendent
vests
sat
both
enthroned
at
menelaus
side
and
now
a
maiden
charged
with
golden
and
with
an
argent
laver
pouring
first
pure
water
on
their
hands
supplied
them
next
with
a
bright
table
which
the
maiden
chief
in
office
furnish
plenteously
with
bread
and
dainties
remnants
of
the
last
regale
then
came
the
who
with
delicious
meats
dish
after
dish
served
them
and
placed
beside
the
chargers
cups
magnificent
of
gold
when
menelaus
grasp
their
hands
and
said
eat
and
rejoice
and
when
ye
shall
have
shared
our
nuptial
banquet
we
will
then
inquire
who
are
ye
both
for
certain
not
from
those
whose
generation
perishes
are
ye
but
rather
of
some
race
of
sceptred
chiefs
the
base
have
never
sons
like
you
so
saying
he
from
the
board
lifted
his
own
distinguish
portion
and
the
fatted
chine
gave
to
his
guests
the
viands
they
with
outstretch
hands
assail
and
when
the
force
no
longer
now
of
appetite
they
felt
telemachus
inclining
close
his
head
to
nestor
son
lest
others
should
his
speech
witness
in
whisper
words
him
thus
address
dearest
pisistratus
observe
my
friend
how
all
the
echoing
palace
with
the
light
of
beaming
brass
of
gold
and
amber
shines
silver
and
ivory
for
radiance
such
th
interior
mansion
of
olympian
jove
i
deem
what
wealth
how
various
how
immense
is
here
astonish
i
survey
the
sight
but
menelaus
his
speech
thus
in
accents
wing
replied
my
children
let
no
mortal
man
pretend
comparison
with
jove
for
jove
abode
and
all
his
stores
are
incorruptible
but
whether
mortal
man
with
me
may
vie
in
the
display
of
wealth
or
whether
not
this
know
that
after
many
toils
endured
and
perilous
wide
in
the
eighth
year
i
brought
my
treasures
home
remote
i
roved
to
cyprus
to
phœnice
to
the
shores
of
ægypt
æthiopia
land
i
reach
th
erembi
the
sidonians
and
the
coasts
of
lybia
where
the
lambs
their
foreheads
shew
at
once
with
horns
defended
soon
as
yean
there
thrice
within
the
year
the
flocks
produce
nor
master
there
nor
shepherd
ever
feels
a
dearth
of
cheese
of
flesh
or
of
sweet
milk
delicious
drawn
from
udders
never
dry
while
thus
commodities
on
various
coasts
i
roam
another
by
the
arts
of
his
pernicious
spouse
aided
of
life
bereav
my
brother
privily
and
when
least
he
fear
to
lose
it
therefore
little
joy
to
me
results
from
all
that
i
possess
your
fathers
be
those
fathers
who
they
may
these
things
have
doubtless
told
you
for
immense
have
been
my
and
i
have
a
palace
well
inhabited
and
stored
with
precious
furniture
in
kind
such
that
i
would
to
i
own
at
home
though
but
the
third
of
it
and
that
the
greeks
who
perish
then
beneath
the
walls
of
troy
far
from
argos
still
survived
yet
while
sequester
here
i
frequent
mourn
my
slaughter
friends
by
turns
i
sooth
my
soul
with
tears
shed
for
them
and
by
turns
again
i
cease
for
grief
soon
satiates
free
indulged
but
of
them
all
although
i
all
bewail
none
mourn
i
so
as
one
whom
calling
back
to
memory
i
both
sleep
and
food
abhor
for
of
achaia
sons
none
ever
toiled
strenuous
as
ulysses
but
his
lot
was
woe
and
unremitting
sorrow
mine
for
his
long
absence
who
if
still
he
live
we
know
not
aught
or
be
already
dead
him
doubtless
old
laertes
mourns
and
him
discrete
penelope
nor
less
his
son
telemachus
born
newly
when
he
sail
so
saying
he
kindled
in
him
strong
desire
to
mourn
his
father
at
his
father
name
fast
fell
his
tears
to
ground
and
with
both
hands
he
spread
his
purple
cloak
before
his
eyes
which
menelaus
marking
doubtful
sat
if
he
should
leave
him
leisure
for
his
tears
or
question
him
and
tell
him
all
at
large
while
thus
he
doubted
helen
as
it
chanced
leaving
her
fragrant
chamber
came
august
as
dian
goddess
of
the
golden
bow
adrasta
for
her
use
set
forth
a
throne
alcippe
with
soft
arras
cover
it
and
philo
brought
her
silver
basket
gift
of
fair
alcandra
wife
of
polybus
whose
mansion
in
ægyptian
thebes
is
rich
in
untold
treasure
and
who
gave
himself
ten
golden
talents
and
two
silver
baths
to
menelaus
with
two
splendid
tripods
beside
the
noble
gifts
which
at
the
hand
of
his
illustrious
spouse
helen
receiv
a
golden
spindle
and
a
basket
wheel
itself
of
silver
and
its
lip
of
gold
that
basket
philo
her
own
handmaid
placed
at
beauteous
helen
side
charged
to
the
brim
with
slender
threads
on
which
the
spindle
lay
with
wool
of
purple
lustre
wrapp
around
approaching
on
her
throne
she
sat
and
instant
of
her
royal
spouse
enquired
know
we
my
menelaus
dear
to
jove
these
guests
of
ours
and
whence
they
have
arrived
erroneous
i
may
speak
yet
speak
i
must
in
man
or
woman
never
have
i
seen
such
likeness
to
another
i
gaze
as
in
this
stranger
to
the
son
of
brave
ulysses
whom
that
hero
left
at
home
when
shameless
as
i
was
for
my
unworthy
sake
the
greecians
sailed
to
ilium
with
fierce
rage
of
battle
fir
then
menelaus
thus
the
i
also
such
resemblance
find
in
him
as
thou
such
feet
such
hands
the
cast
of
eye
similar
and
the
head
and
flowing
locks
and
even
now
when
i
ulysses
named
and
his
great
sufferings
mention
in
my
cause
the
bitter
tear
dropp
from
his
lids
while
broad
before
his
eyes
his
purple
cloak
he
spread
to
whom
the
son
of
nestor
thus
replied
atrides
menelaus
chief
renown
he
is
in
truth
his
son
as
thou
hast
said
but
he
is
modest
and
would
much
himself
condemn
if
at
his
first
arrival
here
he
should
loquacious
seem
and
bold
to
thee
to
whom
we
listen
captived
by
thy
voice
as
if
some
god
had
spoken
as
for
me
nestor
my
father
the
gerenian
chief
bade
me
conduct
him
hither
for
he
to
see
thee
promising
himself
from
thee
the
benefit
of
some
kind
word
or
deed
for
destitute
of
other
aid
he
much
his
father
tedious
absence
mourns
at
home
so
fares
telemachus
his
father
strays
remote
and
in
his
stead
no
friend
hath
he
who
might
avert
the
mischiefs
that
he
feels
to
whom
the
hero
replied
ye
gods
the
offspring
of
indeed
a
friend
hath
reach
my
house
of
one
who
hath
endured
arduous
conflicts
for
my
sake
and
much
i
purpos
had
olympian
jove
vouchsaf
us
passage
the
deep
to
have
receiv
him
with
such
friendship
here
as
none
beside
in
argos
i
had
then
founded
a
city
for
him
and
had
a
palace
for
himself
i
would
have
brought
the
hero
hither
and
his
son
with
all
his
people
and
with
all
his
wealth
some
town
evacuating
for
his
sake
of
those
ruled
by
myself
and
close
my
own
thus
situate
we
had
often
interchanged
sweet
converse
nor
had
other
cause
at
last
our
friendship
terminated
or
our
joys
than
death
black
cloud
him
or
me
but
such
delights
could
only
envy
move
in
the
gods
who
have
of
all
the
greeks
amerc
only
of
his
wish
return
so
saying
he
kindled
the
desire
to
weep
in
bosom
argive
helen
wept
abundant
jove
own
daughter
wept
as
fast
telemachus
and
menelaus
both
nor
nestor
son
with
tearless
eyes
remain
calling
to
mind
antilochus
by
the
son
illustrious
of
the
bright
aurora
slain
whom
in
accents
wing
he
said
atrides
antient
nestor
when
of
late
conversing
with
him
we
remember
thee
pronounced
thee
wise
beyond
all
now
therefore
let
not
even
my
advice
displease
thee
it
affords
me
no
delight
to
intermingle
tears
with
my
repast
and
soon
aurora
daughter
of
the
dawn
will
tinge
the

not

due
lamentation
of
a
friend
deceased
blameworthy
since
to

is
all
we
can
for

i
also

i

to

the
hero
of
the

nought
which
thou

would
have
disgraced
a
man
of

maturer
far
than
thine
for
wise
thy
father
is
and
such
art
thou
and
easy
is
it
to
discern

of
such

the
sorrow
into
which
we
sudden
fell
shall
pause

now
remember
we
the

pour
water
on
our
hands
for
we
shall
find
telemachus

i
no

at

poured
pure

otherwise
meantime
employ
into
the

a

his

so
medicated

he

however
when

him
openly
in

told
me
the

he
bore
to

oh
what

then
was

but
my

exulted
alter
now
and
wishing
home
for

my
crime
committed
under

i
deplored
what

her

then
the

helen
thou
hast
well
spoken
all
is
true
i
have
the
talents
fathom
and
the
minds
of
heroes
and
have
travell
far
yet
never
saw
i
with
these
eyes
in

such
firmness
as
the
calm
ulysses
own
none
such
as
in
the

horse
he
proved
where
all
our

sat
designing

havoc
for

impell

inclin

to

with
thee
came
godlike
deiphobus
thrice
round
about
the
hollow
ambush
striking
with

by

didst
call

feigning

myself
with

i
with
ardour
burn
either
to
quit
the
horse
so
summon
or
to
answer
from
within
but
all
impatient
as
we
were
ulysses
controul
the
rash
design
so
there
the
sons
of
the
achaians
silent
sat
and
mute
and
of
us
all
anticlus
would
alone
have
answer
but
ulysses
with
both

compressing
close
his

saved
us

conducted
thee
again

preserved
not
neither

scaped
his
cruel
doom
but

dismiss
us
hence
that
on
our

reposed
we
may
enjoy
sleep
needful
now
he

their
ambition
is
to
reach
the
bed
of
a
brave
man
however
base
themselves
but
as
it
chances
when
the
hart
hath
her
fawns
and
sucklings
yet
to
rest
within
some
dreadful
lion
gloomy
den
she
roams
the
hills
and
in
the
grassy
vales
feeds
heedless
till
the
lion
to
his
lair
return
destroys
her
and
her
so
them
thy
sire
shall
terribly
destroy
jove
pallas
and
apollo
oh
that
such
as
erst
in
lesbos
where
he
strove
with
philomelides
and
threw
him
flat
a
sight
at
which
achaia
sons
rejoic
such
now
ulysses
might
assail
them
all
short
life
and
bitter
nuptials
should
be
theirs
but
thy
enquiries
neither
indirect
will
i
evade
nor
give
thee
false
reply
but
all
that
from
the
antient
of
the
deep
i
have
receiv
will
utter
hiding
nought
as
yet
the
gods
on
ægypt
shore
detained
me
wishing
home
angry
at
my
neglect
to
heap
their
altars
with
slain
hecatombs
for
they
exacted
from
us
evermore
strict
of
their
laws
there
is
an
isle
amid
the
billowy
flood
pharos
by
name
in
front
of
ægypt
distant
from
her
shore
far
as
a
vessel
by
a
sprightly
gale
impell
may
push
her
voyage
in
a
day
the
haven
there
is
good
and
many
a
ship
finds
there
from
on
the
coast
there
me
the
gods
kept
twenty
days
no
breeze
propitious
granting
that
might
sweep
the
waves
and
usher
to
her
home
the
flying
bark
and
now
had
our
provision
all
consumed
left
us
exhausted
but
a
certain
nymph
pitying
saved
me
daughter
fair
was
she
of
mighty
proteus
antient
of
the
deep
idothea
named
her
most
my
sorrows
moved
she
found
me
from
my
followers
all
apart
for
they
around
the
isle
with
hooks
the
fishes
snaring
roamed
by
famine
urged
and
standing
at
my
side
me
thus
bespake
stranger
thou
must
be
ideot
born
or
weak
at
least
in
intellect
or
thy
delight
is
in
distress
and
who
to
leave
this
island
and
no
egress
hence
canst
find
although
thy
famish
people
faint
so
spake
the
goddess
and
i
thus
replied
i
tell
thee
whosoever
of
the
divine
thou
art
that
i
am
prison
here
not
willingly
but
must
have
doubtless
against
the
deathless
tenants
of
the
skies
yet
say
for
the
immortals
all
things
know
what
god
detains
me
and
my
course
forbids
hence
to
my
country
the
fishy
deep
so
i
to
whom
the
goddess
stranger
i
will
inform
thee
true
a
seer
oracular
the
antient
of
the
deep
immortal
proteus
the
ægyptian
haunts
these
shores
familiar
with
all
ocean
gulphs
and
neptune
subject
he
is
by
report
my
father
him
if
thou
art
able
once
to
seize
and
bind
he
will
prescribe
the
course
with
all
its
measured
distances
by
which
thou
shalt
regain
secure
thy
native
shores
he
will
moreover
at
thy
suit
declare
thou
favour
of
the
skies
what
good
what
ill
hath
in
thine
house
while
absent
thou
thy
voyage
difficult
and
long
she
spake
and
i
replied
thyself
reveal
by
what
effectual
bands
i
may
secure
the
antient
deity
marine
lest
of
my
approach
he
shun
me
and
escape
hard
task
for
mortal
hands
to
bind
a
god
then
thus
idothea
answer
i
will
inform
thee
true
soon
as
the
sun
hath
climb
the
middle
the
prophet
old
emerging
while
the
breezy
zephyr
blows
and
cover
with
the
scum
of
ocean
seeks
his
spacious
cove
in
which
outstretch
he
lies
the
phocæ
also
rising
from
the
waves
offspring
of
beauteous
halosydna
sleep
around
him
and
the
fishy
scent
exhaling
rank
of
the
unfathom
flood
thither
conducting
thee
at
peep
of
day
i
will
dispose
thee
in
some
safe
recess
but
from
among
thy
followers
thou
shalt
chuse
the
bravest
three
in
all
thy
gallant
fleet
and
now
the
artifices
understand
of
the
old
prophet
of
the
sea
the
sum
of
all
his
phocæ
duly
first
he
will
pass
through
them
and
when
all
by
fives
he
counted
hath
will
in
the
midst
repose
content
as
sleeps
the
shepherd
with
his
flock
when
ye
shall
see
him
stretch
then
call
to
mind
that
moment
all
your
prowess
and
prevent
he
strive
impatient
his
escape
all
changes
trying
he
will
take
the
form
of
reptile
on
the
earth
will
seem
a
river
now
and
now
devouring
fire
but
hold
him
ye
and
grasp
him
still
the
more
and
when
himself
shall
question
you
restored
to
his
own
form
in
which
ye
found
him
first
reposing
then
from
farther
force
abstain
then
hero
loose
the
antient
of
the
deep
and
ask
him
of
the
gods
who
checks
thy
course
hence
to
thy
country
the
fishy
flood
so
saying
she
plunged
into
the
billowy
waste
i
then
in
various
musings
lost
my
ships
along
the
station
sought
again
and
when
i
reach
my
galley
on
the
shore
we
supp
and
sacred
night
falling
from
slept
all
extended
on
the
but
when
aurora
daughter
of
the
dawn
look
rosy
forth
pensive
beside
the
shore
i
walk
of
ocean
frequent
to
the
gods
praying
devout
then
chose
the
fittest
three
for
bold
assault
and
worthiest
of
my
trust
meantime
the
goddess
from
the
bosom
wide
of
ocean
rising
brought
us
thence
four
skins
of
phocæ
and
all
newly
stript
a
snare
contriving
subtle
to
deceive
her
sire
four
cradles
in
the
sand
she
scoop
then
sat
expecting
us
who
in
due
time
approach
she
lodg
us
side
by
side
and
over
each
a
raw
skin
cast
horrible
to
ourselves
proved
that
disguise
whom
the
pernicious
scent
of
the
phocæ
sore
annoy
for
who
would
lay
him
down
at
a
whale
side
but
she
a
potent
remedy
devised
herself
to
save
us
who
the
nostrils
of
each
with
pure
ambrosia
thither
brought
odorous
which
the
fishy
scent
subdued
all
morning
patient
watchers
there
we
lay
and
now
the
phocæ
from
the
deep
emerging
slept
along
the
shore
and
he
at
noon
came
also
and
perceiving
there
his
fatted
monsters
through
the
flock
his
course
took
regular
and
summ
them
with
the
first

number
us
suspicion
none
of
fraud
conceiving
then
couch
also
we
at
once
flew
on
him
and
in
our
arms
constrain
him
fast
nor
the
old
call
not
incontinent
his
shifts
to
mind
first
he
became
a
lion
grim
then
dragon
panther
then
a
savage
boar
a
limpid
stream
and
an
tree
we
persevering
held
him
till
at
length
the
antient
of
the
deep
skill
as
he
is
in
wiles
yet
weary
question
me
and
said
oh
atreus
son
by
what
god
instructed
liest
thou
in
wait
for
me
to
seize
and
hold
me
what
is
thy
desire
so
he
to
whom
thus
answer
i
return
old
seer
thou
why
fraudful
thou
ask
it
is
because
i
have
been
prison
long
within
this
isle
whence
i
have
sought
in
vain
till
my
wonted
courage
fails
yet
say
for
the
immortals
all
things
know
what
god
detains
me
and
my
course
forbids
hence
to
my
country
the
fishy
deep
so
i
when
thus
the
old
one
of
the
waves
but
thy
plain
duty
was
to
have
adored
jove
first
in
sacrifice
and
all
the
gods
that
then
embarking
by
propitious
gales
impell
thou
have
reach
thy
country
soon
for
thou
art
doom
to
behold
again
thy
friends
thy
palace
or
thy
native
shores
till
thou
have
seen
once
more
the
hallow
flood
of
ægypt
and
with
hecatombs
adored
devout
the
deathless
tenants
of
the
skies
then
will
they
speed
thee
whither
thou
he
ended
and
my
heart
broke
at
his
words
which
bade
me
pass
again
the
gloomy
gulph
to
ægypt
tedious
course
and
hard
to
atchieve
yet
though
in
sorrow
whelm
i
thus
replied
old
prophet
i
will
all
thy
will
perform
but
tell
me
and
the
truth
simply
reveal
have
the
achaians
with
their

arrived
all
safe

left
and

saved
him
from

fell
bearing
him
with
it
down
into
the
gulphs
of

where
he
drank
the

and
died
but
thy

in
his

escaped
that
fate
by
juno
saved
yet
when
at

he
should
have

then
by

flew
with

a

far
the

to
the

utmost
point
where
once
his

lay
his

open
thence
and
as
it
pleased
the
gods
the

soon
bore
them
to

he
high
in
exultation
trod
the

and
at
the
sight
the
welcome
sight
of

shed
many
a

not

he
landed
for

seduced
by

of

golden
talents

from
a
rock
where
he
had
the
year
complete
lest
passing
unperceived
the

should
reassert
his

swift
flew
the

with

to

incontinent
this

of

he
chose
whom
he
in

placed
and

charged
diligent
to
prepare
the

board
with
horses
then
and
chariots
forth
he
drove
with
mischief
and
conducting
home
the
unsuspicious
king
amid
the

slew
him

on

on

i

thy

with

and
sad
no

night
from

along

i
slew

nor

my

so
delightful
thy

sounds
in

thou

where
copious

the
lotus
herbage
of

fairer
than

to

no

all
he
said
the

menelaus
smiled

stroaking
tenderly
his

replied
dear
youth
thy

proclaims
thy

i
can
with

supply
thee
from

suit
thee
better
and
the

of

that
i
possess
which
most

on

at

heard
for
him
they
deem
not
to

gone
but
haply
into
his

for

he
to

this
also
tell

too
for
i
would

took

perforce
thy

away

it
to

at

demand
to

replied
i
gave

what
thou
should
such

petition
for

in

hard
were
it
to

our

yourselves
attend
him
forth
and
with
them
i
observed
mentor
embarking
ruler
them
all
or
if
not
him
a
god
for
such
he
seem
but
this
much
moves
my
wonder
i
saw
at
noble
mentor
here
whom
shipp
for

i
had
seen
before
he
ceas
and
to
his

house
return
they
hearing
sat
aghast
their

finish
the

on

reposed
to

next
much
troubled
spake
a

storm
overcharged
his
bosom
and
his
vivid
eyes
flash
fire
ye
gods
a
proud
exploit
is
here
atchieved
this
voyage
of
telemachus
by
us
pronounced
impracticable
yet
the
boy
in
downright
opposition
to
us
all
hath
headlong
launched
a
ship
and
with
a
band
selected
from
our
bravest
youth
is
gone
he
soon
will
prove
more
mischievous
whose
jove
wither
ere
we
suffer
its
effects
but
give
me
a
swift
bark
with
twenty
rowers
that
watching
his
return
within
the
streights
of
rocky
samos
and
of

i
may
surprise
him
so
shall
he
have
to
seek
his

fatally
for

he
ceased
and
loud
applause
heard
in

with

encouragement
then
rising
all
into

they

filled

and
inarticulate
in

died

till
at

with

she
spake

why
went
my

no

on

swift
ships
to

which
are
to

his

over

went

that
with

his

might
perish
from

for

then
answer
thus
medon
the
wise
return
i
know
not
whether
him
some

or
his

to

there
to
hear
news
of
his

return
or
by
what
fate
at

he
died
if
he
return
no
more
he
said
and
traversing
ulysses
courts
departed
she
with
heart
consuming
woe
no
longer
could
endure
to
take
repose
on
any
of
her
seats
but
on
the
threshold
of
her
lamenting
sat
while
all
her
female
train
around
her
moan
the
antient
and
the
young
whom
sobbing
thus
penelope
bespake
hear
me
ye
maidens
for
of
women
born
coeval
with
me
none
hath
received
such
plenteous
sorrow
from
the
gods
as
i
who
first
my
noble
husband
lost
endued
with
courage
of
all
the
greeks
the
chief
with
virtue
most
adorn
a
prince
whose
glorious
praise
through
hellas
and
all
argos
flew
diffused
and
now
my
darling
son
him
storms
have
far
hence
inglorious
and
i
knew
it
not
ah
servants
conscious
as
ye
were
of
his
design
not
one
of
you
the
thought
conceived
to
wake
me
when
he
went
on
board
for
had
but
the
report
once
reach
my
ear
he
either
had
not
gone
how
much
he
wish
to
leave
me
or
had
left
me
dead
but
haste
ye
bid
my
antient
servant
come
dolion
whom
when
i
left
my
father
house
he
gave
me
and
whose
office
is
to
attend
my
that
he
may
seek
at
once
laertes
and
may
tell
him
all
who
may
contrive
some
remedy
perchance
or
fit
expedient
and
shall
come
abroad
to
weep
before
the
men
who
wish
to
slay
even
the
prince
godlike
ulysses
son
then
thus
the
gentle
euryclea
spake
nurse
of
telemachus
alas
my
queen
slay
me
or
spare
deal
with
me
as
thou
wilt
i
will
confess
the
truth
i
knew
it
all
i
gave
him
all
that
he
required
from
me
both
wine
and
bread
and
at
his
bidding
swore
to
tell
thee
nought
in
twelve
whole
days
to
come
or
till
enquiry
made
thou
thyself
learn
his
departure
lest
thou
impair
thy
lovely
features
with
excess
of
grief
but
lave
thyself
and
fresh
attired
ascend
to
thy
own
chamber
there
with
all
thy
train
to
worship
pallas
who
shall
save
thenceforth
thy
son
from
death
what
ills
he
meet
add
not
fresh
sorrows
to
the
present
woes
of
the
old
king
for
i
believe
not
yet
arcesias
race
entirely
by
the
gods
renounced
but
trust
that
there
shall
still
be
found
among
them
who
shall
dwell
in
royal
state
and
reap
the
fruits
of
fertile
fields
remote
so
saying
she
hush
her
sorrow
and
her
eyes
no
longer
stream
then
bathed
and
fresh
attired
penelope
ascended
with
her
train
the
upper
palace
and
a
basket
stored
with
hallow
cakes
to
pallas
pray
hear
matchless
daughter
of
jove
if
ever
wise
ulysses
offer
here
the
thighs
of
fatted
kine
or
sheep
to
thee
now
mindful
of
his
piety
preserve
his
darling
son
and
frustrate
with
a
frown
the
cruelty
of
these
imperious
guests
she
said
and
wept
aloud
whose
earnest
suit
pallas
received
and
now
the
spacious
hall
and
gloomy
passages
with
tumult
rang
and
clamour
of
that
throng
when
thus
a
youth
insolent
as
his
fellows
dared
to
speak
much
woo
and
long
the
queen
at
length
prepares
to
chuse
another
mate
and
nought
suspects
the
bloody
death
to
which
her
son
is
doom
so
he
but
they
meantime
themselves
untaught
what
course
the
dread
concern
elsewhere
had
taken
whom
antinoüs
thus
address
sirs
one
and
all
i
counsel
you
beware
of
such
bold
boasting
unadvised
lest
one
you
report
your
words
within
no
rather
thus
in
silence
let
us
move
to
an
exploit
so
pleasant
to
us
all
he
said
and
twenty
chose
the
bravest
there
with
whom
he
sought
the
galley
on
the
shore
which
drawing
down
into
the
deep
they
placed
the
mast
and
sails
on
board
and
sitting
next
each
oar
in
order
to
its
proper
groove
unfurl
and
spread
their
canvas
to
the
gale
their
bold
attendants
then
brought
them
their
arms
and
soon
as
in
deep
water
they
had
moor
the
ship
themselves
embarking
supp
on
board
and
watch
impatient
for
the
dusk
of
eve
but
when
penelope
the
palace
stairs
remounting
had
her
upper
chamber
reach
there
unrefresh
with
either
food
or
wine
she
lay
her
down
her
noble
son
the
theme
of
all
her
thoughts
whether
he
should
escape
his
haughty
foes
or
perish
by
their
hands
as
are
the
lion
thoughts
who
sees
not
without
fear
a
multitude
with
toils
encircling
him
around
such
thoughts
her
bosom
occupied
till
sleep
at
length
invading
her
she
sank
in
soft
repose
then
pallas
teeming
with
a
new
design
set
forth
an
airy
phantom
in
the
form
of
fair
iphthima
daughter
of
the
brave
icarius
and
eumelus
wedded
wife
in
pheræ
shaped
like
her
the
dream
she
sent
into
the
mansion
of
the
godlike
chief
ulysses
with
kind
purpose
to
abate
the
sighs
and
tears
of
sad
penelope
the
where
the
bolt
secured
it
at
her
head
the
image
stood
and
thus
in
terms
compassionate
began
thou
distress
penelope
the
gods
happy
in
everlasting
rest
themselves
forbid
thy
sorrows
thou
shalt
yet
behold
thy
son
again
who
hath
by
no
offence
incurr
at
any
time
the
wrath
of
to
whom
in
the
shadowy
gate
by
which
dreams
pass
penelope
replied
what
cause
my
sister
brings
thee
who
art
seen
unfrequent
here
for
that
thou
remote
and
thou
me
a
cessation
too
from
sorrows
and
which
fretting
wear
my
heart
continual
first
my
spouse
i
lost
with
courage
endow
a
prince
whose
praise
through
hellas
and
all
argos
flew
diffused
and
now
my
only
son
new
to
the
toils
and
hazards
of
the
sea
nor
less
untaught
the
arts
of
traffic
in
a
ship
is
gone
far
hence
for
whose
dear
cause
i
sorrow
more
than
for
his
sire
himself
and
even
shake
with
terror
lest
he
perish
by
their
hands
to
whom
he
goes
or
in
the
stormy
deep
for
are
his
foes
and
all
intent
to
slay
him
ere
he
reach
his
home
again
then
answer
thus
the
shadowy
form
return
take
courage
suffer
not
excessive
dread
to
overwhelm
thee
such
a
guide
he
hath
and
guardian
one
whom
many
wish
their
friend
and
ever
at
their
side
knowing
her
minerva
she
compassionates
thy
griefs
and
i
am
here
her
harbinger
who
speak
as
thou
hast
heard
by
her
own
kind
command
then
thus
penelope
the
wise
replied
oh
if
thou
art
a
goddess
and
hast
heard
a
goddess
voice
rehearse
to
me
the
lot
of
that
unhappy
one
if
yet
he

or
if
already
dead

thus

shadow

i
will
not

inform
thee
if
thy
lord
live

not
vain
words
are

unspoken
so
saying
her
egress
swift
beside
the
bolt
she
made
and
melted
into
air
upsprang
from
sleep
icarius
daughter
and
her
heart
felt
heal
within
her
by
that
dream

in

the

for
there
his

then
thus
calypso

from
her
resplendent

august
hermes
possessor
of
the
potent

who
though
by

wherefore

so
saying
the

with
ambrosial
food
her
table

and
with
rosy
juice
nectareous
charged
the
cup
then
ate
and
drank
the
argicide
and
herald
of
the

and
in
his
soul
with
that
repast
divine
refresh
his
message
to
the
nymph
declared
questionest
thou
o
goddess
me
a
god
i
tell
thee
truth
since
such
is
thy
demand
not
willing
but
by
jove
constrain
i
come
for
who
would
voluntary
such
a
breadth
enormous
measure
of
the
salt
expanse
where
city
none
is
seen
in
which
the
gods
are
served
with
chosen
hecatombs
and
but
no
divinity
may
the
designs
elude
or
controvert
of

he
saith
that
here
thou
the
most
distrest
of
all
those

who
nine
years
the

and
that

sack
departed
in

tenth
but
going
thence
offended
pallas
who
with
adverse
winds
opposed
their
voyage
and
with

then
perish
all
his
gallant
friends
but
him
billows
and
storms
drove
hither
jove
commands
that
thou
dismiss
him
hence
without
delay
for
fate
ordains
him
not
to
perish
here
from
all
his
friends
remote
but
he
is
to
see
them
yet
again
and
to
arrive
at
his
own
palace
in
his
native
land
he
said
divine
calypso
at
the
sound
shudder
and
in
wing
accents
thus
replied
ye
are
unjust
ye
gods
and
envious
past
all
others
grudging
if
a
goddess
take
a
mortal
man
openly
to
her
arms
so
when
the
morning
chose
orion
though
ye
live
yourselves
at
ease
yet
ye
all
envied
her
until
the
chaste
diana
from
her
golden
throne
a
silent
shaft
which
slew
him
in
ortygia
so
when
the
ceres
urged
by
passion
took
iäsion
to
her
arms
in
a
fallow
not
untaught
was
jove
that
secret
long
and
hearing
it
indignant
slew
him
with
his
candent
bolt
so
also
o
ye
gods
ye
envy
me
the
mortal
man
my
comfort
him
i
saved
myself
while
solitary
on
his
keel
he
rode
for
with
his
arrow
jove
had
cleft
his
bark
amid
the
sable
deep
then
perish
all
his
gallant
friends
but
him
billows
and
storms
drove
hither
whom
i
sincere
and
fondly
destin
to
a
life
immortal
unobnoxious
to
decay
but
since
no
deity
may
the
designs
elude
or
controvert
of
jove
supreme
hence
with
him
the
barren
deep
if
such
the
will
and
such
his
stern
command
but
undismiss
he
goes
by
me
who
ships
myself
and
mariners
have
none
to
send
with
him
athwart
the
spacious
flood
yet
freely
readily
my
best
advice
i
will
afford
him
that
escaping
all
danger
he
may
regain
his
native
shore
then
hermes
thus
the
messenger
of
act
as
thou
fearing
the
frown
of
jove
lest
if
provoked
he
spare
not
even
thee
so
saying
the
dauntless
argicide
withdrew
and
she
jove
mandate
heard
went
seeking
the
brave
ulysses
on
the
shore
she
found
him
seated
tears
succeeding
tears
delug
his
eyes
while
hopeless
of
return
life
precious
hours
to
eating
cares
he
gave
continual
with
the
nymph
now
charm
no
more
yet
cold
as
she
was
still
he
pass
his
nights
beside
her
in
the
hollow
grot
constrain
and
day
by
day
the
rocks
among
which
lined
the
shore
sat
and
oft
while
wistfully
he
eyed
the
barren
deep
wept
groaned
desponded
sigh
and
wept
again
then
drawing
near
thus
spake
the
nymph
divine
unhappy
weep
not
here
nor
life
consume
in
anguish
go
thou
hast
my
glad
consent
arise
to

them
with
the

which
closely

hence
convey
thee
the
gloomy
deep
bread

and
the
red
grape
cheering

myself
will
put
on

which
shall
preserve
thy
life
from
famine
i
will
also
give
new

and
will
dispatch

but
horror
at
that

the
heart
chill
of
ulysses
and
in
accents
with
wonder
thus
the
noble
chief
replied
ah
other
thoughts
than
of
my
safe
return
employ
thee
goddess
now
who
me
pass
the
perilous
gulph
of
ocean
on

that
wild
expanse
terrible
which
even
ships
pass
not
though
form
to
cleave
their
way
with
ease
and
joyful
in
propitious
winds
from
jove
no
let
me
never
in

of
thee
embark
on

nor
till
thou

o

the
inviolable
oath
that

he
said
calypso
beauteous
goddess
smiled
and
while
she
spake
stroaking
his

replied
thou
dost
asperse
me
rudely
and
excuse
of

hast
none
far
better
taught
what
words
were
these
how
thou
thus
reply
now
hear
me

and
the

hear
too
ye

of
the
stygian
stream
under

by
which
the
blessed
gods
swear
trembling
and
revere
the
awful
oath
that
future
mischief
i
intend
thee
none
no
my
designs
concerning
thee
are
such

conceive
i
have
a

not

my

much

inclined

with
swift

he
as

pursued
within
the
vaulted

oh
canst
thou
thus
resolve
to
seek
incontinent
thy

i
pardon
thee
farewell
but
thou
guess
the
woes
which
fate
ordains
thee
to
endure
ere

here
to

thou
keep
my

engage
thy

day
after

yet
can
i
not
in

myself
suspect
inferior
aught
to

since
competition
can
not
be
between
mere
mortal
beauties
and

not
incensed
i

altogether
yields
to
thee
for
she

immortal
thou
from

not
the

i
wish
my

daily
to

should
some

amid

dash
me

into

shall
bear
also
for

taught
i
have
learned
patience
having
much
endured
by
tempest
and
in

both
come
then
this

also
i

well
prepared

buffetting
the

aside
with

he
mused

a

of
enormous
bulk
hollow
into
an
overwhelming
arch
on

smote
him
as
the

tempestuous
falling
on
some
the
arid
straws
dissipates

flew

a

it
onward
with

urged
an
horse
his

putting

he
bound
his

on
and
prone
into
the

with
palms
prepar
for

fell
neptune
noted
him
he
shook
his
awful
brows
and
in
his
heart
he
said
thus
many
roam
the
flood
till
thou
shalt
mingle
with
a
race
of
men
special
favourites
yet
even
there
fear
not
that
thou
shalt
feel
thy
sorrows

he
said
and
scourging
his
bright
steeds
arrived
at

where
his
glorious
palace
stands
but

beside
she
lull
them
and
enjoin
them
all
to
sleep
but
roused
swift
boreas
and
the
billows
broke
before
ulysses
that
deliver
safe
from
a
dire
death
the
noble
chief
might
mix
with
maritime
phæacia
sons
renown
two
nights

wander
and
two
days
the

tempestuous
death
expecting
hour
but
when
aurora
had
brought
the
third
day
to
a
close
then
ceas
the
wind
and
breathless
came
a
calm
he
nigh
at
hand
the
shore
beheld
darting
acute
his
sight
toward
it
from
a
billow
top
precious
as
to
his
children
seems
the
life
of
some
fond
father
through
disease
long
time
and
pain
stretch
languid
on
his
couch
the
prey
of
some
vindictive
but
now
at
last
by
gracious
to
ease
and
health
restored
so
grateful
to
ulysses
sight
forests
and
hills
impatient
with
his
feet
to
press
the
shore
he
swam
but
when
within
such
distance
as
a
shout
may
fly
he
came
the
thunder
of
the
sea
against
the
rocks
then
smote
his
ear
for
hoarse
the
billows
on
the
firm
land
belch
horrible
abroad
and
the
salt
spray
dimm
all
things
to
his
view
for
neither
port
for
ships
nor
cove
was
there
but
the
rude
coast
a
headland
bluff
presented
rocks
and
craggy
masses
huge
then
hope
and
strength
exhausted
both
the
chief
and
in
his
noble
heart
complain
alas
though
jove
hath
given
me
to
behold
unhoped
the
land
again
and
i
have
pass
furrowing
my
way
these
waves
there
seems
no
egress
from
the
hoary
flood
for
me
sharp
stones
hem
in
the
waters
wild
the
surge
raves
where
and
smooth
the
rocks
arise
deep
also
is
the
shore
on
which
my
feet
no
standing
gain
or
chance
of
safe
escape
what
if
some
billow
catch
me
from
the
deep
emerging
and
against
the
pointed
rocks
dash
me
conflicting
with
its
force
in
vain
but
should
i
swimming
trace
the
coast
in
search
of
sloping
beach
haven
or
shelter
creek
i
fear
lest
groaning
i
be
snatch
again
by
stormy
gusts
into
the
fishy
deep
or
lest
some
monster
of
the
flood
receive
command
to
seize
me
of
the
many
such
by
the
illustrious
amphitrite
bred
for
that
the
mighty
shaker
of
the
shores
hates
me
implacable
too
well
i
know
while
such
discourse
within
himself
he
held
a
huge
wave
heav
him
on
the
rugged
coast
where
flay
his
flesh
had
been
and
all
his
bones
broken
together
but
for
the
infused
good
counsel
of
minerva
with
both
hands
suddenly
he
seized
the
rock
and
groaning
clench
it
till
the
billow
pass
so
baffled
he
that
wave
but
yet
again
the
refluent
flood
rush
on
him
and
with
force
resistless
dash
him
far
into
the
sea
as
pebbles
to
the
hollow
polypus
extracted
from
his
stony
bed
adhere
so
he
the
rough
rocks
clasping
stripp
his
hands
raw
and
the
billows
now
whelm
him
again
then
had
the
hapless
hero
premature
perish
but
for
sagacity
inspired
by
pallas
forth
from
the
waves
emerging
where
the
surf
burst
on
the
rocks
he
coasted
looking
landward
as
he
swam
the
shore
with
hope
of
port
or
level
beach
but
when
still
swimming
to
the
mouth
he
came
of
a
river
there
he
safest
th
ascent
for
it
was
by
rocks
and
shelter
close
from
wind
he
felt
the
current
and
thus
ardent
pray
o
hear
thy
name
who
this
river
at
whose
mouth
from
all
the
threats
of
neptune
with
rapture
i
arrive
even
the
immortal
gods
the
respect
and
such
am
i
who
reach
at
length
thy
stream
and
clasp
thy
knees
after
long
toil
i
am
thy
suppliant
oh
king
pity
me
he
said
the
river
god
at
once
his
current
and
it
ceas
smooth
he
prepared
the
way
before
ulysses
and
the
land
vouchsafed
him
easy
at
his
channel
mouth
there
once
again
he
bent
for
ease
his
limbs
both
arms
and
knees
in
conflict
with
the
floods
exhausted
swoln
his
body
was
all
and
from
his
mouth
and
nostrils
stream
the
brine
breathless
and
speechless
and
of
life
well
nigh
bereft
he
lay
through
dreadful
toil
immense
but
when
revived
his
dissipated
he
recollected
loosing
from
beneath
his
breast
the
zone
divine
he
cast
it
far
into
the
brackish
stream
and
a
huge
wave
returning
bore
it
downward
to
the
sea
where
ino
caught
it
then
the
river
brink
abandoning
among
the
rushes
prone
he
lay
kiss
oft
the
soil
and
sighing
said
ah
me
what
must
i
now
sustain
what
doom
at
last
awaits
me
if
i
watch
this
woeful
night
here
at
the
river
side
what
hope
but
that
the
frost
and
copious
dews
weak
as
i
am
my
remnant
small
of
life
shall
quite
extinguish
and
the
chilly
air
breath
from
the
river
at
the
dawn
of
day
but
if
ascending
this
declivity
i
gain
the
woods
and
in
some
thicket
sleep
if
sleep
indeed
can
find
me
and
then
i
have
cause
to
fear
lest
i
be
torn
by
wild
beasts
and
devour
long
time
he
mused
but
at
the
last
his
course
bent
to
the
woods
which
not
remote
he
saw
from
the
conspicuous
on
a
hill
arrived
between
two
neighbour
shrubs
he
crept
both

the

covert
which
nor
rough
winds
blowing
moist
could
penetrate
nor
could
the

smite
through
it
or
unceasing
pervade
so
thick

ample

close
interwoven
under

the
chief
retiring
with
industrious
hands
a
bed
collected
broad
of

which
there
he
found
abundant
strew
such
store
as
had
sufficed
two
travellers
or
three
for
warm
though

roughest
blasts
had
rag

that
bed
with
joy
the
chief
contemplated
and
occupying
soon
the

it
high
with

as
when
some

haste

all
purified

could
now
be
seen

spread
the

orderly
along

had
cleansed

and
smoothing
with

their

again

mused
how

thus
the

ah
me
what
mortal
race

here
rude

they
contumacious

who
fear

myself
go

so
forth
he
went
as

forth

of
his
strength
whom
winds
have
vex
and
rains
fire
fills
his
eyes
and
whether
herds

woodland
deer
he
find
he
rends
them
and
adust
for
blood
abstains
not
even
from
the
guarded
fold
such
sure
to
seem
in
virgin
eyes
the

all
naked

him
foul
with

fled
all

from

all

expected
him

doubtful
stood

to
implore
the

her

this

terms

the

should
that
bolder
course
resent
then
gentle
thus
and
he
spake
oh
queen
thy
earnest
suppliant
i
approach
art
thou
some
goddess
or
of
mortal
race
for
if
some
goddess
and
from
heaven
arrived
diana
then
daughter
of
mighty
jove
i
deem
thee
most
for
such
as
hers
appear
thy
form
thy
stature
and
thy
air
divine
but
if
of
mortal
race
thou
dwell
below
thrice
happy
then
thy
parents
i
account
and
happy
thrice
thy
brethren
ah
the
joy
which
always
for
thy
sake
their
bosoms
fill
when
thee
they
view
all
lovely
as
thou
art
majestic
on
the
graceful

but
him
beyond
all

blest
i

the

who
wealthier

his
rich

shall
win
and
lead
thee
to
his
honour
home
for
never
with
these

a
mortal
form
beheld
i
comparable
aught
to
thine
in
man
or
woman
i
gaze
such
erst
in
delos
i
beheld
a
palm
beside
the
altar
of
apollo
tall
and
growing
still
for
thither
too
i
sail
and
were
my
followers
in
a
voyage
ordain
my
ruin
and
as
then
i
that
palm
long
time
amazed
for
never
grew
so
strait
a
shaft
so
lovely
from
the
ground
so
princess
thee
with
wonder
i
behold
charm
into
fixt
astonishment
by
awe
alone
forbidden
to
embrace
thy

for
i
am
one
on
whom
much
woe
hath
yesterday
i
escaped
the

day
of
my
distress
by

the
dreary
deep
for
all
those

the

and
rapid
storms
bore
me
along
impetuous
from
the

ogygia
till
at
length
the
will
of
cast
me
that
i
might
also
here
sustain
affliction
on
your
shore
for
rest
i
think
is
not
for
me
no
the
immortal
gods
have
much
to
accomplish
ere
that
day
arrive
but
oh
queen
pity
me
who
after
long
calamities
endured
of
all
who
live
thee
first
approach
nor
mortal
know
beside
of
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
land
shew
me
your

give
me
although
coarse
some
if

canst
give
and
may
the

thy

grant

for

all
the

none
i

their

bring

therefore
food
and
wine
my

for
the

regale
and
lave
him
where

most
she
spake
they
stood
and
by
each
other
words
encouraged
placed
ulysses
where

next
the
limpid
oil
presenting
to

in

exhorted
him
to

then
the

thus
bespake
ye

stand
apart
that
i
may
cleanse
myself
my
shoulders
from
the
briny
surf
and
give
them
oil
which
they
have
wanted
long
but
in
your
presence
i
bathe
not
ashamed
to
show
myself
uncloath
to
female
eyes
he
said
they
went
and
to
nausicaa
told
his
answer
then
the
hero
in
the
stream
his
shoulders
laved
and
loins
incrusted
rough
with
the
salt
spray
and
with
his
hands
the

of
the
wild
ocean
from
his

express
thus
wash
all
over
and
refresh
with
oil
he
put
the
garments
on

dilated

from

viewing

with
amazement
his

and
her
damsels
thus
bespake
my

listen
to
my
voice
not
hated
sure
by
all
above
this
man
among
phæacia
godlike
sons
arrives
at
first
i
deem
him
of
plebeian
sort
dishonourable
but
he
now
assumes
a
near
resemblance
to
the
gods
above
ah
would
to
heaven
it
were
my
lot
to
call

some
native
of

my

give
him

ended
they
obedient
to
her

both
wine
and
food
dispatchful
placed
and
glad
before
ulysses
he
rapacious
ate

lived
from

long
time
estranged
on

meantime
intent
her

neat
the

placed

then
yoked
the

and
to
her

herself
ascending
ulysses
to

and
thus
she
spake
up
stranger
seek
the
city
i
will
lead
thy
steps
toward
my
royal
father
house
where
all
phæacia
nobles
thou
shalt
see
but
thou
for
i
account
thee
not
unwise
this
course
pursue
while
through
the
fields
we
pass
and
labours
of
the
rural
hind
so
long
with
my
attendants
follow
fast
the
mules
and
i
will
be
thy
guide
but
once
the
summit
gain
on
which
is
built
our
city
with
proud
bulwarks
fenced
around
and
laved
on
both
sides
by
its
pleasant
port
of
narrow
entrance
where
our
gallant
barks
line
all
the
road
each
station
in
her
place
and
where
adjoining
close
the
splendid
fane
of
neptune
stands
the
forum
with
huge
stones
from
quarries
thither
drawn
constructed
strong
in
which
the
rigging
of
their
barks
they
keep
and
cordage
and
make
smooth
their
oars
for
bow
and
quiver
the
phæacian
race
heed
not
but
masts
and
oars
and
ships
with
which
exulting
they
divide
the
flood
then
cautious
i
would
shun
their
bitter
taunts
disgustful
lest
they
mock
me
as
i
pass
for
of
the
meaner
people
some
are
coarse
in
the
extreme
and
it
may
chance
that
one
the
basest
there
seeing
us
shall
exclaim
what
handsome
stranger
of
athletic
form
attends
the
princess
where
had
she
the
chance
to
find
him
we
shall
see
them
wedded
soon
either
she
hath
received
some
vagrant
guest
from
distant
lands
for
no
land
neighbours
ours
or
by
her
incessant
won
some
god
hath
left
the
to
be
for
ever
hers
is
well
if
she
have
found
by
her
own
search
an
husband
for
herself
since
she
accounts
the
nobles
of
phæacia
who
her
hand
solicit
worthy
to
be
scorn
thus
will
they
speak
injurious
i
should
blame
a
virgin
guilty
of
such
conduct
much
myself
who
reckless
of
her
parents
will
should
so
familiar
with
a
man
consort
ere

of

rites
but
mark

following
my

thou
shalt

the

which
we
shall
reach
ere

within
that
grove
a

it
my

farm

there
and
his

reach
it
from

till
in

we
gain
my

when

bids
suppose

then
thou
the

ask
where
alcinoüs
dwells
my
valiant
sire
well
known
is
his
abode
so
that
with
ease
a
child
might
lead
thee
to
it
for
in
nought
the
other
houses
of
our

the
house
resemble
in
which
dwells
the
hero

alcinoüs
once
within

received
pause
not

with
swift

advancing
seek
my

so

thou

win
a
glad

to
thy

however

the
story
of
my
woes
for
i
have
from

i
will
answer
thee
as
best
i
may
there
is
a
certain

ogygia
placed

distant
in

there
dwells
by

deeply
in

terrible
in

alone
my

miserable
inmate
made
when

had
asunder
with

my

in

there
perish
all
the
valiant

i
my

night
with
folded

nine
days
was
borne
along
but
on
the
tenth
dark
night
as

gods
they
drove
me
to
ogygia
where
resides
calypso
beauteous
nymph
dreadful
in

me
and
her
wish
was
to
confer
on

for
ever
from

sap
of

not

i
there
abode

my
ambrosial
robes

but
when
at

years
elaps
the
circling
eighth
arrived
she
then
herself
my
quick
departure
thence
advised
by
jove
own
mandate
overaw
which
even
her
had
influenced
to
a
change
on
a
raft
she
sent
me
forth
with
presents
bread
she
put
and
wine
on
board
and
cloath
me
in
immortal
robes
she
sent
before
me
also
a
fair
wind
but
not
days
i
sail
the
flood
continual
and
descried
on
the
eighteenth
your
shadowy
mountains
tall
when
my
exulting
heart
sprang
at
the
sight
all
wretched
as
i
was
and
still
to
strive
with
difficulties
many
and
hard
from
adverse
neptune

the
stormy
winds
exciting
opposite
my

impeded
and
the

immeasurable
such
as

of

my
only
hope
for
her
the

scatter
and
myself
this
ocean
measur
swimming
till
the
winds
and
mighty
waters
cast
me
on
your
shore
me
there
emerging
the
huge
waves
had
full
on
the
land
where
incommodious
most
the
shore
presented
only
roughest
rocks
but
leaving
it
i
swam
the
deep
again
till
now
at
last
a
river
gentle
stream
receiv
me
by
no
rocks
deform
and
where
no
violent
winds
the
shelter
bank
annoy
i
flung
myself
on
shore
exhausted
weak
needing
repose
ambrosial
night
came
on
when
from
the
stream
withdrawn
i
in
a
thicket
lay
me
down
on
leaves
which
i
had
heap
together
and
the
gods
my
with
a
flood
of
sleep
there
under
wither
leaves
forlorn
i
slept
all
the
long
night
the
morning
and
the
noon
but
balmy
sleep
at
the
decline
of
day
broke
from
me
then
your
daughter
train
i
heard
sporting
with
whom
she
also
sported
fair
and
graceful
as
the
gods
to
her
i
kneel
she
following
the
dictates
of
a
mind
ingenuous
pass
in
her
behaviour
all
which
even
ye
could
from
an
age
like
hers
have
hoped
for
youth
is
ever
indiscrete
she
gave
me
plenteous
food
with
richest
wine
refresh
my
spirit
taught
me
where
to
bathe
and
cloath
me
as
thou
seest
thus
though
a
prey
to
many
sorrows
i
have
told
thee
truth
to
whom
alcinoüs
answer
thus
return
my
daughter
conduct
i
perceive
hath
been
in
this
erroneous
that
she
led
thee
not
hither
at
once
with
her
attendant
train
for
thy
first
suit
was
to
herself
alone
thus
then
ulysses
wary
chief
replied
blame
not
o
hero
for
so
slight
a
cause
thy
faultless
child
she
bade
me
follow
them
but
i
refused
by
fear
and
awe
restrain
lest
thou
feel
displeasure
at
that
sight
thyself
for
we
are
all
in
clime
suspicious
and
to
worst
constructions
prone
so
spake
ulysses
to
whom
thus
the
king
i
bear
not
stranger
in
my
breast
an
heart
causeless
irascible
for
at
all
times
a
equanimity
is
best
and
oh
i
would
to
that
being
such
as
now
thou
art
and
of
one
mind
with
me
thou
accept
my
daughter
become
my
and
dwell
contented
here
house
would
i
give
thee
and
possessions
too
were
such
thy
choice

if
thou
chuse
it
not
no
man
in
all
phæacia
shall
by

detain
thee
jupiter
himself
forbid
for

i
will
appoint
thee
convoy
hence
and
while
thou
by
sleep
subdued
shalt
on
thy
bed
repose
they
with
their
oars
shall
brush
the
placid
flood
till
thou
arrive
at

or
at
what

though
far
more

tityus
to
that
isle
they
went
they
reach
it
and
they
brought
him
thence
back
to

in

with
ease
thou
also
shalt
be
taught
what

i
boast

how

my

excel
upturning
with
their

the

he
ceas
ulysses
his
words
exulting
heard

praying
thus
replied
eternal

may
the

perform
his
whole
kind
promise
grant
him
in
all
lands
a

and
grant
to
me
to
visit
safe
my
native

again
thus
they
conferr
and
now
areta
bade
her
fair
attendants
dress
a
fleecy
couch
under
the
portico
with
purple
rugs
resplendent
and
with
arras
spread
beneath
and
over
all
with
cloaks
of
shaggy
pile
forth
went
the
maidens
bearing
each
a
torch
and
as
she
bade
prepared
in
haste
a
couch
of
depth
commodious
then
returning
gave
ulysses
welcome
summons
to
repose
stranger
thy
couch
is
spread
hence
to
thy
rest
so
they
thrice
grateful
to
his
soul
the
thought
seem
of

there
slept
ulysses
then
on
his
carv
couch
beneath
the

in

the

that
at
my

ye
may

short
feast
for
which
myself
will

but
as
for
those
of
sceptred
rank
i
bid
them
all
alike
to
my

board
that
here
we
may
regale
the

nobly
and
let
none
refuse

too
demodocus
the
bard
divine
to
share
my
banquet
whom
the
gods
have
blest
with
of
song
delectable
by
any
when
his
genius
once
is
fired
he
ceas
and
led
the

whom
follow
all
the
sceptred
senators
while
to
the
house
an
herald
hasted
of
the
bard

then
fifty
mariners
and
two
from
all
the
rest
selected
to
the
coast
repair
and
from
her
station
on
the
launched

down
into
the
sacred
deep
they
placed
the
canvas
and
the
mast
on
board
arranged
the
oars
unfurl
the
shining
sail
and
leaving
her
in
depth
of
water
moor
all
sought
the
palace
of
alcinoüs
there
soon
the
portico
the
court
the
hall
were
fill
with
multitudes
of
young
and
old
for
whose
regale
the
mighty
monarch
slew
two
beeves
twelve
sheep
and
twice
four
fatted
brawns
they
slay
them
first
then
busily
their
task
prepared
the
joyous
feast
and
now
the
herald
came
leading
with
care
the
tuneful
bard
dear
to
the
muse
was
he
who
yet
appointed
him
both
good
and
ill
took
from
him
sight
but
gave
him
strains
divine
for
him
pontonoüs
in
the
midst
disposed
an
throne
thrusting
it
close
to
a
tall
column
where
he
hung
his
lyre
above
his
head
and
taught
him
where
it
hung
he
set
before
him
next
a
polish
board
and
basket
and
a
goblet
fill
with
wine
for
his
own
use
and
at
his
own
command
then
all
assail
at
once
the
ready
feast
and
when
nor
hunger
more
nor
thirst
they
felt
then
came
the
muse
and
roused
the
bard
to
sing
exploits
of
men
renown
it
was
a
song
in
that
day
to
the
highest
extoll
he
sang
of
a
dispute
kindled
between
the
son
of
peleus
and
laertes
son
both
seated
at
a
feast
held
to
the
gods
that
contest
agamemnon

of

between
the
noblest
of
achaia
host

rejoiced
for
when
in
pytho
erst
he
pass
the
marble
threshold
to
consult
the
oracle
of
apollo
such
dispute
the
voice
divine
had
to
his
ear
announced
for
then
it
was
that
first
the
storm
of
war
came
rolling
on
ordain
long
time
to
afflict
troy
and
the
greecians
by
the
will
of
jove
so
sang
the
bard
illustrious
then
his
robe
of
purple
dye
with
both
hands
his
head
ulysses
drew
behind
its
ample
folds
veiling
his
face
through
fear
to
be
observed
by
the
phæacians
weeping
at
the
song
and
ever
as
the
bard
harmonious
ceased
he
wiped
his
tears
and
drawing
from
his
brows
the
mantle
pour
libation
to
the
gods
but
when
the
chiefs
for
they
delighted
heard
those
sounds
solicited
again
the
bard
and
he
renew
the
strain
then
close
his
as
before
ulysses
wept
thus
unperceiv
by
all
the
hero

save
by

and
his
deep
sighs

phæacians
thus
bespake
phæacia
chiefs
and
senators
attend
we
have
regaled
sufficient
and
the
harp
heard
to
satiety
companion
sweet
and
seasonable
of
the
festive
hour
now
go
we
forth
for
honourable
proof
of
our
address
in
games
of
kind
that
this
our

that
none
like

have
to
leap
to
box
to
wrestle
and
to
run
so
saying
he
led
them
forth
whose
steps
the
guests
all
follow
and
the
herald
hanging
high
the
sprightly
lyre
took
by
his
hand
the
bard

he

address

ask
we
now
the
stranger
if
he
boast
proficiency
in
aught
his
figure
seems
not
ill
in

legs
and
arms
he
shews
much
strength
and
in
his

left
him

with
troubles

nor

in

so
sure
to
break
the

then
answer
thus
euryalus

thou

said
laodamas

approaching
speak
to
him

call
him
forth

when
alcinoüs
noble
offspring
heard
advancing
from
his
seat
amid
them
all
he
stood
and
to
ulysses
thus
began
stand
forth
oh
guest
thou
also
prove
thy
skill
if
any
such
thou
hast
in
games
like
ours
which
likeliest
thou
hast
learn
for
greater
praise
hath
no
man
while
he
lives
than
that
he
know
his
feet
to
exercise
and
hands
aright
come
then
make
trial
scatter
wide
thy
cares
we
will
not
hold
thee
long
the
ship
is
already
and
the
crew
stand
all
prepared
to
whom
replied
the
wily
chief
wherefore
as
in
derision
have
ye
me
forth
laodamas
to
these
exploits
no
games
have
i
but
many
a
grief
at
heart
and
with
far
other
struggles
worn
here
sit
desirous
only
of
conveyance
home
for
which
both
king
and
people
i
implore
then
him
euryalus
aloud
reproach
i
well
believ
it
friend
in
thee
the
guise
i
see
not
of
a
man
expert
in
feats
athletic
of
which
various
are
in

thou
rather
with
ships
familiar
one
accustom
to
controul
some
crew
of
trading
mariners
in
stowage
pilotage
and
wealth
acquired
by
rapine
but
of
no
gymnastic
to
whom
ulysses
frowning
dark
replied
thou
hast
ill
spoken
sir
and
like
a
man
regardless
whom
he
wrongs
therefore
the
gods
give
not
endowments
graceful
in
each
kind
of
body
mind
and
all
to
one
this
man
in

less

yet
jove
crowns
him
with

his

behold
him
while
with
modest
confidence
he
bears
the
prize
of
fluent
speech
from
all
and
in
the
streets
is
gazed
on
as
a
god
another
in
his

the

no

around
his

so
thou
in

to
boast
a

to
make
a

produce

such
as
thine
yet
hast
thou
an
untutor
intellect
thou
much
hast
moved
me
thy
unhandsome
phrase
hath
roused
my
wrath
i
am
not
as
thou
a
novice
in
these
sports
but
took
the
lead
in
all
while
youth
and
strength
were
on
my
side
but
i
am
now
in
bands
of
sorrow
held
and
of
misfortune
having
much
endured
in
war
and
buffeting
the
waves
yet
though
with

i
will
essay
my

among

to

all
those
transcending

from

sent
it
loud
sang
the
stone
and
as
it
flew
the
maritime
phæacians
low
inclined
their
heads
beneath
it
over
all
the
marks
and
far
beyond

sped
the
flying

aloud
exclaim
stranger
the

with

thy

disdains

with
a

borne

beyond

not

phæacian
none

reach
thy

much
less
overcast
she
ceased
ulysses
hardy
chief
rejoiced
that
in

he
had
found
a
judge
so
favorable
and
with
brisker
tone
as
less
in
wrath
the
multitude
address
young
men
reach
this
and
i
will
quickly
heave
another
such
or
yet
a
heavier
quoit
then
come
the
man
whose
courage
prompts
him
forth
to
box
to
wrestle
with
me
or
to
run
for
ye
have
chafed
me
much
and
i
decline
no
strife
with
any
here
but
challenge
all
phæacia
save
laodamas
alone
he
is
mine
host
who
combats
with
his
friend
to
call
to
proof
of
hardiment
the
man
who
entertains
him
in
a
foreign
land
would
but
evince
the
challenger
a
fool
who
so
would
cripple
his
own
interest
there
as
for
the
rest
i
none
refuse
scorn
none
but
wish
for
trial
of
you
and
to
match
in
opposition
fair
my
force
with
yours
there
is
no
game
athletic
in
the
use
of
all
mankind
too
difficult
for
me
i
handle
well
the
polish
bow
and
first
amid
a
thousand
foes
strike
whom
i
mark
although
a
throng
of
warriors
at
my
side
imbattled
speed
their
shafts
at
the
same
time
of
all
achaia
sons
who
erst
at
troy
drew
bow
the
sole
who
bore
the
prize
from
me
was
philoctetes
i
resign
it
else
to
none
now
nourish
with
the
fruits
of
earth
yet
mean
i
no
comparison
of
myself
with
men
of
antient
times
with
hercules
or
with
oechalian
eurytus
who
both
the
gods
themselves
in
archery
defied
soon
therefore
died
huge
eurytus
ere
yet
old
age
he
reach
him
angry
to
be
to
proof
of

apollo
slew
but
if
ye
name
the
spear
mine
flies
a
length
by
no
man
arrow
reach
i
fear
no
foil
from
the
phæacians
save
in
speed
alone
for
i
have
suffer
hardships
dash
and
by
many
a
wave
nor
had
i
food
on
board
at
all
times
therefore
i
am
much
unstrung
he
spake
and
silent
the
phæacians
sat
of
whom
alone
alcinoüs
thus
replied
since
stranger
not
ungraceful
is
thy
speech
who
hast
but
vindicated
in
our
ears
thy
question
prowess
angry
that
this
youth
reproach
thee
in
the
presence
of
us
all
that
no
man
qualified
to
give
his
voice
in
public
might
affront
thy
courage
more

mark
me
therefore
that
in
time
to
come
while
feasting
with
thy
children
and
thy
spouse
thou
inform
the
heroes
of
thy

even
of
our
proficiency
in
arts
by
jove
enjoin
us
in
our
father
days
we
boast
not
much
the
boxer
skill
nor
yet
the
wrestler
but
in

our
pleasures
are
the

garments
for

come
ye
phæacians
beyond

to
tread
the

with

before
us
that
our

arrived
in
his

may
inform
his

how
far
in

all
excel
in

in
the

bring
ye
to

in

so
spake
the
godlike
king
at
whose
command
the

to

palace
quick
to
seek
the
charming
lyre
meantime
arose
nine
arbiters
appointed
to
intend
the
whole
arrangement
of
the
public
games
to
smooth
the
circus
floor
and
give
the
ring
its
compass
widening
the
attentive

ere
long
the
herald
came
bearing
the
harp
with
which
demodocus
supplied
advanced
into
the

stood
blooming

the
ceaseless
play

admired
then
tuning
his
sweet
chords
demodocus
a
jocund
strain
began
his
theme
the
loves
of
mars
and
cytherea
how
first
clandestine
they
embraced
beneath
the
roof
of
vulcan

by
many
a

with

of
their
amorous
sport
bore
swift
the
tale
to
vulcan
he
apprized
of
that
foul
deed
at
once
his
smithy
sought
in
secret
darkness
of
his
inmost
soul
contriving
vengeance
to
the

he
forged
a
snare
of

indissoluble
by
no

the
net
prepared
he
bore
it
to
his

and
his

couch
where
stretching
them
from
post
to

he
with
those
fine
meshes
all
his

around

hung
them
from
the
roof
diffused
like
spiders

which
not

themselves
could
see
so

the
toils
when
thus

but
seeing
that
the
famed
artificer
of

left

flew
to
the
house
of

hot
to
enjoy
the
goddess

lo
thine

from

to
lemnos
gone
and
to
the
sintians
men
of
speech
he
spake
nor
she
was
loth
but
bedward
too
like
him
inclined
so
then
to
bed
they
went
and
as
they
lay

down
down

the
net
around
them
labour
exquisite
of
hands
by
ingenuity

inform
small
room

found
so
prison
not
a
limb
could
either

felt
at

entanglement
from
which
was
no
escape
and
now
the
glorious
artist
ere

yet
had
reach
the
lemnian
isle
limping
from
his
feign
journey
for
his
spy
the
sun

told
him
all
with
aching

standing
in

frantic
with
indignation
roar

roar
again
summoning
all
the
oh
jove

all

hither
look
that
ye
may
view
a
sight
ludicrous
yet
too
monstrous
to
be
borne
how
venus
always
with
dishonour
loads
her
cripple
spouse
doating
on
fiery
mars
and
wherefore
for
that
he
is
fair
in
form
and
sound
of

i
and
weak
whose
fault
is
this
their
fault
and
theirs

who
gave

where
they

together
on
my

lascivious
ah
sight
hateful
to
my

yet
cooler
wishes

they
feel
i
ween
to
press
my
bed
hereafter
here
to
sleep
will
little
please
them
fondly
as
they
love
but
these
my

will
suffice
to
hold
them
here
till
jove
shall
yield
me
back

the
sum
of
all
my

for
respect

he
ended
then
apollo
with
full
force
rush
on

and
he
began
what

first
firing
their

all
their

for

sons
themselves
had
drawn
it
to
the
citadel
and
there
the
mischief
stood
then
strife
arose
among
the
trojans
compassing
the
horse
and
threefold
was
the
doubt
whether
to
cleave
the
hollow
trunk
asunder
or
updrawn
aloft
to
cast
it
headlong
from
the
rocks
or
to
permit
the
enormous
image
kept
entire
to
stand
an
to
the
gods
which
was
their
destined
course
for
fate
had
their
ruin
sure
when
once
they
had
received
within
their
walls
that
engine
huge
in
which
sat
all
the
bravest
greecians
with
the
fate
of
ilium
charged
and
slaughter
of
her
sons
he
sang
how
from
the
horse
effused
the
greeks
left
their
capacious
ambush
and
the
town
made
desolate
to
others
in
his
song
he
gave
the
praise
of
wasting
all
beside
but
told
how
fierce
as
mars
ulysses
with
godlike
menelaus
to
the
house
flew
of
deiphobus
him
there
engaged
in
direst
fight
he
sang
and
through
the
aid
of
glorious
pallas
over
all
so
sang
the
bard
illustrious
at
whose
song
ulysses
melted
and
tear
after
tear
fell
on
his
cheeks
as
when
a
woman
weeps
her
husband
who
hath
fallen
in
defence
of
his
own
city
and
his
babes
before
the
gates
she
sinking
folds
him
in
her
arms
and
gazing
on
him
as
he
pants
and
dies
shrieks
at
the
sight
meantime
the
enemy
smiting
her
shoulders
with
the
spear
to
toil
command
her
and
to
bondage
far
away
and
her
cheek
fades
with
horror
at
the
sound
ulysses
so
from
his
moist
lids
let
fall
the
frequent
tear
unnoticed
by
the
rest
those
drops
but
not
by
king
alcinoüs
fell

seated
at
his

heavy

and
the

thus

let
demodocus
enjoin
his

silence
for
not

grateful
to
all
his

during

and
since
the
bard
divine
began
continual
flow
the
stranger
sorrows
by
remembrance
caused
of
some
great
woe
which
wraps
his
soul
around
then
let
the
bard
suspend
his
song
that
all
as
most
befits
th
occasion
may
rejoice
both
guest
and

together
since

seems
thy
thoughts
hast
turn
to
ask
me
whence
my
groans
and
tears
that
i
may
sorrow
still
the
more
what
first
what
next
what
last
shall
i
rehearse
on
whom
the
gods
have
such
various
woes
learn
first
my
name
that
even
in
this
land
remote
i
may
be
known
and
that
escaped
from
all
adversity
i
may
requite
hereafter
this
your
hospitable
care
at
my
own
home
however
distant
hence
i
am
ulysses
fear
in
all
the
earth
for
subtlest
wisdom
and
renown
to
heaven
the
offspring
of
laertes
my
abode
is
ithaca
there
waving
stands
the
mountain
neritus
his
boughs
and
it
is
neighbour
close
by
isles
all
populous
thence
samos
is
beheld
dulichium
and
zacynthus
flat
on
the
deep
she
lies
farthest
removed
toward
the
west
while
situate
apart
her
sister
islands
face
the
rising
day
rugged
she
is
but
fruitful
nurse
of
sons
magnanimous
nor
shall
these
eyes
behold
elsewhere
an
object
dear
and
sweet
as
she
calypso
beauteous
goddess

me
wishing

ææan
circe
also
skill
profound
in
potent
arts
within
her
palace
long
detain
me
wishing
me
her
own
espoused
but
never
could
they
warp
my
constant
mind
so
much
our
parents
and
our
native
soil
attract
us
most
even
although
our
lot
be
fair
and
plenteous
in
a
foreign
land
but
come
my
painful
voyage
such
as
jove
gave
me
from
ilium
i
will
now
relate
from
troy
the
winds
bore
me
to
ismarus
city
of
the
ciconians
them
i
slew
and
laid
their
city
waste
whence
bringing
forth
much
spoil
with
all
their
wives
i
portion
it
with
equal
hand
and
each
received
a
share
next
i
exhorted
to
immediate
flight
my
people
but
in
vain
they
madly
my
sober
counsel
and
much
wine
they
drank
and
sheep
and
beeves
slew
on
the
shore
meantime
ciconians
to
ciconians
call
their
neighbours
summoning
a
mightier
host
and
braver
natives
of
the
continent
expert
on
horses
mounted
to
maintain
fierce
fight
or
if
occasion
bade
on
foot
they
came
as
leaves
or
vernal
at
then
by
the
decree
of
jove
misfortune
found
us
at
the
ships
we
stood
piercing
each
other
with
the
brazen
spear
and
till
the
morning
brighten
into
noon
few
as
we
were
we
yet
withstood
them
all
but
when
the
sun
verged
westward
then
the
greeks
fell
back
and
the
ciconian
host
prevail
six
warlike
greecians
from
each
galley
crew
perish
in
that
dread
field
the
rest
escaped
thus
after
loss
of
many
we
pursued
our
course
yet
difficult
as
was
our
flight
went
not
till
first
we
had
invoked
by
name
our
friends
whom
the
ciconians
had
destroy
but
jove
assail
us
soon
with
a
tempestuous
earth
alike
and
sea
with
storms
he
overhung
and
night
fell
fast
from
their
heads
oft
our
gallies
flew
and
rent
and
rent
again
our
tatter
crackled
in
the
wind
we
fearing
instant
death
within
the
barks
our
canvas
lodg
and
toiling
strenuous
at
length
the
continent
two
nights
we
lay
continual
there
and
two
long
days
consumed
with
toil
and
grief
but
when
the
beauteous
morn
had
brought
the
third
day
to
a
close
our
masts
erected
and
white
sails
unfurl
again
we
sat
on
board
meantime
the
winds
well
managed
by
the
steersman
urged
us
on
and
now
all
danger
pass
i
had
attain
my
native
shore
but
doubling
in
my
course
malea
waves
and
currents
and
constrain
me
devious
to
cythera
isle
nine
days
by
cruel
storms
thence
was
i
borne
athwart
the
fishy
deep
but
on
the
tenth
reach
the
lotophagi
a
race
on
sweetest
fruit
alone
there
quitting
ship
we
landed
and
drew
water
and
the
crews
beside
the
vessels
took
their
cheer
when
hasty
we
had
thus
our
strength
renew
i
order
forth
my
people
to
inquire
two
i
selected
from
the
rest
with
whom
i
join
an
herald
third
what
race
of
men
might
there
inhabit
they
departing
with
the
lotophagi
nor
hostile
aught
or
savage
the
lotophagi
devised
against
our
friends
but
offer
to
their
taste
the
lotus
of
which
fruit
what
man
once
tasted
no
desire
felt
he
to
come
with
tidings
back
or
seek
his
country
more
but
rather
wish
to
feed
on
lotus
still
with
the
lotophagi
and
to
renounce
all
thoughts
of
home
them
therefore
i
weeping
on
board
and
dragging
each
beneath
the
benches
bound
him
there
then
all
in
haste
i
urged
my
people
to
ascend
again
their
hollow
barks
lest
others
also
fed
with
fruit
of
lotus
should
forget
their
home
they
quick
embark
and
on
the
benches
ranged
in
order
thresh
with
oars
the
foamy
flood
thence
the

pushing
in

there
abide
till
rising
gales
should
tempt
him
forth
again
at
bottom
of
the
bay
runs
a
clear
stream
issuing
from
a
cove
hemm
all
around
with
poplars
down
into
that
bay
we
amid
the
darkness
of
the
night
some
god
conducting
us
for
all
unseen
it
lay
such
gloom
involved
the
fleet
nor
shone
the
moon
from
to

us
veil
by
pitchy
clouds
hence
none
the
isle
descried
nor
any
saw
the
lofty
surge
roll
on
the
strand
or
ere
our
vessels
struck
the
ground
but
when
they
struck
then
all
our
sails
we
disembark
and
on
the
slept
till
dawn
appear
soon
as
aurora
daughter
of
the
dawn
look
rosy
forth
we
with
admiring
eyes
the
isle
survey
roaming
it
wide
around
meantime
the
nymphs
jove
daughters
roused
the
goats
bred
on
the
mountains
to
supply
with
food
the
partners
of
my
toils
then
bringing
forth
bows
and
javelins
from
the
ships
divided
all
into
three
bands
we
struck
them
and
the
gods
gave
us
much
prey
twelve
ships
attended
me
and
ship
nine
goats
received
by
lot
myself
alone
selected
ten
all
day
till
set
of

we
eating
sat
goat
flesh
and
drinking
wine
delicious
without
stint
for
dearth
was
none
of
ruddy
wine
on
board
but
much
remain
with
which
my
people
had
their
jars
supplied
what
time
we
sack
ciconian
ismarus
thence
looking
forth
toward
the
where
dwell
the
cyclops
rising
smoke
we
saw
and
voices
heard
their
own
and
of
their
flocks
now
sank
the
sun
and
night
all
we
slept
along
the
shore
but
when
again
the
daughter
of
the
dawn
look
forth
my
crews
convened
i
thus
began
companions
of
my
course
here
rest
ye
all
save
my
own
crew
with
whom
i
will
explore
this
people
whether
wild
they
be
unjust
and
to
contention
or
to
strangers
and
a
race
who
fear
the
gods
so
speaking
i
embark
and
bade
embark
my
followers
throwing
quick
the
hawsers
loose
they
at
my
word
the
benches
and
thresh
with
oars
the
foamy
flood
attaining
soon
that
we
found
at
its
extremity
fast
by
the
sea
a
cavern
lofty
and
above
with
laurels
in
that
cavern
lay
much
cattle
sheep
and
goats
and
a
broad
court
enclosed
it
fenced
with
stones
from
quarries
hewn
with
spiry
firs
and
oaks
of
ample
bough
here
dwelt
a
giant
vast
who
far
remote
his
flocks
fed
solitary
converse
none
desiring
sullen
savage
and
unjust
monster
in
truth
he
was
hideous
in
form
resembling
less
a
man
by
ceres
gift
sustain
than
some
aspiring
tufted
with
wood
and
standing
all
alone
enjoining
then
my
people
to
abide
fast
by
the
ship
which
they
should
closely
guard
i
went
but
not
without
a
with
sable
wine
which
i
had
erst
received
from
maron
offspring
of
evanthes
priest
of
phœbus
guardian
god
of
ismarus
because
through
of
him
we
had
saved
himself
his
wife
and
children
for
he
dwelt
amid
the
grove
umbrageous
of
his
god
he
gave
me
therefore
noble
gifts
from
him
talents
i
received
of
beaten
gold
a
beaker
argent
all
and
after
these
no
fewer
than
twelve
jars
with
wine
replete
rich
drink
for
gods
nor
knew
one
servant
male
or
female
of
that
wine
in
all
his
house
none
knew
it
save
himself
his
wife
and
the
intendant
of
his
stores
oft
as
they
drank
that
luscious
juice
he
slaked
a
single
cup
with
twenty
from
the
stream
and
even
then
the
beaker
breath
abroad
a
scent
celestial
which
whoever
smelt
thenceforth
no
pleasure
found
it
to
abstain
charged
with
an
ample
of
this
wine
i
went
and
with
a
wallet
well
supplied
but
felt
a
sudden
presage
in
my
soul
that
haply
with
terrific
force
endued
some
savage
would
appear
strange
to
the
laws
and
privileges
of
the
human
race
few
steps
convey
us
to
his
den
but
him
we
found
not
he
his
flocks
pastur
abroad
his
cavern
we
with
wonder
gazed
around
on
all
his
strainers
hung
with
cheese
distended
wide
with
lambs
and
kids
his
penns
we
saw
and
folded
separate
the
various
charge
the
eldest
all
apart
apart
the
and
the
also
apart
his
pails
and
bowls
with
whey
swam
all
neat
vessels
into
which
he
milk
me
then
my
friends
first
importuned
to
take
a
portion
of
his
cheeses
then
to
drive
forth
from
the
to
the
rapid
bark
his
kids
and
lambs
and
plow
the
brine
again
but
me
they
moved
not
happier
had
they
moved
i
wish
to
see
him
and
to
gain
perchance
some
pledge
of
hospitality
at
his
hands
whose
form
was
such
as
should
not
much
bespeak
when
he
appear
our
confidence
or
love
then
kindling
fire
we
offer
to
the
gods
and
of
his
cheeses
eating
patient
sat
till
home
he
trudged
from
pasture
charged
he
came
with
dry
wood
bundled
an
enormous
load
fuel
by
which
to
sup
loud
crash
the
thorns
which
down
he
cast
before
the
cavern
mouth
to
whose
interior
nooks
we
trembling
flew
at
once
he
drove
into
his
spacious
cave
his
batten
flock
all
those
which
gave
him
milk
but
all
the
males
both
rams
and
goats
he
left
abroad
excluded
from
the
upheaving
next
a
rocky
barrier
huge
to
his
cave
mouth
he
thrust
it
home
that
weight
not
all
the
oxen
from
its
place
had
moved
of
twenty
and
two
wains
with
such
a
rock
immense
his
den
he
closed
then
down
he
sat
and
as
he
milk
his
ewes
and
bleating
goats
all
in
their
turns
her
yeanling
gave
to
each
coagulating
then
with
brisk
dispatch
the
half
of
his
new
milk
he
thrust
the
curd
into
his
wicker
sieves
but
stored
the
rest
in
pans
and
bowls
his
customary
drink
his
labours
thus
perform
he
kindled
last
his
fuel
and
discerning
enquired
who
are
ye
strangers
from
what
distant
shore
roam
ye
the
waters

to
no

wander
as

beside

with
terrour

the

his

uncouth
to
whom
though
sore
appall
i
thus
replied
of

we
and
bound
from
ilium
home
have
wander
wide
the
expanse
of
ocean
sport
for

and
driven
from
our
course
have
here
arrived
so
stood
the
will
of
jove
we
boast
ourselves
of
agamemnon

the
son
of

at
this
hour
the
chief
beyond
all
others
under
renown
so
great
a
city
he
hath
sack
and
slain
such
foes
but
since
we
reach
at
last
thy
knees
we
beg
such
hospitable
fare
or
other
gift
as
guests
are

either
thou

the

jove
or
all
the
of

is
mightier
far
nor
shall
myself
through
fear
of

hostility
abstain
from
thee
or
thine
unless
my
choice
be
such
but
tell
me
now
where
touch
thy
gallant
bark
our
country
on
thy
first
arrival
here
remote
or
nigh
for
i
would
learn
the
truth
so
spake
he
tempting
me
but
artful
thus
i
answer
penetrating
his
intent
my
vessel
neptune
shaker
of
the
shores
at
yonder
utmost
promontory
in
pieces
hurling
her
against
the
rocks
with
winds
that
blew
right
thither
from
the
sea
and
i
with
these
alone
escaped
alive
so
i
to
whom
relentless
answer
none
he
deign
but
with
his
arms
extended
sprang
toward
my
people
of
whom
seizing
two
at
once
like
whelps
against
his
he
dash
them
and
their
brains
spread
on
the
ground
these
hewn
for
supper
he
prepared
and
like
a
neither
flesh
nor
entrails
left
nor
yet
their
marrowy
bones
we
viewing
that
tremendous
sight
upraised
our
hands
to
jove
all
hope
and
courage
lost
when
thus
the
cyclops
had
with
human
flesh
fill
his
capacious
belly
and
had
much
undiluted
milk
among
his
flocks
immense
he
press
his
me
then
my
courage
prompted
to
approach
the
monster
with
my
sword
drawn
from
the
sheath
and
to
transfix
him
where
the
vitals
wrap
the
liver
but
maturer
thoughts
forbad
for
so
we
also
had
incurred
a
death
tremendous
wanting
to
thrust
aside
the
rocky
mass
that
closed
his
by
force
of
hand
alone
thus
many
a
sigh
heaving
we
watch
the
dawn
but
when
at
length

look
forth
then
kindling

order
and
her

thus
he
had
his
wonted
task
two
seizing
as
before
he
slew
them
for
his
next
obscene
regale
his
dinner
ended
from
the
cave
he
drove
his
fatted
flocks
abroad
moving
with
ease
that
barrier
and
replacing
it
as
he
had
only
closed
a
quiver
lid
then
hissing
them
along
he
drove
his
flocks
toward
the
mountain
and
me
left
the
while
deep
ruminating
how
i
best
might
take
vengeance
and
by
the
aid
of
pallas
win
deathless
renown
this
counsel
pleas
me
most
beside
the

massy
club
hewn
by
the
cyclops
from
an
olive
stock
green
but
which
dried
should
serve
him
for
a
staff
to
us

that
staff
tall
as

smooth
it
and
myself
shaping
its

extremity
to

it
in

then
close
the

hid
it
under

straw
for

now
i
bade
my

cast
the
lot
who
of
us
all
should
take
the
pointed

and
grind
it
in
his

when

he
slept
the
lots
were
cast
and
four
were
chosen
those
whom
most
i

and
i
was
chosen
fifth
at
he
came
his
fleecy
flocks
pasturing
homeward
and
compell
them
all
into
his
cavern
leaving
none
abroad
either
through
some
surmise
or
so
inclined
by
influence
haply
of
the

the
huge
rock

at

sitting

his

and
her

thrust
under
each
thus
all
his
work
dispatch
two
more
he
seiz
and
to
his
supper
fell
i
then
approaching
to
him
thus
the
cyclops
holding
in
my
hands
a
cup
of
with
ruddy
wine
lo
cyclops
this
is
wine
take
this
and
drink
after
thy
meal
of
man
flesh
taste
and
learn
what
precious
liquor
our
lost
vessel
bore
i
brought
it
hither
purposing
to
make
libation
to
thee
if
to
pity
inclined
thou
dismiss
us
home
but
ah
thy
rage
is
insupportable
thou
cruel
one
who
thinkest
thou
of
all
mankind
henceforth
will
visit
guilty
of
such
excess
i
ceas
he
took
and
drank
and
hugely
pleas
with
that
delicious
thus
enquir
give
me
again
and
spare
not
tell
me
too
thy
name
incontinent
that
i
may
make
requital
gratifying
also
thee
with
somewhat
to
thy
taste
we
cyclops
own
a
bounteous
soil
which
yields
also
wine
from
clusters
large
nourish
by
from
jove
but
this
this
is
from
above
a
stream
of
nectar
and
ambrosia
all
divine
he
ended
and
received
a
second
draught
like
measure
thrice
i
bore
it
to
his
hand
and
foolish
thrice
he
drank
but
when
the
fumes
began
to
play
around
the
cyclops
brain
with
show
of
amity
i
thus
replied
cyclops
thou
hast
my
noble
name
enquired
which
i
will
tell
thee
give
me
in
return
the
promised
boon
some
hospitable
pledge
my
name
is
outis
outis
i
am
at
home
abroad
wherever
i
am
known
so
i
to
whom
he
savage
thus
replied
outis
when
i
have
eaten
all
his
friends
shall
be
my
last
regale
be
that
thy
boon
he
spake
and
downward
sway
fell
resupine
with
his
huge
neck
aslant
sleep
soon
seized
him
from
his
gullet
gush
the
wine
with
human
morsels
mingled
many
a
blast
sonorous
issuing
from
his
glutted
maw
then
thrusting
far
the
spike
of
into
the
embers
glowing
on
the
hearth
i
heated
it
and
cheer
my
friends
the
while
lest
any
should
through
fear
shrink
from
his
part
but
when
that
stake
of
though
green
should
soon
have
flamed
for
it
was
glowing
hot
i
bore
it
to
his
side
then
all
my
aids
around
me
gather
and
the
gods
infused
heroic
fortitude
into
our
hearts
they
seizing
the
hot
stake
rasp
to
a
point
bored
his
eye
with
it
and
myself
advanced
to
a
superior
stand
twirled
it
about
as
when
a
shipwright
with
his
wimble
bores
tough
oaken
timber
placed
on
either
side
below
his
strain
the
thong
alternate
and
the
restless
iron
spins
so
grasping
hard
the
stake
pointed
with
fire
we
twirl
it
in
his
eye
the
bubbling
blood
boil
round
about
the
brand
his
pupil
sent
a
scalding
vapour
forth
that
sing
his
brow
and
all
his
crackled
in
the
flame
as
when
the
smith
an
hatchet
or
large
axe
with
skill
plunges
the
hissing
blade
deep
in
cold
water
whence
the
strength
of
steel
so
hiss
his
eye
around
the
the
howling
monster
with
his
outcry
the
hollow
rock
and
i
with
all
my
aids
fled
terrified
he
plucking
forth
the
spike
from
his
burnt
socket
mad
with
anguish
cast
the
implement
all
bloody
far
away
then
bellowing
he
sounded
forth
the
name
of
cyclops
dwelling
in
the
caves
around
him
on
the
they
at
his
cry
flocking
from
part
circled
his
den
and
of
his
ail
enquired
what
grievous
hurt
hath
caused
thee
polypheme
thus
yelling
to
alarm
the
peaceful
ear
of
night
and
break
our
slumbers
thou
lest
some
mortal
man
drive
off
thy
flocks
or
thyself
to
die
by
cunning
or
by
force
them
answer
then
polypheme
from
his
cave
oh
friends
i
die
and
outis
gives
the
blow
to
whom
with
accents
wing
his
friends
without
if
no
man
harm
thee
but
thou
art
alone
and
sickness
it
is
the
stroke
of
jove
and
thou
must
bear
it
yet
invoke
for
aid
thy
father
neptune
sovereign
of
the
floods
so
saying
they
went
and
in
my
heart
i
that
by
the
fiction
only
of
a
name
slight
stratagem
i
had
deceived
them
all
then
groan
the
cyclops
wrung
with
pain
and
grief
and
fumbling
with
stretch
hands
removed
the
rock
from
his
cave
mouth
which
done
he
sat
him
down
spreading
his
arms
athwart
the
pass
to
stop
our
egress
with
his
flocks
abroad
so
dull
it
seems
he
held
me
and
so
i
pondering
what
means
might
fittest
prove
to
save
from
instant
death
if
save
i
might
my
people
and
myself
to
shift
inclined
and
various
counsels
framed
as
one
who
strove
for
life
conscious
of
woe
at
hand
to
me
thus
meditating
this
the
likeliest
course
the
rams
were
with
wool
of
sable
hue
these
silently
with
osier
twigs
on
which
the
cyclops
hideous
monster
slept
i
bound
three
in
one
leash
the
intermediate
rams
bore
each
a
man
whom
the
exterior
two
preserved
concealing
him
on
either
side
thus
each
was
borne
by
three
and
i
at
last
the
curl
back
seizing
of
a
ram
for
one
i
had
reserv
far
stateliest
of
them
all
slipp
underneath
his
belly
and
both
hands
enfolding
fast
in
his
fleece
clung
ceaseless
to
him
as
i
lay
supine
we
thus
disposed
waited
with
many
a
sigh
the
sacred
dawn
but
when
at
length
aurora
daughter
again
appear
the
males
of
all
his
flocks
rush
forth
to
pasture
and
meantime
unmilk
the
wethers
bleated
by
the
load
of
udders
overcharged
their
master
with
pain
intolerable
handled
yet
the
backs
of
all
inquisitive
as
they
stood
but
gross
of
intellect
suspicion
none
conceiv
of
men
beneath
their
bodies
bound
and
now
none
left
beside
the
ram
with
his
own
wool
burthen
and
with
myself
whom
many
a
fear
molested
polypheme
the
giant
stroak
him
as
he
sat
and
said
my
darling
ram
why
latest
of
the
flock
thou
whom
never
heretofore
my
sheep
could
leave
behind
but
stalking
at
their
head
thou
first
was
wont
to
crop
the
tender
grass
first
to
arrive
at
the
clear
stream
and
first
with
ready
will
to
seek
my
here
at
evening
but
thy
practice
chang
thou
now
last
of
all
thou
regret
my
ram
of
thy
poor
master
eye
by
a
vile
wretch
bored
out
who
overcame
me
first
with
wine
and
by
a
crew
of
vagabonds
accurs
followers
of
outis
whose
escape
from
death
shall
not
be
made
ah
that
thy
heart
were
as
my
own
and
that
distinct
as
i
thou
articulate
so
thou
tell
where
hidden
he
eludes
my
furious
wrath
then
dash
against
the
floor
his
spatter
brain
should
fly
and
i
should
lighter
feel
my
harm
from
outis
wretch
and
so
saying
he
left
him
to
pursue
the
flock
when
thus
drawn
forth
we
had
at
length
escaped
few
paces
from
the
cavern
and
the
court
first
quitting
my
own
ram
i
loos
my
friends
then
turning
seaward
many
a
thriven
ewe
we
drove
them
swiftly
to
the
ship
thrice
welcome
to
our
faithful
friends
we
came
from
death
escaped
but
much
they
mourn
the
dead
i
suffer
not
their
tears
but
silent
shook
my
brows
by
signs
commanding
them
to
lift
the
sheep
on
board
and
instant
plow
the
main
they
quick
embarking
on
the
benches
sat
well
ranged
and
thresh
with
oars
the
foamy
flood
but
distant
now
such
length
as
a
loud
voice
may
reach
i
hail
with
taunts
the
cyclops
ear
cyclops
when
thou
devouredst
in
thy
cave
with
brutal
force
my
followers
thou
the
followers
of
no
timid
chief
or
base
vengeance
was
sure
to
recompense
that
deed
atrocious
monster
who
wast
not
afraid
to
eat
the
guest
shelter
beneath
thy
roof
therefore
the
gods
have
well
requited
thee
i
ended
he
raged
the
more
and
rending
from
its
hold
a
hurl
it
toward
us
at
our
vessel
stern
down
came
the
mass
nigh
sweeping
in
its
fall

the
ocean
at
the
plunge
of
that
huge
rock
high
on
its
refluent
flood
heav
irresistible
the
ship
to
land
i
seizing
quick
our
longest
pole
on
board
back
thrust
her
from
the
coast
and
by
a
nod
in
silence
given
bade
my
companions
ply
strenuous
their
oars
that
so
we
might
escape
procumbent
each
obey
and
when
the
flood
cleaving
we
twice
that
distance
had
obtain
again
i
hail
the
cyclops
but
my
friends
earnest
dissuaded
me
on
side
ah
rash
ulysses
why
with
taunts
provoke
the
savage
more
who
hath
this
moment
a
weapon
such
as
heav
the
ship
again
to
land
where
death
seem
certain
to
us
all
for
had
he
heard
a
cry
or
but
the
voice
of
one
man
speaking
he
had
all
our
heads
with
some
sharp
rock
and
all
our
timbers
crush
together
such
vast
force
is
in
his
arm
so
they
but
my
courageous
heart
unmoved
and
thus
again
incensed
i
spake
cyclops
should
any
mortal
man
inquire
to
whom
thy
shameful
loss
of
sight
thou
say
to
ulysses
chief
laertes
son
native
of
ithaca
i
ceas
and
with
a
groan
thus
he
replied
ah
me
an
antient
oracle
i
feel
accomplish
here
abode
a
prophet

a
man
of

and

prophesying
to
the
grew

among

and
presaged
my
loss
of

in

i
therefore
watch
for
the
arrival
here
always
of
some
great
chief
for
stature
bulk
and
beauty
prais
and
cloath
with
might
but
now
a
dwarf
a

impalpable
a

overcame
me
first
by
wine
then
quench
my

come
hither
o
my

ulysses
hospitable
cheer
awaits
thee
and
my

will
prefer
to

for
thy

for
i
am

and
the

is
proud
to
be
my

he
if
he
please
and
he
alone
can
heal
me
none
beside
of

thus
return
i

amerced
i
could
as
sure
dismiss
thee
down
to
hell
as
none

not

so
i
then
pray
the
cyclops
to

but
if

him

for

to

and
let
affliction
meet
him
at
his
door

spake
and
ocean
heard
his
then
lifting
from
the
shore
a
stone
of

far
more
enormous

the

and
his
immeasurable
force
exerting
all

it
close
behind

down

the

the

at
the
plunge
of
such
a
weight
high
on
its
refluent
flood
tumultuous
heaved
the
bark
well
nigh
to

but
when
we
reach
the
isle
where
we
had
left
our
barks
and
where
my
people
sat
watching
with
ceaseless
sorrow
our
return
we
thrust
our
vessel
to
the
sandy
shore
then
disembark
and
of
the
cyclops
sheep
gave
equal
share
to
all
to
me
alone
my
the
ram
in
distribution
my
peculiar
meed
him
therefore
to
saturnian
jove
i
offer
on
the
shore
burning
his
thighs
in
sacrifice
but
jove
my
hallow
rites
reck
not
destruction
purposing
to
all
my
barks
and
all
my
followers
the
deep
thus
feasting
largely
on
the
shore
we
sat
till
and
quaffing
wine
but
when
day
fail
and
night
all
then
on
the
shore
we
slept
and
when
again

rosy
daughter
of
the

look
forth
my
people
anxious
i
to
climb
their
barks
and
cast
the
hawsers
loose
they
all
obedient
took
their
seats
on
board
and
thresh
with
oars
the
foamy
flood
thus
narrowly
we
roam
the
deep
with
aching
hearts
and
with
diminish
crews
footnotes
so
the
scholium
interprets
in
this
place
the
word
ὑπερθιαλος
λινως
clarke
who
has
preserved
this
name
in
his
marginal
version
contends
strenuously
and
with
great
reason
that
outis
ought
not
to
be
translated
and
in
a
passage
which
he
quotes
from
the
we
see
much
fault
found
with
giphanius
and
other
interpreters
of
homer
for
having
translated
it
it
is
certain
that
in
homer
the
word
is
declined
not
as
which
signifies
no
man
but
as
making
ουτιν
in
the
accusative
consequently
as
a
proper
name
it
is
sufficient
that
the
ambiguity
was
such
as
to
deceive
the
friends
of
the
cyclops
outis
is
said
by
some
perhaps
absurdly
to
have
been
a
name
given
to
ulysses
on
account
of
his
having
larger
ears
than
common
outis
as
a
could
only
denote
him
who
bore
it
but
as
a
it
signifies
which
accounts
sufficiently
for
the
ludicrous
mistake
of
his
brethren
προπεσοντες
olli
certamine
summo
procumbunt
virgil
the
seeming
incongruity
of
this
line
with
line
is
reconciled
by
supposing
that
ulysses
exerted
his
voice
naturally
loud
in
an
extraordinary
manner
on
this
second
occasion
see
clarke
book
x

ulysses

of
his
narrative

his
arrival
at
the
island
of
æolus
his
departure
thence
and
the
unhappy
occasion
of
his
return
thither
the
monarch
of
the
winds
dismisses
him
at
last
with
much
asperity
he
next
tells
of
his
arrival
among
the
læstrygonians
by

his

fleet
together
with
their
crews

hath
officed
arbiter
of
all
the
winds
to
rouse
their
force
or
calm
them
at
his
will
he
gave
me
them
on
board
my
bark
so
bound
with
silver
twine
that
not
a
breath
escaped
then
order
gentle
zephyrus
to
fill
our
sails
propitious
order
vain
alas
so
fatal
proved
the
folly
of
my
friends
nine
days
continual
night
and
day
we
sail
and
on
the
tenth
my
native
land
appear
not
far
remote
my
ithacans
i
saw
fires
kindling
on
the
coast
but
me
with
toil
worn
and
with
watching
gentle
sleep
subdued
for
constant
i
had
ruled
the
helm
nor
that
charge
to
any
fearful
of
delay
then
in
close
conference
combined
my
crew
each
other
thus
bespake
he
carries
home
silver
and
gold
from
æolus
received
offspring
of
hippotas
illustrious
chief
and
thus
a
mariner
the
rest
harangued
ye
gods
what
city
or
what
land
ulysses
visits
how
is
he
by
all
and
honour
many
precious
spoils
he
homeward
bears
from
troy
but
we
return
we
who
the
voyage
have
perform
with
empty
hands
now
also
he
hath
this
pledge
of
friendship
from
the
king
of
winds
but
come
be
quick
search
we
the
bag
and
learn
what
stores
of
gold
and
silver
it
contains
so
he
whose
mischievous
advice
prevailed
they
loos
the
bag
forth
issued
all
the
winds
and
caught
by
tempests
the
billowy
waste
weeping
they
flew
far
far
from
ithaca
i
then
awaking
in
my
noble
mind
stood
doubtful
whether
from
my
vessel
side
immersed
to
perish
in
the
flood
or
calm
to
endure
my
sorrows
and
content
to
live
i
calm
endured
them
but
around
my
head
winding
my
mantle
lay
me
down
below
while
adverse
blasts
bore
all
my
fleet
again
to
the
æolian
isle
then
groan
my
people
we
disembark
and
drew
fresh
water
there
and
my
companions
at
their
galley
sides
all
seated
took
repast
short
meal
we
made
when
with
an
herald
and
a
chosen
friend
i
sought
once
more
the
hall
of
æolus
him
banqueting
with
all
his
sons
we
found
and
with
his
spouse
we
on
the
floor
of
his
wide
portal
sat
whom
they
amazed
beheld
and
of
our
coming
thus
enquired
return
ulysses
by
what
adverse
repuls
hast
thou
arrived
we
sent
thee
hence
forth
to
reach
thy
native
isle
thy
palace
or
what
place
thou
so
they
to
whom
i
replied
my
worthless
crew
have
wrong
me
nor
alone
my
worthless
crew
but
sleep
as
much
yet
heal
o
friends
my
hurt
the
is
yours
so
i
their
favour
woo
mute
sat
the
sons
but
thus
their
father
answer
hence
be
gone
leave
this
our
isle
thou
most
obnoxious
wretch
of
all
mankind
i
should
myself
transgress
receiving
here
and
giving
conduct
hence
to
one
detested
by
the
gods
as
thou
away
for
hated
by
the
gods
thou
so
saying
he
sent
me
from
his
palace
forth
groaning
profound
thence
therefore
the
deep
we
still
proceeded
sorrowful
our
force
exhausting
ceaseless
at
the
toilsome
oar
and
through
our
own
imprudence
hopeless
now
of
other
to
our
native
isle
six
days
we
navigated
day
and
night
the
briny
flood
and
on
the
seventh
the
city
erst
by
lamus
built
sublime
proud
læstrygonia
with
the
distant
gates
the
herdsman
there
driving
his
cattle
home
summons
the
shepherd
with
his
flocks
abroad

might
double
wages
earn
attending

now
tending

for

the
pastures
grazed
by
day
close
border
both
the
to
that
illustrious
port
we
came
by
rocks
uninterrupted
flank
on
either
side
of
height
while
prominent
the
shores
and
bold
converging
at
the
haven
mouth
leave
narrow
pass
we
push
our
galleys
in
then
moor
them
side
by
side
for
never
surge
there
lifts
its
head
or
great
or
small
but
clear
we
found
and
motionless
the
shelter
flood
myself
alone
staying
my
bark
without
secured
her
well
with
hawsers
to
a
rock
at
the
land
point
then
climb
the
rugged
steep
and
spying
stood
the
country
labours
none
of
men
or
oxen
in
the
land
appear
nor
aught
beside
saw
we
but
from
the
earth
smoke
rising
therefore
of
my
friends
i
sent
before
me
two
adding
an
herald
third
to
learn
what
race
of
men
that
country
fed
departing
they
an
even
track
pursued
made
by
the
waggons
bringing
timber
down
from
the
high
mountains
to
the
town
below
before
the
town
a
virgin
bearing
forth
her
they
met
daughter
of
him
who
ruled
the
læstrygonian
race
antiphatas
descending
from
the
gate
she
sought
the
fount
artacia
for
their
custom
was
to
draw
from
that
pure
fountain
for
the
city
use
approaching
they
accosted
her
and
what
king
reign
there
and
over
whom
he
reign
she
gave
them
soon
to
know
where
stood
sublime
the
palace
of
her
sire
no
sooner
they
the
palace
enter
than
within
they
found
in
size
resembling
an
huge
a
woman
whom
they
shudder
to
behold
she
forth
from
council
summon
quick
her
spouse
antiphatas
who
teeming
came
with
thoughts
of
carnage
and
arriving
seized
at
once
a
greecian
whom
next
moment
he
devoured
with
headlong
terrour
the
surviving
two
fled
to
the
ships
then
sent
antiphatas
his
voice
through
all
the
town
and
on
all
sides
hearing
that
cry
the
læstrygonians
numberless
and
in
size
resembling
more
the
giants
than
mankind
they
from
the
rocks
cast
down
into
our
fleet
enormous
stones
a
strong
man
burthen
each
dire
din
arose
of
shatter
galleys
and
of
dying
men
whom
spear
like
fishes
to
their
home
they
bore
a
loathsome
prey
while
them
within
the
port
they
slaughter
i
the
faulchion
at
my
side
drawn
forth
cut
loose
the
hawser
of
my
ship
and
all
my
crew
enjoin
with
bosoms
laid
prone
on
their
oars
to
fly
the
threaten
woe
they
dreading
instant
death
tugg
resupine
together
and
the
galley
from
beneath
those
beetling
rocks
into
the
open
sea
shot
gladly
but
the
rest
all
perish
there
proceeding
thence
we
sigh
and
roamed
the
waves
glad
that
we
lived
but
sorrowing
for
the
slain
we
came
to
the
ææan
isle
there
dwelt
the
awful
circe
goddess
in
magic
song
sister
by
birth
of
the
æætes
them
the
sun
bright
luminary
of
the
world
begat
on
perse
daughter
of
oceanus
our
vessel
there
noiseless
we
push
to
land
within
a
spacious
haven
thither
led
by
some
celestial
we
disembark
and
on
the
coast
two
days
and
nights
entire
extended
lay
worn
with
long
toil
and
each
the
victim
of
his
woes
then
with
my
spear
and
with
my
faulchion
arm
i
left
the
ship
to
climb
with
hasty
steps
an
airy
height
thence
hoping
to
espie
some
works
of
man
or
hear
perchance
a
voice
exalted
on
a
rough
rock
craggy
point
i
stood
and
on
the
distant
plain
beheld
smoke
which
from
circe
palace
through
the
gloom
of
trees
and
thickets
rose
that
smoke
discern
i
ponder
next
if
thither
i
should
haste
seeking
intelligence
long
time
i
mused
but
chose
at
last
as
my
discreter
course
to
seek
the
and
my
bark
again
and
when
my
crew
had
eaten
to
dispatch
before
me
others
who
should
first
enquire
but
ere
i
yet
had
reach
my
gallant
bark
some
god
with
pity
viewing
me
alone
in
that
untrodden
solitude
sent
forth
an
antler
stag
into
my
path
his
woodland
pastures
left
he
sought
the
stream
for
he
was
thirsty
and
already
by
the
sun
heat
him
issuing
from
his
haunt
sheer
through
the
back
beneath
his
middle
spine
i
wounded
and
the
lance
sprang
forth
beyond
moaning
he
fell
and
in
the
dust
expired
then
treading
on
his
breathless
trunk
i
my
weapon
forth
which
leaving
there
reclined
i
tore
away
the
osiers
with
my
hands
and
fallows
green
and
to
a
fathom
length
twisting
the
gather
twigs
into
a
band
bound
fast
the
feet
of
my
enormous
prey
and
flinging
him
athwart
my
neck
toward
my
sable
bark
propp
on
my
lance
which
now
to
carry
shoulder
as
before
surpass
my
so
bulky
was
the
load
arriving
at
the
ship
there
i
let
fall
my
burthen
and
with
pleasant
speech
and
kind
man
after
man
addressing
cheer
my
crew
my
friends
we
suffer
much
but
shall
not
seek
the
shades
ere
yet
our
destined
hour
arrive
behold
a
feast
and
we
have
wine
on
board
pine
not
with
needless
famine
rise
and
eat
i
spake
they
readily
obey
and
each
issuing
at
my
word
abroad
beside
the
galley
stood
admiring
as
he
lay
the
stag
for
of
no
common
bulk
was
he
at
length
their
eyes
gratified
to
the
full
with
that
glad
spectacle
they
laved
their
hands
and
preparation
made
of
noble
cheer
that
day
complete
till
set
of
sun
we
spent
feasting
deliciously
without
restraint
and
quaffing
generous
wine
but
when
the
sun
went
down
and
darkness
overshadow
all
extended
then
on
ocean
bank
we
lay
and
when
aurora
daughter
of
the
dawn
look
rosy
forth
convening
all
my
crew
to
council
i
arose
and
thus
began
my
however
worn
with
hardships
hear
for
neither
west
know
ye
nor
east
where
rises
or
where
sets
the
sun
but
let
us
think
if
thought
perchance
may
profit
us
of
which
small
hope
i
see
for
when
i
lately
yon
craggy
rock
plainly
i
could
discern
the
land
encompass
by
the
boundless
deep
the
isle
is
flat
and
in
the
midst
i
saw
dun
smoke
ascending
from
an
oaken
so
i
whom
hearing
they
all
courage
lost
and
at
remembrance
of
antiphatas
the
læstrygonian
and
the
cyclops
deeds
ferocious
feeder
on
the
flesh
of
man
mourn
loud
and
wept
but
tears
could
nought
avail
then
man
by
man
i
parted
them
in
equal
portions
and
assign
a
chief
to
either
band
myself
to
these
to
those
godlike
eurylochus
this
done
we
cast
the
lots
into
the
helmet
and
at
once
forth
sprang
the
lot
of
bold
eurylochus
he
went
and
with
him
of
my
people
twenty
and
two
all
weeping
nor
ourselves
wept
less
at
separation
from
our
friends
low
in
a
vale
but
on
an
open
spot
they
found
the
splendid
house
of
circe
built
with
hewn
and
polish
stones
compass
she
dwelt
by
lions
on
all
sides
and
tamed
by
herself
with
drugs
of
noxious
nor
were
they
mischievous
but
as
my
friends
approach
arising
on
their
hinder
feet
paw
them
in
blandishment
and
wagg
the
tail
as
when
from
feast
he
rises
dogs
around
their
master
fawn
accustom
to
receive
the
sop
conciliatory
from
his
hand
around
my
people
so
those
talon
wolves
and
lions
fawn
they
terrified
that
troop
of
savage
monsters
horrible
beheld
and
now
before
the
goddess
gates
arrived
they
heard
the
voice
of
circe
singing
sweet
within
while
busied
at
the
loom
she
wove
an
ample
web
immortal
such
a
work
transparent
graceful
and
of
bright
design
as
hands
of
goddesses
alone
produce
thus
then
polites
prince
of
men
the
friend
highest
in
my
esteem
the
rest
bespake
ye
hear
the
voice
comrades
of
one
who
weaves
an
ample
web
within
and
at
her
task
so
sweetly
chaunts
that
all
the
marble
floor
human
be
she
or
divine
i
doubt
but
let
us
call
that
we
may
learn
he
ceas
they
call
soon
issuing
at
the
sound
the
goddess
open
wide
her
splendid
gates
and
bade
them
in
they
heedless
all
complied
all
save
eurylochus
who
fear
a
snare
she
introducing
them
conducted
each
to
a
bright
throne
then
gave
them
pramnian
wine
with
grated
cheese
pure
meal
and
honey
new
but
medicated
with
her
drugs
their
food
that
in
oblivion
they
might
lose
the
wish
of
home
she
gave
them
and
they
drank
when
smiting
each
with
her
enchanting
wand
she
shut
them
in
her
sties
in
head
in
voice
in
body
and
in
bristles
they
became
all
swine
yet
intellected
as
before
and
at
her
hand
were
dieted
alone
with
acorns
chestnuts
and
the
food
grateful
ever
to
the
grovelling
swine
back
flew
eurylochus
toward
the
ship
to
tell
the
woeful
tale
struggling
to
speak
yet
speechless
there
he
stood
his
heart
transfixt
with
anguish
and
his
eyes
deluged
with
tears
me
boding
terrours
occupied
at
length
when
gazing
on
him
all
had
oft
enquired
he
thus
rehearsed
to
us
the
dreadful
change
renown
ulysses
as
thou
we
went
through
yonder
oaks
there
bosom
in
a
vale
but
built
conspicuous
on
a
swelling
knoll
with
polish
rock
we
found
a
stately
dome
within
some
goddess
or
some
woman
wove
an
ample
web
carolling
sweet
the
while
they
call
aloud
she
issuing
at
the
voice
unfolded
soon
her
splendid
portals
wide
and
bade
them
in
heedless
they
enter
all
but
i
remain
suspicious
of
a
snare
ere
long
the
whole
band
vanish
none
i
saw
thenceforth
though
seated
there
long
time
i
watch
he
ended
i
my
studded
faulchion
huge
athwart
my
shoulder
cast
and
seized
my
bow
then
bade
him
lead
me
thither
by
the
way
himself
had
gone
but
with
both
hands
my
knees
he
clasp
and
in
wing
accents
sad
exclaim
my
king
ah
lead
me
not
unwilling
back
but
leave
me
here
for
confident
i
judge
that
neither
thou
wilt
bring
another
thence
nor
come
thyself
again
haste
fly
we
swift
with
these
for
we
at
least
may
yet
escape
so
he
to
whom
this
answer
i
return
eurylochus
abiding
here
eat
thou
and
drink
thy
fill
beside
the
sable
bark
i
go
necessity
forbids
my
stay
so
saying
i
left
the
galley
and
the
shore
but
ere
that
awful
vale
i
the
palace
of
the
sorceress
a
god
met
me
the
bearer
of
the
golden
wand
hermes
he
seem
a
stripling
in
his
prime
his
cheeks
cloath
only
with
their
earliest
down
for
youth
is
then
most
graceful
fast
he
lock
his
hand
in
mine
and
thus
familiar
spake
unhappy
whither
the
hills
stranger
to
all
this
region
and
alone
thou
thy
people
they
within
the
walls
are
shut
of
circe
where
as
swine
she
keeps
them
comest
thou
to
set
them
free
i
tell
thee
never
wilt
thou
thence
return
thyself
but
wilt
be
prison
with
the
rest
yet
hearken
i
will
disappoint
her
wiles
and
will
preserve
thee
take
this
precious
drug
possessing
this
enter
the
goddess
house
boldly
for
it
shall
save
thy
life
from
harm
lo
i
reveal
to
thee
the
cruel
arts
of
circe
learn
them
she
will
mix
for
thee
a
potion
and
will
also
drug
thy
food
with
noxious
herbs
but
she
shall
not
prevail
by
all
her
to
change
thee
for
the
force
superior
of
this
noble
plant
my
gift
shall
baffle
her
hear
still
what
i
advise
when
she
shall
smite
thee
with
her
slender
rod
with
faulchion
drawn
and
with
looks
rush
on
her
she
will
bid
thee
to
her
bed
affrighted
then
beware
decline
not
thou
her
love
that
she
may
both
release
thy
friends
and
may
with
kindness
entertain
thyself
but
force
her
swear
the
dreaded
oath
of
that
she
will
other
mischief
none
devise
against
thee
lest
she
strip
thee
of
thy
might
and
quenching
all
thy
virtue
make
thee
vile
so
spake
the
argicide
and
from
the
earth
that
plant
extracting
placed
it
in
my
hand
then
taught
me
all
its
black
was
the
root
the
blossom
moly
is
its
name
in
not
easily
by
mortal
man
dug
forth
but
all
is
easy
to
the
gods
then
hermes
through
the
to
and
i
to
circe
dread
abode
in
gloomy
musings
busied
as
i
went
within
the
vestibule
arrived
where
dwelt
the
beauteous
goddess
staying
there
my
steps
i
call
aloud
she
heard
me
and
at
once
issuing
threw
her
splendid
portals
wide
and
bade
me
in
i
follow
leading
me
by
the
hand
to
a
bright
throne
with
argent
studs
embellish
and
beneath
footstool
magnificent
she
made
me
sit
then
mingling
for
me
in
a
golden
cup
my
she
infused
a
drug
intent

next
with
purple

rich
she
spread
another
placed
before

bright

and
set
on
baskets
of
gold

an
argent

delicious
which
in
golden

she
served
the

brought
water
which
she
warm
within
an
ample
vase
and
when
the
flood
sang
in

led
me
to
a
bath
and
laved
me
with
the
pleasant
stream

neck
and

till
my
limbs
refresh
all

when
she
had
bathed
me
and
with
limpid
oil
anointed
me
and
cloathed
me
in
a

and
mantle
next
she
led
me
to
a
throne
of
royal
state
with
silver
studs

and

soft
beneath
then
came
a
nymph
with
golden
ewer
charged

who
pour
pure

and
placed
the

courteous
bade
me

but
me
it
pleas
not

soon
then
as

so
i
then
circe
bearing
in

her
potent
rod
went
forth
and
wide
the
door
drove
out
my
people
from
the
sty
in
bulk
resembling
brawns
of
the
ninth
year
they
stood
before
me
she
through
all
the
herd
proceeding
with
an
unctuous
antidote
anointed

and
at
the
wholesome
touch
all
shed
the

dread
circe

produced
restored
at

to

they
more
far
and
sightlier
than
before
they
knew
me
and
with
grasp
affectionate
hung
on
my
hand
tears
follow
but
of
joy
and
with
loud
cries
the
vaulted
palace
rang
even
the
awful
goddess
felt
herself
compassion
and
approaching
me
began
laertes
noble
son
for
wiles
renown
hence
to
the
shore
and
to
thy
gallant
bark
first
hale
her
safe
aground
then
hiding
all
your
arms
and
treasures
in
the
caverns
come
thyself
again
and
hither
lead
thy
friends
so
spake
the
goddess
and
my
mind
persuaded
thence
repairing
to
the
beach
i
sought
my
ship
arrived
i
found
my
crew
lamenting
miserably
and
their
cheeks
with
tears
bedewing
ceaseless
at
her
side
as
when
the
calves
within
some
village
behold
at
eve
the
herd
returning
home
from
fruitful
meads
where
they
have
grazed
their
fill
no
longer
in
the
stalls
contain
they
rush
with
many
a
frisk
abroad
and
blaring
oft
with
one
consent
all
dance
their
dams
around
so
they
at
sight
of
me
dissolved
in
tears
of
joy
and
each
his
spirit
felt
with
like
affections
warm
as
he
had
just
then
his
country
and
his
city
seen
fair
ithaca
where
he
was
born
and
rear
then
in

accents
tender
thus
they
spake
noble
ulysses
thy
appearance
fills
our
soul
with
transports
such
as
we
should
feel
arrived
in
safety
on
our
native
shore
speak
say
how
perish
our
unhappy
friends
so
they
to
whom
this
answer
mild
i
gave
hale
we
our
vessel
first
ashore
and
hide
in
caverns
all
our
treasures
and
our
arms
then
hasting
hence
follow
me
and
ere
long
ye
shall
behold
your
friends
beneath
the
roof
of
circe
banqueting
and
drinking
wine
abundant
for
no
dearth
attends
them
there
so
i
whom
all
with
readiness
obey
all
save
eurylochus
he
sought
alone
to
stay
the
rest
and
eager
interposed
ah
whither
tend
we
miserable
men
why
covet
ye
this
evil
to
go
down
to
circe
palace
she
will
change
us
all
to
lions
wolves
or
swine
that
we
may
guard
her
palace
by
necessity
constrain
so
some
were
of
the
cyclops
erst
when
led
by
rash
ulysses
our
lost
friends
intruded
needlessly
into
his
cave
and
perish
by
the
folly
of
their
chief
he
spake
whom
hearing
occupied
i
stood
in
whether

although
he
were
my
kinsman
in
the
bonds
of
close
affinity
but
all
my
friends
as
with
one
voice
thus
gently
interposed
noble
ulysses
we
will
leave
him
here
our
vessel
guard
if
such
be
thy
command
but
us
lead
thou
to
circe
dread
abode
so
saying
they
left
the
galley
and
set
forth
climbing
the
coast
nor
would
eurylochus
beside
the
hollow
bark
remain
but
his
comrades
by
my
dreadful
menace
awed
meantime
the
goddess
busily
employ
bathed
and
refresh
my
friends
with
limpid
oil
and
clothed
them
we
arriving
found
them
all
banqueting
in
the

there
they
met
these

and
those
rehearsed

and
the
recital
made
all
wept
aloud
till
the

dome
resounded
then
approach
the

goddess
and
address
me
thus
laertes
noble

now
to

i
am
not
ignorant
myself
how
dread

been
your
woes
both
on
the
fishy
deep
and
on
the

by
force
of
hostile
but
come
eat
now
and
drink
ye

that
so
your
freshen
spirit
may
revive
and
ye

as
when

of
all
your

such
have
been
your

she
spake

and
won
us
to
her
will
there
then
we
dwelt
the
year
complete
fed
with
delicious

and
quaffing

but
when

the
nations
of
the

piercing
the

next
i
turn
them
both
to
bleed
into
the

then
swarming
came
from

the
shades
of
the
deceased
brides
youths
unwedded
seniors
long
with
woe
oppress
and
tender
girls
yet
new

came
also
many
a
warrior
by
the
spear
in

pierced
with
armour
and
all
the
multitude
around
the

shrieking
dreadful
me
pale
horror
seized
i
next
importunate
my
people
urged
flaying
the
victims
which
myself
had
slain
to
burn
them
and
to
supplicate
in
illustrious
pluto
and
dread
proserpine
then
down
i
sat
and
with
drawn
faulchion
chased
the
ghosts
nor
suffer
them
to
approach
the
blood
till
with
tiresias
i
should
first
confer
the
spirit
first
of
my
companion
came
elpenor
for
no
burial
honours
yet
had
he
received
but
we
had
left
his
corse
in
circe
palace
tombless
undeplored

by
pressure
urged
of
other
cares

with
compassion
seeing
him
i
wept
and
in

accents
brief
him
thus
bespake
elpenor
how
thou
into
the
realms
of
darkness
hast
thou
though
on

so
far
outstripp
my
speed
who
in

arrived

i
to
whom
with
tears
he
thus
replied
laertes
noble
son
for
wiles
renown
fool
by
some
dæmon
and
the
bowl
i
perish
in
the
house
of
circe
there
the
steps
heedless
i
miss
and
fell
precipitated
from
the
roof
with
broken
from
the
vertebræ
outstretch
i
lay
my
spirit
sought
the
shades
but
now
by
those
whom
thou
hast
left
at
home
by
thy
penelope
and
by
thy
fire
the
gentle
nourisher
of
thy
infant
growth
and
by
thy
only
son
telemachus
i
make
my
suit
to
thee
for
sure
i
know
that
from
the
house
of
pluto
safe
return
thou
shalt
ere
long
thy
gallant

moor
at
the
ææan

ah
there
arrived
remember
me
leave
me
not
undeplored
nor
uninhumed
lest
for
my
sake
the
gods
in
vengeance
visit
thee
but
with
my
arms
what
arms
i
left
burn
me
and
raise
a
kind
memorial
of
me
on
the
coast
heap
high
with
earth
that
an
unhappy
man
may
yet
enjoy
an
unforgotten
name
thus
do
at
my
request
and
on
my
hill
funereal
plant
the
oar
with
which
i
row
while

i
lived
a
mariner
of
thine
he
spake
to
whom
thus
answer
i
return
poor
youth
i
will
perform
thy
whole
desire
thus
we
there
sitting
doleful
converse
held
with
outstretch
faulchion
i
guarding
the
blood
and
my
companion
shadowy
semblance
sad
meantime
discoursing
me
on
various
themes
the
soul
of
my
departed
mother
next
of
anticleia
came
daughter
of
brave
autolycus
whom
when
i
sought
the
shores
of
ilium
i
had
living
left
at
home
seeing
her
with
compassion
touch
i
wept
yet
even
her
although
it
pain
my
soul
forbad
relentless
to
approach
the
blood
till
with
tiresias
i
should
first
confer
then
came
the
spirit
of
the
theban
seer
himself
his
golden
sceptre
in
his
hand
who
knew
me
and
enquiring
thus
began
why
hapless
chief
leaving
the
cheerful
day
thou
to
behold
the
dead
and
this
unpleasant
land
but
from
the

awhile
receding

keen
away
that
i
may

i
thence
receding

again
the

prophet
then
approaching
drank
the

and
satisfied

me
thus

ulysses
but
a
god
will
make
that
voyage
difficult
for

i
judge
thou
wilt
not
pass
by
neptune
unperceiv
whose
anger
follows
thee
for
that
thou
hast
deprived
his

cyclops
of

at

however
after

attain
thy

which
if
attentive

thou
leave

though
after

ye
may
at

but
if
thou

them
i
denounce
destruction
on

shalt
thou
reach

in

then
pierced
by
keener
grief
in

consumes
and
like

the

flies
swift
away

haste
thou
back
to

and
taught
thyself
these
sacred

return
ulysses
viewing
thee
no

thou
at

some

subtle
hypocrite
of

no

far
who

musical
as

rehears
of

but
say
and
tell
me
true
thou
there
none

slain
in

warfare
lo
the
night
is
long
a
night
of

length
nor

tell
me
thy

for
i
could

then
thus
ulysses
replied
alcinoüs
high
exalted
over
all
phæacia
sons
the
time
suffices
yet
for
converse
both
and
sleep
and
if
thou
wish
to
hear
still
more
i
shall
not
spare
to
unfold
more
pitiable
woes
than
these
by
my
companions
in
the
end
destroy
who
saved
from
perils
of
war
at
ilium
perish
yet
in
their
return
victims
of
a
pernicious
woman
crime
now
when
chaste

the

sore
of

atreus
son
appear
encircled
by
a
throng
he
came
by
all
who
with
himself
beneath
ægisthus
roof
their
fate
fulfill
perishing
by
the
sword
he
drank
the
blood
and
knew
me
shrill
he
and
querulous
tears
trickling
bathed
his
cheeks
and
with
spread
palms
through
ardour
of
desire
he
sought
to
enfold
me
fast
but
vigour
none
or
force
as
erst
his
agile
limbs
inform
i
wept
at
the
sight
and
him
in
accents
wing
by
friendship
thus
address
ah
glorious
son
of
atreus
king
of
men
what
hand
inflicted
the
stroke
of
death
on
thee
say
didst
thou
perish
sunk
by
howling
tempests
irresistible
which
neptune
raised
or
on

by
force
of
hostile
multitudes
while
cutting
off

from
the
herd
or
driving
flocks
away
or
fighting
for
achaia
daughters
shut
within
some
city
bulwarks
close
besieged
i
ceased
when
agamemnon
thus
replied
ulysses
noble
chief
laertes
son
for
wisdom
famed
i
neither
perish
sunk
by
howling
tempests
irresistible
which
neptune
raised
nor
on

land
received
from
hostile
multitudes
the
fatal
blow
but
me
ægisthus
slew
my
woeful
death
with
my
own
pernicious
wife
he
plotted
with
a
show
of
love
sincere
bidding
me
to
his
board
where
as
the
ox
is
slaughter
at
his
crib
he
slaughter
such
was
my
dreadful
death
carnage
ensued
continual
of
my
friends
slain
all
around
as
boars
at
nuptial
feast
or
feast
convivial
of
some
wealthy
chief
thou
hast
already
witness
many
a
field
with
warriors
overspread
slain
one
by
one
but
that
dire
scene
had
most
thy
pity
moved
for
we
with
brimming
beakers
at
our
side
and
underneath
full
tables
bleeding
lay
blood
floated
all
the
pavement
then
the
cries
of
priam
daughter
sounded
in
my
ears
most
pitiable
of
all
cassandra
cries
whom
clytemnestra
close
beside
me
slew
expiring
as
i
lay
i
yet
to
grasp
my
faulchion
but
the
quick
withdrew
herself
nor
would
vouchsafe
to
close
my
languid
eyes
or
prop
my
drooping
chin
in
the
moment
when
i
sought
the
shades
so
that
the
thing
breathes
not
ruthless
and
fell
as
woman
once
resolv
on
such
a
deed
detestable
as
my
base
wife
contrived
the
murther
of
the
husband
of
her
youth
i
thought
to
have
return
welcome
to
all
to
my
own
children
and
domestic
train
but
she
past
measure
profligate
hath
poured
shame
on
herself
on
women
yet
unborn
and
even
on
the
virtuous
of
her
sex
he
ceas
to
whom
thus
answer
i
return
gods
how
severely
hath
the
plagued
the
house
of
atreus
even
from
the
first
by
female
counsels
we
for
helen
sake
have
died
and
clytemnestra
framed
while
thou
wast
far
remote
this
snare
for
thee
so
i
to

atrides
thus
replied
thou
therefore
be
not
pliant
overmuch
to
woman
trust
her
not
with
all
thy
mind
but
half
disclose
to
her
and
half
conceal
yet
from
thy

no

my

icarius
daughter

far
other

her
going
to

we
left

and
thy

who

with

a

safe
restored
to
his

ithaca
shall
see
him
soon
and
shall
clasp
his

in

as
nature
bids
but
me
my
cruel
one
indulged
not
with
the
dear
delight
to
gaze
on
my
orestes
for
she
slew
me
first
but
listen
treasure
what
i
now
impart

for

no

now
tell

ye
in

atrides
ask
not
me
whether
he
live
or

already
died
i
nothing

mere

thus
we
discoursing

stood
and

shedding
disconsolate
the

thus
began
brave

for

what
mightier

made
thee

thou
dared
to
penetrate
the

of

semblances
only
of

once
they
were

spake
to

i
thus
replied
o
peleus
son
achilles
bravest
far
of
all
achaia
race
i
here
arrived
seeking
tiresias
from
his
lips
to

how

safe
regain
the

ithaca
for
perpetual
i
have
neither
yet

as
for
thee

never

hath
known

like
thine
or
shall
whom

all
honour
as
a

and
who
here
resident
supreme
controul
among

indulge
not
then
achilles
causeless
grief
that
thou
hast
died
i
ceased
and
answer
thus
instant
received
renown
ulysses
think
not
death
a
theme
of
consolation
i
had
rather
live
the
servile
hind
for
hire
and
eat
the
bread
of
some
man
scantily
himself
sustain
than
empire
hold
all

of

he
as

say
also

predominates
in

enfeebled
limbs
for

none
in

the

no

me

when
in

of

i
the

of

troy
with

slain
oh

i
vigorous
as
then
repair
for

i

daunt
the
fiercest
who
presumes
to

to
despise
his

achilles
spake
to
whom
i
thus
replied
of
noble
peleus
have
i
nothing
heard
but
i
will
tell
thee
as
thou
the
truth
unfeign
of
neoptolemus
thy
son
for
him
myself
on

my
hollow
bark
from

ever
foremost

erroneous
nestor
and
myself
except
no

could
with
him
compare
oft
too
as
we
with

hemm
around

bulwarks
from
among
the
mingled
crowd
thy
son
sprang
foremost
into
martial
act
inferior
in
heroic
worth
to
none
beneath
him
fell
the
sons
of
troy
in
dreadful
fight
nor
have
i
to
name
distinctly
all
who
by
his
glorious
arm
exerted
in
the
cause
of
greece
expired
yet
will
i
name
eurypylus
the
son
of
telephus
an
hero
whom
his
sword
of
life
bereaved
and
all
around
him
the
plain
with
his
cetean
warriors
won
to
ilium
side
by
bribes
to
women
save
noble
memnon
only
i
beheld
no
chief
at
ilium
beautiful
as
he
again
when
we
within
the
horse
of
wood
framed
by
epeüs
sat
an
ambush
of
all
the
bravest
greeks
and
i
in
trust
was
placed
to
open
or
to
keep
the
hollow
fraud
then
chieftain
there
and
senator
of
greece
wiped
from
his
cheeks
the
tears
and
tremors
felt
in
limb
but
never
saw
i
changed
to
terror
hue
ruddy
cheek
no
tears
wiped
away
but
oft
he
press
me
to
go
forth
his
suit
with
enforcing
griping
hard
his
hilt
and
his
spear
and
dire
revenge
denouncing
ardent
on
the
race
of
troy
at
length
when
we
had
sack
the
lofty
town
of
priam
laden
with
abundant
spoils
he
safe
embark
neither
by
spear
or
shaft
aught
hurt
or
in
close
fight
by
faulchion
edge
as
oft
in
war
befalls
where
wounds
are
dealt
promiscuous
at
the
will
of
fiery
mars
so
i
then
striding
large
the

thence
withdrew
of

æacides
along

the

uttering

his

incensed
that
in

public
contest
for
the

worn
by
achilles
and
by

thrown
into

my

proved
troy

thus
began
o

son
of

telamon
canst
thou
remember
even
after
death
thy
wrath
against
me
kindled
for
the
sake
of
those
pernicious
arms
arms
which
the
gods
ordain
of
such
dire
consequence
to

caused
thy

how
to

a

the
good
fortune
to
render
him
apollo
bacchus
accused
her
to
diana
of
having
lain
with

in
his
temple
and
the
goddess
punished
her
with
death
probably
meaning
helen
this
is
surely
one
of
the
most
natural
strokes
to
be
found
in
any
poet
convinced
for
a
moment
by
the
virtues
of
penelope
he
mentioned
her
with
respect
but
recollecting
himself
suddenly
involves
even
her
in
his
general
ill
opinion
of
the
sex
begotten
in
him
by
the
crimes
of
clytemnestra
another

the
very
thought
that

possibly

thus

the

γυναίων

is
said
to
have
influenced
by
gifts
the

of
eurypylus
to
persuade
him
to
the
assistance
of
troy
he
being
himself
unwilling
to
engage
the
passage
through
defect
of
history
has
long
been
dark
and
commentators
have
adapted
different
senses
to
it
all
conjectural
the

to
have

a

eurypylus
was
king
κατ

asphodel
was
planted
on
the
graves

around
the
tombs
of
the
deceased
and
hence
the
supposition
that
the
stygian
plain
was
clothed
with
asphodel
βασαζοντα
must
have
this
sense
interpreted
by
what
follows
to
attempt
to
make
the
english
numbers
expressive
as
the
greek
is
a
labour
like
that
of
sisyphus
the
translator
has
done
what
he
could
it
is
now
perhaps
impossible
to
ascertain
with
precision
what
homer
meant
by
the
word
κραταιίς
which
he
uses
only
here
and
in
the
next
book
where
it
is
the
name
of
scylla
αναιδης
is
also
of
very
doubtful
explication
the
two
first
lines
of
the
following
book
seem
to
ascertain
the
true
meaning
of
the
conclusion
of
this
and
to
prove
sufficiently
that
by
ὠκεανὸς
here
homer
could
not
possibly
intend
any
other
than
a
river
in
those
lines
he
tells
us
in
the
plainest
terms
that
ship
left
the
stream
of
the
river
oceanus
and
arrived
in
the
open
diodorus

us
that

at

thrust

of

sending

on

fell

sorrowing

when

went
down

fell
my

beside

slept
while
me
the

by
the

leading

bade
me
sit
then
seated

thee
in

hour

thou
reach
the

the
hearts
enchant
of

on

the
wretch
who
unforewarn
approaching
hears
the

voice
his

and
fly
to
gratulate
his

him
the
sirens
sitting
in

meads
charm
with
mellifluous
song
while
all
around
the
bones

lie
of

putrid

lest
thy

hear
those
warblings
ere
thou
yet
approach
fill
all

as

fifty

flocks

if
anxious
for
a

thou
spare
those

though
after
much
endured
ye
may
at

she
ended
and
the
golden
morning
dawn
then
her
graceful
steps
she
back
through
the
isle
and
at
the
beach
arrived
i
summon
all
my
followers
to
ascend
the
bark
again
and
cast
the
hawsers
loose
they
at
my
voice
embarking
fill
in
ranks
the
seats
and
rowing
thresh
the
hoary
flood
and
now
melodious
circe
nymph
divine
sent
after
us
a

pleasant
companion
of
our
course
and
we
the
decks
and
benches
clear
untoiling
sat
while
managed
gales
sped
swift
the
bark
along
then
with
dejected
heart
thus
i
began
oh
friends
for
it
is
needful
that
not
one
or
two
alone
the
admonition
hear
of
circe
beauteous
prophetess
divine
to
all
i
speak
that
whether
we
escape
or
perish
all
may
be
at
least
forewarn
she
bids
us
first
avoid
the
song
of
the
sweet
sirens
and
their
meads
me
only
she
permits
those
strains
to
hear
but
ye
shall
bind
me
with
coercion
strong
of
cordage
to
the
and
by
no
struggles
to
be
loos
of
mine
but
should
i
supplicate
to
be
released
or
give
such
order
then
with
added
cords
be
it
your
part
to
bind
me
still
the
more
thus
with
distinct
precaution
i
prepared
my
people
rapid
in
her
course
meantime
my
gallant
bark
approach
the
sirens
isle
for
brisk
and
favourable
blew
the

then
fell
the
wind
suddenly
and
serene
a
breathless
calm
ensued
while
all
around
the
billows
slumber
lull
by
divine
my
people
and
the
folded
sails
bestowing
in
the
hold
sat
to

which
with
their
polish
blades
whiten
the
deep
i
then
with
edge
of
steel
minute
a
waxen
cake
chafed
it
and
moulded
it
between
my
palms
ere
long
the
ductile
mass
grew
warm
obedient
to
that
ceaseless
force
and
to
hyperion
beams
with
that
soft
liniment
i
fill
the
ears
of
my
companions
man
by
man
and
they
my
feet
and
arms
with
strong
coercion
bound
of
cordage
to
the
well
secured
then
down
they
sat
and
rowing
thresh
the
brine
but
when
with
rapid
course
we
had
arrived
within
such
distance
as
a
voice
may
reach
not
unperceived
by
them
the
gliding
bark
approach
and
thus
harmonious
they
began
ulysses
chief
by
tongue
extoll
achaia
boast
oh
hither
steer
thy
bark
here
stay
thy
course
and
listen
to
our
lay
these
shores
none
passes
in
his
sable
ship
till
first
the
warblings
of
our
voice
he
hear
then
happier
hence
and
wiser
he
departs
all
that
the
greeks
endured
and
all
the
ills
inflicted
by
the
gods
on
troy
we
know
know
all
that
passes
on
the
boundless
earth
so
they
with
voices
sweet
their
music
poured
melodious
on
my
ear
winning
with
ease
my
heart
desire
to
listen
and
by
signs
i
bade
my
people
instant
set
me
free
but
they
incumbent
row
and
from
their
seats
eurylochus
and
perimedes
sprang
with
added
cords
to
bind
me
still
the
more
this
danger
past
and
when
the
sirens
voice
now
left
remote
had
lost
its
to
charm
then
my
companions
freeing
from
the
wax
their
ears
deliver
me
from
my
restraint
the
island
left
afar
soon
i
huge
waves
and
smoke
and
horrid
heard
all
sat
aghast
forth
flew
at
once
the
oars
from
hand
and
with
a
clash
the
waves
smote
all
together
check
the
galley
stood
by
oars
no
longer
urged
and
i
throughout
the
bark
man
after
man
encouraged
all
addressing
thus
my
crew
we
meet
not
now
my
friends
our
first
distress
this
evil
is
not
greater
than
we
found
when
the
huge
cyclops
in
his
hollow
den
imprison
us
yet
even
thence
we
my
intrepidity
and
fertile
thought
opening
the
way
and
we
shall
recollect
these
dangers
also
in
due
time
with
joy
come
then
pursue
my
counsel
ye
your
seats
still
occupying
smite
the
furrow
flood
with
strokes
that
by
the
will
of
jove
we
may
escape
perchance
this
death
secure
to
thee
the
pilot
thus
i
speak
my
words
mark
thou
for
at
thy
touch
the
rudder
moves
this
smoke
and
these
tumultuous
waves
avoid
steer
wide
of
both
yet
with
an
eye
intent
on
yonder
rock
lest
unaware
thou
hold
too
near
a
course
and
plunge
us
into
harm
so
i
with
whose
advice
all
quick
complied
but
scylla
i
as
yet
named
not
that
woe
without
a
cure
lest
terrified
my
crew
should
all
renounce
their
oars
and
crowd
below
just
then
forgetful
of
the
strict
command
of
circe
not
to
arm
i
cloath
me
all
in
radiant
armour
grasp
two
spears
and
to
the
deck
ascended
at
the
prow
expecting
earliest
notice
there
what
time
the
scylla
should
annoy
my
friends
but
i
discern
her
not
nor
could
although
to
weariness
of
sight
the
dusky
rock
i
vigilant
explored
thus
many
a
groan
heaving
we
navigated
sad
the
streight
for
here
stood
scylla
while
charybdis
there
with
hoarse
throat
deep
absorb
the
briny
flood
oft
as
she
vomited
the
deluge
forth
like
water
cauldron
a
furious
fire
the
whirling
deep
all
murmur
and
the
spray
on
both
those
rocky
summits
fell
in
but
when
she
suck
the
salt
wave
down
again
then
all
the
pool
appear
wheeling
about
within
the
rock
rebellow
and
the
sea
drawn
off
into
that
gulph
disclosed
to
view
the
oozy
bottom
us
pale
horror
seized
thus
dreading
death
with
eyes
we
charybdis
meantime
scylla
from
the
bark
caught
six
away
the
bravest
of
my
friends
with
eyes
that
moment
on
my
ship
and
crew
retorted
i
beheld
the
legs
and
arms
of
those
whom
she
uplifted
in
the
air
on
me
they
call
my
name
the
last
last
time
pronouncing
then
in
agony
of
heart
as
when
from
some
bold
point
among
the
rocks
the
angler
with
his
taper
rod
in
hand
casts
forth
his
bait
to
snare

in

and
on
the

the
voice
of

bellowing
in

heard
and
of

then
dropp
the
word
into
my
memory
of
the
sightless
seer
theban

and
the
caution
strict
of
circe
my
ææan
monitress
who
with
such
force
had
caution
me
to
avoid
the
island
of
the

of

thus
then
to
my
companions
sad
i
spake
hear
ye
my
friends
although
long
time
distress
the
words
prophetic
of
the
theban
seer
and
of
ææan
circe
whose
advice
was
oft
repeated
to
me
to
avoid
this
island
of
the
sun
joy
of
mankind
there
said
the
goddess
dread
your
heaviest
woes
pass
the
isle
therefore
scudding
swift
away
i
ceased
they
me
with
consternation
heard
and
harshly
thus
eurylochus
replied
ulysses
ruthless
chief
no

impair
thy
strength
of
senseless
iron
thou
art
form
who
thy
companions
weary
and
to
disembark
on
this
fair

where
now
at
last
we
might
with
ease
regale
thou
rash
us
leaving
it
afar
to
roam
all
night
the
ocean
dreary
waste
but
winds
to
ships
injurious
spring
by
night
and
how
shall
we
escape
a
dreadful
death
if
chance
a
sudden
gust
from
south
arise
or
stormy
west
that
dash
in
pieces
oft
the
vessel
even
in
the

despight
prepare
we
rather
now
as
night
enjoins
our
evening
fare
beside
the
sable
bark
in
which
at
peep
of
day
we
may
again
launch
forth
secure
into
the
boundless
flood
he
ceas
whom
all
applauded
then
i
knew
that
sorrow
by
the
will
of
adverse
approach
and
in
wing
accents
thus
replied
i
suffer
force
eurylochus
and
yield
by
numbers
come
then
swear
ye
all
a
solemn
oath
that
should
we
find
an
herd
or
flock
none
here
shall
either
sheep
or
bullock
slay
by
appetite
profane
seduced
but
shall
the
viands
eat
content
which
from
immortal
circe
we
received
i
spake
they
readily
a
solemn
oath
sware
all
and
when
their
oath
was
fully
sworn
within
a
creek
where
a
fresh
fountain
rose
they
moor
the
bark
and
issuing
began
brisk
preparation
of
their
evening
cheer
but
when
nor
hunger
now
nor
thirst
unsated
recollecting
then
their
friends
by
scylla
seized
and
at
her
cave
devour
they
mourn
nor
ceased
to
mourn
them
till
they
slept
the
night
third
portion
come
when
now
the
stars
had
travers
the
jove
call
forth
a
vehement
wind
with
tempest
charged
menacing
earth
and
sea
with
pitchy
clouds
tremendous
and
the
night
fell
dark
from
but
when
aurora
daughter
of
the
day
look
rosy
forth
we
haled
drawn
inland
more
our
bark
into
a
grot
where
nymphs
were
wont
graceful
to
tread
the
dance
or
to
repose
convening
there
my
friends
i
thus
began
my
friends
food
fails
us
not
but
bread
is
yet
and
wine
on
board
abstain
we
from
the
herds
lest
harm
ensue
for
ye
behold
the
flocks
and
herds
of
a
most
potent
god
the
sun
whose
eye
and
watchful
ear
none
may
elude
so
saying
i
sway
the
minds
of
all
a
month
complete
the
south
wind
ceaseless
blew
nor
other
wind
blew
next
save
east
and
south
yet
they
while
neither
food
nor
rosy
wine
fail
them
the
herds
harm
not
through
fear
to
die
but
our
provisions
failing
they
employed
whole
days
in
search
of
food
snaring
with
hooks
birds
fishes
of
what
kind
they
might
by
famine
urged
i
solitary
meantime
the

seeking
by
to

to

when
roving
thus
the

i
had
at
length
left
all
my
crew
remote
laving
my
hands
where
shelter
warm
i
found
from
the
rude
blast
i
supplicated
above
but
they
my
answer
with
slumbers
soft
shed
my
eyes
and
with
pernicious
art
eurylochus
the
while
my
friends
harangued
my
friends
afflicted
as
ye
are
yet

a
death
however
caused
abhorrence

in
miserable
man
but
death
by
famine
is
a
fate
of
all
most
to
be
fear
come
let
us
hither
drive
and
sacrifice
to
the
immortal
the
best
of
all
the
oxen
of
the
sun
resolving
thus
that
soon
as
we
shall
reach
our
native
ithaca
we
will
erect
to
bright
hyperion
an
illustrious
fane
which
with
magnificent
and
gifts
we
will
enrich
but
should
he
chuse
to
sink
our
vessel
for
his
stately
beeves
incensed
and
should
with
him
all
conspire
our
death
i
rather
had
with
open
mouth
at
once
meeting
the
billows
perish
than
by
slow
and
pining
waste
here
in
this
desert
isle
so
spake
eurylochus
whom
all
approved
then
driving
all
the
fattest
of
the
herd
few
paces
only
for
the
sacred
beeves
grazed
rarely
distant
from
the
bark
they
stood
compassing
them
around
and
grasping
each
green
foliage
newly
pluck
from
saplings
tall
for
barley
none
in
all
our
bark
remain
worshipp
the
gods
in
made
they
slew
and
flay
them
and
the
thighs
with
double
fat
investing
spread
them
with
slices
crude
no
wine
had
they
with
which
to
consecrate
the
blazing
rites
but
with
libation
poor
of
water
hallow
the
interior
parts
now
when
the
thighs
were
burnt
and
each
had
shared
his
portion
of
the
maw
and
when
the
rest
and
scored
hung
roasting
at
the
fire
sleep
in
that
moment
suddenly
my
eyes
forsaking
to
the
shore
i
bent
my
way
but
ere
the
station
of
our
bark
i
reach
the
steam
greeted
me
at
the
scent
i
wept
aloud
and
to
the
gods
exclaim
oh
jupiter
and
all
ye
above
with
cruel
sleep
and
fatal
ye
have
my
cares
to
rest
such
horrible
offence
meantime
my
rash
companions
have
devised
then
flew
lampetia
to
the
sun
at
once
with
tidings
of
his
slaughter
beeves
and
he
incensed
the
immortals
thus
address
jove
and
ye
everlasting
divine
avenge
me
instant
on
the
crew
profane
of
laertiades
ulysses
friends
have
dared
to
slay
my
beeves
which
i
with
joy
beheld
both
when
i
climb
the
starry
and
when
to
earth
i
sloped
my
westring
wheels
but
if
they
yield
me
not
amercement
due
and
honourable
for
my
loss
to
hell
i
will
descend
and
give
the
ghosts
my
beams
then
thus
the
god
replied
sun
shine
thou
still
on
the
immortal
and
on
the
teeming
earth
frail

abode
my
candent
bolts
can
in
a

reach
and
split
their
flying
bark
in
the
these
things
calypso
told
me
taught
herself
by
herald
hermes
as
she
oft
affirm
but
when
descending
to
the
shore
i
at
length
my
bark
with
aspect
stern
and
tone
i
reprimanded
them
yet
no
redress
could
frame
or
remedy
the
beeves
were
dead
soon
follow
signs
portentous
sent
from
the
skins
all
crept
and
on
the
spits
the
flesh
both
roast
and
raw
bellow
as
with
the
voice
of

thus
my
devoted
friends
driving
the
fattest
oxen
of
the
sun
feasted
six
days
entire
but
when
the
by
mandate
of
saturnian
jove
appeared
the
storm
then
ceased
to
rage
and
we
again
embarking
launch
our
galley
rear
the
mast
and
gave
our
unfurl
canvas
to
the

the

left
afar

and

my

now
came
shrill

a
stormy
gust
snapp
sheer

on

backward
fell

with

she
smitten
by

of

quaked
all
her

with

and
her

headlong
my

plunged
like

i
the

together
on

both
i
sat
borne
helpless
onward
by
the
dreadful

and
now
the

subsided
and
the

arose
instead
with
charged
for
me
that
i
might

back
my

again
to

when
the

at

arrived
it
was
the
time
when

by

upborne
i

where
to

and
distant

all

therefore
hard
i
clench
the

till
she
disgorg
again

not

they

the

made

with

down

in

slumber
on

should

homeward

they

denounced
against

ulysses
but
with
jove
thus
first
advised
eternal
sire
i
shall
no
longer
share
respect
and
reverence
among
the
gods
since
now
phæacia
mortal
race
have
to
honour
me
though
from
myself
derived
it
was
my
purpose
that
by
many
an
ill
harass
ulysses
should
have
reach
his
home
although
to
intercept
him
whose
return
thyself
had
promis
was
my
intent
but
him
swiftly
the
waves
they
have
conducted
and
have
set
him
down
in
ithaca
with
countless
gifts
enrich
with
brass
and
tissued
raiment
and
with
gold
much
treasure
more
than
he
had
home
even
had
he
arrived
with
all
his
share
allotted
to
him
of
the
spoils
of
troy
to
whom
the
god
replied
what
hast
thou
spoken
shaker
of
the
shores
neptune
fear
not
thee
the
gods
will
despise
dangerous
were
the
deed
to
cast
dishonour
on
a
god
by
birth
more
ancient
and
more
potent
far
than
they
but
if
profanely
rash
a
mortal
man
should
dare
to
slight
thee
to
avenge
the
wrong
some
future
day
is
ever
in
thy
accomplish
all
thy
pleasure
thou
art
free
him
answer
then
the
shaker
of
the
shores
jove
that
pleasure
i
would
soon
perform
as
thou
hast
said
but
that
i
watch
thy
mind
continual
fearful
to
offend
my
purpose
is
now
to
destroy
amid
the
dreary
deep
yon
fair
phæacian
bark
return
from
safe
conveyance
of
her
freight
so
shall
they
waft
such
home
no
more
and
she
shall
hide
their
city
to
a
rock
transform
of
mountainous
size
him
then
jove
answer
of
the
clouds
perform
it
o
my
brother
and
the
deed
thus
done
shall
best
be
done
what
time
the
people
shall
from
the
city
her
approach
descry
fix
her
to
stone
transform
but
still
in
shape
a
gallant
bark
near
to
the
coast
that
all
may
wonder
seeing
her
transform
to
stone
of
size
to
hide
their
city
from
the
view
these
words
once
heard
the
shaker
of
the
shores
instant
to
scheria
maritime
abode
of
the
phæacians
went
arrived
he
watch
and
now
the
flying
bark
full
near
approach
when
neptune
meeting
her
with
palm
depress
her
at
a
stroke
and
she
became
stone
then
neptune
went
his
way
phæacia
sons
meantime
conferring
stood
and
thus
in
accents
wing
th
amazed
spectator
to
his
fellow
spake
ah
who
hath
sudden
check
the
vessel
course
homeward
this
moment
she
was
all
in
view
thus
they
unconscious
of
the
cause
to
whom
alcinoüs
instructing
them
replied
ye
gods
a
prophecy
now
strikes
my
mind
with
force
my
father
he
was
wont
to
say
neptune
resents
it
that
we
safe
conduct
natives
of
region
to
their
home
he
also
spake
prophetic
of
a
day
when
a
phæacian
gallant
bark
after
conveyance
of
a
stranger
hence
should
perish
in
the
dreary
deep
and
changed
to
a
huge
mountain
cover
all
the
town
so
spake
my
father
all
whose
words
we
see
this
day
fulfill
thus
therefore
act
we
all
unanimous
henceforth
no
longer
bear
the
stranger
home
when
such
shall
here
arrive
and
we
will
sacrifice
without
delay
twelve
chosen
bulls
to
neptune
if
perchance
he
will
commiserate
us
and
forbear
to
hide
our
town
behind
a
mountain
height
he
spake
they
terrified
the
bulls
prepared
thus
all
phæacia
senators
and
chiefs
his
altar
compassing
in
adored
the
ocean
god
meantime
ulysses
woke
unconscious
where
stretch
on
his
native
soil
he
lay
and
knew
it
not
exiled
for
pallas
progeny
of
jove
a
cloud
drew
dense
around
him
that
ere
yet
agnized
by
others
he
might
wisdom
learn
from
her
neither
to
citizens
nor
yet
to
friends
reveal
nor
even
to
his
own
espoused
till
first
he
should
avenge
complete
his
wrongs
domestic
from
those
suitors
proud
sustained
all
objects
therefore
in
the
hero
eyes
seem
alien
long
commodious
ports
rocks
and
trees
of
amplest
growth
arising
fixt
he
stood
his
native
soil
contemplating
till
with
expanded
palms
both
thighs
he
smote
and
plaintive
thus
began
ah
me
what
mortal
race
inhabits
here
rude
are
they
contumacious
and
unjust
or
hospitable
and
who
fear
the
gods
where
now
shall
i
secrete
these
stores
where
wander
i
myself
i
would
that
still
phæacians
own
them
and
i
had
arrived
in
the
dominions
of
some
other
king
magnanimous
who
would
have
and
sent
me
to
my
native
home
secure
now
neither
know
i
where
to
place
my
wealth
nor
can
i
leave
it
here
lest
it
become
another
prey
alas
phæacia
chiefs
not
altogether
wise
i
deem
or
just
who
have
misplaced
me
in
another
land
promis
to
bear
me
to
the
pleasant
shores
of
ithaca
but
have
not
so
perform
jove
guardian
of
the
suppliant
rights
who
all
transgressors
marks
and
punishes
all
wrong
avenge
me
on
the
race
but
hold
i
will
revise
my
stores
so
shall
i
know
if
they
have
left
me
here
of
aught
despoiled
so
saying
he
number
carefully
the
gold
the
vases
tripods
bright
and
tissued
robes
but
nothing
miss
of
all
then
he
his
native
isle
with
pensive
steps
and
slow
pacing
the
border
of
the
billowy
flood
forlorn
but
while
he
wept
pallas
approach
in
form
a
shepherd
stripling
girlish
fair
in
feature
such
as
are
the
sons
of
kings
a
sumptuous
mantle
his
shoulders
hung
sandals
his
nice
feet
upbore
and
a
smooth
javelin
glitter
in
his

ulysses
joyful
at
the
sight
his
steps
turn
brisk
toward
her
whom
he
thus
address
sweet
youth
since
thee
of
all
mankind
i
first
encounter
in
this
land
unknown
all
hail
come
not
with
purposes
of
harm
to
me
these
save
and
save
me
also
i
prefer
to
thee
as
to
some

my
and
clasp
thy
knees
a
suppliant
say
and
tell
me
true
what
land
what
people
who
inhabit
here
is
this
some
isle
delightful
or
a
shore
of
fruitful
sloping
to
the
sea
then
pallas
thus
goddess
stranger
thou
sure
art
simple
or
hast
dwelt
far
distant
hence
if
of
this
land
thou
ask
it
is
not
trust
me
of
so
little
note
but
known
to
many
both
to
those
who
dwell
toward
the
and
to
others
placed
behind
it
distant
in
the
dusky
west
rugged
it
is
not
yielding
level
course
to
the
swift
steed
and
yet
no
barren
spot
however
small
but
rich
in
wheat
and
wine
nor
wants
it
rain
or
fertilising
dew
but
pasture
green
to
goats
and
beeves
affords
trees
of
all
kinds
and
fountains
never
dry
ithaca
therefore
stranger
is
a
name
known
at
troy
a
city
by
report
at
no
small
distance
from
achaia
shore
the
goddess
ceased
then
chief
ulysses
happy
in
his
native
land
so
taught
by
pallas
progeny
of
jove
in
accents
wing
her
utter
prompt
not
truth
but
figments
to
truth
opposite
for
guile
in
him
stood
never
at
a
pause
yonder
flood
even
in
spacious
crete
i
heard
of
ithaca
where
now
it
seems
i
have
myself
with
these
my
stores
arrived
not
richer
stores
than
flying
thence
i
left
to
my
own
children
for
from
crete
i
fled
for
slaughter
of
orsilochus
the
swift
son
of
idomeneus
whom
none
in
speed
could
equal
throughout
all
that
spacious
isle
his
purpose
was
to
plunder
me
of
all
my
trojan
spoils
which
to
obtain
much
woe
i
had
in
battle
and
by
storms
endured
for
that
i
would
not
gratify
his
sire
fighting
beside
him
in
the
fields
of
troy
but
led
a
band
him
from
the
field
returning
homeward
with
my
brazen
spear
i
smote
in
ambush
waiting
his
return
at
the
with
a
friend
unwonted
darkness
over
all
the
that
night
prevailed
nor
any
eye
of
man
observed
us
but
unseen
i
slew
the
youth
no
sooner
then
with
my
sharp
spear
of
life
i
had
bereft
him
than
i
sought
a
ship
mann
by
renown
phæacians
whom
with
gifts
part
of
my
spoils
and
by
requests
i
won
i
bade
them
land
me
on
the
pylian
shore
or
in
fair
elis
by
th
epeans
ruled
but
they
reluctant
were
by
violent
winds
devious
thence
for
fraud
they
purposed
none
thus
through
constraint
we
here
arrived
by
night
and
with
much
difficulty
push
the
ship
into
safe
harbour
nor
was
mention
made
of
food
by
any
though
all
needed
food
but
disembark
in
haste
on
shore
we
lay
i
weary
slept
profound
and
they
my
goods
forth
heaving
from
the
bark
beside
me
placed
the
treasures
on
the
where
i
slept
then
reimbarking
to
the
populous
coast
steer
of
sidonia
and
me
left
forlorn
he
ceased
then
smiled
minerva
and
stroaked
his
cheek
in
form
a
woman
now
beauteous
majestic
in
all
elegant
arts
accomplish
and
with
accents
wing
replied
who
passes
thee
in
artifice
and
in
imposture
various
need
shall
find
of
all
his
policy
although
a
god
canst
thou
not
cease
inventive
as
thou
art
and
subtle
from
the
wiles
which
thou
hast
since
thou
wast
infant
and
from
tricks
of
speech
delusive
even
in
thy
native
land
but
come
dismiss
we
these
ingenious
shifts
from
our
discourse
in
which
we
both
excel
for
thou
of
all
men
in
expedients
most
and
eloquence
and
i
throughout
all
have
praise
for
wisdom
and
for
art
and
thou
not
thine
athenæan
aid
pallas
jove
daughter
who
in
all
thy
toils
assist
thee
and
defend
i
gave
thee
t
engage
the
hearts
of
all
phæacia
sons
and
here
arrive
now
counsels
to
frame
discrete
with
thee
and
to
conceal
the
stores
to
thee
by
the
rich
phæacian
chiefs
on
my
suggestion
at
thy
going
thence
i
will
inform
thee
also
what
distress
and
hardship
under
thy
own
thou
must
endure
which
since
constraint
enjoins
bear
patiently
and
neither
man
apprize
nor
woman
that
thou
hast
arrived
forlorn
and
vagabond
but
silent
undergo
what
wrongs
soever
from
the
hands
of
men
to
whom
ulysses
replied
o
goddess
thou
art
able
to
elude
wherever
met
the
keenest
eye
of
man
for
thou
all
shapes
yet
this
i
know
certainly
that
i
ever
found
thee
kind
long
as
achaia
heroes
fought
at
troy
but
when
the
lofty
of
priam
laid
in
dust
we
and
by
the
will
of
achaia
fleet
was
scatter
wide
thenceforth
o
daughter
wise
of
jove
i
thee
saw
not
nor
thy
appearance
in
my
ship
once
mark
to
rid
me
of
my
woes
but
always
bearing
in
my
breast
a
heart
with
anguish
i
roam
till
by
the
gods
relieved
at
length
and
till
with
gracious
words
thyself
didst
in
phæacia
opulent
land
confirm
my
courage
and
my
guide
but
i
adjure
thee
in
thy
father
name
o
tell
me
truly
for
i
can
not
hope
that
i
have
reach
fair
ithaca
i
tread
some
other
soil
and
thou
it
mine
to
mock
me
merely
and
deceive
oh
say
am
i
in
ithaca
in
truth
at
home
thus
then
minerva
the
such
caution
in
thy
breast
always
prevails
distrustful
but
i
know
thee
eloquent
with
wisdom
and
with
ready
thought
endued
and
can
not
leave
thee
therefore
thus
for
what
man
save
ulysses
after
long
would
not
pant
to
see
at
once
his
home
his
children
and
his
wife
but
thou
neither
to
know
nor
ask
concerning
them
till
some
experience
first
thou
make
of
her
whose
wasted
youth
is
spent
in
barren
solitude
and
who
in
tears
ceaseless
her
nights
and
woeful
days
consumes
i
was
ignorant
but
well
foreknew
that
not
till
after
loss
of
all
thy
friends
thou
return
but
loth
i
was
to
oppose
neptune
my
father
brother
sore
incensed
for
his
son
sake
deprived
of
sight
by
thee
but
i
will
give
thee
proof
come
now
survey
these
marks
of
ithaca
and
be
convinced
this
is
the
port
of
phorcys
sage
that
the
huge
olive
at
the
haven
head
fast
by
it
thou
the
pleasant
cove
umbrageous
to

devoted
named
the

this
the
cavern
is
where
thou
wast
wont
to
offer
to
the
nymphs
many
a
whole
hecatomb
and
yonder
stands
the
mountain
neritus
with
forests
cloath
so
saying
the
goddess
scatter
from
before
his
eyes
all
darkness
and
he
knew
the
land
then
felt
ulysses
hero
transport
unutterable
seeing
plain
once
more
his
native
isle
he
kiss
the
glebe
and
with
uplifted
hands
the
nymphs
ador
nymphs
naiads
jove
own
daughters
i
to
see
you
more
whom
yet
with
happy
vows
i
now
can
hail
again
gifts
as
of
old
we
will
hereafter
at
your
shrines
present
if
pallas
huntress
of
the
spoils
grant
life
to
me
and
manhood
to
my
son
then
pallas
progeny
of
jove
take
courage
trouble
not
thy
mind
with
thoughts
now
needless
haste
delay
not
far
within
this
hallow
cave
recess
place
we
at
once
thy
precious
stores
that
they
may
thine
remain
then
muse
together
on
thy
wisest
course
so
saying
the
goddess
enter
deep
the
cave
caliginous
and
its
secret
nooks
explored
from
side
to
side
meantime
ulysses
brought
all
his
stores
into
it
the
gold
the
brass
and
robes
magnificent
his
gifts
received
from
the
phæacians
safe
he
lodg
them
all
and
pallas
daughter
of
jove
closed
fast
herself
the
cavern
with
a
stone
then
on
the
consecrated
olive
root
both
seated
they
in
consultation
plann
the
deaths
of
those
injurious
suitors
proud
and
pallas
goddess
thus
began
laertes
noble
son
ulysses

by
what
means
likeliest
thou
shalt
assail
those
shameless
suitors
who
have
now
controuled
three
years
thy
family
thy
matchless
wife
with
language
amorous
and
with
spousal
gifts
urging
importunate
but
she
with
tears
watching
thy
wish
return
hope
gives
to
all
by
messages
of
promise
sent
to
each
framing
far
other
purposes
the
while
then

thus
ulysses
wise

ah

miserable
fate
had
surely
met
me
in
my

abode
but
for
thy
gracious
warning
divine
come
then
devise
the
means
teach
me
thyself
the
way
to
vengeance
and
my
soul
inspire
with
daring

from
the
brows
of

zeal

of
enterprize
arrive
shalt
thou
assail
them
many
as
i
judge
of
those
proud
suitors
who
devour
thy
wealth
shall
leave
their
brains
then
on
thy
palace
floor
but
come

disguise
thee
so
that

commodious

lawn
that
structure
neat
eumæus
in
the

of

had
raised
himself
with
stones
from
quarries
hewn
unaided
by
laertes
or

with

thorns
he
fenced
it
safe
around

with

stakes
from

of

without
twelve
penns
he
made
within

for

and
in

lay
fifty
pregnant
females
on
the
floor
the

all
slept
without

far
thinn
by
the
princely
wooers
at

were
occupied

the

had
sought
the
city
whither
for
the

use
with
no
good
will
but
by
constraint
he
drove
a
boar
that
sacrificing
to
the
gods
th
imperious
guests
might
on
his
flesh
regale
soon
as
those
clamorous
the
approach
saw
of
ulysses
baying
loud
they
ran
toward
him
he
as
ever
squatted
and
let
his
staff
fall
from
his
hand
yet
foul
indignity
he
had
endured
there
at
his
own
farm
but
that
the
swain
following
his
dogs
in
haste
sprang
through
the
porch
to
his
assistance
letting
fall
the
hide
with
chiding
voice
and
vollied
stones
he
soon
drove
them
apart
and
thus
his

bespake

man
one
moment
more
and
these
my
dogs
had
past
doubt
worried
thee
who
have
proved
so
slain
a
source
of
obloquy
to
me
but
other
pangs
the
gods
and
other
woes
to
me
have
who
here
lamenting
sit
my
godlike
master
and
his
fatted
swine
nourish
for
others
use
while
he
perchance
a
in
some
foreign
city
seeks
fit
sustenance
and
none
obtains
if
still
indeed
he
live
and
view
the

old

follow
me
into
the
house
that
thou
at

with
plenteous
food
refresh
and
cheer
with
wine
sufficient
disclose
both
who
thou
art
and
all
that
thou
hast
borne

saying

ulysses
and
thick
bundles
spread
of
twigs
beneath
him
cover
with
the
shaggy
skin
of
a
wild
goat
of
which
he
made
his

easy
and
large
the

so
received
rejoiced
and
thus
his
gratitude
express
jove
grant
thee
and
the
gods
above
my
host
for
such
beneficence
thy
chief
desire
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
my
guest
i
should
offend
treating
with
scorn
the
stranger
though
a
poorer
should
arrive
than
thyself
for
all
the
poor
that
are
and
all
the
strangers
are
the
care
of
jove
little
and
with
good
will
is
all
that
lies
within
my
scope
no
man
can
much
expect
from
servants
living
in
continual
fear
under
young
masters
for
the
gods
no
doubt
have
intercepted
my
own
lord
return
from
whom
great
kindness
i
had
else
received
with
such
a
recompense
as
servants
gain
from
masters
house
and
competence
and
lovely
wife
from
many
a
wooer
won
whose
industry
should
have
requited
well
his
goodness
with
such
blessing
from
the
gods
as
now
attends
me
in
my
present
charge
much
had
i
therefore
prosper
had
my
lord
grown
old
at
home
but
he
hath
died
i
would
that
the
whole
house
of
helen
one
and
all
might
perish
too
for
she
hath
many
slain
who
like
my
master
went
glory
to
win
for
agamemnon
in
the
fields
of
troy
so
saying
he
girdled
quick
his
tunic
close
and
issuing
sought
the
styes
thence
bringing
two
of
the
imprison
herd
he
slaughter
both
singed
them
and
slash
and
spitted
them
and
placed
the
whole
banquet
spits
and
all
reeking
before
ulysses
last
with
flour
he
sprinkled
them
and
filling
with
rich
wine
his
ivy
goblet
to
his
master
sat
opposite
whom
inviting
thus
he
said
now
eat
my
guest
such
as
a
servant
may
i
set
before
thee
neither
large
of
growth
nor
fat
the
fatted
those
the
suitors
eat
fearless
of
and
pitiless
of
man
yet
deeds
unjust
as
theirs
the
blessed
gods
love
not
they
honour
equity
and
right
even
an
hostile
band
when
they
invade
a
foreign
shore
which
by
consent
of
jove
they
plunder
and
with
laden
ships
depart
even
they
with
terrours
quake
of
wrath
divine
but
these
are
wiser
these
must
sure
have
from
some
true
oracle
my
master
death
who
neither
deign
with
decency
to
woo
nor
yet
to
seek
their
homes
but
boldly
waste
his
substance
shameless
now
and
sparing
nought
jove
hath
us
yet
the
night
or
day
when
with
a
single
victim
or
with
two
they
would
content
them
and
his
empty
jars
witness
how
fast
the
use
his
wine
time
was
when
he
was
rich
indeed
such
wealth
no
hero
own
on
yonder
continent
nor
yet
in
ithaca
no
twenty
chiefs
could
match
with
all
their
treasures
his
alone
i
tell
thee
their
amount
twelve
herds
of
his
the
mainland
graze
as
many
flocks
of
sheep
as
many
droves
of
swine
and
hirelings
there
and
servants
of
his
own
seed
for
his
use
as
many
flocks
of
goats
his
goats
not
fewer
than
eleven
flocks
here
also
graze
the
margin
of
his
fields
under
the
eye
of
servants
and
servant
day
brings
home
the
goat
of
all
his
flock
largest
and
best
but
as
for
me
i
have
these
swine
in
charge
of
which
selected
with
exactest
care
from
all
the
herd
i
send
the
prime
to
them
he
ceas
meantime
ulysses
ate
and
drank
voracious
meditating
mute
the
death
of
those
proud
suitors
his
repast
at
length
concluded
and
his
appetite
sufficed
eumæus
gave
him
charged
with
wine
the
cup
from
which
he
drank
himself
he
glad
received
the
boon
and
in
wing
accents
thus
began
my
friend
and
who
was

wealthy
and
brave
as
thou
the
chief
who
purchased
thee
thou

perish
for
the
of
agamemnon
name
him
i
perchance
may
have
beheld
the
hero
none
can
say
but
jove
and
the
inhabitants
of
that
i
saw
him
and
may
not
impart
news
of
him
i
have
roam
through
many
a
clime
to
whom
the
noble
thus
replied
alas
old
man
no
tale
of
him
will
gain
his
consort
credence
or
his
son
for
wanting
entertainment
forge
falsehoods
for
bread
and
wilfully
deceive
no
lands
in

but
he
seeks
with
feign
intelligence
my
mistress
ear
she
welcomes
all
and
while
she
questions
each
minutely
from
her
lids
lets
fall
the
tear
affectionate
as
well
beseems
a

whose
mate
hath

in

thou
thyself
no
doubt
my
hoary
friend
would
any
furnish
thee
with
decent
vest
and
mantle
fabricate
a
tale
with
ease
yet
sure
it
is
that
dogs
and
fowls
long
since
his
skin
have
stript
or
fishes
of
the
deep
have
eaten
him
and
on
some
distant
shore
whelm
in
deep
sands
his
bones
are
laid
so
hath
he
perish
whence
to
all
his
friends
but
chiefly
to
myself
sorrow
of
heart
for
such
another
lord
gentle
as
he
wherever
sought
i
have
no
hope
to
find
though
i
should
wander
even
to
the
house
of
my
own
father
neither
yearns
my
heart
so
feelingly
though
that
desiring
too
to
see
once
more
my
parents
and
my
home
as
to
behold
ulysses
yet
again
ah
stranger
absent
as
he
is
his
name
fills
me
with
for
he
lov
me
much
cared
for
me
much
and
though
we
meet
no
more
holds
still
an
elder
brother
part
in
me
him
answer
then
the
hero
my
friend
since
his
return
in
thy
account
is
an
event
impossible
and
thy
mind
always
incredulous
that
hope
rejects
i
shall
not
slightly
speak
but
with
an
oath
ulysses
comes
again
and
i
demand
no
more
than
that
the
boon
such
news
deserves
be
me
soon
as
he
shall
reach
his
home
then
give
me
vest
and
mantle
fit
to
wear
which
ere
that
hour
much
as
i
need
them
both
i
neither
ask
nor
will
accept
from
thee
for
him
whom
poverty
can
force
aside
from
truth
i
hate
him
as
the
gates
of
hell
be
jove
of
all
in
my
witness
first
then
this
thy
hospitable
board
and
last
the
household
gods
of
the
illustrious
chief
himself
ulysses
to
whose
gates
i
go
that
all
my
words
shall
surely
be
fulfill
in
this
same
year
ulysses
shall
arrive
ere
this
month
closed
another
month
succeed
he
shall
return
and
punish
all
who
dare
insult
his
consort
and
his
noble
son
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
old
friend
that
boon
thou
wilt
earn
from
me
ulysses
comes
no
more
but
thou
thy
wine
drink
quietly
and
let
us
find
at
length
some
other
theme
recall
not
this
again
to
my
remembrance
for
my
soul
is
grieved
oft
as
reminded
of
my
honour
lord
let
the
oath
rest
and
let
ulysses
come
as
myself
and
as
penelope
and
as
his
ancient
father
and
his
son
godlike
telemachus
all
wish
he
may
ay
there
i
feel
again
nor
cease
to
mourn
his
son
telemachus
who
when
the
gods
had
him
growth
like
a
young
plant
and
i
well
hoped
that
nought
inferior
he
should
prove
in
person
or
in
mind
to
his
own
sire
hath
lost
through
influence
human
or
divine
i
know
not
how
his
sober
intellect
and
after
tidings
of
his
sire
is
gone
to
pylus
his
return
meantime
in
ambush
hidden
the
proud
suitors
wait
that
the
whole
house
may
perish
of
arcesias
named
in
ithaca
no
more
but
whether
he
have
fallen
or
let
him
rest
also
whom
saturnian
jove
protect
but
come
my
ancient
guest
now
let
me
learn
thy
own
afflictions
answer
me
in
truth
who
and
whence
art
thou
in
what
city
born
where
dwell
thy
parents
in
what
kind
of
ship
thou
the
mariners
why
brought
they
thee
to
ithaca
and
of
what
land
are
they
for
that
on
foot
thou
us
not
is
sure
him
answer
then
ulysses
i
will
with
truth
resolve
thee
and
if
here
within
thy
cottage
sitting
we
had
wine
and
food
for
many
a
day
and
business
none
but
to
regale
at
ease
while
others
toiled
i
could
exhaust
the
year
complete
my
woes
rehearsing
nor
at
last
rehearse
entire
my
sorrows
by
the
will
of
sustained
i
boast
me
sprung
from
ancestry
in
spacious
crete
son
of
a
wealthy
sire
who
other
sons
train
in
his
house
born
of
his
wedded
wife
but
he
begat
me
on
his
purchased
concubine
whom
yet
dear
as
his
other
sons
in
wedlock
born
castor
hylacides
esteem
and
lov
for
him
i
boast
my
father
him
in
crete
while
yet
he
liv
all
reverenc
as
a
god
so
rich
so
and
so
blest
was
he
with
sons
of
highest
praise
but
death
the
doom
of
all
him
bore
to
pluto
drear
abode
and
his
illustrious
sons
among
themselves
portion
his
goods
by
lot
to
me
indeed
they
gave
a
dwelling
and
but
little
more
yet
for
my
virtuous
qualities
i
won
a
wealthy
bride
for
i
was
neither
vain
nor
base
forlorn
as
thou
me
now
but
thou
canst
guess
i
judge
viewing
the
straw
what
once
was
in
the
ear
ah
i
have
borne
much
tribulation
heap
and
heavy
woes
courage
and
might
had
i
from
mars
and
pallas
at
what
time
i
drew
planning
some
dread
exploit
an
ambush
forth
of
our
most
valiant
chiefs
no
boding
fears
of
death
seized
but
foremost
far
of
all
i
sprang
to
fight
and
pierced
the
flying
foe
such
was
i
once
in
arms
but
household
toils
sustain
for
children
sake
and
carking
cares
t
enrich
a
family
were
not
for
me
my
pleasures
were
the
gallant
bark
the
din
of
battle
the
smooth
spear
and
shaft
objects
of
dread
to
others
but
which
me
the
gods
disposed
to
love
and
to
enjoy
thus
minds
are
amused
for
ere
achaia

sailed
to

nine
times
was
i
commander
of
an

embark
against
a
foreign
foe
and
found
in
all
those
enterprizes
great
success
from
the
whole
booty
first
what
pleased
me
most
chusing
and
sharing
also
much
by
lot
i
rapidly
grew
rich
and
had
thenceforth
among
the
cretans
and
respect
but
when
jove
that
voyage
dire
ordain
which
loos
the
knees
of
many
a
greek

to
idomeneus
and
me
they
gave
the
charge
of
all
their

which
how
to
avoid
we
found
not
so
importunate
the
cry
of
the
whole

us
to
the
task
there

nine
long
years
and
in

in

arrived
a

in

who
had

i
also
was
cajoled

gone
there
from
the

of

to
ask
counsel
divine
if
openly
to

after
long
absence
in
his
opulent
realm
of
ithaca
be
best
or
in

the

swore
in
his

pouring
libation
that
the

was
launch
and
the

ready
for

me
he
first
dismiss
for
as
it
chanced
a
ship
lay
there
of
the
thesprotians
bound
to
green
dulichium
isle
he
bade
the
crew
bear
me
to
king
acastus
with
all
speed
but
them
far
other
thoughts
pleased
more
and
thoughts
of
harm
to
me
that
i
might
yet
be
plunged
in
deeper
gulphs
of
woe
than
i
had
known
for
when
the
bark
had
left
the
land
remote
framing
combined
a
plot
against
my
liberty
they
stripp
my
vest
and
mantle
and
this
tatter
raiment
foul
gave
me
instead
which
thy
own
eyes
behold
at
reaching
the
cultur
coast
of
ithaca
they
left
me
bound
on
board
with
tackle
of
the
bark
and
quitting
ship
themselves
made
hasty
supper
on
the
shore
but
me
meantime
the
gods
easily
loos
by
their
own
when
with
wrapper
vile
around
my
brows
sliding
into
the
sea
at
the
ship
stern
i
lay
me
on
the
flood
with
both
hands
oaring
thence
my
course
i
swam
till
past
all
ken
of
theirs
then
landing
where
thick
covert
of
luxuriant
trees
i
mark
close
couchant
down
i
lay
they
loud
paced
to
and
fro
but
deeming
farther
search
unprofitable
soon
embark
again
thus
baffling
all
their
search
with
ease
the
gods
conceal
and
led
me
thence
to
the
abode
of
a
wise
man
dooming
me
still
to
live
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
alas
my
most
compassionable
guest
thou
hast
much
moved
me
by
this
tale
minute
of
thy
sad
and
thy
woes
but
speaking
of
ulysses
thou
hast
all
credence
i
at
least
can
give
thee
none
why
noble
as
thou
art
thou
invent
palpable
falsehoods
as
for
the
return
of
my
regretted
lord
myself
i
know
that
had
he
not
been
hated
by
the
gods
unanimous
he
had
in
battle
died
at
troy
or
that
long
doubtful
war
at
last
concluded
in
his
people
arms
at
home
then
universal
greece
had
raised
his
tomb
and
he
had
even
for
his
son
immortal
glory
but
alas
by
beaks
of
harpies
torn
unseemly
sight
he
lies
here
is
my
home
the
while
i
never
seek
the
city
unless
summon
by
discrete
penelope
to
listen
to
the
news
brought
by
some
stranger
arrived
then
all
alike
inquisitive
attend
both
who
regret
the
absence
of
our
king
and
who
rejoice
gratuitous
to
gorge
his
property
but
as
for
me
no
joy
find
i
in
after
such
reports
since
an
ætolian
cozen
me
who
found
after
long
over
various
lands
a
fugitive
for
blood
my
lone
retreat
him
warm
i
welcom
and
with
open
arms
receiv
who
bold
affirm
that
he
had
seen
my
master
with
idomeneus
at
crete
his
ships
refitting
shatter
by
a
storm
and
that
in
summer
with
his
godlike
band
he
would
return
bringing
great
riches
home
or
else
in
autumn
and
thou
ancient
guest
forlorn
since
thee
the
gods
have
hither
led
seek
not
to
gratify
me
with
untruths
and
to
deceive
me
since
for
no
such
cause
i
shall
respect
or
love
thee
but
alone
by
pity
influenced
and
the
fear
of
jove
to
whom
ulysses
replied
thou
hast
in
truth
a
most
incredulous
mind
whom
even
with
an
oath
i
have
not
moved
or
aught
persuaded
come
then
let
us
make
in
terms
express
a
and
the
gods
who
hold
olympus
witness
to
us
both
if
thy
own
lord
at
this
thy
house
arrive
thou
shalt
dismiss
me
decently
attired
in
vest
and
mantle
that
i
may
repair
hence
to
dulichium
whither
i
would
go
but
if
thy
lord
come
not
then
all
thy
servants
headlong
hurl
me
from
a
rock
that
other
mendicants
may
fear
to
lie
to
whom
the
generous
in
return
yes
stranger
doubtless
i
should
high
renown
obtain
for
virtue
among
men
both
now
and
in
all
future
times
if
having
first
invited
thee
and
at
my
board
regaled
i
next
should
slay
thee
then
my
would
mount
past
question
swiftly
to
saturnian
jove
but
the
hour
calls
to
supper
and
ere
long
the
partners
of
my
toils
will
come
prepared
to
spread
the
board
with
no
cheer
thus
they
conferr
and
now
the
swains
arrived
driving
their
charge
which
fast
they
soon
enclosed
within
their
customary
penns
and
loud
the
hubbub
was
of
swine
prison
within
then
call
the
master
to
his
rustic
train
bring
ye
the
best
that
we
may
set
him
forth
before
my
friend
from
foreign
climes
arrived
with
whom
ourselves
will
also
feast
who
find
the
multitude
a
painful
charge
while
others
at
no
cost
of
theirs
consume
day
after
day
the
profit
of
our
toils
so
saying
his
wood
for
fuel
he
prepared
and
dragging
thither
a
brawn
of
the
fifth
year
his
servants
held
him
fast
at
the
nor
failed
the
master
swain
t
adore
the
gods
for
wise
and
good
was
he
but
consecration
of
the
victim
first
himself
performing
cast
into
the
fire
the
forehead
bristles
of
the
tusky
boar
then
pray
to
all
above
that
safe
at
length
ulysses
might
regain
his
native
home
then
lifting
an
huge
shive
that
lay
beside
the
fire
he
smote
the
boar
and
dead
he
fell
next
piercing
him
and
scorching
close
his
hair
they
carv
him
quickly
and
eumæus
spread
thin
slices
crude
taken
from
limb
all
his
fat
then
other
slices
cast
sprinkling
them
first
with
meal
into
the
fire
the
rest
they
slash
and
scored
and
roasted
well
and
placed
it
heap
together
on
the
board
then
rose
the
good
eumæus
to
his
task
of
distribution
for
he
understood
the
hospitable
entertainer

of
the
banquet
made
he
gave
with
previous
to

to

of

whole
then
served
his
present
guests
honouring
first
ulysses
with
the
boar
perpetual
chine
by
that
distinction
just
his
master

he
gratified
and
thus
the
hero
spake
eumæus
be
thou
as
belov
of
jove
as
thou
art
dear
to
me
whom
though
attired
so
coarsely
thou
hast
served
with
such
respect
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
eat
noble
stranger
and
refreshment
take
such
as
thou
god
gives
and
god
denies
at
his
own
will
for
he
is
lord
of
all
he
said
and
to
the
everlasting
gods
the

sacrificed
of
all
then
made
libation
and
the
cup
placed
in
the

of
laertiades
sitting
beside
his

meantime
mesaulius

dispensed
to
all

in
the

eumæus
had
from
taphian
traders
bought
with
his

proper
goods
at
no
expence
either
to
old
laertes
or
the
queen
and
now

stretch
their

toward

before

when

then
fed
to
full
satiety
in
haste
each

a

night
and
jove
all

descended
fast
in
with
howlings
of
the

at

for

we
err

replied
and
doubtless
so
we

at

we
will
report

and
oh

to

and
thus

all
to

turn
now

chief
if
us
this
omen
or
thyself
regard
while
warlike
menelaus
musing
stood
what
answer
fit
to

helen
meantime
his

preventing
him
began
hear
me
for
i
will
answer
as
the

teach

as
i
think
shall
come
to

as
he
descending
from

sprang
through

they
shook
journeying
swift
and
now
the
setting
sun
to
gloomy
evening
had
resign
the
roads
when
they
to
pheræ
came
and
in
the

of

slept
their

they
in

plied
brisk

willing
flew

thus
whirl
along

telemachus
his

turning
to
his

thus
began
how

i
win
from
thee
not

only
but
performance
kind
of
my
request
we
are
not

alone
to

by
the

by

this

shall
unite
us
still
the
more

me
not
i
intreat
thee
noble

drop
me
at

detain
me
in
his

through
desire
to
feast
me
for
i
dread
the

delay
he
spake
then
mused
pisistratus
how
best
he
might
effect
the
wishes
of
his
friend
and
thus
at
length
resolved
turning
his
steeds
with
sudden
deviation
to
the
shore
he
sought
the
bark
and
placing
in
the
stern
both

in

so
saying
he
to

urged
his

at

telemachus
exhorted

alas
good
swain
eumæus
how
remote
from

wast
thou
forced
to
roam
in
thy
infancy

tell
me
true
the
city
where
thy
parents
dwelt
did
foes
pillage
it
or
did
else
some
hostile
band
surprizing
thee
alone
on

attendant
bear
thee
with
them
the

and
sell
thee
at
this

house
who
doubtless
for
no
sordid
price
or
small
to
whom
the

stranger
since
thou
art
curious
to
be
told
my

silent
listen

thy

at

quaff
the
nights
are
longest
now
and
such
as
time
for
sleep
afford
and
time
for
pleasant
neither
were
it
good
that
thou
to
thy
couch
before
thy
hour
since
even
sleep
is
hurtful
in
excess
whoever
here
is
weary
and
desires
early
repose
let
him
depart
to
rest
and
at
the
peep
of
day
when
he
hath
fed
sufficiently
drive
forth
my

but
we
with

supplied
will
solace
mutually
derive
from
recollection
of
our
sufferings
past
for
who
hath
much
endured
and
wander
far
finds
the
recital
of
sorrow
sweet
now
hear
thy
question
satisfied
attend
there
is
an
island
thou
hast
heard
perchance
of
such
an
isle
named
syria
it
is
placed
above
ortigia
and
a
dial
owns
true
to
the
tropic
changes
of
the

no

extent
she
boasts

is
she
rich
in
cattle
and
in

in

and

no

knows
that
people
or

noisome
of

a

and
laden
deep
with

who
was
she
he
enquired
and
whence
nor
she
scrupled
to
tell
at
once
her

home
i
am
of
sidon
famous
for
her
works
in
brass
and
steel
daughter
of
arybas
who
rolls
in
affluence
taphian
pirates
thence
stole
me
returning
from
the
field
from
whom
this
chief
procured
me
at
no
little
cost
then
answer
thus
her
paramour
return
wilt
thou
not
hence
to
sidon
in
our
ship
that
thou
once
more
visit
the
abode
of
thy
own
wealthy
parents
and
themselves
for
still
they
live
and
still
are
wealthy
deem
to
whom
the
woman
even
that
might
be
would
ye
ye
seamen
by
a
solemn
oath
assure
me
of
a
safe
conveyance
home
then
sware
the
mariners
as
she
required
and
when
their
oath
was
ended
thus
again
the
woman
of
phœnicia
them
bespake
now
silence
no
man
henceforth
of
you
all
accost
me
though
he
meet
me
on
the
road
or
at
yon
fountain
lest
some
tattler
run
with

home
to
my

who
with
suspicion
touch
may
confine
in
cruel
bonds
and

and
when
your

shall
be
freighted
full
quick
send
me
notice
for
i

to
bring
what
gold
soever
opportune
i

they
there

of

when

now

she
lay
for

prepared
their
messenger
arrived
to
summon
down
the
woman
to
the

a
mariner
of

subtle

shrewd
then
at
my

gate
produced
a
splendid
collar
gold
with

strung
my

then
at

with

with

proposed
to

it
and
he
the
nod
significant
gave
unobserv

to
the
phœnician
woman
and

she
thus
informed
leading
me
by

went
forth

in

the

bore
to

where
with

bought
me
by

it

that
i
saw
the

in
which
i
dwell
to

ulysses
glorious

replied
eumæus
thou

moved
me
much
thy

enumerating
thus
at

but
jove
hath
neighbour
all
thy

with
this

that
after

thou

i

thus
mutual
they
conferr
nor
leisure
found
save
for
short
sleep
by

soon
surprized
meantime
the

prepared
and
charged
their

when
neither

telemachus
began
push
ye
the

without

at

to

since
nought
should

thee
there
of

neither

another

thou
seek
eurymachus
the

all
the

here
reverence

all
is
he
and
seeks
more
ardent
than
his

far
to

my

to
fill
my

throne
but
he
who
dwells
above
jove
only
knows
if
some
disastrous
day
be

for
them
or
ere
those

shall

approach
obsequious
and
the
sound
of
feet
i
hear
scarce
had
he
ceased
when
his
own
son
himself
stood
in
the
vestibule
upsprang
at
once
eumæus
and
from
his
hand
let
fall
the
cups
with
which
he
was
mingling
rich
wine
to
his
young
lord
he
ran
his
forehead
kiss
kiss
his
eyes
and
both
his
hands
weeping
profuse
the
while
as
when
a
father
folds
in
his
embrace
arrived
from
foreign
lands
in
the
tenth
year
his
darling
son
the
offspring
of
his
age
his
only
one
for
whom
he
long
hath
mourn
so
kiss
the
noble
peasant
and
godlike
telemachus
as
from
death
escaped
and
in
wing
accents
plaintive
thus
began
light
of
my
eyes
thou
it
is
thyself
sweetest
telemachus
i
had
no
hope
to
see
thee
more
once
told
that
the
deep
thou
hadst
departed
for
the
pylian
coast
enter
my
precious
son
that
i
may
sooth
my
soul
with
sight
of
thee
from
far
arrived
for
seldom
thou
thy
feeders
and
thy
farm
visitest
in
the
city
custom
much
to
make
abode
that
thou
witness
there
the
manners
of
those
hungry
suitors
proud
to
whom
telemachus
discrete
replied
it
will
be
so
there
is
great
need
my
friend
but
here
for
thy
sake
have
i
now
arrived
that
i
may
look
on
thee
and
from
thy
lips
learn
if
my
mother
still
reside
at
home
or
have
become
spouse
of
some
other
chief
leaving
untenanted
ulysses
bed
to
be
by
noisome
spiders
webb
around
to
whom
the
master
in
return
not
so
she
patient
still
as
ever
dwells
beneath
thy
roof
but
all
her
cheerless
days
despairing
wastes
and
all
her
nights
in
tears
so
saying
eumæus
at
his
hand
received
his
brazen
lance
and
the
step
of
stone
enter
telemachus
to
whom
his
sire
relinquish
soon
as
he
appear
his
seat
but
him
telemachus
forbidding
said
guest
keep
thy
seat
our
cottage
will
afford
some
other
which
eumæus
will
provide
he
ceased
and
he
returning
at
the
word
reposed
again
then
good
eumæus
spread
green
twigs
beneath
which
cover
with
a
fleece
supplied
ulysses
offspring
with
a
seat
he
next
disposed
his
dishes
on
the
board
with
relicts
charged
of
yesterday
with
bread
alert
he
heap
the
baskets
with
rich
wine
his
ivy
cup
replenish
and
a
seat
took
opposite
to
his
illustrious
lord
ulysses
they
toward
the
plenteous
feast
stretch
forth
their
hands
and
hunger
now
and
thirst
both
satisfied
telemachus
his
speech
addressing
to
their
host
began
whence
is
this
guest
my
father
how
came
he
to
ithaca
what
country
boast
the
mariners
with
whom
he
here
arrived
for
that
on
foot
he
found
us
not
is
sure
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
i
will
with
truth
answer
thee
o
my
son
he
boasts
him
sprung
from
ancestry
in
spacious
crete
and
hath
the
cities
seen
of
various
lands
by
fate
ordain
to
roam
now
from
a
thesprotian
ship
escaped
he
reach
my
cottage
but
he
is
thy
own
i
yield
him
to
thee
treat
him
as
thou
wilt
he
is
thy
suppliant
and
depends
on
thee
then
thus
telemachus
discrete
replied
thy
words
eumæus
pain
my
very
soul
for
what
security
can
i
afford
to
any
in
my
house
myself
am
young
nor
yet
of
strength
sufficient
to
repel
an
offer
insult
and
my
mother
mind
in
doubtful
balance
hangs
if
still
with
me
an
inmate
she
shall
manage
my
concerns
attentive
only
to
her
absent
lord
and
her
own
good
report
or
shall
espouse
the
noblest
of
her
wooers
and
the
best
entitled
by
the
splendour
of
his
gifts
but
i
will
give
him
since
i
find
him
a
guest
beneath
thy
roof
tunic
and
cloak
sword
and
sandals
for
his
feet
with
convoy
to
the
country
of
his
choice
still
if
it
please
thee
keep
him
here
thy
guest
and
i
will
send
him
raiment
with
supplies
of
all
sorts
lest
he
burthen
thee
and
thine
but
where
the
suitors
come
there
shall
not
he
with
my
consent
nor
stand
exposed
to
pride
and
petulance
like
theirs
lest
by
some
sneer
they
wound
him
and
through
him
wound
also
me
for
little
is
it
that
the
boldest
can
against
so
many
numbers
will
prevail
him
answer
then
ulysses
oh
amiable
and
good
since
even
i
am
free
to
answer
thee
i
will
avow
my
heart
within
me
torn
by
what
i
hear
of
those
injurious
suitors
who
the
house
infest
of
one
noble
as
thou
but
say
submittest
thou
to
their
controul
willingly
or
because
the
people
by
some
response
oracular
incline
against
thee
thou
hast
brothers
it
may
chance
slow
to
assist
thee
for
a
brother
aid
is
of
importance
in
whatever
cause
for
oh
that
i
had
youth
as
i
have
will
or
that
renown
ulysses
were
my
sire
or
that
himself
might
wander
home
again
whereof
hope
yet
remains
then
might
i
lose
my
head
that
moment
by
an
alien
hand
if
i
would
fail
ulysses
gate
to
be
the
bane
and
mischief
of
them
all
but
if
alone
to
multitudes
opposed
i
should
perchance
be
foiled
nobler
it
were
with
my
own
people
under
my
own
roof
to
perish
than
to
witness
evermore
their
unexampled
deeds
guests
shoved
aside
maidens
dragg
forcibly
from
room
to
room
casks
emptied
of
their
rich
contents
and
them
indulging
appetite
day
by
day
enormous
without
measure
without
end
to
whom
telemachus
discrete
replied
stranger
thy
questions
shall
from
me
receive
true
answer
enmity
or
hatred
none
subsists
the
people
and
myself
between
nor
have
i
brothers
to
accuse
whose
aid
is
of
importance
in
whatever
cause
for
jove
hath
from
of
old
with
single
heirs
our
house
supplied
arcesias
none
begat
except
laertes
and
laertes
none
except
ulysses
and
ulysses
me
left
here
his
only
one

comes
it
that
our

swarms
with
foes
for
all
the

the
zacynthus

here
in

in
marriage
and
my
household
stores
consume
but
neither
she
those
nuptial
rites
refuses
absolute
nor
yet
consents
to
end
them
they
my
patrimony
waste
meantime
and
will
destroy
me
also
soon
as
i
expect
but
disposes
all

my
father

with
speed
news
to
penelope
that
i
am
safe
and
have
arrived
from
pylus
i
will
wait
till
thou
return
and
well
beware
that
none
hear
thee
beside
for
i
have
many
foes
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
it
is
enough
i
understand
thou
to
one
intelligent
but
say
beside
shall
i
not
also
as
i
go
inform
distress
laertes
who
while
yet
he
ulysses
only
could
the
works
and
dieted
among
his
menials
oft
as
hunger
prompted
him
but
now
they
say
since
thy
departure
to
the
pylian
shore
he
neither
eats
as
he
was
wont
nor
drinks
nor
oversees
his
hinds
but
sighing
sits
and
weeping
wasted
even
to
the
bone
him
then
telemachus
answer
discrete
hard
though
it

to
his

and
sighs
him
leave

now
we
can
not

were
the
ordering
of
all

to
our

our

desire
should
be
to
see
my
father
glad
return
but
once
thy
tidings
told
wander
not
thou
in

of
him
but
hither
speed
again
rather
request
my

that
she

without

privately
to

she
shall

inform
the

and

him
forth
who

from

not
unsuspicious
of

in

accents
eager
thus
began
thou

no

whom
i
lately

nor
are
thy

nor

thy

the

thou
art
a

we
may
yield
thee
rites
acceptable
and
present
thee
golden

ah
spare
us
divine
to
whom
ulysses
hero
i
am
no
god
why
thou
me
divine
i
am
thy
father
for
whose
sake
thou
a
life
of
woe
by
violence
oppress
so
saying
he
kiss
his
son
while
from
his
cheeks
tears
trickled
tears
till
then
perforce
restrained
telemachus
for
he
believed
him
not
his
father
yet
thus
spake
again
my
father
thou
no
thou
art
not
he
but
some
divinity
beguiles
my
soul
with
to
afflict
me
still
the
more
for
never
mortal
man
could
so
have
wrought
by
his
own
some
interposing
god
alone
could
render
thee
both
young
and
old
for
old
thou
wast
of
late
and
foully
clad
but
the
semblance
now
of
those
in
to
whom
ulysses
replied
telemachus
it
is
not
well
my
son
that
thou
greet
thy
father
with
a
face
of
wild
astonishment
and
stand
aghast
ulysses
save
myself
none
comes
be
sure
such
as
thou
seest
after
ten
thousand
woes
which
i
have
borne
i
visit
once
again
my
native
country
in
the
twentieth
year
this
wonder
athenæan
pallas
wrought
she
cloath
me
even
with
what
form
she
would
for
so
she
can
now
poor
i
seem
and
old
now
young
again
and
clad
in
fresh
attire
the
gods
who
dwell
in
yonder
with
ease
dignify
or
debase
a
mortal
man
so
saying
he
sat
then
threw
telemachus
his
arms
around
his
father
neck
and
wept
desire
intense
of
lamentation
seized
on
both
soft
murmurs
each
indulged
his
grief
more
frequent
wailing
than
the
bird
eagle
or
vulture
from
whose
nest
some
swain
hath
her
yet
unfeather
young
so
from
their
eyelids
they
big
drops
of
grief
nor
had
the
setting
sun
cessation
of
their
weeping
seen
had
not
telemachus
his
father
thus
address
what
ship
convey
thee
to
thy
native
shore
my
father
and
what
country
boast
the
crew
for
that
on
foot
thou
not
is
sure
then
thus
divine
ulysses
my
son
i
will
explicit
all
relate
conducted
by
phæacia
maritime
sons
i
came
a
race
accustom
to
convey
strangers
who
visit
them
across
the
deep
me
the
billows
in
a
rapid
bark
borne
sleeping
on
the
shores
of
ithaca
they
lay
rich
gifts
they
gave
me
also
brass
gold
in
full
bags
and
beautiful
attire
which
warn
from
i
have
in
caves
conceal
by
pallas
prompted
hither
i
that
we
might
plan
the
slaughter
of
our
foes
whose
numbers
tell
me
now
that
i
may
know
how
certainly
and
who
they
are
and
consultation
with
my
dauntless
heart
may
hold
if
we
be
able
to
contend
ourselves
with
all
or
must
have
aid
beside
then
answer
thus
his
son
discrete
return
my
father
thy
renown
hath
ever
rung
in
thy
son
ears
and
by
report
thy
force
in
arms
and
wisdom
i
have
oft
been
told
but
terribly
thou
i
hear
can
two
a
multitude
oppose
and
valiant
warriors
all
for
neither
ten
are
they
nor
twenty
but
more
far
learn
now
their
numbers
fifty
youths
and
two
came
from
dulichium
they
are
chosen
men
and
six
attendants
follow
in
their
train
from
samos
twenty
youths
and
four
arrive
zacynthus
also
of
achaia
sons
sends
twenty
more
and
our
own
island
adds
herself
her
twelve
chief
rulers
medon
too
is
there
the
herald
and
the
bard
divine
with
other
two
intendants
of
the
board
should
we
within
the
palace
we
alone
assail
them
all
i
fear
lest
thy
revenge
unpleasant
to
thyself
and
deadly
prove
frustrating
thy
return
but
recollect
think
if
thou
canst
on
whose
arm
strenuous
on
our
behalf
we
may
rely
to
him
replied
his
patient
father
bold
i
will
inform
thee
mark
weigh
well
my
words
will
pallas
and
the
everlasting
sire
alone
suffice
or
need
we
other
aids
then
answer
thus
telemachus
return
good
friends
indeed
are
they
whom
thou
hast
named
though
throned
above
the
clouds
for
their
controul
is
universal
both
in
earth
and
to
whom
ulysses
chief
renown
not
long
will
they
from
battle
stand
aloof
when
once
within
my
palace
in
the
strength
of
mars
to
sharp
decision
we
shall
urge
the
suitors
but
thyself
at
early
dawn
our
mansion
seek
that
thou
mingle
there
with
that
imperious
throng
me
in
due
time
eumæus
to
the
city
shall
conduct
in
form
a
miserable
beggar
old
but
should
they
with
dishonourable
scorn
insult
me
thou
unmov
my
wrongs
endure
and
should
they
even
drag
me
by
the
feet
abroad
or
smite
me
with
the
spear
thy
wrath
refraining
gently
counsel
them
to
cease
from
such
extravagance
but
well
i
know
that
cease
they
will
not
for
their
hour
is
come
and
mark
me
well
treasure
what
now
i
say
deep
in
thy
soul
when
pallas
shall
herself
suggest
the
measure
then
shaking
my
brows
i
will
admonish
thee
thou
at
the
sign
remove
what
arms
soever
in
the
hall
remain
and
in
the
upper
palace
safe
dispose
them
should
the
suitors
missing
them
perchance
interrogate
thee
then
reply
gently
i
have
removed
them
from
the
smoke
for
they
appear
no
more
the
arms
which
erst
ulysses
going
hence
to
ilium
left
but
smirch
and
sullied
by
the
breath
of
fire
this
weightier
reason
thou
shalt
also
say
jove
taught
me
lest
intoxicate
with
wine
ye
should
assault
each
other
in
your
brawls
shaming
both
feast
and
courtship
for
the
view
itself
of
arms
incites
to
their
abuse
yet
leave
two
faulchions
for
ourselves
alone
two
spears
two
bucklers
which
with
sudden
force
impetuous
we
will
seize
and
jove
their
valour
shall
and
pallas
steal
away
this
word
store
also
in
remembrance
deep
if
mine
in
truth
thou
art
and
of
my
blood
then
of
ulysses
to
his
home
returned
let
none
hear
news
from
thee
no
not
my
sire
laertes
nor
eumæus
nor
of
all
the
menials
any
or
penelope
that
thou
and
i
alone
may
search
the
drift
of
our
domestic
women
and
may
prove
our
who
honours
and
reveres
and
who
contemns
us
both
but
chiefly
thee
so
gracious
and
so
worthy
to
be
loved
him
then
thus
answer
his
illustrious
son
trust
me
my
father
thou
shalt
soon
be
taught
that
i
am
not
of
drowsy
mind
obtuse
but
this
i
think
not
likely
to
avail
or
thee
or
me
ponder
it
yet
again
for
tedious
were
the
task
farm
after
farm
to
visit
of
those
servants
proving
each
and
the
proud
suitors
merciless
devour
meantime
thy
substance
nor
abstain
from
aught
learn
if
thou
wilt
and
i
that
course
myself
advise
who
slights
thee
of
the
female
train
and
who
is
guiltless
but
i
would
not
try
from
house
to
house
the
men
far
better
proved
hereafter
if
in
truth
by
signs
from
inform
thou
hast
been
taught
the
will
of
jove
thus
they
conferr
the
gallant
bark
meantime
reach
ithaca
which
from
the
pylian
shore
had
brought
telemachus
with

they
an

charg
with
tidings
to

that
her
telemachus
had
reach
the
cot
of
good
eumæus
and
the
bark
had
sent
home
to
the

lest
the
matchless

should
still
deplore
the

they
then
the

bearing

at

told
his

also
from
her

and
his

punctually
discharged
leaving

sought
his

again
grief
seized
and
anguish
at
those
tidings
all
the
suitors
issuing
forth
on
the
outside
of
the
high
wall
they
sat
before
the
gate
when
polybus
son
eurymachus
began
my
friends
his
arduous
task
this
voyage
by
us
impossible
in
our
despight
telemachus
hath
atchieved
haste
launch
we
forth
a
sable
bark
our
best
which
let
us
man
with
mariners
expert
who
rowing
forth
swiftly
shall
summon
our
companions
home
scarce
had
he
said
when
turning
where
he
sat
amphinomus
beheld
a
bark
arrived
just
then
in
port
he
saw
them
furling
sail
and
seated
with
their
oars
in
hand
he
through
pleasure
at
that
sight
and
thus
he
spake
our
message
may
be
spared
lo
they
arrive
either
some
god
inform
them
or
they
saw
themselves
the
vessel
of
telemachus
too
swiftly
passing
to
be
reach
by
theirs
he
spake
they
rising
hasted
to
the
shore
alert
they
drew
the
sable
bark
aground
and
by
his
servant
each
his
arms
to
his
own
home
then
all
to
council
those
assembling
neither
elder
of
the
land
nor
youth
allow
to
join
them
and
the
rest
eupithes
son
antinoüs
thus
bespake
ah
how
the
gods
have
rescued
him
all
day
perch
on
the
airy
our
spies
successive
watch
and
when
the
sun
declined
we
never
slept
on
shore
but
all
night
long
till
sacred
dawn
arose
plow
the
abyss
hoping
telemachus
that
we
might
seize
and
slay
him
whom
some
deity
hath
led
in
our
despight
safe
to
his
home
again
but
frame
we
yet
again
means
to
destroy
telemachus
ah
let
not
him
escape
for
end
of
this
our
task
while
he
survives
none
shall
be
found
such
prudence
he
displays
and
wisdom
neither
are
the
people
now
unanimous
our
friends
as
heretofore
come
then
prevent
him
ere
he
call
the
greeks
to
council
for
he
will
not
long
delay
but
will
be
angry
doubtless
and
will
tell
amid
them
all
how
we
in
vain
devised
his
death
a
deed
which
they
will
scarce
applaud
but
will
perhaps
punish
and
drive
us
forth
from
our
own
country
to
a
distant
prevent
him
therefore
quickly
in
the
field
slay
him
or
on
the
road
so
shall
his
wealth
and
his
possessions
on
ourselves
devolve
which
we
will
share
equally
but
his
house
shall
be
the
queen
and
his
whom
she
shall
wed
yet
if
not
so
inclined
ye
rather
chuse
that
he
should
live
and
occupy
entire
his
patrimony
then
no
longer
here
assembled
let
us
revel
at
his
cost
but
let
us
all
with
spousal
gifts
produced
from
our
respective
treasures
woo
the
queen
leaving
her
in
full
freedom
to
espouse
who
proffers
most
and
whom
the
fates
ordain
he
ceased
the
assembly
silent
sat
and
mute
then
rose
amphinomus
amid
them
all
offspring
renown
of
nisus
son
himself
of
king
aretias
he
had
thither
led
the
suitor
train
who
from
the
pleasant
isle
of
green
dulichium
had
arrived
and
by
his
speech
pleased
far
beyond
them
all
penelope
for
he
was
just
and
wise
and
thus
the
rest
began
not
i
my
friends
far
be
the
thought
from
me
to
slay
telemachus
it
were
a
deed
momentous
terrible
to
slay
a
prince
first
therefore
let
us
counsel
ask
of
and
if
jove
oracle
that
course
approve
i
will
encourage
you
and
will
myself
be
active
in
his
death
but
if
the
gods
forbid
it
then
by
my
advice
forbear
so
spake
amphinomus
whom
all
approved
arising
then
into
ulysses
house
they
went
where
each
his
splendid
seat
resumed
a
novel
purpose
occupied
meantime
penelope

purposed
to
appear
before
her
suitors
whose
design
to
slay
telemachus
she
had
from
medon
learn
the
herald
for
his
ear
had
caught
the
sound
toward
the
hall
with
her
attendant
train
she
moved
and
when
most
graceful
of
her
sex
where
sat
the

she
arrived
between
the
columns
standing
of
the
stately
dome
and
covering
with
her
white
veil
lucid
folds
her
features
to
antinoüs
thus
she
spake
antinoüs
proud
contentious
evermore
to
mischief
prone
the
people
deem
thee
wise
past
thy
compeers
and
in
all
grace
of

but
such
wast
never
thou
inhuman
why
is
it
thy
dark
design
to
slay
telemachus
and
why
with
scorn
rejectest
thou
the
suppliant
which
jove
himself
hath

please
not
the

not
that
thy

found
here
when
he
fled

they
would
have
torn
his

and
would
have
laid
all

waste
but
my
ulysses
slaked
the
furious
heat
of
their
revenge
whom
thou
requitest
now
wasting
his

soliciting
his

he
ended
and
telemachus
in
haste
set
forth
his
thoughts
all
teeming
as
he
went
with
dire
revenge
soon
in
the
arriving
he
reclined
his
spear
against
a
column
and
proceeded
to
the
hall
him
euryclea
first
his
nurse
perceived
while
on
the
variegated

she
spread
their
fleecy
swift
with
tearful

she
flew
to
him
and
the
whole
female
train
of
brave
ulysses
swarm
around
his
son
clasping
him
and
his
forehead
and
his

kissing
affectionate
then
came
herself
as

fair
forth
from

to

embrace
the

obtain

seeking

unfold
declare
what
thou

seen
to

telemachus
discrete
replied
ah

let
my

rest

me
from

so
lately
afflict
anew
but
bathed

habited
in

with
all
the

of
thy

ascend
to
thy
superior
chamber
there
to
vow
a
perfect

to
all
the

shall
have
avenged
our

i
seek
the
forum
there
to
introduce
a
guest
my

from
the
pylian
shore
whom
sending
forward
with

entertain

a

divine
and

gazed
on
him
as

him
round
joy
on

and
welcome
but
deep
mischief
in
their
hearts
he
shunning
all
that

chose

much
enquired
then
drew

toward

nor
telemachus
stood
long
aloof
but
greeted
his
approach
and
was
accosted
by
piræus
thus
sir
send
thy

to
bring
home
the
precious
charge
committed
to
my
care
thy
gifts
at
menelaus
hands
received
to
whom
telemachus
discrete
replied
piræus
wait
for
i
not
yet
foresee
the
upshot
should
these
haughty
ones
effect
my
death
clandestine
under
my
own
roof
and
parcel
my
inheritance
by
lot
i
rather
wish
those
treasures
thine
than
theirs
but
should
i
with
success
plan
for
them
all
a
bloody
death
then
wing
with
joy
thyself
bring
home
those
presents
to
thy
joyful
friend
so
saying

led
the

stranger
thence
into

cast
his

ascend
again
and
will
repose
me
on

bed
for
such
it
hath
been

with

ceaseless
bedew

of

thou

then
telemachus
discrete

at

i
will
with
truth
relate
the
whole
at
pylus

arrived
we
nestor
found
chief
of
the
pylian
race
receiving
me
in
his
august
abode

entertain
me
with
such
welcome
kind
as
a
glad
father
shews
to
his
own
son
and
newly
found
so
nestor
me
and
his
illustrious
offspring
entertain
but
yet
assured
me
that
he
nought
had
heard
from
mortal
lips
of
my
magnanimous
sire
whether
alive
or
dead
with
his
own
steeds
he
sent
me
and
with
splendid
chariot
thence
to
menelaus
atreus
son
there
saw
i
helen
by
the
gods
decree
of
trouble
both
to
greece
and
troy
the
hero
menelaus
then
enquired
what
cause
had
urged
me
to
the
pleasant
vale
of
lacedæmon
plainly
i
rehearsed
the
occasion
and
the
hero
thus
replied
ye
gods
they
are
ambitious
of
the
bed
of
a
brave
man
however
base
themselves
but
as
it
chances
when
the
hart
hath
laid
her
fawns
and
sucklings
yet
to
rest
in
some
resistless
lion
den
she
roams
meantime
the
hills
and
in
the
grassy
vales
feeds
heedless
but
the
lion
to
his
lair
returning
soon
both
her
and
hers
destroys
so
shall
thy
father
brave
ulysses
them
jove
pallas
and
apollo
oh
that
such
as
erst
in
lesbos
where
he
strove
with
philomelides
whom
wrestling
flat
he
threw
when
all
achaia
sons
rejoiced
ulysses
now
might
mingle
with
his
foes
short
life
and
bitter
nuptials
should
be
theirs
but
thy
enquiries
neither
indirect
will
i
evade
nor
give
thee
false
reply
but
all
that
from
the
ancient
of
the
deep
i
have
received
will
utter
hiding
nought

thus
they

the

hurl
the

and

on
the
smooth
area
spread
before

the

when

hour
of

now
approach
and
from

on

the

came
with

young

now
the

prepare

our

there

each

then
brisk
to

they
slew

the

nor
with

dispatch
ulysses
and
eumæus
now
prepared
to
seek
the
town
when
thus
the
swain
began
my
guest
since
thy
fixt
purpose
is
to
seek
this
day
the
city
as
my
master
bade
though
i
in
truth
much
rather
wish
thee
here
a
keeper
of
our
herds
yet
through
respect
and
of
his
orders
whose
reproof
i
dread
for
masters
seldom
gently
chide
i
would
be
gone
arise
let
us
depart
for
day
already
is
and
soon
the
air
of
will
chill
thee
more
to
whom
ulysses
replied
it
is
enough
i
understand
thou
to
one
intelligent
let
us
depart
and
lead
thyself
the
way
but
give
me
first
if
thou
have
one
already
hewn
a
staff
to
lean
on
for
ye
have
described
the
road
rugged
and
ofttimes
to
the
foot
so
saying
his
tatter
wallet
his
back
he
cast
suspended
by
a
leathern
twist
eumæus
gratified
him
with
a
staff
and
forth
they
went
leaving
the
cottage
kept
by
dogs
and
swains
he
his
king
led
on
in
form
a
squalid
beggar
old
halting
and
in
unseemly
garb
attired
but
when
the
craggy
way
they
now
approach
the
town
and
had
the
marble
fountain
deep
which
with
its
streams
pellucid
all
the
citizens
supplied
ithacus
had
that
fountain
framed
of
old
with
neritus
and
polyctor
over
which
a
grove
of
alders
hung
circular
on
all
sides
while
cold
the
rill
ran
from
the
rock
on
whose
tall
summit
stood
the
altar
of
the
nymphs
by
all
who
with
sacrifice
frequented
still
and
melantheus
son
of
dolius
at
that
fount
met
them
the
chosen
goats
of
flock
with
two
assistants
from
the
field
he
drove
the
suitors
supper
he
seeing
them
both
in
surly
accent
boorish
such
as
fired
ulysses
with
resentment
thus
began
ay
this
is
well
the
villain
leads
the
vile
thus
evermore
the
gods
join
like
to
like
thou
clumsy
whither
conduct
this
mendicant
obscene
defiler
base
of
banquets
many
a
post
shall
he
rub
smooth
that
props
him
while
he
begs
lean
alms
sole
object
of
his
low
pursuit
who
to
sword
or
tripod
yet
aspired
thou
afford
him
to
me
for
a
guard
or
sweeper
of
my
stalls
or
to
supply
my
kids
with
leaves
he
should
on
bulkier
thewes
supported
stand
though
nourish
but
with
whey
but
no
such
useful
arts
hath
he
acquired
nor
likes
he
work
but
rather
much
to
extort
from
others
food
for
his
unsated
maw
but
mark
my
prophecy
for
it
is
true
at
famed
ulysses
house
should
he
arrive
his
sides
shall
shatter
many
a
footstool
against
them
by
the
offended
princes
there
he
spake
and
drawing
nigh
with
his
rais
foot
insolent
as
he
was
and
brutish
smote
ulysses
haunch
yet
shook
not
from
his
path
the
chief
who
doubtful
mused
awhile
whether
to
rush
on
him
and
with
his
staff
to
slay
him
or
uplifting
him
on
high
downward
to
dash
him
headlong
but
his
wrath
restraining
calm
he
suffer
the
affront
him
then
eumæus
with
indignant
look
rebuking
rais
his
hands
and
fervent
pray
nymphs
of
the
fountains
progeny
of
jove
if
ulysses
on
your
altar
the
thighs
of
fatted
lambs
or
kidlings
grant
this
my
request
o
let
the
hero
soon
conducted
by
some
deity
return
so
shall
he
quell
that
arrogance
which
safe
thou
now
indulgest
roaming
day
by
day
the
city
while
bad
shepherds
mar
the
flocks
to
whom
the
answer
thus
melantheus
marvellous
how
rare
a
speech
the
subtle
cur
hath
framed
whom
i
will
send
far
hence
at
a
convenient
time
on
board
my
bark
and
sell
him
at
no
little
gain
i
would
that
he
who
bears
the
silver
bow
as
sure
might
pierce
telemachus
this
day
in
his
own
house
or
that
the
suitors
might
as
that
same
shall
return
no
more
he
said
and
them
left
pacing
slow
along
but
soon
himself
at
his
lord
house
arrived
there
bold
he
with
the
suitors
sat
opposite
to
eurymachus
for
him
he
valued
most
the
sewers
his
portion
placed
of
meat
before
him
and
the
maiden
chief
directress
of
the
household
gave
him
bread
and
now
ulysses
with
the
swain
his
friend
approach
when
hearing
the
harmonious
lyre
both
stood
for
phemius
had
begun
his
song
he
grasp
the
hand
and
thus
he
said
this
house
eumæus
of
ulysses
seems
passing
magnificent
and
to
be
known
with
ease
for
his
among
a
thousand
more
one
pile
supports
another
and
a
wall
crested
with
battlements
surrounds
the
court
firm
too
the
folding
doors
all
force
of
man
defy
but
guests
as
i
perceive
now
feast
within
witness
the
steam
upward
and
the
sounding
harp
divine
associate
of
the
festive
board
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
thou
hast
no
wonder
thou
art
quick
on
theme
but
let
us
well
forecast
this
business
wilt
thou
first
thyself
the
splendid
mansion
with
the
suitors
mix
me
leaving
here
or
shall
i
lead
the
way
while
thou
behind
yet
linger
not
lest
seeing
thee
without
some
servant
strike
or
drive
thee
hence
consider
which
were
best
him
answer
then
the
patient
hero
bold
it
is
enough
i
understand
thou
to
one
intelligent
lead
thou
the
way
me
leaving
here
for
neither
stripes
nor
blows
to
me
are
strange
much
exercised
with
pain
in
fight
and
on
the
deep
i
have
long
since
learn
patience
follow
next
what
follow
may
but
to
suppress
the
appetite
i
deem
impossible
the
stomach
is
a
source
of
ills
to
man
an
avaricious
gulph
destructive
which
to
satiate
ships
are
rigg
seas
travers
and
fierce
battles
waged
remote
thus
they
discoursing
stood
argus
the
while
ulysses
dog
uplifted
where
he
lay
his
head
and
ears
erect
ulysses
him
had
bred
long
since
himself
but
rarely
used
departing
first
to
ilium
him
the
youths
in
other
days
led
frequent
to
the
chace
of
wild
goat
hart
and
hare
but
now
he
a
poor
old
of
his
lord
forlorn
where
mules
and
oxen
had
before
the
gate
much
ordure
left
with
which
ulysses
hinds
should
in
due
time
manure
his
spacious
fields
there
lay
with
vermin
foul
all
over
argus
soon
as
he
perceived
ulysses
nigh
down
fell
his
ears
clapp
close
and
with
his
tail
glad
sign
he
gave
of
gratulation
impotent
to
rise
and
to
approach
his
master
as
of
old
ulysses
noting
him
wiped
off
a
tear
unmark
and
of
eumæus
quick
enquired
i
can
but
wonder
seeing
such
a
dog
thus
lodg
eumæus
beautiful
in
form
he
is
past
doubt
but
whether
he
hath
been
as
fleet
as
fair
i
know
not
rather
such
perchance
as
masters
sometimes
keep
to
grace
their
tables
nourish
more
for
shew
than
use
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
he
is
the
dog
of
one
dead
far
remote
but
had
he
now
such
strength
as
when
ulysses
left
him
going
hence
to
ilium
in
one
moment
thou
shouldst
mark
astonish
his
agility
and
force
he
never
in
the
sylvan
deep
recess
the
wild
beast
saw
that
him
and
he
their
steps
infallible
but
he
hath
now
no
comfort
for
the
master
dead
afar
the
heedless
servants
care
not
for
his
dog
domestics
missing
once
their
lord
controul
grow
wilful
and
refuse
their
proper
tasks
for
whom
jove
dooms
to
servitude
he
takes
at
once
the
half
of
that
man
worth
away
he
said
and
at
the
portal
the
suitors
then
his
destiny
released
old
argus
soon
as
he
had
lived
to
see
ulysses
in
the
twentieth
year
restored
godlike
telemachus
long
ere
the
rest
marking
the
entrance
with
a
nod
summon
him
to
approach
eumæus
cast
his
eye
around
and
seeing
vacant
there
the
seat
which
the
dispenser
of
the
feast
was
wont
to
occupy
while
he
supplied
the
guests
planted
it
right
before
telemachus
and
at
his
table
sat
on
which
the
herald
placed
for
him
his
share
of
meat
and
from
the
baskets
gave
him
bread
soon
after
ulysses
enter
slow
the
palace
like
a
squalid
beggar
old
and
in
loose
tatters
foul
attired
within
the
portal
on
the
ashen
sill
he
sat
and
seeming
languid
lean
against
a
cypress
pillar
by
the
builder
art
polish
long
since
and
planted
at
the
door
then
took
telemachus
a
loaf
entire
forth
from
the
elegant
basket
and
of
flesh
a
portion
large
as
his
two
hands
contained
and
close
the
charged
him
thus
these
to
the
stranger
whom
advise
to
ask
some
dole
from
suitor
bashful
fear
ill
suits
the
mendicant
by
want
oppress
he
spake
eumæus
went
and
where
he
sat
arriving
in
wing
accents
thus
began
telemachus
oh
stranger
sends
thee
these
and
counsels
thee
to
importune
for
more
the
suitors
one
by
one
for
bashful
fear
ill
suits
the
mendicant
by
want
oppress
to
whom
ulysses
replied
jove
king
of
all
grant
good
on
earth
to
kind
telemachus
and
the
complete
accomplishment
of
all
that
he
desires
he
said
and
with
both
hands
outspread
the
mess
receiving
as
he
sat
on
his
worn
bag
disposed
it
at
his
feet
long
as
the
bard
chaunted
he
ate
and
when
he
ceas
to
eat
then
also
ceas
the
bard
divine
to
sing
and
now
ensued
loud
clamour
in
the
hall
and
tumult
when
minerva
drawing
nigh
to
laertiades
impell
the
chief
crusts
to
collect
or
any
pittance
small
at
suitor
hand
for
trial
sake
of
just
and
unjust
yet
none
from
evil
she
design
for
any
there
from
left
to
right
his
progress
he
began
petitioning
with
outstretch
hands
the
throng
as
one
familiar
with
the
beggar
art
they
pitying
gave
to
him
but
view
him
still
with
wonder
and
enquiries
mutual
made
who
and
whence
was
he
then
the
rose
melanthius
and
th
assembly
thus
address
hear
me
ye
suitors
of
th
illustrious
queen
this
guest
of
whom
ye
ask
i
have
beheld
elsewhere
the
brought
him
but
himself
i
know
not
neither
who
nor
whence
he
is
so
he
then
thus
antinoüs
stern
rebuked
the
ah
notorious
as
thou
art
why
hast
thou
shewn
this
vagabond
the
way
into
the
city
are
we
not
enough
infested
with
these
troublers
of
our
feasts
it
a
trifle
that
such
numbers
eat
at
thy
lord
cost
and
hast
thou
therefore
led
this
fellow
hither
found
we
know
not
where
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
antinoüs
though
of
high
degree
thou
not
wisely
what
man
to
another
house
repairs
to
invite
him
to
a
feast
unless
he
be
of
those
who
by
profession
serve
the
public
prophet
healer
of
disease
ingenious
artist
or
some
bard
divine
whose
music
may
exhilarate
the
guests
these
and
such
only
are
in
land
call
to
the
banquet
none
invites
the
poor
who
much
consume
and
no
requital
yield
but
thou
of
all
the
suitors
roughly
ulysses
servants
most
and
chiefly
me
yet
thee
i
heed
not
while
the
virtuous
queen
dwells
in
this
palace
and
her
godlike
son
to
whom
telemachus
discrete
replied
peace
answer
not
verbose
a
man
like
him
antinoüs
hath
a
tongue
accustom
much
to
tauntings
and
promotes
them
in
the
rest
then
turning
to
antinoüs
quick
he
said
antinoüs
as
a
father
for
his
son
takes
thought
so
thou
for
me
who
me
chase
the
stranger
harshly
hence
but
god
forbid
impart
to
him
i
grudge
not
but
myself
exhort
thee
to
it
neither
in
this
cause
fear
thou
the
queen
or
in
the
least
regard
whatever
menial
throughout
all
the
house
of
famed
ulysses
ah
within
thy
breast
dwells
no
such
thought
thou
not
to
impart
to
others
but
to
gratify
thyself
to
whom
antinoüs
answer
thus
return
and
in
thy
speech
how
hast
thou
said
telemachus
would
all
as
much
bestow
on
him
he
should
not
seek
admittance
here
again
three
months
to
come
so
saying
he
seized
the
stool
which
banqueting
he
press
with
his
nice
feet
and
from
beneath
the
table
forth
advanced
it
into
view
the
rest
all
gave
to
him
with
bread
and
flesh
filling
his
wallet
and
ulysses
now
returning
to
his
threshold
there
to
taste
the
bounty
of
the
greeks
paused
in
his
way
beside
antinoüs

he
thus

me
for
thou
not

but
greatest
of
the
achaians

me
in

on

of

smote
him
firm
as

he
stood
by
no
such
force
to
be
displaced
but
silent
shook
his
brows
and
dreadful
deeds
of

ruminating
sought
again
his

his

he
grounded

the

he
ceased
whom
all
indignant
heard
and
thus
his

proud
companions
censured
him
antinoüs
thou
didst
not

for

he
little
cared
but
in
his

telemachus
that
blow
resented
yet
not
a
tear
he
shed
but
silent
shook
his
brows
and
mused
terrible
things
penelope
meantime
told
of
the
so
abused
beneath
her
roof
among
her
maidens
thus
exclaim
so
may

they
are
odious
all
for

alike
all
teem
with

but
antinoüs
looks
remind
me
ever
of
the
gloom
of
death
a
stranger
hath
arrived
who
begging
roams
the
house
for
so
his
penury
enjoins
the
rest
have
him
and
have
fill
his
bag
with
viands
but
antinoüs
hath
bruised
his
shoulder
with
a
hurl
at
him
while
thus
the
queen
conversing
with
her
train
in
her
own
chamber
sat
ulysses
made
plenteous
repast
then
calling
to
her
side
eumæus
thus
she
signified
her
will
eumæus
noble
friend
bid
now
approach
yon
stranger
i
would
speak
with
him
and
ask
if
he
has
seen
ulysses
or
have
heard
tidings
perchance
of
the
afflicted
chief
for
much
a
by
his
garb
he
seems
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
were
those
achaians
silent
thou
shouldst
hear
o
queen
a
tale
that
would
console
thy
heart
three
nights
i
housed
him
and
within
my
cot
three
days
detain
him
for
his
ship
he
left
a
fugitive
and
came
direct
to
me
but
half
untold
his
still
remains
as
when
his
eye
one
fixes
on
a
bard
from
instructed
in
such
themes
as
charm
the
ear
of
mortals
ever
as
he
sings
the
people
press
insatiable
to
hear
so
in
my
cottage
seated
at
my
side
that
stranger
with
his
tale
enchanted
me
laertes
he
affirms
hath
been
his
guest
erewhile
in
crete
where
minos
race
resides
and
thence
he
hath
arrived
after
great
loss
a
suppliant
to
the
very
earth
abased
he
adds
that
in
thesprotia
neighbour
realm
he
of
ulysses
heard
both
that
he
lives
and
that
he
comes
laden
with
riches
home
to
whom
penelope
discrete
replied
haste
call
him
i
would
hear
myself
his
tale
meantime
let

or
in

or
here
their

are
light
for
their

are
secure

save
their

while
my

haunting
my

and
fatted

slay
for
the

and
my

exhaust
extravagant
whence
endless
waste
ensues
for
no
such
friend
as
was
ulysses
once
have
i
to
expel
the
mischief
but
might
he
revisit
once
his
native
shores
again
then
aided
by
his
son
he
should
avenge
incontinent
the
wrongs
which
now
i
mourn
then
sneezed
telemachus
with
sudden
force
that
all
the
palace
rang
his
mother
laugh
and
in
wing
accents
thus
the
swain
bespake
haste
bid
him
hither
thou
not
the
sneeze
propitious
of
my
son
oh
might
it
prove
a
presage
of
inevitable
death
to
all
these
revellers
may
none
escape
now
mark
me
well
should
the
event
his
tale
confirm
at
my
own
hands
he
shall
receive
mantle
and
tunic
both
for
his
reward
she
spake
he
went
and
where
ulysses
sat
arriving
in
wing
accents
thus
began
penelope
my
venerable
friend
calls
thee
the
mother
of
telemachus
oppress
by
troubles
she
desires
to
ask
thee
tidings
of
her
absent
lord
and
should
the
event
verify
thy
report
thy
meed
shall
be
a
boon
which
much
thou
tunic
and
mantle
but
she
gives
no
more
thy
sustenance
thou
must
as
now
obtain
begging
it
at
their
hands
who
chuse
to
give
then
thus
ulysses
hero
eumæus
readily
i
can
relate
truth
and
truth
only
to
the
prudent
queen
icarius
daughter
for
of
him
i
know
much
and
have
sorrows
like
his
own
but
dread
i
feel
of
this
imperious
throng
perverse
whose
riot
and
outrageous
acts
of
violence
echo
through
the
vault
of
and
even
now
when
for
no
fault
of
mine
yon
suitor
struck
me
as
i
pass
and
fill
my
flesh
with
pain
neither
telemachus
nor
any
interposed
to
stay
his
arm
now
therefore
let
penelope
although
impatient
till
the
sun
descend
postpone
her
questions
then
she
may
enquire
secure
when
comes
her
husband
and
may
nearer
place
my
seat
to
the
for
thinly
clad
thou
i
am
whose
aid
i
first
implored
he
ceas
at
whose
reply
eumæus
sought
again
the
queen
but
ere
he
yet
had
pass
the
threshold
thus
she
greeted
his
return
thou
alone
eumæus
why
delays
the
invited
dreads
he
other
harm
or
sees
he
aught
that
with
a
bashful
awe
fills
him
the
bashful
poor
are
poor
indeed
to
whom
eumæus
thou
didst
thus
reply
he
hath
well
spoken
none
who
would
decline
the
rudeness
of
this
contumelious
throng
could
answer
otherwise
thee
he
entreats
to
wait
till
and
that
course
o
queen
thou
shalt
thyself
far
more
commodious
find
to
hold
thy
with
the
guest
alone
then
answer
thus
penelope
return
the
stranger
i
perceive
is
not
unwise
he
be
for
on
the
earth
are
none
proud
insolent
and
profligate
as
these
so
spake
the
queen
then
all
his
message
told
the
good
eumæus
to
the
suitors
went
again
and
with
his
head
inclined
toward
telemachus
lest
others
should
his
words
witness
in
accents
wing
him
thus
address
friend
and
kind
master
i
return
to
keep
my
herds
and
to
attend
my
rural
charge
whence
we
are
both
sustain
keep
thou
meantime
all
here
with
vigilance
but
chiefly
watch
for
thy
own
good
and
save
from
harm
for
here
brood
mischief
whom
the
gods
exterminate
ere
yet
their
plots
prevail
to
whom
telemachus
discrete
replied
so
be
it
father
and
thy
eaten
depart
come
again
bringing
fair
victims
hither
i
will
keep
i
and
the
gods
meantime
all
here
secure
he
ended
then
resumed
once
more
the
swain
his
polish
seat
and
both
with
wine
and
food
now
satiate
to
his
charge
return
the

leaving
and
all
the

grant
him
prosperity

no

hath
he

that
he

when
the

with
evils
unforeseen
smite
him
he
bears
them
with
a
grudging
mind
for
such

the
complexion
of
his

by
the

of
the

of

such
is
the
colour
of
the

of
man
i
too
have
been
familiar
in
my
day
with
wealth
and
ease
but
i
was
then
and
many
wrong
embolden
by
the
thought
of
my

my

let
no
man
therefore
be
unjust
but
each
use
modestly
what
gift

do
not
these
these

the

large
consuming

the

of
one
who
will
not
as
i

remain
long
absent
from

but
is
perchance
at

door
thee
therefore
may
the

steal
hence
in

ah
meet
not
his

to
his

for
they
will
not

for

not

answer
thus
eurynome
return
my

wisely
hast
thou
said

well
go
bathe
thee

anoint
thy

then
give
to

thy

thou
wast

while
to

her

she
spake
telemachus
thou
art
no
longer
wise
as
once
thou
wast
and
even
when
a
child
for
thriven
as
thou
art
and
at
full
size
arrived
of
man
so
fair
proportion
too
that
a
stranger
looking
on
thy
growth
and
beauty
would
pronounce
thee
nobly
born
yet
is
thy
intellect
still
immature
for
what
is
this
why
thou
a
guest
to
be
abused
in
thy
own
palace
how
not
that
if
the
stranger
seated
here
endure
vexation
the
disgrace
is
thine
her
answer
then
telemachus
discrete
i
blame
thee
not
my
mother
that
thou
thine
anger
moved
yet
want
i
not
a
mind
able
to
mark
and
to
discern
between
evil
and
good
child
as
i
lately
was
although
i
find
not
promptitude
of
thought
sufficient
always
overaw
and
by
such
a
multitude
all
bent
alike
on
mischief
of
whom
none
takes
part
with
me
but
irus
and
the
stranger
have
not
fought
urged
by
the
suitors
and
the
stranger
victorious
yes
knows
how
much
i
wish
that
in
the
palace
some
some
in
the
court
the
suitors
all
sat
vanquish
with
their
heads
depending
low
and
with
enfeebled
limbs
even
as
that
same
irus
while
i
speak
with
chin
on
bosom
propp
at
the
sits
incapable
to
stand
erect
or
to
regain
his
proper
home
so
they
and
now
addressing
to
the
queen
his
speech
eurymachus
thus
interposed
o
daughter
of
icarius
could
all
eyes
throughout
iäsian
argos
view
thy
charms
discrete
penelope
more
suitors
still
assembling
in
thy
courts
would
banquet
here
from
morn
to

for
thou
surpassest
far
in
beauty
stature
worth
all
womankind
to
whom
replied
penelope
discrete
the
gods
eurymachus
reduced
to
nought
my
virtue
beauty
stature
when
the
greeks
whom
my
ulysses
follow
sail
to
troy
could
he
returning
my
domestic
charge
himself
intend
far
better
would
my
fame
be
so
secured
and
wider
far
diffused
but
i
am
wretched
now
such
storms
the
gods
of
woe
have
sent
me
when
he
left
his
home
clasping
my
wrist
with
his
right
hand
he
said
my
love
for
i
imagine
not
that
all
the
warrior
greeks
shall
safe
from
troy
return
since
fame
reports
the
trojans
brave
in
fight
skill
in
the
spear
mighty
to
draw
the
bow
and
nimble
vaulters
to
the
backs
of

which
to
speediest
issue
bring
the
dreadful
struggle
of
war
i
know
not
therefore
whether
intend
my
safe
return
or
i
must
perish
there
but
manage
thou
at

cherish
as
now
while
i
am
absent

more
dearly
still
my

and
what
time
our

thou
seest
mature
then
wed
wed
even
whom
thou
wilt
and
hence
to
a

such
were
his
words
all
which

lost
to
all

by

hear

ye

this

methinks
not

hath

to
me
the

he

next

afford
thee

a

at

thou
shalt
not

sufficient

for
which
i
would
supply
thee
all

thou

nor
hast

preferring
much

from

to
extort
wherewith
to

thus

how

my

cut

saturnian
jove
this

excite

thou

roughly
handle
thee

thou

tumult
ensued
among
the

thus
a

with
eyes
directed
to
the
next
exclaim
would
that
this
rambling
stranger
had
elsewhere
perish
or
ever
he
had
here
arrived
then
no

he
caused

it
is
for

we
wrangle
thus

despair
of

look

alone
then
in

telemachus
upstood
majestic

thus
bespake

mad

no

contriving
by

the
destruction

no

the

which

ulysses
going

shine
in

as
with
the

some
celestial
doubtless
is
within
to
whom
ulysses
replied
soft
ask
no
questions
give
no
vent
to

such
is
the
custom
of
the
divine
hence
thou
to

i
stay
that
i
may
yet
both
in
thy

move
more
curiosity
yes
she
with

shall
question
me
of
all
that
i
have
seen
he
ended
and
the

at
his
command
guided
by
flaming
torches
sought
the
couch
where
he
was
wont
to
sleep
and
there
he
slept
on
that
night
also
waiting
the
approach
of
sacred
dawn
thus
was
ulysses
left
alone
and
planning
sat
in
solitude
by
pallas

the
slaughter
of
his
foes
at
length
or
like

left
enter
penelope
beside

her

planted
her
accustom
seat
with
silver
wreathed

icmalius
made

and
a
footstool
to
its
splendid
frame
beneath
which
ever
with
an
ample

they
spread
there
sat
discrete
penelope
then
came
her
beautiful
attendants
from
within
who
cleared
the
litter
bread
the
board
and
cups
from
which
the
insolent
companions
drank
they
also
raked
the
embers
from
the
hearths
now
dim
and
with
fresh
billets
piled
them
high
both
for
illumination

for

then
yet
again
melantho
with

opprobrious
thus
assail

ear
guest
wilt
thou
trouble
us
throughout

thou
a

hence
get
thee

found
or
soon
with

beaten
we
will
thrust
thee
forth
to
whom
ulysses
frowning
stern
replied
petulant
woman
wherefore
thus
incensed
thou
against
me
is
it
because
i
am
not
sleek
because
my
garb
is
mean
because
i
beg
thanks
to
necessity
i
would
not
else
but
such
as
i
appear
such
all
who
beg
and
all
who
wander
are
i
also
lived
the
happy
owner
once
of
such

stately
mansion
and
have
to
they

all
that
they
needed
i
was
also
served
by
many
and
enjoy
all
that
denotes
the
envied
owner
opulent
and
blest
but
jove
for
so
it
pleas
him
hath
reduced
my
all
to

therefore
well
beware
thou
also
mistress
lest
a
day
arrive
when
all
these
charms
by
which
thou
among
thy
fade
fear
too
lest
her

irritate

thou
and
lest
ulysses
come
of
whose

hope
yet
survives
but
even
though
the

as
ye

no

his

how
bright
the
gifts
shine
of

in
the

prince
telemachus
no
woman
unobserved
by
him
can
now
commit
a
trespass
here
his
days
of
heedless
infancy
are
past
he
ended
whom
penelope
discrete
her
attendant
sharp
rebuked
shameless
audacious
woman
known
to
me
is
thy
great
wickedness
which
with
thy
life
thou
shalt
atone
for
thou
wast
well
aware
hearing
it
from
myself
that
i
to
ask
this
stranger
of
my
absent
lord
for
whose
dear
sake
i
never
cease
to
mourn
then
to
her
household
governess
she
said
bring
now
a
seat
and
spread
it
with
a
fleece
eurynome
that
undisturb
the
guest
may
hear
and
answer
all
that
i
shall
ask
she
ended
then
the
matron
brought
in
haste
a
polish
seat
and
spread
it
with
a
fleece
on
which
the
hero
sat
and
thus
the
chaste
penelope
began
stranger
my
first
enquiry
shall
be
this
who
art
thou
whence
where
born
and
sprung
from
whom
then
answer
thus
ulysses
wise
return
o
queen
uncensurable
by
the
lips
of
mortal
man
thy
glory
climbs
the
skies
unrivall
like
the
praise
of
some
great
king
who
a
people
and
presiding
like
a
deity
maintains
justice
and
truth
the
earth
under
his
sway
her
produce
yields
abundantly
the
trees
bend
the
lusty
flocks
bring
forth
the
ocean
teems
with
finny
swarms
beneath
his
just
controul
and
all
the
land
is
blest
me
therefore
question
of
what
else
thou
wilt
in
thy
own
palace
but
forbear
to
ask
from
whom
i
sprang
and
of
my
native
land
lest
thou
reminding
me
of
those
sad
themes
augment
my
woes
for
i
have
much
endured
nor
were
it
seemly
in
another
house
to
pass
the
hours
in
sorrow
and
in
tears
wearisome
when
indulg
with
no
regard
to
time
or
place
thy
train
perchance
thyself
would
blame
me
and
i
should
reproach
incur
as
one
through
excess
of
wine
him
answer
then
penelope
discrete
the
immortal
gods
o
stranger
then
my
form
my
grace
my
beauty
when
the
greeks
whom
my
ulysses
follow
sail
to
troy
could
he
returning
my
domestic
charge
himself
intend
far
better
would
my
fame
be
so
secured
and
wider
far
diffused
but
i
am
wretched
now
such
storms
of
woe
the
gods
have
sent
me
for
as
many
chiefs
as
hold
dominion
in
the
neighbour
isles
samos
dulichium
and
the
zacynthus
others
also
rulers
here
in
pleasant
ithaca
me
loth
to
wed
woo
ceaseless
and
my
household
stores
consume
i
therefore
neither
guest
nor
suppliant
heed
nor
public
herald
more
but
with
regret
of
my
ulysses
wear
my
soul
away
they
meantime
press
my
nuptials
which
by
art
i
still
procrastinate
some
god
the
thought
suggested
to
me
to
commence
a
robe
of
amplest
measure
and
of
subtlest
woof
laborious
task
which
done
i
thus
address
them
princes
my
suitors
since
the
noble
chief
ulysses
is
no
more
enforce
not
now
my
nuptials
wait
till
i
shall
finish
first
a
robe
lest
all
my
threads
be
marr
which
for
the
ancient
hero
i
prepare
laertes
looking
for
the
mournful
hour
when
fate
shall
snatch
him
to
eternal
rest
else
i
the
censure
dread
of
all
my
sex
should
he
so
wealthy
want
at
last
a
shroud
such
was
my
speech
they
unsuspicious
all
with
my
request
complied
thenceforth
all
day
i
wove
the
ample
web
and
by
the
aid
of
torches
ravell
it
again
at
night
three
years
by
artifice
i
thus
their
suit
eluded
safe
but
when
the
fourth
arrived
and
the
same
season
after
many
moons
and
fleeting
days
return
passing
my
train
who
had
neglected
to
release
the
dogs
they
came
surprized
and
reprimanded
me
thus
through
necessity
not
choice
at
last
i
have
perform
it
in
my
own
despight
but
no
escape
from
marriage
now
remains
nor
other
subterfuge
for
me
meantime
my
parents
urge
my
nuptials
and
my
son
of
age
to
note
it
with
disgust
observes
his
wealth
consumed
for
he
is
now
become
adult
and
abler
than
myself
to
rule
the
house
a
prince
distinguish
by
the
gods
yet
stranger
after
all
speak
thy

whence
thou

then
but
know
that
thou

much
augment
my

grief

to
a

long
exiled
from
his

through
various
cities
of

remote
and
woes
endured
yet
though
it
pain
me
i
will
tell
thee
all
there
is
a
land
amid
the
sable
flood

crete
fair

circled
by
the

are
her
inhabitants
a
race

and
ninety
towns
she
boasts
diverse
their
language
is
achaians
some

some
indigenous
are
cydonians
there
dorians
and
pelasgians
dwell
one
city
in
extent
the
rest
exceeds
cnossus
the
city
in
which
minos

who
ever
at
a
nine
years
close
with

himself
from

my

his
gallant

the
atridæ
i
the
by
my
illustrious
name
æthon
am
known
but
he
ranks
foremost
both
in

and
years
there
i
beheld
ulysses
and
within
my
walls
receiv
him
for
a
violent
wind
had
him
from

while
he
sought
the
shores
of

to
crete
the

his
barks
bore
into
the
amnisus
for
the
cave
of
ilythia
known

and
which
with
difficulty
he
attain
he
landing
instant
to

went
seeking
idomeneus
his
friend
of
old
as
he
affirm
and
one
whom
much
he
lov
but
was
far
remote
ten
days
advanced
perhaps
eleven
on
his
course
to
troy
him
therefore
i
conducted
to
my
home
where
hospitably
and
with
kindest
care
i
entertain
him
for
i
wanted
nought
and
for
himself
procured
and
for
his
band
by
public
contribution
corn
and
wine
and
beeves
for
food
that
all
might
be
sufficed
twelve
days
his
noble
greecians
there
abode
by
boreas
blowing
with
a
force
resistless
even
on
the
land
some
god
so
roused
his
fury
but
the
thirteenth
day
the
wind
all
fell
and
they
embark
again
with
many
a
fiction
specious
as
he
sat
he
thus
her
ear
amused
she
at
the
sound
melting
with
fluent
tears
her
cheeks
bedew
and
as
the
snow
by
zephyrus
diffused
melts
on
the
mountain
tops
when
eurus
breathes
and
fills
the
channels
of
the
running
streams
so
melted
she
and
down
her
lovely
cheeks
pour
fast
the
tears
him
mourning
as
remote
who
sat
beside
her
soft
compassion
ulysses
of
his
consort
silent
woe
his
eyes
as
they
had
been
of
steel
or
horn
moved
not
yet
artful
he
suppress
his
tears
and
she
at
length
with
overflowing
grief
satiate
replied
and
thus
enquired
again
now
stranger
i
shall
prove
thee
as
i
judge
if
thou
indeed
hast
entertain
in
crete
my
spouse
and
his
brave
followers
as
thou
describe
his
raiment
and
himself
his
own
appearance
and
the
appearance
of
his
friends
then
her
ulysses
answer
hard
is
the
task
o
queen
so
long
a
time
hath
since
elaps
to
tell
thee
twenty
years
have
pass
since
he
forsook
my
native
isle
yet
from
my
best
remembrance
i
will
give
a
likeness
of
him
such
as
now
i
may
a
double
cloak
mœonian
dyed
the
noble
chief
had
on
two
held
the
golden
clasp
and
it
display
in
front
a
pattern
with
much
art
design
an
hound
between
his
holding
fast
a
dappled
fawn
gaped
eager
on
his
prey
all
wonder
seeing
how
in
lifeless
gold
express
the
dog
with
open
mouth
her
throat
attempted
still
and
how
the
fawn
with
hoofs
thrust
trembling
forward
struggled
to
escape
that
glorious
mantle
much
i
noticed
soft
to
touch
as
the
dried
garlick
glossy
film
such
was
the
smoothness
of
it
and
it
shone
full
many
a
maiden
trust
me
the
splendid
texture
with
admiring
eyes
but
mark
me
now
deep
treasure
in
thy
mind
this
word
i
know
not
if
ulysses
wore
that
cloak
at
home
or
whether
of
his
train
some
warrior
gave
it
to
him
on
his
way
or
else
some
host
of
his
for
many
loved
ulysses
and
with
him
might
few
compare
i
gave
to
him
myself
a
brazen
sword
a
purple
cloak
magnificent
and
vest
of
royal
length
and
when
he
sought
his
bark
with
princely
pomp
dismiss
him
from
the
shore
an
herald
also
waited
on
the
chief
somewhat
his
senior
him
i
next
describe
his
back
was
bunch
his
visage
swarthy
his
poll
and
he
was
named
eurybates
a
man
whom
most
of
all
his
followers
far
ulysses
honour
for
their
minds
were
one
he
ceased
she
recognising
all
the
proofs
distinctly
by
ulysses
named
was
moved
still
more
to
weep
till
with
grief
satiate
at
length
she
answer
him
again
henceforth
o
stranger
thou
who
hadst
before
my
pity
shalt
my
share
and
love
i
folded
for
him
with
these
hands
the
cloak
which
thou
produced
it
when
he
went
and
gave
it
to
him
i
that
splendid
clasp
attach
to
it
myself
more
to
adorn
my
honour
lord
whom
to
his
native
land
return
secure
i
shall
receive
no
more
in
such
an
evil
hour
ulysses
went
to
that
bad
city
never
to
be
named
to
whom
ulysses
replied
consort
revered
of
laertiades
no
longer
let
anxiety
impair
thy
beauteous
form
nor
any
grief
consume
thy
spirits
more
for
thy
ulysses
sake
and
yet
i
blame
thee
not
a
wife
deprived
of
her
first
mate
to
whom
she
had
produced
fair
fruit
of
mutual

she
then
approaching

to
her

and
at

and
offence
to

ulysses
and
when
grown
mature
he
shall
parnassus
visit
the
abode
magnificent
in
which
his
mother
dwelt
and
where
my
treasures
lie
from
my
own
stores
i
will
enrich
and
send

joyful
home
ulysses
therefore
that
he
might
obtain
those
princely
gifts
went
thither
him
arrived
with
gratulation
and
with
words
of
welcome
kind
autolycus
received
nor
less
his
offspring
but
the
mother
most
of
his
own
mother
clung
around
his
neck
amphithea
she
with
many
a
fervent
kiss
his
forehead
press
and
his
eyes
then
bade
autolycus
his
noble
sons
set
forth
a
banquet
they
at
his
command
led
in
a
fatted
ox
of
the
fifth
year
which
slaying
first
they
spread
him
carved
abroad
then
scored
his
flesh
transfixed
it
with
the
spits
and
roasting
all
with
culinary
skill
exact
gave
each
his
portion
thus
they
sat
feasting
all
day
and
till
the
sun
declined
but
when
the
sun
declined
and
darkness
fell
each
sought
his
couch
and
took
the
gift
of
sleep
then
soon
as
daughter
aurora
look
abroad
forth
went
the
hounds
and
with
the
hounds
ulysses
and
the
youths
sons
of
autolycus
to
chase
the
boar
arrived
at
the
parnassian
mount
they
his
bushy
sides
and
to
his
airy
heights
ere
long
attain
it
was
the
pleasant
hour
when
from
the
flood
profound
the
sun
emerging
first
smote
on
the
fields
the
hunters
reach
the
valley
foremost
ran
questing
the
hounds
behind
them
swift
the
sons
came
of
autolycus
with
whom
advanced
the
illustrious
prince
ulysses
pressing
close
the
hounds
and
brandishing
his
massy
spear
there
hid
in
thickest
shades
lay
an
huge
boar
that
covert
neither
rough
winds
blowing
moist
could
penetrate
nor
could
the
sun
smite
through
it
or
pervade
so
thick
it
was
and
underneath
the
ground
with
litter
of
dry
foliage
strew
profuse
hunters
and
dogs
approaching
him
his
ear
the
sound
of
feet
perceived
upridging
high
his
bristly
back
and
glaring
fire
he
sprang
forth
from
the
shrubs
and
in
defiance
stood
near
and
right
opposite
ulysses
first
rush
on
him
elevating
his
long
spear
ardent
to
wound
him
but
preventing
quick
his
foe
the
boar
gash
him
above
the
knee
much
flesh
assailing
him
oblique
he
tore
with
his
rude
tusk
but
to
the
hero
bone
pierced
not
ulysses
right
shoulder
reach
and
with
a
deadly
thrust
impell
the
point
of
his
bright
spear
through
him
and
far
beyond
loud
yell
the
boar
sank
in
the
dust
and
died
around
ulysses
then
the
busy
sons
throng
of
autolycus
expert
they
braced
the
wound
of
the
illustrious
hunter
bold
with
incantation
staunched
the
sable
blood
and
sought
in
haste
their
father
house
again
whence
heal
and
gratified
with
splendid
gifts
they
sent
him
soon
rejoicing
to
his
home
themselves
rejoicing
also
glad
their
son
his
parents
saw
again
and
of
the
scar
enquired
where
and
how
he
told
them
all
how
to
parnassus
with
his
friends
he
went
sons
of
autolycus
to
hunt
and
how
a
boar
had
gash
him
with
his
tusk
that
scar
while
chafing
him
with
open
palms
the
matron
knew
she
left
his
foot
to
fall
down
dropp
his
leg
into
the
vase
the
brass
rang
and
by
the
sudden
shock
poured
forth
the
water
flooding
wide
the
floor
spirit
joy
at
once
and
sorrow
seized
tears
fill
her
eyes
her
intercepted
voice
died
in
her
throat
but
to
ulysses
beard
her
hand
advancing
thus
at
length
she
spake
thou
art
himself
ulysses
oh
my
son
dear
to
me
and
my
master
as
thou
art
i
knew
thee
not
till
i
had
touch
the
scar
she
said
and
to
penelope
her
eyes
directed
all
impatient
to
declare
her
own
ulysses
even
then
at
home
but
she
nor
eye
nor
ear
for
aught
that
had
then
her
fixt
attention
so
entire
minerva
had
engaged
then
darting
forth
his
arms
the
hero
with
his
close
compress
her
throat
and
nearer
to
himself
drawing
her
with
his
left
thus
caution
her
why
thou
ruin
me
thou
me
milk
thyself
from
thy
own
breast
see
me
after
long
in
the
twentieth
year
to
my
own
land
but
since
some
god
the
thought
suggesting
to
thee
thou
hast
learn
the
truth
silence
lest
others
learn
it
from
thy
lips
for
this
i
say
nor
shall
the
threat
be
vain
if
god
vouchsafe
to
me
to
overcome
the
haughty
suitors
when
i
shall
inflict
death
on
the
other
women
of
my
house
although
my
nurse
thyself
shalt
also
die
him
answer
euryclea
then
discrete
my
son
oh
how
could
so
severe
a
word
escape
thy
lips
my
fortitude
of
mind
thou
and
even
now
shalt
prove
me
firm
as
iron
secret
as
the
stubborn
rock
but
hear
and
mark
me
well
thou
prevail
assisted
by
a
divine
to
slay
the
haughty
suitors
i
will
then
myself
give
thee
to
know
of
all
the
female
train
who
have
dishonour
thee
and
who
respect
to
whom
ulysses
replied
my
nurse
it
were
superfluous
spare
thy
tongue
that
needless
task
i
can
distinguish
well
myself
between
them
and
shall
know
them
all
but
hold
thy
peace
hush
leave
it
with
the
gods
so
he
then
went
the
ancient
matron
forth
that
she
might
serve
him
with
a
second
bath
for
the
whole
first
was
spilt
thus
laved
at
length
and
smooth
with
oil
ulysses
nearer
his
seat
toward
the
glowing
hearth
to
enjoy
more
warmth
and
drew
his
tatters
the
scar
then
prudent
thus
penelope
began
one
question
stranger
i
shall
yet
propound
though
brief
for
soon
the
hour
of
soft
repose
grateful
to
all
and
even
to
the
sad
whom
gentle
sleep
forsakes
not
will
arrive
but
to
me
immeasurable
woe
assigns
whose
sole
delight
is
to
consume
my
days
in
sighs
while
here
retired
i
sit
watching
my
maidens
labours
and
my
own
but
night
return
and
all
to
bed
retired
i
press
mine
also
yet
with
deep
regret
and
anguish
lacerated
even
there
as
when
at
spring
first
entrance
her
sweet
song
the
nightingale
renews
daughter
of
pandarus
within
the
thick
foliage
perch
she
pours
her
echoing
voice
now
deep
now
clear
still
varying
the
strain
with
which
she
mourns
her
itylus
her
son
by
royal
zethus
whom
she
erring
slew
so
also
i
by
doubts
toss
ever
muse
if
i
shall
here
remain
a
faithful
guardian
of
my
son
affairs
my
husband
bed
respecting
and
not
less
my
own
fair
fame
or
whether
i
shall
him
of
all
my
suitors
follow
to
his
home
who
noblest
seems
and
offers
richest
my
son
while
he
was
infant
yet
and
own
an
infant
mind
could
never
give
consent
that
i
should
wed
and
leave
him
but
at
length
since
he
hath
reached
the
stature
of
a
man
he
wishes
my
departure
hence
the
waste
viewing
indignant
by
the
suitors
made
but
i
have
dream
hear
and
expound
my
dream
my
geese
are
twenty
which
within
my
walls
i
feed
with
sodden
wheat
they
serve
to
amuse
sometimes
my
sorrow
from
the
mountains
came
an
eagle
huge
brake
all
their
necks
and
slew
them
scatter
on
the
they
lay
and
he
soar
swift
into
the
skies
dream
only
as
it
was
i
wept
aloud
till
all
my
maidens
gather
by
my
voice
arriving
found
me
weeping
still
and
still
complaining
that
the
eagle
had
at
once
slain
all
my
geese
but
to
the
stooping
again
he
sat
and
with
a
voice
of
human
sound
forbad
my
tears
and
said
courage
o
daughter
of
the
icarius
no
vain
dream
thou
hast
beheld
but
in
thy
sleep
a
truth
the
slaughter
geese
denote
thy
suitors
i
who
have
an
eagle
in
thy
sight
am
yet
indeed
thy
husband
who
have
now
at
last
return
death
horrid
death
designing
for
them
all
he
said
then
waking
at
the
voice
i
cast
an
anxious
look
around
and
saw
my
geese
beside
their
tray
all
feeding
as
before
her
then
ulysses
answer
o
queen
it
is
not
possible
to
miss
thy
dream
plain
import
since
ulysses
self
hath
told
thee
the
event
thy
suitors
all
must
perish
not
one
suitor
shall
escape
to
whom
penelope
discrete
replied
dreams
are
inexplicable
o
my
guest
and
mere
delusions
that
receive
no
just

sat

ate
till

he
replied
enough
but
when
the
hour
of
sleep
call
him
to
rest
she
gave
commandment
to
her
female
train
to
spread
his
couch
yet
he
like
one
forlorn
and
through
despair
to
himself
both
bed

refused

in

on

forth
went

with

will
not
long
be
absent
but
will
early
come
for
this
day
is
a
public
festival
so
she
whom
all
obedient
heard
forth
went
together
twenty
to
the
crystal
fount
while
in

provinces
the
rest
bestirr
them
brisk
at

then
enter
all
the

and
began
cleaving
the
wood
meantime
the

from

came

soon
the
follow
driving
three
his
fattest
brawns
them
in

court
he
feeding
left

to

side
approaching
courteously
bespake
the
chief
guest
look
the
greecians
on
thee
with
respect
at
length
or
still
disdainful
as
before
then
answer
thus
ulysses
wise
return
yes
and
i
would
that
vengeance
from
the
gods
might
pay
their
insolence
who
in
a
house
not
theirs
dominion
exercise
and
plan
unseemly
projects
shameless
as
they
are
thus
they
conferr
and
now
melanthius
came
the
driving
with
the
aid
of
two
his
the
fattest
of
his
goats
to
feast
the
suitors
in
the
sounding
porch
the
goats
he
tied
then
drawing
near
in
terms
reproachful
thus
assail
ulysses
ear
how
stranger
thou
begging
still
to
vex
the
suitors
wilt
thou
not
depart
scarce
shall
we
settle
this
dispute
i
judge
till
we
have
tasted
each
the
other
fist
thou
art
unreasonable
thus
to
beg
here
always
have
the
greeks
no
feasts
beside
he
spake
to
whom
ulysses
answer
none
return
but
shook
his
brows
and
silent
framed
terrible
purposes
then
third
chief
the
herds
philœtius
fatted
goats
he
for
the
suitors
brought
with
which
he
drove
an
heifer
had
pass
them
carriers
of
all
who
on
their
coast
arrive
he
tied
them
in
the
sounding
porch
then
stood
beside
the
to
whom
thus
he
said
who
is
this
guest
eumæus
here
arrived
so
lately
from
what
nation
hath
he
come
what
parentage
and
country
boasts
the
man
i
pity
him
whose
figure
seems
to
speak
royalty
in
him
will
surely
plunge
the
race
of
common
deep
in
woe
if
thus
it
destine
even
kings
to
mourn
he
ceas
and
with
his
right
hand
drawing
nigh
welcom
ulysses
whom
he
thus
bespake
hail
venerable
guest
and
be
thy
lot
at
least
hereafter
who
art
held
at
present
in
the
bonds
of
ills
thou
jupiter
of
all
the
gods
art
most
severe
and
not
to
inflict
distress
even
on
creatures
from
thyself
derived
i
had
no
sooner
mark
thee
than
my
eyes
swam
and
the
sweat
gush
from
me
at
the
thought
of
dear
ulysses
for
if
yet
he
live
and
see
the
sun
such
tatters
i
suppose
he
wears
a
among
but
if
already
with
the
dead
he
dwell
in
pluto
drear
abode
oh
then
alas
for
kind
ulysses
who
consign
to
me
while
yet
a
boy
his
cephalenian
herds
and
they
have
now
encreas
to
such
a
store
innumerable
of
beeves
as
only
care
like
mine
could
have
produced
these
by
command
of
others
i
transport
for
their
regale
who
neither
heed
his
son
nor
tremble
at
the
anger
of
the
gods
but
long
have
wish
ardently
to
divide
and
share
the
substance
of
our
absent
lord
me
therefore
this
thought
occupies
and
haunts
my
mind
not
seldom
while
the
heir
survives
it
were
no
small
offence
to
drive
his
herds
afar
and
migrate
to
a
foreign
land
yet
here
to
dwell
oppressive
wrongs
while
i
attend
another
beeves
appears
still
less
supportable
and
i
had
fled
and
i
had
served
some
other
mighty
chief
long
since
for
patience
fails
me
to
endure
my
present
lot
but
that
i
cherish
still
some
hope
of
my
lord
return
to
rid
his
palace
of
those
lawless
guests
to
whom
ulysses
replied
herdsman
since
neither
void
of
sense
thou
nor
yet
dishonest
but
myself
am
sure
that
thou
art
owner
of
a
mind
discrete
hear
therefore
for
i
swear
bold
i
attest
jove
and
this
hospitable
board
and
these
the
lares
of
the
noble
chief
whose
hearth
protects
me
now
that
ere
thy
going
hence
ulysses
surely
shall
have
reach
his
home
and
thou
shalt
see
him
if
thou
wilt
thyself
slaying
the
suitors
who
now
lord
it
here
him
answer
then
the
keeper
of
his
beeves
oh
stranger
would
but
the
saturnian
king
perform
that
word
thou
be
taught
thyself
of
it
what
an
arm
is
mine
eumæus
also
power
of
entreated
that
ulysses
might
possess
his
home
again
thus
mutual
they
conferr
meantime
in
close
the
suitors
death
for
telemachus
but
while
they
sat
consulting
on
their
left
the
bird
of
jove
an
eagle
soar
grasping
a
dove
then
thus
amphinomus
the
rest
bespake
oh
friends
our
consultation
how
to
slay
telemachus
will
never
smoothly
run
to
its
effect
but
let
us
to
the
feast
so
spake
amphinomus
whose
counsel
pleased
then
all
into
the
royal
house
repaired
and
on
the
thrones
and
couches
throwing
off
their
mantles
slew
the
fatted
goats
the
brawns
the
sheep
and
heifer
of
the
herd
the
roasted
entrails
first
they
shared
then
the
beakers
and
the
placed
the
cups
philœtius
chief
intendant
of
the
beeves
served
all
with
baskets
elegant
of
bread
while
all
their
cups
melanthius
charged
with
wine
and
they
assail
at
once
the
ready
feast
meantime
telemachus
with
forecast
shrewd
fast
by
the
marble
threshold
but
within
the
spacious
hall
his
father
placed
to
whom
a
sordid
seat
he
gave
and
scanty
board
a
portion
of
the
entrails
next
he
set
before
him
fill
a
golden
goblet
high
and
thus
in
presence
of
them
all
began
there
seated
now
drink
as
the
suitors
drink
i
will
myself
their
biting
taunts
forbid
and
violence
this
edifice
is
mine
not
public
property
my
father
first
possess
it
and
my
right
from
him
descends
suitors
controul
your
tongues
nor
with
your
hands
offend
lest
contest
fierce
and
war
ensue
he
ceas
they
gnawing
sat
their
lips
aghast
with
wonder
that
telemachus
in
his
speech
such
boldness
used
then
spake
eupithes
son
antinoüs
and
the
assembly
thus
address
let
pass
ye
greeks
the
language
of
the
prince
harsh
as
it
is
and
big
with
threats
to
us
had
jove
permitted
his
orations
here
although
thus
eloquent
ere
now
had
ceased
so
spake
antinoüs
whom
ulysses
son
heard
unconcern
and
now
the
heralds
came
in
solemn
pomp
conducting
through
the
streets
a
sacred
hecatomb
when
in
the
grove
umbrageous
of
apollo
king
the
assembled
greecians
met
the
roast
finish
and
from
the
spits
withdrawn
each
shared
his
portion
of
the
noble
feast
and
such
as
they
enjoy
themselves
the
attendants
placed
before
ulysses
for
the
hero
son
himself
telemachus
had
so
enjoined
but
pallas
that
they
might
more
ulysses
suffer
not
the
suitor
chiefs
to
banquet
guiltless
of
scoffs
malign
there
was
a
certain
suitor
named
ctesippus
born
in
samos
base
of
mind
was
he
and
profligate
but
in
the
wealth
confiding
of
his
father
woo
the
wife
of
ulysses
from
his
seat
the
haughty
suitors
thus
that
man
address
ye
noble
suitors
i
would
speak
attend
the
guest
is
served
he
hath
already
shared
equal
with
us
nor
less
the
laws
demand
of
hospitality
for
neither
just
it
were
nor
decent
that
a
guest
received
here
by
telemachus
should
be
denied
his
portion
of
the
feast
come
then
myself
will
give
to
him
that
he
may
also
give
to
her
who
laved
him
in
the
bath
or
else
to
whatsoever
menial
here
he
will
so
saying
he
from
a
basket
near
at
hand
heav
an
and
with
a
arm
hurl
it
ulysses
gently
bow
his
head
shunning
the
blow
but
gratified
his
just
resentment
with
a
broad
sardonic
smile
of
dread
significance
he
smote
the
wall
then
thus
telemachus
rebuked
the
deed
ctesippus
thou
art
fortunate
the
bone
struck
not
the
stranger
for
he
shunn
the
blow
else
i
had
surely
thrust
my
lance
right
through
thee
then
no
hymenæal
rites
of
thine
should
have
employ
thy
father
here
but
thy
funereal
no
man
therefore
treat
me
with
indignity
within
these
walls
for
though
of
late
a
child
i
can
discern
now
and
distinguish
between
good
and
suffice
it
that
we
patiently
endure
to
be
spectators
daily
of
our
sheep
slaughter
our
bread
consumed
our
stores
of
wine
wasted
for
what
can
one
to
all
opposed
come
then
persist
no
longer
in
offence
and
hostile
hate
of
me
or
if
ye
wish
to
slay
me
pause
not
it
were
better
far
to
die
and
i
had
rather
much
be
slain
than
thus
to
witness
your
atrocious
deeds
day
after
day
to
see
our
guests
abused
with
blows
insulted
and
the
women
with
a
licentious
violence
obscene
from
side
to
side
of
all
this
fair
abode
he
said
and
all
sat
silent
till
at
length
thus
agelaüs
spake
diastor
son
my
friends
let
none
with
contradiction
thwart
and
rude
reply
words
rational
and
just
assault
no
more
the
stranger
nor
of
all
the
servants
of
renown
ulysses
here
harm
any
my
advice
both
to
the
queen
and
to
telemachus
shall
gentle
be
may
it
but
please
them
while
the
hope
survived
within
your
bosoms
of
the
safe
return
of
wise
ulysses
to
his
native
isle
so
long
good
reason
was
that
she
should
use
delay
and
hold
our
wooing
in
suspence
for
had
ulysses
come
that
course
had
proved
wisest
and
best
but
that
he
comes
no
more
appears
now
manifest
thou
therefore
prince
seeking
thy
mother
counsel
her
to
wed
the
noblest
and
who
offers
richest
that
thou
for
thy
peculiar
enjoy
thy
own
inheritance
in
peace
and
ease
and
she
departing
find
another
home
to
whom
telemachus
discrete
replied
i
swear
by
jove
and
by
my
father
woes
who
either
hath
deceased
far
from
his
home
or
lives
a
that
i
interpose
no
hindrance
to
her
nuptials
let
her
wed
who
offers
most
and
even
whom
she
will
but
to
dismiss
her
rudely
were
a
deed
unfilial
that
i
dare
not
god
forbid
so
spake
telemachus
then
pallas
struck
the
suitors
with
delirium
wide
they
their
jaws
with
unspontaneous
laughter
loud
their
meat
dripp
blood
tears
fill
their
eyes
and
dire
presages
of
approaching
woe
their
hearts
then
thus
the
prophet
theoclymenus
ah
miserable
men
what
curse
is
this
that
takes
you
now
night
wraps
itself
around
your
faces
bodies
limbs
the
palace
shakes
with
peals
of
groans
and
oh
what
floods
ye
weep
i
see
the
walls
and
arches
dappled
thick
with
gore
the
vestibule
is
throng
the
court
on
all
sides
throng
with
apparitions
grim
of
slaughter
men
sinking
into
the
gloom
of
erebus
the
sun
is
blotted
out
from
and
midnight
whelms
you
premature
he
said
they
hearing
laugh
and
thus
the
son
of
polybus
eurymachus
replied
this
from
a
distant
shore
hath
left
his
wits
behind
hoa
there
conduct
him
hence
into
the
forum
since
he
dreams
it
night
already
teach
him
there
that
it
is
day
then
answer
godlike
theoclymenus
i
have
no
need
eurymachus
of
guides
to
lead
me
hence
for
i
have
eyes
and
ears
the
use
of
both
my
feet
and
of
a
mind
in
no
respect
irrational
or
wild
these
shall
conduct
me
forth
for
well
i
know
that
evil
threatens
you
such
too
as
none
shall
of
all
the
suitors
whose
delight
is
to
insult
the
unoffending
guest
received
beneath
this
hospitable
roof
he
said
and
issuing
from
the
palace
sought
piræus
house
who
gladly
welcom
him
then
all
the
suitors
on
each
other
cast
a
look
significant
and
to
provoke
telemachus
the
more
fleer
at
his
guests
of
whom
a
youth
thus
insolent
began
no
living
wight
telemachus
had
guests
such
as
thine
witness
we
know
not
who
this
hungry
vagabond
whose
means
of
life
are
none
and
who
hath
neither
skill
nor
force
to
earn
them
a
mere
burthen
on
the
ground
witness
the
other
also
who
upstarts
a

suddenly
take
my
advice
i
counsel
wisely
send
them
both
on
board
some
gallant
bark
to
sicily
for
sale
thus
shall
they
somewhat
profit
thee
at
last
so
spake
the
suitors
whom
telemachus
heard
unconcern
and
silent
look
and
toward
his
father
watching
still
the
time
when
he
should
punish
that
licentious
throng
meantime
icarius
daughter
who
had
placed
her
splendid

opposite
heard
distinct
their
taunting
speeches
they
with
noisy
mirth
feasted
deliciously
for
they
had
slain
many
a
fat
victim
but
a
sadder
feast

with

the

penelope
with

and

to
prove
her

in

courts
a
game
terrible
in
conclusion
to
them
all
first
taking
in
her
hand
the
brazen
key
and
fitted
with
an
grasp
attended
by
the
women
of
her
train
she
sought
her
inmost
chamber
the
recess
in
which
she
kept
the
treasures
of
her
lord
his
brass
his
gold
and
steel
elaborate
here
lay
his
stubborn
bow
and
quiver
with
shafts
a
fatal
store
that
bow
he
had
received
and
quiver
from
the
hand
of
godlike
iphitus
eurytides
whom
in
messenia
in
the
house
he
met
of
brave
orsilochus
ulysses
came
demanding
payment
of
arrearage
due
from
all
that
land
for
a
messenian
fleet
had
borne
from
ithaca
three
hundred
sheep
with
all
their
shepherds
for
which
cause
ere
yet
adult
he
voyaged
to
that
distant
shore
deputed
by
his
sire
and
by
the
chiefs
of
ithaca
to
make
the
just
demand
but
iphitus
had
thither
come
to
seek
twelve
mares
and
twelve
mule
colts
which
he
had
lost
a
search
that
cost
him
soon
a
bloody
death
for
coming
to
the
house
of
hercules
the
valiant
son
of
jove
he
perish
there
slain
by
his
cruel
host
who
heedless
of
wrath
and
of
the
rights
of
his
own
board
first
fed
then
slaughter
him
for
in
house
the
mares
and
colts
were
hidden
he
therefore
occupied
in
that
concern
meeting
ulysses
there
gave
him
the
bow
which
erst
huge
eurytus
had
borne
and
which
himself
had
from
his
dying
sire
received
ulysses
in
return
on
him
bestowed
a
spear
and
sword
pledges
of
future
love
and
hospitality
but
never
more
they
met
each
other
at
the
friendly
board
for
ere
that
hour
arrived
the
son
of
jove
slew
his
own
guest
the
godlike
iphitus
thus
came
the
bow
into
ulysses
hands
which
never
in
his
gallant
barks
he
bore
to
battle
with
him
though
he
used
it
oft
in
times
of
peace
but
left
it
safely
stored
at
home
a
dear
memorial
of
his
friend
soon
as
divinest
of
her
sex
arrived
at
that
same
chamber
with
her
foot
she
press
the
oaken
threshold
bright
on
which
the
hand
of
no
mean
architect
had
stretch
the
line
who
had
erected
also
on
each
side
the
posts
on
which
the
splendid
portals
hung
she
loos
the
ring
and
brace
then
introduced
the
key
and
aiming
at
them
from
without
struck
back
the
bolts
the
portals
at
that
stroke
sent
forth
a
tone
deep
as
the
pastur
bull
and
flew
wide
open
she
ascending
next
the
elevated
floor
on
which
the
chests
that
held
her
own
fragrant
apparel
stood
with
lifted
hand
aloft
took
down
the
bow
in
its
embroider
safe
enclosed
then
sitting
there
she
lay
it
on
her
knees
weeping
aloud
and
drew
it
from
the
case
thus
weeping
over
it
long
time
she
sat
till
satiate
at
the
last
with
grief
and
tears
descending
by
the
palace
steps
she
sought
again
the
haughty
suitors
with
the
bow
elastic
and
the
quiver
in
her
hand
replete
with
pointed
shafts
a
deadly
store
her
maidens
as
she
went
bore
after
her
a
coffer
fill
with
prizes
by
her
lord
much
brass
and
steel
and
when
at
length
she
came
loveliest
of
women
where
the
suitors
sat
between
the
pillars
of
the
stately
dome
pausing
before
her
beauteous
face
she
held
her
lucid
veil
and
by
two
matrons
chaste
supported
the
assembly
thus
address
ye
noble
suitors
hear
who
rudely
haunt
this
palace
of
a
chief
long
absent
hence
whose
substance
ye
have
now
long
time
consumed
nor
palliative
have
yet
contrived
or
could
save
your
ambition
to
make
me
a
bride
attend
this
game
to
which
i
call
you
forth
now
suitors
prove
yourselves
with
this
huge
bow
of
ulysses
he
who
draws
easiest
the
bow
and
who
his
arrow
sends
through
twice
six
rings
he
takes
me
to
his
home
and
i
must
leave
this
mansion
of
my
youth
plenteous
magnificent
which
doubtless
oft
i
shall
remember
even
in
my
dreams
so
saying
she
bade
eumæus
lay
the
bow
before
them
and
the
twice
six
rings
of
steel
he
wept
received
them
and
obey
nor
wept
the
herdsman
less
seeing
the
bow
which
erst
his
lord
had
occupied
when
at
their
tears
indignant
thus
antinoüs
began
ye
rural
drones
whose
purblind
eyes
see
not
beyond
the
present
hour
egregious
fools
why
weeping
trouble
ye
the
queen
too
much
before
afflicted
for
her
husband
lost
either
partake
the
banquet
silently
or
else
go
weep
abroad
leaving
the
bow
that
stubborn
test
to
us
for
none
i
judge
none
here
shall
bend
this
polish
bow
with
ease
since
in
this
whole
assembly
i
discern
none
like
ulysses
whom
myself
have
seen
and
recollect
though
i
was
then
a
boy
he
said
but
in
his
heart
meantime
the
hope
cherish
that
he
should
bend
himself
the
bow
and
pass
the
rings
yet
was
he
destin
first
of
all
that
company
to
taste
the
steel
of
brave
ulysses
shaft
whom
in
that
house
he
had
so
oft
dishonour
and
had
urged
so
oft
all
others
to
the
like
offence
amidst
them
then
the
sacred
might
arose
of
young
telemachus
who
thus
began
saturnian
jove
questionless
hath
deprived
me
of
all
reason
my
own
mother
fam
for
wisdom
as
she
is
makes
known
to
all
her
purpose
to
abandon
this
abode
and
follow
a
new
mate
while
heedless
i
trifle
and
laugh
as
i
were
still
a
child
but
come
ye
suitors
since
the
prize
is
such
a
woman
like
to
whom
none
can
be
found
this
day
in
all
achaia
on
the
shores
of
sacred
pylus
in
the
cities
proud
of
argos
or
mycenæ
or
even
here
in
ithaca
or
yet
within
the
walls
of
black
epirus
and
since
this
yourselves
know
also
wherefore
should
i
speak
her
praise
come
then
delay
not
waste
not
time
in
vain
excuses
turn
not
from
the
proof
but
bend
the
bow
that
thus
the
issue
may
be
known
i
also
will
myself
that
task
essay
and
should
i
bend
the
bow
and
pass
the
rings
then
shall
not
my
illustrious
mother
leave
her
son
forlorn
forsaking
this
abode
to
follow
a
new
spouse
while
i
remain
disconsolate
although
of
age
to
bear
successful
as
my
sire
the
prize
away
so
saying
he
started
from
his
seat
cast
off
his
purple
cloak
and
lay
his
sword
aside
then
fix
himself
the
rings
furrowing
the
earth
by
line
and
one
long
trench
for
all
and
stamping
close
the
glebe
amazement
seized
all
present
seeing
with
how
prompt
a
skill
he
executed
though
untaught
his
task
then
hasting
to
the
portal
there
he
stood
thrice
struggling
he
essay
to
bend
the
bow
and
thrice
desisted
hoping
still
to
draw
the
home
and
shoot
through
all
the
rings
and
now
the
fourth
time
striving
with
full
force
he
had
prevail
to
string
it
but
his
sire
forbad
his
eager
efforts
by
a
sign
then
thus
the
royal
youth
to
all
around
gods
either
i
shall
prove
of
little
force
hereafter
and
for
manly
feats
unapt
or
i
am
yet
too
young
and
have
not
strength
to
quell
the
aggressor
contumely
but
come
for
ye
have
strength
surpassing
mine
try
ye
the
bow
and
bring
this
contest
to
an
end
he
ceas
and
set
the
bow
down
on
the
floor
reclining
it
against
the
shaven
pannels
smooth
that
lined
the
wall
the
arrow
next
he
placed
leaning
against
the
bow
horn
and
to
the
seat
whence
he
had
return
then
thus
eupithes
son
antinoüs
spake
my
friends
come
forth
successive
from
the
right
where
he
who
ministers
the
cup
begins
so
spake
antinoüs
and
his
counsel
pleased
then
first
leiodes
œnop
son
arose
he
was
their
soothsayer
and
ever
sat
beside
the
beaker
inmost
of
them
all
to
him
alone
of
all
licentious
deeds
were
odious
and
with
indignation
fired
he
witness
the
excesses
of
the
rest
he
then
took
foremost
up
the
shaft
and
bow
and
station
at
the
portal
strove
to
bend
but
bent
it
not
fatiguing
first
his
hands
delicate
and
uncustom
to
the
toil
he
ceased
and
the
assembly
thus
bespake
my
friends
i
speed
not
let
another
try
for
many
princes
shall
this
bow
of
life
bereave
since
death
more
eligible
seems
far
more
than
loss
of
her
for
whom
we
meet
continual
here
expecting
still
the
prize
some
suitor
haply
at
this
moment
hopes
that
he
shall
wed
whom
long
he
hath
desired
ulysses
wife
penelope
let
him
essay
the
bow
and
trial
made
address
his
spousal
offers
to
some
other
fair
among
the
princesses
of
greece
this
princess
leaving
his
whose
proffer
gifts
shall
please
her
most
and
whom
the
fates
ordain
he
said
and
set
the
bow
down
on
the
floor
reclining
it
against
the
shaven
pannels
smooth
that
lined
the
wall
the
arrow
next
he
placed
leaning
against

horn
and
to
the
seat
whence
he
had
return
then
him
antinoüs
angry
thus
reproved
what
word
leiodes
grating
to
our
ears
hath
scap
thy
lips
i
hear
it
with
disdain
shall
this
bow
fatal
prove
to
many
a
prince
because
thou
hast
thyself
too
feeble
proved
to
bend
it
no
thou
wast
not
born
to
bend
the
unpliant
bow
or
to
direct
the
shaft
but
here
are
nobler
who
shall
soon
prevail
he
said
and
to
melanthius
gave
command
the
hence
melanthius
kindle
fire
beside
it
place
with
fleeces
spread
a
form
of
length
commodious
from
within
procure
a
large
round
cake
of
suet
next
with
which
when
we
have
chafed
and
suppled
the
tough
bow
before
the
fire
we
will
again
essay
to
bend
it
and
decide
the
doubtful
strife
he
ended
and
melanthius
kindling
fire
beside
it
placed
with
fleeces
spread
a
form
of
length
commodious
next
he
brought
a
cake
ample
and
round
of
suet
from
within
with
which
they
chafed
the
bow
then
tried
again
to
bend
but
bent
it
not
superior
strength
to
theirs
that
task
required
yet
two
the
rest
in
force
surpassing
made
no
trial
yet
antinoüs
and
eurymachus
the
brave
then
went
the
herdsman
and
the
forth
together
after
whom
the
glorious
chief
himself
the
house
left
also
and
when
all
without
the
court
had
met
with
gentle
speech
ulysses
then
the
faithful
pair
address
herdsman
and
thou
eumæus
shall
i
keep
a
certain
secret
close
or
shall
i
speak
outright
my
spirit
prompts
me
and
i
will
what
welcome
should
ulysses
at
your
hands
receive
arriving
suddenly
at
home
some
god
his
guide
would
ye
the
suitors
aid
or
would
ye
aid
ulysses
answer
true
then
thus
the
chief
intendant
of
his
herds
would
jove
but
grant
me
my
desire
to
see
once
more
the
hero
and
would
some
kind
restore
him
i
would
shew
thee
soon
an
arm
strenuous
to
serve
him
and
a
dauntless
heart
eumæus
also
fervently
implored
the
gods
in
that
they
would
render
back
ulysses
to
his
home
he
then
convinced
of
their
unfeigning
honesty
began
behold
him
i
am
he
myself
arrived
after
long
in
the
twentieth
year
i
know
how
welcome
to
yourselves
alone
of
all
my
train
i
come
for
i
have
heard
none
others
praying
for
my
safe
return
i
therefore
tell
you
truth
should
subdue
the
suitors
under
me
ye
shall
receive
each
at
my
hands
a
bride
with
lands
and
house
near
to
my
own
and
ye
shall
be
thenceforth
dear
friends
and
brothers
of
the
prince
my
son
lo
also
this
indisputable
proof
that
ye
may
know
and
trust
me
view
it
here
it
is
the
scar
which
in
parnassus
erst
where
with
the
sons
i
hunted
of
autolycus
i
from
a
boar
received
so
saying
he
stripp
his
tatters
and
the
whole
broad
scar
then
soon
as
they
had
seen
and
surely
recognized
the
mark
each
cast
his
arms
around
ulysses
wept
embraced
and
press
him
to
his
bosom
kissing
oft
his
brows
and
shoulders
who
as
oft
their
hands
and
foreheads
kiss
nor
had
the
setting
sun
beheld
them
satisfied
but
that
himself
ulysses
thus
admonished
them
and
said
cease
now
from
tears
lest
any
coming
forth
mark
and
report
them
to
our
foes
within
now
to
the
hall
again
but
one
by
one
not
all
at
once
i
foremost
then
yourselves
and
this
shall
be
the
sign
full
well
i
know
that
all
unanimous
they
will
oppose
of
the
bow
and
shafts
to
me
but
thou
proceeding
with
it
to
my
seat
eumæus
noble
friend
shalt
give
the
bow
into
my
grasp
then
bid
the
women
close
the
massy
doors
and
should
they
hear
a
groan
or
other
noise
made
by
the
princes
shut
within
the
hall
let
none
set
step
abroad
but
all
work
silent
be
the
thy
charge
my
good
philœtius
key
it
fast
without
a
moment
pause
and
fix
the
brace
he
ended
and
returning
to
the
hall
resumed
his
seat
nor
stay
his
servants
long
without
but
follow
their
illustrious
lord
eurymachus
was
busily
turning
the
bow
and
chafing
it
before
the
sprightly
blaze
but
after
all
could
find
no
to
bend
it
disappointment
wrung
a
groan
from
his
proud
heart
and
thus
he
said
alas
not
only
for
myself
i
grieve
but
grieve
for
all
nor
though
i
mourn
the
loss
of
such
a
bride
mourn
i
that
loss
alone
for
lovely
greecians
may
be
found
no
few
in
ithaca
and
in
the
neighbour
isles
but
should
we
so
inferior
prove
at
last
to
brave
ulysses
that
no
force
of
ours
can
bend
his
bow
we
are
for
ever
shamed
to
whom
antinoüs
thus
eupithes
son
not
so
as
even
thou
art
thyself
eurymachus
but
phœbus
claims
this
day
his
own
who
then
on
such
a
day
would
strive
to
bend
it
let
it
rather
rest
and
should
we
leave
the
rings
where
now
they
stand
i
trust
that
none
ulysses
house
will
dare
displace
them
attend
serve
all
with
wine
that
first
libation
made
we
may
religiously
lay
down
the
bow
command
ye
too
melanthius
that
he
drive
hither
the
fairest
goats
of
all
his
flocks
at
dawn
of
day
that
burning
first
the
thighs
to
the
ethereal
archer
we
may
make
new
trial
and
decide
at
length
the
strife
so
spake
antinoüs
and
his
counsel
pleased
the
heralds
then
pour
water
on
their
hands
while
youths
crown
high
the
goblets
which
they
bore
from
right
to
left
distributing
to
all
when
each
had
made
libation
and
had
drunk
till
well
sufficed
then
artful
to
effect
his
shrewd
designs
ulysses
thus
began
hear
o
ye
suitors
of
the
illustrious
queen
my
bosom
dictates
but
i
shall
entreat
chiefly
eurymachus
and
the
godlike
youth
antinoüs
whose
advice
is
wisely
tamper
no
longer
with
the
bow
but
leave
the
matter
with
the
gods
who
shall
decide
the
strife
whom
they
will
meantime
grant
the
polish
bow
that
i
may
trial
make
among
you
of
my
force
if
i
retain
it
still
in
like
degree
as
erst
or
whether
and
defect
of
nourishment
have
worn
it
all
away
he
said
whom
they
with
indignation
heard
extreme
alarm
lest
he
should
bend
the
bow
and
sternly
thus
antinoüs
replied
desperate
vagabond
ah
wretch
deprived
of
reason
utterly
art
not
content
it
not
distinction
proud
enough
to
feast
with
us
the
nobles
of
the
land
none
robs
thee
of
thy
share
thou
witnessest
our
whole
discourse
which
save
thyself
alone
no
needy
vagrant
is
allow
to
hear
thou
art
befool
by
wine
as
many
have
been
drinkers
unrestrain
by
rule
wine
in
the
mansion
of
the
mighty
chief
pirithoüs
made
the
valiant
centaur
mad
eurytion
at
the
lapithæan
feast
he
drank
to
drunkenness
and
being
drunk
committed
great
enormities
beneath
pirithoüs
roof
and
such
as
fill
with
rage
the
who
therefore
by
his
feet
dragg
him
right
through
the
vestibule
amerced
of
nose
and
ears
and
he
departed
thence
provoked
to
frenzy
by
that
foul
disgrace
whence
war
between
the
human
kind
arose
and
the
bold
centaurs
but
he
first
incurred
by
his
ebriety
that
mulct
severe
great
evil
also
if
thou
bend
the
bow
to
thee
i
prophesy
for
thou
shalt
find
advocate
or
protector
none
in
all
this
people
but
we
will
dispatch
thee
hence
incontinent
on
board
a
sable
bark
to
echetus
the
scourge
of
human
kind
from
whom
is
no
escape
drink
then
in
peace
and
contest
shun
with
younger
men
than
thou
him
answer
then
penelope
discrete
antinoüs
neither
seemly
were
the
deed
nor
just
to
maim
or
harm
whatever
guest
whom
here
arrived
telemachus
receives
canst
thou
expect
that
should
he
even
prove
stronger
than
ye
and
bend
the
massy
bow
he
will
conduct
me
hence
to
his
own
home
and
make
me
his
own
bride
no
such
design
his
heart
conceives
or
hope
nor
let
a
dread
so
vain
the
mind
of
any
overcloud
who
banquets
here
since
it
dishonours
me
so
she
to
whom
eurymachus
reply
offspring
of
polybus
o
matchless
queen
icarius
prudent
daughter
none
suspects
that
thou
wilt
wed
with
him
a
mate
so
mean
should
ill
become
thee
but
we
fear
the
tongues
of
either
sex
lest
some
achaian
say
hereafter
one
inferior
far
to
us
ah
how
unworthy
are
they
to
compare
with
him
whose
wife
they
seek
to
bend
his
bow
pass
all
their
yet
this
poor
vagabond
arriving
from
what
country
none
can
tell
bent
it
with
ease
and
shot
through
all
the
rings
so
will
they
speak
and
so
shall
we
be
shamed
then
answer
thus
penelope
return
no
fair
report
eurymachus
attends
their
names
or
can
who
riotous
as
ye
the
house
dishonour
and
consume
the
wealth
of
such
a
chief
why
shame
ye
thus
the
guest
is
of
athletic
frame
well
form
and
large
of
limb
he
boasts
him
also
sprung
from
noble
ancestry
come
then
consent
give
him
the
bow
that
we
may
see
the
proof
for
thus
i
say
and
thus
will
i
perform
sure
as
he
bends
it
and
apollo
gives
to
him
that
glory
tunic
fair
and
cloak
shall
be
his
meed
from
me
a
javelin
keen
to
guard
him
against
men
and
dogs
a
sword
of
double
edge
and
sandals
for
his
feet
and
i
will
send
him
whither
most
he
would
her
answer
then
prudent
telemachus
mother
the
bow
is
mine
and
save
myself
no
greek
hath
right
to
give
it
or
refuse
none
who
in
ithaca
possess
dominion
none
in
the
isles
of
elis
if
i
chose
to
make
the
bow
his
own
for
ever
should
that
choice
controul
but
thou
into
the
house
repairing
ply
spindle
and
loom
thy
province
and
enjoin
diligence
to
thy
maidens
for
the
bow
is
man
concern
alone
and
shall
be
mine
especially
since
i
am
master
here
she
heard
astonish
and
the
prudent
speech
reposing
of
her
son
deep
in
her
heart
withdrew
then
mounting
with
her
female
train
to
her
superior
chamber
there
she
wept
her
lost
ulysses
till
minerva
bathed
with
balmy
dews
of
sleep
her
weary
lids
and
now
the
noble
bore
the
bow
toward
ulysses
but
with
one
voice
all
the
suitors
clamorous
reproved
the
deed
of
whom
a
youth
thus
insolent
exclaim
thou
clumsy
whither
the
bow
delirious
wretch
the
hounds
that
thou
hast
shall
eat
thee
at
thy
solitary
home
ere
long
let
but
apollo
prove
at
last
propitious
to
us
and
the
of
so
they
whom
hearing
he
replaced
the
bow
where
erst
it
stood
terrified
at
the
sound
of
such
loud
menaces
on
the
other
side
telemachus
as
loud
assail
his
ear
friend
forward
with
the
bow
or
soon
repent
that
thou
the
many
i
will
else
with
huge
stones
drive
thee
younger
as
i
am
back
to
the
field
my
strength
surpasses
thine
i
would
to
that
i
in
force
as
far
and
prowess
every
suitor
here
so
would
i
soon
give
rude
dismission
hence
to
some
who
live
but
to
imagine
harm
he
ceased
whose
words
the
suitors
laughing
heard
and
for
their
sake
in
part
their
wrath
against
telemachus
then
through
the
hall
eumæus
bore
and
to
ulysses
hand
consign
the
bow
next
summoning
abroad
the
ancient
nurse
he
gave
her
thus
in
charge
it
is
the
pleasure
of
telemachus
sage
euryclea
that
thou
key
secure
the
doors
and
should
you
hear
perchance
a
groan
or
other
noise
made
by
the
princes
shut
within
the
hall
let
none
look
curious
forth
but
each
in
quietness
pursue
her
work
so
he
nor
flew
his
words
useless
away
but
she
incontinent
shut
fast
the
doors
then
noiseless
sprang
philœtius
forth
who
closed
the
portals
also
of
the
a
of
ægyptian
reed
it
chanced
lay
in
the
vestibule
with
that
he
braced
the
doors
securely
and
again
his
seat
but
watchful
eyed
his
lord
he
now
assaying
with
his
hand
the
bow
made
curious
trial
of
it
way
and
turn
it
on
all
sides
lest
haply
worms
had
in
its
master
absence
drill
the
horn
then
thus
a
suitor
to
his
next
remark
he
hath
an
eye
methinks
exactly
in
bows
and
steals
them
or
perhaps
at
home
hath
such
himself
or
feels
a
strong
desire
to
make
them
so
inquisitive
the
rogue
adept
in
mischief
shifts
it
to
and
fro
to
whom
another
insolent
replied
i
wish
him
like
prosperity
in
all
his
efforts
as
attends
his
effort
made
on
this
same
bow
which
he
shall
never
bend
so
they
but
when
the
wary
hero
wise
had
made
his
hand
familiar
with
the
bow
poising
it
and
examining
at
once
as
when
in
harp
and
song
adept
a
bard
strains
the
chord
to
a
new
lyre
the
twisted
entrails
of
a
sheep
below
with
fingers
nice
inserting
and
above
with
such
facility
ulysses
bent
his
own
huge
bow
and
with
his
right
hand
the
nerve
which
in
its
quick
vibration
sang
clear
as
the
swallow
voice
keen
anguish
seized
the
suitors
wan
grew
cheek
and
jove
gave
him
his
rolling
thunder
for
a
sign
that
omen
granted
to
him
by
the
son
of
wily
saturn
with
delight
he
heard
he
took
a
shaft
that
at
the
lay
ready
drawn
but
in
his
quiver
womb
the
rest

a

very
different
from

with

we

i
believe
is
exact
this

not

to

this

to
have
been
a

the

an

of
the

as

at

aimed

purposing

advanced
toward

at

yet

no

thou
never

none

thus
ulysses
louring

replied
o

not

my
safe

from

ye
have
shorn
my

to
make
my

yours
heedless
of
the

of

death
is

death
for

faded
at
the
sound
and
each
with
sharpen

search
nook
for
an
escape
from
his
impending
doom
till
thus
alone
eurymachus
replied
if
thou
indeed
art
he
the
mighty
chief
of
ithaca
return
thou
hast
with
truth
the
crimes
committed
by
the
greeks
frequent
both
in
thy
house
and
in
thy
field
but

already
who
was

of

he
thy

far
framing

saturnian
jove
hath
baffled
all
to
rule

supreme
in

thy

is
slain
now
therefore
spare

public
reparation
due
shall
sure
be
thine
and
to
appease
thy
wrath
for
all
the
waste
that
eating
drinking
here
we
have
committed
we
will
yield
thee
each
full
twenty
beeves
gold
paying
thee

brass
till
joy
shall
fill
thee
at
the
sight
however
just
thine
anger
was
before
to
whom
ulysses
frowning
stern
replied
eurymachus
would
ye
contribute
each
his
whole
inheritance
and
other
sums
still
add
beside
ye
should
not
even
so
these
hands
of

bribe
to
abstain
from

till

suffer
for
his

ye
have
your
choice
fight
with
me
or
escape
whoever
may
the
terrours
of
his
fate
but
ye
all
perish
if
my
thought
be
true
he
ended
they
with
trembling
knees
and
hearts
all
heard
whom
thus
eurymachus
address
to
your
defence
my
friends
for
respite
none
will
he
to
his
victorious
hands
afford
but
arm
with
bow
and
quiver
will
dispatch
shafts
from
the
door
till
he
have
slain
us
all
therefore
to
arms
draw
each
his
sword
oppose
the
tables
to
his
shafts
and
all
at
once
rush
on
him
that
dislodging
him
at
least
from
portal
and
from
threshold
we
may
give
the
city
on
all
sides
a
loud
alarm
so
shall
this
archer
soon
have
shot
his
last
thus
saying
he
drew
his
brazen
faulchion
keen
of
double
edge
and
with
a
dreadful
cry
sprang
on
him
but
ulysses
with
a
shaft
in
that
same
moment
through
his
bosom
transfix
his
liver
and
down
dropp
his
sword
he
staggering
around
his
table
fell
convolv
in
agonies
and
both
food
and
wine
his
forehead
smote
the
floor
woe
fill
his
heart
and
spurning
with
his
heels
his
vacant
seat
he
shook
it
till
he
died
then
with
his
faulchion
drawn
amphinomus
advanced
to
drive
ulysses
from
the
door
and
fierce
was
his
assault
but
from
behind
telemachus
between
his
shoulders
a
brazen
lance
and
urged
it
through
his
breast
full
on
his
front
with
hideous
sound
he
fell
leaving
the
weapon
planted
in
his
spine
back
flew
telemachus
lest
had
he
stood
drawing
it
forth
some
enemy
perchance
should
either
pierce
him
with
a
sudden
thrust
oblique
or
hew
him
with
a
downright
edge
swift
therefore
to
his
father
side
he
ran
whom
reaching
in
wing
accents
thus
he
said
my
father
i
will
now
bring
thee
a
shield
an
helmet
and
two
spears
i
will
enclose
myself
in
armour
also
and
will
give
both
to
the
herdsmen
and
eumæus
arms
expedient
now
and
needful
for
us
all
to
whom
ulysses
replied
run
fetch
them
while
i
yet
have
arrows
left
lest
single
i
be
justled
from
the
door
he
said
and
at
his
word
forth
went
the
prince
seeking
the
chamber
where
he
had
secured
the
armour
thence
he
took
four
shields
eight
spears
with
four
helmets
charged
with
which
he
hasted
to
his
father
side
again
and
arming
first
himself
furnish
with
arms
his
two
attendants
then
all
clad
alike
in
splendid
brass
beside
the
dauntless
chief
ulysses
his
auxiliars
firm
they
stood
he
while
a
single
arrow
lay
at
his
foot
ever
pierced
some
suitor
through
and
heaps
on
heaps
they
fell
but
when
his
arrows
fail
the
royal
chief
his
bow
reclining
at
the
portal
side
against
the
he
slung
himself
a
buckler
on
his
arm
he
a
casque
whose
crest
wav
awful
his
brows
on
his
illustrious
head
and
fill
his
gripe
with
two
stout
spears
both
with
brass
there
was
a
certain
postern
in
the
wall
at
the
the
customary
pass
into
a
narrow
street
but
barr
secure
ulysses
bade
his
faithful
watch
that
egress
station
near
it
for
it
one
sole
approach
then
agelaüs
loud
exhorting
all
the
suitors
thus
exclaim
oh
friends
will
none
ascending
to
the
door
of
yonder
postern
summon
to
our
aid
the
populace
and
spread
a
wide
alarm
so
shall
this
archer
soon
have
shot
his
last
to
whom
the
keeper
of
the
goats
replied
melanthius
agelaüs
prince
renown
that
may
not
be
the
postern
and
the
gate
neighbour
too
near
each
other
and
to
force
the
narrow
egress
were
a
vain
attempt
one
valiant
man
might
thence
repulse
us
all
but
come
myself
will
furnish
you
with
arms
fetch
from
above
for
there
as
i
suppose
and
not
elsewhere
ulysses
and
his
son
have
hidden
them
and
there
they
shall
be
found
so
spake
melanthius
and
ascending
sought
ulysses
chambers
through
the
winding
stairs
and
of
the
house
twelve
bucklers
thence
he
took
as
many
spears
and
helmets
bright
as
many
shagg
with
hair
then
swift
and
gave
them
to
his
friends
trembled
the
heart
of
brave
ulysses
and
his
knees
at
sight
of
his
opposers
putting
armour
on
and
shaking
each
his
spear
arduous
indeed
now
seem
his
task
and
in
wing
accents
brief
thus
to
his
son
telemachus
he
spake
either
some
woman
of
our
train
contrives
hard
battle
for
us
furnishing
with
arms
the
suitors
or
melanthius
arms
them
all
him
answer
then
telemachus
discrete
father
this
fault
was
mine
and
be
it
charged
on
none
beside
i
left
the
unbarr
which
more
attentive
than
myself
their
spy
perceived
but
haste
eumæus
shut
the
observing
well
the
while
if
any
women
of
our
train
have
done
this
deed
or
whether
as
i
more
suspect
melanthius
dolius
son
have
them
arms
thus
mutual
they
conferr
meantime
again
melanthius
to
the
chamber
flew
in
quest
of
other
arms
eumæus
as
he
went
mark
him
and
to
ulysses
thus
he
spake
laertes
noble
son
for
wiles
renown
behold
the
traytor
whom
ourselves
supposed
seeks
yet
again
the
chamber
tell
me
plain
shall
i
should
i
superior
prove
in
force
slay
him
or
shall
i
drag
him
thence
to
thee
that
he
may
suffer
at
thy
hands
the
doom
due
to
his
treasons
perpetrated
oft
against
thee
here
even
in
thy
own
house
then
answer
thus
ulysses
shrewd
return
i
with
telemachus
will
here
immew
the
lordly
suitors
close
rage
as
they
may
ye
two
the
while
bind
fast
melanthius
hands
and
feet
behind
his
back
then
cast
him
bound
into
the
chamber
and
the
door
secured
pass
underneath
his
arms
a
double
chain
and
by
a
pillar
top
weigh
him
aloft
till
he
approach
the
rafters
there
to
endure
living
long
time
the
he
hath
earned
he
spake
they
prompt
obey
together
both
they
sought
the
chamber
whom
the
wretch
within
heard
not
exploring
nook
for
arms
they
watching
stood
the
door
from
which
at
length
forth
came
melanthius
bearing
in
one
hand
a
casque
and
in
the
other
a
broad
shield
and
chapp
with
drought
which
in
his
youth
warlike
laertes
had
been
wont
to
bear
long
time
neglected
it
had
lain
till
age
had
loosed
the
sutures
of
its
bands
at
once
both
springing
on
him
seized
and
drew
him
in
forcibly
by
his
locks
then
cast
him
down
prone
on
the
pavement
trembling
at
his
fate
with
painful
stricture
of
the
cord
his
hands
they
bound
and
feet
together
at
his
back
as
their
illustrious
master
had
enjoined
then
weigh
him
with
a
double
chain
aloft
by
a
tall
pillar
to
the
and
thus
deriding
him
eumæus
spake
now
good
melanthius
on
that
fleecy
bed
reclined
as
well
befits
thee
thou
wilt
watch
all
night
nor
when
the
golden
dawn
forsakes
the
ocean
stream
will
she
escape
thine
eye
but
thou
wilt
duly
to
the
palace
drive
the
fattest
goats
a
banquet
for
thy
friends
so
saying
he
left
him
in
his
dreadful
sling
then
arming
both
and
barring
fast
the
door
they
sought
brave
laertiades
again
and
now
courageous
at
the
portal
stood
those
four
by
numbers
in
the
interior
house
opposed
of
adversaries
fierce
in

when
pallas
in

with
the

joyful
at

exclaim

the

the

beware

all

flew
the

to
the
farthest
wall
on
whom
those
valiant
four
advancing
each
recover
quick
his
weapon
from
the

then
hurl
the

yet
again
their
spears
but
pallas
gave
to
each
a
frustrate
course
one
struck
a

and
now
the

dauntless

all
hurl
their

together

in

the

he
cried
oh

whose

hath
been
to

never

boast
foolishly
but
to
the

commit
thy

since
they
are

for
thy

of
hospitality
the
huge
which
while

roam
the

begging

ulysses
at
thy
bounteous

received
so
gloried
he
then
grasping

and
next
telemachus
enforcing
his
long

sheer
through
his

transpierced
leiocritus
he
prostrate
smote
the

then

from
the
lofty
roof
held
forth
her
ægis
their

their

with
fear
they
through
the

fled
scatter
as
an
herd
which
the
dissipates
infester
fell
of
beeves
when
vernal
suns
shine
hot
and
long
but
as
when
vultures
stoop
from
the
mountains
on
the
smaller
fowl
terrified
at
the
toils
that
spread
the
plain
the

take
wing
they
darting
from

strike
seize

resistance
or

is
none
the

leaps
with

so
they
pursuing
through
the
spacious
hall
the

smote
them
on
all
sides
their
heads
sounded
beneath
the
sword
with
hideous
groans
the
palace
rang
and
the
floor
foamed
with
blood
then
flew
leiodes
to
ulysses
knees
which
clasping
in
wing
accents
thus
he
cried
i
clasp
thy
knees
ulysses
oh
respect
my
suit
and
spare
me
never
have
i
word
injurious
spoken
or
injurious
deed
attempted
the
women
of
thy
house
but
others
so
transgressing
oft
forbad
yet
they
abstain
not
and
a
dreadful
fate
due
to
their
wickedness
have
therefore
found
but
i
their
soothsayer
alone
must
fall
though
unoffending
such
is
the
return
by
mortals
made
for
benefits
received
to
whom
ulysses
louring
dark
replied
is
that
thy
boast
hast
thou
indeed
for
these
the
seer
high
office
fill
then
doubtless
oft
thy
hath
been
that
distant
far
might
prove
the
day
delectable
of
my
return
and
that
my
consort
might
thy
own
become
to
bear
thee
children
wherefore
thee
i
doom
to
a
dire
death
which
thou
shalt
not
avoid
so
saying
he
caught
the
faulchion
from
the
floor
which
agelaüs
had
let
fall
and
smote
leiodes
while
he
kneel
athwart
his
neck
so
suddenly
that
ere
his
tongue
had
ceased
to
plead
for
life
his
head
was
in
the
dust
but
phemius
son
of
terpius
bard
divine
who
through
compulsion
with
his
song
regaled
the
suitors
a
like
dreadful
death
escaped
fast
by
the
postern
harp
in
hand
he
stood
doubtful
if
issuing
he
should
take
his
seat
beside
the
altar
of
hercæan
jove
where
oft
ulysses
offer
and
his
sire
fat
thighs
of
beeves
or
whether
he
should
haste
an
earnest
suppliant
to
embrace
his
knees
that
course
at
length
most
pleased
him
then
between
the
beaker
and
an
throne
he
grounded
his
sweet
lyre
and
seizing
fast
the

him
suppliant
thus
address
i
clasp
thy

ulysses
oh
respect
my

and
spare
me
thou
shalt
not

regret
thyself
hereafter
if
thou

me
charmer
of
the
woes
of

i
and
treasure
in
my

themes
of
all
argument
from

and
i
can
sing
to
thee
as
to

ah
then
behead
me
not
put
the
wish
far
from
thee
for
thy
own
beloved
son
can
witness
that
not
drawn
by
choice
or
by
stress
of
want
resorting
to
thine
house
i
have
regaled
these
revellers
so
oft
but
under
force
of
mightier
far
than
i
so

whose
words
soon
as
the

might
heard
of

approaching
quick
his

thus
humane
he
interposed
hold
harm
not
with
the
vengeful
faulchion
edge
this
blameless
man
and
we
will
also
spare
medon
the
herald
who
hath
ever
been
a
watchful
guardian
of
my
boyish
years
unless
philœtius
have
already
slain
him
or
else
eumæus
or
thyself
perchance
unconscious
in
the
tumult
of
our
foes
he
spake
whom
medon
hearing
for
he
lay
beneath
a
throne
and
in
a
hide
enfolded
trembling
with
the
dread
of
death
sprang
from
his
and
casting
off
the
skin
flew
to
telemachus
embraced
his
knees
and
in
wing
accents
thus
exclaim
prince
i
am
here
oh
pity
me
repress
thine
own
and
pacify
thy
father
wrath
that
he
destroy
not
me
through
fierce
revenge
of
their
iniquities
who
have
consumed
his
wealth
and
in
their
folly
scorn
his
son
to
whom
ulysses
replied
smiling
complacent
fear
not
my
own
son
hath
pleaded
for
thee
therefore
taught
thyself
that
truth
teach
others
the
superior
worth
of
benefits
with
injuries
compared
but
go
ye
forth
thou
and
the
sacred
bard
that
ye
may
sit
distant
in
yonder
court
from
all
this
carnage
while
i
give
command
myself
concerning
it
to
those
within
he
ceas
they
going
forth
took
each
his
seat
beside
jove
altar
but
with
careful
looks
suspicious
dreading
without
cease
the
sword
meantime
ulysses
search
his
hall
in
quest
of
living
foes
if
any
still
survived
unpunish
but
he
found
them
all
alike
in
dust
and
blood
they
lay
like
fishes
when
they
strew
the
sinuous
shore
of
ocean
from
the
grey
gulph
drawn
aground
in
nets
of
many
a

they
on
the
sands
lie
spread
athirst
for
the
salt
wave
till
hot
the
gazing
sun
dries
all
their
life
away
so
lay
the
suitors
heap
and
thus
at
length
the
prudent
chief
gave
order
to
his
son
telemachus
bid
euryclea
come
quickly
the
nurse
to
whom
i
would
impart
the
purpose
which
now
occupies
me
most
he
said
obedient
to
his

the
prince
smote
on
the
door
and
summon

the

arise
thou
ancient
governess
of

menials
and
come
forth
attend
my

he
hath
somewhat

thine

so
he
nor
flew
his
words
useless
away
for
throwing
wide
the
portal
forth
she
came
and
by
telemachus
conducted
found
ere
long
ulysses
amid
all
the
slain
with

forcible
to
publish
loud
that
triumph
but
her

the

to

respecting
neither

the

thy

so
lately
no

thus
ulysses

returned
hush
and
disturb

not
go
summon
first
those
wantons
who
have
long
deserved
to

he

then
issued
forth
the
ancient

to
summon
those
bad
women
and
meantime
calling
his

philœtius
and

ulysses
in

thus
began

and
with

all

when
ye
shall

thus
set
all
in

those

forth
and
in

faulchions
till
they
lose
in

the
of
their
secret

the

at

with
tepid
tears
the

with
mutual
labour
first
bearing
the
bodies
forth
into
the
court
they
lodged
them
in
the
portico
meantime
ulysses
stern
enjoin
them
haste
and
urged
by
sad
necessity
they
bore
all
out
with
sponges
and
with
water
next
they
cleansed
the
thrones
and

while
telemachus
beesom

the

next
led
forth
the

they
shut
between

in
close
durance
from
which
no
could
escape
and
thus
telemachus
discrete
began
an
honourable
death
is
not
for
these
by
my
advice
who
have
so
often
reproach
on

on
my

and
held

with
the
he
said
and
noosing
a

to
an
huge

led
the

around
the
spacious

suspended
so
aloft
that
none
with

when

awhile
they
beat
the

then
ceas
and
now
through
vestibule
and
hall
they
led
melanthius
forth
with
ruthless
steel
they
pared
away
his
ears
and
nose
pluck
forth
his
parts
of
shame
destin
to
feed
the

and
still
indignant
lopp
his

then
laving
each
his

they
sought
again
ulysses
all
their

done

thus
the

spake
bring

bring
fire
that

fumigate
my

then
bid
penelope
with
her
attendants
down
and
summon
all
the

train
but
euryclea
thus
his

replied
my

thou

well
said

serve
thee
with

stand
not
here
in

foul

then

thus
ulysses

return
not
so
bring
fire
for
fumigation
first
he
said
nor
euryclea
his

delay
but
sulphur
brought
and
fire
when

with
purifying

his

magnificent
the
matron
the
women
to
attend
their

in

they
attended
bearing

a

then
gather
they
around
him
all
sincere
welcoming
his
return
with
close
embrace
enfolding
him
each
kiss
his
brows
and
each
his
shoulders
and
his
hands
lock
fast
in

irresistible
the

felt

we
the

given
it
the

other
to
the

to
which
telemachus
went
for

there
was

perhaps
on

they

at
some
height
above
the

at
which
ulysses

the

described
which
must
be
understood
therefore
as
instances
of
the

desire
is
come

hath
to
his
household
gods
alive
return
thee
and
his
son
he
finds
unharm
and
at
your
home
nor
hath
he
left
unpunish
one
of
all
his
enemies
her
answer
then
penelope
discrete
ah
dearest
nurse
indulge
not
to
excess
this
triumph
thou
art
well
apprized
how
welcome
his
appearance
here
would
prove
to
all
but
chief
to
me
and
to
his
son
fruit
of
our
love
but
these
things
are
not
so
some
god
resentful
of
their
evil
deeds
and
of
their
biting
contumely
severe
hath
slain
those
proud
for
whether
noble
guest
arrived
or
base
alike
they
scoff
at
all
and
for
their
wickedness
have
therefore
died
but
my
ulysses
distant
far
i
know
from
greece
hath
perish
and
returns
no
more
to
whom
thus
euryclea
nurse
belov
what
word
my
daughter
had
escaped
thy
lips
who
thus
thy
husband
now
within
and
at
his
own
for
ever
lost
canst
thou
be
thus
incredulous
hear
again
i
give
thee
yet
proof
past
dispute
his
scar
imprinted
by
a
tusk
laving
him
i
remark
it
and
desired
myself
to
tell
thee
but
he
compressing
with
both
hands
my
lips
forbad
come
follow
me
my
life
shall
be
the
pledge
if
i
deceive
thee
kill
me
as
thou
wilt
to
whom
penelope
discrete
replied
ah
dearest
nurse
sagacious
as
thou
art
thou
little
to
scan
the
counsels
wise
of
the
eternal
gods
but
let
us
seek
my
son
however
that
i
may
behold
the
suitors
dead
and
him
by
whom
they
died
so
saying
she
left
her
chamber
musing
much
in
her
descent
whether
to
interrogate
her
lord
apart
or
whether
to
imprint
at
once
his
hands
with
kisses
and
his
brows
light
the
of
stone
she
enter
he
sat
opposite
illumed
by
the
hearth
sprightly
blaze
and
close
before
a
pillar
of
the
dome
waiting
with
eyes
downcast
till
viewing
him
his
noble
spouse
should
speak
to
him
but
she
sat
silent
long
her
faculties
in
mute
amazement
held
by
turns
she
riveted
her
eyes
on
his
and
seeing
him
so
foul
attired
by
turns
she
recognized
him
not
then
spake
her
son
telemachus
and
her
silence
thus
reprov
my
mother
ah
my
hapless
and
my
most
obdurate
mother
wherefore
thus
aloof
thou
my
father
neither
at
his
side
sitting
affectionate
nor
word
another
wife
lives
not
who
could
endure
such
distance
from
her
husband
to
his
own
country
in
the
twentieth
year
after
much
hardship
but
thy
heart
is
still
as
ever
less
impressible
than
stone
to
whom
penelope
discrete
replied
i
am
all
wonder
o
my
son
my
soul
is
stunn
within
me
to
speak
to
him
or
to
interrogate
him
have
i
none
or
to
look
on
him
but
if
indeed
he
be
ulysses
and
have
reach
his
home
i
shall
believe
it
soon
by
proof
convinced
of
signs
known
only
to
himself
and
me
she
said
then
smiled
the
hero
and
in
wing
accents
thus
spake
to
his
son
leave
thou
telemachus
thy
mother
here
to
sift
and
prove
me
she
will
know
me
soon
more
certainly
she
sees
me
and
squalid
now
therefore
she
shews
me
scorn
and
no
belief
hath
yet
that
i
am
he
but
we
have
need
thou
and
myself
of
deep
deliberation
if
a
man
have
slain
one
only
citizen
who
leaves
behind
few
interested
to
avenge
his
death
yet
flying
he
forsakes
both
friends
and
home
but
we
have
slain
the
noblest
princes
far
of
ithaca
on
whom
our
city
most
depended
therefore
i
advise
thee
think
him
prudent
then
answer
telemachus
be
that
thy
care
my
father
for
report
proclaims
shrewdest
of
mankind
with
whom
in
ingenuity
may
none
compare
lead
thou
to
follow
thee
shall
be
our
part
with
prompt
alacrity
nor
shall
i
judge
courage
be
wanting
to
our
utmost
force
thus
then
replied
ulysses
to
me
the
safest
counsel
and
the
best
seems
this
first
wash
yourselves
and
put
ye
on
your
tunics
bid
ye
next
the
maidens
take
their
best
attire
and
let
the
bard
divine
harping
melodious
play
a
sportive
dance
that
whether
passenger
or
neighbour
near
all
may
imagine
nuptials
held
within
so
shall
not
loud
report
that
we
have
slain
all
those
alarm
the
city
till
we
gain
our
woods
and
fields
where
once
arriv
such
plans
we
will
devise
as
jove
shall
deign
to
inspire
he
spake
and
all
obedient
in
the
bath
first
laved
themselves
then
put
their
tunics
on
the
damsels
also
dress
and
the
sweet
bard
harping
melodious
kindled
strong
desire
in
all
of
jocund
song
and
graceful
dance
the
palace
under
all
its
vaulted
roof
remurmur
to
the
feet
of
sportive
youths
and
cinctured
maidens
while
no
few
abroad
hearing
such
revelry
within
remark
the
queen
with
many
wooers
weds
at
last
ah
fickle
and
unworthy
fair
too
frail
always
to
keep
inviolate
the
house
of
her
first
lord
and
wait
for
his
return
so
spake
the
people
but
they
little
knew
what
had
eurynome
meantime
with
bath
and
unction
serv
the
illustrious
chief
ulysses
and
he
saw
himself
attired
royally
once
again
in
his
own
house
then
pallas
over
all
his
features
shed
superior
beauty
dignified
his
form
with
added
amplitude
and
pour
his
curls
like
hyacinthine
down
from
his
brows
as
when
some
artist
by
minerva
made
and
vulcan
wise
to
execute
all
tasks
ingenious
borders
silver
with
a
wreath
of
gold
accomplishing
a
graceful
work
such
grace
the
goddess
his
ample
chest
copious
diffused
and
his
manly
brows
he
godlike
stepping
from
the
bath
resumed
his
former
seat
magnificent
and
sat
opposite
to
the
queen
to
whom
he
said
penelope
the
gods
to
thee
have
of
all
thy
sex
the
most
obdurate
heart
another
wife
lives
not
who
could
endure
such
distance
from
her
husband
to
his
own
country
in
the
twentieth
year
after
such
hardship
but
prepare
me
nurse
a
bed
for
solitary
i
must
sleep
since
she
is
iron
and
feels
not
for
me
him
answer
then
prudent
penelope
i
neither
magnify
thee
sir
nor
yet
depreciate
thee
nor
is
my
wonder
such
as
hurries
me
at
once
into
thy
arms
though
my
remembrance
perfectly
retains
such
as
he
was
ulysses
when
he
on
board
his
bark
from
ithaca
go
nurse
prepare
his
bed
but
not
within
the
walls
of
his
own
chamber
built
with
his
own
hands
spread
it
without
and
spread
it
well
with
warm
mantles
with
fleeces
and
with
richest
rugs
so
spake
she
proving
him
and
not
with
anger
at
that
word
thus
he
replied
penelope
that
order
grates
my
ear
who
hath
displaced
my
bed
the
task
were
hard
to
an
artist
other
than
a
god
none
might
with
ease
remove
it
as
for
man
it
might
defy
the
stoutest
in
his
prime
of
youth
to
heave
it
to
a
different
spot
for
in
that
bed
elaborate
a
sign
a
special
sign
consists
i
was
myself
the
artificer
i
fashion
it
alone
within
the
court
a
leafy
olive
grew
lofty
luxuriant
in
girth
around
this
tree
i
built
with
massy
stones
cemented
close
my
chamber
roof
it
and
hung
the
glutinated
portals
on
i
lopp
the
ample
foliage
and
the
boughs
and
near
the
root
its
solid
bole
smooth
all
the
rugged
stump
with
skilful
hand
and
wrought
it
to
a
pedestal
well
squared
and
modell
by
the
line
i
wimbled
next
the
frame
throughout
and
from
the
beginning
fashion
the
whole
bed
above
till
all
was
finish
plated
with
gold
with
silver
and
with
ivory
and
beneath
close
interlaced
with
purple
cordage
strong
such
sign
i
give
thee
but
if
still
it
stand
unmoved
or
if
some
other
sheer
the
olive
from
its
bottom
have
displaced
my
bed
that
matter
is
best
known
to
thee
he
ceas
she
conscious
of
the
sign
so
plain
by
ulysses
heard
with
heart
and
knees
that
proof
weeping
she
ran
direct
toward
him
threw
her
arms
around
the
hero
kiss
his
forehead
and
replied
ah
my
ulysses
pardon
me
frown
not
thou
who
at
other
times
hast
ever
shewn
superior
wisdom
all
our
griefs
have
from
the
gods
will
they
envied
us
the
bliss
of
undivided
union
sweet
through
life
from
early
youth
to
latest
age
no
be
not
angry
now
pardon
the
fault
that
i
embraced
thee
not
as
soon
as
seen
for
horror
hath
not
ceased
to
overwhelm
my
soul
lest
some
false
alien
should
perchance
beguile
me
for
our
house
draws
such
jove
daughter
argive
helen
had
given
free
entertainment
to
a
stranger
love
had
she
foreknown
that
the
heroic
sons
of
greece
would
bring
her
to
her
home
again
but
incited
her
to
that
offence
who
never
else
had
even
in
her
thought
harbour
the
foul
enormity
from
which
originated
even
our
distress
but
now
since
evident
thou
hast
described
our
bed
which
never
mortal
yet
beheld
ourselves
except
and
actoris
my
own
attendant
me
when
i
left
my
home
by
good
icarius
and
who
kept
the
door
though
hard
to
be
convinced
at
last
i
yield
so
saying
she
awaken
in
his
soul
pity
and
grief
and
folding
in
his
arms
his
blameless
consort
beautiful
he
wept
welcome
as
land
appears
to
those
who
swim
whose
gallant
bark
neptune
with
rolling
waves
and
stormy
winds
hath
sunk
in
the
wide
sea
a
mariner
or
two
perchance
escape
the
foamy
flood
and
swimming
reach
the
land
weary
indeed
and
with
incrusted
brine
all
rough
but
oh
how
glad
to
climb
the
coast
so
welcome
in
her
eyes
ulysses
seem
around
whose
neck
winding
her
snowy
arms
she
clung
as
she
would
loose
him
never
more
thus
had
they
wept
till
morn
had
found
them
weeping
but
minerva
night
almost
finish
course
and
held
meantime
the
golden
dawn
close
in
the
deep
forbidding
her
to
lead
her
coursers
forth
lampus
and
phaëton
that
furnish
light
to
all
the
earth
and
join
them
to
the
yoke
then
thus
ulysses
to
penelope
my
love
we
have
not
yet
attain
the
close
of
all
our
sufferings
but
unmeasured
toil
arduous
remains
which
i
must
still
atchieve
for
so
the
spirit
of
the
theban
seer
inform
me
on
that
day
when
to
enquire
of
mine
and
of
my
people
safe
return
i
journey
down
to
pluto
drear
abode
but
let
us
hence
to
bed
there
to
enjoy
tranquil
repose
my
love
make
no
delay
him
answer
then
prudent
penelope
thou
shalt
to
bed
at
whatsoever
time
thy
soul
desires
since
the
immortal
gods
give
thee
to
me
and
to
thy
home
again
but
thou
hast
spoken
from
the
seer
of
thebes
of
arduous
toils
yet
unperform
declare
what
toils
thou
wilt
disclose
them
as
i
judge
hereafter
and
why
not
disclose
them
now
to
whom
ulysses
replied
ah
conversant
with
woe
why
thou
learn
that
tale
but
i
will
tell
it
thee
at
large
thou
wilt
not
hear
with
joy
nor
shall
myself
with
joy
rehearse
it
for
he
bade
me
seek
city
after
city
bearing
as
i
go
a
shapely
oar
till
i
shall
find
at
length
a
people
who
the
sea
know
not
nor
eat
food
salted
they
trim
galley
have
beheld
nor
yet
oar
with
which
the
vessel
wing
scuds
the
waves
he
gave
me
also
this
authentic
sign
which
i
will
tell
thee
in
what
place
i
chance
to
meet
a
who
shall
name
the
oar
on
my
broad
shoulder
borne
a
van
he
bade
me
planting
it
on
the
same
spot
worship
the
king
of
ocean
with
a
bull
a
ram
and
a
lascivious
boar
then
seek
my
home
again
and
sacrifice
at
home
an
hecatomb
to
the
immortal
gods
inhabitants
of
the
expanse
above
so
shall
i
die
at
length
the
gentlest
death
remote
from
ocean
it
shall
find
me
late
in
soft
serenity
of
age
the
chief
of
a
blest
thus
he
prophesied
him
answer
then
penelope
discrete
if
appoint
thee
in
old
age
a
lot
more
tranquil
hope
thence
springs
of
thy
escape
some
future
day
from
all
thy
threaten
woes
such
was
their
mutual
sweet
meantime
eurynome
and
euryclea
dress
their
bed
by
light
of
the
clear
torch
and
when
dispatchful
they
had
spread
it
broad
and
deep
the
ancient
nurse
to
her
own
bed
retired
then
came
eurynome
to
whom
in
trust
the
chambers
appertain
and
with
a
torch
conducted
them
to
rest
she
introduced
the
happy
pair
and
went
transported
they
to
rites
connubial
intermitted
long
and
now
recover
gave
themselves
again
meantime
the
prince
the
herdsman
and
the
good
eumæus
giving
rest
each
to
his
feet
ceased
from
the
dance
they
made
the
women
cease
also
and
to
their
chambers
all
within
the
twilight
edifice
repair
at
length
with
conjugal
endearment
both
satiate
ulysses
tasted
and
his
spouse
the
sweets
of
mutual
converse
she
rehearsed
noblest
of
women
all
her
woes
beneath
that
roof
sustain
while
she
beheld
the
profligacy
of
the
who
in
their
wooing
had
consumed
his
herds
and
fatted
flocks
and
drawn
his
vessels
dry
while
brave
ulysses
in
his
turn
to
her
related
his
successes
and
escapes
and
his
afflictions
also
he
told
her
all
she
listen
charm
nor
slumber
on
his
eyes
fell
once
or
ere
he
had
rehearsed
the
whole
beginning
he
discoursed
how
at
the
first
he
conquer
in
ciconia
and
thence
the
fruitful
shores
of
the
lotophagi
the
cyclops
deeds
he
told
her
next
and
how
he
well
avenged
on
him
his
slaughter
friends
whom
pitiless
the
monster
had
devour
how
to
the
isle
of
æolus
he
came
who
welcom
him
and
safe
dismiss
him
thence
although
not
destin
to
regain
so
soon
his
native
land
for
the
fishy
deep
loud
tempests
snatch
him
sighing
back
again
how
also
at
telepylus
he
arrived
town
of
the
læstrygonians
who
destroyed
his
ships
with
all
their
mariners
his
own
except
who
in
his
sable
bark
escaped
of
guileful
circe
too
he
spake
in
various
artifice
and
how
he
with
sails
and
oars
the
squalid
realms
of
death
desirous
to
consult
the
prophet
there
theban
tiresias
and
how
there
he
all
his
companions
and
the
mother
bland
who
bare
him
nourisher
of
his
infant
years
how
next
he
heard
the
sirens
in
one
strain
all
chiming
sweet
and
how
he
reach
the
rocks
erratic
scylla
and
charybdis
dire
which
none
secure
from
injury
may
pass
then
how
the
partners
of
his
voyage
slew
the
sun
own
beeves
and
how
the
jove
hurl
down
his
smoky
bolts
into
his
bark
depriving
him
at
once
of
all
his
crew
whose
dreadful
fate
he
yet
himself
escaped
how
to
ogygia
isle
he
came
where
dwelt
the
nymph
calypso
who
enamour
wish
to
espouse
him
and
within
her
spacious
grot
detain
and
fed
and
promis
him
a
life
exempt
for
ever
from
the
sap
of
age
but
him
moved
not
how
also
he
arrived
after
much
toil
on
the
phæacian
coast
where
heart
revered
him
as
a
god
and
whence
enriching
him
with
brass
and
gold
and
costly
raiment
first
they
sent
him
home
at
this
last
word
oblivious
slumber
sweet
fell
on
him
dissipating
all
his
cares
meantime
minerva
goddess
on
other
thoughts
intent
soon
as
she
ulysses
with
connubial
joys
sufficed
and
with
sweet
sleep
at
once
from
ocean
the
chariot
of
the
morn
to
illumine
earth
then
from
his
fleecy
couch
the
hero
sprang
and
thus
his
spouse
enjoined
oh
consort
dear
already
we
have
against
our
lot
till
wearied
with
the
toil
my
painful
absence
thou
with
ceaseless
tears
deploring
and
myself
in
deep
distress
withheld
reluctant
from
my
native
shores
by
jove
and
by
the
other
of
but
since
we
have
in
this
delightful
bed
met
once
again
watch
thou
and
keep
secure
all
my
domestic
treasures
and
ere
long
i
will
replace
my
sheep
by
those
imperious
suitors
and
the
greeks
shall
add
yet
others
till
my
folds
be
fill
but
to
the
woodlands
go
i
now

the

this
that
the

being
attached
to
the

of

still
rooted
was
immovable

apprized
of
the
impossibility

a

so
spake
the

we
unsuspicious
all
with
her
request
complied
thenceforth
all
day
she
wove
the
ample
web
and
by
the
aid
of
torches
ravell
it
again
at
night
three
years
she
thus
by
artifice
our

eluded
safe
but
when
the
fourth
arrived
and
the

season
after
many
moons
and
fleeting
days
return
a
damsel
then
of
her
attendants
conscious
of
the
fraud
reveal
it
and
we
found
her
pulling
loose
the
splendid
web
thus
through
constraint
at
length
she
finish
it
and
in
her
own
despight
but
when
the
queen
produced
at
length
her
work
finish
bright
as
the
sun

then
came
ulysses
by
some
adverse
god
conducted
to
a
cottage
on
the
verge
of
his

fields
in
which
his
dwells
there
also
the

conducted
by

attired
in
tatters
foul
a
mendicant

seem
and
halted
on
a
staff
so
clad
and
on
the
sudden
he
escaped
all
knowledge
even
of
our
eldest
there
and
we
reviled
and
smote
him
he
although
beneath
his
own
roof
smitten
and
reproach
with
patience
suffer
it
awhile
but
roused
by
inspiration
of
jove
at
length
in
concert
with
his
son
to
his
own
chamber
his
resplendent
arms
there
lodg
them
safe
and
barr
the

doors

in

we
bade
the
swain
withhold
it
from
him
plead

as
he
might
telemachus
alone
with
loud
command
bade
give
it
him
and
the
illustrious
chief
receiving
in
his
hand
the
bow
with
ease
bent
it
and

a

ardour
urged
them
and
with
such
dispatch
they
slew
us
on

sides
hideous
were
heard
the
groans
of
dying
men
fell
to
the
earth
with

and
the
floor

with

such
royal

was
the
fate
by
which
we
perish
all

lie
unburied

and
in

long
have
worn

said
and
gave
into
his

care
his
arms
they
swift
proceeded
to
the
house
and
to
the
fruitful
grove
himself
as
swift
to
prove
his

down
he
went
at

into
the
spacious
but
found
nor
dolius
there
nor
any

were
occupied
elsewhere

with

himself
employ
collecting
thorns
with
which
to
fence
the

in

umbrageous
spot
he

alone
laertes
with
his

clearing

sordid
his

with
many
a

mended
unseemly
leathern
were
his

also

defence
against
sharp
thorns
while
gloves
secured
his
hands
from

on
his
head
he
bore
a
casque
nourishing
hopeless
woe
no
sooner
then
the
hero
saw
him
and
wretched
than
he
paused
beneath
a
lofty
shade
to
weep
there
standing
much
he
mused
whether
at
once
kissing
and
clasping
in
his
arms
his
sire
to
tell
him
all
by
what
means
he
had
his
native
country
or
to
prove
him
first
at
length
he
chose
as
his
best
course
with
words
of
seeming
strangeness
to
accost
his
ear
and
with
that
purpose
moved
direct
toward
him

thy

slights
thee
thus
nor
speaks
thy

thy

thee
but
thou
resemblest
more
a

yes
thou
resemblest
one
who
bathed
and
fed
should
softly
sleep
such
is
the
claim
of

but
tell
me
true
for
whom
labourest

and

his
ancient

weeping
replied
stranger
thou
hast
in

attain
the
isle
of
thy
enquiry
but
it
is
by
a
rude
race
and
lawless
vain
alas
were
all
thy
gifts

thou
found
him
living
here
in

sent
thee
hence
requiting
honourably
in

thy
hospitality

beasts
and
fowls
of

nor

or
she
who
bare
him

to
bathe
his
shrouded
body
with
our
tears
nor
his
chaste
wife
penelope
to
close
her
husband
eyes
and
to
deplore
his
doom
which
is
the
privilege
of
the
dead
but
tell
me
also
thou
for
i
would
learn
who
art
thou
whence
where
born
and
sprung
from
whom

bark
in
which
thou
and
thy
godlike
friends
arrived
where

coast
or
thou
only
passenger
on

skirts
your
city
i
have
moor
my
bark
five
years
have
pass
since
thy
ulysses
left
unhappy
chief
my
country
yet
the
birds
at
his
departure
hovered
on
the
right
and
in
that
sign
rejoicing
i
him
thence
rejoicing
also
for
we
hoped
to
mix
in
social
intercourse
again
and
to
exchange
once
more
pledges
of
love
he
spake
then
sorrow
as

pour
it
on

with
many
a
piteous

commotion
felt
and
his
stretch
nostrils
with
agony
while

and
kiss

and
exclaim

twenty
years

sorrow

henceforth
all
lamentation
for

tell
thee
true
and
the
occasion
bids
me
briefly
tell
thee
i
have
slain
all
the
suitors
at
my
home
and
all
their
taunts
and
injuries
avenged
then
answer
thus
laertes
quick
return
if
thou
hast
come
again
and

my
son
ulysses
give
me
then
the
proof
indubitable
that
i
may
believe
to
whom
ulysses
replied
view
first
the
scar
which
with
his
tusk
a
wild
boar
gave
me
when
at
thy
command
and
at
my
mother
to
autolycus
her
father
on
parnassus
i
seeking
the
gifts
which
while
a
guest
of

beside
this
proof
i
will

between
them
and
thou

ten
apples
thirty
figs
and
fifty

he
said
laertes
conscious
of
the
proofs
indubitable
by
ulysses
with

and
heart
both
arms
around
him
threw
the
hero
drew
to
his
bosom
close
his
fainting
sire
who
breath
and
his

thus
spake
aloud
ye

oh
then
your
residence
is
still
on
the
olympian
heights
if
punishment
at
last
hath
seized
on
those
flagitious
men
but
terrour
shakes
me
lest
incensed
ere
long
all
ithaca
flock
hither
and
dispatch
swift
messengers
with
these
dread
tidings
charged
to
cephallenian
state
around
him
answer
then
ulysses
courage
fear
nought
but
let
us
to
the
house
beside
the
garden
whither
i
have
sent
telemachus
the
herdsman
and
the
good
eumæus
to
prepare
us
quick
repast
so
they
conferr
and
to
laertes
house
pass
on
together
there
arrived
they
found
those
three
preparing
now
their
plenteous
feast
and
mingling
sable
wine
then
by
the
hands
of
his
sicilian
matron
the
old
king
was
bathed
anointed
and
attired
afresh
and
pallas
drawing
nigh
dilated
more
his
limbs
and
gave
his
whole
majestic
form
encrease
of
amplitude
he
left
the
bath
his
son
amazed
as
he
had
seen
a
god
alighted
newly
from
the
skies
exclaim
my
father
doubtless
some
immortal
hath
clothed
thy
form
with
dignity
divine
then
thus
replied
his
venerable
sire
jove
pallas
phœbus
oh
that
i
such
vigour
now
as
when
in

i
took
nericus
continental
city

with
my
brave
cephallenians
oh
that
such
and
arm
as
then
i
yesterday
had
stood
beside
thee
in
thy
palace
combating
those
suitors
proud
then
had
i
strew
the
floor
with
slain
to
thy
exceeding
joy
such
was
their
conference
and
now
the
task
of
preparation
ended
and
the
feast
set
forth
on
couches
and
on
thrones
they
sat
and
ranged
in
order
due
took
each
his
share
then
ancient

and
with
him
his

arrived
by
the
sicilian

summon
their
and
their

kind
attendant
ever
in
his
eve
of
life
they
seeing
and
recalling
soon
to
mind
ulysses
in
the
middle
mansion
stood
when
thus
ulysses
with
a
voice
of
some
reproof
but
gentle
them
bespake
old
servant
sit
and
eat
banishing
fear
and
mute
amazement
for
although
provoked
by
appetite
we
have
long
time
abstain
expecting
moment
thy
return
he
said
then
dolius
with
expanded
arms
sprang
right
toward
ulysses
seized
his
hand
kiss
it
and
in
wing
accents
thus
replied
oh
master
ever
dear
since
thee
the
gods
themselves
in
answer
to
our
warm
desires
have
unexpectedly
at
length
restored
hail
and
be
happy
and
make
thee
such
but
say
and
truly
knows
the
prudent
queen
already
thy
return
or
shall
we
send
ourselves
an
herald
with
the
joyful
news
to
whom
ulysses
replied
my
ancient
friend
thou
release
thy
mind
from
that
solicitude
she
knows
it
well
so
he
then
dolius
to
his
glossy
seat
return
and
all
his
sons
around
ulysses
welcom
him
and
grasp
his
hand
then
sat
beside
their
father
thus
beneath
laertes
roof
they
joyful
took
repast
but
fame
with
rapid
haste
the
city
in
part
promulging
in
all
ears
the
suitors
horrid
fate
no
sooner
heard
the
multitude
that
tale
than
one
and
all
groaning
they
met
and
murmuring
before
ulysses
gates
bringing
the
bodies
forth
they
buried
each
his
friend
but
gave
the
dead
of
other
cities
to
be
ferried
home
by
fishermen
on
board
their
rapid
barks
all
hasted
then
to
council
sorrow
wrung
their
hearts
and
the
assembly
now
convened
arising
first
eupithes
spake
for
grief
sat
heavy
on
his
soul
grief
for
the
loss
of
his
antinoüs
by
ulysses
slain
foremost
of
all
whom
mourning
thus
he
said
my
friends
no
trivial
fruits
the
greecians
reap
of
this
man
doings
he
took
with
him
on
board
his
barks
a
train
and
bold
then
lost
his
barks
lost
all
his
train
and
our
noblest
slew
at
his
return
come
therefore
ere
he
yet
escape
by
flight
to
pylus
or
to
noble
elis
realm
of
the
epeans
follow
him
else
shame
attends
us
and
indelible
reproach
if
we
avenge
not
on
these
men
the
blood
of
our
own
sons
and
brothers
farewell
then
all
that
makes
life
desirable
my
wish
henceforth
shall
be
to
mingle
with
the
shades
oh
then
pursue
and
seize
them
ere
they
fly
thus
he
with
tears
and
pity
moved
in
all
then
medon
and
the
sacred
bard
whom
sleep
had
lately
left
arriving
from
the
house
of
laertiades
approach
amid
the
throng
they
stood
all
wonder
seeing
them
and
medon
prudent
senior
thus
began
hear
me
my
countrymen
ulysses
with
no
disapprobation
of
the
gods
the
deed
that
ye
deplore
i
saw
myself
a
immortal
at
the
hero
side
in
semblance
just
of
mentor
now
the
god
in
front
apparent
led
him
on
and
now
from
side
to
side
of
all
the
palace
urged
to
flight
the

heaps
on

they
fell

alone
among
them
all
knew

thus
began
now
o
ye
men
of
ithaca
my
words
attentive
hear
by
your
own
fault
my
friends
this
deed
hath
been
perform
for
when
myself
and
noble
mentor
counsell
you
to
check
the
sin
and
folly
of
your
sons
ye
would
not
great
was
their
wickedness
and
flagrant
wrong
they
wrought
the
wealth
devouring
and
the
wife
dishonouring
of
an
illustrious
chief
whom
they
deem
destined
never
to
return
but
hear
my
counsel
go
not
lest
ye
draw
disaster
down
and
woe
on
your

heads
he
ended
then
with
roar
although
part
kept
their
seats
upsprang
the
multitude
for
halitherses
pleased
them
not
they
chose
eupithes
counsel
rather
all
at
once
to
arms
they
flew
and
clad
in
dazzling
brass
before
the
city
form
their
dense
array
leader
infatuate
at
their
head
eupithes
hoping
to
avenge
his
son
antinoüs
but
was
himself
ordain
to
meet
his
doom
and
to
return
no
more
then
thus
minerva
to
saturnian
jove
oh
father
son
of
saturn
jove
supreme
declare
the
purpose
hidden
in
thy
breast
wilt
thou
that
this
hostility
proceed
or
wilt
thou
grant
them
amity
again
to
whom
the
god
replied
why
asks
my
daughter
didst
thou
not
design
thyself
that
brave
ulysses
coming
home
should
slay
those
profligates
act
as
thou
wilt
but
thus
i
counsel
since
the
noble
chief
hath
slain
the
suitors
now
let
peace
ensue
and
reign
ulysses
evermore
the
slaughter
of
their
brethren
and
their

to
strike
from
their
remembrance
shall
be

let
mutual
amity
as
at
the
first
unite
them
and
let
wealth
and
peace
abound
so
saying
he
animated
to
her
task
minerva
prompt
before
and
from
the
heights
olympian
down
to
ithaca
she
flew
meantime
ulysses
for
their
hunger
now
and
thirst
were
sated
thus
address
his
hinds
look
ye
abroad
lest
haply
they
approach
he
said
and
at
his
word
forth
went
a
son
of
dolius
at
the
gate
he
stood
and
thence
beholding
all
that
multitude
at
hand
in
accents
wing
thus
to
ulysses
spake
they
come
they
are
already
arrived
arm
all
then
all
arising
put
their
armour
on
ulysses
with
his
three
and
the
six
sons
of
dolius
dolius
also
with
the
rest
arm
and
laertes
although
warriors
perforce
when
all
were
clad
alike
in
radiant
armour
throwing
wide
the
gates
they
sallied
and
ulysses
led
the
way
then
jove
own
daughter
pallas
in
the
form
and
with
the
voice
of
mentor
came
in
view
whom
seeing
laertiades
rejoiced
and
thus
telemachus
his
son
bespake
now
oh
my
son
thou
shalt
observe
untold
by
me
where
fight
the
bravest
oh
shame
not
thine
ancestry
who
have
in
all
the
earth
proof
given
of
valour
in
all
ages
past
to
whom
telemachus
discrete
replied
my
father
if
thou
wish
that
spectacle
thou
shalt
behold
thy
son
as
thou
hast
said
in
nought
dishonouring
his
noble
race
then
was
laertes
joyful
and
exclaim
what
sun
hath
oh
blessed
gods
my
son
and
grandson
emulous
dispute
the
prize
of
glory
and
my
soul
exults
he
ended
and
minerva
drawing
nigh
to
the
old
king
thus
counsell
him
oh
friend
whom
most
i
love
son
of
arcesias
preferring
to
the
virgin
and
to
her
father
jove
delay
not
shake
thy
lance
in
air
and
give
it
instant
flight
so
saying
the
goddess
nerved
his
arm
anew
he
sought
in
the
daughter
dread
of
jove
and
brandishing
it
hurl
his
lance
it
struck
eupithes
pierced
his
helmet
that
stay
it
not
but
forth
it
sprang
beyond
and
with
loud
clangor
of
his
arms
he
fell
then
flew
ulysses
and
his
noble
son
with
faulchion
and
with
spear
of
double
edge
to
the
assault
and
of
them
all
had
left
none
living
none
had
to
his
home
return
but
that
jove
virgin
daughter
with
a
voice
of
loud
authority
thus
quell
them
all
peace
o
ye
men
of
ithaca
while
yet
the
field
remains
undeluged
with
your
blood
so
she
and
fear
at
once
paled
cheek
all
trembled
at
the
voice
divine
their
arms
escaping
from
the
grasp
fell
to
the
earth
and
covetous
of
longer
life
each
fled
back
to
the
city
then
ulysses
sent
his
voice
abroad
and
with
an
eagle
force
sprang
on
the
people
but
saturnian
jove
cast
down
incontinent
his
smouldring
bolt
at
pallas
feet
and
thus
the
goddess
spake
laertes

son
for

forbear

from

lest
thyself
incur
the

of
