the
great
mogul
i
the
woman
with
the
diamond
i
was
perhaps
the
plainest
girl
in
the
room
that
night
i
was
also
the
happiest
up
to
one
o
clock
then
my
whole
world
crumbled
or
at
least
suffered
an
eclipse
why
and
how
i
am
about
to
relate
i
was
not
made
for
love
this
i
had
often
said
to
myself
very
often
of
late
in
figure
i
am
too
diminutive
in
face
far
too
unbeautiful
for
me
to
cherish
expectations
of
this
nature
indeed
love
had
never
entered
into
my
plan
of
life
as
was
evinced
by
the
nurse
s
diploma
i
had
just
gained
after
three
years
of
hard
study
and
severe
training
i
was
not
made
for
love
but
if
i
had
been
had
i
been
gifted
with
height
regularity
of
feature
or
even
with
that
eloquence
of
expression
which
redeems
all
defects
save
those
which
savor
of
deformity
i
knew
well
whose
eye
i
should
have
chosen
to
please
whose
heart
i
should
have
felt
proud
to
win
this
knowledge
came
with
a
rush
to
my
heart
did
i
say
heart
i
should
have
said
understanding
which
is
something
very
different
when
at
the
end
of
the
first
dance
i
looked
up
from
the
midst
of
the
bevy
of
girls
by
whom
i
was
surrounded
and
saw
anson
durand
s
fine
figure
emerging
from
that
quarter
of
the
hall
where
our
host
and
hostess
stood
to
receive
their
guests
his
eye
was
roaming
hither
and
thither
and
his
manner
was
both
eager
and
expectant
whom
was
he
seeking
some
one
of
the
many
bright
and
vivacious
girls
about
me
for
he
turned
almost
instantly
our
way
but
which
one
i
thought
i
knew
i
remembered
at
whose
house
i
had
met
him
first
at
whose
house
i
had
seen
him
many
times
since
she
was
a
lovely
girl
witty
and
vivacious
and
she
stood
at
this
very
moment
at
my
elbow
in
her
beauty
lay
the
lure
the
natural
lure
for
a
man
of
his
gifts
and
striking
personality
if
i
continued
to
watch
i
should
soon
see
his
countenance
light
up
under
the
recognition
she
could
not
fail
to
give
him
and
i
was
right
in
another
instant
it
did
and
with
a
brightness
there
was
no
mistaking
but
one
feeling
common
to
the
human
heart
lends
such
warmth
such
expressiveness
to
the
features
how
handsome
it
made
him
look
how
distinguished
how
everything
i
was
not
except
but
what
does
this
mean
he
has
passed
miss
sperry
passed
her
with
a
smile
and
a
friendly
word
and
is
speaking
to
me
singling
me
out
offering
me
his
arm
he
is
smiling
too
not
as
he
smiled
on
miss
sperry
but
more
warmly
with
more
that
is
personal
in
it
i
took
his
arm
in
a
daze
the
lights
were
dimmer
than
i
thought
nothing
was
really
bright
except
his
smile
it
seemed
to
change
the
world
for
me
i
forgot
that
i
was
plain
forgot
that
i
was
small
with
nothing
to
recommend
me
to
the
eye
or
heart
and
let
myself
be
drawn
away
asking
nothing
anticipating
nothing
till
i
found
myself
alone
with
him
in
the
fragrant
recesses
of
the
conservatory
with
only
the
throb
of
music
in
our
ears
to
link
us
to
the
scene
we
had
left
why
had
he
brought
me
here
into
this
fairyland
of
opalescent
lights
and
intoxicating
perfumes
what
could
he
have
to
say
to
show
ah
in
another
moment
i
knew
he
had
seized
my
hands
and
love
ardent
love
came
pouring
from
his
lips
could
it
be
real
was
i
the
object
of
all
this
feeling
i
if
so
then
life
had
changed
for
me
indeed
silent
from
rush
of
emotion
i
searched
his
face
to
see
if
this
paradise
whose
gates
i
was
thus
passionately
bidden
to
enter
was
indeed
a
verity
or
only
a
dream
born
of
the
excitement
of
the
dance
and
the
charm
of
a
scene
exceptional
in
its
splendor
and
picturesqueness
even
for
so
luxurious
a
city
as
new
york
but
it
was
no
mere
dream
truth
and
earnestness
were
in
his
manner
and
his
words
were
neither
feverish
nor
forced
i
love
you
i
i
need
you
so
i
heard
and
so
he
soon
made
me
believe
you
have
charmed
me
from
the
first
your
tantalizing
trusting
loyal
self
like
no
other
sweeter
than
any
other
has
drawn
the
heart
from
my
breast
i
have
seen
many
women
admired
many
women
but
you
only
have
i
loved
will
you
be
my
wife
i
was
dazzled
moved
beyond
anything
i
could
have
conceived
i
forgot
all
that
i
had
hitherto
said
to
myself
all
that
i
had
endeavored
to
impress
upon
my
heart
when
i
beheld
him
approaching
intent
as
i
believed
in
his
search
for
another
woman
and
confiding
in
his
honesty
trusting
entirely
to
his
faith
i
allowed
the
plans
and
purposes
of
years
to
vanish
in
the
glamour
of
this
new
joy
and
spoke
the
word
which
linked
us
together
in
a
bond
which
half
an
hour
before
i
had
never
dreamed
would
unite
me
to
any
man
his
impassioned
mine
mine
filled
my
cup
to
overflowing
something
of
the
ecstasy
of
living
entered
my
soul
which
in
spite
of
all
i
have
suffered
since
recreated
the
world
for
me
and
made
all
that
went
before
but
the
prelude
to
the
new
life
the
new
joy
oh
i
was
happy
happy
perhaps
too
happy
as
the
conservatory
filled
and
we
passed
back
into
the
adjoining
room
the
glimpse
i
caught
of
myself
in
one
of
the
mirrors
startled
me
into
thinking
so
for
had
it
not
been
for
the
odd
color
of
my
dress
and
the
unique
way
in
which
i
wore
my
hair
that
night
i
should
not
have
recognized
the
beaming
girl
who
faced
me
so
naively
from
the
depths
of
the
responsive
glass
can
one
be
too
happy
i
do
not
know
i
know
that
one
can
be
too
perplexed
too
burdened
and
too
sad
thus
far
i
have
spoken
only
of
myself
in
connection
with
the
evening
s
elaborate
function
but
though
entitled
by
my
old
dutch
blood
to
a
certain
social
consideration
which
i
am
happy
to
say
never
failed
me
i
even
in
this
hour
of
supreme
satisfaction
attracted
very
little
attention
and
awoke
small
comment
there
was
another
woman
present
better
calculated
to
do
this
a
fair
woman
large
and
of
a
bountiful
presence
accustomed
to
conquest
and
gifted
with
the
power
of
carrying
off
her
victories
with
a
certain
lazy
grace
irresistibly
fascinating
to
the
ordinary
man
a
gorgeously
appareled
woman
with
a
diamond
on
her
breast
too
vivid
for
most
women
almost
too
vivid
for
her
i
noticed
this
diamond
early
in
the
evening
and
then
i
noticed
her
she
was
not
as
fine
as
the
diamond
but
she
was
very
fine
and
had
i
been
in
a
less
ecstatic
frame
of
mind
i
might
have
envied
the
homage
she
received
from
all
the
men
not
excepting
him
upon
whose
arm
i
leaned
later
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
i
envied
less
the
ball
was
a
private
and
very
elegant
one
there
were
some
notable
guests
one
gentleman
in
particular
was
pointed
out
to
me
as
an
englishman
of
great
distinction
and
political
importance
i
thought
him
a
very
interesting
man
for
his
years
but
odd
and
a
trifle
though
greatly
courted
he
seemed
strangely
restless
under
the
fire
of
eyes
to
which
he
was
constantly
subjected
and
only
happy
when
free
to
use
his
own
in
contemplation
of
the
scene
about
him
had
i
been
less
absorbed
in
my
own
happiness
i
might
have
noted
sooner
than
i
did
that
this
contemplation
was
confined
to
such
groups
as
gathered
about
the
lady
with
the
diamond
but
this
i
failed
to
observe
at
the
time
and
consequently
was
much
surprised
to
come
upon
him
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
dances
talking
with
this
lady
in
an
animated
and
courtly
manner
totally
opposed
to
the
apathy
amounting
to
boredom
with
which
he
had
hitherto
met
all
advances
yet
it
was
not
admiration
for
her
person
which
he
openly
displayed
during
the
whole
time
he
stood
there
his
eyes
seldom
rose
to
her
face
they
lingered
this
was
what
aroused
my
curiosity
on
the
great
fan
of
ostrich
plumes
which
this
opulent
beauty
held
against
her
breast
was
he
desirous
of
seeing
the
great
diamond
she
thus
unconsciously
or
was
it
consciously
shielded
from
his
gaze
it
was
possible
for
as
i
continued
to
note
him
he
suddenly
bent
toward
her
and
as
quickly
raised
himself
again
with
a
look
which
was
quite
inexplicable
to
me
the
lady
had
shifted
her
fan
a
moment
and
his
eyes
had
fallen
on
the
gem
the
next
thing
i
recall
with
any
definiteness
was
a
conversation
which
i
held
with
my
lover
on
a
certain
yellow
divan
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
halls
to
the
right
of
this
divan
rose
a
curtained
recess
highly
suggestive
of
romance
called
the
as
this
alcove
figures
prominently
in
my
story
i
will
pause
here
to
describe
it
it
was
originally
intended
to
contain
a
large
group
of
statuary
which
our
host
ramsdell
had
ordered
from
italy
to
adorn
his
new
house
he
is
a
man
of
original
ideas
in
regard
to
such
matters
and
in
this
instance
had
gone
so
far
as
to
have
this
end
of
the
house
constructed
with
a
special
view
to
an
advantageous
display
of
this
promised
work
of
art
fearing
the
ponderous
effect
of
a
pedestal
large
enough
to
hold
such
a
considerable
group
he
had
planned
to
raise
it
to
the
level
of
the
eye
by
having
the
alcove
floor
built
a
few
feet
higher
than
the
main
one
a
flight
of
low
wide
steps
connected
the
two
which
following
the
curve
of
the
wall
added
much
to
the
beauty
of
this
portion
of
the
hall
the
group
was
a
failure
and
was
never
shipped
but
the
alcove
remained
and
possessing
as
it
did
all
the
advantages
of
a
room
in
the
way
of
heat
and
light
had
been
turned
into
a
miniature
retreat
of
exceptional
beauty
the
seclusion
it
offered
extended
or
so
we
were
happy
to
think
to
the
solitary
divan
at
its
base
on
which
durand
and
i
were
seated
with
possibly
an
undue
confidence
in
the
advantage
of
our
position
we
were
discussing
a
subject
interesting
only
to
ourselves
when
durand
interrupted
himself
to
declare
you
are
the
woman
i
want
you
and
you
only
and
i
want
you
soon
when
do
you
think
you
can
marry
me
within
a
week
if
did
my
look
stop
him
i
was
startled
i
had
heard
no
incoherent
phrase
from
him
before
a
week
i
remonstrated
we
take
more
time
than
that
to
fit
ourselves
for
a
journey
or
some
transient
pleasure
i
hardly
realize
my
engagement
you
have
not
been
thinking
of
it
for
these
last
two
months
as
i
no
i
replied
demurely
forgetting
everything
else
in
my
delight
at
this
admission
nor
are
you
a
nomad
among
clubs
and
no
i
have
a
nor
do
you
love
me
as
deeply
as
i
do
this
i
thought
open
to
argument
the
home
you
speak
of
is
a
luxurious
one
he
continued
i
can
not
offer
you
its
equal
do
you
expect
me
to
i
was
indignant
you
know
that
i
do
not
shall
i
who
deliberately
chose
a
nurse
s
life
when
an
indulgent
uncle
s
heart
and
home
were
open
to
me
shrink
from
braving
poverty
with
the
man
i
love
we
will
begin
as
simply
as
you
please
no
he
peremptorily
put
in
yet
with
a
certain
hesitancy
which
seemed
to
speak
of
doubts
he
hardly
acknowledged
to
himself
i
will
not
marry
you
if
i
must
expose
you
to
privation
or
to
the
genteel
poverty
i
hate
i
love
you
more
than
you
realize
and
wish
to
make
your
life
a
happy
one
i
can
not
give
you
all
you
have
been
accustomed
to
in
your
rich
uncle
s
house
but
if
matters
prosper
with
me
if
the
chance
i
have
built
on
succeeds
and
it
will
fail
or
succeed
tonight
you
will
have
those
comforts
which
love
will
heighten
into
luxuries
and
and
he
was
becoming
incoherent
again
and
this
time
with
his
eyes
fixed
elsewhere
than
on
my
face
following
his
gaze
i
discovered
what
had
distracted
his
attention
the
lady
with
the
diamond
was
approaching
us
on
her
way
to
the
alcove
she
was
accompanied
by
two
gentlemen
both
strangers
to
me
and
her
head
sparkling
with
brilliants
was
turning
from
one
to
the
other
with
an
indolent
grace
i
was
not
surprised
that
the
man
at
my
side
quivered
and
made
a
start
as
if
to
rise
she
was
a
gorgeous
image
in
comparison
with
her
imposing
figure
in
its
trailing
robe
of
rich
pink
velvet
my
diminutive
frame
in
its
gown
must
have
looked
as
faded
and
colorless
as
a
pastel
a
striking
woman
i
remarked
as
i
saw
he
was
not
likely
to
resume
the
conversation
which
her
presence
had
interrupted
and
what
a
diamond
the
glance
he
cast
me
was
peculiar
did
you
notice
it
particularly
he
asked
astonished
for
there
was
something
very
uneasy
in
his
manner
so
that
i
half
expected
to
see
him
rise
and
join
the
group
he
was
so
eagerly
watching
without
waiting
for
my
lips
to
frame
a
response
i
quickly
replied
it
would
be
difficult
not
to
notice
what
one
would
naturally
expect
to
see
only
on
the
breast
of
a
queen
but
perhaps
she
is
a
queen
i
should
judge
so
from
the
homage
which
follows
his
eyes
sought
mine
there
was
inquiry
in
them
but
it
was
an
inquiry
i
did
not
understand
what
can
you
know
about
diamonds
he
presently
demanded
nothing
but
their
glitter
and
glitter
is
not
all
the
gem
she
wears
may
be
a
very
tawdry
i
flushed
with
humiliation
he
was
a
dealer
in
gems
that
was
his
business
and
the
check
which
he
had
put
upon
my
enthusiasm
certainly
made
me
conscious
of
my
own
presumption
yet
i
was
not
disposed
to
take
back
my
words
i
had
had
a
better
opportunity
than
himself
for
seeing
this
remarkable
jewel
and
with
the
perversity
of
a
somewhat
ruffled
mood
i
burst
forth
as
soon
as
the
color
had
subsided
from
my
cheeks
no
no
it
is
glorious
magnificent
i
never
saw
its
like
i
doubt
if
you
ever
have
for
all
your
daily
acquaintance
with
jewels
its
value
must
be
enormous
who
is
she
you
seem
to
know
it
was
a
direct
question
but
i
received
no
reply
durand
s
eyes
had
followed
the
lady
who
had
lingered
somewhat
ostentatiously
on
the
top
step
and
they
did
not
return
to
me
till
she
had
vanished
with
her
companions
behind
the
long
plush
curtain
which
partly
veiled
the
entrance
by
this
time
he
had
forgotten
my
words
if
he
had
ever
heard
them
and
it
was
with
the
forced
animation
of
one
whose
thoughts
are
elsewhere
that
he
finally
returned
to
the
old
plea
when
would
i
marry
him
if
he
could
offer
me
a
home
in
a
month
and
he
would
know
by
if
he
could
do
so
would
i
come
to
him
then
he
would
not
say
in
a
week
that
was
perhaps
to
soon
but
in
a
month
would
i
not
promise
to
be
his
in
a
month
what
i
answered
i
scarcely
recall
his
eyes
had
stolen
back
to
the
alcove
and
mine
had
followed
them
the
gentlemen
who
had
accompanied
the
lady
inside
were
coming
out
again
but
others
were
advancing
to
take
their
places
and
soon
she
was
engaged
in
holding
a
regular
court
in
this
favored
retreat
why
should
this
interest
me
why
should
i
notice
her
or
look
that
way
at
all
because
durand
did
possibly
i
remember
that
for
all
his
ardent
i
felt
a
little
piqued
that
he
should
divide
his
attentions
in
this
way
perhaps
i
thought
that
for
this
evening
at
least
he
might
have
been
blind
to
a
mere
coquette
s
fascinations
i
was
thus
doubly
engaged
in
listening
to
my
lover
s
words
and
in
watching
the
various
gentlemen
who
went
up
and
down
the
steps
when
a
former
partner
advanced
and
reminded
me
that
i
had
promised
him
a
waltz
loath
to
leave
durand
yet
seeing
no
way
of
excusing
myself
to
fox
i
cast
an
appealing
glance
at
the
former
and
was
greatly
chagrined
to
find
him
already
on
his
feet
enjoy
your
dance
he
cried
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
fairbrother
and
was
gone
before
my
new
partner
had
taken
me
on
his
arm
was
fairbrother
the
lady
with
the
diamond
yes
as
i
turned
to
enter
the
parlor
with
my
partner
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
durand
s
tall
figure
just
disappearing
from
the
step
behind
the
curtains
who
is
fairbrother
i
inquired
of
fox
at
the
end
of
the
dance
fox
who
is
one
of
society
s
perennial
beaux
knows
everybody
she
is
well
she
was
abner
fairbrother
s
wife
you
know
fairbrother
the
millionaire
who
built
that
curious
structure
on
street
at
present
they
are
living
apart
an
amicable
understanding
i
believe
her
diamond
makes
her
conspicuous
it
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
stones
in
new
york
perhaps
in
the
united
states
have
you
observed
it
yes
that
is
at
a
distance
do
you
think
her
very
handsome
mrs
fairbrother
she
s
called
so
but
she
s
not
my
here
he
gave
me
a
killing
glance
i
admire
women
of
mind
and
heart
they
do
not
need
to
wear
jewels
worth
an
ordinary
man
s
i
looked
about
for
an
excuse
to
leave
this
none
too
desirable
partner
let
us
go
back
into
the
long
hall
i
urged
the
ceaseless
whirl
of
these
dancers
is
making
me
with
the
ease
of
a
gallant
man
he
took
me
on
his
arm
and
soon
we
were
promenading
again
in
the
direction
of
the
alcove
a
passing
glimpse
of
its
interior
was
afforded
me
as
we
turned
to
retrace
our
steps
in
front
of
the
yellow
divan
the
lady
with
the
diamond
was
still
there
a
fold
of
the
superb
pink
velvet
she
wore
protruded
across
the
gap
made
by
the
curtains
just
as
it
had
done
a
before
but
it
was
impossible
to
see
her
face
or
who
was
with
her
what
i
could
see
however
and
did
was
the
figure
of
a
man
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
at
first
i
thought
this
person
unknown
to
me
then
i
perceived
that
he
was
no
other
than
the
chief
guest
of
the
evening
the
englishman
of
whom
i
have
previously
spoken
his
expression
had
altered
he
looked
now
both
anxious
and
absorbed
particularly
anxious
and
particularly
absorbed
so
much
so
that
i
was
not
surprised
that
no
one
ventured
to
approach
him
again
i
wondered
and
again
i
asked
myself
for
whom
or
for
what
he
was
waiting
for
durand
to
leave
this
lady
s
presence
no
no
i
would
not
believe
that
durand
could
not
be
there
still
yet
some
women
make
it
difficult
for
a
man
to
leave
them
and
realizing
this
i
could
not
forbear
casting
a
parting
glance
behind
me
as
yielding
to
fox
s
importunities
i
turned
toward
the
it
showed
me
the
englishman
in
the
act
of
lifting
two
cups
of
coffee
from
a
small
table
standing
near
the
door
as
his
manner
plainly
betokened
whither
he
was
bound
with
this
refreshment
i
felt
all
my
uneasiness
vanish
and
was
able
to
take
my
seat
at
one
of
the
small
tables
with
which
the
was
filled
and
for
a
few
minutes
at
least
lend
an
ear
to
fox
s
vapid
compliments
and
trite
opinions
then
my
attention
wandered
i
had
not
moved
nor
had
i
shifted
my
gaze
from
the
scene
before
me
the
ordinary
scene
of
a
gay
and
yet
i
found
myself
looking
as
if
through
a
mist
i
had
not
even
seen
develop
at
something
as
strange
unusual
and
remote
as
any
phantasm
yet
distinct
enough
in
its
outlines
for
me
to
get
a
decided
impression
of
a
square
of
light
surrounding
the
figure
of
a
man
in
a
peculiar
pose
not
easily
imagined
and
not
easily
described
it
all
passed
in
an
instant
and
i
sat
staring
at
the
window
opposite
me
with
the
feeling
of
one
who
has
just
seen
a
vision
yet
almost
immediately
i
forgot
the
whole
occurrence
in
my
anxiety
as
to
durand
s
whereabouts
certainly
he
was
amusing
himself
very
much
elsewhere
or
he
would
have
found
an
opportunity
of
joining
me
long
before
this
he
was
not
even
in
sight
and
i
grew
weary
of
the
endless
menu
and
the
senseless
chit
chat
of
my
companion
and
finding
him
amenable
to
my
whims
rose
from
my
seat
at
table
and
made
my
way
to
a
group
of
acquaintances
standing
just
outside
the
door
as
i
listened
to
their
greetings
some
impulse
led
me
to
cast
another
glance
down
the
hall
toward
the
alcove
a
man
a
waiter
was
issuing
from
it
in
a
rush
bad
news
was
in
his
face
and
as
his
eyes
encountered
those
of
ramsdell
who
was
advancing
hurriedly
to
meet
him
he
plunged
down
the
steps
with
a
cry
which
drew
a
crowd
about
the
two
in
an
instant
what
was
it
what
had
happened
mad
with
an
anxiety
i
did
not
stop
to
define
i
rushed
toward
this
group
now
swaying
from
side
to
side
in
irrepressible
excitement
when
suddenly
everything
swam
before
me
and
i
fell
in
a
swoon
to
the
floor
some
one
had
shouted
aloud
mrs
fairbrother
has
been
murdered
and
her
diamond
stolen
lock
the
doors
ii
the
gloves
i
must
have
remained
insensible
for
many
minutes
for
when
i
returned
to
full
consciousness
the
was
empty
and
the
two
hundred
guests
i
had
left
seated
at
table
were
gathered
in
agitated
groups
about
the
hall
this
was
what
i
first
noted
not
till
afterward
did
i
realize
my
own
situation
i
was
lying
on
a
couch
in
a
remote
corner
of
this
same
hall
and
beside
me
but
not
looking
at
me
stood
my
lover
durand
how
he
came
to
know
my
state
and
find
me
in
the
general
disturbance
i
did
not
stop
to
inquire
it
was
enough
for
me
at
that
moment
to
look
up
and
see
him
so
near
indeed
the
relief
was
so
great
the
sense
of
his
protection
so
comforting
that
i
involuntarily
stretched
out
my
hand
in
gratitude
toward
him
but
failing
to
attract
his
attention
slipped
to
the
floor
and
took
my
stand
at
his
side
this
roused
him
and
he
gave
me
a
look
which
steadied
me
in
spite
of
the
thrill
of
surprise
with
which
i
recognized
his
extreme
pallor
and
a
certain
peculiar
hesitation
in
his
manner
not
at
all
natural
to
it
meanwhile
some
words
uttered
near
us
were
slowly
making
their
way
into
my
benumbed
brain
the
waiter
who
had
raised
the
first
alarm
was
endeavoring
to
describe
to
an
importunate
group
in
advance
of
us
what
he
had
come
upon
in
that
murderous
alcove
i
was
carrying
about
a
tray
of
ices
he
was
saying
and
seeing
the
lady
sitting
there
went
up
i
had
expected
to
find
the
place
full
of
gentlemen
but
she
was
all
alone
and
did
not
move
as
i
picked
my
way
over
her
long
train
the
next
moment
i
had
dropped
ices
tray
and
all
i
bad
come
face
to
face
with
her
and
seen
that
she
was
dead
she
had
been
stabbed
and
robbed
there
was
no
diamond
on
her
breast
but
there
was
a
hubbub
of
disordered
sentences
seasoned
with
horrified
cries
followed
this
simple
description
then
a
general
movement
took
place
in
the
direction
of
the
alcove
during
which
durand
stooped
to
my
ear
and
whispered
we
must
get
out
of
this
you
are
not
strong
enough
to
stand
such
excitement
don
t
you
think
we
can
escape
by
the
window
over
there
what
without
wraps
and
in
such
a
snowstorm
i
protested
besides
uncle
will
be
looking
for
me
he
came
with
me
you
an
expression
of
annoyance
or
was
it
perplexity
crossed
durand
s
face
and
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
leave
me
i
must
go
he
began
but
stopped
at
my
glance
of
surprise
and
assumed
a
different
air
one
which
became
him
very
much
better
pardon
me
dear
i
will
take
you
to
your
uncle
this
this
dreadful
tragedy
interrupting
so
gay
a
scene
has
quite
upset
me
i
was
always
sensitive
to
the
sight
the
smell
even
to
the
very
mention
of
the
word
so
was
i
but
not
to
the
point
of
cowardice
but
then
i
had
not
just
come
from
an
interview
with
the
murdered
woman
her
glances
her
smiles
the
lift
of
her
eyebrows
were
not
fresh
memories
to
me
some
consideration
was
certainly
due
him
for
the
shock
he
must
be
laboring
under
yet
i
did
not
know
how
to
keep
back
the
vital
question
who
did
it
you
must
have
heard
some
one
i
have
heard
nothing
was
his
somewhat
fierce
rejoinder
then
as
i
made
a
move
what
you
do
not
wish
to
follow
the
crowd
there
i
wish
to
find
my
uncle
and
he
is
in
that
durand
said
nothing
further
and
together
we
passed
down
the
hall
a
strange
mood
pervaded
my
mind
instead
of
wishing
to
fly
a
scene
which
under
ordinary
conditions
would
have
filled
me
with
utter
repugnance
i
felt
a
desire
to
see
and
hear
everything
not
from
curiosity
such
as
moved
most
of
the
people
about
me
but
because
of
some
strong
instinctive
feeling
i
could
not
understand
as
if
it
were
my
heart
which
had
been
struck
and
my
fate
which
was
trembling
in
the
balance
we
were
consequently
among
the
first
to
hear
such
further
details
as
were
allowed
to
circulate
among
the
now
frenzied
guests
no
one
knew
the
perpetrator
of
the
deed
nor
did
there
appear
to
be
any
direct
evidence
calculated
to
fix
his
identity
indeed
the
sudden
death
of
this
beautiful
woman
in
the
midst
of
festivity
might
have
been
looked
upon
as
suicide
if
the
jewel
had
not
been
missing
from
her
breast
and
the
instrument
of
death
removed
from
the
wound
so
far
the
casual
search
which
had
been
instituted
had
failed
to
produce
this
weapon
but
the
police
would
be
here
soon
and
then
something
would
be
done
as
to
the
means
of
entrance
employed
by
the
assassin
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
opinion
the
alcove
contained
a
window
opening
upon
a
small
balcony
by
this
he
had
doubtless
entered
and
escaped
the
long
plush
curtains
which
during
the
early
part
of
the
evening
had
remained
looped
back
on
either
side
of
the
casement
were
found
at
the
moment
of
the
crime
s
discovery
closely
drawn
together
certainly
a
suspicious
circumstance
however
the
question
was
one
easily
settled
if
any
one
had
approached
by
the
balcony
there
would
be
marks
in
the
snow
to
show
it
ramsdell
had
gone
out
to
see
he
would
be
coming
back
soon
do
you
think
this
a
probable
explanation
of
the
crime
i
demanded
of
durand
at
this
juncture
if
i
remember
rightly
this
window
overlooks
the
carriage
drive
it
must
therefore
be
within
plain
sight
of
the
door
through
which
some
three
hundred
guests
have
passed
how
could
any
one
climb
to
such
a
height
lift
the
window
and
step
in
without
being
seen
you
forget
the
he
spoke
quickly
and
with
unexpected
vivacity
the
awning
runs
up
very
near
this
window
and
quite
shuts
it
off
from
the
sight
of
arriving
guests
the
drivers
of
departing
carriages
could
see
it
if
they
chanced
to
glance
back
but
their
eyes
are
usually
on
their
horses
in
such
a
crowd
the
probabilities
are
against
any
of
them
having
looked
his
brow
had
cleared
a
weight
seemed
removed
from
his
mind
when
i
went
into
the
alcove
to
see
fairbrother
she
was
sitting
in
a
chair
near
this
window
looking
out
i
remember
the
effect
of
her
splendor
against
the
snow
sifting
down
in
a
steady
stream
behind
her
the
pink
velvet
the
soft
green
of
the
curtains
on
either
side
her
brilliants
and
the
snow
for
a
background
yes
the
murderer
came
in
that
way
her
figure
would
be
plain
to
any
one
outside
and
if
she
moved
and
the
diamond
shone
don
t
you
see
what
a
probable
theory
it
is
there
must
be
ways
by
which
a
desperate
man
might
reach
that
balcony
i
believe
how
eager
he
was
and
with
what
a
look
he
turned
when
the
word
came
filtering
through
the
crowd
that
though
footsteps
had
been
found
in
the
snow
pointing
directly
toward
the
balcony
there
was
none
on
the
balcony
itself
proving
as
any
one
could
see
that
the
attack
had
not
come
from
without
since
no
one
could
enter
the
alcove
by
the
window
without
stepping
on
the
balcony
mr
durand
has
suspicions
of
his
own
i
explained
determinedly
to
myself
he
met
some
one
going
in
as
he
stepped
out
shall
i
ask
him
to
name
this
person
no
i
did
not
have
the
courage
not
while
his
face
wore
so
stern
a
look
and
was
so
resolutely
turned
away
the
next
excitement
was
a
request
from
ramsdell
for
us
all
to
go
into
the
this
led
to
various
cries
from
hysterical
lips
such
as
we
are
going
to
be
searched
he
believes
the
thief
and
murderer
to
be
still
in
the
house
do
you
see
the
diamond
on
me
why
don
t
they
confine
their
suspicions
to
the
favored
few
who
were
admitted
to
the
alcove
they
will
remarked
some
one
close
to
my
ear
but
quickly
as
i
turned
i
could
not
guess
from
whom
the
comment
came
possibly
from
a
much
beflowered
bejeweled
elderly
dame
whose
eyes
were
fixed
on
durand
s
averted
face
if
so
she
received
a
defiant
look
from
mine
which
i
do
not
believe
she
forgot
in
a
hurry
alas
it
was
not
the
only
curious
i
might
say
searching
glance
i
surprised
directed
against
him
as
we
made
our
way
to
where
i
could
see
my
uncle
struggling
to
reach
us
from
a
short
side
hall
the
whisper
seemed
to
have
gone
about
that
durand
had
been
the
last
one
to
converse
with
fairbrother
prior
to
the
tragedy
in
time
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
joining
my
uncle
he
betrayed
great
relief
at
the
sight
of
me
and
encouraged
by
his
kindly
smile
i
introduced
durand
my
conscious
air
must
have
produced
its
impression
for
he
turned
a
startled
and
inquiring
look
upon
my
companion
then
took
me
resolutely
on
his
own
arm
saying
there
is
likely
to
be
some
unpleasantness
ahead
for
all
of
us
i
do
not
think
the
police
will
allow
any
one
to
go
till
that
diamond
has
been
looked
for
this
is
a
very
serious
matter
dear
so
many
think
the
murderer
was
one
of
the
i
think
so
too
said
i
but
why
i
thought
so
or
why
i
should
say
so
with
such
vehemence
i
do
not
know
even
now
my
uncle
looked
surprised
you
had
better
not
advance
any
opinions
he
advised
a
lady
like
yourself
should
have
none
on
a
subject
so
gruesome
i
shall
never
cease
regretting
bringing
you
here
tonight
i
shall
seize
on
the
first
opportunity
to
take
you
home
at
present
we
are
supposed
to
await
the
action
of
our
he
can
not
keep
all
these
people
here
long
i
ventured
no
most
of
us
will
be
relieved
soon
had
you
not
better
get
your
wraps
so
as
to
be
ready
to
go
as
soon
as
he
gives
the
word
i
should
prefer
to
have
a
peep
at
the
people
in
the
first
was
my
perverse
reply
i
don
t
know
why
i
want
to
see
them
but
i
do
and
uncle
i
might
as
well
tell
you
now
that
i
engaged
myself
to
durand
this
evening
the
gentleman
with
me
when
you
first
came
you
have
engaged
yourself
to
to
this
man
to
marry
him
do
you
mean
i
nodded
with
a
sly
look
behind
to
see
if
durand
were
near
enough
to
hear
he
was
not
and
i
allowed
my
enthusiasm
to
escape
in
a
few
quick
words
he
has
chosen
me
i
said
the
plainest
most
uninteresting
puss
in
the
whole
my
uncle
smiled
and
i
believe
he
loves
me
at
all
events
i
know
that
i
love
my
uncle
sighed
while
giving
me
the
most
affectionate
of
glances
it
s
a
pity
you
should
have
come
to
this
understanding
said
he
he
s
an
acquaintance
of
the
murdered
woman
and
it
is
only
right
for
you
to
know
that
you
will
have
to
leave
him
behind
when
you
start
for
home
all
who
have
been
seen
entering
that
alcove
this
evening
will
necessarily
be
detained
here
till
the
coroner
my
uncle
and
i
strolled
toward
the
and
as
we
did
so
we
passed
the
library
it
held
but
one
occupant
the
englishman
he
was
seated
before
a
table
and
his
appearance
was
such
as
precluded
any
attempt
at
intrusion
even
if
one
had
been
so
disposed
there
was
a
fixity
in
his
gaze
and
a
frown
on
his
powerful
forehead
which
bespoke
a
mind
greatly
agitated
it
was
not
for
me
to
read
that
mind
much
as
it
interested
me
and
i
passed
on
chatting
as
if
i
had
not
the
least
desire
to
stop
i
can
not
say
how
much
time
elapsed
before
my
uncle
touched
me
on
the
arm
with
the
remark
the
police
are
here
in
full
force
i
saw
a
detective
in
plain
clothes
look
in
here
a
minute
ago
he
seemed
to
have
his
eye
on
you
there
he
is
again
what
can
he
want
no
don
t
turn
he
s
gone
away
frightened
as
i
had
never
been
in
all
my
life
i
managed
to
keep
my
head
up
and
maintain
an
indifferent
aspect
what
as
my
uncle
said
could
a
detective
want
of
me
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
crime
not
in
the
remotest
way
could
i
be
said
to
be
connected
with
it
why
then
had
i
caught
the
attention
of
the
police
looking
about
i
sought
durand
he
had
left
me
on
my
uncle
s
coming
up
but
had
remained
as
i
supposed
within
sight
but
at
this
moment
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
was
i
afraid
on
his
account
impossible
yet
happily
just
then
the
word
was
passed
about
that
the
police
had
given
orders
that
with
the
exception
of
such
as
had
been
requested
to
remain
to
answer
questions
the
guests
generally
should
feel
themselves
at
liberty
to
depart
the
time
had
now
come
to
take
a
stand
and
i
informed
my
uncle
to
his
evident
chagrin
that
i
should
not
leave
as
long
as
any
excuse
could
be
found
for
staying
he
said
nothing
at
the
time
but
as
the
noise
of
departing
carriages
gradually
lessened
and
the
great
hall
and
began
to
wear
a
look
of
desertion
he
at
last
ventured
on
this
gentle
protest
you
have
more
pluck
rita
than
i
supposed
do
you
think
it
wise
to
stay
on
here
will
not
people
imagine
that
you
have
been
requested
to
do
so
look
at
those
waiters
hanging
about
in
the
different
doorways
run
up
and
put
on
your
wraps
durand
will
come
to
the
house
fast
enough
as
soon
as
he
is
released
i
give
you
leave
to
sit
up
for
him
if
you
will
only
let
us
leave
this
place
before
that
impertinent
little
man
dares
to
come
around
again
he
artfully
added
but
i
stood
firm
though
somewhat
moved
by
his
final
suggestion
and
being
a
small
tyrant
in
my
way
at
least
with
him
i
carried
my
point
suddenly
my
anxiety
became
poignant
a
party
of
men
among
whom
i
saw
durand
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
hall
led
by
a
very
small
but
personage
whom
my
uncle
immediately
pointed
out
as
the
detective
who
had
twice
come
to
the
door
near
which
i
stood
as
this
man
looked
up
and
saw
me
still
there
a
look
of
relief
crossed
his
face
and
after
a
word
or
two
with
another
stranger
of
seeming
authority
he
detached
himself
from
the
group
he
had
ushered
upon
the
scene
and
approaching
me
respectfully
enough
said
with
a
deprecatory
glance
at
my
uncle
whose
frown
he
doubtless
understood
miss
van
arsdale
i
believe
i
nodded
too
choked
to
speak
i
am
sorry
madam
if
you
were
expecting
to
go
inspector
dalzell
has
arrived
and
would
like
to
speak
to
you
will
you
step
into
one
of
these
rooms
not
the
library
but
any
other
he
will
come
to
you
as
quickly
as
he
i
tried
to
carry
it
off
bravely
and
as
if
i
saw
nothing
in
this
summons
which
was
unique
or
alarming
but
i
succeeded
only
in
dividing
a
wavering
glance
between
him
and
the
group
of
men
of
which
he
had
just
formed
a
part
in
the
latter
were
several
gentlemen
whom
i
had
noted
in
fairbrother
s
train
early
in
the
evening
and
a
few
strangers
two
of
whom
were
officials
durand
was
with
the
former
and
his
expression
did
not
encourage
me
the
affair
is
very
serious
commented
the
detective
on
leaving
me
that
s
our
excuse
for
any
trouble
we
may
be
putting
you
i
clutched
my
uncle
s
arm
where
shall
we
go
i
asked
the
is
too
large
in
this
hall
my
eyes
are
for
ever
traveling
in
the
direction
of
the
alcove
don
t
you
know
some
little
room
oh
what
what
can
he
want
of
me
nothing
serious
nothing
important
blustered
my
good
uncle
some
triviality
such
as
you
can
answer
in
a
moment
a
little
room
yes
i
know
one
there
under
the
stairs
come
i
will
find
the
door
for
you
why
did
we
ever
come
to
this
wretched
ball
i
had
no
answer
for
this
why
indeed
my
uncle
who
is
a
very
patient
man
guided
me
to
the
place
he
had
picked
out
without
adding
a
word
to
the
ejaculation
in
which
he
had
just
allowed
his
impatience
to
expend
itself
but
once
seated
within
and
out
of
the
range
of
peering
eyes
and
listening
ears
he
allowed
a
sigh
to
escape
him
which
expressed
the
fullness
of
his
agitation
my
dear
he
began
and
stopped
i
feel
here
he
again
came
to
a
pause
that
you
should
know
what
i
managed
to
ask
that
i
do
not
like
durand
and
that
others
do
not
like
is
it
because
of
something
you
knew
about
him
before
he
made
no
answer
or
because
he
was
seen
like
many
other
gentlemen
talking
with
that
woman
some
time
before
a
long
time
before
she
was
attacked
for
her
diamond
and
murdered
pardon
me
my
dear
he
was
the
last
one
seen
talking
to
her
some
one
may
yet
be
found
who
went
in
after
he
came
out
but
as
yet
he
is
considered
the
last
ramsdell
himself
told
me
it
makes
no
difference
i
exclaimed
in
all
the
heat
of
my
agitation
i
am
willing
to
stake
my
life
on
his
integrity
and
honor
no
man
could
talk
to
me
as
he
did
early
this
evening
with
any
vile
intentions
at
heart
he
was
interested
no
doubt
like
many
others
in
one
who
had
the
name
of
being
a
captivating
woman
but
i
paused
in
sudden
alarm
a
look
had
crossed
my
uncle
s
face
which
assured
me
that
we
were
no
longer
alone
who
could
have
entered
so
silently
in
some
trepidation
i
turned
to
see
a
gentleman
was
standing
in
the
doorway
who
smiled
as
i
met
his
eye
is
this
miss
van
arsdale
he
asked
instantly
my
courage
which
had
threatened
to
leave
me
returned
and
i
smiled
i
am
said
i
are
you
the
inspector
inspector
dalzell
he
explained
with
a
bow
which
included
my
uncle
then
he
closed
the
door
i
hope
i
have
not
frightened
you
he
went
on
approaching
me
with
a
gentlemanly
air
a
little
matter
has
come
up
concerning
which
i
mean
to
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
it
may
prove
to
be
of
trivial
importance
if
so
you
will
pardon
my
disturbing
you
durand
you
know
him
i
am
engaged
to
him
i
declared
before
poor
uncle
could
raise
his
hand
you
are
engaged
to
him
well
that
makes
it
difficult
and
yet
in
some
respects
easier
for
me
to
ask
a
certain
it
must
have
made
it
more
difficult
than
easy
for
he
did
not
proceed
to
put
this
question
immediately
but
went
on
you
know
that
durand
visited
fairbrother
in
the
alcove
a
little
while
before
her
death
i
have
been
told
he
was
seen
to
go
in
but
i
have
not
yet
found
any
one
who
saw
him
come
out
consequently
we
have
been
unable
to
fix
the
exact
minute
when
he
did
so
what
is
the
matter
miss
van
arsdale
you
want
to
say
something
no
no
i
protested
reconsidering
my
first
impulse
then
as
i
met
his
look
he
can
probably
tell
you
that
himself
i
am
sure
he
would
not
we
shall
ask
him
later
was
the
inspector
s
response
meanwhile
are
you
ready
to
assure
me
that
since
that
time
he
has
not
intrusted
you
with
a
little
article
to
keep
no
no
i
do
not
mean
the
diamond
he
broke
in
in
very
evident
dismay
as
i
fell
back
from
him
in
irrepressible
indignation
and
alarm
the
diamond
well
we
shall
look
for
that
later
it
is
another
article
we
are
in
search
of
now
one
which
durand
might
very
well
have
taken
in
his
hand
without
realizing
just
what
he
was
doing
as
it
is
important
for
us
to
find
this
article
and
as
it
is
one
he
might
very
naturally
have
passed
over
to
you
when
he
found
himself
in
the
hall
with
it
in
his
hand
i
have
ventured
to
ask
you
if
this
surmise
is
it
is
not
i
retorted
fiercely
glad
that
i
could
speak
from
my
very
heart
he
has
given
me
nothing
to
keep
for
him
he
would
not
why
that
peculiar
look
in
the
inspector
s
eye
why
did
he
reach
out
for
a
chair
and
seat
me
in
it
before
he
took
up
my
interrupted
sentence
and
finished
it
would
not
give
you
anything
to
hold
which
had
belonged
to
another
woman
miss
van
arsdale
you
do
not
know
men
they
do
many
things
which
a
young
trusting
girl
like
yourself
would
hardly
expect
from
not
durand
i
maintained
stoutly
perhaps
not
let
us
hope
then
with
a
quick
change
of
manner
he
bent
toward
me
with
a
sidelong
look
at
uncle
and
pointing
to
my
gloves
remarked
you
wear
gloves
did
you
feel
the
need
of
two
pairs
that
you
carry
another
in
that
pretty
bag
hanging
from
your
arm
i
started
looked
down
and
then
slowly
drew
up
into
my
hand
the
bag
he
had
mentioned
the
white
finger
of
a
glove
was
protruding
from
the
top
any
one
could
see
it
many
probably
had
what
did
it
mean
i
had
brought
no
extra
pair
with
me
this
is
not
mine
i
began
faltering
into
silence
as
i
perceived
my
uncle
turn
and
walk
a
step
or
two
away
the
article
we
are
looking
for
pursued
the
inspector
is
a
pair
of
long
white
gloves
supposed
to
have
been
worn
by
fairbrother
when
she
entered
the
alcove
do
you
mind
showing
me
those
a
finger
of
which
i
see
i
dropped
the
bag
into
his
hand
the
room
and
everything
in
it
was
whirling
around
me
but
when
i
noted
what
trouble
it
was
to
his
clumsy
fingers
to
open
it
my
senses
returned
and
reaching
for
the
bag
i
pulled
it
open
and
snatched
out
the
gloves
they
had
been
hastily
rolled
up
and
some
of
the
fingers
were
showing
let
me
have
them
he
said
with
quaking
heart
and
shaking
fingers
i
handed
over
the
gloves
mrs
fairbrother
s
hand
was
not
a
small
one
he
observed
as
he
slowly
unrolled
them
yours
is
we
can
soon
tell
but
that
sentence
was
never
finished
as
the
gloves
fell
open
in
his
grasp
he
uttered
a
sudden
sharp
ejaculation
and
i
a
smothered
shriek
an
object
of
superlative
brilliancy
had
rolled
out
from
them
the
diamond
the
gem
which
men
said
was
worth
a
king
s
ransom
and
which
we
all
knew
had
just
cost
a
life
iii
anson
durand
with
benumbed
senses
and
a
dismayed
heart
i
stared
at
the
fallen
jewel
as
at
some
hateful
thing
menacing
both
my
life
and
honor
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
vehemently
declared
i
did
not
put
the
gloves
in
my
bag
nor
did
i
know
the
diamond
was
in
them
i
fainted
at
the
first
alarm
and
there
there
i
know
interposed
the
inspector
kindly
i
do
not
doubt
you
in
the
least
not
when
there
is
a
man
to
doubt
miss
van
arsdale
you
had
better
let
your
uncle
take
you
home
i
will
see
that
the
hall
is
cleared
for
you
tomorrow
i
may
wish
to
talk
to
you
again
but
i
will
spare
you
all
further
importunity
i
shook
my
head
it
would
require
more
courage
to
leave
at
that
moment
than
to
stay
meeting
the
inspector
s
eye
firmly
i
quietly
declared
if
durand
s
good
name
is
to
suffer
in
any
way
i
will
not
forsake
him
i
have
confidence
in
his
integrity
if
you
have
not
it
was
not
his
hand
but
one
much
more
guilty
which
dropped
this
jewel
into
the
so
so
do
not
be
too
sure
of
that
little
woman
you
had
better
take
your
lesson
at
once
it
will
be
easier
for
you
and
more
wholesome
for
here
he
picked
up
the
jewel
well
they
said
it
was
a
wonder
he
exclaimed
in
sudden
admiration
i
am
not
surprised
now
that
i
have
seen
a
great
gem
at
the
famous
stories
i
have
read
of
men
risking
life
and
honor
for
their
possession
if
only
no
blood
had
been
shed
uncle
uncle
i
wailed
aloud
in
my
agony
it
was
all
my
lips
could
utter
but
to
uncle
it
was
enough
speaking
for
the
first
time
he
asked
to
have
a
passage
made
for
us
and
when
the
inspector
moved
forward
to
comply
he
threw
his
arm
about
me
and
was
endeavoring
to
find
fitting
words
with
which
to
fill
up
the
delay
when
a
short
altercation
was
heard
from
the
doorway
and
durand
came
rushing
in
followed
immediately
by
the
inspector
his
first
look
was
not
at
myself
but
at
the
bag
which
still
hung
from
my
arm
as
i
noted
this
action
my
whole
inner
self
seemed
to
collapse
dragging
my
happiness
down
with
it
but
my
countenance
remained
unchanged
too
much
so
it
seems
for
when
his
eye
finally
rose
to
my
face
he
found
there
what
made
him
recoil
and
turn
with
something
like
fierceness
on
his
companion
you
have
been
talking
to
her
he
vehemently
protested
perhaps
you
have
gone
further
than
that
what
has
happened
here
i
think
i
ought
to
know
she
is
so
guileless
inspector
dalzell
so
perfectly
free
from
all
connection
with
this
crime
why
have
you
shut
her
up
here
and
plied
her
with
questions
and
made
her
look
at
me
with
such
an
expression
when
all
you
have
against
me
is
just
what
you
have
against
some
others
that
i
was
weak
enough
or
unfortunate
enough
to
spend
a
few
minutes
with
that
unhappy
woman
in
the
alcove
before
she
died
it
might
be
well
if
miss
van
arsdale
herself
would
answer
you
was
the
inspector
s
quiet
retort
what
you
have
said
may
constitute
all
that
we
have
against
you
but
it
is
not
all
we
have
against
i
gasped
not
so
much
at
this
seeming
accusation
the
motive
of
which
i
believed
myself
to
understand
but
at
the
burning
blush
with
which
it
was
received
by
durand
what
do
you
mean
he
demanded
with
certain
odd
breaks
in
his
voice
what
can
you
have
against
her
a
triviality
returned
the
inspector
with
a
look
in
my
direction
that
was
i
felt
not
to
be
mistaken
i
do
not
call
it
a
triviality
i
burst
out
it
seems
that
fairbrother
for
all
her
elaborate
toilet
was
found
without
gloves
on
her
arms
as
she
certainly
wore
them
on
entering
the
alcove
the
police
have
naturally
been
looking
for
them
and
where
do
you
think
they
have
found
them
not
in
the
alcove
with
her
not
in
the
possession
of
the
man
who
undoubtedly
carried
them
away
with
him
but
i
know
i
know
durand
hoarsely
put
in
you
need
not
say
any
more
oh
my
poor
rita
what
have
i
brought
upon
you
by
my
weakness
weakness
he
started
i
started
my
voice
was
totally
unrecognizable
i
should
give
it
another
name
i
added
coldly
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
lose
heart
then
he
lifted
his
head
again
and
looked
as
handsome
as
when
he
pleaded
for
my
hand
in
the
little
conservatory
you
have
that
right
said
he
besides
weakness
at
such
a
time
and
under
such
an
exigency
is
little
short
of
wrong
it
was
unmanly
in
me
to
endeavor
to
secrete
these
gloves
more
than
unmanly
for
me
to
choose
for
their
the
recesses
of
an
article
belonging
exclusively
to
yourself
i
acknowledge
it
rita
and
shall
meet
only
my
just
punishment
if
you
deny
me
in
the
future
both
your
sympathy
and
regard
but
you
must
let
me
assure
you
and
these
gentlemen
also
one
of
whom
can
make
it
very
unpleasant
for
me
that
consideration
for
you
much
more
than
any
miserable
anxiety
about
myself
lay
at
the
bottom
of
what
must
strike
you
all
as
an
act
of
unpardonable
cowardice
from
the
moment
i
learned
of
this
woman
s
murder
in
the
alcove
where
i
had
visited
her
i
realized
that
every
one
who
had
been
seen
to
approach
her
within
a
of
her
death
would
be
subjected
to
a
more
or
less
rigid
investigation
and
i
feared
if
her
gloves
were
found
in
my
possession
some
special
attention
might
be
directed
my
way
which
would
cause
you
unmerited
distress
so
yielding
to
an
impulse
which
i
now
recognize
as
a
most
unwise
as
well
as
unworthy
one
i
took
advantage
of
the
bustle
about
us
and
of
the
insensibility
into
which
you
had
fallen
to
tuck
these
miserable
gloves
into
the
bag
i
saw
lying
on
the
floor
at
your
side
i
do
not
ask
your
pardon
my
whole
future
life
shall
be
devoted
to
winning
that
i
simply
wish
to
state
a
very
good
it
was
the
inspector
who
spoke
i
could
not
have
uttered
a
word
to
save
my
life
perhaps
you
will
now
feel
that
you
owe
it
to
this
young
lady
to
add
how
you
came
to
have
these
gloves
in
your
possession
mrs
fairbrother
handed
them
to
handed
them
to
you
yes
i
hardly
know
why
myself
she
asked
me
to
take
care
of
them
for
her
i
know
that
this
must
strike
you
as
a
very
peculiar
statement
it
was
my
realization
of
the
unfavorable
effect
it
could
not
fail
to
produce
upon
those
who
beard
it
which
made
me
dread
any
interrogation
on
the
subject
but
i
assure
you
it
was
as
i
say
she
put
the
gloves
into
my
hand
while
i
was
talking
to
her
saying
they
incommoded
and
you
well
i
held
them
for
a
few
minutes
then
i
put
them
in
my
pocket
but
quite
automatically
and
without
thinking
very
much
about
it
she
was
a
woman
accustomed
to
have
her
own
way
people
seldom
questioned
it
i
here
the
tension
about
my
throat
relaxed
and
i
opened
my
lips
to
speak
but
the
inspector
with
a
glance
of
some
authority
forestalled
me
were
the
gloves
open
or
rolled
up
when
she
offered
them
to
you
they
were
rolled
did
you
see
her
take
them
off
and
roll
them
up
after
which
she
passed
them
over
to
you
not
immediately
she
let
them
lie
in
her
lap
for
a
while
you
talked
durand
bowed
and
looked
at
the
diamond
durand
bowed
for
the
second
time
had
you
ever
seen
so
fine
a
diamond
before
yet
you
deal
in
precious
stones
that
is
my
and
are
regarded
as
a
judge
of
them
i
have
that
mr
durand
would
you
know
this
diamond
if
you
saw
it
i
certainly
the
setting
was
an
uncommon
one
i
quite
an
unusual
the
inspector
opened
his
hand
is
this
the
article
good
god
where
don
t
you
know
i
do
the
inspector
eyed
him
gravely
then
i
have
a
bit
of
news
for
you
it
was
hidden
in
the
gloves
you
took
from
fairbrother
miss
van
arsdale
was
present
at
their
do
we
live
move
breathe
at
certain
moments
it
hardly
seems
so
i
know
that
i
was
conscious
of
but
one
sense
that
of
seeing
and
of
but
one
faculty
that
of
judgment
would
he
flinch
break
down
betray
guilt
or
simply
show
astonishment
i
chose
to
believe
it
was
the
latter
feeling
only
which
informed
his
slowly
whitening
and
disturbed
features
certainly
it
was
all
his
words
expressed
as
his
glances
flew
from
the
stone
to
the
gloves
and
back
again
to
the
inspector
s
face
i
can
not
believe
it
i
can
not
believe
and
his
hand
flew
wildly
to
his
forehead
yet
it
is
the
truth
durand
and
one
you
have
now
to
face
how
will
you
do
this
by
any
further
explanations
or
by
what
you
may
consider
a
discreet
silence
i
have
nothing
to
explain
the
facts
are
as
i
have
the
inspector
regarded
him
with
an
earnestness
which
made
my
heart
sink
you
can
fix
the
time
of
this
visit
i
hope
tell
us
i
mean
just
when
you
left
the
alcove
you
must
have
seen
some
one
who
can
speak
for
i
fear
why
did
he
look
so
disturbed
and
uncertain
there
were
but
few
persons
in
the
hall
just
then
he
went
on
to
explain
no
one
was
sitting
on
the
yellow
you
know
where
you
went
though
whom
you
saw
and
what
you
did
before
the
alarm
spread
inspector
i
am
quite
confused
i
did
go
somewhere
i
did
not
remain
in
that
part
of
the
hall
but
i
can
tell
you
nothing
definite
save
that
i
walked
about
mostly
among
strangers
till
the
cry
rose
which
sent
us
all
in
one
direction
and
me
to
the
side
of
my
fainting
can
you
pick
out
any
stranger
you
talked
to
or
any
one
who
might
have
noted
you
during
this
interval
you
see
for
the
sake
of
this
little
woman
i
wish
to
give
you
every
inspector
i
am
obliged
to
throw
myself
on
your
mercy
i
have
no
such
witness
to
my
innocence
as
you
call
for
innocent
people
seldom
have
it
is
only
the
guilty
who
take
the
trouble
to
provide
for
such
this
was
all
very
well
if
it
had
been
uttered
with
a
straightforward
air
and
in
a
clear
tone
but
it
was
not
i
who
loved
him
felt
that
it
was
not
and
consequently
was
more
or
less
prepared
for
the
change
which
now
took
place
in
the
inspector
s
manner
yet
it
pierced
me
to
the
heart
to
observe
this
change
and
i
instinctively
dropped
my
face
into
my
hands
when
i
saw
him
move
toward
durand
with
some
final
order
or
word
of
caution
instantly
and
who
can
account
for
such
phenomena
there
floated
into
view
before
my
retina
a
reproduction
of
the
picture
i
had
seen
or
imagined
myself
to
have
seen
in
the
and
as
at
that
time
it
opened
before
me
an
unknown
vista
quite
removed
from
the
surrounding
scene
so
it
did
now
and
i
beheld
again
in
faint
outlines
and
yet
with
the
effect
of
complete
distinctness
a
square
of
light
through
which
appeared
an
open
passage
partly
shut
off
from
view
by
a
curtain
and
the
tall
figure
of
a
man
holding
back
this
curtain
and
gazing
or
seeming
to
gaze
at
his
own
breast
on
which
he
had
already
laid
one
quivering
finger
what
did
it
mean
in
the
excitement
of
the
horrible
occurrence
which
had
engrossed
us
all
i
had
forgotten
this
curious
experience
but
on
feeling
anew
the
vague
sensation
of
shock
and
expectation
which
seemed
its
natural
accompaniment
i
became
conscious
of
a
sudden
conviction
that
the
picture
which
had
opened
before
me
in
the
was
the
result
of
a
reflection
in
a
glass
or
mirror
of
something
then
going
on
in
a
place
not
otherwise
within
the
reach
of
my
vision
a
reflection
the
importance
of
which
i
suddenly
realized
when
i
recalled
at
what
a
critical
moment
it
had
occurred
a
man
in
a
state
of
dread
looking
at
his
breast
within
five
minutes
of
the
stir
and
rush
of
the
dreadful
event
which
had
marked
this
evening
a
hope
great
as
the
despair
in
which
i
had
just
been
sunk
gave
me
courage
to
drop
my
hands
and
advance
impetuously
toward
the
inspector
don
t
speak
i
pray
don
t
judge
any
of
us
further
till
you
have
heard
what
i
have
to
in
great
astonishment
and
with
an
aspect
of
some
severity
he
asked
me
what
i
had
to
say
now
which
i
had
not
had
the
opportunity
of
saying
before
i
replied
with
all
the
passion
of
a
forlorn
hope
that
it
was
only
at
this
present
moment
i
remembered
a
fact
which
might
have
a
very
decided
bearing
on
this
case
and
detecting
evidences
as
i
thought
of
relenting
on
his
part
i
backed
up
this
statement
by
an
entreaty
for
a
few
words
with
him
apart
as
the
matter
i
had
to
tell
was
private
and
possibly
too
fanciful
for
any
ear
but
his
own
he
looked
as
if
he
apprehended
some
loss
of
valuable
time
but
touched
by
the
involuntary
gesture
of
appeal
with
which
i
supplemented
my
request
he
led
me
into
a
corner
where
with
just
an
encouraging
glance
toward
durand
who
seemed
struck
dumb
by
my
action
i
told
the
inspector
of
that
momentary
picture
which
i
had
seen
reflected
in
what
i
was
now
sure
was
some
or
mirror
it
was
at
a
time
coincident
or
very
nearly
coincident
with
the
perpetration
of
the
crime
you
are
now
investigating
i
concluded
within
five
minutes
afterward
came
the
shout
which
roused
us
all
to
what
had
happened
in
the
alcove
i
do
not
know
what
passage
i
saw
or
what
door
or
even
what
figure
but
the
latter
i
am
sure
was
that
of
the
guilty
man
something
in
the
outline
and
it
was
the
outline
only
i
could
catch
expressed
an
emotion
incomprehensible
to
me
at
the
moment
but
which
in
my
remembrance
impresses
me
as
that
of
fear
and
dread
it
was
not
the
entrance
to
the
alcove
i
beheld
that
would
have
struck
me
at
once
but
some
other
opening
which
i
might
recognize
if
i
saw
it
can
not
that
opening
be
found
and
may
it
not
give
a
clue
to
the
man
i
saw
skulking
through
it
with
terror
and
remorse
in
his
heart
was
this
figure
when
you
saw
it
turned
toward
you
or
away
the
inspector
inquired
with
unexpected
interest
turned
partly
away
he
was
going
from
and
you
sat
where
shall
i
show
you
the
inspector
bowed
then
with
a
low
word
of
caution
turned
to
my
uncle
i
am
going
to
take
this
young
lady
into
the
hall
for
a
moment
at
her
own
request
may
i
ask
you
and
durand
to
await
me
here
without
pausing
for
reply
he
threw
open
the
door
and
presently
we
were
pacing
the
deserted
seeking
the
place
where
i
had
sat
i
found
it
almost
by
a
miracle
everything
being
in
great
disorder
guided
by
my
bouquet
which
i
had
left
behind
me
in
my
escape
from
the
table
i
laid
hold
of
the
chair
before
which
it
lay
and
declared
quite
confidently
to
the
inspector
this
is
where
i
naturally
his
glance
and
mine
both
flew
to
the
opposite
wall
a
window
was
before
us
of
an
unusual
size
and
make
unlike
any
which
had
ever
before
come
under
my
observation
it
swung
on
a
pivot
and
though
shut
at
the
present
moment
might
very
easily
when
opened
present
its
huge
pane
at
an
angle
capable
of
catching
reflections
from
some
of
the
many
mirrors
decorating
the
situated
diagonally
across
the
hall
as
all
the
doorways
on
this
lower
floor
were
of
unusual
width
an
open
path
was
offered
as
it
were
for
these
reflections
to
pass
making
it
possible
for
scenes
to
be
imaged
here
which
to
the
persons
involved
would
seem
as
safe
from
any
one
s
scrutiny
as
if
they
were
taking
place
in
the
adjoining
house
as
we
realized
this
a
look
passed
between
us
of
more
than
ordinary
significance
pointing
to
the
window
the
inspector
turned
to
a
group
of
waiters
watching
us
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
asked
if
it
had
been
opened
that
evening
the
answer
came
quickly
yes
sir
just
before
the
the
i
understand
broke
in
the
inspector
and
leaning
over
me
he
whispered
tell
me
again
exactly
what
you
thought
you
but
i
could
add
little
to
my
former
description
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
this
he
kindly
persisted
was
the
picture
when
you
saw
it
on
a
level
with
your
eye
or
did
you
have
to
lift
your
head
in
order
to
see
it
it
was
high
up
in
the
air
as
it
were
that
seemed
its
oddest
the
inspector
s
mouth
took
a
satisfied
curve
possibly
i
might
identify
the
door
and
passage
if
i
saw
them
i
suggested
certainly
certainly
was
his
cheerful
rejoinder
and
summoning
one
of
his
men
he
was
about
to
give
some
order
when
his
impulse
changed
and
he
asked
if
i
could
draw
i
assured
him
in
some
surprise
that
i
was
far
from
being
an
adept
in
that
direction
but
that
possibly
i
might
manage
a
rough
sketch
whereupon
he
pulled
a
pad
and
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
requested
me
to
make
some
sort
of
attempt
to
reproduce
on
paper
my
memory
of
this
passage
and
the
door
my
heart
was
beating
violently
and
the
pencil
shook
in
my
hand
but
i
knew
that
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
show
any
hesitation
in
fixing
for
all
eyes
what
unaccountably
to
myself
continued
to
be
perfectly
plain
to
my
own
so
i
endeavored
to
do
as
he
bade
me
and
succeeded
to
some
extent
for
he
uttered
a
slight
ejaculation
at
one
of
its
features
and
while
duly
expressing
his
thanks
honored
me
with
a
very
sharp
look
is
this
your
first
visit
to
this
house
he
asked
no
i
have
been
here
in
the
evening
or
in
the
afternoon
in
the
i
am
told
that
the
main
entrance
is
not
in
use
no
a
side
door
is
provided
for
occasions
like
the
present
guests
entering
there
find
a
special
hall
and
staircase
by
which
they
can
reach
the
upstairs
without
crossing
the
main
hall
is
that
what
you
mean
yes
that
is
what
i
i
stared
at
him
in
wonder
what
lay
back
of
such
questions
as
these
you
came
in
as
others
did
by
this
side
entrance
he
now
proceeded
did
you
notice
as
you
turned
to
go
up
stairs
an
arch
opening
into
a
small
passageway
at
your
left
i
did
not
i
began
flushing
for
i
thought
i
understood
him
now
i
was
too
eager
to
reach
the
to
look
about
very
well
he
replied
i
may
want
to
show
you
that
the
outline
of
an
arch
backing
the
figure
we
were
endeavoring
to
identify
was
a
marked
feature
in
the
sketch
i
had
shown
him
will
you
take
a
seat
near
by
while
i
make
a
study
of
this
matter
i
turned
with
alacrity
to
obey
there
was
something
in
his
air
and
manner
which
made
me
almost
buoyant
had
my
fanciful
interpretation
of
what
i
had
seen
reached
him
with
the
conviction
it
had
me
if
so
there
was
hope
hope
for
the
man
i
loved
who
had
gone
in
and
out
between
curtains
and
not
through
any
arch
such
as
he
had
mentioned
or
i
had
described
providence
was
working
for
me
i
saw
it
in
the
way
the
men
now
moved
about
swinging
the
window
to
and
fro
under
the
instruction
of
the
inspector
manipulating
the
lights
opening
doors
and
drawing
back
curtains
providence
was
working
for
me
and
when
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
asked
to
reseat
myself
in
my
old
place
at
the
and
take
another
look
in
that
slightly
deflected
glass
i
knew
that
my
effort
had
met
with
its
reward
and
that
for
the
second
time
i
was
to
receive
the
impression
of
a
place
now
indelibly
imprinted
on
my
consciousness
is
not
that
it
asked
the
inspector
pointing
at
the
glass
with
a
last
look
at
the
imperfect
sketch
i
had
made
him
and
which
he
still
held
in
his
hand
yes
i
eagerly
responded
all
but
the
man
he
whose
figure
i
see
there
is
another
person
entirely
i
see
no
remorse
or
even
fear
in
his
of
course
not
you
are
looking
at
the
reflection
of
one
of
my
men
miss
van
arsdale
do
you
recognize
the
place
now
under
your
eye
i
do
not
you
spoke
of
an
arch
in
the
hall
at
the
left
of
the
carriage
entrance
and
i
see
an
arch
in
the
before
me
but
you
are
looking
straight
through
the
alcove
perhaps
you
did
not
know
that
another
door
opened
at
its
back
into
the
passage
which
runs
behind
it
farther
on
is
the
arch
and
beyond
that
arch
the
side
hall
and
staircase
leading
to
the
this
door
the
one
in
the
rear
of
the
alcove
i
mean
is
hidden
from
those
entering
from
the
main
hall
by
draperies
which
have
been
hung
over
it
for
this
occasion
but
it
is
quite
visible
from
the
back
passageway
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
by
its
means
the
man
whose
reflected
image
you
saw
both
entered
and
left
the
alcove
it
is
an
important
fact
to
establish
and
we
feel
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
aid
you
have
given
us
in
this
then
as
i
continued
to
stare
at
him
in
my
elation
and
surprise
he
added
in
quick
explanation
the
lights
in
the
alcove
and
in
the
several
parlors
are
all
hung
with
shades
as
you
must
perceive
but
the
one
in
the
hall
beyond
the
arch
is
very
bright
which
accounts
for
the
distinctness
of
this
double
reflection
another
thing
and
it
is
a
very
interesting
point
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
this
reflection
to
be
noticeable
from
where
you
sit
if
the
level
of
the
alcove
flooring
had
not
been
considerably
higher
than
that
of
the
main
floor
but
for
this
freak
of
the
architect
the
continual
passing
to
and
fro
of
people
would
have
prevented
the
reflection
in
its
passage
from
surface
to
surface
miss
van
arsdale
it
would
seem
that
by
one
of
those
chances
which
happen
but
once
or
twice
in
a
lifetime
every
condition
was
propitious
at
the
moment
to
make
this
reflection
a
possible
occurrence
even
the
location
and
width
of
the
several
doorways
and
the
exact
point
at
which
the
portiere
was
drawn
aside
from
the
entrance
to
the
it
is
wonderful
i
cried
wonderful
then
to
his
astonishment
perhaps
i
asked
if
there
was
not
a
small
door
of
communication
between
the
passageway
back
of
the
alcove
and
the
large
central
hall
yes
he
replied
it
opens
just
beyond
the
fireplace
three
small
steps
lead
to
i
thought
so
i
murmured
but
more
to
myself
than
to
him
in
my
mind
i
was
thinking
how
a
man
if
he
so
wished
could
pass
from
the
very
heart
of
this
assemblage
into
the
quiet
passageway
and
so
on
into
the
alcove
without
attracting
very
much
attention
from
his
fellow
guests
i
forgot
that
there
was
another
way
of
approach
even
less
noticeable
that
by
the
small
staircase
running
up
beyond
the
arch
directly
to
the
that
no
confusion
may
arise
in
any
one
s
mind
in
regard
to
these
curious
approaches
i
subjoin
a
plan
of
this
portion
of
the
lower
floor
as
it
afterward
appeared
in
the
leading
dailies
and
durand
i
stammered
as
i
followed
the
inspector
back
to
the
room
where
we
had
left
that
gentleman
you
will
believe
his
statement
now
and
look
for
this
second
intruder
with
the
head
and
frightened
mien
yes
he
replied
stopping
me
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
and
taking
my
hand
kindly
in
his
if
don
t
start
my
dear
life
is
full
of
trouble
for
young
and
old
and
youth
is
the
best
time
to
face
a
sad
experience
if
he
is
not
himself
the
man
you
saw
staring
in
frightened
horror
at
his
breast
have
you
not
noticed
that
he
is
not
dressed
in
all
respects
like
the
other
gentlemen
present
that
though
he
has
not
donned
his
overcoat
he
has
put
on
somewhat
prematurely
one
might
say
the
large
silk
handkerchief
lie
presumably
wears
under
it
have
you
not
noticed
this
and
asked
yourself
why
i
had
noticed
it
i
had
noticed
it
from
the
moment
i
recovered
from
my
fainting
fit
but
i
had
not
thought
it
a
matter
of
sufficient
interest
to
ask
even
of
myself
his
reason
for
thus
hiding
his
now
i
could
not
my
faculties
were
too
confused
my
heart
too
deeply
shaken
by
the
suggestion
which
the
inspector
s
words
conveyed
for
me
to
be
conscious
of
anything
but
the
devouring
question
as
to
what
i
should
do
if
by
my
own
mistaken
zeal
i
had
succeeded
in
plunging
the
man
i
loved
yet
deeper
into
the
toils
in
which
he
had
become
enmeshed
the
inspector
left
me
no
time
for
the
settlement
of
this
question
ushering
me
back
into
the
room
where
durand
and
my
uncle
awaited
our
return
in
apparently
unrelieved
silence
he
closed
the
door
upon
the
curious
eyes
of
the
various
persons
still
lingering
in
the
hall
and
abruptly
said
to
durand
the
explanations
you
have
been
pleased
to
give
of
the
manner
in
which
this
diamond
came
into
your
possession
are
not
too
fanciful
for
credence
if
you
can
satisfy
us
on
another
point
which
has
awakened
some
doubt
in
the
mind
of
one
of
my
men
durand
you
appear
to
have
prepared
yourself
for
departure
somewhat
prematurely
do
you
mind
removing
that
handkerchief
for
a
moment
my
reason
for
so
peculiar
a
request
will
presently
alas
for
my
last
fond
hope
durand
with
a
face
as
white
as
the
background
of
snow
framed
by
the
uncurtained
window
against
which
he
leaned
lifted
his
hand
as
if
to
comply
with
the
inspector
s
request
then
let
it
fall
again
with
a
grating
laugh
i
see
that
i
am
not
likely
to
escape
any
of
the
results
of
my
imprudence
he
cried
and
with
a
quick
jerk
bared
his
a
splash
of
red
defiled
its
otherwise
uniform
whiteness
that
it
was
the
red
of
heart
s
blood
was
proved
by
the
shrinking
look
he
unconsciously
cast
at
it
iv
explanations
my
love
for
anson
durand
died
at
sight
of
that
crimson
splash
or
i
thought
it
did
in
this
spot
of
blood
on
the
breast
of
him
to
whom
i
had
given
my
heart
i
could
read
but
one
word
guilt
heinous
guilt
guilt
denied
and
now
brought
to
light
in
language
that
could
be
seen
and
read
by
all
men
why
should
i
stay
in
such
a
presence
had
not
the
inspector
himself
advised
me
to
go
yes
but
another
voice
bade
me
remain
just
as
i
reached
the
door
anson
durand
found
his
voice
and
i
heard
in
the
full
sweet
tones
i
loved
so
well
wait
i
am
not
to
be
judged
like
this
i
will
explain
but
here
the
inspector
interposed
do
you
think
it
wise
to
make
any
such
attempt
without
the
advice
of
counsel
durand
the
indignation
with
which
durand
wheeled
toward
him
raised
in
me
a
faint
hope
good
god
yes
he
cried
would
you
have
me
leave
miss
van
arsdale
one
minute
longer
than
is
necessary
to
such
dreadful
doubts
rita
miss
van
arsdale
weakness
and
weakness
only
has
brought
me
into
my
present
position
i
did
not
kill
fairbrother
nor
did
i
knowingly
take
her
diamond
though
appearances
look
that
way
as
i
am
very
ready
to
acknowledge
i
did
go
to
her
in
the
alcove
not
once
but
twice
and
these
are
my
reasons
for
doing
so
about
three
months
ago
a
certain
man
of
enormous
wealth
came
to
me
with
the
request
that
i
should
procure
for
him
a
diamond
of
superior
beauty
he
wished
to
give
it
to
his
wife
and
he
wished
it
to
outshine
any
which
could
now
be
found
in
new
york
this
meant
sending
abroad
an
expense
he
was
quite
willing
to
incur
on
the
sole
condition
that
the
stone
should
not
disappoint
him
when
he
saw
it
and
that
it
was
to
be
in
his
hands
on
the
eighteenth
of
march
his
wife
s
birthday
never
before
had
i
had
such
an
opportunity
for
a
large
stroke
of
business
naturally
elated
i
entered
at
once
into
correspondence
with
the
best
known
dealers
on
the
other
side
and
last
week
a
diamond
was
delivered
to
me
which
seemed
to
fill
all
the
necessary
requirements
i
had
never
seen
a
finer
stone
and
was
consequently
rejoicing
in
my
success
when
some
one
i
do
not
remember
who
now
chanced
to
speak
in
my
hearing
of
the
wonderful
stone
possessed
by
a
certain
fairbrother
a
stone
so
large
so
brilliant
and
so
precious
altogether
that
she
seldom
wore
it
though
it
was
known
to
connoisseurs
and
had
a
great
reputation
at
tiffany
s
where
it
had
once
been
sent
for
some
alteration
in
the
setting
was
this
stone
larger
and
finer
than
the
one
i
had
procured
with
so
much
trouble
if
so
my
labor
had
all
been
in
vain
for
my
patron
must
have
known
of
this
diamond
and
would
expect
to
see
it
surpassed
i
was
so
upset
by
this
possibility
that
i
resolved
to
see
the
jewel
and
make
comparisons
for
myself
i
found
a
friend
who
agreed
to
introduce
me
to
the
lady
she
received
me
very
graciously
and
was
amiable
enough
until
the
subject
of
diamonds
was
broached
when
she
immediately
stiffened
and
left
me
without
an
opportunity
of
proffering
my
request
however
on
every
other
subject
she
was
affable
and
i
found
it
easy
enough
to
pursue
the
acquaintance
till
we
were
almost
on
friendly
terms
but
i
never
saw
the
diamond
nor
would
she
talk
about
it
though
i
caused
her
some
surprise
when
one
day
i
drew
out
before
her
eyes
the
one
i
had
procured
for
my
patron
and
made
her
look
at
it
fine
she
cried
fine
but
i
failed
to
detect
any
envy
in
her
manner
and
so
knew
that
i
had
not
achieved
the
object
set
me
by
my
wealthy
customer
this
was
a
woeful
disappointment
yet
as
fairbrother
never
wore
her
diamond
it
was
among
the
possibilities
that
he
might
be
satisfied
with
the
very
fine
gem
i
had
obtained
for
him
and
influenced
by
this
hope
i
sent
him
this
morning
a
request
to
come
and
see
it
tomorrow
tonight
i
attended
this
ball
and
almost
as
soon
as
i
enter
the
i
hear
that
fairbrother
is
present
and
is
wearing
her
famous
jewel
what
could
you
expect
of
me
why
that
i
would
make
an
effort
to
see
it
and
so
be
ready
with
a
reply
to
my
exacting
customer
when
he
should
ask
me
if
the
stone
i
showed
him
had
its
peer
in
the
city
but
was
not
in
the
then
and
later
i
became
interested
elsewhere
here
he
cast
a
look
at
me
so
that
half
the
evening
passed
before
i
had
an
opportunity
to
join
her
in
the
alcove
where
i
had
seen
her
set
up
her
miniature
court
what
passed
between
us
in
the
short
interview
we
held
together
you
will
find
me
prepared
to
state
if
necessary
it
was
chiefly
marked
by
the
one
short
view
i
succeeded
in
obtaining
of
her
marvelous
diamond
in
spite
of
the
pains
she
took
to
hide
it
from
me
by
some
natural
movement
whenever
she
caught
my
eyes
leaving
her
face
but
in
that
one
short
look
i
had
seen
enough
this
was
a
gem
for
a
collector
not
to
be
worn
save
in
a
royal
presence
how
had
she
come
by
it
and
could
smythe
expect
me
to
procure
him
a
stone
like
that
in
my
confusion
i
arose
to
depart
but
the
lady
showed
a
disposition
to
keep
me
and
began
chatting
so
vivaciously
that
i
scarcely
noticed
that
she
was
all
the
time
engaged
in
drawing
off
her
gloves
indeed
i
almost
forgot
the
jewel
possibly
because
her
movements
hid
it
so
completely
and
only
remembered
it
when
with
a
sudden
turn
from
the
window
where
she
had
drawn
me
to
watch
the
falling
flakes
she
pressed
the
gloves
into
my
hand
with
the
coquettish
request
that
i
should
take
care
of
them
for
her
i
remember
as
i
took
them
of
striving
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
the
stone
whose
brilliancy
had
dazzled
me
but
she
had
opened
her
fan
between
us
a
moment
after
thinking
i
heard
approaching
steps
i
quitted
the
room
this
was
my
first
as
he
stopped
possibly
for
breath
possibly
to
judge
to
what
extent
i
was
impressed
by
his
account
the
inspector
seized
the
opportunity
to
ask
if
fairbrother
had
been
standing
any
of
this
time
with
her
back
to
him
to
which
he
answered
yes
while
they
were
in
the
window
long
enough
for
her
to
pluck
off
the
jewel
and
thrust
it
into
the
gloves
if
she
had
so
wished
quite
long
but
you
did
not
see
her
do
this
i
did
and
so
took
the
gloves
without
suspicion
entirely
and
carried
them
away
unfortunately
without
thinking
that
she
might
want
them
the
next
minute
i
doubt
if
i
was
thinking
seriously
of
her
at
all
my
thoughts
were
on
my
own
did
you
carry
these
gloves
out
in
your
hand
no
in
my
i
see
and
you
met
no
one
the
sound
i
heard
must
have
come
from
the
rear
and
there
was
nobody
on
the
steps
no
a
gentleman
was
standing
at
their
foot
grey
the
englishman
but
his
face
was
turned
another
way
and
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
in
that
same
position
for
several
did
this
gentleman
grey
see
you
i
can
not
say
but
i
doubt
it
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
sort
of
dream
there
were
other
people
about
but
nobody
with
whom
i
was
very
good
now
for
the
second
visit
you
acknowledge
having
paid
this
unfortunate
the
inspector
s
voice
was
hard
i
clung
a
little
more
tightly
to
my
uncle
and
durand
after
one
agonizing
glance
my
way
drew
himself
up
as
if
quite
conscious
that
he
had
entered
upon
the
most
serious
part
of
the
struggle
i
had
forgotten
the
gloves
in
my
hurried
departure
but
presently
i
remembered
them
and
grew
very
uneasy
i
did
not
like
carrying
this
woman
s
property
about
with
me
i
had
engaged
myself
an
hour
before
to
miss
van
arsdale
and
was
very
anxious
to
rejoin
her
the
gloves
worried
me
and
finally
after
a
little
aimless
wandering
through
the
various
rooms
i
determined
to
go
back
and
restore
them
to
their
owner
the
doors
of
the
had
just
been
flung
open
and
the
end
of
the
hall
near
the
alcove
was
comparatively
empty
save
for
a
certain
quizzical
friend
of
mine
whom
i
saw
sitting
with
his
partner
on
the
yellow
divan
i
did
not
want
to
encounter
him
just
then
for
he
had
already
joked
me
about
my
admiration
for
the
lady
with
the
diamond
and
so
i
conceived
the
idea
of
approaching
her
by
means
of
a
second
entrance
to
the
alcove
unsuspected
by
most
of
those
present
but
perfectly
to
me
who
have
been
a
frequent
guest
in
this
house
a
door
covered
by
temporary
draperies
connects
as
you
may
know
this
alcove
with
a
passageway
communicating
directly
with
the
hall
of
entrance
and
the
to
go
up
the
main
stairs
and
come
down
by
the
side
one
and
so
on
through
a
small
archway
was
a
very
simple
matter
for
me
if
no
or
late
arriving
guests
were
in
that
hall
i
need
fear
but
one
encounter
and
that
was
with
the
servant
stationed
at
the
carriage
entrance
but
even
he
was
absent
at
this
propitious
instant
and
i
reached
the
door
i
sought
without
any
unpleasantness
this
door
opened
out
instead
of
in
this
i
also
knew
when
planning
this
surreptitious
intrusion
but
after
pulling
it
open
and
reaching
for
the
curtain
which
hung
completely
across
it
i
found
it
not
so
easy
to
proceed
as
i
had
imagined
the
stealthiness
of
my
action
held
back
my
hand
then
the
faint
sounds
i
heard
within
advised
me
that
she
was
not
alone
and
that
she
might
very
readily
regard
with
displeasure
my
unexpected
entrance
by
a
door
of
which
she
was
possibly
ignorant
i
tell
you
all
this
because
if
by
any
chance
i
was
seen
hesitating
in
face
of
that
curtain
doubts
might
have
been
raised
which
i
am
anxious
to
here
his
eyes
left
my
face
for
that
of
the
inspector
it
certainly
had
a
bad
look
that
i
don
t
deny
but
i
did
not
think
of
appearances
then
i
was
too
anxious
to
complete
a
task
which
had
suddenly
presented
unexpected
difficulties
that
i
listened
before
entering
was
very
natural
and
when
i
heard
no
voice
only
something
like
a
great
sigh
i
ventured
to
lift
the
curtain
and
step
in
she
was
sitting
not
where
i
had
left
her
but
on
a
couch
at
the
left
of
the
usual
entrance
her
face
toward
me
and
you
know
how
inspector
it
was
her
last
sigh
i
had
heard
horrified
for
i
had
never
looked
on
death
before
much
less
crime
i
reeled
forward
meaning
i
presume
to
rush
down
the
steps
shouting
for
help
when
suddenly
something
fell
splashing
on
my
and
i
saw
myself
marked
with
a
stain
of
blood
this
both
frightened
and
bewildered
me
and
it
was
a
minute
or
two
before
i
had
the
courage
to
look
up
when
i
did
do
so
i
saw
whence
this
drop
had
come
not
from
her
though
the
red
stream
was
pouring
down
the
rich
folds
of
her
dress
but
from
a
sharp
instrument
which
had
been
thrust
point
downward
in
the
open
work
of
an
antique
lantern
hanging
near
the
doorway
what
had
happened
to
me
might
have
happened
to
any
one
who
chanced
to
be
in
that
spot
at
that
special
moment
but
i
did
not
realize
this
then
covering
the
splash
with
my
hands
i
edged
myself
back
to
the
door
by
which
i
had
entered
watching
those
deathful
eyes
and
crushing
under
my
feet
the
remnants
of
some
broken
china
with
which
the
carpet
was
bestrewn
i
had
no
thought
of
her
hardly
any
of
myself
to
cross
the
room
was
all
to
escape
as
secretly
as
i
came
before
the
portiere
so
nearly
drawn
between
me
and
the
main
hall
should
stir
under
the
hand
of
some
curious
person
entering
it
was
my
first
sight
of
blood
my
first
contact
with
crime
and
that
was
what
i
did
i
the
last
word
was
uttered
with
a
gasp
evidently
he
was
greatly
affected
by
this
horrible
experience
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
he
muttered
but
nothing
can
now
undo
the
fact
i
slid
from
the
presence
of
this
murdered
woman
as
though
she
had
been
the
victim
of
my
own
rage
or
cupidity
and
being
fortunate
enough
to
reach
the
before
the
alarm
had
spread
beyond
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
alcove
found
and
put
on
the
handkerchief
which
made
it
possible
for
me
to
rush
down
and
find
miss
van
arsdale
who
somebody
told
me
had
fainted
not
till
i
stood
over
her
in
that
remote
corner
beyond
the
did
i
again
think
of
the
gloves
what
i
did
when
i
happened
to
think
of
them
you
already
know
i
could
have
shown
no
greater
cowardice
if
i
had
known
that
the
murdered
woman
s
diamond
was
hidden
inside
them
yet
i
did
not
know
this
or
even
suspect
it
nor
do
i
understand
now
her
reason
for
placing
it
there
why
should
fairbrother
risk
such
an
invaluable
gem
to
the
custody
of
one
she
knew
so
little
an
unconscious
custody
too
was
she
afraid
of
being
murdered
if
she
retained
this
jewel
the
inspector
thought
a
moment
and
then
said
you
mention
your
dread
of
some
one
entering
by
the
one
door
before
you
could
escape
by
the
other
do
you
refer
to
the
friend
you
left
sitting
on
the
divan
opposite
no
my
friend
had
left
that
seat
the
portiere
was
sufficiently
drawn
for
me
to
detect
that
if
i
had
waited
a
minute
longer
he
bitterly
added
i
should
have
found
my
way
open
to
the
regular
entrance
and
so
escaped
all
mr
durand
you
are
not
obliged
to
answer
any
of
my
questions
but
if
you
wish
you
may
tell
me
whether
at
this
moment
of
apprehension
you
thought
of
the
danger
you
ran
of
being
seen
from
outside
by
some
one
of
the
many
coachmen
passing
by
on
the
driveway
no
i
did
not
even
think
of
the
window
i
don
t
know
why
but
if
any
one
passing
by
did
see
me
i
hope
they
saw
enough
to
substantiate
my
the
inspector
made
no
reply
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
i
heard
afterward
that
the
curtains
looped
back
in
the
early
evening
had
been
found
hanging
at
full
length
over
this
window
by
those
who
first
rushed
in
upon
the
scene
of
death
had
he
hoped
to
entrap
durand
into
some
damaging
admission
or
was
he
merely
testing
his
truth
his
expression
afforded
no
clue
to
his
thoughts
and
durand
noting
this
remarked
with
some
dignity
i
do
not
expect
strangers
to
accept
these
explanations
which
must
sound
strange
and
inadequate
in
face
of
the
proof
i
carry
of
having
been
with
that
woman
after
the
fatal
weapon
struck
her
heart
but
to
one
who
knows
me
and
knows
me
well
i
can
surely
appeal
for
credence
to
a
tale
which
i
here
declare
to
be
as
true
as
if
i
had
sworn
to
it
in
a
court
of
anson
i
passionately
cried
out
loosening
my
clutch
upon
my
uncle
s
arm
my
confidence
in
him
had
returned
and
then
as
i
noted
the
inspector
s
businesslike
air
and
my
uncle
s
wavering
look
and
unconvinced
manner
i
felt
my
heart
swell
and
flinging
all
discretion
to
the
wind
i
bounded
eagerly
forward
laying
my
hands
in
those
of
durand
i
cried
fervently
i
believe
in
you
nothing
but
your
own
words
shall
ever
shake
my
confidence
in
your
the
sweet
glad
look
i
received
was
my
best
reply
i
could
leave
the
room
after
that
but
not
the
house
another
experience
awaited
me
awaited
us
all
before
this
full
eventful
evening
came
to
a
close
superstition
i
had
gone
up
stairs
for
my
wraps
my
uncle
having
insisted
on
my
withdrawing
from
a
scene
where
my
very
presence
seemed
in
some
degree
to
compromise
me
soon
prepared
for
my
departure
i
was
crossing
the
hall
to
the
small
door
communicating
with
the
side
staircase
where
my
uncle
had
promised
to
await
me
when
i
felt
myself
seized
by
a
desire
to
have
another
look
below
before
leaving
the
place
in
which
were
centered
all
my
deepest
interests
a
wide
landing
breaking
up
the
main
flight
of
stairs
some
few
feet
from
the
top
offered
me
an
admirable
point
of
view
with
but
little
thought
of
possible
consequences
and
no
thought
at
all
of
my
poor
patient
uncle
i
slipped
down
to
this
landing
and
protected
by
the
unusual
height
of
its
balustrade
allowed
myself
a
parting
glance
at
the
scene
with
which
my
most
poignant
memories
were
henceforth
to
be
connected
before
me
lay
the
large
square
of
the
central
hall
opening
out
from
this
was
the
corridor
leading
to
the
front
door
and
incidentally
to
the
library
as
my
glance
ran
down
this
corridor
i
beheld
approaching
from
the
room
just
mentioned
the
tall
figure
of
the
englishman
he
halted
as
he
reached
the
main
hall
and
stood
gazing
eagerly
at
a
group
of
men
and
women
clustered
near
the
fireplace
a
group
on
which
i
no
sooner
cast
my
own
eye
than
my
attention
also
became
fixed
the
inspector
had
come
from
the
room
where
i
had
left
him
with
durand
and
was
showing
to
these
people
the
extraordinary
diamond
which
he
had
just
recovered
under
such
remarkable
if
not
suspicious
circumstances
young
heads
and
old
were
meeting
over
it
and
i
was
straining
my
ears
to
hear
such
comments
as
were
audible
above
the
general
hubbub
when
grey
made
a
quick
move
and
i
looked
his
way
again
in
time
to
mark
his
air
of
concern
and
the
uncertainty
he
showed
whether
to
advance
or
retreat
unconscious
of
my
watchful
eye
and
noting
no
doubt
that
most
of
the
persons
in
the
group
on
which
his
own
eye
was
leveled
stood
with
their
backs
toward
him
he
made
no
effort
to
disguise
his
profound
interest
in
the
stone
his
eye
followed
its
passage
from
hand
to
hand
with
a
covetous
eagerness
of
which
he
may
not
have
been
aware
and
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
when
after
a
short
interval
of
troubled
indecision
he
impulsively
stepped
forward
and
begged
the
privilege
of
handling
the
gem
himself
our
host
who
stood
not
far
from
the
inspector
said
something
to
that
gentleman
which
led
to
this
request
being
complied
with
the
stone
was
passed
over
to
grey
and
i
saw
possibly
because
my
heart
was
in
my
eyes
that
the
great
man
s
hand
trembled
as
it
touched
his
palm
indeed
his
whole
frame
trembled
and
i
was
looking
eagerly
for
the
result
of
his
inspection
when
on
his
turning
to
hold
the
jewel
up
to
the
light
something
happened
so
abnormal
and
so
strange
that
no
one
who
was
fortunate
or
unfortunate
enough
to
be
present
in
the
house
at
that
instant
will
ever
forget
it
this
something
was
a
cry
coming
from
no
one
knew
where
which
unearthly
in
its
shrillness
and
the
power
it
had
on
the
imagination
reverberated
through
the
house
and
died
away
in
a
wail
so
weird
so
thrilling
and
so
prolonged
that
it
gripped
not
only
my
own
nerveless
and
weakened
heart
but
those
of
the
ten
strong
men
congregated
below
me
the
diamond
dropped
from
grey
s
hand
and
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
moved
to
pick
it
up
not
till
silence
had
come
again
a
silence
almost
as
unendurable
to
the
sensitive
ear
as
the
cry
which
had
preceded
it
did
any
one
stir
or
think
of
the
gem
then
one
gentleman
after
another
bent
to
look
for
it
but
with
no
success
till
one
of
the
waiters
who
possibly
had
followed
it
with
his
eye
or
caught
sight
of
its
sparkle
on
the
edge
of
the
rug
whither
it
had
rolled
sprang
and
picked
it
up
and
handed
it
back
to
grey
instinctively
the
englishman
s
hand
closed
on
it
but
it
was
very
evident
to
me
and
i
think
to
all
that
his
interest
in
it
was
gone
if
he
looked
at
it
he
did
not
see
it
for
he
stood
like
one
stunned
all
the
time
that
agitated
men
and
women
were
running
hither
and
thither
in
unavailing
efforts
to
locate
the
sound
yet
ringing
in
their
ears
not
till
these
various
searchers
had
all
come
together
again
in
terror
of
a
mystery
they
could
not
solve
did
he
let
his
hand
fall
and
himself
awake
to
the
scene
about
him
the
words
he
at
once
gave
utterance
to
were
as
remarkable
as
all
the
rest
gentlemen
said
he
you
must
pardon
my
agitation
this
cry
you
need
not
seek
its
source
is
one
to
which
i
am
only
too
well
accustomed
i
have
been
the
happy
father
of
six
children
five
i
have
buried
and
before
the
death
of
each
this
same
cry
has
echoed
in
my
ears
i
have
but
one
child
left
a
daughter
she
is
ill
at
the
hotel
do
you
wonder
that
i
shrink
from
this
note
of
warning
and
show
myself
something
less
than
a
man
under
its
influence
i
am
going
home
but
first
one
word
about
this
here
he
lifted
it
and
bestowed
or
appeared
to
bestow
on
it
an
anxious
scrutiny
putting
on
his
glasses
and
examining
it
carefully
before
passing
it
back
to
the
inspector
i
have
heard
said
he
with
a
change
of
tone
which
must
have
been
noticeable
to
every
one
that
this
stone
was
a
very
superior
one
and
quite
worthy
of
the
fame
it
bore
here
in
america
but
gentlemen
you
have
all
been
greatly
deceived
in
it
no
one
more
than
he
who
was
willing
to
commit
murder
for
its
possession
the
stone
which
you
have
just
been
good
enough
to
allow
me
to
inspect
is
no
diamond
but
a
carefully
manufactured
bit
of
paste
not
worth
the
rich
and
elaborate
setting
which
has
been
given
to
it
i
am
sorry
to
be
the
one
to
say
this
but
i
have
made
a
study
of
precious
stones
and
i
can
not
let
this
imitation
pass
through
my
hands
without
a
protest
ramsdell
this
to
our
host
i
beg
you
will
allow
me
to
utter
my
excuses
and
depart
at
once
my
daughter
is
worse
this
i
know
as
certainly
as
that
i
am
standing
here
the
cry
you
have
heard
is
the
one
superstition
of
our
family
pray
god
that
i
find
her
alive
after
this
what
could
be
said
though
no
one
who
had
heard
him
not
even
my
own
romantic
self
showed
any
belief
in
this
interpretation
of
the
remarkable
sound
that
had
just
gone
thrilling
through
the
house
yet
in
face
of
his
declared
acceptance
of
it
as
a
warning
and
the
fact
that
all
efforts
had
failed
to
locate
the
sound
or
even
to
determine
its
source
no
other
course
seemed
open
but
to
let
this
distinguished
man
depart
with
the
suddenness
his
superstitious
fears
demanded
that
this
was
in
opposition
to
the
inspector
s
wishes
was
evident
enough
naturally
he
would
have
preferred
grey
to
remain
if
only
to
make
clear
his
surprising
conclusions
in
regard
to
a
diamond
which
had
passed
through
the
hands
of
some
of
the
best
judges
in
the
country
without
a
doubt
having
been
raised
as
to
its
genuineness
with
his
departure
the
inspector
s
manner
changed
he
glanced
at
the
stone
in
his
hand
and
slowly
shook
his
head
i
doubt
if
grey
s
judgment
can
be
depended
on
said
he
and
pocketed
the
gem
as
carefully
as
if
his
belief
in
its
real
value
had
been
but
little
disturbed
by
the
assertions
of
this
renowned
foreigner
i
have
no
distinct
remembrance
of
how
i
finally
left
the
house
or
of
what
passed
between
my
uncle
and
myself
on
our
way
home
i
was
numb
with
the
shock
and
neither
my
intelligence
nor
my
feelings
were
any
longer
active
i
recall
but
one
impression
and
that
was
the
effect
made
on
me
by
my
old
home
on
our
arrival
there
as
of
something
new
and
strange
so
much
had
happened
and
such
changes
had
taken
place
in
myself
since
leaving
it
five
hours
before
but
nothing
else
is
vivid
in
my
remembrance
till
that
early
hour
of
the
dreary
morning
when
on
waking
to
the
world
with
a
cry
i
beheld
my
uncle
s
anxious
figure
bending
over
me
from
the
instantly
i
found
tongue
and
question
after
question
leaped
from
my
lips
he
did
not
answer
them
he
could
not
but
when
i
grew
feverish
and
insistent
he
drew
the
morning
paper
from
behind
his
back
and
laid
it
quietly
down
within
my
reach
i
felt
calmed
in
an
instant
and
when
after
a
few
affectionate
words
he
left
me
to
myself
i
seized
on
the
sheet
and
read
what
so
many
others
were
reading
at
that
moment
throughout
the
city
i
spare
you
the
account
so
far
as
it
coincides
with
what
i
had
myself
seen
and
heard
the
night
before
a
few
particulars
which
had
not
reached
my
ears
will
interest
you
the
instrument
of
death
found
in
the
place
designated
by
durand
was
one
of
note
to
such
as
had
any
taste
or
knowledge
of
curios
it
was
a
stiletto
of
the
most
delicate
type
long
keen
and
slender
not
an
american
product
not
even
of
this
century
s
manufacture
but
a
relic
of
the
days
when
deadly
thrusts
were
given
in
the
corners
and
of
medieval
streets
this
made
the
first
mystery
the
second
was
the
as
yet
unexplainable
presence
on
the
alcove
floor
of
two
broken
which
no
waiter
nor
any
other
person
in
fact
admitted
having
carried
there
the
tray
which
had
fallen
from
peter
mooney
s
hand
the
waiter
who
had
been
the
first
to
give
the
alarm
of
murder
had
held
no
cups
only
ices
this
was
a
fact
proved
but
the
handles
of
two
cups
had
been
found
among
the
debris
cups
which
must
have
been
full
from
the
size
of
the
coffee
stain
left
on
the
rug
where
they
had
fallen
in
reading
this
i
remembered
that
durand
had
mentioned
stepping
on
some
broken
pieces
of
china
in
his
escape
from
the
fatal
scene
and
struck
with
this
confirmation
of
a
theory
which
was
slowly
taking
form
in
my
own
mind
i
passed
on
to
the
next
paragraph
with
a
sense
of
expectation
the
result
was
a
surprise
others
may
have
been
told
i
was
not
that
fairbrother
had
received
a
communication
from
outside
only
a
few
minutes
previous
to
her
death
a
fullerton
who
had
preceded
durand
in
his
visit
to
the
alcove
owned
to
having
opened
the
window
for
her
at
some
call
or
signal
from
outside
and
taken
in
a
small
piece
of
paper
which
he
saw
lifted
up
from
below
on
the
end
of
a
whip
handle
he
could
not
see
who
held
the
whip
but
at
fairbrother
s
entreaty
he
unpinned
the
note
and
gave
it
to
her
while
she
was
puzzling
over
it
for
it
was
apparently
far
from
legible
he
took
another
look
out
in
time
to
mark
a
figure
rush
from
below
toward
the
carriage
drive
he
did
not
recognize
the
figure
nor
would
he
know
it
again
as
to
the
nature
of
the
communication
itself
he
could
say
nothing
save
that
fairbrother
did
not
seem
to
be
affected
favorably
by
it
she
frowned
and
was
looking
very
gloomy
when
he
left
the
alcove
asked
if
he
had
pulled
the
curtains
together
after
closing
the
window
he
said
that
he
had
not
that
she
had
not
requested
him
to
do
so
this
story
which
was
certainly
a
strange
one
had
been
confirmed
by
the
testimony
of
the
coachman
who
had
lent
his
whip
for
the
purpose
this
coachman
who
was
known
to
be
a
man
of
extreme
good
nature
had
seen
no
harm
in
lending
his
whip
to
a
poor
devil
who
wished
to
give
a
telegram
or
some
such
hasty
message
to
the
lady
sitting
just
above
them
in
a
lighted
window
the
wind
was
fierce
and
the
snow
blinding
and
it
was
natural
that
the
man
should
duck
his
head
but
he
remembered
his
appearance
well
enough
to
say
that
he
was
either
very
cold
or
very
much
done
up
and
that
he
wore
a
greatcoat
with
the
collar
pulled
up
about
his
ears
when
he
came
back
with
the
whip
he
seemed
more
cheerful
than
when
he
asked
for
it
but
had
no
thank
you
for
the
favor
done
him
or
if
he
had
it
was
lost
in
his
throat
and
the
piercing
gale
the
communication
which
was
regarded
by
the
police
as
a
matter
of
the
highest
importance
had
been
found
in
her
hand
by
the
coroner
it
was
a
mere
scrawl
written
in
pencil
on
a
small
scrap
of
paper
the
following
facsimile
of
the
scrawl
was
given
to
the
public
in
the
hope
that
some
one
would
recognize
the
handwriting
the
first
two
lines
overlapped
and
were
confused
but
the
last
one
was
clear
enough
expect
trouble
if
if
what
hundreds
were
asking
the
question
and
at
this
very
moment
i
should
soon
be
asking
it
too
but
first
i
must
make
an
effort
to
understand
the
situation
a
situation
which
up
to
now
appeared
to
involve
durand
and
durand
only
as
the
suspected
party
this
was
no
more
than
i
expected
yet
it
came
with
a
shock
under
the
broad
glare
of
this
wintry
morning
so
impossible
did
it
seem
in
the
light
of
life
that
guilt
could
be
associated
in
any
one
s
mind
with
a
man
of
such
unblemished
record
and
excellent
standing
but
the
evidence
adduced
against
him
was
of
a
kind
to
appeal
to
the
common
mind
we
all
know
that
evidence
nor
could
i
say
after
reading
the
full
account
that
i
was
myself
unaffected
by
its
seeming
weight
not
that
my
faith
in
his
innocence
was
shaken
i
had
met
his
look
of
love
and
tender
gratitude
and
my
confidence
in
him
had
been
restored
but
i
saw
with
all
the
clearness
of
a
mind
trained
by
continuous
study
how
difficult
it
was
going
to
be
to
counteract
the
prejudice
induced
first
by
his
own
inconsiderate
acts
especially
by
that
unfortunate
attempt
of
his
to
secrete
fairbrother
s
gloves
in
another
woman
s
bag
and
secondly
by
his
peculiar
explanations
explanations
which
to
many
must
seem
forced
and
unnatural
i
saw
and
felt
nerved
to
a
superhuman
task
i
believed
him
innocent
and
if
others
failed
to
prove
him
so
i
would
undertake
to
clear
him
myself
i
the
little
rita
with
no
experience
of
law
or
courts
or
crime
but
with
simply
an
unbounded
faith
in
the
man
suspected
and
in
the
keenness
of
my
own
insight
an
insight
which
had
already
served
me
so
well
and
would
serve
me
yet
better
once
i
had
mastered
the
details
which
must
be
the
prelude
to
all
intelligent
action
the
morning
s
report
stopped
with
the
explanations
given
by
durand
of
the
appearances
against
him
consequently
no
word
appeared
of
the
after
events
which
had
made
such
an
impression
at
the
time
on
all
the
persons
present
grey
was
mentioned
but
simply
as
one
of
the
guests
and
to
no
one
reading
this
early
morning
issue
would
any
doubt
come
as
to
the
genuineness
of
the
diamond
which
to
all
appearance
had
been
the
leading
motive
in
the
commission
of
this
great
crime
the
effect
on
my
own
mind
of
this
suppression
was
a
curious
one
i
began
to
wonder
if
the
whole
event
had
not
been
a
chimera
of
my
disturbed
brain
a
nightmare
which
had
visited
me
and
me
alone
and
not
a
fact
to
be
reckoned
with
but
a
moment
s
further
thought
served
to
clear
my
mind
of
all
such
doubts
and
i
perceived
that
the
police
had
only
exercised
common
prudence
in
withholding
grey
s
sensational
opinion
of
the
stone
till
it
could
be
verified
by
experts
the
two
columns
of
gossip
devoted
to
the
family
differences
which
had
led
to
the
separation
of
and
fairbrother
i
shall
compress
into
a
few
lines
they
had
been
married
three
years
before
in
the
city
of
baltimore
he
was
a
rich
man
then
but
not
the
multimillionaire
he
is
and
without
manner
lie
was
no
mate
for
this
sparkling
coquette
whose
charm
was
of
the
kind
which
grows
with
exercise
though
no
actual
scandal
was
ever
associated
with
her
name
he
grew
tired
of
her
caprices
and
the
conquests
which
she
made
no
endeavor
to
hide
either
from
him
or
from
the
world
at
large
and
at
some
time
during
the
previous
year
they
had
come
to
a
friendly
understanding
which
led
to
their
living
apart
each
in
grand
style
and
with
a
certain
deference
to
the
proprieties
which
retained
them
their
friends
and
an
enviable
place
in
society
he
was
not
often
invited
where
she
was
and
she
never
appeared
in
any
assemblage
where
he
was
expected
but
with
this
exception
little
feeling
was
shown
matters
progressed
smoothly
and
to
their
credit
let
it
be
said
no
one
ever
heard
either
of
them
speak
otherwise
than
considerately
of
the
other
he
was
at
present
out
or
town
having
started
some
three
weeks
before
for
the
southwest
but
would
probably
return
on
receipt
of
the
telegram
which
had
been
sent
him
the
comments
made
on
the
murder
were
necessarily
hurried
it
was
called
a
mystery
but
it
was
evident
enough
that
durand
s
detention
was
looked
on
as
the
almost
certain
prelude
to
his
arrest
on
the
charge
of
murder
i
had
had
some
discipline
in
life
although
a
favorite
of
my
wealthy
uncle
i
had
given
up
very
early
the
prospects
he
held
out
to
me
of
a
continued
enjoyment
of
his
bounty
and
entered
on
duties
which
required
and
hard
work
i
did
this
because
i
enjoy
having
both
my
mind
and
heart
occupied
to
be
necessary
to
some
one
as
a
nurse
is
to
a
patient
seemed
to
me
an
enviable
fate
till
i
came
under
the
influence
of
anson
durand
then
the
craving
of
all
women
for
the
common
lot
of
their
sex
became
my
craving
also
a
craving
however
to
which
i
failed
at
first
to
yield
for
i
felt
that
it
was
unshared
and
thus
a
token
of
weakness
fighting
my
battle
i
succeeded
in
winning
it
as
i
thought
just
as
the
nurse
s
diploma
was
put
in
my
hands
then
came
the
great
surprise
of
my
life
anson
durand
expressed
his
love
for
me
and
i
awoke
to
the
fact
that
all
my
preparation
had
been
for
home
joys
and
a
woman
s
true
existence
one
hour
of
ecstasy
in
the
light
of
this
new
hope
then
tragedy
and
something
approaching
chaos
truly
i
had
been
through
a
schooling
but
was
it
one
to
make
me
useful
in
the
only
way
i
could
be
useful
now
i
did
not
know
i
did
not
care
i
was
determined
on
my
course
fit
or
unfit
and
in
the
relief
brought
by
this
appeal
to
my
energy
i
rose
and
dressed
and
went
about
the
duties
of
the
day
one
of
these
was
to
determine
whether
grey
on
his
return
to
his
hotel
had
found
his
daughter
as
ill
as
his
fears
had
foreboded
a
telephone
message
or
two
satisfied
me
on
this
point
miss
grey
was
very
ill
but
not
considered
dangerously
so
indeed
if
anything
her
condition
was
improved
and
if
nothing
happened
in
the
way
of
fresh
complications
the
prospects
were
that
she
would
be
out
in
a
fortnight
i
was
not
surprised
it
was
more
than
i
had
expected
the
cry
of
the
banshee
in
an
american
house
was
past
belief
even
in
an
atmosphere
surcharged
with
fear
and
all
the
horror
surrounding
a
great
crime
and
in
the
secret
reckoning
i
was
making
against
a
person
i
will
not
even
name
at
this
juncture
i
added
it
as
another
suspicious
circumstance
vi
suspense
to
relate
the
full
experiences
of
the
next
few
days
would
be
to
encumber
my
narrative
with
unnecessary
detail
i
did
not
see
durand
again
my
uncle
so
amenable
in
most
matters
proved
inexorable
on
this
point
till
durand
s
good
name
should
be
restored
by
the
coroner
s
verdict
or
such
evidence
brought
to
light
as
should
effectually
place
him
beyond
all
suspicion
i
was
to
hold
no
communication
with
him
of
any
sort
whatever
i
remember
the
very
words
with
which
my
uncle
ended
the
one
exhaustive
conversation
we
had
on
the
subject
they
were
these
you
have
fully
expressed
to
durand
your
entire
confidence
in
his
innocence
that
must
suffice
him
for
the
present
if
he
is
the
honest
gentleman
you
think
him
it
as
uncle
seldom
asserted
himself
and
as
he
is
very
much
in
earnest
when
he
does
i
made
no
attempt
to
combat
this
resolution
especially
as
it
met
the
approval
of
my
better
judgment
but
though
my
power
to
convey
sympathy
fell
thus
under
a
yoke
my
thoughts
and
feelings
remained
free
and
these
were
all
consecrated
to
the
man
struggling
under
an
imputation
the
disgrace
and
humiliation
of
which
he
was
but
poorly
prepared
by
his
former
easy
life
of
social
and
business
prosperity
to
meet
for
durand
in
spite
of
the
few
facts
which
came
up
from
time
to
time
in
confirmation
of
his
story
continued
to
be
almost
universally
regarded
as
a
suspect
this
seemed
to
me
very
unjust
what
if
no
other
clue
offered
no
other
clue
i
mean
recognized
as
such
by
police
or
public
was
he
not
to
have
the
benefit
of
whatever
threw
a
doubt
on
his
own
culpability
for
instance
that
splash
of
blood
on
his
which
i
had
seen
and
the
shape
of
which
i
knew
why
did
not
the
fact
that
it
was
a
splash
and
not
a
spatter
and
spatter
it
would
have
been
had
it
spurted
there
instead
of
falling
from
above
as
he
stated
count
for
more
in
the
minds
of
those
whose
business
it
was
to
probe
into
the
very
heart
of
this
crime
to
me
it
told
such
a
tale
of
innocence
that
i
wondered
how
a
man
like
the
inspector
could
pass
over
it
but
later
i
understood
a
single
word
enlightened
me
the
stain
it
was
true
was
in
the
form
of
a
splash
and
not
a
spurt
but
a
splash
would
have
been
the
result
of
a
drop
falling
from
the
reeking
end
of
the
stiletto
whether
it
dislodged
itself
early
or
late
and
what
was
there
to
prove
that
this
drop
had
not
fallen
at
the
instant
the
stiletto
was
being
thrust
into
the
lantern
instead
of
after
the
escape
of
the
criminal
and
the
entrance
of
another
man
but
the
mystery
of
the
broken
for
that
no
explanation
seemed
to
be
forthcoming
and
the
still
unsolved
one
of
the
written
warning
found
in
the
murdered
woman
s
hand
a
warning
which
had
been
deciphered
to
read
be
warned
he
means
to
be
at
the
ball
expect
trouble
if
was
that
to
be
looked
upon
as
directed
against
a
man
who
from
the
nature
of
his
projected
attempt
would
take
no
one
into
his
confidence
then
the
stiletto
a
photographic
reproduction
of
which
was
in
all
the
papers
was
that
the
kind
of
instrument
which
a
plain
new
york
gentleman
would
be
likely
to
use
in
a
crime
of
this
nature
it
was
a
marked
and
unique
article
capable
as
one
would
think
of
being
easily
traced
to
its
owner
had
it
been
claimed
by
ramsdell
had
it
been
recognized
as
one
of
the
many
works
of
art
scattered
about
the
alcove
its
employment
as
a
means
of
death
would
have
gone
only
to
prove
the
possibly
unpremeditated
nature
of
the
crime
and
so
been
valueless
as
the
basis
of
an
argument
in
favor
of
durand
s
innocence
but
ramsdell
had
disclaimed
from
the
first
all
knowledge
of
it
consequently
one
could
but
feel
justified
in
asking
whether
a
man
of
durand
s
judgment
would
choose
such
an
extraordinary
weapon
in
meditating
so
startling
a
crime
which
from
its
nature
and
circumstance
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
whole
civilized
world
another
argument
advanced
by
himself
and
subscribed
to
by
all
his
friends
was
this
that
a
dealer
in
precious
stones
would
be
the
last
man
to
seek
by
any
unlawful
means
to
possess
so
conspicuous
a
jewel
for
he
better
than
any
one
else
would
know
the
impossibility
of
disposing
of
a
gem
of
this
distinction
in
any
market
short
of
the
orient
to
which
the
unanswerable
reply
was
made
that
no
one
attributed
to
him
any
such
folly
that
if
he
had
planned
to
possess
himself
of
this
great
diamond
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
eliminating
it
from
competition
with
the
one
he
had
procured
for
smythe
an
argument
certainly
which
drove
us
back
on
the
only
plea
we
had
at
our
command
his
hitherto
unblemished
reputation
and
the
confidence
which
was
felt
in
him
by
those
who
knew
him
but
the
one
circumstance
which
affected
me
most
at
the
time
and
which
undoubtedly
was
the
source
of
the
greatest
confusion
to
all
minds
whether
official
or
otherwise
was
the
unexpected
confirmation
by
experts
of
grey
s
opinion
in
regard
to
the
diamond
his
name
was
not
used
indeed
it
had
been
kept
out
of
the
papers
with
the
greatest
unanimity
but
the
hint
he
had
given
the
inspector
at
ramsdell
s
ball
had
been
acted
upon
and
the
proper
tests
having
been
made
the
stone
for
which
so
many
believed
a
life
to
have
been
risked
and
another
taken
was
declared
to
be
an
imitation
fine
and
successful
beyond
all
parallel
but
still
an
imitation
of
the
great
and
renowned
gem
which
had
passed
through
tiffany
s
hands
a
before
a
decision
which
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
on
all
such
as
had
seen
the
diamond
blazing
in
unapproachable
brilliancy
on
the
breast
of
the
unhappy
fairbrother
only
an
hour
or
two
before
her
death
on
me
the
effect
was
such
that
for
days
i
lived
in
a
dream
a
condition
that
nevertheless
did
not
prevent
me
from
starting
a
certain
little
inquiry
of
my
own
of
which
more
hereafter
here
let
me
say
that
i
did
not
share
the
general
confusion
on
this
topic
i
had
my
own
theory
both
as
to
the
cause
of
this
substitution
and
the
moment
when
it
was
made
but
the
time
had
not
yet
come
for
me
to
advance
it
i
could
only
stand
back
and
listen
to
the
suppositions
aired
by
the
press
suppositions
which
fomented
so
much
private
discussion
that
ere
long
the
one
question
most
frequently
heard
in
this
connection
was
not
who
struck
the
blow
which
killed
fairbrother
this
was
a
question
which
some
seemed
to
think
settled
but
whose
juggling
hand
had
palmed
off
the
paste
for
the
diamond
and
how
and
when
and
where
had
the
jugglery
taken
place
opinions
on
this
point
were
as
i
have
said
many
and
various
some
fixed
upon
the
moment
of
exchange
as
that
very
critical
and
hardly
appreciable
one
elapsing
between
the
murder
and
durand
s
appearance
upon
the
scene
this
theory
i
need
not
say
was
advanced
by
such
as
believed
that
while
he
was
not
guilty
of
fairbrother
s
murder
lie
had
been
guilty
of
taking
advantage
of
the
same
to
rob
the
body
of
what
in
the
terror
and
excitement
of
the
moment
he
evidently
took
to
be
her
great
gem
to
others
among
whom
were
many
eyewitnesses
of
the
event
it
appeared
to
be
a
conceded
fact
that
this
substitution
had
been
made
prior
to
the
ball
and
with
fairbrother
s
full
cognizance
the
effectual
way
in
which
she
had
wielded
her
fan
between
the
glittering
ornament
on
her
breast
and
the
inquisitive
glances
constantly
leveled
upon
it
might
at
the
time
have
been
due
to
coquetry
but
to
them
it
looked
much
more
like
an
expression
of
fear
lest
the
deception
in
which
she
was
indulging
should
be
discovered
no
one
fixed
the
time
where
i
did
but
then
no
one
but
myself
had
watched
the
scene
with
the
eyes
of
love
besides
and
this
must
be
remembered
most
people
among
whom
i
ventured
to
count
the
police
officials
were
mainly
interested
in
proving
durand
guilty
while
i
with
contrary
mind
was
bent
on
establishing
such
facts
as
confirmed
the
explanations
he
had
been
pleased
to
give
us
explanations
which
necessitated
a
conviction
on
fairbrother
s
part
of
the
great
value
of
the
jewel
she
wore
and
the
consequent
advisability
of
ridding
herself
of
it
temporarily
if
as
so
many
believed
the
full
letter
of
the
warning
should
read
be
warned
he
means
to
be
at
the
ball
expect
trouble
if
you
are
found
wearing
the
great
true
she
may
herself
have
been
deceived
concerning
it
unconsciously
to
herself
she
may
have
been
the
victim
of
a
daring
fraud
on
the
part
of
some
who
had
access
to
her
jewels
but
as
no
such
evidence
had
yet
come
to
life
as
she
had
no
recognized
or
so
far
as
could
be
learned
secret
lover
or
dishonest
dependent
and
moreover
as
no
gem
of
such
unusual
value
was
known
to
have
been
offered
within
the
year
here
or
abroad
in
public
or
private
market
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
credit
this
assumption
possibly
because
i
was
so
ignorant
as
to
credit
another
and
a
different
one
one
which
you
have
already
seen
growing
in
my
mind
and
which
presumptuous
as
it
was
kept
my
courage
from
failing
through
all
those
dreadful
days
of
enforced
waiting
and
suspense
for
i
was
determined
not
to
intrude
my
suggestions
valuable
as
i
considered
them
till
all
hope
was
gone
of
his
being
righted
by
the
judgment
of
those
who
would
not
lightly
endure
the
interference
of
such
an
insignificant
mote
in
the
great
scheme
of
justice
as
myself
the
inquest
which
might
be
trusted
to
bring
out
all
these
doubtful
points
had
been
delayed
in
anticipation
of
fairbrother
s
return
his
testimony
could
not
but
prove
valuable
if
not
in
fixing
the
criminal
at
least
in
settling
the
moot
point
as
to
whether
the
stone
which
the
estranged
wife
had
carried
away
with
her
on
leaving
the
house
had
been
the
genuine
one
returned
to
him
from
tiffany
s
or
the
imitation
now
in
the
hands
of
the
police
he
had
been
located
somewhere
in
the
mountains
of
lower
colorado
but
strange
to
say
it
had
been
found
impossible
to
enter
into
direct
communication
with
him
nor
was
it
known
whether
he
was
aware
as
yet
of
his
wife
s
tragic
death
so
affairs
went
slowly
in
new
york
and
the
case
seemed
to
come
to
a
standstill
when
public
opinion
was
suddenly
reawakened
and
a
more
definite
turn
given
to
the
whole
matter
by
a
despatch
from
santa
fe
to
the
associated
press
this
despatch
was
to
the
effect
that
abner
fairbrother
had
passed
through
that
city
some
three
days
before
on
his
way
to
his
new
mining
camp
the
placide
that
he
then
showed
symptoms
of
pneumonia
and
from
advices
since
received
might
be
regarded
as
a
very
sick
man
ill
well
that
explained
matters
his
silence
which
many
had
taken
for
indifference
was
that
of
a
man
physically
disabled
and
unfit
for
exertion
of
any
kind
ill
a
tragic
circumstance
which
roused
endless
conjecture
was
he
aware
or
was
he
not
aware
of
his
wife
s
death
had
he
been
taken
ill
before
or
after
he
left
colorado
for
new
mexico
was
he
suffering
mainly
from
shock
or
as
would
appear
from
his
complaint
from
a
too
rapid
change
of
climate
the
whole
country
seethed
with
excitement
and
my
poor
little
insignificant
self
burned
with
impatience
which
only
those
who
have
been
subjected
to
a
like
suspense
can
properly
estimate
would
the
proceedings
which
were
awaited
with
so
much
anxiety
be
further
delayed
would
durand
remain
indefinitely
in
durance
and
under
such
a
cloud
of
disgrace
as
would
kill
some
men
and
might
kill
him
should
i
be
called
upon
to
endure
still
longer
the
suffering
which
this
entailed
upon
me
when
i
thought
i
knew
but
fortune
was
less
obdurate
than
i
feared
next
morning
a
telegraphic
statement
from
santa
fe
settled
one
of
the
points
of
this
great
dispute
a
statement
which
you
will
find
detailed
at
more
length
in
the
following
communication
which
appeared
a
few
days
later
in
one
of
our
most
enterprising
journals
it
was
from
a
resident
correspondent
in
new
mexico
and
was
written
as
the
editor
was
careful
to
say
for
his
own
eyes
and
not
for
the
public
he
had
ventured
however
to
give
it
in
full
knowing
the
great
interest
which
this
whole
subject
had
for
his
readers
vii
night
and
a
voice
not
to
be
outdone
by
the
editor
i
insert
the
article
here
with
all
its
details
the
importance
of
which
i
trust
i
have
anticipated
santa
fe
april
arrived
in
santa
fe
i
inquired
where
abner
fairbrother
could
be
found
i
was
told
that
he
was
at
his
mine
sick
upon
inquiring
as
to
the
location
of
the
placide
i
was
informed
that
it
was
fifteen
miles
or
so
distant
in
the
mountains
and
upon
my
expressing
an
intention
of
going
there
immediately
i
was
given
what
i
thought
very
unnecessary
advice
and
then
directed
to
a
certain
livery
stable
where
i
was
told
i
could
get
the
right
kind
of
a
horse
and
such
equipment
as
i
stood
in
need
of
i
thought
i
was
equipped
all
right
as
it
was
but
i
said
nothing
and
went
on
to
the
livery
stable
here
i
was
shown
a
horse
which
i
took
to
at
once
and
was
about
to
mount
when
a
pair
of
leggings
was
brought
to
me
you
will
need
these
for
your
journey
said
the
man
journey
i
repeated
fifteen
miles
the
livery
stable
keeper
a
with
a
peculiarly
pleasant
smile
cocked
up
his
shoulders
with
the
remark
three
men
as
willing
but
as
inexperienced
as
yourself
have
attempted
the
same
journey
during
the
last
week
and
they
all
came
back
before
they
reached
the
divide
you
will
probably
come
back
too
but
i
shall
give
you
as
fair
a
start
as
if
i
knew
you
were
going
straight
but
a
woman
has
done
it
said
i
a
nurse
from
the
hospital
went
up
that
very
road
last
oh
women
they
can
do
anything
women
who
are
nurses
but
they
don
t
start
off
alone
you
are
going
yes
i
remarked
grimly
newspaper
correspondents
make
their
journeys
singly
when
they
oh
you
are
a
newspaper
correspondent
why
do
so
many
men
from
the
papers
want
to
see
that
sick
old
man
because
he
s
so
rich
don
t
you
know
i
asked
he
did
not
seem
to
i
wondered
at
his
ignorance
but
did
not
enlighten
him
follow
the
trail
and
ask
your
way
from
time
to
time
all
the
goatherds
know
where
the
placide
mine
such
were
his
simple
instructions
as
he
headed
my
horse
toward
the
canyon
but
as
i
drew
off
he
shouted
out
if
you
get
stuck
leave
it
to
the
horse
he
knows
more
about
it
than
you
with
a
vague
gesture
toward
the
northwest
he
turned
away
leaving
me
in
contemplation
of
the
grandest
scenery
i
had
yet
come
upon
in
all
my
travels
fifteen
miles
but
those
miles
lay
through
the
very
heart
of
the
mountains
ranging
anywhere
from
six
to
seven
thousand
feet
high
in
ten
minutes
the
city
and
all
signs
of
city
life
were
out
of
sight
in
five
more
i
was
seemingly
as
far
removed
from
all
civilization
as
if
i
had
gone
a
hundred
miles
into
the
wilderness
as
my
horse
settled
down
to
work
picking
his
way
now
here
and
now
there
sometimes
over
the
brown
earth
hard
and
baked
as
in
a
thousand
furnaces
and
sometimes
over
the
stunted
grass
whose
stalks
seemed
never
to
have
known
moisture
i
let
my
eyes
roam
to
such
peaks
as
were
not
cut
off
from
view
by
the
nearer
hillsides
and
wondered
whether
the
snow
which
capped
them
was
whiter
than
any
other
or
the
blue
of
the
sky
bluer
that
the
two
together
had
the
effect
upon
me
of
cameo
work
on
a
huge
and
unapproachable
scale
certainly
the
effect
of
these
grand
mountains
into
which
you
leap
without
any
preparation
from
the
streets
and
of
america
s
oldest
city
is
such
as
is
not
easily
described
we
struck
water
now
and
then
narrow
water
courses
which
my
horse
followed
in
mid
stream
and
more
interesting
yet
goatherds
with
their
flocks
mexicans
all
who
seemed
to
understand
no
english
but
were
picturesque
enough
to
look
at
and
a
welcome
break
in
the
extreme
lonesomeness
of
the
way
i
had
been
told
that
they
would
serve
me
as
guides
if
i
felt
at
all
doubtful
of
the
trail
and
in
one
or
two
instances
they
proved
to
be
of
decided
help
they
could
gesticulate
if
they
could
not
speak
english
and
when
i
tried
them
with
the
one
word
placide
they
would
nod
and
point
out
which
of
the
many
side
canyons
i
was
to
follow
but
they
always
looked
up
as
they
did
so
up
up
till
i
took
to
looking
up
too
and
when
after
miles
multiplied
indefinitely
by
the
winding
of
the
trail
i
came
out
upon
a
ledge
from
which
a
full
view
of
the
opposite
range
could
be
had
and
saw
fronting
me
from
the
side
of
one
of
its
tremendous
peaks
the
gap
of
a
vast
hole
not
two
hundred
feet
from
the
snowline
i
knew
that
inaccessible
as
it
looked
i
was
gazing
up
at
the
opening
of
abner
fairbrother
s
new
mine
the
placide
the
experience
was
a
strange
one
the
two
ranges
approached
so
nearly
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
ball
might
be
tossed
from
one
to
the
other
but
the
chasm
between
was
stupendous
i
grew
dizzy
as
i
looked
downward
and
saw
the
endless
zigzags
yet
to
be
traversed
step
by
step
before
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
could
be
reached
and
then
the
equally
interminable
zigzags
up
the
acclivity
beyond
all
of
which
i
must
trace
still
step
by
step
before
i
could
hope
to
arrive
at
the
camp
which
from
where
i
stood
looked
to
be
almost
within
hail
of
my
voice
i
have
described
the
mine
as
a
hole
that
was
all
i
saw
at
first
a
great
black
hole
in
the
dark
brown
earth
of
the
from
which
ran
down
a
still
darker
streak
into
the
waste
places
far
below
it
but
as
i
looked
longer
i
saw
that
it
was
faced
by
a
ledge
cut
out
of
the
friable
soil
on
which
i
was
now
able
to
descry
the
pronounced
white
of
two
or
three
and
some
other
signs
of
life
encouraging
enough
to
the
eye
of
one
whose
lot
it
was
to
crawl
like
a
fly
up
that
tremendous
truly
i
could
understand
why
those
three
men
probably
newspaper
correspondents
like
myself
had
turned
back
to
santa
fe
after
a
glance
from
my
present
outlook
but
though
i
understood
i
did
not
mean
to
duplicate
their
retreat
the
sight
of
those
tents
the
thought
of
what
one
of
them
contained
inspired
me
with
new
courage
and
releasing
my
grip
upon
the
rein
i
allowed
my
patient
horse
to
proceed
shortly
after
this
i
passed
the
divide
that
is
where
the
water
sheds
both
ways
then
the
descent
began
it
was
zigzag
just
as
the
climb
had
been
but
i
preferred
the
climb
i
did
not
have
the
unfathomable
spaces
so
constantly
before
me
nor
was
my
imagination
so
active
it
was
fixed
on
heights
to
be
attained
rather
than
on
valleys
to
roll
into
however
i
did
not
roll
the
mexican
saddle
held
me
securely
at
whatever
angle
i
was
poised
and
once
the
bottom
was
reached
i
found
that
i
could
face
with
considerable
equanimity
the
corresponding
ascent
only
as
i
saw
how
steep
the
climb
bade
fair
to
be
i
did
not
see
how
i
was
ever
to
come
down
again
going
up
was
possible
but
the
descent
however
as
what
goes
up
must
in
the
course
of
nature
come
down
i
put
this
question
aside
and
gave
my
horse
his
head
after
encouraging
him
with
a
few
blades
of
grass
which
he
seemed
to
find
edible
enough
though
they
had
the
look
and
something
of
the
feel
of
spun
glass
how
we
got
there
you
must
ask
this
good
animal
who
took
all
the
responsibility
and
did
all
the
work
i
merely
clung
and
balanced
and
at
times
when
he
rounded
the
end
of
a
zigzag
for
instance
i
even
shut
my
eyes
though
the
prospect
was
magnificent
at
last
even
his
patience
seemed
to
give
out
and
he
stopped
and
trembled
but
before
i
could
open
my
eyes
on
the
abyss
beneath
he
made
another
effort
i
felt
the
brush
of
tree
branches
across
my
face
and
looking
up
saw
before
me
the
ledge
or
platform
dotted
with
tents
at
which
i
had
looked
with
such
longing
from
the
opposite
hillsides
simultaneously
i
heard
voices
and
saw
approaching
a
bronzed
and
bearded
man
with
scotch
features
and
a
determined
air
the
doctor
i
involuntarily
exclaimed
with
a
glance
at
the
small
and
curious
tent
before
which
he
stood
guard
yes
the
doctor
he
answered
in
unexpectedly
good
english
and
who
are
you
have
you
brought
the
mail
and
those
medicines
i
sent
for
no
i
replied
with
as
propitiatory
a
smile
as
i
could
muster
up
in
face
of
his
brusk
forbidding
expression
i
came
on
my
own
errand
i
am
a
representative
of
the
new
york
and
i
hope
you
will
not
deny
me
a
word
with
with
a
gesture
i
hardly
knew
how
to
interpret
he
took
my
horse
by
the
rein
and
led
us
on
a
few
steps
toward
another
large
tent
where
he
motioned
me
to
descend
then
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
forcing
me
to
meet
his
eye
said
you
have
made
this
journey
i
believe
you
said
from
new
york
to
see
fairbrother
why
because
fairbrother
is
at
present
the
most
man
in
america
i
returned
boldly
his
wife
you
know
about
his
wife
no
how
should
i
know
about
his
wife
i
know
what
his
temperature
is
and
what
his
respiration
is
but
his
wife
what
about
his
wife
he
don
t
know
anything
about
her
now
himself
he
is
not
allowed
to
read
but
you
read
the
papers
you
must
have
known
before
you
left
santa
fe
of
fairbrother
s
foul
and
most
mysterious
murder
in
new
york
it
has
been
the
theme
of
two
continents
for
the
last
ten
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
which
might
mean
anything
and
confined
his
reply
to
a
repetition
of
my
own
words
mrs
fairbrother
murdered
he
exclaimed
but
in
a
suppressed
voice
to
which
point
was
given
by
the
cautious
look
he
cast
behind
him
at
the
tent
which
had
drawn
my
attention
he
must
not
know
it
man
i
could
not
answer
for
his
life
if
he
received
the
least
shock
in
his
present
critical
condition
murdered
when
ten
days
ago
at
a
ball
in
new
york
it
was
after
fairbrother
left
the
city
he
was
expected
to
return
after
hearing
the
news
but
he
seems
to
have
kept
straight
on
to
his
destination
he
was
not
very
fond
of
his
wife
that
is
they
have
not
been
living
together
for
the
last
year
but
he
could
not
help
feeling
the
shock
of
her
death
which
he
must
have
heard
of
somewhere
along
the
he
has
said
nothing
in
his
delirium
to
show
that
he
knew
it
it
is
possible
just
possible
that
he
didn
t
read
the
papers
he
could
not
have
been
well
for
days
before
he
reached
santa
when
were
you
called
in
to
attend
him
the
very
night
after
he
reached
this
place
it
was
thought
he
wouldn
t
live
to
reach
the
camp
but
he
is
a
man
of
great
pluck
he
held
up
till
his
foot
touched
this
platform
then
he
if
he
was
as
sick
as
that
i
muttered
why
did
he
leave
santa
fe
he
must
have
known
what
it
would
mean
to
be
sick
i
don
t
think
he
did
this
is
his
first
visit
to
the
mine
he
evidently
knew
nothing
of
the
difficulties
of
the
road
but
he
would
not
stop
he
was
determined
to
reach
the
camp
even
after
he
had
been
given
a
sight
of
it
from
the
opposite
mountain
he
told
them
that
he
had
once
crossed
the
sierras
in
midwinter
but
he
wasn
t
a
sick
man
doctor
they
don
t
know
who
killed
his
he
didn
i
know
but
under
such
circumstances
every
fact
bearing
on
the
event
is
of
immense
importance
there
is
one
which
fairbrother
only
can
make
clear
it
can
be
said
in
a
word
the
grim
doctor
s
eye
flashed
angrily
and
i
stopped
were
you
a
detective
from
the
district
attorney
s
office
in
new
york
sent
on
with
special
powers
to
examine
him
i
should
still
say
what
i
am
going
to
say
now
while
fairbrother
s
temperature
and
pulse
remain
where
they
now
are
no
one
shall
see
him
and
no
one
shall
talk
to
him
save
myself
and
his
i
turned
with
a
sick
look
of
disappointment
toward
the
road
up
which
i
had
so
lately
come
have
i
panted
sweltered
trembled
for
three
mortal
hours
on
the
worst
trail
a
man
ever
traversed
to
go
back
with
nothing
for
my
journey
that
seems
to
me
hard
lines
where
is
the
manager
of
this
mine
the
doctor
pointed
toward
a
man
bending
over
the
edge
of
the
great
hole
from
which
at
that
moment
a
line
of
mexicans
was
issuing
each
with
a
sack
on
his
back
which
he
flung
down
before
what
looked
like
a
furnace
built
of
clay
that
s
he
haines
of
philadelphia
what
do
you
want
of
him
permission
to
stay
the
night
fairbrother
may
be
better
i
won
t
allow
it
and
i
am
master
here
so
far
as
my
patient
is
concerned
you
couldn
t
stay
here
without
talking
and
talking
makes
excitement
and
excitement
is
just
what
he
can
not
stand
a
week
from
now
i
will
see
about
it
that
is
if
my
patient
continues
to
improve
i
am
not
sure
that
he
let
me
spend
that
week
here
i
ll
not
talk
any
more
than
the
dead
maybe
the
manager
will
let
me
carry
look
here
said
the
doctor
edging
me
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
tent
he
hardly
let
out
of
his
sight
for
a
moment
you
re
a
canny
lad
and
shall
have
your
bite
and
something
to
drink
before
you
take
your
way
back
but
back
you
go
before
sunset
and
with
this
message
no
man
from
any
paper
north
or
south
will
be
received
here
till
i
hang
out
a
blue
flag
i
say
blue
for
that
is
the
color
of
my
bandana
when
my
patient
is
in
a
condition
to
discuss
murder
i
ll
hoist
it
from
his
it
can
be
seen
from
the
divide
and
if
you
want
to
camp
there
on
the
lookout
well
and
good
as
for
the
police
that
s
another
matter
i
will
see
them
if
they
come
but
they
need
not
expect
to
talk
to
my
patient
you
may
say
so
down
there
it
will
save
scrambling
up
this
trail
to
no
you
may
count
on
me
said
i
trust
a
new
york
correspondent
to
do
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
to
head
off
the
boys
but
i
doubt
if
they
will
believe
in
that
case
i
shall
have
a
barricade
thrown
up
fifty
feet
down
the
said
he
but
the
mail
and
your
supplies
oh
the
burros
can
make
their
way
up
we
shan
t
you
are
certainly
master
i
remarked
all
this
time
i
had
been
using
my
eyes
there
was
not
much
to
see
but
what
there
was
was
romantically
interesting
aside
from
the
furnace
and
what
was
going
on
there
there
was
little
else
but
a
a
and
the
small
one
i
had
come
on
first
which
without
the
least
doubt
contained
the
sick
man
this
last
tent
was
of
a
peculiar
construction
and
showed
the
primitive
nature
of
everything
at
this
height
it
consisted
simply
of
a
cloth
thrown
over
a
thing
like
a
trapeze
this
cloth
did
not
even
come
to
the
ground
on
either
side
but
stopped
short
a
foot
or
so
from
the
flat
mound
of
adobe
which
serves
as
a
base
or
floor
for
hut
or
tent
in
new
mexico
the
rear
of
the
simple
tent
abutted
on
the
the
opening
was
toward
the
valley
i
felt
an
intense
desire
to
look
into
this
opening
so
intense
that
i
thought
i
would
venture
on
an
attempt
to
gratify
it
scrutinizing
the
resolute
face
of
the
man
before
me
and
flattering
myself
that
i
detected
signs
of
humor
underlying
his
professional
bruskness
i
asked
somewhat
mournfully
if
he
would
let
me
go
away
without
so
much
as
a
glance
at
the
man
i
had
come
so
far
to
see
a
glimpse
would
satisfy
me
i
assured
him
as
the
hint
of
a
twinkle
flashed
in
his
eye
surely
there
will
be
no
harm
in
that
i
ll
take
it
instead
of
he
smiled
but
not
encouragingly
and
i
was
feeling
very
despondent
indeed
when
the
canvas
on
which
our
eyes
were
fixed
suddenly
shook
and
the
calm
figure
of
a
woman
stepped
out
before
us
clad
in
the
simplest
garb
but
showing
in
every
line
of
face
and
form
a
character
of
mingled
kindness
and
shrewdness
she
was
evidently
on
the
lookout
for
the
doctor
for
she
made
a
sign
as
she
saw
him
and
returned
instantly
into
the
tent
mr
fairbrother
has
just
fallen
asleep
he
explained
it
isn
t
discipline
and
i
shall
have
to
apologize
to
miss
serra
but
if
you
will
promise
not
to
speak
nor
make
the
least
disturbance
i
will
let
you
take
the
one
peep
you
prefer
to
i
promise
said
i
leading
the
way
to
the
opening
he
whispered
a
word
to
the
nurse
then
motioned
me
to
look
in
the
sight
was
a
simple
one
but
to
me
very
impressive
the
owner
of
palaces
a
man
to
whom
millions
were
as
thousands
to
such
poor
devils
as
myself
lay
on
an
improvised
bed
of
evergreens
wrapped
in
a
horse
blanket
and
with
nothing
better
than
another
of
these
rolled
up
under
his
head
at
his
side
sat
his
nurse
on
what
looked
like
the
uneven
stump
of
a
tree
close
to
her
hand
was
a
tolerably
flat
stone
on
which
i
saw
arranged
a
number
of
bottles
and
such
other
comforts
as
were
absolutely
necessary
to
a
proper
care
of
the
sufferer
that
was
all
in
these
few
words
i
have
told
the
whole
story
to
be
sure
this
simple
tent
perched
seven
thousand
feet
and
more
above
had
one
advantage
which
even
his
great
house
in
new
york
could
not
offer
this
was
the
out
look
lying
as
he
did
facing
the
valley
he
had
only
to
open
his
eyes
to
catch
a
full
view
of
the
panorama
of
sky
and
mountain
stretched
out
before
him
it
was
glorious
whether
seen
at
morning
noon
or
night
glorious
but
i
doubt
if
he
would
not
gladly
have
exchanged
it
for
a
sight
of
his
home
walls
as
i
started
to
go
a
stir
took
place
in
the
blanket
wrapped
about
his
chin
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
head
and
hollow
cheeks
of
the
great
financier
he
was
a
very
sick
man
even
i
could
see
that
had
i
obtained
the
permission
i
sought
and
been
allowed
to
ask
him
one
of
the
many
questions
burning
on
my
tongue
i
should
have
received
only
delirium
for
reply
there
was
no
reaching
that
clouded
intelligence
now
and
i
felt
grateful
to
the
doctor
for
convincing
me
of
it
i
told
him
so
and
thanked
him
quite
warmly
when
we
were
well
away
from
the
tent
and
his
answer
was
almost
kindly
though
he
made
no
effort
to
hide
his
impatience
and
anxiety
to
see
me
go
the
looks
he
cast
at
the
sun
were
significant
and
having
no
wish
to
antagonize
him
and
every
wish
to
visit
the
spot
again
i
moved
toward
my
horse
with
the
intention
of
untying
him
to
my
surprise
the
doctor
held
me
back
you
can
t
go
said
he
your
horse
has
hurt
it
was
true
there
was
something
the
matter
with
the
animal
s
left
forefoot
as
the
doctor
lifted
it
the
manager
came
up
he
agreed
with
the
doctor
i
could
not
make
the
descent
to
santa
fe
on
that
horse
that
night
did
i
feel
elated
rather
i
had
no
wish
to
descend
yet
i
was
far
from
foreseeing
what
the
night
was
to
bring
me
i
was
turned
over
to
the
manager
but
not
without
a
final
injunction
from
the
doctor
not
a
word
to
any
one
about
your
errand
not
a
word
about
the
new
york
tragedy
as
you
value
fairbrother
s
not
a
word
said
i
then
he
left
me
to
see
the
sun
go
down
and
the
moon
come
up
from
a
ledge
hung
as
it
were
in
mid
air
the
experience
was
novel
but
i
refrain
i
have
more
important
matters
to
relate
i
was
given
a
bunk
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
long
and
turned
in
with
the
rest
i
expected
to
sleep
but
on
finding
that
i
could
catch
a
sight
of
the
sick
tent
from
under
the
canvas
i
experienced
such
fascination
in
watching
this
forbidden
spot
that
midnight
came
before
i
had
closed
my
eyes
then
all
desire
to
sleep
left
me
for
the
patient
began
to
moan
and
presently
to
talk
and
the
stillness
of
the
solitary
height
being
something
abnormal
i
could
sometimes
catch
the
very
words
devoid
as
they
were
of
all
rational
meaning
they
excited
my
curiosity
to
the
burning
point
for
who
could
tell
if
he
might
not
say
something
bearing
on
the
mystery
but
that
fevered
mind
had
recurred
to
early
scenes
and
the
babble
which
came
to
my
ears
was
all
of
mining
camps
in
the
rockies
and
the
dicker
of
horses
perhaps
the
uneasy
movement
of
my
horse
pulling
at
the
end
of
his
tether
had
disturbed
him
perhaps
but
at
the
inner
utterance
of
the
second
perhaps
i
found
myself
up
on
my
elbow
listening
with
all
my
ears
and
staring
with
eyes
at
the
thicket
of
stunted
trees
where
the
road
debouched
on
the
platform
something
was
astir
there
besides
my
horse
i
could
catch
sounds
of
an
unmistakable
nature
a
rider
was
coming
up
the
trail
slipping
back
into
my
place
i
turned
toward
the
doctor
who
lay
some
two
or
three
bunks
nearer
the
opening
he
had
started
up
too
and
in
a
moment
was
out
of
the
tent
i
do
not
think
he
had
observed
my
action
for
it
was
very
dark
where
i
lay
and
his
back
had
been
turned
toward
me
as
for
the
others
they
slept
like
the
dead
only
they
made
more
noise
interested
everything
is
interesting
at
such
a
height
i
brought
my
eye
to
bear
on
the
ledge
and
soon
saw
by
the
limpid
light
of
a
full
moon
the
stiff
short
branches
of
the
trees
on
which
my
gaze
was
fixed
give
way
to
an
advancing
horse
and
rider
halloo
saluted
the
doctor
in
a
whisper
which
was
in
itself
a
warning
easy
there
we
have
sickness
in
this
camp
and
it
s
a
late
hour
for
i
know
the
answer
was
subdued
but
earnest
i
m
the
magistrate
of
this
district
i
ve
a
question
to
ask
this
sick
man
on
behalf
of
the
new
york
chief
of
police
who
is
a
personal
friend
of
mine
it
is
connected
with
hush
the
doctor
had
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
turned
his
face
away
from
the
sick
tent
then
the
two
heads
came
together
and
an
argument
began
i
could
not
hear
a
word
of
it
but
their
motions
were
eloquent
my
sympathy
was
with
the
magistrate
of
course
and
i
watched
eagerly
while
he
passed
a
letter
over
to
the
doctor
who
vainly
strove
to
read
it
by
the
light
of
the
moon
finding
this
impossible
he
was
about
to
return
it
when
the
other
struck
a
match
and
lit
a
lantern
hanging
from
the
horn
of
his
saddle
the
two
heads
came
together
again
but
as
quickly
separated
with
every
appearance
of
irreconcilement
and
i
was
settling
back
with
sensations
of
great
disappointment
when
a
sound
fell
on
the
night
so
unexpected
to
all
concerned
that
with
a
common
impulse
each
eye
sought
the
sick
tent
water
will
some
one
give
me
water
a
voice
had
cried
quietly
and
with
none
of
the
delirium
which
had
hitherto
rendered
it
unnatural
the
doctor
started
for
the
tent
there
was
the
quickness
of
surprise
in
his
movement
and
the
gesture
he
made
to
the
magistrate
as
he
passed
in
reawakened
an
expectation
in
my
breast
which
made
me
doubly
watchful
providence
was
intervening
in
our
favor
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
see
him
presently
reissue
with
the
nurse
whom
he
drew
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
where
they
had
a
short
conference
if
she
returned
alone
into
the
tent
after
this
conference
i
should
know
that
the
matter
was
at
an
end
and
that
the
doctor
had
decided
to
maintain
his
authority
against
that
of
the
magistrate
but
she
remained
outside
and
the
magistrate
was
invited
to
join
their
council
when
they
again
left
the
shadow
of
the
trees
it
was
to
approach
the
tent
the
magistrate
who
was
in
the
rear
could
not
have
more
than
passed
the
opening
but
i
thought
him
far
enough
inside
not
to
detect
any
movement
on
my
part
so
i
took
advantage
of
the
situation
to
worm
myself
out
of
my
corner
and
across
the
ledge
to
where
the
tent
made
a
shadow
in
the
moonlight
crouching
close
and
laying
my
ear
against
the
canvas
i
listened
the
nurse
was
speaking
in
a
gently
persuasive
tone
i
imagined
her
kneeling
by
the
head
of
the
patient
and
breathing
words
into
his
ear
these
were
what
i
heard
you
love
diamonds
i
have
often
noticed
that
you
look
so
long
at
the
ring
on
your
hand
that
is
why
i
have
let
it
stay
there
though
at
times
i
have
feared
it
would
drop
off
and
roll
away
over
the
adobe
down
the
was
i
right
yes
the
words
came
with
difficulty
but
they
were
clear
enough
it
s
of
small
value
i
like
it
because
he
appeared
to
be
too
weak
to
finish
a
pause
during
which
she
seemed
to
edge
nearer
to
him
we
all
have
some
pet
keepsake
said
she
but
i
should
never
have
supposed
this
stone
of
yours
an
inexpensive
one
but
i
forget
that
you
are
the
owner
of
a
very
large
and
remarkable
diamond
a
diamond
that
is
spoken
of
sometimes
in
the
papers
of
course
if
you
have
a
gem
like
that
this
one
must
appear
very
small
and
valueless
to
yes
this
is
nothing
and
he
appeared
to
turn
away
his
head
mr
fairbrother
pardon
me
but
i
want
to
tell
you
something
about
that
big
diamond
of
yours
you
have
been
in
and
have
not
been
able
to
read
your
letters
so
do
not
know
that
your
wife
has
had
some
trouble
with
that
diamond
people
have
said
that
it
is
not
a
real
stone
but
a
imitation
may
i
write
to
her
that
this
is
a
mistake
that
it
is
all
you
have
ever
claimed
for
it
that
is
an
unusually
large
diamond
of
the
first
water
i
listened
in
amazement
surely
this
was
an
insidious
way
to
get
at
the
truth
a
woman
s
way
but
who
would
say
it
was
not
a
wise
one
the
wisest
perhaps
which
could
be
taken
under
the
circumstances
what
would
his
reply
be
would
it
show
that
he
was
as
ignorant
of
his
wife
s
death
as
was
generally
believed
both
by
those
about
him
here
and
those
who
knew
him
well
in
new
york
or
would
the
question
convey
nothing
further
to
him
than
the
doubt
in
itself
an
insult
of
the
genuineness
of
that
great
stone
which
had
been
his
pride
a
murmur
that
was
all
it
could
be
called
broke
from
his
lips
and
died
away
in
an
inarticulate
gasp
then
suddenly
sharply
a
cry
broke
from
him
an
intelligible
cry
and
we
heard
him
say
no
imitation
no
imitation
it
was
a
sun
a
glory
no
other
like
it
it
lit
the
air
it
blazed
it
burned
i
see
it
now
i
see
there
the
passion
succumbed
the
strength
failed
another
murmur
another
and
the
great
void
of
night
which
stretched
over
i
might
almost
say
under
us
was
no
more
quiet
or
seemingly
impenetrable
than
the
silence
of
that
tent
would
he
speak
again
i
did
not
think
so
would
she
even
try
to
make
him
i
did
not
think
this
either
but
i
did
not
know
the
woman
softly
her
voice
rose
again
there
was
a
dominating
insistence
in
her
tones
gentle
as
they
were
the
insistence
of
a
healthy
mind
which
seeks
to
control
a
weakened
one
you
do
not
know
of
any
imitation
then
it
was
the
real
stone
you
gave
her
you
are
sure
of
it
you
would
be
ready
to
swear
to
it
if
say
just
yes
or
no
she
finished
in
gentle
urgency
evidently
he
was
sinking
again
into
unconsciousness
and
she
was
just
holding
him
back
long
enough
for
the
necessary
word
it
came
slowly
and
with
a
dragging
intonation
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
ring
of
truth
with
which
he
spoke
yes
said
he
when
i
heard
the
doctor
s
voice
and
felt
a
movement
in
the
canvas
against
which
i
leaned
i
took
the
warning
and
stole
back
hurriedly
to
my
quarters
i
was
scarcely
settled
when
the
same
group
of
three
i
had
before
watched
silhouetted
itself
again
against
the
moonlight
there
was
some
talk
a
mingling
and
separating
of
shadows
then
the
nurse
glided
back
to
her
duties
and
the
two
men
went
toward
the
clump
of
trees
where
the
horse
had
been
tethered
ten
minutes
and
the
doctor
was
back
in
his
bunk
was
it
imagination
or
did
i
feel
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
before
he
finally
lay
down
and
composed
himself
to
sleep
i
can
not
say
i
only
know
that
i
gave
no
sign
and
that
soon
all
stir
ceased
in
his
direction
and
i
was
left
to
enjoy
my
triumph
and
to
listen
with
anxious
interest
to
the
strange
and
unintelligible
sounds
which
accompanied
the
descent
of
the
horseman
down
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
finally
to
watch
with
a
fascination
which
drew
me
to
my
knees
the
passage
of
that
sparkling
star
of
light
hanging
from
his
saddle
it
crept
to
and
fro
across
the
side
of
the
opposite
mountain
as
he
threaded
its
endless
zigzags
and
finally
disappeared
over
the
brow
into
the
invisible
canyons
beyond
with
the
disappearance
of
this
beacon
came
lassitude
and
sleep
through
whose
hazy
atmosphere
floated
wild
sentences
from
the
sick
tent
which
showed
that
the
patient
was
back
again
in
nevada
quarreling
over
the
price
of
a
horse
which
was
to
carry
him
beyond
the
reach
of
some
threatening
avalanche
when
next
morning
i
came
to
depart
the
doctor
took
me
by
both
hands
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
eyes
you
heard
he
said
how
do
you
know
i
asked
i
can
tell
a
satisfied
man
when
i
see
him
he
growled
throwing
down
my
hands
with
that
same
humorous
twinkle
in
his
eyes
which
had
encouraged
me
from
the
first
i
made
no
answer
but
i
shall
remember
the
lesson
one
detail
more
when
i
stared
on
my
own
descent
i
found
why
the
leggings
with
which
i
had
been
provided
were
so
indispensable
i
was
not
allowed
to
ride
indeed
riding
down
those
steep
declivities
was
impossible
no
horse
could
preserve
his
balance
with
a
rider
on
his
back
i
slid
so
did
my
horse
and
only
in
the
valley
beneath
did
we
come
together
again
viii
arrest
the
success
of
this
interview
provoked
other
attempts
on
the
part
of
the
reporters
who
now
flocked
into
the
southwest
ere
long
particulars
began
to
pour
in
of
fairbrother
s
painful
journey
south
after
his
illness
set
in
the
clerk
of
the
hotel
in
el
moro
where
the
great
s
name
was
found
registered
at
the
time
of
the
murder
told
a
story
which
made
very
good
reading
for
those
who
were
more
interested
in
the
sufferings
and
experiences
of
the
millionaire
husband
of
the
murdered
lady
than
in
those
of
the
unhappy
but
comparatively
insignificant
man
upon
whom
public
opinion
had
cast
the
odium
of
her
death
it
seems
that
when
the
first
news
came
of
the
great
crime
which
had
taken
place
in
new
york
fairbrother
was
absent
from
the
hotel
on
a
prospecting
tour
through
the
adjacent
mountains
couriers
had
been
sent
after
him
and
it
was
one
of
these
who
finally
brought
him
into
town
he
had
been
found
wandering
alone
on
horseback
among
the
defiles
of
an
untraveled
region
sick
and
almost
incoherent
from
fever
indeed
his
condition
was
such
that
neither
the
courier
nor
such
others
as
saw
him
had
the
heart
to
tell
him
the
dreadful
news
from
new
york
or
even
to
show
him
the
papers
to
their
great
relief
he
betrayed
no
curiosity
in
them
all
he
wanted
was
a
berth
in
the
first
train
going
south
and
this
was
an
easy
way
for
them
out
of
a
great
responsibility
they
listened
to
his
wishes
and
saw
him
safely
aboard
with
such
alacrity
and
with
so
many
precautions
against
his
being
disturbed
that
they
have
never
doubted
that
he
left
el
moro
in
total
ignorance
not
only
of
the
circumstances
of
his
great
bereavement
but
of
the
bereavement
itself
this
ignorance
which
he
appeared
to
have
carried
with
him
to
the
placide
was
regarded
by
those
who
knew
him
best
as
proving
the
truth
of
the
affirmation
elicited
from
him
in
the
pauses
of
his
delirium
of
the
genuineness
of
the
stone
which
had
passed
from
his
hands
to
those
of
his
wife
at
the
time
of
their
separation
and
further
despatches
coming
in
some
private
and
some
official
but
all
insisting
upon
the
fact
that
it
would
be
weeks
before
he
would
be
in
a
condition
to
submit
to
any
sort
of
examination
on
a
subject
so
painful
the
authorities
in
new
york
decided
to
wait
no
longer
for
his
testimony
but
to
proceed
at
once
with
the
inquest
great
as
is
the
temptation
to
give
a
detailed
account
of
proceedings
which
were
of
such
moment
to
myself
and
to
every
word
of
which
i
listened
with
the
eagerness
of
a
novice
and
the
anguish
of
a
woman
who
sees
her
lover
s
reputation
at
the
mercy
of
a
verdict
which
may
stigmatize
him
as
a
possible
criminal
i
see
no
reason
for
encumbering
my
narrative
with
what
for
the
most
part
would
be
a
mere
repetition
of
facts
already
known
to
you
durand
s
intimate
and
suggestive
connection
with
this
crime
the
explanations
he
had
to
give
of
this
connection
frequently
bizarre
and
i
must
acknowledge
not
always
convincing
nothing
could
alter
these
nor
change
the
fact
of
the
undoubted
cowardice
he
displayed
in
hiding
fairbrother
s
gloves
in
my
unfortunate
little
bag
as
for
the
mystery
of
the
warning
it
remained
as
much
of
a
mystery
as
ever
nor
did
any
better
success
follow
an
attempt
to
fix
the
ownership
of
the
stiletto
though
a
was
exhausted
in
an
endeavor
to
show
that
the
latter
might
have
come
into
durand
s
possession
in
some
of
the
many
visits
he
was
shown
to
have
made
of
late
to
various
in
and
out
of
new
york
city
i
had
expected
all
this
just
as
i
had
expected
grey
to
be
absent
from
the
proceedings
and
his
testimony
ignored
but
this
expectation
did
not
make
the
ordeal
any
easier
and
when
i
noticed
the
effect
of
witness
after
witness
leaving
the
stand
without
having
improved
durand
s
position
by
a
jot
or
offering
any
new
clue
capable
of
turning
suspicion
into
other
directions
i
felt
my
spirit
harden
and
my
purpose
strengthen
till
i
hardly
knew
myself
i
must
have
frightened
my
uncle
for
his
hand
was
always
on
my
arm
and
his
chiding
voice
in
my
ear
bidding
me
beware
not
only
for
my
own
sake
and
his
but
for
that
of
durand
whose
eye
was
seldom
away
from
my
face
the
verdict
however
was
not
the
one
i
had
so
deeply
dreaded
while
it
did
not
exonerate
durand
it
did
not
openly
accuse
him
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
giving
him
a
smile
of
congratulation
and
renewed
hope
when
i
saw
my
little
detective
the
one
who
had
spied
the
gloves
in
my
bag
at
the
ball
advance
and
place
his
hand
upon
his
arm
the
police
had
gone
a
step
further
than
the
coroner
s
jury
and
durand
was
arrested
before
my
eyes
on
a
charge
of
murder
durand
s
visits
to
the
as
explained
by
him
were
made
with
a
view
of
finding
a
casket
in
which
to
place
his
diamond
this
explanation
was
looked
upon
with
as
much
doubt
as
the
others
he
had
offered
where
the
situation
seemed
to
be
of
a
compromising
character
ix
the
mouse
nibbles
at
the
net
the
next
day
saw
me
at
police
headquarters
begging
an
interview
from
the
inspector
with
the
intention
of
confiding
to
him
a
theory
which
must
either
cost
me
his
sympathy
or
open
the
way
to
a
new
inquiry
which
i
felt
sure
would
lead
to
durand
s
complete
exoneration
i
chose
this
gentleman
for
my
confidant
from
among
all
those
with
whom
i
had
been
brought
in
contact
by
my
position
as
witness
in
a
case
of
this
magnitude
first
because
he
had
been
present
at
the
most
tragic
moment
of
my
life
and
secondly
because
i
was
conscious
of
a
sympathetic
bond
between
us
which
would
insure
me
a
kind
hearing
however
ridiculous
my
idea
might
appear
to
him
i
was
assured
that
he
would
treat
me
with
consideration
and
not
visit
whatever
folly
i
might
be
guilty
of
on
the
head
of
him
for
whom
i
risked
my
reputation
for
good
sense
nor
was
i
disappointed
in
this
inspector
dalzell
s
air
was
fatherly
and
his
tone
altogether
gentle
as
in
reply
to
my
excuses
for
troubling
him
with
my
opinions
he
told
me
that
in
a
case
of
such
importance
he
was
glad
to
receive
the
impressions
even
of
such
a
prejudiced
little
partizan
as
myself
the
word
fired
me
and
i
spoke
you
consider
durand
guilty
and
so
do
many
others
i
fear
in
spite
of
his
long
record
for
honesty
and
uprightness
and
why
because
you
will
not
admit
the
possibility
of
another
person
s
guilt
a
person
standing
so
high
in
private
and
public
estimation
that
the
very
idea
seems
preposterous
and
little
short
of
insulting
to
the
country
of
which
he
is
an
acknowledged
my
dear
the
inspector
had
actually
risen
his
expression
and
whole
attitude
showed
shock
but
i
did
not
quail
i
only
subdued
my
manner
and
spoke
with
quieter
conviction
i
am
aware
said
i
how
words
so
daring
must
impress
you
but
listen
sir
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
before
you
utterly
condemn
me
i
acknowledge
that
it
is
the
frightful
position
into
which
i
threw
durand
by
my
officious
attempt
to
right
him
which
has
driven
me
to
make
this
second
effort
to
fix
the
crime
on
the
only
other
man
who
had
possible
access
to
fairbrother
at
the
fatal
moment
how
could
i
live
in
inaction
how
could
you
expect
me
to
weigh
for
a
moment
this
foreigner
s
reputation
against
that
of
my
own
lover
if
i
have
reasons
reasons
reasons
which
would
appeal
to
all
if
instead
of
this
person
s
having
an
international
reputation
at
his
back
he
had
been
a
simple
gentleman
like
durand
would
you
not
consider
me
entitled
to
speak
certainly
but
you
have
no
confidence
in
my
reasons
inspector
they
may
not
weigh
against
that
splash
of
blood
on
durand
s
but
such
as
they
are
i
must
give
them
but
first
it
will
be
necessary
for
you
to
accept
for
the
nonce
durand
s
statements
as
true
are
you
willing
to
do
this
i
will
then
a
harder
thing
yet
to
put
some
confidence
in
my
judgment
i
saw
the
man
and
did
not
like
him
long
before
any
intimation
of
the
evening
s
tragedy
had
turned
suspicion
on
any
one
i
watched
him
as
i
watched
others
i
saw
that
he
had
not
come
to
the
ball
to
please
ramsdell
or
for
any
pleasure
he
himself
hoped
to
reap
from
social
intercourse
but
for
some
purpose
much
more
important
and
that
this
purpose
was
connected
with
fairbrother
s
diamond
indifferent
almost
morose
before
she
came
upon
the
scene
he
brightened
to
a
surprising
extent
the
moment
he
found
himself
in
her
presence
not
because
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
for
he
scarcely
honored
her
face
or
even
her
superb
figure
with
a
look
all
his
glances
were
centered
on
her
large
fan
which
in
swaying
to
and
fro
alternately
hid
and
revealed
the
splendor
on
her
breast
and
when
by
chance
it
hung
suspended
for
a
moment
in
her
forgetful
hand
and
he
caught
a
full
glimpse
of
the
great
gem
i
perceived
such
a
change
in
his
face
that
if
nothing
more
had
occurred
that
night
to
give
prominence
to
this
woman
and
her
diamond
i
should
have
carried
home
the
conviction
that
interests
of
no
common
import
lay
behind
a
feeling
so
extraordinarily
fanciful
my
dear
miss
van
arsdale
i
interesting
but
i
know
i
have
not
yet
touched
on
fact
but
facts
are
coming
he
stared
evidently
he
was
not
accustomed
to
hear
the
law
laid
down
in
this
fashion
by
a
midget
of
my
proportions
go
on
said
he
happily
i
have
no
clerk
here
to
i
would
not
speak
if
you
had
these
are
words
for
but
one
ear
as
yet
not
even
my
uncle
suspects
the
direction
of
my
proceed
he
again
enjoined
upon
which
i
plunged
into
my
subject
mrs
fairbrother
wore
the
real
diamond
and
no
imitation
to
the
ball
of
this
i
feel
sure
the
bit
of
glass
or
paste
displayed
to
the
coroner
s
jury
was
bright
enough
but
it
was
not
the
star
of
light
i
saw
burning
on
her
breast
as
she
passed
me
on
her
way
to
the
miss
van
arsdale
the
interest
which
durand
displayed
in
it
the
marked
excitement
into
which
he
was
thrown
by
his
first
view
of
its
size
and
splendor
confirm
in
my
mind
the
evidence
which
he
gave
on
oath
and
he
is
a
diamond
expert
you
know
and
must
have
been
very
well
aware
that
he
would
injure
rather
than
help
his
cause
by
this
admission
that
at
that
time
he
believed
the
stone
to
be
real
and
of
immense
value
wearing
such
a
gem
then
she
entered
the
fatal
alcove
and
with
a
smile
on
her
face
prepared
to
employ
her
fascinations
on
whoever
chanced
to
come
within
their
reach
but
now
something
happened
please
let
me
tell
it
my
own
way
a
shout
from
the
driveway
or
a
bit
of
snow
thrown
against
the
window
drew
her
attention
to
a
man
standing
below
holding
up
a
note
fastened
to
the
end
of
a
i
do
not
know
whether
or
not
you
have
found
that
man
if
you
have
the
inspector
made
no
sign
i
judge
that
you
have
not
so
i
may
go
on
with
my
suppositions
fairbrother
took
in
this
note
she
may
have
expected
it
and
for
this
reason
chose
the
alcove
to
sit
in
or
it
may
have
been
a
surprise
to
her
probably
we
shall
never
know
the
whole
truth
about
it
but
what
we
can
know
and
do
if
you
are
still
holding
to
our
compact
and
viewing
this
crime
in
the
light
of
durand
s
explanations
is
that
it
made
a
change
in
her
and
made
her
anxious
to
rid
herself
of
the
diamond
it
has
been
decided
that
the
hurried
scrawl
should
read
take
warning
he
means
to
be
at
the
ball
expect
trouble
if
you
do
not
give
him
the
diamond
or
something
to
that
effect
but
why
was
it
passed
up
to
her
unfinished
was
the
haste
too
great
i
hardly
think
so
i
believe
in
another
explanation
which
points
with
startling
directness
to
the
possibility
that
the
person
referred
to
in
this
broken
communication
was
not
durand
but
one
whom
i
need
not
name
and
that
the
reason
you
have
failed
to
find
the
messenger
of
whose
appearance
you
have
received
definite
information
is
that
you
have
not
looked
among
the
servants
of
a
certain
distinguished
visitor
in
town
oh
i
burst
forth
with
feverish
volubility
as
i
saw
the
inspector
s
lips
open
in
what
could
not
fail
to
be
a
sarcastic
utterance
i
know
what
you
feel
tempted
to
reply
why
should
a
servant
deliver
a
warning
against
his
own
master
if
you
will
be
patient
with
me
you
will
soon
see
but
first
i
wish
to
make
it
clear
that
fairbrother
having
received
this
warning
just
before
durand
appeared
in
the
alcove
reckless
scheming
woman
that
she
was
sought
to
rid
herself
of
the
object
against
which
it
was
directed
in
the
way
we
have
temporarily
accepted
as
true
relying
on
her
arts
and
possibly
misconceiving
the
nature
of
durand
s
interest
in
her
she
hands
over
the
diamond
hidden
in
her
gloves
which
he
without
suspicion
carries
away
with
him
thus
linking
himself
indissolubly
to
a
great
crime
of
which
another
was
the
perpetrator
that
other
or
so
i
believe
from
my
very
heart
of
hearts
was
the
man
i
saw
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
alcove
a
few
minutes
before
i
passed
into
the
i
stopped
with
a
gasp
hardly
able
to
meet
the
stern
and
forbidding
look
with
which
the
inspector
sought
to
restrain
what
he
evidently
considered
the
senseless
ravings
of
a
child
but
i
had
come
there
to
speak
and
i
hastily
proceeded
before
the
rebuke
thus
expressed
could
formulate
itself
into
words
i
have
some
excuse
for
a
declaration
so
monstrous
perhaps
i
am
the
only
person
who
can
satisfy
you
in
regard
to
a
certain
fact
about
which
you
have
expressed
some
curiosity
inspector
have
you
ever
solved
the
mystery
of
the
two
broken
found
amongst
the
debris
at
fairbrother
s
feet
it
did
not
come
out
in
the
inquest
i
not
yet
he
cried
but
you
can
not
tell
me
anything
about
them
possibly
not
but
i
can
tell
you
this
when
i
reached
the
door
that
evening
i
looked
back
and
providentially
or
otherwise
only
the
future
can
determine
that
detected
grey
in
the
act
of
lifting
two
cups
from
a
tray
left
by
some
waiter
on
a
table
standing
just
outside
the
door
i
did
not
see
where
he
carried
them
i
only
saw
his
face
turned
toward
the
alcove
and
as
there
was
no
other
lady
there
or
anywhere
near
there
i
have
dared
to
think
here
the
inspector
found
speech
you
saw
grey
lift
two
cups
and
turn
toward
the
alcove
at
a
moment
we
all
know
to
have
been
critical
you
should
have
told
me
this
before
he
may
be
a
possible
i
scarcely
listened
i
was
too
full
of
my
own
argument
there
were
other
people
in
the
hall
especially
at
my
end
of
it
a
perfect
throng
was
coming
from
the
where
the
dancing
had
been
and
it
might
easily
be
that
he
could
both
enter
and
leave
that
secluded
spot
without
attracting
attention
he
had
shown
too
early
and
much
too
unmistakably
his
lack
of
interest
in
the
general
company
for
his
every
movement
to
be
watched
as
at
his
first
arrival
but
this
is
simple
conjecture
what
i
have
to
say
next
is
evidence
the
stiletto
have
you
studied
it
sir
i
have
from
the
pictures
it
is
very
quaint
and
among
the
devices
on
the
handle
is
one
that
especially
attracted
my
attention
see
this
is
what
i
and
i
handed
him
a
drawing
which
i
had
made
with
some
care
in
expectation
of
this
very
interview
he
surveyed
it
with
some
astonishment
i
understand
i
pursued
in
trembling
tones
for
i
was
much
affected
by
my
own
daring
that
no
one
has
so
far
succeeded
in
tracing
this
weapon
to
its
owner
why
didn
t
your
experts
study
heraldry
and
the
devices
of
great
houses
they
would
have
found
that
this
one
is
not
unknown
in
england
i
can
tell
you
on
whose
blazon
it
can
often
be
seen
and
so
could
i
astonish
the
inspector
i
was
not
the
only
one
to
tremble
now
this
man
of
infinite
experience
and
daily
contact
with
crime
had
turned
as
pale
as
ever
i
myself
had
done
in
face
of
a
threatening
calamity
i
shall
see
about
this
he
muttered
crumpling
the
paper
in
his
hand
but
this
is
a
very
terrible
business
you
are
plunging
me
into
i
sincerely
hope
that
you
are
not
heedlessly
misleading
i
am
correct
in
my
facts
if
that
is
what
you
mean
said
i
the
stiletto
is
an
english
heirloom
and
bears
on
its
blade
among
other
devices
that
of
grey
s
family
on
the
female
side
but
that
is
not
all
i
want
to
say
if
the
blow
was
struck
to
obtain
the
diamond
the
shock
of
not
finding
it
on
his
victim
must
have
been
terrible
now
grey
s
heart
if
my
whole
theory
is
not
utterly
false
was
set
upon
obtaining
this
stone
your
eye
was
not
on
him
as
mine
was
when
you
made
your
appearance
in
the
hall
with
the
recovered
jewel
he
showed
astonishment
eagerness
and
a
determination
which
finally
led
him
forward
as
you
know
with
the
request
to
take
the
diamond
in
his
hand
why
did
he
want
to
take
it
in
his
hand
and
why
having
taken
it
did
he
drop
it
a
diamond
supposed
to
be
worth
an
ordinary
man
s
fortune
because
he
was
startled
by
a
cry
he
chose
to
consider
the
traditional
one
of
his
family
proclaiming
death
is
it
likely
sir
is
it
conceivable
even
that
any
such
cry
as
we
heard
could
in
this
day
and
generation
ring
through
such
an
assemblage
unless
it
came
with
ventriloquial
power
from
his
own
lips
you
observed
that
he
turned
his
back
that
his
face
was
hidden
from
us
discreet
and
reticent
as
we
have
all
been
and
careful
in
our
criticisms
of
so
bizarre
an
event
there
still
must
be
many
to
question
the
reality
of
such
superstitious
fears
and
some
to
ask
if
such
a
sound
could
be
without
human
agency
and
a
very
guilty
agency
too
inspector
i
am
but
a
child
in
your
estimation
and
i
feel
my
position
in
this
matter
much
more
keenly
than
you
do
but
i
would
not
be
true
to
the
man
whom
i
have
unwittingly
helped
to
place
in
his
present
unenviable
position
if
i
did
not
tell
you
that
in
my
judgment
this
cry
was
a
spurious
one
employed
by
the
gentleman
himself
as
an
excuse
for
dropping
the
and
why
should
he
wish
to
drop
the
stone
because
of
the
fraud
he
meditated
because
it
offered
him
an
opportunity
for
substituting
a
false
stone
for
the
real
did
you
not
notice
a
change
in
the
aspect
of
this
jewel
dating
from
this
very
moment
did
it
shine
with
as
much
brilliancy
in
your
hand
when
you
received
it
back
as
when
you
passed
it
over
nonsense
i
do
not
know
it
is
all
too
absurd
for
yet
he
did
stop
to
argue
saying
in
the
next
breath
you
forget
that
the
stone
has
a
setting
would
you
claim
that
this
gentleman
of
family
place
and
political
distinction
had
planned
this
hideous
crime
with
sufficient
premeditation
to
have
provided
himself
with
the
exact
counterpart
of
a
brooch
which
it
is
highly
improbable
he
ever
saw
you
would
make
him
out
a
cagliostro
or
something
worse
miss
van
arsdale
i
fear
your
theory
will
topple
over
of
its
own
he
was
very
patient
with
me
he
did
not
show
me
the
door
yet
such
a
substitution
took
place
and
took
place
that
evening
i
insisted
the
bit
of
paste
shown
us
at
the
inquest
was
never
the
gem
fairbrother
wore
on
entering
the
alcove
besides
where
all
is
sensation
why
cavil
at
one
more
improbability
grey
may
have
come
over
to
america
for
no
other
reason
he
is
known
as
a
collector
and
when
a
man
has
a
passion
for
he
is
known
as
a
collector
in
his
own
i
was
not
told
nor
i
but
i
found
it
how
my
dear
child
how
by
a
cablegram
or
you
cabled
his
name
to
england
no
inspector
uncle
has
a
code
and
i
made
use
of
it
to
ask
a
friend
in
london
for
a
list
of
the
most
noted
diamond
fanciers
in
the
country
grey
s
name
was
third
on
the
he
gave
me
a
look
in
which
admiration
was
strangely
blended
with
doubt
and
apprehension
you
are
making
a
brave
struggle
said
he
but
it
is
a
hopeless
i
have
one
more
confidence
to
repose
in
you
the
nurse
who
has
charge
of
miss
grey
was
in
my
class
in
the
hospital
we
love
each
other
and
to
her
i
dared
appeal
on
one
point
inspector
here
my
voice
unconsciously
fell
as
he
impetuously
drew
nearer
a
note
was
sent
from
that
sick
chamber
on
the
night
of
the
ball
a
note
surreptitiously
written
by
miss
grey
while
the
nurse
was
in
an
adjoining
room
the
messenger
was
grey
s
valet
and
its
destination
the
house
in
which
her
father
was
enjoying
his
position
as
chief
guest
she
says
that
it
was
meant
for
him
but
i
have
dared
to
think
that
the
valet
would
tell
a
different
story
my
friend
did
not
see
what
her
patient
wrote
but
she
acknowledged
that
if
her
patient
wrote
more
than
two
words
the
result
must
have
been
an
unintelligible
scrawl
since
she
was
too
weak
to
hold
a
pencil
firmly
and
so
nearly
blind
that
she
would
have
had
to
feel
her
way
over
the
the
inspector
started
and
rising
hastily
went
to
his
desk
from
which
he
presently
brought
the
scrap
of
paper
which
had
already
figured
in
the
inquest
as
the
mysterious
communication
taken
from
fairbrother
s
hand
by
the
coroner
pressing
it
out
flat
he
took
another
look
at
it
then
glanced
up
in
visible
discomposure
it
has
always
looked
to
us
as
if
written
in
the
dark
by
an
agitated
hand
but
i
said
nothing
the
broken
and
unfinished
scrawl
was
sufficiently
eloquent
did
your
friend
declare
miss
grey
to
have
written
with
a
pencil
and
on
a
small
piece
of
unruled
paper
yes
the
pencil
was
at
her
bedside
the
paper
was
torn
from
a
book
which
lay
there
she
did
not
put
the
note
when
written
in
an
envelope
but
gave
it
to
the
valet
just
as
it
was
he
is
an
old
man
and
had
come
to
her
room
for
some
final
the
nurse
saw
all
this
has
she
that
book
no
it
went
out
next
morning
with
the
scraps
it
was
some
pamphlet
i
the
inspector
turned
the
morsel
of
paper
over
and
over
in
his
hand
what
is
this
nurse
s
name
henrietta
does
she
share
your
doubts
i
can
not
you
have
seen
her
often
no
only
the
one
is
she
discreet
very
on
this
subject
she
will
be
like
the
grave
unless
forced
by
you
to
and
miss
grey
she
is
still
ill
too
ill
to
be
disturbed
by
questions
especially
on
so
delicate
a
topic
but
she
is
getting
well
fast
her
father
s
fears
as
we
heard
them
expressed
on
one
memorable
occasion
were
ill
founded
slowly
the
inspector
inserted
this
scrap
of
paper
between
the
folds
of
his
pocketbook
he
did
not
give
me
another
look
though
i
stood
trembling
before
him
was
he
in
any
way
convinced
or
was
he
simply
seeking
for
the
most
considerate
way
in
which
to
dismiss
me
and
my
abominable
theory
i
could
not
gather
his
intentions
from
his
expression
and
was
feeling
very
faint
and
when
he
suddenly
turned
upon
me
with
the
remark
a
girl
as
ill
as
you
say
miss
grey
was
must
have
had
some
very
pressing
matter
on
her
mind
to
attempt
to
write
and
send
a
message
under
such
difficulties
according
to
your
idea
she
had
some
notion
of
her
father
s
designs
and
wished
to
warn
fairbrother
against
them
but
don
t
you
see
that
such
conduct
as
this
would
be
preposterous
nay
unparalleled
in
persons
of
their
distinction
you
must
find
some
other
explanation
for
miss
grey
s
seemingly
mysterious
action
and
i
an
agent
of
crime
other
than
one
of
england
s
most
reputable
so
that
durand
is
shown
the
same
consideration
i
am
content
said
i
it
is
the
truth
and
the
truth
only
i
desire
i
am
willing
to
trust
my
cause
with
he
looked
none
too
grateful
for
this
confidence
indeed
now
that
i
look
back
on
this
scene
i
do
not
wonder
that
he
shrank
from
the
responsibility
thus
foisted
upon
him
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
he
asked
prove
something
prove
that
i
am
altogether
wrong
or
altogether
right
or
if
proof
is
not
possible
pray
allow
me
the
privilege
of
doing
what
i
can
myself
to
clear
up
the
you
there
was
apprehension
disapprobation
almost
menace
in
his
tone
i
bore
it
with
as
steady
and
modest
a
glance
as
possible
saying
when
i
thought
he
was
about
to
speak
again
i
will
do
nothing
without
your
sanction
i
realize
the
dangers
of
this
inquiry
and
the
disgrace
that
would
follow
if
our
attempt
was
suspected
before
proof
reached
a
point
sufficient
to
justify
it
it
is
not
an
open
attack
i
meditate
but
one
here
i
whispered
in
his
ear
for
several
minutes
when
i
had
finished
he
gave
me
a
prolonged
stare
then
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
you
are
a
little
wonder
he
declared
but
your
ideas
are
very
quixotic
very
however
he
added
suddenly
growing
grave
something
i
must
admit
may
be
excused
a
young
girl
who
finds
herself
forced
to
choose
between
the
guilt
of
her
lover
and
that
of
a
man
esteemed
great
by
the
world
but
altogether
removed
from
her
and
her
natural
you
acknowledge
then
that
it
lies
between
these
two
i
see
no
third
said
he
i
drew
a
breath
of
relief
don
t
deceive
yourself
miss
van
arsdale
it
is
not
among
the
possibilities
that
grey
has
had
any
connection
with
this
crime
he
is
an
eccentric
man
that
s
but
but
i
shall
do
my
duty
i
shall
satisfy
you
and
myself
on
certain
points
and
if
i
hardly
breathed
there
is
the
least
doubt
i
will
see
you
again
and
the
change
he
saw
in
me
frightened
away
the
end
of
his
sentence
turning
upon
me
with
some
severity
he
declared
there
are
nine
hundred
and
chances
in
a
thousand
that
my
next
word
to
you
will
be
to
prepare
yourself
for
durand
s
arraignment
and
trial
but
an
infinitesimal
chance
remains
to
the
contrary
if
you
choose
to
trust
to
it
i
can
only
admire
your
pluck
and
the
great
confidence
you
show
in
your
unfortunate
and
with
this
encouragement
i
was
forced
to
be
content
not
only
for
that
day
but
for
many
days
when
xi
the
inspector
astonishes
me
but
before
i
proceed
to
relate
what
happened
at
the
end
of
those
two
weeks
i
must
say
a
word
or
two
in
regard
to
what
happened
during
them
nothing
happened
to
improve
durand
s
position
and
nothing
openly
to
compromise
grey
s
fairbrother
from
whose
testimony
many
of
us
hoped
something
would
yet
be
gleaned
calculated
to
give
a
turn
to
the
suspicion
now
centered
on
one
man
continued
ill
in
new
mexico
and
all
that
could
be
learned
from
him
of
any
importance
was
contained
in
a
short
letter
dictated
from
his
bed
in
which
he
affirmed
that
the
diamond
when
it
left
him
was
in
a
unique
setting
procured
by
himself
in
france
that
he
knew
of
no
other
jewel
similarly
mounted
and
that
if
the
false
gem
was
set
according
to
his
own
description
the
probabilities
were
that
the
imitation
stone
had
been
put
in
place
of
the
real
one
under
his
wife
s
direction
and
in
some
workshop
in
new
york
as
she
was
not
the
woman
to
take
the
trouble
to
send
abroad
for
anything
she
could
get
done
in
this
country
the
description
followed
it
coincided
with
the
one
we
all
knew
this
was
something
of
a
blow
to
me
public
opinion
would
naturally
reflect
that
of
the
husband
and
it
would
require
very
strong
evidence
indeed
to
combat
a
logical
supposition
of
this
kind
with
one
so
forced
and
seemingly
extravagant
as
that
upon
which
my
own
theory
was
based
yet
truth
often
transcends
imagination
and
having
confidence
in
the
inspector
s
integrity
i
subdued
my
impatience
for
a
week
almost
for
two
when
my
suspense
and
rapidly
culminating
dread
of
some
action
being
taken
against
durand
were
suddenly
cut
short
by
a
message
from
the
inspector
followed
by
his
speedy
presence
in
my
uncle
s
house
we
have
a
little
room
on
our
parlor
floor
very
snug
and
secluded
and
in
this
room
i
received
him
seldom
have
i
dreaded
a
meeting
more
and
seldom
have
i
been
met
with
greater
kindness
and
consideration
he
was
so
kind
that
i
feared
he
had
only
disappointing
news
to
communicate
but
his
first
words
reassured
me
he
said
i
have
come
to
you
on
a
matter
of
importance
we
have
found
enough
truth
in
the
suppositions
you
advanced
at
our
last
interview
to
warrant
us
in
the
attempt
you
yourself
proposed
for
the
elucidation
of
this
mystery
that
this
is
the
most
risky
and
altogether
the
most
unpleasant
duty
which
i
have
encountered
during
my
several
years
of
service
i
am
willing
to
acknowledge
to
one
so
sensible
and
at
the
same
time
of
so
much
modesty
as
yourself
this
english
gentleman
has
a
reputation
which
lifts
him
far
above
any
unworthy
suspicion
and
were
it
not
for
the
favorable
impression
made
upon
us
by
durand
in
a
long
talk
we
had
with
him
last
night
i
would
sooner
resign
my
place
than
pursue
this
matter
against
him
success
would
create
a
horror
on
both
sides
the
water
unprecedented
during
my
career
while
failure
would
bring
down
ridicule
on
us
which
would
destroy
the
prestige
of
the
whole
force
do
you
see
my
difficulty
miss
van
arsdale
we
can
not
even
approach
this
haughty
and
highly
reputable
englishman
with
questions
without
calling
down
on
us
the
wrath
of
the
whole
english
nation
we
must
be
sure
before
we
make
a
move
and
for
us
to
be
sure
where
the
evidence
is
all
circumstantial
i
know
of
no
better
plan
than
the
one
you
were
pleased
to
suggest
which
at
the
time
i
was
pleased
to
call
drawing
a
long
breath
i
surveyed
him
timidly
never
had
i
so
realized
my
presumption
or
experienced
such
a
thrill
of
joy
in
my
frightened
yet
elated
heart
they
believed
in
anson
s
innocence
and
they
trusted
me
insignificant
as
i
was
it
was
to
my
exertions
this
great
result
was
due
as
i
realized
this
i
felt
my
heart
swell
and
my
throat
close
in
despair
of
speaking
i
held
out
my
hands
he
took
them
kindly
and
seemed
to
be
quite
satisfied
such
a
little
trembling
amazon
he
cried
shall
you
have
courage
to
undertake
the
task
before
you
if
not
oh
but
i
have
said
i
it
is
your
goodness
and
the
surprise
of
it
all
which
unnerves
me
i
can
go
through
what
we
have
planned
if
you
think
the
secret
of
my
personality
and
interest
in
durand
can
be
kept
from
the
people
i
go
it
can
if
you
will
follow
our
advice
implicitly
you
say
that
you
know
the
doctor
and
that
he
stands
ready
to
recommend
you
in
case
miss
pierson
withdraws
her
yes
he
is
eager
to
give
me
a
chance
he
was
a
college
mate
of
my
father
how
will
you
explain
to
him
your
wish
to
enter
upon
your
duties
under
another
name
very
simply
i
have
already
told
him
that
the
publicity
given
my
name
in
the
late
proceedings
has
made
me
very
uncomfortable
that
my
first
case
of
nursing
would
require
all
my
and
that
if
he
did
not
think
it
wrong
i
should
like
to
go
to
it
under
my
mother
s
name
he
made
no
dissent
and
i
think
i
can
persuade
him
that
i
would
do
much
better
work
as
miss
ayers
than
as
the
too
miss
van
you
have
great
powers
of
persuasion
but
may
you
not
meet
people
at
the
hotel
who
know
you
i
shall
try
to
avoid
people
and
if
my
identity
is
discovered
its
effect
or
upon
one
we
find
it
difficult
to
mention
will
give
us
our
clue
if
he
has
no
guilty
interest
in
the
crime
my
connection
with
it
as
a
witness
will
not
disturb
him
besides
two
days
of
unsuspicious
acceptance
of
me
as
miss
grey
s
nurse
are
all
i
want
i
shall
take
immediate
opportunity
i
assure
you
to
make
the
test
i
mentioned
but
how
much
confidence
you
will
have
to
repose
in
me
i
comprehend
all
the
importance
of
my
undertaking
and
shall
work
as
if
my
honor
as
well
as
yours
were
at
i
am
sure
you
then
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
glad
that
i
was
small
and
plain
rather
than
tall
and
fascinating
like
so
many
of
my
friends
for
he
said
if
you
had
been
a
triumphant
beauty
depending
on
your
charms
as
a
woman
to
win
people
to
your
will
we
should
never
have
listened
to
your
proposition
or
risked
our
reputation
in
your
hands
it
is
your
wit
your
earnestness
and
your
quiet
determination
which
have
impressed
us
you
see
i
speak
plainly
i
do
so
because
i
respect
you
and
now
to
details
followed
after
these
were
well
understood
between
us
i
ventured
to
say
do
you
object
would
it
be
asking
too
much
if
i
requested
some
enlightenment
as
to
what
facts
you
have
discovered
about
grey
which
go
to
substantiate
my
theory
i
might
work
more
no
miss
van
arsdale
you
would
not
work
more
intelligently
and
you
know
it
but
you
have
the
natural
curiosity
of
one
whose
very
heart
is
bound
up
in
this
business
i
could
deny
you
what
you
ask
but
i
won
t
for
i
want
you
to
work
with
quiet
confidence
which
you
would
not
do
if
your
mind
were
taken
up
with
doubts
and
questions
miss
van
arsdale
one
surmise
of
yours
was
correct
a
man
was
sent
that
night
to
the
ramsdell
house
with
a
note
from
miss
grey
we
know
this
because
he
boasted
of
it
to
one
of
the
before
he
went
out
saying
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
glimpse
of
one
of
the
swellest
parties
of
the
season
it
is
also
true
that
this
man
was
grey
s
valet
an
old
servant
who
came
over
with
him
from
england
but
what
adds
weight
to
all
this
and
makes
us
regard
the
whole
affair
with
suspicion
is
the
additional
fact
that
this
man
received
his
dismissal
the
following
morning
and
has
not
been
seen
since
by
any
one
we
could
reach
this
looks
bad
to
begin
with
like
the
suppression
of
evidence
you
know
then
grey
has
not
been
the
same
man
since
that
night
he
is
full
of
care
and
this
care
is
not
entirely
in
connection
with
his
daughter
who
is
doing
very
well
and
bids
fair
to
be
up
in
a
few
days
but
all
this
would
be
nothing
if
we
had
not
received
advices
from
england
which
prove
that
grey
s
visit
here
has
an
element
of
mystery
in
it
there
was
every
reason
for
his
remaining
in
his
own
country
where
a
political
crisis
is
approaching
yet
he
crossed
the
water
bringing
his
sickly
daughter
with
him
the
explanation
as
volunteered
by
one
who
knew
him
well
was
this
that
only
his
desire
to
see
or
acquire
some
precious
object
for
his
collection
could
have
taken
him
across
the
ocean
at
this
time
nothing
else
rivaling
his
interest
in
governmental
affairs
still
this
would
be
nothing
if
a
stiletto
similar
to
the
one
employed
in
this
crime
had
not
once
formed
part
of
a
collection
of
curios
belonging
to
a
cousin
of
his
whom
he
often
visited
this
stiletto
has
been
missing
for
some
time
stolen
as
the
owner
declared
by
some
unknown
person
all
this
looks
bad
enough
but
when
i
tell
you
that
a
week
before
the
fatal
ball
at
ramsdell
s
grey
made
a
tour
of
the
jewelers
on
broadway
and
with
the
pretext
of
buying
a
diamond
for
his
daughter
entered
into
a
talk
about
famous
stones
ending
always
with
some
question
about
the
fairbrother
gem
you
will
see
that
his
interest
in
that
stone
is
established
and
that
it
only
remains
for
us
to
discover
if
that
interest
is
a
guilty
one
i
can
not
believe
this
possible
but
you
have
our
leave
to
make
your
experiment
and
see
only
do
not
count
too
much
on
his
superstition
if
he
is
the
criminal
you
imagine
the
cry
which
startled
us
all
at
a
certain
critical
instant
was
raised
by
himself
and
for
the
purpose
you
suggested
none
of
the
sensitiveness
often
shown
by
a
man
who
has
been
surprised
into
crime
will
be
his
relying
on
his
reputation
and
the
prestige
of
his
great
name
he
will
if
he
thinks
himself
under
fire
face
every
shock
i
see
i
understand
he
must
believe
himself
all
alone
then
the
natural
man
may
appear
i
thank
you
inspector
that
idea
is
of
inestimable
value
to
me
and
i
shall
act
on
it
i
do
not
say
immediately
not
on
the
first
day
and
possibly
not
on
the
second
but
as
soon
as
opportunity
offers
for
my
doing
what
i
have
planned
with
any
chance
of
success
and
now
advise
me
how
to
circumvent
my
uncle
and
aunt
who
must
never
know
to
what
an
undertaking
i
have
committed
inspector
dalzell
spared
me
another
fifteen
minutes
and
this
last
detail
was
arranged
then
he
rose
to
go
as
he
turned
from
me
he
said
and
i
answered
with
a
full
heart
but
a
voice
clear
as
my
purpose
xii
almost
this
is
your
patient
your
new
nurse
my
dear
what
did
you
say
your
name
is
miss
ayers
yes
grey
alice
oh
what
a
sweet
name
this
expressive
greeting
from
the
patient
herself
was
the
first
i
received
a
sting
which
brought
a
flush
into
my
cheek
which
i
would
fain
have
kept
down
since
a
change
of
nurses
was
necessary
i
am
glad
they
sent
me
one
like
you
the
feeble
but
musical
voice
went
on
and
i
saw
a
wasted
but
eager
hand
stretched
out
in
a
whirl
of
strong
feeling
i
advanced
to
take
it
i
had
not
counted
on
such
a
reception
i
had
not
expected
any
bond
of
congeniality
to
spring
up
between
this
english
girl
and
myself
to
make
my
purpose
hateful
to
me
yet
as
i
stood
there
looking
down
at
her
bright
if
wasted
face
i
felt
that
it
would
be
very
easy
to
love
so
gentle
and
cordial
a
being
and
dreaded
raising
my
eyes
to
the
gentleman
at
my
side
lest
i
should
see
something
in
him
to
hamper
me
and
make
this
attempt
which
i
had
undertaken
in
such
loyalty
of
spirit
a
misery
to
myself
and
ineffectual
to
the
man
i
had
hoped
to
save
by
it
when
i
did
look
up
and
catch
the
first
beams
of
grey
s
keen
blue
eyes
fixed
inquiringly
on
me
i
neither
knew
what
to
think
nor
how
to
act
he
was
tall
and
firmly
knit
and
had
an
intellectual
aspect
altogether
i
was
conscious
of
regarding
him
with
a
decided
feeling
of
awe
and
found
myself
forgetting
why
i
had
come
there
and
what
my
suspicions
were
suspicions
which
had
carried
hope
with
them
hope
for
myself
and
hope
for
my
lover
who
would
never
escape
the
opprobrium
even
if
he
did
the
punishment
of
this
great
crime
were
this
the
only
other
person
who
could
possibly
be
associated
with
it
found
to
be
the
fine
man
he
appeared
to
be
in
this
my
first
interview
with
him
perceiving
very
soon
that
his
apprehensions
in
my
regard
were
limited
to
a
fear
lest
i
should
not
feel
at
ease
in
my
new
home
under
the
restraint
of
a
presence
more
accustomed
to
intimidate
than
attract
strangers
i
threw
aside
all
doubts
of
myself
and
met
the
advances
of
both
father
and
daughter
with
that
quiet
confidence
which
my
position
there
demanded
the
result
both
gratified
and
grieved
me
as
a
nurse
entering
on
her
first
case
i
was
happy
as
a
woman
with
an
ulterior
object
in
view
verging
on
the
audacious
and
unspeakable
i
was
wretched
and
regretful
and
just
a
little
shaken
in
the
conviction
which
had
hitherto
upheld
me
i
was
therefore
but
poorly
prepared
to
meet
the
ordeal
which
awaited
me
when
a
little
later
in
the
day
grey
called
me
into
the
adjoining
room
and
after
saying
that
it
would
afford
him
great
relief
to
go
out
for
an
hour
or
so
asked
if
i
were
afraid
to
be
left
alone
with
my
patient
o
no
sir
i
began
but
stopped
in
secret
dismay
i
was
afraid
but
not
on
account
of
her
condition
rather
on
account
of
my
own
what
if
i
should
be
led
into
betraying
my
feelings
on
finding
myself
under
no
other
eye
than
her
own
what
if
the
temptation
to
probe
her
poor
sick
mind
should
prove
stronger
than
my
duty
toward
her
as
a
nurse
my
tones
were
hesitating
but
grey
paid
little
heed
his
mind
was
too
fixed
on
what
he
wished
to
say
himself
before
i
go
said
he
i
have
a
request
to
make
i
may
as
well
say
a
caution
to
give
you
do
not
i
pray
either
now
or
at
any
future
time
carry
or
allow
any
one
else
to
carry
newspapers
into
miss
grey
s
room
they
are
just
now
too
alarming
there
has
been
as
you
know
a
dreadful
murder
in
this
city
if
she
caught
one
glimpse
of
the
headlines
or
saw
so
much
as
the
name
of
fairbrother
which
which
is
a
name
she
knows
the
result
might
be
very
hurtful
to
her
she
is
not
only
extremely
sensitive
from
illness
but
from
temperament
will
you
be
careful
i
shall
be
it
was
such
an
effort
for
me
to
say
these
words
to
say
anything
in
the
state
of
mind
into
which
i
had
been
thrown
by
his
unexpected
allusion
to
this
subject
that
i
unfortunately
drew
his
attention
to
myself
and
it
was
with
what
i
felt
to
be
a
glance
of
doubt
that
he
added
with
decided
emphasis
you
must
consider
this
whole
subject
as
a
forbidden
one
in
this
family
only
cheerful
topics
are
suitable
for
the
if
miss
grey
attempts
to
introduce
any
other
stop
her
do
not
let
her
talk
about
anything
which
will
not
be
conducive
to
her
speedy
recovery
these
are
the
only
instructions
i
have
to
give
you
all
others
must
come
from
her
i
made
some
reply
with
as
little
show
of
emotion
as
possible
it
seemed
to
satisfy
him
for
his
face
cleared
as
he
kindly
observed
you
have
a
very
trustworthy
look
for
one
so
young
i
shall
rest
easy
while
you
are
with
her
and
i
shall
expect
you
to
be
always
with
her
when
i
am
not
every
moment
mind
she
is
never
to
be
left
alone
with
gossiping
servants
if
a
word
is
mentioned
in
her
hearing
about
this
crime
which
seems
to
be
in
everybody
s
mouth
i
shall
feel
forced
greatly
as
i
should
regret
the
fad
to
blame
this
was
a
but
i
kept
up
bravely
changing
color
perhaps
but
not
to
such
a
marked
degree
as
to
arouse
any
deeper
suspicion
in
his
mind
than
that
i
had
been
wounded
in
my
amour
propre
she
shall
be
well
guarded
said
i
you
may
trust
me
to
keep
from
her
all
avoidable
knowledge
of
this
he
bowed
and
i
was
about
to
leave
his
presence
when
he
detained
me
by
remarking
with
the
air
of
one
who
felt
that
some
explanation
was
necessary
i
was
at
the
ball
where
this
crime
took
place
naturally
it
has
made
a
deep
impression
on
me
and
would
on
her
if
she
heard
of
assuredly
i
murmured
wondering
if
he
would
say
more
and
how
i
should
have
the
courage
to
stand
there
and
listen
if
he
did
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
come
in
contact
with
crime
he
went
on
with
what
in
one
of
his
reserved
nature
seemed
a
hardly
natural
insistence
i
could
well
have
been
spared
the
experience
a
tragedy
with
which
one
has
been
even
thus
remotely
connected
produces
a
lasting
effect
upon
the
oh
yes
oh
yes
i
murmured
edging
involuntarily
toward
the
door
did
i
not
know
had
i
not
been
there
too
i
little
i
whom
he
stood
gazing
down
upon
from
such
a
height
little
realizing
the
fatality
which
united
us
and
what
was
even
a
more
overwhelming
thought
to
me
at
the
moment
the
fact
that
of
all
persons
in
the
world
the
shrinking
little
being
into
whose
eyes
he
was
then
looking
was
perhaps
his
greatest
enemy
and
the
one
person
great
or
small
from
whom
he
had
the
most
to
fear
but
i
was
no
enemy
to
his
gentle
daughter
and
the
relief
i
felt
at
finding
myself
thus
cut
off
by
my
own
promise
from
even
the
remotest
communication
with
her
on
this
forbidden
subject
was
genuine
and
sincere
but
the
father
what
was
i
to
think
of
the
father
alas
i
could
have
but
one
thought
admirable
as
he
appeared
in
all
lights
save
the
one
in
which
his
too
evident
connection
with
this
crime
had
placed
him
i
spent
the
hours
of
the
afternoon
in
alternately
watching
the
sleeping
face
of
my
patient
too
sweetly
calm
in
its
repose
or
so
it
seemed
for
the
mind
beneath
to
harbor
such
doubts
as
were
shown
in
the
warning
i
had
ascribed
to
her
and
vain
efforts
to
explain
by
any
other
hypothesis
than
that
of
guilt
the
extraordinary
evidence
which
linked
this
man
of
great
affairs
and
the
loftiest
repute
to
a
crime
involving
both
theft
and
murder
nor
did
the
struggle
end
that
night
it
was
renewed
with
still
greater
positiveness
the
next
day
as
i
witnessed
the
glances
which
from
time
to
time
passed
between
this
father
and
daughter
glances
full
of
doubt
and
question
on
both
sides
but
not
exactly
such
doubt
or
such
question
as
my
suspicions
called
for
or
so
i
thought
and
spent
another
day
or
two
hesitating
very
much
over
my
duty
when
coming
unexpectedly
upon
grey
one
evening
i
felt
all
my
doubts
revive
in
view
of
the
extraordinary
expression
of
dread
i
might
with
still
greater
truth
say
fear
which
informed
his
features
and
made
them
to
my
unaccustomed
eyes
almost
unrecognizable
he
was
sitting
at
his
desk
in
reverie
over
some
papers
which
he
seemed
not
to
have
touched
for
hours
and
when
at
some
movement
i
made
he
started
up
and
met
my
eye
i
could
swear
that
his
cheek
was
pale
the
firm
carriage
of
his
body
shaken
and
the
whole
man
a
victim
to
some
strong
and
secret
apprehension
he
vainly
sought
to
hide
when
i
ventured
to
tell
him
what
i
wanted
he
made
an
effort
and
pulled
himself
together
but
i
had
seen
him
with
his
mask
off
and
his
usually
calm
visage
and
mien
could
not
again
deceive
me
my
duties
kept
me
mainly
at
miss
grey
s
bedside
but
i
had
been
provided
with
a
little
room
across
the
hall
and
to
this
room
i
retired
very
soon
after
this
for
rest
and
a
necessary
understanding
with
myself
for
in
spite
of
this
experience
and
my
now
settled
convictions
my
purpose
required
whetting
the
indescribable
charm
the
extreme
refinement
and
nobility
of
manner
observable
in
both
grey
and
his
daughter
were
producing
their
effect
i
felt
guilty
constrained
whatever
my
convictions
the
impetus
to
act
was
leaving
me
how
could
i
recover
it
by
thinking
of
anson
durand
and
his
present
disgraceful
position
anson
durand
oh
how
the
feeling
surged
up
in
my
breast
as
that
name
slipped
from
my
lips
on
crossing
the
threshold
of
my
little
room
anson
durand
whom
i
believed
innocent
whom
i
loved
but
whom
i
was
betraying
with
every
moment
of
hesitation
in
which
i
allowed
myself
to
indulge
what
if
the
honorable
grey
is
an
eminent
statesman
a
dignified
scholarly
and
to
all
appearance
man
what
if
my
patient
is
sweet
and
affectionate
had
not
anson
qualities
as
excellent
in
their
way
rights
as
certain
and
a
hold
upon
myself
superior
to
any
claims
which
another
might
advance
drawing
a
little
note
from
my
pocket
i
eagerly
read
it
it
was
the
only
one
i
had
of
his
writing
the
only
letter
he
had
ever
written
me
i
had
already
it
a
hundred
times
but
as
i
once
more
repeated
to
myself
its
lines
i
felt
my
heart
grow
strong
and
fixed
in
the
determination
which
had
brought
me
into
this
family
restoring
the
letter
to
its
place
i
opened
my
gripsack
and
from
its
inmost
recesses
drew
forth
an
object
which
i
had
no
sooner
in
hand
than
a
natural
sense
of
disquietude
led
me
to
glance
apprehensively
first
at
the
door
then
at
the
window
though
i
had
locked
the
one
and
shaded
the
other
it
seemed
as
if
some
other
eye
besides
my
own
must
be
gazing
at
what
i
held
so
gingerly
in
hand
that
the
walls
were
watching
me
if
nothing
else
and
the
sensation
this
produced
was
so
exactly
like
that
of
guilt
or
what
i
imagined
to
be
guilt
that
i
was
forced
to
repeat
once
more
to
myself
that
it
was
not
a
good
man
s
overthrow
i
sought
or
even
a
bad
man
s
immunity
from
punishment
but
the
truth
the
absolute
truth
no
shame
could
equal
that
which
i
should
feel
if
by
any
now
i
failed
to
save
the
man
who
trusted
me
the
article
which
i
held
have
you
guessed
it
was
the
stiletto
with
which
fairbrother
had
been
killed
it
had
been
intrusted
to
me
by
the
police
for
a
definite
purpose
the
time
for
testing
that
purpose
had
come
or
so
nearly
come
that
i
felt
i
must
be
thinking
about
the
necessary
ways
and
means
unwinding
the
folds
of
tissue
paper
in
which
the
stiletto
was
wrapped
i
scrutinized
the
weapon
very
carefully
hitherto
i
had
seen
only
pictures
of
it
now
i
had
the
article
itself
in
my
hand
it
was
not
a
natural
one
for
a
young
woman
to
hold
a
woman
whose
taste
ran
more
toward
healing
than
inflicting
wounds
but
i
forced
myself
to
forget
why
the
end
of
its
blade
was
rusty
and
looked
mainly
at
the
devices
which
ornamented
the
handle
i
had
not
been
mistaken
in
them
they
belonged
to
the
house
of
grey
and
to
none
other
it
was
a
legitimate
inquiry
i
had
undertaken
however
the
matter
ended
i
should
always
have
these
historic
devices
for
my
excuse
my
plan
was
to
lay
this
dagger
on
grey
s
desk
at
a
moment
when
he
would
be
sure
to
see
it
and
i
to
see
him
if
he
betrayed
a
guilty
knowledge
of
this
fatal
steel
if
unconscious
of
my
presence
he
showed
surprise
and
apprehension
then
we
should
know
how
to
proceed
justice
would
be
loosed
from
constraint
and
the
police
feel
at
liberty
to
approach
him
it
was
a
delicate
task
this
i
realized
how
delicate
when
i
had
thrust
the
stiletto
out
of
sight
under
my
nurse
s
apron
and
started
to
cross
the
hall
should
i
find
the
library
clear
would
the
opportunity
be
given
me
to
approach
his
desk
or
should
i
have
to
carry
this
guilty
witness
of
a
crime
on
into
miss
grey
s
room
and
with
its
unholy
outline
pressing
a
semblance
of
itself
upon
my
breast
sit
at
that
innocent
pillow
meet
those
innocent
eyes
and
answer
the
gentle
inquiries
which
now
and
then
fell
from
the
sweetest
lips
i
have
ever
seen
smile
into
the
face
of
a
lonely
preoccupied
stranger
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
was
such
as
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
pass
through
this
in
order
to
reach
my
patient
s
bedroom
with
careful
tread
so
timed
as
not
to
appear
stealthy
i
accordingly
advanced
and
pushed
open
the
door
the
room
was
empty
grey
was
still
with
his
daughter
and
i
could
cross
the
floor
without
fear
but
never
had
i
entered
upon
a
task
requiring
more
courage
or
one
more
obnoxious
to
my
natural
instincts
i
hated
each
step
i
took
but
i
loved
the
man
for
whom
i
took
those
steps
and
moved
resolutely
on
only
as
i
reached
the
chair
in
which
grey
was
accustomed
to
sit
i
found
that
it
was
easier
to
plan
an
action
than
to
carry
it
out
home
life
and
the
domestic
virtues
had
always
appealed
to
me
more
than
a
man
s
greatness
the
position
which
this
man
held
in
his
own
country
his
usefulness
there
even
his
prestige
as
statesman
and
scholar
were
facts
but
very
dreamy
facts
to
me
while
his
feelings
as
a
father
the
place
he
held
in
his
daughter
s
heart
these
were
real
to
me
these
i
could
understand
and
it
was
of
these
and
not
of
his
place
as
a
man
that
this
his
favorite
seat
spoke
to
me
how
often
had
i
beheld
him
sit
by
the
hour
with
his
eye
on
the
door
behind
which
his
one
darling
lay
ill
even
now
it
was
easy
for
me
to
recall
his
face
as
i
had
sometimes
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
through
the
crack
of
the
suddenly
opened
door
and
i
felt
my
breast
heave
and
my
hand
falter
as
i
drew
forth
the
stiletto
and
moved
to
place
it
where
his
eye
would
fall
upon
it
on
his
leaving
his
daughter
s
bedside
but
my
hand
returned
quickly
to
my
breast
and
fell
hack
again
empty
a
pile
of
letters
lay
before
me
on
the
open
lid
of
the
desk
the
top
one
was
addressed
to
me
with
the
word
important
written
in
the
corner
i
did
not
know
the
writing
but
i
felt
that
i
should
open
and
read
this
letter
before
committing
myself
or
those
who
stood
back
of
me
to
this
desperate
undertaking
glancing
behind
me
and
seeing
that
the
door
into
miss
grey
s
room
was
ajar
i
caught
up
this
letter
and
rushed
with
it
back
into
my
own
room
as
i
surmised
it
was
from
the
inspector
and
as
i
read
it
i
realized
that
i
had
received
it
not
one
moment
too
soon
in
language
purposely
but
of
a
meaning
not
to
be
mistaken
it
advised
me
that
some
unforeseen
facts
had
come
to
light
which
altered
all
former
suspicions
and
made
the
little
surprise
i
had
planned
no
longer
necessary
there
was
no
allusion
to
durand
but
the
final
sentence
ran
drop
all
care
and
give
your
undivided
attention
to
your
xiii
the
missing
recommendation
my
patient
slept
that
night
but
i
did
not
the
shock
given
by
this
sudden
cry
of
halt
at
the
very
moment
i
was
about
to
make
my
great
move
the
uncertainty
as
to
what
it
meant
and
my
doubt
of
its
effect
upon
durand
s
position
put
me
on
the
anxious
seat
and
kept
my
thoughts
fully
occupied
till
morning
i
was
very
tired
and
must
have
shown
it
when
with
the
first
rays
of
a
very
meager
sun
miss
grey
softly
unclosed
her
eyes
and
found
me
looking
at
her
for
her
smile
had
a
sweet
compassion
in
it
and
she
said
as
she
pressed
my
hand
you
must
have
watched
me
all
night
i
never
saw
any
one
look
so
tired
or
so
good
she
softly
finished
i
had
rather
she
had
not
uttered
that
last
phrase
it
did
not
fit
me
at
the
moment
did
not
fit
me
perhaps
at
any
time
good
i
when
my
thoughts
had
not
been
with
her
but
with
durand
when
the
dominating
feeling
in
my
breast
was
not
that
of
relief
but
a
vague
regret
that
i
had
not
been
allowed
to
make
my
great
test
and
so
establish
to
my
own
satisfaction
at
least
the
perfect
innocence
of
my
lover
even
at
the
cost
of
untold
anguish
to
this
confiding
girl
upon
whose
gentle
spirit
the
very
thought
of
crime
would
cast
a
deadly
blight
i
must
have
flushed
certainly
i
showed
some
embarrassment
for
her
eyes
brightened
with
shy
laughter
as
she
whispered
you
do
not
like
to
be
praised
another
of
your
virtues
you
have
too
many
i
have
only
one
i
love
my
she
did
one
could
see
that
love
was
life
to
her
for
an
instant
i
trembled
how
near
i
had
been
to
wrecking
this
gentle
soul
was
she
safe
yet
i
was
not
sure
my
own
doubts
were
not
satisfied
i
awaited
the
papers
with
feverish
impatience
they
should
contain
news
news
of
what
ah
that
was
the
question
you
will
let
me
see
my
mail
this
morning
will
you
not
she
asked
as
i
busied
myself
about
her
that
is
for
the
doctor
to
say
i
smiled
you
are
certainly
better
this
it
is
so
hard
for
me
not
to
be
able
to
read
his
letters
or
to
write
a
word
to
relieve
his
thus
she
told
me
her
heart
s
secret
and
unconsciously
added
another
burden
to
my
already
too
heavy
load
i
was
on
my
way
to
give
some
orders
about
my
patient
s
breakfast
when
grey
came
into
the
and
met
me
face
to
face
he
had
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
and
my
heart
stood
still
as
i
noted
his
altered
looks
and
disturbed
manner
were
these
due
to
anything
he
had
found
in
those
columns
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
kept
my
eyes
from
the
paper
which
he
held
in
such
a
manner
as
to
disclose
its
glaring
these
i
dared
not
read
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
mine
how
is
miss
grey
how
is
my
daughter
he
asked
in
great
haste
and
uneasiness
is
she
better
this
morning
or
worse
better
i
assured
him
and
was
greatly
astonished
to
see
his
brow
instantly
clear
really
he
asked
you
really
consider
her
better
the
doctors
say
so
but
i
have
not
very
much
faith
in
doctors
in
a
case
like
this
he
added
i
have
seen
no
reason
to
distrust
them
i
protested
miss
grey
s
illness
while
severe
does
not
appear
to
be
of
an
alarming
nature
but
then
i
have
had
very
little
experience
out
of
the
hospital
i
am
young
yet
he
looked
as
if
he
quite
agreed
with
me
in
this
estimate
of
myself
and
with
a
brow
still
clouded
passed
into
his
daughter
s
room
the
paper
in
his
hand
before
i
joined
them
i
found
and
scanned
another
journal
expecting
great
things
i
was
both
surprised
and
disappointed
to
find
only
a
small
paragraph
devoted
to
the
fairbrother
case
in
this
it
was
stated
that
the
authorities
hoped
for
new
light
on
this
mystery
as
soon
as
they
had
located
a
certain
witness
whose
connection
with
the
crime
they
had
just
discovered
no
more
no
less
than
was
contained
in
inspector
dalzell
s
letter
how
could
i
bear
it
the
suspense
the
doubt
and
do
my
duty
to
my
patient
happily
i
had
no
choice
i
had
been
adjudged
equal
to
this
business
and
i
must
prove
myself
to
be
so
perhaps
my
courage
would
revive
after
i
had
had
my
breakfast
perhaps
then
i
should
be
able
to
fix
upon
the
identity
of
the
new
witness
something
which
i
found
myself
incapable
of
at
this
moment
these
thoughts
were
on
my
mind
as
i
crossed
the
rooms
on
my
way
back
to
miss
grey
s
bedside
by
the
time
i
reached
her
door
i
was
outwardly
calm
as
her
first
words
showed
oh
the
cheerful
smile
it
makes
me
feel
better
in
spite
of
if
she
could
have
seen
into
my
heart
grey
who
was
leaning
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
cast
me
a
quick
glance
which
was
not
without
its
suspicion
had
he
detected
me
playing
a
part
or
were
such
doubts
as
he
displayed
the
product
simply
of
his
own
uneasiness
i
was
not
able
to
decide
and
with
this
unanswered
question
added
to
the
number
already
troubling
me
i
was
forced
to
face
the
day
which
for
aught
i
knew
might
be
the
precursor
of
many
others
equally
trying
and
unsatisfactory
but
help
was
near
before
noon
i
received
a
message
from
my
uncle
to
the
effect
that
if
i
could
be
spared
he
would
be
glad
to
see
me
at
his
home
as
near
three
o
clock
as
possible
what
could
he
want
of
me
i
could
not
guess
and
it
was
with
great
inner
perturbation
that
having
won
grey
s
permission
i
responded
to
his
summons
i
found
my
uncle
awaiting
me
in
a
carriage
before
his
own
door
and
i
took
my
seat
at
his
side
without
the
least
idea
of
his
purpose
i
supposed
that
he
had
planned
this
ride
that
he
might
talk
to
me
unreservedly
and
without
fear
of
interruption
but
i
soon
saw
that
he
had
some
very
different
object
in
view
for
not
only
did
he
start
down
town
instead
of
up
but
his
conversation
such
as
it
was
confined
itself
to
generalities
and
studiously
avoided
the
one
topic
of
supreme
interest
to
us
both
at
last
as
we
turned
into
bleecker
street
i
let
my
astonishment
and
perplexity
appear
where
are
we
bound
i
asked
it
can
not
be
that
you
are
taking
me
to
see
durand
no
said
he
and
said
no
more
ah
police
headquarters
i
faltered
as
the
carriage
made
another
turn
and
drew
up
before
a
building
i
had
reason
to
remember
uncle
what
am
i
to
do
here
see
a
friend
he
answered
as
he
helped
me
to
alight
then
as
i
followed
him
in
some
bewilderment
he
whispered
in
my
ear
inspector
dalzell
he
wants
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
oh
the
weight
which
fell
from
my
shoulders
at
these
words
i
was
to
hear
then
what
had
intervened
between
me
and
my
purpose
the
wearing
night
i
had
anticipated
was
to
be
lightened
with
some
small
spark
of
knowledge
i
had
confidence
enough
in
the
inspector
to
be
sure
of
that
i
caught
at
my
uncle
s
arm
and
squeezed
it
delightedly
quite
oblivious
of
the
curious
glances
i
must
have
received
from
the
various
officials
we
passed
on
our
way
to
the
inspector
s
office
we
found
him
waiting
for
us
and
i
experienced
such
pleasure
at
sight
of
his
kind
and
earnest
face
that
i
hardly
noticed
uncle
s
sly
retreat
till
the
door
closed
behind
him
oh
inspector
what
has
happened
i
impetuously
exclaimed
in
answer
to
his
greeting
something
that
will
help
durand
without
disturbing
grey
have
you
as
good
news
for
me
as
that
hardly
he
answered
moving
up
a
chair
and
seating
me
in
it
with
a
fatherly
air
which
under
the
circumstances
was
more
discouraging
than
consolatory
we
have
simply
heard
of
a
new
witness
or
rather
a
fact
has
come
to
light
which
has
turned
our
inquiries
into
a
new
and
and
you
can
not
tell
me
what
this
fact
is
i
faltered
as
he
showed
no
intention
of
adding
anything
to
this
very
unsatisfactory
explanation
i
should
not
but
you
were
willing
to
do
so
much
for
us
i
must
set
aside
my
principles
a
little
and
do
something
for
you
after
all
it
is
only
forestalling
the
reporters
by
a
day
miss
van
arsdale
this
is
the
story
yesterday
morning
a
man
was
shown
into
this
room
and
said
that
he
had
information
to
give
which
might
possibly
prove
to
have
some
bearing
on
the
fairbrother
case
i
had
seen
the
man
before
and
recognized
him
at
the
first
glance
as
one
of
the
witnesses
who
made
the
inquest
unnecessarily
tedious
do
you
remember
jones
the
caterer
who
had
only
two
or
three
facts
to
give
and
yet
who
used
up
the
whole
afternoon
in
trying
to
state
those
facts
i
do
indeed
i
answered
well
he
was
the
man
and
i
own
that
i
was
none
too
delighted
to
see
him
but
he
was
more
at
his
ease
with
me
than
i
expected
and
i
soon
learned
what
he
had
to
tell
it
was
this
one
of
his
men
had
suddenly
left
him
one
of
his
very
best
men
one
of
those
who
had
been
with
him
in
the
capacity
of
waiter
at
the
ramsdell
ball
it
was
not
uncommon
for
his
men
to
leave
him
but
they
usually
gave
notice
this
man
gave
no
notice
he
simply
did
not
show
up
at
the
usual
hour
this
was
a
week
or
two
ago
jones
having
a
liking
for
the
man
who
was
an
excellent
waiter
sent
a
messenger
to
his
to
see
if
he
were
ill
but
he
had
left
his
lodgings
with
as
little
ceremony
as
he
had
left
the
caterer
this
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
ended
the
business
but
there
being
some
great
function
in
prospect
jones
did
not
feel
like
losing
so
good
a
man
without
making
an
effort
to
recover
him
so
he
looked
up
his
references
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
some
clue
to
his
present
whereabouts
he
kept
all
such
matters
in
a
special
book
and
expected
to
have
no
trouble
in
finding
the
man
s
name
james
wellgood
or
that
of
his
former
employer
but
when
he
came
to
consult
this
book
he
was
astonished
to
find
that
nothing
was
recorded
against
this
man
s
name
but
the
date
of
his
first
employment
march
had
he
hired
him
without
a
recommendation
he
would
not
be
likely
to
yet
the
page
was
clear
of
all
reference
only
the
name
and
the
date
but
the
date
you
have
already
noted
its
significance
and
later
he
did
too
the
day
of
the
ramsdell
ball
the
day
of
the
great
murder
as
he
recalled
the
incidents
of
that
day
he
understood
why
the
record
of
wellgood
s
name
was
unaccompanied
by
the
usual
reference
it
had
been
a
difficult
day
all
round
the
function
was
an
important
one
and
the
weather
bad
there
was
besides
an
unusual
shortage
in
his
number
of
assistants
two
men
had
that
very
morning
been
laid
up
with
sickness
and
when
this
wellgood
presented
himself
for
immediate
employment
he
took
him
out
of
hand
with
the
merest
glance
at
what
looked
like
a
very
satisfactory
reference
later
he
had
intended
to
look
up
this
reference
which
he
had
been
careful
to
preserve
by
sticking
it
along
with
other
papers
on
his
but
in
the
distractions
following
the
untoward
events
of
the
evening
he
had
neglected
to
do
so
feeling
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
man
s
work
and
general
behavior
now
it
was
a
different
thing
the
man
had
left
him
summarily
and
he
felt
impelled
to
hunt
up
the
person
who
had
recommended
him
and
see
whether
this
was
the
first
time
that
wellgood
had
repaid
good
treatment
with
bad
running
through
the
papers
with
which
his
file
was
now
full
he
found
that
the
one
he
sought
was
not
there
this
roused
him
in
good
earnest
for
he
was
certain
that
he
had
not
removed
it
himself
and
there
was
no
one
else
who
had
the
right
to
do
so
he
suspected
the
culprit
a
young
lad
who
occasionally
had
access
to
his
desk
but
this
boy
was
no
longer
in
the
office
he
had
dismissed
him
for
some
petty
fault
the
previous
week
and
it
took
him
several
days
to
find
him
again
meantime
his
anger
grew
and
when
he
finally
came
face
to
face
with
the
lad
he
accused
him
of
the
suspected
trick
with
so
much
vehemence
that
the
inevitable
happened
and
the
boy
confessed
this
is
what
he
acknowledged
he
had
taken
the
reference
off
the
file
but
only
to
give
it
to
wellgood
himself
who
had
offered
him
money
for
it
when
asked
how
much
money
the
boy
admitted
that
the
sum
was
ten
dollars
an
extraordinary
amount
from
a
poor
man
for
so
simple
a
service
if
the
man
merely
wished
to
secure
his
reference
for
future
use
so
extraordinary
that
jones
grew
more
and
more
pertinent
in
his
inquiries
eliciting
finally
what
he
surely
could
not
have
hoped
for
in
the
beginning
the
exact
address
of
the
party
referred
to
in
the
paper
he
had
stolen
and
which
for
some
reason
the
boy
remembered
it
was
an
uptown
address
and
as
soon
as
the
caterer
could
leave
his
business
he
took
the
elevated
and
proceeded
to
the
specified
street
and
number
miss
van
arsdale
a
surprise
awaited
him
and
awaited
us
when
he
told
the
result
of
his
search
the
name
attached
to
the
recommendation
had
been
hiram
sears
he
did
not
know
of
any
such
man
perhaps
you
do
but
when
he
reached
the
house
from
which
the
recommendation
was
dated
he
saw
that
it
was
one
of
the
great
houses
of
new
york
though
he
could
not
at
the
instant
remember
who
lived
there
but
he
soon
found
out
the
first
told
him
miss
van
arsdale
perhaps
you
can
do
the
same
the
number
was
i
repeated
quite
aghast
why
fairbrother
himself
the
husband
of
exactly
so
and
hiram
sears
whose
name
you
may
have
heard
mentioned
at
the
inquest
though
for
a
very
good
reason
he
was
not
there
in
person
is
his
steward
and
general
oh
and
it
was
he
who
recommended
wellgood
and
did
jones
see
him
no
the
house
you
remember
is
closed
fairbrother
on
leaving
town
gave
his
servants
a
vacation
his
steward
he
took
with
him
that
is
they
started
together
but
we
hear
no
mention
made
of
him
in
our
telegrams
from
santa
fe
he
does
not
seem
to
have
followed
fairbrother
into
the
you
say
that
in
a
peculiar
way
i
remarked
because
it
has
struck
us
peculiarly
where
is
sears
now
and
why
did
he
not
go
on
with
fairbrother
when
he
left
home
with
every
apparent
intention
of
accompanying
him
to
the
placide
mine
miss
van
arsdale
we
were
impressed
with
this
fact
when
we
heard
of
fairbrother
s
lonely
trip
from
where
he
was
taken
ill
to
his
mine
outside
of
santa
fe
but
we
have
only
given
it
its
due
importance
since
hearing
what
has
come
to
us
miss
van
arsdale
continued
the
inspector
as
i
looked
up
quickly
i
am
going
to
show
great
confidence
in
you
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
our
men
have
learned
about
this
sears
as
i
have
said
before
it
is
but
forestalling
the
reporters
by
a
day
and
it
may
help
you
to
understand
why
i
sent
you
such
peremptory
orders
to
stop
when
your
whole
heart
was
fixed
on
an
attempt
by
which
you
hoped
to
right
durand
we
can
not
afford
to
disturb
so
distinguished
a
person
as
the
one
you
have
under
your
eye
while
the
least
hope
remains
of
fixing
this
crime
elsewhere
and
we
have
such
hope
this
man
this
sears
is
by
no
means
the
simple
character
one
would
expect
from
his
position
considering
the
short
time
we
have
had
it
was
only
yesterday
that
jones
found
his
way
into
this
office
we
have
unearthed
some
very
interesting
facts
in
his
regard
his
devotion
to
fairbrother
was
never
any
secret
and
we
knew
as
much
about
that
the
day
after
the
murder
as
we
do
now
but
the
feelings
with
which
he
regarded
fairbrother
well
that
is
another
thing
and
it
was
not
till
last
night
we
heard
that
the
attachment
which
bound
him
to
her
was
of
the
sort
which
takes
no
account
of
youth
or
age
fitness
or
unfitness
he
was
no
adonis
and
old
enough
we
are
told
to
be
her
father
but
for
all
that
we
have
already
found
several
persons
who
can
tell
strange
stories
of
the
persistence
with
which
his
eager
old
eyes
would
follow
her
whenever
chance
threw
them
together
during
the
time
she
remained
under
her
husband
s
roof
and
others
who
relate
with
even
more
avidity
how
after
her
removal
to
apartments
of
her
own
he
used
to
spend
hours
in
the
adjoining
park
just
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
figure
as
she
crossed
the
sidewalk
on
her
way
to
and
from
her
carriage
indeed
his
senseless
almost
senile
passion
for
this
magnificent
beauty
became
a
in
some
mouths
and
it
only
escaped
being
mentioned
at
the
inquest
from
respect
to
fairbrother
who
had
never
recognized
this
weakness
in
his
steward
and
from
its
lack
of
visible
connection
with
her
horrible
death
and
the
stealing
of
her
great
jewel
nevertheless
we
have
a
witness
now
it
is
astonishing
how
many
witnesses
we
can
scare
up
by
a
little
effort
who
never
thought
of
coming
forward
themselves
who
can
swear
to
having
seen
him
one
night
shaking
his
fist
at
her
retreating
figure
as
she
stepped
haughtily
by
him
into
her
apartment
house
this
witness
is
sure
that
the
man
he
saw
thus
gesticulating
was
sears
and
he
is
sure
the
woman
was
fairbrother
the
only
thing
he
is
not
sure
of
is
how
his
own
wife
will
feel
when
she
hears
that
he
was
in
that
particular
neighborhood
on
that
particular
evening
when
he
was
evidently
supposed
to
be
somewhere
and
the
inspector
laughed
is
the
steward
s
disposition
a
bad
i
asked
that
this
display
of
feeling
should
impress
you
so
much
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
about
that
yet
opinions
differ
on
this
point
his
friends
speak
of
him
as
the
mildest
kind
of
a
man
who
without
native
executive
skill
could
not
manage
the
great
household
he
has
in
charge
his
enemies
and
we
have
unearthed
a
few
say
on
the
contrary
that
they
have
never
had
any
confidence
in
his
quiet
ways
that
these
were
not
in
keeping
with
the
fact
or
his
having
been
a
california
miner
in
the
early
fifties
you
can
see
i
am
putting
you
very
nearly
where
we
are
ourselves
nor
do
i
see
why
i
should
not
add
that
this
passion
of
the
seemingly
subdued
but
really
steward
for
a
woman
who
never
showed
him
anything
but
what
he
might
call
an
insulting
indifference
struck
us
as
a
clue
to
be
worked
up
especially
after
we
received
this
answer
to
a
telegram
we
sent
late
last
night
to
the
nurse
who
is
caring
for
fairbrother
in
new
he
handed
me
a
small
yellow
slip
and
i
read
the
steward
left
fairbrother
at
el
moro
he
has
not
heard
from
him
since
annetta
la
serra
for
abner
at
el
moro
i
cried
why
that
was
long
enough
for
him
to
have
reached
new
york
before
the
murder
exactly
so
if
he
took
advantage
of
every
close
xiv
trapped
i
caught
my
breath
sharply
i
did
not
say
anything
i
felt
that
i
did
not
understand
the
inspector
sufficiently
yet
to
speak
he
seemed
to
be
pleased
with
my
reticence
at
all
events
his
manner
grew
even
kinder
as
he
said
this
sears
is
a
witness
we
must
have
he
is
being
looked
for
now
high
and
low
and
we
hope
to
get
some
clue
to
his
whereabouts
before
night
that
is
if
he
is
in
this
city
meanwhile
we
are
all
glad
i
am
sure
you
are
also
to
spare
so
distinguished
a
gentleman
as
grey
the
slightest
and
durand
what
of
him
in
this
interim
he
will
have
to
await
developments
i
see
no
other
way
my
it
was
kindly
said
but
my
head
drooped
this
waiting
was
what
was
killing
him
and
killing
me
the
inspector
saw
and
gently
patted
my
hand
come
said
he
you
have
head
enough
to
see
that
it
is
never
wise
to
force
then
possibly
with
an
intention
of
rousing
me
he
remarked
there
is
another
small
fact
which
may
interest
you
it
concerns
the
waiter
wellgood
recommended
as
you
will
remember
by
this
sears
in
my
talk
with
jones
it
leaked
out
as
a
matter
of
small
moment
and
so
it
was
to
him
that
this
wellgood
was
the
waiter
who
ran
and
picked
up
the
diamond
after
it
fell
from
grey
s
ah
this
may
mean
nothing
it
meant
nothing
to
jones
but
i
inform
you
of
it
because
there
is
a
question
i
want
to
put
to
you
in
this
connection
you
did
i
i
meekly
answered
i
do
not
know
this
was
not
true
i
had
been
waiting
to
see
why
the
inspector
had
so
honored
me
with
all
these
disclosures
almost
with
his
thoughts
now
i
saw
he
desired
something
in
return
you
were
on
the
scene
at
this
very
moment
he
proceeded
after
a
brief
contemplation
of
my
face
and
you
must
have
seen
this
man
when
he
lifted
the
jewel
and
handed
it
back
to
grey
did
you
remark
his
features
no
sir
i
was
too
far
off
besides
my
eyes
were
on
that
is
a
pity
i
was
in
hopes
you
could
satisfy
me
on
a
very
important
what
point
is
that
inspector
dalzell
whether
he
answered
the
following
and
taking
up
another
paper
he
was
about
to
read
it
aloud
to
me
when
an
interruption
occurred
a
man
showed
himself
at
the
door
whom
the
inspector
no
sooner
recognized
than
he
seemed
to
forget
me
in
his
eagerness
to
interrogate
him
perhaps
the
appearance
of
the
latter
had
something
to
do
with
it
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
running
or
had
been
the
victim
of
some
extraordinary
adventure
at
all
events
the
inspector
arose
as
he
entered
and
was
about
to
question
him
when
he
remembered
me
and
casting
about
for
some
means
of
ridding
himself
of
my
presence
without
injury
to
my
feelings
he
suddenly
pushed
open
the
door
of
an
adjoining
room
and
requested
me
to
step
inside
while
he
talked
a
moment
with
this
man
of
course
i
went
but
i
cast
him
an
appealing
look
as
i
did
so
it
evidently
had
its
effect
for
his
expression
changed
as
his
band
fell
on
the
doorknob
would
he
snap
the
lock
tight
and
so
shut
me
out
from
what
concerned
me
as
much
as
it
did
any
one
in
the
whole
world
or
would
he
recognize
my
anxiety
the
necessity
i
was
under
of
knowing
just
the
ground
i
was
standing
on
and
let
me
hear
what
this
man
had
to
report
i
watched
the
door
it
closed
slowly
too
slowly
to
latch
would
he
catch
it
anew
by
the
knob
no
he
left
it
thus
and
while
the
crack
was
hardly
perceptible
i
felt
confident
that
the
least
shake
of
the
floor
would
widen
it
and
give
me
the
opportunity
i
sought
but
i
did
not
have
to
wait
for
this
the
two
men
in
the
office
i
had
just
left
began
to
speak
and
to
my
unbounded
relief
were
sufficiently
intelligible
even
now
to
warrant
me
in
giving
them
my
fullest
attention
after
some
expressions
of
astonishment
on
the
part
of
the
inspector
as
to
the
plight
in
which
the
other
presented
himself
the
latter
broke
out
i
ve
just
escaped
death
i
ll
tell
you
about
that
later
what
i
want
to
tell
you
now
is
that
the
man
we
want
is
in
town
i
saw
him
last
night
or
his
shadow
which
is
the
same
thing
it
was
in
the
house
in
street
the
house
they
all
think
closed
he
came
in
with
a
key
and
wait
you
have
him
no
it
s
a
long
story
sir
tell
it
the
tone
was
dry
the
inspector
was
evidently
disappointed
don
t
blame
me
till
you
hear
said
the
other
he
is
no
common
crook
this
is
how
it
was
you
wanted
the
suspect
s
photograph
and
a
specimen
of
his
writing
i
knew
no
better
place
to
look
for
them
than
in
his
own
room
in
fairbrother
s
house
i
accordingly
got
the
necessary
warrant
and
late
last
evening
undertook
the
job
i
went
alone
i
was
always
an
egotistical
chap
more
s
the
pity
and
with
no
further
precaution
than
a
passing
explanation
to
the
officer
i
met
at
the
corner
i
hastened
up
the
block
to
the
rear
entrance
on
street
there
are
three
doors
to
the
fairbrother
house
as
you
probably
know
two
on
street
the
large
front
one
and
a
small
one
connecting
directly
with
the
turret
stairs
and
one
on
street
it
was
to
the
latter
i
had
a
key
i
do
not
think
any
one
saw
me
go
in
it
was
raining
and
such
people
as
went
by
were
more
concerned
in
keeping
their
umbrellas
properly
over
their
heads
than
in
watching
men
skulking
about
in
doorways
i
got
in
then
all
right
and
being
careful
to
close
the
door
behind
me
went
up
the
first
short
flight
of
steps
to
what
i
knew
must
be
the
main
hall
i
had
been
given
a
plan
of
the
interior
and
i
had
studied
it
more
or
less
before
starting
out
but
i
knew
that
i
should
get
lost
if
i
did
not
keep
to
the
rear
staircase
at
the
top
of
which
i
expected
to
find
the
steward
s
room
there
was
a
faint
light
in
the
house
in
spite
of
its
closed
shutters
and
shades
and
having
a
certain
dread
of
using
my
torch
knowing
my
weakness
for
pretty
things
and
how
hard
it
would
be
for
me
to
pass
so
many
fine
rooms
without
looking
in
i
made
my
way
up
stairs
with
no
other
guide
than
the
when
i
had
reached
what
i
took
to
be
the
third
floor
i
stopped
finding
it
very
dark
i
first
listened
a
natural
instinct
with
us
then
i
lit
up
and
looked
about
me
i
was
in
a
large
hall
empty
as
a
vault
and
almost
as
desolate
blank
doors
met
my
eyes
in
all
directions
with
here
and
there
an
open
passageway
i
felt
myself
in
a
maze
i
had
no
idea
which
was
the
door
i
sought
and
it
is
not
pleasant
to
turn
unaccustomed
knobs
in
a
house
at
midnight
with
the
rain
pouring
in
torrents
and
the
wind
making
pandemonium
in
a
great
chimneys
but
it
had
to
be
done
and
i
went
at
it
in
regular
order
till
i
came
to
a
little
narrow
one
opening
on
the
this
gave
me
my
bearings
sears
room
adjoined
the
staircase
there
was
no
difficulty
in
spotting
the
exact
door
now
and
merely
stopping
to
close
the
opening
i
had
made
to
this
little
staircase
i
crossed
to
this
door
and
flung
it
open
i
had
been
right
in
my
calculations
it
was
the
steward
s
room
and
i
made
at
once
for
the
and
you
found
mostly
locked
drawers
but
a
key
on
my
bunch
opened
some
of
these
and
my
knife
the
rest
here
are
the
specimens
of
his
handwriting
which
i
collected
i
doubt
if
you
will
get
much
out
of
them
i
saw
nothing
compromising
in
the
whole
room
but
then
i
hadn
t
time
to
go
through
his
trunks
and
one
of
them
looked
very
interesting
old
as
the
hills
and
you
hadn
t
time
why
hadn
t
you
time
what
happened
to
cut
it
short
well
sir
i
ll
tell
the
tone
in
which
this
was
said
roused
me
if
it
did
not
the
inspector
i
had
just
come
from
the
desk
which
had
disappointed
me
and
was
casting
a
look
about
the
room
which
was
as
bare
as
my
hand
of
everything
like
ornament
i
might
almost
say
comfort
when
i
heard
a
noise
which
was
not
that
of
swishing
rain
or
even
gusty
wind
these
had
not
been
absent
from
my
ears
for
a
moment
i
didn
t
like
that
noise
it
had
a
sneakish
sound
and
i
shut
my
light
off
in
a
hurry
after
that
i
crept
hastily
out
of
the
room
for
i
don
t
like
a
in
a
trap
it
was
darker
than
ever
now
in
the
hall
or
so
it
seemed
and
as
i
backed
away
i
came
upon
a
jog
in
the
wall
behind
which
i
crept
for
the
sound
i
had
heard
was
no
fancy
some
one
besides
myself
was
in
the
house
and
that
some
one
was
coming
up
the
little
striking
matches
as
he
approached
who
could
it
be
a
detective
from
the
district
attorney
s
office
i
hardly
thought
so
he
would
have
been
provided
with
something
better
than
matches
to
light
his
way
a
burglar
no
not
on
the
third
floor
of
a
house
as
rich
as
this
some
fellow
on
the
force
then
who
had
seen
me
come
in
and
by
some
trick
of
his
own
had
managed
to
follow
me
i
would
see
meantime
i
kept
my
place
behind
the
jog
and
watched
not
knowing
which
way
the
intruder
would
go
whoever
he
was
he
was
evidently
astonished
to
see
the
turret
door
ajar
for
he
lit
another
match
as
he
threw
it
open
and
though
i
failed
to
get
a
glimpse
of
his
figure
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
very
good
one
of
his
shadow
it
was
one
to
arouse
a
detective
s
instinct
at
once
i
did
not
say
to
myself
this
is
the
man
i
want
but
i
did
say
this
is
nobody
from
headquarters
and
i
steadied
myself
for
whatever
might
turn
up
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
the
sudden
going
out
of
the
match
which
had
made
this
shadow
visible
the
intruder
did
not
light
another
i
heard
him
move
across
the
floor
with
the
rapid
step
of
one
who
knows
his
way
well
and
the
next
minute
a
flared
up
in
the
steward
s
room
and
i
knew
that
the
man
the
whole
force
was
looking
for
had
trapped
himself
you
will
agree
that
it
was
not
my
duty
to
take
him
then
and
there
without
seeing
what
he
was
after
he
was
thought
to
be
in
the
eastern
states
or
south
or
west
and
he
was
here
but
why
here
that
is
what
i
knew
you
would
want
to
know
and
it
was
just
what
i
wanted
to
know
myself
so
i
kept
my
place
which
was
good
enough
and
just
listened
for
i
could
not
see
what
was
his
errand
what
did
he
want
in
this
empty
house
at
midnight
papers
first
and
then
clothes
i
heard
him
at
his
desk
i
heard
him
in
the
closet
and
afterward
pottering
in
the
old
trunk
i
had
been
so
anxious
to
look
into
myself
he
must
have
brought
the
key
with
him
for
it
was
no
time
before
i
heard
him
throwing
out
the
contents
in
a
wild
search
for
something
he
wanted
in
a
great
hurry
he
found
it
sooner
than
you
would
believe
and
began
throwing
the
things
back
when
something
happened
expectedly
or
unexpectedly
his
eye
fell
on
some
object
which
roused
all
his
passions
and
he
broke
into
loud
exclamations
ending
in
groans
finally
he
fell
to
kissing
this
object
with
a
fervor
suggesting
rage
and
a
rage
suggesting
tenderness
carried
to
the
point
of
agony
i
have
never
heard
the
like
my
curiosity
was
so
aroused
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
risking
everything
for
a
look
when
he
gave
a
sudden
snarl
and
cried
out
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
kiss
what
i
ve
hated
that
is
as
bad
as
to
kill
what
i
ve
those
were
the
words
i
am
sure
he
said
kiss
and
i
am
sure
he
said
this
is
very
interesting
go
on
with
your
story
why
didn
t
you
collar
him
while
he
was
in
this
mood
you
would
have
won
by
the
surprise
i
had
no
pistol
sir
and
he
had
i
heard
him
cock
it
i
thought
he
was
going
to
take
his
own
life
and
held
my
breath
for
the
report
but
nothing
like
that
was
in
his
mind
instead
he
laid
the
pistol
down
and
deliberately
tore
in
two
the
object
of
his
anger
then
with
a
smothered
curse
he
made
for
the
door
and
turret
staircase
i
was
for
following
but
not
till
i
had
seen
what
he
had
destroyed
in
such
an
excess
of
feeling
i
thought
i
knew
but
i
wanted
to
feel
sure
so
before
risking
myself
in
the
turret
i
crept
to
the
room
he
had
left
and
felt
about
on
the
floor
till
i
came
upon
a
torn
photograph
fairbrother
s
yes
have
you
not
heard
how
he
loved
her
a
foolish
passion
but
evidently
sincere
and
never
mind
comments
sweetwater
stick
to
i
will
sir
they
are
interesting
enough
after
i
had
picked
up
these
scraps
i
stole
back
to
the
turret
staircase
and
here
i
made
my
first
break
i
stumbled
in
the
darkness
and
the
man
below
heard
me
for
the
pistol
clicked
again
i
did
not
like
this
and
had
some
thoughts
of
backing
out
of
my
job
but
i
didn
t
i
merely
waited
till
i
heard
his
step
again
then
i
followed
but
very
warily
this
time
it
was
not
an
agreeable
venture
it
was
like
descending
into
a
well
with
possible
death
at
the
bottom
i
could
see
nothing
and
presently
could
hear
nothing
but
the
almost
imperceptible
sliding
of
my
own
fingers
down
the
curve
of
the
wall
which
was
all
i
had
to
guide
me
had
he
stopped
midway
and
would
my
first
intimation
of
his
presence
be
the
touch
of
cold
steel
or
the
flinging
around
me
of
two
murderous
arms
i
had
met
with
no
break
in
the
smooth
surface
of
the
wall
so
could
not
have
reached
the
second
story
when
i
should
get
there
the
question
would
be
whether
to
leave
the
staircase
and
seek
him
in
the
mazes
of
its
great
rooms
or
to
keep
on
down
to
the
parlor
floor
and
so
to
the
street
whither
he
was
possibly
bound
i
own
that
i
was
almost
tempted
to
turn
on
my
light
and
have
done
with
it
but
i
remembered
of
how
little
use
i
should
be
to
you
lying
in
this
well
of
a
stairway
with
a
bullet
in
me
and
so
i
managed
to
compose
myself
and
go
on
as
i
had
begun
next
instant
my
fingers
slipped
round
the
edge
of
an
opening
and
i
knew
that
the
moment
of
decision
had
come
realizing
that
no
one
can
move
so
softly
that
he
will
not
give
away
his
presence
in
some
way
i
paused
for
the
sound
which
i
knew
must
come
and
when
a
click
rose
from
the
depths
of
the
hall
before
me
i
plunged
into
that
hall
and
thus
into
the
house
proper
here
it
was
not
so
dark
yet
i
could
make
out
none
of
the
objects
i
now
and
then
ran
against
i
passed
a
mirror
i
hardly
know
how
i
knew
it
to
be
such
and
in
that
mirror
i
seemed
to
see
the
ghost
of
a
ghost
flit
by
and
vanish
it
was
too
much
i
muttered
a
suppressed
oath
and
plunged
forward
when
i
struck
against
a
closing
door
it
flew
open
again
and
i
rushed
in
turning
on
my
light
in
my
extreme
desperation
when
instead
of
hearing
the
sharp
report
of
a
pistol
as
i
expected
i
saw
a
second
door
fall
to
before
me
this
time
with
a
sound
like
the
snap
of
a
spring
lock
finding
that
this
was
so
and
that
all
advance
was
barred
that
way
i
wheeled
hurriedly
back
toward
the
door
by
which
i
had
entered
the
place
to
find
that
that
had
fallen
to
simultaneously
with
the
other
a
single
spring
acting
for
both
i
was
trapped
a
prisoner
in
the
strangest
sort
of
passageway
or
closet
and
as
a
speedy
look
about
presently
assured
me
a
prisoner
with
very
little
hope
of
immediate
escape
for
the
doors
were
not
only
immovable
without
even
locks
to
pick
or
panels
to
break
in
but
the
place
was
bare
of
windows
and
the
only
communication
which
it
could
be
said
to
have
with
the
outside
world
at
all
was
a
shaft
rising
from
the
ceiling
almost
to
the
top
of
the
house
whether
this
served
as
a
ventilator
or
a
means
of
lighting
up
the
hole
when
both
doors
were
shut
it
was
much
too
inaccessible
to
offer
any
apparent
way
of
escape
never
was
a
man
more
thoroughly
boxed
in
as
i
realized
how
little
chance
there
was
of
any
outside
interference
how
my
captor
even
if
he
was
seen
leaving
the
house
by
the
officer
on
duty
would
be
taken
for
myself
and
so
allowed
to
escape
i
own
that
i
felt
my
position
a
hopeless
one
but
anger
is
a
powerful
stimulant
and
i
was
mortally
angry
not
only
with
sears
but
with
myself
so
when
i
was
done
swearing
i
took
another
look
around
and
finding
that
there
was
no
getting
through
the
walls
turned
my
attention
wholly
to
the
shaft
which
would
certainly
lead
me
out
of
the
place
if
i
could
only
find
means
to
mount
it
and
how
do
you
think
i
managed
to
do
this
at
last
a
look
at
my
bedraggled
clothes
may
give
you
some
idea
i
cut
a
passage
for
myself
up
those
perpendicular
walls
as
the
boy
did
up
the
face
of
the
natural
bridge
in
virginia
do
you
remember
that
old
story
in
the
reader
it
came
to
me
like
an
inspiration
as
i
stood
looking
up
from
below
and
though
i
knew
that
i
should
have
to
work
most
of
the
way
in
perfect
darkness
i
decided
that
a
man
s
life
was
worth
some
risk
and
that
i
had
rather
fall
and
break
my
neck
while
doing
something
than
to
spend
hours
in
maddening
inactivity
only
to
face
death
at
last
from
slow
starvation
i
had
a
knife
an
exceedingly
good
knife
in
my
pocket
and
for
the
first
few
steps
i
should
have
the
light
of
my
electric
torch
the
difficulty
that
is
the
first
difficulty
was
to
reach
the
shaft
from
the
floor
where
i
stood
there
was
but
one
article
of
furniture
in
the
room
and
that
was
something
between
a
table
and
a
desk
no
chairs
and
the
desk
was
not
high
enough
to
enable
me
to
reach
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
if
i
could
turn
it
on
end
there
might
be
some
hope
but
this
did
not
look
feasible
however
i
threw
off
my
coat
and
went
at
the
thing
with
a
vengeance
and
whether
i
was
given
superhuman
power
or
whether
the
clumsy
thing
was
not
as
heavy
as
it
looked
i
did
finally
succeed
in
turning
it
on
its
end
close
under
the
opening
from
which
the
shaft
rose
the
next
thing
was
to
get
on
its
top
that
seemed
about
as
impossible
as
climbing
the
bare
wall
itself
but
presently
i
bethought
me
of
the
drawers
and
though
they
were
locked
i
did
succeed
by
the
aid
of
my
keys
to
get
enough
of
them
open
to
make
for
myself
a
very
good
pair
of
stairs
i
could
now
see
my
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
but
after
that
taking
out
my
knife
i
felt
the
edge
it
was
a
good
one
so
was
the
point
but
was
it
good
enough
to
work
holes
in
plaster
it
depended
somewhat
upon
the
plaster
had
the
masons
in
finishing
that
shaft
any
thought
of
the
poor
wretch
who
one
day
would
have
to
pit
his
life
against
the
hardness
of
the
final
covering
my
first
dig
at
it
would
tell
i
own
i
trembled
violently
at
the
prospect
of
what
that
first
test
would
mean
to
me
and
wondered
if
the
perspiration
which
i
felt
starting
at
every
pore
was
the
result
of
the
effort
i
had
been
engaged
in
or
just
plain
fear
inspector
i
do
not
intend
to
have
you
live
with
me
through
the
five
mortal
hours
which
followed
i
was
enabled
to
pierce
that
plaster
with
my
knife
and
even
to
penetrate
deep
enough
to
afford
a
place
for
the
tips
of
my
fingers
and
afterward
for
the
point
of
my
toes
digging
prying
sweating
panting
listening
first
for
a
sudden
opening
of
the
doors
beneath
then
for
some
shout
or
wicked
interference
from
above
as
i
worked
my
way
up
inch
by
inch
foot
by
foot
to
what
might
not
be
safety
after
it
was
attained
five
hours
six
then
i
struck
something
which
proved
to
be
a
window
and
when
i
realized
this
and
knew
that
with
but
one
more
effort
i
should
breathe
freely
again
i
came
as
near
falling
as
i
had
at
any
time
before
i
began
this
terrible
climb
happily
i
had
some
premonition
of
my
danger
and
threw
myself
into
a
position
which
held
me
till
the
dizzy
minute
passed
then
i
went
calmly
on
with
my
work
and
in
another
had
reached
the
window
which
fortunately
for
me
not
only
opened
inward
but
was
off
the
latch
it
was
with
a
sense
of
inexpressible
relief
that
i
clambered
through
this
window
and
for
a
brief
moment
breathed
in
the
pungent
odor
of
cedar
but
it
could
have
been
only
for
a
moment
it
was
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
before
i
found
myself
again
in
the
outer
air
the
only
way
i
can
account
for
the
lapse
of
time
is
that
the
strain
to
which
both
body
and
nerve
had
been
subjected
was
too
much
for
even
my
hardy
body
and
that
i
fell
to
the
floor
of
the
cedar
closet
and
from
a
faint
went
into
a
sleep
that
lasted
until
two
i
can
easily
account
for
the
last
hour
because
it
took
me
that
long
to
cut
the
thick
paneling
from
the
door
of
the
closet
however
i
am
here
now
sir
and
in
very
much
the
same
condition
in
which
i
left
that
house
i
thought
my
first
duty
was
to
tell
you
that
i
had
seen
hiram
sears
in
that
house
last
night
and
put
you
on
his
i
drew
a
long
breath
i
think
the
inspector
did
i
had
been
almost
rigid
from
excitement
and
i
don
t
believe
he
was
quite
free
from
it
either
but
his
voice
was
calmer
than
i
expected
when
he
finally
said
i
ll
remember
this
it
was
a
good
night
s
then
the
inspector
put
to
him
some
questions
which
seemed
to
fix
the
fact
that
sears
had
left
the
house
before
sweetwater
did
after
which
he
bade
him
send
certain
men
to
him
and
then
go
and
fix
himself
up
i
believe
he
had
forgotten
me
i
had
almost
forgotten
myself
xv
sears
or
wellgood
not
till
the
inspector
had
given
several
orders
was
i
again
summoned
into
his
presence
he
smiled
as
our
eyes
met
but
did
not
allude
any
more
than
i
did
to
what
had
just
passed
nevertheless
we
understood
each
other
when
i
was
again
seated
he
took
up
the
conversation
where
we
had
left
it
the
description
i
was
just
about
to
read
to
you
he
went
on
will
you
listen
to
it
now
gladly
said
i
it
is
wellgood
s
i
he
did
not
answer
save
by
a
curious
glance
from
under
his
brows
but
taking
the
paper
again
from
his
desk
went
on
reading
a
man
of
looking
like
one
of
sixty
medium
height
insignificant
features
head
bald
save
for
a
ring
of
scanty
dark
hair
no
beard
a
heavy
nose
long
mouth
and
sleepy
eyes
capable
of
shooting
strange
glances
nothing
distinctive
in
face
or
figure
save
the
depth
of
his
wrinkles
and
a
scarcely
observable
stoop
in
his
right
shoulder
do
you
see
wellgood
in
that
he
suddenly
asked
i
have
only
the
faintest
recollection
of
his
appearance
was
my
doubtful
reply
but
the
impression
i
get
from
this
description
is
not
exactly
the
one
i
received
of
that
waiter
in
the
momentary
glimpse
i
got
of
so
others
have
told
me
before
he
remarked
looking
very
disappointed
the
description
is
of
sears
given
me
by
a
man
who
knew
him
well
and
if
we
could
fit
the
description
of
the
one
to
that
of
the
other
we
should
have
it
easy
but
the
few
persons
who
have
seen
wellgood
differ
greatly
in
their
remembrance
of
his
features
and
even
of
his
coloring
it
is
astonishing
how
superficially
most
people
see
a
man
even
when
they
are
thrown
into
daily
contact
with
him
jones
says
the
man
s
eyes
are
gray
his
hair
a
wig
and
dark
his
nose
pudgy
and
his
face
without
much
expression
his
that
his
eyes
are
blue
his
hair
whether
wig
or
not
a
dusty
auburn
and
his
look
quick
and
piercing
a
look
which
always
made
her
afraid
his
nose
she
don
t
remember
both
agree
or
rather
all
agree
that
he
wore
no
beard
sears
did
but
a
beard
can
be
easily
taken
off
and
all
of
them
declare
that
they
would
know
him
instantly
if
they
saw
him
and
so
the
matter
stands
even
you
can
give
me
no
definite
description
one
i
mean
as
satisfactory
or
unsatisfactory
as
this
of
i
shook
my
head
like
the
others
i
felt
that
i
should
know
him
if
i
saw
him
but
i
could
go
no
further
than
that
there
seemed
to
be
so
little
that
was
distinctive
about
the
man
the
inspector
hoping
perhaps
that
all
this
would
serve
to
rouse
my
memory
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
put
the
best
face
he
could
on
the
matter
well
well
said
he
we
shall
have
to
be
patient
a
day
may
make
all
the
difference
possible
in
our
outlook
if
we
can
lay
hands
on
either
of
these
men
he
seemed
to
realize
he
had
said
a
word
too
much
for
he
instantly
changed
the
subject
by
asking
if
i
had
succeeded
in
getting
a
sample
of
miss
grey
s
writing
i
was
forced
to
say
no
that
everything
had
been
very
carefully
put
away
but
i
do
not
know
what
moment
i
may
come
upon
it
i
added
i
do
not
forget
its
importance
in
this
very
good
those
lines
handed
up
to
fairbrother
from
the
walk
outside
are
the
second
most
valuable
clue
we
i
did
not
ask
him
what
the
first
was
i
knew
it
was
the
stiletto
strange
that
no
one
has
testified
to
that
handwriting
i
remarked
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
fifty
persons
have
sent
in
samples
of
writing
which
they
think
like
it
he
observed
often
of
persons
who
never
heard
of
the
fairbrothers
we
have
been
bothered
greatly
with
the
business
you
know
little
of
the
difficulties
the
police
labor
i
know
too
much
i
sighed
he
smiled
and
patted
me
on
the
hand
go
back
to
your
patient
he
said
forget
every
other
duty
but
that
of
your
calling
until
you
get
some
definite
word
from
me
i
shall
not
keep
you
in
suspense
one
minute
longer
than
is
absolutely
he
had
risen
i
rose
too
but
i
was
not
satisfied
i
could
not
leave
the
room
with
my
ideas
i
might
say
with
my
convictions
in
such
a
turmoil
inspector
said
i
you
will
think
me
very
obstinate
but
all
you
have
told
me
about
sears
all
i
have
heard
about
him
in
fact
this
i
emphasized
does
not
convince
me
of
the
entire
folly
of
my
own
suspicions
indeed
i
am
afraid
that
if
anything
they
are
strengthened
this
steward
who
is
a
doubtful
character
i
acknowledge
may
have
had
his
reasons
for
wishing
fairbrother
s
death
may
even
have
had
a
hand
in
the
matter
but
what
evidence
have
you
to
show
that
he
himself
entered
the
alcove
struck
the
blow
or
stole
the
diamond
i
have
listened
eagerly
for
some
such
evidence
but
i
have
listened
in
i
know
he
murmured
i
know
but
it
will
come
at
least
i
think
this
should
have
reassured
me
no
doubt
and
sent
me
away
quiet
and
happy
but
something
the
tenacity
of
a
deep
conviction
possibly
kept
me
lingering
before
the
inspector
and
finally
gave
me
the
courage
to
say
i
know
i
ought
not
to
speak
another
word
that
i
am
putting
myself
at
a
disadvantage
in
doing
so
but
i
can
not
help
it
inspector
i
can
not
help
it
when
i
see
you
laying
such
stress
upon
the
few
indirect
clues
connecting
the
suspicious
sears
with
this
crime
and
ignoring
the
direct
clues
we
have
against
one
whom
we
need
not
had
i
gone
too
far
had
my
presumption
transgressed
all
bounds
and
would
he
show
a
very
natural
anger
no
he
smiled
instead
an
enigmatical
smile
no
doubt
which
i
found
it
difficult
to
understand
but
yet
a
smile
you
mean
he
suggested
that
sears
possible
connection
with
the
crime
can
not
eliminate
grey
s
very
positive
one
nor
can
the
fact
that
wellgood
s
hand
came
in
contact
with
grey
s
at
or
near
the
time
of
the
exchange
of
the
false
stone
with
the
real
make
it
any
less
evident
who
was
the
guilty
author
of
this
exchange
the
inspector
s
hand
was
on
the
but
he
dropped
it
at
this
and
surveying
me
very
quietly
said
i
thought
that
a
few
days
spent
at
the
bedside
of
miss
grey
in
the
society
of
so
renowned
and
cultured
a
gentleman
as
her
father
would
disabuse
you
of
these
damaging
i
don
t
wonder
that
you
thought
so
i
burst
out
you
would
think
so
all
the
more
if
you
knew
how
kind
he
can
be
and
what
solicitude
he
shows
for
all
about
him
but
i
can
not
get
over
the
facts
they
all
point
it
seems
to
me
straight
in
one
all
you
heard
what
was
said
in
this
room
i
saw
it
in
your
eye
how
the
man
who
surprised
the
steward
in
his
own
room
last
night
heard
him
talking
of
love
and
death
in
connection
with
fairbrother
to
kiss
what
i
hate
it
is
almost
as
bad
as
to
kill
what
i
love
he
said
something
like
yes
i
heard
that
but
did
he
mean
that
he
had
been
her
actual
slayer
could
you
convict
him
on
those
words
well
we
shall
find
out
then
as
to
wellgood
s
part
in
the
little
business
you
choose
to
consider
that
it
took
place
at
the
time
the
stone
fell
from
grey
s
hand
what
proof
have
you
that
the
substitution
you
believe
in
was
not
made
by
him
he
could
easily
have
done
it
while
crossing
the
room
to
grey
s
inspector
then
hotly
as
the
absurdity
of
the
suggestion
struck
me
with
full
force
he
do
this
a
waiter
or
as
you
think
fairbrother
s
steward
to
be
provided
with
so
an
article
as
this
counterpart
of
a
great
stone
isn
t
that
almost
as
incredible
a
supposition
as
any
i
have
myself
presumed
to
advance
possibly
but
the
affair
is
full
of
incredibilities
the
greatest
of
which
to
my
mind
is
the
persistence
with
which
you
a
enough
little
woman
persevere
in
ascribing
the
deepest
guilt
to
one
you
profess
to
admire
and
certainly
would
be
glad
to
find
innocent
of
any
complicity
with
a
great
i
felt
that
i
must
justify
myself
mr
durand
has
had
no
such
consideration
shown
him
said
i
i
know
my
child
i
know
but
the
cases
differ
wouldn
t
it
be
well
for
you
to
see
this
and
be
satisfied
with
the
turn
which
things
have
taken
without
continuing
to
insist
upon
involving
grey
in
your
suspicions
a
smile
took
off
the
edge
of
this
rebuke
yet
i
felt
it
keenly
and
only
the
confidence
i
had
in
his
fairness
as
a
man
and
public
official
enabled
me
to
say
but
i
am
talking
quite
confidentially
and
you
have
been
so
good
to
me
so
willing
to
listen
to
all
i
had
to
say
that
i
can
not
help
but
speak
my
whole
mind
it
is
my
only
safety
valve
remember
how
i
have
to
sit
in
the
presence
of
this
man
with
my
thoughts
all
choked
up
it
is
killing
me
but
i
think
i
should
go
back
content
if
you
will
listen
to
one
more
suggestion
i
have
to
make
it
is
my
say
it
i
am
nothing
if
not
he
had
spoken
the
word
indulgent
that
was
it
he
let
me
speak
probably
had
let
me
speak
from
the
first
from
pure
kindness
he
did
not
believe
one
little
bit
in
my
good
sense
or
logic
but
i
was
not
to
be
deterred
i
would
empty
my
mind
of
the
ugly
thing
that
lay
there
i
would
leave
there
no
miserable
dregs
of
doubt
to
ferment
and
work
their
evil
way
with
me
in
the
dead
watches
of
the
night
which
i
had
yet
to
face
so
i
took
him
at
his
word
i
only
want
to
ask
this
in
case
sears
is
innocent
of
the
crime
who
wrote
the
warning
and
where
did
the
assassin
get
the
stiletto
with
the
grey
arms
chased
into
its
handle
and
the
diamond
still
the
diamond
you
hint
that
he
stole
that
too
that
with
some
idea
of
its
proving
useful
to
him
on
this
gala
occasion
he
had
provided
himself
with
an
imitation
stone
setting
and
all
he
who
has
never
shown
so
far
as
we
have
heard
any
interest
in
fairbrother
s
diamond
only
in
fairbrother
herself
if
wellgood
is
sears
and
sears
the
medium
by
which
the
false
stone
was
exchanged
for
the
real
then
he
made
this
exchange
in
grey
s
interests
and
not
his
own
but
i
don
t
believe
he
had
anything
to
do
with
it
i
think
everything
goes
to
show
that
the
exchange
was
made
by
grey
a
second
daniel
muttered
the
inspector
lightly
go
on
little
lawyer
but
for
all
this
attempt
at
banter
on
his
part
i
imagined
that
i
saw
the
beginning
of
a
very
natural
anxiety
to
close
the
conversation
i
therefore
hastened
with
what
i
had
yet
to
say
cutting
my
words
short
and
almost
stammering
in
my
eagerness
remember
the
perfection
of
that
imitation
stone
a
copy
so
exact
that
it
extends
to
the
setting
that
shows
plan
forgive
me
if
i
repeat
myself
preparation
a
knowledge
of
stones
a
particular
knowledge
of
this
one
fairbrother
s
steward
may
have
had
the
knowledge
but
he
would
have
been
a
fool
to
have
used
his
knowledge
to
secure
for
himself
a
valuable
he
could
never
have
found
a
purchaser
for
in
any
market
but
a
fancier
one
who
has
his
pleasure
in
the
mere
possession
of
a
unique
and
invaluable
gem
ah
that
is
different
he
might
risk
a
crime
history
tells
us
of
here
i
paused
to
take
breath
which
gave
the
inspector
chance
to
say
in
other
words
this
is
what
you
think
the
englishman
desirous
of
covering
up
his
tracks
conceived
the
idea
of
having
this
imitation
on
hand
in
case
it
might
be
of
use
in
the
daring
and
disgraceful
undertaking
you
ascribe
to
him
recognizing
his
own
inability
to
do
this
himself
he
delegated
the
task
to
one
who
in
some
way
he
had
been
led
to
think
cherished
a
secret
grudge
against
its
present
possessor
a
man
who
had
had
some
opportunity
for
seeing
the
stone
and
studying
the
setting
the
copy
thus
procured
grey
went
to
the
ball
and
relying
on
his
own
seemingly
unassailable
position
attacked
fairbrother
in
the
alcove
and
would
have
carried
off
the
diamond
if
he
had
found
it
where
he
had
seen
it
earlier
blazing
on
her
breast
but
it
was
not
there
the
warning
received
by
her
a
warning
you
ascribe
to
his
daughter
a
fact
which
is
yet
to
be
proved
had
led
her
to
rid
herself
of
the
jewel
in
the
way
durand
describes
and
he
found
himself
burdened
with
a
dastardly
crime
and
with
nothing
to
show
for
it
later
however
to
his
intense
surprise
and
possible
satisfaction
he
saw
that
diamond
in
my
hands
and
recognizing
an
opportunity
as
he
thought
of
yet
securing
it
he
asked
to
see
it
held
it
for
an
instant
and
then
making
use
of
an
almost
incredible
expedient
for
distracting
attention
dropped
not
the
real
stone
but
the
false
one
retaining
the
real
one
in
his
hand
this
in
plain
english
as
i
take
it
is
your
present
idea
of
the
astonished
at
the
clearness
with
which
he
read
my
mind
i
answered
yes
inspector
that
is
what
was
in
my
good
then
it
is
just
as
well
that
it
is
out
your
mind
is
now
free
and
you
can
give
it
entirely
to
your
then
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
he
added
in
studying
so
intently
your
own
point
of
view
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
the
last
thing
which
grey
would
be
likely
to
do
under
those
circumstances
would
be
to
call
attention
to
the
falsity
of
the
gem
upon
whose
similarity
to
the
real
stone
he
was
depending
not
even
his
confidence
in
his
own
position
as
an
honored
and
guest
would
lead
him
to
do
not
if
he
were
a
connoisseur
i
faltered
with
the
pride
of
one
who
has
handled
the
best
gems
he
would
know
that
the
deception
would
be
soon
discovered
and
that
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
fail
to
recognize
it
for
what
it
was
when
the
was
in
his
forced
my
dear
child
forced
and
as
chimerical
as
all
the
rest
it
can
not
stand
putting
into
words
i
will
go
further
you
are
a
good
girl
and
can
bear
to
hear
the
truth
from
me
i
don
t
believe
in
your
theory
i
can
t
i
have
not
been
able
to
from
the
first
nor
have
any
of
my
men
but
if
your
ideas
are
true
and
grey
is
involved
in
this
matter
you
will
find
that
there
has
been
more
of
a
hitch
about
that
diamond
than
you
in
your
simplicity
believe
if
grey
were
in
actual
possession
of
this
valuable
he
would
show
less
care
than
you
say
he
does
so
would
he
if
it
were
in
wellgood
s
hands
with
his
consent
and
a
good
prospect
of
its
coming
to
him
in
the
near
future
but
if
it
is
in
wellgood
s
hands
without
his
consent
or
any
near
prospect
of
his
regaining
it
then
we
can
easily
understand
his
present
apprehensions
and
the
growing
uneasiness
he
true
i
murmured
if
then
the
inspector
pursued
giving
me
a
parting
glance
not
without
its
humor
probably
not
without
something
really
serious
underlying
its
humor
we
should
find
in
following
up
our
present
clue
that
grey
has
had
dealings
with
this
wellgood
or
this
sears
or
if
you
with
your
advantages
for
learning
the
fact
should
discover
that
he
shows
any
extraordinary
interest
in
either
of
them
the
matter
will
take
on
a
different
aspect
but
we
have
not
got
that
far
yet
at
present
our
task
is
to
find
one
or
the
other
of
these
men
if
we
are
lucky
we
shall
discover
that
the
waiter
and
the
steward
are
identical
in
spite
of
their
seemingly
different
appearance
a
rogue
such
as
this
sears
has
shown
himself
to
be
would
be
an
adept
at
you
are
right
i
acknowledged
he
has
certainly
the
heart
of
a
criminal
if
he
had
no
hand
in
fairbrother
s
murder
he
came
near
having
one
in
that
of
your
detective
you
know
what
i
mean
i
could
not
help
hearing
he
smiled
looked
me
steadfastly
in
the
face
for
a
moment
and
then
bowed
me
out
the
inspector
told
me
afterward
that
in
spite
of
the
cavalier
manner
with
which
he
had
treated
my
suggestions
he
spent
a
very
serious
head
to
head
with
the
district
attorney
the
result
was
the
following
order
to
sweetwater
the
detective
you
are
to
go
to
the
regis
make
yourself
solid
there
and
gradually
as
you
can
manage
it
work
yourself
into
a
position
for
knowing
all
that
goes
on
in
room
if
the
gentleman
mind
you
the
gentleman
we
care
nothing
about
the
women
should
go
out
you
are
to
follow
him
if
it
takes
you
to
we
want
to
know
his
secret
but
he
must
never
know
our
interest
in
it
and
you
are
to
be
as
silent
in
this
matter
as
if
possessed
of
neither
ear
nor
tongue
i
will
add
memory
for
if
you
find
this
secret
to
be
one
in
which
we
have
no
lawful
interest
you
are
to
forget
it
absolutely
and
for
ever
you
will
understand
why
when
you
consult
the
st
regis
but
they
expected
nothing
from
it
absolutely
nothing
xvi
doubt
i
prayed
uncle
that
we
might
be
driven
home
by
the
way
of
street
i
wanted
to
look
at
the
fairbrother
house
i
had
seen
it
many
times
but
i
felt
that
i
should
see
it
with
new
eyes
after
the
story
i
had
just
heard
in
the
inspector
s
office
that
an
adventure
of
this
nature
could
take
place
in
a
new
york
house
taxed
my
credulity
i
might
have
believed
it
of
paris
wicked
mysterious
paris
the
home
of
intrigue
and
every
redoubtable
crime
but
of
our
own
homely
commonplace
metropolis
the
house
must
be
seen
for
me
to
be
convinced
of
the
fact
related
many
of
you
know
the
building
it
is
usually
spoken
of
with
a
shrug
the
sole
reason
for
which
seems
to
be
that
there
is
no
other
just
like
it
in
the
city
i
myself
have
always
considered
it
imposing
and
majestic
but
to
the
average
man
it
is
too
suggestive
of
feudal
life
to
be
pleasing
on
this
afternoon
a
dull
depressing
one
it
looked
undeniably
heavy
as
we
approached
it
but
interesting
in
a
very
new
way
to
me
because
of
the
great
turret
at
one
angle
the
scene
of
that
midnight
descent
of
two
men
each
in
deadly
fear
of
the
other
yet
quailing
not
in
their
purpose
the
one
of
flight
the
other
of
pursuit
there
was
no
railing
in
front
of
the
house
it
may
have
seemed
an
unnecessary
safeguard
to
the
audacious
owner
consequently
the
small
door
in
the
turret
opened
directly
upon
the
street
making
entrance
and
exit
easy
enough
for
any
one
who
had
the
key
but
the
shaft
and
the
small
room
at
the
bottom
where
were
they
naturally
in
the
center
of
the
great
mass
the
room
being
without
windows
it
was
therefore
useless
to
look
for
it
and
yet
my
eye
ran
along
the
peaks
and
pinnacles
of
the
roof
searching
for
the
skylight
in
which
it
undoubtedly
ended
at
last
i
espied
it
and
my
curiosity
satisfied
on
this
score
i
let
my
eyes
run
over
the
side
and
face
of
the
building
for
an
open
window
or
a
lifted
shade
but
all
were
tightly
closed
and
gave
no
more
sign
of
life
than
did
the
door
but
i
was
not
deceived
by
this
as
we
drove
away
i
thought
how
on
the
morrow
there
would
be
a
regular
procession
passing
through
this
street
to
see
just
the
little
i
had
seen
the
detective
s
adventure
was
like
to
make
the
house
notorious
for
several
minutes
after
i
had
left
its
neighborhood
my
imagination
pictured
room
after
room
shut
up
from
the
light
of
day
but
bearing
within
them
the
impalpable
aura
of
those
two
shadows
flitting
through
them
like
the
ghosts
of
ghosts
as
the
detective
had
tellingly
put
it
the
heart
has
its
strange
surprises
through
my
whole
ride
and
the
indulgence
in
these
thoughts
i
was
conscious
of
a
great
inner
revulsion
against
all
i
had
intimated
and
even
honestly
felt
while
talking
with
the
inspector
perhaps
this
is
what
this
wise
old
official
expected
he
had
let
me
talk
and
the
inevitable
reaction
followed
i
could
now
see
only
grey
s
goodness
and
claims
to
respect
and
began
to
hate
myself
that
i
had
not
been
immediately
impressed
by
the
inspector
s
views
and
shown
myself
more
willing
to
drop
every
suspicion
against
the
august
personage
i
had
presumed
to
associate
with
crime
what
had
given
me
the
strength
to
persist
loyalty
to
my
lover
his
innocence
had
not
been
involved
indeed
every
word
uttered
in
the
inspector
s
office
had
gone
to
prove
that
he
no
longer
occupied
a
leading
place
in
police
calculations
that
their
eyes
were
turned
elsewhere
and
that
i
had
only
to
be
patient
to
see
durand
quite
cleared
in
their
minds
but
was
this
really
so
was
he
as
safe
as
that
what
if
this
new
clue
failed
what
if
they
failed
to
find
sears
or
lay
hands
on
the
doubtful
wellgood
would
durand
be
released
without
a
trial
should
we
hear
nothing
more
of
the
strange
and
to
many
the
suspicious
circumstances
which
linked
him
to
this
crime
it
would
be
expecting
too
much
from
either
police
or
official
discrimination
no
durand
would
never
be
completely
exonerated
till
the
true
culprit
was
found
and
all
explanations
made
i
had
therefore
been
simply
fighting
his
battles
when
i
pointed
out
what
i
thought
to
be
the
weak
place
in
their
present
theory
and
sore
as
i
felt
in
contemplation
of
my
seemingly
heartless
action
i
was
not
the
unimpressionable
nonentity
i
must
have
seemed
to
the
inspector
yet
my
comfort
was
small
and
the
effort
it
took
to
face
grey
and
my
young
patient
was
much
greater
than
i
had
anticipated
i
blushed
as
i
approached
to
take
my
place
at
miss
grey
s
bedside
and
had
her
father
been
as
suspicious
of
me
at
that
moment
as
i
was
of
him
i
am
sure
that
i
should
have
fared
badly
in
his
thoughts
but
he
was
not
on
the
watch
for
my
emotions
he
was
simply
relieved
to
see
me
back
i
noticed
this
immediately
also
that
something
had
occurred
during
my
absence
which
absorbed
his
thought
and
filled
him
with
anxiety
a
western
union
envelope
lay
at
his
feet
proof
that
he
had
just
received
a
telegram
this
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
not
have
occasioned
me
a
second
thought
such
a
man
being
naturally
the
recipient
of
all
sorts
of
communications
from
all
parts
of
the
world
but
at
this
crisis
with
the
worm
of
a
doubt
still
gnawing
at
my
heart
everything
that
occurred
to
him
took
on
importance
and
roused
questions
when
he
had
left
the
room
miss
grey
nestled
up
to
me
with
the
seemingly
ingenuous
remark
poor
papa
something
disturbs
him
he
will
not
tell
me
what
i
suppose
he
thinks
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
share
his
troubles
but
i
shall
be
soon
don
t
you
see
i
am
gaining
every
day
indeed
i
do
was
my
hearty
response
in
face
of
such
a
sweet
confidence
and
open
affection
doubt
vanished
and
i
was
able
to
give
all
my
thoughts
to
her
i
wish
papa
felt
as
sure
of
this
as
you
do
she
said
for
some
reason
he
does
not
seem
to
take
any
comfort
from
my
improvement
when
doctor
freligh
says
well
well
we
are
getting
on
finely
i
notice
that
he
does
not
look
less
anxious
nor
does
he
even
meet
these
encouraging
words
with
a
smile
haven
t
you
noticed
it
he
looks
as
and
troubled
about
me
now
as
he
did
the
first
day
i
was
taken
sick
why
should
he
is
it
because
he
has
lost
so
many
children
he
can
not
believe
in
his
good
fortune
at
having
the
most
insignificant
of
all
left
to
him
i
do
not
know
your
father
very
well
i
protested
and
can
not
judge
what
is
going
on
in
his
mind
but
he
must
see
that
you
are
quite
a
different
girl
from
what
you
were
a
week
ago
and
that
if
nothing
unforeseen
happens
your
recovery
will
only
be
a
matter
of
a
week
or
two
oh
how
i
love
to
hear
you
say
that
to
be
well
again
to
read
letters
she
murmured
and
to
write
them
and
i
saw
the
delicate
hand
falter
up
to
pinch
the
precious
packet
awaiting
that
happy
hour
i
did
not
like
to
discuss
her
father
with
her
so
took
this
opportunity
to
turn
the
conversation
aside
into
safer
channels
but
we
had
not
proceeded
far
before
grey
returned
and
taking
his
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
remarked
after
a
moment
s
gloomy
contemplation
of
his
daughter
s
face
you
are
better
today
the
doctor
says
i
have
just
been
telephoning
to
him
but
do
you
feel
well
enough
for
me
to
leave
you
for
a
few
days
there
is
a
man
i
must
see
must
go
to
if
you
have
no
dread
of
being
left
alone
with
your
good
nurse
and
the
doctor
s
constant
miss
grey
looked
startled
doubtless
she
found
it
difficult
to
understand
what
man
in
this
strange
country
could
interest
her
father
enough
to
induce
him
to
leave
her
while
he
was
yet
laboring
under
such
solicitude
but
a
smile
speedily
took
the
place
of
her
look
of
surprised
inquiry
and
she
affectionately
exclaimed
oh
i
haven
t
the
least
dread
in
the
world
not
now
see
i
can
hold
up
my
arms
go
papa
go
it
will
give
me
a
chance
to
surprise
you
with
my
good
looks
when
you
come
he
turned
abruptly
away
he
was
suffering
from
an
emotion
deeper
than
he
cared
to
acknowledge
but
he
gained
control
over
himself
speedily
and
coming
back
announced
with
forced
decision
i
shall
have
to
go
i
have
no
choice
promise
me
that
you
will
not
go
back
in
my
absence
that
you
will
strive
to
get
well
that
you
will
put
all
your
mind
into
striving
to
get
indeed
i
will
she
answered
a
little
frightened
by
the
feeling
he
showed
don
t
worry
so
much
i
have
more
than
one
reason
for
living
he
shook
his
head
and
went
immediately
to
make
his
preparations
for
departure
his
daughter
gave
one
sob
then
caught
me
by
the
hand
you
look
dumfounded
said
she
but
never
mind
we
shall
get
on
very
well
together
i
have
the
most
perfect
confidence
in
was
it
my
duty
to
let
the
inspector
know
that
grey
anticipated
absenting
himself
from
the
city
for
a
few
days
i
decided
that
i
would
only
be
impressing
my
own
doubts
upon
him
after
a
rebuke
which
should
have
allayed
them
yet
when
grey
came
to
take
his
departure
i
wished
that
the
inspector
might
have
been
a
witness
to
his
emotion
if
only
to
give
me
one
of
his
very
excellent
explanations
the
parting
was
more
like
that
of
one
who
sees
no
immediate
promise
of
return
than
of
a
traveler
who
intends
to
limit
his
stay
to
a
few
days
he
looked
her
in
the
eyes
and
kissed
her
a
dozen
times
each
time
with
an
air
of
heartbreak
which
was
good
neither
for
her
nor
for
himself
and
when
he
finally
tore
himself
away
it
was
to
look
back
at
her
from
the
door
with
an
expression
i
was
glad
she
did
not
see
or
it
would
certainly
have
interfered
with
the
promise
she
had
made
to
concentrate
all
her
energies
on
getting
well
what
was
at
the
root
of
his
extreme
grief
at
leaving
her
did
he
fear
the
person
he
was
going
to
meet
or
were
his
plans
such
as
involved
a
much
longer
stay
than
he
had
mentioned
did
he
even
mean
to
return
at
all
ah
that
was
the
question
did
he
intend
to
return
or
had
i
been
the
unconscious
witness
of
a
flight
xvii
sweetwater
in
a
new
role
a
few
days
later
three
men
were
closeted
in
the
district
attorney
s
office
two
of
them
were
officials
the
district
attorney
himself
and
our
old
friend
the
inspector
the
third
was
the
detective
sweetwater
chosen
by
them
to
keep
watch
on
grey
sweetwater
had
just
come
to
town
this
was
evident
from
the
gripsack
he
had
set
down
in
a
corner
on
entering
also
from
a
certain
tousled
appearance
which
bespoke
hasty
rising
and
but
few
facilities
for
proper
attention
to
his
person
these
details
counted
little
however
in
the
astonishment
created
by
his
manner
for
a
hardy
chap
he
looked
strangely
nervous
and
indisposed
so
much
so
that
after
the
first
short
greeting
the
inspector
asked
him
what
was
up
and
if
he
had
had
another
experience
he
replied
with
a
decided
no
that
it
was
not
his
adventure
which
had
upset
him
but
the
news
he
had
to
bring
here
he
glanced
at
every
door
and
window
and
then
leaning
forward
over
the
table
at
which
the
two
officials
sat
he
brought
his
head
as
nearly
to
them
as
possible
and
whispered
five
words
they
produced
a
most
unhappy
sensation
both
the
men
hardened
as
they
were
by
duties
which
soon
sap
the
sensibilities
started
and
turned
as
pale
as
the
speaker
himself
then
the
district
attorney
with
one
glance
at
the
inspector
rose
and
locked
the
door
it
was
a
prelude
to
this
tale
which
i
give
not
as
it
came
from
his
mouth
but
as
it
was
afterward
related
to
me
the
language
i
fear
is
mostly
my
own
the
detective
had
just
been
with
grey
to
the
coast
of
maine
why
there
will
presently
appear
his
task
had
been
to
follow
this
gentleman
and
follow
him
he
did
grey
was
a
very
stately
man
difficult
of
approach
and
was
absorbed
besides
by
some
overwhelming
care
but
this
fellow
was
one
in
a
thousand
and
somehow
during
the
trip
he
managed
to
do
him
some
little
service
which
drew
the
attention
of
the
great
man
to
himself
this
done
he
so
improved
his
opportunity
that
the
two
were
soon
on
the
best
of
terms
and
he
learned
that
the
englishman
was
without
a
valet
and
being
unaccustomed
to
move
about
without
one
felt
the
awkwardness
of
his
position
very
much
this
gave
sweetwater
his
cue
and
when
he
found
that
the
services
of
such
a
man
were
wanted
only
during
the
present
trip
and
for
the
handling
of
affairs
quite
apart
from
personal
tendance
upon
the
gentleman
himself
he
showed
such
an
honest
desire
to
fill
the
place
and
made
out
to
give
such
a
good
account
of
himself
that
he
found
himself
engaged
for
the
work
before
reaching
c
this
was
a
great
stroke
of
luck
he
thought
but
he
little
knew
how
big
a
stroke
or
into
what
a
series
of
adventures
it
was
going
to
lead
him
once
on
the
platform
of
the
small
station
at
which
grey
had
bidden
him
to
stop
he
noticed
two
things
the
utter
helplessness
of
the
man
in
all
practical
matters
and
his
extreme
anxiety
to
see
all
that
was
going
on
about
him
without
being
himself
seen
there
was
method
in
this
curiosity
too
much
method
women
did
not
interest
him
in
the
least
they
could
pass
and
repass
without
arousing
his
attention
but
the
moment
a
man
stepped
his
way
he
shrank
from
him
only
to
betray
the
greatest
curiosity
concerning
him
the
moment
he
felt
it
safe
to
turn
and
observe
him
all
of
which
convinced
sweetwater
that
the
englishman
s
errand
was
in
connection
with
a
man
whom
he
equally
dreaded
and
desired
to
meet
of
this
he
was
made
absolutely
certain
a
little
later
as
they
were
leaving
the
depot
with
the
rest
of
the
arrivals
grey
said
i
want
you
to
get
me
a
room
at
a
very
quiet
hotel
this
done
you
are
to
hunt
up
the
man
whose
name
you
will
find
written
in
this
paper
and
when
you
have
found
him
make
up
your
mind
how
it
will
be
possible
for
me
to
get
a
good
look
at
him
without
his
getting
any
sort
of
a
look
at
me
do
this
and
you
will
earn
a
week
s
salary
in
one
sweetwater
with
his
head
in
air
and
his
heart
on
fire
for
matters
were
looking
very
promising
indeed
took
the
paper
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
began
to
hunt
for
a
hotel
not
till
he
had
found
what
he
wished
and
installed
the
englishman
in
his
room
did
he
venture
to
open
the
precious
memorandum
and
read
the
name
he
had
been
speculating
over
for
an
hour
it
was
not
the
one
he
had
anticipated
but
it
came
near
to
it
it
was
that
of
james
wellgood
satisfied
now
that
he
had
a
ticklish
matter
to
handle
he
prepared
for
it
with
his
usual
enthusiasm
and
circumspection
sauntering
out
into
the
street
he
strolled
first
toward
the
the
train
on
which
he
had
just
come
had
been
a
and
he
calculated
that
he
would
find
half
the
town
there
his
calculation
was
a
correct
one
the
store
was
crowded
with
people
taking
his
place
in
the
line
drawn
up
before
the
window
he
awaited
his
turn
and
when
it
came
shouted
out
the
name
which
was
his
one
talisman
james
wellgood
the
man
behind
the
boxes
was
used
to
the
name
and
reached
out
a
hand
toward
a
box
unusually
well
stacked
but
stopped
there
and
gave
sweetwater
a
sharp
look
who
are
you
he
asked
a
stranger
that
young
man
put
in
volubly
looking
for
james
wellgood
i
thought
perhaps
you
could
tell
me
where
to
find
him
i
see
that
his
letters
pass
through
this
you
re
taking
up
another
man
s
time
complained
the
postmaster
he
probably
alluded
to
the
man
whose
elbow
sweetwater
felt
boring
into
his
back
ask
dick
over
there
he
knows
the
detective
was
glad
enough
to
escape
and
ask
dick
but
he
was
better
pleased
yet
when
dick
a
fellow
with
a
squint
whose
hand
was
always
in
the
sugar
told
him
that
wellgood
would
probably
be
in
for
his
mail
in
a
few
moments
that
is
his
buggy
standing
before
the
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
so
he
had
netted
jones
quondam
waiter
at
the
first
cast
lucky
was
what
he
said
to
himself
still
lucky
sauntering
to
the
door
he
watched
for
the
owner
of
that
buggy
he
had
learned
as
such
fellows
do
that
there
was
a
secret
hue
and
cry
after
this
very
man
by
the
new
york
police
that
he
was
supposed
by
some
to
be
sears
himself
in
this
way
he
would
soon
be
looking
upon
the
very
man
whose
steps
he
had
followed
through
the
fairbrother
house
a
few
nights
before
and
through
whose
resolute
action
he
had
very
nearly
run
the
risk
of
a
lingering
death
from
starvation
a
dangerous
customer
thought
he
i
wonder
if
my
instinct
will
go
so
far
as
to
make
me
recognize
his
presence
i
shouldn
t
wonder
it
has
served
me
almost
as
well
as
that
many
times
it
appeared
to
serve
him
now
for
when
the
man
finally
showed
himself
on
the
separating
the
two
buildings
he
experienced
a
sudden
indecision
not
unlike
that
of
dread
and
there
being
nothing
in
the
man
s
appearance
to
warrant
apprehension
he
took
it
for
the
instinctive
recognition
it
undoubtedly
was
he
therefore
watched
him
narrowly
and
succeeded
in
getting
one
glance
from
his
eye
it
was
enough
the
man
was
commonplace
commonplace
in
feature
dress
and
manner
but
his
eye
gave
him
away
there
was
nothing
commonplace
in
that
it
was
an
eye
to
beware
of
he
had
taken
in
sweetwater
as
he
passed
but
sweetwater
was
of
a
commonplace
type
too
and
woke
no
corresponding
dread
in
the
other
s
mind
for
he
went
whistling
into
the
store
from
which
he
presently
reissued
with
a
bundle
of
mail
in
his
hand
the
detective
s
first
instinct
was
to
take
him
into
custody
as
a
suspect
much
wanted
by
the
new
york
police
but
reason
assured
him
that
he
not
only
had
no
warrant
for
this
but
that
he
would
better
serve
the
ends
of
justice
by
following
out
his
present
task
of
bringing
this
man
and
the
englishman
together
and
watching
the
result
but
how
with
the
conditions
laid
on
him
by
grey
was
this
to
be
done
he
knew
nothing
of
the
man
s
circumstances
or
of
his
position
in
the
town
how
then
go
to
work
to
secure
his
cooperation
in
a
scheme
possibly
as
mysterious
to
him
as
it
was
to
himself
he
could
stop
this
stranger
in
with
some
plausible
excuse
but
it
did
not
follow
that
he
would
succeed
in
luring
him
to
the
hotel
where
grey
could
see
him
wellgood
or
as
he
believed
sears
knew
too
much
of
life
to
be
beguiled
by
any
open
and
sweetwater
was
obliged
to
see
him
drive
off
without
having
made
the
least
advance
in
the
purpose
engrossing
him
but
that
was
nothing
he
had
all
the
evening
before
him
and
reentering
the
store
he
took
up
his
stand
near
the
sugar
barrel
he
had
perceived
that
in
the
pauses
of
weighing
and
tasting
dick
talked
if
he
were
guided
with
suitable
discretion
why
should
he
not
talk
of
wellgood
he
was
guided
and
he
did
talk
and
to
some
effect
that
is
he
gave
information
of
the
man
which
surprised
sweetwater
if
in
the
past
and
in
new
york
he
had
been
known
as
a
waiter
or
should
i
say
steward
he
was
known
here
as
a
manufacturer
of
patent
medicine
designed
to
rejuvenate
the
human
race
he
had
not
been
long
in
town
and
was
somewhat
of
a
stranger
yet
but
he
wouldn
t
be
so
long
he
was
going
to
make
things
hum
he
was
money
for
this
money
for
that
a
horse
where
another
man
would
walk
and
mail
well
that
alone
would
make
this
worth
while
then
the
drugs
ordered
by
wholesale
those
boxes
over
there
were
his
ready
to
be
carted
out
to
his
manufactory
count
them
some
one
and
think
of
the
bottles
and
bottles
of
stuff
they
stand
for
if
it
sells
as
he
says
it
will
then
he
will
soon
be
rich
and
so
on
till
sweetwater
brought
the
garrulous
dick
to
a
standstill
by
asking
whether
wellgood
had
been
away
for
any
purpose
since
he
first
came
to
town
he
received
the
reply
that
he
had
just
come
home
from
new
york
where
he
had
been
for
some
articles
needed
in
his
manufactory
sweetwater
felt
all
his
convictions
confirmed
and
ended
the
colloquy
with
the
final
question
and
where
is
his
manufactory
might
be
worth
visiting
the
other
made
a
gesture
said
something
about
northwest
and
rushed
to
help
a
customer
sweetwater
took
the
opportunity
to
slide
away
more
explicit
directions
could
easily
be
got
elsewhere
and
he
felt
anxious
to
return
to
grey
and
discover
if
possible
whether
it
would
prove
as
much
a
matter
of
surprise
to
him
as
to
sweetwater
himself
that
the
man
who
answered
to
the
name
of
wellgood
was
the
owner
of
a
manufactory
and
a
barrel
or
two
of
drugs
out
of
which
he
proposed
to
make
a
compound
that
would
rob
the
doctors
of
their
business
and
make
himself
and
this
little
village
rich
sweetwater
made
only
one
stop
on
his
way
to
grey
s
hotel
rooms
and
that
was
at
the
stables
here
he
learned
whatever
else
there
was
to
know
and
armed
with
definite
information
he
appeared
before
grey
who
to
his
astonishment
was
dining
in
his
own
room
he
had
dismissed
the
waiter
and
was
rather
brooding
than
eating
he
looked
up
eagerly
however
when
sweetwater
entered
and
asked
what
news
the
detective
with
some
semblance
of
respect
answered
that
he
had
seen
wellgood
but
that
he
had
been
unable
to
detain
him
or
bring
him
within
his
employer
s
observation
he
is
a
man
he
then
explained
and
manufactures
his
own
concoctions
in
a
house
he
has
rented
here
on
a
lonely
road
some
out
of
wellgood
does
the
man
named
wellgood
grey
exclaimed
with
all
the
astonishment
the
other
secretly
expected
yes
wellgood
james
wellgood
there
is
no
other
in
how
long
has
this
man
been
here
the
statesman
inquired
after
a
moment
of
apparently
great
discomfiture
just
hours
this
time
he
was
here
once
before
when
he
rented
the
house
and
made
all
his
ah
grey
rose
precipitately
his
manner
had
changed
i
must
see
him
what
you
tell
me
makes
it
all
the
more
necessary
for
me
to
see
him
how
can
you
bring
it
about
without
his
seeing
you
sweetwater
asked
yes
yes
certainly
without
his
seeing
me
couldn
t
you
rap
him
up
at
his
own
door
and
hold
him
in
talk
a
minute
while
i
looked
on
from
the
carriage
or
whatever
vehicle
we
can
get
to
carry
us
there
the
least
glimpse
of
his
face
would
satisfy
me
that
is
i
ll
try
said
sweetwater
not
very
sanguine
as
to
the
probable
result
of
this
effort
returning
to
the
stables
he
ordered
the
team
with
the
last
ray
of
the
sun
they
set
out
the
reins
in
sweetwater
s
hands
they
headed
for
the
xviii
the
closed
door
the
road
was
once
the
highway
but
the
tide
having
played
so
many
tricks
with
its
numberless
bridges
a
new
one
had
been
built
farther
up
the
cliff
carrying
with
it
the
life
and
business
of
the
small
town
many
old
landmarks
still
remained
shops
warehouses
and
even
a
few
scattered
dwellings
but
most
of
these
were
deserted
and
those
that
were
still
in
use
showed
such
neglect
that
it
was
very
evident
the
whole
region
would
soon
be
given
up
to
the
encroaching
sea
and
such
interests
as
are
inseparable
from
it
the
hour
was
that
mysterious
one
of
late
twilight
when
outlines
lose
their
distinctness
and
sea
and
shore
melt
into
one
mass
of
uniform
gray
there
was
no
wind
and
the
waves
came
in
with
a
soft
plash
but
so
near
to
the
level
of
the
road
that
it
was
evident
even
to
these
strangers
that
the
tide
was
at
its
height
and
would
presently
begin
to
ebb
soon
they
had
passed
the
last
forsaken
dwelling
and
the
town
proper
lay
behind
them
sand
and
a
few
rocks
were
all
that
lay
between
them
now
and
the
open
stretch
of
the
ocean
which
at
this
point
approached
the
land
in
a
small
bay
on
either
side
by
embracing
rocky
heads
this
was
what
made
the
harbor
at
c
it
was
very
still
they
passed
one
team
and
only
one
sweetwater
looked
very
sharply
at
this
team
and
at
its
driver
but
saw
nothing
to
arouse
suspicion
they
were
now
a
from
c
and
seemingly
in
a
perfectly
desolate
region
a
manufactory
here
exclaimed
grey
it
was
the
first
word
he
had
uttered
since
starting
not
far
from
here
was
sweetwater
s
equally
laconic
reply
and
the
road
taking
a
turn
almost
at
the
moment
of
his
speaking
he
leaned
forward
and
pointed
out
a
building
standing
on
the
side
of
the
road
with
its
feet
in
the
water
that
s
said
he
they
described
it
well
enough
for
me
to
know
it
when
i
see
it
looks
like
a
robber
s
hole
at
this
time
of
night
he
laughed
but
what
can
you
expect
from
a
manufactory
of
patent
medicine
grey
was
silent
he
was
looking
very
earnestly
at
the
building
it
is
larger
than
i
expected
he
remarked
at
last
sweetwater
himself
was
surprised
but
as
they
advanced
and
their
point
of
view
changed
they
found
it
to
be
really
an
insignificant
structure
and
wellgood
s
portion
of
it
more
insignificant
still
in
reality
it
was
a
collection
of
three
stores
under
one
roof
two
of
them
were
shut
up
and
evidently
unoccupied
the
third
showed
a
lighted
window
this
was
the
manufactory
it
occupied
the
middle
place
and
presented
a
tolerably
decent
appearance
it
showed
besides
the
lighted
lamp
i
have
mentioned
such
signs
of
life
as
a
few
tumbled
out
on
the
small
platform
in
front
and
a
whinnying
horse
attached
to
an
empty
buggy
tied
to
a
post
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
i
m
glad
to
see
the
lamp
muttered
sweetwater
now
what
shall
we
do
is
it
light
enough
for
you
to
see
his
face
if
i
can
manage
to
bring
him
to
the
door
grey
seemed
startled
it
s
darker
than
i
thought
said
he
but
call
the
man
and
if
i
can
not
see
him
plainly
i
ll
shout
to
the
horse
to
stand
which
you
will
take
as
a
signal
to
bring
this
wellgood
nearer
but
do
not
be
surprised
if
i
ride
off
before
he
reaches
the
buggy
i
ll
come
back
again
and
take
you
up
farther
down
the
all
right
sir
answered
sweetwater
with
a
side
glance
at
the
speaker
s
inscrutable
features
it
s
a
go
and
leaping
to
the
ground
he
advanced
to
the
manufactory
door
and
knocked
loudly
no
one
appeared
he
tried
the
latch
it
lifted
but
the
door
did
not
open
it
was
fastened
from
within
strange
he
muttered
casting
a
glance
at
the
waiting
horse
and
buggy
then
at
the
lighted
window
which
was
on
the
second
floor
directly
over
his
head
guess
i
ll
sing
here
he
shouted
the
man
s
name
wellgood
i
say
wellgood
no
response
to
this
either
looks
bad
he
acknowledged
to
himself
and
taking
a
step
back
he
looked
up
at
the
window
it
was
closed
but
there
was
neither
shade
nor
curtain
to
obstruct
the
view
do
you
see
anything
he
inquired
of
grey
who
sat
with
his
eye
at
the
small
window
in
the
buggy
top
no
movement
in
the
room
above
no
shadow
at
the
window
well
it
s
confounded
strange
and
he
went
back
still
calling
wellgood
the
horse
whinnied
and
the
waves
gave
a
soft
splash
and
that
was
all
if
i
except
sweetwater
s
muttered
oath
coming
back
he
looked
again
at
the
window
then
with
a
gesture
toward
grey
turned
the
corner
of
the
building
and
began
to
edge
himself
along
its
side
in
an
endeavor
to
reach
the
rear
and
see
what
it
offered
but
he
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
he
found
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
bank
before
he
had
taken
twenty
steps
yet
the
building
projected
on
and
he
saw
why
it
had
looked
so
large
from
a
certain
point
of
the
approach
its
rear
was
built
out
on
piles
making
its
depth
even
greater
than
the
united
width
of
the
three
stores
at
low
tide
this
might
be
accessible
from
below
but
just
now
the
water
was
almost
on
a
level
with
the
top
of
the
piles
making
all
approach
impossible
save
by
boat
disgusted
with
his
failure
sweetwater
returned
to
the
front
and
finding
the
situation
unchanged
took
a
new
resolve
after
measuring
with
his
eye
the
height
of
the
first
story
he
coolly
walked
over
to
the
strange
horse
and
slipping
his
bridle
brought
it
back
and
cast
it
over
a
projection
of
the
door
by
its
aid
he
succeeded
in
climbing
up
to
the
window
which
was
the
sole
eye
to
the
interior
grey
sat
far
back
in
his
buggy
watching
every
movement
there
were
no
shades
at
the
window
as
i
have
before
said
and
once
sweetwater
s
eye
had
reached
the
level
of
the
sill
he
could
see
the
interior
without
the
least
difficulty
there
was
nobody
there
the
lamp
burned
on
a
great
table
littered
with
papers
but
the
rude
before
it
was
empty
and
so
was
the
room
he
could
see
into
every
corner
of
it
and
there
was
not
even
a
where
anybody
could
remain
concealed
sweetwater
was
still
looking
when
the
lamp
which
had
been
burning
with
considerable
smoke
flared
up
and
went
out
sweetwater
uttered
an
ejaculation
and
finding
himself
face
to
face
with
utter
darkness
slid
from
his
perch
to
the
ground
approaching
grey
for
the
second
time
he
said
i
can
not
understand
it
the
fellow
is
either
lying
low
or
he
s
gone
out
leaving
his
lamp
to
go
out
too
but
whose
is
the
horse
just
excuse
me
while
i
tie
him
up
again
it
looks
like
the
one
he
was
driving
it
is
the
one
well
he
won
t
leave
him
here
all
night
shall
we
lie
low
and
wait
for
him
to
come
and
unhitch
this
animal
or
do
you
prefer
to
return
to
the
hotel
grey
was
slow
in
answering
finally
he
said
the
man
may
suspect
our
intention
you
can
never
tell
anything
about
such
fellows
as
he
he
may
have
caught
some
unexpected
glimpse
of
me
or
simply
heard
that
i
was
in
town
if
he
s
the
man
i
think
him
he
has
reasons
for
avoiding
me
which
i
can
very
well
understand
let
us
go
back
not
to
the
hotel
i
must
see
this
adventure
through
tonight
but
far
enough
for
him
to
think
we
have
given
up
all
idea
of
routing
him
out
perhaps
that
is
all
he
is
waiting
for
you
can
steal
back
excuse
me
said
sweetwater
but
i
know
a
better
dodge
than
that
we
ll
circumvent
him
we
passed
a
on
our
way
down
here
i
ll
just
drive
you
up
procure
a
boat
and
bring
you
back
here
by
water
i
don
t
believe
that
he
will
expect
that
and
if
he
is
in
the
house
we
shall
see
him
or
his
meanwhile
he
can
escape
by
the
escape
do
you
think
he
is
planning
to
escape
the
detective
spoke
with
becoming
surprise
and
grey
answered
without
apparent
suspicion
it
is
possible
if
he
suspects
my
presence
in
the
do
you
want
to
stop
him
i
want
to
see
oh
i
remember
well
sir
we
will
drive
on
that
is
after
a
what
are
you
going
to
do
oh
nothing
you
said
you
wanted
to
see
the
man
before
he
yes
but
and
that
he
might
escape
by
the
yes
well
i
was
just
making
that
a
little
bit
impracticable
a
small
pebble
in
the
keyhole
and
why
see
now
his
horse
is
walking
off
gee
i
must
have
fastened
him
badly
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
trotted
all
the
way
to
town
but
it
can
t
be
helped
i
can
not
be
supposed
to
race
after
him
are
you
ready
now
sir
i
ll
give
another
shout
then
i
ll
get
and
once
more
the
lonely
region
about
echoed
with
the
cry
wellgood
i
say
wellgood
there
was
no
answer
and
the
young
detective
masking
for
the
nonce
as
grey
s
confidential
servant
jumped
into
the
buggy
and
turned
the
horse
s
head
toward
c
xix
the
face
the
moon
was
well
up
when
the
small
boat
in
which
our
young
detective
was
seated
with
grey
appeared
in
the
bay
approaching
the
manufactory
of
wellgood
the
light
on
the
waterside
was
not
there
all
was
dark
except
where
the
windows
reflected
the
light
of
the
moon
this
was
a
decided
disappointment
to
sweetwater
if
not
to
grey
he
had
expected
to
detect
signs
of
life
in
this
quarter
and
this
additional
proof
of
wellgood
s
absence
from
home
made
it
look
as
if
they
had
come
out
on
a
fool
s
errand
and
might
much
better
have
stuck
to
the
road
no
promise
there
came
in
a
mutter
from
his
lips
shall
i
row
in
sir
and
try
to
make
a
landing
you
may
row
nearer
i
should
like
a
closer
view
i
don
t
think
we
shall
attract
any
attention
there
are
more
boats
than
ours
on
the
sweetwater
was
startled
looking
round
he
saw
a
launch
or
some
such
small
steamer
riding
at
anchor
not
far
from
the
mouth
of
the
bay
but
that
was
not
all
between
it
and
them
was
a
rowboat
like
their
own
resting
quietly
in
the
wake
of
the
moon
i
don
t
like
so
much
company
he
muttered
something
s
brewing
something
in
which
we
may
not
want
to
take
a
very
likely
answered
grey
grimly
but
we
must
not
be
deterred
not
till
i
have
seen
the
rest
sweetwater
did
not
hear
grey
seemed
to
remember
himself
row
nearer
he
now
bade
get
under
the
shadow
of
the
rocks
if
you
can
if
the
boat
is
for
him
he
will
show
himself
yet
i
hardly
see
how
he
can
board
from
that
it
did
not
look
feasible
nevertheless
they
waited
and
watched
with
much
patience
for
several
long
minutes
the
boat
behind
them
did
not
advance
nor
was
any
movement
discernible
in
the
direction
of
the
manufactory
another
short
period
then
suddenly
a
light
flashed
from
a
window
high
up
in
the
central
gable
sparkled
for
an
instant
and
was
gone
sweetwater
took
it
for
a
signal
and
with
a
slight
motion
of
the
wrist
began
to
work
his
way
in
toward
shore
till
they
lay
almost
at
the
edge
of
the
piles
hark
it
was
sweetwater
who
spoke
both
listened
grey
with
his
head
turned
toward
the
launch
and
sweetwater
with
his
eye
on
the
cavernous
space
sharply
outlined
by
the
piles
which
the
falling
tide
now
disclosed
under
each
contiguous
building
goods
had
been
directly
shipped
from
these
stores
in
the
old
days
this
he
had
learned
in
the
village
how
shipped
he
had
not
been
able
to
understand
from
his
previous
survey
of
the
building
but
he
thought
he
could
see
now
at
low
tide
or
better
at
access
could
be
got
to
the
floor
of
the
extension
and
if
this
floor
held
a
trap
the
mystery
would
be
explainable
so
would
be
the
hovering
boat
the
and
yes
this
sound
overheard
of
steps
on
a
rattling
planking
i
hear
nothing
whispered
grey
from
the
other
end
the
boat
is
still
there
but
not
a
man
has
dipped
an
they
will
soon
returned
sweetwater
as
a
smothered
sound
of
clanking
iron
reached
his
ears
from
the
hollow
spaces
before
him
duck
your
head
sir
i
m
going
to
row
in
under
this
portion
of
the
grey
would
have
protested
and
with
very
good
reason
there
was
scarcely
a
space
of
three
feet
between
them
and
the
boards
overhead
but
sweetwater
had
so
immediately
suited
action
to
word
that
he
had
no
choice
they
were
now
in
utter
darkness
and
grey
s
thoughts
must
have
been
peculiar
as
he
crouched
over
the
stern
hardly
knowing
what
to
expect
or
whether
this
sudden
launch
into
darkness
was
for
the
purpose
of
flight
or
pursuit
but
enlightenment
came
soon
the
sound
of
a
man
s
tread
in
the
building
above
was
every
moment
becoming
more
perceptible
and
while
wondering
possibly
at
his
position
grey
naturally
turned
his
head
as
nearly
as
he
could
in
the
direction
of
these
sounds
and
was
staring
with
blank
eyes
into
the
darkness
when
sweetwater
leaning
toward
him
whispered
look
up
there
s
a
trap
in
a
minute
he
ll
open
it
mark
him
but
don
t
breathe
a
word
and
i
ll
get
you
out
of
this
all
grey
attempted
some
answer
but
it
was
lost
in
the
prolonged
creak
of
hinges
somewhere
over
their
heads
spaces
which
had
looked
dark
suddenly
looked
darker
hearing
was
satisfied
but
not
the
eye
a
man
s
breath
panting
with
exertion
testified
to
a
presence
but
that
man
was
working
without
a
light
in
a
room
with
shuttered
windows
and
grey
probably
felt
that
he
knew
very
little
more
than
before
when
suddenly
most
unexpectedly
to
him
at
least
a
face
started
out
of
that
overhead
darkness
a
face
so
white
with
every
feature
made
so
startlingly
distinct
by
the
strong
light
sweetwater
had
thrown
upon
it
that
it
seemed
the
only
thing
in
the
world
to
the
two
men
beneath
in
another
moment
it
had
vanished
or
rather
the
light
which
had
revealed
it
what
s
that
are
you
there
came
down
from
above
in
hoarse
and
none
too
encouraging
tones
there
was
none
to
answer
sweetwater
with
a
quick
pull
on
the
oars
had
already
shot
the
boat
out
of
its
dangerous
harbor
xx
moonlight
and
a
clue
are
you
satisfied
have
you
got
what
you
wanted
asked
sweetwater
when
they
were
well
away
from
the
shore
and
the
voice
they
had
heard
calling
at
intervals
from
the
chasm
they
had
left
yes
you
re
a
good
fellow
it
could
not
have
been
better
then
after
a
pause
too
prolonged
and
thoughtful
to
please
sweetwater
who
was
burning
with
curiosity
if
not
with
some
deeper
feeling
what
was
that
light
you
burned
a
match
sweetwater
did
not
answer
he
dared
not
how
speak
of
the
electric
torch
he
as
a
detective
carried
in
his
pocket
that
would
be
to
give
himself
away
he
therefore
let
this
question
slip
by
and
put
in
one
of
his
own
are
you
ready
to
go
back
now
sir
are
we
all
done
here
this
with
his
ear
turned
and
his
eye
bent
forward
for
the
adventure
they
had
interrupted
was
not
at
an
end
whether
their
part
in
it
was
or
not
grey
hesitated
his
glances
following
those
of
sweetwater
let
us
wait
said
he
in
a
tone
which
surprised
sweetwater
if
he
is
meditating
an
escape
i
must
speak
to
him
before
he
reaches
the
launch
at
all
hazards
he
added
after
another
moment
s
thought
all
right
sir
how
do
you
propose
his
words
were
interrupted
by
a
shrill
whistle
from
the
direction
of
the
bank
promptly
and
as
if
awaiting
this
signal
the
two
men
in
the
rowboat
before
them
dipped
their
oars
and
pulled
for
the
shore
taking
the
direction
of
the
manufactory
sweetwater
said
nothing
but
held
himself
in
readiness
grey
was
equally
silent
but
the
lines
of
his
face
seemed
to
deepen
in
the
moonlight
as
the
boat
gliding
rapidly
through
the
water
passed
them
within
a
dozen
and
slipped
into
the
opening
under
the
manufactory
building
now
row
he
cried
make
for
the
launch
we
ll
intercept
them
on
their
sweetwater
glowing
with
anticipation
bent
to
his
work
the
boat
beneath
them
gave
a
bound
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
far
out
on
the
waters
of
the
bay
they
re
coming
he
whispered
eagerly
as
he
saw
grey
looking
anxiously
back
how
much
farther
shall
i
go
just
within
hailing
distance
of
the
launch
was
grey
s
reply
sweetwater
gaging
the
distance
with
a
glance
stopped
at
the
proper
point
and
rested
on
his
oars
but
his
thoughts
did
not
rest
he
realized
that
he
was
about
to
witness
an
interview
whose
importance
he
easily
recognized
how
much
of
it
would
he
hear
what
would
be
the
upshot
and
what
was
his
full
duty
in
the
case
he
knew
that
this
man
wellgood
was
wanted
by
the
new
york
police
but
he
was
possessed
with
no
authority
to
arrest
him
even
if
he
had
the
power
something
more
than
i
bargained
for
he
inwardly
commented
but
i
wanted
excitement
and
now
i
have
got
it
if
only
i
can
keep
my
head
level
i
may
get
something
out
of
this
if
not
all
i
could
meantime
the
second
boat
was
very
nearly
on
them
he
could
mark
the
three
figures
and
pick
out
wellgood
s
head
from
among
the
rest
it
had
a
resolute
air
the
face
on
which
to
his
evident
discomfiture
the
moon
shone
wore
a
look
which
convinced
the
detective
that
this
was
no
manufacturer
nor
even
a
caterer
s
assistant
but
a
man
of
nerve
and
resources
the
same
indeed
whom
he
had
encountered
in
fairbrother
s
house
with
such
disastrous
almost
fatal
results
to
himself
the
discovery
though
an
unexpected
one
did
not
lessen
his
sense
of
the
extreme
helplessness
of
his
own
position
he
could
witness
but
he
could
not
act
follow
grey
s
orders
but
indulge
in
none
of
his
own
the
detective
must
continue
to
be
lost
in
the
valet
though
it
came
hard
and
woke
a
sense
of
shame
in
his
ambitious
breast
meanwhile
wellgood
had
seen
them
and
ordered
his
men
to
cease
rowing
give
way
there
he
shouted
we
re
for
the
launch
and
in
a
there
s
some
one
here
who
wants
to
speak
to
you
wellgood
sweetwater
called
out
as
respectfully
as
he
could
shall
i
mention
your
name
he
asked
of
grey
no
i
will
do
that
and
raising
his
voice
he
accosted
the
other
with
these
words
i
am
the
man
percival
grey
of
darlington
manor
england
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
to
you
before
you
a
change
quick
as
lightning
and
almost
as
dangerous
passed
over
the
face
sweetwater
was
watching
with
such
painful
anxiety
but
as
the
other
added
nothing
to
his
words
and
seemed
to
be
merely
waiting
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
muttered
an
order
to
his
rowers
to
proceed
in
another
moment
the
sterns
of
the
two
small
craft
swung
together
but
in
such
a
way
that
by
dint
of
a
little
skilful
manipulation
on
the
part
of
wellgood
s
men
the
latter
s
back
was
toward
the
moon
grey
leaned
toward
wellgood
and
his
face
fell
into
shadow
also
bah
thought
the
detective
i
should
have
managed
that
myself
but
if
i
can
not
see
i
shall
at
least
but
he
deceived
himself
in
this
the
two
men
spoke
in
such
low
whispers
that
only
their
intensity
was
manifest
not
a
word
came
to
sweetwater
s
ears
bah
he
thought
again
this
is
but
he
had
to
swallow
his
disappointment
and
more
for
presently
the
two
men
so
different
in
culture
station
and
appearance
came
as
it
seemed
to
an
understanding
and
wellgood
taking
his
hand
from
his
breast
fumbled
in
one
of
his
pockets
and
drew
out
something
which
he
handed
to
grey
this
made
sweetwater
start
and
peer
with
still
greater
anxiety
at
every
movement
when
to
his
surprise
both
bent
forward
each
over
his
own
knee
doing
something
so
mysterious
he
could
get
no
clue
to
its
nature
till
they
again
stretched
forth
their
hands
to
each
other
and
he
caught
the
gleam
of
paper
and
realized
that
they
were
exchanging
memoranda
or
notes
these
must
have
been
important
for
each
made
an
immediate
endeavor
to
read
his
slip
by
turning
it
toward
the
moon
s
rays
that
both
were
satisfied
was
shown
by
their
after
movements
wellgood
put
his
slip
into
his
pocket
and
without
further
word
to
grey
motioned
his
men
to
row
away
they
did
so
with
a
will
leaving
a
line
of
silver
in
their
wake
grey
on
the
contrary
gave
no
orders
he
still
held
his
slip
and
seemed
to
be
dreaming
but
his
eye
was
on
the
shore
and
he
did
not
even
turn
when
sounds
from
the
launch
denoted
that
she
was
under
way
sweetwater
looking
at
this
morsel
of
paper
with
greedy
eyes
dipped
his
oars
and
began
pulling
softly
toward
that
portion
of
the
beach
where
a
small
and
twinkling
light
defined
the
he
hoped
grey
would
speak
hoped
that
in
some
way
by
some
means
he
might
obtain
a
clue
to
his
patron
s
thoughts
but
the
english
gentleman
sat
like
an
image
and
did
not
move
till
a
slight
but
sudden
breeze
blowing
seized
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
carried
it
away
past
sweetwater
who
vainly
sought
to
catch
it
as
it
went
fluttering
by
into
the
water
ahead
where
it
shone
for
a
moment
then
softly
disappeared
sweetwater
uttered
a
cry
so
did
grey
is
it
anything
you
wanted
called
out
the
former
leaning
over
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
making
a
dive
at
the
paper
with
his
oar
yes
but
if
it
s
gone
it
s
gone
returned
the
other
with
some
feeling
careless
of
me
very
careless
but
i
was
thinking
of
he
stopped
he
was
greatly
agitated
but
he
did
not
encourage
sweetwater
in
any
further
attempts
to
recover
the
lost
memorandum
indeed
such
an
effort
would
have
been
fruitless
the
paper
was
gone
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
them
but
to
continue
their
way
as
they
did
so
it
would
have
been
hard
to
tell
in
which
breast
chagrin
mounted
higher
sweetwater
had
lost
a
clue
in
a
thousand
and
greywell
no
one
knew
what
he
had
lost
he
said
nothing
and
plainly
showed
by
his
changed
manner
that
he
was
in
haste
to
land
now
and
be
done
with
this
doubtful
adventure
when
they
reached
the
grey
left
sweetwater
to
pay
for
the
boat
and
started
at
once
for
the
hotel
the
man
in
charge
had
the
bow
of
the
boat
in
hand
preparatory
to
pulling
it
up
on
the
boards
as
sweetwater
turned
toward
him
he
caught
sight
of
the
side
of
the
boat
shining
brightly
in
the
moonlight
he
gave
a
start
and
with
a
muttered
ejaculation
darted
forward
and
picked
off
a
small
piece
of
paper
from
the
dripping
keel
it
separated
in
his
hand
and
a
part
of
it
escaped
him
but
the
rest
he
managed
to
keep
by
secreting
it
in
his
palm
where
it
still
clung
wet
and
possibly
illegible
when
he
came
upon
grey
again
in
the
hotel
office
here
s
your
pay
said
that
gentleman
giving
him
a
bill
i
am
very
glad
i
met
you
you
have
served
me
remarkably
there
was
an
anxiety
in
his
face
and
a
hurry
in
his
movements
which
struck
sweetwater
does
this
mean
that
you
are
through
with
me
asked
sweetwater
that
you
have
no
further
call
for
my
services
quite
so
said
the
gentleman
i
m
going
to
take
the
train
i
find
that
i
still
have
sweetwater
began
to
look
alive
uttering
hasty
thanks
he
rushed
away
to
his
own
room
and
turning
on
the
gas
peeled
off
the
morsel
of
paper
which
had
begun
to
dry
on
his
hand
if
it
should
prove
to
be
the
blank
end
if
the
written
part
were
the
one
which
had
floated
off
such
disappointments
had
fallen
to
his
lot
he
was
not
unused
to
them
but
he
was
destined
to
better
luck
this
time
the
written
end
had
indeed
disappeared
but
there
was
one
word
left
which
he
had
no
sooner
read
than
he
gave
a
low
cry
and
prepared
to
leave
for
new
york
on
the
same
train
as
grey
the
word
was
diamond
xxi
grizel
grizel
i
indulged
in
some
very
serious
thoughts
after
grey
s
departure
a
fact
was
borne
in
upon
me
to
which
i
had
hitherto
closed
my
prejudiced
eyes
but
which
i
could
no
longer
ignore
whatever
confusion
it
brought
or
however
it
caused
me
to
change
my
mind
on
a
subject
which
had
formed
one
of
the
strongest
bases
to
the
argument
by
which
i
had
sought
to
save
durand
miss
grey
cherished
no
such
distrust
of
her
father
as
i
in
my
ignorance
of
their
relations
had
imputed
to
her
in
the
early
hours
of
my
ministrations
this
you
have
already
seen
in
my
account
of
their
parting
whatever
his
dread
fear
or
remorse
there
was
no
evidence
that
she
felt
toward
him
anything
but
love
and
confidence
but
love
and
confidence
from
her
to
him
were
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
doubts
i
had
believed
her
to
have
expressed
in
the
note
handed
to
fairbrother
in
the
alcove
had
i
been
wrong
then
in
attributing
this
scrawl
to
her
it
began
to
look
so
though
forbidden
to
allow
her
to
speak
on
the
one
tabooed
subject
i
had
wit
enough
to
know
that
nothing
would
keep
her
from
it
if
the
fate
of
fairbrother
occupied
any
real
place
in
her
thoughts
yet
when
the
opportunity
was
given
me
one
morning
of
settling
this
fact
beyond
all
doubt
i
own
that
my
main
feeling
was
one
of
dread
i
feared
to
see
this
article
in
my
creed
destroyed
lest
i
should
lose
confidence
in
the
whole
yet
conscience
bade
me
face
the
matter
boldly
for
had
i
not
boasted
to
myself
that
my
one
desire
was
the
truth
i
allude
to
the
disposition
which
miss
grey
showed
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
to
do
a
little
surreptitious
writing
you
remember
that
a
specimen
of
her
handwriting
had
been
asked
for
by
the
inspector
and
once
had
been
earnestly
desired
by
myself
now
i
seemed
likely
to
have
it
if
i
did
not
open
my
eyes
too
widely
to
the
meaning
of
her
seemingly
chance
requests
a
little
pencil
dangled
at
the
end
of
my
would
i
let
her
see
it
let
her
hold
it
in
her
hand
for
a
minute
it
was
so
like
one
she
used
to
have
of
course
i
took
it
off
of
course
i
let
her
retain
it
a
little
while
in
her
hand
but
the
pencil
was
not
enough
a
few
minutes
later
she
asked
for
a
book
to
look
at
i
sometimes
let
her
look
at
pictures
but
the
book
bothered
her
she
would
look
at
it
later
would
i
give
her
something
to
mark
the
place
that
postal
over
there
i
gave
her
the
postal
she
put
it
in
the
book
and
i
who
understood
her
thoroughly
wondered
what
excuse
she
would
now
find
for
sending
me
into
the
other
room
she
found
one
very
soon
and
with
a
heart
i
left
her
with
that
pencil
and
postal
a
soft
laugh
from
her
lips
drew
me
back
she
was
holding
up
the
postal
see
i
have
written
a
line
to
him
oh
you
good
good
nurse
to
let
me
you
needn
t
look
so
alarmed
it
hasn
t
hurt
me
one
i
knew
that
it
had
not
knew
that
such
an
exertion
was
likely
to
be
more
beneficial
than
hurtful
to
her
or
i
should
have
found
some
excuse
for
deterring
her
i
endeavored
to
make
my
face
more
natural
as
she
seemed
to
want
me
to
take
the
postal
in
my
hand
i
drew
near
and
took
it
the
address
looks
very
shaky
she
laughed
i
think
you
will
have
to
put
it
in
an
i
looked
at
it
i
could
not
help
it
her
eye
was
on
me
and
i
could
not
even
prepare
my
mind
for
the
shock
of
seeing
it
like
or
totally
unlike
the
writing
of
the
warning
it
was
totally
unlike
so
distinctly
unlike
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
attribute
those
lines
to
her
which
according
to
durand
s
story
had
caused
fairbrother
to
take
off
her
diamond
why
why
she
cried
you
actually
look
pale
are
you
afraid
the
doctor
will
scold
us
it
hasn
t
hurt
me
nearly
so
much
as
lying
here
and
knowing
what
he
would
give
for
one
word
from
you
are
right
and
i
am
foolish
i
answered
with
all
the
spirit
left
in
me
i
should
be
glad
i
am
glad
that
you
have
written
these
words
i
will
copy
the
address
on
an
envelope
and
send
it
out
in
the
first
thank
you
she
murmured
giving
me
back
my
pencil
with
a
sly
smile
now
i
can
sleep
i
must
have
roses
in
my
cheeks
when
papa
comes
and
she
bade
fair
to
have
ruddier
roses
than
myself
for
conscience
was
working
havoc
in
my
breast
the
theory
i
had
built
up
with
such
care
the
theory
i
had
persisted
in
urging
upon
the
inspector
in
spite
of
his
rebuke
was
slowly
crumbling
to
pieces
in
my
mind
with
the
falling
of
one
of
its
main
pillars
with
the
warning
unaccounted
for
in
the
manner
i
have
stated
there
was
a
weakness
in
my
argument
which
nothing
could
make
good
how
could
i
tell
the
inspector
if
ever
i
should
be
so
happy
or
so
miserable
as
to
meet
his
eye
again
humiliated
to
the
dust
i
could
see
no
worth
now
in
any
of
the
arguments
i
had
advanced
i
flew
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
and
was
imputing
perfect
probity
to
grey
and
an
honorable
if
mysterious
reason
for
all
his
acts
when
the
door
opened
and
he
came
in
instantly
my
last
doubt
vanished
i
had
not
expected
him
to
return
so
soon
he
was
glad
to
be
back
that
i
could
see
but
there
was
no
other
gladness
in
him
i
had
looked
for
some
change
in
his
manner
and
appearance
that
is
if
he
returned
at
all
but
the
one
i
saw
was
not
a
cheerful
one
even
after
he
had
approached
his
daughter
s
bedside
and
found
her
greatly
improved
she
noticed
this
and
scrutinized
him
strangely
he
dropped
his
eyes
and
turned
to
leave
the
room
but
was
stopped
by
her
loving
cry
he
came
back
and
leaned
over
her
what
is
it
father
you
are
fatigued
worried
no
no
quite
well
he
hastily
assured
her
but
you
are
you
as
well
as
you
seem
indeed
yes
i
am
gaining
every
day
see
see
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
sit
up
yesterday
i
read
a
few
he
started
with
a
side
glance
at
me
which
took
in
a
table
near
by
on
which
a
little
book
was
lying
oh
a
book
yes
and
and
arthur
s
the
father
flushed
lifted
himself
patted
her
arm
tenderly
and
hastened
into
another
room
miss
grey
s
eyes
followed
him
longingly
and
i
heard
her
give
utterance
to
a
soft
sigh
a
few
hours
before
this
would
have
conveyed
to
my
suspicious
mind
deep
and
mysterious
meanings
but
i
was
seeing
everything
now
in
a
different
light
and
i
found
myself
no
longer
inclined
either
to
exaggerate
or
to
misinterpret
these
little
marks
of
filial
solicitude
trying
to
rejoice
over
the
present
condition
of
my
mind
i
was
searching
in
the
hidden
depths
of
my
nature
for
the
patience
of
which
i
stood
in
such
need
when
every
thought
and
feeling
were
again
thrown
into
confusion
by
the
receipt
of
another
communication
from
the
inspector
in
which
he
stated
that
something
had
occurred
to
bring
the
authorities
round
to
my
way
of
thinking
and
that
the
test
with
the
stiletto
was
to
be
made
at
once
could
the
irony
of
fate
go
further
i
dropped
the
letter
half
read
querying
if
it
were
my
duty
to
let
the
inspector
know
of
the
flaw
i
had
discovered
in
my
own
theory
before
i
proceeded
with
the
attempt
i
had
suggested
when
i
believed
in
its
complete
soundness
i
had
not
settled
the
question
when
i
took
the
letter
up
again
its
opening
sentence
i
was
caught
by
the
word
it
was
a
very
indefinite
one
yet
was
capable
of
covering
a
large
field
it
must
cover
a
large
field
or
it
could
not
have
produced
such
a
change
in
the
minds
of
these
men
conservative
from
principle
and
in
this
instance
from
discretion
i
would
be
satisfied
with
that
word
something
and
quit
further
thinking
i
was
weary
of
it
the
inspector
was
now
taking
the
initiative
and
i
was
satisfied
to
be
his
simple
instrument
and
no
more
arrived
at
this
conclusion
however
i
read
the
rest
of
the
letter
the
test
was
to
go
on
but
under
different
conditions
it
was
no
longer
to
be
made
at
my
own
discretion
and
in
the
room
it
was
to
be
made
at
luncheon
hour
and
in
grey
s
private
where
if
by
any
chance
grey
found
himself
outraged
by
the
placing
of
this
notorious
weapon
beside
his
plate
the
blame
could
be
laid
on
the
waiter
who
mistaking
his
directions
had
placed
it
on
grey
s
table
when
it
was
meant
for
inspector
dalzell
s
who
was
lunching
in
the
adjoining
room
it
was
i
however
who
was
to
do
the
placing
with
what
precautions
and
under
what
circumstances
will
presently
appear
fortunately
the
hour
set
was
very
near
otherwise
i
do
not
know
how
i
could
have
endured
the
continued
strain
of
gazing
on
my
patient
s
sweet
face
looking
up
at
me
from
her
pillow
with
a
shadow
over
its
beauty
which
had
not
been
there
before
her
father
s
return
and
that
father
i
could
hear
him
pacing
the
library
floor
with
a
restlessness
that
struck
me
as
being
strangely
akin
to
my
own
inward
anguish
of
impatience
and
doubt
what
was
he
dreading
what
was
it
i
had
seen
darkening
his
face
and
disturbing
his
manner
when
from
time
to
time
he
pushed
open
the
communicating
door
and
cast
an
anxious
glance
our
way
only
to
withdraw
again
without
uttering
a
word
did
he
realize
that
a
crisis
was
approaching
that
danger
menaced
him
and
from
me
no
not
the
latter
for
his
glance
never
strayed
to
me
but
rested
solely
on
his
daughter
i
was
therefore
not
connected
with
the
disturbance
in
his
thoughts
as
far
as
that
was
concerned
i
could
proceed
fearlessly
i
had
not
him
to
dread
only
the
event
that
i
did
dread
as
any
one
must
who
saw
miss
grey
s
face
during
these
painful
moments
and
heard
that
restless
tramp
in
the
room
beyond
at
last
the
hour
struck
the
hour
at
which
grey
always
descended
to
lunch
he
was
punctuality
itself
and
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
could
depend
upon
his
leaving
the
room
within
five
minutes
of
the
stroke
of
one
but
would
he
be
as
prompt
was
he
in
the
mood
for
luncheon
would
he
go
down
stairs
at
all
yes
for
the
tramp
tramp
stopped
i
heard
him
approaching
his
daughter
s
door
for
a
last
look
in
and
managed
to
escape
just
in
time
to
procure
what
i
wanted
and
reach
the
room
below
before
he
came
my
opportunity
was
short
but
i
had
time
to
see
two
things
first
that
the
location
of
his
seat
had
been
changed
so
that
his
back
was
to
the
door
leading
into
the
adjoining
room
secondly
that
this
door
was
ajar
the
usual
waiter
was
in
the
room
and
showed
no
surprise
at
my
appearance
i
having
been
careful
to
have
it
understood
that
hereafter
miss
grey
s
appetite
was
to
be
encouraged
by
having
her
soup
served
from
her
father
s
table
by
her
father
s
own
hands
and
that
i
should
be
there
to
receive
it
mr
grey
is
coming
said
i
approaching
the
waiter
and
handing
him
the
stiletto
loosely
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
place
this
at
his
plate
just
as
it
is
a
man
gave
it
to
me
for
grey
said
we
were
to
place
it
the
waiter
suspecting
nothing
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
i
had
hardly
time
to
catch
up
the
tray
laden
with
dishes
which
i
saw
awaiting
me
on
a
when
grey
came
in
and
was
ushered
to
his
seat
the
soup
was
not
there
but
i
advanced
with
my
tray
and
stood
waiting
not
too
near
lest
the
violent
beating
of
my
heart
should
betray
me
as
i
did
so
the
waiter
disappeared
and
the
door
behind
us
opened
though
grey
s
eye
had
fallen
on
the
package
and
i
saw
him
start
i
darted
one
glance
at
the
room
thus
disclosed
and
saw
that
it
held
two
tables
at
one
the
inspector
and
some
one
i
did
not
know
sat
eating
at
the
other
a
man
alone
whose
back
was
to
us
all
and
who
seemingly
was
entirely
disconnected
with
the
interests
of
this
tragic
moment
all
this
i
saw
in
an
instant
the
next
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
grey
s
face
he
had
reached
out
his
hand
to
the
package
and
his
features
showed
an
emotion
i
hardly
understood
what
s
this
he
murmured
feeling
it
with
wonder
i
should
almost
say
anger
suddenly
he
pulled
off
the
wrapper
and
my
heart
stood
still
in
expectancy
if
he
quailed
and
how
could
he
help
doing
so
if
guilty
what
a
doubt
would
be
removed
from
my
own
breast
what
an
impediment
from
police
action
but
he
did
not
quail
he
simply
uttered
an
exclamation
of
intense
anger
and
laid
the
weapon
back
on
the
table
without
even
taking
the
precaution
of
covering
it
up
i
think
he
muttered
an
oath
but
there
was
no
fear
in
it
not
a
particle
my
disappointment
was
so
great
my
humiliation
so
unbounded
that
forgetting
myself
in
my
dismay
i
staggered
back
and
let
the
tray
with
all
its
contents
slip
from
my
hands
the
crash
that
followed
stopped
grey
in
the
act
of
rising
but
it
did
something
more
it
awoke
a
cry
from
the
adjoining
room
which
i
shall
never
forget
while
we
both
started
and
turned
to
see
from
whom
this
grievous
sound
had
sprung
a
man
came
stumbling
toward
us
with
his
hands
before
his
eyes
and
this
name
wild
on
his
lips
grizel
grizel
fairbrother
s
name
and
the
man
xxii
guilt
was
he
wellgood
sears
who
a
lover
of
the
woman
certainly
that
was
borne
in
on
us
by
the
passion
of
his
cry
grizel
grizel
but
how
here
and
why
such
fury
in
grey
s
face
and
such
amazement
in
that
of
the
inspector
this
question
was
not
to
be
answered
offhand
grey
advancing
laid
a
finger
on
the
man
s
shoulder
come
said
he
we
will
have
our
conversation
in
another
the
man
who
in
dress
and
appearance
looked
oddly
out
of
place
in
those
gorgeous
rooms
shook
off
the
stupor
into
which
he
had
fallen
and
started
to
follow
the
englishman
a
waiter
crossed
their
track
with
the
soup
for
our
table
grey
motioned
him
aside
take
that
back
said
he
i
have
some
business
to
transact
with
this
gentleman
before
i
eat
i
ll
ring
when
i
want
then
they
entered
where
i
was
as
the
door
closed
i
caught
sight
of
the
inspector
s
face
turned
earnestly
toward
me
in
his
eyes
i
read
my
duty
and
girded
up
my
heart
as
it
were
to
meet
what
in
that
moment
it
was
impossible
to
tell
the
next
enlightened
me
with
a
total
ignoring
of
my
presence
due
probably
to
his
great
excitement
grey
turned
on
his
companion
the
moment
he
had
closed
the
door
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
cried
fairbrother
you
villain
why
have
you
called
on
your
wife
like
this
are
you
murderer
as
well
as
thief
fairbrother
this
man
then
who
was
he
who
was
being
nursed
back
to
life
on
the
mountains
beyond
santa
fe
sears
anything
seemed
possible
in
that
moment
meanwhile
dropping
his
hand
from
the
other
s
throat
as
suddenly
as
he
had
seized
it
grey
caught
up
the
stiletto
from
the
table
where
he
had
flung
it
crying
do
you
recognize
this
ah
then
i
saw
guilt
in
a
silence
worse
than
any
cry
this
husband
of
the
murdered
woman
the
man
on
whom
no
suspicion
had
fallen
the
man
whom
all
had
thought
a
thousand
miles
away
at
the
time
of
the
deed
stared
at
the
weapon
thrust
under
his
eyes
while
over
his
face
passed
all
those
expressions
of
fear
abhorrence
and
detected
guilt
which
fool
that
i
was
i
had
expected
to
see
reflected
in
response
to
the
same
test
in
grey
s
equable
countenance
the
surprise
and
wonder
of
it
held
me
chained
to
the
spot
i
was
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
so
that
i
scarcely
noted
the
broken
fragments
at
my
feet
but
the
intruder
noticed
them
wrenching
his
gaze
from
the
stiletto
which
grey
continued
to
hold
out
he
pointed
to
the
broken
cup
and
saucer
muttering
that
is
what
startled
me
into
this
betrayal
the
noise
of
breaking
china
i
can
not
bear
it
since
he
stopped
bit
his
lip
and
looked
around
him
with
an
air
of
sudden
bravado
since
you
dropped
the
cups
at
your
wife
s
feet
in
ramsdell
s
alcove
finished
grey
with
admirable
i
see
that
explanations
from
myself
are
not
in
order
was
the
grim
retort
launched
with
the
bitterest
sarcasm
then
as
the
full
weight
of
his
position
crushed
in
on
him
his
face
assumed
an
aspect
startling
to
my
unaccustomed
eyes
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
he
drew
forth
a
small
box
which
he
placed
in
grey
s
hands
the
great
mogul
he
declared
simply
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
heard
this
diamond
so
named
without
a
word
that
gentleman
opened
the
box
took
one
look
at
the
contents
assumed
a
satisfied
air
and
carefully
deposited
the
recovered
gem
in
his
own
pocket
as
his
eyes
returned
to
the
man
before
him
all
the
passion
of
the
latter
burst
forth
it
was
not
for
that
i
killed
her
cried
he
it
was
because
she
defied
me
and
flaunted
her
disobedience
in
my
very
face
i
would
do
it
again
yet
here
his
voice
broke
and
it
was
in
a
different
tone
and
with
a
total
change
of
manner
he
added
you
stand
appalled
at
my
depravity
you
have
not
lived
my
then
quickly
and
with
a
touch
of
sullenness
you
suspected
me
because
of
the
stiletto
it
was
a
mistake
using
that
stiletto
otherwise
the
plan
was
good
i
doubt
if
you
know
now
how
i
found
my
way
into
the
alcove
possibly
under
your
very
eyes
certainly
under
the
eyes
of
many
who
knew
i
do
not
it
is
enough
that
you
entered
it
that
you
confess
your
here
grey
stretched
his
hand
toward
the
electric
button
no
it
is
not
the
tone
was
fierce
authoritative
do
not
ring
the
bell
not
yet
i
have
a
fancy
to
tell
you
how
i
managed
that
little
glancing
about
he
caught
up
from
a
table
a
small
brass
tray
emptying
it
of
its
contents
he
turned
on
us
with
features
and
an
obsequious
air
so
opposed
to
his
natural
manner
that
it
was
as
if
another
man
stood
before
us
pardon
my
black
tie
he
muttered
holding
out
the
tray
toward
grey
wellgood
the
room
turned
with
me
it
was
he
then
the
great
financier
the
multimillionaire
the
husband
of
the
magnificent
grizel
who
had
entered
ramsdell
s
house
as
a
waiter
grey
did
not
show
surprise
but
he
made
a
gesture
when
instantly
the
tray
was
thrown
aside
and
the
man
resumed
his
ordinary
aspect
i
see
you
understand
me
he
cried
i
who
have
played
host
at
many
a
ball
passed
myself
off
that
night
as
one
of
the
waiters
i
came
and
went
and
no
one
noticed
me
it
is
such
a
natural
sight
to
see
a
waiter
passing
ices
that
my
going
in
and
out
of
the
alcove
did
not
attract
the
least
attention
i
never
look
at
waiters
when
i
attend
balls
i
never
look
higher
than
their
trays
no
one
looked
at
me
higher
than
my
tray
i
held
the
stiletto
under
the
tray
and
when
i
struck
her
she
threw
up
her
hands
and
they
hit
the
tray
and
the
cups
fell
i
have
never
been
able
to
bear
the
sound
of
breaking
china
since
i
loved
her
a
gasp
and
he
recovered
himself
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
he
muttered
you
summoned
me
under
threat
to
present
myself
at
your
door
i
have
done
so
i
meant
to
restore
you
your
diamond
simply
it
has
become
worthless
to
me
but
fate
exacted
more
surprise
forced
my
secret
from
me
that
young
lady
with
her
damnable
awkwardness
has
put
my
head
in
a
noose
but
do
not
think
to
hold
it
there
i
did
not
risk
this
interview
without
precautions
i
assure
you
and
when
i
leave
this
hotel
it
will
be
as
a
free
with
one
of
his
rapid
changes
wonderful
and
inexplicable
to
me
at
the
moment
he
turned
toward
me
with
a
bow
saying
courteously
enough
we
will
excuse
the
young
next
moment
the
barrel
of
a
pistol
gleamed
in
his
hand
the
moment
was
critical
grey
stood
directly
in
the
line
of
fire
and
the
audacious
man
who
thus
held
him
at
his
mercy
was
scarcely
a
foot
from
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
marking
the
desperation
of
his
look
and
the
steadiness
of
his
finger
on
the
trigger
i
expected
to
see
grey
recoil
and
the
man
escape
but
grey
held
his
own
though
he
made
no
move
and
did
not
venture
to
speak
nerved
by
his
courage
i
summoned
up
all
my
own
this
man
must
not
escape
nor
must
grey
suffer
the
pistol
directed
against
him
must
be
diverted
to
myself
such
amends
were
due
one
whose
good
name
i
had
so
deeply
if
secretly
insulted
i
had
but
to
scream
to
call
out
for
the
inspector
but
a
remembrance
of
the
necessity
we
were
now
under
of
preserving
our
secret
of
keeping
from
grey
the
fact
that
he
had
been
under
surveillance
was
even
at
that
moment
surrounded
by
the
police
deterred
me
and
i
threw
myself
toward
the
bell
instead
crying
out
that
i
would
raise
the
house
if
he
moved
and
laid
my
finger
on
the
button
the
pistol
swerved
my
way
the
face
above
it
smiled
i
watched
that
smile
before
it
broadened
to
its
full
extent
i
pressed
the
button
fairbrother
stared
dropped
his
pistol
and
burst
forth
with
these
two
words
brave
girl
the
tone
i
can
never
convey
then
he
made
for
the
door
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
knob
he
called
back
i
have
been
in
worse
straits
than
this
but
he
never
had
when
he
opened
the
door
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
inspector
xxiii
the
great
mogul
later
it
was
all
explained
grey
looking
like
another
man
came
into
the
room
where
i
was
endeavoring
to
soothe
his
startled
daughter
and
devour
in
secret
my
own
joy
taking
the
sweet
girl
in
his
arms
he
said
with
a
calm
ignoring
of
my
presence
at
which
i
secretly
smiled
this
is
the
happiest
moment
of
my
existence
helen
i
feel
as
if
i
had
recovered
you
from
the
brink
of
the
me
why
i
have
never
been
so
ill
as
i
know
but
i
have
felt
as
if
you
were
doomed
ever
since
i
heard
or
thought
i
heard
in
this
city
and
under
no
ordinary
circumstances
the
peculiar
cry
which
haunts
our
house
on
the
eve
of
any
great
misfortune
i
shall
not
apologize
for
my
fears
you
know
that
i
have
good
cause
for
them
but
only
i
have
heard
from
the
lips
of
the
most
arrant
knave
i
have
ever
known
that
this
cry
sprang
from
himself
with
intent
to
deceive
me
he
knew
my
weakness
knew
the
cry
he
was
in
darlington
manor
when
cecilia
died
and
wishing
to
startle
me
into
dropping
something
which
i
held
made
use
of
his
ventriloquial
powers
he
had
been
a
mountebank
once
poor
wretch
and
with
such
effect
that
i
have
not
been
a
happy
man
since
in
spite
of
your
daily
improvement
and
continued
promise
of
recovery
but
i
am
happy
now
relieved
and
joyful
and
this
miserable
being
would
you
like
to
hear
his
story
are
you
strong
enough
for
anything
so
tragic
he
is
a
thief
and
a
murderer
but
he
has
feelings
and
his
life
has
been
a
curious
one
and
strangely
interwoven
with
ours
do
you
care
to
hear
about
it
he
is
the
man
who
stole
our
my
patient
uttered
a
little
cry
oh
tell
me
she
entreated
excited
but
not
unhealthfully
while
i
was
in
an
anguish
of
curiosity
i
could
with
difficulty
conceal
grey
turned
with
courtesy
toward
me
and
asked
if
a
few
family
details
would
bore
me
i
smiled
and
assured
him
to
the
contrary
at
which
he
settled
himself
in
the
chair
he
liked
best
and
began
a
tale
which
i
will
permit
myself
to
present
to
you
complete
and
from
other
points
of
view
than
his
own
some
five
years
before
one
of
the
great
diamonds
of
the
world
was
offered
for
sale
in
an
eastern
market
grey
who
stopped
at
no
expense
in
the
gratification
of
his
taste
in
this
direction
immediately
sent
his
agent
to
egypt
to
examine
this
stone
if
the
agent
discovered
it
to
be
all
that
was
claimed
for
it
and
within
the
reach
of
a
wealthy
commoner
s
purse
he
was
to
buy
it
upon
inspection
it
was
found
to
be
all
that
was
claimed
with
one
exception
in
the
center
of
one
of
the
facets
was
a
flaw
but
as
this
was
considered
to
mark
the
diamond
and
rather
add
to
than
detract
from
its
value
as
a
traditional
stone
with
many
historical
associations
it
was
finally
purchased
by
grey
and
placed
among
his
treasures
in
his
in
kent
never
a
suspicious
man
he
took
delight
in
exhibiting
this
acquisition
to
such
of
his
friends
and
acquaintances
as
were
likely
to
feel
any
interest
in
it
and
it
was
not
an
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
allow
it
to
pass
from
hand
to
hand
while
he
pottered
over
his
other
treasures
and
displayed
this
and
that
to
such
as
had
no
eyes
for
the
diamond
it
was
after
one
such
occasion
that
he
found
on
taking
the
stone
in
his
hand
to
replace
it
in
the
safe
he
had
had
built
for
it
in
one
of
his
cabinets
that
it
did
not
strike
his
eye
with
its
usual
force
and
brilliancy
and
on
examining
it
closely
he
discovered
the
absence
of
the
telltale
flaw
struck
with
dismay
he
submitted
it
to
a
still
more
rigid
inspection
when
he
found
that
what
he
held
was
not
even
a
diamond
but
a
worthless
bit
of
glass
which
had
been
substituted
by
some
cunning
knave
for
his
invaluable
gem
for
the
moment
his
humiliation
almost
equaled
his
sense
of
loss
he
had
been
so
often
warned
of
the
danger
he
ran
in
letting
so
priceless
an
object
pass
around
under
all
eyes
but
his
own
his
wife
and
friends
had
prophesied
some
such
loss
as
this
not
once
but
many
times
and
he
had
always
laughed
at
their
fears
saying
that
he
knew
his
friends
and
there
was
not
a
scamp
amongst
them
but
now
he
saw
it
proved
that
even
the
intuition
of
a
man
in
human
nature
is
not
always
infallible
and
ashamed
of
his
past
laxness
and
more
ashamed
yet
of
the
doubts
which
this
experience
called
up
in
regard
to
all
his
friends
he
shut
up
the
false
stone
with
his
usual
care
and
buried
his
loss
in
his
own
bosom
till
he
could
sift
his
impressions
and
recall
with
some
degree
of
probability
the
circumstances
under
which
this
exchange
could
have
been
made
it
had
not
been
made
that
evening
of
this
he
was
positive
the
only
persons
present
on
this
occasion
were
friends
of
such
standing
and
repute
that
suspicion
in
their
regard
was
simply
monstrous
when
and
to
whom
then
had
he
shown
the
diamond
last
alas
it
had
been
a
long
month
since
he
had
shown
the
jewel
cecilia
his
youngest
daughter
had
died
in
the
interim
therefore
his
mind
had
not
been
on
jewels
a
month
time
for
his
precious
diamond
to
have
been
carried
back
to
the
east
time
for
it
to
have
been
recut
surely
it
was
lost
to
him
for
ever
unless
he
could
immediately
locate
the
person
who
had
robbed
him
of
it
but
this
promised
difficulties
he
could
not
remember
just
what
persons
he
had
entertained
on
that
especial
day
in
his
little
hall
of
cabinets
and
when
he
did
succeed
in
getting
a
list
of
them
from
his
butler
he
was
by
no
means
sure
that
it
included
the
full
number
of
his
guests
his
own
memory
was
execrable
and
in
short
he
had
but
few
facts
to
offer
to
the
discreet
agent
sent
up
from
scotland
yard
one
morning
to
hear
his
complaint
and
act
secretly
in
his
interests
he
could
give
him
carte
blanche
to
carry
on
his
inquiries
in
the
diamond
market
but
little
else
and
while
this
seemed
to
satisfy
the
agent
it
did
not
lead
to
any
gratifying
result
to
himself
and
he
had
thoroughly
made
up
his
mind
to
swallow
his
loss
and
say
nothing
about
it
when
one
day
a
young
cousin
of
his
living
in
great
style
in
an
adjoining
county
informed
him
that
in
some
mysterious
way
he
had
lost
from
his
collection
of
arms
a
unique
and
stiletto
of
italian
workmanship
startled
by
this
coincidence
grey
ventured
upon
a
question
or
two
which
led
to
his
cousin
s
confiding
to
him
the
fact
that
this
article
had
disappeared
after
a
large
supper
given
by
him
to
a
number
of
friends
and
gentlemen
from
london
this
piece
of
knowledge
still
further
coinciding
with
his
own
experience
caused
grey
to
ask
for
a
list
of
his
guests
in
the
hope
of
finding
among
them
one
who
had
been
in
his
own
house
his
cousin
quite
unsuspicious
of
the
motives
underlying
this
request
hastened
to
write
out
this
list
and
together
they
pored
over
the
names
crossing
out
such
as
were
absolutely
above
suspicion
when
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
list
but
two
names
remained
uncrossed
one
was
that
of
a
youth
who
had
come
in
the
wake
of
a
highly
reputed
connection
of
theirs
and
the
other
that
of
an
american
tourist
who
gave
all
the
evidences
of
great
wealth
and
had
presented
letters
to
leading
men
in
london
which
had
insured
him
attentions
not
usually
accorded
to
foreigners
this
man
s
name
was
fairbrother
and
the
moment
grey
heard
it
he
recalled
the
fact
that
an
american
with
a
peculiar
name
but
with
a
reputation
for
wealth
had
been
among
his
guests
on
the
suspected
evening
hiding
the
effect
produced
upon
him
by
this
discovery
he
placed
his
finger
on
this
name
and
begged
his
cousin
to
look
up
its
owner
s
antecedents
and
present
reputation
in
america
but
not
content
with
this
he
sent
his
own
agent
over
to
new
york
whither
as
he
soon
learned
this
gentleman
had
returned
the
result
was
an
apparent
vindication
of
the
suspected
american
he
was
found
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
great
metropolis
moving
in
the
highest
circles
and
with
a
reputation
for
wealth
won
by
an
extraordinary
business
instinct
to
be
sure
he
had
not
always
enjoyed
these
distinctions
like
many
another
man
he
had
risen
from
a
menial
position
in
a
western
mining
camp
to
be
the
owner
of
a
mine
himself
and
so
up
through
the
various
gradations
of
a
successful
life
to
a
position
among
the
foremost
business
men
of
new
york
in
all
these
changes
he
had
maintained
a
name
for
honest
if
not
generous
dealing
he
lived
in
great
style
had
married
and
was
known
to
have
but
one
extravagant
fancy
this
was
for
the
unique
and
curious
in
art
a
taste
which
if
report
spoke
true
cost
him
many
thousands
each
year
this
last
was
the
only
clause
in
the
report
which
pointed
in
any
way
toward
this
man
being
the
possible
abstractor
of
the
great
mogul
as
grey
s
famous
diamond
was
called
and
the
latter
was
too
just
a
man
and
too
much
of
a
fancier
in
this
line
himself
to
let
a
fact
of
this
kind
weigh
against
the
favorable
nature
of
the
rest
so
he
recalled
his
agent
his
cabinets
and
continued
to
confine
his
display
of
valuables
to
articles
which
did
not
suggest
jewels
thus
three
years
passed
when
one
day
he
heard
mention
made
of
a
wonderful
diamond
which
had
been
seen
in
new
york
from
its
description
he
gathered
that
it
must
be
the
one
surreptitiously
abstracted
from
his
cabinet
and
when
after
some
careful
inquiries
he
learned
that
the
name
of
its
possessor
was
fairbrother
he
awoke
to
his
old
suspicions
and
determined
to
probe
this
matter
to
the
bottom
but
secretly
he
still
had
too
much
consideration
to
attack
a
man
in
high
position
without
full
proof
knowing
of
no
one
he
could
trust
with
so
delicate
an
inquiry
as
this
had
now
become
he
decided
to
undertake
it
himself
and
for
this
purpose
embraced
the
first
opportunity
to
cross
the
water
he
took
his
daughter
with
him
because
he
had
resolved
never
to
let
his
one
remaining
child
out
of
his
sight
but
she
knew
nothing
of
his
plans
or
reason
for
travel
no
one
did
indeed
only
his
lawyer
and
the
police
were
aware
of
the
loss
of
his
diamond
his
first
surprise
on
landing
was
to
learn
that
fairbrother
of
whose
marriage
he
had
heard
had
quarreled
with
his
wife
and
that
in
the
separation
which
had
occurred
the
diamond
had
fallen
to
her
share
and
was
consequently
in
her
possession
at
the
present
moment
this
changed
matters
and
grey
s
only
thought
now
was
to
surprise
her
with
the
diamond
on
her
person
and
by
one
glance
assure
himself
that
it
was
indeed
the
great
mogul
since
fairbrother
was
reported
to
be
a
beautiful
woman
and
a
great
society
belle
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
meet
her
publicly
and
that
very
soon
he
therefore
accepted
invitations
and
attended
theaters
and
balls
though
his
daughter
had
suffered
from
her
voyage
and
was
not
able
to
accompany
him
but
alas
he
soon
learned
that
fairbrother
was
never
seen
with
her
diamond
and
one
evening
after
an
introduction
at
the
opera
that
she
never
talked
about
it
so
there
he
was
balked
on
the
very
threshold
of
his
enterprise
and
recognizing
the
fact
was
preparing
to
take
his
now
seriously
ailing
daughter
south
when
he
received
an
invitation
to
a
ball
of
such
a
select
character
that
he
decided
to
remain
for
it
in
the
hope
that
fairbrother
would
be
tempted
to
put
on
all
her
splendor
for
so
magnificent
a
function
and
thus
gratify
him
with
a
sight
of
his
own
diamond
during
the
days
that
intervened
he
saw
her
several
times
and
very
soon
decided
that
in
spite
of
her
reticence
in
regard
to
this
gem
she
was
not
sufficiently
in
her
husband
s
confidence
to
know
the
secret
of
its
real
ownership
this
encouraged
him
to
attempt
piquing
her
into
wearing
the
diamond
on
this
occasion
he
talked
of
precious
stones
and
finally
of
his
own
declaring
that
he
had
a
connoisseur
s
eye
for
a
fine
diamond
but
had
seen
none
as
yet
in
america
to
compete
with
a
specimen
or
two
he
had
in
his
own
cabinets
her
eye
flashed
at
this
and
though
she
said
nothing
he
felt
sure
that
her
presence
at
ramsdell
s
house
would
be
enlivened
by
her
great
jewel
so
much
for
grey
s
attitude
in
this
matter
up
to
the
night
of
the
ball
it
is
interesting
enough
but
that
of
abner
fairbrother
is
more
interesting
still
and
much
more
serious
his
was
indeed
the
hand
which
had
abstracted
the
diamond
from
grey
s
collection
under
ordinary
conditions
he
was
an
honest
man
he
prized
his
good
name
and
would
not
willingly
risk
it
but
he
had
little
real
conscience
and
once
his
passions
were
aroused
nothing
short
of
the
object
desired
would
content
him
at
once
forceful
and
subtle
he
had
at
his
command
infinite
resources
which
his
wandering
and
eventful
life
had
heightened
almost
to
the
point
of
genius
he
saw
this
stone
and
at
once
felt
an
inordinate
desire
to
possess
it
he
had
coveted
other
men
s
treasures
before
but
not
as
he
coveted
this
what
had
been
longing
in
other
cases
was
mania
in
this
there
was
a
woman
in
america
whom
he
loved
she
was
beautiful
and
she
was
to
see
her
with
this
glory
on
her
breast
would
be
worth
almost
any
risk
which
his
imagination
could
picture
at
the
moment
before
the
diamond
had
left
his
hand
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
have
it
for
his
own
he
knew
that
it
could
not
be
bought
so
he
set
about
obtaining
it
by
an
act
he
did
not
hesitate
to
acknowledge
to
himself
as
criminal
but
he
did
not
act
without
precautions
having
a
keen
eye
and
a
proper
sense
or
size
and
color
he
carried
away
from
his
first
view
of
it
a
true
image
of
the
stone
and
when
he
was
next
admitted
to
grey
s
cabinet
room
he
had
provided
the
means
for
deceiving
the
owner
whose
character
he
had
sounded
he
might
have
failed
in
his
daring
attempt
if
he
had
not
been
favored
by
a
circumstance
no
one
could
have
foreseen
a
daughter
of
the
house
cecilia
by
name
lay
critically
ill
at
the
time
and
grey
s
attention
was
more
or
less
distracted
still
the
probabilities
are
that
he
would
have
noticed
something
amiss
with
the
stone
when
he
came
to
restore
it
to
its
place
if
just
as
he
took
it
in
his
hand
there
had
not
risen
in
the
air
outside
a
weird
and
wailing
cry
which
at
once
seized
upon
the
imagination
of
the
dozen
gentlemen
present
and
so
nearly
prostrated
their
host
that
he
thrust
the
box
he
held
unopened
into
the
safe
and
fell
upon
his
knees
a
totally
unnerved
man
crying
the
banshee
the
banshee
my
daughter
will
die
another
hand
than
his
locked
the
safe
and
dropped
the
key
into
the
distracted
father
s
pocket
thus
a
superhuman
daring
conjoined
with
a
special
intervention
of
fate
had
made
the
enterprise
a
successful
one
and
fairbrother
believing
more
than
ever
in
his
star
carried
this
invaluable
jewel
back
with
him
to
new
york
the
stiletto
well
the
taking
of
that
was
a
folly
for
which
he
had
never
ceased
to
blush
he
had
not
stolen
it
he
would
not
steal
so
inconsiderable
an
object
he
had
merely
put
it
in
his
pocket
when
he
saw
it
forgotten
passed
over
given
to
him
as
it
were
that
the
risk
contrary
to
that
involved
in
the
taking
of
the
diamond
was
far
in
excess
of
the
gratification
obtained
he
realized
almost
immediately
but
having
made
the
break
and
acquired
the
curio
he
spared
himself
all
further
thought
or
the
consequences
and
presently
resumed
his
old
life
in
new
york
none
the
worse
to
all
appearances
for
these
escapades
from
virtue
and
his
usual
course
of
fair
and
open
dealing
but
he
was
soon
the
worse
from
jealousy
of
the
wife
which
his
new
possession
had
possibly
won
for
him
she
had
answered
all
his
expectations
as
mistress
of
his
home
and
the
exponent
of
his
wealth
and
for
a
year
nay
for
two
he
had
been
perfectly
happy
indeed
he
had
been
more
than
that
he
had
been
triumphant
especially
on
that
memorable
evening
when
after
a
cautious
delay
of
months
he
had
dared
to
pin
that
unapproachable
sparkler
to
her
breast
and
present
her
thus
bedecked
to
the
smart
set
her
whom
his
talents
and
especially
his
business
talents
had
made
his
own
recalling
the
old
days
of
barter
and
sale
across
the
pine
counter
in
colorado
he
felt
that
his
star
rode
high
and
for
a
time
was
satisfied
with
his
wife
s
magnificence
and
the
prestige
she
gave
his
establishment
but
pride
is
not
all
even
to
a
man
of
his
daring
ambition
gradually
he
began
to
realize
first
that
she
was
indifferent
to
him
next
that
she
despised
him
and
lastly
that
she
hated
him
she
had
dozens
at
her
feet
any
of
whom
was
more
agreeable
to
her
than
her
own
husband
and
though
he
could
not
put
his
finger
on
any
definite
fault
he
soon
wearied
of
a
beauty
that
only
glowed
for
others
and
made
up
his
mind
to
part
with
her
rather
than
let
his
heart
be
eaten
out
by
unappeasable
longing
for
what
his
own
good
sense
told
him
would
never
be
his
yet
being
naturally
generous
he
was
satisfied
with
a
separation
and
finding
it
impossible
to
think
of
her
as
other
than
extravagantly
fed
waited
on
and
clothed
he
allowed
her
a
good
share
of
his
fortune
with
the
one
proviso
that
she
should
not
disgrace
him
but
the
diamond
she
stole
or
rather
carried
off
in
her
naturally
manner
with
the
rest
of
her
jewels
he
had
never
given
it
to
hen
she
knew
the
value
he
set
on
it
but
not
how
he
came
by
it
and
would
have
worn
it
quite
freely
if
he
had
not
very
soon
given
her
to
understand
that
the
pleasure
of
doing
so
ceased
when
she
left
his
house
as
she
could
not
be
seen
with
it
without
occasioning
public
remark
she
was
forced
though
much
against
her
will
to
heed
his
wishes
and
enjoy
its
brilliancy
in
private
but
once
when
he
was
out
of
town
she
dared
to
appear
with
this
fortune
on
her
breast
and
again
while
on
a
visit
west
and
her
husband
heard
of
it
fairbrother
had
had
the
jewel
set
to
suit
him
not
in
florence
as
sears
had
said
but
by
a
skilful
workman
he
had
picked
up
in
great
poverty
in
a
remote
corner
of
williamsburg
always
in
dread
of
some
complication
he
had
provided
himself
with
a
second
facsimile
in
paste
this
time
of
an
astonishing
brightness
and
this
facsimile
he
had
had
set
precisely
like
the
true
stone
then
he
gave
the
workman
a
thousand
dollars
and
sent
him
back
to
switzerland
this
imitation
in
paste
he
showed
nobody
but
he
kept
it
always
in
his
pocket
why
he
hardly
knew
meantime
he
had
one
confidant
not
of
his
crime
but
of
his
sentiments
toward
his
wife
and
the
determination
he
had
secretly
made
to
proceed
to
extremities
if
she
continued
to
disobey
him
this
was
a
man
of
his
own
age
or
older
who
had
known
him
in
his
early
days
and
had
followed
all
his
fortunes
he
had
been
the
master
of
fairbrother
then
but
he
was
his
servant
now
and
as
devoted
to
his
interests
as
if
they
were
his
own
which
in
a
way
they
were
for
eighteen
years
he
had
stood
at
the
latter
s
right
hand
satisfied
to
look
no
further
but
for
the
last
three
his
glances
had
strayed
a
foot
or
two
beyond
his
master
and
taken
in
his
master
s
wife
the
feelings
which
this
man
had
for
fairbrother
were
peculiar
she
was
a
mere
adjunct
to
her
great
lord
but
she
was
a
very
gorgeous
one
and
while
he
could
not
imagine
himself
doing
anything
to
thwart
him
whose
bread
he
ate
and
to
whose
rise
he
had
himself
contributed
yet
if
he
could
remain
true
to
him
without
injuring
he
he
would
account
himself
happy
the
day
came
when
he
had
to
decide
between
them
and
against
all
chances
against
his
own
preconceived
notion
of
what
he
would
do
under
these
circumstances
he
chose
to
consider
her
this
day
came
when
in
the
midst
of
growing
complacency
and
an
intense
interest
in
some
new
scheme
which
demanded
all
his
powers
abner
fairbrother
learned
from
the
papers
that
grey
of
english
parliamentary
fame
had
arrived
in
new
york
on
an
indefinite
visit
as
no
cause
was
assigned
for
the
visit
beyond
a
natural
desire
on
the
part
of
this
eminent
statesman
to
see
this
great
country
fairbrother
s
fears
reached
a
sudden
climax
and
he
saw
himself
ruined
and
for
ever
disgraced
if
the
diamond
now
so
unhappily
out
of
his
hands
should
fall
under
the
eyes
of
its
owner
whose
seeming
quiet
under
its
loss
had
not
for
a
moment
deceived
him
waiting
only
long
enough
to
make
sure
that
the
distinguished
foreigner
was
likely
to
accept
social
attentions
and
so
in
all
probability
would
be
brought
in
contact
with
fairbrother
he
sent
her
by
his
devoted
servant
a
peremptory
message
in
which
he
demanded
back
his
diamond
and
upon
her
refusing
to
heed
this
followed
it
up
by
another
in
which
he
expressly
stated
that
if
she
took
it
out
of
the
safe
deposit
in
which
he
had
been
told
she
was
wise
enough
to
keep
it
or
wore
it
so
much
as
once
during
the
next
three
months
she
would
pay
for
her
presumption
with
her
life
this
was
no
idle
threat
though
she
chose
to
regard
it
as
such
laughing
in
the
old
servant
s
face
and
declaring
that
she
would
run
the
risk
if
the
notion
seized
her
but
the
notion
did
not
seem
to
seize
her
at
once
and
her
husband
was
beginning
to
take
heart
when
he
heard
of
the
great
ball
about
to
be
given
by
the
ramsdells
and
realized
that
if
she
were
going
to
be
tempted
to
wear
the
diamond
at
all
it
would
be
at
this
brilliant
function
given
in
honor
of
the
one
man
he
had
most
cause
to
fear
in
the
whole
world
sears
seeing
the
emotion
he
was
under
watched
him
closely
they
had
both
been
on
the
point
of
starting
for
new
mexico
to
visit
a
mine
in
which
fairbrother
was
interested
and
he
waited
with
inconceivable
anxiety
to
see
if
his
master
would
change
his
plans
it
was
while
he
was
in
this
condition
of
mind
that
he
was
seen
to
shake
his
fist
at
fairbrother
s
passing
figure
a
menace
naturally
interpreted
as
directed
against
her
but
which
if
we
know
the
man
was
rather
the
expression
of
his
anger
against
the
husband
who
could
rebuke
and
threaten
so
beautiful
a
creature
meanwhile
fairbrother
s
preparations
went
on
and
three
weeks
before
the
ball
they
started
fairbrother
had
business
in
chicago
and
business
in
denver
it
was
two
weeks
and
more
before
he
reached
la
junta
sears
counted
the
days
at
la
junta
they
had
a
long
conversation
or
rather
fairbrother
talked
and
sears
listened
the
sum
of
what
he
said
was
this
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
have
back
his
diamond
he
was
going
to
new
york
to
get
it
he
was
going
alone
and
as
he
wished
no
one
to
know
that
he
had
gone
or
that
his
plans
had
been
in
any
way
interrupted
the
other
was
to
continue
on
to
el
moro
and
passing
himself
off
as
fairbrother
hire
a
room
at
the
hotel
and
shut
himself
up
in
it
for
ten
days
on
any
plea
his
ingenuity
might
suggest
if
at
the
end
of
that
time
fairbrother
should
rejoin
him
well
and
good
they
would
go
on
together
to
santa
fe
but
if
for
any
reason
the
former
should
delay
his
return
then
sears
was
to
exercise
his
own
judgment
as
to
the
length
of
time
he
should
retain
his
borrowed
personality
also
as
to
the
advisability
of
pushing
on
to
the
mine
and
entering
on
the
work
there
as
had
been
planned
between
them
sears
knew
what
all
this
meant
he
understood
what
was
in
his
master
s
mind
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
taken
into
his
full
confidence
and
openly
accepted
his
part
of
the
business
with
seeming
alacrity
even
to
the
point
of
supplying
fairbrother
with
suitable
references
as
to
the
ability
of
one
james
wellgood
to
fill
a
waiter
s
place
at
fashionable
functions
it
was
not
the
first
he
had
given
him
seventeen
years
before
he
had
written
the
same
minus
the
last
phrase
that
was
when
he
was
the
master
and
fairbrother
the
man
but
he
did
not
mean
to
play
the
part
laid
out
for
him
for
all
his
apparent
acquiescence
he
began
by
following
the
other
s
instructions
he
exchanged
clothes
with
him
and
other
necessaries
and
took
the
train
for
la
junta
at
or
near
the
time
that
fairbrother
started
east
but
once
at
el
moro
once
registered
there
as
abner
fairbrother
from
new
york
he
took
a
different
course
from
the
one
laid
out
for
him
a
course
which
finally
brought
him
into
his
master
s
wake
and
landed
him
at
the
same
hour
in
new
york
this
is
what
he
did
instead
of
shutting
himself
up
in
his
room
he
expressed
an
immediate
desire
to
visit
some
neighboring
mines
and
procuring
a
good
horse
started
off
at
the
first
available
moment
he
rode
north
lost
himself
in
the
mountains
and
wandered
till
he
found
a
guide
intelligent
enough
to
lend
himself
to
his
plans
to
this
guide
he
confided
his
horse
for
the
few
days
he
intended
to
be
gone
paying
him
well
and
promising
him
additional
money
if
during
his
absence
he
succeeded
in
circulating
the
report
that
he
abner
fairbrother
had
gone
deep
into
the
mountains
bound
for
such
and
such
a
camp
having
thus
provided
an
alibi
not
only
for
himself
but
for
his
master
too
in
case
he
should
need
it
he
took
the
direct
road
to
the
nearest
railway
station
and
started
on
his
long
ride
east
he
did
not
expect
to
overtake
the
man
he
had
been
personating
but
fortune
was
kinder
than
is
usual
in
such
cases
and
owing
to
a
delay
caused
by
some
accident
to
a
freight
train
he
arrived
in
chicago
within
a
couple
of
hours
of
fairbrother
and
started
out
of
that
city
on
the
same
train
but
not
on
the
same
car
sears
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
fairbrother
on
the
platform
and
was
careful
to
keep
out
of
his
sight
this
was
easy
enough
he
bought
a
compartment
in
the
sleeper
and
stayed
in
it
till
they
arrived
at
the
grand
central
station
then
he
hastened
out
and
fortune
favoring
him
with
another
glimpse
of
the
man
in
whose
movements
he
was
so
interested
followed
him
into
the
streets
fairbrother
had
shaved
off
his
beard
before
leaving
el
moro
sears
had
shaved
his
off
on
the
train
both
were
changed
the
former
the
more
owing
to
a
peculiarity
of
his
mouth
which
up
till
now
he
had
always
thought
best
to
cover
sears
therefore
walked
behind
him
without
fear
and
was
almost
at
his
heels
when
this
owner
of
one
of
new
york
s
most
notable
mansions
entered
with
a
spruce
air
the
doors
of
a
prominent
caterer
understanding
the
plot
now
and
having
everything
to
fear
for
his
mistress
he
walked
the
streets
for
some
hours
in
a
state
of
great
indecision
then
he
went
up
to
her
apartment
but
he
had
no
sooner
come
within
sight
of
it
than
a
sense
of
disloyalty
struck
him
and
he
slunk
away
only
to
come
sidling
back
when
it
was
too
late
and
she
had
started
for
the
ball
trembling
with
apprehension
but
still
strangely
divided
in
his
impulses
wishing
to
serve
master
and
mistress
both
without
disloyalty
to
the
one
or
injury
to
the
other
he
hesitated
and
argued
with
himself
till
his
fears
for
the
latter
drove
him
to
ramsdell
s
house
the
night
was
a
stormy
one
the
heaviest
snow
of
the
season
was
falling
with
a
high
gale
blowing
down
the
sound
as
he
approached
the
house
which
as
we
know
is
one
of
the
modern
ones
in
the
riverside
district
he
felt
his
heart
fail
him
but
as
he
came
nearer
and
got
the
full
effect
of
glancing
lights
seductive
music
and
the
cheery
bustle
of
crowding
carriages
he
saw
in
his
mind
s
eye
such
a
picture
of
his
beautiful
mistress
threatened
unknown
to
herself
in
a
quarter
she
little
realized
that
he
lost
all
sense
of
what
had
hitherto
deterred
him
making
then
and
there
his
great
choice
he
looked
about
for
the
entrance
with
the
full
intention
of
seeing
and
warning
her
but
this
he
presently
perceived
was
totally
impracticable
he
could
neither
go
to
her
nor
expect
her
to
come
to
him
meanwhile
time
was
passing
and
if
his
master
was
there
the
thought
made
his
head
dizzy
and
situated
as
he
was
among
the
carriages
he
might
have
been
run
over
in
his
confusion
if
his
eyes
had
not
suddenly
fallen
on
a
lighted
window
the
shade
of
which
had
been
inadvertently
left
up
within
this
window
which
was
only
a
few
feet
above
his
head
stood
the
glowing
image
of
a
woman
clad
in
pink
and
sparkling
with
jewels
her
face
was
turned
from
him
but
he
recognized
her
splendor
as
that
of
the
one
woman
who
could
never
be
too
gorgeous
for
his
taste
and
alive
to
this
unexpected
opportunity
he
made
for
this
window
with
the
intention
of
shouting
up
to
her
and
so
attracting
her
attention
but
this
proved
futile
and
driven
at
last
to
the
end
of
his
resources
he
tore
out
a
slip
of
paper
from
his
and
in
the
dark
and
with
the
blinding
snow
in
his
eyes
wrote
the
few
broken
sentences
which
he
thought
would
best
warn
her
without
compromising
his
master
the
means
he
took
to
reach
her
with
this
note
i
have
already
related
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
in
her
hands
he
fled
the
place
and
took
the
first
train
west
he
was
in
a
pitiable
condition
when
three
days
later
he
reached
the
small
station
from
which
he
had
originally
set
out
the
haste
the
exposure
the
horror
of
the
crime
he
had
failed
to
avert
had
undermined
his
hitherto
excellent
constitution
and
the
symptoms
of
a
serious
illness
were
beginning
to
make
themselves
manifest
but
he
like
his
indomitable
master
possessed
a
great
fund
of
energy
and
willpower
he
saw
that
if
he
was
to
save
abner
fairbrother
and
now
that
fairbrother
was
dead
his
old
master
was
all
the
world
to
him
he
must
make
fairbrother
s
alibi
good
by
carrying
on
the
deception
as
planned
by
the
latter
and
getting
as
soon
as
possible
to
his
camp
in
the
new
mexico
mountains
he
knew
that
he
would
have
strength
to
do
this
and
he
went
about
it
without
sparing
himself
making
his
way
into
the
mountains
he
found
the
guide
and
his
horse
at
the
place
agreed
upon
and
paying
the
guide
enough
for
his
services
to
insure
a
quiet
tongue
rode
back
toward
el
moro
where
he
was
met
and
sent
on
to
santa
fe
as
already
related
such
is
the
real
explanation
of
the
unintelligible
scrawl
found
in
fairbrother
s
hand
after
her
death
as
to
the
one
which
left
miss
grey
s
bedside
for
this
same
house
it
was
alike
in
the
writing
and
sending
the
loving
freak
of
a
very
sick
but
girl
she
had
noted
the
look
with
which
grey
had
left
her
and
in
her
delirious
state
thought
that
a
line
in
her
own
hand
would
convince
him
of
her
good
condition
and
make
it
possible
for
him
to
enjoy
the
evening
she
was
however
too
much
afraid
of
her
nurse
to
write
it
openly
and
though
we
never
found
that
scrawl
it
was
doubtless
not
very
different
in
appearance
from
the
one
with
which
i
had
confounded
it
the
man
to
whom
it
was
intrusted
stopped
for
too
many
warming
drinks
on
his
way
for
it
ever
to
reach
ramsdell
s
house
he
did
not
even
return
home
that
night
and
when
he
did
put
in
an
appearance
the
next
morning
he
was
dismissed
this
takes
me
back
to
the
ball
and
fairbrother
she
had
never
had
much
fear
of
her
husband
till
she
received
his
old
servant
s
note
in
the
peculiar
manner
already
mentioned
this
coming
through
the
night
and
the
wet
and
with
all
the
marks
of
hurry
upon
it
did
impress
her
greatly
and
led
her
to
take
the
first
means
which
offered
of
ridding
herself
of
her
dangerous
ornament
the
story
of
this
we
know
meanwhile
a
burning
heart
and
a
scheming
brain
were
keeping
up
their
deadly
work
a
few
paces
off
under
the
impassive
aspect
and
active
movements
of
the
caterer
s
waiter
abner
fairbrother
whose
real
character
no
one
had
ever
been
able
to
sound
unless
it
was
the
man
who
had
known
him
in
his
days
of
struggle
was
one
of
those
dangerous
men
who
can
conceal
under
a
still
brow
and
a
noiseless
manner
the
most
violent
passions
and
the
most
desperate
resolves
he
was
angry
with
his
wife
who
was
deliberately
jeopardizing
his
good
name
and
he
had
come
there
to
kill
her
if
he
found
her
flaunting
the
diamond
in
grey
s
eyes
and
though
no
one
could
have
detected
any
change
in
his
look
and
manner
as
he
passed
through
the
room
where
these
two
were
standing
the
doom
of
that
fair
woman
was
struck
when
he
saw
the
eager
scrutiny
and
indescribable
air
of
recognition
with
which
this
gentleman
eyed
his
own
diamond
he
had
meant
to
attack
her
openly
seize
the
diamond
fling
it
at
grey
s
feet
and
then
kill
himself
that
had
been
his
plan
but
when
he
found
after
a
round
or
two
among
the
guests
that
nobody
looked
at
him
and
nobody
recognized
the
millionaire
in
the
figure
with
the
whiskers
and
hair
colder
purposes
intervened
and
he
asked
himself
if
it
would
not
be
possible
to
come
upon
her
alone
strike
his
blow
possess
himself
of
the
diamond
and
make
for
parts
unknown
before
his
identity
could
be
discovered
he
loved
life
even
without
the
charm
cast
over
it
by
this
woman
its
struggles
and
its
luxuries
fascinated
him
if
grey
suspected
him
why
grey
was
english
and
he
a
resourceful
american
if
it
came
to
an
issue
the
subtle
american
would
win
if
grey
were
not
able
to
point
to
the
flaw
which
marked
this
diamond
as
his
own
and
this
fairbrother
had
provided
against
and
would
succeed
in
if
he
could
hold
his
passions
in
check
and
be
ready
with
all
his
wit
when
matters
reached
a
climax
such
were
the
thoughts
and
such
the
plans
of
the
quiet
attentive
man
who
with
his
tray
laden
with
coffee
and
ices
came
and
went
an
unnoticed
unit
among
twenty
other
units
similarly
quiet
and
similarly
attentive
he
waited
on
lady
after
lady
and
when
on
the
reissuing
of
durand
from
the
alcove
he
passed
in
there
with
his
tray
and
his
two
cups
of
coffee
nobody
heeded
and
nobody
remembered
it
was
all
over
in
a
minute
and
he
came
out
still
unnoted
and
went
to
the
for
more
cups
of
coffee
but
that
minute
had
set
its
seal
on
his
heart
for
ever
she
was
sitting
there
alone
with
her
side
to
the
entrance
so
that
he
had
to
pass
around
in
order
to
face
her
her
elegance
and
a
certain
air
she
had
of
remoteness
from
the
scene
of
which
she
was
the
glowing
center
when
she
smiled
awed
him
and
made
his
hand
loosen
a
little
on
the
slender
stiletto
he
held
close
against
the
bottom
of
the
tray
but
such
resolution
does
not
easily
yield
and
his
fingers
soon
tightened
again
this
time
with
a
deadly
grip
he
had
expected
to
meet
the
flash
of
the
diamond
as
he
bent
over
her
and
dreaded
doing
so
for
fear
it
would
attract
his
eye
from
her
face
and
so
cost
him
the
sight
of
that
startled
recognition
which
would
give
the
desired
point
to
his
revenge
but
the
tray
as
he
held
it
shielded
her
breast
from
view
and
when
he
lowered
it
to
strike
his
blow
he
thought
of
nothing
but
aiming
so
truly
as
to
need
no
second
blow
he
had
had
his
experience
in
those
old
years
in
a
mining
camp
and
he
did
not
fear
failure
in
this
what
he
did
fear
was
her
utterance
of
some
cry
possibly
his
name
but
she
was
stunned
with
horror
and
did
not
shriek
horror
of
him
whose
eyes
she
met
with
her
glassy
and
staring
ones
as
he
slowly
drew
forth
the
weapon
why
he
drew
it
forth
instead
of
leaving
it
in
her
breast
he
could
not
say
possibly
because
it
gave
him
his
moment
of
gloating
revenge
when
in
another
instant
her
hands
flew
up
and
the
tray
tipped
and
the
china
fell
the
revulsion
came
and
his
eyes
opened
to
two
facts
the
instrument
of
death
was
still
in
his
grasp
and
the
diamond
on
whose
possession
he
counted
was
gone
from
his
wife
s
breast
it
was
a
horrible
moment
voices
could
be
heard
approaching
the
alcove
laughing
voices
that
in
an
instant
would
take
on
the
note
of
horror
and
the
music
ah
how
low
it
had
sunk
as
if
to
give
place
to
the
dying
murmur
he
now
heard
issuing
from
her
lips
but
he
was
a
man
of
iron
thrusting
the
stiletto
into
the
first
place
that
offered
he
drew
the
curtains
over
the
staring
windows
then
slid
out
with
his
tray
calm
speckless
and
attentive
as
ever
dead
to
thought
dead
to
feeling
but
aware
quite
aware
in
the
secret
depths
of
his
being
that
something
besides
his
wife
had
been
killed
that
night
and
that
sleep
and
peace
of
mind
and
all
pleasure
in
the
past
were
gone
for
ever
it
was
not
he
i
saw
enter
the
alcove
and
come
out
with
news
of
the
crime
he
left
this
role
to
one
whose
antecedents
could
better
bear
investigation
his
part
was
to
play
with
just
the
proper
display
of
horror
and
curiosity
the
ordinary
menial
brought
face
to
face
with
a
crime
in
high
life
he
could
do
this
he
could
even
sustain
his
share
in
the
gossip
and
for
this
purpose
kept
near
the
other
waiters
the
absence
of
the
diamond
was
all
that
troubled
him
that
brought
him
at
times
to
the
point
of
vertigo
had
grey
recognized
and
claimed
it
if
so
he
abner
fairbrother
must
remain
james
wellgood
the
waiter
indefinitely
this
would
require
more
belief
in
his
star
than
ever
he
had
had
yet
but
as
the
moments
passed
and
no
contradiction
was
given
to
the
impression
that
the
same
hand
which
had
struck
the
blow
had
taken
the
diamond
even
this
cause
of
anxiety
left
his
breast
and
he
faced
people
with
more
and
more
courage
till
the
moment
when
he
suddenly
heard
that
the
diamond
had
been
found
in
the
possession
of
a
man
perfectly
strange
to
him
and
saw
the
inspector
pass
it
over
into
the
hands
of
grey
instantly
he
realized
that
the
crisis
of
his
fate
was
on
him
if
grey
were
given
time
to
identify
this
stone
he
abner
fairbrother
was
lost
and
the
diamond
as
well
could
he
prevent
this
there
was
but
one
way
and
that
way
he
took
making
use
of
his
ventriloquial
powers
he
had
spent
a
year
on
the
public
stage
in
those
early
days
playing
just
such
tricks
as
these
he
raised
the
one
cry
which
he
knew
would
startle
grey
more
than
any
other
in
the
world
and
when
the
diamond
fell
from
his
hand
as
he
knew
it
would
he
rushed
forward
and
in
the
act
of
picking
it
up
made
that
exchange
which
not
only
baffled
the
suspicions
of
the
statesman
but
restored
to
him
the
diamond
for
whose
possession
he
was
now
ready
to
barter
half
his
remaining
days
meanwhile
grey
had
had
his
own
anxieties
during
this
whole
long
evening
he
had
been
sustained
by
the
conviction
that
the
diamond
of
which
he
had
caught
but
one
passing
glimpse
was
the
great
mogul
of
his
once
famous
collection
so
sure
was
he
of
this
that
at
one
moment
he
found
himself
tempted
to
enter
the
alcove
demand
a
closer
sight
of
the
diamond
and
settle
the
question
then
and
there
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
take
in
his
hands
the
two
cups
of
coffee
which
should
serve
as
his
excuse
for
this
intrusion
but
his
naturally
chivalrous
instincts
again
intervened
and
he
set
the
cups
down
again
this
i
did
not
see
and
turned
his
steps
toward
the
library
with
the
intention
of
writing
her
a
note
instead
but
though
he
found
paper
and
pen
to
hand
he
could
find
no
words
for
so
daring
a
request
and
he
came
back
into
the
hall
only
to
hear
that
the
woman
he
had
contemplated
addressing
had
just
been
murdered
and
her
great
jewel
stolen
the
shock
was
too
much
and
as
there
was
no
leaving
the
house
then
he
retreated
again
to
the
library
where
he
devoured
his
anxieties
in
silence
till
hope
revived
again
at
sight
of
the
diamond
in
the
inspector
s
hand
only
to
vanish
under
the
machinations
of
one
he
did
not
even
recognize
when
he
took
the
false
jewel
from
his
hand
the
american
had
outwitted
the
englishman
and
the
triumph
of
evil
was
complete
or
so
it
seemed
but
if
the
englishman
is
slow
he
is
sure
thrown
off
the
track
for
the
time
being
grey
had
only
to
see
a
picture
of
the
stiletto
in
the
papers
to
feel
again
that
despite
all
appearances
fairbrother
was
really
not
only
at
the
bottom
of
the
thefts
from
which
his
cousin
and
himself
had
suffered
but
of
this
frightful
murder
as
well
he
made
no
open
move
he
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
and
much
disturbed
besides
by
his
fears
for
his
daughter
but
he
started
a
secret
inquiry
through
his
old
valet
whom
he
ran
across
in
the
street
and
whose
peculiar
adaptability
for
this
kind
of
work
he
well
knew
the
aim
of
these
inquiries
was
to
determine
if
the
person
whom
two
physicians
and
three
assistants
were
endeavoring
to
nurse
back
to
health
on
the
top
of
a
wild
plateau
in
a
remote
district
of
new
mexico
was
the
man
he
had
once
entertained
at
his
own
board
in
england
and
the
adventures
thus
incurred
would
make
a
story
in
itself
but
the
result
seemed
to
justify
them
word
came
after
innumerable
delays
very
trying
to
grey
that
he
was
not
the
same
though
he
bore
the
name
of
fairbrother
and
was
considered
by
every
one
around
there
to
be
fairbrother
grey
ignorant
of
the
relations
between
the
millionaire
master
and
his
man
which
sometimes
led
to
the
latter
s
personifying
the
former
was
confident
of
his
own
mistake
and
bitterly
ashamed
of
his
own
suspicions
but
a
second
message
set
him
right
a
deception
was
being
practised
down
in
new
mexico
and
this
was
how
his
spy
had
found
it
out
certain
letters
which
went
into
the
sick
tent
were
sent
away
again
and
always
to
one
address
he
had
learned
the
address
it
was
that
of
james
wellgood
c
maine
if
grey
would
look
up
this
wellgood
he
would
doubtless
learn
something
of
the
man
he
was
so
interested
in
this
gave
grey
personally
something
to
do
for
he
would
trust
no
second
party
with
a
message
involving
the
honor
of
a
possibly
innocent
man
as
the
place
was
accessible
by
railroad
and
his
duty
clear
he
took
the
journey
involved
and
succeeded
in
getting
a
glimpse
in
the
manner
we
know
of
the
man
james
wellgood
this
time
he
recognized
fairbrother
and
satisfied
from
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
that
he
would
be
making
no
mistake
in
accusing
him
of
having
taken
the
great
mogul
he
intercepted
him
in
his
flight
as
you
have
already
read
and
demanded
the
immediate
return
of
his
great
diamond
and
fairbrother
we
shall
have
to
go
back
a
little
to
bring
his
history
up
to
this
critical
instant
when
he
realized
the
trend
of
public
opinion
when
he
saw
a
perfectly
innocent
man
committed
to
the
tombs
for
his
crime
he
was
first
astonished
and
then
amused
at
what
he
continued
to
regard
as
the
triumph
of
his
star
but
he
did
not
start
for
el
moro
wise
as
he
felt
it
would
be
to
do
so
something
of
the
fascination
usual
with
criminals
kept
him
near
the
scene
of
his
crime
that
and
an
anxiety
to
see
how
sears
would
conduct
himself
in
the
southwest
that
sears
had
followed
him
to
new
york
knew
his
crime
and
was
the
strongest
witness
against
him
was
as
far
from
his
thoughts
as
that
he
owed
him
the
warning
which
had
all
but
balked
him
of
his
revenge
when
therefore
he
read
in
the
papers
that
abner
fairbrother
had
been
found
sick
in
his
camp
at
santa
fe
he
felt
that
nothing
now
stood
in
the
way
of
his
entering
on
the
plans
he
had
framed
for
ultimate
escape
on
his
departure
from
el
moro
he
had
taken
the
precaution
of
giving
sears
the
name
of
a
certain
small
town
on
the
coast
of
maine
where
his
mail
was
to
be
sent
in
case
of
a
great
emergency
he
had
chosen
this
town
for
two
reasons
first
because
he
knew
all
about
it
having
had
a
young
man
from
there
in
his
employ
secondly
because
of
its
neighborhood
to
the
inlet
where
an
old
launch
of
his
had
been
docked
for
the
winter
always
astute
always
precautionary
he
had
given
orders
to
have
this
launch
floated
and
provisioned
so
that
now
he
had
only
to
send
word
to
the
captain
to
have
at
his
command
the
best
possible
means
of
escape
meanwhile
he
must
make
good
his
position
in
c
he
did
it
in
the
way
we
know
satisfied
that
the
only
danger
he
need
fear
was
the
discovery
of
the
fraud
practised
in
new
mexico
he
had
confidence
enough
in
sears
even
in
his
present
disabled
state
to
take
his
time
and
make
himself
solid
with
the
people
of
c
while
waiting
for
the
ice
to
disappear
from
the
harbor
this
accomplished
and
cruising
made
possible
he
took
a
flying
trip
to
new
york
to
secure
such
papers
and
valuables
as
he
wished
to
carry
out
of
the
country
with
him
they
were
in
safe
deposit
but
that
safe
deposit
was
in
his
strong
room
in
the
center
of
his
house
in
street
a
room
which
you
will
remember
in
connection
with
sweetwater
s
adventure
to
enter
his
own
door
with
his
own
in
the
security
and
darkness
of
a
stormy
night
seemed
to
this
man
a
matter
of
no
great
risk
nor
did
he
find
it
so
he
reached
his
strong
room
procured
his
securities
and
was
leaving
the
house
without
having
suffered
an
alarm
when
some
instinct
of
suggested
to
him
the
advisability
of
arming
himself
with
a
pistol
his
own
was
in
maine
but
he
remembered
where
sears
kept
his
he
had
seen
it
often
enough
in
that
old
trunk
he
had
brought
with
him
from
the
sierras
he
accordingly
went
up
stairs
to
the
steward
s
room
found
the
pistol
and
became
from
that
instant
invincible
but
in
restoring
the
articles
he
had
pulled
out
he
came
across
a
photograph
of
his
wife
and
lost
himself
over
it
and
went
mad
as
we
have
heard
the
detective
tell
that
later
he
should
succeed
in
trapping
this
detective
and
should
leave
the
house
without
a
qualm
as
to
his
fate
shows
what
sort
of
man
he
was
in
moments
of
extreme
danger
i
doubt
from
what
i
have
heard
of
him
since
if
he
ever
gave
two
thoughts
to
the
man
after
he
had
sprung
the
double
lock
on
him
which
considering
his
extreme
ignorance
of
who
his
victim
was
or
what
relation
he
bore
to
his
own
fate
was
certainly
remarkable
back
again
in
c
he
made
his
final
preparations
for
departure
he
had
already
communicated
with
the
captain
of
the
launch
who
may
or
may
not
have
known
his
passenger
s
real
name
he
says
that
he
supposed
him
to
be
some
agent
of
fairbrother
s
that
among
the
first
orders
he
received
from
that
gentleman
was
one
to
the
effect
that
he
was
to
follow
the
instructions
of
one
wellgood
as
if
they
came
from
himself
that
he
had
done
so
and
not
till
he
had
fairbrother
on
board
had
he
known
whom
he
was
expected
to
carry
into
other
waters
however
there
are
many
who
do
not
believe
the
captain
fairbrother
had
a
genius
for
rousing
devotion
in
the
men
who
worked
for
him
and
probably
this
man
was
another
sears
to
leave
speculation
all
was
in
train
then
and
freedom
but
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
when
the
boat
he
was
in
was
stopped
by
another
and
he
heard
grey
s
voice
demanding
the
jewel
the
shock
was
severe
and
he
had
need
of
all
the
nerve
which
had
hitherto
made
his
career
so
prosperous
to
sustain
the
encounter
with
the
calmness
which
alone
could
carry
off
the
situation
declaring
that
the
diamond
was
in
new
york
he
promised
to
restore
it
if
the
other
would
make
the
sacrifice
worth
while
by
continuing
to
preserve
his
hitherto
admirable
silence
concerning
him
grey
responded
by
granting
him
just
hours
and
when
fairbrother
said
the
time
was
not
long
enough
and
allowed
his
hand
to
steal
ominously
to
his
breast
he
repeated
still
more
decisively
the
honored
bravery
withdrawing
his
hand
from
his
breast
he
brought
out
a
instead
of
a
pistol
and
in
a
tone
fully
as
determined
replied
the
diamond
is
in
a
place
inaccessible
to
any
one
but
myself
if
you
will
put
your
name
to
a
promise
not
to
betray
me
for
the
hours
i
ask
i
will
sign
one
to
restore
you
the
diamond
before
o
clock
on
i
will
said
grey
so
the
promises
were
written
and
duly
exchanged
grey
returned
to
new
york
and
fairbrother
boarded
his
launch
the
diamond
really
was
in
new
york
and
to
him
it
seemed
more
politic
to
use
it
as
a
means
of
securing
grey
s
permanent
silence
than
to
fly
the
country
leaving
a
man
behind
him
who
knew
his
secret
and
could
precipitate
his
doom
with
a
word
he
would
therefore
go
to
new
york
play
his
last
great
card
and
if
he
lost
be
no
worse
off
than
he
was
now
he
did
not
mean
to
lose
but
he
had
not
calculated
on
any
inherent
weakness
in
himself
had
not
calculated
on
providence
a
dish
tumbled
and
with
it
fell
into
chaos
the
fair
structure
of
his
dreams
with
the
cry
of
grizel
grizel
he
gave
up
his
secret
his
hopes
and
his
life
there
was
no
retrieval
possible
after
that
the
star
of
abner
fairbrother
had
set
grey
and
his
daughter
learned
very
soon
of
my
relations
to
durand
but
through
the
precautions
of
the
inspector
and
my
own
powers
of
no
suspicion
has
ever
crossed
their
minds
of
the
part
i
once
played
in
the
matter
of
the
stiletto
this
was
amply
proved
by
the
invitation
durand
and
i
have
just
received
to
spend
our
honeymoon
at
darlington
manor
