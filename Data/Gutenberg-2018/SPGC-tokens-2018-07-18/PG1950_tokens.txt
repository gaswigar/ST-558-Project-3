a
woman
of
thirty
i
early
mistakes
it
was
a
sunday
morning
in
the
beginning
of
april
a
morning
which
gave
promise
of
one
of
those
bright
days
when
parisians
for
the
first
time
in
the
year
behold
dry
pavements
underfoot
and
a
cloudless
sky
overhead
it
was
not
yet
noon
when
a
luxurious
cabriolet
drawn
by
two
spirited
horses
turned
out
of
the
rue
de
castiglione
into
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
drew
up
behind
a
row
of
carriages
standing
before
the
newly
opened
barrier
down
the
terrasse
de
feuillants
the
owner
of
the
carriage
looked
anxious
and
out
of
health
the
thin
hair
on
his
sallow
temples
turning
gray
already
gave
a
look
of
premature
age
to
his
face
he
flung
the
reins
to
a
servant
who
followed
on
horseback
and
alighted
to
take
in
his
arms
a
young
girl
whose
dainty
beauty
had
already
attracted
the
eyes
of
loungers
on
the
terrasse
the
little
lady
standing
upon
the
carriage
step
graciously
submitted
to
be
taken
by
the
waist
putting
an
arm
round
the
neck
of
her
guide
who
set
her
down
upon
the
pavement
without
so
much
as
ruffling
the
trimming
of
her
green
rep
dress
no
lover
would
have
been
so
careful
the
stranger
could
only
be
the
father
of
the
young
girl
who
took
his
arm
familiarly
without
a
word
of
thanks
and
hurried
him
into
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
the
old
father
noted
the
wondering
stare
which
some
of
the
young
men
gave
the
couple
and
the
sad
expression
left
his
face
for
a
moment
although
he
had
long
since
reached
the
time
of
life
when
a
man
is
fain
to
be
content
with
such
illusory
delights
as
vanity
bestows
he
began
to
smile
they
think
you
are
my
wife
he
said
in
the
young
lady
s
ear
and
he
held
himself
erect
and
walked
with
slow
steps
which
filled
his
daughter
with
despair
he
seemed
to
take
up
the
coquette
s
part
for
her
perhaps
of
the
two
he
was
the
more
gratified
by
the
curious
glances
directed
at
those
little
feet
shod
with
prunella
at
the
dainty
figure
outlined
by
a
bodice
filled
in
with
an
embroidered
chemisette
which
only
partially
concealed
the
girlish
throat
her
dress
was
lifted
by
her
movements
as
she
walked
giving
glimpses
higher
than
the
shoes
of
delicately
moulded
outlines
beneath
silk
stockings
more
than
one
of
the
idlers
turned
and
passed
the
pair
again
to
admire
or
to
catch
a
second
glimpse
of
the
young
face
about
which
the
brown
tresses
played
there
was
a
glow
in
its
white
and
red
partly
reflected
from
the
satin
lining
of
her
fashionable
bonnet
partly
due
to
the
eagerness
and
impatience
which
sparkled
in
every
feature
a
mischievous
sweetness
lighted
up
the
beautiful
dark
eyes
bathed
in
liquid
brightness
shaded
by
the
long
lashes
and
curving
arch
of
eyebrow
life
and
youth
displayed
their
treasures
in
the
petulant
face
and
in
the
gracious
outlines
of
the
bust
unspoiled
even
by
the
fashion
of
the
day
which
brought
the
girdle
under
the
breast
the
young
lady
herself
appeared
to
be
insensible
to
admiration
her
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
sort
of
anxiety
on
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
the
goal
doubtless
of
her
petulant
promenade
it
wanted
but
fifteen
minutes
of
noon
yet
even
at
that
early
hour
several
women
in
gala
dress
were
coming
away
from
the
tuileries
not
without
backward
glances
at
the
gates
and
pouting
looks
of
discontent
as
if
they
regretted
the
lateness
of
the
arrival
which
had
cheated
them
of
a
spectacle
chance
carried
a
few
words
let
fall
by
one
of
these
disappointed
fair
ones
to
the
ears
of
the
charming
stranger
and
put
her
in
a
more
than
common
uneasiness
the
elderly
man
watched
the
signs
of
impatience
and
apprehension
which
flitted
across
his
companion
s
pretty
face
with
interest
rather
than
amusement
in
his
eyes
observing
her
with
a
close
and
careful
attention
which
perhaps
could
only
be
prompted
by
some
in
the
depths
of
a
father
s
mind
it
was
the
thirteenth
sunday
of
the
year
in
two
days
time
napoleon
was
to
set
out
upon
the
disastrous
campaign
in
which
he
was
to
lose
first
bessieres
and
then
duroc
he
was
to
win
the
memorable
battles
of
lutzen
and
bautzen
to
see
himself
treacherously
deserted
by
austria
saxony
bavaria
and
bernadotte
and
to
dispute
the
dreadful
field
of
leipsic
the
magnificent
review
commanded
for
that
day
by
the
emperor
was
to
be
the
last
of
so
many
which
had
long
drawn
forth
the
admiration
of
paris
and
of
foreign
visitors
for
the
last
time
the
old
guard
would
execute
their
scientific
military
manoeuvres
with
the
pomp
and
precision
which
sometimes
amazed
the
giant
himself
napoleon
was
nearly
ready
for
his
duel
with
europe
it
was
a
sad
sentiment
which
brought
a
brilliant
and
curious
throng
to
the
tuileries
each
mind
seemed
to
foresee
the
future
perhaps
too
in
every
mind
another
thought
was
dimly
present
how
that
in
the
future
when
the
heroic
age
of
france
should
have
taken
the
color
with
which
it
is
tinged
for
us
men
s
imaginations
would
more
than
once
seek
to
retrace
the
picture
of
the
pageant
which
they
were
assembled
to
behold
do
let
us
go
more
quickly
father
i
can
hear
the
drums
the
young
girl
said
and
in
a
manner
she
urged
her
companion
forward
the
troops
are
marching
into
the
tuileries
said
he
or
marching
out
of
it
everybody
is
coming
away
she
answered
in
childish
vexation
which
drew
a
smile
from
her
father
the
review
only
begins
at
twelve
he
said
he
had
fallen
half
behind
his
impetuous
daughter
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
she
meant
to
hasten
their
progress
by
a
movement
of
her
right
arm
for
it
swung
like
an
oar
blade
through
the
water
in
her
impatience
she
had
crushed
her
handkerchief
into
a
ball
in
her
tiny
fingers
now
and
then
the
old
man
smiled
but
the
smiles
were
succeeded
by
an
anxious
look
which
crossed
his
withered
face
and
saddened
it
in
his
love
for
the
fair
young
girl
by
his
side
he
was
as
fain
to
exalt
the
present
moment
as
to
dread
the
future
she
is
happy
will
her
happiness
last
he
seemed
to
ask
himself
for
the
old
are
somewhat
prone
to
foresee
their
own
sorrows
in
the
future
of
the
young
father
and
daughter
reached
the
peristyle
under
the
tower
where
the
tricolor
flag
was
still
waving
but
as
they
passed
under
the
arch
by
which
people
came
and
went
between
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
and
the
place
du
carrousel
the
sentries
on
guard
called
out
sternly
no
admittance
this
by
standing
on
tiptoe
the
young
girl
contrived
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
crowd
of
women
thronging
either
side
of
the
old
marble
arcade
along
which
the
emperor
was
to
pass
we
were
too
late
in
starting
father
you
can
see
that
quite
a
little
piteous
pout
revealed
the
immense
importance
which
she
attached
to
the
sight
of
this
particular
review
very
well
julie
let
us
go
away
you
dislike
a
do
let
us
stay
father
even
here
i
may
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
emperor
he
might
die
during
this
campaign
and
then
i
should
never
have
seen
her
father
shuddered
at
the
selfish
speech
there
were
tears
in
the
girl
s
voice
he
looked
at
her
and
thought
that
he
saw
tears
beneath
her
lowered
eyelids
tears
caused
not
so
much
by
the
disappointment
as
by
one
of
the
troubles
of
early
youth
a
secret
easily
guessed
by
an
old
father
suddenly
julie
s
face
flushed
and
she
uttered
an
exclamation
neither
her
father
nor
the
sentinels
understood
the
meaning
of
the
cry
but
an
officer
within
the
barrier
who
sprang
across
the
court
towards
the
staircase
heard
it
and
turned
abruptly
at
the
sound
he
went
to
the
arcade
by
the
gardens
of
the
tuileries
and
recognized
the
young
lady
who
had
been
hidden
for
a
moment
by
the
tall
bearskin
caps
of
the
grenadiers
he
set
aside
in
favor
of
the
pair
the
order
which
he
himself
had
given
then
taking
no
heed
of
the
murmurings
of
the
fashionable
crowd
seated
under
the
arcade
he
gently
drew
the
enraptured
child
towards
him
i
am
no
longer
surprised
at
her
vexation
and
enthusiasm
if
are
in
waiting
the
old
man
said
with
a
glance
at
the
officer
if
you
want
a
good
position
le
duc
the
young
man
answered
we
must
not
spend
any
time
in
talking
the
emperor
does
not
like
to
be
kept
waiting
and
the
grand
marshal
has
sent
me
to
announce
our
as
he
spoke
he
had
taken
julie
s
arm
with
a
certain
air
of
old
acquaintance
and
drew
her
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
the
place
du
carrousel
julie
was
astonished
at
the
sight
an
immense
crowd
was
penned
up
in
a
narrow
space
shut
in
between
the
gray
walls
of
the
palace
and
the
limits
marked
out
by
chains
round
the
great
sanded
squares
in
the
midst
of
the
courtyard
of
the
tuileries
the
cordon
of
sentries
posted
to
keep
a
clear
passage
for
the
emperor
and
his
staff
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
back
the
eager
humming
swarm
of
human
beings
is
it
going
to
be
a
very
fine
sight
julie
asked
she
was
radiant
now
pray
take
care
cried
her
guide
and
seizing
julie
by
the
waist
he
lifted
her
up
with
as
much
vigor
as
rapidity
and
set
her
down
beside
a
pillar
but
for
his
prompt
action
his
gazing
kinswoman
would
have
come
into
collision
with
the
hindquarters
of
a
white
horse
which
napoleon
s
mameluke
held
by
the
bridle
the
animal
in
its
trappings
of
green
velvet
and
gold
stood
almost
under
the
arcade
some
ten
paces
behind
the
rest
of
the
horses
in
readiness
for
the
emperor
s
staff
the
young
officer
placed
the
father
and
daughter
in
front
of
the
crowd
in
the
first
space
to
the
right
and
recommended
them
by
a
sign
to
the
two
veteran
grenadiers
on
either
side
then
he
went
on
his
way
into
the
palace
a
look
of
great
joy
and
happiness
had
succeeded
to
his
expression
when
the
horse
backed
julie
had
given
his
hand
a
mysterious
pressure
had
she
meant
to
thank
him
for
the
little
service
he
had
done
her
or
did
she
tell
him
after
all
i
shall
really
see
you
she
bent
her
head
quite
graciously
in
response
to
the
respectful
bow
by
which
the
officer
took
leave
of
them
before
he
vanished
the
old
man
stood
a
little
behind
his
daughter
he
looked
grave
he
seemed
to
have
left
the
two
young
people
together
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
and
now
he
furtively
watched
the
girl
trying
to
lull
her
into
false
security
by
appearing
to
give
his
whole
attention
to
the
magnificent
sight
in
the
place
du
carrousel
when
julie
s
eyes
turned
to
her
father
with
the
expression
of
a
schoolboy
before
his
master
he
answered
her
glance
by
a
gay
kindly
smile
but
his
own
keen
eyes
had
followed
the
officer
under
the
arcade
and
nothing
of
all
that
passed
was
lost
upon
him
what
a
grand
sight
said
julie
in
a
low
voice
as
she
pressed
her
father
s
hand
and
indeed
the
pomp
and
picturesquesness
of
the
spectacle
in
the
place
du
carrousel
drew
the
same
exclamation
from
thousands
upon
thousands
of
spectators
all
agape
with
wonder
another
array
of
sightseers
as
tightly
packed
as
the
ranks
behind
the
old
noble
and
his
daughter
filled
the
narrow
strip
of
pavement
by
the
railings
which
crossed
the
place
du
carrousel
from
side
to
side
in
a
line
parallel
with
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
the
dense
living
mass
variegated
by
the
colors
of
the
women
s
dresses
traced
out
a
bold
line
across
the
centre
of
the
place
du
carrousel
filling
in
the
fourth
side
of
a
vast
parallelogram
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
the
palace
of
the
tuileries
itself
within
the
precincts
thus
railed
off
stood
the
regiments
of
the
old
guard
about
to
be
passed
in
review
drawn
up
opposite
the
palace
in
imposing
blue
columns
ten
ranks
in
depth
without
and
beyond
in
the
place
du
carrousel
stood
several
regiments
likewise
drawn
up
in
parallel
lines
ready
to
march
in
through
the
arch
in
the
centre
the
triumphal
arch
where
the
bronze
horses
of
mark
from
venice
used
to
stand
in
those
days
at
either
end
by
the
galeries
du
louvre
the
regimental
bands
were
stationed
masked
by
the
polish
lancers
then
on
duty
the
greater
part
of
the
vast
graveled
space
was
empty
as
an
arena
ready
for
the
evolutions
of
those
silent
masses
disposed
with
the
symmetry
of
military
art
the
sunlight
blazed
back
from
ten
thousand
bayonets
in
thin
points
of
flame
the
breeze
ruffled
the
men
s
helmet
plumes
till
they
swayed
like
the
crests
of
before
a
gale
the
mute
glittering
ranks
of
veterans
were
full
of
bright
contrasting
colors
thanks
to
their
different
uniforms
weapons
accoutrements
and
aiguillettes
and
the
whole
great
picture
that
miniature
battlefield
before
the
combat
was
framed
by
the
majestic
towering
walls
of
the
tuileries
which
officers
and
men
seemed
to
rival
in
their
immobility
involuntarily
the
spectator
made
the
comparison
between
the
walls
of
men
and
the
walls
of
stone
the
spring
sunlight
flooding
white
masonry
reared
but
yesterday
and
buildings
centuries
old
shone
full
likewise
upon
thousands
of
bronzed
faces
each
one
with
its
own
tale
of
perils
passed
each
one
gravely
expectant
of
perils
to
come
the
colonels
of
the
regiments
came
and
went
alone
before
the
ranks
of
heroes
and
behind
the
masses
of
troops
checkered
with
blue
and
silver
and
gold
and
purple
the
curious
could
discern
the
tricolor
pennons
on
the
lances
of
some
indefatigable
polish
cavalry
rushing
about
like
shepherds
dogs
in
charge
of
a
flock
caracoling
up
and
down
between
the
troops
and
the
crowd
to
keep
the
gazers
within
their
proper
bounds
but
for
this
slight
flutter
of
movement
the
whole
scene
might
have
been
taking
place
in
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
of
the
sleeping
beauty
the
very
spring
breeze
ruffling
up
the
long
fur
on
the
grenadiers
bearskins
bore
witness
to
the
men
s
immobility
as
the
smothered
murmur
of
the
crowd
emphasized
their
silence
now
and
again
the
jingling
of
chinese
bells
or
a
chance
blow
to
a
big
drum
woke
the
reverberating
echoes
of
the
imperial
palace
with
a
sound
like
the
rumblings
of
thunder
an
indescribable
unmistakable
enthusiasm
was
manifest
in
the
expectancy
of
the
multitude
france
was
about
to
take
farewell
of
napoleon
on
the
eve
of
a
campaign
of
which
the
meanest
citizen
foresaw
the
perils
the
existence
of
the
french
empire
was
at
stake
to
be
or
not
to
be
the
whole
citizen
population
seemed
to
be
as
much
inspired
with
this
thought
as
that
other
armed
population
standing
in
serried
and
silent
ranks
in
the
enclosed
space
with
the
eagles
and
the
genius
of
napoleon
hovering
above
them
those
very
soldiers
were
the
hope
of
france
her
last
drop
of
blood
and
this
accounted
for
not
a
little
of
the
anxious
interest
of
the
scene
most
of
the
gazers
in
the
crowd
had
bidden
farewell
perhaps
farewell
for
ever
to
the
men
who
made
up
the
rank
and
file
of
the
battalions
and
even
those
most
hostile
to
the
emperor
in
their
hearts
put
up
fervent
prayers
to
heaven
for
the
glory
of
france
and
those
most
weary
of
the
struggle
with
the
rest
of
europe
had
left
their
hatreds
behind
as
they
passed
in
under
the
triumphal
arch
they
too
felt
that
in
the
hour
of
danger
napoleon
meant
france
herself
the
clock
of
the
tuileries
struck
the
in
a
moment
the
hum
of
the
crowd
ceased
the
silence
was
so
deep
that
you
might
have
heard
a
child
speak
the
old
noble
and
his
daughter
wholly
intent
seeming
to
live
only
by
their
eyes
caught
a
distinct
sound
of
spurs
and
clank
of
swords
echoing
up
under
the
sonorous
peristyle
and
suddenly
there
appeared
a
short
somewhat
stout
figure
in
a
green
uniform
white
trousers
and
riding
boots
a
man
wearing
on
his
head
a
cocked
hat
as
magically
potent
as
its
wearer
the
broad
red
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
rose
and
fell
on
his
breast
and
a
short
sword
hung
at
his
side
at
one
and
the
same
moment
the
man
was
seen
by
all
eyes
in
all
parts
of
the
square
immediately
the
drums
beat
a
salute
both
bands
struck
up
a
martial
refrain
caught
and
repeated
like
a
fugue
by
every
instrument
from
the
thinnest
flutes
to
the
largest
drum
the
clangor
of
that
call
to
arms
thrilled
through
every
soul
the
colors
dropped
and
the
men
presented
arms
one
unanimous
rhythmical
movement
shaking
every
bayonet
from
the
foremost
front
near
the
palace
to
the
last
rank
in
the
place
du
carrousel
the
words
of
command
sped
from
line
to
line
like
echoes
the
whole
enthusiastic
multitude
sent
up
a
shout
of
long
live
the
emperor
everything
shook
quivered
and
thrilled
at
last
napoleon
had
mounted
his
horse
it
was
his
movement
that
had
put
life
into
those
silent
masses
of
men
the
dumb
instruments
had
found
a
voice
at
his
coming
the
eagles
and
the
colors
had
obeyed
the
same
impulse
which
had
brought
emotion
into
all
faces
the
very
walls
of
the
high
galleries
of
the
old
palace
seemed
to
cry
aloud
long
live
the
emperor
there
was
something
preternatural
about
it
it
was
magic
at
work
a
counterfeit
presentment
of
the
power
of
god
or
rather
it
was
a
fugitive
image
of
a
reign
itself
so
fugitive
and
the
centre
of
such
love
such
enthusiasm
and
devotion
and
so
many
prayers
he
for
whom
the
sun
had
driven
the
clouds
from
the
sky
was
sitting
there
on
his
horse
three
paces
in
front
of
his
golden
squadron
with
the
grand
marshal
on
his
left
and
the
on
his
right
amid
all
the
outburst
of
enthusiasm
at
his
presence
not
a
feature
of
his
face
appeared
to
alter
oh
yes
at
wagram
in
the
thick
of
the
firing
on
the
field
of
borodino
among
the
dead
always
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
is
said
the
grenadier
in
answer
to
the
questions
with
which
the
young
girl
plied
him
for
a
moment
julie
was
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
that
face
so
quiet
in
the
security
of
conscious
power
the
emperor
noticed
mlle
de
chatillonest
and
leaned
to
make
some
brief
remark
to
duroc
which
drew
a
smile
from
the
grand
marshal
then
the
review
began
if
hitherto
the
young
lady
s
attention
had
been
divided
between
napoleon
s
impassive
face
and
the
blue
red
and
green
ranks
of
troops
from
this
time
forth
she
was
wholly
intent
upon
a
young
officer
moving
among
the
lines
as
they
performed
their
swift
symmetrical
evolutions
she
watched
him
gallop
with
tireless
activity
to
and
from
the
group
where
the
plainly
dressed
napoleon
shone
conspicuous
the
officer
rode
a
splendid
black
horse
his
handsome
uniform
marked
him
out
amid
the
variegated
multitude
as
one
of
the
emperor
s
orderly
his
gold
lace
glittered
in
the
sunshine
which
lighted
up
the
aigrette
on
his
tall
narrow
shako
so
that
the
gazer
might
have
compared
him
to
a
or
to
a
visible
spirit
emanating
from
the
emperor
to
infuse
movement
into
those
battalions
whose
swaying
bayonets
flashed
into
flames
for
at
a
mere
glance
from
his
eyes
they
broke
and
gathered
again
surging
to
and
fro
like
the
waves
in
a
bay
or
again
swept
before
him
like
the
long
ridges
of
wave
which
the
vexed
ocean
directs
against
the
shore
when
the
manoeuvres
were
over
the
officer
galloped
back
at
full
speed
pulled
up
his
horse
and
awaited
orders
he
was
not
ten
paces
from
julie
as
he
stood
before
the
emperor
much
as
general
rapp
stands
in
gerard
s
of
the
young
girl
could
behold
her
lover
in
all
his
soldierly
splendor
colonel
victor
d
aiglemont
barely
thirty
years
of
age
was
tall
slender
and
well
made
his
figure
never
showed
to
better
advantage
than
now
as
he
exerted
his
strength
to
hold
in
the
restive
animal
whose
back
seemed
to
curve
gracefully
to
the
rider
s
weight
his
brown
masculine
face
possessed
the
indefinable
charm
of
perfectly
regular
features
combined
with
youth
the
fiery
eyes
under
the
broad
forehead
shaded
by
thick
eyebrows
and
long
lashes
looked
like
white
ovals
bordered
by
an
outline
of
black
his
nose
had
the
delicate
curve
of
an
eagle
s
beak
the
sinuous
lines
of
the
inevitable
black
moustache
enhanced
the
crimson
of
the
lips
the
brown
and
tawny
shades
which
overspread
the
wide
cheeks
told
a
tale
of
unusual
vigor
and
his
whole
face
bore
the
impress
of
dashing
courage
he
was
the
very
model
which
french
artists
seek
for
the
typical
hero
of
imperial
france
the
horse
which
he
rode
was
covered
with
sweat
the
animal
s
quivering
head
denoted
the
last
degree
of
restiveness
his
hind
hoofs
were
set
down
wide
apart
and
exactly
in
a
line
he
shook
his
long
thick
tail
to
the
wind
in
his
fidelity
to
his
master
he
seemed
to
be
a
visible
presentment
of
that
master
s
devotion
to
the
emperor
julie
saw
her
lover
watching
intently
for
the
emperor
s
glances
and
felt
a
momentary
pang
of
jealousy
for
as
yet
he
had
not
given
her
a
look
suddenly
at
a
word
from
his
sovereign
victor
gripped
his
horse
s
flanks
and
set
out
at
a
gallop
but
the
animal
took
fright
at
a
shadow
cast
by
a
post
shied
backed
and
reared
up
so
suddenly
that
his
rider
was
all
but
thrown
off
julie
cried
out
her
face
grew
white
people
looked
at
her
curiously
but
she
saw
no
one
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
too
mettlesome
beast
the
officer
gave
the
horse
a
sharp
admonitory
cut
with
the
whip
and
galloped
off
with
napoleon
s
order
julie
was
so
absorbed
so
dizzy
with
sights
and
sounds
that
unconsciously
she
clung
to
her
father
s
arm
so
tightly
that
he
could
read
her
thoughts
by
the
varying
pressure
of
her
fingers
when
victor
was
all
but
flung
out
of
the
saddle
she
clutched
her
father
with
a
convulsive
grip
as
if
she
herself
were
in
danger
of
falling
and
the
old
man
looked
at
his
daughter
s
face
with
dark
and
painful
anxiety
pity
jealousy
something
even
of
regret
stole
across
every
drawn
and
wrinkled
line
of
mouth
and
brow
when
he
saw
the
unwonted
light
in
julie
s
eyes
when
that
cry
broke
from
her
when
the
convulsive
grasp
of
her
fingers
drew
away
the
veil
and
put
him
in
possession
of
her
secret
then
with
that
revelation
of
her
love
there
came
surely
some
swift
revelation
of
the
future
mournful
forebodings
could
be
read
in
his
own
face
julie
s
soul
seemed
at
that
moment
to
have
passed
into
the
officer
s
being
a
torturing
thought
more
cruel
than
any
previous
dread
contracted
the
old
man
s
painworn
features
as
he
saw
the
glance
of
understanding
that
passed
between
the
soldier
and
julie
the
girl
s
eyes
were
wet
her
cheeks
glowed
with
unwonted
color
her
father
turned
abruptly
and
led
her
away
into
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
why
father
she
cried
there
are
still
the
regiments
in
the
place
du
carrousel
to
be
passed
in
no
child
all
the
troops
are
marching
i
think
you
are
mistaken
father
d
aiglemont
surely
told
them
to
advance
but
i
feel
ill
my
child
and
i
do
not
care
to
julie
could
readily
believe
the
words
when
she
glanced
at
his
face
he
looked
quite
worn
out
by
his
fatherly
anxieties
are
you
feeling
very
ill
she
asked
indifferently
her
mind
was
so
full
of
other
thoughts
every
day
is
a
reprieve
for
me
is
it
not
returned
her
father
now
do
you
mean
to
make
me
miserable
again
by
talking
about
your
death
i
was
in
such
spirits
do
pray
get
rid
of
those
horrid
gloomy
ideas
of
the
father
heaved
a
sigh
ah
spoiled
child
he
cried
the
best
hearts
are
sometimes
very
cruel
we
devote
our
whole
lives
to
you
you
are
our
one
thought
we
plan
for
your
welfare
sacrifice
our
tastes
to
your
whims
idolize
you
give
the
very
blood
in
our
veins
for
you
and
all
this
is
nothing
is
it
alas
yes
you
take
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
if
we
would
always
have
your
smiles
and
your
disdainful
love
we
should
need
the
power
of
god
in
heaven
then
comes
another
a
lover
a
husband
and
steals
away
your
julie
looked
in
amazement
at
her
father
he
walked
slowly
along
and
there
was
no
light
in
the
eyes
which
he
turned
upon
her
you
hide
yourself
even
from
us
he
continued
but
perhaps
also
you
hide
yourself
from
yourself
what
do
you
mean
by
that
father
i
think
that
you
have
secrets
from
me
you
love
he
went
on
quickly
as
he
saw
the
color
rise
to
her
face
oh
i
hoped
that
you
would
stay
with
your
old
father
until
he
died
i
hoped
to
keep
you
with
me
still
radiant
and
happy
to
admire
you
as
you
were
but
so
lately
so
long
as
i
knew
nothing
of
your
future
i
could
believe
in
a
happy
lot
for
you
but
now
i
can
not
possibly
take
away
with
me
a
hope
of
happiness
for
your
life
for
you
love
the
colonel
even
more
than
the
cousin
i
can
no
longer
doubt
and
why
should
i
be
forbidden
to
love
him
asked
julie
with
lively
curiosity
in
her
face
ah
my
julie
you
would
not
understand
me
sighed
the
father
tell
me
all
the
same
said
julie
with
an
involuntary
petulant
gesture
very
well
child
listen
to
me
girls
are
apt
to
imagine
noble
and
enchanting
and
totally
imaginary
figures
in
their
own
minds
they
have
fanciful
extravagant
ideas
about
men
and
sentiment
and
life
and
then
they
innocently
endow
somebody
or
other
with
all
the
perfections
of
their
and
put
their
trust
in
him
they
fall
in
love
with
this
imaginary
creature
in
the
man
of
their
choice
and
then
when
it
is
too
late
to
escape
from
their
fate
behold
their
first
idol
the
illusion
made
fair
with
their
fancies
turns
to
an
odious
skeleton
julie
i
would
rather
have
you
fall
in
love
with
an
old
man
than
with
the
colonel
ah
if
you
could
but
see
things
from
the
standpoint
of
ten
years
hence
you
would
admit
that
my
old
experience
was
right
i
know
what
victor
is
that
gaiety
of
his
is
simply
animal
spirits
the
gaiety
of
the
barracks
he
has
no
ability
and
he
is
a
spendthrift
he
is
one
of
those
men
whom
heaven
created
to
eat
and
digest
four
meals
a
day
to
sleep
to
fall
in
love
with
the
first
woman
that
comes
to
hand
and
to
fight
he
does
not
understand
life
his
kind
heart
for
he
has
a
kind
heart
will
perhaps
lead
him
to
give
his
purse
to
a
sufferer
or
to
a
comrade
he
is
careless
he
has
not
the
delicacy
of
heart
which
makes
us
slaves
to
a
woman
s
happiness
he
is
ignorant
he
is
selfish
there
are
plenty
of
but
father
he
must
surely
be
clever
he
must
have
ability
or
he
would
not
be
a
colonel
my
dear
victor
will
be
a
colonel
all
his
i
have
seen
no
one
who
appears
to
me
to
be
worthy
of
you
the
old
father
added
with
a
kind
of
enthusiasm
he
paused
an
instant
looked
at
his
daughter
and
added
why
my
poor
julie
you
are
still
too
young
too
fragile
too
delicate
for
the
cares
and
rubs
of
married
life
d
aiglemont
s
relations
have
spoiled
him
just
as
your
mother
and
i
have
spoiled
you
what
hope
is
there
that
you
two
could
agree
with
two
imperious
wills
diametrically
opposed
to
each
other
you
will
be
either
the
tyrant
or
the
victim
and
either
alternative
means
for
a
wife
an
equal
sum
of
misfortune
but
you
are
modest
and
you
would
yield
from
the
first
in
short
he
added
in
a
quivering
voice
there
is
a
grace
of
feeling
in
you
which
would
never
be
valued
and
then
he
broke
off
for
the
tears
overcame
him
victor
will
give
you
pain
through
all
the
girlish
qualities
of
your
young
nature
he
went
on
after
a
pause
i
know
what
soldiers
are
my
julie
i
have
been
in
the
army
in
a
man
of
that
kind
love
very
seldom
gets
the
better
of
old
habits
due
partly
to
the
miseries
amid
which
soldiers
live
partly
to
the
risks
they
run
in
a
life
of
then
you
mean
to
cross
my
inclinations
do
you
father
asked
julie
half
in
earnest
half
in
jest
am
i
to
marry
to
please
you
and
not
to
please
myself
to
please
me
cried
her
father
with
a
start
of
surprise
to
please
child
when
you
will
not
hear
the
voice
that
upbraids
you
so
tenderly
very
much
longer
but
i
have
always
heard
children
impute
personal
motives
for
the
sacrifices
that
their
parents
make
for
them
marry
victor
my
julie
some
day
you
will
bitterly
deplore
his
ineptitude
his
thriftless
ways
his
selfishness
his
lack
of
delicacy
his
inability
to
understand
love
and
countless
troubles
arising
through
him
then
remember
that
here
under
these
trees
your
old
father
s
prophetic
voice
sounded
in
your
ears
in
he
said
no
more
he
had
detected
a
rebellious
shake
of
the
head
on
his
daughter
s
part
both
made
several
paces
towards
the
carriage
which
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
grating
during
that
interval
of
silence
the
young
girl
stole
a
glance
at
her
father
s
face
and
little
by
little
her
sullen
brow
cleared
the
intense
pain
visible
on
his
bowed
forehead
made
a
lively
impression
upon
her
father
she
began
in
gentle
tremulous
tones
i
promise
to
say
no
more
about
victor
until
you
have
overcome
your
prejudices
against
the
old
man
looked
at
her
in
amazement
two
tears
which
filled
his
eyes
overflowed
down
his
withered
cheeks
he
could
not
take
julie
in
his
arms
in
that
crowded
place
but
he
pressed
her
hand
tenderly
a
few
minutes
later
when
they
had
taken
their
places
in
the
cabriolet
all
the
anxious
thought
which
had
gathered
about
his
brow
had
completely
disappeared
julie
s
pensive
attitude
gave
him
far
less
concern
than
the
innocent
joy
which
had
betrayed
her
secret
during
the
review
nearly
a
year
had
passed
since
the
emperor
s
last
review
in
early
march
a
caleche
was
rolling
along
the
highroad
from
amboise
to
tours
as
the
carriage
came
out
from
beneath
the
aisle
of
walnut
trees
by
the
of
la
frilliere
the
horses
dashed
forward
with
such
speed
that
in
a
moment
they
gained
the
bridge
built
across
the
cise
at
the
point
of
its
confluence
with
the
loire
there
however
they
come
to
a
sudden
stand
one
of
the
traces
had
given
way
in
consequence
of
the
furious
pace
at
which
the
obedient
to
his
orders
had
urged
on
four
horses
the
most
vigorous
of
their
breed
chance
therefore
gave
the
two
recently
awakened
occupants
of
the
carriage
an
opportunity
of
seeing
one
of
the
most
lovely
landscapes
along
the
enchanting
banks
of
the
loire
and
that
at
their
full
leisure
at
a
glance
the
travelers
could
see
to
the
right
the
whole
winding
course
of
the
cise
meandering
like
a
silver
snake
among
the
meadows
where
the
grass
had
taken
the
deep
bright
green
of
early
spring
to
the
left
lay
the
loire
in
all
its
glory
a
chill
morning
breeze
ruffling
the
surface
of
the
stately
river
had
fretted
the

caught
the
gleams
of

sun
so
that
the
green
islets
here
and
there
in
its
course
shone
like
gems
set
in
a
gold
necklace
on
the
opposite

the

rich
meadows
of

away

could
see
the

on

itself
framed
by
the
trees
on
the
islands
in
a
setting
of
spring
leaves
seemed
to
rise
like
venice
out
of
the
waters
and
her
old
cathedral
towers
soaring
in
air
were
blended
with
the
pale
fantastic
cloud
shapes
in
the
sky
over
the
side
of
the
bridge
where
the
carriage
had
come
to
a
stand
the
traveler
looks
along
a
line
of
cliffs
stretching
as
far
as
tours
nature
in
some
freakish
mood
must
have
raised
these
barriers
of
rock
undermined
incessantly
by
the
rippling
loire
at
their
feet
for
a
perpetual
wonder
for
spectators
the
village
of
vouvray
nestles
as
it
were
among
the
clefts
and
crannies
of
the
crags
which
begin
to
describe
a
bend
at
the
junction
of
the
loire
and
cise
a
whole
population
of
lives
in
fact
in
appalling
insecurity
in
holes
in
their
jagged
sides
for
the
whole
way
between
vouvray
and
tours
in
some
places
there
are
three
tiers
of
dwellings
hollowed
out
one
above
the
other
in
the
rock
each
row
communicating
with
the
next
by
dizzy
staircases
cut
likewise
in

cliff
a
little
girl
in
a
short
red
petticoat
runs
out
into
her
garden
on
the
roof
of
another
dwelling
you
can
watch
a
wreath
of
curling
up
among
the
shoots
and
trails
of
the
vines
men
are
at
work
in
their
almost
perpendicular
patches
of
ground
an
old
woman
sits
tranquilly
spinning
under
a
blossoming
almond
tree
on
a
crumbling
mass
of
rock
and
smiles
down
on
the
dismay
of
the
travelers
far
below
her
feet
the
cracks
in
the
ground
trouble
her
as
little
as
the
precarious
state
of
the
old
wall
a
pendant
mass
of
loose
stones
only
kept
in
position
by
the
crooked
stems
of
its
ivy
mantle
the
sound
of
coopers
mallets
rings
through
the
skyey

here
where
nature
stints
human
industry
of

the
soil
is
everywhere
tilled
and
everywhere
fertile
no

along
the
whole
course
of
the
loire
can
compare
with
the
rich
landscape
of
touraine
here
outspread
beneath
the
traveler
s
eyes
the
triple
picture
thus
barely
sketched
in
outline
is
one
of
those
scenes
which
the
imagination
engraves
for
ever
upon
the
memory
let
a
poet
fall
under
its
charm
and
he
shall
be
haunted
by
visions
which
shall
reproduce
its
romantic
loveliness
out
of
the
vague
substance
of
dreams
as
the
carriage
stopped
on
the
bridge
over
the
cise
white
sails
came
out
here
and
there
from
among
the
islands
in
the
loire
to
add
new
grace
to
the
perfect
view
the
subtle
scent
of
the
willows
by
the
water
s
edge
was
mingled
with
the
damp
odor
of
the
breeze
from
the
river
the
monotonous
chant
of
a
added
a
plaintive
note
to
the
sound
of
birds
songs
in
a
chorus
which
never
ends
the
cries
of
the
boatmen
brought
tidings
of
distant
busy
life
here
was
touraine
in
all
its
glory
and
the
very
height
of
the
splendor
of
spring
here
was
the
one
peaceful
district
in
france
in
those
troublous
days
for
it
was
so
unlikely
that
a
foreign
army
should
trouble
its
quiet
that
touraine
might
be
said
to
defy
invasion
as
soon
as
the
caleche
stopped
a
head
covered
with
a
foraging
cap
was
put
out
of
the
window
and
soon
afterwards
an
impatient
military
man
flung
open
the
carriage
door
and
sprang
down
into
the
road
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
the
postilion
but
the
skill
with
which
the
tourangeau
was
repairing
the
trace
restored
colonel
d
aiglemont
s
equanimity
he
went
back
to
the
carriage
stretched
himself
to
relieve
his
benumbed
muscles
yawned
looked
about
him
and
finally
laid
a
hand
on
the
arm
of
a
young
woman
warmly
wrapped
up
in
a
furred
pelisse
come
julie
he
said
hoarsely
just
wake
up
and
take
a
look
at
this
country
it
is
julie
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
she
wore
a
traveling
cap
of
sable
fur
nothing
could
be
seen
of
her
but
her
face
for
the
whole
of
her
person
was
completely
concealed
by
the
folds
of
her
fur
pelisse
the
young
girl
who
tripped
to
the
review
at
the
tuileries
with
light
footsteps
and
joy
and
gladness
in
her
heart
was
scarcely
recognizable
in
julie
d
aiglemont
her
face
delicate
as
ever
had
lost
the
which
once
gave
it
so
rich
a
glow
a
few
straggling
locks
of
black
hair
straightened
out
by
the
damp
night
air
enhanced
its
dead
whiteness
and
all
its
life
and
sparkle
seemed
to
be
torpid
yet
her
eyes
glittered
with
preternatural
brightness
in
spite
of
the
violet
shadows
under
the
lashes
upon
her
wan
cheeks
she
looked
out
with
indifferent
eyes
over
the
fields
towards
the
cher
at
the
islands
in
the
river
at
the
line
of
the
crags
of
vouvray
stretching
along
the
loire
towards
tours
then
she
sank
back
as
soon
as
possible
into
her
seat
in
the
caleche
she
did
not
care
to
give
a
glance
to
the
enchanting
valley
of
the
cise
yes
it
is
wonderful
she
said
and
out
in
the
open
air
her
voice
sounded
weak
and
faint
to
the
last
degree
evidently
she
had
had
her
way
with
her
father
to
her
misfortune
would
you
not
like
to
live
here
julie
yes
here
or
anywhere
she
answered
listlessly
do
you
feel
ill
asked
colonel
d
aiglemont
no
not
at
all
she
answered
with
momentary
energy
and
smiling
at
her
husband
she
added
i
should
like
to
go
to
suddenly
there
came
a
sound
of
a
horse
galloping
towards
them
victor
d
aiglemont
dropped
his
wife
s
hand
and
turned
to
watch
the
bend
in
the
road
no
sooner
had
he
taken
his
eyes
from
julie
s
pale
face
than
all
the
assumed
gaiety
died
out
of
it
it
was
as
if
a
light
had
been
extinguished
she
felt
no
wish
to
look
at
the
landscape
no
curiosity
to
see
the
horseman
who
was
galloping
towards
them
at
such
a
furious
pace
and
ensconcing
herself
in
her
corner
stared
out
before
her
at
the
hindquarters
of
the
looking
as
blank
as
any
breton
peasant
listening
to
his
sermon
suddenly
a
young
man
riding
a
valuable
horse
came
out
from
behind
the
clump
of
poplars
and
flowering
it
is
an
englishman
remarked
the
colonel
lord
bless
you
yes
general
said
the
he
belongs
to
the
race
of
fellows
who
have
a
mind
to
gobble
up
france
they
the
stranger
was
one
of
the
foreigners
traveling
in
france
at
the
time
when
napoleon
detained
all
british
subjects
within
the
limits
of
the
empire
by
way
of
reprisals
for
the
violation
of
the
treaty
of
amiens
an
outrage
of
international
law
perpetrated
by
the
court
of
james
these
prisoners
compelled
to
submit
to
the
emperor
s
pleasure
were
not
all
suffered
to
remain
in
the
houses
where
they
were
arrested
nor
yet
in
the
places
of
residence
which
at
first
they
were
permitted
to
choose
most
of
the
english
colony
in
touraine
had
been
transplanted
thither
from
different
places
where
their
presence
was
supposed
to
be
inimical
to
the
interests
of
the
continental
policy
the
young
man
who
was
taking
the
tedium
of
the
early
morning
hours
on
horseback
was
one
of
these
victims
of
bureaucratic
tyranny
two
years
previously
a
sudden
order
from
the
foreign
office
had
dragged
him
from
montpellier
whither
he
had
gone
on
account
of
consumptive
tendencies
he
glanced
at
the
comte
d
aiglemont
saw
that
he
was
a
military
man
and
deliberately
looked
away
turning
his
head
somewhat
abruptly
towards
the
meadows
by
the
cise
the
english
are
all
as
insolent
as
if
the
globe
belonged
to
them
muttered
the
colonel
luckily
soult
will
give
them
a
thrashing
the
prisoner
gave
a
glance
to
the
caleche
as
he
rode
by
brief
though
that
glance
was
he
had
yet
time
to
notice
the
sad
expression
which
lent
an
indefinable
charm
to
the
countess
pensive
face
many
men
are
deeply
moved
by
the
mere
semblance
of
suffering
in
a
woman
they
take
the
look
of
pain
for
a
sign
of
constancy
or
of
love
julie
herself
was
so
much
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
the
opposite
cushion
that
she
saw
neither
the
horse
nor
the
rider
the
damaged
trace
meanwhile
had
been
quickly
and
strongly
repaired
the
count
stepped
into
his
place
again
and
the
doing
his
best
to
make
up
for
lost
time
drove
the
carriage
rapidly
along
the
embankment
on
they
drove
under
the
overhanging
cliffs
with
their
picturesque
huts
and
stores
of
wine
maturing
in
their
dark
sides
till
in
the
distance
uprose
the
spire
of
the
famous
abbey
of
marmoutiers
the
retreat
of
martin
what
can
that
diaphanous
milord
want
with
us
exclaimed
the
colonel
turning
to
assure
himself
that
the
horseman
who
had
followed
them
from
the
bridge
was
the
young
englishman
after
all
the
stranger
committed
no
breach
of
good
manners
by
riding
along
on
the
footway
and
colonel
d
aiglemont
was
fain
to
lie
back
in
his
corner
after
sending
a
scowl
in
the
englishman
s
direction
but
in
spite
of
his
hostile
instincts
he
could
not
help
noticing
the
beauty
of
the
animal
and
the
graceful
horsemanship
of
the
rider
the
young
man
s
face
was
of
that
pale
insular
type
which
is
almost
girlish
in
the
softness
and
delicacy
of
its
color
and
texture
he
was
tall
thin
and
dressed
with
the
extreme
and
elaborate
neatness
characteristic
of
a
man
of
fashion
in
prudish
england
any
one
might
have
thought
that
bashfulness
rather
than
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
the
countess
had
called
up
that
flush
into
his
face
once
only
julie
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
at
the
stranger
and
then
only
because
she
was
in
a
manner
compelled
to
do
so
for
her
husband
called
upon
her
to
admire
the
action
of
the
thoroughbred
it
so
happened
that
their
glances
clashed
and
the
shy
englishman
instead
of
riding
abreast
of
the
carriage
fell
behind
on
this
and
followed
them
at
a
distance
of
a
few
paces
yet
the
countess
had
scarcely
given
him
a
glance
she
saw
none
of
the
various
perfections
human
and
equine
commended
to
her
notice
and
fell
back
again
in
the
carriage
with
a
slight
movement
of
the
eyelids
intended
to
express
her
acquiescence
in
her
husband
s
views
the
colonel
fell
asleep
again
and
both
husband
and
wife
reached
tours
without
another
word
not
one
of
those
enchanting
views
of
everchanging
landscape
through
which
they
sped
had
drawn
so
much
as
a
glance
from
julie
s
eyes
mme
d
aiglemont
looked
now
and
again
at
her
sleeping
husband
while
she
looked
a
sudden
jolt
shook
something
down
upon
her
knees
it
was
her
father
s
portrait
a
miniature
which
she
wore
suspended
about
her
neck
by
a
black
cord
at
the
sight
of
it
the
tears
till
then
kept
back
overflowed
her
eyes
but
no
one
save
perhaps
the
englishman
saw
them
glitter
there
for
a
brief
moment
before
they
dried
upon
her
pale
cheeks
colonel
d
aiglemont
was
on
his
way
to
the
south
marshal
soult
was
repelling
an
english
invasion
of
bearn
and
d
aiglemont
the
bearer
of
the
emperor
s
orders
to
the
marshal
seized
the
opportunity
of
taking
his
wife
as
far
as
tours
to
leave
her
with
an
elderly
relative
of
his
own
far
away
from
the
dangers
threatening
paris
very
shortly
the
carriage
rolled
over
the
paved
road
of
tours
over
the
bridge
along
the
and
stopped
at
last
before
the
old
mansion
of
the
marquise
de
the
marquise
de
with
her
white
hair
pale
face
and
shrewd
smile
was
one
of
those
fine
old
ladies
who
still
seem
to
wear
the
paniers
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
affects
caps
of
an
extinct
mode
they
are
nearly
always
caressing
in
their
manners
as
if
the
heyday
of
love
still
lingered
on
for
these
septuagenarian
portraits
of
the
age
of
louis
quinze
with
the
faint
perfume
of
a
la
always
clinging
about
them
bigoted
rather
than
pious
and
less
of
bigots
than
they
seem
women
who
can
tell
a
story
well
and
talk
still
better
their
laughter
comes
more
readily
for
an
old
memory
than
for
a
new
jest
the
present
intrudes
upon
them
when
an
old
announced
to
the
marquise
de
to
give
her
the
title
which
she
was
soon
to
resume
the
arrival
of
a
nephew
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
the
outbreak
of
the
war
with
spain
the
old
lady
took
off
her
spectacles
with
alacrity
shut
the
de
l
ancienne
her
favorite
work
and
recovered
something
like
youthful
activity
hastening
out
upon
the
flight
of
steps
to
greet
the
young
couple
there
aunt
and
niece
exchanged
a
rapid
glance
of
survey
dear
aunt
cried
the
colonel
giving
the
old
lady
a
hasty
embrace
i
am
bringing
a
young
lady
to
put
under
your
wing
i
have
come
to
put
my
treasure
in
your
keeping
my
julie
is
neither
jealous
nor
a
coquette
she
is
as
good
as
an
angel
i
hope
that
she
will
not
be
spoiled
here
he
added
suddenly
interrupting
himself
scapegrace
returned
the
marquise
with
a
satirical
glance
at
her
nephew
she
did
not
wait
for
her
niece
to
approach
her
but
with
a
certain
kindly
graciousness
went
forward
herself
to
kiss
julie
who
stood
there
thoughtfully
to
all
appearance
more
embarrassed
than
curious
concerning
her
new
relation
so
we
are
to
make
each
other
s
acquaintance
are
we
my
love
the
marquise
continued
do
not
be
too
much
alarmed
of
me
i
always
try
not
to
be
an
old
woman
with
young
on
the
way
to
the
the
marquise
ordered
breakfast
for
her
guests
in
provincial
fashion
but
the
count
checked
his
aunt
s
flow
of
words
by
saying
soberly
that
he
could
only
remain
in
the
house
while
the
horses
were
changing
on
this
the
three
hurried
into
the
the
colonel
had
barely
time
to
tell
the
story
of
the
political
and
military
events
which
had
compelled
him
to
ask
his
aunt
for
a
shelter
for
his
young
wife
while
he
talked
on
without
interruption
the
older
lady
looked
from
her
nephew
to
her
niece
and
took
the
sadness
in
julie
s
white
face
for
grief
at
the
enforced
separation
eh
eh
her
looks
seemed
to
say
these
young
things
are
in
love
with
each
the
crack
of
the
postilion
s
whip
sounded
outside
in
the
silent
old
courtyard
victor
embraced
his
aunt
once
more
and
rushed
out
dear
he
said
kissing
his
wife
who
had
followed
him
down
to
the
carriage
oh
victor
let
me
come
still
further
with
you
she
pleaded
coaxingly
i
do
not
want
to
leave
you
can
you
seriously
mean
it
very
well
said
julie
since
you
wish
the
carriage
disappeared
so
you
are
very
fond
of
my
poor
victor
said
the
marquise
interrogating
her
niece
with
one
of
those
sagacious
glances
which
dowagers
give
younger
women
alas
madame
said
julie
must
one
not
love
a
man
well
indeed
to
marry
him
the
words
were
spoken
with
an
artless
accent
which
revealed
either
a
pure
heart
or
inscrutable
depths
how
could
a
woman
who
had
been
the
friend
of
duclos
and
the
marechal
de
richelieu
refrain
from
trying
to
read
the
riddle
of
this
marriage
aunt
and
niece
were
standing
on
the
steps
gazing
after
the
fast
vanishing
caleche
the
look
in
the
young
countess
eyes
did
not
mean
love
as
the
marquise
understood
it
the
good
lady
was
a
provencale
and
her
passions
had
been
lively
so
you
were
captivated
by
my
of
a
nephew
she
asked
involuntarily
julie
shuddered
something
in
the
experienced
coquette
s
look
and
tone
seemed
to
say
that
mme
de
s
knowledge
of
her
husband
s
character
went
perhaps
deeper
than
his
wife
s
mme
d
aiglemont
in
dismay
took
refuge
in
this
transparent
dissimulation
ready
to
her
hand
the
first
resource
of
an
artless
unhappiness
mme
de
listomere
appeared
to
be
satisfied
with
julie
s
answers
but
in
her
secret
heart
she
rejoiced
to
think
that
here
was
a
love
affair
on
hand
to
enliven
her
solitude
for
that
her
niece
had
some
amusing
flirtation
on
foot
she
was
fully
convinced
in
the
great
hung
with
tapestry
framed
in
strips
of
gilding
young
mme
d
aiglemont
sat
before
a
blazing
fire
behind
a
chinese
screen
placed
to
shut
out
the
cold
draughts
from
the
window
and
her
heavy
mood
scarcely
lightened
among
the
old
furniture
under
the
old
paneled
ceiling
it
was
not
very
easy
to
be
gay
yet
the
young
parisienne
took
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
this
entrance
upon
a
life
of
complete
solitude
and
in
the
solemn
silence
of
the
old
provincial
house
she
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
aunt
a
stranger
to
whom
she
had
written
a
bride
s
letter
on
her
marriage
and
then
sat
as
silent
as
if
she
had
been
listening
to
an
opera
not
until
two
hours
had
been
spent
in
an
atmosphere
of
quiet
befitting
la
trappe
did
she
suddenly
awaken
to
a
sense
of
uncourteous
behavior
and
bethink
herself
of
the
short
answers
which
she
had
given
her
aunt
mme
de
listomere
with
the
gracious
tact
characteristic
of
a
bygone
age
had
respected
her
niece
s
mood
when
mme
d
aiglemont
became
conscious
of
her
shortcomings
the
dowager
sat
knitting
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
several
times
left
the
room
to
superintend
preparations
in
the
green
chamber
whither
the
countess
luggage
had
been
transported
now
however
she
had
returned
to
her
great
armchair
and
stole
a
glance
from
time
to
time
at
this
young
relative
julie
felt
ashamed
of
giving
way
to
irresistible
broodings
and
tried
to
earn
her
pardon
by
laughing
at
herself
my
dear
child
know
the
sorrows
of
widowhood
returned
her
aunt
but
only
the
eyes
of
forty
years
could
have
distinguished
the
irony
hovering
about
the
old
lady
s
mouth
next
morning
the
countess
improved
she
talked
mme
de
listomere
no
longer
despaired
of
fathoming
the
wife
whom
yesterday
she
had
set
down
as
a
dull
unsociable
creature
and
discoursed
on
the
delights
of
the
country
of
dances
of
houses
where
they
could
visit
all
that
day
the
marquise
s
questions
were
so
many
snares
it
was
the
old
habit
of
the
old
court
she
could
not
help
setting
traps
to
discover
her
niece
s
character
for
several
days
julie
plied
with
temptations
steadfastly
declined
to
seek
amusement
abroad
and
much
as
the
old
lady
s
pride
longed
to
exhibit
her
pretty
niece
she
was
fain
to
renounce
all
hope
of
taking
her
into
society
for
the
young
countess
was
still
in
morning
for
her
father
and
found
in
her
loss
and
her
mourning
dress
a
pretext
for
her
sadness
and
desire
for
seclusion
by
the
end
of
the
week
the
dowager
admired
julie
s
angelic
sweetness
of
disposition
her
diffident
charm
her
indulgent
temper
and
thenceforward
began
to
take
a
prodigious
interest
in
the
mysterious
sadness
gnawing
at
this
young
heart
the
countess
was
one
of
those
women
who
seem
born
to
be
loved
and
to
bring
happiness
with
them
mme
de
listomere
found
her
niece
s
society
grown
so
sweet
and
precious
that
she
doted
upon
julie
and
could
no
longer
think
of
parting
with
her
a
month
sufficed
to
establish
an
eternal
friendship
between
the
two
ladies
the
dowager
noticed
not
without
surprise
the
changes
that
took
place
in
mme
d
aiglemont
gradually
her
bright
color
died
away
and
her
face
became
dead
white
yet
julie
s
spirits
rose
as
the
bloom
faded
from
her
cheeks
sometimes
the
dowager
s
sallies
provoked
outbursts
of
merriment
or
peals
of
laughter
promptly
repressed
however
by
some
clamorous
thought
mme
de
listomere
had
guessed
by
this
time
that
it
was
neither
victor
s
absence
nor
a
father
s
death
which
threw
a
shadow
over
her
niece
s
life
but
her
mind
was
so
full
of
dark
suspicions
that
she
found
it
difficult
to
lay
a
finger
upon
the
real
cause
of
the
mischief
possibly
truth
is
only
discoverable
by
chance
a
day
came
however
at
length
when
julie
flashed
out
before
her
aunt
s
astonished
eyes
into
a
complete
forgetfulness
of
her
marriage
she
recovered
the
wild
spirits
of
careless
girlhood
mme
de
listomere
then
and
there
made
up
her
mind
to
fathom
the
depths
of
this
soul
for
its
exceeding
simplicity
was
as
inscrutable
as
dissimulation
night
was
falling
the
two
ladies
were
sitting
by
the
window
which
looked
out
upon
the
street
and
julie
was
looking
thoughtful
again
when
some
one
went
by
on
horseback
there
goes
one
of
your
victims
said
the
marquise
mme
d
aiglemont
looked
up
dismay
and
surprise
blended
in
her
face
he
is
a
young
englishman
the
honorable
arthur
ormand
lord
grenville
s
eldest
son
his
history
is
interesting
his
physician
sent
him
to
montpellier
in
it
was
hoped
that
in
that
climate
he
might
recover
from
the
lung
complaint
which
was
gaining
ground
he
was
detained
like
all
his
by
bonaparte
when
war
broke
out
that
monster
can
not
live
without
fighting
the
young
englishman
by
way
of
amusing
himself
took
to
studying
his
own
complaint
which
was
believed
to
be
incurable
by
degrees
he
acquired
a
liking
for
anatomy
and
physic
and
took
quite
a
craze
for
that
kind
of
thing
a
most
extraordinary
taste
in
a
man
of
quality
though
the
regent
certainly
amused
himself
with
chemistry
in
short
monsieur
arthur
made
astonishing
progress
in
his
studies
his
health
did
the
same
under
the
faculty
of
montpellier
he
consoled
his
captivity
and
at
the
same
time
his
cure
was
thoroughly
completed
they
say
that
he
spent
two
whole
years
in
a
cowshed
living
on
cresses
and
the
milk
of
a
cow
brought
from
switzerland
breathing
as
seldom
as
he
could
and
never
speaking
a
word
since
he
come
to
tours
he
has
lived
quite
alone
he
is
as
proud
as
a
peacock
but
you
have
certainly
made
a
conquest
of
him
for
probably
it
is
not
on
my
account
that
he
has
ridden
under
the
window
twice
every
day
since
you
have
been
he
has
certainly
fallen
in
love
with
that
last
phrase
roused
the
countess
like
magic
her
involuntary
start
and
smile
took
the
marquise
by
surprise
so
far
from
showing
a
sign
of
the
instinctive
satisfaction
felt
by
the
most
of
women
when
she
learns
that
she
has
destroyed
the
peace
of
mind
of
some
male
victim
there
was
a
hard
haggard
expression
in
julie
s
face
a
look
of
repulsion
amounting
almost
to
loathing
a
woman
who
loves
will
put
the
whole
world
under
the
ban
of
love
s
empire
for
the
sake
of
the
one
whom
she
loves
but
such
a
woman
can
laugh
and
jest
and
julie
at
that
moment
looked
as
if
the
memory
of
some
recently
escaped
peril
was
too
sharp
and
fresh
not
to
bring
with
it
a
quick
sensation
of
pain
her
aunt
by
this
time
convinced
that
julie
did
not
love
her
nephew
was
stupefied
by
the
discovery
that
she
loved
nobody
else
she
shuddered
lest
a
further
discovery
should
show
her
julie
s
heart
disenchanted
lest
the
experience
of
a
day
or
perhaps
of
a
night
should
have
revealed
to
a
young
wife
the
full
extent
of
victor
s
emptiness
if
she
has
found
him
out
there
is
an
end
of
it
thought
the
dowager
my
nephew
will
soon
be
made
to
feel
the
inconveniences
of
wedded
the
marquise
now
proposed
to
convert
julie
to
the
monarchical
doctrines
of
the
times
of
louis
quinze
but
a
few
hours
later
she
discovered
or
more
properly
speaking
guessed
the
not
uncommon
state
of
affairs
and
the
real
cause
of
her
niece
s
low
spirits
julie
turned
thoughtful
on
a
sudden
and
went
to
her
room
earlier
than
usual
when
her
maid
left
her
for
the
night
she
still
sat
by
the
fire
in
the
yellow
velvet
depths
of
a
great
chair
an
piece
of
furniture
as
well
suited
for
sorrow
as
for
happy
people
tears
flowed
followed
by
sighs
and
meditation
after
a
while
she
drew
a
little
table
to
her
sought
writing
materials
and
began
to
write
the
hours
went
by
swiftly
julie
s
confidences
made
to
the
sheet
of
paper
seemed
to
cost
her
dear
every
sentence
set
her
dreaming
and
at
last
she
suddenly
burst
into
tears
the
clocks
were
striking
two
her
head
grown
heavy
as
a
dying
woman
s
was
bowed
over
her
breast
when
she
raised
it
her
aunt
appeared
before
her
as
suddenly
as
if
she
had
stepped
out
of
the
background
of
tapestry
upon
the
walls
what
can
be
the
matter
with
you
child
asked
the
marquise
why
are
you
sitting
up
so
late
and
why
in
the
first
place
are
you
crying
alone
at
your
age
without
further
ceremony
she
sat
down
beside
her
niece
her
eyes
the
while
devouring
the
unfinished
letter
were
you
writing
to
your
husband
do
i
know
where
he
is
returned
the
countess
her
aunt
thereupon
took
up
the
sheet
and
proceeded
to
read
it
she
had
brought
her
spectacles
the
deed
was
premeditated
the
innocent
writer
of
the
letter
allowed
her
to
take
it
without
the
slightest
remark
it
was
neither
lack
of
dignity
nor
consciousness
of
secret
guilt
which
left
her
thus
without
energy
her
aunt
had
come
in
upon
her
at
a
crisis
she
was
helpless
right
or
wrong
reticence
and
confidence
like
all
things
else
were
matters
of
indifference
like
some
young
maid
who
had
heaped
scorn
upon
her
lover
and
feels
so
lonely
and
sad
when
evening
comes
that
she
longs
for
him
to
come
back
or
for
a
heart
to
which
she
can
pour
out
her
sorrow
julie
allowed
her
aunt
to
violate
the
seal
which
honor
places
upon
an
open
letter
and
sat
musing
while
the
marquise
read
on
my
dear
louisa
why
do
you
ask
so
often
for
the
fulfilment
of
as
rash
a
promise
as
two
young
and
inexperienced
girls
could
make
you
say
that
you
often
ask
yourself
why
i
have
given
no
answer
to
your
questions
for
these
six
months
if
my
silence
told
you
nothing
perhaps
you
will
understand
the
reasons
for
it
as
you
read
the
secrets
which
i
am
about
to
betray
i
should
have
buried
them
for
ever
in
the
depths
of
my
heart
if
you
had
not
announced
your
own
approaching
marriage
you
are
about
to
be
married
louisa
the
thought
makes
me
shiver
poor
little
one
marry
yes
in
a
few
months
time
one
of
the
keenest
pangs
of
regret
will
be
the
recollection
of
a
self
which
used
to
be
of
the
two
young
girls
who
sat
one
evening
under
one
of
the
tallest
on
the
hillside
at
ecouen
and
looked
along
the
fair
valley
at
our
feet
in
the
light
of
the
sunset
which
caught
us
in
its
glow
we
sat
on
a
slab
of
rock
in
ecstasy
which
sobered
down
into
melancholy
of
the
gentlest
you
were
the
first
to
discover
that
the
sun
spoke
to
us
of
the
future
how
inquisitive
and
how
silly
we
were
do
you
remember
all
the
absurd
things
we
said
and
did
we
embraced
each
other
like
lovers
said
we
we
solemnly
promised
that
the
first
bride
should
faithfully
reveal
to
the
other
the
mysteries
of
marriage
the
joys
which
our
childish
minds
imagined
to
be
so
delicious
that
evening
will
complete
your
despair
louisa
in
those
days
you
were
young
and
beautiful
and
careless
if
not
radiantly
happy
a
few
days
of
marriage
and
you
will
be
what
i
am
already
ugly
wretched
and
old
need
i
tell
you
how
proud
i
was
and
how
vain
and
glad
to
be
married
to
colonel
victor
d
aiglemont
and
besides
how
could
i
tell
you
now
for
i
can
not
remember
that
old
self
a
few
moments
turned
my
girlhood
to
a
dream
all
through
the
memorable
day
which
consecrated
a
chain
the
extent
of
which
was
hidden
from
me
my
behavior
was
not
free
from
reproach
once
and
again
my
father
tried
to
repress
my
spirits
the
joy
which
i
showed
so
plainly
was
thought
unbefitting
the
occasion
my
talk
scarcely
innocent
simply
because
i
was
so
innocent
i
played
endless
child
s
tricks
with
my
bridal
veil
my
wreath
my
gown
left
alone
that
night
in
the
room
whither
i
had
been
conducted
in
state
i
planned
a
piece
of
mischief
to
tease
victor
while
i
awaited
his
coming
my
heart
beat
wildly
as
it
used
to
do
when
i
was
a
child
stealing
into
the
on
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
new
year
s
gifts
piled
up
there
in
heaps
when
my
husband
came
in
and
looked
for
me
my
smothered
laughter
ringing
out
from
beneath
the
lace
in
which
i
had
shrouded
myself
was
the
last
outburst
of
the
delicious
merriment
which
brightened
our
games
in
childhood
when
the
dowager
had
finished
reading
the
letter
and
after
such
a
beginning
the
rest
must
have
been
sad
indeed
she
slowly
laid
her
spectacles
on
the
table
put
the
letter
down
beside
them
and
looked
fixedly
at
her
niece
age
had
not
dimmed
the
fire
in
those
green
eyes
as
yet
my
little
girl
she
said
a
married
woman
can
not
write
such
a
letter
as
this
to
a
young
unmarried
woman
it
is
scarcely
proper
so
i
was
thinking
julie
broke
in
upon
her
aunt
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
while
you
were
reading
if
a
dish
at
table
is
not
to
our
taste
there
is
no
occasion
to
disgust
others
with
it
child
the
old
lady
continued
benignly
especially
when
marriage
has
seemed
to
us
all
from
eve
downwards
so
excellent
an
institution
you
have
no
mother
the
countess
trembled
then
she
raised
her
face
meekly
and
said
i
have
missed
my
mother
many
times
already
during
the
past
year
but
i
have
myself
to
blame
i
would
not
listen
to
my
father
he
was
opposed
to
my
marriage
he
disapproved
of
victor
as
a
she
looked
at
her
aunt
the
old
face
was
lighted
up
with
a
kindly
look
and
a
thrill
of
joy
dried
julie
s
tears
she
held
out
her
young
soft
hand
to
the
old
marquise
who
seemed
to
ask
for
it
and
the
understanding
between
the
two
women
was
completed
by
the
close
grasp
of
their
fingers
poor
orphan
child
the
words
came
like
a
final
flash
of
enlightenment
to
julie
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
heard
her
father
s
prophetic
voice
again
your
hands
are
burning
are
they
always
like
this
asked
the
marquise
the
fever
only
left
me
seven
or
eight
days
you
had
a
fever
upon
you
and
said
nothing
about
it
to
me
i
have
had
it
for
a
year
said
julie
with
a
kind
of
timid
anxiety
my
good
little
angel
then
your
married
life
hitherto
has
been
one
long
time
of
suffering
julie
did
not
venture
to
reply
but
an
affirmative
sign
revealed
the
whole
truth
then
you
are
unhappy
on
no
no
aunt
victor
loves
me
he
almost
idolizes
me
and
i
adore
him
he
is
so
yes
you
love
him
but
you
avoid
him
do
you
not
yes
sometimes
he
seeks
me
too
and
often
when
you
are
alone
you
are
troubled
with
the
fear
that
he
may
suddenly
break
in
on
your
solitude
alas
yes
aunt
but
indeed
i
love
him
i
do
assure
do
you
not
in
your
own
thoughts
blame
yourself
because
you
find
it
impossible
to
share
his
pleasures
do
you
never
think
at
times
that
marriage
is
a
heavier
yoke
than
an
illicit
passion
could
be
oh
that
is
just
it
she
wept
it
is
all
a
riddle
to
me
and
can
you
guess
it
all
my
faculties
are
benumbed
i
have
no
ideas
i
can
scarcely
see
at
all
i
am
weighed
down
by
vague
dread
which
freezes
me
till
i
can
not
feel
and
keeps
me
in
continual
torpor
i
have
no
voice
with
which
to
pity
myself
no
words
to
express
my
trouble
i
suffer
and
i
am
ashamed
to
suffer
when
victor
is
happy
at
my
babyish
nonsense
and
rubbish
all
of
it
exclaimed
the
aunt
and
a
gay
smile
an
of
the
joys
of
her
own
youth
suddenly
lighted
up
her
withered
face
and
do
you
too
laugh
the
younger
woman
cried
despairingly
it
was
just
my
own
case
the
marquise
returned
promptly
and
now
victor
has
left
you
you
have
become
a
girl
again
recovering
a
tranquillity
without
pleasure
and
without
pain
have
you
not
julie
opened
wide
eyes
of
bewilderment
in
fact
my
angel
you
adore
victor
do
you
not
but
still
you
would
rather
be
a
sister
to
him
than
a
wife
and
in
short
your
marriage
is
emphatically
not
a
success
well
no
aunt
but
why
do
you
smile
oh
you
are
right
poor
child
there
is
nothing
very
amusing
in
all
this
your
future
would
be
big
with
more
than
one
mishap
if
i
had
not
taken
you
under
my
protection
if
my
old
experience
of
life
had
not
guessed
the
very
innocent
cause
of
your
troubles
my
nephew
did
not
deserve
his
good
fortune
the
blockhead
in
the
reign
of
our
louis
quinze
a
young
wife
in
your
position
would
very
soon
have
punished
her
husband
for
behaving
like
a
ruffian
the
selfish
creature
the
men
who
serve
under
this
imperial
tyrant
are
all
of
them
ignorant
boors
they
take
brutality
for
gallantry
they
know
no
more
of
women
than
they
know
of
love
and
imagine
that
because
they
go
out
to
face
death
on
the
morrow
they
may
dispense
with
all
consideration
and
attentions
for
us
the
time
was
when
a
man
could
love
and
die
too
at
the
proper
time
my
niece
i
will
form
you
i
will
put
an
end
to
this
unhappy
divergence
between
you
a
natural
thing
enough
but
it
would
end
in
mutual
hatred
and
desire
for
a
divorce
always
supposing
that
you
did
not
die
on
the
way
to
julie
s
amazement
equaled
her
surprise
as
she
listened
to
her
aunt
she
was
surprised
by
her
language
dimly
divining
rather
than
appreciating
the
wisdom
of
the
words
she
heard
and
very
much
dismayed
to
find
what
this
relative
out
of
great
experience
passed
judgment
upon
victor
as
her
father
had
done
though
in
somewhat
milder
terms
perhaps
some
quick
prevision
of
the
future
crossed
her
mind
doubtless
at
any
rate
she
felt
the
heavy
weight
of
the
burden
which
must
inevitably
overwhelm
her
for
she
burst
into
tears
and
sprang
to
the
old
lady
s
arms
be
my
mother
she
sobbed
the
aunt
shed
no
tears
the
revolution
had
left
old
ladies
of
the
monarchy
but
few
tears
to
shed
love
in
bygone
days
and
the
terror
at
a
later
time
had
familiarized
them
with
extremes
of
joy
and
anguish
in
such
a
sort
that
amid
the
perils
of
life
they
preserved
their
dignity
and
coolness
a
capacity
for
sincere
but
undemonstrative
affection
which
never
disturbed
their
and
a
dignity
of
demeanor
which
a
younger
generation
has
done
very
ill
to
discard
the
dowager
took
julie
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
with
a
tenderness
and
pity
more
often
found
in
women
s
ways
and
manner
than
in
their
hearts
then
she
coaxed
her
niece
with
kind
soothing
words
assured
her
of
a
happy
future
lulled
her
with
promises
of
love
and
put
her
to
bed
as
if
she
had
been
not
a
niece
but
a
daughter
a
daughter
whose
hopes
and
cares
she
had
made
her
own
perhaps
the
old
marquise
had
found
her
own
youth
and
inexperience
and
beauty
again
in
this
nephew
s
wife
and
the
countess
fell
asleep
happy
to
have
found
a
friend
nay
a
mother
to
whom
she
could
tell
everything
freely
next
morning
when
the
two
women
kissed
each
other
with
heartfelt
kindness
and
that
look
of
intelligence
which
marks
a
real
advance
in
friendship
a
closer
intimacy
between
two
souls
they
heard
the
sound
of
horsehoofs
and
turning
both
together
saw
the
young
englishman
ride
slowly
past
the
window
after
his
wont
apparently
he
had
made
a
certain
study
of
the
life
led
by
the
two
lonely
women
for
he
never
failed
to
ride
by
as
they
sat
at
breakfast
and
again
at
dinner
his
horse
slackened
pace
of
its
own
accord
and
for
the
space
of
time
required
to
pass
the
two
windows
in
the
room
its
rider
turned
a
melancholy
look
upon
the
countess
who
seldom
deigned
to
take
the
slightest
notion
of
him
not
so
the
marquise
minds
not
necessarily
little
find
it
difficult
to
resist
the
little
curiosity
which
fastens
upon
the
most
trifling
event
that
enlivens
provincial
life
and
the
englishman
s
mute
way
of
expressing
his
timid
earnest
love
tickled
mme
de
listomere
for
her
the
periodically
recurrent
glance
became
a
part
of
the
day
s
routine
hailed
daily
with
new
jests
as
the
two
women
sat
down
to
table
both
of
them
looked
out
at
the
same
moment
this
time
julie
s
eyes
met
arthur
s
with
such
a
precision
of
sympathy
that
the
color
rose
to
her
face
the
stranger
immediately
urged
his
horse
into
a
gallop
and
went
what
is
to
be
done
madame
asked
julie
people
see
this
englishman
go
past
the
house
and
they
will
take
it
for
granted
that
i
yes
interrupted
her
aunt
well
then
could
i
not
tell
him
to
discontinue
his
promenades
would
not
that
be
a
way
of
telling
him
that
he
was
dangerous
you
might
put
that
notion
into
his
head
and
besides
can
you
prevent
a
man
from
coming
and
going
as
he
pleases
our
meals
shall
be
served
in
another
room
and
when
this
young
gentleman
sees
us
no
longer
there
will
be
an
end
of
making
love
to
you
through
the
window
there
dear
child
that
is
how
a
woman
of
the
world
but
the
measure
of
julie
s
misfortune
was
to
be
filled
up
the
two
women
had
scarcely
risen
from
table
when
victor
s
man
arrived
in
hot
haste
from
bourges
with
a
letter
for
the
countess
from
her
husband
the
servant
had
ridden
by
unfrequented
ways
victor
sent
his
wife
news
of
the
downfall
of
the
empire
and
the
capitulation
of
paris
he
himself
had
gone
over
to
the
bourbons
and
all
france
was
welcoming
them
back
with
transports
of
enthusiasm
he
could
not
go
so
far
as
tours
but
he
begged
her
to
come
at
once
to
join
him
at
orleans
where
he
hoped
to
be
in
readiness
with
passports
for
her
his
servant
an
old
soldier
would
be
her
escort
so
far
as
orleans
he
victor
believed
that
the
road
was
still
open
you
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
madame
said
the
man
the
prussians
austrians
and
english
are
about
to
effect
a
junction
either
at
blois
or
at
a
few
hours
later
julie
s
preparations
were
made
and
she
started
out
upon
her
journey
in
an
old
traveling
carriage
lent
by
her
aunt
why
should
you
not
come
with
us
to
paris
she
asked
as
she
put
her
arms
about
the
marquise
now
that
the
bourbons
have
come
back
you
would
be
even
if
there
had
not
been
this
return
i
should
still
have
gone
to
paris
my
poor
child
for
my
advice
is
only
too
necessary
to
both
you
and
victor
so
i
shall
make
all
my
preparations
for
rejoining
you
julie
set
out
she
took
her
maid
with
her
and
the
old
soldier
galloped
beside
the
carriage
as
escort
at
nightfall
as
they
changed
horses
for
the
last
stage
before
blois
julie
grew
uneasy
all
the
way
from
amboise
she
had
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
behind
them
a
carriage
following
hers
had
kept
at
the
same
distance
she
stood
on
the
step
and
looked
out
to
see
who
her
traveling
companions
might
be
and
in
the
moonlight
saw
arthur
standing
three
paces
away
gazing
fixedly
at
the
chaise
which
contained
her
again
their
eyes
met
the
countess
hastily
flung
herself
back
in
her
seat
but
a
feeling
of
dread
set
her
pulses
throbbing
it
seemed
to
her
as
to
most
innocent
and
inexperienced
young
wives
that
she
was
herself
to
blame
for
this
love
which
she
had
all
unwittingly
inspired
with
this
thought
came
an
instinctive
terror
perhaps
a
sense
of
her
own
helplessness
before
aggressive
audacity
one
of
a
man
s
strongest
weapons
is
the
terrible
power
of
compelling
a
woman
to
think
of
him
when
her
naturally
lively
imagination
takes
alarm
or
offence
at
the
thought
that
she
is
followed
the
countess
bethought
herself
of
her
aunt
s
advice
and
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
not
stir
from
her
place
during
the
rest
of
the
journey
but
every
time
the
horses
were
changed
she
heard
the
englishman
pacing
round
the
two
carriages
and
again
upon
the
road
heard
the
importunate
sound
of
the
wheels
of
his
caleche
julie
soon
began
to
think
that
when
once
reunited
to
her
husband
victor
would
know
how
to
defend
her
against
this
singular
persecution
yet
suppose
that
in
spite
of
everything
this
young
man
does
not
love
me
this
was
the
thought
that
came
last
of
all
no
sooner
did
she
reach
orleans
than
the
prussians
stopped
the
chaise
it
was
wheeled
into
an
and
put
under
a
guard
of
soldiers
resistance
was
out
of
the
question
the
foreign
soldiers
made
the
three
travelers
understand
by
signs
that
they
were
obeying
orders
and
that
no
one
could
be
allowed
to
leave
the
carriage
for
about
two
hours
the
countess
sat
in
tears
a
prisoner
surrounded
by
the
guard
who
smoked
laughed
and
occasionally
stared
at
her
with
insolent
curiosity
at
last
however
she
saw
her
captors
fall
away
from
the
carriage
with
a
sort
of
respect
and
heard
at
the
same
time
the
sound
of
horses
entering
the
yard
another
moment
and
a
little
group
of
foreign
officers
with
an
austrian
general
at
their
head
gathered
about
the
door
of
the
traveling
carriage
madame
said
the
general
pray
accept
our
apologies
a
mistake
has
been
made
you
may
continue
your
journey
without
fear
and
here
is
a
passport
which
will
spare
you
all
further
annoyance
of
any
trembling
the
countess
took
the
paper
and
faltered
out
some
vague
words
of
thanks
she
saw
arthur
now
wearing
an
english
uniform
standing
beside
the
general
and
could
not
doubt
that
this
prompt
deliverance
was
due
to
him
the
young
englishman
himself
looked
half
glad
half
melancholy
his
face
was
turned
away
and
he
only
dared
to
steal
an
occasional
glance
at
julie
s
face
thanks
to
the
passport
mme
d
aiglemont
reached
paris
without
further
misadventure
and
there
she
found
her
husband
victor
d
aiglemont
released
from
his
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
emperor
had
met
with
a
most
flattering
reception
from
the
comte
d
artois
recently
appointed
of
the
kingdom
by
his
brother
louis
xviii
d
aiglemont
received
a
commission
in
the
life
guards
equivalent
to
the
rank
of
general
but
amid
the
rejoicings
over
the
return
of
the
bourbons
fate
dealt
poor
julie
a
terrible
blow
the
death
of
the
marquise
de
was
an
irreparable
loss
the
old
lady
died
of
joy
and
of
an
accession
of
gout
to
the
heart
when
the
duc
d
angouleme
came
back
to
tours
and
the
one
living
being
entitled
by
her
age
to
enlighten
victor
the
woman
who
by
discreet
counsels
might
have
brought
about
perfect
unanimity
of
husband
and
wife
was
dead
and
julie
felt
the
full
extent
of
her
loss
henceforward
she
must
stand
alone
between
herself
and
her
husband
but
she
was
young
and
timid
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
result
or
that
from
the
first
she
would
elect
to
bear
her
lot
in
silence
the
very
perfections
of
her
character
forbade
her
to
venture
to
swerve
from
her
duties
or
to
attempt
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
her
sufferings
for
to
put
an
end
to
them
would
have
been
to
venture
on
delicate
ground
and
julie
s
girlish
modesty
shrank
from
the
thought
a
word
as
to
d
aiglemont
s
destinies
under
the
restoration
how
many
men
are
there
whose
utter
incapacity
is
a
secret
kept
from
most
of
their
acquaintance
for
such
as
these
high
rank
high
office
illustrious
birth
a
certain
veneer
of
politeness
and
considerable
reserve
of
manner
or
the
of
great
fortunes
are
but
so
many
sentinels
to
turn
back
critics
who
would
penetrate
to
the
presence
of
the
real
man
such
men
are
like
kings
in
that
their
real
figure
character
and
life
can
never
be
known
nor
justly
appreciated
because
they
are
always
seen
from
too
near
or
too
far
factitious
merit
has
a
way
of
asking
questions
and
saying
little
and
understands
the
art
of
putting
others
forward
to
save
the
necessity
of
posing
before
them
then
with
a
happy
knack
of
its
own
it
draws
and
attaches
others
by
the
thread
of
the
ruling
passion
of
keeping
men
of
far
greater
abilities
to
play
like
puppets
and
despising
those
whom
it
has
brought
down
to
its
own
level
the
petty
fixed
idea
naturally
prevails
it
has
the
advantage
of
persistence
over
the
plasticity
of
great
thoughts
the
observer
who
should
seek
to
estimate
and
appraise
the
negative
values
of
these
empty
heads
needs
subtlety
rather
than
superior
wit
for
the
task
patience
is
a
more
necessary
part
of
his
judicial
outfit
than
great
mental
grasp
cunning
and
tact
rather
than
any
elevation
or
greatness
of
ideas
yet
skilfully
as
such
usurpers
can
cover
and
defend
their
weak
points
it
is
difficult
to
delude
wife
and
mother
and
children
and
the
of
the
family
fortunately
for
them
however
these
persons
almost
always
keep
a
secret
which
in
a
manner
touches
the
honor
of
all
and
not
unfrequently
go
so
far
as
to
help
to
foist
the
imposture
upon
the
public
and
if
thanks
to
such
domestic
conspiracy
many
a
noodle
passes
current
for
a
man
of
ability
on
the
other
hand
many
another
who
has
real
ability
is
taken
for
a
noodle
to
redress
the
balance
and
the
total
average
of
this
kind
of
false
coin
in
circulation
in
the
state
is
a
pretty
constant
quantity
bethink
yourself
now
of
the
part
to
be
played
by
a
clever
woman
quick
to
think
and
feel
mated
with
a
husband
of
this
kind
and
can
you
not
see
a
vision
of
lives
full
of
sorrow
and
nothing
upon
earth
can
repay
such
hearts
so
full
of
love
and
tender
tact
put
a
woman
in
this
wretched
situation
and
she
will
force
a
way
out
of
it
for
herself
by
a
crime
like
catherine
whom
men
nevertheless
style
the
but
these
women
are
not
all
seated
upon
thrones
they
are
for
the
most
part
doomed
to
domestic
unhappiness
none
the
less
terrible
because
obscure
those
who
seek
consolation
in
this
present
world
for
their
woes
often
effect
nothing
but
a
change
of
ills
if
they
remain
faithful
to
their
duties
or
they
commit
a
sin
if
they
break
the
laws
for
their
pleasure
all
these
reflections
are
applicable
to
julie
s
domestic
life
before
the
fall
of
napoleon
nobody
was
jealous
of
d
aiglemont
he
was
one
colonel
among
many
an
efficient
orderly
as
good
a
man
as
you
could
find
for
a
dangerous
mission
as
unfit
as
well
could
be
for
an
important
command
d
aiglemont
was
looked
upon
as
a
dashing
soldier
such
as
the
emperor
liked
the
kind
of
man
whom
his
mess
usually
calls
a
good
the
restoration
gave
him
back
his
title
of
marquis
and
did
not
find
him
ungrateful
he
followed
the
bourbons
into
exile
at
ghent
a
piece
of
logical
loyalty
which
falsified
the
horoscope
drawn
for
him
by
his
late
who
predicted
that
victor
would
remain
a
colonel
all
his
life
after
the
hundred
days
he
received
the
appointment
of
and
for
the
second
time
became
a
marquis
but
it
was
d
aiglemont
s
ambition
to
be
a
peer
of
france
he
adopted
therefore
the
maxims
and
the
politics
of
the
cloaked
himself
in
dissimulation
which
hid
nothing
there
being
nothing
to
hide
cultivated
gravity
of
countenance
and
the
art
of
asking
questions
and
saying
little
and
was
taken
for
a
man
of
profound
wisdom
nothing
drew
him
from
his
intrenchments
behind
the
forms
of
politeness
he
laid
in
a
provision
of
formulas
and
made
lavish
use
of
his
stock
of
the
coined
at
need
in
paris
to
give
fools
the
small
change
for
the
ore
of
great
ideas
and
events
among
men
of
the
world
he
was
reputed
a
man
of
taste
and
discernment
and
as
a
bigoted
upholder
of
aristocratic
opinions
he
was
held
up
for
a
noble
character
if
by
chance
he
slipped
now
and
again
into
his
old
or
levity
others
were
ready
to
discover
an
undercurrent
of
diplomatic
intention
beneath
his
inanity
and
silliness
oh
he
only
says
exactly
as
much
as
he
means
to
say
thought
these
excellent
people
so
d
aiglemont
s
defects
and
good
qualities
stood
him
alike
in
good
stead
he
did
nothing
to
forfeit
a
high
military
reputation
gained
by
his
dashing
courage
for
he
had
never
been
a
great
thoughts
surely
were
engraven
upon
that
manly
aristocratic
countenance
which
imposed
upon
every
one
but
his
own
wife
and
when
everybody
else
believed
in
the
marquis
d
aiglemont
s
imaginary
talents
the
marquis
persuaded
himself
before
he
had
done
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
at
court
where
thanks
to
his
purely
external
qualifications
he
was
in
favor
and
taken
at
his
own
valuation
at
home
however
d
aiglemont
was
modest
instinctively
he
felt
that
his
wife
young
though
she
was
was
his
superior
and
out
of
this
involuntary
respect
there
grew
an
occult
power
which
the
marquise
was
obliged
to
wield
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
to
shake
off
the
burden
she
became
her
husband
s
adviser
the
director
of
his
actions
and
his
fortunes
it
was
an
unnatural
position
she
felt
it
as
something
of
a
humiliation
a
source
of
pain
to
be
buried
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
from
the
first
her
delicately
feminine
instinct
told
her
that
it
is
a
far
better
thing
to
obey
a
man
of
talent
than
to
lead
a
fool
and
that
a
young
wife
compelled
to
act
and
think
like
a
man
is
neither
man
nor
woman
but
a
being
who
lays
aside
all
the
charms
of
her
womanhood
along
with
its
misfortunes
yet
acquires
none
of
the
privileges
which
our
laws
give
to
the
stronger
sex
beneath
the
surface
her
life
was
a
bitter
mockery
was
she
not
compelled
to
protect
her
protector
to
worship
a
hollow
idol
a
poor
creature
who
flung
her
the
love
of
a
selfish
husband
as
the
wages
of
her
continual
who
saw
nothing
in
her
but
the
woman
and
who
either
did
not
think
it
worth
while
or
wrong
quite
as
deep
did
not
think
at
all
of
troubling
himself
about
her
pleasures
of
inquiring
into
the
cause
of
her
low
spirits
and
dwindling
health
and
the
marquis
like
most
men
who
chafe
under
a
wife
s
superiority
saved
his
by
arguing
from
julie
s
physical
feebleness
a
corresponding
lack
of
mental
power
for
which
he
was
pleased
to
pity
her
and
he
would
cry
out
upon
fate
which
had
given
him
a
sickly
girl
for
a
wife
the
executioner
posed
in
fact
as
the
victim
all
the
burdens
of
this
dreary
lot
fell
upon
the
marquise
who
still
must
smile
upon
her
foolish
lord
and
deck
a
house
of
mourning
with
flowers
and
make
a
parade
of
happiness
in
a
countenance
wan
with
secret
torture
and
with
this
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
honor
of
both
with
the
magnificent
immolation
of
self
the
young
marquise
unconsciously
acquired
a
wifely
dignity
a
consciousness
of
virtue
which
became
her
safeguard
amid
many
dangers
perhaps
if
her
heart
were
sounded
to
the
very
depths
this
intimate
closely
hidden
wretchedness
following
upon
her
unthinking
girlish
first
love
had
roused
in
her
an
abhorrence
of
passion
possibly
she
had
no
conception
of
its
rapture
nor
of
the
forbidden
but
frenzied
bliss
for
which
some
women
will
renounce
all
the
laws
of
prudence
and
the
principles
of
conduct
upon
which
society
is
based
she
put
from
her
like
a
dream
the
thought
of
bliss
and
tender
harmony
of
love
promised
by
mme
de
s
mature
experience
and
waited
resignedly
for
the
end
of
her
troubles
with
a
hope
that
she
might
die
young
her
health
had
declined
daily
since
her
return
from
touraine
her
life
seemed
to
be
measured
to
her
in
suffering
yet
her
was
graceful
her
malady
seemed
little
more
than
languor
and
might
well
be
taken
by
careless
eyes
for
a
fine
lady
s
whim
of
invalidism
her
doctors
had
condemned
her
to
keep
to
the
sofa
and
there
among
her
flowers
lay
the
marquise
fading
as
they
faded
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
walk
nor
to
bear
the
open
air
and
only
went
out
in
a
closed
carriage
yet
with
all
the
marvels
of
modern
luxury
and
invention
about
her
she
looked
more
like
an
indolent
queen
than
an
invalid
a
few
of
her
friends
half
in
love
perhaps
with
her
sad
plight
and
her
fragile
look
sure
of
finding
her
at
home
and
speculating
no
doubt
upon
her
future
restoration
to
health
would
come
to
bring
her
the
news
of
the
day
and
kept
her
informed
of
the
thousand
and
one
small
events
which
fill
life
in
paris
with
variety
her
melancholy
deep
and
real
though
it
was
was
still
the
melancholy
of
a
woman
rich
in
many
ways
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
was
like
a
flower
with
a
dark
insect
gnawing
at
its
root
occasionally
she
went
into
society
not
to
please
herself
but
in
obedience
to
the
exigencies
of
the
position
which
her
husband
aspired
to
take
in
society
her
beautiful
voice
and
the
perfection
of
her
singing
could
always
gain
the
social
success
so
gratifying
to
a
young
woman
but
what
was
social
success
to
her
who
drew
nothing
from
it
for
her
heart
or
her
hopes
her
husband
did
not
care
for
music
and
moreover
she
seldom
felt
at
her
ease
in
salons
where
her
beauty
attracted
homage
not
wholly
disinterested
her
position
excited
a
sort
of
cruel
compassion
a
morbid
curiosity
she
was
suffering
from
an
inflammatory
complaint
not
infrequently
fatal
for
which
our
nosology
as
yet
has
found
no
name
a
complaint
spoken
of
among
women
in
confidential
whispers
in
spite
of
the
silence
in
which
her
life
was
spent
the
cause
of
her
was
no
secret
she
was
still
but
a
girl
in
spite
of
her
marriage
the
slightest
glance
threw
her
into
confusion
in
her
endeavor
not
to
blush
she
was
always
laughing
always
apparently
in
high
spirits
she
would
never
admit
that
she
was
not
perfectly
well
and
anticipated
questions
as
to
her
health
by
subterfuges
in
however
an
event
took
place
which
did
much
to
alleviate
julie
s
hitherto
deplorable
existence
a
daughter
was
born
to
her
and
she
determined
to
nurse
her
child
herself
for
two
years
motherhood
its
multiplicity
of
cares
and
anxious
joys
made
life
less
hard
for
her
she
and
her
husband
lived
necessarily
apart
her
physicians
predicted
improved
health
but
the
marquise
herself
put
no
faith
in
these
auguries
based
on
theory
perhaps
like
many
a
one
for
whom
life
has
lost
its
sweetness
she
looked
forward
to
death
as
a
happy
termination
of
the
drama
but
with
the
beginning
of
the
year
life
grew
harder
than
ever
even
while
she
congratulated
herself
upon
the
negative
happiness
which
she
had
contrived
to
win
she
caught
a
terrifying
glimpse
of
yawning
depths
below
it
she
had
passed
by
degrees
out
of
her
husband
s
life
her
fine
tact
and
her
prudence
told
her
that
misfortune
must
come
and
that
not
singly
of
this
cooling
of
an
affection
already
lukewarm
and
wholly
selfish
sure
though
she
was
of
her
ascendency
over
victor
and
certain
as
she
felt
of
his
unalterable
esteem
she
dreaded
the
influence
of
unbridled
passions
upon
a
head
so
empty
so
full
of
rash
julie
s
friends
often
found
her
absorbed
in
prolonged
musings
the
less
clairvoyant
among
them
would
jestingly
ask
her
what
she
was
thinking
about
as
if
a
young
wife
would
think
of
nothing
but
frivolity
as
if
there
were
not
almost
always
a
depth
of
seriousness
in
a
mother
s
thoughts
unhappiness
like
great
happiness
induces
dreaming
sometimes
as
julie
played
with
her
little
helene
she
would
gaze
darkly
at
her
giving
no
reply
to
the
childish
questions
in
which
a
mother
delights
questioning
the
present
and
the
future
as
to
the
destiny
of
this
little
one
then
some
sudden
recollection
would
bring
back
the
scene
of
the
review
at
the
tuileries
and
fill
her
eyes
with
tears
her
father
s
prophetic
warnings
rang
in
her
ears
and
conscience
reproached
her
that
she
had
not
recognized
its
wisdom
her
troubles
had
all
come
of
her
own
wayward
folly
and
often
she
knew
not
which
among
so
many
were
the
hardest
to
bear
the
sweet
treasures
of
her
soul
were
unheeded
and
not
only
so
she
could
never
succeed
in
making
her
husband
understand
her
even
in
the
commonest
everyday
things
just
as
the
power
to
love
developed
and
grew
strong
and
active
a
legitimate
channel
for
the
affections
of
her
nature
was
denied
her
and
wedded
love
was
extinguished
in
grave
physical
and
mental
sufferings
add
to
this
that
she
now
felt
for
her
husband
that
pity
closely
bordering
upon
contempt
which
withers
all
affection
at
last
even
if
she
had
not
learned
from
conversations
with
some
of
her
friends
from
examples
in
life
from
sundry
occurrences
in
the
great
world
that
love
can
bring
ineffable
bliss
her
own
wounds
would
have
taught
her
to
divine
the
pure
and
deep
happiness
which
binds
two
kindred
souls
each
to
each
in
the
picture
which
her
memory
traced
of
the
past
arthur
s
frank
face
stood
out
daily
nobler
and
purer
it
was
but
a
flash
for
upon
that
recollection
she
dared
not
dwell
the
young
englishman
s
shy
silent
love
for
her
was
the
one
event
since
her
marriage
which
had
left
a
lingering
sweetness
in
her
darkened
and
lonely
heart
it
may
be
that
all
the
blighted
hopes
all
the
frustrated
longings
which
gradually
clouded
julie
s
mind
gathered
by
a
not
unnatural
trick
of
imagination
about
this
man
whose
manners
sentiments
and
character
seemed
to
have
so
much
in
common
with
her
own
this
idea
still
presented
itself
to
her
mind
fitfully
and
vaguely
like
a
dream
yet
from
that
dream
which
always
ended
in
a
sigh
julie
awoke
to
greater
wretchedness
to
keener
consciousness
of
the
latent
anguish
brooding
beneath
her
imaginary
bliss
occasionally
her
took
wilder
and
more
daring
flights
she
determined
to
have
happiness
at
any
cost
but
still
more
often
she
lay
a
helpless
victim
of
an
indescribable
numbing
stupor
the
words
she
heard
had
no
meaning
to
her
or
the
thoughts
which
arose
in
her
mind
were
so
vague
and
indistinct
that
she
could
not
find
language
to
express
them
balked
of
the
wishes
of
her
heart
realities
jarred
harshly
upon
her
girlish
dreams
of
life
but
she
was
obliged
to
devour
her
tears
to
whom
could
she
make
complaint
of
whom
be
understood
she
possessed
moreover
that
highest
degree
of
woman
s
sensitive
pride
the
exquisite
delicacy
of
feeling
which
silences
useless
complainings
and
declines
to
use
an
advantage
to
gain
a
triumph
which
can
only
humiliate
both
victor
and
vanquished
julie
tried
to
endow
d
aiglemont
with
her
own
abilities
and
virtues
flattering
herself
that
thus
she
might
enjoy
the
happiness
lacking
in
her
lot
all
her
woman
s
ingenuity
and
tact
was
employed
in
making
the
best
of
the
situation
pure
waste
of
pains
unsuspected
by
him
whom
she
thus
strengthened
in
his
despotism
there
were
moments
when
misery
became
an
intoxication
expelling
all
ideas
all
but
fortunately
sincere
piety
always
brought
her
back
to
one
supreme
hope
she
found
a
refuge
in
the
belief
in
a
future
life
a
wonderful
thought
which
enabled
her
to
take
up
her
painful
task
afresh
no
elation
of
victory
followed
those
terrible
inward
battles
and
throes
of
anguish
no
one
knew
of
those
long
hours
of
sadness
her
haggard
glances
met
no
response
from
human
eyes
and
during
the
brief
moments
snatched
by
chance
for
weeping
her
bitter
tears
fell
unheeded
and
in
solitude
one
evening
in
january
the
marquise
became
aware
of
the
full
gravity
of
the
crisis
gradually
brought
on
by
force
of
circumstances
when
a
husband
and
wife
know
each
other
thoroughly
and
their
relation
has
long
been
a
matter
of
use
and
wont
when
the
wife
has
learned
to
interpret
every
slightest
sign
when
her
quick
insight
discerns
thoughts
and
facts
which
her
husband
keeps
from
her
a
chance
word
or
a
remark
so
carelessly
let
fall
in
the
first
instance
seems
upon
subsequent
reflection
like
the
swift
breaking
out
of
light
a
wife
not
seldom
suddenly
awakes
upon
the
brink
of
a
precipice
or
in
the
depths
of
the
abyss
and
thus
it
was
with
the
marquise
she
was
feeling
glad
to
have
been
left
to
herself
for
some
days
when
the
real
reason
of
her
solitude
flashed
upon
her
her
husband
whether
fickle
and
tired
of
her
or
generous
and
full
of
pity
for
her
was
hers
no
longer
in
the
moment
of
that
discovery
she
forgot
herself
her
sacrifices
all
that
she
had
passed
through
she
remembered
only
that
she
was
a
mother
looking
forward
she
thought
of
her
daughter
s
fortune
of
the
future
welfare
of
the
one
creature
through
whom
some
gleams
of
happiness
came
to
her
of
her
helene
the
only
possession
which
bound
her
to
life
then
julie
wished
to
live
to
save
her
child
from
a
stepmother
s
terrible
thraldom
which
might
crush
her
darling
s
life
upon
this
new
vision
of
threatened
possibilities
followed
one
of
those
paroxysms
of
thought
at
which
consume
whole
years
of
life
henceforward
husband
and
wife
were
doomed
to
be
separated
by
a
whole
world
of
thought
and
all
the
weight
of
that
world
she
must
bear
alone
hitherto
she
had
felt
sure
that
victor
loved
her
in
so
far
as
he
could
be
said
to
love
she
had
been
the
slave
of
pleasures
which
she
did
not
share
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
purchased
his
contentment
with
her
tears
was
hers
no
longer
she
was
alone
in
the
world
nothing
was
left
to
her
now
but
a
choice
of
evils
in
the
calm
stillness
of
the
night
her
despondency
drained
her
of
all
her
strength
she
rose
from
her
sofa
beside
the
dying
fire
and
stood
in
the
lamplight
gazing
at
her
child
when
d
aiglemont
came
in
he
was
in
high
spirits
julie
called
to
him
to
admire
helene
as
she
lay
asleep
but
he
met
his
wife
s
enthusiasm
with
a
commonplace
all
children
are
nice
at
that
he
closed
the
curtains
about
the
cot
after
a
careless
kiss
on
the
child
s
forehead
then
he
turned
his
eyes
on
julie
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
to
sit
beside
him
on
the
sofa
where
she
had
been
sitting
with
such
dark
thoughts
surging
up
in
her
mind
you
are
looking
very
handsome
mme
d
aiglemont
he
exclaimed
with
the
gaiety
intolerable
to
the
marquise
who
knew
its
emptiness
so
well
where
have
you
spent
the
evening
she
asked
with
a
pretence
of
complete
indifference
at
mme
de
serizy
he
had
taken
up
a
and
was
looking
intently
at
the
gauze
he
had
not
noticed
the
traces
of
tears
on
his
wife
s
face
julie
shuddered
words
could
not
express
the
overflowing
torrent
of
thoughts
which
must
be
forced
down
into
inner
depths
mme
de
serizy
is
giving
a
concert
on
monday
and
is
dying
for
you
to
go
you
have
not
been
anywhere
for
some
time
past
and
that
is
enough
to
set
her
longing
to
see
you
at
her
house
she
is
a
woman
and
very
fond
of
you
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
go
i
all
but
promised
that
you
should
i
will
there
was
something
so
penetrating
so
significant
in
the
tones
of
julie
s
voice
in
her
accent
in
the
glance
that
went
with
the
words
that
victor
startled
out
of
his
indifference
stared
at
his
wife
in
astonishment
that
was
all
julie
had
guessed
that
it
was
mme
de
serizy
who
had
stolen
her
husband
s
heart
from
her
her
brooding
despair
benumbed
her
she
appeared
to
be
deeply
interested
in
the
fire
victor
meanwhile
still
played
with
the
he
looked
bored
like
a
man
who
has
enjoyed
himself
elsewhere
and
brought
home
the
consequent
lassitude
he
yawned
once
or
twice
then
he
took
up
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
with
the
other
languidly
sought
his
wife
s
neck
for
the
usual
embrace
but
julie
stooped
and
received
the
kiss
upon
her
forehead
the
formal
loveless
grimace
seemed
hateful
to
her
at
that
moment
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
upon
victor
his
wife
sank
into
a
seat
her
limbs
tottered
beneath
her
she
burst
into
tears
none
but
those
who
have
endured
the
torture
of
some
such
scene
can
fully
understand
the
anguish
that
it
means
or
divine
the
horror
of
the
tragedy
arising
out
of
it
those
simple
foolish
words
the
silence
that
followed
between
the
husband
and
wife
the
marquis
gesture
and
expression
the
way
in
which
he
sat
before
the
fire
his
attitude
as
he
made
that
futile
attempt
to
put
a
kiss
on
his
wife
s
throat
all
these
things
made
up
a
dark
hour
for
julie
and
the
catastrophe
of
the
drama
of
her
sad
and
lonely
life
in
her
madness
she
knelt
down
before
the
sofa
burying
her
face
in
it
to
shut
out
everything
from
sight
and
prayed
to
heaven
putting
a
new
significance
into
the
words
of
the
evening
prayer
till
it
became
a
cry
from
the
depths
of
her
own
soul
which
would
have
gone
to
her
husband
s
heart
if
he
had
heard
it
the
following
week
she
spent
in
deep
thought
for
her
future
utterly
overwhelmed
by
this
new
trouble
she
made
a
study
of
it
trying
to
discover
a
way
to
regain
her
ascendency
over
the
marquis
scheming
how
to
live
long
enough
to
watch
over
her
daughter
s
happiness
yet
to
live
true
to
her
own
heart
then
she
made
up
her
mind
she
would
struggle
with
her
rival
she
would
shine
once
more
in
society
she
would
feign
the
love
which
she
could
no
longer
feel
she
would
captivate
her
husband
s
fancy
and
when
she
had
lured
him
into
her
power
she
would
coquet
with
him
like
a
capricious
mistress
who
takes
delight
in
tormenting
a
lover
this
hateful
strategy
was
the
only
possible
way
out
of
her
troubles
in
this
way
she
would
become
mistress
of
the
situation
she
would
prescribe
her
own
sufferings
at
her
good
pleasure
and
reduce
them
by
enslaving
her
husband
and
bringing
him
under
a
tyrannous
yoke
she
felt
not
the
slightest
remorse
for
the
hard
life
which
he
should
lead
at
a
bound
she
reached
cold
calculating
indifference
for
her
daughter
s
sake
she
had
gained
a
sudden
insight
into
the
treacherous
lying
arts
of
degraded
women
the
wiles
of
coquetry
the
revolting
cunning
which
arouses
such
profound
hatred
in
men
at
the
mere
suspicion
of
innate
corruption
in
a
woman
julie
s
feminine
vanity
her
interests
and
a
vague
desire
to
inflict
punishment
all
wrought
unconsciously
with
the
mother
s
love
within
her
to
force
her
into
a
path
where
new
sufferings
awaited
her
but
her
nature
was
too
noble
her
mind
too
fastidious
and
above
all
things
too
open
to
be
the
accomplice
of
these
frauds
for
very
long
accustomed
as
she
was
to
at
the
first
step
in
vice
for
vice
it
was
the
cry
of
conscience
must
inevitably
drown
the
clamor
of
the
passions
and
of
selfishness
indeed
in
a
young
wife
whose
heart
is
still
pure
whose
love
has
never
been
mated
the
very
sentiment
of
motherhood
is
overpowered
by
modesty
modesty
is
not
all
womanhood
summed
up
in
that
but
just
now
julie
would
not
see
any
danger
anything
wrong
in
her
life
she
went
to
mme
de
serizy
s
concert
her
rival
had
expected
to
see
a
pallid
drooping
woman
the
marquise
wore
rouge
and
appeared
in
all
the
splendor
of
a
toilet
which
enhanced
her
beauty
mme
de
serizy
was
one
of
those
women
who
claim
to
exercise
a
sort
of
sway
over
fashions
and
society
in
paris
she
issued
her
decrees
saw
them
received
in
her
own
circle
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
the
world
obeyed
them
she
aspired
to
epigram
she
set
up
for
an
authority
in
matters
of
taste
literature
politics
men
and
women
all
alike
were
submitted
to
her
censorship
and
the
lady
herself
appeared
to
defy
the
censorship
of
others
her
house
was
in
every
respect
a
model
of
good
taste
julie
triumphed
over
the
countess
in
her
own
salon
filled
as
it
was
with
beautiful
women
and
women
of
fashion
julie
s
liveliness
and
sparkling
wit
gathered
all
the
most
distinguished
men
in
the
rooms
about
her
her
costume
was
faultless
for
the
despair
of
the
women
who
one
and
all
envied
her
the
fashion
of
her
dress
and
attributed
the
moulded
outline
of
her
bodice
to
the
genius
of
some
unknown
dressmaker
for
women
would
rather
believe
in
miracles
worked
by
the
science
of
chiffons
than
in
the
grace
and
perfection
of
the
form
beneath
when
julie
went
to
the
piano
to
sing
desdemona
s
song
the
men
in
the
rooms
flocked
about
her
to
hear
the
celebrated
voice
so
long
mute
and
there
was
a
deep
silence
the
marquise
saw
the
heads
clustered
thickly
in
the
doorways
saw
all
eyes
turned
upon
her
and
a
sharp
thrill
of
excitement
quivered
through
her
she
looked
for
her
husband
gave
him
a
coquettish
and
it
pleased
her
to
see
that
his
vanity
was
gratified
to
no
small
degree
in
the
joy
of
triumph
she
sang
the
first
part
of
piu
her
audience
was
enraptured
never
had
malibran
nor
pasta
sung
with
expression
and
intonation
so
perfect
but
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
part
she
glanced
over
the
glistening
groups
and
saw
arthur
he
never
took
his
eyes
from
her
face
a
quick
shudder
thrilled
through
her
and
her
voice
faltered
up
hurried
mme
de
serizy
from
her
place
what
is
it
dear
oh
poor
little
thing
she
is
in
such
weak
health
i
was
so
afraid
when
i
saw
her
begin
a
piece
so
far
beyond
her
the
song
was
interrupted
julie
was
vexed
she
had
not
courage
to
sing
any
longer
and
submitted
to
her
rival
s
treacherous
sympathy
there
was
a
whisper
among
the
women
the
incident
led
to
discussions
they
guessed
that
the
struggle
had
begun
between
the
marquise
and
mme
de
serizy
and
their
tongues
did
not
spare
the
latter
julie
s
strange
perturbing
presentiments
were
suddenly
realized
through
her
preoccupation
with
arthur
she
had
loved
to
imagine
that
with
that
gentle
refined
face
he
must
remain
faithful
to
his
first
love
there
were
times
when
she
felt
proud
that
this
ideal
pure
and
passionate
young
love
should
have
been
hers
the
passion
of
the
young
lover
whose
thoughts
are
all
for
her
to
whom
he
dedicates
every
moment
of
his
life
who
blushes
as
a
woman
blushes
thinks
as
a
woman
might
think
forgetting
ambition
fame
and
fortune
in
devotion
to
his
love
she
need
never
fear
a
rival
all
these
things
she
had
fondly
and
idly
dreamed
of
arthur
now
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
dream
had
come
true
in
the
young
englishman
s
face
she
read
the
same
deep
thoughts
the
same
pensive
melancholy
the
same
passive
acquiescence
in
a
painful
lot
and
an
endurance
like
her
own
she
saw
herself
in
him
trouble
and
sadness
are
the
most
eloquent
of
love
s
interpreters
and
response
is
marvelously
swift
between
two
suffering
creatures
for
in
them
the
powers
of
intuition
and
of
assimilation
of
facts
and
ideas
are
unerring
and
perfect
so
with
the
violence
of
the
shock
the
marquise
s
eyes
were
opened
to
the
whole
extent
of
the
future
danger
she
was
only
too
glad
to
find
a
pretext
for
her
nervousness
in
her
chronic
and
willingly
submitted
to
be
overwhelmed
by
mme
de
serizy
s
insidious
compassion
that
incident
of
the
song
caused
talk
and
discussion
which
differed
with
the
various
groups
some
pitied
julie
s
fate
and
regretted
that
such
a
remarkable
woman
was
lost
to
society
others
fell
to
wondering
what
the
cause
of
her
and
seclusion
could
be
well
now
my
dear
ronquerolles
said
the
marquis
addressing
mme
de
serizy
s
brother
you
used
to
envy
me
my
good
fortune
and
you
used
to
blame
me
for
my
infidelities
pshaw
you
would
not
find
much
to
envy
in
my
lot
if
like
me
you
had
a
pretty
wife
so
fragile
that
for
the
past
two
years
you
might
not
so
much
as
kiss
her
hand
for
fear
of
damaging
her
do
not
you
encumber
yourself
with
one
of
those
fragile
ornaments
only
fit
to
put
in
a
glass
case
so
brittle
and
so
costly
that
you
are
always
obliged
to
be
careful
of
them
they
tell
me
that
you
are
afraid
of
snow
or
wet
for
that
fine
horse
of
yours
how
often
do
you
ride
him
that
is
just
my
own
case
it
is
true
that
my
wife
gives
me
no
ground
for
jealousy
but
my
marriage
is
purely
ornamental
business
if
you
think
that
i
am
a
married
man
you
are
grossly
mistaken
so
there
is
some
excuse
for
my
unfaithfulness
i
should
dearly
like
to
know
what
you
gentlemen
who
laugh
at
me
would
do
in
my
place
not
many
men
would
be
so
considerate
as
i
am
i
am
sure
here
he
lowered
his
voice
that
mme
d
aiglemont
suspects
nothing
and
then
of
course
i
have
no
right
to
complain
at
all
i
am
very
well
off
only
there
is
nothing
more
trying
for
a
man
who
feels
things
than
the
sight
of
suffering
in
a
poor
creature
to
whom
you
are
attached
you
must
have
a
very
sensitive
nature
then
said
de
ronquerolles
for
you
are
not
often
at
laughter
followed
on
the
friendly
epigram
but
arthur
who
made
one
of
the
group
maintained
a
frigid
imperturbability
in
his
quality
of
an
english
gentleman
who
takes
gravity
for
the
very
basis
of
his
being
d
aiglemont
s
eccentric
confidence
no
doubt
had
kindled
some
kind
of
hope
in
arthur
for
he
stood
patiently
awaiting
an
opportunity
of
a
word
with
the
marquis
he
had
not
to
wait
long
my
lord
marquis
he
said
i
am
unspeakably
pained
to
see
the
state
of
mme
d
aiglemont
s
health
i
do
not
think
that
you
would
talk
jestingly
about
it
if
you
knew
that
unless
she
adopts
a
certain
course
of
treatment
she
must
die
miserably
if
i
use
this
language
to
you
it
is
because
i
am
in
a
manner
justified
in
using
it
for
i
am
quite
certain
that
i
can
save
mme
d
aiglemont
s
life
and
restore
her
to
health
and
happiness
it
is
odd
no
doubt
that
a
man
of
my
rank
should
be
a
physician
yet
nevertheless
chance
determined
that
i
should
study
medicine
i
find
life
dull
enough
here
he
continued
affecting
a
cold
selfishness
to
gain
his
ends
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
whether
i
spend
my
time
and
travel
for
the
benefit
of
a
suffering
or
waste
it
in
paris
on
some
nonsense
or
other
it
is
very
very
seldom
that
a
cure
is
completed
in
these
complaints
for
they
require
constant
care
time
and
patience
and
above
all
things
money
travel
is
needed
and
a
punctilious
following
out
of
prescriptions
by
no
means
unpleasant
and
varied
daily
two
laying
a
stress
on
the
word
in
its
english
sense
can
understand
each
other
i
give
you
warning
that
if
you
accept
my
proposal
you
shall
be
a
judge
of
my
conduct
at
every
moment
i
will
do
nothing
without
consulting
you
without
your
superintendence
and
i
will
answer
for
the
success
of
my
method
if
you
will
consent
to
follow
it
yes
unless
you
wish
to
be
mme
d
aiglemont
s
husband
no
longer
and
that
before
long
he
added
in
the
marquis
ear
the
marquis
laughed
one
thing
is
certain
that
only
an
englishman
could
make
me
such
an
extraordinary
proposal
he
said
permit
me
to
leave
it
unaccepted
and
unrejected
i
will
think
it
over
and
my
wife
must
be
consulted
first
in
any
julie
had
returned
to
the
piano
this
time
she
sang
a
song
from
son
regina
son
and
the
whole
room
applauded
a
stifled
outburst
of
wellbred
acclamation
which
proved
that
the
faubourg
had
been
roused
to
enthusiasm
by
her
singing
the
evening
was
over
d
aiglemont
brought
his
wife
home
and
julie
saw
with
uneasy
satisfaction
that
her
first
attempt
had
at
once
been
successful
her
husband
had
been
roused
out
of
indifference
by
the
part
which
she
had
played
and
now
he
meant
to
honor
her
with
such
a
passing
fancy
as
he
might
bestow
upon
some
opera
nymph
it
amused
julie
that
she
a
virtuous
married
woman
should
be
treated
thus
she
tried
to
play
with
her
power
but
at
the
outset
her
kindness
broke
down
once
more
and
she
received
the
most
terrible
of
all
the
lessons
held
in
store
for
her
by
fate
between
two
and
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
julie
sat
up
sombre
and
moody
beside
her
sleeping
husband
in
the
room
dimly
lighted
by
the
flickering
lamp
deep
silence
prevailed
her
agony
of
remorse
had
lasted
near
an
hour
how
bitter
her
tears
had
been
none
perhaps
can
realize
save
women
who
have
known
such
an
experience
as
hers
only
such
natures
as
julie
s
can
feel
her
loathing
for
a
calculated
caress
the
horror
of
a
loveless
kiss
of
the
heart
s
apostasy
followed
by
dolorous
prostitution
she
despised
herself
she
cursed
marriage
she
could
have
longed
for
death
perhaps
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
cry
from
her
child
she
would
have
sprung
from
the
window
and
dashed
herself
upon
the
pavement
d
aiglemont
slept
on
peacefully
at
her
side
his
wife
s
hot
dropping
tears
did
not
waken
him
but
next
morning
julie
could
be
gay
she
made
a
great
effort
to
look
happy
to
hide
not
her
melancholy
as
heretofore
but
an
insuperable
loathing
from
that
day
she
no
longer
regarded
herself
as
a
blameless
wife
had
she
not
been
false
to
herself
why
should
she
not
play
a
double
part
in
the
future
and
display
astounding
depths
of
cunning
in
deceiving
her
husband
in
her
there
lay
a
hitherto
undiscovered
latent
depravity
lacking
only
opportunity
and
her
marriage
was
the
cause
even
now
she
had
asked
herself
why
she
should
struggle
with
love
when
with
her
heart
and
her
whole
nature
in
revolt
she
gave
herself
to
the
husband
whom
she
loved
no
longer
perhaps
who
knows
some
piece
of
fallacious
reasoning
some
bit
of
special
pleading
lies
at
the
root
of
all
sins
of
all
crimes
how
shall
society
exist
unless
every
individual
of
which
it
is
composed
will
make
the
necessary
sacrifices
of
inclination
demanded
by
its
laws
if
you
accept
the
benefits
of
civilized
society
do
you
not
by
implication
engage
to
observe
the
conditions
the
conditions
of
its
very
existence
and
yet
starving
wretches
compelled
to
respect
the
laws
of
property
are
not
less
to
be
pitied
than
women
whose
natural
instincts
and
sensitiveness
are
turned
to
so
many
avenues
of
pain
a
few
days
after
that
scene
of
which
the
secret
lay
buried
in
the
midnight
couch
d
aiglemont
introduced
lord
grenville
julie
gave
the
guest
a
stiffly
polite
reception
which
did
credit
to
her
powers
of
dissimulation
resolutely
she
silenced
her
heart
veiled
her
eyes
steadied
her
voice
and
she
kept
her
future
in
her
own
hands
then
when
by
these
devices
this
innate
as
it
may
be
called
she
had
discovered
the
full
extent
of
the
love
which
she
inspired
mme
d
aiglemont
welcomed
the
hope
of
a
speedy
cure
and
no
longer
opposed
her
husband
who
pressed
her
to
accept
the
young
doctor
s
offer
yet
she
declined
to
trust
herself
with
lord
grenville
until
after
some
further
study
of
his
words
and
manner
she
could
feel
certain
that
he
had
sufficient
generosity
to
endure
his
pain
in
silence
she
had
absolute
power
over
him
and
she
had
begun
to
abuse
that
power
already
was
she
not
a
woman
montcontour
is
an
old
build
upon
the
sandy
cliffs
above
the
loire
not
far
from
the
bridge
where
julie
s
journey
was
interrupted
in
it
is
a
picturesque
white
chateau
with
turrets
covered
with
fine
stone
carving
like
mechlin
lace
a
chateau
such
as
you
often
see
in
touraine
spick
and
span
ivy
clad
standing
among
its
groves
of
mulberry
trees
and
vineyards
with
its
hollow
walks
its
stone
balustrades
and
cellars
mined
in
the
rock
escarpments
mirrored
in
the
loire
the
roofs
of
montcontour
gleam
in
the
sun
the
whole
land
glows
in
the
burning
heat
traces
of
the
romantic
charm
of
spain
and
the
south
hover
about
the
enchanting
spot
the
breeze
brings
the
scent
of
bell
flowers
and
golden
broom
the
air
is
soft
all
about
you
lies
a
sunny
land
a
land
which
casts
its
dreamy
spell
over
your
soul
a
land
of
languor
and
of
soft
desire
a
fair
country
where
pain
is
lulled
to
sleep
and
passion
wakes
no
heart
is
cold
for
long
beneath
its
clear
sky
beside
its
sparkling
waters
one
ambition
dies
after
another
and
you
sink
into
serene
content
and
repose
as
the
sun
sinks
at
the
end
of
the
day
swathed
about
with
purple
and
azure
one
warm
august
evening
in
two
people
were
climbing
the
paths
cut
in
the
crags
above
the
chateau
doubtless
for
the
sake
of
the
view
from
the
heights
above
the
two
were
julie
and
lord
grenville
but
this
julie
seemed
to
be
a
new
creature
the
unmistakable
color
of
health
glowed
in
her
face
overflowing
vitality
had
brought
a
light
into
her
eyes
which
sparkled
through
a
moist
film
with
that
liquid
brightness
which
gives
such
irresistible
charm
to
the
eyes
of
children
she
was
radiant
with
smiles
she
felt
the
joy
of
living
and
all
the
possibilities
of
life
from
the
very
way
in
which
she
lifted
her
little
feet
it
was
easy
to
see
that
no
suffering
trammeled
her
lightest
movements
there
was
no
heaviness
nor
languor
in
her
eyes
her
voice
as
heretofore
under
the
white
silk
sunshade
which
screened
her
from
the
hot
sunlight
she
looked
like
some
young
bride
beneath
her
veil
or
a
maiden
waiting
to
yield
to
the
magical
enchantments
of
love
arthur
led
her
with
a
lover
s
care
helping
her
up
the
pathway
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
finding
the
smoothest
ways
avoiding
the
stones
for
her
bidding
her
see
glimpses
of
distance
or
some
flower
beside
the
path
always
with
the
unfailing
goodness
the
same
delicate
design
in
all
that
he
did
the
intuitive
sense
of
this
woman
s
wellbeing
seemed
to
be
innate
in
him
and
as
much
nay
perhaps
more
a
part
of
his
being
as
the
pulse
of
his
own
life
the
patient
and
her
doctor
went
step
for
step
there
was
nothing
strange
for
them
in
a
sympathy
which
seemed
to
have
existed
since
the
day
when
they
first
walked
together
one
will
swayed
them
both
they
stopped
as
their
senses
received
the
same
impression
every
word
and
every
glance
told
of
the
same
thought
in
either
mind
they
had
climbed
up
through
the
vineyards
and
now
they
turned
to
sit
on
one
of
the
long
white
stones
quarried
out
of
the
caves
in
the
hillside
but
julie
stood
awhile
gazing
out
over
the
landscape
what
a
beautiful
country
she
cried
let
us
put
up
a
tent
and
live
here
victor
victor
do
come
up
here
d
aiglemont
answered
by
a
halloo
from
below
he
did
not
however
hurry
himself
merely
giving
his
wife
a
glance
from
time
to
time
when
the
windings
of
the
path
gave
him
a
glimpse
of
her
julie
breathed
the
air
with
delight
she
looked
up
at
arthur
giving
him
one
of
those
subtle
glances
in
which
a
clever
woman
can
put
the
whole
of
her
thought
ah
i
should
like
to
live
here
always
she
said
would
it
be
possible
to
tire
of
this
beautiful
valley
what
is
the
picturesque
river
called
do
you
know
that
is
the
the
cise
she
repeated
and
all
this
country
below
before
us
those
are
the
low
hills
above
the
and
away
to
the
right
ah
that
is
tours
only
see
how
fine
the
cathedral
towers
look
in
the
she
was
silent
and
let
fall
the
hand
which
she
had
stretched
out
towards
the
view
upon
arthur
s
both
admired
the
wide
landscape
made
up
of
so
much
blended
beauty
neither
of
them
spoke
the
murmuring
voice
of
the
river
the
pure
air
and
the
cloudless
heaven
were
all
in
tune
with
their
thronging
thoughts
and
their
youth
and
the
love
in
their
hearts
oh
how
i
love
this
country
julie
continued
with
growing
and
ingenuous
enthusiasm
you
lived
here
for
a
long
while
did
you
not
she
added
after
a
pause
a
thrill
ran
through
lord
grenville
at
her
words
it
was
down
there
he
said
in
a
melancholy
voice
indicating
as
he
spoke
a
cluster
of
walnut
trees
by
the
roadside
that
i
a
prisoner
saw
you
for
the
first
yes
but
even
at
that
time
i
felt
very
sad
this
country
looked
wild
to
me
then
but
now
she
broke
off
and
lord
grenville
did
not
dare
to
look
at
her
all
this
pleasure
i
owe
to
you
julie
began
at
last
after
a
long
silence
only
the
living
can
feel
the
joy
of
life
and
until
now
have
i
not
been
dead
to
it
all
you
have
given
me
more
than
health
you
have
made
me
feel
all
its
worth
women
have
an
inimitable
talent
for
giving
utterance
to
strong
feelings
in
colorless
words
a
woman
s
eloquence
lies
in
tone
and
gesture
manner
and
glance
lord
grenville
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
for
his
tears
filled
his
eyes
this
was
julie
s
first
word
of
thanks
since
they
left
paris
a
year
ago
for
a
whole
year
he
had
watched
over
the
marquise
putting
his
whole
self
into
the
task
d
aiglemont
seconding
him
he
had
taken
her
first
to
aix
then
to
la
rochelle
to
be
near
the
sea
from
moment
to
moment
he
had
watched
the
changes
worked
in
julie
s
shattered
constitution
by
his
wise
and
simple
prescriptions
he
had
cultivated
her
health
as
an
enthusiastic
gardener
might
cultivate
a
rare
flower
yet
to
all
appearance
the
marquise
had
quietly
accepted
arthur
s
skill
and
care
with
the
egoism
of
a
spoiled
parisienne
or
like
a
courtesan
who
has
no
idea
of
the
cost
of
things
nor
of
the
worth
of
a
man
and
judges
of
both
by
their
comparative
usefulness
to
her
the
influence
of
places
upon
us
is
a
fact
worth
remarking
if
melancholy
comes
over
us
by
the
margin
of
a
great
water
another
indelible
law
of
our
nature
so
orders
it
that
the
mountains
exercise
a
purifying
influence
upon
our
feelings
and
among
the
hills
passion
gains
in
depth
by
all
that
it
apparently
loses
in
vivacity
perhaps
it
was
the
light
of
the
wide
country
by
the
loire
the
height
of
the
fair
sloping
hillside
on
which
the
lovers
sat
that
induced
the
calm
bliss
of
the
moment
when
the
whole
extent
of
the
passion
that
lies
beneath
a
few
words
is
divined
for
the
first
time
with
a
delicious
sense
of
happiness
julie
had
scarcely
spoken
the
words
which
had
moved
lord
grenville
so
deeply
when
a
caressing
breeze
ruffled
the
treetops
and
filled
the
air
with
coolness
from
the
river
a
few
clouds
crossed
the
sky
and
the
soft
brought
out
all
the
beauty
of
the
fair
land
below
julie
turned
away
her
head
lest
arthur
should
see
the
tears
which
she
succeeded
in
repressing
his
emotion
had
spread
at
once
to
her
she
dried
her
eyes
but
she
dared
not
raise
them
lest
he
should
read
the
excess
of
joy
in
a
glance
her
woman
s
instinct
told
her
that
during
this
hour
of
danger
she
must
hide
her
love
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
yet
silence
might
prove
equally
dangerous
and
julie
saw
that
lord
grenville
was
unable
to
utter
a
word
she
went
on
therefore
in
a
gentle
voice
you
are
touched
by
what
i
have
said
perhaps
such
a
quick
outburst
of
feeling
is
the
way
in
which
a
gracious
and
kind
nature
like
yours
reverses
a
mistaken
judgment
you
must
have
thought
me
ungrateful
when
i
was
cold
and
reserved
or
cynical
and
hard
all
through
the
journey
which
fortunately
is
very
near
its
end
i
should
not
have
been
worthy
of
your
care
if
i
had
been
unable
to
appreciate
it
i
have
forgotten
nothing
alas
i
shall
forget
nothing
not
the
anxious
way
in
which
you
watched
over
me
as
a
mother
watches
over
her
child
nor
and
above
all
else
the
noble
confidence
of
our
life
as
brother
and
sister
the
delicacy
of
your
conduct
winning
charms
against
which
we
women
are
defenceless
my
lord
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
make
you
a
return
at
these
words
julie
hastily
moved
further
away
and
lord
grenville
made
no
attempt
to
detain
her
she
went
to
a
rock
not
far
away
and
there
sat
motionless
what
either
felt
remained
a
secret
known
to
each
alone
doubtless
they
wept
in
silence
the
singing
of
the
birds
about
them
so
blithe
so
overflowing
with
tenderness
at
sunset
time
could
only
increase
the
storm
of
passion
which
had
driven
them
apart
nature
took
up
their
story
for
them
and
found
a
language
for
the
love
of
which
they
did
not
dare
to
speak
and
now
my
lord
said
julie
and
she
came
and
stood
before
arthur
with
a
great
dignity
which
allowed
her
to
take
his
hand
in
hers
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
hallow
and
purify
the
life
which
you
have
given
back
to
me
here
we
will
part
i
know
she
added
as
she
saw
how
white
his
face
grew
i
know
that
i
am
repaying
you
for
your
devotion
by
requiring
of
you
a
sacrifice
even
greater
than
any
which
you
have
hitherto
made
for
me
sacrifices
so
great
that
they
should
receive
some
better
recompense
than
this
but
it
must
be
you
must
not
stay
in
france
by
laying
this
command
upon
you
do
i
not
give
you
rights
which
shall
be
held
sacred
she
added
holding
his
hand
against
her
beating
heart
yes
said
arthur
and
he
rose
he
looked
in
the
direction
of
d
aiglemont
who
appeared
on
the
opposite
side
of
one
of
the
hollow
walks
with
the
child
in
his
arms
he
had
scrambled
up
on
the
balustrade
by
the
chateau
that
little
helene
might
jump
down
julie
i
will
not
say
a
word
of
my
love
we
understand
each
other
too
well
deeply
and
carefully
though
i
have
hidden
the
pleasures
of
my
heart
you
have
shared
them
all
i
feel
it
i
know
it
i
see
it
and
now
at
this
moment
as
i
receive
this
delicious
proof
of
the
constant
sympathy
of
our
hearts
i
must
go
cunning
schemes
for
getting
rid
of
him
have
crossed
my
mind
too
often
the
temptation
might
be
irresistible
if
i
stayed
with
i
had
the
same
thought
she
said
a
look
of
pained
surprise
in
her
troubled
face
yet
in
her
tone
and
involuntary
shudder
there
was
such
virtue
such
certainty
of
herself
won
in
many
a
battle
with
a
love
that
spoke
in
julie
s
tones
and
involuntary
gestures
that
lord
grenville
stood
thrilled
with
admiration
of
her
the
mere
shadow
of
a
crime
had
been
dispelled
from
that
clear
conscience
the
religious
sentiment
enthroned
on
the
fair
forehead
could
not
but
drive
away
the
evil
thoughts
that
arise
unbidden
engendered
by
our
imperfect
nature
thoughts
which
make
us
aware
of
the
grandeur
and
the
perils
of
human
destiny
and
then
she
said
i
should
have
drawn
down
your
scorn
upon
me
and
i
should
have
been
saved
she
added
and
her
eyes
fell
to
be
lowered
in
your
eyes
what
is
that
but
death
for
a
moment
the
two
heroic
lovers
were
silent
choking
down
their
sorrow
good
or
ill
it
seemed
that
their
thoughts
were
loyally
one
and
the
joys
in
the
depths
of
their
heart
were
no
more
experiences
apart
than
the
pain
which
they
strove
most
anxiously
to
hide
i
have
no
right
to
complain
she
said
after
a
while
my
misery
is
of
my
own
making
and
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
sky
perhaps
you
don
t
remember
it
but
that
is
the
place
where
we
met
each
other
for
the
first
time
shouted
the
general
from
below
and
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
distance
there
down
yonder
near
those
poplars
the
englishman
nodded
abruptly
by
way
of
answer
so
i
was
bound
to
die
young
and
to
know
no
happiness
julie
continued
yes
do
not
think
that
i
live
sorrow
is
just
as
fatal
as
the
dreadful
disease
which
you
have
cured
i
do
not
think
that
i
am
to
blame
no
my
love
is
stronger
than
i
am
and
eternal
but
all
unconsciously
it
grew
in
me
and
i
will
not
be
guilty
through
my
love
nevertheless
though
i
shall
be
faithful
to
my
conscience
as
a
wife
to
my
duties
as
a
mother
i
will
be
no
less
faithful
to
the
instincts
of
my
heart
hear
me
she
cried
in
an
unsteady
voice
henceforth
i
belong
to
no
by
a
gesture
dreadful
to
see
in
its
undisguised
loathing
she
indicated
her
husband
the
social
code
demands
that
i
shall
make
his
existence
happy
she
continued
i
will
obey
i
will
be
his
servant
my
devotion
to
him
shall
be
boundless
but
from
i
am
a
widow
i
will
neither
be
a
prostitute
in
my
own
eyes
nor
in
those
of
the
world
if
i
do
not
belong
to
d
aiglemont
i
will
never
belong
to
another
you
shall
have
nothing
nothing
save
this
which
you
have
wrung
from
me
this
is
the
doom
which
i
have
passed
upon
myself
she
said
looking
proudly
at
him
and
now
know
this
if
you
give
way
to
a
single
criminal
thought
d
aiglemont
s
widow
will
enter
a
convent
in
spain
or
italy
by
an
evil
chance
we
have
spoken
of
our
love
perhaps
that
confession
was
bound
to
come
but
our
hearts
must
never
vibrate
again
like
this
you
will
receive
a
letter
from
england
and
we
shall
part
and
never
see
each
other
the
effort
had
exhausted
all
julie
s
strength
she
felt
her
knees
trembling
and
a
feeling
of
deathly
cold
came
over
her
obeying
a
woman
s
instinct
she
sat
down
lest
she
should
sink
into
arthur
s
arms
cried
lord
grenville
the
sharp
cry
rang
through
the
air
like
a
crack
of
thunder
till
then
he
could
not
speak
now
all
the
words
which
the
dumb
lover
could
not
utter
gathered
themselves
in
that
heartrending
appeal
well
what
is
wrong
with
her
asked
the
general
who
had
hurried
up
at
that
cry
and
now
suddenly
confronted
the
two
nothing
serious
said
julie
with
that
wonderful
which
a
woman
s
usually
brings
to
her
aid
when
it
is
most
called
for
the
chill
damp
air
under
the
walnut
tree
made
me
feel
quite
faint
just
now
and
that
must
have
alarmed
this
doctor
of
mine
does
he
not
look
on
me
as
a
very
nearly
finished
work
of
art
he
was
startled
i
suppose
by
the
idea
of
seeing
it
with
ostentatious
coolness
she
took
lord
grenville
s
arm
smiled
at
her
husband
took
a
last
look
at
the
landscape
and
went
down
the
pathway
drawing
her
traveling
companion
with
her
this
certainly
is
the
grandest
view
that
we
have
seen
she
said
i
shall
never
forget
it
just
look
victor
what
distance
what
an
expanse
of
country
and
what
variety
in
it
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
this
her
laughter
was
almost
hysterical
but
to
her
husband
it
sounded
natural
she
sprang
gaily
down
into
the
hollow
pathway
and
vanished
what
she
cried
when
they
had
left
d
aiglemont
far
behind
so
soon
is
it
so
soon
another
moment
and
we
can
neither
of
us
be
ourselves
we
shall
never
be
ourselves
again
our
life
is
over
in
short
let
us
go
slowly
said
lord
grenville
the
carriages
are
still
some
way
off
and
if
we
may
put
words
into
our
glances
our
hearts
may
live
a
little
they
went
along
the
footpath
by
the
river
in
the
late
evening
light
almost
in
silence
such
vague
words
as
they
uttered
low
as
the
murmur
of
the
loire
stirred
their
souls
to
the
depths
just
as
the
sun
sank
a
last
red
gleam
from
the
sky
fell
over
them
it
was
like
a
mournful
symbol
of
their
love
the
general
much
put
out
because
the
carriage
was
not
at
the
spot
where
they
had
left
it
followed
and
outstripped
the
pair
without
interrupting
their
converse
lord
grenville
s
high
minded
and
delicate
behavior
throughout
the
journey
had
completely
dispelled
the
marquis
suspicions
for
some
time
past
he
had
left
his
wife
in
freedom
reposing
confidence
in
the
noble
amateur
s
punic
faith
arthur
and
julie
walked
on
together
in
the
close
and
painful
communion
of
two
hearts
laid
waste
so
short
a
while
ago
as
they
climbed
the
cliffs
at
montcontour
there
had
been
a
vague
hope
in
either
mind
an
uneasy
joy
for
which
they
dared
not
account
to
themselves
but
now
as
they
came
along
the
pathway
by
the
river
they
pulled
down
the
frail
structure
of
imaginings
the
child
s
cardcastle
on
which
neither
of
them
had
dared
to
breathe
that
hope
was
over
that
very
evening
lord
grenville
left
them
his
last
look
at
julie
made
it
miserably
plain
that
since
the
moment
when
sympathy
revealed
the
full
extent
of
a
tyrannous
passion
he
did
well
to
mistrust
himself
the
next
morning
d
aiglemont
and
his
wife
took
their
places
in
the
carriage
without
their
traveling
companion
and
were
whirled
swiftly
along
the
road
to
blois
the
marquise
was
constantly
put
in
mind
of
the
journey
made
in
when
as
yet
she
know
nothing
of
love
and
had
been
almost
ready
to
curse
it
for
its
persistency
countless
forgotten
impressions
were
revived
the
heart
has
its
own
memory
a
woman
who
can
not
recollect
the
most
important
great
events
will
recollect
through
a
lifetime
things
which
appealed
to
her
feelings
and
julie
d
aiglemont
found
all
the
most
trifling
details
of
that
journey
laid
up
in
her
mind
it
was
pleasant
to
her
to
recall
its
little
incidents
as
they
occurred
to
her
one
by
one
there
were
points
in
the
road
when
she
could
even
remember
the
thoughts
that
passed
through
her
mind
when
she
saw
them
first
victor
had
fallen
violently
in
love
with
his
wife
since
she
had
recovered
the
freshness
of
her
youth
and
all
her
beauty
and
now
he
pressed
close
to
her
side
like
a
lover
once
he
tried
to
put
his
arm
round
her
but
she
gently
disengaged
herself
finding
some
excuse
or
other
for
evading
the
harmless
caress
in
a
little
while
she
shrank
from
the
close
contact
with
victor
the
sensation
of
warmth
communicated
by
their
position
she
tried
to
take
the
unoccupied
place
opposite
but
victor
gallantly
resigned
the
back
seat
to
her
for
this
attention
she
thanked
him
with
a
sigh
whereupon
he
forgot
himself
and
the
don
juan
of
the
garrison
construed
his
wife
s
melancholy
to
his
own
advantage
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
she
was
compelled
to
speak
with
a
firmness
which
impressed
him
you
have
all
but
killed
me
dear
once
already
as
you
know
said
she
if
i
were
still
an
inexperienced
girl
i
might
begin
to
sacrifice
myself
afresh
but
i
am
a
mother
i
have
a
daughter
to
bring
up
and
i
owe
as
much
to
her
as
to
you
let
us
resign
ourselves
to
a
misfortune
which
affects
us
both
alike
you
are
the
less
to
be
pitied
have
you
not
as
it
is
found
consolations
which
duty
and
the
honor
of
both
and
stronger
still
which
nature
forbids
to
me
stay
she
added
you
carelessly
left
three
letters
from
mme
de
serizy
in
a
drawer
here
they
are
my
silence
about
this
matter
should
make
it
plain
to
you
that
in
me
you
have
a
wife
who
has
plenty
of
indulgence
and
does
not
exact
from
you
the
sacrifices
prescribed
by
the
law
but
i
have
thought
enough
to
see
that
the
roles
of
husband
and
wife
are
quite
different
and
that
the
wife
alone
is
predestined
to
misfortune
my
virtue
is
based
upon
firmly
fixed
and
definite
principles
i
shall
live
blamelessly
but
let
me
the
marquis
was
taken
aback
by
a
logic
which
women
grasp
with
the
clear
insight
of
love
and
overawed
by
a
certain
dignity
natural
to
them
at
such
crises
julie
s
instinctive
repugnance
for
all
that
jarred
upon
her
love
and
the
instincts
of
her
heart
is
one
of
the
fairest
qualities
of
woman
and
springs
perhaps
from
a
natural
virtue
which
neither
laws
nor
civilization
can
silence
and
who
shall
dare
to
blame
women
if
a
woman
can
silence
the
exclusive
sentiment
which
bids
her
forsake
all
other
for
the
man
whom
she
loves
what
is
she
but
a
priest
who
has
lost
his
faith
if
a
rigid
mind
here
and
there
condemns
julie
for
a
sort
of
compromise
between
love
and
wifely
duty
impassioned
souls
will
lay
it
to
her
charge
as
a
crime
to
be
thus
blamed
by
both
sides
shows
one
of
two
things
very
clearly
that
misery
necessarily
follows
in
the
train
of
broken
laws
or
else
that
there
are
deplorable
flaws
in
the
institutions
upon
which
society
in
europe
is
based
two
years
went
by
and
mme
d
aiglemont
went
their
separate
ways
leading
their
life
in
the
world
meeting
each
other
more
frequently
abroad
than
at
home
a
refinement
upon
divorce
in
which
many
a
marriage
in
the
great
world
is
apt
to
end
one
evening
strange
to
say
found
husband
and
wife
in
their
own
mme
d
aiglemont
had
been
dining
at
home
with
a
friend
and
the
general
who
almost
invariably
dined
in
town
had
not
gone
out
for
once
there
is
a
pleasant
time
in
store
for
you
la
said
d
aiglemont
setting
his
coffee
cup
down
upon
the
table
he
looked
at
the
guest
mme
de
wimphen
and
added
i
am
starting
off
for
several
days
sport
with
the
master
of
the
hounds
for
a
whole
week
at
any
rate
you
will
be
a
widow
in
good
earnest
just
what
you
wish
for
i
guillaume
he
said
to
the
servant
who
entered
tell
them
to
put
the
horses
mme
de
wimphen
was
the
friend
to
whom
julie
had
begun
the
letter
upon
her
marriage
the
glances
exchanged
by
the
two
women
said
plainly
that
in
her
julie
had
found
an
intimate
friend
an
indulgent
and
invaluable
confidante
mme
de
wimphen
s
marriage
had
been
a
very
happy
one
perhaps
it
was
her
own
happiness
which
secured
her
devotion
to
julie
s
unhappy
life
for
under
such
circumstances
dissimilarity
of
destiny
is
nearly
always
a
strong
bond
of
union
is
the
hunting
season
not
over
yet
asked
julie
with
an
indifferent
glance
at
her
husband
the
master
of
the
hounds
comes
when
and
where
he
pleases
madame
we
are
going
in
the
royal
take
care
that
no
accident
happens
to
accidents
are
usually
unforeseen
he
said
smiling
the
carriage
is
ready
my
lord
marquis
said
the
servant
madame
if
i
should
fall
a
victim
to
the
boar
he
continued
with
a
suppliant
air
what
does
this
mean
inquired
mme
de
wimphen
come
come
said
mme
d
aiglemont
turning
to
her
husband
smiling
at
her
friend
as
if
to
say
you
will
soon
julie
held
up
her
head
but
as
her
husband
came
close
to
her
she
swerved
at
the
last
so
that
his
kiss
fell
not
on
her
throat
but
on
the
broad
frill
about
it
you
will
be
my
witness
before
heaven
now
that
i
need
a
firman
to
obtain
this
little
grace
of
her
said
the
marquis
addressing
mme
de
wimphen
this
is
how
this
wife
of
mine
understands
love
she
has
brought
me
to
this
pass
by
what
trickery
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
a
pleasant
time
to
you
and
he
went
but
your
poor
husband
is
really
very
cried
louisa
de
wimphen
when
the
two
women
were
alone
together
he
loves
oh
not
another
syllable
after
that
last
word
the
name
i
bear
makes
me
shudder
yes
but
victor
obeys
you
implicitly
said
louisa
his
obedience
is
founded
in
part
upon
the
great
esteem
which
i
have
inspired
in
him
as
far
as
outward
things
go
i
am
a
model
wife
i
make
his
house
pleasant
to
him
i
shut
my
eyes
to
his
intrigues
i
touch
not
a
penny
of
his
fortune
he
is
free
to
squander
the
interest
exactly
as
he
pleases
i
only
stipulate
that
he
shall
not
touch
the
principal
at
this
price
i
have
peace
he
neither
explains
nor
attempts
to
explain
my
life
but
though
my
husband
is
guided
by
me
that
does
not
say
that
i
have
nothing
to
fear
from
his
character
i
am
a
bear
leader
who
daily
trembles
lest
the
muzzle
should
give
way
at
last
if
victor
once
took
it
into
his
head
that
i
had
forfeited
my
right
to
his
esteem
what
would
happen
next
i
dare
not
think
for
he
is
violent
full
of
personal
pride
and
vain
above
all
things
while
his
wits
are
not
keen
enough
to
enable
him
to
behave
discreetly
at
a
delicate
crisis
when
his
lowest
passions
are
involved
his
character
is
weak
and
he
would
very
likely
kill
me
provisionally
even
if
he
died
of
remorse
next
day
but
there
is
no
fear
of
that
fatal
good
a
brief
pause
followed
both
women
were
thinking
of
the
real
cause
of
this
state
of
affairs
julie
gave
louisa
a
glance
which
revealed
her
thoughts
i
have
been
cruelly
obeyed
she
cried
yet
i
never
forbade
him
to
write
to
me
oh
has
forgotten
me
and
he
is
right
if
his
life
had
been
spoiled
it
would
have
been
too
tragical
one
life
is
enough
is
it
not
would
you
believe
it
dear
i
read
english
newspapers
simply
to
see
his
name
in
print
but
he
has
not
yet
taken
his
seat
in
the
house
of
so
you
know
did
i
not
tell
you
yes
i
poor
little
one
cried
louisa
grasping
julie
s
hand
in
hers
how
can
you
still
live
that
is
the
secret
said
the
marquise
with
an
involuntary
gesture
almost
childlike
in
its
simplicity
listen
i
take
laudanum
that
duchess
in
london
suggested
the
idea
you
know
the
story
maturin
made
use
of
it
in
one
of
his
novels
my
drops
are
very
weak
but
i
sleep
i
am
only
awake
for
seven
hours
in
the
day
and
those
hours
i
spend
with
my
louisa
gazed
into
the
fire
the
full
extent
of
her
friend
s
misery
was
opening
out
before
her
for
the
first
time
and
she
dared
not
look
into
her
face
keep
my
secret
louisa
said
julie
after
a
moment
s
silence
just
as
she
spoke
the
footman
brought
in
a
letter
for
the
marquise
ah
she
cried
and
her
face
grew
white
i
need
not
ask
from
whom
it
comes
said
mme
de
wimphen
but
the
marquise
was
reading
the
letter
and
heeded
nothing
else
mme
de
wimphen
watching
her
friend
saw
strong
feeling
wrought
to
the
highest
pitch
ecstasy
of
the
most
dangerous
kind
painted
on
julie
s
face
in
swift
changing
white
and
red
at
length
julie
flung
the
sheet
into
the
fire
it
burns
like
fire
she
said
oh
my
heart
beats
till
i
can
not
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
walked
up
and
down
her
eyes
were
blazing
he
did
not
leave
paris
she
cried
mme
de
wimphen
did
not
dare
to
interrupt
the
words
that
followed
sentences
measured
by
dreadful
pauses
in
between
after
every
break
the
deep
notes
of
her
voice
sank
lower
and
lower
there
was
something
awful
about
the
last
words
he
has
seen
me
constantly
and
i
have
not
known
a
look
taken
by
stealth
every
day
helps
him
to
louisa
you
do
not
know
he
is
he
wants
to
say
to
me
he
knows
that
my
husband
has
gone
away
for
several
days
he
will
be
here
in
a
moment
oh
i
shall
die
i
am
listen
louisa
stay
with
me
am
afraid
but
my
husband
knows
that
i
have
been
dining
with
you
he
is
sure
to
come
for
me
said
mme
de
wimphen
well
then
before
you
go
i
will
send
away
i
will
play
the
executioner
for
us
both
oh
me
he
will
think
that
i
do
not
love
him
any
more
and
that
letter
of
his
dear
i
can
see
those
words
in
letters
of
a
carriage
rolled
in
under
the
archway
ah
cried
the
marquise
with
something
like
joy
in
her
voice
he
is
coming
openly
he
makes
no
mystery
of
lord
grenville
announced
the
servant
the
marquise
stood
up
rigid
and
motionless
but
at
the
sight
of
arthur
s
white
face
so
thin
and
haggard
how
was
it
possible
to
keep
up
the
show
of
severity
lord
grenville
saw
that
julie
was
not
alone
but
he
controlled
his
fierce
annoyance
and
looked
cool
and
unperturbed
yet
for
the
two
women
who
knew
his
secret
his
face
his
tones
the
look
in
his
eyes
had
something
of
the
power
attributed
to
the
torpedo
their
faculties
were
benumbed
by
the
sharp
shock
of
contact
with
his
horrible
pain
the
sound
of
his
voice
set
julie
s
heart
beating
so
cruelly
that
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
she
was
afraid
that
he
would
see
the
full
extent
of
his
power
over
her
lord
grenville
did
not
dare
to
look
at
julie
and
mme
de
wimphen
was
left
to
sustain
a
conversation
to
which
no
one
listened
julie
glanced
at
her
friend
with
touching
gratefulness
in
her
eyes
to
thank
her
for
coming
to
her
aid
by
this
time
the
lovers
had
quelled
emotion
into
silence
and
could
preserve
the
limits
laid
down
by
duty
and
convention
but
de
wimphen
was
announced
and
as
he
came
in
the
two
friends
exchanged
glances
both
felt
the
difficulties
of
this
fresh
complication
it
was
impossible
to
enter
into
explanations
with
de
wimphen
and
louisa
could
not
think
of
any
sufficient
pretext
for
asking
to
be
left
julie
went
to
her
ostensibly
to
wrap
her
up
in
her
shawl
i
will
be
brave
she
said
in
a
low
voice
he
came
here
in
the
face
of
all
the
world
so
what
have
i
to
fear
yet
but
for
you
in
that
first
moment
when
i
saw
how
changed
he
looked
i
should
have
fallen
at
his
well
arthur
you
have
broken
your
promise
to
me
she
said
in
a
faltering
voice
when
she
returned
lord
grenville
did
not
venture
to
take
the
seat
upon
the
sofa
by
her
side
i
could
not
resist
the
pleasure
of
hearing
your
voice
of
being
near
you
the
thought
of
it
came
to
be
a
sort
of
madness
a
delirious
frenzy
i
am
no
longer
master
of
myself
i
have
taken
myself
to
task
it
is
no
use
i
am
too
weak
i
ought
to
die
but
to
die
without
seeing
you
without
having
heard
the
rustle
of
your
dress
or
felt
your
tears
what
a
death
he
moved
further
away
from
her
but
in
his
hasty
uprising
a
pistol
fell
out
of
his
pocket
the
marquise
looked
down
blankly
at
the
weapon
all
passion
all
expression
had
died
out
of
her
eyes
lord
grenville
stooped
for
the
thing
raging
inwardly
over
an
accident
which
seemed
like
a
piece
of
lovesick
strategy
madame
he
said
looking
down
i
came
here
in
utter
desperation
i
meant
he
broke
off
you
meant
to
die
by
your
own
hand
here
in
my
house
not
alone
he
said
in
a
low
voice
not
alone
my
husband
perhaps
no
no
he
cried
in
a
choking
voice
reassure
yourself
he
continued
i
have
quite
given
up
my
deadly
purpose
as
soon
as
i
came
in
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
i
felt
that
i
was
strong
enough
to
suffer
in
silence
and
to
die
julie
sprang
up
and
flung
herself
into
his
arms
through
her
sobbing
he
caught
a
few
passionate
words
to
know
happiness
and
then
to
yes
let
it
be
all
julie
s
story
was
summed
up
in
that
cry
from
the
depths
it
was
the
summons
of
nature
and
of
love
at
which
women
without
a
religion
surrender
with
the
fierce
energy
of
joy
arthur
caught
her
up
and
carried
her
to
the
sofa
but
in
a
moment
she
tore
herself
from
her
lover
s
arms
looked
at
him
with
a
fixed
despairing
gaze
took
his
hand
snatched
up
a
candle
and
drew
him
into
her
room
when
they
stood
by
the
cot
where
helene
lay
sleeping
she
put
the
curtains
softly
aside
shading
the
candle
with
her
hand
lest
the
light
should
dazzle
the
eyes
beneath
the
transparent
lids
helene
lay
smiling
in
her
sleep
with
her
arms
outstretched
on
the
coverlet
julie
glanced
from
her
child
to
arthur
s
face
that
look
told
him
all
we
may
leave
a
husband
even
though
he
loves
us
a
man
is
strong
he
has
we
may
defy
the
world
and
its
laws
but
a
motherless
child
all
these
thoughts
and
a
thousand
others
more
moving
still
found
language
in
that
glance
we
can
take
her
with
us
muttered
he
i
will
love
her
mamma
cried
little
helene
now
awake
julie
burst
into
tears
lord
grenville
sat
down
and
folded
his
arms
in
gloomy
silence
mamma
at
the
sweet
childish
name
so
many
nobler
feelings
so
many
irresistible
yearnings
awoke
that
for
a
moment
love
was
effaced
by
the
instinct
of
motherhood
the
mother
triumphed
over
the
woman
in
julie
and
lord
grenville
could
not
hold
out
he
was
defeated
by
julie
s
tears
just
at
that
moment
a
door
was
flung
noisily
open
madame
d
aiglemont
are
you
hereabouts
called
a
voice
which
rang
like
a
crack
of
thunder
through
the
hearts
of
the
two
lovers
the
marquis
had
come
home
before
julie
could
recover
her
presence
of
mind
her
husband
was
on
the
way
to
the
door
of
her
room
which
opened
into
his
luckily
at
a
sign
lord
grenville
escaped
into
the
and
she
hastily
shut
the
door
upon
him
well
my
lady
here
am
i
said
victor
the
hunting
party
did
not
come
off
i
am
just
going
to
so
am
i
so
go
and
leave
me
to
you
are
very
cross
madame
la
the
general
returned
to
his
room
julie
went
with
him
to
the
door
and
shut
it
then
she
sprang
to
the
to
release
arthur
all
her
presence
of
mind
returned
she
bethought
herself
that
it
was
quite
natural
that
her
sometime
doctor
should
pay
her
a
visit
she
might
have
left
him
in
the
while
she
put
her
little
girl
to
bed
she
was
about
to
tell
him
under
her
breath
to
go
back
to
the
and
had
opened
the
door
then
she
shrieked
aloud
lord
grenville
s
fingers
had
been
caught
and
crushed
in
the
door
well
what
is
it
demanded
her
husband
oh
nothing
i
have
just
pricked
my
finger
with
a
the
general
s
door
opened
at
once
julie
imagined
that
the
irruption
was
due
to
a
sudden
concern
for
her
and
cursed
a
solicitude
in
which
love
had
no
part
she
had
barely
time
to
close
the
and
lord
grenville
had
not
extricated
his
hand
the
general
did
in
fact
appear
but
his
wife
had
mistaken
his
motives
his
apprehensions
were
entirely
on
his
own
account
can
you
lend
me
a
bandana
handkerchief
the
stupid
fool
charles
leaves
me
without
a
single
one
in
the
early
days
you
used
to
bother
me
with
looking
after
me
so
carefully
ah
well
the
honeymoon
did
not
last
very
long
for
me
nor
yet
for
my
cravats
nowadays
i
am
given
over
to
the
secular
arm
in
the
shape
of
servants
who
do
not
care
one
jack
straw
for
what
i
there
there
is
a
bandana
for
you
did
you
go
into
the
oh
you
might
perhaps
have
been
in
time
to
see
lord
is
he
in
paris
it
seems
oh
i
will
go
at
once
the
good
but
he
will
have
gone
by
now
exclaimed
julie
the
marquis
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
tying
the
handkerchief
over
his
head
he
looked
complacently
at
himself
in
the
glass
what
has
become
of
the
servants
is
more
than
i
know
he
remarked
i
have
rung
the
bell
for
charles
and
he
has
not
answered
it
and
your
maid
is
not
here
either
ring
for
her
i
should
like
another
blanket
on
my
bed
pauline
is
out
the
marquise
said
drily
what
at
midnight
exclaimed
the
general
i
gave
her
leave
to
go
to
the
that
is
funny
returned
her
husband
continuing
to
undress
i
thought
i
saw
her
coming
she
has
come
in
then
of
course
said
julie
with
assumed
impatience
and
to
allay
any
possible
suspicion
on
her
husband
s
part
she
pretended
to
ring
the
bell
the
whole
history
of
that
night
has
never
been
known
but
no
doubt
it
was
as
simple
and
as
tragically
commonplace
as
the
domestic
incidents
that
preceded
it
next
day
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
took
to
her
bed
nor
did
she
leave
it
for
some
days
what
can
have
happened
in
your
family
so
extraordinary
that
every
one
is
talking
about
your
wife
asked
de
ronquerolles
of
d
aiglemont
a
short
time
after
that
night
of
catastrophes
take
my
advice
and
remain
a
bachelor
said
d
aiglemont
the
curtains
of
helene
s
cot
caught
fire
and
gave
my
wife
such
a
shock
that
it
will
be
a
twelvemonth
before
she
gets
over
it
so
the
doctor
says
you
marry
a
pretty
wife
and
her
looks
fall
off
you
marry
a
girl
in
blooming
health
and
she
turns
into
an
invalid
you
think
she
has
a
passionate
temperament
and
find
her
cold
or
else
under
her
apparent
coldness
there
lurks
a
nature
so
passionate
that
she
is
the
death
of
you
or
she
dishonors
your
name
sometimes
the
meekest
of
them
will
turn
out
crotchety
though
the
crotchety
ones
never
grow
any
sweeter
sometimes
the
mere
child
so
simple
and
silly
at
first
will
develop
an
iron
will
to
thwart
you
and
the
ingenuity
of
a
fiend
i
am
tired
of
or
of
your
wife
that
would
be
difficult
do
you
feel
inclined
to
go
to
d
aquin
with
me
to
attend
lord
grenville
s
funeral
a
singular
way
of
spending
is
it
really
known
how
he
came
by
his
death
added
ronquerolles
his
man
says
that
he
spent
a
whole
night
sitting
on
somebody
s
window
sill
to
save
some
woman
s
character
and
it
has
been
infernally
cold
such
devotion
would
be
highly
creditable
to
one
of
us
old
stagers
but
lord
grenville
was
a
youngster
and
an
englishman
englishmen
never
can
do
anything
like
anybody
pooh
returned
d
aiglemont
these
heroic
exploits
all
depend
upon
the
woman
in
the
case
and
it
certainly
was
not
for
one
that
i
know
that
poor
arthur
came
by
his
ii
a
hidden
grief
between
the
seine
and
the
little
river
loing
lies
a
wide
flat
country
skirted
on
the
one
side
by
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
and
marked
out
as
to
its
southern
limits
by
the
towns
of
moret
montereau
and
nemours
it
is
a
dreary
country
little
knolls
of
hills
appear
only
at
rare
intervals
and
a
coppice
here
and
there
among
the
fields
affords
for
game
and
beyond
upon
every
side
stretches
the
endless
gray
or
yellowish
horizon
peculiar
to
beauce
sologne
and
berri
in
the
very
centre
of
the
plain
at
equal
distances
from
moret
and
montereau
the
traveler
passes
the
old
chateau
of
standing
amid
surroundings
which
lack
neither
dignity
nor
stateliness
there
are
magnificent
avenues
of
great
gardens
encircled
by
the
moat
and
a
circumference
of
walls
about
a
huge
manorial
pile
which
represents
the
profits
of
the
the
gains
of
legalized
malversation
or
the
vast
fortunes
of
great
houses
now
brought
low
beneath
the
hammer
of
the
civil
code
should
any
artist
or
dreamer
of
dreams
chance
to
stray
along
the
roads
full
of
deep
ruts
or
over
the
heavy
land
which
secures
the
place
against
intrusion
he
will
wonder
how
it
happened
that
this
romantic
old
place
was
set
down
in
a
savanna
of
a
desert
of
chalk
and
sand
and
marl
where
gaiety
dies
away
and
melancholy
is
a
natural
product
of
the
soil
the
voiceless
solitude
the
monotonous
horizon
line
which
weigh
upon
the
spirits
are
negative
beauties
which
only
suit
with
sorrow
that
refuses
to
be
comforted
hither
at
the
close
of
the
year
came
a
woman
still
young
well
known
in
paris
for
her
charm
her
fair
face
and
her
wit
and
to
the
immense
astonishment
of
the
little
village
a
mile
away
this
woman
of
high
rank
and
corresponding
fortune
took
up
her
abode
at
from
time
immemorial
farmers
and
laborers
had
seen
no
gentry
at
the
chateau
the
estate
considerable
though
it
was
had
been
left
in
charge
of
a
and
the
house
to
the
old
servants
wherefore
the
appearance
of
the
lady
of
the
manor
caused
a
kind
of
sensation
in
the
district
a
group
had
gathered
in
the
yard
of
the
wretched
little
wineshop
at
the
end
of
the
village
where
the
road
forks
to
nemours
and
moret
to
see
the
carriage
pass
it
went
by
slowly
for
the
marquise
had
come
from
paris
with
her
own
horses
and
those
on
the
lookout
had
ample
opportunity
of
observing
a
who
sat
with
her
back
to
the
horses
holding
a
little
girl
with
a
somewhat
dreamy
look
upon
her
knee
the
child
s
mother
lay
back
in
the
carriage
she
looked
like
a
dying
woman
sent
out
into
the
country
air
by
her
doctors
as
a
last
resource
village
politicians
were
by
no
means
pleased
to
see
the
young
delicate
downcast
face
they
had
hoped
that
the
new
arrival
at
would
bring
some
life
and
stir
into
the
neighborhood
and
clearly
any
sort
of
stir
or
movement
must
be
distasteful
to
the
suffering
invalid
in
the
traveling
carriage
that
evening
when
the
notables
of
were
drinking
in
the
private
room
of
the
wineshop
the
longest
head
among
them
declared
that
such
depression
could
admit
of
but
one
construction
the
marquise
was
ruined
his
lordship
the
marquis
was
away
in
spain
with
the
duc
d
angouleme
so
they
said
in
the
papers
and
beyond
a
doubt
her
ladyship
had
come
to
to
retrench
after
a
run
of
on
the
bourse
the
marquis
was
one
of
the
greatest
gamblers
on
the
face
of
the
globe
perhaps
the
estate
would
be
cut
up
and
sold
in
little
lots
there
would
be
some
good
strokes
of
business
to
be
made
in
that
case
and
it
behooved
everybody
to
count
up
his
cash
unearth
his
savings
and
to
see
how
he
stood
so
as
to
secure
his
share
of
the
spoil
of
so
fair
did
this
future
seem
that
the
village
worthies
dying
to
know
whether
it
was
founded
on
fact
began
to
think
of
ways
of
getting
at
the
truth
through
the
servants
at
the
chateau
none
of
these
however
could
throw
any
light
on
the
calamity
which
had
brought
their
mistress
into
the
country
at
the
beginning
of
winter
and
to
the
old
chateau
of
of
all
places
when
she
might
have
taken
her
choice
of
cheerful
famous
for
their
beautiful
gardens
his
worship
the
mayor
called
to
pay
his
respects
but
he
did
not
see
the
lady
then
the
tried
with
no
better
success
madame
la
marquise
kept
her
room
only
leaving
it
while
it
was
set
in
order
for
the
small
adjoining
where
she
dined
if
indeed
to
sit
down
to
a
table
to
look
with
disgust
at
the
dishes
and
take
the
precise
amount
of
nourishment
required
to
prevent
death
from
sheer
starvation
can
be
called
dining
the
meal
over
she
returned
at
once
to
the
low
chair
in
which
she
had
sat
since
the
morning
in
the
embrasure
of
the
one
window
that
lighted
her
room
her
little
girl
she
only
saw
for
a
few
minutes
daily
during
the
dismal
dinner
and
even
for
a
short
time
she
seemed
scarcely
able
to
bear
the
child
s
presence
surely
nothing
but
the
most
anguish
could
have
extinguished
a
mother
s
love
so
early
none
of
the
servants
were
suffered
to
come
near
her
own
woman
was
the
one
creature
whom
she
liked
to
have
about
her
the
chateau
must
be
perfectly
quiet
the
child
must
play
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
the
slightest
sound
had
grown
so
intolerable
that
any
human
voice
even
the
voice
of
her
own
child
jarred
upon
her
at
first
the
whole
countryside
was
deeply
interested
in
these
eccentricities
but
time
passed
on
every
possible
hypothesis
had
been
advanced
to
account
for
them
and
the
peasants
and
dwellers
in
the
little
country
towns
thought
no
more
of
the
invalid
lady
so
the
marquise
was
left
to
herself
she
might
live
on
perfectly
silent
amid
the
silence
which
she
herself
had
created
there
was
nothing
to
draw
her
forth
from
the
tapestried
chamber
where
her
grandmother
died
whither
she
herself
had
come
that
she
might
die
gently
without
witnesses
without
importunate
solicitude
without
suffering
from
the
insincere
demonstrations
of
egoism
masquerading
as
affection
which
double
the
agony
of
death
in
great
cities
she
was
years
old
at
that
age
with
plenty
of
romantic
illusions
still
left
the
mind
loves
to
dwell
on
the
thought
of
death
when
death
seems
to
come
as
a
friend
but
with
youth
death
is
coy
coming
up
close
only
to
go
away
showing
himself
and
hiding
again
till
youth
has
time
to
fall
out
of
love
with
him
during
this
dalliance
there
is
that
uncertainty
too
that
hangs
over
death
s
youth
plunges
back
into
the
world
of
living
men
there
to
find
the
pain
more
pitiless
than
death
that
does
not
wait
to
strike
this
woman
who
refused
to
live
was
to
know
the
bitterness
of
these
reprieves
in
the
depths
of
her
loneliness
in
moral
agony
which
death
would
not
come
to
end
she
was
to
serve
a
terrible
apprenticeship
to
the
egoism
which
must
take
the
bloom
from
her
heart
and
break
her
in
to
the
life
of
the
world
this
harsh
and
sorry
teaching
is
the
usual
outcome
of
our
early
sorrows
for
the
first
and
perhaps
for
the
last
time
in
her
life
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
was
in
very
truth
suffering
and
indeed
would
it
not
be
an
error
to
suppose
that
the
same
sentiment
can
be
reproduced
in
us
once
develop
the
power
to
feel
is
it
not
always
there
in
the
depths
of
our
nature
the
accidents
of
life
may
lull
or
awaken
it
but
there
it
is
of
necessity
modifying
the
self
its
abiding
place
hence
every
sensation
should
have
its
great
day
once
and
for
all
its
first
day
of
storm
be
it
long
or
short
hence
likewise
pain
the
most
abiding
of
our
sensations
could
be
keenly
felt
only
at
its
first
irruption
its
intensity
diminishing
with
every
subsequent
paroxysm
either
because
we
grow
accustomed
to
these
crises
or
perhaps
because
a
natural
instinct
of
asserts
itself
and
opposes
to
the
destroying
force
of
anguish
an
equal
but
passive
force
of
inertia
yet
of
all
kinds
of
suffering
to
which
does
the
name
of
anguish
belong
for
the
loss
of
parents
nature
has
in
a
manner
prepared
us
physical
suffering
again
is
an
evil
which
passes
over
us
and
is
gone
it
lays
no
hold
upon
the
soul
if
it
persists
it
ceases
to
be
an
evil
it
is
death
the
young
mother
loses
her
firstborn
but
wedded
love
ere
long
gives
her
a
successor
this
grief
too
is
transient
after
all
these
and
many
other
troubles
like
unto
them
are
in
some
sort
wounds
and
bruises
they
do
not
sap
the
springs
of
vitality
and
only
a
succession
of
such
blows
can
crush
in
us
the
instinct
that
seeks
happiness
great
pain
therefore
pain
that
arises
to
anguish
should
be
suffering
so
deadly
that
past
present
and
future
are
alike
included
in
its
grip
and
no
part
of
life
is
left
sound
and
whole
never
afterwards
can
we
think
the
same
thoughts
as
before
anguish
engraves
itself
in
ineffaceable
characters
on
mouth
and
brow
it
passes
through
us
destroying
or
relaxing
the
springs
that
vibrate
to
enjoyment
leaving
behind
in
the
soul
the
seeds
of
a
disgust
for
all
things
in
this
world
yet
again
to
be
measureless
to
weigh
like
this
upon
body
and
soul
the
trouble
should
befall
when
soul
and
body
have
just
come
to
their
full
strength
and
smite
down
a
heart
that
beats
high
with
life
then
it
is
that
great
scars
are
made
terrible
is
the
anguish
none
it
may
be
can
issue
from
this
without
undergoing
some
dramatic
change
those
who
survive
it
those
who
remain
on
earth
return
to
the
world
to
wear
an
actor
s
countenance
and
to
play
an
actor
s
part
they
know
the
where
actors
may
retire
to
calculate
chances
shed
their
tears
or
pass
their
jests
life
holds
no
inscrutable
dark
places
for
those
who
have
passed
through
this
ordeal
their
judgments
are
rhadamanthine
for
young
women
of
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
s
age
this
first
this
most
poignant
pain
of
all
is
always
referable
to
the
same
cause
a
woman
especially
if
she
is
a
young
woman
greatly
beautiful
and
by
nature
great
never
fails
to
stake
her
whole
life
as
instinct
and
sentiment
and
society
all
unite
to
bid
her
suppose
that
that
life
fails
her
suppose
that
she
still
lives
on
she
can
not
but
endure
the
most
cruel
pangs
inasmuch
as
a
first
love
is
the
loveliest
of
all
how
comes
it
that
this
catastrophe
has
found
no
painter
no
poet
and
yet
can
it
be
painted
can
it
be
sung
no
for
the
anguish
arising
from
it
eludes
analysis
and
defies
the
colors
of
art
and
more
than
this
such
pain
is
never
confessed
to
console
the
sufferer
you
must
be
able
to
divine
the
past
which
she
hugs
in
bitterness
to
her
soul
like
a
remorse
it
is
like
an
avalanche
in
a
valley
it
laid
all
waste
before
it
found
a
permanent
the
marquise
was
suffering
from
this
anguish
which
will
for
long
remain
unknown
because
the
whole
world
condemns
it
while
sentiment
cherishes
it
and
the
conscience
of
a
true
woman
justifies
her
in
it
it
is
with
such
pain
as
with
children
steadily
disowned
of
life
and
therefore
bound
more
closely
to
the
mother
s
heart
than
other
children
more
bounteously
endowed
never
perhaps
was
the
awful
catastrophe
in
which
the
whole
world
without
dies
for
us
so
deadly
so
complete
so
cruelly
aggravated
by
circumstance
as
it
had
been
for
the
marquise
the
man
whom
she
had
loved
was
young
and
generous
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
the
world
she
had
refused
herself
to
his
love
and
he
had
died
to
save
a
woman
s
honor
as
the
world
calls
it
to
whom
could
she
speak
of
her
misery
her
tears
would
be
an
offence
against
her
husband
the
origin
of
the
tragedy
by
all
laws
written
and
unwritten
she
was
bound
over
to
silence
a
woman
would
have
enjoyed
the
story
a
man
would
have
schemed
for
his
own
benefit
no
such
grief
as
hers
can
only
weep
freely
in
solitude
and
in
loneliness
she
must
consume
her
pain
or
be
consumed
by
it
die
or
kill
something
within
her
her
conscience
it
may
be
day
after
day
she
sat
gazing
at
the
flat
horizon
it
lay
out
before
her
like
her
own
life
to
come
there
was
nothing
to
discover
nothing
to
hope
the
whole
of
it
could
be
seen
at
a
glance
it
was
the
visible
presentment
in
the
outward
world
of
the
chill
sense
of
desolation
which
was
gnawing
restlessly
at
her
heart
the
misty
mornings
the
pale
bright
sky
the
low
clouds
scudding
under
the
gray
dome
of
heaven
fitted
with
the
moods
of
her
her
heart
did
not
contract
was
neither
more
nor
less
seared
rather
it
seemed
as
if
her
youth
in
its
full
blossom
was
slowly
turned
to
stone
by
an
anguish
intolerable
because
it
was
barren
she
suffered
through
herself
and
for
herself
how
could
it
end
save
in
ugly
torturing
thoughts
probed
her
conscience
candid
pronounced
that
she
was
double
there
were
two
selves
within
her
a
woman
who
felt
and
a
woman
who
thought
a
self
that
suffered
and
a
self
that
could
fain
suffer
no
longer
her
mind
traveled
back
to
the
joys
of
childish
days
they
had
gone
by
and
she
had
never
known
how
happy
they
were
scenes
crowded
up
in
her
memory
as
in
a
bright
mirror
glass
to
demonstrate
the
deception
of
a
marriage
which
all
that
it
should
be
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
was
in
reality
wretched
what
had
the
delicate
pride
of
young
womanhood
done
for
her
the
bliss
foregone
the
sacrifices
made
to
the
world
everything
in
her
expressed
love
awaited
love
her
movements
still
were
full
of
perfect
grace
her
smile
her
charm
were
hers
as
before
why
she
asked
herself
the
sense
of
her
own
youth
and
physical
loveliness
no
more
affected
her
than
some
meaningless
reiterated
sound
her
very
beauty
had
grown
intolerable
to
her
as
a
useless
thing
she
shrank
aghast
from
the
thought
that
through
the
rest
of
life
she
must
remain
an
incomplete
creature
had
not
the
inner
self
lost
its
power
of
receiving
impressions
with
that
zest
that
exquisite
sense
of
freshness
which
is
the
spring
of
so
much
of
life
s
gladness
the
impressions
of
the
future
would
for
the
most
part
be
effaced
as
soon
as
received
and
many
of
the
thoughts
which
once
would
have
moved
her
now
would
move
her
no
more
after
the
childhood
of
the
creature
dawns
the
childhood
of
the
heart
but
this
second
infancy
was
over
her
lover
had
taken
it
down
with
him
into
the
grave
the
longings
of
youth
remained
she
was
young
yet
but
the
completeness
of
youth
was
gone
and
with
that
lost
completeness
the
whole
value
and
savor
of
life
had
diminished
somewhat
should
she
not
always
bear
within
her
the
seeds
of
sadness
and
mistrust
ready
to
grow
up
and
rob
emotion
of
its
springtide
of
fervor
conscious
she
must
always
be
that
nothing
could
give
her
now
the
happiness
so
longed
for
that
seemed
so
fair
in
her
dreams
the
fire
from
heaven
that
sheds
abroad
its
light
in
the
heart
in
the
dawn
of
love
had
been
quenched
in
tears
the
first
real
tears
which
she
had
shed
henceforth
she
must
always
suffer
because
it
was
no
longer
in
her
power
to
be
what
once
she
might
have
been
this
is
a
belief
which
turns
us
in
aversion
and
bitterness
of
spirit
from
any
proffered
new
delight
julie
had
come
to
look
at
life
from
the
point
of
view
of
age
about
to
die
young
though
she
felt
the
heavy
weight
of
joyless
days
had
fallen
upon
her
and
left
her
and
old
before
her
time
with
a
despairing
cry
she
asked
the
world
what
it
could
give
her
in
exchange
for
the
love
now
lost
by
which
she
had
lived
she
asked
herself
whether
in
that
vanished
love
so
chaste
and
pure
her
will
had
not
been
more
criminal
than
her
deeds
and
chose
to
believe
herself
guilty
partly
to
affront
the
world
partly
for
her
own
consolation
in
that
she
had
missed
the
close
union
of
body
and
soul
which
diminishes
the
pain
of
the
one
who
is
left
behind
by
the
knowledge
that
once
it
has
known
and
given
joy
to
the
full
and
retains
within
itself
the
impress
of
that
which
is
no
more
something
of
the
mortification
of
the
actress
cheated
of
her
part
mingled
with
the
pain
which
thrilled
through
every
fibre
of
her
heart
and
brain
her
nature
had
been
thwarted
her
vanity
wounded
her
woman
s
generosity
cheated
of
then
when
she
had
raised
all
these
questions
set
vibrating
all
the
springs
in
those
different
phases
of
being
which
we
distinguish
as
social
moral
and
physical
her
energies
were
so
far
exhausted
and
relaxed
that
she
was
powerless
to
grasp
a
single
thought
amid
the
chase
of
conflicting
ideas
sometimes
as
the
mists
fell
she
would
throw
her
window
open
and
would
stay
there
motionless
breathing
in
unheedingly
the
damp
earthly
scent
in
the
air
her
mind
to
all
appearance
an
unintelligent
blank
for
the
ceaseless
burden
of
sorrow
humming
in
her
brain
left
her
deaf
to
earth
s
harmonies
and
insensible
to
the
delights
of
thought
one
day
towards
noon
when
the
sun
shone
out
for
a
little
her
maid
came
in
without
a
summons
this
is
the
fourth
time
that
le
cure
has
come
to
see
mme
la
marquise
he
is
so
determined
about
it
that
we
did
not
know
what
to
tell
he
has
come
to
ask
for
some
money
for
the
poor
no
doubt
take
him
louis
from
the
woman
went
only
to
return
m
le
cure
will
not
take
the
money
my
lady
he
wants
to
speak
to
then
let
him
come
said
mme
d
aiglemont
with
an
involuntary
shrug
which
augured
ill
for
the
priest
s
reception
evidently
the
lady
meant
to
put
a
stop
to
persecution
by
a
short
and
sharp
method
mme
d
aiglemont
had
lost
her
mother
in
her
early
childhood
and
as
a
natural
consequence
in
her
she
had
felt
the
influence
of
the
relaxed
notions
which
loosened
the
hold
of
religion
upon
france
during
the
revolution
piety
is
a
womanly
virtue
which
women
alone
can
really
instil
and
the
marquise
a
child
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
adopted
her
father
s
creed
of
philosophism
and
practised
no
religious
observances
a
priest
to
her
way
of
thinking
was
a
civil
servant
of
very
doubtful
utility
in
her
present
position
the
teaching
of
religion
could
only
poison
her
wounds
she
had
moreover
but
scanty
faith
in
the
lights
of
country
cures
and
made
up
her
mind
to
put
this
one
gently
but
firmly
in
his
place
and
to
rid
herself
of
him
after
the
manner
of
the
rich
by
bestowing
a
benefit
at
first
sight
of
the
cure
the
marquise
felt
no
inclination
to
change
her
mind
she
saw
before
her
a
stout
rotund
little
man
with
a
ruddy
wrinkled
elderly
face
which
awkwardly
and
unsuccessfully
tried
to
smile
his
bald
forehead
furrowed
by
intersecting
lines
was
too
heavy
for
the
rest
of
his
face
which
seemed
to
be
dwarfed
by
it
a
fringe
of
scanty
white
hair
encircled
the
back
of
his
head
and
almost
reached
his
ears
yet
the
priest
looked
as
if
by
nature
he
had
a
genial
disposition
his
thick
lips
his
slightly
curved
nose
his
chin
which
vanished
in
a
double
fold
of
wrinkles
all
marked
him
out
as
a
man
who
took
cheerful
views
of
life
at
first
the
marquise
saw
nothing
but
these
salient
characteristics
but
at
the
first
word
she
was
struck
by
the
sweetness
of
the
speaker
s
voice
looking
at
him
more
closely
she
saw
that
the
eyes
under
the
grizzled
eyebrows
had
shed
tears
and
his
face
turned
in
profile
wore
so
sublime
an
impress
of
sorrow
that
the
marquise
recognized
the
man
in
the
cure
madame
la
marquise
the
rich
only
come
within
our
province
when
they
are
in
trouble
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
troubles
of
a
young
beautiful
and
wealthy
woman
who
has
lost
neither
children
nor
relatives
are
caused
by
wounds
whose
pangs
religion
alone
can
soothe
your
soul
is
in
danger
madame
i
am
not
speaking
now
of
the
hereafter
which
awaits
us
no
i
am
not
in
the
confessional
but
it
is
my
duty
is
it
not
to
open
your
eyes
to
your
future
life
here
on
earth
you
will
pardon
an
old
man
will
you
not
for
importunity
which
has
your
own
happiness
for
its
object
there
is
no
more
happiness
for
me
monsieur
i
shall
soon
be
as
you
say
in
your
province
but
it
will
be
for
nay
madame
you
will
not
die
of
this
pain
which
lies
heavy
upon
you
and
can
be
read
in
your
face
if
you
had
been
destined
to
die
of
it
you
would
not
be
here
at
a
definite
regret
is
not
so
deadly
as
hope
deferred
i
have
known
others
pass
through
more
intolerable
and
more
awful
anguish
and
yet
they
the
marquise
looked
incredulous
madame
i
know
a
man
whose
affliction
was
so
sore
that
your
trouble
would
seem
to
you
to
be
light
compared
with
perhaps
the
long
solitary
hours
had
begun
to
hang
heavily
perhaps
in
the
recesses
of
the
marquise
s
mind
lay
the
thought
that
here
was
a
friendly
heart
to
whom
she
might
be
able
to
pour
out
her
troubles
however
it
was
she
gave
the
cure
a
questioning
glance
which
could
not
be
mistaken
madame
he
continued
the
man
of
whom
i
tell
you
had
but
three
children
left
of
a
once
large
family
circle
he
lost
his
parents
his
daughter
and
his
wife
whom
he
dearly
loved
he
was
left
alone
at
last
on
the
little
farm
where
he
had
lived
so
happily
for
so
long
his
three
sons
were
in
the
army
and
each
of
the
lads
had
risen
in
proportion
to
his
time
of
service
during
the
hundred
days
the
oldest
went
into
the
guard
with
a
colonel
s
commission
the
second
was
a
major
in
the
artillery
the
youngest
a
major
in
a
regiment
of
dragoons
madame
those
three
boys
loved
their
father
as
much
as
he
loved
them
if
you
but
knew
how
careless
young
fellows
grow
of
home
ties
when
they
are
carried
away
by
the
current
of
their
own
lives
you
would
realize
from
this
one
little
thing
how
warmly
they
loved
the
lonely
old
father
who
only
lived
in
and
for
them
never
a
week
passed
without
a
letter
from
one
of
the
boys
but
then
he
on
his
side
had
never
been
weakly
indulgent
to
lessen
their
respect
for
him
nor
unjustly
severe
to
thwart
their
affection
or
apt
to
grudge
sacrifices
the
thing
that
estranges
children
s
hearts
he
had
been
more
than
a
father
he
had
been
a
brother
to
them
and
their
friend
at
last
he
went
to
paris
to
bid
them
before
they
set
out
for
belgium
he
wished
to
see
that
they
had
good
horses
and
all
that
they
needed
and
so
they
went
and
the
father
returned
to
his
home
again
then
the
war
began
he
had
letters
from
fleurus
and
again
from
ligny
all
went
well
then
came
the
battle
of
waterloo
and
you
know
the
rest
france
was
plunged
into
mourning
every
family
waited
in
intense
anxiety
for
news
you
may
imagine
madame
how
the
old
man
waited
for
tidings
in
anxiety
that
knew
no
peace
nor
rest
he
used
to
read
the
gazettes
he
went
to
the
coach
office
every
day
one
evening
he
was
told
that
the
colonel
s
servant
had
come
the
man
was
riding
his
master
s
horse
what
need
was
there
to
ask
any
questions
the
colonel
was
dead
cut
in
two
by
a
shell
before
the
evening
was
out
the
youngest
son
s
servant
arrived
the
youngest
had
died
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
at
midnight
came
a
gunner
with
tidings
of
the
death
of
the
last
upon
whom
in
those
few
hours
the
poor
father
had
centered
all
his
life
madame
they
all
had
after
a
pause
the
good
man
controlled
his
feelings
and
added
gently
and
their
father
is
still
living
madame
he
realized
that
if
god
had
left
him
on
earth
he
was
bound
to
live
on
and
suffer
on
earth
but
he
took
refuge
in
the
sanctuary
what
could
he
be
the
marquise
looked
up
and
saw
the
cure
s
face
grown
sublime
in
its
sorrow
and
resignation
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
when
the
words
came
tears
broke
from
her
a
priest
madame
consecrated
by
his
own
tears
previously
shed
at
the
foot
of
the
silence
prevailed
for
a
little
the
marquise
and
the
cure
looked
out
at
the
foggy
landscape
as
if
they
could
see
the
figures
of
those
who
were
no
more
not
a
priest
in
a
city
but
a
simple
country
cure
added
he
at
she
said
drying
her
eyes
yes
never
had
the
majesty
of
grief
seemed
so
great
to
julie
the
two
words
sank
straight
into
her
heart
with
the
weight
of
infinite
sorrow
the
gentle
sonorous
tones
troubled
her
heart
ah
that
full
deep
voice
charged
with
plangent
vibration
was
the
voice
of
one
who
had
suffered
indeed
and
if
i
do
not
die
monsieur
what
will
become
of
me
the
marquise
spoke
almost
reverently
have
you
not
a
child
madame
yes
she
said
stiffly
the
cure
gave
her
such
a
glance
as
a
doctor
gives
a
patient
whose
life
is
in
danger
then
he
determined
to
do
all
that
in
him
lay
to
combat
the
evil
spirit
into
whose
clutches
she
had
fallen
we
must
live
on
with
our
sorrows
you
see
it
yourself
madame
and
religion
alone
offers
us
real
consolation
will
you
permit
me
to
come
again
to
speak
to
you
as
a
man
who
can
sympathize
with
every
trouble
a
man
about
whom
there
is
nothing
very
alarming
i
think
yes
monsieur
come
back
again
thank
you
for
your
thought
of
very
well
madame
then
i
shall
return
very
this
visit
relaxed
the
tension
of
soul
as
it
were
the
heavy
strain
of
grief
and
loneliness
had
been
almost
too
much
for
the
marquise
s
strength
the
priest
s
visit
had
left
a
soothing
balm
in
her
heart
his
words
thrilled
through
her
with
healing
influence
she
began
to
feel
something
of
a
prisoner
s
satisfaction
when
after
he
has
had
time
to
feel
his
utter
loneliness
and
the
weight
of
his
chains
he
hears
a
neighbor
knocking
on
the
wall
and
welcomes
the
sound
which
brings
a
sense
of
human
friendship
here
was
an
confidant
but
this
feeling
did
not
last
for
long
soon
she
sank
back
into
the
old
bitterness
of
spirit
saying
to
herself
as
the
prisoner
might
say
that
a
companion
in
misfortune
could
neither
lighten
her
own
bondage
nor
her
future
in
the
first
visit
the
cure
had
feared
to
alarm
the
susceptibilities
of
grief
in
a
second
interview
he
hoped
to
make
some
progress
towards
religion
he
came
back
again
two
days
later
and
from
the
marquise
s
welcome
it
was
plain
that
she
had
looked
forward
to
the
visit
well
mme
la
marquise
have
you
given
a
little
thought
to
the
great
mass
of
human
suffering
have
you
raised
your
eyes
above
our
earth
and
seen
the
immensity
of
the
universe
the
worlds
beyond
worlds
which
crush
our
vanity
into
insignificance
and
with
our
vanity
reduce
our
sorrows
no
monsieur
she
said
i
can
not
rise
to
such
heights
our
social
laws
lie
too
heavily
upon
me
and
rend
my
heart
with
a
too
poignant
anguish
and
laws
perhaps
are
less
cruel
than
the
usages
of
the
world
ah
the
world
madame
we
must
obey
both
law
is
the
doctrine
and
custom
the
practice
of
obey
society
cried
the
marquise
with
an
involuntary
shudder
eh
monsieur
it
is
the
source
of
all
our
woes
god
laid
down
no
law
to
make
us
miserable
but
mankind
uniting
together
in
social
life
have
perverted
god
s
work
civilization
deals
harder
measure
to
us
women
than
nature
does
nature
imposes
upon
us
physical
suffering
which
you
have
not
alleviated
civilization
has
developed
in
us
thoughts
and
feelings
which
you
cheat
continually
nature
exterminates
the
weak
you
condemn
them
to
live
and
by
so
doing
consign
them
to
a
life
of
misery
the
whole
weight
of
the
burden
of
marriage
an
institution
on
which
society
is
based
falls
upon
us
for
the
man
liberty
duties
for
the
woman
we
must
give
up
our
whole
lives
to
you
you
are
only
bound
to
give
us
a
few
moments
of
yours
a
man
in
fact
makes
a
choice
while
we
blindly
submit
oh
monsieur
to
you
i
can
speak
freely
marriage
in
these
days
seems
to
me
to
be
legalized
prostitution
this
is
the
cause
of
my
wretchedness
but
among
so
many
miserable
creatures
so
unhappily
yoked
i
alone
am
bound
to
be
silent
i
alone
am
to
blame
for
my
misery
my
marriage
was
my
own
she
stopped
short
and
bitter
tears
fell
in
the
silence
in
the
depths
of
my
wretchedness
in
the
midst
of
this
sea
of
distress
she
went
on
i
found
some
sands
on
which
to
set
foot
and
suffer
at
leisure
a
great
tempest
swept
everything
away
and
here
am
i
helpless
and
alone
too
weak
to
cope
with
we
are
never
weak
while
god
is
with
us
said
the
priest
and
if
your
cravings
for
affection
can
not
be
satisfied
here
on
earth
have
you
no
duties
to
perform
duties
continually
she
exclaimed
with
something
of
impatience
in
her
tone
but
where
for
me
are
the
sentiments
which
give
us
strength
to
perform
them
nothing
from
nothing
nothing
for
nothing
this
monsieur
is
one
of
the
most
inexorable
laws
of
nature
physical
or
spiritual
would
you
have
these
trees
break
into
leaf
without
the
sap
which
swells
the
buds
it
is
the
same
with
our
human
nature
and
in
me
the
sap
is
dried
up
at
its
i
am
not
going
to
speak
to
you
of
religious
sentiments
of
which
resignation
is
born
said
the
cure
but
of
motherhood
madame
surely
stop
monsieur
said
the
marquise
with
you
i
will
be
sincere
alas
in
future
i
can
be
sincere
with
no
one
i
am
condemned
to
falsehood
the
world
requires
continual
grimaces
and
we
are
bidden
to
obey
its
conventions
if
we
would
escape
reproach
there
are
two
kinds
of
motherhood
monsieur
once
i
knew
nothing
of
such
distinctions
but
i
know
them
now
only
half
of
me
has
become
a
mother
it
were
better
for
me
if
i
had
not
been
a
mother
at
all
helene
is
not
child
oh
do
not
start
at
there
are
volcanic
depths
whence
come
lurid
gleams
of
light
and
earthquake
shocks
to
shake
the
fragile
edifices
of
laws
not
based
on
nature
i
have
borne
a
child
that
is
enough
i
am
a
mother
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
but
you
monsieur
with
your
delicately
compassionate
soul
can
perhaps
understand
this
cry
from
an
unhappy
woman
who
has
suffered
no
lying
illusions
to
enter
her
heart
god
will
judge
me
but
surely
i
have
only
obeyed
his
laws
by
giving
way
to
the
affections
which
he
himself
set
in
me
and
this
i
have
learned
from
my
own
what
is
a
child
monsieur
but
the
image
of
two
beings
the
fruit
of
two
sentiments
spontaneously
blended
unless
it
is
owned
by
every
fibre
of
the
body
as
by
every
chord
of
tenderness
in
the
heart
unless
it
recalls
the
bliss
of
love
the
hours
the
places
where
two
creatures
were
happy
their
words
that
overflowed
with
the
music
of
humanity
and
their
sweet
imaginings
that
child
is
an
incomplete
creation
yes
those
two
should
find
the
poetic
dreams
of
their
intimate
double
life
realized
in
their
child
as
in
an
exquisite
miniature
it
should
be
for
them
a
spring
of
emotion
implying
their
whole
past
and
their
whole
future
my
poor
little
helene
is
her
father
s
child
the
offspring
of
duty
and
of
chance
in
me
she
finds
nothing
but
the
affection
of
instinct
the
woman
s
natural
compassion
for
the
child
of
her
womb
socially
speaking
i
am
above
reproach
have
i
not
sacrificed
my
life
and
my
happiness
to
my
child
her
cries
go
to
my
heart
if
she
were
to
fall
into
the
water
i
should
spring
to
save
her
but
she
is
not
in
my
heart
ah
love
set
me
dreaming
of
a
motherhood
far
greater
and
more
complete
in
a
vanished
dream
i
held
in
my
arms
a
child
conceived
in
desire
before
it
was
begotten
the
exquisite
flower
of
life
that
blossoms
in
the
soul
before
it
sees
the
light
of
day
i
am
helene
s
mother
only
in
the
sense
that
i
brought
her
forth
when
she
needs
me
no
longer
there
will
be
an
end
of
my
motherhood
with
the
extinction
of
the
cause
the
effects
will
cease
if
it
is
a
woman
s
adorable
prerogative
that
her
motherhood
may
last
through
her
child
s
life
surely
that
divine
persistence
of
sentiment
is
due
to
the
glory
of
the
conception
of
the
soul
unless
a
child
has
lain
wrapped
about
from
life
s
first
beginnings
by
the
mother
s
soul
the
instinct
of
motherhood
dies
in
her
as
in
the
animals
this
is
true
i
feel
that
it
is
true
as
my
poor
little
one
grows
older
my
heart
closes
my
sacrifices
have
driven
us
apart
and
yet
i
know
monsieur
that
to
another
child
my
heart
would
have
gone
out
in
inexhaustible
love
for
that
other
i
should
not
have
known
what
sacrifice
meant
all
had
been
delight
in
this
monsieur
my
instincts
are
stronger
than
reason
stronger
than
religion
or
all
else
in
me
does
the
woman
who
is
neither
wife
nor
mother
sin
in
wishing
to
die
when
for
her
misfortune
she
has
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
infinite
beauty
of
love
the
limitless
joy
of
motherhood
what
can
become
of
her
can
tell
you
what
she
feels
i
can
not
put
that
memory
from
me
so
resolutely
but
that
a
hundred
times
night
and
day
visions
of
a
happiness
greater
it
may
be
than
the
reality
rise
before
me
followed
by
a
shudder
which
shakes
brain
and
heart
and
body
before
these
cruel
visions
my
feelings
and
thoughts
grow
colorless
and
i
ask
myself
what
would
my
life
have
been
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
burst
into
tears
there
you
see
the
depths
of
my
heart
she
continued
for
child
i
could
have
acquiesced
in
any
lot
however
dreadful
he
who
died
bearing
the
burden
of
the
sins
of
the
world
will
forgive
this
thought
of
which
i
am
dying
but
the
world
i
know
is
merciless
in
its
ears
my
words
are
blasphemies
i
am
outraging
all
its
codes
oh
that
i
could
wage
war
against
this
world
and
break
down
and
refashion
its
laws
and
traditions
has
it
not
turned
all
my
thoughts
and
feelings
and
longings
and
hopes
and
every
fibre
in
me
into
so
many
sources
of
pain
spoiled
my
future
present
and
past
for
me
the
daylight
is
full
of
gloom
my
thoughts
pierce
me
like
a
sword
my
child
is
and
is
not
oh
when
helene
speaks
to
me
i
wish
that
her
voice
were
different
when
she
looks
into
my
face
i
wish
that
she
had
other
eyes
she
constantly
keeps
me
in
mind
of
all
that
should
have
been
and
is
not
i
can
not
bear
to
have
her
near
me
i
smile
at
her
i
try
to
make
up
to
her
for
the
real
affection
of
which
she
is
defrauded
i
am
wretched
monsieur
too
wretched
to
live
and
i
am
supposed
to
be
a
pattern
wife
and
i
have
committed
no
sins
and
i
am
respected
i
have
fought
down
forbidden
love
which
sprang
up
at
unawares
within
me
but
if
i
have
kept
the
letter
of
the
law
have
i
kept
it
in
my
heart
there
has
never
been
but
one
here
she
said
laying
her
right
hand
on
her
breast
one
and
no
other
and
my
child
feels
it
certain
looks
and
tones
and
gestures
mould
a
child
s
nature
and
my
poor
little
one
feels
no
thrill
in
the
arm
i
put
about
her
no
tremor
comes
into
my
voice
no
softness
into
my
eyes
when
i
speak
to
her
or
take
her
up
she
looks
at
me
and
i
can
not
endure
the
reproach
in
her
eyes
there
are
times
when
i
shudder
to
think
that
some
day
she
may
be
my
judge
and
condemn
her
mother
unheard
heaven
grant
that
hate
may
not
grow
up
between
us
ah
god
in
heaven
rather
let
the
tomb
open
for
me
rather
let
me
end
my
days
here
at
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
world
where
i
shall
find
my
other
soul
and
become
wholly
a
mother
ah
forgive
me
sir
i
am
mad
those
words
were
choking
me
now
they
are
spoken
ah
you
are
weeping
too
you
will
not
despise
me
she
heard
the
child
come
in
from
a
walk
helene
my
child
come
here
she
called
the
words
sounded
like
a
cry
of
despair
the
little
girl
ran
in
laughing
and
calling
to
her
mother
to
see
a
butterfly
which
she
had
caught
but
at
the
sight
of
that
mother
s
tears
she
grew
quiet
of
a
sudden
and
went
up
close
and
received
a
kiss
on
her
forehead
she
will
be
very
beautiful
some
day
said
the
priest
she
is
her
father
s
child
said
the
marquise
kissing
the
little
one
with
eager
warmth
as
if
she
meant
to
pay
a
debt
of
affection
or
to
extinguish
some
feeling
of
remorse
how
hot
you
are
mamma
there
go
away
my
angel
said
the
marquise
the
child
went
she
did
not
seem
at
all
sorry
to
go
she
did
not
look
back
glad
perhaps
to
escape
from
a
sad
face
and
instinctively
comprehending
already
an
antagonism
of
feeling
in
its
expression
a
mother
s
love
finds
language
in
smiles
they
are
a
part
of
the
divine
right
of
motherhood
the
marquise
could
not
smile
she
flushed
red
as
she
felt
the
cure
s
eyes
she
had
hoped
to
act
a
mother
s
part
before
him
but
neither
she
nor
her
child
could
deceive
him
and
indeed
when
a
woman
loves
sincerely
in
the
kiss
she
gives
there
is
a
divine
honey
it
is
as
if
a
soul
were
breathed
forth
in
the
caress
a
subtle
flame
of
fire
which
brings
warmth
to
the
heart
the
kiss
that
lacks
this
delicious
unction
is
meagre
and
formal
the
priest
had
felt
the
difference
he
could
fathom
the
depths
that
lie
between
the
motherhood
of
the
flesh
and
the
motherhood
of
the
heart
he
gave
the
marquise
a
keen
scrutinizing
glance
then
he
said
you
are
right
madame
it
would
be
better
for
you
if
you
were
dead
ah
she
cried
then
you
know
all
my
misery
i
see
you
do
if
christian
priest
as
you
are
you
can
guess
my
determination
to
die
and
sanction
it
yes
i
meant
to
die
but
i
have
lacked
the
courage
the
spirit
was
strong
but
the
flesh
was
weak
and
when
my
hand
did
not
tremble
the
spirit
within
me
wavered
i
do
not
know
the
reason
of
these
inner
struggles
and
alternations
i
am
very
pitiably
a
woman
no
doubt
weak
in
my
will
strong
only
to
love
oh
i
despise
myself
at
night
when
all
my
household
was
asleep
i
would
go
out
bravely
as
far
as
the
lake
but
when
i
stood
on
the
brink
my
cowardice
shrank
from
to
you
i
will
confess
my
weakness
when
i
lay
in
my
bed
again
shame
would
come
over
me
and
courage
would
come
back
once
i
took
a
dose
of
laudanum
i
was
ill
but
i
did
not
die
i
thought
i
had
emptied
the
phial
but
i
had
only
taken
half
the
you
are
lost
madame
the
cure
said
gravely
with
tears
in
his
voice
you
will
go
back
into
the
world
and
you
will
deceive
the
world
you
will
seek
and
find
a
compensation
as
you
imagine
it
to
be
for
your
woes
then
will
come
a
day
of
reckoning
for
your
pleasures
do
you
think
she
cried
that
shall
bestow
the
last
the
most
precious
treasures
of
my
heart
upon
the
first
base
impostor
who
can
play
the
comedy
of
passion
that
i
would
pollute
my
life
for
a
moment
of
doubtful
pleasure
no
the
flame
which
shall
consume
my
soul
shall
be
love
and
nothing
but
love
all
men
monsieur
have
the
senses
of
their
sex
but
not
all
have
the
man
s
soul
which
satisfies
all
the
requirements
of
our
nature
drawing
out
the
melodious
harmony
which
never
breaks
forth
save
in
response
to
the
pressure
of
feeling
such
a
soul
is
not
found
twice
in
our
lifetime
the
future
that
lies
before
me
is
hideous
i
know
it
a
woman
is
nothing
without
love
beauty
is
nothing
without
pleasure
and
even
if
happiness
were
offered
to
me
a
second
time
would
not
the
world
frown
upon
it
i
owe
my
daughter
an
honored
mother
oh
i
am
condemned
to
live
in
an
iron
circle
from
which
there
is
but
one
shameful
way
of
escape
the
round
of
family
duties
a
thankless
and
irksome
task
is
in
store
for
me
i
shall
curse
life
but
my
child
shall
have
at
least
a
fair
semblance
of
a
mother
i
will
give
her
treasures
of
virtue
for
the
treasures
of
love
of
which
i
defraud
her
i
have
not
even
the
mother
s
desire
to
live
to
enjoy
her
child
s
happiness
i
have
no
belief
in
happiness
what
will
helene
s
fate
be
my
own
beyond
doubt
how
can
a
mother
ensure
that
the
man
to
whom
she
gives
her
daughter
will
be
the
husband
of
her
heart
you
pour
scorn
on
the
miserable
creatures
who
sell
themselves
for
a
few
coins
to
any
though
want
and
hunger
absolve
the
brief
union
while
another
union
horrible
for
quite
other
reasons
is
tolerated
nay
encouraged
by
society
and
a
young
and
innocent
girl
is
married
to
a
man
whom
she
has
only
met
occasionally
during
the
previous
three
months
she
is
sold
for
her
whole
lifetime
it
is
true
that
the
price
is
high
if
you
allow
her
no
compensation
for
her
sorrows
you
might
at
least
respect
her
but
no
the
most
virtuous
of
women
can
not
escape
calumny
this
is
our
fate
in
its
double
aspect
open
prostitution
and
shame
secret
prostitution
and
unhappiness
as
for
the
poor
portionless
girls
they
may
die
or
go
mad
without
a
soul
to
pity
them
beauty
and
virtue
are
not
marketable
in
the
bazaar
where
souls
and
bodies
are
bought
and
sold
in
the
den
of
selfishness
which
you
call
society
why
not
disinherit
daughters
then
at
least
you
might
fulfil
one
of
the
laws
of
nature
and
guided
by
your
own
inclinations
choose
your
madame
from
your
talk
it
is
clear
to
me
that
neither
the
spirit
of
family
nor
the
sense
of
religion
appeals
to
you
why
should
you
hesitate
between
the
claims
of
the
social
selfishness
which
irritates
you
and
the
purely
personal
selfishness
which
craves
satisfactions
the
family
monsieur
does
such
a
thing
exist
i
decline
to
recognize
as
a
family
a
knot
of
individuals
bidden
by
society
to
divide
the
property
after
the
death
of
father
and
mother
and
to
go
their
separate
ways
a
family
means
a
temporary
association
of
persons
brought
together
by
no
will
of
their
own
dissolved
at
once
by
death
our
laws
have
broken
up
homes
and
estates
and
the
old
family
tradition
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
i
see
nothing
but
wreck
and
ruin
about
madame
you
will
only
return
to
god
when
his
hand
has
been
heavy
upon
you
and
i
pray
that
you
have
time
enough
given
to
you
in
which
to
make
your
peace
with
him
instead
of
looking
to
heaven
for
comfort
you
are
fixing
your
eyes
on
earth
philosophism
and
personal
interest
have
invaded
your
heart
like
the
children
of
the
sceptical
eighteenth
century
you
are
deaf
to
the
voice
of
religion
the
pleasures
of
this
life
bring
nothing
but
misery
you
are
about
to
make
an
exchange
of
sorrows
that
is
she
smiled
bitterly
i
will
falsify
your
predictions
she
said
i
shall
be
faithful
to
him
who
died
for
sorrow
he
answered
is
not
likely
to
live
long
save
in
souls
disciplined
by
religion
and
he
lowered
his
eyes
respectfully
lest
the
marquise
should
read
his
doubts
in
them
the
energy
of
her
outburst
had
grieved
him
he
had
seen
the
self
that
lurked
beneath
so
many
forms
and
despaired
of
softening
a
heart
which
affliction
seemed
to
sear
the
divine
sower
s
seed
could
not
take
root
in
such
a
soil
and
his
gentle
voice
was
drowned
by
the
clamorous
outcry
of
yet
the
good
man
returned
again
and
again
with
an
apostle
s
earnest
persistence
brought
back
by
a
hope
of
leading
so
noble
and
proud
a
soul
to
god
until
the
day
when
he
made
the
discovery
that
the
marquise
only
cared
to
talk
with
him
because
it
was
sweet
to
speak
of
him
who
was
no
more
he
would
not
lower
his
ministry
by
condoning
her
passion
and
confined
the
conversation
more
and
more
to
generalities
and
commonplaces
spring
came
and
with
the
spring
the
marquise
found
distraction
from
her
deep
melancholy
she
busied
herself
for
lack
of
other
occupation
with
her
estate
making
improvements
for
amusement
in
october
she
left
the
old
chateau
in
the
life
of
leisure
at
she
had
recovered
from
her
grief
and
grown
fair
and
fresh
her
grief
had
been
violent
at
first
in
its
course
as
the
quoit
hurled
forth
with
all
the
player
s
strength
and
like
the
quoit
after
many
oscillations
each
feebler
than
the
last
it
had
slackened
into
melancholy
melancholy
is
made
up
of
a
succession
of
such
oscillations
the
first
touching
upon
despair
the
last
on
the
border
between
pain
and
pleasure
in
youth
it
is
the
twilight
of
dawn
in
age
the
dusk
of
night
as
the
marquise
drove
through
the
village
in
her
traveling
carriage
she
met
the
cure
on
his
way
back
from
the
church
she
bowed
in
response
to
his
farewell
greeting
but
it
was
with
lowered
eyes
and
averted
face
she
did
not
wish
to
see
him
again
the
village
cure
had
judged
this
poor
diana
of
ephesus
only
too
well
iii
at
thirty
years
madame
firmiani
was
giving
a
ball
charles
de
vandenesse
a
young
man
of
great
promise
the
bearer
of
one
of
those
historic
names
which
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
legislation
are
always
associated
with
the
glory
of
france
had
received
letters
of
introduction
to
some
of
the
great
lady
s
friends
in
naples
and
had
come
to
thank
the
hostess
and
to
take
his
leave
vandenesse
had
already
acquitted
himself
creditably
on
several
diplomatic
missions
and
now
that
he
had
received
an
appointment
as
attache
to
a
plenipotentiary
at
the
congress
of
laybach
he
wished
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
make
some
study
of
italy
on
the
way
this
ball
was
a
sort
of
farewell
to
paris
and
its
amusements
and
its
rapid
whirl
of
life
to
the
great
eddying
intellectual
centre
and
maelstrom
of
pleasure
and
a
pleasant
thing
it
is
to
be
borne
along
by
the
current
of
this
sufficiently
slandered
great
city
of
paris
yet
charles
de
vandenesse
had
little
to
regret
accustomed
as
he
had
been
for
the
past
three
years
to
salute
european
capitals
and
turn
his
back
upon
them
at
the
capricious
bidding
of
a
diplomatist
s
destiny
women
no
longer
made
any
impression
upon
him
perhaps
he
thought
that
a
real
passion
would
play
too
large
a
part
in
a
diplomatist
s
life
or
perhaps
that
the
paltry
amusements
of
frivolity
were
too
empty
for
a
man
of
strong
character
we
all
of
us
have
huge
claims
to
strength
of
character
there
is
no
man
in
france
be
he
ever
so
ordinary
a
member
of
the
rank
and
file
of
humanity
that
will
waive
pretensions
to
something
beyond
mere
cleverness
charles
young
though
he
was
he
was
scarcely
turned
thirty
looked
at
life
with
a
philosophic
mind
concerning
himself
with
theories
and
means
and
ends
while
other
men
of
his
age
were
thinking
of
pleasure
sentiments
and
the
like
illusions
he
forced
back
into
some
inner
depth
the
generosity
and
enthusiasms
of
youth
and
by
nature
he
was
generous
he
tried
hard
to
be
cool
and
calculating
to
coin
the
fund
of
wealth
which
chanced
to
be
in
his
nature
into
gracious
manners
and
courtesy
and
attractive
arts
tis
the
proper
task
of
an
ambitious
man
to
play
a
sorry
part
to
gain
a
good
position
as
we
call
it
in
modern
days
he
had
been
dancing
and
now
he
gave
a
farewell
glance
over
the
rooms
to
carry
away
a
distinct
impression
of
the
ball
moved
doubtless
to
some
extent
by
the
feeling
which
prompts
a
to
stay
in
his
box
to
see
the
final
tableau
before
the
curtain
falls
but
de
vandenesse
had
another
reason
for
his
survey
he
gazed
curiously
at
the
scene
before
him
so
french
in
character
and
in
movement
seeking
to
carry
away
a
picture
of
the
light
and
laughter
and
the
faces
at
this
parisian
fete
to
compare
with
the
novel
faces
and
picturesque
surroundings
awaiting
him
at
naples
where
he
meant
to
spend
a
few
days
before
presenting
himself
at
his
post
he
seemed
to
be
drawing
the
comparison
now
between
this
france
so
variable
changing
even
as
you
study
her
with
the
manners
and
aspects
of
that
other
land
known
to
him
as
yet
only
by
contradictory
hearsay
tales
or
books
of
travel
for
the
most
part
unsatisfactory
thoughts
of
a
somewhat
poetical
cast
albeit
hackneyed
and
trite
to
our
modern
ideas
crossed
his
brain
in
response
to
some
longing
of
which
perhaps
he
himself
was
hardly
conscious
a
desire
in
the
depths
of
a
heart
fastidious
rather
than
jaded
vacant
rather
than
seared
these
are
the
wealthiest
and
most
fashionable
women
and
the
greatest
ladies
in
paris
he
said
to
himself
these
are
the
great
men
of
the
day
great
orators
and
men
of
letters
great
names
and
titles
artists
and
men
in
power
and
yet
in
it
all
it
seems
to
me
as
if
there
were
nothing
but
petty
intrigues
and
loves
meaningless
smiles
and
causeless
scorn
eyes
lighted
by
no
flame
within
in
abundance
running
aimlessly
to
waste
all
those
faces
are
here
not
so
much
for
enjoyment
as
to
escape
from
dulness
none
of
the
emotion
is
genuine
if
you
ask
for
nothing
but
court
feathers
properly
adjusted
fresh
gauzes
and
pretty
toilettes
and
fragile
fair
women
if
you
desire
simply
to
skim
the
surface
of
life
here
is
your
world
for
you
be
content
with
meaningless
phrases
and
fascinating
simpers
and
do
not
ask
for
real
feeling
for
my
own
part
i
abhor
the
stale
intrigues
which
end
in
and
places
and
marriages
or
if
love
comes
into
the
question
in
stealthy
compromises
so
ashamed
are
we
of
the
mere
semblance
of
passion
not
a
single
one
of
all
these
eloquent
faces
tells
you
of
a
soul
a
soul
wholly
absorbed
by
one
idea
as
by
remorse
regrets
and
misfortune
go
about
clad
in
jests
there
is
not
one
woman
here
whose
resistance
i
should
care
to
overcome
not
one
who
could
drag
you
down
to
the
pit
where
will
you
find
energy
in
paris
a
poniard
here
is
a
curious
toy
to
hang
from
a
gilt
nail
in
a
picturesque
sheath
to
match
the
women
the
brains
and
hearts
of
paris
are
all
on
a
par
there
is
no
passion
left
because
we
have
no
individuality
high
birth
and
intellect
and
fortune
are
all
reduced
to
one
level
we
all
have
taken
to
the
uniform
black
coat
by
way
of
mourning
for
a
dead
france
there
is
no
love
between
equals
between
two
lovers
there
should
be
differences
to
efface
wide
gulfs
to
fill
the
charm
of
love
fled
from
us
in
our
dulness
and
our
humdrum
lives
are
the
outcome
of
the
political
system
italy
at
any
rate
is
the
land
of
sharp
contrasts
woman
there
is
a
malevolent
animal
a
dangerous
unreasoning
siren
guided
only
by
her
tastes
and
appetites
a
creature
no
more
to
be
trusted
than
a
tiger
mme
firmiani
here
came
up
to
interrupt
this
soliloquy
made
up
of
vague
conflicting
and
fragmentary
thoughts
which
can
not
be
reproduced
in
words
the
whole
charm
of
such
musing
lies
in
its
vagueness
what
is
it
but
a
sort
of
mental
haze
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
some
one
who
has
the
greatest
wish
to
make
your
acquaintance
after
all
that
she
has
heard
of
you
said
the
lady
taking
his
arm
she
brought
him
into
the
next
room
and
with
such
a
smile
and
glance
as
a
parisienne
alone
can
give
she
indicated
a
woman
sitting
by
the
hearth
who
is
she
the
comte
de
vandenesse
asked
quickly
you
have
heard
her
name
more
than
once
coupled
with
praise
or
blame
she
is
a
woman
who
lives
in
seclusion
a
perfect
oh
if
ever
you
have
been
merciful
in
your
life
for
pity
s
sake
tell
me
her
she
is
the
marquise
d
i
will
take
lessons
from
her
she
had
managed
to
make
a
peer
of
france
of
that
eminently
ordinary
person
her
husband
and
a
dullard
into
a
power
in
the
land
but
pray
tell
me
this
did
lord
grenville
die
for
her
sake
do
you
think
as
some
women
say
possibly
since
that
adventure
real
or
imaginary
she
is
very
much
changed
poor
thing
she
has
not
gone
into
society
since
four
years
of
constancy
that
is
something
in
paris
if
she
is
here
here
mme
firmiani
broke
off
adding
with
a
mysterious
expression
i
am
forgetting
that
i
must
say
nothing
go
and
talk
with
for
a
moment
charles
stood
motionless
leaning
lightly
against
the
frame
of
the
doorway
wholly
absorbed
in
his
scrutiny
of
a
woman
who
had
become
famous
no
one
exactly
knew
how
or
why
such
curious
anomalies
are
frequent
enough
in
the
world
mme
d
aiglemont
s
reputation
was
certainly
no
more
extraordinary
than
plenty
of
other
great
reputations
there
are
men
who
are
always
in
travail
of
some
great
work
which
never
sees
the
light
statisticians
held
to
be
profound
on
the
score
of
calculations
which
they
take
very
good
care
not
to
publish
politicians
who
live
on
a
newspaper
article
men
of
letters
and
artists
whose
performances
are
never
given
to
the
world
men
of
science
much
as
sganarelle
is
a
latinist
for
those
who
know
no
latin
there
are
the
men
who
are
allowed
by
general
consent
to
possess
a
peculiar
capacity
for
some
one
thing
be
it
for
the
direction
of
arts
or
for
the
conduct
of
an
important
mission
the
admirable
phrase
a
man
with
a
special
subject
might
have
been
invented
on
purpose
for
these
acephalous
species
in
the
domain
of
literature
and
politics
charles
gazed
longer
than
he
intended
he
was
vexed
with
himself
for
feeling
so
strongly
interested
it
is
true
however
that
the
lady
s
appearance
was
a
refutation
of
the
young
man
s
ballroom
generalizations
the
marquise
had
reached
her
thirtieth
year
she
was
beautiful
in
spite
of
her
fragile
form
and
extremely
delicate
look
her
greatest
charm
lay
in
her
still
face
revealing
unfathomed
depths
of
soul
some
haunting
thought
veiled
as
it
were
the
full
brilliance
of
eyes
which
told
of
a
fevered
life
and
boundless
resignation
so
seldom
did
she
raise
the
eyelids
soberly
downcast
and
so
listless
were
her
glances
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
fire
in
her
eyes
were
reserved
for
some
occult
contemplation
any
man
of
genius
and
feeling
must
have
felt
strangely
attracted
by
her
gentleness
and
silence
if
the
mind
sought
to
explain
the
mysterious
problem
of
a
constant
inward
turning
from
the
present
to
the
past
the
soul
was
no
less
interested
in
initiating
itself
into
the
secrets
of
a
heart
proud
in
some
sort
of
its
anguish
everything
about
her
moreover
was
in
keeping
with
these
thoughts
which
she
inspired
like
almost
all
women
who
have
very
long
hair
she
was
very
pale
and
perfectly
white
the
marvelous
fineness
of
her
skin
that
almost
unerring
sign
indicated
a
quick
sensibility
which
could
be
seen
yet
more
unmistakably
in
her
features
there
was
the
same
minute
and
wonderful
delicacy
of
finish
in
them
that
the
chinese
artist
gives
to
his
fantastic
figures
perhaps
her
neck
was
rather
too
long
but
such
necks
belong
to
the
most
graceful
type
and
suggest
vague
affinities
between
a
woman
s
head
and
the
magnetic
curves
of
the
serpent
leave
not
a
single
one
of
the
thousand
signs
and
tokens
by
which
the
most
inscrutable
character
betrays
itself
to
an
observer
of
human
nature
he
has
but
to
watch
carefully
the
little
movements
of
a
woman
s
head
the
expressive
turns
and
curves
of
her
neck
and
throat
to
read
her
nature
mme
d
aiglemont
s
dress
harmonized
with
the
haunting
thought
that
informed
the
whole
woman
her
hair
was
gathered
up
into
a
tall
coronet
of
broad
plaits
without
ornament
of
any
kind
she
seemed
to
have
bidden
farewell
for
ever
to
elaborate
toilettes
nor
were
any
of
the
small
arts
of
coquetry
which
spoil
so
many
women
to
be
detected
in
her
perhaps
her
bodice
modest
though
it
was
did
not
altogether
conceal
the
dainty
grace
of
her
figure
perhaps
too
her
gown
looked
rich
from
the
extreme
distinction
of
its
fashion
and
if
it
is
permissible
to
look
for
expression
in
the
arrangement
of
stuffs
surely
those
numerous
straight
folds
invested
her
with
a
great
dignity
there
may
have
been
some
lingering
trace
of
the
indelible
feminine
foible
in
the
minute
care
bestowed
upon
her
hand
and
foot
yet
if
she
allowed
them
to
be
seen
with
some
pleasure
it
would
have
tasked
the
utmost
malice
of
a
rival
to
discover
any
affectation
in
her
gestures
so
natural
did
they
seem
so
much
a
part
of
old
childish
habit
that
her
careless
grace
absolved
this
vestige
of
vanity
all
these
little
characteristics
the
nameless
trifles
which
combine
to
make
up
the
sum
of
a
woman
s
prettiness
or
ugliness
her
charm
or
lack
of
charm
can
only
be
indicated
when
as
with
mme
d
aiglemont
a
personality
dominates
and
gives
coherence
to
the
details
informing
them
blending
them
all
in
an
exquisite
whole
her
manner
was
perfectly
in
accord
with
her
style
of
beauty
and
her
dress
only
to
certain
women
at
a
certain
age
is
it
given
to
put
language
into
their
attitude
is
it
joy
or
is
it
sorrow
that
teaches
a
woman
of
thirty
the
secret
of
that
eloquence
of
carriage
so
that
she
must
always
remain
an
enigma
which
each
interprets
by
the
aid
of
his
hopes
desires
or
theories
the
way
in
which
the
marquise
leaned
both
elbows
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
the
toying
of
her
interclasped
fingers
the
curve
of
her
throat
the
indolent
lines
of
her
languid
but
lissome
body
as
she
lay
back
in
graceful
exhaustion
as
it
were
her
indolent
limbs
her
unstudied
pose
the
utter
lassitude
of
her
movements
all
suggested
that
this
was
a
woman
for
whom
life
had
lost
its
interest
a
woman
who
had
known
the
joys
of
love
only
in
dreams
a
woman
bowed
down
by
the
burden
of
memories
of
the
past
a
woman
who
had
long
since
despaired
of
the
future
and
despaired
of
herself
an
unoccupied
woman
who
took
the
emptiness
of
her
own
life
for
the
nothingness
of
life
charles
de
vandenesse
saw
and
admired
the
beautiful
picture
before
him
as
a
kind
of
artistic
success
beyond
an
ordinary
woman
s
powers
of
attainment
he
was
acquainted
with
d
aiglemont
and
now
at
the
first
sight
of
d
aiglemont
s
wife
the
young
diplomatist
saw
at
a
glance
a
disproportionate
marriage
an
incompatibility
to
use
the
legal
jargon
so
great
that
it
was
impossible
that
the
marquise
should
love
her
husband
and
yet
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
s
life
was
above
reproach
and
for
any
observer
the
mystery
about
her
was
the
more
interesting
on
this
account
the
first
impulse
of
surprise
over
vandenesse
cast
about
for
the
best
way
of
approaching
mme
d
aiglemont
he
would
try
a
commonplace
piece
of
diplomacy
he
thought
he
would
disconcert
her
by
a
piece
of
clumsiness
and
see
how
she
would
receive
it
madame
he
said
seating
himself
near
her
through
a
fortunate
indiscretion
i
have
learned
that
for
some
reason
unknown
to
me
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
attract
your
notice
i
owe
you
the
more
thanks
because
i
have
never
been
so
honored
before
at
the
same
time
you
are
responsible
for
one
of
my
faults
for
i
mean
never
to
be
modest
again
you
will
make
a
mistake
monsieur
she
laughed
vanity
should
be
left
to
those
who
have
nothing
else
to
recommend
the
conversation
thus
opened
ranged
at
large
in
the
usual
way
over
a
multitude
of
topics
art
and
literature
politics
men
and
things
till
insensibly
they
fell
to
talking
of
the
eternal
theme
in
france
and
all
the
world
over
love
sentiment
and
women
we
are
you
are
this
was
the
gist
and
substance
of
all
the
more
or
less
ingenious
discourse
between
charles
and
the
marquise
as
of
all
such
discourses
past
present
and
to
come
allow
a
certain
space
of
time
and
the
two
formulas
shall
begin
to
mean
love
me
and
i
will
love
madame
charles
de
vandenesse
exclaimed
under
his
breath
you
have
made
me
bitterly
regret
that
i
am
leaving
paris
in
italy
i
certainly
shall
not
pass
hours
in
intellectual
enjoyment
such
as
this
has
perhaps
monsieur
you
will
find
happiness
and
happiness
is
worth
more
than
all
the
brilliant
things
true
and
false
that
are
said
every
evening
in
before
charles
took
leave
he
asked
permission
to
pay
a
farewell
call
on
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
and
very
lucky
did
he
feel
himself
when
the
form
of
words
in
which
he
expressed
himself
for
once
was
used
in
all
sincerity
and
that
night
and
all
day
long
on
the
morrow
he
could
not
put
the
thought
of
the
marquise
out
of
his
mind
at
times
he
wondered
why
she
had
singled
him
out
what
she
had
meant
when
she
asked
him
to
come
to
see
her
and
thought
supplied
an
inexhaustible
commentary
again
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
discovered
the
motives
of
her
curiosity
and
he
grew
intoxicated
with
hope
or
frigidly
sober
with
each
new
construction
put
upon
that
piece
of
commonplace
civility
sometimes
it
meant
everything
sometimes
nothing
he
made
up
his
mind
at
last
that
he
would
not
yield
to
this
inclination
and
went
to
call
on
mme
d
aiglemont
there
are
thoughts
which
determine
our
conduct
while
we
do
not
so
much
as
suspect
their
existence
if
at
first
sight
this
assertion
appears
to
be
less
a
truth
than
a
paradox
let
any
candid
inquirer
look
into
his
own
life
and
he
shall
find
abundant
confirmation
therein
charles
went
to
mme
d
aiglemont
and
so
obeyed
one
of
these
latent
germs
of
thought
of
which
our
experience
and
our
intellectual
gains
and
achievements
are
but
later
and
tangible
developments
for
a
young
man
a
woman
of
thirty
has
irresistible
attractions
there
is
nothing
more
natural
nothing
better
established
no
human
tie
of
stouter
tissue
than
the
attachment
between
such
a
woman
as
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
and
such
a
man
as
charles
de
vandenesse
you
can
see
examples
of
it
every
day
in
the
world
a
girl
as
a
matter
of
fact
has
too
many
young
illusions
she
is
too
inexperienced
the
instinct
of
sex
counts
for
too
much
in
her
love
for
a
young
man
to
feel
flattered
by
it
a
woman
of
thirty
knows
all
that
is
involved
in
the
to
be
made
among
the
impulses
of
the
first
put
curiosity
and
other
motives
than
love
the
second
acts
with
integrity
of
sentiment
the
first
yields
the
second
makes
deliberate
choice
is
not
that
choice
in
itself
an
immense
flattery
a
woman
armed
with
experience
forewarned
by
knowledge
almost
always
dearly
bought
seems
to
give
more
than
herself
while
the
inexperienced
and
credulous
girl
unable
to
draw
comparisons
for
lack
of
knowledge
can
appreciate
nothing
at
its
just
worth
she
accepts
love
and
ponders
it
a
woman
is
a
counselor
and
a
guide
at
an
age
when
we
love
to
be
guided
and
obedience
is
delight
while
a
girl
would
fain
learn
all
things
meeting
us
with
a
girl
s
instead
of
a
woman
s
tenderness
she
affords
a
single
triumph
with
a
woman
there
is
resistance
upon
resistance
to
overcome
she
has
but
joy
and
tears
a
woman
has
rapture
and
remorse
a
girl
can
not
play
the
part
of
a
mistress
unless
she
is
so
corrupt
that
we
turn
from
her
with
loathing
a
woman
has
a
thousand
ways
of
preserving
her
power
and
her
dignity
she
has
risked
so
much
for
love
that
she
must
bid
him
pass
through
his
myriad
transformations
while
her
too
submissive
rival
gives
a
sense
of
too
serene
security
which
palls
if
the
one
sacrifices
her
maidenly
pride
the
other
immolates
the
honor
of
a
whole
family
a
girl
s
coquetry
is
of
the
simplest
she
thinks
that
all
is
said
when
the
veil
is
laid
aside
a
woman
s
coquetry
is
endless
she
shrouds
herself
in
veil
after
veil
she
satisfies
every
demand
of
man
s
vanity
the
novice
responds
but
to
one
and
there
are
terrors
fears
and
hesitations
trouble
and
storm
in
the
love
of
a
woman
of
thirty
years
never
to
be
found
in
a
young
girl
s
love
at
thirty
years
a
woman
asks
her
lover
to
give
her
back
the
esteem
she
has
forfeited
for
his
sake
she
lives
only
for
him
her
thoughts
are
full
of
his
future
he
must
have
a
great
career
she
bids
him
make
it
glorious
she
can
obey
entreat
command
humble
herself
or
rise
in
pride
times
without
number
she
brings
comfort
when
a
young
girl
can
only
make
moan
and
with
all
the
advantages
of
her
position
the
woman
of
thirty
can
be
a
girl
again
for
she
can
play
all
parts
assume
a
girl
s
bashfulness
and
grow
the
fairer
even
for
a
mischance
between
these
two
feminine
types
lies
the
immeasurable
difference
which
separates
the
foreseen
from
the
unforeseen
strength
from
weakness
the
woman
of
thirty
satisfies
every
requirement
the
young
girl
must
satisfy
none
under
penalty
of
ceasing
to
be
a
young
girl
such
ideas
as
these
developing
in
a
young
man
s
mind
help
to
strengthen
the
strongest
of
all
passions
a
passion
in
which
all
spontaneous
and
natural
feeling
is
blended
with
the
artificial
sentiment
created
by
conventional
manners
the
most
important
and
decisive
step
in
a
woman
s
life
is
the
very
one
that
she
invariably
regards
as
the
most
insignificant
after
her
marriage
she
is
no
longer
her
own
mistress
she
is
the
queen
and
the
of
the
domestic
hearth
the
sanctity
of
womanhood
is
incompatible
with
social
liberty
and
social
claims
and
for
a
woman
emancipation
means
corruption
if
you
give
a
stranger
the
right
of
entry
into
the
sanctuary
of
home
do
you
not
put
yourself
at
his
mercy
how
then
if
she
herself
bids
him
enter
it
is
not
this
an
offence
or
to
speak
more
accurately
a
first
step
towards
an
offence
you
must
either
accept
this
theory
with
all
its
consequences
or
absolve
illicit
passion
french
society
hitherto
has
chosen
the
third
and
middle
course
of
looking
on
and
laughing
when
offences
come
apparently
upon
the
spartan
principle
of
condoning
the
theft
and
punishing
clumsiness
and
this
system
it
may
be
is
a
very
wise
one
tis
a
most
appalling
punishment
to
have
all
your
neighbors
pointing
the
finger
of
scorn
at
you
a
punishment
that
a
woman
feels
in
her
very
heart
women
are
tenacious
and
all
of
them
should
be
tenacious
of
respect
without
esteem
they
can
not
exist
esteem
is
the
first
demand
that
they
make
of
love
the
most
corrupt
among
them
feels
that
she
must
in
the
first
place
pledge
the
future
to
buy
absolution
for
the
past
and
strives
to
make
her
lover
understand
that
only
for
irresistible
bliss
can
she
barter
the
respect
which
the
world
henceforth
will
refuse
to
her
some
such
reflections
cross
the
mind
of
any
woman
who
for
the
first
time
and
alone
receives
a
visit
from
a
young
man
and
this
especially
when
like
charles
de
vandenesse
the
visitor
is
handsome
or
clever
and
similarly
there
are
not
many
young
men
who
would
fail
to
base
some
secret
wish
on
one
of
the
thousand
and
one
ideas
which
justify
the
instinct
that
attracts
them
to
a
beautiful
witty
and
unhappy
woman
like
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
mme
d
aiglemont
therefore
felt
troubled
when
de
vandenesse
was
announced
and
as
for
him
he
was
almost
confused
in
spite
of
the
assurance
which
is
like
a
matter
of
costume
for
a
diplomatist
but
not
for
long
the
marquise
took
refuge
at
once
in
the
friendliness
of
manner
which
women
use
as
a
defence
against
the
misinterpretations
of
fatuity
a
manner
which
admits
of
no
afterthought
while
it
paves
the
way
to
sentiment
to
make
use
of
a
figure
of
speech
tempering
the
transition
through
the
ordinary
forms
of
politeness
in
this
ambiguous
position
where
the
four
roads
leading
respectively
to
indifference
respect
wonder
and
passion
meet
a
woman
may
stay
as
long
as
she
pleases
but
only
at
thirty
years
does
she
understand
all
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
laughter
tenderness
and
jest
are
all
permitted
to
her
at
the
crossing
of
the
ways
she
has
acquired
the
tact
by
which
she
finds
all
the
responsive
chords
in
a
man
s
nature
and
skill
in
judging
the
sounds
which
she
draws
forth
her
silence
is
as
dangerous
as
her
speech
you
will
never
read
her
at
that
age
nor
discover
if
she
is
frank
or
false
nor
how
far
she
is
serious
in
her
admissions
or
merely
laughing
at
you
she
gives
you
the
right
to
engage
in
a
game
of
fence
with
her
and
suddenly
by
a
glance
a
gesture
of
proved
potency
she
closes
the
combat
and
turns
from
you
with
your
secret
in
her
keeping
free
to
offer
you
up
in
a
jest
free
to
interest
herself
in
you
safe
alike
in
her
weakness
and
your
strength
although
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
took
up
her
position
upon
this
neutral
ground
during
the
first
interview
she
knew
how
to
preserve
a
high
womanly
dignity
the
sorrows
of
which
she
never
spoke
seemed
to
hang
over
her
assumed
gaiety
like
a
light
cloud
obscuring
the
sun
when
vandenesse
went
out
after
a
conversation
which
he
had
enjoyed
more
than
he
had
thought
possible
he
carried
with
him
the
conviction
that
this
was
like
to
be
too
costly
a
conquest
for
his
aspirations
it
would
mean
sentiment
from
here
to
yonder
he
thought
and
correspondence
enough
to
wear
out
a
deputy
on
his
promotion
and
yet
if
i
really
cared
luckless
phrase
that
has
been
the
ruin
of
many
an
infatuated
mortal
in
france
the
way
to
love
lies
through
charles
went
back
to
mme
d
aiglemont
and
imagined
that
she
showed
symptoms
of
pleasure
in
his
conversion
and
then
instead
of
giving
himself
up
like
a
boy
to
the
joy
of
falling
in
love
he
tried
to
play
a
double
role
he
did
his
best
to
act
passion
and
to
keep
cool
enough
to
analyze
the
progress
of
this
flirtation
to
be
lover
and
diplomatist
at
once
but
youth
and
hot
blood
and
analysis
could
only
end
in
one
way
over
head
and
ears
in
love
for
natural
or
artificial
the
marquise
was
more
than
his
match
each
time
he
went
out
from
mme
d
aiglemont
he
strenuously
held
himself
to
his
distrust
and
submitted
the
progressive
situations
of
his
case
to
a
rigorous
scrutiny
fatal
to
his
own
emotions
she
gave
me
to
understand
that
she
has
been
very
unhappy
and
lonely
said
he
to
himself
after
the
third
visit
and
that
but
for
her
little
girl
she
would
have
longed
for
death
she
was
perfectly
resigned
now
as
i
am
neither
her
brother
nor
her
spiritual
director
why
should
she
confide
her
troubles
to
she
loves
two
days
later
he
came
away
apostrophizing
modern
manners
love
takes
on
the
hue
of
every
age
in
love
is
a
doctrinaire
instead
of
proving
love
by
deeds
as
in
times
past
we
have
taken
to
argument
and
rhetoric
and
debate
women
s
tactics
are
reduced
to
three
shifts
in
the
first
place
they
declare
that
we
can
not
love
as
they
love
coquetry
the
marquise
simply
threw
it
at
me
like
a
challenge
this
evening
next
they
grow
pathetic
to
appeal
to
our
natural
generosity
or
for
does
it
not
flatter
a
young
man
s
vanity
to
console
a
woman
for
a
great
calamity
and
lastly
they
have
a
craze
for
virginity
she
must
have
thought
that
i
thought
her
very
innocent
my
good
faith
is
like
to
become
an
excellent
but
a
day
came
when
every
suspicious
idea
was
exhausted
he
asked
himself
whether
the
marquise
was
not
sincere
whether
so
much
suffering
could
be
feigned
and
why
she
should
act
the
part
of
resignation
she
lived
in
complete
seclusion
she
drank
in
silence
of
a
cup
of
sorrow
scarcely
to
be
guessed
unless
from
the
accent
of
some
chance
exclamation
in
a
voice
always
well
under
control
from
that
moment
charles
felt
a
keen
interest
in
mme
d
aiglemont
and
yet
though
his
visits
had
come
to
be
a
recognized
thing
and
in
some
sort
a
necessity
to
them
both
and
though
the
hour
was
kept
free
by
tacit
agreement
vandenesse
still
thought
that
this
woman
with
whom
he
was
in
love
was
more
clever
than
sincere
decidedly
she
is
an
uncommonly
clever
woman
he
used
to
say
to
himself
as
he
went
away
when
he
came
into
the
room
there
was
the
marquise
in
her
favorite
attitude
melancholy
expressed
in
her
whole
form
she
made
no
movement
when
he
entered
only
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
full
at
him
but
the
glance
that
she
gave
him
was
like
a
smile
mme
d
aiglemont
s
manner
meant
confidence
and
sincere
friendship
but
of
love
there
was
no
trace
charles
sat
down
and
found
nothing
to
say
a
sensation
for
which
no
language
exists
troubled
him
what
is
the
matter
with
you
she
asked
in
a
softened
voice
nothing
yes
i
am
thinking
of
something
of
which
as
yet
you
have
not
thought
at
what
is
it
why
the
congress
is
well
she
said
and
ought
you
to
have
been
at
the
congress
a
direct
answer
would
have
been
the
most
eloquent
and
delicate
declaration
of
love
but
charles
did
not
make
it
before
the
candid
friendship
in
mme
d
aiglemont
s
face
all
the
calculations
of
vanity
the
hopes
of
love
and
the
diplomatist
s
doubts
died
away
she
did
not
suspect
or
she
seemed
not
to
suspect
his
love
for
her
and
charles
in
utter
confusion
turning
upon
himself
was
forced
to
admit
that
he
had
said
and
done
nothing
which
could
warrant
such
a
belief
on
her
part
for
de
vandenesse
that
evening
the
marquise
was
as
she
had
always
been
simple
and
friendly
sincere
in
her
sorrow
glad
to
have
a
friend
proud
to
find
a
nature
responsive
to
her
own
nothing
more
it
had
not
entered
her
mind
that
a
woman
could
yield
twice
she
had
known
love
love
lay
bleeding
still
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
but
she
did
not
imagine
that
bliss
could
bring
her
its
rapture
twice
for
she
believed
not
merely
in
the
intellect
but
in
the
soul
and
for
her
love
was
no
simple
attraction
it
drew
her
with
all
noble
attractions
in
a
moment
charles
became
a
young
man
again
enthralled
by
the
splendor
of
a
nature
so
lofty
he
wished
for
a
fuller
initiation
into
the
secret
history
of
a
life
blighted
rather
by
fate
than
by
her
own
fault
mme
d
aiglemont
heard
him
ask
the
cause
of
the
overwhelming
sorrow
which
had
blended
all
the
harmonies
of
sadness
with
her
beauty
she
gave
him
one
glance
but
that
searching
look
was
like
a
seal
set
upon
some
solemn
compact
ask
no
more
such
questions
of
me
she
said
four
years
ago
on
this
very
day
the
man
who
loved
me
for
whom
i
would
have
given
up
everything
even
my
own
died
and
died
to
save
my
name
that
love
was
still
young
and
pure
and
full
of
illusions
when
it
came
to
an
end
before
i
gave
way
to
passion
and
never
was
a
woman
so
urged
by
fate
i
had
been
drawn
into
the
mistake
that
ruins
many
a
girl
s
life
a
marriage
with
a
man
whose
agreeable
manners
concealed
his
emptiness
marriage
plucked
my
hopes
away
one
by
one
and
now
i
have
forfeited
happiness
through
marriage
as
well
as
the
happiness
styled
criminal
and
i
have
known
no
happiness
nothing
is
left
to
me
if
i
could
not
die
at
least
i
ought
to
be
faithful
to
my
no
tears
came
with
the
words
her
eyes
fell
and
there
was
a
slight
twisting
of
the
fingers
interclasped
according
to
her
wont
it
was
simply
said
but
in
her
voice
there
was
a
note
of
despair
deep
as
her
love
seemed
to
have
been
which
left
charles
without
a
hope
the
dreadful
story
of
a
life
told
in
three
sentences
with
that
twisting
of
the
fingers
for
all
comment
the
might
of
anguish
in
a
fragile
woman
the
dark
depths
masked
by
a
fair
face
the
tears
of
four
years
of
mourning
fascinated
vandenesse
he
sat
silent
and
diminished
in
the
presence
of
her
woman
s
greatness
and
nobleness
seeing
not
the
physical
beauty
so
exquisite
so
perfectly
complete
but
the
soul
so
great
in
its
power
to
feel
he
had
found
at
last
the
ideal
of
his
fantastic
imaginings
the
ideal
so
vigorously
invoked
by
all
who
look
on
life
as
the
raw
material
of
a
passion
for
which
many
a
one
seeks
ardently
and
dies
before
he
has
grasped
the
whole
of
the
treasure
with
those
words
of
hers
in
his
ears
in
the
presence
of
her
sublime
beauty
his
own
thoughts
seemed
poor
and
narrow
powerless
as
he
felt
himself
to
find
words
of
his
own
simple
enough
and
lofty
enough
to
scale
the
heights
of
this
exaltation
he
took
refuge
in
platitudes
as
to
the
destiny
of
women
madame
we
must
either
forget
our
pain
or
hollow
out
a
tomb
for
but
reason
always
cuts
a
poor
figure
beside
sentiment
the
one
being
essentially
restricted
like
everything
that
is
positive
while
the
other
is
infinite
to
set
to
work
to
reason
where
you
are
required
to
feel
is
the
mark
of
a
limited
nature
vandenesse
therefore
held
his
peace
sat
awhile
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
then
came
away
a
prey
to
novel
thoughts
which
exalted
woman
for
him
he
was
in
something
the
same
position
as
a
painter
who
has
taken
the
vulgar
studio
model
for
a
type
of
womanhood
and
suddenly
confronts
the
of
the
musee
that
noblest
and
least
appreciated
of
antique
statues
charles
de
vandenesse
was
deeply
in
love
he
loved
mme
d
aiglemont
with
the
loyalty
of
youth
with
the
fervor
that
communicates
such
ineffable
charm
to
a
first
passion
with
a
simplicity
of
heart
of
which
a
man
only
recovers
some
fragments
when
he
loves
again
at
a
later
day
delicious
first
passion
of
youth
almost
always
deliciously
savored
by
the
woman
who
calls
it
forth
for
at
the
golden
prime
of
thirty
from
the
poetic
summit
of
a
woman
s
life
she
can
look
out
over
the
whole
course
of
love
backwards
into
the
past
forwards
into
the
future
and
knowing
all
the
price
to
be
paid
for
love
enjoys
her
bliss
with
the
dread
of
losing
it
ever
present
with
her
her
soul
is
still
fair
with
her
waning
youth
and
passion
daily
gathers
strength
from
the
dismaying
prospect
of
the
coming
days
this
is
love
vandenesse
said
to
himself
this
time
as
he
left
the
marquise
and
for
my
misfortune
i
love
a
woman
wedded
to
her
memories
it
is
hard
work
to
struggle
against
a
dead
rival
never
present
to
make
blunders
and
fall
out
of
favor
nothing
of
him
left
but
his
better
qualities
what
is
it
but
a
sort
of
high
treason
against
the
ideal
to
attempt
to
break
the
charm
of
memory
to
destroy
the
hopes
that
survive
a
lost
lover
precisely
because
he
only
awakened
longings
and
all
that
is
loveliest
and
most
enchanting
in
love
these
sober
reflections
due
to
the
discouragement
and
dread
of
failure
with
which
love
begins
in
earnest
were
the
last
expiring
effort
of
diplomatic
reasoning
thenceforward
he
knew
no
afterthoughts
he
was
the
plaything
of
his
love
and
lost
himself
in
the
nothings
of
that
strange
inexplicable
happiness
which
is
full
fed
by
a
chance
word
by
silence
or
a
vague
hope
he
tried
to
love
platonically
came
daily
to
breathe
the
air
that
she
breathed
became
almost
a
part
of
her
house
and
went
everywhere
with
her
slave
as
he
was
of
a
tyrannous
passion
compounded
of
egoism
and
devotion
of
the
completest
love
has
its
own
instinct
finding
the
way
to
the
heart
as
the
feeblest
insect
finds
the
way
to
its
flower
with
a
will
which
nothing
can
dismay
or
turn
aside
if
feeling
is
sincere
its
destiny
is
not
doubtful
let
a
woman
begin
to
think
that
her
life
depends
on
the
sincerity
or
fervor
or
earnestness
which
her
lover
shall
put
into
his
longings
and
is
there
not
sufficient
in
the
thought
to
put
her
through
all
the
tortures
of
dread
it
is
impossible
for
a
woman
be
she
wife
or
mother
to
be
secure
from
a
young
man
s
love
one
thing
it
is
within
her
power
to
do
to
refuse
to
see
him
as
soon
as
she
learns
a
secret
which
she
never
fails
to
guess
but
this
is
too
decided
a
step
to
take
at
an
age
when
marriage
has
become
a
prosaic
and
tiresome
yoke
and
conjugal
affection
is
something
less
than
tepid
if
indeed
her
husband
has
not
already
begun
to
neglect
her
is
a
woman
plain
she
is
flattered
by
a
love
which
gives
her
fairness
is
she
young
and
charming
she
is
only
to
be
won
by
a
fascination
as
great
as
her
own
power
to
charm
that
is
to
say
a
fascination
irresistible
is
she
virtuous
there
is
a
love
sublime
in
its
earthliness
which
leads
her
to
find
something
like
absolution
in
the
very
greatness
of
the
surrender
and
glory
in
a
hard
struggle
everything
is
a
snare
no
lesson
therefore
is
too
severe
where
the
temptation
is
so
strong
the
seclusion
in
which
the
greeks
and
orientals
kept
and
keep
their
women
an
example
more
and
more
followed
in
modern
england
is
the
only
safeguard
of
domestic
morality
but
under
this
system
there
is
an
end
of
all
the
charm
of
social
intercourse
and
society
and
good
breeding
and
refinement
of
manners
become
impossible
the
nations
must
take
their
choice
so
a
few
months
went
by
and
mme
d
aiglemont
discovered
that
her
life
was
closely
bound
with
this
young
man
s
life
without
overmuch
confusion
in
her
surprise
and
felt
with
something
almost
like
pleasure
that
she
shared
his
tastes
and
his
thoughts
had
she
adopted
vandenesse
s
ideas
or
was
it
vandenesse
who
had
made
her
lightest
whims
his
own
she
was
not
careful
to
inquire
she
had
been
swept
out
already
into
the
current
of
passion
and
yet
this
adorable
woman
told
herself
with
the
confident
reiteration
of
misgiving
ah
no
i
will
be
faithful
to
him
who
died
for
pascal
said
that
the
doubt
of
god
implies
belief
in
and
similarly
it
may
be
said
that
a
woman
only
parleys
when
she
has
surrendered
a
day
came
when
the
marquise
admitted
to
herself
that
she
was
loved
and
with
that
admission
came
a
time
of
wavering
among
countless
conflicting
thoughts
and
feelings
the
superstitions
of
experience
spoke
their
language
should
she
be
happy
was
it
possible
that
she
should
find
happiness
outside
the
limits
of
the
laws
which
society
rightly
or
wrongly
has
set
up
for
humanity
to
live
by
hitherto
her
cup
of
life
had
been
full
of
bitterness
was
there
any
happy
issue
possible
for
the
ties
which
united
two
human
beings
held
apart
by
social
conventions
and
might
not
happiness
be
bought
too
dear
still
this
so
ardently
desired
happiness
for
which
it
is
so
natural
to
seek
might
perhaps
be
found
after
all
curiosity
is
always
retained
on
the
lover
s
side
in
the
suit
the
secret
tribunal
was
still
sitting
when
vandenesse
appeared
and
his
presence
put
the
metaphysical
spectre
reason
to
flight
if
such
are
the
successive
transformations
through
which
a
sentiment
transient
though
it
be
passes
in
a
young
man
and
a
woman
of
thirty
there
comes
a
moment
of
time
when
the
shades
of
difference
blend
into
each
other
when
all
reasonings
end
in
a
single
and
final
reflection
which
is
lost
and
absorbed
in
the
desire
which
it
confirms
then
the
longer
the
resistance
the
mightier
the
voice
of
love
and
here
endeth
this
lesson
or
rather
this
study
made
from
the
to
borrow
a
most
graphic
term
from
the
studio
for
in
this
history
it
is
not
so
much
intended
to
portray
love
as
to
lay
bare
its
mechanism
and
its
dangers
from
this
moment
every
day
adds
color
to
these
dry
bones
clothes
them
again
with
living
flesh
and
blood
and
the
charm
of
youth
and
puts
vitality
into
their
movements
till
they
glow
once
more
with
the
beauty
the
persuasive
grace
of
sentiment
the
loveliness
of
life
charles
found
mme
d
aiglemont
absorbed
in
thought
and
to
his
what
is
it
spoken
in
thrilling
tones
grown
persuasive
with
the
heart
s
soft
magic
she
was
careful
not
to
reply
the
delicious
question
bore
witness
to
the
perfect
unity
of
their
spirits
and
the
marquise
felt
with
a
woman
s
wonderful
intuition
that
to
give
any
expression
to
the
sorrow
in
her
heart
would
be
to
make
an
advance
if
even
now
each
one
of
those
words
was
fraught
with
significance
for
them
both
in
what
fathomless
depths
might
she
not
plunge
at
the
first
step
she
read
herself
with
a
clear
and
lucid
glance
she
was
silent
and
vandenesse
followed
her
example
i
am
not
feeling
well
she
said
at
last
taking
alarm
at
the
pause
fraught
with
such
great
moment
for
them
both
when
the
language
of
the
eyes
completely
filled
the
blank
left
by
the
helplessness
of
speech
madame
said
charles
and
his
voice
was
tender
but
unsteady
with
strong
feeling
soul
and
body
are
both
dependent
on
each
other
if
you
were
happy
you
would
be
young
and
fresh
why
do
you
refuse
to
ask
of
love
all
that
love
has
taken
from
you
you
think
that
your
life
is
over
when
it
is
only
just
beginning
trust
yourself
to
a
friend
s
care
it
is
so
sweet
to
be
i
am
old
already
she
said
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
continue
to
suffer
as
in
the
past
and
one
must
love
do
you
say
well
i
must
not
and
i
can
not
your
friendship
has
put
some
sweetness
into
my
life
but
beside
you
i
care
for
no
one
no
one
could
efface
my
memories
a
friend
i
accept
i
should
fly
from
a
lover
besides
would
it
be
a
very
generous
thing
to
do
to
exchange
a
withered
heart
for
a
young
heart
to
smile
upon
illusions
which
now
i
can
not
share
to
cause
happiness
in
which
i
should
either
have
no
belief
or
tremble
to
lose
i
should
perhaps
respond
to
his
devotion
with
egoism
should
weigh
and
deliberate
while
he
felt
my
memory
would
resent
the
poignancy
of
his
happiness
no
if
you
love
once
that
love
is
never
replaced
you
see
indeed
who
would
have
my
heart
at
this
price
there
was
a
tinge
of
heartless
coquetry
in
the
words
the
last
effort
of
discretion
if
he
loses
courage
well
and
good
i
shall
live
alone
and
the
thought
came
from
the
very
depths
of
the
woman
for
her
it
was
the
too
slender
willow
twig
caught
in
vain
by
a
swimmer
swept
out
by
the
current
vandenesse
s
involuntary
shudder
at
her
dictum
plead
more
eloquently
for
him
than
all
his
past
assiduity
nothing
moves
a
woman
so
much
as
the
discovery
of
a
gracious
delicacy
in
us
such
a
refinement
of
sentiment
as
her
own
for
a
woman
the
grace
and
delicacy
are
sure
tokens
of
truth
charles
start
revealed
the
sincerity
of
his
love
mme
d
aiglemont
learned
the
strength
of
his
affection
from
the
intensity
of
his
pain
perhaps
you
are
right
he
said
coldly
new
love
new
vexation
of
then
he
changed
the
subject
and
spoke
of
indifferent
matters
but
he
was
visibly
moved
and
he
concentrated
his
gaze
on
mme
d
aiglemont
as
if
he
were
seeing
her
for
the
last
time
adieu
madame
he
said
with
emotion
in
his
voice
said
she
with
that
subtle
coquetry
the
secret
of
a
very
few
among
women
he
made
no
answer
and
went
when
charles
was
no
longer
there
when
his
empty
chair
spoke
for
him
regrets
flocked
in
upon
her
and
she
found
fault
with
herself
passion
makes
an
immense
advance
as
soon
as
a
woman
persuades
herself
that
she
has
failed
somewhat
in
generosity
or
hurt
a
noble
nature
in
love
there
is
never
any
need
to
be
on
our
guard
against
the
worst
in
us
that
is
a
safeguard
a
woman
only
surrenders
at
the
summons
of
a
virtue
the
floor
of
hell
is
paved
with
good
intentions
it
is
no
preacher
s
paradox
vandenesse
stopped
away
for
several
days
every
evening
at
the
accustomed
hour
the
marquise
sat
expectant
in
remorseful
impatience
she
could
not
write
that
would
be
a
declaration
and
moreover
her
instinct
told
her
that
he
would
come
back
on
the
sixth
day
he
was
announced
and
never
had
she
heard
the
name
with
such
delight
her
joy
frightened
her
you
have
punished
me
well
she
said
addressing
him
vandenesse
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
punished
he
echoed
and
for
what
he
understood
her
quite
well
but
he
meant
to
be
avenged
for
all
that
he
had
suffered
as
soon
as
she
suspected
it
why
have
you
not
come
to
see
me
she
demanded
with
a
smile
then
you
have
seen
no
visitors
asked
he
parrying
the
question
yes
de
ronquerolles
and
de
marsay
and
young
d
escrignon
came
and
stayed
for
nearly
two
hours
the
first
two
yesterday
the
last
this
morning
and
besides
i
have
had
a
call
i
believe
from
mme
firmiani
and
from
your
sister
mme
de
here
was
a
new
infliction
torture
which
none
can
comprehend
unless
they
know
love
as
a
fierce
and
tyrant
whose
mildest
symptom
is
a
monstrous
jealousy
a
perpetual
desire
to
snatch
away
the
beloved
from
every
other
influence
what
thought
he
to
himself
she
has
seen
visitors
she
has
been
with
happy
creatures
and
talking
to
them
while
i
was
unhappy
and
all
he
buried
his
annoyance
forthwith
and
consigned
love
to
the
depths
of
his
heart
like
a
coffin
to
the
sea
his
thoughts
were
of
the
kind
that
never
find
expression
in
words
they
pass
through
the
mind
swiftly
as
a
deadly
acid
that
poisons
as
it
evaporates
and
vanishes
his
brow
however
was
and
mme
d
aiglemont
guided
by
her
woman
s
instinct
shared
his
sadness
without
understanding
it
she
had
hurt
him
unwittingly
as
vandenesse
knew
he
talked
over
his
position
with
her
as
if
his
jealousy
were
one
of
those
hypothetical
cases
which
lovers
love
to
discuss
then
the
marquise
understood
it
all
she
was
so
deeply
moved
that
she
could
not
keep
back
the
tears
and
so
these
lovers
entered
the
heaven
of
love
heaven
and
hell
are
two
great
imaginative
conceptions
formulating
our
ideas
of
joy
and
sorrow
those
two
poles
about
which
human
existence
revolves
is
not
heaven
a
figure
of
speech
covering
now
and
for
evermore
an
infinite
of
human
feeling
impossible
to
express
save
in
its
accidents
since
that
joy
is
one
and
what
is
hell
but
the
symbol
of
our
infinite
power
to
suffer
tortures
so
diverse
that
of
our
pain
it
is
possible
to
fashion
works
of
art
for
no
two
human
sorrows
are
alike
one
evening
the
two
lovers
sat
alone
and
side
by
side
silently
watching
one
of
the
fairest
transformations
of
the
sky
a
cloudless
heaven
taking
hues
of
pale
gold
and
purple
from
the
last
rays
of
the
sunset
with
the
slow
fading
of
the
daylight
sweet
thoughts
seem
to
awaken
and
soft
stirrings
of
passion
and
a
mysterious
sense
of
trouble
in
the
midst
of
calm
nature
sets
before
us
vague
images
of
bliss
bidding
us
enjoy
the
happiness
within
our
reach
or
lament
it
when
it
has
fled
in
those
moments
fraught
with
enchantment
when
the
tender
light
in
the
canopy
of
the
sky
blends
in
harmony
with
the
spells
working
within
it
is
difficult
to
resist
the
heart
s
desires
grown
so
magically
potent
cares
are
blunted
joy
becomes
ecstasy
pain
intolerable
anguish
the
pomp
of
sunset
gives
the
signal
for
confessions
and
draws
them
forth
silence
grows
more
dangerous
than
speech
for
it
gives
to
eyes
all
the
power
of
the
infinite
of
the
heavens
reflected
in
them
and
for
speech
the
least
word
has
irresistible
might
is
not
the
light
infused
into
the
voice
and
purple
into
the
glances
is
not
heaven
within
us
or
do
we
feel
that
we
are
in
the
heavens
vandenesse
and
julie
for
so
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
called
for
the
past
few
days
by
him
whom
she
loved
to
speak
of
as
charles
vandenesse
and
julie
were
talking
together
but
they
had
drifted
very
far
from
their
original
subject
and
if
their
spoken
words
had
grown
meaningless
they
listened
in
delight
to
the
unspoken
thoughts
that
lurked
in
the
sounds
her
hand
lay
in
his
she
had
abandoned
it
to
him
without
a
thought
that
she
had
granted
a
proof
of
love
together
they
leaned
forward
to
look
out
upon
a
majestic
cloud
country
full
of
snows
and
glaciers
and
fantastic
mountain
peaks
with
gray
stains
of
shadow
on
their
sides
a
picture
composed
of
sharp
contrasts
between
fiery
red
and
the
shadows
of
darkness
filling
the
skies
with
a
fleeting
vision
of
glory
which
can
not
be
reproduced
magnificent
of
sunrise
bright
shrouds
of
the
dying
sun
as
they
leaned
julie
s
hair
brushed
lightly
against
vandenesse
s
cheek
she
felt
that
light
contact
and
shuddered
violently
and
he
even
more
for
imperceptibly
they
both
had
reached
one
of
those
inexplicable
crises
when
quiet
has
wrought
upon
the
senses
until
every
faculty
of
perception
is
so
keen
that
the
slightest
shock
fills
the
heart
lost
in
melancholy
with
sadness
that
overflows
in
tears
or
raises
joy
to
ecstasy
in
a
heart
that
is
lost
in
the
vertigo
of
love
almost
involuntarily
julie
pressed
her
lover
s
hand
that
wooing
pressure
gave
courage
to
his
timidity
all
the
joy
of
the
present
all
the
hopes
of
the
future
were
blended
in
the
emotion
of
a
first
caress
the
bashful
trembling
kiss
that
mme
d
aiglemont
received
upon
her
cheek
the
slighter
the
concession
the
more
dangerous
and
insinuating
it
was
for
their
double
misfortune
it
was
only
too
sincere
a
revelation
two
noble
natures
had
met
and
blended
drawn
each
to
each
by
every
law
of
natural
attraction
held
apart
by
every
ordinance
general
d
aiglemont
came
in
at
that
very
moment
the
ministry
has
gone
out
he
said
your
uncle
will
be
in
the
new
cabinet
so
you
stand
an
uncommonly
good
chance
of
an
embassy
charles
and
julie
looked
at
each
other
and
flushed
red
that
blush
was
one
more
tie
to
unite
them
there
was
one
thought
and
one
remorse
in
either
mind
between
two
lovers
guilty
of
a
kiss
there
is
a
bond
quite
as
strong
and
terrible
as
the
bond
between
two
robbers
who
have
murdered
a
man
something
had
to
be
said
by
way
of
reply
i
do
not
care
to
leave
paris
now
charles
said
we
know
why
said
the
general
with
the
knowing
air
of
a
man
who
discovers
a
secret
you
do
not
like
to
leave
your
uncle
because
you
do
not
wish
to
lose
your
chance
of
succeeding
to
the
the
marquise
took
refuge
in
her
room
and
in
her
mind
passed
a
pitiless
verdict
upon
her
husband
his
stupidity
is
really
beyond
anything
iv
the
finger
of
god
between
the
barriere
d
italie
and
the
barriere
de
la
sante
along
the
boulevard
which
leads
to
the
jardin
des
plantes
you
have
a
view
of
paris
fit
to
send
an
artist
or
the
tourist
the
most
in
matters
of
landscape
into
ecstasies
reach
the
slightly
higher
ground
where
the
line
of
boulevard
shaded
by
tall
trees
curves
with
the
grace
of
some
green
and
silent
forest
avenue
and
you
see
spread
out
at
your
feet
a
deep
valley
populous
with
factories
looking
almost
countrified
among
green
trees
and
the
brown
streams
of
the
bievre
or
the
gobelins
on
the
opposite
slope
beneath
some
thousands
of
roofs
packed
close
together
like
heads
in
a
crowd
lurks
the
squalor
of
the
faubourg
the
imposing
cupola
of
the
pantheon
and
the
grim
melancholy
dome
of
the
tower
proudly
up
above
a
whole
town
in
itself
built
every
tier
being
grotesquely
represented
by
a
crooked
line
of
street
so
that
the
two
public
monuments
look
like
a
huge
pair
of
giants
dwarfing
into
insignificance
the
poor
little
houses
and
the
tallest
poplars
in
the
valley
to
your
left
behold
the
observatory
the
daylight
pouring
athwart
its
windows
and
galleries
producing
such
fantastical
strange
effects
that
the
building
looks
like
a
black
spectral
skeleton
further
yet
in
the
distance
rises
the
elegant
lantern
tower
of
the
invalides
soaring
up
between
the
bluish
pile
of
the
luxembourg
and
the
gray
tours
of
from
this
standpoint
the
lines
of
the
architecture
are
blended
with
green
leaves
and
gray
shadows
and
change
every
moment
with
every
aspect
of
the
heavens
every
alteration
of
light
or
color
in
the
sky
afar
the
skyey
spaces
themselves
seem
to
be
full
of
buildings
near
wind
the
serpentine
curves
of
waving
trees
and
green
footpaths
away
to
your
right
through
a
great
gap
in
this
singular
landscape
you
see
the
canal
a
long
pale
stripe
with
its
edging
of
reddish
stone
quays
and
fringes
of
lime
avenue
the
long
rows
of
buildings
beside
it
in
genuine
roman
style
are
the
public
granaries
beyond
again
on
the
very
last
plane
of
all
see
the
slopes
of
belleville
covered
with
houses
and
windmills
which
blend
their
freaks
of
outline
with
the
chance
effects
of
cloud
and
still
between
that
horizon
vague
as
some
childish
recollection
and
the
serried
range
of
roofs
in
the
valley
a
whole
city
lies
out
of
sight
a
huge
city
engulfed
as
it
were
in
a
vast
hollow
between
the
pinnacles
of
the
hopital
de
la
pitie
and
the
ridge
line
of
the
cimetiere
de
l
est
between
suffering
on
the
one
hand
and
death
on
the
other
a
city
sending
up
a
smothered
roar
like
ocean
grumbling
at
the
foot
of
a
cliff
as
if
to
let
you
know
that
i
am
here
when
the
sunlight
pours
like
a
flood
over
this
strip
of
paris
purifying
and
etherealizing
the
outlines
kindling
answering
lights
here
and
there
in
the
window
panes
brightening
the
red
tiles
flaming
about
the
golden
crosses
whitening
walls
and
transforming
the
atmosphere
into
a
gauzy
veil
calling
up
rich
contrasts
of
light
and
fantastic
shadow
when
the
sky
is
blue
and
earth
quivers
in
the
heat
and
the
bells
are
pealing
then
you
shall
see
one
of
the
eloquent
fairy
scenes
which
stamp
themselves
for
ever
on
the
imagination
a
scene
that
shall
find
as
fanatical
worshipers
as
the
wondrous
views
of
naples
and
byzantium
or
the
isles
of
florida
nothing
is
wanting
to
complete
the
harmony
the
murmur
of
the
world
of
men
and
the
idyllic
quiet
of
solitude
the
voices
of
a
million
human
creatures
and
the
voice
of
god
there
lies
a
whole
capital
beneath
the
peaceful
cypresses
of
the
landscape
lay
in
all
its
beauty
sparkling
in
the
spring
sunlight
as
i
stood
looking
out
over
it
one
morning
my
back
against
a
huge
that
flung
its
yellow
flowers
to
the
wind
at
the
sight
of
the
rich
and
glorious
view
before
me
i
thought
bitterly
of
the
scorn
with
which
even
in
our
literature
we
affect
to
hold
this
land
of
ours
and
poured
maledictions
on
the
pitiable
plutocrats
who
fall
out
of
love
with
fair
france
and
spend
their
gold
to
acquire
the
right
of
sneering
at
their
own
country
by
going
through
italy
at
a
gallop
and
inspecting
that
desecrated
land
through
an
i
cast
loving
eyes
on
modern
paris
i
was
beginning
to
dream
dreams
when
the
sound
of
a
kiss
disturbed
the
solitude
and
put
philosophy
to
flight
down
the
sidewalk
along
the
steep
bank
above
the
rippling
water
i
saw
beyond
the
ponte
des
gobelins
the
figure
of
a
woman
dressed
with
the
daintiest
simplicity
she
was
still
young
as
it
seemed
to
me
and
the
blithe
gladness
of
the
landscape
was
reflected
in
her
sweet
face
her
companion
a
handsome
young
man
had
just
set
down
a
little
boy
a
prettier
child
has
never
been
seen
and
to
this
day
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
the
little
one
or
his
mother
who
received
the
kiss
in
their
young
faces
in
their
eyes
their
smile
their
every
movement
you
could
read
the
same
deep
and
tender
thought
their
arms
were
interlaced
with
such
glad
swiftness
they
drew
close
together
with
such
marvelous
unanimity
of
impulse
that
conscious
of
nothing
but
themselves
they
did
not
so
much
as
see
me
a
second
child
however
a
little
girl
who
had
turned
her
back
upon
them
in
sullen
discontent
threw
me
a
glance
and
the
expression
in
her
eyes
startled
me
she
was
as
pretty
and
engaging
as
the
little
brother
whom
she
left
to
run
about
by
himself
sometimes
before
sometimes
after
their
mother
and
her
companion
but
her
charm
was
less
childish
and
now
as
she
stood
mute
and
motionless
her
attitude
and
demeanor
suggested
a
torpid
snake
there
was
something
indescribably
mechanical
in
the
way
in
which
the
pretty
woman
and
her
companion
paced
up
and
down
in
absence
of
mind
probably
they
were
content
to
walk
to
and
fro
between
the
little
bridge
and
a
carriage
that
stood
waiting
nearby
at
a
corner
in
the
boulevard
turning
stopping
short
now
and
again
looking
into
each
other
s
eyes
or
breaking
into
laughter
as
their
casual
talk
grew
lively
or
languid
grave
or
gay
i
watched
this
delicious
picture
a
while
from
my
by
the
great
and
should
have
turned
away
no
doubt
and
respected
their
privacy
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
chance
discovery
in
the
face
of
the
brooding
silent
elder
child
i
saw
traces
of
thought
overdeep
for
her
age
when
her
mother
and
the
young
man
at
her
side
turned
and
came
near
her
head
was
frequently
lowered
the
furtive
sidelong
glances
of
intelligence
that
she
gave
the
pair
and
the
child
her
brother
were
nothing
less
than
extraordinary
sometimes
the
pretty
woman
or
her
friend
would
stroke
the
little
boy
s
fair
curls
or
lay
a
caressing
finger
against
the
baby
throat
or
the
white
collar
as
he
played
at
keeping
step
with
them
and
no
words
can
describe
the
shrewd
subtlety
the
ingenuous
malice
the
fierce
intensity
which
lighted
up
that
pallid
little
face
with
the
faint
circles
already
round
the
eyes
truly
there
was
a
man
s
power
of
passion
in
the
delicate
little
girl
here
were
traces
of
suffering
or
of
thought
in
her
and
which
is
the
more
certain
token
of
death
when
life
is
in
blossom
physical
suffering
or
the
malady
of
too
early
thought
preying
upon
a
soul
as
yet
in
bud
perhaps
a
mother
knows
for
my
own
part
i
know
of
nothing
more
dreadful
to
see
than
an
old
man
s
thoughts
on
a
child
s
forehead
even
blasphemy
from
girlish
lips
is
less
monstrous
the
almost
stupid
stolidity
of
this
child
who
had
begun
to
think
already
her
rare
gestures
everything
about
her
interested
me
i
scrutinized
her
curiously
then
the
common
whim
of
the
observer
drew
me
to
compare
her
with
her
brother
and
to
note
their
likeness
and
unlikeness
her
brown
hair
and
dark
eyes
and
look
of
precocious
power
made
a
rich
contrast
with
the
little
one
s
fair
curled
head
and
eyes
and
winning
helplessness
she
perhaps
was
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
the
boy
was
full
four
years
younger
both
children
were
dressed
alike
but
here
again
looking
closely
i
noticed
a
difference
it
was
very
slight
a
little
thing
enough
but
in
the
light
of
after
events
i
saw
that
it
meant
a
whole
romance
in
the
past
a
whole
tragedy
to
come
the
little
maid
wore
a
linen
collar
with
a
plain
hem
her
brother
s
was
edged
with
dainty
embroidery
that
was
all
but
therein
lay
the
confession
of
a
heart
s
secret
a
tacit
preference
which
a
child
can
read
in
the
mother
s
inmost
soul
as
clearly
as
if
the
spirit
of
god
revealed
it
the
child
careless
and
glad
looked
almost
like
a
girl
his
skin
was
so
fair
and
fresh
his
movements
so
graceful
his
look
so
sweet
while
his
older
sister
in
spite
of
her
energy
in
spite
of
the
beauty
of
her
features
and
her
dazzling
complexion
looked
like
a
sickly
little
boy
in
her
bright
eyes
there
was
none
of
the
humid
softness
which
lends
such
charm
to
children
s
faces
they
seemed
like
courtiers
eyes
to
be
dried
by
some
inner
fire
and
in
her
pallor
there
was
a
certain
swarthy
olive
tint
the
sign
of
vigorous
character
twice
her
little
brother
came
to
her
holding
out
a
tiny
with
a
touching
charm
a
winning
look
and
wistful
expression
which
would
have
sent
charlet
into
ecstasies
but
she
only
scowled
in
answer
to
his
here
helene
will
you
take
it
so
persuasively
spoken
the
little
girl
so
sombre
and
vehement
beneath
her
apparent
indifference
shuddered
and
even
flushed
red
when
her
brother
came
near
her
but
the
little
one
seemed
not
to
notice
his
sister
s
dark
mood
and
his
unconsciousness
blended
with
earnestness
marked
a
final
difference
in
character
between
the
child
and
the
little
girl
whose
brow
was
overclouded
already
by
the
gloom
of
a
man
s
knowledge
and
cares
mamma
helene
will
not
play
cried
the
little
one
seizing
an
opportunity
to
complain
while
the
two
stood
silent
on
the
ponte
des
gobelins
let
her
alone
charles
you
know
very
well
that
she
is
always
tears
sprang
to
helene
s
eyes
at
the
words
so
thoughtlessly
uttered
by
her
mother
as
she
turned
abruptly
to
the
young
man
by
her
side
the
child
devoured
the
speech
in
silence
but
she
gave
her
brother
one
of
those
sagacious
looks
that
seemed
inexplicable
to
me
glancing
with
a
sinister
expression
from
the
bank
where
he
stood
to
the
bievre
then
at
the
bridge
and
the
view
and
then
at
me
i
was
afraid
lest
my
presence
should
disturb
the
happy
couple
i
slipped
away
and
took
refuge
behind
a
thicket
of
elder
trees
which
completely
screened
me
from
all
eyes
sitting
quietly
on
the
summit
of
the
bank
i
watched
the
landscape
and
the
little
girl
for
with
my
head
almost
on
a
level
with
the
boulevard
i
could
still
see
her
through
the
leaves
helene
seemed
uneasy
over
my
disappearance
her
dark
eyes
looked
for
me
down
the
alley
and
behind
the
trees
with
indefinable
curiosity
what
was
i
to
her
then
charles
baby
laughter
rang
out
like
a
bird
s
song
in
the
silence
the
tall
young
man
with
the
same
fair
hair
was
dancing
him
in
his
arms
showering
kisses
upon
him
and
the
meaningless
baby
words
of
that
little
language
which
rises
to
our
lips
when
we
play
with
children
the
mother
looked
on
smiling
now
and
then
doubtless
putting
in
some
low
word
that
came
up
from
the
heart
for
her
companion
would
stop
short
in
his
full
happiness
and
the
blue
eyes
that
turned
towards
her
were
full
of
glowing
light
and
love
and
worship
their
voices
blending
with
the
child
s
voice
reached
me
with
a
vague
sense
of
a
caress
the
three
figures
charming
in
themselves
composed
a
lovely
scene
in
a
glorious
landscape
filling
it
with
a
pervasive
unimaginable
grace
a
delicately
fair
woman
radiant
with
smiles
a
child
of
love
a
young
man
with
the
irresistible
charm
of
youth
a
cloudless
sky
nothing
was
wanting
in
nature
to
complete
a
perfect
harmony
for
the
delight
of
the
soul
i
found
myself
smiling
as
if
their
happiness
had
been
my
own
the
clocks
struck
nine
the
young
man
gave
a
tender
embrace
to
his
companion
and
went
towards
the
tilbury
which
an
old
servant
drove
slowly
to
meet
him
the
lady
had
grown
grave
and
almost
sad
the
child
s
prattle
sounded
unchecked
through
the
last
farewell
kisses
then
the
tilbury
rolled
away
and
the
lady
stood
motionless
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
wheels
watching
the
little
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
its
passage
along
the
road
charles
ran
down
the
green
pathway
back
to
the
bridge
to
join
his
sister
i
heard
his
silver
voice
calling
to
her
why
did
you
not
come
to
say
to
my
good
friend
cried
he
helene
looked
up
never
surely
did
such
hatred
gleam
from
a
child
s
eyes
as
from
hers
at
that
moment
when
she
turned
them
on
the
brother
who
stood
beside
her
on
the
bank
side
she
gave
him
an
angry
push
charles
lost
his
footing
on
the
steep
slope
stumbled
over
the
roots
of
a
tree
and
fell
headlong
forwards
dashing
his
forehead
on
the
stones
of
the
embankment
and
covered
with
blood
disappeared
over
the
edge
into
the
muddy
river
the
turbid
water
closed
over
a
fair
bright
head
with
a
shower
of
splashes
one
sharp
shriek
after
another
rang
in
my
ears
then
the
sounds
were
stifled
by
the
thick
stream
and
the
poor
child
sank
with
a
dull
sound
as
if
a
stone
had
been
thrown
into
the
water
the
accident
had
happened
with
more
than
lightning
swiftness
i
sprang
down
the
footpath
and
helene
stupefied
with
horror
shrieked
again
and
again
mamma
mamma
the
mother
was
there
at
my
side
she
had
flown
to
the
spot
like
a
bird
but
neither
a
mother
s
eyes
nor
mine
could
find
the
exact
place
where
the
little
one
had
gone
under
there
was
a
wide
space
of
black
hurrying
water
and
below
in
the
bed
of
the
bievre
ten
feet
of
mud
there
was
not
the
smallest
possibility
of
saving
the
child
no
one
was
stirring
at
that
hour
on
a
sunday
morning
and
there
are
neither
barges
nor
anglers
on
the
bievre
there
was
not
a
creature
in
sight
not
a
pole
to
plumb
the
filthy
stream
what
need
was
there
for
me
to
explain
how
the
accident
had
happened
accident
or
misfortune
whichever
it
might
be
had
helene
avenged
her
father
her
jealousy
surely
was
the
sword
of
god
and
yet
when
i
looked
at
the
mother
i
shivered
what
fearful
ordeal
awaited
her
when
she
should
return
to
her
husband
the
judge
before
whom
she
must
stand
all
her
days
and
here
with
her
was
an
inseparable
incorruptible
witness
a
child
s
forehead
is
transparent
a
child
s
face
hides
no
thoughts
and
a
lie
like
a
red
flame
set
within
glows
out
red
that
colors
even
the
eyes
but
the
unhappy
woman
had
not
thought
as
yet
of
the
punishment
awaiting
her
at
home
she
was
staring
into
the
bievre
such
an
event
must
inevitably
send
ghastly
echoes
through
a
woman
s
life
and
here
is
one
of
the
most
terrible
of
the
reverberations
that
troubled
julie
s
love
from
time
to
time
several
years
had
gone
by
the
marquis
de
vandenesse
wore
mourning
for
his
father
and
succeeded
to
his
estates
one
evening
therefore
after
dinner
it
happened
that
a
notary
was
present
in
his
house
this
was
no
pettifogging
lawyer
after
sterne
s
pattern
but
a
very
solid
substantial
notary
of
paris
one
of
your
estimable
men
who
do
a
stupid
thing
pompously
set
down
a
foot
heavily
upon
your
private
corn
and
then
ask
what
in
the
world
there
is
to
cry
out
about
if
by
accident
they
come
to
know
the
full
extent
of
the
enormity
upon
my
word
cry
they
i
hadn
t
a
notion
this
was
a
ass
in
short
who
could
see
nothing
in
life
but
deeds
and
documents
mme
de
aiglemont
had
been
dining
with
de
vandenesse
her
husband
had
excused
himself
before
dinner
was
over
for
he
was
taking
his
two
children
to
the
play
they
were
to
go
to
some
boulevard
theatre
or
other
to
the
or
the
gaiete
sensational
melodrama
being
judged
harmless
here
in
paris
and
suitable
pabulum
for
childhood
because
innocence
is
always
triumphant
in
the
fifth
act
the
boy
and
girl
had
teased
their
father
to
be
there
before
the
curtain
rose
so
he
had
left
the
table
before
dessert
was
served
but
the
notary
the
imperturbable
notary
utterly
incapable
of
asking
himself
why
mme
d
aiglemont
should
have
allowed
her
husband
and
children
to
go
without
her
to
the
play
sat
on
as
if
he
were
screwed
to
his
chair
dinner
was
over
dessert
had
been
prolonged
by
discussion
and
coffee
delayed
all
these
things
consumed
time
doubtless
precious
and
drew
impatient
movements
from
that
charming
woman
she
looked
not
unlike
a
thoroughbred
pawing
the
ground
before
a
race
but
the
man
of
law
to
whom
horses
and
women
were
equally
unknown
quantities
simply
thought
the
marquise
a
very
lively
and
sparkling
personage
so
enchanted
was
he
to
be
in
the
company
of
a
woman
of
fashion
and
a
political
celebrity
that
he
was
exerting
himself
to
shine
in
conversation
and
taking
the
lady
s
forced
smile
for
approbation
talked
on
with
unflagging
spirit
till
the
marquise
was
almost
out
of
patience
the
master
of
the
house
in
concert
with
the
lady
had
more
than
once
maintained
an
eloquent
silence
when
the
lawyer
expected
a
civil
reply
but
these
significant
pauses
were
employed
by
the
talkative
nuisance
in
looking
for
anecdotes
in
the
fire
de
vandenesse
had
recourse
to
his
watch
the
charming
marquise
tried
the
experiment
of
fastening
her
bonnet
strings
and
made
as
if
she
would
go
but
she
did
not
go
and
the
notary
blind
and
deaf
and
delighted
with
himself
was
quite
convinced
that
his
interesting
conversational
powers
were
sufficient
to
keep
the
lady
on
the
spot
i
shall
certainly
have
that
woman
for
a
client
said
he
to
himself
meanwhile
the
marquise
stood
putting
on
her
gloves
twisting
her
fingers
looking
from
the
equally
impatient
marquis
de
vandenesse
to
the
lawyer
still
pounding
away
at
every
pause
in
the
worthy
man
s
fire
of
witticisms
the
charming
pair
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
their
looks
said
plainly
at
last
he
is
really
going
nothing
of
the
kind
it
was
a
nightmare
which
could
only
end
in
exasperating
the
two
impassioned
creatures
on
whom
the
lawyer
had
something
of
the
fascinating
effect
of
a
snake
on
a
pair
of
birds
before
long
they
would
be
driven
to
cut
him
short
the
clever
notary
was
giving
them
the
history
of
the
discreditable
ways
in
which
one
du
tillet
a
stockbroker
then
much
in
favor
had
laid
the
foundations
of
his
fortune
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
whole
disgraceful
business
were
accurately
put
before
them
and
the
narrator
was
in
the
very
middle
of
his
tale
when
de
vandenesse
heard
the
clock
strike
nine
then
it
became
clear
to
him
that
his
legal
adviser
was
very
emphatically
an
idiot
who
must
be
sent
forthwith
about
his
business
he
stopped
him
resolutely
with
a
gesture
the
tongs
my
lord
marquis
queried
the
notary
handing
the
object
in
question
to
his
client
no
monsieur
i
am
compelled
to
send
you
away
mme
d
aiglemont
wishes
to
join
her
children
and
i
shall
have
the
honor
of
escorting
nine
o
clock
already
time
goes
like
a
shadow
in
pleasant
company
said
the
man
of
law
who
had
talked
on
end
for
the
past
hour
he
looked
for
his
hat
planted
himself
before
the
fire
with
a
suppressed
hiccough
and
without
heeding
the
marquise
s
withering
glances
spoke
once
more
to
his
impatient
client
to
sum
up
my
lord
marquis
business
before
all
things
then
we
must
subpoena
your
brother
we
will
proceed
to
make
out
the
inventory
and
faith
after
that
so
ill
had
the
lawyer
understood
his
instructions
that
his
impression
was
the
exact
opposite
to
the
one
intended
it
was
a
delicate
matter
and
vandenesse
in
spite
of
himself
began
to
put
the
notary
right
the
discussion
which
followed
took
up
a
certain
amount
of
time
listen
the
diplomatist
said
at
last
at
a
sign
from
the
lady
you
are
puzzling
my
brains
come
back
and
if
the
writ
is
not
issued
by
noon
the
days
of
grace
will
expire
and
then
as
he
spoke
a
carriage
entered
the
courtyard
the
poor
woman
turned
sharply
away
at
the
sound
to
hide
the
tears
in
her
eyes
the
marquis
rang
to
give
the
servant
orders
to
say
that
he
was
not
at
home
but
before
the
footman
could
answer
the
bell
the
lady
s
husband
reappeared
he
had
returned
unexpectedly
from
the
gaiete
and
held
both
children
by
the
hand
the
little
girl
s
eyes
were
red
the
boy
was
fretful
and
very
cross
what
can
have
happened
asked
the
marquise
i
will
tell
you
by
and
by
said
the
general
and
catching
a
glimpse
through
an
open
door
of
newspapers
on
the
table
in
the
adjoining
he
went
off
the
marquise
at
the
end
of
her
patience
flung
herself
down
on
the
sofa
in
desperation
the
notary
thinking
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
be
amiable
with
the
children
spoke
to
the
little
boy
in
an
insinuating
tone
well
my
little
man
and
what
is
there
on
at
the
theatre
valley
of
the
said
gustave
sulkily
upon
my
word
and
honor
declared
the
notary
authors
nowadays
are
half
crazy
valley
of
the
why
not
the
torrent
of
the
valley
it
is
conceivable
that
a
valley
might
be
without
a
torrent
in
it
now
if
they
had
said
the
torrent
of
the
valley
that
would
have
been
something
clear
something
precise
something
definite
and
comprehensible
but
never
mind
that
now
how
is
the
drama
to
take
place
in
a
torrent
and
in
a
valley
you
will
tell
me
that
in
these
days
the
principal
attraction
lies
in
the
scenic
effect
and
the
title
is
a
capital
and
did
you
enjoy
it
my
little
friend
he
continued
sitting
down
before
the
child
when
the
notary
pursued
his
inquiries
as
to
the
possibilities
of
a
drama
in
the
bed
of
a
torrent
the
little
girl
turned
slowly
away
and
began
to
cry
her
mother
did
not
notice
this
in
her
intense
annoyance
oh
yes
monsieur
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
said
the
child
there
is
a
dear
little
boy
in
the
play
and
he
was
all
alone
in
the
world
because
his
papa
could
not
have
been
his
real
papa
and
when
he
came
to
the
top
of
the
bridge
over
the
torrent
a
big
naughty
man
with
a
beard
dressed
all
in
black
came
and
threw
him
into
the
water
and
then
helene
began
to
sob
and
cry
and
everybody
scolded
us
and
father
brought
us
away
quick
quick
de
vandenesse
and
the
marquise
looked
on
in
dull
amazement
as
if
all
power
to
think
or
move
had
been
suddenly
paralyzed
do
be
quiet
gustave
cried
the
general
i
told
you
that
you
were
not
to
talk
about
anything
that
happened
at
the
play
and
you
have
forgotten
what
i
said
oh
my
lord
marquis
your
lordship
must
excuse
him
cried
the
notary
i
ought
not
to
have
asked
questions
but
i
had
no
idea
he
ought
not
to
have
answered
them
said
the
general
looking
sternly
at
the
child
it
seemed
that
the
marquise
and
the
master
of
the
house
both
perfectly
understood
why
the
children
had
come
back
so
suddenly
mme
d
aiglemont
looked
at
her
daughter
and
rose
as
if
to
go
to
her
but
a
terrible
convulsion
passed
over
her
face
and
all
that
could
be
read
in
it
was
relentless
severity
that
will
do
helene
she
said
go
into
the
other
room
and
leave
off
what
can
she
have
done
poor
child
asked
the
notary
thinking
to
appease
the
mother
s
anger
and
to
stop
helene
s
tears
at
one
stroke
so
pretty
as
she
is
she
must
be
as
good
as
can
be
never
anything
but
a
joy
to
her
mother
i
will
be
bound
isn
t
that
so
my
little
girl
helene
cowered
looked
at
her
mother
dried
her
eyes
struggled
for
composure
and
took
refuge
in
the
next
room
and
you
madame
are
too
good
a
mother
not
to
love
all
your
children
alike
you
are
too
good
a
woman
besides
to
have
any
of
those
lamentable
preferences
which
have
such
fatal
effects
as
we
lawyers
have
only
too
much
reason
to
know
society
goes
through
our
hands
we
see
its
passions
in
that
most
revolting
form
greed
here
it
is
the
mother
of
a
family
trying
to
disinherit
her
husband
s
children
to
enrich
the
others
whom
she
loves
better
or
it
is
the
husband
who
tries
to
leave
all
his
property
to
the
child
who
has
done
his
best
to
earn
his
mother
s
hatred
and
then
begin
quarrels
and
fears
and
deeds
and
defeasances
and
sham
sales
and
trusts
and
all
the
rest
of
it
a
pretty
mess
in
fact
it
is
pitiable
upon
my
honor
pitiable
there
are
fathers
that
will
spend
their
whole
lives
in
cheating
their
children
and
robbing
their
wives
yes
robbing
is
the
only
word
for
it
we
were
talking
of
tragedy
oh
i
can
assure
you
of
this
that
if
we
were
at
liberty
to
tell
the
real
reasons
of
some
donations
that
i
know
of
our
modern
dramatists
would
have
the
material
for
some
sensational
dramas
how
the
wife
manages
to
get
her
way
as
she
invariably
does
i
can
not
think
for
in
spite
of
appearances
and
in
spite
of
their
weakness
it
is
always
the
women
who
carry
the
day
ah
by
the
way
they
don
t
take
in
i
always
know
the
reason
at
the
bottom
of
those
predilections
which
the
world
politely
styles
but
in
justice
to
the
husbands
i
must
say
that
never
discover
anything
you
will
tell
me
that
this
is
a
merciful
dispens
helene
had
come
back
to
the
with
her
father
and
was
listening
attentively
so
well
did
she
understand
all
that
was
said
that
she
gave
her
mother
a
frightened
glance
feeling
with
a
child
s
quick
instinct
that
these
remarks
would
aggravate
the
punishment
hanging
over
her
the
marquise
turned
her
white
face
to
vandenesse
and
with
terror
in
her
eyes
indicated
her
husband
who
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
absently
on
the
flower
pattern
of
the
carpet
the
diplomatist
accomplished
man
of
the
world
though
he
was
could
no
longer
contain
his
wrath
he
gave
the
man
of
law
a
withering
glance
step
this
way
sir
he
said
and
he
went
hurriedly
to
the
door
of
the
the
notary
left
his
sentence
half
finished
and
followed
quaking
and
the
husband
and
wife
were
left
together
now
sir
said
the
marquise
de
vandenesse
he
banged
the
door
and
spoke
with
concentrated
rage
ever
since
dinner
you
have
done
nothing
but
make
blunders
and
talk
folly
for
heaven
s
sake
go
you
will
make
the
most
frightful
mischief
before
you
have
done
if
you
are
a
clever
man
in
your
profession
keep
to
your
profession
and
if
by
any
chance
you
should
go
into
society
endeavor
to
be
more
with
that
he
went
back
to
the
and
did
not
even
wish
the
notary
for
a
moment
that
worthy
stood
dumfounded
bewildered
utterly
at
a
loss
then
when
the
buzzing
in
his
ears
subsided
he
thought
he
heard
someone
moaning
in
the
next
room
footsteps
came
and
went
and
bells
were
violently
rung
he
was
by
no
means
anxious
to
meet
the
marquis
again
and
found
the
use
of
his
legs
to
make
good
his
escape
only
to
run
against
a
hurrying
crowd
of
servants
at
the
door
just
the
way
of
all
these
grand
folk
said
he
to
himself
outside
in
the
street
as
he
looked
about
for
a
cab
they
lead
you
on
to
talk
with
compliments
and
you
think
you
are
amusing
them
not
a
bit
of
it
they
treat
you
insolently
put
you
at
a
distance
even
put
you
out
at
the
door
without
scruple
after
all
i
talked
very
cleverly
i
said
nothing
but
what
was
sensible
well
turned
and
discreet
and
upon
my
word
he
advises
me
to
be
more
circumspect
in
future
i
will
take
good
care
of
that
eh
the
mischief
take
it
i
am
a
notary
and
a
member
of
my
chamber
pshaw
it
was
an
ambassador
s
fit
of
temper
nothing
is
sacred
for
people
of
that
kind
he
shall
explain
what
he
meant
by
saying
that
i
had
done
nothing
but
blunder
and
talk
nonsense
in
his
house
i
will
ask
him
for
an
explanation
that
is
i
will
ask
him
to
explain
my
mistake
after
all
is
done
and
said
i
am
in
the
wrong
perhaps
upon
my
word
it
is
very
good
of
me
to
cudgel
my
brains
like
this
what
business
is
it
of
mine
so
the
notary
went
home
and
laid
the
enigma
before
his
spouse
with
a
complete
account
of
the
evening
s
events
related
in
sequence
and
she
replied
my
dear
crottat
his
excellency
was
perfectly
right
when
he
said
that
you
had
done
nothing
but
blunder
and
talk
why
my
dear
if
i
told
you
why
it
would
not
prevent
you
from
doing
the
same
thing
somewhere
else
i
tell
you
again
talk
of
nothing
but
business
when
you
go
out
that
is
my
advice
to
if
you
will
not
tell
me
i
shall
ask
him
why
dear
me
the
veriest
noodle
is
careful
to
hide
a
thing
of
that
kind
and
do
you
suppose
that
an
ambassador
will
tell
you
about
it
really
crottat
i
have
never
known
you
so
utterly
devoid
of
thank
you
my
two
meetings
one
of
napoleon
s
orderly
who
shall
be
known
in
this
history
only
as
the
general
or
the
marquis
had
come
to
spend
the
spring
at
versailles
he
made
a
large
fortune
under
the
restoration
and
as
his
place
at
court
would
not
allow
him
to
go
very
far
from
paris
he
had
taken
a
country
house
between
the
church
and
the
barrier
of
montreuil
on
the
road
that
leads
to
the
avenue
de
the
house
had
been
built
originally
as
a
retreat
for
the
loves
of
some
the
grounds
were
very
large
the
gardens
on
either
side
extending
from
the
first
houses
of
montreuil
to
the
thatched
cottages
near
the
barrier
so
that
the
owner
could
enjoy
all
the
pleasures
of
solitude
with
the
city
almost
at
his
gates
by
an
odd
piece
of
contradiction
the
whole
front
of
the
house
itself
with
the
principal
entrance
gave
directly
upon
the
street
perhaps
in
time
past
it
was
a
tolerably
lonely
road
and
indeed
this
theory
looks
all
the
more
probable
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
for
not
so
very
far
away
on
this
same
road
louis
quinze
built
a
delicious
summer
villa
for
mlle
de
romans
and
the
curious
in
such
things
will
discover
that
the
wayside
are
adorned
in
a
style
that
recalls
traditions
of
the
ingenious
taste
displayed
in
debauchery
by
our
ancestors
who
with
all
the
license
paid
to
their
charge
sought
to
invest
it
with
secrecy
and
mystery
one
winter
evening
the
family
were
by
themselves
in
the
lonely
house
the
servants
had
received
permission
to
go
to
versailles
to
celebrate
the
wedding
of
one
of
their
number
it
was
christmas
time
and
the
holiday
makers
presuming
upon
the
double
festival
did
not
scruple
to
outstay
their
leave
of
absence
yet
as
the
general
was
well
known
to
be
a
man
of
his
word
the
culprits
felt
some
twinges
of
conscience
as
they
danced
on
after
the
hour
of
return
the
clocks
struck
eleven
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
the
servants
a
deep
silence
prevailed
over
the
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
the
northeast
wind
whistling
through
the
black
branches
wailing
about
the
house
dying
in
gusts
along
the
corridors
the
hard
frost
had
purified
the
air
and
held
the
earth
in
its
grip
the
roads
gave
back
every
sound
with
the
hard
metallic
ring
which
always
strikes
us
with
a
new
surprise
the
heavy
footsteps
of
some
belated
reveler
or
a
cab
returning
to
paris
could
be
heard
for
a
long
distance
with
unwonted
distinctness
out
in
the
courtyard
a
few
dead
leaves
set
by
some
eddying
gust
found
a
voice
for
the
night
which
fain
had
been
silent
it
was
in
fact
one
of
those
sharp
frosty
evenings
that
wring
barren
expressions
of
pity
from
our
selfish
ease
for
wayfarers
and
the
poor
and
fills
us
with
a
luxurious
sense
of
the
comfort
of
the
fireside
but
the
family
party
in
the
salon
at
that
hour
gave
not
a
thought
to
absent
servants
nor
houseless
folk
nor
to
the
gracious
charm
with
which
a
winter
evening
sparkles
no
one
played
the
philosopher
out
of
season
secure
in
the
protection
of
an
old
soldier
women
and
children
gave
themselves
up
to
the
joys
of
home
life
so
delicious
when
there
is
no
restraint
upon
feeling
and
talk
and
play
and
glances
are
bright
with
frankness
and
affection
the
general
sat
or
more
properly
speaking
lay
buried
in
the
depths
of
a
huge
armchair
by
the
hearth
the
fire
burned
scorching
clear
with
the
excessive
cold
of
the
night
the
good
father
leaned
his
head
slightly
to
one
side
against
the
back
of
the
chair
in
the
indolence
of
perfect
serenity
and
a
glow
of
happiness
the
languid
droop
of
his
outstretched
arms
seemed
to
complete
his
expression
of
placid
content
he
was
watching
his
youngest
a
boy
of
five
or
thereabouts
who
half
clad
as
he
was
declined
to
allow
his
mother
to
undress
him
the
little
one
fled
from
the
and
cap
with
which
he
was
threatened
now
and
again
and
stoutly
declined
to
part
with
his
embroidered
collar
laughing
when
his
mother
called
to
him
for
he
saw
that
she
too
was
laughing
at
this
declaration
of
infant
independence
the
next
step
was
to
go
back
to
a
game
of
romps
with
his
sister
she
was
as
much
a
child
as
he
but
more
mischievous
and
she
was
older
by
two
years
and
could
speak
distinctly
already
whereas
his
inarticulate
words
and
confused
ideas
were
a
puzzle
even
to
his
parents
little
moina
s
playfulness
somewhat
coquettish
already
provoked
inextinguishable
laughter
explosions
of
merriment
which
went
off
like
fireworks
for
no
apparent
cause
as
they
tumbled
about
before
the
fire
unconcernedly
displaying
little
plump
bodies
and
delicate
white
contours
as
the
dark
and
golden
curls
mingled
in
a
collision
of
rosy
cheeks
dimpled
with
childish
glee
a
father
surely
a
mother
most
certainly
must
have
understood
those
little
souls
and
seen
the
character
and
power
of
passion
already
developed
for
their
eyes
as
the
cherubs
frolicked
about
struggling
rolling
and
tumbling
without
fear
of
hurt
on
the
soft
carpet
its
flowers
looked
pale
beside
the
glowing
white
and
red
of
their
cheeks
and
the
brilliant
color
of
their
shining
eyes
on
the
sofa
by
the
fire
opposite
the
great
armchair
the
children
s
mother
sat
among
a
heap
of
scattered
garments
with
a
little
scarlet
shoe
in
her
hand
she
seemed
to
have
given
herself
up
completely
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
moment
wavering
discipline
had
relaxed
into
a
sweet
smile
engraved
upon
her
lips
at
the
age
of
or
thereabouts
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
still
by
reason
of
the
rare
perfection
of
the
outlines
of
her
face
and
at
this
moment
light
and
warmth
and
happiness
filled
it
with
preternatural
brightness
again
and
again
her
eyes
wandered
from
her
children
and
their
tender
gaze
was
turned
upon
her
husband
s
grave
face
and
now
and
again
the
eyes
of
husband
and
wife
met
with
a
silent
exchange
of
happiness
and
thoughts
from
some
inner
depth
the
general
s
face
was
deeply
bronzed
a
stray
lock
of
gray
hair
scored
shadows
on
his
forehead
the
reckless
courage
of
the
battlefield
could
be
read
in
the
lines
carved
in
his
hollow
cheeks
and
gleams
of
rugged
strength
in
the
blue
eyes
clearly
the
bit
of
red
ribbon
flaunting
at
his
had
been
paid
for
by
hardship
and
toil
an
inexpressible
kindliness
and
frankness
shone
out
of
the
strong
resolute
face
which
reflected
his
children
s
merriment
the
captain
found
it
not
so
very
hard
to
become
a
child
again
is
there
not
always
a
little
love
of
children
in
the
heart
of
a
soldier
who
has
seen
enough
of
the
seamy
side
of
life
to
know
something
of
the
piteous
limitations
of
strength
and
the
privileges
of
weakness
at
a
round
table
rather
further
away
in
a
circle
of
bright
lamplight
that
dimmed
the
feebler
illumination
of
the
wax
candles
on
the
sat
a
boy
of
thirteen
rapidly
turning
the
pages
of
a
thick
volume
which
he
was
reading
undisturbed
by
the
shouts
of
the
children
there
was
a
boy
s
curiosity
in
his
face
from
his
uniform
he
was
evidently
a
schoolboy
and
the
book
he
was
reading
was
the
small
wonder
that
he
was
deeply
absorbed
he
sat
perfectly
still
in
a
meditative
attitude
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
hand
propping
his
head
the
white
fingers
contrasting
strongly
with
the
brown
hair
into
which
they
were
thrust
as
he
sat
with
the
light
turned
full
upon
his
face
and
the
rest
of
his
body
in
shadow
he
looked
like
one
of
raphael
s
dark
portraits
of
himself
a
bent
head
and
intent
eyes
filled
with
visions
of
the
future
between
the
table
and
the
marquise
a
tall
beautiful
girl
sat
at
her
tapestry
frame
sometimes
she
drew
back
from
her
work
sometimes
she
bent
over
it
and
her
hair
picturesque
in
its
ebony
smoothness
and
darkness
caught
the
light
of
the
lamp
helene
was
a
picture
in
herself
in
her
beauty
there
was
a
rare
distinctive
character
of
power
and
refinement
though
her
hair
was
gathered
up
and
drawn
back
from
her
face
so
as
to
trace
a
clearly
marked
line
about
her
head
so
thick
and
abundant
was
it
so
recalcitrant
to
the
comb
that
it
sprang
back
in
to
the
nape
of
her
neck
the
bountiful
line
of
eyebrows
was
evenly
marked
out
in
dark
contrasting
outline
upon
her
pure
forehead
on
her
upper
lip
beneath
the
grecian
nose
with
its
sensitively
perfect
curve
of
nostril
there
lay
a
faint
swarthy
shadow
the
of
courage
but
the
enchanting
roundness
of
contour
the
frankly
innocent
expression
of
her
other
features
the
transparence
of
the
delicate
carnations
the
voluptuous
softness
of
the
lips
the
flawless
oval
of
the
outline
of
the
face
and
with
these
and
more
than
all
these
the
saintlike
expression
in
the
girlish
eyes
gave
to
her
vigorous
loveliness
the
distinctive
touch
of
feminine
grace
that
enchanting
modesty
which
we
look
for
in
these
angels
of
peace
and
love
yet
there
was
no
suggestion
of
fragility
about
her
and
surely
with
so
grand
a
woman
s
frame
so
attractive
a
face
she
must
possess
a
corresponding
warmth
of
heart
and
strength
of
soul
she
was
as
silent
as
her
schoolboy
brother
seemingly
a
prey
to
the
fateful
maiden
meditations
which
baffle
a
father
s
penetration
and
even
a
mother
s
sagacity
it
was
impossible
to
be
certain
whether
it
was
the
lamplight
that
cast
those
shadows
that
flitted
over
her
face
like
thin
clouds
over
a
bright
sky
or
whether
they
were
passing
shades
of
secret
and
painful
thoughts
husband
and
wife
had
quite
forgotten
the
two
older
children
at
that
moment
though
now
and
again
the
general
s
questioning
glance
traveled
to
that
second
mute
picture
a
larger
growth
a
gracious
realization
as
it
were
of
the
hopes
embodied
in
the
baby
forms
rioting
in
the
foreground
their
faces
made
up
a
kind
of
living
poem
illustrating
life
s
various
phases
the
luxurious
background
of
the
salon
the
different
attitudes
the
strong
contrasts
of
coloring
in
the
faces
differing
with
the
character
of
differing
ages
the
modeling
of
the
forms
brought
into
high
relief
by
the
light
altogether
it
was
a
page
of
human
life
richly
illuminated
beyond
the
art
of
painter
sculptor
or
poet
silence
solitude
night
and
winter
lent
a
final
touch
of
majesty
to
complete
the
simplicity
and
sublimity
of
this
exquisite
effect
of
nature
s
contriving
married
life
is
full
of
these
sacred
hours
which
perhaps
owe
their
indefinable
charm
to
some
vague
memory
of
a
better
world
a
divine
radiance
surely
shines
upon
them
the
destined
compensation
for
some
portion
of
earth
s
sorrows
the
solace
which
enables
man
to
accept
life
we
seem
to
behold
a
vision
of
an
enchanted
universe
the
great
conception
of
its
system
widens
out
before
our
eyes
and
social
life
pleads
for
its
laws
by
bidding
us
look
to
the
future
yet
in
spite
of
the
tender
glances
that
helene
gave
abel
and
moina
after
a
fresh
outburst
of
merriment
in
spite
of
the
look
of
gladness
in
her
transparent
face
whenever
she
stole
a
glance
at
her
father
a
deep
melancholy
pervaded
her
gestures
her
attitude
and
more
than
all
her
eyes
veiled
by
their
long
lashes
those
white
strong
hands
through
which
the
light
passed
tinting
them
with
a
diaphanous
almost
fluid
red
those
hands
were
trembling
once
only
did
the
eyes
of
the
mother
and
daughter
clash
without
shrinking
and
the
two
women
read
each
other
s
thoughts
in
a
look
cold
wan
and
respectful
on
helene
s
part
sombre
and
threatening
on
her
mother
s
at
once
helene
s
eyes
were
lowered
to
her
work
she
plied
her
needle
swiftly
and
it
was
long
before
she
raised
her
head
bowed
as
it
seemed
by
a
weight
of
thought
too
heavy
to
bear
was
the
marquise
over
harsh
with
this
one
of
her
children
did
she
think
this
harshness
needful
was
she
jealous
of
helene
s
beauty
she
might
still
hope
to
rival
helene
but
only
by
the
magic
arts
of
the
toilette
or
again
had
her
daughter
like
many
a
girl
who
reaches
the
clairvoyant
age
read
the
secrets
which
this
wife
to
all
appearance
so
religiously
faithful
in
the
fulfilment
of
her
duties
believed
to
be
buried
in
her
own
heart
as
deeply
as
in
a
grave
helene
had
reached
an
age
when
purity
of
soul
inclines
to
pass
judgments
a
certain
order
of
mind
is
apt
to
exaggerate
transgression
into
crime
imagination
reacts
upon
conscience
and
a
young
girl
is
a
hard
judge
because
she
magnifies
the
seriousness
of
the
offence
helene
seemed
to
think
herself
worthy
of
no
one
perhaps
there
was
a
secret
in
her
past
life
perhaps
something
had
happened
unintelligible
to
her
at
the
time
but
with
gradually
developing
significance
for
a
mind
grown
susceptible
to
religious
influences
something
which
lately
seemed
to
have
degraded
her
as
it
were
in
her
own
eyes
and
according
to
her
own
romantic
standard
this
change
in
her
demeanor
dated
from
the
day
of
reading
schiller
s
noble
tragedy
of
in
a
new
series
of
translations
her
mother
scolded
her
for
letting
the
book
fall
and
then
remarked
to
herself
that
the
passage
which
had
so
worked
on
helene
s
feelings
was
the
scene
in
which
wilhelm
tell
who
spilt
the
blood
of
a
tyrant
to
save
a
nation
fraternizes
in
some
sort
with
john
the
parricide
helene
had
grown
humble
dutiful
and
she
no
longer
cared
for
gaiety
never
had
she
made
so
much
of
her
father
especially
when
the
marquise
was
not
by
to
watch
her
girlish
caresses
and
yet
if
helene
s
affection
for
her
mother
had
cooled
at
all
the
change
in
her
manner
was
so
slight
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
so
slight
that
the
general
could
not
have
noticed
it
jealous
though
he
might
be
of
the
harmony
of
home
no
masculine
insight
could
have
sounded
the
depths
of
those
two
feminine
natures
the
one
was
young
and
generous
the
other
sensitive
and
proud
the
first
had
a
wealth
of
indulgence
in
her
nature
the
second
was
full
of
craft
and
love
if
the
marquise
made
her
daughter
s
life
a
burden
to
her
by
a
woman
s
subtle
tyranny
it
was
a
tyranny
invisible
to
all
but
the
victim
and
for
the
rest
these
conjectures
only
called
forth
after
the
event
must
remain
conjectures
until
this
night
no
accusing
flash
of
light
had
escaped
either
of
them
but
an
ominous
mystery
was
too
surely
growing
up
between
them
a
mystery
known
only
to
themselves
and
god
come
abel
called
the
marquise
seizing
on
her
opportunity
when
the
children
were
tired
of
play
and
still
for
a
moment
come
come
child
you
must
be
put
to
bed
and
with
a
glance
that
must
be
obeyed
she
caught
him
up
and
took
him
on
her
knee
what
exclaimed
the
general
ten
o
clock
and
not
one
of
the
servants
has
come
back
the
rascals
gustave
he
added
turning
to
his
son
i
allowed
you
to
read
that
book
only
on
the
condition
that
you
should
put
it
away
at
ten
o
clock
you
ought
to
have
shut
up
the
book
at
the
proper
time
and
gone
to
bed
as
you
promised
if
you
mean
to
make
your
mark
in
the
world
you
must
keep
your
word
let
it
be
a
second
religion
to
you
and
a
point
of
honor
fox
one
of
the
greatest
english
orators
was
remarkable
above
all
things
for
the
beauty
of
his
character
and
the
very
first
of
his
qualities
was
the
scrupulous
faithfulness
with
which
he
kept
his
engagements
when
he
was
a
child
his
father
an
englishman
of
the
old
school
gave
him
a
pretty
strong
lesson
which
he
never
forgot
like
most
rich
englishmen
fox
s
father
had
a
country
house
and
a
considerable
park
about
it
now
in
the
park
there
was
an
old
and
orders
had
been
given
that
this
was
to
be
pulled
down
and
put
up
somewhere
else
where
there
was
a
finer
view
fox
was
just
about
your
age
and
had
come
home
for
the
holidays
boys
are
fond
of
seeing
things
pulled
to
pieces
so
young
fox
asked
to
stay
on
at
home
for
a
few
days
longer
to
see
the
old
taken
down
but
his
father
said
that
he
must
go
back
to
school
on
the
proper
day
so
there
was
anger
between
father
and
son
fox
s
mother
like
all
mammas
took
the
boy
s
part
then
the
father
solemnly
promised
that
the
should
stay
where
it
was
till
the
next
holidays
so
fox
went
back
to
school
and
his
father
thinking
that
lessons
would
soon
drive
the
whole
thing
out
of
the
boy
s
mind
had
the
pulled
down
and
put
up
in
the
new
position
but
as
it
happened
the
persistent
youngster
thought
of
nothing
but
that
and
as
soon
as
he
came
home
again
his
first
care
was
to
go
out
to
look
at
the
old
building
and
he
came
in
to
breakfast
looking
quite
doleful
and
said
to
his
father
you
have
broken
your
the
old
english
gentleman
said
with
confusion
full
of
dignity
that
is
true
my
boy
but
i
will
make
amends
a
man
ought
to
think
of
keeping
his
word
before
he
thinks
of
his
fortune
for
by
keeping
his
word
he
will
gain
fortune
while
all
the
fortunes
in
the
world
will
not
efface
the
stain
left
on
your
conscience
by
a
breach
of
then
he
gave
orders
that
the
should
be
put
up
again
in
the
old
place
and
when
it
had
been
rebuilt
he
had
it
taken
down
again
for
his
son
to
see
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
gustave
had
been
listening
with
interest
and
now
he
closed
the
book
at
once
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
while
the
general
took
possession
of
moina
who
could
scarcely
keep
her
eyes
open
the
little
one
s
languid
head
fell
back
on
her
father
s
breast
and
in
a
moment
she
was
fast
asleep
wrapped
round
about
in
her
golden
curls
just
then
a
sound
of
hurrying
footsteps
rang
on
the
pavement
out
in
the
street
immediately
followed
by
three
knocks
on
the
street
door
waking
the
echoes
of
the
house
the
reverberating
blows
told
as
plainly
as
a
cry
for
help
that
here
was
a
man
flying
for
his
life
the
house
dog
barked
furiously
a
thrill
of
excitement
ran
through
helene
and
gustave
and
the
general
and
his
wife
but
neither
abel
with
the
strings
just
tied
under
his
chin
nor
moina
awoke
the
fellow
is
in
a
hurry
exclaimed
the
general
he
put
the
little
girl
down
on
the
chair
and
hastened
out
of
the
room
heedless
of
his
wife
s
entreating
cry
dear
do
not
go
down
he
stepped
into
his
own
room
for
a
pair
of
pistols
lighted
a
dark
lantern
sprang
at
lightning
speed
down
the
staircase
and
in
another
minute
reached
the
house
door
his
oldest
boy
fearlessly
following
who
is
there
demanded
he
let
me
in
panted
a
breathless
voice
are
you
a
friend
yes
are
you
alone
yes
but
let
me
in
are
after
me
the
general
had
scarcely
set
the
door
ajar
before
a
man
slipped
into
the
porch
with
the
uncanny
swiftness
of
a
shadow
before
the
master
of
the
house
could
prevent
him
the
intruder
had
closed
the
door
with
a
kick
and
set
his
back
against
it
resolutely
as
if
he
were
determined
that
it
should
not
be
opened
again
in
a
moment
the
general
had
his
lantern
and
pistol
at
a
level
with
the
stranger
s
breast
and
beheld
a
man
of
medium
height
in
a
pelisse
it
was
an
old
man
s
garment
both
too
large
and
too
long
for
its
present
wearer
chance
or
caution
had
slouched
the
man
s
hat
over
his
eyes
you
can
lower
your
pistol
sir
said
this
person
i
do
not
claim
to
stay
in
your
house
against
your
will
but
if
i
leave
it
death
is
waiting
for
me
at
the
barrier
and
what
a
death
you
would
be
answerable
to
god
for
it
i
ask
for
your
hospitality
for
two
hours
and
bear
this
in
mind
sir
that
suppliant
as
i
am
i
have
a
right
to
command
with
the
despotism
of
necessity
i
want
the
arab
s
hospitality
either
i
and
my
secret
must
be
inviolable
or
open
the
door
and
i
will
go
to
my
death
i
want
secrecy
a
safe
and
water
oh
water
he
cried
again
with
a
rattle
in
his
throat
who
are
you
demanded
the
general
taken
aback
by
the
stranger
s
feverish
volubility
ah
who
am
i
good
open
the
door
and
i
will
put
a
distance
between
us
retorted
the
other
and
there
was
a
diabolical
irony
in
his
tone
dexterously
as
the
marquis
passed
the
light
of
the
lantern
over
the
man
s
face
he
could
only
see
the
lower
half
of
it
and
that
in
nowise
prepossessed
him
in
favor
of
this
singular
claimant
of
hospitality
the
cheeks
were
livid
and
quivering
the
features
dreadfully
contorted
under
the
shadow
of
the
a
pair
of
eyes
gleamed
out
like
flames
the
feeble
looked
almost
dim
in
comparison
some
sort
of
answer
must
be
made
however
your
language
sir
is
so
extraordinary
that
in
my
place
you
yourself
my
life
is
in
your
hands
the
intruder
broke
in
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
dreadful
to
hear
two
hours
said
the
marquis
wavering
two
hours
echoed
the
other
then
quite
suddenly
with
a
desperate
gesture
he
pushed
back
his
hat
and
left
his
forehead
bare
and
as
if
he
meant
to
try
a
final
expedient
he
gave
the
general
a
glance
that
seemed
to
plunge
like
a
vivid
flash
into
his
very
soul
that
electrical
discharge
of
intelligence
and
will
was
swift
as
lightning
and
crushing
as
a
thunderbolt
for
there
are
moments
when
a
human
being
is
invested
for
a
brief
space
with
inexplicable
power
come
whoever
you
may
be
you
shall
be
in
safety
under
my
roof
the
master
of
the
house
said
gravely
at
last
acting
as
he
imagined
upon
one
of
those
intuitions
which
a
man
can
not
always
explain
to
himself
god
will
repay
you
said
the
stranger
with
a
deep
involuntary
sigh
have
you
weapons
asked
the
general
for
all
answer
the
stranger
flung
open
his
fur
pelisse
and
scarcely
gave
the
other
time
for
a
glance
before
he
wrapped
it
about
him
again
to
all
appearance
he
was
unarmed
and
in
evening
dress
swift
as
the
soldier
s
scrutiny
had
been
he
saw
something
however
which
made
him
exclaim
where
the
devil
have
you
been
to
get
yourself
in
such
a
mess
in
such
dry
weather
more
questions
said
the
stranger
haughtily
at
the
words
the
marquis
caught
sight
of
his
son
and
his
own
late
homily
on
the
strict
fulfilment
of
a
given
word
came
up
to
his
mind
in
lively
vexation
he
exclaimed
not
without
a
touch
of
anger
what
little
rogue
you
here
when
you
ought
to
be
in
bed
because
i
thought
i
might
be
of
some
good
in
danger
answered
gustave
there
go
up
to
your
room
said
his
father
mollified
by
the
and
you
addressing
the
stranger
come
with
the
two
men
grew
as
silent
as
a
pair
of
gamblers
who
watch
each
other
s
play
with
mutual
suspicions
the
general
himself
began
to
be
troubled
with
ugly
presentiments
the
strange
visit
weighed
upon
his
mind
already
like
a
nightmare
but
he
had
passed
his
word
there
was
no
help
for
it
now
and
he
led
the
way
along
the
passages
and
stairways
till
they
reached
a
large
room
on
the
second
floor
immediately
above
the
salon
this
was
an
empty
room
where
linen
was
dried
in
the
winter
it
had
but
the
one
door
and
for
all
decoration
boasted
one
solitary
shabby
above
the
left
by
the
previous
owner
and
a
great
pier
glass
placed
provisionally
opposite
the
fireplace
until
such
time
as
a
use
should
be
found
for
it
in
the
rooms
below
the
four
yellowish
walls
were
bare
the
floor
had
never
been
swept
the
huge
attic
was
and
the
furniture
consisted
of
a
couple
of
rickety
chairs
or
rather
frames
of
chairs
the
general
set
the
lantern
down
upon
the
then
he
spoke
it
is
necessary
for
your
own
safety
to
hide
you
in
this
comfortless
attic
and
as
you
have
my
promise
to
keep
your
secret
you
will
permit
me
to
lock
you
the
other
bent
his
head
in
acquiescence
i
asked
for
nothing
but
a
secrecy
and
water
returned
he
i
will
bring
you
some
directly
said
the
marquis
shutting
the
door
cautiously
he
groped
his
way
down
into
the
salon
for
a
lamp
before
going
to
the
kitchen
to
look
for
a
carafe
well
what
is
it
the
marquise
asked
quickly
nothing
dear
he
returned
coolly
but
we
listened
and
we
certainly
heard
you
go
upstairs
with
helene
said
the
general
and
he
looked
at
his
daughter
who
raised
her
face
bear
in
mind
that
your
father
s
honor
depends
upon
your
discretion
you
must
have
heard
the
girl
bent
her
head
in
answer
the
marquise
was
confused
and
smarting
inwardly
at
the
way
in
which
her
husband
had
thought
fit
to
silence
her
meanwhile
the
general
went
for
the
bottle
and
a
tumbler
and
returned
to
the
room
above
his
prisoner
was
leaning
against
the
his
head
was
bare
he
had
flung
down
his
hat
on
one
of
the
two
chairs
evidently
he
had
not
expected
to
have
so
bright
a
light
turned
upon
him
and
he
frowned
and
looked
anxious
as
he
met
the
general
s
keen
eyes
but
his
face
softened
and
wore
a
gracious
expression
as
he
thanked
his
protector
when
the
latter
placed
the
bottle
and
glass
on
the
the
stranger
s
eyes
flashed
out
on
him
again
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
musical
tones
with
no
sign
of
the
previous
guttural
convulsion
though
his
voice
was
still
unsteady
with
repressed
emotion
i
shall
seem
to
you
to
be
a
strange
being
sir
but
you
must
pardon
the
caprices
of
necessity
if
you
propose
to
remain
in
the
room
i
beg
that
you
will
not
look
at
me
while
i
am
vexed
at
this
continual
obedience
to
a
man
whom
he
disliked
the
general
sharply
turned
his
back
upon
him
the
stranger
thereupon
drew
a
white
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
wound
it
about
his
right
hand
then
he
seized
the
carafe
and
emptied
it
at
a
draught
the
marquis
staring
vacantly
into
the
tall
mirror
across
the
room
without
a
thought
of
breaking
his
implicit
promise
saw
the
stranger
s
figure
distinctly
reflected
by
the
opposite
and
saw
too
a
red
stain
suddenly
appear
through
the
folds
of
the
white
bandage
the
man
s
hands
were
steeped
in
blood
ah
you
saw
me
cried
the
other
he
had
drunk
off
the
water
and
wrapped
himself
again
in
his
cloak
and
now
scrutinized
the
general
suspiciously
it
is
all
over
with
me
here
they
come
i
don
t
hear
anything
said
the
marquis
you
have
not
the
same
interest
that
i
have
in
listening
for
sounds
in
the
you
have
been
fighting
a
duel
i
suppose
to
be
in
such
a
state
queried
the
general
not
a
little
disturbed
by
the
color
of
those
broad
dark
patches
staining
his
visitor
s
cloak
yes
a
duel
you
have
it
said
the
other
and
a
bitter
smile
flitted
over
his
lips
as
he
spoke
a
sound
rang
along
the
distant
road
a
sound
of
galloping
horses
but
so
faint
as
yet
that
it
was
the
merest
dawn
of
a
sound
the
general
s
trained
ear
recognized
the
advance
of
a
troop
of
regulars
that
is
the
gendarmerie
said
he
he
glanced
at
his
prisoner
to
reassure
him
after
his
own
involuntary
indiscretion
took
the
lamp
and
went
down
to
the
salon
he
had
scarcely
laid
the
key
of
the
room
above
upon
the
when
the
hoof
beats
sounded
louder
and
came
swiftly
nearer
and
nearer
the
house
the
general
felt
a
shiver
of
excitement
and
indeed
the
horses
stopped
at
the
house
door
a
few
words
were
exchanged
among
the
men
and
one
of
them
dismounted
and
knocked
loudly
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
general
went
to
open
the
door
he
could
scarcely
conceal
his
inward
perturbation
at
the
sight
of
half
a
dozen
gendarmes
outside
the
metal
rims
of
their
caps
gleaming
like
silver
in
the
moonlight
my
lord
said
the
corporal
have
you
heard
a
man
run
past
towards
the
barrier
within
the
last
few
minutes
towards
the
barrier
have
you
opened
the
door
to
any
one
now
am
i
in
the
habit
of
answering
the
door
myself
i
ask
your
pardon
general
but
just
now
it
seems
to
me
that
really
cried
the
marquis
wrathfully
have
you
a
mind
to
try
joking
with
me
what
right
have
you
none
at
all
none
at
all
my
lord
cried
the
corporal
hastily
putting
in
a
soft
answer
you
will
excuse
our
zeal
we
know
of
course
that
a
peer
of
france
is
not
likely
to
harbor
a
murderer
at
this
time
of
night
but
as
we
want
any
information
we
can
get
a
murderer
cried
the
general
who
can
have
been
m
le
baron
de
mauny
has
just
been
murdered
it
was
a
blow
from
an
axe
and
we
are
in
hot
pursuit
of
the
criminal
we
know
for
certain
that
he
is
somewhere
in
this
neighborhood
and
we
shall
hunt
him
down
by
your
leave
general
and
the
man
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
as
he
spoke
it
was
well
that
he
did
so
for
a
corporal
of
gendarmerie
trained
to
alert
observation
and
quick
surmise
would
have
had
his
suspicions
at
once
if
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
general
s
face
everything
that
passed
through
the
soldier
s
mind
was
faithfully
revealed
in
his
frank
countenance
is
it
known
who
the
murderer
is
asked
he
no
said
the
other
now
in
the
saddle
he
left
the
bureau
full
of
banknotes
and
gold
it
was
revenge
then
said
the
marquis
on
an
old
man
pshaw
no
no
the
fellow
hadn
t
time
to
take
it
that
was
all
and
the
corporal
galloped
after
his
comrades
who
were
almost
out
of
sight
by
this
time
for
a
few
minutes
the
general
stood
a
victim
to
perplexities
which
need
no
explanation
but
in
a
moment
he
heard
the
servants
returning
home
their
voices
were
raised
in
some
sort
of
dispute
at
the
of
montreuil
when
they
came
in
he
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
an
explosion
of
rage
his
wrath
fell
upon
them
like
a
thunderbolt
and
all
the
echoes
of
the
house
trembled
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
his
own
man
the
boldest
and
cleverest
of
the
party
brought
out
an
excuse
they
had
been
stopped
he
said
by
the
gendarmerie
at
the
gate
of
montreuil
a
murder
had
been
committed
and
the
police
were
in
pursuit
in
a
moment
the
general
s
anger
vanished
he
said
not
another
word
then
bethinking
himself
of
his
own
singular
position
drily
ordered
them
all
off
to
bed
at
once
and
left
them
amazed
at
his
readiness
to
accept
their
fellow
servant
s
lying
excuse
while
these
incidents
took
place
in
the
yard
an
apparently
trifling
occurrence
had
changed
the
relative
positions
of
three
characters
in
this
story
the
marquis
had
scarcely
left
the
room
before
his
wife
looked
first
towards
the
key
on
the
and
then
at
helene
and
after
some
wavering
bent
towards
her
daughter
and
said
in
a
low
voice
helene
your
father
has
left
the
key
on
the
the
girl
looked
up
in
surprise
and
glanced
timidly
at
her
mother
the
marquise
s
eyes
sparkled
with
curiosity
well
mamma
she
said
and
her
voice
had
a
troubled
ring
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
going
on
upstairs
if
there
is
anybody
up
there
he
has
not
stirred
yet
just
go
up
cried
the
girl
with
something
like
horror
in
her
tones
are
you
afraid
no
mamma
but
i
thought
i
heard
a
man
s
if
i
could
go
myself
i
should
not
have
asked
you
to
go
helene
said
her
mother
with
cold
dignity
if
your
father
were
to
come
back
and
did
not
see
me
he
would
go
to
look
for
me
perhaps
but
he
would
not
notice
your
madame
if
you
bid
me
go
i
will
go
said
helene
but
i
shall
lose
my
father
s
good
opinion
what
is
this
cried
the
marquise
in
a
sarcastic
tone
but
since
you
take
a
thing
that
was
said
in
joke
in
earnest
i
now
you
to
go
upstairs
and
see
who
is
in
the
room
above
here
is
the
key
child
when
your
father
told
you
to
say
nothing
about
this
thing
that
happened
he
did
not
forbid
you
to
go
up
to
the
room
go
at
once
and
learn
that
a
daughter
ought
never
to
judge
her
the
last
words
were
spoken
with
all
the
severity
of
a
justly
offended
mother
the
marquise
took
the
key
and
handed
it
to
helene
who
rose
without
a
word
and
left
the
room
my
mother
can
always
easily
obtain
her
pardon
thought
the
girl
but
as
for
me
my
father
will
never
think
the
same
of
me
again
does
she
mean
to
rob
me
of
his
tenderness
does
she
want
to
turn
me
out
of
his
house
these
were
the
thoughts
that
set
her
imagination
in
a
sudden
ferment
as
she
went
down
the
dark
passage
to
the
mysterious
door
at
the
end
when
she
stood
before
it
her
mental
confusion
grew
to
a
fateful
pitch
feelings
hitherto
forced
down
into
inner
depths
crowded
up
at
the
summons
of
these
confused
thoughts
perhaps
hitherto
she
had
never
believed
that
a
happy
life
lay
before
her
but
now
in
this
awful
moment
her
despair
was
complete
she
shook
convulsively
as
she
set
the
key
in
the
lock
so
great
indeed
was
her
agitation
that
she
stopped
for
a
moment
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
heart
as
if
to
still
the
heavy
throbs
that
sounded
in
her
ears
then
she
opened
the
door
the
creaking
of
the
hinges
sounded
doubtless
in
vain
on
the
murderer
s
ears
acute
as
were
his
powers
of
hearing
he
stood
as
if
lost
in
thought
and
so
motionless
that
he
might
have
been
glued
to
the
wall
against
which
he
leaned
in
the
circle
of
darkness
dimly
lit
by
the
bull
lantern
he
looked
like
the
shadowy
figure
of
some
dead
knight
standing
for
ever
in
his
shadowy
mortuary
niche
in
the
gloom
of
some
gothic
chapel
drops
of
cold
sweat
trickled
over
the
broad
sallow
forehead
an
incredible
fearlessness
looked
out
from
every
tense
feature
his
eyes
of
fire
were
fixed
and
tearless
he
seemed
to
be
watching
some
struggle
in
the
darkness
beyond
him
stormy
thoughts
passed
swiftly
across
a
face
whose
firm
decision
spoke
of
a
character
of
no
common
order
his
whole
person
bearing
and
frame
bore
out
the
impression
of
a
tameless
spirit
the
man
looked
power
and
strength
personified
he
stood
facing
the
darkness
as
if
it
were
the
visible
image
of
his
own
future
these
physical
characteristics
had
made
no
impression
upon
the
general
familiar
as
he
was
with
the
powerful
faces
of
the
group
of
giants
gathered
about
napoleon
speculative
curiosity
moreover
as
to
the
why
and
wherefore
of
the
apparition
had
completely
filled
his
mind
but
helene
with
feminine
sensitiveness
to
surface
impressions
was
struck
by
the
blended
chaos
of
light
and
darkness
grandeur
and
passion
suggesting
a
likeness
between
this
stranger
and
lucifer
recovering
from
his
fall
suddenly
the
storm
apparent
in
his
face
was
stilled
as
if
by
magic
and
the
indefinable
power
to
sway
which
the
stranger
exercised
upon
others
and
perhaps
unconsciously
and
as
by
reflex
action
upon
himself
spread
its
influence
about
him
with
the
progressive
swiftness
of
a
flood
a
torrent
of
thought
rolled
away
from
his
brow
as
his
face
resumed
its
ordinary
expression
perhaps
it
was
the
strangeness
of
this
meeting
or
perhaps
it
was
the
mystery
into
which
she
had
penetrated
that
held
the
young
girl
spellbound
in
the
doorway
so
that
she
could
look
at
a
face
pleasant
to
behold
and
full
of
interest
for
some
moments
she
stood
in
the
magical
silence
a
trouble
had
come
upon
her
never
known
before
in
her
young
life
perhaps
some
exclamation
broke
from
helene
perhaps
she
moved
unconsciously
or
it
may
be
that
the
hunted
criminal
returned
of
his
own
accord
from
the
world
of
ideas
to
the
material
world
and
heard
some
one
breathing
in
the
room
however
it
was
he
turned
his
head
towards
his
host
s
daughter
and
saw
dimly
in
the
shadow
a
noble
face
and
queenly
form
which
he
must
have
taken
for
an
angel
s
so
motionless
she
stood
so
vague
and
like
a
spirit
monsieur
a
trembling
voice
cried
the
murderer
trembled
a
woman
he
cried
under
his
breath
is
it
possible
go
he
cried
i
deny
that
any
one
has
a
right
to
pity
to
absolve
or
condemn
me
i
must
live
alone
go
my
child
he
added
with
an
imperious
gesture
i
should
ill
requite
the
service
done
me
by
the
master
of
the
house
if
i
were
to
allow
a
single
creature
under
his
roof
to
breathe
the
same
air
with
me
i
must
submit
to
be
judged
by
the
laws
of
the
the
last
words
were
uttered
in
a
lower
voice
even
as
he
realized
with
a
profound
intuition
all
the
manifold
misery
awakened
by
that
melancholy
thought
the
glance
that
he
gave
helene
had
something
of
the
power
of
the
serpent
stirring
a
whole
dormant
world
in
the
mind
of
the
strange
girl
before
him
to
her
that
glance
was
like
a
light
revealing
unknown
lands
she
was
stricken
with
strange
trouble
helpless
quelled
by
a
magnetic
power
exerted
unconsciously
trembling
and
ashamed
she
went
out
and
returned
to
the
salon
she
had
scarcely
entered
the
room
before
her
father
came
back
so
that
she
had
not
time
to
say
a
word
to
her
mother
the
general
was
wholly
absorbed
in
thought
he
folded
his
arms
and
paced
silently
to
and
fro
between
the
windows
which
looked
out
upon
the
street
and
the
second
row
which
gave
upon
the
garden
his
wife
lay
the
sleeping
abel
on
her
knee
and
little
moina
lay
in
untroubled
slumber
in
the
low
chair
like
a
bird
in
its
nest
her
older
sister
stared
into
the
fire
a
skein
of
silk
in
one
hand
a
needle
in
the
other
deep
silence
prevailed
broken
only
by
lagging
footsteps
on
the
stairs
as
one
by
one
the
servants
crept
away
to
bed
there
was
an
occasional
burst
of
stifled
laughter
a
last
echo
of
the
wedding
festivity
or
doors
were
opened
as
they
still
talked
among
themselves
then
shut
a
smothered
sound
came
now
and
again
from
the
bedrooms
a
chair
fell
the
old
coachman
coughed
feebly
then
all
was
silent
in
a
little
while
the
dark
majesty
with
which
sleeping
earth
is
invested
at
midnight
brought
all
things
under
its
sway
no
lights
shone
but
the
light
of
the
stars
the
frost
gripped
the
ground
there
was
not
a
sound
of
a
voice
nor
a
living
creature
stirring
the
crackling
of
the
fire
only
seemed
to
make
the
depth
of
the
silence
more
fully
felt
the
church
clock
of
montreuil
had
just
struck
one
when
an
almost
inaudible
sound
of
a
light
footstep
came
from
the
second
flight
of
stairs
the
marquis
and
his
daughter
both
believing
that
de
mauny
s
murderer
was
a
prisoner
above
thought
that
one
of
the
maids
had
come
down
and
no
one
was
at
all
surprised
to
hear
the
door
open
in
the
quite
suddenly
the
murderer
appeared
in
their
midst
the
marquis
himself
was
sunk
in
deep
musings
the
mother
and
daughter
were
silent
the
one
from
keen
curiosity
the
other
from
sheer
astonishment
so
that
the
visitor
was
almost
across
the
room
when
he
spoke
to
the
general
sir
the
two
hours
are
almost
over
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
strangely
calm
and
musical
cried
the
general
by
what
means
and
he
gave
wife
and
daughter
a
formidable
questioning
glance
helene
grew
red
as
fire
you
he
went
on
in
a
tone
filled
with
horror
among
us
a
murderer
covered
with
blood
you
are
a
blot
on
this
picture
go
go
out
he
added
in
a
burst
of
rage
at
that
word
murderer
the
marquise
cried
out
as
for
helene
it
seemed
to
mark
an
epoch
in
her
life
there
was
not
a
trace
of
surprise
in
her
face
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
waiting
for
this
for
him
those
so
vast
thoughts
of
hers
had
found
a
meaning
the
punishment
reserved
by
heaven
for
her
sins
flamed
out
before
her
in
her
own
eyes
she
was
as
great
a
criminal
as
this
murderer
she
confronted
him
with
her
quiet
gaze
she
was
his
fellow
his
sister
it
seemed
to
her
that
in
this
accident
the
command
of
god
had
been
made
manifest
if
she
had
been
a
few
years
older
reason
would
have
disposed
of
her
remorse
but
at
this
moment
she
was
like
one
distraught
the
stranger
stood
impassive
and
a
scornful
smile
overspread
his
features
and
his
thick
red
lips
you
appreciate
the
magnanimity
of
my
behavior
very
badly
he
said
slowly
i
would
not
touch
with
my
fingers
the
glass
of
water
you
brought
me
to
allay
my
thirst
i
did
not
so
much
as
think
of
washing
my
hands
under
your
roof
i
am
going
away
leaving
nothing
of
here
his
lips
were
compressed
but
the
memory
i
have
tried
to
leave
no
trace
of
my
presence
in
this
house
indeed
i
would
not
even
allow
your
daughter
to
cried
the
general
with
a
glance
at
helene
vile
wretch
go
or
i
will
kill
you
the
two
hours
are
not
yet
over
said
the
other
if
you
kill
me
or
give
me
up
you
must
lower
yourself
in
your
own
eyes
and
in
at
these
last
words
the
general
turned
to
stare
at
the
criminal
in
dumb
amazement
but
he
could
not
endure
the
intolerable
light
in
those
eyes
which
for
the
second
time
disorganized
his
being
he
was
afraid
of
showing
weakness
once
more
conscious
as
he
was
that
his
will
was
weaker
already
an
old
man
you
can
never
have
seen
a
family
he
said
with
a
father
s
glance
at
his
wife
and
children
yes
an
old
man
echoed
the
stranger
frowning
slightly
fly
cried
the
general
but
he
did
not
dare
to
look
at
his
guest
our
compact
is
broken
i
shall
not
kill
you
no
i
will
never
be
purveyor
to
the
scaffold
but
go
out
you
make
us
i
know
that
said
the
other
patiently
there
is
not
a
spot
on
french
soil
where
i
can
set
foot
and
be
safe
but
if
man
s
justice
like
god
s
took
all
into
account
if
man
s
justice
deigned
to
inquire
which
was
the
monster
the
murderer
or
his
victim
then
i
might
hold
up
my
head
among
my
fellows
can
you
not
guess
that
other
crimes
preceded
that
blow
from
an
axe
i
constituted
myself
his
judge
and
executioner
i
stepped
in
where
man
s
justice
failed
that
was
my
crime
farewell
sir
bitter
though
you
have
made
your
hospitality
i
shall
not
forget
it
i
shall
always
bear
in
my
heart
a
feeling
of
gratitude
towards
one
man
in
the
world
and
you
are
that
man
but
i
could
wish
that
you
had
showed
yourself
more
generous
he
turned
towards
the
door
but
in
the
same
instant
helene
leaned
to
whisper
something
in
her
mother
s
ear
ah
at
the
cry
that
broke
from
his
wife
the
general
trembled
as
if
he
had
seen
moina
lying
dead
there
stood
helene
and
the
murderer
had
turned
instinctively
with
something
like
anxiety
about
these
folk
in
his
face
what
is
it
dear
asked
the
general
helene
wants
to
go
with
the
murderer
s
face
flushed
if
that
is
how
my
mother
understands
an
almost
involuntary
exclamation
helene
said
in
a
low
voice
i
will
fulfil
her
wishes
she
glanced
about
her
with
something
like
fierce
pride
then
the
girl
s
eyes
fell
and
she
stood
admirable
in
her
modesty
helene
did
you
go
up
to
the
room
where
yes
helene
and
his
voice
shook
with
a
convulsive
tremor
is
this
the
first
time
that
you
have
seen
this
man
yes
then
it
is
not
natural
that
you
should
intend
to
if
it
is
not
natural
father
at
any
rate
it
is
oh
child
said
the
marquise
lowering
her
voice
but
not
so
much
but
that
her
husband
could
hear
her
you
are
false
to
all
the
principles
of
honor
modesty
and
right
which
i
have
tried
to
cultivate
in
your
heart
if
until
this
fatal
hour
you
life
has
only
been
one
lie
there
is
nothing
to
regret
in
your
loss
it
can
hardly
be
the
moral
perfection
of
this
stranger
that
attracts
you
to
him
can
it
be
the
kind
of
power
that
commits
crime
i
have
too
good
an
opinion
of
you
to
suppose
that
oh
suppose
everything
madame
helene
said
coldly
but
though
her
force
of
character
sustained
this
ordeal
her
flashing
eyes
could
scarcely
hold
the
tears
that
filled
them
the
stranger
watching
her
guessed
the
mother
s
language
from
the
girl
s
tears
and
turned
his
eagle
glance
upon
the
marquise
an
irresistible
power
constrained
her
to
look
at
this
terrible
seducer
but
as
her
eyes
met
his
bright
glittering
gaze
she
felt
a
shiver
run
through
her
frame
such
a
shock
as
we
feel
at
the
sight
of
a
reptile
or
the
contact
of
a
leyden
jar
dear
she
cried
turning
to
her
husband
this
is
the
fiend
himself
he
can
divine
everything
the
general
rose
to
his
feet
and
went
to
the
bell
he
means
ruin
for
you
helene
said
to
the
murderer
the
stranger
smiled
took
one
forward
stride
grasped
the
general
s
arm
and
compelled
him
to
endure
a
steady
gaze
which
benumbed
the
soldier
s
brain
and
left
him
powerless
i
will
repay
you
now
for
your
hospitality
he
said
and
then
we
shall
be
quits
i
will
spare
you
the
shame
by
giving
myself
up
after
all
what
should
i
do
now
with
my
life
you
could
repent
answered
helene
and
her
glance
conveyed
such
hope
as
only
glows
in
a
young
girl
s
eyes
shall
never
said
the
murderer
in
a
sonorous
voice
as
he
raised
his
head
proudly
his
hands
are
stained
with
blood
the
father
said
i
will
wipe
it
away
she
answered
but
do
you
so
much
as
know
whether
he
cares
for
you
said
her
father
not
daring
now
to
look
at
the
stranger
the
murderer
came
up
a
little
nearer
some
light
within
seemed
to
glow
through
helene
s
beauty
grave
and
maidenly
though
it
was
coloring
and
bringing
into
relief
as
it
were
the
least
details
the
most
delicate
lines
in
her
face
the
stranger
with
that
terrible
face
still
blazing
in
his
eyes
gave
one
tender
glance
to
her
enchanting
loveliness
then
he
spoke
his
tones
revealing
how
deeply
he
had
been
moved
and
if
i
refuse
to
allow
this
sacrifice
of
yourself
and
so
discharge
my
debt
of
two
hours
of
existence
to
your
father
is
not
this
love
love
for
yourself
alone
then
do
you
too
reject
me
helene
s
cry
rang
painfully
through
the
hearts
of
all
who
heard
her
farewell
then
to
you
all
i
will
what
does
this
mean
asked
the
father
and
mother
helene
gave
her
mother
an
eloquent
glance
and
lowered
her
eyes
since
the
first
attempt
made
by
the
general
and
his
wife
to
contest
by
word
or
action
the
intruder
s
strange
presumption
to
the
right
of
staying
in
their
midst
from
their
first
experience
of
the
power
of
those
glittering
eyes
a
mysterious
torpor
had
crept
over
them
and
their
benumbed
faculties
struggled
in
vain
with
the
preternatural
influence
the
air
seemed
to
have
suddenly
grown
so
heavy
that
they
could
scarcely
breathe
yet
while
they
could
not
find
the
reason
of
this
feeling
of
oppression
a
voice
within
told
them
that
this
magnetic
presence
was
the
real
cause
of
their
helplessness
in
this
moral
agony
it
flashed
across
the
general
that
he
must
make
every
effort
to
overcome
this
influence
on
his
daughter
s
reeling
brain
he
caught
her
by
the
waist
and
drew
her
into
the
embrasure
of
a
window
as
far
as
possible
from
the
murderer
darling
he
murmured
if
some
wild
love
has
been
suddenly
born
in
your
heart
i
can
not
believe
that
you
have
not
the
strength
of
soul
to
quell
the
mad
impulse
your
innocent
life
your
pure
and
dutiful
soul
has
given
me
too
many
proofs
of
your
character
there
must
be
something
behind
all
this
well
this
heart
of
mine
is
full
of
indulgence
you
can
tell
everything
to
me
even
if
it
breaks
dear
child
i
can
be
silent
about
my
grief
and
keep
your
confession
a
secret
what
is
it
are
you
jealous
of
our
love
for
your
brothers
or
your
little
sister
is
it
some
love
trouble
are
you
unhappy
here
at
home
tell
me
about
it
tell
me
the
reasons
that
urge
you
to
leave
your
home
to
rob
it
of
its
greatest
charm
to
leave
your
mother
and
brothers
and
your
little
sister
i
am
in
love
with
no
one
father
and
jealous
of
no
one
not
even
of
your
friend
the
diplomatist
de
the
marquise
turned
pale
her
daughter
saw
this
and
stopped
short
sooner
or
later
i
must
live
under
some
man
s
protection
must
i
not
that
is
do
we
ever
know
she
went
on
the
human
being
to
whom
we
link
our
destinies
now
i
believe
in
this
oh
child
said
the
general
raising
his
voice
you
have
no
idea
of
all
the
misery
that
lies
in
store
for
i
am
thinking
of
what
a
life
groaned
the
father
a
woman
s
life
the
girl
murmured
you
have
a
great
knowledge
of
life
exclaimed
the
marquise
finding
speech
at
last
madame
my
answers
are
shaped
by
the
questions
but
if
you
desire
it
i
will
speak
more
speak
out
my
child
i
am
a
mother
and
daughter
looked
each
other
in
the
face
and
the
marquise
said
no
more
at
last
she
said
helene
if
you
have
any
reproaches
to
make
i
would
rather
bear
them
than
see
you
go
away
with
a
man
from
whom
the
whole
world
shrinks
in
then
you
see
yourself
madame
that
but
for
me
he
would
be
quite
that
will
do
madame
the
general
cried
we
have
but
one
daughter
left
to
us
now
and
he
looked
at
moina
who
slept
on
as
for
you
he
added
turning
to
helene
i
will
put
you
in
a
so
be
it
father
she
said
in
calm
despair
i
shall
die
there
you
are
answerable
to
god
alone
for
my
life
and
for
a
deep
sullen
silence
fell
after
these
words
the
during
this
strange
scene
so
utterly
at
variance
with
all
the
sentiments
of
ordinary
life
shunned
each
other
s
eyes
suddenly
the
marquis
happened
to
glance
at
his
pistols
he
caught
up
one
of
them
cocked
the
weapon
and
pointed
it
at
the
intruder
at
the
click
of
firearms
the
other
turned
his
piercing
gaze
full
upon
the
general
the
soldier
s
arm
slackened
indescribably
and
fell
heavily
to
his
side
the
pistol
dropped
to
the
floor
girl
you
are
free
said
he
exhausted
by
this
ghastly
struggle
kiss
your
mother
if
she
will
let
you
kiss
her
for
my
own
part
i
wish
never
to
see
nor
to
hear
of
you
helene
the
mother
began
only
think
of
the
wretched
life
before
a
sort
of
rattling
sound
came
from
the
intruder
s
deep
chest
all
eyes
were
turned
to
him
disdain
was
plainly
visible
in
his
face
the
general
rose
to
his
feet
my
hospitality
has
cost
me
dear
he
cried
before
you
came
you
had
taken
an
old
man
s
life
now
your
are
dealing
a
deadly
blow
at
a
whole
family
whatever
happens
there
must
be
unhappiness
in
this
and
if
your
daughter
is
happy
asked
the
other
gazing
steadily
at
the
general
the
father
made
a
superhuman
effort
for
if
she
is
happy
with
you
he
said
she
is
not
worth
helene
knelt
timidly
before
her
father
father
i
love
and
revere
you
she
said
whether
you
lavish
all
the
treasures
of
your
kindness
upon
me
or
make
me
feel
to
the
full
the
rigor
of
disgrace
but
i
entreat
that
your
last
words
of
farewell
shall
not
be
words
of
the
general
could
not
trust
himself
to
look
at
her
the
stranger
came
nearer
there
was
something
in
the
smile
that
he
gave
helene
angel
of
pity
you
that
do
not
shrink
in
horror
from
a
murderer
come
since
you
persist
in
your
resolution
of
intrusting
your
life
to
inconceivable
cried
her
father
the
marquise
then
looked
strangely
at
her
daughter
opened
her
arms
and
helene
fled
to
her
in
tears
farewell
she
said
farewell
mother
the
stranger
trembled
as
helene
undaunted
made
sign
to
him
that
she
was
ready
she
kissed
her
father
s
hand
and
as
if
performing
a
duty
gave
a
hasty
kiss
to
moina
and
little
abel
then
she
vanished
with
the
murderer
which
way
are
they
going
exclaimed
the
general
listening
to
the
footsteps
of
the
two
madame
he
turned
to
his
wife
i
think
i
must
be
dreaming
there
is
some
mystery
behind
all
this
i
do
not
understand
it
you
must
know
what
it
the
marquise
shivered
for
some
time
past
your
daughter
has
grown
extraordinarily
romantic
and
strangely
in
her
ideas
in
spite
of
the
pains
i
have
taken
to
combat
these
tendencies
in
her
character
this
will
not
do
began
the
general
but
fancying
that
he
heard
footsteps
in
the
garden
he
broke
off
to
fling
open
the
window
helene
he
shouted
his
voice
was
lost
in
the
darkness
like
a
vain
prophecy
the
utterance
of
that
name
to
which
there
should
never
be
answer
any
more
acted
like
a
counterspell
it
broke
the
charm
and
set
him
free
from
the
evil
enchantment
which
lay
upon
him
it
was
as
if
some
spirit
passed
over
his
face
he
now
saw
clearly
what
had
taken
place
and
cursed
his
incomprehensible
weakness
a
shiver
of
heat
rushed
from
his
heart
to
his
head
and
feet
he
became
himself
once
more
terrible
thirsting
for
revenge
he
raised
a
dreadful
cry
help
he
thundered
help
he
rushed
to
the
pulled
till
the
bells
rang
with
a
strange
clamor
of
din
pulled
till
the
cord
gave
way
the
whole
house
was
roused
with
a
start
still
shouting
he
flung
open
the
windows
that
looked
upon
the
street
called
for
the
police
caught
up
his
pistols
and
fired
them
off
to
hurry
the
mounted
patrols
the
servants
and
the
neighbors
the
dogs
barked
at
the
sound
of
their
master
s
voice
the
horses
neighed
and
stamped
in
their
stalls
the
quiet
night
was
suddenly
filled
with
hideous
uproar
the
general
on
the
staircase
in
pursuit
of
his
daughter
saw
the
scared
faces
of
the
servants
flocking
from
all
parts
of
the
house
my
daughter
he
shouted
helene
has
been
carried
off
search
the
garden
keep
a
lookout
on
the
road
open
the
gates
for
the
gendarmerie

with
the
strength
of
fury
he
snapped
the
chain
and
let
loose
the
great
helene
he
cried
helene
the
dog
sprang
out
like
a
lion
barking
furiously
and
dashed
into
the
garden
leaving
the
general
far
behind
a
troop
of
horses
came
along
the
road
at
a
gallop
and
he
flew
to
open
the
gates
himself
corporal
he
shouted
cut
off
the

of
de
mauny

they
have
gone
through

a

of

and
the

he
ordered
the
servants
form
a
chain
between
the
barrier
and
versailles
forward
every
man
of
you
he
caught
up
the
rifle
which
his
man
had
brought
out
and
dashed
into
the
garden
find
them
he
called
to
the
dog
an
ominous
baying
came
in
answer
from
the
distance
and
he
plunged
in
the
direction
from
which
the
growl
seemed
to
come
it
was
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
all
the
search
made
by
gendarmes
servants
and
neighbors
had
been
fruitless
and
the
dog
had
not
come
back
the
general
entered
the
salon
empty
now
for
him
though
the
other
three
children
were
there
he
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
looked
old
already
with
that
night
s
work
you
have
been
very
cold
to
your
daughter
he
said
turning
his
eyes
on
his
and
now
this
is
all
that
is
left
to
us
of
her
he
added
indicating
the
embroidery
frame
and
the
flower
just
begun
only
just
now
she
was
there
and
now
she
is
lost
lost
tears
followed
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
for
a
few
minutes
he
said
no
more
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
the
room
which
so
short
a
time
ago
had
made
a
setting
to
a
picture
of
the
sweetest
family
happiness
the
winter
dawn
was
struggling
with
the
dying
lamplight
the
tapers
burned
down
to
their
and
flared
out
everything
was
all
in
keeping
with
the
father
s
despair
this
must
be
destroyed
he
said
after
a
pause
pointing
to
the
i
shall
never
bear
to
see
anything
again
that
reminds
us
of
the
terrible
christmas
night
when
the
marquis
and
his
wife
lost
their
oldest
daughter
powerless
to
oppose
the
mysterious
influence
exercised
by
the
man
who
involuntarily
as
it
were
stole
helene
from
them
was
like
a
warning
sent
by
fate
the
marquis
was
ruined
by
the
failure
of
his
he
borrowed
money
on
his
wife
s
property
and
lost
it
in
the
endeavor
to
retrieve
his
fortunes
driven
to
desperate
expedients
he
left
france
six
years
went
by
his
family
seldom
had
news
of
him
but
a
few
days
before
spain
recognized
the
independence
of
the
american
republics
he
wrote
that
he
was
coming
home
so
one
fine
morning
it
happened
that
several
french
merchants
were
on
board
a
spanish
brig
that
lay
a
few
leagues
out
from
bordeaux
impatient
to
reach
their
native
land
again
with
wealth
acquired
by
long
years
of
toil
and
perilous
adventures
in
venezuela
and
mexico
one
of
the
passengers
a
man
who
looked
aged
by
trouble
rather
than
by
years
was
leaning
against
the
bulwark
netting
apparently
quite
unaffected
by
the
sight
to
be
seen
from
the
upper
deck
the
bright
day
the
sense
that
the
voyage
was
safely
over
had
brought
all
the
passengers
above
to
greet
their
land
the
larger
number
of
them
insisted
that
they
could
see
far
off
in
the
distance
the
houses
and
lighthouses
on
the
coast
of
gascony
and
the
tower
of
cardouan
melting
into
the
fantastic
erections
of
white
cloud
along
the
horizon
but
for
the
silver
fringe
that
played
about
their
bows
and
the
long
furrow
swiftly
effaced
in
their
wake
they
might
have
been
perfectly
still
in
so
calm
was
the
sea
the
sky
was
magically
clear
the
dark
blue
of
the
vault
above
paled
by
imperceptible
gradations
until
it
blended
with
the
bluish
water
a
gleaming
line
that
sparkled
like
stars
marking
the
dividing
line
of
sea
the
sunlight
caught
myriads
of
facets
over
the
wide
surface
of
the
ocean
in
such
a
sort
that
the
vast
plains
of
salt
water
looked
perhaps
more
full
of
light
than
the
fields
of
sky
the
brig
had
set
all
her
canvas
the
snowy
sails
swelled
by
the
strangely
soft
wind
the
labyrinth
of
cordage
and
the
yellow
flags
flying
at
the
masthead
all
stood
out
sharp
and
uncompromisingly
clear
against
the
vivid
background
of
space
sky
and
sea
there
was
nothing
to
alter
the
color
but
the
shadow
cast
by
the
great
cloudlike
sails
a
glorious
day
a
fair
wind
and
the
fatherland
in
sight
a
sea
like
a
the
melancholy
sound
of
the
ripples
a
fair
solitary
vessel
gliding
across
the
surface
of
the
water
like
a
woman
stealing
out
to
a
tryst
it
was
a
picture
full
of
harmony
that
mere
speck
full
of
movement
was
a
whence
the
soul
of
man
could
descry
the
immutable
vast
of
space
solitude
and
bustling
life
silence
and
sound
were
all
brought
together
in
strange
abrupt
contrast
you
could
not
tell
where
life
or
sound
or
silence
and
nothingness
lay
and
no
human
voice
broke
the
divine
spell
the
spanish
captain
the
crew
and
the
french
passengers
sat
or
stood
in
a
mood
of
devout
ecstasy
in
which
many
memories
blended
there
was
idleness
in
the
air
the
beaming
faces
told
of
complete
forgetfulness
of
past
hardships
the
men
were
rocked
on
the
fair
vessel
as
in
a
golden
dream
yet
from
time
to
time
the
elderly
passenger
leaning
over
the
bulwark
nettings
looked
with
something
like
uneasiness
at
the
horizon
distrust
of
the
ways
of
fate
could
be
read
in
his
whole
face
he
seemed
to
fear
that
he
should
not
reach
the
coast
of
france
in
time
this
was
the
marquis
fortune
had
not
been
deaf
to
his
despairing
cry
and
struggles
after
five
years
of
endeavor
and
painful
toil
he
was
a
wealthy
man
once
more
in
his
impatience
to
reach
his
home
again
and
to
bring
the
good
news
to
his
family
he
had
followed
the
example
set
by
some
french
merchants
in
havana
and
embarked
with
them
on
a
spanish
vessel
with
a
cargo
for
bordeaux
and
now
grown
tired
of
evil
forebodings
his
fancy
was
tracing
out
for
him
the
most
delicious
pictures
of
past
happiness
in
that
brown
line
of
land
he
seemed
to
see
his
wife
and
children
he
sat
in
his
place
by
the
fireside
they
were
crowding
about
him
he
felt
their
caresses
moina
had
grown
to
be
a
young
girl
she
was
beautiful
and
tall
and
striking
the
fancied
picture
had
grown
almost
real
when
the
tears
filled
his
eyes
and
to
hide
his
emotion
he
turned
his
face
towards
the
opposite
the
hazy
streak
that
meant
land
there
she
is
again
she
is
following
us
he
said
what
cried
the
spanish
captain
there
is
a
vessel
muttered
the
general
i
saw
her
yesterday
answered
captain
gomez
he
looked
at
his
interlocutor
as
if
to
ask
what
he
thought
then
he
added
in
the
general
s
ear
she
has
been
chasing
us
all
then
why
she
has
not
come
up
with
us
i
do
not
know
said
the
general
for
she
is
a
faster
sailor
than
your
damned
she
will
have
damaged
herself
sprung
a
leak
she
is
gaining
on
us
the
general
broke
in
she
is
a
columbian
privateer
the
captain
said
in
his
ear
and
we
are
still
six
leagues
from
land
and
the
wind
is
she
is
not
ahead
she
is
flying
as
if
she
knew
that
in
two
hours
time
her
prey
would
escape
her
what
audacity
audacity
cried
the
captain
oh
she
is
not
called
the
for
nothing
not
so
long
back
she
sank
a
spanish
frigate
that
carried
thirty
guns
this
is
the
one
thing
i
was
afraid
of
for
i
had
a
notion
that
she
was
cruising
about
somewhere
off
the
aha
he
added
after
a
pause
as
he
watched
the
sails
of
his
own
vessel
the
wind
is
rising
we
are
making
way
get
through
we
must
for
the
parisian
will
show
us
no
she
is
making
way
too
returned
the
general
the
was
scarce
three
leagues
away
by
this
time
and
although
the
conversation
between
the
marquis
and
captain
gomez
had
taken
place
apart
passengers
and
crew
attracted
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
sail
came
to
that
side
of
the
vessel
with
scarcely
an
exception
however
they
took
the
privateer
for
a
merchantman
and
watched
her
course
with
interest
till
all
at
once
a
sailor
shouted
with
some
energy
of
language
by
it
is
all
up
with
us
yonder
is
the
parisian
captain
at
that
terrible
name
dismay
and
a
panic
impossible
to
describe
spread
through
the
brig
the
spanish
captain
s
orders
put
energy
into
the
crew
for
a
while
and
in
his
resolute
determination
to
make
land
at
all
costs
he
set
all
the
studding
sails
and
crowded
on
every
stitch
of
canvas
on
board
but
all
this
was
not
the
work
of
a
moment
and
naturally
the
men
did
not
work
together
with
that
wonderful
unanimity
so
fascinating
to
watch
on
board
a
the
meanwhile
thanks
to
the
trimming
of
her
sails
flew
over
the
water
like
a
swallow
but
she
was
making
to
all
appearance
so
little
headway
that
the
unlucky
frenchmen
began
to
entertain
sweet
delusive
hopes
at
last
after
efforts
the
sprang
forward
gomez
himself
directing
the
shifting
of
the
sheets
with
voice
and
gesture
when
all
at
once
the
man
at
the
tiller
steering
at
random
purposely
no
doubt
swung
the
vessel
round
the
wind
striking
athwart
the
beam
the
sails
shivered
so
unexpectedly
that
the
brig
heeled
to
one
side
the
booms
were
carried
away
and
the
vessel
was
completely
out
of
hand
the
captain
s
face
grew
whiter
than
his
sails
with
unutterable
rage
he
sprang
upon
the
man
at
the
tiller
drove
his
dagger
at
him
in
such
blind
fury
that
he
missed
him
and
hurled
the
weapon
overboard
gomez
took
the
helm
himself
and
strove
to
right
the
gallant
vessel
tears
of
despair
rose
to
his
eyes
for
it
is
harder
to
lose
the
result
of
our
plans
through
treachery
than
to
face
imminent
death
but
the
more
the
captain
swore
the
less
the
men
worked
and
it
was
he
himself
who
fired
the
hoping
to
be
heard
on
shore
the
privateer
now
gaining
hopelessly
upon
them
replied
with
a
which
struck
the
water
ten
fathoms
away
from
the
thunder
of
heaven
cried
the
general
that
was
a
close
shave
they
must
have
guns
made
on
oh
when
that
one
yonder
speaks
look
you
you
have
to
hold
your
tongue
said
a
sailor
the
parisian
would
not
be
afraid
to
meet
an
english
it
is
all
over
with
us
the
captain
cried
in
desperation
he
had
pointed
his
telescope
landwards
and
saw
not
a
sign
from
the
shore
we
are
further
from
the
coast
than
i
why
do
you
despair
asked
the
general
all
your
passengers
are
frenchmen
they
have
chartered
your
vessel
the
privateer
is
a
parisian
you
say
well
and
good
run
up
the
white
flag
and
and
he
would
run
us
down
retorted
the
captain
he
can
be
anything
he
likes
when
he
has
a
mind
to
seize
on
a
rich
booty
oh
if
he
is
a
pirate
pirate
said
the
ferocious
looking
sailor
oh
he
always
has
the
law
on
his
side
or
he
knows
how
to
be
on
the
same
side
as
the
very
well
said
the
general
raising
his
eyes
let
us
make
up
our
minds
to
it
and
his
remaining
fortitude
was
still
sufficient
to
keep
back
the
tears
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
a
second
better
aimed
came
crashing
through
the
hull
of
the
heave
to
cried
the
captain
gloomily
the
sailor
who
had
commended
the
parisian
s
proclivities
showed
himself
a
clever
hand
at
working
a
ship
after
this
desperate
order
was
given
the
crew
waited
for
half
an
hour
in
an
agony
of
suspense
and
the
deepest
dismay
the
had
four
millions
of
piastres
on
board
the
whole
fortunes
of
the
five
passengers
and
the
general
s
eleven
hundred
thousand
francs
at
length
the
lay
not
ten
gunshots
away
so
that
those
on
the
could
look
into
the
muzzles
of
her
loaded
guns
the
vessel
seemed
to
be
borne
along
by
a
breeze
sent
by
the
devil
himself
but
the
eyes
of
an
expert
would
have
discovered
the
secret
of
her
speed
at
once
you
had
but
to
look
for
a
moment
at
the
rake
of
her
stern
her
long
narrow
keel
her
tall
masts
to
see
the
cut
of
her
sails
the
wonderful
lightness
of
her
rigging
and
the
ease
and
perfect
seamanship
with
which
her
crew
trimmed
her
sails
to
the
wind
everything
about
her
gave
the
impression
of
the
security
of
power
in
this
delicately
curved
inanimate
creature
swift
and
intelligent
as
a
greyhound
or
some
bird
of
prey
the
privateer
crew
stood
silent
ready
in
case
of
resistance
to
shatter
the
wretched
merchantman
which
luckily
for
her
remained
motionless
like
a
schoolboy
caught
in
flagrant
delict
by
a
master
we
have
guns
on
board
cried
the
general
clutching
the
spanish
captain
s
hand
but
the
courage
in
gomez
s
eyes
was
the
courage
of
despair
have
we
men
he
said
the
marquis
looked
round
at
the
crew
of
the
and
a
cold
chill
ran
through
him
there
stood
the
four
merchants
pale
and
quaking
for
fear
while
the
crew
gathered
about
some
of
their
own
number
who
appeared
to
be
arranging
to
go
over
in
a
body
to
the
enemy
they
watched
the
with
greed
and
curiosity
in
their
faces
the
captain
the
marquis
and
the
mate
exchanged
glances
they
were
the
only
three
who
had
a
thought
for
any
but
themselves
ah
captain
gomez
when
i
left
my
home
and
country
my
heart
was
half
dead
with
the
bitterness
of
parting
and
now
must
i
bid
it
once
more
when
i
am
bringing
back
happiness
and
ease
for
my
children
the
general
turned
his
head
away
towards
the
sea
with
tears
of
rage
in
his
eyes
and
saw
the
steersman
swimming
out
to
the
privateer
this
time
it
will
be
for
good
said
the
captain
by
way
of
answer
and
the
dazed
look
in
the
frenchman
s
eyes
startled
the
spaniard
by
this
time
the
two
vessels
were
almost
alongside
and
at
the
first
sight
of
the
enemy
s
crew
the
general
saw
that
gomez
s
gloomy
prophecy
was
only
too
true
the
three
men
at
each
gun
might
have
been
bronze
statues
standing
like
athletes
with
their
rugged
features
their
bare
sinewy
arms
men
whom
death
himself
had
scarcely
thrown
off
their
feet
the
rest
of
the
crew
well
armed
active
light
and
vigorous
also
stood
motionless
toil
had
hardened
and
the
sun
had
deeply
tanned
those
energetic
faces
their
eyes
glittered
like
sparks
of
fire
with
infernal
glee
and
courage
perfect
silence
on
the
upper
deck
now
black
with
men
bore
abundant
testimony
to
the
rigorous
discipline
and
strong
will
which
held
these
fiends
incarnate
in
check
the
captain
of
the
stood
with
folded
arms
at
the
foot
of
the
main
mast
he
carried
no
weapons
but
an
axe
lay
on
the
deck
beside
him
his
face
was
hidden
by
the
shadow
of
a
broad
felt
hat
the
men
looked
like
dogs
crouching
before
their
master
gunners
soldiers
and
ship
s
crew
turned
their
eyes
first
on
his
face
and
then
on
the
merchant
vessel
the
two
brigs
came
up
alongside
and
the
shock
of
contact
roused
the
privateer
captain
from
his
musings
he
spoke
a
word
in
the
ear
of
the
lieutenant
who
stood
beside
him
shouted
the
latter
and
the
grappled
the
with
miraculous
quickness
the
captain
of
the
privateer
gave
his
orders
in
a
low
voice
to
the
lieutenant
who
repeated
them
the
men
told
off
in
succession
for
each
duty
went
on
the
upper
deck
of
the
like
seminarists
going
to
mass
they
bound
crew
and
passengers
hand
and
foot
and
seized
the
booty
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
provisions
and
barrels
full
of
piastres
were
transferred
to
the
the
general
thought
that
he
must
be
dreaming
when
he
himself
likewise
bound
was
flung
down
on
a
bale
of
goods
as
if
he
had
been
part
of
the
cargo
a
brief
conference
took
place
between
the
captain
of
the
privateer
and
his
lieutenant
and
a
sailor
who
seemed
to
be
the
mate
of
the
vessel
then
the
mate
gave
a
whistle
and
the
men
jumped
on
board
the
and
completely
dismantled
her
with
the
nimble
dexterity
of
a
soldier
who
strips
a
dead
comrade
of
a
coveted
overcoat
and
shoes
it
is
all
over
with
us
said
the
spanish
captain
coolly
he
had
eyed
the
three
chiefs
during
their
confabulation
and
saw
that
the
sailors
were
proceeding
to
pull
his
vessel
to
pieces
why
so
asked
the
general
what
would
you
have
them
do
with
us
returned
the
spaniard
they
have
just
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
will
scarcely
sell
the
in
any
french
or
spanish
port
so
they
are
going
to
sink
her
to
be
rid
of
her
as
for
us
do
you
suppose
that
they
will
put
themselves
to
the
expense
of
feeding
us
when
they
don
t
know
what
port
they
are
to
put
into
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
the
captain
s
mouth
before
a
hideous
outcry
went
up
followed
by
a
dull
splashing
sound
as
several
bodies
were
thrown
overboard
he
turned
the
four
merchants
were
no
longer
to
be
seen
but
eight
gunners
were
still
standing
with
their
arms
raised
above
their
heads
he
shuddered
what
did
i
tell
you
the
spanish
captain
asked
coolly
the
marquis
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
spring
the
surface
of
the
sea
was
quite
smooth
again
he
could
not
so
much
as
see
the
place
where
his
unhappy
had
disappeared
by
this
time
they
were
sinking
down
bound
hand
and
foot
below
the
waves
if
indeed
the
fish
had
not
devoured
them
already
only
a
few
paces
away
the
treacherous
steersman
and
the
sailor
who
had
boasted
of
the
parisian
s
power
were
fraternizing
with
the
crew
of
the
and
pointing
out
those
among
their
own
number
who
in
their
opinion
were
worthy
to
join
the
crew
of
the
privateer
then
the
boys
tied
the
rest
together
by
the
feet
in
spite
of
frightful
oaths
it
was
soon
over
the
eight
gunners
seized
the
doomed
men
and
flung
them
overboard
without
more
ado
watching
the
different
ways
in
which
the
drowning
victims
met
their
death
their
contortions
their
last
agony
with
a
sort
of
malignant
curiosity
but
with
no
sign
of
amusement
surprise
or
pity
for
them
it
was
an
ordinary
event
to
which
seemingly
they
were
quite
accustomed
the
older
men
looked
instead
with
grim
set
smiles
at
the
casks
of
piastres
about
the
main
mast
the
general
and
captain
gomez
left
seated
on
a
bale
of
goods
consulted
each
other
with
hopeless
looks
they
were
in
a
sense
the
sole
survivors
of
the
for
the
seven
men
pointed
out
by
the
spies
were
transformed
amid
rejoicings
into
peruvians
what
atrocious
villains
the
general
cried
loyal
and
generous
indignation
silenced
prudence
and
pain
on
his
own
account
they
do
it
because
they
must
gomez
answered
coolly
if
you
came
across
one
of
those
fellows
you
would
run
him
through
the
body
would
you
not
the
lieutenant
now
came
up
to
the
spaniard
captain
said
he
the
parisian
has
heard
of
you
he
says
that
you
are
the
only
man
who
really
knows
the
passages
of
the
antilles
and
the
brazilian
coast
will
you
the
captain
cut
him
short
with
a
scornful
exclamation
i
shall
die
like
a
sailor
he
said
and
a
loyal
spaniard
and
a
christian
do
you
hear
heave
him
overboard
shouted
the
lieutenant
and
a
couple
of
gunners
seized
on
gomez
you
cowards
roared
the
general
seizing
hold
of
the
men
don
t
get
too
excited
old
boy
said
the
lieutenant
if
your
red
ribbon
has
made
some
impression
upon
our
captain
i
myself
do
not
care
a
rap
for
you
and
i
will
have
our
little
bit
of
talk
together
a
smothered
sound
with
no
accompanying
cry
told
the
general
that
the
gallant
captain
had
died
like
a
sailor
as
he
had
said
my
money
or
death
cried
the
marquis
in
a
fit
of
rage
terrible
to
see
ah
now
you
talk
sensibly
sneered
the
lieutenant
that
is
the
way
to
get
something
out
of
us
two
of
the
men
came
up
at
a
sign
and
hastened
to
bind
the
frenchmen
s
feet
but
with
boldness
he
snatched
the
lieutenant
s
cutlass
and
laid
about
him
like
a
cavalry
officer
who
knows
his
business
brigands
that
you
are
you
shall
not
chuck
one
of
napoleon
s
troopers
over
a
ship
s
side
like
an
oyster
at
the
sound
of
pistol
shots
fired
point
blank
at
the
frenchman
the
parisian
looked
round
from
his
occupation
of
superintending
the
transfer
of
the
rigging
from
the
he
came
up
behind
the
brave
general
seized
him
dragged
him
to
the
side
and
was
about
to
fling
him
over
with
no
more
concern
than
if
the
man
had
been
a
broken
spar
they
were
at
the
very
edge
when
the
general
looked
into
the
tawny
eyes
of
the
man
who
had
stolen
his
daughter
the
recognition
was
mutual
the
captain
of
the
privateer
his
arm
still
upraised
suddenly
swung
it
in
the
contrary
direction
as
if
his
victim
was
but
a
feather
weight
and
set
him
down
at
the
foot
of
the
main
mast
a
murmur
rose
on
the
upper
deck
but
the
captain
glanced
round
and
there
was
a
sudden
silence
this
is
helene
s
father
said
the
captain
in
a
clear
firm
voice
woe
to
any
one
who
meddles
with
him
a
hurrah
of
joy
went
up
at
the
words
a
shout
rising
to
the
sky
like
a
prayer
of
the
church
a
cry
like
the
first
high
notes
of
the
the
lads
swung
aloft
in
the
rigging
the
men
below
flung
up
their
caps
the
gunners
pounded
away
on
the
deck
there
was
a
general
thrill
of
excitement
an
outburst
of
oaths
yells
and
shrill
cries
in
voluble
chorus
the
men
cheered
like
fanatics
the
general
s
misgivings
deepened
and
he
grew
uneasy
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
some
horrible
mystery
in
such
wild
transports
my
daughter
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
where
is
my
daughter
for
all
answer
the
captain
of
the
privateer
gave
him
a
searching
glance
one
of
those
glances
which
throw
the
bravest
man
into
a
confusion
which
no
theory
can
explain
the
general
was
mute
not
a
little
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
crew
it
pleased
them
to
see
their
leader
exercise
the
strange
power
which
he
possessed
over
all
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
then
the
captain
led
the
way
down
a
staircase
and
flung
open
the
door
of
a
cabin
there
she
is
he
said
and
disappeared
leaving
the
general
in
a
stupor
of
bewilderment
at
the
scene
before
his
eyes
helene
cried
out
at
the
sight
of
him
and
sprang
up
from
the
sofa
on
which
she
was
lying
when
the
door
flew
open
so
changed
was
she
that
none
but
a
father
s
eyes
could
have
recognized
her
the
sun
of
the
tropics
had
brought
warmer
tones
into
the
once
pale
face
and
something
of
oriental
charm
with
that
wonderful
coloring
there
was
a
certain
grandeur
about
her
a
majestic
firmness
a
profound
sentiment
which
impresses
itself
upon
the
coarsest
nature
her
long
thick
hair
falling
in
large
curls
about
her
queenly
throat
gave
an
added
idea
of
power
to
the
proud
face
the
consciousness
of
that
power
shone
out
from
every
movement
every
line
of
helene
s
form
the
nostrils
were
dilated
slightly
with
the
joy
of
triumph
the
serene
happiness
of
her
life
had
left
its
plain
tokens
in
the
full
development
of
her
beauty
a
certain
indefinable
virginal
grace
met
in
her
with
the
pride
of
a
woman
who
is
loved
this
was
a
slave
and
a
queen
a
queen
who
would
fain
obey
that
she
might
reign
her
dress
was
magnificent
and
elegant
in
its
richness
india
muslin
was
the
sole
material
but
her
sofa
and
cushions
were
of
cashmere
a
persian
carpet
covered
the
floor
in
the
large
cabin
and
her
four
children
playing
at
her
feet
were
building
castles
of
gems
and
pearl
necklaces
and
jewels
of
price
the
air
was
full
of
the
scent
of
rare
flowers
in
sevres
porcelain
vases
painted
by
madame
jacotot
tiny
south
american
birds
like
living
rubies
sapphires
and
gold
hovered
among
the
mexican
jessamines
and
camellias
a
pianoforte
had
been
fitted
into
the
room
and
here
and
there
on
the
paneled
walls
covered
with
red
silk
hung
small
pictures
by
great
painters
a
by
hippolyte
schinner
beside
a
terburg
one
of
raphael
s
madonnas
scarcely
yielded
in
charm
to
a
sketch
by
gericault
while
a
gerard
dow
eclipsed
the
painters
of
the
empire
on
a
lacquered
table
stood
a
golden
plate
full
of
delicious
fruit
indeed
helene
might
have
been
the
sovereign
lady
of
some
great
country
and
this
cabin
of
hers
a
boudoir
in
which
her
crowned
lover
had
brought
together
all
earth
s
treasure
to
please
his
consort
the
children
gazed
with
bright
keen
eyes
at
their
grandfather
accustomed
as
they
were
to
a
life
of
battle
storm
and
tumult
they
recalled
the
roman
children
in
david
s
watching
the
fighting
and
bloodshed
with
curious
interest
what
is
it
possible
cried
helene
catching
her
father
s
arm
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
this
was
no
vision
helene
father
they
fell
into
each
other
s
arms
and
the
old
man
s
embrace
was
not
so
close
and
warm
as
helene
s
were
you
on
board
that
vessel
yes
he
answered
sadly
and
looking
at
the
little
ones
who
gathered
about
him
and
gazed
with
wide
open
eyes
i
was
about
to
perish
but
but
for
my
husband
she
broke
in
i
see
how
it
ah
cried
the
general
why
must
i
find
you
again
like
this
helene
after
all
the
many
tears
that
i
have
shed
must
i
still
groan
for
your
fate
and
why
she
asked
smiling
why
should
you
be
sorry
to
learn
that
i
am
the
happiest
woman
under
the
sun
he
cried
with
a
start
of
surprise
yes
happy
my
kind
father
and
she
caught
his
hands
in
hers
and
covered
them
with
kisses
and
pressed
them
to
her
throbbing
heart
her
caresses
and
a
something
in
the
carriage
of
her
head
were
interpreted
yet
more
plainly
by
the
joy
sparkling
in
her
eyes
and
how
is
this
he
asked
wondering
at
his
daughter
s
life
forgetful
now
of
everything
but
the
bright
glowing
face
before
him
listen
father
i
have
for
lover
husband
servant
and
master
one
whose
soul
is
as
great
as
the
boundless
sea
as
infinite
in
his
kindness
as
heaven
a
god
on
earth
never
during
these
seven
years
has
a
chance
look
or
word
or
gesture
jarred
in
the
divine
harmony
of
his
talk
his
love
his
caresses
his
eyes
have
never
met
mine
without
a
gleam
of
happiness
in
them
there
has
always
been
a
bright
smile
on
his
lips
for
me
on
deck
his
voice
rises
above
the
thunder
of
storms
and
the
tumult
of
battle
but
here
below
it
is
soft
and
melodious
as
rossini
s
music
for
he
has
rossini
s
music
sent
for
me
i
have
everything
that
woman
s
caprice
can
imagine
my
wishes
are
more
than
fulfilled
in
short
i
am
a
queen
on
the
seas
i
am
obeyed
here
as
perhaps
a
queen
may
be
ah
she
cried
interrupting
herself
did
i
say
happiness
is
no
word
to
express
such
bliss
as
mine
all
the
happiness
that
should
have
fallen
to
all
the
women
in
the
world
has
been
my
share
knowing
one
s
own
great
love
and
to
find
in
heart
an
infinite
love
in
which
a
woman
s
soul
is
lost
and
lost
for
ever
tell
me
is
this
happiness
i
have
lived
through
a
thousand
lives
even
now
here
i
am
alone
here
i
command
no
other
woman
has
set
foot
on
this
noble
vessel
and
victor
is
never
more
than
a
few
paces
distant
from
me
he
can
not
wander
further
from
me
than
from
stern
to
prow
she
added
with
a
shade
of
mischief
in
her
manner
seven
years
a
love
that
outlasts
seven
years
of
continual
joy
that
endures
all
the
tests
brought
by
all
the
moments
that
make
up
seven
years
is
this
love
oh
no
no
it
is
something
better
than
all
that
i
know
of
life
human
language
fails
to
express
the
bliss
of
a
sudden
torrent
of
tears
fell
from
her
burning
eyes
the
four
little
ones
raised
a
piteous
cry
at
this
and
flocked
like
chickens
about
their
mother
the
oldest
boy
struck
the
general
with
a
threatening
look
abel
darling
said
helene
i
am
crying
for
helene
took
him
on
her
knee
and
the
child
fondled
her
putting
his
arms
about
her
queenly
neck
as
a
lion
s
whelp
might
play
with
the
lioness
do
you
never
weary
of
your
life
asked
the
general
bewildered
by
his
daughter
s
enthusiastic
language
yes
she
said
sometimes
when
we
are
on
land
yet
even
then
i
have
never
parted
from
my
but
you
need
to
be
fond
of
music
and
balls
and
his
voice
is
music
for
me
and
for
fetes
i
devise
new
toilettes
for
him
to
see
when
he
likes
my
dress
it
is
as
if
all
the
world
admired
me
simply
for
that
reason
i
keep
the
diamonds
and
jewels
the
precious
things
the
flowers
and
masterpieces
of
art
that
he
heaps
upon
me
saying
helene
as
you
live
out
of
the
world
i
will
have
the
world
come
to
but
for
that
i
would
fling
them
all
but
there
are
others
on
board
wild
reckless
men
whose
passions
i
understand
father
she
said
smiling
do
not
fear
for
me
never
was
empress
encompassed
with
more
observance
than
i
the
men
are
very
superstitious
they
look
upon
me
as
a
sort
of
tutelary
genius
the
luck
of
the
vessel
but
is
their
god
they
worship
him
once
and
once
only
one
of
the
crew
showed
disrespect
mere
words
she
added
laughing
but
before
victor
knew
of
it
the
others
flung
the
offender
overboard
although
i
forgave
him
they
love
me
as
their
good
angel
i
nurse
them
when
they
are
ill
several
times
i
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
save
a
life
by
constant
care
such
as
a
woman
can
give
poor
fellows
they
are
giants
but
they
are
children
at
the
same
and
when
there
is
fighting
overhead
i
am
used
to
it
now
i
quaked
for
fear
during
the
first
engagement
but
never
i
am
used
to
such
peril
and
i
am
your
daughter
she
said
i
love
but
how
if
he
should
fall
i
should
die
with
and
your
children
they
are
children
of
the
sea
and
of
danger
they
share
the
life
of
their
parents
we
have
but
one
life
and
we
do
not
flinch
from
it
we
have
but
one
life
our
names
are
written
on
the
same
page
of
the
book
of
fate
one
skiff
bears
us
and
our
fortunes
and
we
know
do
you
so
love
him
that
he
is
more
to
you
than
all
beside
all
beside
echoed
she
let
us
leave
that
mystery
alone
yet
stay
there
is
this
dear
little
one
well
this
too
is
and
straining
abel
to
her
in
a
tight
clasp
she
set
eager
kisses
on
his
cheeks
and
hair
but
i
can
never
forget
that
he
has
just
drowned
nine
men
exclaimed
the
general
there
was
no
help
for
it
doubtless
she
said
for
he
is
generous
and
humane
he
sheds
as
little
blood
as
may
be
and
only
in
the
interests
of
the
little
world
which
he
defends
and
the
sacred
cause
for
which
he
is
fighting
talk
to
him
about
anything
that
seems
to
you
to
be
wrong
and
he
will
convince
you
you
will
there
was
that
crime
of
his
muttered
the
general
to
himself
but
how
if
that
crime
was
a
virtue
she
asked
with
cold
dignity
how
if
man
s
justice
had
failed
to
avenge
a
great
wrong
but
a
private
revenge
exclaimed
her
father
but
what
is
hell
she
cried
but
a
revenge
through
all
eternity
for
the
wrong
done
in
a
little
day
ah
you
are
lost
he
has
bewitched
and
perverted
you
you
are
talking
stay
with
us
one
day
father
and
if
you
will
but
listen
to
him
and
see
him
you
will
love
helene
france
lies
only
a
few
leagues
away
he
said
gravely
helene
trembled
then
she
went
to
the
porthole
and
pointed
to
the
savannas
of
green
water
spreading
far
and
wide
there
lies
my
country
she
said
tapping
the
carpet
with
her
foot
but
are
you
not
coming
with
me
to
see
your
mother
and
your
sister
and
brothers
oh
yes
she
cried
with
tears
in
her
voice
if
is
willing
if
he
will
come
with
so
the
general
said
sternly
you
have
neither
country
nor
kin
now
helene
i
am
his
wife
she
answered
proudly
and
there
was
something
very
noble
in
her
tone
this
is
the
first
happiness
in
seven
years
that
has
not
come
to
me
through
him
she
said
then
as
she
caught
her
father
s
hand
and
kissed
it
and
this
is
the
first
word
of
reproach
that
i
have
and
your
conscience
my
conscience
he
is
my
conscience
she
cried
trembling
from
head
to
foot
here
he
is
even
in
the
thick
of
a
fight
i
can
tell
his
footstep
among
all
the
others
on
deck
she
cried
a
sudden
crimson
flushed
her
cheeks
and
glowed
in
her
features
her
eyes
lighted
up
her
complexion
changed
to
velvet
whiteness
there
was
joy
and
love
in
every
fibre
in
the
blue
veins
in
the
unconscious
trembling
of
her
whole
frame
that
quiver
of
the
sensitive
plant
softened
the
general
it
was
as
she
had
said
the
captain
came
in
sat
down
in
an
took
up
his
oldest
boy
and
began
to
play
with
him
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
for
the
general
s
deep
musing
had
grown
vague
and
dreamy
and
the
daintily
furnished
cabin
and
the
playing
children
seemed
like
a
nest
of
halcyons
floating
on
the
waves
between
sky
and
sea
safe
in
the
protection
of
this
man
who
steered
his
way
amid
the
perils
of
war
and
tempest
as
other
heads
of
household
guide
those
in
their
care
among
the
hazards
of
common
life
he
gazed
admiringly
at
helene
a
dreamlike
vision
of
some
sea
goddess
gracious
in
her
loveliness
rich
in
happiness
all
the
treasures
about
her
grown
poor
in
comparison
with
the
wealth
of
her
nature
paling
before
the
brightness
of
her
eyes
the
indefinable
romance
expressed
in
her
and
her
surroundings
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
took
the
general
by
surprise
the
ideas
of
ordinary
life
were
thrown
into
confusion
by
this
lofty
passion
and
reasoning
chill
and
narrow
social
conventions
faded
away
before
this
picture
all
these
things
the
old
soldier
felt
and
saw
no
less
how
impossible
it
was
that
his
daughter
should
give
up
so
wide
a
life
a
life
so
variously
rich
filled
to
the
full
with
such
passionate
love
and
helene
had
tasted
danger
without
shrinking
how
could
she
return
to
the
pretty
stage
the
superficial
circumscribed
life
of
society
it
was
the
captain
who
broke
the
silence
at
last
am
i
in
the
way
he
asked
looking
at
his
wife
no
said
the
general
answering
for
her
helene
has
told
me
all
i
see
that
she
is
lost
to
us
no
the
captain
put
in
quickly
in
a
few
years
time
the
statute
of
limitations
will
allow
me
to
go
back
to
france
when
the
conscience
is
clear
and
a
man
has
broken
the
law
in
obedience
to
he
stopped
short
as
if
scorning
to
justify
himself
how
can
you
commit
new
murders
such
as
i
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
without
remorse
we
had
no
provisions
the
privateer
captain
retorted
calmly
but
if
you
had
set
the
men
ashore
they
would
have
given
the
alarm
and
sent
a
after
us
and
we
should
never
have
seen
chili
before
france
would
have
given
warning
to
the
spanish
admiralty
began
the
general
but
france
might
take
it
amiss
that
a
man
with
a
warrant
still
out
against
him
should
seize
a
brig
chartered
by
bordeaux
merchants
and
for
that
matter
have
you
never
fired
a
shot
or
so
too
many
in
battle
the
general
shrank
under
the
other
s
eyes
he
said
no
more
and
his
daughter
looked
at
him
half
sadly
half
triumphant
general
the
privateer
continued
in
a
deep
voice
i
have
made
it
a
rule
to
abstract
nothing
from
booty
but
even
so
my
share
will
be
beyond
a
doubt
far
larger
than
your
fortune
permit
me
to
return
it
to
you
in
another
form
he
drew
a
pile
of
banknotes
from
the
piano
and
without
counting
the
packets
handed
a
million
of
francs
to
the
marquis
you
can
understand
he
said
that
i
can
not
spend
my
time
in
watching
vessels
pass
by
to
bordeaux
so
unless
the
dangers
of
this
bohemian
life
of
ours
have
some
attraction
for
you
unless
you
care
to
see
south
america
and
the
nights
of
the
tropics
and
a
bit
of
fighting
now
and
again
for
the
pleasure
of
helping
to
win
a
triumph
for
a
young
nation
or
for
the
name
of
simon
bolivar
we
must
part
the
long
boat
manned
with
a
trustworthy
crew
is
ready
for
you
and
now
let
us
hope
that
our
third
meeting
will
be
completely
victor
said
helene
in
a
dissatisfied
tone
i
should
like
to
see
a
little
more
of
my
ten
minutes
more
or
less
may
bring
up
a
french
frigate
however
so
be
it
we
shall
have
a
little
fun
the
men
find
things
oh
father
go
cried
helene
and
take
these
keepsakes
from
me
to
my
sister
and
brothers
and
mother
she
added
she
caught
up
a
handful
of
jewels
and
precious
stones
folded
them
in
an
indian
shawl
and
timidly
held
it
out
but
what
shall
i
say
to
them
from
you
asked
he
her
hesitation
on
the
word
mother
seemed
to
have
struck
him
oh
can
you
doubt
me
i
pray
for
their
happiness
every
helene
he
began
as
he
watched
her
closely
how
if
we
should
not
meet
again
shall
i
never
know
why
you
left
us
that
secret
is
not
mine
she
answered
gravely
even
if
i
had
the
right
to
tell
it
perhaps
i
should
not
for
ten
years
i
was
more
miserable
than
words
can
say
she
broke
off
and
gave
her
father
the
presents
for
her
family
the
general
had
acquired
tolerably
easy
views
as
to
booty
in
the
course
of
a
soldier
s
career
so
he
took
helene
s
gifts
and
comforted
himself
with
the
reflection
that
the
parisian
captain
was
sure
to
wage
war
against
the
spaniards
as
an
honorable
man
under
the
influence
of
helene
s
pure
and
nature
his
passion
for
courage
carried
all
before
it
it
was
ridiculous
he
thought
to
be
squeamish
in
the
matter
so
he
shook
hands
cordially
with
his
captor
and
kissed
helene
his
only
daughter
with
a
soldier
s
expansiveness
letting
fall
a
tear
on
the
face
with
the
proud
strong
look
that
once
he
had
loved
to
see
the
parisian
deeply
moved
brought
the
children
for
his
blessing
the
parting
was
over
the
last
was
a
long
farewell
look
with
something
of
tender
regret
on
either
side
a
strange
sight
to
seaward
met
the
general
s
eyes
the
was
blazing
like
a
huge
bonfire
the
men
told
off
to
sink
the
spanish
brig
had
found
a
cargo
of
rum
on
board
and
as
the
was
already
amply
supplied
had
lighted
a
floating
bowl
of
punch
on
the
high
seas
by
way
of
a
joke
a
pleasantry
pardonable
enough
in
sailors
who
hail
any
chance
excitement
as
a
relief
from
the
apparent
monotony
of
life
at
sea
as
the
general
went
over
the
side
into
the
of
the
manned
by
six
vigorous
rowers
he
could
not
help
looking
at
the
burning
vessel
as
well
as
at
the
daughter
who
stood
by
her
husband
s
side
on
the
stern
of
the
he
saw
helene
s
white
dress
flutter
like
one
more
sail
in
the
breeze
he
saw
the
tall
noble
figure
against
a
background
of
sea
queenly
still
even
in
the
presence
of
ocean
and
so
many
memories
crowded
up
in
his
mind
that
with
a
soldier
s
recklessness
of
life
he
forgot
that
he
was
being
borne
over
the
grave
of
the
brave
gomez
a
vast
column
of
smoke
rising
spread
like
a
brown
cloud
pierced
here
and
there
by
fantastic
shafts
of
sunlight
it
was
a
second
sky
a
murky
dome
reflecting
the
glow
of
the
fire
as
if
the
under
surface
had
been
burnished
but
above
it
soared
the
unchanging
blue
of
the
firmament
a
thousand
times
fairer
for
the
contrast
the
strange
hues
of
the
smoke
cloud
black
and
red
tawny
and
pale
by
turns
blurred
and
blending
into
each
other
shrouded
the
burning
vessel
as
it
flared
crackled
and
groaned
the
hissing
tongues
of
flame
licked
up
the
rigging
and
flashed
across
the
hull
like
a
rumor
of
riot
flashing
along
the
streets
of
a
city
the
burning
rum
sent
up
blue
flitting
lights
some
sea
god
might
have
been
stirring
the
furious
liquor
as
a
student
stirs
the
joyous
flames
of
punch
in
an
orgy
but
in
the
overpowering
sunlight
jealous
of
the
insolent
blaze
the
colors
were
scarcely
visible
and
the
smoke
was
but
a
film
fluttering
like
a
thin
scarf
in
the
noonday
torrent
of
light
and
heat
the
made
the
most
of
the
little
wind
she
could
gain
to
fly
on
her
new
course
swaying
first
to
one
side
then
to
the
other
like
a
stag
beetle
on
the
wing
the
fair
vessel
beat
to
windward
on
her
zigzag
flight
to
the
south
sometimes
she
was
hidden
from
sight
by
the
straight
column
of
smoke
that
flung
fantastic
shadows
across
the
water
then
gracefully
she
shot
out
clear
of
it
and
helene
catching
sight
of
her
father
waved
her
handkerchief
for
yet
one
more
farewell
greeting
a
few
more
minutes
and
the
went
down
with
a
bubbling
turmoil
at
once
effaced
by
the
ocean
nothing
of
all
that
had
been
was
left
but
a
smoke
cloud
hanging
in
the
breeze
the
was
far
away
the
had
almost
reached
land
the
cloud
came
between
the
frail
skiff
and
the
brig
and
it
was
through
a
break
in
the
swaying
smoke
that
the
general
caught
the
last
glimpse
of
helene
a
prophetic
vision
her
dress
and
her
white
handkerchief
stood
out
against
the
murky
background
then
the
brig
was
not
even
visible
between
the
green
water
and
the
blue
sky
and
helene
was
nothing
but
an
imperceptible
speck
a
faint
graceful
line
an
angel
in
heaven
a
mental
image
a
memory
the
marquis
had
retrieved
his
fortunes
when
he
died
worn
out
with
toil
a
few
months
after
his
death
in
the
marquise
was
obliged
to
take
moina
to
a
in
the
pyrenees
for
the
capricious
child
had
a
wish
to
see
the
beautiful
mountain
scenery
they
left
the
baths
and
the
following
tragical
incident
occurred
on
their
way
home
dear
me
mother
said
moina
it
was
very
foolish
of
us
not
to
stay
among
the
mountains
a
few
days
longer
it
was
much
nicer
there
did
you
hear
that
horrid
child
moaning
all
night
and
that
wretched
woman
gabbling
away
in
patois
no
doubt
for
i
could
not
understand
a
single
word
she
said
what
kind
of
people
can
they
have
put
in
the
next
room
to
ours
this
is
one
of
the
horridest
nights
i
have
ever
spent
in
my
i
heard
nothing
said
the
marquise
but
i
will
see
the
landlady
darling
and
engage
the
next
room
and
then
we
shall
have
the
whole
suite
of
rooms
to
ourselves
and
there
will
be
no
more
noise
how
do
you
feel
this
morning
are
you
tired
as
she
spoke
the
marquise
rose
and
went
to
moina
s
bedside
let
us
see
she
said
feeling
for
the
girl
s
hand
oh
let
me
alone
mother
said
moina
your
fingers
are
she
turned
her
head
round
on
the
pillow
as
she
spoke
pettishly
but
with
such
engaging
grace
that
a
mother
could
scarcely
have
taken
it
amiss
just
then
a
wailing
cry
echoed
through
the
next
room
a
faint
prolonged
cry
that
must
surely
have
gone
to
the
heart
of
any
woman
who
heard
it
why
if
you
heard
all
night
long
why
did
you
not
wake
me
we
should
have
a
deeper
moan
than
any
that
had
gone
before
it
interrupted
the
marquise
some
one
is
dying
there
she
cried
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
send
pauline
to
me
called
moina
i
shall
get
up
and
the
marquise
hastened
downstairs
and
found
the
landlady
in
the
courtyard
with
a
little
group
about
her
apparently
much
interested
in
something
that
she
was
telling
them
madame
you
have
put
some
one
in
the
next
room
who
seems
to
be
very
ill
indeed
oh
don
t
talk
to
me
about
it
cried
the
mistress
of
the
house
i
have
just
sent
some
one
for
the
mayor
just
imagine
it
it
is
a
woman
a
poor
unfortunate
creature
that
came
here
last
night
on
foot
she
comes
from
spain
she
has
no
passport
and
no
money
she
was
carrying
her
baby
on
her
back
and
the
child
was
dying
i
could
not
refuse
to
take
her
in
i
went
up
to
see
her
this
morning
myself
for
when
she
turned
up
yesterday
it
made
me
feel
dreadfully
bad
to
look
at
her
poor
soul
she
and
the
child
were
lying
in
bed
and
both
of
them
at
death
s
door
madame
says
she
pulling
a
gold
ring
off
her
finger
this
is
all
that
i
have
left
take
it
in
payment
it
will
be
enough
i
shall
not
stay
here
long
poor
little
one
we
shall
die
together
soon
she
said
looking
at
the
child
i
took
her
ring
and
i
asked
her
who
she
was
but
she
never
would
tell
me
her
name
i
have
just
sent
for
the
doctor
and
le
why
you
must
do
all
that
can
be
done
for
her
cried
the
marquise
good
heavens
perhaps
it
is
not
too
late
i
will
pay
for
everything
that
is
necessary
ah
my
lady
she
looks
to
me
uncommonly
proud
and
i
don
t
know
that
she
would
allow
i
will
go
to
see
her
at
the
marquise
went
up
forthwith
to
the
stranger
s
room
without
thinking
of
the
shock
that
the
sight
of
her
widow
s
weeds
might
give
to
a
woman
who
was
said
to
be
dying
at
the
sight
of
that
dying
woman
the
marquise
turned
pale
in
spite
of
the
changes
wrought
by
fearful
suffering
in
helene
s
beautiful
face
she
recognized
her
eldest
daughter
but
helene
when
she
saw
a
woman
dressed
in
black
sat
upright
in
bed
with
a
shriek
of
horror
then
she
sank
back
she
knew
her
mother
my
daughter
said
mme
d
aiglemont
what
is
to
be
done
pauline
moina
nothing
now
for
me
said
helene
faintly
i
had
hoped
to
see
my
father
once
more
but
your
mourning
she
broke
off
clutched
her
child
to
her
heart
as
if
to
give
it
warmth
and
kissed
its
forehead
then
she
turned
her
eyes
on
her
mother
and
the
marquise
met
the
old
reproach
in
them
tempered
with
forgiveness
it
is
true
but
still
reproach
she
saw
it
and
would
not
see
it
she

that

was
the
child
conceived
amid
tears
and
despair
the
child
of
duty
the
cause
of
one
of
the
greatest
sorrows
in
her
life
she
stole
to
her
eldest

side
remembering
nothing
but
that
helene
was
her
firstborn
the
child
who
had
taught
her
to
know
the
joys
of

the
mother

eyes
were
full
of

my

cried
with

about

silent
her

just
drawn
its
last
breath
on
her
breast
moina
came
into

room
with

her

and
the
landlady
and
the

the

was
holding
her

in
both
of

gazing
at

in
despair
but
the
widowed
woman
who
had
escaped
shipwreck
with
but
one
of
all
her
fair
band
of

spoke
in
a
voice
that
was
dreadful
to
hear
all
this
is
your
work
she
said
if

been
for

let

with

effort
i

oh
why

not
die
as

of

when

there

no

outside

sank
till
her

little
one
in

agony
she
strained
her

to
her
breast
and
died
your

moina
said
mme

bursting
into
tears
when
she
reached
her

your
sister
meant
no
doubt
to
tell
you
that
a
girl
will
never
find
happiness
in
a
romantic
life
in
living
as
nobody
else
does
and
above
all
things
far
away
from
her
vi
the
old
age
of
a
guilty
mother
it
was
one
of
the
earliest
june
days
of
the
year
a
lady
of
fifty
or
thereabouts
for
she
looked
older
than
her
actual
age
was
pacing
up
and
down
one
of
the
sunny
paths
in
the
garden
of
a
great
mansion
in
the
rue
plument
in
paris
it
was
noon
the
lady
took
two
or
three
turns
along
the
gently
winding
garden
walk
careful
never
to
lose
sight
of
a
certain
row
of
windows
to
which
she
seemed
to
give
her
whole
attention
then
she
sat
down
on
a
bench
a
piece
of
elegant
made
of
branches
with
the
bark
left
on
the
wood
from
the
place
where
she
sat
she
could
look
through
the
garden
railings
along
the
inner
boulevards
to
the
wonderful
dome
of
the
invalides
rising
above
the
crests
of
a
forest
of
and
see
the
less
striking
view
of
her
own
grounds
terminating
in
the
gray
stone
front
of
one
of
the
finest
hotels
in
the
faubourg
silence
lay
over
the
neighboring
gardens
and
the
boulevards
stretching
away
to
the
invalides
day
scarcely
begins
at
noon
in
that
aristocratic
quarter
and
masters
and
servants
are
all
alike
asleep
or
just
awakening
unless
some
young
lady
takes
it
into
her
head
to
go
for
an
early
ride
or
a
diplomatist
rises
betimes
to
redraft
a
protocol
the
elderly
lady
stirring
abroad
at
that
hour
was
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
the
mother
of
mme
de
to
whom
the
great
house
belonged
the
marquise
had
made
over
the
mansion
and
almost
her
whole
fortune
to
her
daughter
reserving
only
an
annuity
for
herself
the
comtesse
moina
de
was
mme
d
aiglemont
s
youngest
child
the
marquise
had
made
every
sacrifice
to
marry
her
daughter
to
the
eldest
son
of
one
of
the
greatest
houses
of
france
and
this
was
only
what
might
have
been
expected
for
the
lady
had
lost
her
sons
first
one
and
then
the
other
gustave
marquis
d
aiglemont
had
died
of
the
cholera
abel
the
second
had
fallen
in
algeria
gustave
had
left
a
widow
and
children
but
the
dowager
s
affection
for
her
sons
had
been
only
moderately
warm
and
for
the
next
generation
it
was
decidedly
tepid
she
was
always
civil
to
her
but
her
feeling
towards
the
young
marquise
was
the
distinctly
conventional
affection
which
good
taste
and
good
manners
require
us
to
feel
for
our
relatives
the
fortunes
of
her
dead
children
having
been
settled
she
could
devote
her
savings
and
her
own
property
to
her
darling
moina
moina
beautiful
and
fascinating
from
childhood
was
mme
d
aiglemont
s
favorite
loved
beyond
all
the
others
with
an
instinctive
or
involuntary
love
a
fatal
drawing
of
the
heart
which
sometimes
seems
inexplicable
sometimes
and
to
a
close
observer
only
too
easy
to
explain
her
darling
s
pretty
face
the
sound
of
moina
s
voice
her
ways
her
manner
her
looks
and
gestures
roused
all
the
deepest
emotions
that
can
stir
a
mother
s
heart
with
trouble
rapture
or
delight
the
springs
of
the
marquise
s
life
of
yesterday
and
lay
in
that
young
heart
moina
with
better
fortune
had
survived
four
older
children
as
a
matter
of
fact
mme
d
aiglemont
had
lost
her
eldest
daughter
a
charming
girl
in
a
most
unfortunate
manner
said
gossip
nobody
knew
exactly
what
became
of
her
and
then
she
lost
a
little
boy
of
five
by
a
dreadful
accident
the
child
of
her
affections
had
however
been
spared
to
her
and
doubtless
the
marquise
saw
the
will
of
heaven
in
that
fact
for
those
who
had
died
she
kept
but
very
shadowy
recollections
in
some
corner
of
her
heart
her
memories
of
her
dead
children
were
like
the
headstones
on
a
battlefield
you
can
scarcely
see
them
for
the
flowers
that
have
sprung
up
about
them
since
of
course
if
the
world
had
chosen
it
might
have
said
some
hard
truths
about
the
marquise
might
have
taken
her
to
task
for
shallowness
and
an
overweening
preference
for
one
child
at
the
expense
of
the
rest
but
the
world
of
paris
is
swept
along
by
the
full
flood
of
new
events
new
ideas
and
new
fashions
and
it
was
inevitable
the
mme
d
aiglemont
should
be
in
some
sort
allowed
to
drop
out
of
sight
so
nobody
thought
of
blaming
her
for
coldness
or
neglect
which
concerned
no
one
whereas
her
quick
apprehensive
tenderness
for
moina
was
found
highly
interesting
by
not
a
few
who
respected
it
as
a
sort
of
superstition
besides
the
marquise
scarcely
went
into
society
at
all
and
the
few
families
who
knew
her
thought
of
her
as
a
kindly
gentle
indulgent
woman
wholly
devoted
to
her
family
what
but
a
curiosity
keen
indeed
would
seek
to
pry
beneath
the
surface
with
which
the
world
is
quite
satisfied
and
what
would
we
not
pardon
to
old
people
if
only
they
will
efface
themselves
like
shadows
and
consent
to
be
regarded
as
memories
and
nothing
more
indeed
mme
d
aiglemont
became
a
kind
of
example
complacently
held
up
by
the
younger
generation
to
fathers
of
families
and
frequently
cited
to
she
had
made
over
her
property
to
moina
in
her
own
lifetime
the
young
countess
happiness
was
enough
for
her
she
only
lived
in
her
daughter
if
some
cautious
old
person
or
morose
uncle
here
and
there
condemned
the
course
with
perhaps
mme
d
aiglemont
may
be
sorry
some
day
that
she
gave
up
her
fortune
to
her
daughter
she
may
be
sure
of
moina
but
how
can
she
be
equally
sure
of
her
these
prophets
were
cried
down
on
all
sides
and
from
all
sides
a
chorus
of
praise
went
up
for
moina
it
ought
to
be
said
in
justice
to
mme
de
that
her
mother
can
not
feel
the
slightest
difference
remarked
a
young
married
woman
mme
d
aiglemont
is
admirably
well
housed
she
has
a
carriage
at
her
disposal
and
can
go
everywhere
just
as
she
used
to
do
except
to
the
italiens
remarked
a
low
voice
this
was
an
elderly
parasite
one
of
those
persons
who
show
their
independence
as
they
think
by
riddling
their
friends
with
epigrams
except
to
the
italiens
and
if
the
dowager
cares
for
anything
on
this
earth
but
her
daughter
it
is
music
such
a
good
performer
she
was
in
her
time
but
the
countess
box
is
always
full
of
young
butterflies
and
the
countess
mother
would
be
in
the
way
the
young
lady
is
talked
about
already
as
a
great
flirt
so
the
poor
mother
never
goes
to
the
mme
de
has
delightful
at
homes
for
her
mother
said
a
rosebud
all
paris
goes
to
her
salon
and
no
one
pays
any
attention
to
the
marquise
returned
the
parasite
the
fact
is
that
mme
d
aiglemont
is
never
alone
remarked
a
coxcomb
siding
with
the
young
women
in
the
morning
the
old
observer
continued
in
a
discreet
voice
in
the
morning
dear
moina
is
asleep
at
four
o
clock
dear
moina
drives
in
the
bois
in
the
evening
dear
moina
goes
to
a
ball
or
to
the
still
it
is
certainly
true
that
mme
d
aiglemont
has
the
privilege
of
seeing
her
dear
daughter
while
she
dresses
and
again
at
dinner
if
dear
moina
happens
to
dine
with
her
mother
not
a
week
ago
sir
continued
the
elderly
person
laying
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
shy
tutor
a
new
arrival
in
the
house
not
a
week
ago
i
saw
the
poor
mother
solitary
and
sad
by
her
own
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
the
marquise
looked
up
smiling
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
she
had
been
i
was
thinking
that
it
is
a
strange
thing
that
i
should
be
left
alone
when
i
have
had
five
children
she
said
but
that
is
our
destiny
and
besides
i
am
happy
when
i
know
that
moina
is
enjoying
she
could
say
that
to
me
for
i
knew
her
husband
when
he
was
alive
a
poor
stick
he
was
and
uncommonly
lucky
to
have
such
a
wife
it
was
certainly
owing
to
her
that
he
was
made
a
peer
of
france
and
had
a
place
at
court
under
charles
yet
such
mistaken
ideas
get
about
in
social
gossip
and
such
mischief
is
done
by
it
that
the
historian
of
manners
is
bound
to
exercise
his
discretion
and
weigh
the
assertions
so
recklessly
made
after
all
who
is
to
say
that
either
mother
or
daughter
was
right
or
wrong
there
is
but
one
who
can
read
and
judge
their
hearts
and
how
often
does
he
wreak
his
vengeance
in
the
family
circle
using
throughout
all
time
children
as
his
instruments
against
their
mothers
and
fathers
against
their
sons
raising
up
peoples
against
kings
and
princes
against
peoples
sowing
strife
and
division
everywhere
and
in
the
world
of
ideas
are
not
opinions
and
feelings
expelled
by
new
feelings
and
opinions
much
as
withered
leaves
are
thrust
forth
by
the
young
in
the
spring
all
in
obedience
to
the
immutable
scheme
all
to
some
end
which
god
alone
knows
yet
surely
all
things
proceed
to
him
or
rather
to
him
all
things
return
such
thoughts
of
religion
the
natural
thoughts
of
age
floated
up
now
and
again
on
the
current
of
mme
d
aiglemont
s
thoughts
they
were
always
dimly
present
in
her
mind
but
sometimes
they
shone
out
clearly
sometimes
they
were
carried
under
like
flowers
tossed
on
the
vexed
surface
of
a
stormy
sea
she
sat
on
a
tired
with
walking
exhausted
with
much
thinking
with
the
long
thoughts
in
which
a
whole
lifetime
rises
up
before
the
mind
and
is
spread
out
like
a
scroll
before
the
eyes
of
those
who
feel
that
death
is
near
if
a
poet
had
chanced
to
pass
along
the
boulevard
he
would
have
found
an
interesting
picture
in
the
face
of
this
woman
grown
old
before
her
time
as
she
sat
under
the
dotted
shadow
of
the
acacia
the
shadow
the
acacia
casts
at
noon
a
thousand
thoughts
were
written
for
all
the
world
to
see
on
her
features
pale
and
cold
even
in
the
hot
bright
sunlight
there
was
something
sadder
than
the
sense
of
waning
life
in
that
expressive
face
some
trouble
that
went
deeper
than
the
weariness
of
experience
it
was
a
face
of
a
type
that
fixes
you
in
a
moment
among
a
host
of
characterless
faces
that
fail
to
draw
a
second
glance
a
face
to
set
you
thinking
among
a
thousand
pictures
in
a
gallery
you
are
strongly
impressed
by
the
sublime
anguish
on
the
face
of
some
madonna
of
murillo
s
by
some
in
which
guido
s
art
portrays
the
most
touching
innocence
against
a
background
of
horror
and
crime
by
the
awe
and
majesty
that
should
encircle
a
king
caught
once
and
for
ever
by
velasquez
in
the
sombre
face
of
a
philip
and
so
is
it
with
some
living
human
faces
they
are
tyrannous
pictures
which
speak
to
you
submit
you
to
searching
scrutiny
and
give
response
to
your
inmost
thoughts
nay
there
are
faces
that
set
forth
a
whole
drama
and
mme
d
aiglemont
s
stony
face
was
one
of
these
awful
tragedies
one
of
such
faces
as
dante
alighieri
saw
by
thousands
in
his
vision
for
the
little
season
that
a
woman
s
beauty
is
in
flower
it
serves
her
admirably
well
in
the
dissimulation
to
which
her
natural
weakness
and
our
social
laws
condemn
her
a
young
face
and
rich
color
and
eyes
that
glow
with
light
a
gracious
maze
of
such
subtle
manifold
lines
and
curves
flawless
and
perfectly
traced
is
a
screen
that
hides
everything
that
stirs
the
woman
within
a
flush
tells
nothing
it
only
heightens
the
coloring
so
brilliant
already
all
the
fires
that
burn
within
can
add
little
light
to
the
flame
of
life
in
eyes
which
only
seem
the
brighter
for
the
flash
of
a
passing
pain
nothing
is
so
discreet
as
a
young
face
for
nothing
is
less
mobile
it
has
the
serenity
the
surface
smoothness
and
the
freshness
of
a
lake
there
is
not
character
in
women
s
faces
before
the
age
of
thirty
the
painter
discovers
nothing
there
but
pink
and
white
and
the
smile
and
expression
that
repeat
the
same
thought
in
the
same
way
a
thought
of
youth
and
love
that
goes
no
further
than
youth
and
love
but
the
face
of
an
old
woman
has
expressed
all
that
lay
in
her
nature
passion
has
carved
lines
on
her
features
love
and
wifehood
and
motherhood
and
extremes
of
joy
and
anguish
having
wrung
them
and
left
their
traces
in
a
thousand
wrinkles
all
of
which
speak
a
language
of
their
own
then
it
is
that
a
woman
s
face
becomes
sublime
in
its
horror
beautiful
in
its
melancholy
grand
in
its
calm
if
it
is
permissible
to
carry
the
strange
metaphor
still
further
it
might
be
said
that
in
the
lake
you
can
see
the
traces
of
all
the
torrents
that
once
poured
into
it
and
made
it
what
it
is
an
old
face
is
nothing
to
the
frivolous
world
the
frivolous
world
is
shocked
by
the
sight
of
the
destruction
of
such
comeliness
as
it
can
understand
a
commonplace
artist
sees
nothing
there
an
old
face
is
the
province
of
the
poets
among
poets
of
those
who
can
recognize
that
something
which
is
called
beauty
apart
from
all
the
conventions
underlying
so
many
superstitions
in
art
and
taste
though
mme
d
aiglemont
wore
a
fashionable
bonnet
it
was
easy
to
see
that
her
once
black
hair
had
been
bleached
by
cruel
sorrows
yet
her
good
taste
and
the
gracious
acquired
instincts
of
a
woman
of
fashion
could
be
seen
in
the
way
she
wore
it
divided
into
two
following
the
outlines
of
a
forehead
that
still
retained
some
traces
of
former
dazzling
beauty
worn
and
lined
though
it
was
the
contours
of
her
face
the
regularity
of
her
features
gave
some
idea
faint
in
truth
of
that
beauty
of
which
surely
she
had
once
been
proud
but
those
traces
spoke
still
more
plainly
of
the
anguish
which
had
laid
it
waste
of
sharp
pain
that
had
withered
the
temples
and
made
those
hollows
in
her
cheeks
and
empurpled
the
eyelids
and
robbed
them
of
their
lashes
and
the
eyes
of
their
charm
she
was
in
every
way
so
noiseless
she
moved
with
a
slow
gravity
that
showed
itself
in
her
whole
bearing
and
struck
a
certain
awe
into
others
her
diffident
manner
had
changed
to
positive
shyness
due
apparently
to
a
habit
now
of
some
years
growth
of
effacing
herself
in
her
daughter
s
presence
she
spoke
very
seldom
and
in
the
low
tones
used
by
those
who
perforce
must
live
within
themselves
a
life
of
reflection
and
concentration
this
demeanor
led
others
to
regard
her
with
an
indefinable
feeling
which
was
neither
awe
nor
compassion
but
a
mysterious
blending
of
the
many
ideas
awakened
in
us
by
compassion
and
awe
finally
there
was
something
in
her
wrinkles
in
the
lines
of
her
face
in
the
look
of
pain
in
those
wan
eyes
of
hers
that
bore
eloquent
testimony
to
tears
that
never
had
fallen
tears
that
had
been
absorbed
by
her
heart
unhappy
creatures
accustomed
to
raise
their
eyes
to
heaven
in
mute
appeal
against
the
bitterness
of
their
lot
would
have
seen
at
once
from
her
eyes
that
she
was
broken
in
to
the
cruel
discipline
of
ceaseless
prayer
would
have
discerned
the
almost
imperceptible
symptoms
of
the
secret
bruises
which
destroy
all
the
flowers
of
the
soul
even
the
sentiment
of
motherhood
painters
have
colors
for
these
portraits
but
words
and
the
mental
images
called
up
by
words
fail
to
reproduce
such
impressions
faithfully
there
are
mysterious
signs
and
tokens
in
the
tones
of
the
coloring
and
in
the
look
of
human
faces
which
the
mind
only
seizes
through
the
sense
of
sight
and
the
poet
is
fain
to
record
the
tale
of
the
events
which
wrought
the
havoc
to
make
their
terrible
ravages
understood
the
face
spoke
of
cold
and
steady
storm
an
inward
conflict
between
a
mother
s
and
the
limitations
of
our
nature
for
our
human
affections
are
bounded
by
our
humanity
and
the
infinite
has
no
place
in
finite
creatures
sorrow
endured
in
silence
had
at
last
produced
an
indefinable
morbid
something
in
this
woman
doubtless
mental
anguish
had
reacted
on
the
physical
frame
and
some
disease
perhaps
an
aneurism
was
undermining
julie
s
life
grief
lies
to
all
appearance
very
quietly
in
the
depths
where
it
is
conceived
yet
so
still
and
apparently
dormant
as
it
is
it
ceaselessly
corrodes
the
soul
like
the
terrible
acid
which
eats
away
crystal
two
tears
made
their
way
down
the
marquise
s
cheeks
she
rose
to
her
feet
as
if
some
thought
more
poignant
than
any
that
preceded
it
had
cut
her
to
the
quick
she
had
doubtless
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
moina
s
future
and
now
foreseeing
clearly
all
the
troubles
in
store
for
her
child
the
sorrows
of
her
own
unhappy
life
had
begun
to
weigh
once
more
upon
her
the
key
of
her
position
must
be
sought
in
her
daughter
s
situation
the
comte
de
had
been
away
for
nearly
six
months
on
a
political
mission
the
countess
whether
from
sheer
giddiness
or
in
obedience
to
the
countless
instincts
of
woman
s
coquetry
or
to
essay
its
power
with
all
the
vanity
of
a
frivolous
fine
lady
all
the
capricious
waywardness
of
a
child
was
amusing
herself
during
her
husband
s
absence
by
playing
with
the
passion
of
a
clever
but
heartless
man
distracted
so
he
said
with
love
the
love
that
combines
readily
with
every
petty
social
ambition
of
a
coxcomb
mme
d
aiglemont
whose
long
experience
had
given
her
a
knowledge
of
life
and
taught
her
to
judge
of
men
and
to
dread
the
world
watched
the
course
of
this
flirtation
and
saw
that
it
could
only
end
in
one
way
if
her
daughter
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
an
utterly
unscrupulous
intriguer
how
could
it
be
other
than
a
terrible
thought
for
her
that
her
daughter
listened
willingly
to
this
her
darling
stood
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
she
felt
horribly
sure
of
it
yet
dared
not
hold
her
back
she
was
afraid
of
the
countess
she
knew
too
that
moina
would
not
listen
to
her
wise
warnings
she
knew
that
she
had
no
influence
over
that
nature
iron
for
her
for
all
others
her
mother
s
tenderness
might
have
led
her
to
sympathize
with
the
troubles
of
a
passion
called
forth
by
the
nobler
qualities
of
a
lover
but
this
was
no
passion
it
was
coquetry
and
the
marquise
despised
alfred
de
vandenesse
knowing
that
he
had
entered
upon
this
flirtation
with
moina
as
if
it
were
a
game
of
chess
but
if
alfred
de
vandenesse
made
her
shudder
with
disgust
she
was
obliged
unhappy
mother
to
conceal
the
strongest
reason
for
her
loathing
in
the
deepest
recesses
of
her
heart
she
was
on
terms
of
intimate
friendship
with
the
marquis
de
vandenesse
the
young
man
s
father
and
this
friendship
a
respectable
one
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
excused
the
son
s
constant
presence
in
the
house
he
professing
an
old
attachment
dating
from
childhood
for
mme
de
more
than
this
in
vain
did
mme
d
aiglemont
nerve
herself
to
come
between
moina
and
alfred
de
vandenesse
with
a
terrible
word
knowing
beforehand
that
she
should
not
succeed
knowing
that
the
strong
reason
which
ought
to
separate
them
would
carry
no
weight
that
she
should
humiliate
herself
vainly
in
her
daughter
s
eyes
alfred
was
too
corrupt
moina
too
clever
to
believe
the
revelation
the
young
countess
would
turn
it
off
and
treat
it
as
a
piece
of
maternal
strategy
mme
d
aiglemont
had
built
her
prison
walls
with
her
own
hands
she
had
immured
herself
only
to
see
moina
s
happiness
ruined
thence
before
she
died
she
was
to
look
on
helplessly
at
the
ruin
of
the
young
life
which
had
been
her
pride
and
joy
and
comfort
a
life
a
thousand
times
dearer
to
her
than
her
own
what
words
can
describe
anguish
so
hideous
beyond
belief
such
unfathomed
depths
of
pain
she
waited
for
moina
to
rise
with
the
impatience
and
sickening
dread
of
a
doomed
man
who
longs
to
have
done
with
life
and
turns
cold
at
the
thought
of
the
headsman
she
had
braced
herself
for
a
last
effort
but
perhaps
the
prospect
of
the
certain
failure
of
the
attempt
was
less
dreadful
to
her
than
the
fear
of
receiving
yet
again
one
of
those
thrusts
that
went
to
her
very
heart
before
that
fear
her
courage
ebbed
away
her
mother
s
love
had
come
to
this
to
love
her
child
to
be
afraid
of
her
to
shrink
from
the
thought
of
the
stab
yet
to
go
forward
so
great
is
a
mother
s
affection
in
a
loving
nature
that
before
it
can
fade
away
into
indifference
the
mother
herself
must
die
or
find
support
in
some
great
power
without
her
in
religion
or
another
love
since
the
marquise
rose
that
morning
her
fatal
memory
had
called
up
before
her
some
of
those
things
so
slight
to
all
appearance
that
make
landmarks
in
a
life
sometimes
indeed
a
whole
tragedy
grows
out
of
a
single
gesture
the
tone
in
which
a
few
words
were
spoken
rends
a
whole
life
in
two
a
glance
into
indifferent
eyes
is
the
deathblow
of
the
gladdest
love
and
unhappily
such
gestures
and
such
words
were
only
too
familiar
to
mme
d
aiglemont
she
had
met
so
many
glances
that
wound
the
soul
no
there
was
nothing
in
those
memories
to
bid
her
hope
on
the
contrary
everything
went
to
show
that
alfred
had
destroyed
her
hold
on
her
daughter
s
heart
that
the
thought
of
her
was
now
associated
with
duty
not
with
gladness
in
ways
innumerable
in
things
that
were
mere
trifles
in
themselves
the
countess
detestable
conduct
rose
up
before
her
mother
and
the
marquise
it
may
be
looked
on
moina
s
undutifulness
as
a
punishment
and
found
excuses
for
her
daughter
in
the
will
of
heaven
that
so
she
still
might
adore
the
hand
that
smote
her
all
these
things
passed
through
her
memory
that
morning
and
each
recollection
wounded
her
afresh
so
sorely
that
with
a
very
little
additional
pain
her
brimming
cup
of
bitterness
must
have
overflowed
a
cold
look
might
kill
her
the
little
details
of
domestic
life
are
difficult
to
paint
but
one
or
two
perhaps
will
suffice
to
give
an
idea
of
the
rest
the
marquise
d
aiglemont
for
instance
had
grown
rather
deaf
but
she
could
never
induce
moina
to
raise
her
voice
for
her
once
with
the
naivete
of
suffering
she
had
begged
moina
to
repeat
some
remark
which
she
had
failed
to
catch
and
moina
obeyed
but
with
so
bad
a
grace
the
mme
d
aiglemont
had
never
permitted
herself
to
make
her
modest
request
again
ever
since
that
day
when
moina
was
talking
or
retailing
a
piece
of
news
her
mother
was
careful
to
come
near
to
listen
but
this
infirmity
of
deafness
appeared
to
put
the
countess
out
of
patience
and
she
would
grumble
thoughtlessly
about
it
this
instance
is
one
from
among
very
many
that
must
have
gone
to
the
mother
s
heart
and
yet
nearly
all
of
them
might
have
escaped
a
close
observer
they
consisted
in
faint
shades
of
manner
invisible
to
any
but
a
woman
s
eyes
take
another
example
mme
d
aiglemont
happened
to
say
one
day
that
the
princesse
de
cadignan
had
called
upon
her
did
she
come
to
see
moina
exclaimed
that
was
all
but
the
countess
voice
and
manner
expressed
surprise
and
contempt
in
semitones
any
heart
still
young
and
sensitive
might
well
have
applauded
the
philanthropy
of
savage
tribes
who
kill
off
their
old
people
when
they
grow
too
feeble
to
cling
to
a
strongly
shaken
bough
mme
d
aiglemont
rose
smiling
and
went
away
to
weep
alone
people
and
women
especially
only
betray
their
feelings
by
imperceptible
touches
but
those
who
can
look
back
over
their
own
experience
on
such
bruises
as
this
mother
s
heart
received
know
also
how
the
vibrate
to
these
light
touches
overcome
by
her
memories
mme
d
aiglemont
recollected
one
of
those
microscopically
small
things
so
stinging
and
so
painful
was
it
that
never
till
this
moment
had
she
felt
all
the
heartless
contempt
that
lurked
beneath
smiles
at
the
sound
of
shutters
thrown
back
at
her
daughter
s
windows
she
dried
her
tears
and
hastened
up
the
pathway
by
the
railings
as
she
went
it
struck
her
that
the
gardener
had
been
unusually
careful
to
rake
the
sand
along
the
walk
which
had
been
neglected
for
some
little
time
as
she
stood
under
her
daughter
s
windows
the
shutters
were
hastily
closed
moina
is
it
you
she
asked
no
answer
the
marquise
went
on
into
the
house
mme
la
comtesse
is
in
the
little
said
the
maid
when
the
marquise
asked
whether
mme
de
had
finished
dressing
mme
d
aiglemont
hurried
to
the
little
her
heart
was
too
full
her
brain
too
busy
to
notice
matters
so
slight
but
there
on
the
sofa
sat
the
countess
in
her
loose
her
hair
in
disorder
under
the
cap
tossed
carelessly
on
he
head
her
feet
thrust
into
slippers
the
key
of
her
bedroom
hung
at
her
girdle
her
face
aglow
with
color
bore
traces
of
almost
stormy
thought
what
makes
people
come
in
she
cried
crossly
oh
it
is
you
mother
she
interrupted
herself
with
a
preoccupied
look
yes
child
it
is
your
mother
something
in
her
tone
turned
those
words
into
an
outpouring
of
the
heart
the
cry
of
some
deep
inward
feeling
only
to
be
described
by
the
word
so
thoroughly
in
truth
had
she
rehabilitated
the
sacred
character
of
a
mother
that
her
daughter
was
impressed
and
turned
towards
her
with
something
of
awe
uneasiness
and
remorse
in
her
manner
the
room
was
the
furthest
of
a
suite
and
safe
from
indiscreet
intrusion
for
no
one
could
enter
it
without
giving
warning
of
approach
through
the
previous
apartments
the
marquise
closed
the
door
it
is
my
duty
my
child
to
warn
you
in
one
of
the
most
serious
crises
in
the
lives
of
us
women
you
have
perhaps
reached
it
unconsciously
and
i
am
come
to
speak
to
you
as
a
friend
rather
than
as
a
mother
when
you
married
you
acquired
freedom
of
action
you
are
only
accountable
to
your
husband
now
but
i
asserted
my
authority
so
little
perhaps
i
was
wrong
that
i
think
i
have
a
right
to
expect
you
to
listen
to
me
for
once
at
least
in
a
critical
position
when
you
must
need
counsel
bear
in
mind
moina
that
you
are
married
to
a
man
of
high
ability
a
man
of
whom
you
may
well
be
proud
a
man
who
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
mother
moina
broke
in
pettishly
i
am
to
be
lectured
about
alfred
moina
the
marquise
said
gravely
as
she
struggled
with
her
tears
you
would
not
guess
at
once
if
you
did
not
feel
what
asked
moina
almost
haughtily
why
really
mother
mme
d
aiglemont
summoned
up
all
her
strength
moina
she
said
you
must
attend
carefully
to
this
that
i
ought
to
tell
you
i
am
attending
returned
the
countess
folding
her
arms
and
affecting
insolent
submission
permit
me
mother
to
ring
for
pauline
she
added
with
incredible
i
will
send
her
away
she
rang
the
bell
my
dear
child
pauline
can
not
possibly
hear
mamma
interrupted
the
countess
with
a
gravity
which
must
have
struck
her
mother
as
something
unusual
i
must
she
stopped
short
for
the
woman
was
in
the
room
pauline
go
to
baudran
s
and
ask
why
my
hat
has
not
yet
been
then
the
countess
reseated
herself
and
scrutinized
her
mother
the
marquise
with
a
swelling
heart
and
dry
eyes
in
painful
agitation
which
none
but
a
mother
can
fully
understand
began
to
open
moina
s
eyes
to
the
risk
that
she
was
running
but
either
the
countess
felt
hurt
and
indignant
at
her
mother
s
suspicions
of
a
son
of
the
marquis
de
vandenesse
or
she
was
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
inexplicable
levity
caused
by
the
inexperience
of
youth
she
took
advantage
of
a
pause
mamma
i
thought
you
were
only
jealous
of
she
said
with
a
forced
laugh
mme
d
aiglemont
shut
her
eyes
and
bent
her
head
at
the
words
with
a
very
faint
almost
inaudible
sigh
she
looked
up
and
out
into
space
as
if
she
felt
the
common
overmastering
impulse
to
appeal
to
god
at
the
great
crises
of
our
lives
then
she
looked
at
her
daughter
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
awful
majesty
and
the
expression
of
profound
sorrow
my
child
she
said
and
her
voice
was
hardly
recognizable
you
have
been
less
merciful
to
your
mother
than
he
against
whom
she
sinned
less
merciful
than
perhaps
god
himself
will
be
mme
d
aiglemont
rose
at
the
door
she
turned
but
she
saw
nothing
but
surprise
in
her
daughter
s
face
she
went
out
scarcely
had
she
reached
the
garden
when
her
strength
failed
her
there
was
a
violent
pain
at
her
heart
and
she
sank
down
on
a
bench
as
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
path
she
saw
fresh
marks
on
the
path
a
man
s
footprints
were
distinctly
recognizable
it
was
too
late
then
beyond
a
doubt
now
she
began
to
understand
the
reason
for
that
order
given
to
pauline
and
with
these
torturing
thoughts
came
a
revelation
more
hateful
than
any
that
had
gone
before
it
she
drew
her
own
inferences
the
son
of
the
marquis
de
vandenesse
had
destroyed
all
feeling
of
respect
for
her
in
her
daughter
s
mind
the
physical
pain
grew
worse
by
degrees
she
lost
consciousness
and
sat
like
one
asleep
upon
the
the
countess
de
left
to
herself
thought
that
her
mother
had
given
her
a
somewhat
shrewd
but
a
kiss
and
a
few
attentions
that
evening
would
make
all
right
again
a
shrill
cry
came
from
the
garden
she
leaned
carelessly
out
as
pauline
not
yet
departed
on
her
errand
called
out
for
help
holding
the
marquise
in
her
arms
do
not
frighten
my
daughter
those
were
the
last
words
the
mother
uttered
moina
saw
them
carry
in
a
pale
and
lifeless
form
that
struggled
for
breath
and
arms
moving
restlessly
as
in
protest
or
effort
to
speak
and
overcome
by
the
sight
moina
followed
in
silence
and
helped
to
undress
her
mother
and
lay
her
on
her
bed
the
burden
of
her
fault
was
greater
than
she
could
bear
in
that
supreme
hour
she
learned
to
know
her
mother
too
late
she
could
make
no
reparation
now
she
would
have
them
leave
her
alone
with
her
mother
and
when
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
when
she
felt
that
the
hand
which
had
always
been
so
tender
for
her
was
now
grown
cold
to
her
touch
she
broke
out
into
weeping
her
tears
aroused
the
marquise
she
could
still
look
at
her
darling
moina
and
at
the
sound
of
sobbing
that
seemed
as
if
it
must
rend
the
delicate
disheveled
breast
could
smile
back
at
her
daughter
that
smile
taught
the
unnatural
child
that
forgiveness
is
always
to
be
found
in
the
great
deep
of
a
mother
s
heart

the
younger
and
her
little
sons
arrived
with
the
medical
men
a
sufficiently
impressive
silent
and
anxious
little
group
which
the
servants
of
the
house
came
to
join
the
young
marquise
hearing
no
sound
tapped
gently
at
the
door
that
signal
doubtless
roused
moina
from
her
grief
for
she
flung
open
the
doors
and
stood
before
them
no
words
could
have
spoken
more
plainly
than
that
disheveled
figure
looking
out
with
haggard
eyes
upon
the
assembled
family
before
that
living
picture
of
remorse
the
rest
were
dumb
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
marquise
s
feet
were
stretched
out
stark
and
stiff
with
the
agony
of
death
and
moina
leaning
against
the
looking
into
their
faces
spoke
in
a
hollow
voice
