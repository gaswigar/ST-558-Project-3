preface
this
volume
presents
the
narrative
from
my
point
of
view
of
an
important
government
expedition
of
nearly
forty
years
ago
an
expedition
which
strangely
enough
never
before
has
been
fully
treated
in
fact
in
all
these
years
it
never
has
been
written
about
by
any
one
besides
myself
barring
a
few
letters
in
from
clement
powell
through
his
brother
to
the
chicago
and
an
extremely
brief
mention
by
major
powell
its
organiser
and
leader
in
a
pamphlet
entitled
of
explorations
in
of
the
colorado
of
the
west
and
its
government
printing
office
in
my
history
romance
of
the
colorado
of
which
this
is
practically
volume
two
i
gave
a
synopsis
and
in
several
other
places
i
have
written
in
condensed
form
concerning
it
but
the
present
work
for
the
first
time
gives
the
full
story
in
major
powell
made
his
famous
first
descent
of
the
river
from
the
union
pacific
railway
in
wyoming
to
the
mouth
of
the
virgin
river
in
nevada
a
feat
of
exploration
unsurpassed
perhaps
unequalled
on
this
continent
several
of
the
upper
canyons
had
been
before
penetrated
but
a
vague
mystery
hung
over
even
these
and
there
was
no
recorded
or
even
oral
knowledge
on
the
subject
when
powell
turned
his
attention
to
it
there
was
a
tale
that
a
man
named
james
white
had
previously
descended
through
the
great
canyons
but
robert
brewster
stanton
has
thoroughly
investigated
this
and
definitely
proven
it
to
be
incorrect
powell
first
expedition
was
designed
as
an
exploration
to
cover
ten
months
part
of
which
was
to
be
in
winter
quarters
circumstances
reduced
the
time
to
three
it
was
also
more
or
less
of
a
private
venture
with
which
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
nothing
to
do
it
became
necessary
to
supplement
it
then
by
a
second
expedition
herein
described
which
congress
supported
with
of
course
major
powell
in
charge
and
nominally
under
the
direction
of
the
smithsonian
institution
of
which
professor
henry
was
then
secretary
and
professor
baird
his
able
coadjutor
the
latter
taking
the
deeper
interest
in
this
venture
powell
reported
through
the
smithsonian
that
was
about
all
there
was
in
the
way
of
control
the
material
collected
by
this
expedition
was
utilised
in
preparing
the
report
by
major
powell
of
the
colorado
river
of
the
west
the
second
party
having
continued
the
work
inaugurated
by
the
first
and
enlarged
upon
it
but
receiving
no
credit
in
that
or
any
other
government
publication
as
pointed
out
in
the
text
of
this
work
a
vast
portion
of
the
basin
of
the
colorado
was
a
complete
blank
on
the
maps
until
our
party
accomplished
its
end
even
some
of
the
most
general
features
were
before
that
not
understood
no
canyon
above
the
virgin
had
been
recorded
topographically
and
the
physiography
was
unknown
the
record
of
the
first
expedition
is
one
of
heroic
daring
and
it
demonstrated
that
the
river
could
be
descended
throughout
in
boats
but
unforeseen
obstacles
prevented
the
acquisition
of
scientific
data
which
ours
was
specially
planned
to
secure
in
the
light
of
the
former
developments
the
map
the
hypsometric
and
hydrographic
data
the
geologic
sections
and
geologic
data
the
photographs
ethnography
and
indeed
about
all
the
first
information
concerning
the
drainage
area
in
question
were
the
results
of
the
labours
of
the
second
expedition
owing
perhaps
to
major
considering
our
work
merely
in
the
line
of
routine
survey
no
special
record
as
mentioned
above
was
ever
made
of
the
second
expedition
we
inherited
from
the
first
a
plat
of
the
river
itself
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
paria
which
according
to
professor
thompson
was
fairly
good
but
we
did
not
rely
on
it
from
the
mouth
of
the
paria
to
catastrophe
rapid
the
point
below
diamond
creek
where
the
howlands
and
dunn
separated
from
the
boat
party
a
plat
that
was
broken
in
places
this
was
approximately
correct
as
far
as
kanab
canyon
though
not
so
good
as
above
the
paria
from
the
kanab
canyon
where
we
ended
our
work
with
the
boats
to
the
mouth
of
the
virgin
we
received
fragments
of
the
course
owing
to
the
mistake
made
in
dividing
the
notes
at
the
time
of
the
separation
a
division
decided
on
because
each
group
thought
the
other
doomed
to
destruction
thus
howland
took
out
with
him
parts
of
both
copies
which
were
destroyed
by
the
shewits
when
they
killed
the
men
after
departure
the
major
ran
in
the
course
to
the
mouth
of
the
virgin
professor
thompson
was
confident
that
our
plat
of
the
course
which
is
the
basis
of
all
maps
is
accurate
from
the
union
pacific
railway
in
wyoming
to
catastrophe
rapid
for
though
we
left
the
river
at
the
kanab
canyon
we
were
able
by
our
previous
and
subsequent
work
on
land
to
verify
the
data
of
the
first
party
and
to
fill
in
the
blanks
but
he
felt
ready
to
accept
corrections
below
catastrophe
rapid
to
the
virgin
for
a
list
of
the
canyons
height
of
walls
i
must
refer
to
the
appendix
in
my
previous
volume
while
two
names
cover
the
canyon
from
the
paria
to
the
grand
wash
the
gorge
is
practically
one
with
a
total
length
of
miles
i
have
not
tried
to
give
geological
data
for
these
are
easily
obtainable
in
the
reports
of
powell
dutton
gilbert
walcott
and
others
and
i
lacked
space
to
introduce
them
properly
in
fact
i
have
endeavored
to
avoid
a
mere
perfunctory
record
full
of
data
well
stated
elsewhere
while
trying
to
give
our
daily
experiences
and
actual
camp
life
in
a
readable
way
i
have
adhered
to
accuracy
of
statement
i
believe
that
any
one
who
wishes
to
do
so
can
use
this
book
as
a
guide
for
navigating
the
river
as
far
as
kanab
canyon
i
have
not
relied
on
memory
but
have
kept
for
continual
reference
at
my
elbow
not
only
my
own
careful
diary
of
the
journey
but
also
the
manuscript
diary
of
professor
thompson
and
a
typewritten
copy
of
the
diary
of
john
steward
as
far
as
the
day
of
his
departure
from
our
camp
i
have
also
consulted
letters
that
i
wrote
home
at
the
time
and
to
the
buffalo
and
a
detailed
draft
of
events
up
to
the
autumn
of
which
i
prepared
in
when
all
was
still
vividly
fresh
in
mind
in
addition
i
possess
a
great
many
letters
which
professor
thompson
wrote
me
up
to
within
a
few
weeks
of
his
death
july
often
in
reply
to
questions
i
raised
on
various
points
that
were
not
clear
to
me
each
member
of
the
party
i
have
called
by
the
name
familiarly
used
on
the
expedition
for
naturally
there
was
no
mistering
on
a
trip
of
this
kind
powell
was
known
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
rocky
mountain
region
as
the
major
while
thompson
was
quite
as
widely
known
as
some
of
the
geographic
terms
like
dirty
devil
river
unknown
mountains
were
those
employed
before
permanent
names
were
adopted
in
my
other
books
i
have
used
the
term
amerind
for
american
indian
and
i
intend
to
continue
its
use
but
in
the
pages
of
this
volume
being
a
narrative
and
the
word
not
having
been
used
or
known
to
us
at
that
time
it
did
not
seem
exactly
appropriate
some
readers
may
wish
to
provide
themselves
with
full
maps
of
the
course
of
the
river
and
i
will
state
that
the
geological
survey
has
published
each
by
inches
of
the
whole
course

disastrous
the
river
is
always
a
new
problem
in
its
details
though
the
general
conditions
remain
the
same
major
powell
was
a
man
of
prompt
decision
with
a
cool
comprehensive
mind
he
was
genial
kind
never
despondent
always
resolute
resourceful
masterful
determined
to
overcome
every
obstacle
to
him
alone
belongs
the
credit
for
solving
the
problem
of
the
great
canyons
and
to
professor
thompson
that
for
conducting
most
successfully
the
geographic
side
of
the
work
under
difficulties
that
can
hardly
be
appreciated
in
these
days
when
survey
work
is
an
accepted
item
of
government
expenditure
and
congress
treats
it
with
an
open
hand
i
am
indebted
to
robert
brewster
stanton
who
completed
the
brown
expedition
triumphantly
for
valuable
information
and
photographs
and
for
many
interesting
conversations
comparing
his
experiences
with
ours
to
the
geological
survey
for
maps
and
for
the
privilege
of
using
photographs
from
negatives
in
the
possession
of
the
survey
and
to
john
hillers
for
making
most
of
the
prints
used
in
illustrating
this
book
my
thanks
are
due
to
mackenzie
engineers
for
copies
of
rare
early
maps
of
the
region
embraced
in
our
operations
now
nearly
impossible
to
obtain
in
when
i
informed
major
powell
that
i
was
preparing
my
history
of
the
colorado
river
he
said
he
hoped
that
i
would
put
on
record
the
second
trip
and
the
men
who
were
members
of
that
expedition
which
i
accordingly
did
he
never
ceased
to
take
a
lively
interest
in
my
affairs
and
the
year
before
he
wrote
me
i
always
delight
in
your
successes
and
your
prosperity
and
i
ever
cherish
the
memory
of
those
days
when
we
were
on
the
great
river
together
professor
thompson
only
a
month
before
he
died
sent
me
a
letter
in
which
he
said
you
are
heir
to
all
the
colorado
material
and
i
am
getting
what
i
have
together
these
sentiments
cause
me
to
feel
like
an
authorised
and
rightful
historian
of
the
expedition
with
which
i
was
so
intimately
connected
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
i
have
performed
my
task
in
a
way
that
would
meet
the
approval
of
my
old
leader
and
his
colleague
as
well
as
of
my
other
comrades
one
learns
microscopically
the
inner
nature
of
his
companions
on
a
trip
of
this
kind
and
i
am
happy
to
avow
that
a
finer
set
of
men
could
not
have
been
selected
for
the
trying
work
which
they
accomplished
with
unremitting
and
devotion
without
pecuniary
reward
professor
thompson
possessed
invaluable
qualities
for
this
expedition
rare
balance
of
mind
great
cheerfulness
and
a
sunny
way
of
looking
on
difficulties
and
obstacles
as
if
they
were
mere
problems
in
chess
his
foresight
and
resourcefulness
were
phenomenal
and
no
threatening
situation
found
him
without
some
good
remedy
some
of
the
illustrations
in
powell
are
misleading
and
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
specially
note
three
of
them
the
one
opposite
page
shows
boats
of
the
type
we
used
on
the
second
voyage
with
a
middle
cabin
the
boats
of
the
first
expedition
had
cabins
only
at
the
bow
and
stern
the
picture
of
the
wreck
at
disaster
falls
opposite
page
is
nothing
like
the
place
and
the
one
opposite
page
gives
boats
in
impossible
positions
steered
by
rudders
a
rudder
is
useless
on
such
a
river
long
steering
sweeps
were
used
time
changes
have
come
to
pass
you
may
now
go
by
a
luxurious
santa
fé
train
direct
to
the
south
rim
of
the
greatest
chasm
of
the
series
the
grand
canyon
and
stop
there
in
a
beautiful
hotel
surrounded
by
every
comfort
yet
when
we
were
making
the
first
map
no
railway
short
of
denver
existed
and
there
was
but
one
line
across
the
rocky
mountains
perhaps
before
many
more
years
are
gone
we
will
see
denver
colorado
canyon
and
pacific
railway
accomplished
through
the
canyons
and
if
i
then
have
not
crossed
to
killiloo
i
will
surely
claim
a
free
pass
over
the
entire
length
in
defiance
of
all

at
that
period
the
meeting

of

various
companies
and
organisations
and
of

trappers
by
the
year
the
vast
region
west
of
the
missouri
had
been
completely
investigated
by
the
trappers
and
in
the
pursuit
of
trade
with
the
exception
of
the
river
from
the
foot
of
green
river
valley
to
the
termination
of
the
now
famous
grand

of

the
reason
for
this
exception
was
that
at
the
southern
extremity
of
green
river
valley
the
solid
obstacle
of
the
uinta
range
was
thrown
in
an
easterly
and
westerly
trend
directly
across
the
course
of
the
river
which
finding
no
alternative
had
carved
its
way
in
the
course
of
a
long
geological
epoch
through
the
foundations
of
the
mountains
in
a
series
of
gorges
with
extremely
precipitous
sides
continuous
parallel
cliffs
between
whose
forbidding
precipices
dashed
the
torrent
towards
the
sea
having
thus
entrapped
itself
the

stream
by
the
configuration
of
the
succeeding
region
was
forced
to
continue
its
assault
on
the
rocks
to
reach
the
gulf
and
ground
its
fierce
progress
through
canyon
after
canyon
with
scarcely
an
intermission
of
open
country
for
a
full
thousand
miles
from
the
beginning
of
its
entombment
the
entrance
of
flaming
gorge
at
the
foot
of
the
historical
green
river
valley
some
few
attempts
had
been
made
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
this
long
series
of
chasms
but
with
such
small
success
that
the
exploration
of
the
river
was
given
up
as
too
difficult
and
too
dangerous
ashley
had
gone
through
red
canyon
in
and
in
one
of
the
succeeding
winters
of
that
period
a
party
had
passed
through
lodore
on
the
ice
these
trips
proved
that
the
canyons
were
not
the
haunt
of
beaver
that
the
navigation
of
them
was
vastly
difficult
and
that
no
man
could
tell
what
might
befall
in
those
gorges
further
down
that
were
deeper
longer
and
still
more
remote
from
any
touch
with
the
outer
world
indeed
it
was
even
reported
that
there
were
places
where
the
whole
river
disappeared
underground
the
indians
as
a
rule
kept
away
from
the
canyons
for
there
was
little
to
attract
them
one
bold
ute
who
attempted
to
shorten
his
trail
by
means
of
the
river
shortened
it
to
the
happy
hunting
grounds
immediately
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
fate
to
inspire
emulation
the
years
then
wore
on
and
the
colorado
remained
unknown
through
its
canyon
division
ives
had
come
up
to
near
the
mouth
of
the
virgin
from
the
gulf
of
california
in
and
the
portion
above
flaming
gorge
from
the
foot
of

valley
was
fairly
well
known

james
white
was
picked
up
at
a
point
below
the
mouth
of
the
virgin
in
an
exhausted
state
and
it
was
assumed
that
he
had
made
a
large
part
of
the
terrible
voyage
on
a
raft
but
this
was
not
the
case
and
the
colorado
river
canyons
still
waited
for
a
conqueror
he
came
in
in
the
person
of
john
wesley
powell
a
late
major
in
the
civil
war
whose
scientific
studies
had
led
him
to
the
then
territory
of
colorado
where
his
mind
became
fired
with
the
intention
of
exploring
the
canyons
the
idea
was
carried
out
and
the
river
was
descended
from
the
union
pacific
railway
crossing
to
the
mouth
of
the
virgin
and
two
of
the
men
went
on
to
the
sea
thus
the
great
feat
was
accomplished
one
of
the
greatest
feats
of

an

scientific
side

venture
this

was

the

having
been
a

or

private
enterprise
congress
made
appropriations
and
the
party
were
to
start
in
this
was
found
to
be
inexpedient
for
several
reasons
among
which
was
the
necessity
of
exploring
a
route
by
which
rations
could
be
brought
in
to
them

i
became

of
the
second

scores
of
men
were
turned
away
disappointed
the
party
was
a
small
one
and
it
was
full
we
were
to
begin
our
voyage
through
the
chain
of
great
canyons
at
the
same
point
where
the
first
expedition
started
the
point
where
the
recently
completed
union
pacific
railway
crossed
green
river
in
wyoming
and
we
arrived
there
from
the
east
early
on
the
morning
of
april
we
were
all
ravenous
after
the
long
night
on
the
train
and
breakfast
was
the
first
consideration
but
when
this
had
our
energy
we
went
to
look
for
the
flat
car
with
our
boats
which
had
been
sent
ahead
from
chicago
the
car
was
soon
found
on
a
siding
and
with
the
help
of
some
railroad
employés
we
pushed
it
along
to
the
eastern
end
of
the
bridge
over
green
river
and
there
on
the
down
side
put
the
boats
into
the
waters
against
whose
onslaughts
they
were
to
be
our
salvation
it
was
lucky
perhaps
that
we
did
not
pause
to
ponder
on
the
importance
of
these
little
craft
on
how
much
depended
on
their
staunchness
and
stability
and
on
our
possible
success
in
preventing
their
destruction
the
river
was
high
from
melting
snows
and
the
current
was
swift
though
ordinarily
it
is
not
a
large
river
at
this
point
this
season
had
been
selected
for
the
start
because
of
the
high
water
which
would
tide
us
over
the
rocks
till
tributary
streams
should
swell
the
normal
volume
for
our
boats
were
to
be
well
loaded
there
being
no
chance
to
get
supplies
after
leaving
we
had
some
trouble
in
making
a
landing
where
we
wanted
to
in
a
little
cove
on
the
east
side
about
half
a
mile
down
which
had
been
selected
as
a
good
place
for
our
preparatory
operations
here
the
three
boats
were
hauled
out
to
receive
the
final
touches
they
were
named
and
a
space
was
cleared
in
the
thick
willows
for
our
general
camp
over
which
andy
was
to
be
master
of
ceremonies
at
least
so
far
as
the
banqueting
division
was
concerned
and
here
he
became
initiated
into
the
chemistry
necessary
to
transform
raw
materials
into
comparatively
edible
food
but
it
was
not
so
hard
a
task
for
our
supplies
were
flour
beans
bacon
dried
apples
and
dried
peaches
tea
and
coffee
with
of
course
plenty
of
sugar
canned
goods
at
that
time
were
not
common
and
besides
would
have
been
too
heavy
bread
must
be
baked
three
times
a
day
in
the
dutch
oven
a
sort
of
skillet
of
cast
iron
about
three
inches
deep
ten
or
twelve
inches
in
diameter
with
short
legs
and
a
cover
with
a
rim
that
would
hold
hot
coals
we
had
no
other
bread
than
was
made
in
this
oven
or
in
a
with
saleratus
and
cream
of
tartar
to
raise
it
it
was
andy
first
experience
as
a
cook
though
he
had
been
a
soldier
in
the
civil
war
as
had
almost
every
member
of
the
party
except
the
youngest
three
clem
frank
and
myself
i
being
the
youngest
of
all
for
sleeping
quarters
we
were
disposed
in
two
vacant
wooden
shanties
about
two
hundred
yards
apart
and
a
somewhat
greater
distance
from
the
these
shanties
were
mansions
left
over
like
a
group
of
roofless
adobe
ruins
near
by
from
the
opulent
days
of
a
year
or
two
back
when
this
place
had
been
the
terminus
of
the
line
during
building
operations
little
remained
of
its
whilom
grandeur
a
section
house
a
railway
station
a
number
of
domiciles
outfitting
store
and
the
aforesaid
shanties
in
which
we
secured
refuge
being
about
all
there
was
of
the
place
the
region
round
about
suggested
the
strangeness
of
the
wild
country
below
through
the
midst
of
which
led
our
trail
arid
and
gravelly
hills
met
the
eye
on
all
sides
accentuated
by
huge
buttes
and
cliffs
of
brilliant
colours
which
in
their
turn
were
intensified
by
a
clear
sky
of
deep
azure
in
the
midst
of
our
operations
we
found
time
to
note
the
passing
of
the
single
express
train
each
way
daily
these
trains
seemed
very
friendly
and
the
passengers
gazed
wonderingly
from
the
windows
at
us
and
waved
handkerchiefs
they
perceived
what
we
were
about
by
the
sign
which
i
painted
on
cloth
and
fastened
across
the
front
of
our
house
which
was
near
the
track
powell
colorado
river

above
this
was
flying
our
general
flag
the
stars
and

the
white
boats
were
thoroughly
gone
over
with
and
paint
upon
the
decks
of
the
cabins
canvas
painted
green
was
stretched
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
be
unbuttoned
at
the
edges
on
three
sides
and
thrown
back
when
we
wanted
to
take
off
the
hatches
when
in
place
this
canvas
kept
the
water
perfectly
out
of
the
hatch
joints
each
boat
had
three
compartments
the
middle
one
being
about
four
feet
long
about
the
length
of
the
boat
which
was
feet
over
the
top
two
places
were
left
for
the
rowers
before
and
abaft
the
middle
compartment
while
the
steersman
with
his
long
oar
thrust
behind
was
to
sit
on
the
deck
of
the
all
the
decks
being
flush
with
the
gunwale
except
that
of
the
forward
cabin
the
deck
of
which
was
carried
back
in
a
straighter
line
than
the
sheer
of
the
boat
and
thus
formed
a
nose
to
help
throw
off
the
waves
it
was
believed
that
when
the
hatches
were
firmly
in
place
and
the
canvases
drawn
taut
over
the
decks
even
if
a
boat
turned
over
as
was
expected
sometimes
might
be
the
case
the
contents
of
these
cabins
would
remain
intact
and
dry
as
so
much
depended
on
keeping
our
goods
dry
and
as
we
knew
from
powell
previous
experience
that
the
voyage
would
be
a
wet
one
everything
was
carefully
put
in
rubber
sacks
each
having
a
soft
mouth
inside
a
double
lip
with
a
row
of
eyelets
in
each
lip
through
which
ran
a
strong
cord
when
the
soft
mouth
was
rolled
up
and
the
bag
squeezed
the
air
was
forced
out
and
the
lips
could
be
drawn
to
a
bunch
by
means
of
the
cord
when
in
this
condition
the
bag
could
be
soaked
a
long
time
in
water
without
wetting
the
contents
each
rubber
bag
was
encased
in
a
heavy
cotton
one
to
protect
it
in
short
we
spared
no
effort
to
render
our
provisions
proof
against
the
destroying
elements
at
first
we
put
the
bacon
into
rubber
but
it
spoiled
the
rubber
and
then
we
saw
that
bacon
can
take
care
of
itself
nothing
can
hurt
it
anyhow
and
a
was
all
that
was
necessary
though
the
boats
were
five
feet
in
the
beam
and
about
inches
in
depth
their
capacity
was
limited
and
the
supplies
we
could
take
must
correspond
each
man
was
restricted
to
one
hundred
pounds
of
baggage
including
his
blankets
he
had
one
rubber
bag
for
the
latter
and
another
for
his
clothing
and
personal
effects
in
the
provision
line
we
had
sacks
of
flour
of
fifty
pounds
each
there
was
no
whiskey
so
far
as
i
ever
knew
except
a
small
flask
containing
about
one
gill
which
i
had
been
given
with
a
for
the
journey
this
flask
was
never
drawn
upon
and
was
intact

needed
as

in
october
smoking
was
abandoned
though
a
case
of
smoking
tobacco
was
taken
for
any
indians
we
might
meet
our
photographic
outfit
was
extremely
bulky
and
heavy
for
the
dry
plate
had
not
been
invented
we
had
to
carry
a
large
amount
of
glass
and
chemicals
as
well
as
apparatus
the
numerous
scientific
instruments
also
were
bulky
as
they
had
to
be
fitted
into
wooden
cases
that
were
covered
with
canvas
and
then
with
rubber
rations
in
quantity
were
not
obtainable

the
major
and
his
colleague
professor
thompson
went
to
fort
bridger
and
to
salt
lake
to
secure
what
was
necessary
and
to
make
further
arrangements
for

where
they
were
to
wait
for
news
from
the
expedition
when
we
should
get
in
touch
with
the
uinta
agency
at
the
mouth
of
the

something
over
two
hundred
miles
further
down
at
length
all
was
provided
for
and
the
major
and
returned
to
our
camp
from
salt
lake
bringing
a
new
member
of
the
party
jack
hillers
to
take
the
place
of
jack
sumner
of
the
former
party
who
was
unable
to
get
to
us
on
account
of
the
deep
snows
in
the
mountains
which
surrounded
the
retreat
where
he
had
spent
the
winter
trapping
brought
back
also
an
american
flag
for
each
boat
with
the
name
of
the
boat
embroidered
in
the
field
of
blue
on
one
side
while
the
stars
were
on
the
other
we
all
admired
these
flags
greatly
especially
as
they
had
been
made
by
thompson
own
hands
we
had
with
us
a
diary
which
jack
sumner
had
kept
on
the
former
voyage
and
the
casual
way
in
which
he
repeatedly
referred
to
running
through
a
hell
of
foam
gave
us
an
inkling
if
nothing
more
of
what
was
coming
our
careful
preparations
gave
us
a
feeling
of
security
against
disaster
or
at
least
induced
us
to
expect
some
degree
of
liberality
from
fortune
we
had
done
our
best
to
insure
success
and
could
go
forward
in
some
confidence
a
delay
was
caused
by
the
of
some
extra
heavy
oars
ordered
from
chicago
but
at
length
they
came
and
it
was
well
we
waited
for
the
lighter
ones
were
quickly
found
to
be
too
frail
our
preparations
had
taken
three
weeks
considering
that
we
were
obliged
to
provide
against
every
contingency
that
might
occur
in
descending
this
torrent
so
completely
locked
in
from
assistance
and
supplies
the
time
was
not
too
long
below
green
river
city
wyoming
where
we
were
to

there
was
not
a
single
settler
nor
a
settlement
of
any
kind
on
or
near
the
river
for
a
distance
of
more
than
a
thousand
miles
from
the
river
out
a
hundred
miles
in
an
air
line
westward
across
a
practically
trackless
region
would
be
required
to
measure
the
distance
to
the
nearest
mormon
settlements
on
the
sevier
while
eastward
it
was
more
than
twice
as
far
to
the
few
pioneers
who
had
crossed
the
backbone
of
the
continent
the
uinta
indian
agency
was
the
nearest
establishment
to
green
river
it
was
forty
miles
west
of
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
in
southern
utah
the
newly
formed
mormon
settlement
of
kanab
offered
the
next
haven
but
no
one
understood
exactly
its
relationship
to
the
topography
of
the
colorado
except
from
the
vicinity
of
the
crossing
of
the
fathers
thus
the
country
through
which
we
were
to
pass
was
then
a
real
wilderness
while
the
river
itself
was
walled
in
for
almost
the
entire
way
by
more
or
less
unscalable
cliffs
of
great
height
finally
all
of
our
preparations
were
completed
to
the
last
detail
the
cabins
of
the
boats
were
packed

a

a
wooden
was
obtained
from

fastened

the
major

side
of

the
great

with

that
was
inspiring
to
enable
us
to
pick
up
the
last
ends
more
easily
and
to
make
our
departure
in
general
more
convenient
we
had
breakfast
that
morning
at
field
outfitting
place
and
an
excellent
breakfast
it
was
it
was
further
distinguished
by
being
the
last
meal
that
we
should
eat
at
a
table
for
many
a
month
we
were
followed
to
the
cove
where
our
loaded
boats
were
moored
by
a
number
of
people
about
the
whole
population
in
fact
and
that
did
not
make
a
crowd
none
of
the
chinamen
came
down
and
there
were
no
indians
in
town
that
day
the
only
unpleasant
circumstance
was
the
persistent
repetition
by
a
of
a
pantomimic
representation
of
the
disaster
that
he
believed
was
to
overwhelm
us
dummy
as
we
called
him
showed
us
that
we
would
be
upset
and
unable
to
scale
the
cliffs
would
surely
all
be
drowned
this
picture
as
vividly
presented
as
possible
seemed
to
give
him
and
his
brother
great
satisfaction
we
laughed
at
his
prophecy
but
his
efforts
to
talk
were
distressing
it
may
be
said
in
excuse
for
him
that
in
some
paddling
up
the
river
from
that
point
he
had
arrived
at
perhaps
an
honest
conviction
of
what
would
happen
to
any
one
going
below
and
also
that
other
wise
men
of
the
town
predicted
that
we
would
never
see
brown
hole
at
the
end
of
red
canyon
at
ten
we
pushed
out
into
the
current
there
were
and
from
the
shore
with
a
cheer
and
we
responded
with
three
and
then
we
passed
out
of
sight
the
settlement
the
railway
the
people
were
gone
the
magnificent
wilderness
was
ours
we
swept
down
with
a
current
between
rather
low
banks
using
the
oars
mainly
for
guidance
and
meeting
no
difficulty
worse
than
a
shoal
on
which
the
boats
all
grounded
for
a
few
moments
and
the
breaking
of
his
oar
by
jones
who
steered
our
boat
about
noon
having
run
three
miles
a
landing
was
made
on
a
broad
gravelly
island
to
enable
andy
to
concoct
a
dinner
a
heavy
gale
was
tearing
fiercely
across
the
bleak
spot
the
sand
flew
in
stinging
clouds
but
we
got
a
fire
started
and
then
it
burned
like
a
furnace
andy
made
another
sample
of
his
biscuits
this
time
liberally
incorporated
with
sand
and
he
fried
some
bacon
the
sand
mainly
settled
to
the
bottom
of
the
frying
pan
for
this
bacon
was
no
fancy
breakfast
table
variety
but
was
clear
fat
three
or
four
inches
thick
but
how
good
it
was
and
the
grease
poured
on
bread
and
yet
while
at
the
railway
i
had
scorned
it
in
fact
i
had
even
declared
that
i
would
never
touch
it
whereat
the
others
only
smiled
a
grim
and
confident
smile
and
now
at
the
first
noon
camp
i
was
ready
to
pronounce
it
one
of
the
greatest
delicacies
i
had
ever
tasted
they
jeered
at
me
but
their
jeers
were
kind
friendly
jeers
and
i
recall
them
with
pleasure
in
companionship
no
set
of
men
that
i
have
ever
since
been
associated
with
has
been
superior
to
these
fellow
voyageurs
and
the
major
big
way
of
treating
things
has
been
a
lesson
all
my
life
we
had
all
become
fast
true
friends
at
once
with
the
exception
of
the
major
whom
i
had
first
met
about
two
months
before
and
frank
whom
i
had
known
for
a
year
or
two
i
had
been
acquainted
with
them
only
since
we
had
met
on
the
train
on
the
way
out
in
the
scant
shelter
of
some
greasewood
bushes
we
devoured
the
repast
which
the
morning
exercise
and
the
crisp
air
had
made
so
welcome
and
each
drank
several
cups
of
tea
dipped
from
the
wherein
andy
had
boiled
it
we
had
no
formal
table
when
all
was
ready
the
magic
words
well
go
fur
it
boys
which
andy
uttered
stepping
back
from
the
fire
were
ceremony
enough
each
man
took
a
tin
plate
and
a
cup
and
served
himself
clem
and
frank
were
sent
back
overland
to
the
town
for
a
box
of
thermometers
forgotten
and
for
an
extra
steering
oar
left
behind
and
the
waited
for
their
return
during
the
afternoon
as
we
glided
on
the
hills
began
to
close
in
upon
us
and
occasionally
the
river
would
cut
into
one
making
a
high
precipitous
wall

of
the
character
of

at
the
bow
oars
the
second
in
line
was
the
professor
thompson
steering
steward
rowing
aft
captain
bishop
forward
and
frank
richardson
sitting
rather
uncomfortably
on
the
middle
deck
the
third
and
last
boat
was
the
which
beaman
the
photographer
steered
while
andrew
hattan
rowed
aft
and
clement
powell
assistant
photographer
forward
this
order
was
preserved
with
a
few
exceptions
throughout
the
first
season
work
it
was
the
duty
of
and
jones
to
make
a
traverse
or
meander
of
the
river
as
we
descended
they
were
to
sight
ahead
at
each
bend
with
prismatic
compasses
and
make
estimates
of
the
length
of
each
sight
height
of
walls
width
of
stream
and
cap
was
to
put
the
results
on
paper
the
major
on
his
first
boat
kept
a
general
lookout
and
gave
commands
according
to
circumstances
he
remembered
the
general
character
of
the
river
from
his
former
descent
but
he
had
to
be
on
the
as
to
details
besides
every
stage
of
water
makes
a
change
in
the
nature
of
the
river
at
every
point
in
addition
to
this
outlook
the
major
kept
an
eye
on
the
geology
as
he
was
chief
geologist
and
steward
being
assistant
geologist
did
the
same
richardson
was
assistant
to
steward
jack
was
general
assistant
and
afterwards
photographer
i
was
artist
and
later
assistant
topographer
also
it
was
my
duty
to
make
any
sketch
that
the
geologists
might
want
and
of
course
as
in
the
case
of
everybody
to
help
in
the
navigation
or
anything
else
that
came
along
each
man
had
a
rifle
and
some
had
also
revolvers
most
of
the
rifles
were
winchesters
we
had
plenty
of
ammunition
and
the
rifles
were
generally
kept
where
we
could
get
at
them
quickly
in
this
order
and
with
these
duties
we
ran
on
down
the
green
and
so
far
at
least
as
i
was
concerned
feeling
as
if
we
had
suddenly
stepped
off
into
another
world
late
in
the
afternoon
we
were
astonished
to
discover
a
solitary
old
man
sitting
on
the
right
bank
fishing
who
he
was
we
did
not
know
but
we
gave
him
a
cheer
as
we
dashed
by
and
were
carried
beyond
his
surprised
vision
as
the
sun
began
to
reach
the
horizon
a
lookout
was
kept
for
a
good
place
for
camp
i
for
one
was
deeply
interested
as
i
had
never
yet
slept
in
the
open
at
length
we
reached
a
spot
where
the
hills
were
some
distance
back
on
the
right
leaving
quite
a
bottom
where
there
were
a
number
of
cottonwood
trees
a
deserted
log
cabin
silently
invited
us
to
land
and
as
this
was
cordial
for
the
wilderness
we
responded
in
the
affirmative
the
sky
had
a
look
of
storm
about
it
and
i
was
glad
of
even
this
excuse
for
a
roof
though
the
cabin
was
too
small
to
shelter
our
whole
party
except
standing
up
and
the
beds
were
all
put
down
on
the
ground
outside
the
night
was
very
cold
and
the
fire
which
we
made
for
andy
operations
was
most
comforting
we
had
for
supper
another
instalment
of
bacon
and
tea
which
tasted
just
as
good
as
had
that
prepared
at
noon
sitting
on
rocks
and
stumps
we
ate
this
meal
and
presently
the
raw
air
reminded
some
of
the
smokers
that
while
they
had
thrown
their
tobacco
away
there
was
in
the
boats
the
quite
large
supply
designed
for
our
red
friends
should
we
meet
any
of
course
we
had
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
for
them
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
pipes
which
had
been
cast
away
at
green
river
appeared
well
filled
and
burning
perhaps
we
had
pipes
for
the
indians
too
i
had
not
thrown
my
pipe
away
for
it
was
a
beautifully
carved
meerschaum
a
present
i
knew
just
where
it
was
and
lighted
it
up
though
i
was
not
a
great
smoker
the
indians
did
not
get
as
much
of
that
tobacco
as
they
might
have
wished
to
make
our
blankets
go
farther
we
bunked
together
two
and
two
and
jones
and
i
were
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
go
to
sleep
i
kept
studying
the
sky
watching
the
stars
through
the
ragged
breaks
in
the
flying
clouds
the
night
was
silent
after
the
gale
the
river
flowed
on
with
little
noise
the
fire
flickered
and
flickered
and
the
cottonwoods
appeared
dark
and
strange
as
i
finally
went
to
sleep
i
had
not
been
long
in
that
happy
state
before
i
saw
some
men
trying
to
steal
our
boats
on
which
our
lives
depended
and
i
immediately
attacked
them
pinning
one
to
the
ground
it
was
only
jones
i
was
holding
down
and
his
shouts
and
struggles
to
reach
his
pistol
woke
me
and
startled
the
camp
he
believed
a
real
enemy
was
on
him
there
was
a
laugh
at
my
expense
and
then
sleep
ruled
again
till
about
daylight
when
i
was
roused
by
rain
falling
on
my
face
all
were
soon
up
the
rain
changed
to
snow
which
fell
so
heavily
that
we
were
driven
to
the
cabin
where
a
glorious
fire
was
made
on
the
hearth
and
by
it
andy
got
the
bread
and
bacon
and
coffee
ready
for
breakfast
and
also
for
dinner
for
the
snow
was
so
thick
we
could
not
venture
on
the
river
till
it
stopped
and
that
was
not
till
afternoon
the
country
through
which
we
now
passed
was
more
broken
cliffs
buttes
mesas
were
everywhere
sometimes
we
were
between
high
rocky
banks
then
we
saw
a
valley
several
miles
wide
always
without
a
sign
of
occupation
by
white
men
even
though
as
yet
we
were
not
far
from
the
railway
in
a
direct
course
very
late
in
the
afternoon
we
saw
something
moving
in
the
distance
on
the
right
our
glasses
made
it
out
to
be
two
or
three
men
on
horseback
a
signal
was
made
which
they
saw
and
consequently
stopped
to
await
developments
and
a
bag
of
fossils
the
major
had
collected
was
sent
out
to
them
with
a
request
to
take
it
to
green
river
station
in
which
direction
they
were
headed
they
proved
to
be
a
party
of
prospectors
who
agreed
to
deliver
the
fossils
and
we
went
on
our
way
the
mornings
and
evenings
were
very
cold
and
frosty
but
during
the
day
the
temperature
was
perfectly
comfortable
and
this
was
gratifying
for
the
river
in
places
spread
into
several
channels
so
that
no
one
of
them
was
everywhere
deep
enough
for
the
boats
which
drew
so
heavily
laden
sixteen
or
eighteen
inches
the
keels
grated
frequently
on
the
bottom
and
we
had
to
jump
overboard
to
lighten
the
boats
and
pull
them
off
into
deep
water
we
found
as
we
went
on
that
we
must
be
ready
every
moment
in
all
kinds
of
water
to
get
over
into
the
river
and
it
was
necessary
to
do
so
with
our
clothes
on
including
our
shoes
for
the
reason
that
the
rocky
bottom
would
bruise
and
cut
our
feet
without
the
shoes
rocks
would
do
the
same
to
our
legs
and
for
the
further
reason
that
there
was
no
time
to
remove
garments
in
the
rapids
further
on
we
always
shipped
water
and
consequently
we
were
wet
from
this
cause
most
of
the
time
anyhow
we
had
two
suits
of
clothes
one
for
wear
on
the
river
in
the
day
time
and
the
other
for
evening
in
camp
the
latter
being
kept
in
a
rubber
bag
so
that
we
always
managed
to
be
dry
and
warm
at
night
on
making
camp
the
day
suit
was
spread
out
on
rocks
or
on
a
branch
of
a
tree
if
one
were
near
or
on
a
bush
to
dry
and
it
was
generally
though
not
always
comfortably
so
in
the
morning
when
it
was
again
put
on
for
the
river
work
sometimes
being
still
damp
the
sensation
for
a
few
moments
was
not
agreeable
we
snapped
several
of
the
lighter
oars
in
the
cross
currents
as
the
boats
were
heavy
and
did
not
mind
quickly
and
to
backwater
suddenly
on
one
of
the
slender
oars
broke
it
like
a
reed
some
of
the
longer
heavier
oars
were
then
cut
down
to
eight
feet
and
were
found
to
be
entirely
serviceable
the
steering
oars
were
cut
down
from
eighteen
to
sixteen
feet
extra
oars
were
carried
slung
on
each
side
of
the
boats
just
under
the
gunwales
for
the
major
on
the
former
journey
had
been
much
hampered
by
being
obliged
to
halt
to
search
for
timber
suitable
for
oars
and
then
to
make
them
there
was
one
thing
about
the
boats
which
we
soon
discovered
was
a
mistake
this
was
the
lack
of
iron
on
the
keels
the
iron
had
been
left
off
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
the
weight
when
it
should
be
necessary
to
carry
the
boats
around
bad
places
but
the
rocks
and
gravel
cut
the
keels
down
alarmingly
till
there
was
danger
of
wearing
out
the
bottoms
in
the
long
voyage
to
come
jack
was
a
great
fisherman
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
tried
his
luck
in
the
waters
of
the
green
no
one
knew
what
kind
of
fish
might
be
taken
at
least
no
one
in
our
party
and
he
began
his
fishing
with
some
curiosity
it
was
rewarded
by
a
species
of
fish
none
of
us
had
ever
before
seen
a
fish
about
ten
to
sixteen
inches
long
slim
with
fine
scales
and
large
fins
their
heads
came
down
with
a
sudden
curve
to
the
mouth
and
their
bodies
tapered
off
to
a
very
small
circumference
just
before
the
tail
spread
out
they
were
good
to
eat
and
formed
a
welcome
addition
to
our
larder
we
were
all
eager
for
something
fresh
and
when
we
saw
a
couple
of
deer
run
across
the
bluffs
just
before
we
reached
our
fourth
camp
our
hopes
of
venison
were
roused
to
a
high
degree
camp
number
four
was
opposite
the
mouth
of
black
fork
at
an
altitude
above
sea
level
of
feet
a
descent
of
feet
from
the
railway
bridge
after
this
the
channel
was
steadier
and
the
water
deeper
black
fork
being
one
of
the
largest
tributaries
of
the
upper
river
we
now
came
in
view
of
the
snowy
line
of
the
uinta
range
stretching
east
and
west
across
our
route
and
adding
a
beautiful
alpine
note
to
the
wide
barren
array
of
cliffs
and
buttes
it
was
twenty
or
thirty
miles
off
but
so
clear
was
the
air
that
we
seemed
to
be
almost
upon
it
as
we
were
drifting
along
with
a
swift
current
in
the
afternoon
the
day
after
passing
black
fork
one
of
the
party
saw
a
deer
on
an
island
a
rifle
shot
from
our
boat
missed
and
the
animal
dashing
into
the
river
swam
across
and
disappeared
in
the
wide
valley
but
another
was
seen
a
landing
was
made
immediately
and
while
some
of
the
men
held
the
boats
ready
to
pick
up
a
prize
the
others
beat
the
island
i
was
assigned
to
man
our
boat
and
as
we
waited
up
against
the
bank
under
the
bushes
we
could
hear
the
rifles
crack
then
all
was
still
suddenly
i
heard
a
crashing
of
bushes
and
a
hundred
yards
above
us
a
superb
sprang
into
the
water
and
swam
for
the
east
bank
my
sensation
was
divided
between
a
desire
to
see
the
deer
escape
and
a
desire
to
supplant
the
bacon
with
venison
for
a
time
my
cartridges
were
under
the
hatches
as
it
chanced
so
i
was
unable
to
take
action
myself
with
deep
interest
i
watched
the
animal
swim
and
with
regret
that
our
fresh
meat
was
so
fortunate
for
it
was
of
the
way
across
before
a
rifle
cracked
the
deer
efforts
ceased
instantly
and
she
began
to
drift
down
with
the
current
we
ran
our
boat
out
and
hauled
the
carcass
on
board
at
the
same
time
as
we
were
being
carried
down
by
the
swift
current
we
got
a
view
of
the
other
side
of
the
island
where
cap
up
to
his
arms
in
the
stream
was
trying
to
pull
another
deer
ashore
by
the
horns
it
looked
as
if
both
deer
and
cap
would
sail
away
and
forever
till
another
boat
went
to
his
rescue
presently
the
third
boat
came
down
bearing
still
another
deer
the
successful
shots
were
from
andy
and
steward
our
prospects
for
a
feast
were
bright
and
we
had
it
the
deer
were
speedily
dressed
frank
displaying
exceptional
skill
in
this
line
had
we
been
able
to
stay
in
this
region
we
would
never
have
been
in
want
of
fresh
meat
but
when
we
entered
the
canyons
the
conditions
were
so
different
and
the
task
of
pursuing
game
so
baffling
and
exhausting
that
we
never
had
such
success
again
the
whole
of
the
next
day
we
remained
in
a
favourable
spot
at
the
foot
of
a
strangely
tilted
ledge
where
we
jerked
the
venison
by
the
aid
of
sun
and
fire
to
preserve
it
near
this
point
as
observations
showed
later
we
passed
from
wyoming
into
utah
about
dusk
we
were
surprised
to
discover
a
small
craft
with
a
single
individual
aboard
coming
down
the
river
then
we
saw
it
was
a
raft
we
watched
its
approach
with
deep
interest
wondering
who
the
stranger
could
be
but
he
turned
out
to
be
steward
who
had
gone
geologising
and
had
taken
this
easier
means
of
coming
back
he
tried
it
again
farther
down
and
met
with
an
experience
which
taught
him
to
trust
to
the
land

the
next
day
our
boat
was
held
back
for
some
special
work
while
the
others
proceeded
toward
a
high
spur
of
the
uintas
directly
in
front
of
us
we
followed
with
a
fierce
and
blinding
gale
sweeping
the
river
and
filling
our
eyes
with
sharp
sand
nevertheless
we
could
see
high
up
before
us
some
bright
red
rocks
marking
the
first
canyon
of
the
wonderful
series
that
separates
this
river
from
the
common
world
from
these
bright
rocks
glowing
in
the
sunlight
like
a
flame
above
the
of
the
ridge
the
major
had
bestowed
on
this
place
the
name
of
flaming
gorge
as
we
passed
down
towards
the
mountain
it
seemed
that
the
river
surely
must
end
there
but
suddenly
just
below
the
mouth
of
henry
fork
it
doubled
to
the
left
and
we
found
ourselves
between
two
low
cliffs
then
in
a
moment
we
dashed
to
the
right
into
the
beautiful
canyon
with
the
cliffs
whose
summit
we
had
seen
rising
about
feet
on
the
right
and
a
steep
slope
on
the
left
at
the
base
of
which
was
a
small
bottom
covered
with
tall
cottonwood
trees
whose
green
shone
resplendent
against
the
red
rocks
the
other
boats
were
swinging
at
their
lines
and
the
smoke
of
andy
fire
whirling
on
the
wind
was
a
cheerful
sight
to
the
constant
exercise
in
the
open
air
produces
a
constant
appetite
as
long
as
we
could
protect
our
cargoes
and
make
our
connections
with
our
supplies
as
planned
we
would
surely
not
have
to
go
hungry
but
we
had
to
consider
that
there
was
room
for
some
variation
or
degree
of
success
there
was
at
least
one
comforting
feature
about
the
river
work
and
that
was
we
never
suffered
for
drinking
water
it
was
only
on
side
trips
away
from
the
river
that
we
met
this
difficulty
so
common
in
the
rocky
mountain
region
and
all
the
when
the
barometrical
observations
were
worked
out
we
found
we
had
now
descended
feet
from
our
that
was
four
and
a
quarter
feet
for
each
mile
of
the
we
had
put
behind
we
always
counted
the
miles
put
behind
for
we
knew
they
could
not
be
retraced
but
it
was
ever
the
miles
and
the
rapids
ahead
that
we
kept
most
in
our
minds
we
were
now
at
the
beginning
of
the
real
battle
with
the
sunken
river
henceforth
high
and
forbidding
cliffs
with
few
breaks
would
imprison
the
stream
on
both
sides
a
loss
of
our
provisions
would
mean
a
journey
on
foot
after
climbing
out
of
the
canyon
to

wyoming

camp
to

at

of
lodore
now
took
observations
for
time
and
latitude
in
order
to
fix
with
accuracy
the
geographical
location
of
the
camp
in
flaming
gorge
and
to
check
the
estimates
of
the
topographers
as
they
sighted
the
various
stretches
of
the
river
it
has
been
found
that
estimates
of
this
kind
are
quite
accurate
and
that
the
variation
from
exactness
is
generally
the
same
in
the
same
individual
hence
one
man
may
underestimate
and
another
may
overestimate
but
each
will
always
make
the
same
error
and
this
error
can
be
readily
corrected
by
frequent
observations
to
determine
latitude
and
longitude
a
series
of
barometrical
observations
was
kept
going
whether
we
were
on
the
move
or
not
that
is
a
mercurial
barometer
was
read
three
times
a
day
regularly
at
seven
at
one
and
at
nine
we
had
aneroid
barometers
for
work
away
from
the
river
and
these
were
constantly
compared
with
and
adjusted
to
the
mercurials
the
tubes
of
mercury
sometimes
got
broken
and
then
a
new
one
had
to
be
boiled
to
replace
it
i
believe
the
boiling
of
tubes
has
since
that
time
been
abandoned
as
there
is
not
enough
air
in
the
tube
to
interfere
with
the
action
of
the
mercury
but
at
that
time
it
was
deemed
necessary
for
accuracy
and
it
gave
endless
trouble
the
wind
was
always
blowing
and
no
tent
we
could
contrive
from
blankets
and
waggon
sheets
we
had
no
regular
tents
sufficed
to
keep
the
flame
of
the
alcohol
lamp
from
flickering
nevertheless
whose
patience
and
dexterity
were
unlimited
always
succeeded
the
mercurial
barometers
were
of
the
kind
with
a
buckskin
pocket
at
the
bottom
of
the
cistern
with
a
screw
for
adjusting
the
column
of
mercury
to
a
fixed
point
most
of
the
men
climbed
out
in
various
directions
and
for
various
objects
reached
a
high
altitude
whence
he
obtained
a
broad
view
of
the
country
a
grand
sight
with
the
quiet
river
below
and
mountains
around
with
rolling
smoke
and
leaping
flame
for
there
were
great
mountain
fires
not
far
off
the
major
and
steward
went
geologising
steward
was
rewarded
by
discovering
a
number
of
fossils
among
them
the
bones
of
an
immense
animal
of
the
world
early
day
with
a
femur
ten
inches
in
diameter
and
ribs
two
inches
thick
and
six
inches
wide
these
bones
were
much
exposed
and
could
have
been
dug
out
but
we
had
no
means
of
transporting
them
flaming
gorge
is
an
easy
place
to
get
in
and
out
of
even
with
a
horse
and
doubtless
in
the
old
days
it
was
a
favourite
resort
of
trappers
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
double
turn
of
the
swirling
river
where
it
enters
flaming
gorge
is
the
place
known
at
that
time
as
the
green
river
suck
our
camp
under
the
cottonwoods
was
delightful
we
took
advantage
of
the
halt
to
write
up
notes
clean
guns
mend
clothes
do
our
washing
and
all
the
other
little
things
incident
to
a
breathing
spell
on
a
voyage
of
this
kind
it
was
sunday
too
and
when
possible
we
stopped
on
that
account
though
of
course
progress
could
not
be
deferred
for
that
reason
alone
monday
morning
we
left
the
pleasant
camp
in
the
grove
and
went
on
with
the
tide
the
river
was
rough
from
a
heavy
gale
but
otherwise
offered
no
obstacle
at
a
sudden
bend
we
cut
to
the
left
deeper
into
the
mountain
till
on
both
sides
we
were
enclosed
by
almost
perpendicular
precipices
of
carboniferous
formation
limestone
about
feet
high
the
canyon
was
surprisingly
beautiful
and
romantic
the
river
seemed
to
change
its
mood
here
and
began
to
flow
with
an
impetus
it
had
exhibited
nowhere
above
it
swept
on
with
a
directness
and
a
concentration
of
purpose
that
had
about
it
something
ominous
and
just
here
at
the
foot
of
the
right
hand
wall
which
was
perpendicular
for
feet
with
the
left
more
sloping
and
clothed
with
cedar
shrubs
we
beheld
our
first
real
rapid
gleaming
like
a
jewel
from
its
setting
in
the
sunlight
which
fell
into
the
gorge
and
it
had
as
majestic
a
setting
as
could
be
desired
for
myself
i
can
say
that
the
place
appeared
the
acme
of
the
romantic
and
picturesque
the
rapid
was
small
and
swift
a
mere
chute
and
perhaps
hardly
worthy
of
mention
had
it
not
been
the
point
where
the
character
of
the
river
current
changes
making
it
distinguished
because
of
being
the
first
of
hundreds
to
come
below
the
river
above
had
held
a
continual
descent
accelerating
here
and
retarding
there
with
an
average
current
of
two
and
a
half
miles
an
hour
but
here
began
the
quick
drops
for
which
the
canyons
are
now
famous
there
was
one
place
where
noted
a
small
rapid
but
it
was
not
like
this
one
and
i
did
not
count
it
at
all
illustration
horseshoe

photograph
by
beaman
the
gorge
we
ran
into
so
suddenly
was
short
and
by
we
had
emerged
into
a
wider
more
broken
place
though
we
were
still
bound
in
by
tremendous
heights
we
saw
that
we
had
described
a
complete
horseshoe
and
this
fact
determined
the
canyon
name
number
two
of
the
series
when
we
landed
for
dinner
an
examination
was
made
of
the
locality
from
that
base
before
we
dropped
down
a
little
distance
to
the
mouth
of
a
fine
clear
creek
coming
in
from
the
right
this
was
a
fascinating
place
the
great
slopes
were
clothed
with
verdure
and
trees
and
the
creek
ran
through
luxuriant
vegetation
a
halt
of
a
day
was
made
for
observation
purposes
the
air
was
full
of
kingfishers
darting
about
and
we
immediately
called
the
creek
by
their
name
i
was
sent
with
steward
on
a
geological
expedition
out
over
the
right
or
western
cliffs
we
consumed
two
hours
in
getting
out
having
to
climb
up
about
feet
over
a
difficult
way
after
a
good
deal
of
going
up
and
down
across
rough
ridges
we
finally
worked
our
way
around
to
the
head
of
flaming
gorge
here
we
reckoned
up
and
found
that
eight
steep
ridges
intervened
between
us
and
camp
by
the
way
we
had
come
and
we
concluded
that
we
could
get
back
easier
through
flaming
gorge
and
thence
by
climbing
over
the
tongue
or
base
of
the
horseshoe
which
was
lower
than
the
end
steward
grew
decidedly
weary
and
i
felt
my
legs
getting
heavy
too
rain
had
fallen
at
intervals
all
day
and
we
were
wet
as
well
as
tired
and
famished
we
struck
an
old
trail
and
followed
it
as
long
as
it
went
our
way
then
it
became
too
dark
to
see
which
way
it
went
and
we
climbed
on
as
best
we
could
it
was
about
eight
when
we
reached
our
camp
to
find
a
splendid
fire
burning
and
a
good
supper
waiting
for
us
the
new
canyon
which
closed
in
the
next
day
had
walls
about
feet
in
height
that
being
the
general
height
of
the
spur
of
the
uintas
through
which
we
were
travelling
the
changes
from
one
canyon
to
another
were
only
changes
in
the
character
of
the
bounding
mountain
walls
for
there
was
no
break
into
open
country
the
name
of
kingfisher
we
gave
to
the
new
gorge
for
the
same
reason
we
had
called
the
creek
at
our
camp
by
that
name
and
so
numerous
were
these
birds
at
one
rounded
promontory
that
there
was
no
escape
from
calling
it
beehive
point
the
resemblance
to
a
gigantic
hive
being
perfect
kingfisher
canyon
like
its
two
predecessors
was
short
all
three
making
a
distance
by
the
river
of
only
about
ten
miles

is
the

the

and
kingfisher
the
to
the
whole
grand
series
at
the
foot
of
kingfisher
the
rocks
fell
back
a
little
and
steep
slopes
took
their
place
where
the
rocks
closed
in
again
we
halted
on
the
threshold
of
the
next
gorge
in
a
fine
grove
of
cottonwoods
a
significant
roar
came
to
us
out
of
the
gate
to
red
canyon
rolling
up
on
the
air
with
a
steady
unvarying
monotony
that
had
a
sinister
meaning
it
was
plain
that
we
were
nearing
something
that
was
no
paltry
gem
like
the
rapid
we
had
so
much
admired
in
horseshoe
canyon
the
remainder
of
that
day
and
all
the
next
which
was
june
we
stayed
at
this
camp
completing
records
investigating
the
surroundings
and
preparing
for
rough
work
ahead
on
friday
morning
the
cabins
were
packed
carefully
the
life
preservers
were
inflated
and
we
pulled
out
into
the
current
the
cliffs
shot
up
around
us
and
rough
water
began
at
once
the
descent
was
almost
continuous
for
a
considerable
distance
but
we
divided
it
into
three
rapids
in
our
notes
before
we
reached
a
sharp
turn
to
the
right
and
then
one
just
as
sharp
to
the
left
with
vertical
walls
on
both
sides
and
a
roaring
torrent
broken
by
rocks
whirling
between
our
boat
shot
down
with
fierce
rapidity
and
would
have
gone
through
without
a
mishap
had
not
the
current
dashed
us
so
close
to
the
wall
that
jack
starboard
was
ripped
off
by
a
projection
of
the
cliff
as
we
were
hurled
along
its
rugged
base
at
the
same
moment
we
saw
the
upsetting
against
some
rocks
on
the
left
then
we
swept
out
of
view
and
i
was
obliged
to
pull
with
all
my
strength
jack
one
oar
being
useless
we
succeeded
in
gaining
a
little
cove
on
the
left
and
jumped
out
as
soon
as
shallow
enough
the
major
immediately
climbing
the
cliffs
to
a
high
point
where
he
could
look
down
on
the
unfortunate
second
boat
it
seems
had
misunderstood
the
major
signal
and
had
done
just
what
he
did
not
think
he
ought
to
do
he
thought
it
meant
to
land
on
the
left
and
he
had
tried
to
reach
a
small
strip
of
beach
but
finding
this
was
not
possible
he
turned
the
boat
again
into
the
current
to
retrieve
his
former
position
but
this
was
not
successful
and
the
was
thrown
on
some
rocks
projecting
from
the
left
wall
in
the
midst
of
wild
waters
striking
hard
enough
to
crush
some
upper
planks
of
the
port
side
she
immediately
rolled
over
and
frank
slid
under
clutched
him
and
pulled
him
back
while
the
men
all
sprang
for
the
rocks
and
saved
themselves
and
the
boat
from
being
washed
away
in
this
demoralised
condition
with
marvellous
celerity
cap
took
a
turn
with
a
rope
around
a
small
tree
which
he
managed
to
reach
while
steward
jumped
to
a
position
where
he
could
prevent
the
boat
from
pounding
in
a
minute
she
was
righted
and
they
got
her
to
the
little
beach
where
they
had
tried
to
land
here
they
pulled
her
out
and
partially
unloading
repaired
her
temporarily
as
well
as
they
could
this
done
they
towed
up
to
a
point
of
vantage
and
made
a
fresh
start
and
cleared
the
rapid
with
no
further
incident
meanwhile
the
had
come
in
to
where
we
were
lying
and
both
boats
were
held
ready
to
rescue
the
men
of
the
other
after
about
of
an
hour
the
unfortunate
came
down
her
crew
being
rather
elated
over
the
experience
and
the
distinction
of
having
the
first
capsize
setting
out
on
the
current
again
we
passed
two
beautiful
creeks
entering
from
the
right
and
they
were
immediately
named
respectively
compass
and
kettle
creeks
to
commemorate
the
loss
of
these
articles
in
the
capsize
at
the
mouth
of
kettle
creek
about
a
mile
and
a
half
below
the
capsize
rapid
we
stopped
for
dinner
then
running
several
small
drops
we
arrived
at
a
long
descent
that
compelled
careful
action
we
always
landed
where
possible
to
make
an
examination
and
learn
the
trend
of
the
main
current
our
not
being
able
to
do
this
above
was
the
cause
of
the
trouble
we
now
saw
that
we
had
here
landed
on
the
wrong
side
and
would
have
to
make
a
somewhat
hazardous
crossing
to
the
opposite
or
right
bank
our
boat
tried
it
first
in
spite
of
vigorous
pulling
we
were
carried
faster
down
towards
the
rapid
than
to
the
objective
landing
when
we
reached
water
about
waist
deep
we
all
sprang
overboard
and
i
got
to
shore
with
the
line
as
quickly
as
i
could
we
were
able
to
turn
and
catch
the
as
she
came
in
but
the
following
ran
too
far
down
we
all
dashed
into
the
stream
almost
at
the
head
of
the
rapid
and
there
caught
her
in
time
the
load
was
taken
out
of
our
boat
and
she
was
let
down
by
lines
over
the
worst
part
loading
again
we
lowered
to
another
bad
place
where
we
went
into
camp
on
the
same
spot
where
the
major
had
camped
two
years
before
we
unloaded
the
other
boats
and
got
them
down
before
dark
but
we
ate
supper
by
firelight
the
river
averaged
about
feet
wide
with
a
current
of
not
less
than
six
miles
an
hour
and
waves
in
the
rapids
over
five
feet
in
vertical
height
these
waves
broke
up
stream
as
waves
do
in
a
swift
current
and
as
the
boats
cut
into
them
at
a
high
velocity
we
shipped
quantities
of
water
and
were
constantly
drenched
especially
the
the
cliffs
on
each
side
wonderfully
picturesque
soon
ran
up
to
or
feet
and
steadily
increased
their
altitude
owing
to
the
dip
of
the
strata
across
the
east
and
west
trend
of
the
canyon
the
walls
on
the
north
were
steeper
than
those
on
the
south
but
they
seldom
rose
vertically
from
the
river
masses
of
talus
and
often
alluvial
stretches
with
rocks
and
trees
were
strung
along
their
base
usually
offering
numerous
excellent
landings
and
camping
places
we
were
able
to
stop
about
as
we
wished
and
had
no
trouble
as
to
camps
though
they
were
frequently
not
just
what
we
would
have
preferred
there
was
always
smooth
sand
to
sleep
on
and
often
plenty
of
willows
to
cut
and
lay
in
rows
for
a
mattress
it
must
not
be
imagined
that
these
great
canyons
are
dark
and
gloomy
in
the
daytime
they
are
no
more
so
than
an
ordinary
city
street
flanked
with
very
high
buildings
some
lateral
canyons
are
narrow
and
so
deep
that
the
sun
enters
them
but
briefly
but
even
these
are
only

we
remained
on
the
major
old
camp
ground
a
day
so
that
jones
and
cap
could
climb
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
to
get
the
topography
the
next
morning
though
it
was
sunday
was
not
to
be
one
of
rest
we
began
by
lowering
the
boats
about
forty
rods
farther
and
there
pulled
out
into
the
stream
and
were
dashed
along
by
a
fierce
current
with
rapid
following
rapid
closely
the
descent
was
nearly
continuous
with
greater
declivities
thrown
in
here
and
there
as
usual
we
took
in
a
good
deal
of
water
and
were
saturated
we
were
growing
accustomed
to
this
and
the
boats
being
built
to
float
even
when
the
open
parts
were
full
we
did
not
mind
sitting
with

in

through
it
easily
hook
had
declared
that
if
powell
could
descend
the
river
he
could
too
and
he
headed
a
party
to
follow
the
motive
i
believe
was
prospecting
i
do
not
know
how
far
they
expected
to
go
but
this
was
as
far
as
they
got
their
abandoned
boats
and
inadequate
still
lay
half
buried
in
sand
on
the
bank
and
not
far
off
on
a
sandy
knoll
was
the
grave
of
the
unfortunate
leader
marked
by
a
pine
board
set
up
with
his
name
painted
on
it
old
sacks
ropes
oars
emphasised
the
completeness
of
the
disaster
not
far
below
this
we
made
what
we
called
a
line
portage
that
is
the
boats
were
worked
along
the
edge
of
the
rapid
one
at
a
time
in
and
out
among
the
boulders
with
three
or
four
men
clinging
to
them
to
fend
them
off
the
rocks
and
several
more
holding
on
to
the
hawser
so
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
one
getting
loose
and
smashing
up
or
leaving
us
altogether
it
was
then
noon
and
a
camp
was
made
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
on
the
left
bank
in
a
very
comfortable
spot
we
had
accomplished
three
and
a
half
miles
with
four
distinct
rapids
run
and
one
i
went
up
from
the
camp
along
a
sandy
stretch
and
was
surprised
to
discover
what
i
took
to
be
the
fresh
print
of
the
bare
foot
of
a
man
mentioning
this
when
i
returned
my
companions
laughed
and
warned
me
to
be
cautious
and
give
this
strange
man
a
wide
berth
unless
i
had
my
rifle
and
plenty
of
ammunition
it
was
the
track
of
a
grizzly
bear
i
saw
many
tracks
on
this
expedition
and
on
others
afterwards
but
i
have
never
seen
a
bear
yet
except
in
captivity
the
grizzly
seemed
to
shun
me
but
i
believe
they
will
not
often
attack
a
man
unprovoked
and
will
lie
perfectly
still
while
one
may
pass
within
a
few
feet
of
their
three
or
four
deer
were
seen
but
with
no
opportunity
to
get
a
shot
all
through
these
upper
canyons
there
was
then
a
great
abundance
of
game
of
every
description
and
had
our
object
been
to
kill
for
sport
we
undoubtedly
could
have
made
a
pile
of
carcasses
one
or
two
deer
would
have
been
welcome
but
we
had
no
time
to
pursue
them
steward
came
in
towards
night
from
his
geologising
with
a
splendid
bouquet
of
wild
flowers
which
was
greatly
admired
and
the
major
climbed
west
of
camp
to
a
height
of
feet
where
they
obtained
a
wide
outlook
and
secured
valuable
notes
on
the
topography
the
view
was
superb
as
it
is
anywhere
from
a
high
point
in
this
region
when
they
came
back
the
major
entertained
us
by
reading
aloud
lay
of
the
last
thus
delightfully
closing
a
beautiful
sunday
which
every
man
had
enjoyed
in
the
morning
soon
after
leaving
this
camp
a
dull
roar
ahead
told
of
our
approach
to
ashley
falls
for
which
we
were
on
the
lookout
the
left
bank
was
immediately
hugged
as
closely
as
possible
and
we
dropped
cautiously
down
to
the
head
of
the
descent
an
immense
rock
stuck
up
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
the
water
divided
on
this
and
shot
down
on
each
side
in
a
sharp
fall
of
about
eight
feet
each
was
a
clear
chute
and
not
dangerous
to
look
at
but
the
effect
of
so
sudden
a
plunge
on
one
of
our
loaded
boats
was
too
much
of
a
problem
for
trial
a
portage
was
decided
on
the
left
bank
where
we
were
was
a
mass
of
enormous
broken
rocks
where
it
seemed
next
to
impossible
to
haul
a
boat
a
foot
trail
was
first
built
which
led
up
some
fifty
feet
above
the
river
and
over
under
and
around
huge
boulders
to
a
place
down
below
where
it
was
proposed
to
carry
the
boats
on
skids
the
cargoes
were
first
taken
over
on
our
backs
and
when
this
was
done
we
were
about
tired
out
our
united
strength
was
required
to
work
the
down
to
the
selected
haven
without
injury
this
was
such
extremely
hard
work
that
the
major
and
concluded
to
shoot
the
through
light
with
no
men
in
her
but
controlled
by
one
of
our
hawsers
attached
to
each
end
she
was
started
down
and
went
through
well
enough
but
filling
with
water
and
knocking
on
hidden
rocks
prudence
condemned
this
method
and
we
resorted
to
sliding
and
carrying
the
over
the
rocks
as
we
had
done
with
the
certain
that
sleep
and
food
would
wipe
out
our
weariness
but
not
injury
to
the
boats
which
must
be
avoided
by
all
means
in
our
power
by
the
time
we
had
placed
the
beside
the
other
boats
at
the
bottom
it
was
sunset
and
too
late
to
do
anything
but
make
a
camp
just
above
the
head
of
the
fall
was
a
rather
level
place
in
a
clump
of
pines
at
the
very
edge
of
the
river
forming
as
picturesque
a
as
i
have
ever
seen
a
brilliant
moon
hung
over
the
canyon
lighting
up
the
foam
of
the
water
in
strong
contrast
to
the
red
fire
crackling
its
accompaniment
to
the
roar
of
the
rapid
a
lunar
rainbow
danced
in
the
mists
rising
from
the
turmoil
of
the
river
the
night
air
was
calm
and
mild
read
aloud
from
and
it
seemed
to
fit
the
time
and
place
admirably
we
had
few
books
with
us
poems
of
longfellow
whittier
emerson
and
scott
are
all
i
remember
except
a
bible
my
mother
had
given
me
i
suppose
cap
had
a
bible
also
as
he
was
very
religious
the
huge
boulders
which
dammed
the
river
had
fallen
from
the
cliffs
on
the
left
within
a
comparatively
recent
time
transforming
an
ordinary
rapid
into
the
fall
actually
damming
the
water
till
it
is
smooth

half
a
mile

largest
block
of
stone

the
one

about
twenty
five

reach
this
place

other
party
was
general
ashley
the
distinguished
fur
trader
with
a
number
of
trappers
in
his
search
for
fresh
beaver
grounds
he
led
his
party
in
rude
boats
through
this
canyon
in
they
had
a
hard
time
and
nearly
starved
to
death
as
they
depended
for
food
on
finding
beaver
and
other
game
in
which
they
were
disappointed
on
one
of
my
trips
over
the
rocks
with
cargo
i
made
a
slight
detour
on
the
return
to
see
the
boulder
where
the
major
had
discovered
ashley
name
with
a
date
the
letters
were
in
black
just
under
a
slight
projection
and
were
surprisingly
distinct
considering
the
years
of
exposure
the
was
illegible
and
looked
like
a
none
of
our
party
seemed
to
know
that
it
could
have
been
only
a
for
by
the
year
ashley
had
sold
out
and
had
given
up
the
fur
business
in
the
mountains
considering
his
ability
his
prominence
his
high
character
and
his
identification
with
the
early
history
of
the
west
there
ought
to
be
greater
recognition
of
him
than
there
has
been

below
ashley
falls
the
declivity
of
the
river
was
very
great
with
a
correspondingly
swift
current
in
one
rapid
reaching
a
velocity
of
at
least
fifteen
miles
an
hour
and
with
waves
that
tossed
our
heavy
boats
like
feathers
these
were
the
most
violent
rapids
we
had
yet
met
not
excepting
the
ones
we
had
portaged
the
cliffs
about
feet
high
of
red
sandstone
were
often
almost
perpendicular
on
both
sides
or
at
least
they
impressed
us
so
at
the
time
there
was
much
vegetation
pine
spruce
cottonwood
aspens
alder
which
added
to
the
beauty
and
picturesqueness
of
the
wild
scenery
beaman
stopped
each
day
where
possible
and
desirable
to
take
photographs
and
at
these
times
the
others
investigated
the
surroundings
and
climbed
up
side
canyons
when
they
existed
late
in
the
afternoon
we
came
out
suddenly
into
a
small
valley
or
park
formerly
called
little
brown
hole
a
noted
rendezvous
for
trappers
and
which
we
rechristened
red
canyon
park
this
was
a
beautiful
place
bounded
by
round
mountains
into
which
our
great
cliffs
had
temporarily
resolved
themselves
particularly
on
the
right
the
left
side
remaining
pretty
steep
our
camp
was
pitched
under
two
large
pine
trees
and
every
one
was
prepared
in
the
intervals
of
other
duties
to
take
advantage
of
this
respite
to
patch
up
clothing
shoes
as
well
as
to
do
what
laundering
was
necessary
the
river
ran
so
quietly
that
we
felt
oppressed
after
the
constant
roaring
since
we
had
entered
red
canyon
i
remember
climbing
up
at
evening
with
one
of
my
companions
to
a
high
altitude
where
the
silence
was
deathlike
and
overpowering
and
some
of
the
others
climbed
to
greater
heights
for
topographical
purposes
easily
reaching
an
altitude
of
about
feet
above
the
river
in
an
distance
of
about
five
miles
here
they
obtained
a
magnificent
panorama
in
all
directions
limited
on
the
west
by
the
snowy
chain
of
the
wasatch
and
on
the
north
by
the
wind
river
range
like
white
clouds
on
the
horizon
miles
away
and
they
could
trace
the
deep
gorges
of
the
river
as
they
cleave
the
mountains
from
distance
to
distance
here
we
saw
signs
of
abundant
game
elk
deer
bear
but
we
had
no
time
to
go
hunting
as
a
business
and
the
game
refused
to
come
to
us
each
man
had
his
work
to
accomplish
so
that
we
could
get
on
it
was
impracticable
to
go
wandering
over
the
mountains
for
game
much
as
we
would
have
enjoyed
a
change
from
our
bacon
and
beans
one
day
only
was
spent
here
for
all
purposes
geologising
topographic
climbing
and
working
out
the
notes
from
up
the
river
making
repairs
and
all
the
other
needful
things
that
crowded
upon
us
here
it
was
that
i
did
my
first
tailoring
and
performed
a
feat
of
which
i
have
ever
since
been
proud
namely
transferring
some
coattails
from
where
they
were
of
no
use
to
the
knees
and
seat
of
my
trousers
where
they
were
invaluable
on
june
we
left
this
camp
number
regretfully
and
plunged
in
between
the
cliffs
again
for
about
eight
miles
running
five
rapids
when
we
emerged
into
a
large
valley
known
as
brown
hole
where
our
cliffs
fell
back
for
two
or
three
miles
on
each
side
and
became
mountain
ranges
pulling
along
for
a
couple
of
miles
on
a
quiet
river
we
were
surprised
to
discover
on
the
left
a
white
man
camp
quickly
landing
we
learned
that
it
was
some
cattlemen
temporary
headquarters
harrell
brothers
and
some
of
the
men
had
been
to
green
river
station
since
our
departure
from
that
place
the
distance
by
trail
not
being
half
that
by
river
they
were
expecting
us
and
had
brought
some
mail
which
was
a
glad
sight
for
our
eyes
these
men
had
wintered
about
head
of
texas
cattle
in
this
valley
noted
for
the
salubrity
of
its
winter
climate
since
the
days
of
the
and
were
on
their
way
to
the
pacific
coast
we
made
a
camp
near
by
with
a
cottonwood
of
a
peculiar
y
shape
more
stump
than
tree
to
give
what
it
could
and
enjoyed
the
relaxation
which
came
with
the
feeling
that
we
had
put
miles
of
hard
canyon
behind
and
were
again
in
touch
though
so
briefly
and
at
long
range
with
the
outer
world
as
some
of
these
men
were
to
go
out
to
the
railway
the
following
sunday
and
offered
to
carry
mail
for
us
we
began
to
write
letters
to
let
our
friends
know
how
we
were
faring
on
our
peculiar
voyage
this
brown
hole
was
the
place
selected
by
a
man
who
pretended
to
have
been
with
the
former
party
for
the
scene
of
that
party
destruction
which
he
reported
to
the
newspapers
he
thought
as
it
was
called
a
hole
it
must
be
one
of
the
worst
places
on
this
raging
river
not
knowing
that
in
the
old
trapper
days
when
a
man
found
a
snug
valley
and
dwelt
there
for
a
time
it
became
known
as
his
hole
in
the
nomenclature
of
the
mountains
the
major
did
not
think
this
a
satisfactory
name
and
he
changed
it
to
brown
park
which
it
now
bears
i
met
an
old
timer
on
a
western
train
several
years
afterward
who
was
greatly
irritated
because
of
this
liberty
which
the
major
took
with
the
cherished
designation
of
the
early
days
fort
davy
crockett
of
the
period
was
located
somewhere
in
this
valley

park
photograph
by
beaman
the
next
morning
after
reaching
harrell
camp
we
were
told
that
as
frank
did
not
seem
able
to
stand
the
voyage
he
was
to
leave
us
here
to
go
over
the
mountains
back
to
the
railway
whence
he
would
go
home
we
were
all
sorry
to
hear
this
and
doubly
sorry
when
on
sunday
the
he
mounted
a
mule
and
regretfully
rode
away
with
harrell
the
latter
was
to
telegraph
to
salt
lake
to
powell
to
send
our
mail
back
to
green
river
station
so
that
it
could
be
brought
out
to
us
on
harrell
return
meanwhile
we
dropped
down
the
river
now
tranquil
as
a
pond
with
low
banks
covered
with
cottonwood
groves
there
were
two
small
canyons
the
first
of
which
we
called
little
about
mile
long
and
the
second
swallow
about
two
miles
long
the
cliffs
were
red
sandstone
about
three
hundred
feet
high
often
vertical
on
both
sides
thousands
of
swallows
swarmed
there
and
we
did
not
resist
giving
it
an
obvious
name
below
this
the
water
spread
out
more
and
was
full
of
islands
the
current
was
sluggish
two
miles
an
hour
perhaps
and
we
indulged
in
the
novelty
of
rowing
the
boats
though
we
did
not
try
to
make
speed
for
we
had
to
wait
for
harrell
return
anyhow
the
boats
had
been
lightened
by
trading
to
harrell
some
of
our
flour
of
which
we
had
an
over
abundance
when
it
came
to
portages
for
fresh
beef
of
which
we
were
very
much
in
need
at
a
convenient
place
we
landed
where
there
was
a
fine
cottonwood
grove
and
remained
while
made
a
climb
and
to
jerk
the
beef
it
was
cut
into
thin
strips
and
hung
on
a
willow
framework
in
the
sun
with
a
slow
fire
beneath
as
the
thermometer
now
stood
at
in
the
shade
the
beef
was
fairly
well
cured
by
the
and
we
went
on
seeing
one
of
the
cattlemen
and
a
mexican
boy
on
the
left
bank
in
this
neighbourhood
we
passed
from
utah
into
colorado
the
river
was
six
hundred
feet
broad
and
about
six
feet
deep
we
had
no
trouble
from
shoals
and
finally
lashed
the
three
boats
side
by
side
and
let
them
drift
along
in
the
slow
current
the
major
sitting
in
his
on
the
middle
boat
read
aloud
selections
from
lady
of
the
which
seemed
to
fit
the
scene
well
steward
and
andy
amused
themselves
by
swimming
along
with
the
boats
and
occasionally
diving
under
them
from
our
noon
camp
in
a
grove
of
cottonwoods
opposite
the
mouth
of
vermilion
river
we
could
plainly
see
the
great
portal
a
mile
or
two
away
the
gate
of
lodore
where
all
this
tranquillity
would
end
for
the
river
cuts
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
mountains
forming
one
of
the
finest
canyons
of
the
series
where
the
water
comes
down
as
southey
described
it
at
lodore
and
the
major
gave
it
that
name
before
night
we
were
at
the
very
entrance
and
made
our
camp
there
in
a
grove
of
every
man
was
looking
forward
to
this
canyon
with
some
dread
and
before
losing
ourselves
within
its
depths
we
expected
to
enjoy
the
letters
from
home
which
harrell
was
to
bring
back
from
the
railway
for
us
myriads
of
mosquitoes
gave
us
something
else
to
think
of
for
they
were
exceedingly
ferocious
and
persistent
driving
us
to
a
high
bluff
where
a
smudge
was
built
to
fight
them
off
we
were
nearly
devoured
i
fared
best
a
friend
having
given
me
a
net
for
my
head
and
this
with
buckskin
gloves
on
my
hands
enabled
me
to
exist
with
some
comfort
the
mountains
rose
abruptly
just
beyond
our
camp
and
the
river
cleaved
the
solid
mass
at
one
stroke
forming
the
extraordinary
and
magnificent
portal
we
named
the
gate
of
lodore
one
of
the
most
striking
entrances

for
miles
climbed
the
left
side
of
the
gate
and
also
took
observations
for
time
i
was
sent
back
to
the
valley
to
make
some
sketches
and
also
to
accompany
steward
on
a
geological
tramp
we
had
an
uncomfortable
experience
because
of
the
excessive
heat
and
aridity
i
learned
several
things
about
mountaineering
that
i
never
forgot
one
of
which
was
to
always
thoroughly
note
and
mark
a
place
where
anything
is
left
to
be
picked
up
on
a
return
for
leaving
our
haversack
under
a
cedar
it
eluded
all
search
till
the
next
day
and
meanwhile
we
were
compelled
to
go
to
the
river
two
or
three
miles
away
for
water
we
had
a
rubber
poncho
and
a
blanket
using
the
rubber
for
a
mattress
and
the
blanket
for
a
covering
we
passed
the
night
starting
early
for
the
mountains
where
at
last
we
found
our
food
bag
after
eating
a
biscuit
we
went
back
to
the
river
and
made
tea
and
toasted
some
beef
on
the
end
of
a
ramrod
when
we
struck
for
the
main
camp
arriving
at
the
gate
of
lodore
seemed
naturally
the
beginning
of
a
new
stage
in
our
voyage
to
which
we
turned

some
anxiety

the

of

harrell
party
who
was
to
travel
overland
from
green
river
station
with
mail
for
us
from
salt
lake
arrived
with
only
two
letters
the
despatch
had
been
too
late
to
stop
the
packet
which
already
had
been
started
for
the
uinta
indian
agency
whence
it
would
reach
us
at
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
river
it
would
be
another
month
at
least
before
we
could
receive
those
longed
for
words
from
home
there
was
nothing
now
to
delay
us
further
and
after
dinner
the
boats
were
prepared
for
canyon
work
again
through
brown
park
we
had
not
been
obliged
to
pay
much
attention
to
arrangements
but
now
the
story
was
to
be
different
the
cabins
were
packed
with
unusual
care
the
were
inflated
and
put
where
they
could
be
quickly
seized
on
the
approach
to
a
bad
descent
and
at
four
we
were
afloat
the
wide
horizon
vanished
the
cliffs
red
and
majestic
rose
at
one
bound
to
a
height
of
about
feet
on
each
side
the
most
abrupt
and
magnificent
gateway
to
a
canyon
imaginable
we
entered
slowly
for
the
current
in
the
beginning
is
not
swift
and
we
watched
the
mighty
precipices
while
they
appeared
to
fold
themselves
together
behind
and
shut
us
more
than
ever
away
from
the
surrounding
wilderness
for
a
short
time
the
stream
was
quite
tame
then
the
murmur
of
distant
troubled
waters
reached
us
and
we
prepared
for
work
the
first
rapid
was
not
a
bad
one
we
ran
it
without
halting
and
ran
three
more
in
quick
succession
one
of
which
was
rather
ugly
illustration
the
head
of
the
canyon
of
lodore
just
inside
the
gate
photograph
by
beaman
this
success
caused
some
of
us
prematurely
to
conclude
that
perhaps
the
way
the
water
comes
down
at
lodore
was
not
so
terrific
as
had
been
anticipated
the
major
said
nothing
he
kept
his
eyes
directed
ahead
the
river
ran
about
feet
wide
with
a
current
of
to
miles
an
hour
in
the
rapids
at
every
bend
new
vistas
of
beauty
were
exhibited
and
the
cliffs
impressed
us
more
and
more
by
their
increasing
height
and
sublimity
landing
places
were
numerous
presently
there
came
to
our
ears
a
roar
with
an
undertone
which
spoke
a
language
now
familiar
and
we
kept
as
close
to
the
right
bank
as
possible
so
that
a
stop
could
be
instantly
made
at
the
proper
moment
when
this
moment
arrived
a
landing
was
effected
for
examination
and
it
revealed
a
furious
descent
studded
with
large
rocks
with
a
possibility
of
safely
running
through
it
if
an
exact
course
could
be
held
but
the
hour
being
now
late
a
camp
was
made
at
the
head
and
further
investigation
deferred
till
the
next
morning
this
morning
was
sunday
and
the
sun
shone
into
the
canyon
with
dazzling
brilliancy
all
being
tranquil
except
the
foaming
rapid
the
locality
was
so
fascinating
that
we
lingered
to
explore
finding
especial
interest
in
a
delightful
grotto
carved
out
of
the
red
sandstone
by
the
waters
of
a
small
brook
the
entrance
was
narrow
barely
feet
a
mere
cleft
in
the
beginning
but
as
one
proceeded
up
it
between
walls
feet
high
the
cleft
widened
till
at
rods
it
ended
in
an
amphitheatre
feet
in
diameter
with
a
domed
top
clear
cold
water
trickled
and
dropped
in
thousands
of
globules
from
everything
mosses
and
ferns
filled
all
the
crevices
adding
a
brilliant
green
to
the
picture
while
far
up
overhead
a
little
ribbon
of
blue
sky
could
be
seen
and
beyond
the
mouth
the
yellow
river
it
was
an
exquisite
scene
at
the
request
of
steward
it
discoverer
it
was
named
after
his
little
daughter
winnie
grotto
so
charming
was
it
here
that
we
did
not
get
off
till
ten
beaman
meanwhile
taking
several
views
it
was
decided
to
run
the
rapid
for
there
was
a
comparatively
straight
channel
about
ten
feet
wide
and
it
was
only
a
question
of
steering
right
as
our
boat
was
to
take
it
first
the
other
crews
came
to
a
point
where
they
could
watch
us
to
advantage
and
profit
by
our
experience
sticks
as
usual
had
been
thrown
in
to
determine
the
trend
of
the
main
current
which
must
always
be
considered
in
dealing
with
any
rapid
if
it
dashes
against
a
cliff
below
means
must
be
found
to
cut
across
before
reaching
that
point
on
the
other
hand
if
the
main
current
has
a
comparatively
clear
chute
running
through
is
not
a
difficult
matter
as
in
the
present
case
we
pulled
a
short
distance
before
putting
out
into
the
middle
then
we
took
the
rapid
as
squarely
as
possible
we
saw
that
we
would
have
to
go
sharply
to
the
left
to
avoid
one
line
of
rocks
and
then
to
the
right
to
clear
another
both
of
which
actions
were
successfully
accomplished
then
we
waited
below
for
the
others
they
had
no
trouble
either
and
the
three
boats
sped
on
and
on
into
the
greater
depths
beyond
where
wilder
waters
were
foaming
all
rapids
have
tails
of
waves
tapering
out
below
that
is
the
waves
grow
smaller
as
they
increase
the
distance
from
the
initial
wave
these
waves
are
the
reverse
of
sea
waves
the
form
remaining
in
practically
one
place
while
the
water
flies
through
in
many
rapids
there
is
an
eddy
on
each
side
of
this
tail
in
which
a
current
runs
with
great
force
if
a
boat
is
caught
in
this
eddy
it
may
be
carried
a
second
time
through
a
part
of
the
rapid
we
soon
arrived
at
another
rapid
in
which
this
very
thing
happened
to
our
boat
we
were
caught
by
the
eddy
and
carried
to
be
launched
directly
into
the
path
of
the
which
had
started
down
skilfully
threw
his
boat
to
one
side
and
succeeded
in
avoiding
a
collision
nothing
could
be
done
with
our
boat
but
to
let
her
go
where
she
would
for
the
moment
we
then
ran
two
other
rapids
rough
ones
too
but
there
was
no
trouble
in
them
for
any
of
the
boats
the
velocity
at
this
stage
of
water
was
astonishing
and
the
opportunities
to
land
in
quiet
water
between
the
rapids
now
were
few

photograph
by
hillers
about
as
we
emerged
at
high
speed
from
one
rapid
we
saw
immediately
below
lying
in
ominous
shadow
another
it
had
a
forbidding
look
in
red
canyon
owing
to
the
trend
the
sun
fell
to
the
bottom
for
many
more
hours
than
in
lodore
which
has
a
trend
hence
here
even
at
high
noon
one
side
or
the
other
might
be
in
deep
shadow
in
this
particular
case
it
was
the
left
wall
which
came
down
very
straight
to
the
river
the
outside
of
a
bend
opposite
was
a
rocky
wooded
point
between
these
the
rapid
swept
down
there
was
no
slack
water
separating
the
end
of
the
rapid
we
left
from
the
beginning
of
this
one
so
obscurely
situated
landing
was
no
easy
task
at
the
speed
with
which
we
were
flying
but
it
would
not
do
to
try
to
run
the
rapid
without
an
examination
the
only
possible
place
to
stop
was
on
the
right
where
there
was
a
cove
with
a
little
strip
of
beach
and
we
headed
for
it
instantly
pulling
with
every
muscle
yet
we
continued
going
on
down
at
railway
speed
when
at
last
we
arrived
within
a
few
feet
of
the
bank
the
problem
was
how
to
stop
the
water
appeared
shallow
though
we
could
not
see
bottom
on
account
of
its
murky
character
and
there
was
only
one
course
which
was
to
jump
out
and
make
anchors
of
our
legs
as
we
did
so
we
sank
to
our
waists
and
were
pulled
along
for
a
moment
but
our
feet
braced
against
the
large
rocks
on
the
bottom
served
the
purpose
and
the
momentum
was
overcome
once
the
velocity
was
gone
it
was
easy
to
get
the
boat
to
the
beach
and
she
was
tied
there
just
in
time
to
allow
us
to
rush
to
the
help
of
the
scarcely
had
the
been
tied
up
than
the
came
darting
for
the
same
spot
like
a
locomotive
with
the
force
on
hand
she
was
easily
controlled
and
the
fact
that
she
carried
the
cook
outfit
as
well
as
the
cook
added
to
our
joy
at
having
her
so
speedily
on
the
beach
andy
went
to
work
immediately
to
build
a
fire
and
prepare
dinner
while
the
rest
overhauled
the
boats
took
observations
plotted
notes
or
did
other
necessary
things
and
the
major
and
went
down
to
take
a
close
look
at
the
rapid
which
had
caused
us
such
sudden
and
violent
exertion
they
reported
a
clear
channel
in
the
middle
and
when
we
continued
after
dinner
we
went
through
easily
and
safely
as
of
course
we
could
have
done
in
the
first
place
if
the
major
had
been
willing
to
take
an
unknown
risk
but
in
the
shadow
the
fall
might
have
been
almost
anything
and
it
would
have
been
foolhardy
to
run
it
without
examination
even
though
we
found
it
so
hard
to
stop
below
the
rapid
that
had
halted
us
so
abruptly
there
was
nothing
for
about
a
mile
but
easy
running
when
we
stopped
in
a
cove
to
examine
another
rapid
here
started
up
eleven
mountain
sheep
but
by
the
time
he
had
come
back
to
the
boats
for
a
gun
they
were
beyond
reach
though
this
rapid
could
be
easily
run
there
was
just
below
it
only
a
short
distance
the
fall
where
the
was
wrecked
on
the
first
trip
and
we
would
have
to
be
cautious
for
the
approach
to
that
fall
we
knew
was
treacherous
the
river
comes
at
this
point
from
the
east
bends
south
then
west
and
it
is
just
at
the
western
bend
that
the
steep
rush
of
the
big
fall
begins
and
continues
for
of
a
mile
on
the
right
the
waters
beat
fiercely
against
the
foot
of
the
perpendicular
wall
while
on
the
left
they
are
confined
by
a
rocky
point
the
end
of
which
is
composed
of
enormous
blocks
the
space
for
the
stream
between
this
point
and
the
opposite
cliff
is
narrow
while
the
river
above
it
spreads
rather
wide
with
a
deep
bay
on
the
left
where
there
is
quiet
water
this
bay
is
protected
a
quarter
of
a
mile
up
by
a
jutting
point
and
is
merely
back
water
just
off
the
point
the
whole
river
suddenly
becomes
and
quite
smooth
with
all
the
currents
drawing
strongly
in
from
every
direction
and
pouring
toward
and
over
the
falls
an
object
once
within
the
grip
of
this
sag
as
we
called
it
is
obliged
to
pass
over
the
falls
the
situation
is
peculiar
and
it
occurs
nowhere
else
on
the
whole
river
not
being
understood
on
the
first
voyage
one
of
the
boats
the
was
trapped
driven
over
the
falls
and
broken
to
fragments
though
the
men
were
rescued
below
the
disaster
was
the
cause
of
some
unpleasantness
on
that
voyage
the
men
blaming
the
major
for
not
signalling
properly
and
he
blaming
them
for
not
landing
quickly
when
he
signalled
we
were
on
the
lookout
for
it
and
the
major
having
the
wreck
to
emphasise
the
peculiarities
of
the
sag
desired
to
have
every
boat
turn
the
point
at
the
correct
moment
ours
ran
through
the
preliminary
rapid
easily
and
we
dropped
cautiously
down
upon
our
great
enemy
hugging
the
left
bank
as
closely
as
we
could
to
reach
the
jutting
point
around
which
the
boat
must
pass
to
arrive
in
the
safe
waters
of
the
bay
we
turned
the
point
with
no
difficulty
and
proceeded
a
distance
across
the
bay
where
we
landed
on
a
beach
to
watch
for
the
other
boats
the
steersmen
having
been
informed
as
to
the
precariousness
of
the
locality
nevertheless
it
was
so
deceptive
that
when
the
came
in
sight
she
was
not
close
enough
to
the
left
shore
for
safety
the
major
signalled
vigorously
with
his
hat
and
took
the
warning
instantly
and
turned
in
but
when
the
appeared
we
saw
at
once
that
she
was
altogether
too
far
out
and
for
some
seconds
we
stood
almost
petrified
while
the
major
again
signalled
with
all
his
might
it
seemed
an
even
chance
then
she
gained
on
the
current
and
finally
reached
good
water
whence
she
came
to
our
position
beaman
had
been
a
pilot
on
the
great
lakes
and
was
expert
with
a
and
probably
for
that
reason
he
was
somewhat
careless
there
was
hardly
an
excuse
in
this
instance
for
a
boat
not
to
take
the
proper
course
for
the
experience
of
the
told
the
whole
story
yet
the
place
is
so
peculiar
and
unusual
that
one
even
forewarned
may
fail
across
the
bay
pulling
was
safe
and
we
ran
to
a
beach
very
close
to
the
head
of
the
falls
where
we
made
our
camp
the
sun
now
being
low
and
the
huge
cliffs
casting
a
profound
and
sombre
shadow
into
the
bottom
it
was
a
wild
a
fierce
an
impressive
situation
the
unending
heavy
roar
of
the
tumbling
river
the
difficulty
if
not
impossibility
of
turning
back
even
if
such
a
thing
had
been
desired
the
equal
difficulty
if
not
impossibility
of
scaling
the
walls
that
stood
more
than
feet
above
us
and
the
general
sublimity
of
the
entire
surroundings
rendered
our
position
to
my
mind
intensely
dramatic
two
years
before
on
this
identical
spot
the
major
had
camped
with
the
loss
of
one
of
his
boats
bearing
heavily
on
his
mind
though
his
magnificent
will
his
cheerful
and
his
unconquerable
determination
to
dominate
any
situation
gave
him
power
and
allied
him
to
the
river
itself
the
place
practically
chose
its
own
name
disaster
falls
and
it
was
so
recorded
by
the
topographers
a
hard
portage
was
ahead
of
us
and
all
turned
in
early
to
prepare
by
a
good
sleep
for
the
long
work
of
the
next
day
no
tent
as
a
rule
was
erected
unless
there
was
rain
and
then
a
large
canvas
from
each
boat
was
put
up
on
oars
or
other
sticks
the
ends
being
left
open
in
a
driving
storm
a
blanket
would
answer
to
fill
in
as
there
was
now
no
indication
of
a
storm
our
beds
were
placed
on
the
sand
as
usual
with
the
sides
of
the
canyon
for
chamber
walls
and
the
multitudinous
stars
for
roof
a
short
distance
below
the
great
rapid
near
which
we
were
camped
was
a
second
equally
bad
the
two
together
making
up
the
mile
descent
of
disaster
falls
between
them
the
river
became
level
for
a
brief
space
and
wider
and
a
deposit
of
boulders
and
gravel
appeared
there
in
the
middle
above
the
surface
at
the
present
stage
of
water
it
was
this
island
which
had
saved
the
occupants
of
the
and
from
which
they
were
rescued
we
were
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
began
to
carry
the
cargoes
by
a
trail
we
made
over
and
around
the
huge
boulders
to
a
place
below
the
bad
water
of
the
first
fall
the
temperature
was
in
the
and
it
was
hot
work
climbing
with
a
sack
on
one
back
but
at
last
after
many
trips
back
and
forth
every
article
was
below
then
the
empty
boats
were
taken
one
at
a
time
and
by
pulling
lifting
and
sliding
on
skids
of
driftwood
and
by
floating
wherever
practicable
in
the
quieter
edges
of
the
water
we
got
them
successfully
past
the
first
fall
here
the
loads
were
replaced
and
with
our
good
long
and
strong
lines
an
inch
thick
the
boats
were
sent
down
several
hundred
yards
in
the
rather
level
water
referred
to
intervening
between
the
foot
of
the
upper
fall
and
the
head
of
the
lower
to
the
beginning
of
the
second
descent
this
all
occupied
much
time
for
nothing
could
be
done
rapidly
and
noon
came
in
the
midst
of
our
work
anticipating
this
event
andy
had
gone
ahead
with
his
cook
outfit
and
had
baked
the
dinner
bread
in
his
dutch
oven
with
the
usual
fried
bacon
and
coffee
the
inner
man
was
speedily
fortified
for
another
wrestle
with
the
difficult
and
laborious
situation
the
dinner
bread
was
baked
from
flour
taken
out
of
a
sack
that
was
found
lying
on
top
of
an
immense
boulder
far
above
the
river
this
was
flour
that
had
been
rescued
by
the
former
party
from
the
wreckage
of
the
but
as
they
could
not
add
it
to
their
remaining
heavily
laden
boats
the
major
had
been
compelled
to
leave
it
lying
here
they
needed
it
badly
enough
towards
the
end
it
was
still
sweet
and
good
but
we
could
not
take
it
either
we
were
so
much
better
provisioned
than
the
former
party
that
it
was
besides
not
necessary
for
us
and
we
also
left
it
where
it
was
our
supplies
were
not
likely
to
fail
us
at
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
and
beyond
that
there
was
not
yet
need
to
worry
although
there
were
only
two
points
below
gunnison
crossing
in
a
distance
of
nearly
miles
where
it
was
known
that
the
river
could
be
reached
the
crossing
of
the
fathers
and
the
mouth
of
the
paria
not
far
below
it
we
felt
sure
that
those
who
had
been
charged
with
the
bringing
of
supplies
to
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
would
be
able
to
get
there
and
as
we
were
to
stop
for
the
season
at
the
paria
we
would
have
time
to
plan
for
beyond
in
any
case
our
boats
were
carrying
now
all
they
could
and
without
a
regret
we
turned
our
backs
on
the
outcast
flour
it
was
an
ordinary
sack
of
bolted
wheat
flour
first
in
a
cotton
bag
then
in
a
gunny
bag
and
had
been
lying
unbroken
for
two
years
the
outside
for
half
an
inch
was
hard
but
inside
of
that
the
flour
was
in
excellent
condition
two
oars
were
also
found
they
were
doubtless
from
the
illustration
dellenbaugh
the
heart
of
lodore
photograph
by
beaman
after
dinner
we
once
more
unloaded
the
boats
and
carried
everything
on
our
backs
up
and
across
a
long
rocky
hill
or
point
down
to
a
spot
about
a
third
of
a
mile
altogether
where
the
goods
were
piled
on
a
smooth
little
beach
at
the
margin
of
a
quiet
bay
it
took
many
trips
and
it
was
exhausting
work
but
in
addition
to
bringing
the
cargoes
down
we
also
by
half
past
five
got
one
of
the
boats
there
by
working
it
over
the
rocks
and
along
the
edge
here
we
camped
and
had
supper
as
soon
as
andy
could
get
it
ready
it
may
be
asked
by
some
not
familiar
with
scientific
work
how
we
always
knew
the
time
but
as
we
had
the
necessary
instruments
for
taking
time
astronomically
there
was
nothing
difficult
about
it
we
also
carried
fine
chronometers
and
had
a
number
of
watches
in
the
sand
near
the
camp
which
place
at
highest
water
might
have
formed
an
eddy
behind
some
huge
rocks
a
few
old
knives
forks
a
rusty
bake
oven
and
other
articles
were
found
the
wreckage
from
some
party
prior
to
that
of
the
major
first
he
said
they
had
not
left
anything
of
that
sort
and
he
had
noticed
the
same
things
on
the
former
trip
the
total
fall
of
the
river
here
is
about
fifty
feet
and
no
boat
could
get
through
without
smashing
the
morning
of
june
found
us
early
at
work
bringing
down
the
two
boats
we
had
left
and
as
soon
as
this
was
accomplished
the
cargoes
were
put
on
once
more
and
we
lowered
the
three
one
at
a
time
along
the
left
bank
by
means
of
our
hawsers
with
everything
in
them
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
another
bad
place
which
we
called
lower
disaster
falls
here
we
unloaded
and
made
a
short
portage
while
andy
was
getting
dinner
when
we
had
disposed
of
this
and
reloaded
we
pulled
into
the
river
which
averaged
about
feet
wide
with
a
current
in
places
of
miles
or
more
and
quickly
arrived
at
three
bad
rapids
in
succession
all
of
which
we
ran
triumphantly
though
the
former
party
made
portages
around
them
in
the
third
our
boat
took
in
so
much
water
that
we
made
a
landing
in
order
to
bail
out
continuing
immediately
we
reached
another
heavy
rapid
but
ran
it
without
even
stopping
to
reconnoitre
as
the
way
seemed
perfectly
clear
we
took
the
next
rapid
with
equal
success
though
our
boat
got
caught
in
an
eddy
and
was
turned
completely
round
while
the
others
ran
past
us
they
landed
to
wait
and
there
we
all
took
a
little
breathing
spell
before
attempting
to
run
another
rapid
just
below
which
we
made
camp
in
a
grove
of
cedars
at
the
beginning
of
a
descent
that
looked
so
ugly
it
was
decided
to
make
a
on
the
following
day
everybody
was
wet
to
the
skin
and
glad
to
get
on
some
dry
clothes
as
soon
as
we
could
pull
out
our
bags
the
cliffs
had
now
reached
an
altitude
of
at
least
feet
and
they
appeared
to
be
nearly
perpendicular
but
generally
not
from
the
edge
where
there
was
usually
a
bank
of
some
kind
or
the
foot
of
a
steep
talus
there
were
and
cottonwood
trees
here
and
there
and
cedars
up
the
cliffs
wherever
they
could
find
a
footing
on
the
heights
tall
pine
trees
could
be
seen
the
cliff
just
opposite
camp
was
almost
vertical
from
the
rapid
at
its
foot
to
the
brink
feet
above
and
flame
red
after
supper
as
we
all
sat
in
admiration
and
peering
with
some
awe
at
the
narrow
belt
of
sky
narrower
than
we
had
before
seen
it
the
stars
slowly
came
out
and
presently
on
the
exact
edge
of
the
magnificent
precipice
set
there
like
a
diadem
appeared
the
constellation
of
the
harp
it
was
an
impressive
sight
and
immediately
the
name
was
bestowed
the
cliff
of
the
harp
read
aloud
and
jack
gave
us
a
song
or
two
before
we
went
to
sleep
feeling
well
satisfied
with
our
progress
into
the
heart
of
lodore
this
portion
of
the
river
has
a
very
great
declivity
the
greatest
as
we
afterwards
determined
on
the
entire
green
and
colorado
with
the
exception
of
a
section
of
cataract
and
a
part
of
the
first
granite
gorge
of
the
grand
canyon
where
the
declivity
is
much
the
same
with
cataract
canyon
in
the
lead
a
above
our
camp
a
fine
little
stream
cascade
creek
came
in
on
the
right
beaman
made
some
photographs
in
the
morning
and
we
began
to
work
the
boats
down
along
the
edge
of
the
rapid
beside
which
we
had
camped
this
took
us
till
noon
and
we
had
dinner
before
venturing
on
when
we
set
forth
we
had
good
luck
and
soon
put
four
rapids
behind
running
the
first
letting
down
past
two
and
running
the
fourth
which
was
a
pretty
bad
one
of
a
mile
of
smooth
water
then
gave
us
a
respite
much
appreciated
when
we
arrived
at
a
wild
descent
about
as
bad
as
disaster
falls
though
more
safely
approached
this
was
called
triplet
falls
by
the
first
party
we
went
into
camp
at
the
head
of
it
on
the
left
bank
this
day
we
found
a
number
of
fragments
of
the
here
and
there
besides
an
axe
and
a
vise
abandoned
by
the
first
party
and
a
welcome
addition
to
our
library
in
a
copy
of
this
was
the
first
magazine
ever
to
penetrate
to
these
extreme
wilds
the
river
was
from
to
feet
wide
and
the
walls
ran
along
with
little
change
about
feet
high
opposite
camp
was
dunn
cliff
the
end
of
the
sierra
escalante
about
feet
high
named
for
one
of
the
first
party
who
was
killed
by
the
indians
down
in
arizona
we
remained
a
day
here
to
let
the
topographers
climb
out
if
they
could
they
had
little
trouble
in
doing
this
and
after
a
pleasant
climb
reached
the
top
through
a
gulch
at
an
altitude
above
the
river
of
feet
the
view
was
extensive
and
their
efforts
were
rewarded
by
obtaining
much
topographical
information
late
in
the
day
the
sky
grew
dark
the
thunder
rolled
and
just
before
supper
we
had
a
good
shower

on
the
progress
was
continued
and
every
one
felt
well
after
the
cessation
for
a
day
of
the
knocking
about
amidst
the
foam
and
boulders
it
took
us
with
hard
work
till
two
to
get
past
triplet
falls
by
means
of
a
double
portage
about
half
a
mile
below
this
we
were
confronted
by
one
of
the
worst
looking
places
we
had
yet
seen
and
at
the
suggestion
of
steward
it
received
the
significant
name
of
half
mile
the
entire
river
for
more
than
half
a
mile
was
one
sheet
of
white
foam
there
was
not
a
quiet
spot
in
the
whole
distance
and
the
water
plunged
and
pounded
in
its
fierce
descent
and
sent
up
a
deafening
roar
the
only
way
one
could
be
heard
was
to
yell
with
full
lung
power
landing
at
the
head
of
it
easily
we
there
unloaded
the
and
let
her
down
by
line
for
some
distance
in
the
worst
place
she
capsized
but
was
not
damaged
then
the
water
near
the
shore
we
were
on
though
turbulent
in
the
extreme
became
so
shallow
on
account
of
the
great
width
of
the
rapid
here
that
when
we
had
again
loaded
the
there
were
places
where
we
were
forced
to
walk
alongside
and
lift
her
over
rocks
but
several
men
at
the
same
time
always
had
a
strong
hold
on
the
shore
end
of
the
line
in
this
way
we
got
her
down
as
far
as
was
practicable
by
that
method
at
this
point
the
river
changed
the
water
became
more
concentrated
and
consequently
deeper
it
was
necessary
to
unload
the
boat
again
and
work
her
on
down
with
a
couple
of
men
in
her
and
the
rest
holding
the
line
on
shore
as
we
had
done
above
when
the
roughest
part
was
past
in
this
manner
we
made
her
fast
and
proceeded
to
carry
her
cargo
down
to
this
spot
which
took
some
time
it
was
there
put
on
board
again
and
the
hatches
firmly
secured
the
boat
was
held
firmly
behind
a
huge
sheltering
rock
and
when
all
was
ready
her
crew
took
their
places
with
the
major
clinging
to
the
middle
cabin
as
his
chair
had
been
left
above
and
would
be
carried
down
later
we
shoved
out
into
the
swift
current
here
free
from
rocks
and
literally
bounded
over
the
waves
that
formed
the
end
of
the
descent
to
clear
water
where
we
landed
on
a
snug
little
beach
and
made
the
boat
secure
for
the
night
picking
our
way
along
shore
back
to
the
head
of
the
rapid
camp
was
made
there
as
the
darkness
was
falling
and
nothing
more
could
be
done
that
night

it
was
next
to
impossible
to
converse
but
every
one
being
very
tired
it
was
not
long
after
supper
before
we
took
to
the
blankets
and
not
a
man
was
kept
awake
by
the
noise
it
seemed
only
a
few
moments
before
it
was
time
to
go
at
it
again
all
hands
were
up
early
and
the
other
two
boats
were
taken
laboriously
down
in
the
same
manner
as
the
had
been
engineered
but
though
we
toiled
steadily
it
was
one
by
the
time
we
succeeded
in
placing
them
alongside
that
boat
anticipating
this
andy
utensils
were
taken
down
on
the
and
while
we
were
working
with
the
our
good
chef
prepared
the
dinner
and
we
stopped
long
enough
to
fortify
ourselves
with
it
having
to
build
a
trail
in
some
places
in
order
to
carry
the
goods
across
ridges
and
boulders
it
was
not
alone
the
work
on
lowering
the
boats
which
delayed
us
while
we
were
absorbed
in
these
operations
the
of
the
morning
in
some
way
spread
unperceived
into
the
thick
and
cedars
which
covered
the
point
and
we
vacated
the
place
none
too
soon
for
the
flames
were
leaping
high
and
by
the
time
we
had
finished
our
dinner
at
the
foot
of
the
rapid
the
point
we
had
so
recently
left
was
a
horrible
furnace
the
fire
was
jumping
and
playing
amidst
dense
smoke
which
rolled
a
mighty
column
a
thousand
feet
it
seemed
to
me
above
the
top
of
the
canyon
that
is
over
feet
into
the
tranquil
air
at
two
all
three
boats
were
again
charging
down
on
a
stiff
current
with
rather
bad
conditions
though
we
ran
two
sharp
rapids
without
much
trouble
in
one
the
got
on
a
smooth
rock
and
came
near
capsizing
the
current
at
the
spot
happened
to
be
not
so
swift
and
she
escaped
with
no
damage
then
we
were
brought
up
by
another
rapid
a
very
bad
one
evening
was
drawing
on
and
every
man
was
feeling
somewhat
used
up
by
the
severe
exertions
of
the
day
camp
was
therefore
ordered
at
the
head
of
this
rapid
in
the
midst
of
scenery
that
has
probably
as
great
beauty
picturesqueness
and
grandeur
as
any
to
be
found
in
the
whole
west
i
hardly
know
how
to
describe
it
all
day
long
the
surroundings
had
been
supremely
beautiful
majestic
but
at
this
camp
everything
was
on
a
superlative
scale
and
words
seem
colourless
and
futile
the
precipices
on
both
sides
about
feet
high
conveyed
the
impression
of
being
almost
vertical
our
camp
was
several
hundred
yards
from
the
rapid
and
we
could
talk
with
some
comfort
after
supper
i
wandered
alone
down
beside
the
furiously
plunging
waters
and
came
upon
a
brood
of
young
magpies
airing
themselves
on
the
sand
the
roar
of
the
fall
prevented
their
hearing
and
i
walked
among
them
picked
one
up
and
took
it
to
camp
to
show
their
comicality
when
i
let
it
go
back
to
the
rendezvous
i
was
censured
especially
by
the
major
for
cruelty
to
animals
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
it
came
with
a
radiance
that
further
enhanced
the
remarkable
grandeur
around
us
near
by
was
a
side
canyon
of
the
most
picturesque
type
down
which
a
clear
little
brook
danced
from
ledge
to
ledge
and
from
pool
to
pool
twenty
to
thirty
feet
at
a
time
we
named
it
leaping
brook
the
rocks
were
mossy
and
fir
trees
pines
cedars
and
cottonwoods
added
the
charm
of
foliage
to
the
brilliant
colours
of
the
rocks
and
the
sheen
of
falling
water
here
and
there
lost
in
the
most
profound
shadows
beaman
made
a
number
of
views
while
the
rest
of
the
men
climbed
for
various
purposes
steward
clem
and
i
by
a
circuitous
route
arrived
at
a
point
high
up
on
leaping
brook
where
the
scene
was
beyond
description
to
save
trouble
on
the
return
we
descended
the
brook
as
it
was
easy
to
slide
down
places
that
could
not
be
climbed
in
this
manner
we
succeeded
in
getting
to
the
last
descent
near
camp
to
discover
that
it
was
higher
than
we
thought
and
almost
vertical
with
rough
rocks
at
the
bottom
as
we
could
not
go
back
and
had
no
desire
to
break
a
leg
we
were
in
trouble
then
we
spied
jack
in
the
camp
a
short
distance
away
and
called
to
him
to
put
a
tree
up
for
us
jack
always
ready
to
help
assumed
a
gruff
tone
and
pretended
he
would
never
help
us
but
we
knew
better
and
presently
he
threw
up
a
long
dead
pine
which
we
could
reach
by
a
short
slide
and
thus
got
to
the
river
level
it
was
now
noon
and
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
the
boats
were
lowered
by
lines
past
the
rapid
beside
camp
and
once
below
this
we
shot
on
our
way
with
a
fine
current
soon
arriving
at
two
moderate
rapids
close
together
which
we
ran
this
brought
us
to
a
third
with
an
ugly
look
but
on
examination
and
the
major
decided
to
run
it
getting
a
good
entrance
all
the
boats
went
through
without
the
slightest
mishap
a
mile
below
this
place
we
landed
at
the
mouth
of
a
pretty
little
stream
entering
through
a
picturesque
and
narrow
canyon
on
the
left
we
called
it
alcove
brook
beaman
took
some
negatives
here
this
was
not
the
easy
matter
that
the
afterwards
made
it
for
the
dark
tent
had
to
be
set
up
the
glass
plate
flowed
with
collodion
then
placed
in
the
silver
bath
and
exposed
wet
in
the
camera
to
be
immediately
developed
and
washed
and
placed
in
a
special
box
for
carriage
this
would
have
been
an
ideal
place
for
a
hunter
numerous
fresh
tracks
of
grizzlies
were
noticed
all
around
but
we
did
not
have
the
good
luck
to
see
any
of
the
animals
themselves
happy
grounds
these
canyons
were
at
that
time
for
the
bears
and
they
may
still
be
enjoying
the
seclusion
the
depths
afford
the
spot
had
an
additional
interest
for
us
because
it
was
here
that
on
the
first
trip
the
brush
caught
fire
soon
after
the
party
had
landed
and
they
were
forced
to
take
to
the
boats
so
unceremoniously
that
they
lost
part
of
their
and
some
clothing
on
leaving
alcove
brook
we
ran
a
rapid
and
then
another
a
little
farther
on
but
they
were
easy
and
the
river
was
much
calmer
though
the
current
was
still
very
swift
at
the
same
time
the
walls
to
our
satisfaction
began
to
give
indications
of
breaking
they
became
less
high
less
compact
and
we
ventured
to
hope
that
our
battle
with
the
waters
of
lodore
was
about
over
the
major
said
that
as
nearly
as
he
could
remember
the
end
of
the
great
gorge
was
not
very
far
below
though
the
sky
was
beginning
to
show
the
evening
tints
we
kept
on
and
ever
on
swiftly
but
smoothly
looking
up
at
the
sky
and
at
the
splendid
walls
the
sun
went
down
the
chasm
grew
hazy
with
the
soft
light
of
evening
and
the
mystery
of
the
bends
deepened
there
was
no
obstruction
and
in
about
three
miles
from
alcove
brook
we
rather
abruptly
emerged
into
a
beautiful
small
opening
where
the
immediate
walls
were
no
more
than
six
hundred
feet
high
a
river
of
considerable
size
flowed
in
on
the
left
through
a
deep
and
narrow
canyon
this
was
the
yampa
sometimes
then
called
bear
river
by
seven
we
had
moored
the
boats
a
few
yards
up
its
mouth
and
we
made
a
comfortable
camp
in
a
grove
we
had
won
the
fight
without
disaster
and
we
slept
that
night
in
peace
lodore
is
wholly
within
the
state
of
colorado
it
is
miles
long
with
a
descent
of
feet
mostly
concentrated
between
disaster
falls
and
hell
a
distance
of
about
miles
the

first
because
after
the
close
quarters
of
lodore
it
seemed
very
and
second
because
from
the
smooth
bare
cliff
directly
opposite
our
landing
a
distinct
echo
of
ten
words
was
returned
to
the
speaker
i
had
never
before
and
have
never
since
heard
so
clear
and
perfect
an
echo
with
so
many
words
repeated
we
were
camped
on
the
right
bank
of
the
yampa
as
the
left
was
a
bottom
land
covered
with
cedars
and
we
preferred
higher
ground
this
bottom
was
an
alluvial
deposit
triangular
in
shape
about
a
mile
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
with
the
yampa
and
green
on
two
sides
and
a
vertical
sandstone
wall
on
the
third
behind
our
camp
the
rocks
broke
back
in
a
rough
steep
slope
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
this
with
the
and
the
lack
of
height
in
the
walls
near
the
river
conveyed
an
impression
of
wide
expanse
when
compared
with
the
narrow
limits
in
which
we
had
for
eight
days
been
confined
the
green
was
here
about
feet
wide
and
was
held
in
on
the
western
side
of
the
park
by
the
echo
cliff
which
was
a
vertical
wall
some
feet
high
composed
of
homogeneous
sandstone
and
consequently
almost
without
a
crack
from
top
to
bottom
where
its
smooth
expanse
dropped
below
the
surface
of
the
water
it
extended
down
river
about
of
a
mile
the
river
doubling
around
its
southern
end
the
next
day
after
arriving
here
most
of
us
did
not
feel
like
doing
any
climbing
and
remained
around
camp
mending
clothes
and
other
articles
adjusting
things
that
had
become
deranged
by
our
rough
work
in
the
last
canyon
recording
notes
and
making
entries
in
diaries
took
observations
for
latitude
and
longitude
to
establish
the
position
of
the
yampa
so
that
it
could
be
properly
placed
on
the
map
the
major
during
an
exploring
trip
from
the
eastward
in
had
reached
the
yampa
canyon
but
he
could
not
cross
it
he
now
decided
to
go
up
with
a
boat
as
far
as
possible
in
three
days
to
supplement
his
former
observations
as
well
as
to
study
the
canyon
in
general
he
had
estimated
its
length
at
thirty
miles
and
this
has
proved
to
be
correct
the
was
unloaded
and
with
three
days
rations
the
major
started
with
her
in
the
morning
manned
by
jack
beaman
jones
and
andy
of
course
they
were
all
still
tired
from
the
strain
of
lodore
and
they
were
not
enthusiastic
about
seeing
the
yampa
in
such
work
as
was
common
through
lodore
it
is
as
much
the
tension
on
the
nerves
even
though
this
is
not
realised
at
the
time
as
it
is
the
strain
on
the
muscles
in
transporting
the
cargoes
and
the
boats
which
makes
one
tired
i
was
entirely
satisfied
not
to
go
with
the
yampa
party
and
i
believe
all
the
others
left
behind
felt
much
the
same
steward
with
clem
when
the
yampa
expedition
had
gone
started
back
over
the
cliffs
for
alcove
brook
to
geologise
leaving
busy
with
observation
cap
plotting
the
topographical
notes
and
making
his
map
thereby
and
me
with
no
special
duty
at
the
time
every
man
who
wants
to
be
efficient
in
the
field
must
learn
to
cook
this
was
my
opportunity
as
andy
was
absent
and
the
others
had
their
special
work
on
hand
so
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
culinary
realm
a
few
directions
and
an
example
from
cap
who
was
a
veteran
gave
me
the
method
and
i
succeeded
as
my
first
offering
in
placing
before
my
comrades
some
biscuits
hot
from
the
dutch
oven
which
compared
favourably
with
those
of
andy
himself
with
the
constant
practice
andy
by
this
time
had
become
an
expert
the
day
wore
away
and
at
evening
i
got
supper
with
more
biscuits
of
which
i
was
proud
but
steward
and
clem
failed
to
come
to
partake
of
them
as
we
expected
darkness
fell
and
still
there
was
dead
silence
outside
of
our
camp
much
concerned
we
then
ate
supper
momentarily
expecting
to
hear
their
voices
but
they
did
not
come
something
had
happened
but
we
could
not
follow
their
trail
till
morning
to
find
out
what
it
was
at
ten
we
gave
them
up
for
the
night
deeply
troubled
about
them
i
had
been
sitting
alone
by
the
fire
keeping
the
coffee
hot
and
listening
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
crackling
of
the
bushes
between
me
and
the
river
and
in
a
second
or
two
clem
laughing
as
over
a
joke
came
to
the
fire
with
the
water
running
off
him
in
streams
while
i
was
trying
to
get
an
explanation
steward
also
appeared
in
the
same
condition
at
first
they
would
not
tell
what
had
occurred
but
finally
they
confessed
on
condition
that
i
would
keep
the
matter
a
secret
they
had
made
a
long
hard
climb
and
late
in
the
afternoon
had
come
to
a
place
where
steward
found
it
necessary
to
descend
to
the
river
in
examining
the
strata
they
intended
to
climb
back
but
when
the
work
was
done
the
sun
had
set
and
it
was
too
late
to
venture
up
as
they
could
not
climb
in
the
dark
rather
than
stay
there
all
night
they
made
a
raft
of
two
little
dead
cedars
and
tying
their
shoes
upon
it
they
waited
for
the
moon
to
rise
this
was
very
soon
and
they
slipped
into
the
current
relying
on
the
raft
merely
to
keep
their
heads
above
water
they
knew
there
were
no
rapids
between
them
and
camp
but
they
did
not
properly
estimate
the
velocity
of
the
river
and
the
eddies
and
whirlpools
they
kept
near
the
left
wall
so
as
not
to
be
carried
past
camp
and
in
this
they
made
a
great
mistake
for
they
were
caught
in
a
whirlpool
caused
by
a
projection
and
the
raft
was
wrenched
from
them
while
they
were
violently
thrown
around
steward
being
a
powerful
swimmer
succeeded
after
nearly
going
under
for
good
in
regaining
the
raft
which
clem
meanwhile
had
been
losing
and
recovering
quickly
several
times
he
was
not
a
good
swimmer
after
this
whirlpool
was
passed
they
reached
the
locality
of
our
camp
with
no
further
adventure
they
were
very
desirous
that
the
story
be
kept
from
the
rest
of
the
party
but
they
had
hardly
finished
telling
me
when
came
and
insisted
on
knowing
what
had
occurred
their
punishment
for
this
indiscretion
was
the
hard
climb
back
again
to
where
they
had
left
a
rifle
and
other
things
that
must
be
recovered
a
delightful
episode
of
this
camp
was
a
row
which
several
of
us
made
up
the
yampa
in
the
moonlight
as
far
as
we
went
the
current
was
not
swift
and
we
were
able
to
pull
gently
along
under
the
great
cliffs
in
shadows
made
luminous
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
moon
a
song
the
major
was
fond
of
singing
and
sweetly
it
comes
from
almost
involuntarily
sprang
from
us
all
though
our
great
songster
jack
was
not
with
us
jack
had
an
extensive
repertory
an
excellent
voice
and
a
hearty
exuberant
spirit
he
would
sing
me
a
letter
from
colleen
lone
starry
isle
of
the
and
many
others
in
a
way
that
brought
tranquillity
to
our
souls
we
missed
him
on
this
evening
but
nevertheless
our
song
sounded
well
echoing
from
wall
to
wall
and
we
liked
it
somehow
or
other
that
night
remains
one
of
the
fairest
pictures
i
have
ever
seen
another
day
i
went
with
steward
down
across
the
triangular
bottom
to
the
lower
end
of
the
park
where
we
climbed
out
through
the
canyon
of
a
little
brook
to
a
sandy
and
desolate
plateau
currant
bushes
laden
with
fruit
abounded
and
there
were
tracks
of
grizzlies
to
be
seen
possibly
some
may
have
been
lying
in
the
dense
underbrush
but
if
so
they
kept
their
lairs
as
these
bears
generally
do
unless
directly
disturbed
on
the
of
june
steward
and
cap
went
for
a
climb
they
proceeded
to
the
lower
end
of
the
park
by
boat
and
through
the
little
canyon
that
came
in
there
got
out
to
the
plateau
where
steward
and
i
had
before
been
but
there
they
went
farther
after
a
very
hard
climb
they
succeeded
in
reaching
the
crest
where
they
had
a
broad
view
and
could
see
nearly
all
of
the
next
canyon
with
its
rapids
which
we
would
have
to
pass
through
the
canyon
the
major
had
called
whirlpool
on
his
first
trip
they
could
also
see
the
yampa
river
for
twenty
miles
and
discovered
the
coming
back
down
that
stream
their
attention
being
attracted
by
a
gunshot
in
that
direction
which
they
knew
could
be
only
from
our
own
men
in
camp
during
the
day
i
again
experimented
in
the
culinary
department
and
produced
two
pies
one
of
which
clem
and
i
ate
with
an
indescribable
zest
and
the
other
we
kept
to
astonish
the
absentees
with
when
they
should
reach
camp
i
have
since
learned
that
my
method
of
was
original
i
soaked
the
dried
apples
till
they
were
soft
then
made
a
crust
which
had
plenty
of
bacon
grease
in
it
for
shortening
and
put
the
apples
with
sugar
between
baking
the
production
in
the
dutch
oven
about
five
the
yampa
explorers
came
they
were
ragged
tired
and
hungry
having
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
and
not
enough
any
day
as
the
major
had
not
taken
sufficient
supplies
in
his
desire
to
make
the
boat
light
they
were
all
rather
cross
the
only
time
on
the
whole
expedition
that
such
a
state
existed
but
when
they
had
eaten
and
rested
their
genial
spirits
came
back
they
even
liked
my
pie
and
they
told
us
about
their
struggle
up
the
canyon
we
were
all
rather
sorry
to
pull
away
from
this
comfortable
camp
at
the
mouth
of
the
yampa
on
july
but
the
rapids
of
whirlpool
were
challenging
and
we
had
to
go
and
meet
them
at
the
foot
of
echo
park
the
green
doubles
directly
back
on
itself
for
a
mile
as
it
turns
echo
rock
the
narrow
peninsula
of
sandstone
feet
high
the
canyon
became
suddenly
very
close
and
assumed
a
formidable
appearance
we
listened
for
the
roar
of
a
rapid
but
for
some
time
nothing
was
heard
the
splendour
of
the
walls
impressed
us
deeply
rising
feet
many
coloured
carved
and
terraced
elaborately
our
admiration
was
interrupted
by
a
suggestive
roar
approaching
and
suddenly
a
violent
rapid
appeared
there
was
ample
room
and
we
got
below
it
by
a
that
is
by
lowering
the
boats
one
at
a
time
with
their
cargoes
on
board
along
the
margin
working
in
and
out
of
the
side
currents
then
we
had
dinner
while
waiting
for
the
which
had
remained
behind
for
pictures
a
part
of
my
work
was
to
make
a
continuous
outline
sketch
of
the
left
wall
for
the
use
of
the
geologists
and
this
i
was
able
to
do
as
we
went
along
i
had
a
pocket
on
the
bulkhead
in
front
of
my
seat
in
which
i
kept
a
sole
leather
portfolio
which
i
could
use
quickly
and
replace
in
the
waterproof
pocket
the
walls
of
the
canyon
became
more
flaring
as
soon
as
the
rapid
was
passed
at
noon
but
they
lost
none
of
their
majesty
we
now
expected
very
bad
river
and
whirlpools
from
the
experience
of
the
first
party
but
the
river
is
never
twice
alike
not
only
does
its
bottom
shift
but
every
variation
in
stage
of
water
brings
new
problems
or
does
away
with
them
entirely
it
was
an
agreeable
surprise
to
be
able
to
run
three
rapids
with
ease
by
four
when
we
saw
on
some
rocks
two
hundred
feet
above
the
stream
a
flock
of
mountain
sheep
an
immediate
landing
was
made
with
fresh
mutton
in
prospect
unluckily
our
guns
in
anticipation
of
severe
work
had
all
been
securely
packed
away
and
it
was
some
moments
before
they
could
be
brought
out
by
that
time
the
sheep
had
nimbly
gone
around
a
corner
of
the
wall
where
a
large
side
canyon
was
now
discovered
bringing
in
a
fine
creek
it
was
useless
to
follow
the
sheep
though
one
or
two
made
a
brief
trial
and
camp
was
made
in
a
cottonwood
grove
at
the
mouth
of
the
creek
cottonwoods
fringed
the
stream
as
far
as
it
could
be
seen
from
our
position
brush
creek
we
called
it
believing
it
to
be
the
mouth
of
a
stream
in
the
back
country
known
by
that
name
the
next
day
two
or
three
miles
up
a
branch
was
found
to
come
from
the
south
and
as
this
was
thought
to
be
brush
creek
the
larger
one
was
named
after
and
bishop
creek
was
put
on
our
map
doubtless
there
are
plenty
of
trout
in
this
creek
and
in
others
we
had
passed
but
we
had
no
proper
tackle
for
trout
and
besides
seldom
had
time
for
fishing
when
at
these
places
jack
when
not
too
tired
fished
in
the
green
and
generally
had
good
success
our
present
locality
would
have
been
a
rare
place
for
a
month
or
two
sojourn
had
we
been
sportsmen
with
time
on
our
hands
sheep
deer
and
bear
existed
in
abundance
as
well
as
smaller
game
but
we
had
to
forget
it
though
none
of
us
cared
about
shooting
for
fun
our
minds
were
on
other
things
often
we
went
out
leaving
rifles
behind
as
they
were
heavy

fourth
of
july
camp
photograph
by
beaman
scarcely
had
we
settled
ourselves
in
this
beautiful
camp
when
we
discovered
that
we
ourselves
were
the
hunted
and
by
an
enemy
that
we
could
not
vanquish
ants
there
was
no
place
in
the
neighbourhood
that
was
out
of
their
range
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
make
my
bed
two
feet
from
the
nearest
hill
and
let
them
have
their
way
morning
was
hailed
with
unusual
delight
for
this
reason
and
also
because
it
was
the
glorious
fourth
a
day
that
every
american
remembers
wherever
he
may
be
we
fired
several
rounds
as
a
salute
and
the
major
concluded
to
keep
this
camp
till
the
next
morning
to
enable
andy
to
have
a
day
off
and
a
climb
out
with
a
party
to
the
open
i
agreed
to
run
the
cook
outfit
and
felt
highly
complimented
that
they
were
willing
to
trust
me
after
the
pie
episode
i
immediately
resolved
to
try
my
skill
again
in
that
quarter
and
expected
to
astonish
the
camp
i
succeeded
the
bill
of
fare
which
i
evolved
was
ham
pie
dried
apples
stewed
canned
peaches
sugar
syrup
bread
coffee
and
some
candy
from
gunther
in
chicago
the
candy
had
been
presented
to
me
at
green
river
station
by
some
passing
friends
and
i
had
hidden
it
in
my
bag
waiting
for
this
grand
occasion
ham
was
quite
as
much
of
a
luxury
as
candy
for
we
had
started
with
but
three
or
four
and
only
used
them
on
special
days
as
for
the
canned
peaches
they
were
the
only
ones
we
had
the
supper
was
a
memorable
one
not
a
grumble
was
heard
from
anybody
indeed
they
all
praised
it
and
the
only
drawback
from
my
point
of
view
was
that
the
scouting
party
did
not
return
early
enough
to
taste
it
in
its
prime
the
major
threatened
to
expel
the
member
who
had
smuggled
in
the
candy
as
all
the
men
declared
they
would
go
no
farther
unless
they
could
have
a
plate
of
it
for
desert
at
every
meal
the
next
morning
we
were
on
the
river
early
glad
to
get
away
from
the
army
of
ants
the
canyon
walls
ran
along
at
about
the
same
height
as
on
the
previous
day
about
feet
and
while
the
river
was
swift
and
full
of
rapids
everything
seemed
to
favour
us
before
halting
for
dinner
we
had
run
five
rapids
three
rather
ugly
as
well
as
letting
down
past
one
with
lines
from
where
a
stop
was
made
for
andy
noonday
operations
a
flock
of
sheep
was
seen
on
the
opposite
side
and
several
went
after
them
with
no
result
but
disappointment
when
we
started
again
we
ran
a
rapid
at
once
then
let
down
past
the
next
and
followed
that
by
running
two
more
the
last
the
worst
the
boats
bumped
occasionally
on
hidden
rocks
but
no
harm
was
done
them
the
whole
canyon
was
exceedingly
beautiful
nevertheless
we
did
not
mourn
when
late
in
the
afternoon
just
after
running
the
last
rapid
the
magnificent
cliffs
fell
back
and
we
saw
more
sky
than
at
any
time
since
leaving
park
on
the
right
the
rocks
melted
away
into
beautiful
hills
while
on
the
left
they
remained
steep
though
retreating
a
mile
or
so
from
the
water
the
stretch
of
sky
seemed
enormous
breathing
appeared
to
be
easier
the
eye
grows
weary
with
the
short
range
views
and
yearns
for
space
in
which
to
roam
the
valley
we
were
now
in
was
not
long
about
four
miles
in
a
straight
line
with
a
width
of
two
in
this
space
the
river
meanders
nine
miles
one
detour
being
very
long
it
spreads
also
amongst
a
number
of
islands
and
the
numerous
channels
became
shallow
till
our
keels
grated
here
and
there
then
they
concentrated
once
more
and
we
floated
along
on
waters
deep
and
black
and
slow
the
marvellous
colouring
in
the
surrounding
landscape
impressed
us
and
the
major
was
for
a
time
uncertain
whether
to
call
this
rainbow
or
island
park
the
decision
finally
being
given
to
the
latter
shortly
before
sunset
our
meanderings
terminated
at
the
foot
of
the
valley
where
the
river
once
more
entered
the
rocks
in
a
gateway
as
abrupt
though
not
as
imposing
as
that
of
lodore
a
fine
grove
of
on
the
right
just
above
this
gate
offered
an
attractive
camping
place
and
there
we
stopped
we
were
now
in
utah
again
having
crossed
the
boundary
somewhere
in
whirlpool
canyon
the
altitude
was
feet
showing
a
descent
in
whirlpool
canyon
of
feet
in
a
distance
of
miles
the
next
day
i
went
with
beaman
and
clem
with
a
boat
back
to
the
foot
of
whirlpool
canyon
in
order
that
beaman
might
get
some
views
it
was
a
hard
pull
and
we
discovered
that
what
appears
sluggish
going
down
is
often
the
reverse
to
a
boat
going
up
we
could
make
headway
only
by
keeping
very
close
to
the
bank
it
was
when
we
again
reached
camp
the
major
now
announced
that
he
intended
to
take
the
and
go
on
ahead
without
stopping
anywhere
to
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
river
leaving
us
to
follow
as
we
could
in
doing
the
work
cap
was
to
be
taken
in
my
place
because
of
his
previous
experience
in
the
army
and
in
the
west
that
evening
all
was
made
ready
by
break
of
day
the
camp
was
astir
breakfast
was
disposed
of
as
quickly
as
possible
the
was
manned
the
major
went
to
his
place
on
the
middle
cabin
they
cast
off
and
disappeared
in
the
canyon
gate
we
then
called
this
craggy
canyon
but
later
it
was
changed
to
split
mountain
all
of
the
others
crossed
the
river
to
climb
to
the
top
of
the
cliffs
for
observations
and
for
photographs
i
was
left
alone
to
watch
camp
i
longed
to
experiment
further
in
the
cooking
line
and
discovering
a
bag
of
ground
coffee
leaning
against
the
foot
of
a
tree
i
said
to
myself
coffee
cake
i
had
heard
of
it
i
had
eaten
it
i
would
again
surprise
the
boys
i
had
no
eggs
no
butter
no
milk
condensed
milk
was
unknown
at
that
time
but
i
had
flour
water
cream
of
tartar
saleratus
sugar
salt
and
ground
coffee
i
thought
these
quite
enough
and
went
at
my
task
the
mixture
i
made
i
put
in
a
small
tin
and
baked
in
the
dutch
oven
i
was
so
much
occupied
with
this
interesting
experiment
that
i
forgot
all
about
time
and
about
having
something
substantial
ready
for
the
return
of
the
hungry
climbers
so
when
they
did
come
about
noon
as
famished
as
coyotes
and
dead
tired
all
i
could
offer
was
cake
ever
after
famous
on
that
trip
a
brown
sugary
solid
some
six
inches
in
diameter
two
inches
thick
and
betraying
its
flavour
everywhere
by
the
scattered
lavishly
through
it
andy
gave
it
one
brief
sad
look
and
then
went
to
work
to
get
dinner
but
they
were
such
a
rare
lot
of
good
fellows
that
they
actually
praised
that
cake
and
not
only
that
they
ate
it
the
cake
led
to
the
discovery
that
the
major
party
had
left
behind
all
their
coffee
which
was
what
i
had
used
for
flavouring
and
they
would
have
to
content
themselves
with
tea
from
the
heights
our
men
had
reached
they
could
see
with
a
glass
the
working
rapidly
down
the
river
next
day
another
party
went
up
to
the
same
place
and
i
went
along
the
photographic
outfit
had
been
left
there
because
rain
the
day
before
had
spoiled
the
view
and
we
were
to
bring
it
down
when
more
views
had
been
taken
after
a
strong
steep
climb
we
found
ourselves
on
a
peak
or
pinnacle
about
feet
above
the
river
and
therefore
above
the
view
from
this
point
was
extraordinary
far
below
gleamed
the
river
cleaving
the
rocks
at
our
feet
and
visible
for
several
miles
in
the
canyon
churning
its
way
down
the
rapids
indicated
by
bars
of
white
one
hardly
knew
which
way
to
look
crags
about
us
projected
into
the
canyon
and
i
was
inspired
to
creep
out
upon
a
long
finger
of
sandstone
where
i
could
sit
astride
as
on
a
horse
and
comfortably
peer
down
into
the
abyss
it
was
an
absolutely
safe
place
but
beaman
and
clem
feared
the
crag
might
break
off
with
me
and
they
compelled
me
to
come
back
to
relieve
their
minds
seldom
does
one
have
such
a
chance
to
see
below
as
well
as
i
could
there
the
long
narrow
mountain
stretched
off
to
the
west
seeming
not
more
than
a
wide
and
split
open
for
its
whole
length
by
the
river
which
has
washed
its
canyon
longitudinally
through
it
in
all
directions
were
mountains
canyons
and
crags
in
bewildering
profusion
when
beaman
had
ended
his
labours
we
started
down
the
cliffs
with
his
apparatus
this
was
the
terror
of
the
party
the
camera
in
its
strong
box
was
a
heavy
load
to
carry
up
the
rocks
but
it
was
nothing
to
the
chemical
and
box
which
in
turn
was
a
featherweight
compared
to
the
imitation
which
served
for
a
dark
room
this
dark
box
was
the
special
sorrow
of
the
expedition
as
it
had
to
be
dragged
up
the
heights
from
to
feet
with
this
machinery
we
reached
camp
pretty
tired
and
glad
to
rest
the
remainder
of
the
day
especially
as
said
we
would
enter
the
new
canyon
the
next
morning
this
was
sunday
a
few
minutes
after
starting
we
passed
between
perpendicular
strata
rising
out
of
the
water
and
gradually
bending
above
over
to
the
horizontal
then
breaking
into
crags
i
never
saw
anything
more
like
an
artificial
wall
so
evenly
were
the
rocky
beds
laid
one
against
another
as
we
passed
into
the
more
broken
portion
a
flock
of
sheep
came
into
view
high
up
on
the
crags
on
the
right
standing
motionless
evidently
puzzled
by
the
sound
of
our
oars
we
fired
from
the
moving
boats
but
without
result
recovering
from
their
surprise
the
sheep
bounded
lightly
away
our
attention
was
required
the
next
moment
by
a
rapid
which
we
ran
it
was
a
small
one
to
find
it
followed
by
many
thickly
set
with
rocks
at
the
first
we
let
down
by
line
for
half
a
mile
when
we
had
dinner
then
we
let
down
by
line
another
and
ran
half
a
mile
more
in
easy
water
to
the
head
of
a
very
bad
place
one
of
the
worst
we
had
seen
where
we
made
another
there
was
never
any
difficulty
about
landing
when
we
desired
which
made
the
work
comparatively
easy
the
got
some
hard
knocks
and
had
to
be
repaired
at
one
place
before
we
could
go
on
the
total
distance
made
was
only
about
three
miles
but
we
could
have
gone
farther
had
we
not
stopped
for
investigations
and
to
mend
the
boat
illustration
split
mountain
canyon
photograph
by
beaman
wet
and
weary
we
welcomed
the
order
to
camp
about
five
and
made
ourselves
comfortable
with
dry
clothes
from
our
rubber
bags
the
wet
ones
being
spread
as
was
our
custom
on
rocks
to
dry
at
high
water
many
of
these
rapids
would
be
rendered
much
easier
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
camp
was
a
small
cave
thirty
or
forty
feet
deep
very
picturesque
with
the
river
dashing
into
it
and
in
the
water
in
front
a
rock
twenty
feet
high
which
had
dropped
down
from
somewhere
above
beaman
got
a
very
good
picture
here
the
river
was
falling
fast
and
as
the
water
lowered
rocks
more
and
more
showed
themselves
in
the
rapids
low
water
increases
the
labour
but
it
increases
the
safety
as
well
for
the
velocity
is
less
and
the
boats
are
more
easily
controlled
the
next
day
july
we
did
not
start
on
down
the
river
till
one
then
we
lowered
the
boats
past
two
rapids
and
ran
six
of
which
four
were
very
bad
on
account
of
numerous
rocks
occasionally
a
boat
would
strike
but
none
was
injured
seriously
the
sun
was
directly
in
our
faces
blinding
us
and
a
high
wind
was
blowing
which
added
to
the
difficulties
the
walls
were
often
vertical
for
a
thousand
feet
or
more
and
the
river
was
wide
and
shallow
there
was
a
scorching
hot
sun
the
temperature
being
near
in
the
shade
the
rocks
and
even
the
sand
became
so
hot
that
they
were
uncomfortable
to
the
touch
but
there
was
one
advantage
in
this
dry
heat
our
clothes
were
soon
dry
during
this
day
we
landed
on
the
wrong
side
to
examine
one
rapid
and
had
to
run
it
from
there
both
boats
got
through
with
only
slight
raps
and
we
went
on
a
short
distance
to
camp
at
the
head
of
a
bad
descent
which
was
not
runable
at
this
stage
of
water
in
the
morning
a
was
easily
accomplished
and
we
ran
down
a
short
distance
farther
when
we
stopped
for
dinner
on
a
sandy
beach
the
sand
scorched
my
feet
for
i
had
been
without
shoes
for
several
days
all
our
shoes
were
giving
out
and
mine
were
the
first
to
go
completely
fortunately
beaman
had
an
extra
pair
of
army
brogans
which
he
lent
me
till
we
should
reach
uinta
i
had
ordered
by
advice
in
chicago
two
pairs
of
fine
shoes
at
thirteen
dollars
a
pair
but
i
now
discovered
that
i
ought
to
have
bought
shoes
at
two
dollars
instead
for
such
work
as
this
we
hoped
to
be
able
to
get
some
new
shoes
from
salt
lake
when
we
reached
the
uinta
river
and
again
would
be
in
touch
even
though
a
very
long
touch
with
the
outside
world
our
soap
was
all
gone
too
and
supplies
of
every
kind
were
getting
low
in
the
afternoon
three
more
rapids
were
run
and
at
a
fourth
we
were
compelled
to
make
a
then
we
saw
the
strata
begin
to
curve
over
and
down
and
finally
drop
into
the
river
just
as
they
had
come
out
of
it
at
the
beginning
the
crevices
were
filled
with
ferns
and
in
places
clear
water
was
dripping
from
these
little
green
cliff
gardens
as
we
ran
along
the
foot
of
the
left
wall
we
saw
a
peculiar
and
beautiful
spring
which
had
carved
out
a
dainty
basin
where
a
multitude
of
ferns
and
kindred
plants
were
thriving
a
silvery
rill
dropping
down
from
them
we
emerged
from
the
canyon
as
abruptly
as
we
had
entered
it
and
saw
a
broad
valley
stretching
before
us
running
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
a
smooth
river
camp
was
made
on
the
right
on
a
level
floor
carpeted
with
grass
and
surrounded
by
thickets
of
oak
we
were
in
the
beginning
of
what
is
now
called
wonsits
antelope
valley
about
miles
long
the
only
large
valley
on
the
river
above
the
end
of
black
canyon
canyon
eight
miles
long
has
one
of
the
greatest
declivities
on
the
river
coming
next
to
lodore
though
it
differs
from
the
latter
in
that
the
descent
is
more
continuous
and
not
broken
into
short
violent
stretches
there
would
be
plain
sailing
now
to
the
head
of
the
canyon

chapter

a

a

someone
comes
the
tale
of
a
mysterious
light
how
how
from
douglas
boy
at
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
a
tramp
to
goblin
city
and
a
trip
down
white
river
on
a
raft
a
of
supplies
from
salt

by
way
of
uinta
agency
the
major
goes
out
to
find
a
way
in
our
thoughts
now
were
mainly
directed
to
pushing
on
to
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
river
and
picking
up
our
advance
party
which
by
this
time
must
have
gotten
in
touch
with
the
uinta
agency
we
felt
gratified
that
another
of
the
long
line
of
canyons
was
a
thing
of
the
past
and
that
for
a
brief
time
we
would
have
easy
water
so
far
as
rapids
were
concerned
we
were
reminded
that
this
was
indian
country
by
discovering
on
a
smooth
face
of
rock
wall
not
far
from
camp
a
lot
of
drawings
pecked
into
the
stone
they
represented
figures
of
natives
bison
elk
deer
mountain
sheep
grizzly
tracks
and
as
they
were
the
first
pictographs
i
had
ever
seen
i
was
particularly
interested
the
bison
pictures
indicated
the
former
presence
here
in
this
valley
of
that
fine
animal
numbers
indeed
once
ranged
these
hills
and
valleys
but
they
had
all
disappeared
many
years
before
our
voyage
we
were
on
the
lookout
for
indians
as
long
as
we
were
encompassed
by
the
mighty
walls
of
the
canyons
there
was
little
probability
of
our
meeting
with
any
of
the
original
people
of
this
soil
but
the
valley
now
opening
wide
before
us
was
their
favourite
haunt
two
divisions
of
utes
roamed
the
surrounding
region
on
the
west
it
was
the
uinta
utes
who
we
knew
were
peaceable
and
on
the
east
it
was
the
white
river
utes
whose
status
as
to
peace
and
war
was
at
that
period
somewhat
vague
and
uncertain
we
expected
no
trouble
with
any
of
them
yet
the
possibility
of
running
at
any
moment
on
a
band
gave
added
interest
and
colour
to
the
voyage
this
was
intensified
by
the
feeling
that
we
had
suddenly
been
thrown
out
of
doors
unprotected
as
the
huge
dominating
precipices
broke
so
suddenly
back
on
both
sides
leaving
us
hardly
a
rock
with
which
in
case
of
necessity
to
emulate
the
example
of
roderick
dhu
probably
if
we
had
travelled
here
on
horseback
in
the
open
there
would
not
have
been
this
sense
of
having
left
our
fortification
behind
july
the
boats
proceeded
down
a
river
so
sluggish
that
the
term
down
seemed
a
misnomer
and
we
actually
had
to
row
had
to
work
at
the
oars
to
make
the
boats
go
these
same
boats
which
so
recently
had
behaved
like
wild
horses
this
was
not
to
our
taste
at
all
the
weather
being
extremely
hot
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
boats
fairly
went
to
sleep
and
we
tugged
away
at
their
dull
heavy
weight
putting
the
miles
behind
and
recalling
the
manner
of
their
recent
action
on
each
side
of
us
there
were
occasional
groves
of
cottonwoods
and
wide
bottoms
bounded
by
low
hills
after
about
ten
miles
of
steady
pulling
we
discovered
that
we
were
only
miles
from
our
starting
place
in
a
straight
line
here
there
was
a
superb
cottonwood
grove
massive
trees
with
huge
trunks
like
oaks
on
the
left
we
found
the
remains
of
a
and
decided
that
our
advance
party
had
come
this
far
from
island
park
the
first
day
they
had
accomplished
a
phenomenal
run
but
it
showed
what
might
be
done
with
light
boats
and
a
full
crew
as
steward
desired
to
make
some
geological
examinations
at
this
point
announced
that
we
would
stay
till
morning
another
cause
for
stopping
was
a
gale
which
blew
with
great
force
making
rowing
exceedingly
hard
work
and
it
was
hard
enough
anyhow
with
no
good
current
to
help
steward
wished
to
go
across
the
river
and
i
went
with
him
we
tramped
with
our
winchesters
on
our
shoulders
for
several
hours
examining
rocks
and
fossils
on
our
return
we
found
that
andy
was
occupied
in
boiling
a
goose
which
sure
aim
had
bestowed
on
the
larder
and
we
had
the
bird
for
supper
if
it
was
not
one
of
the
fossils
it
certainly
was
one
of
the
oldest
inhabitants
which
are
found
in
every
locality
and
though
a
steady
diet
of
bacon
enthused
us
with
an
ambition
to
masticate
this
noble
morsel
it
had
to
be
relegated
to
the
impossibilities
we
had
a
good
deal
of
entertainment
out
of
it
and
while
so
engaged
every
ear
caught
the
sound
of
a
faint
distant
gunshot
this
was
proof
that
we
were
no
longer
alone
and
the
question
was
how
many
indians
are
there
we
simply
waited
developments
night
came
on
and
the
fierce
wind
died
away
completely
as
the
sun
went
down
we
gave
no
more
thought
to
the
shot
but
all
went
to
bed
without
even
leaving
a
watch
so
confident
was
that
there
was
no
enemy
and
no
danger
of
a
surprise
he
was
always
and
never
went
off
on
a
tangent
doing
wild
or
unwarranted
things
he
was
a
man
of
unusually
sound
judgment
in
the
absence
of
cap
the
duty
of
reading
barometer
had
fallen
to
me
and
sometimes
when
waiting
for
the
hour
to
arrive
i
had
to
sit
alone
for
a
time
when
the
others
already
had
turned
in
it
was
that
way
on
this
night
and
i
waited
with
some
impatience
for
nine
to
come
for
the
purpose
of
reading
the
scale
we
used
a
small
lantern
belonging
to
a
transit
instrument
and
it
threw
out
a
long
beam
of
light
i
entertained
myself
by
flashing
this
beam
of
light
in
various
directions
to
the
distress
of
one
member
lying
near
not
asleep
who
was
somewhat
nervous
as
to
the
character
of
the
indians
responsible
for
the
shot
confound
it
he
growled
you
have
the
whole
ute
tribe
down
on
us
you
know
they
are
not
far
off
of
course
i
desisted
in
my
signalling
but
not
yet
asleep
spoke
up
saying
he
did
not
believe
any
indians
would
bother
us
finishing
the
observations
i
put
out
the
lantern
and
settled
in
my
blankets
at
that
instant
there
was
the
flash
of
a
light
through
the
trees
and
then
it
glowed
steadily
for
a
moment
and
went
out
my
nervous
neighbour
saw
it
too
there
he
cried
an
answer
to
your
confounded
signal
several
saw
it
the
evening
star
setting
beyond
the
hill
they
declared
derisively
but
we
two
maintained
that
it
was
nothing
less
than
a
light
near
by
then
sleep
ruled
the
camp
in
the
middle
of
the
night
there
was
a
sudden
terrific
cracking
rending
and
crashing
starting
all
to
their
feet
except
clem
who
was
not
wakened
by
it
what
had
happened
we
perceived
in
a
second
one
of
the
enormous
limbs
weakened
by
the
wind
had
broken
off
and
dropped
to
the
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
camp
luckily
no
one
was
under
it
and
no
harm
was
done
but
for
a
moment
in
connection
with
the
light
episode
and
the
gunshot
it
gave
us
a
shock
every
one
laughed
and
soon
the
camp
was
still
again
the
sun
was
well
up
before
we
awoke
immediately
the
discussion
of
the
strange
light
came
up
and
it
formed
a
lively
and
amusing
topic
not
only
then
but
ever
after
for
months
breakfast
became
a
stirring
debating
scene
when
plump
into
the
midst
of
our
hilarity
as
if
to
emphasise
the
declarations
of
the
nervous
member
there
came
a
sharp
call
from
beyond
a
line
of
bushes
almost
on
the
instant
appeared
an
indian
mounted
on
a
dark
bay
horse
trotting
towards
us
exclaiming
how
how
and
holding
out
his
hand
in
token
of
friendship
his
long
black
hair
hung
behind
in
two
tails
braided
with
red
and
black
cotton
cloth
the
scalp
at
the
part
was
painted
vermilion
and
around
each
eye
was
a
ring
of
the
same
bright
colour
his
shirt
was
of
the
kind
called
hickory
and
his
leggins
were
of
red
woollen
stuff
altogether
he
was
a
good
looking
specimen
of
his
race
and
about
years
old
how
many
more
might
be
behind
we
could
not
tell
he
dismounted
and
clem
grasped
him
warmly
by
the
hand
exclaiming
with
his
most
cordial
smile
well
how
are
all
the
folks
at
home
to
which
the
visitor
of
course
made
no
answer
not
one
of
our
party
understood
ute
and
i
had
never
seen
a
wild
indian
at
such
close
quarters
before
the
man
motioned
for
something
to
eat
so
andy
gave
him
a
plate
of
breakfast
but
there
was
a
twinkle
in
andy
blue
eye
for
the
breakfast
consisted
largely
of
the
rejected
goose
when
the
red
man
vision
rested
on
the
goose
he
gave
a
grunt
of
disgust
and
made
no
effort
to
even
taste
it
though
he
relished
the
other
things
and
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
i
have
noticed
that
all
indians
are
very
fond
of
coffee
we
gleaned
that
he
was
alone
with
his
squaw
and
had
a
wickiup
down
the
river
a
short
distance
doubtless
he
had
examined
our
camp
the
previous
night
the
barometer
hanging
to
a
caught
his
eye
and
i
tried
by
signs
to
explain
it
to
him
with
no
success
except
to
convulse
the
whole
crew
at
length
with
the
exclamation
squaw
he
rode
away
and
came
back
with
his
fair
partner
riding
behind
by
this
time
we
were
packed
up
and
we
pushed
off
the
pair
watching
us
with
deep
interest
about
a
mile
and
a
half
below
by
the
river
we
came
on
them
again
at
their
camp
they
having
easily
beaten
us
by
a
short
cut
here
was
his
wickiup
made
of
a
few
cottonwood
boughs
and
in
front
of
it
the
ashes
of
a
fire
our
side
immediately
claimed
this
was
the
light
we
had
seen
and
the
discussion
of
this
point
continued
until
another
night
put
an
end
to
it
in
the
bough
shelter
sat
the
blooming
bride
of
douglas
boy
as
he
called
himself
douglas
being
the
chief
of
the
white
river
utes
she
was
dressed
well
in
a
neat
suit
of
flannel
and
was
lavishly
adorned
with
ornaments
her
dress
was
bound
at
the
waist
by
a
heavy
belt
of
leather
four
inches
wide
profusely
decorated
with
brass
discs
and
fastened
by
a
brass
buckle
she
was
young
and
quite
pretty
and
they
were
a
handsome
couple
he
intimated
that
he
would
be
grateful
to
be
ferried
across
the
river
here
almost
half
a
mile
wide
so
his
blankets
saddles
and
whole
paraphernalia
were
piled
on
the
boats
while
the
two
horses
were
driven
into
the
water
and
pelted
with
stones
till
they
made
up
their
minds
that
the
farther
shore
offered
greater
hospitality
and
swam
for
it
then
the
squaw
and
the
brave
were
taken
on
separate
boats
she
hesitated
long
before
finally
trusting
herself
and
was
exceedingly
coy
about
it
she
had
probably
never
seen
a
boat
before
at
last
overcoming
her
fear
she
stepped
tremblingly
on
board
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
had
them
landed
on
the
other
side
where
we
said
farewell
and
went
on
in
the
afternoon
we
discovered
a
number
of
natives
on
the
right
bank
and
landed
to
see
what
they
were
nothing
more
terrible
than
several
badly
frightened
squaws
and
children
occupied
the
place
the
men
being
away
we
thought
this
call
on
the
ladies
would
suffice
and
presenting
them
with
a
quantity
of
tobacco
for
their
absent
lords
we
pulled
away
leaving
them
still
almost
paralysed
with
fright
and
astonishment
at
our
sudden
and
unexpected
appearance
and
disappearance
the
valley
was
now
very
wide
and
the
river
spread
to
a
great
width
also
giving
conditions
totally
different
from
any
we
had
found
above
rowing
was
real
labour
here
but
was
eager
to
arrive
at
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
the
next
day
so
it
was
row
row
with
a
strong
steady
monotonous
stroke
hour
after
hour
till
we
had
put
twenty
miles
behind
when
we
stopped
for
the
night
next
morning
the
same
programme
was
continued
from
seven
on
with
a
brief
halt
for
dinner
about
four
a
storm
came
up
compelling
us
to
wait
an
hour
when
on
we
pulled
with
a
temperature
something
like
in
the
shade
till
sunset
when
about
forty
miles
from
our
starting
point
we
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
a
river
on
the
right
which
we
thought
must
be
the
uinta
but
finally
as
there
was
no
sign
of
our
advance
party
we
concluded
there
must
be
a
mistake
there
was
so
little
current
in
the
tributary
we
thought
it
might
be
something
besides
a
river
the
mouth
of
a
lake
perhaps
and
that
the
uinta
was
farther
on
about
a
mile
down
in
the
dim
light
there
appeared
to
be
a
river
mouth
but
on
reaching
the
place
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
several
signal
shots
were
fired
they
fell
dead
on
the
dull
stillness
of
the
night
which
was
dropping
fast
upon
us
we
took
to
the
oars
once
more
and
pulled
down
nearly
another
mile
till
the
dark
grew
so
thick
it
was
not
prudent
to
proceed
and
ordered
a
landing
on
the
left
where
we
made
a
hasty
cup
of
coffee
to
refresh
the
inner
man
and
turned
in
much
puzzled
and
troubled
by
the
absence
of
any
kind
of
a
signal
from
the
advance
party
some
one
suggested
that
they
had
all
been
killed
but
met
this
with
scornful
ridicule
and
went
to
sleep
when
daylight
came
a
river
was
discovered
less
than
half
a
mile
below
our
camp
coming
in
from
the
east
knew
this
to
be
white
river
from
the
map
the
mouths
of
white
and
uinta
rivers
having
long
been
quite
accurately
established
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
must
therefore
be
where
we
had
been
the
night
before
and
walked
back
till
he
came
opposite
to
it
we
then
got
the
boats
back
by
rowing
and
towing
and
landed
on
the
right
or
west
bank
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
above
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
where
the
old
time
crossing
had
been
and
which
we
had
passed
unnoticed
in
the
evening
light
here
were
the
ashes
of
a
and
after
much
searching
a
tin
can
was
found
with
a
note
in
it
from
the
major
saying
they
had
all
gone
out
to
the
agency
and
that
we
were
to
wait
here
a
large
cottonwood
tree
stood
on
the
low
bank
where
travellers
before
had
camped
not
in
going
up
and
down
the
river
but
on
their
way
across
country
it
was
a
very
old
tree
and
its
bark
presented
many
marks
names
and
dates
and
i
regret
now
that
i
did
not
copy
them
for
reference
this
was
one
of
the
known
crossings
for
a
long
period
in
fact
it
was
through
this
valley
that
escalante
the
first
white
man
to
cross
green
river
travelled
in
and
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
camped
under
this
very
tree
we
settled
there
to
wait
harassed
by
multitudes
of
voracious
mosquitoes
all
day
we
remained
expecting
the
absentees
but
the
sun
went
down
and
still
there
was
no
word
about
seven
while
we
were
eating
supper
some
shots
and
yells
from
the
west
took
us
to
the
top
of
the
bank
and
we
saw
two
horsemen
galloping
towards
our
position
we
soon
made
them
out
to
be
cap
and
jones
they
brought
a
large
mail
a
portion
of
it
the
same
we
had
tried
to
stop
at
salt
lake
and
have
returned
to
us
at
the
gate
of
lodore
and
they
reported
that
the
major
had
gone
out
to
salt
lake
we
built
up
a
good
fire
and
by
its
light
everyone
was
quickly
lost
in
letters
from
home
the
next
morning
we
got
the
out
of
the
bushes
where
she
had
been
well
hidden
and
moved
across
the
river
with
the
whole
outfit
to
a
place
in
front
of
a
log
cabin
called
fort
robideau
after
the
trapper
of
that
name
who
years
before
had
roamed
this
country
a
road
crossing
here
from
golden
to
provo
miles
long
was
laid
out
in
by
berthoud
and
bridger
for
the
overland
stage
company
but
the
civil
war
and
the
building
of
the
union
pacific
had
prevented
its
realisation
the
cabin
had
no
windows
or
doors
but
for
summer
that
was
not
a
defect
the
mud
roof
was
intact
and
we
used
the
cabin
for
headquarters
though
we
preferred
to
sleep
out
on
the
ground
back
of
the
building
a
wide
level
plain
spread
away
and
deer
and
antelope
ranged
there
in
large
numbers
any
short
walk
would
start
up
antelope
but
we
had
other
matters
on
our
mind
and
made
no
special
effort
to
shoot
any
it
would
have
been
easy
for
a
trained
hunter
to
get
all
he
wanted
or
even
for
one
of
us
to
do
it
had
we
dropped
other
things
and
given
our
minds
to
the
work
the
following
monday
july
and
beaman
left
for
the
agency
and
on
friday
of
the
same
week
jack
returned
accompanied
by
a
man
named
basor
driving
a
large
waggon
loaded
with
supplies
for
us
we
were
in
need
of
them
we
had
been
completely
out
of
soap
for
two
weeks
or
more
and
a
box
of
that
essential
article
was
broken
open
the
first
thing
jack
also
brought
from
the
agency
garden
some
lettuce
new
potatoes
and
turnips
not
having
tasted
any
vegetables
for
two
months
these
were
a
great
treat
the
same
afternoon
basor
went
away
taking
letters
from
us
with
him
to
be
sent
to
salt
lake
one
of
the
special
things
he
had
brought
was
three
long
narrow
pieces
of
flat
iron
made
by
the
agency
blacksmith
from
old
wagon
tires
for
the
keels
of
the
boats
which
were
badly
worn
by
scraping
on
shoals
and
rocks
in
our
portaging
and
operations
on
the
next
monday
steward
and
i
with
five
days
rations
on
our
backs
as
well
as
blankets
enough
for
the
warm
nights
and
our
rifles
started
on
a
journey
up
white
river
to
a
place
called
goblin
city
by
one
of
the
earlier
explorers
who
had
crossed
the
valley
as
we
were
going
through
some
heavy
willows
about
noon
i
discovered
standing
still
before
me
and
not
a
hundred
feet
away
the
finest
stag
i
have
ever
seen
he
stood
like
a
landseer
picture
head
erect
and
alert
with
huge
branching
antlers
poised
in
the
air
he
was
listening
to
my
companions
who
were
a
little
distance
from
me
my
gun
being
tied
to
my
pack
for
easy
travelling
i
could
not
quickly
extricate
it
and
before
i
could
bring
it
to
bear
he
dashed
through
the
willows
and
a
sensible
shot
was
impossible
i
admired
him
so
much
that
i
was
rather
glad
i
could
not
shoot
we
came
across
a
great
deal
of
game
antelope
mountain
sheep
and
deer
but
we
never
seemed
to
have
the
opportunity
to
stalk
it
properly
when
we
finally
came
in
sight
of
the
goblin
city
it
was
six
of
the
second
day
and
we
had
travelled
steadily
at
the
farther
end
of
a
level
little
valley
surrounded
by
cliffs
were
numerous
small
buttes
and
square
rocks
almost
in
rows
and
about
the
size
of
small
buildings
so
that
there
was
a
striking
suggestion
of
a
town
we
slept
near
the
river
and
spent
the
next
morning
in
examining
the
locality
when
we
had
completed
the
observations
i
got
dinner
while
steward
and
cap
with
our
and
some
buckskin
strings
made
a
raft
from
small
cottonwood
logs
we
found
on
the
bank
upon
this
weaving
affair
we
all
three
embarked
to
descend
the
river
in
order
to
meander
the
course
as
well
as
to
save
our
legs
steward
and
cap
stood
at
either
end
with
long
poles
while
i
sat
in
the
middle
and
took
the
compass
sights
as
we
passed
along
there
were
some
sharp
little
rapids
full
of
rocks
and
sometimes
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
stick
on
for
the
raft
being
flexible
naturally
would
straddle
a
big
rock
and
take
the
form
of
a
very
steep
house
roof
the
banks
were
thick
with
currant
bushes
loaded
with
ripe
fruit
and
we
kept
a
supply
of
branches
on
the
raft
to
pick
off
the
currants
as
we
went
along
everywhere
there
were
many
fresh
tracks
of
bears
for
they
are
fond
of
this
fruit
but
if
they
saw
us
we
failed
to
see
them
though
some
of
the
tracks
appeared
to
have
been
made
not
more
than
a
few
minutes
before
as
we
drifted
between
high
banks
there
was
a
violent
crashing
of
bushes
and
a
beautiful
fawn
evidently
pursued
by
bear
or
wolf
plunged
through
and
dropped
into
the
stream
cap
took
a
shot
at
it
from
the
wobbling
raft
but
of
course
failed
the
fawn
landed
at
the
bottom
of
a
mud
wall
ten
feet
high
and
for
a
moment
seemed
dazed
but
by
some
herculean
effort
it
gained
the
plain
and
sped
away
to
freedom
and
we
were
not
at
all
sorry
to
see
it
go
all
the
next
day
we
kept
on
down
white
river
on
the
raft
and
at
seven
were
still
five
miles
from
camp
in
a
direct
course
and
no
food
left
as
the
stream
meandered
a
great
deal
we
parted
from
it
and
went
to
headquarters
on
foot
we
now
expected
hourly
the
return
of
and
the
major
but
another
day
passed
without
them
or
any
message
the
next
day
was
saturday
and
it
faded
away
also
without
any
event
just
after
supper
there
was
a
hail
from
the
west
bank
and
on
going
over
with
a
boat
we
found
there
beaman
and
an
indian
the
major
had
not
come
because
captain
dodds
commanding
the
party
which
was
charged
with
the
taking
of
rations
for
us
to
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
river
our
next
supply
station
had
sent
word
that
he
could
not
find
a
way
through
the
unknown
region
the
major
concluded
that
he
would
have
to
go
and
try
it
himself
his
plan
was
for
us
to
go
on
and
he
would
join
us
again
august
at
gunnison
crossing
at
the
end
of
the
canyon
of
desolation
the
next
canyon
of
the
series
gunnison
crossing
was
an
established
point
with
a
trail
leading
there
from
east
and
west
we
were
to
wait
for
him
till
september
in
that
neighbourhood
and
if
he
failed
to
arrive
we
were
to
go
on
and
get
through
as
best
we
could
on
the
rations
remaining
our
present
intercourse
with
the
world
was
now
terminated
by
our
sending
the
indian
who
had
come
with
back
to
the
agency
with
our
mail
had
brought
in
some
fresh
beef
which
was
a
great
treat
but
there
was
little
of
it
and
after
a
couple
of
meals
we
were
on
bacon
and
beans
again
had
an
indian
from
the
agency
been
hired
for
the
purpose
of
hunting
we
might
have
had
plenty
of
venison
during
our
stop
here
sunday
our
old
acquaintance
douglas
boy
came
to
camp
and
was
employed
to
make
moccasins
to
save
our
shoes
some
new
shoes
had
been
sent
in
to
us
but
for
climbing
and
walking
the
moccasins
were
excellent
and
would
save
our
shoes
for
river
work
the
indian
had
a
beaded
cap
pouch
which
i
secured
from
him
for
some
vermilion
and
he
was
ready
to
trade
but
the
next
day
jack
caught
him
trying
to
steal
our
buckskin
by
hiding
it
in
his
blankets
which
rudely
sundered
our
business
relations
jack
himself
acquired
the
art
of
and
he
made
each
of
us
an
excellent
pair
in
his
spare
time
steward
and
i
went
back
up
white
river
to
finish
our
work
but
the
raft
timbers
were
gone
and
we
could
find
no
others
so
we
had
to
do
what
we
could
on
foot
when
we
returned
i
discovered
some
ginger
among
the
supplies
and
thinking
it
time
for
variety
in
our
bill
of
fare
and
it
being
cap
birthday
i
made
a
large
which
was
voted
prime
we
ate
half
of
it
at
one
sitting
with
an
accompaniment
of
lemonade
at
the
agency
found
out
that
douglas
boy
had
eloped
from
the
white
river
country
with
his
squaw
who
was
betrothed
to
another
and
when
we
first
met
him
he
was
engaged
in
eluding
pursuit
according
to
ute
law
if
he
could
avoid
capture
for
a
certain
time
he
would
be
free
to
return
without
molestation
to
his
village
beaman
photographed
him
and
a
number
of
the
uintas
under
the
direction
of
the
major
who
wished
to
secure
all
the
information
possible
about
the
natives
their
language
customs
and
costumes
we
now
spent
several
days
arranging
our
new
supplies
in
the
rubber
sacks
putting
the
iron
strips
on
the
and
doing
what
final
repairing
was
necessary
the
topographers
plotted
the
map
work
and
all
finished
up
their
necessary
notes
and
data
by
the
afternoon
of
friday
august
all
was
in
readiness
for
continuing
the
voyage
we
had
now
descended
feet
from
our
starting
point
towards
and
we
knew
that
the
next
canyon
would
add
considerably
to
these
figures

we
pushed

for

with
the

in
the
canyon

just
before
us
the
order
of
going
was
slightly
changed
in
the
absence

the

for
being
now
in

command
went

with

the
while
ours
the
for

being
took

the
river
for
a
brief
distance
ran
smoothly
with
only
enough
current
about
two
miles
an
hour
to
help
us
along
without
hard
rowing
i
missed
the
major
while
we
were
on
the
water
probably
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
party
for
as
we
were
facing
each
other
the
whole
time
and
were
not
separated
enough
to
interfere
with
conversation
we
had
frequent
talks
he
sometimes
described
incidents
which
happened
on
the
first
voyage
or
told
me
something
about
the
men
of
that
famous
and
unrivalled
journey
besides
this
he
was
very
apt
to
sing
especially
where
the
river
was
not
turbulent
and
the
outlook
was
tranquil
some
favourite
song
and
these
songs
greatly
interested
me
while
he
had
no
fine
voice
he
sang
from
his
heart
and
the
songs
were
those
he
had
learned
at
home
singing
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
one
of
these
was
an
hymn
home
of
the
or
rather
the
first
two
verses
of
it
these
verses
were
among
his
special
favourites
i
will
sing
you
a
song
of
that
beautiful
land
the
far
away
home
of
the
soul
where
no
storms
ever
beat
on
the
glittering
strand
while
the
years
of
eternity
roll
while
the
years
of
eternity
roll
where
no
storms
ever
beat
on
the
glittering
strand
while
the
years
of
eternity
roll
oh
that
home
of
the
soul
in
my
visions
and
dreams
its
bright
jasper
walls
i
can
see
till
i
fancy
but
thinly
the
veil
intervenes
between
the
fair
city
and
me
till

etc
another
was
a
pretty
song
laugh
of
a
of
which
he
sang
the
air
the
words
ran
i
love
it
i
love
it
the
laugh
of
a
child
now
rippling
now
gentle
now
merry
and
wild
it
rings
through
the
air
with
an
innocent
gush
like
the
trill
of
a
bird
at
the
twilight
soft
hush
it
floats
on
the
breeze
like
the
tones
of
a
bell
or
music
that
dwells
in
the
heart
of
a
shell
oh
the
laugh
of
a
child
is
so
wild
and
so
free
is
the
merriest
sound
in
the
world
to
me

me
one
day
that
this
fondness
for
singing
especially
amid
extremely
unpromising
or
gloomy
circumstances
had
on
more
than
one
occasion
led
the
men
of
the
first
expedition
to
suspect
his
sanity
when
he
was
singing
i
could
see
that
frequently
he
was
really
not
thinking
about
his
song
at
all
but
of
something
quite
foreign
to
it
and
the
singing
was
a
mere
accompaniment
our
party
as
a
whole
commanded
an
extensive
repertory
of
song
for
an
exploring
expedition
and
while
most
of
the
voices
were
somewhat
below
concert
requirement
there
was
no
one
to
object
and
one
of
us
jack
did
have
an
excellent
voice
a
song
often
heard
was
of
and
also
that
one
most
appropriate
are
the
wild
waves
saying
then
there
was
i
had
but
a
thousand
a
year
gaffer
and
of
course
never
was
there
an
american
or
an
english
expedition
to
anywhere
that
did
not
have
that
song
as
well
as
down
upon
the
suwanee
in
addition
to
all
these
and
the
ones
previously
mentioned
of
which
oh
the
lone
starry
hours
give
me
love
when
still
is
the
beautiful
night
was
a
special
favourite
jack
individual
repertory
contained
an
exhaustless
number
both
sad
and
gay
there
were
me
back
to
old
sailor
with
her
golden
hair
who
brought
sunshine
and
swallows
indiscriminately
to
each
locality
which
she
graced
with
the
said
golden
hair
and
where
my
love
lies
nellie
and
scores
or
at
least
dozens
that
i
fail
to
recall
but
while
we
had
a
great
store
of
songs
we
were
deficient
to
the
last
degree
in
musical
instruments
the
one
solitary
example
being
an
humble
which
in
a
moment
of
weakness
i
had
thrown
in
with
my
outfit
we
just
escaped
having
a
flute
frank
who
left
us
on
the
of
june
possessed
one
and
when
he
was
preparing
to
go
steward
negotiated
for
this
instrument
he
gave
cap
his
revolver
to
trade
for
it
considering
the
flute
more
desirable
property
for
the
expedition
being
an
old
soldier
concluded
to
fire
at
a
mark
before
letting
the
revolver
pass
forever
from
our
possession
presently
there
was
an
explosion
which
demolished
the
pistol
and
all
our
prospects
of
acquiring
the
musical
treasure
at
one
and
the
same
moment
possibly
fortune
was
kinder
to
us
than
we
dreamed
the
then
remained
the
sole
music
machine
in
all
that
immense
area
i
did
not
feel
equal
to
the
position
of
organist
but
steward
boldly
took
up
the
study
and
practised
so
faithfully
that
he
became
a
real
virtuoso
as
a
boy
in
new
york
jack
though
not
a
hibernian
himself
had
associated
closely
with
descendants
of
the
shamrock
isle
and
he
could
speak
with
a
fine
emerald
brogue
a
refrain
of
one
of
his
songs
in
this
line
was
and
if
the
rocks
they
do
sthop
us
we
will
cross
to
killiloo
this
sounded
our
situation
exactly
and
it
became
a
regular
accompaniment
to
the
roaring
of
the
rapids
jack
had
many
times
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
thirteen
eagles
fire
company
one
of
the
bright
jewels
with
a
green
setting
of
the
old
volunteer
service
the
foreman
fitting
the
rest
of
the
company
was
irish
too
and
his
stentorian
shout
through
the
trumpet
tirtaan
aigles
dis
wai
never
failed
to
rise
above
the
din
and
when
the
joyful
cry
smote
the
ears
of
the
gallant
tirtaan
the
rocks
nor
the
ruts
nor
the
crowds
nor
anything
could
stop
them
through
thick
and
through
thin
they
went
to
the
front
for
there
was
rivalry
in
those
days
and
when
the
aigles
time
after
time
got
first
water
on
they
won
triumphs
which
we
of
this
mercenary
epoch
can
not
understand
the
aigles
were
in
for
glory
nothing
else
so
when
we
heard
the
roar
of
a
rapid
and
sniffed
the
mist
in
the
air
tirtaan
aigles
dis
wai
was
our
slogan
where
the
river
now
ran
smoothly
as
it
did
for
a
considerable
distance
below
the
robideau
crossing
we
could
drift
with
the
slow
current
and
enjoy
the
study
of
the
surroundings
the
boats
requiring
no
attention
passing
the
mouths
of
the
uinta
and
the
white
both
rivers
entering
very
quietly
through
a
level
valley
we
pulled
gently
along
watching
the
banks
for
something
new
when
we
had
thus
gone
a
couple
of
miles
we
discovered
our
first
acquaintance
of
this
valley
douglas
boy
encamped
on
the
right
with
his
runaway
bride
they
had
a
snug
and
secluded
protected
by
the
river
and
some
low
cliffs
we
landed
to
pay
our
parting
call
both
had
their
faces
completely
smeared
with
the
bright
vermilion
obtained
by
trade
from
us
and
they
presented
in
our
eyes
a
ludicrous
appearance
they
had
recently
killed
a
fat
deer
and
seemed
very
happy
exchanged
some
sugar
for
enough
venison
for
our
dinner
and
we
said
farewell
to
them
the
first
as
well
as
the
last
human
beings
we
had
met
with
in
this
valley
clem
as
usual
gave
them
various
messages
for
the
folks
at
home
and
assured
them
with
gracious
smiles
that
they
would
ever
be
the
subject
of
his
most
distinguished
consideration
they
smiled
after
us
and
we
were
soon
beyond
their
vision
presently
low
cliffs
to
feet
began
to
show
themselves
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
the
wide
valley
vanished
the
great
canyon
below
was
reaching
out
for
us
there
were
numerous
islands
covered
with
immense
accumulations
of
driftwood
or
with
growing
cottonwoods
where
high
enough
hundreds
of
beaver
swam
about
occasionally
a
shot
from
the
boats
would
kill
or
wound
one
but
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
secure
any
as
they
seemed
to
sink
immediately
to
the
bottom
and
we
gave
up
trying
as
long
as
they
were
in
deep
water
the
stream
being
so
tranquil
reading
poetry
was
more
to
our
taste
than
hunting
the
beaver
and
read
aloud
from
emerson
as
we
slowly
advanced
upon
the
enemy
after
about
nine
miles
of
this
sort
of
thing
we
stopped
for
dinner
in
a
pretty
cottonwood
grove
at
the
foot
of
a
cliff
on
the
right
with
beaver
swimming
around
as
if
they
did
not
know
what
a
human
being
was
when
our
venison
had
been
disposed
of
the
boats
were
shoved
out
into
the
river
again
and
we
continued
our
approach
to
the
canyon
the
surrounding
region
became
a
desolate
waste
a
broken
desert
plateau
elevated
above
us
about
two
hundred
feet
some
deer
seen
on
an
island
caused
us
to
land
and
try
to
get
a
good
shot
at
one
but
we
failed
to
get
near
enough
for
success
and
they
quickly
disappeared
the
ground
was
too
difficult
for
pursuit
after
some
seventeen
miles
camp
for
the
night
was
made
in
another
grove
of
rather
small
cottonwoods
at
we
were
on
a
large
island
with
the
surrounding
waters
thick
with
beaver
busy
every
moment
though
their
great
work
is
done
at
night
many
trees
felled
some
of
them
of
a
considerable
diameter
attested
the
skill
and
energy
of
these
animals
as
woodchoppers
cap
tried
to
get
one
so
that
we
could
eat
it
but
though
he
killed
several
he
failed
to
reach
them
before
they
sank
and
gave
it
up
as
we
looked
around
we
saw
that
almost
imperceptibly
we
had
entered
the
new
canyon
and
at
this
camp
we
were
fairly
within
the
embrace
of
its
rugged
cliffs
which
devoid
of
all
vegetation
rose
up
four
hundred
feet
sombre
in
colour
but
picturesque
from
a
tendency
to
columnar
weathering
that
imparted
to
them
a
gothic
character
suggestive
of
cathedrals
castles
and
turrets
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
as
beaman
felt
sick
and
we
were
not
in
a
hurry
no
advance
was
made
but
instead
accompanied
by
steward
and
jones
climbed
out
for
notes
and
observations
they
easily
reached
the
top
by
means
of
a
small
gulch
they
got
back
early
reporting
an
increasing
desolation
in
the
country
on
both
sides
as
far
as
they
could
see
they
also
saw
two
graves
of
great
age
covered
by
stones
in
the
afternoon
entertained
us
by
reading
aloud
from
scott
and
so
the
day
passed
and
night
fell
then
the
beavers
became
more
active
and
worked
and
splashed
around
camp
incessantly
they
kept
it
up
all
through
the
dark
hours
as
is
their
habit
but
only
steward
was
disturbed
by
it
this
would
have
been
an
excellent
opportunity
to
learn
something
about
their
ways
but
for
my
part
i
did
not
then
even
think
of
it
by
in
the
morning
of
august
we
were
again
on
our
way
towards
the
depths
ahead
between
walls
of
rapidly
increasing
altitude
showing
that
we
were
cutting
into
some
great
rock
structure
here
and
there
we
came
to
shoals
that
compelled
us
to
get
overboard
and
wade
alongside
lifting
the
boats
at
times
as
these
shoals
had
the
peculiarity
of
beginning
gradually
and
ending
very
abruptly
we
got
some
unexpected
plunge
baths
during
this
kind
of
progression
but
the
air
was
hot
the
thermometer
being
about
and
being
soaked
through
was
not
uncomfortable
at
one
place
succeeded
in
shooting
a
beaver
which
was
near
the
bank
and
it
was
secured
before
it
could
get
to
its
hole
being
badly
wounded
steward
caught
it
around
the
middle
from
behind
and
threw
it
into
the
boat
he
had
jumped
into
the
water
and
there
it
was
finished
with
an
oar
it
measured
three
feet
from
tip
to
tip
we
had
heard
a
good
deal
about
beaver
as
food
and
would
now
have
a
chance
to
try
it
about
eleven
we
stopped
for
examinations
and
for
dinner
on
the
right
but
of
course
could
not
yet
cook
the
beaver
steward
and
cap
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
butte
feet
above
the
river
upon
which
they
found
a
small
monument
left
there
by
the
major
on
the
former
trip
though
this
butte
was
so
high
the
average
of
the
walls
was
only
about
five
hundred
feet
we
made
seventeen
miles
this
day
that
night
our
camp
no
was
again
on
an
island
there
cap
skinned
and
dressed
the
beaver
and
turned
over
the
edible
portions
to
andy
who
cooked
some
steak
for
breakfast
the
next
morning
it
tasted
something
like
beef
but
we
were
not
enthusiastic
for
i
fear
this
beaver
belonged
to
the
same
geological
epoch
as
the
goose
we
had
cooked
at
the
upper
end
of
the
valley
fortified
by
the
beaver
steak
we
pushed
off
and
ran
about
a
mile
on
a
smooth
river
when
a
stop
was
made
for
pictures
and
geologising
this
consumed
the
whole
morning
a
fact
andy
took
advantage
of
to
make
some
beaver
soup
for
dinner
this
concoction
was
voted
not
a
success
and
we
turned
to
bacon
and
beans
as
preferable
thereafter
opposite
this
dinner
place
was
a
rough
lateral
canyon
full
of
turrets
and
minarets
which
had
the
remarkable
property
of
twice
distinctly
repeating
a
shout
as
loud
as
the
original
and
multiplying
a
rifle
shot
to
peals
of
thunder
there
had
been
people
here
before
any
white
men
for
steward
found
an
artificial
wall
across
an
indentation
of
the
cliff
the
first
work
of
the
ancient
builders
we
had
encountered
it
was
mysterious
at
the
time
the
ruins
having
then
not
been
discovered
with
one
or
two
exceptions
we
ascribed
this
wall
however
to
the
ancestors
of
the
moki
hopi
in
the
afternoon
as
we
pulled
along
we
came
to
a
small
rapid
and
the
walls
by
this
time
being
closer
together
and
growing
constantly
higher
we
knew
that
we
were
now
fairly
within
the
canyon
of
desolation
and
for
about
one
hundred
miles
would
have
a
rough
river
not
more
than
two
miles
below
our
dinner
camp
we
reached
a
locality
where
the
stream
doubled
back
on
itself
forming
a
vast
and
beautiful
amphitheatre
we
could
not
pass
this
by
without
taking
a
picture
of
it
and
beaman
was
soon
at
work
with
his
apparatus
while
i
got
out
my
pencils
the
photograph
did
not
turn
out
well
and
determined
to
remain
till
the
next
day
our
camp
was
on
the
left
in
a
thick
grove
of
cottonwoods
and
or
maples
at
the
end
of
the
point
as
the
sun
sank
away
bats
flew
about
and
an
insect
orchestra
began
a
demoniacal
concert
that
shrilled
through
the
night
and
made
us
feel
like
slaughtering
the
myriads
if
we
could
the
noises
ceased
with
the
day
or
most
of
them
though
some
seemed
to
intensify
with
the
light
we
helped
beaman
get
his
dark
box
and
other
paraphernalia
up
to
the
summit
of
the
ridge
back
of
camp
which
was
easy
so
far
as
climbing
was
concerned
the
rocks
rising
by
a
series
of
shelves
or
steps
i
made
several
pencil
sketches
there
which
i
have
never
seen
since
the
close
of
the
expedition
the
crest
of
the
promontory
was
about
forty
yards
wide
at
its
maximum
and
three
yards
at
the
minimum
with
a
length
of
of
a
mile
from
the
middle
ridge
one
could
look
down
into
the
river
on
both
sides
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
stone
could
almost
be
thrown
into
each
from
one
standpoint
the
opposite
amphitheatre
was
perhaps
one
thousand
feet
high
beautifully
carved
by
the
rains
and
winds
it
was
named
sumner
amphitheatre
after
jack
sumner
of
the
first
expedition
several
of
our
men
climbed
in
different
directions
but
all
did
not
succeed
in
getting
out
the
day
turned
out
very
cloudy
with
sprinkles
of
rain
and
decided
to
wait
still
longer
to
see
if
beaman
could
get
a
good
photograph
and
we
had
another
night
of
insect
opera
the
next
day
by
noon
the
photographer
had
caught
the
scene
and
we
continued
our
descending
way
the
river
was
perfectly
smooth
except
a
small
rapid
late
in
the
day
with
walls
on
both
sides
steadily
increasing
their
altitude
desolation
in
its
beginning
is
exactly
the
reverse
of
lodore
and
split
mountain
in
the
latter
the
entrance
could
hardly
be
more
sudden
whereas
the
canyon
of
desolation
pushes
its
rock
walls
around
one
so
diplomatically
that
it
is
some
little
time
before
the
traveller
realises
that
he
is
caught
the
walls
were
ragged
barren
and
dreary
yet
majestic
we
missed
the
numerous
trees
which
in
the
upper
canyons
had
been
so
ornamental
wherever
they
could
find
a
footing
on
the
rocks
here
there
were
only
low
shrubs
as
a
rule
and
these
mainly
along
the
immediate
edge
of
the
water
though
high
up
on
north
slopes
pines
began
to
appear
altitude
latitude
and
aridity
combine
to
modify
vegetation
so
that
in
an
arid
region
one
notices
extraordinary
changes
often
in
a
single
locality
the
walls
still
had
the
tendency
to
break
into
turrets
and
towers
and
opposite
our
next
camp
a
pinnacle
stood
detached
from
the
wall
on
a
shelf
high
above
the
water
suggesting
a
beacon
and
it
was
named
lighthouse
rock
with
steward
and
cap
in
the
morning
august
climbed
out
to
study
the
contiguous
region
which
was
found
to
be
not
a
mountain
range
but
a
bleak
and
desolate
plateau
through
which
we
were
cutting
along
green
river
toward
a
still
higher
portion
this
was
afterwards
named
the
tavaputs
plateau
east
and
west
divisions
the
river
being
the
line
of
separation
the
walls
now
began
to
take
on
a
vertical
character
rising
above
the
water
to
feet
and
at
that
height
they
were
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
from
their
edges
they
broke
back
irregularly
to
a
separation
as
nearly
as
could
be
determined
of
from
three
to
five
miles

extreme

waiting
for

beaman
made
some

and
then
two
boats
dropped
down
a
quarter
of
a
mile
where
he
made
some
more
and
andy
got
dinner
i
remained
with
the
and
about
eleven
the
climbers
came
we
went
down
on
the
boat
to
the
noon
camp
and
as
soon
as
we
had
refreshed
the
inner
man
we
proceeded
thinking
it
about
time
for
rapids
to
appear
we
had
not
gone
far
before
we
distinguished
a
familiar
roar
just
preceding
the
turn
of
a
bend
which
disclosed
three
lying
within
half
a
mile
they
were
not
bad
but
the
river
was
wide
and
shallow
making
the
descent
more
difficult
than
it
would
ordinarily
have
been
the
river
was
now
approaching
its
lowest
stage
and
we
saw
an
uncomfortable
looking
lot
of
rocks
high
water
makes
easy
going
but
increases
the
risk
of
disaster
low
water
makes
hard
work
batters
the
boats
and
delays
progress
but
as
a
rule
it
is
less
risky
all
the
boats
cleared
the
first
rapid
without
any
difficulty
but
in
the
second
the
struck
a
sunken
rock
though
lightly
while
our
boat
landed
squarely
on
the
top
of
a
large
boulder
partially
submerged
where
we
hung
fast
with
the
water
boiling
furiously
around
and
almost
coming
over
the
sides
i
tried
to
get
out
over
the
port
bow
but
the
current
drew
me
under
the
boat
and
i
had
to
get
back
jack
concluded
we
were
only
fast
by
the
extreme
end
of
the
keel
and
jones
coming
forward
jack
slid
cautiously
out
over
the
stern
and
felt
around
with
his
feet
till
he
touched
the
rock
and
put
his
weight
on
it
thus
relieved
the
boat
lifted
slightly
and
shot
away
like
an
arrow
but
not
before
jack
leaped
on
again
as
soon
as
we
could
we
made
land
and
watched
the
which
fared
still
worse
she
struck
so
hard
that
two
of
the
after
ribs
and
some
planks
were
stove
in
they
then
extricated
her
and
pulling
her
up
on
the
rocky
shore
we
went
to
work
to
repair
with
cleats
made
from
a
broken
oar
this
delayed
us
an
hour
and
a
half
then
saws
and
hammers
were
stowed
away
and
the
third
rapid
was
run
without
a
mishap
it
was
only
the
low
stage
of
water
that
caused
the
trouble
a
little
farther
on
a
fourth
rapid
was
vanquished
and
we
went
into
camp
on
the
left
bank
in
a
cottonwood
grove
at
the
head
of
another
if
the
rocks
they
do
sthop
us
sang
jack
we
will
cross
to
killiloo
and
there
were
plenty
of
rocks
in
the
midst
of
foaming
waters
but
one
great
advantage
of
low
water
is
the
decreased
velocity
and
velocity
on
a
river
like
this
with
so
heavy
and
constant
a
fall
is
one
of
the
chief
factors
to
reckon
with
in
navigation
the
high
cliffs
two
thousand
feet
red
and
towering
in
the
bright
sun
became
sombre
and
mysterious
as
the
night
shadows
crept
over
them
the
summits
remaining
bright
from
the
last
western
rays
when
the
river
level
was
dim
and
uncertain
there
was
plenty
of
driftwood
and
our
fires
were
always
cheery
and
comfortable
the
nights
were
now
quite
cold
or
at
least
chilly
while
the
days
were
hot
as
soon
as
the
sun
came
over
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
through
some
of
the
narrow
promontories
at
this
particular
camp
there
were
peculiar
perforations
suggesting
immense
windows
looking
into
some
fairer
land
i
would
have
been
glad
to
examine
some
of
these
closely
but
as
it
was
not
necessary
they
were
passed
by
it
would
also
have
been
difficult
to
reach
them
as
they
were
very
high
up
the
rapid
at
our
camp
was
a
starter
the
next
day
on
a
line
of
them
following
one
after
the
other
till
we
had
run
without
accident
nine
before
halting
for
dinner
and
nine
in
miles
was
not
a
bad
record
we
landed
for
noon
on
the
same
spot
where
the
first
party
had
stopped
and
our
last
night
camp
was
also
coincident
with
theirs
according
to
their
map
which
we
had
for
consultation
decided
to
remain
here
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
also
the
next
one
which
was
sunday
up
in
a
high
gulch
some
pine
trees
were
visible
and
jack
and
i
climbed
up
to
them
and
collected
several
pounds
of
gum
for
repairing
the
boats
sunday
morning
jones
and
steward
struck
for
the
summit
up
the
cliffs
to
get
observations
an
hour
and
a
half
of
steady
hard
work
put
them
feet
above
the
river
but
they
were
still
three
hundred
feet
below
the
general
level
of
the
great
plateau
which
we
were
bisecting
thought
he
would
like
to
make
better
time
down
the
river
which
we
could
easily
have
done
up
to
this
point
but
if
we
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
canyon
too
soon
we
would
have
to
wait
there
and
it
was
better
to
distribute
the
wait
as
we
went
along
it
was
now
august
and
we
were
not
due
below
till
september
on
monday
morning
we
pushed
and
pulled
and
lifted
the
boats
through
a
shallow
rapid
half
a
mile
long
it
was
hard
work
then
came
one
which
we
ran
but
the
following
drop
was
deemed
too
risky
to
trust
our
boats
in
and
they
were
lowered
by
lines
then
in
a
short
distance
this
same
process
was
repeated
with
hard
work
in
a
very
bad
place
and
when
we
had
finished
that
we
were
tired
hungry
wet
and
cold
so
under
a
cottonwood
tree
on
the
right
we
stopped
for
needed
refreshment
and
while
it
was
preparing
most
of
us
hung
our
clothes
on
the
branches
of
a
fallen
tree
to
dry
the
rapid
foaming
and
fuming
presented
so
vigorous
an
appearance
and
made
so
much
noise
we
thought
it
ought
to
be
named
and
it
was
called
fretwater
falls
at
three
we
took
up
our
oars
again
and
were
whirled
along
at
runaway
speed
through
a
continuous
descent
for
half
a
mile
after
another
a
small
rapid
appeared
which
we
dashed
through
without
a
second
thought
and
then
came
our
final
effort
of
the
day
a
over
a
particularly
bad
spot
it
was
a
difficult
job
requiring
great
exertion
in
lifting
and
pushing
and
fending
off
so
when
gave
the
word
to
camp
on
the
left
we
were
all
glad
enough
to
do
so
we
had
made
only
miles
and
seven
rapids
the
had
been
hard
ones
with
a
couple
of
men
on
board
to
fend
off
and
two
or
three
on
the
hawser
holding
back
the
next
morning
august
we
made
another
around
a
bad
piece
of
river
and
ran
two
or
three
small
rapids
before
dinner
at
the
the
water
dropped
at
least
ten
feet
in
two
hundred
yards
and
estimated
thirty
in
half
a
mile
the
river
was
also
narrow
not
more
than
sixty
or
seventy
feet
in
one
place
many
rocks
studded
the
rapids
and
great
caution
had
to
be
exercised
both
in
and
in
runs
lest
the
boats
should
be
seriously
injured
with
two
or
three
more
feet
of
water
we
could
have
run
some
that
were
now
impossible
fortunately
there
was
always
plenty
of
room
on
both
banks
the
cliffs
being
well
back
from
the
water
a
series
of
small
rapids
gave
us
no
special
trouble
and
having
put
them
behind
we
ran
in
at
the
head
of
a
one
had
dinner
and
then
made
a
starting
on
we
soon
came
to
a
very
sharp
rapid
which
we
ran
and
found
it
was
only
an
introduction
to
one
following
that
demanded
careful
treatment
another
was
the
necessary
course
and
when
it
was
accomplished
we
stopped
for
the
night
where
we
were
on
the
sand
every
man
tired
wet
and
hungry
we
had
made
only
four
miles
a
significant
note
of
warning
was
found
here
in
the
shape
of
fragments
of
the
unfortunate
mixed
up
with
the
driftwood
fully
two
hundred
miles
below
the
falls
where
the
wreck
occurred
the
precipices
surrounding
us
had
now
reached
truly
magnificent
proportions
one
section
near
our
camp
springing
almost
vertically
to
a
height
of
or
feet
on
the
dizzy
summit
we
could
discern
what
had
the
appearance
of
an
and
from
this
we
called
it
cliff
the
cabin
was
in
reality
a
butte
of
shale
as
we
could
see
by
means
of
our
glasses
and
of
course
of
far
greater
size
than
a
real
cabin
but
from
below
the
illusion
was
complete
at
this
camp
no
we
remained
the
next
day
wishing
to
make
some
investigations
he
and
jones
crossed
to
the
other
side
and
went
down
on
foot
two
or
three
miles
then
returning
he
went
up
some
distance
while
the
rest
of
us
mended
our
clothes
worked
up
notes
and
did
a
score
of
little
duties
that
had
been
neglected
in
the
river
work
jack
and
i
climbed
up
the
cliffs
and
got
more
pine
gum
with
which
we
caulked
up
the
seams
in
our
boat
cap
kindly
turned
barber
and
redeemed
me
from
the
danger
of
being
classed
as
the
air
was
too
hazy
for
photographing
or
for
getting
observations
from
the
summit
and
concluded
to
stay
till
next
day
at
this
place
and
then
go
to
the
top
of
the
world
in
other
words
to
the
summit
very
early
in
the
morning
august
steward
and
cap
started
with
for
the
climb
keeping
up
the
main
canyon
for
a
mile
they
came
to
a
side
gorge
where
had
been
the
day
before
which
they
followed
for
half
a
mile
and
then
boldly
mounted
the
cliffs
reaching
an
altitude
of
feet
above
the
river
while
they
were
gone
jack
and
i
climbed
after
more
pine
gum
and
succeeded
in
getting
five
or
six
pounds
for
future
use
as
i
was
descending
along
a
terrace
jack
being
some
distance
behind
and
above
a
fine
large
mountain
sheep
sleek
and
clean
with
beautiful
strong
horns
sprang
along
four
or
five
hundred
feet
from
me
and
stopped
in
full
view
listening
to
jack
footsteps
i
had
no
gun
and
could
only
admire
him
till
he
bounded
lightly
away
about
one
the
climbing
party
came
back
steward
had
shot
a
mountain
sheep
with
a
revolver
only
to
find
that
a
deep
canyon
intervened
between
him
and
his
prize
and
there
was
no
way
of
getting
it
about
half
past
two
we
shoved
out
into
the
river
again
running
a
small
rapid
immediately
the
water
was
so
shallow
that
our
keel
struck
a
number
of
times
but
no
damage
was
done
we
had
hardly
cleared
this
when
we
arrived
at
a
drop
of
about
six
feet
in
a
few
yards
with
the
whole
river
filled
with
bad
rocks
at
this
place
according
to
the
map
made
by
the
first
party
their
was
capsised
we
made
a
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
on
repeated
the
operation
should
be
following
this
were
some
swift
shoals
which
brought
us
to
another
ugly
descent
where
the
stove
a
hole
in
her
side
and
came
near
upsetting
was
knocked
half
out
of
the
boat
but
got
in
again
the
other
boats
we
lowered
by
lines
and
they
passed
through
uninjured
near
this
point
a
fine
clear
little
stream
about
a
rod
wide
entered
from
the
west
after
running
two
more
rapids
decided
to
camp
which
we
did
on
the
right
camp
our
run
footed
up
miles
our
camp
was
in
some
cottonwoods
and
we
had
to
cross
a
wide
rocky
bar
to
get
to
it
but
it
was
preferable
to
camping
on
the
sand
in
this
canyon
there
was
generally
a
valley
about
mile
wide
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
with
the
abundant
supply
of
driftwood
for
fires
and
a
whole
river
for
drink
we
fared
well
the
great
canyon
now
appeared
deeper
than
at
any
point
above
about
three
thousand
feet
we
estimated
the
walls
being
extremely
precipitous
one
cliff
not
far
from
camp
appeared
to
be
nearly
perpendicular
steward
got
up
very
early
the
next
morning
in
order
to
mend
his
shoes
and
he
succeeded
so
well
as
cobbler
we
declared
he
had
missed
his
calling
but
we
did
not
start
till
ten
waiting
for
beaman
to
take
views
the
first
thing
we
then
did
was
to
run
a
very
shallow
rapid
followed
by
another
long
difficult
narrow
and
rocky
then
there
was
a
short
easy
one
with
the
next
below
compelling
a
very
hard
there
was
nothing
but
rocks
large
rocks
so
close
together
that
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
manoeuvre
the
boats
between
them
there
was
no
channel
anywhere
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
we
had
to
pull
them
empty
over
the
rocks
on
driftwood
skids
which
taxed
our
muscles
considerably
and
of
course
saturated
our
clothing
for
half
the
time
we
were
in
the
water
as
was
always
the
case
at
this
over
we
had
our
noon
ration
of
bread
bacon
and
coffee
and
took
a
fresh
start
by
running
a
nice
clear
rapid
and
then
another
a
below
and
we
thought
we
were
getting
on
well
when
we
saw
ahead
a
fall
of
some
ten
feet
in
fourteen
rods
turbulent
and
fierce
the
only
prudent
thing
for
this
rapid
was
a
and
we
went
at
it
at
once
it
was
the
usual
pulling
hauling
fending
and
pushing
but
we
got
through
with
it
after
a
while
and
naming
it
at
the
suggestion
of
some
one
melvin
falls
we
went
on
to
the
eighth
and
last
rapid
for
the
day
this
was
half
a
mile
long
and
very
rocky
but
it
was
thought
we
could
run
it
and
all
went
through
safely
except
the
which
caught
her
keel
on
a
rock
and
hung
for
a
moment
then
cleared
and
finished
with
no
damage
we
made
camp
on
a
these
hills
were
a
feature
of
the
wide
banks
being
blown
up
by
the
winds
sometimes
to
a
height
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
our
run
for
the
day
was
less
than
five
miles
yet
as
we
had
passed
eight
rapids
one
way
and
another
we
were
all
pretty
tired
and
of
course
wet
and
hungry
a
good
big
was
quickly
started
our
dry
garments
from
the
rubber
bags
donned
in
place
of
the
flapping
wet
ones
and
we
were
entirely
comfortable
with
the
bread
baking
in
the
dutch
oven
the
coffee
or
tea
steaming
away
and
the
inspiring
fragrance
of
frying
bacon
wafted
on
the
evening
air
when
we
stopped
long
enough
andy
would
give
us
boiled
beans
or
stewed
dried
apples
as
a
treat
if
we
desired
to
enliven
the
conversation
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
start
the
subject
of
the
light
back
at
the
camp
where
we
first
met
douglas
boy
every
one
would
soon
be
involved
except
who
only
laughed
and
inserted
from
time
to
time
a
remark
to
keep
up
the
interest
jack
would
always
give
us
a
songs
and
to
this
steward
would
add
a
solo
on
the
the
evenings
were
growing
longer
and
we
sat
closer
to
the
fire
sometimes
cap
and
clem
would
play
a
game
of
euchre
but
no
one
else
seemed
to
care
anything
about
cards
our
beds
when
possible
were
made
by
first
putting
down
willows
or
cedar
twigs
in
regular
order
on
which
the
blankets
would
be
spread
making
a
luxurious
bed
on
which
sleep
instantly
overtook
us
with
the
sound
of
falling
water
generally
the
last
thing
and
the
first
in
our
ears
at
the
next
morning
august
we
were
speeding
on
our
way
and
ran
the
rapid
which
had
sent
its
lullaby
to
our
camp
another
came
right
after
it
shallow
and
bad
and
then
one
more
where
the
channel
was
beset
with
innumerable
boulders
hidden
under
the
surface
happily
the
boats
were
not
seriously
damaged
they
needed
no
repairs
and
we
kept
on
to
the
next
barrier
which
proved
to
be
not
runable
with
any
prospect
of
getting
through
whole
so
we
made
a
portage
then
there
was
a
rapid
we
ran
easily
but
as
if
to
revenge
itself
for
making
one
gentle
for
us
the
river
obliged
us
to
work
a
laborious
passage
at
the
next
two
we
had
good
hard
work
lowering
by
lines
wading
alongside
where
necessary
to
ease
the
boats
or
clinging
to
their
sides
where
the
water
was
deep
while
the
men
on
shore
at
the
hawser
end
lowered
away
to
a
shallow
place
we
were
glad
to
halt
at
for
dinner
and
a
short
rest
there
was
a
heavy
rapid
beside
us
as
we
ate
and
steward
named
it
chandler
falls
it
had
a
descent
of
about
twelve
feet
in
twenty
rods
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
a
clear
little
creek
came
in
and
this
was
named
chandler
creek
chandler
being
the
maiden
name
of
wife
beaman
and
clem
selected
a
position
with
their
photographic
outfit
and
made
some
photographs
of
us
as
we
were
working
the
boats
through
a
mile
below
we
halted
on
the
right
for
beaman
to
get
more
views
none
of
his
photographs
of
the
rapids
came
out
well
as
the
plates
were
too
slow
up
a
gulch
on
the
right
we
could
see
a
remarkable
topographic
feature
nothing
less
than
a
gigantic
aperture
or
natural
arch
in
the
cliff
it
had
a
span
of
at
least
feet
with
a
height
of
about
half
as
much
it
was
or
feet
above
the
river
hundreds
of
cedar
trees
grew
around
the
arch
on
the
ledges
of
the
huge
wall
through
which
it
was
cut
by
the
action
of
the
elements
the
cliffs
everywhere
were
now
becoming
more
broken
and
there
was
an
entrance
somewhere
from
the
back
country
or
it
may
have
been
up
the
canyon
for
we
discovered
remains
of
tipis
and
camps
with
metates
or
grinding
stones
the
first
evidences
of
human
beings
we
had
seen
since
the
moki
wall
this
and
the
breaking
of
the
cliffs
caused
us
to
believe
that
we
were
nearing
the
end
of
the
canyon
with
jones
and
steward
went
on
foot
for
a
distance
to
see
what
was
coming
next
and
found
a
stretch
of
very
bad
water
on
the
return
a
rattlesnake
struck
at
steward
but
luckily
failed
to
hit
him
steward
killed
it
we
concluded
to
stop
for
the
night
where
we
were
with
the
record
four
rapids
run
three
and
miles
in
distance
this
camp
was
not
satisfactory
and
we
got
out
of
it
early
the
next
morning
while
beaman
was
making
some
views
across
the
river
we
lowered
the
other
two
boats
through
one
rapid
and
then
ran
them
through
a
second
in
of
a
mile
to
a
better
camping
place
from
which
we
went
back
and
helped
the
third
boat
the
do
the
same
wanted
to
climb
out
but
the
morning
being
half
gone
he
planned
to
start
after
dinner
and
meanwhile
he
read
emerson
aloud
to
us
till
andy
shouted
his
go
fur
it
boys
accompanied
by
steward
and
clem
in
the
afternoon
he
climbed
up
or
feet
to
a
point
where
he
could
see
down
the
river
two
or
three
miles
they
counted
seven
rapids
and
confirmed
the
belief
that
the
walls
were
breaking
the
surrounding
country
was
made
up
of
huge
ridges
that
ran
in
toward
the
river
from
five
miles
back
our
camp
was
in
a
little
valley
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
the
bottom
covered
with
cedars
and
greasewood
the
scenery
was
still
on
a
magnificent
scale
but
barren
and
desolate
the
next
morning
august
we
were
under
way
at
and
plunged
almost
immediately
into
the
rapids
which
had
been
sighted
from
the
cliffs
above
in
a
little
over
four
miles
we
let
down
six
times
a
seventh
rapid
we
ran
and
then
stopped
for
noon
on
the
left
every
man
as
usual
soaking
wet
a
little
rain
fell
but
not
enough
to
consider
after
dinner
four
more
rapids
were
put
behind
we
ran
all
but
one
at
which
we
made
a
our
record
for
this
day
was
eleven
rapids
in
a
trifle
less
than
seven
miles
and
we
were
camped
at
the
head
of
another
rapid
which
was
to
form
our
in
the
morning
the
walls
receded
from
the
river
of
a
mile
and
now
though
still
very
high
had
more
the
appearance
of
isolated
cliffs
we
had
not
a
single
unpleasant
incident
till
beaman
on
this
day
ran
one
rapid
contrary
to
orders
he
was
sharply
reprimanded
and
for
the
time
being
his
tendency
to
insubordination
and
recklessness
was
checked
he
probably
did
not
mean
to
be
either
but
his
confidence
in
his
ability
to
steer
through
anything
led
him
astray
in
the
evening
by
the
light
read
aloud
from
although
a
heavy
wind
blew
sand
all
over
us
no
one
seemed
to
complain
the
next
morning
august
the
first
thing
we
did
was
to
run
the
rapid
beside
our
camp
a
beautiful
chute
swift
long
and
free
from
rocks
immediately
below
this
was
one
half
a
mile
long
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
the
river
making
a
sharp
bend
with
a
bad
current
but
we
ran
it
this
was
in
fact
a
part
of
the
other
rapid
or
it
might
be
so
classed
as
was
frequently
the
case
where
the
descent
was
nearly
continuous
from
one
rapid
to
another
the
river
was
very
narrow
at
this
place
not
more
than
feet
wide
we
had
not
gone
far
before
we
reached
a
rapid
where
it
was
prudent
to
lower
the
boats
and
not
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
below
this
there
was
another
of
a
similar
character
but
necessitating
harder
work
then
we
were
brought
face
to
face
with
one
more
that
could
not
be
run
with
safety
on
the
present
stage
of
water
though
we
ran
a
part
of
it
and
made
a
past
the
remainder
when
this
was
finally
accomplished
with
everything
in
good
order
we
found
ourselves
in
front
of
still
another
that
refused
to
grant
us
clear
passage
and
we
worked
the
boats
down
with
lines
as
in
the
previous
rapids
without
removing
the
cargoes
the
method
was
the
usual
one
for
the
three
or
four
men
on
the
line
and
a
couple
on
board
the
boat
to
manoeuvre
and
protect
her
having
by
this
time
advanced
three
and
miles
from
last
night
camp
we
stopped
for
dinner
on
taking
up
the
oars
again
the
first
rapid
was
a
fine
clear
descent
with
extremely
large
waves
through
which
all
three
boats
dashed
with
exhilarating
speed
leaping
part
of
their
length
out
of
the
water
as
their
velocity
carried
them
zipping
over
the
crests
our
boat
happened
to
strike
near
the
finish
on
a
submerged
rock
to
the
right
of
the
main
channel
and
near
shore
and
there
she
hung
for
some
moments
the
first
boat
had
landed
below
and
some
of
the
men
quickly
came
up
to
where
i
could
throw
them
our
line
and
this
pulled
us
off
without
any
damage
worth
mentioning
a
little
below
this
we
ran
another
successfully
and
had
not
gone
far
before
we
were
astonished
at
the
sight
of
a
horse
grazing
unconcernedly
on
some
low
bluffs
on
the
right
had
discovered
this
horse
with
his
field
glass
while
we
stopped
above
to
examine
one
of
the
rapids
he
thought
it
might
indicate
the
presence
of
the
major
or
of
indians
but
he
did
not
mention
the
matter
to
any
of
us
when
we
were
at
a
good
point
and
just
as
all
hands
had
discovered
the
animal
he
ordered
a
sharp
landing
on
the
same
side
we
ran
in
quickly
went
up
the
bank
and
gave
several
shouts
while
we
held
ourselves
ready
for
action
there
was
no
response
he
then
went
to
the
horse
and
found
it
very
lame
which
coupled
with
the
absence
of
any
indication
of
visitors
within
recent
months
caused
us
to
conclude
that
the
horse
had
been
abandoned
by
indians
who
had
been
encamped
here
a
good
while
before
we
left
the
place
and
running
another
rapid
a
little
one
we
came
to
a
fine
spot
for
a
camp
on
the
right
at
the
beginning
of
a
heavy
rapid
and
there
we
stayed
for
the
night
there
was
now
a
marked
change
in
the
geology
and
fossiliferous
beds
which
for
a
long
time
had
been
absent
appeared
the
canyon
walls
also
broke
away
considerably
the
next
morning
it
was
decided
that
we
should
remain
at
this
camp
till
after
dinner
for
observation
work
i
went
out
with
steward
to
help
him
gather
fossils
and
beaman
took
some
views
while
the
others
occupied
themselves
with
various
duties
the
afternoon
began
by
letting
the
boats
by
line
past
the
rapid
at
camp
which
beaman
called
sharp
mountain
falls
from
a
pointed
peak
overhead
there
was
a
drop
of
about
fifteen
feet
in
thirty
rods
beaman
wanted
to
photograph
us
in
the
midst
of
our
work
and
got
ready
for
it
but
a
came
on
and
we
had
to
wait
till
it
cleared
for
him
to
get
the
picture
we
then
went
ahead
dashing
through
a
pretty
rapid
with
a
swift
current
and
next
had
a
long
stretch
of
rapid
though
not
difficult
river
making
in
all
miles
and
camping
at
five
on
the
left
the
only
trouble
we
had
was
that
in
choosing
one
of
four
channels
our
boat
got
where
she
was
inevitably
drawn
into
the
top
of
a
sunken
dead
tree
lodged
in
the
rocks
and
my
starboard
row
lock
was
broken
off
on
shore
steward
killed
another
rattlesnake
of
which
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
many
along
the
river
we
were
now
actually
out
of
the
canyon
of
desolation
and
in
the
beginning
of
what
the
major
at
first
called
coal
canyon
then
lignite
and
finally
gray
the
name
it
bears
because
of
the
colour
of
the
walls
the
division
between
the
two
canyons
was
the
break
down
where
we
had
seen
the
horse
casting
up
we
found
that
the
canyon
of
desolation
is
miles
long
early
the
next
morning
august
we
pulled
away
from
camp
soon
running
two
small
rapids
of
no
consequence
and
in
three
miles
came
to
a
descent
of
some
ten
feet
in
a
very
short
space
where
we
made
a
three
fair
rapids
were
next
run
easily
when
we
halted
to
examine
a
place
where
we
let
down
again
an
encounter
with
three
more
two
of
them
each
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
took
us
till
noon
though
we
ran
them
and
we
came
to
a
stop
for
dinner
now
the
walls
had
narrowed
the
canyon
being
about
half
a
mile
wide
at
the
top
sometimes
not
more
than
a
quarter
the
colour
was
buff
and
there
were
seams
of
coal
and
lignite
in
places
on
one
or
the
other
side
the
cliffs
were
nearly
vertical
for
about
three
hundred
feet
then
breaking
back
to
jagged
heights
reaching
about
two
thousand
feet
after
dinner
having
run
two
more
rapids
without
trouble
we
arrived
at
a
very
difficult
locality
where
the
first
cliffs
six
hundred
feet
high
came
down
vertically
on
both
sides
quite
close
to
the
water
we
saw
how
we
could
navigate
it
but
at
flood
time
it
would
be
a
most
serious
proposition
as
there
would
be
no
footing
on
either
side
unless
perhaps
on
the
huge
masses
of
fallen
rock
at
the
present
stage
we
were
able
to
let
the
boats
down
by
lines
then
we
had
two
easy
rapids
followed
by
another
not
more
difficult
but
less
safe
a
little
farther
on
we
ran
two
more
which
completed
the
record
for
the
day
and
we
were
glad
to
camp
with
a
total
run
of
miles
and
many
rapids
with
three
a
feature
of
the
cliffs
this
day
was
numerous
alcoves
and
grottoes
worn
into
the
sandstone
some
of
them
like
great
caverns
with
extremely
narrow
canyons
leading
into
them
in
the
morning
with
jones
and
steward
climbed
out
the
country
was
elevated
above
the
river
about
two
thousand
feet
a
wild
labyrinth
of
ragged
gulches
gullies
and
sharp
peaks
devoid
of
vegetation
except
a
few
piñons
on
some
slopes
the
whole
presenting
a
picture
of
complete
desolation
at
a
quarter
past
twelve
we
were
again
gliding
down
on
a
stiff
current
we
ran
seven
easy
rapids
and
by
lines
twice
before
arriving
about
three
at
the
mouth
of
a
sixty
feet
wide
which
said
was
little
white
or
price
river
the
mouth
was
so
devoid
of
water
that
we
camped
on
the
smooth
sand
it
being
the
only
ground
free
from
brush
a
sudden
rise
or
would
have
made
it
an
active
place
for
us
but
we
decided
to
take
the
risk
for
one
night
and
jones
tried
to
get
out
by
following
up
this
river
bed
but
they
were
not
successful
game
was
abundant
and
they
thought
there
might
be
an
indian
trail
but
they
saw
none
in
the
evening
steward
gave
us
a
recital
and
jack
sang
a
lot
of
his
songs
in
fine
style
the
air
was
soft
and
tranquil
and
knowing
we
had
now
conquered
the
canyon
of
desolation
without
a
serious
mishap
we
all
felt
well
satisfied
in
the
morning
august
breakfast
was
disposed
of
early
the
boats
were
put
in
trim
and
away
we
went
again
on
a
good
current
running
many
rapids
and
making
one
in
a
distance
of
eight
miles
i
counted
fourteen
rapids
steward
ten
or
eleven
only
eight
showing
that
it
is
not
always
easy
to
separate
the
rapids
where
they
come
so
close
together
in
one
the
river
was
no
more
than
thirty
feet
wide
with
big
waves
that
made
the
boats
jump
and
ship
water
we
reached
a
bend
and
saw
the
end
of
the
canyon
only
a
mile
or
two
away
but
we
had
to
make
the
mentioned
before
we
got
there
our
camp
number
was
made
about
noon
just
inside
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
on
the
left
opposite
a
high
beautiful
pinnacle
we
called
cathedral
butte
afterwards
changing
the
name
to
gunnison
here
we
would
wait
till
the
time
appointed
for
the
major
to
join
us
according
to
the
plan
gray
canyon
was
now
also
behind
us
with
its
miles
and
numerous
rapids
adding
to
it
the
miles
of
desolation
made
the
total
canyon
from
wonsits

about
feet

through
a
hundred
rapids
some
small
some
heavy
the
entire
fall
from
our
starting
point
was
now
some
two
thousand
feet
and
jones
went
down
the
valley
two
miles
with
the
hope
of
seeing
signs
of
the
major
but
not
a
human
being
was
to
be
found
anywhere

being

we
lounged
around
in

of
relaxation

we
did
not

to
roll
up

stow
them

came
upon

all
were

the

space
from
the
san
rafael
to
the
mouth
of
the

is
the
unknown
country
referred
to
in
this
volume
which
was
investigated
in
preliminary
maps
b
c
and
d
at
pages
and
respectively
partly
give
the
results
of
the
work
which
filled
in
this
area
through
this
valley
passed
the
famous
trail
from
santa
fé
to
los
angeles
laid
out
in
by
that
splendid
pioneer
william
wolfskill
the
reason
he
came
so
far
north
was
because
there
was
no
place
to
cross
the
canyons
below
that
was
known
this
path
was
occasionally
travelled
for
years
and
became
celebrated
as
the
old
spanish
trail
here
it
was
that
captain
gunnison
of
our
army
in
his
notable
explorations
crossed
in
on
his
westward
journey
which
a
few
days
later
proved
fatal
to
him
as
he
was
killed
by
the
before
leaving
he
established
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
this
crossing
which
ever
after
bore
his
name
together
with
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
the
mouth
of
henry
fork
and
the
mouth
of
diamond
creek
this
made
four
points
astronomically
fixed
before
the
major
came
between
the
union
pacific
crossing
and
the
end
of
the
grand
canyon
diamond
creek
mouth
was
determined
accurately
by
ives
in
the
trappers
and
fur
hunters
between
and
men
like
jim
bridger
and
kit
carson
had
roamed
more
or
less
over
the
region
we
had
come
through
and
occasionally
they
had
tried
to
see
the
river
in
the
canyons
the
aridity
of
the
country
generally
held
them
back
ashley
as
already
noted
had
made
the
passage
of
red
canyon
and
the
trapper
meek
with
several
companions
had
gone
through
lodore
and
whirlpool
one
winter
on
the
ice
frémont
simpson
berthoud
selden
and
some
other
scientific
explorers
had
passed
here
and
there
reconnoitring
and
macomb
in
had
made
a
reconnaissance
to
the
south
and
of
gunnison
crossing
so
that
a
general
idea
of
the
character
of
the
region
had
been
obtained
and
a
kind
of
approximate
topography
had
been
tentatively
thrown
in
yet
it
was
mainly
an
unknown
wilderness
so
far
as
record
went
particularly
contiguous
to
the
river
but
south
from
the
san
rafael
to
the
paria
and
west
to
the
high
plateaus
forming
the
southward
continuation
of
the
wasatch
range
an
area
of
at
least
square
miles
there
was
still
a
completely
unknown
country
indeed
even
from
the
paria
on
down
to
the
grand
wash
the
region
on
the
right
was
hardly
better
understood
though
there
were
several
mormon
settlements
on
the
headwaters
of
the
virgin
and
recently
the
settlement
of
kanab
had
been
made
farther
east
on
the
south
of
the
grand
canyon
ives
had
reconnoitred
to
some
extent
reaching
the
river
at
the
mouth
of
diamond
creek
but
at
no
other
point
above
that
did
he
come
to
the
river
nor
get
anywhere
near
its
canyon
above
the
tributary
habasu
cataract
in
the
entire
stretch
from
gunnison
crossing
to
the
end
of
the
grand
canyon
a
distance
of
miles
but
two
points
were
known
where
the
river
could
be
crossed
the
crossing
of
the
fathers
el
vado
de
los
padres
about
latitude
and
the
mouth
of
the
paria
only
miles
lower
down
this
latter
place
had
been
discovered
by
jacob
hamblin
or
old
jacob
as
he
was
familiarly
called
and
he
was
the
first
white
man
to
cross
there
which
he
did
in
october
he
was
a
mormon
scout
and
pioneer
of
those
days
he
forded
at
el
vado
his
first
time
in
possibly
the
first
white
man
after
escalante
though
the
ford
was
known
to
at
least
richard
campbell
the
trapper
in
or
earlier
in
jacob
circumtoured
the
grand
and
marble
canyons
going
from
george
by
way
of
the
grand
wash
to
the
moki
towns
and
returning
by
way
of
el
vado
thus
the
region
below
us
to
the
left
or
east
had
been
reconnoitred
in
a
general
way
by
macomb
while
that
to
the
right
or
west
had
not
had
even
exploration
until
the
major
unrivalled
first
descent
in
the
river
was
equally
unknown
even
above
gunnison
crossing
despite
the
spasmodic
efforts
at
exploration
referred
to
the
river
had
remained
a
geographical
enigma
and
to
the
major
belongs
the
sole
credit
for
solving
this
great
problem
throughout
its
length
from
the
union
pacific
crossing
in
wyoming
to
the
mouth
of
the
virgin
river
the
last
problem
of
this
kind
within
the
united
states
hampered
as
the
first
party
was
by
loss
of
provisions
and
instruments
they
nevertheless
made
a
plat
of
the
immediate
course
of
the
stream
portions
of
which
were
lost
with
the
men
who
were
killed
by
the
shewits
on
leaving
the
party
near
the
end
of
the
grand
canyon
so
far
we
had
not
been
bothered
in
the
least
by
lack
of
provisions
instruments
time
health
or
strength
and
we
had
been
able
to
make
an
accurate
meander
of
the
river
note
the
topography
and
geology
as
we
went
along
climb
out
frequently
to
examine
the
surrounding
country
and
in
every
way
carry
forward
the
scientific
work
as
planned
it
was
now
a
question
whether
or
not
we
would
get
our
supplies
at
the
next
appointed
station
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
river
or
whether
we
would
be
obliged
to
weigh
out
what
we
had
and
by
limiting
ourselves
to
strict
rations
put
the
work
through
anyhow
by
september
we
would
probably
have
information
on
this
point
that
being
the
limit
set
for
our
waiting
should
the
major
not
arrive
by
that
time
it
would
mean
that
we
were
to
go
on
as
best
we
could
with
the
supplies
on
hand
monday
was
devoted
to
overhauling
the
boats
while
took
observations
during
a
rest
he
also
read
aloud
to
us
from
tennyson
a
land
of
streams
some
like
a
downward
smoke
slow
dropping
veils
of
thinnest
lawn
did
go
and
some
thro
wavering
lights
and
shadows
broke
rolling
a
slumbrous
sheet
of
foam
below
they
saw
the
gleaming
river
seaward
flow
from
the
inner
land
far
off
three
three
silent
pinnacles
of
aged
snow
stood
and
dew
with
showery
drops
the
shadowy
pine
above
the
copse
he
was
an
excellent
reader
and
we
enjoyed
his
various
selections
they
gave
variety
and
new
drift
to
our
thought
which
was
refreshing
and
beneficial
when
the
boats
were
completed
they
were
returned
to
the
river
but
for
the
time
being
the
rations
and
other
things
forming
their
cargoes
were
permitted
to
remain
on
shore
covered
by
the
paulins
the
boats
swung
gracefully
at
their
lines
and
jack
was
tempted
to
get
out
his
fishing
tackle
in
the
early
evening
and
seat
himself
on
one
of
the
cabins
to
wait
patiently
for
a
bite
softly
the
river
rippled
by
with
an
innocent
murmur
as
if
it
had
never
been
guilty
of
anything
but
the
calmest
and
motion
such
as
now
reflected
the
great
pinnacle
across
the
way
standing
feet
clear
cut
against
the
glowing
sky
the
air
was
balmy
no
wind
blew
and
a
universal
quiet
prevailed
when
suddenly
jack
uttered
several
exclamations
not
entirely
in
harmony
with
the
moment
he
thought
his
precious
hook
was
caught
on
a
snag
pulling
gently
in
order
not
to
break
his
line
the
snag
lifted
with
it
and
presently
he
was
astounded
to
see
not
the
branch
of
a
tree
or
a
stick
but
the
head
of
an
enormous
fish
appear
above
the
surface
had
there
been
some
splashing
he
would
have
been
prepared
for
the
extraordinary
sight
but
the
monster
came
with
barely
a
wriggle
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
to
be
caught
he
was
successfully
landed
in
the
middle
cabin
of
the
boat
which
was
empty
except
for
some
water
and
lay
there
unhurt
as
if
it
were
the
natural
place
for
him
casting
again
another
of
the
same
kind
came
forth
and
then
a
third
the
longest
appeared
to
be
the
length
of
the
cabin
as
he
floated
in
the
water
and
that
was
four
feet
he
was
at
least
thirty
or
inches
with
a
circumference
of
fifteen
inches
the
others
were
considerably
shorter
but
nevertheless
very
large
fish
the
big
one
was
killed
for
food
and
steward
noted
that
the
heart
after
removal
kept
up
pulsations
of
twenty
beats
to
the
minute
for
half
an
hour
these
fish
are
now
called
colorado
river
salmon
the
flesh
was
white
and
they
seemed
to
us
good
eating

stanton
on
tuesday
august
the
third
day
of
our
waiting
as
we
were
about
to
return
to
various
occupations
after
dinner
three
rapid
shots
broke
suddenly
on
the
quiet
air
from
down
the
valley
it
was
our
signal
the
major
cried
all
in
a
breath
and
a
reply
signal
was
instantly
fired
clem
and
i
were
sent
immediately
to
the
end
of
the
island
carrying
our
rifles
of
course
for
while
we
had
little
doubt
as
to
who
it
was
there
might
be
a
surprise
we
hurried
down
while
the
others
watched
the
bank
beyond
as
soon
as
we
cleared
the
bushes
and
could
see
the
western
shore
we
distinguished
the
major
and
a
stranger
by
his
side
with
horses
we
shouted
to
them
directions
for
reaching
our
camp
and
they
rode
up
till
they
came
opposite
to
it
whence
they
were
ferried
over
while
jones
took
the
horses
down
to
their
camp
about
four
miles
below
the
major
reported
an
absolute
failure
in
the
attempt
to
find
a
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
river
and
he
had
not
himself
been
able
to
do
anything
about
it
the
first
trial
was
eastward
from
glencove
a
mormon
settlement
on
the
sevier
it
failed
because
the
indian
guides
refused
to
proceed
beyond
fifty
miles
and
it
was
not
practicable
to
go
on
without
them
a
second
party
was
then
sent
in
a
little
later
under
old
jacob
from
kanab
they
reached
a
river
flowing
to
the
colorado
at
about
the
right
place
and
for
many
miles
followed
it
with
extreme
difficulty
and
hazard
even
at
the
low
stage
of
water
prevailing
down
through
a
deep
narrow
canyon
sometimes
they
were
compelled
to
swim
their
horses
where
the
rapid
stream
filled
the
chasm
from
wall
to
wall
and
continual
crossing
and
were
necessary
from
one
footing
to
another
this
perilous
effort
was
also
abandoned
the
major
had
gone
to
salt
lake
and
from
there
being
informed
of
these
results
down
to
a
village
called
manti
whence
he
made
his
way
across
country
to
our
present
position
with
several
pack
animals
bringing
three
hundred
pounds
of
flour
a
quantity
of
jerked
beef
and
twenty
pounds
of
sugar
this
was
not
exactly
adequate
to
the
circumstances
but
he
probably
thought
it
was
all
he
could
get
through
with
to
the
meeting
place
appointed
in
the
time
alloted
while
he
and
fred
hamblin
the
man
accompanying
him
were
eating
their
dinner
we
packed
the
boats
and
when
all
was
ready
took
them
on
board
the
major
in
his
old
place
in
the
armchair
on
our
boat
and
hamblin
on
the
middle
deck
of
another
in
the
run
down
to
the
camp
hamblin
was
very
uncomfortable
for
he
was
not
accustomed
to
boats
especially
to
boats
that
ran
so
fast
there
were
two
little
rapids
some
swift
chutes
and
in
several
places
the
river
shoaled
and
we
grated
slightly
on
the
gravel
stretching
away
westward
from
gunnison
butte
we
saw
an
exquisitely
modelled
line
of
cliffs
some
portions
being
a
clear
azure
blue
at
first
it
was
proposed
to
name
them
henry
cliffs
but
they
were
finally
called
from
their
colour
azure
presently
we
arrived
at
the
camp
where
we
found
another
man
lyman
hamblin
a
son
of
jacob
and
nephew
of
fred
they
were
both
mormons
from
kanab
near
the
arizona
line
in
southern
utah
they
had
a
large
amount
of
mail
for
us
and
every
one
fell
to
reading
letters
and
papers
august
and
were
spent
here
getting
our
work
in
shape
making
sketches
and
observations
as
well
as
writing
letters
and
helping
the
hamblins
prepare
for
their
trip
back
through
the
wild
country
they
had
met
with
no
indians
on
the
way
in
and
they
hoped
to
be
equally
fortunate
going
back
having
no
desire
to
see
any
in
this
as
they
told
me
afterwards
they
were
not
successful
they
mounted
their
horses
friday
september
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
the
west
was
taking
on
a
rich
evening
glow
and
turning
in
that
direction
vanished
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
a
into
the
mystery
of
colour
bearing
our
letters
the
geographic
data
the
geologic
notes
and
all
the
other
material
which
we
had
collected
since
leaving
the
mouth
of
the
uinta
and
which
it
was
thought
advisable
to
send
out
both
for
safety
and
to
relieve
our
crowded
cabins
they
said
that
the
next
evening
before
they
realised
it
they
found
themselves
so
near
a
large
encampment
of
indians
that
there
was
no
getting
away
and
they
did
the
only
thing
they
could
sensibly
do
rode
boldly
on
straight
into
the
midst
of
the
strangers
with
the
hope
that
the
band
belonged
where
they
were
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
in
which
case
they
were
surely
peaceful
both
men
spoke
ute
well
and
they
had
had
long
experience
the
indians
proved
to
be
entirely
friendly
and
the
hamblins
camped
with
them
for
the
night
not
because
they
wanted
to
but
because
they
thought
it
inexpedient
to
do
otherwise
when
they
left
us
we
felt
that
they
were
old
friends
for
they
were
fine
men
and
most
agreeable
besides
with
the
exception
of
basor
who
had
driven
the
team
down
from
salt
lake
to
the
uinta
with
our
rations
they
were
the
only
white
men
which
those
of
us
who
had
not
visited
the
uinta
agency
had
seen
since
the
harrells
in
brown
park
nearly
three
months
before
an
hour
after
their
departure
we
pushed
off
and
ran
down
about
half
a
mile
passing
one
little
rapid
to
the
old
crossing
where
we
stopped
on
the
left
for
the
night
beaman
and
i
were
commissioned
to
go
back
to
our
camp
gunnison
to
get
a
saw
which
had
been
forgotten
there
we
could
not
afford
to
lose
so
valuable
an
implement
a
indian
trail
leading
up
the
river
gave
us
easy
going
and
we
made
good
time
the
effects
of
light
and
colour
all
around
us
playing
over
the
mountains
and
valley
gave
the
surroundings
a
weird
interest
the
day
was
ending
long
shadows
stole
across
the
strange
topography
while
the
lights
on
the
variegated
buttes
became
kaleidoscopic
as
for
us
we
appeared
ridiculously
inadequate
we
ought
to
have
been
at
least
twenty
feet
high
to
fit
the
hour
and
the
scene
gradually
the
lights
faded
the
shadows
faded
then
both
began
to
merge
till
a
soft
dropped
over
all
blending
into
the
sky
everywhere
except
west
where
the
burnish
of
sunset
remained
before
dark
the
old
camp
was
reached
we
found
the
saw
by
the
last
dying
rays
and
then
picked
our
backward
path
by
starlight
following
the
trail
as
we
had
come
silence
and
the
night
were
one
as
in
the
countless
years
that
had
carved
the
dim
buttes
from
the
rocks
of
the
world
primeval
when
man
was
not
beautiful
is
the
wilderness
at
all
times
at
all
times
lovely
but
under
the
spell
of
the
twilight
it
seems
to
enfold
one
in
a
tender
embrace
pushing
back
the
sordid
the
commonplace
and
obliterating
those
magnified
nothings
that
form
the
weary
burden
of
civilised
man
with
keen
appreciation
we
tramped
steadily
on
till
at
last
we
perceived
through
the
night
gloom
the
cheerful
flicker
of
our
a
sight
always
welcome
for
the
to
the
explorer
is
home
at
eight
the
next
morning
our
business
was
resumed
with
the
major
happy
in
his
accustomed
place
we
made
a
nice
run
of
eighteen
miles
on
a
smooth
shallow
river
with
broken
picturesque
low
cliffs
and
isolated
buttes
everywhere
the
valley
was
wide
and
filled
with
these
rocky
hills
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
each
side
of
the
river
there
were
cottonwood
groves
offering
fine
spots
for
camping
before
and
after
crossing
there
seemed
to
be
several
places
where
crossing
was
accomplished
at
one
of
these
we
discovered
where
some
indians
had
been
in
camp
a
few
hours
before
the
placidity
of
the
river
permitted
the
lashing
together
of
the
boats
once
more
for
a
time
and
while
we
drifted
this
way
down
with
the
easy
current
the
major
and
took
turns
at
reading
aloud
from
whittier
was
one
selection
that
was
quite
in
harmony
with
the
surroundings
while
other
poems
offered
a
delightful
contrast
there
were
songs
too
and
i
specially
identify
with
this
particular
locality
that
old
college
favourite
evelina
sweet
which
everybody
sang
and
which
the
major
often
sang
alone
as
he
peered
ahead
into
the
vista
unfolding
before
night
the
valley
narrowed
the
banks
looked
more
like
low
canyon
walls
and
the
current
stiffened
a
clump
of
small
cottonwoods
suggested
a
camp
as
the
sun
ran
down
and
there
we
halted
nor
did
we
go
on
the
next
day
as
the
major
desired
to
go
out
to
a
ridge
lying
to
the
west
which
he
had
seen
from
his
horse
on
his
way
to
us
across
country
jones
went
with
him
and
they
came
back
with
a
fine
collection
of
cretaceous
fossils
steward
and
cap
also
went
collecting
and
were
successful
our
surroundings
were
now
even
more
peculiar
than
heretofore
in
many
places
the
region
was
absolutely
barren
of
all
vegetation
thousands
of
acres
at
a
time
had
upon
them
hardly
a
living
plant
of
any
description
being
simply
bare
and
barren
rock
as
devoid
of
soil
as
the
deck
of
a
ship
took
observations
for
latitude
and
longitude
and
the
rest
of
us
were
busy
at
our
usual
affairs
we
had
very
little
time
to
spare
when
the
various
necessary
duties
had
been
regularly
attended
to
illustration
dellenbaugh
butte
near
mouth
of
san
rafael
photograph
by
beaman
as
we
went
on
the
next
morning
the
desolation
of
the
surroundings
increased
if
that
were
possible
and
it
was
easy
to
read
in
this
one
cause
of
the
tardiness
of
its
exploration
the
acreage
of
bare
rock
grew
wider
and
broader
the
buttes
now
often
turned
to
walls
about
feet
high
all
much
broken
but
indicating
the
approach
to
another
closing
in
of
the
rocks
upon
us
many
of
these
buttes
were
beautiful
in
their
castellated
form
as
well
as
because
of
a
picturesque
banded
character
and
opposite
our
which
was
on
a
ledge
of
rock
was
one
surprisingly
symmetrical
resembling
an
artificial
structure
i
thought
it
looked
like
an
art
gallery
and
the
major
said
it
ought
to
be
named
after
the
artist
so
he
called
it
dellenbaugh
butte
then
and
there
another
singular
feature
of
this
day
was
a
number
of
alkaline
springs
discovered
bubbling
up
from
the
bottom
of
a
sort
of
bayou
or
branch
of
the
river
there
were
at
least
of
them
one
throwing
a
column
six
or
eight
inches
above
the
surface
of
the
water
here
about
two
feet
deep
we
thought
the
place
worth
a
name
and
called
it
undine
springs
three
or
four
miles
below
the
butte
named
after
me
we
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
a
river
feet
wide
and
eight
or
ten
inches
deep
coming
in
from
the
right
this
was
the
san
rafael
our
camp
was
made
near
some
cottonwoods
between
its
left
bank
and
the
green
as
soon
as
we
landed
we
perceived
that
the
ground
was
strewn
with
flaked
chips
of
chalcedony
jasper
and
similar
stones
it
was
plain
that
here
was
a
favourite
workshop
of
the
native
arrowhead
maker
an
artisan
now
vanished
forever
numerous
beautiful
of
stone
were
found
all
being
placed
in
the
general
collection
for
the
smithsonian
institution
our
camp
was
elevated
considerably
above
the
river
and
the
surroundings
being
open
we
had
views
in
all
directions
towards
the
east
we
could
see
the
sierra
la
sal
two
clusters
of
rounded
peaks
forty
or
fifty
miles
away
forming
a
majestic
picture
the
place
was
easy
of
access
and
had
been
a
favourite
resort
for
natives
several
acres
of
camp
remains
being
found
in
the
morning
began
a
series
of
observations
to
fix
the
position
of
the
mouth
of
the
san
rafael
while
the
major
and
jones
with
rations
blankets
on
their
backs
for
a
two
days
trip
started
early
up
the
tributary
stream
to
see
what
kind
of
a
country
it
flowed
through
steward
feeling
somewhat
under
the
weather
did
not
attempt
to
do
anything
while
the
photographer
and
the
others
busied
themselves
in
their
respective
lines
the
following
day
the
major
and
jones
returned
as
planned
having
traced
the
san
rafael
for
miles
before
they
arrived
cap
and
clem
went
across
the
green
to
travel
eastward
to
some
high
red
buttes
one
of
which
they
intended
to
climb
for
topographical
purposes
these
buttes
loomed
up
in
a
striking
way
and
appeared
to
be
no
more
than
six
miles
off
even
to
cap
experienced
eye
the
major
described
the
drainage
basin
of
the
san
rafael
as
wofully
barren
and
desolate
like
the
rest
of
our
surroundings
they
had
seen
mountains
lying
beyond
the
dirty
devil
river
which
were
the
range
we
then
called
the
unknown
mountains
there
being
no
record
of
any
one
ever
having
seen
them
before
the
major
on
his
first
trip
steward
recovering
his
poise
walked
back
alone
on
the
east
bank
of
the
green
four
miles
to
dellenbaugh
butte
to
examine
it
and
the
intervening
geology
he
found
the
butte
to
be
about
four
hundred
feet
high
and
composed
of
stratified
gypsum
thinly
bedded
and
of
fine
quality
as
evening
approached
we
looked
for
the
return
of
cap
and
clem
especially
when
the
supper
hour
arrived
but
twilight
came
then
darkness
and
still
their
footfall
was
not
heard
the
major
was
greatly
disturbed
over
their
failure
to
come
fearing
they
had
gotten
out
of
water
missed
their
way
and
might
now
be
suffering
or
demoralised
in
the
arid
wastes
to
eastward
he
ordered
a
large
fire
to
be
built
on
a
high
spot
near
camp
where
it
would
be
visible
for
miles
in
the
direction
the
missing
men
had
gone
we
divided
into
watches
of
two
hours
each
to
keep
the
fire
going
in
order
that
the
men
should
have
a
guide
if
they
were
trying
to
reach
the
river
in
the
night
i
was
called
for
my
turn
at
two
in
the
morning
and
read
whittier
while
feeding
the
flames
the
sky
was
mottled
with
clouds
driving
impetuously
across
the
zenith
the
bright
moon
gleaming
through
the
interstices
as
they
rapidly
passed
along
my
attention
was
divided
between
the
quaker
poet
the
blazing
fire
the
mysterious
environment
into
which
i
peered
from
time
to
time
and
the
flying
scud
playing
with
the
moon
at
three
i
called
andy
who
had
breakfast
ready
before
five
and
all
hands
were
up
prepared
to
start
on
a
search
by
the
time
we
had
eaten
there
was
light
enough
for
operations
to
begin
and
the
major
accompanied
by
jack
carrying
between
them
two
days
rations
and
as
much
water
as
possible
were
put
across
the
green
to
strike
out
directly
eastward
a
couple
of
hours
later
took
a
boat
with
steward
and
me
to
man
it
and
another
supply
of
food
and
water
and
ran
down
the
river
a
mile
where
we
headed
back
into
the
dry
region
to
intersect
at
a
distance
the
route
the
major
was
following
we
had
not
gone
far
before
signal
shots
came
to
our
ears
and
through
a
glass
turned
in
that
direction
we
rejoiced
to
see
that
the
major
and
jack
had
met
the
lost
ones
and
all
was
well
directed
me
to
go
back
on
foot
to
our
camp
with
instructions
for
the
other
boats
to
come
down
while
he
in
response
to
further
signals
dropped
his
boat
to
a
point
nearer
to
the
position
of
the
rescue
party
and
easier
for
them
to
reach
cap
had
underestimated
the
distance
to
the
butte
which
was
twice
as
far
as
he
thought
they
walked
eight
hours
to
get
there
only
to
discover
that
scaling
it
was
out
of
the
question
a
mile
and
a
half
beyond
they
found
one
they
could
climb
but
by
the
time
they
had
completed
their
observations
on
top
of
this
evening
overtook
them
and
they
were
at
least
fifteen
miles
from
camp
having
consumed
their
lunch
at
noon
and
drank
all
their
water
they
were
in
something
of
a
predicament
but
luckily
found
some
in
the
barren
rock
recently
filled
by
the
rains
so
they
did
not
suffer
for
thirst
and
going
hungry
is
not
dangerous
over
the
wide
surfaces
of
bare
rock
they
travelled
toward
camp
till
night
forced
them
to
wait
for
daylight
when
they
kept
on
till
they
met
the
major
and
jack
with
water
and
food
no
sooner
had
i
arrived
at
the
camp
than
the
sky
which
was
leaden
and
low
began
to
drop
its
burden
upon
us
packing
up
could
not
be
done
till
the
rain
slackened
and
we
sheltered
ourselves
as
well
as
we
could
as
we
waited
a
deep
roaring
sound
from
not
far
off
presently
fell
on
our
ears
and
we
were
puzzled
to
explain
it
till
an
examination
showed
a
recently
dry
gulch
filled
with
a
muddy
torrent
which
leaped
the
low
cliff
into
the
river
a
sullen
cascade
the
san
rafael
too
was
a
booming
flood
we
packed
the
boats
as
soon
as
we
could
and
ran
down
about
two
miles
and
a
half
to
where
the
first
boat
was
cliffs
bordered
the
river
again
to
feet
high
then
or
and
we
saw
we
were
in
the
beginning
of
the
next
canyon
called
from
its
winding
course
labyrinth
over
these
straight
walls
hundreds
of
beautiful
cascades
born
of
the
rain
were
plunging
into
the
river
they
were
of
all
sizes
all
heights
and
almost
all
colours
chocolate
amber
and
red
predominating
the
rocky
walls
mainly
of
a
low
tint
were
cut
into
by
the
river
till
the
outside
curves
of
the
bends
were
perpendicular
and
sometimes
slightly
more
than
perpendicular
so
that
some
of
the
cascades
fell
clear
without
a
break
the
acres
of
bare
rock
composing
the
surface
of
the
land
on
both
sides
collected
the
rain
as
does
the
roof
of
a
house
and
the
rills
and
rivulets
rapidly
uniting
soon
formed
veritable
floods
of
considerable
proportions
seeking
the
bosom
of
the
river
this
seemed
the
most
fantastic
region
we
had
yet
encountered
buttes
pinnacles
turrets
spires
castles
gulches
alcoves
canyons
and
canyons
all
hewn
as
the
years
of
eternity
roll
out
of
the
verdureless
labyrinth
of
solid
rock
made
us
feel
more
than
ever
a
sense
of
intruding
into
a
forbidden
realm
and
having
permanently
parted
from
the
world
we
formerly
knew
about
noon
we
caught
up
to
the
other
boat
and
all
had
dinner
together
happy
that
nothing
serious
had
befallen
cap
and
clem
during
the
whole
afternoon
rain
steadily
fell
upon
the
top
of
this
world
till
the
river
rose
several
inches
while
its
colour
turned
to
a
dull
yellow
then
to
a
red
showing
how
heavy
the
rainfall
had
been
in
the
back
country
we
had
our
rubber
ponchos
on
but
we
were
more
or
less
damp
and
we
began
to
notice
that
summer
had
passed
for
the
air
was
chilly
the
river
was
perfectly
smooth
making
navigation
easy
and
we
were
able
to
pull
steadily
along
with
no
interruption
from
rapids
the
walls
ever
increased
their
height
while
over
the
edges
the
numberless
astonishing
rain
cascades
continued
to
play
varying
their
volume
according
to
the
downpour
from
the
sky
before
long
the
cliffs
were
from
to
feet
high
often
perpendicular
giving
the
waterfalls
grand
plunges
these
graceful
tributaries
were
now
occasionally
perfectly
clear
and
they
sometimes
fell
so
far
without
a
break
that
they
vanished
in
feathery
white
spray
a
projecting
ledge
at
times
might
gather
this
spray
again
to
form
a
second
cascade
before
the
river
level
was
reached
the
scene
was
quite
magical
and
considering
the
general
aridity
for
a
large
part
of
the
year
it
appeared
almost
like
a
phantasm
a
land
of
streams
some
like
a
downward
smoke
slow
dropping
veils
of
thinnest
lawn
did
go
the
river
twisted
this
way
and
that
with
the
tongues
of
the
bends
filled
with
alluvial
deposit
bearing
dense
clumps
of
and
grass
each
new
bend
presented
a
fresh
picture
with
the
changing
waterfalls
leaping
over
by
the
dozen
till
we
might
have
thought
ourselves
in
some
norwegian
fiord
and
we
gave
far
more
attention
to
admiring
the
scenery
than
to
navigating
the
boats
late
in
the
day
we
landed
at
the
left
on
the
point
of
a
bend
and
chopped
a
path
through
the
thick
oak
brush
to
a
grassy
glade
where
we
soon
had
the
paulins
stretched
across
oars
supported
by
other
oars
forming
comfortable
shelters
in
front
of
which
huge
fires
of
dead
oak
and
driftwood
were
kept
going
to
dry
things
out
andy
set
his
pots
to
boiling
and
supper
was
soon
prepared
all
night
the
rain
fell
but
our
shelters
kept
us
dry
and
every
one
had
a
good
rest
when
the
morning
of
september
dawned
clear
and
bracing
we
met
it
with
good
spirits
though
the
spirits
of
our
party
seldom
varied
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
and
every
man
took
as
much
personal
interest
in
the
success
of
the
expedition
as
if
he
were
entirely
responsible
for
it
in
order
that
beaman
might
take
some
pictures
and
the
topographers
get
notes
no
move
was
made
climbed
out
obtaining
a
wide
view
in
all
directions
and
securing
valuable
data
i
also
went
up
on
the
cliffs
and
made
a
pencil
sketch
and
in
the
afternoon
we
explored
a
peculiar
side
canyon
across
the
river
three
canyons
came
together
at
their
mouths
and
we
called
the
place
trin
alcove
and
the
major
walked
up
it
some
distance
and
then
sent
for
beaman
to
come
to
photograph
at
nightfall
rain
began
once
more
and
the
shelters
were
again
erected
over
the
oars
another
morning
came
fair
and
we
went
on
leaving
beaman
to
finish
up
views
and
the
crew
for
other
work
as
we
proceeded
we
would
occasionally
halt
to
wait
but
it
was
noon
before
they
overtook
us
rain
had
begun
before
this
and
continued
at
intervals
during
the
dinner
stop
as
soon
as
we
started
we
ran
into
a
heavy
downpour
and
while
pulling
along
in
the
midst
of
this
our
boat
ran
on
a
and
got
so
far
and
fast
aground
that
it
required
all
ten
men
to
get
her
off
the
other
crews
walking
in
the
water
to
where
we
were
as
the
shoal
was
very
wide
while
thus
engaged
a
beautiful
colour
effect
developed
softly
before
us
through
an
opalescent
vaporous
shroud
the
sun
came
forth
with
brilliant
power
upon
the
retreating
mists
creating
a
clear
luminous
prismatic
bow
ahead
of
us
arching
in
perfect
symmetry
from
foot
to
foot
of
the
glistening
walls
while
high
above
it
resting
each
end
on
the
first
terraces
a
second
one
equally
distinct
bridged
the
chasm
and
exactly
where
these
gorgeous
rainbows
touched
the
rocks
roaring
rain
cascades
leaped
down
to
add
their
charm
to
the
enchanting
picture
we
were
now
at
the
beginning
of
a
very
long
loop
of
the
river
which
we
named
bend
just
at
the
start
of
this
great
turn
we
camped
with
a
record
for
the
whole
day
of
miles
steward
found
some
fragments
of
pottery
the
next
morning
we
remained
here
till
ten
for
views
and
then
we
left
beaman
on
the
summit
of
the
low
dividing
ridge
where
one
could
look
into
the
river
on
either
side
and
see
a
point
which
we
rowed
more
than
five
miles
to
reach
on
the
right
bank
we
stopped
for
dinner
and
when
it
was
about
ready
several
of
us
crossed
and
helping
beaman
down
with
his
heavy
boxes
ferried
him
to
our
side
the
opposite
bank
was
no
more
than
one
thousand
feet
in
a
straight
line
from
our
of
the
morning
instead
of
now
going
on
a
halt
was
made
because
steward
prowling
around
after
his
custom
had
found
some
fossils
that
were
important
and
he
wanted
more
the
major
with
jack
crossed
the
river
for
further
geological
investigations
while
and
jones
started
to
climb
out
though
the
prospect
was
not
encouraging
they
ascended
over
rock
strangely
eroded
by
water
into
caverns
and
holes
then
along
a
ledge
till
jones
being
a
taller
man
than
got
up
and
pulled
after
him
with
his
revolver
belt
they
obtained
a
remarkable
view
buttes
ridges
mountains
stood
all
round
with
the
river
so
completely
lost
in
the
abruptness
of
its
chasm
that
a
mile
from
the
brink
the
whole
region
was
apparently
solid
and
the
existence
of
the
gorge
with
a
river
at
bottom
would
not
even
be
suspected
they
could
trace
the
line
of
grand
river
by
buttes
and
long
ridges
and
just
at
the
gap
formed
by
the
junction
with
the
green
a
blue
mountain
arose
the
sierra
la
sal
too
could
be
seen
lying
on
the
horizon
like
blue
clouds
weird
and
wild
barren
and
it
seemed
like
an
unknown
world
said
prof
the
country
was
a
vast
plateau
similar
to
the
one
through
which
the
canyon
of
desolation
is
carved
that
is
tilting
northward
and
increasing
in
altitude
towards
the
south
so
that
as
the
river
runs
on
its
canyon
becomes
deeper
from
this
cause
as
well
as
its
cutting
these
great
terraces
sloping
to
the
north
were
not
before
understood
they
terminate
on
the
south
in
vertical
cliffs
through
which
the
river
emerges
abruptly
from
such
features
as
these
the

the
cliffs
terminating
each
plateau

intricate
escarpments
meandering
for
many
miles
and
they
might
be
likened
to
a
series
of
irregular
and
complicated
steps
occasional
high
buttes
and
mountain
masses
break
the
surface
but
in
general
the
whole
area
forming
the

be
described

the
next
day
september
we
were
on
the
river
at
and
ran
about
seven
miles
on
smooth
water
before
we
stopped
for
a
rest
and
dinner
on
the
right
bank
as
well
as
to
enable
beaman
to
take
some
views
he
desired
another
three
miles
and
we
halted
again
for
geologising
and
for
photographs
while
taking
andy
in
his
boat
went
ahead
to
establish
a
camp
somewhere
below
for
the
night
in
order
that
we
would
not
be
so
late
getting
supper
the
days
were
now
growing
short
and
supper
by
firelight
was
a
common
thing
rain
soon
began
again
and
put
a
stop
to
the
work
driving
us
forward
between
the
scores
of
cascades
which
soon
began
to
leap
anew
from
every
height
to
the
river
at
one
place
a
waterfall
shot
out
from
behind
an
arch
set
against
the
wall
making
a
singular
but
beautiful
effect
and
revealing
to
us
one
method
by
which
some
of
the
arches
are
formed
the
place
had
selected
for
camp
was
reached
almost
the
same
time
that
he
got
there
it
was
on
the
left
among
the
greasewood
bushes
and
there
we
put
up
our
paulins
for
shelter
on
oars
as
before
we
had
made
about
fifteen
miles
the
walls
receded
from
the
river
forming
what
the
major
named
the
orange
cliffs
and
were
much
broken
while
the
back
country
could
be
seen
in
places
from
our
boats
scores
hundreds
multitudes
of
buttes
of
bare
rock
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
were
in
sight
and
one
was
called
the
butte
of
the
cross
because
it
suggested
a
cross
lying
down
from
one
position
though
from
another
it
was
seen
to
be
in
reality
two
distinct
masses
here
ended
labyrinth
canyon
according
to
the
major
decision
we
credited
it
with
a
length
of
miles
although
winding
through
an
extremely
arid
country
it
had
for
us
been
a
place
of
rain
and
waterfalls
and
even
though
rapids
were
absent
we
had
been
nevertheless
kept
rather
wet
there
was
not
much
change
in
structure
between
labyrinth
canyon
and
the
following
one
of
the
series
stillwater
the
interval
was
one
of
lowered
much
broken
walls
well
back
from
the
river
leaving
wide
bottom
lands
on
the
sides
we
went
ahead
in
the
morning
on
quiet
water
for
seven
or
eight
miles
and
stopped
on
a
high
bank
for
dinner
and
for
examinations
steward
and
the
major
climbed
out
steward
got
separated
from
the
others
by
trying
to
reach
a
rather
distant
butte
and
when
he
tried
to
rejoin
us
he
had
considerable
difficulty
in
doing
so
for
half
an
hour
he
searched
for
a
place
to
get
down
and
we
looked
for
one
also
from
the
bottom
and
finally
he
was
compelled
to
go
down
half
a
mile
farther
where
he
made
the
descent
only
to
find
himself
in
a
dense
jungle
of
willows
and
other
plants
we
had
to
cut
a
way
in
to
relieve
him
the
luxuriant
growth
of
these
plants
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
barrenness
of
the
plateau
was
due
not
so
much
to
aridity
as
to
the
peculiar
rock
formation
which
disintegrating
easily
under
the
frosts
and
rains
prevented
the
accumulation
of
soil
the
soil
was
washed
away
by
every
rain
and
carried
by
thousands
of
cataracts
into
the
river
only
when
the
country
reaches
the
base
level
of
erosion
as
the
major
called
it
would
vegetation
succeed
in
holding
its
place
that
is
when
the
declivity
of
the
surrounding
region
became
reduced
till
the
rain
torrents
should
lack
the
velocity
necessary
to
transport
any
great
load
of
detritus
and
the
disintegrated
material
would
accumulate
give
a
footing
to
plants
and
thus
further
protect
itself
and
the
rocks

the

and
now
decided
to
use
up
all
the
photographic
material
between
this
point
and
the
dirty
devil
and
leave
one
boat
at
the
latter
place
till
the
next
season
when
a
party
would
come
in
for
it
and
take
it
down
to
the
paria
we
would
be
obliged
to
examine
the
dirty
devil
region
then
in
any
event
three
miles
below
our
dinner
camp
we
arrived
at
a
remarkably
picturesque
bend
and
on
the
outer
circumference
we
made
our
sixtieth
camp
but
so
late
that
supper
was
eaten
by
firelight
the
bend
was
named
by
beaman
bonito
and
in
the
morning
he
made
a
number
of
views
the
bottom
lands
along
the
river
had
evidently
been
utilised
by
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
for
farming
as
fragments
of
pottery
occasionally
found
indicated
their
presence
here
in
former
days
it
was
afternoon
when
we
pushed
off
and
left
bonito
bend
behind
after
a
few
miles
the
major
and
tried
to
climb
out
but
they
failed
a
buff
sandstone
resting
on
red
shale
was
vertical
for
about
feet
everywhere
and
could
not
be
surmounted
above
this
stood
another
vertical
wall
of
five
hundred
feet
an
orange
coloured
sandstone
in
which
no
break
was
apparent
these
walls
closed
in
on
the
river
leaving
barely
a
margin
in
many
places
there
were
few
landings
the
current
rather
swift
and
smooth
swirling
along
the
foot
of
the
rocks
which
rose
vertically
for
feet
and
were
about
four
hundred
feet
apart
as
the
evening
came
on
we
could
find
no
place
to
stop
that
offered
room
enough
for
a
camp
and
we
drifted
on
and
on
till
almost
dark
when
we
discovered
a
patch
of
soil
on
the
right
that
would
give
us
sufficient
space
the
of
september
happened
to
be
my
birthday
and
andy
had
promised
to
stew
a
mess
of
dried
apples
in
celebration
this
does
not
sound
like
a
tremendous
treat
but
circumstances
give
the
test
our
supply
of
rations
being
limited
and
now
running
low
andy
for
some
time
had
been
curbing
our
appetites
stewed
dried
apples
were
granted
about
once
a
week
and
boiled
beans
were
an
equal
luxury
it
was
consequently
a
disappointment
not
to
get
the
promised
extra
allowance
of
apples
on
this
occasion
not
only
was
the
hour
late
but
there
was
little
wood
to
be
had
though
diligent
raking
around
produced
enough
driftwood
to
cook
our
supper
of
bacon
coffee
and
bread
our
camp
was
beneath
an
overhanging
cliff
about
six
hundred
feet
high
and
the
walls
near
us
were
so
heavily
coated
with
salt
that
it
could
be
broken
off
in
chunks
anywhere
the
quarters
were
not
roomy
but
we
got
a
good
sleep
in
the
morning
before
he
was
fairly
awake
steward
discovered
fossils
in
the
rocks
over
his
head
and
we
remained
till
one
in
order
that
an
investigation
could
be
made
he
collected
about
a
peck
of
fine
specimens
when
we
started
again
the
canyon
was
so
interesting
particularly
to
the
geologists
that
we
stopped
several
times
in
a
run
of
five
miles
between
vertical
walls
not
over
six
hundred
feet
apart
camp
was
finally
made
on
the
right
in
a
sort
of
alcove
with
a
level
fertile
bottom
of
several
acres
where
the
ancients
had
grown
corn
evidences
of
their
former
life
here
were
numerous
steward
climbing
on
the
cliffs
suddenly
gave
a
loud
shout
announcing
a
discovery
he
had
found
two
small
huts
built
into
the
rocks
several
of
us
went
up
to
look
at
them
they
were
of
great
age
and
so
small
that
they
could
have
been
only
storage
places
withered
and
hardened
corncobs
were
found
within
them
on
returning
to
camp
we
learned
that
the
major
had
found
some
larger
house
ruins
on
a
terrace
some
distance
up
the
river
around
the
that
evening
he
told
us
something
about
the
shinumos
as
he
called
them
who
long
ago
had
inhabited
this
region
and
in
imagination
we
now
beheld
them
again
climbing
the
cliffs
or
toiling
at
their
agriculture
in
the
small
bottom
land
at
daylight
steward
clem
and
i
went
up
to
the
ruins
which
stood
on
a
terrace
projecting
in
such
a
way
that
a
clear
view
could
be
had
up
and
down
the
river
there
were
two
houses
built
of
stone
slabs
each
about
feet
and
about
six
feet
of
wall
were
still
standing
thirty
feet
or
more
below
ran
the
river
and
there
were
remains
of
an
old
stairway
leading
down
through
a
crevice
to
the
river
but
too
much
disintegrated
for
us
to
descend
these
were
the
first
ruins
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
was
as
much
interested
in
them
as
i
afterwards
was
in
the
colosseum
being
desirous
of
arriving
as
speedily
as
possible
at
the
junction
of
the
grand
with
the
green
which
was
now
not
far
off
for
the
purpose
of
getting
an
observation
for
time
left
us
at
seven
and
proceeded
in
advance
while
the
remainder
of
the
party
turned
their
attention
to
the
locality
where
we
were
we
could
see
traces
of
an
old
trail
up
the
cliffs
and
the
major
jack
andy
and
jones
started
to
follow
this
out
with
the
aid
of
ropes
taken
along
and
stones
piled
up
as
well
as
a
cottonwood
pole
that
had
been
placed
as
a
ladder
by
the
ancients
they
succeeded
in
reaching
the
summit
clem
and
i
went
back
to
the
large
house
ruins
for
a
and
looked
over
the
quantities
of
broken
arrowheads
of
jasper
and
the
potsherds
strewing
the
place
in
search
of
specimens
of
value
on
the
return
trip
of
the
climbers
andy
discovered
an
earthen
jar
fifteen
inches
high
and
about
twelve
inches
in
diameter
of
the
type
under
a
sheltering
rock
covered
by
a
piece
of
flat
stone
where
it
had
rested
for
many
a
decade
if
not
for
a
century
it
contained
a
small
coil
of
such
as
is
used
in
basketry
tied
with
cord
of
aboriginal
make
some
one
had
placed
it
there
for
a
few
moments
after
dinner
we
continued
down
the
canyon
taking
the
pot
with
us
the
walls
were
nearly
vertical
on
both
sides
or
at
any
rate
appeared
so
to
us
from
the
boats
and
they
often
came
straight
into
the
water
with
here
and
there
a
few
willows
they
were
not
more
than
feet
apart
no
rapids
troubled
us
and
the
current
was
less
than
three
miles
an
hour
but
we
seemed
to
be
going
swiftly
even
without
rowing
after
about
seven
miles
the
trend
of
the
chasm
became
easterly
and
we
saw
the
mouth
of
the
grand
the
junction
that
hidden
mystery
which
unless
we
count
julien
only
nine
white
men
the
major
first
party
had
ever
seen
before
us
the
grand
entered
through
a
canyon
similar
to
that
of
the
green
all
the
immediate
walls
being
at
least
feet
and
the
summit
of
the
plateau
about
feet
above
the
river
on
the
right
was
a
small
bench
perhaps
of
a
mile
long
and
several
rods
wide
fringed
by
a
on
which
we
found
the
crew
of
the
established
in
camp
between
the
two
rivers

another
footing
of
about
two
acres
bearing
several
hackberry
trees
and
it
was
on
this
bank
up
the
grand
river
side
that
the
first
party
camped
across
on
the
east
shore
we
could
see
still
another
strip
with
some
bushes
but
there
was
no
more
horizontal
land
to
be
found
here
the
two
rivers
blended
gracefully
on
nearly
equal
terms
and
the
doubled
volume
started
down
with
reckless
impetuosity
this
was
the
end

had
finished
the

boat
and
dropped
it
down
two
or
three
hundred
yards
to
a
place
where
the
conditions
were
better
and
camped
by
it
there
were
a
few
small
cottonwoods
against
the
cliff
behind
the
but
they
were
too
far
off
to
be
reached
by
our
lines
and
the
ground
beneath
them
was
too
irregular
and
rocky
for
a
camp
these
trees
with
the
hackberry
trees
across
the
river
and
numerous
stramonium
bushes
in
full
blossom
composed
the
chief
vegetation
of
this
extraordinary
locality
no
more
remote
place
existed
at
that
time
within
the
united
states
no
place
more
difficult
of
access
macomb
in
his
reconnaissance
in
had
tried
hard
to
arrive
here
but
he
got
no
nearer
than
the
edge
of
the
plateau
about
thirty
miles
up
grand
river
it
was
necessary
that
we
should
secure
topographic
notes
and
observations
from
the
summit
and
we
scanned
the
surroundings
for
the
most
promising
place
for
exit
the
major
was
sure
we
could
make
a
successful
ascent
to
the
upper
regions
by
way
of
a
narrow
cleft
on
the
right
or
west
some
distance
back
up
the
green
which
he
had
noted
as
we
came
along
so
in
the
morning
of
saturday
september
he
and
jack
beaman
clem
jones
and
i
rowed
up
in
the
the
current
being
slow
along
the
west
bank
and
started
up
the
crevice
dragging
the
cumbrous
photographic
outfit
along
remained
below
for
observations
for
time
the
cleft
was
filled
with
fallen
rocks
and
we
had
no
trouble
mounting
except
that
the
photographic
boxes
were
like
lead
and
the
straps
across
one
chest
made
breathing
difficult
the
climb
was
tiring
but
there
was
no
obstacle
and
we
presently
emerged
on
the
surface
of
the
country
feet
above
the
river
and
above
the
sea
here
was
revealed
a
wide
cyclorama
that
was
astounding
nothing
was
in
sight
but
barren
sandstone
red
yellow
brown
grey
carved
into
an
amazing
multitude
of
towers
buttes
spires
pinnacles
some
of
them
several
hundred
feet
high
and
all
shimmering
under
a
dazzling
sun
it
was
a
marvellous
mighty
desert
of
bare
rock
chiselled
by
the
ages
out
of
the
foundations
of
the
globe
fantastic
extraordinary
antediluvian
labyrinthian
and
slashed
in
all
directions
by
crevices
crevices
wide
crevices
narrow
crevices
medium
some
shallow
some
dropping
till
a
falling
stone
clanked
resounding
into
the
far
hollow
depths
scarcely
could
we
travel
a
hundred
yards
but
we
were
compelled
to
leap
some
deep
dark
crack
often
they
were
so
wide
a
running
jump
was
necessary
and
at
times
the
smooth
rock
sloped
on
both
sides
toward
the
crevice
rather
steeply
once
the
major
came
sliding
down
a
bare
slope
till
at
a
point
where
he
caught
sight
of
the
edge
of
a
sombre
fissure
just
where
he
must
land
he
could
not
see
its
width
he
could
not
return
and
there
he
hung
luckily
i
was
where
by
another
path
i
could
quickly
reach
the
rock
below
and
i
saw
that
the
crevice
was
not
six
inches
wide
and
i
shouted
the
joyful
news
steward
had
not
come
up
with
us
but
had
succeeded
in
ascending
through
a
narrow
crevice
below
camp
he
soon
arrived
within
speaking
distance
but
there
he
was
foiled
by
a
crack
too
wide
to
jump
and
he
had
to
remain
a
stranger
to
us
the
rest
of
the
day
at
a
little
distance
back
from
the
brink
these
crevices
were
not
so
numerous
nor
so
wide
and
there
we
discovered
a
series
of
extremely
pretty
parks
lost
amidst
the
million
turreted
rocks
i
made
a
pencil
sketch
looking
out
into
this
as
the
major
called
it
from
information
obtained
from
the
utes
beaman
secured
a
number
of
photographs
but
not
all
that
were
desired
and
as
we
did
not
have
rations
for
stopping
on
the
summit
we
went
back
to
camp
and
made
the
climb
again
the
next
day
fortunately
the
recent
rains
had
filled
many
hollows
in
the
bare
rock
forming
pockets
of
delicious
pure
water
where
we
could
drink
but
on
a
hot
and
dry
summer
day
travelling
here
would
be
intolerable
if
not
impossible
fragments
of
chips
of
chalcedony
and
quantities
of
potsherds
scattered
around
proved
that
our
ancient
shinumos
had
known
the
region
well
doubtless
some
of
their
old
trails
would
lead
to
large
and
deep
there
are
in
this
bare
sandstone
of
enormous
size
often
several
feet
in
depth
and
of
similar
diameter
which
become
filled
with
that
lasts
a
long
time
the
shinumos
had
numerous
dwellings
all
through
this
country
with
trails
leading
from
place
to
place
highways
and
byways
the
following
day
the
major
and
jones
climbed
out
on
the
side
opposite
camp
that
is
on
the
east
side
where
they
found
an
old
trail
and
evidences
of
camping
during
the
summer
just
closed
probably
by
the
utes
that
night
jones
in
attempting
to
enter
our
boat
in
the
moonlight
stepped
on
the
corner
of
the
hatch
of
the
middle
cabin
which
was
not
on
securely
it
tipped
and
he
was
thrown
in
such
a
way
as
to
severely
injure
his
leg
below
the
knee
this
was
the
first
mishap
thus
far
to
any
one
of
the
party
the
major
entertained
some
idea
of
making
a
boat
trip
up
the
grand
but
he
abandoned
it
and
we
prepared
for
the
work
ahead
the
rations
which
were
now
fallen
to
poverty
bulk
were
carefully
overhauled
and
evenly
distributed
among
the
boats
so
that
the
wrecking
of
any
one
would
not
deprive
us
of
more
than
a
portion
of
each
article
the
amount
for
daily
use
was
also
determined
of
the
bacon
we
were
to
have
at
a
meal
only
half
the
usual
quantity
we
knew
cataract
canyon
was
rough
but
by
this
time
we
were
in
excellent
training
and
thoroughly
competent
for
the
kind
of
navigation
required
ready
for
anything
that
strong
boats
like
ours
could
live
through
at
ten
on
tuesday
september
the
cabins
were
all
packed
the
life
preservers
were
inflated
and
casting
off
from
camp
we
were
borne
down
with
the
swift
current
the
water
was
muddy
of
a
colour
and
the
river
was
falling
not
far
below
our
camp
we
saw
a
beaten
trail
coming
down
a
singular
canyon
on
the
left
or
east
side
showing
again
that
the
natives
understood
the
way
in
to
the
junction
we
knew
it
was
not
far
to
rapids
as
we
had
seen
two
heavy
ones
from
the
brink
above
and
we
soon
heard
the
familiar
roar
of
plunging
water
a
sound
which
had
been
absent
since
the
end
of
gray
canyon
presently
we
were
bearing
down
on
the
first
one
looking
for
the
way
to
pass
it
on
landing
at
the
head
it
was
seen
to
be
a
rather
rough
place
and
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
avoid
running
it
the
boats
were
carefully
let
down
by
lines
and
we
went
on
in
a
short
distance
we
reached
a
second
rapid
where
we
decided
to
repeat
the
operation
that
took
us
past
the
other
but
these
two
consumed
much
time
and
gave
us
hard
work
the
water
was
cold
we
were
wet
and
hungry
and
when
we
arrived
at
a
third
that
was
more
forbidding
than
the
ones
above
we
halted
for
dinner
at
its
beginning
the
muddy
water
boomed
and
plunged
over
innumerable
rocks
a
mad
irresistible
flood
so
great
was
the
declivity
of
the
river
bed
that
boulders
were
rolled
along
under
water
with
a
sound
like
distant
thunder
we
had
noticed
this
also
in
lodore
but
in
cataract
it
was
more
common
the
rumbling
was
particularly
noticeable
if
one
were
standing
in
the
water
as
we
so
continually
were
after
dinner
the
boats
were
lowered
past
the
rapid
but
we
had
no
respite
for
presently
we
came
upon
another
big
one
then
another
and
another
and
then
still
another
all
following
quickly
and
giving
us
plenty
of
extremely
hard
work
for
we
would
not
risk
the
boats
in
any
of
them
when
these
were
behind
us
we
went
on
a
distance
and
came
to
one
that
we
ran
and
then
wet
through
and
shivering
till
our
teeth
chattered
as
well
as
being
hungry
and
tired
every
one
was
glad
to
hear
the
decision
to
go
into
camp
when
we
arrived
at
the
top
of
another
very
ugly
pair
of
them
the
canyon
having
a
north
and
south
trend
and
it
being
autumn
the
sun
disappeared
early
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
the
shadows
were
deep
the
mountain
air
was
penetrating
as
soon
as
possible
our
soaking
river
garments
were
thrown
off
the
dry
clothing
from
the
rubber
bags
was
put
on
the
limited
bacon
was
sending
its
fragrance
into
the
troubled
air
the
bread
took
on
a
nice
deep
brown
in
the
dutch
oven
the
coffee
aromatic
steam
drifted
from
the
fire
and
warm
and
comfortable
we
sat
down
to
the
welcome
though
meagre
meal
the
rule
was
three
little
strips
of
bacon
a
chunk
of
bread
about
the
size
of
fist
and
coffee
without
stint
for
each
man
three
times
a
day
sugar
was
a
scarce
article
and
i
learned
to
like
coffee
without
it
so
well
that
i
have
never
taken
it
with
sugar
since
the
tirtaan
aigles
needed
now
all
the
muscle
and
energy
they
could
command
and
an
early
hour
found
every
man
sound
asleep
the
record
for
the
first
day
in
cataract
canyon
was
nine
miles
with
eight
bad
rapids
or
cataracts
as
they
might
properly
be
called
and
out
of
the
eight
we
ran
but
one
the
river
was
about
feet
wide

clement
powell
cataract
canyon
photograph
by
beaman
the
major
decided
the
next
morning
that
he
would
try
to
get
out
on
the
right
and
he
took
me
with
him
we
had
no
great
trouble
in
reaching
the
plateau
at
an
elevation
of
eighteen
hundred
feet
above
the
river
where
we
could
see
an
immense
area
of
unknown
country
the
broken
and
pinnacled
character
was
not
so
marked
as
it
had
been
at
the
junction
but
it
was
still
a
strange
barren
land
we
expected
to
find
on
the
top
and
we
had
carried
with
us
only
one
quart
canteen
of
water
while
the
major
was
taking
notes
from
the
summit
of
a
butte
i
made
a
zealous
search
for
water
but
not
a
drop
could
i
find
every
hole
was
dry
the
sun
burned
down
from
a
clear
sky
that
melted
black
into
eternal
space
the
yellow
sand
threw
the
hot
rays
upward
and
so
also
did
the
smooth
bare
rock
no
bird
no
bee
no
thing
of
life
could
be
seen
i
came
to
a
whitish
cliff
upon
which
i
thought
there
might
be
and
i
mounted
by
a
steep
slope
of
broken
stones
suddenly
almost
within
touch
i
saw
before
me
a
golden
yellow
rattlesnake
gliding
upward
in
the
direction
i
was
going
along
the
cliff
wall
i
killed
it
with
a
stone
and
cut
off
the
rattles
and
continued
my
reconnaissance
at
length
i
gave
up
the
search
by
the
time
i
had
returned
to
the
foot
of
the
butte
on
which
the
major
was
making
his
observations
the
heat
had
exhausted
me
till
i
was
obliged
to
rest
a
few
moments
before
ascending
the
sixty
feet
to
where
he
was
i
had
carried
the
canteen
all
the
time
and
the
water
in
it
was
hot
from
exposure
to
the
sun
the
major
bade
me
rest
while
he
made
a
little
fire
and
by
the
aid
of
a
can
and
ground
coffee
we
had
brought
he
made
a
strong
decoction
with
the
whole
quart
this
gave
us
two
cups
apiece
and
we
had
some
bread
to
go
with
it
the
effect
was
magical
my
fatigue
vanished
i
felt
equal
to
anything
and
we
began
the
return
the
major
having
no
right
arm
he
sometimes
got
in
a
difficult
situation
when
climbing
if
his
right
side
came
against
a
smooth
surface
where
there
was
nothing
opposite
we
had
learned
to
go
down
by
the
same
route
followed
up
because
otherwise
one
is
never
sure
of
arriving
at
the
bottom
as
a
ledge
down
might
compel
a
return
to
the
summit
we
remembered
that
at
one
point
there
was
no
way
for
him
to
hold
on
the
cliff
being
smooth
on
the
right
while
on
the
left
was
empty
air
with
a
sheer
drop
of
several
hundred
feet
the
footing
too
was
narrow
i
climbed
down
first
and
bracing
myself
below
with
my
back
to
the
abyss
i
was
able
to
plant
my
right
foot
securely
in
such
a
manner
that
my
right
knee
formed
a
solid
step
for
him
at
the
critical
moment
on
this
improvised
step
he
placed
his
left
foot
and
in
a
twinkling
had
made
the
passage
in
safety
during
our
absence
the
men
below
had
been
at
work
camp
was
moved
down
the
river
some
three
quarters
of
a
mile
while
the
boats
had
been
lowered
past
the
ugly
pair
of
rapids
and
were
moored
at
the
camp
below
the
second
in
one
the
current
had
got
the
bulge
as
we
called
it
on
the
men
on
the
line
that
is
the
powerful
current
had
hit
the
bow
in
such
a
way
that
the
boat
took
the
diagonal
of
forces
and
travelled
up
and
out
into
the
river
for
the
men
it
was
either
let
go
or
be
pulled
in
they
let
go
and
the
boat
dashed
down
with
her
cargo
on
board
fortune
was
on
our
side
she
went
through
without
injury
and
shot
into
an
eddy
below
with
all
speed
the
men
rushed
down
and
jack
plunging
in
swam
to
her
and
got
on
before
she
could
take
a
fresh
start
it
was
a
narrow
escape
but
it
taught
a
lesson
that
was
not
forgotten
had
succeeded
in
getting
some
observations
and
all
was
well
it
was
bean
day
too
according
to
our
calendar
and
all
hands
had
a
treat
by
eight
the
next
morning
thursday
september
we
were
on
the
way
again
with
the
boats
close
reefed
as
it
were
for
trouble
but
one
two
three
and
one
half
miles
slid
easily
behind
then
as
if
to
make
up
for
this
bit
of
leniency
six
rapids
came
in
close
succession
though
they
were
of
a
kind
that
we
could
safely
run
and
all
the
boats
went
flying
through
them
without
a
mishap
of
any
kind
the
next
was
a
plunger
so
mixed
up
with
rocks
that
we
made
a
and
again
proceeded
a
short
distance
before
we
were
halted
by
one
more
of
the
same
sort
though
we
were
able
to
run
the
lower
portion
of
it
a
little
below
this
we
met
a
friendly
drop
and
whizzed
through
its
rush
and
roar
in
triumph
but
there
was
nothing
triumphant
about
the
one
which
followed
so
far
as
our
work
was
concerned
we
manoeuvred
past
it
with
much
difficulty
only
to
find
ourselves
upon
two
more
bad
ones
bad
as
they
were
they
were
nevertheless
runable
and
away
we
dashed
with
breakneck
speed
certainly
not
less
than
twenty
miles
an
hour
down
both
of
them
to
land
on
the
left
immediately
at
the
beginning
of
a
great
and
forbidding
descent
these
were
difficult
often
requiring
all
hands
to
each
boat
except
the
major
whose
condition
made
it
too
hard
for
him
to
assist
in
the
midst
of
rocks
and
rushing
water
where
one
had
to
be
very
nimble
and
leap
and
balance
with
exactness
two
good
arms
were
barely
sufficient
sometimes
in
order
to
pass
the
gigantic
boulders
that
stretched
far
off
from
the
shore
the
boat
had
to
be
shot
around
and
hauled
in
below
an
operation
requiring
skill
strength
and
celerity
the
walls
very
craggy
at
the
top
increased
in
altitude
till
they
were
now
about
sixteen
hundred
feet
separated
from
each
other
by
one
third
of
a
mile
the
flaring
character
of
the
upper
miles
of
the
canyon
began
to
change
to
a
narrower
gorge
the
cliffs
showing
a
nearer
approach
to
verticality
at
the
head
of
the
forbidding
plunge
we
had
our
slice
of
bacon
with
bread
and
coffee
and
then
we
fought
our
way
down
alongside
amongst
immense
boulders
and
roaring
water
it
was
an
exceedingly
hard
place
to
vanquish
and
required
two
and
a
half
hours
of
the
most
violent
exertion
to
accomplish
it
all
were
necessary
to
handle
each
boat
hardly
had
we
passed
beyond
the
turmoil
of
its
fierce
opposition
than
we
fell
upon
another
scarcely
less
antagonistic
but
yet
apparently
so
free
from
rocks
that
the
major
concluded
it
could
be
run
at
the
outset
our
boat
struck
on
a
concealed
rock
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
we
might
capsize
but
luckily
she
righted
swung
free
and
swept
down
with
no
further
trouble
the
struck
the
same
rock
and
so
did
the
but
neither
was
injured
or
even
halted
these
boats
were
somewhat
lighter
than
ours
having
one
man
less
in
each
and
therefore
did
not
hit
the
rock
so
hard
the
boats
were
now
heavy
from
being
for
the
paint
was
gone
from
the
bottoms
this
would
have
made
no
difference
in
any
ordinary
waters
but
it
did
here
where
we
were
obliged
to
lift
them
so
constantly
this
was
an
extremely
rough
and
wet
day
work
and
the
moment
the
great
cliffs
cut
off
the
warmth
of
the
direct
sun
we
were
thrown
suddenly
from
summer
to
winter
and
our
saturated
clothing
uncomfortably
cool
in
sunlight
became
icy
with
the
evaporation
and
the
cold
we
turned
blue
and
no
matter
how
firmly
i
tried
to
shut
my
teeth
they
rattled
like
a
pair
of
castanets
though
it
was
only
three
the
major
decided
to
camp
as
soon
as
he
saw
this
effect
much
as
we
had
need
to
push
on
we
landed
on
the
right
and
were
soon
revived
by
dry
clothes
and
a
big
fire
of
driftwood
we
had
made
during
the
day
a
total
distance
of
a
trifle
less
than
seven
miles
one
and
three
quarters
since
dinner
there
were
fourteen
rapids
and
cataracts
nine
of
which
we
ran
on
a
river
about
two
hundred
feet
wide
we
had
sand
to
sleep
on
but
all
around
us
were
rocks
rocks
rocks
with
the
mighty
bounding
cliffs
lifting
up
to
the
sky
our
books
for
the
time
being
were
not
disturbed
but
whittier
lines
read
further
up
seemed
here
exactly
appropriate
to
the
colorado
hurrying
down
to
its
grave
the
sea
and
slow
through
the
rock
its
pathway
hewing
far
down
through
the
mist
of
the
falling
river
which
rises
up
like
an
incense
ever
the
splintered
points
of
the
crags
are
seen
with
water
howling
and
vexed
between
while
the
scooping
whirl
of
the
pool
beneath
seems
an
open
throat
with
its
granite
teeth
it
was
not
long
before
the
blankets
were
taken
from
the
rubber
bags
and
spread
on
the
sand
and
the
rapids
the
rocks
and
all
our
troubles
were
forgotten
the
next
day
was
almost
a
repetition
of
the
preceding
one
we
began
by
running
a
graceful
little
rapid
just
beyond
which
we
came
to
a
very
bad
place
the
river
was
narrow
and
deep
with
a
high
velocity
and
the
channel
was
filled
with
enormous
rocks
two
hours
of
the
hardest
kind
of
work
in
and
out
of
the
water
climbing
over
gigantic
boulders
along
the
bank
lifting
the
boats
and
sliding
them
on
driftwood
skids
tugging
pulling
shoving
every
minute
with
might
and
main
put
us
at
the
bottom
no
sooner
were
we
past
this
one
than
we
engaged
in
a
similar
battle
with
another
of
the
same
nature
and
below
it
we
stopped
for
dinner
amidst
some
huge
boulders
under
a
hackberry
tree
near
another
roarer
one
of
these
cataracts
had
a
fall
of
not
less
than
twenty
feet
in
six
hundred
which
gave
the
water
terrific
force
and
violence
the
canyon
walls
closed
in
more
and
more
and
ran
up
to
two
thousand
feet
apparently
nearly
vertical
as
one
looked
up
at
them
but
there
was
always
plenty
of
space
for
landings
and
camps
opposite
the
noon
camp
we
could
see
to
a
height
beyond
of
at
least
three
thousand
feet
we
were
in
the
heart
of
another
great
plateau
after
noon
we
attacked
the
very
bad
rapid
beside
whose
head
we
had
eaten
and
it
was
three
when
we
had
finished
it
the
boats
had
been
considerably
pounded
and
there
was
a
hole
in
the
and
a
plank
sprung
in
the
so
that
her
middle
cabin
was
half
full
of
water
the
iron
strip
on
the
keel
was
breaking
off
repairs
were
imperative
and
on
the
right
near
the
beginning
of
one
of
the
worst
falls
we
had
yet
seen
we
went
into
camp
for
the
rest
of
the
day
with
false
ribs
made
from
oars
we
strengthened
the
boats
and
put
them
in
condition
for
another
day
hammering
it
seemed
as
if
we
must
have
gone
this
day
quite
a
long
distance
but
on
footing
up
it
was
found
to
be
no
more
than
a
mile
and
a
quarter
darkness
now
fell
early
and
big
driftwood
fires
made
the
evenings
cheerful
there
was
a
vast
amount
of
driftwood
in
tremendous
piles
trees
limbs
boughs
railroad
ties
a
great
mixture
of
all
kinds
some
of
it
lying
full
fifty
feet
above
the
present
level
of
the
river
there
were
large
and
small
battered
and
limbless
the
ends
pounded
to
a
spongy
mass
of
splinters
our
bright
fires
enabled
us
to
read
or
to
write
up
notes
and
diaries
i
think
each
one
but
the
major
and
andy
kept
a
diary
and
faithfully
wrote
it
up
jack
occasionally
gave
us
a
song
or
two
from
the
repertory
already
described
and
steward
did
not
forget
the
but
through
the
hardest
part
of
cataract
canyon
we
were
usually
tired
enough
to
take
to
our
blankets
early
in
the
morning
we
began
the
day
by
running
a
little
rapid
between
our
camp
and
the
big
one
that
we
saw
from
there
and
then
we
had
to
exert
some
careful
engineering
to
pass
below
by
means
of
the
lines
this
accomplished
we
found
a
repetition
of
the
same
kind
of
work
necessary
almost
immediately
at
the
next
rapid
in
places
we
had
to
lift
the
boats
out
and
slide
them
along
on
driftwood
skids
these
rapids
were
largely
formed
by
enormous
rocks
which
had
fallen
from
the
cliffs
and
over
around
and
between
these
it
was
necessary
to
manoeuvre
the
boats
by
lines
to
avoid
the
furious
waters
of
the
outer
river
after
dinner
we
arrived
at
a
descent
which
at
first
glance
seemed
as
bad
as
anything
we
had
met
in
the
morning
but
an
examination
showed
a
prospect
of
a
successful
run
through
it
the
fall
was
nearly
twenty
feet
in
about
as
many
yards
the
major
and
examined
it
long
and
carefully
a
successful
run
would
take
two
minutes
while
a
would
occupy
us
for
at
least
two
hours
and
it
had
some
difficult
points
they
hesitated
about
running
the
place
for
they
would
not
take
a
risk
that
was
not
necessary
but
finally
they
concluded
it
could
be
safely
accomplished
and
we
pulled
the
as
quickly
as
possible
into
the
middle
of
the
river
and
swung
down
into
it
on
both
sides
the
water
was
hammered
to
foam
amidst
great
boulders
and
the
roar
as
usual
was
deafening
just
through
the
centre
was
a
clean
clear
chute
followed
by
a
long
tail
of
waves
breaking
and
snapping
like
some
demon
jaws
as
we
struck
into
them
they
swept
over
us
like
combers
on
the
beach
in
a
great
storm
it
seemed
to
me
here
and
at
other
similar
places
that
we
went
through
some
of
the
waves
like
a
needle
and
jumped
to
the
top
of
others
to
balance
out
of
water
for
an
instant
before
diving
to
another
trough
being
in
the
very
bow
the
waves
it
appeared
to
me
sometimes
completely
submerged
me
and
almost
took
my
breath
away
with
the
sudden
impact
at
any
rate
it
was
lively
work
with
a
current
of
fifteen
or
eighteen
miles
an
hour
beaman
had
stationed
himself
where
he
could
get
a
negative
of
us
ploughing
through
these
breakers
but
his
were
too
slow
and
he
had
no
success
after
this
came
a
place
which
permitted
no
such
jaunty
treatment
it
was
in
fact
three
or
four
rapids
following
each
other
so
closely
that
though
some
might
be
successfully
run
the
last
was
not
safe
and
no
landing
could
be
made
at
its
head
so
a
very
long
was
obligatory
but
it
was
an
easy
one
for
each
crew
could
take
its
own
boat
down
without
help
from
the
others
then
tired
wet
and
cold
as
usual
we
landed
on
the
left
in
a
little
cove
where
there
was
a
sandy
beach
for
our
camp
we
had
made
less
than
four
miles
in
which
distance
there
were
six
rapids
only
two
of
which
we
ran
at
another
stage
of
water
the
number
and
character
of
these
rapids
would
be
changed
some
would
be
easier
at
higher
water
some
harder
and
the
same
would
be
true
of
lower
water
rapids
also
change
their
character
from
time
to
time
as
rocks
are
shifted
along
the
bottom
and
more
rocks
fall
from
the
cliffs
or
are
brought
in
by
side
floods
the
walls
were
now
about
two
thousand
feet
of
limestone
with
a
reddish
stain
and
they
were
so
near
together
that
the
sun
shone
to
the
bottom
only
during
the
middle
hours
of
the
day
in
september
it
was
now
september
a
bright
and
beautiful
sunday
broke
the
sky
above
clear
and
tranquil
the
river
below
foaming
and
fuming
between
the
ragged
walls
in
one
continuous
rapid
with
merely
variations
of
descent
in
three
quarters
of
a
mile
we
arrived
before
the
greatest
portion
of
the
declivity
where
though
there
seemed
to
be
a
clear
chute
we
did
not
consider
it
advisable
to
make
the
run
because
of
conditions
following
neither
could
we
make
a
regular
or
a
portage
the
least
risky
method
was
to
carry
a
line
down
and
when
all
was
ready
start
the
boat
in
at
the
top
alone
in
this
way
when
she
had
gone
through
the
men
on
the
line
below
were
able
to
bring
her
up
and
haul
her
in
before
reaching
the
next
bad
plunge
there
was
no
quiet
river
anywhere
nothing
but
rushing
swirling
plunging
water
and
rocks
we
got
past
the
bad
spot
successfully
and
went
on
making
one
after
another
for
about
four
miles
when
we
halted
at
noon
for
the
rest
of
the
day
well
satisfied
with
our
progress
though
in
distance
it
appeared
so
slight
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
repairing
boats
working
up
notes
and
taking
observations
the
cliffs
were
now
some
feet
in
height
ragged
and
broken
on
their
faces
but
close
together
the
narrowest
deep
chasm
we
had
seen
it
was
truly
a
terrible
place
with
the
fierce
river
the
giant
walls
and
the
separation
from
any
known
path
to
the
outer
world
i
thought
of
the
major
first
trip
when
it
was
not
known
what
kind
of
waters
were
here
vertical
and
impassable
falls
might
easily
have
barred
his
way
and
cataracts
behind
prevented
return
so
that
here
in
a
death
trap
they
would
have
been
compelled
to
plunge
into
the
river
or
wait
for
starvation
happly
he
had
encountered
no
such
conditions
an
interesting
feature
of
this
canyon
was
the
manner
in
which
huge
masses
of
rock
lying
in
the
river
had
been
ground
into
each
other
by
the
force
of
the
current
one
block
of
sandstone
weighing
not
less
than
six
hundred
tons
being
thirty
or
forty
feet
long
by
twenty
feet
square
had
been
oscillated
till
the
limestone
boulders
on
which
it
rested
had
ground
into
it
at
least
two
feet
fitting
closely
another
enormous
piece
was
slowly
and
regularly
rocking
as
the
furious
current
beat
upon
it
and
one
could
feel
the
movement
distinctly
a
good
night
sleep
made
all
of
us
fresh
again
and
we
began
the
monday
early
some
worked
on
the
boats
while
beaman
and
clem
went
up
gypsum
canyon
as
steward
named
it
for
views
and
the
major
and
i
climbed
out
for
topographic
observations
we
reached
an
altitude
above
camp
of
feet
at
a
point
seven
or
eight
miles
back
from
the
brink
the
view
in
all
directions
was
beyond
words
to
describe
mountains
and
mountains
canyons
cliffs
pinnacles
buttes
surrounded
us
as
far
as
we
could
see
and
the
range
was
extensive
the
sierra
la
sal
the
sierra
abajo
and
other
short
ranges
lay
blue
in
the
distance
while
comparatively
near
in
the
rose
the
five
beautiful
peaks
just
beyond
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
composing
the
unknown
range
before
mentioned
at
noon
we
made
coffee
had
lunch
and
then
went
on
it
was
four
by
the
time
we
concluded
to
start
back
and
darkness
overtook
us
before
we
were
fairly
down
the
cliffs
but
there
was
a
bright
moon
and
by
its
aid
we
reached
camp
at
eight
in
the
morning
of
september
we
were
again
working
our
way
down
the
torrential
river
anybody
who
tries
to
go
through
here
in
any
haphazard
fashion
will
surely
come
to
grief
it
is
a
passage
that
can
safely
be
made
only
with
the
most
extreme
caution
the
walls
grew
straighter
and
they
grew
higher
till
the
gorge
assumed
proportions
that
seemed
to
me
the
acme
of
the
stupendous
and
magnificent
the
scenery
may
not
have
been
beautiful
in
the
sense
that
an
alpine
lake
is
beautiful
but
in
the
exhibition
of
the
power
and
majesty
of
nature
it
was
sublime
there
was
the
same
general
barrenness
only
a
few
hackberry
trees
willows
and
a
cottonwood
or
two
along
the
margin
of
the
river
made
up
the
vegetation
our
first
task
was
a
difficult
which
we
accomplished
safely
to
find
that
we
could
run
two
rapids
following
it
and
half
of
another
landing
then
to
complete
it
by
a
then
came
a
very
sharp
drop
that
we
ran
which
put
us
before
another
easy
one
that
was
followed
by
a
difficult
bit
of
navigation
through
a
bad
descent
after
which
we
stopped
for
dinner
on
the
right
at
the
head
of
another
rapid
the
cliffs
now
on
both
sides
were
about
feet
one
quarter
mile
wide
at
top
and
in
places
striking
me
as
being
perpendicular
especially
in
the
outer
curve
of
the
bends
the
boats
seemed
to
be
scarcely
more
than
chips
on
the
sweeping
current
and
we
not
worth
mentioning
during
the
afternoon
we
halted
a
number
of
times
for
beaman
to
make
photographs
but
the
proportions
were
almost
too
great
for
any
camera
the
foreground
parts
are
always
magnified
while
the
distances
are
diminished
till
the
view
is
not
that
which
the
eye
perceives
before
stopping
for
the
night
we
ran
three
more
rapids
and
camped
on
the
right
on
a
sandbank
at
the
head
of
another
forbidding
place
the
record
for
the
whole
day
was
six
and
three
quarter
miles
with
ten
runs
and
two
at
one
bad
place
the
got
too
far
over
and
laboured
so
heavily
in
the
enormous
billows
that
who
pulled
the
bow
oars
was
completely
lost
to
sight
and
the
boat
was
filled
with
water
only
about
thirty
degrees
of
sky
were
visible
as
one
looked
directly
up
from
our
camp
a
pretty
canyon
came
in
near
camp
and
some
of
us
took
a
walk
up
its
narrow
way
illustration
cataract
canyon
photograph
by
beaman
in
the
morning
beaman
made
some
pictures
and
it
was
eleven
before
we
resumed
our
navigation
our
first
work
was
a
which
took
an
hour
and
about
a
mile
below
we
stopped
for
dinner
on
the
left
then
we
continued
making
eight
miles
more
in
which
distance
we
ran
six
rapids
and
made
two
the
last
rapid
was
a
bad
one
and
there
we
made
one
of
the
portages
camping
at
its
foot
on
the
left
bank
the
walls
began
to
diminish
in
height
and
the
river
was
less
precipitous
as
is
apparent
from
the
progress
we
were
able
to
make
september
we
began
by
running
two
rapids
immediately
below
camp
and
the
remained
at
the
foot
of
the
second
to
signal
beaman
in
the
as
he
had
stayed
behind
to
take
some
views
another
mile
brought
us
to
a
rather
bad
place
the
right
having
a
vertical
cliff
about
feet
high
but
the
left
was
composed
of
boulders
spread
over
a
wide
stretch
so
that
an
excellent
footing
was
offered
the
major
and
concluded
to
climb
out
here
instead
of
a
point
farther
down
called
millecrag
bend
and
appointing
steward
master
of
the
which
was
necessary
they
left
us
it
was
when
we
got
the
boats
below
to
a
safe
cove
and
we
were
quite
ready
for
the
meal
which
andy
meanwhile
had
been
cooking
a
beautiful
little
brook
came
down
a
narrow
canyon
on
the
left
and
it
was
up
this
stream
that
the
major
went
for
a
mile
and
a
half
and
then
climbed
on
the
side
they
were
obliged
to
give
it
up
and
come
back
to
the
bottom
by
this
time
it
was
too
late
to
make
another
attempt
so
they
turned
their
backs
on
failure
creek
and
returning
to
us
said
we
would
go
on
as
soon
as
we
had
eaten
the
supper
which
andy
was
preparing
they
would
climb
out
at
millecrag
bend
andy
had
cooked
a
mess
of
beans
about
the
last
we
had
and
what
we
did
not
eat
we
put
on
board
in
the
kettle
which
had
a
tight
cover
the
major
manner
for
a
day
or
two
had
been
rather
moody
and
when
intimated
to
me
that
we
would
have
a
lively
time
before
we
saw
another
camp
i
knew
some
difficult
passage
ahead
was
on
his
mind
some
place
which
had
given
him
trouble
on
the
first
trip
about
five
we
were
ready
everything
was
made
snug
and
tight
on
the
boats
nothing
being
left
out
of
the
cabins
but
a
camp
kettle
in
each
for
bailing
and
we
cast
off
each
man
had
his
where
he
could
get
it
quickly
and
the
major
put
his
on
for
with
only
one
arm
he
could
not
do
this
readily
in
case
of
necessity
the
current
was
swift
we
were
carried
rapidly
down
to
where
the
gorge
narrowed
up
with
walls
vertical
on
each
side
for
a
height
of
fifty
to
one
hundred
feet
we
soon
dashed
through
a
small
rough
rapid
a
splash
of
water
over
our
bow
dampened
my
clothes
and
made
the
air
feel
chilly
the
canyon
was
growing
dim
with
the
evening
light
high
above
our
heads
some
lazy
clouds
were
flecked
with
the
sunset
glow
not
far
below
the
small
rapid
we
saw
before
us
a
complicated
situation
at
the
prevailing
stage
of
water
and
immediately
landed
on
the
left
where
there
was
footing
to
reconnoitre
a
considerable
fall
was
divided
by
a
rocky
island
a
low
mass
that
would
be
submerged
with
two
or
three
feet
more
water
and
the
river
plunging
down
on
each
side
boiled
against
the
cliffs
between
us
and
the
island
the
stream
was
studded
by
immense
boulders
which
had
dropped
from
the
cliffs
and
almost
like
pinnacles
stood
above
the
surface
one
view
was
enough
to
show
that
on
this
stage
of
water
we
could
not
safely
run
either
side
of
the
cataract
indeed
destruction
would
surely
have
rewarded
any
attempt
the
channel
from
the
foot
of
the
island
swept
powerfully
across
to
meet
the
one
and
together
they
boomed
along
the
base
of
the
cliffs
before
swinging
sharply
to
the
right
with
the
trend
of
the
chasm
in
that
direction
there
was
no
choice
of
a
course
the
only
way
was
to
manoeuvre
between
the
great
boulders
and
keep
in
the
dividing
line
of
the
current
till
a
landing
could
be
effected
on
the
head
of
the
island
between
the
two
falls
the
difficulty
was
to
avoid
being
drawn
to
either
side
our
boat
went
first
and
we
succeeded
under
the
major
quick
eye
and
fine
judgment
in
easily
following
the
proposed
course
till
the
began
to
bump
on
the
rocks
some
twenty
yards
above
the
exposed
part
of
the
island
i
tested
the
depth
of
water
here
with
an
oar
as
jack
pulled
slowly
along
the
current
being
quite
slack
in
the
dividing
line
and
as
soon
as
practicable
we
jumped
overboard
and
guided
our
craft
safely
to
the
island
in
the
was
equally
precise
and
as
he
came
in
we
waded
out
to
catch
his
boat
but
the
passed
on
the
wrong
side
of
one
of
the
pinnacles
and
caught
in
the
left
current
came
near
making
a
run
of
it
down
that
side
which
would
have
resulted
disastrously
luckily
they
were
able
to
extricate
themselves
and
beaman
steered
in
to
us
had
the
water
been
only
high
enough
to
prevent
landing
on
this
island
we
would
have
been
in
a
bad
trap
but
had
it
been
so
high
as
to
make
navigation
down
the
centre
possible
the
rapid
might
perhaps
have
been
run
safely
we
were
now
on
the
island
with
darkness
falling
and
the
problem
was
to
get
off
while
and
the
major
went
down
to
the
foot
to
make
a
plan
we
sat
in
the
diminishing
light
and
waited
it
was
decided
to
pull
the
boats
down
the
side
of
the
island
as
far
as
the
foot
of
the
worst
part
of
the
rapid
and
from
there
cut
out
into
the
tail
of
waves
pulling
through
as
quickly
as
we
could
to
avoid
contact
with
the
base
of
the
left
wall
along
which
the
current
dashed
we
must
pull
fast
enough
to
get
across
in
the
very
short
time
it
would
take
the
river
to
sweep
us
down
to
the
crucial
point
the
gorge
by
this
time
was
quite
sombre
even
the
clouds
above
were
losing
their
evening
colour
we
must
act
quickly
our
boat
as
usual
made
the
first
trial
as
we
shot
out
jack
and
i
bent
to
our
oars
with
every
muscle
we
possessed
the
boat
headed
slightly
upstream
and
in
a
few
seconds
we
were
flying
along
the
base
of
the
cliffs
and
so
close
that
our
starboard
oars
had
to
be
quickly
unshipped
to
prevent
their
being
broken
in
a
few
seconds
more
we
were
able
to
get
out
into
the
middle
and
then
we
halted
in
an
eddy
to
wait
for
the
other
boats
they
came
on
successfully
and
in
the
gloaming
we
continued
down
the
canyon
looking
for
a
place
to
camp
our
hearts
much
lightened
with
our
triumph
over
the
difficult
rapid
before
long
night
was
full
upon
us
and
our
wet
clothes
made
us
shiver
about
a
mile
below
a
warning
roar
dead
ahead
told
us
to
make
land
at
once
for
it
would
be
far
from
prudent
to
attack
a
rapid
in
the
dark
fortunately
there
was
here
room
to
camp
on
some
rocks
and
sand
on
the
right
scarcely
had
we
become
settled
than
a
tornado
broke
over
the
canyon
and
we
were
enveloped
in
a
blinding
whirl
of
rain
and
sand
each
man
clung
to
his
blankets
to
prevent
their
departure
and
waited
for
the
wind
to
pass
which
it
did
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
were
shattered
and
up
the
gorge
directly
east
from
our
position
from
behind
a
thousand
spires
that
serrated
the
top
of
the
cliffs
the
moon
like
a
globe
of
dazzling
silver
rolled
up
with
serene
majesty
flooding
the
canyon
with
a
bright
radiance
no
could
have
been
more
dramatic
the
were
edged
with
light
and
the
wet
cliffs
sparkled
and
glittered
as
if
set
with
jewels
even
the
rapid
below
was
resplendent
and
silvery
the
leaping
waves
and
the
spray
scintillating
under
the
lustrous
glare
morning
brought
a
continuation
of
the
rain
which
fell
in
a
deluge
driving
us
to
the
shelter
of
a
projecting
ledge
from
which
comparatively
dry
retreat
we
watched
the
rain
cascades
that
soon
began
their
display
everywhere
they
came
plunging
over
the
walls
all
sizes
and
varying
their
volume
with
every
variation
in
the
downpour
some
dropped
a
thousand
feet
to
vanish
in
spray
others
were
broken
into
many
falls
by
eight
we
were
able
to
proceed
running
the
rapid
without
any
trouble
but
a
wave
drenched
me
so
that
all
my
efforts
to
keep
out
of
the
rain
went
for
nothing
by
ten
we
had
run
four
more
rapids
and
arrived
at
the
place
the
major
had
named
millecrag
bend
from
the
multitude
of
ragged
pinnacles
into
which
the
cliffs
broke
on
the
left
we
camped
to
permit
the
major
and
to
make
their
prospective
climb
to
the
top
a
large
canyon
entered
from
the
left
terminating
cataract
canyon
which
we
credited
with
miles
and
in
which
i
counted
rapids
and
cataracts
enough
to
give
any
set
of
boatmen
all
the
work
they
could
desire
the
major
and
reached
the
summit
at
an
altitude
of
fifteen
hundred
feet
they
had
a
wide
view
over
the
unknown
country
and
saw
mountains
to
the
west
with
snow
on
their
summits
snow
in
the
canyons
would
not
have
surprised
us
now
for
the
nights
were
cold
and
we
had
warmth
only
in
the
middle
of
the
day
near
our
camp
some
caves
were
discovered
twenty
feet
deep
and
nearly
six
feet
in
height
which
had
once
been
occupied
by
natives
walls
had
been
laid
across
the
entrances
and
inside
were
corncobs
and
other
evidences
usual
in
this
region
now
so
well
known
pottery
fragments
were
also
abundant
another
thing
we
found
in
the
caves
and
also
in
other
places
was
a
species
of
small
scorpion
these
venomous
creatures
were
always
ready
to
strike
and
somehow
one
got
into
shoe
and
when
he
put
on
the
shoe
he
was
bitten
no
serious
result
seemed
to
follow
but
his
general
health
was
not
so
good
after
this
for
a
long
time
he
put
tobacco
on
the
wound
and
let
it
go
this
was
the
second
accident
to
a
member
of
the
party
which
now
had
been
out
four
months

the
last
day
of

found
us
up
before
daylight
and
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
eaten
a
small
matter
these
days
both
in
preparation
and
consumption
we
pulled
away
intending
to
reach
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
as
soon
as
possible
the
morning
was
decidedly
autumnal
and
when
we
arrived
at
a
small
rapid
where
we
had
to
get
overboard
to
help
the
boats
nothing
ever
came
harder
than
this
cold
bath
though
it
was
confined
to
our
legs
presently
we
saw
a
clear
little
rivulet
coming
in
on
the
left
and
we
ran
up
to
that
shore
to
examine
it
hoping
it
was
drinkable
like
the
first
party
we
were
on
the
lookout
for
better
water
to
drink
than
the
muddy
colorado
the
rivulet
proved
to
be
sulphurous
and
also
hot
the
temperature
being
about
we
could
not
drink
it
but
we
warmed
our
feet
by
standing
in
the
water
the
walls
of
this
new
canyon
at
their
highest
were
about
thirteen
hundred
feet
and
so
close
together
and
straight
that
the
major
named
it
narrow
canyon
its
length
is
about
nine
miles
through
half
of
the
next
rapid
we
made
a
running
the
remainder
and
then
running
two
more
below
which
were
easy
we
could
see
through
to
the
end
of
the
canyon
and
the
picture
framed
by
the
precipices
was
beautiful
the
world
seemed
suddenly
to
open
out
before
us
and
in
the
middle
of
it
clear
and
strong
against
a
sky
of
azure
accented
by
the
daylight
moon
stood
the
unknown
mountains
weird
and
silent
in
their
untrodden
mystery
by
this
token
we
knew
that
the
river
of
the
satanic
name
was
near
and
we
had
scarcely
emerged
from
narrow
canyon
and
noted
the
low
bluffs
of
homogeneous
red
sandstone
which
took
the
place
of
the
high
cliffs
when
we
perceived
a
sluggish
stream
about
feet
wide
flowing
through
the
barren
sandstone
on
our
right
landing
on
its
west
bank
we
instantly
agreed
with
jack
sumner
when
on
the
first
trip
he
had
proclaimed
it
a
dirty
devil
muddy
alkaline
undrinkable

slipped
along

we

her
down

carried
her
back
about
two
hundred
feet
to
a
low
cliff
and
up
thirty
or
forty
feet
above
the
prevailing
stage
of
water

we
hid
her
under
an
enormous
mass
of
rock

had
so
fallen
from
the

as
to
lodge
against
the
wall
forming
a

all
of

had
been
left
at

we
filled

with

all
about

prevent

from
carrying
her
off

away

as

as
nine
only
had
arrived
the
major
and
jones
then
climbed
out
from
this
place
while
with
the
ran
down
about
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
mouth
of
a
gulch
on
the
right
where
he
and
the
major
had
traced
the
old
trail
the
rest
of
us
returned
to
camp
and
cap
climbed
out
after
following
the
trail
up
the
gulch
six
miles
and
they
saw
that
it
went
toward
the
unknown
mountains
which
now
lay
very
near
us
on
the
west
steward
got
out
by
an
attempt
not
so
far
up
the
canyon
and
reached
an
altitude
of
feet
where
he
had
a
clear
full
view
of
the
mountains
with
his
glass
he
was
able
to
study
their
formation
and
determined
that
lava
from
below
had
spread
out
between
the
sedimentary
strata
forming
what
he
called
blisters
he
could
see
where
one
side
of
a
blister
had
been
eroded
showing
the
surrounding
stratification
when
the
major
and
jones
came
back
we
put
the
cargo
of
the
on
the
and
all
of
us
embarked
seven
in
number
and
ran
down
to
where
the
was
moored
here
we
camped
for
the
night
the
crews
were
then
rearranged
beaman
being
assigned
to
my
bow
oars
clem
and
andy
going
in
the
while
i
was
to
sit
on
the
middle
cabin
of
the
in
front
of
the
major
where
i
could
carry
on
my
sketching
we
were
now
a
lot
for
our
clothes
had
been
almost
worn
off
our
bodies
in
the
rapids
our
shoes
notwithstanding
that
the
major
had
brought
us
a
fresh
supply
at
gunnison
crossing
were
about
gone
and
we
were
tanned
till
we
could
hardly
have
been
distinguished
from
the
old
shinumos
themselves
but
we
were
clean
steward
was
a
great
lover
of
burns
and
could
quote
him
by
the
page
though
what
he
most
liked
to
repeat
just
now
was
o
wad
some
power
the
giftie
gie
us
to
see
oursels
as
others
see
us
i
think
the
to
the
would
have
been
appropriate
for
this
particular
environment
but
i
do
not
remember
that
steward
quoted
hear
me
auld
hangie
for
a
wee
an
let
poor
damned
bodies
be
i
sure
sma
pleasure
it
can
gie
to
the
deil
to
skelp
an
scaud
poor
dogs
like
me
an
hear
us
squeel
the
cargo
of
the
was
distributed
among
the
cabins
of
the
and
the
and
cap
was
somewhat
disturbed
by
having
an
addition
to
the
bow
compartment
in
the
each
man
had
charge
of
a
cabin
and
this
was
cap
special
pride
he
daily
packed
it
so
methodically
that
it
became
a
standing
joke
with
us
and
we
often
asked
him
whether
he
always
placed
that
thermometer
back
of
the
fifth
rib
or
in
front
of
the
third
or
some
such
nonsensical
question
which
of
course
cap
took
in
good
part
and
only
arranged
his
cabin
still
more
carefully
the
next
morning
the
of
october
at
eight
we
continued
our
voyage
now
entering
a
new
canyon
then
called
mound
but
it
was
afterwards
consolidated
with
the
portion
below
called
monument
and
together
they
now
stand
as
glen
canyon
in
about
three
and
one
half
miles
we
ran
several
sharp
little
rapids
but
they
were
not
of
much
consequence
and
we
stopped
to
examine
a
house
ruin
we
saw
standing
up
boldly
on
a
cliff
on
the
left
it
could
be
seen
for
a
long
distance
in
both
directions
and
correspondingly
its
inmates
in
the
old
days
could
see
every
approach
doubtless
the
trail
we
had
seen
on
the
right
had
its
exit
on
the
other
side
near
it
the
walls
neatly
built
of
thin
sandstone
slabs
still
stood
about
fifteen
feet
high
and
fifteen
inches
thick
the
dimensions
on
the
ground
were
feet
outside
it
had
been
of
two
or
three
stories
and
exhibited
considerable
skill
on
the
part
of
the
builders
the
corners
being
plumb
and
square
under
the
brink
of
the
cliff
was
a
sort
of
gallery
formed
by
the
erosion
of
a
soft
shale
between
heavy
sandstone
beds
forming
a
floor
and
roof
about
eight
or
ten
feet
wide
separated
by
six
or
seven
feet
in
vertical
height
a
wall
had
been
carried
along
the
outer
edge
and
the
space
thus
made
was
divided
by
cross
walls
into
a
number
of
rooms
potsherds
and
mostly
broken
ones
were
strewn
everywhere
there
were
also
numerous
of
which
i
made
copies
as
we
pulled
on
and
on
the
major
frequently
recited
selections
from
the
poets
and
one
that
he
seemed
to
like
very
much
and
said
sometimes
half
in
reverie
was
longfellow
often
i
think
of
the
beautiful
town
that
is
seated
by
the
sea
often
in
thought
go
up
and
down
the
pleasant
streets
of
that
dear
old
town
and
my
youth
comes
back
to
me
and
a
verse
of
a
lapland
song
is
haunting
my
memory
still
boy
will
is
the
wind
will
and
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
he
would
repeat
several
times
with
much
feeling
a
boy
will
is
the
wind
will
and
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
another
thing
he
enjoyed
repeating
was
whittier
old
floyd
ireson
for
his
hard
heart
tarred
and
feathered
and
carried
in
a
cart
by
the
women
of
marblehead
towards
evening
we
came
to
another
shinumo
ruin
where
we
made
camp
having
run
altogether
sixteen
miles
with
ten
rapids
all
small
between
walls
of
red
homogeneous
sandstone
averaging
about
one
thousand
feet
in
height
the
river
some
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
wide
was
low
causing
many
shoals
which
formed
the
small
rapids
we
often
had
to
wade
alongside
to
lighten
the
boats
but
otherwise
these
places
were
easy
a
trifle
more
water
would
have
done
away
with
them
or
at
least
would
have
enabled
us
to
ignore
them
completely
the
house
ruin
at
our
camp
was
very
old
and
broken
down
and
had
dimensions
of
about
feet
climbed
out
to
a
point
feet
above
the
river
where
he
saw
plainly
the
unknown
mountains
navajo
mountain
and
a
wide
sweep
of
country
formed
largely
of
barren
sandstone
steward
felt
considerably
under
the
weather
and
remained
as
quiet
as
possible
in
the
morning
we
were
quickly
on
the
water
pushing
along
under
conditions
similar
to
those
of
the
previous
day
making
miles
and
passing
eleven
very
small
rapids
with
a
river
four
hundred
feet
wide
and
the
same
walls
of
homogeneous
red
sandstone
about
one
thousand
feet
high
the
cliffs
in
the
bends
were
often
slightly
overhanging
that
is
the
brink
was
outside
of
a
perpendicular
line
but
the
opposite
side
would
then
generally
be
very
much
cut
down
usually
to
irregular
rounded
slopes
of
smooth
rock
the
vertical
portions
were
unbroken
by
cracks
or
crevices
or
ledges
being
extensive
flat
surfaces
beautifully
stained
by
iron
till
one
could
imagine
all
manner
of
tapestry
effects
along
the
river
there
were
large
patches
of
alluvial
soil
which
might
easily
be
irrigated
though
it
is
probable
that
at
certain
periods
they
would
be
rapidly
cut
to
pieces
by
high
water
again
climbed
out
at
our
noon
camp
and
saw
little
but
naked
orange
sandstone
in
rounded
hills
except
the
usual
mountains
in
the
barren
sandstone
he
found
many
pockets
or
a
feature
of
this
formation
often
thirty
or
forty
feet
deep
and
frequently
containing
water
wherever
we
climbed
out
in
this
region
we
saw
in
the
depressions
flat
beds
of
sand
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
small
round
balls
of
stone
an
inch
or
so
in
diameter
like
marbles
concretions
and
hard
fragments
which
had
been
driven
round
and
round
by
the
winds
till
they
were
quite
true
spheres
the
next
day
october
we
ran
into
a
stratum
of
sandstone
shale
which
at
this
low
stage
of
water
for
about
five
miles
gave
us
some
trouble
ledge
after
ledge
stretched
across
the
swift
river
which
at
the
same
time
spread
to
at
least
six
hundred
feet
sometimes
one
thousand
we
were
obliged
to
walk
in
the
water
alongside
for
great
distances
to
lighten
the
boats
and
ease
them
over
the
ridges
occasionally
the
rock
bottom
was
as
smooth
as
a
ballroom
floor
again
it
would
be
carved
in
the
direction
of
the
current
into
thousands
of
narrow
sharp
polished
ridges
from
three
to
twelve
inches
apart
upon
which
the
boats
pounded
badly
in
spite
of
all
exertions
to
prevent
it
the
water
was
alternately
shallow
and
ten
feet
deep
giving
us
all
we
could
do
to
protect
the
boats
and
at
the
same
time
avoid
sudden
duckings
in
deep
water
with
all
our
care
the
got
a
bad
knock
and
leaked
so
fast
that
one
man
continually
bailing
could
barely
keep
the
water
out
we
repaired
her
at
and
the
shales
running
up
above
the
river
we
escaped
further
annoyance
from
this
cause
even
with
this
interference
our
progress
was
fairly
good
and
by
we
had
made
miles
we
had
a
rapid
shallow
river
again
the
following
day
october
but
the
water
was
not
so
widely
spread
out
and
there
were
fewer
delays
the
walls
were
of
orange
sandstone
strangely
cut
up
by
narrow
side
canyons
some
not
more
than
twenty
feet
wide
and
twisting
back
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
where
they
expanded
into
huge
amphitheatres
domed
and
alcoves
filled
with
trees
and
shrubs
also
opened
from
the
river
and
numerous
springs
were
noted
along
the
cliffs
twelve
miles
below
our
camp
we
passed
a
stream
coming
in
on
the
left
through
a
canyon
about
one
thousand
feet
deep
similar
to
that
of
the
colorado
this
was
the
san
juan
now
shallow
and
some
eight
rods
wide
we
did
not
stop
till
noon
when
we
were
two
miles
below
it
near
one
of
the
amphitheatres
or
grottoes
to
which
the
first
party
had
given
the
name
of
music
temple
the
entrance
was
by
a
narrow
gorge
which
after
some
distance
widened
at
the
bottom
to
about
five
hundred
feet
in
diameter
leaving
the
upper
walls
arching
over
till
they
formed
a
cavern
about
two
hundred
feet
high
with
a
narrow
belt
of
sky
visible
above
in
the
farther
end
was
a
pool
of
clear
water
while
five
or
six
green
cottonwoods
and
some
bushes
marked
the
point
of
expansion
one
side
was
covered
with
bright
ferns
mosses
and
honeysuckle
every
whisper
or
cough
resounded
this
was
only
one
of
a
hundred
such
places
but
we
had
no
time
to
examine
them
on
a
smooth
space
of
rock
we
found
carved
by
themselves
the
names
of
seneca
howland
howland
and
william
dunn
the
three
men
of
the
first
party
who
were
killed
by
the
shewits
in
climbed
up
eight
hundred
feet
and
had
a
fine
view
of
navajo
mountain
which
was
now
very
near
we
then
chiefly
called
it
mount
seneca
howland
applied
by
the
major
in
memory
of
that
unfortunate
person
but
later
the
peak
already
having
to
some
extent
been
known
as
navajo
mountain
that
name
was
finally
adopted
no
one
had
ever
been
to
it
so
far
as
we
knew
and
the
major
was
desirous
of
reaching
the
summit
illustration
glen

photograph
by
beaman
leaving
the
music
temple
which
seemed
to
us
a
sort
of
mausoleum
to
the
three
men
who
had
marked
it
with
their
names
we
soon
arrived
at
a
pretty
rapid
with
a
clear
chute
it
was
not
large
but
it
was
the
only
real
one
we
had
seen
in
this
canyon
and
we
dashed
through
it
with
pleasure
just
below
we
halted
to
look
admiringly
up
at
navajo
mountain
which
now
loomed
beside
us
on
the
left
to
an
altitude
of
feet
above
sea
level
or
more
than
feet
above
our
position
as
was
later
determined
the
major
contemplated
stopping
long
enough
for
a
climb
to
the
top
but
on
appealing
to
andy
for
information
as
to
the
state
of
the
supplies
he
found
we
were
near
the
last
crust
and
he
decided
that
we
had
better
pull
on
as
steadily
as
possible
towards
el
vado
we
ran
down
a
considerable
distance
through
some
shallows
and
camped
on
the
left
having
accomplished
about
twenty
miles
in
the
day
towards
our
goal
here
the
remaining
food
was
divided
into
two
portions
one
for
supper
the
other
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
though
we
were
running
so
close
to
the
starvation
line
we
felt
no
great
concern
about
it
we
always
had
confidence
in
our
ability
somehow
to
get
through
with
success
andy
particularly
never
failed
in
his
optimism
generally
he
took
no
interest
in
the
nature
of
a
rapid
lying
half
asleep
while
the
others
examined
the
place
and
entirely
willing
to
run
anything
or
make
a
portage
or
even
swim
he
cared
not
nothing
ever
happens
to
any
outfit
i
belong
to
he
would
declare
shifting
to
an
easier
position
let
her
go
and
now
so
far
as
andy
attitude
was
concerned
we
might
have
possessed
unlimited
rations
jack
lightened
the
situation
yet
more
with
his
jolly
songs
and
humorous
expressions
and
no
one
viewing
that
camp
would
have
thought
the
ten
men
had
before
them
a
possibility
of
several
days
without
food
except
what
they
might
kill
in
the
barren
country
and
perhaps
a
walk
from
el
vado
over
an
unknown
trail
about
one
hundred
miles
out
to
kanab
in
the
morning
friday
october
we
got
away
as
quickly
as
we
could
and
pulled
down
the
river
hoping
that
el
vado
was
not
far
ahead
and
feeling
somewhat
as
escalante
must
have
felt
a
century
before
when
he
was
trying
to
find
it
he
had
the
advantage
of
having
horses
which
could
be
eaten
from
time
to
time
of
course
we
knew
from
the
position
of
the
san
juan
and
of
navajo
mountain
that
we
could
reach
el
vado
in
at
most
two
days
but
the
question
was
would
we
find
any
one
there
with
rations
the
major
apparently
was
unconcerned
he
told
me
a
story
about
a
farmer
son
in
his
neighbourhood
when
himself
a
boy
who
had
no
shoes
no
good
clothes
no
decent
hat
but
who
went
to
the
father
and
declared
he
wanted
a
buzzum
pin
and
nothing
but
a
buzzum
pin
would
he
have
though
his
parent
called
his
attention
to
his
lack
of
other
necessaries
one
after
the
other
no
pa
the
boy
would
repeat
i
want
a
buzzum
pin

almost
vertical

ran
from

to

thousand
feet
in
height
cut
by
many
very
narrow
side
canyons
opening
into
large
glens
or
alcoves
on
and
on
we
steadily
pulled
till
noon
making
miles
when
we
stopped
on
the
right
on
a
sandstone
ledge
against
a
high
cliff
andy
had
a
few
scraps
left
among
them
a
bit
of
bacon
which
jack
enterprisingly
used
for
baiting
a
hook
and
soon
drew
out
several
small
fish
so
that
after
all
we
had
quite
a
dinner
the
walls
became
more
broken
as
we
went
on
apparently
with
numerous
opportunities
for
entrance
from
the
back
country
though
the
sandstone
even
where
not
very
steep
was
so
smooth
that
descent
over
it
would
be
difficult
we
had
gone
about
three
miles
after
dinner
when
we
saw
a
burned
place
in
the
brush
on
the
right
where
there
was
quite
a
large
piece
of
bottom
land
we
thought
this
might
be
some
signal
for
us
but
we
found
there
only
the
tracks
of
two
men
and
horses
all
well
shod
proving
that
they
were
not
natives
about
three
miles
farther
down
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
stick
with
a
white
rag
dangling
from
it
stuck
out
from
the
right
bank
and
at
the
same
moment
heard
a
shot
on
landing
and
mounting
the
bank
we
found
captain
pardyn
dodds
and
two
prospectors
george
riley
and
john
bonnemort
encamped
beside
a
large
pile
of

dodds
was
one
of
the
men
with
old
jacob
who
had
tried
desperately
to
reach
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
with
our
supplies
he
thought
he
had
arrived
at
a
point
where
he
could
see
it
and
went
back
to
inform
jacob
when
they
received
an
order
from
the
major
to
come
to
this
place
el
vado
de
los
padres
by
september
and
here
he
was
jacob
had
come
with
him
but
had
gone
on
to
fort
defiance
the
navajo
agency
to
settle
some
indian
business
leaving
him
to
guard
the
rations
having
left
kanab
early
in
september
they
had
no
late
news
they
had
become
discouraged
by
our
and
concluded
that
we
would
never
be
heard
from
again
consequently
they
had
planned
to
cache
the
rations
and
leave
for
the
settlement
on
sunday
that
night
andy
was
able
to
summon
us
to
go
fur
the
first
square
meal
we
had
eaten
for
nearly
a
month
there
was
among
the
supplies
some
plug
tobacco
which
we
cut
up
all
but
steward
and
cap
who
did
not
smoke
and
rolled
in
cigarettes
with
thick
yellow
paper
the
only
kind
we
had
having
learned
to
make
them
spanish
fashion
from
the
hamblins
and
we
smoked
around
the
fire
talking
to
dodds
and
the
prospectors
over
the
general
news
they
told
us
they
had
found
small
quantities
of
gold
along
the
river
a
great
many
papers
magazines
and
letters
for
everybody
were
in
the
packs
supplying
us
with
reading
matter
enough
for
weeks
though
the
papers
were
of
ancient
dates
they
were
new
to
us
the
whole
next
day
was
consumed
in
preparing
maps
notes
specimens
fossils
to
be
sent
by
to
the
settlement
of
kanab
one
hundred
miles
off
whither
the
major
himself
had
decided
to
start
with
the
outfit
the
next
morning
and
go
from
there
to
salt
lake
city
about
miles
north
none
of
us
had
a
chance
to
write
even
a
line
to
expectant
relatives
far
away
and
we
were
naturally
disappointed
till
persuaded
the
major
to
hold
over
till
tuesday
which
he
willingly
did
when
he
realised
the
situation
we
wrote
late
by
the
light
of
a
diminutive
fire
wood
being
scarce
he
then
left
us
on
october
with
jack
captain
dodds
and
the
miners
who
had
waited
only
to
learn
something
about
the
river
above
as
a
place
for
prospecting
the
trail
up
over
the
barren
sandstone
was
so
steep
and
smooth
that
two
of
the
lost
their
footing
and
rolled
back
to
the
bottom
but
received
no
injury
except
scraping
the
skin
off
their
knees
not
the
least
welcome
articles
among
the
supplies
were
a
pair
of
good
heavy
shoes
and
a
pair
of
strong
overalls
which
the
foresight
of
the
major
had
secured
for
each
one
of
us
our
clothing
as
before
mentioned
having
been
completely
worn
out
my
watch
which
i
had
carried
all
the
way
in
a
little
rubber
pocket
sewed
to
my
shirt
near
the
neck
where
it
seldom
got
wet
enough
to
stop
it
though
occasionally
it
refused
to
go
till
i
punched
it
up
with
a
large
pin
kept
for
the
purpose
which
my
wicked
companions
called
my
starting
bar
at
last
had
stopped
permanently
and
i
sent
it
out
by
jack
for
repairs
after
they
had
gone
we
settled
down
again
to
our
accustomed
labours
we
were
to
run
down
miles
farther
to
the
mouth
of
the
paria
whence
there
was
another
known
trail
to
the
settlement
and
cache
the
boats
the
was
to
come
back
to
us
there
with
additional
supplies
and
horses
and
take
us
out
to
kanab
where
we
were
to
make
headquarters
for
our
winter
explorations
in
the
practically
unknown
grand
canyon
region
as
well
as
in
that
to
the
eastward
during
this
interval
we
expected
to
discover
some
point
between
the
paria
and
diamond
creek
where
rations
could
be
brought
in
to
us
while
working
through
the
grand
canyon
the
next
season
we
did
not
then
know
that
the
winter
is
the
safest
and
best
time
for
making
the
passage
through
that
wonderful
gorge
our
appetites
were
now
enormous
and
as
we
could
eat
all
we
wanted
the
supplies
diminished
in
an
astonishing
way
but
as
we
were
soon
to
receive
more
we
did
not
care
every
man
braced
up
all
but
steward
who
felt
quite
sick
jones
began
to
feel
trouble
brewing
in
the
leg
which
he
had
hurt
at
the
junction
andy
showed
the
effects
of
the
scorpion
bite
by
becoming
thin
and
pale
thinner
than
our
previous
lack
of
rations
justified
who
had
been
shot
in
the
civil
war
through
and
through
near
the
heart
now
felt
the
effects
of
the
long
exposure
and
neither
clem
nor
beaman
considered
their
health
perfect
altogether
however
we
had
come
through
very
well
our
worst
work
was
over
for
this
year
and
the
maladies
portending
seemed
not
dangerous
desiring
to
get
some
notes
from
up
the
river
went
on
the
with
beaman
and
clem
back
six
miles
in
the
to
the
foot
of
some
rapid
water
they
could
not
pass
arriving
there
about
twelve
they
spent
all
afternoon
going
up
numerous
gulches
trying
to
find
a
way
out
as
there
was
a
large
area
of
bottom
land
with
old
and
much
broken
pottery
they
were
sure
there
was
a
path
but
it
was
late
before
they
discovered
a
place
where
modern
natives
had
piled
brush
and
stones
to
make
a
horse
trail
and
another
where
the
old
shinumos
for
fifty
feet
had
cut
steps
in
the
smooth
rock
the
party
followed
the
shinumo
trail
finding
the
steps
in
places
almost
worn
out
by
time
in
others
still
quite
good
and
large
enough
to
get
the
toe
of
a
shoe
in
by
the
time
they
came
to
the
top
it
was
too
late
for
observations
and
they
returned
to
the
river
for
camp
making
the
same
climb
by
the
steps
the
next
day
and
securing
the
observations
they
got
back
to
our
camp
late
in
the
afternoon
meanwhile
steward
illness
had
increased
and
i
spent
much
of
the
night
trying
to
relieve
his
pain
the
air
was
cold
and
he
was
most
uncomfortable
the
only
shelter
being
a
wickiup
of
boughs
we
had
built
to
protect
him
from
the
sun
we
had
opium
pills
in
our
medicine
chest
and
i
had
the
little
flask
of
brandy
referred
to
with
several
of
the
pills
and
my
brandy
which
i
at
last
persuaded
him
to
take
as
medicine
he
despised
alcoholic
drinks
his
suffering
was
somewhat
relieved
and
he
was
able
to
lie
still
on
his
bed
of
willows
during
the
next
day
his
condition
was
no
better
and
returning
was
much
distressed
by
it
by
drawing
further
on
the
medicine
chest
which
contained
numerous
remedies
he
was
able
to
relieve
him
a
little
more
the
exposure
had
brought
on
a
trouble
of
the
back
which
had
originally
developed
during
the
campaigns
of
the
civil
war

some
observations
from
the
heights
and
he
and

tried
to
climb
the
cliffs
but
failed
they
then
took
a
hammer
and
chisel
and
by
cutting
holds
in
the
sandstone
after
the
manner
of
the
old
shinumos
they
got
up
feet
and
secured
the
bearings
desired
the
following
day
they
went
out
on
the
trail
toward
kanab
five
miles
trying
to
find
another
point
of
exit
to
the
summit
but
did
not
succeed
while
they
were
gone
we
heard
a
sudden
shout
and
saw
an
indian
standing
on
the
rocks
not
far
away
we
beckoned
for
him
to
come
and
thereupon
he
fell
back
to
another
and
together
they
approached
we
saw
by
their
dress
so
different
from
the
ute
red
turbans
loose
unbleached
cotton
shirts
native
woven
sashes
at
the
waist
wide
unbleached
cotton

to

little
below
the
knee
and
there
slashed
up
on
the
outer
side
for
seven
or
eight
inches
bright
woven
garters
twisted
around
their
red
buckskin
leggins
below
the
knee
and
red
moccasins
with
turned
up
soles
and
silver
buttons
that
they
were
navajos
they
indicated
that
they
were

and
son
the
father
announcing
himself
in
a
lordly
way
as
agua
grande
he
was
over
six
feet
tall
and
apparently
sixty
or
seventy
years
old
the
son
was
a
fine
young
lad
of
about
fifteen
their
bearing
was
cordial
yet
proud
and
dignified
they
had
not
long
been
with
us
when
came
in
and
during
the
next
hour
seven
more
navajos
arrived
all
dressed
very
much
as
the
first
ones
were
they
expressed
great
friendliness
by
embracing
us
after
their
custom
and
delivering
long
speeches
of
which
we
understood
not
a
word
one
had
a
short
black
mustache
which
came
straight
out
sidewise
and
then
turned
at
right
angles
down
past
the
corners
of
his
mouth
i
never
had
heard
of
an
indian
with
a
mustache
before
they
had
no
visible
firearms
being
armed
with
strong
bows
and
quivers
full
of
arrows
old
agua
grande
became
much
interested
in
our
sick
man
and
made
signs
by
placing
two
spread
fingers
of
one
hand
inverted
upon
one
finger
held
horizontally
of
the
other
hand
and
moving
them
to
indicate
that
he
ought
to
ride
out
to
the
mormon
settlement
whither
they
were
bound
and
that
they
would
take
him
along
as
the
chief
had
exhibited
a
document
signed
by
the
agent
at
fort
defiance
to
the
effect
that
he
and
his
band
were
peaceable
and
going
on
a
trading
expedition
to
the
mormon
settlements
we
felt
certain
they
would
take
good
care
of
the
invalid
but
steward
said
he
preferred
to
remain
with
us
we
now
had
no
further
work
for
this
immediate
locality
and
concluded
to
run
down
a
mile
or
so
to
separate
ourselves
from
the
navajos
one
having
disclosed
a
tendency
to
surreptitiously
appropriate
small
articles
belonging
to
us
a
bed
was
made
on
the
middle
deck
of
one
of
the
boats
for
steward
and
when
all
was
ready
we
carried
him
down
to
it
the
navajos
ranged
themselves
along
the
bank
to
see
us
off
and
clem
with
his
customary
urbanity
went
down
the
line
all
smiles
shaking
each
one
cordially
by
the
hand
and
requesting
him
to
give
my
love
to
all
the
folks
at
home
and
remember
me
please
to
eliza
jane
and
similar
expressions
the
navajos
did
not
understand
the
words
but
being
themselves
great
jokers
they
saw
that
it
was
fun
and
they
all
laughed
making
remarks
which
doubtless
were
of
the
same
kind

below

by
which
these

sometimes
called

the
necessary
route
was
indicated
by
a
line
of
small
piles
of
stones
showing
above
water
it
was
not
an
easy
crossing
feasible
only
at
low
water
and
quite
impossible

even
had
there
been
a

for
centuries
has
been
known
to
all
the
tribes
of
the
region
about
three
miles
below
our
last
camp
we
landed
on
the
left
on
a
very
pretty
piece
of
bottom
land
inaccessible
except
by
river
being
bounded
behind
by
a
high
vertical
unscalable
wall
here
we
made
camp
with
plenty
of
food
water
and
wood
and
all
were
comfortable
by
a
fine
fire
all
but
steward
who
feeling
very
sick
was
lying
on
the
bed
we
had
prepared
for
him
he
had
another
bad
night
but
after
this
his
condition
seemed
gradually
to
improve

a

would

half

in

he
went
with

across

climbed
out
while
the
rest
of
us
did
nothing
but
lie
around

doing
what
was
possible
to
make
steward
comfortable
it
was
sunday
as
well
and
whenever
practicable
we
rested
the
whole
or
part
of
that

monday
we
started
late
and
ran
only
a
short
distance
before
dinner
which
we
ate
on
the
right
steward
still
was
unable
to
sit
up
and
he
was
carried
on
the
middle
deck
of
the
where
he
had
a
rope
to
cling
to
so
that
he
should
not
roll
off
into
the
water
when
the
boat
lurched
toward
evening
we
camped
at
the
head
of
a
small
rapid
near
a
fine
little
stream
coming
in
from
the
left
which
we
named

the

was
about
four
hundred
feet
wide
with

on
each
side

and
i
climbed
out
for
bearings
reaching
an
altitude
a
mile
or
so
back
from
the
river
of
feet
everywhere
we
discovered
broken
pottery
fragments
of
and
other
evidences
of
former
shinumo
occupancy
even
granting
only
a
few
persons
at
each
possible
locality
the
canyons
of
the
colorado
and
green
must
have
been
the
former
home
of
a
rather
large
population
in
the
afternoon
we
ran
the
little
rapid
and
kept
on
for
about
six
miles
making
twenty
in
all
from
el
vado
when
we
camped
on
a
heavy
talus
on
the
left
the
following
morning
october
we
had
not
gone
more
than
a
mile
when
we
came
to
a
singular
freak
of
erosion
a
lone
sandstone
pinnacle
on
the
right
three
hundred
or
four
hundred
feet
high
the
river
running
on
one
side
and
a
beautiful
creek
eight
feet
wide
on
the
other
we
named
these
sentinel
rock
and
sentinel
creek
and
camped
there
for
beaman
to
get
some
photographs
and
i
went
up
the
creek
and
tried
to
climb
out
for
observations
but
though
we
made
three
separate
attempts
we
had
to
give
it
up
steward
grew
so
much
better
that
he
was
able
to
walk
a
little
but
now
jones
began
to
feel
more
pain
in
his
injured
leg
on
thursday
the
we
made
nearly
seven
miles
between
walls
about
eight
hundred
feet
high
and
one
quarter
of
a
mile
apart
so
nearly
vertical
that
we
could
not
get
out
the
next
day
we
ran
six
miles
more
with
walls
one
thousand
feet
high
camping
at
a
place
where
there
was
a
wide
bottom
with
many
signs
of
old
native
camps
probably
navajo
in
the
morning
and
i
climbed
a
steep
slope
of
bright
orange
sand
a
little
below
our
camp
a
rather
hard
task
as
the
sand
was
loose
causing
us
to
slip
backward
at
every
step
after
twelve
hundred
or
fifteen
hundred
feet
of
this
kind
of
climbing
we
reached
the
base
of
three
rocky
peaks
several
hundred
feet
higher
we
had
considerable
difficulty
in
surmounting
one
of
these
being
forced
around
to
the
opposite
side
where
there
was
a
sheer
descent
from
our
position
of
some
fifteen
hundred
feet
with
sharp
black
rocks
at
the
bottom
where
any
one
slipping
would
fall
there
were
some
narrow
transverse
crevices
in
the
rock
by
means
of
which
we
got
up
one
man
having
been
pushed
aloft
from
the
solid
ledge
by
the
two
below
would
lie
back
against
the
slope
brace
himself
with
one
heel
in
a
transverse
fissure
and
lower
the
free
foot
as
a
handhold
for
the
others
to
mount
by
the
next
trouble
was
a
crevice
wide
enough
for
us
to
pass
through
to
the
top
but
holding
exactly
midway
a
large
rock
lodged
in
such
a
manner
that
we
could
not
crawl
under
and
yet
seeming
in
danger
of
rolling
down
if
we
went
over
it
it
was
precarious
not
only
for
the
man
ahead
who
tried
to
pass
but
for
those
below
waiting
for
results
but
it
was
more
firmly
wedged
than
it
appeared
to
be
and
each
one
in
turn
climbed
over
it
emerging
from
this
crack
we
were
on
the
summit
feet
above
the
river
and
above
the
sea
with
standing
room
no
more
than
six
or
eight
feet
square
the
view
was
superb
the
peaks
formed
the
northern
end
of
a
long
line
of
cliffs
running
back
to
the
south
at
the
end
of
glen
canyon
and
we
looked
out
across
a
wonderful
region
part
of
that
on
the
south
being
the
painted
desert
so
called
by
ives
mountains
solid
and
solitary
rose
up
here
and
there
and
line
upon
line
of
strangely
coloured
cliffs
broke
across
the
wide
area
while
from
our
feet
stretching
off
to
the
like
a
great
dark
dragon
extending
miles
into
the
blue
was
the
deep
gorge
of
marble
canyon
its
tributary
chasms
appearing
like
mighty
sprawling
legs
far
away
west
were
the
san
francisco
mountains
and
the
kaibab
while
behind
we
saw
navajo
mountain
and
others
this
peak
or
cluster
of
peaks
of
course
had
never
been
named
had
never
been
climbed
before
but
they
soon
named
themselves
for
amusement
i
tried
to
shoot
into
the
river
with
cap
remington
revolver
as
i
pulled
the
trigger
the
noise
was
absolutely
staggering
the
violent
report
was
followed
by
dead
silence
while
we
were
remarking
the
intensity
of
the
crash
from
far
away
on
some
distant
cliffs
northward
the
sound
waves
were
hurled
back
to
us
with
a
rattle
like
that
of
musketry
we
tried
again
with
the
same
result
the
interval
between
the
great
roar
and
the
echo
being
seconds
by
the
watch
we
could
call
the
place
nothing
but
echo
peaks
and
since
then
the
name
has
been
applied
also
to
the
line
of
cliffs
breaking
to
the
south
our
descent
was
easy
and
we
reached
camp
without
any
incident
except
the
loss
of
my
sheath
knife
nobody
did
anything
the
next
day
for
it
was
sunday
so
when
monday
morning
came
we
were
eager
to
be
off
for
the
mouth
of
the
paria
which
we
had
seen
from
the
top
of
echo
peaks
two
or
three
miles
down
we
reached
it
a
small
river
coming
through
a
great
canyon
on
the
right
the
cliffs
of
glen
canyon
broke
back
and
in
a
v
form
with
the
point
at
the
foot
of
glen
canyon
leaving
a
wide
platform
of
different
rock
rising
gently
from
under
them
and
mounting
steadily
toward
the
south
into
the
middle
of
this
the
river
immediately
slashed
a
narrow
gorge
very
much
as
a
staircase
might
be
cut
through
a
floor
beginning
the
next
canyon
of
the
series
called
marble
through
which
we
would
not
descend
till
the
following
year
we
went
into
camp
on
the
left
bank
of
the
paria
and
the
right
of
the
colorado
camp
in
the
tall
willows
a
rough
scow
lay
there
which
the
major
had
built
the
year
before
when
on
his
way
from
kanab
to
the
moki
towns
for
there
is
no
ford
we
were
to
wait
here
for
our
which
the
major
on
arriving
at
kanab
was
to
start
back
with
rations
and
some
extra
horses
our
altitude
was
feet
showing
a
total
descent
for
the
season
of
feet
feet
from
gunnison
crossing
our
work
on
the
water
for
the
present
was
now
over
we
would
pursue
it
with
mule
and
pack
instead
of
with
boats
as
the
of
october
had
arrived
we
were
glad
to
avoid

we
began
to
look
hopefully
in
the
direction
from
which
we
expected
the
to
arrive
four
days
passed
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
it
we
had
to
put
ourselves
on
once
more
and
declared
that
if
the
train
did
not
soon
arrive
either
he
or
i
being
the
only
entirely
well
members
of
the
party
would
have
to
walk
out
to
kanab
and
obtain
relief
none
of
us
knew
anything
about
the
trail
on
the
and
i
climbed
the
cliffs
back
of
camp
to
a
height
of
two
thousand
feet
and
had
a
remarkable
view
similar
to
that
from
echo
peaks
on
saturday
october
in
the
morning
we
were
surprised
to
hear
from
the
opposite
or
south
side
of
the
river
an
indian
yell
and
looking
across
we
perceived
what
appeared
to
be
three
natives
with
horses
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
canyon
wall
here
very
low
we
prepared
one
of
the
boats
to
cross
and
find
out
what
was
wanted
when
a
fourth
figure
joined
the
group
and
in
good
english
came
the
words
long
drawn
out
on
landing
we
were
met
by
a
very
quiet
individual
who
said
he
was
jacob
hamblin
his
voice
was
so
low
his
manner
so
simple
his
clothing
so
usual
that
i
could
hardly
believe
that
this
was
utah
famous
and
manager
with
him
were
three
other
white
men
isaac
haight
george
adair
joe
mangum
and
nine
navajos
all
on
their
way
to
the
mormon
settlements
they
desired
to
be
put
across
the
river
and
we
willingly
offered
the
services
of
ourselves
and
our
boats
some
of
the
navajos
had
never
before
seen
so
large
a
stream
and
were
free
to
express
their
surprise
we
took
on
board
jacob
and
one
or
two
others
and
after
landing
them
made
several
trips
with
both
boats
to
ferry
the
rest
over
including
all
their
saddles
and
baggage
the
navajos
were
rather
afraid
of
the
boats
which
to
them
probably
looked
small
and
wobbly
but
they
all
got
on
board
with
much
hilarity
except
one
who
preferred
to
swim
he
struck
boldly
out
with
a
sort
of
stroke
having
no
confidence
in
his
swimming
ability
we
followed
closely
the
water
was
cold
the
distance
greater
than
the
navajo
had
imagined
before
he
was
one
third
of
the
way
over
he
consented
to
be
pulled
into
our
boat
and
finish
the
passage
that
way
the
horses
were
towed
over
swimming
behind
the
boats
a
rope
being
held
by
a
man
sitting
in
the
stern
there
was
a
rapid
not
far
below
and
we
feared
if
driven
in
to
swim
loose
they
might
be
drawn
into
it
one
horse
refused
to
swim
or
even
to
try
and
made
repeated
efforts
to
plunge
his
head
under
giving
us
a
lot
of
trouble
but
by
holding
his
head
close
to
the
boat
we
towed
him
across
in
spite
of
his
opposition
without
the
boat
he
would
surely
have
gone
down
the
river
when
everybody
and
everything
were
safely
across
the
hour
was
so
late
that
jacob
concluded
to
camp
with
us
for
the
night
the
navajos
were
found
to
be
a
very
jolly
set
of
fellows
ready
to
take
or
give
any
amount
of
chaff
and
perfectly
honest
they
were
taking
blankets
of
their
manufacture
to
trade
for
horses
and
sheep
their
spirits
ran
high
they
sang
their
wild
songs
for
us
and
we
had
the
liveliest
evening
we
had
seen
in
many
a
month
finally
we
joined
in
a
circle
with
them
dancing
and
singing
around
the
smouldering
fire
while
the
chief
konéco
a
fellow
sitting
at
one
side
with
a
patriarchal
expression
monotonously
drummed
an
accompaniment
with
a
willow
root
on
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
when
any
of
us
would
stumble
on
a
stick
they
were
all
convulsed
with
laughter
the
blankets
they
had
were
beautiful
and
jacob
possessed
one
valued
at
which
had
taken
seventy
days
to
make
after
the
navajos
had
gone
to
rest
we
listened
to
some
mormon
songs
by
jacob
party
they
left
us
the
next
morning
sunday
october
obtaining
from
jacob
some
red
mexican
beans
to
eke
out
our
supplies
also
a
description
of
the
trail
i
traded
a
cap
i
happened
to
have
to
one
of
the
navajos
for
his
feather
plume
and
a
pair
of
shoes
to
one
of
the
white
men
for
some
mishongnuvi
moccasins
monday
we
took
the
across
the
river
and
some
distance
down
we
hauled
her
by
means
of
ropes
up
high
above
the
water
under
a
large
rock
where
we
concealed
her
well
then
we
made
five
caches
near
camp
of
goods
not
needed
till
next
year
covering
our
traces
by
fires
and
other
devices
jones
was
so
much
improved
that
he
managed
to
hobble
about
on
a
pair
of
crutches
i
had
made
for
him
out
of
strong
willow
sticks
and
we
felt
much
encouraged
as
to
his
ability
to
stand
riding
when
the
time
came
to
start
for
kanab
on
tuesday
we
built
a
shelter
back
of
camp
for
the
and
housed
her
there
the
next
day
was
the
first
of
november
and
we
thought
surely
the
would
come
but
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
cliffs
and
no
one
arrived
could
not
understand
what
the
trouble
was
but
he
went
on
with
his
observations
the
next
morning
as
we
were
about
to
eat
our
bean
breakfast
beside
the
fire
we
were
astonished
by
the
extremely
cautious
appearance
through
the
willows
without
a
word
of
announcement
of
a
single
ragged
woebegone
silent
old
man
on
as
skinny
and
tottering
a
pony
as
ever
i
saw
the
old
man
was
apparently
much
surprised
to
find
himself
here
and
with
the
exclamation
my
god
i
have
found
you
he
dropped
to
the
ground
when
at
last
he
spoke
he
said
his
name
was
mangum
of
kanab
and
that
he
had
been
employed
to
guide
our
of
which
riley
one
of
the
prospectors
we
had
met
at
el
vado
was
leader
well
where
is
the
train
we
asked
for
if
he
were
all
that
remained
of
it
we
wanted
to
know
it
soon
several
miles
back
on
the
trail
he
said
not
having
eaten
a
mouthful
since
the
morning
before
it
was
no
wonder
he
was
weak
and
silent
we
gave
him
the
best
breakfast
we
could
command
from
our
meagre
stock
and
then
like
a
spectre
he
vanished
on
his
scrawny
steed
up
the
paria
canyon
all
the
day
long
we
watched
and
waited
for
his
triumphal
return
with
the
supplies
at
his
back
but
the
sun
departed
without
his
approach
and
the
twilight
died
into
that
mystery
which
leaves
the
world
formless
against
the
night
and
still
we
had
faith
in
the
stranger
story
early
the
next
morning
clem
and
i
started
on
his
track
thinking
we
would
soon
meet
the
train
it
led
us
up
the
valley
of
the
paria
between
the
great
cliffs
about
three
miles
and
then
we
had
another
surprise
for
it
swung
sharply
to
the
right
and
climbed
a
steep
sandy
slope
towards
the
only
apparent
place
where
the
cliffs
could
possibly
be
scaled
with
horses
we
saw
that
he
had
followed
a
very
old
indian
trail
when
we
had
mounted
to
the
base
of
the
vertical
rocks
we
travelled
back
and
forth
across
the
face
of
the
precipice
till
presently
the
trail
passed
through
a
notch
out
upon
the
plateau
from
an
eminence
we
now
scanned
the
whole
visible
area
without
discovering
anything
that
apparently
had
not
been
there
for
several
thousand
years
save
the
coming
and
going
tracks
of
our
strange
visitor
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
any
living
animal
had
trod
this
place
in
centuries
we
could
see
to
where
and
i
previously
climbed
to
this
same
plateau
and
was
like
yesterday
and
yesterday
like
the
year
before
last
time
and
the
years
were
as
little
grains
of
drifting
sand
leaving
clem
as
a
sentinel
on
our
observation
point
followed
the
out
track
and
told
me
to
follow
the
in
till
three
it
was
now
high
noon
i
walked
on
and
on
through
an
arid
wonderful
maze
of
sand
rocks
and
cacti
feeling
that
the
old
horseman
was
no
more
than
a
phantom
when
in
half
an
hour
i
almost
fell
upon
our
lost
meandering
slowly
and
silently
through
a
depression
i
fired
our
signal
shots
and
soon
joined
us
the
situation
was
precarious
the
animals
were
nearly
dead
from
thirst
one
had
been
abandoned
and
riley
was
in
a
state
of
rage
that
was
dangerous
for
the
spectre
guide
who
had
nearly
been
the
destruction
of
the
whole
outfit
for
he
did
not
know
the
trail
and
was
himself
lost
of
course
he
blamed
riley
it
was
his
only
defence
riley
broke
loose
in
a
string
of
fiery
oaths
declaring
he
would
shoot
the
old
fool
then
and
there
but
receiving
no
encouragement
from
or
me
he
did
there
was
a
third
member
of
the
party
joe
hamblin
a
son
of
jacob
a
very
sturdy
young
fellow
he
said
afterwards
that
he
thought
often
that
riley
would
sure
let
daylight
through
the
old
man
our
next
care
was
to
successfully
manoeuvre
the
down
the
difficult
trail
across
the
face
of
the
cliff
which
had
not
seen
a
horse
for
many
a
year
and
probably
never
had
been
traversed
by
animals
with
packs
on
their
backs
we
had
to
watch
that
they
did
not
crowd
each
other
off
but
with
all
our
exertions
one
fell
and
rolled
down
a
few
feet
he
was
not
injured
and
we
continued
the
descent
finally
reaching
the
bottom
without
so
much
as
a
scratch
of
any
consequence
there
at
the
paria
the
horses
enjoyed
the
first
full
drink
for
several
days
and
we
followed
it
down
to
camp
riley
had
started
from
kanab
october
and
had
been
twelve
days
making
a
journey
that
required
at
most
only
four
or
five
by
the
regular
trail
mangum
had
not
known
the
way
had
led
toward
el
vado
and
his
finding
the
indian
trail
to
the
mouth
of
the
paria
was
an
accident
provisions
were
now
plenty
again
and
by
the
light
of
a
big
fire
we
overhauled
the
mail
finding
letters
newspapers
and
magazines
enough
to
satisfy
any
party
word
was
received
from
the
major
to
move
to
a
place
called
house
rock
spring
and
said
we
would
leave
camp
on
november
which
gave
us
a
day
intervening
in
which
to
pack
up
about
noon
of
this
packing
day
we
were
not
surprised
when
two
horsemen
haight
and
riggs
galloped
into
camp
at
full
speed
leading
a
lightly
laden
they
had
come
through
in
two
and
one
half
days
at
top
speed
by
direction
of
jacob
who
on
reaching
kanab
with
the
navajos
learned
that
our
had
left
long
before
and
he
had
seen
nothing
of
it
on
the
were
fifty
pounds
of
flour
and
several
rolls
of
butter
the
first
time
we
had
seen
any
of
this
latter
article
since
the
final
breakfast
at
field
on
may
they
were
greatly
relieved
to
know
that
the
train
was
found
and
that
all
was
well
they
brought
news
of
the
burning
of
chicago
about
a
month
before
in
the
evening
isaac
haight
favoured
us
with
some
mormon
songs
and
recited
examples
of
the
marvellous
curative
effects
of
the
mormon
laying
on
of
hands
heavy
clouds
had
settled
along
the
face
of
the
cliffs
and
the
air
grew
wintry
we
felt
the
chill
keenly
as
we
were
not
clad
for
cold
weather
in
the
morning
snow
began
to
drop
gently
out
of
the
leaden
sky
and
continued
all
day
preventing
any
one
from
starting
soon
the
cliffs
and
echo
peaks
were
white
and
we
knew
that
now
autumn
was
gone
toward
evening
the
sun
flared
across
the
rocky
landscape
turning
everything
to
gold
and
we
believed
the
next
day
would
be
fair
we
were
not
disappointed
monday
the
of
november
came
sharp
and
cold
haight
riggs
mangum
and
joe
hamblin
left
early
and
we
got
under
way
as
soon
as
we
could
with
two
very
sick
men
and
a
new
method
of
travel
it
was
not
easy
we
had
to
learn
the
art
of
packing
on
mules
and
horses
from
riley
who
was
an
expert
in
this
line
and
who
could
sling
the
diamond
hitch
with
great
skill
he
was
just
as
handy
with
a
lasso
and
seldom
missed
if
he
wished
to
catch
an
animal
but
did
not
approve
of
the
lasso
method
for
it
makes
stock
wild
and
unmanageable
his
way
was
the
quiet
one
and
he
was
right
for
we
soon
had
the
entire
herd
so
that
there
was
no
rumpus
at
with
a
free
use
of
the
lasso
preparations
to
start
partake
of
the
activity
of
a
tornado
steward
by
this
time
was
able
to
walk
slowly
andy
was
well
enough
to
travel
on
his
feet
but
jones
could
not
move
at
all
without
crutches
we
did
not
have
extra
horses
for
all
to
ride
so
steward
and
andy
changed
off
while
the
rest
of
us
had
to
walk
jones
we
lifted
as
gently
as
possible
though
it
was
pain
even
to
be
touched
in
his
condition
upon
riley
special
horse
called
doc
a
docile
animal
who
walked
off
with
him
it
was
after
noon
before
the
start
was
accomplished
and
meanwhile
i
went
back
on
the
incoming
trail
of
the
lost
to
the
foot
of
the
steep
precipice
for
riley
canteen
which
had
been
forgotten
there
and
when
i
returned
all
were
gone
but
steward
clem
and
beaman
who
had
remained
behind
to
round
up
a
young
steer
which
had
been
driven
in
with
the
train
for
us
to
convert
into
beef
at
a
convenient
opportunity
as
the
advance
party
travelled
very
slowly
we
soon
caught
them
the
steer
being
gentle
as
a
kitten
the
trail
followed
south
along
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
which
emerged
from
paria
canyon
and
to
which
the
major
had
given
the
name
of
vermilion
on
account
of
their
rich
red
colour
we
wound
in
and
out
of
deep
alcoves
around
the
heads
of
impassable
lateral
canyons
running
to
the
colorado
and
past
enormous
rocks
balanced
in
every
conceivable
position
on
extremely
slender
pedestals
after
about
eight
miles
we
arrived
at
a
diminutive
spring
which
gave
enough
water
for
andy
to
make
bread
and
coffee
with
but
none
for
the
stock
there
we
camped
a
few
armfuls
of
scraggy
furnished
wood
for
a
fire
but
it
was
not
enough
to
make
our
invalids
comfortable
and
the
night
was
cold
and
raw
we
did
all
we
could
for
them
and
they
did
not
grumble
in
the
morning
a
pair
of
bronchos
that
is
recently
broken
wild
horses
made
the
camp
lively
for
a
time
but
they
were
subdued
and
the
caravan
again
got
under
way
our
next
camp
was
to
be
jacob
pools
so
called
from
the
fact
that
jacob
was
the
first
white
man
to
camp
there
we
had
gone
only
a
mile
or
so
when
we
crossed
in
a
small
canyon
a
little
stream
already
enjoying
two
names
clear
and
spring
now
called
badger
creek
and
a
little
farther
on
another
called
soap
creek
still
holding
that
name
when
first
travellers
enter
a
country
they
naturally
bestow
names
on
important
objects
and
two
or
three
parties
of
white
men
who
had
passed
this
way
had
named
these
two
creeks
after
this
we
had
no
more
water
and
we
pushed
slowly
ahead
looking
for
the
pools
snow
began
to
fall
again
in
widely
scattered
reluctant
flakes
but
melted
on
touching
the
ground
late
in
the
afternoon
the
trail
turned
the
corner
of
the
cliffs
which
here
broke
to
the
west
and
we
saw
a
wide
desolate
open
plain
stretching
away
to
the
foot
of
a
distant
which
we
knew
to
be
the
kaibab
plateau
or
buckskin
mountain
none
of
the
party
had
been
over
the
trail
before
but
it
was
easy
to
follow
especially
for
a
man
of
riley
experience
it
was
an
old
navajo
trail
and
was
here
fairly
well
worn
the
sun
went
down
as
we
plodded
on
the
light
faded
from
the
west
and
still
we
saw
no
jacob
pools
the
air
was
biting
and
with
our
thin
worn
garments
we
felt
it
keenly
and
wished
for
a
fire
at
last
just
as
the
darkness
began
to
thicken
a
patch
of
reeds
on
the
right
between
some
low
hills
was
discovered
where
it
seemed
there
might
be
water
and
we
could
not
well
go
farther
the
ground
was
moist
and
by
digging
a
hole
we
secured
red
muddy
liquid
enough
for
andy
to
make
a
little
bread
and
a
cup
apiece
of
very
poor
coffee
the
men
and
animals
came
straggling
in
out
of
the
darkness
we
gathered
a
lot
of
and
made
a
fire
and
as
soon
as
jones
came
we
lifted
him
off
and
put
him
as
near
the
warmth
as
possible
for
he
was
chilled
through
there
was
no
water
for
the
stock
but
the
grass
was
wet
and
they
did
not
suffer
everything
was
damp
and
uncomfortable
and
the
fire
was
too
small
to
dry
anything
out
so
all
turned
in
to
the
limited
blankets
and
passed
a
cold
uncomfortable
night
morning
was
a
relief
though
the
thermometer
stood
at
there
was
water
enough
in
the
holes
for
breakfast
and
as
soon
as
this
meal
was
over
the
was
on
the
move
towards
jacob
pools
which
we
found
not
two
miles
farther
on
there
were
two
of
them
each
seven
or
eight
feet
long
supplied
by
fine
clear
water
oozing
out
of
a
the
lower
one
we
turned
over
to
the
animals
reserving
the
upper
for
ourselves
we
approached
the
plateau
all
day
and
late
in
the
afternoon
we
were
within
three
or
four
miles
of
it
when
the
cliffs
turned
sharply
to
the
north
in
a
line
parallel
with
the
plateau
forming
a
long
narrow
valley
cedars
and
piñons
now
grew
about
us
so
that
we
were
assured
of
a
good
fire
about
sunset
we
passed
two
large
boulders
which
had
fallen
together
forming
a
rude
shelter
under
which
riggs
or
some
one
else
had
slept
and
then
had
jocosely
printed
above
with
charcoal
the
words
rock
house
hotel
afterward
this
had
served
as
identification
and
jacob
and
the
others
had
spoken
of
house
rock
spring
and
house
rock
valley
we
called
it
the
same
and
finally
it
went
on
the
maps
and
is
now
permanent
a
few
yards
beyond
the
house
rock
the
trail
led
into
a
gulch
at
the
head
of
which
was
a
good
spring
plenty
of
cedars
and
piñons
grew
about
and
we
soon
had
a
fire
that
compensated
for
the
meagre
ones
of
the
preceding
nights
the
sick
men
became
warm
and
dry
and
we
all
felt
much
better
the
whole
outfit
halted
two
days
and
on
the
second
the
poor
little
steer
gazing
sadly
at
us
was
shot
and
cut
up
in
an
hour
the
quarters
were
swinging
from
a
tree
and
some
of
the
beef
was
in
the
pan
necessity
is
a
sauce
that
makes
every
grist
palatable
we
were
hungry
and
nothing
could
have
tasted
better
than
that
fresh
beefsteak
the
entrails
and
refuse
were
left
on
the
ground
in
the
neighbouring
gulley
where
we
had
killed
the
steer
and
next
morning
the
place
was
about
cleaned
up
by
the
lurking
wolves
decided
to
go
on
across
the
kaibab
to
kanab
with
the
two
very
sick
men
and
leave
clem
andy
and
me
here
at
house
rock
spring
until
the
plan
for
the
winter
campaign
had
been
better
formulated
steward
concluded
that
his
condition
was
too
precarious
to
risk
further
exposure
and
said
he
would
now
leave
the
expedition
permanently
which
we
learned
with
deep
regret
but
it
was
plainly
imperative
jones
thought
that
a
week
or
two
of
warmth
and
rest
accompanied
by
a
change
of
diet
would
make
him
whole
again
and
enable
him
to
stay
till
the
end
of
our
special
task
on
saturday
november
the
party
started
with
the
invalids
riding
the
gentlest
and
easiest
horses
though
steward
found
it
less
painful
at
times
to
walk
i
accompanied
them
to
the
summit
of
the
kaibab
to
bring
back
one
of
the
horses
we
called
thunderbolt
on
which
jones
was
to
be
carried
to
the
top
and
there
change
to
doc
after
i
left
them
i
halted
many
times
to
look
out
into
the
wonderful
land
to
the
west
and
north
when
i
got
back
to
the
spring
our
camp
of
the
land
operations
we
immediately
set
up
a
stout
by
tent
that
was
in
the
outfit
brought
from
kanab
and
it
made
a
very
snug
for
the
four
of
us
around
the
fire
we
rolled
big
stones
for
seats
and
soon
had
the
gulch
in
a
homelike
condition
there
was
an
abundance
of
dead
fat
piñon
which
burned
like
a
candle
and
we
could
easily
extend
our
reading
into
the
evenings
from
all
around
us
there
arose
the
frequent
bay
and
bark
of
the
wolves
they
were
of
different
kinds
numerous
and
rather
bold
at
night
they
came
in
and
cleared
up
what
was
left
of
the
entrails
of
the
steer
also
securing
a
fine
large
piece
of
beef
which
cap
had
hung
in
a
tree
but
not
high
enough
to
escape
their
efforts
we
took
turns
bringing
the
four
horses
left
with
us
to
water
and
in
that
way
kept
ourselves
informed
about
them
during
these
trips
especially
in
the
late
afternoon
the
wolves
were
apt
to
trot
along
near
by
and
on
one
occasion
clem
was
obliged
to
drive
one
out
of
the
trail
with
stones
not
having
his
rifle
one
morning
as
i
was
riding
along
not
far
from
camp
a
huge
whitish
fellow
followed
behind
like
a
dog
about
twenty
yards
back
licking
his
chaps
at
first
i
thought
he
might
be
the
dog
of
some
indian
camped
near
but
remembering
that
there
were
none
in
the
valley
and
also
that
an
indian
dog
or
any
strange
dog
would
have
run
from
me
i
saw
that
he
was
a
hungry
wolf
unused
to
man
i
had
no
rifle
with
me
but
i
took
a
walk
over
the
same
ground
next
morning
with
my
winchester
hoping
to
see
my
acquaintance
again
but
he
discreetly
kept
out
of
sight
we
had
little
now
to
occupy
us
except
to
examine
the
locality
chop
wood
for
our
fire
and
read
over
and
over
the
newspapers
and
magazines
the
nights
were
very
cold
the
spring
always
freezing
over
but
the
days
were
delightful
the
beef
had
to
be
jerked
to
preserve
it
we
cut
it
up
into
thin
long
strips
which
we
strung
through
the
ends
on
long
withes
these
in
turn
being
hung
on
a
framework
that
left
the
strips
swinging
within
two
or
three
feet
of
a
slow
fire
one
hour
neglect
of
this
tempting
array
would
have
seen
it
vanish
to
the
four
winds
so
we
kept
a
constant
watch
day
and
night
taking
turns
through
the
dark
hours
every
article
which
had
grease
or
leather
about
it
had
to
be
carefully
put
away
to
prevent
its
disappearance
riley
had
lost
his
spurs
on
the
way
out
from
this
cause
the
leather
on
them
making
sweet
morsels
for
the
watchers
cap
concluded
to
profit
by
this
appetite
and
in
an
adjoining
gulch
he
built
a
trap
between
two
rocks
in
which
he
set
his
remington
so
that
a
wolf
picking
up
a
scrap
of
beef
would
pull
the
trigger
by
a
string
and
receive
the
ball
in
his
head
that
night
during
my
watch
over
the
beef
i
roasted
a
piece
on
a
stick
for
a
lunch
and
as
the
savory
odour
drifted
off
on
the
crisp
winter
air
howl
after
howl
of
ravenous
desire
rang
out
from
many
directions
followed
by
the
bang
of
the
revolver
in
the
trap
cap
went
over
but
found
no
game
though
later
he
often
came
back
with
a
fine
large
specimen
bearing
a
perfect
coat
of
fur
which
cap
always
removed
by
the
firelight
at
once
about
every
night
except
sunday
when
cap
refused
to
set
the
trap
for
he
never
did
any
work
on
that
day
that
was
not
absolutely
necessary
there
was
a
fatal
shot
and
he
accumulated
a
lot
of
excellent
large
skins
which
he
tacked
on
trees
to
preserve
them
he
thought
he
had
put
them
up
securely
high
but
one
morning
every
skin
had
disappeared
the
wolf
relatives
had
carried
them
away
to
the
last
shred
illustration
the
grand
canyon
from
havasupai
point
south
rim
showing
inner
gorge
from
a
sketch
in
colour
by
dellenbaugh
the
kaibab
was
too
far
away
for
us
to
go
there
to
hunt
deer
and
there
were
none
around
the
spring
though
one
night
at
the
western
sky
being
a
broad
sweep
of
deep
orange
we
saw
a
large
wild
animal
of
some
sort
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
silhouetted
against
the
colour
i
started
for
it
with
my
rifle
but
of
course
it
did
not
wait
no
animal
ever
does
if
he
can
help
it
unless
he
is
carnivorous
and
famished
the
weather
remained
generally
fair
though
one
day
we
had
a
wild
gale
that
nearly
relieved
us
of
the
tent
in
the
midst
of
thick
flurries
of
snow
we
often
climbed
among
the
cliffs
and
everywhere
we
found
poles
laid
up
fragments
of
pottery
arrowheads
and
other
evidences
of
former
occupation
the
poles
and
stones
may
have
been
placed
by
the
pai
utes
as
well
as
by
the
old
shinumos
who
once
were
numerous
over
all
this
country
cap
was
by
no
means
well
an
extreme
nervousness
connected
with
the
old
gunshot
wound
developed
and
he
said
he
felt
sure
he
could
not
continue
the
work
in
the
field
during
the
winter
much
less
go
through
the
grand
canyon
with
us
the
next
year
clem
also
felt
under
the
weather
and
besides
was
growing
homesick
he
confided
to
me
one
day
that
he
also
had
concluded
not
to
remain
with
us
as
there
was
little
the
matter
with
him
i
undertook
to
argue
him
out
of
his
determination
not
to
go
through
the
grand
canyon
pointing
out
the
disappointment
he
would
feel
when
we
had
accomplished
the
passage
and
he
realised
that
he
might
as
well
have
come
along
this
produced
some
impression
but
i
was
uncertain
as
to
its
lasting
result
by
november
we
began
with
confidence
to
look
for
some
one
to
come
over
the
mountains
from
kanab
and
just
after
sunset
we
heard
long
shrill
ee
ii
oooooooo
which
he
could
deliver
upon
the
air
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
carried
for
miles
presently
and
he
rode
into
our
camp
with
fresh
supplies
and
a
great
bundle
of
mail
that
included
papers
giving
the
details
of
the
burning
of
chicago
with
cap
then
reconnoitred
the
neighbourhood
and
on
the
he
returned
to
kanab
leaving
us
as
before
except
that
riley
remained
two
days
longer
the
major
had
not
yet
arrived
at
kanab
from
salt
lake
and
our
winter
work
could
not
begin
till
he
came
the
days
rolled
by
with
occasional
rain
and
snow
and
we
began
to
grow
impatient
with
our
inaction
especially
when
november
passed
away
the
second
day
of
december
was
fading
when
we
distinguished
in
the
distance
the
familiar
riley
yell
and
in
a
little
while
he
came
into
view
with
welcome
news
we
were
to
move
at
once
to
a
spring
eight
miles
from
kanab
he
also
brought
some
apples
native
raisins
and
a
large
canteen
full
of
fresh
wine
from
dixie
as
the
country
along
the
virgin
was
called
these
luxuries
together
with
a
number
of
letters
from
home
made
that
night
one
of
the
most
cheerful
we
had
known
for
a
long
time
monday
morning
december
we
left
house
rock
spring
behind
with
our
followed
the
trail
across
the
open
valley
climbed
two
thousand
feet
to
the
top
of
the
kaibab
and
were
soon
traversing
the
forest
on
its
broad
summit
riley
having
been
over
the
trail
now
several
times
we
went
ahead
steadily
and
about
sunset
arrived
at
the
farther
side
of
a
narrow
longitudinal
depression
of
the
top
which
cap
immediately
put
down
in
his
notes
as
summit
valley
a
name
that
holds
there
we
threw
off
our
packs
and
made
camp
for
the
night
though
there
was
no
water
the
ground
was
covered
by
a
thin
layer
of
snow
that
made
the
long
bunch
grass
palatable
to
the
horses
and
for
ourselves
we
had
sufficient
water
in
two
small
kegs
and
several
canteens
a
bright
fire
blazed
cheerfully
the
dense
cedars
broke
the
wind
and
everybody
felt
that
it
was
a
fine
camp
the
others
spent
the
evening
playing
euchre
by
firelight
but
i
preferred
to
read
till
bedtime
the
next
morning
after
crossing
some
rough
gulches
we
came
to
the
western
edge
of
the
great
plateau
and
emerging
from
the
forest
of
pine
and
cedar
we
saw
again
the
magnificent
kaleidoscopic
cliff
country
lying
to
the
north
first
about
twenty
miles
away
was
a
line
of
low
cliffs
then
a
few
miles
back
of
this
the
splendid
line
of
the
vermilion
cliffs
the
same
which
began
at
the
mouth
of
glen
canyon
and
which
we
had
skirted
to
house
rock
spring
from
there
the
line
continued
northward
till
it
passed
around
the
north
end
of
the
kaibab
when
it
struck
southwesterly
far
to
our
left
where
it
turned
back
to
the
north
again
forming
one
of
the
longest
and
finest
cliff
ranges
anywhere
to
be
seen
above
them
and
some
miles
still
farther
back
rising
higher
was
a
line
of
greyish
cliffs
following
the
trend
of
the
vermilion
and
still
above
these
was
the
broken
meandering
face
of
the
pink
cliffs
frosted
with
snow
whose
crest
marks
the
southeastern
limit
of
fremont
great
basin
the
end
of
the
high
plateaus
and
tops
the
country
at
an
altitude
of
some
feet
above
a
more
extraordinary
bewildering
landscape
both
as
to
form
and
colour
could
hardly
be
found
in
all
the
world
winding
our
way
down
to
the
barren
valley
in
itself
more
a
high
plateau
than
a
valley
we
travelled
the
rest
of
the
day
in
the
direction
of
the
great
cliffs
the
sun
was
just
gone
when
we
reached
the
first
low
line
and
passing
through
a
gap
turned
into
a
side
gulch
thickly
studded
with
cedars
where
we
saw
before
us
two
waggons
two
or
three
blazing
and
friends
we
heard
a
hearty
voice
cry
tirtaan
aigles
dis
wai
and
we
sprang
from
our
horses
to
grasp
jack
welcoming
hand
and
greet
all
the
others
some
of
whom
were
new
acquaintances
the
fragrance
of
coffee
and
frying
bacon
filled
the
sharp
air
while
from
the
summits
of
the
surrounding
cliffs
the
hungry
chorus
of
yelping
wolves
sent
up
their
wail
of
disappointment
in
an
alcove
a
large
tent
had
been
put
up
which
the
major
family
was
occupying
for
powell
and
her
baby
daughter
had
come
from
salt
lake
with
him
arriving
a
few
days
before
the
daughter
was
but
three
months
old
and
was
happy
in
a
big
for
a
cradle
thompson
wife
and
sister
of
the
major
had
also
come
from
salt
lake
and
another
large
tent
sheltered
them
while
still
another
of
equal
size
not
yet
erected
was
designed
for
the
men
it
was
a
specially
interesting
camp
to
us
who
had
come
over
from
house
rock
for
it
was
novel
to
see
so
many
people
around
the
major
himself
was
absent
at
kanab
before
the
camp
was
asleep
the
hour
was
late
and
so
soundly
did
every
one
rest
that
the
sneaking
wolves
without
the
least
molestation
carried
off
two
large
sacks
of
the
jerked
beef
from
near
our
heads
where
we
had
put
it
against
a
huge
rock
thinking
they
would
not
come
so
close
but
as
they
had
pulled
a
ham
the
night
before
from
under
the
head
of
captain
dodds
where
he
had
placed
it
for
safety
we
ought
to
have
been
more
sensible
two
or
three
nights
later
as
i
was
sleeping
in
a
special
bed
one
of
the
men
then
absent
had
made
by
a
big
rock
some
yards
from
the
main
camp
i
was
awakened
by
a
wolf
crunching
bones
by
the
fire
not
eight
feet
from
my
head
i
wanted
to
shoot
the
impertinent
wretch
but
his
form
was
indistinct
and
my
rifle
lying
by
my
side
had
to
be
trained
his
way
this
took
some
time
as
i
had
to
move
cautiously
and
in
the
midst
of
my
effort
my
elbow
slipped
like
a
shadow
he
flitted
into
the
deeper
gloom
and
i
went
to
sleep
again
i
did
not
want
to
shoot
without
certainty
though
some
nights
later
i
did
shoot
with
riley
huge
shotgun
loaded
with
buckshot
straight
into
our
mess
kit
not
killing
the
wolf
that
was
there
but
putting
holes
in
numerous
tin
plates
through
which
bean
soup
delighted
to
percolate
so
that
i
never
heard
the
last
of
this
midnight
effort
of
mine
to
diminish
the
wolf
family
the
day
following
our
arrival
the
major
came
from
kanab
and
the
plans
for
our
winter
campaign
were
put
in
operation
a
base
line
for
our
geographic
work
was
necessary
and
this
was
to
run
south
from
kanab
so
on
december
with
thompson
clem
andy
jones
who
had
recovered
his
health
and
one
of
the
new
men
named
macentee
left
us
with
loaded
waggons
to
establish
another
camp
nearer
to
the
scene
of
this
work
another
member
of
the
party
was
fuzz
thompson
dog
an
intelligent
dandie
dinmont
as
i
was
much
interested
to
see
kanab
of
which
so
much
had
been
said
and
as
it
was
now
nearly
seven
months
since
i
had
seen
an
occupied
house
i
decided
to
take
a
sunday
ride
in
that
direction
on
the
about
noon
i
put
a
saddle
on
a
white
mule
which
jack
had
named
nigger
and
was
soon
on
my
way
emerging
from
the
chocolate
cliffs
the
road
led
along
the
foot
of
the
vermilion
cliffs
crossing
long
ridges
covered
with
cedars
and
piñons
with
a
vast
view
to
the
kaibab
on
the
south
and
east
and
soon
joining
a
road
that
led
from
a
canyon
to
eastward
where
there
was
a
very
small
settlement
called
johnson
and
from
two
or
three
houses
which
had
been
built
where
the
el
vado
trail
crossed
the
paria
river
nigger
went
along
very
well
and
i
was
in
kanab
by
three
the
village
which
had
been
started
only
a
year
or
two
was
laid
out
in
the
characteristic
mormon
style
with
wide
streets
and
regular
lots
fenced
by
wattling
willows
between
stakes
irrigating
ditches
ran
down
each
side
of
every
street
and
from
them
the
water
derived
from
a
creek
that
came
down
a
canyon
back
of
the
town
could
be
led
into
any
of
the
lots
each
of
which
was
about
one
quarter
of
an
acre
that
is
there
were
four
lots
to
a
block
fruit
trees
shade
trees
and
vines
had
been
planted
and
were
already
beginning
to
promise
near
results
while
corn
potatoes
gave
fine
crops
the
original
place
of
settlement
was
a
square
formed
by
log
houses
on
three
sides
and
a
stockade
on
the
fourth
this
was
called
the
fort
and
was
a
place
of
refuge
though
the
danger
from
navajo
attack
seemed
to
be
over
and
that
from
any
assault
by
the
pai
utes
certainly
was
past
one
corner
of
the
fort
was
made
by
the
walls
of
the
schoolhouse
which
was
at
the
same
time
and
altogether
there
were
about
families
in
the
village
the
houses
that
had
been
built
outside
the
fort
were
quite
substantially
constructed
some
of
adobe
or
brick
the
entire
settlement
had
a
thrifty
air
as
is
the
case
with
the
mormons
not
a
or
gambling
saloon
or
was
to
be
seen
quite
in
contrast
with
the
usual
disgraceful
accompaniments
of
the
ordinary
frontier
towns
a
perfectly
orderly
government
existed
headed
by
a
bishop
appointed
by
the
church
authorities
in
salt
lake
the
then
incumbent
of
this
office
being
an
excellent
man
bishop
stewart
i
rode
to
the
fort
where
i
found
clem
and
beaman
domiciled
with
their
photographic
outfit
with
a
swarm
of
children
peeping
through
every
chink
and
crevice
of
the
logs
to
get
a
view
of
the
gentiles
a
kind
of
animal
they
had
seldom
seen
every
one
was
cordial
beaman
even
offered
me
a
drink
made
with
and
photographic
alcohol
but
it
did
not
appeal
to
my
taste
it
was
after
sunset
when
i
started
nigger
towards
eight
mile
spring
and
i
enjoyed
the
ride
in
the
edge
of
night
with
not
a
living
thing
besides
nigger
and
nigger
was
a
mule
to
disturb
my
reveries
i
had
as
yet
seen
none
of
the
natives
of
the
locality
they
were
now
very
friendly
and
considered
harmless
thanks
to
jacob
wise
management
the
only
indians
the
settlers
dreaded
were
some
renegades
a
band
of
utes
and
navajos
collected
by
a
bold
and
skillful
chief
named
patnish
whose
country
was
south
of
the
colorado
around
navajo
mountain
he
was
reputed
to
be
highly
dangerous
and
the
kanab
people
were
constantly
prepared
against
his
unwelcome
visits
he
had
several
handsome
stalwart
sons
who
dressed
in
white
and
who
generally
accompanied
him
though
patnish
was
so
much
feared
i
do
not
remember
to
have
heard
that
he
committed
any
depredations
after
this
time
there
had
been
much
trouble
with
the
navajos
but
jacob
growing
tired
of
the
constant
warfare
had
resolved
to
go
to
them
and
see
if
he
could
not
change
the
state
of
affairs
when
he
had
guided
the
major
to
the
moki
towns
and
fort
defiance
the
year
before
about
six
thousand
navajos
were
assembled
at
the
agency
the
chiefs
were
invited
to
meet
in
council
on
the
of
november
and
all
the
principal
chiefs
but
one
and
all
subchiefs
but
two
were
there
the
major
led
the
way
by
introducing
jacob
and
speaking
in
highly
complimentary
terms
of
the
mormons
and
jacob
then
gave
a
long
talk
in
his
way
illustrating
the
great
evils
of
such
warfare
as
had
existed
and
closed
by
saying
what
shall
i
tell
my
people
the
when
i
return
home
that
we
may
expect
to
live
in
peace
live
as
friends
and
trade
with
one
another
or
shall
we
look
for
you
to
come
prowling
around
our
weak
settlements
like
wolves
in
the
night
i
hope
we
may
live
in
peace
in
time
to
come
i
have
now
grey
hairs
on
my
head
and
from
my
boyhood
i
have
been
on
the
frontiers
doing
all
i
could
to
preserve
peace
between
white
men
and
indians
i
despise
this
killing
this
shedding
of
blood
i
hope
you
will
stop
this
and
come
and
visit
and
trade
with
our
people
we
would
like
to
hear
what
you
have
got
to
say
before
we
go
home
barbenceta
the
principal
chief
slowly
approached
as
jacob
ended
and
putting
his
arms
around
him
said
my
friend
and
brother
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
to
bring
about
what
you
have
advised
we
will
not
give
all
our
answer
now
many
of
the
navajos
are
here
we
will
talk
to
them
and
will
see
you
on
your
way
home
several
days
later
jacob
met
him
and
the
chiefs
who
had
been
absent
he
said
they
would
all
really
like
to
see
peace
with
the
mormons
carried
out
and
continued
we
have
some
bad
men
among
us
but
if
some
do
wrong
the
wise
ones
must
not
act
foolishly
like
children
but
let
it
be
settled
according
to
the
spirit
of
your
talk
at
fort
defiance
here
is
hastele
i
wish
you
would
take
a
good
look
at
him
so
you
will
not
be
mistaken
in
the
man
he
never
lies
or
steals
he
is
a
truthful
man
we
wish
all
difficult
matters
settled
before
him
he
lives
on
the
frontier
nearest
to
the
river
you
can
find
him
by
inquiry
we
hope
we
may
be
able
to
eat
at
one
table
warm
by
one
fire
smoke
one
pipe
and
sleep
under
one
blanket

near

jacob
proceeded
towards
home
taking
a
moki
named
tuba
and
his
wife
back
with
him
so
that
they
might
see
the
mormon
country
arriving
at
the
crossing
of
the
colorado
tuba
was
sad
he
said
his
people
had
once
lived
on
the
other
side
and
their
fathers
had
told
them
they
never
again
would
go
west
of
the
river
to
live
i
am
now
going
on
a
visit
to
see
my
friends
i
have
worshipped
the
father
of
us
all
in
the
way
you
believe
to
be
right
now
i
wish
you
would
do
as
the
hopees
think
is
right
before
we
cross
jacob
assented
and
tuba
he
said
then
took
his
medicine
bag
from
under
his
shirt
and
offered
me
a
little
of
its
contents
i
offered
my
left
hand
to
take
it
he
requested
me
to
take
it
with
my
right
he
then
knelt
with
his
face
to
the
east
and
asked
the
great
father
of
us
all
to
preserve
us
in
crossing
the
river
he
said
that
he
and
his
wife
had
left
many
friends
at
home
and
if
they
never
lived
to
return
their
friends
would
weep
much
he
prayed
for
pity
upon
his
friends
the
mormons
that
none
of
them
might
drown
in
crossing
and
that
all
the
animals
we
had
with
us
might
be
spared
for
we
needed
them
all
and
to
preserve
unto
us
all
our
food
and
clothing
that
we
need
not
suffer
hunger
nor
cold
on
our
journey
he
then
arose
to
his
feet
we
scattered
the
ingredients
from
the
medicine
bag
into
the
air
on
to
the
land
and
into
the
water
of
the
river
when
they
were
all
safely
over

prayer
had
been

down

fired
on
at
dawn
some
escaped
though
wounded
jacob
kept
a
close
watch
on
all
the
passes
and
especially
at
el
vado
several
raiders
were
intercepted
and
shot
in
a
raiding
band
successfully
drove
off
twelve
hundred
head
of
horses
and
cattle
from
northern
settlements
and
the
winter
of
was
one
of
the
worst
requiring
jacob
presence
in
the
field
almost
constantly
he
was
accompanied
by
friendly
pai
utes
who
hated
the
navajos
one
navajo
was
shot
in
a
band
who
had
stolen
cattle
but
the
others
were
allowed
to
leave
on
giving
up
the
stock
the
shot
did
not
kill
the
navajo
and
they
followed
to
see
what
became
of
him
he
was
carried
along
by
his
friends
to
where
another
raiding
party
was
encamped
the
pai
utes
then
killed
two
of
this
party
scalping
one
but
refraining
from
taking
the
scalp
of
the
other
because
he
had
sandy
hair
and
looked
too
much
like
a
white
man
later
three
more
navajos
were
killed
in
a
fight
but
the
rest
escaped
with
ten
horses
jacob
grew
heartily
sick
of
this
kind
of
work
and
made
the
resolve
to
appeal
to
the
navajos
with
the
result
stated
he
also
visited
the
red
lake
utes
to
the
north
and
all
the
indians
along
the
sevier
beginning
with
the
band
of
navajos
under
agua
grande
which
we
had
met
at
el
vado
they
came
north
in
numerous
parties
with
perfect
confidence
that
the
mormons
would
receive
them
peacefully
but
they
continued
to
despise
the
pai
utes
considering
them
beneath
notice
in
september
of
the
year
the
major
by
brigham
young
advice
had
engaged
jacob
to
go
with
him
to
mt
trumbull
in
the
uinkaret
region
adjoining
the
shewits
country
jacob
wishing
to
see
these
indians
himself
was
very
willing
to
go
they
made
a
camp
by
a
spring
and
finding
some
natives
near
jacob
asked
them
to
bring
in
some
of
the
party
who
had
taken
part
in
the
killing
of
the
howlands
and
dunn
the
year
before
twelve
or
fifteen
finally
came
and
they
had
a
talk
i
commenced
said
jacob
by
explaining
to
the
indians
professor
powell
business
i
endeavoured
to
get
them
to
understand
that
he
did
not
visit
their
country
for
any
purpose
that
would
work
evil
to
them
that
he
was
not
hunting
gold
or
silver
or
other
metals
that
he
would
be
along
the
river
next
season
with
a
party
of
men
and
if
they
found
any
of
them
away
from
the
river
in
the
hills
they
must
be
their
friends
and
show
them
places
where
there
was
water
if
necessary
they
replied
that
friends
of
theirs
from
across
the
river
had
declared
the
men
were
miners
and
advised
killing
them
for
if
they
found
mines
it
would
bring
great
evil
among
them
the
men
were
followed
and
killed
while
asleep
they
declared
that
had
they
been
correctly
informed
about
the
men
they
would
not
have
killed
them
kapurats
meaning
the
major
they
said
could
travel
and
sleep
in
their
country
unmolested
and
they
would
show
him
and
his
men
the
on
december
we
moved
our
camp
from
eight
mile
spring
to
a
place
below
the
gap
in
the
chocolate
cliffs
south
of
kanab
and
not
far
below
the
boundary
the
parallel
bonnemort
and
i
remained
behind
to
gather
up
the
last
articles
and
it
was
dark
when
we
reached
the
new
ground
our
large
tent
was
pitched
in
the
creek
bottom
with
the
others
not
far
off
making
quite
a
settlement
the
weather
was
rainy
and
cold
but
a
conical
stove
heated
the
tent
well
and
there
we
had
dry
comfortable
evenings
some
of
the
men
singing
some
writing
letters
or
plotting
notes
others
reading
and
still
others
perhaps
playing
a
game
bonnemort
was
something
of
a
singer
and
was
specially
fond
of
isle
of
the
but
jack
still
maintained
his
complete
supremacy
as
a
tenor
his
repertory
always
increased
and
he
was
ever
ready
to
entertain
us
one
of
his
selections
i
remember
was
the
ballad
i
wandered
by
the
brookside
i
wandered
by
the
mill
i
could
not
hear
the
brook
flow
the
noisy
wheel
was
still
there
was
no
burr
of
grasshopper
no
chirp
of
any
bird
but
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
was
all
the
sound
i
heard
thompson
had
a
sweet
voice
and
knew
a
lot
of
songs
which
were
frequently
heard
issuing
from
her
tent
and
this
with
the
presence
of
powell
and
the
baby
added
to
the
locality
a
pleasant
homelike
air
both
thompson
and
powell
had
been
familiar
with
camp
life
powell
having
spent
a
winter
with
the
major
in
middle
park
colorado
near
the
camp
of
chief
douglas
the
father
of
our
friend
douglas
boy
andy
cooked
all
the
meals
on
a
fire
out
of
doors
and
they
were
no
longer
served
in
our
go
fur
it
boys
canyon
style
but
a
large
canvas
showing
by
its
colour
the
effects
of
exposure
was
elegantly
spread
on
the
ground
and
around
its
edges
the
tin
plates
cups
were
arranged
with
the
beanpot
and
other
provender
in
the
middle
this
method
continued
henceforth
the
company
would
sit
around
on
the
ground
each
in
whatever
position
was
comfortable
liberal
portions
of
bread
and
sorghum
molasses
formed
the
dessert
and
after
a
while
so
indispensable
did
the
sorghum
grow
that
we
dubbed
it
the
staff
of
life
it
was
easy
to
get
quantities
being
produced
in
dixie
kanab
besides
being
favoured
with
two
mails
a
week
had
a
telegraph
line
connecting
with
the
settlements
of
the
virgin
region
and
with
salt
lake
and
we
now
felt
that
once
more
we
had
a
grip
on
the
world
on
the
of
december
the
major
accompanied
by
captain
dodds
riley
and
one
of
the
kanab
men
john
stewart
a
son
of
the
bishop
started
for
the
kaibab
to
find
a
way
to
get
rations
to
the
colorado
next
year
near
the
mouth
of
the
little
colorado
the
weather
now
was
rather
stormy
but
continued
his
observations
as
well
as
he
could
and
parties
were
sent
out
in
a
number
of
directions
to
place
flags
and
monuments
for
the
geodetic
work
the
base
line
was
to
be
measured
south
from
near
kanab
for
about
ten
miles
christmas
day
came
with
rain
and
small
prospect
of
special
enjoyment
and
we
all
kept
the
shelter
of
the
tent
after
hunting
up
the
horses
in
mud
but
our
dinner
was
a
royal
feast
for
thompson
herself
made
a
huge
and
supplied
butter
and
milk
from
kanab
making
this
feature
of
the
holiday
an
immense
success
in
the
evening
a
number
of
us
rode
up
to
the
settlement
to
witness
a
dance
that
had
been
announced
to
take
place
in
the
schoolhouse
tabernacle
or
town
hall
the
stone
building
in
the
corner
of
the
fort
which
answered
all
these
functions
the
room
was
about
by
feet
and
was
lighted
by
three
candles
a
kerosene
lamp
and
a
blazing
fire
of
pitch
pine
two
violins
were
in
lively
operation
one
being
played
by
lyman
hamblin
a
son
of
old
jacob
and
there
was
a
refreshing
air
of
decorous
gaiety
about
the
whole
assemblage
dancing
is
a
regular
amusement
among
the
mormons
and
is
encouraged
by
the
authorities
as
a
harmless
and
beneficial
recreation
at
that
time
the
dances
were
always
opened
with
prayer
two
sets
could
occupy
the
floor
at
one
time
and
to
even
things
up
and
prevent
any
one
being
left
out
each
man
on
entering
was
given
a
number
the
numbers
being
called
in
rotation
none
of
our
party
joined
as
we
were
such
strangers
but
we
were
made
welcome
in
every
respect
it
was
ten
before
we
left
and
the
way
being
dim
and
muddy
midnight
was
on
before
we
threw
off
saddles
at
our
camp
the
next
morning
work
was
begun
on
the
base
line
but
for
some
days
the
weather
was
so
bad
that
little
was
accomplished
the
year
ended
in
this
way
and
we
hoped
the
new
one
would
be
more
propitious

dinner
with
rich
cream
for
the
coffee
which
was
an

treat

the

were

received

a

in

would

stone
covered

being
dipped
out
at

there
was

leading

it
a

might
ride
within

yards
of
this

without
noticing
its
existence
came
along
towards
night
and
the
next
day
we
went
on
eastward
to
the
top
of
the
kaibab
plateau
and
there
put
up
a
geodetic
monument
here
we
made
a
dry
camp
having
water
for
ourselves
in
a
keg
and
some
canteens
while
the
animals
got
along
very
well
as
there
was
a
little
snow
on
the
ground
proceeding
from
this
place
eastward
we
came
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
opposite
the
largest
of
a
series
of
four
or
five
peculiar
red
sandstone
peaks
the
mormons
had
explored
a
waggon
road
across
at
this
place
and
the
grades
were
easy
we
followed
the
road
and
reached
house
rock
valley
about
ten
miles
north
of
house
rock
spring
where
we
went
to
get
water
and

we
had
started
late
and
by
the
time
we
got
down
into
the
valley
darkness
had
fallen
but
a
bright
moon
compensated
for
the
absence
of
daylight
enabling
us
to
see
plainly
our
landmarks
we
jogged
along
toward
the
spring
and
i
sang
the
lone
starry
hours
give
me
when
i
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
old
thunderbolt
pack
loosening
thunderbolt
was
a
horse
that
waited
for
such
an
event
with
remarkable
docility
and
when
it
arrived
he
made
the
best
of
the
opportunity
to
get
even
with
us
for
drawing
the
so
tight
before
i
could
dismount
and
lay
hands
on
him
the
pack
slipped
back
over
his
rump
which
was
the
signal
he
watched
for
joyously
flinging
his
heels
in
the
moonlit
air
jumping
high
off
the
ground
the
next
instant
and
then
darting
off
into
the
misty
night
with
a
clatter
and
a
whirl
he
spread
the
contents
of
that
pack
to
all
points
of
the
compass
this
revenge
adequately
accomplished
we
were
permitted
to
catch
him
a
long
search
was
necessary
before
we
had
gathered
up
all
the
things
and
replaced
the
pack
on
the
now
meek
and
patient
thunderbolt
and
eight
by
the
watch
arrived
as
we
got
to
water
and
supper
we
put
up
another
station
back
of
house
rock
spring
and
spent
a
day
reconnoitring
on
sunday
january
we
went
to
red
cliff
and
made
a
camp
under
some
cedars
as
we
wished
to
put
a
station
on
the
highest
peak
the
camp
was
a
dry
one
but
we
had
the
usual
supply
of
water
in
the
keg
and
canteens
and
as
the
temperature
was
very
low
we
did
not
get
thirsty
there
was
an
abundance
of
wood
for
the
camp
but
mac
and
i
concluded
we
wanted
more
warmth
and
light
so
we
set
fire
to
two
large
cedars
that
stood
alone
and
they
made
a
superb
illumination
burning
all
night
in
the
morning
we
got
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
built
a
monument
with
a
high
pole
and
flag
to
which
to
sight
from
other
geodetic
points
while
took
observations
for
time
and
latitude
when
our
work
was
finished
we
went
back
to

arriving
just
before
sunset
in
the
morning
jones
and
i
went
across
and
climbed
the
kaibab
intending
to
put
up
a
monument
there
but
we
could
find
no
proper
site
and
returned
to
camp
and
mac
had
been
off
in
another
direction
but
they
got
in
just
before
we
had
not
finished
this
meal
when
night
having
come
on
we
heard
through
the
darkness
sounds
of
some
one
approaching
and
thirteen
navajos
one
after
the
other
came
into
the
light
of
our
fire
with
their
greeting
of
bueno
heh
and
camped
just
below
us
some
were
mounted
some
were
on
foot
the
chief
was
ashtishkal
whom
we
had
met
before
at
the
crossing
of
the
fathers
el
vado
they
were
all
friendly
and
did
not
intrude
upon
us
they
were
on
their
way
north
to
trade
with
the
mormons
having
come
across
at
the
paria
the
night
was
very
cold
and
a
heavy
dry
snow
began
to
fall
so
that
in
the
morning
when
we
arose
we
could
see
but
a
short
distance
the
navajos
about
sunrise
stood
silently
in
a
circle
till
at
a
signal
they
all
sat
down
and
began
singing
continuing
for
several
minutes
a
low
musical
refrain
and
then
all
rose
to
their
feet
again
they
left
us
early
with
friendly
demonstrations
and
went
on
their
way
towards
kanab
while
we
moved
to
another
spring
in
a
gulch
farther
up
the
valley
where
we
made
a
tent
out
of
a
pair
of
blankets
to
keep
off
the
snow
during
the
stormy
night
our
animals
started
to
leave
us
travelling
before
the
wind
but
we
suspected
their
intention
and
got
out
and
headed
them
back
much
to
their
disgust
no
doubt
thursday
january
came
bright
and
clear
but
still
extremely
cold
with
mac
started
across
the
kaibab
by
the
trail
while
jones
and
i
went
farther
north
by
the
waggon
road
referred
to
camping
near
the
station
we
had
made
on
the
way
out
the
next
morning
we
did
some
work
there
and
then
went
on
to
the
navajo
well
reaching
it
at
sunset
where
we
watered
our
stock
and
continued
by
moonlight
through
a
piercing
wind
to
spring
which
enabled
us
to
reach
our
main
camp
in
time
for
dinner
on
saturday
the
got
back
the
evening
before
at
having
made
another
station
on
the
kaibab
on
the
way
over
and
travelled
miles
about
a
mile
from
kanab
the
kaibab
band
of
pai
utes
were
encamped
and
we
had
a
good
opportunity
to
visit
them
and
study
their
ways
the
major
was
specially
interested
and
made
voluminous
notes
they
came
to
the
village
and
our
camp
a
great
deal
while
they
were
dirty
they
were
not
more
dishonest
than
white
men
so
far
as
i
could
learn
their
wickiups
about
seven
feet
high
were
merely
a
lot
of
cedar
boughs
set
around
a
circle
forming
a
conical
shelter
the
opening
towards
the
south
in
front
they
had
their
fire
with
a
or
two
and
round
about
were
their
conical
and
other
baskets
used
for
collecting
grass
seeds
piñon
nuts
and
similar
vegetable
food
which
in
addition
to
rabbits
formed
their
principal
subsistence
at
certain
times
they
all
went
to
the
kaibab
their
guns
where
they
had
any
were
of
the
old
type
with
outside
hammers
to
fire
the
caps
many
still
used
the
and
some
knew
how
to
make
stone
we
learned
the
process
which
is
not
difficult
their
clothing
was
to
some
extent
deerskin
but
mainly
old
clothes
obtained
from
the
whites
they
made
a
very
warm
robe
out
of
rabbit
skins
twisted
into
a
long
rope
and
then
sewed
side
to
side
into
the
desired
size
and
shape
but
when
we
traded
for
one
of
these
as
a
curiosity
we
placed
it
beside
a
large
ant
hill
for
some
days
before
bringing
it
into
camp
they
obtained
fire
by
the
use
of
matches
when
they
could
get
them
but
otherwise
they
used
the
single
stick
or
palm
drill
we
went
to
the
camp
one
moonlight
night
january
to
see
a
sort
of
dance
they
had
stripped
a
cedar
tree
of
all
branches
but
a
small
tuft
at
the
top
and
around
this
the
whole
band
formed
a
large
circle
dancing
and
singing
the
dancing
was
the
usual
or
lope
sideways
each
holding
hands
with
his
or
her
neighbours
in
the
centre
stood
a
man
seeming
to
be
the
custodian
of
the
songs
and
a
poet
himself
he
would
first
recite
the
piece
and
then
all
would
sing
it
circling
round
at
the
same
time
we
accepted
their
cordial
invitation
to
join
in
the
ceremony
and
had
a
lot
of
fun
out
of
our
efforts
which
greatly
amused
them
too
our
mistakes
raising
shouts
of
laughter
the
poet
seemed
to
originate
some
of
the
songs
but
they
had
others
that
were
handed
down
one
of
these
which
i
learned
later
was
this
being
translated
signifies
that
a
long
talk
is
enough
to
bore
a
hole
in
a
cliff
at
least
that
was
the
interpretation
we
obtained
another
popular
one
was
ca
shakum
poo
kai
ca
shakum
poo
kai
ca
shakum
tee
kai
ca
shakum
tee
kai
these
lines
being
repeated
like
the
others
over
and
over
and
over
again
they
were
highly
philosophical
for
they
explain
that
you
must
kill
your
rabbit
shakum
before
you
eat
him
i
do
not
remember
that
they
sang
these
particular
songs
on
that
occasion
but
they
will
serve
as
examples
on
february
the
major
left
camp
for
salt
lake
with
powell
and
the
baby
jack
went
along
to
accompany
them
as
far
as
tokerville
on
the
virgin
river
before
leaving
the
major
settled
up
with
beaman
who
was
now
to
separate
from
the
party
the
major
intended
to
go
to
washington
to
ask
congress
for
another
appropriation
to
continue
the
work
of
exploration
and
when
we
had
finished
that
already
planned
on
the
clem
and
bonnemort
arrived
from
an
expedition
to
make
photographs
down
the
kanab
canyon
where
the
major
had
been
with
riley
and
dodds
they
had
met
with
bad
luck
and
did
not
get
a
single
negative
the
silver
bath
got
out
of
order
and
the
horse
bearing
the
camera
fell
off
a
cliff
and
landed
on
top
of
the
camera
which
had
been
tied
on
the
outside
of
the
pack
with
a
result
that
need
not
be
described
bonnemort
time
was
now
up
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
prospecting
and
we
reluctantly
said
to
him
on
the
of
february
finding
our
central
camp
no
longer
practicable
we
abandoned
it
and
operated
in
small
parties
from
various
nearby
points
finally
returning
again
in
three
or
four
days
to
near
the
site
of
the
old
camp
macentee
then
wanted
to
go
to
prospecting
also
and
he
departed
he
was
an
interesting
companionable
young
man
educated
at
the
university
of
michigan
seeking
a
fortune
and
he
was
desirous
of
striking
it
rich
whether
he
ever
did
or
not
i
have
not
learned
while
camped
below
kanab
clem
and
i
in
walking
one
day
saw
a
place
where
the
creek
which
flowed
on
a
level
with
the
surroundings
suddenly
plunged
into
a
deep
mud
canyon
this
canyon
had
been
cut
back
from
far
below
by
the
undermining
action
of
the
falling
water
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
it
would
continue
its
retrogression
till
it
eventually
reached
the
mouth
of
the
great
canyon
several
miles
above
but
i
did
not
dream
that
it
could
accomplish
this
work
as
rapidly
as
it
actually
did
years
after
during
a
great
flood
it
washed
a
canyon
not
only
to
kanab
but
for
miles
up
the
gorge
sweeping
away
at
one
master
stroke
hundreds
of
acres
of
arable
land
and
leaving
a
mud
chasm
forty
feet
deep
had
the
fall
we
examined
been
arranged
then
so
that
the
water
might
glide
down
the
fearful
washout
would
not
have
occurred
there
are
thousands
of
places
in
the
west
that
require
treatment
to
conserve
arable
land
and
in
time
the
task
may
be
undertaken
by
the
government
cap
health
being
such
that
he
deemed
it
inadvisable
to
continue
work
in
the
field
he
had
severed
his
connection
with
the
expedition
after
finishing
the
preliminary
map
of
green
river
and
was
temporarily
settled
in
kanab
where
he
had
been
for
some
time
on
wednesday
february
thompson
and
i
took
supper
with
him
in
one
of
the
log
houses
at
the
fort
and
on
the
several
of
us
accepted
his
invitation
to
dinner
a
sort
of
farewell
for
on
the
following
day
we
started
with
our
whole
outfit
for
the
kaibab
we
were
extremely
sorry
to
lose
cap
with
his
generous
spirit
and
cheery
ways
but
when
one
has
been
punctured
by
a
he
has
to
heed
warnings
all
day
long
we
travelled
through
sandy
hills
gradually
rising
toward
the
plateau
the
of
which
we
reached
late
in
the
afternoon
we
had
followed
a
waggon
road
with
our
up
to
this
point
but
here
we
struck
off
on
a
trail
that
was
said
to
be
a
shorter
way
to
the
canyon
we
were
aiming
for
and
a
little
before
sunset
we
came
to
the
brink
of
a
steep
slope
almost
a
cliff
where
a
picturesque
a
romantic
view
opened
before
us
below
stretched
away
to
the
south
a
narrow
deep
and
sharply
defined
valley
or
canyon
mile
wide
the
bottom
of
which
seemed
perfectly
flat
a
light
snow
which
had
fallen
the
night
before
whitened
the
sharp
slopes
but
from
the
valley
bottom
it
had
melted
away
leaving
a
clear
line
of
demarkation
on
either
side
and
producing
an
extremely
beautiful
effect
under
the
evening
glow
tall
pine
trees
accented
the
scene
which
was
one
of
the
most
inviting
i
had
ever
beheld
one
of
our
helpers
from
kanab
had
been
over
the
trail
and
led
us
down
to
a
small
but
excellent
spring
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
which
we
camped
passing
a
most
comfortable
night
before
we
had
finished
slinging
the
last
pack
in
the
morning
a
heavy
grey
sky
began
to
sift
down
thickly
falling
snowflakes
gently
as
if
not
wishing
to
give
alarm
but
when
we
were
fairly
under
way
this
mildness
vanished
and
the
storm
smote
our
caravan
with
fierce
and
blinding
gusts
amidst
which
progress
was
difficult
after
four
miles
up
the
valley
through
beautiful
pine
trees
of
great
height
we
came
to
a
deserted
log
cabin
only
half
roofed
over
and
there
we
stopped
to
make
our
temporary
headquarters
the
stewarts
of
kanab
had
started
a
at
this
place
but
as
yet
the
work
had
not
gone
very
far
the
snow
ceased
by
the
time
we
had
thrown
off
the
packs
and
we
made
ourselves
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
permitted
had
a
tent
put
up
for
thompson
while
some
took
possession
of
the
house
for
by
keeping
on
the
side
where
the
board
cover
was
they
were
slightly
sheltered
with
two
or
three
of
the
others
i
pitched
a
small
tent
there
was
plenty
of
fat
pine
and
rousing
fires
made
the
valley
seem
habitable
a
fine
little
brook
swept
full
grown
fifteen
inches
in
diameter
from
under
a
cliff
two
hundred
feet
above
the
valley
bottom
and
there
was
no
lack
of
good
water
our
trouble
was
with
the
horses
and
mules
for
we
had
no
grain
for
them
and
if
the
snow
got
very
deep
they
would
not
be
able
to
paw
down
to
the
bunch
grass
the
snow
soon
began
again
and
all
night
it
fell
with
aggravating
facility
sunday
morning
opened
as
leaden
and
dark
as
a
february
day
could
be
and
there
was
no
cessation
of
the
showers
of
whiteness
that
were
rapidly
building
up
on
the
ground
a
formidable
barrier
to
our
operations
as
i
was
wearing
rather
low
brogans
having
discarded
as
too
and
uncomfortable
around
camp
i
now
made
for
myself
a
pair
of
leggins
out
of
pieces
of
a
common
but
heavy
seamless
sack
when
these
were
buttoned
in
place
they
answered
perfectly
to
protect
my
legs
from
the
snow
we
hoped
monday
would
begin
the
week
with
a
clear
sky
but
we
were
disappointed
we
had
to
sally
out
to
hunt
horses
hoping
at
the
same
time
to
come
across
a
deer
but
that
hope
was
not
realised
as
i
got
far
from
camp
in
the
midst
of
the
tall
pines
and
the
unbroken
snow
sheet
i
suddenly
became
aware
of
a
whispering
sound
which
i
could
not
at
first
account
for
as
i
did
not
believe
in
fairies
standing
perfectly
still
i
perceived
that
it
was
produced
by
the
friction
of
the
snowflakes
upon
the
pine
needles
it
was
a
weird
language
which
i
had
never
listened
to
before
went
up
one
thousand
feet
on
the
mountain
and
climbed
a
tree
feet
high
with
a
determination
to
see
something
in
spite
of
the
snow
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
south
wall
of
the
grand
canyon
near
mt
trumbull
miles
to
the
west
on
tuesday
he
started
george
adair
one
of
our
mormon
assistants
back
to
kanab
for
more
rations
and
directed
jones
and
captain
dodds
to
get
ready
to
start
the
next
day
for
the
corner
of
the
plateau
while
andy
and
i
were
to
go
to
the
corner
wednesday
february
came
clear
with
the
snow
lying
twelve
inches
on
the
level
but
some
of
the
horses
were
missing
and
the
day
was
spent
in
hunting
this
wayward
stock
so
it
was
not
till
thursday
afternoon
that
we
got
started
our
paths
lying
for
a
distance
in
the
same
direction
we
four
travelled
together
along
a
divide
on
the
right
or
west
of
camp
it
was
slow
work
in
the
deep
drifts
and
we
had
not
made
many
miles
when
night
came
on
we
went
into
camp
where
we
were
the
horses
bothered
us
by
trying
to
go
back
searching
for
grass
and
nobody
could
blame
them
finally
we
tied
the
worst
offender
to
a
tree
in
a
bare
place
where
he
might
pick
up
a
few
mouthfuls
of
food
and
we
managed
to
sleep
the
rest
of
the
night
the
only
sound
i
heard
when
i
woke
up
at
one
time
was
the
satirical
voice
of
an
owl
in
the
far
distance
it
seemed
to
be
saying
very
deliberately
and
that
did
not
sound
respectful
the
next
morning
was
march
and
it
brought
a
fine
sky
which
would
have
put
us
quickly
on
the
way
or
rather
in
motion
toward
our
respective
goals
as
there
was
no
road
or
trail
but
one
of
our
animals
which
bore
the
mysterious
name
of
yawger
and
which
was
the
of
andy
and
me
could
not
be
found
jones
and
dodds
went
on
as
they
would
probably
soon
have
to
separate
from
us
anyhow
while
we
took
yawger
track
and
at
last
found
him
browsing
happily
in
a
bare
spot
about
a
mile
from
our
stopping
place
it
was
two
by
the
time
we
started
on
floundering
through
the
drifts
in
the
trail
of
jones
and
dodds
some
drifts
were
so
high
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
wallow
through
them
even
after
the
others
had
in
a
measure
broken
the
way
after
two
hours
of
hard
work
in
this
line
we
came
to
the
edge
of
a
wide
gully
where
the
advance
party
had
halted
the
slope
was
towards
the
south
and
the
ground
was
somewhat
bare
with
good
bunch
grass
where
the
other
horses
were
feeding
while
jones
and
dodds
were
just
descending
from
a
tall
pine
tree
they
declared
nothing
but
snow
could
be
seen
in
all
directions
on
the
mountain
and
they
were
going
back
besides
it
was
impossible
they
told
me
to
cross
the
gulch
ahead
i
did
not
want
to
turn
back
till
i
was
compelled
to
and
i
appealed
to
andy
as
to
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
give
up
not
wishing
to
drag
him
along
unwillingly
with
his
characteristic
nonchalance
he
said
go
ahead
if
you
want
to
dodds
had
one
of
his
own
horses
with
him
and
he
said
he
would
bet
me
that
horse
i
could
not
cross
the
gulch
i
made
a
trial
wading
ahead
of
my
horse
the
pack
animal
following
and
andy
driving
from
behind
when
i
got
into
the
middle
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
move
but
i
continued
my
efforts
till
suddenly
the
bottom
seemed
to
rise
and
then
in
a
few
yards
the
going
grew
easier
and
we
emerged
triumphantly
on
the
other
side
where
we
waved
an
adieu
to
the
others
by
keeping
close
to
the
boles
of
the
large
pine
trees
where
the
wind
had
swept
circular
places
leaving
the
snow
shallow
we
were
soon
out
of
sight
of
our
late
companions
after
two
or
three
miles
of
tiring
work
the
day
began
to
fade
but
we
reached
a
beautiful
south
slope
where
there
was
little
snow
with
a
rich
crop
of
bunch
grass
just
starting
green
under
the
vernal
influence
that
was
a
feast
for
the
famished
horses
the
snow
relieving
their
thirst
while
andy
the
got
supper
i
reconnoitred
and
made
up
my
mind
that
i
could
reach
the
locality
i
was
trying
for
by
following
a
ridge
i
saw
ahead
where
the
snow
seemed
moderate
we
were
up
and
off
early
the
snow
was
deep
but
we
got
on
quite
rapidly
and
finally
reached
the
ridge
crossing
two
big
gulches
to
get
to
it
at
eleven
we
were
at
the
end
of
its
summit
and
i
could
see
a
wide
area
to
the
west
and
north
the
point
appeared
to
be
one
of
several
similar
projections
though
the
one
we
were
on
was
the
most
prominent
i
selected
a
spot
for
a
monument
where
we
dug
a
hole
in
the
rocks
and
dirt
and
then
cutting
a
tall
slim
pine
and
trimming
it
clean
we
hitched
yawger
to
it
and
made
him
drag
it
to
the
hole
where
by
a
combination
of
science
and
strength
we
got
it
upright
while
andy
who
had
great
strength
lifted
and
pushed
after
we
had
together
got
it
half
way
i
propped
it
with
a
strong
pole
with
a
y
on
the
end
and
in
a
few
moments
we
saw
the
flag
waving
triumphantly
from
its
tip
at
least
thirty
feet
above
our
heads
around
its
base
we
piled
the
rocks
which
were
exceptionally
heavy
waist
high
first
cutting
a
notch
in
the
pine
and
placing
therein
a
can
containing
a
record
and
our
point
f
was
finished
the
rest
of
the
day
i
spent
in
triangulating
to
various
other
stations
and
we
went
to
bed
under
a
clear
sky
and
a
milder
atmosphere
in
the
morning
i
completed
my
triangulating
work
and
by
that
time
the
snow
had
settled
and
melted
so
that
the
back
track
was
much
easier
than
the
outward
march
enabling
us
to
get
to
headquarters
at
the
spring
before
dark
i
had
been
a
little
afraid
that
a
heavy
snow
would
come
on
top
of
the
large
drifts
which
would
have
held
us
prisoners
for
a
day
or
two
on
wednesday
march
the
whole
party
packed
up
and
left
the
valley
by
its
narrow
canyon
outlet
a
tributary
of
the
kanab
canyon
it
began
eight
hundred
feet
deep
and
continually
increased
we
called
it
shinumo
canyon
because
we
found
everywhere
indications
of
the
former
presence
of
that
tribe
snow
fell
at
intervals
and
we
were
alternately
frozen
and
melted
till
we
reached
an
altitude
where
the
warmth
was
continuous
and
the
snow
became
rain
grass
fresh
and
green
and
shrubs
with
the
feeling
of
early
spring
surrounded
us
at
the
junction
with
kanab
canyon
where
the
walls
were
twelve
hundred
feet
high
a
mile
below
we
camped
by
a
lone
cedar
tree
where
there
were
pockets
of
in
the
rocks
the
next
day
our
course
was
laid
up
kanab
canyon
through
thick
willows
that
pulled
the
packs
loose
one
horse
fell
upside
down
in
a
gully
but
he
was
not
hurt
and
we
pried
him
out
and
went
on
camping
near
a
large
pool
of
intensely
alkaline
water
on
the
going
up
a
branch
on
the
left
called
pipe
spring
wash
we
came
out
on
the
surface
very
much
as
one
might
reach
a
second
floor
by
a
staircase
this
is
a
feature
of
the
country
and
as
one
goes
northward
he
arrives
on
successive
platforms
in
this
manner
passing
through
the
several
cliff
ranges
by
means
of
transverse
gorges
that
usually
begin
in
small
box
canyons
and
rapidly
deepen
till
they
reach
the
full
height
of
the
cliff
walls
at
two
we
came
to
pipe
spring
a
vacant
stone
house
of
one
very
large
room
and
a
great
fireplace
was
put
at
our
disposal
by
winsor
the
proprietor
and
it
was
occupied
by
the
men
while
had
a
tent
put
up
for
thompson
we
found
a
party
of
miners
here
who
had
heard
of
the
gold
discovery
at
the
mouth
of
the
kanab
on
the
colorado
and
were
heading
that
way
to
reap
the
they
were
soon
followed
by
hundreds
more
making
a
steady
stream
down
the
narrow
kanab
and
out
again
for
some
time
for
on
reaching
the
river
the
limited
opportunity
to
do
any
mining
was
at
once
apparent
and
they
immediately
took
the
back
track
swearing
vengeance
on
the
originator
of
the
story
for
protection
against
raiders
winsor
was
building
a
solid
double
house
of
blocks
of
sandstone
making
walls
three
feet
thick
the
two
buildings
were
placed
about
twenty
feet
apart
thus
forming
an
interior
court
the
length
of
the
houses
protected
at
the
ends
by
high
walls
and
heavy
gates
no
windows
opened
on
the
exterior
but
there
were
plenty
of
loopholes
commanding
every
approach
a
fine
large
spring
was
conducted
subterraneously
into
the
corner
of
one
of
the
buildings
and
out
again
insuring
plenty
of
water
in
case
of
a
siege
brigham
young
was
part
owner
of
this
establishment
and
it
was
one
of
the
most
effective
places
of
defence
on
a
small
scale
that
i
have
ever
seen
it
was
never
needed
so
far
as
i
have
heard
and
even
at
the
time
i
marvelled
that
it
should
be
so
elaborately
prepared
far
beyond
anything
else
in
the
whole
country
the
cut
opposite
shows
this
fort
as
it
was
in
clem
here
told
he
did
not
care
to
stay
with
us
any
longer
ill
success
with
his
photographs
had
discouraged
him
but
persuaded
him
to
remain
for
a
time
until
march
we
operated
around
pipe
spring
triangulating
and
recording
the
topography
and
other
data
when
we
packed
our
animals
again
and
laid
our
course
across
the
open
country
towards
a
range
of
blue
mountains
seen
in
the
one
of
these
had
been
named
after
senator
trumbull
by
the
major
in
the
autumn
of
they
were
the
home
of
the
uinkarets
and
we
called
the
whole
group
by
that
name
discarding
north
side
mountains
the
name
ives
had
given
when
he
sighted
them
in
from
far
to
the
south
adjoining
the
uinkaret
region
on
the
west
was
the
shewits
territory
where
the
howlands
and
dunn
were
killed
travelling
across
the
dry
plains
we
came
to
a
well
defined
trail
about
sunset
and
followed
it
hoping
that
it
would
lead
to
water
we
were
not
disappointed
for
it
took
us
to
a
pool
of
in
a
little
gulley
at
the
foot
of
some
low
hills
a
band
of
wild
horses
roamed
the
plain
and
as
we
had
been
told
about
a
pool
called
the
wild
band
pocket
we
had
no
doubt
this
was
the
place
there
was
no
wood
anywhere
but
a
diligent
search
produced
enough
small
brush
to
cook
by
though
andy
had
a
hard
time
of
it
clem
horse
ran
away
from
him
and
lost
his
gun
so
he
remained
behind
at
pipe
spring
to
hunt
for
the
weapon

the
next
day
we
travelled
on
over
hilly
country
following
a
moccasin
trail
with
here
and
there
cedar
groves
as
we
approached
nearer
to
the
mountains
on
the
edge
of
night
traces
of
water
were
found
in
a
gulch
near
the
foot
of
trumbull
and
while
jack
and
a
new
member
of
our
force
will
johnson
of
kanab
dug
for
more
jones
and
i
scoured
the
vicinity
in
search
of
a
spring
or
pocket
but
though
we
found
many
old
wickiups
there
was
no
water
the
uinkarets
had
evidently
camped
here
in
wet
weather
when
we
returned
we
were
told
that
the
little
trace
of
water
in
the
gulch
had
disappeared
completely
after
the
digging
a
sad
development
which
was
accepted
by
all
but
one
old
white
horse
which
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
hole
for
an
hour
or
more
patiently
waiting
our
kegs
and
canteens
provided
enough
to
make
bread
which
we
ate
with
sorghum
and
as
early
as
possible
in
the
morning
we
pushed
on
without
breakfast
three
men
scouting
ahead
to
discover
the
pool
where
the
major
in
the
autumn
of
had
camped
finally
found
it
a
large
pool
of
about
a
hundred
barrels
of
clear
clean
water
in
a
lava
gulch
surrounded
by
cedar
and
piñon
trees
andy
then
gave
us
breakfast
and
dinner
at
the
same
time
eleven
another
new
member
of
our
party
was
beaman
successor
fennemore
from
salt
lake
who
had
joined
us
at
pipe
spring
on
march
and
he
was
prepared
to
photograph
the
region
we
reconnoitred
the
neighbourhood
during
the
afternoon
and
the
next
morning
jones
and
i
rode
in
one
direction
around
mount
trumbull
while
and
captain
dodds
rode
the
other
way
to
ascertain
the
lay
of
the
land
and
especially
to
find
a
ranch
which
some
george
men
had
started
in
this
locality
jones
and
i
met
whitmore
the
proprietor
of
the
ranch
and
a
friend
of
his
who
informed
us
the
ranch
was
six
miles
farther
on
we
concluded
not
to
go
to
it
but
when
and
captain
dodds
got
in
after
dark
they
told
us
they
had
gone
the
whole
way
the
following
day
monday
march
all
the
party
except
andy
and
a
new
member
alf
young
of
kanab
climbed
to
the
summit
of
mount
trumbull
finding
the
ascent
very
gradual
and
easy
and
taking
the
horses
to
the
top
which
was
feet
above
the
pool
and
above
sea
level
commanding
a
magnificent
view
in
every
direction
as
far
to
the
as
mount
san
francisco
jones
jack
fennemore
and
i
remained
there
all
night
while
the
rest
returned
to
camp
jones
and
i
wanted
to
do
some
topographical
work
and
get
sights
to
some
of
our
other
stations
and
fennemore
assisted
by
jack
wanted
pictures
descending
the
opposite
side
the
next
day
we
went
to
a
spring
in
an
oak
grove
which
had
seen
where
the
others
were
already
encamped
on
the
and
i
climbed
a
high
cinder
peak
of
which
there
were
many
to
get
a
view
and
then
went
to
whitmore
ranch
where
we
had
a
talk
with
him
to
get
points
on
the
region
he
told
us
he
had
followed
a
trail
to
the
colorado
about
twelve
miles
to
what
he
called
the
ute
crossing
if
i
remember
correctly
he
had
taken
a
horse
down
at
that
point
the
next
day
johnson
and
i
put
a
signal
flag
on
one
of
the
high
mountains
afterwards
named
logan
forming
signal
station
number
this
was
a
volcanic
district
and
there
were
many
old
craters
near
the
oak
spring
camp
was
an
extensive
sheet
of
lava
seeming
to
have
cooled
but
a
year
or
two
before
its
surface
was
all
fractured
but
there
were
no
trees
on
its
lower
extremity
and
where
it
had
flowed
around
a
hill
its
recent
plasticity
was
exceedingly
distinct
it
had
come
from
a
crater
about
five
hundred
feet
high
two
miles
north
this
had
once
been
a
cone
but
it
was
now
disrupted
the
lava
having
burst
through
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
leaving
two
sections
standing
the
stream
to
the
south
being
one
quarter
mile
wide
and
a
mile
and
a
half
long
that
on
the
north
one
mile
wide
and
about
the
same
in
length
the
depth
of
these
streams
was
not
far
from
thirty
feet
and
in
spite
of
the
exceedingly
rugged
surface
the
southern
stream
was
marked
by
deeply
worn
trails
running
to
and
from
a
small
spring
situated
in
the
middle
of
it
beside
this
spring
one
of
the
men
from
the
ranch
had
found
a
human
skeleton
covered
with
fragments
of
lava
with
the
decayed
remains
of
a
wicker
between
the
ribs
marking
some
unrecorded
tragedy
we
estimated
that
less
than
three
hundred
years
had
passed
since
the
last
outburst
from
the
crater
as
there
were
pine
trees
a
hundred
years
old
on
the
lava
where
it
was
more
disintegrated
near
the
point
of
outpour
the
age
of
the
flow
could
not
have
been
less
than
that
friday
the
being
cloudy
and
stormy
nothing
in
the
line
of
geodetic
work
was
done
and
we
could
only
rest
in
camp
dodds
and
jones
who
had
gone
to
explore
a
way
to
the
grand
canyon
came
in
reporting
success
saturday
morning
jones
and
fennemore
started
for
kanab
to
bring
out
more
rations
and
meet
us
either
at
fort
pierce
or
at
berry
spring
near
george
while
with
dodds
and
johnson
went
to
try
to
follow
the
trail
whitmore
had
told
about
to
the
river
but
after
four
miles
they
gave
it
up
and
climbed
by
a
side
trail
to
the
plateau
again
they
made
a
dry
camp
and
the
next
day
went
on
till
they
found
water
enough
for
the
horses
in
some
pools
on
the
rocks
and
here
leaving
the
others
to
continue
the
reconnaissance
came
back
to
our
camp
arriving
in
a
it
had
been
snowing
with
us
at
intervals
all
day
the
next
day
was
april
first
and
with
it
came
still
heavier
snow
we
planned
to
move
down
to
the
edge
of
the
grand
canyon
and
jack
and
andy
started
as
jack
wished
to
make
some
photographs
there
but
the
snow
continuing
we
concluded
to
wait
till
another
day
when
that
came
the
snow
was
quite
deep
on
the
ground
and
was
still
falling
hard
which
it
continued
to
do
most
of
the
time
preventing
us
from
moving
fennemore
had
brought
with
him
a
copy
of
count
of
monte
which
i
had
never
read
and
in
its
pages
i
soon
became
oblivious
to
the
surroundings
the
snow
kept
on
the
next
day
also
and
all
the
men
out
returned
to
the
main
camp
dodds
and
johnson
having
reached
the
river
bank
when
another
morning
dawned
and
showed
no
cessation
of
the
aggravating
storm
with
the
snow
fifteen
inches
on
the
level
said
he
would
pack
up
friday
the
and
get
down
to
lower
country
around
george
the
day
came
clear
and
sunny
and
the
snow
began
to
melt
we
headed
for
the
pine
valley
mountains
back
of
george
and
made
about
twenty
miles
with
no
snow
after
the
first
six
the
altitude
dropping
to
where
the
temperature
was
milder
had
inquired
at
the
ranch
about
trails
but
there
were
so
many
cattle
trails
that
we
did
not
get
on
the
right
one
we
made
a
dry
camp
and
early
the
following
morning
went
on
not
being
able
to
see
any
landmarks
because
of
the
clouds
half
an
hour
after
starting
a
thick
set
in
but
we
kept
going
till
in
about
a
mile
and
a
half
the
world
seemed
suddenly
to
end
above
below
and
around
us
was
a
great
blank
whiteness
dismounting
and
cautiously
advancing
on
foot
we
discovered
that
we
were
on
the
brink
of
a
very
high
cliff
as
we
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
we
threw
off
the
packs
and
stopped
where
we
were
spreading
out
blankets
we
scraped
the
snow
from
them
into
the
kettles
to
melt
for
water
then
by
holding
a
blanket
up
over
andy
by
the
four
corners
he
was
able
with
some
chips
he
had
previously
chopped
out
of
the
side
of
a
dead
pine
to
start
a
fire
by
which
he
proceeded
to
cook
dinner
when
the
snow
fell
less
heavily
we
could
peer
down
and
then
saw
that
the
cliff
was
continuous
in
both
directions
by
two
with
our
kegs
and
canteens
filled
with
the
snow
water
we
were
again
on
the
way
following
along
to
find
a
place
to
go
down
but
we
saw
none
that
seemed
practicable
and
at
last
having
made
altogether
five
miles
we
halted
for
the
night
in
a
grove
of
cedars
where
we
had
a
good
fire
and
were
comfortable
though
our
rations
were
now
growing
scarce
snow
at
intervals
continued
all
day
up
to
bedtime
the
next
day
was
sunday
we
travelled
twenty
miles
along
the
line
of
cliffs
and
camped
near
a
canyon
in
which
we
found
pools
of
good
water
we
saw
an
antelope
during
the
day
but
could
not
get
it
andy
baked
up
the
last
of
our
flour
for
supper
and
put
on
a
pot
of
beans
and
one
of
dried
peaches
to
cook
for
breakfast
the
beans
were
edible
in
the
morning
and
we
disposed
of
them
and
the
peaches
and
went
on
our
way
after
a
day
of
many
ups
and
downs
we
arrived
about
two
at
a
ranch
called
gould
or
workman
where
we
bought
five
dollars
worth
of
and
milk
we
were
now
on
what
the
inhabitants
of
the
region
called
hurricane
hill
and
from
this
we
applied
the
name
hurricane
ledge
to
the
long
line
of
sharp
cliffs
we
had
followed
which
begin
at
the
virgin
river
and
extend
almost
unbroken
and
eight
hundred
to
a
thousand
feet
high
south
to
the
grand
canyon
forming
the
western
boundary
of
the
uinkaret
plateau
from
gould
we
had
a
waggon
road
and
following
it
we
were
led
to
the
brink
of
the
hurricane
ledge
where
a
road
had
been
constructed
to
the
bottom
before
descending
we
took
a
final
look
at
the
enchanting
view
opening
away
to
the
north
and
at
our
feet
was
the
virgin
valley
with
the
green
fields
of
tokerville
while
beyond
rose
magnificent
cliffs
culminating
to
the
in
the
giant
buttes
and
precipices
of
the
mookoontoweap
or
as
the
mormons
call
it
little
zion
valley
topping
the
whole
sweep
of
magnificent
kaleidoscopic
topography
were
the
pine
valley
mountains
and
the
lofty
cliffs
of
the
colob
and
markargunt
plateaus
it
has
ever
since
been
my
opinion
that
few
outlooks
in
all
the
world
are
superior
for
colour
and
form
to
that
stretching
north
from
the
northern
part
of
the
hurricane
ledge
descending
to
the
valley
we
arrived
just
at
dusk
at
berry
spring
where
our
waggon
under
the
direction
of
jones
had
come
with
supplies
the
spring
was
an
excellent
one
and
the
rivulet
flowing
away
from
it
was
bordered
with
large
bushes
though
the
waggon
and
supplies
were
there
jones
was
not
for
we
had
expected
to
come
in
from
farther
west
past
fort
pierce
and
he
had
gone
on
to
that
place
to
tell
us
where
he
had
decided
to
camp
clem
had
found
his
gun
and
come
out
with
them
the
others
of
the
party
being
fennemore
and
george
adair
jones
came
back
the
next
day
and
prepared
to
start
with
andy
and
johnson
for
several
days
work
in
the
pine
valley
mountains
while
jack
captain
dodds
fennemore
and
i
were
to
return
to
the
uinkaret
region
to
complete
certain
work
there
some
goods
to
be
distributed
to
the
natives
from
the
indian
bureau
arrived
at
george
and
went
there
with
george
adair
to
have
a
talk
with
the
indians
to
be
found
and
distribute
goods
we
had
seen
no
indians
at
all
in
the
uinkaret
region
he
discovered
the
shewits
who
came
in
to
be
afraid
of
us
thinking
we
wanted
to
kill
them
but
they
were
willing
to
accept
anything
they
could
get
in
the
line
of
presents
hardly
any
would
acknowledge
themselves
to
be
either
uinkarets
or
shewits
on
april
according
to
the
plan
jack
dodds
fennemore
and
i
started
back
to
the
uinkaret
mountains
following
the
trail
we
had
tried
to
strike
coming
out
it
led
past
a
place
called
fort
pierce
a
small
stone
building
the
settlers
had
formerly
used
as
an
advance
post
against
the
shewits
and
uinkarets
there
we
spent
the
night
and
the
next
day
after
some
trouble
we
got
on
the
right
trail
and
on
monday
the
of
april
we
again
reached
what
we
had
called
oak
spring
near
mount
trumbull
and
the
southern
flow
of
lava
already
described
the
following
day
jack
and
fennemore
went
down
to
the
brink
of
the
grand
canyon
at
the
foot
of
a
sort
of
valley
the
uinkarets
called
toroweap
while
with
dodds
i
climbed
the
peak
later
named
after
senator
logan
and
attempted
some
triangulation
but
the
air
was
so
murky
i
could
not
get
my
sights
and
had
to
return
for
them
the
next
morning
the
day
after
that
we
climbed
mount
trumbull
and
i
triangulated
from
there
one
of
my
sights
from
logan
was
to
a
conical
butte
near
which
we
had
camped
as
we
came
out
and
near
which
we
had
found
a
large
covered
with
small
perfect
quartz
crystals
that
sparkled
in
the
sun
like
diamonds
when
i
sighted
to
this
butte
for
want
of
a
better
name
i
recorded
it
temporarily
as
diamond
butte
remembering
the
crystals
and
the
name
became
fixed
which
shows
how
unintentionally
names
are
sometimes
bestowed
we
examined
the
lava
flows
and
the
crater
again
and
i
made
a
sketch
in
pencil
from
another
point
of
view
from
one
i
had
made
during
our
former
sojourn
then
we
joined
jack
and
fennemore
who
had
been
taking
negatives
at
the
canyon
edge
on
the
dodds
and
i
climbed
down
the
cliffs
about
three
thousand
feet
to
the
water
at
a
rapid
called
lava
falls
across
the
river
we
could
see
a
very
large
spring
but
of
course
we
could
not
get
over
to
it
returning
to
oak
spring
we
spent
there
another
night
and
in
the
morning
while
the
others
started
for
headquarters
i
rode
around
to
the
ranch
to
inquire
about
a
spring
i
had
heard
something
about
existing
on
the
george
trail
but
the
solitary
man
i
found
there
who
came
out
of
the
woods
in
response
to
my
shout
a
walking
arsenal
did
not
know
anything
concerning
it
after
drinking
a
quart
or
two
of
milk
which
he
kindly
offered
me
i
rode
on
to
join
my
companions
by
continuing
around
the
mountain
running
in
the
trail
as
i
went
with
a
prismatic
compass
presently
i
saw
a
cougar
sitting
upright
behind
a
big
log
calmly
staring
at
me
so
i
dismounted
and
sent
a
winchester
bullet
in
his
direction
my
mule
was
highly
nervous
about
firearms
and
having
to
restrain
her
antics
by
putting
my
arm
through
the
bridle
rein
her
snorting
skittishness
both
at
the
rifle
and
the
cougar
disturbed
my
aim
and
my
shot
went
a
trifle
under
the
bullet
seemed
to
clip
the
log
but
if
it
hit
the
cougar
the
effect
was
not
what
i
expected
for
with
a
rush
like
a
the
animal
disappeared
in
the
top
of
the
pine
tree
overhead
and
i
could
see
nothing
more
of
it
though
i
rode
about
looking
for
it
not
wishing
to
dally
here
i
spurred
on
to
overtake
my
party
but
in
trying
a
short
cut
i
passed
beyond
them
as
they
had
by
that
time
halted
in
some
cedars
for
lunch
the
man
at
the
ranch
had
told
me
that
whitmore
was
due
to
arrive
that
day
and
having
missed
a
part
of
the
trail
by
the
short
cut
i
could
not
judge
by
the
tracks
as
to
where
my
party
were
and
not
caring
to
waste
time
i
rode
on
and
on
till
i
had
gone
so
far
i
did
not
want
to
turn
back
evening
came
but
there
was
a
good
moon
and
i
did
not
stop
till
eight
the
night
was
cold
the
plain
was
barren
and
bleak
i
had
no
coat
but
with
the
saddle
blanket
and
a
handful
of
dead
brush
which
i
burned
by
installments
i
managed
to
warm
myself
enough
to
sleep
by
short
intervals
i
was
on
my
feet
with
the
dawn
but
my
mule
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
though
i
had
hoppled
her
well
with
my
bridle
reins
i
tracked
the
mule
about
five
miles
to
a
muddy
place
where
there
had
been
water
caught
her
and
rode
back
to
my
saddle
when
i
continued
my
journey
running
in
the
trail
as
i
went
i
became
pretty
thirsty
and
hungry
but
the
only
thing
for
me
to
do
was
to
continue
to
our
main
camp
had
i
gone
back
i
might
have
missed
our
men
again
for
there
had
been
some
talk
about
a
trail
and
i
feared
they
might
try
it
at
two
i
reached
black
rock
canyon
where
there
was
a
full
of
warm
and
dirty
water
but
both
the
mule
and
i
took
a
drink
and
i
rode
on
passing
fort
pierce
at
sunset
off
on
my
right
i
perceived
ten
or
twelve
shewits
indians
on
foot
travelling
rapidly
along
in
indian
file
and
as
the
darkness
fell
and
i
had
to
go
through
some
wooded
gulches
i
confess
i
was
a
little
uncomfortable
and
kept
my
rifle
in
readiness
but
i
was
not
molested
and
reached
camp
about
ten
where
i
ate
a
large
piece
of
bread
with
molasses
after
a
good
drink
of
water
and
went
to
bed
the
others
arrived
the
following
afternoon
i
had
left
notes
for
them
by
the
trail
in
so
they
knew
that
i
was
ahead
this
was
the
longest
trip
i
ever
made
without
water
or
food
we
prepared
to
start
out
again
in
different
directions
one
party
was
to
go
to
the
pine
valley
mountains
another
to
pipe
spring
and
the
mouth
of
the
paria
to
look
after
our
property
there
a
third
up
the
virgin
valley
for
photographs
and
a
fourth
to
george
and
the
virgin
range
of
mountains
of
that
town
headed
this
last
party
and
he
took
me
as
his
topographical
assistant
april
we
rode
into
george
a
town
i
was
much
interested
to
see
i
found
a
very
pretty
neat
little
city
of
about
fifteen
hundred
population
with
a
good
schoolhouse
a
stone
tabernacle
with
a
spire
and
a
court
house
the
water
running
in
ditches
along
the
streets
for
irrigating
purposes
as
well
as
for
drinking
about
a
mile
below
the
town
we
camped
and
we
could
hear
the
band
playing
a
serenade
to
one
of
the
officials
who
was
to
start
the
next
day
on
a
long
journey
after
several
days
of
feeling
our
way
about
in
the
rugged
and
dry
region
below
george
we
finally
discovered
a
good
from
which
and
i
made
a
long
hard
ride
and
climb
and
about
sunset
camped
at
the
base
of
what
is
now
called
mount
bangs
the
highest
peak
of
the
virgin
mountains
for
which
we
were
aiming
the
next
day
we
climbed
an
additional
eleven
hundred
feet
to
its
summit
and
completed
our
work
in
time
by
swift
riding
to
get
to
our
main
camp
at
the
by
six
it
was
an
easy
trip
back
to
george
following
an
old
trail
and
then
we
made
our
way
to
kanab
again
where
we
put
all
our
notes
in
shape
and
fitted
out
for
the
journey
to
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil

the

andy
and

who
had
gone
to
the
mouth
of
the
paria
to
ascertain
the
condition
of
our
boats
returned
may
reporting
the
boats
all
right
but
the
caches
we
had
left
torn
up
by
wolves
and
prospectors
the
latter
had
stolen
oars
and
other
things
and
gone
down
on
a
raft
to
be
wrecked
at
the
first
rapid
in
marble
canyon
where
they
just
escaped
with
their
lives
a
settler
had
established
himself
there
a
short
time
before
the
notorious
john
lee
who
was
reputed
to
have
led
the
massacre
of
the
unfortunate
missourians
at
mountain
meadows
in
and
who
had
eluded
capture
all
these
years
he
had
been
cut
off
nominally
at
least
from
the
mormon
church
and
had
lived
in
the
most
places
constantly
on
his
guard
our
men
took
all
our
ropes
and
remaining
materials
from
the
caches
to
his
cabin
where
they
would
be
safe
till
our
arrival
we
prepared
for
the
trip
eastward
across
the
unknown
country
to
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
river
and
by
the
of
may
i
had
completed
the
preliminary
map
of
the
region
to
westward
which
we
had
just
reconnoitred
thompson
was
to
stay
in
kanab
for
decided
that
it
would
not
be
advisable
for
her
to
accompany
him
on
this
journey
although
she
was
the
most
cheerful
and
resolute
explorer
of
the
whole
company
a
large
tent
was
erected
for
her
in
the
corner
of
jacob
garden
and
she
was
to
take
her
meals
with
sister
louisa
whose
house
stood
close
by
with
fuzz
a
most
intelligent
dog
for
a
companion
in
her
tent
and
the
genial
sister
louisa
for
a
near
neighbour
she
was
satisfactorily
settled
fuzz
had
the
peculiarity
of
sympathising
with
the
navajos
in
their
contempt
for
the
pai
utes
the
latter
roused
his
ire
on
the
instant
but
when
a
navajo
came
up
with
his
confident
step
fuzz
would
lie
still
with
merely
a
roll
of
the
eye
to
signify
that
he
was
on
guard
saturday
may
our
caravan
of
riders
pack
animals
and
a
waggon
moved
slowly
toward
spring
the
first
stop
in
prospect
i
rode
a
brisk
little
horse
which
had
received
the
lofty
name
of
aaron
when
we
reached
spring
about
noon
there
was
barely
enough
water
for
our
animals
and
for
cooking
dinner
which
compelled
our
going
elsewhere
to
put
on
the
finishing
touches
to
our
outfit
before
cutting
loose
from
the
settlements
and
directed
the
caravan
to
continue
to
johnson
farther
east
and
up
one
of
the
canyons
of
the
vermilion
cliffs
he
returned
to
kanab
to
make
some
final
arrangements
there
while
we
kept
on
to
johnson
passing
the
little
settlement
of
two
or
three
houses
and
making
a
camp
two
miles
above
where
the
canyon
bottom
was
wide
and
level
here
we
went
over
everything
to
be
sure
that
all
was
in
good
order
and
nothing
left
behind
the
animals
were
reshod
where
necessary
which
operation
kept
andy
and
dodds
busy
all
of
sunday
the
by
thus
making
a
start
and
proceeding
a
few
miles
all
defects
and
neglects
become
apparent
before
it
is
too
late
to
remedy
them
on
monday
jack
went
back
to
kanab
with
the
waggon
returning
toward
night
with
george
adair
fennemore
had
started
with
them
but
he
had
turned
back
after
something
forgotten
and
they
did
not
know
whether
or
not
he
had
come
on
in
the
morning
george
went
off
to
look
for
him
and
met
him
down
at
the
settlement
he
had
followed
on
the
day
before
but
instead
of
turning
up
the
johnson
road
according
to
instructions
he
had
gone
ahead
on
the
road
towards
the
paria
settlement
finally
concluding
that
he
was
wrong
he
had
tried
to
correct
his
mistake
by
moonlight
but
after
a
while
gave
it
up
tied
his
mule
unsaddled
to
a
cedar
and
claimed
the
protection
of
another
for
himself
during
the
night
the
mule
chewed
the
bridle
in
two
and
departed
for
kanab
leaving
fennemore
when
daylight
came
to
walk
some
eight
miles
under
a
hot
sun
without
water
or
breakfast
to
johnson
he
was
considerably
used
up
by
this
episode
and
put
in
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
recuperating
the
evenings
were
wonderfully
beautiful
and
looking
from
a
height
the
scene
was
exceptionally
picturesque
with
the
red
rocks
the
warm
sky
the
camp
equipage
and
the
air
so
still
that
the
smoke
of
the
rose
slender
and
unbroken
till
lost
in
the
zenith
early
wednesday
morning
rode
up
on
his
powerful
horse
and
with
johnson
and
me
went
over
to
our
point
b
some
miles
away
for
some
bearings
while
fennemore
rode
in
search
of
his
abandoned
saddle
by
night
there
was
nothing
to
interfere
with
our
making
the
final
start
which
we
did
may
proceeding
up
the
canyon
without
mormon
one
of
our
strongest
horses
which
by
an
accident
had
been
injured
so
badly
that
he
had
to
be
left
behind
at
johnson
he
was
a
fractious
unruly
beast
but
with
so
great
vitality
that
we
were
sorry
not
to
have
his
services
he
died
a
week
or
two
later
towards
night
we
passed
another
very
small
settlement
called
clarkston
and
camped
near
it
the
last
houses
we
would
see
for
some
time
several
pai
utes
hung
around
and
engaged
one
called
tom
to
accompany
us
as
interpreter
and
so
far
as
he
might
know
the
country
as
guide
the
next
day
after
sixteen
miles
up
canyons
we
entered
about
three
an
exceedingly
beautiful
little
valley
with
a
fine
spring
and
a
small
lake
or
pond
at
the
lower
end
george
adair
instantly
declared
that
he
meant
to
come
back
here
to
live
and
after
dinner
when
we
reconnoitred
the
place
he
staked
out
his
claim
all
the
next
morning
june
our
way
led
over
rolling
meadows
covered
with
fine
grass
but
about
noon
this
ended
and
we
entered
the
broken
country
of
the
upper
paria
with
gullies
and
gulches
barren
and
dry
the
rest
of
the
day
except
two
in
which
we
crossed
small
branches
of
the
paria
in
one
of
the
dry
gulches
we
passed
a
grave
marked
by
a
sandstone
slab
with
cut
on
it
which
the
wolves
had
dug
out
leaving
the
human
bones
scattered
all
around
we
could
not
stop
to
reinter
them
they
were
the
remains
of
elijah
averett
a
young
mormon
who
was
killed
while
pursuing
pai
utes
in
just
before
sunset
we
arrived
at
the
banks
of
the
paria
where
we
made
camp
with
plenty
of
wood
water
and
grass
captain
dodds
during
the
afternoon
recognised
a
place
he
had
been
in
when
hunting
a
way
the
autumn
before
and
we
followed
his
old
trail
for
a
time
leaving
the
paria
the
following
day
where
it
branches
we
followed
the
east
fork
to
its
head
twelve
miles
climbing
rapidly
through
a
narrow
valley
we
could
plainly
see
on
the
left
a
high
flat
summit
which
was
called
table
mountain
and
early
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
a
series
of
and
up
one
of
which
the
old
indian
trail
we
were
now
following
took
its
precarious
way
the
were
narrow
ridges
of
with
sides
like
the
roof
of
a
house
the
trail
following
the
sharp
before
we
had
fairly
begun
this
very
steep
slippery
and
narrow
climb
the
thunder
boomed
and
the
heavens
threw
down
upon
us
fierce
torrents
of
rain
soaking
everything
and
chilling
us
through
and
through
while
making
the
trail
like
wet
soap
part
way
up
at
one
of
the
worst
places
a
pack
came
loose
and
slipping
back
hung
on
the
rump
of
the
horse
there
was
no
room
for
bucking
it
off
and
there
was
no
trouble
so
far
as
the
beast
of
burden
was
concerned
for
he
realised
fully
his
own
danger
two
of
us
managed
to
climb
along
past
the
other
animals
to
where
he
meekly
stood
waiting
on
the
narrow
ridge
with
a
descent
on
each
side
of
eight
hundred
or
nine
hundred
feet
and
set
things
in
order
once
more
when
the
cavalcade
continued
the
ascent
the
total
amount
of
which
was
some
twelve
hundred
feet
arriving
at
the
top
we
found
ourselves
almost
immediately
on
the
edge
of
a
delightful
little
valley
mossy
and
green
with
a
fresh
june
dress
down
which
we
proceeded
two
or
three
miles
to
a
spring
where
dodds
and
jacob
had
made
a
cache
of
some
flour
the
year
before
the
flour
had
disappeared
we
made
a
camp
and
dried
out
our
clothes
blankets
by
means
of
large
fires
though
it
was
summer
the
air
was
decidedly
chilly
for
we
were
at
an
altitude
of
nearly
feet
our
interpreter
that
was
to
be
did
not
enjoy
the
situation
and
i
think
he
dreaded
meeting
with
the
stranger
indians
we
might
encounter
he
declared
he
was
heap
sick
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
return
so
gave
him
several
days
rations
and
we
saw
him
no
more
there
was
a
pretty
creek
in
this
valley
flowing
eastward
which
dodds
said
was
the
head
of
the
dirty
devil
the
same
stream
he
had
followed
down
the
year
before
in
the
attempt
to
find
a
way
to
bring
us
rations
the
weather
was
very
bad
but
we
kept
on
down
potato
valley
as
it
had
been
named
crossing
three
or
four
swift
tributaries
about
four
we
stopped
beside
a
raging
torrent
and
went
into
camp
to
reconnoitre
there
were
signs
of
some
one
having
been
here
about
a
month
before
and
as
the
animals
were
shod
we
judged
it
was
some
prospector
the
next
day
was
so
wet
and
was
feeling
so
sick
that
we
kept
our
camp
having
made
tents
out
of
paulins
and
which
gave
me
a
chance
to
plot
up
the
trail
from
kanab
to
this
point
one
hundred
and
three
miles
instead
of
crossing
the
torrent
the
following
day
june
we
went
over
the
chief
stream
before
the
union
and
travelled
down
the
side
till
we
arrived
within
half
a
mile
of
the
place
where
the
river
canyoned
and
received
a
tributary
from
the
left
it
cut
into
the
rocks
very
abruptly
and
being
high
we
could
not
enter
the
canyon
as
dodds
had
done
while
the
party
camped
here
and
dodds
rode
away
to
the
south
on
a
dim
trail
to
find
out
what
move
to
make
how
far
we
might
be
able
to
go
down
the
dirty
devil
the
next
day
when
they
got
back
they
reported
finding
a
canyon
twelve
miles
farther
on
with
many
and
concluded
to
go
there
we
arrived
about
noon
thursday
june
making
camp
and
dodds
then
climbed
to
where
they
could
get
a
wide
view
and
dodds
pointed
out
the
locality
he
had
before
reached
when
he
thought
himself
so
near
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
perceived
at
once
that
we
were
not
on
the
river
we
thought
we
were
on
for
by
this
explanation
he
saw
that
the
stream
we
were
trying
to
descend
flowed
into
the
colorado
far
to
the
of
the
unknown
mountains
whereas
he
knew
positively
that
the
dirty
devil
came
in
on
the
then
the
question
was
what
river
is
this
for
we
had
not
noted
a
tributary
of
any
size
between
the
dirty
devil
and
the
san
juan
it
was
a
new
river
whose
identity
had
not
been
fathomed
this
discovery
put
a
different
complexion
on
everything
the
problem
was
more
complicated
than
dodds
had
imagined
when
he
was
trying
to
reach
the
mouth
the
year
before
declared
it
was
impossible
to
proceed
farther
in
this
direction
towards
our
goal
the
canyon
of
the
river
was
narrow
and
with
the
stream
swimming
high
it
was
out
of
the
question
as
a
path
for
us
now
and
even
had
we
been
able
to
go
down
far
enough
to
get
out
on
the
other
side
the
region
intervening
between
it
and
the
distant
mountains
was
a
heterogeneous
conglomeration
of
unknown
mesas
and
canyons
that
appeared
impassable
he
concluded
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
go
north
to
the
summit
of
the
wasatch
cliffs
and
keep
along
the
high
land
to
an
angle
where
these
slopes
vanished
to
the
north
from
that
point
we
might
be
able
to
cross
to
the
dirty
devil
or
unknown
mountains
once
at
these
mountains
we
felt
certain
of
finding
a
way
to
our
former
at
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
river
we
retraced
our
path
to
the
foot
of
potato
valley
and
there
jones
clem
and
george
adair
were
sent
out
to
kanab
for
additional
rations
it
being
plain
that
we
were
in
for
a
longer
effort
than
had
been
contemplated
they
were
to
be
here
again
in
twelve
days
to
meet
with
his
party
on
the
return
from
starting
down
the
with
a
crew
selected
from
the
seven
remaining
men
this
seven
which
included
were
now
to
strike
up
a
branch
creek
and
reach
the
upper
slopes
of
what
he
later
called
the
aquarius
plateau
and
along
its
verdant
slopes
continue
our
effort
to
reach
the
unknown
mountains
the
two
parties
separated
on
saturday
june
our
contingent
travelling
about
eighteen
miles
nearly
due
north
till
just
at
sunset
we
entered
a
high
valley
in
which
flowed
two
splendid
creeks
there
we
camped
with
an
abundance
of
everything
needed
to
make
a
comfortable
rest
for
man
and
beast
in
such
travel
as
this
the
beast
is
almost
the
first
consideration
for
without
him
movement
is
slow
and
difficult
and
distance
limited
we
had
gone
up
in
altitude
a
great
deal
or
feet
and
the
next
day
which
was
sunday
we
continued
this
upward
course
seeing
signs
of
deer
and
elk
with
an
occasional
sight
of
a
fat
pine
hen
winging
its
heavy
flight
from
tree
to
tree
the
pines
were
very
tall
and
thick
interspersed
with
fir
and
balsam
as
well
as
with
the
usual
accompaniment
of
high
altitude
in
the
west
the
aspen
our
aneroids
indicated
feet
above
and
we
could
look
down
upon
the
vast
canyoned
desert
to
the
south
as
on
a
map
descending
into
a
deep
canyon
where
a
clear
torrent
was
foaming
down
at
the
rate
of
five
hundred
feet
to
the
mile
we
went
up
a
branch
and
finally
passing
over
a
sudden
crest
discovered
before
us
a
very
beautiful
lake
of
an
extent
of
some
two
hundred
acres
it
was
now
late
and
though
we
had
come
only
ten
miles
we
went
into
camp
for
the
night
there
were
several
smaller
lagoons
nearby
and
we
named
the
group
the
aspen
lakes
around
them
in
the
dense
groves
huge
snowbanks
still
lingered
from
the
heart
of
winter
a
prettier
mountain
region
than
this
could
not
be
imagined
while
the
magnificent
outlook
to
the
south
and
east
across
the
broken
country
was
a
bewildering
sight
especially
as
the
night
enveloped
it
deepening
the
mystery
of
its
entangled
gorges
and
cliffs
from
every
point
we
could
see
the
navajo
mountain
and
at
least
we
knew
what
there
was
at
the
foot
of
its
majestic
northern
slope
i
climbed
far
above
camp
and
crossing
over
a
promontory
looked
down
upon
the
nebulous
region
to
the
eastward
that
we
were
to
fathom
and
it
seemed
to
me
one
of
the
most
interesting
sights
i
had
ever
beheld
the
night
was
so
cold
that
ice
formed
in
our
kettles
for
our
altitude
in
feet
above
sea
was
in
the
ten
thousand
still
illustration

mountain
from
near
kaiparowits
peak
photograph
by
hillers
all
the
next
morning
monday
june
we
rode
through
a
delightful
region
of
rolling
meadows
beautiful
groves
of
pines
and
aspens
and
cool
clear
creeks
near
noon
we
descended
into
a
fertile
valley
where
we
crossed
two
superb
torrential
streams
and
camped
at
the
second
under
a
giant
pine
fennemore
felt
very
sick
which
prevented
further
progress
this
day
and
we
put
in
the
afternoon
exploring
as
far
as
we
could
the
neighbourhood
more
lakes
were
found
and
as
they
were
in
a
depression
we
called
them
the
hidden
lakes
jack
made
some
fine
negatives
of
several
of
these
pretty
bodies
of
water
two
of
which
i
have
added
to
the
illustrations
of
this
volume
not
far
from
our
camp
two
more
splendid
creeks
came
together
to
form
one
which
dodds
said
he
thought
was
that
named
by
them
big
boulder
where
it
joined
the
main
stream
down
below
the
next
morning
tuesday
we
began
our
day
work
by
soon
crossing
cataract
and
cascade
creeks
before
they
united
to
form
the
big
boulder
rushing
down
with
an
impetuosity
that
was
forbidding
the
two
forming
creeks
were
much
alike
but
we
could
see
back
in
the
distance
a
beautiful
cascade
of
fully
feet
in
which
the
second
stream
originated
and
we
distinguished
it
by
that
name
all
day
we
travelled
over
a
rancher
paradise
meeting
no
indians
and
seeing
no
recent
signs
of
any
except
in
some
filmy
smoke
mounting
mysteriously
from
canyons
in
the
tangled
sandstone
labyrinth
below
who
were
they
how
many
and
what
might
be
their
temper
were
questions
that
came
to
us
as
we
reflected
on
the
presence
there
of
unknown
human
beings
and
furthermore
would
we
meet
them
and
if
so
when
as
on
the
preceding
day
we
crossed
many
fine
brooks
which
in
the
dry
season
probably
would
not
make
so
vigorous
a
showing
late
in
the
afternoon
having
travelled
fifteen
miles
we
reached
the
point
where
the
end
of
the
wasatch
or
aquarius
plateau
the
high
slope
of
which
we
were
using
as
a
bridge
from
potato
valley
to
the
unknown
mountains
broke
back
to
the
north
cutting
us
off
once
more
from
our
objective
for
a
wide
stretch
miles
in
an
airline
of
ragged
desert
apparently
impassable
still
intervened
we
camped
there
at
a
convenient
little
spring
in
the
morning
i
was
sent
with
johnson
for
my
companion
in
one
direction
down
the
mountain
to
look
for
some
old
trail
while
with
dodds
went
in
another
scarcely
had
i
gone
half
a
mile
when
i
found
tolerably
fresh
indian
sign
and
a
mile
or
two
farther
on
we
struck
a
recently
travelled
trail
the
horses
that
had
gone
over
it
were
unshod
and
there
were
moccasin
tracks
indicating
indians
without
a
doubt
but
what
kind
of
course
the
track
did
not
reveal
the
trail
led
towards
the
dirty
devil
mountains
and
we
followed
it
three
or
four
miles
to
ascertain
with
certainty
its
general
course
there
was
a
possibility
of
our
stumbling
upon
the
indians
in
camp
at
some
bend
and
as
this
was
not
desirable
for
only
two
of
us
we
turned
back
as
soon
as
we
felt
sure
of
the
direction
had
seen
no
trail
at
all
and
he
said
we
would
take
the
one
i
had
found
and
follow
it
that
night
was
disagreeable
and
rainy
with
numberless
mosquitoes
but
worst
of
all
one
of
our
new
men
always
snored
till
the
ground
shook
and
owing
to
the
rain
we
could
not
get
away
from
him
for
we
had
to
remain
in
the
improvised
tent
to
keep
dry
the
morning
light
never
was
more
welcome
and
we
were
all
up
early
the
day
was
fair
we
were
soon
off
and
made
our
way
down
from
the
grassy
heights
to
the
trail
tracing
its
wearisome
twists
and
turns
sometimes
thinking
it
was
not
going
our
way
at
all
when
the
next
turn
would
be
exactly
right
in
general
its
course
was
about
east
the
land
was
desolate
and
dry
and
exactly
as
the
region
appeared
from
above
a
complete
labyrinth
of
variously
coloured
cliffs
and
canyons
besides
being
very
crooked
on
account
of
the
nature
of
the
topography
the
trail
at
times
was
indistinct
because
of
the
barren
rocks
smooth
as
a
floor
with
nothing
to
take
an
imprint
in
these
places
we
were
obliged
to
make
the
best
guess
we
could
we
came
to
a
place
where
a
valley
lay
about
feet
below
us
with
the
descent
to
it
over
bare
smooth
white
sandstone
almost
as
steep
as
a
horse
could
stand
on
we
travelled
a
mile
and
a
half
over
this
and
then
found
ourselves
in
a
better
looking
region
where
after
a
few
miles
we
discovered
a
beautiful
creek
flowing
rapidly
there
was
plenty
of
good
grass
and
we
made
our
camp
beneath
some
cottonwood
trees
having
accomplished
twenty
miles
the
way
we
came
smoke
of
an
indian
fire
was
rolling
up
about
three
miles
below
us
but
we
paid
little
attention
to
it
every
man
delayed
putting
down
his
blankets
till
the
champion
snorer
had
selected
the
site
of
his
bed
and
then
we
all
got
as
far
away
as
the
locality
would
permit
having
slept
little
the
night
before
we
hardly
stirred
till
morning
and
in
gratitude
we
called
the
stream
pleasant
creek
without
an
attempt
at
originality
it
was
friday
may
and
our
long
cavalcade
proceeded
in
the
usual
single
file
down
along
the
creek
in
the
direction
of
the
indian
smoke
scarcely
had
we
gone
three
miles
when
suddenly
we
heard
a
yell
and
the
bark
of
a
dog
then
we
discovered
two
squaws
on
the
other
side
who
had
been
gathering
seeds
and
who
were
now
giving
the
alarm
for
we
were
close
upon
an
indian
camp
set
on
the
edge
of
a
low
hill
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
our
outfit
presented
rather
a
formidable
appearance
especially
as
we
were
an
unexpected
apparition
and
we
could
see
them
all
running
to
hide
though
i
thought
for
a
moment
we
might
have
a
battle
without
a
halt
led
the
way
across
the
creek
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
as
we
reached
the
place
one
poor
old
man
left
as
a
sacrifice
came
tottering
down
so
overcome
by
fear
that
he
could
barely
articulate
meaning
very
friendly
he
was
and
extending
his
trembling
hand
doubtless
he
expected
to
be
shot
on
the
instant
with
a
laugh
we
each
shook
his
hand
in
turn
saying
old
man
and
rode
up
the
hill
into
the
camp
where
we
found
all
the
wickiups
with
everything
lying
about
just
as
they
had
been
using
it
at
the
moment
of
receiving
the
alarm
we
dismounted
and
inducing
the
terrified
old
man
to
sit
down
in
one
of
the
wickiups
sat
with
him
and
we
rolled
cigarettes
giving
him
one
and
when
all
were
smoking
except
who
never
used
tobacco
we
urged
him
in
english
and
pai
ute
and
by
signs
to
call
the
others
back
i
walked
a
few
yards
out
on
the
hill
and
just
then
with
a
rush
and
a
clatter
of
language
i
could
not
understand
except
impoo
immy
pshakai
what
do
you
want
the
two
squaws
who
had
been
up
the
creek
arrived
the
foremost
one
frothing
at
the
mouth
with
excitement
and
effort
dashed
at
me
with
an
uplifted
butcher
knife
as
if
she
would
enjoy
sending
it
into
me
but
i
laughed
at
her
and
she
halted
immediately
in
front
of
me
she
broke
into
a
maniacal
laugh
then
and
shouted
something
to
the
hidden
refugees
we
persuaded
the
old
man
also
to
call
them
and
he
stepped
out
from
the
cedars
which
grew
on
the
point
and
spoke
a
loud
sentence
at
last
they
began
to
appear
silently
and
one
by
one
there
were
eight
of
the
men
all
well
dressed
in
buckskin
and
a
number
of
women
and
children
when
they
became
confident
that
we
really
meant
to
be
friendly
they
relaxed
their
vigilance
with
the
hope
of
securing
a
guide
and
also
to
study
them
a
little
we
went
into
camp
in
the
creek
bottom
under
the
hill
where
they
came
to
visit
us
their
language
and
appearance
showed
them
to
be
utes
when
got
back
to
kanab
he
heard
that
a
party
of
red
lake
utes
had
killed
a
white
boy
near
the
sevier
settlements
and
he
concluded
this
band
must
have
been
the
one
they
probably
thought
we
were
pursuing
them
into
their
secret
lair
to
punish
them
their
great
anxiety
to
trade
for
powder
indicated
their
lack
of
that
article
and
partly
explained
the
precipitousness
of
their
retreat
they
had
numbers
of
well
dressed
buckskins
and
a
very
small
amount
of
powder
would
buy
one
but
as
we
had
only
metallic
cartridges
we
could
do
little
in
the
line
of
exchange
to
satisfy
one
of
them
that
we
had
no
loose
powder
i
removed
the
spring
from
the
magazine
of
my
winchester
and
poured
the
sixteen
cartridges
out
he
had
never
seen
such
a
gun
before
and
was
greatly
astonished
though
he
hardly
understood
how
it
worked
tried
his
best
to
persuade
one
to
go
with
us
as
a
guide
for
the
labyrinth
ahead
was
a
puzzle
but
whether
through
fear
or
disinclination
to
leave
friends
not
one
would
go
the
chief
gave
us
a
minute
description
of
the
trail
to
the
unknown
or
dirty
devil
mountains
as
well
as
he
could
by
signs
and
words
some
of
which
we
could
not
understand
and
long
afterwards
we
learned
that
his
information
was
exactly
correct
though
at
the
time
through
misunderstanding
we
were
not
able
to
follow
it
they
also
told
us
there
was
a
trail
to
the
big
river
beyond
the
mountains
there
was
a
little
canyon
in
the
creek
nearby
and
the
water
rushed
down
over
a
bed
of
bare
rock
at
an
angle
of
about
twenty
degrees
we
were
surprised
to
discover
hundreds
of
fish
six
to
nine
inches
long
wriggling
up
the
stream
along
one
edge
where
the
water
was
very
shallow
they
formed
a
line
from
top
to
bottom
unable
to
secure
the
guide
we
left
at
six
in
the
morning
saturday
june
with
all
our
relations
cordial
the
utes
going
away
before
we
did
and
struck
out
on
the
trail
which
led
from
this
camp
travelling
twelve
miles
we
passed
through
a
narrow
canyon
into
a
larger
one
believing
that
we
were
following
the
direction
recent
heavy
rains
had
washed
out
the
trail
and
not
knowing
its
course
it
was
impossible
to
keep
even
its
general
direction
going
up
a
branch
of
the
canyon
that
is
to
the
north
we
found
no
exit
so
we
came
down
and
followed
a
trail
up
the
branch
till
it
disappeared
then
going
back
once
more
to
the
entrance
we
again
went
up
the
branch
till
we
came
to
a
vertical
wall
one
thousand
feet
high
which
turned
us
around
the
one
was
entered
another
time
and
towards
its
head
where
the
cliffs
could
not
be
climbed
we
made
camp
with
an
abundance
of
water
which
was
so
strongly
alkaline
we
could
not
use
it
and
had
to
keep
the
stock
from
it
also
our
kegs
were
full
and
we
did
not
suffer
except
by
limitation
in
the
morning
we
continued
up
the
same
canyon
till
it
ended
in
vertical
cliffs
beneath
which
there
was
a
large
pool
of
pure
cool
water
with
ferns
clinging
above
it
to
the
rocks
and
rank
vegetation
all
around
this
was
an
immense
relief
and
we
found
it
hard
to
turn
our
backs
on
so
attractive
a
spot
and
go
down
the
gorge
once
more
to
a
point
not
far
below
our
last
camp
here
the
walls
were
about
a
thousand
feet
and
very
precipitous
though
somewhat
broken
jack
dodds
and
i
climbed
out
on
the
north
and
hunted
for
water
in
different
directions
on
the
top
i
kept
on
and
on
down
a
dry
wash
persisting
against
the
objection
of
dodds
who
thought
it
useless
and
was
at
last
rewarded
by
discovering
a
pocket
among
the
rocks
containing
several
barrels
of
water
with
another
that
was
larger
a
short
distance
below
in
a
crevice
on
a
at
the
brink
of
a
canyon
we
returned
to
camp
with
this
news
where
and
jack
soon
joined
us
they
had
found
no
pockets
but
had
seen
the
divide
between
the
waters
of
the
colorado
and
the
dirty
devil
which
we
could
follow
to
the
mountains
if
we
could
scale
the
cliffs
had
selected
a
point
where
he
thought
we
could
mount
with
a
liberal
use
of
axe
shovel
and
pick
we
succeeded
in
gaining
the
summit
in
an
hour
and
a
half
with
all
the
we
had
done
with
horses
this
seemed
to
me
our
paramount
achievement
the
day
was
ending
by
this
time
and
i
led
the
way
with
some
trepidation
towards
the
pocket
i
had
found
for
in
my
haste
to
get
back
i
had
not
carefully
noted
the
topography
the
cedars
and
piñons
all
looked
alike
in
the
twilight
shades
and
as
i
went
on
and
on
the
men
behind
began
to
lose
faith
and
made
joking
remarks
about
my
mental
status
i
felt
certain
i
was
right
yet
the
distance
seemed
so
much
greater
in
the
dusk
than
when
i
had
traversed
it
on
foot
that
i
was
a
little
disturbed
by
the
time
we
at
last
got
to
the
pocket
darkness
was
upon
us
though
nobody
cared
for
anything
but
water
and
there
it
was
fresh
and
pure
the
animals
and
ourselves
andy
filling
the
kettles
first
consumed
the
entire
amount
but
it
gave
each
a
full
drink
and
we
held
the
second
pool
in
reserve

for

just
above

at
the
bottom
of
the
map
the
dirty
devil
enters
from
the
north
at
the
upper
side
when
morning
came
we
engineered
a
way
for
the
animals
down
to
the
shelf
where
the
other
pocket
was
twenty
or
thirty
feet
below
by
pulling
rocks
away
in
places
and
piling
them
up
in
others
the
shelf
was
perhaps
fifty
or
sixty
feet
wide
with
a
sheer
plunge
of
one
thousand
feet
at
the
outer
end
into
the
first
canyon
we
had
followed
the
animals
could
not
get
to
the
water
but
we
dipped
it
out
for
them
in
the
camp
kettles
the
way
up
from
the
shelf
was
so
very
steep
that
at
one
point
two
of
us
had
to
put
our
shoulders
to
the
haunches
of
some
of
the
horses
to
boost
them
while
other
men
pulled
on
a
strong
halter
from
above
and
in
this
way
we
soon
had
them
all
watered
and
ready
for
pack
and
saddle
keeping
along
the
divide
we
had
comparatively
easy
going
with
the
unknown
mountains
ever
looming
nearer
till
their
blue
mystery
vanished
and
we
could
discern
ordinary
rocks
and
trees
composing
their
slopes
about
noon
we
arrived
at
the
edge
of
an
intervening
valley
with
the
wind
blowing
so
fierce
a
gale
that
we
could
barely
see
crossing
this
depression
we
reached
a
small
creek
at
the
foot
of
the
second
mountain
from
the
north
now
mt
pennell
and
climbed
its
slope
seventeen
hundred
feet
to
a
beautiful
spring
where
we
camped
with
plenty
of
fine
grass
for
the
famished
horses
we
had
at
last
traversed
the
unknown
to
the
unknown
and
felt
well
satisfied
with
our
success
if
it
had
ever
been
done
before
by
white
men
there
was
no
knowledge
of
it
the
temperature
was
so
low
that
water
froze
in
the
camp
kettles
and
next
morning
june
the
thermometer
stood
at
with
the
water
of
the
little
brook
running
from
the
spring
at
after
breakfast
jack
and
dodds
climbed
the
mountain
on
which
we
were
camped
running
their
aneroid
out
while
with
johnson
i
went
down
the
slope
north
crossed
the
pass
and
climbed
the
first
mountain
now
mt
ellen
after
thompson
a
severe
set
in
and
when
we
had
finally
attained
a
point
where
our
aneroid
indicated
feet
above
we
were
obliged
to
turn
back
because
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
having
no
coats
no
food
or
water
when
we
reached
camp
on
the
other
mountain
night
had
come
andy
had
been
trying
to
cook
some
beans
but
the
high
altitude
prevented
the
water
from
getting
hot
enough
and
the
operation
was
incomplete
i
foolishly
ate
some
of
the
beans
being
very
hungry
with
the
result
that
i
was
sick
for
the
first
time
on
the
expedition
suffering
a
horrible
though
not
disabled
i
was
extremely
uncomfortable
in
the
morning
we
started
to
go
around
north
through
the
pass
to
the
east
side
of
the
mountain
and
i
ran
in
the
trail
as
usual
mounting
and
dismounting
many
times
till
i
was
extremely
glad
after
eight
miles
when
we
came
to
the
head
of
a
little
creek
and
stopped
to
enable
to
climb
the
third
peak
mt
hillers
for
observations
while
he
was
gone
i
was
content
to
lie
still
in
the
shade
of
a
bush
and
finally
lost
my
pain
in
sleep
got
back
so
late
that
we
camped
where
we
were
much
to
my
satisfaction
the
view
from
our
camp
was
extensive
and
magnificent
the
whole
dirty
devil
region
lying
open
like
a
book
below
us
we
were
striking
for
the
creek
up
which
and
cap
had
come
the
year
before
from
the
river
for
we
knew
that
from
its
mouth
we
could
easily
get
to
where
our
was
cached
the
next
day
june
we
continued
down
trachyte
creek
as
called
it
till
four
passing
many
old
camps
and
grazing
grounds
when
we
halted
for
to
climb
to
a
height
the
outlook
there
showed
him
that
this
was
not
the
stream
whose
canyon
below
we
wanted
to
descend
to
the
river
so
the
following
morning
he
took
dodds
and
reconnoitred
the
latter
after
a
while
returning
with
orders
for
us
to
come
on
eastward
to
another
canyon
we
left
trachyte
creek
and
reached
at
two
he
had
prospected
a
trail
or
rather
a
way
to
descend
into
the
canyon
over
the
smooth
bare
sandstone
across
which
we
wound
back
and
forth
for
a
mile
constantly
going
down
into
the
strange
weird
depths
till
at
last
we
reached
the
creek
bed
where
a
short
distance
below
we
went
into
camp
in
a
beautiful
green
cottonwood
grove
with
enormous
pockets
of
good
water
close
by
by
seven
in
the
morning
of
the
we
were
going
on
down
the
deep
narrow
canyon
and
arrived
at
the
colorado
at
ten
the
river
was
at
least
fifteen
feet
higher
than
last
year
and
rushed
by
with
a
majestic
power
that
was
impressive
our
first
unusual
incident
was
when
horse
in
trying
to
drink
from
a
soft
bank
dropped
down
into
the
swift
current
and
gave
us
half
an
hour
difficult
work
to
get
him
out
when
we
had
eaten
dinner
we
all
went
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
dirty
devil
where
we
had
stored
the
and
rejoiced
to
find
her
lying
just
as
we
left
her
except
that
the
water
had
risen
to
that
level
and
washed
away
one
of
the
oars
we
caulked
the
boat
temporarily
launched
her
once
more
on
the
sweeping
tide
and
in
two
minutes
were
at
our
camp
where
we
hauled
her
out
for
the
repairs
necessary
to
make
her
sound
for
the
run
to
the
paria
sunday
was
the
next
day
june
and
while
the
others
rested
i
plotted
in
the
trail
by
which
we
had
crossed
to
this
place
so
that
could
take
it
out
with
him
as
he
decided
that
jack
johnson
fennemore
and
i
were
to
take
the
boat
down
while
he
andy
and
dodds
would
go
back
overland
to
meet
jones
and
george
adair
at
the
foot
of
potato
valley
at
five
they
left
us
going
up
the
same
canyon
we
had
come
down
and
which
we
called
lost
creek
canyon
now
crescent
creek
the
next
day
we
recaulked
and
painted
the
boat
and
i
put
the
name
in
red
letters
on
the
stern
and
a
red
star
on
each
side
of
the
bow
by
wednesday
the
she
was
all
ready
and
we
put
her
in
the
water
and
ran
down
four
miles
to
the
large
shinumo
house
jack
rowed
the
stern
oars
johnson
the
bow
i
steered
while
fennemore
sat
on
the
middle
deck
the
high
water
completely
obliterated
the
aggravating
shoals
which
had
bothered
us
the
year
before
and
we
had
no
work
at
all
except
to
steer
or
to
land
the
current
carrying
us
along
at
a
good
pace
we
stopped
occasionally
for
pictures
and
notes
and
got
about
everything
that
jack
and
fennemore
wanted
in
the
line
of
photographs
the
fourth
of
july
we
celebrated
by
firing
fourteen
rounds
and
i
made
a
lemon
cake
and
a
for
dinner
on
sunday
the
we
passed
the
mouth
of
the
stream
that
had
been
mistaken
for
the
dirty
devil
and
which
had
named
escalante
river
it
was
narrow
and
shallow
and
would
not
be
taken
at
its
mouth
for
so
important
a
tributary
the
next
day
we
passed
the
san
juan
which
was
running
a
very
large
stream
and
camped
at
the
music
temple
where
i
cut
jack
name
and
mine
under
those
of
the
howlands
and
dunn
the
rapid
below
was
dashing
but
easy
and
we
ran
it
without
stopping
to
examine
on
friday
the
we
came
to
el
vado
and
dug
up
a
cache
we
had
made
there
the
year
before
our
rations
for
some
time
were
nothing
but
bread
and
coffee
and
we
were
glad
to
see
the
echo
peaks
and
then
run
in
at
the
mouth
of
the
paria
on
saturday
july
with
the
expectation
of
finding
men
and
supplies
the
was
lying
high
and
dry
on
the
bank
and
we
wondered
who
had
taken
her
from
her
firing
our
signal
shots
and
receiving
no
answer
jack
and
i
went
up
the
paria
crossing
it
on
a
log
and
saw
a
cabin
and
a
farm
on
the
west
side
this
we
knew
must
be
lee
he
was
ploughing
in
a
field
and
when
he
first
sighted
us
he
seemed
a
little
startled
doubtless
thinking
we
might
be
officers
to
arrest
him
one
of
his
wives
rachel
went
into
the
cabin
not
far
off
and
peered
out
at
us
she
was
a
fine
shot
as
i
afterwards
learned
lee
received
us
pleasantly
and
invited
us
to
take
our
meals
at
his
house
till
our
party
came
as
we
had
nothing
but
bread
and
coffee
and
not
much
of
these
we
accepted
the
fresh
vegetables
out
of
the
garden
which
his
other
wife
lee
served
nicely
cooked
seemed
the
most
delicious
food
that
could
be
prepared
lee
xviii
was
a
stout
comely
young
woman
of
about
with
two
small
children
and
seemed
to
be
entirely
happy
in
the
situation
the
other
wife
whose
number
i
did
not
learn
left
before
dark
for
a
house
they
had
at
jacob
pool
and
i
never
saw
her
again

lee
had
worked
hard
since
his
arrival
early
in
the
year
and
now
had
his
farm
in
fairly
good
order
with
crops
growing
well
irrigated
by
the
water
he
took
out
of
the
paria
he
called
the
place
lonely
dell
and
it
was
not
a
misnomer
johnson
made
arrangements
to
go
to
kanab
the
next
day
as
he
concluded
that
his
health
would
not
permit
him
to
go
through
the
grand
canyon
with
us
so
this
was
our
last
night
with
him
lee
gave
me
his
own
version
of
the
mountain
meadows
massacre
claiming
that
he
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
had
tried
to
stop
it
and
when
he
could
not
do
so
he
went
to
his
house
and
cried
the
pai
utes
ever
after
called
him
naguts
or
crybaby
in
the
morning
sunday
july
johnson
departed
with
lee
and
we
expected
someone
to
arrive
to
bring
us
news
of
the
major
and
but
the
sun
went
down
once
more
without
any
message
we
felt
sure
that
got
out
of
the
dirty
devil
country
without
accident
but
we
wanted
some
definite
information
of
it
and
we
also
desired
to
know
when
we
would
resume
the
canyon
voyage
on
monday
having
nothing
else
to
do
we
took
some
hoes
and
worked
in
lee
garden
till
near
noon
when
we
heard
yells
which
proved
to
come
from
andy
and
clem
with
a
waggon
needing
some
help
over
bad
places
we
soon
had
the
waggon
in
a
good
spot
under
some
willows
and
there
speedily
ransacked
it
for
mail
spending
the
rest
of
the
day
reading
letters
and
newspapers
andy
told
us
that
had
reached
kanab
with
no
trouble
of
any
kind
lee
or
sister
emma
as
she
would
in
utah
properly
be
called
invited
us
to
dinner
and
supper
and
the
next
day
we
worked
in
the
garden
again
repaired
the
irrigating
ditch
and
helped
about
the
place
in
a
general
way
glad
enough
to
have
some
occupation
even
though
the
sun
was
burning
hot
and
the
thermometer
stood
at
in
the
shade
almost
every
day
we
did
some
work
in
the
garden
and
we
also
repaired
the
irrigating
dam
our
camp
was
across
the
paria
down
by
the
colorado
and
when
brother
lee
came
back
the
following
sunday
he
called
to
give
us
a
lengthy
dissertation
on
the
faith
of
the
saints
mormons
while
andy
always
up
to
mischief
in
his
quiet
way
delighted
to
get
behind
him
and
cock
a
rifle
at
the
sound
of
the
ominous
click
lee
would
wheel
like
a
flash
to
see
what
was
up
we
had
no
intention
of
capturing
him
of
course
but
it
amused
andy
to
act
in
a
way
that
kept
lee
on
the
we
got
the
out
of
her
shed
and
found
her
in
very
bad
condition
while
the
was
about
as
we
had
left
her
andy
and
jack
went
to
work
on
the
and
in
a
few
days
had
her
in
excellent
trim
on
july
which
is
the
day
the
mormons
celebrate
for
the
settlement
of
salt
lake
valley
lee
invited
us
to
dinner
and
supper
which
gave
us
a
very
pleasant
time
so
far
as
our
intercourse
with
lee
was
concerned
we
had
no
cause
for
complaint
he
was
genial
courteous
and
generous
a
copy
of
deforrest
was
in
camp
and
i
whiled
away
some
hours
reading
it
but
time
began
to
hang
heavily
upon
us
and
we
daily
longed
for
the
appearance
of
the
rest
of
the
party
so
that
we
might
push
out
on
the
great
red
flood
that
moved
irresistibly
down
into
the
maw
of
marble
canyon
and
end
the
uncertainty
that
lay
before
us
august
the
first
came
and
still
no
message
fennemore
now
felt
so
sick
that
jack
took
him
to
lee
with
rations
in
order
that
he
might
have
vegetables
with
his
meals
with
the
hope
that
he
would
recover
but
he
grew
worse
and
on
august
he
decided
that
he
would
return
to
his
home
in
salt
lake
we
concluded
that
one
of
us
must
go
to
kanab
to
inform
of
the
state
of
affairs
and
clem
in
his
way
offered
to
do
this
but
we
knew
that
his
sense
of
locality
was
defective
and
that
he
might
get
lost
consequently
we
played
on
him
an
innocent
trick
which
i
may
now
tell
as
he
long
ago
went
across
the
range
i
planned
with
andy
that
we
three
were
to
draw
cuts
for
the
honour
of
the
ride
and
that
andy
was
to
let
me
draw
the
fatal
one
clem
was
greatly
disappointed
jack
went
on
a
chase
after
nig
and
ran
him
down
about
sunset
for
nig
was
the
most
diplomatic
mule
that
ever
lived
having
no
saddle
i
borrowed
one
from
lee
who
let
me
have
it
dubiously
as
he
feared
we
might
be
laying
some
trap
i
gave
him
my
word
that
while
i
had
his
saddle
no
man
of
ours
would
molest
him
and
furthermore
that
they
would
befriend
him
i
rode
away
while
he
remarked
that
in
the
rocks
he
could
defy
an
army
with
regret
still
in
his
eyes
though
he
accepted
my
pledge
i
got
out
a
few
miles
before
dark
and
slept
by
the
roadside
with
the
distant
murmur
of
rapids
speaking
to
me
of
the
turmoil
we
were
soon
to
pass
through
by
noon
of
the
next
day
i
was
at
jacob
pool
by
three
at
house
rock
spring
and
at
night
in
summit
valley
where
i
camped
the
day
was
so
hot
that
i
could
hardly
bear
my
hand
on
my
rifle
barrel
as
it
lay
across
my
saddle
my
lunch
of
jerked
beef
and
bread
i
ate
as
i
rode
along
thus
losing
no
time
the
trail
across
the
kaibab
was
not
often
travelled
and
it
was
dim
and
hard
to
follow
a
faint
horse
track
showing
here
and
there
so
i
lost
it
several
times
but
quickly
picked
it
up
again
and
finally
came
out
of
the
forest
where
i
could
see
all
the
now
familiar
country
to
the
west
and
north
about
two
i
arrived
at
kanab
and
rode
to
house
where
sister
louisa
told
me
that
the
major
thompson
professor
de
motte
and
george
adair
had
left
that
very
morning
for
the
south
end
of
the
kaibab
on
the
way
to
the
paria
and
that
jones
and
lyman
hamblin
the
day
before
had
started
for
the
paria
with
a
waggon
load
of
supplies
drawn
by
a
team
of
four
broncho
mules
nig
being
very
tired
i
thought
i
would
rest
till
morning
when
he
rewarded
my
consideration
by
eluding
me
till
ten
this
gave
me
so
late
a
start
that
it
was
dark
and
rainy
when
i
descended
the
east
side
of
the
kaibab
and
i
had
to
drag
nig
down
the
feet
in
the
gloom
over
boulders
bushes
ledges
or
anything
else
that
came
for
i
could
see
only
a
few
feet
and
could
not
keep
the
trail
i
reached
house
rock
spring
at
last
and
camped
there
in
the
morning
i
discovered
jones
and
lyman
down
in
the
valley
and
joined
them
for
breakfast
after
which
i
helped
them
start
this
was
no
easy
matter
for
the
four
mules
they
had
in
harness
with
one
exception
were
as
wild
as
mountain
sheep
having
only
recently
been
broken
jones
had
been
badly
kicked
three
times
his
hands
were
burned
by
the
ropes
and
there
was
a
lively
time
whenever
the
excited
animals
were
put
to
the
waggon
the
road
was
new
only
a
waggon
track
in
reality
and
the
mules
became
more
and
more
docile
through
exhaustion
as
the
day
went
on
at
night
they
were
far
safer
to
handle
than
in
the
morning
july
about
dark
we
arrived
at
lonely
dell
lee
stealing
suspiciously
in
behind
where
i
was
walking
to
ask
me
who
the
men
were
and
what
they
wanted
we
had
a
joyful
time
especially
as
steward
had
sent
out
a
large
box
of
fine
candy
which
we
found
in
the
mail
and
opened
at
once
four
days
later
the
major
and
his
party
came
from
the
kaibab
and
we
had
venison
for
supper
the
major
said
we
would
go
on
down
the
colorado
as
soon
as
possible
though
the
water
was
still
very
high

fall
in
the

caught
in

deep

and
a
at
the
mouth
of
the
kanab
we
now
missed
steward
cap
and
beaman
more
than
ever
for
we
had
been
unable
to
get
anyone
to
take
their
places
the
fact
was
our
prospective
voyage
through
marble
and
grand
canyons
was
considered
almost
a
forlorn
hope
and
nobody
cared
to
take
the
risk
the
plan
had
been
to
give
me
the
steering
of
the
but
now
with
three
boats
and
only
seven
to
man
them
it
was
plain
that
one
must
be
abandoned
an
examination
of
them
all
showed
that
the
was
in
the
poorest
condition
and
she
was
chosen
for
the
sacrifice
she
was
put
back
in
her
shelter
being
afterwards
used
by
lee
for
a
desultory
ferry
business
that
developed
about
ten
days
before
our
arrival
the
had
been
discovered
by
a
newspaper
man
named
beadle
and
used
to
cross
to
the
north
side
where
he
left
her
this
was
how
she
happened
to
be
there
when
we
came
beadle
had
denounced
lee
and
the
mormons
in
print
and
tried
to
conceal
his
identity
by
assuming
the
name
of
hanson
a
plan
frustrated
by
his
having
some
clothes
marked
with
his
own
name
laundered
by
sister
emma
lee
was
only
amused
by
the
incident
the
was
to
be
manned
by
the
same
crew
as
before
jones
to
steer
jack
at
the
after
oars
i
at
the
forward
pair
and
the

in
his
usual
place
on
the
middle
deck
the
was
to
have
as
steersman
andy
at
the
stroke
oars
and
clem
in
the
bow
clem
having
gotten
all
over
his
inclination
to
leave
and
being
determined
now
to
see
the
end
of
the
voyage
before
he
departed
the
same
day
that
the
major
and
his
party
arrived
jack
and
i
with
jones
steering
tried
the
by
taking
thompson
professor
demotte
and
lyman
hamblin
up
the
river
so
that
they
might
see
what
a
canyon
was
like
from
a
boat
thompson
was
so
enthusiastic
that
she
declared
she
wanted
to
accompany
us
took
her
as
passenger
on
the
about
four
on
wednesday
august
when
we
had
completed
the
sacking
and
packing
of
provisions
and
with
both
boats
ran
down
through
a
small
rapid
or
two
about
a
mile
and
a
half
where
we
camped
at
the
mouth
of
a
little
canyon
down
which
the
came
thompson
enjoyed
the
exhilaration
of
descending
the
swift
rushing
water
and
still
thought
it
attractive
i
went
to
lee
and
brought
down
the
major
for
our
boat
and
saw
fennemore
who
was
very
sick
we
made
our
final
preparations
at
this
point
and
i
spent
most
of
thursday
morning
helping
the
major
get
his
papers
in
order
so
that
if
we
did
not
appear
again
his
affairs
could
be
readily
settled
this
required
considerable
writing
which
i
did
for
the
major
wrote
slowly
with
his
left
hand
the
only
one
he
had
we
dined
with
lee
having
the
first
watermelon
of
the
season
for
dessert
lee
was
most
cordial
and
we
could
not
have
asked
better
treatment
than
he
gave
us
the
whole
time
we
were
at
lonely
dell
in
the
afternoon
our
land
outfit
left
for
kanab
and
we
said
a
last
to
the
men
who
looked
as
if
they
never
expected
to
see
us
again
only
the
tirtaan
aigles
remained
and
there
were
but
seven
of
these
now
the
next
day
we
put
the
finishing
touches
on
the
boats
and
while
we
were
doing
this
our
late
fellow
voyageur
beaman
and
a
companion
named
carleton
passed
on
their
way
to
the
moki
towns
where
beaman
wanted
to
make
photographs
all
being
ready
the
next
day
saturday
august
we
pushed
out
on
the
mighty
colorado
about
nine
and
by
noon
ran
into
marble
canyon
nearly
five
miles
passing
one
small
rapid
and
another
of
considerable
size
on
a
river
about
one
hundred
feet
wide
and
extremely
swift
with
straight
walls
rapidly
increasing
from
the
fifty
feet
or
so
at
the
paria
marble
canyon
while
differing
in
name
is
but
the
upper
continuation
of
the
grand
canyon
there
being
no
line
of
demarkation
other
than
a
change
in
geological
structure
and
the
entrance
of
the
canyon
of
the
little
colorado
the
combined
length
of
the
two
divisions
is
miles
and
the
declivity
is
very
great
the
altitude
of
the
mouth
of
the
paria
is
feet
while
the
grand
wash
at
the
end
of
the
grand
canyon
is
feet
leaving
a
descent
of
feet
still
before
us
at
our
dinner
camp
which
was
on
a
talus
on
the
left
the
walls
were
about
feet
and
quite
precipitous
but
i
was
able
to
climb
out
on
the
right
to
get
a
view
of
the
surroundings
after
dinner
we
went
on
in
our
usual
order
our
boat
the
in
advance
and
the
following
the
photographing
now
devolved
entirely
on
jack
and
clem
andy
as
usual
ran
the
culinary
branch
of
the
expedition
jones
and
meandered
the
river
we
had
not
gone
far
after
dinner
before
we
were
close
upon
a
rapid
a
drop
of
about
eighteen
feet
in
a
distance
of
which
we
concluded
to
defeat
by
means
of
a
portage
on
the
bank
as
we
knew
exactly
what
to
do
no
time
was
wasted
and
we
were
soon
below
sweeping
on
with
a
stiff
current
which
brought
us
in
about
ten
miles
from
our
morning
start
and
five
from
the
noon
halt
to
a
far
worse
rapid
than
the
last
a
fall
of
feet
in
four
or
five
hundred
with
very
straight
walls
six
hundred
feet
high
on
both
sides
the
major
concluded
to
leave
the
passage
of
it
till
the
next
day
and
we
went
into
camp
at
the
head
this
was
the
rapid
where
disaster
fell
on
the
miners
ten
in
number
who
in
the
spring
had
stolen
a
lot
of
our
things
at
the
paria
and
started
down
prospecting
on
a
raft
they
saved
their
lives
but
not
another
thing
and
after
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
they
succeeded
by
means
of
driftwood
ladders
in
climbing
to
the
top
of
the
walls
and
made
their
way
to
the
settlement
this
is
now
called
soap
creek
rapid
being
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
by
which
the
little
stream
of
that
name
reaches
the
river
a
little
stream
which
at
times
is
a
mighty
torrent
in
a
small
rapid
following
or
in
the
final
portion
of
this
i
believe
is
the
place
where
frank
brown
leader
of
the
denver
colorado
canyon
and
pacific
railway
survey
was
drowned
in
we
began
work
on
sunday
august
by
making
the
portage
and
had
no
trouble
of
any
kind
jack
and
clem
making
some
photographs
before
we
finally
said
to
the
place
continuing
on
our
way
we
found
the
river
very
narrow
not
over
feet
in
many
places
and
ranging
from
that
to
two
hundred
with
frequent
whirlpools
strong
enough
to
swing
our
boats
entirely
around
before
we
had
put
five
large
rapids
behind
and
then
we
halted
under
a
ledge
on
the
left
a
short
distance
above
a
very
ugly
and
difficult
prospect
there
was
an
exceedingly
heavy
descent
and
a
soft
sandstone
being
at
the
river
margin
it
was
worn
away
giving
little
chance
for
a
footing
by
which
to
make
a
portage
the
major
and
decided
that
we
could
run
it
safely
and
after
dinner
we
shot
into
it
both
boats
going
through
in
fine
style
just
below
was
another
smaller
one
that
was
vanquished
easily
and
we
went
swiftly
on
down
the
swirling
booming
current
rain
fell
at
intervals
to
continue
our
saturation
and
with
four
more
rapids
all
of
which
we
ran
one
having
quite
a
heavy
fall
there
was
little
chance
for
us
to
dry
out
at
one
point
we
passed
an
enormous
rock
which
had
dropped
from
the
cliffs
overhead
and
almost
blocked
the
whole
river
then
we
arrived
at
a
huge
rapid
whose
angry
tones
cried
so
distinctly
no
running
through
here
that
we
did
not
hesitate
but
began
a
let
down
forthwith
and
when
that
was
accomplished
we
camped
at
the
foot
of
it
for
the
night
having
come
eleven
and
miles
during
the
day
the
rapid
was
extremely
noisy
and
the
roaring
reverberated
back
and
forth
from
cliff
to
cliff
as
it
ascended
to
the
top
feet
to
escape
into
the
larger
air
the
walls
had
two
or
three
terraces
and
were
not
over
three
quarters
of
a
mile
apart
at
the
summit
the
cliff
portions
being
nearly
or
quite
perpendicular
the
rocks
of
all
sizes
which
were
legion
at
each
rapid
were
frequently
dovetailed
into
each
other
by
the
action
of
the
current
and
so
neatly
joined
in
a
serrated
line
that
they
were
practically
one
illustration

photograph
by
hillers
the
rapidity
with
which
the
water
went
down
and
the
walls
went
up
as
we
cut
into
the
plateau
gave
a
vivid
impression
of
descending
into
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
and
this
impression
seemed
daily
to
intensify
on
monday
august
the
same
conditions
prevailed
the
walls
being
of
marble
mostly
vertical
from
the
water
edge
for
about
seven
hundred
feet
and
then
rising
by
four
terraces
to
two
thousand
feet
all
stained
red
by
the
disintegration
of
rocks
overhead
though
the
marble
is
a
grey
colour
we
only
made
four
and
miles
and
established
camp
on
the
left
just
below
a
big
rapid
and
in
sight
of
another
with
a
record
for
the
whole
day
of
four
rapids
run
three
passed
by
and
one
overcome
by
a
portage
the
next
day
we
did
not
accomplish
a
much
greater
distance
only
about
nine
miles
but
we
were
highly
successful
in
our
encounters
with
the
enemy
running
no
less
than
twelve
big
rapids
and
making
a
portage
at
another
to
round
out
the
dozen
on
the
baker
proverbial
basis
the
average
width
of
the
canyon
at
the
top
was
about
one
and
a
quarter
miles
while
the
breadth
of
the
water
itself
plunging
along
the
bottom
was
not
more
than
feet
and
the
total
height
of
wall
was
feet
we
had
marble
at
the
river
margin
most
of
the
day
a
greyish
crystalline
rock
fluted
multitudinously
in
places
by
the
action
of
high
water
and
sometimes
polished
like
glass
while
this
was
a
grey
rock
the
entire
effect
of
the
canyon
for
the
reason
stated
above
was
red
on
the
right
bank
we
made
our
camp
on
some
sand
at
the
mouth
of
a
gulch
and
immediately
put
on
our
dry
clothes
from
the
boats
not
far
below
on
the
same
side
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
vast
ruined
tower
around
the
indentations
which
answered
for
crumbling
windows
bunches
of
mosses
and
ferns
were
draped
while
from
the
side
about
one
hundred
feet
up
from
the
river
clear
springs
broke
forth
to
dash
down
amidst
verdure
in
silvery
skeins
the
whole
affair
formed
a
striking
and
unusual
picture
the
only
green
that
so
far
had
been
visible
in
the
canyon
landscape
for
the
walls
from
brink
to
river
were
absolutely
barren
of
trees
or
any
apparent
vegetation
on
the
former
trip
the
major
had
named
the
place
after
a
botanist
friend
of
his
vasey
vaysey
paradise
and
this
was
now
recorded
in
our
notes
all
day
long
we
had
seen
in
the
magnificent
walls
besides
caverns
and
galleries
resemblances
to
every
form
of
architectural
design
turrets
forts
balconies
castles
and
a
thousand
strange
and
fantastic
suggestions
from
the
dark
tower
against
which
childe
roland
with
his
blew
defiance
to
the
airy
structures
evolved
by
the
wonderful
lamp
of
aladdin
starting
down
again
on
wednesday
morning
we
ran
past
the
paradise
and
heard
a
little
bird
singing
there
amidst
the
spray
and
mosses
a
delicate
note
seeming
out
of
place
amidst
such
gigantic
desolation
only
the
boom
of
great
cannon
or
the
tone
of
some
enormous
organ
pipe
would
be
correct
with
the
surroundings
the
walls
at
the
water
edge
were
vertical
for
long
distances
up
to
eight
hundred
feet
and
being
now
in
all
about
three
thousand
feet
and
not
a
great
ways
apart
the
outlook
ahead
was
something
almost
overpowering
in
its
deep
suggestion
of
mysterious
and
untold
realms
to
come
on
the
first
voyage
it
would
have
been
easy
to
persuade
oneself
that
the
river
was
soon
to
become
subterranean
but
the
major
having
solved
the
enigma
we
could
look
with
indifference
on
the
threatening
prospect
yet
the
walls
nevertheless
seemed
to
have
a
determination
to
close
together
overhead
as
we
looked
down
the
descending
waters
before
us
with
cliff
mounting
on
cliff
and
the
distance
from
one
to
the
other
appearing
so
very
small
deep
and
sombre
were
the
shadows
at
the
bends
and
the
imagination
needed
no
spur
to
picture
there
rapids
falls
cataracts
of
giant
proportions
we
made
nearly
eleven
miles
and
ran
ten
very
big
rapids
meeting
with
no
accident
though
one
was
particularly
violent
and
filled
us
half
full
of
water
in
the
fierce
breakers
the
stage
of
water
was
exactly
right
for
this
stretch
a
lower
stage
would
certainly
have
given
us
far
more
trouble
our
stop
for
the
night
camp
was
made
on
a
wide
sandbank
on
the
left
with
some
mesquite
growing
nearby
our
first
acquaintance
with
this
tree
on
the
river
we
now
were
getting
on
so
well
and
were
so
comfortable
that
we
felt
quite
happy
and
jack
as
usual
entertained
us
with
several
songs
the
next
day
thursday
the
jack
and
clem
took
some
photographs
in
the
morning
and
i
hunted
fossils
for
the
major
in
the
limestone
shales
which
had
run
up
under
the
marble
by
nine
we
were
packed
up
again
in
our
usual
good
form
everything
in
the
rubber
sacks
hatches
firmly
battened
down
ready
and
we
set
forth
for
another
day
battle
there
were
numerous
large
rapids
and
the
impetuous
river
turbid
and
grim
rushed
down
with
a
continuity
that
kept
us
alert
every
instant
though
we
descended
with
terrific
velocity
nothing
gave
us
any
particular
trouble
before
dinner
which
we
ate
in
the
shade
of
a
mesquite
on
the
right
at
the
mouth
of
a
couple
of
giant
gulches
here
we
discovered
a
large
patch
of
cacti
loaded
with
the
red
prickly
pears
or
cactus
apples
as
we
called
them
they
were
ripe
seeming
to
me
to
be
half
way
between
a
fig
and
a
tomato
and
very
welcome
for
dessert
as
we
had
eaten
no
fresh
fruit
since
a
watermelon
brought
along
as
far
as
the
first
noon
camp
all
the
vegetation
was
different
from
that
of
the
upper
canyons
and
of
a
kind
indicating
a
hotter
climate
cacti
yucca
etc
in
the
afternoon
the
walls
became
greater
the
river
ran
swifter
the
descent
seemed
almost
without
a
break
for
rapid
followed
rapid
in
such
quick
succession
that
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
separate
them
one
from
another
at
times
we
could
barely
maintain
control
of
the
boats
so
powerful
and
uninterrupted
was
the
turbulent
sweep
of
the
great
narrow
flood
at
one
place
as
we
were
being
hurled
along
at
a
tremendous
speed
we
suddenly
perceived
immediately
ahead
of
us
and
in
such
a
position
that
we
could
not
avoid
dashing
into
it
a
fearful
commotion
of
the
waters
indicating
many
large
rocks
near
the
surface
the
major
stood
on
the
middle
deck
his
in
place
and
holding
by
his
left
hand
to
the
arm
of
the
well
secured
chair
to
prevent
being
thrown
off
by
the
lurching
of
the
boat
peered
into
the
approaching
maelstrom
it
looked
to
him
like
the
end
for
us
and
he
exclaimed
calmly
by
god
boys
we
gone
with
terrific
impetus
we
sped
into
the
seething
boiling
turmoil
expecting
to
feel
a
crash
and
to
have
the
crumble
beneath
us
but
instead
of
that
unfortunate
result
she
shot
through
smoothly
without
a
scratch
the
rocks
being
deeper
than
appeared
by
the
disturbance
on
the
surface
we
had
no
time
to
think
over
this
agreeable
delivery
for
on
came
the
rapids
or
rather
other
rough
portions
of
the
unending
declivity
requiring
instant
and
continuous
attention

the

were
required
only
for
steering
or
for
pulling
as
fast
as
we
could
to
avoid
some
bad
place
at
the
same
time
the
walls
constantly
gained
height
as
the
torrent
cut
down
its
bed
till
both
together
with
the
rapidity
of
our
movement
fairly
made
one

rising
in

perpendicular
faces

immediately
at

were

flanked
by

describe
this
particular
day
in

it
must
be
experienced
to
be
appreciated

i
will
not
strive
further
to
convey
my
impressions
as
the
sun
sank
to
the
western
edge
of
the
outer
world
we
were
rushing
down
a
long
straight
stretch
of
canyon
and
the
colossal
precipices
looming
on
all
sides
as
well
as
dead
ahead
across
our
pathway
positively
appeared
about
to
overwhelm
the
entire
river
by
their
ponderous
magnificence
burnished
at
their
summits
by
the
dying
sun
on
down
the
headlong
flood
our
faithful
boats
carried
us
to
the
gloom
that
seemed
to
be
the
termination
of
all
except
subterranean
progress
but
at
the
very
bottom
of
this
course
there
was
a
bend
to
the
west
and
we
found
ourselves
at
the
mouth
of
a
deep
side
canyon
coming
in
from
the
east
with
a
small
stream
flowing
into
the
big
river
this
was
the
mouth
of
the
little
colorado

the
end

more
wall
rising
vertically
from
the
water
edge
than
any
other
canyon
we
had
encountered
our
distance
for
the
day
was
eighteen
miles
with
eighteen
rapids
one
nearly
three
miles
long
and
all
following
each
other
so
closely
they
were
continuous
we
ran
seventeen
and
made
one
it
was
a
glorious
day
and
a
fitting
preparation
for
our
entrance
into
the
next
stupendous
canyon
which
the
major
styled
the
sockdologer
of
the
world
the
now
famous
grand
canyon
our
altitude
was
feet
giving
a
descent
in
the
and
miles
of
marble
canyon
of
feet
leaving
feet
still
to
be
overcome
before
we
could
reach
the
mouth
of
the
grand
wash
and
the
end
of
the
grand
canyon
i
counted

made

our
camp
was
on
the
left
bank
of
the
little
colorado
and
there
we
remained
for
friday
august
to
reconnoitre
the
neighbourhood
and
to
give
an
opportunity
to
get
the
latitude
and
longitude
the
little
colorado
was
a
red

about
sixty
feet
wide
and

deep

dry

but
the
water
otherwise
was
pure
the
river
had
been
rapidly
rising
for
several
days
and
was
still
coming
up
so
that
we
were
likely
to
have
in
the
grand
canyon
more
water
than
we
required
i
climbed
up
the
wall
on
the
north
side
of
the
little
colorado
thinking
i
might
be
able
to
reach
the
summit
but
when
about
up
i
met
vast
and
vertical
heights
that
were
impossible
and
returned
to
camp
the
next
morning
saturday
august
we
packed
up
and
entered
the
grand
canyon
proper
on
an
easy
river
making
about
five
miles
in
half
an
hour
and
putting
behind
six
rapids
all
small

at
the
head
of
one
that
was
more
threatening
here
a
little
creek
came
in
from
the
right
or
west
near
camp
the
canyon
was
wider
than
above
and
we
could
see
the
summits
around
that
were
six
thousand
feet
above
the
river
but
some
miles
back
in
the
morning
i
made
a
geological
sketch
and
in
the
afternoon
i
climbed
a
high
peak
and
put
in
some
of
the
topography
the
next
morning
we
crossed
the
river
to
examine
a
large
igneous
butte
where
we
found
a
small
vein
of
copper
ore
and
after
dinner
and
i
climbed
a
couple
of
peaks
and
did
some
triangulating
monday
the
found
us
still
at
camp
to
further
investigate
the
surroundings
and
the
major
jones
and
i
climbed
up
on
the
north
about
feet
in
order
to
get
a
better
idea
of
the
several
valleys
which
here
seemed
to
compose
the
bottom
of
the
great
chasm
and
did
not
reach
camp
till
after
dark
everything
now
developed
on
a
still
larger
and
grander
scale
we
saw
before
us
an
enormous
gorge
very
wide
at
the
top
which
could
engulf
an
ordinary
mountain
range
and
lose
it
within
its
vast
depths
and
ramifications
multitudinous
lofty
mesas
buttes
and
pinnacles
began
to
appear
each
a
mighty
mountain
in

the
greater
grandeur
of
the
cyclopean
environment
tuesday
august
after
had
put
a
new
tube
in
the
second
barometer
which
had
somehow
been
broken
we
pushed
off
once
more
to
see
what
the
day
would
develop
the
rapid
just
below
camp
we
ran
through
easily
and
then
made
swift
progress
for
seven
miles
running
nine
more
rapids
two
rather
bad
ones
the
grounded
once
on
a
shoal
but
got
off
without
damage
where
we
stopped
for
dinner
we
caught
sight
of
two
mountain
sheep
drinking
and
andy
and
i
got
our
guns
out
of
the
cabins
as
quickly
as
possible
and
started
after
them
but
they
flew
away
like
birds
of
the
air
near
this
point
there
was
a
small
abandoned
hut
of
mesquite
logs
we
went
into
camp
farther
down
on
the
left
for
investigations
the
major
and
i
going
up
the
river
and
finding
a
small
salty
creek
which
we
followed
for
a
time
on
an
old
trail
the
major
studying
the
geology
and
collecting
specimens
of
the
rocks
which
we
carried
back
to
camp
arriving
after
dark
the
geology
and
topography
here
were
complicated
and
particularly
interesting
and
we
ought
to
have
been
able
to
spend
more
days
but
the
food
question
as
well
as
time
was
a
determining
factor
in
our
movements
and
with
only
two
boats
our
rations
would
carry
us
with
necessary
stops
only
to
the
mouth
of
the
kanab
canyon
where
our
would
meet
us
on
september
there
was
no
other
place
above
diamond
creek
known
at
that
time
except
perhaps
the
spot
near
mount
trumbull
where
supplies
could
be
brought
in
on
wednesday
we
ran
two
or
three
miles
and
stopped
for
our
photographers
to
get
some
views
opposite
a
sandstone
we
also
had
dinner
at
this
place
and
then
continued
the
descent
after
running
four
rapids
successfully
making
a
at
another
and
a
portage
over
the
upper
end
of
a
sixth
we
were
ready
having
made
in
all
six
miles
to
go
into
camp
part
way
down
the
last
one
of
the
heaviest
falls
we
had
so
far
encountered
it
was
perhaps
half
a
mile
long
with
a
declivity
of
at
least
forty
feet
studded
by
numerous
enormous
boulders
a
heavy
rain
began
during
our
work
of
getting
below
and
our
clothes
being
already
wet
the
air
became
very
chilly
we
had
to
carry
the
cargoes
only
a
short
distance
with
no
climbing
and
there
was
ample
room
so
the
portage
was
not
difficult
in
that
respect
but
though
we
could
manoeuvre
the
empty
boats
down
along
the
shore
amidst
the
big
rocks
they
were
exceedingly
heavy
for
our
small
band
and
in
sliding
them
down
between
the
huge
masses
with
the
water
pouring
around
and
often
into
them
we
sometimes
had
as
much
as
we
could
do
to
manage
them
each
man
being
obliged
to
strain
his
muscle
to
the
limit
jack
from
this
cause
hurt
his
back
so
badly
that
he
could
not
lift
at
all
and
overcome
by
the
sudden
weakness
and
pain
he
came
near
sinking
into
the
swift
river
at
the
stern
of
the
where
he
happened
at
the
moment
to
be
working
i
heard
his
cry
and
clambered
over
to
seize
him
as
quickly
as
i
could
helping
him
to
shore
where
we
did
all
that
was
possible
for
his
comfort
as
we
were
going
no
farther
that
day
he
was
able
to
rest
and
in
the
morning
felt
much
better
though
his
back
was
still
weak
andy
took
his
place
in
our
boat
to
run
the
lower
end
of
the
rapid
which
was
easily
done
we
landed
below
on
the
same
side
enabling
andy
to
go
back
to
help
bring
down
the
while
jack
walked
along
the
rocks
to
where
we
were
here
we
remained
for
a
couple
of
hours
while
i
climbed
up
for
the
major
and
measured
the
red
beds
and
jack
rested
again
improving
very
fast
when
we
were
ready
to
go
on
his
trouble
had
almost
disappeared
illustration
the
grand
canyon
from
just
below
the
little
colorado
photograph
by
hillers
a
dark
granite
formation
had
run
up
at
the
foot
of
the
last
fall
and
it
rose
rapidly
higher
hemming
the
water
in
with
steep
forbidding
cliffs
close
together
the
river
became
much
narrower
and
swirled
with
an
current
around
the
buttresses
of
granite
that
thrust
themselves
from
one
side
or
the
other
into
it
the
declivity
was
not
great
and
the
torrent
was
otherwise
placid
after
three
miles
of
this
ominous
docility
just
as
the
dinner
hour
was
near
and
the
threatening
black
granite
had
risen
to
one
thousand
feet
above
the
water
we
heard
a
deep
sullen
roar
ahead
and
from
the
boats
the
whole
river
seemed
to
vanish
instantly
from
earth
at
once
we
ran
in
on
the
right
to
a
small
area
of
great
broken
rocks
that
protruded
above
the
water
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
stepping
out
on
these
we
could
look
down
on
one
of
the
most
fearful
places
i
ever
saw
or
ever
hope
to
see
under
like
circumstances
a
place
that
might
have
been
the
gate
to
hell
that
steward
had
mentioned
we
were
near
the
beginning
of
a
tremendous
fall
the
narrow
river
dropped
suddenly
and
smoothly
away
and
then
beaten
to
foam
plunged
and
boomed
for
a
third
of
a
mile
through
a
descent
of
from
eighty
to
one
hundred
feet
the
enormous
waves
leaping
twenty
or
thirty
feet
into
the
air
and
sending
spray
twice
as
high
on
each
side
were
the
steep
ragged
granitic
walls
with
the
tumultuous
waters
lashing
and
pounding
against
them
in
a
way
that
precluded
all
idea
of
portage
or
it
needed
no
second
glance
to
tell
us
that
there
was
only
one
way
of
getting
below
if
the
rocks
did
not
stop
us
we
could
cross
to
killiloo
and
when
a
driving
rain
had
ceased
andy
gathered
the
few
sticks
of
driftwood
available
for
a
fire
by
which
he
prepared
some
dinner
in
advance
of
the
experiment
jack
and
clem
took
three
negatives
and
when
the
dinner
was
disposed
of
we
stowed
all
loose
articles
snugly
away
in
the
cabins
except
a
in
each
to
bail
with
and
then
battening
down
the
hatches
with
extra
care
and
making
everything
shipshape
we
pulled
the
leaving
the
and
her
crew
to
watch
our
success
or
failure
and
profit
by
it
the
major
had
on
his
and
so
had
jones
but
jack
and
i
put
ours
behind
our
seats
where
we
could
catch
them
up
quickly
for
they
were
so
large
we
thought
they
impeded
the
handling
of
the
oars
jack
back
had
fortunately
now
recovered
so
that
he
was
able
to
row
almost
his
usual
stroke
we
pulled
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
close
to
the
wall
in
order
that
we
might
get
well
into
the
middle
of
the
river
before
making
the
great
plunge
and
then
we
turned
our
bow
out
and
secured
the
desired
position
as
speedily
as
possible
heading
down
upon
the
roaring
enemy
roaring
as
if
it
would
surely
swallow
us
at
one
gulp

sketch

by

dellenbaugh
my
back
being
towards
the
fall
i
could
not
see
it
for
i
could
not
turn
round
while
waiting
every
instant
for
orders
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
angry
tumult
the
major
shouted
back
water
there
was
a
sudden
dropping
away
of
all
support
then
the
mighty
waves
smote
us
the
boat
rose
to
them
well
but
we
were
flying
at
miles
an
hour
and
at
every
leap
the
breakers
rolled
over
us
bail
shouted
the
major
bail
for
your
lives
and
we
dropped
the
oars
to
bail
though
bailing
was
almost
useless
the
oars
could
not
get
away
for
they
had
rawhide
rings
nailed
around
near
the
handle
to
prevent
them
from
slipping
through
the
rowlocks
the
boat
rolled
and
pitched
like
a
ship
in
a
tornado
and
as
she
flew
along
jack
and
i
who
faced
backwards
could
look
up
under
the
canopies
of
foam
pouring
over
gigantic
black
boulders
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
why
we
did
not
land
on
top
of
one
of
these
and
turn
over
i
do
know
unless
it
might
be
that
the
very
fury
of
the
current
causes
a
recoil
however
that
may
be
we
struck
nothing
but
the
waves
the
boats
riding
finely
and
certainly
leaping
at
times
almost
half
their
length
out
of
water
to
bury
themselves
quite
as
far
at
the
next
lunge
if
you
will
take
a
watch
and
count
by
it
ninety
seconds
you
will
probably
have
about
the
time
we
were
in
this
chaos
though
it
seemed
much
longer
to
me
then
we
were
through
and
immediately
took
advantage
of
an
eddy
on
one
side
to
lie
to
and
bail
out
for
the
boat
was
full
of
water
setting
her
to
rights
as
quickly
as
we
could
we
got
ready
to
make
a
dash
for
the
crew
of
the
in
case
she
fared
worse
than
we
did
we
looked
anxiously
for
her
to
appear
and
presently
at
the
top
of
what
seemed
to
us
now
to
be
a
straight
wall
of
foam
her
small
white
bulk
hung
for
an
instant
and
then
vanished
from
our
sight
in
the
mad
flood
soon
appearing
at
the
bottom
uninjured
she
ran
in
to
where
we
were
waiting
the
being
lighter
than
our
boat
did
not
ship
as
much
water
as
in
some
other
places
and
altogether
we
agreed
that
notwithstanding
its
great
descent
and
furious
aspect
the
passage
was
not
more
difficult
than
we
had
made
in
several
previous
rapids
continuing
on
down
the
narrow
and
gloomy
granite
gorge
we
encountered
about
a
mile
farther
down
a
singular
rapid
which
turned
the
completely
around
about
four
we
found
ourselves
before
another
tremendous
fall
and
a
very
ugly
one
landing
on
the
left
we
discovered
that
to
be
the
wrong
side
and
crossed
over
to
a
little
cove
where
there
was
a
patch
of
gravel
surrounded
by
vertical
walls
the
crossing
being
easily
made
because
the
water
seemed
to
slacken
before
the
plunge
we
did
not
intend
to
run
the
place
if
it
could
be
avoided
and
the
south
side
gave
no
opportunity
whatever
for
a
portage
while
the
north
side
offered
no
very
easy
course
declared
this
to
be
one
of
the
worst
rapids
we
had
seen
and
we
were
now
about
two
hundred
feet
above
the
head
of
it
with
the
vertical
cliffs
between
immediately
at
the
beginning
of
the
drop
on
the
same
side
that
we
were
on
was
a
pile
of
boulders
and
our
plan
was
to
engineer
the
boats
by
lines
from
where
we
had
landed
down
to
these
rocks
from
which
we
believed
we
could
work
around
over
the
rocks
into
an
alcove
there
was
there
and
thence
go
down
till
we
reached
the
lower
part
of
the
descent
through
which
we
could
navigate
consequently
several
of
the
men
entered
one
boat
and
we
lowered
her
from
the
stern
of
the
second
as
far
as
her
line
would
reach
and
then
lowered
the
second
till
the
first
lodged
in
the
rocks
at
the
desired
point
at
the
head
of
the
fall
then
pulling
up
the
second
boat
we
who
had
remained
got
on
board
and
by
clinging
to
the
projections
of
the
wall
the
current
close
in
being
quite
slow
we
succeeded
in
arriving
alongside
the
first
boat
the
next
thing
was
to
get
around
into
the
alcove
the
sky
above
was
heavy
and
rain
began
to
come
down
steadily
making
the
dark
granite
blacker
and
intensifying
the
gloomy
character
of
the
locality
by
hard
work
we
finally
got
our
boats
across
the
rocks
and
down
about
two
hundred
feet
farther
into
a
cove
where
they
rested
easily
up
to
this
time
we
had
made
in
all
during
the
day
seven
and
miles
as
night
was
now
dropping
fast
we
had
to
make
camp
on
a
pile
of
broken
granite
where
a
close
search
yielded
an
armful
or
two
of
small
pieces
of
driftwood
all
wet
under
a
rock
several
dry
sticks
were
discovered
and
by
their
aid
a
fire
soon
blazed
up
by
which
the
indomitable
andy
proceeded
to
get
supper
there
was
no
use
changing
wet
clothes
for
dry
ones
from
the
rubber
bags
as
long
as
the
rain
fell
and
it
increased
till
water
was
dashing
off
the
walls
in
streams
the
thunder
roared
and
crashed
as
if
it
were
knocking
the
cliffs
about
to
rearrange
them
all
and
a
deluge
swept
down
in
which
andy
struggling
little
fire
died
with
hardly
a
sputter
the
only
thing
remaining
for
us
to
do
was
to
all
stand
with
our
backs
against
the
foot
of
the
wall
which
was
still
warm
from
the
day
and
wait
for
something
else
to
happen
the
seen
through
the
dim
and
dismal
light
was
a
tempestuous
lake
with
an
island
of
dough
in
it
while
andy
the
undaunted
stood
grimly
gazing
at
it
the
rain
dribbling
from
his
hat
and
shoulders
till
he
resembled
the
fabled
ferryman
of
the
river
styx
the
situation
was
so
ludicrous
that
every
one
laughed
and
the
weather
god
finding
that
we
were
not
downcast
slackened
the
downpour
immediately
then
we
put
some
oars
against
the
wall
and
stretched
a
paulin
to
protect
our
noble
chef
who
finally
got
the
wet
firewood
once
more
ignited
and
succeeded
in
getting
the
bread
almost
baked
and
the
coffee
nearly
hot
and
some
dried
peaches
almost
stewed
the
rain
ceasing
we
hurriedly
donned
dry
clothes
and
applied
ourselves
to
the
destruction
of
these
viands
which
tasted
better
than
might
be
imagined
each
man
then
took
his
blankets
and
selecting
rocks
that
in
his
judgment
were
the
softest
he
went
to
sleep
there
was
another
alcove
about
three
hundred
yards
below
our
camp
and
in
the
morning
friday
august
we
proceeded
to
work
our
way
down
to
this
several
men
clambering
along
a
ledge
about
feet
above
the
water
with
the
line
while
i
remained
each
time
in
the
boat
below
with
an
oar
to
keep
the
bow
in
against
the
wall
so
that
she
could
not
take
the
current
on
the
wrong
side
that
is
on
the
side
next
to
the
wall
and
cut
out
into
the
river
in
this
way
we
got
both
boats
down
to
the
alcove
whence
we
intended
to
pull
out
into
the
current
and
run
the
lower
portion
of
the
rapid
it
was
only
noon
when
we
reached
the
place
but
then
we
discovered
that
both
boats
had
been
so
pounded
that
they
badly
needed
repairs
in
fact
it
was
imperative
to
halt
there
for
this
purpose
and
we
hauled
them
out
on
a
patch
of
broken
rocks
thirty
or
forty
feet
square
filling
the
curve
of
the
alcove
and
bounded
by
vertical
rocks
and
the
river
while
at
work
on
them
we
happened
to
notice
that
the
river
was
rapidly
rising
and
setting
a
mark
the
rate
was
found
to
be
three
feet
an
hour
the
rocks
on
which
we
were
standing
and
where
all
the
cargo
was
lying
were
being
submerged
we
looked
around
for
some
way
to
get
up
the
cliff
as
it
was
now
too
late
to
think
of
leaving
about
fifteen
feet
above
the
top
of
the
rocks
on
which
we
were
working
there
was
a
shelf
five
or
six
feet
wide
to
which
some
of
the
men
climbed
and
we
passed
up
every
article
to
them
when
the
repairs
were
done
darkness
was
filling
the
great
gorge
by
means
of
lines
from
above
and
much
hard
lifting
we
succeeded
in
raising
the
boats
up
the
side
of
the
cliff
till
they
were
four
or
five
feet
above
the
highest
rocks
of
the
patch
on
which
we
stood
this
insured
their
safety
for
the
time
being
and
if
the
river
mounted
to
them
we
intended
to
haul
them
still
higher
the
next
thing
was
to
find
a
place
to
sleep
by
walking
out
on
a
ledge
from
the
shelf
where
our
goods
were
we
could
turn
a
jutting
point
above
the
rushing
river
by
clinging
closely
to
the
rocks
and
walk
back
on
a
shelf
on
the
other
side
to
a
considerable
area
of
finely
broken
rocks
thirty
feet
above
the
torrent
where
there
was
room
enough
for
a
camp
rain
fell
at
intervals
and
the
situation
was
decidedly
unpromising
while
andy
and
the
others
were
getting
the
cook
outfit
and
rations
around
the
point
i
climbed
the
cliffs
hunting
for
wood
i
found
small
pieces
of
driftwood
lodged
behind
mesquite
bushes
fully
one
hundred
feet
above
the
prevailing
stage
of
water
i
collected
quite
an
armful
of
mesquite
which
has
the
advantage
of
being
so
compact
that
it
makes
a
fire
hot
as
coal
and
little
is
needed
to
cook
by
supper
was
not
long
in
being
despatched
and
then
every
man
feeling
about
worn
out
we
put
on
dry
clothes
the
rain
having
ceased
and
went
to
sleep
on
the
rocks
before
doing
so
we
climbed
back
to
examine
the
boats
and
found
the
river
was
not
coming
up
farther
though
it
had
almost
completely
covered
the
rocks
saturday
the
of
august
was
about
the
gloomiest
morning
i
ever
saw
rain
was
falling
the
clouds
hung
low
over
our
heads
like
a
lid
to
the
chasm
in
the
black
funereal
granite
enclosing
us
while
the
roar
of
the
big
rapid
seemed
to
be
intensified
we
felt
like
rats
in
a
trap
eating
breakfast
as
quickly
as
possible
we
got
everything
together
again
on
the
shelf
and
lowered
the
boats
though
the
river
was
not
rising
it
beat
and
surged
into
the
cove
in
a
way
that
made
the
boats
jump
and
bounce
the
moment
they
touched
the
water
to
prevent
their
being
broken
by
pounding
one
man
at
each
steadied
them
while
the
others
passed
down
the
sacks
and
instrument
boxes
then
it
was
seen
that
either
a
new
leak
had
sprung
in
the
amidships
or
a
hole
had
not
been
caulked
for
a
stream
as
wide
as
two
fingers
was
spurting
into
the
middle
cabin
to
repair
her
now
meant
hauling
both
boats
back
against
the
side
of
the
cliff
and
spending
another
day
in
this
trap
with
the
chance
of
the
river
rising
much
higher
before
night
so
that
we
might
not
be
able
to
get
away
at
all
at
least
not
for
days
for
an
instant
the
major
thought
of
pulling
the
boats
out
again
but
as
his
quick
judgment
reviewed
the
conditions
he
exclaimed
by
god
start
load
up
it
was
the
rarest
thing
for
him
to
use
an
oath
and
i
remember
only
one
other
occasion
when
he
did
so
in
marble
canyon
when
he
thought
we
were
going
to
smash
we
threw
the
things
in
as
fast
as
we
could
jammed
a
bag
of
flour
against
the
leak
in
the
battened
down
the
hatches
threw
our
rifles
into
the
bottom
of
the
standing
rooms
where
the
water
and
sand
washed
unheeded
over
them
and
jumped
to
our
oars
the
crew
of
the
held
our
stern
till
the
bow
swung
out
into
the
river
and
then
at
the
signal
jack
and
i
laid
to
with
all
our
strength
to
shoot
clear
of
an
enormous
rock
about
fifty
feet
below
against
which
the
fierce
current
was
dashing
the
was
so
nearly
that
she
was
sluggish
in
responding
to
the
oars
but
we
swept
past
the
rock
safely
and
rolled
along
down
the
river
in
the
tail
of
the
rapid
with
barely
an
inch
of
gunwale
to
spare
in
fact
i
thought
the
boat
might
sink
as
soon
as
we
saw
a
narrow
talus
on
the
right
we
ran
in
and
landed
when
the
was
ready
to
start
one
of
clem
oars
could
not
be
found
and
had
to
delay
to
cut
down
one
of
the
extras
for
him
then
they
got
their
boat
up
as
far
as
they
could
and
while
and
andy
kept
her
from
pounding
to
pieces
clem
got
in
bailed
out
and
took
his
oars
then
climbed
in
at
the
stern
but
the
current
was
so
strong
that
it
pulled
andy
off
his
feet
and
he
was
just
able
to
get
on
the
boat
drifting
down
stern
first
toward
the
big
rock
concluded
to
let
the
stern
strike
and
then
try
to
throw
the
boat
around
into
the
river
by
this
time
andy
had
got
hold
of
his
oars
and
the
eddy
seemed
to
carry
them
some
feet
so
perverse
and
capricious
is
the
colorado
they
swung
the
bow
to
starboard
into
the
main
current
and
with
a
couple
of
strong
the
dreaded
rock
was
cleared
and
down
the
came
to
us
over
the
long
waves
like
a
hunted
deer
we
unloaded
the
and
pulled
her
out
for
repairs
but
it
was
after
four
when
we
were
able
to
go
on
again
with
a
fairly
tight
boat
then
for
eight
miles
the
river
was
a
continuous
rapid
broken
by
eight
heavy
falls
but
luckily
there
were
no
rocks
in
any
of
them
at
this
stage
of
water
and
we
were
able
to
dash
through
one
after
another
at
top
speed
stopping
only
once
for
examination
two
of
these
rapids
were
portages
on
the
former
trip
proving
the
ease
and
advantage
of
high
water
in
some
places
but
the
disadvantages
are
much
greater
through
a
very
narrow
canyon
on
the
right
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
pretty
creek
but
we
were
going
so
fast
the
view
was
brief
and
imperfect
at
we
ran
up
to
a
wide
sandbank
on
which
grew
a
solitary
willow
tree
and
there
camp
was
made
for
a
space
the
inner
canyon
was
much
wider
than
above
and
the
mouth
of
bright
angel
creek
was
just
below
us
a
locality
now
well
known
because
a
trail
from
the
hotel
tovar
on
the
south
rim
comes
down
at
this
point
the
name
was
applied
by
the
major
on
his
first
trip
to
offset
the
name
dirty
devil
applied
farther
up
illustration
the
grand
canyon
from
top
of
granite
south
side
near
bright
angel
creek
the
next
day
was
sunday
september
and
after
the
major
had
climbed
the
south
wall
for
observations
we
started
once
more
on
a
powerful
current
for
the
first
three
miles
there
was
a
continuous
rapid
with
no
opportunity
to
land
we
dashed
through
waves
that
tossed
us
badly
and
filled
the
boats
half
full
and
then
half
full
again
before
we
had
a
chance
to
bail
in
fifteen
minutes
we
made
the
three
miles
and
a
half
mile
more
to
arrive
at
a
heavy
rapid
which
we
ran
and
in
two
miles
reached
another
with
fearful
waves
which
we
also
ran
in
one
jones
was
overbalanced
by
his
oar
hitting
the
top
of
a
big
wave
behind
the
boat
and
he
was
knocked
out
he
clung
by
his
knees
and
hands
his
back
in
the
water
and
the
boat
careened
till
i
thought
she
would
go
over
we
could
not
move
to
help
him
without
upsetting
and
were
compelled
to
leave
him
to
his
own
resources
in
some
way
he
succeeded
in
scrambling
back
the
waves
were
tremendous
and
sometimes
seemed
to
come
from
all
directions
at
once
there
were
whirlpools
too
that
turned
us
round
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
prevent
it
the
river
was
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
wide
after
an
extremely
strenuous
morning
we
halted
on
the
right
for
dinner
continuing
as
soon
as
we
had
disposed
of
it
presently
we
arrived
at
a
sharp
fall
of
about
twenty
feet
where
we
made
a
portage
and
waited
at
the
foot
for
the
photographers
to
take
some
negatives
and
also
for
repairing
the
finally
it
was
decided
to
camp
on
the
spot
it
was
camp
our
record
for
the
day
was
a
trifle
over
seven
miles
with
nine
rapids
run
and
one
portage
almost
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
of
september
was
a
portage
after
which
we
had
fair
water
for
two
or
three
miles
and
then
reached
a
very
heavy
fall
where
we
landed
on
the
left
and
had
dinner
before
making
another
portage
this
accomplished
we
proceeded
on
a
river
still
rising
and
ran
a
great
many
bad
rapids
some
of
them
having
tremendous
falls
in
one
the
fierce
current
set
against
the
cliff
so
strongly
that
we
were
carried
within
an
oar
length
of
it
notwithstanding
our
severe
effort
to
avoid
so
close
an
acquaintance
with
the
rough
wall
even
between
rapids
the
velocity
of
the
water
was
extremely
high
and
we
flew
along
at
terrific
speed
while
in
the
huge
waves
of
the
rapids
the
boats
leaped
and
plunged
with
startling
violence
toward
night
a
sudden
halt
was
made
on
the
left
to
examine
a
place
half
a
mile
below
the
major
and
tried
to
climb
where
they
could
get
a
good
view
of
it
but
they
failed
the
major
said
we
would
run
it
in
the
morning
though
was
dubious
about
the
feasibility
of
doing
so
successfully
and
said
he
thought
it
about
the
worst
place
we
had
yet
seen
we
camped
on
a
rocky
talus
where
we
were
a
small
sandbank
was
found
nearby
for
our
beds
and
we
made
another
discovery
a
small
pool
of
clear
pure
water
a
rare
treat
after
the
muddy
colorado
which
we
had
been
drinking
for
so
long
twenty
rapids
were
placed
to
our
credit
for
this
one
day
in
a
trifle
over
fifteen
miles
and
we
felt
that
we
were
vanquishing
the
grand
canyon
with
considerable
success
our
life
now
was
so
strenuous
every
hour
of
the
day
that
our
songs
were
forgotten
and
when
night
came
every
man
was
so
used
up
that
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
rest
and
sleep
were
the
only
things
that
interested
us
though
our
beds
were
as
hard
and
rough
as
anything
could
be
we
slept
with
the
intensity
of
the
rocks
themselves
and
it
never
seemed
more
than
a
few
minutes
before
we
were
aroused
by
the
major
rising
signal
boys
and
rose
to
our
feet
to
pack
the
blankets
in
the
rubber
bags
sometimes
with
a
passing
thought
as
to
whether
we
would
ever
take
them
out
again
for
my
part
never
before
nor
since
have
i
been
so
tired
one
night
when
the
major
called
us
to
look
out
for
the
boats
i
did
not
hear
him
and
no
one
waked
me
so
i
slept
on
learning
about
it
only
the
next
morning
our
food
supply
was
composed
partly
of
jerked
beef
and
as
this
could
not
be
put
in
rubber
because
of
the
grease
it
became
more
or
less
damp
and
there
developed
in
it
a
peculiar
kind
of
worm
the
largest
about
an
inch
long
with
multitudinous
legs
there
were
a
great
many
of
them
and
they
gave
the
beef
a
queer
taste
in
order
to
clear
the
sacks
as
far
as
possible
of
these
undesirable
denizens
i
several
times
emptied
them
on
wide
smooth
rocks
and
while
the
worms
were
scrambling
around
i
scraped
up
the
beef
without
many
of
them
but
could
not
get
rid
of
all
andy
method
of
cooking
this
beef
was
to
make
a
gravy
with
bacon
fat
and
scorched
flour
and
then
for
a
few
moments
stew
the
beef
in
the
gravy
ordinarily
this
made
a
very
palatable
dish
but
the
peculiar
flavour
of
the
beef
now
detracted
from
it
though
we
were
so
hungry
that
we
could
eat
anything
without
a
query
and
our
diminishing
supply
of
rations
forbade
the
abandonment
of
the
valuable
beef
when
we
arose
on
the
morning
of
september
the
dubious
rapid
was
tossing
its
huge
waves
exactly
as
on
the
night
before
and
humanity
seemed
to
be
out
of
the
reckoning
by
eight
we
were
ready
for
it
and
with
everything
in
good
trim
we
pushed
off
the
current
was
strong
from
the
start
and
a
small
rapid
just
below
camp
gave
additional
speed
so
that
we
were
soon
bearing
down
on
the
big
one
with
wild
velocity
the
river
dropped
away
abruptly
to
rise
again
in
a
succession
of
fearful
billows
whose
crests
leaped
and
danced
high
in
air
as
if
rejoicing
at
the
prospect
of
annihilating
us
just
then
the
major
changed
his
mind
as
to
running
the
place
for
now
standing
on
the
deck
he
could
see
it
better
than
before
from
the
region
of
our
camp
he
ordered
us
to
pull
hard
on
our
left
intending
to
land
at
a
spot
that
was
propitious
on
the
left
or
south
bank
but
no
sooner
had
he
given
this
command
than
he
perceived
that
no
landing
above
the
fall
was
possible
he
gave
another
order
which
put
us
straight
in
the
middle
again
and
down
we
flew
upon
the
descent
the
major
as
usual
had
put
on
his
and
i
think
jones
had
on
his
but
jack
and
i
as
was
our
custom
placed
ours
inflated
immediately
behind
our
seats
not
wishing
to
be
hampered
by
them
the
plunge
was
exceedingly
sharp
and
deep
and
then
we
found
ourselves
tossing
like
a
chip
in
a
frightful
chaos
of
breakers
which
almost
buried
us
though
the
boats
rose
to
them
as
well
as
any
craft
possibly
could
i
bailed
with
a
camp
kettle
rapidly
and
jack
did
the
same
but
the
boat
remained
full
to
the
gunwales
as
we
were
swept
on
we
had
passed
the
worst
of
it
when
just
as
the
mounted
a
giant
wave
at
an
angle
perhaps
of
forty
or
fifty
degrees
the
crest
broke
in
a
deluge
against
the
port
bow
with
a
loud
slap
in
an
instant
we
were
going
over
to
starboard
i
threw
up
my
hand
instinctively
to
grasp
something
and
luckily
caught
hold
of
a
spare
oar
which
was
carried
slung
on
the
side
and
by
this
means
i
pulled
myself
above
water
my
hat
was
pasted
down
over
my
eyes
freeing
myself
from
this
i
looked
about
bottom
up
the
boat
was
clear
of
the
rapid
and
sweeping
on
down
with
the
swift
boiling
current
toward
a
dark
bend
the
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
no
living
thing
was
visible
the
narrow
black
gorge
rose
in
sombre
majesty
to
the
everlasting
sky
what
was
a
mere
human
life
or
two
in
the
span
of
eternity
i
was
about
preparing
to
climb
up
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
when
i
perceived
jones
clinging
to
the
ring
in
the
stern
and
in
another
second
the
major
and
jack
shot
up
alongside
as
if
from
a
gun
the
whole
party
had
been
kept
together
in
a
kind
of
whirlpool
and
the
major
and
jack
had
been
pulled
down
head
first
till
as
is
the
nature
of
these
suctions
on
the
colorado
it
suddenly
changed
to
an
upward
force
and
threw
them
out
into
the
air
there
was
no
time
to
lose
for
we
did
not
wish
to
go
far
in
this
condition
another
rapid
might
be
in
waiting
around
the
corner
jack
and
i
carefully
got
up
on
the
bottom
leaving
the
major
at
the
bow
and
jones
at
the
stern
and
leaning
over
we
took
hold
of
the
starboard
gunwale
under
water
and
throwing
ourselves
back
quickly
together
we
brought
the
up
on
her
keel
though
she
came
near
rolling
clear
over
the
other
way
she
was
even
full
of
water
but
the
cabins
supported
her
jack
helped
me
in
and
then
i
balanced
his
effort
so
as
not
to
capsize
again
the
bailing
kettles
were
gone
but
as
our
hats
had
strangely
enough
remained
on
our
heads
through
it
all
we
bailed
with
them
as
fast
as
possible
for
a
few
seconds
till
we
lowered
the
water
sufficiently
to
make
it
safe
to
get
the
others
on
board
the
major
came
aft
along
the
gunwale
and
i
helped
him
in
then
jack
helped
jones
the
oars
fortunately
had
not
come
out
of
the
locks
thanks
to
our
excellent
arrangement
and
grasping
them
without
trying
to
haul
in
the
bow
line
trailing
a
hundred
feet
in
the
water
we
pulled
hard
for
a
slight
eddy
on
the
left
where
we
perceived
a
footing
on
the
rocks
and
as
soon
as
we
were
near
enough
i
caught
up
the
rope
made
the
leap
and
threw
the
bight
over
a
projection
where
i
held
the
boat
while
jack
and
jones
bailed
rapidly
and
set
things
in
order
so
that
we
could
go
to
the
assistance
of
the
the
major
jurgenssen
chronometer
had
stopped
at
from
the
wetting
the
being
more
lightly
laden
than
the
and
also
not
meeting
the
peculiar
coincidence
of
mounting
a
wave
at
the
instant
it
broke
came
down
with
no
more
damage
than
the
loss
of
three
oars
and
the
breaking
of
a
rowlock
probably
if
the
major
had
sat
down
on
the
deck
instead
of
in
the
chair
we
might
also
have
weathered
the
storm
about
a
mile
and
a
half
below
we
made
a
landing
at
a
favourable
spot
on
the
right
where
the
cargoes
were
spread
out
to
dry
and
the
boats
were
overhauled
while
the
major
and
i
climbed
up
the
wall
to
where
he
desired
to
make
a
geological
investigation
we
joked
him
a
good
deal
about
his
zeal
in
going
to
examine
the
geology
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
came
near
departing
by
that
road
to
another
world
we
were
now
in
an
exceedingly
difficult
part
of
the
granite
gorge
for
at
the
prevailing
stage
of
water
landings
were
either
highly
precarious
or
not
possible
at
all
so
we
could
not
examine
places
before
running
and
could
not
always
make
a
portage
where
we
deemed
it
necessary
there
were
also
all
manner
of
whirlpools
and
bad
places
starting
on
about
three
we
descended
several
rapids
in
about
six
miles
when
we
saw
one
ahead
that
looked
particularly
forbidding
the
granite
came
down
almost
vertically
to
the
water
projecting
in
huge
buttresses
that
formed
a
succession
of
little
bays
especially
on
the
left
where
we
manoeuvred
in
and
out
keeping
close
against
the
rocks
the
current
there
being
slack
the
plan
was
for
me
to
be
ready
on
turning
the
last
point
to
jump
out
on
some
rocks
we
had
noticed
from
above
not
far
from
the
beginning
of
the
rapid
as
we
crept
around
the
wall
i
stood
up
with
the
bight
of
the
line
in
one
hand
while
jack
pulled
in
till
we
began
to
drift
down
stern
foremost
alongshore
at
the
proper
moment
i
made
my
leap
exactly
calculated
unluckily
at
the
instant
the
capricious
colorado
threw
a
boil
up
between
the
bow
and
the
flat
rock
i
was
aiming
at
turning
the
bow
out
several
feet
and
instead
of
landing
where
i
intended
i
disappeared
in
deep
water
i
clung
to
the
line
and
the
acceleration
of
the
boat
descent
quickly
pulled
me
back
to
the
surface
she
was
gliding
rapidly
past
more
rocks
and
the
major
jumped
for
them
with
the
purpose
of
catching
the
rope
but
they
were
so
isolated
and
covered
with
rushing
water
that
he
had
all
he
could
do
to
take
care
of
himself
jones
then
tried
the
same
thing
but
with
the
same
result
jack
stuck
to
his
post
i
went
hand
over
hand
to
the
bow
as
fast
as
i
could
and
reaching
the
gunwale
i
was
on
board
in
a
second
one
of
my
oars
had
somehow
come
loose
but
jack
had
caught
it
and
now
handed
it
to
me
we
took
our
places
and
surveyed
the
chances
apparently
we
were
in
for
running
the
rapid
stern
foremost
and
we
prepared
for
it
but
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
there
was
a
rock
of
most
gigantic
proportions
sloping
up
the
river
in
such
a
way
that
the
surges
alternately
rolled
upon
it
and
then
slid
back
partly
up
the
slope
we
were
drawn
by
this
power
and
on
the
down
rush
the
boat
turned
and
headed
diagonally
just
right
for
reaching
the
left
bank
we
saw
our
opportunity
and
pulling
with
every
muscle
lodged
the
behind
a
huge
boulder
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
main
rapid
where
i
made
the
line
fast
in
the
twinkle
of
an
eye
meanwhile
the
major
had
hastily
scrambled
up
to
where
he
could
see
down
the
canyon
and
he
heard
jack
hearty
shout
of
all
right
lowering
the
a
couple
of
rods
farther
to
a
sandbank
at
the
mouth
of
a
gulch
we
went
into
camp
feeling
that
we
had
done
enough
river
work
for
one
day
and
the
crew
without
accident
lowered
down
to
the
same
place
before
andy
had
supper
ready
my
hat
had
come
off
in
my
deep
plunge
and
beyond
this
i
did
not
have
one
near
by
was
a
small
clear
spring
that
gave
us
another
treat
of
palatable
water
the
colorado
now
being
muddier
than
ever
as
it
was
still
on
the
rise
coming
up
three
feet
more
while
we
were
here
the
entire
day
run
was
eight
and
miles
the
major
and
succeeded
in
getting
down
three
miles
on
foot
to
reconnoitre
illustration
the
grand
canyon
character
of

in

photograph
by
dellenbaugh
continuing
in
the
morning
september
we
lowered
the
boats
past
the
remainder
of
the
rapid
and
then
shoved
out
into
the
terrific
current
once
more
water
could
hardly
run
faster
than
it
now
did
except
in
a
fall
or
rapid
the
canyon
was
narrow
and
for
five
miles
we
encountered
the
worst
whirlpools
we
had
anywhere
seen
the
descent
was
swift
and
continuous
but
the
river
was
broken
only
by
the
whirlpools
and
boils
as
we
called
them
the
surface
suddenly
seeming
to
boil
up
and
run
over
these
upshoots
as
a
rule
seemed
to
follow
whirlpools
in
the
latter
the
water
for
a
diameter
of
twenty
or
feet
would
revolve
around
a
centre
with
great
rapidity
the
surface
inclining
to
the
vortex
the
top
of
which
was
perhaps
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
lower
than
the
general
level
the
vortex
itself
was
perfectly
formed
like
a
large
funnel
and
about
six
or
eight
inches
in
diameter
where
it
began
to
be
a
hole
in
the
water
tapering
thence
down
in
four
or
five
feet
to
a
mere
point
the
same
effect
is
often
seen
when
the
water
is
flowing
out
of
a
round
through
a
pipe
at
the
bottom
these
were
the
most
perfect
whirlpools
i
have
ever
seen
those
above
having
been
lacking
in
so
distinct
a
vortex
there
were
many
and
we
could
often
see
them
ahead
but
try
as
we
would
to
cleave
through
without
a
complete
revolution
or
two
of
the
boat
we
could
not
do
it
the
boats
sank
down
into
the
hollow
enabling
one
to
look
over
the
side
into
the
spinning
opening
but
the
boats
being
almost
as
long
as
the
whirlpool
usual
diameter
could
not
be
pulled
in
and
we
were
not
alarmed
we
found
it
rather
interesting
to
see
if
we
could
get
through
without
turning
but
we
never
did
any
ordinary
short
object
or
one
that
could
be
tipped
on
end
would
surely
go
out
of
sight
so
furious
ran
the
river
along
this
stretch
that
we
found
it
impossible
to
stop
the
boats
being
like
bits
of
paper
in
a
swinging
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
whirling
round
and
round
as
we
were
swept
along
between
the
narrow
walls
till
we
ran
the
granite
under
about
five
miles
from
our
last
camp
finally
after
a
run
all
told
of
fourteen
miles
with
rapids
we
made
camp
with
walls
of
friendly
sandstone
about
us
here
again
we
discovered
a
small
clear
spring
for
drinking
and
cooking
purposes
there
was
no
rain
this
day
and
at
night
we
put
on
our
dry
clothes
with
confidence
and
had
a
warm
comfortable
camp
with
a
good
sound
sleep
thursday
morning
found
us
early
on
the
river
which
to
our
surprise
turned
suddenly
in
a
direction
when
we
had
gone
about
nine
miles
and
had
run
the
granite
up
and
down
again
it
began
to
turn
to
the
west
at
one
point
the
river
was
not
more
than
fifty
feet
wide
the
current
was
everywhere
exceedingly
strong
and
there
were
many
rapids
of
which
we
ran
twelve
and
made
a
portage
at
another
and
a
at
still
another
we
camped
at
the
end
of
the
nine
miles
on
a
small
sandbank
with
the
total
height
of
walls
about
four
thousand
feet
breaking
back
in
terraces
after
about
eight
hundred
feet
clem
and
jack
made
a
number
of
photographs
wherever
practicable
and
altogether
they
had
succeeded
in
securing
a
representative
collection
during
the
morning
of
friday
september
we
ran
two
rapids
in
two
miles
which
brought
us
to
one
which
we
thought
required
a
and
we
made
it
as
it
was
easy
jack
and
clem
busied
themselves
photographing
while
we
were
doing
it
and
we
also
had
dinner
here
about
two
we
went
on
and
in
less
than
three
miles
ran
four
rapids
the
fourth
being
an
exceedingly
heavy
fall
at
the
foot
of
which
we
went
into
camp
on
the
right
bank
a
little
distance
above
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
was
a
fine
clear
cold
creek
larger
than
the
paria
in
quantity
of
water
we
called
it
tapeats
creek
because
a
pai
ute
of
that
name
who
had
pointed
it
out
to
the
major
from
the
kaibab
claimed
it
during
the
day
the
work
had
been
far
less
strenuous
there
were
few
whirlpools
the
river
was
falling
and
it
was
in
every
way
much
easier
than
above
in
the
granite
a
morning
was
spent
at
tapeats
creek
for
examinations
and
we
found
there
some
ancient
house
ruins
not
far
up
the
side
canyon
i
discovered
a
fine
large
metate
or
indian
mill
deeply
hollowed
out
and
foolishly
attempted
to
take
it
to
camp
on
arriving
there
it
was
so
heavy
i
had
to
drop
it
and
it
broke
in
two
much
to
the
major
disgust
who
told
me
i
ought
to
have
let
it
alone
a
fact
which
i
realised
then
also
our
rations
were
now
running
very
low
again
for
we
had
taken
more
days
for
this
passage
than
were
planned
and
as
soon
as
we
launched
forth
after
dinner
we
began
to
look
longingly
for
the
mouth
of
kanab
canyon
and
the
the
river
was
much
easier
in
every
respect
and
after
our
experience
of
the
previous
days
it
seemed
mere
play
the
granite
ran
up
for
a
mile
or
two
but
then
we
entered
sedimentary
strata
and
came
to
a
pretty
little
cascade
falling
through
a
crevice
on
the
right
from
a
valley
hidden
behind
a
low
wall
we
at
once
recognised
it
as
one
which
beaman
had
photographed
when
he
and
riley
had
made
their
way
up
along
the
rocks
from
the
mouth
of
the
kanab
during
the
winter
we
remembered
that
they
had
called
it
ten
miles
to
the
kanab
from
this
place
and
after
we
had
climbed
up
to
examine
what
they
had
named
surprise
valley
we
went
on
expecting
to
reach
the
kanab
before
night
running
several
small
and
one
fairly
large
rapid
we
saw
after
twelve
miles
from
the
last
camp
a
seeming
crack
on
the
right
and
a
few
seconds
later
heard
a
wild
yelling
in
a
little
while
we
landed
and
lowered
to
the
head
of
a
rapid
and
running
to
the
right
up
the
backwater
into
the
mouth
of
the
kanab
canyon
we
found
george
adair
nathan
adams
and
joe
hamblin
our
three
faithful
packers
waiting
there
for
us
with
the
rations
they
had
grown
very
anxious
for
we
were
several
days
overdue
and
they
feared
we
had
been
destroyed
a
fear
that
was
emphasised
by
one
of
andy
discarded
shirts
washing
ashore
at
their
feet
we
pulled
the
boats
a
short
distance
up
the
kanab
on
the
backwater
and
made
a
comfortable
camp
on
its
right
bank
where
we
were
soon
lost
in
letters
and
papers

brought
down

the

the
day
following
our
arrival
at
the
mouth
of
the
kanab
canyon
was
sunday
september
and
with
the
exception
of
some
observations
taken
by
and
the
writing
of
notes
the
whole
camp
was
in
a
state
of
rest
after
our
trying
work
in
the
granite
we
enjoyed
immensely
the
lying
around
warm
and
dry
with
plenty
to
eat
monday
morning
everybody
expected
to
begin
preparations
for
the
descent
to
the
grand
we
were
surprised
just
as
we
were
about
to
rise
from
our
places
around
the
canvas
on
which
breakfast
had
been
spread
when
the
major
who
was
sitting
in
his
chair
thinking
suddenly
exclaimed
well
boys
our
voyage
is
done
in
a
way
these
words
were
a
disappointment
for
we
all
wanted
to
complete
the
task
and
we
were
entirely
ready
to
go
on
notwithstanding
that
our
recent
experience
with
high
water
in
the
granite
indicated
great
hazard
ahead
where
there
was
more
granite
but
on
the
whole
the
disappointment
was
agreeable
we
knew
the
second
granite
gorge
toward
the
lower
end
of
the
chasm
to
be
nearly
as
bad
as
the
first
one
there
was
besides
one
exceedingly
difficult
passage
there
which
called
catastrophe
rapid
where
the
howlands
and
dunn
had
left
the
first
party
which
on
the
prevailing
stage
of
water
the
major
believed
would
be
foolhardy
to
attempt
in
his
diary
says
it
is
nonsense
to
think
of
trying
the
lower
bend
with
this
water
he
and
the
major
had
talked
the
matter
over
saturday
night
and
thought
of
stopping
about
forty
miles
down
at
mount
trumbull
where
we
knew
we
could
climb
out
then
they
thought
of
sending
only
one
boat
that
far
but
by
sunday
night
they
decided
to
end
all
river
work
here
said
he
could
map
the
course
from
the
notes
of
the
first
party
and
that
he
would
rather
explore
the
adjacent
country
by
land
there
were
some
breaks
in
the
notes
from
here
down
to
catastrophe
rapid
due
to
the
fact
that
when
the
papers
were
divided
on
that
memorable
day
on
which
the
howlands
and
dunn
left
the
party
instead
of
each
division
having
a
full
copy
of
all
the
notes
by
a
mistake
they
had
only
portions
of
both
sets
in
addition
to
the
difficulty
of
the
forbidding
catastrophe
rapid
there
was
a
possibility
of
an
attack
on
us
by
the
shewits
jacob
through
one
of
his
pai
ute
friends
had
information
that
they
were
preparing
to
lay
an
ambush
and
he
sent
warning
to
that
effect
jacob
knew
the
natives
too
well
to
have
given
us
this
notice
unless
he
thought
it
a
real
danger
but
we
did
not
allow
it
much
consideration
at
the
time
yet
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
for
the
shewits
to
secrete
themselves
where
they
could
fall
upon
us
in
the
night
when
we
were
used
up
by
working
through
some
bad
rapid
and
then
hiding
the
goods
throw
our
bodies
into
the
river
and
burn
the
boats
or
even
turn
them
loose
thus
leaving
no
proof
of
their
action
our
disappearance
naturally
being
laid
to
destruction
by
the
river
a
termination
generally
anticipated
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
when
they
killed
the
howlands
and
dunn
they
did
it
deliberately
to
get
their
guns
and
clothes
thinking
it
would
not
be
found
out
or
at
least
that
they
could
put
forth
a
good
excuse
as
they
did
illustration
the
grand
canyon
at
a
rapid
low
water
we
were
in
the
field
to
accomplish
certain
work
and
not
to
perform
a
spectacular
feat
and
the
major
and
having
decided
that
the
descent
of
the
remainder
of
the
canyon
considering
all
the
circumstances
was
for
us
impracticable
and
unnecessary
we
prepared
to
leave
for
kanab
we
unpacked
the
good
old
boats
rather
reluctantly
they
had
come
to
possess
a
personality
as
such
inanimate
objects
will
having
been
our
faithful
companions
and
our
reliance
for
many
a
hundred
difficult
miles
and
it
seemed
like
desertion
to
abandon
them
so
carelessly
to
destruction
we
ought
to
have
had
a
funeral
pyre
the
flags
of
the
boats
which
thompson
had
made
and
which
had
been
carried
in
them
the
entire
way
were
still
to
be
disposed
of
and
that
of
the
was
generously
voted
to
me
by
the
major
jack
and
jones
who
had
crew
claims
to
it
that
of
the
was
awarded
to
steward
while
clem
received
the
i
tried
to
persuade
the
major
to
pack
the
out
in
sections
and
send
her
east
to
be
kept
as
a
souvenir
of
the
voyage
but
he
would
not
then
listen
to
it
though
years
later
he
admitted
that
he
regretted
not
taking
my
suggestion
three
years
afterward
i
came
back
to
this
place
with
my
own
party
and
would
then
have
executed
my
desire
but
no
trace
of
our
former
outfit
remained
except
a
hatch
from
one
of
the
middle
cabins
and
the
chair
the
latter
i
carried
to
salt
lake
where
i
presented
it
to
cap
who
was
living
there
as
before
mentioned
the
colorado
was
so
extremely
high
that
the
water
backed
up
into
the
kanab
canyon
and
it
was
there
that
we
left
the
boats
each
tied
to
an
oar
stuck
in
the
ground
we
could
not
get
all
the
goods
on
the
horses
of
the
and
left
a
portion
to
be
brought
out
later
jack
and
clem
remained
to
make
photographs
and
taking
a
last
look
at
the
boats
with
a
to
all
we
turned
our
faces
up
the
narrow
chasm
of
the
kanab
a
small
stream
ran
in
the
bottom
and
this
formed
large
pools
amongst
numerous
ponderous
boulders
that
had
fallen
in
from
the
top
of
the
walls
some
three
thousand
feet
above
our
heads
the
bottom
being
hardly
more
than
sixty
to
feet
wide
it
was
with
considerable
difficulty
that
we
got
the
animals
past
some
of
these
places
and
in
one
or
two
the
pools
were
so
long
and
deep
they
had
to
swim
a
little
the
prospectors
the
year
before
had
worked
a
trail
to
some
extent
but
here
where
the
floods
ran
high
at
times
changes
occurred
frequently
by
five
we
had
gone
about
eight
miles
up
this
slow
rough
way
and
arrived
at
a
singular
spring
where
we
went
into
camp
this
we
called
spring
the
water
charged
with
lime
had
built
out
from
the
wall
a
mass
covered
by
ferns
which
was
cut
away
below
by
the
floods
till
one
could
walk
under
in
the
sprinkling
streams
percolating
through
it
it
was
a
very
pretty
place
but
like
all
of
its
kind
in
the
deep
gorges
it
was
a
favourite
resort
for
tarantulas
many
of
which
we
had
seen
in
the
depths
of
the
grand
canyon
these
with
scorpions
rattlesnakes
and
were
the
poisonous
reptiles
of
the
gorge

below

climbed
out
to
the
north
and
were
killed
near
mt
dellenbaugh
the
next
morning
tuesday
the
of
september
our
was
early
on
the
way
the
walls
grew
somewhat
lower
though
still
two
thousand
feet
high
and
the
canyon
was
usually
to
one
hundred
feet
wide
at
the
bottom
there
were
patches
of
alluvial
deposit
now
along
the
sides
of
the
watercourse
covered
by
fields
of
cactus
loaded
with
apples
the
prickly
leaves
compelling
us
to
keep
the
trail
the
prospectors
had
made
by
their
passage
to
and
from
the
ephemeral
eldorado
after
a
time
we
emerged
from
the
lower
canyon
into
a
wider
one
in
the
way
previously
described
that
is
like
going
from
one
floor
to
another
by
an
incline
between
narrow
walls
the
little
stream
having
vanished
a
pool
of
helped
us
out
for
dinner
and
while
it
was
preparing
and
i
climbed
up
to
secure
notes
on
the
topography
a
trifle
before
sunset
we
arrived
at
the
cedar
tree
a
short
distance
below
the
mouth
of
the
shinumo
canyon
where
our
party
had
camped
the
previous
march
the
pockets
were
full
of
clear
fresh
water
and
we
had
plenty
for
horses
as
well
as
men
not
far
off
some
human
bones
were
found
old
and
bleached
we
thought
they
must
be
the
remains
of
one
of
the
navajo
raiders
who
escaped
wounded
from
the
mormon
attack
near
this
locality
the
canyon
bottom
was
quite
wide
at
this
point
and
comparatively
level
covered
by
rushes
and
grass
and
the
horses
were
able
to
get
a
good
meal
during
the
day
every
time
i
dismounted
to
take
compass
bearings
on
the
trail
i
felt
a
sharp
peculiar
pain
shoot
up
my
right
leg
from
in
front
about
between
ankle
and
knee
i
could
only
discover
a
small
red
spot
at
the
initial
point
and
concluded
that
i
must
have
struck
a
sharp
rock
or
cactus
spine
our
party
now
again
divided
the
major
and
jones
going
up
shinumo
canyon
to
the
kaibab
region
while
and
i
rode
on
up
the
kanab
canyon
starting
at
eight
in
the
morning
wednesday
september
and
riding
steadily
all
day
as
we
had
not
expected
to
come
out
in
this
way
saddles
were
scarce
and
the
major
had
two
of
the
three
used
by
the
packers
while
the
third
was
awarded
to
jones
who
was
to
have
a
long
ride
on
the
kaibab
trip
the
rest
of
us
had
to
make
shift
as
we
could
and
i
rigged
up
a
sawbuck
with
rope
loops
for
stirrups
and
a
blanket
across
it
to
sit
on
this
was
not
much
better
than
or
as
good
perhaps
as
bareback
and
the
horse
was
a
very
hard
trotter
we
wished
to
reach
kanab
that
night
we
kept
on
at
as
rapid
a
gait
as
the
canyon
would
permit
though
it
was
easier
than
in
march
when
the
numerous
miners
had
not
yet
broken
a
way
by
their
ingress
and
egress
in
search
of
the
fabulous
gold
that
was
supposed
to
exist
somewhere
in
the
inaccessibility
of
the
great
chasm
the
harder
a
locality
is
to
arrive
at
the
bigger
the
stories
of
its
wealth
while
often
in
the
attempts
to
reach
it
the
prospector
treads
heedlessly
ground
that
holds
fortunes
up
to
his
very
eyes
we
continued
straight
up
kanab
canyon
the
walls
running
lower
and
lower
till
there
was
nothing
but
rounded
hills
then
we
emerged
on
the
summit
which
was
a
valley
bottom
about
twenty
miles
from
kanab
shortly
after
dark
we
halted
for
a
bite
to
eat
and
a
brief
rest
before
striking
for
our
old
storehouse
a
log
cabin
in
jacob
corral
where
we
arrived
about
eleven
having
made
about
forty
miles
i
collected
all
the
blankets
i
could
find
and
throwing
them
on
the
inside
of
jacob
garden
fence
i
was
almost
immediately
asleep
and
knew
nothing
till
jacob
came
along
and
said
a
my
ablutions
over
i
went
to
sister
to
breakfast
with
and
thompson
the
gardens
were
now
yielding
an
abundance
of
fresh
fruits
peaches
melons
and
i
blessed
the
good
management
and
foresight
that
directed
the
immediate
planting
of
these
things
in
a
mormon
settlement
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
not
get
my
fill

of

crossed
at

crossing
far
north
of

which
was
barely
known
before
friday
the
the
next
day
was
my
birthday
and
thompson
who
was
always
striving
to
do
something
to
make
our
circumstances
pleasant
prepared
a
large
peach
pie
with
her
own
hands
in
celebration
the
major
and
jones
having
come
in
the
night
before
we
passed
most
of
the
time
that
day
in
a
large
tent
eating
melons
the
major
acting
as
carver
of
the
fruit
when
we
had
eaten
a
watermelon
he
would
declare
that
he
thought
muskmelon
far
better
we
all
agreed
he
would
cut
one
only
to
find
when
we
had
eaten
it
that
we
had
changed
our
minds
and
wanted
watermelon
which
opinions
we
kept
up
till
all
the
melons
were
gone
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
one
who
had
not
had
our
canyon
fare
to
appreciate
the
exhilarating
effect
of
this
fresh
fruit
my
leg
which
had
developed
the
pain
coming
up
the
kanab
canyon
now
swelled
till
it
was
almost
the
same
size
throughout
and
any
pressure
made
an
imprint
as
in
a
piece
of
putty
no
one
knew
what
to
make
of
it
i
rode
over
to
johnson
that
person
being
the
nearest
to
a
doctor
of
any
one
in
the
country
though
the
mormons
do
not
much
believe
in
medicines
and
he
gave
me
a
liniment
to
apply
this
did
no
good
in
a
few
days
the
swelling
disappeared
except
where
the
spot
of
keen
pain
was
and
there
a
lump
was
left
half
as
large
as
a
man
fist
with
two
small
red
spots
in
the
middle
of
it
i
now
concluded
that
these
spots
marked
the
bite
of
a
tarantula
that
must
have
gotten
in
my
blankets
at
spring
suppuration
set
in
at
the
spots
where
the
flesh
turned
black
and
all
the
men
said
it
was
a
wound
they
thought
i
would
lose
my
leg
i
concluded
to
poultice
it
to
draw
out
any
poison
that
remained
and
kept
applied
continuously
after
a
while
it
seemed
to
have
a
tendency
to
heal
we
ran
the
base
line
up
through
kanab
and
at
the
head
of
it
pitched
a
small
observatory
tent
over
a
stone
foundation
on
which
prof
set
up
a
large
transit
instrument
for
stellar
observations
he
got
in
connection
by
the
telegraph
with
salt
lake
city
and
made
a
series
of
close
observations
i
began
an
hourly
set
of
barometrical
readings
and
as
soon
as
clem
came
back
he
helped
me
to
run
them
day
and
night
for
eight
consecutive
days
jack
meanwhile
was
preparing
for
a
trip
to
the
moki
towns
the
major
and
jones
had
gone
off
for
some
special
work
and
andy
started
with
a
waggon
for
beaver
to
bring
down
rations
occasional
bands
of
trading
navajos
enlivened
the
days
and
i
secured
five
good
blankets
in
exchange
for
old
yawger
who
was
now
about
useless
for
our
purposes
gave
him
to
me
to
get
what
i
could
for
him
and
he
also
gave
clem
another
derelict
for
the
same
purpose
on
the
of
october
jack
andy
and
clem
started
with
jacob
on
his
annual
trip
to
the
mokis
by
way
of
lee
lonely
dell
while
jones
went
north
to
long
valley
on
the
head
of
the
virgin
for
topography
the
major
on
foot
with
a
mormon
companion
and
a
pai
ute
explored
from
long
valley
down
the
narrow
canyon
of
the
virgin
to
shunesburg
about
miles
a
trip
never
before
made
the
canyon
is
about
two
thousand
feet
deep
and
in
places
only
twenty
or
thirty
feet
wide
twisting
in
such
a
way
that
the
sky
was
not
visible
at
times
and
the
stream
often
filled
it
from
side
to
side
so
that
they
had
to
swim
illustration
the
grand
canyon
at
the
bottom
near
foot
of
bass
trail
about
eleven
that
night
came
to
wake
me
up
to
say
that
a
telegram
had
arrived
stating
that
najavos
again
had
been
raiding
and
had
stolen
seventy
head
of
horses
from
parowan
they
were
supposed
to
be
making
for
el
vado
and
nobody
in
the
absence
of
jacob
seemed
to
know
just
what
to
do
about
it
had
advised
them
to
organise
a
party
and
cut
off
the
raiders
but
they
preferred
to
consult
jacob
before
doing
anything
now
asked
me
if
i
would
be
willing
to
ride
at
once
to
the
navajo
well
where
jacob
had
expected
to
camp
and
notify
him
of
the
raid
no
one
else
in
town
understanding
where
the
well
was
few
besides
ourselves
and
jacob
ever
having
travelled
that
way
i
said
i
would
go
if
i
could
have
one
companion
it
was
a
lonely
journey
and
besides
i
might
come
on
the
navajos
before
reaching
the
well
charley
riggs
a
splendid
fellow
whom
i
liked
exceedingly
volunteered
filling
our
overcoat
pockets
with
cartridges
and
each
with
a
good
winchester
across
his
saddle
we
started
about
under
a
fine
moon
and
a
clear
sky
i
knew
the
way
perfectly
even
by
moonlight
we
took
no
wrong
turns
had
no
stops
and
made
excellent
time
toward
the
navajo
well
twenty
miles
away
on
we
went
over
the
open
country
skirting
the
vermilion
cliffs
on
our
left
neck
by
neck
stride
by
stride
never
changing
our
place
but
not
at
the
headlong
gallop
by
which
they
brought
the
news
over
a
road
to
aix
we
rode
steadily
as
fast
as
the
ground
would
permit
sometimes
on
a
gallop
sometimes
on
a
trot
about
two
as
we
neared
a
canyon
where
an
old
trail
came
down
from
the
north
which
the
raiders
might
follow
we
slowed
up
and
advanced
with
caution
dimly
we
perceived
what
appeared
to
be
a
number
of
sleeping
forms
under
the
ordinary
navajo
and
white
striped
service
blanket
throwing
our
guns
up
ready
for
action
we
rode
ahead
slowly
to
pass
by
a
detour
if
not
discovered
we
then
saw
that
the
objects
were
nothing
but
peculiar
bushes
with
a
feeling
of
sympathy
for
the
dear
knight
of
la
mancha
and
his
worthy
sancho
we
spurred
forward
at
four
by
the
watch
dawn
began
to
spread
on
the
sky
and
we
rode
into
the
camp
at
the
navajo
well
a
shout
and
our
hoofbeats
had
roused
the
sleepers
i
delivered
my
message
to
jacob
who
immediately
started
for
el
vado
with
charley
riggs
intending
to
add
several
more
men
to
his
band
at
the
paria
settlement
which
he
would
pass
through
a
route
he
had
often
before
followed
for
a
like
purpose
my
leg
was
by
no
means
well
and
it
would
have
been
imprudent
on
this
account
for
me
to
further
lend
my
services
i
let
jacob
have
my
rifle
and
ammunition
and
returned
to
kanab
jack
andy
and
clem
going
on
to
lee
to
wait
i
reached
the
settlement
before
noon
when
george
adair
and
tom
stewart
started
heavily
armed
to
join
jacob
at
the
earliest
moment
a
pai
ute
later
came
in
with
a
report
that
a
fresh
party
of
navajos
on
a
trading
trip
had
recently
come
across
the
colorado
and
from
this
we
concluded
that
the
alarm
was
false
or
that
the
culprits
were
utes
who
went
off
into
the
dirty
devil
country
with
adams
went
out
towards
the
paria
and
then
to
the
kaibab
to
do
some
topographic
work
along
the
north
rim
of
the
grand
canyon
and
i
was
left
without
any
of
our
party
in
the
village
it
being
deemed
inadvisable
for
me
to
do
much
riding
or
walking
till
my
wound
which
was
now
doing
well
had
more
nearly
healed
i
devoted
my
time
to
plotting
up
notes
finishing
sketches
drawings
of
pictographs
and
took
my
meals
at
sister
louisa
i
became
much
interested
in
the
story
of
her
experiences
which
she
told
us
from
time
to
time
especially
as
she
was
one
of
the
women
who
had
pushed
a
handcart
across
the
plains
after
a
few
days
the
major
came
in
from
a
trip
accompanied
by
several
pai
utes
among
whom
was
chuarooumpeak
the
young
chief
of
the
kaibab
band
usually
called
frank
by
the
settlers
and
chuar
by
his
own
people
the
pai
utes
having
no
f
in
their
language
pronounced
his
english
name
brank
just
as
they
called
me
bred
their
usual
name
for
me
was
untokarowits
derived
from
the
dark
red
colour
of
my
hair
frank
was
a
remarkably
good
man
he
had
been
constantly
devoted
to
the
safety
and
welfare
of
the
whites
a
most
fluent
speaker
in
his
native
tongue
he
would
address
his
people
with
long
flights
of
uninterrupted
rhetorical
skill
old
patnish
came
in
occasionally
though
he
did
not
look
particularly
dangerous
his
eye
was
keen
and
his
bearing
positive
nobody
would
have
interfered
with
him
unless
prepared
for
a
fight
to
the
finish
one
day
i
rode
to
johnson
by
the
trail
and
learned
when
i
got
back
that
patnish
had
arrived
at
kanab
by
the
road
so
i
just
missed
an
interview
the
term
old
patnish
signifies
that
scoundrel
patnish
but
when
the
people
spoke
of
old
jacob
the
prefix
was
one
of
respect
and
affection
so
contrary
is
the
meaning
that
can
be
put
into
three
letters
charley
riggs
and
george
adair
came
back
from
el
vado
saying
that
no
raiding
navajos
had
been
seen
so
our
opinion
of
the
false
alarm
was
confirmed
illustration
showing
results
of
recent
of
part
of
the
grand
canyon

bright
angel

the
geological
survey
with
ample
time
for
detail

c
at
page
the
south
end
of
kaibab
plateau
on
the
of
october
we
had
the
first
snow
of
the
season
which
lasted
only
a
few
hours
snow
never
being
heavy
at
kanab
the
major
had
planned
another
journey
to
the
uinkaret
region
and
we
started
november
taking
with
us
three
of
the
kaibab
band
chuar
another
called
george
or
as
they
pronounced
it
judge
and
waytoots
the
major
desiring
to
talk
to
them
in
our
camps
to
continue
his
vocabulary
and
the
collection
of
other
linguistic
material
which
he
had
been
gathering
from
them
and
others
in
and
around
kanab
at
every
opportunity
our
party
proceeded
to
pipe
spring
camping
half
a
mile
below
the
houses
and
striking
the
next
day
monday
november
for
the
wild
band
pocket
finding
no
water
there
the
natives
led
on
toward
a
spring
they
knew
of
in
a
low
line
of
cliffs
i
was
riding
a
broncho
broken
only
a
few
weeks
before
and
at
an
unexpected
moment
i
was
suddenly
deemed
non
but
i
kept
my
seat
and
vanquished
the
beast
after
a
vigorous
circus
meeting
thereafter
with
no
further
opposition
we
saw
a
band
of
twenty
wild
horses
spinning
across
the
plain
one
behind
another
like
a
train
of
railway
cars
a
huge
stallion
playing
locomotive
perhaps
my
broncho
felt
the
call
of
the
band
darkness
dropped
down
on
us
before
we
could
get
to
the
spring
we
had
to
make
a
camp
that
was
not
exactly
dry
though
there
was
no
drinking
water
for
a
drizzling
rain
half
snow
set
in
the
snow
serving
to
hold
the
accompanying
rain
on
the
surface
we
were
wading
in
slush
and
it
was
a
task
to
find
a
decent
place
for
blankets
jones
and
i
bunked
together
his
side
of
the
bed
was
a
slight
hollow
in
consequence
of
which
the
melting
slush
formed
under
him
a
chilly
pool
that
interfered
seriously
with
his
slumbers
i
happened
to
be
lying
on
a
lump
or
ridge
and
kept
fairly
dry
by
never
stirring
the
whole
night
the
rain
ceased
by
morning
and
all
day
tuesday
we
travelled
toward
the
uinkaret
mountains
over
a
comparatively
level
desert
but
not
going
rapidly
as
we
had
a
waggon
the
ground
having
been
softened
by
the
rain
the
wheels
cut
deeply
there
being
of
course
no
road
a
flock
of
antelope
blew
by
we
did
not
give
them
a
second
glance
as
they
were
too
far
off
to
be
hunted
it
was
after
dark
when
we
arrived
at
the
rocky
pool
where
we
had
before
camped
in
march
which
we
learned
now
from
chuar
the
natives
called
the
innupin
or
oonupin
picavu
or
witch
they
said
the
locality
was
a
favourite
haunt
of
witches
these
were
often
troublesome
and
had
to
be
driven
away
or
they
might
hurt
one
there
was
plenty
of
wood
and
we
were
soon
comfortable
with
a
keen
november
wind
to
emphasise
our
blessings
the
water
in
the
pocket
was
clear
and
pure
but
it
was
full
of
small
wigglers
we
tried
to
dip
up
a
pail
which
should
be
free
from
them
the
major
seeing
our
efforts
took
a
cup
and
without
looking
drank
it
down
with
the
nonchalant
remark
i
have
seen
any
wigglers
the
pai
utes
had
killed
some
rabbits
which
they
now
skinned
and
cooked
i
say
cooked
but
perhaps
i
should
say
warmed
dexterously
stripping
off
the
skins
they
slit
open
the
abdomen
removed
the
entrails
and
after
squeezing
out
the
contents
by
drawing
between
thumb
and
fingers
they
replaced
the
interminable
string
in
the
cavity
closing
the
aperture
with
the
ears
and
stowed
the
carcass
in
the
hot
ashes
for
a
few
minutes
then
they
ate
the
whole
thing
with
complete
satisfaction
we
preferred
to
fry
ours
without
the
entrails
in
a
pan
with
bacon
fat
frequently
the
major
gave
me
little
talks
on
science
as
he
was
much
interested
in
my
future
career
and
by
the
fire
this
evening
he
instructed
me
in
some
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
natural
philosophy
chuar
having
had
one
of
his
men
remove
his
shoes
which
were
heavy
mericats
ones
was
reclining
in
a
princely
way
smoking
a
cigarette
on
a
bank
near
the
fire
suddenly
he
rose
to
his
feet
intently
listening
and
peering
anxiously
out
through
the
enveloping
gloom
of
the
piñons
and
cedars
i
asked
him
what
he
heard
oonupits
he
whispered
solemnly
never
ceasing
his
watchful
gaze
then
cautiously
aiming
his
long
rifle
in
the
direction
he
fired
a
shot
and
seemed
satisfied
that
the
intruder
was
driven
away
or
destroyed
he
described
the
noise
of
the
oonupits
as
a
whistling
sound
he
and
his
men
had
a
habit
of
waking
in
the
night
in
our
various
camps
and
singing
first
one
beginning
very
low
the
others
joining
in
one
by
one
and
increasing
the
power
as
they
did
so
till
all
were
singing
in
full
voice
this
woke
us
up
we
threw
things
at
them
but
with
no
effect
what
do
you
do
it
for
said
i
to
chuar
to
drive
away
the
oonupits
he
answered
in
the
morning
november
the
major
and
i
went
off
reconnoitring
and
did
not
get
back
to
camp
till
after
dark
when
we
found
there
a
short
fat
uinkaret
whom
chuar
introduced
as
teemaroomtekai
chief
in
the
settlements
when
he
ventured
to
go
there
he
was
known
as
watermelon
according
to
frank
hamblin
who
was
with
us
teemaroomtekai
had
a
companion
and
next
day
and
the
major
climbed
mt
trumbull
with
them
wishing
to
have
a
talk
with
the
shewits
we
moved
on
the
around
to
oak
spring
near
which
some
of
them
were
encamped
with
their
kinsmen
the
uinkarets
i
was
interested
to
see
what
the
slayers
of
the
howlands
and
dunn
looked
like
except
for
a
wilder
more
defiant
aspect
they
differed
little
from
other
pai
utes
their
country
being
so
isolated
and
unvisited
they
were
surly
and
independent
the
uinkarets
on
the
other
hand
were
rather
genial
more
like
the
kaivavit
band
the
major
traded
for
bags
of
food
seeds
baskets
spoons
made
from
mountain
sheep
horns
balls
of
compressed
cactus
fruit
from
which
the
juice
had
been
extracted
for
a
kind
of
wine
rolls
of
pulp
which
they
ate
like
bread
all
for
the
smithsonian
institution
with
the
shewits
the
major
and
had
a
conference
wished
to
make
a
reconnaissance
through
their
region
and
explained
to
them
what
he
wanted
to
do
an
agreement
was
reached
by
which
he
was
to
be
permitted
without
molestation
of
any
kind
to
go
anywhere
and
everywhere
with
two
shewits
for
guides
and
one
of
our
party
as
cook
and
helper
in
order
that
he
could
tell
washington
about
the
country
the
helper
however
was
to
stick
to
the
trail
and
remain
in
camp
so
that
he
would
know
as
little
as
possible
and
should
not
tell
that
little
to
the
mormoni
whom
the
shewits
disliked
nathan
adams
a
mormon
was
the
man
to
accompany
and
he
did
not
enjoy
the
prospect
at
all
on
monday
november
the
major
and
jones
climbed
mount
logan
for
more
data
and
took
a
general
survey
of
the
country
while
i
went
out
on
foot
climbed
measured
and
located
eight
large
when
they
came
down
the
major
said
he
had
seen
a
fine
isolated
mountain
to
the
west
which
he
had
called
after
me
and
i
naturally
felt
much
pleased
with
the
honour
of
having
my
name
stamped
on
the
map
the
next
day
november
our
party
divided
into
three
frank
hamblin
went
out
to
george
with
the
waggon
after
rations
with
nathan
adams
one
shewits
named
paantung
and
our
guide
judge
who
may
have
been
a
shewits
also
for
all
we
could
tell
prepared
for
the
entrance
into
shewits
land
while
the
major
jones
and
i
proceeded
to
the
foot
of
the
toroweap
to
a
near
the
edge
of
the
grand
canyon
called
by
the
uinkarets
teram
picavu
chuar
and
waytoots
went
back
to
kanab
and
we
hired
uinkarets
to
carry
our
goods
nine
miles
down
to
the
pocket
descending
feet
at
one
point
over
rough
lava
after
some
work
at
the
canyon
we
went
back
to
the
spring
on
the
the
uinkarets
again
acting
as
our
we
had
no
salt
left
by
this
time
and
very
little
food
but
we
killed
some
rabbits
and
cooked
them
on
hot
coals
the
adhering
ashes
making
a
substitute
for
salt
i
reached
the
spring
first
and
found
little
round
beaming
teemaroomtekai
who
knew
our
plans
already
there
with
a
great
big
mericats
fire
to
welcome
us
as
well
as
a
large
pile
of
wood
for
feeding
it
the
major
got
in
soon
after
but
jones
failed
to
come
at
all
which
worried
us
before
we
could
go
in
search
of
him
in
the
morning
he
arrived
his
horse
had
given
out
compelling
him
to
stay
where
he
was
all
night
we
had
travelled
hard
up
and
down
all
kinds
of
hills
canyons
and
mountains
with
seldom
a
trail
and
it
was
wearing
on
the
animals
living
only
on
bunch
grass

hillers
i
continued
measuring
and
locating
the
oonagaritchets
or
of
which
there
were
more
than
sixty
and
got
in
four
more
on
the
then
the
major
decided
to
move
to
another
the
uinkarets
told
about
farther
east
across
the
lava
a
pocket
they
called
tiravu
picavu
or
it
was
on
the
edge
of
the
basaltic
table
overlooking
what
they
termed
the
wonsits
tiravu
or
antelope
plain
they
said
there
was
no
water
now
but
as
one
declared
there
was
a
little
we
decided
to
go
while
the
major
followed
a
leading
to
or
from
george
wishing
to
make
some
special
observations
along
it
and
expecting
to
meet
and
stop
frank
with
the
waggon
now
due
jones
and
i
struck
across
on
the
moccasin
trail
leaving
our
goods
to
be
brought
on
by
the
uinkaret
packers
at
sunset
we
rounded
a
clump
of
studding
a
black
barren
waste
far
away
across
the
wonsits
tiravu
rose
the
red
cliff
land
up
and
up
to
the
eastern
sky
behind
was
the
great
bulk
of
trumbull
together
with
scores
of
the
smooth
verdureless
heaps
of
volcanic
cinders
everywhere
near
was
the
desert
of
basalt
with
nothing
but
the
faint
trail
to
point
the
way
and
the
night
slowly
enwrapping
us
on
we
urged
our
stumbling
weary
beasts
their
iron
clinking
on
the
metallic
rocks
on
till
the
thick
blackness
circled
us
like
a
wall
then
we
halted
and
built
a
little
brush
fire
thinking
to
stay
till
dawn
at
the
instant
a
weird
cry
from
far
back
fell
leaden
on
the
strangely
heavy
winter
air
our
packers
saw
where
we
were
and
presently
came
to
us
they
were
in
a
rage
pitching
along
in
the
dark
under
their
heavy
loads
they
were
cold
tired
famished
for
the
way
had
been
long
the
packs
heavy
frost
was
in
the
wind
they
now
pretended
not
to
know
where
the
end
was
i
thought
this
was
to
see
what
we
would
say
or
do
we
did
not
care
we
said
and
did
nothing
with
all
the
nonchalance
born
of
the
feeling
that
the
further
we
went
the
worse
it
was
then
one
remembered
the
pocket
was
near
and
he
struck
out
for
it
the
rest
following
as
best
we
could
through
the
thick
night
the
guide
occasionally
lighting
a
torch
of
grass
after
a
quarter
of
a
mile
he
stopped
in
the
bottom
of
a
deep
basaltic
gulch
here
was
the
place
the
uinkarets
threw
down
their
loads
and
squatted
glum
and
silent
from
the
hill
jones
and
i
scraped
together
an
armful
of
brush
and
got
a
small
fire
started
in
the
bottom
of
the
desolate
hollow
at
the
upper
end
of
it
on
a
sort
of
bench
eight
feet
wide
was
a
depression
covered
with
ice
three
or
four
inches
thick
with
some
difficulty
pounding
a
hole
through
this
we
found
beneath
a
small
amount
of
thick
slimy
water
full
of
green
scum
we
drank
some
the
uinkarets
drank
some
but
we
could
not
see
well
enough
to
get
any
out
for
the
animals
we
tied
them
to
rocks
to
prevent
them
from
leaving
in
the
night
the
indians
thawed
a
little
under
the
influence
of
the
fire
but
they
would
barely
speak
when
spoken
to
they
skinned
a
wildcat
they
had
killed
on
the
way
and
boiled
the
red
meat
briefly
in
our
kettle
and
ate
it
like
hungry
wolves
while
jones
and
i
all
the
time
wondering
what
had
become
of
the
major
made
a
light
lunch
on
some
of
our
scanty
supply
then
we
climbed
the
hill
and
getting
together
a
little
more
brush
jones
sat
keeping
a
signal
fire
going
as
long
as
he
had
fuel
but
the
wind
was
keen
and
strong
wood
limited
and
he
gave
it
up
spreading
our
blankets
we
went
to
sleep
morning
came
clear
and
sharp
i
took
my
glasses
and
went
up
to
scan
the
country
for
some
sign
of
the
major
or
our
waggon
and
i
rejoiced
to
discover
him
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
he
had
headed
for
the
fire
and
losing
it
kept
on
by
a
star
till
he
thought
he
was
near
us
when
he
made
a
small
fire
of
his
own
tied
his
mule
and
waited
for
day
we
had
a
bite
together
and
thawed
out
some
of
the
ice
in
our
kettle
providing
a
diminutive
drink
for
each
horse
then
leaving
the
natives
in
charge
of
the
baggage
we
rode
down
into
the
plain
to
find
our
waggon
taking
along
our
last
bit
of
bread
for
lunch
in
about
ten
miles
we
came
to
it
and
frank
hamblin
gave
us
the
latest
news
grant
elected
and
boston
burned
after
a
lunch
we
turned
back
making
a
camp
at
the
foot
of
the
basalt
thawing
out
more
ice
for
the
animals
and
giving
the
indians
some
food
about
two
the
major
and
i
rode
over
to
the
innupin
picavu
while
jones
and
the
waggon
went
around
as
it
could
not
cross
the
basalt
we
arrived
at
seven
while
the
waggon
did
not
come
till
half
past
eleven
when
we
prepared
a
good
supper
for
all
hands
turning
in
about
three
in
the
morning
not
a
man
awoke
before
ten
though
the
strong
sun
fell
on
our
faces
the
animals
were
used
up
and
we
did
what
we
could
on
foot
that
day
i
climbed
four
more
reaching
camp
at
dark
every
day
i
climbed
several
of
the
cones
but
some
were
so
far
away
that
i
had
to
make
a
special
camp
from
which
to
operate
the
waggon
was
loaded
with
ice
from
the
and
a
supply
of
provisions
and
driven
about
seven
miles
to
a
basaltic
gulch
in
a
locality
on
the
edge
of
a
treeless
valley
where
the
load
was
dropped
and
i
was
left
with
my
horse
before
dark
i
gathered
a
lot
of
wood
made
a
good
fire
and
melted
some
of
the
ice
that
formed
my
water
supply
in
a
brass
kettle
watering
my
horse
which
i
then
tethered
with
a
long
rope
where
there
was
good
grass
i
did
not
intend
to
waste
time
hunting
my
mount
in
the
morning
after
supper
i
spread
my
blankets
near
the
fire
and
by
the
light
of
a
bright
piñon
blaze
i
began
to
read
a
paper
edition
with
the
last
leaves
gone
having
gotten
into
camp
as
i
read
pip
interview
in
the
twilight
with
the
convict
on
the
dreary
marshes
i
was
in
deep
sympathy
with
the
desperate
hunger
of
the
terrible
man
and
when
joe
buttered
the
end
of
the
loaf
and
carved
off
the
slices
i
myself
was
hungry
enough
to
cook
supper
over
again
butter
had
now
been
absent
from
my
bill
of
fare
with
a
few
exceptions
for
nearly
two
years
i
was
careful
to
place
my
fire
where
it
would
be
well
screened
and
not
easily
seen
from
a
distance
i
did
not
care
to
have
any
shewits
or
even
uinkarets
visit
me
and
i
hoped
they
were
all
in
their
own
camps
though
i
sometimes
had
a
feeling
that
one
might
be
watching
from
the
shadows
of
the
great
basaltic
rocks
this
of
course
was
due
to
the
circumstances
and
not
to
any
probability
though
i
kept
my
winchester
near
my
hand
when
i
again
got
back
to
the
main
camp
the
major
told
me
that
the
first
night
of
my
absence
several
of
the
natives
came
in
and
not
seeing
me
around
inquired
my
whereabouts
he
gave
them
an
evasive
answer
believing
that
it
was
quite
as
well
not
to
apprise
them
of
the
situation
the
following
day
thursday
november
i
covered
a
wide
territory
climbing
five
a
great
distance
apart
and
each
quite
high
several
times
i
crossed
recent
moccasin
tracks
but
met
no
natives
and
at
nightfall
i
was
still
a
long
way
from
my
camp
when
the
darkness
became
so
dense
that
i
could
not
see
even
faint
outlines
i
took
a
star
for
guidance
till
clouds
blotted
it
out
then
i
was
completely
adrift
in
a
sea
of
mountains
i
could
not
tell
one
direction
from
another
throwing
the
reins
on
the
broncho
neck
i
sat
back
in
my
saddle
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
slowly
cautiously
the
animal
plodded
over
broken
rocky
ground
succeeded
by
smoother
footing
as
i
could
tell
by
the
motion
and
in
about
an
hour
suddenly
and
quietly
halted
i
perceived
that
i
was
in
the
midst
of
cedars
a
light
spot
appeared
almost
beneath
dismounting
i
dropped
to
my
hands
and
knees
and
found
that
it
was
the
ashes
of
my
fire
the
broncho
the
same
that
had
tried
to
buck
me
off
a
few
days
before
had
come
back
to
the
camp
of
a
single
night
about
the
best
example
of
horse
sense
that
i
ever
experienced
after
another
comfortable
evening
with
dickens
i
was
prepared
to
go
on
with
my
special
task
and
finished
it
in
this
place
by
climbing
the
group
of
cones
near
the
tiravu
picavu
the
next
day
about
two
in
the
afternoon
i
got
back
to
my
camp
with
a
very
tired
mount
but
i
loaded
all
my
traps
on
my
saddle
the
ice
being
almost
exhausted
and
started
to
find
a
new
locality
where
i
was
to
meet
the
major
my
pack
was
high
my
broncho
tired
while
crossing
a
small
open
valley
near
sunset
the
poor
beast
suddenly
lay
down
with
me
there
being
no
water
anywhere
in
that
locality
i
was
forced
to
use
some
brutality
to
get
the
animal
up
without
further
incident
i
came
to
the
place
agreed
on
and
found
the
major
there
in
advance
we
camped
at
the
spot
and
the
next
day
saturday
november
i
climbed
five
more
cones
reaching
the
camp
at
sunset
sunday
the
major
went
on
with
his
particular
task
while
i
added
six
more
of
the
cones
to
my
list
getting
back
to
the
side
camp
late
in
the
day
the
major
was
to
go
in
by
himself
when
he
was
ready
so
i
took
all
the
outfit
on
my
horse
again
reached
the
oak
spring
trail
at
sunset
and
the
main
camp
two
hours
after
dark
glad
enough
to
drop
the
load
of
pails
bags
blankets
in
which
my
broncho
sympathised
more
deeply
than
could
be
expressed
illustration
the
grand
canyon
storm
effect
from
south
rim
monday
morning
november
we
turned
our
faces
toward
kanab
and
i
climbed
four
more
cones
on
the
way
out
overtaking
the
waggon
about
an
hour
after
dark
the
night
was
very
cold
and
i
was
ready
to
enjoy
the
warmth
of
a
fire
by
the
time
i
reached
the
camp
in
the
morning
we
had
a
visit
from
lieutenant
dinwiddie
of
lieut
wheeler
survey
i
rode
over
to
the
region
again
and
climbed
the
remaining
ones
seven
or
eight
reaching
camp
after
dark
the
days
being
very
short
at
this
time
of
year
the
camp
had
been
moved
nearer
to
the
spring
in
the
low
line
of
cliffs
where
we
had
halted
coming
out
and
the
major
with
his
usual
original
ideas
had
caused
the
waggon
to
be
lowered
by
ropes
into
a
deep
gulch
he
had
estimated
that
it
was
possible
to
go
out
through
the
cliffs
that
way
instead
of
going
all
the
way
around
his
geological
knowledge
did
not
lead
him
astray
there
was
no
trouble
whatever
in
taking
the
waggon
up
the
gulch
and
when
we
emerged
we
were
many
miles
on
the
road
to
pipe
spring
where
the
major
and
i
arrived
in
advance
of
the
others
we
had
dinner
and
he
then
went
on
alone
to
kanab
where
the
whole
party
arrived
the
next
day
thanksgiving
day
had
come
in
on
the
by
way
of
george
having
had
a
successful
tour
through
the
shewits
region
all
agreements
on
both
sides
having
been
carried
out
to
the
letter
he
had
been
two
weeks
in
the
wild
country
and
adams
declared
that
to
him
the
time
was
years
his
only
comfort
being
that
he
was
wearing
his
endowment
garment
a
sure
protection
from
all
evil
had
climbed
mount
dellenbaugh
though
the
shewits
objected
to
going
up
and
he
remained
on
the
trail
it
was
found
to
be
a
basaltic
peak
feet
above
but
only
or
above
its
base
on
the
summit
were
the
ruins
of
a
shinumo
building
circular
in
shape
twenty
feet
in
diameter
with
walls
remaining
about
two
feet
high
it
was
not
far
from
the
base
of
this
mountain
that
the
howlands
and
dunn
were
killed
paantung
guide
saying
it
was
done
by
some
no
sense
shewits
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
guide
had
been
of
the
party
himself
all
was
preparation
in
our
camp
for
the
departure
of
the
major
for
salt
lake
and
washington
i
had
expected
to
go
east
at
this
time
also
but
both
the
major
and
being
desirous
of
having
me
remain
a
while
longer
to
help
finish
up
the
preliminary
map
i
agreed
to
do
so
and
on
the
of
november
all
the
original
party
set
out
but
thompson
and
myself
a
new
member
john
renshawe
had
arrived
a
few
days
before
to
assist
at
the
topography
when
the
party
had
been
gone
some
time
it
was
discovered
that
they
had
forgotten
several
things
i
took
a
horse
and
rode
over
with
the
articles
to
the
camp
they
intended
to
make
at
johnson
where
i
remained
till
morning
the
major
was
so
eager
to
get
an
early
start
that
he
had
all
hands
up
long
before
sunrise
when
breakfast
was
eaten
we
had
to
sit
by
the
fire
three
quarters
of
an
hour
before
there
was
light
enough
for
the
men
to
trail
the
horses
then
i
said
they
went
on
and
i
went
back
jones
and
andy
i
never
saw
again
concluded
to
make
winter
headquarters
in
kanab
and
a
lot
was
rented
for
the
purpose
on
december
we
put
up
a
large
tent
in
one
corner
with
two
small
ones
for
rations
and
saddles
the
next
day
we
put
up
one
in
the
other
corner
for
and
thompson
and
at
the
back
of
the
lot
we
arranged
a
corral
for
the
horses
or
mules
we
might
want
to
catch
the
large
tents
were
floored
with
pine
boards
and
along
the
sides
heavy
cedar
boughs
were
placed
in
crotches
around
which
the
guy
ropes
were
passed
before
staking
the
tents
thus
were
dry
inside
and
could
not
blow
down
a
conical
iron
stove
on
a
boxing
of
earth
heated
the
large
tent
like
a
furnace
in
the
middle
of
the
general
tent
we
placed
a
long
and
were
ready
for
work
another
tent
half
boards
was
erected
near
ours
for
kitchen
and
and
riley
who
had
turned
up
again
hired
as
cook
and
master
of
this
structure
riley
who
had
spent
his
whole
life
in
camp
and
saddle
was
the
best
frontier
or
camp
cook
i
ever
saw
scrupulously
clean
to
the
last
detail
of
his
pots
and
pans
he
knew
how
to
make
to
perfection
all
manner
of
eatables
possible
under
the
circumstances
arranged
for
a
supply
of
potatoes
butter
meats
and
everything
within
reason
so
we
lived
very
well
with
an
occasional
dash
of
dixie
wine
to
add
zest
while
on
christmas
day
riley
prepared
a
special
feast
though
the
sky
was
sombre
the
town
was
merry
and
there
was
a
dance
in
the
but
i
did
not
attend
rainy
weather
set
in
on
the
and
the
old
year
welcomed
the
new
in
a
steady
downpour
making
january
rather
a
dismal
holiday
even
the
mail
which
arrived
this
day
was
soaked
toward
evening
the
skies
lifted
somewhat
and
a
waggon
appeared
or
rather
two
mules
and
two
horses
on
a
common
freighting
waggon
in
which
lyman
hamblin
and
two
others
were
playing
as
nearly
in
unison
as
possible
a
fiddle
a
drum
and
a
fife
while
we
were
admiring
this
feat
we
heard
hearty
shout
and
saw
our
waggon
returning
under
his
charge
from
salt
lake
with
supplies
with
a
cook
stove
for
our
kitchen
and
with
a
new
suit
of
clothes
for
me
accompanied
by
the
compliments
of
and
the
major
our
camp
in
kanab
was
now
as
complete
and
comfortable
as
any
one
might
wish
and
our
work
of
preparing
the
map
went
forward
rapidly
as
soon
as
it
could
be
finished
i
was
to
take
it
to
salt
lake
and
send
it
by
express
to
the
major
in
washington
to
show
congress
what
we
had
been
doing
and
what
a
remarkable
region
it
was
that
we
had
been
investigating
in
the
evenings
we
visited
our
friends
in
the
settlement
or
they
visited
us
or
we
read
what
books
papers
and
magazines
we
could
get
hold
of
john
and
i
also
amused
ourselves
by
writing
down
all
the
songs
that
were
sung
around
camp
to
which
i
added
a
composition
of
my
own
to
the
tune
of
to
the
star
spangled
an
abandoned
rebel
one
these
words
ran
oh
boys
you
remember
the
wild
colorado
its
rapids
and
its
rocks
will
trouble
us
no
more
with
a
mention
in
the
various
stanzas
of
each
member
of
the
party
and
his
characteristics
the
horses
became
with
nothing
to
do
and
plenty
of
good
feed
one
of
our
amusements
was
to
corral
several
and
then
putting
saddles
on
the
most
prancing
specimens
mount
and
ride
down
on
the
plain
the
horse
running
at
top
speed
with
the
impression
that
he
was
full
master
of
the
situation
and
expecting
us
to
try
to
stop
him
instead
we
enjoyed
the
exhilaration
of
it
and
let
the
charger
alone
till
after
a
couple
of
miles
he
concluded
the
fun
was
all
on
our
side
and
took
a
more
moderate
gait
of
his
own
accord
there
were
several
horse
races
also
and
the
days
flew
by
on
february
i
finished
plotting
the
river
down
to
the
kanab
canyon
and
as
if
to
emphasise
this
point
a
set
in
by
the
the
snow
was
five
inches
deep
and
we
had
word
that
the
snow
on
the
divide
to
the
north
over
the
culmination
of
the
various
lines
of
cliffs
where
i
would
have
to
pass
to
go
to
salt
lake
was
very
heavy
on
the
the
mail
rider
failed
to
get
through
we
learned
also
that
an
epizoötic
had
come
to
utah
and
many
horses
were
laid
up
by
it
crippling
the
stage
lines
it
had
been
planned
that
i
should
go
north
with
our
own
horses
till
i
could
connect
with
some
stage
line
and
then
take
that
for
the
remainder
of
the
distance
to
the
utah
southern
railway
which
then
had
been
extended
south
from
salt
lake
as
far
as
lehi
on
the
of
february
which
was
sunday
i
put
the
last
touches
on
the
map
drawn
from
the
original
on
a
large
sheet
of
tracing
cloth
rolled
it
carefully
up
and
placed
it
in
a
long
tin
tube
we
had
ordered
from
the
local
tinsmith
this
i
carried
on
my
back
as
i
did
not
mean
to
be
separated
from
it
a
minute
till
i
gave
it
into
the
hands
of
wells
fargo
express
in
salt
lake
jack
was
to
go
with
me
saying
a
last
to
and
thompson
to
john
and
to
some
of
my
kanab
friends
who
came
to
see
the
start
we
left
a
little
after
noon
with
one
pack
on
a
broncho
mule
jack
riding
a
mule
and
i
a
favourite
horse
of
mine
called
by
the
unusual
name
of
billy
the
always
had
to
be
blindfolded
before
we
could
handle
him
and
if
the
blind
should
accidentally
slip
off
there
was
an
instantaneous
convulsion
which
had
a
most
disrupting
effect
going
straight
up
the
canyon
we
crossed
over
finally
into
long
valley
and
were
on
the
headwaters
of
the
virgin
at
sunset
we
came
to
a
little
settlement
called
mt
carmel
but
continued
to
glendale
where
we
arrived
about
seven
having
come
in
all
thirty
miles
at
the
bishop
house
we
were
welcomed
and
there
got
some
supper
putting
our
three
animals
in
his
corral
we
did
not
care
to
sleep
in
the
house
choosing
for
our
the
last
remains
of
a
haystack
where
we
spread
our
blankets
covering
the
whole
with
a
paulin
as
the
sky
looked
threatening
i
never
slept
more
comfortably
in
my
life
except
that
i
was
in
the
stillness
by
water
trickling
down
my
neck
we
pulled
the
canvas
clear
up
over
our
heads
and
were
troubled
no
more
when
we
awoke
in
the
morning
a
heaviness
on
top
of
us
we
knew
meant
snow
we
were
covered
by
a
full
foot
of
it
soft
and
dry
valley
mountain
everything
was
a
solid
expanse
of
white
the
only
dark
spot
being
our
red
blankets
as
we
threw
back
the
paulin
the
sky
was
grey
and
sullen
more
snow
was
in
the
air
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
eaten
we
slung
our
pack
saddled
and
rode
up
the
valley
following
as
well
as
we
could
the
directions
given
by
the
bishop
neither
jack
nor
i
had
been
this
way
before
we
could
see
the
slight
depression
in
the
surface
of
the
snow
which
indicated
a
beneath
and
by
that
token
continued
up
the
valley
the
slopes
sprinkled
by
large
pine
trees
snow
fell
thickly
it
was
not
always
easy
to
see
our
way
but
we
went
on
at
a
certain
point
we
were
to
turn
to
the
left
up
a
side
gulch
following
it
till
we
came
to
the
divide
some
eight
thousand
or
nine
thousand
feet
above
where
we
expected
to
go
down
to
the
head
of
the
sevier
valley
where
jack
had
before
been
by
another
route
at
the
gulch
we
deemed
the
correct
one
no
road
or
trail
being
visible
we
turned
late
in
the
afternoon
to
the
left
and
rapidly
mounted
higher
with
the
fresh
snow
growing
correspondingly
deeper
till
it
was
about
two
feet
on
the
level
the
going
was
slow
and
hard
the
sky
still
dropping
heavy
flakes
upon
us
about
five
we
found
ourselves
on
the
summit
of
a
high
bald
knob
topping
the
world
in
every
direction
through
the
similar
bald
knobs
could
be
seen
looming
against
the
darkening
sky
the
old
drifts
were
so
deep
that
where
a
horse
broke
through
the
crust
he
went
down
to
the
end
of
his
leg
this
excited
them
and
they
plunged
wildly
i
finally
got
them
all
three
still
and
quiet
while
jack
scanned
the
outlook
intently
see
any
landmark
jack
said
i
not
a
damned
thing
i
ever
saw
before
answered
jack
at
brief
intervals
the
falling
snow
would
cease
and
we
could
see
more
clearly
except
that
the
impending
night
began
to
cast
over
all
a
general
obscurity
there
was
a
deep
valley
beyond
to
the
right
while
it
was
not
possible
to
tell
directions
we
felt
that
our
course
must
lie
there
and
i
led
the
way
down
a
long
treeless
slope
breaking
a
path
as
well
as
i
could
my
horse
following
behind
the
others
urged
on
by
jack
from
the
rear
the
snow
became
shallower
near
the
bottom
we
mounted
and
i
rode
in
the
direction
that
jack
thought
we
ought
to
take
to
come
to
the
road
down
the
sevier
where
he
had
before
travelled
we
crossed
the
valley
in
doing
this
but
at
one
point
in
the
very
bottom
my
horse
wanted
to
turn
to
the
left
which
would
have
taken
us
down
the
deepening
valley
i
prevented
his
turning
and
we
continued
up
a
gulch
a
mile
or
two
where
it
narrowed
till
we
could
barely
proceed
jack
then
climbed
up
on
a
cliff
and
disappeared
endeavouring
to
see
some
familiar
object
the
falling
snow
having
at
last
stopped
i
stood
in
my
tracks
with
the
three
animals
and
waited
so
long
i
began
to
be
afraid
that
jack
had
met
with
an
accident
just
then
i
heard
him
descending
it
was
nearly
dark
he
could
not
see
any
sign
of
the
region
he
had
been
in
before
snow
and
darkness
puzzle
one
even
in
a
familiar
country
we
then
went
back
to
the
valley
where
the
horse
had
wished
to
turn
and
followed
it
down
now
believing
that
it
might
be
the
right
way
after
all
for
billy
had
been
over
the
road
several
times
another
example
of
horse
sense
which
seems
to
prove
that
horses
know
more
than
we
think
they
do
we
had
expected
to
reach
ranch
before
night
and
had
not
brought
an
axe
in
consequence
keeping
down
the
valley
till
we
came
to
a
group
of
cedars
some
of
which
were
dead
and
a
tall
pine
tree
we
camped
pulling
branches
from
the
cedars
and
bark
from
the
pine
for
a
fire
which
quickly
melted
its
way
down
to
the
ground
leaving
a
convenient
seat
all
round
about
twenty
inches
high
upon
which
we
laid
blankets
to
sit
on
our
pack
contained
enough
food
for
supper
breakfast
would
have
to
take
care
of
itself
we
also
had
some
grain
which
we
fed
to
the
hungry
animals
and
tied
them
under
the
cedars
where
they
were
protected
in
a
measure
from
the
sharp
wind
though
they
were
standing
in
deep
snow
for
ourselves
we
cut
twigs
from
the
green
cedars
and
made
a
thick
mattress
on
the
snow
with
them
our
blankets
on
top
of
these
made
a
bed
fit
for
a
king
the
storm
cleared
entirely
a
brilliant
moon
shone
over
all
causing
the
falling
frost
in
the
air
to
scintillate
like
diamonds
in
the
morning
tuesday
february
we
packed
up
at
once
having
nothing
left
to
eat
and
proceeded
down
the
valley
wondering
if
we
were
on
the
right
road
or
not
the
sky
arched
over
with
that
deep
tone
that
is
almost
black
in
winter
in
high
altitudes
and
the
sun
fell
in
a
dazzling
sheet
upon
the
wide
range
of
unbroken
white
the
surface
was
like
a
mirror
the
eyes
closed
against
the
intense
light
instinctively
as
we
went
on
northwards
and
downwards
a
faint
double
continuous
hollow
began
to
appear
on
the
snow
a
at
the
bottom
it
became
more
and
more
distinct
and
we
then
felt
sure
that
we
were
on
the
right
road
though
we
were
not
positive
till
near
noon
when
approaching
a
rocky
point
we
suddenly
heard
the
clear
ring
of
an
axe
on
the
metallic
air
a
few
moments
later
turning
this
we
saw
a
large
swift
stream
flowing
clear
between
snowy
banks
and
beyond
a
log
cabin
with
blue
smoke
rising
from
the
immense
stone
chimney
in
front
was
a
man
chopping
wood
his
dog
was
barking
it
was
a
welcome
a
beautiful
picture
of
frontier
comfort
it
was
asa
ranch
asa
was
one
of
the
men
who
helped
the
major
on
his
arrival
at
the
mouth
of
the
virgin
in
now
having
changed
his
residence
to
this
place
we
were
soon
made
welcome
in
the
single
large
room
of
the
cabin
where
all
the
family
were
and
while
the
horses
were
having
a
good
feed
an
equally
good
one
for
us
was
prepared
by
asa
on
the
fire
burning
snugly
in
the
great
chimney
never
did
fried
ham
boiled
eggs
and
hot
coffee
do
better
service
we
could
not
have
been
more
cordially
received
if
these
mormons
had
been
our
own
relatives
we
rested
there
till
about
three
when
we
bade
them
all
and
rode
on
down
the
valley
the
snow
continually
lessening
in
depth
till
when
we
reached
the
much
lower
altitude
of
panguitch
at
sunset
miles
from
our
night
camp
there
were
only
three
or
four
inches
and
the
temperature
was
not
nearly
so
low
though
still
very
cold
according
to
custom
we
applied
to
the
bishop
for
accomodation
for
ourselves
and
our
stock
and
were
again
cordially
received
we
were
quickly
made
comfortable
before
a
bright
fire
on
the
hearth
which
illumed
the
whole
room
while
the
good
wife
got
supper
the
bishop
an
exceedingly
pleasant
man
brought
out
some
dixie
wine
he
had
recently
received
he
poured
us
out
each
a
large
goblet
and
took
one
himself
after
a
hearty
supper
jack
and
i
put
down
our
blankets
on
the
haystack
and
knew
nothing
more
till
sunrise
leaving
panguitch
we
rode
on
down
the
sevier
crossing
it
frequently
and
made
about
forty
miles
passing
through
sevier
canyon
and
circle
valley
where
there
were
a
number
of
deserted
houses
and
arrived
for
night
at
the
ranch
of
a
gentile
named
van
buren
by
this
time
my
eyes
which
had
been
inflamed
by
the
strong
glare
of
the
sun
began
to
feel
as
if
they
were
full
of
sand
and
presently
i
became
aware
that
i
was
afflicted
with
that
painful
malady
snowblindness
i
could
barely
see
the
pain
in
both
eyes
was
extreme
and
a
river
of
tears
poured
forth
continually
other
men
whom
we
heard
of
as
we
went
on
were
blinded
worse
than
i
all
i
could
do
having
no
goggles
was
to
keep
my
hat
pulled
down
and
cut
off
the
glare
as
much
as
possible
at
marysvale
the
stage
had
been
abandoned
we
kept
on
finding
as
we
advanced
that
all
the
stages
were
put
out
of
business
by
the
epizoötic
there
was
nothing
for
jack
to
do
but
to
go
on
with
me
to
nephi
in
riding
through
one
village
i
saw
a
sign
on
the
closed
door
of
a
store
just
off
the
road
and
my
curiosity
led
me
to
ride
up
close
enough
to
read
it
i
did
not
linger
the
words
i
saw
were
small
pox
that
night
we
reached
nephi
under
the
shadow
of
the
superb
mount
nebo
where
i
tried
again
for
a
stage
so
that
jack
could
return
no
stage
arrived
and
the
following
morning
we
rode
on
northward
over
very
muddy
roads
finally
reaching
spanish
fork
where
a
fresh
covered
the
country
about
a
foot
making
travelling
still
more
difficult
another
day
journey
put
us
as
far
as
american
fork
only
three
miles
from
the
end
of
the
railway
a
place
called
lehi
for
which
we
made
a
very
early
start
the
next
day
wednesday
february
but
when
we
arrived
there
through
the
mud
and
slush
the
train
had
taken
its
departure
our
pack
mule
was
now
very
lame
and
travelled
with
difficulty
but
we
continued
on
toward
salt
lake
the
train
had
become
stalled
in
the
immense
snowdrifts
at
the
and
there
we
overtook
it
i
was
soon
on
board
with
my
tin
case
and
other
baggage
but
it
was
a
considerable
time
before
the
gang
of
men
and
a
snow
plough
extricated
the
train
about
five
we
ran
into
the
town
i
went
to
the
walker
house
then
the
best
hotel
and
that
night
slept
in
a
real
room
and
a
real
bed
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
two
years
but
i
opened
the
windows
as
wide
as
they
would
go
in
the
morning
i
sent
off
the
map
and
then
turned
my
attention
to
seeing
the
mormon
capital
cap
was
now
living
there
and
it
was
fennemore
home
i
also
found
bonnemort
and
macentee
in
town
and
jack
came
on
up
the
remaining
short
distance
in
order
to
take
a
fresh
start
for
kanab
nearly
forty
years
have
slipped
away
since
the
events
chronicled
in
this
volume
never
was
there
a
more
faithful
resolute

than
ours
