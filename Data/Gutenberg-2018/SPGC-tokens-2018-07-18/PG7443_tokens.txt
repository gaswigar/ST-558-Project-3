s
son
book
i
chapter
i
at
the
beginning
of
the
long
twilight
of
a
summer
evening
sam
mcpherson
a
tall
boy
of
thirteen
with
brown
hair
black
eyes
and
an
amusing
little
habit
of
tilting
his
chin
in
the
air
as
he
walked
came
upon
the
station
platform
of
the
little
town
of
caxton
in
iowa
it
was
a
board
platform
and
the
boy
walked
cautiously
lifting
his
bare
feet
and
putting
them
down
with
extreme
deliberateness
on
the
hot
dry
cracked
planks
under
one
arm
he
carried
a
bundle
of
newspapers
a
long
black
cigar
was
in
his
hand
in
front
of
the
station
he
stopped
and
jerry
donlin
the
seeing
the
cigar
in
his
hand
laughed
and
slowly
drew
the
side
of
his
face
up
into
a
laboured
wink
what
is
the
game
sam
he
asked
sam
stepped
to
the
door
handed
him
the
cigar
and
began
giving
directions
pointing
into
the
intent
and
in
the
face
of
the
irishman
s
laughter
then
turning
he
walked
across
the
station
platform
to
the
main
street
of
the
town
his
eyes
bent
on
the
ends
of
his
fingers
on
which
he
was
making
computations
with
his
thumb
jerry
looked
after
him
grinning
so
that
his
red
gums
made
a
splash
of
colour
on
his
bearded
face
a
gleam
of
paternal
pride
lit
his
eyes
and
he
shook
his
head
and
muttered
admiringly
then
lighting
the
cigar
he
went
down
the
platform
to
where
a
wrapped
bundle
of
newspapers
lay
against
the
building
under
the
window
of
the
telegraph
office
and
taking
it
in
his
arm
disappeared
still
grinning
into
the
sam
mcpherson
walked
down
main
street
past
the
shoe
store
the
bakery
and
the
candy
store
kept
by
penny
hughes
toward
a
group
lounging
at
the
front
of
geiger
s
drug
store
before
the
door
of
the
shoe
store
he
paused
a
moment
and
taking
a
small
from
his
pocket
ran
his
finger
down
the
pages
then
shaking
his
head
continued
on
his
way
again
absorbed
in
doing
sums
on
his
fingers
suddenly
from
among
the
men
by
the
drug
store
a
roaring
song
broke
the
evening
quiet
of
the
street
and
a
voice
huge
and
guttural
brought
a
smile
to
the
boy
s
lips
he
washed
the
windows
and
he
swept
the
floor
and
he
polished
up
the
handle
of
the
big
front
door
he
polished
that
handle
so
carefullee
that
now
he
s
the
ruler
of
the
queen
s
the
singer
a
short
man
with
grotesquely
wide
shoulders
wore
a
long
flowing
moustache
and
a
black
coat
covered
with
dust
that
reached
to
his
knees
he
held
a
smoking
briar
pipe
in
his
hand
and
with
it
beat
time
for
a
row
of
men
sitting
on
a
long
stone
under
the
store
window
and
pounding
on
the
sidewalk
with
their
heels
to
make
a
chorus
for
the
song
sam
s
smile
broadened
into
a
grin
as
he
looked
at
the
singer
freedom
smith
a
buyer
of
butter
and
eggs
and
past
him
at
john
telfer
the
orator
the
dandy
the
only
man
in
town
except
mike
mccarthy
who
kept
his
trousers
creased
among
all
the
men
of
caxton
sam
most
admired
john
telfer
and
in
his
admiration
had
struck
upon
the
town
s
high
light
telfer
loved
good
clothes
and
wore
them
with
an
air
and
never
allowed
caxton
to
see
him
shabbily
or
indifferently
dressed
laughingly
declaring
that
it
was
his
mission
in
life
to
give
tone
to
the
town
john
telfer
had
a
small
income
left
him
by
his
father
once
a
banker
in
the
town
and
in
his
youth
he
had
gone
to
new
york
to
study
art
and
later
to
paris
but
lacking
ability
or
industry
to
get
on
had
come
back
to
caxton
where
he
had
married
eleanor
millis
a
prosperous
milliner
they
were
the
most
successful
married
pair
in
caxton
and
after
years
of
life
together
they
were
still
in
love
were
never
indifferent
to
each
other
and
never
quarrelled
telfer
treated
his
wife
with
as
much
consideration
and
respect
as
though
she
were
a
sweetheart
or
a
guest
in
his
house
and
she
unlike
most
of
the
wives
in
caxton
never
ventured
to
question
his
goings
and
comings
but
left
him
free
to
live
his
own
life
in
his
own
way
while
she
attended
to
the
millinery
business
at
the
age
of
john
telfer
was
a
tall
slender
fine
looking
man
with
black
hair
and
a
little
black
pointed
beard
and
with
something
lazy
and
in
his
every
movement
and
impulse
dressed
in
white
flannels
with
white
shoes
a
jaunty
cap
upon
his
head
eyeglasses
hanging
from
a
gold
chain
and
a
cane
lightly
swinging
from
his
hand
he
made
a
figure
that
might
have
passed
unnoticed
on
the
promenade
before
some
fashionable
summer
hotel
but
that
seemed
a
breach
of
the
laws
of
nature
when
seen
on
the
streets
of
a
town
in
iowa
and
telfer
was
aware
of
the
extraordinary
figure
he
cut
it
was
a
part
of
his
programme
of
life
now
as
sam
approached
he
laid
a
hand
on
freedom
smith
s
shoulder
to
check
the
song
and
with
his
eyes
twinkling
with
began
thrusting
with
his
cane
at
the
boy
s
feet
he
will
never
be
ruler
of
the
queen
s
navee
he
declared
laughing
and
following
the
dancing
boy
about
in
a
wide
circle
he
is
a
little
mole
that
works
underground
intent
upon
worms
the
trick
he
has
of
tilting
up
his
nose
is
only
his
way
of
smelling
out
stray
pennies
i
have
it
from
banker
walker
that
he
brings
a
basket
of
them
into
the
bank
every
day
one
of
these
days
he
will
buy
the
town
and
put
it
into
his
vest
circling
about
on
the
stone
sidewalk
and
dancing
to
escape
the
flying
cane
sam
dodged
under
the
arm
of
valmore
a
huge
old
blacksmith
with
shaggy
clumps
of
hair
on
the
back
of
his
hands
and
sought
refuge
between
him
and
freedom
smith
the
blacksmith
s
hand
stole
out
and
lay
upon
the
boy
s
shoulder
telfer
his
legs
spread
apart
and
the
cane
hooked
upon
his
arm
began
rolling
a
cigarette
geiger
a
yellow
skinned
man
with
fat
cheeks
and
with
hands
clasped
over
his
round
paunch
smoked
a
black
cigar
and
as
he
sent
each
puff
into
the
air
grunted
forth
his
satisfaction
with
life
he
was
wishing
that
telfer
freedom
smith
and
valmore
instead
of
moving
on
to
their
nightly
nest
at
the
back
of
wildman
s
grocery
would
come
into
his
place
for
the
evening
he
thought
he
would
like
to
have
the
three
of
them
there
night
after
night
discussing
the
doings
of
the
world
quiet
once
more
settled
down
upon
the
sleepy
street
over
sam
s
shoulder
valmore
and
freedom
smith
talked
of
the
coming
corn
crop
and
the
growth
and
prosperity
of
the
country
times
are
getting
better
about
here
but
the
wild
things
are
almost
gone
said
freedom
who
in
the
winter
bought
hides
and
pelts
the
men
sitting
on
the
stone
beneath
the
window
watched
with
idle
interest
telfer
s
labours
with
paper
and
tobacco
young
henry
kerns
has
got
married
observed
one
of
them
striving
to
make
talk
he
has
married
a
girl
from
over
parkertown
way
she
gives
lessons
in
painting
china
painting
kind
of
an
artist
you
an
ejaculation
of
disgust
broke
from
telfer
his
fingers
trembled
and
the
tobacco
that
was
to
have
been
the
foundation
of
his
evening
smoke
rained
on
the
sidewalk
an
artist
he
exclaimed
his
voice
tense
with
excitement
who
said
artist
who
called
her
that
he
glared
fiercely
about
let
us
have
an
end
to
this
blatant
misuse
of
fine
old
words
to
say
of
one
that
he
is
an
artist
is
to
touch
the
peak
of
throwing
his
cigarette
paper
after
the
scattered
tobacco
he
thrust
one
hand
into
his
trouser
pocket
with
the
other
he
held
the
cane
emphasising
his
points
by
ringing
taps
upon
the
pavement
geiger
taking
the
cigar
between
his
fingers
listened
with
open
mouth
to
the
outburst
that
followed
valmore
and
freedom
smith
dropped
their
conversation
and
with
broad
smiles
upon
their
faces
gave
attention
and
sam
mcpherson
his
eyes
round
with
wonder
and
admiration
felt
again
the
thrill
that
always
ran
through
him
under
the
drum
beats
of
telfer
s
eloquence
an
artist
is
one
who
hungers
and
thirsts
after
perfection
not
one
who
dabs
flowers
upon
plates
to
choke
the
gullets
of
diners
declared
telfer
setting
himself
for
one
of
the
long
speeches
with
which
he
loved
to
astonish
the
men
of
caxton
and
glaring
down
at
those
seated
upon
the
stone
it
is
the
artist
who
among
all
men
has
the
divine
audacity
does
he
not
hurl
himself
into
a
battle
in
which
is
engaged
against
him
all
of
the
accumulative
genius
of
the
world
pausing
he
looked
about
for
an
opponent
upon
whom
he
might
pour
the
flood
of
his
eloquence
but
on
all
sides
smiles
greeted
him
undaunted
he
rushed
again
to
the
charge
a
business
man
what
is
he
he
demanded
he
succeeds
by
outwitting
the
little
minds
with
which
he
comes
in
contact
a
scientist
is
of
more
account
he
pits
his
brains
against
the
dull
unresponsiveness
of
inanimate
matter
and
a
hundredweight
of
black
iron
he
makes
do
the
work
of
a
hundred
housewives
but
an
artist
tests
his
brains
against
the
greatest
brains
of
all
times
he
stands
upon
the
peak
of
life
and
hurls
himself
against
the
world
a
girl
from
parkertown
who
paints
flowers
upon
dishes
to
be
called
an
artist
ugh
let
me
spew
forth
the
thought
let
me
cleanse
my
mouth
a
man
should
have
a
prayer
upon
his
lips
who
utters
the
word
artist
well
we
can
t
all
be
artists
and
the
woman
can
paint
flowers
upon
dishes
for
all
i
care
spoke
up
valmore
laughing
good
naturedly
we
can
t
all
paint
pictures
and
write
we
do
not
want
to
be
artists
we
do
not
dare
to
be
shouted
telfer
whirling
and
shaking
his
cane
at
valmore
you
have
a
misunderstanding
of
the
he
straightened
his
shoulders
and
threw
out
his
chest
and
the
boy
standing
beside
the
blacksmith
threw
up
his
chin
unconsciously
imitating
the
swagger
of
the
man
i
do
not
paint
pictures
i
do
not
write
books
yet
am
i
an
artist
declared
telfer
proudly
i
am
an
artist
practising
the
most
difficult
of
all
arts
the
art
of
living
here
in
this
western
village
i
stand
and
fling
my
challenge
to
the
world
on
the
lip
of
not
the
greatest
of
you
i
cry
has
life
been
more
he
turned
from
valmore
to
the
men
upon
the
stone
make
a
study
of
my
life
he
commanded
it
will
be
a
revelation
to
you
with
a
smile
i
greet
the
morning
i
swagger
in
the
noontime
and
in
the
evening
like
socrates
of
old
i
gather
a
little
group
of
you
benighted
villagers
about
me
and
toss
wisdom
into
your
teeth
striving
to
teach
you
judgment
in
the
use
of
great
you
talk
an
almighty
lot
about
yourself
john
grumbled
freedom
smith
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
the
subject
is
complex
it
is
varied
it
is
full
of
charm
telfer
answered
laughing
taking
a
fresh
supply
of
tobacco
and
paper
from
his
pocket
he
rolled
and
lighted
a
cigarette
his
fingers
no
longer
trembled
flourishing
his
cane
he
threw
back
his
head
and
blew
smoke
into
the
air
he
thought
that
in
spite
of
the
roar
of
laughter
that
had
greeted
freedom
smith
s
comment
he
had
vindicated
the
honour
of
art
and
the
thought
made
him
happy
to
the
newsboy
who
had
been
leaning
against
the
storefront
lost
in
admiration
it
seemed
that
he
had
caught
in
telfer
s
talk
an
echo
of
the
kind
of
talk
that
must
go
on
among
men
in
the
big
outside
world
had
not
this
telfer
travelled
far
had
he
not
lived
in
new
york
and
paris
without
understanding
the
sense
of
what
had
been
said
sam
felt
that
it
must
be
something
big
and
conclusive
when
from
the
distance
there
came
the
shriek
of
a
locomotive
he
stood
unmoved
trying
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
telfer
s
outburst
over
the
lounger
s
simple
statement
there
s
the
seven
cried
telfer
sharply
is
the
war
between
you
and
fatty
at
an
end

we
going
to
lose

springing
from

grasping

and
even
the
travelling

who
began
climbing
off

pulled
in

from

replace
his
regimentals
with
the
robes
of
a
judge
the
felt
hat
of
a
statesman
or
even
with
the
night
stick
of
a
village
marshal
life
might
have
retained
something
of
its
sweetness
but
to
have
ended
by
becoming
an
obscure
housepainter
in
a
village
that
lived
by
raising
corn
and
by
feeding
that
corn
to
red
steers
ugh
the
thought
made
him
shudder
he
looked
with
envy
at
the
blue
coat
and
the
brass
buttons
of
the
railroad
agent
he
tried
vainly
to
get
into
the
caxton
cornet
band
he
got
drunk
to
forget
his
humiliation
and
in
the
end
he
fell
to
loud
boasting
and
to
the
nursing
of
a
belief
within
himself
that
in
truth
not
lincoln
nor
grant
but
he
himself
had
thrown
the
winning
die
in
the
great
struggle
in
his
cups
he
said
as
much
and
the
caxton
corn
grower
punching
his
neighbour
in
the
ribs
shook
with
delight
over
the
statement
when
sam
was
a
twelve
year
old
barefooted
boy
upon
the
streets
a
kind
of
backwash
of
the
wave
of
glory
that
had
swept
over
windy
mcpherson
in
the
days
of
lapped
upon
the
shores
of
the
iowa
village
that
strange
manifestation
called
the
movement
brought
the
old
soldier
to
a
position
of
prominence
in
the
community
he
founded
a
local
branch
of
the
organisation
he
marched
at
the
head
of
a
procession
through
the
streets
he
stood
on
a
corner
and
pointing
a
trembling
forefinger
to
where
the
flag
on
the
schoolhouse
waved
beside
the
cross
of
rome
shouted
hoarsely
see
the
cross
rears
itself
above
the
flag
we
shall
end
by
being
murdered
in
our
beds
but
although
some
of
the
men
of
caxton
joined
the
movement
started
by
the
boasting
old
soldier
and
although
for
the
moment
they
vied
with
him
in
stealthy
creepings
through
the
streets
to
secret
meetings
and
in
mysterious
mutterings
behind
hands
the
movement
subsided
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
and
only
left
its
leader
more
desolate
in
the
little
house
at
the
end
of
the
street
by
the
shores
of
squirrel
creek
sam
and
his
sister
kate
regarded
their
father
s
warlike
pretensions
with
scorn
the
butter
is
low
father
s
army
leg
will
ache
they
whispered
to
each
other
across
the
kitchen
table
following
her
mother
s
example
kate
a
tall
slender
girl
of
sixteen
and
already
a
bread
winner
with
a
clerkship
in
winney
s
drygoods
store
remained
silent
under
windy
s
boasting
but
sam
striving
to
emulate
them
did
not
always
succeed
there
was
now
and
then
a
rebellious
muttering
that
should
have
warned
windy
it
had
once
burst
into
an
open
quarrel
in
which
the
victor
of
a
hundred
battles
withdrew
defeated
from
the
field
windy
had
taken
an
old
account
book
from
a
shelf
in
the
kitchen
a
relic
of
his
days
as
a
prosperous
merchant
when
he
had
first
come
to
caxton
and
had
begun
reading
to
the
little
family
a
list
of
names
of
men
who
he
claimed
had
been
the
cause
of
his
ruin
there
is
tom
newman
now
he
exclaimed
excitedly
owns
a
hundred
acres
of
good
land
and
won
t
pay
for
the
harness
on
the
backs
of
his
horses
or
for
the
ploughs
in
his
barn
the
receipt
he
has
from
me
is
forged
i
could
put
him
in
prison
if
i
chose
to
beat
an
old
soldier
to
beat
one
of
the
boys
of
it
is
shameful
i
have
heard
of
what
you
owed
and
what
men
owed
you
you
had
none
the
worst
of
it
sam
protested
coldly
while
kate
held
her
breath
and
jane
mcpherson
at
work
over
the
ironing
board
in
the
corner
half
turned
and
looked
silently
at
the
man
and
the
boy
the
slightly
increased
pallor
of
her
long
face
the
only
sign
that
she
had
heard
windy
had
not
pressed
the
quarrel
standing
for
a
moment
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
holding
the
book
in
his
hand
he
looked
from
the
pale
silent
mother
by
the
ironing
board
to
the
son
now
standing
and
staring
at
him
and
throwing
the
book
upon
the
table
with
a
bang
fled
the
house
you
don
t
understand
he
had
cried
you
don
t
understand
the
heart
of
a
in
a
way
the
man
was
right
the
two
children
did
not
understand
the
blustering
pretending
inefficient
old
man
having
moved
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
grim
silent
men
to
the
consummation
of
great
deeds
windy
could
not
get
the
flavour
of
those
days
out
of
his
outlook
upon
life
walking
half
drunk
in
the
darkness
along
the
sidewalks
of
caxton
on
the
evening
of
the
quarrel
the
man
became
inspired
he
threw
back
his
shoulders
and
walked
with
martial
tread
he
drew
an
imaginary
sword
from
its
scabbard
and
waved
it
aloft
stopping
he
aimed
carefully
at
a
body
of
imaginary
men
who
advanced
yelling
toward
him
across
a
wheatfield
he
felt
that
life
in
making
him
a
housepainter
in
a
farming
village
in
iowa
and
in
giving
him
an
unappreciative
son
had
been
cruelly
unfair
he
wept
at
the
injustice
of
it
the
american
civil
war
was
a
thing
so
passionate
so
inflaming
so
vast
so
absorbing
it
so
touched
to
the
quick
the
men
and
women
of
those
pregnant
days
that
but
a
faint
echo
of
it
has
been
able
to
penetrate
down
to
our
days
and
to
our
minds
no
real
sense
of
it
has
as
yet
crept
into
the
pages
of
a
printed
book
it
yet
wants
its
thomas
carlyle
and
in
the
end
we
are
put
to
the
need
of
listening
to
old
fellows
boasting
on
our
village
streets
to
get
upon
our
cheeks
the
living
breath
of
it
for
four
years
the
men
of
american
cities
villages
and
farms
walked
across
the
smoking
embers
of
a
burning
land
advancing
and
receding
as
the
flame
of
that
universal
passionate
thing
swept
down
upon
them
or
receded
toward
the
smoking
is
it
so
strange
that
they
could
not
come
home
and
begin
again
peacefully
painting
houses
or
mending
broken
shoes
a
something
in
them
cried
out
it
sent
them
to
bluster
and
boast
upon
the
street
corners
when
people
passing
continued
to
think
only
of
their
brick
laying
and
of
their
shovelling
of
corn
into
cars
when
the
sons
of
these
war
gods
walking
home
at
evening
and
hearing
the
vain
boastings
of
the
fathers
began
to
doubt
even
the
facts
of
the
great
struggle
a
something
snapped
in
their
brains
and
they
fell
to
chattering
and
shouting
their
vain
boastings
to
all
as
they
looked
hungrily
about
for
believing
eyes
when
our
own
thomas
carlyle
comes
to
write
of
our
civil
war
he
will
make
much
of
our
windy
mcphersons
he
will
see
something
big
and
pathetic
in
their
hungry
search
for
auditors
and
in
their
endless
war
talk
he
will
go
filled
with
eager
curiosity
into
little
halls
in
the
villages
and
think
of
the
men
who
coming
there
night
after
night
year
after
year
told
and
endlessly
monotonously
their
story
of
battle
let
us
hope
that
in
his
fervour
for
the
old
fellows
he
will
not
fail
to
treat
tenderly
the
families
of
those
veteran
talkers
the
families
that
with
their
breakfasts
and
their
dinners
by
the
fire
at
evening
through
fast
day
and
feast
day
at
weddings
and
at
funerals
got
again
and
again
endlessly
everlastingly
this
flow
of
war
words
let
him
reflect
that
peaceful
men
in
counties
do
not
by
choice
sleep
among
the
dogs
of
war
nor
wash
their
linen
in
the
blood
of
their
country
s
foe
let
him
in
his
sympathy
with
the
talkers
remember
with
kindness
the
heroism
of
the
listeners
on
a
summer
day
sam
mcpherson
sat
on
a
box
before
wildman
s
grocery
lost
in
thought
in
his
hand
he
held
the
little
yellow
account
book
and
in
this
he
buried
himself
striving
to
wipe
from
his
consciousness
a
scene
being
enacted
before
his
eyes
upon
the
street
the
realisation
of
the
fact
that
his
father
was
a
confirmed
liar
and
braggart
had
for
years
cast
a
shadow
over
his
days
and
the
shadow
had
been
made
blacker
by
the
fact
that
in
a
land
where
the
least
fortunate
can
laugh
in
the
face
of
want
he
had
more
than
once
stood
face
to
face
with
poverty
he
believed
that
the
logical
answer
to
the
situation
was
money
in
the
bank
and
with
all
the
ardour
of
his
boy
s
heart
he
strove
to
realise
that
answer
he
wanted
to
be
a
and
the
totals
at
the
foot
of
the
pages
in
the
soiled
yellow
bankbook
were
the
milestones
that
marked
the
progress
he
had
already
made
they
told
him
that
the
daily
struggles
with
fatty
the
long
tramps
through
caxton
s
streets
on
bleak
winter
evenings
and
the
saturday
nights
when
crowds
filled
the
stores
the
sidewalks
and
the
drinking
places
and
he
worked
among
them
tirelessly
and
persistently
were
not
without
fruit
suddenly
above
the
murmur
of
men
s
voices
on
the
street
his
father
s
voice
rose
loud
and
insistent
a
block
further
down
the
street
leaning
against
the
door
of
hunter
s
jewelry
store
windy
talked
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
pumping
his
arms
up
and
down
with
the
air
of
a
man
making
a
stump
speech
he
is
making
a
fool
of
himself
thought
sam
and
returned
to
his
bankbook
striving
in
the
contemplation
of
the
totals
at
the
foot
of
the
pages
to
shake
off
the
dull
anger
that
had
begun
to
burn
in
his
brain
glancing
up
again
he
saw
that
joe
wildman
son
of
the
grocer
and
a
boy
of
his
own
age
had
joined
the
group
of
men
laughing
and
jeering
at
windy
the
shadow
on
sam
s
face
grew
heavier
sam
had
been
at
joe
wildman
s
house
he
knew
the
air
of
plenty
and
of
comfort
that
hung
over
it
the
table
piled
high
with
meat
and
potatoes
the
group
of
children
laughing
and
eating
to
the
edge
of
gluttony
the
quiet
gentle
father
who
amid
the
clamour
and
the
noise
did
not
raise
his
voice
and
the
bustling
mother
as
a
contrast
to
this
scene
he
began
to
call
up
in
his
mind
a
picture
of
life
in
his
own
home
getting
a
kind
of
perverted
pleasure
out
of
his
dissatisfaction
with
it
he
saw
the
boasting
incompetent
father
telling
his
endless
tales
of
the
civil
war
and
complaining
of
his
wounds
the
tall
silent
mother
with
the
deep
lines
in
her
long
face
everlastingly
at
work
over
her
washtub
among
the
soiled
clothes
the
silent
meals
snatched
from
the
kitchen
table
and
the
long
winter
days
when
ice
formed
upon
his
mother
s
skirts
and
windy
idled
about
town
while
the
little
family
subsisted
upon
bowls
of
cornmeal
mush
everlastingly
repeated
now
even
from
where
he
sat
he
could
see
that
his
father
was
half
gone
in
drink
and
knew
that
he
was
boasting
of
his
part
in
the
civil
war
he
is
either
doing
that
or
telling
of
his
aristocratic
family
or
lying
about
his
birthplace
he
thought
resentfully
and
unable
any
longer
to
endure
the
sight
of
what
seemed
to
him
his
own
degradation
he
got
up
and
went
into
the
grocery
where
a
group
of
caxton
citizens
stood
talking
to
wildman
of
a
meeting
to
be
held
that
morning
at
the
town
hall
caxton
was
to
have
a
fourth
of
july
celebration
the
idea
born
in
the
heads
of
the
few
had
been
taken
up
by
the
many
rumours
of
it
had
run
through
the
streets
late
in
may
it
had
been
talked
of
in
geiger
s
drug
store
at
the
back
of
wildman
s
grocery
and
in
the
street
before
the
new
leland
house
john
telfer
the
town
s
one
man
of
leisure
had
for
weeks
been
going
from
place
to
place
discussing
the
details
with
prominent
men
now
a
mass
meeting
was
to
be
held
in
the
hall
over
geiger
s
drug
store
and
to
a
man
the
citizens
of
caxton
had
turned
out
for
the
meeting
the
housepainter
had
come
down
off
his
ladder
the
clerks
were
locking
the
doors
of
the
stores
men
went
along
the
streets
in
groups
bound
for
the
hall
as
they
went
they
shouted
to
each
other
the
old
town
has
woke
up
they
called
on
a
corner
by
hunter
s
jewelry
store
windy
mcpherson
leaned
against
a
building
and
harangued
the
passing
crowd
let
the
old
flag
wave
he
shouted
excitedly
let
the
men
of
caxton
show
the
true
blue
and
rally
to
the
old
that
s
right
windy
expostulate
with
them
shouted
a
wit
and
a
roar
of
laughter
drowned
windy
s
reply
sam
mcpherson
also
went
to
the
meeting
in
the
hall
he
came
out
of
the
grocery
store
with
wildman
and
went
along
the
street
looking
at
the
sidewalk
and
trying
not
to
see
the
drunken
man
talking
in
front
of
the
jewelry
store
at
the
hall
other
boys
stood
in
the
stairway
or
ran
up
and
down
the
sidewalk
talking
excitedly
but
sam
was
a
figure
in
the
town
s
life
and
his
right
to
push
in
among
the
men
was
not
questioned
he
squirmed
through
the
mass
of
legs
and
secured
a
seat
in
a
window
ledge
where
he
could
watch
the
men
come
in
and
find
seats
as
caxton
s
one
newsboy
sam
had
got
from
his
newspaper
selling
both
a
living
and
a
kind
of
standing
in
the
town
s
life
to
be
a
newsboy
or
a
bootblack
in
a
small
american
town
is
to
make
a
figure
in
the
world
do
not
all
of
the
poor
newsboys
in
the
books
become
great
men
and
is
not
this
boy
who
goes
among
us
so
industriously
day
after
day
likely
to
become
such
a
figure
is
it
not
a
duty
we
of
the
town
owe
to
future
greatness
that
we
push
him
forward
so
reasoned
the
men
of
caxton
and
paid
a
kind
of
court
to
the
boy
who
sat
on
the
window
ledge
of
the
hall
while
the
other
boys
of
the
town
waited
on
the
sidewalk
below
john
telfer
was
chairman
of
the
mass
meeting
he
was
always
chairman
of
public
meetings
in
caxton
the
industrious
silent
men
of
position
in
the
town
envied
his
easy
bantering
style
of
public
address
while
pretending
to
treat
it
with
scorn
he
talks
too
much
they
said
making
a
virtue
of
their
own
inability
with
apt
and
clever
words
telfer
did
not
wait
to
be
appointed
chairman
of
the
meeting
but
went
forward
climbed
the
little
raised
platform
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
usurped
the
chairmanship
he
walked
up
and
down
on
the
platform
bantering
with
the
crowd
answering
gibes
calling
to
men
getting
and
giving
keen
satisfaction
with
his
talent
when
the
hall
was
filled
with
men
he
called
the
meeting
to
order
appointed
committees
and
launched
into
a
harangue
he
told
of
plans
made
to
advertise
the
big
day
in
other
towns
and
to
get
low
railroad
rates
arranged
for
excursion
parties
the
programme
he
said
included
a
musical
carnival
with
brass
bands
from
other
towns
a
sham
battle
by
the
military
company
at
the
fairgrounds
horse
races
speeches
from
the
steps
of
the
town
hall
and
fireworks
in
the
evening
we
ll
show
them
a
live
town
here
he
declared
walking
up
and
down
the
platform
and
swinging
his
cane
while
the
crowd
applauded
and
shouted
its
approval
when
a
call
came
for
voluntary
subscriptions
to
pay
for
the
fun
the
audience
quieted
down
one
or
two
men
got
up
and
started
to
go
out
grumbling
that
it
was
a
waste
of
money
the
fate
of
the
celebration
was
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
telfer
arose
to
the
occasion
he
called
out
the
names
of
the
departing
and
made
jests
at
their
expense
so
that
they
dropped
back
into
their
chairs
unable
to
face
the
roaring
laughter
of
the
crowd
and
shouted
to
a
man
at
the
back
of
the
hall
to
close
and

men
began
getting
up
in
various
parts
of
the
hall
and
calling
out
sums
telfer
repeating
the
name
and
the
amount
in
a
loud
voice
to
young
tom
jedrow
clerk
in
the
bank
who
wrote
them
down
in
a
book
when
the
amount
subscribed
did
not
meet
with
his
approval
he
protested
and
the
crowd
backing
him
up
forced
the
increase
he
demanded
when
a
man
did
not
rise
he
shouted
at
him
and
the
man
answered
back
an
amount
suddenly
in
the
hall
a
diversion
arose
windy
mcpherson
emerged
from
the
crowd
at
the
back
of
the
hall
and
walked
down
the
centre
aisle
to
the
platform
he
walked
unsteadily
straightening
his
shoulders
and
thrusting
out
his
chin
when
he
got
to
the
front
of
the
hall
he
took
a
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
and
threw
it
on
the
platform
at
the
chairman
s
feet
from
one
of
the
boys
of
he
announced
in
a
loud
voice
the
crowd
shouted
and
clapped
its
hands
with
delight
as
telfer
picked
up
the
bills
and
ran
his
finger
over
them
seventeen
dollars
from
our
hero
the
mighty
mcpherson
he
shouted
while
the
bank
clerk
wrote
the
name
and
the
amount
in
the
book
and
the
crowd
continued
to
make
merry
over
the
title
given
the
drunken
soldier
by
the
chairman
the
boy
on
the
window
ledge
slipped
to
the
floor
and
stood
with
burning
cheeks
behind
the
mass
of
men
he
knew
that
at
home
his
mother
was
doing
a
family
washing
for
lesley
the
shoe
merchant
who
had
given
five
dollars
to
the
fund
and
the
resentment
he
had
felt
on
seeing
his
father
talking
to
the
crowd
before
the
jewelry
store
blazed
up
anew
after
the
taking
of
subscriptions
men
in
various
parts
of
the
hall
began
making
suggestions
for
added
features
for
the
great
day
to
some
of
the
speakers
the
crowd
listened
respectfully
at
others
they
hooted
an
old
man
with
a
grey
beard
told
a
long
rambling
story
of
a
celebration
of
his
boyhood
when
voices
interrupted
he
protested
and
shook
his
fist
in
the
air
pale
with
indignation
oh
sit
down
old
daddy
shouted
freedom
smith
and
a
murmur
of
applause
greeted
this
sensible
suggestion
another
man
got
up
and
began
to
talk
he
had
an
idea
we
will
have
he
said
a
bugler
mounted
on
a
white
horse
who
will
ride
through
the
town
at
dawn
blowing
the
reveille
at
midnight
he
will
stand
on
the
steps
of
the
town
hall
and
blow
taps
to
end
the
the
crowd
applauded
the
idea
had
caught
their
fancy
and
had
instantly
taken
a
place
in
their
minds
as
one
of
the
real
events
of
the
day
again
windy
mcpherson
emerged
from
the
crowd
at
the
back
of
the
hall
raising
his
hand
for
silence
he
told
the
crowd
that
he
was
a
bugler
that
he
had
been
a
regimental
bugler
for
two
years
during
the
civil
war
he
said
that
he
would
gladly
volunteer
for
the
place
the
crowd
shouted
and
john
telfer
waved
his
hand
the
white
horse
for
you
mcpherson
he
said
sam
mcpherson
wriggled
along
the
wall
and
out
at
the
now
unbolted
door
he
was
filled
with
astonishment
at
his
father
s
folly
and
was
still
more
astonished
at
the
folly
of
these
other
men
in
accepting
his
statement
and
handing
over
the
important
place
for
the
big
day
he
knew
that
his
father
must
have
had
some
part
in
the
war
as
he
was
a
member
of
the
but
he
had
no
faith
at
all
in
the
stories
he
had
heard
him
relate
of
his
experiences
in
the
war
sometimes
he
caught
himself
wondering
if
there
ever
had
been
such
a
war
and
thought
that
it
must
be
a
lie
like
everything
else
in
the
life
of
windy
mcpherson
for
years
he
had
wondered
why
some
sensible
solid
person
like
valmore
or
wildman
did
not
rise
and
in
a
way
tell
the
world
that
no
such
thing
as
the
civil
war
had
ever
been
fought
that
it
was
merely
a
figment
in
the
minds
of
pompous
old
men
demanding
unearned
glory
of
their
fellows
now
hurrying
along
the
street
with
burning
cheeks
he
decided
that
after
all
there
must
have
been
such
a
war
he
had
had
the
same
feeling
about
birthplaces
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
people
were
born
he
had
heard
his
father
claim
as
his
birthplace
kentucky
texas
north
carolina
louisiana
and
scotland
the
thing
had
left
a
kind
of
defect
in
his
mind
to
the
end
of
his
life
when
he
heard
a
man
tell
the
place
of
his
birth
he
looked
up
suspiciously
and
a
shadow
of
doubt
crossed
his
mind
from
the
mass
meeting
sam
went
home
to
his
mother
and
presented
the
case
bluntly
the
thing
will
have
to
be
stopped
he
declared
standing
with
blazing
eyes
before
her
washtub
it
is
too
public
he
can
t
blow
a
bugle
i
know
he
can
t
the
whole
town
will
have
another
laugh
at
our
jane
mcpherson
listened
in
silence
to
the
boy
s
outburst
then
turning
went
back
to
rubbing
clothes
avoiding
his
eyes
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
trousers
pocket
sam
stared
sullenly
at
the
ground
a
sense
of
justice
told
him
not
to
press
the
matter
but
as
he
walked
away
from
the
washtub
and
out
at
the
kitchen
door
he
hoped
there
would
be
plain
talk
of
the
matter
at
supper
time
the
old
fool
he
protested
addressing
the
empty
street
he
is
going
to
make
a
show
of
himself
when
windy
mcpherson
came
home
that
evening
something
in
the
eyes
of
the
silent
wife
and
the
sullen
face
of
the
boy
startled
him
he
passed
over
lightly
his
wife
s
silence
but
looked
closely
at
his
son
he
felt
that
he
faced
a
crisis
in
the
emergency
he
was
magnificent
with
a
flourish
he
told
of
the
mass
meeting
and
declared
that
the
citizens
of
caxton
had
arisen
as
one
man
to
demand
that
he
take
the
responsible
place
as
official
bugler
then
turning
he
glared
across
the
table
at
his
son
sam
openly
defiant
announced
that
he
did
not
believe
his
father
capable
of
blowing
a
bugle
windy
roared
with
amazement
he
rose
from
the
table
declaring
in
a
loud
voice
that
the
boy
had
wronged
him
he
swore
that
he
had
been
for
two
years
bugler
on
the
staff
of
a
colonel
and
launched
into
a
long
story
of
a
surprise
by
the
enemy
while
his
regiment
lay
asleep
in
their
tents
and
of
his
standing
in
the
face
of
a
storm
of
bullets
and
blowing
his
comrades
to
action
putting
one
hand
on
his
forehead
he
rocked
back
and
forth
as
though
about
to
fall
declaring
that
he
was
striving
to
keep
back
the
tears
wrenched
from
him
by
the
injustice
of
his
son
s
insinuation
and
shouting
so
that
his
voice
carried
far
down
the
street
he
declared
with
an
oath
that
the
town
of
caxton
should
ring
and
echo
with
his
bugling
as
the
sleeping
camp
had
echoed
with
it
that
night
in
the
virginia
wood
then
dropping
again
into
his
chair
and
resting
his
head
upon
his
hand
he
assumed
a
look
of
patient
resignation
windy
mcpherson
was
victorious
in
the
little
house
a
great
stir
and
bustle
of
preparation
arose
putting
on
his
white
overalls
and
forgetting
for
the
time
his
honourable
wounds
the
father
went
day
after
day
to
his
work
as
a
housepainter
he
dreamed
of
a
new
blue
uniform
for
the
great
day
and
in
the
end
achieved
the
realisation
of
his
dreams
not
however
without
material
assistance
from
what
was
known
in
the
house
as
mother
s
wash
and
the
boy
convinced
by
the
story
of
the
midnight
attack
in
the
woods
of
virginia
began
against
his
judgment
to
build
once
more
an
old
dream
of
his
father
s
reformation
boylike
the
scepticism
was
thrown
to
the
winds
and
he
entered
with
zeal
into
the
plans
for
the
great
day
as
he
went
through
the
quiet
residence
streets
delivering
the
late
evening
papers
he
threw
back
his
head
and
revelled
in
the
thought
of
a
tall
figure
on
a
great
white
horse
passing
like
a
knight
before
the
gaping
people
in
a
fervent
moment
he
even
drew
money
from
his
carefully
bank
account
and
sent
it
to
a
firm
in
chicago
to
pay
for
a
shining
new
bugle
that
would
complete
the
picture
he
had
in
his
mind
and
when
the
evening
papers
were
distributed
he
hurried
home
to
sit
on
the
porch
before
the
house
discussing
with
his
sister
kate
the
honours
that
had
alighted
upon
their
family
with
the
coming
of
dawn
on
the
great
day
the
three
mcphersons
hurried
hand
in
hand
toward
main
street
in
the
street
on
all
sides
of
them
they
saw
people
coming
out
of
houses
rubbing
their
eyes
and
buttoning
their
coats
as
they
went
along
the
sidewalk
all
of
caxton
seemed
abroad
in
main
street
the
people
were
packed
on
the
sidewalk
and
massed
on
the
curb
and
in
the
doorways
of
the
stores
heads
appeared
at
windows
flags
waved
from
roofs
or
hung
from
ropes
stretched
across
the
street
and
a
great
murmur
of
voices
broke
the
silence
of
the
dawn
sam
s
heart
beat
so
that
he
was
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
back
the
tears
from
his
eyes
he
thought
with
a
gasp
of
the
days
of
anxiety
that
had
passed
when
the
new
bugle
had
not
come
from
the
chicago
company
and
in
retrospect
he
suffered
again
the
horror
of
the
days
of
waiting
it
had
been
all
important
he
could
not
blame
his
father
for
raving
and
shouting
about
the
house
he
himself
had
felt
like
raving
and
had
put
another
dollar
of
his
savings
into
telegrams
before
the
treasure
was
finally
in
his
hands
now
the
thought
that
it
might
not
have
come
sickened
him
and
a
little
prayer
of
thankfulness
rose
from
his
lips
to
be
sure
one
might
have
been
secured
from
a
nearby
town
but
not
a
new
shining
one
to
go
with
his
father
s
new
blue
uniform
a
cheer
broke
from
the
crowd
massed
along
the
street
into
the
street
rode
a
tall
figure
seated
upon
a
white
horse
the
horse
was
from
culvert
s
livery
and
the
boys
there
had
woven
ribbons
into
its
mane
and
tail
windy
mcpherson
sitting
very
straight
in
the
saddle
and
looking
wonderfully
striking
in
the
new
blue
uniform
and
the
campaign
hat
had
the
air
of
a
conqueror
come
to
receive
the
homage
of
the
town
he
wore
a
gold
band
across
his
chest
and
against
his
hip
rested
the
shining
bugle
with
stern
eyes
he
looked
down
upon
the
people
the
lump
in
the
throat
of
the
boy
hurt
more
and
more
a
great
wave
of
pride
ran
over
him
submerging
him
in
a
moment
he
forgot
all
the
past
humiliations
the
father
had
brought
upon
his
family
and
understood
why
his
mother
remained
silent
when
he
in
his
blindness
had
wanted
to
protest
against
her
seeming
indifference
glancing
furtively
up
he
saw
a
tear
lying
upon
her
cheek
and
felt
that
he
too
would
like
to
sob
aloud
his
pride
and
happiness
slowly
and
with
stately
stride
the
horse
walked
up
the
street
between
the
rows
of
silent
waiting
people
in
front
of
the
town
hall
the
tall
military
figure
rising
in
the
saddle
took
one
haughty
look
at
the
multitude
and
then
putting
the
bugle
to
his
lips
blew
out
of
the
bugle
came
only
a
thin
piercing
shriek
followed
by
a
squawk
again
windy
put
the
bugle
to
his
lips
and
again
the
same
dismal
squawk
was
his
only
reward
on
his
face
was
a
look
of
helpless
boyish
astonishment
and
in
a
moment
the
people
knew
it
was
only
another
of
windy
mcpherson
s
pretensions
he
couldn
t
blow
a
bugle
at
all
a
great
shout
of
laughter
rolled
down
the
street
men
and
women
sat
on
the
curbstones
and
laughed
until
they
were
tired
then
looking
at
the
figure
upon
the
motionless
horse
they
laughed
again
windy
looked
about
him
with
troubled
eyes
it
is
doubtful
if
he
had
ever
had
a
bugle
to
his
lips
until
that
moment
but
he
was
filled
with
wonder
and
astonishment
that
the
reveille
did
not
roll
forth
he
had
heard
the
thing
a
thousand
times
and
had
it
clearly
in
his
mind
with
all
his
heart
he
wanted
it
to
roll
forth
and
could
picture
the
street
ringing
with
it
and
the
applause
of
the
people
the
thing
he
felt
was
in
him
and
it
was
only
a
fatal
blunder
in
nature
that
it
did
not
come
out
at
the
flaring
end
of
the
bugle
he
was
amazed
at
this
dismal
end
of
his
great
moment
he
was
always
amazed
and
helpless
before
facts
the
crowd
began
gathering
about
the
motionless
astonished
figure
laughter
continuing
to
send
them
off
into
something
near
convulsions
grasping
the
bridle
of
the
horse
john
telfer
began
leading
it
off
up
the
street
boys
whooped
and
shouted
at
the
rider
blow
blow
the
three
mcphersons
stood
in
a
doorway
leading
into
a
shoe
store
the
boy
and
the
mother
white
and
speechless
with
humiliation
dared
not
look
at
each
other
in
the
flood
of
shame
sweeping
over
them
they
stared
straight
before
them
with
hard
stony
eyes
the
procession
led
by
john
telfer
at
the
bridle
of
the
white
horse
marched
down
the
street
looking
up
the
eyes
of
the
laughing
shouting
man
met
those
of
the
boy
and
a
look
of
pain
shot
across
his
face
dropping
the
bridle
he
hurried
away
through
the
crowd
the
procession
moved
on
and
watching
their
chance
the
mother
and
the
two
children
crept
home
along
side

weeping
bitterly
leaving

went
straight
on
down
a
sandy
road
toward
a
small
wood

lesson
i
ve
got

he
muttered
over
and
over
as
he
went
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
he
stopped
and
leaning
on
a
rail
fence
watched
until
he
saw
his
mother
come
out
to
the
pump
in
the
back
yard
she
had
begun
to
draw
water
for
the
day
s
washing
for
her
also
the
holiday
was
at
an
end
a
flood
of
tears
ran
down
the
boy
s
cheeks
and
he
shook
his
fist
in
the
direction
of
the
town
you
may
laugh
at
that
fool
windy
but
you
shall
never
laugh
at

cried
his
voice
shaking
with
excitement
chapter
iii
one
evening
when
he
had
grown
so
that
he
outtopped
windy
sam
mcpherson
returned
from
his
paper
route
to
find
his
mother
arrayed
in
her
black
dress
an
evangelist
was
at
work
in
caxton
and
she
had
decided
to
hear
him
sam
shuddered
in
the
house
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
when
jane
mcpherson
went
to
church
her
son
went
with
her
there
was
nothing
said
jane
mcpherson
did
all
things
without
words
always
there
was
nothing
said
now
she
stood
waiting
in
her
black
dress
when
her
son
came
in
at
the
door
and
he
hurriedly
put
on
his
best
clothes
and
went
with
her
to
the
brick
church
valmore
john
telfer
and
freedom
smith
who
had
taken
upon
themselves
a
kind
of
common
guardianship
of
the
boy
and
with
whom
he
spent
evening
after
evening
at
the
back
of
wildman
s
grocery
did
not
go
to
church
they
talked
of
religion
and
seemed
singularly
curious
and
interested
in
what
other
men
thought
on
the
subject
but
they
did
not
allow
themselves
to
be
coaxed
into
a
house
of
worship
to
the
boy
who
had
become
a
fourth
member
of
the
evening
gatherings
at
the
back
of
the
grocery
store
they
would
not
talk
of
god
answering
the
direct
questions
he
sometimes
asked
by
changing
the
subject
once
telfer
the
reader
of
poetry
answered
the
boy
sell
papers
and
fill
your
pockets
with
money
but
let
your
soul
sleep
he
said
sharply
in
the
absence
of
the
others
wildman
talked
more
freely
he
was
a
spiritualist
and
tried
to
make
sam
see
the
beauties
of
that
faith
on
long
summer
afternoons
the
grocer
and
the
boy
spent
hours
driving
through
the
streets
in
a
rattling
old
delivery
wagon
the
man
striving
earnestly
to
make
clear
to
the
boy
the
shadowy
ideas
of
god
that
were
in
his
mind
although
windy
mcpherson
had
been
the
leader
of
a
bible
class
in
his
youth
and
had
been
a
moving
spirit
at
revival
meetings
during
his
early
days
in
caxton
he
no
longer
went
to
church
and
his
wife
did
not
ask
him
to
go
on
sunday
mornings
he
lay
abed
if
there
was
work
to
be
done
about
the
house
or
yard
he
complained
of
his
wounds
he
complained
of
his
wounds
when
the
rent
fell
due
and
when
there
was
a
shortage
of
food
in
the
house
later
in
his
life
and
after
the
death
of
jane
mcpherson
the
old
soldier
married
the
widow
of
a
farmer
by
whom
he
had
four
children
and
with
whom
he
went
to
church
twice
on
sunday
kate
wrote
sam
one
of
her
infrequent
letters
about
it
he
has
met
his
match
she
said
and
was
tremendously
pleased
in
church
on
sunday
mornings
sam
went
regularly
to
sleep
putting
his
head
on
his
mother
s
arm
and
sleeping
throughout
the
service
jane
mcpherson
loved
to
have
the
boy
there
beside
her
it
was
the
one
thing
in
life
they
did
together
and
she
did
not
mind
his
sleeping
the
time
away
knowing
how
late
he
had
been
upon
the
streets
at
the
paper
selling
on
saturday
evenings
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
filled
with
tenderness
and
sympathy
once
the
minister
a
man
with
brown
beard
and
hard
mouth
spoke
to
her
can
t
you
keep
him
awake
he
asked
impatiently
he
needs
the
sleep
she
said
and
hurried
past
the
minister
and
out
of
the
church
looking
ahead
of
her
and
frowning
the
evening
of
the
evangelist
meeting
was
a
summer
evening
fallen
on
a
winter
month
all
day
the
warm
winds
had
come
up
from
the
southwest
mud
lay
soft
and
deep
in
the
streets
and
among
the
little
pools
of
water
on
the
sidewalks
were
dry
spots
from
which
steam
arose
nature
had
forgotten
herself
a
day
that
should
have
sent
old
fellows
to
their
nests
behind
stoves
in
stores
sent
them
forth
to
loaf
in
the
sun
the
night
fell
warm
and
cloudy
a
thunder
storm
threatened
in
the
month
of
february
sam
walked
along
the
sidewalk
with
his
mother
bound
for
the
brick
church
wearing
a
new
grey
overcoat
the
night
did
not
demand
the
overcoat
but
sam
wore
it
out
of
an
excess
of
pride
in
its
possession
the
overcoat
had
an
air
it
had
been
made
by
gunther
the
tailor
after
a
design
sketched
on
the
back
of
a
piece
of
wrapping
paper
by
john
telfer
and
had
been
paid
for
out
of
the
newsboy
s
savings
the
little
german
tailor
after
a
talk
with
valmore
and
telfer
had
made
it
at
a
marvellously
low
price
sam
swaggered
as
he
walked
he
did
not
sleep
in
church
that
evening
indeed
he
found
the
quiet
church
filled
with
a
medley
of
strange
noises
folding
carefully
the
new
coat
and
laying
it
beside
him
on
the
seat
he
looked
with
interest
at
the
people
feeling
within
him
something
of
the
nervous
excitement
with
which
the
air
was
charged
the
evangelist
a
short
man
in
a
grey
business
suit
seemed
to
the
boy
out
of
place
in
the
church
he
had
the
assured
air
of
the
travelling
men
who
come
to
the
new
leland
house
and
sam
thought
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
goods
to
be
sold
he
did
not
stand
quietly
back
of
the
pulpit
giving
out
the
text
as
did
the
minister
nor
did
he
sit
with
closed
eyes
and
clasped
hands
waiting
for
the
choir
to
finish
singing
while
the
choir
sang
he
ran
up
and
down
the
platform
waving
his
arms
and
shouting
excitedly
to
the
people
on
the
church
benches
sing
sing
sing
for
the
glory
of
god
sing
when
the
song
was
finished
he
began
talking
quietly
at
first
of
life
in
the
town
as
he
talked
he
grew
more
and
more
excited
the
town
is
a
cesspool
of
vice
he
shouted
it
reeks
with
evil
the
devil
counts
it
a
suburb
of
hell
his
voice
rose
and
sweat
ran
off
his
face
a
sort
of
frenzy
seized
him
he
pulled
off
his
coat
and
throwing
it
over
a
chair
ran
up
and
down
the
platform
and
into
the
aisles
among
the
people
shouting
threatening
pleading
people
began
to
stir
uneasily
in
their
seats
jane
mcpherson
stared
stonily
at
the
back
of
the
woman
in
front
of
her
sam
was
horribly
frightened
the
newsboy
of
caxton
was
not
without
a
hunger
for
religion
like
all
boys
he
thought
much
and
often
of
death
in
the
night
he
sometimes
awakened
cold
with
fear
thinking
that
death
must
be
just
without
the
door
of
his
room
waiting
for
him
when
in
the
winter
he
had
a
cold
and
coughed
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
tuberculosis
once
when
he
was
taken
with
a
fever
he
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
that
he
had
died
and
was
walking
on
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
over
a
ravine
filled
with
lost
souls
that
shrieked
with
terror
when
he
awoke
he
prayed
had
some
one
come
into
his
room
and
heard
his
prayer
he
would
have
been
ashamed
on
winter
evenings
as
he
walked
through
the
dark
streets
with
the
papers
under
his
arm
he
thought
of
his
soul
as
he
thought
a
tenderness
came
over
him
a
lump
came
into
his
throat
and
he
pitied
himself
he
felt
that
there
was
something
missing
in
his
life
something
he
wanted
very
badly
under
john
telfer
s
influence
the
boy
who
had
quit
school
to
devote
himself
to
money
making
read
walt
whitman
and
had
a
season
of
admiring
his
own
body
with
its
straight
white
legs
and
the
head
that
was
poised
so
jauntily
on
the
body
sometimes
he
would
awaken
on
summer
nights
and
be
so
filled
with
strange
longing
that
he
would
creep
out
of
bed
and
pushing
open
the
window
sit
upon
the
floor
his
bare
legs
sticking
out
beyond
his
white
nightgown
and
thus
sitting
yearn
eagerly
toward
some
fine
impulse
some
call
some
sense
of
bigness
and
of
leadership
that
was
absent
from
the
necessities
of
the
life
he
led
he
looked
at
the
stars
and
listened
to
the
night
noises
so
filled
with
longing
that
the
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
once
after
the
affair
of
the
bugle
jane
mcpherson
had
been
ill
and
the
first
touch
of
the
finger
of
death
reaching
out
to
her
had
sat
with
her
son
in
the
warm
darkness
in
the
little
grass
plot
at
the
front
of
the
house
it
was
a
clear
warm
starlit
evening
without
a
moon
and
as
the
two
sat
closely
together
a
sense
of
the
coming
of
death
crept
over
the
mother
at
the
evening
meal
windy
mcpherson
had
talked
voluminously
ranting
and
shouting
about
the
house
he
said
that
a
housepainter
who
had
a
real
sense
of
colour
had
no
business
trying
to
work
in
a
hole
like
caxton
he
had
been
in
trouble
with
a
housewife
about
a
colour
he
had
mixed
for
painting
a
porch
floor
and
at
his
own
table
he
raved
about
the
woman
and
what
he
declared
her
lack
of
even
a
primitive
sense
of
colour
i
am
sick
of
it
all
he
shouted
going
out
of
the
house
and
up
the
street
with
uncertain
steps
his
wife
had
been
unmoved
by
his
outburst
but
in
the
presence
of
the
quiet
boy
whose
chair
touched
her
own
she
trembled
with
a
strange
new
fear
and
began
to
talk
of
the
life
after
death
making
effort
after
effort
to
get
at
what
she
wanted
to
say
and
only
succeeding
in
finding
expression
for
her
thoughts
in
little
sentences
broken
by
long
painful
pauses
she
told
the
boy
she
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
there
was
some
kind
of
future
life
and
that
she
believed
she
should
see
and
live
with
him
again
after
they
had
finished
with
this
world
one
day
the
minister
who
had
been
annoyed
because
he
had
slept
in
his
church
stopped
sam
on
the
street
to
talk
to
him
of
his
soul
he
said
that
the
boy
should
be
thinking
of
making
himself
one
of
the
brothers
in
christ
by
joining
the
church
sam
listened
silently
to
the
talk
of
the
man
whom
he
instinctively
disliked
but
in
his
silence
felt
there
was
something
insincere
with
all
his
heart
he
wanted
to
repeat
a
sentence
he
had
heard
from
the
lips
of
valmore
how
can
they
believe
and
not
lead
a
life
of
simple
fervent
devotion
to
their
belief
he
thought
himself
superior
to
the
man
who
talked
with
him
and
had
he
been
able
to
express
what
was
in
his
heart
he
might
have
said
look
here
man
i
am
made
of
different
stuff
from
all
the
people
there
at
the
church
i
am
new
clay
to
be
moulded
into
a
new
man
not
even
my
mother
is
like
me
i
do
not
accept
your
ideas
of
life
just
because
you
say
they
are
good
any
more
than
i
accept
windy
mcpherson
just
because
he
happens
to
be
my
during
one
winter
sam
spent
evening
after
evening
reading
the
bible
in
his
room
it
was
after
kate
s
marriage
she
had
got
into
an
affair
with
a
young
farmer
that
had
kept
her
name
upon
the
tongues
of
whisperers
for
months
but
was
now
a
housewife
on
a
farm
at
the
edge
of
a
village
some
miles
from
caxton
and
the
mother
was
again
at
her
endless
task
among
the
soiled
clothes
in
the
kitchen
and
windy
mcpherson
off
drinking
and
boasting
about
town
sam
read
the
book
in
secret
he
had
a
lamp
on
a
little
stand
beside
his
bed
and
a
novel
lent
him
by
john
telfer
beside
it
when
his
mother
came
up
the
stairway
he
slipped
the
bible
under
the
cover
of
the
bed
and
became
absorbed
in
the
novel
he
thought
it
something
not
quite
in
keeping
with
his
aims
as
a
business
man
and
a
money
getter
to
be
concerned
about
his
soul
he
wanted
to
conceal
his
concern
but
with
all
his
heart
wanted
to
get
hold
of
the
message
of
the
strange
book
about
which
men
wrangled
hour
after
hour
on
winter
evenings
in
the
store
he
did
not
get
it
and
after
a
time
he
stopped
reading
the
book
left
to
himself
he
might
have
sensed
its
meaning
but
on
all
sides
of
him
were
the
voices
of
the
men
the
men
at
wildman
s
who
owned
to
no
faith
and
yet
were
filled
with
dogmatisms
as
they
talked
behind
the
stove
in
the
grocery
the
minister
in
the
brick
church
the
shouting
pleading
evangelists
who
came
to
visit
the
town
in
the
winter
the
gentle
old
grocer
who
talked
vaguely
of
the
spirit
world
all
these
voices
were
at
the
mind
of
the
boy
pleading
insisting
demanding
not
that
christ
s
simple
message
that
men
love
one
another
to
the
end
that
they
work
together
for
the
common
good
be
accepted
but
that
their
own
complex
interpretation
of
his
word
be
taken
to
the
end
that
souls
be
saved
in
the
end
the
boy
of
caxton
got
to
the
place
where
he
had
a
dread
of
the
word
soul
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
mention
of
the
word
in
conversation
was
something
shameful
and
to
think
of
the
word
or
the
shadowy
something
for
which
the
word
stood
an
act
of
cowardice
in
his
mind
the
soul
became
a
thing
to
be
hidden
away
covered
up
not
thought
of
one
might
be
allowed
to
speak
of
the
matter
at
the
moment
of
death
but
for
the
healthy
man
or
boy
to
have
the
thought
of
his
soul
in
his
mind
or
word
of
it
on
his
lips
one
might
better
become
blatantly
profane
and
go
to
the
devil
with
a
swagger
with
delight
he
imagined
himself
as
dying
and
with
his
last
breath
tossing
a
round
oath
into
the
air
of
his
death
chamber
in
the
meantime
sam
continued
to
have
inexplicable
longings
and
hopes
he
kept
surprising
himself
by
the
changing
aspect
of
his
own
viewpoint
of
life
he
found
himself
indulging
in
the
most
petty
meannesses
and
following
these
with
flashes
of
a
kind
of
loftiness
of
mind
looking
at
a
girl
passing
in
the
street
he
had
unbelievably
mean
thoughts
and
the
next
day
passing
the
same
girl
a
line
caught
from
the
babbling
of
john
telfer
came
to
his
lips
and
he
went
his
way
muttering
june
s
twice
june
since
she
breathed
it
with
and
then
into
the
complex
nature
of
this
boy
came
the
sex
motive
already
he
dreamed
of
having
women
in
his
arms
he
looked
shyly
at
the
ankles
of
women
crossing
the
street
and
listened
eagerly
when
the
crowd
about
the
stove
in
wildman
s
fell
to
telling
smutty
stories
he
sank
to
unbelievable
depths
of
triviality
in
sordidness
looking
shyly
into
dictionaries
for
words
that
appealed
to
the
animal
lust
in
his
queerly
perverted
mind
and
when
he
came
across
it
lost
entirely
the
beauty
of
the
old
bible
tale
of
ruth
in
the
suggestion
of
intimacy
between
man
and
woman
that
it
brought
to
him
and
yet
sam
mcpherson
was
no
boy
he
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
quality
of
intellectual
honesty
that
appealed
strongly
to
the
old
blacksmith
valmore
he
had
awakened
something
like
love
in
the
hearts
of
the
women
school
teachers
in
the
caxton
schools
at
least
one
of
whom
continued
to
interest
herself
in
him
taking
him
with
her
on
walks
along
country
roads
and
talking
to
him
constantly
of
the
development
of
his
mind
and
he
was
the
friend
and
boon
companion
of
telfer
the
dandy
the
reader
of
poems
the
keen
lover
of
life
the
boy
was
struggling
to
find
himself
one
night
when
the
sex
call
kept
him
awake
he
got
up
and
dressed
and
went
and
stood
in
the
rain
by
the
creek
in
miller
s
pasture
the
wind
swept
the
rain
across
the
face
of
the
water
and
a
sentence
flashed
through
his
mind
the
little
feet
of
the
rain
run
on
the
there
was
a
quality
of
almost
lyrical
beauty
in
the
iowa
boy
and
this
boy
who
couldn
t
get
hold
of
his
impulse
toward
god
whose
sex
impulses
made
him
at
times
mean
at
times
full
of
beauty
and
who
had
decided
that
the
impulse
toward
bargaining
and
money
getting
was
the
impulse
in
him
most
worth
cherishing
now
sat
beside
his
mother
in
church
and
watched
with
eyes
the
man
who
took
off
his
coat
who
sweated
profusely
and
who
called
the
town
in
which
he
lived
a
cesspool
of
vice
and
its
citizens
wards
of
the
devil
the
evangelist
from
talking
of
the
town
began
talking
instead
of
heaven
and
hell
and
his
earnestness
caught
the
attention
of
the
listening
boy
who
began
seeing
pictures
into
his
mind
there
came
a
picture
of
a
burning
pit
of
fire
in
which
great
flames
leaped
about
the
heads
of
the
people
who
writhed
in
the
pit
art
sherman
would
be
there
thought
sam
materialising
the
picture
he
saw
nothing
can
save
him
he
keeps
a
filled
with
pity
for
the
man
he
saw
in
the
picture
of
the
burning
pit
his
mind
centered
on
the
person
of
art
sherman
he
liked
art
sherman
more
than
once
he
had
felt
the
touch
of
human
kindness
in
the
man
the
roaring
blustering
saloonkeeper
had
helped
the
boy
sell
and
collect
for
newspapers
pay
the
kid
or
get
out
of
the
place
the
man
roared
at
drunken
men
leaning
on
the
bar
and
then
looking
into
the
burning
pit
sam
thought
of
mike
mccarthy
for
whom
he
had
at
that
moment
a
kind
of
passion
akin
to
a
young
girl
s
blind
devotion
to
her
lover
with
a
shudder
he
realised
that
mike
also
would
go
into
the
pit
for
he
had
heard
mike
laughing
at
churches
and
declaring
there
was
no
god
the
evangelist
ran
upon
the
platform
and
called
to
the
people
demanding
that
they
stand
upon
their
feet
stand
up
for
jesus
he
shouted
stand
up
and
be
counted
among
the
host
of
the
lord
in
the
church
people
began
getting
to
their
feet
jane
mcpherson
stood
with
the
others
sam
did
not
stand
he
crept
behind
his
mother
s
dress
hoping
to
pass
through
the
storm
unnoticed
the
call
to
the
faithful
to
stand
was
a
thing
to
be
complied
with
or
resisted
as
the
people
might
wish
it
was
something
entirely
outside
of
himself
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
count
himself
among
either
the
lost
or
the
saved
again
the
choir
began
singing
and
a
businesslike
movement
began
among
the
people
men
and
women
went
up
and
down
the
aisles
clasping
the
hands
of
people
in
the
pews
talking
and
praying
aloud
welcome
among
us
they
said
to
certain
ones
who
stood
upon
their
feet
it
gladdens
our
hearts
to
see
you
among
us
we
are
happy
at
seeing
you
in
the
fold
among
the
saved
it
is
good
to
confess
suddenly
a
voice
from
the
bench
back
of
him
struck
terror
to
sam
s
heart
jim
williams
who
worked
in
sawyer
s
barber
shop
was
upon
his
knees
and
in
a
loud
voice
was
praying
for
the
soul
of
sam
mcpherson
lord
help
this
erring
boy
who
goes
up
and
down
in
the
company
of
sinners
and
publicans
he
shouted
in
a
moment
the
terror
of
death
and
the
fiery
pit
that
had
possessed
him
passed
and
sam
was
filled
instead
with
blind
dumb
rage
he
remembered
that
this
same
jim
williams
had
treated
lightly
the
honour
of
his
sister
at
the
time
of
her
disappearance
and
he
wanted
to
get
upon
his
feet
and
pour
out
his
wrath
on
the
head
of
the
man
who
he
felt
had
betrayed
him
they
would
not
have
seen
me
he
thought
this
is
a
fine
trick
jim
williams
has
played
me
i
shall
be
even
with
him
for
he
got
to
his
feet
and
stood
beside
his
mother
he
had
no
qualms
about
passing
himself
off
as
one
of
the
lambs
safely
within
the
fold
his
mind
was
bent
upon
quieting
jim
williams
prayers
and
avoiding
the
attention
of
the
people
the
minister
began
calling
on
the
standing
people
to
testify
of
their
salvation
from
various
parts
of
the
church
the
people
spoke
out
some
loudly
and
boldly
and
with
a
ring
of
confidence
in
their
voices
some
tremblingly
and
hesitatingly
one
woman
wept
loudly
shouting
between
the
paroxysms
of
sobbing
that
seized
her
the
weight
of
my
sins
is
heavy
on
my
girls
and
young
men
when
called
on
by
the
minister
responded
with
shamed
hesitating
voices
asking
that
a
verse
of
some
hymn
be
sung
or
quoting
a
line
of
scripture
at
the
back
of
the
church
the
evangelist
with
one
of
the
deacons
and
two
or
three
women
had
gathered
about
a
small
woman
the
wife
of
a
baker
to
whom
sam
delivered
papers
they
were
urging
her
to
rise
and
get
within
the
fold
and
sam
turned
and
watched
her
curiously
his
sympathy
going
out
to
her
with
all
his
heart
he
hoped
that
she
would
continue
doggedly
shaking
her
head
suddenly
the
irrepressible
jim
williams
broke
forth
again
a
quiver
ran
over
sam
s
body
and
the
blood
rose
to
his
cheeks
here
is
another
sinner
saved
shouted
jim
pointing
to
the
standing
boy
count
this
boy
sam
mcpherson
in
the
fold
among
the
on
the
platform
the
minister
stood
upon
a
chair
and
looked
over
the
heads
of
the
people
an
ingratiating
smile
played
about
his
lips
let
us
hear
from
the
young
man
sam
mcpherson
he
said
raising
his
hand
for
silence
and
then
encouragingly
sam
what
have
you
to
say
for
the
lord
become
the
centre
for
the
attention
of
the
people
in
the
church
sam
was
the
rage
against
jim
williams
was
forgotten
in
the
spasm
of
fear
that
seized
him
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
church
and
thought
longingly
of
the
quiet
street
outside
he
hesitated
stammered
grew
more
red
and
uncertain
and
finally
burst
out
the
lord
he
said
and
then
looked
about
hopelessly
the
lord
maketh
me
to
lie
out
in
green
in
the
seats
behind
him
a
titter
arose
a
young
woman
sitting
among
the
singers
in
the
choir
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
face
and
throwing
back
her
head
rocked
back
and
forth
a
man
near
the
door
guffawed
loudly
and
went
hurriedly
out
all
over
the
church
people
began
laughing
sam
turned
his
eyes
upon
his
mother
she
was
staring
straight
ahead
of
her
and
her
face
was
red
i
m
going
out
of
this
place
and
i
m
never
coming
back
again
he
whispered
and
stepping
into
the
aisle
walked
boldly
toward
the
door
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
if
the
evangelist
tried
to
stop
him
he
would
fight
at
his
back
he
felt
the
rows
of
people
looking
at
him
and
smiling
the
laughter
continued
in
the
street
he
hurried
along
consumed
with
indignation
i
ll
never
go
into
any
church
again
he
swore
shaking
his
fist
in
the
air
the
public
avowals
he
had
heard
in
the
church
seemed
to
him
cheap
and
unworthy
he
wondered
why
his
mother
stayed
in
there
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
he
dismissed
all
the
people
in
the
church
it
is
a
place
to
make
public
asses
of
the
people
he
thought
sam
mcpherson
wandered
through
main
street
dreading
to
meet
valmore
and
john
telfer
finding
the
chairs
back
of
the
stove
in
wildman
s
grocery
deserted
he
hurried
past
the
grocer
and
hid
in
a
corner
tears
of
wrath
stood
in
his
eyes
he
had
been
made
a
fool
of
he
imagined
the
scene
that
would
go
on
when
he
came
upon
the
street
with
the
papers
the
next
morning
freedom
smith
would
be
there
sitting
in
the
old
worn
buggy
and
roaring
so
that
all
the
street
would
listen
and
laugh
going
to
lie
out
in
any
green
pastures
sam
he
would
shout
ain
t
you
afraid
you
ll
take
cold
by
geiger
s
drug
store
would
stand
valmore
and
telfer
eager
to
join
in
the
fun
at
his
expense
telfer
would
pound
on
the
side
of
the
building
with
his
cane
and
roar
with
laughter
valmore
would
make
a
trumpet
of
his
hands
and
shout
after
the
fleeing
boy
do
you
sleep
out
alone
in
them
green
pastures
freedom
smith
would
roar
again
sam
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
grocery
as
he
hurried
along
blind
with
wrath
he
felt
he
would
like
a
fight
with
some
one
and
then
hurrying
and
avoiding
the
people
he
merged
with
the
crowd
on
the
street
and
became
a
witness
to
the
strange
thing
that
happened
that
night
in
caxton
in
main
street
hushed
people
stood
about
in
groups
talking
the
air
was
heavy
with
excitement
solitary
figures
went
from
group
to
group
whispering
hoarsely
mike
mccarthy
the
man
who
had
denied
god
and
who
had
won
a
place
for
himself
in
the
affection
of
the
newsboy
had
assaulted
a
man
with
a
pocket
knife
and
had
left
him
bleeding
and
wounded
beside
a
country
road

big
and
sensational

happened
in
the
life
of
the
town

mccarthy
and
sam
were
friends
for
years
the
man
had
idled
upon
the
streets
of
the
town
loitering
about
boasting
and
talking
he
had
sat
for
hours
in
a
chair
under
a
tree
before
the
new
leland
house
reading
books
doing
tricks
with
cards
engaging
in
long
discussions
with

who
would
stand
up
to
him

into
trouble
in

at
the
edge
of

come
home
from
the
fields
to
find
his
wife
in
the
bold
irishman
s
arms
and
the
two
men
had
gone
out
of
the
house
together
to
fight
in
the
road
the
woman
weeping
in
the
house
followed
to
ask
forgiveness
of
her
husband
running
in
the
gathering
darkness
along
the
road
she
had
found
him
cut
and
bleeding
terribly
lying
in
a
ditch
under
a
hedge
on
down

ran
and
appeared
at

and
calling
for

story
of
the
fight
in
the
road
got
to
caxton
just
as
sam
came
out
of
the
corner
back
of
the
stove
in
wildman
s
and
appeared
on
the
street
men
ran
from
store
to
store
and
from
group
to
group
along
the
street
saying
that
the
young
farmer
had
died
and
that
murder
had
been
done
on
a
street
corner
windy
mcpherson
harangued
the
crowd
declaring
that
the
men
of
caxton
should
arise
in
the
defence
of
their
homes
and
string
the
murderer
to
a
lamp
post

shouted
when
several
men
coming
out
of

stopped
the
marshal

horse
saying
you
will
have
trouble
out

come
and
he
will
come
the
rest
of
that
lot
won

wrap
the
entire
mccarthy
family
around
his
there
were
six
of
the
mccarthy
men
all
except
mike
silent
sullen
men
who
only
talked
when
they
were
in
liquor
mike
furnished
the
town
s
social
touch
with
the
family
it
was
a
strange
family
to
live
there
in
that
fat
country
a
family
with
something
savage
and
primitive
about
it
one
that
belonged
among
western
mining
camps
or
among
the
half
savage
dwellers
in
deep
alleys
in
cities
and
the
fact
that
it
lived
on
a
corn
farm
in
iowa
was
in
the
words
of
john
telfer
something
monstrous
in
the
mccarthy
farm
lying
some
four
miles
east
of
caxton
had
once
contained
a
thousand
acres
of
good
land
lem
mccarthy
the
father
of
the
family
had
inherited
it
from
a
brother
a
gold
miner
a
a
sport
owning
fast
horses
who
planned
to
breed
race
horses
on
the
iowa
land
lem
had
come
out
of
the
back
streets
of
an
eastern
city
bringing
his
brood
of
tall
silent
savage
boys
to
live
upon
the
land
and
like
the
to
be
a
sport
thinking
the
wealth
that
had
come
to
him
vast
beyond
spending
he
had
plunged
into
horse
racing
and
gambling
when
within
two
years
five
hundred
acres
of
the
farm
had
to
be
sold
to
pay
gambling
debts
and
the
wide
acres
lay
covered
with
weeds
lem
became
alarmed
and
settled
down
to
hard
work
the
boys
working
all
day
in
the
field
and
at
long
intervals
coming
into
town
at
night
to
get
into
trouble
having
no
mother
or
sister
and
knowing
that
no
caxton
woman
could
be
hired
to
go
upon
the
place
they
did
their
own
housework
and
on
rainy
days
sat
about
the
old
farmhouse
playing
cards
and
fighting
on
other
days
they
would
stand
around
the
bar
in
art
sherman
s
saloon
in
piety
hollow
drinking
until
they
had
lost
their
savage
silence
and
had
become
loud
and
quarrelsome
going
from
there
upon
the
streets
to
seek
trouble
once
going
into
hayner
s
restaurant
they
took
stacks
of
plates
from
shelves
back
of
the
counter
and
standing
in
the
doorway
threw
them
at
people
passing
in
the
street
the
crash
of
the
breaking
crockery
accompanying
their
roaring
laughter
when
they
had
driven
the
people
to
cover
they
got
upon
their
horses
and
with
wild
shouts
raced
up
and
down
main
street
between
the
rows
of
tied
horses
until
hop
higgins
the
town
marshal
appeared
when
they
rode
off
into
the
country
awakening
the
farmers
along
the
darkened
road
as
they
fled
shouting
and
singing
toward
home
when
the
mccarthy
boys
got
into
trouble
in
caxton
old
lem
mccarthy
drove
into
town
and
got
them
out
of
it
paying
for
the
damage
done
and
going
about
declaring
the
boys
meant
no
harm
when
told
to
keep
them
out
of
town
he
shook
his
head
and
said
he
would
try
mike
mccarthy
did
not
ride
swearing
and
singing
with
the
five
brothers
along
the
dark
road
he
did
not
work
all
day
in
the
hot
corn
fields
he
was
the
family
gentleman
and
wearing
good
clothes
strolled
instead
upon
the
street
or
loitered
in
the
shade
before
the
new
leland
house
mike
had
been
educated
for
some
years
he
had
attended
a
college
in
indiana
from
which
he
was
expelled
for
an
affair
with
a
woman
after
his
return
from
college
he
stayed
in
caxton
living
at
the
hotel
and
making
a
pretence
of
studying
law
in
the
office
of
old
judge
reynolds
he
paid
slight
attention
to
the
study
of
law
but
with
infinite
patience
had
so
trained
his
hands
that
he
became
wonderfully
dexterous
with
coins
and
cards
plucking
them
out
of
the
air
and
making
them
appear
in
the
shoes
the
hats
and
even
in
the
mouths
of
bystanders
during
the
day
he
walked
the
streets
looking
at
the
girl
clerks
in
the
stores
or
stood
upon
the
station
platform
waving
his
hand
to
women
passengers
on
passing
trains
he
told
john
telfer
that
the
flattery
of
women
was
a
lost
art
that
he
intended
to
restore
mike
mccarthy
carried
in
his
pockets
books
which
he
read
sitting
in
a
chair
before
the
hotel
or
on
the
stones
before
store
windows
when
on
saturdays
the
streets
were
filled
with
people
he
stood
on
the
corners
giving
gratuitous
performances
of
his
magical
art
with
cards
and
coins
and
eyeing
country
girls
in
the
crowd
once
a
woman
the
town
stationer
s
wife
shouted
at
him
calling
him
a
lazy
lout
whereupon
he
threw
a
coin
in
the
air
and
when
it
did
not
come
down
rushed
toward
her
shouting
she
has
it
in
her
when
the
stationer
s
wife
ran
into
her
shop
and
banged
the
door
the
crowd
laughed
and
shouted
with
delight
telfer
had
a
liking
for
the
tall
loitering
mccarthy
and
sometimes
sat
with
him
discussing
a
novel
or
a
poem
sam
in
the
background
listened
eagerly
valmore
did
not
care
for
the
man
shaking
his
head
and
declaring
that
such
a
fellow
could
come
to
no
good
end
the
rest
of
the
town
agreed
with
valmore
and
mccarthy
knowing
this
sunned
himself
in
the
town
s
displeasure
for
the
sake
of
the
public
furor
it
brought
down
upon
his
head
he
proclaimed
himself
a
socialist
an
anarchist
an
atheist
a
pagan
among
all
the
mccarthy
boys
he
alone
cared
greatly
about
women
and
he
made
public
and
open
declarations
of
his
passion
for
them
before
the
men
gathered
about
the
stove
in
wildman
s
grocery
store
he
would
stand
whipping
them
into
a
frenzy
by
declaring
for
free
love
and
vowing
that
he
would
have
the
best
of
any
woman
who
gave
him
the
chance
for
this
man
the
frugal
hard
working
newsboy
had
conceived
a
regard
amounting
to
a
passion
as
he
listened
to
mccarthy
he
got
continuous
delightful
little
thrills
there
is
nothing
he
would
not
dare
thought
the
boy
he
is
the
freest
the
boldest
the
bravest
man
in
when
the
young
irishman
seeing
the
admiration
in
his
eyes
flung
him
a
silver
dollar
saying
that
is
for
your
fine
brown
eyes
my
boy
it
i
had
them
i
would
have
half
the
women
in
town
after
me
sam
kept
the
dollar
in
his
pocket
and
counted
it
a
kind
of
treasure
like
the
rose
given
a
lover
by
his
sweetheart
it
was
past
eleven
o
clock
when
hop
higgins
returned
to
town
with
mccarthy
driving
quietly
along
the
street
and
through
an
alley
at
the
back
of
the
town
hall
the
crowd
upon
the
street
had
broken
up
sam
had
gone
from
one
to
another
of
the
muttering
groups
his
heart
quaking
with
fear
now
he
stood
at
the
back
of
the
mass
of
men
gathered
at
the
jail
door
an
oil
lamp
burning
at
the
top
of
the
post
above
the
door
threw
dancing
flickering
lights
on
the
faces
of
the
men
before
him
the
thunder
storm
that
had
threatened
had
not
come
but
the
unnatural
warm
wind
continued
and
the
sky
overhead
was
inky
black
through
the
alley
to
the
jail
door
drove
the
town
marshal
the
young
mccarthy
sitting
in
the
buggy
beside
him
a
man
rushed
forward
to
hold
the
horse
mccarthy
s
face
was
chalky
white
he
laughed
and
shouted
raising
his
hand
toward
the
sky
i
am
michael
son
of
god
i
have
cut
a
man
with
a
knife
so
that
his
red
blood
ran
upon
the
ground
i
am
the
son
of
god
and
this
filthy
jail
shall
be
my
sanctuary
in
there
i
shall
talk
aloud
with
my
father
he
roared
hoarsely
shaking
his
fist
at
the
crowd
sons
of
this
cesspool
of
respectability
stay
and
hear
send
for
your
females
and
let
them
stand
in
the
presence
of
a
man
taking
the
white
man
by
the
arm
marshal
higgins
led
him
into
the
jail
the
clank
of
locks
the
low
murmur
of
the
voice
of
higgins
and
the
wild
laughter
of
mccarthy
floating
out
to
the
group
of
silent
men
standing
in
the
mud
of
the
alley
sam
mcpherson
ran
past
the
group
of
men
to
the
side
of
the
jail
and
finding
john
telfer
and
valmore
leaning
silently
against
the
wall
of
tom
folger
s
wagon
shop
slipped
between
them
telfer
put
out
his
arm
and
laid
it
upon
the
boy
s
shoulder
hop
higgins
coming
out
of
the
jail
addressed
the
crowd
don
t
answer
if
he
talks
he
said
he
is
as
crazy
as
a
sam
moved
closer
to
telfer
the
voice
of
the
imprisoned
man
loud
and
filled
with
a
startling
boldness
rolled
out
of
the
jail
he
began
praying
hear
me
father
almighty
who
has
permitted
this
town
of
caxton
to
exist
and
has
let
me
thy
son
grow
to
manhood
i
am
michael
thy
son
they
have
put
me
in
this
jail
where
rats
run
across
the
floor
and
they
stand
in
the
mud
outside
as
i
talk
with
thee
are
you
there
old
truepenny
a
breath
of
cold
air
blew
up
the
alley
followed
by
a
flaw
of
rain
the
group
under
the
flickering
lamp
by
the
jail
entrance
drew
back
against
the
walls
of
the
building
sam
could
see
them
dimly
pressing
closely
against
the
wall
the
man
in
the
jail
laughed
loudly
i
have
had
a
philosophy
of
life
o
father
he
shouted
i
have
seen
men
and
women
here
living
year
after
year
without
children
i
have
seen
them
hoarding
pennies
and
denying
thee
new
life
on
which
to
work
thy
will
to
these
women
i
have
gone
secretly
talking
of
carnal
love
with
them
i
have
been
gentle
and
kind
them
i
have
a
roaring
laugh
broke
from
the
lips
of
the
imprisoned
man
are
you
there
oh
dwellers
in
the
cesspool
of
respectability
he
shouted
do
you
stand
in
the
mud
with
cold
feet
listening
i
have
been
with
your
wives
eleven
caxton
wives
without
babes
have
i
been
with
and
it
has
been
fruitless
the
twelfth
woman
i
have
just
left
leaving
her
man
in
the
road
a
bleeding
sacrifice
to
thee
i
shall
call
out
the
names
of
the
eleven
i
shall
have
revenge
also
upon
the
husbands
of
the
women
some
of
whom
wait
with
the
others
in
the
mud
he
began
calling
off
the
names
of
caxton
wives
a
shudder
ran
through
the
body
of
the
boy
sensitised
by
the
new
chill
in
the
air
and
by
the
excitement
of
the
night
among
the
men
standing
along
the
wall
of
the
jail
a
murmur
arose
again
they
grouped
themselves
under
the
flickering
light
by
the
jail
door
disregarding
the
rain
valmore
stumbling
out
of
the
darkness
beside
sam
stood
before
telfer
the
boy
should
be
going
home
he
said
this
isn
t
fit
for
him
to
telfer
laughed
and
drew
sam
closer
to
him
he
has
heard
enough
lies
in
this
town
he
said
truth
won
t
hurt
him
i
would
not
go
myself
nor
would
you
and
the
boy
shall
not
go
this
mccarthy
has
a
brain
although
he
is
half
insane
now
he
is
trying
to
work
something
out
the
boy
and
i
will
stay
to
the
voice
from
the
jail
continued
calling
out
the
names
of
caxton
wives
voices
in
the
group
before
the
jail
door
began
shouting
this
should
be
stopped
let
us
tear
down
the
mccarthy
laughed
aloud
they
squirm
oh
father
they
squirm
i
have
them
in
the
pit
and
i
torture
them
he
cried
an
ugly
feeling
of
satisfaction
came
over
sam
he
had
a
sense
of
the
fact
that
the
names
shouted
from
the
jail
would
be
repeated
over
and
over
through
the
town
one
of
the
women
whose
names
had
been
called
out
had
stood
with
the
evangelist
at
the
back
of
the
church
trying
to
induce
the
wife
of
the
baker
to
rise
and
be
counted
in
the
fold
with
the
lambs
the
rain
falling
on
the
shoulders
of
the
men
by
the
jail
door
changed
to
hail
the
air
grew
colder
and
the
hailstones
rattled
on
the
roofs
of
buildings
some
of
the
men
joined
telfer
and
valmore
talking
in
low
excited
voices
and
mary
mckane
too
the
hypocrite
sam
heard
one
of
them
say
the
voice
inside
the
jail
changed
still
praying
mike
mccarthy
seemed
also
to
be
talking
to
the
group
in
the
darkness
outside
i
am
sick
of
my
life
i
have
sought
leadership
and
have
not
found
it
oh
father
send
down
to
men
a
new
christ
one
to
get
hold
of
us
a
modern
christ
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
who
will
swear
and
knock
us
about
so
that
we
vermin
who
pretend
to
be
made
in
thy
image
will
understand
let
him
go
into
churches
and
into
courthouses
into
cities
and
into
towns
like
this
shouting
be
ashamed
be
ashamed
of
your
cowardly
concern
over
your
snivelling
souls
let
him
tell
us
that
never
will
our
lives
so
miserably
lived
be
repeated
after
our
bodies
lie
rotting
in
the
a
sob
broke
from
his
lips
and
a
lump
came
into
sam
s
throat
oh
father
help
us
men
of
caxton
to
understand
that
we
have
only
this
our
lives
this
life
so
warm
and
hopeful
and
laughing
in
the
sun
this
life
with
its
awkward
boys
full
of
strange
possibilities
and
its
girls
with
their
long
legs
and
freckles
on
their
noses
that
are
meant
to
carry
life
within
themselves
new
life
kicking
and
stirring
and
waking
them
at
the
voice
of
the
prayer
broke
wild
sobs
took
the
place
of
speech
father
shouted
the
broken
voice
i
have
taken
a
life
a
man
that
moved
and
talked
and
whistled
in
the
sunshine
on
winter
mornings
i
have
the
voice
inside
the
jail
became
inaudible
silence
broken
by
low
sobs
from
the
jail
fell
on
the
little
dark
alley
and
the
listening
men
began
going
silently
away
the
lump
in
sam
s
throat
grew
larger
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
he
went
with
telfer
and
valmore
out
of
the
alley
and
into
the
street
the
two
men
walking
in
silence
the
rain
had
ceased
and
a
cold
wind
blew
the
boy
felt
that
he
had
been
shriven
his
mind
his
heart
even
his
tired
body
seemed
strangely
cleansed
he
felt
a
new
affection
for
telfer
and
valmore
when
telfer
began
talking
he
listened
eagerly
thinking
that
at
last
he
understood
him
and
knew
why
men
like
valmore
wildman
freedom
smith
and
telfer
loved
each
other
and
went
on
being
friends
year
after
year
in
the
face
of
difficulties
and
misunderstandings
he
thought
that
he
had
got
hold
of
the
idea
of
brotherhood
that
john
telfer
talked
of
so
often
and
so
eloquently
mike
mccarthy
is
only
a
brother
who
has
gone
the
dark
road
he
thought
and
felt
a
glow
of
pride
in
the
thought
and
in
the
apt
expression
of
it
in
his
mind
john
telfer
forgetting
the
boy
talked
soberly
to
valmore
the
two
men
stumbling
along
in
the
darkness
intent
upon
their
own
thoughts
it
is
an
odd
thought
said
telfer
and
his
voice
seemed
far
away
and
unnatural
like
the
voice
from
the
jail
it
is
an
odd
thought
that
but
for
a
quirk
in
the
brain
this
mike
mccarthy
might
himself
have
been
a
kind
of
christ
with
a
pipe
in
his
valmore
stumbled
and
half
fell
in
the
darkness
at
a
street
crossing
telfer
went
on
talking
the
world
will
some
day
grope
its
way
into
some
kind
of
an
understanding
of
its
extraordinary
men
now
they
suffer
terribly
in
success
or
in
such
failures
as
has
come
to
this
imaginative
strangely
perverted
irishman
their
lot
is
pitiful
it
is
only
the
common
the
plain
unthinking
man
who
slides
peacefully
through
this
troubled
at
the
house
jane
mcpherson
sat
waiting
for
her
boy
she
was
thinking
of
the
scene
in
the
church
and
a
hard
light
was
in
her
eyes
sam
went
past
the
sleeping
room
of
his
parents
where
windy
mcpherson
snored
peacefully
and
up
the
stairway
to
his
own
room
he
undressed
and
putting
out
the
light
knelt
upon
the
floor
from
the
wild
ravings
of
the
man
in
the
jail
he
had
got
hold
of
something
in
the
midst
of
the
blasphemy
of
mike
mccarthy
he
had
sensed
a
deep
and
abiding
love
of
life
where
the
church
had
failed
the
bold
sensualist
succeeded
sam
felt
that
he
could
have
prayed
in
the
presence
of
the
entire
town
oh
father
he
cried
sending
up
his
voice
in
the
silence
of
the
little
room
make
me
stick
to
the
thought
that
the
right
living
of
this
my
life
is
my
duty
to
by
the
door
below
while
valmore
waited
on
the
sidewalk
telfer
talked
to
jane
mcpherson
i
wanted
sam
to
hear
he
explained
he
needs
a
religion
all
young
men
need
a
religion
i
wanted
him
to
hear
how
even
a
man
like
mike
mccarthy
keeps
instinctively
trying
to
justify
himself
before
chapter
iv
john
telfer
s
friendship
was
a
formative
influence
upon
sam
mcpherson
his
father
s
worthlessness
and
the
growing
realisation
of
the
hardship
of
his
mother
s
position
had
given
life
a
bitter
taste
in
his
mouth
and
telfer
sweetened
it
he
entered
with
zeal
into
sam
s
thoughts
and
dreams
and
tried
valiantly
to
arouse
in
the
quiet
industrious
boy
some
of
his
own
love
of
life
and
beauty
at
night
as
the
two
walked
down
country
roads
the
man
would
stop
and
waving
his
arms
about
quote
poe
or
browning
or
in
another
mood
would
compel
sam
s
attention
to
the
rare
smell
of
a
hayfield
or
to
a
moonlit
stretch
of
meadow
before
people
gathered
on
the
streets
he
teased
the
boy
calling
him
a
little
money
grubber
and
saying
he
is
like
a
little
mole
that
works
underground
as
the
mole
goes
for
a
worm
so
this
boy
goes
for
a
piece
i
have
watched
him
a
travelling
man
goes
out
of
town
leaving
a
stray
dime
or
nickel
here
and
within
an
hour
it
is
in
this
boy
s
pocket
i
have
talked
to
banker
walker
of
him
he
trembles
lest
his
vaults
become
too
small
to
hold
the
wealth
of
this
young
croesus
the
day
will
come
when
he
will
buy
the
town
and
put
it
into
his
vest
for
all
his
public
teasing
of
the
boy
telfer
had
the
genius
to
adopt
a
different
attitude
when
they
were
alone
together
then
he
talked
to
him
openly
and
freely
as
he
talked
to
valmore
and
freedom
smith
and
to
other
cronies
of
his
on
the
streets
of
caxton
walking
along
the
road
he
would
point
with
his
cane
to
the
town
and
say
you
and
that
mother
of
yours
have
more
of
the
real
stuff
in
you
than
the
rest
of
the
boys
and
mothers
of
the
town
put
in
all
caxton
telfer
was
the
only
man
who
knew
books
and
who
took
them
seriously
sam
sometimes
found
his
attitude
toward
them
puzzling
and
would
stand
with
open
mouth
listening
as
telfer
swore
or
laughed
at
a
book
as
he
did
at
valmore
or
freedom
smith
he
had
a
fine
portrait
of
browning
which
he
kept
hung
in
the
stable
and
before
this
he
would
stand
his
legs
spread
apart
and
his
head
tilted
to
one
side
talking
a
rich
old
sport
you
are
eh
he
would
say
grinning
getting
yourself
discussed
by
women
and
college
professors
in
clubs
eh
you
old
fraud
toward
mary
underwood
the
school
teacher
who
had
become
sam
s
friend
and
with
whom
the
boy
sometimes
walked
and
talked
telfer
had
no
charity
mary
underwood
was
a
sort
of
cinder
in
the
eyes
of
caxton
she
was
the
only
child
of
silas
underwood
the
town
harness
maker
who
once
had
worked
in
a
shop
belonging
to
windy
mcpherson
after
the
business
failure
of
windy
he
had
started
independently
and
for
a
time
did
well
sending
his
daughter
to
a
school
in
massachusetts
mary
did
not
understand
the
people
of
caxton
and
the
people
misunderstood
and
distrusted
her
taking
no
part
in
the
life
of
the
town
and
keeping
to
herself
and
to
her
books
she
awoke
a
kind
of
fear
in
others
because
she
did
not
join
them
at
church
suppers
or
go
from
porch
to
porch
gossiping
with
other
women
through
the
long
summer
evenings
they
thought
her
something
abnormal
on
sundays
she
sat
alone
in
her
pew
at
church
and
on
saturday
afternoons
come
storm
come
sunshine
she
walked
on
country
roads
and
through
the
woods
accompanied
by
a
collie
dog
she
was
a
small
woman
with
a
straight
slender
figure
and
had
fine
blue
eyes
filled
with
changing
lights
hidden
by
the
she
almost
constantly
wore
her
lips
were
very
full
and
red
and
she
sat
with
them
parted
so
that
the
edges
of
her
fine
teeth
showed
her
nose
was
large
and
a
fine
colour
glowed
in
her
cheeks
though
different
she
had
like
jane
mcpherson
a
habit
of
silence
and
under
her
silence
she
like
sam
s
mother
possessed
an
unusually
strong
and
vigorous
mind
as
a
child
she
was
a
sort
of
half
invalid
and
had
not
been
on
friendly
footing
with
other
children
it
was
then
that
her
habit
of
silence
and
reticence
had
been
established
the
years
in
the
school
in
massachusetts
restored
her
health
but
did
not
break
this
habit
she
came
home
and
took
the
place
in
the
schools
to
earn
money
with
which
to
take
her
back
east
dreaming
of
a
position
as
instructor
in
an
eastern
college
she
was
that
rare
thing
a
woman
scholar
loving
scholarship
for
its
own
sake
mary
underwood
s
position
in
the
town
and
in
the
schools
was
insecure
out
of
her
silent
independent
way
of
life
had
sprung
a
misunderstanding
that
at
least
once
had
taken
definite
form
and
had
come
near
driving
her
from
the
town
and
schools
that
she
did
not
succumb
to
the
storm
of
criticism
that
for
some
weeks
beat
about
her
head
was
due
to
her
habit
of
silence
and
to
a
determination
to
get
her
own
way
in
the
face
of
everything
it
was
a
suggestion
of
scandal
that
had
put
the
grey
hairs
upon
her
head
the
scandal
had
blown
over
before
the
time
of
her
friendship
for
sam
but
he
had
known
of
it
in
those
days
he
knew
of
everything
that
went
on
in
the
town
his
quick
ears
and
eyes
missed
nothing
more
than
once
he
had
heard
the
men
waiting
to
be
shaved
in
sawyer
s
barber
shop
speak
of
her
the
tale
ran
that
she
had
been
involved
in
an
affair
with
a
real
estate
agent
who
had
afterward
left
town
it
was
said
that
the
man
a
tall
fellow
had
been
in
love
with
mary
and
had
wanted
to
desert
his
wife
and
go
away
with
her
one
night
he
had
driven
to
mary
s
house
in
a
closed
buggy
and
the
two
had
driven
into
the
country
they
had
sat
for
hours
in
the
covered
buggy
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
talked
and
people
driving
past
had
seen
them
there
talking
together
and
then
she
had
got
out
of
the
buggy
and
walked
home
alone
through
snow
drifts
the
next
day
she
was
at
school
as
usual
when
told
of
it
the
school
superintendent
a
puttering
old
fellow
with
vacant
eyes
had
shaken
his
head
in
alarm
and
declared
that
it
must
be
looked
into
he
called
mary
into
his
little
narrow
office
in
the
school
building
but
lost
courage
when
she
sat
before
him
and
said
nothing
the
man
in
the
barber
shop
who
repeated
the
tale
said
that
the
real
estate
man
drove
on
to
a
distant
station
and
took
a
train
to
the
city
and
that
some
days
later
he
came
back
to
caxton
and
moved
his
family
out
of
town
sam
dismissed
the
story
from
his
mind
having
begun
a
friendship
for
mary
he
put
the
man
in
the
barber
shop
into
a
class
with
windy
mcpherson
and
thought
of
him
as
a
pretender
and
liar
who
talked
for
the
sake
of
talk
he
remembered
with
a
shock
the
crude
levity
with
which
the
loafers
in
the
shop
had
greeted
the
repetition
of
the
tale
their
comments
had
come
back
to
his
mind
as
he
walked
through
the
streets
with
his
newspapers
and
had
given
him
a
kind
of
jolt
he
went
along
under
the
trees
thinking
of
the
sunlight
falling
upon
the
grey
hair
as
they
walked
together
on
summer
afternoons
and
bit
his
lip
and
opened
and
closed
his
fist
convulsively
during
mary
s
second
year
in
the
caxton
schools
her
mother
died
and
at
the
end
of
another
year
her
father
failing
in
the
harness
business
mary
became
a
fixture
in
the
schools
the
house
at
the
edge
of
the
town
the
property
of
her
mother
had
come
down
to
her
and
she
lived
there
with
an
old
aunt
after
the
passing
of
the
wind
of
scandal
concerning
the
real
estate
man
the
town
lost
interest
in
her
she
was
at
the
time
of
her
first
friendship
with
sam
and
lived
alone
among
her
books
sam
had
been
deeply
moved
by
her
friendship
it
had
seemed
to
him
something
significant
that
grown
people
with
affairs
of
their
own
should
be
so
in
earnest
about
his
future
as
she
and
telfer
were
boylike
he
counted
it
a
tribute
to
himself
rather
than
to
the
winsome
youth
in
him
and
was
made
proud
by
it
having
no
real
feeling
for
books
and
only
pretending
to
have
out
of
a
desire
to
please
he
sometimes
went
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
two
friends
passing
off
their
opinions
as
his
own
at
this
trick
telfer
invariably
caught
him
that
is
not
your
notion
he
would
shout
you
have
it
from
that
school
teacher
it
is
the
opinion
of
a
woman
their
opinions
like
the
books
they
sometimes
write
are
founded
on
nothing
they
are
not
the
real
things
women
know
nothing
men
only
care
for
them
because
they
have
not
had
what
they
want
from
them
no
woman
is
really
big
except
maybe
my
woman
when
sam
continued
to
be
much
in
the
company
of
mary
telfer
grew
more
bitter
i
would
have
you
observe
women
s
minds
and
avoid
letting
them
influence
your
own
he
told
the
boy
they
live
in
a
world
of
unrealities
they
like
even
vulgar
people
in
books
but
shrink
from
the
simple
earthy
folk
about
them
that
school
teacher
is
so
is
she
like
me
does
she
while
loving
books
love
also
the
very
smell
of
human
life
in
a
way
telfer
s
attitude
toward
the
kindly
little
school
teacher
became
sam
s
attitude
although
they
walked
and
talked
together
the
course
of
study
she
had
planned
for
him
he
never
took
up
and
as
he
grew
to
know
her
better
the
books
she
read
and
the
ideas
she
advanced
appealed
to
him
less
and
less
he
thought
that
she
as
telfer
held
lived
in
a
world
of
illusion
and
unreality
and
said
so
when
she
lent
him
books
he
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
did
not
read
them
when
he
did
read
he
thought
the
books
reminded
him
of
something
that
hurt
him
they
were
in
some
way
false
and
pretentious
he
thought
they
were
like
his
father
one
day
he
tried
reading
aloud
to
telfer
from
a
book
mary
underwood
had
lent
him
the
story
was
one
of
a
poetic
man
with
long
unclean
fingernails
who
went
among
people
preaching
the
doctrine
of
beauty
it
began
with
a
scene
on
a
hillside
in
a
rainstorm
where
the
poetic
man
sat
under
a
tent
writing
a
letter
to
his
sweetheart
telfer
was
beside
himself
jumping
from
his
seat
under
a
tree
by
the
roadside
he
waved
his
arms
and
shouted
stop
stop
it
do
not
go
on
with
it
the
story
lies
a
man
could
not
write
love
letters
under
the
circumstances
and
he
was
a
fool
to
pitch
his
tent
on
a
hillside
a
man
in
a
tent
on
a
hillside
in
a
storm
would
be
cold
and
wet
and
getting
the
rheumatism
to
be
writing
letters
he
would
need
to
be
an
unspeakable
ass
he
had
better
be
out
digging
a
trench
to
keep
the
water
from
running
through
his
waving
his
arms
telfer
went
off
up
the
road
and
sam
followed
thinking
him
altogether
right
and
if
later
in
life
he
learned
that
there
are
men
who
could
write
love
letters
on
a
piece
of
housetop
in
a
flood
he
did
not
know
it
then
and
the
least
suggestion
of
windiness
or
pretence
lay
heavy
in
his
stomach
telfer
had
a
vast
enthusiasm
for
bellamy
s
looking
backward
and
read
it
aloud
to
his
wife
on
sunday
afternoons
sitting
under
the
apple
trees
in
the
garden
they
had
a
fund
of
little
personal
jokes
and
sayings
that
they
were
forever
laughing
over
and
she
had
infinite
delight
in
his
comments
on
the
life
and
people
of
caxton
but
did
not
share
his
love
of
books
when
she
sometimes
went
to
sleep
in
her
chair
during
the
sunday
afternoon
readings
he
poked
her
with
his
cane
and
laughingly
told
her
to
wake
up
and
listen
to
the
dream
of
a
great
dreamer
among
browning
s
verses
his
favourites
were
a
light
woman
and
fra
lippo
lippi
and
he
would
recite
these
aloud
with
great
gusto
he
declared
mark
twain
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
and
in
certain
moods
he
would
walk
the
road
beside
sam
reciting
over
and
over
one
or
two
lines
of
verse
often
this
from
poe
helen
thy
beauty
is
to
me
like
some
nicean
bark
of
yore
then
stopping
and
turning
upon
the
boy
he
would
demand
whether
or
not
the
writing
of
such
lines
wasn
t
worth
living
a
life
for
telfer
had
a
pack
of
dogs
that
always
went
with
them
on
their
walks
at
night
and
he
had
for
them
long
latin
names
that
sam
could
never
remember
one
summer
be
bought
a
trotting
mare
from
lem
mccarthy
and
gave
great
attention
to
the
colt
which
he
named
bellamy
boy
trotting
him
up
and
down
a
little
driveway
by
the
side
of
his
house
for
hours
at
a
time
and
declaring
he
would
be
a
great
trotting
horse
he
could
recite
the
colt
s
pedigree
with
great
gusto
and
when
he
had
been
talking
to
sam
of
some
book
he
would
repay
the
boy
s
attention
by
saying
you
my
boy
are
as
far
superior
to
the
run
of
boys
about
town
as
the
colt
bellamy
boy
is
superior
to
the
farm
horses
that
are
hitched
along
main
street
on
saturday
and
then
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
a
look
of
much
seriousness
on
his
face
he
would
add
and
for
the
same
reason
you
have
been
like
him
under
a
master
trainer
of
one
evening
sam
now
grown
to
man
s
stature
and
full
of
the
awkwardness
and
of
his
new
growth
was
sitting
on
a
cracker
barrel
at
the
back
of
wildman
s
grocery
it
was
a
summer
evening
and
a
breeze
blew
through
the
open
doors
swaying
the
hanging
oil
lamps
that
burned
and
sputtered
overhead
as
usual
he
was
listening
in
silence
to
the
talk
that
went
on
among
the
men
standing
with
legs
wide
apart
and
from
time
to
time
jabbing
with
his
cane
at
sam
s
legs
john
telfer
held
forth
on
the
subject
of
love
it
is
a
theme
that
poets
do
well
to
write
of
he
declared
in
writing
of
it
they
avoid
the
necessity
of
embracing
it
in
trying
for
a
line
they
forget
to
look
at
ankles
he
who
sings
most
passionately
of
love
has
been
in
love
the
least
he
woos
the
goddess
of
poesy
and
only
gets
into
trouble
when
he
like
john
keats
turns
to
the
daughter
of
a
villager
and
tries
to
live
the
lines
he
has
stuff
and
nonsense
roared
freedom
smith
who
had
been
sitting
tilted
far
back
in
a
chair
with
his
feet
against
the
cold
stove
smoking
a
short
black
pipe
and
who
now
brought
his
feet
down
upon
the
floor
with
a
bang
admiring
telfer
s
flow
of
words
he
pretended
to
be
filled
with
scorn
the
night
is
too
hot
for
eloquence
he
bellowed
if
you
must
be
eloquent
talk
of
ice
cream
or
mint
juleps
or
recite
a
verse
about
the
old
swimming
telfer
wetting
his
finger
thrust
it
into
the
air
the
wind
is
in
the
the
beasts
roar
we
will
have
a
storm
he
said
winking
at
valmore
banker
walker
came
into
the
store
followed
by
his
daughter
she
was
a
small
girl
with
black
quick
eyes
seeing
sam
sitting
with
swinging
legs
upon
the
cracker
barrel
she
spoke
to
her
father
and
went
out
of
the
store
at
the
sidewalk
she
stopped
and
turning
made
a
quick
motion
with
her
hand
sam
jumped
off
the
cracker
barrel
and
strolled
toward
the
street
door
a
flush
was
on
his
cheeks
his
mouth
felt
hot
and
dry
he
went
with
extreme
deliberateness
stopping
to
bow
to
the
banker
and
for
a
moment
lingering
to
read
a
newspaper
that
lay
upon
the
cigar
case
to
avoid
the
comments
he
feared
his
going
might
excite
among
the
men
by
the
stove
in
his
heart
he
trembled
lest
the
girl
should
have
disappeared
down
the
street
and
with
his
eyes
he
looked
guiltily
at
the
banker
who
had
joined
the
group
at
the
back
of
the
store
and
who
now
stood
listening
to
the
talk
while
he
read
from
a
list
held
in
his
hand
and
wildman
went
here
and
there
doing
up
packages
and
repeating
aloud
the
names
of
articles
called
off
by
the
banker
at
the
end
of
the
lighted
business
section
of
main
street
sam
found
the
girl
waiting
for
him
she
began
to
tell
of
the
subterfuge
by
which
she
had
escaped
her
father
i
told
him
i
would
go
home
with
my
sister
she
said
tossing
her
head
taking
hold
of
the
boy
s
hand
she
led
him
along
the
shaded
street
for
the
first
time
sam
walked
in
the
company
of
one
of
the
strange
beings
that
had
begun
to
bring
him
uneasy
nights
and
overcome
with
the
wonder
of
it
the
blood
climbed
through
his
body
and
made
his
head
reel
so
that
he
walked
in
silence
unable
to
understand
his
own
emotions
he
felt
the
soft
hand
of
the
girl
with
delight
his
heart
pounded
against
the
walls
of
his
chest
and
a
choking
sensation
gripped
at
his
throat
walking
along
the
street
past
lighted
residences
where
the
low
voices
of
women
in
talk
greeted
his
ears
sam
was
inordinately
proud
he
thought
that
he
should
like
to
turn
and
walk
with
this
girl
through
the
lighted
main
street
had
she
not
chosen
him
from
among
all
the
boys
of
the
town
had
she
not
with
a
flutter
of
her
little
white
hand
called
to
him
with
a
call
that
he
wondered
the
men
upon
the
cracker
barrels
had
not
heard
her
boldness
and
his
own
took
his
breath
away
he
could
not
talk
his
tongue
seemed
paralysed
down
the
street
went
the
boy
and
girl
loitering
in
the
shadows
hurrying
past
the
dim
oil
lamps
at
street
crossings
getting
from
each
other
wave
after
wave
of
exquisite
little
thrills
neither
spoke
they
were
beyond
words
had
they
not
together
done
this
daring
thing
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
they
stopped
and
stood
facing
each
other
the
girl
looked
at
the
ground
and
stood
facing
the
boy
putting
out
his
hand
he
laid
it
upon
her
shoulder
in
the
darkness
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
a
man
stumbled
homeward
along
a
board
sidewalk
the
lights
of
main
street
glowed
in
the
distance
sam
drew
the
girl
toward
him
she
raised
her
head
their
lips
met
and
then
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
kissed
him
again
and
again
eagerly
sam
s
return
to
wildman
s
was
marked
by
extreme
caution
although
he
had
been
absent
but
fifteen
minutes
it
seemed
to
him
that
hours
must
have
passed
and
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
the
stores
locked
and
darkness
settled
down
on
main
street
it
was
inconceivable
that
the
grocer
could
still
be
wrapping
packages
for
banker
walker
worlds
had
been
remade
manhood
had
come
to
him
why
the
man
should
have
wrapped
the
entire
store
package
after
package
and
sent
it
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
he
lingered
in
the
shadows
at
the
first
of
the
store
lights
where
ages
before
he
had
gone
a
mere
boy
to
meet
her
a
mere
girl
and
looked
with
wonder
at
the
lighted
way
before
him
sam
crossed
the
street
and
from
the
front
of
sawyer
s
barber
shop
looked
into
wildman
s
he
felt
like
a
spy
looking
into
the
camp
of
an
enemy
there
before
him
sat
the
men
into
whose
midst
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
cast
a
thunderbolt
he
might
walk
to
the
door
and
say
truthfully
enough
here
before
you
is
a
boy
that
by
the
flutter
of
a
white
hand
has
been
made
into
a
man
here
is
one
who
has
wrung
the
heart
of
womankind
and
eaten
his
fill
at
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
in
the
grocery
the
talk
still
continued
among
the
men
upon
the
cracker
barrels
who
seemed
unconscious
of
the
boy
s
slinking
entrance
indeed
their
talk
had
sunk
from
talking
of
love
and
of
poets
they
talked
of
corn
and
of
steers
banker
walker
his
packages
of
groceries
lying
on
the
counter
smoked
a
cigar
you
can
fairly
hear
the
corn
growing
he
said
it
wants
but
another
shower
or
two
and
we
shall
have
a
record
crop
i
plan
to
feed
a
hundred
steers
at
my
farm
out
rabbit
road
this
the
boy
climbed
again
upon
a
cracker
barrel
and
tried
to
look
unconcerned
and
interested
in
the
talk
still
his
heart
thumped
still
a
throbbing
went
on
in
his
wrists
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
floor
hoping
his
agitation
would
pass
unnoticed
the
banker
taking
up
the
packages
walked
out
at
the
door
valmore
and
freedom
smith
went
over
to
the
livery
barn
for
a
game
of
pinochle
and
john

twirling
his
cane
and
calling
to
a
troup
of
dogs
that
loitered
in
an
alley
back
of
the
store
took
sam
for
a
walk
into
the
country
i
will
continue
this
talk
of
love
said
telfer
striking
at
weeds
along
the
road
with
his
cane
and
from
time
to
time
calling
sharply
to
the
dogs
that
filled
with
delight
at
being
abroad
ran
growling
and
tumbling
over
each
other
in
the
dusty
road
that
freedom
smith
is
a
sample
of
life
in
this
town
at
the
word
love
he
drops
his
feet
upon
the
floor
and
pretends
to
be
filled
with
disgust
he
will
talk
of
corn
or
steers
or
of
the
stinking
hides
that
he
buys
but
at
the
mention
of
the
word
love
he
is
like
a
hen
that
has
seen
a
hawk
in
the
sky
he
runs
about
in
circles
making
a
fuss
here
here
here
he
cries
you
are
making
public
something
that
should
be
kept
hidden
you
are
doing
in
the
light
of
day
what
should
only
be
done
with
a
shamed
face
in
a
darkened
why
boy
if
i
were
a
woman
in
this
town
i
would
not
stand
it
i
would
go
to
new
york
to
france
to
paris
to
be
wooed
for
but
a
passing
moment
by
a
yokel
without
art
uh
it
is
the
man
and
the
boy
walked
in
silence
the
dogs
scenting
a
rabbit
disappeared
across
a
long
pasture
their
master
letting
them
go
from
time
to
time
he
threw
back
his
head
and
took
long
breaths
of
the
night
air
i
am
not
like
banker
walker
he
declared
he
thinks
of
the
growing
corn
in
terms
of
fat
steers
feeding
on
the
rabbit
run
farm
i
think
of
it
as
something
majestic
i
see
the
long
corn
rows
with
the
men
and
the
horses
half
hidden
hot
and
breathless
and
i
think
of
a
vast
river
of
life
i
catch
a
breath
of
the
flame
that
was
in
the
mind
of
the
man
who
said
the
land
is
flowing
with
milk
and
i
am
made
happy
by
my
thoughts
not
by
the
dollars
clinking
in
my
pocket
and
then
in
the
fall
when
the
corn
stands
shocked
i
see
another
picture
here
and
there
in
companies
stand
the
armies
of
the
corn
it
puts
a
ring
in
my
voice
to
look
at
them
these
orderly
armies
has
mankind
brought
out
of
chaos
i
say
to
myself
on
a
smoking
black
ball
flung
by
the
hand
of
god
out
of
illimitable
space
has
man
stood
up
these
armies
to
defend
his
home
against
the
grim
attacking
armies
of
telfer
stopped
and
stood
in
the
road
with
his
legs
spread
apart
he
took
off
his
hat
and
throwing
back
his
head
laughed
up
at
the
stars
freedom
smith
should
hear
me
now
he
cried
rocking
back
and
forth
with
laughter
and
switching
his
cane
at
the
boy
s
legs
so
that
sam
had
to
hop
merrily
about
in
the
road
to
avoid
it
flung
by
the
hand
of
god
out
of
illimitable
space
eh
not
bad
eh
i
should
be
in
congress
i
am
wasted
here
i
am
throwing
priceless
eloquence
to
dogs
who
prefer
to
chase
rabbits
and
to
a
boy
who
is
the
worst
little
money
grubber
in
the
the
midsummer
madness
that
had
seized
telfer
passed
and
for
a
time
he
walked
in
silence
suddenly
putting
his
arm
on
the
boy
s
shoulder
he
stopped
and
pointed
to
where
a
faint
light
in
the
sky
marked
the
lighted
town
they
are
good
people
he
said
but
their
ways
are
not
my
ways
or
your
ways
you
will
go
out
of
the
town
you
have
genius
you
will
be
a
man
of
finance
i
have
watched
you
you
are
not
niggardly
and
you
do
not
cheat
and
lie
result
you
will
not
be
a
little
business
man
what
have
you
you
have
the
gift
of
seeing
dollars
where
the
rest
of
the
boys
of
the
town
see
nothing
and
you
are
tireless
after
those
dollars
you
will
be
a
big
man
of
dollars
it
is
into
his
voice
came
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
also
was
marked
out
why
do
i
carry
a
cane
why
do
i
not
buy
a
farm
and
raise
steers
i
am
the
most
worthless
thing
alive
i
have
the
touch
of
genius
without
the
energy
to
make
it
sam
s
mind
that
had
been
inflamed
by
the
kiss
of
the
girl
cooled
in
the
presence
of
telfer
in
the
summer
madness
of
the
talking
man
there
was
something
soothing
to
the
fever
in
his
blood
he
followed
the
words
eagerly
seeing
pictures
getting
thrills
filled
with
happiness
at
the
edge
of
town
a
buggy
passed
the
walking
pair
in
the
buggy
sat
a
young
farmer
his
arm
about
the
waist
of
a
girl
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
far
in
the
distance
sounded
the
faint
call
of
the
dogs
sam
and
telfer
sat
down
on
a
grassy
bank
under
a
tree
while
telfer
rolled
and
lighted
a
cigarette
as
i
promised
i
will
talk
to
you
of
love
he
said
making
a
wide
sweep
with
his
arm
each
time
as
he
put
his
cigarette
into
his
mouth
the
grassy
bank
on
which
they
lay
had
the
rich
burned
smell
of
the
hot
days
a
wind
rustled
the
standing
corn
that
formed
a
kind
of
wall
behind
them
the
moon
was
in
the
sky
and
shone
down
across
bank
after
bank
of
serried
clouds
the
grandiloquence
went
out
of
the
voice
of
telfer
and
his
face
became
serious
my
foolishness
is
more
than
half
earnest
he
said
i
think
that
a
man
or
boy
who
has
set
for
himself
a
task
had
better
let
women
and
girls
alone
if
he
be
a
man
of
genius
he
has
a
purpose
independent
of
all
the
world
and
should
cut
and
slash
and
pound
his
way
toward
his
mark
forgetting
every
one
particularly
the
woman
that
would
come
to
grips
with
him
she
also
has
a
mark
toward
which
she
goes
she
is
at
war
with
him
and
has
a
purpose
that
is
not
his
purpose
she
believes
that
the
pursuit
of
women
is
an
end
for
a
life
for
all
they
now
condemn
mike
mccarthy
who
went
to
the
asylum
because
of
them
and
who
while
loving
life
came
near
to
taking
life
the
women
of
caxton
do
not
condemn
his
madness
for
themselves
they
do
not
blame
him
for
loitering
away
his
good
years
or
for
making
an
abortive
mess
of
his
good
brain
while
he
made
an
art
of
the
pursuit
of
women
they
applauded
secretly
did
not
twelve
of
them
accept
the
challenge
thrown
out
by
his
eyes
as
he
loitered
in
the
streets
the
man
who
had
begun
talking
quietly
and
seriously
raised
his
voice
and
waved
the
lighted
cigarette
in
the
air
and
the
boy
who
had
begun
to
think
again
of
the
daughter
of
banker
walker
listened
attentively
the
barking
of
the
dogs
grew
nearer
if
you
as
a
boy
can
get
from
me
a
grown
man
an
understanding
of
the
purpose
of
women
you
will
not
have
lived
in
this
town
for
nothing
set
your
mark
at
money
making
if
you
will
but
drive
at
that
let
yourself
but
go
and
a
sweet
wistful
pair
of
eyes
seen
in
a
street
crowd
or
a
pair
of
little
feet
running
over
a
dance
floor
will
retard
your
growth
for
years
no
man
or
boy
can
grow
toward
the
purpose
of
a
life
while
he
thinks
of
women
let
him
try
it
and
he
will
be
undone
what
is
to
him
a
passing
humour
is
to
them
an
end
they
are
diabolically
clever
they
will
run
and
stop
and
run
and
stop
again
keeping
just
without
his
reach
he
sees
them
here
and
there
about
him
his
mind
is
filled
with
vague
delicious
thoughts
that
come
out
of
the
very
air
before
he
realises
what
he
has
done
he
has
spent
his
years
in
vain
pursuit
and
turning
finds
himself
old
and
telfer
began
jabbing
at
the
ground
with
his
stick
i
had
my
chance
in
new
york
i
had
money
to
live
on
and
time
to
have
made
an
artist
of
myself
i
won
prize
after
prize
the
master
walking
up
and
down
back
of
us
lingered
longest
over
my
easel
there
was
a
fellow
sat
beside
me
who
had
nothing
i
made
sport
of
him
and
called
him
sleepy
jock
after
a
dog
we
used
to
have
about
our
house
here
in
caxton
now
i
am
here
idly
waiting
for
death
and
that
jock
where
is
he
only
last
week
i
saw
in
a
paper
that
he
had
won
a
place
among
the
world
s
great
artists
by
a
picture
he
has
painted
in
the
school
i
watched
for
a
look
in
the
eyes
of
the
girl
students
and
went
about
with
them
night
after
night
winning
like
mike
mccarthy
fruitless
victories
sleepy
jock
had
the
best
of
it
he
did
not
look
about
with
open
eyes
but
kept
peering
instead
at
the
face
of
the
master
my
days
were
full
of
small
successes
i
could
wear
clothes
i
could
make
girls
turn
to
look
at
me
in
a
dance
hall
i
remember
a
night
we
students
gave
a
dance
and
sleepy
jock
came
he
went
about
asking
for
dances
and
the
girls
laughed
and
told
him
they
had
none
to
give
that
the
dances
were
taken
i
followed
him
and
had
my
ears
filled
with
flattery
and
my
card
with
names
in
riding
the
wave
of
small
success
i
got
the
habit
of
small
success
when
i
could
not
catch
the
line
i
wanted
to
make
a
drawing
live
i
dropped
my
pencil
and
taking
a
girl
upon
my
arm
went
for
a
day
in
the
country
once
sitting
in
a
restaurant
i
overheard
two
women
talking
of
the
beauty
of
my
eyes
and
was
made
happy
for
a
telfer
threw
up
his
hands
in
disgust
my
flow
of
words
my
ready
trick
of
talking
to
what
does
it
bring
me
let
me
tell
you
it
has
brought
me
to
this
that
at
fifty
i
who
might
have
been
an
artist
fixing
the
minds
of
thousands
upon
some
thing
of
beauty
or
of
truth
have
become
a
village
a
wit
a
flinger
of
idle
words
into
the
air
of
a
village
intent
upon
raising
corn
if
you
ask
me
why
i
tell
you
that
my
mind
was
paralysed
by
small
success
and
if
you
ask
me
where
i
got
the
taste
for
that
i
tell
you
that
i
got
it
when
i
saw
it
lurking
in
a
woman
s
eyes
and
heard
the
pleasant
little
songs
that
lull
to
sleep
upon
a
woman
s
the
boy
sitting
upon
the
grassy
bank
beside
telfer
began
thinking
of
life
in
caxton
the
man
smoking
the
cigarette
fell
into
one
of
his
rare
silences
the
boy
thought
of
girls
that
had
come
into
his
mind
at
night
of
how
he
had
been
thrilled
by
a
glance
from
the
eyes
of
a
little
school
girl
who
had
once
visited
at
freedom
smith
s
home
and
of
how
he
had
gone
at
night
to
stand
under
her
window
in
caxton
adolescent
love
had
about
it
a
virility
befitting
a
land
that
raised
so
many
bushels
of
yellow
corn
and
drove
so
many
fat
steers
through
the
streets
to
be
loaded
upon
cars
men
and
women
went
their
ways
believing
with
characteristic
american
attitude
toward
the
needs
of
childhood
that
it
was
well
for
growing
boys
and
girls
to
be
much
alone
together
to
leave
them
alone
together
was
a
principle
with
them
when
a
young
man
called
upon
his
sweetheart
her
parents
sat
in
the
presence
of
the
two
with
apologetic
eyes
and
presently
disappeared
leaving
them
alone
together
when
boys
and
girls
parties
were
given
in
caxton
houses
parents
went
away
leaving
the
children
to
shift
for
themselves
now
have
a
good
time
and
don
t
tear
the
house
down
they
said
going
off
upstairs
left
to
themselves
the
children
played
kissing
games
and
young
men
and
tall
girls
sat
on
the
front
porches
in
the
darkness
thrilled
and
half
frightened
getting
through
their
instincts
crudely
and
without
guidance
their
first
peep
at
the
mystery
of
life
they
kissed
passionately
and
the
young
men
walking
home
lay
upon
their
beds
fevered
and
unnaturally
aroused
thinking
thoughts
young
men
went
into
the
company
of
girls
time
and
again
without
knowing
aught
of
them
except
that
they
caused
a
stirring
of
their
whole
being
a
kind
of
riot
of
the
senses
to
which
they
returned
on
other
evenings
as
a
drunkard
to
his
cups
after
such
an
evening
they
found
themselves
on
the
next
morning
confused
and
filled
with
vague
longings
they
had
lost
their
keenness
for
fun
they
heard
without
hearing
the
talk
of
the
men
about
the
station
and
in
the
stores
they
went
slinking
through
the
streets
in
groups
and
people
seeing
them
nodded
their
heads
and
said
it
is
the
loutish
if
sam
did
not
have
a
loutish
age
it
was
due
to
his
tireless
struggle
to
increase
the
totals
at
the
foot
of
the
pages
in
the
yellow
bankbook
to
the
growing
ill
health
of
his
mother
that
had
begun
to
frighten
him
and
to
the
society
of
valmore
wildman
freedom
smith
and
the
man
who
now
sat
musing
beside
him
he
began
to
think
he
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
walker
girl
he
remembered
his
sister
s
affair
with
a
young
farmer
and
shuddered
at
the
crude
vulgarity
of
it
he
looked
over
the
shoulder
of
the
man
sitting
beside
him
absorbed
in
thought
and
saw
the
rolling
fields
stretched
away
in
the
moonlight
and
into
his
mind
came
telfer
s
speech
so
vivid
so
moving
seemed
the
picture
of
the
armies
of
standing
corn
which
men
had
set
up
in
the
fields
to
protect
themselves
against
the
march
of
pitiless
nature
and
sam
holding
the
picture
in
his
mind
as
he
followed
the
sense
of
telfer
s
talk
thought
that
all
society
had
resolved
itself
into
a
few
sturdy
souls
who
went
on
and
on
regardless
and
a
hunger
to
make
of
himself
such
another
arose
engulfing
him
the
desire
within
him
seemed
so
compelling
that
he
turned
and
haltingly
tried
to
express
what
was
in
his
mind
i
will
try
he
stammered
i
will
try
to
be
a
man
i
will
try
to
not
have
anything
to
do
with
them
with
women
i
will
work
and
make
money
and
and
speech
left
him
he
rolled
over
and
lying
on
his
stomach
looked
at
the
ground
to
hell
with
women
and
girls
he
burst
forth
as
though
throwing
something
distasteful
out
of
his
throat
in
the
road
a
clamour
arose
the
dogs
giving
up
the
pursuit
of
rabbits
came
barking
and
growling
into
sight
and
scampered
up
the
grassy
bank
covering
the
man
and
the
boy
shaking
off
the
reaction
upon
his
sensitive
nature
of
the
emotions
of
the
boy
telfer
arose
his
had
returned
to
him
cutting
right
and
left
with
his
stick
at
the
dogs
he
cried
joyfully
we
have
had
enough
of
eloquence
from
man
boy
and
dog
we
will
be
on
our
way
we
will
get
this
boy
sam
home
and
tucked
into
chapter
v
sam
was
a
man
of
fifteen
when
the
call
of
the
city
came
to
him
for
six
years
he
had
been
upon
the
streets
he
had
seen
the
sun
come
up
hot
and
red
over
the
corn
fields
and
had
stumbled
through
the
streets
in
the
bleak
darkness
of
winter
mornings
when
the
trains
from
the
north
came
into
caxton
covered
with
ice
and
the
trainmen
stood
on
the
deserted
little
platform
whipping
their
arms
and
calling
to
jerry
donlin
to
hurry
with
his
work
that
they
might
get
back
into
the
warm
stale
air
of
the
smoking
car
in
the
six
years
the
boy
had
grown
more
and
more
determined
to
become
a
man
of
money
fed
by
banker
walker
the
silent
mother
and
in
some
subtle
way
by
the
very
air
he
breathed
the
belief
within
him
that
to
make
money
and
to
have
money
would
in
some
way
make
up
for
the
old
humiliations
in
the
life
of
the
mcpherson
family
and
would
set
it
on
a
more
secure
foundation
than
the
wobbly
windy
had
provided
grew
and
influenced
his
thoughts
and
his
acts
tirelessly
he
kept
at
his
efforts
to
get
ahead
in
his
bed
at
night
he
dreamed
of
dollars
jane
mcpherson
had
herself
a
passion
for
frugality
in
spite
of
windy
s
incompetence
and
her
own
growing
ill
health
she
would
not
permit
the
family
to
go
into
debt
and
although
in
the
long
hard
winters
sam
sometimes
ate
cornmeal
mush
until
his
mind
revolted
at
the
thought
of
a
corn
field
yet
was
the
rent
of
the
little
house
paid
on
the
scratch
and
her
boy
fairly
driven
to
increase
the
totals
in
the
yellow
bankbook
even
valmore
who
since
the
death
of
his
wife
had
lived
in
a
loft
above
his
shop
and
who
was
a
blacksmith
of
the
old
days
a
workman
first
and
a
money
maker
later
did
not
despise
the
thought
of
gain
it
is
money
makes
the
mare
go
he
said
with
a
kind
of
reverence
as
banker
walker
fat
sleek
and
prosperous
walked
pompously
out
of
wildman
s
grocery
of
john
telfer
s
attitude
toward
the
boy
was
uncertain
the
man
followed
with
joyous
abandonment
the
impulse
of
the
moment
that
s
right
he
cried
impatiently
when
sam
who
had
begun
to
express
opinions
at
the
gatherings
in
the
grocery
pointed
out
hesitatingly
that
the
papers
took
account
of
men
of
wealth
no
matter
what
their
achievements
make
money
cheat
lie
be
one
of
the
men
of
the
big
world
get
your
name
up
for
a
modern
american
and
in
the
next
breath
turning
upon
freedom
smith
who
had
begun
to
berate
the
boy
for
not
sticking
to
the
schools
and
who
predicted
that
the
day
would
come
when
sam
would
regret
his
lack
of
book
learning
he
shouted
let
the
schools
go
they
are
but
musty
beds
in
which
old
clerkliness
lies
asleep
among
the
travelling
men
who
came
to
caxton
to
sell
goods
the
boy
who
had
continued
the
paper
selling
even
after
attaining
the
stature
of
a
man
was
a
favourite
sitting
in
chairs
before
the
new
leland
house
they
talked
to
him
of
the
city
and
of
the
money
to
be
made
there
it
is
the
place
for
a
live
young
man
they
said
sam
had
a
talent
for
drawing
people
into
talk
of
themselves
and
of
their
affairs
and
began
to
cultivate
travelling
men
from
them
he
got
into
his
nostrils
a
whiff
of
the
city
and
listening
to
them
he
saw
the
great
ways
filled
with
hurrying
people
the
tall
buildings
touching
the
sky
the
men
running
about
intent
upon
and
the
clerks
going
on
year
after
year
on
small
salaries
getting
nowhere
a
part
of
and
yet
not
understanding
the
impulses
and
motives
of
the
enterprises
that
supported
them
in
this
picture
sam
thought
he
saw
a
place
for
himself
he
conceived
of
life
in
the
city
as
a
great
game
in
which
he
believed
he
could
play
a
sterling
part
had
he
not
in
caxton
brought
something
out
of
nothing
had
he
not
systematised
and
monopolised
the
selling
of
papers
had
he
not
introduced
the
vending
of
popcorn
and
peanuts
from
baskets
to
the
saturday
night
crowds
already
boys
went
out
in
his
employ
already
the
totals
in
the
bank
book
had
crept
to
more
than
seven
hundred
dollars
he
felt
within
him
a
glow
of
pride
at
the
thought
of
what
he
had
done
and
would
do
i
will
be
richer
than
any
man
in
town
here
he
declared
in
his
pride
i
will
be
richer
than
ed
saturday
night
was
the
great
night
in
caxton
life
for
it
the
clerks
in
the
stores
prepared
for
it
sam
sent
forth
his
peanut
and
popcorn
venders
for
it
art
sherman
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
put
the
glasses
close
by
the
beer
tap
under
the
bar
and
for
it
the
mechanics
the
farmers
and
the
labourers
dressed
in
their
sunday
best
and
came
forth
to
mingle
with
their
fellows
on
main
street
crowds
packed
the
stores
the
sidewalks
and
drinking
places
and
men
stood
about
in
groups
talking
while
young
girls
with
their
lovers
walked
up
and
down
in
the
hall
over
geiger
s
drug
store
a
dance
went
on
and
the
voice
of
the
rose
above
the
clatter
of
voices
and
the
stamping
of
horses
in
the
street
now
and
then
a
fight
broke
out
among
the
roisterers
in
piety
hollow
once
a
young
farm
hand
was
killed
with
a
knife
in
and
out
through
the
crowd
sam
went
pressing
his
wares
remember
the
long
quiet
sunday
afternoon
he
said
pushing
a
paper
into
the
hands
of
a
farmer
recipes
for
cooking
new
dishes
he
urged
to
the
farmer
s
wife
there
is
a
page
of
new
fashions
in
dress
he
told
the
young
girl
not
until
the
last
light
was
out
in
the
last
saloon
in
piety
hollow
and
the
last
roisterer
had
driven
off
into
the
darkness
carrying
a
saturday
paper
in
his
pocket
did
sam
close
the
day
s
business
and
it
was
on
a
saturday
night
that
he
decided
to
drop
paper
selling
i
will
take
you
into
business
with
me
announced
freedom
smith
stopping
him
as
he
hurried
by
you
are
getting
too
old
to
sell
papers
and
you
know
too
sam
still
intent
upon
the
money
to
be
made
on
that
particular
saturday
night
did
not
stop
to
discuss
the
matter
with
freedom
but
for
a
year
he
had
been
looking
quietly
about
for
something
to
go
into
and
now
he
nodded
his
head
as
he
hurried
away
it
is
the
end
of
romance
shouted
telfer
who
stood
beside
freedom
smith
before
geiger
s
drug
store
and
who
had
heard
the
offer
a
boy
who
has
seen
the
secret
workings
of
my
mind
who
has
heard
me
spout
poe
and
browning
will
become
a
merchant
dealing
in
stinking
hides
i
am
overcome
by
the
the
next
day
sitting
in
the
garden
back
of
his
house
telfer
talked
to
sam
of
the
matter
at
length
for
you
my
boy
i
put
the
matter
of
money
in
the
first
place
he
declared
leaning
back
in
his
chair
smoking
a
cigarette
and
from
time
to
time
tapping
eleanor
on
the
shoulder
with
his
cane
for
any
boy
i
put
in
the
first
place
it
is
only
women
and
fools
who
despise
look
at
eleanor
here
the
time
and
thought
she
puts
into
the
selling
of
hats
would
be
the
death
of
me
but
it
has
been
the
making
of
her
see
how
fine
and
purposeful
she
has
become
without
the
millinery
business
she
would
be
a
purposeless
fool
intent
upon
clothes
and
with
it
she
is
all
a
woman
should
be
it
is
like
a
child
to
eleanor
who
had
turned
to
laugh
at
her
husband
looked
instead
at
the
ground
and
a
shadow
crossed
her
face
telfer
who
had
begun
talking
thoughtlessly
out
of
his
excess
of
words
glanced
from
the
woman
to
the
boy
he
knew
that
the
suggestion
regarding
a
child
had
touched
a
secret
regret
in
eleanor
and
began
trying
to
efface
the
shadow
on
her
face
by
throwing
himself
into
the
subject
that
chanced
to
be
on
his
tongue
making
the
words
roll
and
tumble
from
his
lips
no
matter
what
may
come
in
the
future
in
our
day
precedes
many
virtues
that
are
forever
on
men
s
lips
he
declared
fiercely
as
though
trying
to
down
an
opponent
it
is
one
of
the
virtues
that
proves
man
not
a
savage
it
has
lifted
him
up
not
but
the
power
to
make
money
money
makes
life
livable
it
gives
freedom
and
destroys
fear
having
it
means
sanitary
houses
and
clothes
it
brings
into
men
s
lives
beauty
and
the
love
of
beauty
it
enables
a
man
to
go
adventuring
after
the
stuff
of
life
as
i
have
done
writers
are
fond
of
telling
stories
of
the
crude
excesses
of
great
wealth
he
went
on
hurriedly
glancing
again
at
eleanor
no
doubt
the
things
they
tell
of
do
happen
money
and
not
the
ability
and
the
instinct
to
make
money
is
at
fault
and
what
of
the
cruder
excesses
of
poverty
the
drunken
men
who
beat
and
starve
their
families
the
grim
silences
of
the
crowded
unsanitary
houses
of
the
poor
the
inefficient
and
the
defeated
go
sit
around
the
lounging
room
of
the
most
vapid
rich
man
s
city
club
as
i
have
done
and
then
sit
among
the
workers
of
a
factory
at
the
noon
hour
virtue
you
will
find
is
no
fonder
of
poverty
than
you
and
i
and
the
man
who
has
merely
learned
to
be
industrious
and
who
has
not
acquired
that
eager
hunger
and
shrewdness
that
enables
him
to
get
on
may
build
up
a
strong
dexterous
body
while
his
mind
is
diseased
and
grasping
his
cane
and
beginning
to
be
carried
away
by
the
wind
of
his
eloquence
telfer
forgot
eleanor
and
talked
for
his
love
of
talking
the
mind
that
has
in
it
the
love
of
the
beautiful
that
stuff
that
makes
our
poets
artists
musicians
and
actors
needs
this
turn
for
shrewd
money
getting
or
it
will
destroy
itself
he
declared
and
the
really
great
artists
have
it
in
books
and
stories
the
great
men
starve
in
garrets
in
real
life
they
are
more
likely
to
ride
in
carriages
on
fifth
avenue
and
have
country
places
on
the
hudson
go
see
for
yourself
visit
the
starving
genius
in
his
garret
it
is
a
hundred
to
one
that
you
will
find
him
not
only
incapable
in
money
getting
but
also
incapable
in
the
very
art
for
which
he
after
the
hurried
word
from
freedom
smith
sam
began
looking
for
a
buyer
for
the
paper
business
the
place
offered
appealed
to
him
and
he
wanted
a
chance
at
it
in
the
buying
of
potatoes
butter
eggs
apples
and
hides
he
thought
he
could
make
money
also
he
knew
that
the
dogged
persistency
with
which
he
had
kept
at
the
putting
of
money
in
the
bank
had
caught
freedom
s
imagination
and
he
wanted
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
within
a
few
days
the
deal
was
made
sam
got
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
the
list
of
newspaper
customers
the
peanut
and
popcorn
business
and
the
transfer
of
the
exclusive
agencies
he
had
arranged
with
the
dailies
of
des
moines
and
louis
two
boys
bought
the
business
backed
by
their
fathers
a
talk
in
the
back
room
of
the
bank
with
the
cashier
telling
of
sam
s
record
as
a
depositor
and
the
seven
hundred
dollars
surplus
clinched
the
deal
when
it
came
to
the
deal
with
freedom
sam
took
him
into
the
back
room
at
the
bank
and
showed
his
savings
as
he
had
shown
them
to
the
fathers
of
the
two
boys
freedom
was
impressed
he
thought
the
boy
would
make
money
for
him
twice
within
a
week
sam
had
seen
the
silent
suggestive
power
of
cash
the
deal
sam
made
with
freedom
included
a
fair
weekly
wage
enough
to
more
than
take
care
of
all
his
wants
and
in
addition
he
was
to
have
of
all
he
saved
freedom
in
the
buying
freedom
on
the
other
hand
was
to
furnish
horse
vehicle
and
keep
for
the
horse
while
sam
was
to
take
care
of
the
horse
the
prices
to
be
paid
for
the
things
bought
were
to
be
fixed
each
morning
by
freedom
and
if
sam
bought
at
less
than
the
prices
named
of
the
savings
went
to
him
the
arrangement
was
suggested
by
sam
who
thought
he
would
make
more
from
the
saving
than
from
the
wage
freedom
smith
discussed
even
the
most
trivial
matter
in
a
loud
voice
roaring
and
shouting
in
the
store
and
on
the
streets
he
was
a
great
inventor
of
descriptive
names
having
a
name
of
his
own
for
every
man
woman
and
child
he
knew
and
liked
old
he
called
windy
mcpherson
and
would
roar
at
him
in
the
grocery
asking
him
not
to
shed
rebel
blood
in
the
sugar
barrel
he
drove
about
the
country
in
a
low
phaeton
buggy
that
rattled
and
squeaked
enormously
and
had
a
wide
rip
in
the
top
to
sam
s
knowledge
neither
the
buggy
nor
freedom
were
washed
during
his
stay
with
the
man
he
had
a
method
of
his
own
in
buying
stopping
in
front
of
a
farm
house
he
would
sit
in
his
buggy
and
roar
until
the
farmer
came
out
of
the
field
or
the
house
to
talk
with
him
and
then
haggling
and
shouting
he
would
make
his
deal
or
drive
on
his
way
while
the
farmer
leaning
on
the
fence
laughed
as
at
a
wayward
child
freedom
lived
in
a
large
old
brick
house
facing
one
of
caxton
s
best
streets
his
house
and
yard
were
an
eyesore
to
his
neighbours
who
liked
him
personally
he
knew
this
and
would
stand
on
his
front
porch
laughing
and
roaring
about
it
good
morning
mary
he
would
shout
at
the
neat
german
woman
across
the
street
wait
and
you
ll
see
me
clean
up
about
here
i
m
going
at
it
right
now
i
m
going
to
brush
the
flies
off
the
fence
once
he
ran
for
a
county
office
and
got
practically
every
vote
in
the
county
freedom
had
a
passion
for
buying
up
old
buggies
and
agricultural
implements
bringing
them
home
to
stand
in
the
yard
gathering
rust
and
decay
and
swearing
they
were
as
good
as
new
in
the
lot
were
a
half
dozen
buggies
and
a
family
carriage
or
two
a
traction
engine
a
mowing
machine
several
farm
wagons
and
other
farm
tools
gone
beyond
naming
every
few
days
he
came
home
bringing
a
new
prize
they
overflowed
the
yard
and
crept
onto
the
porch
sam
never
knew
him
to
sell
any
of
this
stuff
he
had
at
one
time
sixteen
sets
of
harness
all
broken
and
unrepaired
in
the
barn
and
in
a
shed
back
of
the
house
a
great
flock
of
chickens
and
two
or
three
pigs
wandered
about
among
this
junk
and
all
the
children
of
the
neighbourhood
joined
freedom
s
four
and
ran
howling
and
shouting
over
and
under
the
mass
freedom
s
wife
a
pale
silent
woman
rarely
came
out
of
the
house
she
had
a
liking
for
the
industrious
sam
and
occasionally
stood
at
the
back
door
and
talked
with
him
in
a
low
even
voice
at
evening
as
he
stood
unhitching
his
horse
after
a
day
on
the
road
both
she
and
freedom
treated
him
with
great
respect
as
a
buyer
sam
was
even
more
successful
than
at
the
paper
selling
he
was
a
buyer
by
instinct
working
a
wide
stretch
of
country
very
systematically
and
within
a
year
more
than
doubling
the
bulk
of
freedom
s
purchases
there
is
a
little
of
windy
mcpherson
s
grotesque
pretentiousness
in
every
man
and
his
son
soon
learned
to
look
for
and
to
take
advantage
of
it
he
let
men
talk
until
they
had
exaggerated
or
overstated
the
value
of
their
goods
then
called
them
sharply
to
accounts
and
before
they
had
recovered
from
their
confusion
drove
home
the
bargain
in
sam
s
day
farmers
did
not
watch
the
daily
market
reports
in
fact
the
markets
were
not
systematised
and
regulated
as
they
were
later
and
the
skill
of
the
buyer
was
of
the
first
importance
having
the
skill
sam
used
it
constantly
to
put
money
into
his
pockets
but
in
some
way
kept
the
confidence
and
respect
of
the
men
with
whom
he
traded
the
noisy
blustering
freedom
was
as
proud
as
a
father
of
the
trading
ability
that
developed
in
the
boy
and
roared
his
name
up
and
down
the
streets
and
in
the
stores
declaring
him
the
smartest
boy
in
iowa
mighty
little
of
old
in
that
boy
he
would
shout
to
the
loafers
in
the
store
although
sam
had
an
almost
painful
desire
for
order
and
system
in
his
own
affairs
he
did
not
try
to
bring
these
influences
into
freedom
s
affairs
but
kept
his
own
records
carefully
and
bought
potatoes
and
apples
butter
and
eggs
furs
and
hides
with
untiring
zeal
working
always
to
swell
his
commissions
freedom
took
the
risks
in
the
business
and
many
times
profited
little
but
the
two
liked
and
respected
each
other
and
it
was
through
freedom
s
efforts
that
sam
finally
got
out
of
caxton
and
into
larger
affairs
one
evening
in
the
late
fall
freedom
came
into
the
stable
where
sam
stood
taking
the
harness
off
his
horse
here
is
a
chance
for
you
my
boy
he
said
putting
his
hand
affectionately
on
sam
s
shoulder
there
was
a
note
of
tenderness
in
his
voice
he
had
written
to
the
chicago
firm
to
whom
he
sold
most
of
the
things
he
bought
telling
of
sam
and
his
ability
and
the
firm
had
replied
making
an
offer
that
sam
thought
far
beyond
anything
he
might
hope
for
in
caxton
in
his
hand
he
held
this
offer
when
sam
read
the
letter
his
heart
jumped
he
thought
that
it
opened
for
him
a
wide
new
field
of
effort
and
of
money
making
he
thought
that
at
last
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
boyhood
and
was
to
have
his
chance
in
the
city
only
that
morning
old
doctor
harkness
had
stopped
him
at
the
door
as
he
set
out
for
work
and
pointing
over
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
to
where
in
the
house
his
mother
lay
wasted
and
asleep
had
told
him
that
in
another
week
she
would
be
gone
and
sam
heavy
of
heart
and
filled
with
uneasy
longing
had
walked
through
the
streets
to
freedom
s
stable
wishing
that
he
also
might
be
gone
now
he
walked
across
the
stable
floor
and
hung
the
harness
he
had
taken
from
the
horse
upon
a
peg
in
the
wall
i
will
be
glad
to
go
he
said
heavily
freedom
walked
out
of
the
stable
door
beside
the
young
mcpherson
who
had
come
to
him
as
a
boy
and
was
now
a
young
man
of
eighteen
he
did
not
want
to
lose
sam
he
had
written
the
chicago
company
because
of
his
affection
for
the
boy
and
because
he
believed
him
capable
of
something
more
than
caxton
offered
now
he
walked
in
silence
holding
the
lantern
aloft
and
guiding
the
way
among
the
wreckage
in
the
yard
filled
with
regrets
by
the
back
door
of
the
house
stood
the
pale
wife
who
putting
out
her
hand
took
the
hand
of
the
boy
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
then
saying
nothing
sam
turned
and
hurried
off
up
the
street
freedom
and
his
wife
walked
to
the
front
gate
and
watched
him
go
from
a
street
corner
where
he
stopped
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
sam
could
see
them
there
the
wind
swinging
the
lantern
in
freedom
s
hand
and
the
slender
little
old
wife
making
a
white
blotch
against
the
darkness
chapter
vi
sam
went
along
the
board
sidewalk
homeward
bound
hurried
by
the
driving
march
wind
that
had
sent
the
lantern
swinging
in
freedom
s
hand
at
the
front
of
a
white
frame
residence
a
old
man
stood
leaning
on
the
gate
and
looking
at
the
sky
we
shall
have
a
rain
he
said
in
a
quavering
voice
as
though
giving
a
decision
in
the
matter
and
then
turned
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
went
along
a
narrow
path
into
the
house
the
incident
brought
a
smile
to
sam
s
lips
followed
by
a
kind
of
weariness
of
mind
since
the
beginning
of
his
work
with
freedom
he
had
day
after
day
come
upon
henry
kimball
standing
by
his
gate
and
looking
at
the
sky
the
man
was
one
of
sam
s
old
newspaper
customers
who
stood
as
a
kind
of
figure
in
the
town
it
was
said
of
him
that
in
his
youth
he
had
been
a
gambler
on
the
mississippi
river
and
that
he
had
taken
part
in
more
than
one
wild
adventure
in
the
old
days
after
the
civil
war
he
had
come
to
end
his
days
in
caxton
living
alone
and
occupying
himself
by
keeping
year
after
year
a
carefully
tabulated
record
of
weather
variations
once
or
twice
a
month
during
the
warm
season
he
stumbled
into
wildman
s
and
sitting
by
the
stove
talked
boastfully
of
the
accuracy
of
his
records
and
the
doings
of
a
mangy
dog
that
trotted
at
his
heels
in
his
present
mood
the
endless
sameness
and
uneventfulness
of
the
man
s
life
seemed
to
sam
amusing
and
in
some
way
sad
to
depend
upon
going
to
the
gate
and
looking
at
the
sky
to
give
point
to
a
day
to
look
forward
to
and
depend
upon
that
what
deadliness
he
thought
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
felt
with
pleasure
the
letter
from
the
chicago
company
that
was
to
open
so
much
of
the
big
outside
world
to
him
in
spite
of
the
shock
of
unexpected
sadness
that
had
come
with
what
he
felt
was
almost
a
definite
parting
with
freedom
and
the
sadness
brought
on
by
his
mother
s
approaching
death
sam
felt
a
strong
thrill
of
confidence
in
his
own
future
that
made
his
homeward
walk
almost
cheerful
the
thrill
got
from
reading
the
letter
handed
him
by
freedom
was
renewed
by
the
sight
of
old
henry
kimball
at
the
gate
looking
at
the
sky
i
shall
never
be
like
that
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
world
watching
a
mangy
dog
chase
a
ball
and
peering
day
after
day
at
a
thermometer
he
thought
the
three
years
in
freedom
smith
s
service
had
taught
sam
not
to
doubt
his
ability
to
cope
with
such
business
problems
as
might
come
in
his
way
he
knew
that
he
had
become
what
he
wanted
to
be
a
good
business
man
one
of
the
men
who
direct
and
control
the
affairs
in
which
they
are
concerned
because
of
a
quality
in
them
called
business
sense
he
recalled
with
pleasure
the
fact
that
the
men
of
caxton
had
stopped
calling
him
a
bright
boy
and
now
spoke
of
him
as
a
good
business
man
at
the
gate
before
his
own
house
he
stopped
and
stood
thinking
of
these
things
and
of
the
dying
woman
within
back
into
his
mind
came
the
old
man
he
had
seen
at
the
gate
and
with
him
the
thought
that
his
mother
s
life
had
been
as
barren
as
that
of
the
man
who
depended
for
companionship
upon
a
dog
and
a
thermometer
indeed
he
said
to
himself
pursuing
the
thought
it
has
been
worse
she
has
not
had
a
fortune
on
which
to
live
in
peace
nor
has
she
had
the
remembrance
of
youthful
days
of
wild
adventure
that
must
comfort
the
last
days
of
the
old
man
instead
she
has
been
watching
me
as
the
old
man
watches
his
thermometer
and
father
has
been
the
dog
in
her
house
chasing
the
figure
pleased
him
he
stood
at
the
gate
the
wind
singing
in
the
trees
along
the
street
and
driving
an
occasional
drop
of
rain
against
his
cheek
and
thought
of
it
and
of
his
life
with
his
mother
during
the
last
two
or
three
years
he
had
been
trying
to
make
things
up
to
her
after
the
sale
of
the
newspaper
business
and
the
beginning
of
his
success
with
freedom
he
had
driven
her
from
the
washtub
and
since
the
beginning
of
her
ill
health
he
had
spent
evening
after
evening
with
her
instead
of
going
to
wildman
s
to
sit
with
the
four
friends
and
hear
the
talk
that
went
on
among
them
no
more
did
he
walk
with
telfer
or
mary
underwood
on
country
roads
but
sat
instead
by
the
bedside
of
the
sick
woman
or
the
night
falling
fair
helped
her
to
an
arm
chair
upon
the
grass
plot
at
the
front
of
the
house
the
years
sam
felt
had
been
good
years
they
had
brought
him
an
understanding
of
his
mother
and
had
given
a
seriousness
and
purpose
to
the
ambitious
plans
he
continued
to
make
for
himself
alone
together
the
mother
and
he
had
talked
little
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
making
much
speech
impossible
to
her
and
the
growing
understanding
of
her
making
it
unnecessary
to
him
now
in
the
darkness
before
the
house
he
thought
of
the
evenings
he
had
spent
with
her
and
of
the
pitiful
waste
that
had
been
made
of
her
fine
life
things
that
had
hurt
him
and
against
which
he
had
been
bitter
and
unforgiving
became
of
small
import
even
the
doings
of
the
pretentious
windy
who
in
the
face
of
jane
s
illness
continued
to
go
off
after
pension
day
for
long
periods
of
drunkenness
and
who
only
came
home
to
weep
and
wail
through
the
house
when
the
pension
money
was
gone
regretting
sam
tried
in
fairness
to
think
the
loss
of
both
the
washwoman
and
the
wife
she
has
been
the
most
wonderful
woman
in
the
world
he
told
himself
and
tears
of
happiness
came
into
his
eyes
at
the
thought
of
his
friend
john
telfer
who
in
bygone
days
had
praised
the
mother
to
the
newsboy
trotting
beside
him
on
moonlit
roads
into
his
mind
came
a
picture
of
her
long
gaunt
face
ghastly
now
against
the
white
of
the
pillows
a
picture
of
george
eliot
tacked
to
the
wall
behind
a
broken
harness
in
the
kitchen
of
freedom
smith
s
house
had
caught
his
eye
some
days
before
and
in
the
darkness
he
took
it
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
to
his
lips
realising
that
in
some
indescribable
way
it
was
like
his
mother
as
she
had
been
before
her
illness
freedom
s
wife
had
given
him
the
picture
and
he
had
been
carrying
it
taking
it
out
of
his
pocket
on
lonely
stretches
of
road
as
he
went
about
his
work
sam
went
quietly
around
the
house
and
stood
by
an
old
shed
a
relic
of
an
attempt
by
windy
to
embark
in
raising
chickens
he
wanted
to
continue
the
thoughts
of
his
mother
he
began
recalling
her
youth
and
the
details
of
a
long
talk
they
had
held
together
on
the
lawn
before
the
house
it
was
extraordinarily
vivid
in
his
mind
he
thought
that
even
now
he
could
remember
every
word
that
had
been
said
the
sick
woman
had
talked
of
her
youth
in
ohio
and
as
she
talked
pictures
had
come
into
the
boy
s
mind
she
had
told
him
of
her
days
as
a
bound
girl
in
the
family
of
a
new
englander
who
had
come
west
to
take
a
farm
and
of
her
struggles
to
obtain
an
education
of
the
pennies
saved
to
buy
books
of
her
joy
when
she
had
passed
examinations
and
become
a
school
teacher
and
of
her
marriage
to
windy
then
john
mcpherson
into
the
ohio
village
the
young
mcpherson
had
come
to
cut
a
figure
in
the
town
s
life
sam
had
smiled
at
the
picture
she
drew
of
the
young
man
who
walked
up
and
down
the
village
street
with
girls
on
his
arms
and
who
taught
a
bible
class
in
the
sunday
school
when
windy
proposed
to
the
young
school
teacher
she
had
accepted
him
eagerly
thinking
it
unbelievably
romantic
that
so
dashing
a
man
should
have
chosen
so
obscure
a
figure
among
all
the
women
of
the
town
and
even
now
i
am
not
sorry
although
it
has
meant
nothing
but
labour
and
unhappiness
for
me
the
sick
woman
had
told
her
son
after
marriage
to
the
young
dandy
jane
had
come
with
him
to
caxton
where
he
bought
a
store
and
where
within
three
years
he
had
put
the
store
into
the
sheriff
s
hands
and
his
wife
into
the
position
of
town
laundress
in
the
darkness
a
grim
smile
half
scorn
half
amusement
had
flitted
across
the
face
of
the
dying
woman
as
she
told
of
a
winter
when
windy
and
another
young
fellow
went
from
schoolhouse
to
schoolhouse
over
the
state
giving
a
show
the
had
become
a
singer
of
comic
songs
and
had
written
letter
after
letter
to
the
young
wife
telling
of
the
applause
that
greeted
his
efforts
sam
could
picture
the
performances
the
little
schoolhouses
with
the
weatherbeaten
faces
shining
in
the
light
of
the
leaky
magic
lantern
and
the
delighted
windy
running
here
and
there
talking
the
jargon
of
stageland
arraying
himself
in
his
motley
and
strutting
upon
the
little
stage
and
all
winter
he
did
not
send
me
a
penny
the
sick
woman
had
said
interrupting
his
thoughts
aroused
at
last
to
expression
and
filled
with
the
memory
of
her
youth
the
silent
woman
had
talked
of
her
own
people
her
father
had
been
killed
in
the
woods
by
a
falling
tree
of
her
mother
she
told
an
anecdote
touching
it
briefly
and
with
a
grim
humour
that
surprised
her
son
the
young
school
teacher
had
gone
to
call
upon
her
mother
once
and
for
an
hour
had
sat
in
the
parlour
of
an
ohio
farmhouse
while
a
fierce
old
woman
looked
at
her
with
bold
questioning
eyes
that
made
the
daughter
feel
she
had
been
a
fool
to
come
at
the
railroad
station
she
had
heard
an
anecdote
of
her
mother
the
story
ran
that
once
a
burly
tramp
came
to
the
farmhouse
and
finding
the
woman
alone
tried
to
bully
her
and
that
the
tramp
and
the
woman
then
in
her
prime
fought
for
an
hour
in
the
back
yard
of
the
house
the
railroad
agent
who
told
jane
the
story
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
she
knocked
him
out
too
he
said
knocked
him
cold
upon
the
ground
and
then
filled
him
up
with
hard
cider
so
that
he
came
reeling
into
town
declaring
her
the
finest
woman
in
the
in
the
darkness
by
the
broken
shed
sam
s
mind
turned
from
thoughts
of
his
mother
to
his
sister
kate
and
of
her
love
affair
with
the
young
farmer
he
thought
with
sadness
of
how
she
too
had
suffered
because
of
the
failings
of
the
father
of
how
she
had
been
compelled
to
go
out
of
the
house
to
wander
in
the
dark
streets
to
avoid
the
endless
evenings
of
war
talk
always
brought
on
by
a
guest
in
the
mcpherson
household
and
of
the
night
when
getting
a
rig
from
culvert
s
livery
she
had
driven
off
alone
into
the
country
to
return
in
triumph
to
pack
her
clothes
and
show
her
wedding
ring
before
him
there
rose
a
picture
of
a
summer
afternoon
when
he
had
seen
a
part
of
the
love
making
that
had
preceded
this
he
had
gone
into
the
store
to
see
his
sister
when
the
young
farmer
came
in
looked
awkwardly
about
and
pushed
a
new
gold
watch
across
the
counter
to
kate
a
sudden
wave
of
respect
for
his
sister
had
pervaded
the
boy
what
a
sum
it
must
have
cost
he
thought
and
looked
with
new
interest
at
the
back
of
the
lover
and
at
the
flushed
cheek
and
shining
eyes
of
his
sister
when
the
lover
turning
had
seen
young
mcpherson
standing
at
the
counter
he
laughed
and
walked
out
at
the
door
kate
had
been
embarrassed
and
secretly
pleased
and
flattered
by
the
look
in
her
brother
s
eyes
but
had
pretended
to
treat
the
gift
lightly
twirling
it
carelessly
back
and
forth
on
the
counter
and
walking
up
and
down
swinging
her
arms
don
t
go
telling
she
had
said
then
don
t
go
pretending
the
boy
had
answered
sam
thought
that
his
sister
s
indiscretion
which
had
brought
her
a
babe
and
a
husband
in
the
same
month
had
after
all
ended
better
than
the
indiscretion
of
his
mother
in
her
marriage
with
windy
rousing
himself
he
went
into
the
house
a
neighbour
woman
employed
for
the
purpose
had
prepared
the
evening
meal
and
now
began
complaining
of
his
lateness
saying
that
the
food
had
got
cold
sam
ate
in
silence
while
he
ate
the
woman
went
out
of
the
house
and
presently
returned
bringing
a
daughter
there
was
in
caxton
a
code
that
would
not
allow
a
woman
to
be
alone
in
a
house
with
a
man
sam
wondered
if
the
bringing
of
the
daughter
was
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
woman
to
abide
by
the
letter
of
the
code
if
she
thought
of
the
sick
woman
in
the
house
as
one
already
gone
the
thought
amused
and
saddened
him
you
would
have
thought
her
safe
he
mused
she
was
fifty
small
nervous
and
worn
and
wore
a
set
of
false
teeth
that
rattled
as
she
talked
when
she
did
not
talk
she
rattled
them
with
her
tongue
because
of
nervousness
in
at
the
kitchen
door
came
windy
far
gone
in
drink
he
stood
by
the
door
holding
to
the
knob
with
his
hand
and
trying
to
get
control
of
himself
my
wife
my
wife
is
dying
she
may
die
any
day
he
wailed
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
the
woman
with
the
daughter
went
into
the
little
parlour
where
a
bed
had
been
put
for
the
sick
woman
sam
sat
at
the
kitchen
table
dumb
with
anger
and
disgust
as
windy
lurching
forward
fell
into
a
chair
and
began
sobbing
loudly
in
the
road
outside
a
man
driving
a
horse
stopped
and
sam
could
hear
the
scraping
of
the
wheels
against
the
buggy
body
as
the
man
turned
in
the
narrow
street
above
the
scraping
of
the
wheels
rose
a
voice
swearing
profanely
the
wind
continued
to
blow
and
it
had
begun
to
rain
he
has
got
into
the
wrong
street
thought
the
boy
stupidly
windy
his
head
upon
his
hands
wept
like
a
brokenhearted
boy
his
sobs
echoing
through
the
house
his
breath
heavy
with
liquor
tainting
the
air
of
the
room
in
a
corner
by
the
stove
the
mother
s
ironing
board
stood
against
the
wall
and
the
sight
of
it
added
fuel
to
the
anger
smouldering
in
sam
s
heart
he
remembered
the
day
when
he
had
stood
in
the
store
doorway
with
his
mother
and
had
seen
the
dismal
and
amusing
failure
of
his
father
with
the
bugle
and
of
the
months
before
kate
s
wedding
when
windy
had
gone
blustering
about
town
threatening
to
kill
her
lover
and
the
mother
and
boy
had
stayed
with
the
girl
out
of
sight
in
the
house
sick
with
humiliation
the
drunken
man
laying
his
head
upon
the
table
fell
asleep
his
snores
replacing
the
sobs
that
had
stirred
the
boy
s
anger
sam
began
thinking
again
of
his
mother
s
life
the
effort
he
had
made
to
repay
her
for
the
hardness
of
her
life
now
seemed
utterly
fruitless
i
would
like
to
repay
him
he
thought
shaken
with
a
sudden
spasm
of
hatred
as
he
looked
at
the
man
before
him
the
cheerless
little
kitchen
the
cold
potatoes
and
sausages
on
the
table
and
the
drunken
man
asleep
seemed
to
him
a
kind
of
symbol
of
the
life
that
had
been
lived
in
that
house
and
with
a
shudder
he
turned
his
face
and
stared
at
the
wall
he
thought
of
a
dinner
he
had
once
eaten
at
freedom
smith
s
house
freedom
had
brought
the
invitation
into
the
stables
on
that
night
just
as
he
had
brought
the
letter
from
the
chicago
company
and
just
as
sam
was
shaking
his
head
in
refusal
of
the
invitation
in
at
the
stable
door
had
come
the
children
led
by
the
eldest
a
great
tomboy
girl
of
fourteen
with
the
strength
of
a
man
and
an
inclination
to
burst
out
of
her
clothes
at
unexpected
places
they
had
come
charging
into
the
stables
to
carry
sam
off
to
the
dinner
freedom
laughingly
urging
them
on
his
voice
roaring
in
the
stable
so
that
the
horses
jumped
about
in
their
stalls
into
the
house
they
had
dragged
him
the
baby
a
boy
of
four
sitting
astride
his
back
and
beating
on
his
head
with
a
woollen
cap
and
freedom
swinging
a
lantern
and
giving
an
occasional
helpful
push
with
his
hand
a
picture
of
the
long
table
covered
with
the
white
cloth
at
the
end
of
the
big
dining
room
in
freedom
s
house
came
back
into
the
mind
of
the
boy
now
sitting
in
the
barren
little
kitchen
before
the
untasted
food
upon
it
lay
a
profusion
of
bread
and
meat
and
great
dishes
heaped
with
steaming
potatoes
at
his
own
house
there
had
always
been
just
enough
food
for
the
single
meal
the
thing
was
nicely
calculated
when
you
had
finished
the
table
was
bare
how
he
had
enjoyed
that
dinner
after
the
long
day
on
the
road
with
a
flourish
and
a
roar
at
the
children
freedom
heaped
high
the
plates
and
passed
them
about
the
wife
or
the
tomboy
girl
bringing
unending
fresh
supplies
from
the
kitchen
the
joy
of
the
evening
with
its
talk
of
the
children
in
school
its
sudden
revelation
of
the
womanliness
of
the
tomboy
girl
and
its
air
of
plenty
and
good
living
haunted
the
mind
of
the
boy
my
mother
never
knew
anything
like
that
he
thought
the
drunken
man
who
had
been
sleeping
aroused
himself
and
began
talking
loudly
some
old
forgotten
grievance
coming
back
to
his
mind
he
talked
of
the
cost
of
school
books
they
change
the
books
in
the
school
too
often
he
declared
in
a
loud
voice
turning
and
facing
the
kitchen
stove
as
though
addressing
an
audience
it
is
a
scheme
to
graft
on
old
soldiers
who
have
children
i
will
not
stand
sam
enraged
beyond
speech
tore
a
leaf
from
a
notebook
and
scrawled
a
message
upon
it
be
silent
he
wrote
if
you
say
another
word
or
make
another
sound
to
disturb
mother
i
will
choke
you
and
throw
you
like
a
dead
dog
into
the
reaching
across
the
table
and
touching
his
father
on
the
hand
with
a
fork
taken
from
among
the
dishes
he
laid
the
note
upon
the
table
under
the
lamp
before
his
eyes
he
was
fighting
with
himself
to
control
a
desire
to
spring
across
the
room
and
kill
the
man
who
he
believed
had
brought
his
mother
to
her
death
and
who
now
sat
bellowing
and
talking
at
her
very
death
bed
the
desire
distorted
his
mind
so
that
he
stared
about
the
kitchen
like
one
seized
with
an
insane
nightmare
windy
taking
the
note
in
his
hand
read
it
slowly
and
then
not
understanding
its
import
and
but
half
getting
its
sense
put
it
in
his
pocket
a
dog
is
dead
eh
he
shouted
well
you
re
getting
too
big
and
smart
lad
what
do
i
care
for
a
dead
dog
sam
did
not
answer
rising
cautiously
he
crept
around
the
table
and
put
his
hand
upon
the
throat
of
the
babbling
old
man
i
must
not
kill
he
kept
telling
himself
aloud
as
though
talking
to
a
stranger
i
must
choke
until
he
is
silent
but
i
must
not
in
the
kitchen
the
two
men
struggled
silently
windy
unable
to
rise
struck
out
wildly
and
helplessly
with
his
feet
sam
looking
down
at
him
and
studying
the
eyes
and
the
colour
in
the
cheeks
realised
with
a
start
that
he
had
not
for
years
seen
the
face
of
his
father
how
vividly
it
stamped
itself
upon
his
mind
now
and
how
coarse
and
sodden
it
had
become
i
could
repay
all
of
the
years
mother
has
spent
over
the
dreary
washtub
by
just
one
long
hard
grip
at
this
lean
throat
i
could
kill
him
with
so
little
extra
pressure
he
thought
the
eyes
began
to
stare
at
him
and
the
tongue
to
protrude
across
the
forehead
ran
a
streak
of
mud
picked
up
somewhere
in
the
long
afternoon
of
drunken
carousing
if
i
were
to
press
hard
now
and
kill
him
i
would
see
his
face
as
it
looks
now
all
the
days
of
my
life
thought
the
boy
in
the
silence
of
the
house
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
neighbour
woman
speaking
sharply
to
her
daughter
the
familiar
dry
tired
cough
of
the
sick
woman
followed
sam
took
the
unconscious
old
man
in
his
arms
and
went
carefully
and
silently
out
at
the
kitchen
door
the
rain
beat
down
upon
him
and
as
he
went
around
the
house
with
his
burden
the
wind
shaking
loose
a
dead
branch
from
a
small
apple
tree
in
the
yard
blew
it
against
his
face
leaving
a
long
smarting
scratch
at
the
fence
before
the
house
he
stopped
and
threw
his
burden
down
a
short
grassy
bank
into
the
road
then
turning
he
went
bareheaded
through
the
gate
and
up
the
street
i
will
go
for
mary
underwood
he
thought
his
mind
returning
to
the
friend
who
years
before
had
walked
with
him
on
country
roads
and
whose
friendship
he
had
dropped
because
of
john
telfer
s
tirades
against
all
women
he
stumbled
along
the
sidewalk
the
rain
beating
down
upon
his
bare
head
we
need
a
woman
in
our
house
he
kept
saying
over
and
over
to
himself
we
need
a
woman
in
our
chapter
vii
leaning
against
the
wall
under
the
veranda
of
mary
underwood
s
house
sam
tried
to
get
in
his
mind
a
remembrance
of
what
had
brought
him
there
he
had
walked
bareheaded
through
main
street
and
out
along
a
country
road
twice
he
had
fallen
covering
his
clothes
with
mud
he
had
forgotten
the
purpose
of
his
walk
and
had
tramped
on
and
on
the
unexpected
and
terrible
hatred
of
his
father
that
had
come
upon
him
in
the
tense
silence
of
the
kitchen
had
so
paralysed
his
brain
that
he
now
felt
and
wonderfully
happy
and
carefree
i
have
been
doing
something
he
thought
i
wonder
what
it
the
house
faced
a
grove
of
pine
trees
and
was
reached
by
climbing
a
little
rise
and
following
a
winding
road
out
beyond
the
graveyard
and
the
last
of
the
village
lights
the
wild
spring
rain
pounded
and
rattled
on
the
tin
roof
overhead
and
sam
his
back
closely
pressed
against
the
front
of
the
house
fought
to
regain
control
of
his
mind
for
an
hour
he
stood
there
staring
into
the
darkness
and
watched
with
delight
the
progress
of
the
storm
he
had
an
inheritance
from
his
mother
a
love
of
thunderstorms
he
remembered
a
night
when
he
was
a
boy
and
his
mother
had
got
out
of
bed
and
gone
here
and
there
through
the
house
singing
she
had
sung
softly
so
that
the
sleeping
father
did
not
hear
and
in
his
bed
upstairs
sam
had
lain
awake
listening
to
the
noises
the
rain
on
the
roof
the
occasional
crash
of
thunder
the
snoring
of
windy
and
the
unusual
and
he
thought
beautiful
sound
of
the
mother
singing
in
the
storm
now
lifting
up
his
head
he
looked
about
with
delight
trees
in
the
grove
in
front
of
him
bent
and
tossed
in
the
wind
the
inky
blackness
of
the
night
was
relieved
by
the
flickering
oil
lamp
in
the
road
beyond
the
graveyard
and
in
the
distance
by
the
lights
streaming
out
at
the
windows
of
the
houses
the
light
coming
out
of
the
house
against
which
he
stood
made
a
little
cylinder
of
brightness
among
the
pine
trees
through
which
the
raindrops
fell
gleaming
and
sparkling
an
occasional
flash
of
lightning
lit
up
the
trees
and
the
winding
road
and
the
cannonry
of
the
skies
rolled
and
echoed
overhead
a
kind
of
wild
song
sang
in
sam
s
heart
i
wish
it
would
last
all
night
he
thought
his
mind
fixed
on
the
singing
of
his
mother
in
the
dark
house
when
he
was
a
boy
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
stepped
out
upon
the
veranda
and
stood
before
him
facing
the
storm
the
wind
tossing
the
soft
kimono
in
which
she
was
clad
and
the
rain
wetting
her
face
under
the
tin
roof
the
air
was
filled
with
the
rattling
reverberation
of
the
rain
the
woman
lifted
her
head
and
with
the
rain
beating
down
upon
her
began
singing
her
fine
contralto
voice
rising
above
the
rattle
of
the
rain
on
the
roof
and
going
on
uninterrupted
by
the
crash
of
the
thunder
she
sang
of
a
lover
riding
through
the
storm
to
his
mistress
one
refrain
persisted
in
the
song
he
rode
and
he
thought
of
her
red
red
lips
sang
the
woman
putting
her
hand
upon
the
railing
of
the
little
porch
and
leaning
forward
into
the
storm
sam
was
amazed
the
woman
standing
before
him
was
mary
underwood
who
had
been
his
friend
when
he
was
a
boy
in
school
and
toward
whom
his
mind
had
turned
after
the
tragedy
in
the
kitchen
the
figure
of
the
woman
standing
singing
before
him
became
a
part
of
his
thoughts
of
his
mother
singing
on
the
stormy
night
in
the
house
and
his
mind
wandered
on
seeing
pictures
as
he
used
to
see
them
when
a
boy
walking
under
the
stars
and
listening
to
the
talk
of
john
telfer
he
saw
a
man
shouting
defiance
to
the
storm
as
he
rode
down
a
mountain
path
and
he
laughed
at
the
rain
on
his
wet
wet
cloak
went
on
the
voice
of
the
singer
mary
underwood
s
singing
there
in
the
rain
made
her
seem
near
and
likeable
as
she
had
seemed
to
him
when
he
was
a
barefoot
boy
john
telfer
was
wrong
about
her
he
thought
she
turned
and
faced
him
tiny
streams
of
water
ran
from
her
hair
down
across
her
cheeks
a
flash
of
lightning
cut
the
darkness
illuminating
the
spot
where
sam
now
a
man
stood
with
the
mud
upon
his
clothes
and
the
bewildered
look
upon
his
face
a
sharp
exclamation
of
surprise
broke
from
her
lips
hello
sam
what
are
you
doing
here
you
had
better
get
in
out
of
the
i
like
it
here
replied
sam
lifting
his
head
and
looking
past
her
at
the
storm
walking
to
the
door
and
standing
with
her
hand
upon
the
knob
mary
looked
into
the
darkness
you
have
been
a
long
time
coming
to
see
me
she
said
come
within
the
house
with
the
door
closed
the
rattle
of
the
rain
on
the
veranda
roof
sank
to
a
subdued
quiet
drumming
piles
of
books
lay
upon
a
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
there
were
other
books
on
the
shelves
along
the
walls
on
a
table
burned
a
student
s
lamp
and
in
the
corners
of
the
room
lay
heavy
shadows
sam
stood
by
the
wall
near
the
door
looking
about
with
eyes
mary
who
had
gone
to
another
part
of
the
house
and
who
now
returned
clad
in
a
long
cloak
looked
at
him
with
quick
curiosity
and
began
moving
about
the
room
picking
up
odds
and
ends
of
woman
s
clothing
scattered
on
the
chairs
kneeling
she
lighted
a
fire
under
some
sticks
piled
in
an
open
grate
at
the
side
of
the
room
it
was
the
storm
made
me
want
to
sing
she
said
and
then
briskly
we
shall
have
to
be
drying
you
out
you
have
fallen
in
the
road
and
got
yourself
covered
with
from
being
morose
and
silent
sam
became
talkative
an
idea
had
come
into
his
mind
i
have
come
here
courting
he
thought
i
have
come
to
ask
mary
underwood
to
be
my
wife
and
live
in
my
the
woman
kneeling
by
the
blazing
sticks
made
a
picture
that
aroused
something
that
had
been
sleeping
in
him
the
heavy
cloak
she
wore
falling
away
showed
the
round
little
shoulders
imperfectly
covered
by
the
kimono
wet
and
clinging
to
them
the
slender
youthful
figure
the
soft
grey
hair
and
the
serious
little
face
lit
by
the
burning
sticks
caused
a
jumping
of
his
heart
we
are
needing
a
woman
in
our
house
he
said
heavily
repeating
the
words
that
had
been
on
his
lips
as
he
stumbled
through
the
streets
and
along
the
roads
we
are
needing
a
woman
in
our
house
and
i
have
come
to
take
you
there
i
intend
to
marry
you
he
added
lurching
across
the
room
and
grasping
her
roughly
by
the
shoulders
why
not
i
am
needing
a
mary
underwood
was
dismayed
and
frightened
by
the
face
looking
down
at
her
and
by
the
strong
hands
clenched
upon
her
shoulders
in
his
youth
she
had
conceived
a
kind
of
maternal
passion
for
the
newsboy
and
had
planned
a
future
for
him
her
plans
if
followed
would
have
made
him
a
scholar
a
man
living
his
life
among
books
and
ideas
instead
he
had
chosen
to
live
his
life
among
men
to
be
a
to
drive
about
the
country
like
freedom
smith
making
deals
with
farmers
she
had
seen
him
driving
at
evening
through
the
street
to
freedom
s
house
going
in
and
out
of
wildman
s
and
walking
through
the
streets
with
men
in
a
dim
way
she
knew
that
an
influence
had
been
at
work
upon
him
to
win
him
from
the
things
of
which
she
had
dreamed
and
she
had
secretly
blamed
john
telfer
the
talking
laughing
idler
now
out
of
the
storm
the
boy
had
come
back
to
her
his
hands
and
his
clothes
covered
with
the
mud
of
the
road
and
talked
to
her
a
woman
old
enough
to
be
his
mother
of
marriage
and
of
coming
to
live
with
him
in
his
house
she
stood
chilled
looking
into
the
eager
strong
face
and
the
eyes
with
the
pained
dazed
look
in
them
under
her
gaze
something
of
the
old
feeling
of
the
boy
came
back
to
sam
and
he
began
vaguely
trying
to
tell
her
of
it
it
was
not
the
talk
of
telfer
drove
me
from
you
he
began
it
was
because
you
talked
so
much
of
the
schools
and
of
books
i
was
tired
of
them
i
could
not
go
on
year
after
year
sitting
in
a
stuffy
little
schoolroom
when
there
was
so
much
money
to
be
made
in
the
world
i
grew
tired
of
the
school
teachers
drumming
with
their
fingers
on
the
desks
and
looking
out
at
the
windows
at
men
passing
in
the
street
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
there
and
into
the
streets
dropping
his
hands
from
her
shoulders
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
stared
into
the
fire
now
blazing
steadily
steam
began
to
rise
from
his
trousers
legs
his
mind
still
working
beyond
his
control
began
to
reconstruct
an
old
boyhood
fancy
half
his
own
half
john
telfer
s
that
had
years
before
come
into
his
mind
it
concerned
a
picture
he
and
telfer
had
made
of
the
ideal
scholar
the
picture
had
as
its
central
figure
a
feeble
old
man
stumbling
along
the
street
muttering
to
himself
and
poking
in
a
gutter
with
a
stick
the
picture
was
a
caricature
of
puttering
old
frank
huntley
superintendent
of
the
caxton
schools
sitting
before
the
fire
in
mary
underwood
s
house
become
for
the
moment
a
boy
facing
a
boy
s
problems
sam
did
not
want
to
be
such
a
man
he
wanted
only
that
in
scholarship
which
would
help
him
to
be
the
kind
of
man
he
was
bent
on
being
a
man
of
the
world
doing
the
work
of
the
world
and
making
money
by
his
work
things
he
had
been
unable
to
get
expressed
when
he
was
a
boy
and
her
friend
coming
again
into
his
mind
he
felt
that
he
must
here
and
now
make
it
plain
to
mary
underwood
that
the
schools
were
not
giving
him
what
he
wanted
his
brain
worked
on
the
problem
of
how
to
tell
her
about
it
turning
he
looked
at
her
and
said
earnestly
i
am
going
to
quit
the
schools
it
is
not
your
fault
but
i
am
going
to
quit
just
the
mary
who
had
been
looking
down
at
the
great
figure
in
the
chair
began
to
understand
a
light
came
into
her
eyes
going
to
the
door
opening
into
a
stairway
leading
to
sleeping
rooms
above
she
called
sharply
auntie
come
down
here
at
once
there
is
a
sick
man
a
startled
trembling
voice
answered
from
above
who
is
it
mary
underwood
did
not
answer
she
came
back
to
sam
and
putting
her
hand
gently
on
his
shoulder
said
it
is
your
mother
and
you
are
only
a
sick
boy
after
all
is
she
dead
tell
me
about
sam
shook
his
head
she
is
still
there
in
the
bed
he
roused
himself
and
stood
up
i
have
just
killed
my
father
he
announced
i
choked
him
and
threw
him
down
the
bank
into
the
road
in
front
of
the
house
he
made
horrible
noises
in
the
kitchen
and
mother
was
tired
and
wanted
to
mary
underwood
began
running
about
the
room
from
a
little
alcove
under
a
stairway
she
took
clothes
throwing
them
upon
the
floor
about
the
room
she
pulled
on
a
stocking
and
unconscious
of
sam
s
presence
raised
her
skirts
and
fastened
it
then
putting
one
shoe
on
the
stockinged
foot
and
the
other
on
the
bare
one
she
turned
to
him
we
will
go
back
to
your
house
i
think
you
are
right
you
need
a
woman
in
the
street
she
walked
rapidly
along
clinging
to
the
arm
of
the
tall
fellow
who
strode
silently
beside
her
a
cheerfulness
had
come
over
sam
he
felt
he
had
accomplished
something
something
he
had
set
out
to
accomplish
he
again
thought
of
his
mother
and
drifting
into
the
notion
that
he
was
on
his
way
home
from
work
at
freedom
smith
s
began
planning
the
evening
he
would
spend
with
her
i
will
tell
her
of
the
letter
from
the
chicago
company
and
of
what
i
will
do
when
i
go
to
the
city
he
thought
at
the
gate
before
the
mcpherson
house
mary
looked
into
the
road
below
the
grassy
bank
that
ran
down
from
the
fence
but
in
the
darkness
she
could
see
nothing
the
rain
continued
to
fall
and
the
wind
screamed
and
shouted
as
it
rushed
through
the
bare
branches
of
the
trees
sam
went
through
the
gate
and
around
the
house
to
the
kitchen
door
intent
upon
getting
to
his
mother
s
bedside
in
the
house
the
neighbour
woman
sat
asleep
in
a
chair
before
the
kitchen
stove
the
daughter
had
gone
sam
went
through
the
house
to
the
parlour
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
beside
his
mother
s
bed
picking
up
her
hand
and
holding
it
in
his
own
she
must
be
asleep
he
thought
at
the
kitchen
door
mary
underwood
stopped
and
turning
ran
away
into
the
darkness
along
the
street
by
the
kitchen
fire
the
neighbour
woman
still
slept
in
the
parlour
sam
sitting
on
the
chair
beside
his
mother
s
bed
looked
about
him
a
lamp
burned
dimly
upon
the
little
stand
beside
the
bed
and
the
light
of
it
fell
upon
the
portrait
of
a
tall
woman
with
rings
on
her
fingers
that
hung
upon
the
wall
the
picture
belonged
to
windy
and
was
claimed
by
him
as
a
portrait
of
his
mother
and
it
had
once
brought
on
a
quarrel
between
sam
and
his
sister
kate
had
taken
the
portrait
of
the
lady
seriously
and
the
boy
had
come
upon
her
sitting
in
a
chair
before
it
her
hair
rearranged
and
her
hands
lying
in
her
lap
in
imitation
of
the
pose
maintained
so
haughtily
by
the
great
lady
who
looked
down
at
her
it
is
a
fraud
he
had
declared
irritated
by
what
he
believed
his
sister
s
devotion
to
one
of
the
father
s
pretensions
it
is
a
fraud
he
has
picked
up
somewhere
and
now
claims
as
his
mother
to
make
people
believe
he
is
something
the
girl
ashamed
at
having
been
caught
in
the
pose
and
furious
because
of
the
attack
upon
the
authenticity
of
the
portrait
had
gone
into
a
spasm
of
indignation
putting
her
hands
to
her
ears
and
stamping
on
the
floor
with
her
foot
then
she
had
run
across
the
room
and
dropped
upon
her
knees
before
a
little
couch
buried
her
face
in
a
pillow
and
shook
with
anger
and
grief
sam
had
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
room
the
emotions
of
the
sister
had
seemed
to
him
to
have
the
flavour
of
one
of
windy
s
outbreaks
she
likes
it
he
had
thought
dismissing
the
incident
she
likes
believing
in
lies
she
is
like
windy
and
would
rather
believe
in
them
than
mary
underwood
ran
through
the
rain
to
john
telfer
s
house
and
beat
on
the
door
with
her
fist
until
telfer
followed
by
eleanor
holding
a
lamp
above
her
head
appeared
at
the
door
with
telfer
she
went
back
through
the
streets
to
the
front
of
sam
s
house
thinking
of
the
terrible
choked
and
disfigured
man
they
should
find
there
she
went
along
clinging
to
telfer
s
arm
as
she
had
clung
to
sam
s
unconscious
of
her
bare
head
and
scanty
attire
in
his
hand
telfer
carried
a
lantern
secured
from
the
stable
in
the
road
before
the
house
they
found
nothing
telfer
went
up
and
down
swinging
the
lantern
and
peering
into
gutters
the
woman
walked
beside
him
her
skirts
lifted
and
the
mud
splashing
upon
her
bare
leg
suddenly
telfer
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
taking
her
hand
he
led
mary
with
a
rush
up
the
bank
and
through
the
gate
what
a
old
fool
i
am
he
cried
i
am
getting
old
and
windy
mcpherson
is
not
dead
nothing
could
kill
that
old
war
horse
he
was
in
at
wildman
s
grocery
after
nine
o
clock
covered
with
mud
and
swearing
he
had
been
in
a
fight
with
art
sherman
poor
sam
and
you
to
have
come
to
me
and
to
have
found
me
a
stupid
ass
fool
fool
what
a
fool
i
have
become
in
at
the
kitchen
door
ran
mary
and
telfer
frightening
the
woman
by
the
stove
so
that
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
began
nervously
making
the
false
teeth
rattle
with
her
tongue
in
the
parlour
they
found
sam
his
head
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
asleep
in
his
hand
he
held
the
cold
hand
of
jane
mcpherson
she
had
been
dead
for
an
hour
mary
underwood
stooped
over
and
kissed
his
wet
hair
as
the
neighbour
woman
came
in
at
the
doorway
bearing
the
kitchen
lamp
and
john
telfer
holding
his
finger
to
his
lips
commanded
silence
chapter
viii
the
funeral
of
jane
mcpherson
was
a
trying
affair
for
her
son
he
thought
that
his
sister
kate
with
the
babe
in
her
arms
had
become
coarsened
she
looked
frumpish
and
while
they
were
in
the
house
had
an
air
of
having
quarrelled
with
her
husband
when
they
came
out
of
their
bedroom
in
the
morning
during
the
funeral
service
sam
sat
in
the
parlour
astonished
and
irritated
by
the
endless
number
of
women
that
crowded
into
the
house
they
were
everywhere
in
the
kitchen
the
sleeping
room
back
of
the
parlour
and
in
the
parlour
where
the
dead
woman
lay
in
her
coffin
they
were
massed
when
the
minister
holding
a
book
in
his
hand
held
forth
upon
the
virtues
of
the
dead
woman
they
wept
sam
looked
at
the
floor
and
thought
that
thus
they
would
have
wept
over
the
body
of
the
dead
windy
had
his
fingers
but
tightened
a
trifle
he
wondered
if
the
minister
would
have
talked
in
the
same
way
blatantly
and
without
knowledge
of
the
virtues
of
the
dead
in
a
chair
at
the
side
of
the
coffin
the
bereaved
husband
in
new
black
clothes
wept
audibly
the
baldheaded
officious
undertaker
kept
moving
nervously
about
intent
upon
the
ritual
of
his
trade
during
the
service
a
man
sitting
behind
him
dropped
a
note
on
the
floor
at
sam
s
feet
sam
picked
it
up
and
read
it
glad
of
something
to
distract
his
attention
from
the
voice
of
the
minister
and
the
faces
of
the
weeping
women
none
of
whom
had
before
been
in
the
house
and
all
of
whom
he
thought
strikingly
lacking
in
a
sense
of
the
sacredness
of
privacy
the
note
was
from
john
telfer
i
will
not
come
to
your
mother
s
funeral
he
wrote
i
respected
your
mother
while
she
lived
and
i
will
leave
you
alone
with
her
now
that
she
is
dead
in
her
memory
i
will
hold
a
ceremony
in
my
heart
if
i
am
in
wildman
s
i
may
ask
the
man
to
quit
selling
soap
and
tobacco
for
the
moment
and
to
close
and
lock
the
door
if
i
am
at
valmore
s
shop
i
will
go
up
into
his
loft
and
listen
to
him
pounding
on
the
anvil
below
if
he
or
freedom
smith
go
to
your
house
i
warn
them
i
will
cut
their
friendship
when
i
see
the
carriages
going
through
the
street
and
know
that
the
thing
is
right
well
done
and
over
i
will
buy
flowers
and
take
them
to
mary
underwood
as
an
appreciation
of
the
living
in
the
name
of
the
the
note
cheered
and
comforted
sam
it
gave
him
back
a
grip
of
something
that
had
slipped
from
him
it
is
good
sense
after
all
he
thought
and
realised
that
even
in
the
days
when
he
was
being
made
to
suffer
horrors
and
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
jane
mcpherson
s
long
hard
role
was
just
being
played
out
to
the
end
the
farmer
in
the
field
was
sowing
his
corn
valmore
was
beating
upon
his
anvil
and
john
telfer
was
writing
notes
with
a
flourish
he
arose
interrupting
the
minister
s
discourse
mary
underwood
had
come
in
just
as
the
minister
began
talking
and
had
dropped
into
an
obscure
corner
near
the
door
leading
into
the
street
sam
crowded
past
the
women
who
stared
and
the
minister
who
frowned
and
the
baldheaded
undertaker
who
wrung
his
hands
and
dropping
the
note
into
her
lap
said
oblivious
of
the
people
looking
and
listening
with
breathless
curiosity
it
is
from
john
telfer
read
it
even
he
hating
women
as
he
did
is
now
bringing
flowers
to
your
in
the
room
a
wind
of
whispered
comments
sprang
up
women
putting
their
heads
together
and
their
hands
before
their
faces
nodded
toward
the
school
teacher
and
the
boy
unconscious
of
the
sensation
he
had
created
went
back
to
his
chair
and
looked
again
at
the
floor
waiting
until
the
talk
and
the
singing
of
songs
and
the
parading
through
the
streets
should
be
ended
again
the
minister
began
reading
from
the
book
i
have
become
older
than
all
of
these
people
here
thought
the
youth
they
play
at
life
and
death
and
i
have
felt
it
between
the
fingers
of
my
mary
underwood
lacking
sam
s
unconsciousness
of
the
people
looked
about
with
burning
cheeks
seeing
the
women
whispering
and
putting
their
heads
together
a
chill
of
fear
ran
through
her
into
the
room
had
been
thrust
the
face
of
an
old
enemy
to
her
the
scandal
of
a
small
town
picking
up
the
note
she
slipped
out
at
the
door
and
stole
away
along
the
street
the
old
maternal
love
for
sam
had
returned
strengthened
and
ennobled
by
the
terror
through
which
she
had
passed
with
him
that
night
in
the
rain
going
to
her
house
she
whistled
the
collie
dog
and
set
out
along
a
country
road
at
the
edge
of
a
grove
of
trees
she
stopped
sat
down
on
a
log
and
read
telfer
s
note
from
the
soft
ground
into
which
her
feet
sank
there
came
the
warm
pungent
smell
of
the
new
growth
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
thought
that
in
a
few
days
much
had
come
to
her
she
had
got
a
boy
upon
whom
she
could
pour
out
the
mother
love
in
her
heart
and
she
had
made
a
friend
of
telfer
whom
she
had
long
regarded
with
fear
and
doubt
for
a
month
sam
lingered
in
caxton
it
seemed
to
him
there
was
something
that
wanted
doing
there
he
sat
with
the
men
at
the
back
of
wildman
s
and
walked
aimlessly
through
the
streets
and
out
of
the
town
along
the
country
roads
where
men
worked
all
day
in
the
fields
behind
sweating
horses
ploughing
the
land
the
thrill
of
spring
was
in
the
air
and
in
the
evening
a
song
sparrow
sang
in
the
apple
tree
below
his
bedroom
window
sam
walked
and
loitered
in
silence
looking
at
the
ground
in
his
mind
was
the
dread
of
people
the
talk
of
the
men
in
the
store
wearied
him
and
when
he
went
alone
into
the
country
he
found
himself
accompanied
by
the
voices
of
all
of
those
he
had
come
out
of
town
to
escape
on
the
street
corner
the
minister
stopped
him
and
talked
of
the
future
life
as
he
had
stopped
and
talked
to
a
newsboy
your
mother
he
said
has
but
gone
before
it
is
for
you
to
get
into
the
narrow
path
and
follow
her
god
has
sent
this
sorrow
as
a
warning
to
you
he
wants
you
also
to
get
into
the
way
of
life
and
in
the
end
to
join
her
begin
coming
to
our
church
join
in
the
work
of
the
christ
find
sam
who
had
listened
without
hearing
shook
his
head
and
went
on
the
minister
s
talk
seemed
no
more
than
a
meaningless
jumble
of
words
out
of
which
he
got
but
one
thought
find
truth
he
repeated
to
himself
after
the
minister
and
let
his
mind
play
with
the
idea
the
best
men
are
all
trying
to
do
that
they
spend
their
lives
at
the
task
they
are
all
trying
to
find
he
went
along
the
street
pleased
with
himself
because
of
the
interpretation
he
had
put
upon
the
minister
s
words
the
terrible
moments
in
the
kitchen
followed
by
his
mother
s
death
had
put
a
new
look
of
seriousness
into
his
face
and
he
felt
within
him
a
new
sense
of
responsibility
to
the
dead
woman
and
to
himself
men
stopped
him
on
the
street
and
wished
him
well
in
the
city
news
of
his
leaving
had
become
public
things
in
which
freedom
smith
was
concerned
were
always
public
affairs
he
would
take
a
drum
with
him
to
make
love
to
a
neighbour
s
wife
said
john
telfer
sam
felt
that
in
a
way
he
was
a
child
of
caxton
early
it
had
taken
him
to
its
bosom
it
had
made
of
him
a
character
it
had
encouraged
him
in
his
humiliated
him
through
his
father
and
patronised
him
lovingly
because
of
his
toiling
mother
when
he
was
a
boy
scurrying
between
the
legs
of
the
drunkards
in
piety
hollow
of
a
saturday
night
there
was
always
some
one
to
speak
a
word
to
him
of
his
morals
and
to
shout
at
him
a
cheering
word
of
advice
had
he
elected
to
remain
there
with
the
hundred
dollars
already
in
the
savings
bank
built
to
that
during
his
years
with
freedom
smith
he
might
soon
become
one
of
the
town
s
solid
men
he
did
not
want
to
stay
he
felt
that
his
call
was
in
another
place
and
that
he
would
go
there
gladly
he
wondered
why
he
did
not
get
on
the
train
and
be
off
one
night
when
he
had
been
late
on
the
road
loitering
by
fences
hearing
the
lonely
barking
of
dogs
at
distant
farmhouses
getting
the
smell
of
the
ground
into
his
nostrils
he
came
into
town
and
sat
down
on
a
low
iron
fence
that
ran
along
by
the
platform
of
the
railroad
station
to
wait
for
the
midnight
train
north
trains
had
taken
on
a
new
meaning
to
him
since
any
day
might
see
him
on
such
a
train
bound
into
his
new
life
a
man
with
two
bags
in
his
hands
came
on
the
station
platform
followed
by
two
women
here
watch
these
he
said
to
the
women
setting
the
bags
upon
the
platform
i
will
go
for
the
tickets
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
the
two
women
resumed
their
interrupted
talk
ed
s
wife
has
been
poorly
these
ten
years
said
one
of
them
it
will
be
better
for
her
and
for
ed
now
that
she
is
dead
but
i
dread
the
long
ride
i
wish
she
had
died
when
i
was
in
ohio
two
years
ago
i
am
sure
to
be
sam
sitting
in
the
darkness
was
thinking
of
a
part
of
one
of
john
telfer
s
old
talks
with
him
they
are
good
people
but
they
are
not
your
people
you
will
go
away
from
here
you
will
be
a
big
man
of
dollars
it
is
he
began
listening
idly
to
the
two
women
the
man
had
a
shop
for
mending
shoes
on
a
side
street
back
of
geiger
s
drug
store
and
the
two
women
one
short
and
round
one
long
and
thin
kept
a
small
dingy
millinery
shop
and
were
eleanor
telfer
s
only
competitors
well
the
town
knows
her
now
for
what
she
is
said
the
tall
woman
milly
peters
says
she
won
t
rest
until
she
has
put
that
mary
underwood
in
her
place
her
mother
worked
in
the
mcpherson
house
and
it
was
her
told
milly
i
never
heard
such
a
story
to
think
of
jane
mcpherson
working
all
these
years
and
then
having
such
in
her
house
when
she
lay
dying
milly
says
that
sam
went
away
early
in
the
evening
and
came
home
late
with
that
underwood
thing
half
dressed
hanging
on
his
arm
milly
s
mother
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
them
then
she
ran
out
by
the
kitchen
stove
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
she
wanted
to
see
what
was
up
and
the
bold
hussy
came
right
into
the
house
with
sam
then
she
went
away
and
after
a
while
back
she
came
with
that
john
telfer
milly
is
going
to
see
that
eleanor
telfer
finds
it
out
i
guess
it
will
bring
her
down
too
and
there
is
no
telling
how
many
other
men
in
this
town
mary
underwood
is
running
with
milly
says
the
two
women
turned
as
out
of
the
darkness
came
a
tall
figure
roaring
and
swearing
two
hands
flashed
out
and
sank
into
their
hair
stop
it
growled
sam
beating
the
two
heads
together
stop
your
dirty
lies
you
ugly
hearing
the
two
women
screaming
the
man
who
had
gone
for
the
railroad
tickets
came
running
down
the
station
platform
followed
by
jerry
donlin
springing
forward
sam
knocked
the
shoemaker
over
the
iron
fence
into
a
newly
spaded
flower
bed
and
then
turned
to
the
baggage
man
they
were
telling
lies
about
mary
underwood
he
shouted
she
tried
to
save
me
from
killing
my
father
and
now
they
are
telling
lies
about
the
two
women
picked
up
the
bags
and
ran
whimpering
away
along
the
station
platform
jerry
donlin
climbed
over
the
iron
fence
and
confronted
the
surprised
and
frightened
shoemaker
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
in
my
flower
bed
he
growled
hurrying
through
the
streets
sam
s
mind
was
in
a
ferment
like
the
roman
emperor
he
wished
that
all
the
world
had
but
one
head
that
he
might
cut
it
off
with
a
slash
the
town
that
had
seemed
so
paternal
so
cheery
so
intent
upon
wishing
him
well
now
seemed
horrible
he
thought
of
it
as
a
great
crawling
slimy
thing
lying
in
wait
amid
the
cornfields
to
be
saying
that
of
her
of
that
white
soul
he
exclaimed
aloud
in
the
empty
street
all
of
his
boyish
loyalty
and
devotion
to
the
woman
who
had
put
out
a
hand
to
him
in
his
hour
of
trouble
aroused
and
burning
in
him
he
wished
that
he
might
meet
another
man
and
could
hit
him
also
a
swinging
blow
on
the
nose
as
he
had
hit
the
amazed
shoemaker
he
went
to
his
own
house
and
leaning
on
the
gate
stood
looking
at
it
and
swearing
meaninglessly
then
turning
he
went
again
through
the
deserted
streets
past
the
railroad
station
where
the
midnight
train
having
come
and
gone
and
jerry
donlin
having
gone
home
for
the
night
all
was
dark
and
quiet
he
was
filled
with
horror
of
what
mary
underwood
had
seen
at
jane
mcpherson
s
funeral
it
is
better
to
be
utterly
bad
than
to
speak
ill
of
another
he
thought
for
the
first
time
he
realised
another
side
of
village
life
in
fancy
he
saw
going
past
him
on
the
dark
road
a
long
file
of
women
women
with
coarse
unlighted
faces
and
dead
eyes
many
of
the
faces
he
knew
they
were
the
faces
of
caxton
wives
at
whose
houses
he
had
delivered
papers
he
remembered
how
eagerly
they
had
run
out
of
their
houses
to
get
the
papers
and
how
they
hung
day
after
day
over
the
details
of
sensational
murder
cases
once
when
a
chicago
girl
had
been
murdered
in
a
dive
and
the
details
were
unusually
revolting
two
women
unable
to
restrain
their
curiosity
had
come
to
the
station
to
wait
for
the
train
bringing
the
newspapers
and
sam
had
heard
them
rolling
the
horrid
mess
over
and
over
on
their
tongues
in
every
city
and
in
every
village
there
is
a
class
of
women
the
thought
of
whom
paralyses
the
mind
they
live
their
lives
in
small
unaired
unsanitary
houses
and
go
on
year
after
year
washing
dishes
and
clothes
only
their
fingers
occupied
they
read
no
good
books
think
no
clean
thoughts
are
made
love
to
as
john
telfer
had
said
with
kisses
in
a
darkened
room
by
a
yokel
and
after
marrying
some
such
a
yokel
live
lives
of
unspeakable
blankness
into
the
houses
of
these
women
come
the
husbands
at
evening
tired
and
uncommunicative
to
eat
hurriedly
and
then
go
again
into
the
streets
or
the
blessing
of
utter
physical
exhaustion
having
come
to
them
to
sit
for
an
hour
in
stockinged
feet
before
crawling
away
to
sleep
and
oblivion
in
these
women
is
no
light
no
vision
they
have
instead
certain
fixed
ideas
to
which
they
cling
with
a
persistency
touching
heroism
to
the
man
they
have
snatched
from
society
they
cling
also
with
a
tenacity
to
be
measured
only
by
their
love
of
a
roof
over
their
heads
and
the
craving
for
food
to
put
into
their
stomachs
being
mothers
they
are
the
despair
of
reformers
the
shadow
on
the
vision
of
dreamers
and
they
put
the
black
dread
upon
the
heart
of
the
poet
who
cries
the
female
of
the
species
is
more
deadly
than
the
at
their
worst
they
are
to
be
seen
drunk
with
emotion
amid
the
lurid
horrors
of
a
french
revolution
or
immersed
in
the
secret
whispering
creeping
terror
of
a
religious
persecution
at
their
best
they
are
mothers
of
half
mankind
wealth
coming
to
them
they
throw
themselves
into
garish
display
of
it
and
flash
upon
the
sight
of
newport
or
palm
beach
in
their
native
lair
in
the
close
little
houses
they
sleep
in
the
bed
of
the
man
who
has
put
clothes
upon
their
backs
and
food
into
their
mouths
because
that
is
the
usage
of
their
kind
and
give
him
of
their
bodies
grudgingly
or
willingly
as
the
laws
of
their
physical
needs
direct
they
do
not
love
they
sell
instead
their
bodies
in
the
market
place
and
cry
out
that
man
shall
witness
their
virtue
because
they
had
had
the
joy
of
finding
one
buyer
instead
of
the
many
of
the
red
sisterhood
a
fierce
animalism
in
them
makes
them
cling
to
the
babe
at
their
breast
and
in
the
days
of
its
softness
and
loveliness
they
close
their
eyes
and
try
to
catch
again
an
old
fleeting
dream
of
their
girlhood
a
something
vague
shadowy
no
longer
a
part
of
them
brought
with
the
babe
out
of
the
infinite
having
passed
beyond
the
land
of
dreams
they
dwell
in
the
land
of
emotions
and
weep
over
the
bodies
of
unknown
dead
or
sit
under
the
eloquence
of
evangelists
shouting
of
heaven
and
of
hell
the
call
to
the
one
being
brother
to
the
call
of
the
other
crying
upon
the
troubled
air
of
hot
little
churches
where
hope
is
fighting
in
the
jaws
of
vulgarity
the
weight
of
my
sins
is
heavy
on
my
along
streets
they
go
lifting
heavy
eyes
to
peer
into
the
lives
of
others
and
to
get
a
morsel
to
roll
upon
their
heavy
tongues
having
fallen
upon
a
side
light
in
the
life
of
a
mary
underwood
they
return
to
it
again
and
again
as
a
dog
to
its
offal
something
touching
the
lives
of
such
as
walk
in
the
clean
air
dream
dreams
and
have
the
audacity
to
be
beautiful
beyond
the
beauty
of
animal
youth
maddens
them
and
they
cry
out
running
from
kitchen
door
to
kitchen
door
and
tearing
at
the
prize
like
a
starved
beast
who
has
found
a
carcass
let
but
earnest
women
found
a
movement
and
crowd
it
forward
to
the
day
when
it
smacks
of
success
and
gives
promise
of
the
fine
emotion
of
achievement
and
they
fall
upon
it
with
a
cry
having
hysteria
rather
than
reason
as
their
guiding
impulse
in
them
is
all
of
femininity
and
none
of
it
for
the
most
part
they
live
and
die
unseen
unknown
eating
rank
food
sleeping
overmuch
and
sitting
through
summer
afternoons
rocking
in
chairs
and
looking
at
people
passing
in
the
street
in
the
end
they
die
full
of
faith
hoping
for
a
life
to
come
sam
stood
upon
the
road
fearing
the
attacks
these
women
were
now
making
on
mary
underwood
the
moon
coming
up
threw
its
light
on
the
fields
that
lay
beside
the
road
and
brought
out
their
early
spring
nakedness
and
he
thought
them
dreary
and
hideous
like
the
faces
of
the
women
that
had
been
marching
through
his
mind
he
drew
his
overcoat
about
him
and
shivered
as
he
went
on
the
mud
splashing
him
and
the
raw
night
air
aggravating
the
dreariness
of
his
thoughts
he
tried
to
revert
to
the
assurance
of
the
days
before
his
mother
s
illness
and
to
get
again
the
strong
belief
in
his
own
destiny
that
had
kept
him
at
the
money
making
and
saving
and
had
urged
him
to
the
efforts
to
rise
above
the
level
of
the
man
who
bred
him
he
didn
t
succeed
the
feeling
of
age
that
had
settled
upon
him
in
the
midst
of
the
people
mourning
over
the
body
of
his
mother
came
back
and
turning
he
went
along
the
road
toward
the
town
saying
to
himself
i
will
go
and
talk
to
mary
while
he
waited
on
the
veranda
for
mary
to
open
the
door
he
decided
that
after
all
a
marriage
with
her
might
lead
to
happiness
the
half
spiritual
half
physical
love
of
woman
that
is
the
glory
and
mystery
of
youth
was
gone
from
him
he
thought
that
if
he
could
only
drive
from
her
presence
the
fear
of
the
faces
that
had
been
coming
and
going
in
his
own
mind
he
would
for
his
own
part
be
content
to
live
his
life
as
a
worker
and
money
maker
one
without
dreams
mary
underwood
came
to
the
door
wearing
the
same
heavy
long
coat
she
had
worn
on
that
other
night
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
sam
led
her
to
the
edge
of
the
veranda
he
looked
with
content
at
the
pine
trees
before
the
house
thinking
that
some
benign
influence
must
have
guided
the
hand
that
planted
them
there
to
stand
clothed
and
decent
amid
the
barrenness
of
the
land
at
the
end
of
winter
what
is
it
boy
asked
the
woman
and
her
voice
was
filled
with
anxiety
the
maternal
passion
again
glowing
in
her
had
for
days
coloured
all
her
thoughts
and
with
all
the
ardour
of
an
intense
nature
she
had
thrown
herself
into
her
love
of
sam
thinking
of
him
she
felt
in
fancy
the
pangs
of
birth
and
in
her
bed
at
night
relived
with
him
his
boyhood
in
the
town
and
built
again
her
plans
for
his
future
in
the
day
time
she
laughed
at
herself
and
said
tenderly
you
are
an
old
brutally
and
frankly
sam
told
her
of
the
thing
he
had
heard
on
the
station
platform
looking
past
her
at
the
pine
trees
and
gripping
the
veranda
rail
from
the
dead
land
there
came
again
the
smell
of
the
new
growth
as
it
had
come
to
him
on
the
road
before
the
revelation
at
the
railroad
station
something
kept
telling
me
not
to
go
away
he
said
it
must
have
been
in
the
air
this
thing
already
these
evil
crawling
things
were
at
work
oh
if
only
all
the
world
like
you
and
telfer
and
some
of
the
others
here
had
an
appreciation
of
the
sense
of
mary
underwood
laughed
quietly
i
was
more
than
half
right
when
in
the
old
days
i
dreamed
of
making
you
a
man
at
work
upon
the
things
of
the
mind
she
said
the
sense
of
privacy
indeed
what
a
fellow
you
have
become
john
telfer
s
method
was
better
than
my
own
he
has
given
you
the
knack
of
saying
things
with
a
sam
shook
his
head
here
is
something
that
can
not
be
faced
down
with
a
laugh
he
said
stoutly
here
is
something
at
you
it
is
tearing
at
you
it
has
got
to
be
met
even
now
women
are
waking
up
in
bed
and
turning
the
matter
over
in
their
minds
they
will
be
at
you
again
there
is
but
one
way
and
we
must
take
it
you
and
i
will
have
to
mary
looked
at
the
serious
new
lines
of
his
face
what
a
proposal
she
cried
on
an
impulse
she
began
singing
her
voice
fine
and
strong
running
through
the
quiet
night
he
rode
and
he
thought
of
her
red
red
lips
she
sang
and
laughed
again
you
should
come
like
that
she
said
and
then
you
poor
muddled
boy
don
t
you
know
that
i
am
your
new
mother
she
added
taking
hold
of
his
two
arms
and
turning
him
about
facing
her
don
t
be
absurd
i
don
t
want
a
husband
or
a
lover
i
want
a
son
of
my
own
and
i
have
found
him
i
adopted
you
here
in
this
house
that
night
when
you
came
to
me
sick
and
covered
with
mud
as
for
these
women
away
with
them
i
ll
face
them
down
i
did
it
once
before
and
i
ll
do
it
again
go
to
your
city
and
make
your
fight
here
in
caxton
it
is
a
woman
s
it
is
horrible
you
don
t
understand
sam
protested
a
grey
tired
look
came
into
mary
underwood
s
face
i
understand
she
said
i
have
been
on
that
battlefield
it
is
to
be
won
only
by
silence
and
tireless
waiting
your
very
effort
to
help
would
make
the
matter
the
woman
and
the
tall
boy
suddenly
become
a
man
stood
in
thought
she
was
thinking
of
the
end
toward
which
her
life
was
drifting
how
differently
she
had
planned
it
she
thought
of
the
college
in
massachusetts
and
of
the
men
and
women
walking
under
the
elm
trees
there
but
i
have
got
me
a
son
and
i
am
going
to
keep
him
she
said
aloud
putting
her
hand
on
sam
s
arm
very
serious
and
troubled
sam
went
down
the
gravel
path
toward
the
road
he
felt
there
was
something
cowardly
in
the
part
she
had
given
him
to
play
but
he
could
see
no
alternative
after
all
he
reflected
it
is
sensible
it
is
a
woman
s
half
way
to
the
road
he
stopped
and
running
back
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
gave
her
a
great
hug
little
mother
he
cried
and
kissed
her
upon
the
lips
and
she
watching
him
as
he
went
again
down
the
gravel
path
was
overcome
with
tenderness
she
went
to
the
back
of
the
porch
and
leaning
against
the
house
put
her
head
upon
her
arm
then
turning
and
smiling
through
her
tears
she
called
after
him
did
you
crack
their
heads
hard
boy
she
asked
from
mary
s
house
sam
went
to
his
own
on
the
gravel
path
an
idea
had
come
to
him
he
went
into
the
house
and
sitting
down
at
the
kitchen
table
with
pen
and
ink
began
writing
in
the
sleeping
room
back
of
the
parlour
he
could
hear
windy
snoring
he
wrote
carefully
erasing
and
writing
again
then
drawing
up
a
chair
before
the
kitchen
fire
he
read
over
and
over
what
he
had
written
and
putting
on
his
coat
went
through
the
dawn
to
the
house
of
tom
comstock
editor
of
the
and
roused
him
out
of
bed
i
ll
run
it
on
the
front
page
sam
and
it
won
t
cost
you
anything
comstock
promised
but
why
run
it
let
the
matter
i
shall
just
have
time
to
pack
and
get
the
morning
train
for
chicago
sam
thought
early
the
evening
before
telfer
wildman
and
freedom
smith
at
valmore
s
suggestion
had
made
a
visit
to
hunter
s
jewelry
store
for
an
hour
they
bargained
selected
rejected
and
swore
at
the
jeweller
when
the
choice
was
made
and
the
gift
lay
shining
against
white
cotton
in
a
box
on
the
counter
telfer
made
a
speech
i
will
talk
straight
to
that
boy
he
declared
laughing
i
am
not
going
to
spend
my
time
training
his
mind
for
money
making
and
then
have
him
fail
me
i
shall
tell
him
that
if
he
doesn
t
make
money
in
that
chicago
i
shall
come
and
take
the
watch
from
putting
the
gift
into
his
pocket
telfer
went
out
of
the
store
and
along
the
street
to
eleanor
s
shop
he
strutted
through
the
display
room
and
into
the
workshop
where
eleanor
sat
with
a
hat
on
her
knee
what
am
i
going
to
do
eleanor
he
demanded
standing
with
legs
spread
apart
and
frowning
down
upon
her
what
am
i
going
to
do
without
sam
a
boy
opened
the
shop
door
and
threw
a
newspaper
on
the
floor
the
boy
had
a
ringing
voice
and
quick
brown
eyes
telfer
went
again
through
the
display
room
touching
with
his
cane
the
posts
upon
which
hung
the
finished
hats
and
whistling
standing
before
the
shop
with
the
cane
hooked
upon
his
arm
he
rolled
a
cigarette
and
watched
the
boy
running
from
door
to
door
along
the
street
i
shall
have
to
be
adopting
a
new
son
he
said
musingly
after
sam
left
tom
comstock
stood
in
his
white
nightgown
and
the
statement
just
given
him
he
read
it
over
and
over
and
then
laying
it
on
the
kitchen
table
filled
and
lighted
a
corncob
pipe
a
draft
of
wind
blew
into
the
room
under
the
kitchen
door
chilling
his
thin
shanks
so
that
he
drew
his
bare
feet
one
after
the
other
up
behind
the
protective
walls
of
his
nightgown
on
the
night
of
my
mother
s
death
ran
the
statement
i
sat
in
the
kitchen
of
our
house
eating
my
supper
when
my
father
came
in
and
began
shouting
and
talking
loudly
disturbing
my
mother
who
was
asleep
i
put
my
hand
at
his
throat
and
squeezed
until
i
thought
he
was
dead
and
carried
him
around
the
house
and
threw
him
into
the
road
then
i
ran
to
the
house
of
mary
underwood
who
was
once
my
schoolteacher
and
told
her
what
i
had
done
she
took
me
home
awoke
john
telfer
and
then
went
to
look
for
the
body
of
my
father
who
was
not
dead
after
all
john
mcpherson
knows
this
is
true
if
he
can
be
made
to
tell
the
tom
comstock
shouted
to
his
wife
a
small
nervous
woman
with
red
cheeks
who
set
up
type
in
the
shop
did
her
own
housework
and
gathered
most
of
the
news
and
advertising
for
ain
t
that
a
slasher
he
asked
handing
her
the
statement
sam
had
written
well
it
ought
to
stop
the
mean
things
they
are
saying
about
mary
underwood
she
snapped
then
taking
the
glasses
from
her
nose
and
looking
at
tom
who
while
he
did
not
find
time
to
give
her
much
help
with
was
the
best
checker
player
in
caxton
and
had
once
been
to
a
state
tournament
of
experts
in
that
sport
she
added
poor
jane
mcpherson
to
have
had
a
son
like
sam
and
no
better
father
for
him
than
that
liar
windy
choked
him
eh
well
if
the
men
of
this
town
had
any
spunk
they
would
finish
the
book
ii
chapter
i
for
two
years
sam
lived
the
life
of
a
travelling
buyer
visiting
towns
in
indiana
illinois
and
iowa
and
making
deals
with
men
who
like
freedom
smith
bought
the
farmers
products
on
sundays
he
sat
in
chairs
before
country
hotels
and
walked
in
the
streets
of
strange
towns
or
getting
back
to
the
city
at
the
week
end
went
through
the
downtown
streets
and
among
the
crowds
in
the
parks
with
young
men
he
had
met
on
the
road
from
time
to
time
he
went
to
caxton
and
sat
for
an
hour
with
the
men
in
wildman
s
stealing
away
later
for
an
evening
with
mary
underwood
in
the
store
he
heard
news
of
windy
who
was
laying
close
siege
to
the
farmer
s
widow
he
later
married
and
who
seldom
appeared
in
caxton
in
the
store
he
saw
the
boy
with
freckles
on
his
nose
the
same
john
telfer
had
watched
running
along
main
street
on
the
night
when
he
went
to
show
eleanor
the
gold
watch
bought
for
sam
and
who
sat
now
on
the
cracker
barrel
in
the
store
and
later
went
with
telfer
to
dodge
the
swinging
cane
and
listen
to
the
eloquence
poured
out
on
the
night
air
telfer
had
not
got
the
chance
to
stand
with
a
crowd
about
him
at
the
railroad
station
and
make
a
parting
speech
to
sam
and
in
secret
he
resented
the
loss
of
that
opportunity
after
turning
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
and
thinking
of
many
fine
flourishes
and
ringing
periods
to
give
colour
to
the
speech
he
had
been
compelled
to
send
the
gift
by
mail
and
sam
while
the
gift
had
touched
him
deeply
and
had
brought
back
to
his
mind
the
essential
solid
goodness
of
the
town
amid
the
cornfields
so
that
he
lost
much
of
the
bitterness
aroused
by
the
attack
upon
mary
underwood
had
been
able
to
make
but
a
tame
and
halting
reply
to
the
four
in
his
room
in
chicago
he
had
spent
an
evening
writing
and
rewriting
putting
in
and
taking
out
flourishes
and
had
ended
by
sending
a
brief
line
of
thanks
valmore
whose
affection
for
the
boy
had
been
a
slow
growth
and
who
now
that
he
was
gone
missed
him
more
than
the
others
once
spoke
to
freedom
smith
of
the
change
that
had
come
over
young
mcpherson
freedom
sat
in
the
wide
old
phaeton
in
the
road
before
valmore
s
shop
as
the
blacksmith
walked
around
the
grey
mare
lifting
her
feet
and
looking
at
the
shoes
what
has
happened
to
sam
he
has
changed
so
much
he
asked
dropping
a
foot
of
the
mare
and
coming
to
lean
upon
the
front
wheel
already
the
city
has
changed
him
he
added
regretfully
freedom
took
a
match
from
his
pocket
and
lighted
the
short
black
pipe
he
bites
off
his
words
continued
valmore
he
sits
for
an
hour
in
the
store
and
then
goes
away
and
doesn
t
come
back
to
say
when
he
leaves
town
what
has
got
into
him
freedom
gathered
up
the
reins
and
spat
over
the
dashboard
into
the
dust
of
the
road
a
dog
idling
in
the
street
jumped
as
though
a
stone
had
been
hurled
at
him
if
you
had
something
he
wanted
to
buy
you
would
find
he
talked
all
right
he
exploded
he
skins
me
out
of
my
eyeteeth
every
time
he
comes
to
town
and
then
gives
me
a
cigar
wrapped
in
tinfoil
to
make
me
like
for
some
months
after
his
hurried
departure
from
caxton
the
changing
hurrying
life
of
the
city
profoundly
interested
the
tall
strong
boy
from
the
iowa
village
who
had
the
cold
quick
business
stroke
of
the
combined
with
an
unusually
active
interest
in
the
problems
of
life
and
of
living
instinctively
he
looked
upon
business
as
a
great
game
in
which
many
men
sat
and
in
which
the
capable
quiet
ones
waited
patiently
until
a
certain
moment
and
then
pounced
upon
what
they
would
possess
with
the
quickness
and
accuracy
of
a
beast
at
the
kill
they
pounced
and
sam
felt
that
he
had
that
stroke
and
in
his
deals
with
country
buyers
used
it
ruthlessly
he
knew
the
vague
uncertain
look
that
came
into
the
eyes
of
unsuccessful
business
men
at
critical
moments
and
watched
for
it
and
took
advantage
of
it
as
a
successful
prize
fighter
watches
for
a
similar
vague
uncertain
look
in
the
eyes
of
an
opponent
he
had
found
his
work
and
had
the
assurance
and
the
confidence
that
comes
with
that
discovery
the
stroke
that
he
saw
in
the
hand
of
the
successful
business
men
about
him
is
the
stroke
also
of
the
master
painter
scientist
actor
singer
prize
fighter
it
was
the
hand
of
whistler
balzac
agassiz
and
terry
mcgovern
the
sense
of
it
had
been
in
him
when
as
a
boy
he
watched
the
totals
grow
in
the
yellow
bankbook
and
now
and
then
he
recognised
it
in
telfer
talking
on
a
country
road
in
the
city
where
men
of
wealth
and
power
in
affairs
rubbed
elbows
with
him
in
the
street
cars
and
walked
past
him
in
hotel
lobbies
he
watched
and
waited
saying
to
himself
i
also
will
be
such
a
sam
had
not
lost
the
vision
that
had
come
to
him
when
as
a
boy
he
walked
on
the
road
and
listened
to
the
talk
of
telfer
but
he
now
thought
of
himself
as
one
who
had
not
only
a
hunger
for
achievement
but
also
a
knowledge
of
where
to
look
for
it
at
times
he
had
stirring
dreams
of
vast
work
to
be
done
by
his
hand
that
made
the
blood
race
in
him
but
for
the
most
part
he
went
his
way
quietly
making
friends
looking
about
him
keeping
his
mind
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
making
deals
during
his
first
year
in
the
city
he
lived
in
the
house
of
an
family
named
pergrin
that
had
been
in
chicago
for
several
years
but
that
still
continued
to
send
its
members
one
at
a
time
to
spend
summer
vacations
in
the
iowa
village
to
these
people
he
carried
letters
handed
him
during
the
month
after
his
mother
s
death
and
letters
regarding
him
had
come
to
them
from
caxton
in
the
house
where
eight
people
sat
down
to
dinner
only
three
besides
himself
were
but
thoughts
and
talk
of
the
town
pervaded
the
house
and
crept
into
every
conversation
i
was
thinking
of
old
john
moore
does
he
still
drive
that
team
of
black
ponies
the
housekeeping
sister
a
woman
of
thirty
would
ask
of
sam
at
the
dinner
table
breaking
in
on
a
conversation
of
baseball
or
a
tale
by
one
of
the
boarders
of
a
new
office
building
to
be
erected
in
the
loop
no
he
don
t
jake
pergrin
a
fat
bachelor
of
forty
who
was
foreman
in
a
machine
shop
and
the
man
of
the
house
would
answer
so
long
had
jake
been
the
final
authority
in
the
house
on
affairs
touching
caxton
that
he
looked
upon
sam
as
an
intruder
john
told
me
last
summer
when
i
was
home
that
he
intended
to
sell
the
blacks
and
buy
mules
he
would
add
looking
at
the
youth
challengingly
the
pergrin
family
was
in
fact
upon
foreign
soil
living
amid
the
roar
and
bustle
of
chicago
s
vast
west
side
it
still
turned
with
hungry
heart
toward
the
place
of
corn
and
of
steers
and
wished
that
work
for
jake
its
mainstay
could
be
found
in
that
paradise
jake
pergrin
a
man
with
a
paunch
stubby
moustache
and
a
dark
line
of
machine
oil
encircling
his
finger
nails
so
that
they
stood
forth
separately
like
formal
flower
beds
at
the
edge
of
a
lawn
worked
industriously
from
monday
morning
until
saturday
night
going
to
bed
at
nine
o
clock
and
until
that
hour
wandering
whistling
from
room
to
room
through
the
house
in
a
pair
of
worn
carpet
slippers
or
sitting
in
his
room
practising
on
a
violin
on
saturday
evening
the
habits
formed
in
his
caxton
days
being
strong
in
him
he
came
home
with
his
pay
in
his
pocket
settled
with
the
two
sisters
for
the
week
s
living
sat
down
to
dinner
neatly
shaved
and
combed
and
then
disappeared
upon
the
troubled
waters
of
the
town
late
on
sunday
evening
he
with
empty
pockets
unsteady
step
eyes
and
a
noisy
attempt
at
unconcern
to
hurry
upstairs
and
crawl
into
bed
in
preparation
for
another
week
of
toil
and
respectability
the
man
had
a
certain
rabelaisian
sense
of
humour
and
kept
score
of
the
new
ladies
met
on
his
weekly
flights
by
pencil
marks
upon
his
bedroom
wall
he
once
took
sam
upstairs
to
show
his
record
a
row
of
them
ran
half
around
the
room
besides
the
bachelor
there
was
a
sister
a
tall
gaunt
woman
of
who
taught
school
and
the
housekeeper
thirty
mild
and
blessed
with
a
remarkably
sweet
speaking
voice
then
there
was
a
medical
student
in
the
front
room
sam
in
an
alcove
off
the
hall
a
woman
stenographer
whom
jake
called
marie
antoinette
and
a
buyer
from
a
wholesale
house
with
a
vivacious
little
southern
wife
the
women
in
the
pergrin
house
seemed
to
sam
tremendously
concerned
about
their
health
and
each
evening
talked
of
the
matter
he
thought
more
than
his
mother
had
talked
during
her
illness
while
sam
lived
with
them
they
were
all
under
the
influence
of
a
strange
sort
of
faith
healer
and
took
what
they
called
health
suggestion
treatments
twice
each
week
the
faith
healer
came
to
the
house
laid
his
hands
upon
their
backs
and
took
their
money
the
treatment
afforded
jake
a
source
of
amusement
and
in
the
evening
he
went
through
the
house
putting
his
hands
upon
the
backs
of
the
women
and
demanding
money
from
them
but
the
buyer
s
wife
who
for
years
had
coughed
at
night
slept
peacefully
after
some
weeks
of
the
treatment
and
the
cough
did
not
return
while
sam
remained
in
the
house
in
the
house
sam
had
a
standing
glowing
tales
of
his
shrewdness
in
business
his
untiring
industry
and
the
size
of
his
bank
account
had
preceded
him
from
caxton
and
these
tales
the
pergrins
in
their
loyalty
to
the
town
and
to
all
the
products
of
the
town
did
not
allow
to
shrink
in
the
the
housekeeping
sister
a
kindly
woman
became
fond
of
sam
and
in
his
absence
would
boast
of
him
to
chance
callers
or
to
the
boarders
gathered
in
the
living
room
in
the
evening
she
it
was
who
laid
the
foundation
of
the
medical
student
s
belief
that
sam
was
a
kind
of
genius
in
money
matters
a
belief
that
enabled
him
later
to
make
a
successful
assault
upon
a
legacy
which
came
to
that
young
man
frank
eckardt
the
medical
student
sam
took
as
a
friend
on
sunday
afternoons
they
went
to
walk
in
the
streets
or
taking
two
girl
friends
of
frank
s
who
were
also
students
at
the
medical
school
on
their
arms
they
went
to
the
park
and
sat
upon
benches
under
the
trees
for
one
of
these
young
women
sam
conceived
a
regard
that
approached
tenderness
sunday
after
sunday
he
spent
with
her
and
once
walking
through
the
park
on
an
evening
in
the
late
fall
the
dry
brown
leaves
rustling
under
their
feet
and
the
sun
going
down
in
red
splendour
before
their
eyes
he
took
her
hand
and
walked
in
silence
feeling
tremendously
alive
and
vital
as
he
had
felt
on
that
other
night
walking
under
the
trees
of
caxton
with
the
daughter
of
banker
walker
that
nothing
came
of
the
affair
and
that
after
a
time
he
did
not
see
the
girl
again
was
due
he
thought
to
his
own
growing
interest
in
money
making
and
to
the
fact
that
there
was
in
her
as
in
frank
eckardt
a
blind
devotion
to
something
that
he
could
not
himself
understand
once
he
had
a
talk
with
eckardt
of
the
matter
she
is
fine
and
purposeful
like
a
woman
i
knew
in
my
home
town
he
said
thinking
of
eleanor
telfer
but
she
will
not
talk
to
me
of
her
work
as
sometimes
she
talks
to
you
i
want
her
to
talk
there
is
something
about
her
that
i
do
not
understand
and
that
i
want
to
understand
i
think
that
she
likes
me
and
once
or
twice
i
have
thought
she
would
not
greatly
mind
my
making
love
to
her
but
i
do
not
understand
her
just
the
one
day
in
the
office
of
the
company
for
which
he
worked
sam
became
acquainted
with
a
young
advertising
man
named
jack
prince
a
brisk
very
much
alive
young
fellow
who
made
money
rapidly
spent
it
lavishly
and
had
friends
and
acquaintances
in
every
office
every
hotel
lobby
every
bar
room
and
restaurant
in
the
section
of
the
city
the
chance
acquaintance
rapidly
grew
into
friendship
the
clever
witty
prince
made
a
kind
of
hero
of
sam
admiring
his
reserve
and
good
sense
and
boasting
of
him
far
and
wide
through
the
town
with
prince
sam
occasionally
went
on
mild
carouses
and
once
in
the
midst
of
thousands
of
people
sitting
about
tables
and
drinking
beer
at
the
coliseum
on
wabash
avenue
he
and
prince
got
into
a
fight
with
two
waiters
prince
declaring
he
had
been
cheated
and
sam
although
he
thought
his
friend
in
the
wrong
striking
out
with
his
fist
and
dragging
prince
through
the
door
and
into
a
passing
street
car
in
time
to
avoid
a
rush
of
other
waiters
hurrying
to
the
aid
of
the
one
who
lay
dazed
and
sputtering
on
the
sawdust
floor
after
these
evenings
of
carousal
carried
on
with
jack
prince
and
with
young
men
met
on
trains
and
about
country
hotels
sam
spent
hour
after
hour
walking
about
town
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
and
getting
his
own
impressions
of
what
he
saw
in
the
affairs
with
the
young
men
he
played
for
the
most
part
a
passive
rôle
going
with
them
from
place
to
place
and
drinking
until
they
became
loud
and
boisterous
or
morose
and
quarrelsome
and
then
slipping
away
to
his
own
room
amused
or
irritated
as
the
circumstances
or
the
temperament
of
his
companions
had
made
or
marred
the
joviality
of
the
evening
on
his
nights
alone
he
put
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
walked
for
endless
miles
through
the
lighted
streets
getting
in
a
dim
way
a
realisation
of
the
hugeness
of
life
all
of
the
faces
going
past
him
the
women
in
their
furs
the
young
men
with
cigars
in
their
mouths
going
to
the
theatres
the
bald
old
men
with
watery
eyes
the
boys
with
bundles
of
newspapers
under
their
arms
and
the
slim
prostitutes
lurking
in
the
hallways
should
have
interested
him
deeply
in
his
youth
and
with
the
pride
of
sleeping
power
in
him
he
saw
them
only
as
so
many
individuals
that
might
some
day
test
their
ability
against
his
own
and
if
he
peered
at
them
closely
and
marked
down
face
after
face
in
the
crowds
it
was
as
a
sitter
in
the
great
game
of
business
that
he
looked
exercising
his
mind
by
imagining
this
or
that
one
arrayed
against
him
in
deals
and
planning
the
method
by
which
he
would
win
in
the
imaginary
struggle
there
was
at
that
time
in
chicago
a
place
to
be
reached
by
a
bridge
above
the
illinois
central
railroad
track
that
sam
sometimes
visited
on
stormy
nights
to
watch
the
lake
lashed
by
the
wind
great
masses
of
water
moving
swiftly
and
silently
broke
with
a
roar
against
wooden
piles
backed
by
hills
of
stone
and
earth
and
the
spray
from
the
broken
waves
fell
upon
sam
s
face
and
on
winter
nights
froze
on
his
coat
he
had
learned
to
smoke
and
leaning
upon
the
railing
of
the
bridge
would
stand
for
hours
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
looking
at
the
moving
water
filled
with
awe
and
admiration
of
the
silent
power
of
it
one
night
in
september
when
he
was
walking
alone
in
the
streets
an
incident
happened
that
showed
him
also
a
silent
power
within
himself
a
power
that
startled
and
for
the
moment
frightened
him
walking
into
a
little
street
back
of
dearborn
he
was
suddenly
aware
of
the
faces
of
women
looking
out
at
him
through
small
square
windows
cut
in
the
fronts
of
the
houses
here
and
there
before
and
behind
him
were
the
faces
voices
called
smiles
invited
hands
beckoned
up
and
down
the
street
went
men
looking
at
the
sidewalk
their
coats
turned
up
about
their
necks
their
hats
pulled
down
over
their
eyes
they
looked
at
the
faces
of
the
women
pressed
against
the
little
squares
of
glass
and
then
turning
suddenly
sprang
in
at
the
doors
of
the
houses
as
if
pursued
among
the
walkers
on
the
sidewalk
were
old
men
men
in
shabby
coats
whose
feet
scuffled
as
they
hurried
along
and
young
boys
with
the
pink
of
virtue
in
their
cheeks
in
the
air
was
lust
heavy
and
hideous
it
got
into
sam
s
brain
and
he
stood
hesitating
and
uncertain
startled
nerveless
afraid
he
remembered
a
story
he
had
once
heard
from
john
telfer
a
story
of
the
disease
and
death
that
lurks
in
the
little
side
streets
of
cities
and
ran
into
van
buren
street
and
from
that
into
lighted
state
he
climbed
up
the
stairway
of
the
elevated
railroad
and
jumping
on
the
first
train
went
away
south
to
walk
for
hours
on
a
gravel
roadway
at
the
edge
of
the
lake
in
jackson
park
the
wind
from
the
lake
and
the
laughter
and
talk
of
people
passing
under
the
lights
cooled
the
fever
in
him
as
once
it
had
been
cooled
by
the
eloquence
of
john
telfer
walking
on
the
road
near
caxton
and
with
his
voice
marshalling
the
armies
of
the
standing
corn
into
sam
s
mind
came
a
picture
of
the
cold
silent
water
moving
in
great
masses
under
the
night
sky
and
he
thought
that
in
the
world
of
men
there
was
a
force
as
resistless
as
little
understood
as
little
talked
of
moving
always
forward
silent
powerful
the
force
of
sex
he
wondered
how
the
force
would
be
broken
in
his
own
case
against
what
breakwater
it
would
spend
itself
at
midnight
he
went
home
across
the
city
and
crept
into
his
alcove
in
the
pergrin
house
puzzled
and
for
the
time
utterly
tired
in
his
bed
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
resolutely
closing
his
eyes
tried
to
sleep
there
are
things
not
to
be
understood
he
told
himself
to
live
decently
is
a
matter
of
good
sense
i
will
keep
thinking
of
what
i
want
to
do
and
not
go
into
such
a
place
one
day
when
he
had
been
in
chicago
two
years
there
happened
an
incident
of
another
sort
an
incident
so
grotesque
so
so
full
of
youth
that
for
days
after
it
happened
he
thought
of
it
with
delight
and
walked
in
the
streets
or
sat
in
a
passenger
train
laughing
joyfully
at
the
remembrance
of
some
new
detail
of
the
affair
sam
who
was
the
son
of
windy
mcpherson
and
who
had
more
than
once
ruthlessly
condemned
all
men
who
put
liquor
into
their
mouths
got
drunk
and
for
eighteen
hours
went
shouting
poetry
singing
songs
and
yelling
at
the
stars
like
a
wood
god
on
the
bend
late
on
an
afternoon
in
the
early
spring
he
sat
with
jack
prince
in
dejonge
s
restaurant
in
monroe
street
prince
his
watch
lying
before
him
on
the
table
and
the
thin
stem
of
a
wine
glass
between
his
fingers
talked
to
sam
of
the
man
for
whom
they
had
been
waiting
a
half
hour
he
will
be
late
of
course
he
exclaimed
refilling
sam
s
glass
the
man
was
never
on
time
in
his
life
to
keep
an
appointment
promptly
would
take
something
from
him
it
would
be
like
the
bloom
of
youth
gone
from
the
cheeks
of
a
sam
had
already
seen
the
man
for
whom
they
waited
he
was
small
and
with
a
little
wrinkled
face
a
huge
nose
and
a
pair
of
eyeglasses
that
hooked
over
his
ears
sam
had
seen
him
in
a
michigan
avenue
club
with
prince
solemnly
pitching
silver
dollars
at
a
chalk
mark
on
the
floor
with
a
group
of
serious
old
men
they
are
the
crowd
that
have
just
put
through
the
big
deal
in
kansas
oil
stock
and
the
little
one
is
morris
who
handled
the
publicity
for
them
prince
had
explained
later
when
they
were
walking
down
michigan
avenue
prince
talked
at
length
of
morris
whom
he
admired
immensely
he
is
the
best
advertising
and
publicity
man
in
america
he
declared
he
isn
t
a
as
i
am
and
does
not
make
as
much
money
but
he
can
take
another
man
s
ideas
and
express
them
so
simply
and
forcibly
that
they
tell
the
man
s
story
better
than
he
knew
it
himself
and
that
s
all
there
is
to
he
began
laughing
it
is
funny
to
think
of
it
tom
morris
will
do
a
job
of
work
and
the
man
for
whom
he
does
it
will
swear
that
he
did
it
himself
that
every
pat
phrase
on
the
printed
page
tom
has
turned
out
is
one
of
his
own
he
will
howl
like
a
beast
at
paying
tom
s
bill
and
then
the
next
time
he
will
try
to
do
the
job
himself
and
make
a
hopeless
muddle
of
it
so
that
he
has
to
send
for
tom
only
to
see
the
trick
done
over
again
like
shelling
corn
off
the
cob
the
best
men
in
chicago
send
for
into
the
restaurant
came
tom
morris
bearing
under
his
arm
a
huge
pasteboard
portfolio
he
seemed
hurried
and
nervous
i
am
on
my
way
to
the
office
of
the
international
biscuit
turning
machine
company
he
explained
to
prince
i
can
t
stop
at
all
i
have
here
the
layout
of
a
circular
designed
to
push
on
to
the
market
some
more
of
that
common
stock
of
theirs
that
hasn
t
paid
a
dividend
for
ten
thrusting
out
his
hand
prince
dragged
morris
into
a
chair
never
mind
the
biscuit
machine
people
and
their
stock
he
commanded
they
will
always
have
common
stock
to
sell
it
is
inexhaustible
i
want
you
to
meet
mcpherson
here
who
will
some
day
have
something
big
for
you
to
help
him
morris
reached
across
the
table
and
took
sam
s
hand
his
own
was
small
and
soft
like
that
of
a
woman
i
am
worked
to
death
he
complained
i
have
my
eye
on
a
chicken
farm
in
indiana
i
am
going
down
there
to
for
an
hour
the
three
men
sat
in
the
restaurant
while
prince
talked
of
a
place
in
wisconsin
where
the
fish
should
be
biting
a
man
has
told
me
of
the
place
twenty
times
he
declared
i
am
sure
i
could
find
it
on
a
railroad
folder
i
have
never
been
fishing
nor
have
you
and
sam
here
comes
from
a
place
to
which
they
carry
water
in
wagons
over
the
the
little
man
who
had
been
drinking
copiously
of
the
wine
looked
from
prince
to
sam
from
time
to
time
he
took
off
his
glasses
and
wiped
them
with
a
handkerchief
i
don
t
understand
your
being
in
such
society
he
announced
you
have
the
solid
substantial
look
of
a
man
prince
here
will
get
nowhere
he
is
honest
sells
wind
and
his
charming
society
and
spends
the
money
that
he
gets
instead
of
marrying
and
putting
it
in
his
wife
s
prince
arose
it
is
useless
to
waste
time
in
persiflage
he
began
and
then
turning
to
sam
there
is
a
place
in
wisconsin
he
said
uncertainly
morris
picked
up
the
portfolio
and
with
a
grotesque
effort
at
steadiness
started
for
the
door
followed
by
prince
and
sam
walking
with
wavering
steps
in
the
street
prince
took
the
portfolio
out
of
the
little
man
s
hand
let
your
mother
carry
it
tommy
he
said
shaking
his
finger
under
morris
s
nose
he
began
singing
a
lullaby
when
the
bough
bends
the
cradle
will
the
three
men
walked
out
of
monroe
and
into
state
street
sam
s
head
feeling
strangely
light
the
buildings
along
the
street
reeled
against
the
sky
a
sudden
fierce
longing
for
wild
adventure
seized
him
on
a
corner
morris
stopped
took
the
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
again
wiped
his
glasses
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
see
clearly
he
said
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
bottom
of
that
last
glass
of
wine
i
saw
three
of
us
in
a
cab
with
a
basket
of
life
oil
on
the
seat
between
us
going
to
the
station
to
catch
the
train
for
that
place
jack
s
friend
told
fish
lies
the
next
eighteen
hours
opened
up
a
new
world
to
sam
with
the
fumes
of
liquor
rising
in
his
brain
he
rode
for
two
hours
on
a
train
tramped
in
the
darkness
along
dusty
roads
and
building
a
bonfire
in
a
woods
danced
in
the
light
of
it
upon
the
grass
holding
the
hands
of
prince
and
the
little
man
with
the
wrinkled
face
solemnly
he
stood
upon
a
stump
at
the
edge
of
a
wheatfield
and
recited
poe
s
helen
taking
on
the
voice
the
gestures
and
even
the
habit
of
spreading
his
legs
apart
of
john
telfer
and
then
overdoing
the
last
he
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
stump
and
morris
coming
forward
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand
said
fill
the
lamp
man
the
light
of
reason
has
gone
from
the
bonfire
in
the
woods
and
sam
s
recital
from
the
stump
the
three
friends
emerged
again
upon
the
road
and
a
belated
farmer
driving
home
half
asleep
on
the
seat
of
his
wagon
caught
their
attention
with
the
skill
of
an
indian
boy
the
diminutive
morris
sprang
upon
the
wagon
and
thrust
a
ten
dollar
bill
into
the
farmer
s
hand
lead
us
o
man
of
the
soil
he
shouted
lead
us
to
a
gilded
palace
of
sin
take
us
to
a
saloon
the
life
oil
gets
low
in
the
can
beyond
the
long
jolting
ride
in
the
wagon
sam
never
became
quite
clear
in
his
mind
ran
vague
notions
of
a
wild
carousal
in
a
country
tavern
of
himself
acting
as
bartender
and
a
huge
woman
rushing
here
and
there
under
the
direction
of
a
tiny
man
dragging
reluctant
rustics
to
the
bar
and
commanding
them
to
keep
on
drinking
the
beer
that
sam
drew
until
the
last
of
the
ten
dollars
given
to
the
man
of
the
wagon
should
have
gone
into
her
cash
drawer
also
he
thought
that
jack
prince
had
put
a
chair
upon
the
bar
and
that
he
sat
on
it
explaining
to
the
hurrying
drawer
of
beer
that
although
the
egyptian
kings
had
built
great
pyramids
to
celebrate
themselves
they
never
built
anything
more
gigantic
than
the
jag
tom
morris
was
building
among
the
farm
hands
in
the
room
later
sam
thought
that
he
and
jack
prince
tried
to
sleep
under
a
pile
of
grain
sacks
in
a
shed
and
that
morris
came
to
them
weeping
because
every
one
in
the
world
was
asleep
and
most
of
them
lying
under
tables
and
then
his
head
clearing
sam
found
himself
with
the
two
others
walking
again
upon
the
dusty
road
in
the
dawn
and
singing
songs
on
the
train
with
the
help
of
a
negro
porter
the
three
men
tried
to
efface
the
dust
and
the
stains
of
the
wild
night
the
pasteboard
portfolio
containing
the
circular
for
the
biscuit
machine
company
was
still
under
jack
prince
s
arm
and
the
little
man
wiping
and
his
glasses
peered
at
sam
did
you
come
with
us
or
are
you
a
child
we
have
adopted
here
in
these
parts
he
asked
chapter
ii
it
was
a
wonderful
place
that
south
water
street
in
chicago
where
sam
came
to
make
his
business
start
in
the
city
and
it
was
proof
of
the
dry
unresponsiveness
in
him
that
he
did
not
sense
more
fully
its
meaning
and
its
message
all
day
the
food
stuff
of
a
vast
city
flowed
through
the
narrow
streets
teamsters
from
the
tops
of
high
piled
wagons
bawled
at
scurrying
pedestrians
on
the
sidewalks
in
boxes
bags
and
barrels
lay
oranges
from
florida
and
california
figs
from
arabia
bananas
from
jamaica
nuts
from
the
hills
of
spain
and
the
plains
of
africa
cabbages
from
ohio
beans
from
michigan
corn
and
potatoes
from
iowa
in
december
men
hurried
through
the
forests
of
northern
michigan
gathering
christmas
trees
that
found
their
way
to
warm
firesides
through
the
street
and
summer
and
winter
a
million
hens
laid
the
eggs
that
were
gathered
there
and
the
cattle
on
a
thousand
hills
sent
their
yellow
butter
fat
packed
in
tubs
and
piled
upon
trucks
to
add
to
the
confusion
into
this
street
sam
walked
thinking
little
of
the
wonder
of
these
things
and
thinking
haltingly
getting
his
sense
of
the
bigness
of
it
in
dollars
and
cents
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
commission
house
for
which
he
was
to
work
strong
well
clad
able
and
efficient
he
looked
through
the
streets
seeing
and
hearing
the
hurry
and
the
roar
and
the
shouting
of
voices
and
then
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
went
inside
in
his
brain
was
an
unexpressed
thought
as
the
old
norse
marauders
looked
at
the
cities
sitting
in
their
splendour
on
the
mediterranean
so
looked
he
what
loot
a
voice
within
him
said
and
his
brain
began
devising
methods
by
which
he
should
get
his
share
of
it
years
later
when
sam
was
a
man
of
big
affairs
he
drove
one
day
in
a
carriage
through
the
streets
and
turning
to
his
companion
a
dignified
boston
man
who
sat
beside
him
said
i
worked
here
once
and
used
to
sit
on
a
barrel
of
apples
at
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
thinking
how
clever
i
was
to
make
more
money
in
one
month
than
the
man
who
raised
the
apples
made
in
a
the
boston
man
stirred
by
the
sight
of
so
much
foodstuff
and
moved
to
epigram
by
his
mood
looked
up
and
down
the
street
the
foodstuff
of
an
empire
rattling
o
er
the
stones
he
said
i
should
have
made
more
money
here
answered
sam
dryly
the
commission
firm
for
which
sam
worked
was
a
partnership
not
a
corporation
and
was
owned
by
two
brothers
of
the
two
sam
thought
that
the
elder
a
tall
bald
man
with
a
long
narrow
face
and
a
suave
manner
was
the
real
master
and
represented
most
of
the
ability
in
the
partnership
he
was
oily
silent
tireless
all
day
he
went
in
and
out
of
the
office
and
warehouses
and
up
and
down
the
crowded
street
sucking
nervously
at
an
unlighted
cigar
he
was
a
great
worker
in
a
suburban
church
but
a
shrewd
and
sam
suspected
an
unscrupulous
business
man
occasionally
the
minister
or
some
of
the
women
of
the
suburban
church
came
into
the
office
to
talk
with
him
and
sam
was
amused
at
the
thought
that
narrow
face
when
he
talked
of
the
affairs
of
the
church
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
minister
of
the
church
in
caxton
the
other
brother
was
a
far
different
sort
and
in
business
sam
thought
a
much
inferior
man
he
was
a
heavy
man
of
about
thirty
who
sat
in
the
office
dictating
letters
and
who
stayed
out
two
or
three
hours
to
lunch
he
sent
out
letters
signed
by
him
on
the
firm
s
stationery
with
the
title
of
general
manager
and
narrow
face
let
him
do
it
broad
shoulders
had
been
educated
in
new
england
and
even
after
several
years
away
from
his
college
seemed
more
interested
in
it
than
in
the
welfare
of
the
business
for
a
month
or
more
in
the
spring
he
took
most
of
the
time
of
one
of
the
two
stenographers
employed
by
the
firm
writing
letters
to
graduates
of
chicago
high
schools
to
induce
them
to
go
east
to
finish
their
education
and
when
a
graduate
of
the
college
came
to
chicago
seeking
employment
he
closed
his
desk
and
spent
entire
days
going
from
place
to
place
introducing
urging
recommending
sam
noticed
however
that
when
the
firm
employed
a
new
man
in
their
own
office
or
on
the
road
it
was
who
chose
the
man
had
been
a
famous
football
player
in
his
day
and
wore
an
iron
brace
on
his
leg
the
offices
like
most
of
the
offices
on
the
street
were
dark
and
narrow
and
smelled
of
decaying
vegetables
and
rancid
butter
noisy
greek
and
italian
hucksters
wrangled
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
and
among
these
went
hurrying
about
making
deals
in
south
water
street
sam
did
well
multiplying
his
hundred
dollars
by
ten
during
the
three
years
that
he
stayed
there
or
went
out
from
there
to
towns
and
cities
directing
a
part
of
the
great
flowing
river
of
foodstuff
through
his
firm
s
front
door
with
almost
his
first
day
on
the
street
he
began
seeing
on
all
sides
of
him
opportunity
for
gain
and
set
himself
industriously
at
work
to
get
his
hand
upon
money
with
which
to
take
advantage
of
the
chances
that
he
thought
lay
so
invitingly
about
within
a
year
he
had
made
much
progress
from
a
woman
on
wabash
avenue
he
got
six
thousand
dollars
and
he
planned
and
executed
a
coup
that
gave
him
the
use
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
that
had
come
as
a
legacy
to
his
friend
the
medical
student
who
lived
at
the
pergrin
house
sam
had
eggs
and
apples
lying
in
warehouse
against
a
rise
game
smuggled
across
the
state
line
from
michigan
and
wisconsin
lay
frozen
in
cold
storage
tagged
with
his
name
and
ready
to
be
sold
at
a
long
profit
to
hotels
and
fashionable
restaurants
and
there
were
even
secret
bushels
of
corn
and
wheat
lying
in
other
warehouses
along
the
chicago
river
ready
to
be
thrown
on
the
market
at
a
word
from
him
or
the
margins
by
which
he
kept
his
hold
on
the
stuff
not
being
forthcoming
at
a
word
from
a
lasalle
street
broker
getting
the
twenty
thousand
dollars
out
of
the
hands
of
the
medical
student
was
a
turning
point
in
sam
s
life
sunday
after
sunday
he
walked
with
eckardt
in
the
streets
or
loitered
with
him
in
the
parks
thinking
of
the
money
lying
idle
in
the
bank
and
of
the
deals
he
might
be
turning
with
it
in
the
street
or
on
the
road
daily
he
saw
more
clearly
the
power
of
cash
other
commission
merchants
along
south
water
street
came
running
into
the
office
of
his
firm
with
tense
anxious
faces
asking
to
help
them
over
rough
spots
in
the
day
s
trading
who
had
no
business
ability
but
who
had
married
a
rich
woman
went
on
month
after
month
taking
half
the
profits
brought
in
by
the
ability
of
his
tall
shrewd
brother
and
who
had
taken
a
liking
for
sam
and
who
occasionally
stopped
for
a
word
with
him
spoke
of
the
matter
often
and
eloquently
spend
your
time
with
no
one
who
hasn
t
money
to
help
you
he
said
on
the
road
look
for
the
men
with
money
and
then
try
to
get
it
that
s
all
there
is
to
business
and
then
looking
across
to
the
desk
of
his
brother
he
would
add
i
would
kick
half
the
men
in
business
out
of
it
if
i
could
but
i
myself
must
dance
to
the
tune
that
money
one
day
sam
went
to
the
office
of
an
attorney
named
webster
whose
reputation
for
the
shrewd
drawing
of
contracts
had
come
to
him
from
i
want
a
contract
drawn
that
will
give
me
absolute
control
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
with
no
risk
on
my
part
if
i
lose
the
money
and
no
promise
to
pay
more
than
seven
per
cent
if
i
do
not
lose
he
said
the
attorney
a
slender
man
with
a
swarthy
skin
and
black
hair
put
his
hands
on
the
desk
before
him
and
looked
at
the
tall
young
man
what
collateral
he
asked
sam
shook
his
head
can
you
draw
such
a
contract
that
will
be
legal
and
what
will
it
cost
me
he
asked
the
lawyer
laughed
good
naturedly
i
can
draw
it
of
course
why
not
sam
taking
a
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
counted
the
amount
upon
the
table
who
are
you
anyway
asked
webster
if
you
can
get
twenty
thousand
and
without
collateral
you
re
worth
knowing
i
might
be
getting
up
a
gang
to
rob
a
mail
sam
did
not
answer
he
put
the
contract
in
his
pocket
and
went
home
to
his
alcove
at
the
pergrins
he
wanted
to
get
by
himself
and
think
he
did
not
believe
that
he
would
by
any
chance
lose
frank
eckardt
s
money
but
he
knew
that
eckardt
himself
would
draw
back
from
the
kind
of
deals
that
he
expected
to
make
with
the
money
that
they
would
frighten
and
alarm
him
and
he
wondered
if
he
was
being
honest
in
his
own
room
after
dinner
sam
studied
carefully
the
agreement
drawn
by
webster
it
seemed
to
him
to
cover
what
he
wanted
covered
and
having
got
it
well
fixed
in
his
mind
he
tore
it
up
there
is
no
use
his
knowing
i
have
been
to
a
lawyer
he
thought
guiltily
getting
into
bed
he
began
building
plans
for
the
future
with
more
than
thirty
thousand
dollars
at
his
command
he
thought
that
he
should
be
able
to
make
headway
rapidly
in
my
hands
it
will
double
itself
every
year
he
told
himself
and
getting
out
of
bed
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
window
and
sat
down
feeling
strangely
alive
and
awake
like
a
young
man
in
love
he
saw
himself
going
on
and
on
directing
managing
ruling
men
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
not
do
i
will
run
factories
and
banks
and
maybe
mines
and
railroads
he
thought
and
his
mind
leaped
forward
so
that
he
saw
himself
grey
stern
and
capable
sitting
at
a
broad
desk
high
in
a
great
stone
building
a
materialisation
of
john
telfer
s
word
picture
you
will
be
a
big
man
of
dollars
it
is
and
then
into
sam
s
mind
came
another
picture
he
remembered
a
saturday
afternoon
when
a
young
man
had
come
running
into
the
office
on
south
water
street
a
young
man
who
owed
a
sum
of
money
and
could
not
pay
it
he
remembered
the
unpleasant
tightening
of
the
mouth
and
the
sudden
shrewd
hard
look
in
his
employer
s
long
narrow
face
he
had
not
heard
much
of
the
talk
but
he
was
aware
of
a
strained
pleading
quality
in
the
voice
of
the
young
man
who
had
said
over
and
over
slowly
and
painfully
but
man
my
honour
is
at
stake
and
of
a
coldness
in
the
answering
voice
replying
persistently
with
me
it
is
not
a
matter
of
honour
but
of
dollars
and
i
am
going
to
get
from
the
alcove
window
sam
looked
out
upon
a
vacant
lot
covered
with
patches
of
melting
snow
beyond
the
lot
facing
him
stood
a
flat
building
and
the
snow
melting
on
the
roof
made
a
little
stream
that
ran
down
some
hidden
pipe
and
rattled
out
upon
the
ground
the
noise
of
the
falling
water
and
the
sound
of
distant
footsteps
going
homeward
through
the
sleeping
city
brought
back
thoughts
of
other
nights
when
as
a
boy
in
caxton
he
had
sat
thus
thinking
disconnected
thoughts
without
knowing
it
sam
was
fighting
one
of
the
real
battles
of
his
life
a
battle
in
which
the
odds
were
very
much
against
the
quality
in
him
that
got
him
out
of
bed
to
look
at
the
vacant
lot
there
was
in
the
youth
much
of
the
brute
trader
blindly
intent
upon
gain
much
of
the
quality
that
has
given
america
so
many
of
its
great
men
it
was
the
quality
that
had
sent
him
in
secret
to
lawyer
webster
to
protect
himself
without
protecting
the
simple
credulous
young
medical
student
and
that
had
made
him
say
as
he
came
home
with
the
contract
in
his
pocket
i
will
do
what
i
can
when
in
truth
he
meant
i
will
get
what
i
there
may
be
business
men
in
america
who
do
not
get
what
they
can
who
simply
love
power
one
sees
men
here
and
there
in
banks
at
the
heads
of
great
industrial
trusts
in
factories
and
in
great
mercantile
houses
of
whom
one
would
like
to
think
thus
they
are
the
men
who
one
dreams
have
had
an
awakening
who
have
found
themselves
they
are
the
men
hopeful
thinkers
try
to
recall
again
and
again
to
the
mind
to
these
men
america
is
looking
it
is
asking
them
to
keep
the
faith
to
stand
themselves
up
against
the
force
of
the
brute
trader
the
dollar
man
the
man
who
with
his
one
cunning
wolf
quality
of
acquisitiveness
has
too
long
ruled
the
business
of
the
nation
i
have
said
that
the
sense
of
equity
in
sam
fought
an
unequal
battle
he
was
in
business
and
young
in
business
in
a
day
when
all
america
was
seized
with
a
blind
grappling
for
gain
the
nation
was
drunk
with
it
trusts
were
being
formed
mines
opened
from
the
ground
spurted
oil
and
gas
railroads
creeping
westward
opened
yearly
vast
empires
of
new
land
to
be
poor
was
to
be
a
fool
thought
waited
art
waited
and
men
at
their
firesides
gathered
their
children
around
them
and
talked
glowingly
of
men
of
dollars
holding
them
up
as
prophets
fit
to
lead
the
youth
of
the
young
nation
sam
had
in
him
the
making
of
the
new
the
commanding
man
of
business
it
was
that
quality
in
him
that
made
him
sit
by
the
window
thinking
before
going
to
the
medical
student
with
the
unfair
contract
and
the
same
quality
had
sent
him
forth
night
after
night
to
walk
alone
in
the
streets
when
other
young
men
went
to
theatres
or
to
walk
with
girls
in
the
park
he
had
in
truth
a
taste
for
the
lonely
hours
when
thought
grows
he
was
a
step
beyond
the
youth
who
hurries
to
the
theatre
or
buries
himself
in
stories
of
love
or
adventure
he
had
in
him
something
that
wanted
a
chance
in
the
flat
building
across
the
vacant
lot
a
light
appeared
at
a
window
and
through
the
lighted
window
he
saw
a
man
clad
in
pajamas
who
propped
a
sheet
of
music
against
a
and
who
had
a
shining
silver
horn
in
his
hand
sam
watched
filled
with
mild
curiosity
the
man
not
reckoning
on
an
onlooker
at
so
late
an
hour
began
an
elaborate
and
amusing
schedule
of
personation
he
opened
the
window
put
the
horn
to
his
lips
and
then
turning
bowed
before
the
lighted
room
as
before
an
audience
he
put
his
hand
to
his
lips
and
blew
kisses
about
then
put
the
horn
to
his
lips
and
looked
again
at
the
sheet
of
music
the
note
that
came
out
of
the
window
on
the
still
air
was
a
failure
it
flattened
into
a
squawk
sam
laughed
and
pulled
down
the
window
the
incident
had
brought
back
to
his
mind
another
man
who
bowed
to
a
crowd
and
blew
upon
a
horn
getting
into
bed
he
pulled
the
covers
about
him
and
went
to
sleep
i
will
get
frank
s
money
if
i
can
he
told
himself
settling
the
matter
that
had
been
in
his
mind
most
men
are
fools
and
if
i
do
not
get
his
money
some
other
man
on
the
next
afternoon
eckardt
had
lunch
down
town
with
sam
together
they
went
to
a
bank
where
sam
showed
the
profits
of
deals
he
had
made
and
the
growth
of
his
bank
account
going
afterward
into
south
water
street
where
sam
talked
glowingly
of
the
money
to
be
made
by
a
shrewd
man
who
knew
the
ways
of
the
street
and
had
a
head
upon
his
shoulders
that
s
just
it
said
frank
eckardt
falling
quickly
into
the
trap
sam
had
set
and
hungering
for
profits
i
have
money
but
no
head
on
my
shoulders
for
using
it
i
wish
you
would
take
it
and
see
what
you
can
with
a
thumping
heart
sam
went
home
across
the
city
to
the
pergrin
house
eckardt
beside
him
in
the
elevated
train
in
sam
s
room
the
agreement
was
written
out
by
sam
and
signed
by
eckardt
at
dinner
time
they
had
the
drygoods
buyer
in
to
sign
as
witness
and
the
agreement
turned
out
to
eckardt
s
advantage
in
no
year
did
sam
return
him
less
than
ten
per
cent
and
in
the
end
gave
back
the
principal
more
than
doubled
so
that
eckardt
was
able
to
retire
from
the
practice
of
medicine
and
live
upon
the
interest
of
his
capital
in
a
village
near
tiffin
ohio
with
the
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
his
hands
sam
began
to
reach
out
and
extend
the
scope
of
his
ventures
he
bought
and
sold
constantly
not
only
eggs
butter
apples
and
grain
but
also
houses
and
building
lots
through
his
head
marched
long
rows
of
figures
deals
worked
themselves
out
in
detail
in
his
brain
as
he
went
about
town
drinking
with
young
men
or
sat
at
dinner
in
the
pergrin
house
he
even
began
working
over
in
his
head
various
schemes
for
getting
into
the
firm
by
which
he
was
employed
and
thought
that
he
might
work
upon
getting
hold
of
his
interest
and
forcing
himself
into
control
and
then
the
fear
of
holding
him
back
and
his
growing
success
in
deals
keeping
his
mind
occupied
he
was
suddenly
confronted
by
an
opportunity
that
changed
entirely
the
plans
he
was
making
for
himself
through
jack
prince
s
suggestion
colonel
tom
rainey
of
the
great
rainey
arms
company
sent
for
him
and
offered
him
a
position
as
buyer
of
all
the
materials
used
in
their
factories
it
was
the
kind
of
connection
sam
had
unconsciously
been
seeking
a
company
strong
old
conservative
known
throughout
the
world
there
was
in
the
talk
with
colonel
tom
a
hint
of
future
opportunities
to
get
stock
in
the
company
and
perhaps
to
become
eventually
an
official
these
things
were
of
course
remote
to
be
dreamed
of
and
worked
toward
the
company
made
it
a
part
of
its
policy
sam
said
nothing
but
already
he
had
decided
to
accept
the
place
and
was
thinking
of
a
profitable
arrangement
touching
percentages
on
the
amount
saved
in
buying
that
had
worked
out
so
well
for
him
during
his
years
with
freedom
smith
sam
s
work
for
the
firearms
company
took
him
off
the
road
and
confined
him
to
an
office
all
day
long
in
a
way
he
regretted
this
the
complaints
he
had
heard
among
travelling
men
in
country
hotels
with
regard
to
the
hardship
of
travel
meant
nothing
to
his
mind
any
kind
of
travel
was
a
keen
pleasure
to
him
against
the
hardships
and
discomforts
he
balanced
the
tremendous
advantages
of
seeing
new
places
and
faces
and
getting
a
look
into
many
lives
and
he
looked
back
with
a
kind
of
retrospective
joy
on
the
three
years
of
hurrying
from
place
to
place
catching
trains
and
talking
with
chance
acquaintances
met
by
the
way
also
the
years
on
the
road
had
given
him
many
opportunities
for
secret
and
profitable
deals
of
his
own
over
against
these
advantages
the
place
at
rainey
s
threw
him
into
close
and
continuous
association
with
men
of
big
affairs
the
offices
of
the
arms
company
occupied
an
entire
floor
of
one
of
chicago
s
newest
and
biggest
skyscrapers
and
millionaire
stockholders
and
men
high
in
the
service
of
the
state
and
of
the
government
at
washington
came
in
and
went
out
at
the
door
sam
looked
at
them
closely
he
wanted
to
have
a
tilt
with
them
and
try
if
his
caxton
and
south
water
street
shrewdness
would
keep
the
head
upon
his
shoulders
in
lasalle
street
the
opportunity
seemed
to
him
a
big
one
and
he
went
about
his
work
quietly
and
ably
intent
upon
making
the
most
of
it
the
rainey
arms
company
at
the
time
of
sam
s
coming
with
it
was
still
largely
owned
by
the
rainey
family
father
and
daughter
colonel
rainey
a
military
looking
man
with
a
paunch
was
the
president
and
largest
individual
stockholder
he
was
a
pompous
swaggering
old
fellow
with
a
habit
of
making
the
most
trivial
statement
with
the
air
of
a
judge
pronouncing
the
death
sentence
and
sat
dutifully
at
his
desk
day
after
day
looking
very
important
and
thoughtful
smoking
long
black
cigars
and
signing
personally
piles
of
letters
brought
him
by
the
heads
of
various
departments
he
looked
upon
himself
as
a
silent
but
very
important
spoke
in
the
government
at
washington
and
every
day
issued
many
orders
which
the
men
at
the
heads
of
departments
received
with
respect
and
disregarded
in
secret
twice
he
had
been
prominently
mentioned
in
connection
with
cabinet
positions
in
the
national
government
and
in
talks
with
his
cronies
at
clubs
and
restaurants
he
gave
the
impression
of
having
actually
refused
an
offer
of
appointment
on
both
occasions
having
got
himself
established
as
a
factor
in
the
management
of
the
business
sam
found
many
things
that
surprised
him
in
every
company
of
which
he
knew
there
was
some
one
man
to
whom
all
looked
for
guidance
who
at
critical
moments
became
dominant
saying
do
this
or
that
and
making
no
explanations
in
the
rainey
company
he
found
no
such
man
but
instead
a
dozen
strong
departments
each
with
its
own
head
and
each
more
or
less
independent
of
the
others
sam
lay
in
his
bed
at
night
and
went
about
in
the
evening
thinking
of
this
and
of
its
meaning
among
the
department
heads
there
was
a
great
deal
of
loyalty
and
devotion
to
colonel
tom
and
he
thought
that
among
them
were
a
few
men
who
were
devoted
to
other
interests
than
their
own
at
the
same
time
he
told
himself
there
was
something
wrong
he
himself
had
no
such
feeling
of
loyalty
and
although
he
was
willing
to
give
lip
service
to
the
resounding
talk
of
the
colonel
about
the
fine
old
traditions
of
the
company
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
a
belief
in
the
idea
of
conducting
a
vast
business
on
a
system
founded
upon
lip
service
to
traditions
or
upon
loyalty
to
an
individual
there
must
be
loose
ends
lying
about
everywhere
he
thought
and
followed
the
thought
with
another
a
man
will
come
along
pick
up
these
loose
ends
and
run
the
whole
shop
why
not
i
the
rainey
arms
company
had
made
its
millions
for
the
rainey
and
whittaker
families
during
the
civil
war
whittaker
had
been
an
inventor
making
one
of
the
first
practical
guns
and
the
original
rainey
had
been
a
merchant
in
an
illinois
town
who
backed
the
inventor
it
proved
itself
a
rare
combination
whittaker
developed
into
a
wonderful
shop
manager
for
his
day
and
from
the
first
stayed
at
home
building
rifles
and
making
improvements
enlarging
the
plant
getting
out
the
goods
the
drygoods
merchant
scurried
about
the
country
going
to
washington
and
to
the
capitals
of
the
individual
states
pulling
wires
appealing
to
patriotism
and
state
pride
taking
big
orders
at
fat
prices
in
chicago
there
is
a
tradition
that
more
than
once
he
went
south
of
the
dixie
line
and
that
following
these
trips
thousands
of
rifles
found
their
way
into
the
hands
of
confederate
soldiers
but
this
story
which
increased
sam
s
respect
for
the
energetic
little
drygoods
merchant
colonel
tom
his
son
indignantly
denied
in
reality
colonel
tom
would
have
liked
to
think
of
the
first
rainey
as
a
huge
god
of
arms
like
windy
mcpherson
of
caxton
given
a
chance
he
would
have
invented
a
new
ancestor
after
the
civil
war
and
colonel
tom
s
growing
to
manhood
the
rainey
and
whittaker
fortunes
were
merged
into
one
through
the
marriage
of
jane
whittaker
the
last
of
her
line
to
the
only
surviving
rainey
and
upon
her
death
her
fortune
grown
to
more
than
a
million
stood
in
the
name
of
sue
rainey
the
only
issue
of
the
marriage
from
the
first
day
sam
began
to
forge
ahead
in
the
rainey
company
in
the
buying
end
he
found
a
rich
field
for
spectacular
money
saving
and
money
making
and
made
the
most
of
it
the
position
as
buyer
had
for
ten
years
been
occupied
by
a
distant
cousin
to
colonel
tom
now
dead
whether
the
cousin
was
a
fool
or
a
knave
sam
could
never
quite
decide
and
did
not
greatly
care
but
after
he
had
got
the
situation
in
hand
he
felt
that
the
man
must
have
cost
the
company
a
tremendous
sum
which
intended
to
save
sam
s
arrangement
with
the
company
gave
him
besides
a
fair
salary
half
he
saved
in
the
fixed
prices
of
standard
materials
these
prices
had
stood
fixed
for
years
and
sam
went
into
them
cutting
right
and
left
and
making
for
himself
during
his
first
year
thousand
dollars
at
the
end
of
the
year
when
the
directors
asked
to
have
an
adjustment
made
and
the
percentage
contract
annulled
he
got
a
generous
slice
of
company
stock
the
respect
of
colonel
tom
rainey
and
the
directors
the
fear
of
some
of
the
department
heads
the
loyal
devotion
of
others
and
the
title
of
treasurer
of
the
company
the
rainey
arms
company
was
in
truth
living
largely
upon
the
reputation
built
up
for
it
by
the
first
pushing
energetic
rainey
and
the
inventive
genius
of
his
partner
whittaker
under
colonel
tom
it
had
found
new
conditions
and
new
competition
which
he
had
ignored
or
met
in
a
way
standing
on
its
reputation
its
financial
strength
and
on
the
glory
of
its
past
achievements
dry
rot
ate
at
its
heart
the
damage
done
was
not
great
but
was
growing
greater
the
heads
of
the
departments
in
whose
hands
so
much
of
the
running
of
the
business
lay
were
many
of
them
incompetent
men
with
nothing
to
commend
them
but
long
years
of
service
and
in
the
treasurer
s
office
sat
a
quiet
young
man
barely
turned
twenty
who
had
no
friends
wanted
his
own
way
and
who
shook
his
head
over
the
office
traditions
and
was
proud
of
his
unbelief
seeing
the
absolute
necessity
of
working
through
colonel
tom
and
having
a
head
filled
with
ideas
of
things
he
wanted
done
sam
began
working
to
get
suggestions
into
the
older
man
s
mind
within
a
month
after
his
elevation
the
two
men
were
lunching
together
daily
and
sam
was
spending
many
extra
hours
behind
closed
doors
in
colonel
tom
s
office
although
american
business
and
manufacturing
had
not
yet
achieved
the
modern
idea
of
efficiency
in
shop
and
office
management
sam
had
many
of
these
ideas
in
his
mind
and
expounded
them
tirelessly
to
colonel
tom
he
hated
waste
he
cared
nothing
for
company
tradition
he
had
no
idea
as
did
the
heads
of
other
departments
of
getting
into
a
comfortable
berth
and
spending
the
rest
of
his
days
there
and
he
was
bent
on
managing
the
great
rainey
company
if
not
directly
then
through
colonel
tom
who
he
felt
was
putty
in
his
hands
from
his
new
position
as
treasurer
sam
did
not
drop
his
work
as
buyer
but
after
a
talk
with
colonel
tom
merged
the
two
departments
put
in
capable
assistants
of
his
own
and
went
on
with
his
work
of
effacing
the
tracks
of
the
cousin
for
years
the
company
had
been
overpaying
for
inferior
material
sam
put
his
own
material
inspectors
into
the
west
side
factories
and
brought
several
big
pennsylvania
steel
companies
scurrying
to
chicago
to
make
restitution
the
restitution
was
stiff
but
when
colonel
tom
was
appealed
to
sam
went
to
lunch
with
him
bought
a
bottle
of
wine
and
stiffened
his
back
one
afternoon
in
a
room
in
the
palmer
house
a
scene
was
played
out
that
for
days
stayed
in
sam
s
mind
as
a
kind
of
realisation
of
the
part
he
wanted
to
play
in
the
business
world
the
president
of
a
lumber
company
took
sam
into
the
room
and
laying
five
one
thousand
dollar
bills
upon
a
table
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
for
a
moment
sam
stood
looking
at
the
money
on
the
table
and
at
the
back
of
the
man
by
the
window
burning
with
indignation
he
felt
that
he
should
like
to
take
hold
of
the
man
s
throat
and
press
as
he
had
once
pressed
on
the
throat
of
windy
mcpherson
and
then
a
cold
gleam
coming
into
his
eyes
he
cleared
his
throat
and
said
you
are
short
here
you
will
have
to
build
this
pile
higher
if
you
expect
to
interest
the
man
by
the
window
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
a
slender
man
in
a
fancy
waistcoat
and
then
turning
and
taking
a
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
he
walked
to
the
table
facing
sam
i
shall
expect
you
to
be
reasonable
he
said
as
he
laid
the
bills
on
the
table
when
the
pile
had
reached
twenty
thousand
sam
reached
out
his
hand
and
taking
it
up
put
it
in
his
pocket
you
will
get
a
receipt
for
this
when
i
get
back
to
the
office
he
said
it
is
about
what
you
owe
our
company
for
overcharges
and
crooked
material
as
for
our
business
i
made
a
contract
with
another
company
this
having
got
the
buying
end
of
the
rainey
arms
company
straightened
out
to
his
liking
sam
began
spending
much
time
in
the
shops
and
through
colonel
tom
forced
big
changes
everywhere
he
discharged
useless
foremen
knocked
out
partitions
between
rooms
pushed
everywhere
for
more
and
better
work
like
the
modern
efficiency
man
he
went
about
with
a
watch
in
his
hand
cutting
out
lost
motion
rearranging
getting
his
own
way
it
was
a
time
of
great
agitation
the
offices
and
shops
buzzed
like
bees
disturbed
and
black
looks
followed
him
about
but
colonel
tom
rose
to
the
situation
and
went
about
at
sam
s
heels
swaggering
giving
orders
throwing
back
his
shoulders
like
a
man
remade
all
day
long
he
was
at
it
discharging
directing
roaring
against
waste
when
a
strike
broke
out
in
one
of
the
shops
because
of
innovations
sam
had
forced
upon
the
workmen
there
he
got
upon
a
bench
and
delivered
a
speech
written
by
sam
on
a
man
s
place
in
the
organisation
and
conducting
of
a
great
modern
industry
and
his
duty
to
perfect
himself
as
a
workman
silently
the
men
picked
up
their
tools
and
started
again
for
their
benches
and
when
he
saw
them
thus
affected
by
his
words
colonel
tom
brought
what
threatened
to
be
a
squally
affair
to
a
hurrahing
climax
by
the
announcement
of
a
five
per
cent
increase
in
the
wage
scale
that
was
colonel
tom
s
own
touch
and
the
rousing
reception
of
it
brought
a
glow
of
pride
to
his
cheeks
although
the
affairs
of
the
company
were
still
being
handled
by
colonel
tom
and
though
he
daily
more
and
more
asserted
himself
the
officers
and
shops
and
later
the
big
jobbers
and
buyers
as
well
as
the
rich
lasalle
street
directors
knew
that
a
new
force
had
come
into
the
company
men
began
dropping
quietly
into
sam
s
office
asking
questions
suggesting
seeking
favours
he
felt
that
he
was
getting
hold
of
the
department
heads
about
half
fought
him
and
were
secretly
marked
for
slaughter
the
others
came
to
him
expressed
approval
of
what
was
going
on
and
asked
him
to
look
over
their
departments
and
to
make
suggestions
for
improvements
through
them
this
sam
did
eagerly
getting
by
it
their
loyalty
and
support
which
later
stood
him
in
good
stead
in
choosing
the
new
men
that
came
into
the
company
sam
also
took
a
hand
the
method
used
was
characteristic
of
his
relations
with
colonel
tom
if
a
man
applying
for
a
place
suited
him
he
got
admission
to
the
colonel
s
office
and
listened
for
half
an
hour
to
a
talk
anent
the
fine
old
traditions
of
the
company
if
a
man
did
not
suit
sam
he
did
not
get
to
the
colonel
you
can
t
have
your
time
taken
up
by
them
sam
explained
in
the
rainey
company
the
various
heads
of
departments
were
stockholders
in
the
company
and
selected
from
among
themselves
two
men
to
sit
upon
the
board
and
in
his
second
year
sam
was
chosen
as
one
of
these
employee
directors
during
the
same
year
five
heads
of
departments
resigning
in
a
moment
of
indignation
over
one
of
sam
s
innovations
to
be
replaced
later
by
two
their
stock
by
a
prearranged
agreement
came
back
into
the
company
s
hands
this
stock
and
another
block
secured
for
him
by
the
colonel
got
into
sam
s
hands
through
the
use
of
eckardt
s
money
that
of
the
wabash
avenue
woman
and
his
own
snug
pile
sam
was
a
growing
force
in
the
company
he
sat
on
the
board
of
directors
the
recognised
practical
head
of
the
business
among
its
stockholders
and
employees
he
had
stopped
the
company
s
march
toward
a
second
place
in
its
industry
and
had
faced
it
about
all
about
him
in
offices
and
shops
there
was
the
swing
and
go
of
new
life
and
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
position
to
move
on
toward
real
control
and
had
begun
laying
lines
with
that
end
in
view
standing
in
the
offices
in
lasalle
street
or
amid
the
clang
and
roar
of
the
shops
he
tilted
up
his
chin
with
the
same
odd
little
gesture
that
had
attracted
the
men
of
caxton
to
him
when
he
was
a
barefoot
newsboy
and
the
son
of
the
town
drunkard
through
his
head
went
big
ambitious
projects
i
have
in
my
hand
a
great
tool
he
thought
with
it
i
will
pry
my
way
into
the
place
i
mean
to
occupy
among
the
big
men
of
this
city
and
this
chapter
iii
sam
mcpherson
who
stood
in
the
shops
among
the
thousands
of
employees
of
the
rainey
arms
company
who
looked
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
faces
of
the
men
intent
upon
the
operation
of
machines
and
saw
in
them
but
so
many
aids
to
the
ambitious
projects
stirring
in
his
brain
who
while
yet
a
boy
had
because
of
the
quality
of
daring
in
him
combined
with
a
gift
of
acquisitiveness
become
a
master
who
was
untrained
uneducated
knowing
nothing
of
the
history
of
industry
or
of
social
effort
walked
out
of
the
offices
of
his
company
and
along
through
the
crowded
streets
to
the
new
apartment
he
had
taken
on
michigan
avenue
it
was
saturday
evening
at
the
end
of
a
busy
week
and
as
he
walked
he
thought
of
things
he
had
accomplished
during
the
week
and
made
plans
for
the
one
to
come
through
madison
street
he
went
and
into
state
seeing
the
crowds
of
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
clambering
aboard
the
cable
cars
massed
upon
the
pavements
forming
in
groups
the
groups
breaking
and
reforming
and
the
whole
making
a
picture
intense
confusing
as
in
the
shops
among
the
men
workers
so
here
also
walked
the
youth
with
unseeing
eyes
he
liked
it
all
the
mass
of
people
the
clerks
in
their
cheap
clothing
the
old
men
with
young
girls
on
their
arms
going
to
dine
in
restaurants
the
young
man
with
a
wistful
look
in
his
eyes
waiting
for
his
sweetheart
in
the
shadow
of
the
towering
office
building
the
eager
straining
rush
of
the
whole
seemed
no
more
to
him
than
a
kind
of
gigantic
setting
for
action
action
controlled
by
a
few
quiet
capable
men
of
whom
he
intended
to
be
one
intent
upon
growth
in
state
street
he
stopped
at
a
shop
and
buying
a
bunch
of
roses
came
out
again
upon
the
crowded
street
in
the
crowd
before
him
walked
a
woman
tall
freewalking
with
a
great
mass
of
hair
on
her
head
as
she
passed
through
the
crowd
men
stopped
and
looked
back
at
her
their
eyes
ablaze
with
admiration
seeing
her
sam
sprang
forward
with
a
cry
edith
he
called
and
running
forward
thrust
the
roses
into
her
hand
for
janet
he
said
and
lifting
his
hat
walked
beside
her
along
state
to
van
buren
street
leaving
the
woman
at
a
corner
sam
came
into
a
region
of
cheap
theatres
and
dingy
hotels
women
spoke
to
him
young
men
in
flashy
overcoats
and
with
a
peculiar
assertive
animal
swing
to
their
shoulders
loitered
before
the
theatres
or
in
the
doorways
of
the
hotels
from
an
upstairs
restaurant
came
the
voice
of
another
young
man
singing
a
popular
song
of
the
street
there
ll
be
a
hot
time
in
the
old
town
sang
the
voice
over
a
cross
street
sam
went
into
michigan
avenue
faced
by
a
long
narrow
park
and
beyond
the
railroad
tracks
by
the
piles
of
new
earth
where
the
city
was
trying
to
regain
its
lake
front
in
the
cross
street
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
elevated
railroad
he
had
passed
a
whining
intoxicated
old
woman
who
lurched
forward
and
put
a
hand
upon
his
coat
sam
had
flung
her
a
quarter
and
passed
on
shrugging
his
shoulders
here
also
he
had
walked
with
unseeing
eyes
this
too
was
a
part
of
the
gigantic
machine
with
which
the
quiet
competent
men
of
growth
worked
from
his
new
quarters
in
the
top
floor
of
the
hotel
facing
the
lake
sam
walked
north
along
michigan
avenue
to
a
restaurant
where
negro
men
went
noiselessly
about
among
tables
serving
men
and
women
who
talked
and
laughed
under
the
shaded
lamps
had
an
assured
confident
air
passing
in
at
the
door
of
the
restaurant
a
wind
blowing
over
the
city
toward
the
lake
brought
the
sound
of
a
voice
floating
with
it
there
ll
be
a
hot
time
in
the
old
town
again
insisted
the
voice
after
dining
sam
got
on
a
grip
car
of
the
wabash
avenue
cable
sitting
on
the
front
seat
and
letting
the
panorama
of
the
town
roll
up
to
him
from
the
region
of
cheap
theatres
he
passed
through
streets
in
which
saloons
stood
massed
one
beside
another
each
with
its
wide
garish
doorway
and
its
dimly
lighted
ladies
entrance
and
into
a
region
of
neat
little
stores
where
women
with
baskets
upon
their
arms
stood
by
the
counters
and
sam
was
reminded
of
saturday
nights
in
caxton
the
two
women
edith
and
janet
eberly
met
through
jack
prince
to
one
of
whom
sam
had
sent
the
roses
at
the
hands
of
the
other
and
from
whom
he
had
borrowed
the
six
thousand
dollars
when
he
was
new
in
the
city
had
been
in
chicago
for
five
years
when
sam
came
to
know
them
for
all
of
the
five
years
they
had
lived
in
a
frame
building
that
had
been
a
residence
in
wabash
avenue
near
street
and
that
was
now
both
a
residence
and
a
grocery
store
the
apartment
upstairs
reached
by
a
stairway
at
the
side
of
the
grocery
had
in
the
five
years
and
under
the
hand
of
janet
eberly
become
a
thing
of
beauty
perfect
in
the
simplicity
and
completeness
of
its
appointment
the
two
women
were
the
daughters
of
a
farmer
who
had
lived
in
one
of
the
middle
western
states
facing
the
mississippi
river
their
grandfather
had
been
a
noted
man
in
the
state
having
been
one
of
its
first
governors
and
later
serving
it
in
the
senate
in
washington
there
was
a
county
and
a
town
named
for
him
and
he
had
once
been
talked
of
as
a
possibility
but
had
died
at
washington
before
the
convention
at
which
his
name
was
to
have
been
put
forward
his
one
son
a
youth
of
great
promise
went
to
west
point
and
served
brilliantly
through
the
civil
war
afterward
commanding
several
western
army
posts
and
marrying
the
daughter
of
another
army
man
his
wife
an
army
belle
died
after
having
borne
him
the
two
daughters
after
the
death
of
his
wife
major
eberly
began
drinking
and
to
get
away
from
the
habit
and
from
the
army
atmosphere
where
he
had
lived
with
his
wife
whom
he
loved
intensely
took
the
two
little
girls
and
returned
to
his
home
state
to
settle
on
a
farm
about
the
county
where
the
two
girls
grew
to
womanhood
their
father
major
eberly
got
the
name
of
a
character
seeing
people
but
seldom
and
treating
rudely
the
friendly
advances
of
his
farmer
neighbours
he
would
sit
in
the
house
for
days
poring
over
books
of
which
he
had
a
great
many
and
hundreds
of
which
were
now
on
open
shelves
in
the
apartment
of
the
two
girls
these
days
of
study
during
which
he
would
brook
no
intrusion
were
followed
by
days
of
fierce
industry
during
which
he
led
team
after
team
to
the
field
ploughing
or
reaping
day
and
night
with
no
rest
except
to
eat
at
the
edge
of
the
eberly
farm
there
was
a
little
wooden
country
church
surrounded
by
a
hay
field
and
on
sunday
mornings
during
the
summer
the
man
was
always
to
be
found
in
the
field
running
some
noisy
clattering
agricultural
implement
up
and
down
under
the
windows
of
the
church
and
disturbing
the
worship
of
the
country
folk
in
the
winter
he
drew
a
pile
of
logs
there
and
went
on
sunday
mornings
to
split
firewood
under
the
church
windows
while
his
daughters
were
small
he
was
several
times
haled
into
court
and
fined
for
cruel
neglect
of
his
animals
once
he
locked
a
great
herd
of
fine
sheep
in
a
shed
and
went
into
the
house
and
stayed
for
days
intent
upon
his
books
so
that
many
of
them
suffered
cruelly
for
want
of
food
and
water
when
he
was
taken
into
court
and
fined
half
the
county
came
to
the
trial
and
gloated
over
his
humiliation
to
the
two
girls
the
father
was
neither
cruel
nor
kind
leaving
them
largely
to
themselves
but
giving
them
no
money
so
that
they
went
about
in
dresses
made
over
from
those
of
the
mother
that
lay
piled
in
trunks
in
the
attic
when
they
were
small
an
old
negro
woman
an
of
the
army
belle
lived
with
and
mothered
them
but
when
edith
was
a
girl
of
ten
this
woman
went
off
home
to
tennessee
so
that
the
girls
were
thrown
on
their
own
resources
and
ran
the
house
in
their
own
way
janet
eberly
was
at
the
beginning
of
her
friendship
with
sam
a
slight
woman
of
with
a
small
expressive
face
quick
nervous
fingers
black
piercing
eyes
black
hair
and
a
way
of
becoming
so
absorbed
in
the
exposition
of
a
book
or
the
rush
of
a
conversation
that
her
little
intense
face
became
transfigured
and
her
quick
fingers
clutched
the
arm
of
her
listener
while
her
eyes
looked
into
his
and
she
lost
all
consciousness
of
his
presence
or
of
the
opinions
he
may
have
expressed
she
was
a
cripple
having
fallen
from
the
loft
of
a
barn
in
her
youth
injuring
her
back
so
that
she
sat
all
day
in
a
specially
made
reclining
wheeled
chair
edith
was
a
stenographer
working
in
the
office
of
a
publisher
down
town
and
janet
trimmed
hats
for
a
milliner
a
few
doors
down
the
street
from
the
house
in
which
they
lived
in
his
will
the
father
left
the
money
from
the
sale
of
the
farm
to
janet
and
sam
used
it
insuring
his
life
for
ten
thousand
dollars
in
her
name
while
it
was
in
his
possession
and
handling
it
with
a
caution
entirely
absent
from
his
operations
with
the
money
of
the
medical
student
take
it
and
make
money
for
me
the
little
woman
had
said
impulsively
one
evening
shortly
after
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
and
after
jack
prince
had
been
talking
flamboyantly
of
sam
s
ability
in
affairs
what
is
the
good
of
having
a
talent
if
you
do
not
use
it
to
benefit
those
who
haven
t
it
janet
eberly
was
an
intellect
she
disregarded
all
the
usual
womanly
points
of
view
and
had
an
attitude
of
her
own
toward
life
and
people
in
a
way
she
had
understood
her
father
and
during
the
time
of
her
great
physical
suffering
they
had
built
up
a
kind
of
understanding
and
affection
for
each
other
after
his
death
she
wore
a
miniature
of
him
made
in
his
boyhood
on
a
chain
about
her
neck
when
sam
met
her
the
two
immediately
became
close
friends
sitting
for
hours
in
talk
and
coming
to
look
forward
with
great
pleasure
to
the
evenings
spent
together
in
the
eberly
household
sam
mcpherson
was
a
benefactor
a
in
his
hands
the
six
thousand
dollars
was
bringing
two
thousand
a
year
into
the
house
and
adding
immeasurably
to
the
air
of
comfort
and
good
living
that
prevailed
there
to
janet
who
managed
the
house
he
was
guide
counsellor
and
something
more
than
friend
of
the
two
women
it
was
the
strong
vigorous
edith
with
the
hair
and
the
air
of
physical
completeness
that
made
men
stop
to
look
at
her
on
the
street
who
first
became
sam
s
friend
edith
eberly
was
strong
of
body
given
to
quick
flashes
of
anger
stupid
intellectually
and
hungry
to
the
roots
of
her
for
wealth
and
a
place
in
the
world
she
had
heard
through
jack
prince
of
sam
s
money
making
and
of
his
ability
and
prospects
and
for
a
time
had
designs
upon
his
affections
several
times
when
they
were
alone
together
she
gave
his
hand
a
characteristically
impulsive
squeeze
and
once
upon
the
stairway
beside
the
grocery
store
offered
him
her
lips
to
kiss
later
there
sprang
up
between
her
and
jack
prince
a
passionate
love
affair
dropped
finally
by
prince
through
fear
of
her
violent
fits
of
anger
after
sam
had
met
janet
eberly
and
had
become
her
loyal
friend
and
henchman
all
show
of
affection
or
even
of
interest
between
him
and
edith
was
at
an
end
and
the
kiss
upon
the
stairs
was
forgotten
going
up
the
stairway
after
the
ride
in
the
cable
car
sam
stood
beside
janet
s
wheel
chair
in
the
room
at
the
front
of
the
apartment
facing
wabash
avenue
the
chair
was
by
the
window
and
faced
an
open
coal
fire
in
a
grate
she
had
had
built
into
the
wall
of
the
house
outside
through
an
open
arched
doorway
edith
moved
noiselessly
about
taking
dishes
from
a
little
table
he
knew
that
after
a
time
jack
prince
would
come
and
take
her
to
the
theatre
leaving
janet
and
him
to
finish
their
talk
sam
lighted
his
pipe
and
between
puffs
began
talking
making
a
statement
that
he
knew
would
arouse
her
and
janet
putting
her
hand
impulsively
on
his
shoulder
began
tearing
the
statement
to
bits
you
talk
she
broke
out
books
are
not
full
of
pretence
and
lies
you
business
men
are
you
and
jack
prince
what
do
you
know
of
books
they
are
the
most
wonderful
things
in
the
world
men
sit
writing
them
and
forget
to
lie
but
you
business
men
never
forget
you
and
books
you
haven
t
read
books
not
real
ones
didn
t
my
father
know
didn
t
he
save
himself
from
insanity
through
books
do
i
not
sitting
here
get
the
real
feel
of
the
movement
of
the
world
through
the
books
that
men
write
suppose
i
saw
those
men
they
would
swagger
and
strut
and
take
themselves
seriously
just
like
you
or
jack
or
the
grocer
down
stairs
you
think
you
know
what
s
going
on
in
the
world
you
think
you
are
doing
things
you
chicago
men
of
money
and
action
and
growth
you
are
blind
all
the
little
woman
a
light
half
scorn
half
amusement
in
her
eyes
leaned
forward
and
ran
her
fingers
through
sam
s
hair
laughing
down
into
the
astonished
face
he
turned
up
to
her
oh
i
m
not
afraid
in
spite
of
what
edith
and
jack
prince
say
of
you
she
went
on
impulsively
i
like
you
all
right
and
if
i
were
a
well
woman
i
should
make
love
to
you
and
marry
you
and
then
see
to
it
there
was
something
in
this
world
for
you
besides
money
and
tall
buildings
and
men
and
machines
that
make
sam
grinned
you
are
like
your
father
driving
the
mowing
machine
up
and
down
under
the
church
windows
on
sunday
mornings
he
declared
you
think
you
could
remake
the
world
by
shaking
your
fist
at
it
i
should
like
to
go
and
see
you
fined
in
a
court
room
for
starving
janet
closing
her
eyes
and
lying
back
in
her
chair
laughed
with
delight
and
declared
that
they
would
have
a
splendid
quarrelsome
evening
after
edith
had
gone
out
sam
sat
through
the
evening
with
janet
listening
to
her
exposition
of
life
and
what
she
thought
it
should
mean
to
a
strong
capable
fellow
like
himself
as
he
had
been
listening
ever
since
their
acquaintanceship
began
in
the
talk
and
in
the
many
talks
they
had
had
together
talks
that
rang
in
his
ears
for
years
the
little
woman
gave
him
a
glimpse
into
a
whole
purposeful
universe
of
thought
and
action
of
which
he
had
never
dreamed
introducing
him
to
a
new
world
of
men
methodical
germans
emotional
dreaming
russians
analytical
courageous
norwegians
spaniards
and
italians
with
their
sense
of
beauty
and
blundering
hopeful
englishmen
wanting
so
much
and
getting
so
little
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
evening
he
went
out
of
her
presence
feeling
strangely
small
and
insignificant
against
the
great
world
background
she
had
drawn
for
him
sam
did
not
understand
janet
s
point
of
view
it
was
all
too
new
and
foreign
to
everything
life
had
taught
him
and
in
his
mind
he
fought
her
ideas
doggedly
clinging
to
his
own
concrete
practical
thoughts
and
hopes
but
on
the
train
homeward
bound
and
in
his
own
room
later
he
turned
over
and
over
in
his
mind
the
things
she
had
said
and
tried
in
a
dim
way
to
grasp
the
bigness
of
the
conception
of
human
life
she
had
got
sitting
in
a
wheel
chair
and
looking
down
into
wabash
avenue
sam
loved
janet
eberly
no
word
of
that
had
ever
passed
between
them
and
he
had
seen
her
hand
flash
out
and
grasp
the
shoulder
of
jack
prince
when
she
was
laying
down
to
him
some
law
of
life
as
she
saw
it
as
it
had
so
often
shot
out
and
grasped
his
own
but
had
she
been
able
to
spring
out
of
the
wheel
chair
he
should
have
taken
her
hand
and
gone
with
her
to
the
clergyman
within
the
hour
and
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
she
would
have
gone
with
him
gladly
janet
died
suddenly
during
the
second
year
of
sam
s
work
for
the
gun
company
without
a
direct
declaration
of
affection
from
him
but
during
the
years
when
they
were
much
together
he
thought
of
her
as
in
a
sense
his
wife
and
when
she
died
he
was
desolate
overdrinking
night
after
night
and
wandering
aimlessly
through
the
deserted
streets
during
hours
when
he
should
have
been
asleep
she
was
the
first
woman
who
ever
got
hold
of
and
stirred
his
manhood
and
she
awoke
something
in
him
that
made
it
possible
for
him
later
to
see
life
with
a
broadness
and
scope
of
vision
that
was
no
part
of
the
pushing
energetic
young
man
of
dollars
and
of
industry
who
sat
beside
her
wheeled
chair
during
the
evenings
on
wabash
avenue
after
janet
s
death
sam
did
not
continue
his
friendship
with
edith
but
turned
over
to
her
the
ten
thousand
dollars
to
which
the
six
thousand
of
janet
s
money
had
grown
in
his
hands
and
did
not
see
her
again
chapter
iv
one
night
in
april
colonel
tom
rainey
of
the
great
rainey
arms
company
and
his
chief
lieutenant
young
sam
mcpherson
treasurer
and
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
company
slept
together
in
a
room
in
a
paul
hotel
it
was
a
double
room
with
two
beds
and
sam
lying
on
his
pillow
looked
across
the
bed
to
where
the
colonel
s
paunch
protruding
itself
between
him
and
the
light
from
a
long
narrow
window
made
a
round
hill
above
which
the
moon
just
peeped
during
the
evening
the
two
men
had
sat
for
several
hours
at
a
table
in
the
grill
down
stairs
while
sam
discussed
a
proposition
he
proposed
making
to
a
paul
jobber
the
next
day
the
account
of
the
jobber
a
large
one
had
been
threatened
by
lewis
the
jew
manager
of
the
edwards
arms
company
the
rainey
company
s
only
important
western
rival
and
sam
was
full
of
ideas
to
checkmate
the
shrewd
trade
move
the
jew
had
made
at
the
table
the
colonel
had
been
silent
and
taciturn
an
unusual
attitude
of
mind
for
him
and
sam
lay
in
bed
and
looked
at
the
moon
gradually
working
its
way
over
the
undulating
abdominal
hill
wondering
what
was
in
his
mind
the
hill
dropped
showing
the
full
face
of
the
moon
and
then
rose
again
obliterating
it
sam
were
you
ever
in
love
asked
the
colonel
with
a
sigh
sam
turned
and
buried
his
face
in
the
pillow
and
the
white
covering
of
his
bed
danced
up
and
down
the
old
fool
has
it
come
to
that
with
him
he
asked
himself
after
all
these
years
of
single
life
is
he
going
to
begin
running
after
women
now
he
did
not
answer
the
colonel
s
question
there
are
breakers
ahead
for
you
old
boy
he
thought
the
figure
of
quiet
determined
little
sue
rainey
the
colonel
s
daughter
as
he
had
seen
her
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
had
dined
at
the
rainey
home
or
she
had
come
into
the
lasalle
street
offices
coming
into
his
mind
with
a
quiver
of
enjoyment
of
the
mental
exercise
he
tried
to
imagine
the
colonel
as
a
swaggering
blade
among
women
the
colonel
oblivious
of
sam
s
mirth
and
of
his
silence
regarding
his
experience
in
the
field
of
love
began
talking
making
amends
for
the
silence
in
the
grill
he
told
sam
that
he
had
decided
to
take
to
himself
a
new
wife
and
confessed
that
the
view
of
the
matter
his
daughter
might
take
worried
him
children
are
so
unfair
he
complained
they
forget
about
a
man
s
feelings
and
can
t
realise
that
his
heart
is
still
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
sam
began
trying
to
picture
a
woman
s
lying
in
his
place
and
looking
at
the
moon
over
the
pulsating
hill
the
colonel
continued
talking
he
grew
franker
telling
the
name
of
his
beloved
and
the
circumstances
of
their
meeting
and
courtship
she
is
an
actress
a
working
girl
he
said
feelingly
i
met
her
at
a
dinner
given
by
will
sperry
one
evening
and
she
was
the
only
woman
there
who
did
not
drink
wine
after
the
dinner
we
went
for
a
drive
together
and
she
told
me
of
her
hard
life
of
her
fight
against
temptations
and
of
her
brother
an
artist
she
is
trying
to
get
started
in
the
world
we
have
been
together
a
dozen
times
and
have
written
letters
and
sam
we
have
discovered
an
affinity
for
each
sam
sat
up
in
bed
letters
he
muttered
the
old
dog
is
going
to
get
himself
he
dropped
again
upon
the
pillow
well
let
him
why
need
i
bother
myself
the
colonel
having
begun
talking
could
not
stop
although
we
have
seen
each
other
only
a
dozen
times
a
letter
has
passed
between
us
every
day
oh
if
you
could
see
the
letters
she
writes
they
are
a
worried
sigh
broke
from
the
colonel
i
want
sue
to
invite
her
to
the
house
but
i
am
afraid
he
complained
i
am
afraid
she
will
be
about
it
women
are
such
determined
creatures
she
and
my
luella
should
meet
and
know
each
other
but
if
i
go
home
and
tell
her
she
may
make
a
scene
and
hurt
luella
s
the
moon
had
risen
shedding
its
light
in
sam
s
eyes
and
he
turned
his
back
to
the
colonel
and
prepared
to
sleep
the
naive
credulity
of
the
older
man
had
touched
a
spring
of
mirth
in
him
and
from
time
to
time
the
covering
of
his
bed
continued
to
quiver
suggestively
i
would
not
hurt
her
feelings
for
anything
she
is
the
squarest
little
woman
alive
the
voice
of
the
colonel
announced
the
voice
broke
and
the
colonel
who
habitually
roared
forth
his
sentiments
began
to
dither
sam
wondered
if
his
feelings
had
been
touched
by
the
thoughts
of
his
daughter
or
of
the
lady
from
the
stage
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
half
sobbed
the
colonel
when
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
gives
her
whole
heart
into
the
keeping
of
a
man
like
it
was
a
week
later
before
sam
heard
more
of
the
affair
looking
up
from
his
desk
in
the
offices
in
lasalle
street
one
morning
he
found
sue
rainey
standing
before
him
she
was
a
small
athletic
looking
woman
with
black
hair
square
shoulders
cheeks
browned
by
the
sun
and
wind
and
quiet
grey
eyes
she
stood
facing
sam
s
desk
and
pulled
off
a
glove
while
she
looked
down
at
him
with
amused
quizzical
eyes
sam
rose
and
leaning
over
the
desk
took
her
hand
wondering
what
had
brought
her
there
sue
rainey
did
not
mince
matters
but
plunged
at
once
into
an
explanation
of
the
purpose
of
her
visit
from
birth
she
had
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
wealth
although
she
was
not
counted
a
beautiful
woman
she
had
because
of
her
wealth
and
the
charm
of
her
person
been
much
courted
sam
who
had
talked
briefly
with
her
a
half
dozen
times
had
long
had
a
haunting
curiosity
to
know
more
of
her
personality
as
she
stood
there
before
him
looking
so
wonderfully
and
confident
he
thought
her
baffling
and
puzzling
the
colonel
she
began
and
then
hesitated
and
smiled
you
mcpherson
have
become
a
figure
in
my
father
s
life
he
depends
upon
you
very
much
he
tells
me
that
he
has
talked
with
you
concerning
a
miss
luella
london
from
the
theatre
and
that
you
have
agreed
with
him
that
the
colonel
and
she
should
sam
watched
her
gravely
a
flicker
of
mirth
ran
through
him
but
his
face
was
grave
and
disinterested
yes
he
said
looking
into
her
eyes
have
you
met
miss
london
i
have
answered
sue
rainey
have
you
sam
shook
his
head
she
is
impossible
declared
the
colonel
s
daughter
clutching
the
glove
held
in
her
hand
and
staring
at
the
floor
a
flush
of
anger
rose
in
her
cheeks
she
is
a
crude
hard
scheming
woman
she
colours
her
hair
she
cries
when
you
look
at
her
she
hasn
t
even
the
grace
to
be
ashamed
of
what
she
is
trying
to
do
and
she
has
got
the
colonel
into
a
sam
looked
at
the
brown
of
sue
rainey
s
cheek
and
thought
the
texture
of
it
beautiful
he
wondered
why
he
had
heard
her
called
a
plain
woman
the
heightened
colour
brought
to
her
face
by
her
anger
had
he
thought
transfigured
her
he
liked
her
direct
forceful
way
of
putting
the
matter
of
the
colonel
s
affair
and
felt
keenly
the
compliment
implied
by
her
having
come
to
him
she
has
he
told
himself
and
felt
a
thrill
of
pride
in
her
attitude
as
though
it
had
been
inspired
by
himself
i
have
been
hearing
of
you
a
great
deal
she
continued
glancing
up
at
him
and
smiling
at
our
house
you
are
brought
to
the
table
with
the
soup
and
taken
away
with
the
liqueur
my
father
interlards
his
table
talk
and
introduces
all
of
his
wise
new
axioms
on
economy
and
efficiency
and
growth
with
a
constant
procession
of
sam
says
and
sam
and
the
men
who
come
to
the
house
talk
of
you
also
teddy
foreman
says
that
at
directors
meetings
they
all
sit
about
like
children
waiting
for
you
to
tell
them
what
to
she
threw
out
her
hand
with
an
impatient
little
gesture
i
am
in
a
hole
she
said
i
might
handle
my
father
but
i
can
not
handle
that
while
she
had
been
talking
to
him
sam
looked
past
her
and
out
at
a
window
when
her
eyes
wandered
from
his
face
he
looked
again
at
her
brown
firm
cheeks
from
the
beginning
of
the
interview
he
had
been
intending
to
help
her
give
me
the
lady
s
address
he
said
i
ll
go
look
her
three
evenings
later
sam
took
miss
luella
london
to
a
midnight
supper
at
one
of
the
town
s
best
restaurants
she
knew
the
motive
of
his
taking
her
as
he
had
been
quite
frank
in
the
few
minutes
talk
near
the
stage
door
of
the
theatre
when
the
engagement
was
made
as
they
ate
they
talked
of
the
plays
at
the
chicago
theatres
and
sam
told
her
a
story
of
an
amateur
performance
that
had
once
taken
place
in
the
hall
over
geiger
s
drug
store
in
caxton
when
he
was
boy
in
the
performance
sam
had
taken
the
rôle
of
a
drummer
boy
killed
on
the
field
of
battle
by
a
swaggering
villain
in
a
grey
uniform
and
john
telfer
in
the
rôle
of
villain
had
become
so
in
earnest
that
a
pistol
not
exploding
at
a
critical
moment
he
had
chased
sam
about
the
stage
trying
to
hit
him
with
the
butt
of
the
weapon
while
the
audience
roared
with
delight
at
the
realism
of
telfer
s
rage
and
at
the
frightened
boy
begging
for
mercy
luella
london
laughed
heartily
at
sam
s
story
and
then
the
coffee
being
served
she
fingered
the
handle
of
the
cup
and
a
shrewd
look
came
into
her
eyes
and
now
you
are
a
big
business
man
and
have
come
to
see
me
about
colonel
rainey
she
said
sam
lighted
a
cigar
just
how
much
are
you
counting
on
this
marriage
between
yourself
and
the
colonel
he
asked
bluntly
the
actress
laughed
and
poured
cream
into
her
coffee
a
line
came
and
went
on
her
forehead
between
her
eyes
sam
thought
she
looked
capable
i
have
been
thinking
of
what
you
told
me
at
the
stage
door
she
said
and
a
childlike
smile
played
about
her
lips
do
you
know
mcpherson
i
can
t
just
figure
you
i
can
t
just
see
how
you
get
into
this
where
are
your
credentials
anyway
sam
keeping
his
eyes
upon
her
face
took
a
jump
into
the
dark
it
s
this
way
he
said
i
m
something
of
an
adventurer
myself
i
fly
the
black
flag
i
come
from
where
you
do
i
had
to
reach
out
my
hand
and
take
what
i
wanted
i
do
not
blame
you
in
the
least
but
it
just
happens
that
i
saw
colonel
tom
rainey
first
he
is
my
game
and
i
do
not
propose
to
have
you
fooling
around
i
am
not
bluffing
you
have
got
to
get
off
leaning
forward
he
stared
at
her
intently
and
then
lowered
his
voice
i
ve
got
your
record
i
know
the
man
you
used
to
live
with
he
s
going
to
help
me
get
you
if
you
do
not
drop
sitting
back
in
his
chair
sam
watched
her
gravely
he
had
taken
the
odd
chance
to
win
quickly
by
a
bluff
and
had
won
but
luella
london
was
not
to
be
defeated
without
a
struggle
you
lie
she
cried
half
springing
from
her
chair
frank
has
never
oh
yes
frank
has
answered
sam
turning
as
though
to
call
a
waiter
i
will
have
him
here
in
ten
minutes
if
you
wish
to
be
picking
up
a
fork
the
woman
began
nervously
picking
holes
in
the
table
cloth
and
a
tear
appeared
upon
her
cheek
she
took
a
handkerchief
from
a
bag
that
hung
hooked
over
the
back
of
a
chair
at
the
side
of
the
table
and
wiped
her
eyes
all
right
all
right
she
said
bracing
herself
i
ll
drop
it
if
you
ve
dug
up
frank
robson
you
ve
got
me
he
ll
do
anything
you
say
for
a
piece
of
for
some
minutes
the
two
sat
in
silence
a
tired
look
had
come
into
the
woman
s
eyes
i
wish
i
was
a
man
she
said
i
get
whipped
at
everything
i
tackle
because
i
m
a
woman
i
m
getting
past
my
days
in
the
theatre
and
i
thought
the
colonel
was
fair
he
is
answered
sam
dispassionately
but
you
see
i
beat
you
to
it
he
s
glancing
cautiously
about
the
room
he
took
a
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
and
began
laying
them
one
at
a
time
upon
the
table
look
here
he
said
you
ve
done
a
good
piece
of
work
you
should
have
won
for
ten
years
half
the
society
women
of
chicago
have
been
trying
to
marry
their
daughters
or
their
sons
to
the
rainey
fortune
they
had
everything
to
help
them
wealth
good
looks
and
a
standing
in
the
world
you
have
none
of
these
things
how
did
you
do
it
anyway
he
went
on
i
m
not
going
to
see
you
trimmed
i
ve
got
ten
thousand
dollars
here
as
good
rainey
money
as
ever
was
printed
you
sign
this
paper
and
then
put
the
roll
in
your
that
s
square
said
luella
london
signing
and
with
the
light
coming
back
into
her
eyes
sam
beckoned
to
the
proprietor
of
the
restaurant
whom
he
knew
and
had
him
and
a
waiter
sign
as
witnesses
luella
london
put
the
roll
of
bills
into
her
purse
what
did
you
give
me
that
money
for
when
you
had
me
beat
anyway
she
asked
sam
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
and
folding
the
paper
put
it
in
his
pocket
because
i
like
you
and
i
admire
your
skill
he
said
and
anyway
i
did
not
have
you
beaten
until
right
they
sat
studying
the
people
getting
up
from
the
tables
and
going
through
the
door
to
waiting
carriages
and
automobiles
the
women
with
assured
airs
serving
sam
s
mind
to
make
a
contrast
for
the
woman
who
sat
with
him
i
presume
you
are
right
about
women
he
said
musingly
it
must
be
a
stiff
game
for
you
if
you
like
winning
on
your
own
winning
we
don
t
the
lips
of
the
actress
drew
back
showing
her
white
teeth
no
woman
ever
won
who
tried
to
play
a
straight
fighting
game
for
her
voice
grew
tense
and
the
lines
upon
her
forehead
reappeared
woman
can
t
stand
alone
she
went
on
she
is
a
sentimental
fool
she
reaches
out
her
hand
to
some
man
and
that
in
the
end
beats
her
why
even
when
she
plays
the
game
as
i
played
it
against
the
colonel
some
rat
of
a
man
like
frank
robson
for
whom
she
has
given
up
everything
worth
while
to
a
woman
sells
her
sam
looked
at
her
hand
covered
with
rings
lying
on
the
table
let
s
not
misunderstand
each
other
he
said
quietly
do
not
blame
frank
for
this
i
never
knew
him
i
just
imagined
a
puzzled
look
came
into
the
woman
s
eyes
and
a
flush
rose
in
her
cheeks
you
grafter
she
sneered
sam
called
to
a
passing
waiter
and
ordered
a
fresh
bottle
of
wine
what
s
the
use
being
sore
he
asked
it
s
simple
enough
you
staked
against
a
better
mind
anyway
you
have
the
ten
thousand
haven
t
you
luella
reached
for
her
purse
i
don
t
know
she
said
i
ll
look
haven
t
you
decided
to
steal
it
back
yet
sam
laughed
i
m
coming
to
that
he
said
don
t
hurry
for
several
minutes
they
sat
eyeing
each
other
and
then
with
an
earnest
ring
in
his
voice
and
a
smile
on
his
lips
sam
began
talking
again
look
here
he
said
i
m
no
frank
robson
and
i
do
not
like
giving
a
woman
the
worst
of
it
i
have
been
studying
you
and
i
can
t
see
you
running
around
loose
with
ten
thousand
dollars
of
real
money
on
you
you
do
not
fit
into
the
picture
and
the
money
will
not
last
a
year
in
your
hands
give
it
to
me
he
urged
let
me
invest
it
for
you
i
m
a
winner
i
ll
double
it
for
you
in
a
the
actress
stared
past
sam
s
shoulder
to
where
a
group
of
young
men
sat
about
a
table
drinking
and
talking
loudly
sam
began
telling
an
anecdote
of
an
irish
baggage
man
in
caxton
when
he
had
finished
he
looked
at
her
and
laughed
as
that
shoemaker
looked
to
jerry
donlin
so
you
as
the
colonel
s
wife
looked
to
me
he
said
i
had
to
make
you
get
out
of
my
flower
a
gleam
of
resolution
came
into
the
wandering
eyes
of
luella
london
and
she
took
the
purse
from
the
back
of
the
chair
and
brought
out
the
roll
of
bills
i
m
a
sport
she
said
and
i
m
going
to
lay
a
bet
on
the
best
horse
i
ever
saw
you
may
trim
me
but
i
always
would
take
a
turning
she
called
a
waiter
and
handing
him
a
bill
from
her
purse
threw
the
roll
on
the
table
take
the
pay
for
the
spread
and
the
wine
we
have
had
out
of
that
she
said
handing
him
the
loose
bill
and
then
turning
to
sam
you
ought
to
beat
the
world
anyway
your
genius
gets
recognition
from
me
i
pay
for
this
party
and
when
you
see
the
colonel
say
to
him
for
the
next
day
at
his
request
sue
rainey
called
at
the
offices
of
the
arms
company
and
sam
handed
her
the
paper
signed
by
luella
london
it
was
an
agreement
on
her
part
to
divide
with
sam
half
and
half
any
money
she
might
be
able
to
blackmail
out
of
colonel
rainey
the
colonel
s
daughter
glanced
from
the
paper
to
sam
s
face
i
thought
so
she
said
and
a
puzzled
look
came
into
her
eyes
but
i
do
not
understand
this
what
does
this
paper
do
and
what
did
you
pay
for
it
the
paper
sam
answered
puts
her
in
a
hole
and
i
paid
ten
thousand
dollars
for
sue
rainey
laughed
and
taking
a
checkbook
from
her
handbag
laid
it
on
the
desk
and
sat
down
do
you
get
your
half
she
asked
i
get
it
all
answered
sam
and
then
leaning
back
in
his
chair
launched
into
an
explanation
when
he
had
told
her
of
the
talk
in
the
restaurant
she
sat
with
the
checkbook
lying
before
her
and
with
the
puzzled
look
still
in
her
eyes
without
giving
her
time
for
comment
sam
plunged
into
the
midst
of
what
had
been
in
his
mind
to
say
to
her
the
woman
will
not
bother
the
colonel
any
more
he
declared
if
that
paper
won
t
hold
her
something
else
will
she
respects
me
and
she
is
afraid
of
me
we
had
a
talk
after
she
had
signed
the
paper
and
she
gave
me
the
ten
thousand
dollars
to
invest
for
her
i
promised
to
double
it
for
her
within
a
year
and
i
want
to
make
good
i
want
you
to
double
it
now
make
the
check
for
twenty
sue
rainey
wrote
the
check
making
it
payable
to
bearer
and
pushed
it
across
the
table
i
can
not
say
that
i
understand
yet
she
confessed
did
you
also
fall
in
love
with
her
sam
grinned
he
was
wondering
whether
he
would
be
able
to
get
into
words
just
what
he
wanted
to
tell
her
of
the
actress
soldier
of
fortune
he
looked
across
the
table
at
her
frank
grey
eyes
and
then
on
an
impulse
decided
that
he
would
tell
it
straight
out
as
though
she
had
been
a
man
it
s
like
this
he
said
i
like
ability
and
good
brains
and
that
woman
has
them
she
isn
t
a
good
woman
but
nothing
in
her
life
has
made
her
want
to
be
good
all
her
life
she
has
been
going
the
wrong
way
and
now
she
wants
to
get
on
her
feet
and
squared
around
that
s
what
she
was
after
the
colonel
for
she
did
not
want
to
marry
him
she
wanted
to
make
him
give
her
the
start
she
was
after
i
got
the
best
of
her
because
somewhere
there
is
a
snivelling
little
whelp
of
a
man
who
has
taken
all
the
good
and
the
fineness
out
of
her
and
who
now
stands
ready
to
sell
her
out
for
a
few
dollars
i
imagined
there
would
be
such
a
man
when
i
saw
her
and
i
bluffed
my
way
through
to
him
but
i
do
not
want
to
whip
a
woman
even
in
such
an
affair
through
the
cheapness
of
some
man
i
want
to
do
the
square
thing
by
her
that
s
why
i
asked
you
to
make
that
check
for
twenty
sue
rainey
rose
and
stood
by
the
desk
looking
down
at
him
he
was
thinking
how
wonderfully
clear
and
honest
her
eyes
and
what
about
the
colonel
she
asked
what
will
he
think
of
all
this
sam
walked
around
the
desk
and
took
her
hand
we
ll
have
to
agree
not
to
consider
him
he
said
we
really
did
that
you
know
when
we
started
this
thing
i
think
we
can
depend
upon
miss
london
s
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
the
and
miss
london
did
she
sent
for
sam
a
week
later
and
put
hundred
dollars
into
his
hand
that
s
not
to
invest
for
me
she
said
that
s
for
yourself
by
the
agreement
i
signed
with
you
we
were
to
split
anything
i
got
out
of
the
colonel
well
i
went
light
i
only
got
five
thousand
with
the
money
in
his
hand
sam
stood
by
the
side
of
a
little
table
in
her
room
looking
at
her
what
did
you
tell
the
colonel
he
asked
i
called
him
up
here
to
my
room
last
night
and
lying
here
in
bed
i
told
him
that
i
had
just
discovered
i
was
the
victim
of
an
incurable
disease
i
told
him
that
within
a
month
i
would
be
in
bed
for
keeps
and
asked
him
to
marry
me
at
once
and
to
take
me
away
with
him
to
some
quiet
place
where
i
could
die
in
his
coming
over
to
sam
luella
london
put
a
hand
upon
his
arm
and
laughed
he
began
to
beg
off
and
make
excuses
she
went
on
and
then
i
brought
out
his
letters
to
me
and
talked
straight
he
wilted
at
once
and
paid
the
five
thousand
dollars
i
asked
for
the
letters
without
a
murmur
i
might
have
made
it
fifty
and
with
your
talent
you
ought
to
get
all
he
has
in
six
sam
shook
hands
with
her
and
told
her
of
his
success
in
doubling
the
money
she
had
put
into
his
hands
then
putting
the
hundred
dollars
in
his
pocket
he
went
back
to
his
desk
he
did
not
see
her
again
and
when
through
a
lucky
market
turn
he
had
increased
the
twenty
thousand
dollars
she
had
left
with
him
to
he
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
a
trust
company
for
her
and
forgot
the
incident
years
later
he
heard
that
she
was
running
a
fashionable
dressmaking
establishment
in
a
western
city
and
colonel
tom
rainey
who
had
for
months
talked
of
nothing
but
factory
efficiency
and
of
what
he
and
young
sam
mcpherson
were
going
to
do
in
the
way
of
enlarging
the
business
began
the
next
morning
a
tirade
against
women
that
lasted
the
rest
of
his
life
chapter
v
sue
rainey
had
long
touched
the
fancy
of
the
youths
of
chicago
society
who
while
looking
at
her
trim
little
figure
and
at
the
respectable
size
of
the
fortune
behind
it
were
yet
puzzled
and
disconcerted
by
her
attitude
toward
themselves
on
the
wide
porches
at
golf
clubs
where
young
men
in
white
trousers
lounged
and
smoked
cigarettes
and
in
the
clubs
where
the
same
young
men
spent
winter
afternoons
playing
kelly
pool
they
spoke
of
her
calling
her
an
enigma
she
ll
end
by
being
an
old
maid
they
declared
and
shook
their
heads
at
the
thought
of
so
good
a
connection
dangling
loosely
in
the
air
just
without
their
reach
from
time
to
time
one
of
the
young
men
tore
himself
loose
from
the
group
that
contemplated
her
and
with
an
opening
volley
of
books
candy
flowers
and
invitations
to
theatres
charged
down
upon
her
only
to
have
the
youthful
ardour
of
his
attack
cooled
by
her
prolonged
attitude
of
indifference
when
she
was
a
young
english
cavalry
officer
who
came
to
chicago
to
ride
in
the
horse
show
had
for
some
weeks
been
seen
much
in
her
company
and
a
report
of
their
engagement
had
been
whispered
through
the
town
and
talked
of
about
the
nineteenth
hole
at
the
country
clubs
the
rumour
proved
to
be
without
foundation
the
attraction
to
the
cavalry
officer
having
been
a
certain
brand
of
rare
old
wine
the
colonel
had
stored
in
his
cellar
and
a
feeling
of
brotherhood
with
the
swaggering
old
gun
maker
rather
than
the
colonel
s
quiet
little
daughter
after
the
beginning
of
his
acquaintanceship
with
her
and
all
during
the
days
when
he
stirred
things
up
in
the
offices
and
shops
of
the
gun
company
tales
of
the
assiduous
and
often
needy
young
men
who
were
camped
on
her
trail
reached
sam
s
ears
they
would
be
in
at
the
office
to
see
and
talk
with
the
colonel
who
had
several
times
confided
to
sam
that
his
daughter
sue
was
already
past
the
age
at
which
young
women
should
marry
and
in
the
absence
of
the
father
two
or
three
of
them
had
formed
a
habit
of
stopping
for
a
word
with
sam
whom
they
had
met
through
the
colonel
or
jack
prince
they
declared
that
they
were
squaring
themselves
with
the
not
a
difficult
thing
to
do
sam
thought
as
he
drank
the
wine
smoked
the
cigars
and
ate
the
dinners
of
all
without
prejudice
once
at
luncheon
colonel
tom
discussed
these
young
men
with
sam
pounding
on
a
table
so
that
the
glasses
jumped
about
and
calling
them
damned
upstarts
for
his
own
part
sam
did
not
feel
that
he
knew
sue
rainey
and
although
after
their
first
meeting
one
evening
at
the
rainey
house
he
had
been
pricked
by
a
mild
curiosity
concerning
her
no
opportunity
to
satisfy
it
had
presented
itself
he
knew
that
she
was
athletic
travelled
much
rode
shot
and
sailed
a
boat
and
he
had
heard
jack
prince
speak
of
her
as
a
woman
of
brains
but
until
the
incident
of
the
colonel
and
luella
london
threw
them
for
the
moment
into
the
same
enterprise
and
started
him
thinking
of
her
with
real
interest
he
had
seen
and
talked
with
her
for
but
brief
passing
moments
brought
about
by
their
mutual
interest
in
the
affairs
of
her
father
after
janet
eberly
s
sudden
death
and
while
he
was
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
grief
at
her
loss
sam
had
his
first
long
talk
with
sue
rainey
it
was
in
colonel
tom
s
office
and
sam
walking
hurriedly
in
found
her
sitting
at
the
colonel
s
desk
and
staring
out
of
the
window
at
a
broad
expanse
of
flat
roofs
a
man
climbing
a
flag
pole
to
replace
a
slipped
rope
caught
his
attention
and
standing
by
the
window
looking
at
the
minute
figure
clinging
to
the
swaying
pole
he
began
talking
of
the
absurdity
of
human
endeavour
the
colonel
s
daughter
listened
respectfully
to
his
rather
obvious
banalities
and
getting
up
from
her
chair
came
to
stand
beside
him
sam
turned
slyly
to
look
at
her
firm
brown
cheeks
as
he
had
looked
on
the
morning
when
she
had
come
to
see
him
about
luella
london
and
was
struck
by
the
thought
that
she
in
some
faint
way
reminded
him
of
janet
eberly
in
a
moment
and
rather
to
his
own
surprise
he
burst
into
a
long
speech
telling
of
janet
of
the
tragedy
of
her
loss
and
something
of
the
beauty
of
her
life
and
character
the
nearness
of
his
loss
and
the
nearness
also
of
what
he
thought
might
be
a
sympathetic
listener
spurred
him
and
he
found
himself
getting
a
kind
of
relief
for
the
aching
sense
of
loss
for
his
dead
comrade
by
heaping
praises
upon
her
life
when
he
had
finished
saying
what
was
in
his
mind
he
stood
by
the
window
feeling
awkward
and
embarrassed
the
man
who
climbed
the
flag
pole
having
put
the
rope
through
the
ring
at
the
top
slid
suddenly
down
the
pole
and
thinking
for
the
moment
that
he
had
fallen
sam
made
a
quick
clutch
at
the
air
with
his
hand
his
gripping
fingers
closed
over
sue
rainey
s
hand
he
turned
amused
by
the
incident
and
began
making
a
halting
explanation
there
were
tears
in
sue
rainey
s
eyes
i
wish
i
had
known
her
she
said
and
drew
her
hand
from
between
his
fingers
i
wish
you
had
known
me
better
that
i
also
might
have
known
your
janet
they
are
rare
such
women
they
are
worth
much
to
know
most
women
like
most
men
she
made
an
impatient
gesture
with
her
hand
and
sam
turning
walked
toward
the
door
he
felt
that
he
might
not
trust
himself
to
answer
her
for
the
first
time
since
coming
to
manhood
he
felt
that
tears
might
at
any
moment
come
into
his
eyes
grief
for
the
loss
of
janet
surged
through
him
disconcerting
and
engulfing
him
i
have
been
doing
you
an
injustice
said
sue
rainey
looking
at
the
floor
i
have
thought
of
you
as
something
different
from
what
you
are
there
is
a
story
i
heard
of
you
which
gave
me
a
wrong
sam
smiled
having
conquered
the
commotion
within
himself
he
laughed
and
explained
the
incident
of
the
man
who
had
slid
down
the
pole
what
was
the
story
you
heard
he
asked
it
was
a
story
a
young
man
told
at
our
house
she
explained
hesitatingly
refusing
to
be
carried
away
from
her
mood
of
seriousness
it
was
about
a
little
girl
you
saved
from
drowning
and
a
purse
made
up
and
given
you
why
did
you
take
the
money
sam
looked
at
her
squarely
the
story
was
one
that
jack
prince
had
delight
in
telling
it
concerned
an
incident
of
his
early
business
life
in
the
city
one
afternoon
when
he
was
still
in
the
employ
of
the
commission
firm
he
had
taken
a
party
of
men
for
a
trip
on
an
excursion
steamer
on
the
lake
he
had
a
project
into
which
he
wanted
them
to
go
with
him
and
had
taken
them
aboard
the
steamer
to
get
them
together
and
present
the
merits
of
his
scheme
during
the
trip
a
little
girl
had
fallen
overboard
and
sam
springing
after
her
had
brought
her
safely
aboard
the
boat
on
the
excursion
steamer
a
cheer
had
arisen
a
young
man
in
a
cowboy
hat
ran
about
taking
up
a
collection
people
crowded
forward
to
grasp
sam
s
hand
and
he
had
accepted
the
money
collected
and
had
put
it
in
his
pocket
among
the
men
aboard
the
boat
were
several
who
while
they
did
not
draw
back
from
going
into
sam
s
project
had
thought
his
taking
the
money
not
manly
they
had
told
the
story
and
it
had
come
to
the
ears
of
jack
prince
who
never
tired
of
repeating
it
and
always
ended
the
story
with
the
request
that
the
listener
ask
sam
why
he
had
taken
the
money
now
in
colonel
tom
s
office
facing
sue
rainey
sam
made
the
explanation
that
had
so
delighted
jack
prince
the
crowd
wanted
to
give
me
the
money
he
said
slightly
perplexed
why
shouldn
t
i
have
taken
it
i
did
not
save
the
little
girl
for
the
money
but
because
she
was
a
little
girl
and
the
money
paid
for
my
ruined
clothes
and
the
expenses
of
the
with
his
hand
on
the
doorknob
he
looked
steadily
at
the
woman
before
him
and
i
wanted
the
money
he
announced
a
ring
of
defiance
in
his
voice
i
have
always
wanted
money
any
money
i
could
sam
went
back
to
his
own
office
and
sat
down
at
his
desk
he
had
been
surprised
by
the
cordiality
and
friendliness
sue
rainey
had
shown
toward
him
on
an
impulse
he
wrote
a
letter
defending
his
position
in
the
matter
of
the
money
taken
on
the
excursion
steamer
and
setting
forth
something
of
the
attitude
of
his
mind
toward
money
and
business
affairs
i
can
not
see
myself
believing
in
the
rot
most
business
men
talk
he
wrote
at
the
end
of
the
letter
they
are
full
of
sentiment
and
ideals
which
are
not
true
having
a
thing
to
sell
they
always
say
it
is
the
best
although
it
may
be
third
rate
i
do
not
object
to
that
what
i
do
object
to
is
the
way
they
have
of
nursing
a
hope
within
themselves
that
the
third
rate
thing
is
first
rate
until
the
hope
becomes
a
belief
in
the
talk
i
had
with
that
actress
luella
london
i
told
her
that
i
myself
flew
the
black
flag
well
i
do
i
would
lie
about
goods
to
sell
them
but
i
would
not
lie
to
myself
i
will
not
stultify
my
own
mind
if
a
man
crosses
swords
with
me
in
a
business
deal
and
i
come
out
of
the
affair
with
the
money
it
is
no
sign
that
i
am
the
greater
rascal
rather
it
is
a
sign
that
i
am
the
keener
with
the
note
lying
before
him
on
the
desk
sam
wondered
why
he
had
written
it
it
seemed
to
him
an
accurate
and
straightforward
statement
of
the
business
creed
he
had
adopted
for
himself
but
a
rather
absurd
note
to
write
to
a
woman
and
then
not
allowing
himself
time
to
reconsider
his
action
he
addressed
an
envelope
and
going
out
into
the
general
offices
dropped
it
into
the
mail
chute
it
will
let
her
know
where
i
stand
anyway
he
thought
with
a
return
of
the
defiant
mood
in
which
he
had
told
her
the
motive
of
his
action
on
the
boat
within
the
next
ten
days
after
the
talk
in
colonel
tom
s
office
sam
saw
sue
rainey
several
times
coming
to
or
going
from
her
father
s
office
once
meeting
in
the
little
lobby
by
the
office
entrance
she
stopped
and
put
out
her
hand
which
sam
took
awkwardly
he
had
a
feeling
that
she
would
not
have
regretted
an
opportunity
to
continue
the
sudden
little
intimacy
that
had
sprung
up
between
them
in
the
few
minutes
talk
of
janet
eberly
the
feeling
did
not
come
from
vanity
but
from
a
belief
in
sam
that
she
was
in
some
way
lonely
and
wanting
companionship
although
she
had
been
much
courted
she
lacked
he
thought
the
talent
for
comradeship
or
quick
friendliness
like
janet
she
is
more
than
half
intellect
he
told
himself
and
felt
a
pang
of
regret
for
the
slight
disloyalty
of
the
further
thought
that
there
was
in
sue
a
something
more
substantial
and
solid
than
there
had
been
in
janet
suddenly
sam
began
wondering
whether
or
not
he
would
like
to
marry
sue
rainey
his
mind
played
with
the
idea
he
took
it
with
him
to
bed
and
it
went
with
him
all
day
in
his
hurried
trips
through
offices
and
shops
the
thought
having
come
to
him
persisted
and
he
began
seeing
her
in
a
new
light
the
odd
half
awkward
little
movements
of
her
hands
and
their
expressiveness
the
brown
fine
texture
of
her
cheeks
the
clearness
and
honesty
of
her
grey
eyes
the
quick
sympathy
and
understanding
of
his
feeling
for
janet
and
the
subtle
flattery
of
the
notion
he
had
got
that
she
was
interested
in
him
all
of
these
things
came
and
went
in
his
mind
while
he
ran
through
columns
of
figures
and
laid
plans
for
the
expansion
of
the
business
of
the
arms
company
unconsciously
he
began
to
make
her
a
part
of
his
plans
for
the
future
later
sam
discovered
that
during
the
days
after
the
first
talk
together
the
thought
of
a
marriage
between
them
was
in
sue
s
mind
also
after
the
talk
she
went
home
and
stood
for
an
hour
before
the
glass
studying
herself
and
she
once
told
sam
that
in
her
bed
that
night
she
shed
tears
because
she
had
never
been
able
to
arouse
in
a
man
the
note
of
tenderness
that
had
been
in
his
voice
when
he
talked
to
her
of
janet
and
then
two
months
after
the
first
talk
they
had
another
sam
who
had
not
allowed
his
grief
over
the
loss
of
janet
or
his
nightly
efforts
to
drown
the
sting
of
it
in
hard
drinking
to
check
the
big
forward
movement
that
he
felt
he
was
getting
into
the
work
of
the
offices
and
shops
sat
one
afternoon
deeply
absorbed
in
a
pile
of
factory
cost
sheets
his
shirt
sleeves
were
rolled
to
the
elbow
showing
his
white
muscular
forearms
he
was
absorbed
intent
upon
the
sheets
i
stepped
in
said
a
voice
above
his
head
glancing
up
quickly
sam
sprang
to
his
feet
she
must
have
been
there
some
minutes
looking
down
at
me
he
thought
and
had
a
thrill
of
pleasure
in
the
thought
into
his
mind
came
the
contents
of
the
letter
he
had
written
her
and
he
wondered
if
after
all
he
had
been
a
fool
and
whether
the
thoughts
of
a
marriage
with
her
were
but
vagaries
perhaps
it
would
not
be
attractive
to
either
her
or
myself
when
we
came
up
to
it
he
decided
i
stepped
in
she
began
again
i
have
been
thinking
some
things
you
said
in
the
letter
and
when
you
talked
of
your
friend
janet
who
died
some
things
of
men
and
women
and
work
you
may
not
remember
them
i
i
got
interested
i
are
you
a
socialist
i
believe
not
sam
answered
wondering
what
had
given
her
that
thought
are
you
she
laughed
and
shook
her
head
just
what
are
you
she
went
on
what
do
you
believe
i
am
curious
to
know
i
thought
your
note
you
will
pardon
me
i
thought
it
a
kind
of
sam
winced
a
shadow
of
doubt
of
the
sincerity
of
his
business
philosophy
crossed
his
mind
accompanied
by
the
swaggering
figure
of
windy
mcpherson
he
came
around
the
desk
and
leaning
against
it
looked
at
her
his
secretary
had
gone
out
of
the
room
and
they
were
alone
together
sam
laughed
there
was
a
man
in
the
town
where
i
was
raised
used
to
say
that
i
was
a
little
mole
working
underground
intent
upon
worms
he
said
and
then
waving
his
arms
toward
the
papers
on
the
desk
added
i
am
a
business
man
isn
t
that
enough
if
you
could
go
with
me
through
some
of
these
cost
sheets
you
would
agree
they
are
he
turned
and
faced
her
again
what
should
i
be
doing
with
beliefs
he
asked
well
i
think
you
have
them
some
kind
of
beliefs
she
insisted
you
must
have
them
you
get
things
done
you
should
hear
the
men
talk
of
you
sometimes
at
the
house
they
are
quite
foolish
about
what
a
wonderful
fellow
you
are
and
what
you
are
doing
here
they
say
that
you
drive
on
and
on
what
drives
you
i
want
to
for
the
moment
sam
half
suspected
that
she
was
secretly
laughing
at
him
finding
her
quite
serious
he
started
to
reply
and
then
stopped
regarding
her
the
silence
between
them
went
on
and
on
a
clock
on
the
wall
ticked
loudly
sam
stepped
nearer
to
her
and
stood
looking
down
into
the
face
she
slowly
turned
up
to
his
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
he
said
and
his
voice
broke
he
had
the
illusion
of
a
hand
gripping
at
his
throat
in
a
flash
he
had
definitely
decided
that
he
would
try
to
marry
her
her
interest
in
the
motives
of
his
life
had
clinched
the
sort
of
half
decision
he
had
made
in
an
illuminating
moment
during
the
prolonged
silence
between
them
he
had
seen
her
in
a
new
light
the
feeling
of
vague
intimacy
brought
to
him
by
his
thoughts
of
her
became
a
fixed
belief
that
she
belonged
to
him
was
a
part
of
him
and
he
was
charmed
with
her
manner
and
her
person
standing
there
as
with
a
gift
given
him
and
then
into
his
mind
came
a
hundred
other
thoughts
clamouring
thoughts
come
out
of
the
hidden
parts
of
him
he
began
to
think
that
she
could
lead
the
way
on
a
road
he
wanted
to
travel
he
thought
of
her
wealth
and
what
it
would
mean
to
a
man
filled
with
his
hunger
for
power
and
through
these
thoughts
shot
others
something
in
her
had
taken
hold
of
him
something
that
had
been
also
in
janet
he
was
curious
concerning
her
curiosity
about
his
beliefs
and
wanted
to
question
her
concerning
her
own
beliefs
he
could
see
none
of
colonel
tom
s
blustering
incompetence
in
her
and
thought
her
filled
with
truth
as
a
deep
spring
is
filled
with
clear
water
he
believed
she
would
give
him
something
something
that
all
his
life
he
had
been
wanting
an
old
aching
hunger
that
had
haunted
his
nights
as
a
boy
came
back
and
he
thought
that
at
her
hand
it
might
be
fed
i
i
must
read
a
book
about
socialism
he
said
lamely
again
they
stood
in
silence
she
looking
at
the
floor
he
past
her
head
and
out
at
the
window
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
again
of
the
proposed
talk
he
had
a
boyish
dread
of
having
her
notice
the
tremor
in
his
voice
colonel
tom
came
into
the
room
bursting
with
an
idea
sam
had
given
him
at
the
lunch
hour
and
which
in
working
its
way
into
his
mind
had
become
to
the
colonel
s
entirely
honest
belief
an
idea
of
his
own
the
interruption
brought
to
sam
an
intense
feeling
of
relief
and
he
began
talking
of
the
colonel
s
idea
as
though
it
had
taken
him
unawares
sue
walking
to
a
window
began
tying
and
untying
the
curtain
cord
when
sam
raising
his
eyes
looked
at
her
he
caught
her
eyes
watching
him
intently
and
she
smiled
continuing
to
look
at
him
squarely
it
was
his
eyes
that
first
broke
away
from
that
day
sam
s
mind
was
afire
with
thoughts
of
sue
rainey
in
his
room
he
sat
or
going
into
grant
park
stood
by
the
lake
looking
at
the
silent
moving
water
as
he
had
looked
in
the
days
when
he
first
came
to
the
city
he
did
not
dream
of
having
her
in
his
arms
or
of
kissing
her
lips
he
thought
instead
with
a
glowing
heart
of
a
life
lived
with
her
he
wanted
to
walk
beside
her
through
the
streets
to
have
her
come
suddenly
in
at
his
office
door
to
look
into
her
eyes
and
to
have
her
question
him
as
she
had
questioned
concerning
his
beliefs
and
his
hopes
he
thought
that
in
the
evening
he
would
like
to
go
to
a
house
of
his
own
and
find
her
sitting
there
waiting
for
him
all
the
charm
of
his
aimless
way
of
life
died
in
him
and
he
believed
that
with
her
he
could
begin
to
live
more
fully
and
completely
from
the
moment
when
he
had
definitely
decided
that
he
wanted
sue
as
a
wife
sam
stopped
overdrinking
going
to
his
room
or
walking
through
the
streets
or
in
the
parks
instead
of
seeking
his
old
companions
in
the
clubs
and
drinking
places
sometimes
pushing
his
bed
to
the
window
overlooking
the
lake
he
would
undress
immediately
after
dinner
and
opening
the
window
would
spend
half
the
night
watching
the
lights
of
boats
far
away
over
the
water
and
thinking
of
her
he
would
imagine
her
in
the
room
moving
here
and
there
and
coming
occasionally
to
put
her
hand
in
his
hair
and
look
down
at
him
as
janet
had
done
helping
by
her
sane
talk
and
quiet
ways
to
get
his
life
straightened
out
for
good
living
and
when
he
had
fallen
asleep
the
face
of
sue
rainey
came
to
visit
his
dreams
one
night
he
thought
she
had
become
blind
and
sat
in
the
room
with
sightless
eyes
saying
over
and
over
like
one
demented
truth
truth
give
me
back
the
truth
that
i
may
see
and
he
awoke
sick
with
horror
at
the
thought
of
the
look
of
suffering
that
had
been
in
her
face
never
did
sam
dream
of
having
her
in
his
arms
or
of
raining
kisses
on
her
lips
and
neck
as
he
had
dreamed
of
other
women
who
in
the
past
had
won
his
favour
for
all
that
he
thought
of
her
so
constantly
and
built
so
confidently
his
dream
of
a
life
to
be
spent
with
her
months
passed
before
he
saw
her
again
through
colonel
tom
he
learned
that
she
had
gone
for
a
visit
to
the
east
and
he
went
earnestly
about
his
work
keeping
his
mind
on
his
business
during
the
day
and
only
in
the
evening
allowing
himself
to
become
absorbed
in
thoughts
of
her
he
had
a
feeling
that
although
he
had
said
nothing
she
knew
of
his
desire
for
her
and
that
she
wanted
time
to
think
it
over
several
times
in
the
evening
in
his
room
he
wrote
her
long
letters
filled
with
minute
boyish
explanations
of
his
thoughts
and
motives
letters
which
after
writing
he
immediately
destroyed
a
woman
of
the
west
side
with
whom
he
had
once
had
an
affair
met
him
one
day
on
the
street
and
put
her
hand
familiarly
on
his
arm
and
for
the
moment
reawakened
in
him
an
old
desire
after
leaving
her
he
did
not
go
back
to
the
office
but
taking
a
car
spent
the
afternoon
walking
in
jackson
park
watching
the
children
at
play
on
the
grass
sitting
on
benches
under
the
trees
getting
out
of
his
body
and
his
mind
the
insistent
call
of
the
flesh
that
had
come
back
to
him
then
in
the
evening
he
came
suddenly
upon
sue
riding
a
spirited
black
horse
in
a
bridle
path
at
the
upper
end
of
the
park
it
was
just
at
the
grey
beginning
of
night
stopping
the
horse
she
sat
looking
at
him
and
going
to
her
he
put
a
hand
on
the
bridle
we
might
have
that
talk
he
said
she
smiled
down
at
him
and
the
colour
began
to
rise
in
her
brown
cheeks
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
she
said
the
familiar
serious
look
coming
into
her
eyes
after
all
what
have
we
to
say
to
each
other
sam
watched
her
steadily
i
have
a
lot
of
things
to
say
to
you
he
announced
that
is
to
say
well
i
have
if
things
are
as
i
she
got
off
the
horse
and
they
stood
together
by
the
side
of
the
path
sam
never
forgot
the
few
minutes
of
silence
that
followed
the
wide
prospects
of
green
sward
the
golf
player
trudging
wearily
toward
them
through
the
uncertain
light
his
bag
upon
his
shoulder
the
air
of
physical
fatigue
with
which
he
walked
bending
slightly
forward
the
faint
soft
sound
of
waves
washing
over
a
low
beach
and
the
intense
waiting
look
on
the
face
she
turned
up
to
him
made
an
impression
on
his
mind
that
stayed
with
him
through
life
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
arrived
at
a
kind
of
culmination
a
starting
point
and
that
all
the
vague
shadowy
uncertainties
that
had
in
reflective
moments
flitted
through
his
mind
were
to
be
brushed
away
by
some
act
some
word
from
the
lips
of
this
woman
with
a
rush
he
realised
how
consistently
he
had
been
thinking
of
her
and
how
enormously
he
had
been
counting
on
her
falling
in
with
his
plans
and
the
realisation
was
followed
by
a
sickening
moment
of
fear
how
little
he
actually
knew
of
her
and
of
her
way
of
thought
what
assurance
had
he
that
she
would
not
laugh
jump
back
upon
the
horse
and
ride
away
he
was
afraid
as
he
had
never
been
afraid
before
dumbly
his
mind
groped
about
for
a
way
to
begin
expressions
he
had
caught
and
noted
in
her
strong
serious
little
face
when
he
had
achieved
but
a
mild
curiosity
concerning
her
came
back
to
visit
his
mind
and
he
tried
desperately
to
build
an
instant
idea
of
her
from
these
and
then
turning
his
face
from
her
he
plunged
directly
into
his
thoughts
of
the
past
months
as
though
she
had
been
sharing
talking
to
the
colonel
i
have
been
thinking
we
might
marry
you
and
i
he
said
and
cursed
himself
for
the
blundering
bluntness
of
the
declaration
you
do
get
things
done
don
t
you
she
replied
smiling
why
should
you
have
been
thinking
anything
of
the
sort
because
i
want
to
live
with
you
he
said
i
have
been
talking
to
the
about
marrying
me
she
seemed
about
to
begin
laughing
he
hurried
on
no
not
that
we
talked
about
you
i
could
not
let
him
alone
he
might
have
known
i
kept
making
him
talk
i
made
him
tell
me
about
your
ideas
i
felt
i
had
to
sam
faced
her
he
thinks
your
ideas
absurd
i
do
not
i
like
them
i
like
you
i
think
you
are
beautiful
i
do
not
know
whether
i
love
you
or
not
but
for
weeks
i
have
been
thinking
of
you
and
clinging
to
you
and
saying
over
and
over
to
myself
i
want
to
live
my
life
with
sue
i
did
not
expect
to
go
at
it
this
way
you
know
me
what
you
do
not
know
i
will
tell
sam
mcpherson
you
are
a
wonder
she
said
and
i
do
not
know
but
that
i
will
marry
you
in
the
end
but
i
can
t
tell
now
i
want
to
know
a
lot
of
things
i
want
to
know
if
you
are
ready
to
believe
what
i
believe
and
to
live
for
what
i
want
to
the
horse
growing
restless
began
tugging
at
the
bridle
and
she
spoke
to
him
sharply
she
plunged
into
a
description
of
a
man
she
had
seen
on
the
lecture
platform
during
her
visit
to
the
east
and
sam
looked
at
her
with
puzzled
eyes
he
was
beautiful
she
said
he
was
past
sixty
but
looked
like
a
boy
of
not
in
his
body
but
in
an
air
of
youth
that
hung
over
him
he
stood
there
before
the
people
talking
quiet
able
efficient
he
was
clean
he
had
lived
clean
body
and
mind
he
had
been
companion
and
with
william
morris
and
once
he
had
been
a
mine
boy
in
wales
but
he
had
got
hold
of
a
vision
and
lived
for
it
i
did
not
hear
what
he
said
but
i
kept
thinking
i
want
a
man
like
can
you
accept
my
beliefs
and
live
for
what
i
want
to
live
she
persisted
sam
looked
at
the
ground
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
going
to
lose
her
that
she
would
not
marry
him
i
am
not
accepting
beliefs
or
ends
in
life
blindly
he
said
stoutly
but
i
want
them
what
are
your
beliefs
i
want
to
know
i
think
i
haven
t
any
myself
when
i
reach
for
them
they
are
gone
my
mind
shifts
and
changes
i
want
something
solid
i
like
solid
things
i
want
when
can
we
meet
and
talk
everything
over
thoroughly
now
answered
sam
bluntly
some
look
in
her
face
changing
his
whole
viewpoint
suddenly
it
seemed
as
though
a
door
had
been
opened
letting
in
a
strong
light
upon
the
darkness
of
his
mind
his
confidence
had
come
back
to
him
he
wanted
to
strike
and
keep
on
striking
the
blood
rushed
through
his
body
and
his
brain
began
working
rapidly
he
felt
sure
of
ultimate
success
taking
her
hand
and
leading
the
horse
he
began
walking
with
her
along
the
path
her
hand
trembled
in
his
and
as
though
answering
a
thought
in
his
mind
she
looked
up
at
him
and
said
i
am
not
different
from
other
women
although
i
do
not
accept
your
offer
this
is
a
big
moment
for
me
perhaps
the
biggest
moment
of
my
life
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
feel
that
though
i
do
want
certain
things
more
than
i
want
you
or
any
other
there
was
a
suggestion
of
tears
in
her
voice
and
sam
had
a
feeling
that
the
woman
in
her
wanted
him
to
take
her
into
his
arms
but
something
within
him
told
him
to
wait
and
to
help
her
by
waiting
like
her
he
wanted
something
more
than
the
feel
of
a
woman
in
his
arms
ideas
rushed
through
his
head
he
thought
that
she
was
going
to
give
him
some
bigger
idea
than
he
had
known
the
figure
she
had
drawn
for
him
of
the
old
man
who
stood
on
the
platform
young
and
beautiful
the
old
boyish
need
of
a
purpose
in
life
the
dreams
of
the
last
few
weeks
all
of
these
were
a
part
of
the
eager
curiosity
in
him
they
were
like
hungry
little
animals
waiting
to
be
fed
we
must
have
it
all
out
here
and
now
he
told
himself
i
must
not
let
myself
be
swept
away
by
a
rush
of
feeling
and
i
must
not
let
her
be
do
not
think
he
said
that
i
haven
t
tenderness
for
you
i
am
filled
with
it
but
i
want
to
have
our
talk
i
want
to
know
what
you
expect
me
to
believe
and
how
you
want
me
to
he
felt
her
hand
stiffen
in
his
whether
or
not
we
are
worth
while
to
each
other
she
added
yes
he
said
and
then
she
began
to
talk
telling
him
in
a
quiet
steady
voice
that
steadied
something
in
him
what
she
wanted
to
make
out
of
her
life
her
idea
was
one
of
service
to
mankind
through
children
she
had
seen
girl
friends
of
hers
with
whom
she
had
gone
to
school
grow
up
and
marry
they
had
wealth
and
education
fine
bodies
and
they
had
been
married
only
to
live
lives
more
fully
devoted
to
pleasure
one
or
two
who
had
married
poor
men
had
only
done
so
to
satisfy
a
passion
in
themselves
and
after
marriage
had
joined
the
others
in
the
hungry
pursuit
of
pleasure
they
do
nothing
at
all
she
said
to
repay
the
world
for
the
things
given
them
the
wealth
and
bodies
and
the
disciplined
minds
they
go
through
life
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
wasting
themselves
and
come
in
the
end
to
nothing
but
indolent
slovenly
she
had
thought
it
all
out
and
had
tried
to
plan
for
herself
a
life
with
other
ends
and
wanted
a
husband
in
accord
with
her
ideas
that
isn
t
so
difficult
she
said
i
can
find
a
man
whom
i
can
control
and
who
will
believe
as
i
believe
my
money
gives
me
that
power
but
i
want
him
to
be
a
real
man
a
man
of
ability
a
man
who
does
things
for
himself
one
fitted
by
his
life
and
his
achievements
to
be
the
father
of
children
who
do
things
and
so
i
began
thinking
about
you
i
got
the
men
who
come
to
the
house
to
talk
of
she
hung
her
head
and
laughed
like
a
bashful
boy
i
know
much
of
the
story
of
your
early
life
out
in
that
iowa
town
she
said
i
got
the
story
of
your
life
and
your
achievements
out
there
from
some
one
who
knew
you
the
idea
seemed
wonderfully
simple
and
beautiful
to
sam
it
seemed
to
add
tremendously
to
the
dignity
and
nobility
of
his
feeling
for
her
he
stopped
in
the
path
and
swung
her
about
facing
him
they
were
alone
in
that
end
of
the
park
the
soft
darkness
of
the
summer
night
had
settled
over
them
in
the
grass
at
their
feet
a
cricket
sang
loudly
he
made
a
movement
to
take
her
into
his
arms
it
is
wonderful
he
said
wait
she
demanded
putting
her
hand
against
his
shoulder
it
isn
t
so
simple
i
am
wealthy
you
are
able
and
you
have
a
kind
of
undying
energy
in
you
i
want
to
give
both
my
wealth
and
your
ability
to
children
our
children
that
will
not
be
easy
for
you
it
means
giving
up
your
dreams
of
power
perhaps
i
shall
lose
courage
women
do
after
two
or
three
have
come
you
will
have
to
furnish
that
you
will
have
to
make
a
mother
of
me
and
keep
making
a
mother
of
me
you
will
have
to
be
a
new
kind
of
father
with
something
maternal
in
you
you
will
have
to
be
patient
and
studious
and
kind
you
will
have
to
think
of
these
things
at
night
instead
of
thinking
of
your
own
advancement
you
will
have
to
live
wholly
for
me
because
i
am
to
be
their
mother
giving
me
your
strength
and
courage
and
your
good
sane
outlook
on
things
and
then
when
they
come
you
will
have
to
give
all
these
things
to
them
day
after
day
in
a
thousand
little
sam
took
her
into
his
arms
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
memory
the
hot
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
the
horse
unattended
wheeled
threw
up
his
head
and
trotted
off
down
the
path
they
let
him
go
walking
along
after
him
hand
in
hand
like
two
happy
children
at
the
entrance
to
the
park
they
came
up
to
him
held
by
a
park
policeman
she
got
on
the
horse
and
sam
stood
beside
her
looking
up
i
ll
tell
the
colonel
in
the
morning
he
said
what
will
he
say
she
murmured
musingly
damned
ingrate
sam
mimicked
the
colonel
s
blustering
throat
tones
she
laughed
and
picked
up
the
reins
sam
laid
his
hand
on
hers
how
soon
he
asked
she
put
her
head
down
near
his
we
ll
waste
no
time
she
said
blushing
and
then
in
the
presence
of
a
park
policeman
in
the
street
by
the
entrance
to
the
park
with
the
people
passing
up
and
down
sam
had
his
first
kiss
from
sue
rainey
s
lips
after
she
rode
away
sam
walked
he
had
no
sense
of
the
passing
of
time
wandering
through
street
after
street
rearranging
and
readjusting
his
outlook
on
life
what
she
had
said
had
stirred
every
vestige
of
sleeping
nobility
in
him
he
thought
that
he
had
got
hold
of
the
thing
he
had
unconsciously
been
seeking
all
his
life
his
dreams
of
control
of
the
rainey
arms
company
and
the
other
big
things
he
had
planned
in
business
seemed
in
the
light
of
their
talk
so
much
nonsense
and
vanity
i
will
live
for
this
i
will
live
for
this
he
kept
saying
over
and
over
to
himself
he
imagined
he
could
see
the
little
white
things
lying
in
sue
s
arms
and
his
new
love
for
her
and
for
what
they
were
to
accomplish
together
ran
through
him
and
hurt
him
so
that
he
felt
like
shouting
in
the
darkened
streets
he
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
saw
the
stars
and
thought
they
looked
down
on
two
new
and
glorious
beings
living
on
the
earth
at
a
corner
he
turned
and
came
into
a
quiet
residence
street
where
frame
houses
stood
in
the
midst
of
little
green
lawns
and
thoughts
of
his
boyhood
in
the
iowa
town
came
back
to
him
and
then
his
mind
moving
forward
he
remembered
nights
in
the
city
when
he
had
stolen
away
to
the
arms
of
women
hot
shame
burned
in
his
cheeks
and
his
eyes
felt
hot
i
must
go
to
her
i
must
go
to
her
at
her
house
now
tonight
and
tell
her
all
of
these
things
and
beg
her
to
forgive
me
he
thought
and
then
the
absurdity
of
such
a
course
striking
him
he
laughed
aloud
it
cleanses
me
this
cleanses
me
he
said
to
himself
he
remembered
the
men
who
had
sat
about
the
stove
in
wildman
s
grocery
when
he
was
a
boy
and
the
stories
they
sometimes
told
he
remembered
how
he
as
a
boy
in
the
city
had
run
through
the
crowded
streets
fleeing
from
the
terror
of
lust
he
began
to
understand
how
distorted
how
strangely
perverted
his
whole
attitude
toward
women
and
sex
had
been
sex
is
a
solution
not
a
menace
it
is
wonderful
he
told
himself
without
knowing
fully
the
meaning
of
the
word
that
had
sprung
to
his
lips
when
at
last
he
turned
into
michigan
avenue
and
went
toward
his
apartment
the
late
moon
was
just
mounting
the
sky
and
a
clock
in
one
of
the
sleeping
houses
was
striking
three
chapter
vi
one
evening
six
weeks
after
the
talk
in
the
gathering
darkness
in
jackson
park
sue
rainey
and
sam
mcpherson
sat
on
the
deck
of
a
lake
michigan
steamer
watching
the
lights
of
chicago
blink
out
in
the
distance
they
had
been
married
that
afternoon
in
colonel
tom
s
big
house
on
the
south
side
and
now
they
sat
on
the
deck
of
the
boat
being
carried
out
into
darkness
vowed
to
motherhood
and
to
fatherhood
each
more
or
less
afraid
of
the
other
they
sat
in
silence
looking
at
the
blinking
lights
and
listening
to
the
low
voices
of
their
fellow
passengers
also
sitting
in
the
chairs
along
the
deck
or
strolling
leisurely
about
and
to
the
wash
of
the
water
along
the
sides
of
the
boat
eager
to
break
down
a
little
reserve
that
the
solemnity
of
the
marriage
service
had
built
up
between
them
a
picture
floated
in
sam
s
mind
he
saw
sue
all
in
white
radiant
and
wonderful
coming
toward
him
down
a
broad
stairway
toward
him
the
newsboy
of
caxton
the
smuggler
of
game
the
roisterer
the
greedy
moneygetter
all
during
those
six
weeks
he
had
been
waiting
for
this
hour
when
he
should
sit
beside
the
little
figure
getting
from
her
the
help
he
wanted
in
the
reconstruction
of
his
life
without
being
able
to
talk
as
he
had
thought
of
talking
he
yet
felt
assured
and
easy
in
his
mind
in
the
moment
when
she
had
come
down
the
stairway
he
had
been
half
overcome
by
a
feeling
of
intense
shame
a
return
of
the
shame
that
had
swept
over
him
that
night
when
she
had
given
her
word
and
he
had
walked
hour
after
hour
through
the
streets
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
from
among
the
guests
standing
about
should
arise
a
voice
crying
stop
do
not
go
on
let
me
tell
you
of
this
fellow
this
mcpherson
and
then
he
had
seen
her
holding
to
the
arm
of
swaggering
pretentious
colonel
tom
and
he
had
taken
her
hand
to
become
one
with
her
two
curious
feverish
strangely
different
human
beings
taking
a
vow
in
the
name
of
their
god
with
the
flowers
banked
about
them
and
the
eyes
of
people
upon
them
when
sam
had
gone
to
colonel
tom
the
morning
after
that
evening
in
jackson
park
there
had
been
a
scene
the
old
gun
maker
had
blustered
and
roared
and
forbidden
pounding
on
his
desk
with
his
fist
when
sam
remained
cool
and
unimpressed
he
had
stormed
out
of
the
room
slamming
the
door
and
shouting
upstart
damned
upstart
and
sam
had
gone
smiling
back
to
his
desk
mildly
disappointed
i
told
sue
he
would
say
ingrate
he
thought
i
am
losing
my
skill
at
guessing
just
what
he
will
do
and
the
colonel
s
rage
had
been
within
a
week
he
was
boasting
of
sam
to
chance
callers
as
the
best
business
man
in
america
and
in
the
face
of
a
solemn
promise
given
sue
was
telling
news
of
the
approaching
marriage
to
every
newspaper
man
he
knew
sam
suspected
him
of
secretly
calling
on
the
telephone
those
newspapers
whose
representatives
had
not
crossed
his
trail
during
the
six
waiting
weeks
there
had
been
little
of
love
making
between
sue
and
sam
they
had
talked
instead
or
going
into
the
country
or
to
the
parks
had
walked
under
the
trees
consumed
with
a
curious
eager
passion
of
suspense
the
idea
she
had
given
him
in
the
park
grew
in
sam
s
brain
to
live
for
the
young
things
that
would
presently
come
to
them
to
be
simple
direct
and
natural
like
the
trees
or
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
then
to
have
the
native
honesty
of
such
a
life
illuminated
and
ennobled
by
a
mutual
intelligent
purpose
to
make
their
young
something
finer
and
better
than
the
things
in
nature
by
the
intelligent
use
of
their
own
good
minds
and
bodies
in
the
shops
and
on
the
streets
the
hurrying
men
and
women
took
on
a
new
significance
to
him
he
wondered
what
secret
mighty
purpose
might
be
in
their
lives
and
read
a
newspaper
report
of
an
engagement
or
a
marriage
with
a
little
jump
of
the
heart
he
looked
at
the
girls
and
the
women
at
work
over
the
typewriting
machines
in
the
office
with
questioning
eyes
asking
himself
why
they
did
not
seek
marriage
openly
and
determinedly
and
saw
a
healthy
single
woman
as
so
much
wasted
material
as
a
machine
for
producing
healthy
new
life
standing
idle
and
unused
in
the
great
workshop
of
the
universe
marriage
is
a
port
a
beginning
a
point
of
departure
from
which
men
and
women
go
forth
upon
the
real
voyage
of
life
he
told
sue
one
evening
as
they
walked
in
the
park
all
that
goes
before
is
but
a
preparation
a
building
the
pains
and
the
triumphs
of
all
unmarried
people
are
but
the
good
oak
planks
being
driven
into
place
to
make
the
vessel
fit
for
the
real
or
again
one
night
when
they
were
in
a
rowboat
on
the
lagoon
in
the
park
and
all
about
them
in
the
darkness
was
the
plash
of
oars
in
the
water
the
screams
of
excited
girls
and
the
sound
of
voices
calling
he
let
the
boat
float
in
against
the
shores
of
a
little
island
and
crept
along
the
boat
to
kneel
with
his
head
in
her
lap
and
whisper
it
is
not
the
love
of
a
woman
that
grips
me
sue
but
the
love
of
life
i
have
had
a
peep
into
the
great
mystery
this
this
is
why
we
are
here
this
justifies
now
that
she
sat
beside
him
her
shoulder
against
his
own
being
carried
away
with
him
into
darkness
and
privacy
the
personal
side
of
his
love
for
her
ran
through
sam
like
a
flame
and
turning
he
drew
her
head
down
upon
his
shoulder
not
yet
sam
she
whispered
not
with
these
hundreds
of
people
sleeping
and
drinking
and
thinking
and
going
about
their
affairs
almost
within
touch
of
our
they
got
up
and
walked
along
the
swaying
deck
out
of
the
north
the
clean
wind
called
to
them
the
stars
looked
down
upon
them
and
in
the
darkness
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
they
parted
for
the
night
silently
speechless
with
happiness
and
with
a
dear
unmentioned
secret
between
them
at
dawn
they
landed
at
a
little
lumbering
town
where
boat
blankets
and
camping
kit
had
gone
before
a
river
flowed
down
out
of
the
woods
passing
the
town
going
under
a
bridge
and
turning
the
wheel
of
a
sawmill
that
stood
by
the
shore
of
the
river
facing
the
lake
the
clean
sweet
smell
of
the
logs
the
song
of
the
saws
the
roar
of
the
water
tumbling
over
a
dam
the
cries
of
the
lumbermen
working
among
the
floating
logs
above
the
dam
filled
the
morning
air
and
above
the
song
of
the
saws
sang
another
song
a
breathless
waiting
song
the
song
of
love
and
of
life
singing
in
the
hearts
of
husband
and
wife
in
a
little
lumberman
s
hotel
they
ate
breakfast
in
a
room
overlooking
the
river
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
a
large
woman
in
a
clean
calico
dress
was
expecting
them
and
having
served
the
breakfast
went
out
of
the
room
grinning
good
naturedly
and
closing
the
door
behind
her
through
the
open
window
they
looked
at
the
cold
river
and
at
a
boy
who
carried
packages
wrapped
in
blankets
and
put
them
in
a
long
canoe
tied
to
a
little
wharf
beside
the
hotel
they
ate
and
sat
staring
at
each
other
like
two
strange
boys
saying
nothing
sam
ate
little
his
heart
pounded
in
his
breast
on
the
river
he
sank
his
paddle
deep
into
the
water
pulling
against
the
current
during
the
six
weeks
waiting
in
chicago
she
had
taught
him
the
essentials
of
the
canoeist
s
art
and
now
as
he
shot
the
canoe
under
the
bridge
and
around
a
bend
of
the
river
out
of
sight
of
the
town
a
superhuman
strength
seemed
in
his
arms
and
back
before
him
in
the
prow
of
the
boat
sat
sue
her
straight
muscular
little
back
bending
and
straightening
again
by
his
side
rose
towering
hills
clothed
with
pine
trees
and
piles
of
cut
logs
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
along
the
shore
at
sunset
they
landed
in
a
little
cleared
space
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
and
on
the
top
of
the
hill
with
the
wind
blowing
across
it
they
made
their
first
camp
sam
brought
boughs
and
spread
them
lapped
like
feathers
in
the
wings
of
a
bird
and
carried
blankets
up
the
hill
while
sue
at
the
foot
near
the
overturned
boat
built
a
fire
and
prepared
their
first
cooked
meal
out
of
doors
in
the
failing
light
sue
got
out
her
rifle
and
gave
sam
his
first
lesson
in
marksmanship
his
awkwardness
making
the
lesson
half
a
jest
and
then
in
the
soft
stillness
of
the
young
night
with
the
first
stars
coming
into
the
sky
and
the
clean
cold
wind
blowing
into
their
faces
they
went
arm
in
arm
up
the
hill
under
the
trees
to
where
the
tops
of
the
trees
rolled
and
pitched
like
the
stormy
waters
of
a
great
sea
before
their
eyes
and
lay
down
together
for
their
first
long
tender
embrace
there
is
a
special
kind
of
fine
pleasure
in
getting
one
s
first
knowledge
of
the
great
outdoors
in
the
company
of
a
woman
a
man
loves
and
to
have
that
woman
an
expert
with
a
keen
appetite
for
the
life
adds
point
and
flavour
to
the
experience
in
his
busy
striving
boyhood
in
the
town
surrounded
by
hot
cornfields
and
in
his
young
manhood
of
scheming
and
money
hunger
in
the
city
sam
had
not
thought
of
vacations
and
resting
places
he
had
walked
on
country
roads
with
john
telfer
and
mary
underwood
listening
to
their
talk
absorbing
their
ideas
blind
and
deaf
to
the
little
life
in
the
grass
in
the
leafy
branches
of
the
trees
and
in
the
air
about
him
in
clubs
and
about
hotels
and
barrooms
in
the
city
he
had
heard
men
talk
of
life
in
the
open
and
had
said
to
himself
when
my
time
comes
i
will
taste
these
and
now
he
did
taste
them
lying
on
his
back
on
the
grass
along
the
river
floating
down
quiet
little
side
streams
in
the
moonlight
listening
to
the
night
call
of
birds
or
watching
the
flight
of
frightened
wild
things
as
he
pushed
the
canoe
into
the
quiet
depths
of
the
great
forest
about
them
at
night
under
the
little
tent
they
had
brought
or
beneath
the
blankets
under
the
stars
he
slept
lightly
awakening
often
to
look
at
sue
lying
beside
him
perhaps
the
wind
had
blown
a
wisp
of
hair
across
her
face
and
her
breath
played
with
it
tossing
it
about
perhaps
just
the
quiet
of
her
expressive
little
face
charmed
and
held
him
so
that
he
turned
reluctantly
to
sleep
again
thinking
that
he
might
with
pleasure
go
on
looking
at
her
all
night
for
sue
the
days
also
passed
lightly
she
also
awoke
in
the
night
and
lay
looking
at
the
man
sleeping
beside
her
and
once
she
told
sam
that
when
he
awoke
she
feigned
sleep
dreading
to
rob
him
of
the
pleasure
that
she
knew
these
secret
love
passages
gave
to
both
they
were
not
alone
in
those
northern
woods
everywhere
along
the
rivers
and
on
the
shores
of
little
lakes
they
found
people
to
sam
a
new
kind
of
people
who
dropped
all
the
ordinary
things
of
life
and
ran
away
to
the
woods
and
the
streams
to
spend
long
happy
months
in
the
open
he
discovered
with
surprise
that
these
adventurers
were
men
of
modest
fortunes
small
manufacturers
skilled
workingmen
retail
merchants
one
with
whom
he
talked
was
a
grocer
from
a
town
in
ohio
and
when
sam
asked
him
if
the
coming
to
the
woods
with
his
family
for
an
stay
did
not
endanger
the
success
of
his
business
he
agreed
with
sam
that
it
did
nodding
his
head
and
laughing
but
there
would
be
a
lot
more
danger
in
not
leaving
it
he
said
the
danger
of
having
my
boys
grow
up
to
be
men
without
my
having
any
real
fun
with
among
all
of
the
people
they
met
sue
passed
with
a
sort
of
happy
freedom
that
confounded
sam
as
he
had
formed
a
habit
of
thinking
of
her
always
as
one
shut
within
herself
many
of
the
people
they
saw
she
knew
and
he
came
to
believe
that
she
had
chosen
the
place
for
their
love
making
because
she
admired
and
held
in
high
favour
the
lives
of
these
people
of
the
and
wanted
her
lover
to
be
in
some
way
like
them
out
of
the
solitude
of
the
woods
along
the
shores
of
little
lakes
they
called
to
her
as
she
passed
demanding
that
she
come
ashore
and
show
her
husband
and
among
them
she
sat
talking
of
other
seasons
and
of
the
inroads
of
the
lumber
men
upon
their
paradise
the
burnhams
were
this
year
on
the
shores
of
grant
lake
the
two
school
teachers
from
pittsburgh
would
come
early
in
august
the
detroit
man
with
the
crippled
son
was
building
a
cabin
on
the
shores
of
bone
sam
sat
among
them
in
silence
renewing
constantly
his
admiration
for
the
wonder
of
sue
s
past
life
she
the
daughter
of
colonel
tom
the
woman
rich
in
her
own
right
to
have
made
her
friends
among
these
people
she
who
had
been
pronounced
an
enigma
by
the
young
men
of
chicago
to
have
been
secretly
all
of
these
years
the
companion
and
fellow
spirit
of
these
campers
by
the
lakes
for
six
weeks
they
led
a
wandering
nomadic
life
in
that
half
wild
land
for
sue
six
weeks
of
tender
love
making
and
of
the
expression
of
every
thought
and
impulse
of
her
fine
nature
for
sam
six
weeks
of
readjustment
and
freedom
during
which
he
learned
to
sail
a
boat
to
shoot
and
to
get
the
fine
taste
of
that
life
into
his
being
and
then
one
morning
they
came
again
to
the
little
lumber
town
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
sat
upon
the
pier
waiting
for
the
chicago
boat
they
were
bound
once
more
into
the
world
and
to
that
life
together
that
was
the
foundation
of
their
marriage
and
that
was
to
be
the
end
and
aim
of
their
two
lives
if
sam
s
life
from
boyhood
had
been
on
the
whole
barren
and
empty
of
many
of
the
sweeter
things
his
life
during
the
next
year
was
strikingly
full
and
complete
in
the
office
he
had
ceased
being
the
pushing
upstart
tramping
on
the
toes
of
tradition
and
had
become
the
son
of
colonel
tom
the
voter
of
sue
s
big
stock
holdings
the
practical
directing
head
and
genius
of
the
destinies
of
the
company
jack
prince
s
loyalty
had
been
rewarded
and
a
huge
advertising
campaign
made
the
name
and
merits
of
the
rainey
arms
company
s
wares
known
to
all
reading
americans
the
muzzles
of
rifles
revolvers
and
shotguns
looked
threateningly
out
at
one
from
the
pages
of
the
great
popular
magazines
brown
hunters
did
brave
deeds
before
one
s
eyes
kneeling
upon
crags
preparing
to
speed
winged
death
to
waiting
mountain
sheep
huge
bears
rushed
down
from
among
the
type
at
the
top
of
the
pages
and
seemed
about
to
devour
cool
deliberate
sportsmen
who
stood
undaunted
swinging
their
trusty
into
place
and
presidents
explorers
and
texas
gun
fighters
loudly
proclaimed
the
merits
of
to
a
world
it
was
for
sam
and
for
colonel
tom
a
time
of
big
dividends
mechanical
progress
and
contentment
sam
stayed
diligently
at
work
in
the
offices
and
in
the
shops
but
kept
within
himself
a
reserve
of
strength
and
resolution
that
might
have
gone
into
the
work
with
sue
he
took
up
golf
and
morning
rides
on
horseback
and
with
sue
he
sat
during
the
long
evenings
reading
aloud
absorbing
her
ideas
and
her
beliefs
sometimes
for
days
they
were
like
two
children
going
off
together
to
walk
on
country
roads
and
to
sleep
in
country
hotels
on
these
walks
they
went
hand
in
hand
or
bantering
each
other
raced
down
long
hills
to
lie
panting
in
the
grass
by
the
roadside
when
they
were
out
of
breath
near
the
end
of
the
first
year
she
told
him
one
night
of
the
realisation
of
their
hopes
and
they
sat
through
the
evening
alone
by
the
fire
in
her
room
filled
with
the
white
wonder
of
it
renewing
to
each
other
all
the
fine
vows
of
their
early
days
sam
never
succeeded
in
recapturing
the
flavour
of
those
days
happiness
is
a
thing
so
vague
so
indefinite
so
dependent
on
a
thousand
little
turns
of
the
events
of
the
day
that
it
only
visits
the
most
fortunate
and
at
rare
intervals
but
sam
thought
that
he
and
sue
touched
almost
ideal
happiness
constantly
during
that
time
there
were
weeks
and
even
months
of
their
first
year
together
that
later
passed
out
of
sam
s
memory
entirely
leaving
only
a
sense
of
completeness
and
well
being
he
could
remember
perhaps
a
winter
walk
in
the
moonlight
by
the
frozen
lake
or
a
visitor
who
sat
and
talked
an
evening
away
by
their
fire
but
at
the
end
he
had
to
come
back
to
this
that
something
sang
in
his
heart
all
day
long
and
that
the
air
tasted
better
the
stars
shone
more
brightly
and
the
wind
and
the
rain
and
the
hail
upon
the
window
panes
sang
more
sweetly
in
his
ears
he
and
the
woman
who
lived
with
him
had
wealth
position
and
infinite
delight
in
the
presence
and
the
persons
of
each
other
and
a
great
idea
burned
like
a
lamp
in
a
window
at
the
end
of
the
road
they
travelled
meanwhile
in
the
world
about
him
events
came
and
went
a
president
was
elected
the
grey
wolves
were
being
hunted
out
of
the
chicago
city
council
and
a
strong
rival
to
his
company
flourished
in
his
own
city
in
other
days
he
would
have
been
down
upon
this
rival
fighting
planning
working
for
its
destruction
now
he
sat
at
sue
s
feet
dreaming
and
talking
to
her
of
the
brood
that
under
their
care
should
grow
into
wonderful
reliant
men
and
women
when
lewis
the
talented
sales
manager
of
the
edwards
arms
company
got
the
business
of
a
kansas
city
jobber
he
smiled
wrote
a
sharp
letter
to
his
man
in
that
territory
and
went
for
an
afternoon
of
golf
with
sue
he
had
completely
and
wholly
accepted
sue
s
conception
of
life
we
have
wealth
for
any
emergency
he
said
to
himself
and
we
will
live
our
lives
for
service
to
mankind
through
the
children
that
will
presently
come
into
our
after
their
marriage
sam
found
that
sue
for
all
her
apparent
coldness
and
indifference
had
in
chicago
as
in
the
northern
woods
her
own
little
circle
of
men
and
women
some
of
these
people
sam
had
met
during
the
engagement
and
now
they
began
gradually
coming
to
the
house
for
an
evening
with
the
mcphersons
sometimes
there
would
be
several
of
them
for
a
quiet
dinner
at
which
there
was
much
good
talk
and
after
which
sue
and
sam
sat
for
half
the
night
continuing
some
vein
of
thought
brought
to
them
among
the
people
who
came
to
them
sam
shone
resplendent
in
some
indefinable
way
he
thought
they
paid
court
to
him
and
the
thought
flattered
him
immensely
the
college
professor
who
had
talked
brilliantly
through
an
evening
turned
to
sam
for
approval
of
his
conclusions
a
writer
of
tales
of
cowboy
life
asked
him
to
help
him
over
a
difficulty
in
the
stock
market
and
a
tall
painter
paid
him
the
rare
compliment
of
repeating
one
of
sam
s
remarks
as
his
own
it
was
as
though
in
spite
of
their
talk
they
thought
him
the
most
gifted
of
them
all
and
for
a
time
he
was
puzzled
by
their
attitude
jack
prince
came
sat
at
one
of
the
dinner
parties
and
explained
you
have
got
what
they
want
and
can
not
get
the
money
he
said
after
the
evening
when
sue
told
him
the
great
news
they
gave
a
dinner
it
was
a
sort
of
welcoming
party
for
the
coming
guest
and
while
the
people
at
the
table
ate
and
talked
sue
and
sam
from
opposite
ends
of
the
table
lifted
high
their
glasses
and
looking
into
each
other
s
eyes
drank
off
the
health
of
him
who
was
to
come
the
first
of
the
great
family
the
family
that
was
to
have
two
lives
lived
for
its
success
at
the
table
sat
colonel
tom
with
his
broad
white
shirt
front
his
white
pointed
beard
and
his
grandiloquent
flow
of
talk
at
sue
s
side
sat
jack
prince
pausing
in
his
open
admiration
of
sue
to
cast
an
eye
on
the
handsome
new
york
girl
at
sam
s
end
of
the
table
or
to
puncture
with
a
flash
of
his
terse
common
sense
some
balloon
of
theory
launched
by
williams
of
the
university
who
sat
on
the
other
side
of
sue
the
artist
who
hoped
for
a
commission
to
paint
colonel
tom
sat
opposite
him
bewailing
the
dying
out
of
fine
old
american
families
and
a
little
german
scientist
sat
beside
colonel
tom
smiling
as
the
artist
talked
the
man
sam
fancied
was
laughing
at
them
both
perhaps
at
all
of
them
he
did
not
mind
he
looked
at
the
scientist
and
at
the
other
faces
up
and
down
the
table
and
then
at
sue
he
saw
her
directing
and
leading
the
talk
he
saw
the
play
of
muscles
about
her
strong
neck
and
the
fine
firmness
of
her
straight
little
body
and
his
eyes
grew
moist
and
a
lump
came
into
his
throat
at
the
thought
of
the
secret
that
lay
between
them
and
then
his
mind
ran
back
to
another
night
in
caxton
when
first
he
sat
eating
among
strange
people
at
freedom
smith
s
table
he
saw
again
the
tomboy
girl
and
the
sturdy
boy
and
the
lantern
swinging
in
freedom
s
hand
in
the
close
little
stable
he
saw
the
absurd
housepainter
trying
to
blow
the
bugle
in
the
street
and
the
mother
talking
to
her
boy
of
death
through
the
summer
evening
the
fat
foreman
making
the
record
of
his
loves
on
the
walls
of
his
room
the
commission
man
rubbing
his
hands
before
a
group
of
greek
hucksters
and
then
this
this
home
with
its
safety
and
its
secret
high
aim
and
him
sitting
there
at
the
head
of
it
all
like
the
novelist
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
should
admire
and
bow
his
head
before
the
romance
of
destiny
he
thought
his
station
his
wife
his
country
his
end
in
life
when
rightly
seen
the
very
apex
of
life
on
the
earth
and
to
him
in
his
pride
it
seemed
that
he
was
in
some
way
the
master
and
maker
of
it
all
chapter
vii
late
one
evening
some
weeks
after
the
mcphersons
had
given
the
dinner
party
in
secret
celebration
of
the
future
arrival
of
what
was
to
be
the
first
of
the
great
family
they
came
together
down
the
steps
of
a
north
side
house
to
their
waiting
carriage
they
had
spent
sam
thought
a
delightful
evening
the
grovers
were
people
of
whose
friendship
he
was
particularly
proud
and
since
his
marriage
with
sue
he
had
taken
her
often
for
an
evening
to
the
house
of
the
venerable
surgeon
doctor
grover
was
a
scholar
a
man
of
note
in
the
medical
world
and
a
rapid
and
absorbing
talker
and
thinker
on
any
subject
that
aroused
his
interest
a
certain
youthful
enthusiasm
in
his
outlook
on
life
had
attracted
to
him
the
devotion
of
sue
who
since
meeting
him
through
sam
had
counted
him
a
marked
addition
to
their
little
group
of
friends
his
wife
a
plump
little
woman
was
though
apparently
somewhat
diffident
in
reality
his
intellectual
equal
and
companion
and
sue
in
a
quiet
way
had
taken
her
as
a
model
in
her
own
effort
toward
complete
wifehood
during
the
evening
spent
in
a
rapid
exchange
of
opinions
and
ideas
between
the
two
men
sue
had
sat
in
silence
once
when
he
looked
at
her
sam
thought
that
he
had
surprised
an
annoyed
look
in
her
eyes
and
was
puzzled
by
it
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
her
eyes
refused
to
meet
his
and
she
looked
instead
at
the
floor
a
flush
mounting
her
cheeks
at
the
door
of
the
carriage
frank
sue
s
coachman
stepped
on
the
hem
of
her
gown
and
tore
it
the
tear
was
slight
the
incident
sam
thought
entirely
unavoidable
and
as
much
due
to
a
momentary
clumsiness
on
the
part
of
sue
as
to
the
awkwardness
of
frank
the
man
had
for
years
been
a
loyal
servant
and
a
devoted
admirer
of
sue
s
sam
laughed
and
taking
sue
by
the
arm
started
to
help
her
in
at
the
carriage
door
too
much
gown
for
an
athlete
he
said
pointlessly
in
a
flash
sue
turned
and
faced
the
coachman
awkward
brute
she
said
through
her
teeth
sam
stood
on
the
sidewalk
dumb
with
astonishment
as
frank
turned
and
climbed
to
his
seat
without
waiting
to
close
the
carriage
door
he
felt
as
he
might
have
felt
had
he
as
a
boy
heard
profanity
from
the
lips
of
his
mother
the
look
in
sue
s
eyes
as
she
turned
them
on
frank
struck
him
like
a
blow
and
in
a
moment
his
whole
carefully
conception
of
her
and
of
her
character
had
been
shaken
he
had
an
impulse
to
slam
the
carriage
door
after
her
and
walk
home
they
drove
home
in
silence
sam
feeling
as
though
he
rode
beside
a
new
and
strange
being
in
the
light
of
passing
street
lamps
he
could
see
her
face
held
straight
ahead
and
her
eyes
staring
stonily
at
the
curtain
in
front
he
didn
t
want
to
reproach
her
he
wanted
to
take
hold
of
her
arm
and
shake
her
i
should
like
to
take
the
whip
from
in
front
of
frank
s
seat
and
give
her
a
sound
beating
he
told
himself
at
the
house
sue
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
and
running
past
him
in
at
the
door
closed
it
after
her
frank
drove
off
toward
the
stables
and
when
sam
went
into
the
house
he
found
sue
standing
half
way
up
the
stairs
leading
to
her
room
and
waiting
for
him
i
presume
you
do
not
know
that
you
have
been
openly
insulting
me
all
evening
she
cried
your
beastly
talk
there
at
the
grovers
it
was
unbearable
who
are
these
women
why
parade
your
past
life
before
me
sam
said
nothing
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
looked
up
at
her
and
then
turning
just
as
she
running
up
the
stairs
slammed
the
door
of
her
own
room
he
went
into
the
library
a
wood
fire
burned
in
the
grate
and
he
sat
down
and
lighted
his
pipe
he
did
not
try
to
think
the
thing
out
he
felt
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
a
lie
and
that
the
sue
who
had
lived
in
his
mind
and
in
his
affections
no
longer
existed
that
in
her
place
there
was
this
other
woman
this
woman
who
had
insulted
her
own
servant
and
had
perverted
and
distorted
the
meaning
of
his
talk
during
the
evening
sitting
by
the
fire
filling
and
refilling
his
pipe
sam
went
carefully
over
every
word
gesture
and
incident
of
the
evening
at
the
grovers
and
could
get
hold
of
no
part
of
it
that
he
thought
might
in
fairness
serve
as
an
excuse
for
the
outburst
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
he
could
hear
sue
moving
restlessly
about
and
he
had
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
her
mind
was
punishing
her
for
so
strange
a
seizure
he
and
grover
had
perhaps
been
somewhat
carried
away
he
told
himself
they
had
talked
of
marriage
and
its
meaning
and
had
both
declared
somewhat
hotly
against
the
idea
that
the
loss
of
virginity
in
women
was
in
any
sense
a
bar
to
honourable
marriage
but
he
had
said
nothing
that
he
thought
could
have
been
twisted
into
an
insult
to
sue
or
to
grover
he
had
thought
the
talk
rather
good
and
clearly
thought
out
and
had
come
out
of
the
house
exhilarated
and
secretly
preening
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
had
talked
unusually
forcefully
and
well
in
any
event
what
had
been
said
had
been
said
before
in
sue
s
presence
and
he
thought
that
he
could
remember
her
having
in
the
past
expressed
similar
ideas
with
enthusiasm
hour
after
hour
he
sat
in
the
chair
before
the
dying
fire
he
dozed
and
his
pipe
dropped
from
his
hand
and
fell
upon
the
stone
hearth
a
kind
of
dumb
misery
and
anger
was
in
him
as
over
and
over
endlessly
his
mind
kept
reviewing
the
events
of
the
evening
what
has
made
her
think
she
can
do
that
to
me
he
kept
asking
himself
he
remembered
certain
strange
silences
and
hard
looks
from
her
eyes
during
the
past
weeks
silences
and
looks
that
in
the
light
of
the
events
of
the
evening
became
pregnant
with
meaning
she
has
a
temper
a
beast
of
a
temper
why
shouldn
t
she
have
been
square
and
told
me
he
asked
himself
the
clock
had
struck
three
when
the
library
door
opened
quietly
and
sue
clad
in
a
dressing
gown
through
which
the
new
roundness
of
her
lithe
little
figure
was
plainly
apparent
came
into
the
room
she
ran
across
to
him
and
putting
her
head
down
on
his
knee
wept
bitterly
oh
sam
she
said
i
think
i
am
going
insane
i
have
been
hating
you
as
i
have
not
hated
since
i
was
an
child
a
thing
i
worked
years
to
suppress
in
me
has
come
back
i
have
been
hating
myself
and
the
baby
for
days
i
have
been
fighting
the
feeling
in
me
and
now
it
has
come
out
and
perhaps
you
have
begun
hating
me
can
you
love
me
again
will
you
ever
forget
the
meanness
and
the
cheapness
of
it
you
and
poor
innocent
frank
oh
sam
the
devil
was
in
me
reaching
down
sam
took
her
into
his
arms
and
cuddled
her
like
a
child
a
story
he
had
heard
of
the
vagaries
of
women
at
such
times
came
back
to
him
and
was
as
a
light
illuminating
the
darkness
of
his
mind
i
understand
now
he
said
it
is
a
part
of
the
burden
you
carry
for
us
for
some
weeks
after
the
outbreak
at
the
carriage
door
events
ran
smoothly
in
the
mcpherson
house
one
day
as
he
stood
in
the
stable
door
frank
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
and
looking
up
sheepishly
from
under
his
cap
said
to
sam
i
understand
about
the
missus
it
is
the
baby
coming
we
have
had
four
of
them
at
our
house
and
sam
nodding
his
head
turned
and
began
talking
rapidly
of
his
plans
to
replace
the
carriages
with
automobiles
but
in
the
house
in
spite
of
the
clearing
up
of
the
matter
of
sue
s
ugliness
at
the
grovers
a
subtle
change
had
taken
place
in
the
relationship
of
the
two
although
they
were
together
facing
the
first
of
the
events
that
were
to
be
like
in
the
great
voyage
of
their
lives
they
were
not
facing
it
with
the
same
mutual
understanding
and
kindly
tolerance
with
which
they
had
faced
smaller
things
in
the
past
a
disagreement
over
the
method
of
shooting
a
rapid
in
a
river
or
the
entertainment
of
an
undesirable
guest
the
inclination
to
fits
of
temper
loosens
and
disarranges
all
the
little
wires
of
life
the
tune
will
not
get
itself
played
one
stands
waiting
for
the
discord
strained
missing
the
harmony
it
was
so
with
sam
he
began
feeling
that
he
must
keep
a
check
upon
his
tongue
and
that
things
of
which
they
had
talked
with
great
freedom
six
months
earlier
now
annoyed
and
irritated
his
wife
when
brought
into
an
discussion
to
sam
who
during
his
life
with
sue
had
learned
the
joy
of
free
open
talk
upon
any
subject
that
came
into
his
mind
and
whose
native
interest
in
life
and
in
the
motives
of
men
and
women
had
blossomed
in
the
large
leisure
and
independence
of
the
last
year
this
was
trying
it
was
he
thought
like
trying
to
hold
free
and
open
communion
with
the
people
of
an
orthodox
family
and
he
fell
into
a
habit
of
prolonged
silences
a
habit
that
later
he
found
once
formed
unbelievably
hard
to
break
one
day
in
the
office
a
situation
arose
that
seemed
to
demand
sam
s
presence
in
boston
on
a
certain
date
for
months
he
had
been
carrying
on
a
trade
war
with
some
of
the
eastern
manufacturers
in
his
line
and
an
opportunity
for
the
settlement
of
the
trouble
in
a
way
advantageous
to
himself
had
he
thought
arisen
he
wanted
to
handle
the
matter
himself
and
went
home
to
explain
to
sue
it
was
at
the
end
of
a
day
when
nothing
had
occurred
to
irritate
her
and
she
agreed
with
him
that
he
should
not
be
compelled
to
trust
so
important
a
matter
to
another
i
am
no
child
sam
i
will
take
care
of
myself
she
said
laughing
sam
wired
his
new
york
man
asking
him
to
make
the
arrangements
for
the
meeting
in
boston
and
picked
up
a
book
to
spend
the
evening
reading
aloud
to
her
and
then
coming
home
the
next
evening
he
found
her
in
tears
and
when
he
tried
to
laugh
away
her
fears
she
flew
into
a
black
fit
of
anger
and
ran
out
of
the
room
sam
went
to
the
phone
and
called
his
new
york
man
thinking
to
instruct
him
in
regard
to
the
conference
in
boston
and
to
give
up
his
own
plans
for
the
trip
when
he
had
got
his
man
on
the
wire
sue
who
had
been
standing
outside
the
door
rushed
in
and
put
her
hand
over
the
mouthpiece
of
the
phone
sam
sam
she
cried
do
not
give
up
the
trip
scold
me
beat
me
do
anything
but
do
not
let
me
go
on
making
a
fool
of
myself
and
destroying
your
peace
of
mind
i
shall
be
miserable
if
you
stay
at
home
because
of
what
i
have
said
over
the
phone
came
the
insistent
voice
of
central
and
putting
her
hand
aside
sam
talked
to
his
man
letting
the
engagement
stand
and
making
some
detail
of
the
conference
answer
as
his
need
of
calling
again
sue
was
repentant
and
again
after
her
tears
they
sat
before
the
fire
until
his
train
time
talking
like
lovers
to
buffalo
in
the
morning
came
a
wire
from
her
come
back
let
business
go
can
not
stand
it
she
had
wired
while
he
sat
reading
the
wire
the
porter
brought
another
please
sam
pay
no
attention
to
any
wire
from
me
i
am
all
right
and
only
half
a
sam
was
irritated
it
is
deliberate
pettiness
and
weakness
he
thought
when
an
hour
later
the
porter
brought
another
wire
demanding
his
immediate
return
the
situation
calls
for
drastic
action
and
perhaps
one
good
stinging
reproof
will
stop
it
for
all
going
into
the
buffet
car
he
wrote
a
long
letter
calling
her
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
certain
amount
of
freedom
of
action
was
due
him
and
saying
that
he
intended
to
act
upon
his
own
judgment
in
the
future
and
not
upon
her
impulses
having
begun
to
write
sam
went
on
and
on
he
was
not
interrupted
no
shadow
crossed
the
face
of
his
beloved
to
tell
him
he
was
hurting
and
he
said
all
that
was
in
his
mind
to
say
little
sharp
reproofs
that
had
come
into
his
mind
but
that
had
been
left
unsaid
now
got
themselves
said
and
when
he
had
dumped
his
overloaded
mind
into
the
letter
he
sealed
and
mailed
it
at
a
passing
station
within
an
hour
after
the
letter
had
left
his
hands
sam
regretted
it
he
thought
of
the
little
woman
bearing
the
burden
for
them
both
and
things
grover
had
told
him
of
the
unhappiness
of
women
in
her
condition
came
back
to
haunt
his
mind
so
that
he
wrote
and
sent
off
to
her
a
wire
asking
her
not
to
read
the
letter
he
had
mailed
and
assuring
her
that
he
would
hurry
through
the
boston
conference
and
get
back
to
her
at
once
when
sam
returned
he
knew
that
in
an
evil
moment
sue
had
opened
and
read
the
letter
sent
from
the
train
and
was
surprised
and
hurt
by
the
knowledge
the
act
seemed
like
a
betrayal
he
said
nothing
going
about
his
work
with
a
troubled
mind
and
watching
with
growing
anxiety
her
alternate
fits
of
white
anger
and
fearful
remorse
he
thought
her
growing
worse
daily
and
became
alarmed
for
her
health
and
then
after
a
talk
with
grover
he
began
to
spend
more
and
more
time
with
her
forcing
her
to
take
with
him
daily
long
walks
in
the
open
air
he
tried
valiantly
to
keep
her
mind
fixed
on
cheerful
things
and
went
to
bed
happy
and
relieved
when
a
day
ended
that
did
not
bring
a
stormy
passage
between
them
there
were
days
during
that
period
when
sam
thought
himself
near
insanity
with
a
light
in
her
grey
eyes
that
was
maddening
sue
would
take
up
some
minor
thing
a
remark
he
had
made
or
a
passage
he
had
quoted
from
some
book
and
in
a
dead
level
complaining
tone
would
talk
of
it
until
his
head
reeled
and
his
fingers
ached
from
the
gripping
of
his
hands
to
keep
control
of
himself
after
such
a
day
he
would
steal
off
by
himself
and
walking
rapidly
would
try
through
pure
physical
fatigue
to
force
his
mind
to
give
up
the
remembrance
of
the
persistent
complaining
voice
at
times
he
would
give
way
to
fits
of
anger
and
strew
impotent
oaths
along
the
silent
street
or
in
another
mood
would
mumble
and
talk
to
himself
praying
for
strength
and
courage
to
keep
his
own
head
during
the
ordeal
through
which
he
thought
they
were
passing
together
and
when
he
returned
from
such
a
walk
and
from
such
a
struggle
with
himself
it
often
occurred
that
he
would
find
her
waiting
in
the
arm
chair
before
the
fire
in
her
room
her
mind
clear
and
her
little
face
wet
with
the
tears
of
her
repentance
and
then
the
struggle
ended
with
doctor
grover
it
had
been
arranged
that
sue
should
be
taken
to
the
hospital
for
the
great
event
and
they
drove
there
hurriedly
one
night
through
the
quiet
streets
the
recurring
pains
gripping
sue
and
her
hands
clutching
his
an
exalted
cheerfulness
had
hold
of
them
face
to
face
with
the
actual
struggle
for
the
new
life
sue
was
transfigured
her
voice
rang
with
triumph
and
her
eyes
glistened
i
am
going
to
do
it
she
cried
my
black
fear
is
gone
i
shall
give
you
a
child
a
man
child
i
shall
succeed
my
man
sam
you
shall
see
it
will
be
when
the
pain
gripped
she
gripped
at
his
hand
and
a
spasm
of
physical
sympathy
ran
through
him
he
felt
helpless
and
ashamed
of
his
helplessness
at
the
entrance
to
the
hospital
grounds
she
put
her
face
down
upon
his
knees
so
that
the
hot
tears
ran
through
his
hands
poor
poor
old
sam
it
has
been
horrible
for
at
the
hospital
sam
walked
up
and
down
in
the
corridor
through
the
swinging
doors
at
the
end
of
which
she
had
been
taken
every
vestige
of
regret
for
the
trying
months
now
lying
behind
had
passed
and
he
paced
up
and
down
the
corridor
feeling
that
he
had
come
to
one
of
those
huge
moments
when
a
man
s
brain
his
grasp
of
affairs
his
hopes
and
plans
for
the
future
all
of
the
little
details
and
trivialities
of
his
life
halt
and
he
waits
anxious
breathless
expectant
he
looked
at
a
little
clock
on
a
table
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
half
expecting
it
to
stop
also
and
wait
with
him
his
marriage
hour
that
had
seemed
so
big
and
vital
seemed
now
in
the
quiet
corridor
with
the
stone
floor
and
the
silent
nurses
passing
up
and
down
and
in
the
presence
of
this
greater
event
to
have
shrunk
enormously
he
walked
up
and
down
peering
at
the
clock
looking
at
the
swinging
door
and
biting
at
the
stem
of
his
empty
pipe
and
then
through
the
swinging
door
came
grover
we
can
get
the
child
sam
but
to
get
it
we
shall
have
to
take
a
chance
with
her
do
you
want
to
do
that
do
not
wait
sam
sprang
past
him
toward
the
door
you
bungler
he
cried
and
his
voice
rang
through
the
long
quiet
corridor
you
do
not
know
what
this
means
let
me
doctor
grover
catching
him
by
the
arm
swung
him
about
the
two
men
stood
facing
each
other
you
stay
here
said
the
doctor
his
voice
remaining
quiet
and
firm
i
will
attend
to
things
your
going
in
there
would
be
pure
folly
now
now
answer
me
do
you
want
to
take
the
chance
no
no
sam
shouted
no
i
want
her
sue
alive
and
well
back
through
that
a
cold
gleam
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
shook
his
fist
before
the
doctor
s
face
do
not
try
deceiving
me
about
this
by
god
i
will
turning
doctor
grover
ran
back
through
the
swinging
door
leaving
sam
staring
blankly
at
his
back
a
nurse
one
whom
he
had
seen
in
doctor
grover
s
office
came
out
of
the
door
and
taking
his
arm
walked
beside
him
up
and
down
the
corridor
sam
put
his
arm
around
her
shoulder
and
talked
an
illusion
that
it
was
necessary
to
comfort
her
came
to
him
do
not
worry
he
said
she
will
be
all
right
grover
will
take
care
of
her
nothing
can
happen
to
little
the
nurse
a
small
scotch
woman
who
knew
and
admired
sue
wept
some
quality
in
his
voice
had
touched
the
woman
in
her
and
the
tears
ran
in
a
little
stream
down
her
cheeks
sam
continued
talking
the
woman
s
tears
helping
him
to
regain
his
grip
upon
himself
my
mother
is
dead
he
said
an
old
sorrow
revisiting
him
i
wish
that
you
like
mary
underwood
would
be
a
new
mother
to
when
the
time
came
that
he
could
be
taken
to
the
room
where
sue
lay
his
had
returned
to
him
and
his
mind
had
begun
blaming
the
little
dead
stranger
for
the
unhappiness
of
the
past
months
and
for
the
long
separation
from
what
he
thought
was
the
real
sue
outside
the
door
of
the
room
into
which
she
had
been
taken
he
stopped
hearing
her
voice
thin
and
weak
talking
to
grover
unfit
sue
mcpherson
unfit
said
the
voice
and
sam
thought
it
was
filled
with
an
infinite
weariness
he
ran
through
the
door
and
dropped
on
his
knees
by
her
bed
she
turned
her
eyes
to
him
smiling
bravely
the
next
time
we
ll
make
it
she
said
the
second
child
born
to
the
young
mcphersons
arrived
out
of
time
again
sam
walked
this
time
through
the
corridor
of
his
own
house
and
without
the
consoling
presence
of
the
scotch
woman
and
again
he
shook
his
head
at
doctor
grover
who
came
to
him
consoling
and
reassuring
after
the
death
of
the
second
child
sue
lay
for
months
in
bed
in
his
arms
in
her
own
room
she
wept
openly
in
the
presence
of
grover
and
the
nurses
crying
out
against
her
unfitness
for
several
days
she
refused
to
see
colonel
tom
harbouring
in
her
mind
the
notion
that
he
was
in
some
way
responsible
for
her
physical
inability
to
bear
living
children
and
when
she
got
up
from
her
bed
she
remained
for
months
white
and
listless
but
grimly
determined
upon
another
attempt
for
the
little
life
she
so
wanted
to
feel
in
her
arms
during
the
days
of
her
carrying
the
second
baby
she
had
again
the
fierce
ugly
attacks
of
temper
that
had
shattered
sam
s
nerves
but
having
learned
to
understand
he
went
quietly
about
his
work
trying
as
far
as
in
him
lay
to
close
his
ears
to
the
stinging
hurtful
things
she
sometimes
said
and
the
third
time
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
if
they
were
again
unsuccessful
they
would
turn
their
minds
to
other
things
if
we
do
not
succeed
this
time
we
might
as
well
count
ourselves
through
with
each
other
for
good
she
said
one
day
in
one
of
the
fits
of
cold
anger
that
were
a
part
of
child
bearing
with
her
that
second
night
when
sam
walked
in
the
hospital
corridor
he
was
beside
himself
he
felt
like
a
young
recruit
called
to
face
an
unseen
enemy
and
to
stand
motionless
and
inactive
in
the
presence
of
the
singing
death
that
ran
through
the
air
he
remembered
a
story
told
when
he
was
a
child
by
a
fellow
soldier
who
had
come
to
visit
his
father
of
the
prisoners
at
andersonville
creeping
in
the
darkness
past
armed
sentries
to
a
little
pool
of
stagnant
water
beyond
the
dead
line
and
felt
that
he
too
was
creeping
unarmed
and
helpless
in
the
neighbourhood
of
death
in
a
conference
at
his
house
between
the
three
some
weeks
before
it
had
been
decided
after
tearful
insistence
on
the
part
of
sue
and
a
stand
on
the
part
of
grover
who
declared
that
he
would
not
remain
on
the
case
unless
permitted
to
use
his
own
judgment
that
an
operation
should
be
performed
take
the
chances
that
need
be
taken
sam
had
said
to
grover
after
the
conference
she
will
never
stand
another
defeat
give
her
the
in
the
corridor
it
seemed
to
sam
that
hours
had
passed
and
still
he
stood
motionless
waiting
his
feet
felt
cold
and
he
had
the
impression
that
they
were
wet
although
the
night
was
dry
and
a
moon
shone
outside
when
from
a
distant
part
of
the
hospital
a
groan
reached
his
ears
he
shook
with
fright
and
had
an
inclination
to
cry
out
two
young
interns
clad
in
white
passed
old
grover
is
doing
a
caesarian
section
said
one
of
them
he
is
getting
out
of
date
hope
he
doesn
t
bungle
in
sam
s
ears
rang
the
remembrance
of
sue
s
voice
the
sue
who
that
first
time
had
gone
into
the
room
behind
the
swinging
doors
with
the
determined
smile
on
her
face
he
thought
he
could
see
again
the
white
face
looking
up
from
the
wheeled
cot
on
which
they
had
taken
her
through
the
door
i
am
afraid
grover
i
am
afraid
i
am
unfit
he
had
heard
her
say
as
the
door
closed
and
then
sam
did
a
thing
for
which
he
cursed
himself
the
rest
of
his
life
on
an
impulse
and
maddened
by
the
intolerable
waiting
he
walked
to
the
swinging
doors
and
pushing
them
open
stepped
into
the
operating
room
where
grover
was
at
work
upon
sue
the
room
was
long
and
narrow
with
floors
walls
and
ceiling
of
white
cement
a
great
glaring
light
suspended
from
the
ceiling
threw
its
rays
directly
down
on
a
figure
lying
on
a
white
metal
operating
table
on
the
walls
of
the
room
were
other
glaring
lights
set
in
shining
glass
reflectors
and
here
and
there
through
an
intense
expectant
atmosphere
moved
and
stood
silently
a
group
of
men
and
women
faceless
hairless
with
only
their
strangely
vivid
eyes
showing
through
the
white
masks
that
covered
their
faces
sam
standing
motionless
by
the
door
looked
about
with
wild
eyes
grover
worked
rapidly
and
silently
taking
from
time
to
time
little
shining
instruments
from
a
swinging
table
close
at
his
hand
the
nurse
standing
beside
him
looked
up
toward
the
light
and
began
calmly
threading
a
needle
and
in
a
white
basin
on
a
little
stand
at
the
side
of
the
room
lay
the
last
of
sue
s
tremendous
efforts
toward
new
life
the
last
of
their
dreams
of
the
great
family
sam
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
his
head
striking
against
the
wall
aroused
him
and
he
struggled
to
his
feet
without
stopping
his
work
grover
began
swearing
damn
it
man
get
out
of
sam
groped
with
his
hand
for
the
door
one
of
the
ghoulish
figures
started
toward
him
and
then
with
his
head
reeling
and
his
eyes
closed
he
backed
through
the
door
and
running
along
the
corridor
and
down
a
flight
of
broad
stairs
reached
the
open
air
and
darkness
he
had
no
doubt
of
sue
s
death
she
is
gone
he
muttered
hurrying
bareheaded
along
the
deserted
streets
through
street
after
street
he
ran
twice
he
came
out
upon
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
then
turning
went
back
into
the
heart
of
the
city
through
streets
bathed
in
the
warm
moonlight
once
he
turned
quickly
at
a
corner
and
stepping
into
a
vacant
lot
stood
behind
a
high
board
fence
as
a
policeman
strolled
along
the
street
into
his
head
came
the
idea
that
he
had
killed
sue
and
that
the
figure
walking
with
heavy
tread
on
the
stone
pavement
was
seeking
him
to
take
him
back
to
where
she
lay
white
and
lifeless
again
he
stopped
before
a
little
frame
drugstore
on
a
corner
and
sitting
down
on
the
steps
before
it
cursed
god
openly
and
defiantly
like
an
angry
boy
defying
his
father
some
instinct
led
him
to
look
at
the
sky
through
the
tangle
of
telegraph
wires
overhead
go
on
and
do
what
you
dare
he
cried
i
will
not
follow
you
now
i
shall
never
try
to
find
you
after
presently
he
began
laughing
at
himself
for
the
instinct
that
had
led
him
to
look
at
the
sky
and
to
shout
out
his
defiance
and
getting
up
wandered
on
in
his
wanderings
he
came
to
a
railroad
track
where
a
freight
train
groaned
and
rattled
over
a
crossing
when
he
came
up
to
it
he
jumped
upon
an
empty
coal
car
falling
as
he
climbed
and
cutting
his
face
upon
the
sharp
pieces
of
coal
that
lay
scattered
about
the
bottom
of
the
car
the
train
ground
along
slowly
stopping
occasionally
the
engine
shrieking
hysterically
after
a
time
he
got
out
of
the
car
and
dropped
to
the
ground
on
all
sides
of
him
were
marshes
the
long
rank
marsh
grasses
rolling
and
tossing
in
the
moonlight
when
the
train
had
passed
he
followed
it
walking
stumblingly
along
as
he
walked
following
the
blinking
lights
at
the
end
of
the
train
he
thought
of
the
scene
in
the
hospital
and
of
sue
lying
dead
for
that
that
ping
livid
and
shapeless
on
the
table
under
the
lights
where
the
solid
ground
ran
up
to
the
tracks
sam
sat
down
under
a
tree
peace
came
over
him
this
is
the
end
of
things
he
thought
and
was
like
a
tired
child
comforted
by
its
mother
he
thought
of
the
nurse
who
had
walked
with
him
that
other
time
in
the
corridor
of
the
hospital
and
who
had
wept
because
of
his
fears
and
then
of
the
night
when
he
had
felt
the
throat
of
his
father
between
his
fingers
in
the
squalid
little
kitchen
he
ran
his
hands
along
the
ground
good
old
ground
he
said
a
sentence
came
into
his
mind
followed
by
the
figure
of
john
telfer
striding
stick
in
hand
along
a
dusty
road
here
is
spring
come
and
time
to
plant
out
flowers
in
the
grass
he
said
aloud
his
face
felt
swollen
and
sore
from
the
fall
in
the
freight
car
and
he
lay
down
on
the
ground
under
a
tree
and
slept
when
he
woke
it
was
morning
and
grey
clouds
were
drifting
across
the
sky
within
sight
down
a
road
a
trolley
car
went
past
into
the
city
before
him
in
the
midst
of
the
marsh
lay
a
low
lake
and
a
raised
walk
with
boats
tied
to
the
posts
on
which
it
stood
ran
down
to
the
water
he
went
down
the
walk
bathed
his
bruised
face
in
the
water
and
boarding
a
car
went
back
into
the
city
in
the
morning
air
a
new
thought
took
possession
of
him
the
wind
ran
along
a
dusty
road
beside
the
car
track
picking
up
little
handfuls
of
dust
and
playfully
throwing
them
about
he
had
a
strained
eager
feeling
like
some
one
listening
for
a
faint
call
out
of
the
distance
to
be
sure
he
thought
i
know
what
it
is
it
is
my
wedding
day
i
am
to
marry
sue
rainey
at
the
house
he
found
grover
and
colonel
tom
standing
in
the
breakfast
room
grover
looked
at
his
swollen
distorted
face
his
voice
trembled
poor
devil
he
said
you
have
had
a
night
sam
laughed
and
slapped
colonel
tom
on
the
shoulder
we
will
have
to
begin
getting
ready
he
said
the
wedding
is
at
ten
sue
will
be
getting
grover
and
colonel
tom
took
him
by
the
arm
and
began
leading
him
up
the
stairs
colonel
tom
weeping
like
a
woman
silly
old
fool
thought
sam
when
two
weeks
later
he
again
opened
his
eyes
to
consciousness
sue
sat
beside
his
bed
in
a
reclining
chair
her
little
thin
white
hand
in
his
get
the
baby
he
cried
believing
anything
possible
i
want
to
see
the
baby
she
laid
her
head
down
on
the
pillow
it
was
gone
when
you
saw
it
she
said
and
put
an
arm
about
his
neck
when
the
nurse
came
back
she
found
them
their
heads
together
upon
the
pillow
crying
weakly
like
two
tired
children

the
blow
given
the
plan
of
life
so
carefully
thought
out
and
so
eagerly
accepted
by
the
young
mcphersons
threw
them
back
upon
themselves
for
several
years
they
had
been
living
upon
a
hill
top
taking
themselves
very
seriously
and
more
than
a
little
preening
themselves
with
the
thought
that
they
were
two
very
unusual
and
thoughtful
people
engaged
upon
a
worthy
and
ennobling
enterprise
sitting
in
their
corner
immersed
in
admiration
of
their
own
purposes
and
in
the
thoughts
of
the
vigorous
disciplined
new
life
they
were
to
give
the
world
by
the
combined
efficiency
of
their
two
bodies
and
minds
they
were
at
a
word
and
a
shake
of
the
head
from
doctor
grover
compelled
to
remake
the
outline
of
their
future
together
all
about
them
the
rush
of
life
went
on
vast
changes
were
impending
in
the
industrial
life
of
the
people
cities
were
doubling
and
tripling
their
population
a
war
was
being
fought
and
the
flag
of
their
country
flew
in
the
ports
of
strange
seas
while
american
boys
pushed
their
way
through
the
tangled
jungles
of
strange
lands
carrying
in
their
hands
rifles
and
in
a
huge
stone
house
set
in
a
broad
expanse
of
green
lawns
near
the
shores
of
lake
michigan
sam
mcpherson
sat
looking
at
his
wife
who
in
turn
looked
at
him
he
was
trying
as
she
also
was
trying
to
adjust
himself
to
the
cheerful
acceptance
of
their
new
prospect
of
a
childless
life
looking
at
sue
across
the
dinner
table
or
seeing
her
straight
wiry
body
astride
a
horse
riding
beside
him
through
the
parks
it
seemed
to
sam
unbelievable
that
a
childless
womanhood
was
ever
to
be
her
portion
and
more
than
once
he
had
an
inclination
to
venture
again
upon
an
effort
for
the
success
of
their
hopes
but
when
he
remembered
her
still
white
face
that
night
in
the
hospital
her
bitter
haunting
cry
of
defeat
he
turned
with
a
shudder
from
the
thought
feeling
that
he
could
not
go
with
her
again
through
that
ordeal
that
he
could
not
again
allow
her
to
look
forward
through
weeks
and
months
toward
the
little
life
that
never
came
to
lie
upon
her
breast
or
to
laugh
up
into
her
face
and
yet
sam
son
of
that
jane
mcpherson
who
had
won
the
admiration
of
the
men
of
caxton
by
her
ceaseless
efforts
to
keep
her
family
afloat
and
clean
handed
could
not
sit
idly
by
living
upon
the
income
of
his
own
and
sue
s
money
the
stirring
world
called
to
him
he
looked
about
him
at
the
broad
significant
movements
in
business
and
finance
at
the
new
men
coming
into
prominence
and
apparently
finding
a
way
for
the
expression
of
new
big
ideas
and
felt
his
youth
stirring
in
him
and
his
mind
reaching
out
to
new
projects
and
new
ambitions
given
the
necessity
for
economy
and
a
hard
struggle
for
a
livelihood
and
competence
sam
could
conceive
of
living
his
life
with
sue
and
deriving
something
like
gratification
from
just
her
companionship
and
her
partnership
in
his
efforts
here
and
there
during
the
waiting
years
he
had
met
men
who
had
found
such
gratification
a
foreman
in
the
shops
or
a
tobacconist
from
whom
he
bought
his
cigars
but
for
himself
he
felt
that
he
had
gone
with
sue
too
far
upon
another
road
to
turn
that
way
now
with
anything
like
mutual
zeal
or
interest
at
bottom
his
mind
did
not
run
strongly
toward
the
idea
of
the
love
of
women
as
an
end
in
life
he
had
loved
and
did
love
sue
with
something
approaching
religious
fervour
but
the
fervour
was
more
than
half
due
to
the
ideas
she
had
given
him
and
to
the
fact
that
with
him
she
was
to
have
been
the
instrument
for
the
realisation
of
those
ideas
he
was
a
man
with
children
in
his
loins
and
he
had
given
up
his
struggles
for
business
eminence
for
the
sake
of
preparing
himself
for
a
kind
of
noble
fatherhood
of
children
many
children
strong
children
fit
gifts
to
the
world
for
two
exceptionally
favoured
lives
in
all
of
his
talks
with
sue
this
idea
had
been
present
and
dominant
he
had
looked
about
him
and
in
the
arrogance
of
his
youth
and
in
the
pride
of
his
good
body
and
mind
had
condemned
all
childless
marriages
as
a
selfish
waste
of
good
lives
with
her
he
had
agreed
that
such
lives
were
without
point
and
purpose
now
he
remembered
that
in
the
days
of
her
audacity
and
daring
she
had
more
than
once
expressed
the
hope
that
in
case
of
a
childless
issue
to
their
marriage
one
or
the
other
of
them
would
have
the
courage
to
cut
the
knot
that
tied
them
and
venture
into
another
effort
at
right
living
at
any
cost
in
the
months
after
sue
s
last
recovery
and
during
the
long
evenings
as
they
sat
together
or
walked
under
the
stars
in
the
park
the
thought
of
these
talks
was
often
in
sam
s
mind
and
he
found
himself
beginning
to
speculate
on
her
present
attitude
and
to
wonder
how
bravely
she
would
meet
the
idea
of
a
separation
in
the
end
he
decided
that
no
such
thought
was
in
her
mind
that
face
to
face
with
the
tremendous
actuality
she
clung
to
him
with
a
new
dependence
and
a
new
need
of
his
companionship
the
conviction
of
the
absolute
necessity
of
children
as
a
justification
for
a
man
and
woman
living
together
had
he
thought
burned
itself
more
deeply
into
his
brain
than
into
hers
to
him
it
clung
coming
back
again
and
again
to
his
mind
causing
him
to
turn
here
and
there
restlessly
making
readjustments
seeking
new
light
the
old
gods
being
dead
he
sought
new
gods
in
the
meantime
he
sat
in
his
house
facing
his
wife
losing
himself
in
the
books
recommended
to
him
years
before
by
janet
thinking
his
own
thoughts
often
in
the
evening
he
would
look
up
from
his
book
or
from
his
preoccupied
staring
at
the
fire
to
find
her
eyes
looking
at
him
talk
sam
talk
she
would
say
do
not
sit
there
or
at
another
time
she
would
come
to
his
room
at
night
and
putting
her
head
down
on
the
pillow
beside
his
would
spend
hours
planning
weeping
begging
him
to
give
her
again
his
love
his
old
fervent
devoted
love
this
sam
tried
earnestly
and
honestly
to
do
going
with
her
for
long
walks
when
the
new
call
the
business
had
begun
to
make
to
him
would
have
kept
him
at
his
desk
reading
aloud
to
her
in
the
evening
urging
her
to
shake
off
her
old
dreams
and
to
busy
herself
with
new
work
and
new
interests
through
the
days
in
the
office
he
went
in
a
kind
of
half
stupor
an
old
feeling
of
his
boyhood
coming
back
to
him
it
seemed
to
him
as
it
had
seemed
when
he
walked
aimlessly
through
the
streets
of
caxton
after
the
death
of
his
mother
that
there
remained
something
to
be
done
an
accounting
to
be
made
even
at
his
desk
with
the
clatter
of
typewriters
in
his
ears
and
the
piles
of
letters
demanding
his
attention
his
mind
slipped
back
to
the
days
of
his
courtship
with
sue
and
to
those
days
in
the
north
woods
when
life
had
beat
strong
within
him
and
every
young
wild
thing
every
new
growth
renewed
the
dream
that
filled
his
being
sometimes
on
the
street
or
walking
in
the
park
with
sue
the
cries
of
children
at
play
cut
across
the
sombre
dulness
of
his
mind
and
he
shrank
from
the
sound
and
a
kind
of
bitter
resentment
took
possession
of
him
when
he
looked
covertly
at
sue
she
talked
of
other
things
apparently
unconscious
of
his
thoughts
then
a
new
phase
of
life
presented
itself
to
his
surprise
he
found
himself
looking
with
more
than
passing
interest
at
women
in
the
streets
and
an
old
hunger
for
the
companionship
of
strange
women
came
back
to
him
in
some
way
coarsened
and
materialised
one
evening
at
the
theatre
a
woman
a
friend
of
sue
s
and
the
childless
wife
of
a
business
friend
of
his
own
sat
beside
him
in
the
darkness
of
the
playhouse
her
shoulder
nestled
down
against
his
in
the
excitement
of
a
crisis
on
the
stage
her
hand
slipped
into
his
and
her
fingers
clutched
and
held
his
fingers
animal
desire
seized
and
shook
him
a
feeling
without
sweetness
brutal
making
his
eyes
burn
when
between
the
acts
the
theatre
was
again
flooded
with
light
he
looked
up
guiltily
to
meet
another
pair
of
eyes
equally
filled
with
guilty
hunger
a
challenge
had
been
given
and
received
in
their
car
homeward
bound
sam
put
the
thoughts
of
the
woman
away
from
him
and
taking
sue
in
his
arms
prayed
silently
for
some
help
against
he
knew
not
what
i
think
i
will
go
to
caxton
in
the
morning
and
have
a
talk
with
mary
underwood
he
said
after
his
return
from
caxton
sam
set
about
finding
some
new
interest
to
occupy
sue
s
mind
he
had
spent
an
afternoon
talking
to
valmore
freedom
smith
and
telfer
and
thought
there
was
a
kind
of
flatness
in
their
jokes
and
in
their
ageing
comments
on
each
other
then
he
had
gone
from
them
for
his
talk
with
mary
half
through
the
night
they
had
talked
sam
getting
forgiveness
for
not
writing
and
getting
also
a
long
friendly
lecture
on
his
duty
toward
sue
he
thought
she
had
in
some
way
missed
the
point
she
had
seemed
to
suppose
that
the
loss
of
the
children
had
fallen
singly
upon
sue
she
had
not
counted
upon
him
and
he
had
depended
upon
her
doing
just
that
he
had
come
as
a
boy
to
his
mother
wanting
to
talk
of
himself
and
she
had
wept
at
the
thought
of
the
childless
wife
and
had
told
him
how
to
set
about
making
her
happy
well
i
will
set
about
it
he
thought
on
the
train
coming
home
i
will
find
for
her
this
new
interest
and
make
her
less
dependent
upon
me
then
i
also
will
take
hold
anew
and
work
out
for
myself
a
programme
for
a
way
of
one
afternoon
when
he
came
home
from
the
office
he
found
sue
filled
indeed
with
a
new
idea
with
glowing
cheeks
she
sat
beside
him
through
the
evening
and
talked
of
the
beauties
of
a
life
devoted
to
social
service
i
have
been
thinking
things
out
she
said
her
eyes
shining
we
must
not
allow
ourselves
to
become
sordid
we
must
keep
to
the
vision
we
must
together
give
the
best
in
our
lives
and
our
fortunes
to
mankind
we
must
make
ourselves
units
in
the
great
modern
movements
for
social
sam
looked
at
the
fire
and
a
chill
feeling
of
doubt
ran
through
him
he
could
not
see
himself
as
a
unit
in
anything
his
mind
did
not
run
out
toward
the
thought
of
being
one
of
the
army
of
philanthropists
or
rich
social
uplifters
he
had
met
talking
and
explaining
in
the
reading
rooms
of
clubs
no
answering
flame
burned
in
his
heart
as
it
had
burned
that
evening
by
the
bridle
path
in
jackson
park
when
she
had
expounded
another
idea
but
the
thought
of
a
need
of
new
interest
for
her
coming
to
him
he
turned
to
her
smiling
it
sounds
all
right
but
i
know
nothing
of
such
things
he
said
after
that
evening
sue
began
to
get
a
hold
upon
herself
the
old
fire
came
back
into
her
eyes
and
she
went
about
the
house
with
a
smile
upon
her
face
and
talked
through
the
evenings
to
her
silent
attentive
husband
of
the
life
of
usefulness
the
full
life
one
day
she
told
him
of
her
election
to
the
presidency
of
a
society
for
the
rescue
of
fallen
women
and
he
began
seeing
her
name
in
the
newspapers
in
connection
with
various
charity
and
civic
movements
at
the
house
a
new
sort
of
men
and
women
began
appearing
at
the
dinner
table
a
strangely
earnest
feverish
half
fanatical
people
sam
thought
with
an
inclination
toward
corsetless
dresses
and
uncut
hair
who
talked
far
into
the
night
and
worked
themselves
into
a
sort
of
religious
zeal
over
what
they
called
their
movement
sam
found
them
likely
to
run
to
startling
statements
noticed
that
they
sat
on
the
edges
of
their
chairs
when
they
talked
and
was
puzzled
by
their
tendency
toward
making
the
most
revolutionary
statements
without
pausing
to
back
them
up
when
he
questioned
a
statement
made
by
one
of
these
people
he
came
down
upon
him
with
a
rush
that
quite
carried
him
away
and
then
turning
to
the
others
looked
at
them
wisely
like
a
cat
that
has
swallowed
a
mouse
ask
us
another
question
if
you
dare
their
faces
seemed
to
be
saying
while
their
tongues
declared
that
they
were
but
students
of
the
great
problem
of
right
living
with
these
new
people
sam
never
made
any
progress
toward
real
understanding
and
friendship
for
a
time
he
tried
honestly
to
get
some
of
their
own
fervent
devotions
to
their
ideas
and
to
be
impressed
by
what
they
said
of
their
love
of
man
even
going
with
them
to
some
of
their
meetings
at
one
of
which
he
sat
among
the
fallen
women
gathered
in
and
listened
to
a
speech
by
sue
the
speech
did
not
make
much
of
a
hit
the
fallen
women
moving
restlessly
about
a
large
woman
with
an
immense
nose
did
better
she
talked
with
a
swift
contagious
zeal
that
was
very
stirring
and
listening
to
her
sam
was
reminded
of
the
evening
when
he
sat
before
another
zealous
talker
in
the
church
at
caxton
and
jim
williams
the
barber
tried
to
stampede
him
into
the
fold
with
the
lambs
while
the
woman
talked
a
plump
little
member
of
the
who
sat
beside
sam
wept
copiously
but
at
the
end
of
the
speech
he
could
remember
nothing
of
what
had
been
said
and
he
wondered
if
the
weeping
woman
would
remember
to
express
his
determination
to
continue
being
sue
s
companion
and
partner
sam
during
one
winter
taught
a
class
of
young
men
at
a
settlement
house
in
the
factory
district
of
the
west
side
the
class
in
his
hands
was
unsuccessful
he
found
the
young
men
heavy
and
stupid
with
fatigue
after
the
day
of
labour
in
the
shops
and
more
inclined
to
fall
asleep
in
their
chairs
or
wander
away
one
at
a
time
to
loaf
and
smoke
on
a
nearby
corner
than
to
stay
in
the
room
listening
to
the
man
reading
or
talking
before
them
when
one
of
the
young
women
workers
came
into
the
room
they
sat
up
and
seemed
for
the
moment
interested
once
sam
heard
a
group
of
them
talking
of
these
women
workers
on
a
landing
in
a
darkened
stairway
the
experience
startled
sam
and
he
dropped
the
class
admitting
to
sue
his
failure
and
his
lack
of
interest
and
bowing
his
head
before
her
accusation
of
a
lack
of
the
love
of
men
later
by
the
fire
in
his
own
room
he
tried
to
draw
for
himself
a
moral
from
the
experience
why
should
i
love
these
men
he
asked
himself
they
are
what
i
might
have
been
few
of
the
men
i
have
known
have
loved
me
and
some
of
the
best
and
cleanest
of
them
have
worked
vigorously
for
my
defeat
life
is
a
battle
in
which
few
men
win
and
many
are
defeated
and
in
which
hate
and
fear
play
their
part
with
love
and
generosity
these
young
men
are
a
part
of
the
world
as
men
have
made
it
why
this
protest
against
their
fate
when
we
are
all
of
us
making
more
and
more
of
them
with
every
turn
of
the
clock
during
the
next
year
after
the
fiasco
of
the
settlement
house
class
sam
found
himself
drifting
more
and
more
rapidly
away
from
sue
and
her
new
viewpoint
of
life
the
growing
gulf
between
them
showed
itself
in
a
thousand
little
household
acts
and
impulses
and
every
time
he
looked
at
her
he
thought
her
more
apart
from
him
and
less
a
part
of
the
real
life
that
went
on
within
him
in
the
old
days
there
had
been
something
intimate
and
familiar
in
her
person
and
in
her
presence
she
had
seemed
like
a
part
of
him
like
the
room
in
which
he
slept
or
the
coat
he
wore
on
his
back
and
he
had
looked
into
her
eyes
as
thoughtlessly
and
with
as
little
fear
of
what
he
might
find
there
as
he
looked
at
his
own
hands
now
when
his
eyes
met
hers
they
dropped
and
one
or
the
other
of
them
began
talking
hurriedly
like
a
person
who
has
a
consciousness
of
something
he
must
conceal
down
town
sam
took
up
anew
his
old
friendship
and
intimacy
with
jack
prince
going
with
him
to
clubs
and
drinking
places
and
often
spending
evenings
among
the
clever
young
men
who
laughed
and
made
deals
and
talked
their
way
through
life
at
jack
s
side
among
these
young
men
a
business
associate
of
jack
s
caught
his
attention
and
in
a
few
weeks
an
intimacy
had
sprung
up
between
sam
and
this
man
maurice
morrison
sam
s
new
friend
had
been
discovered
by
jack
prince
working
as
a
on
a
country
daily
down
the
state
there
was
sam
thought
something
of
the
caxton
dandy
mike
mccarthy
in
the
man
combined
with
prolonged
and
fervent
although
somewhat
periodic
attacks
of
industry
in
his
youth
he
had
written
poetry
and
at
one
time
had
studied
for
the
ministry
and
in
chicago
under
jack
prince
he
had
developed
into
a
money
maker
and
led
the
life
of
a
talented
rather
unscrupulous
man
of
the
world
he
kept
a
mistress
often
overdrank
and
sam
thought
him
the
most
brilliant
and
convincing
talker
he
had
ever
heard
as
jack
prince
s
assistant
he
had
charge
of
the
rainey
company
s
large
advertising
expenditure
and
the
two
men
being
thrown
often
together
a
mutual
regard
grew
up
between
them
sam
believed
him
to
be
without
moral
sense
he
knew
him
to
be
able
and
honest
and
he
found
in
the
association
with
him
a
fund
of
odd
little
sweetnesses
of
character
and
action
that
lent
an
inexpressible
charm
to
the
person
of
his
friend
it
was
through
morrison
that
sam
had
his
first
serious
misunderstanding
with
sue
one
evening
the
brilliant
young
advertising
man
dined
at
the
mcphersons
the
table
as
usual
was
filled
with
sue
s
new
friends
among
them
a
tall
gaunt
man
who
with
the
arrival
of
the
coffee
began
in
a
earnest
voice
to
talk
of
the
coming
social
revolution
sam
looked
across
the
table
and
saw
a
light
dancing
in
morrison
s
eyes
like
a
hound
unleashed
he
sprang
among
sue
s
friends
tearing
the
rich
to
pieces
calling
for
the
onward
advance
of
the
masses
quoting
odds
and
ends
of
shelley
and
carlyle
peering
earnestly
up
and
down
the
table
and
at
the
end
quite
winning
the
hearts
of
the
women
by
a
defence
of
fallen
women
that
stirred
the
blood
of
even
his
friend
and
host
sam
was
amused
and
a
trifle
annoyed
the
whole
thing
was
he
knew
no
more
than
a
piece
of
downright
acting
with
just
the
touch
of
sincerity
in
it
that
was
characteristic
of
the
man
but
that
had
no
depth
or
real
meaning
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
watched
sue
wondering
if
she
too
had
fathomed
morrison
and
what
she
thought
of
his
having
taken
the
role
of
star
from
the
long
gaunt
man
who
had
evidently
been
booked
for
that
part
and
who
sat
at
the
table
and
wandered
afterward
among
the
guests
annoyed
and
disconcerted
late
that
night
sue
came
into
his
room
and
found
him
reading
and
smoking
by
the
fire
cheeky
of
morrison
dimming
your
star
he
said
looking
at
her
and
laughing
apologetically
sue
looked
at
him
doubtfully
i
came
in
to
thank
you
for
bringing
him
she
said
i
thought
him
sam
looked
at
her
and
for
a
moment
was
tempted
to
let
the
matter
pass
and
then
his
old
inclination
to
be
always
open
and
frank
with
her
asserted
itself
and
he
closed
the
book
and
rising
stood
looking
down
at
her
the
little
beast
was
guying
your
crowd
he
said
but
i
do
not
want
him
to
guy
you
not
that
he
wouldn
t
try
he
has
the
audacity
for
a
flush
arose
to
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
gleamed
that
is
not
true
sam
she
said
coldly
you
say
that
because
you
are
becoming
hard
and
cold
and
cynical
your
friend
morrison
talked
from
his
heart
it
was
beautiful
men
like
you
who
have
a
strong
influence
over
him
may
lead
him
away
but
in
the
end
a
man
like
that
will
come
to
give
his
life
to
the
service
of
society
you
should
help
him
not
assume
an
attitude
of
unbelief
and
laugh
at
sam
stood
upon
the
hearth
smoking
his
pipe
and
looking
at
her
he
was
thinking
how
easy
it
would
have
been
in
the
first
year
after
their
marriage
to
have
explained
morrison
now
he
felt
that
he
was
but
making
a
bad
matter
worse
but
went
on
determined
to
stick
to
his
policy
of
being
entirely
honest
with
her
look
here
sue
he
began
quietly
be
a
good
sport
morrison
was
joking
i
know
the
man
he
is
the
friend
of
men
like
me
because
he
wants
to
be
and
because
it
pays
him
to
be
he
is
a
talker
a
writer
a
talented
unscrupulous
he
is
making
a
big
salary
by
taking
the
ideas
of
men
like
me
and
expressing
them
better
than
we
can
ourselves
he
is
a
good
workman
and
a
generous
fellow
with
a
lot
of
nameless
charm
in
him
but
a
man
of
convictions
he
is
not
he
could
talk
tears
into
the
eyes
of
your
fallen
women
but
he
would
be
a
lot
more
likely
to
talk
good
women
into
their
sam
put
a
hand
upon
her
shoulder
be
sensible
and
do
not
be
offended
he
went
on
take
the
fellow
for
what
he
is
and
be
glad
for
him
he
hurts
little
and
cheers
a
lot
he
could
make
a
convincing
argument
in
favour
of
civilisation
s
return
to
cannibalism
but
really
you
know
he
spends
most
of
his
time
thinking
and
writing
of
washing
machines
and
ladies
hats
and
liver
pills
and
most
of
his
eloquence
after
all
only
comes
down
to
send
for
catalogue
department
k
in
the
sue
s
voice
was
colourless
with
passion
when
she
replied
this
is
unbearable
why
did
you
bring
the
fellow
here
sam
sat
down
and
picked
up
his
book
in
his
impatience
he
lied
to
her
for
the
first
time
since
their
marriage
first
because
i
like
him
and
second
because
i
wanted
to
see
if
i
couldn
t
produce
a
man
who
could
outsentimentalise
your
socialist
friends
he
said
quietly
sue
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
room
in
a
way
the
action
was
final
and
marked
the
end
of
understanding
between
them
putting
down
his
book
sam
watched
her
go
and
some
feeling
he
had
kept
for
her
and
that
had
differentiated
her
from
all
other
women
died
in
him
as
the
door
closed
between
them
throwing
the
book
aside
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
looking
at
the
door
the
old
goodfellowship
appeal
is
dead
he
thought
from
now
on
we
will
have
to
explain
and
apologise
like
two
strangers
no
more
taking
each
other
for
turning
out
the
light
he
sat
again
before
the
fire
to
think
his
way
through
the
situation
that
faced
him
he
had
no
thought
that
she
would
return
that
last
shot
of
his
own
had
crushed
the
possibility
of
that
the
fire
was
getting
low
in
the
grate
and
he
did
not
renew
it
he
looked
past
it
toward
the
darkened
windows
and
heard
the
hum
of
motor
cars
along
the
boulevard
below
again
he
was
the
boy
of
caxton
hungrily
seeking
an
end
in
life
the
flushed
face
of
the
woman
in
the
theatre
danced
before
his
eyes
he
remembered
with
shame
how
he
had
a
few
days
before
stood
in
a
doorway
and
followed
with
his
eyes
the
figure
of
a
woman
who
had
lifted
her
eyes
to
him
as
they
passed
in
the
street
he
wished
that
he
might
go
out
of
the
house
for
a
walk
with
john
telfer
and
have
his
mind
filled
with
eloquence
of
the
standing
corn
or
sit
at
the
feet
of
janet
eberly
as
she
talked
of
books
and
of
life
he
got
up
and
turning
on
the
lights
began
preparing
for
bed
i
know
what
i
will
do
he
said
i
will
go
to
work
i
will
do
some
real
work
and
make
some
more
money
that
s
the
place
for
and
to
work
he
went
real
work
the
most
sustained
and
clearly
work
he
had
done
for
two
years
he
was
out
of
the
house
at
dawn
for
a
long
bracing
walk
in
the
fresh
morning
air
to
be
followed
by
eight
ten
and
even
fifteen
hours
in
the
office
and
shops
hours
in
which
he
drove
the
rainey
arms
company
s
organisation
mercilessly
and
taking
openly
every
vestige
of
the
management
out
of
the
hands
of
colonel
tom
began
the
plans
for
the
consolidation
of
the
american
firearms
companies
that
later
put
his
name
on
the
front
pages
of
the
newspapers
and
got
him
the
title
of
a
captain
of
finance
there
is
a
widespread
misunderstanding
abroad
regarding
the
motives
of
many
of
the
american
millionaires
who
sprang
into
prominence
and
affluence
in
the
days
of
change
and
sudden
bewildering
growth
that
followed
the
close
of
the
spanish
war
they
were
many
of
them
not
of
the
brute
trader
type
but
were
instead
men
who
thought
and
acted
quickly
and
with
a
daring
and
audacity
impossible
to
the
average
mind
they
wanted
power
and
were
many
of
them
entirely
unscrupulous
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
men
with
a
fire
burning
within
them
men
who
became
what
they
were
because
the
world
offered
them
no
better
outlet
for
their
vast
energies
sam
mcpherson
had
been
untiring
and
without
scruples
in
the
first
hard
quick
struggle
to
get
his
head
above
the
great
unknown
body
of
men
there
in
the
city
he
had
turned
aside
from
money
getting
when
he
heard
what
he
took
to
be
a
call
to
a
better
way
of
life
now
with
the
fires
of
youth
still
in
him
and
with
the
training
and
discipline
that
had
come
from
two
years
of
reading
of
comparative
leisure
and
of
thought
he
was
prepared
to
give
the
chicago
business
world
a
display
of
that
tremendous
energy
that
was
to
write
his
name
in
the
industrial
history
of
the
city
as
one
of
the
first
of
the
western
giants
of
finance
going
to
sue
sam
told
her
frankly
of
his
plans
i
want
a
free
hand
in
the
handling
of
your
stock
in
the
company
he
said
i
can
not
lead
this
new
life
of
yours
it
may
help
and
sustain
you
but
it
gets
no
hold
on
me
i
want
to
be
myself
now
and
lead
my
own
life
in
my
own
way
i
want
to
run
the
company
really
run
it
i
can
not
stand
idly
by
and
let
life
go
past
i
am
hurting
myself
and
you
standing
here
looking
on
also
i
am
in
a
kind
of
danger
of
another
kind
that
i
want
to
avoid
by
throwing
myself
into
hard
constructive
without
question
sue
signed
the
papers
he
brought
her
a
flash
of
her
old
frankness
toward
him
came
back
i
do
not
blame
you
sam
she
said
smiling
bravely
things
have
not
gone
right
as
we
both
know
but
if
we
can
not
work
together
at
least
let
us
not
hurt
each
when
sam
returned
to
give
himself
again
to
affairs
the
country
was
just
at
the
beginning
of
the
great
wave
of
consolidation
which
was
finally
to
sweep
all
of
the
financial
power
of
the
country
into
a
dozen
pairs
of
competent
and
entirely
efficient
hands
with
the
sure
instinct
of
the
born
trader
sam
had
seen
this
movement
coming
and
had
studied
it
now
he
began
to
act
going
to
that
same
lawyer
who
had
drawn
the
contract
for
him
to
secure
control
of
the
medical
student
s
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
who
had
jokingly
invited
him
to
become
one
of
a
band
of
train
robbers
he
told
him
of
his
plans
to
begin
working
toward
a
consolidation
of
all
the
firearms
companies
of
the
country
webster
wasted
no
time
in
joking
now
he
laid
out
the
plans
adjusted
and
readjusted
them
to
suit
sam
s
shrewd
suggestions
and
when
a
fee
was
mentioned
shook
his
head
i
want
in
on
this
he
said
you
will
need
me
i
am
made
for
this
game
and
have
been
waiting
for
a
chance
to
get
at
it
just
count
me
in
as
one
of
the
promoters
if
you
sam
nodded
his
head
within
a
week
he
had
formed
a
pool
of
his
own
company
s
stock
controlling
as
he
thought
a
safe
majority
and
had
begun
working
to
form
a
similar
pool
in
the
stock
of
his
only
big
western
rival
this
last
job
was
not
an
easy
one
lewis
the
jew
had
been
making
constant
headway
in
that
company
just
as
sam
had
made
headway
in
the
rainey
company
he
was
a
money
maker
a
sales
manager
of
rare
ability
and
as
sam
knew
a
planner
and
executor
of
business
coups
of
the
first
class
sam
did
not
want
to
deal
with
lewis
he
had
respect
for
the
man
s
ability
in
driving
sharp
bargains
and
felt
that
he
would
like
to
have
the
whip
in
his
own
hands
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
dealing
with
him
to
this
end
he
began
visiting
bankers
and
the
men
who
were
head
of
big
western
trust
companies
in
chicago
and
louis
he
went
about
his
work
slowly
feeling
his
way
and
trying
to
get
at
each
man
by
some
effective
appeal
buying
the
use
of
vast
sums
of
money
by
a
promise
of
common
stock
the
bait
of
a
big
active
bank
account
and
here
and
there
by
the
hint
of
a
directorship
in
the
big
new
consolidated
company
for
a
time
the
project
moved
slowly
indeed
there
were
weeks
and
months
when
it
did
not
appear
to
move
at
all
working
in
secret
and
with
extreme
caution
sam
encountered
many
discouragements
and
went
home
in
the
evening
day
after
day
to
sit
among
sue
s
guests
with
a
mind
filled
with
his
own
plans
and
with
an
indifferent
ear
turned
to
the
talk
of
revolution
social
unrest
and
the
new
class
consciousness
of
the
masses
that
rattled
and
crackled
up
and
down
his
dinner
table
he
thought
that
it
must
be
trying
to
sue
he
was
so
evidently
not
interested
in
her
interests
at
the
same
time
he
thought
that
he
was
working
toward
what
he
wanted
out
of
life
and
went
to
bed
at
night
believing
that
he
was
finding
and
would
find
a
kind
of
peace
in
just
thinking
clearly
along
one
line
day
after
day
one
day
webster
who
had
wanted
to
be
in
on
the
deal
came
to
sam
s
office
and
gave
his
project
its
first
great
boost
toward
success
he
like
sam
thought
he
saw
clearly
the
tendencies
of
the
times
and
was
greedy
for
the
block
of
common
stock
that
sam
had
promised
should
come
to
him
with
the
completion
of
the
enterprise
you
are
not
using
me
he
said
sitting
down
before
sam
s
desk
what
is
blocking
the
deal
sam
began
to
explain
and
when
he
had
finished
webster
laughed
let
s
get
at
tom
edwards
of
the
edward
arms
company
direct
he
said
and
then
leaning
over
the
desk
edwards
is
a
vain
little
peacock
and
a
second
rate
business
man
he
declared
emphatically
get
him
afraid
and
then
flatter
his
vanity
he
has
a
new
wife
with
blonde
hair
and
big
soft
blue
eyes
he
wants
prominence
he
is
afraid
to
venture
upon
big
things
himself
but
is
hungry
for
the
reputation
and
gain
that
comes
through
big
deals
use
the
method
the
jew
has
used
show
him
what
it
means
to
the
woman
to
be
the
wife
of
the
president
of
the
big
consolidated
arms
company
the
edwards
consolidated
eh
get
at
edwards
bluff
him
and
flatter
him
and
he
is
your
sam
wondered
edwards
was
a
small
man
of
sixty
with
something
dry
and
unresponsive
about
him
being
a
silent
man
he
had
created
an
impression
of
remarkable
shrewdness
and
ability
after
a
lifetime
spent
in
hard
labour
and
in
the
practice
of
the
most
rigid
economy
he
had
come
up
to
wealth
and
had
got
into
the
firearms
business
through
lewis
and
it
was
counted
one
of
the
brightest
stars
in
that
brilliant
hebrew
s
crown
that
he
had
been
able
to
lead
edwards
with
him
in
his
daring
and
audacious
handling
of
the
company
s
affairs
sam
looked
at
webster
across
the
desk
and
thought
of
tom
edwards
as
the
figurehead
of
the
firearms
trust
i
was
saving
the
frosting
on
the
cake
for
my
own
tom
he
said
it
was
a
thing
i
wanted
to
hand
the
let
us
see
edwards
this
evening
said
webster
dryly
sam
nodded
and
late
that
night
made
the
deal
that
gave
him
control
of
the
two
important
western
companies
and
put
him
in
position
to
move
on
the
eastern
companies
with
every
prospect
of
complete
success
to
edwards
he
went
with
an
exaggerated
report
of
the
support
he
had
already
got
for
his
project
and
having
frightened
him
offered
him
the
presidency
of
the
new
company
and
promised
that
it
should
be
incorporated
under
the
name
of
the
edwards
consolidated
firearms
company
of
america
the
eastern
companies
fell
quickly
with
webster
sam
tried
on
them
the
old
dodge
of
telling
each
that
the
other
two
had
agreed
to
come
in
and
it
worked
with
the
coming
in
of
edwards
and
the
options
given
by
the
eastern
companies
sam
began
to
get
also
the
support
of
the
lasalle
street
bankers
the
firearms
trust
was
one
of
the
few
big
consolidations
managed
wholly
in
the
west
and
after
two
or
three
of
the
bankers
had
agreed
to
help
finance
sam
s
plan
the
others
began
asking
to
be
taken
into
the
underwriting
syndicate
he
and
webster
had
formed
within
thirty
days
after
the
closing
of
the
deal
with
tom
edwards
sam
felt
that
he
was
ready
to
act
for
several
months
colonel
tom
had
known
something
of
the
plans
sam
had
on
foot
and
had
made
no
protest
he
had
in
fact
given
sam
to
understand
that
his
stock
would
be
voted
with
sue
s
controlled
by
sam
and
with
the
stock
of
the
other
directors
who
knew
of
and
hoped
to
share
in
the
profits
of
sam
s
deal
the
old
gunmaker
had
all
of
his
life
believed
that
the
other
american
firearms
companies
were
but
shadows
destined
to
disappear
before
the
rising
sun
of
the
rainey
company
and
thought
of
sam
s
project
as
an
act
of
providence
to
further
this
desirable
end
at
the
moment
of
his
acquiescence
in
webster
s
plan
for
landing
tom
edwards
sam
had
a
moment
of
doubt
and
now
with
the
success
of
his
project
in
sight
he
began
to
wonder
how
the
blustering
old
man
would
look
upon
edwards
as
the
titular
head
of
the
big
company
and
upon
the
name
of
edwards
in
the
title
of
the
company
for
two
years
sam
had
seen
little
of
the
colonel
who
had
given
up
all
pretence
to
an
active
part
in
the
management
of
the
business
and
who
finding
sue
s
new
friends
disconcerting
seldom
appeared
at
the
house
living
at
the
clubs
playing
billiards
all
day
long
or
sitting
in
the
club
windows
boasting
to
chance
listeners
of
his
part
in
the
building
of
the
rainey
arms
company
with
a
mind
filled
with
doubt
sam
went
home
and
put
the
matter
before
sue
she
was
dressed
and
ready
for
an
evening
at
the
theatre
with
a
party
of
friends
and
the
talk
was
brief
he
will
not
mind
she
said
indifferently
go
ahead
and
do
what
you
want
to
sam
rode
back
to
the
office
and
called
his
lieutenants
about
him
he
felt
that
the
thing
might
as
well
be
done
and
over
and
with
the
options
in
his
hands
and
the
ability
he
thought
he
had
to
control
his
own
company
he
was
ready
to
come
out
into
the
open
and
get
the
deal
cleaned
up
the
morning
papers
that
carried
the
story
of
the
proposed
big
new
consolidation
of
firearms
companies
carried
also
an
almost
halftone
of
colonel
tom
rainey
a
slightly
smaller
one
of
tom
edwards
and
grouped
about
these
small
pictures
of
sam
lewis
prince
webster
and
several
of
the
eastern
men
by
the
size
of
the
sam
prince
and
morrison
had
tried
to
reconcile
colonel
tom
to
edwards
name
in
the
title
of
the
new
company
and
to
edwards
coming
election
as
president
the
story
also
played
up
the
past
glories
of
the
rainey
company
and
its
directing
genius
colonel
tom
one
phrase
written
by
morrison
brought
a
smile
to
sam
s
lips
this
grand
old
patriarch
of
american
business
retired
now
from
active
service
is
like
a
tired
giant
who
having
raised
a
brood
of
young
giants
goes
into
his
castle
to
rest
and
reflect
and
to
count
the
scars
won
in
many
a
morrison
laughed
as
he
read
it
aloud
it
ought
to
get
the
colonel
he
said
but
the
newspaper
man
who
prints
it
should
be
they
will
print
it
all
right
said
jack
prince
and
they
did
print
it
going
from
newspaper
office
to
newspaper
office
prince
and
morrison
saw
to
that
using
their
influence
as
big
buyers
of
advertising
space
and
even
insisting
upon
reading
proof
on
their
own
masterpiece
but
it
did
not
work
early
the
next
morning
colonel
tom
appeared
at
the
offices
of
the
arms
company
with
blood
in
his
eye
and
swore
that
the
consolidation
should
not
be
put
through
for
an
hour
he
stormed
up
and
down
in
sam
s
office
his
outbursts
of
wrath
varied
by
periods
of
childlike
pleading
for
the
retention
of
the
name
and
glory
of
the
raineys
when
sam
shook
his
head
and
went
with
the
old
man
to
the
meeting
that
was
to
pass
upon
his
action
and
sell
the
rainey
company
he
knew
that
he
had
a
fight
on
his
hands
the
meeting
was
a
stormy
one
sam
made
a
talk
telling
what
had
been
done
and
webster
voting
some
of
sam
s
proxies
made
a
motion
that
sam
s
offer
for
the
old
company
be
accepted
and
then
colonel
tom
fired
his
guns
walking
up
and
down
in
the
room
before
the
men
sitting
at
a
long
table
or
in
chairs
tilted
against
the
walls
he
began
talking
with
all
of
his
old
flamboyant
pomposity
of
the
past
glories
of
the
rainey
company
sam
watched
him
quietly
thinking
of
the
exhibition
as
something
detached
and
apart
from
the
business
of
the
meeting
he
remembered
a
question
that
had
come
into
his
head
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
and
had
got
his
first
peep
into
a
school
history
there
had
been
a
picture
of
indians
at
the
war
dance
and
he
had
wondered
why
they
danced
before
rather
than
after
battle
now
his
mind
answered
the
question
if
they
had
not
danced
before
they
might
never
have
got
the
chance
he
thought
and
smiled
to
himself
i
call
upon
you
men
here
to
stick
to
the
old
colours
roared
the
colonel
turning
and
making
a
direct
attack
upon
sam
do
not
let
this
ungrateful
upstart
this
son
of
a
drunken
village
housepainter
that
i
picked
up
from
among
the
cabbages
of
south
water
street
win
you
away
from
your
loyalty
to
the
old
leader
do
not
let
him
steal
by
trickery
what
we
have
won
only
by
years
of
the
colonel
leaning
on
the
table
glared
about
the
room
sam
felt
relieved
and
glad
of
the
direct
attack
it
justifies
what
i
am
going
to
do
he
thought
when
colonel
tom
had
finished
sam
gave
a
careless
glance
at
the
old
man
s
red
face
and
trembling
fingers
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
outburst
of
eloquence
had
fallen
upon
deaf
ears
and
without
comment
put
webster
s
motion
to
the
vote
to
his
surprise
two
of
the
new
employé
directors
voted
their
stock
with
colonel
tom
s
and
a
third
man
voting
his
own
stock
as
well
as
that
of
a
wealthy
southside
real
estate
man
did
not
vote
on
a
count
the
stock
represented
stood
deadlocked
and
sam
looking
down
the
table
raised
his
eyebrows
to
webster
move
we
adjourn
for
hours
snapped
webster
and
the
motion
carried
sam
looked
at
a
paper
lying
before
him
on
the
table
during
the
count
of
the
vote
he
had
been
writing
over
and
over
on
the
sheet
of
paper
this
sentence
the
best
men
spend
their
lives
seeking
colonel
tom
walked
out
of
the
room
like
a
conqueror
declining
to
speak
to
sam
as
he
passed
and
sam
looked
down
the
table
at
webster
and
made
a
motion
with
his
head
toward
the
man
who
had
not
voted
within
an
hour
sam
s
fight
was
won
pouncing
upon
the
man
representing
the
stock
of
the
investor
he
and
webster
did
not
go
out
of
the
room
until
they
had
secured
absolute
control
of
the
rainey
company
and
the
man
who
had
refused
to
vote
had
put
thousand
dollars
into
his
pocket
the
two
employeé
directors
sam
marked
for
slaughter
then
after
spending
the
afternoon
and
early
evening
with
the
representatives
of
the
eastern
companies
and
their
attorneys
he
drove
home
to
sue
it
was
past
nine
o
clock
when
his
car
stopped
before
the
house
and
going
at
once
to
his
room
he
found
sue
sitting
before
his
fire
her
arms
thrown
above
her
head
and
her
eyes
staring
at
the
burning
coals
as
sam
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
at
her
a
wave
of
resentment
swept
over
him
the
old
coward
he
thought
he
has
brought
our
fight
here
to
hanging
up
his
coat
he
filled
his
pipe
and
drawing
up
a
chair
sat
beside
her
for
five
minutes
sue
sat
staring
into
the
fire
when
she
spoke
there
was
a
touch
of
hardness
in
her
voice
when
everything
is
said
sam
you
do
owe
a
lot
to
father
she
observed
refusing
to
look
at
him
sam
said
nothing
and
she
went
on
not
that
i
think
we
made
you
father
and
i
you
are
not
the
kind
of
man
that
people
make
or
unmake
but
sam
sam
think
what
you
are
doing
he
has
always
been
a
fool
in
your
hands
he
used
to
come
home
here
when
you
were
new
with
the
company
and
talk
of
what
he
was
doing
he
had
a
whole
new
set
of
ideas
and
phrases
all
that
about
waste
and
efficiency
and
orderly
working
toward
a
definite
end
it
did
not
fool
me
i
knew
the
ideas
and
even
the
phrases
he
used
to
express
them
were
not
his
and
i
was
not
long
finding
out
they
were
yours
that
it
was
simply
you
expressing
yourself
through
him
he
is
a
big
helpless
child
sam
and
he
is
old
he
hasn
t
much
longer
to
live
do
not
be
hard
sam
be
her
voice
did
not
tremble
but
tears
ran
down
her
rigid
face
and
her
expressive
hands
clutched
at
her
dress
can
nothing
change
you
must
you
always
have
your
own
way
she
added
still
refusing
to
look
at
him
it
is
not
true
sue
that
i
always
want
my
own
way
and
people
do
change
me
you
have
changed
me
he
said
she
shook
her
head
no
i
have
not
changed
you
i
found
you
hungry
for
something
and
you
thought
i
could
feed
it
i
gave
you
an
idea
that
you
took
hold
of
and
made
your
own
i
do
not
know
where
i
got
it
from
some
book
or
hearing
some
one
talk
i
suppose
but
it
belonged
to
you
you
built
it
and
fostered
it
in
me
and
coloured
it
with
your
own
personality
it
is
your
idea
it
means
more
to
you
than
all
this
firearms
trust
that
the
papers
are
full
she
turned
to
look
at
him
and
put
out
her
hand
and
laid
it
in
his
i
have
not
been
brave
she
said
i
am
standing
in
your
way
i
have
had
a
hope
that
we
would
get
back
to
each
other
i
should
have
freed
you
but
i
hadn
t
the
courage
i
hadn
t
the
courage
i
could
not
give
up
the
dream
that
some
day
you
would
really
take
me
back
to
getting
out
of
her
chair
she
dropped
to
her
knees
and
putting
her
head
in
his
lap
shook
with
sobs
sam
sat
stroking
her
hair
her
agitation
was
so
great
that
her
muscular
little
back
shook
with
it
sam
looked
past
her
at
the
fire
and
tried
to
think
clearly
he
was
not
greatly
moved
by
her
agitation
but
with
all
his
heart
he
wanted
to
think
things
out
and
get
at
the
right
and
the
honest
thing
to
do
it
is
a
time
of
big
things
he
said
slowly
and
with
an
air
of
one
explaining
to
a
child
as
your
socialists
say
vast
changes
are
going
on
i
do
not
believe
that
your
socialists
really
sense
what
these
changes
mean
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do
or
that
any
man
does
but
i
know
they
mean
something
big
and
i
want
to
be
in
them
and
a
part
of
them
all
big
men
do
they
are
struggling
like
chicks
in
the
shell
why
look
here
what
i
am
doing
has
to
be
done
and
if
i
do
not
do
it
another
man
will
the
colonel
has
to
go
he
will
be
swept
aside
he
belongs
to
something
old
and
outworn
your
socialists
i
believe
call
it
the
age
of
but
not
by
us
not
by
you
sam
she
plead
after
all
he
is
my
a
stern
look
came
into
sam
s
eyes
it
does
not
ring
right
sue
he
said
coldly
fathers
do
not
mean
much
to
me
i
choked
my
own
father
and
threw
him
into
the
street
when
i
was
only
a
boy
you
knew
about
that
you
heard
of
it
when
you
went
to
find
out
about
me
that
time
in
caxton
mary
underwood
told
you
i
did
it
because
he
lied
and
believed
in
lies
do
not
your
friends
say
that
the
individual
who
stands
in
the
way
should
be
crushed
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
stood
before
him
do
not
quote
that
crowd
she
burst
out
they
are
not
the
real
thing
do
you
suppose
i
do
not
know
that
do
i
not
know
that
they
come
here
because
they
hope
to
get
hold
of
you
haven
t
i
watched
them
and
seen
the
look
on
their
faces
when
you
have
not
come
or
have
not
listened
to
their
talk
they
are
afraid
of
you
all
of
them
that
s
why
they
talk
so
bitterly
they
are
afraid
and
ashamed
that
they
are
like
the
workers
in
the
shop
he
asked
musingly
yes
like
that
and
like
me
since
i
failed
in
my
part
of
our
lives
and
had
not
the
courage
to
get
out
of
the
way
you
are
worth
all
of
us
and
for
all
our
talk
we
shall
never
succeed
or
begin
to
succeed
until
we
make
men
like
you
want
what
we
want
they
know
that
and
i
know
and
what
do
you
want
i
want
you
to
be
big
and
generous
you
can
be
failure
can
not
hurt
you
you
and
men
like
you
can
do
anything
you
can
even
fail
i
can
not
none
of
us
can
i
can
not
put
my
father
to
that
shame
i
want
you
to
accept
sam
got
up
and
taking
her
by
the
arm
led
her
to
the
door
at
the
door
he
turned
her
about
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
like
a
lover
all
right
sue
girl
i
will
do
it
he
said
and
pushed
her
through
the
door
now
let
me
sit
down
by
myself
and
think
things
it
was
a
night
in
september
and
a
whisper
of
the
coming
frost
was
in
the
air
he
threw
up
the
window
and
took
long
breaths
of
the
sharp
air
and
listened
to
the
rumble
of
the
elevated
road
in
the
distance
looking
up
the
boulevard
he
saw
the
lights
of
the
cyclists
making
a
glistening
stream
that
flowed
past
the
house
a
thought
of
his
new
motor
car
and
of
all
of
the
wonder
of
the
mechanical
progress
of
the
world
ran
through
his
mind
the
men
who
make
machines
do
not
hesitate
he
said
to
himself
even
though
a
thousand
men
stood
in
their
way
they
would
go
a
line
of
tennyson
s
came
into
his
mind
and
the
nation
s
airy
navies
grappling
in
the
central
blue
he
quoted
thinking
of
an
article
he
had
read
predicting
the
coming
of
airships
he
thought
of
the
lives
of
the
workers
in
steel
and
iron
and
of
the
things
they
had
done
and
would
do
they
have
he
thought
freedom
steel
and
iron
do
not
run
home
to
carry
the
struggle
to
women
sitting
by
the
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
fat
old
coward
damned
fat
old
coward
he
muttered
over
and
over
to
himself
it
was
past
midnight
when
he
got
into
bed
and
began
trying
to
quiet
himself
for
sleep
in
his
dreams
he
saw
a
fat
man
with
a
chorus
girl
hanging
to
his
arm
kicking
his
head
about
a
bridge
above
a
swiftly
flowing
stream
when
he
got
down
to
the
breakfast
room
the
next
morning
sue
had
gone
by
his
plate
he
found
a
note
saying
that
she
had
gone
for
colonel
tom
and
would
take
him
to
the
country
for
the
day
he
walked
to
the
office
thinking
of
the
incapable
old
man
who
in
the
name
of
sentiment
had
beaten
him
in
what
he
thought
the
big
enterprise
of
his
life
at
his
desk
he
found
a
message
from
webster
the
old
turkey
cock
has
fled
it
said
we
should
have
saved
the
on
the
phone
webster
told
sam
of
an
early
visit
to
the
club
to
see
colonel
tom
and
that
the
old
man
had
left
the
city
going
to
the
country
for
the
day
it
was
on
sam
s
lips
to
tell
of
his
changed
plans
but
he
hesitated
i
will
see
you
at
your
office
in
an
hour
he
said
outside
again
in
the
open
air
sam
walked
and
thought
of
his
promise
down
by
the
lake
he
went
to
where
the
railroad
with
the
lake
beyond
stopped
him
upon
the
old
wooden
bridge
looking
over
the
track
and
down
to
the
water
he
stood
as
he
had
stood
at
other
crises
in
his
life
and
thought
over
the
struggle
of
the
night
before
in
the
clear
morning
air
with
the
roar
of
the
city
behind
him
and
the
still
waters
of
the
lake
in
front
the
tears
and
the
talk
with
sue
seemed
but
a
part
of
the
ridiculous
and
sentimental
attitude
of
her
father
and
the
promise
given
her
insignificant
and
unfairly
won
he
reviewed
the
scene
carefully
the
talk
and
the
tears
and
the
promise
given
as
he
led
her
to
the
door
it
all
seemed
far
away
and
unreal
like
some
promise
made
to
a
girl
in
his
boyhood
it
was
never
a
part
of
all
this
he
said
turning
and
looking
at
the
towering
city
before
him
for
an
hour
he
stood
on
the
wooden
bridge
he
thought
of
windy
mcpherson
putting
the
bugle
to
his
lips
in
the
streets
of
caxton
and
again
there
sounded
in
his
ears
the
roaring
laugh
of
the
crowd
again
he
lay
in
the
bed
beside
colonel
tom
in
that
northern
city
and
saw
the
moon
rising
over
the
round
paunch
and
heard
the
empty
chattering
talk
of
love
love
he
said
still
looking
toward
the
city
is
a
matter
of
truth
not
lies
and
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
he
went
forward
truthfully
he
should
get
even
sue
back
again
some
time
his
mind
lingered
over
the
thoughts
of
the
loves
that
come
to
a
man
in
the
world
of
sue
in
the
northern
woods
and
of
janet
in
her
in
the
little
room
where
the
cable
cars
ran
rumbling
under
the
window
and
he
thought
of
other
things
of
sue
reading
papers
culled
out
of
books
before
the
fallen
women
in
the
little
state
street
hall
of
tom
edwards
with
his
new
wife
and
his
little
watery
eyes
of
morrison
and
the
socialist
fighting
over
words
at
his
table
and
then
pulling
on
his
gloves
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
went
back
through
the
crowded
streets
to
his
office
to
do
the
thing
he
had
determined
on
at
the
meeting
that
afternoon
the
project
went
through
without
a
dissenting
voice
colonel
tom
being
absent
the
two
employé
directors
voted
with
sam
with
almost
panicky
haste
as
sam
looking
across
at
the
webster
laughed
and
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
and
then
he
voted
the
stock
sue
had
intrusted
to
him
for
the
project
feeling
that
in
doing
so
he
was
cutting
perhaps
for
all
time
the
knot
that
bound
them
with
the
completion
of
the
deal
sam
stood
to
win
five
million
dollars
more
money
than
colonel
tom
or
any
of
the
raineys
had
ever
controlled
and
had
placed
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
business
men
of
chicago
and
new
york
where
before
he
had
placed
himself
in
the
eyes
of
caxton
and
south
water
street
instead
of
another
windy
mcpherson
failing
to
blow
his
bugle
before
the
waiting
crowd
he
was
still
the
man
who
made
good
the
man
who
achieved
the
kind
of
man
of
whom
america
boasts
before
the
world
he
did
not
see
sue
again
when
the
news
of
his
betrayal
reached
her
she
went
off
east
taking
colonel
tom
with
her
and
sam
closed
the
house
even
sending
a
man
there
for
his
clothes
to
her
eastern
address
got
from
her
attorney
he
wrote
a
brief
note
offering
to
make
over
to
her
or
to
colonel
tom
his
entire
winnings
from
the
deal
and
closed
it
with
the
brutal
declaration
at
the
end
i
could
not
be
an
ass
even
for
to
this
note
sam
got
a
cold
brief
reply
telling
him
to
dispose
of
her
stock
in
the
company
and
of
that
belonging
to
colonel
tom
and
naming
an
eastern
trust
company
to
receive
the
money
with
colonel
tom
s
help
she
had
made
a
careful
estimate
of
the
values
of
their
holdings
at
the
time
of
consolidation
and
refused
flatly
to
accept
a
penny
beyond
that
amount
sam
felt
that
another
chapter
of
his
life
was
closed
webster
edwards
prince
and
the
eastern
men
met
and
elected
him
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
new
company
and
the
public
bought
eagerly
the
river
of
common
stock
he
turned
upon
the
market
prince
and
morrison
doing
masterful
work
in
the
moulding
of
public
opinion
through
the
press
the
first
board
meeting
ended
with
a
dinner
at
which
wine
flowed
in
rivulets
and
edwards
getting
drunk
stood
up
at
his
place
and
boasted
of
the
beauty
of
his
young
wife
and
sam
at
his
desk
in
his
new
offices
in
the
rookery
settled
down
grimly
to
the
playing
of
his
role
as

business
chapter
ix
the
story
of
sam
s
life
there
in
chicago
for
the
next
several
years
ceases
to
be
the
story
of
a
man
and
becomes
the
story
of
a
type
a
crowd
a
gang
what
he
and
the
group
of
men
surrounding
him
and
making
money
with
him
did
in
chicago
other
men
and
other
groups
of
men
have
done
in
new
york
in
paris
in
london
coming
into
power
with
the
great
expansive
wave
of
prosperity
that
attended
the
first
mckinley
administration
these
men
went
mad
of
money
making
they
played
with
great
industrial
institutions
and
railroad
systems
like
excited
children
and
a
man
of
chicago
won
the
notice
and
something
of
the
admiration
of
the
world
by
his
willingness
to
bet
a
million
dollars
on
the
turn
of
the
weather
in
the
years
of
criticism
and
readjustment
that
followed
this
period
of
sporadic
growth
writers
have
told
with
great
clearness
how
the
thing
was
done
and
some
of
the
participants
captains
of
industry
turned
penmen
caesars
become
have
bruited
the
story
to
an
admiring
world
given
the
time
the
inclination
the
power
of
the
press
and
the
unscrupulousness
the
thing
that
sam
mcpherson
and
his
followers
did
in
chicago
in
not
difficult
advised
by
webster
and
the
talented
prince
and
morrison
to
handle
his
publicity
work
he
rapidly
unloaded
his
huge
holdings
of
common
stock
upon
an
eager
public
keeping
for
himself
the
bonds
which
he
hypothecated
at
the
banks
to
increase
his
working
capital
while
continuing
to
control
the
company
when
the
common
stock
was
unloaded
he
with
a
group
of
fellow
spirits
began
an
attack
upon
it
through
the
stock
market
and
in
the
press
and
bought
it
again
at
a
low
figure
holding
it
ready
to
unload
when
the
public
should
have
forgotten
the
annual
advertising
expenditure
of
the
firearms
trust
ran
into
millions
and
sam
s
hold
upon
the
press
of
the
country
was
almost
unbelievably
strong
morrison
rapidly
developed
unusual
daring
and
audacity
in
using
this
instrument
and
making
it
serve
sam
s
ends
he
suppressed
facts
created
illusions
and
used
the
newspapers
as
a
whip
to
crack
at
the
heels
of
congressmen
senators
and
legislators
of
the
various
states
when
such
matters
as
appropriation
for
firearms
came
before
them
and
sam
who
had
undertaken
the
consolidation
of
the
firearms
companies
having
a
dream
of
himself
as
a
great
master
in
that
field
a
sort
of
american
krupp
rapidly
awoke
from
the
dream
to
take
the
bigger
chances
for
gain
in
the
world
of
speculation
within
a
year
he
dropped
edwards
as
head
of
the
firearms
trust
and
in
his
place
put
lewis
with
morrison
as
secretary
and
manager
of
sales
guided
by
sam
these
two
like
the
little
drygoods
merchant
of
the
old
rainey
company
went
from
capital
to
capital
and
from
city
to
city
making
contracts
influencing
news
placing
advertising
contracts
where
they
would
do
the
most
good
fixing
men
and
in
the
meantime
sam
with
webster
a
banker
named
crofts
who
had
profited
largely
in
the
firearms
merger
and
sometimes
morrison
or
prince
began
a
series
of
stock
raids
speculations
and
manipulations
that
attracted
attention
and
became
known
to
the
newspaper
reading
world
as
the
mcpherson
chicago
crowd
they
were
in
oil
railroads
coal
western
land
mining
timber
and
street
railways
one
summer
sam
with
prince
built
ran
to
a
profit
and
sold
to
advantage
a
huge
amusement
park
through
his
head
day
after
day
marched
columns
of
figures
ideas
schemes
more
and
more
spectacular
opportunities
for
gain
some
of
the
enterprises
in
which
he
engaged
while
because
of
their
size
they
seemed
more
dignified
were
of
reality
of
a
type
with
the
game
smuggling
of
his
south
water
street
days
and
in
all
of
his
operations
it
was
his
old
instinct
for
bargains
and
for
the
finding
of
buyers
together
with
webster
s
ability
for
carrying
through
questionable
deals
that
made
him
and
his
followers
almost
constantly
successful
in
the
face
of
opposition
from
the
more
conservative
business
and
financial
men
of
the
city
again
sam
led
a
new
life
owning
running
horses
at
the
tracks
memberships
in
many
clubs
a
country
house
in
wisconsin
and
shooting
preserves
in
texas
he
drank
steadily
played
poker
for
big
stakes
kept
in
the
public
prints
and
day
after
day
led
his
crew
upon
the
high
seas
of
finance
he
did
not
dare
think
and
in
his
heart
he
was
sick
of
it
sick
to
the
soul
so
that
when
thought
came
to
him
he
got
out
of
his
bed
to
seek
roistering
companions
or
getting
pen
and
paper
sat
for
hours
figuring
out
new
and
more
daring
schemes
for
money
making
the
great
forward
movement
in
modern
industry
of
which
he
had
dreamed
of
being
a
part
had
for
him
turned
out
to
be
a
huge
meaningless
gamble
with
loaded
dice
against
a
credulous
public
with
his
followers
he
went
on
day
after
day
doing
deeds
without
thought
industries
were
organised
and
launched
men
employed
and
thrown
out
of
employment
towns
wrecked
by
the
destruction
of
an
industry
and
other
towns
made
by
the
building
of
other
industries
at
a
whim
of
his
a
thousand
men
began
building
a
city
on
an
indiana
sand
hill
and
at
a
wave
of
his
hand
another
thousand
men
of
an
indiana
town
sold
their
homes
with
the
chicken
houses
in
the
and
vines
trained
by
the
kitchen
doors
and
rushed
to
buy
sections
of
the
hill
plotted
off
for
them
he
did
not
stop
to
discuss
with
his
followers
the
meaning
of
the
things
he
did
he
told
them
of
the
profits
to
be
made
and
then
having
done
the
thing
he
went
with
them
to
drink
in
bar
rooms
and
to
spend
the
evening
or
afternoon
singing
songs
visiting
his
stable
of
runners
or
more
often
sitting
silently
about
the
card
table
playing
for
high
stakes
making
millions
through
the
manipulation
of
the
public
during
the
day
he
sometimes
sat
half
the
night
struggling
with
his
companions
for
the
possession
of
thousands
lewis
the
jew
the
only
one
of
sam
s
companions
who
had
not
followed
him
in
his
spectacular
money
making
stayed
in
the
office
of
the
firearms
company
and
ran
it
like
the
scientific
able
man
of
business
he
was
while
sam
remained
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
company
and
had
an
office
a
desk
and
the
name
of
leadership
there
he
let
lewis
run
the
place
and
spent
his
own
time
upon
the
stock
exchange
or
in
some
corner
with
webster
and
crofts
planning
some
new
money
making
raid
you
have
the
better
of
it
lewis
he
said
one
day
in
a
reflective
mood
you
thought
i
had
cut
the
ground
from
under
you
when
i
got
tom
edwards
but
i
only
set
you
more
firmly
in
a
larger
he
made
a
movement
with
his
hand
toward
the
large
general
offices
with
the
rows
of
busy
clerks
and
the
substantial
look
of
work
being
done
i
might
have
had
the
work
you
are
doing
i
planned
and
schemed
with
that
end
in
view
he
added
lighting
a
cigar
and
going
out
at
the
door
and
the
money
hunger
got
you
laughed
lewis
looking
after
him
the
hunger
that
gets
jews
and
gentiles
and
all
who
feed
one
might
have
come
upon
the
mcpherson
chicago
crowd
about
the
old
chicago
stock
exchange
on
any
day
during
those
years
crofts
tall
abrupt
and
dogmatic
morrison
slender
dandified
and
gracious
webster
suave
gentlemanly
and
sam
silent
restless
and
often
morose
and
ugly
sometimes
it
seemed
to
sam
that
they
were
all
unreal
himself
and
the
men
with
him
he
watched
his
companions
cunningly
they
were
constantly
posing
before
the
passing
crowd
of
brokers
and
small
speculators
webster
coming
up
to
him
on
the
floor
of
the
exchange
would
tell
him
of
a
snowstorm
raging
outside
with
the
air
of
a
man
parting
with
a
secret
his
companions
went
from
one
to
the
other
vowing
eternal
friendships
and
then
keeping
spies
upon
each
other
they
hurried
to
sam
with
tales
of
secret
betrayals
into
any
deal
proposed
by
him
they
went
eagerly
although
sometimes
fearfully
and
almost
always
they
won
and
with
sam
they
made
millions
through
the
manipulation
of
the
firearms
company
and
the
chicago
and
northern
lake
railroad
which
he
controlled
in
later
years
sam
looked
back
upon
it
all
as
a
kind
of
nightmare
it
seemed
to
him
that
never
during
that
period
had
he
lived
or
thought
sanely
the
great
financial
leaders
that
he
saw
were
not
he
thought
great
men
some
of
them
like
webster
were
masters
of
craft
or
like
morrison
of
words
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
but
shrewd
greedy
vultures
feeding
upon
the
public
or
upon
each
other
in
the
meantime
sam
was
rapidly
degenerating
his
paunch
became
distended
and
his
hands
trembled
in
the
morning
being
a
man
of
strong
appetites
and
having
a
determination
to
avoid
women
he
almost
constantly
overdrank
and
overate
and
in
the
leisure
hours
that
came
to
him
he
hurried
eagerly
from
place
to
place
avoiding
thought
avoiding
sane
quiet
talk
avoiding
himself
all
of
his
companions
did
not
suffer
equally
webster
seemed
made
for
the
life
thriving
and
expanding
under
it
putting
his
winnings
steadily
aside
going
on
sunday
to
a
suburban
church
avoiding
the
publicity
connecting
his
name
with
race
horses
and
big
sporting
events
that
crofts
sought
and
to
which
sam
submitted
one
day
sam
and
crofts
caught
him
in
an
effort
to
sell
them
out
to
a
group
of
new
york
bankers
in
a
mining
deal
and
turned
the
trick
on
him
instead
whereupon
he
went
off
to
new
york
to
become
a
respectable
big
business
man
and
the
friend
of
senators
and
philanthropists
crofts
was
a
man
with
chronic
domestic
troubles
one
of
those
men
who
begin
each
day
by
cursing
their
wives
before
their
associates
and
yet
continue
living
with
them
year
after
year
there
was
a
kind
of
rough
squareness
in
the
man
and
after
the
completion
of
a
successful
deal
he
would
be
as
happy
as
a
boy
pounding
men
on
the
back
shaking
with
laughter
throwing
money
about
making
crude
jokes
after
sam
left
chicago
he
finally
divorced
his
wife
and
married
an
actress
from
the
vaudeville
stage
and
after
losing
of
his
fortune
in
an
effort
to
capture
control
of
a
southern
railroad
went
to
england
and
coached
by
the
actress
wife
developed
into
an
english
country
gentleman
and
sam
was
a
man
sick
day
after
day
he
went
on
drinking
more
and
more
heavily
playing
for
bigger
and
bigger
stakes
allowing
himself
less
and
less
thought
of
himself
one
day
he
received
a
long
letter
from
john
telfer
telling
of
the
sudden
death
of
mary
underwood
and
berating
him
for
his
neglect
of
her
she
was
ill
for
a
year
and
without
an
income
wrote
telfer
sam
noticed
that
the
man
s
hand
had
begun
to
tremble
she
lied
to
me
and
told
me
you
had
sent
her
money
but
now
that
she
is
dead
i
find
that
though
she
wrote
you
she
got
no
answer
her
old
aunt
told
sam
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
and
going
into
one
of
his
clubs
began
drinking
with
a
crowd
of
men
he
found
idling
there
he
had
paid
little
attention
to
his
correspondence
for
months
no
doubt
the
letter
from
mary
had
been
received
by
his
secretary
and
thrown
aside
with
the
letters
of
thousands
of
other
women
begging
letters
amorous
letters
letters
directed
at
him
because
of
his
wealth
and
the
prominence
given
his
exploits
by
the
newspapers
after
wiring
an
explanation
and
mailing
a
check
the
size
of
which
filled
john
telfer
with
admiration
sam
with
a
half
dozen
fellow
roisterers
spent
the
late
afternoon
and
evening
going
from
saloon
to
saloon
through
the
south
side
when
he
got
to
his
apartments
late
that
night
his
head
was
reeling
and
his
mind
filled
with
distorted
memories
of
drinking
men
and
women
and
of
himself
standing
on
a
table
in
some
obscure
drinking
place
and
calling
upon
the
shouting
laughing
of
his
crowd
of
rich
money
spenders
to
think
and
to
work
and
to
seek
truth
he
went
to
sleep
in
his
chair
his
mind
filled
with
the
dancing
faces
of
dead
women
mary
underwood
and
janet
and
sue
faces
calling
to
him
when
he
awoke
and
shaved
he
went
out
into
the
street
and
to
another
club
i
wonder
if
sue
is
dead
too
he
muttered
remembering
his
dream
at
the
club
he
was
called
to
the
telephone
by
lewis
who
asked
him
to
come
at
once
to
his
office
at
the
edwards
consolidated
when
he
got
there
he
found
a
wire
from
sue
in
a
moment
of
loneliness
and
despondency
over
the
loss
of
his
old
business
standing
and
reputation
colonel
tom
had
shot
himself
in
a
new
york
hotel
sam
sat
at
his
desk
fingering
the
yellow
paper
lying
before
him
and
fighting
to
get
his
head
clear
the
old
coward
the
damned
old
coward
he
muttered
any
one
could
have
done
when
lewis
came
into
sam
s
office
he
found
his
chief
sitting
at
his
desk
fingering
the
telegram
and
muttering
to
himself
when
sam
handed
him
the
wire
he
came
around
and
stood
beside
sam
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
well
do
not
blame
yourself
for
that
he
said
with
quick
understanding
i
don
t
sam
muttered
i
do
not
blame
myself
for
anything
i
am
a
result
not
a
cause
i
am
trying
to
think
i
am
not
through
yet
i
am
going
to
begin
again
when
i
get
things
thought
lewis
went
out
of
the
room
leaving
him
to
his
thoughts
for
an
hour
he
sat
there
reviewing
his
life
when
he
came
to
the
day
that
he
had
humiliated
colonel
tom
there
came
back
to
his
mind
the
sentence
he
had
written
on
the
sheet
of
paper
while
the
vote
was
being
counted
the
best
men
spend
their
lives
seeking
suddenly
he
came
to
a
decision
and
calling
lewis
began
laying
out
a
plan
of
action
his
head
cleared
and
the
ring
came
back
into
his
voice
to
lewis
he
gave
an
option
on
his
entire
holdings
of
edwards
consolidated
stocks
and
bonds
and
to
him
also
he
entrusted
the
clearing
up
of
deal
after
deal
in
which
he
was
interested
then
calling
a
broker
he
began
throwing
a
mass
of
stock
on
the
market
when
lewis
told
him
that
crofts
was
phoning
wildly
about
town
to
find
him
and
was
with
the
help
of
another
banker
supporting
the
market
and
taking
sam
s
stocks
as
fast
as
offered
he
laughed
and
giving
lewis
instructions
regarding
the
disposal
of
his
monies
walked
out
of
the
office
again
a
free
man
and
again
seeking
the
answer
to
his
problem
he
made
no
attempt
to
answer
sue
s
wire
he
was
restless
to
get
at
something
he
had
in
his
mind
he
went
to
his
apartments
and
packed
a
bag
and
from
there
disappeared
saying
goodbye
to
no
one
in
his
mind
was
no
definite
idea
of
where
he
was
going
or
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
knew
only
that
he
would
follow
the
message
his
hand
had
written
he
would
try
to
spend
his
life
seeking
truth

chapter
i
one
day
when
the
youth
sam
mcpherson
was
new
in
the
city
he
went
on
a
sunday
afternoon
to
a
theatre
to
hear
a
sermon
the
sermon
was
delivered
by
a
small
boston
man
and
seemed
to
the
young
mcpherson
scholarly
and
well
thought
out
the
greatest
man
is
he
whose
deeds
affect
the
greatest
number
of
lives
the
speaker
had
said
and
the
thought
had
stuck
in
sam
s
mind
now
walking
along
the
street
carrying
his
travelling
bag
he
remembered
the
sermon
and
the
thought
and
shook
his
head
in
doubt
what
i
have
done
here
in
this
city
must
have
affected
thousands
of
lives
he
mused
and
felt
a
quickening
of
his
blood
at
just
letting
go
of
his
thoughts
as
he
had
not
dared
do
since
that
day
when
by
breaking
his
word
to
sue
he
had
started
on
his
career
as
a
business
giant
he
began
to
think
of
the
quest
on
which
he
had
started
and
had
keen
satisfaction
in
the
thought
of
what
he
should
do
i
will
begin
all
over
and
come
up
to
truth
through
work
he
told
himself
i
will
leave
the
money
hunger
behind
me
and
if
it
returns
i
will
come
back
here
to
chicago
and
see
my
fortune
piled
up
and
the
men
rushing
about
the
banks
and
the
stock
exchange
and
the
court
they
pay
to
such
fools
and
brutes
as
i
have
been
and
that
will
cure
into
the
illinois
central
station
he
went
a
strange
spectacle
a
smile
came
to
his
lips
as
he
sat
on
a
bench
along
the
wall
between
an
immigrant
from
russia
and
a
small
plump
farmer
s
wife
who
held
a
banana
in
her
hand
and
gave
bites
of
it
to
a
babe
lying
in
her
arms
he
an
american
multimillionaire
a
man
in
the
midst
of
his
one
who
had
realised
the
american
dream
to
have
sickened
at
the
feast
and
to
have
wandered
out
of
a
fashionable
club
with
a
bag
in
his
hand
and
a
roll
of
bills
in
his
pocket
and
to
have
come
on
this
strange
quest
to
seek
truth
to
seek
god
a
few
years
of
the
fast
greedy
living
in
the
city
that
had
seemed
so
splendid
to
the
iowa
boy
and
to
the
men
and
women
who
had
lived
in
his
town
and
then
a
woman
had
died
lonely
and
in
want
in
that
iowa
town
and
half
across
the
continent
a
fat
blustering
old
man
had
shot
himself
in
a
new
york
hotel
and
here
he
sat
leaving
his
bag
in
the
care
of
the
farmer
s
wife
he
walked
across
the
room
to
the
ticket
window
and
standing
there
watched
the
people
with
definite
destinations
in
mind
come
up
lay
down
money
and
taking
their
tickets
go
briskly
away
he
had
no
fear
of
being
known
although
his
name
and
his
picture
had
been
upon
the
front
pages
of
chicago
newspapers
for
years
he
felt
so
great
a
change
within
himself
from
just
the
resolution
he
had
taken
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
passing
unnoticed
a
thought
struck
him
looking
up
and
down
the
long
room
filled
with
its
strangely
assorted
clusters
of
men
and
women
a
sense
of
the
great
toiling
masses
of
people
the
labourers
the
small
merchants
the
skilled
mechanics
came
over
him
these
are
the
americans
he
began
telling
himself
these
people
with
children
beside
them
and
with
hard
daily
work
to
be
done
and
many
of
them
with
stunted
or
imperfectly
developed
bodies
not
crofts
not
morrison
and
i
but
these
others
who
toil
without
hope
of
luxury
and
wealth
who
make
up
the
armies
in
times
of
war
and
raise
up
boys
and
girls
to
do
the
work
of
the
world
in
their
he
fell
into
the
line
moving
toward
the
ticket
window
behind
a
old
man
who
carried
a
box
of
carpenter
tools
in
one
hand
and
a
bag
in
the
other
and
bought
a
ticket
to
the
same
illinois
town
to
which
the
old
man
was
bound
in
the
train
he
sat
beside
the
old
man
and
the
two
fell
into
quiet
talk
the
old
man
talking
of
his
family
he
had
a
son
married
and
living
in
the
illinois
town
to
which
he
was
going
of
whom
he
began
boasting
the
son
he
said
had
gone
to
that
town
and
had
prospered
there
owning
a
hotel
which
his
wife
managed
while
he
worked
as
a
builder
ed
he
said
keeps
fifty
or
sixty
men
going
all
summer
he
has
sent
for
me
to
come
and
take
charge
of
a
gang
he
knows
well
enough
i
will
get
the
work
out
of
from
ed
the
old
man
drifted
into
talk
of
himself
and
his
life
telling
bare
facts
with
directness
and
simplicity
and
making
no
effort
to
disguise
a
slight
turn
of
vanity
in
his
success
i
have
raised
seven
sons
and
made
them
all
good
workmen
and
they
are
all
doing
well
he
said
he
told
of
each
in
detail
one
who
had
taken
to
books
was
a
mechanical
engineer
in
a
manufacturing
town
in
new
england
the
mother
of
his
children
had
died
the
year
before
and
of
his
three
daughters
two
had
married
mechanics
the
third
sam
gathered
had
not
done
well
and
from
something
the
old
man
said
he
thought
she
had
perhaps
gone
the
wrong
way
there
in
chicago
to
the
old
man
sam
talked
of
god
and
of
a
man
s
effort
to
get
truth
out
of
life
i
have
thought
of
it
a
lot
he
said
the
old
man
was
interested
he
looked
at
sam
and
then
out
at
the
car
window
and
began
talking
of
his
own
beliefs
the
substance
of
which
sam
could
not
get
god
is
a
spirit
and
lives
in
the
growing
corn
said
the
old
man
pointing
out
the
window
at
the
passing
fields
he
began
talking
of
churches
and
of
ministers
against
whom
he
was
filled
with
bitterness
they
are
dodgers
they
do
not
get
at
things
they
are
damned
dodgers
pretending
to
be
good
he
declared
sam
talked
of
himself
saying
that
he
was
alone
in
the
world
and
had
money
he
said
that
he
wanted
work
in
the
open
air
not
for
the
money
it
would
bring
him
but
because
his
paunch
was
large
and
his
hand
trembled
in
the
morning
i
ve
been
drinking
he
said
and
i
want
to
work
hard
day
after
day
so
that
my
muscles
may
become
firm
and
sleep
come
to
me
at
the
old
man
thought
that
his
son
could
find
sam
a
place
he
s
a
driver
ed
is
he
said
laughing
and
he
won
t
pay
you
much
ed
don
t
let
go
of
money
he
s
a
tight
night
had
come
when
they
reached
the
town
where
ed
lived
and
the
three
men
walked
over
a
bridge
beneath
which
roared
a
waterfall
toward
the
long
main
street
of
the
town
and
ed
s
hotel
ed
a
young
man
with
a
dry
cigar
stuck
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
led
the
way
he
had
engaged
sam
standing
in
the
darkness
on
the
station
platform
accepting
his
story
without
comment
i
ll
let
you
carry
timbers
and
drive
nails
he
said
that
will
harden
you
on
the
way
over
the
bridge
he
talked
of
the
town
it
s
a
live
place
he
said
we
are
getting
people
in
look
at
that
he
exclaimed
chewing
at
the
cigar
and
pointing
to
the
waterfall
that
foamed
and
roared
almost
under
the
bridge
there
s
a
lot
of
power
there
and
where
there
s
power
there
will
be
a
at
ed
s
hotel
some
twenty
men
sat
about
a
long
low
office
they
were
for
the
most
part
working
men
and
sat
in
silence
reading
and
smoking
pipes
at
a
table
pushed
against
the
wall
a
young
man
with
a
scar
on
his
cheek
played
solitaire
with
a
greasy
pack
of
cards
and
in
front
of
him
and
sitting
in
a
chair
tilted
against
the
wall
a
boy
idly
watched
the
game
when
the
three
men
came
into
the
office
the
boy
dropped
his
chair
to
the
floor
and
stared
at
ed
who
stared
back
at
him
it
was
as
though
a
contest
of
some
sort
went
on
between
them
a
tall
woman
with
a
brisk
manner
and
pale
inexpressive
hard
blue
eyes
stood
back
of
a
little
combined
desk
and
cigar
case
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
as
the
three
walked
toward
her
she
looked
from
ed
to
the
boy
and
then
again
at
ed
sam
concluded
she
was
a
woman
bent
on
having
her
own
way
she
had
that
air
this
is
my
wife
said
ed
introducing
sam
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
passing
around
the
end
of
the
desk
to
stand
by
her
side
ed
s
wife
twirled
the
hotel
register
about
facing
sam
nodded
her
head
and
then
leaning
over
the
desk
bestowed
a
quick
kiss
upon
the
leathery
cheek
of
the
old
carpenter
sam
and
the
old
man
found
a
place
in
chairs
along
the
wall
and
sat
down
among
the
silent
men
the
old
man
pointed
to
the
boy
in
the
chair
beside
the
card
players
their
son
he
whispered
cautiously
the
boy
looked
at
his
mother
who
in
turn
looked
steadily
at
him
and
got
up
from
his
chair
back
of
the
desk
ed
talked
in
low
tones
to
his
wife
the
boy
stopping
before
sam
and
the
old
man
and
still
looking
toward
the
woman
put
out
his
hand
which
the
old
man
took
then
without
speaking
he
went
past
the
desk
and
through
a
doorway
and
began
noisily
climbing
a
flight
of
stairs
followed
by
his
mother
as
they
climbed
they
berated
each
other
their
voices
rising
to
a
high
pitch
and
echoing
through
the
upper
part
of
the
house
ed
coming
across
to
them
talked
to
sam
about
the
assignment
of
a
room
and
the
men
began
looking
at
the
stranger
noting
his
fine
clothes
their
eyes
filled
with
curiosity
selling
something
asked
a
large
young
man
rolling
a
quid
of
tobacco
in
his
mouth
no
replied
sam
shortly
going
to
work
for
the
silent
men
in
chairs
along
the
wall
dropped
their
newspapers
and
stared
and
the
young
man
at
the
table
sat
with
open
mouth
a
card
held
suspended
in
the
air
sam
had
become
for
the
moment
a
centre
of
interest
and
the
men
stirred
in
their
chairs
and
began
to
whisper
and
point
to
him
a
large
man
with
florid
cheeks
clad
in
a
long
overcoat
with
spots
down
the
front
came
in
at
the
door
and
passed
through
the
room
bowing
and
smiling
to
the
men
taking
ed
by
the
arm
he
disappeared
into
a
little
barroom
where
sam
could
hear
him
talking
in
low
tones
after
a
little
while
the
man
came
and
put
his
head
through
the
barroom
door
into
the
office
come
on
boys
he
said
smiling
and
nodding
right
and
left
the
drinks
are
on
the
men
got
up
and
filed
into
the
bar
the
old
man
and
sam
remaining
seated
in
their
chairs
they
began
talking
in
undertones
i
ll
start
em
thinking
these
men
said
the
old
man
from
his
pocket
he
took
a
pamphlet
and
gave
it
to
sam
it
was
a
crudely
written
attack
upon
rich
men
and
corporations
some
brains
in
the
fellow
who
wrote
that
said
the
old
carpenter
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
smiling
sam
did
not
think
so
he
sat
reading
it
and
listening
to
the
loud
boisterous
voices
of
the
men
in
the
barroom
the
man
was
explaining
the
details
of
a
proposed
town
bond
issue
sam
gathered
that
the
water
power
in
the
river
was
to
be
developed
we
want
to
make
this
a
live
town
said
the
voice
of
ed
earnestly
the
old
man
leaning
over
and
putting
his
hand
beside
his
mouth
began
whispering
to
sam
i
ll
bet
there
is
a
capitalist
deal
back
of
that
power
scheme
he
said
he
nodded
his
head
up
and
down
and
smiled
knowingly
if
there
is
ed
will
be
in
on
it
he
added
you
can
t
lose
ed
he
s
a
slick
he
took
the
pamphlet
from
sam
s
hand
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
i
m
a
socialist
he
explained
but
don
t
say
anything
ed
s
against
the
men
filed
back
into
the
room
each
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
the
man
followed
them
and
went
out
at
the
office
door
well
so
long
boys
he
shouted
heartily
ed
went
silently
up
the
stairs
to
join
the
mother
and
boy
whose
voices
could
still
be
heard
raised
in
outbursts
of
wrath
from
above
as
the
men
took
their
former
chairs
along
the
wall
well
bill
s
sure
all
right
said
the
young
man
evidently
expressing
the
opinion
of
the
men
in
regard
to
the
man
a
small
bent
old
man
with
sunken
cheeks
got
up
and
walking
across
the
room
leaned
against
the
cigar
case
did
you
ever
hear
this
one
he
asked
looking
about
obviously
no
answer
could
be
given
and
the
bent
old
man
launched
into
a
vile
pointless
anecdote
of
a
woman
a
miner
and
a
mule
the
crowd
giving
close
attention
and
laughing
uproariously
when
he
had
finished
the
socialist
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
joined
in
the
applause
that
was
a
good
one
eh
he
commented
turning
to
sam
sam
picking
up
his
bag
climbed
the
stairway
as
the
young
man
launched
into
another
tale
slightly
less
vile
in
his
room
to
which
ed
meeting
him
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
led
him
still
chewing
at
the
unlighted
cigar
he
turned
out
the
light
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
was
as
homesick
as
a
boy
truth
he
muttered
looking
through
the
window
to
the
street
do
these
men
seek
truth
the
next
day
he
went
to
work
wearing
a
suit
of
clothes
bought
from
ed
he
worked
with
ed
s
father
carrying
timbers
and
driving
nails
as
directed
by
him
in
the
gang
with
him
were
four
men
boarders
at
ed
s
hotel
and
four
other
men
who
lived
in
the
town
with
their
families
at
the
noon
hour
he
asked
the
old
carpenter
how
the
men
from
the
hotel
who
did
not
live
in
the
town
could
vote
on
the
question
of
the
power
bonds
the
old
man
grinned
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
i
don
t
know
he
said
i
suppose
ed
tends
to
that
he
s
a
slick
one
ed
at
work
the
men
who
had
been
so
silent
in
the
office
of
the
hotel
were
alert
and
wonderfully
busy
hurrying
here
and
there
at
a
word
from
the
old
man
and
sawing
and
nailing
furiously
they
seemed
bent
upon
outdoing
each
other
and
when
one
fell
behind
they
laughed
and
shouted
at
him
asking
him
if
he
had
decided
to
quit
for
the
day
but
though
they
seemed
determined
to
outdo
him
the
old
man
kept
ahead
of
them
all
his
hammer
beating
a
rattling
tattoo
upon
the
boards
all
day
at
the
noon
hour
he
had
given
each
of
the
men
one
of
the
pamphlets
from
his
pocket
and
on
the
way
back
to
his
hotel
in
the
evening
he
told
sam
that
the
others
had
tried
to
show
him
up
they
wanted
to
see
if
i
had
juice
in
me
he
explained
strutting
beside
sam
with
an
amusing
little
swagger
of
his
shoulders
sam
was
sick
with
fatigue
his
hands
were
blistered
his
legs
felt
weak
and
a
terrible
thirst
burned
in
his
throat
all
day
he
had
gone
grimly
ahead
thankful
for
every
physical
discomfort
every
throb
of
his
strained
tired
muscles
in
his
weariness
and
in
his
efforts
to
keep
pace
with
the
others
he
had
forgotten
colonel
tom
and
mary
underwood
all
during
that
month
and
into
the
next
sam
stayed
with
the
old
man
s
gang
he
ceased
thinking
and
only
worked
desperately
an
odd
feeling
of
loyalty
and
devotion
to
the
old
man
came
over
him
and
he
felt
that
he
too
must
prove
that
he
had
the
juice
in
him
at
the
hotel
he
went
to
bed
immediately
after
the
silent
dinner
slept
awoke
aching
and
went
to
work
again
one
sunday
one
of
the
men
of
his
gang
came
to
sam
s
room
and
invited
him
to
go
with
a
party
of
the
workers
into
the
country
they
went
in
boats
carrying
with
them
kegs
of
beer
to
a
deep
ravine
clothed
on
both
sides
by
heavy
woods
in
the
boat
with
sam
sat
the
young
man
who
was
called
jake
and
who
talked
loudly
of
the
time
they
would
have
in
the
woods
and
boasted
that
he
was
the
instigator
of
the
trip
i
thought
of
it
he
said
over
and
over
again
sam
wondered
why
he
had
been
invited
it
was
a
soft
october
day
and
in
the
ravine
he
sat
looking
at
the
trees
splashed
with
colour
and
breathing
deeply
of
the
air
his
whole
body
relaxed
grateful
for
the
day
of
rest
jake
came
and
sat
beside
him
what
are
you
he
asked
bluntly
we
know
you
are

sam
told
him
a

money

used
to
be

of
me

the
man
from
his
own
gang
who
had
invited
him
on
the
trip
came
up
to
them
bringing
sam
a
foaming
glass
of
beer
he
shook
his
head
the
doctor
says
it
will
not
do
he
explained
to
the
two
men
the
man
called
jake
began
talking
we
are
going
to
have
a
fight
with
ed
he
said
that
s
what
we
came
up
here
to
talk
about
we
want
to
know
where
you
stand
we
are
going
to
see
if
we
can
t
make
him
pay
as
well
for
the
work
here
as
men
are
paid
for
the
same
work
in
sam
lay
back
upon
the
grass
all
right
he
said
go
ahead
if
i
can
help
i
will
i
m
not
so
fond
of
the
men
began
talking
among
themselves
jake
standing
among
them
read
aloud
a
list
of
names
among
which
was
the
name
sam
had
written
on
the
register
at
ed
s
hotel
it
s
a
list
of
the
names
of
men
we
think
will
stick
together
and
vote
together
on
the
bond
issue
he
explained
turning
to
sam
ed
s
in
that
and
we
want
to
use
our
votes
to
scare
him
into
giving
us
what
we
want
will
you
stay
with
us
you
look
like
a
sam
nodded
and
getting
up
joined
the
men
about
the
beer
kegs
they
began
talking
of
ed
and
of
the
money
he
had
made
in
the
town
he
s
done
a
lot
of
town
work
here
and
there
s
been
graft
in
all
of
it
explained
jake
emphatically
it
s
time
he
was
being
made
to
do
the
right
while
they
talked
sam
sat
watching
the
men
s
faces
they
did
not
seem
vile
to
him
now
as
they
had
seemed
that
first
evening
in
the
hotel
office
he
began
thinking
of
them
silently
and
alertly
at
work
all
day
long
surrounded
by
such
influences
as
ed
and
bill
and
the
thought
sweetened
his
opinion
of
them
look
here
he
said
tell
me
of
this
matter
i
was
a
business
man
before
i
came
here
and
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
fellows
get
what
you
getting
up
jake
took
sam
s
arm
and
they
walked
down
the
ravine
jake
explaining
the
situation
in
the
town
the
game
he
said
is
to
make
the
taxpayers
pay
for
a
millrace
to
be
built
for
the
development
of
the
water
power
in
the
river
and
then
by
a
trick
to
turn
it
over
to
a
private
company
bill
and
ed
are
both
in
the
deal
and
they
are
working
for
a
chicago
man
named
crofts
he
s
been
up
here
at
the
hotel
with
bill
talking
to
ed
i
ve
figured
out
what
they
are
up
sam
sat
down
upon
a
log
and
laughed
heartily
crofts
eh
he
exclaimed
say
we
will
fight
this
thing
if
crofts
has
been
up
here
you
can
depend
upon
it
there
is
some
size
to
the
deal
we
will
just
smash
the
whole
crooked
gang
for
the
good
of
the
how
would
you
do
that
asked
jake
sam
sat
down
on
a
log
and
looked
at
the
river
flowing
past
the
mouth
of
the
ravine
just
fight
he
said
let
me
show
you
he
took
a
pencil
and
slip
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
with
the
voices
of
the
men
about
the
beer
kegs
in
his
ears
and
the
man
peering
over
his
shoulder
began
writing
his
first
political
pamphlet
he
wrote
and
erased
and
changed
words
and
phrases
the
pamphlet
was
a
statement
of
facts
as
to
the
value
of
water
power
and
was
addressed
to
the
taxpayers
of
the
community
he
warmed
to
the
subject
saying
that
a
fortune
lay
sleeping
in
the
river
and
that
the
town
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
discretion
now
could
build
with
that
fortune
a
beautiful
city
belonging
to
the
people
this
fortune
in
the
river
rightly
managed
will
pay
the
expenses
of
government
and
give
you
control
of
a
great
source
of
revenue
forever
he
wrote
build
your
millrace
but
look
out
for
a
trick
of
the
politicians
they
are
trying
to
steal
it
reject
the
offer
of
the
chicago
banker
named
crofts
demand
an
investigation
a
capitalist
has
been
found
who
will
take
the
water
power
bonds
at
four
per
cent
and
back
the
people
in
this
fight
for
a
free
american
across
the
head
of
the
pamphlet
sam
wrote
the
caption
a
river
paved
with
gold
and
handed
it
to
jake
who
read
it
and
whistled
softly
good
he
said
i
will
take
this
and
have
it
printed
it
will
make
bill
and
ed
sit
sam
took
a
bill
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
the
man
to
pay
for
the
printing
he
said
and
when
we
have
them
licked
i
am
the
man
who
will
take
the
four
per
cent
jake
scratched
his
head
how
much
do
you
suppose
the
deal
is
worth
to
crofts
a
million
or
he
would
not
bother
sam
answered
jake
folded
the
paper
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
this
would
make
bill
and
ed
squirm
eh
he
laughed
going
home
down
the
river
the
men
filled
with
beer
sang
and
shouted
as
the
boats
guided
by
sam
and
jake
floated
along
the
night
fell
warm
and
still
and
sam
thought
he
had
never
seen
the
sky
so
filled
with
stars
his
brain
was
busy
with
the
idea
of
doing
something
for
the
people
perhaps
here
in
this
town
i
shall
make
a
start
toward
what
i
am
after
he
thought
his
heart
filled
with
happiness
and
the
songs
of
the
tipsy
workmen
ringing
in
his
ears
all
through
the
next
few
weeks
there
was
an
air
of
something
astir
among
the
men
of
sam
s
gang
and
about
ed
s
hotel
during
the
evening
jake
went
among
the
men
talking
in
low
tones
and
once
he
took
a
three
days
vacation
telling
ed
that
he
did
not
feel
well
and
spending
the
time
among
the
men
employed
in
the
plough
works
up
the
river
from
time
to
time
he
came
to
sam
for
money
for
the
campaign
he
said
winking
and
hurrying
away
suddenly
a
speaker
appeared
and
began
talking
nightly
from
a
box
before
a
drug
store
on
main
street
and
after
dinner
the
office
of
ed
s
hotel
was
deserted
the
man
on
the
box
had
a
blackboard
hung
on
a
pole
on
which
he
drew
figures
estimating
the
value
of
the
power
in
the
river
and
as
he
talked
he
grew
more
and
more
excited
waving
his
arms
and
inveighing
against
certain
leasing
clauses
in
the
bond
proposal
he
declared
himself
a
follower
of
karl
marx
and
delighted
the
old
carpenter
who
danced
up
and
down
in
the
road
and
rubbed
his
hands
it
will
come
to
something
this
will
you
ll
see
he
declared
to
sam
one
day
ed
appeared
riding
in
a
buggy
at
the
job
where
sam
worked
and
called
the
old
man
into
the
road
he
sat
pounding
one
hand
upon
the
other
and
talking
in
a
low
voice
sam
thought
the
old
man
had
perhaps
been
indiscreet
in
the
distribution
of
the
socialistic
pamphlets
he
seemed
nervous
dancing
up
and
down
beside
the
buggy
and
shaking
his
head
then
hurrying
back
to
where
the
men
worked
he
pointed
over
his
shoulder
with
his
thumb
ed
wants
you
he
said
and
sam
noticed
that
his
voice
trembled
and
his
hand
shook
in
the
buggy
ed
and
sam
rode
in
silence
again
ed
chewed
at
an
unlighted
cigar
i
want
to
talk
with
you
he
had
said
as
sam
climbed
into
the
buggy
at
the
hotel
the
two
men
got
out
of
the
buggy
and
went
into
the
office
inside
the
door
ed
who
came
behind
sprang
forward
and
pinioned
sam
s
arms
with
his
own
he
was
as
powerful
as
a
bear
his
wife
the
tall
woman
with
the
inexpressive
eyes
came
running
into
the
room
her
face
drawn
with
hatred
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
broom
and
with
the
handle
of
this
she
struck
sam
several
swinging
blows
across
the
face
accompanying
each
blow
with
a
half
scream
of
rage
and
a
volley
of
vile
names
the
boy
alive
now
and
with
eyes
burning
with
zeal
came
running
down
the
stairs
and
pushed
the
woman
aside
he
struck
sam
time
after
time
in
the
face
with
his
fist
laughing
each
time
as
sam
winced
under
the
blows
sam
struggled
furiously
to
escape
ed
s
powerful
grasp
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
beaten
and
the
first
time
he
had
faced
hopeless
defeat
the
wrath
within
him
was
so
intense
that
the
jolting
impact
of
the
blows
seemed
a
secondary
matter
to
the
need
of
escaping
ed
s
grasp
suddenly
ed
turned
and
pushing
sam
before
him
threw
him
through
the
office
door
and
into
the
street
in
falling
his
head
struck
against
a
hitching
post
and
he
lay
stunned
when
he
partially
recovered
from
the
fall
sam
got
up
and
walked
along
the
street
his
face
was
swollen
and
bruised
and
his
nose
bled
the
street
was
deserted
and
the
assault
upon
him
had
been
unnoticed
he
went
to
a
hotel
on
main
street
a
more
pretentious
place
than
ed
s
near
the
bridge
leading
to
the
station
and
as
he
passed
in
he
saw
through
an
open
door
jake
the
man
leaning
against
the
bar
and
talking
to
bill
the
man
with
the
florid
face
sam
paying
for
a
room
went
upstairs
and
to
bed
in
the
bed
with
cold
bandages
on
his
bruised
face
he
tried
to
get
the
situation
in
hand
hatred
for
ed
ran
through
his
veins
his
hands
clenched
his
brain
whirled
and
the
brutal
passionate
faces
of
the
woman
and
the
boy
danced
before
his
eyes
i
ll
fix
them
the
brutal
bullies
he
muttered
aloud
and
then
the
thought
of
his
quest
came
back
to
his
mind
and
quieted
him
through
the
window
came
the
roar
of
the
waterfall
broken
by
noises
of
the
street
as
he
fell
asleep
they
mingled
with
his
dreams
sounding
soft
and
quiet
like
the
low
talk
of
a
family
about
the
fire
of
an
evening
he
was
awakened
by
a
noise
of
pounding
on
his
door
at
his
call
the
door
opened
and
the
face
of
the
old
carpenter
appeared
sam
laughed
and
sat
up
in
bed
already
the
cold
bandages
had
soothed
the
throbbing
of
his
bruised
face
go
away
begged
the
old
man
rubbing
his
hands
together
nervously
get
out
of
he
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
talked
in
a
hoarse
whisper
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
through
the
open
door
sam
getting
out
of
bed
began
filling
his
pipe
you
can
t
beat
ed
you
fellows
added
the
old
man
backing
out
at
the
door
he
s
a
slick
one
ed
is
you
better
get
out
of
sam
called
a
boy
and
gave
him
a
note
to
ed
asking
for
his
clothes
and
for
the
bag
in
his
room
and
to
the
boy
he
gave
a
large
bill
asking
him
to
pay
anything
due
when
the
boy
came
back
bringing
the
clothes
and
the
bag
he
returned
the
bill
unbroken
they
re
scared
about
something
up
there
he
said
looking
at
sam
s
bruised
face
sam
dressed
carefully
and
went
down
into
the
street
he
remembered
that
he
had
never
seen
a
printed
copy
of
the
political
pamphlet
written
in
the
ravine
and
realised
that
jake
had
used
it
to
make
money
for
himself
now
i
shall
try
something
else
he
thought
it
was
early
evening
and
crowds
of
men
coming
down
the
railroad
track
from
the
plough
works
turned
to
right
and
left
as
they
reached
main
street
sam
walked
among
them
climbing
a
little
hilly
side
street
to
a
number
he
had
got
from
a
clerk
at
the
drug
store
before
which
the
socialist
had
talked
he
stopped
at
a
little
frame
house
and
a
moment
after
knocking
was
in
the
presence
of
the
man
who
had
talked
night
after
night
from
the
box
in
the
street
sam
had
decided
to
see
what
could
be
done
through
him
the
socialist
was
a
short
fat
man
with
curly
grey
hair
shiny
round
cheeks
and
black
broken
teeth
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
looked
as
if
he
had
slept
in
his
clothes
a
corncob
pipe
lay
smoking
among
the
covers
of
the
bed
and
during
most
of
the
talk
he
sat
with
one
shoe
held
in
his
hand
as
though
about
to
put
it
on
about
the
room
in
orderly
piles
lay
stack
after
stack
of
books
sam
sat
down
in
a
chair
by
the
window
and
told
his
mission
it
is
a
big
thing
this
power
steal
that
is
going
on
here
he
explained
i
know
the
man
back
of
it
and
he
would
not
bother
with
a
small
affair
i
know
they
are
going
to
make
the
city
build
the
millrace
and
then
steal
it
it
will
be
a
big
thing
for
your
party
about
here
if
you
take
hold
and
stop
them
let
me
tell
you
how
it
can
be
he
explained
his
plan
and
told
of
crofts
and
of
his
wealth
and
dogged
bullying
determination
the
socialist
seemed
beside
himself
he
pulled
on
the
shoe
and
began
running
hurriedly
about
the
room
the
time
for
the
election
sam
went
on
is
almost
here
i
have
looked
into
this
thing
we
must
beat
this
bond
issue

then
put
through
a
square

of

seven
o
clock

fast

bottom

am
mcpherson
sam
mcpherson
of
the
socialist
ran
to
a
closet
and
began
pulling
on
his
coat
the
name
affected
him
so
that
his
hand
trembled
and
he
could
scarcely
get
his
arm
into
the
coat
sleeve
he
began
to
apologise
for
the
appearance
of
the
room
and
kept
looking
at
sam
with
the
air
of
one
not
able
to
believe
what
he
had
heard
as
the
two
men
walked
out
of
the
house
he
ran
ahead
holding
doors
open
for
sam
s
passage
and
you
will
help
us
mcpherson
he
exclaimed
you
a
man
of
millions
will
help
us
in
this
fight
sam
had
a
feeling
that
the
man
was
going
to
kiss
his
hand
or
do
something
equally
ridiculous
he
had
the
air
of
a
club
door
man
gone
off
his
head
at
the
hotel
sam
stood
in
the
lobby
while
the
fat
man
waited
in
a

offhand
mcpherson
he
had
explained
as
they
walked
along
the
street
when
the
socialist
came
out
of
the
booth
he
stood
before
sam
shaking
his
head
his
whole
attitude
had
changed
and
he
looked
like
a
man
caught
doing
a
foolish
or
absurd
thing
nothing
doing
nothing
doing
mcpherson
he
said
starting
for
the
hotel
door
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
shook
his
finger
at
sam
it
won
t
work
he
said
emphatically
chicago
is
too
sam
turned
and
went
back
to
his
room
his
name
had
killed
his
only
chance
to
beat
crofts
jake
bill
and
ed
in
his
room
he
sat
looking
out
of
the
window
into
the
street
where
shall
i
take
hold
now
he
asked
himself
turning
out
the
lights
he
sat
listening
to
the
roar
of
the
waterfall
and
thinking
of
the
events
of
the
last
week
i
have
had
a
time
he
thought
i
have
tried
something
and
even
though
it
did
not
work
it
has
been
the
best
fun
i
have
had
for
the
hours
slipped
away
and
night
came
on
he
could
hear
men
shouting
and
laughing
in
the
street
and
going
downstairs
he
stood
in
a
hallway
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
that
gathered
about
the
socialist
the
orator
shouted
and
waved
his
hand
he
seemed
as
proud
as
a
young
recruit
who
has
just
passed
through
his
first
baptism
of
fire
he
tried
to
make
a
fool
of
me
mcpherson
of
chicago
the
millionaire
one
of
the
capitalist
kings
he
tried
to
bribe
me
and
my
in
the
crowd
the
old
carpenter
was
dancing
in
the
road
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
with
the
feeling
of
a
man
who
had
finished
a
piece
of
work
or
turned
the
last
leaf
of
a
book
sam
went
back
to
his
hotel
in
the
morning
i
shall
be
on
my
way
he
thought
a
knock
came
at
the
door
and
the
man
came
in
he
closed
the
door
softly
and
winked
at
sam
ed
made
a
mistake
he
said
and
laughed
the
old
man
told
him
you
were
a
socialist
and
he
thought
you
were
trying
to
spoil
the
graft
he
is
scared
about
that
beating
you
got
and
mighty
sorry
he
s
all
right
ed
is
and
he
and
bill
and
i
have
got
the
votes

made
you
stay
under
cover
so
long
why
didn
t
you
tell
us
you
were
mcpherson
sam
saw
the
hopelessness
of
any
attempt
to
explain
jake
had
evidently
sold
out
the
men
sam
wondered
how
how
do
you
know
you
can
deliver
the
votes
he
asked
trying
to
lead
jake
on
jake
rolled
the
quid
in
his
mouth
and
winked
again
it
was
easy
enough
to
fix
the
men
when
ed
bill
and
i
got
together
he
said
you
know
about
the
other
there
s
a
clause
in
the
act
authorising
the
bond
issue
a
sleeper
bill
calls
it
you

more
about
that
than
i
do
anyway
the
power
will
be
turned
over
to
the
man
we
but
how
do
i
know
you
can
deliver
the
votes
jake
threw
out
his
hand
impatiently
what
do
they
know
he
asked
sharply
what
they
want
is
more
wages
there
s
a
million
in
the
power
deal
and
they
can
t
any
more
realise
a
million
than
they
can
tell
what
they
want
to
do
in
heaven
i
promised

fellows

city
scale

but

till

deal

sam
walked
over
and
held
open
the
door
good
night
he
said
jake
looked
annoyed
ain
t
you
even
going
to
make
a
bid
against
crofts
he
asked
we
ain
t
tied
to
him
if
you
do
better
by
us
i
m
in
this
thing
because
you
put
me

that
piece
you
wrote
up
the
river
scared
em
stiff
i
want
to
do
the
right
thing
by
you
don
t
be
sore
about
ed
he
wouldn
t
a
done
it
if
he
d
sam
shook
his
head
and
stood
with
his
hand
still
on
the
door
good
night
he
said
again
i
am
not
in
it
i
have
dropped
it
no
use
trying
to
chapter
ii
for
weeks
and
months
sam
led
a
wandering
vagabond
life
and
surely
a
stranger
or
more
restless
vagabond
never
went
upon
the
road
in
his
pocket
he
had
at
almost
any
time
from
one
to
five
thousand
dollars
his
bag
went
on
from
place
to
place
ahead
of
him
and
now
and
then
he
caught
up
with
it
unpacked
it
and
wore
a
suit
of
his
former
chicago
clothes
upon
the
streets
of
some
town
for
the
most
part
however
he
wore
the
rough
clothes
bought
from
ed
and
when
these
were
gone
others
like
them
with
a
warm
canvas
outer
jacket
and
for
rough
weather
a
pair
of
heavy
boots
lacing
half
way
up
the
legs
among
the
people
he
passed
for
a
rather
workman
with
money
in
his
pocket
going
his
own
way
during
all
those
months
of
wandering
and
even
when
he
had
returned
to
something
nearer
his
former
way
of
life
his
mind
was
unsettled
and
his
outlook
on
life
disturbed
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
among
all
men
was
a
unique
an
innovation
day
after
day
his
mind
ground
away
upon
his
problem
and
he
was
determined
to
seek
and
to
keep
on
seeking
until
he
found
for
himself
a
way
of
peace
in
the
towns
and
in
the
country
through
which
he
passed
he
saw
the
clerks
in
the
stores
the
merchants
with
worried
faces
hurrying
into
banks
the
farmers
brutalised
by
toil
dragging
their
weary
bodies
homeward
at
the
coming
of
night
and
told
himself
that
all
life
was
abortive
that
on
all
sides
of
him
it
wore
itself
out
in
little
futile
efforts
or
ran
away
in
side
currents
that
nowhere
did
it
move
steadily
continuously
forward
giving
point
to
the
tremendous
sacrifice
involved
in
just
living
and
working
in
the
world
he
thought
of
christ
going
about
seeing
the
world
and
talking
to
men
and
thought
that
he
too
would
go
and
talk
to
them
not
as
a
teacher
but
as
one
seeking
eagerly
to
be
taught
at
times
he
was
filled
with
longing
and
inexpressible
hopes
and
like
the
boy
of
caxton
would
get
out
of
bed
not
now
to
stand
in
miller
s
pasture
watching
the
rain
on
the
surface
of
the
water
but
to
walk
endless
miles
through
the
darkness
getting
the
blessed
relief
of
fatigue
into
his
body
and
often
paying
for
and
occupying
two
beds
in
one
night
sam
wanted
to
go
back
to
sue
he
wanted
peace
and
something
like
happiness
but
most
of
all
he
wanted
work
real
work
work
that
would
demand
of
him
day
after
day
the
best
and
finest
in
him
so
that
he
would
be
held
to
the
need
of
renewing
constantly
the
better
impulses
of
his
mind
he
was
at
the
top
of
his
life
and
the
few
weeks
of
hard
physical
exertion
as
a
driver
of
nails
and
a
bearer
of
timbers
had
begun
to
restore
his
body
to
shapeliness
and
strength
so
that
he
was
filled
anew
with
all
of
his
native
restlessness
and
energy
but
he
was
determined
that
he
would
not
again
pour
himself
out
in
work
that
would
react
upon
him
as
had
his
money
making
his
dream
of
beautiful
children
and
this
last
dream
of
a
kind
of
financial
fatherhood
to
the
illinois
town
the
incident
with
ed
and
the
man
had
been
his
first
serious
effort
at
anything
like
social
service
achieved
through
controlling
or
attempting
to
influence
the
public
mind
for
his
was
the
type
of
mind
that
runs
to
the
concrete
the
actual
as
he
sat
in
the
ravine
talking
to
jake
and
later
coming
home
in
the
boat
under
the
multitude
of
stars
he
had
looked
up
from
among
the
drunken
workmen
and
his
mind
had
seen
a
city
built
for
a
people
a
city
independent
beautiful
strong
and
free
but
a
glimpse
of
a
red
head
through
a
barroom
door
and
a
socialist
trembling
before
a
name
had
dispelled
the
vision
after
his
return
from
hearing
the
socialist
who
in
his
turn
was
hedged
about
by
complicated
influences
and
in
those
november
days
when
he
walked
south
through
illinois
seeing
the
late
glory
of
the
trees
and
breathing
the
fine
air
he
laughed
at
himself
for
having
had
the
vision
it
was
not
that
the
man
had
sold
him
out
it
was
not
the
beating
given
him
by
ed
s
son
or
the
blows
across
the
face
at
the
hands
of
his
vigorous
wife
it
was
just
that
at
bottom
he
did
not
believe
the
people
wanted
reform
they
wanted
a
ten
per
cent
raise
in
wages
the
public
mind
was
a
thing
too
big
too
complicated
and
inert
for
a
vision
or
an
ideal
to
get
at
and
move
deeply
and
then
walking
on
the
road
and
struggling
to
find
truth
even
within
himself
sam
had
to
come
to
something
else
at
bottom
he
was
no
leader
no
reformer
he
had
not
wanted
the
free
city
for
a
free
people
but
as
a
work
to
be
done
by
his
own
hand
he
was
mcpherson
the
money
maker
the
man
who
loved
himself
the
fact
not
the
sight
of
jake
hobnobbing
with
bill
or
the
timidity
of
the
socialist
had
blocked
his
way
to
work
as
a
political
reformer
and
builder
tramping
south
between
the
rows
of
shocked
corn
he
laughed
at
himself
the
experience
with
ed
and
jake
has
done
something
for
me
he
thought
they
bullied
me
i
have
been
a
kind
of
bully
myself
and
what
has
happened
has
been
good
medicine
for
sam
walked
the
roads
of
illinois
ohio
new
york
and
other
states
through
hill
country
and
flat
country
in
the
snow
drifts
of
winter
and
through
the
storms
of
spring
talking
to
people
asking
their
way
of
life
and
the
end
toward
which
they
worked
at
night
he
dreamed
of
sue
of
his
boyhood
struggles
in
caxton
of
janet
eberly
sitting
in
her
chair
and
talking
of
writers
of
books
or
visualising
the
stock
exchange
or
some
garish
drinking
place
he
saw
again
the
faces
of
crofts
webster
morrison
and
prince
intent
and
eager
as
he
laid
before
them
some
scheme
of
money
making
sometimes
at
night
he
awoke
seized
with
horror
seeing
colonel
tom
with
the
revolver
pressed
against
his
head
and
sitting
in
his
bed
and
all
through
the
next
day
he
talked
aloud
to
himself
the
damned
old
coward
he
shouted
into
the
darkness
of
his
room
or
into
the
wide
peaceful
prospect
of
the
countryside
the
idea
of
colonel
tom
as
a
suicide
seemed
unreal
grotesque
horrible
it
was
as
though
some
boy
had
done
the
thing
to
himself
the
man
had
been
so
boyishly
so
blusteringly
incompetent
so
completely
and
absolutely
without
bigness
and
purpose
and
yet
thought
sam
he
has
found
strength
to
whip
me
the
man
of
ability
he
has
taken
revenge
absolute
and
unanswerable
for
the
slight
i
put
upon
the
little
play
world
in
which
he
had
been
in
fancy
sam
could
see
the
great
paunch
and
the
little
white
pointed
beard
sticking
up
from
the
floor
in
the
room
where
the
colonel
lay
dead
and
into
his
mind
came
a
saying
a
sentence
the
distorted
remembrance
of
a
thought
he
had
got
from
a
book
of
janet
s
or
from
some
talk
he
had
heard
perhaps
at
his
own
dinner
table
it
is
horrible
to
see
a
fat
man
with
purple
veins
in
his
face
lying
at
such
times
he
hurried
along
the
road
like
one
pursued
people
driving
past
in
buggies
and
seeing
him
and
hearing
the
stream
of
talk
that
issued
from
his
lips
turned
and
watched
him
out
of
sight
and
sam
hurrying
and
seeking
relief
from
the
thoughts
in
his
mind
called
to
the
old
commonsense
instincts
within
himself
as
a
captain
marshals
his
forces
to
withstand
an
attack
i
will
find
work
i
will
find
work
i
will
seek
truth
he
said
sam
avoided
the
larger
towns
or
went
hurriedly
through
them
sleeping
night
after
night
at
village
hotels
or
at
some
hospitable
farmhouse
and
daily
he
increased
the
length
of
his
walks
getting
real
satisfaction
from
the
aching
of
his
legs
and
from
the
bruising
of
his
unaccustomed
feet
on
the
hard
road
like
jerome
he
had
a
wish
to
beat
upon
his
body
and
subdue
the
flesh
in
turn
he
was
blown
upon
by
the
wind
chilled
by
the
winter
frost
wet
by
the
rains
and
warmed
by
the
sun
in
the
spring
he
swam
in
rivers
lay
on
sheltered
hillsides
watching
the
cattle
grazing
in
the
fields
and
the
white
clouds
floating
across
the
sky
and
constantly
his
legs
became
harder
and
his
body
more
flat
and
sinewy
once
he
slept
for
a
night
in
a
straw
stack
at
the
edge
of
a
woods
and
in
the
morning
was
awakened
by
a
farmer
s
dog
licking
his
face
several
times
he
came
up
to
vagabonds
umbrella
menders
and
other
roadsters
and
walked
with
them
but
he
found
in
their
society
no
incentive
to
join
in
their
flights
across
country
on
freight
trains
or
on
the
fronts
of
passenger
trains
those
whom
he
met
and
with
whom
he
talked
and
walked
did
not
interest
him
greatly
they
had
no
end
in
life
sought
no
ideal
of
usefulness
walking
and
talking
with
them
the
romance
went
out
of
their
wandering
life
they
were
utterly
dull
and
stupid
they
were
almost
without
exception
strikingly
unclean
they
wanted
passionately
to
get
drunk
and
they
seemed
to
be
forever
avoiding
life
with
its
problems
and
responsibilities
they
always
talked
of
the
big
cities
of
chi
and
cinci
and
frisco
and
were
bent
upon
getting
to
one
of
these
places
they
condemned
the
rich
and
begged
and
stole
from
the
poor
talked
swaggeringly
of
their
personal
courage
and
ran
whimpering
and
begging
before
country
constables
one
of
them
a
tall
leering
youth
in
a
grey
cap
who
came
up
to
sam
one
evening
at
the
edge
of
a
village
in
indiana
tried
to
rob
him
full
of
his
new
strength
and
with
the
thought
of
ed
s
wife
and
the
son
in
his
mind
sam
sprang
upon
him
and
had
revenge
for
the
beating
received
in
the
office
of
ed
s
hotel
by
beating
this
fellow
in
his
turn
when
the
tall
youth
had
partially
recovered
from
the
beating
and
had
staggered
to
his
feet
he
ran
off
into
the
darkness
stopping
when
well
out
of
reach
to
hurl
a
stone
that
splashed
in
the
mud
of
the
road
at
sam
s
feet
everywhere
sam
sought
people
who
would
talk
to
him
of
themselves
he
had
a
kind
of
faith
that
a
message
would
come
to
him
out
of
the
mouth
of
some
simple
homely
dweller
of
the
villages
or
the
farms
a
woman
with
whom
he
talked
in
the
railroad
station
at
fort
wayne
indiana
interested
him
so
that
he
went
into
a
train
with
her
and
travelled
all
night
in
the
day
coach
listening
to
her
talk
of
her
three
sons
one
of
whom
had
weak
lungs
and
had
with
two
younger
brothers
taken
up
government
land
in
the
west
the
woman
had
been
with
them
for
some
months
helping
them
to
get
a
start
i
was
raised
on
a
farm
and
knew
things
they
could
not
know
she
told
sam
raising
her
voice
above
the
rumble
of
the
train
and
the
snoring
of
fellow
passengers
she
had
worked
with
her
sons
in
the
field
ploughing
and
planting
had
driven
a
team
across
country
carrying
boards
for
the
building
of
a
house
and
had
grown
brown
and
strong
at
the
work
and

well
his
arms
are
as
brown
as
my
own
and
he
has
gained
eleven
pounds
she
said
rolling
up
her
sleeves
and
showing
her
heavy
muscular
forearms
she
planned
to
take
her
husband
a
machinist
working
in
a
bicycle
factory
in
buffalo
and
her
two
grown
daughters
clerks
in
a
drygoods
store
with
her
and
return
to
the
new
country
and
having
a
sense
of
her
hearer
s
interest
in
her
story
she
talked
of
the
bigness
of
the
west
and
the
loneliness
of
the
vast
silent
plains
saying
that
they
sometimes
made
her
heart
ache
sam
thought
she
had
in
some
way
achieved
success
although
he
did
not
see
how
her
experience
could
serve
as
a
guide
to
him
you
have
got
somewhere
you
have
got
hold
of
a
truth
he
said
taking
her
hand
when
he
got
off
the
train
at
cleveland
at
dawn
at
another
time
in
the
late
spring
when
he
was
tramping
through
southern
ohio
a
man
drove
up
beside
him
and
pulling
in
his
horse
asked
where
are
you
going
adding
genially
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
a
sam
looked
at
him
and
smiled
something
in
the
man
s
manner
or
in
his
dress
suggesting
the
man
of
god
he
assumed
a
bantering
air
i
am
on
my
way
to
the
new
jerusalem
he
said
seriously
i
am
one
who
seeks
the
young
minister
picked
up
his
reins
with
a
look
of
alarm
but
when
he
saw
a
smile
playing
about
the
corners
of
sam
s
mouth
he
turned
the
wheels
of
his
buggy
get
in
and
come
along
with
me
and
we
will
talk
of
the
new
jerusalem
he
said
on
the
impulse
sam
got
into
the
buggy
and
driving
along
the
dusty
road
told
the
essential
parts
of
his
story
and
of
his
quest
for
an
end
toward
which
he
might
work
it
would
be
simple
enough
if
i
were
without
money
and
driven
by
hard
necessity
but
i
am
not
i
want
work
not
because
it
is
work
and
will
bring
me
bread
and
butter
but
because
i
need
to
be
doing
something
that
will
satisfy
me
when
i
am
done
i
do
not
want
so
much
to
serve
men
as
to
serve
myself
i
want
to
get
at
happiness
and
usefulness
as
for
years
i
got
at
money
making
there
is
a
right
way
of
life
for
such
a
man
as
me
and
i
want
to
find
that
the
young
minister
who
was
a
graduate
of
a
lutheran
seminary
at
springfield
ohio
and
had
come
out
of
college
with
a
very
serious
outlook
on
life
took
sam
to
his
house
and
together
they
sat
talking
half
the
night
he
had
a
wife
a
country
girl
with
a
babe
lying
at
her
breast
who
got
supper
for
them
and
who
after
supper
sat
in
the
shadows
in
a
corner
of
the
listening
to
their
talk
the
two
men
sat
together
sam
smoked
his
pipe
and
the
minister
poked
at
a
coal
fire
that
burned
in
a
stove
they
talked
of
god
and
of
what
the
thought
of
god
meant
to
men
but
the
young
minister
did
not
try
to
give
sam
an
answer
to
his
problem
on
the
contrary
sam
found
him
strikingly
dissatisfied
and
unhappy
in
his
way
of
life
there
is
no
spirit
of
god
here
he
said
poking
viciously
at
the
coals
in
the
stove
the
people
here
do
not
want
me
to
talk
to
them
of
god
they
have
no
curiosity
about
what
he
wants
of
them
nor
of
why
he
has
put
them
here
they
want
me
to
tell
them
of
a
city
in
the
sky
a
kind
of
glorified
dayton
ohio
to
which
they
can
go
when
they
have
finished
this
life
of
work
and
of
putting
money
in
the
savings
for
several
days
sam
stayed
with
the
clergyman
driving
about
the
country
with
him
and
talking
of
god
in
the
evening
they
sat
in
the
house
continuing
their
talks
and
on
sunday
sam
went
to
hear
the
man
preach
in
his
church
the
sermon
was
a
disappointment
to
sam
although
his
host
had
talked
vigorously
and
well
in
private
his
public
address
was
stilted
and
unnatural
the
man
thought
sam
has
no
feeling
for
public
address
and
is
not
treating
his
people
well
in
not
giving
them
without
reservation
the
ideas
he
has
expounded
to
me
in
his
he
decided
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
the
people
who
sat
patiently
listening
week
after
week
and
who
gave
the
man
the
means
of
a
living
for
so
lame
an
effort
one
evening
when
sam
had
been
with
them
for
a
week
the
young
wife
came
to
him
as
he
stood
on
the
little
porch
before
the
house
i
wish
you
would
go
away
she
said
standing
with
her
babe
in
her
arms
and
looking
at
the
porch
floor
you
stir
him
up
and
make
him
sam
stepped
off
the
porch
and
hurried
off
up
the
road
into
the
darkness
there
had
been
tears
in
the
wife
s
eyes
in
june
he
went
with
a
threshing
crew
working
among
labourers
and
eating
with
them
in
the
fields
or
about
the
crowded
tables
of
farmhouses
where
they
stopped
to
thresh
each
day
sam
and
the
men
with
him
worked
in
a
new
place
and
had
as
helpers
the
farmer
for
whom
they
threshed
and
several
of
his
neighbours
the
farmers
worked
at
a
killing
pace
and
the
men
of
the
threshing
crew
were
expected
to
keep
abreast
of
each
new
lot
of
them
day
after
day
at
night
the
threshermen
too
weary
for
talk
crept
into
the
loft
of
a
barn
slept
until
daylight
and
then
began
another
day
of
heartbreaking
toil
on
sunday
morning
they
went
for
a
swim
in
some
creek
and
in
the
afternoon
sat
in
a
barn
or
under
the
trees
of
an
orchard
sleeping
or
indulging
in
detached
fragmentary
bits
of
talk
talk
that
never
rose
above
a
low
wearisome
level
for
hours
they
would
try
to
settle
a
dispute
as
to
whether
a
horse
they
had
seen
at
some
farm
during
the
week
had
three
or
four
white
feet
and
one
man
in
the
crew
never
talked
at
all
sitting
on
his
heels
through
the
long
sunday
afternoons
and
whittling
at
a
stick
with
his
pocket
knife
the
threshing
outfit
with
which
sam
worked
was
owned
by
a
man
named
joe
who
was
in
debt
for
it
to
the
maker
and
who
after
working
with
the
men
all
day
drove
about
the
country
half
the
night
making
deals
with
farmers
for
other
days
of
threshing
sam
thought
that
he
looked
constantly
on
the
point
of
collapse
through
overwork
and
worry
and
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
with
joe
through
several
seasons
told
sam
that
at
the
end
of
the
season
their
employer
did
not
have
enough
money
left
from
his
season
of
work
to
pay
the
interest
on
the
debt
for
his
machines
and
that
he
continually
took
jobs
for
less
than
the
cost
of
doing
them
one
has
to
keep
going
said
joe
when
one
day
sam
began
talking
to
him
on
the
matter
when
told
to
keep
sam
s
wage
until
the
end
of
the
season
he
looked
relieved
and
at
the
end
of
the
season
came
to
sam
looking
more
worried
and
said
that
he
had
no
money
i
will
give
you
a
note
bearing
good
interest
if
you
can
let
me
have
a
little
time
he
said
sam
took
the
note
and
looked
at
the
pale
drawn
face
peering
out
of
him
from
the
shadows
at
the
back
of
the
barn
why
do
you
not
drop
the
whole
thing
and
begin
working
for
some
one
else
he
asked
joe
looked
indignant
a
man
wants
independence
he
said
when
sam
got
again
upon
the
road
he
stopped
at
a
little
bridge
over
a
stream
and
tearing
up
joe
s
note
watched
the
torn
pieces
of
it
float
away
upon
the
brown
water
chapter
iii
through
the
summer
and
early
fall
sam
continued
his
wanderings
the
days
on
which
something
happened
or
on
which
something
outside
himself
interested
or
attracted
him
were
special
days
giving
him
food
for
hours
of
thought
but
for
the
most
part
he
walked
on
and
on
for
weeks
sunk
in
a
kind
of
healing
lethargy
of
physical
fatigue
always
he
tried
to
get
at
people
who
came
into
his
way
and
to
discover
something
of
their
way
of
life
and
the
end
toward
which
they
worked
and
many
an
staring
man
and
woman
he
left
behind
him
on
the
road
and
on
the
sidewalks
of
the
villages
he
had
one
principle
of
action
whenever
an
idea
came
into
his
mind
he
did
not
hesitate
but
began
trying
at
once
the
practicability
of
living
by
following
the
idea
and
although
the
practice
brought
him
to
no
end
and
only
seemed
to
multiply
the
difficulties
of
the
problem
he
was
striving
to
work
out
it
brought
him
many
strange
experiences
at
one
time
he
was
for
several
days
a
bartender
in
a
saloon
in
a
town
in
eastern
ohio
the
saloon
was
in
a
small
wooden
building
facing
a
railroad
track
and
sam
had
gone
in
there
with
a
labourer
met
on
the
sidewalk
it
was
a
stormy
night
in
september
at
the
end
of
his
first
year
of
wandering
and
while
he
stood
by
a
roaring
coal
stove
after
buying
drinks
for
the
labourer
and
cigars
for
himself
several
men
came
in
and
stood
by
the
bar
drinking
together
as
they
drank
they
became
more
and
more
friendly
slapping
each
other
on
the
back
singing
songs
and
boasting
one
of
them
got
out
upon
the
floor
and
danced
a
jig
the
proprietor
a
man
with
one
dead
eye
who
had
himself
been
drinking
freely
put
a
bottle
upon
the
bar
and
coming
up
to
sam
began
complaining
that
he
had
no
bartender
and
had
to
work
long
hours
drink
what
you
want
boys
and
then
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
owe
he
said
to
the
men
standing
along
the
bar
watching
the
men
who
drank
and
played
like
school
boys
about
the
room
and
looking
at
the
bottle
sitting
on
the
bar
the
contents
of
which
had
for
the
moment
taken
the
sombre
dulness
out
of
the
lives
of
the
workmen
sam
said
to
himself
i
will
take
up
this
trade
it
may
appeal
to
me
at
least
i
shall
be
selling
forgetfulness
and
not
be
wasting
my
life
with
this
tramping
on
the
road
and
the
saloon
in
which
he
worked
was
a
profitable
one
and
although
in
an
obscure
place
had
made
its
proprietor
what
is
called
well
it
had
a
side
door
opening
into
an
alley
and
one
went
up
this
alley
to
the
main
street
of
the
town
the
front
door
looking
upon
the
railroad
tracks
was
but
little
used
perhaps
at
the
noon
hour
two
or
three
young
men
from
the
freight
depot
down
the
tracks
would
come
in
by
it
and
stand
about
drinking
beer
but
the
trade
that
came
down
the
alley
and
in
at
the
side
door
was
prodigious
all
day
long
men
hurried
in
at
this
door
took
drinks
and
hurried
out
again
looking
up
the
alley
and
running
quickly
when
they
found
the
way
clear
these
men
all
drank
whiskey
and
when
sam
had
worked
for
a
few
days
in
the
place
he
once
made
the
mistake
of
reaching
for
the
bottle
when
he
heard
the
door
open
let
them
ask
for
it
said
the
proprietor
gruffly
do
you
want
to
insult
a
man
on
saturday
the
place
was
filled
all
day
with
farmers
and
at
odd
hours
on
other
days
men
came
in
whimpering
and
begging
drinks
when
alone
in
the
place
sam
looked
at
the
trembling
fingers
of
these
men
and
put
the
bottle
before
them
saying
drink
all
you
want
of
the
when
the
proprietor
was
in
the
men
who
begged
drinks
stood
a
moment
by
the
stove
and
then
went
out
thrusting
their
hands
into
their
coat
pockets
and
looking
at
the
floor
bar
flies
the
proprietor
explained
laconically
the
whiskey
was
horrible
the
proprietor
mixed
it
himself
and
put
it
into
stone
jars
that
stood
under
the
bar
pouring
it
out
of
these
into
bottles
as
they
became
empty
he
kept
on
display
in
glass
cases
bottles
of
well
known
brands
of
whiskey
but
when
a
man
came
in
and
asked
for
one
of
these
brands
sam
handed
him
a
bottle
bearing
that
label
from
beneath
the
bar
a
bottle
previously
filled
by
al
from
the
jugs
of
his
own
mixture
as
al
sold
no
mixed
drinks
sam
was
compelled
to
know
nothing
the
bartender
s
art
and
stood
all
day
handing
out
al
s
poisonous
stuff
and
the
foaming
glasses
of
beer
the
workingmen
drank
in
the
evening
of
the
men
coming
in
at
the
side
door
a
shoe
merchant
a
grocer
the
proprietor
of
a
restaurant
and
a
telegraph
operator
interested
sam
most
several
times
each
day
these
men
would
appear
glance
back
over
their
shoulders
at
the
door
and
then
turning
to
the
bar
would
look
at
sam
apologetically
give
me
a
little
out
of
the
bottle
i
have
a
bad
cold
they
would
say
as
though
repeating
a
formula
at
the
end
of
the
week
sam
was
on
the
road
again
the
rather
bizarre
notion
that
by
staying
there
he
would
be
selling
forgetfulness
of
life
s
unhappiness
had
been
dispelled
during
his
first
day
s
duty
and
his
curiosity
concerning
the
customers
was
his
undoing
as
the
men
came
in
at
the
side
door
and
stood
before
him
sam
leaned
over
the
bar
and
asked
them
why
they
drank
some
of
the
men
laughed
some
swore
at
him
and
the
telegraph
operator
reported
the
matter
to
al
calling
sam
s
question
an
impertinence
you
fool
don
t
you
know
better
than
to
be
throwing
stones
at
the
bar
al
roared
and
with
an
oath
discharged
him
chapter
iv
one
fine
warm
morning
in
the
fall
sam
was
sitting
in
a
little
park
in
the
centre
of
a
pennsylvania
manufacturing
town
watching
men
and
women
going
through
the
quiet
streets
to
the
factories
and
striving
to
overcome
a
feeling
of
depression
aroused
by
an
experience
of
the
evening
before
he
had
come
into
town
over
a
poorly
made
clay
road
running
through
barren
hills
and
depressed
and
weary
had
stood
on
the
shores
of
a
river
swollen
by
the
early
fall
rains
that
flowed
along
the
edges
of
the
town
before
him
in
the
distance
he
had
looked
into
the
windows
of
a
huge
factory
the
black
smoke
from
which
added
to
the
gloom
of
the
scene
that
lay
before
him
through
the
windows
of
the
factory
dimly
seen
workers
ran
here
and
there
appearing
and
disappearing
the
glare
of
the
furnace
fire
lighting
now
one
now
another
of
them
sharply
at
his
feet
the
tumbling
waters
that
rolled
and
pitched
over
a
little
dam
fascinated
him
looking
closely
at
the
racing
waters
his
head
light
from
physical
weariness
reeled
and
in
fear
of
falling
he
had
been
compelled
to
grip
firmly
the
small
tree
against
which
he
leaned
in
the
back
yard
of
a
house
across
the
stream
from
sam
and
facing
the
factory
four
guinea
hens
sat
on
a
board
fence
their
weird
plaintive
cries
making
a
peculiarly
fitting
accompaniment
to
the
scene
that
lay
before
him
and
in
the
yard
itself
two
bedraggled
fowls
fought
each
other
again
and
again
they
sprang
into
the
fray
striking
out
with
bills
and
spurs
becoming
exhausted
they
fell
to
picking
and
scratching
among
the
rubbish
in
the
yard
and
when
they
had
a
little
recovered
renewed
the
struggle
for
an
hour
sam
had
looked
at
the
scene
letting
his
eyes
wander
from
the
river
to
the
grey
sky
and
to
the
factory
belching
forth
its
black
smoke
he
had
thought
that
the
two
feebly
struggling
fowls
immersed
in
their
pointless
struggle
in
the
midst
of
such
mighty
force
epitomised
much
of
man
s
struggle
in
the
world
and
turning
had
gone
along
the
sidewalks
and
to
the
village
hotel
feeling
old
and
tired
now
on
the
bench
in
the
little
park
with
the
early
morning
sun
shining
down
through
the
glistening
rain
drops
clinging
to
the
red
leaves
of
the
trees
he
began
to
lose
the
sense
of
depression
that
had
clung
to
him
through
the
night
a
young
man
who
walked
in
the
park
saw
him
idly
watching
the
hurrying
workers
and
stopped
to
sit
beside
him
on
the
road
brother
he
asked
sam
shook
his
head
and
the
other
began
talking
fools
and
slaves
he
said
earnestly
pointing
to
the
men
and
women
passing
on
the
sidewalk
see
them
going
like
beasts
to
their
bondage
what
do
they
get
for
it
what
kind
of
lives
do
they
lead
the
lives
of
he
looked
at
sam
for
approval
of
the
sentiment
he
had
voiced
we
are
all
fools
and
slaves
said
sam
stoutly
jumping
to
his
feet
the
young
man
began
waving
his
arms
about
there
you
talk
sense
he
cried
welcome
to
our
town
stranger
we
have
no
thinkers
here
the
workers
are
like
dogs
there
is
no
solidarity
among
them
come
and
have
breakfast
with
in
the
restaurant
the
young
man
began
talking
of
himself
he
was
a
graduate
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
his
father
had
died
while
he
was
yet
in
school
and
had
left
him
a
modest
fortune
upon
the
income
of
which
he
lived
with
his
mother
he
did
no
work
and
was
enormously
proud
of
the
fact
i
refuse
to
work
i
scorn
it
he
declared
shaking
a
breakfast
roll
in
the
air
since
leaving
school
he
had
devoted
himself
to
the
cause
of
the
socialist
party
in
his
native
town
and
boasted
of
the
leadership
he
had
already
achieved
his
mother
he
declared
was
disturbed
and
worried
because
of
his
connection
with
the
movement
she
wants
me
to
be
respectable
he
said
sadly
and
added
what
s
the
use
trying
to
explain
to
a
woman
i
can
t
get
her
to
see
the
difference
between
a
socialist
and
a
anarchist
and
i
ve
given
up
trying
she
expects
me
to
end
by
blowing
somebody
up
with
dynamite
or
by
getting
into
jail
for
throwing
bricks
at
the
borough
he
talked
of
a
strike
going
on
among
some
girl
employés
of
a
jewish
shirtwaist
factory
in
the
town
and
sam
immediately
interested
began
asking
questions
and
after
breakfast
went
with
his
new
acquaintance
to
the
scene
of
the
strike
the
shirtwaist
factory
was
located
in
a
loft
above
a
grocery
store
and
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
store
three
girl
pickets
were
walking
up
and
down
a
flashily
dressed
hebrew
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
stood
in
the
stairway
leading
to
the
loft
and
looked
closely
at
the
young
socialist
and
sam
from
his
lips
came
a
stream
of
vile
words
which
he
pretended
to
be
addressing
to
the
empty
air
when
sam
walked
towards
him
he
turned
and
ran
up
the
stairs
shouting
oaths
over
his
shoulder
sam
joined
the
three
girls
and
began
talking
to
them
walking
up
and
down
with
them
before
the
grocery
store
what
are
you
doing
to
win
he
asked
when
they
had
told
him
of
their
grievances
we
do
what
we
can
said
a
jewish
girl
with
broad
hips
great
motherly
breasts
and
fine
soft
brown
eyes
who
appeared
to
be
a
leader
and
spokesman
among
the
strikers
we
walk
up
and
down
here
and
try
to
get
a
word
with
the
strikebreakers
the
boss
has
brought
in
from
other
towns
when
they
go
in
and
come
frank
the
university
man
spoke
up
we
are
putting
up
stickers
everywhere
he
said
i
myself
have
put
up
hundreds
of
he
took
from
his
coat
pocket
a
printed
slip
gummed
on
one
side
and
told
sam
that
he
had
been
putting
them
on
walls
and
telegraph
poles
about
town
the
thing
was
vilely
written
down
with
the
dirty
scabs
was
the
heading
in
bold
black
letters
across
the
top
sam
was
shocked
at
the
vileness
of
the
caption
and
at
the
crude
brutality
of
the
text
printed
on
the
slip
do
you
call
women
workers
names
like
that
he
asked
they
have
taken
our
work
from
us
the
jewish
girl
answered
simply
and
began
again
telling
the
story
of
her
sister
strikers
and
of
what
the
low
wage
had
meant
to
them
and
to
their
families
to
me
it
does
not
so
much
matter
i
have
a
brother
who
works
in
a
clothing
store
and
he
can
support
me
but
many
of
the
women
in
our
union
have
only
their
wage
here
with
which
to
feed
their
sam
s
mind
began
working
on
the
problem
here
he
declared
is
something
definite
to
do
a
battle
in
which
i
will
pit
myself
against
this
employer
for
the
sake
of
these
he
put
away
from
him
his
experience
in
the
illinois
town
telling
himself
that
the
young
woman
walking
beside
him
would
have
a
sense
of
honour
unknown
to
the
young
workman
who
had
sold
him
out
to
bill
and
ed
i
failed
with
my
money
he
thought
now
i
will
try
to
help
these
girls
with
my
turning
to
the
jewish
girl
he
made
a
quick
decision
i
will
help
you
get
your
places
back
he
said
leaving
the
girls
he
went
across
the
street
to
a
barber
shop
where
he
could
watch
the
entrance
to
the
factory
he
wanted
to
think
out
a
method
of
procedure
and
wanted
also
to
look
at
the
girl
strikebreakers
as
they
came
to
work
after
a
time
several
girls
came
along
the
street
and
turned
in
at
the
stairway
the
flashily
dressed
hebrew
with
the
cigar
still
in
his
mouth
was
again
by
the
stairway
entrance
the
three
pickets
running
forward
accosted
the
file
of
girls
going
up
the
stairs
one
of
whom
a
young
american
girl
with
yellow
hair
turned
and
shouted
something
over
her
shoulder
the
man
called
frank
shouted
back
and
the
hebrew
took
the
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
and
laughed
heartily
sam
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
a
dozen
plans
for
helping
the
striking
girls
running
through
his
mind
during
the
morning
he
went
into
the
grocery
store
on
the
corner
a
saloon
in
the
neighbourhood
and
returned
to
the
barber
shop
talking
to
men
of
the
strike
he
ate
his
lunch
alone
still
thinking
of
the
three
girls
patiently
walking
up
and
down
before
the
stairway
their
ceaseless
walking
seemed
to
him
a
useless
waste
of
energy
they
should
be
doing
something
more
definite
he
thought
after
lunch
he
joined
the
jewish
girl
and
together
they
walked
along
the
street
talking
of
the
strike
you
can
not
win
this
strike
by
just
calling
nasty
names
he
said
i
do
not
like
that
dirty
scab
sticker
frank
had
in
his
pocket
it
can
not
help
you
and
only
antagonises
the
girls
who
have
taken
your
places
here
in
this
part
of
town
the
people
want
to
see
you
win
i
have
talked
to
the
men
who
come
into
the
saloon
and
the
barber
shop
across
the
street
and
you
already
have
their
sympathy
you
want
to
get
the
sympathy
of
the
girls
who
have
taken
your
places
calling
them
dirty
scabs
only
makes
martyrs
of
them
did
the
girl
call
you
a
name
this
morning
the
jewish
girl
looked
at
sam
and
laughed
bitterly
rather
she
called
me
a
street
they
continued
their
walk
along
the
street
across
the
railroad
track
and
a
bridge
and
into
a
quiet
residence
street
carriages
stood
at
the
curb
before
the
houses
and
pointing
to
these
and
to
the
houses
sam
said
men
have
bought
these
things
for
their
a
shadow
fell
across
the
girl
s
face
i
suppose
all
of
us
want
what
these
women
have
she
answered
we
do
not
really
want
to
fight
and
to
stand
on
our
own
feet
not
when
we
know
the
world
what
a
woman
really
wants
is
a
man
she
added
shortly
sam
began
talking
and
told
her
of
a
plan
that
had
come
into
his
mind
he
had
remembered
how
jack
prince
and
morrison
used
to
talk
about
the
appeal
of
the
direct
personal
letter
and
how
effectively
it
was
used
by
mail
order
houses
we
will
have
a
mail
order
strike
here
he
said
and
went
on
to
lay
before
her
the
details
of
his
plan
he
proposed
that
she
frank
and
some
others
of
the
striking
girls
should
go
about
town
getting
the
names
and
the
mail
addresses
of
the
girl
strikebreakers
get
also
the
names
of
the
keepers
of
the
boarding
houses
at
which
these
girls
live
and
the
names
of
the
men
and
women
who
live
in
the
same
houses
he
suggested
then
you
get
the
striking
girls
and
women
together
and
have
them
tell
me
their
stories
we
will
write
letters
day
after
day
to
the
girl
strikebreakers
to
the
women
who
keep
the
boarding
houses
and
to
the
people
who
live
in
the
houses
and
sit
at
table
with
them
we
won
t
call
names
we
will
tell
the
story
of
what
being
beaten
in
this
fight
means
to
the
women
in
your
union
tell
it
simply
and
truthfully
as
you
told
it
to
me
this
it
will
cost
such
a
lot
said
the
jewish
girl
shaking
her
head
sam
took
a
roll
of
bills
from
his
pocket
and
showed
it
to
her
i
will
pay
he
said
why
she
asked
looking
at
him
sharply
because
i
am
a
man
wanting
work
just
as
you
want
work
he
replied
and
then
went
on
hurriedly
it
is
a
long
story
i
am
a
rich
man
wandering
about
the
world
seeking
truth
i
will
not
want
that
known
take
me
for
granted
you
won
t
be
within
an
hour
he
had
engaged
a
large
room
paying
a
month
s
rent
in
advance
and
into
the
room
chairs
and
table
and
typewriters
had
been
brought
he
put
an
advertisement
in
the
evening
paper
for
girl
stenographers
and
a
printer
hurried
by
a
promise
of
extra
pay
ran
out
for
him
several
thousand
letter
heads
across
the
top
of
which
in
bold
black
type
ran
the
words
the
girl
that
night
sam
held
in
the
room
he
had
engaged
a
meeting
of
the
girl
strikers
explaining
to
them
his
plan
and
offering
to
pay
all
expenses
of
the
fight
he
proposed
to
make
for
them
they
clapped
their
hands
and
shouted
approvingly
and
sam
began
laying
out
his
campaign
one
of
the
girls
he
told
off
to
stand
in
front
of
the
factory
morning
and
evening
i
will
have
other
help
for
you
there
he
said
before
you
go
home
there
will
be
a
printer
here
with
a
bundle
of
pamphlets
i
am
having
printed
for
advised
by
the
jewish
girl
he
told
off
others
to
get
additional
names
for
the
mailing
list
he
wanted
getting
many
important
ones
from
girls
in
the
room
six
of
the
girls
he
asked
to
come
in
the
morning
to
help
him
with
addressing
and
mailing
letters
the
jewish
girl
he
told
to
take
charge
of
the
girls
at
work
in
the
room
on
the
morrow
to
become
also
an
office
and
to
superintend
getting
the
names
frank
rose
at
the
back
of
the
room
who
are
you
anyway
he
asked
a
man
with
money
and
the
ability
to
win
this
strike
sam
told
him
what
are
you
doing
it
for
demanded
frank
the
jewish
girl
sprang
to
her
feet
because
he
believes
in
these
women
and
wants
to
help
she
explained
rot
said
frank
going
out
at
the
door
it
was
snowing
when
the
meeting
ended
and
sam
and
the
jewish
girl
finished
their
talk
in
the
hallway
leading
to
her
room
i
don
t
know
what
harrigan
the
union
leader
from
pittsburgh
will
say
to
this
she
told
him
he
appointed
frank
to
lead
and
direct
the
strike
here
he
doesn
t
like
interference
and
he
may
not
like
your
plan
but
we
working
women
need
men
men
like
you
who
can
plan
and
do
things
there
are
too
many
men
living
on
us
we
need
men
who
will
work
for
all
of
us
as
the
men
work
for
the
women
in
the
carriages
and
she
laughed
and
put
out
a
hand
to
him
see
what
you
have
got
yourself
into
i
want
you
to
be
a
husband
to
our
entire
the
next
morning
four
girl
stenographers
went
to
work
in
sam
s
strike
headquarters
and
he
wrote
his
first
strike
letter
a
letter
telling
the
story
of
a
striking
girl
named
hadaway
whose
young
brother
was
sick
with
tuberculosis
sam
did
not
put
any
flourishes
in
the
letter
he
felt
that
he
did
not
need
to
he
thought
that
with
twenty
or
thirty
such
letters
each
telling
briefly
and
truthfully
the
story
of
one
of
the
striking
girls
he
should
be
able
to
show
one
american
town
how
its
other
half
lived
he
gave
the
letter
to
the
four
girl
stenographers
with
the
mailing
list
he
already
had
and
started
them
writing
it
to
each
of
the
names
at
eight
o
clock
a
man
came
in
to
install
a
telephone
and
girl
strikers
began
bringing
in
new
names
for
the
mailing
list
at
nine
o
clock
three
more
stenographers
appeared
and
were
put
to
work
and
girls
who
had
been
in
began
sending
more
names
over
the
phone
the
jewish
girl
walked
up
and
down
giving
orders
making
suggestions
from
time
to
time
she
ran
to
sam
s
desk
and
suggested
other
sources
of
names
for
the
mailing
list
sam
thought
that
if
the
other
working
girls
were
timid
and
embarrassed
before
him
this
one
was
not
she
was
like
a
general
on
the
field
of
battle
her
soft
brown
eyes
glowed
her
mind
worked
rapidly
and
her
voice
had
a
ring
in
it
at
her
suggestion
sam
gave
the
girls
at
the
typewriters
lists
bearing
the
names
of
town
officials
bankers
and
prominent
business
men
and
the
wives
of
all
these
also
presidents
of
various
women
s
clubs
society
women
and
charitable
organizations
she
called
reporters
from
the
town
s
two
daily
papers
and
had
them
interview
sam
and
at
her
suggestion
he
gave
them
copies
of
the
hadaway
girl
letter
to
print
print
it
he
said
and
if
you
can
not
use
it
as
news
make
it
an
advertisement
and
bring
the
bill
to
at
eleven
o
clock
frank
came
into
the
room
bringing
a
tall
irishman
with
sunken
cheeks
black
unclean
teeth
and
an
overcoat
too
small
for
him
leaving
him
standing
by
the
door
frank
walked
across
the
room
to
sam
come
to
lunch
with
us
he
said
he
jerked
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
toward
the
tall
irishman
i
picked
him
up
he
said

that

at
him
doubtfully
and
then
about
the
room
at
the
busy
girls
i
don
t
know
what

of

sat
down
by

headed

behind

was
a
short
strongly
built
man
with
blue
eyes
and
red
hair
he
walked
about
the
room
in
silence
followed
by
frank
suddenly
he
stopped
and
picking
up
one
of
the
typewriting
machines
rented
by
sam
for
the
letter

raised
it
above
his

pulled

started
for
the
door
he
saw
that
already
he
had
involved
himself
in
a
dozen
violations
of
the
unionist
code
and
the
idea
of
trying
to
convince
harrigan
of
his
disinterestedness

rapidly
along

of
the
lighted
stores
a
cold
rain

walked
on
in
silence
filled
with
wrath

turned
into
a
side
street
and
stopped
when
his
companion
put
a
hand
upon
his
arm

to
the
young
man
of

brown
beard
then
reaching
above

head
and
taking
a
cap
that
matched
his

on

he
winked
at
sam

on
old
top
i
ve

the
two
men
went
through
a
side
door
and
down
a
dark
alley
going
in
at
the
back
door
of
a
saloon
mud
lay
deep
in
the
alley
and
the
skipper
sloshed
through
it
splattering
sam
s
clothes
and
face
in
the
saloon
at
a
table
facing
sam
with
a
bottle
of
french
wine
between
them
he
began
explaining

s
a
system
now
about
this
he
plunged
into
a
discussion
of
the
strike
while
men
came
in
and
out
laughing
and
drinking
at
ten
o
clock
the
proprietor
locked
the
front
door
drew
the
curtain
and
coming
to
the
back
of
the
room
sat
down
at
the
table
with
sam
and
the
skipper
bringing
another
bottle
of
the
french
wine
from
which
the
two
men
continued
drinking
that
man
from
pittsburgh
busted
up
your
place
eh
he
said
turning
to
sam
a
man
came
in
here
and
told
me
he
sent
for
the
typewriter
people
and
made
them
take
away
the
when
they
were
ready
to
leave
sam
took
money
from
his
pocket
and
offered
to
pay
for
the
bottle
of
french
wine
ordered
by
the
skipper
who
arose
and
stood
unsteadily
on
his
feet
do
you
mean
to
insult
me
he
demanded
indignantly
throwing
a
bill
on
the
table
the
proprietor
gave
him
back
only
fourteen
dollars
i
might
as
well
wipe
off
the
slate
while
you
re
flush
he
observed
winking
at
sam
the
skipper
sat
down
again
taking
a
pencil
and
pad
of
paper
from
his
pocket
and
throwing
them
on
the
table
i
want
an
editorial
on
the
strike
for
the
old
rag
he
said
to
sam
do
one
for
me
do
something
strong
get
a
punch
into
it
i
want
to
talk
to
my
friend
putting
the
pad
of
paper
on
the
table
sam
began
writing
his
newspaper
editorial
his
head
seemed
wonderfully
clear
his
command
of
words
unusually
good
he
called
the
attention
of
the
public
to
the
situation
the
struggles
of
the
striking
girls
and
the
intelligent
fight
they
had
been
making
to
win
a
just
cause
following
this
with
paragraphs
pointing
out
how
the
effectiveness
of
the
work
done
had
been
annulled
by
the
position
taken
by
the
labour
and
socialist
leaders
these
fellows
at
bottom
care
nothing
for
results
he
wrote
they
are
not
thinking
of
the
unemployed
women
with
families
to
support
they
are
thinking
only
of
themselves
and
their
puny
leadership
which
they
fear
is
threatened
now
we
shall
have
the
usual
exhibition
of
all
the
old
things
struggle
and
hatred
and
when
he
had
finished
the
skipper
and
sam
went
back
through
the
alley
to
the
newspaper
office
the
skipper
sloshed
again
through
the
mud
and
carried
in
his
hand
a
bottle
of
red
gin
at
his
desk
he
took
the
editorial
from
sam
s
hands
and
read
it
perfect
perfect
to
the
thousandth
part
of
an
inch
old
top
he
said
pounding
sam
on
the
shoulder
just
what
the
old
rag
wanted
to
say
about
the
then
climbing
upon
the
desk
and
putting
the
plaid
coat
under
his
head
he
went
peacefully
to
sleep
and
sam
sitting
beside
the
desk
in
a
shaky
office
chair
slept
also
at
daybreak
a
black
man
with
a
broom
in
his
hand
woke
them
and
going
into
a
long
low
room
filled
with
presses
the
skipper
put
his
head
under
a
water
tap
and
came
back
waving
a
soiled
towel
and
with
water
dripping
from
his
hair
now
for
the
day
and
the
labours
thereof
he
said
grinning
at
sam
and
taking
a
long
drink
out
of
the
gin
bottle
after
breakfast
he
and
sam
took
up
their
stand
in
front
of
the
barber
shop
opposite
the
stairway
leading
to
the
shirtwaist
factory
sam
s
girl
with

walked
up
and
down

and
automobiles

by
the
curb
and
again
a
woman
got
out
of
a
machine
and
went
toward
three
striking
girls
approaching
along
the
sidewalk
the
woman
was
met
by
harrigan
shaking
his
fist
and
shouting
and
getting
back
into
the
machine
she
drove
off
from
the
stairway
the
hebrew
looked
at
the
crowd
and
laughed
where

new

he
called
to
frank
with
the
words
a
working

up

over
his
shoulder
come
over
to
the
dump
i
want
to
see
you
sam
returned
to
the
newspaper
office
and
sat
down
waiting
for
the
skipper
who
after
a
time
came
in
took
off
his
coat
and
began
writing
furiously
from
time
to
time
he
took
long
drinks
out
of
the
bottle
of
red
gin
and
after
silently
offering
it
to
sam
continued
reeling
off
sheet
after
sheet
of
matter
i
got
her
to
sign
the
note
he
called
over
his
shoulder
to
sam
she
was
furious
at
harrigan
and
when
i
told
her

were
going
to
attack
him
and
defend
you
she
fell
for
it
quick
i
won
out
by
following
my
system
i
always
get
drunk
and
it
always
at
ten
o
clock
the
newspaper
office
was
in
a
ferment
the
little
man
with
the
brown
pointed
beard
and
another
kept
running
to
the
skipper
asking
advice
laying
typewritten
sheets
before
him
talking
as
he
wrote
give
me
a
lead
i
want
one
more
front
page
lead
the
skipper
kept
bawling
at
them
working
like
mad
at
ten
thirty
the
door
opened
and
harrigan
accompanied
by
frank
came
in
seeing
sam
they
stopped
looking
at
him
uncertainly
and
at
the
man
at
work
at
the
desk
well
speak
up
this
is
no
ladies

room

the
skipper
glaring
at
them
frank
coming
forward
laid
a
typewritten
sheet
on
the
desk
which
the
newspaper
man
read
hurriedly
will

asked
frank
the
skipper
laughed

he
shouted

it
it
s
what
i
wanted
to
make
my
point
you
fellows
watch
frank
and
harrigan
went
out
and
the
skipper
rushing
to
the
door
began
yelling
into
the
room
beyond
hey
you
shorty
and
tom
i
ve
got
that
last
coming
back
to
his
desk
he
began
writing
again
grinning
as
he
worked
to
sam
he
handed
the
typewritten
sheet
prepared
by
frank
dastardly
attempt
to
win
the
cause
of
the
working
girls
by
dirty
scab
leaders
and
capitalist
class
it
began
and
after
this
followed
a
wild
jumble
of
words
words
without
meaning
sentences
without
point
in
which
sam
was
called
a
musser
and
the
skipper
was
mentioned
incidentally
as
a
pusillanimous
ink
slinger
i
ll
run
the
stuff
and
comment
on
it
declared
the
skipper
handing
sam
what
he
had
written
it
was
an
editorial
inviting
the
public
to
read
the
article
prepared
for
publication
by
the
strike
leaders
and
sympathising
with
the
striking
girls
that
their
cause
had
to
be
lost
because
of
the
incompetence
and
lack
of
intelligence
of
their
leaders
hurrah
for
roughhouse
the
brave
man
who
leads
working
girls
to
defeat
in
order
that
he
may
retain
leadership
and
drive
intelligent
effort
out
of
the
cause
of
labour
wrote
the
skipper
sam
looked
at
the
sheets
and
out
of
the
window
where
a
snow
storm
raged
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
crime
was
being
done
and
he
was
sick
and
disgusted
at
his
own
inability
to
stop
it
the
skipper
lighted
a
short
black
pipe
and
took
his
cap
from
a
nail
on
the
wall
i
m
the
smoothest
little
newspaper
thing
in
town
and
some
financier
as
well
he
declared
let
s
go
have
a
after
the
drink
sam
walked
through
the
town
toward
the
country
at
the
edge
of
town
where
the
houses
became
scattered
and
the
road
started
to
drop
away
into
a
deep
valley
some
one
helloed
behind
him
turning
he
saw
the
jewish
girl
running
along
a
path
beside
the
road
where
are
you
going
he
asked
stopping
to
lean
against
a
board
fence
the
snow
falling
upon
his
face
i
m
going
with
you
said
the
girl

best
and
the

pocket
in

and
gave
it
to
him
i
spent
three
hundred
and
fourteen
dollars
she
said
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
she
put
out
a
hand
and
laid
it
on
his
arm
her
eyes
soft
and
now
glowing
with
eager
light
looked
into
his
her
round
breasts
rose
and
fell
anywhere
you
say
i
ll
be
your
servant
if
you
ask
it
of
a
wave
of
hot
desire
ran
through
sam
followed
by
a
quick
reaction
he
thought
of
his
months
of
weary
seeking
and
his
universal
failure
you
are
going
back
to
town
if
i
have
to
drive
you
there
with
stones
he
told
her
and
turning
ran
down
the
valley
leaving
her
standing
by
the
board
fence
her
head
buried
in
her
arms
chapter
v
one
crisp
winter
evening
sam
found
himself
on
a
busy
street
corner
in
rochester
watching
from
a
doorway
the
crowds
of
people
hurrying
or
loitering
past
him
he
stood
in
a
doorway
near
a
corner
that
seemed
to
be
a
public
meeting
place
and
from
all
sides
came
men
and
women
who
met
at
the
corner
stood
for
a
moment
in
talk
and
then
went
away
together
sam
found
himself
beginning
to
wonder
about
the
meetings
in
the
year
since
he
had
walked
out
of
the
chicago
office
his
mind
had
grown
more
and
more
reflective
little
things
a
smile
on
the
lips
of
an
old
man
mumbling
and
hurrying
past
him
on
the
street
or
the
flutter
of
a
child
s
hand
from
the
doorway
of
a
farmhouse
had
furnished
him
food
for
hours
of
thought
now
he
watched
with
interest
the
little
incidents
the
nods
the
hand
clasps
the
hurried
stealthy
glances
around
of
the
men
and
women
who
met
for
a
moment
at
the
corner
on
the
sidewalk
near
his
doorway
several
men
evidently
from
a
large
hotel
around
the
corner
were
eyeing
with
unpleasant
hungry
furtive
eyes
the
women
in
the
crowd
a
large
blond
woman
stepped
into
the
doorway
beside
sam
waiting
for
some
one
she
asked
smiling
and
looking
steadily
at
him
with
the
harried
uncertain
hungry
light
he
had
seen
in
the
eyes
of
the
men
upon
the
sidewalk
what
are
you
doing
here
with
your
husband
at
work
he
ventured
she
looked
startled
and
then
laughed
why
don
t
you
hit
me
with
your
fist
if
you
want
to
jolt
me
like
that
she
demanded
adding
i
don
t
know
who
you
are
but
whoever
you
are
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
ve
quit
my
why
asked
sam
she
laughed
again
and
stepping
over
looked
at
him
closely
i
guess
you
re
bluffing
she
said
i
don
t
believe
you
know
alf
at
all
and
i
m
glad
you
don
t
i
ve
quit
alf
but
he
would
raise
cain
just
the
same
if
he
saw
me
out
here
sam
stepped
out
of
the
doorway
and
walked
down
a
side
street
past
a
lighted
theatre
along
the
street
women
raised
their
eyes
to
him
and
beyond
the
theatre
a
young
girl
brushing
against
him
muttered
hello
sport
sam
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
unhealthy
hungry
look
he
had
seen
in
the
eyes
of
the
men
and
women
his
mind
began
working
on
this
side
of
the
lives
of
great
numbers
of
people
in
the
cities
of
the
men
and
women
on
the
street
corner
of
the
woman
who
from
the
security
of
a
safe
marriage
had
once
thrown
a
challenge
into
his
eyes
as
they
sat
together
in
the
theatre
and
of
the
thousand
little
incidents
in
the
lives
of
all
modern
city
men
and
women
he
wondered
how
much
that
eager
aching
hunger
stood
in
the
way
of
men
s
getting
hold
of
life
and
living
it
earnestly
and
purposefully
as
he
wanted
to
live
it
and
as
he
felt
all
men
and
women
wanted
at
bottom
to
live
it
when
he
was
a
boy
in
caxton
he
was
more
than
once
startled
by
the
flashes
of
brutality
and
coarseness
in
the
speech
and
actions
of
kindly
men
now
as
he
walked
in
the
streets
of
the
city
he
thought
that
he
had
got
past
being
startled
it
is
a
quality
of
our
lives
he
decided
american
men
and
women
have
not
learned
to
be
clean
and
noble
and
natural
like
their
forests
and
their
wide
clean
he
thought
of
what
he
had
heard
of
london
and
of
paris
and
of
other
cities
of
the
old
world
and
following
an
impulse
acquired
through
his
lonely
wanderings
began
talking
to
himself
we
are
no
finer
nor
cleaner
than
these
he
said
and
we
sprang
from
the
big
clean
new
land
through
which
i
have
been
walking
all
these
months
will
mankind
always
go
on
with
that
old
aching
queerly
expressed
hunger
in
its
blood
and
with
that
look
in
its
eyes
will
it
never
shrive
itself
and
understand
itself
and
turn
fiercely
and
energetically
toward
the
building
of
a
bigger
and
cleaner
race
of
men
it
won
t
unless
you
help
came
the
answer
from
some
hidden
part
of
him
sam
fell
to
thinking
of
the
men
who
write
and
of
those
who
teach
and
he
wondered
why
they
did
not
all
of
them
talk
more
thoughtfully
of
vice
and
why
they
so
often
spent
their
talents
and
their
energies
in
futile
attacks
upon
some
phase
of
life
and
ended
their
efforts
toward
human
betterment
by
joining
or
promoting
a
temperance
league
or
stopping
the
playing
of
baseball
on
sunday
as
a
matter
of
fact
were
not
many
writers
and
reformers
unconsciously
in
league
with
the
procurer
in
that
they
treated
vice
and
profligacy
as
something
at
bottom
charming
he
himself
had
seen
none
of
this
vague
charm
for
me
he
reflected
there
have
been
no
françois
villons
or
sapphos
in
the
tenderloins
of
american
cities
there
have
been
instead
only
disease
and
ill
health
and
poverty
and
hard
brutal
faces
and
torn
greasy
he
thought
of
men
like
zola
who
saw
this
side
of
life
clearly
and
how
he
as
a
young
fellow
in
the
city
had
read
the
man
at
janet
eberly
s
suggestion
and
had
been
helped
by
him
helped
and
frightened
and
made
to
see
and
then
there
rose
before
him
the
leering
face
of
a
keeper
of
a
book
store
in
cleveland
who
some
weeks
before
had
pushed
across
the
counter
to
him
a
copy
of
nana
s
brother
saying
with
a
smirk
that
s
some
sporty
and
he
wondered
what
he
should
have
thought
had
he
bought
the
book
to
feed
the
imagination
the
bookseller
s
comment
was
intended
to
arouse
in
the
small
towns
through
which
sam
walked
and
in
the
small
town
in
which
he
grew
to
manhood
vice
was
openly
crude
and
masculine
it
went
to
sleep
sprawling
across
a
dirty
table
in
art
sherman
s
saloon
in
piety
hollow
and
the
newsboy
passed
it
without
comment
regretting
that
it
slept
and
that
it
had
no
money
with
which
to
buy
papers
dissipation
and
vice
get
into
the
life
of
youth
he
thought
coming
to
a
street
corner
where
young
men
played
pool
and
smoked
cigarettes
in
a
dingy
poolroom
and
turned
back
toward
the
heart
of
the
city
it
gets
into
all
modern
life
the
farmer
boy
coming
up
to
the
city
to
work
hears
lewd
stories
in
the
smoking
car
of
the
train
and
the
travelling
men
from
the
cities
tell
tales
of
the
city
streets
to
the
group
about
the
stove
in
village
sam
did
not
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
youth
touched
vice
such
things
were
a
part
of
the
world
that
men
and
women
had
made
for
their
sons
and
daughters
to
live
in
and
that
night
as
he
wandered
in
the
streets
of
rochester
he
thought
that
he
would
like
all
youth
to
know
if
they
could
but
know
truth
his
heart
was
bitter
at
the
thought
of
men
throwing
the
glamour
of
romance
over
the
sordid
ugly
things
he
had
been
seeing
in
that
city
and
in
every
city
he
had
known
past
him
in
a
street
lined
with
small
frame
houses
stumbled
a
man
far
gone
in
drink
by
whose
side
walked
a
boy
and
sam
s
mind
leaped
back
to
those
first
years
he
had
spent
in
the
city
and
of
the
staggering
old
man
he
had
left
behind
him
in
caxton
you
would
think
no
man
better
armed
against
vice
and
dissipation
than
that
painter
s
son
of
caxton
he
reminded
himself
and
yet
he
embraced
vice
he
found
as
all
young
men
find
that
there
is
much
misleading
talk
and
writing
on
the
subject
the
business
men
he
knew
did
not
part
with
able
assistance
because
it
did
not
sign
the
pledge
ability
was
too
rare
a
thing
and
too
independent
to
sign
pledges
and
the
sentiment
among
women
was
reserved
for
the
lips
that
did
not
he
began
reviewing
incidents
of
carouses
he
had
been
on
with
business
men
of
his
acquaintance
of
a
policeman
knocked
into
a
street
and
of
himself
quiet
and
ably
climbing
upon
tables
to
make
speeches
and
to
shout
the
innermost
secrets
of
his
heart
to
drunken
in
chicago
barrooms
normally
he
had
not
been
a
good
mixer
he
had
been
one
to
keep
himself
to
himself
but
on
these
carouses
he
let
himself
go
and
got
a
reputation
for
daring
audacity
by
slapping
men
on
the
back
and
singing
songs
with
them
a
glowing
cordiality
had
pervaded
him
and
for
a
time
he
had
really
believed
there
was
such
a
thing
as
high
flying
vice
that
glistens
in
the
sun
now
stumbling
past
lighted
saloons
wandering
unknown
in
a
city
s
streets
he
knew
better
all
vice
was
unclean
unhealthy
he
remembered
a
hotel
in
which
he
had
once
slept
a
hotel
that
admitted
questionable
couples
its
halls
had
become
dingy
its
windows
remained
unopened
dirt
gathered
in
the
corners
the
attendants
shuffled
as
they
walked
and
leered
into
the
faces
of
creeping
couples
the
curtains
at
the
windows
were
torn
and
discoloured
strange
snarling
oaths
screams
and
cries
jarred
the
tense
nerves
peace
and
cleanliness
had
fled
the
place
men
hurried
through
the
halls
with
hats
drawn
down
over
their
faces
sunlight
and
fresh
air
and
cheerful
whistling
bellboys
were
locked
out
he
thought
of
the
weary
restless
walks
taken
by
the
young
men
from
farms
and
country
towns
in
the
streets
of
the
cities
young
men
believers
in
the
golden
vice
hands
beckoned
to
them
from
doorways
and
women
of
the
town
laughed
at
their
awkwardness
in
chicago
he
had
walked
in
that
way
he
also
had
been
seeking
seeking
the
romantic
impossible
mistress
that
lurked
at
the
bottom
of
men
s
tales
of
the
submerged
world
he
wanted
his
golden
girl
he
was
like
the
naïve
german
lad
in
the
south
water
street
warehouses
who
had
once
said
to
him
he
was
a
frugal
soul
i
would
like
to
find
a
girl
who
is
quiet
and
modest
and
who
will
be
my
mistress
and
not
charge
sam
had
not
found
his
golden
girl
and
now
he
knew
she
did
not
exist
he
had
not
seen
the
places
called
by
the
preachers
the
palaces
of
sin
and
now
he
knew
there
were
no
such
places
he
wondered
why
youth
could
not
be
made
to
understand
that
sin
is
foul
and
that
immorality
reeks
of
vulgarity
why
could
not
they
be
told
plainly
that
there
are
no
housecleaning
days
in
the
tenderloin
during
his
married
life
men
had
come
to
the
house
who
discussed
this
matter
one
of
them
he
remembered
had
maintained
stoutly
that
the
scarlet
sisterhood
was
a
necessity
of
modern
life
and
that
ordinary
decent
social
life
could
not
go
on
without
it
often
during
the
past
year
sam
had
thought
of
the
man
s
talk
and
his
brain
had
reeled
before
the
thought
in
towns
and
on
country
roads
he
had
seen
troops
of
little
girls
come
laughing
and
shouting
out
of
school
houses
and
had
wondered
which
of
them
would
be
chosen
for
that
service
to
mankind
and
now
in
his
hour
of
depression
he
wished
that
the
man
who
had
talked
at
his
dinner
table
might
be
made
to
walk
with
him
and
to
share
with
him
his
thoughts
turning
again
into
a
lighted
busy
thoroughfare
of
the
city
sam
continued
his
study
of
the
faces
in
the
crowds
to
do
this
quieted
and
soothed
his
mind
he
began
to
feel
a
weariness
in
his
legs
and
thought
with
gratitude
that
he
should
have
a
night
of
good
sleep
the
sea
of
faces
rolling
up
to
him
under
the
lights
filled
him
with
peace
there
is
so
much
of
life
he
thought
it
must
come
to
some
looking
intently
at
the
faces
the
dull
faces
and
the
bright
faces
the
faces
drawn
out
of
shape
and
with
eyes
nearly
meeting
above
the
nose
the
faces
with
long
heavy
sensual
jaws
and
the
empty
soft
faces
on
which
the
scalding
finger
of
thought
had
left
no
mark
his
fingers
ached
to
get
a
pencil
in
his
hand
or
to
spread
the
faces
upon
canvas
in
enduring
pigments
to
hold
them
up
before
the
world
and
to
be
able
to
say
here
are
the
faces
you
by
your
lives
have
made
for
yourselves
and
for
your
in
the
lobby
of
a
tall
office
building
where
he
stopped
at
a
little
cigar
counter
to
get
fresh
tobacco
for
his
pipe
he
looked
so
fixedly
at
a
woman
clad
in
long
soft
furs
that
in
alarm
she
hurried
out
to
her
machine
to
wait
for
her
escort
who
had
evidently
gone
up
the
elevator
once
more
in
the
street
sam
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
hands
that
had
laboured
that
the
soft
cheeks
and
the
untroubled
eyes
of
this
one
woman
might
be
into
his
mind
came
the
face
and
figure
of
a
little
canadian
nurse
who
had
once
cared
for
him
through
an
illness
her
quick
deft
fingers
and
her
muscular
little
arms
another
such
as
she
he
muttered
has
been
at
work
upon
the
face
and
body
of
this
gentlewoman
a
hunter
has
gone
into
the
white
silence
of
the
north
to
bring
out
the
warm
furs
that
adorn
her
for
her
there
has
been
a
tragedy
a
shot
and
red
blood
upon
the
snow
and
a
struggling
beast
waving
its
little
claws
in
the
air
for
her
a
woman
has
worked
through
the
morning
bathing
her
white
limbs
her
cheeks
her
for
this
gentlewoman
also
there
had
been
a
man
apportioned
a
man
like
himself
who
had
cheated
and
lied
and
gone
through
the
years
in
pursuit
of
the
dollars
to
pay
all
of
the
others
a
man
of
power
a
man
who
could
achieve
could
accomplish
again
he
felt
within
him
a
yearning
for
the
power
of
the
artist
the
power
not
only
to
see
the
meaning
of
the
faces
in
the
street
but
to
reproduce
what
he
saw
to
get
with
subtle
fingers
the
story
of
the
achievement
of
mankind
into
a
face
hanging
upon
a
wall
in
other
days
in
caxton
listening
to
telfer
s
talk
and
in
chicago
and
new
york
with
sue
sam
had
tried
to
get
an
inkling
of
the
passion
of
the
artist
now
walking
and
looking
at
the
faces
rolling
past
him
on
the
long
street
he
thought
that
he
did
understand
once
when
he
was
new
in
the
city
he
had
for
some
months
carried
on
an
affair
with
a
woman
the
daughter
of
a
cattle
farmer
from
iowa
now
her
face
filled
his
vision
how
rugged
it
was
how
filled
with
the
message
of
the
ground
underfoot
the
thick
lips
the
dull
eyes
the
strong
head
how
like
the
cattle
her
father
had
bought
and
sold
he
remembered
the
little
room
in
chicago
where
he
had
his
first
love
passage
with
this
woman
how
frank
and
wholesome
it
had
seemed
how
eagerly
both
man
and
woman
had
rushed
at
evening
to
the
meeting
place
how
her
strong
hands
had
clasped
him
the
face
of
the
woman
in
the
motor
by
the
office
building
danced
before
his
eyes
the
face
so
peaceful
so
free
from
the
marks
of
human
passion
and
he
wondered
what
daughter
of
a
cattle
raiser
had
taken
the
passion
out
of
the
man
who
paid
for
the
beauty
of
that
face
on
a
side
street
near
the
lighted
front
of
a
cheap
theatre
a
woman
standing
alone
and
half
concealed
in
the
doorway
of
a
church
called
softly
and
turning
he
went
to
her
i
am
not
a
customer
he
said
looking
at
her
thin
face
and
bony
hands
but
if
you
care
to
come
with
me
i
will
stand
a
good
dinner
i
am
getting
hungry
and
do
not
like
eating
alone
i
want
some
one
to
talk
to
me
so
that
i
won
t
get
to
you
re
a
queer
bird
said
the
woman
taking
his
arm
what
have
you
done
that
you
don
t
want
to
think
sam
said
nothing
there
s
a
place
over
there
she
said
pointing
to
the
lighted
front
of
a
cheap
restaurant
with
soiled
curtains
at
the
windows
sam
kept
on
walking
if
you
do
not
mind
he
said
i
will
pick
the
place
i
want
to
buy
a
good
dinner
i
want
a
place
with
clean
linen
on
the
table
and
a
good
cook
in
the
they
stopped
at
a
corner
to
talk
of
the
dinner
and
at
her
suggestion
he
waited
at
a
drug
store
while
she
went
to
her
room
as
he
waited
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
ordered
the
dinner
and
a
taxicab
when
she
returned
she
had
on
a
clean
shirtwaist
and
had
combed
her
hair
sam
thought
he
caught
the
odour
of
benzine
and
guessed
she
had
been
at
work
on
the
spots
on
her
worn
jacket
she
seemed
surprised
to
find
him
still
waiting
i
thought
maybe
it
was
a
stall
she
said
they
drove
in
silence
to
a
place
sam
had
in
mind
a
with
clean
washed
floors
painted
walls
and
open
fires
in
the
private
sam
had
been
there
several
times
during
the
month
and
the
food
had
been
well
cooked
they
ate
in
silence
sam
had
no
curiosity
to
hear
her
talk
of
herself
and
she
seemed
to
have
no
knack
of
casual
conversation
he
was
not
studying
her
but
had
brought
her
as
he
had
said
because
of
his
loneliness
and
because
her
thin
tired
face
and
frail
body
looking
out
from
the
darkness
by
the
church
door
had
made
an
appeal
she
had
he
thought
a
look
of
hard
chastity
like
one
whipped
but
not
defeated
her
cheeks
were
thin
and
covered
with
freckles
like
a
boy
s
her
teeth
were
broken
and
in
bad
repair
though
clean
and
her
hands
had
the
worn
look
of
his
own
mother
s
hands
now
that
she
sat
before
him
in
the
restaurant
in
some
vague
way
she
resembled
his
mother
after
dinner
he
sat
smoking
his
cigar
and
looking
at
the
fire
the
woman
of
the
streets
leaned
across
the
table
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
are
you
going
to
take
me
anywhere
after
this
after
we
leave
here
she
said
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
the
door
of
your
room
that
s
i
m
glad
she
said
it
s
a
long
time
since
i
ve
had
an
evening
like
this
it
makes
me
feel
for
a
time
they
sat
in
silence
and
then
sam
began
talking
of
his
home
town
in
iowa
letting
himself
go
and
expressing
the
thoughts
that
came
into
his
mind
he
told
her
of
his
mother
and
of
mary
underwood
and
she
in
turn
told
of
her
town
and
of
her
life
she
had
some
difficulty
about
hearing
which
made
conversation
trying
words
and
sentences
had
to
be
repeated
to
her
and
after
a
time
sam
smoked
and
looked
at
the
fire
letting
her
talk
her
father
had
been
a
captain
of
a
small
steamboat
plying
up
and
down
long
island
sound
and
her
mother
a
careful
shrewd
woman
and
a
good
housekeeper
they
had
lived
in
a
rhode
island
village
and
had
a
garden
back
of
their
house
the
captain
had
not
married
until
he
was
and
had
died
when
the
girl
was
eighteen
the
mother
dying
a
year
later
the
girl
had
not
been
much
known
in
the
rhode
island
village
being
shy
and
reticent
she
had
kept
the
house
clean
and
helped
the
captain
in
the
garden
when
her
parents
were
dead
she
had
found
herself
alone
with
hundred
dollars
in
the
bank
and
the
little
home
and
had
married
a
young
man
who
was
a
clerk
in
a
railroad
office
and
sold
the
house
to
move
to
kansas
city
the
big
flat
country
frightened
her
her
life
there
had
been
unsuccessful
she
had
been
lonely
for
the
hills
and
the
water
of
her
new
england
village
and
she
was
by
nature
undemonstrative
and
unemotional
so
that
she
did
not
get
much
hold
of
her
husband
he
had
undoubtedly
married
her
for
the
little
hoard
and
by
various
devices
began
getting
it
from
her
a
son
had
been
born
for
a
time
her
health
broke
badly
and
she
discovered
through
an
accident
that
her
husband
was
spending
her
money
in
dissipation
among
the
women
of
the
town
there
wasn
t
any
use
wasting
words
when
i
found
he
didn
t
care
for
me
or
for
the
baby
and
wouldn
t
support
us
so
i
left
him
she
said
in
a
level
businesslike
way
when
she
came
to
count
up
after
she
had
got
clear
of
her
husband
and
had
taken
a
course
in
stenography
there
was
one
thousand
dollars
of
her
savings
left
and
she
felt
pretty
safe
she
took
a
position
and
went
to
work
feeling
well
satisfied
and
happy
and
then
came
the
trouble
with
her
hearing
she
began
to
lose
places
and
finally
had
to
be
content
with
a
small
salary
earned
by
copying
form
letters
for
a
mail
order
medicine
man
the
boy
she
put
out
with
a
capable
german
woman
the
wife
of
a
gardener
she
paid
four
dollars
a
week
for
him
and
there
was
clothing
to
be
bought
for
herself
and
the
boy
her
wage
from
the
medicine
man
was
seven
dollars
a
week
and
so
she
said
i
began
going
on
the
street
i
knew
no
one
and
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
i
couldn
t
do
that
in
the
town
where
the
boy
lived
so
i
came
away
i
ve
gone
from
city
to
city
working
mostly
for
patent
medicine
men
and
filling
out
my
income
by
what
i
earned
in
the
streets
i
m
not
naturally
a
woman
who
cares
about
men
and
not
many
of
them
care
about
me
i
don
t
like
to
have
them
touch
me
with
their
hands
i
can
t
drink
as
most
of
the
girls
do
it
sickens
me
i
want
to
be
left
alone
perhaps
i
shouldn
t
have
married
not
that
i
minded
my
husband
we
got
along
very
well
until
i
had
to
stop
giving
him
money
when
i
found
where
it
was
going
it
opened
my
eyes
i
felt
that
i
had
to
have
at
least
a
thousand
dollars
for
the
boy
in
case
anything
happened
to
me
when
i
found
there
wasn
t
anything
to
do
but
just
go
on
the
streets
i
went
i
tried
doing
other
work
but
hadn
t
the
strength
and
when
it
came
to
the
test
i
cared
more
about
the
boy
than
i
did
about
myself
any
woman
would
i
thought
he
was
of
more
importance
than
what
i
wanted
it
hasn
t
been
easy
for
me
sometimes
when
i
have
got
a
man
to
go
with
me
i
walk
along
the
street
praying
that
i
won
t
shudder
and
draw
away
when
he
touches
me
with
his
hands
i
know
that
if
i
do
he
will
go
away
and
i
won
t
get
any
money
and
then
they
talk
and
lie
about
themselves
i
ve
had
them
try
to
work
off
bad
money
and
worthless
jewelry
on
me
sometimes
they
try
to
make
love
to
me
and
then
steal
back
the
money
they
have
given
me
that
s
the
hard
part
the
lying
and
the
pretence
all
day
i
write
the
same
lies
over
and
over
for
the
men
and
then
at
night
i
listen
to
these
others
lying
to
she
stopped
talking
and
leaning
over
put
her
cheek
down
on
her
hand
and
sat
looking
into
the
fire
my
mother
she
began
again
didn
t
always
wear
a
clean
dress
she
couldn
t
she
was
always
down
on
her
knees
scrubbing
around
the
floor
or
out
in
the
garden
pulling
weeds
but
she
hated
dirt
if
her
dress
was
dirty
her
underwear
was
clean
and
so
was
her
body
she
taught
me
to
be
that
way
and
i
wanted
to
be
it
came
naturally
but
i
m
losing
it
all
all
evening
i
have
been
sitting
here
with
you
thinking
that
my
underwear
isn
t
clean
most
of
the
time
i
don
t
care
being
clean
doesn
t
go
with
what
i
am
doing
i
have
to
keep
trying
to
be
flashy
outside
so
that
men
will
stop
when
they
see
me
on
the
street
sometimes
when
i
have
done
well
i
don
t
go
on
the
streets
for
three
or
four
weeks
then
i
clean
up
my
room
and
bathe
myself
my
landlady
lets
me
do
my
washing
in
the
basement
at
night
i
don
t
seem
to
care
about
cleanliness
the
weeks
i
am
on
the
the
little
german
orchestra
began
playing
a
lullaby
and
a
fat
german
waiter
came
in
at
the
open
door
and
put
more
wood
on
the
fire
he
stopped
by
the
table
and
talked
about
the
mud
in
the
road
outside
from
another
room
came
the
silvery
clink
of
glasses
and
the
sound
of
laughing
voices
the
girl
and
sam
drifted
back
into
talk
of
their
home
towns
sam
felt
that
he
liked
her
very
much
and
thought
that
if
she
had
belonged
to
him
he
should
have
found
a
basis
on
which
to
live
with
her
contentedly
she
had
a
quality
of
honesty
that
he
was
always
seeking
in
people
as
they
drove
back
to
the
city
she
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
i
wouldn
t
mind
about
you
she
said
looking
at
him
frankly
sam
laughed
and
patted
her
thin
hand
it
s
been
a
good
evening
he
said
we
ll
go
through
with
it
as
it
thanks
for
that
she
said
and
there
is
something
else
i
want
to
tell
you
perhaps
you
will
think
it
bad
of
me
sometimes
when
i
don
t
want
to
go
on
the
streets
i
get
down
on
my
knees
and
pray
for
strength
to
go
on
gamely
does
it
seem
bad
we
are
a
praying
people
we
new
as
he
stood
in
the
street
sam
could
hear
her
laboured
asthmatic
breathing
as
she
climbed
the
stairs
to
her
room
half
way
up
she
stopped
and
waved
her
hand
at
him
the
thing
was
awkwardly
done
and
boyish
sam
had
a
feeling
that
he
should
like
to
get
a
gun
and
begin
shooting
citizens
in
the
streets
he
stood
in
the
lighted
city
looking
down
the
long
deserted
street
and
thought
of
mike
mccarthy
in
the
jail
at
caxton
like
mike
he
lifted
up
his
voice
in
the
night
are
you
there
o
god
have
you
left
your
children
here
on
the
earth
hurting
each
other
do
you
put
the
seed
of
a
million
children
in
a
man
and
the
planting
of
a
forest
in
one
tree
and
permit
men
to
wreck
and
hurt
and
destroy
chapter
vi
one
morning
at
the
end
of
his
second
year
of
wandering
sam
got
out
of
his
bed
in
a
cold
little
hotel
in
a
mining
village
in
west
virginia
looked
at
the
miners
their
lamps
in
their
caps
going
through
the
dimly
lighted
streets
ate
a
portion
of
leathery
breakfast
cakes
paid
his
bill
at
the
hotel
and
took
a
train
for
new
york
he
had
definitely
abandoned
the
idea
of
getting
at
what
he
wanted
through
wandering
about
the
country
and
talking
to
chance
acquaintances
by
the
wayside
and
in
villages
and
had
decided
to
return
to
a
way
of
life
more
befitting
his
income
he
felt
that
he
was
not
by
nature
a
vagabond
and
that
the
call
of
the
wind
and
the
sun
and
the
brown
road
was
not
insistent
in
his
blood
the
spirit
of
pan
did
not
command
him
and
although
there
were
certain
spring
mornings
of
his
wandering
days
that
were
like
mountain
tops
in
his
experience
of
life
mornings
when
some
strong
sweet
feeling
ran
through
the
trees
and
the
grass
and
the
body
of
the
wanderer
and
when
the
call
of
life
seemed
to
come
shouting
and
inviting
down
the
wind
filling
him
with
delight
of
the
blood
in
his
body
and
the
thoughts
in
his
brain
yet
at
bottom
and
in
spite
of
these
days
of
pure
joy
he
was
after
all
a
man
of
the
towns
and
the
crowds
caxton
and
south
water
street
and
lasalle
street
had
all
left
their
marks
on
him
and
so
throwing
his
canvas
jacket
into
a
corner
of
the
room
in
the
west
virginia
hotel
he
returned
to
the
haunts
of
his
kind
in
new
york
he
went
to
an
uptown
club
where
he
owned
a
membership
and
into
the
grill
where
he
found
at
breakfast
an
actor
acquaintance
named
jackson
sam
dropped
into
a
chair
and
looked
about
him
he
remembered
a
visit
he
had
made
there
some
years
before
with
webster
and
crofts
and
felt
again
the
quiet
elegance
of
the
surroundings
hello
moneymaker
said
jackson
heartily
heard
you
had
gone
to
a
sam
laughed
and
began
ordering
a
breakfast
that
made
jackson
s
eyes
open
with
astonishment
you
elegance
would
not
understand
a
man
s
spending
month
after
month
in
the
open
air
seeking
a
good
body
and
an
end
in
life
and
then
suddenly
changing
his
mind
and
coming
back
to
a
place
like
this
he
observed
jackson
laughed
and
lighted
a
cigarette
how
little
you
know
me
he
said
i
would
live
my
life
in
the
open
but
that
i
am
a
mighty
good
actor
and
have
just
finished
another
long
new
york
run
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
that
you
are
thin
and
brown
will
you
go
back
to
morrison
and
prince
and
money
making
sam
shook
his
head
and
looked
at
the
quiet
elegance
of
the
man
before
him
how
satisfied
and
happy
he
looked
i
am
going
to
try
living
among
the
rich
and
the
leisurely
he
said
they
are
a
rotten
crew
jackson
assured
him
and
i
am
taking
a
night
train
for
detroit
come
with
me
we
will
talk
things
on
the
train
that
night
they
got
into
talk
with
a
old
man
who
told
them
of
a
hunting
trip
on
which
he
was
bound
i
am
going
to
sail
from
seattle
he
said
and
go
everywhere
and
hunt
everything
i
am
going
to
shoot
the
head
off
of
every
big
animal
kind
of
thing
left
in
the
world
and
then
come
back
to
new
york
and
stay
there
until
i
i
will
go
with
you
said
sam
and
in
the
morning
left
jackson
at
detroit
and
continued
westward
with
his
new
acquaintance
for
months
sam
travelled
and
shot
with
the
old
man
a
vigorous
old
fellow
who
having
become
wealthy
through
an
early
investment
in
stock
of
the
standard
oil
company
devoted
his
life
to
his
lusty
primitive
passion
for
shooting
and
killing
they
went
on
lion
hunts
elephant
hunts
and
tiger
hunts
and
when
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
sam
took
a
boat
for
london
his
companion
walked
up
and
down
the
beach
smoking
black
cheroots
and
declaring
the
fun
was
only
half
over
and
that
sam
was
a
fool
to
go
after
the
year
of
the
hunt
royal
sam
spent
another
year
living
the
life
of
a
gentleman
of
wealth
and
leisure
in
london
new
york
and
paris
he
went
on
automobile
trips
fished
and
loafed
along
the
shores
of
northern
lakes
canoed
through
canada
with
a
writer
of
nature
books
and
sat
about
clubs
and
fashionable
hotels
listening
to
the
talk
of
the
men
and
women
of
that
world
late
one
afternoon
in
the
spring
of
the
year
he
went
to
the
village
on
the
hudson
river
where
sue
had
taken
a
house
and
almost
immediately
saw
her
for
an
hour
he
followed
watching
her
quick
active
little
figure
as
she
walked
through
the
village
streets
and
wondering
what
life
had
come
to
mean
to
her
but
when
turning
suddenly
she
would
have
come
face
to
face
with
him
he
hurried
down
a
side
street
and
took
a
train
to
the
city
feeling
that
he
could
not
face
her
and
ashamed
after
the
years
in
the
end
he
started
drinking
again
not
moderately
now
but
steadily
and
almost
continuously
one
night
in
detroit
with
three
young
men
from
his
hotel
he
got
drunk
and
was
for
the
first
time
since
his
parting
with
sue
in
the
company
of
women
four
of
them
met
in
some
restaurant
got
into
an
automobile
with
sam
and
the
three
young
men
and
rode
about
town
laughing
waving
bottles
of
wine
in
the
air
and
calling
to
in
the
street
they
wound
up
in
a
diningroom
in
a
place
at
the
edge
of
town
where
the
party
spent
hours
around
a
long
table
drinking
and
singing
songs
one
of
the
girls
sat
on
sam
s
lap
and
put
an
arm
about
his
neck
give
me
some
money
rich
man
she
said
sam
looked
at
her
closely
who
are
you
he
asked
she
began
explaining
that
she
was
a
clerk
in
a
downtown
store
and
that
she
had
a
lover
who
drove
a
laundry
wagon
i
go
on
these
bats
to
get
money
to
buy
good
clothes
she
said
frankly
but
if
tim
saw
me
here
he
would
kill
putting
a
bill
into
her
hand
sam
went
downstairs
and
getting
into
a
taxicab
drove
back
to
his
hotel
after
that
night
he
went
frequently
on
carouses
of
this
kind
he
was
in
a
kind
of
prolonged
stupor
of
inaction
talked
of
trips
abroad
which
he
did
not
take
bought
a
huge
farm
in
virginia
which
he
never
visited
planned
a
return
to
business
which
he
did
not
execute
and
month
after
month
continued
to
waste
his
days
he
would
get
out
of
bed
at
noon
and
begin
drinking
steadily
as
the
afternoon
passed
he
grew
merry
and
talkative
calling
men
by
their
first
names
slapping
chance
acquaintances
on
the
back
playing
pool
or
billiards
with
skilful
young
men
intent
upon
gain
in
the
early
summer
he
got
in
with
a
party
of
young
men
from
new
york
and
with
them
spent
months
in
sheer
idle
waste
of
time
together
they
drove
automobiles
on
long
trips
drank
quarrelled
and
went
on
board
a
yacht
to
carouse
alone
or
with
women
at
times
sam
would
leave
his
companions
and
spend
days
riding
through
the
country
on
fast
trains
sitting
for
hours
in
silence
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
passing
country
and
wondering
at
his
endurance
of
the
life
he
led
for
some
months
he
carried
with
him
a
young
man
whom
he
called
a
secretary
and
paid
a
large
salary
for
his
ability
to
tell
stories
and
sing
clever
songs
only
to
discharge
him
suddenly
for
telling
a
foul
tale
that
reminded
sam
of
another
tale
told
by
the
old
man
in
the
office
of
ed
s
hotel
in
the
illinois
town
from
being
silent
and
taciturn
as
during
the
months
of
his
wanderings
sam
became
morose
and
combative
staying
on
and
on
in
the
empty
aimless
way
of
life
he
had
adopted
he
yet
felt
that
there
was
for
him
a
right
way
of
living
and
wondered
at
his
continued
inability
to
find
it
he
lost
his
native
energy
grew
fat
and
coarse
of
body
was
pleased
for
hours
by
little
things
read
no
books
lay
for
hours
in
bed
drunk
and
talking
nonsense
to
himself
ran
about
the
streets
swearing
vilely
grew
habitually
coarse
in
thought
and
speech
sought
constantly
a
lower
and
more
vulgar
set
of
companions
was
brutal
and
ugly
with
attendants
about
hotels
and
clubs
where
he
lived
hated
life
but
ran
like
a
coward
to
sanitariums
and
health
resorts
at
the
wagging
of
a
doctor
s
head
book
iv
chapter
i
one
afternoon
in
early
september
sam
got
on
a
train
intending
to
visit
his
sister
on
the
farm
near
caxton
for
years
he
had
heard
nothing
from
kate
but
she
had
he
knew
two
daughters
and
he
thought
he
would
do
something
for
them
i
will
put
them
on
the
virginia
farm
and
make
a
will
leaving
them
my
money
he
thought
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
make
them
happy
by
setting
them
up
in
life
and
giving
them
beautiful
clothes
to
at
louis
he
got
off
the
train
thinking
vaguely
that
he
would
see
an
attorney
and
make
arrangements
about
the
will
and
for
several
days
stayed
about
the
planters
hotel
with
a
set
of
drinking
companions
he
had
picked
up
one
afternoon
he
began
going
from
place
to
place
drinking
and
gathering
companions
an
ugly
light
was
in
his
eyes
and
he
looked
at
men
and
women
passing
in
the
streets
feeling
that
he
was
in
the
midst
of
enemies
and
that
for
him
the
peace
contentment
and
good
cheer
that
shone
out
of
the
eyes
of
others
was
beyond
getting
in
the
late
afternoon
followed
by
a
troop
of
roistering
companions
he
came
out
upon
a
street
flanked
with
small
brick
warehouses
facing
the
river
where
steamboats
lay
tied
to
floating
docks
i
want
a
boat
to
take
me
and
my
crowd
for
a
cruise
up
and
down
the
river
he
announced
approaching
the
captain
of
one
of
the
boats
take
us
up
and
down
the
river
until
we
are
tired
of
it
i
will
pay
what
it
it
was
one
of
the
days
when
drink
would
not
take
hold
of
him
and
he
went
among
his
companions
buying
drinks
and
thinking
himself
a
fool
to
continue
furnishing
entertainment
for
the
vile
crew
that
sat
about
him
on
the
deck
of
the
boat
he
began
shouting
and
ordering
them
about
sing
louder
he
commanded
tramping
up
and
down
and
scowling
at
his
companions
a
young
man
of
the
party
who
had
a
reputation
as
a
dancer
refused
to
perform
when
commanded
springing
forward
sam
dragged
him
out
on
the
deck
before
the
shouting
crowd
now
dance
he
growled
or
i
will
throw
you
into
the
the
young
man
danced
furiously
and
sam
marched
up
and
down
and
looked
at
him
and
at
the
leering
faces
of
the
men
and
women
lounging
along
the
deck
or
shouting
at
the
dancer
the
liquor
in
him
beginning
to
take
effect
a
queerly
distorted
version
of
his
old
passion
for
reproduction
came
to
him
and
he
raised
his
hand
for
silence
i
want
to
see
a
woman
who
is
a
mother
he
shouted
i
want
to
see
a
woman
who
has
borne
a
small
woman
with
black
hair
and
burning
black
eyes
sprang
from
the
group
gathered
about
the
dancer
i
have
borne
children
three
of
them
she
said
laughing
up
into
his
face
i
can
bear
more
of
sam
looked
at
her
stupidly
and
taking
her
by
the
arm
led
her
to
a
chair
on
the
deck
the
crowd
laughed
belle
is
after
his
roll
whispered
a
short
fat
man
to
his
companion
a
tall
woman
with
blue
eyes
as
the
steamer
with
its
load
of
men
and
women
drinking
and
singing
songs
went
up
the
river
past
bluffs
covered
with
trees
the
woman
beside
sam
pointed
to
a
row
of
tiny
houses
at
the
top
of
the
bluffs
my
children
are
there
they
are
getting
supper
now
she
said
she
began
singing
laughing
and
waving
a
bottle
to
the
others
sitting
along
the
deck
a
youth
with
heavy
features
stood
upon
a
chair
and
sang
a
song
of
the
street
and
jumping
to
her
feet
sam
s
companion
kept
time
with
the
bottle
in
her
hand
sam
walked
over
to
where
the
captain
stood
looking
up
the
river
turn
back
he
said
i
am
tired
of
this
on
the
way
back
down
the
river
the
woman
again
sat
beside
sam
we
will
go
to
my
house
she
said
quietly
just
you
and
me
i
will
show
you
the
darkness
was
gathering
over
the
river
as
the
boat
turned
and
in
the
distance
the
lights
of
the
city
began
blinking
into
view
the
crowd
had
grown
quiet
sleeping
in
chairs
along
the
deck
or
gathering
in
small
groups
and
talking
in
low
tones
the
woman
began
to
tell
sam
her
story
she
was
she
said
the
wife
of
a
plumber
who
had
left
her
i
drove
him
crazy
she
said
laughing
quietly
he
wanted
me
to
stay
at
home
with
him
and
the
kids
night
after
night
he
used
to
follow
me
down
town
at
night
begging
me
to
come
home
when
i
wouldn
t
come
he
would
go
away
with
tears
in
his
eyes
it
made
me
furious
he
wasn
t
a
man
he
would
do
anything
i
asked
him
to
do
and
then
he
ran
away
and
left
the
kids
on
my
in
the
city
sam
with
the
woman
beside
him
rode
about
in
an
open
carriage
forgetting
the
children
and
going
from
place
to
place
eating
and
drinking
for
an
hour
they
sat
in
a
box
at
the
theatre
but
grew
tired
of
the
performance
and
climbed
again
into
the
carriage
we
will
go
to
my
house
i
want
to
have
you
alone
said
the
woman
they
drove
through
street
after
street
of
workingmen
s
houses
where
children
ran
laughing
and
playing
under
the
lights
and
two
boys
their
bare
legs
flashing
in
the
lights
from
the
lamps
overhead
ran
after
them
holding
to
the
back
of
the
carriage
the
driver
whipped
the
horses
and
looked
back
laughing
the
woman
got
up
and
kneeling
on
the
seat
of
the
carriage
laughed
down
into
the
faces
of
the
running
boys
run
you
little
devils
she
cried
they
held
on
running
furiously
their
legs
twinkled
and
flashed
under
the
lights
give
me
a
silver
dollar
she
said
turning
to
sam
and
when
he
had
given
it
to
her
threw
it
ringing
upon
the
pavement
under
a
street
lamp
the
two
boys
darted
for
it
shouting
and
waving
their
hands
to
her
swarms
of
huge
flies
and
beetles
circled
under
the
street
lamps
striking
sam
and
the
woman
in
the
face
one
of
them
a
great
black
crawling
thing
alighted
on
her
breast
and
taking
it
in
her
hand
she
crept
forward
and
dropped
it
down
the
neck
of
the
driver
in
spite
of
his
hard
drinking
during
the
afternoon
and
evening
sam
s
head
was
clear
and
a
calm
hatred
of
life
burned
in
him
his
mind
ran
back
over
the
years
he
had
passed
since
breaking
his
word
to
sue
and
a
scorn
of
all
effort
burned
in
him
it
is
what
a
man
gets
who
goes
seeking
truth
he
thought
he
comes
to
a
fine
end
in
on
all
sides
of
him
life
ran
playing
on
the
pavement
and
leaping
in
the
air
it
circled
and
buzzed
and
sang
above
his
head
in
the
summer
night
there
in
the
heart
of
the
city
even
in
the
sullen
man
sitting
in
the
carriage
beside
the
woman
it
began
to
sing
the
blood
climbed
through
his
body
an
old
longing
half
hunger
half
hope
awoke
in
him
pulsating
and
insistent
he
looked
at
the
laughing
intoxicated
woman
beside
him
and
a
feeling
of
masculine
approval
shot
through
him
he
began
thinking
of
what
she
had
said
before
the
laughing
crowd
on
the
steamer
i
have
borne
three
children
and
can
bear
his
blood
stirred
by
the
sight
of
the
woman
awoke
his
sleeping
brain
and
he
began
again
to
quarrel
with
life
and
what
life
had
offered
him
he
thought
that
always
he
would
stubbornly
refuse
to
accept
the
call
of
life
unless
he
could
have
it
on
his
own
terms
unless
he
could
command
and
direct
it
as
he
had
commanded
and
directed
the
gun
company
else
why
am
i
here
he
muttered
looking
away
from
the
vacant
laughing
face
of
the
woman
and
at
the
broad
muscular
back
of
the
driver
on
the
seat
in
front
why
had
i
a
brain
and
a
dream
and
a
hope
why
went
i
about
seeking
truth
his
mind
ran
on
in
the
vein
started
by
the
sight
of
the
circling
beetles
and
the
running
boys
the
woman
put
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
and
her
black
hair
blew
against
his
face
she
struck
wildly
at
the
circling
beetles
laughing
like
a
child
when
she
had
caught
one
of
them
in
her
hand
men
like
me
are
for
some
end
they
are
not
to
be
played
with
as
i
have
been
he
muttered
clinging
to
the
hand
of
the
woman
who
also
he
thought
was
being
tossed
about
by
life
before
a
saloon
on
a
street
where
cars
ran
the
carriage
stopped
through
the
open
front
door
sam
could
see
standing
before
a
bar
drinking
foaming
glasses
of
beer
the
hanging
lamps
above
their
heads
throwing
their
black
shadows
upon
the
floor
a
strong
stale
smell
came
out
at
the
door
the
woman
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
shouted
o
will
come
out
a
man
clad
in
a
long
white
apron
and
with
his
shirt
sleeves
rolled
to
his
elbows
came
from
behind
the
bar
and
talked
to
her
and
when
they
had
started
on
she
told
sam
of
her
plan
to
sell
her
home
and
buy
the
place
will
you
run
it
he
asked
sure
she
said
the
kids
can
take
care
of
at
the
end
of
a
little
street
of
a
half
dozen
neat
cottages
they
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
walked
with
uncertain
steps
along
a
sidewalk
skirting
a
high
bluff
and
overlooking
the
river
below
the
houses
a
tangled
mass
of
bushes
and
small
trees
lay
black
in
the
moonlight
and
in
the
distance
the
grey
body
of
the
river
showed
faint
and
far
away
the
undergrowth
was
so
thick
that
looking
down
one
saw
only
the
tops
of
the
growth
with
here
and
there
a
grey
outcrop
of
rocks
that
glistened
in
the
moonlight
up
a
flight
of
stone
steps
they
climbed
to
the
porch
of
one
of
the
houses
facing
the
river
the
woman
had
stopped
laughing
and
hung
heavily
on
sam
s
arm
her
feet
groping
for
the
steps
they
passed
through
a
door
and
into
a
long
room
an
open
stairway
at
the
side
of
the
room
went
up
to
the
floor
above
and
through
a
curtained
doorway
at
the
end
one
looked
into
a
small
a
rag
carpet
lay
on
the
floor
and
about
a
table
under
a
hanging
lamp
at
the
centre
sat
three
children
sam
looked
at
them
closely
his
head
reeled
and
he
clutched
at
the
knob
of
the
door
a
boy
of
perhaps
fourteen
with
freckles
on
his
face
and
on
the
backs
of
his
hands
and
with
hair
and
brown
eyes
was
reading
aloud
beside
him
a
younger
boy
with
black
hair
and
black
eyes
and
with
his
knees
doubled
up
on
the
chair
in
front
of
him
so
that
his
chin
rested
on
them
sat
listening
a
tiny
girl
pale
and
with
yellow
hair
and
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
slept
in
another
chair
her
head
hanging
uncomfortably
to
one
side
she
was
one
would
have
said
seven
the
boy
ten
the
boy
stopped
reading
and
looked
at
the
man
and
woman
the
sleeping
child
stirred
uneasily
in
her
chair
and
the
boy
straightened
out
his
legs
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
hello
mother
he
said
heartily
the
woman
walked
unsteadily
to
the
curtained
doorway
leading
into
the
and
pulled
aside
the
curtains
come
here
joe
she
said
the
boy
arose
and
went
toward
her
she
stood
aside
supporting
herself
with
one
hand
grasping
the
curtain
as
he
passed
she
struck
him
with
her
open
hand
on
the
back
of
the
head
sending
him
reeling
into
the
now
you
tom
she
called
to
the
boy
i
told
you
kids
to
wash
the
dishes
after
supper
and
to
put
mary
to
bed
here
it
is
past
ten
and
nothing
done
and
you
two
reading
books
the
boy
got
up
and
started
obediently
toward
her
but
sam
walked
rapidly
past
him
and
clutched
the
woman
by
the
arm
so
that
she
winced
and
twisted
in
his
grasp
you
come
with
me
he
said
he
walked
the
woman
across
the
room
and
up
the
stairs
she
leaned
heavily
on
his
arm
laughing
and
looking
up
into
his
face
at
the
top
of
the
stairway
he
stopped
we
go
in
here
she
said
pointing
to
a
door
he
took
her
into
the
room
you
get
to
sleep
he
said
and
going
out
closed
the
door
leaving
her
sitting
heavily
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
downstairs
he
found
the
two
boys
among
the
dishes
in
a
tiny
kitchen
off
the
the
little
girl
still
slept
uneasily
in
the
chair
by
the
table
the
hot
streaming
down
on
her
thin
cheeks
sam
stood
in
the
kitchen
door
looking
at
the
two
boys
who
looked
back
at
him
which
of
you
two
puts
mary
to
bed
he
asked
and
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
turned
to
the
taller
of
the
two
boys
let
tom
do
it
he
said
i
will
help
you
joe
and
sam
stood
in
the
kitchen
at
work
with
the
dishes
the
boy
going
busily
about
showed
the
man
where
to
put
the
clean
dishes
and
got
him
dry
wiping
towels
sam
s
coat
was
off
and
his
sleeves
rolled
up
the
work
went
on
in
half
awkward
silence
and
a
storm
went
on
within
sam
s
breast
when
the
boy
joe
looked
shyly
up
at
him
it
was
as
though
the
lash
of
a
whip
had
cut
down
across
flesh
suddenly
grown
tender
old
memories
began
to
stir
within
him
and
he
remembered
his
own
childhood
his
mother
at
work
among
other
people
s
soiled
clothes
his
father
windy
coming
home
drunk
and
the
chill
in
his
mother
s
heart
and
in
his
own
there
was
something
men
and
women
owed
to
childhood
not
because
it
was
childhood
but
because
it
was
new
life
springing
up
aside
from
any
question
of
fatherhood
or
motherhood
there
was
a
debt
to
be
paid
in
the
little
house
on
the
bluff
there
was
silence
outside
the
house
there
was
darkness
and
darkness
lay
over
sam
s
spirit
the
boy
joe
went
quickly
about
putting
the
dishes
sam
had
wiped
on
the
shelves
somewhere
on
the
river
far
below
the
house
a
steamboat
whistled
the
backs
of
the
hands
of
the
boy
were
covered
with
freckles
how
quick
and
competent
the
hands
were
here
was
new
life
as
yet
clean
unsoiled
unshaken
by
life
sam
was
shamed
by
the
trembling
of
his
own
hands
he
had
always
wanted
quickness
and
firmness
within
his
own
body
the
health
of
the
body
that
is
a
temple
for
the
health
of
the
spirit
he
was
an
american
and
down
deep
within
himself
was
the
moral
fervor
that
is
american
and
that
had
become
so
strangely
perverted
in
himself
and
others
as
so
often
happened
with
him
when
he
was
deeply
stirred
an
army
of
vagrant
thoughts
ran
through
his
head
the
thoughts
had
taken
the
place
of
the
perpetual
scheming
and
planning
of
his
days
as
a
man
of
affairs
but
as
yet
all
his
thinking
had
brought
him
to
nothing
and
had
only
left
him
more
shaken
and
uncertain
then
ever
the
dishes
were
now
all
wiped
and
he
went
out
of
the
kitchen
glad
to
escape
the
shy
silent
presence
of
the
boy
has
life
quite
gone
from
me
am
i
but
a
dead
thing
walking
about
he
asked
himself
the
presence
of
the
children
had
made
him
feel
that
he
was
himself
but
a
child
a
grown
tired
and
shaken
child
there
was
maturity
and
manhood
somewhere
abroad
why
could
he
not
come
to
it
why
could
it
not
come
into
him
the
boy
tom
returned
from
having
put
his
sister
into
bed
and
the
two
boys
said
good
night
to
the
strange
man
in
their
mother
s
house
joe
the
bolder
of
the
two
stepped
forward
and
offered
his
hand
sam
shook
it
solemnly
and
then
the
younger
boy
came
forward
i
ll
be
around
here
i
think
sam
said
huskily
the
boys
were
gone
into
the
silence
of
the
house
and
sam
walked
up
and
down
in
the
little
room
he
was
restless
as
though
about
to
start
on
a
new
journey
and
half
unconsciously
began
running
his
hands
over
his
body
wishing
it
strong
and
hard
as
when
he
tramped
the
road
as
on
the
day
when
he
had
walked
out
of
the
chicago
club
bound
on
his
hunt
for
truth
he
let
his
mind
go
so
that
it
played
freely
over
his
past
life
reviewing
and
analysing
for
hours
he
sat
on
the
porch
or
walked
up
and
down
in
the
room
where
the
lamp
still
burned
brightly
again
the
smoke
from
his
pipe
tasted
good
on
his
tongue
and
all
the
night
air
had
a
sweetness
that
brought
back
to
him
the
walk
beside
the
bridle
path
in
jackson
park
when
sue
had
given
him
herself
and
with
herself
a
new
impulse
in
life
it
was
two
o
clock
when
he
lay
down
upon
a
couch
in
the
and
blew
out
the
light
he
did
not
undress
but
threw
his
shoes
on
the
floor
and
lay
looking
at
a
wide
path
of
moonlight
that
came
through
the
open
door
in
the
darkness
it
seemed
that
his
mind
worked
more
rapidly
and
that
the
events
and
motives
of
his
restless
years
went
streaming
past
like
living
things
upon
the
floor
suddenly
he
sat
up
and
listened
the
voice
of
one
of
the
boys
heavy
with
sleep
ran
through
the
upper
part
of
the
house
mother
o
mother
called
the
sleepy
voice
and
sam
thought
he
could
hear
the
little
body
moving
restlessly
in
bed
silence
followed
he
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
couch
waiting
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
coming
to
something
that
his
brain
that
had
for
hours
been
working
more
and
more
rapidly
was
about
to
produce
the
thing
for
which
he
waited
he
felt
as
he
had
felt
that
night
as
he
waited
in
the
corridor
of
the
hospital
in
the
morning
the
three
children
came
down
the
stairs
and
finished
dressing
in
the
long
room
the
little
girl
coming
last
carrying
her
shoes
and
stockings
and
rubbing
her
eyes
with
the
back
of
her
hand
a
cool
morning
wind
blew
up
from
the
river
and
through
the
open
screened
doors
as
he
and
joe
cooked
breakfast
and
later
as
the
four
of
them
sat
at
the
table
sam
tried
to
talk
but
did
not
make
much
progress
his
tongue
was
heavy
and
the
children
seemed
looking
at
him
with
strange
questioning
eyes
why
are
you
here
their
eyes
asked
for
a
week
sam
stayed
in
the
city
coming
daily
to
the
house
with
the
children
he
talked
a
little
and
in
the
evening
when
the
mother
had
gone
away
the
little
girl
came
to
him
he
carried
her
to
a
chair
on
the
porch
outside
and
while
the
boys
sat
reading
under
the
lamp
inside
she
went
to
sleep
in
his
arms
her
body
was
warm
and
the
breath
came
softly
and
sweetly
from
between
her
lips
sam
looked
down
the
bluffside
and
saw
the
country
and
the
river
far
below
sweet
in
the
moonlight
tears
came
into
his
eyes
was
a
new
sweet
purpose
growing
within
him
or
were
the
tears
but
evidence
of
self
pity
he
wondered
one
night
the
woman
again
came
home
far
gone
in
drink
and
again
sam
led
her
up
the
stairs
to
see
her
fall
muttering
and
babbling
upon
the
bed
her
companion
a
little
flashily
dressed
man
with
a
beard
had
run
off
at
the
sight
of
sam
standing
in
the
under
the
lamp
the
two
boys
to
whom
he
had
been
reading
said
nothing
looking
at
the
book
upon
the
table
and
occasionally
out
of
the
corner
of
their
eyes
at
their
new
friend
in
a
few
minutes
they
too
went
up
the
stairs
and
as
on
that
first
night
they
put
out
their
hands
awkwardly
through
the
night
sam
again
sat
in
the
darkness
outside
or
lay
awake
on
the
couch
i
will
make
a
new
try
adopt
a
new
purpose
in
life
now
he
said
to
himself
when
the
children
had
gone
to
school
the
next
morning
sam
took
a
car
and
went
into
the
city
going
first
to
a
bank
to
have
a
large
draft
cashed
then
he
spent
many
busy
hours
going
from
store
to
store
and
buying
clothes
caps
soft
underwear
suit
cases
dresses
night
clothes
and
books
last
of
all
he
bought
a
large
dressed
doll
all
these
things
he
had
sent
to
his
room
at
the
hotel
leaving
a
man
there
to
pack
the
trunks
and
suit
cases
and
get
them
to
the
station
a
large
woman
an
employé
of
the
hotel
who
passed
through
the
hall
offered
to
help
with
the
packing
after
another
visit
or
two
sam
got
back
upon
the
car
and
went
again
to
the
house
in
his
pockets
he
had
several
thousands
of
dollars
in
large
bills
he
had
remembered
the
power
of
cash
in
deals
he
had
made
in
the
past
i
will
see
what
it
will
do
here
he
thought
in
the
house
sam
found
the
woman
lying
on
a
couch
in
the
as
he
came
in
at
the
door
she
arose
unsteadily
and
looked
at
him
there
s
a
bottle
in
the
cupboard
in
the
kitchen
she
said
get
me
a
drink
why
do
you
hang
about
here
sam
brought
the
bottle
and
poured
her
a
drink
pretending
to
drink
with
her
by
putting
the
bottle
to
his
lips
and
throwing
back
his
head
what
was
your
husband
like
he
asked
who
jack
she
said
oh
he
was
all
right
he
was
stuck
on
me
he
stood
for
anything
until
i
brought
men
home
here
then
he
got
crazy
and
went
she
looked
at
sam
and
laughed
i
didn
t
care
much
for
him
she
added
he
couldn
t
make
money
enough
for
a
live
sam
began
talking
of
the
saloon
she
intended
buying
the
children
will
be
a
bother
eh
he
said
i
have
an
offer
for
the
house
she
said
i
wish
i
didn
t
have
the
kids
they
are
a
i
have
been
figuring
that
out
sam
told
her
i
know
a
woman
in
the
east
who
would
take
them
and
raise
them
she
is
wild
about
kids
i
should
like
to
do
something
to
help
you
i
might
take
them
to
in
the
name
of
heaven
man
lead
them
away
she
laughed
and
took
another
drink
from
the
bottle
sam
drew
from
his
pocket
a
paper
he
had
secured
from
a
downtown
attorney
get
a
neighbour
in
here
to
witness
this
he
said
the
woman
will
want
things
regular
it
releases
you
from
all
responsibility
for
the
kids
and
puts
it
on
she
looked
at
him
suspiciously
what
s
the
graft
who
gets
stuck
for
the
fares
down
east
sam
laughed
and
going
to
the
back
door
shouted
to
a
man
who
sat
under
a
tree
back
of
the
next
house
smoking
a
pipe
sign
here
he
said
putting
the
paper
before
her
here
is
your
neighbour
to
sign
as
witness
you
do
not
get
stuck
for
a
the
woman
half
drunk
signed
the
paper
after
a
long
doubtful
look
at
sam
and
when
she
had
signed
and
had
taken
another
drink
from
the
bottle
lay
down
again
on
the
couch
if
any
one
wakes
me
up
for
the
next
six
hours
they
will
get
killed
she
declared
it
was
evident
she
knew
little
of
what
she
had
done
but
at
the
moment
sam
did
not
care
he
was
again
a
bargainer
ready
to
take
an
advantage
vaguely
he
felt
that
he
might
be
bargaining
for
an
end
in
life
for
purpose
to
come
into
his
own
life
sam
went
quietly
down
the
stone
steps
and
along
the
little
street
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
to
the
car
tracks
and
at
noon
was
waiting
in
an
automobile
outside
the
door
of
the
schoolhouse
when
the
children
came
out
he
drove
across
the
city
to
the
union
station
the
three
children
accepting
him
and
all
he
did
without
question
at
the
station
they
found
the
man
from
the
hotel
with
the
trunks
and
with
three
bright
new
suit
cases
sam
went
to
the
express
office
and
putting
several
bills
into
an
envelope
sealed
and
sent
it
to
the
woman
while
the
three
children
walked
up
and
down
in
the
train
shed
carrying
the
cases
aglow
with
the
pride
of
them
at
two
o
clock
sam
with
the
little
girl
in
his
arms
and
with
one
of
the
boys
seated
on
either
side
of

sam
mcpherson
is
a
living
american
he
is
a
rich
man
but
his
money
that
he
spent
so
many
years
and
so
much
of
his
energy
acquiring
does
not
mean
much
to
him
what
is
true
of
him
is
true
of
more
wealthy
americans
than
is
commonly
believed
something
has
happened
to
him
that
has
happened
to
the
others
also
to
how
many
of
the
others
men
of
courage
with
strong
bodies
and
quick
brains
men
who
have
come
of
a
strong
race
have
taken
up
what
they
had
thought
to
be
the
banner
of
life
and
carried
it
forward
growing
weary
they
have
stopped
in
a
road
that
climbs
a
long
hill
and
have
leaned
the
banner
against
a
tree
tight
brains
have
loosened
a
little
strong
convictions
have
become
weak
old
gods
are
dying
it
is
only
when
you
are
torn
from
your
mooring
and
drift
like
a
rudderless
ship
i
am
able
to
come
near
to
the
banner
has
been
carried
forward
by
a
strong
daring
man
filled
with
determination
what
is
inscribed
on
it
it
would
perhaps
be
dangerous
to
inquire
too
closely
we
americans
have
believed
that
life
must
have
point
and
purpose
we
have
called
ourselves
christians
but
the
sweet
christian
philosophy
of
failure
has
been
unknown
among
us
to
say
of
one
of
us
that
he
has
failed
is
to
take
life
and
courage
away
for
so
long
we
have
had
to
push
blindly
forward
roads
had
to
be
cut
through
our
forests
great
towns
must
be
built
what
in
europe
has
been
slowly
building
itself
out
of
the
fibre
of
the
generations
we
must
build
now
in
a
lifetime
in
our
father
s
day
at
night
in
the
forests
of
michigan
ohio
kentucky
and
on
the
wide
prairies
wolves
howled
there
was
fear
in
our
fathers
and
mothers
pushing
their
way
forward
making
the
new
land
when
the
land
was
conquered
fear
remained
the
fear
of
failure
deep
in
our
american
souls
the
wolves
still
howl
there
were
moments
after
sam
came
back
to
sue
bringing
the
three
children
when
he
thought
he
had
snatched
success
out
of
the
very
jaws
of
failure
but
the
thing
from
which
he
had
all
his
life
been
fleeing
was
still
there
it
hid
itself
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
that
lined
the
new
england
roads
where
he
went
to
walk
with
the
two
boys
at
night
it
looked
down
at
him
from
the
stars
perhaps
life
wanted
acceptance
from
him
but
he
could
not
accept
perhaps
his
story
and
his
life
ended
with
the
perhaps
it
began
then
the
was
not
in
itself
a
completely
happy
event
there
was
a
house
with
a
fire
at
night
and
the
voices
of
the
children
in
sam
s
breast
there
was
a
feeling
of
something
alive
growing
sue
was
generous
but
she
was
not
now
the
sue
of
the
bridle
path
in
jackson
park
in
chicago
or
the
sue
who
had
tried
to
remake
the
world
by
raising
fallen
women
on
his
arrival
at
her
house
on
a
summer
night
coming
in
suddenly
and
strangely
with
the
three
strange
children
a
little
inclined
toward
tears
and
homesickness
she
was
flustered
and
nervous
darkness
was
coming
on
when
he
walked
up
the
gravel
path
from
the
gate
to
the
house
door
with
the
child
mary
in
his
arms
and
the
two
boys
joe
and
tom
walking
soberly
and
solemnly
beside
him
sue
had
just
come
out
at
the
front
door
and
stood
regarding
them
startled
and
a
little
frightened
her
hair
was
becoming
grey
but
as
she
stood
there
sam
thought
her
figure
almost
boyish
in
its
slenderness
with
quick
generosity
she
threw
aside
the
inclination
in
herself
to
ask
many
questions
but
there
was
the
suggestion
of
a
taunt
in
the
question
she
did
ask
have
you
decided
to
come
back
to
me
and
is
this
your
she
asked
stepping
down
into
the
path
and
looking
not
at
sam
but
at
the
children
sam
did
not
answer
at
once
and
little
mary
began
to
cry
that
was
a
help
they
will
all
be
wanting
something
to
eat
and
a
place
to
sleep
he
said
as
though
coming
back
to
a
wife
long
neglected
and
bringing
with
him
three
strange
children
were
an
everyday
affair
although
she
was
puzzled
and
afraid
sue
smiled
and
led
the
way
into
the
house
lamps
were
lighted
and
the
five
human
beings
so
abruptly
brought
together
stood
looking
at
each
other
the
two
boys
clung
to
each
other
and
little
mary
put
her
arms
about
sam
s
neck
and
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
he
unloosed
her
clutching
hands
and
put
her
boldly
into
sue
s
arms
she
will
be
your
mother
now
he
said
defiantly
not
looking
at
sue
the
evening
was
got
through
blunderingly
by
himself
sam
thought
and
very
nobly
by
sue
there
was
the
mother
hunger
still
alive
in
her
he
had
shrewdly
counted
on
that
it
blinded
her
eyes
to
other
things
and
then
a
notion
had
come
into
her
head
and
there
seemed
the
possibility
of
doing
a
peculiarly
romantic
act
before
that
notion
was
destroyed
later
in
the
evening
both
sam
and
the
children
had
been
installed
in
the
house
a
tall
strong
negress
came
into
the
room
and
sue
gave
her
instructions
regarding
food
for
the
children
they
will
want
bread
and
milk
and
beds
must
be
found
for
them
she
said
and
then
although
her
mind
was
still
filled
with
the
romantic
notion
that
they
were
sam
s
children
by
some
other
woman
she
took
her
plunge
this
is
mcpherson
my
husband
and
these
are
our
three
children
she
announced
to
the
puzzled
and
smiling
servant
they
went
into
a
room
whose
windows
looked
into
a
garden
in
the
garden
an
old
negro
with
a
sprinkling
can
was
watering
flowers
a
little
light
yet
remained
both
sam
and
sue
were
glad
there
was
no
more
don
t
bring
lamps
a
candle
will
do
sue
said
and
she
went
to
stand
near
the
door
beside
her
husband
the
three
children
were
on
the
point
of
breaking
forth
into
sobs
but
the
negro
woman
with
a
quick
intuitive
sense
of
the
situation
began
to
chatter
striving
to
make
the
children
feel
at
home
she
awoke
wonder
and
hope
in
the
breasts
of
the
boys
there
is
a
barn
with
horses
and
cows
old
ben
will
show
you
everything
she
said
smiling
at
them
a
thick
grove
of
elm
and
maple
trees
stood
between
sue
s
house
and
a
road
that
went
down
a
hill
into
a
new
england
village
and
while
sue
and
the
negro
woman
put
the
children
to
bed
sam
went
there
to
wait
in
the
feeble
light
the
trunks
of
trees
could
be
dimly
seen
but
the
thick
branches
overhead
made
a
wall
between
him
and
the
sky
he
went
back
into
the
darkness
of
the
grove
and
then
returned
toward
the
open
space
before
the
house
he
was
nervous
and
distraught
and
two
sam
mcphersons
seemed
struggling
for
possession
of
his
person
there
was
the
man
he
had
been
taught
by
the
life
about
him
to
bring
always
to
the
surface
the
shrewd
capable
man
who
got
his
own
way
trampled
people
underfoot
went
plunging
forward
always
he
hoped
forward
the
man
of
achievement
and
then
there
was
another
personality
a
quite
different
being
altogether
buried
away
within
him
long
neglected
often
forgotten
a
timid
shy
destructive
sam
who
had
never
really
breathed
or
lived
or
walked
before
men
what
of
him
the
life
sam
had
led
had
not
taken
the
shy
destructive
thing
within
into
account
still
it
was
powerful
had
it
not
torn
him
out
of
his
place
in
life
made
of
him
a
homeless
wanderer
how
many
times
it
had
tried
to
speak
its
own
word
take
entire
possession
of
him
it
was
trying
again
now
and
again
and
from
old
habit
sam
fought
against
it
thrusting
it
back
into
the
dark
inner
caves
of
himself
back
into
darkness
he
kept
whispering
to
himself
perhaps
now
the
test
of
his
life
had
come
there
was
a
way
to
approach
life
and
love
there
was
sue
a
basis
for
love
and
understanding
might
be
found
with
her
later
the
impulse
could
be
carried
on
and
into
the
lives
of
the
children
he
had
found
and
brought
to
her
a
vision
of
himself
as
a
truly
humble
man
kneeling
before
life
kneeling
before
the
intricate
wonder
of
life
came
to
him
but
he
was
again
afraid
when
he
saw
sue
s
figure
dressed
in
white
a
dim
pale
flashing
thing
coming
down
steps
toward
him
he
wanted
to
run
away
to
hide
himself
in
the
darkness
and
he
wanted
also
to
run
toward
her
to
kneel
at
her
feet
not
because
she
was
sue
but
because
she
was
human
and
like
himself
filled
with
human
perplexities
he
did
neither
of
the
two
things
the
boy
of
caxton
was
still
alive
within
him
with
a
boyish
lift
of
the
head
he
went
boldly
to
her
nothing
but
boldness
will
answer
now
he
kept
saying
to
himself
they
walked
in
the
gravel
path
before
the
house
and
he
tried
lamely
to
tell
his
story
the
story
of
his
wanderings
of
his
seeking
when
he
came
to
the
tale
of
the
finding
of
the
children
she
stopped
in
the
path
and
stood
listening
pale
and
tense
in
the
half
light
then
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
nervously
half
hysterically
i
have
taken
them
and
you
of
course
she
said
after
he
had
stepped
to
her
and
had
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
my
life
alone
hasn
t
turned
out
to
be
a
very
inspiring
affair
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
take
them
and
you
in
the
house
there
the
two
years
you
have
been
gone
have
seemed
like
an
age
what
a
foolish
mistake
my
mind
has
made
i
thought
they
must
be
your
own
children
by
some
other
woman
some
woman
you
had
found
to
take
my
place
it
was
an
odd
notion
why
the
older
of
the
two
must
be
nearly
they
went
toward
the
house
the
negro
woman
having
at
sue
s
command
found
food
for
sam
and
respread
the
table
but
at
the
door
he
stopped
and
excusing
himself
stepped
again
into
the
darkness
under
the
trees
in
the
house
lamps
had
been
lighted
and
he
could
see
sue
s
figure
going
through
a
room
at
the
front
of
the
house
toward
the
presently
she
returned
and
pulled
the
shades
at
the
front
windows
a
place
was
being
prepared
for
him
inside
there
a
place
in
which
he
was
to
live
what
was
left
of
his
life
with
the
pulling
of
the
shades
darkness
dropped
down
over
the
figure
of
the
man
standing
just
within
the
grove
of
trees
and
darkness
dropped
down
over
the
inner
man
also
the
struggle
within
him
became
more
intense
could
he
surrender
to
others
live
for
others
there
was
the
house
darkly
seen
before
him
it
was
a
symbol
within
the
house
was
the
woman
sue
ready
and
willing
to
begin
the
task
of
rebuilding
their
lives
together
upstairs
in
the
house
now
were
the
three
children
three
children
who
must
begin
life
as
he
had
once
done
who
must
listen
to
his
voice
the
voice
of
sue
and
all
the
other
voices
they
would
hear
speaking
words
in
the
world
they
would
grow
up
and
thrust
out
into
a
world
of
people
as
he
had
done
to
what
end
there
was
an
end
sam
believed
that
stoutly
to
shift
the
load
to
the
shoulders
of
children
is
cowardice
he
whispered
to
himself
an
almost
overpowering
desire
to
turn
and
run
away
from
the
house
from
sue
who
had
so
generously
received
him
and
from
the
three
new
lives
into
which
he
had
thrust
himself
and
in
which
in
the
future
he
would
have
to
be
concerned
took
hold
of
him
his
body
shook
with
the
strength
of
it
but
he
stood
still
under
the
trees
i
can
not
run
away
from
life
i
must
face
it
i
must
begin
to
try
to
understand
these
other
lives
to
love
he
told
himself
the
buried
inner
thing
in
him
thrust
itself
up
how
still
the
night
had
become
in
the
tree
beneath
which
he
stood
a
bird
moved
on
some
slender
branch
and
there
was
a
faint
rustling
of
leaves
the
darkness
before
and
behind
was
a
wall
through
which
he
must
in
some
way
manage
to
thrust
himself
into
the
light
with
his
hand
before
him
as
though
trying
to
push
aside
some
dark
blinding
mass
he
moved
out
of
the
grove
and
thus
moving
stumbled
up
the
steps
and
into
the
house
the
end
