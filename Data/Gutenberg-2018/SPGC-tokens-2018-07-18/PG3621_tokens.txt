what
might

it
a

at

father
cahill
tightened
his
grasp
on
his
blackthorn
stick
and
shaking
it
in
the

face
said
do

the
man

meekly
bein

but
ye
wo
while
i
a
tongue
in

head
and
a
sthrong
stick
in
me
hand
looked
at
him
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
his
eyes
yer
eloquence
seems
to
nade
somethin
to
back
it
up
i
thinkin
father
cahill
breathed
hard
he
was
a
splendid
type
of
the
irish
of
the
old
school
gifted
with
a
vivid
power
of
eloquence
as
a
preacher
and
a
heart
as
tender
as
a
woman
toward
the
poor
and
the
wretched
he
had
been
for
many
years
idolised
by
the
whole
community
of
the
village
of
m
in
county
clare
but
of
late
there
was
a
growing
feeling
of
discontent
among
the
younger
generation
they
lacked
the
respect
their
elders
so
willingly
gave
they
asked
questions
instead
of
answering
them
they
began
to
throw
themselves
against
father
cahill
express
wishes
and
commands
into
the
fight
for
home
rule
under
the
masterly
statesmanship
of
charles
stuart
parnell
already
more
than
one
prominent
speaker
had
come
into
the
little
village
and
sown
the
seeds
of
temporal
and
spiritual
unrest
father
cahill
opposed
these
men
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
he
saw
as
so
many
priests
did
the
legacy
of
bloodshed
and
desolation
that
would
follow
any
direct
action
by
the
irish
against
the
british
government
though
the
blood
of
the
patriot
beat
in
father
veins
the
of
the
people
who
had
grown
up
with
him
was
near
to
his
heart
he
was
their
priest
and
he
could
not
bear
to
think
of
men
he
had
known
as
children
being
beaten
and
maimed
by
constabulary
and
sent
to
prison
afterwards
in
the
apparently
vain
fight
for
to
his
horror
that
day
he
met
frank
owen
one
of
the
most
notorious
of
all
the
younger
agitators
in
the
main
street
of
the
little
village
back
sliding
had
been
one
of
father
cahill
bitterest
regrets
he
had
closed
father
eyes
in
death
and
had
taken
care
of
the
boy
as
well
as
he
could
but
at
the
age
of
fifteen
the
youth
left
the
village
that
had
so
many
wretched
memories
of
hardship
and
struggle
and
worked
his
way
to
dublin
it
was
many
years
before
father
cahill
heard
of
him
again
he
had
developed
meanwhile
into
one
of
the
most
daring
of
all
the
fervid
speakers
in
the
sacred
cause
of
liberty
many
were
the
stories
told
of
his
narrow
escapes
from
death
and
imprisonment
he
always
had
the
people
on
his
side
and
once
away
from
the
hunt
he
would
hide
in
caves
or
in
mountains
until
the
hue
and
cry
was
over
and
then
appear
in
some
totally
unexpected
town
and
call
on
the
people
to
act
in
the
name
of
freedom
and
that
was
exactly
what
happened
on
this
particular
day
he
had
suddenly
appeared
in
the
town
he
was
born
in
and
called
a
meeting
on
kernan
hill
that
afternoon
it
was
this
meeting
father
cahill
was
determined
to
stop
by
every
means
in
his
power
he
could
hardly
believe
that
this
tall
bronzed
powerful
young
man
was
the
frank
he
had
watched
about
the
village
as
a
boy
pale
dejected
and
with
but
little
of
the
fire
of
life
in
him
now
as
he
stood
before
father
cahill
and
looked
him
straight
through
with
his
piercing
eye
shoulders
thrown
back
and
head
held
high
he
looked
every
inch
a
born
leader
of
men
and
just
for
a
moment
the
priest
quailed
but
only
for
a
moment
not
a
member
of
my
flock
will
attend
yer
meetin
not
a
door
will
open
this
day
ye
can
face
the
constabulary
yerself
and
the
few
of
the
rabble
that
follow
ye
but
none
of
my
people
will
risk
their
lives
and
their
liberty
to
listen
to
you
looked
at
him
strangely
a
glint
came
into
his
eye
and
the
suspicion
of
a
tear
as
he
answered
sure
it
precious
little
they
be
riskin
father
cahill
havin
no
liberty
and
their
lives
bein
of
little
account
to
them
sighed
as
the
thought
of
his
fifteen
years
of
withered
youth
in
that
poor
little
village
came
up
before
him
let
my
people
alone
i
tell
ye
cried
the
priest
it
contented
they
been
until
the
likes
of
you
came
amongst
us
then
they
must
have
been
easily
satisfied
retorted
to
judge
by
their
poor
little
homes
and
their
drab
little
lives
a
hovel
may
be
a
palace
if
the
divine
word
is
in
it
said
the
priest
sure
it
that
kind
of
tachin
keeps
ireland
the
mockery
of
the
whole
world
the
divine
word
should
bring
light
it
only
darkness
i
find
in
this
village
argued
i
given
my
life
to
spreadin
the
light
said
the
priest
a
smile
hovered
on
lips
as
he
muttered
faith
then
i
thinkin
it
must
be
a
yer
usin
yer
riverence
is
that
the
son
of
michael
talkin
suddenly
the
smile
left
lips
the
sneer
died
on
his
tongue
and
with
a
flash
of
power
that
turned
to
white
heat
before
he
finished
he
attacked
the
priest
with
yes
it
is
it
is
the
son
of
michael
who
died
on
the
roadside
and
was
buried
by
the
charity
of
his
neighbours
michael
born
in
the
image
of
god
who
lived
years
of
torment
and
starvation
and
sickness
and
misery
michael
who
was
thrown
out
from
a
bed
of
fever
by
order
of
his
landlord
to
die
in
sight
of
where
he
was
born
it
his
son
is
talkin
father
cahill
and
it
his
son
will
talk
while
there
breath
in
his
body
to
keep
his
tongue
waggin
it
a
precious
legacy
of
hatred
michael
left
his
son
and
there
no
priest
no
government
no
policeman
or
soldier
will
kape
that
son
from
spendin
his
legacy
the
man
trembled
from
head
to
foot
with
the
nervous
intensity
of
his
attack
everything
that
had
been
outraged
in
him
all
his
life
came
before
him
father
cahill
began
to
realise
as
he
watched
him
the
secret
of
the
tremendous
appeal
the
man
had
to
the
suffering
people
just
for
a
moment
the
priest
heart
went
out
to
agitator
though
he
was
your
father
died
with
all
the
comforts
of
the
holy
church
said
the
priest
gently
as
he
put
his
old
hand
the
young
man
shoulder
the
comforts
of
the
church
scoffed
praise
be
to
heaven
for
that
he
laughed
a
grim
derisive
laugh
as
he
went
on
sure
it
the
fine
choice
the
irish
peasant
has
and
dirt
are
good
enough
for
them
to
eat
sez
the
british
government
them
prayers
say
the
priests
and
so
they
die
like
flies
in
the
highways
and
hedges
but
with
the
comforts
of
the
holy
church
father
cahill
voice
thrilled
with
indignation
as
he
said
i
not
stand
and
listen
to
ye
talk
that
way
frank
i
often
noticed
that
those
who
are
the
first
to
preach
truth
are
the
last
to
listen
to
it
said
the
agitator
drily
where
would
ireland
be
but
for
the
priest
answer
me
that
where
would
she
be
what
has
my
a
here
been
i
accepted
the
yoke
of
the
church
when
i
was
scarcely
your
age
i
given
my
life
to
serving
it
to
help
the
poor
and
to
keep
faith
and
love
for
him
in
their
hearts
to
tache
the
little
children
and
bring
them
up
in
the
way
of
god
baptised
them
when
their
eyes
first
looked
out
on
this
wurrld
of
sorrows
i
given
them
in
marriage
closed
their
eyes
in
death
and
read
the
last
message
to
him
for
their
souls
and
there
are
thousands
more
like
me
giving
their
lives
to
their
little
missions
trying
to
kape
the
people
hearts
clean
and
honest
so
that
their
souls
may
go
to
him
when
their
journey
is
ended
father
cahill
took
a
deep
breath
as
he
finished
he
had
indeed
summed
up
his
life
work
he
had
given
it
freely
to
his
poor
little
flock
his
only
happiness
had
been
in
ministering
to
their
needs
and
now
to
have
one
to
whom
he
had
taught
his
first
prayer
heard
his
first
confession
and
given
him
his
first
holy
communion
speak
scoffingly
of
the
priest
hurt
him
as
nothing
else
could
hurt
and
bruise
him
the
appeal
was
not
lost
on
in
his
heart
he
loved
father
cahill
for
the
life
of
he
had
passed
in
this
little
place
but
in
his
brain
pitied
the
old
man
for
his
wasted
years
in
the
darkness
of
ignorance
in
which
so
many
of
the
villages
of
ireland
seemed
to
be
buried
belonged
to
the
young
ireland
movement
they
wanted
to
bring
the
searchlight
of
knowledge
into
the
abodes
of
darkness
in
which
the
poor
of
ireland
were
submerged
to
the
younger
men
it
seemed
the
priests
were
keeping
the
people
from
enlightenment
and
until
the
fierce
blaze
of
criticism
could
be
turned
on
to
the
government
of
cruelty
and
oppression
there
was
small
hope
of
freeing
the
people
who
had
suffered
so
long
in
silence
was
in
the
front
band
of
men
striving
to
arouse
the
sleeping
nation
to
a
sense
of
its
own
power
and
nothing
was
going
to
stop
the
onward
movement
it
pained
him
to
differ
from
father
cahill
the
one
friend
of
his
youth
if
only
he
could
alter
the
good
priest
outlook
win
him
over
to
the
great
procession
that
was
marching
surely
and
firmly
to
freedom
of
speech
and
of
action
and
to
the
ultimate
making
of
men
of
force
out
of
the
crushed
and
the
hopeless
he
would
try
father
cahill
he
began
softly
as
though
the
good
priest
might
be
wooed
by
sweet
reason
when
the
declamatory
force
of
the
orator
failed
do
ye
think
it
would
be
wiser
to
attend
a
little
more
to
the
people
bodies
than
to
their
souls
to
their
brains
rather
than
to
their
hearts
do
ye
no
i
do
not
hotly
answered
the
priest
well
if
ye
did
said
the
agitator
if
more
priests
did
it
a
different
ireland
we
be
livin
in
that
we
would
the
christian
heaven
seems
so
far
away
when
he
livin
in
hell
try
to
make
earth
more
like
a
heaven
and
he
be
more
apt
to
listen
to
stories
of
the
other
one
tache
them
to
kape
their
hovels
clean
and
their
hearts
and
lives
will
have
a
betther
chance
of
health
above
all
broaden
their
minds
give
them
education
and
the
divine
tachin
will
find
a
surer
restin
place
ignorance
and
dirt
fill
the
hospitals
and
the
asylums
and
it
is
that
so
many
of
the
priests
are
fosterin
i
not
listen
to
another
wurrd
cried
father
cahill
turning
away
strode
in
front
of
him
wait
there
another
thing
i
heard
more
than
one
priest
boast
that
there
was
less
sin
in
the
villages
of
ireland
than
in
any
other
country
and
why
what
is
yer
great
cure
for
vice
marriage
is
it
what
are
ye
sayin
i
sayin
this
father
cahill
if
a
boy
looks
at
a
girl
twice
what
do
ye
do
engage
them
to
be
married
to
you
marriage
is
the
safeguard
against
sin
and
what
are
such
marriages
hunger
marryin
thirst
poverty
united
to
misery
men
and
women
ignorant
and
stunted
in
mind
and
body
bound
together
by
a
sacrament
givin
them
the
right
to
bring
others
equally
distorted
into
the
wurrld
and
when
they
born
you
baptise
them
and
you
have
more
souls
entered
on
the
great
register
for
the
holy
church
bodies
livin
in
perpetual
torment
with
a
heaven
wavin
at
them
all
through
their
lives
as
a
reward
for
their
suffering
here
i
tell
ye
ye
wrong
ye
wrong
ye
wrong
the
misery
of
such
marriages
will
reach
through
all
the
generations
to
come
rather
see
vice
vice
that
burns
out
and
leaves
the
lives
it
scorches
there
is
more
sin
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
these
poor
wretched
people
than
in
the
sinks
of
europe
there
is
some
hope
for
the
vicious
intelligence
and
will
wean
them
from
it
but
there
is
no
hope
for
the
people
whose
lives
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
are
drab
and
empty
and
sordid
and
wretched
as
uttered
this
terrible
arraignment
of
the
old
order
of
protecting
society
by
early
and
indiscriminate
marriages
it
seemed
as
if
the
mantle
of
some
modern
prophet
had
fallen
on
him
he
had
struck
at
the
real
keynote
of
ireland
misery
the
spirit
of
oppression
followed
them
into
the
privacy
of
their
lives
even
their
wives
were
chosen
for
them
by
their
teachers
small
wonder
the
english
government
could
enforce
brutal
and
unjust
laws
when
the
very
freedom
of
choosing
their
mates
and
of
having
any
voice
in
the
control
of
their
own
homes
was
denied
them
to
father
cahill
such
words
were
blasphemy
he
looked
at
in
horror
have
ye
done
he
asked
what
else
i
may
have
to
say
will
be
said
on
kernan
hill

afternoon

we
outnumber
them
ten
to
one
there
be
riotin
and

better
to
die
in
a
good
cause
than
to
live
in
a
bad
one
cried
it
the
great
dead
who
lead
the
world
by
their
majesty

the
bad
livin

back
by
their
infamy

i

name
of
the
church
in
which

only
the
voice
of
my
dead

father
voice
is
louder
than
yours
father
cahill
have
an
old
man
tears
no
power
to
move
ye
looked
at
the
priest
tears
were
streaming
down
his
cheeks
he
made
no
effort
to
staunch
them
hesitated
then
he
said
firmly
my
father
wept
in
the
ditch
when
he
was
dyin
dying
in
sight
of
his
home
mine
was
the
only
hand
that
wiped
away
his
tears
i
can
see
only
his
father
i
make
my
last
appeal
what
good
can
this
meetin
do
ye
say
the
people

ignorant
and
wretched
why
have
them
batthered
and
shot
down
by
the
soldiers
it
has
always
been
the
martyrs
who
have
made
a
cause
i
am
willin
to
be
one
i

a
thraitor
if

i
would
be
the
first
and
i
wo

the
last
nothing

ye
cried
the
priest
one
thing
only
replied
the
agitator
and
what
is
that
death
and
strode
abruptly
away
chapter
ii
the
panorama
of
a
lost
youth
as
hurried
through
the
streets
of
the
little
village
thoughts
surged
madly
through
his
brain
it
was
in
this
barren
spot
he
was
born
and
passed
his
youth
youth
a
period
of
poverty
and
struggle
of
empty
dreams
and
futile
hopes
it
passed
before
him
now
as
a
panorama
there
was
the
doctor
house
where
his
father
hurried
the
night
he
was
born
how
often
had
his
mother
told
him
of
that
night
of
storm
when
she
gave
her
last
gleam
of
strength
in
giving
him
life
in
storm
he
was
born
in
strife
he
would
live
the
mark
was
on
him
now
he
came
to
the
little
schoolhouse
where
he
first
learned
to
read
facing
it
father
cahill
tiny
church
where
he
had
learned
to
pray
beyond
lay
the
green
on
which
he
had
his
first
fight
it
was
about
his
father
bruised
and
bleeding
he
crept
home
that
day
beaten
his
mother
cried
over
him
and
washed
his
cuts
and
bathed
his
bruises
a
flush
of
shame
crept
across
his
face
as
he
thought
of
that
beating
the
result
of
our
first
battle
stays
with
us
through
life
he
watched
his
conqueror
he
remembered
for
years
he
had
but
one
ambition
in
those
days
to
gain
sufficient
strength
to
wipe
out
that
disgrace
he
trained
his
muscles
he
ran
on
the
roads
at
early
morning
until
his
breathing
was
good
he
made
friends
with
an
english
soldier
stationed
in
the
town
by
doing
him
some
slight
service
the
man
had
learned
boxing
in
london
and
could
beat
any
one
in
his
regiment
asked
the
man
to
teach
him
boxing
the
soldier
agreed
he
found
the
boy
an
apt
pupil
mastered
the
art
of
he
learned
the
vulnerable
points
of
attack
then
he
waited
his
opportunity
one
when
the
schoolboys
were
playing
on
the
green
he
walked
up
deliberately
to
his
conqueror
and
challenged
him
to
a
return
engagement
the
boys
crowded
around
them
is
it
another
batin
ye
be
afther
havin
ye
son
said
the
enemy
reply
was
a
punch
on
that
youth
jaw
and
the
second
battle
was
on
as
fought
he
remembered
every
blow
of
the
first
fight
when
weak
and
unskilful
he
was
an
easy
prey
for
his
victor
that
for
the
one
ye
gave
me
two
years
ago
martin
quinlan
cried
as
he
closed
that
youth
right
eye
and
stepped
nimbly
back
from
a
furious
counter
and
it
a
bloody
nose
ye
have
too
as
he
drove
his
left
with
deadly
precision
on
quinlan
olfactory
organ
staggering
that
amazed
youth
who
nothing
daunted
ran
into
a
series
of
jabs
and
swings
that
completely
dazed
him
and
forced
him
to
clinch
to
save
further
damage
but
the
fighting
blood
of
was
up
he
beat
quinlan
out
of
the
clinch
with
a
that
put
the
youth
upon
his
back
on
the
green
now
take
back
that
son
shouted
i
not
from
the
grass
then
get
up
and
be
beaten
screamed
the
boys
danced
around
them
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
quinlan
had
thrashed
them
all
and
here
was
the
apparently
weakest
of
them
thrashing
him
why
if
could
best
him
they
all
could
the
reign
of
tyranny
was
over
fight
fight
they
shouted
as
they
crowded
around
the
combatants
quinlan
rose
to
his
feet
only
to
be
put
back
again
on
the
ground
by
a
straight
right
in
the
mouth
he
felt
the
warm
blood
against
his
lips
and
tasted
the
salt
on
his
tongue
it
maddened
him
he
staggered
up
and
rushed
with
all
his
force
against
who
stepped
aside
and
caught
quinlan
as
he
stumbled
past
full
behind
the
ear
he
pitched
forward
on
his
face
and
did
not
move
the
battle
was
over
and
i
serve
just
the
same
any
that
sez
a
word
against
me
father
not
a
boy
said
a
word
fighting
he
was
nicknamed
that
day
and
fighting
he
was
known
years
afterwards
to
dublin
castle
when
he
showed
his
mother
his
bruised
knuckles
that
night
and
told
her
how
he
came
by
them
she
cried
again
as
she
did
two
years
before
only
this
time
they
were
tears
of
pride
from
door
to
door
he
went
kernan
hill
at
three
was
all
he
said
some
nodded
some
said
nothing
others
agreed
volubly
on
all
their
faces
he
read
that
they
would
be
there
on
through
the
village
he
went
until
he
reached
the
outskirts
he
paused
and
looked
around
there
was
the
spot
on
which
the
little
cabin
he
was
born
in
and
in
which
his
mother
died
had
stood
it
had
long
since
been
pulled
down
for
improvements
not
a
sign
to
mark
the
tomb
of
his
youth
it
was
here
they
placed
his
father
that
bleak
november
day
here
by
the
ditch
it
was
here
his
father
gave
up
the
struggle
the
feeble
pulse
ebbed
the
flame
died
out
the
years
stripped
back
it
seemed
as
yesterday
and
here
he
stood
grown
to
manhood
he
needed
just
that
reminder
to
stir
his
blood
and
nerve
him
for
the
ordeal
of
kernan
hill
the
old
order
was
dying
out
in
ireland
the
days
of
spiritless
bending
to
the
yoke
were
over
it
was
a
young
ireland
he
belonged
to
and
meant
to
lead
a
young
ireland
with
an
inheritance
of
oppression
and
slavery
to
wipe
out
a
young
ireland
that
demanded
to
be
heard
that
meant
to
act
that
would
fight
step
by
step
in
the
march
to
westminster
to
compel
recognition
of
their
just
claims
and
he
was
to
be
one
of
their
leaders
he
squared
his
shoulders
as
he
looked
for
the
last
time
on
the
little
spot
of
earth
that
once
meant
home
to
him
he
took
in
a
deep
breath
and
muttered
through
his
clenched
teeth
let
the
march
begin
forward
and
he
turned
toward
kernan
hill
chapter
iii
kernan
hill
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
climbed
up
men
women
and
children
the
men
grimy
and
a
look
of
hopelessness
in
their
eyes
the
sob
of
misery
in
their
voices
dragging
themselves
up
after
them
came
the
women
some
pressing
babies
to
their
breasts
others
leading
little
children
by
the
hand
the
men
had
begged
them
to
stay
at
home
there
might
be
bad
work
that
day
but
the
women
had
answered
if
we
go
they
wo
hurt
you
and
they
pressed
on
after
the
leaders
at
three
ascended
the
hill
and
stood
alone
on
the
great
mount
a
cry
of
greeting
went
up
he
raised
his
hand
in
acknowledgment
it
was
strange
indeed
for
him
to
stand
there
looking
down
at
the
people
he
had
known
since
childhood
a
thousand
conflicting
emotions
swept
through
him
as
he
looked
at
the
men
and
women
whom
only
a
little
while
ago
it
seemed
he
had
known
as
children
then
he
bent
to
their
will
the
son
of
a
peasant
he
was
amongst
the
poorest
of
the
poor
now
he
came
amongst
them
to
try
and
lift
them
from
the
depths
he
had
risen
from
himself
it
is
frankie
himself
cried
a
voice
him
we
knew
as
a
baby
said
another
fightin
hooray
for
him
shouted
a

child
standin
up
there
tall
and
straight
to

freedom
and
comfort
crooned
an
old
woman
and

said
another

woman
and
lyin
in
the
himself
mebbe
this
night
said
a
third
the
lord
be
with
him
cried
a
fourth
amen
to
that
and
they
reverently
crossed
themselves
again
raised
his
hand
this
time
to
command
silence
all
the
murmurs
died
away
began
his
rich
melodious
voice
ringing
far
beyond
the
farthest
limits
of
the
crowd
the
music
of
his
irish
brogue
making
cadences
of
entreaty
and
again
lashing
the
people
into
fury
at
the
memory
of
ireland
wrongs
irish
men
and
women
we
are
met
here
in
the
sight
of
god
and
in
defiance
of
the
english
government
groans
and
hisses
to
clasp
hands
to
unite
our
thoughts
and
to
nerve
our
bodies
to
the
supreme
effort
of
bringing
hope
to
despair
freedom
to
slavery
prosperity
to
the

satisfied
with
this
angry
cries
of
no

think
of

hovels
scorched
with
the
heat
blisthered
with
the
wind
and
drenched
with
the
rain
to

with

aching
for
their
homes
and
their
loved
ones
the
fault
is
at
our

door
the
solution
is
in
our
own
hands
is
it
betther
to
die
pike

fightin
as

did
than
to
rot
in
filth
and
die
lavin
a
legacy
of
disease
and
pestilence
and
weak
brains
and
famished
bodies
his
voice
cracked
and
broke
into
a
hysterical
cry
as
he
finished
the
peroration
a
flame
leaped
through
the
mob
the
men
muttered
imprecations
as
a
new
light
flashed
from
their
eyes
all
their
misery
fell
from
them
as
a
shroud
they
only
thought
of
vengeance
they
were
men
again
their
hearts
beat
as
their
progenitors
hearts
must
have
beaten
at
the
boyne
the
great
upheaval
that
flashed
through
ireland
from
epoch
to
epoch
burned
like
vitriol
in
their
veins
the
women
forgot
their
crying
babies
as
they
pressed
forward
screaming
their
paean
of
vengeance
against
their
oppressors
the
crowd
seemed
to
throb
as
some
great
engine
of
humanity
it
seemed
to
think
with
one
brain
beat
with
one
heart
and
call
with
one
voice
the
cry
grew
into
an
angry
roar
suddenly
father
cahill
appeared
amongst
them

commanded
breathlessly

swear
to
give
yer
lives
so
that
the
generations
to
come
may
know
happiness
and
peace
and
freedom
swear
he
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
adjuration
his
right
hand
held
high
above
his
head
his
left
palm
upward
stretched
forward
in
an
attitude
of
entreaty
it
seemed
as
though
the
soul
of
the
man
was
pleading
with
them
to
take
the
oath
that
would
bind
their
souls
to
the
cause
crowding
around
him
eyes
blazing
breasts
heaving
as
if
impelled
by
one
common
thought
the
men
and
women
clamoured
with
outstretched
hands
we
swear
in
that
moment
of
exaltation
it
seemed
as
if
the
old
halo
glowed
over
each
as
they
took
the
oath
that
pledged
them
to
the
cause
the
cause
that
meant
the
lifting
of
oppression
and
tyranny
immunity
from
buckshot
and
the
from
famine
and
murder
and
coercion
all
the
component
parts
of
ireland
torture
in
her
struggle
for
her
right
to
a
moment
later
the
crowd
was
hushed
a
tremour
ran
through
it
the
sounds
of
marching
troops
the
unintelligible
words
of
command
broke
in
on
them
father
cahill
plunged
in
amongst
them
the
constabulary
he
cried
back
to
your
homes
stay
where
you
are
shouted
i
beg
you
my
children
i
command
you
i
entreat
you
do
have
bloodshed

father
cahill
turned
distractedly
to
crying
out
to
him
tell
them
to
go
back
my
poor
people
tell
them
to
go
back
to
their
homes
while
there
time
turning
his
back
on
the
priest
faced
the
crowd
you
have
taken
your
oath
would
you
perjure
yourselves
at
this
old
man
bidding
see
where
the
soldiers
come
look
and
look
well
at
them
their
uniforms
stand
for
the
badge
of
tyranny
the
glint
of
their
muskets
is
the
message
from
their
illustrious
sovereign
of
her
feeling
to
this
part
of
her
kingdom
we
ask
for
justice
and
they
send
us
bullets
we
cry
for
and
the
answer
is
at
the
hands
of
her
soldiers
we
accept
the
challenge
put
yer
women
and
childhren
behind
you
let
no
man
move
the
men
hurriedly
placed
the
women
and
children
so
that
they
were
protected
from
the
first
onslaught
of
the
soldiery
then
the
men
of
kernan
hill
armed
with
huge
stones
and
sticks
turned
to
meet
the
troops

at
their

cried

to
an
angry

from

he
given
the
police
the
slip
in
many
parts
of
the
country
he
wo
the
magistrate
pushed
forward
on
his
horse
through
the
fringe
on
the
front
part
of
the
crowd
and
reined
up
at
the
foot
of
the
mount

called
up

me
yerself
magistrate
roche
replied
turning
to
an
officer
roche
motioned
him
to
seize
as
the
officer
pressed
forward
he
was
felled
by
a
blow
from
a
heavy
stick
in
a
second
the
fight
was
on
the
magistrate
read
the
he
together
with
father
cahill
called
to
the
mob
to
stop
they
shouted
to
to
surrender
and
disperse
the
people
too
late
the
soldiers
formed
into
open
formation
and
marched
on
the
mob
maddened
and
reeling
with
no
order
no
discipline
with
only
blind
fury
and
the
rushing
pulsing
blood
that
has
won
many
a
battle
for
england
against
a
common
foe
the
men
of
ireland
hurled
themselves
upon
the
soldiers
they
threw
their
missiles
they
struck
them
with
their
gnarled
sticks
they
beat
them
with
their
clenched
fists
the
order
to
fire
was
given
as
the
soldiers
fell
back
from
the
onslaught
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
the
ranks
of
the
mob
were
broken
some
lay
dead
on
the
turf
some
groaned
in
the
agony
of
shattered
limbs
the
women
threw
themselves
moaning
on
the
bodies
silence
fell
like
a
pall
over
the
mob
out
of
the
silence
a
low
angry
growl
went
up
had
fallen
too
the
soldiers
surrounded
his
prostrate
body
the
mob
made
a
rush
forward
to
rescue
him
stopped
them
with
a
cry
enough
for
my
men
he
pointed
to
the
wounded
and
dying
live
to
avenge
them
wait
until
day
his
voice
failed
he
fell
back
unconscious
into
the
midst
of
the
crowd
and
through
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
suddenly
rode
a
young
girl
barely
twenty
years
old
beside
her
was
a
terrified
groom
she
guided
her
horse
straight
to
the
magistrate
he
raised
his
hat
and
muttered
a
greeting
with
a
glance
of
recognition
have
him
taken
to
gap
she
said
imperatively
pointing
to
the
motionless
body
of
he
is
under
arrest
replied
the
magistrate
do
you
want
another
death
on
your
hands
have
you
done
enough
in
killing
and
maiming
those
unfortunate
people
she
looked
with
pity
on
the
moaning
women
and
then
with
contempt
on
the
officer
who
gave
the
order
to
fire
you
ought
to
be
proud
of
your
work
she
said
i
only
carried
out
my
orders
replied
the
man
humbly
have
that
man
taken
to
my
brother
house
he
will
surrender
him
or
go
bail
for
him
until
he
has
been
attended
to
first
let
us
save
him
the
girl
dismounted
and
made
a
litter
of
some
fallen
branches
assisted
by
the
groom
order
some
of
your
men
to
carry
him
there
was
a
note
of
command
in
her
tone
that
awed
both
the
officer
and
the
magistrate
four
men
were
detailed
to
carry
the
body
on
the
litter
the
girl
remounted
turning
to
the
magistrate
she
said
tell
your
government
roche
that
their
soldiers
shot
down
these
unarmed
people
then
she
wheeled
round
to
the
mob
go
back
to
your
homes
she
pointed
to
the
dead
and
wounded
they
have
died
or
been
maimed
for
their
cause
do
as
he
said
pointing
to
the
unconscious
live
for
it
she
started
down
through
the
valley
followed
by
the
and
the
magistrate
the
officer
gave
the
word
of
command
and
with
some
of
the
ringleaders
in
their
midst
the
soldiers
marched
away
left
alone
with
their
dying
and
their
dead
all
the
ferocity
left
the
poor
crushed
peasants
they
knelt
down
sobbing
over
the
motionless
bodies
for
the
time
being
the
law
and
its
officers
were
triumphant
this
was
the
act
of
the
representatives
of
the
english
government
in
the
year
of
civilisation
and
in
the

chapter
iv
nathaniel
kingsnorth
visits
ireland
while
the
incidents
of
the
foregoing
chapters
were
taking
place
the
gentleman
whose
ownership
shaped
the
destinies
of
many
of
the
agitators
of
kernan
hill
was
confronting
almost
as
difficult
a
problem
as
was
facing
on
the
mount
whilst
was
pleading
for
the
right
of
ireland
to
govern
herself
nathaniel
kingsnorth
was
endeavouring
to
understand
how
to
manage
so
unwieldy
and
so
troublesome
an
estate
the
death
of
his
father
placed
a
somewhat
extensive
and
so
far
entirely
unprofitable
portion
of
the
village
in
his
care
his
late
father
had
complained
all
his
life
of
the
depreciation
of
values
the
growing
reluctance
to
pay
rents
and
the
general
of
the
worth
of
an
estate
that
had
passed
into
the
hands
of
a
kingsnorth
many
generations
before
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
for
notes
that
had
not
been
taken
up
and
mortgages
that
had
been
foreclosed
it
was
the
open
boast
of
the
old
gentleman
that
he
had
never
seen
the
village
and
it
was
one
of
his
dying
gratifications
that
he
would
never
have
to
he
had
all
the
racial
antipathy
of
a
certain
type
of
englishmen
to
anything
irish
the
word
itself
was
unpleasant
to
his
ears
he
never
heard
it
without
a
shudder
and
his
intimates
at
his
request
refrained
from
using
it
in
his
presence
the
word
represented
to
him
all
that
was
unsavoury
unpatriotic
and
unprincipled
one
phrase
of
his
in
speaking
of
ireland
at
a
banquet
achieved
the
dignity
of
being
printed
in
all
the
great
london
daily
papers
and
was
followed
by
a
splenetic
attack
in
the
irish
nation
both
incidents
pleased
the
old
gentleman
beyond
measure
it
was
an
unfailing
source
of
gratification
to
him
that
he
had
coined
the
historical
utterance
he
quoted
it
with
a
grim
chuckle
on
the
few
occasions
when
some
guest
unfamiliar
with
his
prejudice
would
mention
in
his
presence
the
hated
word
ireland
it
appears
that
one
particularly
hard
winter
when
for
some
unnecessary
and
wholly
unwarrantable
reason
the
potato
crop
had
failed
and
the
little
irish
village
was
in
a
condition
of
desperate
distress
it
was
found
impossible
to
collect
more
than
a
tithe
of
kingsnorth
just
dues
no
persuasion
could
make
the
obstinate
tenants
pay
their
rents
threats
evictions
all
were
useless
they
simply
would
not
pay
his
agent
finally
admitted
himself
beaten
kingsnorth
must
wait
for
better
times
furious
at
his
diminished
income
and
hating
with
a
bitter
hatred
the
disloyal
and
cheating
tenantry
he
rose
at
a
guildhall
banquet
to
reply
to
the
toast
of
the
colonies
he
drew
vivid
pictures
of
the
splendour
of
the
british
possessions
of
india
that
golden
and
loyal
empire
australia
with
its
hidden
mines
of
wealth
whose
soil
had
scarce
been
scratched
peopled
by
patriotic
zealous
and
toiling
millions
honestly
paying
their
way
through
life
by
the
sweat
of
their
brows
what
an
example
to
the
world
a
country
where
the
hurried
with
eager
footsteps
to
place
the
honestly
earned
tolls
at
the
feet
of
generous
and
trusting
landlords
then
on
the
other
hand
he
pointed
to
that
small
portion
of
the
british
isles
where
to
pay
rent
was
a
crime
where
landlords
were
but
targets
for
insult
and
vituperation
yes
and
indeed
for
bullets
from
the
hidden
assassin
whenever
they
were
indiscreet
enough
to
visit
a
country
where
laws
existed
but
that
they
might
be
broken
and
crime
stalked
fearlessly
through
the
land
such
a
condition
was
a
reproach
to
the
english
government
why
he
asked
the
astonished
gathering
of
dignitaries
why
should
such
a
condition
exist
when
three
hundred
and
men
sat
in
the
house
of
commons
sent
there
by
electors
to
administer
the
just
and
wise
laws
of
a
just
and
wise
country
why
as
he
paused
and
glared
around
the
table
for
the
reply
that
was
not
forthcoming
the
undying
phrase
sprang
from
his
lips
oh
he
cried
oh
that
for
one
brief
hour
providence
would
immerse
that
island
of
discontent
beneath
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
and
destroy
a
people
who
seemed
bent
on
destroying
themselves
and
on
disintegrating
the
majesty
and
dignity
and
honour
of
our
great
empire
feeling
that
no
words
of
his
could
follow
so
marvellous
a
climax
he
sat
down
amid
a
silence
that
seemed
to
him
to
be
fraught
with
eloquence
so
impressive
and
significant
was
to
him
its
full
meaning
some
speeches
are
cheered
vulgarly
it
was
the
outward
sign
of
coarse
approval
others
are
enjoyed
and
sympathised
with
inwardly
and
the
outward
tribute
to
which
was
silence
and
that
was
the
tribute
of
that
particular
guildhall
gathering
on
that
great
night
it
seemed
to
wilberforce
kingsnorth
hardened
speaker
though
he
was
that
never
had
a
body
of
men
such
as
he
confronted
and
who
met
his
gaze
by
dropping
their
eyes
modestly
to
their
glasses
been
so
genuinely
thrilled
by
so
original
so
comprehensive
and
so
dramatic
a
conclusion
to
a
powerful
appeal
kingsnorth
felt
as
he
sat
down
that
it
was
indeed
a
night
for
him
and
for
england
the
times
in
reviewing
the
speeches
the
following
morning
significantly
commented
that
kingsnorth
had
solved
in
a
moment
of
entreaty
to
a
hitherto
indifferent
providence
the
entire
irish
difficulty
when
nathaniel
kingsnorth
found
himself
the
fortunate
possessor
of
this
tract
of
land
peopled
by
so
lawless
a
race
he
determined
to
see
for
himself
what
the
conditions
really
were
so
for
the
first
time
since
they
owned
a
portion
of
it
a
kingsnorth
set
foot
on
irish
soil
accompanied
by
his
two
sisters
he
arrived
quietly
some
few
weeks
before
and
addressed
himself
at
once
to
the
task
of
understanding
the
people
and
the
circumstances
in
which
they
lived
on
this
particular
afternoon
he
was
occupied
with
his
agent
going
systematically
through
the
details
of
the
management
of
the
estate
it
was
indeed
a
discouraging
prospect
such
a
condition
of
pauperism
seemed
incredible
in
a
village
within
a
few
hours
of
his
own
england
except
for
a
few
moderately
thriving
tradesmen
the
whole
population
seemed
to
live
from
hand
to
mouth
the
entire
village
was
in
debt
they
owed
the
landlords
the
tradesmen
they
even
owed
each
other
money
and
goods
it
seemed
to
be
a
community
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
in
which
nothing
from
the
outside
ever
entered
no
money
was
ever
put
into
the
village
on
the
contrary
there
was
a
continuous
withdrawal
by
present
standards
a
day
would
come
when
the
last
coin
would
depart
and
the
favoured
spot
would
be
as
independent
of
money
as
many
of
the
poorer
people
were
of
clothing
it
came
as
a
shock
to
nathaniel
kingsnorth
for
the
first
time
it
began
to
dawn
on
him
that
after
all
the
agitators
might
really
have
some
cause
to
agitate
that
their
attitude
was
not
one
of
merely
fighting
for
the
sake
of
the
fight
yet
a
lingering
suspicion
borne
of
his
early
training
and
his
father
doctrines
about
ireland
that
pat
was
really
a
scheming
dishonest
fellow
obtruded
itself
on
his
mind
even
as
he
became
more
than
half
convinced
of
the
little
village
desperate
plight
nathaniel
loathed
injustice
as
the
magistrate
of
his
county
he
punished
dishonesty
was
the
condition
he
saw
due
to
english
injustice
or
irish
dishonesty
that
was
the
problem
that
he
was
endeavouring
to
solve
there
does
seem
to
be
a
sixpence
circulating
through
the
whole
place
he
remarked
to
the
agent
when
that
gentleman
had
concluded
his
statement
of
the
position
of
matters
and
there
never
will
be
until
some
one
puts
money
into
the
village
instead
of
taking
it
out
of
it
said
the
agent
you
refer
to
the
i
do
and
it
many
the
time
i
wrote
your
father
them
same
words
it
is
surely
not
unnatural
for
owners
to
expect
to
be
paid
for
the
use
of
houses
and
land
is
it
we
expect
it
in
england
said
kingsnorth
drily
in
england
the
landlord
usually
lives
on
his
estate
and
takes
some
pride
in
it
small
pride
anyone
could
take
in
such
an
estate
as
this
kingsnorth
laughed
bitterly
then
he
went
on
and
as
for
living
on
it
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
disgust
before
the
kingsnorths
came
into
possession
the
macmahons
lived
on
it
and
proud
the
people
were
of
them
and
they
of
the
people
sir
i
wish
to
god
they
continued
to
said
kingsnorth
wrathfully
they
beggared
themselves
for
the
people
that
what
they
did
sir
improvements
here
a
road
there
a
quarry
cut
to
give
men
work
and
a
breakwater
built
to
keep
the
sea
from
washing
away
the
poor
homes
and
when
famine
came
not
a
penny
rent
asked
and
their
feedin
and
nursin
the
starvin
and
the
sick
an
all
the
time
raisin
money
to
do
it
a
mortgage
on
this
and
a
note
of
hand
for
that
until
the
whole
place
was
plastered
with
debt
then
out
they
were
turned
the
agent
moved
away
and
looked
out
across
the
lawn
to
conceal
his
emotion
charity
and
business
principles
scarcely
go
together
my
good
burke
said
kingsnorth
with
impatience
he
did
not
like
this
man
tone
it
suggested
a
glorification
of
the
former
bankrupt
landlord
and
a
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
present
solvent
one
so
the
english
think
burke
answered
kingsnorth
went
on
if
we
knew
the
whole
truth
we
would
probably
find
the
very
methods
these
people
used
were
the
cause
of
the
sorry
condition
this
village
is
in
now
no
landlord
has
the
right
to
pauperise
his
tenantry
by
giving
them
money
and
their
homes
it
is
a
man
duty
and
privilege
to
work
independence
that
is
what
a
man
should
aim
at
the
irish
are
always
crying
for
it
they
never
seem
to
practise
it
ye
ca
draw
the
water
out
of
a
kettle
and
expect
it
to
boil
sir
and
by
the
same
token
independence
is
a
fine
thing
to
tache
to
men
who
are
dependent
on
all
your
sympathies
appear
to
be
entirely
with
the
people
said
kingsnorth
looking
shrewdly
and
suspiciously
at
the
agent
no
one
could
live
here
man
and
boy
and
not
give
it
to
them
answered
burke
you
frank
anyway
pity
there
are
not
more
like
me
sir
i
see
what
it
is
possible
to
do
in
the
matter
of
improving
conditions
mind
i
promise
nothing
i
put
my
tenants
on
probation
it
seems
hopeless
i
start
works
for
the
really
needy
if
they
show
a
desire
to
take
advantage
of
my
interest
in
them
i
extend
my
operations
if
they
do
not
i
stop
everything
and
put
the
estate
on
the
market
burke
looked
at
him
and
smiled
a
dry
cracked
smile
he
was
a
thin
active
grizzled
man
well
past
fifty
with
keen
shrewd
eyes
that
twinkled
with
humour
or
sparkled
with
ferocity
or
melted
with
sorrow
as
the
mood
seized
him
as
he
answered
kingsnorth
the
eyes
twinkled
i
sure
it
grateful
the
poor
people
be
when
they
hear
the
good
news
of
yer
honour
interest
in
them
i
hope
so
although
history
teaches
us
that
gratitude
is
not
a
common
quality
in
ireland
an
irishman
is
being
roasted
you
will
always
find
another
irishman
to
turn
the
spit
a
statesman
quoted
in
the
house
of
commons
a
few
nights
ago
that
must
be
why
the
same
statesman
puts
them
in
prison
for
by
each
other
i
suppose
said
burke
with
a
faint
smile
you
are
now
speaking
of
the
curses
of
this
country
the
agitators
they
are
the
real
cause
of
this
deplorable
misery
who
will
put
money
into
a
country
that
is
ridden
by
these
scoundrels
rid
ireland
of
agitators
and
you
advance
her
prosperity
a
hundred
years
they
are
the
clogs
on
the
wheel
of
a
nation
progress
he
picked
up
a
copy
of
the
local
newspaper
and
read
a
headline
from
one
of
the
columns
i
see
you
have
agitators
even
here
we
have
sir
drive
them
out
of
the
town
let
the
people
live
their
own
lives
without
such
disturbing
elements
in
them
tell
them
distinctly
that
from
the
moment
they
begin
to
work
for
me
i
have
no
on
my
property
any
of
my
tenants
or
workmen
found
attending
them
elsewhere
will
be
evicted
and
discharged
i
tell
them
sir
i
mean
to
put
that
kind
of
lawlessness
down
with
a
firm
hand
if
ye
do
ye
be
the
first
mr
kingsnorth
there
is
one
i
see
glancing
again
at
the
paper
there
is
sir
who
is
this
man
a
native
of
the
village
sir
what
is
he
a
paid
agitator
faith
there
little
pay
he
gets
i
thinkin
why
do
the
police
arrest
him
mebbe
they
will
sir
i
see
that
they
do
burke
smiled
and
what
do
you
find
so
amusing
mr
burke
it
a
wondher
the
english
government
does
get
tired
of
them
as
fast
as
they
do
others
take
their
place
it
the
persecution
brings
fresh
converts
to
the
put
one
man
in
jail
and
be
a
hundred
new
followers
the
next
day
we
see
said
kingsnorth
firmly
here
is
one
district
where
the
law
will
be
enforced
these
meetings
and
their
frequent
bloodshed
are
a
disgrace
to
a
civilised
people
ye
may
well
say
that
yer
honour
replied
burke
before
i
invest
one
penny
to
better
the
condition
of
the
people
i
must
have
their
pledge
to
abandon
such
disgraceful
methods
of
trying
to
enlist
sympathy
i
begin
with
this
man
have
him
brought
to
me
i
manage
this
estate
my
own
way
or
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
my
father
was
often
tempted
to
he
resisted
the
temptation
though
sir
i
sorry
he
did
that
will
do
for
leave
these
statements
i
go
over
them
again
it
hard
to
make
head
or
tail
of
the
whole
business
be
here
tomorrow
at
ten
bring
that
fellow
with
you
also
give
me
a
list
of
some
of
the
more
intelligent
and
trustworthy
of
the
people
and
i
sound
them
as
to
the
prospects
of
opening
up
work
here
drop
them
a
hint
that
my
interest
is
solely
on
the
understanding
that
this
senseless
agitation
stops
i
will
sir
morning
at
ten
and
burke
started
for
the
door
oh
and
burke
i
hope
you
are
more
discreet
with
my
tenants
than
you
have
been
with
me
in
what
way
mr
kingsnorth
i
trust
that
you
confine
your
sympathy
with
them
to
your
feelings
and
not
give
expression
to
them
in
words
i
ca
say
that
i
do
mr
kingsnorth
it
would
be
wiser
to
in
future
mr
burke
well
ye
see
sir
i
a
man
first
and
an
agent
afterwards
indeed
yes
sir
it
many
the
ugly
thing
i
had
to
do
for
your
father
and
if
a
kind
word
of
mine
had
gone
with
it
it
precious
little
of
the
estate
would
be
fit
to
look
at
mr
kingsnorth
and
why
not
do
ye
remember
when
kilkee
scotch
steward
evicted
two
hundred
in
one
day
sir
i
do
not
rade
about
it
it
very
enlightenin
what
happened
the
poor
wretched
evicted
people
burnt
down
every
dwellin
and
tree
on
the
place
sir
i
would
know
how
to
handle
such
ruffians
that
what
kilkee
thought
them
a
lesson
said
he
them
into
the
ditches
and
he
did
he
thought
he
knew
how
to
handle
them
he
woke
up
with
a
jump
one
mornin
when
he
found
a
letter
from
the
tellin
him
his
scotch
master
was
in
the
hospital
with
a
bullet
in
his
spleen
and
the
beautiful
house
and
grounds
were
just
so
much
blackened
ashes
it
seems
to
me
my
good
man
there
is
a
note
of
agreement
with
such
methods
in
your
tone
manin
the
evictin
or
the
burnin
yer
honour
you
know
what
i
mean
and
kingsnorth
voice
rose
angrily
i
think
i
do
answered
burke
quietly
i
want
an
agent
who
is
devoted
to
my
interests
and
to
whom
the
people
are
secondary
then
ye
betther
send
to
england
for
one
sir
the
men
devoted
to
landlords
and
against
the
people
are
precious
few
in
this
part
of
ireland
sir
do
you
intend
that
i
should
act
on
that
if
ye
wish
ye
can
have
my
time
at
a
price
but
ye
wo
have
my
independence
for
any
sum
ye
like
to
offer
very
well
send
me
your
resignation
to
take
effect
one
month
from
it
grateful
i
am
kingsnorth
and
he
went
out
in
through
the
open
window
came
the
sound
of
the
tramping
of
many
feet
and
the
whisper
of
subdued
voices
kingsnorth
hurried
out
on
to
the
path
and
saw
a
number
of
men
and
women
walking
slowly
down
the
drive
in
the
centre
of
which
the
soldiers
were
carrying
a
body
on
some
branches
riding
beside
them
was
his
sister
angela
with
her
groom
what
new
horror
is
this
he
thought
as
he
hurried
down
the
path
to
meet
the
procession

kingsnorth
left
three
children
nathaniel
whose
acquaintance
we
have
already
made
and
who
in
a
large
measure
inherited
much
of
his
father
dominant
will
and
hardheadedness
monica
the
elder
daughter
and
angela
the
younger
nathaniel
was
the
old
man
favourite
while
still
a
youth
he
inculcated
into
the
boy
all
the
tenets
of
business
morality
and
politics
that
had
made
wilberforce
prosperous
pride
in
his
name
a
sturdy
grasp
of
life
an
unbending
attitude
toward
those
beneath
him
and
an
abiding
reverence
for
law
and
order
and
fealty
to
the
throne
these
were
the
foundations
on
which
the
father
built
nathaniel
character
next
in
point
of
regard
came
the
elder
daughter
monica
patrician
of
feature
haughty
in
manner
exclusive
by
nature
she
had
the
true
kingsnorth
air
she
had
no
disturbing
ideas
no
yearning
for
things
not
of
her
station
she
was
contented
with
the
world
as
it
had
been
made
for
her
and
seemed
duly
proud
and
grateful
to
have
been
born
a
kingsnorth
she
was
an
excellent
musician
rode
fairly
to
hounds
bestowed
prizes
at
the
local
charities
with
grace
and
distinction
as
became
a
kingsnorth
and
looked
coldly
out
at
the
world
from
behind
the
impenetrable
barriers
of
an
old
name
when
she
married
frederick
chichester
the
rising
barrister
connected
with
six
county
families
it
was
a
proud
day
for
old
kingsnorth
his
family
had
originally
made
their
money
in
trade
the
chichesters
had
accumulated
a
fortune
by
professions
the
distinction
in
england
is
marked
one
hesitates
to
acknowledge
the
salutation
of
the
man
who
provides
one
with
the
necessities
of
life
a
hearty
handshake
is
occasionally
extended
to
those
who
minister
to
one
luxuries
in
england
the
law
is
one
of
the
most
expensive
of
luxuries
and
its
devotees
command
the
highest
regard
frederick
chichester
came
of
a
long
line
of
illustrious
lawyers
one
had
even
reached
the
distinction
of
being
made
a
judge
he
belonged
to
an
honourable
profession
chichesters
had
made
the
laws
of
the
country
in
the
house
of
commons
as
well
as
administered
them
in
the
courts
the
old
man
was
overjoyed
he
made
a
handsome
settlement
on
his
eldest
daughter
on
her
marriage
and
felt
he
had
done
well
by
her
even
as
she
had
by
him
his
son
and
elder
daughter
were
distinctly
a
credit
to
him
five
years
after
monica
birth
angela
unexpectedly
was
born
to
the
kingsnorths
a
delicate
sickly
infant
it
seemed
as
if
the
splendid
blood
of
the
family
had
expended
its
vigour
on
the
elder
children
angela
needed
constant
attention
to
keep
her
alive
from
tremulous
infancy
she
grew
into
delicate
youth
none
of
the
strict
standards
kingsnorth
had
used
so
effectually
with
his
other
children
applied
to
her
she
seemed
a
child
apart
not
needing
her
kingsnorth
did
not
love
her
he
gave
her
a
form
of
tolerant
affection
too
fragile
to
mix
with
others
she
was
brought
up
at
home
tutors
furnished
her
education
the
winters
she
passed
abroad
with
her
mother
when
her
mother
died
she
spent
them
with
relations
or
friends
the
grim
dampness
of
the
english
climate
was
too
rigorous
for
a
life
that
needed
sunshine
angela
had
nothing
in
common
with
either
her
brother
or
her
sister
she
avoided
them
and
they
her
they
did
not
understand
her
she
understood
them
only
too
well
a
nature
that
craved
for
sympathy
and
affection
as
the
frail
so
often
do
was
repulsed
by
those
to
whom
affection
was
but
a
form
and
sympathy
a
term
of
reproach
she
loved
all
that
was
beautiful
and
as
so
frequently
happens
in
such
natures
as
angela
she
had
an
overwhelming
pity
for
all
that
were
unhappy
to
her
god
made
the
world
beautiful
man
was
responsible
for
its
hideousness
from
her
heart
she
pitied
mankind
for
abusing
the
gifts
god
had
showered
on
them
it
was
on
her
first
since
her
mother
death
that
her
attention
was
really
drawn
to
her
father
irish
possessions
by
a
curious
coincidence
she
returned
home
the
clay
following
wilberforce
kingsnorth
electrical
speech
invoking
providence
to
interpose
in
the
settlement
of
the
irish
difficulty
it
was
the
one
topic
of
conversation
throughout
dinner
and
it
was
during
that
dinner
that
angela
for
the
first
time
really
angered
her
father
and
raised
a
barrier
between
them
that
lasted
until
the
day
of
his
death
the
old
man
had
laughed
coarsely
at
the
remembrance
of
his
speech
on
the
previous
night
and
licked
his
lips
at
the
thought
of
it
monica
who
was
visiting
her
father
for
a
few
days
smiled
in
agreeable
sympathy
nathaniel
nodded
cheerfully
from
her
father
side
angela
asked
quietly
have
you
ever
been
in
ireland
father
no
i
have
not
answered
the
old
man
sharply
and
what
is
more
i
never
intend
to
go
there
do
you
know
anything
about
the
irish
persisted
angela
do
i
more
than
the
english
government
does
do
i
own
land
there
i
mean
do
you
know
anything
about
the
people
insisted
angela
i
know
them
to
be
a
lot
of
thieving
rascally
scoundrels
too
lazy
to
work
and
too
dishonest
to
pay
their
way
even
when
they
have
the
money
is
that
all
you
know
all
he
stopped
eating
to
look
angrily
at
his
daughter
the
was
not
to
his
liking
angela
went
on
yes
father
is
that
all
you
know
about
the
irish
is
it
enough
his
voice
rose
shrilly
it
was
the
first
time
for
years
anyone
had
dared
use
those
two
hated
words
ireland
and
irish
at
his
table
angela
must
be
checked
and
at
once
before
he
could
begin
to
check
her
however
angela
answered
his
question
it
would
be
enough
for
me
if
i
had
the
responsibilities
and
duties
of
a
landlord
to
be
the
owner
of
an
estate
should
be
to
act
as
the
people
friend
their
father
their
adviser
in
times
of
plenty
and
their
comrade
in
times
of
sorrow
indeed
and
pray
where
did
you
learn
all
that
miss
asked
the
astonished
parent
without
noticing
the
interruption
or
the
question
angela
went
on
why
deny
a
country
its
own
government
when
england
is
practically
governed
by
its
countrymen
is
there
any
position
of
prominence
today
in
england
that
is
filled
by
irishmen
think
our
is
irish
our
lord
high
admiral
is
irish
there
are
the
defences
of
the
english
in
the
hands
of
two
irishmen
and
yet
you
call
them
thieving
and
rascally
scoundrels
kingsnorth
tried
to
speak
angela
raised
her
voice
turn
to
your
judges
the
lord
chief
is
an
irishman
look
at
the
house
of
commons
our
laws
are
passed
or
defeated
by
the
irish
vote
and
yet
so
blindly
ignorant
and
obstinate
is
our
insular
prejudice
that
we
refuse
them
the
favours
they
do
us
governing
themselves
as
well
as
england
kingsnorth
looked
at
his
daughter
aghast
treason
in
his
own
house
his
child
speaking
the
two
most
hated
of
all
words
at
his
own
dinner
table
and
in
laudatory
terms
he
could
scarcely
believe
it
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
thundered
how
dare
you
how
dare
you
angela
smiled
a
little
smile
as
she
looked
frankly
at
her
father
and
answered
this
is
exactly
the
tone
we
english
take
to
anything
we
do
understand
and
that
is
why
other
countries
are
leaving
us
in
the
race
there
is
a
nation
living
within
a
few
hours
journey
from
our
doors
yet
millions
of
english
people
are
as
ignorant
of
them
as
if
they
lived
in
senegambia
she
paused
looked
once
more
straight
into
her
father
eyes
and
said
and
you
father
seem
to
be
as
ignorant
as
the
worst
of
them
angela
cried
her
sister
in
horror
nathaniel
laughed
leaned
across
to
angela
and
said
i
see
our
little
sister
has
been
reading
the
sensational
magazines
yes
i
done
more
than
that
replied
angela
in
nice
a
month
ago
were
two
english
members
of
parliament
who
had
taken
the
trouble
to
visit
the
country
they
were
supposed
to
assist
in
governing
they
told
me
that
a
condition
of
misery
existed
throughout
the
whole
of
ireland
that
was
incredible
under
a
civilised
government
radicals
eh
snapped
her
father
no
conservatives
one
of
them
had
once
held
the
office
of
chief
secretary
for
ireland
and
was
ireland
most
bitter
persecutor
until
he
visited
the
country
when
he
saw
the
wretchedness
of
her
people
he
stopped
his
stringent
methods
and
began
casting
about
for
some
ways
of
lessening
the
poor
people
torment
the
more
shame
to
him
to
talk
like
that
to
a
girl
and
what
more
you
had
no
right
to
listen
to
him
a
conservative
indeed
a
fine
one
he
must
be
he
is
i
do
see
why
the
liberal
party
should
have
all
the
enlightenment
and
the
conservative
party
all
the
bigotry
do
anger
your
father
pleaded
monica
why
little
angela
has
come
back
to
us
quite
a
revolutionary
said
nathaniel
leave
the
table
shouted
her
father
without
a
word
angela
got
up
quietly
and
left
the
room
her
manner
was
entirely
unmoved
she
had
spoken
from
her
inmost
convictions
the
fact
that
they
were
opposed
to
her
father
was
immaterial
she
loathed
tyranny
and
his
method
of
shutting
the
mouths
of
those
who
disagreed
with
him
was
particularly
obnoxious
to
her
it
was
also
most
ineffectual
with
her
from
childhood
she
had
always
spoken
as
she
felt
no
discipline
checked
her
freedom
of
speech
as
well
as
freedom
of
thought
were
as
natural
and
essential
to
her
as
breathing
was
from
that
time
she
saw
but
little
of
her
father
when
he
died
he
left
her
to
her
brother
care
kingsnorth
made
no
absolute
provision
for
her
she
was
to
be
dependent
on
nathaniel
when
the
time
came
that
she
seemed
to
wish
to
marry
if
her
brother
approved
of
the
match
he
should
make
a
handsome
settlement
on
her
in
response
to
her
request
nathaniel
allowed
her
to
go
with
him
to
ireland
on
his
tour
of
inspection
chichester
was
actively
engaged
at
the
old
bailey
on
an
important
criminal
case
so
monica
also
joined
them
everything
angela
saw
in
ireland
appealed
to
her
quick
sympathy
and
gentle
heart
it
was
just
as
she
had
thought
and
read
and
listened
to
on
every
side
she
saw
a
kindly
people
borne
down
by
the
weight
of
poverty
lives
ruined
by
sickness
and
the
lack
of
nourishment
a
splendid
race
perishing
through
misgovernment
and
intolerant
ignorance
angela
went
about
amongst
the
people
and
made
friends
with
them
they
were
chary
at
first
of
taking
her
to
their
hearts
she
was
of
the
hated
saxon
race
what
was
she
doing
there
she
the
sister
of
their
till
now
absentee
landlord
she
soon
won
them
over
by
her
appealing
voice
and
kindly
interest
all
this
angela
did
in
direct
opposition
to
her
brother
wishes
and
her
sister
exhortations
the
morning
of
the
meeting
she
had
ridden
some
mile
to
visit
a
poor
family
out
of
five
three
were
in
bed
with
low
fever
she
got
a
doctor
for
them
gave
them
money
to
buy
necessities
and
with
a
promise
to
return
the
next
day
she
rode
away
when
within
some
little
distance
of
her
brother
house
she
saw
a
steady
irregular
stream
of
people
climbing
a
great
hill
she
rode
toward
it
and
screened
by
a
clump
of
trees
saw
and
heard
the
meeting
when
first
spoke
his
voice
thrilled
her
gradually
the
excitement
of
the
people
under
the
mastery
of
his
power
communicated
itself
to
her
it
pulsed
in
her
blood
and
throbbed
in
her
brain
for
the
first
time
she
realised
what
a
marvellous
force
was
the
call
of
the
patriot
to
listen
and
watch
a
man
risking
life
and
liberty
in
the
cause
of
his
country
her
heart
and
her
mind
and
her
soul
went
out
to
him
when
the
soldiers
marched
on
to
the
scene
she
was
paralysed
with
fear
when
the
order
to
fire
was
gives
she
wanted
to
ride
into
their
midst
and
cry
out
to
them
to
stop
but
she
was
unable
to
move
hand
or
foot
when
the
smoke
had
thinned
and
she
saw
the
bodies
lying
motionless
on
the
ground
of
men
who
a
moment
before
had
been
full
of
life
and
strength
when
was
added
to
that
the
horror
of
the
wounded
crying
out
with
pain
her
first
impulse
was
to
fly
from
the
sight
of
the
carnage
she
mastered
that
moment
of
fear
and
plunged
forward
calling
to
the
groom
to
follow
her
what
immediately
followed
has
already
been
told
the
long
slow
tortuous
journey
home
the
men
slowly
following
with
the
ghastly
on
the
rude
litter
became
a
living
memory
to
her
for
all
the
remainder
of
her
life
she
glanced
down
every
little
while
at
the
face
and
shuddered
as
she
found
herself
wondering
if
eke
would
ever
hear
his
voice
again
or
see
those
great
eyes
flash
with
his
fierce
courage
and
devotion
once
only
did
the
lips
of
the
wounded
man
move
in
a
moment
angela
had
dismounted
and
halted
the
soldiers
as
she
bent
down
over
him
swooned
again
from
pain
the
procession
went
on
as
they
neared
her
brother
house
stragglers
began
to
follow
curiously
sad
looking
men
and
weary
women
joined
the
procession
wonderingly
all
guessed
it
was
some
fresh
outrage
of
the
soldiers
little
ragged
children
peered
down
at
the
body
on
the
litter
and
either
ran
away
crying
or
joined
in
listlessly
with
the
others
it
was
an
old
story
carrying
back
mutilated
men
to
the
village
none
was
surprised
it
seemed
to
angela
that
an
infinity
of
time
had
passed
before
they
entered
the
grounds
attached
to
the
kingsnorth
house
she
sent
a
man
on
ahead
to
order
a
room
to
be
prepared
and
a
doctor
sent
for
as
she
saw
her
brother
coming
forward
to
meet
her
with
knit
brows
and
stern
eyes
she
nerved
herself
to
greet
him
what
is
this
angela
he
asked
looking
in
amazement
at
the
strange
procession
another
martyr
to
our
ignorant
government
nathaniel
and
she
pressed
on
through
the
drive
to
the
house
chapter
vi
angela
speaks
her
mind
freely
to
nathaniel
nathaniel
indignation
at
his
sister
conduct
was
beyond
bounds
when
he
learnt
who
the
wounded
man
was
he
ordered
the
soldiers
to
take
the
man
and
themselves
away
the
magistrate
interposed
and
begged
him
to
at
least
let
rest
there
until
a
doctor
could
patch
him
up
it
might
be
dangerous
to
take
him
back
without
medical
treatment
he
assured
nathaniel
that
the
moment
they
could
move
him
he
would
be
lodged
in
the
nathaniel
went
back
to
his
study
as
the
sorry
procession
passed
on
to
the
front
door
he
sent
immediately
for
his
sister
the
reply
came
back
that
she
would
see
him
at
dinner
he
commanded
her
to
come
to
him
at
once
in
a
few
minutes
angela
came
into
the
room
she
was
deathly
pale
her
voice
trembled
as
she
spoke
what
do
you
want
why
did
you
bring
that
man
here
because
he
is
wounded
such
scoundrels
are
better
dead
i
do
think
so
nor
do
i
think
him
a
scoundrel
he
came
here
to
attack
landlords
to
attack
me
me
and
you
bring
him
to
my
house
and
with
that
rabble
it
outrageous
monstrous
i
could
leave
him
with
those
heartless
wretches
to
die
in
their
hands
he
leaves
here
the
moment
a
doctor
has
attended
him
very
well
is
that
all
no
it
is
kingsnorth
tried
to
control
his
anger
after
a
pause
he
continued
i
want
no
more
of
these
foolhardy
quixotic
actions
of
yours
heard
of
your
visiting
these
wretched
people
going
into
fever
dens
is
that
conduct
becoming
your
name
think
a
little
of
your
station
in
life
and
what
it
demands
i
wish
you
did
a
little
more
what
he
shouted
all
his
anger
returned
there
no
need
to
raise
your
voice
angela
answered
quietly
i
am
only
a
few
feet
away
i
repeat
that
i
wish
you
thought
a
little
more
of
your
obligations
if
you
did
and
others
like
you
in
the
same
position
you
are
in
there
would
be
no
such
horrible
scenes
as
i
saw
a
man
shot
down
amongst
his
own
people
for
speaking
the
truth
you
saw
it
nathaniel
asked
in
dismay
i
did
i
not
only
saw
but
i
heard
i
wish
you
had
too
i
heard
a
man
lay
bare
his
heart
and
his
brain
and
his
soul
that
others
might
knew
the
light
in
them
i
saw
and
heard
a
man
offer
up
his
life
that
others
might
know
some
gleam
of
happiness
in
their
lives
it
was
wonderful
it
was
heroic
it
was
if
i
ever
hear
of
you
doing
such
a
thing
again
you
shall
go
back
to
london
the
next
day
that
sounds
exactly
as
though
my
dead
father
were
speaking
i
not
be
made
a
by
you
you
make
yourself
one
as
your
father
did
before
you
a
kingsnorth
what
has
your
name
meant
because
one
of
our
forefathers
cheated
the
world
into
giving
him
a
fortune
by
buying
his
goods
for
more
than
they
were
worth
we
have
tried
to
canonise
him
and
put
a
halo
around
the
name
of
kingsnorth
to
me
it
stands
for
all
that
is
mean
and
selfish
and
vain
and
ignorant
the
power
of
money
over
intellect
how
did
we
become
owners
of
this
miserable
piece
of
land
a
kingsnorth
swindled
its
rightful
owner
lent
him
money
on
usury
bought
up
his
bills
and
his
mortgages
and
when
he
could
pay
foreclosed
on
him
no
wander
there
a
curse
on
the
village
and
on
us
kingsnorth
tried
to
speak
but
she
stopped
him
wait
a
moment
it
was
a
good
stroke
of
business
taking
this
estate
away
oh
yes
it
was
a
good
stroke
of
business
our
name
has
been
built
up
on
strokes
of
business
well
i
tell
you
it
a
bad
stroke
of
business
when
human
lives
are
put
into
the
hands
of
such
creatures
as
we
kingsnorths
have
proved
ourselves
stop
cried
nathaniel
outraged
to
the
innermost
sanctuary
of
his
being
stop
you
do
speak
like
one
of
our
family
it
is
like
listening
to
some
heretic
some
i
do
feel
like
one
of
your
family
you
are
a
kingsnorth
am
my
mother
child
my
poor
gentle
patient
mother
who
lived
a
life
of
unselfish
resignation
who
welcomed
death
when
it
came
to
her
as
a
release
from
tyranny
do
call
me
a
kingsnorth
i
know
the
family
too
well
i
know
all
the
name
means
to
the
people
who
have
suffered
through
your
family
after
this
the
best
thing
the
only
thing
is
to
separate
said
nathaniel
whenever
you
wish
i
make
you
an
allowance
do
let
it
be
a
burden
i
never
been
so
shocked
so
stunned
i
am
glad
from
my
cradle
i
been
shocked
and
stunned
in
my
home
it
some
compensation
to
know
you
are
capable
of
the
feeling
too
frankly
i
did
think
you
were
we
talk
no
more
of
this
and
nathaniel
began
to
pace
the
room
i
am
finished
and
angela
went
to
the
door
it
would
be
better
we
did
meet
again
in
any
event
not
often
added
nathaniel
thank
you
said
angela
opening
the
door
he
motioned
her
to
close
it
that
he
had
something
more
to
say
we
find
you
some
suitable
chaperone
you
can
spend
your
winters
abroad
as
you
have
been
doing
london
for
the
season
until
suitably
married
i
follow
out
my
father
wishes
to
the
letter
you
shall
be
handsomely
provided
for
the
day
you
marry
she
closed
the
door
with
a
snap
and
came
back
to
him
and
looked
him
steadily
in
the
eyes
the
man
i
marry
shall
take
nothing
from
you
even
in
his
will
and
testament
my
father
proved
himself
a
kingsnorth
it
was
only
a
kingsnorth
could
make
his
youngest
daughter
dependent
on
you
my
father
knew
i
would
respect
his
wishes
he
was
equally
responsible
for
me
yet
he
leaves
me
to
your
care
a
kingsnorth
the
men
masters
and
the
women
slaves
that
is
the
kingsnorth
doctrine
it
is
a
pity
our
father
did
live
a
little
longer
there
are
many
changes
coming
into
this
old
grey
world
of
ours
and
one
of
them
is
the
real
honourable
position
of
woman
the
day
will
come
in
england
when
we
will
wring
from
our
fathers
and
our
brothers
as
our
right
what
is
doled
out
to
us
now
as
though
we
were
beggars
and
they
are
trying
to
govern
the
country
of
ireland
in
the
same
way
the
reign
of
the
despot
well
that
is
nearly
over
too
even
as
degrading
position
is
almost
at
an
end
have
you
finished
once
again
angela
went
to
the
door
nathaniel
said
in
a
somewhat
changed
tone
as
it
is
your
wish
this
man
should
be
cared
for
i
do
it
when
he
is
well
enough
to
be
moved
the
magistrate
will
take
him
to
jail
but
for
the
little
while
we
shall
be
here
i
beg
you
not
to
do
anything
so
unseemly
again
a
servant
came
in
to
tell
angela
the
doctor
had
come
without
a
word
angela
went
out
to
see
to
the
wounded
man
the
servant
followed
her
left
alone
nathaniel
sat
down
shocked
and
stunned
to
review
the
interview
he
had
just
had
with
his
youngest
sister
chapter
vii
the
wounded
patriot
when
angela
entered
the
she
found
mcginnis
a
cheery
rotund
little
man
of
fifty
talking
freely
to
the
patient
and
punctuating
each
speech
with
a
hearty
laugh
his
was
infectious
the
wounded
agitator
felt
the
effect
of
it
and
was
trying
to
laugh
feebly
himself
sure
it
the
fine
target
ye
must
have
made
with
yer
six
feet
and
one
inch
how
could
the
poor
soldiers
help
hittin
ye
answer
me
that
and
the
jovial
doctor
laughed
again
as
he
dexterously
wound
a
bandage
around
arm
aisy
now
while
i
tie
the
bandage
me
fine
fellow
ye
live
to
see
the
inside
of
an
english
jail
yet
he
turned
as
he
heard
the
door
open
and
greeted
angela
good
afternoon
to
ye
miss
kingsnorth
faith
it
a
blessin
ye
brought
the
boy
here

english

into
the
irish

they
used

thank
the
merciful
forster
for
that
same
as
the
irish
reverently
call
him
angela
flushed
with
indignation
as
she
looked
at
the
crippled
man
what
a
dastardly
thing
to
do
she
cried
ye
may
well
say
that
miss
kingsnorth
said
the
merry
little
doctor
but
it
betther
than
a
bullet
from
a
rifle
that
what
it
is
and
there
many
a
poor
english
landlord
got
one
of
in
the
back
for
ridin
about
at
night
on
his
own
land
it
a
fatherly
government
we
have
miss
kingsnorth
but

they
then
put

the
fine
talkin
and
patriotism
out
of
them
sez
they
they
never
take
it
out
of
me
they
may
kill
me
perhaps
but
until
they
do
they
never
silence

murmured
in
a
voice
so
low
yet
so
bitter
that
it
startled
angela
ye
do
that
all
in
good
time
me
fine
boy
said
the
busy
little
doctor
here
take
a
pull
at
this
and
he
handed
the
patient
a
glass
in
which
he
had
dropped
a
few
crystals
into
some
water
as
drank
the
mixture
mcginnis
said
in
a
whisper
to
angela
let
him
have
that
every
three
hours
oftener
if
he
wants
to
talk
we
got
to
get
his
mind
at
rest
a
good
sleep
make
a
new
man
of
him
there
no
danger
asked
angela
in
the
same
tone
none
in
the
wurrld
he
got
a
fine
constitution
and
mebbe
the
buckshot
was
pretty
clean
i
washed
them
out
well
to
think
of
men
shot
down
like
dogs
for
speaking
of
their
country
it
horrible
it
wicked
it
monstrous
faith

irishmen

from
the
sick
bed
faith
and
they
are
now
and
it
small
wondher
the
men
who
sit
in
whitehall
in
london
trate
them
like
savages
i
seen
things
since
i
been
here
that
would
justify
almost
anything
cried
angela
i
seen
suffering
no
one
in
england
dreamt
of
misery
that
london
with
all
its
poverty
and
wretchedness
could
not
compare
with
were
i
born
in
ireland
i
should
be
proud
to
stake
my
liberty
and
my
life
to
protect
my
own
people
from
such
horrible
brutality
the
wounded
man
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
full
at
angela
it
was
a
look
at
once
of
gratitude
and
reverence
and
admiration
her
heart
leaped
within
her
so
far
no
man
in
the
little
zone
she
had
lived
in
had
ever
stirred
her
to
an
even
momentary
enthusiasm
they
were
all
so
fatuously
contented
with
their
environment
sheltered
from
birth
their
anxiety
was
chiefly
how
to
make
life
pass
the
pleasantest
they
occasionally
showed
a
spasmodic
excitement
over
the
progress
of
a
cricket
or
polo
match
their
achievements
were
largely
those
of
the
warriors
who
fought
with
the
quill
what
others
faced
death
with
the
sword
for
their
inertia
disgusted
her
their
spurred
her
to
resentment
here
was
a
man
in
the
real
heart
of
life
he
was
engaged
in
a
struggle
that
makes
existence
worth
while
the
effort
to
bring
a
message
to
his
people
how
all
the
conversations
she
was
forced
to
listen
to
in
her
narrow
world
rose
up
before
her
in
their
carping
meannesses
her
brutal
diatribes
against
a
people
unfortunate
enough
to
be
compelled
from
force
of
circumstance
to
live
on
a
portion
of
land
that
belonged
to
him
yet
in
whose
lives
he
took
no
interest
whatsoever
his
only
anxiety
was
to
be
paid
his
rents
how
and
through
what
misery
his
tenants
scraped
the
money
together
to
do
it
with
mattered
nothing
to
him
all
that
did
matter
was
that
he
must
be
paid
then
arose
a
picture
of
her
sister
monica
with
her
puny
social
pretensions
recognition
of
those
in
a
higher
grade
bread
and
meat
and
drink
to
her
adulation
and
gross
flattery
the
very
breath
of
her
nostrils
her
brother
cheap
narrow
platitudes
about
the
rights
of
rank
and
wealth
to
angela
wealth
had
no
rights
except
to
bring
happiness
to
the
world
it
seemed
to
bring
only
misery
once
people
acquired
it
grim
sorrow
seemed
to
stalk
in
the
trail
of
the
rich
she
could
not
recall
one
moment
of
real
unfeigned
happiness
among
her
family
the
only
time
she
could
remember
her
father
smiling
or
chuckling
was
at
some
one
else
misfortune
or
over
some
cruel
thing
he
had
said
himself
her
sister
joy
over
some
little
social
triumph
usually
at
the
cost
of
the
humiliation
of
another
her
brother
cheeriness
over
some
smart
stroke
of
business
in
which
another
firm
was
involved
to
their
cost
parasites
all
the
memory
of
her
mother
was
the
only
link
that
bound
her
to
her
childhood
the
gentle
uncomplaining
spirit
of
her
the
unselfish
abnegation
of
her
the
soul
tragedy
of
her
giving
up
her
life
at
the
altar
of
duty
at
the
bidding
of
a
hardened
despot
all
angela
childhood
came
back
in
a
brief
illuminating
flash
the
face
of
her
one
dear
dead
companion
her
mother
glowed
before
her
how
her
mother
would
have
cared
for
and
tended
and
worshipped
a
man
even
as
the
one
lying
riddled
on
that
bed
of
suffering
all
the
best
in
angela
was
from
her
mother
all
the
resolute
fighting
quality
was
from
her
father
she
would
use
both
now
in
defence
of
the
wounded
man
she
would
tend
him
and
care
for
him
and
see
that
no
harm
came
to
him
she
was
roused
from
her
thoughts
by
the
doctor
voice
and
the
touch
of
his
hand
for
the
present
miss
kingsnorth
sure
it
in
good
hands
lavin
him
but
for
you
he
be
lyin
in
the
black
jail
with
old
doctor
costello
glarin
down
at
him
with
his
gimlet
eyes
i
would
wish
a
dog
that
faith
i

costello
to
open
a
wound
to
see
if
it
was
healthy

a
little
and
give
him
something
make
him
slape
like
a
top
till
mornin
to
yez
for
the
present
and
the
kindly
plump
little
man
hurried
out
with
the
faint
echo
of
a
tune
whistling
through
his
lips
angela
sat
down
at
a
little
distance
from
the
sickbed
and
watched
the
wounded
man
his
face
was
drawn
with
pain
his
eyes
were
closed
but
he
was
not
sleeping
his
fingers
locked
and
unlocked
his
lips
moved
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
you
need
not
stay
here
he
said
would
you
rather

did
asked
angela
rising
why
did
you
bring
me
here
to
make
sure

wounds
were
attended
to
your
brother

a
landlord

in

it
was
a
great
pity
here
one
that
dublin
castle
and
the
english
government

i
serve
my
time
in
prisons
when
i
well
enough
it
the
first
time
they
caught
me
and
they
had
to
shoot
me
to
do
it
and
when
i
come
out
i
come
straight
back
here
and
take
up
the
work
just
where
i
leaving
it
you
must
go
to
prison
it
the
lot
of
every
irishman
who
says
what
he
thinks
it
must
be
yours
it
must
angela
voice
rose
in
her
distress
she
repeated
it
must
i
appeal
to
my
brother
to
stop
it
if
he
anything
like
his
father
it
small
heed
he
pay
to
your
pleading
the
poor
wretches
here
appealed
to
old
kingsnorth
in
famine
and
sickness
not
for
help
mind
ye
just
for
a
little
time
to
pay
their
rents
and
the
only
answer
they
ever
got
from
him
was
or
go
i
know
i
know
angela
replied
and
many
a
time
when
i
was
a
child
my
mother
and
i
cried
over
it
he
looked
at
her
curiously
you
and
yer
mother
cried
over
us
we
did
indeed
we
did
they
say
the
heart
of
england
is
in
its
womenkind
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
laws
they
will
have
some
day
it
be
a
long
time
comin
i
thinkin
if
they
take
so
long
to
free
a
whole
country
how
long
do
ye
suppose
it
take
them
to
free
a
whole
sex
and
the
female
one
at
that
it
will
come
she
said
resolutely
he
looked
at
her
strangely
and
you
cried
over
ireland
sorrows
as
a
child
and
as
a
woman
said
angela
and
ye
gone
about
here
tryin
to
help
them
too
have
ye
i
could
do
very
little
well
the
spirit
is
there
and
the
heart
is
there
if
they
liked
you
it
the
sorry
time
maybe
your
brother
would
have
he
paused
again
looking
at
her
intently
whilst
his
fingers
clutched
the
coverlet
convulsively
as
if
to
stifle
a
cry
of
pain
may
i
ask
ye
yer
name
he
gasped
angela
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
angela
he
repeated
angela
it
well
named

the
ministering
angel

down
here

wurrld
beatin
in
me
brain
and
throbbin
in
me
heart
try
and
sleep
until
the
doctor
comes
he
lay
back
and
closed
his
eyes
angela
sat
perfectly
still
in
a
few
minutes
he
opened
them
again
there
was
a
new
light
in
his
eyes
and
a
smile
on
his
lips
ye
heard
me
speak
did
ye
yes
where
were
ye
above
you
behind
a
bank
of
trees
a
playful
smile
played
around
his
lips
as
he
said
it
was
a
good
speech
was
it
i
thought
it
wonderful
angela
answered
and
what
were
yer
feelings
listenin
to
a
man
urgin
the
people
against
yer
own
country
i
felt
i
wanted
to
stand
beside
you
and
echo
everything
you
said
did
you
and
his
eyes
blazed
and
his
voice
rose
you
spoke
as
some
prophet
speaking
in
a
wilderness
of
sorrow
trying
to
bring
them
comfort
he
smiled
whimsically
as
he
said
in
a
weary
voice
i
tried
to
bring
them
comfort
and
i
got
them
broken
heads
and
it
only
through
suffering
every
great
cause
triumphs
said
angela
then
the
irish
should
triumph
some
day
they
suffered
enough
god
knows
they
will
said
angela
eagerly
oh
how
i
wish
i
been
born
a
man
to
throw
in
my
lot
with
the
weak
to
bring
comfort
to
sorrow
freedom
to
the
oppressed
joy
to
wretchedness
that
is
your
mission
how
i
envy
you
i
glory
in
what
the
future
has
in
store
for
you
live
for
it

for
it
i
will
cried
some
day
the
yoke
will
be
lifted
from
us

that
mine
will
be
the
hand
to
help
do
it
god
grant
i
am
alive
to
see
it
done
that
day
be
worth
living
for
to
wring
recognition
from
our
enemies
to
to
to
he
sank
back
weakly
on
the
pillow
his
voice
fainting
to
a
whisper
angela
brought
him
some
water
and
helped
him
up
while
he
drank
it
she
smoothed
back
the
shining
hair
red
shot
through
gold
from
his
forehead
he
thanked
her
with
a
look
suddenly
he
burst
into
tears
the
strain
of
the
day
had
snapped
his
at
last
the
floodgates
were
opened
he
sobbed
and
sobbed
like
some
tired
hurt
child
angela
tried
to
comfort
him
in
a
moment
she
was
crying
too
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
repeatedly
the
tears
falling
on
it
as
he
did
so
god
bless
ye
god
bless
ye
he
cried
in
that
moment
of
their
hearts
went
out
to
each
other
neither
had
known
happiness
nor
love
nor
faith
in
mankind
in
that
one
enlightening
moment
of
emotion
their
hearts
were
laid
bare
to
each
other
the
great
comedy
of
life
between
man
and
woman
had
begun
from
that
moment
their
lives
were
linked
together
chapter
viii
angela
in
sore
distress
three
days
afterwards
was
able
to
dress
and
move
about
his
room
he
was
weak
from
loss
of
blood
and
the
confinement
that
an
active
man
resents
but
his
brain
was
clear
and
vivid
they
had
been
three
wonderful
days
angela
had
made
them
the
most
amazing
in
his
life
the
memory
of
those
hours
spent
with
her
he
would
carry
to
his
grave
she
read
to
him
and
talked
to
him
and
lectured
him
and
comforted
him
there
were
times
when
he
thanked
the
power
that
shapes
our
ends
for
having
given
him
this
one
supreme
experience
the
cadences
of
her
voice
would
haunt
him
through
the
years
to
come
and
in
a
little
while
he
must
leave
it
all
he
must
stand
his
trial
under
the
crimes
act
for
speaking
at
a
proclaimed
meeting
well
whatever
his
torture
he
knew
he
would
come
out
better
equipped
for
the
struggle
he
had
learned
something
of
himself
he
had
so
far
never
dreamed
of
in
his
bitter
struggle
with
the
handicap
of
his
life
he
had
something
to
live
for
now
besides
the
call
of
his
country
the
call
of
the
heart
the
cry
of
beauty
and
truth
and
reverence
angela
inspired
him
with
all
these
in
the
three
days
she
ministered
to
him
she
had
opened
up
a
vista
he
had
hitherto
never
known
and
now
he
had
to
leave
it
and
face
his
accusers
and
be
hectored
and
jeered
at
in
the
mockery
they
called
trials
from
the
he
would
go
to
the
prison
and
from
thence
he
would
be
sent
back
into
the
world
with
the
brand
of
the
upon
him
as
the
thought
of
all
this
passed
through
his
mind
he
never
wavered
he
would
face
it
as
he
had
faced
trouble
all
his
life
with
body
knit
for
the
struggle
and
his
heart
strong
for
the
battle
and
back
of
it
all
the
yearning
that
at
the
end
she
would
be
waiting
and
watching
for
his
return
to
the
conflict
for
the
great
cause
to
which
he
had
dedicated
his
life
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
roche
the
resident
magistrate
was
sent
for
by
nathaniel
kingsnorth
roche
found
him
firm
and
determined
his
back
to
the
fireplace
in
which
a
bright
fire
was
burning
although
the
month
was
july
even
the
climate
of
ireland
rebels
against
the
usual
laws
of
nature
thought
kingsnorth
as
he
shivered
and
glanced
at
the
steady
drenching
downpour
that
had
lasted
practically
ever
since
he
had
set
foot
in
the
wretched
country
the
magistrate
came
forward
and
greeted
him
respectfully
good
morning
roche
said
nathaniel
motioning
him
to
sit
down
by
the
fire
i
sent
for
you
to
remove
this
man
added
nathaniel
after
a
pause
certainly
if
he
is
well
enough
to
be
moved
the
doctor
i
understand
says
that
he
is
very
well
i
drive
him
down
to
the
the
court
is
sitting
now
said
roche
rising
kingsnorth
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
i
want
you
to
understand
it
was
against
my
express
wishes
that
he
was
ever
brought
into
this
house
miss
kingsnorth
told
me
when
i
had
arrested
him
that
you
would
shelter
him
and
go
bail
for
him
if
necessary
said
roche
in
some
surprise
my
sister
does
things
under
impulse
that
she
often
regrets
afterwards
this
is
one
i
hope
there
is
no
harm
done
none
in
the
world
replied
the
magistrate
on
the
contrary
the
people
seem
to
have
a
much
higher
opinion
of
you
kingsnorth
since
the
occurrence
he
added
their
opinion
good
or
bad
is
a
matter
of
complete
indifference
to
me
i
am
only
anxious
that
the
representatives
of
the
government
do
not
suppose
that
because
through
mistaken
ideas
of
charity
my
sister
brought
this
man
to
my
house
i
in
any
way
sanction
his
attitude
and
his
views
i
should
not
fear
that
kingsnorth
you
have
always
been
regarded
as
a
most
loyal
subject
sir
answered
roche
i
am
glad
what
sentence
is
he
likely
to
get
it
depends
largely
on
his
previous
record
will
it
be
settled
if
the
jury
bring
in
a
verdict
sometimes
they
are
out
all
night
on
these
cases
a
jury
good
god
a
jury
of
irishmen
to
try
an
irishman
they
being
trained
gradually
sir
it
should
never
be
left
to
them
in
a
country
like
this
a
judge
should
have
the
power
of
condemning
such
criminals
without
trial
he
be
condemned
said
roche
confidently
what
jury
will
convict
him
if
they
all
sympathise
with
him
answer
me
that
that
was
one
difficulty
we
had
to
face
at
first
roche
answered
it
was
hard
indeed
as
you
say
to
get
an
irishman
convicted
by
an
irish
jury
especially
the
agitators
but
we
changed
that
we
made
them
see
that
loyalty
to
the
throne
is
better
than
loyalty
to
a
fenian
how
have
they
done
it
a
little
persuasion
and
some
slight
coercion
sir
i
am
glad
of
it
it
would
be
a
crime
against
justice
for
a
man
who
openly
breaks
the
law
not
to
be
punished
through
being
tried
before
a
jury
of
sympathisers
few
of
them
escape
kingsnorth
dublin
castle
found
the
way
one
has
to
meet
craft
with
craft
and
opposition
with
firmness
under
the
present
government
we
succeeded
wonderfully
roche
smiled
pleasantly
as
he
thought
of
the
many
convictions
he
had
been
instrumental
in
procuring
himself
kingsnorth
seemed
delighted
also
good
he
said
the
condition
of
things
here
is
a
disgrace
mind
you
i
not
criticising
the
actions
of
the
officials
he
hastened
to
add
the
magistrate
bowed
kingsnorth
went
on
but
the
attitude
of
the
people
their
views
their
conduct
is
deplorable
opeless
i
came
here
to
see
what
i
could
do
for
them
i
even
thought
of
spending
a
certain
portion
of
each
year
here
but
from
what
i
heard
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
and
money
it
is
discouraging
at
first
sight
but
we
have
a
better
state
of
affairs
presently
we
must
first
stamp
out
the
agitator
he
is
the
most
potent
handicap
next
are
the
priests
they
are
nearest
to
the
people
the
real
solution
of
the
irish
difficulty
would
be
to
make
the
whole
nation
protestants
could
it
be
done
it
would
take
time
every
big
movement
takes
time
roche
paused
looked
shrewdly
at
kingsnorth
and
asked
him
what
do
you
intend
doing
with
this
estate
i
am
in
a
quandary
i
almost
determined
to
put
it
in
the
market
sell
it
be
rid
of
it
it
has
always
been
a
source
of
annoyance
to
our
family
however
i
settle
nothing
until
i
return
to
london
i
go
in
a
few
days
much
sooner
than
i
intended
this
man
being
brought
into
my
house
has
annoyed
and
upset
me
i
sorry
said
the
magistrate
miss
kingsnorth
was
so
insistent
and
the
fellow
seemed
in
a
bad
way
otherwise
i
would
never
have
allowed
it
a
servant
came
in
response
to
kingsnorth
ring
and
was
sent
with
a
message
to
have
the
man
ready
to
accompany
the
magistrate
as
quickly
as
possible
over
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
cigar
the
two
men
resumed
their
discussion
i
would
decide
too
hastily
about
disposing
of
the
land
although
there
always
a
good
deal
of
discontent
there
is
really
very
little
trouble
here
in
fact
until
agitators
like
came
amongst
us
we
had
everything
pretty
peaceful
we
dispose
of
him
in
short
order
do
do
make
an
example
of
him
trust
us
to
do
that
said
roche
after
a
moment
he
added
to
refer
again
to
selling
the
estate
you
would
get
very
little
for
it
it
depreciate
much
more
and
there
is
always
the
chance
it
may
improve
some
of
the
people
are
quite
willing
to
work
are
they
they
not
shown
any
willingness
to
me
oh
no
they
would
what
not
to
their
landlord
you
be
the
last
they
show
it
to
they
strange
people
in
many
ways
until
you
get
to
know
them
now
there
are
many
natural
resources
that
might
be
developed
if
some
capital
were
put
into
them
my
new
steward
discouraged
me
about
doing
that
he
said
it
might
be
ten
years
before
i
got
a
penny
out
your
new
steward
andrew
mcpherson
the
lawyer
yes
he
a
hard
man
sir
the
estate
needs
one
burke
understands
the
people
he
sympathises
with
them
i
do
want
a
man
like
that
working
for
me
i
want
loyalty
to
my
interests
the
makeshift
policy
of
burke
during
my
father
lifetime
helped
to
bring
about
this
pretty
state
of
things
we
see
what
firmness
will
do
new
broom
sweep
the
place
clean
rid
it
of
slovenly
ungrateful
tenants
clear
away
the
orators
i
have
a
definite
plan
in
my
mind
if
i
decide
not
to
sell
i
perfect
my
plan
in
london
and
begin
operations
as
soon
as
i
satisfied
it
is
feasible
and
can
be
put
upon
a
proper
business
basis
there
too
much
sentiment
in
ireland
that
been
their
ruin
am
going
to
bring
a
little
common
sense
into
play
kingsnorth
walked
restlessly
around
the
room
as
he
spoke
he
stopped
by
the
windows
and
beckoned
the
magistrate
there
your
man
on
the
drive
see
and
he
pointed
to
where
with
a
soldier
each
side
of
him
was
slowly
moving
down
the
long
avenue
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
angela
came
in
hurriedly
and
went
straight
to
where
the
two
men
stood
there
was
the
catch
of
a
sob
in
her
voice
as
she
spoke
to
the
magistrate
are
you
taking
that
poor
wounded
man
to
prison
the
doctor
says
he
is
well
enough
to
be
moved
replied
roche
you
not
seen
the
doctor
i
just
questioned
him
he
told
me
you
had
not
asked
his
opinion
and
that
if
you
move
him
it
will
be
without
his
sanction
kingsnorth
interrupted
angrily
please
do
interfere
angela
turned
on
him
so
it
you
who
are
sending
him
to
prison
i
am
angela
appealed
to
the
magistrate
do
do
this
i
entreat
you
do
do
it
but
i
have
no
choice
miss
kingsnorth
the
man
can
scarcely
walk
she
pleaded
he
will
receive
every
attention
believe
me
miss
kingsnorth
roche
replied
angela
faced
her
brother
again
if
you
let
that
wounded
man
go
from
this
house
you
will
regret
it
to
the
end
of
your
life
her
face
was
her
breath
was
coming
thickly
her
eyes
were
fastened
in
hatred
on
her
brother
face
kindly
try
and
control
yourself
angela
kingsnorth
said
sternly
you
should
consider
my
position
a
little
more
your
position
and
what
is
his
you
with
everything
you
want
in
life
that
man
with
nothing
he
is
being
hounded
to
prison
for
what
pleading
for
his
country
is
that
a
crime
he
was
shot
down
by
soldiers
for
what
for
showing
something
we
english
are
always
boasting
of
feeling
ourselves
and
resent
any
other
nation
feeling
it
patriotism
stop
commanded
kingsnorth
if
you
take
that
sick
wretched
man
out
of
this
house
it
will
be
a
crime
began
angela
kingsnorth
stopped
her
he
turned
to
the
magistrate
kindly
take
the
man
away
roche
moved
to
the
window
angela
heart
sank
all
her
pleading
was
in
vain
her
voice
faltered
and
broke
very
well
then
take
him
sentence
him
for
doing
something
his
own
countrymen
will
one
day
build
a
monument
to
him
for
doing
the
moment
the
closes
behind
him
a
thousand
voices
will
cry
on
you
and
your
government
and
a
thousand
new
patriots
will
be
enrolled
and
when
he
comes
out
from
his
torture
he
carry
on
the
work
of
hatred
and
vengeance
against
his
tyrants
he
will
fight
you
to
the
last
ditch
you
may
torture
his
body
but
you
can
not
break
his
heart
or
wither
his
spirit
they
beyond
you
they
they
she
stopped
suddenly
as
her
voice
rose
to
the
and
left
the
room
the
magistrate
went
down
the
drive
in
a
few
moments
was
on
his
way
to
the
a
closely
guarded
prisoner
angela
from
her
window
watched
the
men
disappear
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
moaned
as
she
had
not
done
since
her
mother
left
her
just
a
few
years
before
the
girlhood
in
her
was
dead
she
was
a
woman
the
one
great
note
had
come
to
her
transforming
her
whole
nature
love
and
the
man
she
loved
was
being
carried
away
to
the
misery
and
degradation
of
a
convict
gradually
the
moans
died
away
the
convulsive
heaving
of
her
breast
subsided
a
little
later
when
her
sister
monica
came
in
search
of
her
she
found
angela
in
a
dead
faint
by
night
she
was
in
a
fever

dublin

dear
lady
of
mercy
i
have
served
my
sentence
i
am
free
at
first
the
horrible
humiliation
of
my
treatment
of
my
surroundings
of
the
depths
i
had
to
sink
to
burned
into
me
then
the
thought
of
you
sustained
me
your
gentle
voice
your
beauty
your
pity
your
unbounded
faith
in
me
strengthened
my
soul
all
the
degradation
fell
from
me
they
were
but
ignoble
means
to
a
noble
end
i
was
tortured
that
others
might
never
know
sorrow
i
was
imprisoned
that
my
countrymen
might
know
liberty
and
so
the
load
was
lighter
the
memory
of
those
three
wonderful
days
was
so
marvellous
so
vivid
that
it
shone
like
a
star
through
the
blackness
of
those
terrible
days
you
seem
to
have
taken
hold
of
my
heart
and
my
soul
and
my
life
forgive
me
for
writing
this
to
you
but
it
seems
that
you
are
the
only
one
i
ever
known
who
understands
the
of
my
nature
of
my
hopes
and
my
ambitions
indeed
of
my
very
thoughts
i
met
the
leader
of
my
party
he
greeted
me
warmly
at
last
i
have
proved
myself
a
worthy
follower
they
think
it
best
i
should
leave
ireland
for
a
while
if
i
take
active
part
at
once
i
shall
be
arrested
again
and
sent
for
a
longer
sentence
they
have
offered
me
the
position
of
one
of
the
speakers
in
a
campaign
in
america
to
raise
funds
for
the
cause
i
must
first
see
the
chief
in
london
he
sent
a
message
writing
in
the
highest
terms
of
my
work
and
expressing
a
wish
to
meet
me
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
possible
to
see
you
in
london
if
i
am
sent
to
america
it
would
speed
my
going
to
speak
to
you
again
if
you
feel
that
i
ask
too
much
do
not
answer
this
and
i
will
understand
out
of
the
fulness
of
my
heart
from
the
depths
of
my
soul
and
with
the
whole
fervour
of
my
being
i
ask
you
to
accept
all
the
gratitude
of
a
heart
filled
to
overflowing
god
bless
and
keep
you
yours
in
homage
and
gratitude
frank
owen
london
my
dear
i
am
glad
indeed
to
have
your
letter
and
to
know
you
are
free
again
i
have
often
thought
of
your
misery
during
all
these
months
and
longed
to
do
something
to
assuage
it
it
is
only
when
a
friend
is
in
need
and
all
avenues
of
help
are
closed
to
him
that
a
woman
realises
how
helpless
she
is
that
they
have
not
crushed
your
spirit
does
not
surprise
me
i
was
as
sure
of
that
as
i
am
that
the
sun
is
shining
that
you
do
not
work
actively
in
ireland
at
once
is
i
am
sure
wise
foolhardiness
is
not
courage
in
a
little
while
the
english
government
may
realise
how
hopeless
it
is
to
try
and
conquer
a
people
who
have
liberty
in
their
hearts
then
they
will
abate
the
rigour
of
their
unjust
laws
when
that
day
comes
you
must
return
and
take
up
the
mission
with
renewed
strength
and
hope
and
stimulated
by
the
added
experience
of
bitter
suffering
i
should
most
certainly
like
to
see
you
in
london
i
am
staying
with
a
distant
connection
of
the
family
we
go
to
the
south
of
france
in
a
few
weeks
i
have
been
very
ill
another
reproach
to
the
weakness
of
woman
i
am
almost
recovered
now
but
far
from
strong
i
have
to
lie
still
all
day
my
only
companions
are
my
books
and
my
thoughts
let
me
know
when
you
expect
to
arrive
in
london
come
straight
here
i
have
so
much
to
tell
you
but
the
words
halt
as
they
come
to
my
pen
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
in
all
sincerity

chapter
x
visits
angela
in
london
nathaniel
kingsnorth
stayed
only
long
enough
in
ireland
to
permit
of
angela
recovery
he
only
went
into
the
once
when
angela
saw
him
come
into
the
room
she
turned
her
back
on
him
and
refused
to
speak
to
him
for
a
moment
a
flush
of
pity
for
his
young
sister
gave
him
a
pang
at
his
heart
she
looked
so
frail
and
worn
so
desperately
after
all
she
was
his
sister
and
again
had
she
not
been
punished
he
was
willing
to
forget
the
foolhardy
things
she
had
done
and
the
bitter
things
she
had
said
let
bygones
be
bygones
he
realised
that
he
had
neglected
her
he
would
do
so
no
longer
far
from
it
when
they
returned
to
london
all
that
would
be
remedied
he
would
take
care
of
her
in
every
possible
way
he
felt
a
genuine
thrill
course
through
him
as
he
thought
of
his
generosity
to
all
of
this
angela
made
no
answer
stung
by
her
silence
he
left
the
room
and
sent
for
his
other
sister
when
monica
came
he
told
her
that
whenever
angela
wished
to
recognise
his
magnanimity
she
could
send
for
him
she
would
not
find
him
unforgiving
to
this
angela
sent
no
reply
when
the
fever
had
passed
and
she
was
stronger
arrangements
were
made
for
the
journey
to
london
as
angela
walked
unsteadily
to
the
carriage
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
nurse
nathaniel
came
forward
to
assist
her
she
passed
him
without
a
word
nor
did
she
speak
to
him
once
nor
answer
any
remark
of
his
during
the
long
journey
on
the
train
when
they
reached
london
she
refused
to
go
to
the
kingsnorth
house
where
her
brother
lived
but
went
at
once
to
a
distant
cousin
of
her
mother
wrexford
and
made
her
home
with
her
as
she
had
often
done
before
she
refused
to
hold
any
further
communication
with
her
brother
despite
the
ministrations
of
her
sister
monica
and
wrexford
wrexford
was
a
gentle
little
widow
whose
only
happiness
in
life
seemed
to
be
in
worrying
over
others
misfortunes
she
was
on
the
board
of
various
charitable
organisations
and
was
a
busy
helper
in
the
field
of
mercy
she
worshipped
angela
as
she
had
her
mother
before
her
that
something
serious
had
occurred
between
angela
and
her
brother
wrexford
realised
but
she
could
find
out
nothing
by
questioning
angela
every
time
she
asked
her
anything
relative
to
her
attitude
angela
was
silent
one
day
she
begged
wrexford
never
to
speak
of
her
brother
again
wrexford
respected
her
wishes
and
watched
her
and
nursed
her
through
her
convalescence
with
a
tender
solicitude
when
letter
came
angela
showed
it
to
wrexford
together
with
her
reply
do
you
mind
if
i
see
him
here
angela
asked
what
kind
of
man
is
he
the
kind
that
heroes
are
made
of
he
writes
so
strangely
may
one
say
unreservedly
is
he
a
gentleman
in
the
real
meaning
of
the
word
yes
of
good
family
not
as
we
estimate
goodness
his
family
were
just
simple
peasants
do
you
think
it
wise
to
see
him
i
do
consider
the
wisdom
i
only
listen
to
my
heart
do
you
mean
that
you
care
for
him
i
do
you
you
love
him
so
much
of
love
as
i
can
give
is
his
oh
my
dear
cried
wrexford
thoroughly
alarmed
do
be
afraid
said
angela
quietly
our
ways
lie
wide
apart
he
is
working
for
the
biggest
thing
in
life
his
work
is
his
life
i
am
nothing
but
do
you
think
it
would
be
indiscreet
dear
to
have
such
a
man
come
here
why
indiscreet
a
man
who
has
been
in
prison
and
wrexford
shuddered
at
the
thought
she
had
seen
and
helped
so
many
poor
victims
of
the
cruel
laws
and
the
memory
of
their
drawn
faces
and
evil
eyes
and
coarse
speech
flashed
across
her
mind
she
could
not
reconcile
one
coming
into
her
little
home
angela
answered
her
yes
he
has
been
in
prison
but
the
shame
was
for
his
persecutors
not
for
him
still
if
you
would
rather
i
saw
him
somewhere
else
oh
no
my
dear
child
if
you
wish
it
i
do
i
just
want
to
see
him
again
as
he
writes
he
does
me
i
want
to
hear
him
speak
again
i
want
to
wish
him
on
his
journey
very
well
angela
said
the
old
lady
as
you
wish
a
week
afterwards
arrived
in
london
they
met
in
wrexford
little
in
mayfair
they
looked
at
each
other
for
some
moments
without
speaking
both
noted
the
fresh
lines
of
suffering
in
each
other
faces
they
had
been
through
the
long
valley
of
the
shadow
of
sorrow
since
they
had
last
met
but
thought
as
he
looked
at
her
that
all
the
suffering
he
had
gone
through
passed
from
him
as
some
hideous
dream
it
was
worth
it
these
months
of
torture
just
to
be
looking
at
her
now
worth
the
long
black
nights
the
labours
in
the
heat
of
the
day
with
outcasts
around
him
the
taunts
of
his
gaolers
worth
all
the
infamy
of
it
just
to
stand
there
looking
at
her
she
had
taken
his
life
in
her
two
little
hands
he
had
bathed
his
soul
all
these
months
in
the
thought
of
her
he
had
prayed
night
and
day
that
he
might
see
her
standing
near
him
just
as
she
was
then
see
the
droop
of
her
eye
and
the
silk
of
her
hair
and
feel
the
touch
of
her
hand
and
hear
the
exquisite
tenderness
of
her
voice
he
stood
mute
before
her
she
held
out
her
hand
and
said
simply
thank
you
for
coming
it
was
good
of
you
to
let
me
he
answered
hoarsely
they
have
not
broken
your
spirit
or
your
courage
no
he
replied
tensely
they
are
the
stronger
i
thought
they
would
be
she
said
proudly
all
the
while
he
was
looking
at
the
pale
face
and
the
thin
transparency
of
her
hands
but
you
have
suffered
too
you
have
been
ill
were
you
in
danger
his
voice
had
a
catch
of
fear
in
it
as
he
asked
the
to
him
terrible
question
no
it
was
just
a
fever
it
is
past
i
am
a
little
weak
a
little
tired
that
will
pass
too
if
anything
had
happened
to
you
or
ever
should
happen
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
moaned
oh
my
god
oh
my
god
his
body
shook
with
the
sobs
he
tried
vainly
to
check
angela
put
her
hand
gently
on
his
shoulder
do
do
that
she
whispered
he
controlled
himself
with
an
effort
it
will
be
over
in
a
moment
just
a
moment
i
am
sorry
he
suddenly
knelt
at
her
feet
his
head
bowed
in
reverence
god
help
me
he
cried
faintly
i
love
you
i
love
you
she
looked
down
at
him
her
face
transfigured
he
loved
her
the
beat
of
her
heart
spoke
it
he
loves
you
the
throbbing
of
her
brain
shouted
it
he
loves
you
the
cry
of
her
soul
whispered
it
he
loves
you
she
stretched
out
her
hands
to
him
my
love
is
yours
just
as
yours
is
mine
let
us
join
our
lives
and
give
them
to
the
suffering
and
the
oppressed
he
looked
up
at
her
in
wonder
i
dare
think
what
i
am
you
are
the
best
that
is
in
me
we
are
mates
a
peasant
a
beggar
you
are
the
noblest
of
the
noble
a
convict
our
saviour
was
crucified
so
that
his
people
should
be
redeemed
you
have
given
the
pain
of
your
body
so
that
your
people
may
be
free
it
would
be
fair
to
you
he
pleaded
if
you
leave
me
it
will
be
unfair
to
us
both
oh
my
dear
one
my
dear
one
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
i
give
the
best
of
my
days
to
guard
you
and
protect
you
and
bring
you
happiness
i
am
happy
now
and
her
voice
died
to
a
whisper
chapter
xi
kingsnorth
in
despair
three
days
afterwards
nathaniel
kingsnorth
returned
late
at
night
from
a
political
banquet
it
had
been
a
great
evening
at
last
it
seemed
that
life
was
about
to
give
him
what
he
most
wished
for
his
dearest
ambitions
were
apparently
about
to
be
realised
he
had
been
called
on
as
a
staunch
conservative
to
add
his
quota
to
the
already
wonderful
array
of
brilliant
perorations
of
seasoned
statesmen
and
admirable
speakers
kingsnorth
had
excelled
himself
never
had
he
spoken
so
powerfully
being
one
of
the
only
men
at
the
banquet
who
had
enjoyed
even
a
brief
glimpse
of
ireland
he
made
the
solution
of
the
irish
question
the
main
topic
of
his
speech
speaking
lucidly
and
earnestly
he
placed
before
them
his
panacea
for
irish
ills
his
hearers
were
enthralled
when
he
sat
down
the
cheering
was
prolonged
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
an
old
friend
of
his
late
father
spoke
most
glowingly
to
him
and
of
him
in
his
hearing
the
junior
whip
hinted
at
his
contesting
a
heat
at
a
coming
in
the
north
of
ireland
a
man
with
his
knowledge
of
ireland
as
he
had
shown
that
night
would
be
invaluable
to
his
party
when
he
left
the
gathering
he
was
in
a
condition
of
ecstasy
lying
back
amid
the
cushions
during
his
long
drive
home
he
closed
his
eyes
and
pictured
the
future
his
imagination
ran
riot
it
took
wings
and
flew
from
height
to
height
he
saw
himself
the
leader
of
a
party
the
kingsnorth
party
controlling
his
followers
with
a
hand
of
iron
and
driving
them
to
vote
according
to
his
judgment
and
his
decree
by
the
time
he
reached
home
he
had
entered
the
cabinet
and
was
being
spoken
of
as
the
probable
prime
minister
but
for
the
sudden
stopping
of
the
horses
he
might
have
attained
that
proud
distinction
the
pleasant
warmth
of
the
entrance
hall
on
this
chill
november
night
greeted
him
as
a
benignant
welcome
he
bummed
a
tune
cheerfully
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
and
was
smiling
genially
when
he
entered
the
massive
study
he
poured
out
a
liqueur
and
stood
sipping
it
as
he
turned
over
the
letters
brought
by
the
night
post
one
arrested
him
it
had
been
delivered
by
hand
and
was
marked
most
urgent
he
lit
a
cigar
and
tore
open
the
envelope
as
he
read
the
letter
every
vestige
of
colour
left
his
face
he
sank
into
a
chair
the
letter
slipped
from
his
fingers
all
his
dreams
had
vanished
in
a
moment
his
house
of
cards
had
toppled
down
his
ambitions
were
surely
and
positively
destroyed
at
one
stroke
he
mechanically
picked
up
the
letter
and
it
had
it
been
his
it
could
not
have
affected
him
more
cruelly
dear
nathaniel
i
scarcely
know
how
to
write
to
you
about
what
has
happened
i
am
afraid
i
am
in
some
small
measure
to
blame
ten
days
ago
your
sister
showed
me
a
letter
from
a
man
named
kingsnorth
crushed
the
letter
in
his
hand
as
he
read
the
hated
name
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
caused
him
so
much
discomfort
during
that
unfortunate
visit
to
his
estate
in
ireland
how
he
blamed
himself
now
for
having
ever
gone
there
there
was
indeed
a
curse
on
it
for
the
kingsnorths
he
straightened
out
the
crumpled
piece
of
paper
and
read
on
a
man
named
the
man
she
nursed
in
your
house
in
ireland
after
he
had
been
shot
by
the
soldiers
he
was
coming
to
england
and
wished
to
see
her
she
asked
my
permission
i
reasoned
with
her
but
she
was
decided
if
i
should
not
permit
her
to
see
him
in
my
house
she
would
meet
him
elsewhere
it
seemed
better
the
meeting
should
be
under
my
roof
so
i
consented
i
bitterly
reproach
myself
now
for
not
acquainting
you
with
the
particulars
you
might
have
succeeded
in
stopping
what
has
happened
your
sister
and
were
married
this
morning
by
special
licence
and
left
this
afternoon
for
liverpool
en
route
to
america
i
can
not
begin
to
tell
you
how
much
i
deplore
the
unfortunate
affair
it
will
always
be
a
lasting
sorrow
to
me
i
can
not
write
any
more
now
my
head
is
aching
with
the
thought
of
what
it
will
mean
to
you
try
not
to
think
too
hardly
of
me
and
believe
me
always

at

moment
he
could
have
killed

humiliation
of
it
the
degradation
of
it
married
to
that
lawless
irish
agitator
the
man
now
a
member
of
his
family
a
cry
of
misery
broke
from
him
as
he
realised
that
the
best
years
of
his
life
were
to
come
and
go
fruitlessly
his
career
was
ended
despair

angela
confession
a
year
after
the
events
in
the
preceding
book
took
place
and
his
young
wife
were
living
in
a
small
apartment
in
one
of
the
poorer
sections
of
new
york
city
the
first
few
months
in
america
had
been
glorious
ones
for
them
their
characters
and
natures
unfolded
to
each
other
as
some
wonderful
paintings
each
taking
its
own
hues
from
the
adoration
of
the
other
in
company
with
a
noted
irish
organiser
had
spoken
in
many
of
the
big
cities
of
the
united
states
and
was
everywhere
hailed
as
a
hero
and
a
martyr
to
english
tyranny
but
he
had
one
handicap
a
drawback
he
had
never
felt
during
the
years
of
struggle
preceding
his
marriage
his
means
were
indeed
small
he
tried
to
eke
out
a
little
income
writing
articles
for
the
newspapers
and
magazines
but
the
recompense
was
pitiful
he
could
not
bear
without
a
pang
to
see
angela
in
the
dingy
surroundings
that
he
could
barely
afford
to
provide
for
her
on
her
part
angela
took
nothing
with
her
but
a
few
jewels
her
mother
had
left
her
some
clothes
and
very
little
money
the
money
soon
disappeared
and
then
one
by
one
the
keepsakes
of
her
mother
were
parted
with
but
they
never
lost
heart
through
it
all
they
were
happy
all
the
poetry
of
nature
came
uppermost
leavened
as
it
was
by
the
deep
faith
and
veneration
of
his
wife
this
strangely
assorted
fervent
man
and
gentle
woman
seemed
to
have
solved
the
great
mystery
of
happiness
between
two
people
but
the
poverty
chafed
not
for
himself
but
for
the
frail
loving
uncomplaining
woman
who
had
given
her
life
into
his
care
his
active
brain
was
continually
trying
to
devise
new
ways
of
adding
to
his
meagre
income
he
multiplied
his
duties
he
worked
far
into
the
night
when
he
could
find
a
demand
for
his
articles
but
little
by
little
his
sources
of
revenue
failed
him
some
fresh
and
horrible
agrarian
crimes
in
ireland
for
which
the
home
rule
party
were
blamed
for
a
while
turned
the
tide
of
sympathy
against
his
party
the
order
was
sent
out
to
discontinue
meetings
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
funds
in
america
funds
the
had
been
so
cheerfully
and
plentifully
bestowing
on
the
cause
was
recalled
to
ireland
his
work
was
highly
commended
some
day
they
would
send
him
to
the
united
states
again
as
a
special
pleader
at
present
he
would
be
of
greater
value
at
home
he
was
instructed
to
apply
to
the
treasurer
of
the
fund
and
arrangements
would
be
made
for
his
passage
back
to
ireland
he
brought
the
news
to
angela
with
a
strange
feeling
of
fear
and
disappointment
he
had
built
so
much
on
making
a
wonderful
career
in
the
great
new
world
and
returning
home
some
day
to
ireland
with
the
means
of
relieving
some
of
her
misery
and
with
his
wife
guarded
as
she
should
be
from
the
possibility
of
want
and
here
was
he
going
back
to
ireland
as
poor
as
he
left
it
though
richer
immeasurably
in
the
love
of
angela
she
was
sitting
perfectly
still
her
eyes
on
the
floor
when
he
entered
the
room
he
came
in
so
softly
that
she
did
not
hear
him
he
lifted
her
head
and
looked
into
her
eyes
he
noticed
with
certainty
what
had
been
so
far
only
a
vague
dread
her
face
was
very
very
pale
and
transparent
her
eyes
were
sunken
and
had
a
strange
brilliancy
she
was
much
slighter
end
far
more
ethereal
than
on
that
day
when
they
stood
the
deck
of
the
ship
and
turned
their
faces
so
hopefully
to
the
new
world
he
felt
a
stab
startle
through
his
blood
to
his
heart
his
breath
caught
angela
looked
up
at
him
radiantly
he
kissed
her
and
with
mock
cheerfulness
he
said
laughingly
such
news
me
darlin
such
wondherful
news
good
news
dear
the
best
in
the
wurrld
and
he
choked
a
sob
i
knew
it
would
come
i
knew
it
would
tell
me
dear
we
to
go
back
back
to
back
to
ireland
see
here
are
the
orders
and
he
showed
her
the
official
letter
she
took
it
wonderingly
and
read
it
her
hand
dropped
to
her
side
her
head
drooped
into
the
same
position
he
had
found
her
in
in
a
moment
he
was
kneeling
at
her
side
what
is
it
dear
we
ca

frank
we
ca

repeated
her
body
crumpled
up
limply
in
the
chair
and

a
moment
she
went
on
but
we
go

ca

oh
my
dear
my
dear
ca

she
looked
imploringly
into
his
eyes
a
new
wonder
came
into
his
could
it
be
true
could
it
he
took
both
her
hands
and
held
them
tightly
and
stood
up
towering
over
her
and
trembling
violently
is
it
is
it
he
cried
and
stopped
as
if
afraid
to
complete
the
question
she
smiled
a
wan
smile
up
at
him
and
nodded
her
head
as
she
answered
the
union
of
our
lives
is
to
be
complete
our
love
is
to
be
rewarded
a
child
is
coming
to
us
he
whispered
it
is
and
her
voice
was
hushed
too
praise
be
to
god
praise
be
to
his
holy
name
and
clasped
his
hands

while

on
it

the
telling

wanted
to

different
i
wanted
you
when
you
heard
it
to
be
free

and
i
waited
from
day
to
day
hoping
for
the
best
that
some
good
fortune
would
come
to
you
he
forced
one
of
his
old
time
hearty
laughs
but
there
was
a
hollow
ring
in
it
what
is
that
yer
sayin
at
all
wait
for
good
fortune
is
there
any
good
fortune
like
what

times

arm
around
her
and
sitting
beside

drew
her
closely
to
him

his
voice

with
a
note
of
agony

the
doctor

said

my
little
mother
my
precious
little
mother
he
cradled
her
in
his
strong
arms
and
together
they
sat
for
hours
and
the
pall
of
his
poverty
fell
from
them
and
they
pictured
the
future
and
crowned
with
gold
a
future
in
which
there
were
three
the
trinity
one
and
undivided
presently
she
fell
asleep
in
his
arms
he
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
prayed
god
to
help
him
in
his
hour
of
striving
he
prayed
that
the
little
life
sleeping
so
calmly
in
his
arms
would
be
spared
him
oh
god
answer
my
prayer
i
beseech
you
he
cried
angela
smiled
contentedly
in
her
sleep
and
spoke
his
same
it
seemed
to
as
if
his
prayer
had
been
heard
and
answered
he
gathered
the
slight
form
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
her
room
and
sat
by
her
until
dawn
it
was
the
first
night
for
many
weeks
that
she
had
slept
through
till
morning
without
starting
out
of
her
sleep
in
pain
this
night
she
slumbered
like
a
child
and
a
smile
played
on
her
lips
as
though
her
dreams
were
happy
ones
chapter
ii
a
communication
from
nathaniel
kingsnorth
the
months
that
followed
were
the
hardest
in
life
strive
as
he
would
he
could
find
no
really
remunerative
employment
he
had
no
special
training
he
knew
no
trade
his
pen
though
fluent
was
not
cultured
and
lacked
the
glow
of
eloquence
he
had
when
speaking
he
worked
in
shops
and
in
factories
he
tried
to
report
on
newspapers
but
his
lack
of
experience
everywhere
handicapped
him
what
he
contrived
to
earn
during
those
months
of
struggle
was
all
too
little
as
the
time
approached
for
the
great
event
angela
was
now
entirely
confined
to
her
bed
she
seemed
to
grow
more
every
day
a
terrible
dread
haunted
waking
and
sleeping
he
would
start
out
of
some
terrible
dream
at
night
and
listen
to
her
breathing
when
he
would
hurry
back
at
the
close
of
some
long
disappointing
day
his
heart
would
be
hammering
dully
with
fear
for
his
loved
one
as
the
months
wore
on
his
face
became
lined
with
care
and
the
bright
gold
of
his
hair
dimmed
with
streaks
of
silver
but
he
never
faltered
or
lost
courage
he
always
felt
he
must
win
the
fight
now
for
existence
as
he
meant
to
win
the
greater
conflict
later
for
liberty
angela
lying
so
still
through
the
long
days
could
only
hope
she
felt
so
helpless
it
was
woman
weakness
that
brought
men
like
to
the
edge
of
despair
and
hers
was
not
merely
bodily
weakness
but
the
mare
poignant
one
of
pride
was
it
fair
to
her
husband
was
it
just
in
england
she
had
prosperous
relatives
they
would
not
let
her
die
in
her
misery
they
could
not
let
her
baby
come
into
the
world
with
poverty
as
its
only
inheritance
till
now
she
had
been
unable
to
master
her
feeling
of
hatred
and
bitterness
for
her
brother
nathaniel
her
intense
dislike
and
contempt
for
her
sister
monica
from
the
time
she
left
england
she
had
not
written
to
either
of
them
could
she
now
something
decided
her
one
night
came
back
disheartened
try
as
he
would
he
could
not
conceal
it
he
was
getting
to
the
end
of
his
courage
there
was
insufficient
work
at
the
shop
he
had
been
working
in
for
several
weeks
he
had
been
told
he
need
not
come
again
angela
lying
motionless
and
white
tried
to
comfort
him
and
give
him
heart
she
made
up
her
mind
that
night
the
next
day
she
wrote
to
her
brother
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
express
one
regret
for
what
she
had
done
or
said
on
the
contrary
she
made
many
references
to
her
happiness
with
the
man
she
loved
she
did
write
of
the
hardships
they
were
passing
through
but
they
were
only
temporary
was
so
clever
so
brilliant
he
must
win
in
the
end
only
just
now
she
was
she
needed
help
she
asked
no
gift
a
loan
merely
they
would
pay
it
back
when
the
days
of
plenty
came
she
would
not
ask
even
this
were
it
not
that
she
was
not
only
ill
but
the
one
great
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
was
to
be
vouchsafed
her
motherhood
in
the
name
of
her
unborn
baby
she
begged
him
to
send
an
immediate
response
she
asked
a
neighbour
to
post
the
letter
so
that
would
not
know
of
her
sacrifice
she
waited
anxiously
for
a
reply
some
considerable
time
afterwards
on
the
eve
of
her
travail
and
when
things
with
were
at
their
worst
the
answer
came
by
cable
she
was
alone
when
it
came
her
heart
beat
furiously
as
she
opened
it
even
if
he
only
sent
a
little
it
would
be
so
welcome
now
when
they
were
almost
at
the
end
if
he
had
been
generous
how
wonderful
it
would
be
for
her
to
help
the
man
to
whom
nothing
was
too
much
to
give
her
the
fact
that
her
brother
had
cabled
strengthened
the
belief
that
he
had
hastened
to
come
to
her
rescue
she
opened
the
cable
and
read
it
then
she
fell
back
on
the
pillow
with
a
low
faint
moan
when
hours
later
returned
from
a
vain
search
for
work
he
found
her
senseless
with
the
cable
in
her
fingers
he
tried
to
recover
her
without
success
he
sent
a
neighbour
for
a
doctor
as
he
watched
the
worn
patient
face
his
heart
full
to
bursting
the
thought
flashed
through
him
what
could
have
happened
to
cause
this
collapse
he
became
conscious
of
the
cable
he
had
found
tightly
clasped
in
her
hand
he
picked
it
up
and
read
it
it
was
very
brief

have
made
your
bed
lie
in

chapter
iii
the
birth
of
peg
toward
morning
the
doctor
placed
a
little
mite
of
humanity
in
arms
he
looked
down
at
it
in
a
stupor
it
had
really
come
to
pass
their
child
angela
and
his
a
little
the
tiny
wail
from
this
child
born
of
love
and
in
sorrow
seemed
to
waken
his
dull
senses
he
pressed
the
mite
to
him
as
the
hot
tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
a
woman
in
one
of
the
adjoining
flats
who
had
kindly
offered
to
help
took
the
child
away
from
him
the
doctor
led
him
to
the
bedside
he
looked
down
at
his
loved
one
a
glaze
was
over
eyes
as
she
looked
up
at
him
she
tried
to
smile
all
her
suffering
was
forgotten
she
knew
only
pride
and
love
she
was
at
peace
she
raised
her
hand
thin
and
transparent
now
to
he
pressed
it
to
his
lips
she
whispered
my
baby
bring
me
my
baby
he
took
it
from
the
woman
and
placed
it
in
angela
weak
arms
she
kissed
it
again
and
again
the
child
wailed
pitifully
the
effort
had
been
too
much
for
angela
failing
strength
consciousness
left
her
just
before
sunrise
she
woke
was
sitting
beside
her
he
had
never
moved
the
infant
was
sleeping
on
some
blankets
on
the
couch
the
woman
watching
her
angela
motioned
her
husband
to
bend
near
to
her
her
eyes
shone
with
unearthly
brightness
he
put
his
ear
near
her
lips
her
voice
was
very
very
faint
take
care
of
our
baby
frank
i
i
leaving
you
god
help
you
and
keep
you
and
bless
you
for
your
love
of
me
she
paused
to
take
breath
then
she
whispered
her
the
words
never
left
memory
for
all
the
days
of
all
the
years
that
followed
my
last
words
dear
the
last
i
ever
speak
to
you
i
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
my
soul
husband
good
frank
she
slipped
from
his
arms
and
lay
lips
parted
eyes
open
body
still
the
struggle
was
over
she
had
gone
where
there
are
no
petty
treacheries
no
mean
brutalities
where
all
stand
alike
before
the
throne
to
render
an
account
of
their
stewardship
the
brave
gentle
little
heart
was
stilled
forever

appears
for
the
first
time
and
brings
her
radiant
presence
her
roguish
smile
her
big
frank
soulful
blue
eyes
her
dazzling
red

her
direct
honest
and
outspoken

her
love
of

enters
our

and
turns
what
was
a
history
of
romance
and
drama
into
a
comedy
of

pure
as
a

peg
o

comes
into
our
story
even
as
she
entered
her
father
life
as
the
saviour
of
these
pages
even
as
she
was
the
means
of
saving
and
she
did
save
her
father
it
was
the
presence
and
the
thought
of
the
little
motherless
baby
that
kept
hand
from
destroying
himself
when
his
reason
almost
left
him
after
his
wife
death
the
memories
of
the
days
immediately
following
the
passing
of
angela
are
too
painful
to
dwell
upon
they
are
past
they
are
sacred
in
heart
they
will
be
to
the
historian
thanks
to
some
kindly
irishmen
who
heard
of
plight
he
borrowed
enough
money
to
bury
his
dead
wife
and
place
a
tablet
to
her
memory
he
sent
a
message
to
kingsnorth
telling
him
of
his
sister
death
he
neither
expected
nor
did
he
receive
an
answer
as
soon
as
it
was
possible
he
returned
to
ireland
and
threw
himself
once
again
heart
and
soul
into
working
for
the
cause
he
realised
his
only
hope
of
keeping
his
balance
was
to
work
he
went
back
to
the
little
village
he
was
born
in
and
it
was
father
cahill
hands
that
poured
the
baptismal
waters
on
and
angela
baby
and
it
was
father
cahill
voice
that
read
the
baptismal
service
she
was
christened
margaret
angela
one
night
when
it
was
nearing
her
time
begged
him
if
it
were
a
girl
to
christen
her
margaret
after
her
mother
since
all
the
best
in
angela
came
from
her
mother
would
have
liked
to
have
named
the
mite
angela
but
his
dead
wife
wishes
were
paramount
so
margaret
the
baby
was
christened
it
was
too
distinguished
a
name
and
too
long
for
such
a
little
bundle
of
pink
and
white
humanity
it
did
not
seem
to
fit
her
so
peg
she
was
named
and
peg
she
remained
for
the
rest
of
her
life
when
she
was
old
enough
to
go
with
him
took
peg
everywhere
he
seemed
to
bear
a
charmed
life
when
she
was
with
him
peg
earliest
memories
are
of
the
village
where
she
was
baptised
and
where
her
father
was
born
her
little
will
was
law
to
everyone
who
came
in
contact
with
her
she
ruled
her
little
court
with
a
hand
of
iron
many
were
the
dire
predictions
of
the
rod
was
making
for
his
own
back
in
giving
the
little
mite
her
own
way
in
everything
but
only
happiness
was
in
peg
and
he
neither
heard
nor
cared
about
any
criticism
that
may
have
been
levelled
at
him
for
his
fond
and
perhaps
foolish
care
of
her
looming
large
in
peg
memories
in
after
life
are
her
father
showing
her
kernan
hill
and
pointing
out
the
mount
on
which
he
stood
and
spoke
that
day
whilst
her
mother
hidden
by
that
dense
mass
of
trees
saw
every
movement
and
heard
every
word
from
there
he
took
her
to
the
gap
and
pointed
out
the
windows
of
the
room
in
which
he
was
nursed
for
those
three
blessed
days
it
eased
his
mind
to
talk
to
the
child
of
angela
and
always
he
pictured
her
as
the
poet
writes
in
verse
of
the
passion
of
his
life
as
the
painter
puts
on
canvas
the
features
that
make
life
worth
the
living
for
him
those
memories
were
very
clear
in
little
peg
mind
then
somehow
her
childish
thoughts
all
seemed
to
run
to
home
rule
to
love
of
ireland
and
hatred
of
england
to
thinking
all
that
was
good
of
irishmen
and
all
that
was
bad
of
englishmen
why
do
yez
hate
the
english
so
much
father
she
asked
once
looking
up
at
him
with
a
puzzled
look
in
her
big
blue
eyes
and
the
most
adorable
brogue
coming
fresh
from
her
tongue
why
do
yez
hate
them
she
repeated
i
good
cause
to
peg
me
darlin
he
answered
and
a
deep
frown
gathered
on
his
brow
sure
was
me
mother
english
peg
asked
she
was
then
why
do
yez
hate
the
english
it
take
a
long
time
to
tell
ye
that
peggy
some
day
i
will
there
many
a
reason
why
the
irish
hate
the
english
and
many
a
good
reason
too
but
there
one
why
you
and
i
should
hate
them
and
hate
them
with
all
the
bittherness
that
in
us
and
what
is
it
said
peg
curiously
i
tell
ye
when
yer
mother
and
i
were
almost
starvin
and
she
lyin
on
a
bed
of
sickness
she
wrote
to
an
englishman
and
asked
him
to
assist
her
an
this
is
the
reply
she
got
made
yer
bed

in
it
that
was
the
answer
she
got
the
day
before
you
were
born
and
she
died
givin
ye
life
and
by
the
same
token
the
man
that
wrote
that
shameful
message
to
a
dyin
woman
was
her
own
brother
her

peg
wrathfully

all
his

fiercely
to

mother
that
and
she
dyin
faith
i
like
to
see
him
some
day
just
meet
him
and
tell
him
she
stopped
her
little
fingers
clenched
into
a
miniature
fist
the
hot
colour
was
in
her
cheeks
and
she
stamped
her
small
foot
in
actual
rage
i
like
to
meet
him
some
day
she
muttered
i
hope
ye
never
will
peg
said
her
father
solemnly
and
he
added
do
let
us
ever
talk
of
it
again
me
darlin
and
she
never
did
but
she
often
thought
of
the
incident
and
the
memory
of
that
brutal
message
was
stamped
vividly
on
her
little
brain
the
greatest
excitements
of
her
young
life
were
going
with
her
father
to
hear
him
speak
she
made
the
most
extraordinary
collection
of
scraps
of
the
speeches
she
had
heard
her
father
make
for
home
rule
while
he
would
be
speaking
she
would
listen
intently
her
lips
apart
her
little
body
tense
with
excitement
her
little
heart
beating
like
a
when
they
applauded
him
she
would
laugh
gleefully
and
clap
her
little
hands
together
if
they
interrupted
him
she
would
turn
savagely
upon
them
she
became
known
all
over
the
countryside
as
peg
sure
not
the
same
man
at
all
at
all
since
he
came
back
with
that
little
bit
of
a
child
said
a
man
to
father
cahill
one
day
god
is
good
flaherty
replied
the
priest
he
sent
a
baby
to
take
him
up
nearer
to
himself
ye
right
he
not
the
same
man
it
the
good
catholic
he
is
again
as
he
was
as
a
boy
an
it
thankful
for
that
same
father
cahill
smiled
happily
he
was
much
older
but
though
the
figure
was
a
little
bent
and
the
hair
thinner
and
the
remainder
of
it
the
same
sturdy
spirit
was
in
the
old
man
they
like
boy
and
girl
together
that
what
they
are
said
flaherty
with
a
tone
of
regret
in
his
voice
he
seems
as
much
of
a
child
as
she
is
when
he
with
her
he
added
every
good
man
has
somethin
of
the
child
left
in
him
me
son
was
goin
in
the
way
of
darkness
until
a
woman
hand
guided
him
and
gave
him
that
little
baby
to
hold
on
to
his
heart
strings
sure
peg
the
light
o
his
life
that
what
she
is
grumbled
flaherty
it
small
chance
we
ever
have
of
broken
heads
an
soldiers
firin
on
us
an
all
through
since
that
child
laid
hands
on
him
flaherty
sighed
them
was
grand
days
and
all
he
said
they
were
wicked
days
flaherty
said
the
priest
severely
and
surprised
i
am
that
a
man
like
yerself
should
wish
them
back
there
are
times
when
i
do
father
the
lord
forgive
me
a
fight
lets
the
bad
blood
out
of
ye
sure
it
was
a
pike
or
a
gun
shouldher
in
the
ould
days
and
no
one
to
say
him
nay
and
we
all
following
him
like
the
colonel
of
a
regiment
an
proud
to
do
it
too
but
now
it
only
the
soft
words
we
get
from
him
a
child
hand
shall
guide
said
the
priest
then
he
added
it
has
guided
him
whenever
ye
get
them
wicked
thoughts
about
shouldherin
a
gun
and
flashin
a
pike
come
round
to
confession
flaherty
and
it
the
good
penance
i
give
ye
to
dhrive
the
temptation
away
from
ye
i
will
that
father
cahill
said
flaherty
hurriedly
and
the
men
went
their
different
ways
did
everything
for
peg
since
she
was
an
infant
his
were
the
only
hands
to
tend
the
little
body
to
wash
her
and
dress
her
and
tie
up
her
little
and
sit
beside
her
in
her
childish
sicknesses
he
taught
her
to
read
and
to
write
and
to
pray
as
she
grew
bigger
he
taught
her
the
little
he
knew
of
music
and
the
great
deal
he
knew
of
poetry
he
instilled
a
love
of
verse
into
her
little
mind
he
never
tired
of
reading
her
tom
moore
and
teaching
her
his
melodies
he
would
make
her
learn
them
and
she
would
stand
up
solemnly
and
recite
or
sing
them
her
quaint
little
brogue
giving
them
an
added
music
and
peg
were
inseparable
one
wonderful
year
came
to
peg
when
she
was
about
fourteen
had
become
recognised
as
a
masterly
exponent
of
the
particular
form
of
land
act
that
would
most
benefit
ireland
it
was
proposed
that
he
should
lecture
right
through
the
country
wherever
they
would
let
him
and
awaken
amongst
the
more
violent
irish
the
recognition
that
legislative
means
were
surer
of
securing
the
end
in
view
than
the
more
violent
ones
of
fifteen
years
before
the
brutality
of
the
coercion
act
had
been
moderated
and
already
the
agricultural
and
dairy
produce
of
the
country
had
developed
so
remarkably
that
the
terrible
misery
of
days
when
the
would
fail
had
been
practically
eliminated
or
at
least
in
many
districts
mitigated
accepted
the
proposition
through
the
country
he
went
speaking
in
every
village
he
passed
through
and
sometimes
giving
several
lectures
in
the
big
cities
his
mode
of
travelling
was
in
a
cart
he
would
speak
from
the
back
of
it
peg
sitting
at
his
feet
now
watching
him
again
looking
eagerly
and
intently
at
the
strange
faces
before
her
they
were
marvellous
days
travelling
sometimes
under
a
golden
sun
through
the
glistening
fields
or
pushing
on
at
night
under
a
great
moon
peg
would
sit
beside
her
father
as
he
drove
and
he
would
tell
her
little
or
sing
wild
snatches
of
songs
of
the
days
of
the
rebellion
or
quote
lines
ringing
with
the
great
irish
confidence
in
the
triumph
of
justice
lo
the
path
we
tread
by
our
martyred
dead
has
been
trodden
bane
and
blessing
but
unconquered
still
is
the
steadfast
will
and
the
faith
they
died
confessing
or
at
night
he
would
croon
from
moore
when
the
drowsy
world
is
dreaming
love
then
awake
the
heavens
look
bright
my
dear
is
never
too
late
for
delight
my
dear
and
the
best
of
all
ways
to
lengthen
our
days
is
to
steal
a
few
hours
from
the
night
my
dear
when
storms
would
come
she
would
cower
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
cart
and
cry
and
pray
storms
terrified
her
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
anger
of
the
heavens
were
levelled
at
her
she
would
cry
and
moan
pitifully
whilst
would
try
to
soothe
her
and
tell
her
that
neither
god
nor
man
would
harm
her
no
one
would
touch
his
peg
o
my
heart
after
one
of
those
scenes
he
would
sit
and
brood
angela
had
always
been
afraid
of
storms
and
in
the
child
terror
his
beloved
wife
would
rise
up
before
him
and
the
big
tears
would
drop
silently
down
his
cheeks
peg
crept
out
once
when
the
storm
had
cleared
and
the
sky
was
bright
with
stars
her
father
did
not
hear
her
his
thoughts
were
bridging
over
the
years
and
once
more
angela
was
beside
him
peg
touched
him
timidly
and
peered
up
into
his
face
she
thought
his
cheeks
were
wet
but
that
could
not
be
she
had
never
seen
her
father
cry
what
are
ye
thinkin
about
father
she
whispered
his
voice
broke
he
did
not
want
her
to
see
his
emotion
he
answered
with
a
thinkin
about
is
it
it
ashamed
i
am
of
ye
to
be
frightened
by
a
few
little
flashes
of
lightnin
and
the
beautiful
grand
thundher
that
always
kapes
it
company
it
ashamed
i
am
of
ye
that
what
i
am
he
spoke
almost
roughly
to
hide
his
emotion
and
he
furtively
wiped
the
tears
from
his
face
so
that
she
should
not
see
them
it
not
the
lightnin
i
afraid
of
father
said
peg
solemnly
it
the
thundher
it
shrivels
me
up
that
what
it
does
the
thundher
is
it
sure
that
only
the
bluff
the
storm
puts
up
when
the
rale
harm
is
done
by
the
lightnin
flash
there
is
no
harm
in
the
thundher
at
all
and
remember
after
all
it
the
will
of
god
peg
thought
a
moment
it
always
sounds
just
as
if
he
were
lookin
down
at
us
and
firin
off
cannons
at
us
because
he
angry
with
us
said
nothing
presently
he
felt
her
small
hand
creep
into
his
father
said
peg
are
yez
ralely
ashamed
of
me
when
i
frightened
like
that
was
afraid
to
unbend
lest
he
broke
down
altogether
so
he
continued
in
a
voice
of
mock
severity
i
am
that
when
ye
cry
and
moan
about
what
god
has
been
good
enough
to
send
us
is
it
a
coward
i
am
for
bein
afraid
father
said
peg
her
lips
quivering
that
what
ye
are
peg
replied
with
spartan
severity
then
i
never
be
one
again
father
never
again
and
her
eyes
filled
up
he
suddenly
took
her
in
his
arms
and
pressed
her
to
him
and
rocked
her
as
though
she
were
still
a
baby
and
his
voice
trembled
and
was
full
of
pity
as
he
said
ye
ca
help
it
acushla
ye
ca
help
it
ye
not
a
coward
my
own
brave
little
peg
it
yer
mother
in
ye
she
could
never
bear
a
without
fear
and
she
was
the
bravest
woman
that
ever
lived
bad
luck
to
me
for
sayin
a
cross
word
to
ye
suddenly
poor
little
peg
burst
out
crying
and
buried
her
face
on
her
father
breast
and
sobbed
and
sobbed
as
though
her
heart
would
break
ssh
ssh
there
there
me
darlin
cried
now
thoroughly
alarmed
at
the
depth
of
feeling
the
child
had
loosened
from
her
emotion
ye
must
cry
ye
must
see
it
laughin
i
am
laughin
that
what
i
doin
and
he
laughed
loudly
while
his
heart
ached
and
he
told
her
stories
until
she
forgot
her
tears
and
laughed
too
and
that
night
as
he
watched
her
fall
off
to
sleep
he
knelt
down
in
the
straw
and
prayed
oh
kape
her
always
like
she
is
now
always
just
a
sweet
innocent
pure
little
creature
kape
the
mother
in
her
always
dear
lord
so
that
she
may
grow
in
your
likeness
and
join
my
poor
dear
angela
in
the
end
amen
those
were
indeed
glorious
days
for
peg
she
never
forgot
them
in
after
life
waking
in
the
freshness
of
the
early
morning
making
their
frugal
breakfast
feeding
the
faithful
old
horse
and
then
starting
off
through
the
emerald
green
for
another
new
and
wonderful
day
to
spread
the
light
of
the
cause
had
changed
very
much
since
the
days
of
kernan
hill
as
was
foreshadowed
earlier
he
no
longer
urged
violence
he
had
come
under
the
influence
of
the
more
temperate
men
of
the
party
and
was
content
to
win
by
legislative
means
what
ireland
had
failed
to
accomplish
wholly
by
conflict
although
no
one
recognised
more
thoroughly
than
what
a
large
part
the
determined
attitude
of
the
irish
party
in
resisting
the
english
laws
depriving
them
of
the
right
of
free
speech
and
of
meeting
to
spread
light
amongst
the
ignorant
had
played
in
wringing
some
measure
of
recognition
and
of
tolerance
from
the
bitter
narrowness
of
the
english
ministers
what
changed
more
particularly
was
the
action
of
a
band
of
patriots
who
operated
in
many
parts
of
ireland
maiming
cattle
ruining
crops
injuring
peaceable
farmers
who
did
not
do
their
bidding
and
shooting
at
landlords
and
prominent
people
connected
with
the
government
crime
is
not
a
means
to
honourable
victory
and
was
ashamed
of
the
miscreants
who
blackened
the
fair
name
of
his
country
by
their
ruthless
and
despicable
methods
he
avoided
the
possibility
of
imprisonment
again
for
the
sake
of
peg
what
would
befall
her
if
he
were
taken
from
her
the
continual
thought
that
preyed
upon
him
was
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
leave
her
when
his
call
came
do
what
he
would
he
could
make
but
little
money
and
when
he
had
a
small
surplus
he
would
spend
it
on
peg
a
shawl
to
keep
her
warm
or
a
ribbon
to
give
a
gleam
of
colour
to
the
drab
little
clothes
on
great
occasions
he
would
buy
her
a
new
dress
and
then
peg
was
the
proudest
little
child
in
the
whole
of
ireland
every
year
on
the
anniversary
of
her
mother
death
had
a
mass
said
for
the
repose
of
angela
soul
and
he
would
kneel
beside
peg
through
the
service
and
be
silent
for
the
rest
of
the
day
one
year
he
had
candles
blessed
by
the
archbishop
lit
on
our
lady
altar
and
he
stayed
long
after
the
service
was
over
he
sent
peg
home
but
although
peg
obeyed
him
partially
by
leaving
the
church
she
kept
watch
outside
until
her
father
came
out
he
was
wiping
his
eyes
as
he
saw
her
he
pretended
to
be
very
angry
did
i
tell
ye
to
go
home
ye
did
father
then
why
did
ye
obey
me
sure
an
what
would
i
be
doin
at
home
all
alone
without
you
be
cross
with
me
father
he
took
her
hand
and
they
walked
home
in
silence
he
had
been
crying
and
peg
could
not
understand
it
she
had
never
seen
him
do
such
a
thing
before
and
it
worried
her
it
did
not
seem
right
that
a
man
should
cry
it
seemed
a
weakness
and
that
her
father
of
all
men
should
do
it
he
who
was
not
afraid
of
anything
nor
anyone
it
was
wholly
unaccountable
to
her
when
they
reached
home
peg
busied
herself
about
her
father
trying
to
make
him
comfortable
furtively
watching
him
all
the
while
when
she
had
put
him
in
an
easy
chair
and
brought
him
his
slippers
and
built
up
the
fire
she
sat
down
on
a
little
stool
by
his
side
after
a
long
silence
she
stroked
the
back
of
his
hand
and
then
gave
him
a
little
tug
he
looked
down
at
her
what
is
it
peg
was
my
mother
very
beautiful
father
the
most
beautiful
woman
that
ever
lived
in
all
the
wurrld
peg
she
looks
beautiful
in
the
picture
ye
have
of
her
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
he
drew
out
a
little
miniature
the
frame
had
long
since
been
worn
and
frayed
looked
at
the
face
and
his
eyes
shone
the
man
that
painted
it
could
put
the
soul
of
her
into
it
that
he
could
not
the
soul
of
her
am
i
like
her
at
all
father
asked
peg
wistfully
sometimes
ye
are
dear
very
like
after
a
little
pause
peg
said
ye
loved
her
very
much
father
did
ye
he
nodded
i
loved
her
with
all
the
heart
of
me
and
all
the
strength
of
me
peg
sat
quiet
for
some
minutes
then
she
asked
him
a
question
very
quietly
and
hung
in
suspense
on
his
answer
do
ye
love
me
as
much
as
ye
loved
her
father
it
different
peg
quite
quite
different
why
is
it
she
waited
he
did
not
answer
sure
love
is
love
whether
ye
feel
it
for
a
woman
or
a
child
she
persisted
remained
silent
did
ye
love
her
betther
than
ye
love
me
father
her
soul
was
in
her
great
blue
eyes
as
she
waited
excitedly
for
the
answer
to
that
to
her
momentous
question
why
do
ye
ask
me
that
said
because
i
always
feel
a
little
sharp
pain
right
through
my
heart
whenever
ye
talk
about
me
mother
ye
see
father
i
thought
all
these
years
that
i
was
the
one
ye
really
loved
ye
the
only
one
i
have
in
the
wurrld
peg
and
ye
do
love
her
memory
betther
than
ye
do
me
put
both
of
his
arms
around
her
yer
mother
is
with
the
saints
peg
and
here
are
you
by
me
side
sure
there
room
in
me
heart
for
the
memory
of
her
and
the
love
of
you
she
breathed
a
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
nestled
onto
her
father
shoulder
the
little
fit
of
childish
jealousy
of
her
dead
mother
place
in
her
father
heart
passed
she
wanted
no
one
to
share
her
father
affection
with
her
she
gave
him
all
of
hers
she
needed
all
of
his
when
peg
was
eighteen
years
old
and
they
were
living
in
dublin
was
offered
quite
a
good
position
in
new
york
it
appealed
to
him
the
additional
money
would
make
things
easier
for
peg
she
was
almost
a
woman
now
and
he
wanted
her
to
get
the
finishing
touches
of
education
that
would
prepare
her
for
a
position
in
the
world
if
she
met
the
man
she
felt
she
could
marry
whenever
he
would
speak
of
marriage
peg
would
laugh
scornfully
who
would
i
be
of
afther
marryin
i
like
to
know
where
in
the
wurrld
would
i
find
a
man
like
you
and
no
coaxing
would
make
her
carry
on
the
discussion
or
consider
its
possibility
it
still
harassed
him
to
think
he
had
so
little
to
leave
her
if
anything
happened
to
him
the
offer
to
go
to
america
seemed
providential
her
mother
was
buried
there
he
would
take
peg
to
her
grave
peg
grew
very
thoughtful
at
the
idea
of
leaving
ireland
all
her
little
likes
and
dislikes
her
impulsive
affections
and
hot
hatreds
were
all
bound
up
in
that
country
she
dreaded
the
prospect
of
meeting
a
number
of
new
people
still
it
was
for
her
father
good
so
she
turned
a
brave
face
to
it
and
said
sure
it
is
the
finest
thing
in
the
wurrld
for
both
of
us
but
the
night
before
they
left
ireland
she
sat
by
the
little
window
in
her
until
daylight
looking
back
through
all
the
years
of
her
short
life
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
cutting
off
all
that
beautiful
golden
period
she
would
never
again
know
the
free
careless
existence
that
she
had
loved
so
much
it
was
a
pale
wistful
tired
little
peg
that
joined
her
father
at
breakfast
next
morning
his
heart
was
heavy
too
but
he
laughed
and
joked
and
sang
and
said
how
glad
they
ought
to
be
going
to
that
wonderful
new
country
and
by
the
way
the
country
peg
was
born
in
too
and
then
he
laughed
again
and
said
how
fine
she
looked
and
how
well
he
felt
and
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
god
hand
in
it
all
and
peg
pretended
to
cheer
up
and
they
acted
their
parts
right
to
the
end
until
the
last
line
of
land
disappeared
and
they
were
headed
for
america
then
they
separated
and
went
to
their
little
cabins
to
think
of
all
that
had
been
and
every
day
they
kept
up
the
little
deception
with
each
other
until
they
reached
america
they
were
cheerless
days
at
first
for
everything
reminded
him
of
his
first
landing
twenty
years
before
with
his
young
wife
both
so
full
of
hope
with
the
future
stretching
out
like
some
wonderful
panorama
before
them
he
returns
twenty
years
older
to
begin
the
fight
again
this
time
for
his
daughter
his
wife
was
buried
at
a
little
catholic
cemetery
a
few
miles
outside
new
york
city
there
he
took
peg
one
day
and
they
put
flowers
on
the
little
mound
of
earth
and
knelt
awhile
in
prayer
beneath
that
earth
lay
not
only
his
wife
remains
but
early
hopes
and
ambitions
were
buried
with
her
neither
spoke
either
going
to
or
returning
from
the
cemetery
heart
was
too
full
peg
knew
what
was
passing
through
his
mind
and
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
silent
but
her
little
brain
was
busy
thinking
back
peg
had
much
to
think
of
during
the
early
days
following
her
arrival
in
new
york
at
first
the
city
awed
her
with
its
huge
buildings
and
ceaseless
whirl
of
activity
and
noise
she
longed
to
be
back
in
her
own
little
green
beautiful
country
was
away
during
those
first
days
until
late
apt
night
he
found
a
school
for
peg
she
did
not
want
to
go
to
it
but
just
to
please
her
father
she
agreed
she
lasted
in
it
just
one
week
they
laughed
at
her
brogue
and
teased
and
tormented
her
for
her
absolute
lack
of
knowledge
peg
put
up
with
that
just
as
long
as
she
could
then
one
day
she
opened
out
on
them
and
astonished
them
they
could
not
have
been
more
amazed
had
a
bomb
exploded
in
their
midst
the
little
girl
was
a
veritable
virago
she
attacked
and
belittled
and
mimicked
and
berated
them
they
had
talked
of
her
brogue
they
should
listen
to
their
own
nasal
utterances
that
sounded
as
if
they
were
speaking
with
their
noses
and
not
with
their
tongues
even
the
teacher
did
not
go
unscathed
she
came
in
for
an
onslaught
too
that
closed
peg
career
as
a
new
york
student
her
father
arranged
his
work
so
that
he
could
be
with
her
at
certain
periods
of
the
day
and
outlined
her
studies
from
his
own
slender
stock
of
knowledge
he
even
hired
a
little
piano
for
her
and
followed
up
what
he
had
begun
years
before
in
ireland
imbuing
her
with
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
moore
and
his
delightful
melodies
one
wonderful
day
they
had
an
addition
to
their
small
family
a
little
scrubby
melancholy
irish
terrier
followed
for
miles
he
tried
to
drive
him
away
the
dog
would
turn
and
run
for
a
few
seconds
and
the
moment
would
take
his
eyes
off
him
he
would
run
along
and
catch
him
up
and
wag
his
tail
and
look
up
at
with
his
sad
eyes
the
dog
followed
him
all
the
way
home
and
when
opened
the
door
he
ran
in
had
not
the
heart
to
turn
him
out
so
he
poured
out
some
milk
and
broke
up
some
dry
biscuits
for
him
and
then
played
with
him
until
peg
came
home
she
liked
the
little
dog
at
once
and
then
and
there
adopted
him
and
gave
him
to
peg
he
said
the
dog
face
had
a
look
of
michael
quinlan
the
fenian
so
michael
he
was
named
and
he
took
his
place
in
the
little
home
he
became
peg
boon
companion
they
romped
together
like
children
and
they
talked
to
each
other
and
understood
each
other
michael
had
an
eloquent
tail
an
expressive
bark
and
a
pair
of
eyes
that
told
more
than
speech
the
days
flowed
quietly
on
apparently
satisfied
with
his
lot
but
to
peg
sharp
eye
all
was
not
well
with
him
there
was
a
settled
melancholy
about
him
whenever
she
surprised
him
thinking
alone
she
thought
he
was
fretting
for
ireland
and
their
happy
days
together
and
so
said
nothing
he
was
really
worrying
over
peg
future
he
had
such
a
small
amount
of
money
put
by
and
working
on
a
salary
it
would
be
long
before
he
could
save
enough
to
leave
peg
sufficient
to
carry
her
on
for
a
while
if
anything
happened
there
was
always
that
if
anything
happened
running
in
his
mind
one
day
the
chance
of
solving
the
whole
difficulty
of
peg
future
was
placed
in
his
hands
but
the
means
were
so
distasteful
to
him
that
he
hesitated
about
even
telling
her
he
came
in
unexpectedly
in
the
early
afternoon
of
that
day
and
found
a
letter
waiting
for
him
with
an
english
postmark
peg
had
eyed
it
curiously
off
and
on
for
hours
she
had
turned
it
over
and
over
in
her
fingers
and
looked
at
the
curious
angular
writing
and
felt
a
little
cold
shiver
run
up
and
down
her
as
she
found
herself
wondering
who
could
be
writing
to
her
father
from
england
when
walked
in
and
picked
the
letter
up
she
watched
him
excitedly
she
felt
for
some
strange
reason
that
they
were
going
to
reach
a
crisis
in
their
lives
when
the
seal
was
broken
and
the
contents
disclosed
superstition
was
strong
in
peg
and
all
that
day
she
had
been
nervous
without
reason
and
excited
without
cause
read
the
letter
through
twice
slowly
the
first
time
quickly
the
second
a
look
of
bewilderment
came
across
his
face
as
he
sat
down
and
stared
at
the
letter
in
his
hand
who
is
it
from
at
all
asked
peg
very
quietly
though
she
was
trembling
all
through
her
body
her
father
said
nothing
presently
he
read
it
through
again
it
from
england
father
is
it
queried
peg
pale
as
a
ghost
yes
peg
answered
her
father
and
his
voice
sounded
hollow
and
spiritless
i
did
know
ye
had
friends
in
england
said
peg
eyeing
the
letter
i
have
replied
her
father
then
who
is
it
from
insisted
peg
now
all
impatience
and
with
a
strange
fear
tugging
at
her
heart
looked
up
at
her
as
she
stood
there
staring
down
at
him
her
big
eyes
wide
open
and
her
lips
parted
he
took
both
of
her
hands
in
one
of
his
and
held
them
all
crushed
together
for
what
seemed
to
peg
to
be
a
long
long
while
she
hardly
breathed
she
knew
something
was
going
to
happen
to
them
both
at
last
spoke
and
his
voice
trembled
and
broke
peg
do
ye
remember
one
mornin
years
and
years
ago
when
i
was
to
speak
in
county

cart
at

we
thravelled

big
crossing
where

roads

big
again

she
bent
down
and
straightened
the
furrows
in
his
forehead
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
kissed
him
and
then
whistled
to
the
wistful
michael
and
together
they
went
running
down
the
street
toward
the
little
patch
of
green
where
the
children
played
and
amongst
whom
michael
was
a
prime
favourite
sitting
his
head
in
his
hands
his
eyes
staring
into
the
past
was
facing
the
second
great
tragedy
of
his
life
chapter
ii
we
meet
an
old
friend
after
many
years
while
sat
there
in
that
little
room
in
new
york
trying
to
decide
peg
fate
a
man
who
had
played
some
considerable
part
in
life
lay
in
a
splendidly
furnished
room
in
a
mansion
in
the
west
end
of
london
dying
nathaniel
kingsnorth
twenty
years
of
loneliness
and
desolation
were
coming
to
an
end
what
an
empty
arid
stretch
of
time
those
years
seemed
to
him
as
he
feebly
looked
back
on
them
after
the
tragedy
of
his
sister
reckless
marriage
he
deserted
public
life
entirely
and
shut
himself
away
in
his
except
for
a
few
weeks
in
london
occasionally
when
his
presence
was
required
on
one
or
other
of
the
boards
of
which
he
was
a
director
the
irish
estate
which
brought
about
all
his
misfortunes
he
disposed
of
at
a
ridiculously
low
figure
he
said
he
would
accept
any
bid
however
small
so
that
he
could
sever
all
connection
with
the
hated
village
from
the
day
of
angela
elopement
he
neither
saw
nor
wrote
to
any
member
of
his
family
his
other
sister
chichester
wrote
to
him
from
time
to
time
telling
him
one
time
of
the
birth
of
a
boy
two
years
later
of
the
advent
of
a
girl
kingsnorth
did
not
answer
any
of
her
letters
in
no
way
dismayed
chichester
continued
to
write
periodically
she
wrote
him
when
her
son
alaric
went
to
school
and
also
when
he
went
to
college
alaric
seemed
to
absorb
most
of
her
interest
he
was
evidently
her
favourite
child
she
wrote
more
seldom
of
her
daughter
ethel
and
when
she
did
happen
to
refer
to
her
she
dwelt
principally
on
her
beauty
and
her
accomplishments
five
years
before
an
envelope
in
deep
mourning
came
to
kingsnorth
and
on
opening
it
he
found
a
letter
from
his
sister
acquainting
him
with
the
melancholy
news
that
chichester
had
ended
a
life
of
usefulness
at
the
english
bar
and
had
died
leaving
the
family
quite
comfortably
off
kingsnorth
telegraphed
his
condolences
and
left
instructions
for
a
suitable
wreath
to
be
sent
to
the
funeral
but
he
did
not
attend
it
nor
did
he
at
any
time
express
the
slightest
wish
to
see
his
sister
nor
did
he
encourage
any
suggestion
on
her
part
to
visit
him
when
he
was
stricken
with
an
illness
from
which
no
hope
of
recovery
was
held
out
to
him
he
at
once
began
to
put
his
affairs
in
order
and
his
lawyer
spent
days
with
him
drawing
up
statements
of
his
last
wishes
for
the
disposition
of
his
fortune
with
death
stretching
out
its
hand
to
snatch
him
from
a
life
he
had
enjoyed
so
little
his
thoughts
coloured
with
the
fancies
of
a
tired
sick
brain
kept
turning
constantly
to
his
dead
sister
angela
from
time
to
time
down
through
the
years
he
had
a
softened
gentle
remembrance
of
her
when
the
news
of
her
death
came
furious
and
unrelenting
as
he
had
been
toward
her
her
passing
softened
it
had
he
known
in
time
he
would
have
insisted
on
her
burial
in
the
kingsnorth
vault
but
she
had
already
been
interred
in
new
york
before
the
news
of
her
death
reached
him
the
one
bitter
hatred
of
his
life
had
been
against
the
man
who
had
taken
his
sister
in
marriage
and
in
so
doing
had
killed
all
possibility
of
kingsnorth
succeeding
in
his
political
and
social
aspirations
he
heard
vaguely
of
a
daughter
he
took
no
interest
in
the
news
now
however
the
remembrance
of
his
treatment
of
angela
burnt
into
him
he
especially
repented
of
that
merciless
cable
you
have
made
your
bed
lie
in
it
it
haunted
him
through
the
long
hours
of
his
slow
and
painful
illness
had
he
helped
her
she
might
have
been
alive
and
those
bitter
reflections
that
ate
into
him
night
and
day
might
have
been
replaced
by
gentler
ones
and
so
make
his
end
the
more
peaceful
he
thought
of
angela
child
and
wondered
if
she
were
like
his
poor
dead
sister
the
wish
to
see
the
child
became
an
obsession
with
him
one
morning
after
a
restless
feverish
night
he
sent
for
his
lawyer
and
told
him
to
at
once
institute
inquiries
find
out
if
the
child
was
still
living
and
if
so
where
this
his
lawyer
did
he
located
in
new
york
through
a
friend
of
his
in
the
irish
party
and
found
that
the
child
was
living
with
him
in
rather
poor
circumstances
he
communicated
the
result
of
his
inquiries
to
kingsnorth
that
day
a
letter
was
sent
to
asking
him
to
allow
his
child
to
visit
her
dying
uncle
was
to
cable
at
kingsnorth
expense
and
if
he
would
consent
the
money
for
the
expenses
of
the
journey
would
be
cabled
immediately
the
girl
was
to
start
at
once
as
kingsnorth
had
very
little
longer
to
live
when
the
letter
had
gone
kingsnorth
drew
a
breath
of
relief
he
longed
to
see
the
child
he
would
have
to
wait
impatiently
for
the
reply
perhaps
the
man
whom
he
had
hated
all
his
life
would
refuse
his
request
if
he
did
well
he
would
make
some
provision
in
his
will
for
her
in
memory
of
his
dead
sister
the
next
day
he
altered
his
entire
will
and
made
margaret
a
special
legacy
ten
days
late
a
cable
came
i
consent
to
my
daughter
visiting
you
frank
owen
the
lawyer
cabled
at
once
making
all
arrangements
through
their
bankers
in
new
york
for
miss
journey
that
night
kingsnorth
slept
without
being
disturbed
he
awoke
refreshed
in
the
morning
it
was
the
first
kindly
action
he
had
done
for

peg
leaves
her
father
for
the
first
time
had
a
hard
struggle
with
peg
before
she
would
consent
to
leave
him
she
met
all
his
arguments
with
nothing
would
move
her
for
hours
why
should
i
go
to
a
man
i
have
never
seen
and
hate
the
name
of
he
your
uncle
peg
it
a
fine
uncle
he
been
to
me
all
me
life
and
it
was
a
grand
way
he
threated
me
mother
when
she
was
starvin
he
wants
to
do
somethin
for
ye
now
peg

to

now
listen

little
i
have
to
lave

when

pleaded
i
not
listen
to
any
talk
at
all
about
yer
goin
yer
a
great
strong
healthy
man
that
what
ye
are
what
are
ye
talkin
about
what
got
into
yer
head
about
goin
the
time
must
come
some
day
peg
all
right
we
know
how
to
face
it
when
it
does
but
we
not
out
all
the
way
to
meet
it
said
peg
resolutely
it
very
few
advantages
i
been
able
to
give
ye
me
darlin
and
took
up
the
argument
again
advantages
or
no
advantages
what
can
anybody
be
more
than
be
happy
answer
me
that
an
sure
it
happy
i
been
with
you
now
why
should
ye
want
to
dhrive
it
all
away
from
me
to
these
unanswerable
reasons
would
remain
silent
for
a
while
only
to
take
up
the
cudgels
again
he
realised
what
it
would
mean
to
peg
to
go
to
london
to
have
the
value
of
education
and
of
gentle
surroundings
he
knew
her
heart
was
loyal
to
him
nothing
strangers
might
teach
her
would
ever
alter
that
and
he
felt
he
owed
it
to
her
to
give
her
this
chance
of
seeing
the
great
world
he
would
never
be
able
to
do
it
for
her
much
as
he
hated
the
name
of
kingsnorth
he
acknowledged
the
fact
that
he
had
made
an
offer
had
no
real
right
to
refuse
he
finally
persuaded
peg
that
it
was
the
wise
thing
the
right
thing
and
the
thing
he
wished
for
the
most
i
do
care
whether
it
wise
or
right
said
poor
peg
beaten
at
last
but
if
you
wish
it
and
she
broke
off
i
do
wish
it
peg
ye
turn
me
away
from
ye
eh
no
peg
ye
come
back
to
me
a
fine
lady
i
like
to
see
anybody
thry
that
with
me
a
lady
indeed
ye
love
me
as
i
am
i
do
want
to
be
any
different
but
ye
go
if
ye
say
so
then
it
all
settled
i
suppose
it
is
good
me
darlin
ye
never
regret
it
said
this
with
a
cheery
laugh
though
his
heart
was
aching
at
the
thought
of
being
separated
from
her
peg
looked
at
him
reproachfully
then
she
said
it
surprised
i
am
at
ye
turnin
me
away
from
ye
to
go
into
a
old
man
house
that
threated
me
mother
the
way
he
did
and
so
the
discussion
ended
for
the
next
few
days
peg
was
busy
preparing
herself
for
the
journey
and
buying
little
things
for
her
scanty
equipment
then
the
cable
came
to
the
effect
that
a
passage
was
reserved
for
her
and
money
was
waiting
at
a
banker
for
her
expenses
this
peg
obstinately
refused
to
touch
she
did
want
anything
except
what
her
father
gave
her
when
the
morning
of
her
departure
came
poor
peg
woke
with
a
heavy
heart
it
was
their
first
parting
and
she
was
miserable
on
the
contrary
seemed
full
of
life
and
high
spirits
he
laughed
at
her
and
joked
with
her
and
made
a
little
bundle
of
some
things
that
would
not
go
in
her
bag
and
that
he
had
kept
for
her
to
the
last
minute
they
were
a
rosary
that
had
been
his
mother
a
father
cahill
gave
him
the
day
he
was
confirmed
and
lastly
the
little
miniature
of
angela
it
wrung
his
heart
to
part
with
it
but
he
wanted
peg
to
have
it
near
her
especially
as
she
was
going
amongst
the
relations
of
the
dead
woman
all
through
this
showed
not
a
trace
of
emotion
before
peg
he
kept
telling
her
there
was
nothing
to
be
sad
about
it
was
all
going
to
be
for
her
good
when
the
time
came
to
go
the
strange
pair
made
their
way
down
to
the
ship
the
tall
erect
man
and
the
little
girl
in
her
simple
black
suit
and
her
little
black
hat
with
red
flowers
to
brighten
it
went
aboard
with
her
and
an
odd
couple
they
looked
on
the
with
peg
holding
on
to
michael
much
to
the
amusement
of
the
passengers
the
visitors
and
the
stewards
poor
staunch
loyal
honest
true
little
peg
going
alone
to
what
leaving
the
one
human
being
she
cared
for
and
worshipped
her
playmate
counsellor
friend
and
father
all
in
one
never
dropped
his
high
spirits
all
the
time
they
were
together
on
board
the
ship
he
went
aboard
with
a
laugh
and
when
the
bell
rang
for
all
visitors
to
go
ashore
he
said
to
peg
with
a
laugh
while
poor
peg
heart
felt
like
a
stone
in
her
breast
she
stood
sobbing
up
against
the
rail
of
the
saloon
deck
as
the
ship
swung
clear
she
was
looking
for
her
father
through
the
mists
of
tears
that
blinded
her
just
as
the
boat
slowly
swept
past
the
end
of
the
dock
she
saw
him
right
at
the
last
post
so
that
he
could
watch
the
boat
uninterruptedly
until
it
was
out
of
sight
he
was
crying
himself
now
crying
like
a
child
and
as
the
boat
swung
away
he
called
up
my
little
peg
peg
my
heart
how
she
longed
to
get
off
that
ship
and
go
back
to
him
they
stood
waving
to
each
other
as
long
as
they
remained
in
sight
while
the
ship
ploughed
her
way
toward
england
with
little
peg
on
board
the
man
whom
she
was
crossing
the
atlantic
to
meet
died
quietly
one
morning
with
no
one
near
him
the
nurse
found
kingsnorth
smiling
peacefully
as
though
asleep
he
had
been
dead
several
hours
near
him
on
the
table
was
a
cable
despatch
from
new
york
my
daughter
sailed
on
the
mauretania
at
ten
frank
owen
book
iv
peg
in
england
chapter
i
the
chichester
family
chichester
whom
we
last
saw
under
extremely
distressing
circumstances
in
ireland
now
enters
prominently
into
the
story
she
was
leading
a
secluded
and
charming
existence
in
an
old
and
picturesque
villa
at
scarboro
in
the
north
of
england
although
her
husband
had
been
dead
for
several
years
she
still
clung
to
the
outward
symbols
of
mourning
it
added
a
softness
to
the
patrician
line
of
her
features
and
a
touch
of
distinction
to
her
manner
and
poise
she
had
an
illustrious
example
of
a
sorrow
and
being
ever
loyal
chichester
retained
the
weeds
of
widowhood
and
the
crepe
of
affliction
ever
present
she
was
proud
indeed
of
her
two
children
about
whom
she
had
written
so
glowingly
to
her
brother
nathaniel
alaric
was
the
elder
in
him
chichester
took
the
greater
pride
he
was
so
nearly
being
great
even
from
infancy
that
he
continually
kept
his
mother
in
a
condition
of
expectant
wonder
he
was
nearly
brilliant
at
school
at
college
he
almost
got
his
degree
he
just
missed
his
blue
at
cricket
and
but
for
an
unfortunate
ball
dribbling
over
the
net
at
a
critical
moment
in
the
of
the
tennis
championships
he
might
have
won
the
cup
he
was
quite
philosophic
about
it
though
and
never
appeared
to
reproach
fate
for
treating
him
so
shabbily
he
was
always
nearly
doing
something
and
kept
chichester
in
a
lively
condition
of
trusting
hope
and
occasional
disappointment
she
knew
he
would
arrive
some
day
come
into
his
own
then
all
these
efforts
would
be
invaluable
in
the
building
of
his
character
her
daughter
ethel
on
the
other
hand
was
the
exact
antithesis
to
alaric
she
had
never
shown
the
slightest
interest
in
anything
since
she
had
first
looked
up
at
the
man
of
medicine
who
ushered
her
into
the
world
she
regarded
everything
about
her
with
the
greatest
complacency
she
was
never
surprised
or
angry
or
pleased
or
depressed
sorrow
never
seemed
to
affect
her
nor
joy
make
her
smile
she
looked
on
life
as
a
gentle
brook
down
whose
current
she
was
perfectly
content
to
drift
undisturbed
at
least
that
was
the
effect
created
in
mind
she
never
thought
it
possible
there
might
be
latent
possibilities
in
her
impassive
daughter
while
her
mother
admired
ethel
lofty
attitude
of
indifference
toward
the
world
a
manner
that
bespoke
the
aristocrat
she
secretly
chafed
at
her
daughter
lack
of
enthusiasm
how
different
to
alaric
always
full
of
nearly
new
ideas
always
about
to
do
something
alaric
kept
those
around
him
on
the
alert
no
one
ever
really
knew
what
he
would
do
next
on
the
other
hand
ethel
depressed
by
her
stolid
content
with
everything
about
her
every
one
knew
what
she
would
do
or
thought
they
did
chichester
had
long
since
abandoned
any
further
attempt
to
interest
her
brother
nathaniel
in
the
children
angela
wretched
marriage
had
upset
everything
driven
nathaniel
to
be
a
recluse
and
to
close
his
doors
on
near
and
distant
relatives
angela
death
the
following
year
did
not
relieve
the
situation
if
anything
it
intensified
it
since
she
left
a
baby
that
naturally
none
of
the
family
could
possibly
take
the
slightest
notice
of
nor
interest
in
it
was
tacitly
agreed
never
to
speak
of
the
unfortunate
incident
especially
before
the
children
it
was
such
a
terrible
example
for
ethel
and
so
discouraging
to
the
eager
and
ambitious
alaric
consequently
angela
name
was
never
spoken
inside
of
regal
villa
and
so
the
chichester
family
pursued
an
even
course
only
varied
by
alaric
sudden
and
definite
decisions
to
enter
either
public
life
or
athletics
or
the
army
or
the
world
of
art
it
was
really
extremely
hard
for
so
a
young
man
to
decide
to
limit
himself
to
any
one
particular
pursuit
consequently
he
put
off
the
final
choice
from
day
to
day
suddenly
a
most
untoward
incident
happened
alaric
returning
from
a
long
walk
alone
during
which
he
had
almost
decided
to
become
a
doctor
walked
in
through
the
windows
from
the
garden
into
the
and
found
his
mother
in
tears
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
this
was
most
unusual
chichester
was
not
wont
to
give
vent
to
open
emotion
it
shows
a
lack
of
breeding
so
she
always
suppressed
it
it
seemed
to
grow
inwards
to
find
her
weeping
and
almost
audibly
impressed
alaric
that
something
of
more
than
usual
importance
had
occurred
hello
mater
he
cried
cheerfully
though
his
looks
belied
the
buoyancy
of
his
tone
hullo
what
the
matter
what
up
at
the
same
moment
ethel
came
in
through
the
door
it
was
and
at
precisely
that
time
every
morning
ethel
practised
for
half
an
hour
on
the
piano
not
that
she
had
the
slightest
interest
in
music
but
it
helped
the
morning
so
much
she
would
look
forward
to
it
for
an
hour
before
and
think
of
it
for
an
hour
afterwards
and
then
it
was
it
practically
filled
out
the
entire
morning
chichester
looked
up
as
her
beloved
children
came
toward
her
and
real
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
a
real
note
of
alarm
was
in
her
voice
oh
ethel
oh
alaric
alaric
was
at
her
side
in
a
moment
he
was
genuinely
alarmed
ethel
moved
slowly
across
thinking
vaguely
that
something
must
have
disagreed
with
her
mother
what
is
it
mater
cried
alaric
mother
said
ethel
with
as
nearly
a
tone
of
emotion
as
she
could
feel
we
ruined
sobbed
chichester
nonsense
said
the
bewildered
son
really
asked
the
placid
daughter
our
bank
has
failed
every
penny
your
poor
father
left
me
was
in
it
wailed
chichester
we
nothing
nothing
we
beggars
a
horrible
fear
for
a
moment
gripped
alaric
the
dread
of
poverty
he
shivered
suppose
such
a
thing
should
really
happen
then
he
dismissed
it
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
how
perfectly
absurd
poverty
indeed
the
chichesters
beggars
such
nonsense
he
turned
to
his
mother
and
found
her
holding
out
a
letter
and
a
newspaper
he
took
them
both
and
read
them
with
mingled
amazement
and
disgust
first
the
headline
of
the
newspaper
caught
his
eye
failure
of
gifford
bank
then
he
looked
at
the
letter
gifford
bank
suspended
business
yesterday
back
his
eye
travelled
to
the
paper
gifford
bank
has
closed
its
doors
he
was
quite
unable
at
first
to
grasp
the
full
significance
of
the
contents
of
that
letter
and
newspaper
he
turned
to
ethel
eh
he
gasped
pity
she
murmured
trying
to
find
a
particular
piece
of
music
amongst
the
mass
on
the
piano
we
ruined
reiterated
chichester
then
the
real
meaning
of
those
cryptic
headlines
and
the
letter
broke
in
on
alaric
all
the
chichester
blood
was
roused
in
him
now
that
what
i
call
a
downright
rotten
blackguardly
shame
a
blackguardly
shame
his
voice
rose
in
tones
as
it
increased
in
intensity
until
it
almost
reached
a
shriek
something
was
expected
of
him
at
any
rate
indignation
well
he
was
certainly
indignant
closed
its
doors
indeed
he
went
on
why
should
it
close
its
doors
that
what
i
want
to
know
why
should
it
and
he
glared
at
the
unoffending
letter
and
the
newspaper
he
looked
at
ethel
who
was
surreptitiously
concealing
a
yawn
and
was
apparently
quite
undisturbed
by
the
appalling
news
he
found
no
inspiration
there
back
he
went
to
his
mother
for
support
what
right
have
banks
to
fail
there
should
be
a
law
against
it
they
should
be
made
to
open
their
doors
and
keep
open
that
what
we
give
our
money
for
so
that
we
can
take
it
out
again
when
we
want
it
poor
chichester
shook
her
head
sadly
everything
gone
she
moaned
ruined
and
at
my
age
nice
kettle
of
fish
was
all
alaric
could
think
of
he
was
momentarily
stunned
he
turned
once
more
to
ethel
he
never
relied
on
her
very
much
but
at
this
particular
crisis
he
would
like
to
have
some
expression
of
opinion
however
slight
from
her
i
say
ethel
it
a
nice
kettle
of
fish
all
eh
shame
she
said
quietly
as
she
found
the
particular
movement
of
grieg
she
had
been
looking
for
she
loved
grieg
he
fitted
into
all
her
moods
she
played
everything
he
composed
exactly
the
same
she
seemed
to
think
it
soothed
her
she
would
play
some
now
and
soothe
her
mother
and
alaric
she
began
an
impassioned
movement
which
she
played
evenly
and
correctly
and
without
any
unseemly
force
alaric
cried
out
distractedly
for
goodness
sake
stop
that
ethel
have
you
got
any
feelings
ca
you
see
how
upset
the
mater
is
and
i
am

our
backs
into
this
thing
and
thrash
it
all
out
have
a
little
family
meetin
as
it
were
poor
chichester
repeated
as
though
it
were
some
refrain
ruined
at
my
age
alaric
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
and
put
his
arm
around
her
shoulder
and
tried
to
comfort
her
do
you
worry
mater
he
said
do
worry
i
go
down
and
tell
what
i
think
of
exactly

i
think
of
they

the
fool

what

in
there

got
to
have
out
that
all
i
can
say
we
simply
got
to
have
it
out
there
i
said
it
alaric
rose
and
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
five
feet
six
inches
of
manhood
glared
malignantly
at
some
imaginary
bank
officials
his
whole
nature
was
roused
the
future
of
the
family
depended
on
him
they
would
not
depend
in
vain
he
looked
at
ethel
who
was
trying
to
make
the
best
of
the
business
by
smiling
agreeably
on
them
both
it
bankrupt
wailed
chichester
failed
suggested
ethel
cheerfully
we
beggars
continued
the
mother
i
must
live
on
charity
for
the
rest
of
my
life
the
guest
of
relations
i
hated
the
sight
of
and
who
have
hated
me
it
dreadful
dreadful
all
alaric
first
glow
of
manly
enthusiasm
began
to
cool
do
you
think
we
get
anything
by
accident
he
turned
to
ethel
she
smiled
meaninglessly
and
said
for
the
first
time
with
any
real
note
of
conviction
nothing
alaric
sat
down
gloomily
beside
his
mother
i
always
thought
bank
directors
were
blighters
good
lord
what
a
mess
he
looked
the
picture
of
misery
what
to
become
of
ethel
mater
whoever
shelters
me
must
shelter
ethel
as
well
replied
the
mother
sadly
but
it
hard
at
my
age
to
be
sheltered
alaric
looked
at
ethel
and
a
feeling
of
pity
came
over
him
it
was
distinctly
to
his
credit
since
his
own
wrongs
occupied
most
of
his
attention
but
after
all
he
could
buffet
the
world
and
wring
a
living
out
of
it
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
make
up
his
mind
which
walk
in
life
to
choose
he
was
fortunate
but
ethel
reared
from
infancy
in
the
environment
of
independence
it
would
come
very
hard
and
bitter
on
her
alaric
just
touched
ethel
hand
and
with
as
much
feeling
as
he
could
muster
he
said
shockin
tough
old
girl
ethel
shook
her
head
almost
determinedly
and
said
somewhat
enigmatically
and
for
her
heatedly
no
no
asked
alaric
no
what
charity
said
ethel
word
and
alaric
shuddered
what
will
you
do
ethel
work
at
what
teach
teach
who
in
the
wide
world
can
you
teach
children
alaric
laughed
mirthlessly
oh
come
that
rich
eh
mater
fancy
ethel
teachin
grubby
little
brats
their
a
b
c
tush
must
said
ethel
quite
unmoved
a
chichester
teach
said
alaric
in
disgust
settled
from
ethel
and
she
swept
her
finger
slowly
across
the
piano
very
well
said
alaric
determinedly
i
work
too
chichester
looked
up
pleadingly
alaric
went
on
i
put
my
hand
to
the
plough
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
keener
i
am
to
begin
from
i
be
a
workin
man
at
this
ethel
laughed
a
queer
little
odd
supercilious
note
summed
up
in
a
single
word
ha
there
was
nothing
mirthful
in
it
there
was
no
reproach
in
it
it
was
just
an
expression
of
her
honest
feeling
at
the
bare
suggestion
of
her
brother
working
alaric
turned
quickly
to
her
and
may
i
ask
why
that
why
i
ask
you
there
nothing
i
could
do
if
i
were
really
put
to
it
not
a
single
thing
is
there
mater
his
mother
looked
up
proudly
at
him
i
know
that
dear
but
it
dreadful
to
think
of
you
working
not
at
all
said
alaric
i
just
tingling
all
over
at
the
thought
of
it
the
only
reason
i
have
so
far
is
because
i
never
had
to
but
now
that
i
have
i
just
buckle
on
my
armour
so
to
speak
and
astonish
you
all
again
came
that
deadly
cold
unsympathetic
ha
from
ethel
please
do
laugh
in
that
cheerless
way
ethel
it
goes
all
down
my
spine
jerry
always
tellin
me
i
ought
to
do
something
that
the
world
is
for
the
worker
and
all
that
he
right
and
i
goin
to
show
him
he
suddenly
picked
up
the
paper
and
looked
at
the
date
what
the
first
yes
so
it
is
june
the
first
comin
all
his
family
too
they
taken
folly
on
the
hill
he
sure
to
look
in
here
could
be
better
he
the
cove
to
turn
to
in
a
case
like
this
jarvis
a
dignified
butler
who
had
served
the
family
man
and
boy
came
in
at
this
juncture
with
a
visiting
card
on
a
salver
alaric
picked
it
up
and
glanced
at
it
he
gave
an
expression
of
disgust
and
flung
the
card
back
on
the
salver
christian
brent
for
the
first
time
ethel
showed
more
than
a
passing
gleam
of
interest
she
stopped
strumming
the
piano
and
stood
up
very
erect
and
very
still
chichester
rose
too
i
ca
see
any
one
she
said
imperatively
nor
i
added
alaric
i
all
strung
up
he
turned
to
jarvis
tell
brent
we
very
sorry
but
i
see
him
interrupted
ethel
almost
animatedly
bring
brent
here
jarvis
as
jarvis
went
in
search
of
brent
chichester
went
up
the
great
stairs
my
head
is
throbbing
i
go
to
my
room
do
you
worry
mater
consoled
alaric
leave
everything
to
me
i
thrash
the
whole
thing
out
absolutely
thrash
it
out
as
chichester
disappeared
alaric
turned
to
his
calm
sister
who
strangely
enough
was
showing
some
signs
of
life
and
interest
awful
business
ethel
eh
pretty
bad
really
goin
to
teach
yes
right
i
find
somethin
too
very
likely
a
doctor
we
pull
through
somehow
ethel
made
a
motion
toward
the
door
as
though
to
stop
any
further
conversation
brent
coming
she
said
almost
impatiently
alaric
started
for
the
windows
leading
into
the
garden
jolly
good
of
you
to
let
him
bore
you
i
hate
the
sight
of
the
beggar
myself
always
looks
to
me
like
the
first
conspirator
at
a
play
the
door
opened
and
jarvis
entered
and
ushered
in
mr
brent
alaric
hurried
into
the
garden
chapter
ii
christian
brent
a
few
words
of
description
of
christian
brent
might
be
of
interest
since
he
represents
a
type
that
society
always
has
with
it
they
begin
by
deceiving
others
they
end
by
deceiving
themselves
christian
brent
was
a
dark
tense
eager
man
of
years
of
age
his
career
as
a
diplomatist
was
halted
at
its
outset
by
an
early
marriage
with
the
only
daughter
of
a
prosperous
manufacturer
brent
was
moderately
independent
in
his
own
right
but
the
addition
of
his
wife
dowry
seemed
to
destroy
all
ambition
he
no
longer
found
interest
in
carrying
messages
to
the
various
legations
or
embassies
of
europe
or
in
filling
a
routine
position
as
some
secretary
from
being
an
intensely
eager
man
of
affairs
he
drifted
into
a
social
lounger
the
lapdog
of
the
where
the
close
breath
of
some
rare
perfume
meant
more
than
the
clash
of
interests
and
the
conquest
of
a
woman
greater
than
that
of
a
nation
just
at
this
period
ethel
chichester
was
the
especial
object
of
his
adoration
her
beauty
appealed
to
him
her
absolute
indifference
to
him
stung
him
as
a
lash
it
seemed
to
belittle
his
powers
of
attraction
consequently
he
redoubled
his
efforts
ethel
showed
neither
like
nor
dislike
just
a
form
of
toleration
brent
accepted
this
as
a
dog
a
crumb
in
the
hope
of
something
more
substantial
to
follow
he
had
come
that
morning
with
a
fixed
resolve
his
manner
was
determined
his
voice
wooed
as
a
caress
he
went
tenderly
to
ethel
the
moment
the
door
closed
on
jarvis
how
are
you
he
asked
and
there
was
a
note
of
subdued
passion
in
his
tone
fair
replied
ethel
without
even
looking
at
him
where
is
your
mother
suggesting
that
much
depended
on
the
answer
lying
down
answered
ethel
truthfully
and
without
any
feeling
and
alaric
in
the
garden
then
we
have
a
moment
or
two
alone
brent
put
a
world
of
meaning
into
the
suggestion
very
likely
said
ethel
picking
up
a
score
of
boheme
and
looking
at
it
as
if
she
saw
it
for
the
first
time
all
the
while
watching
him
through
her
eyes
brent
went
to
her
glad
to
see
me
he
asked
why
not
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
bent
over
her
more
than
glad
really
he
sat
beside
her
ethel
he
whispered
intensely
i
am
at
the
oh
commented
ethel
without
any
interest
it
came
last
night
did
it
this
is
the
end
between
sybil
and
myself
is
it
yes
the
end
it
been
horrible
from
the
first
horrible
there
not
a
word
of
mine
not
an
action
she
does
misunderstand
how
boring
said
ethel
blandly
she
would
see
harm
even
in
this
why
she
think
i
was
here
to
to
he
stopped
what
innocently
inquired
ethel
make
love
to
you
and
he
looked
earnestly
into
her
eyes
she
met
his
look
quite
frankly
and
astonished
him
with
the
question
well
are
you
he
rose
anxiously
ethel
do
you
always
persisted
ethel
has
it
seemed
like
that
to
you
yes
she
answered
candidly
by
insinuation
never
straightforwardly
has
it
offended
you
then
you
admit
it
oh
he
cried
passionately
i
wish
i
had
the
right
to
to
again
he
wavered
yes
and
ethel
looked
straight
at
him
make
love
to
you
straightforwardly
he
felt
the
supreme
moment
had
almost
arrived
now
he
thought
he
would
be
rewarded
for
the
long
waiting
the
endless
siege
to
this
marvellous
woman
who
concealed
her
real
nature
beneath
that
marble
casing
of
an
assumed
indifference
he
waited
eagerly
for
her
answer
when
it
came
it
shocked
and
revolted
him
ethel
dropped
her
gaze
from
his
face
and
said
with
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
playing
around
her
lips
if
you
had
the
right
to
make
love
to
me
straightforwardly
you
would
do
it
he
looked
at
her
in
amazement
what
do
you
mean
he
gasped
it
only
because
you
have
the
right
that
you
do
it
by
suggestion
ethel
pursued
how
can
you
say
that
and
he
put
all
the
heart
he
was
capable
of
into
the
question
you
do
deny
it
she
said
quietly
he
breathed
hard
and
then
said
bitterly
what
a
contemptible
opinion
you
must
have
of
me
then
we
quits
are
we
how
he
asked
have
you
one
of
me
of
you
why
ethel
surely
every
married
man
must
have
a
contemptible
opinion
of
the
woman
he
covertly
makes
love
to
if
he
had
he
could
do
it
could
he
once
again
she
levelled
her
cold
impassive
eyes
on
brent
flushed
face
i
do
follow
you
was
all
brent
said
have
you
had
time
to
think
of
an
answer
i
do
now
what
you
driving
at
he
added
ethel
smiled
her
most
enigmatical
smile
no
i
think
you
do
she
waited
a
moment
brent
said
nothing
this
was
a
new
mood
of
ethel
it
baffled
him
presently
she
relieved
the
silence
by
asking
him
what
happened
last
night
he
hesitated
then
he
answered
i
rather
not
say
i
sound
like
a
cad
blaming
a
woman
never
mind
how
it
sounds
tell
it
it
must
have
been
amusing
amusing
good
god
he
bent
over
her
again
oh
the
more
i
look
at
you
and
listen
to
you
the
more
i
realise
i
should
never
have
married
why
did
you
came
the
cool
question
brent
answered
with
all
the
power
at
his
command
here
was
the
moment
to
lay
his
heart
bare
that
ethel
might
see
have
you
ever
seen
a
young
hare
fresh
from
its
kind
run
headlong
into
a
snare
have
you
ever
seen
a
young
man
free
of
the
trammels
of
college
dash
into
a
net
did
i
was
he
paced
the
room
restlessly
all
the
rising
in
him
he
went
on
good
god
what
nurslings
we
are
when
we
first
feel
our
feet
like
children
just
loose
from
the
anything
that
glitters
catches
us
every
trap
that
is
set
for
our
unwary
feet
we
drop
into
i
did
dropped
in
caught
hand
and
foot
mind
and
soul
soul
queried
ethel
with
a
note
of
doubt
yes
he
answered
do
you
mean
body
she
suggested
body
mind
and
soul
he
said
with
an
air
of
finality
well
body
anyway
summed
up
ethel
and
for
what
he
went
on
for
what
love
companionship
that
is
what
we
build
on
in
marriage
and
what
did
realise
hate
and
wrangling
wrangling
just
as
the
common
herd
with
no
advantages
wrangle
and
make
it
a
part
of
their
lives
the
zest
to
their
union
it
been
my
curse
why
wrangling
drawled
ethel
she
did
understand
you
asked
ethel
in
surprise
my
thoughts
my
actions
how
curious
you
mean
you
would
probably
i
sure
of
it
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
she
drew
it
away
and
settled
herself
comfortably
to
listen
again
tell
me
more
about
your
wife
the
slightest
attention
shown
to
any
other
woman
meant
a
ridiculous
a
humiliating
scene
humiliating
is
doubt
and
suspicion
humiliating
it
would
be
a
compliment
in
some
cases
how
it
would
put
a
fictitious
value
on
some
men
you
could
humiliate
in
that
way
he
ventured
slowly
no
i
do
think
i
could
if
a
man
showed
a
preference
for
any
other
woman
she
would
be
quite
welcome
to
him
no
man
could
said
brent
insinuatingly
she
looked
at
him
coldly
a
moment
let
me
see
where
were
you
just
married
were
you
go
on
then
came
the
baby
he
said
that
with
a
significant
meaning
and
paused
to
see
the
effect
on
ethel
if
it
had
any
ethel
effectually
concealed
it
her
only
comment
was
ah
brent
went
on
one
would
think
that
would
change
things
but
no
neither
of
us
wanted
her
neither
of
us
love
her
children
should
come
of
love
not
hate
and
she
is
a
child
of
hate
he
paused
looking
intently
at
ethel
she
looked
understandingly
at
him
then
dropped
her
eyes
brent
went
on
as
if
following
up
an
advantage
she
sits
in
her
little
chair
her
small
wrinkled
old
disillusioned
face
turned
to
us
with
the
eyes
watching
us
accusingly
she
submits
to
caresses
as
though
they
were
distasteful
as
if
she
knew
they
were
lies
at
times
she
pushes
the
nearing
face
away
with
her
little
baby
fingers
he
stopped
watching
her
eagerly
her
eyes
were
down
i
should
tell
you
this
it
terrible
i
see
it
in
your
face
what
are
you
thinking
i
sorry
replied
ethel
simply
for
me
for
your
wife
my
wife
he
repeated
aghast
yes
said
ethel
are
you
no
are
you
just
sorry
for
yourself
brent
turned
impatiently
away
so
this
the
wound
in
his
life
was
nothing
to
ethel
instead
of
pity
for
him
all
it
engendered
in
her
was
sorrow
for
his
wife
how
little
women
understood
him
there
was
a
pathetic
catch
in
his
voice
as
he
turned
to
ethel
and
said
reproachfully
you
think
me
purely
selfish
naturally
she
answered
quickly
am
why
not
be
truthful
about
ourselves
sometimes
eh
we
quarrelled
last
night
about
you
he
said
desperately
really
gossip
has
linked
us
together
my
wife
has
heard
and
put
the
worst
construction
on
it
well
we
said
things
to
each
other
last
night
that
can
never
be
forgiven
or
forgotten
i
left
the
house
and
walked
the
streets
hours
i
looked
my
whole
life
back
and
through
as
though
it
were
some
stranger
he
turned
abruptly
away
to
the
windows
and
stayed
a
moment
looking
down
the
drive
ethel
said
nothing
he
came
back
to
her
in
a
few
moments
i
tell
you
we
ought
to
be
taught
we
ought
to
be
taught
when
we
are
young
what
marriage
really
means
just
as
we
are
taught
not
to
steal
nor
lie
nor
sin
in
marriage
we
do
all
three
when
we
we
steal
affection
from
some
one
else
we
lie
in
our
lives
and
we
sin
in
our
relationship
ethel
asked
him
very
quietly
do
you
mean
that
you
are
a
sinner
a
thief
and
a
liar
brent
looked
at
her
in
horror
oh
take
some
of
the
blame
said
ethel
do
put
it
all
on
the
woman
you
never
spoken
to
me
like
this
before
i
often
wanted
to
replied
ethel
then
she
asked
him
what
do
you
intend
doing
separate
he
answered
eagerly
you
do
doctor
a
poisoned
limb
when
your
life
depends
on
it
you
cut
it
off
when
two
lives
generate
a
deadly
poison
face
the
problem
as
a
surgeon
would
amputate
and
after
the
operation
what
then
asked
ethel
that
is
why
i
am
here
facing
you
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
oh
dear
yes
perfectly
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
to
get
to
the
point
ethel
and
he
impulsively
stretched
out
his
arms
as
though
to
embrace
her
she
drew
back
slightly
just
out
of
his
reach
wait
she
looked
up
at
him
quizzically
suppose
we
generate
poison
what
would
you
do
amputate
me
you
are
different
from
all
other
women
did
you
tell
your
wife
that
when
you
asked
her
to
marry
you
he
turned
away
impatiently
do
say
those
things
ethel
they
hurt
i
afraid
christian
i
too
frank
are
i
you
stand
alone
ethel
you
seem
to
look
into
the
hearts
of
people
and
know
why
and
how
they
beat
i
do
sometimes
it
an
awkward
faculty
he
looked
at
her
glowingly
how
marvellously
different
two
women
can
be
you
my
wife
ethel
shook
her
head
and
smiled
her
calm
dead
smile
we
not
really
very
different
christian
only
some
natures
like
change
yours
does
and
the
new
have
all
the
virtues
why
i
might
not
last
as
long
as
your
wife
did
do
say
that
we
lave
a
common
bond
understanding
think
so
i
understand
you
i
wonder
you
do
me
yes
that
is
just
the
difficulty
i
tell
you
i
am
at
the
the
fingerboard
points
the
way
to
me
distinctly
does
it
it
does
he
leaned
across
to
her
would
you
risk
it
what
she
asked
i
hide
nothing
i
put
it
all
before
you
the
snubs
of
your
friends
the
whisper
of
a
scandal
that
would
grow
into
a
roar
afraid
to
open
a
newspaper
fearing
what
might
be
printed
in
it
life
at
first
in
some
little
continental
village
dreading
the
passers
through
keeping
out
of
sight
lest
they
would
recognise
one
no
it
would
be
fair
to
you
ethel
thought
a
moment
then
answered
slowly
no
chris
i
do
think
it
would
you
see
i
am
a
cad
just
a
selfish
cad
are
you
and
she
smiled
up
at
him
i
never
speak
of
this
again
i
would
have
now
only
distracted
completely
distracted
will
you
forgive
me
for
speaking
as
i
did
certainly
said
ethel
i
not
offended
on
the
contrary
anyway
i
think
it
over
and
let
you
know
you
will
really
he
asked
greedily
grasping
at
the
straw
of
a
hope
you
will
really
think
it
over
i
will
really
and
when
she
sets
me
free
he
went
on
we
could
we
could
he
suddenly
stopped
she
looked
coolly
at
him
as
he
hesitated
and
said
it
is
a
difficult
little
word
at
times
is
it
would
you
marry
me
he
asked
with
a
supreme
effort
i
never
cross
my
bridges
until
i
come
to
them
said
ethel
languidly
and
we
such
a
long
way
from
that
one
are
we
then
i
am
to
wait
yes
do
she
replied
when
the
time
comes
to
accept
the
charity
of
relations
or
do
something
useful
for
tuppence
a
week
bohemian
france
or
italy
but
then
the
runaways
always
go
to
france
or
italy
they
suppose
we
say
hungary
shall
we
he
did
not
answer
she
went
on
very
well
when
i
have
to
choose
between
charity
and
labour
bohemian
hungary
may
beckon
me
he
looked
at
her
in
a
puzzled
way
what
new
mood
was
this
charity
he
asked
labour
yes
it
has
come
to
that
a
tiresome
bank
has
failed
with
all
our
sixpences
locked
up
in
it
is
it
stupid
is
all
your
money
gone
i
think
so
good
god
dear
mamma
knows
as
little
about
business
as
she
does
about
me
until
this
morning
she
has
always
had
a
rooted
belief
in
her
bank
and
her
daughter
if
i
bolt
with
you
her
last
cherished
illusion
will
be
destroyed
let
me
help
you
he
said
eagerly
how
and
she
looked
at
him
again
with
that
cold
hard
scrutiny
lend
us
money
do
you
mean
he
fell
into
the
trap
yes
he
said
i
do
that
if
you
let
me
she
gave
just
the
suggestion
of
a
sneer
and
turned
deliberately
away
he
felt
the
force
of
the
unspoken
reproof
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
humbly
she
went
on
as
if
she
had
not
heard
the
offensive
suggestion
so
you
see
we
both
in
a
way
at
the
crossroads
he
seized
her
hand
fiercely
let
me
take
you
away
out
of
it
all
he
cried
she
withdrew
her
hand
slowly
no
she
said
not
just
now
i
not
in
a
bolting
mood
he
moved
away
she
watched
him
then
she
called
him
to
her
something
in
the
man
attracted
this
strange
nature
she
could
not
analyse
or
define
the
attraction
but
the
impelling
force
was
there
he
went
to
her
ethel
spoke
to
him
for
the
first
time
softly
languorously
almost
caressingly
chris
sometime
perhaps
in
the
dead
of
night
something
will
snap
in
me
the
slack
selfish
luxurious
me
that
hates
to
be
roused
into
action
and
the
craving
for
adventure
will
come
then
i
send
for
you
he
took
her
hand
again
and
this
time
she
did
not
draw
it
away
he
said
in
a
whisper
and
you
go
with
me
ethel
stretched
lazily
and
smiled
at
him
through
her
eyes
i
suppose
so
then
heaven
help
you
why
should
we
wait
he
cried
it
will
give
us
the
suspense
of
expectation
i
want
you
i
need
you
he
pleaded
until
the
time
comes
for
amputation
do
do
and
he
dropped
her
hand
suddenly
well
i
do
want
you
to
have
any
illusions
about
me
chris
i
have
none
about
you
let
us
begin
fair
anyway
it
will
be
so
much
easier
when
the
end
comes
there
will
be
no
end
he
said
passionately
i
love
you
love
you
with
every
breath
of
my
body
every
thought
in
my
mind
every
throb
of
my
nerves
i
love
you
he
kissed
her
hand
repeatedly
i
love
you
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
pressed
her
to
him
she
struggled
with
him
without
any
anger
or
disgust
or
fear
as
she
put
him
away
from
her
she
just
said
simply
please
do
it
so
hot
this
morning
as
she
turned
away
from
him
she
was
struck
dumb
sitting
beside
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
back
turned
to
them
was
the
strangest
oddest
little
figure
ethel
had
ever
seen
who
was
she
how
long
had
she
been
in
the
room
ethel
turned
to
brent
he
was
quite
pale
now
and
was
nervously
stroking
his
slight
moustache
ethel
was
furious
it
was
incredible
that
brent
could
have
been
so
indiscreet
how
on
earth
did
that
creature
get
there
without
their
hearing
or
seeing
her
ethel
went
straight
to
the
demure
little
figure
sitting
on
the
chair
chapter
iii
peg
arrives
in
england
peg
journey
to
england
was
one
of
the
unhappiest
memories
of
her
life
she
undertook
the
voyage
deliberately
to
please
her
father
because
he
told
her
it
would
please
him
but
beneath
this
feeling
of
pleasing
him
was
one
of
sullen
resentment
at
being
made
to
separate
from
him
she
planned
all
kinds
of
reprisals
upon
the
unfortunate
people
she
was
going
amongst
she
would
be
so
rude
to
them
and
so
unbearable
that
they
would
be
glad
to
send
her
back
on
the
next
boat
she
schemed
out
her
whole
plan
of
action
she
would
contradict
and
disobey
and
berate
and
belittle
nothing
they
would
do
would
be
right
to
her
and
nothing
she
would
do
or
say
would
be
right
to
them
she
took
infinite
pleasure
in
her
plan
of
campaign
then
when
she
was
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
such
resentful
dreams
she
would
think
of
her
father
waiting
for
news
of
her
of
his
pride
in
her
of
how
much
he
wanted
her
to
succeed
she
would
realise
how
much
the
parting
meant
to
him
and
all
her
little
plots
would
tumble
down
and
she
would
resolve
to
try
and
please
her
relations
learn
all
she
could
succeed
beyond
all
expression
and
either
go
back
to
america
prosperous
or
send
for
her
father
to
join
her
in
england
all
her
dreams
had
her
father
either
centrifugally
or
centripetally
beating
through
them
she
refused
all
advances
of
friendship
aboard
ship
no
one
dared
speak
to
her
she
wanted
to
be
alone
in
her
sorrow
she
and
michael
would
romp
on
the
lower
deck
by
favour
of
one
of
the
seamen
who
would
keep
a
sharp
for
officers
this
seaman
by
name
took
quite
a
liking
to
peg
and
the
dog
and
did
many
little
kindly
gracious
acts
to
minister
to
the
comfort
of
both
of
them
he
warned
her
that
they
would
not
let
michael
go
with
her
from
the
dock
until
he
had
first
been
quarantined
this
hurt
peg
more
than
anything
could
she
burst
into
tears
to
have
michael
taken
from
her
would
be
the
last
misfortune
she
would
indeed
be
alone
in
that
strange
country
she
was
inconsolable
at
last
took
it
on
himself
to
get
the
dog
ashore
he
would
wrap
him
up
in
some
sail
cloths
and
then
he
would
carry
michael
outside
the
gates
when
the
customs
authorities
had
examined
her
few
belongings
when
they
reached
liverpool
was
as
good
as
his
word
though
many
were
the
anxious
moments
they
had
as
one
or
other
of
the
officers
would
eye
the
suspicious
package
carried
so
carelessly
under
his
arm
at
the
dock
a
gentleman
came
on
board
and
after
some
considerable
difficulty
succeeded
in
locating
peg
he
was
a
vigorous
man
of
he
inspired
peg
with
an
instant
dislike
by
his
somewhat
authoritative
and
pompous
manner
he
introduced
himself
as
montgomery
hawkes
the
legal
adviser
for
the
kingsnorth
estate
and
at
once
proceeded
to
take
charge
of
peg
as
a
matter
of
course
poor
peg
felt
ashamed
of
her
poor
little
bag
containing
just
a
few
changes
of
apparel
and
her
little
paper
bundle
she
was
mortified
when
she
walked
down
the
gangway
with
the
lawyer
whilst
extravagantly
dressed
people
with
piles
of
luggage
dashed
here
and
there
endeavouring
to
get
it
examined
but
hawkes
did
not
appear
to
notice
peg
shabbiness
on
the
contrary
he
treated
her
and
her
belongings
as
though
she
were
the
most
fashionable
of
fine
ladies
and
her
wardrobe
the
most
complete
outside
the
gates
she
found
waiting
for
her
with
the
precious
michael
struggling
to
free
himself
from
his
coverings
hawkes
soon
had
a
cab
alongside
he
helped
peg
into
it
then
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
opened
the
and
out
sprang
michael
dusty
and
dirty
and
but
oh
such
a
happy
fussy
affectionate
relieved
little
canine
when
he
saw
his
beloved
owner
waiting
for
him
he
made
one
spring
at
her
much
to
the
dignified
amazement
and
began
to
bark
at
her
and
lick
her
face
and
hands
and
jump
on
and
roll
over
and
over
upon
peg
in
an
excess
of
joy
at
his
release
peg
offered
an
american
dollar
she
had
very
little
left
indignantly
refused
to
take
it
oh
but
ye
must
indade
ye
must
cried
peg
in
distress
sure
i
lie
aisy
if
ye
do
but
for
you
poor
here
might
have
been
on
that
place
ye
spoke
of
that
quarantine
whatever
it
is
ye
saved
him
from
that
and
do
despise
it
because
it
an
american
dollar
sure
it
has
a
value
all
over
the
wurrld
an
besides
i
have
no
english
money
poor
peg
pleaded
that
should
take
it
he
had
been
so
nice
to
her
all
the
way
over
hawkes
interposed
skilfully
gave
five
shillings
thanked
him
warmly
for
his
kindness
to
peg
and
her
dog
returned
the
dollar
to
peg
let
her
say
to
the
kindly
sailor
told
the
cabman
to
drive
to
a
certain
railway
station
and
in
a
few
seconds
they
were
bowling
along
and
peg
had
entered
a
new
country
and
a
new
life
they
reached
the
railway
station
and
hawkes
procured
tickets
and
in
half
an
hour
they
were
on
a
train
bound
for
the
north
of
england
during
the
journey
hawkes
volunteered
no
information
he
bought
her
papers
and
magazines
and
offered
her
lunch
this
peg
refused
she
said
the
ship
had
not
agreed
with
her
she
did
not
think
she
would
want
food
for
a
long
time
to
come
after
a
while
tired
out
with
the
rush
and
excitement
of
the
arrival
peg
fell
asleep
in
a
few
hours
they
reached
their
destination
hawkes
woke
her
and
told
her
she
was
at
her
journey
end
he
again
hailed
a
cab
told
the
driver
where
to
go
and
got
in
with
peg
michael
and
her
luggage
in
the
cab
he
handed
peg
a
card
and
told
her
to
go
to
the
address
written
on
it
and
ask
the
people
there
to
allow
her
to
wait
until
he
joined
her
he
had
a
business
call
to
make
in
the
town
he
would
be
as
short
a
time
as
possible
she
was
just
to
tell
the
people
that
she
had
been
asked
to
call
there
and
wait
after
the
cab
had
gone
through
a
few
streets
it
stopped
before
a
big
building
hawkes
got
out
told
the
cabman
where
to
take
peg
paid
him
and
with
some
final
admonitions
to
peg
disappeared
through
the
of
the
town
hall
the
cabman
took
the
wondering
peg
along
until
he
drove
up
to
a
very
handsome
elizabethan
house
there
he
stopped
peg
looked
at
the
name
on
the
and
then
at
the
name
on
the
card
hawkes
had
given
her
they
were
the
same
once
more
she
gathered
up
her
belongings
and
her
dog
and
passed
in
through
the
gateposts
and
wandered
up
the
long
drive
on
a
tour
of
inspection
she
walked
through
paths
dividing
rosebeds
until
she
came
to
some
open
windows
the
main
of
the
house
seemed
to
be
hidden
away
somewhere
amid
the
tall
old
trees
peg
made
straight
for
the
open
windows
and
walked
into
the
most
wonderful
looking
room
she
had
ever
seen
everything
in
it
was
old
and
massive
it
bespoke
centuries
gone
by
in
every
detail
peg
held
her
breath
as
she
looked
around
her
pictures
and
tapestries
stared
at
her
from
the
walls
beautiful
old
vases
were
arranged
in
cabinets
the
carpet
was
deep
and
soft
and
stifled
all
sound
peg
almost
gave
an
ejaculation
of
surprise
at
the
wonders
of
the
room
when
she
suddenly
became
conscious
that
she
was
not
alone
in
the
room
that
others
were
there
and
that
they
were
talking
she
looked
in
the
direction
the
sounds
came
from
and
saw
to
her
astonishment
a
man
with
a
woman
in
his
arms
he
was
speaking
to
her
in
a
most
ardent
manner
they
were
partially
concealed
by
some
statuary
peg
concluded
at
once
that
she
had
intruded
on
some
marital
scene
at
which
she
was
not
desired
so
she
instantly
sat
down
with
her
back
to
them
she
tried
not
to
listen
but
some
of
the
words
came
distinctly
to
her
just
as
she
was
becoming
very
uncomfortable
and
had
half
made
up
her
mind
to
leave
the
room
and
find
somewhere
else
to
wait
she
suddenly
heard
herself
addressed
and
in
no
uncertain
tone
of
voice
there
was
indignation
surprise
and
anger
in
ethel
question
how
long
have
you
been
here
peg
turned
round
and
saw
a
strikingly
handsome
beautifully
dressed
young
lady
glaring
down
at
her
her
manner
was
haughty
in
the
extreme
peg
felt
most
unhappy
as
she
looked
at
her
and
did
not
answer
immediately
a
little
distance
away
was
a
dark
handsome
young
man
who
was
looking
at
peg
with
a
certain
languid
interest
how
long
have
you
been
here
again
asked
ethel
sure
i
only
came
in
this
minnit
said
peg
innocently
and
with
a
little
note
of
fear
she
was
not
accustomed
to
young
ladies
like
ethel
what
do
you
want
demanded
the
young
lady
nothin
said
peg
reassuringly
nothing
echoed
ethel
growing
angrier
every
moment
not
a
thing
i
was
just
told
to
wait
said
peg
who
told
you
a
gentleman
replied
peg
what
gentleman
asked
ethel
sharply
and
suspiciously
just
a
gentleman
peg
after
fumbling
nervously
in
her
pocket
produced
the
card
hawkes
had
given
her
which
michael
immediately
attempted
to
take
possession
of
peg
snatched
it
away
from
the
dog
and
handed
it
to
the
young
lady
he
told
me
to
wait
there
ethel
took
the
card
irritably
and
read
chichester
regal
villa
and
what
do
you
want
with
mrs
chichester
she
asked
peg
at
the
same
time
looking
at
the
shabby
clothes
the
dog
and
the
soiled
parcel
i
do
want
anythin
with
her
i
was
just
told
to
wait
who
are
you
peg
was
now
getting
angry
too
there
was
no
mistaking
the
manner
of
the
proud
young
lady
peg
chafed
under
it
she
looked
up
sullenly
into
ethel
face
and
said
i
was
not
to
say
a
wurrd
i
tellin
ye
i
was
just
to
wait
peg
settled
back
in
the
chair
and
stroked
michael
this
questioning
was
not
at
all
to
her
liking
she
wished
hawkes
would
come
and
get
her
out
of
a
most
embarrassing
position
but
until
he
did
she
was
not
going
to
disobey
his
instructions
he
told
her
to
say
nothing
so
nothing
would
she
say
ethel
turned
abruptly
to
brent
and
found
that
gentleman
looking
at
the
odd
little
stranger
somewhat
admiringly
she
gave
an
impatient
ejaculation
and
turned
back
to
peg
quickly
you
say
you
have
only
been
here
a
minute
that
all
replied
peg
just
a
minnit
were
we
talking
when
you
came
in
ye
were
ethel
could
scarcely
conceal
her
rage
did
you
hear
what
we
said
some
of
it
not
much
said
peg
what
did
you
hear
please
do
it
so
hot
this
mornin
said
peg
with
no
attempt
at
imitation
just
as
if
she
were
stating
a
simple
ordinary
occurrence
ethel
flushed
scarlet
brent
smiled
you
refuse
to
say
why
you
here
or
who
you
are
ethel
again
asked
it
is
me
that
refusin
all
the
gentleman
said
to
me
was
go
to
the
place
that
written
down
on
the
card
and
ye
sit
down
there
wait
and
that
all
ye
do
ethel
again
turned
to
the
perplexed
brent
eh
extraordinary
and
brent
shook
his
head
the
position
was
unbearable
ethel
decided
instantly
how
to
relieve
it
she
looked
freezingly
down
at
the
little
intruder
and
said
the
servants
quarters
are
at
the
back
of
the
house
are
they
asked
peg
without
moving
and
not
in
any
way
taking
the
statement
to
refer
to
her
and
i
may
save
you
the
trouble
of
waiting
by
telling
you
we
are
quite
provided
with
servants
we
do
not
need
any
further
assistance
peg
just
looked
at
ethel
and
then
bent
down
over
michael
last
shot
had
struck
home
poor
peg
was
cut
through
to
her
soul
how
she
longed
at
that
moment
to
be
back
home
with
her
father
in
new
york
before
she
could
say
anything
ethel
continued
if
you
insist
on
waiting
kindly
do
so
there
peg
took
michael
up
in
her
arms
collected
once
more
her
packages
and
walked
to
the
windows
again
she
heard
the
cold
hard
tones
of
voice
speaking
to
her
follow
the
path
to
your
right
until
you
come
to
a
door
knock
and
ask
permission
to
wait
there
and
for
your
future
guidance
go
to
the
back
door
of
a
house
and
ring
do
walk
unannounced
into
a
private
room
peg
tried
to
explain
ye
see
i
did
know
all
the
gentleman
said
was
there
and
wait
that
will
do
i
sorry
i
disturbed
yez
and
she
glanced
at
the
embarrassed
brent
that
will
do
said
ethel
finally
poor
peg
nodded
and
wandered
off
through
the
windows
sore
at
heart
she
went
down
the
path
until
she
reached
the
door
ethel
mentioned
she
knocked
at
it
while
she
is
waiting
for
admission
we
will
return
to
the
fortunes
of
the
lovers
chapter
iv
the
chichester
family
receives
a
second
shock
ethel
turned
indignantly
to
brent
as
the
little
figure
went
off
down
the
path
outrageous
she
cried
poor
little
wretch
brent
walked
to
the
windows
and
looked
after
her
she
quite
pretty
ethel
looked
understandingly
at
him
is
she
in
a
shabby
sort
of
way
did
you
think
so
ethel
glared
coldly
at
him
i
never
notice
the
lower
orders
you
apparently
do
oh
yes
often
they
very
interesting
at
times
he
strained
to
get
a
last
glimpse
of
the
intruder
do
you
know
she
the
strangest
little
apparition
she
only
a
few
yards
away
if
you
care
to
follow
her
her
tone
brought
brent
up
sharply
he
turned
away
from
the
window
and
found
ethel
arms
folded
eyes
flashing
waiting
for
him
something
in
her
manner
alarmed
him
he
had
gone
too
far
why
ethel
he
said
as
he
came
toward
her
suppose
my
mother
had
walked
in
here
or
alaric
instead
of
that
creature
never
do
such
a
thing
again
i
was
carried
away
he
hastened
to
explain
kindly
exercise
a
little
more
restraint
you
had
better
go
now
there
was
a
finality
of
dismissal
in
her
tone
as
she
passed
him
and
crossed
to
the
great
staircase
he
followed
her
may
i
call
no
she
answered
decidedly
not
the
following
day
then
he
urged
perhaps
remember
i
build
on
you
she
looked
searchingly
at
him
i
suppose
we
are
worthy
of
each
other
through
the
open
windows
came
the
sound
of
voices
go
she
said
imperatively
and
she
passed
on
up
the
stairs
brent
went
rapidly
to
the
door
before
either
he
could
open
it
or
ethel
go
out
of
sight
alaric
burst
in
through
the
windows
hello
brent
he
cried
cheerfully
disturbin
ye
and
he
caught
ethel
as
she
was
about
to
disappear
or
you
ethel
ethel
turned
and
answered
coolly
you
not
disturbed
me
i
just
going
said
brent
well
wait
a
moment
and
alaric
turned
to
the
window
and
beckoned
to
someone
on
the
path
and
in
from
the
garden
came
montgomery

the

business
that
concerns
the
whole
family
ethel
disappeared
without
a
word
alaric
bustled
hawkes
into
a
chair
and
then
seized
the
somewhat
uncomfortable
brent
by
an
unwilling
hand
and
shook
it
warmly
as
he
asked
must
you
go
yes
replied
brent
with
a
sigh
of
relief
alaric
dashed
to
the
door
and
opened
it
as
though
to
speed
the
visitor
on
his
way
so
sorry

was
out

the
darling

brent
frowned
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
turned
in
the
frame
and
admonished
alaric
please
give
my
remembrances
to
your
mother
then
he
passed
out
as
he
disappeared
the
irrepressible
alaric
called
after
him
certainly
she
be
so
disappointed
not
to
have
seen
you
run
in
any
time
any
time
at
all
alaric
closed
the
door
and
saw
his
mother
and
ethel
coming
down
the
stairs
all
traces
of
emotion
had
disappeared
from
ethel
face
and
manner
she
was
once
again
in
perfect
command
of
herself
she
carried
a
beautiful
little
french
poodle
in
her
arms
and
was
feeding
her
with
sugar
alaric
fussily
brought
his
mother
forward
mater
dear
he
said
i
found
this
gentleman
in
a
enquiring
the
way
to
our
lodge
he
come
all
the
way
from
dear
old
london
just
to
see
you
hawkes
my
mother
chichester
looked
at
hawkes
anxiously
you
have
come
to
see
me
on
a
very
important
and
a
very
private
family
matter
replied
hawkes
gravely
important
private
asked
chichester
in
surprise
we
the
family
hawkes
ventured
alaric
helpfully
chichester
forebodings
came
uppermost
after
the
news
of
the
bank
failure
nothing
would
surprise
her
now
in
the
way
of
calamity
what
could
this
grave
man
want
with
them
her
eyes
filled
is
it
bad
news
she
faltered
oh
dear
no
answered
hawkes
genially
well
is
it
good
news
queried
alaric
in
a
measure
said
the
lawyer
then
for
heaven
sake
get
at
it
you
got
me
all
clammy
we
could
do
with
a
little
good
news
wait
a
minute
is
it
by
any
chance
about
the
bank
no
replied
hawkes
he
cleared
his
throat
and
said
solemnly
and
impressively
to
chichester
it
is
about
your
late
brother
nathaniel
kingsnorth
late
cried
chichester
is
nathaniel
dead
yes
madam
said
hawkes
gravely
he
died
ten
days
ago
chichester
sat
down
and
silently
wept
nathaniel
to
have
died
without
her
being
with
him
to
comfort
him
and
arrange
things
with
him
it
was
most
unfortunate
alaric
tried
to
feel
sorry
but
inasmuch
as
his
uncle
had
always
refused
to
see
him
he
could
not
help
thinking
it
may
have
been
retribution
however
he
tried
to
show
a
fair
and
decent
measure
of
regret
poor
old
nat
he
cried
eh
ethel
never
saw
him
answered
ethel
her
face
and
voice
totally
without
emotion
you
say
he
died
ten
days
ago
asked
chichester
hawkes
bowed
why
was
i
not
informed
the
funeral
there
was
no
funeral
replied
hawkes
no
funeral
said
alaric
in
astonishment
no
replied
the
lawyer
in
obedience
to
his
written
wishes
he
was
cremated
and
no
one
was
present
except
the
chief
executor
and
myself
if
i
may
use
kingsnorth
words
without
giving
pain
he
said
he
so
little
regretted
not
having
seen
any
of
his
relations
for
the
last
twenty
years
of
his
he
was
sure
they
would
regret
equally
little
his
death
on
no
account
was
anyone
to
wear
mourning
for
him
nor
were
they
to
express
any
open
sorrow
would
feel
it
so
why
lie
about
it
i
use
his
own
words
added
hawkes
as
if
disclaiming
all
responsibility
for
such
a
remarkable
point
of
view
what
a
rum
old
bird
remarked
alaric
contemplatively
chichester
wept
as
she
said
he
was
always
the
most
unfeeling
the
most
heartless
the
most
now
in
his
will
interrupted
the
lawyer
producing
a
leather
filled
with
papers
in
his
will
he
repeated
chichester
stopped
crying
eh
a
will
what
said
alaric
beaming
did
the
dear
old
gentleman
leave
a
will
even
ethel
stopped
playing
with
pet
and
listened
languidly
to
the
conversation
hawkes
realising
he
had
their
complete
interest
went
on
importantly
as
kingsnorth
legal
adviser
up
to
the
time
of
his
untimely
death
i
have
come
here
to
make
you
acquainted
with
some
of
its
contents
he
spread
a
document
on
the
table
adjusted
his
and
prepared
to
read
dear
old
nat
said
alaric
reflectively
do
you
remember
mater
we
met
him
at
victoria
station
once
when
i
was
little
more
than
a
baby
yet
i
can
see
him
now
as
plainly
as
if
it
were
yesterday
a
portly
old
buck
with
three
jolly
chins
he
was
white
toward
the
end
and
very
very
thin
said
hawkes
softly
was
he
from
alaric
fancy
that
it
just
shows
mater
does
it
he
bent
eagerly
over
the
table
as
hawkes
traced
some
figures
with
a
pencil
on
one
of
the
pages
of
the
will
how
much
did
he
leave
and
alaric
voice
rose
to
a
pitch
of
interest
his
estate
is
valued
approximately
at
some
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
replied
the
lawyer
alaric
gave
a
long
low
whistle
and
smiled
a
broad
comprehensive
smile
ethel
for
the
first
time
showed
a
gleam
of
genuine
interest
chichester
began
to
cry
again
perhaps
it
was
my
fault
i
see
him
oftener
she
said
alaric
unable
to
curb
his
curiosity
burst
out
with
how
did
the
old
boy
split
it
up
to
his
immediate
relations
he
left
hawkes
looked
up
from
the
will
and
found
three
pairs
of
eyes
fixed
on
him
he
stopped
it
may
be
that
constant
association
with
the
law
courts
destroys
faith
in
human
nature
but
whatever
the
cause
it
seemed
to
hawkes
in
each
of
those
eyes
was
reflected
the
one
dominant
feeling
greed
the
expression
in
the
family
combined
eyes
was
astonishing
in
its
directness
its
barefacedness
it
struck
the
dignified
gentleman
suddenly
dumb
well
well
cried
alaric
how
much
do
stop
right
in
the
middle
of
an
important
thing
like
that
you
make
me
as
nervous
as
a
chicken
hawkes
returned
to
the
will
and
after
looking
at
it
a
moment
without
reading
said
to
his
immediate
relations
kingsnorth
left
i
regret
to
say
nothing
a
momentary
silence
fell
like
a
pall
over
the
stricken
chichester
family
chichester
rose
indignation
flashing
from
the
eyes
that
a
moment
since
showed
a
healthy
hope
nothing
she
cried
incredulously
not
a
to
anyone
ventured
alaric
the
faintest
suspicion
of
a
smile
flitted
across
ethel
face
hawkes
looked
keenly
at
them
and
answered
i
deeply
regret
to
say
nothing
chichester
turned
to
ethel
who
had
begun
to
stroke
pet
again
his
own
flesh
and
blood
cried
the
poor
lady
what
a
shabby
old
beggar
commented
alaric
indignantly
he
was
always
the
most
selfish
the
most
began
chichester
when
hawkes
who
bad
been
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
document
before
him
gave
an
ejaculation
of
relief
ah
here
we
have
it
this
chichester
is
how
kingsnorth
expressed
his
attitude
toward
his
relations
in
his
last
will
and
testament
am
the
only
member
of
the
kingsnorth
family
who
ever
made
any
money
all
my
precious
relations
either
inherited
it
or
married
to
get
it
i
assure
you
began
chichester
alaric
checked
her
half
a
moment
mater
let
us
hear
it
out
to
the
bitter
end
he
must
have
been
an
amusin

gentleman
hawkes
resumed

am
not
going
to
leave
one

the
lawyer
how
extremely
painful
painful
that
not
the
word

i
call
it
corrected
alaric
hawkes
thought
a
moment
then
he
said
under
those
circumstances
perhaps
a
clause
in
the
will
may
have
a
certain
interest
and
an
element
of
relief
as
two
drowning
people
clinging
to
the
proverbial
straws
the
mother
and
son
waited
breathlessly
for
hawkes
to
go
on
ethel
showed
no
interest
whatever
when
kingsnorth
realised
that
he
had
not
very
much
longer
to
live
he
spoke
constantly
of
his
other
sister
angela
resumed
hawkes
angela
cried
chichester
in
surprise
why
she
is
dead
that
was
why
he
spoke
of
her
said
hawkes
gravely
and
not
a
word
of
me
asked
chichester
we
will
come
to
that
a
little
later
and
hawkes
again
referred
to
the
will
it
appears
that
this
sister
angela
married
at
the
age
of
twenty
a
certain
irishman
by
name
and
was
cut
off
by
her
family
the

was
an

of

see
her
i
made
inquiries
and
found
that
the
girl
was
living
with
her
father
in
very
poor
circumstances
in
the
city
of
new
york
we
sent
sufficient
funds
for
the
journey
together
with
a
request
to
the
father
to
allow
her
to
visit
kingsnorth
in
england
the
father
consented
however
before
the
young
girl
sailed
kingsnorth
died
oh
cried
alaric
who
had
been
listening
intently
died
eh
that
was
too
bad
died
before
seeing
her
did
you
let
her
sail
mr
hawkes
yes
we
thought
it
best
to
bring
her
over
here
and
acquaint
her
with
the
sad
news
after
her
arrival
had
she
known
before
sailing
she
might
not
have
taken
the
journey
but
what
was
the
use
of
bringing
her
over
when
kingsnorth
was
dead
asked
alaric
for
this
reason
replied
hawkes
realising
that
he
might
never
see
her
kingsnorth
made
the
most
remarkable
provision
for
her
in
his
will
provided
for
her
and
not
for
began
chichester
here
is
the
provision
continued
hawkes
again
reading
from
the
will
hereby
direct
that
the
sum
of
one
thousand
pounds
a
year
be
paid
to
any
respectable
woman
of
breeding
and
family
who
will
undertake
the
education
and
of
my
niece
margaret
in
accordance
with
the
dignity
and
tradition
of
the
kingsnorths
he
remembers
a
niece
he
never
saw
and
his
own
sister
and
chichester
once
more
burst
into
tears
it
beats
that
all
i
can
say
cried
alaric
it
simply
beats
hawkes
went
on
reading
at
the
expiration
of
one
year
my
niece
is
found
to
be
in
the
judgment
of
my
executors
unworthy
of
further
interest
she
is
to
be
returned
to
her
father
and
the
sum
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
paid
her
to
provide
her
with
the
necessities
of
life
if
on
the
other
hand
she
proves
herself
worthy
of
the
best
traditions
of
the
kingsnorth
family
the
course
of
training
is
to
be
continued
until
she
reaches
the
age
of
when
i
hereby
bequeath
to
her
the
sum
of
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
to
be
paid
to
her
annually
out
of
my
estate
during
her
and
to
be
continued
after
her
death
to
any
male
issue
she
may
have
by
marriage
hawkes
stopped
and
once
again
looked
at
the
strange
family
chichester
was
sobbing
and
me
his
own
sister
alaric
was
moving
restlessly
about
beats
any
thing
i
heard
of
positively
anything
ethel
was
looking
intently
at
pet
coat
hawkes
continued
no
account
is
her
father
to
be
permitted
to
visit
her
and
should
the
course
of
training
be
continued
after
the
first
year
she
must
not
on
any
account
visit
her
father
after
she
reaches
the
age
of
she
can
do
as
she
pleases
hawkes
folded
up
the
will
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
finished
an
important
duty
alaric
burst
out
with
i
do
see
how
that
clause
interests
us
in
the
least
mr
hawkes
the
lawyer
removed
his
and
looking
steadily
at
chichester
said
now
my
dear
chichester
it
was
kingsnorth
wish
that
the
first
lady
to
be
approached
on
the
matter
of
undertaking
the
training
of
the
young
lady
should
be
you
chichester
rose
in
astonishment
i
alaric
arose
in
anger
my
mother
ethel
quietly
pulled
pet
ear
and
waited
hawkes
went
on
quietly
kingsnorth
said
would
be
sure
at
least
of
his
niece
having
a
strict
in
the
best
traditions
of
the
kingsnorths
and
that
though
his
sister
monica
was
somewhat
narrow
and
conventional
in
ideas
i
use
his
own
words
he
felt
sure
she
was
eminently
fitted
to
undertake
such
a
charge
there
you
have
the
whole
object
of
my
visit
now
will
you
undertake
the
training
of
the
young
lady
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
cried
chichester
furiously
ridiculous
said
ethel
calmly
tush
and
nonsense
with
which
alaric
dismissed
the
whole
matter
then
i
may
take
it
you
refuse
queried
the
astonished
lawyer
absolutely
from
chichester
entirely
from
ethel
i
should
say
so
and
alaric
brought
up
the
rear
hawkes
gathered
up
his
papers
and
in
a
tone
of
regret
ventured
then
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
i
was
only
carrying
out
the
dead
man
wishes
by
coming
here
and
making
the
facts
known
to
you
kingsnorth
was
of
the
opinion
that
you
were
well
provided
for
and
that
outside
of
the
sentimental
reason
that
the
girl
was
your
own
niece
the
additional
thousand
pounds
a
year
might
be
welcome
as
say
for
your
daughter
ethel
laughed
her
dry
cheerless
little
laugh
ha
alaric
grew
suddenly
grave
and
drew
his
mother
and
sister
out
of
hawkes
vicinity
listen
mater
ethel
it
a
cool
thousand
you
know
thousands
grow
on
raspberry
bushes
when
your
bank
gone
up
what
do
ye
think
eh
chichester
brightened
it
would
keep
things
together
she
said
the
wolf
from
the
door
urged
alaric
no
charity
chimed
in
ethel
chichester
looked
from
daughter
to
son
well
what
do
you
think
whatever
you
say
mater
from
alaric
you
decide
mamma
from
ethel
we
might
try
it
for
a
while
at
least
said
chichester
until
we
can
look
around
agreed
alaric
something
may
be
saved
from
the
wreck
reasoned
chichester
more
hopefully
until
get
really
started
said
alaric
with
a
sense
of
climax
chichester
turned
to
her
daughter
ethel
whatever
you
decide
mamma
chichester
thought
a
moment
then
decided
i
do
it
she
said
determinedly
it
will
be
hard
but
i
do
it
she
went
slowly
and
deliberately
to
hawkes
who
by
this
time
had
disposed
of
all
his
documents
and
was
preparing
to
go
a
look
in
chichester
face
stopped
him
he
smiled
at
her
well
he
asked
for
the
sake
of
the
memory
of
my
dead
sister
i
will
do
as
nathaniel
wished
said
chichester
with
great
dignity
and
hawkes
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
good
he
said
i
delighted
it
is
splendid
now
that
you
have
decided
so
happily
there
is
one
thing
more
i
must
tell
you
the
young
lady
is
not
to
be
told
the
conditions
of
the
will
unless
at
the
discretion
of
the
executors
should
some
crisis
arise
she
will
be
to
all
intents
and
purposes
your
guest
in
that
way
we
may
be
able
to
arrive
at
a
more
exact
knowledge
of
her
character
is
that
understood
the
family
signified
severally
and
collectively
that
it
was
and
now
beamed
the
lawyer
happy
at
the
fortunate
outcome
of
a
situation
that
a
few
moments
before
seemed
so
strained
where
is
your
bell
alaric
indicated
the
bell
may
i
ring
asked
the
lawyer
certainly
replied
alaric
hawkes
rang
alaric
watched
him
curiously
want
a
sandwich
or
something
hawkes
smiled
benignly
on
the
unfortunate
family
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
now
i
would
like
to
send
for
the
young
lady
the
heiress
where
is
she
asked
chichester
she
arrived
from
new
york
this
morning
and
i
brought
her
straight
here
i
had
to
call
on
a
client
so
i
gave
her
your
address
and
told
her
to
come
here
and
wait
at
the
word
wait
an
uneasy
feeling
took
possession
of
ethel
that
was
the
word
used
by
that
little
creature
who
had
so
rudely
intruded
upon
her
and
brent
could
it
be
possible
the
footman
entered
at
that
moment
the
lawyer
questioned
him
is
there
a
young
lady
waiting
for
mr
hawkes
a
young
lady
sir
no
sir
answered
jarvis
hawkes
was
puzzled
what
in
the
world
had
become
of
her
he
told
the
cabman
distinctly
where
to
go
jarvis
opened
the
door
to
go
out
when
a
thought
suddenly
occurred
to
him
he
turned
back
and
spoke
to
the
lawyer
there
a
young
person
sitting
in
the
kitchen
came
up
and
knocked
at
the
door
and
said
she
had
to
wait
until
a
gentleman
called
ca
get
nothin
out
of
her
hawkes
brightened
up
that
must
be
miss
he
said
he
turned
to
chichester
and
asked
her
if
he
might
bring
the
young
lady
in
there
my
niece
in
the
kitchen
said
chichester
to
the
unfortunate
footman
surely
you
should
know
the
difference
between
my
niece
and
a
servant
i
am
truly
sorry
madam
replied
jarvis
in
distress
but
there
was
nothing
to
tell
another
such
mistake
and
you
can
leave
my
employment
chichester
added
severely
jarvis
pleaded
piteously
upon
my
word
madam
no
one
could
tell
that
will
do
thundered
chichester
bring
my
niece
here
at
once
the
wretched
jarvis
departed
on
his
errand
muttering
to
himself
wait
until
they
see
her
who
in
the
world
could
tell
she
was
their
relation
chichester
was
very
angry
it
monstrous
she
exclaimed
stoopid
agreed
alaric
doocid
stoopid
ethel
said
nothing
the
one
thought
that
was
passing
through
her
mind
was
how
much
did
that
girl
hear
brent
say
and
how
much
did
she
see
brent
do
hawkes
tried
to
smooth
the
misunderstanding
out
i
am
afraid
it
was
all
my
fault
he
explained
i
told
her
not
to
talk
to
just
say
that
she
was
to
wait
i
wanted
to
have
an
opportunity
to
explain
matters
before
introducing
her
she
should
have
been
brought
straight
to
me
complained
chichester
the
poor
thing
then
with
a
feeling
of
outraged
pride
she
said
my
niece
in
kitchen
a
kingsnorth
mistaken
for
a
servant
the
door
opened
and
jarvis
came
into
the
room
there
was
a
look
of
on
his
face
as
much
as
to
say
now
who
would
not
make
a
mistake
like
that
who
could
tell
this
girl
was
your
niece
he
beckoned
peg
to
come
into
the
room
then
the
chichester
family
received
the
second
shock
they
had
experienced
that
day
one
compared
with
which
the
failure
of
the
bank
paled
into
insignificance
when
they
saw
the
strange
shabby
girl
slouch
into
the
room
with
her
parcels
and
that
dog
they
felt
the
hand
of
misfortune
had
indeed
fallen
upon
them
chapter
v
pegs
meets
her
aunt
as
peg
wandered
into
the
room
chichester
and
alaric
looked
at
her
in
horrified
amazement
ethel
took
one
swift
glance
at
her
and
then
turned
her
attention
to
pet
jarvis
looked
reproachfully
at
chichester
as
much
as
to
say
what
did
i
tell
you
and
went
out
alaric
whispered
to
his
mother
oh
i
say
really
you
know
it
is
true
it
ca
be
pet
suddenly
saw
michael
and
began
to
bark
furiously
at
him
michael
responded
vigorously
until
peg
quieted
him
at
this
juncture
hawkes
came
forward
and
taking
peg
gently
by
the
arm
reassured
her
by
saying
come
here
my
dear
come
here
do
be
frightened
we
all
your
friends
he
brought
peg
over
to
chichester
who
was
staring
at
her
with
tears
of
mortification
in
her
eyes
when
peg
eyes
met
her
aunt
she
bobbed
a
little
curtsey
she
used
to
do
as
a
child
whenever
she
met
a
priest
or
some
of
the
gentle
folk
chichester
went
cold
when
she
saw
the
gauche
act
was
it
possible
that
this
creature
was
her
sister
angela
child
it
seemed
incredible
what
is
your
name
she
asked
sternly
peg
what
sure
me
name
peg
and
she
bobbed
another
little
curtsey
chichester
closed
her
eyes
and
shivered
she
asked
alaric
to
ring
as
that
young
gentleman
passed
ethel
on
his
way
to
the
bell
he
said
it
ca
really
be
true
eh
ethel
quaint
was
all
his
sister
replied
hawkes
genially
drew
peg
attention
to
her
aunt
by
introducing
her
this
lady
is
chichester
your
aunt
peg
looked
at
her
doubtfully
a
moment
then
turned
to
hawkes
and
asked
him
where
me
uncle
alas
my
dear
child
your
uncle
is
dead
dead
exclaimed
peg
in
surprise
afther
sendin
for

just
before

added
hawkes
god

his
soul
said
peg
piously
sure

that

at
all
i
too
late
then
good
day
to
yez
and
she
started
for
the
door
hawkes
stopped
her
where
are
you
going
back
to
me
father
oh

but
i
must
go
back

has
kindly
consented
to
give
you
a
home
peg
gazed
at
chichester
curiously
have
yez
she
asked
chichester
with
despair
in
every
tone
replied
i
have
thank
yez
said
peg
bobbing
another
little
curtsey
at
which
chichester
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hand
as
if
to
shut
out
some
painful
sight
peg
looked
at
chichester
and
at
the
significant
action
there
was
no
mistaking
its
significance
it
conveyed
dislike
and
contempt
so
plainly
that
peg
felt
it
through
her
whole
nature
she
turned
to
alaric
and
found
him
regarding
her
as
though
she
were
some
strange
animal
ethel
did
not
deign
to
notice
her
and
this
was
the
family
her
father
had
sent
her
over
to
england
to
be
put
in
amongst
she
whispered
to
hawkes
i
ca
stay
here
why
not
asked
the
lawyer
i
be
happier
with
me
father
said
peg
nonsense
you
be
quite
happy
here
quite
they
do
seem
enthusiastic
about
us
do
they
and
she
looked
down
at
michael
and
up
at
hawkes
and
indicated
the
chichester
family
who
had
by
this
time
all
turned
their
backs
on
her
she
smiled
a
wan
lonely
smile
and
with
a
little
pressure
on
michael
back
murmured
we
not
wanted
here
the
terrier
looked
up
at
her
and
then
buried
his
head
under
her
arm
as
though
ashamed
jarvis
came
in
response
to
the
ring
at
that
moment
bearing
a
pained
expression
on
his
face
chichester
directed
him
to
take
away
peg
parcels
and
the
dog
peg
frightenedly
clutched
the
terrier
oh
no
she
pleaded
plaze
lave
with
me
do
take
him
away
from
me

it
away
commanded
chichester
severely
and
never
let
it
inside
the
house
again
well
if
ye
do
want
him
inside
yer
house
ye
do
want
me
inside
yer
house
peg
snapped
back
hawkes
interposed
oh
come
come
miss
you
can
see
the
little
dog
whenever
you
want
to
and
he
tried
to
take
michael
out
of
her
arms
come
let
me
have
him
but
peg
resisted
she
was
positive
when
she
said
no
i
wo

him
up
i
wo
i
had
a
hard
enough
time
gettin
him
ashore
i
did
hawkes
pleaded
again
no
said
peg
firmly
i
will
not
give
him
up
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
the
lawyer
tried
again
to
take
the
dog
from
her
come
miss
you
really
must
be
reasonable
i
do
care
about
being
reasonable
replied
peg
was
given
to
me
by
me
father
an
he
not
very
big
and
he
not
a
watchdog
he
a
pet
dog
and
look
she
caught
sight
of
ethel
little
poodle
and
with
a
cry
of
she
said
see
she
has
a
dog
in
the
house
right
here
in
the
house
look
at
it
and
she
pointed
to
where
the
little
ball
of
white
wool
lay
sleeping
on
ethel
lap
then
peg
laughed
heartily
i
did
know
what
it
was
until
it
moved
peg
finally
weakened
under
hawkes
powers
of
persuasion
and
on
the
understanding
that
she
could
see
him
whenever
she
wanted
to
permitted
the
lawyer
to
take
michael
out
of
her
arms
and
give
him
to
the
disgusted
footman
who
held
him
at
arm
length
in
mingled
fear
and
disgust
then
hawkes
took
the
bag
and
the
parcels
and
handed
them
also
to
jarvis
one
of
them
burst
open
disclosing
her
father
parting
gifts
she
kept
the
rosary
and
the
miniature
and
wrapping
up
the
others
carefully
she
placed
them
on
the
top
of
the
other
articles
in
the
outraged
jarvis
arms
and
then
gave
him
her
final
injunctions
patting
michael
on
the
head
she
said
to
the
footman
ye
wo
hurt
him
will
ye
michael
at
that
stage
licked
her
hand
and
whined
as
though
he
knew
they
were
to
be
separated
peg
comforted
him
and
went
on
and
i
be
much
obliged
to
ye
if
ye
give
him
some
wather
and
a
bone
he
loves
mutton
bones
jarvis
with
as
much
dignity
as
he
could
assume
considering
that
he
had
one
armful
of
shabby
parcels
and
the
other
hand
holding
at
length
a
disgraceful
looking
mongrel
went
out
almost
on
the
verge
of
tears
peg
looked
down
and
found
alaric
sitting
at
a
desk
near
the
door
staring
at
her
in
disgust
he
was
such
a
funny
looking
little
fellow
to
peg
that
she
could
not
feel
any
resentment
toward
him
his
sleek
hair
his
carefully
creased
and
clothes
his
and
above
all
his
absolute
assurance
that
whatever
he
did
was
right
amused
peg
immensely
he
was
an
entirely
new
type
of
young
man
to
her
and
she
was
interested
she
smiled
at
him
now
in
a
friendly
way
and
said
ye
must
know
is
simply
crazy
about
mutton
he
loves
mutton
alaric
turned
indignantly
away
from
her
peg
followed
him
up
he
had
begun
to
fascinate
her
she
looked
at
his
with
a
bow
gleaming
from
the
centre
at
his
pointed
shoes
his
curious
little
querulous
look
he
was
going
to
be
good
fun
for
peg
she
wanted
to
begin
at
once
and
she
would
have
too
not
the
icy
accents
of
chichester
interrupted
peg
plans
for
the
moment
come
here
called
chichester
peg
walked
over
to
her
and
when
she
got
almost
beside
the
old
lady
she
turned
to
have
another
glimpse
at
alaric
and
gave
him
a
little
chuckling
laugh
look
at
me
commanded
chichester
sternly
yes
replied
peg
with
a
little
curtsey
chichester
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
what
was
to
be
done
with
this
barbarian
why
should
this
affliction
be
thrust
upon
her
then
she
thought
of
the
thousand
pounds
a
year
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
severely
at
peg
do
call
me
she
said
no
replied
peg
nervously
then
instantly
corrected
herself
no
ant
no
ant
aunt
said
chichester
haughtily
aunt
not
ant
alaric
commented
to
ethel
ant
like
some
little
crawly
insect
peg
heard
him
looked
at
him
and
laughed
he
certainly
was
odd
then
she
looked
at
ethel
then
at
hawkes
then
all
round
the
room
as
if
she
missed
someone
finally
she
faced
chichester
again
are
you
me
uncle
nat
widdy
no
i
am
not
contradicted
the
old
lady
sharply
then
how
are
you
me
aunt
demanded
peg
i
am
your
mother
sister
replied
chichester
oh
cried
peg
then
your
name
monica
it
is
what
do
ye
think
of
that
said
peg
under
her
breath
she
surreptitiously
opened
out
the
miniature
and
looked
at
it
then
she
scrutinised
her
aunt
she
shook
her
head
ye
do
look
a
bit
like
me
poor
mother
did
what
have
you
there
asked
chichester
me
poor
mother
picture
replied
peg
softly
let
me
see
it
and
chichester
held
out
her
hand
for
it
peg
showed
it
to
chichester
all
the
while
keeping
a
jealous
hold
on
a
corner
of
the
frame
no
one
would
ever
take
it
away
from
her
the
old
lady
looked
at
it
intently
finally
she
said
she
had
changed
very
much
since
i
last
saw
her
and
in
one
year
sorrow
and
poverty
did
that
aunt
monica
and
the
tears
sprang
unbidden
into
peg
eyes
aunt
will
be
quite
sufficient
put
it
away
and
chichester
released
the
miniature
peg
hid
it
immediately
in
her
bosom
sit
down
directed
the
old
lady
in
the
manner
of
a
judge
preparing
to
condemn
a
felon
peg
sprawled
into
a
chair
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
thank
ye
ant
aunt
she
said
then
she
looked
at
them
all
alternately
and
laughed
heartily
sure
i
had
no
idea
in
the
wurrld
i
had
such
fine
relations
although
of
course
my
father
often
said
to
me
peg
he
would
say
peg
ye
got
some
grand
folks
on
yer
mother
side
folks
really
ethel
cried
alaric
disgustedly
yes
that
what
he
said
grand
folks
on
me
mother
side
chichester
silenced
peg
that
will
do
do
sprawl
in
that
way
sit
up
try
and
remember
where
you
are
look
at
your
cousin
and
the
mother
indicated
ethel
peg
sat
up
demurely
and
looked
at
ethel
she
chuckled
to
herself
as
she
turned
back
to
chichester
is
she
me
cousin
she
is
replied
the
mother
and
i
am
too
said
alaric
cousin
alaric
peg
looked
him
all
over
and
laughed
openly
then
she
turned
to
ethel
again
and
then
looked
all
around
the
room
and
appeared
quite
puzzled
finally
she
asked
chichester
the
following
amazing
question
where
her
husband
ethel
sprang
to
her
feet
the
blow
was
going
to
fall
she
was
to
be
disgraced
before
her
family
by
that
it
was
unbearable
chichester
said
in
astonishment
her
husband
yes
replied
peg
insistently
i
saw
her
husband
when
i
came
in
here
first
i
been
in
this
room
before
ye
know
i
came
in
through
those
windows
and
i
saw
her
and
her
husband
she
was
what
in
heaven
name
does
she
mean
cried
alaric
peg
persisted
i
tell
ye
it
was
she
sent
me
to
the
kitchen
she
and
him
him
who
in
the
world
does
she
mean
from
alaric
to
whom
does
she
refer
ethel
from
chichester
brent
said
ethel
with
admirable
she
was
on
thin
ice
but
she
must
keep
calm
nothing
may
come
out
yet
if
only
she
can
silence
that
little
chatterbox
alaric
burst
out
laughing
chichester
looked
relieved
peg
went
on
sure
she
thought
i
was
a
servant
looking
for
a
place
and
hawkes
told
me
not
to
say
a
word
until
he
came
and
i
did
say
a
word
hawkes
now
broke
in
and
glancing
at
his
watch
said
my
time
is
short
miss
it
was
your
uncle
wish
that
you
should
make
your
home
here
with
chichester

will
give
you
every
possible
advantage
to
make
you
a
happy
for
charming
young
lady

laughed
lady
me
sure

the
lawyer
went
on

do
everything
she
tells
you
try
and
please
her
in
all
things
on
the
first
day
of

month

and
find

what
progress
you
making
he
handed
chichester
a
card
this
is
my
business
address
should
you
wish
to
communicate
with
me
and
now
i
must
take
my
leave
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
cane
from
the
table
peg
sprang
up
breathlessly
and
frightenedly
now
that
hawkes
was
going
she
felt
deserted
he
had
at
least
been
gentle
and
considerate
to
her
she
tugged
at
his
sleeve
and
looked
straight
up
into
his
face
with
her
big
blue
eyes
wide
open
and
pleaded
plaze
sir

me
with
ye
and
send
me

her
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
might
like
me
to
stay
here
now
that
me

dead
why
it
was
your
uncle
last
wish
that
you
should
come
here

father
will
be
delighted
at
your
good
fortune
he
gently
pressed
her
back
into
the
chair
and
smiled
pleasantly
and
reassuringly
down
at
her
just
when
he
had
negotiated
everything
most
satisfactorily
to
have
peg
endeavour
to
upset
it
all
was
most
disturbing
he
went
on
again
your
aunt
will
do
everything
in
her
power
to
make
you
feel
at
home
you
mrs
chichester
everything
said
chichester
as
if
she
were
walking
over
her
own
grave
peg
looked
at
her
aunt
ruefully
her
expression
was
most
forbidding
at
ethel
expressive
back
lastly
at
alaric
fitting
a
cigarette
into
a
gold
mounted
holder
her
whole
nature
cried
out
against
them
she
made
one
last
appeal
to
hawkes
do
send
me
back
to
me
father
nonsense
my
dear
miss
you
would
not
disappoint
your
father
in
that
way
would
you
wait
for
a
month
i
call
on
the
first
and
i
expect
to
hear
only
the
most
charming
things
about
you
now
and
he
took
her
hand
she
looked
wistfully
up
at
him
sir
and
thank
ye
very
much
for
bein
so
kind
to
me
hawkes
bowed
to
chichester
and
ethel
and
went
to
the
door
have
a
cab
asked
alaric
no
thank
you
replied
the
lawyer
i
have
no
luggage
like
the
walk
and
peg
only
friend
in
england
passed
out
and
left
her
to
face
this
terrible
english
family
alone
your
name
is
margaret
said
chichester
as
the
door
closed
on
hawkes
no
peg
began
but
immediately
corrected
herself
no
aunt
i
beg
your
pardon
no
aunt
my
name
is
peg
cried
she
earnestly
that
is
only
a
corruption
we
will
call
you
margaret
insisted
chichester
dismissing
the
subject
once
and
for
all
but
peg
was
not
to
be
turned
so
lightly
aside
she
stuck
to
her
point
i
would
know
myself
as
margaret
indade
i
would
i
might
forget
to
answer
to
the
name
of
margaret
she
stopped
her
pleading
tone
and
said
determinedly
my
name
is
peg
then
a
little
softer
and
more
plaintively
she
added
me
father
always
calls
me
peg
it
would
put
me
in
mind
of
me
father
if
you
let
me
be
called
peg
aunt
she
ended
her
plea
with
a
little
yearning
cry
kindly
leave
your
father
out
of
the
conversation
snapped
the
old
lady
severely
then
it
all
i
will
lave
him
out
of
cried
peg
springing
up
and
confronting
the
stately
lady
of
the
house
chichester
regarded
her
in
astonishment
and
anger
no
temper
if
you
please
and
she
motioned
peg
to
resume
her
seat
poor
peg
sat
down
breathing
hard
her
fingers
locking
and
unlocking
her
staunch
little
heart
aching
for
the
one
human
being
she
was
told
not
to
refer
to
this
house
was
not
going
to
hold
her
a
prisoner
if
her
father
name
was
to
be
slighted
or
ignored
on
that
point
she
was
determined
back
to
america
she
would
go
if
her
father
name
was
ever
insulted
before
her
chichester
voice
broke
the
silence
you
must
take
my
daughter
as
your
model
in
all
things
peg
looked
at
ethel
and
all
her
anger
vanished
temporarily
the
idea
of
taking
that
young
lady
as
a
model
appealed
to
her
as
being
irresistibly
amusing
she
smiled
broadly
at
ethel
chichester
went
on
everything
my
daughter
does
you
must
try
and
imitate
you
could
not
have
a
better
example
mould
yourself
on
her
imitate
her
is
it
asked
peg
innocently
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
and
the
suggestion
of
impishness
in
her
manner
so
far
as
lies
in
your
power
replied
chichester
a
picture
of
ethel
struggling
in
brent
arms
suddenly
flashed
across
peg
and
before
she
could
restrain
herself
she
had
said
in
exact
imitation
of
her
cousin
please
do
it
is
so
hot
this
morning
then
peg
laughed
loudly
to
ethel
horror
and
chichester
disgust
how
dare
you
cried
her
aunt
peg
looked
at
her
a
moment
all
the
mirth
died
away
must
i
laugh
in
this
house
she
asked
you
have
a
great
deal
to
learn
yes
aunt
your
education
will
begin
sure
that
will
be
foine
and
she
chuckled
no
levity
if
you
please
said
her
aunt
severely
no
aunt
until
some
decent
clothes
can
be
procured
for
you
we
will
find
some
from
my
daughter
wardrobe
sure
i
a
beautiful
dhress
in
me
satchel
i
go
to
mass
in
on
sundays
it
all
silk
and
chichester
stopped
her
that
will
do
ring
alaric
please
as
alaric
walked
over
to
press
the
electric
button
he
looked
at
peg
in
absolute
disgust
and
entire
disapproval
peg
caught
the
look
and
watched
him
go
slowly
across
the
room
he
had
the
same
morbid
fascination
for
her
that
some
uncanny
elfish
creature
might
have
if
only
her
father
could
see
him
she
mentally
decided
to
sketch
alaric
and
send
it
out
to
her
father
with
a
full
description
of
him
chichester
again
demanded
her
attention
you
must
try
and
realise
that
you
have
an
opportunity
few
girls
in
your
position
are
ever
given
i
only
hope
you
will
try
and
repay
our
interest
and
your
late
uncle
wishes
by
obedience
good
conduct
and
hard
study
yes
aunt
said
peg
demurely
then
she
added
quickly
i
hope
ye
do
mind
me
not
having
worn
me
silk
dress
but
ye
see
i
could
wear
it
on
the
steamer

thravellin
clothes

chichester
sharply
well
but
i
do

buy
me
pretty
clothes
he
very
proud
of
me

i

commanded
chichester
as
jarvis
came
in
reply
to
the
bell
tell
bennett
to
show
my
niece
to
the
mauve
room
and
to
attend
her
said
chichester
to
the
footman
then
turning
to
peg
she
dismissed
her
go
with
him
yes
aunt
replied
peg
an
i
am
goin
to
thry
and
do
everythin
ye
want
me
to
i
will
indade
i
will
her
little
heart
was
craving
for
some
show
of
kindness
if
she
was
going
to
stay
there
she
would
make
the
best
of
it
she
would
make
some
friendly
advances
to
them
she
held
her
hand
out
to
chichester
i
sure
i
very
grateful
to
you
for
taking
me
to
live
with
yez
here
an
me
father
will
be
too
but
ye
see
it
all
so
strange
to
me
here
an
i
so
far
away
an
i
miss
me
father
so
much
chichester
ignoring
the
outstretched
hand
stopped
her
peremptorily
go
with
him
and
she
pointed
up
the
stairs
on
the
first
landing
of
which
stood
the
portly
jarvis
waiting
to
conduct
peg
out
of
the
family
sight
peg
dropped
a
little
curtsey
to
chichester
smiled
at
ethel
looked
loftily
at
alaric
then
ran
up
the
stairs
and
following
the
footman
index
finger
pointing
the
way
she
disappeared
from
chichester
unhappy
gaze
the
three
tortured
people
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
awful
said
alaric
terrible
agreed
chichester
dreadful
nodded
ethel
it
our
unlucky
day
mater
added
alaric
one
thing
is
absolutely
necessary
chichester
went
on
to
say
she
must
be
kept
away
from
every
one
for
the
present
i
should
say
so
cried
alaric
energetically
suddenly
he
ejaculated
good
lord
jerry
he
must
see
her
he
laugh
his
head
off
at
the
idea
of
my
having
a
relation
like
her
he
probably
run
in
to
lunch
then
she
must
remain
in
her
room
until
he
gone
said
chichester
determinedly
i
go
into
town
now
and
order
some
things
for
her
and
see
about
tutors
she
must
be
taught
and
at
once
why
put
up
with
this
annoyance
at
all
asked
ethel
for
the
first
time
showing
any
real
interest
chichester
put
her
arm
around
ethel
and
a
gentle
look
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
said
one
thousand
pounds
a
year
that
is
the
reason
and
rather
than
you
or
alaric
should
have
to
make
any
sacrifice
dear
or
have
any
discomfort
i
would
put
up
with
worse
than
that
ethel
thought
a
moment
before
she
replied
reflectively
yes
i
suppose
you
would
i
would
and
she
went
up
the
stairs
when
she
was
little
more
than
half
way
up
alaric
who
had
been
watching
her
nervously
called
to
her
where
are
you
off
to
ethel
she
looked
down
at
him
and
a
glow
all
unsuspected
came
into
her
eyes
and
a
line
of
colour
ran
through
her
cheeks
and
there
was
an
unusual
tremor
in
her
voice
as
she
replied
to
try
to
make
up
my
mind
if
i
can
about
something
the
coming
of
peg
may
do
it
for
me
she
went
on
out
of
sight
alaric
was
to
follow
her
he
knew
she
was
taking
their
bad
luck
to
heart
withal
she
said
so
little
he
was
really
quite
fond
of
ethel
in
a
selfish
brotherly
way
but
for
the
moment
he
decided
to
let
ethel
worry
it
out
alone
while
he
would
go
to
the
railway
station
and
meet
his
friend
train
he
called
to
his
mother
as
she
passed
through
the
door
wait
a
minute
mater
and
i
go
with
you
as
far
as
the
and
see
if
i
can
head
jerry
off
his
train
is
almost
due
if
punctual
he
was
genuinely
concerned
that
his
old
chum
should
not
meet
that
impossible
little
irish
heathen
whom
an
unkind
fate
had
dropped
down
in
their
midst
at
the
chichester
told
jarvis
that
her
niece
was
not
to
leave
her
room
without
permission
as
chichester
and
alaric
passed
out
they
little
dreamt
that
the
same
relentless
fate
was
planning
still
further
humiliations
for
the
unfortunate
family
and
through
the
new
and
unwelcome
addition
to
it
chapter
vi
jerry
peg
was
shown
by
the
maid
bennett
into
a
charming
room
overlooking
the
rose
garden
everything
about
it
was
in
the
most
exquisite
taste
the
furniture
was
of
white
and
gold
the
vases
of
sevres
a
few
admirable
prints
on
the
walls
and
roses
everywhere
left
to
her
reflections
poor
peg
found
herself
wondering
how
people
with
so
much
that
was
beautiful
around
them
could
live
and
act
as
the
chichester
family
apparently
did
they
seemed
to
borrow
nothing
from
their
once
illustrious
and
prosperous
dead
they
were
it
would
appear
only
concerned
with
a
particularly
near
present
the
splendour
of
the
house
awed
the
narrowness
of
the
people
irritated
her
what
an
unequal
condition
of
things
where
such
people
were
endowed
with
so
much
of
the
world
goods
while
her
father
had
to
struggle
all
his
life
for
the
bare
necessities
she
had
heard
her
father
say
once
that
the
only
value
money
had
outside
of
one
immediate
requirements
was
to
be
able
to
relieve
other
people
misery
and
that
if
we
just
spent
it
on
ourselves
money
became
a
monster
that
stripped
life
of
all
happiness
all
illusion
all
love
and
made
it
just
a
selfish
mockery
of
a
world
how
wonderfully
true
her
father
diagnosis
was
here
was
a
family
with
everything
to
make
them
happy
yet
none
of
them
seemed
to
breathe
a
happy
breath
think
a
happy
thought
or
know
a
happy
hour
the
maid
had
placed
peg
scanty
assortment
of
articles
on
the
they
looked
so
sadly
out
of
place
amid
the
boxes
and
perfumed
drawers
that
peg
felt
another
momentary
feeling
of
shame
since
her
coming
into
the
house
she
had
experienced
a
series
of
awakenings
she
sturdily
overcame
the
feeling
and
changed
her
cheap
little
travelling
suit
for
one
of
the
silk
dresses
her
father
had
bought
her
in
new
york
by
the
time
she
had
arranged
her
hair
with
a
big
pink
ribbon
and
put
on
the
precious
brown
silk
garment
she
began
to
feel
more
at
ease
after
all
who
were
they
to
intimidate
her
if
she
did
not
like
the
house
and
the
people
after
giving
them
a
fair
trial
she
would
go
back
to
new
york
very
much
comforted
by
the
reflection
and
having
exhausted
all
the
curious
things
in
the
little
she
determined
to
see
the
rest
of
the
house
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
she
met
the
maid
bennett
chichester
left
word
that
you
were
not
to
leave
your
room
without
permission
i
was
just
going
to
tell
you
said
bennett
all
peg
independent
irish
blood
flared
up
what
would
she
be
doing
shut
up
in
a
little
room
all
day
she
answered
the
maid
excitedly
tell
i
am
not
goin
to
do
anythin
of
the
kind
as
long
as
i
stay
in
this
house
i
see
every
bit
of
it
and
she
swept
past
the
maid
down
the
stairs
into
the
same
room
for
the
third
time
you
only
get
me
into
trouble
cried
the
maid
no
i
wo
i
would
get
you
into
trouble
for
the
wurrld
i
get
all
the
trouble
and
i
get
it
now
peg
ran
across
opened
the
door
connecting
with
the
hall
and
called
out
at
the
top
of
her
voice
aunt
cousins
aunt
come
here
i
want
to
tell
ye
about
myself
they
all
gone
out
said
the
maid
quickly
then
what
are
ye
makin
such
a
fuss
about
you
go
out
too
she
watched
the
disappointed
bennett
leave
the
room
and
then
began
a
tour
of
inspection
she
had
never
seen
so
many
strange
things
outside
of
a
museum
fierce
men
in
armour
glared
at
her
out
of
massive
frames
old
gentlemen
in
powdered
wigs
smiled
pleasantly
at
her
haughty
ladies
in
coiffures
stared
superciliously
right
through
her
she
felt
most
uncomfortable
in
such
strange
company
she
turned
from
the
gallery
and
entered
the
living
room
everything
about
it
was
of
the
solid
tudor
days
and
bespoke
even
as
the
portraits
a
period
when
the
family
must
have
been
of
some
considerable
importance
she
wandered
about
the
room
touching
some
things
timidly
others
boldly
for
example
on
the
piano
she
found
a
perfectly
carved
bronze
statuette
of
cupid
she
gave
a
little
elfish
cry
of
delight
took
the
statuette
in
her
arms
and
kissed
it
cupid
me
darlin
faith
it
you
that
causes
all
the
mischief
in
the
wurrld
ye
divil
ye
she
cried
all
her
depression
vanished
she
was
like
a
child
again
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
played
the
simple
refrain
and
sang
in
her
little
girlish
tremulous
voice
one
of
her
father
favourite
songs
her
eyes
on
cupid
oh
the
days
are
gone
when
beauty
bright
my
heart
charm
wove
when
my
dream
of
life
from
morn
till
night
was
love
still
love
new
hope
may
bloom
and
days
may
come
of
milder
calmer
beam
but
there
nothing
half
so
sweet
in
life
as
love
young
dream
no
there
nothing
half
so
sweet
in
life
as
love
young
dream
as
she
let
the
last
bars
die
away
and
gave
cupid
a
little
caress
and
was
about
to
commence
the
neat
verse
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
played
around
the
room
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
crash
of
thunder
peg
cowered
down
into
a
deep
chair
all
the
laughter
died
from
her
face
and
the
joy
in
her
heart
she
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
knelt
down
and
prayed
to
our
lady
of
sorrows
by
this
time
the
sky
was
completely
leaden
in
hue
and
rain
was
pouring
down
again
the
darkening
room
was
lit
up
by
a
vivid
forked
flash
and
the
crash
of
the
thunder
came
instantly
the
storm
was
immediately
overhead
peg
closed
her
eyes
as
she
did
when
a
child
while
her
lips
moved
in
prayer
into
the
room
through
the
window
came
a
young
man
his
turned
up
rain
pouring
from
his
hat
inside
his
coat
was
a
dog
the
man
came
well
into
the
room
turning
down
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
shaking
the
moisture
from
his
clothes
when
he
suddenly
saw
the
kneeling
figure
of
peg
he
looked
down
at
her
in
surprise
she
was
intent
on
her
prayers
hello
cried
the
young
man
frightened
eh
peg
looked
up
and
saw
him
staring
down
at
her
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
inside
his
coat
was
her
precious
little
dog
trembling
with
fear
the
terrier
barked
loudly
when
he
saw
his
mistress
peg
sprang
up
clutched
michael
away
from
the
stranger
just
as
another
blinding
flash
played
around
the
room
followed
by
a
deafening
report
peg
ran
across
to
the
door
shouting
shut
it
out
shut
it
out
she
stood
there
trembling
covering
her
eyes
with
one
hand
with
the
other
she
held
on
to
the
overjoyed
michael
who
was
whining
with
glee
at
seeing
her
again
the
amazed
and
amused
young
man
closed
the
windows
and
the
curtains
then
he
moved
down
toward
peg
do
come
near
the
dog
sir
do
come
near
it
she
opened
a
door
and
found
it
led
into
a
little
reception
room
she
fastened
michael
with
a
piece
of
string
to
a
chair
in
the
room
and
came
back
to
look
again
at
the
stranger
who
had
evidently
rescued
her
dog
from
the
storm
he
was
a
tall
bronzed
broad
shouldered
young
man
of
about
with
a
pleasant
genial
magnetic
manner
and
a
playful
humour
lurking
in
his
eyes
as
peg
looked
him
all
over
she
found
that
he
was
smiling
down
at
her
does
the
dog
belong
to
you
he
queried
what
were
you
doin
with
him
she
asked
in
reply
i
found
him
barking
at
a
very
mare
mare
cried
peg
where
tied
to
the
the
is
that
where
they
put
once
again
the
lightning
flashed
vividly
and
the
thunder
echoed
dully
through
the
room
peg
shivered
the
stranger
reassured
her
do
be
frightened
it
only
a
summer
storm
summer
or
winter
they
shrivel
me
up
gasped
peg
the
young
man
walked
to
the
windows
and
drew
back
the
curtains
come
and
look
at
it
he
said
encouragingly
they
beautiful
in
this
part
of
the
country
come
and
watch
it
i
not
watch
it
cried
peg
shut
it
out
once
more
the
young
man
closed
the
curtains
peg
looked
at
him
and
said
in
an
voice
they
say
if
ye
look
at
the
sky
when
the
lightnin
comes
ye
can
see
the
kingdom
of
heaven
an
the
sight
of
it
blinds
some
and
kills
others
accordin
to
the
state
of
grace
ye
in
you
a
catholic
said
the
stranger
what
else
would
i
be
asked
peg
in
surprise
again
the
lightning
lit
the
room
and
after
some
seconds
came
the
deep
rolling
of
the
now
distant
thunder
peg
closed
her
eyes
again
and
shivered
does
it
seem
he
is
angry
with
us
for
our
sins
she
cried
with
me
perhaps
not
with
you
answered
the
stranger
what
do
ye
mane
by
that
asked
peg
you
do
know
what
sin
is
replied
the
young
man
and
who
may
you
be
to
talk
to
me
like
that
demanded
peg
my
name
is
jerry
said
the
stranger
jerry
and
peg
looked
at
him
curiously
yes
what
is
yours
peg
and
there
was
a
sullen
note
of
fixed
determination
in
her
tone
peg
eh
and
the
stranger
smiled
she
nodded
and
looked
at
him
curiously
what
a
strange
name
he
had
jerry
she
had
never
heard
such
a
name
before
associated
with
such
a
man
she
asked
him
again
slowly
to
make
certain
she
had
heard
aright
jerry
did
ye
say
just
plain
jerry
he
answered
cheerfully
and
you
peg
she
nodded
again
with
a
quick
little
smile
just
plain
peg
i
do
agree
with
you
said
the
young
man
i
think
you
are
very
charming
ye
must
say
things
like
that
with
the
thunder
and
outside
answered
peg
frowning
i
mean
it
from
the
man
who
called
himself
jerry
no
ye
do
mane
it
said
peg
positively
the
man
who
manes
them
things
never
sez
them
my
father
always
told
me
to
be
careful
of
the
fellow
that
sez
flattherin
things
right
to
yer
face
no
good
peg
my
father
sez
no
good
jerry
laughed
heartily
your
father
is
right
only
his
doctrine
hardly
applies
in
this
instance
i
did
mean
it
as
flattery
just
a
plain
statement
of
fact
after
a
pause
he
went
on
who
are
you
i
me
aunt
niece
replied
peg
looking
at
him
furtively
jerry
laughed
again
and
who
is
your
aunt
mrs
whom
poor
peg
tried
again
at
the
absurd
name
my
aunt
is
mrs
mrs
chichester
asked
jerry
in
surprise
that
it
said
peg
how
extraordinary
is
it
ye
would
expect
a
fine
lady
like
her
to
have
a
niece
like
me
would
ye
that
is
what
i
meant
corrected
jerry
yes
it
is
what
ye
meant
do
tell
untruths
with
the
storm
outside
replied
peg
i
was
thinking
that
i
do
remember
alaric
ever
telling
me
that
he
had
such
a
charming
cousin
oh
do
you
know
alaric
asked
peg
with
a
quick
smile
very
well
answered
jerry
peg
smile
developed
into
a
long
laugh
and
why
that
laugh
queried
jerry
i
like
me
father
to
see
alaric
i
like
him
just
to
see
alaric
for
one
minnit
indeed
yes
indade
ye
know
alaric
do
ye
is
it
funny
how
the
name
suits
him
alaric
there
are
very
few
people
a
name
like
that
would
get
along
with
but
fits
him
all
right
does
it
well
he
did
know
i
was
alive
until
i
dropped
down
from
the
clouds
this
mornin
where
did
you
drop
from
new
york
really
how
odd
not
at
all
it
nearly
as
big
as
london
and
there
nothin
odd
about
new
york
were
you
born
there
asked
jerry
i
was
answered
peg
by
way
of
old
ireland
eh
how
did
ye
guess
that
queried
peg
not
quite
certain
whether
to
be
pleased
or
angry
your
slight
but
delightful
accent
replied
jerry
accent
is
it
and
peg
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
sure
i
no
accent
i
just
speak
naturally
it
you
have
the
accent
to
my
way
of
thinkin
really
asked
the
amused
jerry
peg
imitated
the
young
polished
tone
wah
ye
bawn
theah
jerry
laughed
immoderately
who
was
this
extraordinary
little
person
was
the
one
thought
that
was
in
his
mind
how
would
you
say
it
he
asked
i
say
it
naturally
i
would
say
ye
borrn
there
i
twist
the
poor
english
language
any
worse
than
it
already
is
peg
had
enough
of
the
discussion
and
started
off
on
another
expedition
of
discovery
by
standing
on
a
chair
and
examining
some
china
in
a
cabinet
jerry
turned
up
to
the
windows
and
drew
back
the
curtains
threw
the
windows
wide
open
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
it
was
once
more
a
crystal
blue
and
the
sun
was
shining
vividly
he
called
to
peg
the
storm
is
over
the
air
is
clear
of
electricity
all
the
anger
has
gone
from
the
heavens
see
peg
said
reverently
praise
be
to
god
for
that
then
she
went
haphazardly
around
the
room
examining
everything
sitting
in
various
kinds
of
chairs
on
the
sofa
smelling
the
flowers
and
wherever
she
went
jerry
followed
her
at
a
little
distance
are
you
going
to
stay
here
he
reopened
the
conversation
with
mebbe
i
will
and
mebbe

wo

somewhat
unsatisfactory

only
child
what

your
father

peg
took
a
deep
breath
and
answered
eagerly
she
was
on
the
one
subject
about
which
she
could
talk
freely
all
she
needed
was
a
good
listener
this
strange
man
unlike
her
aunt
seemed
to
be
the
very
person
to
talk
to
on
the
one
really
vital
subject
to
peg
she
said
breathlessly
sure
me
father
can
do
anythin
at
all
except
make
money
an
when
he
does
make
it
he
ca
kape

plent
an
faith

the
happiest
that
we
have
she
only
stopped
to
take
breath
before
on
she
went
again
there
have
been
times
when
we
been
most
starvin
but
me
father
never
lost
his
pluck
or
his
spirits
nayther

i
when
times

been
the
hardest
i
never
heard
a
word
of
complaint
from
me
father
nor
seen
a
frown
on
his
face
an
he
never
used
a
harsh
word
to
me
in
me
life
sure
we
more
like
boy
and
girl
together
than
father
and
daughther
her
eyes
began
to
fill
and
her
voice
to
break
an
i
sick
for
the
sight
of
him
an
i
sure
he
is
for
me

his

she
covered
her
eyes
as
the
tears
trickled
down
through
her
fingers
under
her
breath
jerry
heard
her
saying
i
wish
i
was
back
home
so
i
do
he
was
all
compassion
in
a
moment
something
in
the
loneliness
and
staunchness
of
the
little
girl
appealed
to
him
do
do
that
he
said
softly
as
he
felt
the
moisture
start
into
his
own
eyes
peg
unpinned
her
little
handkerchief
and
carefully
wiped
away
her
tears
and
just
as
carefully
folded
the
handkerchief
up
again
and
pinned
it
back
by
her
side
i
do
cry
often
she
said
me
father
never
made
me
do
it
i
never
saw
him
cry
but
twice
in
his
life
once
when
he
made
a
little
money
and
we
had
a
mass
said
for
me
mother
soul
an
we
had
the
most
beautiful
candles
on
our
lady
altar
he
cried
then
he
did
and
when
i
left
him
to
come
here
on
the
ship
and
then
only
at
the
last
minnit
he
laughed
and
joked
with
me
all
the
time
we
were
together
but
when
the
ship
swung
away
from
the
dock
he
just
broke
down
and
cried
like
a
little
child
peg
he
kep
sayin
little
peg
i
tell
ye
i
wanted
to
jump
off
that
ship
an
go
back
to
him
but
we
started
an
i
know
how
to
swim
how
it
relieved
her
feelings
to
talk
to
some
one
about
her
father
already
she
felt
she
had
known
jerry
for
years
in
a
moment
she
went
on
again
i
cried
meself
to
sleep
that
night
i
did
an
many
a
night
too
on
that
steamer

did

purse

sow
ear
that
what
me
father
always
said
an
that
what
i
am
i
a
sow
ear
she
stopped
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
jerry
was
more
than
moved
at
this
entirely
human
and
natural
outbreak
it
was
even
as
looking
into
some
one
heart
and
brain
and
hearing
thoughts
spoken
aloud
and
seeing
the
nervous
workings
of
the
heart
when
she
described
herself
in
such
derogatory
terms
a
smile
of
relief
played
on
jerry
face
as
he
leaned
over
to
her
and
said
i
afraid
i
can
not
agree
with
you
she
looked
up
at
him
and
said
indifferently
it
does
make
the
slightest
bit
of
difference
to
me
whether
ye
do
or
not
that
what
i
am
i
a
sow
ear
he
reasoned
with
her
when
the
strangeness
wears
off
you
be
very
happy
do
yez
know
the
people
here
the
oh
yes
very
well
then
what
makes
ye
think
i
be
happy
among
them
because
you
know
that
you
pleasing
your
father
but
i
all
alone
you
among
friends
peg
shook
her
head
and
said
bitterly
no
i
not
they
may
be
me
relations
but
they
not
me
friends
they
ashamed
of
me
oh
no
interrupted
jerry
oh
yes
contradicted
peg
i
tell
ye
they
are
ashamed
of
me
they
sent
me
to
the
kitchen
when
i
first
came
here
and
now
they
put
to
slape
in
the
stable
i
want
ye
to
understand
is
not
used
to
that
he
always
sleeps
with
me
father
she
was
so
unexpected
that
jerry
found
himself
on
the
verge
of
tears
one
moment
and
the
next
something
she
would
say
some
odd
look
or
quaint
inflection
would
compel
his
laughter
again
he
had
a
mental
picture
of
michael
the
pet
of
peg
home
submitting
to
the
indignity
of
companionship
with
mere
horses
small
wonder
he
was
snapping
at
ethel
mare
when
jerry
discovered
him
he
turned
again
to
peg
and
said
when
they
really
get
to
know
you
miss
they
will
be
just
as
proud
of
you
as
your
father
is
as
i
would
be
peg
looked
at
him
in
whimsical
astonishment
you
be
why
should
you
be
proud
of
me
i
be
more
than
proud
if
you
look
on
me
as
your
friend
a
friend
is
it
cried
peg
warily
sure
i
do
know
who
you
are
at
all
and
she
drew
away
from
him
she
was
on
her
guard
peg
made
few
friends
friendship
to
her
was
not
a
thing
to
be
lightly
given
or
accepted
why
this
man
calling
himself
by
the
outlandish
name
of
jerry
should
walk
in
out
of
nowhere
and
offer
her
his
friendship
and
expect
her
to
jump
at
it
puzzled
her
it
also
irritated
her
who
was
he
jerry
explained
oh
i
can
give
you
some
very
good
references
for
instance
i
went
to
the
same
college
as
your
cousin
alaric
peg
looked
at
him
in
absolute
disdain
did
ye
she
said
well
i
mention
that
to
very
few
people
if
i
were
you
and
she
walked
away
from
him
he
followed
her
do
you
want
me
to
be
your
friend
sure
i
do
know
peg
answered
quickly
i
like
the
widdy
pig
that
was
put
into
a
rale
bed
to
sleep
it
nayther
wanted
it
nor
it
did
want
it
the
pig
had
done
without
beds
all
its
life
and
it
was
cryin
its
heart
out
for
the
loss
of
somethin
it
had
never
had
and
could
miss
jerry
laughed
heartily
at
the
evident
sincerity
of
the
analogy
peg
looked
straight
at
him
i
want
to
tell
ye
that
one
thing
in
yer
favour
she
said
what
is
asked
jerry
sure
laughter
is
not
dead
in
you
as
it
is
in
every
one
else
in
this
house
whilst
jerry
was
still
laughing
peg
suddenly
joined
in
with
him
and
giving
him
a
playful
slap
with
the
back
of
her
hand
asked
him
who
are
ye
at
all
no
one
in
particular
answered
jerry
between
gasps
i
can
see
that
said
peg
candidly
i
mean
what
do
ye
do
everything
a
little
and
nothing
really
well
jerry
replied
i
was
a
soldier
for
a
while
then
i
took
a
splash
at
doctoring
read
law
in
south
america
for
a
year
now
i
farming
farming
asked
peg
incredulously
yes
i
a
farmer
peg
laughed
as
she
looked
at
the
clothes
the
languid
manner
and
easy
poise
it
must
be
mighty
hard
on
the
land
and
cattle
to
have
you
them
she
said
it
is
and
he
too
laughed
again
they
resent
my
methods
i
a
new
farmer
faith
ye
must
be
to
sum
up
my
career
i
can
do
a
whole
lot
of
things
fairly
well
and
none
of
them
well
enough
to
brag
about
just
like
me
father
she
said
interestedly
you
flatter
me
he
replied
courteously
peg
thought
she
detected
a
note
of
sarcasm
she
turned
on
him
fiercely
i
know
i
do
there
is
a
man
in
the
whole
wurrld
like
me
father
not
a
man
in
the
wurrld
but
he
says
he
a
rollin
stone
and
they
amount
to
much
in
a
wurrld
that
all
for
makin
dollars
your
father
is
right
agreed
jerry
money
is
the
standard
and
we
all
valued
by
it
and
he
got
none
cried
peg
thoughts
were
coming
thick
and
fast
through
her
little
brain
to
speak
of
her
father
was
to
want
to
be
near
him
and
she
wanted
him
there
now
for
that
polished
gentleman
to
see
what
a
wonderful
man
he
was
she
suddenly
said
well
he
got
me
i
had
enough
of
this
place
i
goin
home
now
she
started
up
the
staircase
leading
to
the
mauve
room
jerry
called
after
her
anxiously
no
no
miss
do
go
like
that
i
must
said
peg
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
what
will
i
get
here
but
to
be
laughed
at
and
jeered
at
by
a
lot
of
people
that
are
not
fit
to
even
look
at
me
father
who
are
they
i
like
to
know
that
i
speak
his
name
in
their
presence
i
love
me
father
and
sure
it
easier
to
suffer
for
the
want
of
food
than
the
want
of
love
suddenly
she
raised
one
hand
above
her
head
and
in
the
manner
and
tone
of
a
she
astounded
jerry
with
the
following
outburst
an
that
what
the
irish
are
doin
all
over
the
wurrld
driven
out
of
their
own
country
by
the
english
and
become
wandherers
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
nothin
they
ever
earn
make
up
to
them
for
the
separation
from
their
homes
and
their
loved
ones
she
finished
the
peroration
on
a
high
note
and
with
a
forced
manner
such
as
she
had
frequently
heard
on
the
platform
she
smiled
at
the
astonished
jerry
and
asked
him
do
ye
know
what
that
is
i
have
the
least
idea
he
answered
truthfully
that
out
of
one
of
me
father
speeches

the
cause
of

them

no
more
throuble

she
warmed
to
her
subject
she
was
on
her
and
she
would
ride
it
as
far
as
this
quiet
stranger
would
let
her

went
on
again

she
asked
jerry
suddenly
in
case
she
was
tiring
him
although
how
any
one
could
be
tired
listening
to
the
description
of
her
hero
she
could
not
imagine
jerry
hastened
to
assure
her
that
he
was
really
most
interested
i
am
not
botherin

i
not
in
the
least
jerry
assured
her
again
well
so
long
as

i
tell

some
more
ye

i
went
all
through
ireland
when
i
was
a
child
with
me
father
in
a
cart
the
police
and
the
constabulary
used
to
follow

about

were
very
frightened
of
me
father
they
were
they
were
grand
days
for
me
ye

he
used
to
thry
his
speeches
on
me
first
then
i
listen
to
him

but
it
is
not
the
same
hearin

that
it
is
hearin
me
father
ye
got
to
see
the
flash
of
his
eye
hear
the
big
sob
in
his
voice
when
he
spakes
of
his
counthry
to
ralely
get
the
full
power
o
them
i
do
me
best
for

of
course
ye
english
mebbe
she
asked
him
suddenly
i
am
said
jerry
he
almost
felt
inclined
to
apologise
well
sure
that
not
your
fault
ye
could
help
it
no
one
should
hold
that
against
ye
we
ca
all

born
irish
i
glad
you
look
at
it
so
said
jerry
do
ye
know
much
about
ireland
asked
peg
very
little
i
ashamed
to
say
answered
jerry
well
it
would
be
worth
yer
while
to
learn
somethin
about
it
said
peg
i
make
it
my
business
to
he
assured
her
it
god
country
is
ireland
and
it
many
a
tear
he
must
have
shed
at
the
way
england
mismanages
it
but
he
is
very
lenient
and
patient
with
the
english
they
so
slow
to
take
notice
of
how
things
really
are
and
some
day
he
will
punish
them
and
it
will
be
through
the
irish
that
punishment
will
be
meted
out
to
them
she
had
unconsciously
dropped
again
into
her
father
method
of
oratory
climaxing
the
speech
with
all
the
vigour
of
the
rising
inflection
she
looked
at
jerry
her
face
aglow
with
enthusiasm
that
from
another
of
me
father
speeches
did
ye
notice
the
way
he
ended
it
the
irish
that
punishment
will
be
meted
out
to
them
i
think
out
is
grand
i
tell
you
me
father
has
the
most
wondherful
command
of
language
she
stood
restlessly
a
moment
her
hands
beating
each
other
alternately
i
get
so
lonesome
for
him
she
said
suddenly
with
a
tone
of
definite
resolve
in
her
voice
she
started
up
the
stairs
calling
over
her
shoulder
i
goin
back
to
him
now
and
she
ran
all
the
way
upstairs
jerry
followed
her
pleading
insistently
wait
please
wait
she
stopped
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
looked
down
at
him
give
us
one
month
trial
one
month
he
urged
it
will
be
very
little
out
of
your
life
and
i
promise
you
your
father
will
not
suffer
through
it
except
in
losing
you
for
that
one
little
month
will
you
just
a
month
he
spoke
so
earnestly
and
seemed
so
sincerely
pained
and
so
really
concerned
going
that
she
came
down
a
few
steps
and
looked
at
him
irresolutely
why
do
you
want
me
to
stay
she
asked
him
because
because
your
late
uncle
was
my
friend
it
was
his
last
wish
to
do
something
for
you
will
you
just
a
month
she
struggled
with
the
desire
to
go
away
from
all
that
was
so
foreign
and
distasteful
to
her
then
she
looked
at
jerry
and
realised
with
something
akin
to
a
feeling
of
pleasure
that
he
was
pleading
with
her
to
stay
and
doing
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
that
it
mattered
to
him
she
had
to
admit
to
herself
that
she
rather
liked
the
look
of
him
he
seemed
honest
and
even
though
he
were
english
he
did
show
an
interest
whenever
she
spoke
of
her
father
and
he
had
promised
to
try
and
learn
something
about
ireland
that
certainly
was
in
his
favour
just
as
the
fact
that
he
could
laugh
was
too
quickly
the
thoughts
ran
through
peg
brain
after
all
to
run
away
now
would
look
cowardly
her
father
would
be
ashamed
of
her
this
family
would
laugh
at
her
that
thought
was
too
much
the
very
suggestion
of
alaric
laughing
at
her
caused
a
sudden
rush
of
blood
to
her
head
her
temples
throbbed
instantly
she
made
up
her
mind
she
would
stay
turning
to
jerry
she
said
all
right
then
stay
a
month
but
not
any
more
than
a
month
though
not
unless
you
wish
it
i
wo

it
i
promise

month

this
house

to
seem
like

jerry
smiling
ye

to

corrected
her
hastily
i
am
glad

to
stay
well
that
a
comfort
anyway
some
one
be
pleased
at
me
stayin
and
she
came
down
the
stairs
and
walked
over
to
the
piano
again
jerry
followed
her
i
am
immensely
all
right
ye
said
it
replied
peg
looking
up
and
finding
him
standing
beside
her
she
moved
away
from
him
again
he
followed
her
and
will
you
look
on
me
as
your
friend
this
time
she
turned
away
abruptly
she
did
not
like
being
followed
about
by
a
man
she
had
only
just
met
there
time
enough
for
that
she
said
and
went
across
to
the
windows
is
it
so
hard
pleaded
jerry
again
following
i
do
know
whether
it
hard
or
aisy
until
i
thry
it
then
try
urged
jerry
going
quite
close
to
her
she
faced
him
i
never
had
anyone
makin
such
a
fuss
about
havin
me
for
a
friend
before
i
do
understand
you

all
yet

simple
said
jerry
i
do
doubt
ye
peg
answered
drily
from
what
i
heard
of
them
most
of
the
english
are
simple
he
laughed
and
held
out
his
hand
what
that
for
she
asked
suspiciously
to
our
friendship
i
never
saw
the
likes
of
you
in
all
me
life
come
peg
i
do
think
it
necessary
come
she
looked
into
his
eyes
they
were
fixed
upon
her
without
quite
knowing
why
she
found
herself
giving
him
her
hand
he
grasped
it
firmly
friends

yet
now
she
answered
half
defiantly
half
frightenedly
i

stake
my
life

very
happy
amongst

peg
a
door
slammed
loudly
in
the
distance
peg
distinctly
heard
her
voice
and
alaric
in
a
moment
she
became
she
made
one
bound
for
the
stairs
and
sprang
up
them
three
at
a
time
at
the
top
she
turned
and
warned
him
do
tell
any
one
ye
saw
me
i
wo
promised
the
astonished
young
man
but
their
secret
was
to
be
as
peg
turned
ethel
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
as
she
descended
glaring
at
peg
the
unfortunate
girl
went
down
backwards
before
her
at
the
same
moment
chichester
and
alaric
came
in
through
the
door
they
all
greeted
jerry
warmly

particularly
gracious

jerry
heartily
he
slipped
his
arm
through
alaric
and
led
him
up
to
the
windows
why
al
your
cousin

adorable
he
said
enthusiastically
what
alaric
gasped
in
horror

the
most
delightful
time
together
i

alaric
cautiously

distance
alaric
hurried
to
the
door

cried
jerry
joining
him
i
starving
peg
came
quietly
from
behind
the
newell
post
where
she
had
been
practically
hidden
and
went
straight
to
jerry
and
smiling
up
at
him
her
eyes
dancing
with
amusement
said
so

indignantly
at

what
alaric

struck
dumb

back
upon
well
i

that
young
gentleman
slipping

arm
through
his
own
turning
to
chichester
he
asked
her
with
your
permission

will
lead
the
way
come
peg
and
he
led
her
to
the
door
and
opened
it
peg
looked
up
at
him
a
roguish
light
dancing
in
her
big
expressive
eyes
thanks

wager
of

life

she
put
one
hand
gently
on
her
little
stomach
and
cried
i
am
so
hungry
me
soul
is
hangin
by
a
thread
laughing
gaily
the
two
friends
went
in
search
of
the
the
chichester
family
looked
at
each
other
it
seemed
that
the
fatal
first
day
of
june
was
to
be
a
day
of
shocks
disgraceful
ventured
ethel
awful
said
the
stunned
alaric
she
must
be
taken
in
hand
and
at
once
came
in
firm
tones
from
chichester
she
must
never
be
left
alone
again
come
quickly
before
she
can
disgrace
us
any
further
the
unfortunate
family
following
in
the
wake
of
peg
and
jerry
found
them
in
the
chattering
together
like
old
friends
he
was
endeavouring
to
persuade
peg
to
try
an
olive
she
yielded
just
as
the
family
arrived
she
withdrew
the
olive
in
great
haste
and
turning
to
jerry
said
faith
there
nothin
good
about
it
but
it
colour
in
a
few
moments
she
sat
down
to
the
first
formal
meal
is
the
bosom
of
the
chichester
family
chapter
vii
the
passing
of
the
first
month
the
days
that
followed
were
ones
for
peg
her
nature
was
in
continual
revolt
the
teaching
of
her
whole
lifetime
she
was
told
to
correct
everything
she
said
everything
she
looked
everything
she
did
was
wrong
tutors
were
engaged
to
prepare
her
for
the
position
she
might
one
day
enjoy
through
her
dead
uncle
will
they
did
not
remain
long
she
showed
either
marked
incapacity
to
acquire
the
slightest
veneer
of
culture
else
it
was
pure
wilfulness
the
only
gleams
of
relief
she
had
were
on
the
occasions
when
jerry
visited
the
family
whenever
they
could
avoid
watchful
eyes
they
would
chat
and
laugh
and
play
like
children
she
could
not
understand
him
he
was
always
discovering
new
traits
in
her
they
became
great
friends
her
letters
to
her
father
were
at
first
very
bitter
regarding
her
treatment
by
the
family
indeed
so
resentful
did
they
become
that
her
father
wrote
to
her
in
reply
urging
her
if
she
was
so
unhappy
to
at
once
return
to
him
on
the
next
steamer
but
she
did
not
little
by
little
the
letters
softened
occasionally
toward
the
end
of
that
first
month
they
seemed
almost
contented
her
father
marvelled
at
the
cause
the
month
she
had
promised
to
stay
was
drawing
to
an
end
but
one
more
day
remained
it
was
to
be
a
memorable
one
for
peg
jerry
had
endeavoured
at
various
times
to
encourage
her
to
study
he
would
question
her
and
chide
her
and
try
to
stimulate
her
one
day
he
gave
her
a
large
volume
and
asked
her
to
read
it
at
odd
times
and
he
would
examine
her
in
it
when
she
had
mastered
its
contents
she
opened
it
wonderingly
and
found
it
to
be
love
stories
of
the
world
it
became
peg
treasure
she
kept
it
hidden
from
every
one
in
the
house
she
made
a
cover
for
it
out
of
a
piece
of
cloth
so
that
no
one
could
see
the
ornate
binding
she
would
read
it
at
night
in
her
room
by
day
out
in
the
fields
or
by
the
sea
but
her
favourite
time
and
place
was
in
the
every
evening
after
dinner
she
would
surround
herself
with
books
a
geography
a
history
of
england
a
huge
atlas
a
treatise
on
simple
arithmetic
and
put
the
great
book
in
the
centre
making
of
it
an
island
the
fount
of
knowledge
then
she
would
devour
it
intently
until
some
one
disturbed
her
the
moment
she
heard
anyone
coming
she
would
cover
it
up
quickly
with
the
other
books
and
pretend
to
be
studying
the
book
was
a
revelation
to
her
it
gave
all
her
imagination
full
play
through
its
pages
treaded
a
stately
procession
of
kings
and
queens
wagnerian
heroes
and
heroines
shakespearian
creations
melodious
in
verse
and
countless
others
it
was
indeed
a
it
took
her
back
to
the
lives
and
loves
of
the
illustrious
and
passionate
dead
and
it
brought
her
for
the
first
time
to
the
great
fount
of
poetry
and
genius
life
began
to
take
on
a
different
aspect
to
her
all
her
rebellious
spirit
would
soften
under
the
spell
of
her
imagination
and
again
all
her
dauntless
spirit
would
assert
itself
under
the
petty
humiliations
the
chichester
family
frequently
inflicted
upon
her
next
to
chichester
she
saw
alaric
the
most
although
she
could
not
actively
dislike
the
little
man
her
first
feeling
of
amusement
wore
off
he
simply
bored
her
now
he
was
no
longer
funny
he
seemed
of
so
little
account
in
the
world
she
saw
but
little
of
ethel
they
hardly
spoke
when
they
met
all
through
the
month
christian
brent
was
a
frequent
visitor
if
peg
only
despised
the
chichesters
she
positively
loathed
brent
and
with
a
loathing
she
took
no
pains
to
conceal
on
his
part
brent
would
openly
and
covertly
show
his
admiration
for
her
peg
was
waiting
for
a
really
good
chance
to
find
out
real
character
the
opportunity
came
on
the
night
of
the
last
day
of
the
peg
was
in
her
favourite
position
lying
face
downward
on
a
sofa
reading
her
treasure
when
she
became
conscious
of
dome
one
being
in
the
room
watching
her
she
started
up
in
a
panic
instinctively
hiding
the
book
behind
her
she
found
brent
staring
down
at
her
in
open
admiration
something
in
the
intentness
of
his
gaze
caused
her
to
spring
to
her
feet
he
smiled
a
sickly
smile
the
book
must
be
absorbing
what
is
it
he
asked
peg
faced
him
the
book
clasped
in
both
of
her
hands
behind
her
back
her
eyes
flashing
and
her
heart
throbbing
brent
looked
at
her
with
marked
appreciation
you
must
be
angry
child
what
is
it
eh
something
forbidden
and
he
leered
knowingly
at
her
then
he
made
a
quick
snatch
at
the
book
saying
show
it
me
peg
ran
across
the
room
and
turning
up
a
corner
of
the
carpet
put
the
book
under
it
turned
back
the
carpet
put
her
foot
determinedly
on
it
and
turned
again
to
face
her
tormentor
brent
went
rapidly
across
to
her
the
instinct
of
the
chase
was
quick
in
his
blood
a
eh
now
you
make
me
really
curious
let
me
see
he
again
made
a
movement
toward
the
hidden
book
peg
clenched
both
of
her
hands
into
little
fists
and
glared
at
brent
while
her
breath
came
in
quick
sharp
gasps
she
was
prepared
to
defend
the
identity
of
the
book
at
any
cost
i
love
spirit
cried
brent
then
he
looked
at
her
charming
dress
at
her
stylish
coiffure
at
the
simple
spray
of
flowers
at
her
breast
he
gave
an
ejaculation
of
pleasure
what
a
wonderful
change
in
a
month
you
most
certainly
would
not
be
sent
to
the
kitchen
now
do
you
know
you
have
grown
into
a
most
attractive
young
lady
you
are
really
delightful
angry
and
you
are
angry
are
you
and
with
me
eh
i
so
sorry
if
i
offended
you
let
us
kiss
and
be
friends
he
made
an
impulsive
movement
toward
her
and
tried
to
take
her
in
his
arms
peg
gave
him
a
resounding
box
on
the
ear
with
a
muffled
ejaculation
of
anger
and
of
pain
he
attempted
to
seize
her
by
the
wrists
when
the
door
opened
and
ethel
came
into
the
room
peg
panting
with
fury
glared
at
them
both
for
a
moment
and
then
hurried
out
through
the
windows
brent
gaining
complete
control
of
himself
turned
to
ethel
and
advancing
with
outstretched
hands
murmured
my
dear
ethel
looked
coldly
at
him
ignored
the
extended
hands
and
asked
why
did
she
run
away
brent
smiled
easily
and
confidently
i
surprised
one
of
her
secrets
and
she
flew
into
a
temper
did
you
see
her
strike
me
he
waited
anxiously
for
her
reply
secrets
was
all
ethel
said
yes
see
he
walked
across
to
the
corner
and
turned
back
the
carpet
and
kneeling
down
searched
for
the
book
found
it
and
held
it
up
triumphantly
here
he
stood
up
and
opened
the
book
and
read
the
stories
o
f
the
world
peg
from
jerry
oho
cried
brent
jerry
eh
no
wonder
she
did
want
me
to
see
it
he
put
the
book
back
into
its
and
advanced
to
ethel
jerry
so
that
how
the
land
lies
romantic
little
child
ethel
looked
steadily
at
him
as
he
came
toward
her
something
in
her
look
stopped
him
within
a
few
feet
of
her
why
do
you
go
after
her
and
she
nodded
in
the
direction
peg
had
gone
ethel
he
cried
aghast
she
is
new
and
has
all
the
virtues
i
assure
you
he
began
you
need
if
there
is
one
thing
i
am
convinced
of
it
your
assurance
really
ethel
were
you
away
again
she
sneered
do
you
think
for
one
moment
he
stopped
yes
i
do
answered
ethel
positively
brent
hunted
through
his
mind
for
an
explanation
finally
he
said
helplessly
i
i
do
know
what
to
say
then
you
better
say
nothing
surely
you
not
jealous
of
a
a
child
no
i
do
think
it
jealousy
said
ethel
slowly
then
what
is
it
he
asked
eagerly
she
looked
scornfully
at
him
disgust
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
contemptuously
as
he
tried
in
vain
to
find
something
to
say
then
she
went
on
now
i
understand
why
the
scullery
is
sometimes
the
rival
of
the
the
love
of
change
he
turned
away
from
her
he
was
hurt
cut
to
the
quick
this
is
not
worthy
of
you
was
all
he
said
that
is
what
rankles
replied
ethel
it
is
you
not
ethel
he
cried
desperately
if
that
ever
happened
again
i
should
have
to
amputate
you
brent
walked
over
to
the
where
he
had
left
his
automobile
coat
and
cap
and
picked
them
up
ethel
watched
him
quietly
chris
come
here
he
turned
to
her
there
it
over
i
suppose
i
have
been
a
little
hard
on
you
all
forgotten
she
held
out
her
hand
he
bent
over
it
my
nerves
have
been
rather
severely
tried
this
past
month
ethel
went
on
put
a
mongrel
into
a
kennel
of
thoroughbreds
and
they
will
either
destroy
the
intruder
or
be
in
a
continual
condition
of
unsettled
irritated
intolerance
that
is
exactly
my
condition
i
unsettled
irritable
and
intolerant
brent
sat
beside
her
and
said
softly
then
i
come
in
time
ethel
smiled
as
she
looked
right
through
him
so
did
i
did
i
and
she
indicated
the
window
through
which
peg
ran
after
assaulting
brent
the
young
man
sprang
up
reproachfully
do
please
do
he
pleaded
very
well
replied
ethel
complacently
i
wo
brent
was
standing
head
down
his
manner
was
crestfallen
he
looked
the
realisation
of
misery
and
i
sorry
chris
remarked
ethel
finally
after
some
moments
had
passed
a
month
ago
it
would
have
mattered
so
much
just
now
it
does
i
rather
looked
forward
to
seeing
you
it
been
horrible
here
a
month
of
misery
for
me
too
replied
brent
passionately
i
going
away
out
of
it
he
added
are
you
she
asked
languidly
where
petersburg
moscow
siberia
oh
the
cold
places
she
paused
then
asked
going
alone
he
knelt
on
the
sofa
she
was
sitting
on
and
whispered
almost
into
her
ear
unless
someone
goes
with
me
naturally
replied
ethel
quite
unmoved
will
you
go
and
he
waited
breathlessly
she
thought
a
moment
looked
at
him
again
and
said
quietly
chris
i
wish
i
been
here
when
you
called
instead
of
that
brat
he
turned
away
up
again
to
the
crying
oh
this
is
unbearable
ethel
said
quite
calmly
is
it
your
wife
all
over
again
eh
he
came
back
to
her
no
i
place
you
far
above
her
far
above
all
petty
suspicions
and
carping
narrownesses
i
value
you
as
a
woman
of
understanding
i
am
she
said
frankly
from
what
you
told
me
of
your
wife
she
must
be
too
do
treat
me
like
this
he
pleaded
distractedly
what
shall
i
do
asked
ethel
with
wide
open
eyes
apologise
that
odd
i
been
waiting
for
you
to
brent
turned
away
again
with
an
impatient
ejaculation
as
he
moved
up
toward
the
windows
alaric
came
in
behind
him
through
the
door
hello
brent
he
called
out
heartily
ye
very
well
thank
you
alaric
he
said
controlling
his
surprise
good
the
dear
wife
well
too
very
and
the
sweet
child
yes
you
must
bring
along
sometime
the
mater
would
love
to
see
them
and
so
would
ethel
ethel
loves
babies
do
you
dear
without
waiting
for
ethel
to
reply
he
hurried
on
and
talkin
of
babies
have
you
seen
margaret
anywhere
ethel
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
out
there
splendid
the
mater
wants
her
we
got
to
have
a
family
about
her
and
at
once
mater
be
here
in
a
minute
do
run
away
brent
and
alaric
hurried
out
through
the
windows
into
the
garden
brent
hurried
over
to
ethel
i
at
the
hotel
i
be
there
until
morning
send
me
a
message
will
you
i
wait
up
all
night
for
one
he
paused
will
you
perhaps
replied
ethel
i
sorry
if
anything
i
said
or
done
has
hurt
you
believe
me
it
is
absolutely
and
entirely
unnecessary
do
say
any
more
oh
if
only
he
made
an
impulsive
movement
toward
her
she
checked
him
just
as
her
mother
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
at
the
same
moment
bennett
the
maid
came
in
through
the
door
chichester
greeted
brent
courteously
how
do
you
do
brent
you
will
excuse
me
she
turned
to
the
maid
when
did
you
see
my
niece
last
not
this
hour
madam
tell
jarvis
to
search
the
gardens
the
stables
to
look
up
and
down
the
road
yes
madam
and
the
maid
hurried
away
in
search
of
jarvis
chichester
turned
again
to
her
guest
pardon
me
mr
brent
i
just
leaving
mrs
chichester
oh
but
you
need
expostulated
that
lady
i
going
abroad
i
just
called
to
say
indeed
said
chichester
well
i
hope
you
and
brent
have
a
very
pleasant
trip
you
must
both
call
the
moment
you
return
thank
you
replied
brent
chichester
and
ethel
he
looked
meaningly
and
significantly
at
ethel
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
the
next
moment
he
was
gone
ethel
was
facing
the
problem
of
her
future
with
no
one
to
turn
to
and
ask
for
guidance
her
mother
least
of
all
chichester
had
never
encouraged
confidence
between
her
children
and
herself
consequently
any
crisis
they
reached
they
had
to
either
decide
for
themselves
or
appeal
to
others
ethel
had
to
decide
for
herself
between
now
and
morning
next
day
it
would
be
too
late
what
was
she
to
do
always
loath
to
make
up
her
mind
until
forced
to
she
decided
to
wait
until
night
it
might
be
that
the
something
she
was
always
expecting
to
snap
in
her
nature
would
do
so
that
evening
and
save
her
the
supreme
effort
of
taking
the
final
step
on
her
own
initiative
and
consequently
having
to
bear
the
full
responsibility
whilst
these
thoughts
were
passing
rapidly
through
her
mind
alaric
hurried
in
through
the
windows
from
the
garden
not
a
sign
of
margaret
anywhere
he
said
furiously
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
and
fanning
himself
vigorously
this
can
not
go
on
cried
chichester
i
should
think
not
indeed
running
about
all
over
the
place
chichester
held
up
an
open
telegram
hawkes
telegraphs
he
will
call
for
his
first
report
what
can
i
tell
him
what
will
you
asked
alaric
am
i
to
tell
him
that
every
tutor
i
engaged
for
her
resigned
not
one
stays
more
than
a
week
can
i
tell
him
that
you
could
mater
dear
but
would
it
be
wise
chichester
went
on
am
i
to
tell
him
that
no
maid
will
stay
with
her
that
she
shows
no
desire
to
improve
that
she
mimics
and
angers
her
teachers
refuses
to
study
and
plays
impish
tricks
like
some
mischievous
little
elf
am
i
to
tell
him
that
serve
her
jolly
well
right
if
you
did
eh
ethel
said
alaric
it
would
replied
ethel
at
that
moment
the
footman
and
the
maid
both
entered
from
the
garden
very
much
out
of
breath
i
searched
everywhere
madam
not
a
sign
of
her
said
bennett
not
in
the
stables
nor
up
or
down
the
road
and
the
dog
missin
madam
added
jarvis
ethel
sprang
up
no
miss
she
gnawin
a
bone
on
the
lawn
the
other
that
will
do
and
chichester
dismissed
them
as
they
disappeared
through
the
door
the
old
lady
said
appealingly
to
her
children
where
is
she
heaven
knows
said
alaric
oh
if
i
could
only
throw
the
whole
business
up
wish
to
goodness
we
could
but
the
monthly
cheque
will
be
useful
mater
that
it
that
it
cried
the
unhappy
woman
no
one
seems
particularly
anxious
to
snatch
at
my
services
as
yet
said
alaric
course
it
a
dull
time
jerry
tells
me
but
there
we
are
not
tuppence
comin
in
and
the
butcher
to
be
paid
likewise
the
other
see
where
i
comin
have
i
not
lain
awake
at
night
struggling
with
it
replied
the
poor
lady
almost
on
the
verge
of
tears
well
i
tell
you
what
said
the
hope
of
the
family
i
tell
you
what
we
do
let
give
the
little
beggar
another
month
of
it
let
her
off
lightly
this
time
and
the
moment
the
gone
read
her
the
pull
her
up
with
a
jerk
ride
her
on
the
curb
and
no
rot
we
could
try
and
chichester
wiped
her
eyes
of
course
she
has
improved
in
her
manner
for
that
we
have
to
thank
ethel
she
looked
affectionately
at
her
daughter
and
choked
back
a
sob
who
could
live
near
dear
ethel
and
not
improve
ah
there
we
have
it
agreed
alaric
but
i
do
know
how
much
of
the
improvement
is
genuine
and
how
much
pretended
gasped
his
mother
there
we
go
again
she
got
us
fairly
gravelled
said
alaric
despondently
of
course
i
can
truthfully
tell
him
that
at
times
she
is
very
tractable
and
obedient
at
times
about
two
minutes
a
week
when
jerry
around
how
on
earth
he
puts
up
with
her
i
ca
understand
she
follows
him
about
like
a
little
dog
listens
to
him
behaves
herself
but
the
moment
gone
poof
back
she
goes
to
her
old
tricks
i
tell
you
she
a
freak
and
alaric
dismissed
the
matter
and
sat
back
fanning
himself
can
i
tell
hawkes
that
asked
chichester
no
replied
alaric
but
i
would
say
that
the
thousand
a
year
is
very
hardly
earned
nat
ought
to
have
made
it
ten
thousand
dirt
cheap
at
that
tell
him
that
out
of
respect
for
the
dead
man
wishes
we
shall
continue
the
job
and
that
on
the
whole
we
have
hopes
slight
but
hopes
in
through
the
open
windows
came
the
sound
of
dogs
barking
furiously
ethel
sprang
up
crying
and
hurried
out
into
the
garden
chichester
and
alaric
went
to
the
windows
and
looked
out
margaret
cried
chichester
and
the
mongrel
she
urgin
him
on
the
terrier
got
now
alaric
called
out
to
the
little
poodle
fight
him
old
girl
maul
him
woa
there
down
there
is
ethel
on
the
scene
he
cried
as
ethel
ran
across
the
lawn
and
picked
up
the
badly
treated
poodle
go
and
separate
them
urged
chichester
not
me
replied
alaric
ethel
can
handle
i
hate
the
little
brutes
all
hair
and
teeth
i
can
not
understand
women
coddling
those
little
messes
of
snarling
smelly
wool
ethel
came
indignantly
into
the
room
soothing
the
excited
and
ruffled
pet
she
was
flushed
and
very
angry
how
dare
that
brat
let
her
mongrel
touch
the
aristocratic
poodle
a
moment
later
peg
entered
with
the
victorious
michael
cradled
in
her
arms
she
had
a
roguish
look
of
triumph
in
her
eyes
down
the
front
of
her
charming
new
dress
were
the
marks
of
michael
muddy
paws
peg
was
also
breathing
quickly
and
evidently
more
than
a
little
excited
take
that
animal
out
of
the
room
cried
chichester
indignantly
the
moment
peg
appeared
peg
turned
and
walked
straight
out
into
the
garden
and
began
playing
with
michael
on
the
grass
chichester
waited
for
a
few
moments
then
called
out
to
her
margaret
then
more
sharply
margaret

on

with

commanded
her
aunt
peg
tied
michael
to
one
of
the
french
windows
and

slowly
into
the
room
and
stood
facing

the
old
lady
looked
so
hurt
as
well
as
so
angry
that
peg
softened
and
hastened
to
try
and
make
it
up
with
her
aunt
sure

chichester
i

at

suddenly
cried
chichester
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
marks
of
michael
playfulness
peg
looked
at
the
stains
demurely
and
said
cheerfully
did
that
sure
they
come
off
chichester
looked
at
the
flushed
face
of
the
young
girl
at
the
mass
of
curly
hair
that
had
been
carefully
dressed
by
bennett
for
dinner
and
was
now
hovering
around
her
eyes
untidily
the
old
lady
straightened
it
can
you
not
keep
your
hair
out
of
your
eyes
what
do
you
think
will
become
of
you
i
hope
to
go
to
heaven
like
all
good
catholics
said
peg
chichester
turned
away
with
a
gesture
of
despair
i
give
it
up
i
give
it
up
she
said
i
should
say
so
agreed
alaric
such
rubbish
peg
shook
her
head
the
moment
chichester
turned
her
back
and
the
little
red
curls
once
more
danced
in
front
of
her
eyes
i
do
everything
i
can
everything
complained
chichester
but
you
you
she
broke
off
i
do
understand
you
i
do
understand
you
me
father
always
said
that
cried
peg
eagerly
and
if
he
sure
how
could
any
one
else
never
mind
your
father
said
chichester
severely
peg
turned
away
what
is
it
continued
the
old
lady
i
say
what
is
it
what
is
what
asked
peg
is
it
that
you
do
wish
to
improve
is
it
that
i
tell
ye
what
i
think
it
is
began
peg
helpfully
as
if
anxious
to
reach
some
satisfactory
explanation
i
think
there
a
little
divil
in
me
lyin
there
and
every
now
and
again
he
jumps
out
a
devil
cried
chichester
horrified
yes
aunt
said
peg
demurely
how
dare
you
use
such
a
word
to
me
i
did
i
used
it
about
meself
i
do
know
whether
you
have
a
divil
in
ye
or
not
i
think
i
have
chichester
silenced
her
with
a
gesture
i
am
to
give
hawkes
my
first
report
on
you
peg
laughed
suddenly
and
then
checked
herself
quickly
and
why
did
you
do
that
asked
her
aunt
severely
i
had
a
picture
of
what
ye
goin
to
tell
him
your
manners
are
abominable
yes
aunt
what
am
i
to
tell
mr
hawkes
tell
him
the
truth
aunt
and
shame
the
divil
margaret
and
the
old
lady
glared
at
her
in
horror
i
beg
yer
pardon
said
peg
meekly
do
you
wish
to
remain
here
continued
chichester
sometimes
i
do
an
sometimes
i
do
do
i
do
everything
that
is
possible
for
you
yes
ye
do
everything
possible
to
me
what
i
mean
for
me
i
should
have
said
for
me
aunt
and
peg
blue
eyes
twinkled
mischievously
then
why
do
you
constantly
disobey
me
pursued
the
old
lady
i
suppose
it
is
the
original
sin
in
me
replied
peg
thoughtfully
what
cried
chichester
again
taken
completely
aback
oh
i
say
you
know
that
good
ha
and
alaric
laughed
heartily
peg
joined
in
and
laughed
heartily
with
him
alaric
immediately
stopped
ethel
took
absolutely
no
notice
of
any
one
peg
sat
down
beside
her
aunt
and
explained
to
her
whenever
i
did
anythin
wilful
or
disturbin
as
a
child
me
father
always
said
it
was
the
sin
in
me
an
that
i
was
to
be
punished
for
it
because
i
could
help
it
then
he
used
to
punish
himself
for
my
fault
an
when
i
saw
it
hurt
him
i
use
to
do
it
again
for
a
while
at
least
i
think
that
was
a
grand
way
to
bring
up
a
daughter
i
been
wonderin
since
i
been
here
if
an
aunt
could
bring
a
niece
up
the
same
way
and
she
looked
quizzically
at
chichester
supposin
for
instance
you
were
to
punish
yerself
for
wrong
that
i
do
i
might
be
so
sorry
i
never
do
it
again
but
of
course
i
might
not
i
am
not
sure
about
meself
i
think
me
father
knows
me
betther
than
i
do
meself
your
father
must
have
been
a
very
bad
influence
on
you
said
chichester
sternly
no
he
was
contradicted
peg
hotly
me
father
the
best
man
chichester
interrupted
her
margaret
peg
looked
down
sullenly
and
said
well
he
was
have
i
told
you
never
to
contradict
me
well
you
contradict
me
all
the
time
stop
well
there
nothin
fair
about
your
conthradictin
me
and
me
not
being
able
to
will
you
stop
well
now
aunt
ye
will
do
me
a
favour
if
you
will
stop
spakin
about
me
father
the
way
you
do
it
hurts
me
it
does
i
love
my
father
and
i
i
will
you
stop
i
have
stopped
and
peg
sank
back
in
her
chair
breathing
hard
and
her
little
fists
punching
against
each
other
her
aunt
then
made
the
following
proposition
if
i

full
of
curiosity
to
show
that

promise

for
a
while
what

asked
peg
all
eagerness
to
begin
something

books
said
her
aunt
sure
an
i
will
and
peg
turned
to
different
parts
of
the
room
finding
an
atlas
here
a
book
of
literature
on
the
piano
an
english
history
under
the
table
finally
she
got
them
complete
and
sat
down
at
the
big
table
and
prepared
to
study
jarvis
came
in
with
a
letter
on
a
salver
well
asked
the
old
lady
for
miss
chichester
madam
and
he
handed
ethel
the
letter
by
hand
miss
ethel
took
the
letter
quite
unconsciously
and
opened
it
whilst
she
was
reading
it
peg
called
the
footman
over
to
her
jarvis
she
said
me
dog
is
outside
there
tied
up
to
the
door
he
had
a
fight
an
he
tired
will
ye
put
him
to
bed
for
me
like
a
good
boy
jarvis
went
out
disgustedly
untied
the
dog
and
put
him
in
the
kennel
that
had
been
specially
made
for
him
poor
jarvis
life
this
last
month
had
been
most
unhappy
the
smooth
and
peaceful
order
of
things
in
the
house
had
departed
the
coming
of
the
niece
had
disturbed
everything
many
were
the
comments
below
stairs
on
the
intruder
the
following
is
an
example
of
the
manner
in
which
peg
was
regarded
by
the
footman
and
chichester
own
maid
bennett
a
niece
cried
bennett
sarcastically
just
after
peg
arrival
so
they
say
retorted
jarvis
mysteriously
what
do
you
make
of
her
well
every
family
i
served
and
my
mother
before
me
had
a
family
skeleton
she
is
ours
why
she
had
a
rag
to
her
back
when
she
came
here
i
be
ashamed
to
be
dressed
as
she
was
you
should
have
seen
the
one
she
goes
to
mass
in
i
did
said
jarvis
indignantly
all
wrapped
up
in
the
times
then
i
got
ragged
for
putting
her
in
the
kitchen
looked
too
good
for
her
and
that
dog
ca
go
near
it
without
it
trying
to
bite
me
i
do
approve
of
either
of
comin
into
a
quiet
family
like
ours
just
then
the
bell
called
him
to
the
and
further
discussion
of
peg
and
michael
was
deferred
to
a
more
suitable
opportunity
to
return
ethel
read
her
letter
and
went
to
the
to
reply
to
it
who
is
it
from
asked
chichester
brent
replied
ethel
indifferently
brent
cried
alaric
what
on
earth
does
he
write
to
you
for
he
wants
me
to
do
something
for
him
and
she
tore
the
letter
up
into
the
smallest
pieces
and
placed
them
in
a
receptacle
on
the
desk
do
something
questioned
alaric
yes
nothing
very
much
i
answer
it
here
and
she
proceeded
quite
imperturbably
to
write
an
answer
chichester
had
seen
that
peg
had
commenced
to
study
which
meant
with
peg
roaming
through
her
books
until
she
found
something
that
interested
her
then
she
would
read
it
over
and
over
again
until
she
thought
she
knew
it
come
alaric
and
chichester
left
the
room
after
admonishing
peg
that
an
hour
would
be
sufficient
to
sit
up
alaric
watched
his
mother
go
out
of
the
room
and
then
he
slouched
over
to
peg
and
grinned
chaffingly
down
at
her
eh
that
a
good
peg
looked
up
at
him
and
a
dangerous
gleam
came
into
her
eyes
alaric
was
not
going
to
mock
at
her
and
get
away
unscathed
all
unconscious
of
his
danger
alaric
went
on
study
all
the
pretty
maps
and
things
peg
closed
the
book
with
a
slam
and
took
it
up
and
held
it
in
a
threatening
manner
as
she
glared
at
alaric
little
devil
and
alaric
laughed
at
her
he
tuggin
at
me
now
replied
peg
the
devil
must
hate
knowledge
he
always
tries
to
keep
me
from
gettin
any
alaric
laughed
again
maliciously
watch
your
cousin
model
yourself
on
ethel
eh
what
peg
hurled
the
book
at
him
he
dodged
it
and
it
just
escaped
hitting
ethel
who
turned
at
the
disturbance
alaric
hurried
out
to
avoid
any
further
conflict
calling
back
over
his
shoulder
little
devil
peg
picked
up
the
book
looked
at
ethel
who
had
finished
the
letter
and
had
put
it
into
an
unaddressed
envelope
she
took
a
cigarette
out
of
her
case
and
lit
it
neatly
peg
took
one
out
of
the
box
on
the
table
and
lit
it
clumsily
though
in
exact
imitation
of
ethel
when
ethel
had
addressed
the
envelope
she
turned
and
saw
peg
smoking
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
table
watching
ethel
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
eye
ethel
impatiently
threw
her
cigarette
on
to
the
ash
tray
on
the
desk
peg
did
the
same
action
identically
into
a
tray
on
the
table
ethel
rose
indignantly
and
faced
peg
why
do
you
watch
me
aunt
told
me
to
are
ye
me
model
i
to
mould
meself
on
you

ethel
turned
away
furiously
and
began
to
ascend
the
stairs
peg
followed
her
and
called
up
to
her
may

talk
to
ye
you
were
told
to

replied
ethel
angrily

urged
peg
then
she
went
on
ye
have
said
a
kind
wurrd
to
me
since
i
been
here
she
stopped
a
moment
ethel
said
nothing
peg
continued
sure
we
both
girls
in
the
same
house
of
the
same
family
an
pretty
much
the
same
age
and
yet
ye

me
except
as
if
ye
hated
me
why
ye
like
yer
dog
betther
than
you
do
me
do
ye
ethel
looked
down
at
pet
and
fondled
her
and
kissed
her
i
sorry
hurt
him
it
was
a
cowardly
thing
of
to
do
to
snap
at
a
little
bit
of
a
thing
like
that
is
but
it
fault
set
him
on
to
it
an
he
always
obeys
me

a
lion
or

and
she
pointed
to
the
poor
little
poodle
if
i
set
him
onto
it
you
made
him
attack
cried
ethel
i
did
i
hate
it
it
so
sleek
and
fat
and
i
hate
fat
things
i
like
them
thin
and
common
like
and
meself
a
dog
should
be
made
to
look
like
a
dog
if
it
is
a
dog
no
one
could
mistake
for
anything
else
but
a
dog
but
that
thing
ethel
gave
an
indignant
ejaculation
and
again
started
to
go
upstairs
peg
entreated
her
do
go
for
a
minnit
wo
ye
make
friends
with
me
we
nothing
in
common
replied
ethel
sure
that
does
prevent
us
bein
dacent
to
each
other
does
it
decent
cried
ethel
in
disgust
i
meet
ye
three
quarthers
o
the
way
if
ye
show
just
one
little
generous
feelin
toward
me
she
paused
as
she
looked
pleadingly
at
ethel
ye
would
if
ye
knew
what
was
in
me
mind
ethel
came
down
to
the
last
step
of
the
stairs
and
stood
there
looking
down
searchingly
at
peg
finally
she
said
you
a
strange
creature
not
at
all
it
you
people
here
who
are
strange
i
just
what
i
am
i
do
pretend
or
want
to
be
anythin
else
but
you
all
of
you
seem
to
be
trying
to
be
somethin
different
to
what
ye
are
what
do
you
mean
asked
ethel
suspiciously
oh
i
watch
ye
and
listen
to
ye
went
on
peg
eagerly
ye
turn
yer
face
to
the
wurrld
as
much
as
to
say
at
me
are
i
the
beautiful
quiet
young
lady
an
yer
nothin
o
the
kind
are
ye
ethel
went
slowly
over
to
peg
and
looked
into
her
eyes
what
am
i
sure
ye
got
the
breedin
all
right
an
the
an
the
beautiful
manners
but
down
in
yer
heart
an
up
in
yer
brain
worryin
yer
little
soul
all
the
time
are
ye
and
peg
paused
ethel
looked
down
peg
after
a
moment
continued
an
ye
got
a
temper
just
as
bad
as
mine
it
a
beautiful
temper
ye
have
ethel
it
a
shame
not
to
let
a
temper
like
that
out
in
the
daylight
now
and
again
but
ye
kape
it
out
o
sight
because
it
is
good
form
to
show
it
an
with
all
yer
fine
advantages
ye
not
a
bit
happy
are
ye
are
ye
ethel
ethel
moved
in
spite
of
herself
admitted
involuntarily
no
i
not
peg
went
on
quietly
nor
am
i
in
this
house
could
we
try
and
comfort
each
other
there
was
a
look
of
genuine
sympathy
with
ethel
in
peg
big
blue
eyes
and
a
note
of
tender
entreaty
in
her
tone
comfort
you
comfort
me
cried
ethel
in
disdain
yes
ethel
dear
me
comfort
you
they
say
beautiful
thought
makes
a
beautiful
face
an
by
the
same
token
sure
a
kind
action
gives
ye
a
warm
feelin
around
the
heart
an
ye
might
have
that
if
ye
only
be
a
little
kind
to
me
sometime
peg
honest
sincerity
and
depth
of
feeling
had
suddenly
a
marked
effect
on
the
apparently
callous
ethel
she
turned
to
peg
and
there
was
a
different
expression
entirely
in
her
look
and
tone
as
she
said
i
afraid
i
have
been
a
little
inconsiderate
ye
have
sure
said
peg
what
would
you
like
me
to
do
i
like
ye
to
spake
to
me
sometimes
as
though
i
were
a
human
an
not
a
clod
o
earth
very
well
margaret
i
will
good
night
and
feeling
the
matter
was
closed
ethel
again
turned
away
to
leave
the
room
will
ye
give
me
another
minnit
now
please
called
peg
after
her
excitedly
ethel
looked
at
the
letter
in
her
hand
hesitated
then
the
room
and
went
down
to
peg
and
said
gently
all
right
only
just
a
minnit
repeated
peg
breathlessly
what
do
you
want
margaret
i
want
ye
to
tell
me
somethin
what
is
it
peg
paused
looked
at
ethel
bashfully
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
ground
took
a
deep
breath
then
said
as
fast
as
she
could
speak
do
ye
know
anything
about
about
love
love
echoed
ethel
very
much
astonished
yes
said
peg
have
ye
ever
been
in
love
and
she
wanted
expectantly
for
ethel
answer
ethel
put
the
letter
she
had
just
written
to
brent
slowly
behind
her
back
and
answered
coldly
no
i
have
not
have
ye
ever
thought
about
it
yes
what
do
ye
think
about
it
questioned
peg
eagerly
rot
replied
ethel
decidedly
rot
rot
cried
peg
unable
to
believe
her
ears
sentimental
nonsense
that
only
exists
in
novels
ye
wrong
insisted
the
anxious
peg
ye
wrong
it
the
most
wondherful
thing
in
the
wurrld
ethel
brought
the
letter
up
to
her
eyes
and
read
the
superscription
think
so
she
asked
calmly
i
do
cried
peg
hotly
i
do
it
the
most
wondherful
thing
in
the
whole
wurrld
to
love
a
good
man
who
loves
you
a
man
that
made
ye
hot
and
cold
by
turns
burnin
like
fire
one
minnit
an
freezin
like
ice
the
next
who
made
yer
heart
leap
with
happiness
when
he
came
near
ye
an
ache
with
sorrow
when
he
went
away
from
ye
have
ye
ever
felt
like
that
ethel
never
replied
ethel
positively
peg
went
on
oh
it
mighty
disturbin
i
tellin
ye
sometimes
ye
walk
on
air
an
at
others
yer
feet
are
like
lead
an
at
one
time
the
wurrld
all
beautiful
flowers
and
sweet
music
and
grand
poetry
an
at
another
it
all
coffins
an
corpses
an
shrouds
she
shook
her
head
seriously
oh
i
tell
ye
it
mighty
disturbin
ethel
looked
at
her
inquiringly
how
do
you
know
this
peg
grew
confused
then
answered
hurriedly
i
been
readin
about
it
in
a
book
it
wondherful
that
what
it
is
when
you
a
little
older
you
will
think
differently
corrected
ethel
severely
you
will
realise
then
that
it
is
all
very
primitive
primitive
asked
peg
disappointedly
of
the
earth
earthy
answered
ethel
peg
thought
a
moment
sure
i
suppose
am
then
she
looked
at
ethel
and
asked
her
quietly
do
you
like
men
not
much
answered
ethel
indifferently
just
dogs
persisted
peg
you
can
trust
them
and
ethel
caressed
pet
little
pink
snout
that
thrue
agreed
peg
i
like
dogs
too
but
i
like
children
betther
would
ye
like
to
have
a
child
of
yer
own
ethel
that
young
lady
looked
at
her
horrifiedly
margaret
well
would
said
peg
that
the
rale
woman
in
us
ye
know
ye
only
fondle
that
animal
because
ye
have
got
a
child
of
yer
own
to
take
in
yer
arms
sure
that
the
reason
all
the
selfish
women
have
pet
dogs
they
afraid
to
have
childhren
i
watched
them
o
course
a
dog
all
very
well
but
he
ca
talk
to
ye
an
comfort
ye
an
cry
to
ye
an
laugh
to
ye
like
a
child
can
peg
paused
then
pointed
to
pet
and
launched
the
following
wonderful
statement
sure
that
thing
could
never
be
president
of
the
united
states
but
if
ye
had
a
baby
he
might
grow
up
to
it
that
very
irish
sneered
ethel
faith
i
think
it
very
human
answered
peg
i
wish
ye
had
some
more
of
it
ethel
acushla
ethel
walked
away
as
though
to
dismiss
the
whole
subject
it
was
most
distasteful
to
her
it
is
not
customary
for
girls
to
talk
about
such
things
i
know
it
is
said
peg
an
the
more
the
pity
why
should
we
discuss
events
of
national
importance
we
think
about
them
very
well
why
should
we
talk
about
them
why
should
girls
be
taught
to
be
honest
with
each
other
i
tell
ye
if
there
was
more
honesty
in
this
wurrld
there
would
be
half
the
sin
in
it
that
there
would
really
began
ethel
let
us
be
honest
with
each
other
ethel
and
peg
went
right
over
to
her
and
looked
at
her
compassionately
what
do
ye
mean
said
ethel
with
a
sudden
contraction
of
her
breath
you
like
brent
do
ye
so
the
moment
had
come
the
little
spy
had
been
watching
her
well
she
would
fight
this
common
little
irish
nobody
to
the
bitter
end
all
the
anger
in
her
nature
surged
uppermost
as
ethel
answered
peg
but
she
kept
her
voice
under
complete
control
and
once
more
put
the
letter
behind
her
back
certainly
i
like
brent
he
is
a
very
old
friend
of
the
family
he
got
a
wife
he
has
an
a
baby
yes
and
a
baby
ethel
was
not
going
to
betray
herself
she
would
just
wait
and
see
what
course
this
creature
was
going
to
take
with
her
peg
went
on
of
course
i
never
seen
the
wife
or
the
baby
because
he
never
seems
to
have
them
with
him
when
he
calls
here
but
i
often
heard
alaric
ask
afther
them
well
asked
ethel
coldly
is
it
usual
for
english
husbands
with
babies
to
kiss
other
hands
and
peg
looked
swiftly
at
her
cousin
ethel
checked
an
outburst
and
said
quite
calmly
it
is
a
very
old
and
a
very
respected
custom
the
devil
doubt
it
but
it
old
i
not
so
sure
about
the
respect
why
does
he
kiss
me
aunt
hand
as
well
ethel
went
quickly
to
the
staircase
she
could
not
control
herself
much
longer
it
was
becoming
unbearable
as
she
crossed
the
room
she
said
with
as
little
heat
as
possible
you
do
understand
well
but
i
thryin
to
persisted
peg
that
why
i
watch
ye
all
the
time
ethel
turned
she
was
now
at
bay
you
watch
me
are
ye
me
model
it
contemptible
cried
ethel
sure
i
only
saw
the
and
respected
custom
by
accident
when
i
came
in
through
there
a
month
ago
an
once
since
when
i
came
in
again
by
accident
a
few
days
aftherwards
i
could
help
seein
it
both
times
and
as
for
bein
contemptible
i
not
so
sure
the
custom
deserve
all
the
contempt
ethel
was
now
thoroughly
aroused
i
suppose
it
is
too
much
to
expect
that
a
child
of
the
common
people
should
understand
the
customs
of
decent
people
mebbe
it
is
replied
peg
but
i
do
see
why
the
common
people
should
have
all
the
decency
and
the
aristocracy
none
it
is
impossible
to
talk
to
you
i
was
foolish
to
have
stayed
here
you
do
understand
you
never
could
understand
peg
interrupted
why
i
never
saw
ye
excited
before
not
a
bit
of
colour
in
yer
cheeks
till
now
except
twice
ye
look
just
as
ye
did
when
brent
followed
that
old
and
respected
custom
on
yer
hand
cried
peg
ethel
answered
this
time
excitedly
and
indignantly
giving
full
and
free
vent
to
her
just
anger
be
good
enough
never
to
speak
to
me
again
as
long
as
you
in
this
house
if
i
had
my
way
you
leave
it
this
moment
as
it
is
as
it
is
her
voice
rose
almost
to
a
scream
her
rage
was
unbridled
what
more
she
might
have
said
was
checked
by
the
door
opening
and
jarvis
showing
in
jerry
jerry
walked
cheerfully
and
smilingly
into
the
roam
and
was
amazed
to
find
the
two
young
ladies
glaring
at
each
other
and
apparently
in
the
midst
of
a
conflict
all
power
of
speech
left
him
as
he
stood
looking
in
amazement
at
the
combatants
chapter
viii
the
temple
of
friendship
ethel
was
the
first
to
recover
her
equanimity
she
came
down
the
steps
greeted
jerry
with
a
genial
handshake
asked
to
be
excused
for
a
moment
and
after
halting
the
departing
jarvis
she
went
over
to
the
opened
the
envelope
added
a
postscript

a
new
envelope
put
the
augmented
epistle
inside
it
sealed
it
handed
it
to
jarvis
saying
send
that
at
once
no
answer
as
jarvis
left
the
room
ethel
turned
to
speak
to
jerry
meanwhile
that
young
gentleman
had
greeted
peg
and
how

this
evening

she
looked
at

jerry
at
that
moment

over
to
ask

for

two
young
ladies
to
go
to
a
dance
it
just
across
from
here
at
the
assembly
rooms

beamed
joyfully
it
was
just
what
she
wanted
to
do
ethel
viewed
the
suggestion
differently
it
very
kind
of
you
she
said
but
it
quite
impossible
oh

peg

exclaimed
jerry
i
sorry
and
ethel
went
to
the
door
so
am
i
replied
jerry
regretfully
i
would
have
given
you
longer
notice
only
it
was
made
up
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
do
you
think
you
could
i
do
care
for
dancing
besides
my
head
aches
what
a
pity
exclaimed
the
disappointed
young
man
then
he
said
eagerly
do
you
suppose
your
mother
would
allow
miss
margaret
to
go
i
ask
her
and
ethel
left
the
room
peg
ran
across

the
door
from
closing
and
called
after
ethel
i
did
mean
to
hurt
ye
indade
i
did
i
wanted
to
talk
to
ye
that
was
all
an
ye
made
me
angry
ethel
disappeared
without
even
turning
her
head
peg
came
into
the
room
ruefully
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
she
was
thoroughly
unhappy
jerry
looked
at
her
a
moment
walked
over
to
her
and
asked
her
the
matter
one
of
us
girls
has
been
all
wrong
i
tried
to
make
friends
with
her
just
now
and
only

her
angry
as

do
every
one
in
this
house
whenever

open
my
mouth

she
looked
at
him
quizzically
for
a
moment
then
she
burst
out
laughing
he
was
glad
to
see
her
spirits
had
returned
and
wondered
as
to
the
cause
she
looked
up
at
him
her
eyes
dancing
with
mischief
misther
jerry
will
ye
take
me
all
the
same
if

aunt

began
astonishedly
but

least
but

one

the
prettiest

it
on
because
i
thought
you
that

someone

hoped

an

come
suddenly
she
broke
out
passionately
oh

bit
of
pleasure

because
i
just
goin
to
that
dance
so
make
up
yer
mind
to
it
jerry
laughed
uncomfortably
she
was
quite
capable
of
doing
such
a
thing
and
getting
herself
into
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
trouble
so
he
tried
to
dissuade
her
he
laughed
cheerfully
there
may
not
be
any
occasion
to
do
such
a
wild
foolish
thing
why
your
aunt
may
be
delighted
me
aunt
has
never
been
delighted
since
she
was
born
have
you
been
annoying
her
again
faith
i
always
doin
that
he
looked
at
the
litter
of
books
on
the
table
and
picked
up
one
how
are
your
studies
progressing
just
the
way
they
always
have
replied
peg
not
at
all
why
not
i
do
like
studying
answered
peg
earnestly
and
are
you
going
through
life
doing
only
the
things
you
like
sure
that
all
life
for
oh
no
it
is
as
you
grow
older
you
find
the
only
real
happiness
in
life
is
in
doing
things
for
others
oh
she
said
quickly
i
like
doin
them
now
for
others
she
looked
up
at
him
a
moment
then
down
at
a
book
and
finished
under
her
breath
when
i
like
the
others
he
looked
at
her
intently
a
moment
and
was
just
going
to
speak
when
she
broke
in
quickly
what
the
use
of
learnin
the
heights
of
mountains
whose
names
i
ca
pronounce
and
i
never
goin
to
climb
and
i
very
much
surprised
at
me
aunt
allowin
me
to
read
about
the
doin
of
a
lot
of
dead
kings
who
did
things
we
ought
to
thry
and
forget
they
made
history
said
jerry
well
they
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
of
themselves
i
do
care
how
high
mont
blanc
is
nor
when
william
the
conqueror
landed
in
england
oh
nonsense
reasoned
jerry
i
tell
ye
i
hate
english
history
it
makes
all
me
irish
blood
boil
suddenly
she
burst
into
a
reproduction
of
the
father
suiting
action
to
word
and
climaxing
at
the
end
as
she
had
so
often
heard
him
finish
is
england
what
is
it
i
say
i
tell
ye
a
mane
little
bit
of
counthry
thramplin
down
a
fine
race
like
ours
that
what
me
father
sez
and
that
the
way
he
sez
it
an
when
he
brings
his
fist
down
like
that
and
she
showed
jerry
exactly
how
her
father
did
it
when
he
brings
his
fist
down
like
that
it
does
matther
how
many
people
are
listenin
to
him
there
is
one
dares
to
conthradict
him
me
father
feels
very
strongly
about
english
history
an
i
want
to
learn
it
is
it
fair
to
your
aunt
asked
jerry
peg
grew
sullen
and
gloomy
she
liked
to
be
praised
but
all
she
ever
got
in
that
house
was
blame
and
now
he
was
following
the
way
of
the
others
it
was
hard
no
one
understood
her
is
it
fair
to
your
aunt
he
repeated
no
i
do
suppose
it
is
is
it
fair
to
yourself
that
right
scold
me
lecture
me
you
sound
just
like
me
aunt
ye
do
but
you
be
at
such
a
disadvantage
with
other
young
ladies
without
half
your
intelligence
just
because
they
know
things
you
refuse
to
learn
then
you
be
ashamed
she
looked
at
him
pleadingly
are
you
ashamed
of
me
because
ignorant
are
ye
not
a
bit
replied
jerry
heartily
i
was
just
the
same
at
your
age
i
used
to
scamp
at
school
and
shirk
at
college
until
i
found
myself
so
far
behind
fellows
i
despised
that
was
ashamed
then
i
went
after
them
tooth
and
nail
until
i
caught
them
up
and
passed
them
did
ye
cried
peg
eagerly
i
did
i
will
too
she
said
will
you
she
nodded
vigorously
i
will
indeed
i
will
from
now
on
i
do
everythin
they
tell
me
learn
everythin
they
teach
me
if
it
kills
me
i
wish
you
would
he
said
seriously
an
when
i
pass
everybody
else
an
know
more
than
anyone
ever
knew
will
ye
be
very
proud
of
me
yes
peg
even
more
than
i
am
now
are
ye
now
i
am
proud
to
think
you
are
my
friend
ye
ha
won
yer
wager
we
are
friends
are
we
i
am
yours
sure
i
yours
all
right
she
looked
at
him
laughed
shyly
and
pressed
her
cheeks
he
was
watching
her
closely
what
are
you
laughing
at
he
asked
do
ye
know
what
tom
moore
wrote
about
friendship
no
shall
i
tell
ye
excitedly
do
see
if
anywan
comin
first
as
he
looked
around
the
room
and
outside
the
door
to
detect
the
advent
of
an
intruder
peg
sat
at
the
piano
and
played
very
softly
the
prelude
to
an
old
irish
song
as
jerry
walked
back
he
said
surprisedly
oh
so
you
play
peg
nodded
laughingly
afther
a
fashion
me
father
taught
me
me
aunt
ca
bear
it
an
the
teacher
in
the
house
said
it
was
dreadful
and
that
i
must
play
scales
for
two
years
more
before
i
thry
a
tune
she
said
i
had
no
ear
jerry
laughed
as
he
replied
i
think
they
very
pretty
do
ye
well
watch
them
an
mebbe
ye
wo
mind
me
singin
so
much
afther
all
ye
only
a
farmer
are
ye
hardly
that
and
jerry
laughed
again
her
fingers
played
lightly
over
the
keys
for
a
moment
this
is
called
temple
to
friendship
she
explained
indeed
and
it
about
a
girl
who
built
a
shrine
and
she
thought
she
wanted
to
put
into
it
she
thought
she
wanted
afther
a
while
she
found
out
her
mistake
listen
and
peg
sang
in
a
pure
tremulous
little
voice
that
vibrated
with
feeling
the
following
temple
to
friendship
said
laura
enchanted
build
in
this
garden
the
thought
is
divine
her
temple
was
built
and
she
now
only
wanted
an
image
of
friendship
to
place
on
the
shrine
she
flew
to
a
sculptor
who
set
down
before
her
a
friendship
the
fairest
his
art
could
invent
but
so
cold
and
so
dull
that
the
youthful
adorer
saw
plainly
this
was
not
the
idol
she
meant
never
she
cried
i
think
of
enshrining
an
image
whose
looks
are
so
joyless
and
dim
but
yon
little
god
cupid
upon
roses
reclining
we
make
if
you
please
sir
a
friendship
of
him
so
the
bargain
was
struck
with
the
little
god
laden
she
joyfully
flew
to
her
shrine
in
the
grove
said
the
sculptor
not
the
first
maiden
who
came
but
for
friendship
and
took
away
love
she
played
the
refrain
softly
after
she
had
finished
the
song
gradually
the
last
note
died
away
jerry
looked
at
her
in
amazement
where
in
the
world
did
you
learn
that
me
father
taught
it
to
me
replied
peg
simply
tom
moore
one
of
me
father
jerry
repeated
as
though
to
himself
came
but
for
friendship
and
took
away
love
is
that
beautiful
and
peg
face
had
a
rapt
expression
as
she
looked
up
at
jerry
do
you
believe
it
he
asked
did
tom
moore
write
it
she
answered
is
there
anything
better
than
friendship
between
man
and
woman
she
nodded
indeed
there
is
me
father
felt
it
for
me
mother
or
i
would
be
here
now
me
father
loved
me
mother
with
all
his
strength
and
all
his
soul
could
you
ever
feel
it
he
asked
and
there
was
an
anxious
look
in
his
eyes
as
he
waited
for
her
to
answer
she
nodded
have
you
ever
felt
it
he
went
on
all
me
life
answered
peg
in
a
whisper
as
a
child
perhaps
remarked
jerry
some
day
it
will
come
to
you
as
a
woman
and
then
the
whole
world
will
change
for
you
i
know
replied
peg
softly
i
felt
it
comin
since
when
and
once
again
suspense
was
in
his
voice
ever
since
ever
since
suddenly
she
broke
off
breathlessly
and
throwing
her
arms
above
her
head
as
though
in
appeal
she
cried
oh
i
do
want
to
improve
meself
now
i
wish
i
had
been
born
a
lady
i
be
more
worthy
of
what
whom
asked
jerry
urgently
and
waiting
anxiously
for
her
answer
peg
regained
control
of
herself
and
cowering
down
again
on
to
the
she
went
on
hurriedly
i
want
knowledge
now
i
know
what
you
mean
by
bein
at
a
disadvantage
i
used
to
despise
learnin
i
laughed
at
it
i
never
will
again
why
i
ca
even
talk
yer
language
every
wurrd
i
use
is
wrong
this
book
ye
gave
me
the
stories
of
the
world
i
never
seen
like
it
i
never
knew
of
such
people
i
did
dhream
what
a
wondherful
power
in
the
wurrld
was
the
power
of
love
i
used
to
think
it
to
kape
to
yerself
and
never
spake
of
out
in
the
open
now
i
know
the
one
great
big
wondherful
power
in
the
wurrld
it
me
love
for
me
father
has
kept
faith
and
hope
alive
in
me
heart
i
was
happy
with
him
i
never
wanted
to
lave
him
now
i
see
there
is
another
happiness
too
an
it
beyond
me
i
no
one
equal
i
just
a
little
irish
nothin
do
say
that
jerry
interrupted
there
an
obstinate
bad
something
in
me
that
holds
me
back
every
time
i
want
to
go
forward
sometimes
the
good
little
somethin
tries
so
hard
to
win
but
the
bad
bates
it
it
just
bates
it
it
does
what
you
call
the
bad
is
the
cry
of
youth
that
resents
being
curbed
and
the
good
is
the
woman
in
you
struggling
for
an
outlet
explained
jerry
will
you
help
me
to
give
it
an
outlet
mr
jerry
in
any
way
in
my
power
peg
as
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
the
momentary
something
was
trembling
on
both
their
lips
and
beating
in
both
of
their
hearts
the
something
old
as
time
yet
new
as
birth
that
great
transmuter
of
affection
into
love
of
hope
into
faith
it
had
come
to
them
yet
neither
dared
speak
peg
read
his
silence
wrongly
she
blushed
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
and
her
heart
beat
fast
with
shame
she
laughed
a
deliberately
misleading
laugh
and
looking
up
roguishly
at
him
said
her
eyes
dancing
with
apparent
mischief
though
the
tear
lurked
behind

my
heart
burstin
for

she
suddenly
hummed
a
waltz
refrain
and
whirled
around
the
room
the
incarnation
of
childish
abandonment
chichester
came
slowly
down
the
stairs
gazing
in
horror
at
the
little
bouncing
figure
as
peg
whirled
past
the
newel
post
she
caught
sight
of
her
aunt
she
stopped
dead
what
does
this
mean
asked
chichester
angrily
peg
crept
away
and
sank
down
into
a
chair
jerry
came
to
the
rescue
he
shook
hands
with
chichester
and
said
i
want
you
to
do
something

will
make
the
child
very
happy
will

allow
her
to
go
to
a

rooms

chichester
severely
i

a
thing
i
could
have
told

she
say
wurrd
for
wurrd
muttered
peg

said
jerry
straightening
up
hurt
at
the
old
lady
tone
the
invitation
was
also
extended
to
your
daughter
but
she
declined
i
thought

niece
a
little
pleasure

a
dance
unchaperoned
my
mother

chichester

cried
peg
vehemently
i

margaret
and
the
old
lady
attempted
to
silence
peg
with
a
gesture
peg
changed
her
tone
and
pleaded
plaze

me
go
i
study
me
head
off
tomorrow
if

a
bit

plaze
let

the
old
lady
raised
her
band
commanding
peg
to
stop
then
turning
to
jerry
she
said
in
a
much
softer
tone
it
was
most
kind
of
you
to
trouble
to
come
over
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
seem
ungracious
but
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
peg
sprang
up
eager
to
argue
it
out
jerry
looked
at
her
as
if
imploring
her
not
to
anger
her
aunt
any
further
he
shook
chichester
hand
and
said
i
sorry

he
picked
up
his
hat
and
coat
and
went
to
the
door
kindly

to
your
mother

sisters
added
chichester
gently
with
pleasure
and
jerry
opened
the
door
good
night
misther
jerry
called
peg
he
turned
and
saw
peg
deliberately
pointing
to
the
pathway
and
indicating
that
he
was
to
meet
her
there
chichester
happened
to
look
around
just
in
time
to
catch
her
peg
reddened
and
stood
trapped
jerry
went
out
the
old
lady
looked
at
her
for
several
moments
without
speaking
finally
she
asked
what
did
you
mean
by
dancing
in
that
disgraceful
way
and
what
did
you
mean

signs

she
went
to
the
table
and
began
eagerly
to
arrange
her
books
once
again
turn
off
the
lights
when
you
finished
said
chichester

chichester

morning
chichester
said
coldly
and
went
on
up
the
stairs
peg
watched
her
out
of
sight
then
jumped
up
all
excitement
and
danced
around
the
room
she
stopped
by
the
table
locked
at
the
open
books
in
disgust
with
a
quick
movement
swept
them
off
the
table
then
she
listened
and
hurriedly
knelt
down
and
picked
them
all
up
again
then
she
hurried
over
to
the
windows
and
looked
out
into
the
night
the
moonlight
was
streaming
full
down
the
path
through
the
trees
in
a
few
moments
peg
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
listened
not
hearing
anything
she
crept
upstairs
into
her
own
little
found
a
cloak
and
some
slippers
and
a
hat
and
just
as
quietly
crept
down
again
into
the
she
just
had
time
to
hide
the
cloak
and
hat
and
slippers
on
the
immense
when
the
door
opened
and
ethel
came
into
the
room
she
walked
straight
to
the
staircase
without
looking
at
peg
and
began
to
mount
the
stairs
hello
ethel
called
out
peg
all
remembrance
of
the
violent
discussion
gone
in
the
excitement
of
the
present
i
studyin
for
an
hour
are
yez
still
angry
with
me
wo
ye
say
i
night
well
then
i
will
good
night
ethel
an
god
bless
you
ethel
disappeared
in
the
bend
of
the
stairs
peg
listened
again
until
all
was
still
then
she
crept
across
the
room
turned
back
the
carpet
and
picked
up
her
treasure
her
marvellous
book
of
she
took
it
to
the
table
made
an
island
of
it
as
was
her
wont
and
began
to
read
the
precious
book
concealed
by
histories
and
atlases
et
cetera
her
little
heart
beat
excitedly
the
one
thought
that
beat
through
her
quick
brain
was
will
jerry
come
back
for
me
chapter
ix
the
dance
and
its
sequel
chichester
uncompromising
attitude
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
what
followed
had
she
shown
the
slightest
suggestion
of
fairness
or
kindness
toward
peg
things
might
have
resulted
differently
but
her
adamantine
attitude
decided
jerry
he
resolved
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
proprieties
he
would
take
the
little
child
to
the
assembly
rooms
put
her
in
the
care
of
his
mother
and
sisters
and
safeguard
at
least
one
pleasure
for
her
and
this
he
did
he
met
her
at
the
foot
of
the
path
when
he
saw
all
the
lights
disappear
in
the
house
they
walked
across
the
lawns
and
meadows
on
that
beautiful
july
night
with
the
moon
shining
down
on
them
once
at
the
great
hall
his
mother
put
the
gauche
little
peg
at
her
ease
introduced
her
to
the
most
charming
of
partners
and
saw
that
everything
was
done
to
minister
to
her
enjoyment
it
was
a
wonderful
night
for
peg
she
danced
every
dance
she
had
the
supper
one
with
jerry
she
laughed
and
sang
and
romped
and
was
the
centre
of
all
the
attention
what
might
have
appeared
boldness
in
another
with
peg
was
just
her
innocent
wilful
nature
she
made
a
wonderful
impression
that
night
and
became
a
general
favourite
she
wanted
it
to
go
on
and
on
and
to
never
stop
when
the
last
waltz
was
played
and
encored
and
the
ball
was
really
ended
peg
felt
a
pang
of
regret
such
as
she
had
not
felt
for
a
long
long
time
it
was
the
first
real
note
of
pleasure
she
had
experienced
in
england
and
now
it
was
ended
and
tomorrow
had
to
be
faced
and
the
truth
told
what
would
happen
what
course
would
chichester
take
send
her
away
perhaps
and
then
peg
brushed
the
thought
away
at
all
events
she
had
enjoyed
that
ones
wonderful
evening
oh
i
am
so
happy
so
happy
she
cried
as
jerry
led
her
back
to
her
seat
at
the
conclusion
of
the
last
dance
sure
the
whole
wurrld
seems
to
be
goin
round
and
round
and
round
in
one
grand
waltz

the
first
time
i

ralely
happy
since

came
here
and

through
you

said
jerry
quietly
faith
these
are
the
only
moments
in
life
that
count
the
happy
ones
why
ca
it
always
be
like
this
why
should
we
just
laugh
and
dance
our
way
through
it
all
went
on
peg
excitedly
the
rhythm
of
the
movement
of
the
dance
was
in
her
blood
the
lights
were
dancing
before
her
eyes
the
music
beat
in
on
her
brain
i
wish
i
could
make
the
world
one
great
for
you
said
jerry
earnestly
do

asked
peg
tremulously

me
every
one
would
that
be
beautiful
an
no
creepin

replied
jerry
your
own
mistress
free
to
do
whatever
you
wished
oh
she
cried
impulsively
would
that
be
wondherful
suddenly
she
gave
a
little
elfish
chuckle
and
whispered
but
half
the
fun
has
been
that
i
supposed
to
be
across
beyant
there
and
here
i
am
stalin
time
she
crooned
softly
the
best
of
all
ways
to
lengthen
our
days
is
to
stale
a
few
hours
from
the
night
me

said
jerry
softly
i
a
thief

replied
peg
with
a
little
laugh
you
the
the
sweetest
dearest
he
suddenly
checked
himself
his
mother
had
come
across
to
say
good
night
to
peg
in
a
few
moments
his
sisters
joined
them
they
all
pressed
invitations
on
peg
to
call
on
them
at
noel
folly
and
with
chichester
permission
to
stay
some
days
jerry
got
her
cloak
and
just
as
they
were
leaving
the
hall
the
band
struck
up
again
by
special
request
and
began
to
play
a
new
french
waltz
peg
wanted
to
go
back
but
jerry
suggested
it
would
be
wiser
now
for
her
to
go
home
since
his
mother
had
driven
away
back
across
the
meadows
and
through
the
lanes
under
that
marvellous
moon
and
with
the
wild
beat
of
the
continental
walse
echoing
from
the
walked
peg
and
jerry
side
by
side
in
silence
both
were
busy
with
their
thoughts
after
a
little
while
peg
whispered
jerry
peg
what
were
you
goin
to
say
to
me
when

resignedly

he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
hand
reverently
at
the
same
moment
the
sound
of
a
high
power
automobile
was
heard
in
the
near
distance
the
brakes
were
put
on
and
the
car
came
to

then
the
sound
of
footsteps

heard
distinctly
coming
toward
the
windows

cried
jerry
go

someone

coming
peg
hurried
in
and
hid
just
inside
the
windows
and
heard
every
word
that
followed
as
peg
disappeared
jerry
walked
down
the
path
to
meet
the
visitor
he
came
face
to
face
with
christian
brent
hello

he
said
in
surprise

jerry
explanatorily

brent
glanced
up
at
the
darkened
windows
there

a
moment
pause
then
out
of
the
embarrassing
silence
jerry
remarked
just
coming
from

uncomfortable
brent

the
other

and
they
walked
on

listened
until
she
heard
the
faint
sounds
in
the
distance
of
the
automobile
being
started
then
silence
she
crept
softly
upstairs
just
as
she
reached
the
top

on
her
way
down

the
room

alaric
pushed
his
electric
light
full
into

all
the
while
and
jerry

alaric
hurried
out
in
different
directions
in
quest
of
restoratives
chichester
came
toward
ethel
thoroughly
alarmed
and
upset
but
peg
would
not
let
her
touch
the
inanimate
girl
go
away
from
her
cried
peg
hysterically

i
want

tell

father

more
about
motherhood
than
any
man
in
the
wurrld
poor
chichester
fell
back
crushed
and
humiliated
from
onslaught
in
a
few
moments
the
two
men
returned
with
water
and
salts
after
a
while
ethel
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
up
at
peg
peg
fearful
lest
she
should
begin
to
accuse
herself
again
helped
her
up
the
stairs
to
her
own
room
and
there
she
sat
beside
the
unstrung
hysterical
girl
until
she
slept
her
hand
locked
in
both
of
peg
promising
to
call
in
the
morning
jerry
left
the
mother
and
son
returned
to
their
rooms
the
house
was
still
again
but
how
much
had
happened
that
night
that
went
to
shaping
the
characters
and
lives
of
these
two
young
girls
who
were
first
looking
out
at
life
with
the
eyes
and
minds
of
swiftly
advancing
womanhood
one
thing
peg
had
resolved
she
would
not
spend
another
night
in
the
chichester
home
her
little
heart
was
bruised
and
sore
the
night
had
begun
so
happily
it
had
ended
so
wretchedly
and
to
think
the
one
person
in
whom
she
trusted
had
been
just
amusing
himself
with
her
leading
her
to
believe
he
was
a
farmer
less
than
that
he
had
once
said
and
all
the
time
he
was
a
man
of
breeding
and
of
birth
and
of
title
poor
peg
felt
so
humiliated
that
she
made
up
her
mind
she
would
never
see
him
again
in
the
morning
she
would
go
back
to
the
one
real
affection
of
her
life
to
the
min
who
never
hurt
or
disappointed
her
her
father
chapter
xii
a
room
in
new
york
we
will
now
leave
peg
for
a
while
and
return
to
one
who
claimed
so
much
of
the
reader
attention
in
the
early
pages
of
this
history
it
had
not
been
a
happy
month
for
him
he
felt
the
separation
from
peg
keenly
at
first
he
was
almost
inconsolable
he
lived
in
constant
dread
of
hearing
that
some
untoward
accident
had
befallen
her
all
the
days
and
nights
of
that
journey
of
peg
to
england
had
the
premonition
of
danger
when
a
cable
came
signed
montgomery
hawkes
acquainting
with
the
news
of
peg
safe
arrival
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
then
the
days
passed
slowly
until
peg
first
letter
came
it
contained
the
news
of
kingsnorth
death
peg
entrance
into
the
chichester
family
her
discontent
her
longing
to
be
back
once
more
in
new
york
this
was
followed
by
more
letters
all
more
or
less
in
the
same
key
finally
he
wrote
urging
her
to
give
it
all
up
and
come
back
to
him
he
would
not
have
his
little
daughter
tortured
for
all
the
advantages
those
people
could
give
her
then
her
letters
took
on
a
different
aspect
they
contained
a
curious
of
happiness
in
them
no
more
mention
of
returning
on
the
contrary
peg
appeared
to
be
making
the
best
of
the
conditions
in
which
she
was
placed
these
later
letters
set
wondering
had
the
great
message
of
life
come
to
his
little
peg
although
he
always
felt
it
would
come
some
day
now
that
it
seemed
almost
a
very
real
possibility
he
dreaded
it
there
were
so
few
natures
would
understand
her
beneath
all
her
resolute
and
warlike
exterior
it
would
take
a
keenly
observing
eye
to
find
the
real
gentle
affectionate
nature
that
flourished
in
the
sunshine
of
affection
and
would
fret
and
pine
amid
unsympathetic
surroundings
that
peg
was
developing
her
character
and
her
nature
during
those
few
weeks
was
clear
to
the
whole
tone
of
her
letters
had
changed
but
no
word
of
hers
gave
him
any
clue
to
the
real
state
of
her
feelings
until
one
day
he
received
a
letter
almost
entirely
composed
of
descriptions
of
the
appearance
mode
of
speech
method
of
thought
and
expression
of
one
jerry
the
description
of
the
man
appealed
to
him
he
apparently
having
so
many
things
in
common
with
the
mysterious
person
who
had
so
vividly
impressed
himself
on
peg
apparently
peg
was
half
trying
to
improve
herself
there
was
a
distinct
note
of
seriousness
about
the
last
letter
it
was
drawing
near
the
end
of
the
month
and
she
was
going
to
ask
her
aunt
to
let
her
stay
on
for
another
month
if
her
father
did
not
mind
she
did
not
want
him
to
be
unhappy
and
if
he
was
miserable
without
her
why
she
would
sail
back
to
new
york
on
the
very
first
steamer
he
wrote
her
a
long
affectionate
letter
telling
her
that
whatever
made
her
happy
would
make
him
too
and
that
she
must
not
on
any
account
think
of
returning
to
new
york
if
she
found
that
she
was
helping
her
future
by
staying
with
her
aunt
all
through
the
letter
he
kept
up
apparent
high
spirits
and
ended
it
with
a
cheery
exhortation
to
stay
away
from
him
just
as
long
as
she
could
not
to
think
of
returning
until
it
was
absolutely
necessary
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
he
posted
that
letter
back
of
his
brain
he
had
hoped
all
through
that
month
that
peg
would
refuse
to
stay
any
longer
in
england
her
determination
to
stay
was
a
severe
blow
to
him
he
lived
entirely
alone
in
the
same
rooms
he
had
with
peg
when
she
was
summoned
abroad
he
was
preparing
in
his
spare
time
a
history
of
the
irish
movement
from
twenty
years
before
down
to
the
present
day
it
was
fascinating
work
for
him
embodying
as
it
did
all
he
had
ever
felt
and
thought
or
done
for
the
great
cause
in
addition
to
this
work
that
occupied
so
many
of
his
free
hours
he
would
give
an
occasional
lecture
on
irish
conditions
or
take
part
as
adviser
in
some
irish
pageant
he
became
rapidly
one
of
the
best
liked
and
most
respected
of
the
thoughtful
active
executive
irishmen
in
new
york
city
the
night
of
the
day
following
the
incidents
in
the
preceding
chapter
incidents
that
determined
peg
future
was
sitting
in
his
little
work
room
surrounded
by
books
of
reference
and
loose
sheets
of
manuscript
developing
his
great
work
the
real
work
of
his
life
because
in
it
he
would
incorporate
everything
that
would
further
the
march
of
advancement
in
ireland
to
work
and
thought
and
government
by
her
people
a
ring
at
the
bell
caused
to
look
up
frowningly
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
receiving
calls
few
people
ever
dared
to
intrude
on
his
privacy
he
preferred
to
be
alone
with
his
work
it
passed
the
time
of
separation
from
peg
quicker
than
in
any
other
way
he
opened
the
door
and
looked
in
amazement
at
his
visitor
he
saw
a
little
round
gentleman
with
spectacles
an
enormous
broad
cloth
suit
patent
boots
with
grey
spats
on
them
and
a
general
air
of
prosperity
and
good
nature
that
impressed
itself
on
even
the
most
casual
observer
is
that
frank
cried
the
little
man
it
is
said
trying
in
vain
to
see
the
man
features
distinctly
in
the
dim
light
there
was
a
familiar
ring
in
his
voice
that
seemed
to
take
back
many
years
you
not
tellin
me

forgotten
me
asked
the
little
man
reproachfully

the
light

the
little
man
came
into
the
room

of
his
heavy
and

up
at

a
quizzing
look
in
his
laughing
eyes

way
from
ould
ireland

hand
the
two
men
shook
hands
warmly
and
in
a
few
moments
had
the
little
doctor
in
the
most
comfortable
seat
in
the
room
a
cigar
between
his
lips
and
a
glass
of

if
he
would
not
live
to
see
the
golden
harvest
ripen
he
felt
proud
to
be
one
of
those
who
helped
in
the
days
of
stress
that
were
gone
her
people
to
the
benefiting
of
the
future
generations
who
would
have
a
legacy
of
development
by
pacific
measures
what
he
and
his
forefathers
strove
to
accomplish
by
the
loss
of
their
liberty
and
the
shedding
of
their
blood
sure
it
the
big
position
they
should
give
you
on
college
green
when
they
get
their
own
government

this
minnit
and
his

filled
up
and
he
turned

jumped
up
quickly
and
turned
the
tall
bronzed
man
around
with
a
hand
on
each
shoulder
though

had
to
stand
to
do
it
and
poured

his
feelings

mcginnis
words
sank
in
when
they
parted
for
the
night
with
many
promises
to
meet
again
ere
long
mcconnell
sat
down
and
wrote
peg
a
long
letter
leaving
the
choice
in
her
hands
but
telling
her
how
much
he
would
like
to
have
her
back
with
him
he
wrote
the
letter
again
and
again
and
each
time
destroyed
it
it
seemed
so
clumsy
it
was
so
hard
to
express
just
what
he
felt
he
decided
to
leave
it
until
morning
all
that
night
he
tossed
about
in
feverish
unrest
he
could
not
sleep
he
had
a
feeling
of
impending
calamity
toward
dawn
he
woke
and
lighting
a
lamp
wrote
out
a
cable
message
miss
margaret
chichester
regal
villa
scarboro
england
please
come
back
to
me
i
want
you
love
from
your
affectionate
father
relieved
in
his
mind
he
put
the
message
on
the
table
intending
to
send
it
on
his
way
to
business
then
he
slept
until
without
a
dream
his
peg
would
get
the
message
and
she
would
come
to
him
at
breakfast
a
cable
was
brought
to
him
he
opened
it
and
looked
in
bewilderment
at
the
contents
sailing
for
new
york

chapter
xiii
the
morning
after
the
morning
after
the
incident
following
peg
disobedience
in
going
to
the
dance
and
her
subsequent
rebellion
and
declaration
of
independence
found
all
the
inmates
of
regal
villa
in
a
most
unsettled
condition
peg
had
as
was
indicated
in
a
preceding
chapter
remained
by
ethel
side
until
morning
when
seeing
that
her
cousin
was
sleeping
peacefully
she
had
gone
to
her
own
room
to
prepare
for
her
leaving
one
thing
she
was
positive
about
she
would
take
nothing
out
of
that
house
she
did
not
bring
into
it
even
to
a
heartache
she
entered
the
family
a
month
before
gore
at
heart
well
she
was
leaving
it
in
a
like
condition
whilst
she
was
making
her
few
little
preparations
chichester
was
reviewing
the
whole
situation
in
her
room
she
was
compelled
to
admit
however
outraged
her
feelings
may
have
been
the
previous
night
that
should
peg
carry
out
her
intention
to
desert
them
the
family
would
be
in
a
parlous
condition
the
income
from
kingsnorth
will
was
indeed
the
one
note
of
relief
to
the
distressed
household
she
had
passed
a
wretched
night
and
after
a
cup
of
tea
in
her
room
and
a
good
long
period
of
reflection
she
decided
to
seek
the
aid
of
the
head
of
the
family
her
son
she
found
him
in
the
lying
full
length
on
a
lounge
reading
the
post
he
jumped
up
directly
he
saw
her
led
her
over
to
the
lounge
kissed
her
put
her
down
gently
beside
him
and
asked
her
how
she
was
feeling
i
did
close
my
eyes
all
night
answered
the
unhappy
old
lady
is
that
rotten
said
alaric
sympathetically
i
was
a
bit
plungy
myself
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
and
he
yawned
and
stretched
languidly
hate
to
have
one
night
rest
broken
he
concluded
chichester
looked
at
him
sadly
what
is
to
be
done
she
asked
despair
in
every
note
we
must
get
in
forty
winks
during
the
day
some
time
he
replied
encouragingly
no
no
alaric
i
mean
about
margaret
oh
the
imp
nothin
that
i
can
see
she
got
it
into
her
stubborn
little
head
that
she
had
enough
of
us
and
that
the
end
of
it
and
the
end
of
our
income
summed
up
chichester
pathetically
well
you
were
a
bit
rough
on
her
mater
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
we
all
been
a
bit
rough
on
her
except
me
i
made
her
laugh
once
or
twice
poor
little
soul
after
all
suppose
she
did
want
to
dance
what
the
use
of
fussing
let
her
i
say
let
her
better
she
should
dance
and
stay
than
for
us
to
starve
if
she
goes
do
reproach
me
dear
i
did
my
duty
how
could
i
consent
to
her
going
a
girl
of
her
age
girl
why
they
grown
women
with
families
in
america
at
her
age
thank
god
they
not
in
england
they
will
be
some
day
mater
they
kickin
over
the
traces
more
and
more
every
day
watch
in
a
year
or
two
i
say
watch
one
time
women
kept
on
the
pavement
now
they
out
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
in
thousands
mark
me
what
ho
they
are
not
women
ejaculated
chichester
severely
oh
bless
me
yes
they
women
all
right
i
met
listened
to
talk
some
of
were
rippers
why
there
was
one
girl
i
really
have
rather
a
fash
on
great
big
girl
she
is
with
a
deep
voice
she
had
me
all
quivery
for
a
while
and
his
mind
ran
back
over
his
militant
past
and
present
just
when
i
had
begun
to
have
some
hope
of
her
alaric
started
i
did
know
you
met
her
do
you
know
marjory
fairbanks
no
replied
chichester
almost
sharply
i
mean
margaret
oh
the
little
devil
did
ye
i
never
did
not
a
hope
i
always
felt
she
ought
to
have
the
inscription
on
dear
old
shakespeare
grave
waving
in
front
of
her
all
the
time
friend
for
heaven
sake
forbear
there
no
hope
for
her
mater
believe
me
i
thought
that
perhaps
under
our
influence
in
time
do
you
think
it
she
will
always
be
a
peter
pan
never
grow
up
she
play
elfish
tricks
if
she
had
a
nursery
full
of
infants
but
persisted
the
old
lady
some
good
man
one
day
might
change
that
ah
but
where
is
he
good
men
who
take
a
girl
like
that
in
hand
are
very
scarce
mater
very
scarce
indeed
oh
no
back
she
goes
to
america
and
off
i
go
to
work
must
hold
the
roof
up
mater
and
pacify
the
tradesmen
i
given
up
the
doctor
idea
takes
too
long
to
make
anything
and
it
not
altogether
a
nice
way
to
earn
your
living
no
on
the
whole
i
think
canada
chichester
rose
in
alarm
canada
my
boy
nice
big
place
plenty
of
room
we
all
so
crowded
together
here
in
england
all
the
professions
are
with
people
waitin
to
squeeze
in
somewhere
give
me
the
new
big
countries
england
is
too
old
and
small
a
fellow
with
my
temperament
can
hardly
turn
round
and
take
a
full
breath
in
an
island
our
size
out
there
with
millions
of
acres
to
choose
from
i
just
squat
down
on
a
thousand
or
so
raise
cattle
and
in
a
year
or
two
i
be
quite
independent
then
back
i
come
here
and
invest
it
see
do
go
away
from
me
alaric
i
could
bear
that
all
right
if
you
say
so
mater
but
it
does
seem
a
shame
to
let
all
that
good
land
go
to
waste
when
it
can
be
had
for
the
asking
well
i
wander
round
the
fields
for
a
bit
and
thrash
it
all
out
how
clear
a
fellow
head
gets
in
the
open
air
do
you
worry
mater
i
beat
the
whole
thing
out
by
myself
he
patted
the
old
lady
gently
on
the
shoulder
and
humming
a
ballad
cheerfully
started
off
into
the
garden
he
had
only
gone
a
few
steps
when
his
mother
called
to
him
he
stopped
she
joined
him
excitedly
oh
alaric
there
is
a
way
one
way
that
would
save
us
and
she
trembled
as
she
paused
as
if
afraid
to
tell
him
what
the
alternative
was
is
there
mater
what
is
it
it
rests
with
you
dear
does
it
very
good
i
do
it
will
you
honour
bright
i
will
whatever
it
is
to
save
you
and
ethel
and
the
roof
i
will
now
you
got
me
all
strung
up
let
me
hear
it
she
drew
him
into
a
little
arbour
in
the
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
the
open
windows
alaric
she
asked
in
a
tone
that
suggested
their
fate
hung
on
his
answer
alaric
do
you
like
her
like
whom
margaret
do
you
here
and
there
she
amuses
me
like
anything
at
times
she
drew
a
map
of
europe
once
that
i
think
was
the
most
fearful
and
wonderful
thing
i
have
ever
seen
she
said
it
was
the
way
her
father
would
like
to
see
europe
she
had
england
scotland
and
wales
in
germany
and
the
rest
of
the
map
was
ireland
made
me
laugh
like
anything
and
he
chuckled
at
the
remembrance
suddenly
chichester
placed
both
of
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
exclaimed
oh
my
boy
alaric
my
son
hello
cried
the
astonished
youth
what
is
it
you
not
goin
to
cry
are
ye
she
was
already
weeping
copiously
as
she
gasped
between
her
sobs
oh
if
you
only
could
could
what
take
that
little
wayward
child
into
your
life
and
mould
her
here
one
moment
mater
let
me
get
the
full
force
of
your
idea
you
want
me
to
mould
margaret
yes
dear
ha
he
laughed
uneasily
then
said
decidedly
no
mater
no
i
can
do
most
things
but
as
a
moulder
oh
no
let
ethel
do
it
if
stay
that
is
alaric
my
dear
i
mean
to
take
her
really
into
your
life
have
and
to
hold
and
she
looked
pleadingly
at
him
through
her
eyes
but
i
do
want
to
hold
her
mater
reasoned
her
son
it
would
be
the
saving
of
her
urged
the
old
lady
that
all
very
well
but
what
about
me
it
would
be
the
saving
of
us
all
she
insisted
significantly
but
alaric
was
still
obtuse
now
how
would
my
holding
and
moulding
margaret
save
us
the
old
lady
placed
her
cards
deliberately
on
the
table
as
she
said
sententiously
she
would
stay
with
us
here
if
you
were
engaged
to
her
the
shock
had
cone
his
mother
terrible
alternative
was
now
before
him
in
all
its
naked
horror
a
shiver
ran
through
him
the
thought
of
a
man
with
a
future
as
brilliant
as
his
being
blighted
at
the
outset
by
such
a
misalliance
he
felt
the
colour
leave
his
face
he
knew
he
was
ghastly
pale
the
little
arbour
seemed
to
close
in
on
him
and
stifle
him
he
could
scarcely
breathe
he
murmured
his
eyes
half
closed
as
if
picturing
some
vivid
nightmare
engaged
do
mother
please
he
trembled
again
good
lord
engaged
to
that
tomboy
the
thought
seemed
to
strike
him
to
the
very
core
of
his
being
he
who
might
ally
himself
with
anyone
sacrificing
his
hopes
of
happiness
and
advancement
with
a
child
of
the
earth
do
mother
he
repeated
in
a
cry
of
entreaty
she
has
the
blood
of
the
kingsnorths
reminded
chichester
it
is
pretty
well
covered
up
in
irish
replied
alaric
bitterly
please
do
say
any
more
mater
you
have
upset
me
for
the
day
really
you
have
for
the
whole
day
but
his
mother
was
not
to
be
shaken
so
easily
in
her
determination
she
went
on
she
has
the
breeding
of
my
sister
angela
dear
you
would
think
it
to
watch
her
and
listen
to
her
now
once
and
for
all
and
he
tried
to
pass
his
mother
and
go
into
the
garden
there
was
no
escape
chichester
held
him
firmly
she
will
have
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
when
she
is
she
looked
the
alarmed
youth
straight
in
the
eyes
she
was
fighting
for
her
own
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
parting
with
this
home
where
she
had
lived
so
happily
with
her
husband
and
where
her
two
children
were
born
and
reared
even
though
peg
was
not
of
the
same
caste
much
could
be
done
with
her
once
accept
her
into
the
family
and
the
rest
would
be
easy
as
she
looked
piercingly
into
alaric
eyes
he
caught
the
full
significance
of
the
suggestion
his
lips
pursed
to
whistle
but
no
sound
came
through
them
he
muttered
hoarsely
as
though
he
were
signing
away
his
right
to
happiness
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
five
thousand
of
the
very
best
chichester
took
the
slowly
articulated
words
in
token
of
acceptance
he
would
do
it
she
knew
he
would
always
ready
to
rise
to
a
point
of
honour
and
to
face
a
duty
or
confront
a
danger
he
was
indeed
her
son
she
took
him
in
her
arms
and
pressed
his
reluctant
and
shrinking
body
to
her
breast
oh
my
boy
she
wailed
joyfully
my
dear
dear
boy
alaric
disengaged
himself
alertly
here
half
a
minute
mater
half
a
minute
please

ca
burn
all
one
boats
like
that
without
a
cry
for
help
think
what
it
would
mean
dear
your
family
preserved
and
a
brand
snatched
from
the
burning
that
just
it
it
all
right
savin
the
family
any
cove
do
that
at
a
pinch
but
i
do
not
see
myself
as
a
besides
i
am
not
altogether
at
liberty
what
cried
his
mother
oh
i
not
committed
myself
to
anything
but
i
been
three
times
to
hear
that
wonderful
woman
speak
once
on
the
platform
and
people
are
beginning
to
talk
she
thinks
no
end
of
me
sent
me
a
whole
lot
of
stuff
last
week
literature
she
calls
it
i
got
all
upstairs
wrote
every
word
of
herself
never
saw
a
woman
who
can
talk
and
write
as
she
can
and
outside
of
all
that
i
afraid
i
more
or
less
encouraged
her
and
there
you
are
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
it
would
unite
our
blood
alaric
the
fond
mother
insisted
oh
hang
our
blood
i
beg
your
pardon
mater
but
really
i
ca
make
our
blood
the
first
thing
it
would
settle
you
for
life
dear
she
suggested
after
a
pause
i
certainly
be
settled
all
right
in
a
despairing
tone
think
what
it
would
mean
alaric
i
am
mater
i
thinking
and
thinking
awfully
hard
now
just
a
moment
do
let
either
of
us
talk
just
let
us
think
i
know
how
much
is
at
stake
for
the
family
and
you
realise
how
much
is
at
stake
for
me
do
you
indeed
i
do
and
if
i
did
think
you
would
be
happy
i
would
not
allow
it
indeed
i
would
alaric
thought
for
a
few
moments
the
result
of
this
mental
activity
took
form
and
substance
as
follows
she
is
not
at
times
when
she
properly
dressed
i
seen
her
look
almost
beautiful
cried
chichester
alaric
suddenly
grew
depressed
shockin
temper
mater
and
he
shook
his
head
despondently
that
would
soften
under
the
restraining
hand
of
affection
reasoned
his
mother
she
would
have
to
dress
her
hair
and
drop
dogs
i
will
not
have
a
dog
all
over
the
place
and
i
do
like
tidiness
in
women
especially
their
hair
in
that
i
would
have
to
be
obeyed
the
woman
who
loves
always
obeys
cried
his
mother
ah
there
we
have
it
and
alaric
sprang
up
and
faced
the
old
lady
there
we
have
it
does
she
love
me
chichester
looked
fondly
at
her
only
son
and
answered
how
could
she
be
near
you
for
the
last
month
and
not
love
you
alaric
nodded
of
course
there
is
that
now
let
me
see
just
get
a
solid
grip
on
the
whole
thing
if
she
loves
me
and
taking
all
things
into
consideration
for
your
sake
and
darling
ethel
and
for
my
that
is
he
suddenly
broke
off
took
his
mother
hand
between
both
of
his
and
pressed
it
encouragingly
and
with
the
courage
of
hopefulness
he
said
anyway
mater
it
a
go
i
do
it
it
will
take
a
bit
of
doin
but
i
do
it
bless
you
my
boy
said
the
overjoyed
mother
bless
you
as
they
came
out
of
the
little
arbour
it
seemed
as
if
fate
had
changed
the
whole
horizon
for
the
chichester
family
chichester
was
happy
in
the
consciousness
that
her
home
and
her
family
would
lie
free
from
the
biting
grip
of
debt
alaric
on
the
other
hand
seemed
to
have
all
the
sunlight
suddenly
stricken
out
of
his
life
still
it
was
his
duty
and
duty
was
in
the
chichester
motto
as
mother
and
son
walked
slowly
toward
the
house
they
looked
up
and
gazing
through
a
tiny
casement
of
the
little
was
peg
her
face
white
and
drawn
alaric
shivered
again
as
he
thought
of
his
sacrifice
chapter
xiv
alaric
to
the
rescue
chichester
went
up
to
the
a
little
later
and
found
peg
in
the
same
attitude
looking
out
of
the
window
thinking
good
morning
margaret
she
began
and
her
tone
was
most
conciliatory
not
to
say
almost
kindly
good
mornin
replied
peg
dully
i
am
afraid
i
was
a
little
harsh
with
you
last
night
the
old
lady
added
it
was
the
nearest
suggestion
of
an
apology
chichester
had
ever
made
ye
never
be
again
flashed
back
peg
sharply
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
saying
to
alaric
i
shall
never
be
harsh
with
you
again
never
if
chichester
thought
the
extraordinary
unbending
would
produce
an
equally
spirit
in
peg
she
was
unhappily
mistaken
peg
did
not
vary
her
tone
or
hear
attitude
both
were
absolutely
uncompromising
ye
have
to
go
to
new
york
if
ye
ever
want
to
be
harsh
with
me
again
that
is
where
ye
have
to
go
to
new
york
you
are
surely
not
going
to
leave
us
just
on
account
of
a
few
words
of
correction
reasoned
chichester
i
am
replied
peg
obstinately
an
ye
done
all
the
ye
ever
do
with
me
have
you
thought
of
all
you
are
giving
up
i
thought
all
through
the
night
of
what
i
am
going
back
to
and
i
am
going
back
to
it
as
soon
as
hawkes
comes
and
now
if
ye
mind
i
rather
be
left
alone
i
have
a
whole
lot
to
think
about
they
not
very
happy
thoughts
ayther
an
i
rather
be
by
meself
if
ye
plaze
there
was
a
final
air
of
dismissal
about
peg
that
astonished
and
grieved
the
old
lady
how
their
places
had
changed
in
a
few
hours
yesterday
it
was
chichester
who
commanded
and
peg
who
obeyed
sometimes
now
she
was
being
sent
out
of
a
room
in
her
own
house
and
by
her
poor
little
niece
as
she
left
the
room
chichester
thought
sadly
of
the
condition
misfortune
had
placed
her
in
she
brightened
as
she
realised
that
they
had
still
one
chance
through
alaric
of
recouping
even
slightly
the
family
fortunes
the
thought
flashed
through
chichester
mind
of
how
little
margaret
guessed
what
an
honour
was
about
to
be
conferred
upon
her
through
the
nobility
of
her
son
in
sacrificing
himself
on
the
altar
of
duty
the
family
were
indeed
repaying
good
for
evil
extending
the
olive
branch
in
tendering
their
idol
as
a
at
the
feet
of
the
victorious
peg
meanwhile
that
young
lady
had
suddenly
remembered
two
things
firstly
that
she
must
not
return
to
her
father
in
anything
chichester
had
given
her
out
of
one
of
the
drawers
she
took
the
little
old
black
jacket
and
skirt
and
the
flat
low
shoes
and
the
hat
secondly
it
darted
through
her
mind
that
she
had
left
jerry
present
to
her
in
its
familiar
beneath
a
corner
of
the
carpet
not
waiting
to
change
into
the
shabby
little
dress
she
hurried
downstairs
into
the
empty
ran
across
and
there
sure
enough
was
her
treasure
undisturbed
she
took
it
up
and
a
pang
went
through
her
heart
as
it
beat
in
on
her
that
never
again
would
its
donor
discuss
its
contents
with
her
this
gentleman
of
title
masquerading
as
a
farmer
who
had
led
her
on
to
talk
of
herself
of
her
country
and
of
her
father
just
to
amuse
himself
the
blood
surged
up
to
her
temples
as
she
thought
how
he
must
have
laughed
at
her
when
he
was
away
from
her
though
always
when
with
her
he
showed
her
the
gravest
attention
and
consideration
and
courtesy
it
was
with
mingled
feelings
she
walked
across
the
room
the
book
open
in
her
hand
her
eyes
scanning
some
of
the
familiar
and
lines
as
she
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
alaric
came
in
quickly
through
the
windows
hello
margaret
he
cried
cheerfully
though
his
heart
was
beating
nervously
at
the
thought
of
what
he
was
about
to
do
and
across
his
features
there
was
a
sickly
pallor
peg
turned
and
looked
at
him
at
the
same
moment
hiding
the
book
behind
her
back
what
have
you
got
there
all
tucked
away
he
ventured
as
the
opening
question
that
was
to
lead
to
the
one
peg
held
it
up
for
him
to
see
the
only
thing
i
takin
away
that
i
did
bring
with
me
a
book
eh
that
what
it
is
a
book
and
she
began
to
go
upstairs
taking
it
away
he
called
up
to
her
that
what
i
doin
and
she
still
went
on
up
two
more
steps
alaric
made
a
supreme
effort
and
followed
her
you
not
really
goin
away
cousin
he
gasped
i
am
replied
peg
an
ye
can
forget
the
relationship
the
minnit
the
cab
drives
me
away
from
yer
door
oh
i
say
you
know
faltered
alaric
do
be
cruel
cruel
is
it
queried
peg
in
amazement
sure
what
there
cruel
in
that
will
ye
tell
me
she
looked
at
him
curiously
for
once
all
alaric
confidence
left
him
his
tongue
was
dry
and
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
instead
of
conferring
a
distinction
on
the
poor
little
creature
he
felt
almost
as
if
he
were
about
to
ask
her
a
favour
he
tried
to
throw
a
world
of
tenderness
into
his
voice
as
he
spoke
insinuatingly
i
thought
we
were
goin
to
be
such
good
little
friends
and
he
looked
almost
languishingly
at
her
for
the
first
time
peg
began
to
feel
some
interest
her
eyes
winked
as
she
said
did
ye
look
at
that
now
i
did
i
say
you
know
and
he
went
up
on
the
same
step
with
her
i
say
really
ye
must
let
what
the
mater
said
last
night
upset
ye
really
ye
must
must
i
now
well
let
me
tell
ye
it
did
upset
me
an
i
still
upset
an
i
goin
to
kape
on
bein
upset
until
i
get
into
the
cab
that
dhrives
me
from
yer
door
oh
come
now
what
nonsense
of
course
the
mater
was
a
teeny
bit
disappointed
that
all
just
a
teeny
bit
but
now
it
all
over
well
was
a
whole
lot
disappointed
an
it
all
over
with
me
too
she
started
again
to
get
away
from
him
but
he
stepped
in
front
of
her
do
go
for
a
minute
why
not
forget
the
whole
thing
and
let
all
settle
down
into
nice
cosy
jolly
little
pals
eh
he
was
really
beginning
to
warm
to
his
work
the
more
she
made
difficulties
it
was
for
alaric
to
overcome
them
the
family
roof
was
at
stake
he
had
gone
chivalrously
to
the
rescue
he
was
feeling
a
gleam
of
real
enthusiasm
peg
reply
threw
a
damper
again
on
his
progress
forget
it
is
it
no
i
not
forget
it
my
memory
is
not
so
convaynient
you
not
goin
to
be
disgraced
again
through
me
she
passed
him
and
went
on
to
the
landing
he
followed
her
eagerly
just
a
moment
he
cried
stopping
her
just
by
an
a
oriel
window
she
paused
in
the
centre
of
the
glow
that
radiated
from
its
panes
what
is
it
now
she
asked
impatiently
she
wanted
to
go
back
to
her
room
and
make
her
final
preparations
alaric
looked
at
her
with
what
he
meant
to
be
adoration
in
his
eyes
do
you
know
i
grown
really
awfully
fond
of
you
his
voice
quivered
and
broke
he
had
reached
one
of
the
crises
of
his
life
peg
looked
at
him
and
a
smile
broadened
across
her
face
no
i
did
know
it
when
did
ye
find
it
out
just
now
down
in
that
room
when
the
thought
flashed
through
me
that
perhaps
you
really
meant
to
leave
us
it
went
all
through
me
my
honour
it
did
the
idea
positively
hurt
me
really
hurt
me
did
it
now
laughed
peg
sure
an
i
glad
of
it
glad
glad
he
asked
in
astonishment
i
am
i
did
think
anythin
could
hurt
ye
unless
it
disturbed
yer
comfort
an
i
do
see
how
my
goin
will
do
that
oh
but
it
will
persisted
alaric
really
it
will
sure
now
peg
was
growing
really
curious
what
was
this
odd
little
fellow
trying
to
tell
her
he
looked
so
tremendously
in
earnest
about
something
what
in
the
world
was
it
alaric
answered
her
without
daring
to
look
at
her
he
fixed
his
eye
on
his
pointed
shoe
and
said
quaveringly
you
know
meetin
a
girl
round
the
house
for
a
whole
month
as
met
you
has
an
awful
effect
on
a
fellow
awful
really
awful
cried
peg
yes
indeed
it
has
it
grows
part
of
one
life
as
it
were
not
to
see
you
running
up
and
down
those
stairs
sittin
about
all
over
the
place
studyin
all
your
jolly
books
and
everything
you
know
the
thought
bruises
me
really
it
bruises
peg
laughed
heartily
her
good
humour
was
coming
back
to
her
sure
ye
get
over
it
alaric
she
said
encouragingly
that
just
it
he
protested
anxiously
i
afraid
i
wo
get
over
it
do
you
know
i
quite
now
indeed
i
am
repeated
peg
growing
more
and
more
amused
alaric
touched
his
heart
tenderly
yes
really
all
round
here
perhaps
it
because
i
disturbed
yer
night
rest
alaric
you
disturbed
all
my
rest
if
you
go
i
never
have
any
rest
once
again
he
spurred
on
his
flagging
spirits
and
threw
all
his
ardour
into
the
appeal
i
really
begun
to
care
for
you
very
much
oh
very
very
much
it
all
came
to
me
in
a
flash
down
in
the
room
and
for
the
moment
he
really
meant
it
he
began
to
see
qualities
in
his
little
cousin
which
he
had
never
noticed
before
and
the
fact
that
she
was
not
apparently
a
willing
victim
added
zest
to
the
attack
peg
looked
at
him
with
unfeigned
interest
sure
that
does
ye
a
great
dale
of
credit
i
been
thinkin
all
the
time
i
known
ye
that
ye
only
cared
for
yerself
like
all
englishmen
oh
no
protested
alaric
oh
dear
no
we
care
a
great
deal
at
times
oh
a
great
deal
and
never
say
a
word
about
it
not
a
single
word
you
know
we
hate
to
wear
our
hearts
on
our
sleeves
i
do
blame
ye
ye
wear
them
out
too
soon
maybe
alaric
felt
that
the
moment
had
now
really
come
cousin
he
said
and
his
voice
dropped
to
the
caressing
note
of
a
wooer
cousin
do
you
know
i
am
going
to
do
something
now
i
never
done
before
he
paused
to
let
the
full
force
of
what
was
to
come
have
its
real
value
what
is
it
alaric
peg
asked
all
unconscious
of
the
drama
that
was
taking
place
in
her
cousin
heart
sure
what
is
it
ye
not
to
do
somethin
useful
are
ye
he
braced
himself
and
went
on
i
am
going
to
ask
a
very
charming
young
lady
to
marry
me
eh
are
ye
i
am
what
do
ye
think
o
that
now
and
who
do
you
think
it
is
he
waited
wondering
if
she
would
guess
correctly
it
would
be
so
helpful
if
only
she
could
but
she
was
so
unexpected
i
could
guess
it
in
a
hundred
years
alaric
ralely
i
could
oh
try
do
try
he
urged
i
could
think
who
marry
you
indade
i
could
mebbe
the
poor
girl
blind
is
that
it
ca
you
guess
no
really
no
i
tellin
ye
who
is
it
you
the
moment
had
come
the
die
was
cast
his
life
was
in
the
hands
of
fate
and
of
peg
he
waited
breathlessly
for
the
effect
peg
looked
at
him
in
blank
astonishment
all
expression
had
left
her
face
then
she
leaned
back
against
the
balustrade
and
laughed
long
and
unrestrainedly
she
laughed
until
the
tears
came
coursing
down
her
cheeks
alaric
was
at
first
nonplussed
then
he
grasped
the
situation
in
its
full
significance
it
was
just
a
touch
of
hysteria
he
joined
her
and
laughed
heartily
as
well
aha
he
cried
between
laughs
that
a
splendid
sign
splendid
i
always
been
told
that
girls
cry
when
they
proposed
to
sure
that
what
i
doin
gasped
peg
i
cryin
laughin
alaric
suddenly
checked
his
mirth
and
said
seriously
ye
must
know
cousin
that
i
nothin
to
offer
you
except
a
devotion
a
decent
old
name
and
my
career
when
once
i
get
it
goin
i
only
need
an
incentive
to
make
no
end
of
a
splash
in
the
world
you
would
be
my
incentive
peg
could
hardly
believe
her
ears
she
looked
at
alaric
while
her
eyes
danced
mischievously
go
on
she
said
go
on
sure
ye
doin
fine
then
it
all
right
he
asked
fervently
faith
i
think
it
wondherful
good
excellent
but
there
are
one
or
two
little
things
to
be
settled
first
even
as
the
victorious
general
with
the
capitulated
citadel
it
was
time
to
dictate
terms
delays
in
such
matters
alaric
had
often
been
told
were
unwise
a
clear
understanding
at
the
beginning
saved
endless
complications
afterwards
just
a
few
little
things
he
went
on
such
as
a
little
obedience
that
most
essential
a
modicum
of
care
about
ordinary
things
for
instance
about
dress
speech
hair
et
ectera
and
no
oh
cried
peg
dejectedly
while
her
eyes
beamed
playfully
sure
could
i
have
no
he
said
firmly
it
was
well
she
should
understand
that
once
and
for
all
he
had
never
in
a
long
experience
seen
a
dog
he
disliked
more
oh
ejaculated
peg
plaintively
prepared
to
at
any
rate
compromise
rather
than
have
an
open
rupture
he
hastened
to
modify
his
attitude
at
least
not
in
the
house
in
the
stables
queried
peg
we
give
him
a
jolly
little
kennel
somewhere
if
you
really
wanted
him
and
you
could
see
him
say
twice
a
day
he
felt
a
thrill
of
generosity
as
he
thus
unbent
from
his
former
rigid
attitude
then
it
would
be
me
love
my
dog
quizzed
peg
well
really
you
know
one
can
not
regulate
one
life
by
proverbs
cousin
can
one
he
reasoned
but
is
all
i
have
in
the
wurrld
except
me
father
now
what
could
ye
give
me
instead
of
him
here
was
where
a
little
humour
would
save
the
whole
situation
things
were
becoming
strained
and
over
a
dog
alaric
would
use
his
subtler
humour
keen
as
bright
steel
and
turn
the
edge
of
the
discussion
what
can
i
give
you
instead
of
he
paused
laughed
cheerfully
and
bent
tenderly
aver
her
and
whispered
myself
dear
cousin
myself
and
he
leaned
back
and
watched
the
effect
a
quick
joke
at
the
right
moment
had
so
often
saved
the
day
it
would
again
he
was
sure
after
a
moment
he
whispered
softly
what
do
you
say
dear
cousin
peg
looked
up
at
him
innocently
and
answered
sure
i
think
i
rather
have
if
ye
do
mind
he
started
forward
oh
come
i
say
you
do
mean
that
i
do
she
answered
decidedly
but
think
just
for
one
moment
of
the
advantages
for
you
or
for
me
asked
peg
for
you
of
course
replied
the
disappointed
alaric
i
thryin
to
but
i
can
only
think
of
sure
i
get
more
affection
out
of
his
bark
of
greetin
than
i
ever
got
from
a
human
bein
in
england
but
then
he
irish
no
thank
ye
all
the
same
if
it
makes
no
difference
to
ye
i
rather
have
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
refuse
me
he
asked
blankly
if
ye
do
mind
replied
peg
meekly
you
actually
decline
my
hand
and
er
heart
that
what
i
do
really
he
was
still
unable
to
believe
it
he
wanted
to
hear
her
refusal
distinctly
ralely
replied
peg
gravely
is
that
final
it
the
most
final
thing
there
is
in
the
wurrld
replied
peg
on
the
brink
of
an
outburst
of
laughter
alaric
looked
so
anxious
and
crestfallen
now
in
sharp
contrast
to
his
attitude
of
triumph
a
few
moments
before
to
her
amazement
the
gloom
lifted
from
her
cousin
countenance
he
took
a
deep
breath
looked
at
her
in
genuine
relief
and
cried
out
heartily
i
say
you
a
brick
am
i
asked
peg
it
really
awfully
good
of
you
some
girls
in
your
position
would
have
jumped
at
me
positively
jumped
would
they
poor
things
but
you
why
you
a
genuine
little
number
one
brick
i
extremely
obliged
to
you
he
took
her
little
hand
and
shook
it
warmly
you
a
plucky
little
girl
that
what
you
are
a
plucky
little
girl
i
never
forget
it
never
if
there
is
i
can
do
at
any
time
anywhere
call
on
me
i
be
there
right
on
the
spot
he
heard
his
mother
voice
speaking
to
jarvis
in
the
room
below
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
ethel
walking
toward
them
along
the
corridor
he
said
hurriedly
and
fervently
to
peg
bless
you
cousin
you
taken
an
awful
load
off
my
mind
i
was
really
worried
i
had
to
ask
you
promised
to
see
you
before
you
go
hello
ethel
all
right
good
without
waiting
for
an
answer
the
impulsive
young
gentleman
went
on
up
to
his
own
room
to
rejoice
over
his
escape
peg
walked
over
and
took
ethel
by
both
hands
and
looked
into
the
tired
anxious
eyes
come
into
my
room
she
whispered
without
a
word
ethel
followed
her
into
the
mauve
room
chapter
xv
montgomery
hawkes
on
the
day
of
june
montgomery
hawkes
glanced
at
his
appointments
for
the
following
day
and
found
the
entry
chichester
scarboro
in
re
margaret
he
accordingly
sent
a
telegram
to
chichester
acquainting
her
with
the
pleasant
news
that
she
might
expect
that
distinguished
lawyer
on
july
to
render
an
account
of
her
stewardship
of
the
irish
child
as
he
entered
a
carriage
on
the
great
northern
railway
at
king
cross
station
next
day
bound
for
scarboro
he
found
himself
wondering
how
the
experiment
dictated
by
kingsnorth
on
his
had
progressed
it
was
a
most
interesting
case
he
had
handled
several
during
his
career
as
a
solicitor
in
which
bequests
were
made
to
the
younger
branches
of
a
family
that
had
been
torn
by
dissension
during
the
testator
lifetime
and
were
now
remembered
for
the
purpose
of
making
tardy
amends
but
in
those
cases
the
families
were
all
practically
of
the
same
caste
it
would
be
merely
benefiting
them
by
money
or
land
their
education
had
already
been
taken
care
of
once
the
bequest
was
arranged
all
responsibility
ended
the
arrangement
was
an
entirely
different
condition
of
things
altogether
there
were
so
many
provisions
each
contingent
on
something
in
the
character
of
the
beneficiary
he
did
not
regard
the
case
with
the
same
equanimity
he
had
handled
the
others
it
opened
up
so
many
possibilities
of
difficulty
and
the
object
of
kingsnorth
bequest
was
such
an
amazing
young
lady
to
endeavour
to
do
anything
with
he
had
no
preconceived
methods
to
employ
in
the
matter
it
was
an
experiment
where
his
experience
was
of
no
use
he
had
only
to
wait
developments
and
should
any
real
crisis
arise
consult
with
the
chief
executor
by
the
time
he
reached
scarboro
he
had
arranged
everything
in
his
mind
it
was
to
be
a
short
and
exceedingly
satisfactory
interview
and
he
would
be
able
to
catch
the
afternoon
express
back
to
london
he
pictured
miss
as
being
marvellously
improved
by
her
gentle
surroundings
and
eager
to
continue
in
them
he
was
sure
he
would
have
a
most
satisfactory
report
to
make
to
the
chief
executor
as
he
walked
up
the
he
was
humming
gaily
an
air
from
he
was
entirely
free
from
care
and
annoyance
he
was
thinking
what
a
fortunate
young
lady
miss
was
to
live
amid
such
delightful
surroundings
it
would
be
many
a
long
day
before
she
would
ever
think
of
leaving
her
aunt
all
of
which
points
to
the
obvious
fact
that
even
gentlemen
with
legal
brains
occasionally
the
result
of
force
of
character
over
circumstances
he
was
shown
into
the
and
was
admiring
a
genuine
greuze
when
chichester
came
in
she
greeted
him
tragically
and
motioned
him
to
a
seat
beside
her
well
he
smiled
cheerfully
and
how
is
our
little
protegee
sit
down
replied
chichester
sombrely
thank
you
he
sat
beside
her
waited
a
moment
then
with
some
sense
of
misgiving
asked
everything
going
well
i
hope
far
from
it
and
chichester
shook
her
head
sadly
indeed
his
misgivings
deepened
i
want
you
to
understand
one
thing
hawkes
and
tears
welled
up
into
the
old
lady
eyes
i
have
done
my
best
i
am
sure
of
that
chichester
assured
the
lawyer
growing
more
and
more
apprehensive
but
she
wants
to
leave
us
she
has
ordered
cab
she
is
packing
now
dear
dear
ejaculated
the
bewildered
solicitor
where
is
she
going
back
to
her
father
how
perfectly
ridiculous
why
i
had
occasion
to
speak
to
her
severely
last
night
she
grew
very
angry
and
indignant
and
now
she
has
ordered
a
cab
oh
and
hawkes
laughed
easily
a
little
childish
temper
leave
her
to
me
i
have
a
method
with
the
young
now
tell
me
what
is
her
character
how
has
she
behaved
at
times
admirably
at
others
chichester
raised
her
hands
and
her
eyes
in
shocked
disapproval
not
quite
suggested
hawkes
not
at
all
concluded
chichester
how
are
her
studies
backward
well
we
must
not
expect
too
much
said
the
lawyer
reassuringly
remember
everything
is
foreign
to
her
then
you
are
not
disappointed
mr
hawkes
not
in
the
least
we
ca
expect
to
form
a
character
in
a
month
does
she
see
many
people
very
few
we
try
to
keep
her
entirely
amongst
ourselves
i
would
do
that
let
her
mix
with
people
the
more
the
better
the
value
of
contrast
take
her
visiting
with
you
let
her
talk
to
others
listen
to
them
exchange
opinions
with
them
nothing
is
better
for
intelligent
and
ignorant
people
than
to
meet
others
cleverer
than
themselves
the
moment
they
recognise
their
own
inferiority
they
feel
the
desire
for
improvement
chichester
listened
indignantly
to
this
somewhat
platitudinous
sermon
on
how
to
develop
character
and
indignation
was
in
her
tone
when
she
replied
surely
she
has
sufficient
example
here
sir
hawkes
was
on
one
of
his
dearest
hobbies
characters
and
dispositions
he
had
once
read
a
lecture
on
the
subject
he
smiled
almost
pityingly
at
chichester
as
he
shook
his
head
and
answered
her
no
chichester
pardon
me
but
no
she
has
not
sufficient
example
here
much
as
i
appreciate
a
home
atmosphere
it
is
only
when
the
young
get
away
from
it
that
they
really
develop
it
is
the
contact
with
the
world
and
its
huge
and
marvellous
interests
that
strengthens
character
and
solidifies
disposition
it
is
only
he
stopped
chichester
was
evidently
either
not
listening
or
was
entirely
unimpressed
she
was
tapping
her
left
hand
with
a
lorgnette
she
held
in
her
right
and
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
speak
consequently
hawkes
stopped
politely
if
you
can
persuade
her
to
remain
with
us
i
will
do
anything
you
wish
in
regard
to
her
character
and
its
development
do
be
uneasy
he
replied
easily
she
will
stay
may
i
see
her
chichester
rose
crossed
over
to
the
bell
and
rang
it
she
wanted
to
prepare
the
solicitor
for
the
possibility
of
a
match
between
her
son
and
her
niece
she
would
do
it
now
and
do
it
tactfully
there
is
one
thing
you
must
know
hawkes
my
son
is
in
love
with
her
she
said
as
though
in
a
burst
of
confidence
hawkes
rose
visibly
perturbed
what
your
son
yes
she
sighed
of
course
she
is
hardly
a
suitable
match
for
alaric
as
yet
but
by
the
time
she
is
of
age
of
age
by
that
time
much
may
be
done
jarvis
came
in
noiselessly
and
was
despatched
by
chichester
to
bring
her
niece
to
her
hawkes
was
moving
restlessly
about
the
room
he
stopped
in
front
of
chichester
as
jarvis
disappeared
i
am
afraid
madam
that
such
a
marriage
would
be
out
of
the
question
what
do
you
mean
demanded
the
old
lady
as
one
of
the
executors
of
the
late
kingsnorth
will
in
my
opinion
it
would
be
defeating
the
object
of
the
dead
man
legacy
chichester
retorted
heatedly
he
desires
her
to
be
trained
what
training
is
better
than
marriage
almost
any
replied
hawkes
marriage
should
be
the
union
of
two
formed
characters
marriage
between
the
young
is
one
of
my
pet
objections
it
is
a
condition
of
life
essentially
for
those
who
have
reached
maturity
in
nature
and
in
character
i
am
preparing
a
paper
on
it
for
the
croydon
ethical
society
and
whatever
else
hawkes
might
have
said
in
continuation
of
another
of
his
pet
subjects
was
cut
abruptly
short
by
the
appearance
of
peg
she
was
still
dressed
in
one
of
chichester
gifts
she
had
not
had
an
opportunity
to
change
into
her
little
travelling
suit
hawkes
looked
at
her
in
delighted
surprise
she
had
completely
changed
what
a
metamorphosis
from
the
forlorn
little
creature
of
a
month
ago
he
took
her
by
the
hand
and
pressed
it
warmly
at
the
same
time
saying
heartily
well
well
what
an
improvement
peg
gazed
at
him
with
real
pleasure
she
was
genuinely
glad
to
see
him
she
returned
the
pressure
of
his
hand
and
welcomed
him
i
glad
you
come
mr
hawkes
why
you
a
young
lady
cried
the
astonished
solicitor
am
i
ask
me
aunt
about
that
replied
peg
somewhat
bitterly
hawkes
wishes
to
talk
to
you
dear
broke
in
chichester
and
there
was
a
melancholy
pathos
in
her
voice
and
in
her
eyes
if
neither
alaric
nor
hawkes
could
deter
her
what
would
become
of
them
and
i
want
to
talk
to
hawkes
too
replied
peg
but
ye
must
hurry
she
went
on
i
only
a
few
minutes
chichester
went
pathetically
to
the
door
and
telling
hawkes
she
would
see
him
again
when
he
had
interviewed
her
niece
she
left
them
now
my
dear
miss
margaret
began
the
lawyer
will
ye
let
me
have
twenty
pounds
suddenly
asked
peg
certainly
now
and
he
took
out
his
this
minnit
replied
peg
positively
with
pleasure
said
hawkes
as
he
began
to
count
the
and
i
want
ye
to
get
a
passage
on
the
first
ship
to
america
this
afternoon

earnestly

the
lawyer

what

nonsense

nonsense
i
goin
to

answered
peg
resolutely
just
when
everything
is
opening
out
for
you
asked
the
lawyer
everything
has
closed
up
on
me
said
peg
i
goin
back
why

of
all

she

the
notes
how
have
you
disgraced
them
demanded
the
astonished
lawyer
ask
me
aunt
she
knows
give
me
the
money
please
hawkes
hunted
through
his
mind
for
the
cause
of
this
upheaval
in
the
chichester
home
he
remembered
chichester
statement
about
alaric
affection
for
his
young
cousin
could
the
trouble
have
arisen
from
that
it
gave
him
a
clue
to
work
on
he
grasped
it
answer
me
one
question
truthfully
miss
what
is
it
hurry
i
a
lot
to
do
before
i
go
is
there
an
affair
of
the
heart
d
mean
love
yes
why
d
ask
me
that
answer
me
insisted
hawkes
peg
looked
down
on
the
ground
mournfully
and
replied
me
heart
is
in
new
york
with
me
father
has
anyone
made
love
to
you
since
you
have
been
here
peg
looked
up
at
him
sadly
and
shook
her
head
a
moment
later
a
mischievous
look
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
said
with
a
roguish
laugh
sure
one
man
wanted
to
kiss
me
an
i
boxed
his
ears
and
another
almost
man
asked
me
to
marry
him
oh
ejaculated
the
lawyer
me
cousin
alaric
and
what
did
you
say
questioned
hawkes
i
towld
him
i
rather
have
he
looked
at
her
in
open
bewilderment
and
repeated
michael
me
dog
explained
peg
and
her
eyes
danced
with
merriment
hawkes
laughed
heartily
and
relievedly
then
you
refused
him
of
course
i
refused
him
me
marry
him
what
for
i
like
to
know
is
he
too
young
he
too
selfish
an
too
silly
too
an
too
everything
i
do
like
in
a
man
replied
peg
and
what
do
you
like
in
a
man
precious
little
from
what
i
seen
of
them
in
england
as
hawkes
looked
at
her
radiant
in
her
beauty
her
clear
healthy
complexion
her
dazzling
teeth
her
hair
he
felt
a
sudden
thrill
go
through
him
his
life
had
been
so
full
so
concentrated
on
the
development
of
his
career
that
he
had
never
permitted
the
feminine
note
to
obtrude
itself
on
his
life
his
effort
had
been
rewarded
by
an
unusually
large
circle
of
influential
clients
who
yielded
him
an
exceedingly
handsome
revenue
he
had
heard
whispers
of
a
magistracy
his
public
future
was
assured
but
his
private
life
was
arid
the
handsome
villa
in
pelham
crescent
had
no
one
to
grace
the
head
of
the
table
save
on
the
occasional
visits
of
his
aged
mother
or
the
still
rarer
ones
of
a
married
sister
and
here
was
he
in
the
full
prime
of
life
it
is
remarkable
how
at
times
in
one
passage
through
life
the
throb
in
a
voice
the
breath
of
a
perfume
the
chord
of
an
old
song
will
arouse
some
hidden
note
that
had
so
far
lain
dormant
in
nature
and
which
when
awakened
into
life
has
influences
that
reach
through
generations
it
was
even
so
with
hawkes
as
he
looked
at
the
little
irish
girl
born
of
an
aristocratic
english
mother
looking
up
at
him
hand
outstretched
expectant
in
all
her
girlish
pudicity
yielding
to
some
uncontrollable
impulse
he
took
the
little
hand
in
both
of
his
own
he
smiled
nervously
and
there
was
a
suspicious
tremor
in
his
voice
you
would
like
a
man
of
position
in
life
to
give
you
what
you
most
need
of
years
to
bring
you
dignity
and
strength
to
protect
you
i
got
him
stated
peg
unexpectedly
withdrawing
her
hand
and
eyeing
the
that
seemed
as
far
from
her
as
when
she
first
asked
for
them
you
got
him
ejaculated
the
aghast
i
have
me
father
let
me
count
that
money
the
cab
will
be
here
an
i
wo
be
ready
hawkes
was
not
to
be
denied
now
he
went
on
in
his
softest
and
most
persuasive
accents
i
know
one
who
would
give
you
all
these
a
man
who
has
reached
the
years
of
discretion
one
in
whom
the
follies
of
youth
have
merged
into
the
knowledge
and
reserve
of
early
a
man
of
position
and
of
means
a
man
who
can
protect
you
care
for
you
admire
you
and
be
proud
to
marry
you
he
felt
a
real
glow
of
eloquent
pleasure
as
he
paused
for
her
reply
to
so
dignified
and
ardent
an
appeal
if
peg
had
been
listening
she
certainly
could
not
have
understood
the
meaning
of
his
fervid
words
since
she
answered
him
by
asking
a
question
are
ye
goin
to
let
me
have
the
money
do
not
speak
of
money
at
a
moment
like
this
cried
the
mortified
lawyer
but
ye
said
ye
would
let
me
have
it
persisted
peg
do
you
wish
to
know
who
the
man
is
whom
i
have
just
described
my
dear
miss
no
i
do
why
should
i
with
me
father
waitin
in
new
york
for
me
an
i
waitin
for
that
and
again
she
pointed
to
his
miss
may
i
say
margaret
i
was
your
uncle
adviser
his
warm
personal
friend
we
spoke
freely
of
you
for
many
weeks
before
he
died
it
was
his
desire
to
do
something
for
you
that
would
change
your
whole
life
and
make
it
full
and
happy
and
contented
were
your
uncle
alive
i
know
of
nothing
that
would
give
him
greater
pleasure
than
for
his
old
friend
to
take
you
your
young
life
into
his
care
miss
i
am
the
man
it
was
the
first
time
this
dignified
gentleman
had
ever
invited
a
lady
to
share
his
busy
existence
and
he
felt
the
warm
flush
of
youthful
nervousness
rush
to
his
cheeks
as
it
might
have
done
had
he
made
just
such
a
proposal
as
a
boy
it
really
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
a
boy
as
he
stood
before
peg
waiting
for
her
reply
again
she
did
not
say
exactly
what
he
had
thought
and
hoped
she
would
have
said
stop
it
she
cried
what
the
matther
with
you
men
this
morning
ye
think
i
was
some
great
lady
the
way
ye
all
offerin
me
yer
hands
an
yer
names
an
yer
influences
an
yer
dignities
stop
it
give
me
that
money
and
let
me
go
hawkes
did
not
despair
he
paused
do
give
your
answer
too
hastily
i
know
it
must
seem
abrupt
one
might
almost
say
brutal
but
am
alone
in
the
world
you
are
alone
neither
of
us
have
contracted
a
regard
for
anyone
else
and
in
addition
to
that
there
would
be
no
occasion
to
marry
until
you
are
there
and
he
gazed
at
her
with
what
he
fondly
hoped
were
eyes
of
sincere
adoration
not
until
i
look
at
that
now
replied
peg
it
seemed
to
hawkes
somewhat
flippantly
well
what
do
you
say
he
asked
vibrantly
what
do
i
say
to
what
will
you
consent
to
an
engagement
with
you
yes
miss
with
me
peg
suddenly
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
laughter
hawkes
face
clouded
and
hardened
the
gloomier
he
looked
the
more
hearty
were
peg
ebullitions
of
merriment
finally
when
the
hysterical
outburst
had
somewhat
abated
he
asked
coldly
am
i
to
consider
that
a
refusal
ye
may
what
would
be
doin
marryin
the
likes
of
you
answer
me
that
his
passion
began
to
dwindle
his
ardour
to
lessen
that
is
final
he
queried
absolutely
completely
and
entirely
final
not
only
did
all
hope
die
in
hawkes
but
seemingly
all
regard
as
well
ridicule
is
the
certain
to
a
great
and
disinterested
affection
peg
laugh
still
rang
in
his
ears
and
as
he
looked
at
her
now
with
a
new
intelligence
unblinded
by
illusion
he
realised
what
a
mistake
it
would
have
been
for
a
man
of
his
temperament
leanings
and
achievements
to
have
linked
his
life
with
hers
even
his
first
feeling
of
resentment
passed
he
felt
now
a
warm
tinge
of
gratitude
her
refusal
bitter
though
its
method
had
been
was
a
sane
and
wise
decision
it
was
better
for
both
of
them
he
looked
at
her
gratefully
and
said
very
well
i
think
your
determination
to
return
to
your
father
a
very
wise
one
i
shall
advise
the
chief
executor
to
that
effect
and
i
shall
also
see
that
a
cabin
is
reserved
for
you
on
the
first
steamer
and
i
personally
take
you
on
board
thank
ye
very
much
sir
an
may
i
have
the
twenty
pounds
certainly
here
it
is
and
he
handed
her
the
money
i
much
obliged
to
ye
an
i
sorry
if
i
hurt
ye
by
laughin
just
now
but
i
thought
ye
were
jokin
i
did
please
never
refer
to
it
again
i
wo
indade
i
wo
i
am
sure
it

very
nice
of
ye
to
want
to
marry
me

he
interrupted
stopping
her
with
a
gesture
are
you
goin
back
to
london
by
the
afternoon
express
may
i
go
with
you
certainly
thank
ye
cried
peg
i
wo
kape
ye
long
i
not
much
to
take
with
me
just
what
i
brought
here
that
all
she
hurried
across
the
room
to
the
staircase
when
she
was
halfway
up
the
stairs
jarvis
entered
and
was
immediately
followed
by
jerry
peg
stopped
when
she
saw
him
come
into
the
room
as
jarvis
went
out
jerry
turned
and
saw
peg
looking
down
at
him
the
expression
on
her
face
was
at
once
stern
and
wistful
and
angry
and
yearning
he
went
forward
eagerly
peg
he
said
gently
looking
up
at
her
i
goin
back
to
me
father
in
half
an
hour
and
she
went
on
up
the
stairs
in
half
an
hour
he
called
after
her
in
thirty
minutes
she
replied
and
disappeared
as
jerry
moved
slowly
away
from
the
staircase
he
met
montgomery
hawkes
chapter
xvi
the
chief
executor
appears
upon
the
scene
why
how
do
you
do
sir
gerald
and
hawkes
went
across
quickly
with
outstretched
hand
hello
hawkes
replied
jerry
too
preoccupied
to
return
the
act
of
salutation
instead
he
nodded
in
the
direction
peg
had
gone
and
questioned
what
does
she
mean
going
in
a
few
minutes
she
is
returning
to
america
our
term
of
guardianship
is
over
how
that
she
absolutely
refuses
to
stay
here
any
longer
my
duties
in
regard
to
her
outside
of
the
annual
payment
provided
by
her
late
uncle
end
replied
the
lawyer
i
think
not
hawkes
i
beg
your
pardon
as
the
chief
executor
of
the
late
kingsnorth
will
must
be
satisfied
that
its
conditions
are
complied
with
in
the
spirit
as
well
as
to
the
letter
said
jerry
authoritatively
exactly
was
the
solicitor
reply
and
kingsnorth
expressly
stipulated
that
a
year
was
to
elapse
before
any
definite
conclusion
was
arrived
at
so
far
only
a
month
has
passed
but
she
insists
on
returning
to
her
father
protested
hawkes
have
you
told
her
the
conditions
of
the
will
certainly
not
kingsnorth
distinctly
stated
she
was
not
to
know
them
except
under
exceptional
circumstances
i
consider
the
circumstances
most
exceptional
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
agree
with
you
sir
gerald
that
is
a
pity
but
it
does
alter
my
intention
and
may
i
ask
what
that
intention
is
to
carry
out
the
spirit
of
kingsnorth
bequest
and
what
do
you
consider
the
spirit
i
think
we
will
best
carry
out
kingsnorth
last
wishes
by
making
known
the
conditions
of
his
bequest
to
miss
and
then
let
her
decide
whether
she
wishes
to
abide
by
them
or
not
as
the
late
kingsnorth
legal
adviser
i
must
strongly
object
to
such
a
course
protested
the
indignant
lawyer
all
the
same
hawkes
i
feel
compelled
to
take
it
and
i
must
ask
you
to
act
under
my
instructions
really
exclaimed
hawkes
i
should
much
prefer
to
resign
from
my
executorship
nonsense
in
the
interests
of
all
parties
we
must
act
together
and
endeavour
to
carry
out
the
dead
man
wishes
the
lawyer
considered
a
moment
and
then
in
a
somewhat
mollified
tone
said
very
well
sir
gerald
if
you
think
it
is
necessary
why
then
by
all
means
i
shall
concur
in
your
views
thank
you
replied
the
chief
executor
chichester
came
into
the
room
and
went
straight
to
jerry
at
the
same
time
alaric
burst
in
through
the
garden
and
greeted
jerry
and
hawkes
i
heard
you
were
here
began
chichester
jerry
interrupted
her
anxiously
chichester
i
was
entirely
to
blame
for
last
night
unfortunate
business
do
visit
your
displeasure
on
the
poor
little
child
please
do
i
tried
to
tell
her
that
i
overlook
it
but
she
seems
determined
to
go
can
you
suggest
anything
that
might
make
her
stay
she
seems
to
like
you
and
after
all
as
you
so
generously
admit
it
was
to
a
certain
extent
your
fault
before
jerry
could
reply
jarvis
came
down
the
stairs
with
a
pained
not
to
say
mortified
expression
on
his
face
underneath
his
left
arm
he
held
tightly
a
shabby
little
bag
and
a
freshly
wrapped
up
parcel
in
his
right
hand
held
far
away
from
his
body
was
the
melancholy
and
picturesque
terrier
michael
chichester
looked
at
him
in
horror
where
are
you
going
with
those
things
she
gasped
to
put
them
in
a
cab
madam
answered
the
humiliated
footman
your
niece
orders
put
those
articles
in
a
use
one
of
my
daughter
ordered
the
old
lady
your
niece
objects
madam
she
sez
she
take
nothing
away
she
bring
with
her
the
woman
turned
away
as
jarvis
passed
out
alaric
tried
to
comfort
her
but
the
strain
of
the
morning
had
been
too
great
chichester
burst
into
tears
do
weep
mater
please
do
it
ca
be
helped
we
all
done
our
best
i
know
have
and
alaric
put
his
mother
carefully
down
on
the
lounge
and
sat
beside
her
on
the
arm
he
looked
cheerfully
at
jerry
and
smiled
as
he
said
i
even
offered
to
marry
her
if
she
stay
could
do
more
than
that
could
i
hawkes
listened
intently
jerry
returned
alaric
smile
as
he
asked
you
offered
to
marry
her
alaric
nodded
poor
little
wretch
still
i
have
gone
through
with
it
and
what
did
she
say
queried
jerry
first
of
all
she
laughed
in
my
face
right
in
my
face
the
little
beggar
hawkes
frowned
gloomily
as
though
at
some
painful
remembrance
and
after
she
had
concluded
her
cachinnatory
outburst
she
coolly
told
me
she
would
rather
have
she
is
certainly
a
remarkable
little
person
and
outside
of
the
inconvenience
of
having
her
here
we
should
all
be
delighted
to
go
on
taking
care
of
her
and
if
dancing
is
the
rock
we
are
going
to
split
on
let
us
get
one
up
every
week
for
her
eh
jerry
you
come
would
you
down
the
stairs
came
peg
and
ethel
peg
was
holding
one
of
hands
tightly
there
seemed
to
be
a
thorough
understanding
between
them
peg
was
dressed
in
the
same
little
black
suit
she
wore
when
she
first
entered
the
chichester
family
and
the
same
little
hat
they
all
looked
at
her
in
amazement
amusement
interrogation
and
disgust
respectively
when
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
ethel
stopped
peg
and
entreated
do

must
there
nothin
in
the
wurrld
kape

over
to
chichester
aunt
i
sorry

a
throuble
to

the
poor
lady
looked
at
peg
through
misty
eyes
and
said
reproachfully
why

dress

not
one
of
the
dresses
i
gave

the
way

me
father

the
way

back

replied
peg
sturdily
goodbye
cousin
alaric
and
she
laughed
at
the
odd
little
man
in
spite
of
everything
he
did
he
had
a
spice
of
originality
about
him
that
compelled
peg
to
overlook
what
might
have
seemed
to
others
unpardonable
priggishness
little
devil
cried
alaric
cheerfully
taking
the
offered
hand
good
luck
to
ye
and
take
care
of
yerself
added
alaric
generously
as
peg
turned
away
from
him
she
came
face
to
face
with
jerry
or
as
she
kept
calling
him
in
her
brain
by
his
new
name
to
her
sir
gerald
adair
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
timidly
held
out
her
hand
was
all
she
said
you
not
going

said
jerry
quietly
and
positively
who

to
stop

down
here
in
our
midst

as
he
forced
peg
gently
into
a
chair
chichester
and
alaric
turned
indignantly
on
him
hawkes
moved
down
to
listen
and
if
necessary
advise
there
was
pleasure
showing
on
one
face
only
on
ethel
she
alone
wanted
peg
to
understand
her
position
in
that
house
since
the
previous
night
the
real
womanly
note
awakened
in
ethel
her
heart
went
out
to
peg
chapter
xvii
peg
learns
of
her
uncle
legacy
peg
looked
up
wonderingly
from
the
chair
me
cab
at
the
door
she
said
warningly
to
jerry
i
am
sorry
to
insist
but
you
must
give
me
a
few
moments
said
the
chief
executor
must
cried
peg
it
is
urgent
replied
jerry
quietly
well
then
hurry
and
peg
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
nervously
watching
jerry
have
you
ever
wondered
at
the
real
reason
you
were
brought
here
to
this
house
and
the
extraordinary
interest
taken
in
you
by
relations
who
until
a
month
ago
had
never
even
bothered
about
your
existence
i
have
indeed
peg
answered
but
whenever
i
asked
any
one
always
been
told
it
was
me
uncle
wish
and
it
was
indeed
his
keenest
desire
just
before
his
death
was
to
atone
in
some
way
for
his
unkindness
to
your
mother
nothin
could
do
that
and
peg
lips
tightened
that
was
why
he
sent
for
you
sendin
for
me
wo
bring
me
poor
mother
back
to
life
will
it
at
least
we
must
respect
his
intentions
he
desired
that
you
should
be
given
the
advantages
your
mother
had
when
she
was
a
girl
made
yer
bed
lie
in
it
that
was
the
message
he
sent
me
mother
when
she
was
starvin
and
why
because
she
loved
me
father
well
i
love
me
father
an
if
he
thought
his
money
could
separate
us
he
might
just
as
well
have
let
me
alone
no
one
will
ever
separate
us
in
justice
to
yourself
proceeded
jerry
you
must
know
that
he
set
aside
the
sum
of
one
thousand
pounds
a
year
to
be
paid
to
the
lady
who
would
undertake
your
training
chichester
covered
her
eyes
to
hide
the
tears
of
mortification
that
sprang
readily
into
them
alaric
looked
at
jerry
in
absolute
disgust
hawkes
frowned
his
disapproval
peg
sprang
up
and
walked
across
to
her
aunt
and
looked
down
at
her
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
she
turned
to
jerry
and
asked
does
she
get
a
thousand
a
year
for
abusin
me
for
taking
care
of
you
corrected
jerry
well
what
do
ye
think
of
that
cried
peg
gazing
curiously
at
chichester
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
for
makin
me
miserable
an
the
poor
dead
man
thinkin
he
was
doin
me
a
favour
i
tell
you
this
went
on
jerry
because
i
do
want
you
to
feel
that
you
have
been
living
on
charity
you
have
not
peg
suddenly
blazed
up
well
i
been
made
to
feel
it
and
she
glared
passionately
at
her
aunt
why
was
i
told
this
before
if
i
known
it
i
never
have
stayed
with
ye
a
minnit
who

you
i
like
to
know
to
bring
me
up
any
betther
than
me
father
he
just
as
much
a
gentleman
as
any
of
yez
he
never
hurt
a
poor
girl
feelin
just
because
she
was
poor
suppose
he
has
any
money
nor
me
what
of
it
is
it
a
crime
what
has
yer
money
an
yer
breedin
done
for
you
it
dried
up
the
very
blood
in
yer
veins
that
what
it
has
yer
frightened
to
show
one
real
human
kindly
impulse
ye
do
know
what
happiness
an
freedom
mean
an
if
that
is
what
money
does
i
do
want
it
give
me
what
i
been
used
to
poverty
at
least
i
can
laugh
sometimes
from
me
heart
an
get
some
pleasure
out
o
life
without
disgracin
people
peg
anger
gave
place
to
just
as
sudden
a
twinge
of
regret
as
she
caught
sight
of
ethel
and
staring
at
her
compassionately
she
went
across
to
ethel
and
buried
her
face
on
her
shoulder
and
wept
as
she
wailed
why
was
i
told
i
never
have
stayed
why
was
i
told
and
ethel
comforted
her
do
cry
dear
she
whispered
do
the
day
you
came
here
we
were
beggars
you
have
literally
fed
and
housed
us
for
the
last
month
peg
looked
up
at
ethel
in
astonishment
she
forgot
her
own
sorrow
ye
were
beggars
yes
we
have
nothing
but
the
provision
made
for
your
training
poor
chichester
looked
at
her
daughter
reproachfully
alaric
had
never
seen
his
sister
even
interested
much
less
excited
before
he
turned
to
his
mother
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
i
give
it
up
that
all
i
can
say
i
simply
give
it
up
peg
grasped
the
full
meaning
of
ethel
words
and
will
ye
have
nothin
if
i
go
away
peg
paused
ethel
did
not
speak
peg
persisted
tell
me
are
ye
ralely
dependin
on
me
spake
to
me
because
if
ye
are
i
wo

stay
with

i
would
see
ye
beggars
for
the
wurrld
i
been
brought
up
amongst
them
an
i
know
what
it
is
suddenly
she
took
ethel
by
the
shoulders
and
asked
in
a
voice
so
low
that
none
of
the
others
heard
her
was
that
the
reason
ye
were
goin
last
night
ethel
tried
to
stop
her
the
truth
illumined
ethel
face
and
peg
saw
it
and
knew
holy
mary
she
cried
and
it
was
i
was
drivin
ye
to
it
ye
felt
the
insult
of
it
every
time
ye
met
me
as
ye
said
last
night
sure
if
known
dear
i
never
have
hurt
ye
i
would
indade
i
would
she
turned
to
the
others
there
it
all
settled
i
stay
with
ye
aunt
an
ye
can
tache
me
anythin
ye
like
will
some
one
ask
jarvis
to
bring
back
me
bundles
i
goin
to
stay
jerry
smiled
approvingly
at
her
then
he
said
that
is
just
what
i
would
have
expected
you
to
do
but
my
dear
peg
there
no
need
for
such
a
sacrifice
sure
why
not
cried
peg
excitedly
let
me
sacrifice
meself
i
feel
like
it
this
minnit
there
is
no
occasion
he
walked
over
to
chichester
and
addressed
her
i
came
here
this
morning
with
some
very
good
news
for
you
i
happen
to
be
one
of
the
directors
of
gifford
bank
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
it
will
shortly
reopen
its
doors
and
all
the
depositors
money
will
be
available
for
them
in
a
little
while
chichester
gave
a
cry
of
joy
as
she
looked
proudly
at
her
two
children
oh
alaric
she
exclaimed
my
darling
ethel
reopen
its
doors
alaric
commented
contemptuously
so
it
jolly
well
ought
to
what
right
had
it
to
close
that
what
want
to
know
what
right
a
panic
in
american
securities
in
which
we
were
heavily
interested
caused
the
suspension
of
business
explained
jerry
the
panic
is
over
the
securities
are
rising
every
day
we
soon
be
on
easy
street
again
see
here
mater
remarked
alaric
firmly
every
of
ours
goes
out
of
gifford
bank
and
into
something
that
has
a
bottom
to
it
in
future
i
manage
the
business
of
this
family
the
chichester
family
reunited
in
prosperity
had
apparently
forgotten
the
forlorn
little
girl
sitting
on
the
chair
who
a
moment
before
had
offered
to
take
up
the
load
of
making
things
easier
for
them
by
making
them
harder
for
herself
all
their
backs
were
turned
to
her
jerry
looked
at
her
she
caught
his
eye
and
smiled
but
it
had
a
sad
wistfulness
behind
it
sure
they
do
want
me
now
i
better
take
me
cab
good
day
to
yez
and
she
started
quickly
for
the
door
jerry
stopped
her
there
is
just
one
more
condition
of
kingsnorth
will
that
you
must
know
should
you
go
through
your
course
of
training
satisfactorily
to
the
age
of
you
will
inherit
the
sum
of
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
when
i
i
get
five
thousand
pounds
year
gasped
peg
if
you
carry
out
certain
conditions
an
what
are
they
satisfy
the
executors
that
you
are
worthy
of
the
legacy
satisfy
you
and
mr
hawkes
peg
looked
at
the
somewhat
uncomfortable
lawyer
who
reddened
and
endeavoured
to
appear
at
ease
hawkes
oho
indade
she
turned
back
to
jerry
did
he
know
about
the
five
thousand
when
i
he
drew
the
will
at
kingsnorth
dictation
replied
jerry
was
that
why
ye
wanted
me
to
be
engaged
to
ye
until
i
was
she
asked
the
unhappy
lawyer
hawkes
tried
to
laugh
it
off
come
come
miss
he
said
what
nonsense
did
you
propose
to
miss
margaret
queried
jerry
well
hesitated
the
embarrassed
lawyer
in
a
measure
yes
that
what
it
was
cried
peg
with
a
laugh
it
was
very
measured
no
wondher
the
men
were
crazy
to
kape
me
here
and
to
marry
me
she
caught
sight
of
alaric
and
smiled
at
him
he
creased
his
face
into
a
sickly
imitation
of
a
smile
and
murmured
well
of
course
i
mean
to
say
with
which
clear
and
expression
of
opinion
he
stopped
i
could
have
forgiven
you
alaric
said
peg
but
hawkes
ashamed
of
ye
it
was
surely
a
little
irregular
hawkes
suggested
jerry
i
hardly
agree
with
you
sir
gerald
there
can
be
nothing
irregular
in
a
simple
statement
of
affection
affection
is
it
cried
peg
certainly
we
are
both
alone
in
the
world
miss
seemed
to
be
unhappy
the
late
kingsnorth
desired
that
she
should
be
trained
it
seemed
to
me
be
an
admirable
solution
of
the
whole
difficulty
peg
laughed
openly
and
turning
to
jerry
said
he
calls
himself
a
misther
hawkes
go
on
with
ye
i
am
ashamed
of
ye
well
there
is
no
harm
done
replied
hawkes
endeavouring
to
regain
his
lost
dignity
no
retorted
peg
it
did
go
through
did
it
hawkes
smiled
at
that
and
taking
peg
hand
protested
however
always
your
friend
and
but
nivver
me
husband
insisted
peg
where
are
ye
goin
without
me
you
surely
are
not
returning
to
america
now
said
hawkes
in
surprise
why
of
course
i
goin
to
me
father
now
where
else
would
i
go
hawkes
hastened
to
explain
if
you
return
to
america
to
your
father
you
will
violate
one
of
the
most
important
clauses
in
the
will
if
i
go
back
to
me
father
or
if
he
visits
you
until
you
are
added
jerry
is
that
so
and
the
blood
rushed
up
to
peg
temples
well
then
that
settles
it
no
man
is
goin
to
dictate
to
me
about
me
father
no
dead
man
nor
no
livin
one
nayther
it
will
make
you
a
rich
young
lady
in
three
years
remember
you
will
be
secure
from
any
possibility
of
poverty
i
do
care
i
would
stay
over
here
for
three
years
with
she
caught
chichester
eyes
fastened
on
her
and
she
checked
herself
i
would
stay
away
from
me
father
for
three
years
for
all
the
money
in
the
wurrld
she
concluded
with
marked
finality
very
well
agreed
jerry
then
he
spoke
to
the
others
now
may
i
have
a
few
moments
alone
with
my
ward
the
family
expressed
surprise
hawkes
suggested
a
feeling
of
strong
displeasure
i
shall
wait
to
escort
you
down
to
the
boat
miss
bowing
to
every
one
the
man
of
law
left
the
room
peg
stared
at
jerry
incredulously
ward
is
that
me
yes
peg
i
am
your
legal
guardian
appointed
by
mr
kingsnorth
you
the
director
of
a
bank

executor
of

guardian
what

do
with
yer
spare
time
jerry
smiled
and
appealed
to
the
others
just
a
few
seconds
alone
chichester
went
to
peg
and
said
coldly
margaret
it
is
unlikely
we
meet

i
hope
you
have
a
safe
and
pleasant
journey
i
thank
ye
aunt
monica
poor
peg
longed
for
at
least
one
little
sign
of
affection
from
her
aunt
she
leaned
forward
to
kiss
her
the
old
lady
either
did
not
see
the
advance
or
did
not
reciprocate
what
it
implied
she
went
on
upstairs
out
of
sight
mingled
with
her
feeling
of
relief
that
she
would
never
again
be
slighted
and
belittled
by
chichester
she
was
hurt
to
the
heart
by
the
attitude
of
cold
indifference
with
which
her
aunt
treated
her
she
was
indeed
overjoyed
to
think
now
it
was
the
last
she
would
ever
see
of
the
old
lady
alaric
held
out
his
hand
frankly
jolly
decent
of
ye
to
offer
to
stay
here
just
to
keep
us
goin
awfully
decent

a
little
wonder

whispered

five
thousand
pounds
when
i
i
did

proposed
to

quizzed
peg
like
a
shot
there
somethin
of
the
hero
about
you
alaric
oh

must

replied
modestly

the

positively
so

jolly
good

young
man
walked
over
to
the
door
calling
over
his
shoulder
to
jerry
see
ye
lurchin
about
somewhere
old
dear
and
he
too
went
out
of
peg

she
looked
at
ethel
and
half
entreated
half
commanded
jerry

out
of
the
window
for
a
minnit
i
want
to
spake
to
me
cousin
jerry
sauntered
over
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
at
the
gathering
storm

that
all
over
whispered
peg
yes
replied
ethel
in
a
low
tone
ye
never
see
him
again
never
i
write
him
that
what
must
you
think
of
me
i
thought
of
you
all
last
night
said
peg
eagerly
ye
seem
like
some
one
who
been
lookin
for
happiness
in
the
dark
with
yer
eyes
shut
open
them
wide
dear
and
look
at
the
beautiful
things
in
the
daylight
and
then
you
be
happy
ethel
shook
her
head
sadly
i
feel
that
i
never
know
happiness
again
sure
i
felt
like
that
many
a
time
since
i
been
here
ye
know
three
meals
a
day
a
soft
bed
to
slape
in
an
everythin
ye
want
besides
makes
ye
mighty
discontented
if
ye
go
down
among
the
poor
once
in
a
while
an
see
what
they
have
to
live
on
an
thry
and
help
them
ye
might
find
comfort
and
peace
in
doin
it
ethel
put
both
of
her
hands
affectionately
on
peg
shoulders
last
night
you
saved
me
from
myself
and
then
you
shielded
me
from
my
family
faith
i
do
that
for
any
poor
girl
much
less
me
own
cousin
do
think
too
hardly
of
me
margaret
please
she
entreated
i
do
dear
it
was
yer
fault
it
was
yer
mother
my
mother
that
what
i
said
it
all
in
the
way
we
brought
up
what
we
become
aftherwards
yer
mother
raised
ye
in
a
hot
house
instead
of
thrustin
ye
out
into
the
cold
winds
of
the
wurrld
when
ye
were
young
and
gettin
ye
used
them
she
taught
ye
to
like
soft
silks
and
shining
satins
an
to
look
down
on
the
poor
an
the
shabby
that
no
way
to
bring
up
anybody
another
thing
ye
learnt
from
her
to
be
sacret
about
things
that
are
near
yer
heart
instead
of
encouragin
ye
to
be
outspoken
an
honest
of
course
i
do
think
badly
of
ye
why
should
i
i
had
the
advantage
of
ye
all
the
time
it
is
ivery
girl

the
bringin

as

she
took
ethel
gently
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
i
drive
down
with
you
said
ethel
brokenly
and
hurried
out
peg
stood
looking
after
her
for
a
moment
then
she
turned
and
looked
at
jerry
who
was
still
looking
out
of
the

then
he
added
i

altogether
if
i
could
would
ye
she
asked
curiously
i
would
and
as
for
being
a
gentleman
why
one
of
the
finest
i
ever
met
drove
a
cab
in
piccadilly
he
was
a
gentle
man
that
is
one
who
never
willingly
hurts
another
strange
in
a
cabman
eh
why
did
ye
let
me
treat

all
the
time

an
equal

firmly

replied
positively
i
sorry
will
you
ever
think
of
me
he
waited
she
averted
her
eyes
and
said
nothing
will
you
write
to
me
he
urged
what
for
i
like
to
hear
of
you
and
from
you
will
you
just
to
laugh
at
me
spellin
peg
he
drew
near
to
her
sir
gerald
she
corrected
him
and
drew
a
little
away
peg
my
dear
he
took
both
of
her
hands
in
his
and
bent
over
her
just
for
a
moment
was
peg
tempted
to
yield
to
the
embrace
had
she
done
so
the
two
lives
would
have
changed
in
that
moment
but
the
old
rebellious
spirit
came
uppermost
and
she
looked
at
him
defiantly
and
cried
are
you
goin
to
propose
to
me
too
that
was
the
one
mistake
that
separated
those
two
hearts
sir
gerald
drew
back
from
her
hurt
she
was
right
they
were
not
equals
she
could
not
understand
him
since
he
could
never
quite
say
all
he
felt
and
she
could
never
divine
what
was
left
unsaid
she
was
indeed
right
such
as
this
could
never
be
a
home
for
her
jarvis
came
quietly
in
hawkes
says
miss
if
you
are
going
to
catch
the
train
i
catch
it
said
peg
impatiently
and
jarvis
went
out
peg
looked
at
jerry
back
turned
eloquently
toward
her
as
though
in
rebuke
why
in
the
wurrld
did
i
say
that
to
him
she
muttered
it
me
irish
tongue
she
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
noisily
rattling
the
handle
loudly
hoping
he
would
look
around
but
he
never
moved
she
accepted
the
attitude
as
one
of
dismissal
under
her
breath
she
murmured
misther
jerry
an
god
bless
ye
an
thank
ye
for
bein
so
nice
to
me
and
she
passed
out
in
the
hall
peg
found
ethel
and
hawkes
waiting
for
her
they
put
her
between
them
in
the
cab
and
with
michael
in
her
arms
she
drove
through
the
gates
of
regal
villa
never
to
return
the
gathering
storm
broke
as
she
reached
the
station
in
storm
jerry
came
into
her
life
in
storm
she
was
leaving
his
the
threads
of
what
might
have
been
a
fitting
addition
to
the
love
stories
of
the
world
were
broken
could
the
break
ever
be
healed
chapter
xviii
peg
farewell
to
england
many
and
conflicting
were
peg
feelings
as
she
went
aboard
the
ship
that
was
to
carry
her
from
england
forever
in
that
short
month
she
had
experienced
more
contrasted
feelings
than
in
all
the
other
years
she
had
lived
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
left
her
girlhood
with
all
its
keen
hardships
and
sweet
memories
behind
her
when
the
vessel
swung
around
the
dock
in
liverpool
and
faced
toward
america
peg
felt
that
not
only
was
she
going
back
to
the
new
world
but
she
was
about
to
begin
a
new
existence
nothing
would
ever
be
quite
the
same
again
she
had
gone
through
the
leavening
process
of
emotional
life
and
had
come
out
of
it
with
her
courage
still
intact
her
honesty
unimpaired
but
somehow
with
her
faith
abruptly
shaken
she
had
believed
and
trusted
and
she
had
been
she
thought
entirely
mistaken
and
it
hurt
her
deeply
exactly
why
peg
should
have
arrived
at
such
a
condition
bordering
as
it
was
on
cynicism
was
in
one
sense
inexplicable
yet
from
another
point
of
view
easily
understood
that
jerry
had
not
told
her
all
about
himself
when
they
first
met
as
she
did
about
herself
to
him
did
not
necessarily
imply
deceit
on
his
part
had
she
asked
any
member
or
servant
in
the
chichester
family
who
and
what
jerry
was
they
would
readily
have
told
her
but
that
was
contrary
to
peg
nature
if
she
liked
anyone
she
never
asked
questions
about
them
it
suggested
a
doubt
and
doubt
to
peg
meant
disloyalty
in
friendship
and
affection
everyone
had
referred
to
this
young
gentleman
as
jerry
he
even
introduced
himself
by
that
unromantic
and
undignified
name
no
one
seemed
to
treat
him
with
any
particular
deference
nor
did
anything
in
his
manner
seem
to
demand
it
she
had
imagined
that
anyone
with
a
title
should
not
only
be
proud
of
it
but
would
naturally
hasten
to
let
everyone
they
met
become
immediately
aware
whom
they
were
addressing
she
vividly
remembered
her
father
pointing
out
to
her
a
certain
barrister
who
on
the
strength
of
securing
more
convictions
under
the
crimes
act
than
any
other
jurist
in
the
whole
of
ireland
was
rewarded
with
the
royal
and
governmental
approval
by
having
conferred
on
him
the
distinction
and
dignity
of
knighthood
it
was
the
of
his
career
it
has
steadily
run
through
his
life
since
as
a
thin
flame
of
scarlet
he
lives
and
breathes
knighthood
he
thinks
and
speaks
it
he
demands
recognition
from
his
equals
even
as
he
compels
it
from
his
inferiors
her
father
told
peg
that
all
the
servants
were
drilled
carefully
to
call
him
sir
edward
his
relations
unaccustomed
through
their
drab
lives
to
the
usages
of
the
great
found
extreme
difficulty
in
acquiring
the
habit
of
using
the
new
appellation
in
the
place
of
the
of
his
youth
ted
it
was
only
when
it
was
made
a
condition
of
being
permitted
an
audience
with
the
gifted
and
honoured
lawyer
that
they
allowed
their
lips
to
meekly
form
the
servile
sir
when
addressing
their
distinguished
relation
when
he
visited
dublin
castle
to
consult
with
his
chiefs
and
any
of
his
associates
hailed
him
familiarly
as
ted
a
grieved
look
would
cross
his
features
and
he
would
hasten
to
correct
in
his
broad
coarse
brogue
sir
edward
me
friend
be
the
grace
of
her
majesty
and
the
british
government
sir
edward
if
ye
plaze
there
was
one
who
took
pride
in
the
use
of
his
title
he
desired
and
exacted
the
full
tribute
due
the
dignity
it
carried
then
why
did
not
jerry
do
the
same
she
did
not
appreciate
that
to
him
the
prefix
having
been
handed
down
from
generations
was
as
natural
to
him
as
it
was
unnatural
to
the
aforementioned
criminal
lawyer
the
one
was
born
with
it
consequently
it
became
second
nature
to
him
the
other
had
it
conferred
on
him
for
his
zeal
in
procuring
convictions
of
his
own
countrymen
and
never
having
in
his
most
enthusiastic
dreams
believed
such
a
condition
would
come
to
pass
now
that
it
was
an
accomplished
fact
he
naturally
wanted
all
to
know
and
respect
it
they
were
two
distinct
breeds
of
men
peg
had
occasionally
met
the
type
of
the
honoured
lawyer
they
sprang
up
as
mushrooms
over
night
during
the
pressure
of
the
crimes
act
and
were
liberally
rewarded
by
the
government
some
were
even
transferred
to
the
english
bar
and
they
carried
their
blatant
insistence
even
across
the
channel
but
the
man
of
breeding
who
exacted
nothing
of
culture
who
pretended
not
to
have
acquired
it
of
the
real
power
and
dignity
of
life
yet
was
simplicity
itself
in
his
manner
to
others
that
kind
of
man
was
new
to
peg
she
burned
with
shame
as
she
thought
of
her
what
must
sir
gerald
think
of
her
even
to
the
end
she
was
just
the
little
irish
nothin
as
she
had
justly
it
seemed
to
her
now
described
herself
to
him
she
had
hurt
and
offended
him
in
that
one
rude
foolish
unnecessary
question
are
you
goin
to
propose
too
she
had
outraged
common
courtesy
and
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
say
even
a
friendly
good
bye
to
her
she
did
not
realise
the
full
measure
of
the
insult
until
afterwards
she
had
practically
insinuated
that
he
was
following
the
somewhat
sordid
example
of
cousin
alaric
and
montgomery
hawkes
in
proposing
for
her
hand
because
in
a
few
years
she
would
benefit
by
her
uncle
will
such
a
suggestion
was
not
only
unworthy
of
her
it
was
an
unforgivable
thing
to
say
to
him
he
had
always
treated
her
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
consideration
and
because
he
did
not
flaunt
his
gentility
before
her
she
had
taken
unwarranted
umbrage
and
had
said
something
that
raised
an
impassable
barrier
between
them
all
the
way
across
the
atlantic
poor
lonely
peg
had
many
opportunities
of
reviewing
that
brief
glimpse
of
english
life
she
felt
now
how
wrong
her
attitude
had
been
to
the
whole
of
the
chichester
family
she
had
judged
them
at
first
sight
she
had
resolved
that
they
were
just
selfish
inconsiderate
characterless
people
on
reflection
she
determined
that
they
were
not
and
even
if
they
had
been
why
should
peg
have
been
their
accuser
and
after
all
is
there
not
an
element
of
selfishness
in
every
nature
was
peg
herself
entirely
immune
and
in
a
family
with
traditions
to
look
back
on
and
live
up
to
have
they
not
a
greater
right
to
being
than
the
plebeian
with
nothing
to
look
back
on
or
forward
to
and
all
things
considered
is
not
selfishness
a
thoroughly
human
and
entirely
natural
feeling
what
right
had
she
to
condemn
people
wholesale
for
feeling
and
practising
it
these
were
the
sum
and
substance
of
peg
during
the
first
days
of
her
voyage
home
then
the
thought
came
to
her
were
the
chichesters
really
selfish
now
that
she
had
been
told
the
situation
she
knew
that
her
aunt
had
undertaken
her
training
to
protect
ethel
and
alaric
from
distress
and
humiliation
she
realised
how
distasteful
it
must
have
been
to
a
lady
of
chichester
nature
and
position
to
have
occasion
to
receive
into
her
house
amongst
her
own
family
such
a
girl
as
peg
and
she
had
not
made
it
easy
for
her
aunt
she
had
regarded
the
family
as
being
allied
against
her
was
it
not
largely
her
own
fault
if
they
had
been
peg
sense
of
justice
was
asserting
itself
the
thought
of
alaric
flashed
through
her
mind
and
with
it
came
a
little
pang
of
regret
for
the
many
occasions
she
had
made
fun
of
him
and
in
his
mother
presence
his
proposal
to
her
had
its
pathetic
as
well
as
its
humorous
side
to
save
his
family
he
would
have
deliberately
thrown
away
his
own
chance
of
happiness
by
marrying
her
yet
he
would
have
done
it
willingly
and
cheerfully
and
from
what
she
had
seen
of
the
little
man
he
would
have
lived
up
to
his
obligations
honourably
and
without
a
murmur
alaric
sense
of
relief
at
her
refusal
of
him
suddenly
passed
before
her
and
she
smiled
broadly
as
she
saw
in
a
mental
picture
his
eager
and
radiant
little
face
as
he
thanked
her
profusely
for
being
so
generous
as
to
refuse
him
looking
back
alaric
was
by
no
means
as
contemptible
as
he
had
appeared
at
first
sight
he
had
been
coddled
too
much
he
needed
the
spur
of
adversity
and
the
light
of
battle
with
his
fellowmen
experience
and
worldly
wisdom
could
make
him
a
useful
and
worthy
citizen
since
fundamentally
there
was
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
him
peg
outlook
on
life
was
distinctly
becoming
clarifled
lastly
she
thought
of
ethel
poor
unhappy
lonely
ethel
in
her
little
narrow
ignorance
peg
had
taken
an
intense
dislike
to
her
cousin
from
the
beginning
once
or
twice
she
had
made
friendly
overtures
to
ethel
and
had
always
been
repulsed
she
placed
ethel
in
the
category
of
selfish
that
she
had
heard
and
read
about
and
now
apparently
met
face
to
face
then
came
the
vivid
experience
at
night
when
ethel
laid
bare
her
soul
pitilessly
and
torrentially
for
peg
to
see
with
it
came
the
realisation
of
the
and
misery
of
this
outwardly
contented
and
entirely
unemotional
young
lady
beneath
the
veneer
of
repression
and
convention
peg
saw
the
fires
of
passion
blazing
in
ethel
and
the
cry
of
revolt
and
hatred
against
her
environment
but
for
peg
she
would
have
thrown
away
her
life
on
a
creature
such
as
brent
because
there
was
no
one
near
her
to
understand
and
to
pity
and
to
succour
peg
shuddered
as
she
thought
of
the
rash
act
ethel
had
been
saved
from
blackening
her
life
in
the
company
of
that
satyr
how
many
thousands
of
girls
were
there
in
england
today
skilled
in
the
masonry
of
society
to
all
outward
seeming
perfectly
contented
awaiting
their
final
summons
to
the
the
culmination
of
their
brief
inglorious
careers
yet
if
one
could
penetrate
beneath
the
apparent
calm
one
might
find
boiling
in
their
blood
and
beating
in
their
brains
the
same
revolt
that
had
driven
ethel
to
the
verge
of
the
dead
sea
of
lost
hopes
and
vain
ambitions
the
vortex
of
scandal
when
from
time
to
time
a
girl
of
breeding
and
of
family
elopes
with
an
or
a
chauffeur
the
unfortunate
incident
is
hushed
up
and
the
parents
attribute
the
unhappy
occurrence
primarily
to
some
mental
or
moral
twist
in
the
young
lady
they
should
seek
the
fault
in
their
own
hearts
and
lives
it
is
the
home
life
of
england
that
is
responsible
for
a
large
portion
of
the
misery
that
drives
the
victims
to
open
revolt
the
children
are
not
taught
from
the
time
they
can
first
speak
to
be
perfectly
frank
and
honest
about
everything
they
think
and
feel
they
are
too
often
left
in
the
care
of
servants
at
an
age
when
parental
influence
has
the
greatest
significance
on
the
rare
occasions
when
they
are
permitted
to
enter
the
august
presence
of
their
parents
they
are
often
treated
with
a
combination
of
tolerant
affection
and
imperial
severity
small
wonder
the
little
ones
in
their
development
to
adolescence
evade
giving
confidences
that
have
neither
been
asked
for
nor
encouraged
they
have
to
learn
the
great
secrets
of
life
and
of
nature
from
either
bitter
experience
or
from
the
lips
of
strangers
children
and
parents
grow
up
apart
it
often
takes
a
convulsion
of
nature
or
a
devastating
scandal
to
awaken
the
latter
to
the
full
realisation
of
their
responsibility
during
their
talk
the
morning
following
that
illuminating
incident
peg
learned
more
of
ethel
real
nature
than
she
had
done
in
all
of
the
four
weeks
she
had
seen
and
listened
to
her
daily
she
had
opened
her
heart
to
peg
and
the
two
girls
had
mingled
confidences
if
they
had
only
begun
that
way
what
a
different
month
it
might
have
been
for
both
peg
resolved
to
watch
ethel
career
from
afar
to
write
to
her
constantly
and
to
keep
fresh
and
green
the
memory
of
their
mutual
regard
at
times
there
would
flash
through
peg
mind
what
would
her
future
in
america
be
with
her
father
would
he
be
disappointed
he
so
much
wanted
her
to
be
provided
for
that
the
outcome
of
her
visit
abroad
would
be
of
a
certainty
in
the
nature
of
a
severe
shock
to
him
what
would
be
the
outcome
how
would
he
receive
her
and
what
had
all
the
days
to
come
in
store
for
her
with
memory
searching
back
to
the
days
that
were
she
had
a
longing
now
for
education
to
know
the
essential
things
that
made
daily
intercourse
possible
between
people
of
culture
she
had
been
accustomed
to
look
on
it
as
affectation
now
she
realised
that
it
was
as
natural
to
those
who
had
acquired
the
masonry
of
gentle
people
as
her
soft
brogue
and
odd
blunt
outspoken
ways
were
to
her
from
now
on
she
would
never
more
be
satisfied
with
life
as
it
was
of
old
she
had
passed
through
a
period
of
awakening
a
searchlight
had
been
turned
on
her
own
shortcomings
and
lack
of
advantages
she
had
not
been
conscious
of
them
before
since
she
had
been
law
unto
herself
but
now
a
new
note
beat
in
on
her
it
was
as
though
she
had
been
and
suddenly
had
the
power
of
vouchsafed
her
and
looked
out
on
a
world
that
dazzled
by
its
brilliancy
it
was
even
as
though
she
had
been
and
by
a
miracle
had
the
gift
of
sweet
sounds
given
her
and
found
herself
bathed
in
a
flow
of
sweet
music
she
was
bewildered
her
view
of
life
had
changed
she
would
have
to
rearrange
her
outlook
by
her
experience
if
she
hoped
to
find
happiness
and
always
as
she
brooded
and
argued
with
and
criticised
herself
and
found
things
to
admire
in
what
had
hitherto
been
wrong
to
her
always
the
face
of
jerry
rose
before
her
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
came
pleasantly
to
her
ears
and
the
memory
of
his
regard
touched
gently
at
her
heart
and
the
thought
of
her
final
mistake
burnt
and
throbbed
in
her
brain
and
with
each
pulsation
of
the
giant
engines
she
was
carried
farther
and
farther
away
froze
the
scene
of
her
first
romance
one
night
she
made
her
farewell
to
england
and
all
it
contained
that
had
played
a
part
in
her
life
it
was
the
night
before
she
reached
new
york
as
she
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
america
the
thought
of
one
who
was
waiting
for
her
who
had
never
shown
anger
or
resentment
toward
her
whatever
she
did
who
had
never
shown
liking
for
any
but
her
who
had
always
given
her
the
love
of
his
heart
and
the
fruit
of
his
brain
who
had
sheltered
and
taught
and
loved
and
suffered
for
her
rose
insistently
before
her
and
obliterated
all
other
impressions
and
all
other
memories
as
she
spoke
her
farewell
to
england
peg
turned
her
little
body
toward
the
quickly
nearing
shores
of
america
and
thanked
god
that
waiting
to
greet
her
would
be
her
father
and
entreated
him
that
he
would
be
spared
to
her
and
that
when
either
should
die
that
she
might
be
called
first
that
life
without
him
would
be
barren
and
terrible
and
above
all
she
pleaded
that
he
would
keep
her
little
heart
loyal
always
to
her
childhood
hero
and
that
no
other
should
ever
supplant
her
father
in
her
love
and
remembrance
when
she
awoke
nest
day
amid
the
bustle
of
the
last
morning
on
board
it
seemed
that
her
prayer
had
been
answered
her
farewell
to
england
was
indeed
final
she
had
only
one
thought
uppermost
she
was
going
to
see
her
father
book
v
peg
returns
to
her
father
chapter
i
after
many
days
frank
stood
on
the
quay
that
morning
in
july
and
watched
the
great
ship
slowly
swing
in
through
the
heads
and
his
heart
beat
fast
as
he
waited
impatiently
while
they
moored
her
his
little
one
had
come
back
to
him
his
fears
were
at
rest
she
was
on
board
that
floating
mass
of
steel
and
iron
and
the
giant
queen
of
the
water
had
gallantly
survived
storm
and
wave
and
was
nestling
alongside
the
pier
would
she
be
the
same
peg
that
was
the
thought
beating
through
him
as
he
strained
his
eyes
to
see
the
familiar
and
beloved
little
figure
was
she
coming
back
to
him
transformed
by
the
magic
wand
of
association
a
great
lady
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
she
would
yet
he
had
a
fear
in
his
soul
that
she
might
not
be
the
same
one
thing
he
made
up
his
mind
to
never
again
would
he
think
of
separation
never
again
would
he
argue
her
into
agreeing
to
go
away
from
him
he
had
learned
his
lesson
and
by
bitter
experience
never
again
until
she
wished
it
amid
the
throngs
swarming
down
the
gangways
he
suddenly
saw
his
daughter
and
he
gave
a
little
gasp
of
surprised
pleasure
and
a
mist
swam
before
his
eyes
and
a
great
lump
came
into
his
throat
and
his
heart
beat
as
a
it
was
the
same
peg
that
had
gone
away
a
month
ago
the
same
little
black
suit
and
the
hat
with
the
berries
and
the
same
bag
and
michael
in
her
arms
their
meeting
was
extraordinary
it
was
quite
unlike
what
either
had
supposed
it
would
be
there
was
a
note
of
strangeness
in
each
there
was
added
to
the
fulness
of
the
heart
an
aloofness
a
feeling
that
in
the
passage
of
time
life
had
not
left
either
quite
the
same
how
often
that
happens
to
two
people
who
have
shared
the
intimacy
of
years
and
the
affection
of
a
lifetime
after
a
separation
of
even
a
little
while
the
break
in
their
the
influence
of
strangers
and
the
quick
rush
of
circumstance
during
their
parting
creates
a
feeling
neither
had
ever
known
the
interregnum
had
created
barriers
that
had
to
be
broken
down
before
the
old
relationship
could
be
resumed
and
peg
made
the
journey
home
almost
in
silence
they
sat
hand
in
hand
in
the
conveyance
whilst
peg
eyes
looked
at
the
tall
buildings
as
they
flashed
past
her
and
saw
the
daring
advertisements
on
the
boardings
and
listened
to
the
ceaseless
roar
of
the
traffic
all
was
just
as
she
had
left
it
only
peg
had
changed
new
york
seemed
a
babel
after
the
quiet
of
that
little
north
of
england
home
she
shivered
as
thoughts
surged
in
a
jumbled
mass
through
her
brain
they
reached
apartment
it
had
been
made
brilliant
for
peg
return
there
were
additions
to
the
meagre
furnishings
peg
had
left
behind
fresh
pictures
were
on
the
walls
there
were
flowers
everywhere
watched
peg
anxiously
as
she
looked
around
how
would
she
feel
toward
her
home
when
she
contrasted
it
with
what
she
had
just
left
his
heart
bounded
as
he
saw
peg
face
brighten
as
she
ran
from
one
object
to
another
and
commented
on
them
it
the
grand
furniture
we
have
now
father
do
ye
like
it
peg

he
looked
at
her
and
a
whimsical
note
came
in
his
voice
and
the
old
look
twinkled
in
his
eyes
it
english

thought

he
raised
the
littered
sheets
of
his
manuscript
and
showed
them
to
her
this
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
read
from
to
organisation
the
history
of
a
generation
of
english
misrule
by
frank
owen

proudly
at
her
father

she
made
him
comfortable
as
had
been
her
wont
before
and
sitting
on
the
little
low
stool
at
his
feet
she
told
him
the
story
of
her
month
abroad
and
the
impelling
motive
of
her
return
she
softened
some
things
and
omitted
others
ethel
entirely
that
episode
should
be
locked
forever
in
peg
heart
jerry
she
touched
on
lightly
asked
her
many
questions
about
him
remembering
the
tone
of
her
later
letters
and
all
the
time
he
never
took
his
eyes
from
her
face
and
he
marked
how
it
shone
with
a
warm
glow
of
pleasure
when
jerry
name
occurred
and
how
the
gleam
died
away
and
settled
into
one
of
sadness
when
she
spoke
of
her
discovery
that
he
had
a
title
they
queer
people
the
english
peg
they
are
father

time

the
proverb

taught

as
a
child
which
wun
father
i
know
a
hundred
so
i
do
the
head
of
a
bull
the
heels
of
a
horse
of
the
smile
of
an
englishman
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
keenly
do

remember
that
peg
i
do
there
are
englishmen
and
englishmen

plenty
o
bad

token

that
they

to
already
sure
there
a
man
named
plunkett

done
more
in
a
few
years
than
all
the
governments
have
accomplished
in
all
the
years
they
been
blunderin
along
tryin
to
thrample
on
us

he
said
that
so
long
as

english
government

to
kindly
honourable
men
like
plunkett
there
was
hope
of

a
happy
contented
people

the
little
fine
things

irish
have
got
to
learn
an
they
make
life
seem
so
much
bigger
an
grander
by
bein
considerate
an
civil
an
to
each
other
we
let
the
brutality
of
all
the
years
that
have
gone
before
eat
into
us
and
we
have
thrown
off
all
the
charm
and
formality
of
life
and
in
their
place
adopted
a
rough
and
crude
manner
to
each
other
that
does
not
come
really
from
our
hearts
but
from
the
memory
of
our
wrongs
unconsciously
peg
had
spoken
as
she
had
heard
jerry
so
often
speak
when
he
discussed
the
irish
she
had
lowered
her
voice
and
concluded
with
quiet
strength
and
dignity
the
contrast
to
the
beginning
of
the
speech
was
electrical
listened
amazed
did
the
same
jerry
say
that
he
did
father
an
much
more

knows
ireland
well
an
loves

many
of
his
best
friends

to
be
a
lord

betther
than

it
in
their
manner
that
they
have
the
advantage
of
us
and
where

be
gettin
the
manner
of
a
lord
when
me

poorest
peasant
in
the
village

more
to
me
than
any
man

in
england
he
drew
her
gently
to
him
there
the
one
great
danger
of
two
people
who
have
grown
near
to
each
other
separatin
when
they
meet
again

each
think
the
other
has
changed

at
each
other
with
different
eyes

what

all
i

twenty
years

that
was
why
i
urged

to
go
to
england
on
the
bounty
of
yer
uncle
i
wanted
ye
to
know
there
was
another
kind
of
a
life
where
the
days
flowed
along
without
a
care
or
a
sorrow
where
poverty
was
but
a
word
an
misery
had
no
place
an
ye
seen
it
peg
an
the
whole
wurrld

in
judgment

the
dead
and
gone
days
of
yer
youth
an
in
judgment

ye
sayin
to
me

in
judgment
on
you
what
do
ye
think
i
become
let
me
tell
ye
i
come
back
to
ye
a
thousand
times
more
yer
child
than
i
was
when
i
left
ye
what
i
gone
through
has
only
strengthened
me
love
for
ye
and
me
reverence
for
yer
work

have
changed
but
do
we
all
change
day
by
day
even
as
we
pass
them
close
to
each
other
an
if
the
change
is
for
the
betther
where
the
harm
i
have
changed
father
there
somethin
wakened
in
me

a
woman

brought
ye
back
instead

girl

left
an
it
the
woman

by
ye
father
even
as
the
child

when
i
depended
on
ye
for
every
little
thing
there
no
power
in
the
wurrld
ever
separate
us
she
clung
to
him
hysterically
even
while
she
protested
the
most
he
felt
the
strange
new
note
in
her
life
he
held
her
firmly
and
looked
into
her
eyes
there
one
thing
peg
that
must
part
us
some
day
when
it
comes
to
you
what
that
father
love
peg
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
said
nothing
has
it
come
has
it
peg
she
buried
her
face
on
his
breast
and
though
no
sound
came
he
knew
by
the
trembling
of
her
little
body
that
she
was
crying
so
it
had
come
into
her
life
the
child
he
had
sent
away
a
month
ago
had
come
back
to
him
transformed
in
that
little
time
into
a
woman
the
cry
of
youth
and
the
call
of
life
had
reached
her
heart
chapter
ii
looking
backward
that
night
peg
and
her
father
faced
the
future
they
argued
out
all
it
might
mean
they
would
fight
it
together
it
was
a
pathetic
wistful
little
peg
that
came
back
to
him
and
set
himself
the
task
of
lifting
something
of
the
load
that
lay
on
his
child
heart
after
all
he
reasoned
with
her
with
all
his
gentility
and
his
advantages
to
have
allowed
peg
to
like
him
and
then
to
deliberately
hurt
her
at
the
end
just
as
she
was
leaving
for
a
fancied
insult
did
not
augur
well
for
the
character
of
jerry
he
tried
to
laugh
her
out
of
her
mood
he
chided
her
for
joking
with
an
englishman
at
a
critical
moment
such
as
their

made
some
little
money
out
of

they

and

their
lives
there
and
it
was

a
wonderful
ireland

best
of
the
old
and
ceaseless
energy
of
the
new
an
ireland
worth

in
they

make
their
home
there

time

some
day

there
once
it

there
yer
mother

me

married
it
was
there
she
gave
her
life
into
me
care
he
became
suddenly
silent
and
the
light
of
memory
shone
in
his
eyes
and
the
sigh
of
broke
through
his
lips
and
his
thoughts
stretched
back
through
the
years
and
once
again
angela
was
beside
him
peg
saw
the
look
and
knew
it
she
kept
quite
still
then
as
of
old
when
her
father
was
in
trouble
she
did
as
she
was
wont
in
those
days
she
slipped
her
little
hand
into
his
and
waited
for
him
to
break
the
silence
after
a
while
he
stood
up
ye
betther
be
goin
to
bed
peg
all
right
father
she
went
to
the
door
then
she
stopped
ye
glad
i
home
father
he
pressed
her
closely
to
him
for
answer
i
never
lave
ye
again
she
whispered
all
through
the
night
peg
lay
awake
searching
through
the
past
and
trying
to
pierce
through
the
future
toward
morning
she
slept
and
in
a
whirling
dream
she
saw
a
body
floating
down
a
stream
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
grasp
it
when
the
eyes
met
hers
and
the
eyes
were
those
of
a
dead
man
and
the
man
was
jerry
she
woke
trembling
with
fear
and
she
turned
on
the
light
and
huddled
into
a
chair
and
sat
chattering
with
terror
until
she
heard
her
father
moving
in
his
room
she
went
to
the
door
and
asked
him
to
let
her
go
in
to
him
he
opened
the
door
and
saw
his
little
peg
wild
eyed
pale
and
standing
on
the
threshold
the
look
in
her
eyes
terrified
him
what
is
it
peg
me
darlin
what
is
it
she
crept
in
and
looked
up
into
his
face
with
her
startling
gaze
and
she
grasped
him
with
both
of
her
small
hands
and
in
a
voice
dull
and
hopeless
cried
despairingly
i
dreamt
he
was
dead
dead
and
i
could
rache
him
an
he
went
on
past
me
down
the
stream
with
his
face
the
grasp
loosened
and
just
as
she
slipped
from
him
caught
her
in
his
strong
arms
and
placed
her
gently
on
the
sofa
and
tended
her
until
her
eyes
opened
again
and
looked
up
at
him
it
was
the
first
time
his
peg
had
fainted
she
had
indeed
come
back
to
him
changed
he
reproached
himself
bitterly
why
had
he
insisted
on
her
going
she
had
a
sorrow
at
her
heart
now
that
no
hand
could
heal
not
even
his
time
only
could
soften
her
grief
time
and
chapter
iii
an
unexpected
visitor
those
first
days
following
peg
return
found
father
and
child
nearer
each
other
than
they
had
been
since
that
famous
trip
through
ireland
when
he
lectured
from
the
back
of
his
historical
cart
she
became
amanuensis
during
the
day
she
would
go
from
library
to
library
in
new
york
verifying
data
for
her
monumental
work
at
night
he
would
dictate
and
she
would
write
took
a
newer
and
more
vital
interest
in
the
book
and
it
advanced
rapidly
toward
completion
it
was
a
significant
moment
to
introduce
it
since
the
eyes
of
the
world
were
turned
on
the
outcome
of
the
new
measure
for
home
rule
for
ireland
that
asquith
government
were
introducing
and
that
appeared
to
have
every
chance
of
becoming
law
the
dream
of
so
many
irishmen
seemed
to
be
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
of
becoming
a
forceful
reality
accordingly
strained
every
nerve
to
complete
it
he
reviewed
the
past
he
dwelt
on
the
present
he
attempted
to
forecast
the
future
and
with
every
new
page
that
he
completed
he
felt
it
was
one
more
step
nearer
home
the
home
he
was
hoping
for
and
building
on
for
peg
in
ireland
there
the
colour
would
come
back
to
her
cheeks
the
light
to
her
eyes
and
the
flash
of
merriment
to
her
tongue
she
rarely
smiled
now
and
the
pallor
was
always
in
her
cheeks
and
wan
circles
pencilled
around
her
eyes
spoke
of
hard
working
days
and
restless
nights
she
no
longer
spoke
of
england
he
wise
in
his
generation
never
referred
to
it
all
her
interest
seemed
to
be
centred
in
his
book
it
was
a
strange
metamorphosis
for
peg
this
writing
at
dictation
correcting
her
orthography
becoming
familiar
with
historical
facts
and
hunting
through
bookshelves
for
the
actual
occurrences
during
a
certain
period
and
she
found
a
certain
happiness
in
doing
it
was
it
not
for
her
father
and
was
she
not
improving
herself
already
she
would
not
be
at
such
a
disadvantage
as
a
month
ago
with
people
the
thought
gratified
her
she
had
two
letters
from
ethel
the
first
a
simple
direct
one
of
gratitude
and
of
regret
gratitude
for
peg
kindness
and
loyalty
to
her
and
regret
that
peg
had
left
them
the
second
told
of
a
trip
she
was
about
to
make
to
norway
with
some
friends
they
were
going
to
close
the
house
in
scarboro
and
return
to
london
early
in
september
alaric
had
decided
to
follow
his
father
vocation
and
go
to
the
bar
the
following
autumn
they
would
settle
permanently
in
london
while
alaric
ate
his
qualifying
dinners
and
addressed
himself
to
making
his
career
of
brent
she
wrote
nothing
that
incident
was
apparently
closed
she
ended
her
letter
with
the
warmest
expressions
of
regard
and
affection
for
peg
and
the
hope
that
some
day
they
would
meet
again
and
renew
their
intimacy
the
arrival
of
these
letters
and
her
daily
for
her
father
were
the
only
incidents
in
her
even
life
one
evening
some
few
weeks
after
her
return
she
was
in
her
room
preparing
to
begin
her
night
work
with
her
father
when
she
heard
the
bell
ring
that
was
unusual
their
callers
were
few
she
heard
the
outer
door
open
then
the
sound
of
a
distant
voice
mingling
with
her
father
then
came
a
knock
at
her
door
there
somebody
outside
here
to
see
ye
peg
said
her
father
who
is
it
father
a
perfect
sthranger
to
me
be
quick
now
she
heard
her
father
footsteps
go
into
the
little
and
then
the
hum
of
voices
without
any
apparent
reason
she
suddenly
felt
a
tenseness
and
nervousness
she
walked
out
of
her
room
and
paused
a
moment
outside
the
closed
door
of
the
and
listened
her
father
was
talking
she
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
a
tall
bronzed
man
came
forward
to
greet
her
her
heart
almost
stopped
she
trembled
violently
the
next
moment
jerry
had
clasped
her
hand
in
both
of
his
how
are
you
peg
he
smiled
down
at
her
as
he
used
to
in
regal
villa
and
behind
the
smile
there
was
a
grave
look
in
his
dark
eyes
and
the
old
tone
of
tenderness
in
his
voice
how
are
you
peg
he
repeated
i
fine
jerry
she
replied
in
a
daze
then
she
looked
at
and
she
hurried
on
to
say
this
is
my
father
sir
gerald
adair
we
inthroduced
ourselves
already
said
eyeing
the
unexpected
visitor
all
the
while
and
what
might
ye
be
doin
in
new
york
he
asked
i
have
never
seen
america
i
take
an
englishman
interest
in
what
we
once
owned
and
lost
thro
misgovernment
well
we
say
misunderstanding
as
they
one
day
lose
ireland
i
hope
not
the
two
countries
understand
each
other
better
every
day
it
taken
centuries
to
do
it
the
more
lasting
will
be
the
union
as
peg
watched
jerry
she
was
wondering
all
the
time
why
he
was
there
this
quiet
undemonstrative
unemotional
man
why
the
bell
rang
again
peg
started
to
go
but
stopped
her
it
mcginnis
this
is
his
night
to
call
and
tell
me
the
politics
of
the
town
i
take
him
into
the
next
room
peg
until
yer
visitor
is
gone
oh
please
said
jerry
hurriedly
and
taking
a
step
toward
the
door
allow
me
to
call
some
other
time
stay
where
ye
are
cried
hurrying
out
as
the
bell
rang
again
peg
and
jerry
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
then
she
lowered
her
eyes
i
want
to
ask
ye
something
sir
gerald
she
began
jerry
he
corrected
please
forgive
me
for
what
i
said
to
ye
that
day
it
was
wrong
of
me
to
say
it
yet
it
was
just
what
ye
might
have
expected
from
me
but
ye
been
so
fine
to
me
a
little
nobody
all
that
wonderful
month
that
it
hurt
me
ever
since
and
i
did
dare
write
to
ye
it
would
have
looked
like
presumption
from
me
but
now
that
ye
come
here
found
me
out
and
i
want
to
ask
yer
pardon
an
i
want
to
ask
ye
not
to
be
angry
with
me
i
could
be
angry
with
you
peg
he
paused
and
as
he
looked
at
her
the
reserve
of
the
man
was
broken
he
bent
over
her
and
said
softly
peg
i
love
you
a
cry
welled
up
from
peg
heart
to
her
lips
and
was
stifled
the
room
swam
around
her
was
all
her
misery
to
end
did
this
man
come
back
from
the
mists
of
memory
because
he
loved
her
she
tried
to
speak
but
nothing
came
from
her
parched
lips
and
tightened
throat
then
she
became
conscious
that
he
was
speaking
again
and
she
listened
to
him
with
all
her
senses
with
all
her
heart
and
from
her
soul
i
knew
you
would
never
write
to
me
and
somehow
i
wondered
just
how
much
you
cared
for
me
if
at
all
so
i
came
here
i
love
you
peg
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
i
want
to
care
for
you
and
tend
you
and
make
you
happy
i
love
you
her
heart
leaped
and
strained
the
blood
surged
to
her
temples
do
you
love
me
she
whispered
and
her
voice
trembled
and
broke
i
do
indeed
i
do
be
my
wife
but
you
have
a
title
she
pleaded
share
it
with
me
he
replied
ye
be
so
ashamed
o
me
ye
would
no
peg
i
be
proud
of
you
i
love
you
peg
unable
to
argue
or
plead
or
strive
against
what
her
heart
yearned
for
the
most
broke
down
and
sobbed
as
she
murmured
i
love
you
too
mister
jerry
in
a
moment
she
was
in
his
arms
it
was
the
first
time
anyone
had
touched
her
tenderly
besides
her
father
all
her
sturdy
boyish
ruggedness
shrank
from
any
display
of
affection
just
for
a
moment
it
did
now
then
she
slowly
yielded
herself
but
jerry
stroked
her
hair
and
looked
into
her
eyes
and
smiled
down
at
her
lovingly
as
he
asked
what
will
your
father
say
she
looked
happily
up
at
him
and
answered
do
you
know
one
of
the
first
things
me
father
taught
me
when
i
was
just
a
little
child
tell
me
it
was
from
tom
moore
there
nothin
half
so
sweet
in
life
as
love
young
dream
when
came
into
the
room
later
he
realised
that
the
great
summons
had
come
to
his
little
girl
he
felt
a
dull
pain
at
his
heart
but
only
for
a
moment
the
thought
came
to
him
that
he
was
about
to
give
to
england
his
daughter
in
marriage
well
had
he
not
taken
from
the
english
one
of
her
fairest
daughters
as
his
wife
and
a
silent
prayer
went
up
from
his
heart
that
happiness
would
abide
with
his
peg
and
her
and
that
their
romance
would
last
longer
than
had
angela
and
his
afterword
and
now
the
moment
has
come
to
take
leave
of
the
people
i
have
lived
with
for
so
long
yet
though
i
say
adieu
i
feel
it
is
only
a
temporary
their
lives
are
so
linked
with
mine
that
some
day
in
the
future
i
may
be
tempted
to
draw
back
the
curtain
and
show
the
passage
of
years
in
their
various
lives
simultaneously
with
the
of
the
home
rule
bill
passing
through
the
english
house
of
commons
published
his
book
setting
down
clearly
without
passion
or
prejudice
the
actual
facts
of
the
ancient
and
modern
struggle
for
ireland
freedom
and
foreshadowing
the
coming
of
the
new
era
of
prosperity
and
enlightenment
and
education
and
business
integrity
found
himself
hailed
as
a
modern
prophet
he
appealed
to
them
to
beg
no
longer
but
to
cooperate
to
organize
above
all
to
work
and
to
work
consistently
and
intelligently
he
appealed
to
the
irish
working
in
factories
and
and
in
civil
appointments
in
the
great
cities
of
the
world
to
come
back
to
ireland
and
once
again
to
worship
at
the
shrine
of
the
beauty
of
god
country
to
open
their
eyes
and
their
hearts
to
all
the
light
and
glory
and
wonder
which
god
gives
to
the
marvellous
world
he
has
made
for
humanity
to
see
the
dawn
mountain
and
lake
scent
the
grass
and
the
incense
of
the
flowers
and

dawn
of
the
new

begun
to
shed
its
light
over
the
country

bring
irishmen
from
the
farthest
limits
of
the
world

drove
them
away
in
the
bitter
time
of
blood
and
strife
and
ignorance

her
to
all
whose
influence
on
