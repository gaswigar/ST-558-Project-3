them

nothing
more
generally
or
more
recurrently
solicits
us
in
the
light
of
literature
i
think
than
the
interest
of
our
learning
how
the
poet
the
true
poet
and
above
all
the
particular
one
with
whom
we
may
for
the
moment
be
concerned
has
come
into
his
estate
asserted
and
preserved
his
identity
worked
out
his
question
of
sticking
to
that
and
to
nothing
else
and
has
so
been
able
to
reach
us
and
touch
us
a
poet
in
spite
of
the
accidents
and
dangers
that
must
have
beset
this
course
the
chances
and
changes
the
personal
history
of
any
absolute
genius
draw
us
to
watch
his
adventure
with
curiosity
and
inquiry
lead
us
on
to
win
more
of
his
secret
and
borrow
more
of
his
experience
i
mean
needless
to
say
when
we
are
at
all
critically
minded
but
there
is
something
in
the
clear
safe
arrival
of
the
poetic
nature
in
a
given
case
at
the
point
of
its
free
and
happy
exercise
that
provokes
if
not
the
cold
impulse
to
challenge
or
it
at
least
the
need
of
understanding
so
far
as
possible
how
in
a
world
in
which
difficulty
and
disaster
are
frequent
the
most
wavering
and
flickering
of
all
fine
flames
has
escaped
extinction
we
go
back
we
help
ourselves
to
hang
about
the
attestation
of
the
first
spark
of
the
flame
and
like
to
indulge
in
a
fond
notation
of
such
facts
as
that
of
the
air
in
which
it
was
kindled
and
insisted
on
proceeding
or
yet
perhaps
failed
to
proceed
to
a
larger
combustion
and
the
draughts
blowing
about
the
world
that
were
either
as
may
have
happened
to
quicken
its
native
force
or
perhaps
to
extinguish
it
in
a
gust
of
undue
violence
it
is
naturally
when
the
poet
has
emerged
unmistakeably
clear
or
has
at
a
happy
moment
of
his
story
seemed
likely
to
that
our
attention
and
our
suspense
in
the
matter
are
most
intimately
engaged
and
we
are
at
any
rate
in
general
beset
by
the
impression
and
haunted
by
the
observed
law
that
the
growth
and
the
triumph
of
the
faculty
at
its
finest
have
been
positively
in
proportion
to
certain
rigours
of
circumstance
it
is
doubtless
not
indeed
so
much
that
this
appearance
has
been
inveterate
as
that
the
quality
of
genius
in
fact
associated
with
it
is
apt
to
strike
us
as
the
clearest
we
know
we
think
of
dante
in
harassed
exile
of
shakespeare
under
sordidly
professional
stress
of
milton
in
exasperated
exposure
and
material
darkness
we
think
of
burns
and
chatterton
and
keats
and
shelley
and
coleridge
we
think
of
leopardi
and
musset
and
emily
bronte
and
walt
whitman
as
it
is
open
to
us
surely
to
think
even
of
wordsworth
so
harshly
conditioned
by
his
spareness
and
bareness
and
bleakness
all
this
in
reference
to
the
voices
that
have
most
proved
their
command
of
the
ear
of
time
and
with
the
various
examples
added
of
those
claiming
or
at
best
enjoying
but
the
slighter
attention
and
their
office
thus
mainly
affects
us
as
that
of
showing
in
how
jostled
how
frequently
arrested
and
all
but
defeated
a
hand
the
torch
could
still
be
carried
it
is
not
of
course
for
the
countrymen
of
byron
and
of
tennyson
and
swinburne
any
more
than
for
those
of
victor
hugo
to
say
nothing
of
those
of
edmond
rostand
to
forget
the
occurrence
on
occasion
of
high
instances
in
which
the
dangers
all
seem
denied
and
only
favour
and
facility
recorded
but
it
would
take
more
of
these
than
we
can
begin
to
set
in
a
row
to
purge
us
of
that
prime
determinant
after
all
of
our
affection
for
the
great
poetic
muse
the
vision
of
the
rarest
sensibility
and
the
largest
generosity
we
know
kept
by
her
at
their
pitch
kept
fighting
for
their
life
and
insisting
on
their
range
of
expression
amid
doubts
and
derisions
and
buffets
even
sometimes
amid
stones
of
stumbling
quite
that
might
at
any
moment
have
made
the
loss
of
the
precious
clue
really
irremediable
which
moral
so
pointed
accounts
assuredly
for
half
our
interest
in
the
poetic
character
a
sentiment
more
unlikely
than
not
i
think
to
survive
a
sustained
succession
of
victor
hugos
and
rostands
or
of
byrons
tennysons
and
swinburnes
we
quite
consciously
miss
in
these
bards
as
we
find
ourselves
rather
wondering
even
at
our
failure
to
miss
it
in
shelley
that
such
complications
as
they
may
have
had
to
reckon
with
were
not
in
general
of
the
cruelly
troublous
order
and
that
no
stretch
of
the
view
either
of
our
own
theory
of
art
or
of
our
vivacity
of
passion
as
making
trouble
contributes
perceptibly
the
required
savour
of
the
pathetic
we
cling
critically
or
at
least
experientially
speaking
to
our
superstition
if
not
absolutely
to
our
approved
measure
of
this
grace
and
proof
and
that
truly
to
cut
my
argument
short
is
what
sets
us
straight
down
before
a
sudden
case
in
which
the
old
discrimination
quite
drops
to
the
ground
in
which
we
neither
on
the
one
hand
miss
anything
that
the
general
association
could
have
given
it
nor
on
the
other
recognise
the
pomp
that
attends
the
grand
exceptions
i
have
mentioned
rupert
brooke
young
happy
radiant
extraordinarily
endowed
and
irresistibly
attaching
virtually
met
a
soldier
death
met
it
in
the
stress
of
action
and
the
all
but
immediate
presence
of
the
enemy
but
he
is
before
us
as
a
new
a
confounding
and
superseding
example
altogether
an
unprecedented
image
formed
to
resist
erosion
by
time
or
vulgarisation
by
reference
of
quickened
possibilities
finer
ones
than
ever
before
in
the
stuff
poets
may
be
noted
as
made
of
with
twenty
reasons
fixing
the
interest
and
the
charm
that
will
henceforth
abide
in
his
name
and
constitute
as
we
may
say
his
legend
he
submits
all
helplessly
to
one
in
particular
which
is
for
appreciation
the
least
personal
to
him
or
inseparable
from
him
and
he
does
this
because
while
he
is
still
in
the
highest
degree
of
the
distinguished
faculty
and
quality
we
happen
to
feel
him
even
more
markedly
and
significantly
modern
this
is
why
i
speak
of
the
mixture
of
his
elements
as
new
feeling
that
it
governs
his
example
put
by
it
in
a
light
which
nothing
else
could
have
equally
contributed
so
that
byron
for
instance
who
startled
his
contemporaries
by
taking
for
granted
scarce
one
of
the
articles
that
formed
their
comfortable
faith
and
by
revelling
in
almost
everything
that
made
them
idiots
if
he
himself
was
to
figure
as
a
child
of
truth
looks
to
us
by
any
such
measure
comparatively
plated
over
with
the
impenetrable
rococo
of
his
own
day
i
speak
i
hasten
to
add
not
of
byron
volume
his
flood
and
his
fortune
but
of
his
really
having
quarrelled
with
the
temper
and
the
accent
of
his
age
still
more
where
they
might
have
helped
him
to
expression
than
where
he
but
flew
in
their
face
he
hugged
his
pomp
whereas
our
unspeakably
fortunate
young
poet
of
linked
like
him
also
for
consecration
of
the
final
romance
with
the
isles
of
greece
took
for
own
the
whole
of
the
poetic
consciousness
he
was
born
to
and
moved
about
in
it
as
a
stripped
young
swimmer
might
have
kept
splashing
through
blue
water
and
coming
up
at
any
point
that
friendliness
and
fancy
with
every
prejudice
shed
might
determine
rupert
expressed
us
at
the
highest
tide
of
our
actuality
and
was
the
creature
of
a
freedom
restricted
only
by
that
condition
of
his
blinding
youth
which
we
accept
on
the
whole
with
gratitude
and
relief
given
that
i
qualify
the
condition
as
dazzling
even
to
himself
how
can
it
therefore
not
be
interesting
to
see
a
little
what
the
wondrous
modern
in
him
consisted
of
i
what
it
first
and
foremost
really
comes
to
i
think
is
the
fact
that
at
an
hour
when
the
civilised
peoples
are
on
exhibition
quite
finally
and
sharply
on
show
to
each
other
and
to
the
world
as
they
absolutely
never
in
all
their
long
history
have
been
before
the
english
tradition
both
of
amenity
and
of
energy
i
naturally
mean
should
have
flowered
at
once
into
a
specimen
so
beautifully
producible
thousands
of
other
sentiments
are
of
course
all
the
while
in
different
connections
at
hand
for
us
but
it
is
of
the
exquisite
civility
the
social
instincts
of
the
race
expressed
that
i
speak
and
it
would
be
hard
to
overstate
the
felicity
of
his
being
able
just
now
to
say
yes
this
with
the
imperfection
of
so
many
of
our
arrangements
with
the
persistence
of
so
many
of
our
mistakes
with
the
waste
of
so
much
of
our
effort
and
the
weight
of
the
mantle
of
time
that
drags
so
redundantly
about
us
this
natural
accommodation
of
the
english
spirit
this
frequent
extraordinary
beauty
of
the
english
aspect
this
finest
saturation
of
the
english
intelligence
by
its
most
immediate
associations
tasting
as
they
mainly
do
of
the
long
past
this
ideal
image
of
english
youth
in
a
word
at
once
radiant
and
reflective
are
things
that
appeal
to
us
as
delightfully
exhibitional
beyond
a
doubt
yet
as
drawn
to
the
last
fibre
from
the
very
wealth
of
our
own
conscience
and
the
very
force
of
our
own
history
we
have
for
such
an
instance
of
our
genius
to
reach
out
to
strange
places
or
across
other
and
otherwise
productive
tracts
the
exemplary
instance
himself
has
as
a
matter
of
course
reached
and
revelled
for
that
is
exactly
our
way
in
proportion
as
we
feel
ourselves
clear
but
the
kind
of
experience
so
entailed
of
contribution
so
gathered
is
just
what
we
wear
easiest
when
we
have
been
least
stinted
of
it
and
what
our
english
use
of
makes
perhaps
our
vividest
reference
to
our
native
determinants
rupert
brooke
at
any
rate
the
charmed
commentator
may
well
keep
before
him
simply
did
all
the
usual
english
things
under
the
happy
provision
of
course
that
he
found
them
in
his
way
at
their
best
and
it
was
exactly
most
delightful
in
him
that
no
inordinate
expenditure
no
anxious
extension
of
the
common
plan
as
liberally
applied
all
about
him
had
been
incurred
or
contrived
to
predetermine
his
distinction
it
is
difficult
to
express
on
the
contrary
how
peculiar
a
value
attached
to
his
having
simply
come
in
for
the
general
luck
awaiting
any
english
youth
who
may
not
be
markedly
inapt
for
the
traditional
chances
he
could
in
fact
easily
strike
those
who
most
appreciated
him
as
giving
such
an
account
of
the
usual
english
things
to
repeat
the
form
of
my
allusion
to
them
as
seemed
to
address
you
to
them
in
their
very
considerable
number
indeed
for
any
information
about
him
that
might
matter
but
which
left
you
wholly
to
judge
whether
they
seemed
justified
by
their
fruits
this
manner
about
them
as
one
may
call
it
in
general
often
contributes
to
your
impression
that
they
make
for
a
certain
strain
of
related
modesty
which
may
on
occasion
be
one
of
their
happiest
effects
it
at
any
rate
in
days
when
my
acquaintance
with
them
was
slighter
used
to
leave
me
gaping
at
the
treasure
of
operation
the
far
recessional
perspectives
it
took
for
granted
and
any
offered
demonstration
of
the
extent
or
the
mysteries
of
which
seemed
unthinkable
just
in
proportion
as
the
human
resultant
testified
in
some
one
or
other
of
his
odd
ways
to
their
influence
he
might
not
always
be
at
any
rate
on
first
acquaintance
a
resultant
explosively
human
but
there
was
in
any
case
one
reflection
he
could
always
cause
you
to
make
what
a
wondrous
system
it
indeed
must
be
which
insists
on
flourishing
to
all
appearance
under
such
an
absence
of
advertised
or
even
of
confessed
relation
to
it
as
would
do
honour
to
a
vacuum
produced
by
an
the
formulation
the
approximate
expression
of
what
the
system
at
large
might
or
might
do
for
those
in
contact
with
it
became
thus
one
own
fitful
care
with
one
attention
for
a
considerable
period
doubtless
dormant
enough
but
with
the
questions
always
liable
to
revive
before
the
individual
case
rupert
brooke
made
them
revive
as
soon
as
one
began
to
know
him
or
in
other
words
made
one
want
to
read
back
into
him
each
of
his
promoting
causes
without
exception
to
trace
to
some
source
in
the
ambient
air
almost
any
one
at
a
venture
of
his
aspects
so
precious
a
loose
and
careless
bundle
of
happy
references
did
that
inveterate
trick
of
giving
the
to
which
he
shared
with
his
general
kind
fail
to
prevent
your
feeling
sure
of
his
having
about
him
i
think
the
liveliest
interest
of
these
was
that
while
not
one
of
them
was
signally
romantic
by
the
common
measure
of
the
great
english
amenity
they
yet
hung
together
reinforcing
and
enhancing
each
other
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
join
their
hands
for
an
incomparably
educative
or
civilising
process
the
great
mark
of
which
was
that
it
took
some
want
of
amenability
in
particular
subjects
to
betray
anything
like
a
gap
i
do
not
mean
of
course
to
say
that
gaps
and
occasionally
of
the
most
flagrant
were
made
so
supremely
difficult
of
occurrence
but
only
that
the
effect
in
the
human
resultants
who
kept
these
and
with
the
least
effort
most
in
abeyance
was
a
thing
one
would
have
had
different
by
a
single
shade
i
am
not
sure
that
such
a
case
of
the
recognisable
was
the
better
established
by
the
fact
of
rupert
being
one
of
the
three
sons
of
a
at
rugby
where
he
was
born
in
and
where
he
lost
his
father
in
the
elder
of
his
brothers
having
then
already
died
and
the
younger
being
destined
to
fall
in
battle
at
the
allied
front
shortly
after
he
himself
had
succumbed
but
the
circumstance
i
speak
of
gives
a
peculiar
and
an
especially
welcome
consecration
to
that
perceptible
play
in
him
of
the
inbred
public
school
character
the
bloom
of
which
his
short
life
had
too
little
time
to
remove
and
which
one
would
for
the
world
not
have
been
disposed
to
note
with
everything
else
in
the
beautiful
complexity
of
his
attributes
the
fact
was
that
if
one
liked
him
and
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
that
few
young
men
in
our
time
can
have
gone
through
life
under
a
greater
burden
more
easily
carried
and
kept
in
its
place
of
being
liked
one
liked
absolutely
everything
about
him
without
the
smallest
exception
so
that
he
appeared
to
convert
before
one
eyes
all
that
happened
to
him
or
that
had
or
that
ever
might
not
only
to
his
advantage
as
a
source
of
life
and
experience
but
to
the
enjoyment
on
its
own
side
of
a
sort
of
illustrational
virtue
or
glory
this
appearance
of
universal
assimilation
often
indeed
by
incalculable
ironic
reactions
which
were
of
the
very
essence
of
the
restless
young
intelligence
rejoicing
in
its
gaiety
made
each
part
of
his
rich
consciousness
so
rapidly
acquired
cling
as
it
were
to
the
company
of
all
the
other
parts
so
as
at
once
neither
to
miss
any
touch
of
the
luck
one
keeps
coming
back
to
that
incurred
by
them
or
to
let
them
suffer
any
want
of
its
own
rightness
it
was
as
right
through
the
spell
he
cast
altogether
that
he
should
have
come
into
the
world
and
have
passed
his
boyhood
in
that
rugby
home
as
that
he
should
have
been
able
later
on
to
wander
as
irrepressibly
as
the
spirit
moved
him
or
as
that
he
should
have
found
himself
fitting
as
intimately
as
he
was
very
soon
to
do
into
any
number
of
the
incalculabilities
the
intellectual
at
least
of
the
poetic
temperament
he
had
them
all
he
gave
himself
in
his
short
career
up
to
them
all
and
i
confess
that
partly
for
reasons
to
be
further
developed
i
am
unable
even
to
guess
what
they
might
eventually
have
made
of
him
which
is
of
course
what
brings
us
round
again
to
that
view
of
him
as
the
young
poet
with
absolutely
nothing
but
his
generic
spontaneity
to
trouble
about
the
young
poet
profiting
for
happiness
by
a
general
condition
unprecedented
for
young
poets
that
i
began
by
indulging
in
he
went
from
rugby
to
cambridge
where
after
a
while
he
carried
off
a
fellowship
at
king
and
where
during
a
short
visit
there
in
may
week
or
otherwise
early
in
june
i
first
and
as
i
was
to
find
very
unforgettingly
met
him
he
reappears
to
me
as
with
his
felicities
all
most
promptly
divinable
in
that
splendid
setting
of
the
river
at
the
backs
as
to
which
indeed
i
remember
vaguely
wondering
what
it
was
left
to
such
a
place
to
do
with
the
added
the
verily
wasted
grace
of
such
a
person
or
how
even
such
a
person
could
hold
his
own
as
who
should
say
at
such
a
pitch
of
simple
scenic
perfection
any
difficulty
dropped
however
to
the
reconciling
vision
for
that
the
young
man
was
publicly
and
responsibly
a
poet
seemed
the
fact
a
little
involved
to
the
promotion
of
a
certain
surprise
on
one
own
part
at
his
having
to
be
anything
it
was
to
come
over
me
still
more
afterwards
that
nothing
of
that
or
of
any
other
sort
need
really
have
rested
on
him
with
a
weight
of
obligation
and
in
fact
i
can
not
but
think
that
life
might
have
been
seen
and
felt
to
suggest
to
him
in
an
exposed
unanimous
conspiracy
that
his
status
should
be
left
to
the
general
sense
of
others
ever
so
many
others
who
would
sufficiently
take
care
of
it
and
that
such
a
fine
rare
case
was
accordingly
as
arguable
as
it
possibly
be
with
the
pure
undischarged
poetry
of
him
and
the
latent
presumption
of
his
dying
for
his
country
the
only
things
to
gainsay
it
the
question
was
to
a
certain
extent
crude
why
need
he
be
a
poet
why
need
he
so
specialise
but
if
this
was
so
it
was
only
it
was
already
symptomatic
of
the
interesting
final
truth
that
he
was
to
testify
to
his
function
in
the
unparalleled
way
he
was
going
to
have
the
life
the
unanimous
conspiracy
so
far
achieved
was
going
to
have
it
under
no
more
formal
guarantee
than
that
of
his
appetite
and
genius
for
it
and
this
was
to
help
us
all
to
the
complete
appreciation
of
him
no
single
scrap
of
the
english
fortune
at
its
easiest
and
truest
which
means
of
course
with
every
vulgarity
dropped
out
but
was
to
brush
him
as
by
the
readiest
instinctive
wing
never
a
point
or
achieving
a
miracle
to
do
so
only
trusting
his
exquisite
imagination
and
temper
to
respond
to
the
succession
of
his
opportunities
it
is
in
the
light
of
what
this
succession
could
in
the
most
natural
and
most
familiar
way
in
the
world
amount
to
for
him
that
we
find
this
idea
of
a
beautiful
crowning
modernness
above
all
to
meet
his
case
the
promptitude
the
perception
the
understanding
the
quality
of
humour
and
sociability
the
happy
lapses
in
the
logic
of
inward
reactions
save
for
their
all
infallibly
being
poetic
of
which
he
availed
himself
consented
to
be
as
illustrational
as
any
fondest
friend
could
wish
whether
the
subject
of
the
exhibition
was
aware
of
the
degree
or
not
and
made
his
vivacity
of
vision
his
exercise
of
fancy
and
irony
of
observation
at
its
freest
inevitable
while
at
the
same
time
setting
in
motion
no
machinery
of
experience
in
which
his
curiosity
or
in
other
words
the
quickness
of
his
familiarity
did
move
faster
than
anything
else
ii
i
owe
to
his
intimate
and
devoted
friend
mr
edward
marsh
the
communication
of
many
of
his
letters
these
already
gathered
into
an
admirable
brief
memoir
which
is
yet
to
appear
and
which
will
give
ample
help
in
the
illustrative
way
to
the
pages
to
which
the
present
remarks
form
a
preface
and
which
are
collected
from
the
columns
of
the
london
evening
journal
in
which
they
originally
saw
the
light
the
literary
baggage
of
his
short
course
consists
thus
of
his
two
slender
volumes
of
verse
and
of
these
two
scarcely
stouter
sheafs
of
correspondence
footnote
there
remain
also
to
be
published
a
book
on
john
webster
and
a
prose
play
in
one
though
i
should
add
that
the
hitherto
unpublished
letters
enjoy
the
advantage
of
a
commemorative
and
interpretative
commentary
at
the
editor
hands
which
will
have
rendered
the
highest
service
to
each
matter
that
even
these
four
scant
volumes
tell
the
whole
story
or
fix
the
whole
image
of
the
fine
young
spirit
they
are
concerned
with
we
certainly
hold
back
from
allowing
his
case
being
in
an
extraordinary
degree
that
of
a
creature
on
whom
the
gods
had
smiled
their
brightest
and
half
of
whose
manifestation
therefore
was
by
the
simple
act
of
presence
and
of
direct
communication
he
did
in
fact
specialise
to
repeat
my
term
only
since
as
one
reads
him
whether
in
verse
or
in
prose
that
distinguished
readability
seems
all
the
specialisation
one
need
invoke
so
when
the
question
was
of
the
gift
that
made
of
his
face
to
face
address
a
circumstance
so
complete
in
itself
as
apparently
to
cover
all
the
ground
leaving
no
margin
either
an
activity
to
the
last
degree
justified
appeared
the
only
name
for
one
impression
the
moral
of
all
which
is
doubtless
that
these
brief
if
at
the
same
time
very
numerous
moments
of
his
quick
career
formed
altogether
as
happy
a
time
in
as
happy
a
place
to
be
born
to
as
the
student
of
the
human
drama
has
ever
caught
sight
of
granting
always
that
is
that
some
actor
of
the
scene
has
been
thoroughly
up
to
his
part
such
was
the
sort
of
recognition
assuredly
under
which
rupert
played
that
of
his
lending
himself
to
every
current
and
contact
the
newer
the
later
fruit
of
time
the
better
only
this
not
because
any
particular
one
was
an
agitating
revelation
but
because
with
due
sensibility
with
a
restless
inward
ferment
at
the
centre
of
them
all
what
could
he
possibly
so
much
feel
like
as
the
heir
of
all
the
ages
i
remember
his
originally
giving
me
though
with
no
shade
of
imputable
intention
the
sense
of
his
just
that
with
the
highest
amiability
the
note
in
him
that
as
i
have
hinted
one
kept
coming
back
to
so
that
during
a
long
wait
for
another
glimpse
of
him
i
thought
of
the
practice
and
function
so
displayed
as
wholly
engaging
took
for
granted
his
keeping
them
up
with
equal
facility
and
pleasure
nothing
could
have
been
more
delightful
accordingly
later
on
in
renewal
of
the
personal
acquaintance
than
to
gather
that
this
was
exactly
what
had
been
taking
place
and
with
an
inveteracy
as
to
which
his
letters
are
a
full
documentation
whatever
his
own
terms
for
the
process
might
be
had
he
been
brought
to
book
and
though
the
variety
of
his
terms
for
anything
and
everything
was
the
very
play
and
even
the
measure
of
his
talent
the
most
charmed
and
conclusive
description
of
him
was
that
no
young
man
had
ever
so
naturally
taken
on
under
the
pressure
of
life
the
poetic
nature
and
shaken
it
so
free
of
every
encumbrance
by
simply
wearing
it
as
he
wore
his
complexion
or
his
outline
that
then
was
the
way
the
imagination
followed
him
with
its
luxury
of
confidence
he
was
doing
everything
that
could
be
done
in
the
time
since
this
was
the
modernest
note
but
performing
each
and
every
finest
shade
of
these
blest
acts
with
a
poetic
punctuality
that
was
only
matched
by
a
corresponding
social
sincerity
i
recall
perfectly
my
being
sure
of
it
all
the
while
even
if
with
little
current
confirmation
beyond
that
supplied
by
his
first
volume
of
verse
and
the
effect
of
the
whole
record
is
now
to
show
that
such
a
conclusion
was
quite
extravagantly
right
he
constantly
doing
all
the
things
and
this
with
a
reckless
freedom
as
it
might
be
called
that
really
dissociated
the
responsibility
of
the
precious
character
from
anything
like
conscious
domestic
coddlement
to
a
point
at
which
no
troubled
young
singer
none
that
is
equally
troubled
had
perhaps
ever
felt
he
could
afford
to
dissociate
it
rupert
resources
for
affording
in
the
whole
connection
were
his
humour
his
irony
his
need
under
every
quiver
of
inspiration
toward
whatever
end
to
be
amused
and
amusing
and
to
find
above
all
that
this
could
never
so
much
occur
as
by
the
application
of
his
talent
of
which
he
was
perfectly
conscious
to
his
own
case
he
carried
his
case
with
him
for
purposes
of
derision
as
much
as
for
any
others
wherever
he
went
and
how
he
went
everywhere
thus
blissfully
burdened
is
what
meets
us
at
every
turn
on
his
printed
page
my
only
doubt
about
him
springs
in
fact
from
the
question
of
whether
he
knew
that
the
earthly
felicity
enjoyed
by
him
his
possession
of
the
exquisite
temperament
linked
so
easily
to
the
irrepressible
experience
was
a
thing
to
make
of
the
young
briton
of
the
then
hour
so
nearly
the
spoiled
child
of
history
that
one
wanted
something
in
the
way
of
an
extra
guarantee
to
feel
soundly
sure
of
him
i
come
back
once
more
to
his
having
apparently
never
dreamt
of
any
stretch
of
the
point
of
liberal
allowance
of
adventure
on
behalf
of
development
never
dreamt
of
any
stretch
but
that
of
the
imagination
itself
indeed
quite
a
different
matter
and
even
if
it
too
were
at
moments
to
recoil
it
was
so
true
that
the
general
measure
of
his
world
as
to
what
it
might
be
prompt
and
pleasant
and
in
the
day
work
or
the
day
play
to
go
in
for
was
exactly
the
range
that
tinged
all
his
education
as
liberal
the
education
the
free
design
of
which
he
had
left
so
short
a
way
behind
him
when
he
died
just
there
was
the
luck
attendant
of
the
coincidence
of
his
course
with
the
moment
at
which
the
proceeding
hither
and
yon
to
the
tune
of
almost
any
happy
thought
and
in
the
interest
of
almost
any
branch
of
culture
or
invocation
of
response
that
might
be
more
easily
improvised
than
not
could
positively
strike
the
observer
as
excessive
as
in
fact
absurd
for
the
formation
of
taste
or
the
enrichment
of
genius
unless
the
principle
of
these
values
had
in
a
particular
connection
been
subjected
in
advance
to
some
challenge
or
some
test
why
should
it
take
such
a
flood
of
suggestion
such
a
luxury
of
acquaintance
and
contact
only
to
make
superficial
specimens
why
should
the
art
of
living
inward
a
little
more
and
thereby
of
digging
a
little
deeper
or
pressing
a
little
further
rather
modestly
replace
the
enviable
always
the
enviable
young
briton
enormous
range
of
alternatives
in
the
way
of
movement
the
way
of
vision
and
of
the
enormous
habit
of
holidays
if
one
could
have
made
out
once
for
all
that
holidays
were
proportionately
and
infallibly
inspiring
one
would
have
ceased
thoughtfully
to
worry
but
the
question
was
as
it
stood
an
old
story
even
though
it
might
freshly
radiate
on
occasion
under
the
recognition
that
the
patch
of
soil
flowered
when
it
did
flower
with
a
fragrance
all
its
own
this
concomitant
however
always
dangled
that
if
it
were
put
to
us
do
you
really
mean
you
would
rather
they
should
not
perpetually
have
been
again
for
a
at
berlin
or
an
awfully
good
time
at
munich
or
a
rush
round
sicily
or
a
dash
through
the
states
to
japan
with
whatever
like
rattling
renewals
you
would
after
all
shrink
from
the
responsibility
of
such
a
restriction
before
being
clear
as
to
what
you
would
suggest
in
its
place
rupert
went
on
from
king
to
lulworth
for
instance
which
the
association
of
the
two
places
the
two
so
extraordinarily
finished
scenes
causes
to
figure
as
a
sort
of
preliminary
flourish
and
everything
that
came
his
way
after
that
affects
me
as
the
blest
indulgence
in
flourish
upon
flourish
this
was
not
in
the
least
the
air
or
the
desire
or
the
pretension
of
it
but
the
unfailing
felicity
just
kept
catching
him
up
just
left
him
never
wanting
nor
waiting
for
some
pretext
to
roam
or
indeed
only
the
more
responsively
to
stay
doing
either
whichever
it
might
be
as
a
form
of
highly
intellectualised
fun
he
did
overflow
with
shillings
yet
so
far
as
roving
was
concerned
the
practice
was
always
easy
and
perhaps
the
adorably
whimsical
lyric
contained
in
his
second
volume
of
verse
on
the
pull
of
grantchester
at
his
heartstrings
as
the
old
vicarage
of
that
sweet
adjunct
to
cambridge
could
present
itself
to
him
in
a
berlin
cafe
may
best
exemplify
the
sort
of
thing
that
was
represented
in
one
way
and
another
by
his
taking
his
most
ultimately
english
ease
whatever
berlin
or
munich
to
speak
of
them
only
could
do
or
fail
to
do
for
him
how
can
one
not
rejoice
without
reserve
in
the
way
he
felt
what
he
did
feel
as
poetic
reaction
of
the
liveliest
and
finest
with
the
added
interest
of
its
often
turning
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
the
fullest
sincerity
and
to
a
perversity
of
the
most
evolved
since
i
can
not
dispense
with
that
sign
of
truth
never
was
a
young
singer
either
less
obviously
sentimental
or
less
addicted
to
the
mere
twang
of
the
guitar
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
always
his
personal
experience
or
his
curious
his
not
a
little
defiantly
excogitated
inner
vision
that
he
sought
to
catch
some
of
the
odd
fashion
of
his
play
with
which
latter
seems
on
occasion
to
preponderate
over
the
truly
pleasing
appeal
to
beauty
or
cultivated
habit
of
grace
odd
enough
no
doubt
that
rupert
should
appear
to
have
had
in
horror
the
cultivation
of
grace
for
its
own
sake
as
we
say
and
yet
should
really
not
have
disfigured
his
poetic
countenance
by
a
single
touch
quotable
as
showing
this
the
medal
of
the
mere
pleasant
had
always
a
reverse
for
him
and
it
was
generally
in
that
substitute
he
was
most
interested
we
catch
in
him
reaction
upon
reaction
the
succession
of
these
conducing
to
his
entirely
unashamed
poetic
complexity
and
of
course
one
observation
always
to
be
made
about
him
one
reminder
always
to
be
gratefully
welcomed
is
that
we
are
dealing
after
all
with
one
of
the
quantities
of
art
and
character
taken
together
that
ever
arrived
at
an
irresistible
appeal
his
irony
his
liberty
his
pleasantry
his
paradox
and
what
i
have
called
his
perversity
are
all
nothing
if
not
young
and
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
for
him
that
i
find
in
the
imagination
of
their
turning
in
time
dreadful
time
to
something
more
balanced
and
harmonised
a
difficulty
insuperable
the
the
poetic
of
his
so
free
figuration
in
verse
only
in
verse
oddly
enough
of
the
unpleasant
to
behold
to
touch
or
even
to
smell
was
certainly
i
think
nothing
if
not
but
there
were
so
many
things
in
his
consciousness
which
was
never
in
the
least
unpeopled
that
it
would
have
been
a
rare
chance
had
his
projection
of
the
self
that
we
are
so
apt
to
make
an
object
of
invidious
allusion
stayed
out
what
it
all
really
most
comes
to
you
feel
again
is
that
none
of
his
impulses
prospered
in
solitude
or
for
that
matter
were
so
much
as
permitted
to
mumble
their
least
scrap
there
he
was
predestined
and
condemned
to
sociability
which
no
league
of
neglect
could
have
deprived
him
of
even
had
it
speculatively
tried
whereby
what
was
it
but
his
own
image
that
he
most
saw
reflected
in
other
faces
it
would
still
have
been
there
it
could
possibly
have
succeeded
in
not
being
even
had
he
closed
his
eyes
to
it
with
elaborate
tightness
the
only
neglect
must
have
been
on
his
own
side
where
indeed
it
did
take
form
in
that
of
as
signal
an
opportunity
to
become
spoiled
probably
as
ever
fell
in
a
brilliant
young
man
way
so
that
to
help
out
my
comprehension
of
the
unsightly
and
unsavoury
sufficiently
wondered
at
with
which
his
muse
repeatedly
embraced
the
occasion
to
associate
herself
i
take
the
thing
for
a
declaration
of
the
idea
that
he
might
himself
prevent
the
spoiling
so
far
as
possible
he
could
in
fact
prevent
nothing
the
wave
of
his
fortune
and
his
favour
continuing
so
to
carry
him
which
is
doubtless
one
of
the
reasons
why
through
our
general
sense
that
nothing
could
possibly
not
be
of
the
last
degree
of
rightness
in
him
what
would
have
been
wrong
in
others
literally
in
any
creature
but
him
like
for
example
a
channel
passage
of
his
first
volume
simply
puts
on
while
this
particular
muse
stands
anxiously
by
a
kind
of
dignity
of
experiment
quite
consistent
with
our
congratulating
her
at
the
same
time
as
soon
as
it
is
over
what
was
a
channel
passage
thus
but
a
flourish
marked
with
the
sign
of
all
his
flourishes
that
of
being
a
success
and
having
fruition
though
it
performed
the
extraordinary
feat
of
directing
the
contents
of
the
poet
stomach
straight
at
the
object
of
his
displeasure
we
feel
that
by
some
excellent
grace
the
object
is
not
at
all
reached
too
many
things
and
most
of
all
too
innocently
enormous
a
cynicism
standing
in
the
way
and
themselves
receiving
the
tribute
having
in
a
word
impatient
young
cynicism
as
they
are
experience
as
well
as
various
things
iii
no
detail
of
mr
marsh
admirable
memoir
may
i
allow
myself
to
anticipate
i
can
only
announce
it
as
a
picture
with
all
the
elements
in
iridescent
fusion
of
the
felicity
that
fairly
dogged
rupert
steps
as
we
may
say
and
that
never
allowed
him
to
fall
below
its
measure
we
shall
read
into
it
even
more
relations
than
nominally
appear
and
every
one
of
them
again
a
flourish
every
one
of
them
a
connection
with
his
time
a
sampling
of
it
at
its
most
multitudinous
and
most
characteristic
every
one
of
them
too
a
record
of
the
state
of
some
other
charmed
not
less
than
charming
party
even
when
the
expression
of
the
interest
the
amusement
the
play
of
fancy
of
taste
of
whatever
sort
of
appreciation
or
reaction
for
his
own
spirit
is
the
ostensible
note
this
is
what
i
mean
in
especial
by
the
constancy
with
which
and
the
cost
at
which
perhaps
not
less
for
others
the
poetic
sensibility
was
maintained
and
guaranteed
it
was
as
genuine
as
if
he
had
been
a
bard
perched
on
an
eminence
with
a
harp
and
yet
it
was
arranged
for
as
we
may
say
by
the
close
consensus
of
those
who
had
absolutely
to
know
their
relation
with
him
but
as
a
delight
and
who
wanted
therefore
to
keep
him
to
the
last
point
true
to
himself
his
complete
curiosity
and
sociability
might
have
made
him
on
these
lines
factitious
if
it
had
not
happened
that
the
people
he
so
variously
knew
and
the
contacts
he
enjoyed
were
just
of
the
kind
to
promote
most
his
facility
and
vivacity
and
intelligence
of
life
they
were
all
young
together
allowing
for
three
or
four
notable
by
which
i
mean
far
from
the
least
responsive
exceptions
they
were
all
fresh
and
free
and
acute
and
aware
and
in
the
world
when
not
out
of
it
all
together
at
the
high
speculative
the
high
talkative
pitch
of
the
initiational
stage
of
these
latest
years
the
informed
and
animated
the
so
consciously
geniality
of
which
was
to
make
him
the
clearest
and
most
projected
poetic
case
with
the
question
of
difficulty
and
doubt
and
frustration
most
solved
the
question
of
the
immediate
and
its
implications
most
in
order
for
him
that
it
was
possible
to
conceive
he
had
found
at
once
to
his
purpose
a
wondrous
enough
old
england
an
england
breaking
out
into
numberless
assertions
of
a
new
awareness
into
liberties
of
high
and
clean
even
when
most
sceptical
and
discursive
young
intercourse
a
carnival
of
half
anxious
and
half
elated
criticism
all
framed
and
backgrounded
in
still
richer
accumulations
both
moral
and
material
or
as
who
should
say
pictorial
of
the
matter
of
course
and
the
taken
for
granted
nothing
could
have
been
in
greater
contrast
one
can
not
too
much
insist
to
the
situation
of
the
traditional
lonely
lyrist
who
yearns
for
connections
and
relations
yet
to
be
made
and
whose
difficulty
lyrical
emotional
personal
social
or
intellectual
has
thereby
so
little
in
common
with
any
embarrassment
of
choice
the
author
of
the
pages
before
us
was
perhaps
the
young
lyrist
in
all
the
annals
of
verse
who
having
the
largest
luxury
of
choice
yet
remained
least
demoralised
by
it
how
little
demoralised
he
was
to
round
off
his
short
history
by
showing
it
was
into
these
conditions
thickening
and
thickening
in
their
comparative
serenity
up
to
the
eleventh
hour
that
the
war
came
smashing
down
but
of
the
basis
the
great
garden
ground
all
green
and
russet
and
silver
all
a
tissue
of
distinguished
and
yet
so
easy
occasions
so
improvised
extensions
which
they
had
already
placed
at
his
service
and
that
of
his
extraordinarily
amiable
and
constantly
enlarged
set
for
the
exercise
of
dealing
with
the
rest
of
the
happy
earth
in
punctuating
interludes
it
is
the
office
of
our
few
but
precious
documents
to
enable
us
to
judge
the
interlude
that
here
concerns
us
most
is
that
of
the
year
spent
in
his
journey
round
a
considerable
part
of
the
world
in
testifying
with
a
charm
that
increases
as
he
goes
to
that
quest
of
unprejudiced
culture
the
true
poetic
the
vision
of
the
life
of
man
which
was
to
prove
the
liveliest
of
his
impulses
it
was
not
indeed
under
the
flag
of
that
research
that
he
offered
himself
for
the
army
almost
immediately
after
his
return
to
england
and
even
if
when
a
young
man
was
so
essentially
a
poet
we
need
see
no
act
in
him
as
a
prosaic
alternative
the
misfortune
of
this
set
of
letters
from
new
york
and
boston
from
canada
and
samoa
addressed
for
the
most
part
to
a
friendly
london
evening
journal
is
alas
in
the
fact
that
they
are
of
so
moderate
a
quantity
for
we
make
him
out
as
steadily
more
vivid
and
delightful
while
his
opportunity
grows
he
is
touching
at
first
inevitably
quite
juvenile
in
the
measure
of
his
good
faith
we
feel
him
not
a
little
lost
and
lonely
and
stranded
in
the
new
york
pandemonium
obliged
to
throw
himself
upon
and
the
overspread
blackness
pricked
out
in
a
flickering
fury
of
imaged
advertisement
for
want
of
some
more
interesting
view
of
character
and
manners
we
long
to
take
him
by
the
hand
and
show
him
finer
lights
eyes
of
but
meaner
range
after
all
being
adequate
to
the
gape
at
the
vertical
business
blocks
and
the
lurid
for
more
dollars
we
feel
in
a
manner
his
sensibility
wasted
and
would
fain
turn
it
on
to
the
capture
of
deeper
meanings
but
we
must
leave
him
to
himself
and
to
youth
facility
of
wonder
he
is
amused
beguiled
struck
on
the
whole
with
as
many
differences
as
we
could
expect
and
sufficiently
reminded
no
doubt
of
the
number
of
words
he
is
restricted
to
it
is
moreover
his
sign
as
it
is
that
of
the
poetic
turn
of
mind
in
general
that
we
seem
to
catch
him
alike
in
anticipations
or
divinations
and
in
lapses
and
freshnesses
of
experience
that
surprise
us
he
makes
various
reflections
some
of
them
all
perceptive
and
ingenious
as
about
the
faces
the
men
in
particular
seen
in
the
streets
the
public
conveyances
and
elsewhere
though
falling
a
little
short
in
his
friendly
wondering
way
of
that
bewildered
apprehension
of
monotony
of
type
of
modelling
lost
in
the
desert
which
we
might
have
expected
of
him
and
of
the
question
above
all
of
what
is
destined
to
become
of
that
more
and
more
vanishing
quantity
the
american
nose
other
than
judaic
what
we
note
in
particular
is
that
he
likes
to
all
appearance
many
more
things
than
he
does
and
how
superlatively
he
is
struck
with
the
promptitude
and
wholeness
of
the
american
welcome
and
of
all
its
friendly
service
what
it
is
but
too
easy
with
the
pleasure
of
having
known
him
to
read
into
all
this
is
the
operation
of
his
own
irresistible
quality
and
of
the
state
of
felicity
he
clearly
created
just
by
appearing
as
a
party
to
the
social
relation
he
moves
and
circulates
to
our
vision
as
so
naturally
so
beautifully
undesigning
a
weaver
of
that
spell
that
we
feel
comparatively
little
of
the
story
told
even
by
his
diverted
report
of
it
so
much
fuller
a
report
would
surely
proceed
could
we
appeal
to
their
memory
their
sense
of
poetry
from
those
into
whose
ken
he
floated
it
is
impossible
not
to
figure
him
to
the
last
felicity
as
he
comes
and
goes
presenting
himself
always
with
a
singular
effect
both
of
suddenness
and
of
the
readiest
rightness
we
should
always
have
liked
to
be
there
wherever
it
was
for
the
justification
of
our
own
fond
confidence
and
the
pleasure
of
seeing
it
unfailingly
spread
and
spread
the
ironies
and
paradoxes
of
his
verse
in
all
this
record
fall
away
from
him
he
takes
to
direct
observation
and
accepts
with
perfect
any
hazards
of
contact
some
of
the
shocks
of
encounter
proving
more
muffled
for
him
than
might
as
i
say
have
been
feared
witness
the
american
jew
with
whom
he
appears
to
have
spent
some
hours
in
canada
and
of
course
the
word
of
the
whole
thing
is
that
he
simply
reaped
at
every
turn
the
harmonising
benefit
that
his
presence
conferred
this
it
is
in
especial
that
makes
us
regret
so
much
the
scanting
as
we
feel
it
of
his
story
it
deprives
us
in
just
that
proportion
of
certain
of
the
notes
of
his
appearance
and
his
success
was
the
poetic
fact
involved
that
being
so
gratefully
apprehended
everywhere
his
own
response
was
inevitably
prescribed
and
pitched
as
the
perfect
friendly
and
genial
and
liberal
thing
moreover
the
value
of
his
having
so
let
himself
loose
in
the
immensity
tells
more
at
each
step
in
favour
of
his
style
the
pages
from
canada
where
as
an
impressionist
he
increasingly
finds
his
feet
and
even
finds
to
the
same
increase
a
certain
comfort
of
association
are
better
than
those
from
the
states
while
those
from
the
pacific
islands
rapidly
brighten
and
enlarge
their
inspiration
this
part
of
his
adventure
was
clearly
the
great
success
and
fell
in
with
his
fancy
amusing
and
quickening
and
rewarding
him
more
than
anything
in
the
whole
revelation
he
lightly
performs
the
miracle
to
my
own
sense
which
stevenson
which
even
pierre
loti
taking
however
long
a
rope
had
not
performed
he
charmingly
conjures
away
though
in
this
prose
more
than
in
the
verse
of
his
second
volume
the
marked
tendency
of
the
whole
exquisite
region
to
insist
on
the
secret
of
its
charm
when
incorrigibly
moved
to
do
so
only
at
the
expense
of
its
falling
a
little
flat
or
turning
a
little
stale
on
our
hands
i
have
for
myself
at
least
marked
the
tendency
and
somehow
felt
it
point
a
graceless
moral
the
moral
that
as
there
are
certain
faces
too
well
produced
by
nature
to
be
producible
again
by
the
painter
the
portraitist
so
there
are
certain
combinations
of
earthly
ease
of
the
natural
and
social
art
of
giving
pleasure
which
fail
of
character
or
accent
even
of
the
power
to
interest
under
the
strain
of
transposition
or
of
emphasis
rupert
with
an
instinct
of
his
own
transposes
and
insists
only
in
the
right
degree
or
what
it
doubtless
comes
to
is
that
we
simply
see
him
arrested
by
so
vivid
a
picture
of
the
youth
of
the
world
at
its
blandest
as
to
make
all
his
culture
seem
a
waste
and
all
his
questions
a
vanity
that
is
apparently
the
very
effect
of
the
pacific
life
as
those
who
dip
into
it
seek
or
feel
that
they
are
expected
to
seek
to
report
it
but
it
reports
itself
somehow
through
these
pages
smilingly
cools
itself
off
in
them
with
the
lightest
play
of
the
fan
ever
placed
at
its
service
never
clearly
had
he
been
on
such
good
terms
with
the
hour
never
found
the
life
of
the
senses
so
anticipate
the
life
of
the
imagination
or
the
life
of
the
imagination
so
content
itself
with
the
life
of
the
senses
it
is
all
an
abundance
of
amphibious
felicity
he
was
as
incessant
and
insatiable
a
swimmer
as
if
he
had
been
a
triton
framed
for
a
decoration
and
one
half
makes
out
that
some
instinct
some
vague
foreboding
of
what
awaited
him
on
his
own
side
the
globe
in
the
air
of
civilisation
prompted
him
to
drain
to
the
last
drop
the
whole
perfect
negation
of
the
acrid
he
might
have
been
waiting
for
the
tide
of
the
insipid
to
begin
to
flow
again
as
it
seems
ever
doomed
to
do
when
the
acrid
the
saving
acrid
has
already
ebbed
at
any
rate
his
holiday
had
by
the
end
of
the
springtime
of
done
for
him
all
it
could
without
a
grain
of
waste
his
assimilations
being
neither
loose
nor
literal
and
he
came
back
to
england
as
promiscuously
qualified
as
variously
quickened
as
his
best
friends
could
wish
for
fine
production
and
fine
illustration
in
some
order
still
awaiting
sharp
definition
never
certainly
had
the
free
poetic
sense
in
him
more
rejoiced
in
an
incorruptible
sincerity
iv
he
was
caught
up
of
course
after
the
shortest
interval
by
the
strong
rush
of
that
general
inspiration
in
which
at
first
all
differences
all
individual
relations
to
the
world
he
lived
in
seemed
almost
ruefully
or
bewilderedly
to
lose
themselves
the
pressing
thing
was
of
a
sudden
that
youth
was
youth
and
genius
community
and
sympathy
he
plunged
into
that
full
measure
of
these
things
which
simply
made
and
spread
itself
as
it
gathered
them
in
made
itself
of
responses
and
faiths
and
understandings
that
were
all
the
while
in
themselves
acts
of
curiosity
romantic
and
poetic
throbs
and
wonderments
with
reality
as
it
seemed
to
call
itself
breaking
in
after
a
fashion
that
left
the
whole
past
pale
and
that
yet
could
flush
at
every
turn
with
meanings
and
visions
borrowing
their
expression
from
whatever
had
among
those
squandered
preliminaries
those
too
merely
sportive
intellectual
and
critical
values
happened
to
make
most
for
the
higher
truth
of
the
successions
of
his
matter
of
history
at
this
time
mr
marsh
memoir
is
the
infinitely
touching
record
touching
after
the
fact
but
to
the
accompaniment
even
at
the
time
of
certain
now
almost
ineffable
reflections
this
especially
i
mean
if
one
happened
to
be
then
not
wholly
without
familiar
vision
of
him
what
could
strike
one
more
for
the
immense
occasion
than
the
measure
that
might
be
involved
in
it
of
desolating
and
waste
waste
of
quality
waste
for
that
matter
of
quantity
waste
of
all
the
rich
redundancies
all
the
light
and
all
the
golden
store
which
up
to
then
had
formed
the
very
price
and
grace
of
life
yet
out
of
the
depths
themselves
of
this
question
rose
the
other
the
tormenting
the
sickening
and
at
the
same
time
the
strangely
sustaining
of
why
since
the
offering
could
at
best
be
anything
but
great
it
would
be
great
just
in
proportion
to
its
purity
or
in
other
words
its
wholeness
everything
in
it
that
could
make
it
most
radiant
and
restless
exquisite
at
such
times
the
hushed
watch
of
the
mere
hovering
spectator
unrelieved
by
any
action
of
his
own
to
take
which
consists
at
once
of
so
much
wonder
for
why
the
finest
of
the
fine
should
to
the
sacrifice
of
the
faculty
we
most
know
them
by
have
to
become
mere
morsels
in
the
huge
promiscuity
and
of
the
thrill
of
seeing
that
they
add
more
than
ever
to
our
knowledge
and
our
passion
which
somehow
thus
becomes
at
the
same
time
an
unfathomable
abyss
rupert
who
had
joined
the
naval
brigade
took
part
in
the
rather
distractedly
improvised
as
it
at
least
at
the
moment
appeared
movement
for
the
relief
of
the
doomed
antwerp
but
was
later
on
after
the
return
of
the
force
so
engaged
for
a
few
days
in
london
whither
he
had
come
up
from
camp
in
dorsetshire
briefly
invalided
thanks
to
which
accident
i
had
on
a
couple
of
occasions
my
last
sight
of
him
it
was
all
auspiciously
extravagantly
congruous
nothing
certainly
could
have
been
called
more
modern
than
all
the
elements
and
suggestions
of
his
situation
for
the
hour
the
very
spot
in
london
that
could
best
serve
as
a
centre
for
vibrations
the
keenest
and
most
various
a
challenge
to
the
appreciation
of
life
to
that
of
the
whole
range
of
the
possible
english
future
at
its
most
uplifting
he
had
not
yet
so
much
struck
me
as
an
admirable
nature
and
such
as
any
cause
however
high
might
swallow
up
with
a
sense
of
being
the
sounder
and
sweeter
for
more
definitely
perhaps
the
young
poet
with
all
the
wind
alive
in
his
sails
was
as
evident
there
in
the
guise
of
the
young
soldier
and
the
thrice
welcome
young
friend
who
yet
i
all
recognisably
remember
insisted
on
himself
as
little
as
ever
in
either
character
and
seemed
even
more
disposed
than
usual
not
to
let
his
intelligibility
interfere
with
his
modesty
he
promptly
recovered
and
returned
to
camp
whence
it
was
testified
that
his
specific
practical
aptitude
under
the
lively
call
left
nothing
to
be
desired
a
fact
that
expressed
again
to
the
perception
of
his
circle
with
what
truth
the
spring
of
inspiration
worked
in
him
in
the
sense
i
mean
that
his
imagination
itself
shouldered
and
made
light
of
the
material
load
it
had
not
yet
at
the
same
time
been
more
associatedly
active
in
a
finer
sense
my
own
next
apprehension
of
it
at
least
was
in
reading
the
five
admirable
sonnets
that
had
been
published
in
new
numbers
after
the
departure
of
his
contingent
for
the
campaign
at
the
dardanelles
to
read
these
in
the
light
of
one
personal
knowledge
of
him
was
to
draw
from
them
inevitably
a
meaning
still
deeper
seated
than
their
noble
beauty
an
authority
of
the
purest
attended
with
which
his
name
inscribes
itself
in
its
own
character
on
the
great
english
scroll
the
impression
the
admiration
the
anxiety
settled
immediately
to
my
own
sense
at
least
as
upon
something
that
would
but
too
sharply
feed
them
falling
in
as
it
did
with
that
whole
particularly
animated
vision
of
him
of
which
i
have
spoken
he
had
never
seemed
more
animated
with
our
newest
and
least
deluded
least
conventionalised
life
and
perception
and
sensibility
and
that
formula
of
his
so
distinctively
fortunate
his
overflowing
share
in
our
most
developed
social
heritage
which
had
already
glimmered
began
with
this
occasion
to
hang
about
him
as
one
of
the
aspects
really
a
shining
one
of
his
fate
so
i
remember
irrepressibly
thinking
and
feeling
unspeakably
apprehending
in
a
word
and
so
the
whole
exquisite
exhalation
of
his
own
consciousness
in
the
splendid
sonnets
attach
whatever
essentially
or
exclusively
poetic
value
to
it
we
might
baffled
or
defied
us
as
with
a
sort
of
supreme
rightness
everything
about
him
of
keenest
and
brightest
yes
absolutely
of
brightest
suggestion
made
so
for
his
having
been
charged
with
every
privilege
every
humour
of
our
merciless
actuality
our
fatal
excess
of
opportunity
that
what
indeed
could
the
full
assurance
of
this
be
but
that
finding
in
him
the
most
charming
object
in
its
course
the
great
tide
was
to
lift
him
and
sweep
him
away
questions
and
reflections
after
the
fact
perhaps
yet
haunting
for
the
time
and
during
the
short
interval
that
was
still
to
elapse
when
with
the
sudden
news
that
he
met
his
doom
an
irrepressible
of
course
of
course
contributed
its
note
of
support
it
was
as
if
the
peculiar
richness
of
his
youth
had
itself
marked
its
limit
so
that
what
his
own
spirit
was
inevitably
to
feel
about
his
chance
inevitably
because
both
the
high
pitch
of
the
romantic
and
the
ironic
and
the
opposed
abyss
of
the
real
came
together
in
it
required
in
the
wondrous
way
the
consecration
of
the
event
the
event
came
indeed
not
in
the
manner
prefigured
by
him
in
the
repeatedly
perfect
line
that
of
the
received
the
fall
in
action
discounted
as
such
which
might
have
seemed
very
much
because
even
the
harsh
logic
and
pressure
of
history
were
tender
of
him
at
the
last
and
declined
to
go
through
more
than
the
form
of
their
function
discharging
it
with
the
least
violence
and
surrounding
it
as
with
a
legendary
light
he
was
taken
ill
as
an
effect
of
on
his
way
from
alexandria
to
gallipoli
and
getting
ominously
and
rapidly
worse
was
removed
from
his
transport
to
a
french
hospital
ship
where
irreproachably
cared
for
he
died
in
a
few
hours
and
without
coming
to
consciousness
i
deny
myself
any
further
anticipation
of
the
story
to
which
further
noble
associations
attach
and
the
merest
outline
of
which
indeed
tells
it
and
rounds
it
off
absolutely
as
the
right
harmony
would
have
it
it
is
perhaps
even
a
touch
beyond
any
harmony
that
under
omission
of
no
martial
honour
he
was
to
be
carried
by
comrades
and
devoted
waiting
sharers
whose
evidence
survives
them
to
the
steep
summit
of
a
greek
island
of
infinite
grace
and
there
placed
in
such
earth
and
amid
such
beauty
of
light
and
shade
and
embracing
prospect
as
that
the
fondest
reading
of
his
young
lifetime
could
have
suggested
nothing
better
it
struck
us
at
home
i
mean
as
symbolising
with
the
last
refinement
his
whole
instinct
of
selection
and
response
his
relation
to
the
overcharged
appeal
of
his
scene
and
hour
how
could
he
have
shown
more
the
young
english
poetic
possibility
and
faculty
in
which
we
were
to
seek
the
freshest
reflection
of
the
intelligence
and
the
soul
of
the
new
generation
the
generosity
i
may
fairly
say
the
joy
of
his
contribution
to
the
general
perfect
way
makes
a
monument
of
his
high
rest
there
at
the
heart
of
all
that
was
once
noblest
in
history

sedulously
he
may
have
avoided
a
preparatory
reading
of
those

which
our
hurried
and
observant

for

time

not
approach
sandy
hook
bar
with
so
completely
blank
a
mind
as
he
would
wish
so
at
least
i
found
it
is
not
so
much
that
the
recent
american
invasion
of
london
has
bitten
into
one
brain
a
very
definite
taste
of
a
jerking
vital
civilisation
but
the
various
and
vivid
comments
of
friends
to
whom
the
news
of
a
traveller
departure
is
broken
excite
and
predispose
the
imagination
that
so
many
people
who
have
been
there
should
have
such
different
and
decided
opinions
about
it
it
must
be
at
least
remarkable
i
felt
the
thrill
of
an
explorer
before
i
started
a
country
without
conversation
said
a
philosopher
the
big
land
has
a
big
heart
wrote
a
kindly
scholar
and
by
the
same
post
from
another
critic
that
land
of
crushing
hospitality
hell
but
it
fine
an
artist
told
me
el
cuspidorado
remarked
an
oxford
man
brilliantly
but
one
wiser
than
all
the
rest
wrote
think
gently
of
the
americans
they
are
so
very
young
and
so
very
anxious
to
appear
and
so
very
lovable
this
was
more
generous
than
the
unvarying
comment
of
ordinary
english
friends
when
they
heard
of
my
purpose
my
god
and
it
was
more
precise
than
those
nineteen
several
americans
to
each
of
whom
i
said
i
am
going
to
visit
america
and
each
of
whom
replied
after
long
reflection
wal
it
a
great
country
travelling
by
the
ordinary
routes
you
meet
the
american
people
a
week
before
you
meet
america
and
my
excitement
to
discover
what
precisely
this
nation
was
was
inflamed
rather
than
damped
by
the
attitude
of
a
charming
american
youth
who
crossed
by
the
same
boat
that
simplicity
that
is
not
far
down
in
any
american
was
very
beautifully
on
the
delightful
surface
with
him
the
second
day
out
he
sidled
shyly
up
to
me
of
what
nationality
you
he
asked
his
face
showed
bewilderment
when
he
heard
i
thought
all
englishmen
had
moustaches
he
said
i
told
him
of
the
infinite
variety
within
the
homogeneity
of
our
race
he
did
not
listen
but
settled
down
near
me
with
the
eager
kindliness
of
a
child
you
know
he
said
you
never
understand
america
no
sir
no
englishman
can
understand
america
i
been
in
london
in
your
houses
of
parliament
there
is
one
door
for
peers
to
go
in
at
and
one
for
ordinary
people
did
i
laugh
some
when
i
saw
that
you
bet
your
america
not
like
that
in
america
one
man
just
as
good
as
another
you
never
understand
america
i
was
all
humility
his
theme
and
his
friendliness
fired
him
he
rose
with
a
splendour
which
i
had
to
confess
to
myself
england
could
never
have
given
to
him
would
you
like
to
hear
me
to
you
the
declaration
of
independence
he
asked
and
he
did
so
it
was
with
a
fairly
blank
mind
and
yet
a
hope
of
understanding
or
at
least
of
seeing
something
very
remarkably
fresh
that
i
woke
to
hear
we
were
in
harbour
and
tumbled
out
on
deck
at
six
of
a
fine
summer
morning
to
view
a
new
world
new
york
harbour
is
loveliest
at
night
perhaps
on
the
staten
island
ferry
boat
you
slip
out
from
the
darkness
right
under
the
immense
as
they
recede
they
form
into
a
mass
together
heaping
up
one
behind
another
and
majestic
sentinel
over
the
black
waters
their
boldness
is
the
greater
because
to
either
side
sweep
in
the
east
river
and
the
hudson
river
leaving
this
piled
promontory
between
to
the
right
hangs
the
great
stretch
of
the
brooklyn
suspension
bridge
its
slight
curve
very
purely
outlined
with
light
over
it
luminous
trams
like
shuttles
of
fire
are
thrown
across
and
across
continually
weaving
the
stuff
of
human
existence
from
further
off
all
these
lights
dwindle
to
a
radiant
semicircle
that
gazes
out
over
the
expanse
with
a
quiet
mysterious
expectancy
far
away
seaward
you
may
see
the
low
golden
glare
of
coney
island
but
there
was
beauty
in
the
view
that
morning
also
half
an
hour
after
sunrise
new
york
always
the
cleanest
and
least
smoky
of
cities
lay
asleep
in
a
queer
pearly
hourless
light
a
thin
mist
softened
the
further
outlines
the
water
was
opalescent
under
a
silver
sky
cool
and
dim
very
slightly
ruffled
by
the
sweet
wind
that
followed
us
in
from
the
sea
a
few
streamers
of
smoke
flew
above
the
city
oblique
and
parallel
pennants
of
our
civilisation
the
space
of
water
is
great
and
so
the
vast
buildings
do
not
tower
above
one
as
they
do
from
the
street
scale
is
lost
and
they
might
be
any
size
the
impression
is
rather
of
long
low
buildings
stretching
down
to
the
water
edge
on
every
side
and
innumerable
low
black
wharves
and
jetties
and
piers
and
at
one
point
the
lower
end
of
the
island
on
which
the
city
proper
stands
rose
that
higher
clump
of
the
great
buildings
the
singer
the
woolworth
and
the
rest
their
strength
almost
severity
of
line
and
the
lightness
of
their
colour
gave
a
kind
of
classical
feeling
classical
and
yet
not
of
europe
it
had
the
air
this
block
of
masonry
of
edifices
built
to
satisfy
some
faith
for
more
than
immediate
ends
only
the
faith
was
unfamiliar
but
if
these
buildings
embodied
its
nature
it
is
cold
and
hard
and
light
like
the
steel
that
is
their
heart
the
first
sight
of
these
strange
fanes
has
queer
resemblances
to
the
first
sight
of
that
lonely
and
secret
group
by
pisa
walls
it
came
upon
me
at
that
moment
that
they
could
not
have
been
dreamed
and
made
without
some
nobility
perhaps
the
hour
lent
them
sanctity
for
i
have
often
noticed
since
that
in
the
early
morning
and
again
for
a
little
about
sunset
the
are
no
longer
merely
the
means
and
local
convenience
for
men
to
pursue
their
purposes
but
acquire
that
characteristic
of
the
great
buildings
of
the
world
an
existence
and
meaning
of
their
own
our
boat
moved
up
the
harbour
and
along
the
hudson
river
with
a
superb
and
courteous
stateliness
round
her
snorted
and
scuttled
and
puffed
the
multitudinous
strange
denizens
of
the
harbour
tugs
steamers
long
rafts
carrying
great
lines
of
trucks
from
railway
to
railway
dredgers
even
a
or
two
for
the
day
work
was
beginning
among
them
with
that
majesty
that
only
a
liner
entering
a
harbour
has
she
went
progressed
had
her
moving
english
contains
no
word
for
such
a
motion
patuit
a
goddess
entering
fairyland
i
thought
for
the
huddled
beauty
of
these
buildings
and
the
still
silver
expanse
of
the
water
seemed
unreal
then
i
looked
down
at
the
water
immediately
beneath
me
and
knew
that
new
york
was
a
real
city
all
kinds
of
refuse
went
floating
by
bits
of
wood
straw
from
barges
bottles
boxes
paper
occasionally
a
dead
cat
or
dog
hideously
its
four
paws
stiff
and
indignant
towards
heaven
this
analysis
of
fairyland
turned
me
towards
the
statue
of
liberty
already
passed
and
growing
distant
it
is
one
of
those
things
you
have
long
wanted
to
see
and
have
expected
to
admire
which
seen
give
you
a
double
thrill
that
they
at
last
and
that
they
better
than
your
hopes
for
liberty
stands
nobly
americans
always
shy
about
their
country
have
learnt
from
the
ridicule
which
europeans
on
mixed
aesthetic
and
moral
grounds
pour
on
this
statue
to
dismiss
it
with
an
apologetic
laugh
yet
it
is
fine
until
you
get
near
enough
to
see
its
clumsiness
i
admired
the
great
gesture
of
it
a
hand
fell
on
my
shoulder
and
a
voice
said
look
hard
at
that
young
man
that
the
first
time
you
seen
liberty
and
it
will
be
the
last
till
you
turn
your
back
on
this
country
again
it
was
an
american
one
of
the
tall
thin
type
of
american
with
pale
blue
eyes
of
an
idealistic
disappointed
expression
and
an
indian
profile
the
other
half
of
america
personated
by
a
small
bumptious
eager
man
with
a
cigar
raking
at
an
irritating
angle
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
joined
in
with
wal
i
should
smile
i
guess
this
is
the
land
of
freedom
anyway
the
tall
man
swung
round
freedom
do
you
call
it
a
free
land
where
he
gave
instances
of
the
power
of
the
dollar
the
other
man
kept
up
the
argument
by
spitting
and
by
asseveration
as
the
busy
little
tugs
with
rugs
on
their
noses
butted
the
great
liner
into
her
narrow
dock
the
pessimist
launched
his
last
shafts
the
short
man
denied
nothing
he
drew
the
cigar
from
his
lips
shot
it
back
with
a
popping
noise
into
the
round
hole
cigars
had
worn
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
said
anyway
it
some
country
i
was
introduced
to
america
ii
new
york
in
five
things
america
excels
modern
england
fish
architecture
jokes
drinks
and
children
clothes
there
may
be
others
of
these
i
am
certain
the
jokes
and
drinks
which
curiously
resemble
each
other
are
the
best
there
is
a
cheerful
violence
about
them
they
take
their
respective
kingdoms
by
storm
all
the
lesser
things
one
has
heard
turn
out
to
be
delightfully
true
the
first
hour
in
america
proves
them
people
here
talk
with
an
american
accent
their
teeth
are
inlaid
with
gold
the
mouths
of
move
slowly
slowly
with
an
oblique
oval
motion
for
they
are
chewing
pavements
are
it
is
all
true
but
there
were
other
things
one
expected
though
in
no
precise
form
what
for
instance
would
it
be
like
the
feeling
of
whatever
democracy
america
has
secured
i
landed
rather
forlorn
that
first
morning
on
the
immense
covered
wharf
where
the
customs
mysteries
were
to
be
celebrated
the
place
was
dominated
by
a
large
dirty
vociferous
man
coatless
in
a
black
shirt
and
black
apron
his
mouth
and
jaw
were
huge
he
looked
like
a
caricaturist
roosevelt
company
was
written
on
his
forehead
labels
of
a
thousand
colours
printed
slips
pencils
and
pieces
of
string
hung
from
his
pockets
and
his
hands
were
held
behind
his
ears
and
in
his
mouth
i
laid
my
situation
and
my
incompetence
before
him
and
learnt
right
where
to
go
and
right
when
to
go
there
then
he
flung
a
vast
dingy
arm
round
my
shoulders
and
bellowed
we
have
your
baggage
right
along
to
your
hotel
in
two
hours
it
was
a
lie
but
kindly
that
grimy
and
generous
embrace
left
me
startled
but
an
initiate
into
democracy
the
other
evening
i
went
a
lonely
ramble
to
try
to
detect
the
essence
of
new
york
a
wary
eavesdropper
can
always
surprise
the
secret
of
a
city
through
chance
scraps
of
conversation
or
by
spying
from
a
window
or
by
coming
suddenly
round
corners
i
started
on
a
american
are
open
all
along
the
side
and
can
be
entered
at
any
point
in
it
the
side
is
divided
by
vertical
bars
it
looks
like
a
cage
with
the
horizontal
lines
taken
out
between
these
vertical
bars
you
squeeze
into
the
seat
if
the
seat
opposite
you
is
full
you
swing
yourself
along
the
bars
by
your
hands
till
you
find
room
the
americans
become
terrifyingly
expert
at
this
i
have
seen
them
fat
business
men
scampering
up
and
down
the
face
of
the
cars
by
means
of
their
hands
swinging
themselves
over
and
round
and
above
each
other
like
nothing
in
the
world
so
much
as
the
monkeys
at
the
zoo
it
is
a
people
informed
with
vital
energy
i
believe
that
this
exercise
and
the
habit
of
drinking
a
lot
of
water
between
meals
are
the
chief
causes
of
their
good
health
the
broadway
car
runs
mostly
along
the
backbone
of
the
queer
island
on
which
this
city
stands
so
the
innumerable
parallel
streets
that
cross
it
curve
down
and
away
and
at
this
time
street
after
street
to
the
west
reveals
and
seems
to
drop
into
a
mysterious
evening
sky
full
of
dull
reds
and
yellows
amber
and
pale
green
and
a
few
pink
flecks
and
in
the
midst
sometimes
the
flushed
face
of
the
sun
then
greyness
broken
by
these
patches
of
misty
colour
settles
into
the
lower
channels
of
the
new
york
streets
while
the
upper
heights
of
the
clear
of
the
roofs
are
still
lit
on
the
sunward
side
with
a
mellow
glow
curiously
serene
to
the
man
in
the
mirk
of
the
street
they
seem
to
exude
this
light
from
the
great
spaces
of
brick
at
this
time
the
cars
always
polyglot
are
filled
with
and
workers
and
no
english
at
all
is
heard
one
is
surrounded
with
yiddish
italian
and
greek
broken
by
polish
or
russian
or
german
some
american
anthropologists
claim
that
the
children
of
these
immigrants
show
marked
changes
in
the
shape
of
skull
and
face
towards
the
american
type
it
may
be
so
but
the
people
who
surround
one
are
mostly
they
represent
very
completely
that
of
continental
appearance
which
is
labelled
in
the
english
mind
like
a
foreigner
being
short
swarthy
gesticulatory
full
of
clatter
indeterminately
alien
only
in
their
dress
and
gait
have
they
or
at
least
the
men
among
them
become
at
all
american
the
american
by
race
walks
better
than
we
more
freely
with
a
taking
swing
and
almost
with
grace
how
much
of
this
is
due
to
living
in
a
democracy
and
how
much
to
wearing
no
braces
it
is
very
difficult
to
determine
but
certainly
it
is
the
land
of
belts
and
therefore
of
more
loosely
moving
bodies
this
and
the
padded
shoulders
of
the
coats
and
the
trousers
make
a
figure
more
presentable
at
a
distance
than
most
urban
civilisations
turn
out
also
americans
take
their
coats
off
which
is
sensible
and
they
can
do
it
the
more
beautifully
because
they
are
belted
and
not
braced
they
take
their
coats
off
anywhere
and
and
somehow
it
strikes
the
visitor
as
the
most
symbolic
thing
about
them
they
have
not
yet
thought
of
discarding
collars
but
they
are
unashamedly
any
sculptor
seeking
to
figure
this
republic
in
stone
must
carve
in
future
a
young
man
in
pleasant
and
rather
vulgar
straw
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
his
trousers
full
and
sloppy
his
coat
over
his
arm
the
motto
written
beneath
will
be
of
course
is
some
country
the
philosophic
gazer
on
such
a
monument
might
get
some
way
towards
understanding
the
making
of
the
panama
canal
that
exploit
that
no
european
nation
could
have
carried
out
what
facial
type
the
sculptor
would
give
the
youth
is
harder
to
determine
and
very
hard
to
describe
the
american
race
seems
to
have
developed
two
classes
and
only
two
the
and
the
their
faces
are
very
distinct
the
head
is
long
often
fine
about
the
forehead
and
eyes
and
very
cleanly
outlined
the
eyes
have
an
odd
tired
pathos
in
them
mixed
with
the
friendliness
that
is
so
admirable
as
if
of
a
perpetual
never
quite
successful
effort
to
understand
something
it
is
like
the
face
of
an
only
child
who
has
been
brought
up
in
the
company
of
adults
i
am
convinced
it
is
partly
due
to
the
endeavour
to
set
their
standards
by
the
culture
and
traditions
of
older
nations
but
the
mouth
of
such
men
is
the
most
typical
feature
it
is
small
tight
and
closed
downwards
at
the
corners
the
lower
lip
very
slightly
protruding
it
has
little
expression
in
it
and
no
curves
there
the
puritan
comes
out
but
no
other
nation
has
a
mouth
like
this
it
is
shared
to
some
extent
by
the
lower
classes
but
their
mouths
tend
to
be
wider
and
more
expressive
their
foreheads
are
meaner
and
their
eyes
hard
but
the
whole
face
rather
more
adaptive
and
in
touch
with
life
these
anyhow
are
the
types
that
strike
one
in
the
eastern
cities
and
there
are
intermediate
varieties
as
of
the
genial
with
the
narrow
forehead
and
the
wide
smooth
the
too
wide
and
too
smooth
lower
face
smoothness
is
the
one
unfailing
characteristic
why
do
american
faces
hardly
ever
wrinkle
is
it
the
absence
of
a
soul
it
must
be
for
it
is
less
true
of
the
bostonian
than
of
the
ordinary
business
american
in
whose
life
exhilaration
and
depression
take
the
place
of
joy
and
suffering
the
women
faces
are
more
indeterminate
not
very
feminine
many
of
them
wear
those
which
centre
glitteringly
about
the
bridge
of
the
nose
and
get
from
them
a
curious
air
of
intelligence
handsome
people
of
both
sexes
are
very
common
beautiful
and
pretty
ones
very
rare
i
slipped
from
my
car
up
about
fortieth
street
the
region
where
the
theatres
and
restaurants
are
the
forties
broadway
here
might
be
the
offspring
of
shaftesbury
avenue
and
leicester
square
with
somehow
some
of
fleet
street
also
in
its
ancestry
i
passed
two
men
on
the
sidewalk
their
hats
on
the
back
of
their
heads
arguing
fiercely
one
had
slightly
long
hair
the
other
looked
the
more
truculent
and
was
saying
to
him
intensely
see
here
we
contracted
with
you
to
supply
us
with
sonnets
at
five
dollars
per
sonnet
i
passed
up
a
one
of
those
deserted
ways
that
abound
just
off
the
big
streets
resorts
apparently
for
such
people
and
things
as
are
not
quite
strident
or
not
quite
energetic
enough
for
the
ordinary
glare
of
life
dim
places
fusty
with
hesternal
excitements
and
the
thrills
of
yesteryear
against
a
flight
of
desolate
steps
leant
a
notice
i
stopped
to
read
it
it
said
you
must
see
cockie
positively
the
only
bird
that
can
both
dance
and
sing
she
is
almost
superhuman
there
was
no
explanation
cockie
may
have
been
dead
for
years
i
went
musing
on
her
possible
fates
towards
the
pride
and
spaciousness
of
fifth
avenue
fifth
avenue
is
handsome
the
handsomest
street
imaginable
it
is
what
the
streets
of
german
cities
try
to
be
the
buildings
are
large
square
built
with
the
solidity
of
opulence
the
street
as
a
whole
has
a
character
and
an
air
of
achievement
whatever
else
may
be
doubted
or
denied
american
civilisation
has
produced
this
one
feels
rich
and
safe
as
one
walks
back
in
broadway
new
york
dropped
her
mask
and
began
to
betray
herself
once
again
a
little
crowd
expressionless
intent
and
volatile
before
a
small
shop
drew
me
in
the
was
a
young
man
a
little
conscious
and
a
little
bored
dressed
very
lightly
in
what
might
have
been
a
runner
costume
he
was
bowing
twisting
and
posturing
in
a
slow
rhythm
from
time
to
time
he
would
put
a
large
card
on
a
little
stand
in
the
corner
the
cards
bore
various
legends
he
would
display
a
card
that
said
this
underwear
does
not
impede
the
movement
of
the
body
in
any
direction
then
he
moved
his
body
in
every
direction
from
position
to
position
probable
or
improbable
and
was
not
impeded
with
a
terrible
dumb
patience
he
turned
the
next
card
it
gives
with
the
body
in
violent
exercising
the
young
man
leapt
suddenly
lunged
smote
imaginary
balls
belaboured
invisible
opponents
ran
with
immense
speed
but
no
progress
was
thrown
to
earth
by
the
prince
of
the
air
kicked
struggled
then
bounded
to
his
feet
again
but
all
this
without
a
word
it
enables
you
to
keep
cool
while
exercising
the
young
man
exercised
and
yet
was
cool
he
did
this
i
discovered
later
for
many
hours
a
day
not
daring
to
imagine
his
state
of
mind
i
hurried
off
through
union
square
one
of
the
many
daily
had
gone
the
traffic
was
drawn
to
one
side
and
several
came
with
clanging
of
bells
and
shouting
through
the
space
gleaming
with
brass
splendid
in
their
purpose
before
the
thrill
in
the
heart
had
time
to
die
or
the
traffic
to
close
up
swung
through
an
immense
open
driven
by
a
young
mechanic
it
was
luxuriously
appointed
and
had
the
air
of
a
private
car
being
returned
from
repairing
the
man
in
it
had
an
almost
swinburnian
mane
of
red
hair
blowing
back
in
the
wind
catching
the
last
lights
of
day
he
was
clad
as
such
people
often
are
in
this
country
these
hot
days
only
in
a
suit
of
yellow
overalls
so
that
his
arms
and
shoulders
and
neck
and
chest
were
bare
he
was
big
and
strong
and
he
drove
the
car
not
wildly
but
a
little
too
fast
leaning
back
rather
insolently
conscious
of
power
in
private
life
no
doubt
a
very
ordinary
youth
interested
only
in
baseball
scores
but
in
this
brief
passage
he
seemed
like
a
greek
god
in
a
fantastically
modern
yet
not
unworthy
way
emblemed
and
incarnate
or
like
the
spirit
of
of
speed
so
i
found
a
better
image
of
america
for
my
sculptor
than
the
young
man
iii
new
york
the
hotel
into
which
the
workings
of
blind
chance
have
thrown
me
is
given
over
to
commercial
travellers
its
life
is
theirs
and
the
few
english
tourists
creep
in
and
out
with
the
shy
bewildered
dignity
of
their
race
and
class
these
american
commercial
travellers
are
called
drummers
in
the
most
endless
and
pointless
and
extraordinary
of
wars
they
have
the
air
and
appearance
of
devotees
men
set
aside
roaming
preachers
of
a
whose
meaning
they
have
forgotten
they
seem
to
be
invariably
of
the
short
dark
type
the
larger
men
are
common
in
business
but
not
in
the
drummer
eyes
have
a
hard
rapt
expression
he
is
not
interested
in
the
romance
of
the
road
like
an
english
commercial
traveller
only
in
its
end
these
people
are
for
ever
sending
off
and
receiving
telegrams
messages
and
cablegrams
they
are
continually
telephoning
stenographers
are
in
waiting
to
record
their
inspirations
in
the
intervals
of
activity
they
relapse
into
a
curious
trance
husbanding
their
vitality
for
the
next
crisis
i
have
watched
them
with
terror
and
fascination
all
day
there
are
numbers
of
them
sitting
immote
and
vacant
in
rows
and
circles
on
the
hard
chairs
in
the
hall
they
are
never
smoking
never
reading
a
paper
never
even
chewing
the
expressions
of
their
faces
never
change
it
is
impossible
to
guess
what
or
if
anything
is
in
their
minds
hour
upon
hour
they
remain
occasionally
one
will
rise
in
obedience
to
some
call
or
revelation
incomprehensible
to
us
and
move
out
through
the
door
into
the
clang
and
confusion
of
broadway
it
all
confirms
the
impression
that
grows
on
the
visitor
to
america
that
business
has
developed
insensibly
into
a
religion
in
more
than
the
light
metaphorical
sense
of
the
words
it
has
its
ritual
and
theology
its
high
places
and
its
jargon
as
well
as
its
priests
and
martyrs
one
of
its
more
mystical
manifestations
is
in
advertisement
america
has
a
childlike
faith
in
advertising
they
advertise
here
everywhere
and
in
all
ways
they
shout
your
most
private
and
sacred
wants
at
you
nothing
is
untouched
every
day
i
pass
a
wall
some
five
hundred
square
feet
of
which
a
gentleman
has
taken
to
declare
that
he
is
to
break
the
undertakers
trust
half
the
advertisement
is
a
coloured
photograph
of
himself
the
rest
is
see
what
i
give
you
for
and
a
list
of
what
he
does
give
he
gives
everything
that
the
most
morbid
taphologist
could
suggest
beginning
with
splendidly
carved
oak
casket
with
black
ivory
handles
four
draped
flambeaux
and
going
on
to
funereal
ingenuities
that
would
have
overwhelmed
mausolus
and
make
death
impossible
for
a
refined
man
but
there
are
heights
as
well
as
depths
i
have
been
privileged
with
some
intimate
glances
into
the
greatest
of
those
peculiarly
american
institutions
the
big
departmental
stores
materially
it
is
an
immense
building
containing
all
things
that
any
person
could
conceivably
want
such
a
store
includes
even
art
with
the
same
bland
omnipotence
if
you
wander
into
the
vast
auditorium
it
is
equal
chances
whether
you
hear
a
work
of
beethoven
victor
herbert
schonberg
or
mr
hirsch
if
you
are
you
may
choose
between
a
large
coloured
photograph
of
the
eiffel
tower
a
carbon
print
of
botticelli
and
a
reproduction
of
an
by
herr
kandinsky
you
may
buy
an
elizabethan
a
bronze
the
latest
dress
designed
by
bakst
or
a
packet
of
pins
or
you
may
sit
and
muse
on
the
life
of
the
employee
of
this
place
who
gets
from
it
all
that
in
less
favoured
civilisations
family
guild
club
township
and
nationality
have
given
him
or
her
as
a
child
he
gets
education
then
gymnasia
military
training
orchestra
facilities
for
the
study
of
anything
under
the
sun
from
palaeography
to
cherokee
libraries
hospitals
medical
attendance
and
at
the
end
a
pension
and
i
suppose
a
store
cemetery
and
all
for
the
price
of
a
few
work
a
day
and
a
little
loyalty
to
the
can
human
hearts
desire
more
and
when
all
millionaires
are
as
sensible
will
they
in
industries
and
businesses
like
this
where
the
majority
of
the
employed
are
women
it
ought
to
be
a
pretty
stable
sort
of
millennium
men
perhaps
take
longer
to
learn
that
kind
of
in
one
corner
of
this
store
is
the
advertising
department
there
are
gathered
poets
artists
and
mere
intellectuals
all
engaged
in
explaining
to
the
upper
what
there
is
for
them
to
buy
and
why
they
should
buy
it
it
is
a
life
of
good
salary
steady
hours
sufficient
leisure
and
entire
dignity
there
is
no
vulgarity
in
this
advertising
but
the
most
perfect
taste
and
great
artistic
daring
and
novelty
the
most
productions
of
europe
are
scanned
for
ideas
and
suggestions
two
of
the
leading
young
painters
in
paris
whose
names
are
just
beginning
to
be
known
in
england
have
been
designing
posters
for
this
store
for
years
i
stood
and
watched
with
awe
a
young
american
genius
doing
entirely
illustrations
to
some
notes
on
summer
suitings
we
give
our
artists
a
free
hand
said
the
very
intelligent
lady
in
charge
of
that
section
except
of
course
for
nudes
or
improprieties
and
we
do
allow
any
figures
of
people
some
of
our
customers
object
very
strongly
cities
like
cats
will
reveal
themselves
at
night
there
comes
an
hour
of
evening
when
lower
broadway
the
business
end
of
the
town
is
deserted
and
if
having
felt
yourself
immersed
in
men
and
the
frenzy
of
cities
all
day
you
stand
out
in
the
street
in
this
sudden
hush
you
will
hear
like
a
strange
questioning
voice
from
another
world
the
melancholy
boom
of
a
foghorn
and
realise
that
not
half
a
mile
away
are
the
waters
of
the
sea
and
some
great
liner
making
its
slow
way
out
to
the
atlantic
after
that
the
lights
come
out
and
the
new
york
of
theatres
and
vaudevilles
and
restaurants
begins
to
roar
and
flare
the
merciless
lights
throw
a
mask
of
unradiant
glare
on
the
human
beings
in
the
streets
making
each
face
hard
set
wolfish
terribly
blue
the
chorus
of
voices
becomes
shriller
the
buildings
tower
away
into
obscurity
looking
strangely
theatrical
because
lit
from
below
and
beyond
them
soars
the
purple
roof
of
the
night
a
stranger
of
another
race
loitering
here
might
cast
his
eyes
up
in
a
vague
wonder
what
powers
kind
or
maleficent
controlled
or
observed
this
whirlpool
he
would
find
only
this
unresponsive
canopy
of
black
unpierced
even
if
the
seeker
stood
near
a
centre
of
lights
by
any
star
but
while
he
looks
away
up
in
the
sky
out
of
the
gulfs
of
night
spring
two
vast
fiery
erect
leaning
towards
each
other
and
hanging
on
to
the
bristles
of
them
a
little
devil
little
but
gigantic
who
kicks
and
wriggles
and
glares
after
a
few
moments
the
devil
baffled
by
the
firmness
of
the
bristles
stops
hangs
still
rolls
his
eyes
and
in
a
fury
of
disappointment
goes
out
leaving
only
the
night
blacker
and
a
little
bewildered
and
the
unconscious
throngs
of
human
beings
turning
with
terrified
relief
from
this
exhibition
of
diabolic
impotence
the
stranger
finds
a
divine
hand
writing
slowly
across
the
opposite
quarter
of
the
heavens
its
igneous
message
of
warning
to
the
nations
wear
underwear
for
youths
and
and
close
by
this
message
come
forth
a
youth
and
a
flaming
and
immortal
clad
in
celestial
underwear
box
a
short
round
vanish
reappear
for
another
round
and
again
disappear
night
after
night
they
wage
this
combat
what
gods
they
are
who
fight
endlessly
and
indecisively
over
new
york
is
not
for
our
knowledge
whether
it
be
thor
and
odin
or
zeus
and
cronos
or
michael
and
lucifer
or
ormuzd
and
ahriman
or
and
the
ways
of
our
lords
were
ever
riddling
and
obscure
to
the
right
a
celestial
bottle
stretching
from
the
horizon
to
the
zenith
appears
is
uncorked
and
scatters
the
worlds
with
the
foam
of
what
ambrosial
liquor
may
have
been
within
beyond
a
spanish
goddess
some
minor
deity
in
the
dionysian
theogony
dances
continually
rapt
and
mysterious
to
the
music
of
the
spheres
her
head
in
cassiopeia
and
her
twinkling
feet
among
the
pleiades
and
near
her
orion
archer
no
longer
releases
himself
from
his
strained
posture
to
drive
a
sidereal
out
of
sight
through
the
meadows
of
paradise
then
poses
addresses
and
drives
again
o
nineveh
are
these
thy
gods
thine
also
mighty
nineveh
why
this
theophany
or
how
the
gods
have
got
out
to
perform
their
various
on
the
moenia
is
not
asked
by
their
incurious
devotees
through
broadway
the
dingily
glittering
tide
spreads
itself
over
the
sands
of
theatres
and
are
aglare
cars
shriek
down
the
street
the
elevated
train
clangs
and
curves
perilously
overhead
newsboys
wail
the
baseball
news
wits
cry
their
obscure
challenges
to
one
another
should
worry
or
some
daisy
or
nurse
in
houses
off
the
streets
around
children
are
being
born
lovers
are
kissing
people
are
dying
above
in
the
midst
of
those
coruscating
divinities
sits
one
older
and
greater
than
any
most
colossal
of
all
it
flashes
momently
out
a
woman
head
all
flame
against
the
darkness
it
is
beautiful
passionless
in
its
simplicity
and
conventional
representation
queerly
like
an
archaic
greek
or
early
egyptian
figure
queen
of
the
night
behind
and
of
the
gods
around
and
of
the
city
below
here
if
at
all
you
think
may
one
find
the
answer
to
the
riddle
her
ostensible
message
burning
in
the
firmament
beside
her
is
that
we
should
buy
pepsin
but
there
is
more
not
to
be
given
in
words
ineffable
suddenly
when
she
has
surveyed
mankind
she
closes
her
left
eye
three
times
she
winks
and
then
vanishes
no
ordinary
winks
these
but
portentous
terrifyingly
steady
obliterating
a
great
tract
of
the
sky
hour
by
hour
she
does
this
night
by
night
year
by
year
that
enigmatic
obscuration
of
light
that
answer
that
is
no
answer
is
perhaps
the
first
thing
in
this
world
that
a
child
born
near
here
will
see
and
the
last
that
a
dying
man
will
have
to
take
for
a
message
to
the
curious
dead
she
is
immortal
men
have
worshipped
her
as
isis
and
as
ashtaroth
as
venus
as
cybele
mother
of
the
gods
and
as
mary
there
is
a
statue
of
her
by
the
steps
of
the
british
museum
here
above
the
fantastic
civilisation
she
observes
she
has
no
name
she
is
older
than
the
amongst
which
she
sits
and
one
certainly
of
her
eyelids
is
a
trifle
weary
and
the
only
answer
to
our
cries
the
only
comment
upon
our
cities
is
that
divine
stare
the
wink
once
twice
thrice
and
then
darkness
iv
boston
and
harvard
it
is
right
to
leave
boston
late
in
a
summer
afternoon
and
by
sea
naval
departure
is
always
the
better
a
train
snatches
you
hot
dusty
and
smoky
with
an
irritated
hurry
out
of
the
back
parts
of
a
town
the
last
glimpse
of
a
place
you
may
have
grown
to
like
or
love
is
ignobly
interminable
rows
of
the
in
mean
streets
a
few
hovels
some
and
a
factory
chimney
as
like
as
not
you
are
reft
from
a
last
wave
to
the
city
unresponsive
and
dingy
back
by
the
roar
and
suffocation
of
a
tunnel
by
sea
one
takes
a
gracefuller
more
satisfactory
farewell
boston
put
on
her
best
appearance
to
watch
our
boat
go
out
for
new
york
the
harbour
was
bright
with
sunlight
and
blue
water
and
little
white
sails
and
there
was
more
than
the
faintest
smell
of
tea
the
city
sat
primly
on
her
little
hills
decorous
civilised
it
is
homely
after
new
york
the
boston
crowd
is
curiously
english
they
have
nice
houses
there
and
ivy
grows
on
the
buildings
and
they
are
hospitable
all
americans
are
hospitable
but
they
have
time
in
new
york
to
practise
the
art
so
perfectly
as
the
bostonians
it
is
a
lovely
art
but
boston
also
makes
you
feel
at
home
without
meaning
to
a
delicious
ancient
toryism
is
to
be
found
here
what
is
wrong
with
america
a
lady
told
me
is
this
they
ought
to
take
the
votes
away
from
these
people
who
do
know
how
to
use
them
and
give
them
only
to
the
educated
my
heart
leapt
the
atlantic
and
was
in
a
cathedral
or
university
town
of
south
england
yet
boston
is
alive
it
sits
in
comfortable
on
the
ruins
of
its
glory
but
it
is
not
buried
beneath
them
it
used
to
lead
america
in
literature
thought
art
everything
the
years
have
passed
it
is
remarkable
how
nearly
now
boston
is
to
new
york
what
munich
is
to
berlin
boston
and
munich
were
the
leaders
forty
years
ago
they
quite
make
out
that
they
are
now
it
is
too
incredible
that
art
should
leave
her
bed
and
away
to
the
and
certainly
if
berlin
and
new
york
are
more
boston
and
munich
are
more
themselves
less
feverishly
imitations
of
paris
but
the
undisputed
palm
is
there
no
more
and
its
absence
is
felt
but
i
had
little
time
to
taste
boston
itself
i
was
lured
across
the
river
to
a
place
called
cambridge
where
is
the
university
of
harvard
harvard
is
the
oxford
and
cambridge
of
america
they
claim
she
has
moulded
the
nation
leaders
and
uttered
its
ideals
harvard
boston
new
england
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
much
they
are
interwoven
and
how
they
have
influenced
america
i
saw
harvard
in
which
is
eights
week
and
may
week
the
festive
of
the
year
a
time
of
parties
and
of
valedictions
one
of
the
great
events
of
commencement
and
of
the
year
is
the
baseball
match
to
this
i
went
excited
at
the
prospect
of
my
first
sight
of
a
game
and
my
mind
vaguely
reminiscent
of
the
indolent
decorous
crowd
the
sunlit
spaces
the
dignified
ritual
and
grace
of
lord
at
the
cricket
match
the
crowd
was
gay
and
not
very
large
we
sat
in
wooden
stands
which
were
placed
in
the
shape
of
a
large
as
all
the
hitting
which
counts
in
baseball
takes
place
well
in
front
of
the
wicket
so
to
speak
the
spectators
have
the
game
right
under
their
noses
the
striker
stands
in
the
angle
of
the
v
and
plays
outwards
the
field
was
a
vast
place
partly
stubbly
grass
partly
worn
and
patchy
like
a
beyond
it
lay
the
river
beyond
that
the
town
of
cambridge
and
the
university
buildings
around
me
were
undergraduates
with
their
mothers
and
sisters
but
there
entered
to
us
across
the
field
a
troop
of
several
hundred
men
all
dressed
in
striped
shirts
of
the
same
hue
and
pattern
and
headed
by
a
vast
banner
which
informed
the
world
that
they
were
the
graduates
of
celebrating
their
triennial
in
military
formation
they
moved
across
the
plain
towards
us
led
by
a
band
ceaselessly
vociferating
and
raising
their
straw
hats
in
unison
to
mark
the
time
there
followed
the
class
of
attired
as
sailors
the
decennial
class
with
some
samples
of
their
male
children
marching
with
them
and
a
banner
inscribed
others
no
race
suicide
carefully
arranged
in
an
formation
dancing
along
to
their
music
with
a
slow
each
with
his
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
the
man
in
front
and
at
the
head
of
all
their
leader
dancing
backwards
in
perfect
time
marshalling
them
men
again
with
some
children
and
a
highland
regiment
playing
the
bagpipes
when
these
had
passed
to
the
seats
allotted
for
them
i
had
time
to
observe
the
players
who
were
practising
about
the
ground
and
i
was
shocked
they
wear
shirts
and
dingy
knickerbockers
fastened
under
the
knee
and
heavy
boots
they
strike
the
english
eye
as
being
attired
for
football
or
a
gladiatorial
combat
rather
than
a
summer
game
the
very
caps
with
large
peaks
give
them
picturesquely
the
appearance
of
hooligans
baseball
is
a
good
game
to
watch
and
in
outline
easy
to
understand
as
it
is
merely
glorified
rounders
a
cricketer
is
fascinated
by
their
rapidity
and
skill
in
catching
and
throwing
there
is
excitement
in
the
game
but
little
beauty
except
in
the
whose
duty
it
is
to
hurl
the
ball
rather
further
than
the
length
of
a
as
bewilderingly
as
possible
in
his
efforts
to
combine
speed
mystery
and
curve
he
gets
into
attitudes
of
a
very
novel
and
fantastic
but
quite
obvious
beauty
nijinsky
would
find
them
repay
study
one
queer
feature
of
this
sport
is
that
unoccupied
members
of
the
batting
side
fielders
and
even
spectators
are
accustomed
to
join
in
vocally
you
have
the
spectacle
of
the
representatives
of
the
universities
endeavouring
to
frustrate
or
unnerve
their
opponents
at
moments
of
excitement
by
cries
of
derision
and
mockery
or
heartening
their
own
supporters
and
performers
with
exclamations
of
joe
or
got
them
or
the
boy
at
the
crises
in
the
fortunes
of
the
game
the
spectators
take
a
collective
and
important
part
the
athletic
committee
appoints
a
for
the
occasion
every
five
or
ten
minutes
this
gentleman
a
big
fine
figure
in
white
springs
out
from
his
seat
at
the
foot
of
the
stands
addresses
the
multitude
through
a
megaphone
with
a
two
three
hurls
it
aside
and
with
a
wild
flinging
and
swinging
of
his
body
and
arms
conducts
ten
thousand
voices
in
the
harvard
yell
that
over
the
game
proceeds
and
the
sits
quietly
waiting
for
the
next
moment
of
peril
or
triumph
i
shall
not
easily
forget
that
figure
bright
in
the
sunshine
conducting
with
his
whole
body
passionate
possessed
by
a
demon
bounding
in
the
frenzy
of
his
inspiration
from
side
to
side
contorted
rhythmic
ecstatic
it
seemed
so
wonderfully
american
in
its
combination
of
entire
wildness
and
entire
regulation
with
the
whole
just
a
trifle
fantastic
completely
friendly
and
befriended
as
i
was
i
could
help
feeling
at
those
moments
very
alien
and
very
very
old
even
more
so
than
after
the
protracted
game
had
ended
in
a
victory
for
harvard
when
the
dusty
plain
was
filled
with
groups
and
lines
of
men
dancing
in
solemn
harmony
and
a
shouting
crowd
broken
by
occasional
individuals
who
could
find
some
little
eminence
to
lead
a
harvard
yell
from
and
who
conducted
the
bystanders
and
then
vanished
and
the
crowd
swirled
on
again
different
enough
was
the
scene
next
day
when
all
harvard
men
who
were
up
for
commencement
assembled
and
arranged
by
years
marched
round
the
yard
class
by
class
they
paraded
beginning
with
veterans
of
the
down
to
the
class
of
i
wonder
if
english
nerves
could
stand
it
it
seems
to
bring
the
passage
of
time
so
very
presently
and
vividly
to
the
mind
to
see
with
such
emphatic
regularity
coevals
changing
in
figure
and
diminishing
in
number
summer
after
summer
perhaps
it
is
nobler
this
deliberate
viewing
of
oneself
as
part
of
the
stream
to
the
spectator
certainly
the
flow
and
transiency
become
apparent
and
poignant
in
five
minutes
fifty
years
of
america
of
so
much
of
america
go
past
one
the
shape
of
the
bodies
apart
from
the
effects
of
age
the
lines
of
the
faces
the
ways
of
wearing
hair
and
beard
and
moustaches
all
these
change
a
little
decade
by
decade
before
your
eyes
and
through
the
whole
appearance
runs
some
continuity
which
is
harvard
the
orderly
progression
of
the
years
was
unbroken
except
at
one
point
there
was
one
gap
large
and
arresting
though
all
years
were
represented
there
seemed
to
be
nobody
in
the
procession
between
fifty
and
sixty
i
asked
a
harvard
friend
the
reason
the
war
he
said
he
told
me
there
had
always
been
that
gap
those
who
were
old
enough
to
be
conscious
of
the
war
had
lost
a
big
piece
of
their
lives
with
their
successors
a
new
america
began
i
do
know
how
true
it
is
certainly
the
dates
worked
out
right
and
i
met
an
american
on
a
boat
who
had
been
a
child
in
one
of
the
neutral
states
he
used
to
watch
the
regiments
forming
in
the
main
street
of
his
town
and
marching
out
some
north
and
some
south
he
said
it
felt
as
though
pieces
of
his
body
were
being
torn
in
different
directions
and
he
was
only
nine
the
procession
filed
in
to
an
open
court
to
hear
the
speeches
of
the
recipients
of
honorary
degrees
and
the
president
annual
statement
there
was
still
in
every
sense
a
solemn
atmosphere
the
speech
floated
out
into
the
great
open
space
fragments
of
it
were
blown
to
one
ears
concerning
deaths
and
the
spirit
of
the
place
and
a
detailed
account
of
the
money
given
during
the
year
eleven
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
all
a
record
or
nearly
a
record
we
roared
applause
the
american
universities
appear
still
to
dream
of
the
things
of
this
world
they
keep
putting
up
the
most
wonderful
and
expensive
buildings
but
they
do
not
pay
their
teachers
well
yet
harvard
is
a
spirit
a
way
of
looking
at
things
austerely
refined
gently
moral
kindly
the
perception
of
it
grows
on
the
foreigner
its
charm
is
so
deliciously
old
in
this
land
so
deliciously
young
compared
with
the
lovely
frowst
of
oxford
and
cambridge
you
see
it
in
temperament
the
charm
of
simplicity
and
and
culture
in
the
harvard
undergraduate
who
is
a
boy
while
his
english
contemporary
is
either
a
young
man
or
a
schoolboy
less
pleasant
stages
and
in
the
old
bostonian
who
heard
and
still
hears
the
lectures
of
dickens
and
thackeray
class
day
brings
so
many
of
that
older
generation
together
they
reveal
what
harvard
what
boston
was
there
is
something
terrifying
in
the
completeness
of
their
lives
and
their
civilisation
they
are
like
a
company
of
dons
whose
studies
are
of
a
remote
and
finished
world
but
the
subject
of
their
scholarship
is
the
victorian
age
and
especially
victorian
england
hence
their
liveliness
and
certainty
greater
than
men
can
reach
who
are
concerned
with
the
dubieties
and
changes
of
incomplete
things
hence
the
wit
the
stock
of
excellent
stories
the
wrinkled
wisdom
and
mirth
of
the
type
they
are
the
flower
of
a
civilisation
its
ripest
critics
and
final
judges
carlyle
and
emerson
are
their
greatest
living
heroes
one
of
them
bent
the
kindliness
and
alert
interest
of
his
eighty
years
upon
me
so
you
come
from
rugby
he
said
tell
me
do
you
know
that
curious
creature
matthew
arnold
i
could
bring
myself
to
tell
him
that
even
in
rugby
we
had
forgiven
that
brilliant
youth
his
iconoclastic
tendencies
some
time
since
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
died
when
i
was
eight
months
old
v
montreal
and
ottawa
my
american
friends
were
full
of
kindly
scorn
when
i
announced
that
i
was
going
to
canada
country
without
a
soul
they
cried
and
pressed
books
upon
me
to
befriend
me
through
that
philistine
bleakness
their
commiseration
unnerved
me
but
i
was
heartened
by
a
feeling
that
i
was
in
a
sense
going
home
and
by
the
romance
of
journeying
there
was
romance
in
the
long
grim
american
train
in
the
great
lake
we
passed
in
the
blackest
of
nights
and
could
just
see
glinting
behind
dark
trees
in
the
negro
in
the
boy
who
perpetually
cried
candy
up
and
down
the
long
carriages
in
the
lofty
box
they
put
me
in
to
sleep
and
in
the
fat
old
lady
who
had
the
berth
under
mine
and
snored
shrilly
the
whole
night
through
there
was
almost
romance
even
in
the
fact
that
after
all
there
was
no
on
the
train
and
having
walked
all
day
in
the
country
i
dined
off
an
orange
i
suppose
an
englishman
in
another
country
if
he
is
simple
enough
is
continually
and
alternately
struck
by
two
thoughts
like
england
this
is
and
unlike
england
this
is
when
i
had
woken
next
morning
and
lying
on
my
back
had
got
inside
my
clothes
with
a
series
of
jumps
i
found
myself
looking
with
startled
eyes
out
of
the
window
at
the
largest
river
i
had
ever
seen
it
was
blue
and
sunlit
and
it
curved
spaciously
but
beyond
that
we
ran
into
the
squalider
parts
of
a
city
it
became
immediately
obvious
that
we
were
not
in
new
york
or
boston
or
any
of
the
more
orderly
the
rather
foreign
cities
of
america
there
was
something
in
the
untidiness
of
those
grimy
houses
the
smoky
disorder
of
the
backyards
that
ran
a
thrill
of
nostalgia
through
me
i
recognised
the
english
way
of
doing
things
with
a
difference
that
i
could
not
define
till
later
determined
to
be
in
all
ways
the
complete
tourist
i
took
a
rough
preliminary
survey
of
montreal
in
an
it
was
a
large
from
which
everything
in
montreal
could
be
seen
in
two
hours
we
were
a
most
fortuitous
band
of
twenty
who
had
elected
so
to
see
it
our
guide
addressed
us
from
the
front
through
a
small
megaphone
telling
us
what
everything
was
what
we
were
to
be
interested
in
what
to
overlook
what
to
admire
he
seemed
the
exact
type
of
a
spiritual
pastor
and
master
shepherding
his
stolid
and
perplexed
flock
on
a
regulated
path
through
the
dust
and
clatter
of
the
world
and
the
great
hollow
device
out
of
which
our
instruction
proceeded
was
so
perfectly
a
blind
mouth
i
had
never
understood
before
we
were
sheepish
enough
and
fairly
hungry
however
we
were
excellently
fed
on
the
right
ladies
and
gentlemen
is
the
bank
of
montreal
on
the
left
the
presbyterian
church
of
st
andrew
on
the
right
again
the
residence
of
sir
blank
blank
further
on
on
the
same
side
the
art
museum
the
outcome
of
it
all
was
a
vague
general
impression
that
montreal
consists
of
banks
and
churches
the
people
of
this
city
spend
much
of
their
time
in
laying
up
their
riches
in
this
world
or
the
next
indeed
the
british
part
of
montreal
is
dominated
by
the
scotch
race
there
is
a
scotch
spirit
sensible
in
the
whole
place
in
the
rather
narrow
rather
gloomy
streets
the
solid
square
grey
aggressively
prosperous
buildings
the
general
greyness
of
the
city
the
air
of
dour
prosperity
even
the
canadian
habit
of
loading
the
streets
with
heavy
telephone
wires
supported
by
frequent
black
poles
seemed
to
increase
the
atmospheric
resemblance
to
glasgow
but
besides
all
this
there
is
a
kind
of
restraint
in
the
air
due
perhaps
to
a
state
of
affairs
which
more
than
any
other
startles
the
ordinary
ignorant
english
visitor
the
average
man
in
england
has
an
idea
of
canada
as
a
daughter
state
composed
of
millions
of
and
backwoodsmen
of
british
race
it
surprises
him
to
learn
that
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
population
is
of
french
descent
that
many
of
them
can
not
speak
english
that
they
control
a
province
form
the
majority
in
the
biggest
city
in
canada
and
are
a
perpetual
complication
in
the
national
politics
even
a
stranger
who
knows
this
is
startled
at
the
complete
separateness
of
the
two
races
is
very
rare
they
do
not
meet
socially
only
on
business
and
that
not
often
in
the
same
city
these
two
communities
dwell
side
by
side
with
different
traditions
different
languages
different
ideals
without
sympathy
or
comprehension
the
french
in
canada
are
entirely
devoted
to
some
say
under
the
thumb
of
the
roman
catholic
church
they
seem
like
a
piece
of
the
middle
ages
dumped
after
a
journey
into
a
quite
uncompromising
example
of
our
commercial
time
some
of
their
leaders
are
said
to
have
dreams
of
a
french
republic
or
theocracy
on
the
banks
of
the
st
lawrence
how
this
or
any
other
solution
of
the
problem
is
to
come
about
no
man
knows
racial
difficulties
are
the
most
enduring
of
all
the
french
and
british
in
canada
seem
to
have
behaved
with
quite
extraordinary
generosity
and
kindliness
towards
each
other
no
one
is
to
blame
but
it
is
not
in
human
nature
that
two
communities
should
live
side
by
side
pretending
they
are
one
without
some
irritation
and
mutual
loss
of
strength
there
is
no
open
strife
but
and
the
memory
of
incidents
bear
continual
witness
to
the
truth
of
the
situation
and
racial
disagreement
is
at
the
bottom
often
unconsciously
of
many
political
and
social
movements
sir
wilfrid
laurier
performed
a
miracle
but
no
one
of
french
birth
will
ever
again
be
premier
of
canada
montreal
and
eastern
canada
suffer
from
that
kind
of
which
afflicts
men
who
are
cases
of
personality
debility
and
spiritual
paralysis
the
man
of
commerce
is
comically
desperate
of
peasants
who
understand
that
increase
of
imports
and
volume
of
trade
and
numbers
of
millionaires
are
the
measures
of
a
city
greatness
and
to
his
eye
the
roman
catholic
church
with
her
invaluable
ally
ignorance
keeps
up
her
incessant
war
against
the
general
good
of
the
community
of
which
she
is
part
so
things
remain
i
made
my
investigations
in
montreal
i
have
to
report
that
the
discobolus
footnote
see
samuel
butler
poem
oh
god
oh
montreal
ed
is
very
well
and
nowadays
looks
the
whole
world
in
the
face
almost
quite
unabashed
west
of
montreal
the
country
seems
to
take
on
a
rather
more
english
appearance
there
is
still
a
french
admixture
but
the
little
houses
are
not
purely
gallic
as
they
are
along
the
lower
st
lawrence
and
once
or
twice
i
detected
real
hedges
ottawa
came
as
a
relief
after
montreal
there
is
no
such
sense
of
strain
and
tightness
in
the
atmosphere
the
british
if
not
greatly
in
the
majority
are
in
the
ascendency
also
the
city
seems
conscious
of
other
than
financial
standards
and
quietly
with
dignity
aware
of
her
own
purpose
the
canadians
like
the
americans
chose
to
have
for
their
capital
a
city
which
did
not
lead
in
population
or
in
wealth
this
is
particularly
fortunate
in
canada
an
extremely
individualistic
country
whose
inhabitants
are
only
just
beginning
to
be
faintly
conscious
of
their
nationality
here
at
least
canada
is
more
than
the
canadian
a
man
desiring
to
praise
ottawa
would
begin
to
do
so
without
statistics
of
wealth
and
the
growth
of
population
and
this
can
be
said
of
no
other
city
in
canada
except
quebec
not
that
there
are
not
immense
and
the
rest
in
ottawa
but
the
government
farm
and
the
parliament
buildings
are
more
important
also
although
the
system
obtains
a
good
deal
in
this
country
the
nucleus
of
the
civil
service
is
much
the
same
as
in
england
so
there
is
an
atmosphere
of
civil
servants
about
ottawa
an
atmosphere
of
safeness
and
honour
and
massive
buildings
and
walks
after
all
there
is
in
the
qualities
of
civility
and
service
much
beauty
of
a
kind
which
would
adorn
canada
parliament
buildings
stand
finely
on
a
headland
of
cliff
some
feet
above
the
river
there
are
gardens
about
them
and
beneath
the
wooded
rocks
go
steeply
down
to
the
water
it
is
a
position
of
natural
boldness
and
significance
the
buildings
were
put
up
in
the
middle
of
last
century
an
unfortunate
period
but
they
have
dignity
especially
of
line
and
when
evening
hides
their
colour
and
the
western
sky
and
the
river
take
on
the
lovely
hues
of
a
canadian
sunset
and
the
lights
begin
to
come
out
in
the
city
they
seem
to
have
the
majesty
and
calm
of
a
natural
crown
of
the
the
government
have
bought
the
ground
along
the
cliff
for
half
a
mile
on
either
side
and
propose
to
build
all
their
offices
there
so
in
the
end
if
they
build
well
the
at
ottawa
will
be
a
noble
sight
and
just
to
show
that
it
is
canada
and
not
utopia
the
line
of
national
buildings
will
always
be
broken
by
an
expensive
and
superb
hotel
the
canadian
pacific
railway
has
been
allowed
to
erect
on
the
twin
and
neighbouring
promontory
to
that
of
the
houses
of
parliament
the
streets
of
ottawa
are
very
quiet
and
shaded
with
trees
the
houses
are
mostly
of
that
cool
homely
wooden
kind
with
verandahs
on
which
or
on
the
steps
the
whole
family
may
sit
in
the
evening
and
observe
the
this
is
possible
for
both
the
rich
and
the
poor
who
live
nearer
each
other
in
ottawa
than
in
most
cities
in
general
there
is
an
air
of
civilisation
which
extends
even
over
the
country
round
but
in
the
country
you
see
little
signs
a
patch
of
swamp
or
thickets
of
still
untouched
primaeval
wood
which
remind
you
that
europeans
have
not
long
had
this
land
i
was
taken
in
a
some
twenty
miles
or
more
over
the
execrable
roads
round
here
to
a
lovely
little
lake
in
the
hills
of
ottawa
we
went
by
little
french
villages
and
fields
at
first
and
then
through
rocky
tangled
woods
of
birch
and
poplar
rich
with
and
blue
cornflowers
and
the
aromatic
thimbleberry
blossom
and
that
romantic
light
flower
which
is
called
fireweed
because
it
is
the
first
vegetation
to
spring
up
in
the
prairie
after
a
fire
has
passed
over
and
so
might
be
adopted
as
the
emblematic
flower
of
a
sense
of
humour
they
told
me
casually
that
there
was
nothing
but
a
few
villages
between
me
and
the
north
pole
it
is
probably
true
of
several
commonly
frequented
places
in
this
country
but
it
gives
a
thrill
to
hear
it
but
what
ottawa
leaves
in
the
mind
is
a
certain
graciousness
dim
for
it
expresses
a
barely
materialised
national
spirit
and
the
sight
of
kindly
faces
and
the
rather
lovely
sound
of
the
soft
canadian
accent
in
the
streets
vi
quebec
and
the
saguenay
the
boat
starts
from
montreal
one
evening
and
lands
you
in
quebec
at
six
next
morning
the
evening
i
left
was
a
dull
one
heavy
sulphurous
clouds
hung
low
over
the
city
drifting
very
slowly
and
gloomily
out
across
the
river
mount
royal
crouched
black
and
sullen
in
the
background
its
crest
occluded
by
the
darkness
appearing
itself
a
cloud
materialised
resting
on
earth
the
harbour
was
filled
with
volumes
of
smoke
purple
and
black
wreathing
and
sidling
eastwards
from
steamers
and
chimneys
the
gigantic
elevators
and
other
harbour
buildings
stood
mistily
in
this
inferno
their
heads
clear
and
sinister
above
the
mirk
it
was
impossible
to
decide
whether
an
enormous
mass
of
pitchy
and
tartarian
gloom
was
being
slowly
moulded
by
diabolic
invisible
hands
into
a
city
or
a
city
the
desperate
and
damned
abode
of
a
loveless
race
was
disintegrating
into
its
proper
fume
and
dusty
chaos
with
relief
we
turned
outwards
to
the
nobility
of
the
st
lawrence
and
the
gathering
dark
on
the
boat
i
fell
in
with
another
wanderer
an
american
jew
and
we
joined
our
fortunes
rather
loosely
for
a
few
days
he
was
one
of
those
men
whom
it
is
a
pleasure
to
remember
i
can
record
his
existence
the
more
easily
that
there
is
not
the
slightest
chance
of
his
ever
reading
these
lines
he
was
a
fat
large
man
of
obviously
in
business
and
probably
of
a
mediocre
success
his
eyes
were
very
small
always
watery
and
perpetually
roving
the
lower
part
of
his
face
was
and
very
broad
his
mouth
wide
with
thin
moist
colourless
lips
his
nose
fat
and
hebraic
he
was
rather
bald
he
had
respect
for
montreal
because
though
closed
to
navigation
for
five
months
in
the
year
it
is
the
second
busiest
port
on
the
coast
he
said
it
had
boston
skinned
the
french
he
disliked
he
thought
they
stood
in
the
way
of
canada
progress
his
mind
was
even
more
childlike
and
transparent
than
is
usual
with
business
men
the
observer
could
see
thoughts
slowly
floating
into
it
like
carp
in
a
pond
when
they
got
near
the
surface
by
a
purely
automatic
process
they
found
utterance
he
was
almost
completely
unconscious
of
an
audience
everything
he
thought
of
he
said
he
told
me
that
his
boots
were
giving
in
the
sole
but
would
probably
last
this
trip
he
said
he
had
not
washed
his
feet
for
eight
days
and
that
his
clothes
were
shabby
which
was
true
but
would
do
for
canada
it
was
interesting
to
see
how
canada
presented
herself
to
that
mind
he
seemed
to
regard
her
as
a
kind
of
boeotia
and
terrifyingly
dour
these
canadian
waiters
he
said
they
jes
the
food
in
face
gets
yer
sick
does
it
i
agreed
there
was
a
yorkshire
mechanic
too
who
had
been
in
canada
four
years
and
preferred
it
to
england
because
you
room
to
breathe
but
also
found
that
canada
had
not
yet
learnt
social
comfort
and
regretted
the
manners
of
the
old
country
we
woke
to
find
ourselves
sweeping
round
a
high
cliff
at
six
in
the
morning
with
a
lively
breeze
the
river
very
blue
and
broken
into
ripples
and
a
lot
of
little
white
clouds
in
the
sky
the
air
was
full
of
gaiety
and
sunshine
and
the
sense
of
the
singing
of
birds
though
actually
i
think
there
were
only
a
few
gulls
crying
it
was
the
perfection
of
a
summer
morning
thrilling
with
a
freshness
which
the
fancy
said
was
keener
than
any
the
old
world
knew
and
high
and
grey
and
serene
above
the
morning
lay
the
citadel
of
quebec
is
there
any
city
in
the
world
that
stands
so
nobly
as
quebec
the
citadel
crowns
a
headland
three
hundred
feet
high
that
juts
boldly
out
into
the
st
lawrence
up
to
it
up
the
side
of
the
hill
clambers
the
city
houses
and
steeples
and
huts
piled
one
on
the
other
it
has
the
individuality
and
the
pride
of
a
city
where
great
things
have
happened
and
over
which
many
years
have
passed
quebec
is
as
refreshing
and
as
definite
after
the
other
cities
of
this
continent
as
an
immortal
among
a
crowd
of
stockbrokers
she
has
indeed
the
radiance
and
repose
of
an
immortal
but
she
wears
her
immortality
youthfully
when
you
get
among
the
streets
of
quebec
the
mediaeval
precipitous
narrow
winding
and
perplexed
streets
you
begin
to
realise
her
charm
she
almost
incurs
the
charge
of
quaintness
abhorrent
quality
but
even
quaintness
becomes
attractive
in
this
country
you
are
in
a
foreign
land
for
the
people
have
an
alien
tongue
short
stature
the
quick
decided
cinematographic
quality
of
movement
and
the
inexplicable
cheerfulness
which
mark
a
foreigner
you
might
almost
be
in
siena
or
some
old
german
town
except
that
quebec
has
her
and
to
show
that
she
is
living
the
american
jew
and
i
took
a
a
little
local
carriage
driven
by
a
lively
frenchman
with
a
factitious
passion
for
and
churches
a
small
black
and
white
spaniel
followed
the
yapping
the
american
face
shone
with
interest
that
dawg
michael
he
said
the
hotel
dawg
he
a
queer
little
dawg
i
kicked
his
face
and
he
tried
to
bite
me
hup
michael
and
he
laughed
hoarsely
non
said
the
driver
suddenly
it
is
not
the
dog
the
american
did
not
lose
interest
these
little
dawgs
are
all
alike
he
said
dare
say
if
you
kicked
that
dawg
in
the
face
he
bite
you
hup
michael
with
that
he
fell
into
deep
thought
we
rattled
up
and
down
the
steep
streets
out
among
tidy
fields
and
back
into
the
noisily
sedate
city
again
we
saw
where
wolfe
fell
where
montcalm
fell
where
montgomery
fell
children
played
where
the
tides
of
war
had
ebbed
and
flowed
mr
norman
angell
and
his
friends
tell
us
that
trade
is
superseding
war
and
pacifists
declare
that
for
the
future
countries
will
win
their
pride
or
shame
from
commercial
treaties
and
tariffs
and
bounties
and
no
more
from
battles
and
sieges
and
there
is
a
part
of
canadian
patriotism
that
has
progressed
this
way
but
i
wonder
if
the
hearts
of
that
remarkable
race
posterity
will
ever
beat
the
harder
when
they
are
told
here
mr
borden
stood
when
he
decided
to
double
the
duty
on
agricultural
implements
or
even
in
this
room
mr
ritchie
conceived
the
plan
of
removing
the
shilling
on
wheat
when
that
happens
quebec
will
be
a
forgotten
ruin
the
reverie
was
broken
by
my
friend
struggling
to
his
feet
and
standing
unsteady
and
bareheaded
in
the
swaying
carriage
in
that
position
he
burst
hoarsely
into
a
song
that
i
recognised
as
banner
we
were
passing
the
american
consulate
his
song
over
he
settled
down
and
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
and
the
jolted
down
even
narrower
streets
curiously
paved
with
planks
and
ways
that
led
through
and
under
the
ancient
tottering
wooden
houses
but
quebec
is
too
real
a
city
to
be
in
such
a
manner
and
a
better
way
of
spending
a
few
days
or
years
is
to
sit
on
dufferin
terrace
with
the
old
lower
town
sheer
beneath
you
and
the
river
beyond
it
and
the
citadel
to
the
right
a
little
above
and
the
isle
of
orleans
and
the
french
villages
away
to
your
left
hour
by
hour
the
colours
change
and
sunlight
follows
shadow
and
mist
rises
and
smoke
drifts
across
and
through
the
veil
of
the
shifting
of
lights
and
hues
there
remains
visible
the
majesty
of
the
most
glorious
river
in
the
world
from
this
contemplation
and
from
musing
on
men
agreement
to
mark
by
this
one
great
sign
of
the
taking
of
the
heights
of
quebec
the
turning
of
one
of
the
greatest
currents
in
our
history
i
was
torn
by
a
journey
i
had
been
advised
to
make
the
boat
goes
some
hundred
and
thirty
miles
down
the
st
lawrence
turns
up
a
northern
tributary
the
saguenay
goes
as
far
as
chicoutimi
ninety
miles
up
and
returns
to
quebec
both
on
this
trip
and
between
quebec
and
montreal
we
touched
at
many
little
french
villages
by
day
and
by
night
their
the
peasants
are
a
jolly
sight
they
are
like
children
in
their
noisy
content
they
are
poor
and
happy
roman
catholics
they
laugh
a
great
deal
and
they
continually
sing
they
do
not
progress
at
all
as
a
counter
to
these
admirable
people
we
had
on
our
boat
a
great
many
priests
they
diffused
an
atmosphere
of
black
of
unpleasant
melancholy
their
faces
had
that
curiously
unwashed
look
and
were
for
the
most
part
of
a
mean
and
very
untrustworthy
expression
their
eyes
were
small
shifty
and
cruel
and
would
not
meet
the
gaze
the
choice
between
our
own
age
and
mediaeval
times
is
a
very
hard
one
it
was
almost
full
night
when
we
left
the
width
of
the
st
lawrence
and
turned
up
a
gloomy
inlet
by
reason
of
the
night
and
of
comparison
with
the
river
from
which
we
had
come
this
stream
appeared
unnaturally
narrow
darkness
hid
all
detail
and
we
were
only
aware
of
vast
cliffs
sometimes
dense
with
trees
sometimes
bare
faces
of
sullen
rock
they
shut
us
in
oppressively
but
without
heat
there
are
no
banks
to
this
river
for
the
most
part
only
these
walls
rising
sheer
from
the
water
to
the
height
of
two
thousand
feet
going
down
sheer
beneath
it
or
rather
by
the
side
of
it
to
many
times
that
depth
the
water
was
of
some
colour
blacker
than
black
even
by
daylight
it
is
inky
and
sinister
it
flows
without
foam
or
ripple
no
white
showed
in
the
wake
of
the
boat
the
ominous
shores
were
without
sign
of
life
save
for
a
rare
light
every
few
miles
to
mark
some
bend
in
the
chasm
once
a
canoe
with
two
indians
shot
out
of
the
shadows
passed
under
our
stern
and
vanished
silently
down
stream
we
all
became
hushed
and
apprehensive
the
night
was
gigantic
and
terrible
there
were
a
few
stars
but
the
flood
slid
along
too
swiftly
to
reflect
them
the
whole
scene
seemed
some
stygian
imagination
of
dante
as
we
drew
further
and
further
into
that
lightless
land
little
twists
and
curls
of
vapour
wriggled
over
the
black
our
homeless
irrelevant
tiny
steamer
seemed
to
hang
between
two
abysms
one
became
suddenly
aware
of
the
miles
of
dark
water
beneath
i
found
that
under
a
prolonged
gaze
the
face
of
the
river
began
to
writhe
and
eddy
as
if
from
some
horrible
suppressed
emotion
it
seemed
likely
that
something
might
appear
i
reflected
that
if
the
river
failed
us
all
hope
was
gone
and
that
anyhow
this
region
was
the
abode
of
devils
i
went
to
bed
next
day
we
steamed
down
the
river
again
by
daylight
some
of
the
horror
goes
but
the
impression
of
ancientness
and
desolation
remains
the
gloomy
flood
is
entirely
shut
in
by
the
rock
or
the
tangled
pine
and
birch
forests
of
these
great
cliffs
except
in
one
or
two
places
where
a
chine
and
a
beach
have
given
lodging
to
lonely
villages
one
of
these
is
at
the
end
of
a
long
bay
called
bay
the
local
an
early
example
of
the
school
of
fantastic
realism
so
popular
among
our
younger
novelists
says
that
this
name
arose
from
the
ejaculations
of
the
early
french
explorers
who
had
mistaken
this
lengthy
for
the
main
stream
ha
they
said
so
like
an
early
explorer
at
the
point
where
the
saguenay
joins
the
st
lawrence
here
twenty
miles
wide
i
off
for
a
day
to
feel
the
country
more
deeply
the
village
is
called
tadousac
and
consists
of
an
hotel
and
french
fishermen
to
whom
quebec
is
a
distant
unvisited
city
of
legend
the
afternoon
was
very
hot
i
wandered
out
along
a
thin
margin
of
yellow
sand
to
the
extreme
rocky
point
where
the
waters
of
the
two
rivers
meet
and
swirl
there
i
lay
and
looked
at
the
strange
humps
of
the
laurentian
hills
and
the
dark
green
masses
of
the
woods
impenetrable
depths
of
straight
and
leaning
and
horizontal
trees
broken
here
and
there
by
great
bald
granite
rocks
and
behind
me
the
little
village
where
the
earliest
church
in
canada
stands
away
in
the
st
lawrence
there
would
be
a
flash
as
an
immense
white
fish
jumped
miles
out
an
occasional
steamer
passed
bound
to
england
perhaps
and
once
hugging
the
coast
came
a
paddling
a
canoe
with
a
small
sail
filled
with
trout
the
cliff
above
me
was
crowned
with
beds
of
blue
flowers
whose
names
i
did
not
know
against
the
little
gulfs
and
coasts
of
rock
at
my
feet
were
washing
a
few
white
logs
of
driftwood
i
wondered
if
they
could
have
floated
across
from
england
or
if
they
could
be
from
the
the
sun
was
very
hot
the
sky
a
clear
light
blue
almost
cloudless
like
an
english
sky
and
the
water
seemed
fairly
deep
i
stripped
hovered
a
while
on
the
brink
and
plunged
the
current
was
unexpectedly
strong
i
seemed
to
feel
that
body
of
black
water
moving
against
me
and
it
was
cold
as
death
stray
shreds
of
the
st
lawrence
water
were
warm
and
cheerful
but
the
current
of
the
saguenay
on
such
a
day
seemed
unnaturally
icy
as
my
head
came
up
i
made
one
dash
for
the
land
scrambled
out
on
the
hot
rocks
and
lay
there
panting
then
i
dried
on
a
handkerchief
dressed
and
ran
back
home
still
shivering
through
the
woods
to
the
hotel
vii
ontario
the
great
joy
of
travelling
in
canada
is
to
do
it
by
water
the
advantage
of
this
is
that
you
can
keep
fairly
clean
and
quiet
of
nerves
the
disadvantage
is
that
you
do
the
country
i
travelled
most
of
the
way
from
ottawa
to
toronto
by
water
but
between
ottawa
and
prescott
then
and
later
from
toronto
to
niagara
falls
and
thence
to
sarnia
there
is
a
good
deal
of
southern
ontario
to
be
seen
the
part
which
has
counted
as
ontario
so
far
and
i
saw
it
through
a
faint
mist
of
for
after
the
states
and
after
quebec
it
is
english
there
are
rolling
country
thickets
of
trees
little
hills
green
and
grey
in
the
distance
decorous
small
fields
orchards
and
i
swear
a
hedge
or
two
most
of
the
towns
we
went
through
are
a
little
too
vivacious
or
too
pert
to
be
european
but
there
seemed
to
be
real
villages
occasionally
and
the
land
had
a
quiet
air
of
occupation
men
have
lived
contentedly
on
this
land
and
died
where
they
were
born
and
so
given
it
a
certain
sanctity
away
north
the
wild
begins
and
is
only
now
being
brought
into
civilisation
inhabited
made
productive
explored
and
exploited
but
this
country
has
seen
the
generations
pass
and
won
something
of
that
repose
and
security
which
countries
acquire
from
the
sight
the
wise
traveller
from
ottawa
to
toronto
catches
a
boat
at
prescott
and
puffs
judicially
between
two
nations
up
the
st
lawrence
and
across
lake
ontario
we
were
a
cosmopolitan
bunch
it
is
the
one
distinction
between
the
canadian
and
american
languages
that
canadians
tend
to
say
but
americans
out
to
enjoy
the
scenery
for
this
stretch
of
the
river
is
notoriously
picturesque
containing
the
thousand
isles
the
thousand
isles
vary
from
six
inches
to
hundreds
of
yards
in
diameter
each
if
big
enough
has
been
bought
by
a
rich
man
generally
an
american
who
has
built
a
castle
on
it
so
the
whole
is
much
more
beautiful
than
golder
green
we
picked
our
way
carefully
between
the
islands
the
americans
on
board
sat
in
rows
saying
that
house
was
built
by
mr
made
his
money
in
biscuits
cost
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
building
yessir
the
canadians
sat
looking
out
the
other
way
and
said
in
this
land
was
worth
twenty
thousand
an
acre
now
it
worth
thousand
next
year
and
their
eyes
grew
solemn
as
the
eyes
of
men
who
think
deep
and
holy
thoughts
but
the
english
sat
quite
still
looking
straight
in
front
of
them
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
and
hoping
that
nobody
would
speak
to
them
so
we
fared
until
well
on
in
the
afternoon
we
came
to
the
entrance
of
lake
ontario
there
is
something
ominous
and
unnatural
about
these
great
lakes
the
sweet
flow
of
a
river
and
the
unfriendly
restless
vitality
of
the
sea
men
may
know
and
love
and
the
little
lakes
we
have
in
europe
are
but
as
streams
that
have
married
and
settled
down
alive
and
healthy
and
comprehensible
rivers
except
the
saguenay
are
human
the
sea
very
properly
will
not
be
allowed
in
heaven
it
has
no
soul
it
is
unvintageable
cruel
treacherous
what
you
will
but
in
the
end
while
we
have
it
with
us
it
is
all
right
even
though
that
result
but
as
with
france
from
the
recognition
of
an
feud
and
an
irremediable
lack
of
sympathy
but
these
monstrous
lakes
which
ape
the
ocean
are
not
proper
to
fresh
water
or
salt
they
have
souls
perceptibly
and
wicked
ones
we
steamed
out
that
day
over
a
flat
stationary
mass
of
water
smooth
with
the
smoothness
of
metal
or
polished
stone
or
one
there
was
a
slight
haze
everywhere
the
lake
was
a
terrible
colour
the
gleam
of
its
surface
shot
with
flecks
of
blue
and
a
vapoury
it
was
like
a
gigantic
silver
shield
its
glint
was
inexplicably
sinister
and
dead
like
the
glint
on
glasses
worn
by
a
blind
man
in
front
the
steely
mist
hid
the
horizon
so
that
the
occasional
rock
or
little
island
and
the
one
ship
in
sight
seemed
hung
in
air
they
were
reflected
to
a
preternatural
length
in
the
glassy
floor
our
boat
appeared
to
leave
no
wake
those
strange
waters
closed
up
foamlessly
behind
her
but
our
black
smoke
hung
away
back
on
the
trail
in
a
thick
cloud
becalmed
in
the
hot
windless
air
very
close
over
the
water
like
an
evil
soul
after
death
that
can
not
win
dissolution
behind
us
and
to
the
right
lay
the
low
woody
shores
of
southern
ontario
and
prince
edward
peninsula
long
dark
lines
of
green
stretching
thinner
and
thinner
interminably
into
the
distance
the
lake
around
us
was
dull
though
the
sun
shone
full
on
it
it
gleamed
but
without
radiance
toronto
pronounce
please
is

it

it

not

pardoned
the
by

such
is
toronto
a
brisk
city
of
getting
on
for
half
a
million
inhabitants
the
largest
british
city
in
canada
in
spite
of
the
cheery
italian
faces
that
pop
up
at
you
out
of
excavations
in
the
street
liberally
endowed
with
millionaires
not
lacking
its
due
share
of
destitution
misery
and
slums
it
is
no
mushroom
city
of
the
west
it
has
its
history
but
at
the
same
time
it
has
grown
immensely
of
recent
years
it
is
situated
on
the
shores
of
a
lovely
lake
but
you
never
see
that
because
the
railways
have
occupied
the
entire
lake
front
so
if
at
evening
you
try
to
find
your
way
to
the
edge
of
the
water
you
are
checked
by
a
region
of
smoke
sheds
trucks
wharves
signals
and
locomotives
and
trains
that
wander
on
the
tracks
up
and
down
and
across
streets
pushing
their
way
through
the
pedestrians
and
tolling
as
they
go
in
the
american
fashion
an
immense
melancholy
bell
intent
apparently
on
some
private
and
incommunicable
grief
higher
up
are
the
business
quarters
a
few
in
the
american
style
without
the
modern
american
beauty
but
one
of
which
advertises
itself
as
the
highest
in
the
british
empire
streets
that
seem
less
narrow
than
montreal
but
not
unrespectably
wide
the
buildings
are
generally
substantial
and
often
handsome
the
too
kindly
herr
baedeker
beyond
that
the
residential
part
with
quiet
streets
gardens
open
to
the
road
shady
verandahs
and
homes
generally
of
wood
that
are
a
deal
more
pleasant
to
see
than
the
houses
in
a
modern
english
town
toronto
is
the
centre
and
heart
of
the
province
of
ontario
and
ontario
with
a
third
of
the
whole
population
of
canada
directs
the
country
for
the
present
conditioned
by
the
french
on
one
hand
and
the
west
on
the
other
and
in
this
land
that
is
as
yet
hardly
at
all
conscious
of
itself
as
a
nation
toronto
and
ontario
do
their
best
in
leading
and
realising
national
sentiment
a
toronto
man
like
most
canadians
dislikes
an
englishman
but
unlike
some
canadians
he
detests
an
american
and
he
has
some
inkling
of
the
conditions
and
responsibilities
of
the
british
empire
the
tradition
is
in
him
his
fathers
fought
to
keep
canada
british
it
is
never
easy
to
pick
out
of
the
turmoil
of
an
election
the
real
powers
that
have
moved
men
and
it
is
especially
difficult
in
a
country
where
politics
are
so
corrupt
as
they
are
in
canada
but
certainly
this
british
feeling
helped
to
throw
ontario
and
so
the
country
against
reciprocity
with
the
united
states
in
and
it
is
keeping
it
in
the
comedy
of
the
navy
question
on
mr
borden
side
rather
from
distrust
of
his
opponents
sincerity
perhaps
than
from
admiration
of
the
fix
he
is
in
it
has
been
used
this
patriotism
to
aid
the
wealthy
interests
which
are
here
and
it
will
continue
to
be
a
ball
in
the
tennis
of
party
politics
but
it
is
real
it
will
remain
potential
of
good
among
all
the
forces
that
are
certain
for
evil
toronto
soul
of
canada
is
wealthy
busy
commercial
scotch
absorbent
of
whisky
but
she
is
duly
aware
of
other
things
she
has
a
most
modern
and
efficient
interest
in
education
and
here
are
gathered
what
faint
faint
beginnings
or
premonitions
of
such
things
as
art
canada
can
boast
except
the
who
it
is
complained
produce
disproportionately
much
literature
and
waste
their
time
on
their
own
unprofitable
songs
most
of
those
few
who
have
begun
to
paint
the
landscape
of
canada
centre
there
and
a
handful
of
people
who
know
about
books
in
these
things
as
in
all
this
city
is
properly
and
cheerfully
to
the
front
it
can
scarcely
be
doubted
that
the
first
repertory
theatre
in
canada
will
be
founded
in
toronto
some
thirty
years
hence
and
will
very
daringly
perform
and
silver
canada
is
a
live
country
live
but
not
like
the
states
kicking
in
these
trifles
of
art
and
indeed
she
is
much
handicapped
by
the
proximity
of
the
states
for
her
poets
and
writers
are
apt
to
be
drawn
thither
for
the
better
companionship
there
and
the
higher
rates
of
pay
but
toronto
toronto
is
the
subject
one
must
say
something
must
one
say
about
toronto
what
can
one
what
has
anybody
ever
said
it
is
impossible
to
give
it
anything
but
commendation
it
is
not
squalid
like
birmingham
or
cramped
like
canton
or
scattered
like
edmonton
or
sham
like
berlin
or
hellish
like
new
york
or
tiresome
like
nice
it
is
all
right
the
only
depressing
thing
is
that
it
will
always
be
what
it
is
only
larger
and
that
no
canadian
city
can
ever
be
anything
better
or
different
if
they
are
good
they
may
become
toronto
viii
niagara
falls
samuel
butler
has
a
lot
to
answer
for
but
for
him
a
modern
traveller
could
spend
his
time
peacefully
admiring
the
scenery
instead
of
feeling
himself
bound
to
dog
the
simple
and
grotesque
of
the
world
for
the
sake
of
their
comments
it
is
his
fault
if
a
peasant
has
come
to
outweigh
the
beauty
of
rivers
and
the
remarks
of
clergymen
are
more
than
mountains
it
is
very
restful
to
give
up
all
effort
at
observing
human
nature
and
drawing
social
and
political
deductions
from
trifles
and
to
let
oneself
relapse
into
worship
of
the
wonders
of
nature
and
this
is
very
easy
at
niagara
niagara
means
nothing
it
is
not
leading
anywhere
it
does
not
result
from
anything
it
throws
no
light
on
the
effects
of
protection
nor
on
the
facility
for
divorce
in
america
nor
on
corruption
in
public
life
nor
on
canadian
character
nor
even
on
the
navy
bill
it
is
merely
a
great
deal
of
water
falling
over
some
cliffs
but
it
is
very
remarkably
that
the
human
race
apt
as
a
child
to
destroy
what
it
admires
has
done
its
best
to
surround
the
falls
with
every
distraction
incongruity
and
vulgarity
hotels
bridges
trams
picture
sham
legends
stalls
booths
and
frame
them
about
and
there
are
touts
niagara
is
the
central
home
and
for
all
the
touts
of
earth
there
are
touts
insinuating
and
touts
raucous
greasy
touts
brazen
touts
and
refined
gentlemanly
touts
touts
who
intimidate
and
touts
who
wheedle
professionals
amateurs
and
male
and
female
touts
who
would
photograph
you
with
your
arm
round
a
young
lady
against
a
faked
background
of
the
sublimest
cataract
touts
who
would
bully
you
into
cars
elevators
or
tunnels
or
deceive
you
into
a
carriage
and
pair
touts
who
would
sell
you
picture
postcards
moccasins
sham
indian
beadwork
blankets
and
crockery
and
touts
finally
who
have
no
apparent
object
in
the
world
but
just
purely
simply
merely
incessantly
indefatigably
and
ineffugibly
to
tout
and
in
the
midst
of
all
this
overwhelming
it
all
are
the
falls
he
who
sees
them
instantly
forgets
humanity
they
are
not
very
high
but
they
are
overpowering
they
are
divided
by
an
island
into
two
parts
the
canadian
and
the
american
half
a
mile
or
so
above
the
falls
on
either
side
the
water
of
the
great
stream
begins
to
run
more
swiftly
and
in
confusion
it
descends
with
speed
it
begins
chattering
and
leaping
breaking
into
a
thousand
ripples
throwing
up
joyful
fingers
of
spray
sometimes
it
is
divided
by
islands
and
rocks
sometimes
the
eye
can
see
nothing
but
a
waste
of
laughing
springing
foamy
waves
turning
crossing
even
seeming
to
stand
for
an
instant
erect
but
always
borne
impetuously
forward
like
a
crowd
of
triumphant
feasters
sit
close
down
by
it
and
you
see
a
fragment
of
the
torrent
against
the
sky
mottled
steely
and
foaming
leaping
onward
in
strands
of
water
perpetually
the
eye
is
on
the
point
of
descrying
a
pattern
in
this
weaving
and
perpetually
it
is
cheated
by
change
in
one
place
part
of
the
flood
plunges
over
a
ledge
a
few
feet
high
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
long
in
a
uniform
and
stable
curve
it
gives
an
impression
of
almost
military
concerted
movement
grown
suddenly
out
of
confusion
but
it
is
swiftly
lost
again
in
the
multitudinous
tossing
merriment
here
and
there
a
rock
close
to
the
surface
is
marked
by
a
white
wave
that
faces
backwards
and
seems
to
be
rushing
madly
but
is
really
stationary
in
the
headlong
charge
but
for
these
signs
of
reluctance
the
waters
seem
to
fling
themselves
on
with
some
foreknowledge
of
their
fate
in
an
ever
wilder
frenzy
but
it
is
no
maeterlinckian
prescience
they
prove
rather
that
greek
belief
that
the
great
crashes
are
preceded
by
a
louder
merriment
and
a
wilder
gaiety
leaping
in
the
sunlight
careless
entwining
clamorously
joyful
the
waves
riot
on
towards
the
verge
but
there
they
change
as
they
turn
to
the
sheer
descent
the
white
and
blue
and
in
the
heart
of
the
canadian
falls
at
least
blend
and
deepen
to
a
rich
wonderful
luminous
green
on
the
edge
of
disaster
the
river
seems
to
gather
herself
to
pause
to
lift
a
head
noble
in
ruin
and
then
with
a
slow
grandeur
to
plunge
into
the
eternal
thunder
and
white
chaos
below
where
the
stream
runs
shallower
it
is
a
kind
of
violet
colour
but
both
violet
and
green
fray
and
frill
to
white
as
they
fall
the
mass
of
water
striking
some
base
of
rock
leaps
up
the
whole
two
hundred
feet
again
in
pinnacles
and
domes
of
spray
the
spray
falls
back
into
the
lower
river
once
more
all
but
a
little
that
fines
to
foam
and
white
mist
which
drifts
in
layers
along
the
air
graining
it
and
wanders
out
on
the
wind
over
the
trees
and
gardens
and
houses
and
so
vanishes
the
manager
of
one
of
the
great
on
the
banks
of
the
river
above
the
falls
told
me
that
the
centre
of
the
riverbed
at
the
canadian
falls
is
deep
and
of
a
saucer
shape
so
it
may
be
possible
to
fill
this
up
to
a
uniform
depth
and
divert
a
lot
of
water
for
the
and
this
he
said
would
supply
the
need
for
more
power
which
will
certainly
soon
arise
without
taking
away
from
the
beauty
of
niagara
this
is
a
handsome
concession
of
the
utilitarians
to
ordinary
yet
i
doubt
if
we
shall
be
satisfied
the
real
secret
of
the
beauty
and
terror
of
the
falls
is
not
their
height
or
width
but
the
feeling
of
colossal
power
and
of
unintelligible
disaster
caused
by
the
plunge
of
that
vast
body
of
water
if
that
were
taken
away
there
would
be
little
visible
change
but
the
heart
would
be
gone
the
american
falls
do
not
inspire
this
feeling
in
the
same
way
as
the
canadian
it
is
because
they
are
less
in
volume
and
because
the
water
does
not
fall
so
much
into
one
place
by
comparison
their
beauty
is
almost
delicate
and
fragile
they
are
extraordinarily
level
one
long
curtain
of
lacework
and
woven
foam
seen
from
opposite
when
the
sun
is
on
them
they
are
blindingly
white
and
the
clouds
of
spray
show
dark
against
them
with
both
falls
the
colour
of
the
water
is
the
wonder
greens
and
blues
purples
and
whites
melt
into
one
another
fade
and
come
again
and
change
with
the
changing
sun
sometimes
they
are
as
richly
diaphanous
as
a
precious
stone
and
glow
from
within
with
a
deep
inexplicable
light
sometimes
the
white
intricacies
of
dropping
foam
become
opaque
and
creamy
and
always
there
are
the
rainbows
if
you
come
suddenly
upon
the
falls
from
above
a
great
double
rainbow
very
vivid
spanning
the
extent
of
spray
from
top
to
bottom
is
the
first
thing
you
see
if
you
wander
along
the
cliff
opposite
a
bow
springs
into
being
in
the
american
falls
accompanies
you
courteously
on
your
walk
dwindles
and
dies
as
the
mist
ends
and
awakens
again
as
you
reach
the
canadian
tumult
and
the
bold
traveller
who
attempts
the
trip
under
the
american
falls
sees
when
he
dare
open
his
eyes
to
anything
tiny
baby
rainbows
some
four
or
five
yards
in
span
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
among
the
foam
and
gambolling
beside
him
barely
out
of
hand
reach
as
he
goes
one
i
saw
in
that
place
was
a
complete
circle
such
as
i
have
never
seen
before
and
so
near
that
i
could
put
my
foot
on
it
it
is
a
terrifying
journey
beneath
and
behind
the
falls
the
senses
are
battered
and
bewildered
by
the
thunder
of
the
water
and
the
assault
of
wind
and
spray
or
rather
the
sound
is
not
of
falling
water
but
merely
of
falling
a
noise
of
unspecified
ruin
so
if
you
are
close
behind
the
endless
clamour
the
sight
can
not
recognise
liquid
in
the
masses
that
hurl
past
you
are
dimly
and
pitifully
aware
that
sheets
of
light
and
darkness
are
falling
in
great
curves
in
front
of
you
dull
omnipresent
foam
washes
the
face
farther
away
in
the
roar
and
hissing
clouds
of
spray
seem
literally
to
slide
down
some
invisible
plane
of
air
beyond
the
foot
of
the
falls
the
river
is
like
a
slipping
floor
of
marble
green
with
veins
of
dirty
white
made
by
the
scum
that
was
foam
it
slides
very
quietly
and
slowly
down
for
a
mile
or
two
sullenly
exhausted
then
it
turns
to
a
dull
sage
green
and
hurries
more
swiftly
smooth
and
ominous
as
the
walls
of
the
ravine
close
in
trouble
stirs
and
the
waters
boil
and
eddy
these
are
the
lower
rapids
a
sight
more
terrifying
than
the
falls
because
less
intelligible
close
in
its
bands
of
rock
the
river
surges
tumultuously
forward
writhing
and
leaping
as
if
inspired
by
a
demon
it
is
pressed
by
the
straits
into
a
visibly
convex
form
great
planes
of
water
slide
past
sometimes
it
is
thrown
up
into
a
pinnacle
of
foam
higher
than
a
house
or
leaps
with
incredible
speed
from
the
crest
of
one
vast
wave
to
another
along
the
shining
curve
between
like
the
spring
of
a
wild
beast
its
motion
continually
suggests
muscular
action
the
power
manifest
in
these
rapids
moves
one
with
a
different
sense
of
awe
and
terror
from
that
of
the
falls
here
the
inhuman
life
and
strength
are
spontaneous
active
almost
resolute
masculine
vigour
compared
with
the
passive
gigantic
power
female
helpless
and
overwhelming
of
the
falls
a
place
of
fear
one
is
drawn
back
strangely
to
a
contemplation
of
the
falls
at
every
hour
and
especially
by
night
when
the
cloud
of
spray
becomes
an
immense
visible
ghost
straining
and
wavering
high
above
the
river
white
and
pathetic
and
translucent
the
victorian
lies
very
close
below
the
surface
in
every
man
there
one
can
sit
and
let
great
cloudy
thoughts
of
destiny
and
the
passage
of
empires
drift
through
the
mind
for
such
dreams
are
at
home
by
niagara
i
could
not
get
out
of
my
mind
the
thought
of
a
friend
who
said
that
the
rainbows
over
the
falls
were
like
the
arts
and
beauty
and
goodness
with
regard
to
the
stream
of
life
caused
by
it
thrown
upon
its
spray
but
unable
to
stay
or
direct
or
affect
it
and
ceasing
when
it
ceased
in
all
comparisons
that
rise
in
the
heart
the
river
with
its
multitudinous
waves
and
its
single
current
likens
itself
to
a
life
whether
of
an
individual
or
of
a
community
a
man
life
is
of
many
flashing
moments
and
yet
one
stream
a
nation
flows
through
all
its
citizens
and
yet
is
more
than
they
in
such
places
one
is
aware
with
an
almost
insupportable
and
yet
comforting
certitude
that
both
men
and
nations
are
hurried
onwards
to
their
ruin
or
ending
as
inevitably
as
this
dark
flood
some
go
down
to
it
unreluctant
and
meet
it
like
the
river
not
without
nobility
and
as
incessant
as
inevitable
and
as
unavailing
as
the
spray
that
hangs
over
the
falls
is
the
white
cloud
of
human
crying
with
some
such
thoughts
does
the
platitudinous
heart
win
from
the
confusion
and
thunder
of
niagara
a
peace
that
the
quietest
plains
or
most
stable
hills
can
never
give
ix
to
winnipeg
the
boats
that
run
from
sarnia
the
whole
length
of
lake
huron
and
lake
superior
are
not
comfortable
but
no
doubt
a
train
for
those
six
hundred
miles
would
be
worse
you
start
one
afternoon
and
in
the
morning
of
the
next
day
you
have
done
with
the
rather
colourless
unindividual
expanses
of
huron
and
are
dawdling
along
a
canal
that
joins
the
lakes
by
the
little
town
of
sault
ste
marie
pronounced
abruptly
we
happened
on
it
one
sunday
the
nearer
waters
of
the
river
and
the
lakes
were
covered
with
little
sailing
or
rowing
or
bathing
parties
everybody
seemed
cheerful
merry
and
mildly
raucous
there
is
a
fine
breezy
enviable
healthiness
about
canadian
life
except
in
some
eastern
cities
there
are
few
clerks
or
but
can
get
away
to
the
woods
and
water
as
we
drew
out
into
the
cold
magnificence
of
lake
superior
the
receding
woody
shores
were
occasionally
spotted
with
picnickers
or
campers
who
rushed
down
the
beach
in
various
deshabille
waving
towels
handkerchiefs
or
garments
we
were
as
friendly
the
human
race
seemed
a
jolly
bunch
and
the
world
a
fine
pleasant
affair
world
in
fact
a
man
in
a
red
shirt
and
a
bronzed
girl
with
flowing
hair
slid
past
in
a
canoe
we
whistled
sang
and
cried
and
other
words
of
occult
meaning
which
imputed
love
to
them
and
foolishness
they
replied
suitably
grinned
and
were
gone
a
little
old
lady
in
black
in
the
chair
next
mine
kept
a
small
telescope
glued
to
her
eye
hour
after
hour
whenever
she
distinguished
life
on
any
shore
we
passed
she
waved
a
tiny
handkerchief
diligently
she
did
this
and
with
grave
face
never
visible
to
the
objects
of
her
devotion
i
suppose
but
certainly
very
happy
the
most
persistent
lover
of
humanity
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
afternoon
we
were
beyond
sight
of
land
the
world
grew
a
little
chilly
and
over
the
opaque
hueless
water
came
sliding
a
queer
pale
mist
we
strained
through
it
for
hours
a
low
bank
of
cloud
not
twenty
feet
in
height
on
which
one
could
look
down
from
the
higher
deck
its
upper
surface
was
quite
flat
and
smooth
save
for
innumerable
tiny
molehills
or
pyramids
of
mist
we
seemed
to
be
ploughing
aimlessly
through
the
phantasmal
of
another
world
faintly
and
by
an
accident
apprehended
so
may
the
shades
on
a
ghostly
liner
plunging
down
lethe
have
an
hour
chance
glimpse
of
the
lights
and
lives
of
piccadilly
to
them
uncertain
and
filmy
mirages
of
the
air
to
taste
the
full
deliciousness
of
travelling
in
an
american
train
by
night
through
new
scenery
you
must
carefully
secure
a
lower
berth
and
when
you
are
secret
and
separate
in
your
little
oblong
world
safe
between
sheets
pull
up
the
blinds
on
the
great
window
a
few
inches
and
leave
them
so
thus
as
you
lie
you
can
view
the
dark
procession
of
woods
and
hills
and
mingle
the
broken
hours
of
railway
slumber
with
glimpses
of
a
wild
starlit
landscape
the
country
retains
individuality
and
yet
puts
on
romance
especially
the
rough
shaggy
region
between
port
arthur
and
winnipeg
for
four
hundred
miles
there
is
hardly
a
sign
that
humanity
exists
on
the
earth
face
only
rocks
and
endless
woods
of
scrubby
pine
and
the
occasional
strange
gleam
of
water
and
night
and
the
wind
dream
and
reality
mingle
you
may
wake
from
sleep
to
find
yourself
flying
through
a
region
where
a
forest
fire
has
passed
a
place
of
grey
stripped
of
foliage
occasionally
waving
a
naked
bough
they
appear
stricken
by
calamity
intolerably
bare
and
lonely
gaunt
perpetually
protesting
amazed
and
tragic
creatures
we
saw
no
actual
fire
the
night
i
passed
but
a
little
while
after
dawn
we
noticed
on
the
horizon
fifteen
miles
away
an
immense
column
of
smoke
there
was
little
wind
and
it
hung
as
if
sculptured
against
the
grey
of
the
morning
nor
did
we
lose
sight
of
it
till
just
before
we
boomed
over
a
wide
swift
muddy
river
into
the
flat
city
of
winnipeg
winnipeg
is
the
west
it
is
important
and
obvious
that
in
canada
there
are
two
or
three
some
say
five
distinct
canadas
even
if
you
lump
the
french
and
english
together
as
one
community
in
the
east
there
remains
the
gulf
of
the
great
lakes
the
difference
between
east
and
west
is
possibly
no
greater
than
that
between
north
and
south
england
or
bavaria
and
prussia
but
in
this
country
yet
unconscious
of
itself
there
is
so
much
less
to
hold
them
together
the
character
of
the
land
and
the
people
differs
their
interests
as
it
appears
to
them
are
not
the
same
winnipeg
is
a
new
city
in
the
archives
at
ottawa
is
a
picture
of
winnipeg
in
main
street
with
a
few
shacks
and
the
prairie
either
end
now
her
population
is
a
hundred
thousand
and
she
has
the
biggest
this
that
and
the
other
west
of
toronto
a
new
city
a
little
more
american
than
the
other
canadian
cities
but
not
unpleasantly
so
the
streets
are
wider
and
full
of
a
bustle
which
keeps
clear
of
hustle
the
people
have
something
of
the
free
swing
of
americans
without
the
bumptiousness
a
tempered
democracy
a
mitigated
independence
of
bearing
the
manners
of
winnipeg
of
the
west
impress
the
stranger
as
better
than
those
of
the
east
more
friendly
more
hearty
more
certain
to
achieve
graciousness
if
not
grace
there
is
even
in
the
architecture
of
winnipeg
a
sort
of
pride
visible
it
is
hideous
of
course
even
more
hideous
than
toronto
or
montreal
but
cheerily
and
windily
so
there
is
no
scheme
in
the
city
and
no
beauty
but
it
is
at
least
preferable
to
birmingham
less
dingy
less
directly
depressing
it
has
no
real
slums
even
though
there
is
poverty
and
destitution
but
there
seems
to
be
a
trifle
more
public
spirit
in
the
west
than
the
east
perhaps
it
is
that
in
the
greater
eagerness
and
confidence
of
this
newer
country
men
have
a
superfluity
of
energy
and
interest
even
after
attending
to
their
own
affairs
to
give
to
the
community
perhaps
it
is
that
the
west
is
so
young
that
one
has
a
suspicion
has
still
some
element
of
a
child
game
in
it
its
only
excuse
at
any
rate
whether
because
the
state
of
affairs
is
yet
unsettled
or
because
of
the
invisible
subtle
spirit
of
optimism
that
blows
through
the
heavily
clustering
and
past
the
neat
little
modern
villas
and
down
the
solidly
pretentious
streets
one
ca
help
finding
a
tiny
hope
that
winnipeg
the
city
of
buildings
and
the
city
of
human
beings
may
yet
come
to
something
it
is
a
slender
hope
not
to
be
compared
to
that
of
the
true
winnipeg
man
who
gazing
on
his
city
is
fired
with
the
proud
and
secret
ambition
that
it
will
soon
be
twice
as
big
and
after
that
four
times
and
then
ten
times
wider
still
and
wider
shall
thy
bounds
be
set
says
that
hymn
which
is
the
noblest
expression
of
modern
ambition
hope
is
sure
to
be
fulfilled
but
the
other
timid
prayer
that
something
different
something
more
worth
having
may
come
out
of
winnipeg
exists
and
not
quite
unreasonably
that
can
not
be
said
of
toronto
winnipeg
is
of
the
west
new
vigorous
in
its
way
of
unknown
potentialities
already
the
west
has
been
a
nuisance
to
the
east
in
the
fight
of
over
reciprocity
with
the
united
states
when
she
gets
a
larger
representation
in
parliament
she
will
be
still
more
of
a
nuisance
a
casual
traveller
can
not
venture
to
investigate
the
beliefs
and
opinions
of
the
inhabitants
of
a
country
but
he
can
record
them
all
the
better
perhaps
for
his
it
is
generally
believed
in
the
west
that
the
east
runs
canada
and
runs
it
for
its
own
advantage
and
the
east
means
a
very
few
rich
men
who
control
the
big
railways
the
banks
and
the
manufacturers
association
subscribe
to
both
political
parties
and
are
generally
credited
with
complete
control
over
the
tariff
and
most
other
canadian
affairs
whether
or
no
the
manufacturers
association
does
arrange
the
tariff
and
control
the
commerce
of
canada
it
is
generally
believed
to
do
so
the
only
thing
is
that
its
friends
say
that
it
acts
in
the
best
interests
of
canada
its
enemies
that
it
acts
in
the
best
interests
of
the
association
among
its
enemies
are
many
in
the
west
the
normal
western
life
is
a
lonely
and
individual
one
and
a
large
part
of
the
population
has
crossed
from
the
united
states
or
belongs
to
that
great
mass
of
european
immigration
that
canada
is
letting
so
blindly
in
so
naturally
the
westerner
does
not
feel
the
same
affection
for
the
empire
or
for
england
as
the
british
canadians
of
the
east
whose
forefathers
fought
to
stay
within
the
empire
nor
is
his
affection
increased
by
the
suspicion
that
the
imperial
cry
has
been
used
for
party
purposes
he
has
no
use
for
politics
at
ottawa
the
naval
question
is
nothing
to
him
he
wants
neither
to
subscribe
money
nor
to
build
ships
europe
is
very
far
away
and
he
is
too
ignorant
to
realise
his
close
connection
with
her
he
has
strong
views
however
on
a
tariff
which
only
affects
him
by
perpetually
raising
the
cost
of
living
and
farming
the
ideas
of
even
a
conservative
in
the
west
about
reducing
the
tariff
would
make
an
eastern
die
of
and
the
westerner
also
hates
the
banks
the
banking
system
of
canada
is
peculiar
and
throws
the
control
of
the
banks
into
the
hands
of
a
few
people
in
the
east
who
were
felt
by
the
ever
optimistic
west
to
have
shut
down
credit
too
completely
during
the
recent
money
stringency
the
most
interesting
expression
of
the
new
western
point
of
view
and
in
many
ways
the
most
hopeful
movement
in
canada
is
the
movement
among
the
of
the
three
prairie
provinces
only
started
a
few
years
ago
it
has
grown
rapidly
in
numbers
wealth
power
and
extent
of
operations
so
far
it
has
confined
itself
politically
to
influencing
provincial
legislatures
but
it
has
gradually
attached
itself
to
an
advanced
radical
programme
of
a
chartist
description
and
it
is
becoming
powerful
whether
the
outcome
will
be
a
very
desirable
rejuvenation
of
the
liberal
party
or
the
creation
of
a
third
perhaps
party
it
is
hard
to
tell
at
any
rate
the
change
will
come
and
just
to
start
with
there
will
very
shortly
come
to
the
eastern
powers
who
threw
out
reciprocity
with
the
states
for
the
sake
of
the
empire
a
demand
from
the
west
that
the
preference
to
british
goods
be
increased
rapidly
till
they
be
allowed
to
come
in
free
also
for
the
empire
sake
then
the
fun
will
begin
x
outside
i
had
visited
new
york
boston
quebec
montreal
and
toronto
in
winnipeg
i
found
a
friend
who
was
tired
of
cities
so
was
i
in
canada
the
remedy
lies
close
at
hand
we
took
ancient
clothes
and
i
ben
jonson
and
jane
austen
to
keep
me
english
and
departed
northward
for
a
lodge
reported
to
exist
in
a
region
of
lakes
and
hills
and
forests
and
caribou
and
indians
and
a
few
people
at
first
the
train
sauntered
through
a
smiling
plain
intermittently
cultivated
and
dotted
with
little
new
villages
over
this
country
are
thrown
little
pools
of
that
flood
of
european
immigration
that
pours
through
winnipeg
to
remain
separate
or
be
absorbed
as
destiny
wills
the
problem
of
immigration
here
reveals
that
purposelessness
that
exists
in
the
affairs
of
canada
even
more
than
those
of
other
nations
the
multitude
from
south
or
east
europe
flocks
in
some
make
money
and
return
the
most
remain
often
in
inassimilable
lumps
there
is
every
sign
that
these
lumps
may
poison
the
health
of
canada
as
dangerously
as
they
have
that
of
the
united
states
for
canada
there
is
the
peril
of
too
large
an
element
of
foreign
blood
and
traditions
in
a
small
nation
already
little
more
than
half
composed
of
british
blood
and
descent
nationalities
seem
to
teach
one
another
only
their
worst
if
the
italians
gave
the
canadians
of
their
good
manners
and
the
doukhobors
or
poles
inoculated
them
with
idealism
and
the
love
of
beauty
and
received
from
them
british
romanticism
and
sense
of
responsibility
but
they
only
seem
to
increase
the
anarchy
these
and
to
learn
the
american
twang
and
method
of
spitting
and
there
is
the
peril
of
politics
upon
these
scattered
exotic
communities
ignorant
of
the
problems
of
their
adopted
land
ignorant
even
of
its
language
swoop
the
agents
of
political
parties
with
their
one
effectual
argument
bad

this
baptism
is
the
immigrants
only
organised
welcome
into
their
new
liberties
occasionally
some
church
raises
a
thin
protest
but
the
continues
to
take
up
his
burden
and
the
floods
from
europe
pour
in
canadians
regard
this
influx
with
that
queer
fatalism
which
men
adopt
under
plutocracy
how
could
they
stop
it
it
pays
the
steamship
and
railway
companies
it
may
or
may
not
be
good
for
canada
who
knows
in
any
case
it
will
go
on
our
masters
wish
it
it
is
noteworthy
that
icelanders
are
found
to
be
far
the
readiest
to
mingle
and
become
canadian
after
them
norwegians
and
swedes
with
other
immigrant
nationalities
hope
lies
with
the
younger
generation
but
these
acclimatise
immediately
our
train
was
boarded
by
a
crowd
of
ruthenians
or
galicians
and
beautiful
people
not
yet
wholly
civilised
out
of
their
own
costume
the
girls
chatted
together
in
a
swift
lovely
language
and
the
children
danced
about
tossing
their
queer
brown
mops
of
hair
they
clattered
out
at
a
little
village
that
seemed
to
belong
to
them
and
stood
waving
and
laughing
us
out
of
sight
i
pondered
on
their
feelings
and
looked
for
the
name
of
the
little
utopia
these
aliens
had
found
in
a
new
world
it
was
called
for
the
railway
companies
name
towns
in
this
country
we
wandered
into
rougher
country
where
the
rocks
begin
to
show
through
the
surface
and
scrub
pine
abounds
at
the
end
of
our
was

and
at
the
end
of
that
a
village
the
ultimate
outpost
of
civilisation
here
on
the
way
back
some
weeks
later
we
had
to
spend
the
night
in
a
little
hotel
which
transients
it
was
a
rough
affair
of
planks
inhabited
by
whatever
wandering
workman
from
or
other
labour
in
the
region
wanted
shelter
for
the
night
you
slept
in
a
sort
of
dormitory
each
bed
partitioned
off
from
the
rest
by
walls
that
were
some
feet
short
of
the
ceiling
swedes
germans
welsh
italians
and
poles
occupied
the
other
partitions
each
blaspheming
the
works
of
the
lord
in
his
own
tongue
about
midnight
two
pairs
of
feet
crashed
into
the
cell
opposite
mine
and
a
high
sleepless
voice
with
an
accent
i
knew
continued
an
interminable
argument
on
theology
i
beginning
wash
word
it
proclaimed
with
all
the
melancholy
of
drunkenness
the
other
disputant
was
german
or
norwegian
and
uninterested
though
very
kindly
he
said
let
go
sleep

pondered
the
englishman
the
norwegian
suggested
several
sleepily
logos
wailed
the
other
logos
and
wept
they
persisted
hour
by
hour
disconnected
voices
in
the
void
and
darkness
lonely
and
chance
companions
in
the
of
canada
the
one
who
could
and
the
one
who
did
want
to
understand
a
little
before
dawn
i
woke
again
that
thin
voice
in
patient
soliloquy
was
discussing
female
suffrage
going
very
far
down
into
the
roots
of
the
matter
i
met
its
owner
next
morning
he
was
tall
and
dark
and
lachrymose
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
breath
that
stank
of
gin
he
had
played
for
college
in
and
had
prepared
for
ordination
understand
old
man
he
said
how
out
of
place
i
am
amongst
this
scum
hoi
polloi
we
not
of
the
hoi
polloi
are
we
it
seemed
nicer
to
agree
oh
i
know
greek
he
was
too
eagerly
the
gentleman
ho
cosmos
tes
adikias
the
last
thing
i
learnt
for
ordination
this
world
of
injustice
that
right
is
it
he
laughed
sickly
i
say
as
one
man
to
another
we
not
hoi
polloi
could
you
lend
me
some
money
we
had
to
press
on
thirty
miles
up
a
railway
to
a
a
settlement
by
a
waterfall
in
the
wild
an
engine
and
an
ancient
conveyed
us
the
van
held
us
three
crates
and
some
sacks
four
in
black
slouch
hats
who
curled
up
on
the
floor
like
dogs
and
slept
and
an
aged
italian
this
last
knew
no
word
of
english
he
had
travelled
all
the
way
from
naples
heaven
knows
how
to
find
his
two
sons
supposed
to
be
working
in
the
so
much
was
written
on
a
piece
of
paper
we
gave
him
chocolate
and
at
intervals
i
repeated
to
him
my
only
italian
the
first
line
of
the
he
seemed
cheered
the
van
jolted
on
through
the
fading
light
once
a
man
stepped
out
on
to
the
track
stopped
us
and
clambered
silently
up
we
went
on
it
was
the
doctor
who
had
been
visiting
some
lonely
hut
in
the
woods
later
another
figure
was
seen
staggering
between
the
rails
we
slowed
up
shouted
and
finally
stopped
butting
him
gently
on
the
back
with
our
buffers
and
causing
him
to
fall
he
was
very
drunk
the
driver
and
the
doctor
helped
him
into
the
van
there
he
stood
and
looking
round
said
very
distinctly
i
do
not
wish
to
travel
on
your
train
so
we
put
him
off
again
and
proceeded
such
is
the
west
we
rattled
interminably
through
the
darkness
the
unpeopled
woods
closed
about
us
snatched
with
lean
branches
and
opened
out
again
to
a
windy
space
once
or
twice
the
ground
fell
away
and
there
was
for
a
moment
the
mysterious
gleam
and
stir
of
water
canadian
stars
are
remote
and
virginal
everyone
slumbered
arrival
at
the
great
concrete
building
and
the
little
shacks
of
the
shook
us
to
our
feet
the
italian
vanished
into
the
darkness
whether
he
found
his
sons
or
fell
into
the
river
no
one
knew
and
no
one
seemed
to
care
an
indian
taciturn
and
mongolian
led
us
on
next
day
by
boat
and
on
foot
to
the
lonely
we
aimed
at
it
stood
on
high
rocks
above
a
lake
six
miles
by
two
there
was
an
indian
somewhere
by
a
river
three
miles
west
and
a
trapper
to
the
east
and
a
family
encamped
on
an
island
in
the
lake
else
nobody
it
is
that
feeling
of
fresh
loneliness
that
impresses
itself
before
any
detail
of
the
wild
the
soul
or
the
personality
seems
to
have
indefinite
room
to
expand
there
is
no
one
else
within
reach
there
never
has
been
anyone
no
one
else
is
of
the
lakes
and
hills
you
see
before
you
they
have
no
tradition
no
names
even
they
are
only
pools
of
water
and
lumps
of
earth
some
day
perhaps
to
be
clothed
with
loves
and
memories
and
the
comings
and
goings
of
men
but
now
dumbly
waiting
their
wordsworth
or
their
acropolis
to
give
them
individuality
and
a
soul
in
such
country
as
this
there
is
a
rarefied
clean
sweetness
the
air
is
unbreathed
and
the
earth
untrodden
all
things
share
this
childlike
loveliness
the
grey
whispering
reeds
the
pure
blue
of
the
sky
the
birches
and
thin
that
make
up
these
forests
even
the
brisk
touch
of
the
clear
water
as
you
dive
that
last
sensation
indeed
and
none
of
sight
or
hearing
has
impressed
itself
as
the
token
of
canada
the
land
every
swimmer
knows
it
it
is
not
languorous
like
bathing
in
a
warm
southern
sea
nor
grateful
like
a
river
in
a
hot
climate
nor
strange
as
the
ocean
always
is
nor
startling
like
very
cold
water
but
it
touches
the
body
continually
with
freshness
and
it
seems
to
be
charged
with
a
subtle
and
unexhausted
energy
it
is
colourless
faintly
stinging
hard
and
grey
like
the
rocks
around
full
of
vitality
and
sweet
it
has
the
tint
and
sensation
of
a
pale
dawn
before
the
sun
is
up
such
is
the
wild
of
canada
it
awaits
the
sun
the
end
for
which
heaven
made
it
the
blessing
of
civilisation
some
day
it
will
be
sold
in
large
portions
and
the
timber
given
to
a
friend
of
and
cut
down
and
made
into
paper
on
which
shall
be
printed
the
praise
of
prosperity
and
the
land
itself
shall
be
divided
into
and
sold
and
and
sold
again
and
boomed
and
resold
and
boosted
and
distributed
to
fishy
young
men
who
will
vend
it
in
distant
parts
of
the
country
and
then
such
portions
as
can
never
be
built
upon
shall
be
given
in
exchange
for
great
sums
of
money
to
old
ladies
in
the
quieter
parts
of
england
but
the
central
parts
of
towns
shall
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
wise
and
on
these
shall
churches
hotels
and
a
great
many
ugly
skyscrapers
be
built
and
hovels
for
the
poor
and
houses
for
the
rich
none
beautiful
and
there
shall
ugly
objects
be
manufactured
rather
hurriedly
and
sold
to
the
people
at
more
than
they
are
worth
because
similar
and
cheaper
objects
made
in
other
countries
are
kept
out
by
a
tariff
but
at
present
there
are
only
the
wrinkled
lake
sliding
ever
sideways
and
the
grey
rocks
and
the
cliffs
and
hills
covered
with
and
the
fresh
wind
among
the
birches
and
quiet
and
that
unseizable
virginity
dawn
is
always
a
lost
pearly
glow
in
the
ashen
skies
and
sunset
a
multitude
of
mists
sliding
before
a
remotely
golden
west
they
follow
one
another
with
an
infinite
loneliness
and
there
is
a
far
and
solitary
beach
of
dark
golden
sand
close
by
a
deserted
indian
camp
where
if
you
drift
quietly
round
the
corner
in
a
canoe
you
may
see
a
bear
stumbling
along
or
a
great
caribou
or
a
little
red
deer
coming
down
to
the
water
to
drink
treading
the
wild
edge
of
lake
and
forest
with
a
light
secret
and
melancholy
grace
xi
the
prairies
i
passed
the
last
few
hours
of
the
westward
journey
from
winnipeg
to
regina
in
daylight
the
daylight
of
a
wet
and
cheerless
sunday
the
car
was
in
possession
of
a
family
of
small
children
and
some
theatrical
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
the
united
states
travelling
on
night
stands
who
were
collectively
called
barbary
pirates
we
jogged
limply
from
little
village
to
little
village
each
composed
of
little
brown
with
a
few
buildings
of
tin
and
corrugated
iron
and
even
of
brick
and
several
each
village
i
beg
your
pardon
seems
to
be
exactly
like
the
next
they
differ
a
little
in
size
from
populations
of
to
nearly
and
in
age
for
some
have
buildings
dating
almost
back
to
the
nineteenth
century
and
a
few
are
still
mostly
tents
they
seemed
all
to
be
emptied
of
their
folk
this
sabbath
morn
though
whether
the
inhabitants
were
at
work
or
in
church
or
had
shot
themselves
from
depression
induced
by
the
weather
it
was
impossible
to
tell
these
little
towns
do
not
look
to
the
comfortable
as
homes
partly
there
is
the
difficulty
of
distinguishing
your
village
from
the
others
it
would
be
as
bad
as
being
married
to
a
jap
and
then
towns
should
be
on
hills
or
in
valleys
however
small
a
town
dumped
down
apparently
by
chance
on
a
flat
expanse
wears
the
same
air
of
discomfort
as
a
man
trying
to
make
his
bed
on
a
level
unyielding
surface
such
as
a
lawn
or
pavement
he
feels
hopelessly
incidental
to
the
superficies
of
the
earth
he
is
aware
that
the
human
race
has
yet
this
country
is
not
quite
flat
as
i
had
been
led
to
expect
it
does
not
give
you
that
feeling
of
a
plain
you
have
in
parts
of
lombardy
and
holland
and
belgium
this
may
have
been
due
to
the
grey
mist
and
drizzle
which
curtained
off
the
horizon
but
the
land
was
always
very
slightly
rolling
and
sometimes
almost
as
uneven
as
a
surrey
common
at
first
it
seemed
to
be
given
to
mixed
farming
a
good
deal
afterwards
to
wheat
oats
and
barley
but
a
great
part
is
uncultivated
grass
with
sparse
bushes
and
patches
of
brushwood
and
a
few
rare
trees
and
continual
clumps
of
large
golden
daisies
occasional
rough
black
roads
wind
through
the
brush
and
into
the
towns
and
die
into
grass
tracks
along
the
wire
fences
the
day
i
went
through
the
interminable
oblique
thin
rain
took
the
gold
out
of
the
wheat
and
the
brown
from
the
distant
fields
and
bushes
and
drabbed
all
the
colours
in
the
grass
the
children
in
the
car
cried
to
each
other
with
the
shrill
sick
persistency
of
tired
childhood
how
many
inches
to
regina
a
billion
a
trillion
a
shillion
the
barbary
pirates
laughed
incessantly
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
prairie
would
be
a
lonely
place
to
live
in
especially
if
it
rained
but
the
people
who
have
lived
there
for
years
tell
me
they
get
very
homesick
if
they
go
away
for
a
time
valleys
and
hills
seem
to
them
petty
fretful
unlovable
the
magic
of
the
plains
has
them
in
thrall
certainly
there
is
a
little
more
democracy
in
the
west
of
canada
than
the
east
the
communities
seem
a
little
less
incapable
of
looking
after
themselves
out
in
the
west
they
are
erecting
not
despicable
public
buildings
founding
universities
running
a
few
public
services
that
has
a
voice
in
these
undertakings
does
not
make
them
valueless
there
are
perceptible
in
the
prairies
among
all
the
corruption
irresponsibility
and
disastrous
individualism
some
faint
signs
of
the
sense
of
the
community
take
a
very
good
test
the
public
libraries
as
you
traverse
canada
from
east
to
west
they
steadily
improve
you
begin
in
the
city
of
montreal
which
is
unable
to
support
one
and
pass
through
the
dingy
rooms
and
inadequate
intellectual
provision
of
toronto
and
winnipeg
after
that
the
libraries
and
small
for
the
smaller
cities
are
cleaner
and
better
kept
show
signs
of
care
and
intelligence
until
at
last
in
calgary
you
find
a
very
neat
and
carefully
kept
building
stocked
with
an
immense
variety
of
periodicals
and
an
admirably
chosen
store
of
books
ranging
from
the
classics
to
the
most
utterly
modern
literature
few
large
english
towns
could
show
anything
as
good
cross
the
rockies
to
vancouver
and
you
back
among
dirty
walls
grubby
furniture
and
inadequate
literature
again
there
nothing
in
canada
to
compare
with
the
magnificent
libraries
little
new
zealand
can
show
but
calgary
is
hopeful
these
cities
grow
in
population
with
unimaginable
velocity
from
thirty
to
thirty
thousand
in
fifteen
years
is
the
usual
rate
pavements
are
laid
down
stores
and
bigger
stores
and
still
bigger
stores
spring
up
trams
buzz
along
the
streets
towards
the
unregarded
horizon
that
lies
across
the
end
of
most
roads
in
these
flat
geometrically
planned
probably
a
chinese
quarter
appears
and
the
beginnings
of
slums
expensive
and
pleasant
small
fringe
the
outskirts
and
rents
being
so
high
great
edifices
of
residential
flats
rival
the
great
stores
in
other
streets
or
even
sandwiched
between
the
finer
buildings
are
dingy
and
decaying
saloons
and
innumerable
little
booths
and
hovels
where
adventurers
deal
dishonestly
in
real
estate
and
employment
bureaux
and
there
are
the
vast
erections
of
the
great
corporations
hudson
bay
company
and
the
banks
and
the
railways
and
sometimes
almost
equally
impressive
the
public
buildings
there
are
the
beginnings
of
very
costly
universities
and
regina
has
built
a
superb
great
house
of
parliament
with
a
wide
sheet
of
water
in
front
of
it
a
noble
building
the
inhabitants
of
these
cities
are
proud
of
them
and
envious
of
each
other
with
a
bitter
rivalry
they
do
not
love
their
cities
as
a
manchester
man
loves
manchester
or
a
münchener
munich
for
they
have
probably
lately
arrived
in
them
and
will
surely
pass
on
soon
but
while
they
are
there
they
love
them
and
with
no
silent
love
they
boost
to
boost
is
to
commend
outrageously
and
each
cries
up
his
own
city
both
from
pride
it
would
appear
and
for
profit
for
the
fortunes
of
newville
are
very
really
the
fortunes
of
its
inhabitants
from
the
successful
speculator
owner
of
whole
blocks
to
the
waiter
bringing
you
a
martini
who
has
paid
up
a
fraction
of
the
cost
of
a
in
a
all
are
the
richer
as
well
as
the
prouder
if
newville
grows
it
is
imperative
to
praise
edmonton
in
edmonton
but
it
is
sudden
death
to
praise
it
in
calgary
the
partisans
of
each
city
proclaim
its
superiority
to
all
the
others
in
swiftness
of
growth
future
population
size
of
buildings
price
of
land
by
all
recognised
standards
of
excellence
i
travelled
from
edmonton
to
calgary
in
the
company
of
a
citizen
of
edmonton
and
a
citizen
of
calgary
hour
after
hour
they
disputed
land
in
calgary
had
risen
from
five
dollars
to
three
hundred
but
in
edmonton
from
three
to
five
hundred
edmonton
had
grown
from
thirty
persons
to
forty
thousand
in
twenty
years
but
calgary
from
twenty
to
thirty
thousand
in
twelve
where
as
a
respite
did
i
come
from
i
had
to
tell
them
not
without
shame
that
my
own
town
of
grantchester
having
numbered
three
hundred
at
the
time
of
julius
caesar
landing
had
risen
rapidly
to
nearly
four
by
doomsday
book
but
was
now
declined
to
they
seemed
perplexed
and
angry
sentimental
people
in
the
east
will
talk
of
the
romance
of
the
west
and
of
these
simple
brave
pioneers
who
have
wrung
a
living
from
the
soil
and
are
properly
proud
of
the
rude
little
towns
that
mark
their
conquest
over
nature
that
may
apply
to
the
frontiers
of
civilisation
up
north
but
the
have
progressed
beyond
all
that
a
few
of
the
old
pioneers
of
the
west
survive
to
watch
with
startled
eyes
the
wonderful
fruits
of
the
seed
they
sowed
such
are
among
the
finest
people
in
canada
very
different
from
the
younger
generation
with
wider
interests
good
talkers
the
best
of
company
from
them
and
from
records
one
can
learn
of
the
early
settlers
and
the
beginnings
of
the
mounted
police
the
police
seem
to
have
been
superb
for
no
great
reward
but
the
love
of
the
thing
they
imposed
order
and
fairness
upon
half
a
continent
the
indians
trusted
them
utterly
they
were
without
fear
a
store
stands
now
in
calgary
where
forty
years
ago
a
policeman
was
shot
to
death
by
a
murderer
followed
over
a
thousand
miles
he
knew
that
the
criminal
would
shoot
but
it
was
the
rule
of
the
mounted
police
not
to
fire
first
wounded
he
killed
his
man
then
died
and
there
was
the
case
of
the
desperado
who
crossed
the
border
and
was
eventually
captured
and
held
by
an
immense
force
of
american
police
and
military
they
awaited
a
regiment
of
the
police
to
conduct
the
villain
back
to
trial
two
appeared
and
being
asked
where
is
the
escort
replied
we
are
the
escort
and
started
back
their
five
hundred
miles
ride
with
the
murderer
in
tow
and
there
were
the
two
who
pursued
a
from
dawson
down
to
minneapolis
caught
him
and
took
him
back
to
dawson
to
be
hanged
and
there
was
the
settler
who
the
tragedy
of
the
west
is
that
these
men
have
passed
and
that
what
they
lived
and
died
to
secure
for
their
race
is
now
the
foundation
for
a
gigantic
national
gambling
of
a
most
unprofitable
and
disastrous
kind
hordes
of
people
who
mostly
seem
to
come
from
the
great
neighbouring
commonwealth
and
are
inspired
with
the
national
hunger
for
getting
rich
quickly
without
deserving
it
prey
on
the
community
by
their
dealings
in
what
is
humorously
called
estate
for
them
our
fathers
died
what
a
sowing
and
what
a
harvest
and
where
good
men
worked
or
perished
is
now
a
row
of
little
shops
all
devoted
to
the
sale
of
in
some
distant
spot
that
must
infallibly
become
a
great
city
in
the
next
two
years
and
in
the
doorway
of
each
lounges
a
youth
with
a
flabby
face
shifty
eyes
and
an
inhuman
mouth
who
invites
you
continually
with
the
most
raucous
of
american
accents
to
step
inside

our
praposition
xii
the
indians
when
i
was
in
the
east
i
got
to
know
a
man
who
had
spent
many
years
of
his
life
living
among
the
indians
he
showed
me
his
photographs
he
explained
one
of
an
old
woman
he
said
they
told
me
there
was
an
old
woman
in
the
camp
called
laughing
earth
when
i
heard
the
name
i
just
said
me
to
her
she
would
be
photographed
she
kept
turning
her
back
to
me
i
just
picked
up
a
clod
and
plugged
it
at
her
and
said
round
laughing
earth
she
turned
half
round
and
grinned
she
a
game
old
bird
i
joshed
all
the
boys
here
laughing
earth
was
my
girl
till
they
saw
her
photo
there
stands
laughing
earth
in
petticoat
and
blouse
her
grey
hair
blowing
about
her
her
back
is
towards
you
but
her
face
is
turned
and
scarcely
hidden
by
a
hand
that
is
raised
with
all
the
coyness
of
seventy
years
laughter
shines
from
the
infinitely
lined
round
brown
cheeks
and
from
the
mouth
and
from
the
dancing
eyes
and
floods
and
spills
over
from
each
of
the
innumerable
wrinkles
laughing
earth
there
is
endless
vitality
in
that
laughter
the
hand
and
face
and
the
old
body
laugh
no
skinny
intellectual
mirth
affecting
but
the
lips
it
was
the
merriment
of
an
apple
bobbing
on
the
bough
or
a
brown
stream
running
over
rocks
or
any
other
gay
creature
of
earth
and
with
all
was
a
great
dignity
invulnerable
to
clods
and
a
kindly
and
noble
beauty
by
the
light
of
that
laughter
much
becomes
clear
the
right
place
of
man
upon
earth
the
entire
suitability
in
life
of
very
petticoats
and
the
fact
that
old
age
is
only
a
different
kind
of
a
merriment
from
youth
and
a
wiser
and
by
that
light
the
fragments
of
this
pathetic
race
become
more
comprehensible
and
perhaps
less
pathetic
the
wanderer
in
canada
sees
them
from
time
to
time
the
more
the
further
west
he
goes
irrelevant
and
inscrutable
figures
in
the
east
french
and
scotch
frequent
the
borders
of
civilisation
in
any
western
town
you
may
chance
on
a
brave
and
his
wife
and
a
baby
resplendent
in
gay
blankets
and
trappings
sliding
gravely
through
the
hideousness
of
the
new
order
that
has
supplanted
them
and
there
will
be
a
few
loitering
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
these
people
of
mixed
race
generally
seem
unfortunate
in
the
first
generation
a
few
of
the
older
ones
the
have
good
and
hold
positions
in
the
society
for
which
they
pioneered
but
most
appear
to
inherit
the
weaknesses
of
both
sides
drink
does
its
work
and
the
nobler
ones
like
the
tragic
figure
of
that
poetess
who
died
recently
pauline
johnson
seem
fated
to
be
at
odds
with
the
world
the
happiest
whether
indian
or
are
those
who
live
beyond
the
edges
of
cultivation
and
order
and
force
a
livelihood
from
nature
by
hunting
and
fishing
go
anywhere
into
the
wild
and
you
will
find
in
little
clearings
by
lake
or
river
a
dilapidated
hut
with
a
family
of
these
solitaries
friendly
with
the
pioneers
or
trappers
around
ready
to
act
as
guide
on
hunt
or
trail
the
government
extraordinarily
painstaking
and
has
established
indian
schools
and
trains
some
of
them
to
take
their
places
in
the
civilisation
we
have
built
not
the
best
indians
these
say
lovers
of
the
race
i
have
met
them
as
clerks
or
stenographers
only
distinguishable
from
their
neighbours
by
a
darker
skin
and
a
sweeter
voice
and
manner
and
in
a
generation
or
two
i
suppose
the
strain
mingles
and
is
lost
so
we
finish
with
kindness
what
our
fathers
began
with
war
the
government
and
others
have
scientifically
studied
the
history
and
characteristics
of
the
indians
and
written
them
down
in
books
lest
it
be
forgotten
that
human
beings
could
be
so
extraordinary
they
were
a
wandering
race
it
appears
of
many
tribes
and
even
languages
not
apt
to
arts
or
crafts
they
had
and
have
an
unrefined
delight
in
bright
colours
they
enjoyed
a
believed
rather
dimly
in
a
presiding
power
and
very
definitely
in
certain
ethical
and
moral
rules
one
of
their
incomprehensible
customs
was
that
at
certain
intervals
the
tribe
divided
itself
into
two
factitious
divisions
each
headed
by
various
chiefs
and
gambled
furiously
for
many
days
one
party
against
the
other
they
were
pugnacious
and
in
their
uncivilised
way
fought
frequent
wars
they
were
remarkably
loyal
to
each
other
and
treacherous
to
the
foe
brave
and
very
stoical
monogamy
was
very
prevalent
it
is
remarked
that
husbands
and
wives
were
very
fond
of
each
other
and
the
great
body
of
scientific
opinion
favours
the
theory
that
mothers
were
much
attached
to
their
children
most
tribes
were
very
healthy
and
some
such
were
the
remarkable
people
who
hunted
fought
feasted
and
lived
here
until
the
light
came
and
all
was
changed
other
qualities
they
had
even
more
remarkable
to
a
european
such
as
utter
honesty
and
complete
devotion
to
the
truth
among
themselves
civilisation
disease
alcohol
and
vice
have
reduced
them
to
a
few
scattered
communities
and
some
stragglers
and
a
legend
the
admiration
of
boyhood
boys
they
were
pugnacious
hunters
loyal
and
cruel
older
than
the
merrier
children
of
the
south
seas
younger
and
simpler
than
the
weedy
furtive
acquisitive
youth
who
may
figure
our
age
and
type
we
must
be
a
morally
higher
race
than
the
indians
said
an
earnest
american
businessman
to
me
in
saskatoon
because
we
have
survived
them
the
great
darwin
has
proved
it
i
visited
later
a
community
of
our
moral
inferiors
an
indian
under
the
shade
of
the
rockies
the
government
has
put
aside
various
tracts
of
land
where
the
indians
may
conduct
their
lives
in
something
of
their
old
way
and
stationed
in
each
an
agent
to
protect
their
interests
for
every
white
man
as
an
agent
told
me
thinks
an
indian
legitimate
prey
for
all
forms
of
cheating
and
robbery
the
reservations
are
the
better
in
proportion
as
they
are
further
from
the
towns
and
cities
the
one
i
saw
was
peopled
by
a
few
hundred
stonies
one
of
the
finest
and
most
untouched
of
the
tribes
of
these
laughing
earth
had
made
one
but
alas
a
few
years
before
she
had
become
a
portion
of
the
mirthfulness
that
once
she
made
more
mirthful
the
indians
occupy
themselves
with
a
little
farming
and
hunting
and
with
expeditions
and
live
in
two
or
three
small
scattered
villages
of
huts
and
tents
but
the
centre
of
the
community
is
the
little
house
where
the
agent
has
his
office
here
we
sat
he
and
i
and
talked
behind
the
counter
the
agent
is
father
mother
clergyman
tutor
physician
solicitor
and
banker
to
the
indians
they
wandered
in
and
out
of
the
place
with
their
various
requests
the
most
part
of
them
could
not
talk
english
but
there
was
generally
some
young
indian
to
interpret
an
old
chief
entered
his
grey
hair
curled
down
to
his
broad
shoulders
he
had
a
noble
forehead
brown
steady
eyes
a
thin
humorous
mouth
his
cow
had
been
run
over
by
the
what
was
to
be
done
and
how
much
would
he
get
the
affair
was
discussed
through
an
interpreter
a
canadianised
young
indian
in
trousers
who
spat
some
of
the
men
especially
the
older
ones
have
wonderful
dignity
and
beauty
of
face
and
body
their
physique
is
superb
their
features
shaped
and
lined
by
weather
and
experience
into
a
roman
nobility
that
demands
respect
several
such
passed
through
then
came
an
old
woman
wizened
and
loquacious
bent
double
by
the
sack
of
her
weekly
provision
of
meat
and
flour
she
required
oil
was
given
it
secreted
it
in
some
cranny
of
the
bundle
that
she
was
and
staggered
creakily
off
again
the
office
emptied
for
a
while
then
drifted
in
a
younger
man
tall
with
that
brown
expression
of
simplicity
many
indians
wear
he
was
covered
by
a
large
blanket
over
his
other
clothes
he
puffed
at
a
pipe
and
stared
out
of
the
window
the
agent
and
i
continued
talking
you
must
never
hurry
an
indian
presently
he
gave
a
little
grunt
the
agent
said
well
john
john
went
on
smoking
five
minutes
later
in
the
middle
of
our
conversation
john
said
suddenly
salt
he
was
staring
inexpressively
at
the
ceiling
why
john
said
the
agent
i
gave
you
enough
salts
on
thursday
to
last
you
a
week
john
directed
his
gaze
on
us
and
smoked
dumbly
still
the
stomach
inquired
the
agent
genially
john
expression
became
gradually
grimmer
and
he
moved
one
hand
slowly
across
till
it
rested
on
his
stomach
an
impassive
significant
hand
after
a
courteous
pause
the
agent
rose
poured
some
epsom
salts
out
of
a
large
jar
wrapped
them
in
paper
and
handed
them
over
john
secreted
them
dispassionately
in
some
pouch
among
the
skins
and
blankets
that
wrapped
him
in
we
went
back
to
our
conversation
five
minutes
after
he
grunted
suddenly
again
five
minutes
and
he
departed
his
wife
a
plump
patient
young
woman
and
his
fat
ridiculous
son
of
four
were
sitting
stolidly
on
the
grass
outside
it
obviously
made
no
difference
if
he
took
one
hour
or
seven
over
his
business
they
mounted
their
tiny
ponies
and
trotted
briskly
off
i
suppose
one
is
apt
to
be
sentimental
about
these
good
people
they
really
so
picturesque
they
trail
clouds
of
fenimore
cooper
and
they
seem
for
all
their
unfitness
reposefully
more
in
touch
with
permanent
things
than
the
america
that
has
succeeded
them
and
it
is
interesting
to
watch
our
pathetic
efforts
to
prevent
or
disarm
the
effects
of
ourselves
what
will
happen
shall
we
preserve
these
few
bands
of
them
untouched
to
succeed
us
ultimately
when
the
grasp
of
our
weakens
and
our
transient
anarchy
in
these
wilder
lands
recedes
once
more
before
the
older
anarchy
of
nature
or
will
they
be
entirely
swallowed
by
that
ugliness
of
shops
and
trousers
with
which
we
enchain
the
earth
and
become
a
memory
and
less
than
a
memory
they
are
that
already
the
indians
have
passed
they
left
no
arts
no
tradition
no
buildings
or
roads
or
laws
only
a
story
or
two
and
a
few
names
strange
and
beautiful
the
ghosts
of
the
old
chiefs
must
surely
chuckle
when
they
note
that
the
name
by
which
canada
has
called
her
capital
and
the
centre
of
her
political
life
ottawa
is
an
indian
name
which
signifies
and
selling
and
the
wanderer
in
this
land
will
always
be
remarking
an
unexplained
fragrance
about
the
as
from
some
flower
which
has
withered
and
which
he
does
not
know
xiii
the
rockies
at
calgary
if
you
can
spare
a
minute
from
more
important
matters
slip
beyond
the
hurrying
white
city
climb
the
golf
links
and
gaze
west
a
low
bank
of
dark
clouds
disturbs
you
by
the
fixity
of
its
outline
it
is
the
rockies
seventy
miles
away
on
a
good
day
it
is
said
they
are
visible
twice
as
far
so
clear
and
serene
is
this
air
five
hundred
miles
west
is
the
coast
of
british
columbia
a
region
with
a
different
climate
different
country
and
different
problems
it
is
cut
off
from
the
prairies
by
vast
tracts
of
wild
country
and
uninhabitable
ranges
for
nearly
two
hundred
miles
the
train
pants
through
the
homeless
grandeur
of
the
rockies
and
the
selkirks
four
or
five
hotels
a
few
huts
or
tents
and
a
rare
that
is
all
the
habitation
in
many
thousands
of
square
miles
little
even
of
that
is
visible
from
the
train
that
is
one
of
the
chief
differences
between
the
effect
of
the
rockies
and
that
of
the
alps
there
you
are
always
in
sight
of
a
civilisation
which
has
nestled
for
ages
at
the
feet
of
those
high
places
they
stand
enrobed
with
worship
and
grander
by
contrast
with
the
lives
of
men
these
heights
are
inhuman
or
rather
irrelevant
to
humanity
no
recorded
hannibal
has
struggled
across
them
their
shadow
lies
on
no
remembered
literature
they
acknowledge
claims
neither
of
the
soul
nor
of
the
body
of
man
he
is
a
stranger
neither
nature
enemy
nor
her
child
she
is
there
alone
scarcely
a
unity
in
the
heaped
confusion
of
these
crags
almost
without
grandeur
among
the
chaos
of
earth
yet
this
horrid
and
solitary
wildness
is
but
one
aspect
there
is
beauty
here
at
length
for
the
first
time
in
canada
the
real
beauty
that
is
always
too
sudden
for
mortal
eyes
and
brings
pain
with
its
comfort
the
rockies
have
a
remoter
yet
a
kindlier
beauty
than
the
alps
their
rock
is
of
a
browner
colour
and
such
rugged
peaks
and
crowns
as
do
not
attain
snow
continually
suggest
gigantic
castellations
or
the
ramparts
of
titans
eastward
the
foothills
are
few
and
low
and
the
mountains
stand
superbly
the
heart
lifts
to
see
them
they
guard
the
sunset
into
this
rocky
wilderness
you
plunge
and
toil
through
it
hour
by
hour
viewing
it
from
the
rear
of
the
the
is
a
great
invention
of
the
new
world
at
the
end
of
the
train
is
a
compartment
with
large
windows
and
a
little
platform
behind
it
roofed
over
but
exposed
otherwise
to
the
air
on
this
platform
are
sixteen
little
perches
for
which
you
fight
with
americans
victorious
you
crouch
on
one
and
watch
the
panorama
behind
the
train
it
is
an
admirable
way
of
viewing
scenery
but
a
day
of
being
perpetually
drawn
backwards
at
a
great
pace
through
some
of
the
grandest
mountains
in
the
world
has
a
queer
effect
like
life
it
leaves
you
with
a
dizzy
irritation
for
as
in
life
you
never
see
the
glories
till
they
are
past
and
then
they
vanish
with
incredible
rapidity
and
if
you
crane
to
see
the
dwindling
further
peaks
you
miss
the
new
splendours
the
day
i
went
through
most
of
the
rockies
was
by
some
standards
a
bad
one
for
the
view
rain
scudded
by
in
forlorn
grey
showers
and
the
upper
parts
of
the
mountains
were
wrapped
in
cloud
which
was
but
rarely
blown
aside
to
reveal
the
heights
sublimity
therefore
was
left
to
the
imagination
but
desolation
was
most
vividly
present
in
no
weather
could
the
impression
of
loneliness
be
stronger
the
pines
drooped
and
sobbed
cascades
born
somewhere
in
the
dun
firmament
above
dropped
down
the
mountain
sides
in
white
threads
the
rivers
roared
and
plunged
with
aimless
passion
down
the
ravines
stray
little
clouds
left
behind
when
the
wrack
lifted
a
little
ran
bleating
up
and
down
the
forlorn
more
often
the
clouds
trailed
along
the
valleys
a
long
procession
of
shrouded
melancholy
figures
seeming
to
pause
as
with
an
indeterminate
tragic
vain
gesture
before
passing
out
of
sight
up
some
ravine
yet
desolation
is
not
the
final
impression
that
will
remain
of
the
rockies
and
the
selkirks
i
was
advised
by
various
people
to
at
banff
and
at
lake
louise
in
the
rockies
i
did
so
they
are
supposed
to
be
equally
the
of
the
mountains
how
perplexing
it
is
that
advisers
are
always
so
kindly
and
willing
to
help
and
always
so
undiscriminating
it
is
equally
disastrous
to
be
a
sceptic
and
to
be
credulous
banff
is
an
ordinary
little
in
mountainous
country
with
hills
and
a
stream
and
beyond
beautiful
enough
and
invigorating
but
lake
louise
lake
louise
is
of
another
world
imagine
a
little
round
lake
feet
up
a
mile
across
closed
in
by
great
cliffs
of
brown
rock
round
the
shoulders
of
which
are
thrown
mantles
of
close
dark
pine
at
one
end
the
lake
is
fed
by
a
vast
glacier
and
its
milky
tumbling
stream
and
the
glacier
climbs
to
snowfields
of
one
of
the
highest
and
loveliest
peaks
in
the
rockies
which
keeps
perpetual
guard
over
the
scene
to
this
place
you
go
up
three
or
four
miles
from
the
railway
there
is
the
hotel
at
one
end
of
the
lake
facing
the
glacier
else
no
sign
of
humanity
from
the
windows
you
may
watch
the
water
and
the
peaks
all
day
and
never
see
the
same
view
twice
in
the
lake
is
beauty
herself
as
nearly
visible
to
mortal
eyes
as
she
may
ever
be
the
water
beyond
the
flowers
is
green
always
a
different
green
sometimes
it
is
tranquil
glassy
shot
with
blue
of
a
peacock
tint
then
a
little
wind
awakes
in
the
distance
and
ruffles
the
surface
yard
by
yard
covering
it
with
a
myriad
tiny
wrinkles
till
half
the
lake
is
milky
emerald
while
the
rest
still
sleeps
and
at
length
the
whole
is
astir
and
the
sun
catches
it
and
lake
louise
is
a
web
of
laughter
the
opal
distillation
of
all
the
buds
of
all
the
spring
on
either
side
go
up
the
dark
processional
pines
mounting
to
the
sacred
peaks
devout
kneeling
motionless
in
an
ecstasy
of
homely
adoration
like
the
donors
and
their
families
in
a
flemish
picture
among
these
you
may
wander
for
hours
by
little
rambling
paths
over
white
and
red
and
golden
flowers
and
continually
you
spy
little
lakes
hidden
away
each
a
shy
soft
jewel
of
a
new
strange
tint
of
green
or
blue
mutable
and
lovely
and
beyond
all
is
the
glacier
and
the
vast
fields
and
peaks
of
eternal
snow
if
you
watch
the
great
white
cliff
from
the
foot
of
which
the
glacier
flows
seven
miles
away
but
it
seems
two
you
will
sometimes
see
a
little
puff
of
silvery
smoke
go
up
thin
and
vanish
a
few
seconds
later
comes
the
roar
of
terrific
distant
thunder
the
mountains
tower
and
smile
unregarding
in
the
sun
it
was
an
avalanche
and
if
you
climb
any
of
the
ridges
or
peaks
around
there
are
discovered
other
valleys
and
heights
and
ranges
wild
and
desert
stretching
endlessly
away
as
day
draws
to
an
end
the
shadows
on
the
snow
turn
bluer
the
crying
of
innumerable
waters
hushes
and
the
immense
bare
ramparts
of
rock
that
guard
the
great
valley
win
a
rich
radiance
long
after
the
sun
has
set
they
seem
to
give
forth
the
splendour
of
the
day
and
the
tranquillity
of
their
centuries
in
undiminished
fulness
they
have
that
serenity
which
a
perfect
old
age
possesses
and
as
with
a
perfect
old
age
so
here
the
colour
and
the
light
ebb
so
gradually
out
of
things
that
you
could
swear
nothing
of
the
radiance
and
glory
gone
up
to
the
very
moment
before
the
dark
it
was
on
such
a
height
and
at
some
such
hour
as
this
that
i
sat
and
considered
the
nature
of
the
country
in
this
continent
there
was
perceptible
even
here
though
less
urgent
than
elsewhere
the
strangeness
i
had
noticed
in
woods
by
the
st
lawrence
and
on
the
banks
of
the
delaware
where
are
girls
who
sing
at
dawn
and
in
british
columbia
and
afterwards
among
the
brown
hills
and
colossal
trees
of
california
but
especially
by
that
lonely
golden
beach
in
manitoba
where
the
little
brown
deer
run
down
to
drink
and
the
wild
geese
through
the
evening
go
flying
and
crying
it
is
an
empty
land
to
love
the
country
here
mountains
are
worshipped
not
loved
is
like
embracing
a
wraith
a
european
can
find
nothing
to
satisfy
the
hunger
of
his
heart
the
air
is
too
thin
to
breathe
he
requires
haunted
woods
and
the
friendly
presence
of
ghosts
the
immaterial
soil
of
england
is
heavy
and
fertile
with
the
decaying
stuff
of
past
seasons
and
generations
here
is
the
floor
of
a
new
wood
yet
uncumbered
by
one
year
autumn
fall
we
europeans
find
the
orient
stale
and
too
luxuriantly
fetid
by
reason
of
the
multitude
of
bygone
lives
and
thoughts
oppressive
with
the
crowded
presence
of
the
dead
both
men
and
gods
so
i
imagine
a
canadian
would
feel
our
woods
and
fields
heavy
with
the
past
and
the
invisible
and
suffer
claustrophobia
in
an
english
countryside
beneath
the
dreadful
pressure
of
immortals
for
his
own
forests
and
wild
places
are
windswept
and
empty
that
is
their
charm
and
their
terror
you
may
lie
awake
all
night
and
never
feel
the
passing
of
evil
presences
nor
hear
printless
feet
neither
do
you
lapse
into
slumber
with
the
comfortable
consciousness
of
those
friendly
watchers
who
sit
invisibly
by
a
lonely
sleeper
under
an
english
sky
even
an
irishman
would
not
see
a
row
of
little
men
with
green
caps
lepping
along
beneath
the
and
the
golden
daisies
nor
have
the
subtler
fairies
of
england
found
these
wilds
it
has
never
paid
a
steamship
or
railway
company
to
arrange
for
their
emigration
in
the
bush
of
certain
islands
of
the
south
seas
you
may
hear
a
crashing
on
windless
noons
and
looking
up
see
a
corpse
swinging
along
head
downwards
at
a
great
speed
from
tree
to
tree
holding
by
its
toes
grimacing
dripping
with
decay
americans
so
active
in
this
life
rest
quiet
afterwards
and
though
every
stone
of
wall
street
have
its
separate
lar
their
kind
have
not
gone
out
beyond
the
maple
and
the
birch
conceal
no
dryads
and
pan
has
never
been
heard
amongst
these
reedbeds
look
as
long
as
you
like
upon
a
cataract
of
the
new
world
you
shall
not
see
a
white
arm
in
the
foam
a
godless
place
and
the
dead
do
not
return
that
is
why
there
is
nothing
lurking
in
the
heart
of
the
shadows
and
no
human
mystery
in
the
colours
and
neither
the
same
joy
nor
the
kind
of
peace
in
dawn
and
sunset
that
older
lands
know
it
is
indeed
a
new
world
how
far
away
seem
those
grassy
moonlit
places
in
england
that
have
been
roman
camps
or
roads
where
there
is
always
serenity
and
the
spirit
of
a
purpose
at
rest
and
the
sunlight
flashes
upon
more
than
flint
here
one
is
perpetually
a
the
land
is
virginal
the
wind
cleaner
than
elsewhere
and
every
lake
and
each
day
is
the
first
day
the
flowers
are
less
conscious
than
english
flowers
the
breezes
have
nothing
to
remember
and
everything
to
promise
there
walk
as
yet
no
ghosts
of
lovers
in
canadian
lanes
this
is
the
essence
of
the
grey
freshness
and
brisk
melancholy
of
this
land
and
for
all
the
charm
of
those
qualities
it
is
also
the
secret
of
a
european
discontent
for
it
is
possible
at
a
pinch
to
do
without
gods
but
one
misses
the
dead
xiv
some
niggers
at
those
niggers
whose
are
they
an
american
suffragist
lady
on
board
entering
harbour
samoa
october
apropos
of
the
samoans
i
suppose
that
if
news
came
that
the
national
gallery
was
burnt
down
one
might
feel
while
hearing
of
the
general
damage
the
rooms
gutted
or
untouched
the
rembrandts
and
titians
saved
harmed
or
lost
a
sudden
disproportionately
keen
little
stab
of
wonder
the
pisanello
or
the
patinir
into
what
happened
to
so
now
there
must
be
a
handful
of
wanderers
here
and
there
who
among
all
the
major
conflagration
and
disasters
of
nations
and
continents
have
felt
the
tug
of
the
question
what
of
samoa
the
south
sea
islands
have
an
invincible
glamour
any
bar
in
or
sydney
will
give
you
tales
of
seamen
who
slipped
ashore
in
samoa
or
tahiti
or
the
marquesas
for
a
month
holiday
five
ten
or
twenty
years
ago
their
wives
and
families
await
them
yet
they
are
compound
these
islands
of
all
legendary
heavens
they
are
calypso
and
prospero
isle
and
the
hesperides
and
paradise
and
every
timeless
and
untroubled
spot
such
tales
have
been
made
of
them
by
men
who
have
been
there
and
gone
away
and
have
been
haunted
by
the
smell
of
the
bush
and
the
lagoons
and
faint
thunder
on
the
distant
reef
and
the
colours
of
sky
and
sea
and
coral
and
the
beauty
and
grace
of
the
islanders
and
the
queer
thing
is
that
it
all
almost
tiresomely
true
in
the
south
seas
the
creator
seems
to
have
laid
himself
out
to
show
what
he
do
imagine
an
island
with
the
most
perfect
climate
in
the
world
tropical
yet
almost
always
cooled
by
a
breeze
from
the
sea
no
malaria
or
other
fevers
no
dangerous
beasts
snakes
or
insects
fish
for
the
catching
and
fruits
for
the
plucking
and
an
earth
and
sky
and
sea
of
immortal
loveliness
what
more
could
civilisation
give
umbrellas
rope
gladstone
bags
any
one
of
the
vast
leaves
of
the
banana
is
more
waterproof
than
the
most
expensive
woven
stuff
and
from
the
first
tree
you
can
tear
off
a
long
strip
of
fibre
that
holds
better
than
any
rope
and
thirty
seconds
work
on
a
great
produces
a
which
will
carry
incredible
weights
all
day
and
can
be
thrown
away
in
the
evening
a
world
of
conveniences
and
the
things
which
civilisation
has
left
behind
or
missed
by
the
way
are
there
too
among
the
polynesians
beauty
and
courtesy
and
mirth
i
think
there
is
no
gift
of
mind
or
body
that
the
wise
value
which
these
people
lack
a
man
i
met
in
some
other
islands
who
had
travelled
much
all
over
the
world
said
to
me
i
have
found
no
man
in
or
out
of
europe
with
the
good
manners
and
dignity
of
the
samoan
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
irish
peasant
a
people
among
whom
an
italian
would
be
uncouth
and
a
hindu
vulgar
and
karsavina
would
seem
clumsy
and
helen
of
troy
a
frump
the
white
population
of
heaven
as
one
would
expect
is
very
small
but
as
one
would
expect
it
is
composed
of
americans
english
and
germans
about
half
germans
for
it
has
been
a
german
colony
for
some
fourteen
years
but
it
is
one
of
the
few
white
i
suppose
where
a
decent
white
need
feel
ashamed
of
himself
for
though
proper
to
deny
that
germans
can
colonise
they
have
certainly
ruled
samoa
very
well
in
some
part
no
doubt
the
luck
has
been
with
them
with
the
world
in
this
success
samoa
was
one
of
their
later
and
wiser
attempts
in
colonising
the
first
governor
was
herr
solf
the
present
secretary
for
the
colonies
who
is
reputed
to
have
started
the
administration
of
samoa
after
a
careful
examination
of
our
method
of
ruling
fiji
and
with
a
due
but
not
complete
regard
for
the
advice
of
the
chief
english
and
american
settlers
in
samoa
certainly
he
started
it
very
ably
and
wisely
by
luck
and
good
management
those
various
forces
which
might
destroy
the
beauty
of
samoa
are
almost
ineffectual
the
fact
that
the
missionaries
are
nearly
all
english
puts
a
slight
sufficient
chasm
between
the
spiritual
and
civil
powers
and
avoids
that
worst
peril
of
these
places
hierocracy
the
trade
of
the
islands
is
largely
a
monopoly
of
the
firm
a
big
affair
which
pays
a
few
people
in
hamburg
fabulous
percentages
so
smaller
traders
encouraged
to
flourish
unduly
and
the
german
firm
itself
is
too
well
fed
to
bother
about
extending
the
samoans
therefore
are
exploited
spiritually
or
commercially
as
much
as
they
might
be
by
such
slight
chances
beauty
keeps
a
foothold
in
the
world
the
missionary
peace
of
mind
may
require
that
the
samoan
should
wear
trousers
or
the
pocket
that
he
should
drink
gin
and
live
under
corrugated
iron
but
the
government
has
discovered
that
these
things
are
not
good
for
the
health
of
the
polynesian
so
the
samoan
wears
his
and
drinks
his
and
lives
in
his
cool
and
lovely
thatched
hut
and
is
happy
and
final
test
of
administration
the
population
is
no
longer
decreasing
but
i
think
there
more
than
luck
or
german
wisdom
at
the
bottom
of
the
happy
condition
of
samoa
something
in
the
very
magic
of
the
place
seems
to
subdue
or
soften
the
evil
in
men
heaven
forbid
i
should
deny
that
mean
and
treacherous
and
cruel
acts
of
white
men
and
brown
are
on
record
but
as
a
rule
the
greedy
or
the
boorish
once
they
settle
there
appear
to
mellow
and
grow
quiet
between
this
sea
and
sky
even
a
trader
becomes
almost
a
gentleman
even
a
prussian
almost
lovable
and
the
very
missionaries
are
betrayed
by
beauty
and
contentment
takes
them
unaware
samoa
has
been
well
governed
the
people
have
been
forbidden
a
few
perils
of
civilisation
and
for
the
rest
are
left
pretty
well
to
themselves
go
up
from
apia
across
the
mountains
or
round
the
coast
or
take
a
boat
over
to
the
other
big
island
savaii
and
you
find
them
living
their
old
life
fishing
and
bathing
and
singing
and
never
a
sign
of
a
white
man
they
are
guaranteed
possession
of
their
land
sometimes
complain
faintly
of
a
small
the
government
exacts
which
compels
the
individual
to
some
four
or
five
days
work
a
year
the
english
inhabitants
themselves
have
had
no
grumble
against
the
germans
except
that
they
incline
to
be
kind
to
the
natives
an
admirable
testimonial
and
traders
in
the
pacific
say
they
always
get
far
better
treatment
from
the
customs
and
harbour
authorities
at
apia
than
at
the
british
suva
in
fiji
and
yet
the
samoans
do
not
like
the
germans
when
i
was
there
nearly
a
year
ago
i
was
often
asked
when
will
peritania
britain
fight
germany
and
send
her
away
from
samoa
they
have
no
complaint
against
the
germans
they
have
merely
a
sentimental
and
highly
flattering
preference
for
the
english
on
a
recent
visit
of
an
english
gunboat
to
apia
the
officers
were
entertained
at
a
samoan
dinner
party
with
music
and
dances
by
an
eminent
and
very
charming
young
princess
the
princess
is
a
famous
beauty
with
the
keen
intelligence
samoans
have
if
they
care
a
wonderful
dancer
possessed
of
a
glorious
singing
voice
and
a
perfect
knowledge
of
english
the
party
was
a
great
success
the
princess
led
her
guests
afterwards
to
the
before
anyone
could
stop
her
she
leapt
on
to
the
pole
and
raced
up
the
sixty
feet
of
it
that
also
is
among
the
accomplishments
of
a
samoan
princess
she
seized
the
german
flag
tore
it
to
pieces
brought
it
down
and
danced
on
it
so
the
tale
is
and
it
is
probably
true
in
the
villages
where
i
stayed
it
was
amusing
how
swiftly
and
completely
the
children
forgot
the
few
words
of
german
the
government
sometimes
had
them
taught
while
one
or
two
common
phrases
were
retained
as
extremely
good
jokes
by
the
boys
and
girls
occasions
of
inextinguishable
laughter
through
the
absurdity
of
their
sound
and
the
very
ridiculous
of
them
i
wish
i
were
there
again
it
is
a
country
and
a
life
that
bind
the
heart
there
is
a
poem
i
know
an
island
lovely
and
lost
and
half
the
world
away
and
there
lowland
and
highland
lies
a
pool
rich
with
murmur
and
scent
and
glimmer
and
there
my
friends
go
all
the
radiant
day
each
and
laughing
swimmer
and
so
on
it
tells
how
ugly
and
joyless
by
comparison
the
own
country
sometimes
seems
filled
with
and
fogs
and
such
grey
things
evil
and
gloom
and
cold
o
nights
in
my
land
but
i
know
an
island
where
beauty
and
courtesy
as
flowers
blow
so
it
goes
with
a
jolly
return
on
the
rhyme
but
the
whole
poem
is
a
bad
one
still
the
man
felt
it
the
magic
it
is
a
magic
of
a
different
way
of
life
in
the
south
seas
if
you
live
the
south
sea
life
the
intellect
soon
lapses
into
quiescence
the
body
becomes
more
active
the
senses
and
perceptions
more
lordly
and
acute
it
is
a
life
of
swimming
and
climbing
and
resting
after
exertion
the
skin
seems
to
grow
more
sensitive
to
light
and
air
and
the
feel
of
water
and
the
earth
and
leaves
hour
after
hour
one
may
float
in
the
warm
lagoons
conscious
in
the
whole
body
of
every
shred
and
current
of
the
multitudinous
water
or
diving
under
in
a
vain
attempt
to
catch
the
radiant
fish
that
flit
in
and
out
of
the
thousand
windows
of
their
gorgeous
coral
palaces
or
go
up
one
of
a
singing
crowd
to
a
shaded
pool
of
a
river
in
the
bush
cool
from
the
mountains
the
darkness
is
streaked
with
the
bodies
that
fling
themselves
head
or
feet
first
from
the
cliffs
around
the
water
and
the
haunted
is
broken
by
laughter
it
is
part
of
the
charm
of
these
people
that
while
they
are
not
so
foolish
as
to
their
intelligence
is
incredibly
lively
and
subtle
their
sense
of
humour
and
their
intuitions
of
other
people
feelings
are
very
keen
and
living
they
have
built
up
in
the
long
centuries
of
their
civilisation
a
delicate
and
noble
complexity
of
behaviour
and
of
personal
relationships
a
white
man
living
with
them
soon
feels
his
mind
as
deplorably
dull
as
his
skin
is
pale
and
unhealthy
among
those
glorious
bodies
but
even
he
soon
learns
to
his
body
and
so
his
true
mind
instead
of
using
it
as
a
stupid
convenience
for
his
personality
a
moment
umbrella
against
this
world
he
is
perpetually
and
intensely
aware
of
the
subtleties
of
taste
in
food
of
every
tint
and
line
of
the
incomparable
glories
of
those
dawns
and
evenings
of
each
shade
of
intercourse
in
fishing
or
swimming
or
dancing
with
the
best
companions
in
the
world
that
alone
is
life
all
else
is
death
and
after
dark
the
black
palms
against
a
tropic
night
the
smell
of
the
wind
the
tangible
moonlight
like
a
white
dry
translucent
mist
the
lights
in
the
huts
the
murmur
and
laughter
of
passing
figures
the
passionate
queer
thrill
of
the
rhythm
of
some
hidden
dance
all
this
will
seem
to
him
inexplicably
and
almost
unbearably
a
scene
his
heart
has
known
long
ago
and
forgotten
and
yet
always
looked
for
and
now
samoa
is
ours
a
new
zealand
expeditionary
force
took
it
well
i
know
a
princess
who
will
have
had
the
day
of
her
life
did
they
see
stevenson
tomb
gleaming
high
up
on
the
hill
as
they
made
for
that
passage
in
the
reef
did
vasa
with
his
eyes
and
that
infinitely
adorable
lady
fafaia
wander
down
to
the
beach
to
watch
them
land
they
must
have
landed
from
boats
and
at
noon
i
see
how
hot
they
got
i
know
that
apia
noon
did
they
rush
to
the
tivoli
bar
but
i
forget
new
zealanders
are
teetotalers
so
perhaps
the
samoans
gave
them
the
coolest
of
all
drinks
and
they
scored
and
what
dances
in
their
honour
that
night
but
again
i
afraid
the
would
shock
a
new
zealander
i
suppose
they
left
a
garrison
and
went
away
i
can
very
vividly
see
them
steaming
out
in
the
evening
and
the
crowd
on
shore
would
be
singing
them
that
sweetest
and
of
south
sea
songs
which
begins
my
flenni
pronounce
it
and
goes
on
in
samoan
a
very
beautiful
tongue
i
hope
they
rule
samoa
well
an
unusual
young
man
some
say
the
declaration
of
war
threw
us
into
a
primitive
abyss
of
hatred
and
the
lust
for
blood
others
declare
that
we
behaved
very
well
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
the
thoughts
that
flowed
through
the
mind
of
a
friend
of
mine
when
he
heard
the
news
my
friend
i
shall
make
no
endeavour
to
excuse
him
is
a
normal
even
ordinary
man
wholly
english
years
old
active
and
given
to
music
by
a
chance
he
was
ignorant
of
the
events
of
the
world
during
the
last
days
of
july
he
was
camping
with
some
friends
in
a
remote
part
of
cornwall
and
had
gone
on
with
a
companion
for
a
sail
so
it
was
till
they
beached
her
again
that
they
heard
a
youth
ran
down
to
them
with
a
telegram
we
at
war
with
germany
we
joined
france
and
russia
my
friend
ate
and
drank
and
then
climbed
a
hill
of
gorse
and
sat
alone
looking
at
the
sea
his
mind
was
full
of
confused
images
and
the
sense
of
strain
in
answer
to
the
word
a
train
of
vague
thoughts
dragged
across
his
brain
the
pompous
vulgarity
of
the
building
of
berlin
the
wide
and
restful
beauty
of
munich
the
taste
of
beer
innumerable
quiet
glittering
the
the
swish
of
evening
air
in
the
face
as
one
down
past
the
pines
a
certain
angle
of
the
eyes
in
the
face
long
nights
of
drinking
and
singing
and
laughter
the
admirable
beauty
of
german
wives
and
mothers
certain
friends
some
tunes
the
quiet
length
of
evening
over
the
between
him
and
the
cornish
sea
he
saw
quite
clearly
an
april
morning
on
a
lake
south
of
berlin
the
grey
water
slipping
past
his
little
boat
and
a
suddenly
revealed
against
hanging
up
blue
and
scarlet
garments
to
dry
in
the
sun
children
played
about
her
and
she
sang
as
she
worked
and
he
remembered
a
night
in
munich
spent
with
a
students
from
eight
to
one
they
had
continually
emptied
immense
jugs
of
beer
and
smoked
and
sung
english
and
german
songs
in
profound
chorus
and
when
the
party
broke
up
he
found
himself
with
the
president
who
was
a
vast
jew
and
with
an
apollonian
youth
called
leo
diringer
who
said
he
was
a
poet
there
was
also
a
fourth
man
of
whom
he
could
remember
no
detail
together
walking
with
ferocious
care
down
the
middle
of
the
street
they
had
swayed
through
schwabing
seeking
an
open
cafe
benz
was
closed
but
further
up
there
was
a
little
place
still
lighted
inhabited
by
one
waiter
innumerable
chairs
and
tables
piled
on
each
other
for
the
night
and
a
row
of
in
front
of
which
sat
a
little
bald
bearded
man
in
waiting
the
little
man
seemed
to
them
infinitely
pathetic
four
against
one
they
played
him
at
chess
and
were
beaten
they
bowed
and
passed
into
the
night
leo
diringer
recited
a
sonnet
and
slept
suddenly
at
the
foot
of
a
the
eyes
shone
with
a
final
flicker
of
caution
and
he
turned
homeward
resolutely
to
the
last
not
wholly
drunk
my
friend
had
wandered
to
his
lodgings
in
an
infinite
peace
he
could
not
remember
what
had
happened
to
the
fourth
man
a
thousand
little
figures
tumbled
through
his
mind
but
they
no
longer
brought
with
them
that
air
of
comfortable
kindliness
which
germany
had
always
signified
for
him
something
in
him
kept
urging
you
must
hate
these
things
find
evil
in
them
there
was
that
agony
of
breaking
a
mental
habit
painting
out
a
mass
of
associations
which
he
had
felt
in
ceasing
to
believe
in
a
religion
or
more
acutely
after
quarrelling
with
a
friend
he
knew
that
was
absurd
the
picture
came
to
him
of
encountering
the
jew
or
diringer
or
old
wolf
or
little
streckmann
the
pianist
in
a
raid
on
the
east
coast
or
on
the
continent
slashing
at
them
in
a
stagey
battle
ridiculous
he
vaguely
imagined
a
series
of
heroic
feats
vast
enterprise
and
the
applause
of
crowds
from
that
egotism
he
was
awakened
to
a
different
one
by
the
thought
that
this
day
meant
war
and
the
change
of
all
things
he
knew
he
realised
with
increasing
resentment
that
music
would
be
neglected
and
he
would
be
able
for
example
to
camp
out
he
might
have
to
volunteer
for
military
training
and
service
some
of
his
friends
would
be
killed
the
russian
ballet
would
return
his
own
relationship
with
a
a
girl
he
intermittently
adored
would
be
changed
absurd
but
inevitable
because
he
scarcely
worded
it
to
himself
he
and
she
and
everyone
else
were
going
to
be
different
his
mind
fluttered
irascibly
to
escape
from
this
thought
but
still
came
back
to
it
like
a
tethered
bird
then
he
became
calmer
and
wandered
out
for
a
time
into
fantasy
a
cloud
over
the
sun
woke
him
to
consciousness
of
his
own
thoughts
and
he
found
with
perplexity
that
they
were
continually
recurring
to
two
periods
of
his
life
the
days
after
the
death
of
his
mother
and
the
time
of
his
first
deep
estrangement
from
one
he
loved
after
a
bit
he
understood
this
now
as
then
his
mind
had
been
completely
divided
into
two
parts
the
upper
running
about
aimlessly
from
one
thought
to
another
the
lower
unconscious
half
labouring
with
some
profound
and
unknowable
change
this
feeling
of
ignorant
helplessness
linked
him
with
those
past
crises
his
consciousness
was
like
the
light
scurry
of
waves
at
full
tide
when
the
deeper
waters
are
pausing
and
gathering
and
turning
home
something
was
growing
in
his
heart
and
he
could
tell
what
but
as
he
thought
and
germany
the
word
seemed
to
flash
like
a
line
of
foam
with
a
sudden
tightening
of
his
heart
he
realised
that
there
might
be
a
raid
on
the
english
coast
he
did
imagine
any
possibility
of
it
but
only
of
enemies
and
warfare
on
english
soil
the
idea
sickened
him
he
was
immensely
surprised
to
perceive
that
the
actual
earth
of
england
held
for
him
a
quality
which
he
found
in
a
and
in
a
friend
honour
and
scarcely
anywhere
else
a
quality
which
if
he
ever
been
sentimental
enough
to
use
the
word
he
have
called
his
astonishment
grew
as
the
full
flood
of
swept
him
on
from
thought
to
thought
he
felt
the
triumphant
helplessness
of
a
lover
grey
uneven
little
fields
and
small
ancient
hedges
rushed
before
him
wild
flowers
elms
and
beeches
gentleness
sedate
houses
of
red
brick
proudly
unassuming
a
countryside
of
rambling
hills
and
friendly
copses
he
seemed
to
be
raised
high
looking
down
on
a
landscape
compounded
of
the
western
view
from
the
cotswolds
and
the
weald
and
the
high
land
in
wiltshire
and
the
midlands
seen
from
the
hills
above
risborough
and
all
this
to
the
accompaniment
of
tunes
heard
long
ago
an
intolerable
number
of
them
being
hymns
there
was
in
his
mind
a
confused
multitude
of
faces
to
most
of
which
he
could
not
put
a
name
at
one
moment
he
was
on
an
atlantic
liner
sick
for
home
making
plymouth
at
nightfall
and
at
another
diving
into
a
little
rocky
pool
through
which
the
teign
flows
north
of
bovey
and
again
waking
stiff
with
dew
to
see
the
dawn
come
up
over
the
royston
plain
and
continually
he
seemed
to
see
the
set
of
a
mouth
which
he
knew
for
his
mother
and
a
face
and
inexplicably
the
face
of
an
old
man
he
had
once
passed
in
a
warwickshire
village
to
his
great
disgust
the
most
commonplace
sentiments
found
utterance
in
him
at
the
same
time
he
was
extraordinarily
happy
my
friend
who
has
always
though
never
very
passionately
believed
himself
a
most
unusual
young
man
rose
to
his
feet
feeling
a
little
frightened
and
more
than
a
little
unwell
for
he
is
a
person
of
quiet
mental
habits
he
wandered
down
the
hill
he
kept
slowly
moving
his
head
like
a
man
who
wishes
to
dodge
a
pain
i
gather
that
he
was
conscious
of
few
definite
thoughts
till
he
reached
the
london
train
he
kept
remembering
unwillingly
a
midnight
in
in
munich
when
he
had
seen
a
clown
a
pierrot
and
a
columbine
delicately
round
the
deserted
corner
of
and
vanish
into
the
darkness
then
he
thought
of
the
lights
on
the
pavement
in
trafalgar
square
it
seemed
to
him
the
most
desirable
thing
in
the
world
to
mingle
and
talk
with
a
great
many
english
people
also
he
kept
saying
to
himself
for
he
felt
vaguely
jealous
of
the
young
men
in
germany
and
france
well
if
armageddon
i
suppose
one
should
be
there
of
france
he
tells
me
he
thought
little
the
french
always
seemed
to
him
people
to
be
respected
but
very
remote
more
incomprehensible
than
the
japanese
more
even
than
the
irish
of
russia
less
she
meant
nothing
to
him
except
a
sense
of
hysteria
and
vague
evil
which
he
had
been
given
by
some
of
her
music
and
literature
he
thought
often
and
heavily
of
germany
of
england
all
the
time
he
did
know
whether
he
was
glad
or
sad
it
was
a
new
feeling
