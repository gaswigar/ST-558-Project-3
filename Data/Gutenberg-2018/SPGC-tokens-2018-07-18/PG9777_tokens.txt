laughed
away
the
gloom

borrow
from

he
laughed
across
the
ocean
of
a
happy
life

passed
with
a
laugh
of
glad
emotion
into
paradise
at
last

knew
him

had
gathered
to
await
his
coming

run

him

leered
round

clucked

he

what

he
clapped
his
heels
and
i
sighed
to
see
that
he
had
hands
where
his
feet
should
be
then
a
goblin
gray

bowed
his
head

i

him
slip
his
eyebrows
off

looked

them
over

lighted

began
the
most
indestructible
man
for

years

on

was
my
grandfather
squeers
he
said
when
he
rounded
his
the
hang
of
it
now
and
can
do
it
again
he
had
frozen
his
heels
so
repeatedly
he
could
tell
by
them
just
what
the
weather
would
be
and
would
laugh
and
declare
the
would
most
falsely
prognosticate
never
could
such
a

constitution

grandfather
squeers
that
he
used
for
sixty
odd
years
he
still
chewed
a
six
days
of
the
week
while
the
seventh
he
passed
with
a
chew
in
each
cheek
then
my
grandfather
squeers
had
a
singular
knack
of
sitting
around
on
the
small
of
his
back
with
his
legs
like
a
letter
y
stretched
the
grate
wherein
was
his
custom
to

was
fond
of
tobacco
in
ways

would
sit
on
the
of
sunshiny
days
and
smoke
he
raised
strictly
for
the
pipe
he
used
all
through
the
mexican
war

the
raggedy
man
said
refilling
the
bowl
of
his
own
pipe
and
leisurely
picking
a
coal
from
the
stove
with
his
finger
and
thumb
you
can
see
what
a
habit
he
fastened
on
me
and
my
grandfather
squeers
took
a
special
delight
in
pruning
his
corns
every
saturday
night
with
a
razor
whose
edge
he
excused
by
saying
was
one
that
his
grandfather
used

though
deeply
etched
in
the
haft
of
the

felt

a

to
live
over
the
past

the
country
was
wild

unbroken

vast
the
little
log
cabin
was
just
plenty
fine
for
himself
his
companion

fambly

nine
they
did
have
even
a
pump

a
tin

drunk
year
out

in
the
gourd
that
was
sweeter
by
odds
than
the
goblets
of
gold
at
the
lips
of
the

the
raggedy
man
paused
to
plaintively
say
it
was
clockin
along
the
close
of
the
day

he
to
get
back
to
his
work
on

lawn
then
dreamily
blubbered
his
pipe
and
went
on
his
teeth
were
imperfect
my
grandfather
owned
that
he
could
eat
oysters
unless
they
were
and
his
eyes
were
so
weak
and
so
feeble
of
sight
he
could
sleep
with
them
unless
every
night
he
put
on
his
spectacles
all
he
possessed
three
pairs
with
his
goggles
on
top
of
the
rest
and
my
grandfather
always
retiring
at
night
blew
down
the

put
out

light

he
curl
up
on

a
shaving
in
bed
and
puff
and
smoke
pipes
in
his
sleep
it
is
said
and
would
snore
oftentimes
as
the
legends
relate
till
his
folks
were
wrought
up
to
a
terrible
state
then
he
snort
and
rear
up
and
roll
over
and
there
in
the
subsequent
hush
they
could
hear
him
chew
air
and
so
glaringly
bald
was
the
top
of
his
head
that
many
the
time
he
has
musingly
said
as
his
eyes
journeyed

reflex
in

glass

set
out

of
off

so
remarkably
deaf
was
my
grandfather
squeers
that
he
had
to
wear
over
his
ears
to
even
hear
thunder

oftentimes
then
he
was
forced

request
it
to
thunder

that
all
illustration
envoy
envoy
many
pleasures
of
youth
have
been
buoyantly
sung
and
borne
on
the
winds
of
delight
may
they
beat
with
their
palpitant
wings
at
the
hearts
of
the
young
and
in
bosoms
of
age
find
as
warm
a
retreat
yet
sweetest
of
all
of
the
musical
throng
though
least
of
the
numbers
that
upward
aspire
is
the
one
rising
now
into
wavering
song
as
i
sit
in
the
silence
and
gaze
in
the
fire
is
a
winter
long
dead
that
beleaguers
my
door
and
muffles
his
steps
in
the
snows
of
the
past
and
i
see
in
the
embers
i
dreaming
before
lost
faces
of
love
as
they
looked
on
me
last
the
round
laughing
eyes
of
the
of
old
gleam
out
for
a
moment
with
truant
desire
then
fade
and
are
lost
in
a
city
of
gold
as
i
sit
in
the
silence
and
gaze
in
the
fire
and
then
comes
the
face
peering
back
in
my
own
of
a
shy
little
girl
with
her
lids
drooping
low
as
she
faltering
tells
in
a
tone
the
ghost
of
a
story
of
long
long
then
her
dewy
blue
eyes
they
are
lifted
again
but
i
see
their
glad
light
slowly
fail
and
expire
as
i
reach
and
cry
to
her
in
vain
all
in
vain
as
i
sit
in
the
silence
and
gaze
in
the
fire
then
the
face
of
a
mother
looks
back
through
the
mist
of
tears
that
are
welling
and
lucent
with
light
i
see
the
dear
smile
of
the
lips
i
have
kissed
as
she
knelt
by
my
cradle
at
morning
and
night
and
my
arms
are
outheld
with
a
yearning
too
wild
for
any
but
god
in
his
love
to
inspire
as
she
pleads
at
the
foot
of
his
throne
for
her
child
as
i
sit
in
the
silence
and
gaze
in
the
fire
o
pathos
of
rapture
o
glorious
pain
my
heart
is
a
blossom
of
joy
with
a
shower
of
tears
as
a
lily
with
rain
that
weeps
in
the
shadow
and
laughs
in
the
sun
the
blight
of
the
frost
may
descend
on
the
tree
and
the
leaf
and
the
flower
may
fall
and
expire
but
ever
and
ever
love
blossoms
for
me
as
i
sit
in
the
silence
and
gaze
in
the
fire
