leave
it
to
jeeves
jeeves
and
the
unbidden
guest
jeeves
and
the
egg
absent
treatment
helping
freddie
rallying
round
old
george
doing
clarence
a
bit
of
good
the
aunt
and
the
sluggard
leave
it
to
jeeves
jeeves
my
man
you
know
is
really
a
most
extraordinary
chap
so
capable
honestly
i
should
know
what
to
do
without
him
on
broader
lines
like
those
chappies
who
sit
peering
sadly
over
the
marble
battlements
at
the
pennsylvania
station
in
the
place
marked
inquiries
you
know
the
johnnies
i
mean
you
go
up
to
them
and
say
when
the
next
train
for
melonsquashville
tennessee
and
they
reply
without
stopping
to
think
track
ten
change
at
san
francisco
and
right
every
time
well
jeeves
gives
you
just
the
same
impression
of
omniscience
as
an
instance
of
what
i
mean
i
remember
meeting
monty
byng
in
bond
street
one
morning
looking
the
last
word
in
a
grey
check
suit
and
i
felt
i
should
never
be
happy
till
i
had
one
like
it
i
dug
the
address
of
the
tailors
out
of
him
and
had
them
working
on
the
thing
inside
the
hour
jeeves
i
said
that
evening
i
getting
a
check
suit
like
that
one
of
mr
byng
injudicious
sir
he
said
firmly
it
will
not
become
you
what
absolute
rot
it
the
soundest
thing
i
struck
for
years
unsuitable
for
you
sir
well
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
was
that
the
confounded
thing
came
home
and
i
put
it
on
and
when
i
caught
sight
of
myself
in
the
glass
i
nearly
swooned
jeeves
was
perfectly
right
i
looked
a
cross
between
a
comedian
and
a
cheap
bookie
yet
monty
had
looked
fine
in
absolutely
the
same
stuff
these
things
are
just
life
mysteries
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
but
it
is
only
that
jeeves
judgment
about
clothes
is
infallible
though
of
course
that
really
the
main
thing
the
man
knows
everything
there
was
the
matter
of
that
tip
on
the
lincolnshire
i
forget
now
how
i
got
it
but
it
had
the
aspect
of
being
the
real
tabasco
jeeves
i
said
for
i
fond
of
the
man
and
like
to
do
him
a
good
turn
when
i
can
if
you
want
to
make
a
bit
of
money
have
something
on
wonderchild
for
the
he
shook
his
head
i
rather
not
sir
but
it
the
straight
goods
i
going
to
put
my
shirt
on
him
i
do
not
recommend
it
sir
the
animal
is
not
intended
to
win
second
place
is
what
the
stable
is
after
perfect
piffle
i
thought
of
course
how
the
deuce
could
jeeves
know
anything
about
it
still
you
know
what
happened
wonderchild
led
till
he
was
breathing
on
the
wire
and
then
banana
fritter
came
along
and
nosed
him
out
i
went
straight
home
and
rang
for
jeeves
after
this
i
said
not
another
step
for
me
without
your
advice
from
now
on
consider
yourself
the
brains
of
the
establishment
very
good
sir
i
shall
endeavour
to
give
satisfaction
and
he
has
by
jove
i
a
bit
short
on
brain
myself
the
old
bean
would
appear
to
have
been
constructed
more
for
ornament
than
for
use
do
you
know
but
give
me
five
minutes
to
talk
the
thing
over
with
jeeves
and
i
game
to
advise
any
one
about
anything
and
that
why
when
bruce
corcoran
came
to
me
with
his
troubles
my
first
act
was
to
ring
the
bell
and
put
it
up
to
the
lad
with
the
bulging
forehead
leave
it
to
jeeves
i
said
i
first
got
to
know
corky
when
i
came
to
new
york
he
was
a
pal
of
my
cousin
gussie
who
was
in
with
a
lot
of
people
down
washington
square
way
i
do
know
if
i
ever
told
you
about
it
but
the
reason
why
i
left
england
was
because
i
was
sent
over
by
my
aunt
agatha
to
try
to
stop
young
gussie
marrying
a
girl
on
the
vaudeville
stage
and
i
got
the
whole
thing
so
mixed
up
that
i
decided
that
it
would
be
a
sound
scheme
for
me
to
stop
on
in
america
for
a
bit
instead
of
going
back
and
having
long
cosy
chats
about
the
thing
with
aunt
so
i
sent
jeeves
out
to
find
a
decent
apartment
and
settled
down
for
a
bit
of
exile
bound
to
say
that
new
york
a
topping
place
to
be
exiled
in
everybody
was
awfully
good
to
me
and
there
seemed
to
be
plenty
of
things
going
on
and
i
a
wealthy
bird
so
everything
was
fine
chappies
introduced
me
to
other
chappies
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
it
was
long
before
i
knew
squads
of
the
right
sort
some
who
rolled
in
dollars
in
houses
up
by
the
park
and
others
who
lived
with
the
gas
turned
down
mostly
around
washington
square
artists
and
writers
and
so
forth
brainy
coves
corky
was
one
of
the
artists
a
he
called
himself
but
he
had
painted
any
portraits
he
was
sitting
on
the
with
a
blanket
over
his
shoulders
waiting
for
a
chance
to
get
into
the
game
you
see
the
catch
about
i
looked
into
the
thing
a
bit
is
that
you
ca
start
painting
portraits
till
people
come
along
and
ask
you
to
and
they
wo
come
and
ask
you
to
until
you
painted
a
lot
first
this
makes
it
kind
of
difficult
for
a
chappie
corky
managed
to
get
along
by
drawing
an
occasional
picture
for
the
comic
papers
he
had
rather
a
gift
for
funny
stuff
when
he
got
a
good
idea
and
doing
bedsteads
and
chairs
and
things
for
the
advertisements
his
principal
source
of
income
however
was
derived
from
biting
the
ear
of
a
rich
uncle
one
alexander
worple
who
was
in
the
jute
business
i
a
bit
foggy
as
to
what
jute
is
but
apparently
something
the
populace
is
pretty
keen
on
for
worple
had
made
quite
an
indecently
large
stack
out
of
it
now
a
great
many
fellows
think
that
having
a
rich
uncle
is
a
pretty
soft
snap
but
according
to
corky
such
is
not
the
case
corky
uncle
was
a
robust
sort
of
cove
who
looked
like
living
for
ever
he
was
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
might
go
to
par
it
was
not
this
however
that
distressed
poor
old
corky
for
he
was
not
bigoted
and
had
no
objection
to
the
man
going
on
living
what
corky
kicked
at
was
the
way
the
above
worple
used
to
harry
him
corky
uncle
you
see
did
want
him
to
be
an
artist
he
think
he
had
any
talent
in
that
direction
he
was
always
urging
him
to
chuck
art
and
go
into
the
jute
business
and
start
at
the
bottom
and
work
his
way
up
jute
had
apparently
become
a
sort
of
obsession
with
him
he
seemed
to
attach
almost
a
spiritual
importance
to
it
and
what
corky
said
was
that
while
he
did
know
what
they
did
at
the
bottom
of
the
jute
business
instinct
told
him
that
it
was
something
too
beastly
for
words
corky
moreover
believed
in
his
future
as
an
artist
some
day
he
said
he
was
going
to
make
a
hit
meanwhile
by
using
the
utmost
tact
and
persuasiveness
he
was
inducing
his
uncle
to
cough
up
very
grudgingly
a
small
quarterly
allowance
he
would
have
got
this
if
his
uncle
had
had
a
hobby
worple
was
peculiar
in
this
respect
as
a
rule
from
what
i
observed
the
american
captain
of
industry
does
do
anything
out
of
business
hours
when
he
has
put
the
cat
out
and
locked
up
the
office
for
the
night
he
just
relapses
into
a
state
of
coma
from
which
he
emerges
only
to
start
being
a
captain
of
industry
again
but
worple
in
his
spare
time
was
what
is
known
as
an
ornithologist
he
had
written
a
book
called
and
was
writing
another
to
be
called
american
when
he
had
finished
that
the
presumption
was
that
he
would
begin
a
third
and
keep
on
till
the
supply
of
american
birds
gave
out
corky
used
to
go
to
him
about
once
every
three
months
and
let
him
talk
about
american
birds
apparently
you
could
do
what
you
liked
with
old
worple
if
you
gave
him
his
head
first
on
his
pet
subject
so
these
little
chats
used
to
make
corky
allowance
all
right
for
the
time
being
but
it
was
pretty
rotten
for
the
poor
chap
there
was
the
frightful
suspense
you
see
and
apart
from
that
birds
except
when
broiled
and
in
the
society
of
a
cold
bottle
bored
him
stiff
to
complete
the
of
worple
he
was
a
man
of
extremely
uncertain
temper
and
his
general
tendency
was
to
think
that
corky
was
a
poor
chump
and
that
whatever
step
he
took
in
any
direction
on
his
own
account
was
just
another
proof
of
his
innate
idiocy
i
should
imagine
jeeves
feels
very
much
the
same
about
me
so
when
corky
trickled
into
my
apartment
one
afternoon
shooing
a
girl
in
front
of
him
and
said
bertie
i
want
you
to
meet
my
fianc√©e
miss
singer
the
aspect
of
the
matter
which
hit
me
first
was
precisely
the
one
which
he
had
come
to
consult
me
about
the
very
first
words
i
spoke
were
corky
how
about
your
uncle
the
poor
chap
gave
one
of
those
mirthless
laughs
he
was
looking
anxious
and
worried
like
a
man
who
has
done
the
murder
all
right
but
ca
think
what
the
deuce
to
do
with
the
body
we
so
scared
wooster
said
the
girl
we
were
hoping
that
you
might
suggest
a
way
of
breaking
it
to
him
muriel
singer
was
one
of
those
very
quiet
appealing
girls
who
have
a
way
of
looking
at
you
with
their
big
eyes
as
if
they
thought
you
were
the
greatest
thing
on
earth
and
wondered
that
you
had
got
on
to
it
yet
yourself
she
sat
there
in
a
sort
of
shrinking
way
looking
at
me
as
if
she
were
saying
to
herself
oh
i
do
hope
this
great
strong
man
is
going
to
hurt
me
she
gave
a
fellow
a
protective
kind
of
feeling
made
him
want
to
stroke
her
hand
and
say
there
there
little
one
or
words
to
that
effect
she
made
me
feel
that
there
was
nothing
i
would
do
for
her
she
was
rather
like
one
of
those
american
drinks
which
creep
imperceptibly
into
your
system
so
that
before
you
know
what
you
doing
you
starting
out
to
reform
the
world
by
force
if
necessary
and
pausing
on
your
way
to
tell
the
large
man
in
the
corner
that
if
he
looks
at
you
like
that
you
will
knock
his
head
off
what
i
mean
is
she
made
me
feel
alert
and
dashing
like
a
jolly
old
or
something
of
that
kind
i
felt
that
i
was
with
her
in
this
thing
to
the
limit
i
do
see
why
your
uncle
should
be
most
awfully
bucked
i
said
to
corky
he
will
think
miss
singer
the
ideal
wife
for
you
corky
declined
to
cheer
up
you
do
know
him
even
if
he
did
like
muriel
he
would
admit
it
that
the
sort
of
guy
he
is
it
would
be
a
matter
of
principle
with
him
to
kick
all
he
would
consider
would
be
that
i
had
gone
and
taken
an
important
step
without
asking
his
advice
and
he
would
raise
cain
automatically
he
always
done
it
i
strained
the
old
bean
to
meet
this
emergency
you
want
to
work
it
so
that
he
makes
miss
singer
acquaintance
without
knowing
that
you
know
her
then
you
come
along
but
how
can
i
work
it
that
way
i
saw
his
point
that
was
the
catch
there
only
one
thing
to
do
i
said
what
that
leave
it
to
jeeves
and
i
rang
the
bell
sir
said
jeeves
kind
of
manifesting
himself
one
of
the
rummy
things
about
jeeves
is
that
unless
you
watch
like
a
hawk
you
very
seldom
see
him
come
into
a
room
he
like
one
of
those
weird
chappies
in
india
who
dissolve
themselves
into
thin
air
and
nip
through
space
in
a
sort
of
disembodied
way
and
assemble
the
parts
again
just
where
they
want
them
i
got
a
cousin
who
what
they
call
a
theosophist
and
he
says
he
often
nearly
worked
the
thing
himself
but
could
quite
bring
it
off
probably
owing
to
having
fed
in
his
boyhood
on
the
flesh
of
animals
slain
in
anger
and
pie
the
moment
i
saw
the
man
standing
there
registering
respectful
attention
a
weight
seemed
to
roll
off
my
mind
i
felt
like
a
lost
child
who
spots
his
father
in
the
offing
there
was
something
about
him
that
gave
me
confidence
jeeves
is
a
tallish
man
with
one
of
those
dark
shrewd
faces
his
eye
gleams
with
the
light
of
pure
intelligence
jeeves
we
want
your
advice
very
good
sir
i
boiled
down
corky
painful
case
into
a
few
words
so
you
see
what
it
amount
to
jeeves
we
want
you
to
suggest
some
way
by
which
worple
can
make
miss
singer
acquaintance
without
getting
on
to
the
fact
that
corcoran
already
knows
her
understand
perfectly
sir
well
try
to
think
of
something
i
have
thought
of
something
already
sir
you
have
the
scheme
i
would
suggest
can
not
fail
of
success
but
it
has
what
may
seem
to
you
a
drawback
sir
in
that
it
requires
a
certain
financial
outlay
he
means
i
translated
to
corky
that
he
has
got
a
pippin
of
an
idea
but
it
going
to
cost
a
bit
naturally
the
poor
chap
face
dropped
for
this
seemed
to
dish
the
whole
thing
but
i
was
still
under
the
influence
of
the
girl
melting
gaze
and
i
saw
that
this
was
where
i
started
in
as
a
you
can
count
on
me
for
all
that
sort
of
thing
corky
i
said
only
too
glad
carry
on
jeeves
i
would
suggest
sir
that
corcoran
take
advantage
of
attachment
to
ornithology
how
on
earth
did
you
know
that
he
was
fond
of
birds
it
is
the
way
these
new
york
apartments
are
constructed
sir
quite
unlike
our
london
houses
the
partitions
between
the
rooms
are
of
the
flimsiest
nature
with
no
wish
to
overhear
i
have
sometimes
heard
corcoran
expressing
himself
with
a
generous
strength
on
the
subject
i
have
mentioned
oh
well
why
should
not
the
young
lady
write
a
small
volume
to
be
entitled
let
us
say
children
book
of
american
and
dedicate
it
to
worple
a
limited
edition
could
be
published
at
your
expense
sir
and
a
great
deal
of
the
book
would
of
course
be
given
over
to
eulogistic
remarks
concerning
worple
own
larger
treatise
on
the
same
subject
i
should
recommend
the
dispatching
of
a
presentation
copy
to
worple
immediately
on
publication
accompanied
by
a
letter
in
which
the
young
lady
asks
to
be
allowed
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
one
to
whom
she
owes
so
much
this
would
i
fancy
produce
the
desired
result
but
as
i
say
the
expense
involved
would
be
considerable
i
felt
like
the
proprietor
of
a
performing
dog
on
the
vaudeville
stage
when
the
tyke
has
just
pulled
off
his
trick
without
a
hitch
i
had
betted
on
jeeves
all
along
and
i
had
known
that
he
would
let
me
down
it
beats
me
sometimes
why
a
man
with
his
genius
is
satisfied
to
hang
around
pressing
my
clothes
and
if
i
had
half
brain
i
should
have
a
stab
at
being
prime
minister
or
something
jeeves
i
said
that
is
absolutely
ripping
one
of
your
very
best
efforts
thank
you
sir
the
girl
made
an
objection
but
i
sure
i
could
write
a
book
about
anything
i
ca
even
write
good
letters
muriel
talents
said
corky
with
a
little
cough
lie
more
in
the
direction
of
the
drama
bertie
i
did
mention
it
before
but
one
of
our
reasons
for
being
a
trifle
nervous
as
to
how
uncle
alexander
will
receive
the
news
is
that
muriel
is
in
the
chorus
of
that
show
your
at
the
manhattan
it
absurdly
unreasonable
but
we
both
feel
that
that
fact
might
increase
uncle
alexander
natural
tendency
to
kick
like
a
steer
i
saw
what
he
meant
goodness
knows
there
was
fuss
enough
in
our
family
when
i
tried
to
marry
into
musical
comedy
a
few
years
ago
and
the
recollection
of
my
aunt
agatha
attitude
in
the
matter
of
gussie
and
the
vaudeville
girl
was
still
fresh
in
my
mind
i
do
know
why
it
is
one
of
these
psychology
sharps
could
explain
it
i
suppose
but
uncles
and
aunts
as
a
class
are
always
dead
against
the
drama
legitimate
or
otherwise
they
do
seem
able
to
stick
it
at
any
price
but
jeeves
had
a
solution
of
course
i
fancy
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
sir
to
find
some
impecunious
author
who
would
be
glad
to
do
the
actual
composition
of
the
volume
for
a
small
fee
it
is
only
necessary
that
the
young
lady
name
should
appear
on
the
title
page
that
true
said
corky
sam
patterson
would
do
it
for
a
hundred
dollars
he
writes
a
novelette
three
short
stories
and
ten
thousand
words
of
a
serial
for
one
of
the
magazines
under
different
names
every
month
a
little
thing
like
this
would
be
nothing
to
him
i
get
after
him
right
away
fine
will
that
be
all
sir
said
jeeves
very
good
sir
thank
you
sir
i
always
used
to
think
that
publishers
had
to
be
devilish
intelligent
fellows
loaded
down
with
the
grey
matter
but
i
got
their
number
now
all
a
publisher
has
to
do
is
to
write
cheques
at
intervals
while
a
lot
of
deserving
and
industrious
chappies
rally
round
and
do
the
real
work
i
know
because
i
been
one
myself
i
simply
sat
tight
in
the
old
apartment
with
a
and
in
due
season
a
topping
shiny
book
came
along
i
happened
to
be
down
at
corky
place
when
the
first
copies
of
children
book
of
american
bobbed
up
muriel
singer
was
there
and
we
were
talking
of
things
in
general
when
there
was
a
bang
at
the
door
and
the
parcel
was
delivered
it
was
certainly
some
book
it
had
a
red
cover
with
a
fowl
of
some
species
on
it
and
underneath
the
girl
name
in
gold
letters
i
opened
a
copy
at
random
often
of
a
spring
morning
it
said
at
the
top
of
page
as
you
wander
through
the
fields
you
will
hear
the
carelessly
flowing
warble
of
the
purple
finch
linnet
when
you
are
older
you
must
read
all
about
him
in
alexander
worple
wonderful
book
you
see
a
boost
for
the
uncle
right
away
and
only
a
few
pages
later
there
he
was
in
the
limelight
again
in
connection
with
the
cuckoo
it
was
great
stuff
the
more
i
read
the
more
i
admired
the
chap
who
had
written
it
and
jeeves
genius
in
putting
us
on
to
the
wheeze
i
did
see
how
the
uncle
could
fail
to
drop
you
ca
call
a
chap
the
world
greatest
authority
on
the
cuckoo
without
rousing
a
certain
disposition
towards
chumminess
in
him
it
a
cert
i
said
an
absolute
cinch
said
corky
and
a
day
or
two
later
he
meandered
up
the
avenue
to
my
apartment
to
tell
me
that
all
was
well
the
uncle
had
written
muriel
a
letter
so
dripping
with
the
milk
of
human
kindness
that
if
he
had
known
worple
handwriting
corky
would
have
refused
to
believe
him
the
author
of
it
any
time
it
suited
miss
singer
to
call
said
the
uncle
he
would
be
delighted
to
make
her
acquaintance
shortly
after
this
i
had
to
go
out
of
town
divers
sound
sportsmen
had
invited
me
to
pay
visits
to
their
country
places
and
it
was
for
several
months
that
i
settled
down
in
the
city
again
i
had
been
wondering
a
lot
of
course
about
corky
whether
it
all
turned
out
right
and
so
forth
and
my
first
evening
in
new
york
happening
to
pop
into
a
quiet
sort
of
little
restaurant
which
i
go
to
when
i
do
feel
inclined
for
the
bright
lights
i
found
muriel
singer
there
sitting
by
herself
at
a
table
near
the
door
corky
i
took
it
was
out
telephoning
i
went
up
and
passed
the
time
of
day
well
well
well
what
i
said
why
wooster
how
do
you
do
corky
around
i
beg
your
pardon
you
waiting
for
corky
are
you
oh
i
did
understand
no
i
not
waiting
for
him
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
sort
of
something
in
her
voice
a
kind
of
thingummy
you
know
i
say
you
have
had
a
row
with
corky
have
you
a
row
a
spat
do
you
know
little
misunderstanding
faults
on
both
sides
er
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
why
whatever
makes
you
think
that
oh
well
as
it
were
what
what
i
mean
is
i
thought
you
usually
dined
with
him
before
you
went
to
the
theatre
i
left
the
stage
now
suddenly
the
whole
thing
dawned
on
me
i
had
forgotten
what
a
long
time
i
had
been
away
why
of
course
i
see
now
you
married
yes
how
perfectly
topping
i
wish
you
all
kinds
of
happiness
thank
you
so
much
oh
alexander
she
said
looking
past
me
this
is
a
friend
of
mine
mr
wooster
i
spun
round
a
chappie
with
a
lot
of
stiff
grey
hair
and
a
red
sort
of
healthy
face
was
standing
there
rather
a
formidable
johnnie
he
looked
though
quite
peaceful
at
the
moment
i
want
you
to
meet
my
husband
wooster
wooster
is
a
friend
of
bruce
alexander
the
old
boy
grasped
my
hand
warmly
and
that
was
all
that
kept
me
from
hitting
the
floor
in
a
heap
the
place
was
rocking
absolutely
so
you
know
my
nephew
wooster
i
heard
him
say
i
wish
you
would
try
to
knock
a
little
sense
into
him
and
make
him
quit
this
playing
at
painting
but
i
have
an
idea
that
he
is
steadying
down
i
noticed
it
first
that
night
he
came
to
dinner
with
us
my
dear
to
be
introduced
to
you
he
seemed
altogether
quieter
and
more
serious
something
seemed
to
have
sobered
him
perhaps
you
will
give
us
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
dinner
wooster
or
have
you
dined
i
said
i
had
what
i
needed
then
was
air
not
dinner
i
felt
that
i
wanted
to
get
into
the
open
and
think
this
thing
out
when
i
reached
my
apartment
i
heard
jeeves
moving
about
in
his
lair
i
called
him
jeeves
i
said
now
is
the
time
for
all
good
men
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
party
a
stiff
first
of
all
and
then
i
a
bit
of
news
for
you
he
came
back
with
a
tray
and
a
long
glass
better
have
one
yourself
jeeves
you
need
it
later
on
perhaps
thank
you
sir
all
right
please
yourself
but
you
going
to
get
a
shock
you
remember
my
friend
mr
corcoran
yes
sir
and
the
girl
who
was
to
slide
gracefully
into
his
uncle
esteem
by
writing
the
book
on
birds
perfectly
sir
well
she
slid
she
married
the
uncle
he
took
it
without
blinking
you
ca
rattle
jeeves
that
was
always
a
development
to
be
feared
sir
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
were
expecting
it
it
crossed
my
mind
as
a
possibility
did
it
by
jove
well
i
think
you
might
have
warned
us
i
hardly
liked
to
take
the
liberty
sir
of
course
as
i
saw
after
i
had
had
a
bite
to
eat
and
was
in
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
what
had
happened
was
my
fault
if
you
come
down
to
it
i
could
be
expected
to
foresee
that
the
scheme
in
itself
a
would
skid
into
the
ditch
as
it
had
done
but
all
the
same
i
bound
to
admit
that
i
did
relish
the
idea
of
meeting
corky
again
until
time
the
great
healer
had
been
able
to
get
in
a
bit
of
soothing
work
i
cut
washington
square
out
absolutely
for
the
next
few
months
i
gave
it
the
complete
and
then
just
when
i
was
beginning
to
think
i
might
safely
pop
down
in
that
direction
and
gather
up
the
dropped
threads
so
to
speak
time
instead
of
working
the
healing
wheeze
went
and
pulled
the
most
awful
bone
and
put
the
lid
on
it
opening
the
paper
one
morning
i
read
that
alexander
worple
had
presented
her
husband
with
a
son
and
heir
i
was
so
darned
sorry
for
poor
old
corky
that
i
had
the
heart
to
touch
my
breakfast
i
told
jeeves
to
drink
it
himself
i
was
bowled
over
absolutely
it
was
the
limit
i
hardly
knew
what
to
do
i
wanted
of
course
to
rush
down
to
washington
square
and
grip
the
poor
blighter
silently
by
the
hand
and
then
thinking
it
over
i
had
the
nerve
absent
treatment
seemed
the
touch
i
gave
it
him
in
waves
but
after
a
month
or
so
i
began
to
hesitate
again
it
struck
me
that
it
was
playing
it
a
bit
on
the
poor
chap
avoiding
him
like
this
just
when
he
probably
wanted
his
pals
to
surge
round
him
most
i
pictured
him
sitting
in
his
lonely
studio
with
no
company
but
his
bitter
thoughts
and
the
pathos
of
it
got
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
bounded
straight
into
a
taxi
and
told
the
driver
to
go
all
out
for
the
studio
i
rushed
in
and
there
was
corky
hunched
up
at
the
easel
painting
away
while
on
the
model
throne
sat
a
female
of
middle
age
holding
a
baby
a
fellow
has
to
be
ready
for
that
sort
of
thing
oh
ah
i
said
and
started
to
back
out
corky
looked
over
his
shoulder
halloa
bertie
do
go
we
just
finishing
for
the
day
that
will
be
all
this
afternoon
he
said
to
the
nurse
who
got
up
with
the
baby
and
decanted
it
into
a
perambulator
which
was
standing
in
the
fairway
at
the
same
hour
mr
corcoran
yes
please
good
afternoon
good
afternoon
corky
stood
there
looking
at
the
door
and
then
he
turned
to
me
and
began
to
get
it
off
his
chest
fortunately
he
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
i
knew
all
about
what
had
happened
so
it
was
as
awkward
as
it
might
have
been
it
my
uncle
idea
he
said
muriel
does
know
about
it
yet
the
portrait
to
be
a
surprise
for
her
on
her
birthday
the
nurse
takes
the
kid
out
ostensibly
to
get
a
breather
and
they
beat
it
down
here
if
you
want
an
instance
of
the
irony
of
fate
bertie
get
acquainted
with
this
here
the
first
commission
i
have
ever
had
to
paint
a
portrait
and
the
sitter
is
that
human
poached
egg
that
has
butted
in
and
bounced
me
out
of
my
inheritance
can
you
beat
it
i
call
it
rubbing
the
thing
in
to
expect
me
to
spend
my
afternoons
gazing
into
the
ugly
face
of
a
little
brat
who
to
all
intents
and
purposes
has
hit
me
behind
the
ear
with
a
blackjack
and
swiped
all
i
possess
i
refuse
to
paint
the
portrait
because
if
i
did
my
uncle
would
stop
my
allowance
yet
every
time
i
look
up
and
catch
that
kid
vacant
eye
i
suffer
agonies
i
tell
you
bertie
sometimes
when
he
gives
me
a
patronizing
glance
and
then
turns
away
and
is
sick
as
if
it
revolted
him
to
look
at
me
i
come
within
an
ace
of
occupying
the
entire
front
page
of
the
evening
papers
as
the
latest
murder
sensation
there
are
moments
when
i
can
almost
see
the
headlines
young
artist
beans
baby
with
axe
i
patted
his
shoulder
silently
my
sympathy
for
the
poor
old
scout
was
too
deep
for
words
i
kept
away
from
the
studio
for
some
time
after
that
because
it
seem
right
to
me
to
intrude
on
the
poor
chappie
sorrow
besides
bound
to
say
that
nurse
intimidated
me
she
reminded
me
so
infernally
of
aunt
agatha
she
was
the
same
type
but
one
afternoon
corky
called
me
on
the
bertie
halloa
are
you
doing
anything
this
afternoon
nothing
special
you
could
come
down
here
could
you
what
the
trouble
anything
up
i
finished
the
portrait
good
boy
stout
work
yes
his
voice
sounded
rather
doubtful
the
fact
is
bertie
it
does
look
quite
right
to
me
there
something
about
it
my
coming
in
half
an
hour
to
inspect
it
and
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
i
kind
of
feel
i
like
your
moral
support
i
began
to
see
that
i
was
letting
myself
in
for
something
the
sympathetic
of
jeeves
seemed
to
me
to
be
indicated
you
think
he
cut
up
rough
he
may
i
threw
my
mind
back
to
the
chappie
i
had
met
at
the
restaurant
and
tried
to
picture
him
cutting
up
rough
it
was
only
too
easy
i
spoke
to
corky
firmly
on
the
telephone
i
come
i
said
good
but
only
if
i
may
bring
jeeves
why
jeeves
what
jeeves
got
to
do
with
it
who
wants
jeeves
jeeves
is
the
fool
who
suggested
the
scheme
that
has
led
listen
corky
old
top
if
you
think
i
am
going
to
face
that
uncle
of
yours
without
jeeves
support
you
mistaken
i
sooner
go
into
a
den
of
wild
beasts
and
bite
a
lion
on
the
back
of
the
neck
oh
all
right
said
corky
not
cordially
but
he
said
it
so
i
rang
for
jeeves
and
explained
the
situation
very
good
sir
said
jeeves
that
the
sort
of
chap
he
is
you
ca
rattle
him
we
found
corky
near
the
door
looking
at
the
picture
with
one
hand
up
in
a
defensive
sort
of
way
as
if
he
thought
it
might
swing
on
him
stand
right
where
you
are
bertie
he
said
without
moving
now
tell
me
honestly
how
does
it
strike
you
the
light
from
the
big
window
fell
right
on
the
picture
i
took
a
good
look
at
it
then
i
shifted
a
bit
nearer
and
took
another
look
then
i
went
back
to
where
i
had
been
at
first
because
it
had
seemed
quite
so
bad
from
there
well
said
corky
anxiously
i
hesitated
a
bit
of
course
old
man
i
only
saw
the
kid
once
and
then
only
for
a
moment
but
but
it
an
ugly
sort
of
kid
was
it
if
i
remember
rightly
as
ugly
as
that
i
looked
again
and
honesty
compelled
me
to
be
frank
i
do
see
how
it
could
have
been
old
chap
poor
old
corky
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
in
a
temperamental
sort
of
way
he
groaned
you
right
quite
bertie
something
gone
wrong
with
the
darned
thing
my
private
impression
is
that
without
knowing
it
i
worked
that
stunt
that
sargent
and
those
fellows
pull
painting
the
soul
of
the
sitter
i
got
through
the
mere
outward
appearance
and
have
put
the
child
soul
on
canvas
but
could
a
child
of
that
age
have
a
soul
like
that
i
do
see
how
he
could
have
managed
it
in
the
time
what
do
you
think
jeeves
i
doubt
it
sir
it
it
sorts
of
leers
at
you
does
it
you
noticed
that
too
said
corky
i
do
see
how
one
could
help
noticing
all
i
tried
to
do
was
to
give
the
little
brute
a
cheerful
expression
but
as
it
worked
out
he
looks
positively
dissipated
just
what
i
was
going
to
suggest
old
man
he
looks
as
if
he
were
in
the
middle
of
a
colossal
spree
and
enjoying
every
minute
of
it
you
think
so
jeeves
he
has
a
decidedly
inebriated
air
sir
corky
was
starting
to
say
something
when
the
door
opened
and
the
uncle
came
in
for
about
three
seconds
all
was
joy
jollity
and
goodwill
the
old
boy
shook
hands
with
me
slapped
corky
on
the
back
said
that
he
think
he
had
ever
seen
such
a
fine
day
and
whacked
his
leg
with
his
stick
jeeves
had
projected
himself
into
the
background
and
he
notice
him
well
bruce
my
boy
so
the
portrait
is
really
finished
is
it
really
finished
well
bring
it
out
let
have
a
look
at
it
this
will
be
a
wonderful
surprise
for
your
aunt
where
is
it
let
and
then
he
got
it
suddenly
when
he
was
set
for
the
punch
and
he
rocked
back
on
his
heels
oosh
he
exclaimed
and
for
perhaps
a
minute
there
was
one
of
the
scaliest
silences
i
ever
run
up
against
is
this
a
practical
joke
he
said
at
last
in
a
way
that
set
about
sixteen
draughts
cutting
through
the
room
at
once
i
thought
it
was
up
to
me
to
rally
round
old
corky
you
want
to
stand
a
bit
farther
away
from
it
i
said
you
perfectly
right
he
snorted
i
do
i
want
to
stand
so
far
away
from
it
that
i
ca
see
the
thing
with
a
telescope
he
turned
on
corky
like
an
untamed
tiger
of
the
jungle
who
has
just
located
a
chunk
of
meat
and
this
this
is
what
you
have
been
wasting
your
time
and
my
money
for
all
these
years
a
painter
i
would
let
you
paint
a
house
of
mine
i
gave
you
this
commission
thinking
that
you
were
a
competent
worker
and
this
this
this
extract
from
a
comic
coloured
supplement
is
the
result
he
swung
towards
the
door
lashing
his
tail
and
growling
to
himself
this
ends
it
if
you
wish
to
continue
this
foolery
of
pretending
to
be
an
artist
because
you
want
an
excuse
for
idleness
please
yourself
but
let
me
tell
you
this
unless
you
report
at
my
office
on
monday
morning
prepared
to
abandon
all
this
idiocy
and
start
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
to
work
your
way
up
as
you
should
have
done
half
a
dozen
years
ago
not
another
cent
not
another
cent
not
another
boosh
then
the
door
closed
and
he
was
no
longer
with
us
and
i
crawled
out
of
the
bombproof
shelter
corky
old
top
i
whispered
faintly
corky
was
standing
staring
at
the
picture
his
face
was
set
there
was
a
hunted
look
in
his
eye
well
that
finishes
it
he
muttered
brokenly
what
are
you
going
to
do
do
what
can
i
do
i
ca
stick
on
here
if
he
cuts
off
supplies
you
heard
what
he
said
i
shall
have
to
go
to
the
office
on
monday
i
could
think
of
a
thing
to
say
i
knew
exactly
how
he
felt
about
the
office
i
do
know
when
i
been
so
infernally
uncomfortable
it
was
like
hanging
round
trying
to
make
conversation
to
a
pal
who
just
been
sentenced
to
twenty
years
in
quod
and
then
a
soothing
voice
broke
the
silence
if
i
might
make
a
suggestion
sir
it
was
jeeves
he
had
slid
from
the
shadows
and
was
gazing
gravely
at
the
picture
upon
my
word
i
ca
give
you
a
better
idea
of
the
shattering
effect
of
corky
uncle
alexander
when
in
action
than
by
saying
that
he
had
absolutely
made
me
forget
for
the
moment
that
jeeves
was
there
i
wonder
if
i
have
ever
happened
to
mention
to
you
sir
a
digby
thistleton
with
whom
i
was
once
in
service
perhaps
you
have
met
him
he
was
a
financier
he
is
now
lord
bridgnorth
it
was
a
favourite
saying
of
his
that
there
is
always
a
way
the
first
time
i
heard
him
use
the
expression
was
after
the
failure
of
a
patent
depilatory
which
he
promoted
jeeves
i
said
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
i
mentioned
thistleton
sir
because
his
was
in
some
respects
a
parallel
case
to
the
present
one
his
depilatory
failed
but
he
did
not
despair
he
put
it
on
the
market
again
under
the
name
of
guaranteed
to
produce
a
full
crop
of
hair
in
a
few
months
it
was
advertised
if
you
remember
sir
by
a
humorous
picture
of
a
before
and
after
taking
and
made
such
a
substantial
fortune
that
thistleton
was
soon
afterwards
elevated
to
the
peerage
for
services
to
his
party
it
seems
to
me
that
if
corcoran
looks
into
the
matter
he
will
find
like
thistleton
that
there
is
always
a
way
worple
himself
suggested
the
solution
of
the
difficulty
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
he
compared
the
portrait
to
an
extract
from
a
coloured
comic
supplement
i
consider
the
suggestion
a
very
valuable
one
sir
corcoran
portrait
may
not
have
pleased
worple
as
a
likeness
of
his
only
child
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
editors
would
gladly
consider
it
as
a
foundation
for
a
series
of
humorous
drawings
if
corcoran
will
allow
me
to
make
the
suggestion
his
talent
has
always
been
for
the
humorous
there
is
something
about
this
picture
something
bold
and
vigorous
which
arrests
the
attention
i
feel
sure
it
would
be
highly
popular
corky
was
glaring
at
the
picture
and
making
a
sort
of
dry
sucking
noise
with
his
mouth
he
seemed
completely
overwrought
and
then
suddenly
he
began
to
laugh
in
a
wild
way
corky
old
man
i
said
massaging
him
tenderly
i
feared
the
poor
blighter
was
hysterical
he
began
to
stagger
about
all
over
the
floor
he
right
the
man
absolutely
right
jeeves
you
a
you
hit
on
the
greatest
idea
of
the
age
report
at
the
office
on
monday
start
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
i
buy
the
business
if
i
feel
like
it
i
know
the
man
who
runs
the
comic
section
of
the
he
eat
this
thing
he
was
telling
me
only
the
other
day
how
hard
it
was
to
get
a
good
new
series
he
give
me
anything
i
ask
for
a
real
winner
like
this
i
got
a
where
my
hat
i
got
an
income
for
life
where
that
confounded
hat
lend
me
a
fiver
bertie
i
want
to
take
a
taxi
down
to
park
row
jeeves
smiled
paternally
or
rather
he
had
a
kind
of
paternal
muscular
spasm
about
the
mouth
which
is
the
nearest
he
ever
gets
to
smiling
if
i
might
make
the
suggestion
corcoran
for
a
title
of
the
series
which
you
have
in
mind
adventures
of
baby
blobbs
corky
and
i
looked
at
the
picture
then
at
each
other
in
an
awed
way
jeeves
was
right
there
could
be
no
other
title
jeeves
i
said
it
was
a
few
weeks
later
and
i
had
just
finished
looking
at
the
comic
section
of
the
i
an
optimist
i
always
have
been
the
older
i
get
the
more
i
agree
with
shakespeare
and
those
poet
johnnies
about
it
always
being
darkest
before
the
dawn
and
there
a
silver
lining
and
what
you
lose
on
the
swings
you
make
up
on
the
roundabouts
look
at
corcoran
for
instance
there
was
a
fellow
one
would
have
said
clear
up
to
the
eyebrows
in
the
soup
to
all
appearances
he
had
got
it
right
in
the
neck
yet
look
at
him
now
have
you
seen
these
pictures
i
took
the
liberty
of
glancing
at
them
before
bringing
them
to
you
sir
extremely
diverting
they
have
made
a
big
hit
you
know
i
anticipated
it
sir
i
leaned
back
against
the
pillows
you
know
jeeves
you
a
genius
you
ought
to
be
drawing
a
commission
on
these
things
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
in
that
respect
sir
corcoran
has
been
most
generous
i
am
putting
out
the
brown
suit
sir
no
i
think
i
wear
the
blue
with
the
faint
red
stripe
not
the
blue
with
the
faint
red
stripe
sir
but
i
rather
fancy
myself
in
it
not
the
blue
with
the
faint
red
stripe
sir
oh
all
right
have
it
your
own
way
very
good
sir
thank
you
sir
of
course
i
know
it
as
bad
as
being
henpecked
but
then
jeeves
is
always
right
you
got
to
consider
that
you
know
what
jeeves
and
the
unbidden
guest
i
not
absolutely
certain
of
my
facts
but
i
rather
fancy
shakespeare
or
if
not
it
some
equally
brainy
lad
who
says
that
it
always
just
when
a
chappie
is
feeling
particularly
and
more
than
usually
braced
with
things
in
general
that
fate
sneaks
up
behind
him
with
a
bit
of
lead
piping
there
no
doubt
the
man
right
it
absolutely
that
way
with
me
take
for
instance
the
fairly
rummy
matter
of
lady
malvern
and
her
son
wilmot
a
moment
before
they
turned
up
i
was
just
thinking
how
thoroughly
all
right
everything
was
it
was
one
of
those
topping
mornings
and
i
had
just
climbed
out
from
under
the
cold
shower
feeling
like
a
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
especially
bucked
just
then
because
the
day
before
i
had
asserted
myself
with
jeeves
absolutely
asserted
myself
do
you
know
you
see
the
way
things
had
been
going
on
i
was
rapidly
becoming
a
dashed
serf
the
man
had
jolly
well
oppressed
me
i
did
so
much
mind
when
he
made
me
give
up
one
of
my
new
suits
because
judgment
about
suits
is
sound
but
i
as
near
as
a
toucher
rebelled
when
he
would
let
me
wear
a
pair
of
boots
which
i
loved
like
a
couple
of
brothers
and
when
he
tried
to
tread
on
me
like
a
worm
in
the
matter
of
a
hat
i
jolly
well
put
my
foot
down
and
showed
him
who
was
who
it
a
long
story
and
i
have
time
to
tell
you
now
but
the
point
is
that
he
wanted
me
to
wear
the
longacre
as
worn
by
john
drew
when
i
had
set
my
heart
on
the
country
gentleman
as
worn
by
another
famous
actor
chappie
and
the
end
of
the
matter
was
that
after
a
rather
painful
scene
i
bought
the
country
gentleman
so
that
how
things
stood
on
this
particular
morning
and
i
was
feeling
kind
of
manly
and
independent
well
i
was
in
the
bathroom
wondering
what
there
was
going
to
be
for
breakfast
while
i
massaged
the
good
old
spine
with
a
rough
towel
and
sang
slightly
when
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
i
stopped
singing
and
opened
the
door
an
inch
what
ho
without
there
lady
malvern
wishes
to
see
you
sir
said
jeeves
eh
lady
malvern
sir
she
is
waiting
in
the
pull
yourself
together
jeeves
my
man
i
said
rather
severely
for
i
bar
practical
jokes
before
breakfast
you
know
perfectly
well
there
no
one
waiting
for
me
in
the
how
could
there
be
when
it
barely
ten
yet
i
gathered
from
her
ladyship
sir
that
she
had
landed
from
an
ocean
liner
at
an
early
hour
this
morning
this
made
the
thing
a
bit
more
plausible
i
remembered
that
when
i
had
arrived
in
america
about
a
year
before
the
proceedings
had
begun
at
some
ghastly
hour
like
six
and
that
i
had
been
shot
out
on
to
a
foreign
shore
considerably
before
eight
who
the
deuce
is
lady
malvern
jeeves
her
ladyship
did
not
confide
in
me
sir
is
she
alone
her
ladyship
is
accompanied
by
a
lord
pershore
sir
i
fancy
that
his
lordship
would
be
her
ladyship
son
oh
well
put
out
rich
raiment
of
sorts
and
i
be
dressing
our
lounge
is
in
readiness
sir
then
lead
me
to
it
while
i
was
dressing
i
kept
trying
to
think
who
on
earth
lady
malvern
could
be
it
was
till
i
had
climbed
through
the
top
of
my
shirt
and
was
reaching
out
for
the
studs
that
i
remembered
i
placed
her
jeeves
she
a
pal
of
my
aunt
agatha
indeed
sir
yes
i
met
her
at
lunch
one
sunday
before
i
left
london
a
very
vicious
specimen
writes
books
she
wrote
a
book
on
social
conditions
in
india
when
she
came
back
from
the
durbar
yes
sir
pardon
me
sir
but
not
that
tie
eh
not
that
tie
with
the
lounge
sir
it
was
a
shock
to
me
i
thought
i
had
quelled
the
fellow
it
was
rather
a
solemn
moment
what
i
mean
is
if
i
weakened
now
all
my
good
work
the
night
before
would
be
thrown
away
i
braced
myself
what
wrong
with
this
tie
i
seen
you
give
it
a
nasty
look
before
speak
out
like
a
man
what
the
matter
with
it
too
ornate
sir
nonsense
a
cheerful
pink
nothing
more
unsuitable
sir
jeeves
this
is
the
tie
i
wear
very
good
sir
dashed
unpleasant
i
could
see
that
the
man
was
wounded
but
i
was
firm
i
tied
the
tie
got
into
the
coat
and
waistcoat
and
went
into
the
halloa
halloa
halloa
i
said
what
ah
how
do
you
do
wooster
you
have
never
met
my
son
wilmot
i
think
motty
darling
this
is
mr
wooster
lady
malvern
was
a
hearty
happy
healthy
overpowering
sort
of
dashed
female
not
so
very
tall
but
making
up
for
it
by
measuring
about
six
feet
from
the
to
the
prompt
side
she
fitted
into
my
biggest
as
if
it
had
been
built
round
her
by
someone
who
knew
they
were
wearing
tight
about
the
hips
that
season
she
had
bright
bulging
eyes
and
a
lot
of
yellow
hair
and
when
she
spoke
she
showed
about
front
teeth
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
kind
of
numb
a
fellow
faculties
she
made
me
feel
as
if
i
were
ten
years
old
and
had
been
brought
into
the
in
my
sunday
clothes
to
say
altogether
by
no
means
the
sort
of
thing
a
chappie
would
wish
to
find
in
his
before
breakfast
motty
the
son
was
about
tall
and
thin
and
he
had
the
same
yellow
hair
as
his
mother
but
he
wore
it
plastered
down
and
parted
in
the
middle
his
eyes
bulged
too
but
they
bright
they
were
a
dull
grey
with
pink
rims
his
chin
gave
up
the
struggle
about
down
and
he
did
appear
to
have
any
eyelashes
a
mild
furtive
sheepish
sort
of
blighter
in
short
awfully
glad
to
see
you
i
said
so
you
popped
over
eh
making
a
long
stay
in
america
about
a
month
your
aunt
gave
me
your
address
and
told
me
to
be
sure
and
call
on
you
i
was
glad
to
hear
this
as
it
showed
that
aunt
agatha
was
beginning
to
come
round
a
bit
there
had
been
some
unpleasantness
a
year
before
when
she
had
sent
me
over
to
new
york
to
disentangle
my
cousin
gussie
from
the
clutches
of
a
girl
on
the
stage
when
i
tell
you
that
by
the
time
i
had
finished
my
operations
gussie
had
not
only
married
the
girl
but
had
gone
on
the
stage
himself
and
was
doing
well
you
understand
that
aunt
agatha
was
upset
to
no
small
extent
i
simply
had
dared
go
back
and
face
her
and
it
was
a
relief
to
find
that
time
had
healed
the
wound
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
enough
to
make
her
tell
her
pals
to
look
me
up
what
i
mean
is
much
as
i
liked
america
i
did
want
to
have
england
barred
to
me
for
the
rest
of
my
natural
and
believe
me
england
is
a
jolly
sight
too
small
for
anyone
to
live
in
with
aunt
agatha
if
she
really
on
the
warpath
so
i
braced
on
hearing
these
kind
words
and
smiled
genially
on
the
assemblage
your
aunt
said
that
you
would
do
anything
that
was
in
your
power
to
be
of
assistance
to
us
rather
oh
rather
absolutely
thank
you
so
much
i
want
you
to
put
dear
motty
up
for
a
little
while
i
did
get
this
for
a
moment
put
him
up
for
my
clubs
no
no
darling
motty
is
essentially
a
home
bird
are
you
motty
darling
motty
who
was
sucking
the
knob
of
his
stick
uncorked
himself
yes
mother
he
said
and
corked
himself
up
again
i
should
not
like
him
to
belong
to
clubs
i
mean
put
him
up
here
have
him
to
live
with
you
while
i
am
away
these
frightful
words
trickled
out
of
her
like
honey
the
woman
simply
did
seem
to
understand
the
ghastly
nature
of
her
proposal
i
gave
motty
the
swift
he
was
sitting
with
his
mouth
nuzzling
the
stick
blinking
at
the
wall
the
thought
of
having
this
planted
on
me
for
an
indefinite
period
appalled
me
absolutely
appalled
me
you
know
i
was
just
starting
to
say
that
the
shot
was
on
the
board
at
any
price
and
that
the
first
sign
motty
gave
of
trying
to
nestle
into
my
little
home
i
would
yell
for
the
police
when
she
went
on
rolling
placidly
over
me
as
it
were
there
was
something
about
this
woman
that
sapped
a
chappie
i
am
leaving
new
york
by
the
midday
train
as
i
have
to
pay
a
visit
to
prison

am
extremely
interested
in
prison
conditions
in
america

that
i
work
my
way
gradually
across
to
the
coast
visiting
the
points
of
interest
on
the
journey

wooster

am
in
america

on
business

my

companion
volume

not
be
able
to
spend
more
than
a
month
in
the
country
as
i
have
to
get
back

the
season
but
a
month
should
be
ample
i
was
less
than
a
month
in
india
and
my
dear
friend
sir
roger
cremorne
wrote
his
from
after
a
stay
of
only
two
weeks

the
poor

so
sick
when
he
travels
by
train
i
shall
have
to
pick
him
up
on
my
return
from
where
i
sat
i
could
see
jeeves
in
the
laying
the
i
wished
i
could
have
had
a
minute
with
him
alone
i
felt
certain
that
he
would
have
been
able
to
think
of
some
way
of
putting
a
stop
to
this
woman
it
will
be
such
a
relief
to
know
that
motty
is
safe
with
you
wooster
i
know
what
the
temptations
of
a
great
city
are
hitherto
dear
motty
has
been
sheltered
from
them
he
has
lived
quietly
with
me
in
the
country
i
know
that
you
will
look
after
him
carefully
wooster
he
will
give
very
little
trouble
she
talked
about
the
poor
blighter
as
if
he
was
there
not
that
motty
seemed
to
mind
he
had
stopped
chewing
his
and
was
sitting
there
with
his
mouth
open
he
is
a
vegetarian
and
a
teetotaller
and
is
devoted
to
reading
give
him
a
nice
book
and
he
will
be
quite
contented
she
got
up
thank
you
so
much
wooster
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
your
help
come
motty
we
have
just
time
to
see
a
few
of
the
sights
before
my
train
goes
but
i
shall
have
to
rely
on
you
for
most
of
my
information
about
new
york
darling
be
sure
to
keep
your
eyes
open
and
take
notes
of
your
impressions
it
will
be
such
a
help
wooster
i
will
send
motty
back
early
in
the
afternoon
they
went
out
and
i
howled
for
jeeves
jeeves
what
about
it
sir
what
to
be
done
you
heard
it
all
did
you
you
were
in
the
most
of
the
time
that
pill
is
coming
to
stay
here
pill
sir
the
excrescence
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
looked
at
jeeves
sharply
this
sort
of
thing
was
like
him
it
was
as
if
he
were
deliberately
trying
to
give
me
the
pip
then
i
understood
the
man
was
really
upset
about
that
tie
he
was
trying
to
get
his
own
back
lord
pershore
will
be
staying
here
from
jeeves
i
said
coldly
very
good
sir
breakfast
is
ready
sir
i
could
have
sobbed
into
the
bacon
and
eggs
that
there
was
any
sympathy
to
be
got
out
of
jeeves
was
what
put
the
lid
on
it
for
a
moment
i
almost
weakened
and
told
him
to
destroy
the
hat
and
tie
if
he
did
like
them
but
i
pulled
myself
together
again
i
was
dashed
if
i
was
going
to
let
jeeves
treat
me
like
a
bally
but
what
with
brooding
on
jeeves
and
brooding
on
motty
i
was
in
a
pretty
reduced
sort
of
state
the
more
i
examined
the
situation
the
more
blighted
it
became
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
if
i
slung
motty
out
he
would
report
to
his
mother
and
she
would
pass
it
on
to
aunt
agatha
and
i
did
like
to
think
what
would
happen
then
sooner
or
later
i
should
be
wanting
to
go
back
to
england
and
i
did
want
to
get
there
and
find
aunt
agatha
waiting
on
the
quay
for
me
with
a
stuffed
eelskin
there
was
absolutely
nothing
for
it
but
to
put
the
fellow
up
and
make
the
best
of
it
about
midday
motty
luggage
arrived
and
soon
afterward
a
large
parcel
of
what
i
took
to
be
nice
books
i
brightened
up
a
little
when
i
saw
it
it
was
one
of
those
massive
parcels
and
looked
as
if
it
had
enough
in
it
to
keep
the
chappie
busy
for
a
year
i
felt
a
trifle
more
cheerful
and
i
got
my
country
gentleman
hat
and
stuck
it
on
my
head
and
gave
the
pink
tie
a
twist
and
reeled
out
to
take
a
bite
of
lunch
with
one
or
two
of
the
lads
at
a
neighbouring
hostelry
and
what
with
excellent
browsing
and
sluicing
and
cheery
conversation
and
the
afternoon
passed
quite
happily
by
i
had
almost
forgotten
blighted
motty
existence
i
dined
at
the
club
and
looked
in
at
a
show
afterward
and
it
till
fairly
late
that
i
got
back
to
the
flat
there
were
no
signs
of
motty
and
i
took
it
that
he
had
gone
to
bed
it
seemed
rummy
to
me
though
that
the
parcel
of
nice
books
was
still
there
with
the
string
and
paper
on
it
it
looked
as
if
motty
after
seeing
mother
off
at
the
station
had
decided
to
call
it
a
day
jeeves
came
in
with
the
nightly
i
could
tell
by
the
chappie
manner
that
he
was
still
upset
lord
pershore
gone
to
bed
jeeves
i
asked
with
reserved
hauteur
and
no
sir
his
lordship
has
not
yet
returned
not
returned
what
do
you
mean
his
lordship
came
in
shortly
after
and
having
dressed
went
out
again
at
this
moment
there
was
a
noise
outside
the
front
door
a
sort
of
scrabbling
noise
as
if
somebody
were
trying
to
paw
his
way
through
the
woodwork
then
a
sort
of
thud
better
go
and
see
what
that
is
jeeves
very
good
sir
he
went
out
and
came
back
again
if
you
would
not
mind
stepping
this
way
sir
i
think
we
might
be
able
to
carry
him
in
carry
him
in
his
lordship
is
lying
on
the
mat
sir
i
went
to
the
front
door
the
man
was
right
there
was
motty
huddled
up
outside
on
the
floor
he
was
moaning
a
bit
he
had
some
sort
of
dashed
fit
i
said
i
took
another
look
jeeves
someone
been
feeding
him
meat
sir
he
a
vegetarian
you
know
he
must
have
been
digging
into
a
steak
or
something
call
up
a
doctor
i
hardly
think
it
will
be
necessary
sir
if
you
would
take
his
lordship
legs
while
i
great
scot
jeeves
you
do
think
he
ca
be
i
am
inclined
to
think
so
sir
and
by
jove
he
was
right
once
on
the
right
track
you
mistake
it
motty
was
under
the
surface
it
was
the
deuce
of
a
shock
you
never
can
tell
jeeves
very
seldom
sir
remove
the
eye
of
authority
and
where
are
you
precisely
sir
where
is
my
wandering
boy
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
what
it
would
seem
so
sir
well
we
had
better
bring
him
in
eh
yes
sir
so
we
lugged
him
in
and
jeeves
put
him
to
bed
and
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
sat
down
to
think
the
thing
over
i
had
a
kind
of
foreboding
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
let
myself
in
for
something
pretty
rocky
next
morning
after
i
had
sucked
down
a
thoughtful
cup
of
tea
i
went
into
motty
room
to
investigate
i
expected
to
find
the
fellow
a
wreck
but
there
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
quite
chirpy
reading
gingery
stories
what
ho
i
said
what
ho
said
motty
what
ho
what
ho
what
ho
what
ho
what
ho
after
that
it
seemed
rather
difficult
to
go
on
with
the
conversation
how
are
you
feeling
this
morning
i
asked
topping
replied
motty
blithely
and
with
abandon
i
say
you
know
that
fellow
of
yours
jeeves
you
know
is
a
corker
i
had
a
most
frightful
headache
when
i
woke
up
and
he
brought
me
a
sort
of
rummy
dark
drink
and
it
put
me
right
again
at
once
said
it
was
his
own
invention
i
must
see
more
of
that
lad
he
seems
to
me
distinctly
one
of
the
ones
i
could
believe
that
this
was
the
same
blighter
who
had
sat
and
sucked
his
stick
the
day
before
you
ate
something
that
disagreed
with
you
last
night
did
you
i
said
by
way
of
giving
him
a
chance
to
slide
out
of
it
if
he
wanted
to
but
he
would
have
it
at
any
price
no
he
replied
firmly
i
did
do
anything
of
the
kind
i
drank
too
much
much
too
much
lots
and
lots
too
much
and
what
more
going
to
do
it
again
i
going
to
do
it
every
night
if
ever
you
see
me
sober
old
top
he
said
with
a
kind
of
holy
exaltation
tap
me
on
the
shoulder
and
say
tut
and
i
apologize
and
remedy
the
defect
but
i
say
you
know
what
about
me
what
about
you
well
i
so
to
speak
as
it
were
kind
of
responsible
for
you
what
i
mean
to
say
is
if
you
go
doing
this
sort
of
thing
i
apt
to
get
in
the
soup
somewhat
i
ca
help
your
troubles
said
motty
firmly
listen
to
me
old
thing
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
a
real
chance
to
yield
to
the
temptations
of
a
great
city
what
the
use
of
a
great
city
having
temptations
if
fellows
do
yield
to
them
makes
it
so
bally
discouraging
for
a
great
city
besides
mother
told
me
to
keep
my
eyes
open
and
collect
impressions
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
i
felt
dizzy
i
know
just
how
you
feel
old
dear
said
motty
consolingly
and
if
my
principles
would
permit
it
i
would
simmer
down
for
your
sake
but
duty
first
this
is
the
first
time
i
been
let
out
alone
and
i
mean
to
make
the
most
of
it
we
only
young
once
why
interfere
with
life
morning
young
man
rejoice
in
thy
youth
what
ho
put
like
that
it
did
seem
reasonable
all
my
bally
life
dear
boy
motty
went
on
i
been
cooped
up
in
the
ancestral
home
at
much
middlefold
in
shropshire
and
till
been
cooped
up
in
much
middlefold
you
do
know
what
cooping
is
the
only
time
we
get
any
excitement
is
when
one
of
the
is
caught
sucking
chocolate
during
the
sermon
when
that
happens
we
talk
about
it
for
days
i
got
about
a
month
of
new
york
and
i
mean
to
store
up
a
few
happy
memories
for
the
long
winter
evenings
this
is
my
only
chance
to
collect
a
past
and
i
going
to
do
it
now
tell
me
old
sport
as
man
to
man
how
does
one
get
in
touch
with
that
very
decent
chappie
jeeves
does
one
ring
a
bell
or
shout
a
bit
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
subject
of
a
good
stiff
with
him
i
had
had
a
sort
of
vague
idea
do
you
know
that
if
i
stuck
close
to
motty
and
went
about
the
place
with
him
i
might
act
as
a
bit
of
a
damper
on
the
gaiety
what
i
mean
is
i
thought
that
if
when
he
was
being
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
he
were
to
catch
my
reproving
eye
he
might
ease
up
a
trifle
on
the
revelry
so
the
next
night
i
took
him
along
to
supper
with
me
it
was
the
last
time
i
a
quiet
peaceful
sort
of
chappie
who
has
lived
all
his
life
in
london
and
i
ca
stand
the
pace
these
swift
sportsmen
from
the
rural
districts
set
what
i
mean
to
say
is
this
i
all
for
rational
enjoyment
and
so
forth
but
i
think
a
chappie
makes
himself
conspicuous
when
he
throws
eggs
at
the
electric
fan
and
decent
mirth
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
are
all
right
but
i
do
bar
dancing
on
tables
and
having
to
dash
all
over
the
place
dodging
waiters
managers
and
just
when
you
want
to
sit
still
and
digest
directly
i
managed
to
tear
myself
away
that
night
and
get
home
i
made
up
my
mind
that
this
was
jolly
well
the
last
time
that
i
went
about
with
motty
the
only
time
i
met
him
late
at
night
after
that
was
once
when
i
passed
the
door
of
a
fairly
sort
of
restaurant
and
had
to
step
aside
to
dodge
him
as
he
sailed
through
the
air
for
the
opposite
pavement
with
a
muscular
sort
of
looking
chappie
peering
out
after
him
with
a
kind
of
gloomy
satisfaction
in
a
way
i
could
help
sympathizing
with
the
fellow
he
had
about
four
weeks
to
have
the
good
time
that
ought
to
have
been
spread
over
about
ten
years
and
i
did
wonder
at
his
wanting
to
be
pretty
busy
i
should
have
been
just
the
same
in
his
place
still
there
was
no
denying
that
it
was
a
bit
thick
if
it
had
been
for
the
thought
of
lady
malvern
and
aunt
agatha
in
the
background
i
should
have
regarded
motty
rapid
work
with
an
indulgent
smile
but
i
could
get
rid
of
the
feeling
that
sooner
or
later
i
was
the
lad
who
was
scheduled
to
get
it
behind
the
ear
and
what
with
brooding
on
this
prospect
and
sitting
up
in
the
old
flat
waiting
for
the
familiar
footstep
and
putting
it
to
bed
when
it
got
there
and
stealing
into
the
next
morning
to
contemplate
the
wreckage
i
was
beginning
to
lose
weight
absolutely
becoming
the
good
old
shadow
i
give
you
my
honest
word
starting
at
sudden
noises
and
and
no
sympathy
from
jeeves
that
was
what
cut
me
to
the
quick
the
man
was
still
thoroughly
pipped
about
the
hat
and
tie
and
simply
rally
round
one
morning
i
wanted
comforting
so
much
that
i
sank
the
pride
of
the
woosters
and
appealed
to
the
fellow
direct
jeeves
i
said
this
is
getting
a
bit
thick
sir
business
and
cold
respectfulness
you
know
what
i
mean
this
lad
seems
to
have
chucked
all
the
principles
of
a
boyhood
he
has
got
it
up
his
nose
yes
sir
well
i
shall
get
blamed
do
you
know
you
know
what
my
aunt
agatha
is
yes
sir
very
well
then
i
waited
a
moment
but
he
would
unbend
jeeves
i
said
have
you
any
scheme
up
your
sleeve
for
coping
with
this
blighter
no
sir
and
he
shimmered
off
to
his
lair
obstinate
devil
so
dashed
absurd
do
you
know
it
was
as
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
that
country
gentleman
hat
it
was
a
remarkably
priceless
effort
and
much
admired
by
the
lads
but
just
because
he
preferred
the
longacre
he
left
me
flat
it
was
shortly
after
this
that
young
motty
got
the
idea
of
bringing
pals
back
in
the
small
hours
to
continue
the
gay
revels
in
the
home
this
was
where
i
began
to
crack
under
the
strain
you
see
the
part
of
town
where
i
was
living
was
the
right
place
for
that
sort
of
thing
i
knew
lots
of
chappies
down
washington
square
way
who
started
the
evening
at
about
artists
and
writers
and
who
frolicked
considerably
till
checked
by
the
arrival
of
the
morning
milk
that
was
all
right
they
like
that
sort
of
thing
down
there
the
neighbours
ca
get
to
sleep
unless
there
someone
dancing
hawaiian
dances
over
their
heads
but
on
street
the
atmosphere
was
right
and
when
motty
turned
up
at
three
in
the
morning
with
a
collection
of
hearty
lads
who
only
stopped
singing
their
college
song
when
they
started
singing
the
old
oaken
bucket
there
was
a
marked
peevishness
among
the
old
settlers
in
the
flats
the
management
was
extremely
terse
over
the
telephone
at
and
took
a
lot
of
soothing
the
next
night
i
came
home
early
after
a
lonely
dinner
at
a
place
which
i
chosen
because
there
did
seem
any
chance
of
meeting
motty
there
the
was
quite
dark
and
i
was
just
moving
to
switch
on
the
light
when
there
was
a
sort
of
explosion
and
something
collared
hold
of
my
living
with
motty
had
reduced
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
was
simply
unable
to
cope
with
this
thing
i
jumped
backward
with
a
loud
yell
of
anguish
and
tumbled
out
into
the
hall
just
as
jeeves
came
out
of
his
den
to
see
what
the
matter
was
did
you
call
sir
jeeves
there
something
in
there
that
grabs
you
by
the
leg
that
would
be
rollo
sir
eh
i
would
have
warned
you
of
his
presence
but
i
did
not
hear
you
come
in
his
temper
is
a
little
uncertain
at
present
as
he
has
not
yet
settled
down
who
the
deuce
is
rollo
his
lordship
sir
his
lordship
won
him
in
a
raffle
and
tied
him
to
the
leg
of
the
table
if
you
will
allow
me
sir
i
will
go
in
and
switch
on
the
light
there
really
is
nobody
like
jeeves
he
walked
straight
into
the
the
biggest
feat
since
daniel
and
the
lions
den
without
a
quiver
what
more
his
magnetism
or
whatever
they
call
it
was
such
that
the
dashed
animal
instead
of
pinning
him
by
the
leg
calmed
down
as
if
he
had
had
a
bromide
and
rolled
over
on
his
back
with
all
his
paws
in
the
air
if
jeeves
had
been
his
rich
uncle
he
could
have
been
more
chummy
yet
directly
he
caught
sight
of
me
again
he
got
all
worked
up
and
seemed
to
have
only
one
idea
in
life
to
start
chewing
me
where
he
had
left
off
rollo
is
not
used
to
you
yet
sir
said
jeeves
regarding
the
bally
quadruped
in
an
admiring
sort
of
way
he
is
an
excellent
watchdog
i
do
want
a
watchdog
to
keep
me
out
of
my
rooms
no
sir
well
what
am
i
to
do
no
doubt
in
time
the
animal
will
learn
to
discriminate
sir
he
will
learn
to
distinguish
your
peculiar
scent
what
do
you
mean
my
peculiar
scent
correct
the
impression
that
i
intend
to
hang
about
in
the
hall
while
life
slips
by
in
the
hope
that
one
of
these
days
that
dashed
animal
will
decide
that
i
smell
all
right
i
thought
for
a
bit
jeeves
sir
i
going
away
morning
by
the
first
train
i
shall
go
and
stop
with
todd
in
the
country
do
you
wish
me
to
accompany
you
sir
no
very
good
sir
i
do
know
when
i
shall
be
back
forward
my
letters
yes
sir
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
back
within
the
week
rocky
todd
the
pal
i
went
to
stay
with
is
a
rummy
sort
of
a
chap
who
lives
all
alone
in
the
wilds
of
long
island
and
likes
it
but
a
little
of
that
sort
of
thing
goes
a
long
way
with
me
dear
old
rocky
is
one
of
the
best
but
after
a
few
days
in
his
cottage
in
the
woods
miles
away
from
anywhere
new
york
even
with
motty
on
the
premises
began
to
look
pretty
good
to
me
the
days
down
on
long
island
have
hours
in
them
you
get
to
sleep
at
night
because
of
the
bellowing
of
the
crickets
and
you
have
to
walk
two
miles
for
a
drink
and
six
for
an
evening
paper
i
thanked
rocky
for
his
kind
hospitality
and
caught
the
only
train
they
have
down
in
those
parts
it
landed
me
in
new
york
about
i
went
straight
to
the
old
flat
jeeves
came
out
of
his
lair
i
looked
round
cautiously
for
rollo
where
that
dog
jeeves
have
you
got
him
tied
up
the
animal
is
no
longer
here
sir
his
lordship
gave
him
to
the
porter
who
sold
him
his
lordship
took
a
prejudice
against
the
animal
on
account
of
being
bitten
by
him
in
the
calf
of
the
leg
i
do
think
i
ever
been
so
bucked
by
a
bit
of
news
i
felt
i
had
misjudged
rollo
evidently
when
you
got
to
know
him
better
he
had
a
lot
of
intelligence
in
him
ripping
i
said
is
lord
pershore
in
jeeves
no
sir
do
you
expect
him
back
to
dinner
no
sir
where
is
he
in
prison
sir
have
you
ever
trodden
on
a
rake
and
had
the
handle
jump
up
and
hit
you
that
how
i
felt
then
in
prison
yes
sir
you
do
mean
in
prison
yes
sir
i
lowered
myself
into
a
chair
why
i
said
he
assaulted
a
constable
sir
lord
pershore
assaulted
a
constable
yes
sir
i
digested
this
but
jeeves
i
say
this
is
frightful
sir
what
will
lady
malvern
say
when
she
finds
out
i
do
not
fancy
that
her
ladyship
will
find
out
sir
but
she
come
back
and
want
to
know
where
he
is
i
rather
fancy
sir
that
his
lordship
bit
of
time
will
have
run
out
by
then
but
supposing
it
has
in
that
event
sir
it
may
be
judicious
to
prevaricate
a
little
how
if
i
might
make
the
suggestion
sir
i
should
inform
her
ladyship
that
his
lordship
has
left
for
a
short
visit
to
boston
why
boston
very
interesting
and
respectable
centre
sir
jeeves
i
believe
you
hit
it
i
fancy
so
sir
why
this
is
really
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
if
this
had
turned
up
to
prevent
him
young
motty
would
have
been
in
a
sanatorium
by
the
time
lady
malvern
got
back
exactly
sir
the
more
i
looked
at
it
in
that
way
the
sounder
this
prison
wheeze
seemed
to
me
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
world
that
prison
was
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
for
motty
it
was
the
only
thing
that
could
have
pulled
him
up
i
was
sorry
for
the
poor
blighter
but
after
all
i
reflected
a
chappie
who
had
lived
all
his
life
with
lady
malvern
in
a
small
village
in
the
interior
of
shropshire
would
have
much
to
kick
at
in
a
prison
altogether
i
began
to
feel
absolutely
braced
again
life
became
like
what
the
poet
johnnie
says
one
grand
sweet
song
things
went
on
so
comfortably
and
peacefully
for
a
couple
of
weeks
that
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
almost
forgotten
such
a
person
as
motty
existed
the
only
flaw
in
the
scheme
of
things
was
that
jeeves
was
still
pained
and
distant
it
was
anything
he
said
or
did
mind
you
but
there
was
a
rummy
something
about
him
all
the
time
once
when
i
was
tying
the
pink
tie
i
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
there
was
a
kind
of
grieved
look
in
his
eye
and
then
lady
malvern
came
back
a
good
bit
ahead
of
schedule
i
been
expecting
her
for
days
i
forgotten
how
time
had
been
slipping
along
she
turned
up
one
morning
while
i
was
still
in
bed
sipping
tea
and
thinking
of
this
and
that
jeeves
flowed
in
with
the
announcement
that
he
had
just
loosed
her
into
the
i
draped
a
few
garments
round
me
and
went
in
there
she
was
sitting
in
the
same
looking
as
massive
as
ever
the
only
difference
was
that
she
did
uncover
the
teeth
as
she
had
done
the
first
time
good
morning
i
said
so
you
got
back
what
i
have
got
back
there
was
something
sort
of
bleak
about
her
tone
rather
as
if
she
had
swallowed
an
east
wind
this
i
took
to
be
due
to
the
fact
that
she
probably
had
breakfasted
it
only
after
a
bit
of
breakfast
that
i
able
to
regard
the
world
with
that
sunny
cheeriness
which
makes
a
fellow
the
universal
favourite
i
never
much
of
a
lad
till
engulfed
an
egg
or
two
and
a
beaker
of
coffee
i
suppose
you
have
breakfasted
i
have
not
yet
breakfasted
wo
you
have
an
egg
or
something
or
a
sausage
or
something
or
something
no
thank
you
she
spoke
as
if
she
belonged
to
an
society
or
a
league
for
the
suppression
of
eggs
there
was
a
bit
of
a
silence
i
called
on
you
last
night
she
said
but
you
were
out
awfully
sorry
had
a
pleasant
trip
extremely
thank
you
see
everything
falls
yellowstone
park
and
the
jolly
old
grand
canyon
and
i
saw
a
great
deal
there
was
another
slightly
silence
jeeves
floated
silently
into
the
and
began
to
lay
the
i
hope
wilmot
was
not
in
your
way
mr
wooster
i
had
been
wondering
when
she
was
going
to
mention
motty
rather
not
great
pals
hit
it
off
splendidly
you
were
his
constant
companion
then
absolutely
we
were
always
together
saw
all
the
sights
do
you
know
we
take
in
the
museum
of
art
in
the
morning
and
have
a
bit
of
lunch
at
some
good
vegetarian
place
and
then
toddle
along
to
a
sacred
concert
in
the
afternoon
and
home
to
an
early
dinner
we
usually
played
dominoes
after
dinner
and
then
the
early
bed
and
the
refreshing
sleep
we
had
a
great
time
i
was
awfully
sorry
when
he
went
away
to
boston
oh
wilmot
is
in
boston
yes
i
ought
to
have
let
you
know
but
of
course
we
did
know
where
you
were
you
were
dodging
all
over
the
place
like
a
snipe
i
mean
do
you
know
dodging
all
over
the
place
and
we
could
get
at
you
yes
motty
went
off
to
boston
you
sure
he
went
to
boston
oh
absolutely
i
called
out
to
jeeves
who
was
now
messing
about
in
the
next
room
with
forks
and
so
forth
jeeves
lord
pershore
change
his
mind
about
going
to
boston
did
he
no
sir
i
thought
i
was
right
yes
motty
went
to
boston
then
how
do
you
account
wooster
for
the
fact
that
when
i
went
yesterday
afternoon
to
blackwell
island
prison
to
secure
material
for
my
book
i
saw
poor
dear
wilmot
there
dressed
in
a
striped
suit
seated
beside
a
pile
of
stones
with
a
hammer
in
his
hands
i
tried
to
think
of
something
to
say
but
nothing
came
a
chappie
has
to
be
a
lot
broader
about
the
forehead
than
i
am
to
handle
a
jolt
like
this
i
strained
the
old
bean
till
it
creaked
but
between
the
collar
and
the
hair
parting
nothing
stirred
i
was
dumb
which
was
lucky
because
i
would
have
had
a
chance
to
get
any
persiflage
out
of
my
system
lady
malvern
collared
the
conversation
she
had
been
bottling
it
up
and
now
it
came
out
with
a
rush
so
this
is
how
you
have
looked
after
my
poor
dear
boy
wooster
so
this
is
how
you
have
abused
my
trust
i
left
him
in
your
charge
thinking
that
i
could
rely
on
you
to
shield
him
from
evil
he
came
to
you
innocent
unversed
in
the
ways
of
the
world
confiding
unused
to
the
temptations
of
a
large
city
and
you
led
him
astray
i
had
any
remarks
to
make
all
i
could
think
of
was
the
picture
of
aunt
agatha
drinking
all
this
in
and
reaching
out
to
sharpen
the
hatchet
against
my
return
you
deliberately
far
away
in
the
misty
distance
a
soft
voice
spoke
if
i
might
explain
your
ladyship
jeeves
had
projected
himself
in
from
the
and
materialized
on
the
rug
lady
malvern
tried
to
freeze
him
with
a
look
but
you
do
that
sort
of
thing
to
jeeves
he
is
i
fancy
your
ladyship
that
you
have
misunderstood
wooster
and
that
he
may
have
given
you
the
impression
that
he
was
in
new
york
when
his
lordship
was
removed
when
wooster
informed
your
ladyship
that
his
lordship
had
gone
to
boston
he
was
relying
on
the
version
i
had
given
him
of
his
lordship
movements
wooster
was
away
visiting
a
friend
in
the
country
at
the
time
and
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
till
your
ladyship
informed
him
lady
malvern
gave
a
kind
of
grunt
it
did
rattle
jeeves
i
feared
wooster
might
be
disturbed
if
he
knew
the
truth
as
he
is
so
attached
to
his
lordship
and
has
taken
such
pains
to
look
after
him
so
i
took
the
liberty
of
telling
him
that
his
lordship
had
gone
away
for
a
visit
it
might
have
been
hard
for
wooster
to
believe
that
his
lordship
had
gone
to
prison
voluntarily
and
from
the
best
motives
but
your
ladyship
knowing
him
better
will
readily
understand
what
lady
malvern
goggled
at
him
did
you
say
that
lord
pershore
went
to
prison
voluntarily
if
i
might
explain
your
ladyship
i
think
that
your
parting
words
made
a
deep
impression
on
his
lordship
i
have
frequently
heard
him
speak
to
wooster
of
his
desire
to
do
something
to
follow
your
ladyship
instructions
and
collect
material
for
your
book
on
america
wooster
will
bear
me
out
when
i
say
that
his
lordship
was
frequently
extremely
depressed
at
the
thought
that
he
was
doing
so
little
to
help
absolutely
by
jove
quite
pipped
about
it
i
said
the
idea
of
making
a
personal
examination
into
the
prison
system
of
the
country
from
within
occurred
to
his
lordship
very
suddenly
one
night
he
embraced
it
eagerly
there
was
no
restraining
him
lady
malvern
looked
at
jeeves
then
at
me
then
at
jeeves
again
i
could
see
her
struggling
with
the
thing
surely
your
ladyship
said
jeeves
it
is
more
reasonable
to
suppose
that
a
gentleman
of
his
lordship
character
went
to
prison
of
his
own
volition
than
that
he
committed
some
breach
of
the
law
which
necessitated
his
arrest
lady
malvern
blinked
then
she
got
up
wooster
she
said
i
apologize
i
have
done
you
an
injustice
i
should
have
known
wilmot
better
i
should
have
had
more
faith
in
his
pure
fine
spirit
absolutely
i
said
your
breakfast
is
ready
sir
said
jeeves
i
sat
down
and
dallied
in
a
dazed
sort
of
way
with
a
poached
egg
jeeves
i
said
you
are
certainly
a
thank
you
sir
nothing
would
have
convinced
my
aunt
agatha
that
i
had
lured
that
blighter
into
riotous
living
i
fancy
you
are
right
sir
i
champed
my
egg
for
a
bit
i
was
most
awfully
moved
do
you
know
by
the
way
jeeves
had
rallied
round
something
seemed
to
tell
me
that
this
was
an
occasion
that
called
for
rich
rewards
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
then
i
made
up
my
mind
jeeves
sir
that
pink
tie
yes
sir
burn
it
thank
you
sir
and
jeeves
yes
sir
take
a
taxi
and
get
me
that
longacre
hat
as
worn
by
john
drew
thank
you
very
much
sir
i
felt
most
awfully
braced
i
felt
as
if
the
clouds
had
rolled
away
and
all
was
as
it
used
to
be
i
felt
like
one
of
those
chappies
in
the
novels
who
calls
off
the
fight
with
his
wife
in
the
last
chapter
and
decides
to
forget
and
forgive
i
felt
i
wanted
to
do
all
sorts
of
other
things
to
show
jeeves
that
i
appreciated
him
jeeves
i
said
it
is
enough
is
there
anything
else
you
would
like
yes
sir
if
i
may
make
the
suggestion
fifty
dollars
fifty
dollars
it
will
enable
me
to
pay
a
debt
of
honour
sir
i
owe
it
to
his
lordship
you
owe
lord
pershore
fifty
dollars
yes
sir
i
happened
to
meet
him
in
the
street
the
night
his
lordship
was
arrested
i
had
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
the
most
suitable
method
of
inducing
him
to
abandon
his
mode
of
living
sir
his
lordship
was
a
little
at
the
time
and
i
fancy
that
he
mistook
me
for
a
friend
of
his
at
any
rate
when
i
took
the
liberty
of
wagering
him
fifty
dollars
that
he
would
not
punch
a
passing
policeman
in
the
eye
he
accepted
the
bet
very
cordially
and
won
it
i
produced
my
and
counted
out
a
hundred
take
this
jeeves
i
said
fifty
is
enough
do
you
know
jeeves
you
well
you
absolutely
stand
alone
i
endeavour
to
give
satisfaction
sir
said
jeeves
jeeves
and
the
egg
sometimes
of
a
morning
as
i
sat
in
bed
sucking
down
the
early
cup
of
tea
and
watched
my
man
jeeves
flitting
about
the
room
and
putting
out
the
raiment
for
the
day
i
wondered
what
the
deuce
i
should
do
if
the
fellow
ever
took
it
into
his
head
to
leave
me
it
not
so
bad
now
i
in
new
york
but
in
london
the
anxiety
was
frightful
there
used
to
be
all
sorts
of
attempts
on
the
part
of
low
blighters
to
sneak
him
away
from
me
young
reggie
foljambe
to
my
certain
knowledge
offered
him
double
what
i
was
giving
him
and
alistair
got
a
valet
who
had
been
known
to
press
his
trousers
sideways
used
to
look
at
him
when
he
came
to
see
me
with
a
kind
of
glittering
hungry
eye
which
disturbed
me
deucedly
bally
pirates
the
thing
you
see
is
that
jeeves
is
so
dashed
competent
you
can
spot
it
even
in
the
way
he
shoves
studs
into
a
shirt
i
rely
on
him
absolutely
in
every
crisis
and
he
never
lets
me
down
and
what
more
he
can
always
be
counted
on
to
extend
himself
on
behalf
of
any
pal
of
mine
who
happens
to
be
to
all
appearances
in
the
bouillon
take
the
rather
rummy
case
for
instance
of
dear
old
bicky
and
his
uncle
the
egg
it
happened
after
i
had
been
in
america
for
a
few
months
i
got
back
to
the
flat
latish
one
night
and
when
jeeves
brought
me
the
final
drink
he
said
bickersteth
called
to
see
you
this
evening
sir
while
you
were
out
oh
i
said
twice
sir
he
appeared
a
trifle
agitated
what
pipped
he
gave
that
impression
sir
i
sipped
the
whisky
i
was
sorry
if
bicky
was
in
trouble
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
rather
glad
to
have
something
i
could
discuss
freely
with
jeeves
just
then
because
things
had
been
a
bit
strained
between
us
for
some
time
and
it
had
been
rather
difficult
to
hit
on
anything
to
talk
about
that
was
apt
to
take
a
personal
turn
you
see
i
had
decided
rightly
or
wrongly
to
grow
a
moustache
and
this
had
cut
jeeves
to
the
quick
he
could
stick
the
thing
at
any
price
and
i
had
been
living
ever
since
in
an
atmosphere
of
bally
disapproval
till
i
was
getting
jolly
well
fed
up
with
it
what
i
mean
is
while
there
no
doubt
that
in
certain
matters
of
dress
jeeves
judgment
is
absolutely
sound
and
should
be
followed
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
getting
a
bit
too
thick
if
he
was
going
to
edit
my
face
as
well
as
my
costume
no
one
can
call
me
an
unreasonable
chappie
and
many
the
time
i
given
in
like
a
lamb
when
jeeves
has
voted
against
one
of
my
pet
suits
or
ties
but
when
it
comes
to
a
valet
staking
out
a
claim
on
your
upper
lip
you
simply
got
to
have
a
bit
of
the
good
old
bulldog
pluck
and
defy
the
blighter
he
said
that
he
would
call
again
later
sir
something
must
be
up
jeeves
yes
sir
i
gave
the
moustache
a
thoughtful
twirl
it
seemed
to
hurt
jeeves
a
good
deal
so
i
chucked
it
i
see
by
the
paper
sir
that
bickersteth
uncle
is
arriving
on
the
yes
his
grace
the
duke
of
chiswick
sir
this
was
news
to
me
that
bicky
uncle
was
a
duke
rum
how
little
one
knows
about
one
pals
i
had
met
bicky
for
the
first
time
at
a
species
of
beano
or
jamboree
down
in
washington
square
not
long
after
my
arrival
in
new
york
i
suppose
i
was
a
bit
homesick
at
the
time
and
i
rather
took
to
bicky
when
i
found
that
he
was
an
englishman
and
had
in
fact
been
up
at
oxford
with
me
besides
he
was
a
frightful
chump
so
we
naturally
drifted
together
and
while
we
were
taking
a
quiet
snort
in
a
corner
that
was
all
cluttered
up
with
artists
and
sculptors
and
he
furthermore
endeared
himself
to
me
by
a
most
extraordinarily
gifted
imitation
of
a
chasing
a
cat
up
a
tree
but
though
we
had
subsequently
become
extremely
pally
all
i
really
knew
about
him
was
that
he
was
generally
hard
up
and
had
an
uncle
who
relieved
the
strain
a
bit
from
time
to
time
by
sending
him
monthly
remittances
if
the
duke
of
chiswick
is
his
uncle
i
said
why
has
he
a
title
why
is
he
lord
bickersteth
is
the
son
of
his
grace
late
sister
sir
who
married
captain
rollo
bickersteth
of
the
coldstream
guards
jeeves
knows
everything
is
bickersteth
father
dead
too
yes
sir
leave
any
money
no
sir
i
began
to
understand
why
poor
old
bicky
was
always
more
or
less
on
the
rocks
to
the
casual
and
irreflective
observer
if
you
know
what
i
mean
it
may
sound
a
pretty
good
wheeze
having
a
duke
for
an
uncle
but
the
trouble
about
old
chiswick
was
that
though
an
extremely
wealthy
old
buster
owning
half
london
and
about
five
counties
up
north
he
was
notoriously
the
most
prudent
spender
in
england
he
was
what
american
chappies
would
call
a
egg
if
bicky
people
had
left
him
anything
and
he
depended
on
what
he
could
prise
out
of
the
old
duke
he
was
in
a
pretty
bad
way
not
that
that
explained
why
he
was
hunting
me
like
this
because
he
was
a
chap
who
never
borrowed
money
he
said
he
wanted
to
keep
his
pals
so
never
bit
any
one
ear
on
principle
at
this
juncture
the
door
bell
rang
jeeves
floated
out
to
answer
it
yes
sir
wooster
has
just
returned
i
heard
him
say
and
bicky
came
trickling
in
looking
pretty
sorry
for
himself
halloa
bicky
i
said
jeeves
told
me
you
had
been
trying
to
get
me
jeeves
bring
another
glass
and
let
the
revels
commence
what
the
trouble
bicky
i
in
a
hole
bertie
i
want
your
advice
say
on
old
lad
my
uncle
turning
up
bertie
so
jeeves
told
me
the
duke
of
chiswick
you
know
so
jeeves
told
me
bicky
seemed
a
bit
surprised
jeeves
seems
to
know
everything
rather
rummily
that
exactly
what
i
was
thinking
just
now
myself
well
i
wish
said
bicky
gloomily
that
he
knew
a
way
to
get
me
out
of
the
hole
i
in
jeeves
shimmered
in
with
the
glass
and
stuck
it
competently
on
the
table
bickersteth
is
in
a
bit
of
a
hole
jeeves
i
said
and
wants
you
to
rally
round
very
good
sir
bicky
looked
a
bit
doubtful
well
of
course
you
know
bertie
this
thing
is
by
way
of
being
a
bit
private
and
all
that
i
should
worry
about
that
old
top
i
bet
jeeves
knows
all
about
it
already
do
you
jeeves
yes
sir
eh
said
bicky
rattled
i
am
open
to
correction
sir
but
is
not
your
dilemma
due
to
the
fact
that
you
are
at
a
loss
to
explain
to
his
grace
why
you
are
in
new
york
instead
of
in
colorado
bicky
rocked
like
a
jelly
in
a
high
wind
how
the
deuce
do
you
know
anything
about
it
i
chanced
to
meet
his
grace
butler
before
we
left
england
he
informed
me
that
he
happened
to
overhear
his
grace
speaking
to
you
on
the
matter
sir
as
he
passed
the
library
door
bicky
gave
a
hollow
sort
of
laugh
well
as
everybody
seems
to
know
all
about
it
there
no
need
to
try
to
keep
it
dark
the
old
boy
turfed
me
out
bertie
because
he
said
i
was
a
brainless
nincompoop
the
idea
was
that
he
would
give
me
a
remittance
on
condition
that
i
dashed
out
to
some
blighted
locality
of
the
name
of
colorado
and
learned
farming
or
ranching
or
whatever
they
call
it
at
some
bally
ranch
or
farm
or
whatever
it
called
i
fancy
the
idea
a
bit
i
should
have
had
to
ride
horses
and
pursue
cows
and
so
forth
i
hate
horses
they
bite
at
you
i
was
all
against
the
scheme
at
the
same
time
do
you
know
i
had
to
have
that
remittance
i
get
you
absolutely
dear
boy
well
when
i
got
to
new
york
it
looked
a
decent
sort
of
place
to
me
so
i
thought
it
would
be
a
pretty
sound
notion
to
stop
here
so
i
cabled
to
my
uncle
telling
him
that
i
had
dropped
into
a
good
business
wheeze
in
the
city
and
wanted
to
chuck
the
ranch
idea
he
wrote
back
that
it
was
all
right
and
here
i
been
ever
since
he
thinks
doing
well
at
something
or
other
over
here
i
never
dreamed
do
you
know
that
he
would
ever
come
out
here
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
jeeves
i
said
what
on
earth
is
bickersteth
to
do
you
see
said
bicky
i
had
a
wireless
from
him
to
say
that
he
was
coming
to
stay
with
me
to
save
hotel
bills
i
suppose
i
always
given
him
the
impression
that
i
was
living
in
pretty
good
style
i
ca
have
him
to
stay
at
my
thought
of
anything
jeeves
i
said
to
what
extent
sir
if
the
question
is
not
a
delicate
one
are
you
prepared
to
assist
mr
bickersteth
i
do
anything
i
can
for
you
of
course
bicky
old
man
then
if
i
might
make
the
suggestion
sir
you
might
lend
bickersteth
no
by
jove
said
bicky
firmly
i
never
have
touched
you
bertie
and
i
not
going
to
start
now
i
may
be
a
chump
but
it
my
boast
that
i
do
owe
a
penny
to
a
single
soul
not
counting
tradesmen
of
course
i
was
about
to
suggest
sir
that
you
might
lend
bickersteth
this
flat
bickersteth
could
give
his
grace
the
impression
that
he
was
the
owner
of
it
with
your
permission
i
could
convey
the
notion
that
i
was
in
bickersteth
employment
and
not
in
yours
you
would
be
residing
here
temporarily
as
bickersteth
guest
his
grace
would
occupy
the
second
spare
bedroom
i
fancy
that
you
would
find
this
answer
satisfactorily
sir
bicky
had
stopped
rocking
himself
and
was
staring
at
jeeves
in
an
awed
sort
of
way
i
would
advocate
the
dispatching
of
a
wireless
message
to
his
grace
on
board
the
vessel
notifying
him
of
the
change
of
address
bickersteth
could
meet
his
grace
at
the
dock
and
proceed
directly
here
will
that
meet
the
situation
sir
absolutely
thank
you
sir
bicky
followed
him
with
his
eye
till
the
door
closed
how
does
he
do
it
bertie
he
said
i
tell
you
what
i
think
it
is
i
believe
it
something
to
do
with
the
shape
of
his
head
have
you
ever
noticed
his
head
bertie
old
man
it
sort
of
sticks
out
at
the
back
i
hopped
out
of
bed
early
next
morning
so
as
to
be
among
those
present
when
the
old
boy
should
arrive
i
knew
from
experience
that
these
ocean
liners
fetch
up
at
the
dock
at
a
deucedly
ungodly
hour
it
was
much
after
nine
by
the
time
i
dressed
and
had
my
morning
tea
and
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
watching
the
street
for
bicky
and
his
uncle
it
was
one
of
those
jolly
peaceful
mornings
that
make
a
chappie
wish
he
got
a
soul
or
something
and
i
was
just
brooding
on
life
in
general
when
i
became
aware
of
the
dickens
of
a
spate
in
progress
down
below
a
taxi
had
driven
up
and
an
old
boy
in
a
top
hat
had
got
out
and
was
kicking
up
a
frightful
row
about
the
fare
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
he
was
trying
to
get
the
cab
chappie
to
switch
from
new
york
to
london
prices
and
the
cab
chappie
had
apparently
never
heard
of
london
before
and
did
seem
to
think
a
lot
of
it
now
the
old
boy
said
that
in
london
the
trip
would
have
set
him
back
eightpence
and
the
cabby
said
he
should
worry
i
called
to
jeeves
the
duke
has
arrived
jeeves
yes
sir
that
be
him
at
the
door
now
jeeves
made
a
long
arm
and
opened
the
front
door
and
the
old
boy
crawled
in
looking
licked
to
a
splinter
how
do
you
do
sir
i
said
bustling
up
and
being
the
ray
of
sunshine
your
nephew
went
down
to
the
dock
to
meet
you
but
you
must
have
missed
him
my
name
wooster
do
you
know
great
pal
of
bicky
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
staying
with
him
you
know
would
you
like
a
cup
of
tea
jeeves
bring
a
cup
of
tea
old
chiswick
had
sunk
into
an
and
was
looking
about
the
room
does
this
luxurious
flat
belong
to
my
nephew
francis
absolutely
it
must
be
terribly
expensive
pretty
well
of
course
everything
costs
a
lot
over
here
you
know
he
moaned
jeeves
filtered
in
with
the
tea
old
chiswick
took
a
stab
at
it
to
restore
his
tissues
and
nodded
a
terrible
country
wooster
a
terrible
country
nearly
eight
shillings
for
a
short
iniquitous
he
took
another
look
round
the
room
it
seemed
to
fascinate
him
have
you
any
idea
how
much
my
nephew
pays
for
this
flat
mr
wooster
about
two
hundred
dollars
a
month
i
believe
what
forty
pounds
a
month
i
began
to
see
that
unless
i
made
the
thing
a
bit
more
plausible
the
scheme
might
turn
out
a
frost
i
could
guess
what
the
old
boy
was
thinking
he
was
trying
to
square
all
this
prosperity
with
what
he
knew
of
poor
old
bicky
and
one
had
to
admit
that
it
took
a
lot
of
squaring
for
dear
old
bicky
though
a
stout
fellow
and
absolutely
unrivalled
as
an
imitator
of
and
cats
was
in
many
ways
one
of
the
most
pronounced
fatheads
that
ever
pulled
on
a
suit
of
gent
underwear
i
suppose
it
seems
rummy
to
you
i
said
but
the
fact
is
new
york
often
bucks
chappies
up
and
makes
them
show
a
flash
of
speed
that
you
would
have
imagined
them
capable
of
it
sort
of
develops
them
something
in
the
air
do
you
know
i
imagine
that
bicky
in
the
past
when
you
knew
him
may
have
been
something
of
a
chump
but
it
quite
different
now
devilish
efficient
sort
of
chappie
and
looked
on
in
commercial
circles
as
quite
the
nib
i
am
amazed
what
is
the
nature
of
my
nephew
business
mr
wooster
oh
just
business
do
you
know
the
same
sort
of
thing
carnegie
and
rockefeller
and
all
these
coves
do
you
know
i
slid
for
the
door
awfully
sorry
to
leave
you
but
i
got
to
meet
some
of
the
lads
elsewhere
coming
out
of
the
lift
i
met
bicky
bustling
in
from
the
street
halloa
bertie
i
missed
him
has
he
turned
up
he
upstairs
now
having
some
tea
what
does
he
think
of
it
all
he
absolutely
rattled
ripping
i
be
toddling
up
then
bertie
old
man
see
you
later
bicky
dear
boy
he
trotted
off
full
of
merriment
and
good
cheer
and
i
went
off
to
the
club
to
sit
in
the
window
and
watch
the
traffic
coming
up
one
way
and
going
down
the
other
it
was
latish
in
the
evening
when
i
looked
in
at
the
flat
to
dress
for
dinner
where
everybody
jeeves
i
said
finding
no
little
feet
pattering
about
the
place
gone
out
his
grace
desired
to
see
some
of
the
sights
of
the
city
sir
bickersteth
is
acting
as
his
escort
i
fancy
their
immediate
objective
was
grant
tomb
i
suppose
bickersteth
is
a
bit
braced
at
the
way
things
are
going
what
sir
i
say
i
take
it
that
bickersteth
is
tolerably
full
of
beans
not
altogether
sir
what
his
trouble
now
the
scheme
which
i
took
the
liberty
of
suggesting
to
bickersteth
and
yourself
has
unfortunately
not
answered
entirely
satisfactorily
sir
surely
the
duke
believes
that
bickersteth
is
doing
well
in
business
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
exactly
sir
with
the
result
that
he
has
decided
to
cancel
bickersteth
monthly
allowance
on
the
ground
that
as
bickersteth
is
doing
so
well
on
his
own
account
he
no
longer
requires
pecuniary
assistance
great
scot
jeeves
this
is
awful
somewhat
disturbing
sir
i
never
expected
anything
like
this
i
confess
i
scarcely
anticipated
the
contingency
myself
sir
i
suppose
it
bowled
the
poor
blighter
over
absolutely
bickersteth
appeared
somewhat
taken
aback
sir
my
heart
bled
for
bicky
we
must
do
something
jeeves
yes
sir
can
you
think
of
anything
not
at
the
moment
sir
there
must
be
something
we
can
do
it
was
a
maxim
of
one
of
my
former
employers
sir
as
i
believe
i
mentioned
to
you
once
before
the
present
lord
bridgnorth
that
there
is
always
a
way
i
remember
his
lordship
using
the
expression
on
the
occasion
he
was
then
a
business
gentleman
and
had
not
yet
received
his
title
when
a
patent
which
he
chanced
to
be
promoting
failed
to
attract
the
public
he
put
it
on
the
market
under
another
name
as
a
depilatory
and
amassed
a
substantial
fortune
i
have
generally
found
his
lordship
aphorism
based
on
sound
foundations
no
doubt
we
shall
be
able
to
discover
some
solution
of
difficulty
sir
well
have
a
stab
at
it
jeeves
i
will
spare
no
pains
sir
i
went
and
dressed
sadly
it
will
show
you
pretty
well
how
pipped
i
was
when
i
tell
you
that
i
near
as
a
toucher
put
on
a
white
tie
with
a
i
sallied
out
for
a
bit
of
food
more
to
pass
the
time
than
because
i
wanted
it
it
seemed
brutal
to
be
wading
into
the
bill
of
fare
with
poor
old
bicky
headed
for
the
breadline
when
i
got
back
old
chiswick
had
gone
to
bed
but
bicky
was
there
hunched
up
in
an
brooding
pretty
tensely
with
a
cigarette
hanging
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
a
more
or
less
glassy
stare
in
his
eyes
he
had
the
aspect
of
one
who
had
been
soaked
with
what
the
newspaper
chappies
call
some
blunt
instrument
this
is
a
bit
thick
old
thing
what
i
said
he
picked
up
his
glass
and
drained
it
feverishly
overlooking
the
fact
that
it
had
anything
in
it
i
done
bertie
he
said
he
had
another
go
at
the
glass
it
did
seem
to
do
him
any
good
if
only
this
had
happened
a
week
later
bertie
my
next
month
money
was
due
to
roll
in
on
saturday
i
could
have
worked
a
wheeze
i
been
reading
about
in
the
magazine
advertisements
it
seems
that
you
can
make
a
dashed
amount
of
money
if
you
can
only
collect
a
few
dollars
and
start
a
jolly
sound
scheme
bertie
say
you
buy
a
hen
call
it
one
hen
for
the
sake
of
argument
it
lays
an
egg
every
day
of
the
week
you
sell
the
eggs
seven
for
cents
keep
of
hen
costs
nothing
profit
practically
cents
on
every
seven
eggs
or
look
at
it
another
way
suppose
you
have
a
dozen
eggs
each
of
the
hens
has
a
dozen
chickens
the
chickens
grow
up
and
have
more
chickens
why
in
no
time
you
have
the
place
covered
in
hens
all
laying
eggs
at
cents
for
every
seven
make
a
fortune
jolly
life
too
keeping
hens
he
had
begun
to
get
quite
worked
up
at
the
thought
of
it
but
he
slopped
back
in
his
chair
at
this
juncture
with
a
good
deal
of
gloom
but
of
course
it
no
good
he
said
because
i
have
the
cash
you
only
to
say
the
word
you
know
bicky
old
top
thanks
awfully
bertie
but
i
not
going
to
sponge
on
you
that
always
the
way
in
this
world
the
chappies
you
like
to
lend
money
to
wo
let
you
whereas
the
chappies
you
do
want
to
lend
it
to
will
do
everything
except
actually
stand
you
on
your
head
and
lift
the
specie
out
of
your
pockets
as
a
lad
who
has
always
rolled
tolerably
free
in
the
right
stuff
i
had
lots
of
experience
of
the
second
class
many
the
time
back
in
london
i
hurried
along
piccadilly
and
felt
the
hot
breath
of
the
toucher
on
the
back
of
my
neck
and
heard
his
sharp
excited
yapping
as
he
closed
in
on
me
simply
spent
my
life
scattering
largesse
to
blighters
i
did
care
a
hang
for
yet
here
was
i
now
dripping
doubloons
and
pieces
of
eight
and
longing
to
hand
them
over
and
bicky
poor
fish
absolutely
on
his
uppers
not
taking
any
at
any
price
well
there
only
one
hope
then
what
that
jeeves
sir
there
was
jeeves
standing
behind
me
full
of
zeal
in
this
matter
of
shimmering
into
rooms
the
chappie
is
rummy
to
a
degree
you
sitting
in
the
old
thinking
of
this
and
that
and
then
suddenly
you
look
up
and
there
he
is
he
moves
from
point
to
point
with
as
little
uproar
as
a
jelly
fish
the
thing
startled
poor
old
bicky
considerably
he
rose
from
his
seat
like
a
rocketing
pheasant
i
used
to
jeeves
now
but
often
in
the
days
when
he
first
came
to
me
i
bitten
my
tongue
freely
on
finding
him
unexpectedly
in
my
midst
did
you
call
sir
oh
there
you
are
jeeves
precisely
sir
jeeves
bickersteth
is
still
up
the
pole
any
ideas
why
yes
sir
since
we
had
our
recent
conversation
i
fancy
i
have
found
what
may
prove
a
solution
i
do
not
wish
to
appear
to
be
taking
a
liberty
sir
but
i
think
that
we
have
overlooked
his
potentialities
as
a
source
of
revenue
bicky
laughed
what
i
have
sometimes
seen
described
as
a
hollow
mocking
laugh
a
sort
of
bitter
cackle
from
the
back
of
the
throat
rather
like
a
gargle
i
do
not
allude
sir
explained
jeeves
to
the
possibility
of
inducing
his
grace
to
part
with
money
i
am
taking
the
liberty
of
regarding
his
grace
in
the
light
of
an
at
present
if
i
may
say
so
useless
property
which
is
capable
of
being
developed
bicky
looked
at
me
in
a
helpless
kind
of
way
i
bound
to
say
i
get
it
myself
could
you
make
it
a
bit
easier
jeeves
in
a
nutshell
sir
what
i
mean
is
this
his
grace
is
in
a
sense
a
prominent
personage
the
inhabitants
of
this
country
as
no
doubt
you
are
aware
sir
are
peculiarly
addicted
to
shaking
hands
with
prominent
personages
it
occurred
to
me
that
bickersteth
or
yourself
might
know
of
persons
who
would
be
willing
to
pay
a
small
fee
let
us
say
two
dollars
or
three
for
the
privilege
of
an
introduction
including
handshake
to
his
grace
bicky
did
seem
to
think
much
of
it
do
you
mean
to
say
that
anyone
would
be
mug
enough
to
part
with
solid
cash
just
to
shake
hands
with
my
uncle
i
have
an
aunt
sir
who
paid
five
shillings
to
a
young
fellow
for
bringing
a
actor
to
tea
at
her
house
one
sunday
it
gave
her
social
standing
among
the
neighbours
bicky
wavered
if
you
think
it
could
be
done
i
feel
convinced
of
it
sir
what
do
you
think
bertie
i
for
it
old
boy
absolutely
a
very
brainy
wheeze
thank
you
sir
will
there
be
anything
further
good
night
sir
and
he
floated
out
leaving
us
to
discuss
details
until
we
started
this
business
of
floating
old
chiswick
as
a
proposition
i
had
never
realized
what
a
perfectly
foul
time
those
stock
exchange
chappies
must
have
when
the
public
is
biting
freely
nowadays
i
read
that
bit
they
put
in
the
financial
reports
about
the
market
opened
quietly
with
a
sympathetic
eye
for
by
jove
it
certainly
opened
quietly
for
us
you
hardly
believe
how
difficult
it
was
to
interest
the
public
and
make
them
take
a
flutter
on
the
old
boy
by
the
end
of
the
week
the
only
name
we
had
on
our
list
was
a
keeper
down
in
bicky
part
of
the
town
and
as
he
wanted
us
to
take
it
out
in
sliced
ham
instead
of
cash
that
did
help
much
there
was
a
gleam
of
light
when
the
brother
of
bicky
pawnbroker
offered
ten
dollars
money
down
for
an
introduction
to
old
chiswick
but
the
deal
fell
through
owing
to
its
turning
out
that
the
chap
was
an
anarchist
and
intended
to
kick
the
old
boy
instead
of
shaking
hands
with
him
at
that
it
took
me
the
deuce
of
a
time
to
persuade
bicky
not
to
grab
the
cash
and
let
things
take
their
course
he
seemed
to
regard
the
pawnbroker
brother
rather
as
a
sportsman
and
benefactor
of
his
species
than
otherwise
the
whole
thing
i
inclined
to
think
would
have
been
off
if
it
had
been
for
jeeves
there
is
no
doubt
that
jeeves
is
in
a
class
of
his
own
in
the
matter
of
brain
and
resource
i
do
think
i
have
ever
met
a
chappie
so
supremely
like
mother
made
he
trickled
into
my
room
one
morning
with
a
good
old
cup
of
tea
and
intimated
that
there
was
something
doing
might
i
speak
to
you
with
regard
to
that
matter
of
his
grace
sir
it
all
off
we
decided
to
chuck
it
sir
it
wo
work
we
ca
get
anybody
to
come
i
fancy
i
can
arrange
that
aspect
of
the
matter
sir
do
you
mean
to
say
you
managed
to
get
anybody
yes
sir
gentlemen
from
birdsburg
sir
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
spilt
the
tea
birdsburg
birdsburg
missouri
sir
how
did
you
get
them
i
happened
last
night
sir
as
you
had
intimated
that
you
would
be
absent
from
home
to
attend
a
theatrical
performance
and
entered
into
conversation
between
the
acts
with
the
occupant
of
the
adjoining
seat
i
had
observed
that
he
was
wearing
a
somewhat
ornate
decoration
in
his
buttonhole
sir
a
large
blue
button
with
the
words
for
birdsburg
upon
it
in
red
letters
scarcely
a
judicious
addition
to
a
gentleman
evening
costume
to
my
surprise
i
noticed
that
the
auditorium
was
full
of
persons
similarly
decorated
i
ventured
to
inquire
the
explanation
and
was
informed
that
these
gentlemen
forming
a
party
of
are
a
convention
from
a
town
of
the
name
if
birdsburg
in
the
state
of
missouri
their
visit
i
gathered
was
purely
of
a
social
and
pleasurable
nature
and
my
informant
spoke
at
some
length
of
the
entertainments
arranged
for
their
stay
in
the
city
it
was
when
he
related
with
a
considerable
amount
of
satisfaction
and
pride
that
a
deputation
of
their
number
had
been
introduced
to
and
had
shaken
hands
with
a
prizefighter
that
it
occurred
to
me
to
broach
the
subject
of
his
grace
to
make
a
long
story
short
sir
i
have
arranged
subject
to
your
approval
that
the
entire
convention
shall
be
presented
to
his
grace
afternoon
i
was
amazed
this
chappie
was
a
napoleon
jeeves
at
how
much
a
head
i
was
obliged
to
agree
to
a
reduction
for
quantity
sir
the
terms
finally
arrived
at
were
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
the
party
i
thought
a
bit
payable
in
advance
no
sir
i
endeavoured
to
obtain
payment
in
advance
but
was
not
successful
well
any
way
when
we
get
it
i
make
it
up
to
five
hundred
bicky
never
know
do
you
suspect
bickersteth
would
suspect
anything
jeeves
if
i
made
it
up
to
five
hundred
i
fancy
not
sir
bickersteth
is
an
agreeable
gentleman
but
not
bright
all
right
then
after
breakfast
run
down
to
the
bank
and
get
me
some
money
yes
sir
you
know
you
a
bit
of
a
marvel
jeeves
thank
you
sir
very
good
sir
when
i
took
dear
old
bicky
aside
in
the
course
of
the
morning
and
told
him
what
had
happened
he
nearly
broke
down
he
tottered
into
the
and
buttonholed
old
chiswick
who
was
reading
the
comic
section
of
the
morning
paper
with
a
kind
of
grim
resolution
uncle
he
said
are
you
doing
anything
special
afternoon
i
mean
to
say
i
asked
a
few
of
my
pals
in
to
meet
you
do
you
know
the
old
boy
cocked
a
speculative
eye
at
him
there
will
be
no
reporters
among
them
reporters
rather
not
why
i
refuse
to
be
badgered
by
reporters
there
were
a
number
of
adhesive
young
men
who
endeavoured
to
elicit
from
me
my
views
on
america
while
the
boat
was
approaching
the
dock
i
will
not
be
subjected
to
this
persecution
again
that
be
absolutely
all
right
uncle
there
wo
be
a
in
the
place
in
that
case
i
shall
be
glad
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
your
friends
you
shake
hands
with
them
and
so
forth
i
shall
naturally
order
my
behaviour
according
to
the
accepted
rules
of
civilized
intercourse
bicky
thanked
him
heartily
and
came
off
to
lunch
with
me
at
the
club
where
he
babbled
freely
of
hens
incubators
and
other
rotten
things
after
mature
consideration
we
had
decided
to
unleash
the
birdsburg
contingent
on
the
old
boy
ten
at
a
time
jeeves
brought
his
theatre
pal
round
to
see
us
and
we
arranged
the
whole
thing
with
him
a
very
decent
chappie
but
rather
inclined
to
collar
the
conversation
and
turn
it
in
the
direction
of
his
new
system
we
settled
that
as
an
hour
was
about
all
he
would
be
likely
to
stand
each
gang
should
consider
itself
entitled
to
seven
minutes
of
the
duke
society
by
jeeves
and
that
when
their
time
was
up
jeeves
should
slide
into
the
room
and
cough
meaningly
then
we
parted
with
what
i
believe
are
called
mutual
expressions
of
goodwill
the
birdsburg
chappie
extending
a
cordial
invitation
to
us
all
to
pop
out
some
day
and
take
a
look
at
the
new
system
for
which
we
thanked
him
next
day
the
deputation
rolled
in
the
first
shift
consisted
of
the
cove
we
had
met
and
nine
others
almost
exactly
like
him
in
every
respect
they
all
looked
deuced
keen
and
businesslike
as
if
from
youth
up
they
had
been
working
in
the
office
and
catching
the
boss
eye
and
they
shook
hands
with
the
old
boy
with
a
good
deal
of
apparent
satisfaction
all
except
one
chappie
who
seemed
to
be
brooding
about
something
and
then
they
stood
off
and
became
chatty
what
message
have
you
for
birdsburg
duke
asked
our
pal
the
old
boy
seemed
a
bit
rattled
i
have
never
been
to
birdsburg
the
chappie
seemed
pained
you
should
pay
it
a
visit
he
said
the
most
city
in
the
country
boost
for
birdsburg
boost
for
birdsburg
said
the
other
chappies
reverently
the
chappie
who
had
been
brooding
suddenly
gave
tongue
say
he
was
a
stout
sort
of
cove
with
one
of
those
determined
chins
and
a
cold
eye
the
assemblage
looked
at
him
as
a
matter
of
business
said
the
chappie
mind
you
i
not
questioning
anybody
good
faith
but
as
a
matter
of
strict
business
i
think
this
gentleman
here
ought
to
put
himself
on
record
before
witnesses
as
stating
that
he
really
is
a
duke
what
do
you
mean
sir
cried
the
old
boy
getting
purple
no
offence
simply
business
i
not
saying
anything
mind
you
but
there
one
thing
that
seems
kind
of
funny
to
me
this
gentleman
here
says
his
name
bickersteth
as
i
understand
it
well
if
the
duke
of
chiswick
why
is
he
lord
percy
something
i
read
english
novels
and
i
know
all
about
it
this
is
monstrous
now
do
get
hot
under
the
collar
i
only
asking
i
a
right
to
know
you
going
to
take
our
money
so
it
only
fair
that
we
should
see
that
we
get
our
money
worth
the
cove
chipped
in
you
quite
right
simms
i
overlooked
that
when
making
the
agreement
you
see
gentlemen
as
business
men
we
a
right
to
reasonable
guarantees
of
good
faith
we
are
paying
bickersteth
here
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
this
reception
and
we
naturally
want
to
know
old
chiswick
gave
bicky
a
searching
look
then
he
turned
to
the
chappie
he
was
frightfully
calm
i
can
assure
you
that
i
know
nothing
of
this
he
said
quite
politely
i
should
be
grateful
if
you
would
explain
well
we
arranged
with
bickersteth
that
citizens
of
birdsburg
should
have
the
privilege
of
meeting
and
shaking
hands
with
you
for
a
financial
consideration
mutually
arranged
and
what
my
friend
simms
here
means
and
i
with
him
is
that
we
have
only
bickersteth
word
for
it
and
he
is
a
stranger
to
us
that
you
are
the
duke
of
chiswick
at
all
old
chiswick
gulped
allow
me
to
assure
you
sir
he
said
in
a
rummy
kind
of
voice
that
i
am
the
duke
of
chiswick
then
that
all
right
said
the
chappie
heartily
that
was
all
we
wanted
to
know
let
the
thing
go
on
i
am
sorry
to
say
said
old
chiswick
that
it
can
not
go
on
i
am
feeling
a
little
tired
i
fear
i
must
ask
to
be
excused
but
there
are
of
the
boys
waiting
round
the
corner
at
this
moment
duke
to
be
introduced
to
you
i
fear
i
must
disappoint
them
but
in
that
case
the
deal
would
have
to
be
off
that
is
a
matter
for
you
and
my
nephew
to
discuss
the
chappie
seemed
troubled
you
really
wo
meet
the
rest
of
them
no
well
then
i
guess
we
be
going
they
went
out
and
there
was
a
pretty
solid
silence
then
old
chiswick
turned
to
bicky
well
bicky
did
seem
to
have
anything
to
say
was
it
true
what
that
man
said
yes
uncle
what
do
you
mean
by
playing
this
trick
bicky
seemed
pretty
well
knocked
out
so
i
put
in
a
word
i
think
you
better
explain
the
whole
thing
bicky
old
top
bicky
jumped
about
a
bit
then
he
started
you
see
you
had
cut
off
my
allowance
uncle
and
i
wanted
a
bit
of
money
to
start
a
chicken
farm
i
mean
to
say
it
an
absolute
cert
if
you
once
get
a
bit
of
capital
you
buy
a
hen
and
it
lays
an
egg
every
day
of
the
week
and
you
sell
the
eggs
say
seven
for
cents
keep
of
hens
cost
nothing
profit
practically
what
is
all
this
nonsense
about
hens
you
led
me
to
suppose
you
were
a
substantial
business
man
old
bicky
rather
exaggerated
sir
i
said
helping
the
chappie
out
the
fact
is
the
poor
old
lad
is
absolutely
dependent
on
that
remittance
of
yours
and
when
you
cut
it
off
do
you
know
he
was
pretty
solidly
in
the
soup
and
had
to
think
of
some
way
of
closing
in
on
a
bit
of
the
ready
pretty
quick
that
why
we
thought
of
this
handshaking
scheme
old
chiswick
foamed
at
the
mouth
so
you
have
lied
to
me
you
have
deliberately
deceived
me
as
to
your
financial
status
poor
old
bicky
did
want
to
go
to
that
ranch
i
explained
he
does
like
cows
and
horses
but
he
rather
thinks
he
would
be
hot
stuff
among
the
hens
all
he
wants
is
a
bit
of
capital
do
you
think
it
would
be
rather
a
wheeze
if
you
were
to
after
what
has
happened
after
this
this
deceit
and
foolery
not
a
penny
but
not
a
penny
there
was
a
respectful
cough
in
the
background
if
i
might
make
a
suggestion
sir
jeeves
was
standing
on
the
horizon
looking
devilish
brainy
go
ahead
jeeves
i
said
i
would
merely
suggest
sir
that
if
bickersteth
is
in
need
of
a
little
ready
money
and
is
at
a
loss
to
obtain
it
elsewhere
he
might
secure
the
sum
he
requires
by
describing
the
occurrences
of
this
afternoon
for
the
sunday
issue
of
one
of
the
more
spirited
and
enterprising
newspapers
by
jove
i
said
by
george
said
bicky
great
heavens
said
old
chiswick
very
good
sir
said
jeeves
bicky
turned
to
old
chiswick
with
a
gleaming
eye
jeeves
is
right
i
do
it
the
would
jump
at
it
they
eat
that
sort
of
stuff
old
chiswick
gave
a
kind
of
moaning
howl
i
absolutely
forbid
you
francis
to
do
this
thing
that
all
very
well
said
bicky
wonderfully
braced
but
if
i
get
the
money
any
other
way
wait
er
wait
my
boy
you
are
so
impetuous
we
might
arrange
something
i
wo
go
to
that
bally
ranch
no
no
no
no
my
boy
i
would
not
suggest
it
i
would
not
for
a
moment
suggest
it
i
i
think
he
seemed
to
have
a
bit
of
a
struggle
with
himself
i
i
think
that
on
the
whole
it
would
be
best
if
you
returned
with
me
to
england
i
i
might
in
fact
i
think
i
see
my
way
to
doing
to
i
might
be
able
to
utilize
your
services
in
some
secretarial
position
i
should
mind
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
offer
you
a
salary
but
as
you
know
in
english
political
life
the
unpaid
secretary
is
a
recognized
figure
the
only
figure
i
recognize
said
bicky
firmly
is
five
hundred
quid
a
year
paid
quarterly
my
dear
boy
absolutely
but
your
recompense
my
dear
francis
would
consist
in
the
unrivalled
opportunities
you
would
have
as
my
secretary
to
gain
experience
to
accustom
yourself
to
the
intricacies
of
political
life
to
in
fact
you
would
be
in
an
exceedingly
advantageous
position
five
hundred
a
year
said
bicky
rolling
it
round
his
tongue
why
that
would
be
nothing
to
what
i
could
make
if
i
started
a
chicken
farm
it
stands
to
reason
suppose
you
have
a
dozen
hens
each
of
the
hens
has
a
dozen
chickens
after
a
bit
the
chickens
grow
up
and
have
a
dozen
chickens
each
themselves
and
then
they
all
start
laying
eggs
a
fortune
in
it
you
can
get
anything
you
like
for
eggs
in
america
chappies
keep
them
on
ice
for
years
and
years
and
do
sell
them
till
they
fetch
about
a
dollar
a
whirl
you
do
think
i
going
to
chuck
a
future
like
this
for
anything
under
five
hundred
o
goblins
a
year
what
a
look
of
anguish
passed
over
old
chiswick
face
then
he
seemed
to
be
resigned
to
it
very
well
my
boy
he
said
said
bicky
all
right
then
jeeves
i
said
bicky
had
taken
the
old
boy
off
to
dinner
to
celebrate
and
we
were
alone
jeeves
this
has
been
one
of
your
best
efforts
thank
you
sir
it
beats
me
how
you
do
it
yes
sir
the
only
trouble
is
you
have
got
much
out
of
it
what
i
fancy
bickersteth
intends
i
judge
from
his
remarks
to
signify
his
appreciation
of
anything
i
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
do
to
assist
him
at
some
later
date
when
he
is
in
a
more
favourable
position
to
do
so
it
is
enough
jeeves
sir
it
was
a
wrench
but
i
felt
it
was
the
only
possible
thing
to
be
done
bring
my
shaving
things
a
gleam
of
hope
shone
in
the
chappie
eye
mixed
with
doubt
you
mean
sir
and
shave
off
my
moustache
there
was
a
moment
silence
i
could
see
the
fellow
was
deeply
moved
thank
you
very
much
indeed
sir
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
popped
off
absent
treatment
i
want
to
tell
you
all
about
dear
old
bobbie
cardew
it
a
most
interesting
story
i
ca
put
in
any
literary
style
and
all
that
but
i
do
have
to
do
you
know
because
it
goes
on
its
moral
lesson
if
you
a
man
you
must
miss
it
because
it
be
a
warning
to
you
and
if
you
a
woman
you
wo
want
to
because
it
all
about
how
a
girl
made
a
man
feel
pretty
well
fed
up
with
things
if
you
a
recent
acquaintance
of
bobbie
you
probably
be
surprised
to
hear
that
there
was
a
time
when
he
was
more
remarkable
for
the
weakness
of
his
memory
than
anything
else
dozens
of
fellows
who
have
only
met
bobbie
since
the
change
took
place
have
been
surprised
when
i
told
them
that
yet
it
true
believe
in
the
days
when
i
first
knew
him
bobbie
cardew
was
about
the
most
pronounced
young
rotter
inside
the
radius
people
have
called
me
a
silly
ass
but
i
was
never
in
the
same
class
with
bobbie
when
it
came
to
being
a
silly
ass
he
was
a
man
while
my
handicap
was
about
six
why
if
i
wanted
him
to
dine
with
me
i
used
to
post
him
a
letter
at
the
beginning
of
the
week
and
then
the
day
before
send
him
a
telegram
and
a
on
the
day
itself
and
half
an
hour
before
the
time
we
fixed
a
messenger
in
a
taxi
whose
business
it
was
to
see
that
he
got
in
and
that
the
chauffeur
had
the
address
all
correct
by
doing
this
i
generally
managed
to
get
him
unless
he
had
left
town
before
my
messenger
arrived
the
funny
thing
was
that
he
was
altogether
a
fool
in
other
ways
deep
down
in
him
there
was
a
kind
of
stratum
of
sense
i
had
known
him
once
or
twice
show
an
almost
human
intelligence
but
to
reach
that
stratum
mind
you
you
needed
dynamite
at
least
that
what
i
thought
but
there
was
another
way
which
occurred
to
me
marriage
i
mean
marriage
the
dynamite
of
the
soul
that
was
what
hit
bobbie
he
married
have
you
ever
seen
a
chasing
a
bee
the
pup
sees
the
bee
it
looks
good
to
him
but
he
still
does
know
what
at
the
end
of
it
till
he
gets
there
it
was
like
that
with
bobbie
he
fell
in
love
got
married
with
a
sort
of
whoop
as
if
it
were
the
greatest
fun
in
the
world
and
then
began
to
find
out
things
she
was
the
sort
of
girl
you
would
have
expected
bobbie
to
rave
about
and
yet
i
do
know
what
i
mean
is
she
worked
for
her
living
and
to
a
fellow
who
has
never
done
a
hand
turn
in
his
life
there
undoubtedly
a
sort
of
fascination
a
kind
of
romance
about
a
girl
who
works
for
her
living
her
name
was
anthony
mary
anthony
she
was
about
five
feet
six
she
had
a
ton
and
a
half
of
hair
grey
eyes
and
one
of
those
determined
chins
she
was
a
hospital
nurse
when
bobbie
smashed
himself
up
at
polo
she
was
told
off
by
the
authorities
to
smooth
his
brow
and
rally
round
with
cooling
unguents
and
all
that
and
the
old
boy
been
up
and
about
again
for
more
than
a
week
before
they
popped
off
to
the
registrar
and
fixed
it
up
quite
the
romance
bobbie
broke
the
news
to
me
at
the
club
one
evening
and
next
day
he
introduced
me
to
her
i
admired
her
i
never
worked
myself
my
name
pepper
by
the
way
almost
forgot
to
mention
it
reggie
pepper
my
uncle
edward
was
pepper
wells
and
the
colliery
people
he
left
me
a
sizable
chunk
of
bullion
i
say
i
never
worked
myself
but
i
admire
any
one
who
earns
a
living
under
difficulties
especially
a
girl
and
this
girl
had
had
a
rather
unusually
tough
time
of
it
being
an
orphan
and
all
that
and
having
had
to
do
everything
off
her
own
bat
for
years
mary
and
i
got
along
together
splendidly
we
do
now
but
we
come
to
that
later
i
speaking
of
the
past
she
seemed
to
think
bobbie
the
greatest
thing
on
earth
judging
by
the
way
she
looked
at
him
when
she
thought
i
was
noticing
and
bobbie
seemed
to
think
the
same
about
her
so
that
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
only
dear
old
bobbie
did
forget
to
go
to
the
wedding
they
had
a
sporting
chance
of
being
quite
happy
well
let
brisk
up
a
bit
here
and
jump
a
year
the
story
really
start
till
then
they
took
a
flat
and
settled
down
i
was
in
and
out
of
the
place
quite
a
good
deal
i
kept
my
eyes
open
and
everything
seemed
to
me
to
be
running
along
as
smoothly
as
you
could
want
if
this
was
marriage
i
thought
i
could
see
why
fellows
were
so
frightened
of
it
there
were
a
lot
of
worse
things
that
could
happen
to
a
man
but
we
now
come
to
the
incident
of
the
quiet
dinner
and
it
just
here
that
love
young
dream
hits
a
snag
and
things
begin
to
occur
i
happened
to
meet
bobbie
in
piccadilly
and
he
asked
me
to
come
back
to
dinner
at
the
flat
and
like
a
fool
instead
of
bolting
and
putting
myself
under
police
protection
i
went
when
we
got
to
the
flat
there
was
bobbie
looking
well
i
tell
you
it
staggered
me
her
gold
hair
was
all
piled
up
in
waves
and
crinkles
and
things
with
a
of
diamonds
in
it
and
she
was
wearing
the
most
perfectly
ripping
dress
i
could
begin
to
describe
it
i
can
only
say
it
was
the
limit
it
struck
me
that
if
this
was
how
she
was
in
the
habit
of
looking
every
night
when
they
were
dining
quietly
at
home
together
it
was
no
wonder
that
bobbie
liked
domesticity
here
old
reggie
dear
said
bobbie
i
brought
him
home
to
have
a
bit
of
dinner
i
phone
down
to
the
kitchen
and
ask
them
to
send
it
up
now
what
she
stared
at
him
as
if
she
had
never
seen
him
before
then
she
turned
scarlet
then
she
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
then
she
gave
a
little
laugh
it
was
most
interesting
to
watch
made
me
wish
i
was
up
a
tree
about
eight
hundred
miles
away
then
she
recovered
herself
i
am
so
glad
you
were
able
to
come
pepper
she
said
smiling
at
me
and
after
that
she
was
all
right
at
least
you
would
have
said
so
she
talked
a
lot
at
dinner
and
chaffed
bobbie
and
played
us
ragtime
on
the
piano
afterwards
as
if
she
had
a
care
in
the
world
quite
a
jolly
little
party
it
was
not
i
no
sleuth
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
had
seen
her
face
at
the
beginning
and
i
knew
that
she
was
working
the
whole
time
and
working
hard
to
keep
herself
in
hand
and
that
she
would
have
given
that
diamond
in
her
hair
and
everything
else
she
possessed
to
have
one
good
scream
just
one
sat
through
some
pretty
thick
evenings
in
my
time
but
that
one
had
the
rest
beaten
in
a
canter
at
the
very
earliest
moment
i
grabbed
my
hat
and
got
away
having
seen
what
i
did
i
was
particularly
surprised
to
meet
bobbie
at
the
club
next
day
looking
about
as
merry
and
bright
as
a
lonely
at
an
eskimo
he
started
in
straightway
he
seemed
glad
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
about
it
do
you
know
how
long
i
been
married
he
said
i
did
exactly
about
a
year
is
it
not
a
year
he
said
sadly
exactly
a
year
yesterday
then
i
understood
i
saw
light
a
regular
flash
of
light
yesterday
was
the
anniversary
of
the
wedding
i
arranged
to
take
mary
to
the
savoy
and
on
to
covent
garden
she
particularly
wanted
to
hear
caruso
i
had
the
ticket
for
the
box
in
my
pocket
do
you
know
all
through
dinner
i
had
a
kind
of
rummy
idea
that
there
was
something
forgotten
but
i
could
think
what
till
your
wife
mentioned
it
he
nodded
she
mentioned
it
he
said
thoughtfully
i
did
ask
for
details
women
with
hair
and
chins
like
mary
may
be
angels
most
of
the
time
but
when
they
take
off
their
wings
for
a
bit
they
are
about
it
to
be
absolutely
frank
old
top
said
poor
old
bobbie
in
a
broken
sort
of
way
my
stock
pretty
low
at
home
there
did
seem
much
to
be
done
i
just
lit
a
cigarette
and
sat
there
he
did
want
to
talk
presently
he
went
out
i
stood
at
the
window
of
our
upper
which
looks
out
on
to
piccadilly
and
watched
him
he
walked
slowly
along
for
a
few
yards
stopped
then
walked
on
again
and
finally
turned
into
a
jeweller
which
was
an
instance
of
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
deep
down
in
him
there
was
a
certain
stratum
of
sense
it
was
from
now
on
that
i
began
to
be
really
interested
in
this
problem
of
bobbie
married
life
of
course
one
always
mildly
interested
in
one
friends
marriages
hoping
they
turn
out
well
and
all
that
but
this
was
different
the
average
man
is
like
bobbie
and
the
average
girl
is
like
mary
it
was
that
old
business
of
the
immovable
mass
and
the
irresistible
force
there
was
bobbie
ambling
gently
through
life
a
dear
old
chap
in
a
hundred
ways
but
undoubtedly
a
chump
of
the
first
water
and
there
was
mary
determined
that
he
should
be
a
chump
and
nature
mind
you
on
bobbie
side
when
nature
makes
a
chump
like
dear
old
bobbie
she
proud
of
him
and
does
want
her
handiwork
disturbed
she
gives
him
a
sort
of
natural
armour
to
protect
him
against
outside
interference
and
that
armour
is
shortness
of
memory
shortness
of
memory
keeps
a
man
a
chump
when
but
for
it
he
might
cease
to
be
one
take
my
case
for
instance
i
a
chump
well
if
i
had
remembered
half
the
things
people
have
tried
to
teach
me
during
my
life
my
size
in
hats
would
be
about
number
nine
but
i
did
i
forgot
them
and
it
was
just
the
same
with
bobbie
for
about
a
week
perhaps
a
bit
more
the
recollection
of
that
quiet
little
domestic
evening
bucked
him
up
like
a
tonic
elephants
i
read
somewhere
are
champions
at
the
memory
business
but
they
were
fools
to
bobbie
during
that
week
but
bless
you
the
shock
was
nearly
big
enough
it
had
dinted
the
armour
but
it
had
made
a
hole
in
it
pretty
soon
he
was
back
at
the
old
game
it
was
pathetic
do
you
know
the
poor
girl
loved
him
and
she
was
frightened
it
was
the
thin
edge
of
the
wedge
you
see
and
she
knew
it
a
man
who
forgets
what
day
he
was
married
when
he
been
married
one
year
will
forget
at
about
the
end
of
the
fourth
that
married
at
all
if
she
meant
to
get
him
in
hand
at
all
she
had
got
to
do
it
now
before
he
began
to
drift
away
i
saw
that
clearly
enough
and
i
tried
to
make
bobbie
see
it
when
he
was
by
way
of
pouring
out
his
troubles
to
me
one
afternoon
i
remember
what
it
was
that
he
had
forgotten
the
day
before
but
it
was
something
she
had
asked
him
to
bring
home
for
her
it
may
have
been
a
book
it
such
a
little
thing
to
make
a
fuss
about
said
bobbie
and
she
knows
that
it
simply
because
i
got
such
an
infernal
memory
about
everything
i
ca
remember
anything
never
could
he
talked
on
for
a
while
and
just
as
he
was
going
he
pulled
out
a
couple
of
sovereigns
oh
by
the
way
he
said
what
this
for
i
asked
though
i
knew
i
owe
it
you
how
that
i
said
why
that
bet
on
tuesday
in
the
murray
and
brown
were
playing
a
hundred
up
and
i
gave
you
two
to
one
that
brown
would
win
and
murray
beat
him
by
twenty
odd
so
you
do
remember
some
things
i
said
he
got
quite
excited
said
that
if
i
thought
he
was
the
sort
of
rotter
who
forgot
to
pay
when
he
lost
a
bet
it
was
pretty
rotten
of
me
after
knowing
him
all
these
years
and
a
lot
more
like
that
subside
laddie
i
said
then
i
spoke
to
him
like
a
father
what
you
got
to
do
my
old
college
chum
i
said
is
to
pull
yourself
together
and
jolly
quick
too
as
things
are
shaping
due
for
a
nasty
knock
before
you
know
what
hit
you
you
got
to
make
an
effort
do
say
you
ca
this
two
quid
business
shows
that
even
if
your
memory
is
rocky
you
can
remember
some
things
what
got
to
do
is
to
see
that
wedding
anniversaries
and
so
on
are
included
in
the
list
it
may
be
a
brainstrain
but
you
ca
get
out
of
it
i
suppose
you
right
said
bobbie
but
it
beats
me
why
she
thinks
such
a
lot
of
these
rotten
little
dates
what
it
matter
if
i
forgot
what
day
we
were
married
on
or
what
day
she
was
born
on
or
what
day
the
cat
had
the
measles
she
knows
i
love
her
just
as
much
as
if
i
were
a
memorizing
freak
at
the
halls
that
not
enough
for
a
woman
i
said
they
want
to
be
shown
bear
that
in
mind
and
you
all
right
forget
it
and
there
be
trouble
he
chewed
the
knob
of
his
stick
women
are
frightfully
rummy
he
said
gloomily
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
you
married
one
i
said
i
do
see
that
i
could
have
done
any
more
i
had
put
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
for
him
you
would
have
thought
he
have
seen
the
point
and
that
it
would
have
made
him
brace
up
and
get
a
hold
on
himself
but
no
off
he
went
again
in
the
same
old
way
i
gave
up
arguing
with
him
i
had
a
good
deal
of
time
on
my
hands
but
not
enough
to
amount
to
anything
when
it
was
a
question
of
reforming
dear
old
bobbie
by
argument
if
you
see
a
man
asking
for
trouble
and
insisting
on
getting
it
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
stand
by
and
wait
till
it
comes
to
him
after
that
you
may
get
a
chance
but
till
then
there
nothing
to
be
done
but
i
thought
a
lot
about
him
bobbie
did
get
into
the
soup
all
at
once
weeks
went
by
and
months
and
still
nothing
happened
now
and
then
he
come
into
the
club
with
a
kind
of
cloud
on
his
shining
morning
face
and
i
know
that
there
had
been
doings
in
the
home
but
it
was
till
well
on
in
the
spring
that
he
got
the
thunderbolt
just
where
he
had
been
asking
for
it
in
the
thorax
i
was
smoking
a
quiet
cigarette
one
morning
in
the
window
looking
out
over
piccadilly
and
watching
the
buses
and
motors
going
up
one
way
and
down
the
other
most
interesting
it
is
i
often
do
it
when
in
rushed
bobbie
with
his
eyes
bulging
and
his
face
the
colour
of
an
oyster
waving
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
reggie
he
said
reggie
old
top
she
gone
gone
i
said
who
mary
of
course
gone
left
me
gone
where
i
said
silly
question
perhaps
you
right
anyhow
dear
old
bobbie
nearly
foamed
at
the
mouth
where
how
should
i
know
where
here
read
this
he
pushed
the
paper
into
my
hand
it
was
a
letter
go
on
said
bobbie
read
it
so
i
did
it
certainly
was
quite
a
letter
there
was
not
much
of
it
but
it
was
all
to
the
point
this
is
what
it
said
my
dear
bobbie
i
am
going
away
when
you
care
enough
about
me
to
remember
to
wish
me
many
happy
returns
on
my
birthday
i
will
come
back
my
address
will
be
box
morning
i
read
it
twice
then
i
said
well
why
do
you
why
do
i
what
why
do
you
wish
her
many
happy
returns
it
does
seem
much
to
ask
but
she
says
on
her
birthday
well
when
is
her
birthday
ca
you
understand
said
bobbie
i
forgotten
forgotten
i
said
yes
said
bobbie
forgotten
how
do
you
mean
forgotten
i
said
forgotten
whether
it
the
twentieth
or
the
or
what
how
near
do
you
get
to
it
i
know
it
came
somewhere
between
the
first
of
january
and
the
of
december
that
how
near
i
get
to
it
think
think
what
the
use
of
saying
think
i
have
thought
been
knocking
sparks
out
of
my
brain
ever
since
i
opened
that
letter
and
you
ca
remember
no
i
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
restoratives
well
bobbie
i
said
it
a
pretty
hard
case
to
spring
on
an
untrained
amateur
like
me
suppose
someone
had
come
to
sherlock
holmes
and
said
holmes
here
a
case
for
you
when
is
my
birthday
would
that
have
given
sherlock
a
jolt
however
i
know
enough
about
the
game
to
understand
that
a
fellow
ca
shoot
off
his
deductive
theories
unless
you
start
him
with
a
clue
so
rouse
yourself
out
of
that
trance
and
come
across
with
two
or
three
for
instance
ca
you
remember
the
last
time
she
had
a
birthday
what
sort
of
weather
was
it
that
might
fix
the
month
bobbie
shook
his
head
it
was
just
ordinary
weather
as
near
as
i
can
recollect
warm
warmish
or
cold
well
fairly
cold
perhaps
i
ca
remember
i
ordered
two
more
of
the
same
they
seemed
indicated
in
the
young
detective
manual
you
a
great
help
bobbie
i
said
an
invaluable
assistant
one
of
those
indispensable
adjuncts
without
which
no
home
is
complete
bobbie
seemed
to
be
thinking
i
got
it
he
said
suddenly
look
here
i
gave
her
a
present
on
her
last
birthday
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
go
to
the
shop
hunt
up
the
date
when
it
was
bought
and
the
thing
done
absolutely
what
did
you
give
her
he
sagged
i
ca
remember
he
said
getting
ideas
is
like
golf
some
days
you
right
off
others
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
i
do
suppose
dear
old
bobbie
had
ever
had
two
ideas
in
the
same
morning
before
in
his
life
but
now
he
did
it
without
an
effort
he
just
loosed
another
dry
martini
into
the
undergrowth
and
before
you
could
turn
round
it
had
flushed
quite
a
do
you
know
those
little
books
called
were
you
there
one
for
each
month
they
tell
you
your
character
your
talents
your
strong
points
and
your
weak
points
at
fourpence
halfpenny
a
go
bobbie
idea
was
to
buy
the
whole
twelve
and
go
through
them
till
we
found
out
which
month
hit
off
mary
character
that
would
give
us
the
month
and
narrow
it
down
a
whole
lot
a
pretty
hot
idea
for
a
like
dear
old
bobbie
we
sallied
out
at
once
he
took
half
and
i
took
half
and
we
settled
down
to
work
as
i
say
it
sounded
good
but
when
we
came
to
go
into
the
thing
we
saw
that
there
was
a
flaw
there
was
plenty
of
information
all
right
but
there
was
a
single
month
that
did
have
something
that
exactly
hit
off
mary
for
instance
in
the
december
book
it
said
december
people
are
apt
to
keep
their
own
secrets
they
are
extensive
travellers
well
mary
had
certainly
kept
her
secret
and
she
had
travelled
quite
extensively
enough
for
bobbie
needs
then
october
people
were
born
with
original
ideas
and
loved
moving
you
could
have
summed
up
mary
little
jaunt
more
neatly
february
people
had
wonderful
memories
mary
speciality
we
took
a
bit
of
a
rest
then
had
another
go
at
the
thing
bobbie
was
all
for
may
because
the
book
said
that
women
born
in
that
month
were
inclined
to
be
capricious
which
is
always
a
barrier
to
a
happy
married
life
but
i
plumped
for
february
because
february
women
are
unusually
determined
to
have
their
own
way
are
very
earnest
and
expect
a
full
return
in
their
companion
or
mates
which
he
owned
was
about
as
like
mary
as
anything
could
be
in
the
end
he
tore
the
books
up
stamped
on
them
burnt
them
and
went
home
it
was
wonderful
what
a
change
the
next
few
days
made
in
dear
old
bobbie
have
you
ever
seen
that
picture
the
soul
awakening
it
represents
a
flapper
of
sorts
gazing
in
a
startled
sort
of
way
into
the
middle
distance
with
a
look
in
her
eyes
that
seems
to
say
surely
that
is
george
step
i
hear
on
the
mat
can
this
be
love
well
bobbie
had
a
soul
awakening
too
i
do
suppose
he
had
ever
troubled
to
think
in
his
life
before
not
really
but
now
he
was
wearing
his
brain
to
the
bone
it
was
painful
in
a
way
of
course
to
see
a
fellow
human
being
so
thoroughly
in
the
soup
but
i
felt
strongly
that
it
was
all
for
the
best
i
could
see
as
plainly
as
possible
that
all
these
brainstorms
were
improving
bobbie
out
of
knowledge
when
it
was
all
over
he
might
possibly
become
a
rotter
again
of
a
sort
but
it
would
only
be
a
pale
reflection
of
the
rotter
he
had
been
it
bore
out
the
idea
i
had
always
had
that
what
he
needed
was
a
real
good
jolt
i
saw
a
great
deal
of
him
these
days
i
was
his
best
friend
and
he
came
to
me
for
sympathy
i
gave
it
him
too
with
both
hands
but
i
never
failed
to
hand
him
the
moral
lesson
when
i
had
him
weak
one
day
he
came
to
me
as
i
was
sitting
in
the
club
and
i
could
see
that
he
had
had
an
idea
he
looked
happier
than
he
had
done
in
weeks
reggie
he
said
i
on
the
trail
this
time
i
convinced
that
i
shall
pull
it
off
i
remembered
something
of
vital
importance
yes
i
said
i
remember
distinctly
he
said
that
on
mary
last
birthday
we
went
together
to
the
coliseum
how
does
that
hit
you
it
a
fine
bit
of
memorizing
i
said
but
how
does
it
help
why
they
change
the
programme
every
week
there
ah
i
said
now
you
are
talking
and
the
week
we
went
one
of
the
turns
was
professor
some
terpsichorean
cats
i
recollect
them
distinctly
now
are
we
narrowing
it
down
or
are
we
reggie
i
going
round
to
the
coliseum
this
minute
and
i
going
to
dig
the
date
of
those
terpsichorean
cats
out
of
them
if
i
have
to
use
a
crowbar
so
that
got
him
within
six
days
for
the
management
treated
us
like
brothers
brought
out
the
archives
and
ran
agile
fingers
over
the
pages
till
they
treed
the
cats
in
the
middle
of
may
i
told
you
it
was
may
said
bobbie
maybe
you
listen
to
me
another
time
if
you
any
sense
i
said
there
wo
be
another
time
and
bobbie
said
that
there
would
once
you
get
your
memory
on
the
run
it
parts
as
if
it
enjoyed
doing
it
i
had
just
got
off
to
sleep
that
night
when
my
rang
it
was
bobbie
of
course
he
did
apologize
reggie
he
said
i
got
it
now
for
certain
it
just
come
to
me
we
saw
those
terpsichorean
cats
at
a
matinee
old
man
yes
i
said
well
do
you
see
that
that
brings
it
down
to
two
days
it
must
have
been
either
wednesday
the
seventh
or
saturday
the
tenth
yes
i
said
if
they
did
have
daily
matinees
at
the
coliseum
i
heard
him
give
a
sort
of
howl
bobbie
i
said
my
feet
were
freezing
but
i
was
fond
of
him
well
i
remembered
something
too
it
this
the
day
you
went
to
the
coliseum
i
lunched
with
you
both
at
the
ritz
you
had
forgotten
to
bring
any
money
with
you
so
you
wrote
a
cheque
but
i
always
writing
cheques
you
are
but
this
was
for
a
tenner
and
made
out
to
the
hotel
hunt
up
your
and
see
how
many
cheques
for
ten
pounds
payable
to
the
ritz
hotel
you
wrote
out
between
may
the
fifth
and
may
the
tenth
he
gave
a
kind
of
gulp
reggie
he
said
you
a
genius
i
always
said
so
i
believe
you
got
it
hold
the
line
presently
he
came
back
again
halloa
he
said
i
here
i
said
it
was
the
eighth
reggie
old
man
i
topping
i
said
good
night
it
was
working
along
into
the
small
hours
now
but
i
thought
i
might
as
well
make
a
night
of
it
and
finish
the
thing
up
so
i
rang
up
an
hotel
near
the
strand
put
me
through
to
cardew
i
said
it
late
said
the
man
at
the
other
end
and
getting
later
every
minute
i
said
buck
along
laddie
i
waited
patiently
i
had
missed
my
and
my
feet
had
frozen
hard
but
i
was
past
regrets
what
is
the
matter
said
mary
voice
my
feet
are
cold
i
said
but
i
did
call
you
up
to
tell
you
that
particularly
i
just
been
chatting
with
bobbie
mrs
cardew
oh
is
that
mr
pepper
yes
he
remembered
it
mrs
cardew
she
gave
a
sort
of
scream
i
often
thought
how
interesting
it
must
be
to
be
one
of
those
exchange
girls
the
things
they
must
hear
you
know
bobbie
howl
and
gulp
and
bobbie
scream
and
all
about
my
feet
and
all
that
most
interesting
it
must
be
he
remembered
it
she
gasped
did
you
tell
him
no
well
i
had
mr
pepper
yes
was
he
has
he
been
was
he
very
worried
i
chuckled
this
was
where
i
was
billed
to
be
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
worried
he
was
about
the
most
worried
man
between
here
and
edinburgh
he
has
been
worrying
as
if
he
was
paid
to
do
it
by
the
nation
he
has
started
out
to
worry
after
breakfast
and
oh
well
you
can
never
tell
with
women
my
idea
was
that
we
should
pass
the
rest
of
the
night
slapping
each
other
on
the
back
across
the
wire
and
telling
each
other
what
bally
brainy
conspirators
we
were
do
you
know
and
all
that
but
i
got
just
as
far
as
this
when
she
bit
at
me
absolutely
i
heard
the
snap
and
then
she
said
oh
in
that
choked
kind
of
way
and
when
a
woman
says
oh
like
that
it
means
all
the
bad
words
she
love
to
say
if
she
only
knew
them
and
then
she
began
what
brutes
men
are
what
horrid
brutes
how
you
could
stand
by
and
see
poor
dear
bobbie
worrying
himself
into
a
fever
when
a
word
from
you
would
have
put
everything
right
i
ca
but
and
you
call
yourself
his
friend
his
friend
metallic
laugh
most
unpleasant
it
shows
how
one
can
be
deceived
i
used
to
think
you
a
man
but
i
say
when
i
suggested
the
thing
you
thought
it
perfectly
i
thought
it
hateful
abominable
but
you
said
it
was
absolutely
top
i
said
nothing
of
the
kind
and
if
i
did
i
did
mean
it
i
wish
to
be
unjust
pepper
but
i
must
say
that
to
me
there
seems
to
be
something
positively
fiendish
in
a
man
who
can
go
out
of
his
way
to
separate
a
husband
from
his
wife
simply
in
order
to
amuse
himself
by
gloating
over
his
agony
but
when
one
single
word
would
have
but
you
made
me
promise
not
to
i
bleated
and
if
i
did
do
you
suppose
i
did
expect
you
to
have
the
sense
to
break
your
promise
i
had
finished
i
had
no
further
observations
to
make
i
hung
up
the
receiver
and
crawled
into
bed
i
still
see
bobbie
when
he
comes
to
the
club
but
i
do
not
visit
the
old
homestead
he
is
friendly
but
he
stops
short
of
issuing
invitations
i
ran
across
mary
at
the
academy
last
week
and
her
eyes
went
through
me
like
a
couple
of
bullets
through
a
pat
of
butter
and
as
they
came
out
the
other
side
and
i
limped
off
to
piece
myself
together
again
there
occurred
to
me
the
simple
epitaph
which
when
i
am
no
more
i
intend
to
have
inscribed
on
my
tombstone
it
was
this
he
was
a
man
who
acted
from
the
best
motives
there
is
one
born
every
minute
helping
freddie
i
do
want
to
bore
you
do
you
know
and
all
that
sort
of
rot
but
i
must
tell
you
about
dear
old
freddie
meadowes
i
not
a
flier
at
literary
style
and
all
that
but
i
get
some
writer
chappie
to
give
the
thing
a
wash
and
brush
up
when
i
finished
so
that
be
all
right
dear
old
freddie
do
you
know
has
been
a
dear
old
pal
of
mine
for
years
and
years
so
when
i
went
into
the
club
one
morning
and
found
him
sitting
alone
in
a
dark
corner
staring
glassily
at
nothing
and
generally
looking
like
the
last
rose
of
summer
you
can
understand
i
was
quite
disturbed
about
it
as
a
rule
the
old
rotter
is
the
life
and
soul
of
our
set
quite
the
little
lump
of
fun
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
jimmy
pinkerton
was
with
me
at
the
time
jimmy
a
fellow
who
writes
plays
a
deuced
brainy
sort
of
fellow
and
between
us
we
set
to
work
to
question
the
poor
chappie
until
finally
we
got
at
what
the
matter
was
as
we
might
have
guessed
it
was
a
girl
he
had
had
a
quarrel
with
angela
west
the
girl
he
was
engaged
to
and
she
had
broken
off
the
engagement
what
the
row
had
been
about
he
did
say
but
apparently
she
was
pretty
well
fed
up
she
would
let
him
come
near
her
refused
to
talk
on
the
phone
and
sent
back
his
letters
unopened
i
was
sorry
for
poor
old
freddie
i
knew
what
it
felt
like
i
was
once
in
love
myself
with
a
girl
called
elizabeth
shoolbred
and
the
fact
that
she
could
stand
me
at
any
price
will
be
recorded
in
my
autobiography
i
knew
the
thing
for
freddie
change
of
scene
is
what
you
want
old
scout
i
said
come
with
me
to
marvis
bay
i
taken
a
cottage
there
jimmy
coming
down
on
the
we
be
a
cosy
party
he
absolutely
right
said
jimmy
change
of
scene
the
thing
i
knew
a
man
girl
refused
him
man
went
abroad
two
months
later
girl
wired
him
back
muriel
man
started
to
write
out
a
reply
suddenly
found
that
he
could
remember
girl
surname
so
never
answered
at
all
but
freddie
would
be
comforted
he
just
went
on
looking
as
if
he
had
swallowed
his
last
sixpence
however
i
got
him
to
promise
to
come
to
marvis
bay
with
me
he
said
he
might
as
well
be
there
as
anywhere
do
you
know
marvis
bay
it
in
dorsetshire
it
is
what
you
call
a
fiercely
exciting
spot
but
it
has
its
good
points
you
spend
the
day
there
bathing
and
sitting
on
the
sands
and
in
the
evening
you
stroll
out
on
the
shore
with
the
gnats
at
nine
you
rub
ointment
on
the
wounds
and
go
to
bed
it
seemed
to
suit
poor
old
freddie
once
the
moon
was
up
and
the
breeze
sighing
in
the
trees
you
could
drag
him
from
that
beach
with
a
rope
he
became
quite
a
popular
pet
with
the
gnats
they
hang
round
waiting
for
him
to
come
out
and
would
give
perfectly
good
strollers
the
just
so
as
to
be
in
good
condition
for
him
yes
it
was
a
peaceful
sort
of
life
but
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
i
began
to
wish
that
jimmy
pinkerton
had
arranged
to
come
down
earlier
for
as
a
companion
freddie
poor
old
chap
was
anything
to
write
home
to
mother
about
when
he
was
chewing
a
pipe
and
scowling
at
the
carpet
he
was
sitting
at
the
piano
playing
the
rosary
with
one
finger
he
could
play
anything
except
the
rosary
and
he
play
much
of
that
somewhere
round
about
the
third
bar
a
fuse
would
blow
out
and
he
have
to
start
all
over
again
he
was
playing
it
as
usual
one
morning
when
i
came
in
from
bathing
reggie
he
said
in
a
hollow
voice
looking
up
i
seen
her
seen
her
i
said
what
miss
west
i
was
down
at
the
post
office
getting
the
letters
and
we
met
in
the
doorway
she
cut
me
he
started
the
rosary
again
and
in
the
second
bar
reggie
he
said
you
ought
never
to
have
brought
me
here
i
must
go
away
go
away
i
said
do
talk
such
rot
this
is
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
this
is
where
you
come
out
strong
she
cut
me
never
mind
be
a
sportsman
have
another
dash
at
her
she
looked
clean
through
me
of
course
she
did
but
do
mind
that
put
this
thing
in
my
hands
i
see
you
through
now
what
you
want
i
said
is
to
place
her
under
some
obligation
to
you
what
you
want
is
to
get
her
timidly
thanking
you
what
you
want
but
what
she
going
to
thank
me
timidly
for
i
thought
for
a
moment
look
out
for
a
chance
and
save
her
from
drowning
i
said
i
ca
swim
said
freddie
that
was
freddie
all
over
do
you
know
a
dear
old
chap
in
a
thousand
ways
but
no
help
to
a
fellow
if
you
know
what
i
mean
he
cranked
up
the
piano
once
more
and
i
sprinted
for
the
open
i
strolled
out
on
to
the
sands
and
began
to
think
this
thing
over
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
had
got
to
be
done
by
me
dear
old
freddie
had
his
strong
qualities
he
was
at
polo
and
in
happier
days
i
heard
him
give
an
imitation
of
cats
fighting
in
a
backyard
that
would
have
surprised
you
but
apart
from
that
he
was
a
man
of
enterprise
well
do
you
know
i
was
rounding
some
rocks
with
my
brain
whirring
like
a
dynamo
when
i
caught
sight
of
a
blue
dress
and
by
jove
it
was
the
girl
i
had
never
met
her
but
freddie
had
sixteen
photographs
of
her
sprinkled
round
his
bedroom
and
i
knew
i
could
be
mistaken
she
was
sitting
on
the
sand
helping
a
small
fat
child
build
a
castle
on
a
chair
close
by
was
an
elderly
lady
reading
a
novel
i
heard
the
girl
call
her
aunt
so
doing
the
sherlock
holmes
business
i
deduced
that
the
fat
child
was
her
cousin
it
struck
me
that
if
freddie
had
been
there
he
would
probably
have
tried
to
work
up
some
sentiment
about
the
kid
on
the
strength
of
it
personally
i
could
manage
it
i
think
i
ever
saw
a
child
who
made
me
feel
less
sentimental
he
was
one
of
those
round
bulging
kids
after
he
had
finished
the
castle
he
seemed
to
get
bored
with
life
and
began
to
whimper
the
girl
took
him
off
to
where
a
fellow
was
selling
sweets
at
a
stall
and
i
walked
on
now
fellows
if
you
ask
them
will
tell
you
that
i
a
chump
well
i
do
mind
i
admit
it
i
a
chump
all
the
peppers
have
been
chumps
but
what
i
do
say
is
that
every
now
and
then
when
you
least
expect
it
i
get
a
pretty
hot
and
that
what
happened
now
i
doubt
if
the
idea
that
came
to
me
then
would
have
occurred
to
a
single
one
of
any
dozen
of
the
brainiest
chappies
you
care
to
name
it
came
to
me
on
my
return
journey
i
was
walking
back
along
the
shore
when
i
saw
the
fat
kid
meditatively
smacking
a
with
a
spade
the
girl
was
with
him
in
fact
there
did
seem
to
be
any
one
in
sight
i
was
just
going
to
pass
on
when
i
got
the
i
thought
the
whole
thing
out
in
a
flash
do
you
know
from
what
i
had
seen
of
the
two
the
girl
was
evidently
fond
of
this
kid
and
anyhow
he
was
her
cousin
so
what
i
said
to
myself
was
this
if
i
kidnap
this
young
for
the
moment
and
if
when
the
girl
has
got
frightfully
anxious
about
where
he
can
have
got
to
dear
old
freddie
suddenly
appears
leading
the
infant
by
the
hand
and
telling
a
story
to
the
effect
that
he
has
found
him
wandering
at
large
about
the
country
and
practically
saved
his
life
why
the
girl
gratitude
is
bound
to
make
her
chuck
hostilities
and
be
friends
again
so
i
gathered
in
the
kid
and
made
off
with
him
all
the
way
home
i
pictured
that
scene
of
reconciliation
i
could
see
it
so
vividly
do
you
know
that
by
george
it
gave
me
quite
a
choky
feeling
in
my
throat
freddie
dear
old
chap
was
rather
slow
at
getting
on
to
the
fine
points
of
the
idea
when
i
appeared
carrying
the
kid
and
dumped
him
down
in
our
he
did
absolutely
effervesce
with
joy
if
you
know
what
i
mean
the
kid
had
started
to
bellow
by
this
time
and
poor
old
freddie
seemed
to
find
it
rather
trying
stop
it
he
said
do
you
think
nobody
got
any
troubles
except
you
what
the
deuce
is
all
this
reggie
the
kid
came
back
at
him
with
a
yell
that
made
the
window
rattle
i
raced
to
the
kitchen
and
fetched
a
jar
of
honey
it
was
the
right
stuff
the
kid
stopped
bellowing
and
began
to
smear
his
face
with
the
stuff
well
said
freddie
when
silence
had
set
in
i
explained
the
idea
after
a
while
it
began
to
strike
him
you
not
such
a
fool
as
you
look
sometimes
reggie
he
said
handsomely
i
bound
to
say
this
seems
pretty
good
and
he
disentangled
the
kid
from
the
and
took
him
out
to
scour
the
beach
for
angela
i
do
know
when
i
felt
so
happy
i
was
so
fond
of
dear
old
freddie
that
to
know
that
he
was
soon
going
to
be
his
old
bright
self
again
made
me
feel
as
if
somebody
had
left
me
about
a
million
pounds
i
was
leaning
back
in
a
chair
on
the
veranda
smoking
peacefully
when
down
the
road
i
saw
the
old
boy
returning
and
by
george
the
kid
was
still
with
him
and
freddie
looked
as
if
he
had
a
friend
in
the
world
hello
i
said
could
you
find
her
yes
i
found
her
he
replied
with
one
of
those
bitter
hollow
laughs
well
then
freddie
sank
into
a
chair
and
groaned
this
is
her
cousin
you
idiot
he
said
he
no
relation
at
all
he
just
a
kid
she
happened
to
meet
on
the
beach
she
had
never
seen
him
before
in
her
life
what
who
is
he
then
i
do
know
oh
lord
i
had
a
time
thank
goodness
probably
spend
the
next
few
years
of
your
life
in
dartmoor
for
kidnapping
that
my
only
consolation
i
come
and
jeer
at
you
through
the
bars
tell
me
all
old
boy
i
said
it
took
him
a
good
long
time
to
tell
the
story
for
he
broke
off
in
the
middle
of
nearly
every
sentence
to
call
me
names
but
i
gathered
gradually
what
had
happened
she
had
listened
like
an
iceberg
while
he
told
the
story
he
had
prepared
and
then
well
she
did
actually
call
him
a
liar
but
she
gave
him
to
understand
in
a
general
sort
of
way
that
if
he
and
cook
ever
happened
to
meet
and
started
swapping
stories
it
would
be
about
the
biggest
duel
on
record
and
then
he
had
crawled
away
with
the
kid
licked
to
a
splinter
and
mind
this
is
your
affair
he
concluded
i
not
mixed
up
in
it
at
all
if
you
want
to
escape
your
sentence
you
better
go
and
find
the
kid
parents
and
return
him
before
the
police
come
for
you
by
jove
you
know
till
i
started
to
tramp
the
place
with
this
infernal
kid
i
never
had
a
notion
it
would
have
been
so
deuced
difficult
to
restore
a
child
to
its
anxious
parents
it
a
mystery
to
me
how
kidnappers
ever
get
caught
i
searched
marvis
bay
like
a
bloodhound
but
nobody
came
forward
to
claim
the
infant
you
have
thought
from
the
lack
of
interest
in
him
that
he
was
stopping
there
all
by
himself
in
a
cottage
of
his
own
it
was
till
by
an
inspiration
i
thought
to
ask
the
man
that
i
found
out
that
his
name
was
medwin
and
that
his
parents
lived
at
a
place
called
ocean
rest
in
beach
road
i
shot
off
there
like
an
arrow
and
knocked
at
the
door
nobody
answered
i
knocked
again
i
could
hear
movements
inside
but
nobody
came
i
was
just
going
to
get
to
work
on
that
knocker
in
such
a
way
that
the
idea
would
filter
through
into
these
people
heads
that
i
was
standing
there
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
when
a
voice
from
somewhere
above
shouted
hi
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
round
pink
face
with
grey
whiskers
east
and
west
of
it
staring
down
from
an
upper
window
hi
it
shouted
again
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
by
i
said
you
ca
come
in
said
the
face
hello
is
that
tootles
my
name
is
not
tootles
and
i
do
want
to
come
in
i
said
are
you
medwin
i
brought
back
your
son
i
see
him
tootles
dadda
can
see
the
face
disappeared
with
a
jerk
i
could
hear
voices
the
face
reappeared
hi
i
churned
the
gravel
madly
do
you
live
here
said
the
face
i
staying
here
for
a
few
weeks
what
your
name
pepper
but
pepper
any
relation
to
edward
pepper
the
colliery
owner
my
uncle
but
i
used
to
know
him
well
dear
old
edward
pepper
i
wish
i
was
with
him
now
i
wish
you
were
i
said
he
beamed
down
at
me
this
is
most
fortunate
he
said
we
were
wondering
what
we
were
to
do
with
tootles
you
see
we
have
the
mumps
here
my
daughter
bootles
has
just
developed
mumps
tootles
must
not
be
exposed
to
the
risk
of
infection
we
could
not
think
what
we
were
to
do
with
him
it
was
most
fortunate
your
finding
him
he
strayed
from
his
nurse
i
would
hesitate
to
trust
him
to
the
care
of
a
stranger
but
you
are
different
any
nephew
of
edward
pepper
has
my
implicit
confidence
you
must
take
tootles
to
your
house
it
will
be
an
ideal
arrangement
i
have
written
to
my
brother
in
london
to
come
and
fetch
him
he
may
be
here
in
a
few
days
may
he
is
a
busy
man
of
course
but
he
should
certainly
be
here
within
a
week
till
then
tootles
can
stop
with
you
it
is
an
excellent
plan
very
much
obliged
to
you
your
wife
will
like
tootles
i
have
got
a
wife
i
yelled
but
the
window
had
closed
with
a
bang
as
if
the
man
with
the
whiskers
had
found
a
germ
trying
to
escape
do
you
know
and
had
headed
it
off
just
in
time
i
breathed
a
deep
breath
and
wiped
my
forehead
the
window
flew
up
again
hi
a
package
weighing
about
a
ton
hit
me
on
the
head
and
burst
like
a
bomb
did
you
catch
it
said
the
face
reappearing
dear
me
you
missed
it
never
mind
you
can
get
it
at
the
grocer
ask
for
granulated
breakfast
chips
tootles
takes
them
for
breakfast
with
a
little
milk
be
certain
to
get
bailey
my
spirit
was
broken
if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
accepted
the
situation
taking
tootles
by
the
hand
i
walked
slowly
away
napoleon
retreat
from
moscow
was
a
picnic
by
the
side
of
it
as
we
turned
up
the
road
we
met
freddie
angela
the
sight
of
her
had
a
marked
effect
on
the
kid
tootles
he
pointed
at
her
and
said
wah
the
girl
stopped
and
smiled
i
loosed
the
kid
and
he
ran
to
her
well
baby
she
said
bending
down
to
him
so
father
found
you
again
did
he
your
little
son
and
i
made
friends
on
the
beach
this
morning
she
said
to
me
this
was
the
limit
coming
on
top
of
that
interview
with
the
whiskered
lunatic
it
so
utterly
unnerved
me
do
you
know
that
she
had
nodded
and
was
down
the
road
before
i
caught
up
with
my
breath
enough
to
deny
the
charge
of
being
the
infant
father
i
had
expected
dear
old
freddie
to
sing
with
joy
when
he
found
out
what
had
happened
but
i
did
think
he
might
have
shown
a
little
more
manly
fortitude
he
leaped
up
glared
at
the
kid
and
clutched
his
head
he
did
speak
for
a
long
time
but
on
the
other
hand
when
he
began
he
did
not
leave
off
for
a
long
time
he
was
quite
emotional
dear
old
boy
it
beat
me
where
he
could
have
picked
up
such
expressions
well
he
said
when
he
had
finished
say
something
heavens
man
why
do
you
say
something
you
do
give
me
a
chance
old
top
i
said
soothingly
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
what
can
we
do
about
it
we
ca
spend
our
time
acting
as
nurses
to
this
this
exhibit
he
got
up
i
going
back
to
london
he
said
freddie
i
cried
freddie
old
man
my
voice
shook
would
you
desert
a
pal
at
a
time
like
this
i
would
this
is
your
business
and
you
got
to
manage
it
freddie
i
said
you
got
to
stand
by
me
you
must
do
you
realize
that
this
child
has
to
be
undressed
and
bathed
and
dressed
again
you
would
leave
me
to
do
all
that
freddie
old
scout
we
were
at
school
together
your
mother
likes
me
you
owe
me
a
tenner
he
sat
down
again
oh
well
he
said
resignedly
besides
old
top
i
said
i
did
it
all
for
your
sake
do
you
know
he
looked
at
me
in
a
curious
way
reggie
he
said
in
a
strained
voice
one
moment
i
stand
a
good
deal
but
i
wo
stand
for
being
expected
to
be
grateful
looking
back
at
it
i
see
that
what
saved
me
from
colney
hatch
in
that
crisis
was
my
bright
idea
of
buying
up
most
of
the
contents
of
the
local
by
serving
out
sweets
to
the
kid
practically
incessantly
we
managed
to
get
through
the
rest
of
that
day
pretty
satisfactorily
at
eight
he
fell
asleep
in
a
chair
and
having
undressed
him
by
unbuttoning
every
button
in
sight
and
where
there
were
no
buttons
pulling
till
something
gave
we
carried
him
up
to
bed
freddie
stood
looking
at
the
pile
of
clothes
on
the
floor
and
i
knew
what
he
was
thinking
to
get
the
kid
undressed
had
been
simple
a
mere
matter
of
muscle
but
how
were
we
to
get
him
into
his
clothes
again
i
stirred
the
pile
with
my
foot
there
was
a
long
linen
arrangement
which
might
have
been
anything
also
a
strip
of
pink
flannel
which
was
like
nothing
on
earth
we
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
wanly
but
in
the
morning
i
remembered
that
there
were
children
at
the
next
bungalow
but
one
we
went
there
before
breakfast
and
borrowed
their
nurse
women
are
wonderful
by
george
they
are
she
had
that
kid
dressed
and
looking
fit
for
anything
in
about
eight
minutes
i
showered
wealth
on
her
and
she
promised
to
come
in
morning
and
evening
i
sat
down
to
breakfast
almost
cheerful
again
it
was
the
first
bit
of
silver
lining
there
had
been
to
the
cloud
up
to
date
and
after
all
i
said
there
lots
to
be
said
for
having
a
child
about
the
house
if
you
know
what
i
mean
kind
of
cosy
and
domestic
what
just
then
the
kid
upset
the
milk
over
freddie
trousers
and
when
he
had
come
back
after
changing
his
clothes
he
began
to
talk
about
what
a
man
king
herod
was
the
more
he
saw
of
tootles
he
said
the
less
he
wondered
at
those
impulsive
views
of
his
on
infanticide
two
days
later
jimmy
pinkerton
came
down
jimmy
took
one
look
at
the
kid
who
happened
to
be
howling
at
the
moment
and
picked
up
his
portmanteau
for
me
he
said
the
hotel
i
ca
write
dialogue
with
that
sort
of
thing
going
on
whose
work
is
this
which
of
you
adopted
this
little
treasure
i
told
him
about
medwin
and
the
mumps
jimmy
seemed
interested
i
might
work
this
up
for
the
stage
he
said
it
would
make
a
bad
situation
for
act
two
of
a
farce
farce
snarled
poor
old
freddie
rather
curtain
of
act
one
on
hero
a
sort
of
idiot
just
like
that
is
to
say
a
sort
of
idiot
kidnapping
the
child
second
act
his
adventures
with
it
rough
it
out
come
along
and
show
me
the
hotel
reggie
as
we
went
i
told
him
the
rest
of
the
story
the
angela
part
he
laid
down
his
portmanteau
and
looked
at
me
like
an
owl
through
his
glasses
what
he
said
why
hang
it
this
is
a
play
it
the
old
hand
business
always
safe
stuff
parted
lovers
lisping
child
reconciliation
over
the
little
cradle
it
big
child
centre
girl
freddie
up
stage
by
the
piano
can
freddie
play
the
piano
he
can
play
a
little
of
rosary
with
one
finger
jimmy
shook
his
head
no
we
shall
have
to
cut
out
the
soft
music
but
the
rest
all
right
look
here
he
squatted
in
the
sand
this
stone
is
the
girl
this
bit
of
seaweed
the
child
this
nutshell
is
freddie
dialogue
leading
up
to
child
line
child
speaks
like
lady
does
love
dadda
business
of
outstretched
hands
hold
picture
for
a
moment
freddie
crosses
takes
girl
hand
business
of
swallowing
lump
in
throat
then
big
speech
marie
or
whatever
her
name
is
jane
agnes
angela
very
well
angela
has
not
this
gone
on
too
long
a
little
child
rebukes
us
angela
and
so
on
freddie
must
work
up
his
own
part
i
just
giving
you
the
general
outline
and
we
must
get
a
good
line
for
the
child
lady
does
love
dadda
is
definite
enough
we
want
something
more
ah
freddie
that
it
short
crisp
and
has
the
punch
but
jimmy
old
top
i
said
the
only
objection
is
do
you
know
that
there
no
way
of
getting
the
girl
to
the
cottage
she
cuts
freddie
she
would
come
within
a
mile
of
him
jimmy
frowned
that
awkward
he
said
well
we
shall
have
to
make
it
an
exterior
set
instead
of
an
interior
we
can
easily
corner
her
on
the
beach
somewhere
when
we
ready
meanwhile
we
must
get
the
kid
first
rehearsal
for
lines
and
business
eleven
sharp
poor
old
freddie
was
in
such
a
gloomy
state
of
mind
that
we
decided
not
to
tell
him
the
idea
till
we
had
finished
coaching
the
kid
he
in
the
mood
to
have
a
thing
like
that
hanging
over
him
so
we
concentrated
on
tootles
and
pretty
early
in
the
proceedings
we
saw
that
the
only
way
to
get
tootles
worked
up
to
the
spirit
of
the
thing
was
to
introduce
sweets
of
some
sort
as
a
so
to
speak
the
chief
difficulty
said
jimmy
pinkerton
at
the
end
of
the
first
rehearsal
is
to
establish
a
connection
in
the
kid
mind
between
his
line
and
the
sweets
once
he
has
grasped
the
basic
fact
that
those
two
words
clearly
spoken
result
automatically
in
we
have
got
a
success
i
often
thought
do
you
know
how
interesting
it
must
be
to
be
one
of
those
johnnies
to
stimulate
the
dawning
intelligence
and
that
sort
of
thing
well
this
was
every
bit
as
exciting
some
days
success
seemed
to
be
staring
us
in
the
eye
and
the
kid
got
the
line
out
as
if
he
been
an
old
professional
and
then
go
all
to
pieces
again
and
time
was
flying
we
must
hurry
up
jimmy
i
said
the
kid
uncle
may
arrive
any
day
now
and
take
him
away
and
we
have
an
understudy
said
jimmy
there
something
in
that
we
must
work
my
goodness
that
kid
a
bad
study
i
known
who
would
have
learned
the
part
quicker
i
will
say
this
for
the
kid
though
he
was
a
trier
failure
discourage
him
whenever
there
was
any
kind
of
sweet
near
he
had
a
dash
at
his
line
and
kept
on
saying
something
till
he
got
what
he
was
after
his
only
fault
was
his
uncertainty
personally
i
would
have
been
prepared
to
risk
it
and
start
the
performance
at
the
first
opportunity
but
jimmy
said
no
we
not
nearly
ready
said
jimmy
for
instance
he
said
freddie
that
not
going
to
win
any
girl
heart
and
she
might
do
it
too
no
we
must
postpone
production
awhile
yet
but
by
george
we
did
the
curtain
went
up
the
very
next
afternoon
it
was
nobody
fault
certainly
not
mine
it
was
just
fate
freddie
had
settled
down
at
the
piano
and
i
was
leading
the
kid
out
of
the
house
to
exercise
it
when
just
as
we
got
out
to
the
veranda
along
came
the
girl
angela
on
her
way
to
the
beach
the
kid
set
up
his
usual
yell
at
the
sight
of
her
and
she
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
hello
baby
she
said
good
morning
she
said
to
me
may
i
come
up
she
did
wait
for
an
answer
she
just
came
she
seemed
to
be
that
sort
of
girl
she
came
up
on
the
veranda
and
started
fussing
over
the
kid
and
six
feet
away
mind
you
freddie
smiting
the
piano
in
the
it
was
a
dash
disturbing
situation
do
you
know
at
any
minute
freddie
might
take
it
into
his
head
to
come
out
on
to
the
veranda
and
we
had
even
begun
to
rehearse
him
in
his
part
i
tried
to
break
up
the
scene
we
were
just
going
down
to
the
beach
i
said
yes
said
the
girl
she
listened
for
a
moment
so
you
having
your
piano
tuned
she
said
my
aunt
has
been
trying
to
find
a
tuner
for
ours
do
you
mind
if
i
go
in
and
tell
this
man
to
come
on
to
us
when
he
finished
here
er
not
yet
i
said
not
yet
if
you
do
mind
he
ca
bear
to
be
disturbed
when
he
working
it
the
artistic
temperament
i
tell
him
later
very
well
she
said
getting
up
to
go
ask
him
to
call
at
pine
bungalow
west
is
the
name
oh
he
seems
to
have
stopped
i
suppose
he
will
be
out
in
a
minute
now
i
wait
do
you
think
should
we
be
going
on
to
the
beach
i
said
she
had
started
talking
to
the
kid
and
did
hear
she
was
feeling
in
her
pocket
for
something
the
beach
i
babbled
see
what
i
brought
for
you
baby
she
said
and
by
george
you
know
she
held
up
in
front
of
the
kid
bulging
eyes
a
chunk
of
toffee
about
the
size
of
the
automobile
club
that
finished
it
we
had
just
been
having
a
long
rehearsal
and
the
kid
was
all
worked
up
in
his
part
he
got
it
right
first
time
kiss
fweddie
he
shouted
and
the
front
door
opened
and
freddie
came
out
on
to
the
veranda
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
had
been
taking
a
cue
he
looked
at
the
girl
and
the
girl
looked
at
him
i
looked
at
the
ground
and
the
kid
looked
at
the
toffee
kiss
fweddie
he
yelled
kiss
fweddie
the
girl
was
still
holding
up
the
toffee
and
the
kid
did
what
jimmy
pinkerton
would
have
called
business
of
outstretched
hands
towards
it
kiss
fweddie
he
shrieked
what
does
this
mean
said
the
girl
turning
to
me
you
better
give
it
to
him
do
you
know
i
said
he
go
on
till
you
do
she
gave
the
kid
his
toffee
and
he
subsided
poor
old
freddie
still
stood
there
gaping
without
a
word
what
does
it
mean
said
the
girl
again
her
face
was
pink
and
her
eyes
were
sparkling
in
the
sort
of
way
do
you
know
that
makes
a
fellow
feel
as
if
he
had
any
bones
in
him
if
you
know
what
i
mean
did
you
ever
tread
on
your
partner
dress
at
a
dance
and
tear
it
and
see
her
smile
at
you
like
an
angel
and
say
do
apologize
it
nothing
and
then
suddenly
meet
her
clear
blue
eyes
and
feel
as
if
you
had
stepped
on
the
teeth
of
a
rake
and
had
the
handle
jump
up
and
hit
you
in
the
face
well
that
how
freddie
angela
looked
she
said
and
her
teeth
gave
a
little
click
i
gulped
then
i
said
it
was
nothing
then
i
said
it
was
nothing
much
then
i
said
oh
well
it
was
this
way
and
after
a
few
brief
remarks
about
jimmy
pinkerton
i
told
her
all
about
it
and
all
the
while
idiot
freddie
stood
there
gaping
without
a
word
and
the
girl
did
speak
either
she
just
stood
listening
and
then
she
began
to
laugh
i
never
heard
a
girl
laugh
so
much
she
leaned
against
the
side
of
the
veranda
and
shrieked
and
all
the
while
freddie
the
world
champion
chump
stood
there
saying
nothing
well
i
sidled
towards
the
steps
i
had
said
all
i
had
to
say
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
about
here
the
exit
was
written
in
my
part
i
gave
poor
old
freddie
up
in
despair
if
only
he
had
said
a
word
it
might
have
been
all
right
but
there
he
stood
speechless
what
can
a
fellow
do
with
a
fellow
like
that
just
out
of
sight
of
the
house
i
met
jimmy
pinkerton
hello
reggie
he
said
i
was
just
coming
to
you
where
the
kid
we
must
have
a
big
rehearsal
no
good
i
said
sadly
it
all
over
the
thing
finished
poor
dear
old
freddie
has
made
an
ass
of
himself
and
killed
the
whole
show
tell
me
said
jimmy
i
told
him
fluffed
in
his
lines
did
he
said
jimmy
nodding
thoughtfully
always
the
way
with
these
amateurs
we
must
go
back
at
once
things
look
bad
but
it
may
not
be
too
late
he
said
as
we
started
even
now
a
few
words
from
a
man
of
the
world
and
great
scot
i
cried
look
in
front
of
the
cottage
stood
six
children
a
nurse
and
the
fellow
from
the
grocer
staring
from
the
windows
of
the
houses
opposite
projected
about
four
hundred
heads
of
both
sexes
staring
down
the
road
came
galloping
five
more
children
a
dog
three
men
and
a
boy
about
to
stare
and
on
our
porch
as
unconscious
of
the
spectators
as
if
they
had
been
alone
in
the
sahara
stood
freddie
and
angela
clasped
in
each
other
arms
dear
old
freddie
may
have
been
fluffy
in
his
lines
but
by
george
his
business
had
certainly
gone
with
a
bang
rallying
round
old
george
i
think
one
of
the
rummiest
affairs
i
was
ever
mixed
up
with
in
the
course
of
a
lifetime
devoted
to
butting
into
other
people
business
was
that
affair
of
george
lattaker
at
monte
carlo
i
would
bore
you
do
you
know
for
the
world
but
i
think
you
ought
to
hear
about
it
we
had
come
to
monte
carlo
on
the
yacht
belonging
to
an
old
sportsman
of
the
name
of
marshall
among
those
present
were
myself
my
man
voules
a
vanderley
her
daughter
stella
maid
pilbeam
and
george
george
was
a
dear
old
pal
of
mine
in
fact
it
was
i
who
had
worked
him
into
the
party
you
see
george
was
due
to
meet
his
uncle
augustus
who
was
scheduled
george
having
just
reached
his
birthday
to
hand
over
to
him
a
legacy
left
by
one
of
george
aunts
for
which
he
had
been
trustee
the
aunt
had
died
when
george
was
quite
a
kid
it
was
a
date
that
george
had
been
looking
forward
to
for
though
he
had
a
sort
of
income
an
income
is
only
an
income
whereas
a
chunk
of
o
goblins
is
a
pile
george
uncle
was
in
monte
carlo
and
had
written
george
that
he
would
come
to
london
and
unbelt
but
it
struck
me
that
a
far
better
plan
was
for
george
to
go
to
his
uncle
at
monte
carlo
instead
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
do
you
know
fix
up
his
affairs
and
have
a
pleasant
holiday
simultaneously
so
george
had
tagged
along
and
at
the
time
when
the
trouble
started
we
were
anchored
in
monaco
harbour
and
uncle
augustus
was
due
next
day
looking
back
i
may
say
that
so
far
as
i
was
mixed
up
in
it
the
thing
began
at
seven
in
the
morning
when
i
was
aroused
from
a
dreamless
sleep
by
the
dickens
of
a
scrap
in
progress
outside
my
door
the
chief
ingredients
were
a
female
voice
that
sobbed
and
said
oh
harold
and
a
male
voice
raised
in
anger
as
they
say
which
after
considerable
difficulty
i
identified
as
voules
i
hardly
recognized
it
in
his
official
capacity
voules
talks
exactly
like
expect
a
statue
to
talk
if
it
could
in
private
however
he
evidently
relaxed
to
some
extent
and
to
have
that
sort
of
thing
going
on
in
my
midst
at
that
hour
was
too
much
for
me
voules
i
yelled
spion
kop
ceased
with
a
jerk
there
was
silence
then
sobs
diminishing
in
the
distance
and
finally
a
tap
at
the
door
voules
entered
with
that
impressive
look
which
is
what
i
pay
him
for
you
would
have
believed
he
had
a
drop
of
any
sort
of
emotion
in
him
voules
i
said
are
you
under
the
delusion
that
i
going
to
be
queen
of
the
may
you
called
me
early
all
right
it
only
just
seven
i
understood
you
to
summon
me
sir
i
summoned
you
to
find
out
why
you
were
making
that
infernal
noise
outside
i
owe
you
an
apology
sir
i
am
afraid
that
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
i
raised
my
voice
it
a
wonder
you
did
raise
the
roof
who
was
that
with
you
miss
pilbeam
sir
vanderley
maid
what
was
all
the
trouble
about
i
was
breaking
our
engagement
sir
i
could
help
gaping
somehow
one
did
associate
voules
with
engagements
then
it
struck
me
that
i
no
right
to
butt
in
on
his
secret
sorrows
so
i
switched
the
conversation
i
think
i
get
up
i
said
yes
sir
i
ca
wait
to
breakfast
with
the
rest
can
you
get
me
some
right
away
yes
sir
so
i
had
a
solitary
breakfast
and
went
up
on
deck
to
smoke
it
was
a
lovely
morning
blue
sea
gleaming
casino
cloudless
sky
and
all
the
rest
of
the
hippodrome
presently
the
others
began
to
trickle
up
stella
vanderley
was
one
of
the
first
i
thought
she
looked
a
bit
pale
and
tired
she
said
she
had
slept
well
that
accounted
for
it
unless
you
get
your
eight
hours
where
are
you
seen
george
i
asked
i
could
help
thinking
the
name
seemed
to
freeze
her
a
bit
which
was
queer
because
all
the
voyage
she
and
george
had
been
particularly
close
pals
in
fact
at
any
moment
i
expected
george
to
come
to
me
and
slip
his
little
hand
in
mine
and
whisper
i
done
it
old
scout
she
loves
muh
i
have
not
seen
lattaker
she
said
i
did
pursue
the
subject
george
stock
was
apparently
low
that
the
next
item
in
the
day
programme
occurred
a
few
minutes
later
when
the
morning
papers
arrived
vanderley
opened
hers
and
gave
a
scream
the
poor
dear
prince
she
said
what
a
shocking
thing
said
old
marshall
i
knew
him
in
vienna
said
vanderley
he
waltzed
divinely
then
i
got
at
mine
and
saw
what
they
were
talking
about
the
paper
was
full
of
it
it
seemed
that
late
the
night
before
his
serene
highness
the
prince
of
i
always
wonder
why
they
call
these
chaps
serene
had
been
murderously
assaulted
in
a
dark
street
on
his
way
back
from
the
casino
to
his
yacht
apparently
he
had
developed
the
habit
of
going
about
without
an
escort
and
some
taking
advantage
of
this
had
laid
for
him
and
slugged
him
with
considerable
vim
the
prince
had
been
found
lying
pretty
well
beaten
up
and
insensible
in
the
street
by
a
passing
pedestrian
and
had
been
taken
back
to
his
yacht
where
he
still
lay
unconscious
this
is
going
to
do
somebody
no
good
i
said
what
do
you
get
for
slugging
a
serene
highness
i
wonder
if
they
catch
the
fellow
read
old
marshall
pedestrian
who
discovered
his
serene
highness
proves
to
have
been
denman
sturgis
the
eminent
private
investigator
sturgis
has
offered
his
services
to
the
police
and
is
understood
to
be
in
possession
of
a
most
important
clue
that
the
fellow
who
had
charge
of
that
kidnapping
case
in
chicago
if
anyone
can
catch
the
man
he
can
about
five
minutes
later
just
as
the
rest
of
them
were
going
to
move
off
to
breakfast
a
boat
hailed
us
and
came
alongside
a
tall
thin
man
came
up
the
gangway
he
looked
round
the
group
and
fixed
on
old
marshall
as
the
probable
owner
of
the
yacht
good
morning
he
said
i
believe
you
have
a
lattaker
on
board
george
lattaker
yes
said
marshall
he
down
below
want
to
see
him
whom
shall
i
say
he
would
not
know
my
name
i
should
like
to
see
him
for
a
moment
on
somewhat
urgent
business
take
a
seat
he
be
up
in
a
moment
reggie
my
boy
go
and
hurry
him
up
i
went
down
to
george
george
old
man
i
shouted
no
answer
i
opened
the
door
and
went
in
the
room
was
empty
more
the
bunk
had
been
slept
in
i
do
know
when
i
been
more
surprised
i
went
on
deck
he
is
there
i
said
not
there
said
old
marshall
where
is
he
then
perhaps
he
gone
for
a
stroll
ashore
but
he
be
back
soon
for
breakfast
you
better
wait
for
him
have
you
breakfasted
no
then
will
you
join
us
the
man
said
he
would
and
just
then
the
gong
went
and
they
trooped
down
leaving
me
alone
on
deck
i
sat
smoking
and
thinking
and
then
smoking
a
bit
more
when
i
thought
i
heard
somebody
call
my
name
in
a
sort
of
hoarse
whisper
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
and
by
jove
there
at
the
top
of
the
gangway
in
evening
dress
dusty
to
the
eyebrows
and
without
a
hat
was
dear
old
george
great
scot
i
cried
he
whispered
anyone
about
they
all
down
at
breakfast
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
sank
into
my
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
i
regarded
him
with
pity
the
poor
old
boy
looked
a
wreck
i
say
i
said
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
he
leaped
out
of
the
chair
with
a
smothered
yell
did
you
do
that
what
did
you
do
it
for
what
the
sense
of
it
how
do
you
suppose
you
can
ever
make
yourself
popular
if
you
go
about
touching
people
on
the
shoulder
my
nerves
are
sticking
a
yard
out
of
my
body
this
morning
reggie
yes
old
boy
i
did
a
murder
last
night
what
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
might
happen
to
anybody
directly
stella
vanderley
broke
off
our
engagement
i
broke
off
your
engagement
how
long
were
you
engaged
about
two
minutes
it
may
have
been
less
i
had
a
i
proposed
to
her
at
ten
last
night
in
the
saloon
she
accepted
me
i
was
just
going
to
kiss
her
when
we
heard
someone
coming
i
went
out
coming
along
the
corridor
was
that
infernal
maid
pilbeam
have
you
ever
been
accepted
by
the
girl
you
love
reggie

i
been
refused

wo
understand
how
i
felt
i
was
off
my
head
with
joy
i
hardly
knew
what
i
was
doing
i
just
felt
i
had
to
kiss

nearest
thing

could
wait

might
have
been
the
ship
cat
it
was
it

pilbeam

and
just
at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
saloon
opened
and
out

stella
great
scott
exactly
what
i
said
it
flashed
across
me
that
to
stella
dear
girl
not
knowing
the
circumstances
the
thing
might
seem
a
little
odd
it
did
she
broke
off
the
engagement
and
i
got
out
the
dinghy
and
rowed
off
i
was
mad
i
did
care
what
became
of
me
i
simply
wanted
to
forget
i
went
ashore
i
it
just
on
the
cards
that
i
may
have
drowned
my
sorrows
a
bit
anyhow
i
do
remember
a
thing
except
that
i
can
recollect
having
the
deuce
of
a
scrap
with
somebody
in
a
dark
street
and
somebody
falling
and
myself
falling
and
myself
legging

was
worth

me
i
give
it
to
him
when
he
comes
very
good
sir
oh
voules
are
they
all
still
at
breakfast
the
gentleman
who
came
to
see
lattaker
still
hard
at
it
he
is
at
present
occupied
with
a
kippered
herring
sir
ah
that
all
voules
thank
you
sir
he
retired
i
called
to
george
and
he
came
out
who
was
it
only
voules
he
brought
a
letter
for
you
they
all
at
breakfast
still
the
sleuth
eating
kippers
that
hold
him
for
a
bit
full
of
bones
he
began
to
read
his
letter
he
gave
a
kind
of
grunt
of
surprise
at
the
first
paragraph
well
i
hanged
he
said
as
he
finished
reggie
this
is
a
queer
thing
what
that
he
handed
me
the
letter
and
directly
i
started
in
on
it
i
saw
why
he
had
grunted
this
is
how
it
ran
my
dear
george
i
shall
be
seeing
you
i
hope
but
i
think
it
is
better
before
we
meet
to
prepare
you
for
a
curious
situation
that
has
arisen
in
connection
with
the
legacy
which
your
father
inherited
from
your
aunt
emily
and
which
you
are
expecting
me
as
trustee
to
hand
over
to
you
now
that
you
have
reached
your
birthday
you
have
doubtless
heard
your
father
speak
of
your
alfred
who
was
lost
or
kidnapped
which
was
never
ascertained
when
you
were
both
babies
when
no
news
was
received
of
him
for
so
many
years
it
was
supposed
that
he
was
dead
yesterday
however
i
received
a
letter
purporting
that
he
had
been
living
all
this
time
in
buenos
ayres
as
the
adopted
son
of
a
wealthy
south
american
and
has
only
recently
discovered
his
identity
he
states
that
he
is
on
his
way
to
meet
me
and
will
arrive
any
day
now
of
course
like
other
claimants
he
may
prove
to
be
an
impostor
but
meanwhile
his
intervention
will
i
fear
cause
a
certain
delay
before
i
can
hand
over
your
money
to
you
it
will
be
necessary
to
go
into
a
thorough
examination
of
credentials
and
this
will
take
some
time
but
i
will
go
fully
into
the
matter
with
you
when
we
your
affectionate
uncle
augustus
arbutt
i
read
it
through
twice
and
the
second
time
i
had
one
of
those
ideas
i
do
sometimes
get
though
admittedly
a
chump
of
the
premier
class
i
have
seldom
had
such
a
thoroughly
corking
why
old
top
i
said
this
lets
you
out
lets
me
out
of
half
the
darned
money
if
that
what
you
mean
if
this
chap
not
an
imposter
and
there
no
earthly
reason
to
suppose
he
is
though
i
never
heard
my
father
say
a
word
about
him
we
shall
have
to
split
the
money
aunt
emily
will
left
the
money
to
my
father
or
failing
him
his
i
thought
that
meant
me
but
apparently
there
are
a
crowd
of
us
i
call
it
rotten
work
springing
unexpected
offspring
on
a
fellow
at
the
eleventh
hour
like
this
why
you
chump
i
said
it
going
to
save
you
this
lets
you
out
of
your
spectacular
dash
across
the
frontier
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
stay
here
and
be
your
brother
alfred
it
came
to
me
in
a
flash
he
looked
at
me
in
a
kind
of
dazed
way
you
ought
to
be
in
some
sort
of
a
home
reggie
ass
i
cried
do
you
understand
have
you
ever
heard
of
who
were
exactly
alike
who
to
say
you
alfred
if
you
swear
you
are
your
uncle
will
be
there
to
back
you
up
that
you
have
a
brother
alfred
and
alfred
will
be
there
to
call
me
a
liar
he
wo
it
not
as
if
you
had
to
keep
it
up
for
the
rest
of
your
life
it
only
for
an
hour
or
two
till
we
can
get
this
detective
off
the
yacht
we
sail
for
england
morning
at
last
the
thing
seemed
to
sink
into
him
his
face
brightened
why
i
really
do
believe
it
would
work
he
said
of
course
it
would
work
if
they
want
proof
show
them
your
mole
swear
george
had
one
and
as
alfred
i
should
get
a
chance
of
talking
to
stella
and
making
things
all
right
for
george
reggie
old
top
you
a
genius
no
no
you
well
it
only
sometimes
i
ca
keep
it
up
and
just
then
there
was
a
gentle
cough
behind
us
we
spun
round
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
voules
i
said
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
have
heard
all
i
looked
at
george
george
looked
at
me
voules
is
all
right
i
said
decent
voules
voules
would
give
us
away
would
you
voules
yes
sir
you
would
yes
sir
but
voules
old
man
i
said
be
sensible
what
would
you
gain
by
it
financially
sir
nothing
whereas
by
keeping
quiet
i
tapped
him
on
the
chest
by
holding
your
tongue
voules
by
saying
nothing
about
it
to
anybody
voules
old
fellow
you
might
gain
a
considerable
sum
am
i
to
understand
sir
that
because
you
are
rich
and
i
am
poor
you
think
that
you
can
buy
my
oh
come
i
said
how
much
said
voules
so
we
switched
to
terms
you
would
believe
the
way
the
man
haggled
you
have
thought
a
decent
faithful
servant
would
have
been
delighted
to
oblige
one
in
a
little
matter
like
that
for
a
fiver
but
not
voules
by
no
means
it
was
a
hundred
down
and
the
promise
of
another
hundred
when
we
had
got
safely
away
before
he
was
satisfied
but
we
fixed
it
up
at
last
and
poor
old
george
got
down
to
his
and
changed
his
clothes
he
hardly
gone
when
the
came
on
deck
did
you
meet
him
i
asked
meet
whom
said
old
marshall
george
alfred
i
did
know
george
had
a
brother
nor
did
he
till
yesterday
it
a
long
story
he
was
kidnapped
in
infancy
and
everyone
thought
he
was
dead
george
had
a
letter
from
his
uncle
about
him
yesterday
i
should
wonder
if
that
where
george
has
gone
to
see
his
uncle
and
find
out
about
it
in
the
meantime
alfred
has
arrived
he
down
in
george
now
having
a
it
amaze
you
the
likeness
between
them
you
think
it
george
at
first
look
here
he
comes
and
up
came
george
brushed
and
clean
in
an
ordinary
yachting
suit
they
were
rattled
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
they
stood
looking
at
him
as
if
they
thought
there
was
a
catch
somewhere
but
were
quite
certain
where
it
was
i
introduced
him
and
still
they
looked
doubtful
pepper
tells
me
my
brother
is
not
on
board
said
george
it
an
amazing
likeness
said
old
marshall
is
my
brother
like
me
asked
george
amiably
no
one
could
tell
you
apart
i
said
i
suppose
twins
always
are
alike
said
george
but
if
it
ever
came
to
a
question
of
identification
there
would
be
one
way
of
distinguishing
us
do
you
know
george
well
mr
pepper
he
a
dear
old
pal
of
mine
you
been
swimming
with
him
perhaps
every
day
last
august
well
then
you
would
have
noticed
it
if
he
had
had
a
mole
like
this
on
the
back
of
his
neck
would
you
he
turned
his
back
and
stooped
and
showed
the
mole
his
collar
hid
it
at
ordinary
times
i
had
seen
it
often
when
we
were
bathing
together
has
george
a
mole
like
that
he
asked
no
i
said
oh
no
you
would
have
noticed
it
if
he
had
yes
i
said
oh
yes
i
glad
of
that
said
george
it
would
be
a
nuisance
not
to
be
able
to
prove
one
own
identity
that
seemed
to
satisfy
them
all
they
could
get
away
from
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
from
now
on
the
thing
was
a
and
i
think
george
felt
the
same
for
when
old
marshall
asked
him
if
he
had
had
breakfast
he
said
he
had
not
went
below
and
pitched
in
as
if
he
had
a
care
in
the
world
everything
went
right
till
george
sat
in
the
shade
on
the
foredeck
talking
to
stella
most
of
the
time
when
the
gong
went
and
the
rest
had
started
to
go
below
he
drew
me
back
he
was
beaming
it
all
right
he
said
what
did
i
tell
you
what
did
you
tell
me
why
about
stella
did
i
say
that
alfred
would
fix
things
for
george
i
told
her
she
looked
worried
and
got
her
to
tell
me
what
the
trouble
was
and
then
you
must
have
shown
a
flash
of
speed
if
you
got
her
to
confide
in
you
after
knowing
you
for
about
two
hours
perhaps
i
did
said
george
modestly
i
had
no
notion
till
i
became
him
what
a
persuasive
sort
of
chap
my
brother
alfred
was
anyway
she
told
me
all
about
it
and
i
started
in
to
show
her
that
george
was
a
pretty
good
sort
of
fellow
on
the
whole
who
ought
to
be
turned
down
for
what
was
evidently
merely
temporary
insanity
she
saw
my
point
and
it
all
right
absolutely
if
only
we
can
produce
george
how
much
longer
does
that
infernal
sleuth
intend
to
stay
here
he
seems
to
have
taken
root
i
fancy
he
thinks
that
you
bound
to
come
back
sooner
or
later
and
is
waiting
for
you
he
an
absolute
nuisance
said
george
we
were
moving
towards
the
companion
way
to
go
below
for
lunch
when
a
boat
hailed
us
we
went
to
the
side
and
looked
over
it
my
uncle
said
george
a
stout
man
came
up
the
gangway
halloa
george
he
said
get
my
letter
i
think
you
are
mistaking
me
for
my
brother
said
george
my
name
is
alfred
lattaker
what
that
i
am
george
brother
alfred
are
you
my
uncle
augustus
the
stout
man
stared
at
him
you
very
like
george
he
said
so
everyone
tells
me
and
you
really
alfred
i
am
i
like
to
talk
business
with
you
for
a
moment
he
cocked
his
eye
at
me
i
sidled
off
and
went
below
at
the
foot
of
the
i
met
voules
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
voules
if
it
would
be
convenient
i
should
be
glad
to
have
the
afternoon
off
i
bound
to
say
i
rather
liked
his
manner
absolutely
normal
not
a
trace
of
the
about
it
i
gave
him
the
afternoon
off
i
had
lunch
george
did
show
up
and
as
i
was
going
out
i
was
waylaid
by
the
girl
pilbeam
she
had
been
crying
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
did
voules
ask
you
for
the
afternoon
i
did
see
what
business
if
was
of
hers
but
she
seemed
all
worked
up
about
it
so
i
told
her
yes
i
have
given
him
the
afternoon
off
she
broke
down
absolutely
collapsed
devilish
unpleasant
it
was
hopeless
in
a
situation
like
this
after
i
said
there
there
which
did
seem
to
help
much
i
had
any
remarks
to
make
he
he
was
going
to
the
tables
to
gamble
away
all
his
savings
and
then
shoot
himself
because
he
had
nothing
left
to
live
for
i
suddenly
remembered
the
scrap
in
the
small
hours
outside
my
door
i
hate
mysteries
i
meant
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
i
could
have
a
really
valet
like
voules
going
about
the
place
shooting
himself
up
evidently
the
girl
pilbeam
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
thing
i
questioned
her
she
sobbed
i
questioned
her
more
i
was
firm
and
eventually
she
yielded
up
the
facts
voules
had
seen
george
kiss
her
the
night
before
that
was
the
trouble
things
began
to
piece
themselves
together
i
went
up
to
interview
george
there
was
going
to
be
another
job
for
persuasive
alfred
voules
mind
had
got
to
be
eased
as
stella
had
been
i
could
afford
to
lose
a
fellow
with
his
genius
for
preserving
a
i
found
george
on
the
foredeck
what
is
it
shakespeare
or
somebody
says
about
some
fellow
face
being
sicklied
with
the
pale
cast
of
care
george
was
like
that
he
looked
green
finished
with
your
uncle
i
said
he
grinned
a
ghostly
grin
there
is
any
uncle
he
said
there
is
any
alfred
and
there
is
any
money
explain
yourself
old
top
i
said
it
wo
take
long
the
old
crook
has
spent
every
penny
of
the
trust
money
he
been
at
it
for
years
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
when
the
time
came
to
cough
up
and
i
was
due
to
see
that
he
did
it
he
went
to
the
tables
in
the
hope
of
a
run
of
luck
and
lost
the
last
remnant
of
the
stuff
he
had
to
find
a
way
of
holding
me
for
a
while
and
postponing
the
squaring
of
accounts
while
he
got
away
and
he
invented
this
business
he
knew
i
should
find
out
sooner
or
later
but
meanwhile
he
would
be
able
to
get
off
to
south
america
which
he
has
done
he
on
his
way
now
you
let
him
go
what
could
i
do
i
ca
afford
to
make
a
fuss
with
that
man
sturgis
around
i
ca
prove
there
no
alfred
when
my
only
chance
of
avoiding
prison
is
to
be
alfred
well
you
made
things
right
for
yourself
with
stella
vanderley
anyway
i
said
to
cheer
him
up
what
the
good
of
that
now
i
hardly
any
money
and
no
prospects
how
can
i
marry
her
i
pondered
it
looks
to
me
old
top
i
said
at
last
as
if
things
were
in
a
bit
of
a
mess
you
guessed
it
said
poor
old
george
i
spent
the
afternoon
musing
on
life
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
what
a
queer
thing
life
is
so
unlike
anything
else
do
you
know
if
you
see
what
i
mean
at
any
moment
you
may
be
strolling
peacefully
along
and
all
the
time
life
waiting
around
the
corner
to
fetch
you
one
you
ca
tell
when
you
may
be
going
to
get
it
it
all
dashed
puzzling
here
was
poor
old
george
as
a
fellow
as
ever
stepped
getting
swatted
all
over
the
ring
by
the
hand
of
fate
why
that
what
i
asked
myself
just
life
do
you
know
that
all
there
was
about
it
it
was
close
on
six
when
our
third
visitor
of
the
day
arrived
we
were
sitting
on
the
afterdeck
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
old
marshall
denman
sturgis
vanderley
stella
george
and
i
when
he
came
up
we
had
been
talking
of
george
and
old
marshall
was
suggesting
the
advisability
of
sending
out
he
was
worried
so
was
stella
vanderley
so
for
that
matter
were
george
and
i
only
not
for
the
same
reason
we
were
just
arguing
the
thing
out
when
the
visitor
appeared
he
was
a
stiff
sort
of
fellow
he
spoke
with
a
german
accent
mr
marshall
he
said
i
am
count
fritz
von
c√∂slin
equerry
to
his
serene
highness
he
clicked
his
heels
together
and
saluted
the
prince
of
vanderley
jumped
up
why
count
she
said
what
ages
since
we
met
in
vienna
you
remember
could
i
ever
forget
and
the
charming
miss
stella
she
is
well
i
suppose
not
stella
you
remember
count
fritz
stella
shook
hands
with
him
and
how
is
the
poor
dear
prince
asked
vanderley
what
a
terrible
thing
to
have
happened
i
rejoice
to
say
that
my
master
is
better
he
has
regained
consciousness
and
is
sitting
up
and
taking
nourishment
that
good
said
old
marshall
in
a
spoon
only
sighed
the
count
marshall
with
your
permission
i
should
like
a
word
with
mr
sturgis
mr
who
the
sportsman
came
forward
i
am
denman
sturgis
at
your
service
the
deuce
you
are
what
are
you
doing
here
sturgis
explained
the
count
graciously
volunteered
his
services
i
know
but
what
he
doing
here
i
am
waiting
for
george
lattaker
mr
marshall

not
found
him

the
count
anxiously

hope

so
shortly

know
what
he
looks
like
now
this
gentleman
is
his
they

doubles
you
are
sure
this
gentleman
is
not
george
lattaker
george
put
his
foot
down
firmly
on
the
suggestion
do
go
mixing
me
up
with
my
brother
he
said
i
am
alfred
you
can
tell
me
by
my
mole
he
exhibited
the
mole
he
was
taking
no
risks
the
count
clicked
his
tongue
regretfully
i
am
sorry
he
said
george
did
offer
to
console
him
do
worry
said
sturgis
he
wo
escape
me
i
shall
find
him
do
sturgis
do
and
quickly
find
swiftly
that
noble
young
man
what
shouted
george
that
noble
young
man
george
lattaker
who
at
the
risk
of
his
life
saved
my
master
from
the
assassin
george
sat
down
suddenly
i
do
understand
he
said
feebly
we
were
wrong
sturgis
went
on
the
count
we
leaped
to
the
conclusion
was
it
not
so
that
the
owner
of
the
hat
you
found
was
also
the
assailant
of
my
master
we
were
wrong
i
have
heard
the
story
from
his
serene
highness
own
lips
he
was
passing
down
a
dark
street
when
a
ruffian
in
a
mask
sprang
out
upon
him
doubtless
he
had
been
followed
from
the
casino
where
he
had
been
winning
heavily
my
master
was
taken
by
surprise
he
was
felled
but
before
he
lost
consciousness
he
perceived
a
young
man
in
evening
dress
wearing
the
hat
you
found
running
swiftly
towards
him
the
hero
engaged
the
assassin
in
combat
and
my
master
remembers
no
more
his
serene
highness
asks
repeatedly
is
my
brave
preserver
his
gratitude
is
princely
he
seeks
for
this
young
man
to
reward
him
ah
you
should
be
proud
of
your
brother
sir
thanks
said
george
limply
and
you
sturgis
you
must
redouble
your
efforts
you
must
search
the
land
you
must
scour
the
sea
to
find
george
lattaker
he
need
take
all
that
trouble
said
a
voice
from
the
gangway
it
was
voules
his
face
was
flushed
his
hat
was
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
he
was
smoking
a
fat
cigar
i
tell
you
where
to
find
george
lattaker
he
shouted
he
glared
at
george
who
was
staring
at
him
yes
look
at
me
he
yelled
look
at
me
you
wo
be
the
first
this
afternoon
who
stared
at
the
mysterious
stranger
who
won
for
two
hours
without
a
break
i
be
even
with
you
now
blooming
lattaker
learn
you
to
break
a
poor
man
heart
marshall
and
gents
this
morning
i
was
on
deck
and
i
plotting
to
put
up
a
game
on
you
they
spotted
that
gent
there
as
a
detective
and
they
arranged
that
blooming
lattaker
was
to
pass
himself
off
as
his
own
and
if
you
wanted
proof
blooming
pepper
tells
him
to
show
them
his
mole
and
he
swear
george
had
one
those
were
his
very
words
that
man
there
is
george
lattaker
hesquire
and
let
him
deny
it
if
he
can
george
got
up
i
have
the
least
desire
to
deny
it
voules
voules
if
please
it
true
said
george
turning
to
the
count
the
fact
is
i
had
rather
a
foggy
recollection
of
what
happened
last
night
i
only
remembered
knocking
some
one
down
and
like
you
i
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
i
must
have
assaulted
his
serene
highness
then
you
are
really
george
lattaker
asked
the
count
i
am
what
does
all
this
mean
demanded
voules
merely
that
i
saved
the
life
of
his
serene
highness
the
prince
of
mr
voules
it
a
swindle
began
voules
when
there
was
a
sudden
rush
and
the
girl
pilbeam
cannoned
into
the
crowd
sending
me
into
old
chair
and
flung
herself
into
the
arms
of
voules
oh
harold
she
cried
i
thought
you
were
dead
i
thought
you
shot
yourself
he
sort
of
braced
himself
together
to
fling
her
off
and
then
he
seemed
to
think
better
of
it
and
fell
into
the
clinch
it
was
all
dashed
romantic
do
you
know
but
there
limits
voules
you
sacked
i
said
who
cares
he
said
think
i
was
going
to
stop
on
now
i
a
gentleman
of
property
come
along
emma
my
dear
give
a
month
notice
and
get
your
and
i
take
you
to
dinner
at
ciro
and
you
lattaker
said
the
count
may
i
conduct
you
to
the
presence
of
my
master
he
wishes
to
show
his
gratitude
to
his
preserver
you
may
said
george
may
i
have
my
hat
mr
sturgis
there
just
one
bit
more
after
dinner
that
night
i
came
up
for
a
smoke
and
strolling
on
to
the
foredeck
almost
bumped
into
george
and
stella
they
seemed
to
be
having
an
argument
i
not
sure
she
was
saying
that
i
believe
that
a
man
can
be
so
happy
that
he
wants
to
kiss
the
nearest
thing
in
sight
as
you
put
it
do
you
said
george
well
as
it
happens
i
feeling
just
that
way
now
i
coughed
and
he
turned
round
halloa
reggie
he
said
halloa
george
i
said
lovely
night
beautiful
said
stella
the
moon
i
said
ripping
said
george
lovely
said
stella
and
look
at
the
reflection
of
the
stars
on
the
george
caught
my
eye
pop
off
he
said
i
popped
doing
clarence
a
bit
of
good
have
you
ever
thought
about
and
when
i
say
thought
about
i
mean
really
carefully
considered
the
question
of
the
coolness
the
cheek
or
if
you
prefer
it
the
gall
with
which
woman
as
a
sex
fairly
bursts
have
by
jove
but
then
i
had
it
thrust
on
my
notice
by
george
in
a
way
i
should
imagine
has
happened
to
pretty
few
fellows
and
the
limit
was
reached
by
that
business
of
the
yeardsley
venus
to
make
you
understand
the
full
of
the
situation
i
shall
have
to
explain
just
how
matters
stood
between
yeardsley
and
myself
when
i
first
knew
her
she
was
elizabeth
shoolbred
old
worcestershire
family
pots
of
money
pretty
as
a
picture
her
brother
bill
was
at
oxford
with
me
i
loved
elizabeth
shoolbred
i
loved
her
do
you
know
and
there
was
a
time
for
about
a
week
when
we
were
engaged
to
be
married
but
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
take
a
serious
view
of
life
and
study
furniture
catalogues
and
feel
pretty
solemn
when
the
restaurant
orchestra
played
the
wedding
glide
i
hanged
if
she
did
break
it
off
and
a
month
later
she
was
married
to
a
fellow
of
the
name
of
yeardsley
clarence
yeardsley
an
artist
what
with
golf
and
billiards
and
a
bit
of
racing
and
fellows
at
the
club
rallying
round
and
kind
of
taking
me
out
of
myself
as
it
were
i
got
over
it
and
came
to
look
on
the
affair
as
a
closed
page
in
the
book
of
my
life
if
you
know
what
i
mean
it
did
seem
likely
to
me
that
we
should
meet
again
as
she
and
clarence
had
settled
down
in
the
country
somewhere
and
never
came
to
london
and
i
bound
to
own
that
by
the
time
i
got
her
letter
the
wound
had
pretty
well
healed
and
i
was
to
a
certain
extent
sitting
up
and
taking
nourishment
in
fact
to
be
absolutely
honest
i
was
jolly
thankful
the
thing
had
ended
as
it
had
done
this
letter
i
telling
you
about
arrived
one
morning
out
of
a
blue
sky
as
it
were
it
ran
like
this
my
dear
old
reggie
what
ages
it
seems
since
i
saw
anything
of
you
how
are
you
we
have
settled
down
here
in
the
most
perfect
old
house
with
a
lovely
garden
in
the
middle
of
delightful
country
could
you
run
down
here
for
a
few
days
clarence
and
i
would
be
so
glad
to
see
you
bill
is
here
and
is
most
anxious
to
meet
you
again
he
was
speaking
of
you
only
this
morning
come
wire
your
train
and
i
will
send
the
car
to
meet
you
yours
most
sincerely
elizabeth
yeardsley
we
can
give
you
new
milk
and
fresh
eggs
think
of
that
bill
says
our
is
one
of
the
best
he
has
ever
played
on
we
are
only
half
a
mile
from
a
golf
course
bill
says
it
is
better
than
andrews
you
come
well
a
fellow
comes
down
to
breakfast
one
morning
with
a
bit
of
a
head
on
and
finds
a
letter
like
that
from
a
girl
who
might
quite
easily
have
blighted
his
life
it
rattled
me
rather
i
must
confess
however
that
bit
about
the
golf
settled
me
i
knew
bill
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
and
if
he
said
the
course
was
so
topping
it
must
be
something
special
so
i
went
old
bill
met
me
at
the
station
with
the
car
i
had
come
across
him
for
some
months
and
i
was
glad
to
see
him
again
and
he
apparently
was
glad
to
see
me
thank
goodness
you
come
he
said
as
we
drove
off
i
was
just
about
at
my
last
grip
what
the
trouble
old
scout
i
asked
if
i
had
the
artistic
he
went
on
if
the
mere
mention
of
pictures
did
give
me
the
pip
i
dare
say
it
would
be
so
bad
as
it
is
it
rotten
pictures
pictures
nothing
else
is
mentioned
in
this
household
clarence
is
an
artist
so
is
his
father
and
you
know
yourself
what
elizabeth
is
like
when
one
gives
her
her
head
i
remembered
then
it
had
come
back
to
me
before
that
most
of
my
time
with
elizabeth
had
been
spent
in
during
the
period
when
i
had
let
her
do
just
what
she
wanted
to
do
with
me
i
had
had
to
follow
her
like
a
dog
through
gallery
after
gallery
though
pictures
are
poison
to
me
just
as
they
are
to
old
bill
somehow
it
had
never
struck
me
that
she
would
still
be
going
on
in
this
way
after
marrying
an
artist
i
should
have
thought
that
by
this
time
the
mere
sight
of
a
picture
would
have
fed
her
up
not
so
however
according
to
old
bill
they
talk
pictures
at
every
meal
he
said
i
tell
you
it
makes
a
chap
feel
out
of
it
how
long
are
you
down
for
a
few
days
take
my
tip
and
let
me
send
you
a
wire
from
london
i
go
there
i
promised
to
play
against
the
scottish
the
idea
was
that
i
was
to
come
back
after
the
match
but
you
could
get
me
back
with
a
lasso
i
tried
to
point
out
the
silver
lining
but
bill
old
scout
your
sister
says
there
a
most
corking
links
near
here
he
turned
and
stared
at
me
and
nearly
ran
us
into
the
bank
you
do
mean
honestly
she
said
that
she
said
you
said
it
was
better
than
st
andrews
so
i
did
was
that
all
she
said
i
said
well
was
it
enough
she
did
happen
to
mention
that
i
added
the
words
do
think
no
she
forgot
to
tell
me
that
it
the
worst
course
in
great
britain
i
felt
rather
stunned
do
you
know
whether
it
a
bad
habit
to
have
got
into
or
not
i
ca
say
but
i
simply
ca
do
without
my
daily
allowance
of
golf
when
i
not
in
london
i
took
another
whirl
at
the
silver
lining
we
have
to
take
it
out
in
billiards
i
said
i
glad
the
good
it
depends
what
you
call
good
it
and
there
a
cut
just
out
of
baulk
where
clarence
cue
slipped
elizabeth
has
mended
it
with
pink
silk
very
smart
and
dressy
it
looks
but
it
does
improve
the
thing
as
a
but
she
said
you
said
must
have
been
pulling
your
leg
we
turned
in
at
the
drive
gates
of
a
house
standing
well
back
from
the
road
it
looked
black
and
sinister
in
the
dusk
and
i
could
help
feeling
you
know
like
one
of
those
johnnies
you
read
about
in
stories
who
are
lured
to
lonely
houses
for
rummy
purposes
and
hear
a
shriek
just
as
they
get
there
elizabeth
knew
me
well
enough
to
know
that
a
specially
good
golf
course
was
a
safe
draw
to
me
and
she
had
deliberately
played
on
her
knowledge
what
was
the
game
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
know
and
then
a
sudden
thought
struck
me
which
brought
me
out
in
a
cold
perspiration
she
had
some
girl
down
here
and
was
going
to
have
a
stab
at
marrying
me
off
i
often
heard
that
young
married
women
are
all
over
that
sort
of
thing
certainly
she
had
said
there
was
nobody
at
the
house
but
clarence
and
herself
and
bill
and
father
but
a
woman
who
could
take
the
name
of
andrews
in
vain
as
she
had
done
would
be
likely
to
stick
at
a
trifle
bill
old
scout
i
said
there
are
any
frightful
girls
or
any
rot
of
that
sort
stopping
here
are
there
wish
there
were
he
said
no
such
luck
as
we
pulled
up
at
the
front
door
it
opened
and
a
woman
figure
appeared
have
you
got
him
bill
she
said
which
in
my
present
frame
of
mind
struck
me
as
a
jolly
creepy
way
of
putting
it
the
sort
of
thing
lady
macbeth
might
have
said
to
macbeth
do
you
know
do
you
mean
me
i
said
she
came
down
into
the
light
it
was
elizabeth
looking
just
the
same
as
in
the
old
days
is
that
you
reggie
i
so
glad
you
were
able
to
come
i
was
afraid
you
might
have
forgotten
all
about
it
you
know
what
you
are
come
along
in
and
have
some
tea
have
you
ever
been
turned
down
by
a
girl
who
afterwards
married
and
then
been
introduced
to
her
husband
if
so
you
understand
how
i
felt
when
clarence
burst
on
me
you
know
the
feeling
first
of
all
when
you
hear
about
the
marriage
you
say
to
yourself
i
wonder
what
he
like
then
you
meet
him
and
think
there
must
be
some
mistake
she
ca
have
preferred
to
me
that
what
i
thought
when
i
set
eyes
on
clarence
he
was
a
little
thin
chappie
of
about
his
hair
was
getting
grey
at
the
temples
and
straggly
on
top
he
wore
and
he
had
a
drooping
moustache
i
no
bombardier
wells
myself
but
in
front
of
clarence
i
felt
quite
a
nut
and
elizabeth
mind
you
is
one
of
those
tall
splendid
girls
who
look
like
princesses
honestly
i
believe
women
do
it
out
of
pure
cussedness
how
do
you
do
pepper
hark
can
you
hear
a
mewing
cat
said
clarence
all
in
one
breath
do
you
know
eh
i
said
a
mewing
cat
i
feel
sure
i
hear
a
mewing
cat
listen
while
we
were
listening
the
door
opened
and
a
old
gentleman
came
in
he
was
built
on
the
same
lines
as
clarence
but
was
an
earlier
model
i
took
him
correctly
to
be
yeardsley
senior
elizabeth
introduced
us
father
said
clarence
did
you
meet
a
mewing
cat
outside
i
feel
positive
i
heard
a
cat
mewing
no
said
the
father
shaking
his
head
no
mewing
cat
i
ca
bear
mewing
cats
said
clarence
a
mewing
cat
gets
on
my
nerves
a
mewing
cat
is
so
trying
said
elizabeth
dislike
mewing
cats
said
old
yeardsley
that
was
all
about
mewing
cats
for
the
moment
they
seemed
to
think
they
had
covered
the
ground
satisfactorily
and
they
went
back
to
pictures
we
talked
pictures
steadily
till
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
at
least
they
did
i
just
sort
of
sat
around
presently
the
subject
of
came
up
somebody
mentioned
the
monna
lisa
and
then
i
happened
to
remember
seeing
something
in
the
evening
paper
as
i
was
coming
down
in
the
train
about
some
fellow
somewhere
having
had
a
valuable
painting
pinched
by
burglars
the
night
before
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
had
a
chance
of
breaking
into
the
conversation
with
any
effect
and
i
meant
to
make
the
most
of
it
the
paper
was
in
the
pocket
of
my
overcoat
in
the
hall
i
went
and
fetched
it
here
it
is
i
said
a
romney
belonging
to
sir
bellamy
palmer
they
all
shouted
what
exactly
at
the
same
time
like
a
chorus
elizabeth
grabbed
the
paper
let
me
look
yes
last
night
burglars
entered
the
residence
of
sir
bellamy
palmer
dryden
park
midford
hants
why
that
near
here
i
said
i
passed
through
midford
dryden
park
is
only
two
miles
from
this
house
said
elizabeth
i
noticed
her
eyes
were
sparkling
only
two
miles
she
said
it
might
have
been
us
it
might
have
been
the
old
yeardsley
bounded
in
his
chair
the
he
cried
they
all
seemed
wonderfully
excited
my
little
contribution
to
the
evening
chat
had
made
quite
a
hit
why
i
did
notice
it
before
i
do
know
but
it
was
not
till
elizabeth
showed
it
to
me
after
dinner
that
i
had
my
first
look
at
the
yeardsley
venus
when
she
led
me
up
to
it
and
switched
on
the
light
it
seemed
impossible
that
i
could
have
sat
right
through
dinner
without
noticing
it
but
then
at
meals
my
attention
is
pretty
well
riveted
on
the
foodstuffs
anyway
it
was
not
till
elizabeth
showed
it
to
me
that
i
was
aware
of
its
existence
she
and
i
were
alone
in
the
after
dinner
old
yeardsley
was
writing
letters
in
the
while
bill
and
clarence
were
rollicking
on
the
billiard
table
with
the
pink
silk
tapestry
effects
all
in
fact
was
joy
jollity
and
song
so
to
speak
when
elizabeth
who
had
been
sitting
wrapped
in
thought
for
a
bit
bent
towards
me
and
said
reggie
and
the
moment
she
said
it
i
knew
something
was
going
to
happen
you
know
that
you
get
sometimes
well
i
got
it
then
i
said
nervously
reggie
she
said
i
want
to
ask
a
great
favour
of
you
yes
she
stooped
down
and
put
a
log
on
the
fire
and
went
on
with
her
back
to
me
do
you
remember
reggie
once
saying
you
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
me
there
that
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
about
the
cheek
of
woman
as
a
sex
what
i
mean
is
after
what
had
happened
you
have
thought
she
would
have
preferred
to
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
what
mind
you
i
said
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
for
her
i
admit
that
but
it
was
a
distinctly
remark
he
appeared
on
the
scene
then
and
it
stands
to
reason
that
a
fellow
who
may
have
been
a
perfect
to
a
girl
when
he
was
engaged
to
her
does
feel
nearly
so
keen
on
spreading
himself
in
that
direction
when
she
has
given
him
the
and
gone
and
married
a
man
who
reason
and
instinct
both
tell
him
is
a
decided
blighter
i
could
think
of
anything
to
say
but
oh
yes
there
something
you
can
do
for
me
now
which
will
make
me
everlastingly
grateful
yes
i
said
do
you
know
reggie
she
said
suddenly
that
only
a
few
months
ago
clarence
was
very
fond
of
cats
eh
well
he
still
seems
er
in
them
what
now
they
get
on
his
nerves
everything
gets
on
his
nerves
some
fellows
swear
by
that
stuff
you
see
advertised
all
over
the
no
that
would
help
him
he
does
need
to
take
anything
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
something
i
do
quite
follow
get
rid
of
something
the
said
elizabeth
she
looked
up
and
caught
my
bulging
eye
you
saw
the
she
said
not
that
i
remember
well
come
into
the
we
went
into
the
and
she
switched
on
the
lights
there
she
said
on
the
wall
close
to
the
door
that
may
have
been
why
i
had
noticed
it
before
i
had
sat
with
my
back
to
it
was
a
large
it
was
what
you
call
a
classical
picture
i
suppose
what
i
mean
is
well
you
know
what
i
mean
all
i
can
say
is
that
it
funny
i
noticed
it
is
that
the
i
said
she
nodded
how
would
you
like
to
have
to
look
at
that
every
time
you
sat
down
to
a
meal
well
i
do
know
i
do
think
it
would
affect
me
much
i
worry
through
all
right
she
jerked
her
head
impatiently
but
you
not
an
artist
she
said
clarence
is
and
then
i
began
to
see
daylight
what
exactly
was
the
trouble
i
understand
but
it
was
evidently
something
to
do
with
the
good
old
artistic
temperament
and
i
could
believe
anything
about
that
it
explains
everything
it
like
the
unwritten
law
do
you
know
which
you
plead
in
america
if
you
done
anything
they
want
to
send
you
to
chokey
for
and
you
do
want
to
go
what
i
mean
is
if
absolutely
off
your
rocker
but
do
find
it
convenient
to
be
scooped
into
the
you
simply
explain
that
when
you
said
you
were
a
teapot
it
was
just
your
artistic
temperament
and
they
apologize
and
go
away
so
i
stood
by
to
hear
just
how
the
had
affected
clarence
the
cat
friend
ready
for
anything
and
believe
me
it
had
hit
clarence
badly
it
was
this
way
it
seemed
that
old
yeardsley
was
an
amateur
artist
and
that
this
venus
was
his
masterpiece
he
said
so
and
he
ought
to
have
known
well
when
clarence
married
he
had
given
it
to
him
as
a
wedding
present
and
had
hung
it
where
it
stood
with
his
own
hands
all
right
so
far
what
but
mark
the
sequel
temperamental
clarence
being
a
professional
artist
and
consequently
some
streets
ahead
of
the
dad
at
the
game
saw
flaws
in
the
venus
he
could
stand
it
at
any
price
he
did
like
the
drawing
he
did
like
the
expression
of
the
face
he
did
like
the
colouring
in
fact
it
made
him
feel
quite
ill
to
look
at
it
yet
being
devoted
to
his
father
and
wanting
to
do
anything
rather
than
give
him
pain
he
had
not
been
able
to
bring
himself
to
store
the
thing
in
the
cellar
and
the
strain
of
confronting
the
picture
three
times
a
day
had
begun
to
tell
on
him
to
such
an
extent
that
elizabeth
felt
something
had
to
be
done
now
you
see
she
said
in
a
way
i
said
but
do
you
think
it
making
rather
heavy
weather
over
a
trifle
oh
ca
you
understand
look
her
voice
dropped
as
if
she
was
in
church
and
she
switched
on
another
light
it
shone
on
the
picture
next
to
old
yeardsley
there
she
said
clarence
painted
that
she
looked
at
me
expectantly
as
if
she
were
waiting
for
me
to
swoon
or
yell
or
something
i
took
a
steady
look
at
clarence
effort
it
was
another
classical
picture
it
seemed
to
me
very
much
like
the
other
one
some
sort
of
art
criticism
was
evidently
expected
of
me
so
i
made
a
dash
at
it
er
i
said
mark
you
sherlock
holmes
would
have
made
the
same
mistake
on
the
evidence
i
mean
no
spring
she
snapped
she
switched
off
the
light
i
see
you
do
understand
even
now
you
never
had
any
taste
about
pictures
when
we
used
to
go
to
the
galleries
together
you
would
far
rather
have
been
at
your
club
this
was
so
absolutely
true
that
i
had
no
remark
to
make
she
came
up
to
me
and
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
i
sorry
reggie
i
did
mean
to
be
cross
only
i
do
want
to
make
you
understand
that
clarence
is
suppose
suppose
well
let
us
take
the
case
of
a
great
musician
suppose
a
great
musician
had
to
sit
and
listen
to
a
cheap
vulgar
tune
the
same
tune
day
after
day
day
after
day
would
you
expect
his
nerves
to
break
well
it
just
like
that
with
clarence
now
you
see
yes
but
but
what
surely
i
put
it
plainly
enough
yes
but
what
i
mean
is
where
do
i
come
in
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
want
you
to
steal
the
i
looked
at
her
you
want
me
to
steal
it
reggie
her
eyes
were
shining
with
excitement
do
you
see
it
providence
when
i
asked
you
to
come
here
i
had
just
got
the
idea
i
knew
i
could
rely
on
you
and
then
by
a
miracle
this
robbery
of
the
romney
takes
place
at
a
house
not
two
miles
away
it
removes
the
last
chance
of
the
poor
old
man
suspecting
anything
and
having
his
feelings
hurt
why
it
the
most
wonderful
compliment
to
him
think
one
night
thieves
steal
a
splendid
romney
the
next
the
same
gang
take
his
it
will
be
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life
do
it
reggie
i
give
you
a
sharp
knife
you
simply
cut
the
canvas
out
of
the
frame
and
it
done
but
one
moment
i
said
i
be
delighted
to
be
of
any
use
to
you
but
in
a
purely
family
affair
like
this
would
it
be
better
in
fact
how
about
tackling
old
bill
on
the
subject
i
have
asked
bill
already
yesterday
he
refused
but
if
i
caught
you
ca
be
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
take
the
picture
open
one
of
the
windows
leave
it
open
and
go
back
to
your
room
it
sounded
simple
enough
and
as
to
the
picture
itself
when
i
got
it
burn
it
i
see
that
you
have
a
good
fire
in
your
room
but
she
looked
at
me
she
always
did
have
the
most
wonderful
eyes
reggie
she
said
nothing
more
just
reggie
she
looked
at
me
well
after
all
if
you
see
what
i
mean
the
days
that
are
no
more
do
you
know
auld
lang
syne
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
follow
me
all
right
i
said
i
do
it
i
do
know
if
you
happen
to
be
one
of
those
johnnies
who
are
steeped
in
crime
and
so
forth
and
think
nothing
of
pinching
diamond
necklaces
if
you
not
you
understand
that
i
felt
a
lot
less
keen
on
the
job
i
taken
on
when
i
sat
in
my
room
waiting
to
get
busy
than
i
had
done
when
i
promised
to
tackle
it
in
the
on
paper
it
all
seemed
easy
enough
but
i
could
help
feeling
there
was
a
catch
somewhere
and
i
never
known
time
pass
slower
the
was
scheduled
for
one
in
the
morning
when
the
household
might
be
expected
to
be
pretty
sound
asleep
but
at
a
quarter
to
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
lit
the
lantern
i
had
taken
from
bill
bicycle
took
a
grip
of
my
knife
and
slunk
downstairs
the
first
thing
i
did
on
getting
to
the
was
to
open
the
window
i
had
half
a
mind
to
smash
it
so
as
to
give
an
extra
bit
of
local
colour
to
the
affair
but
decided
not
to
on
account
of
the
noise
i
had
put
my
lantern
on
the
table
and
was
just
reaching
out
for
it
when
something
happened
what
it
was
for
the
moment
i
could
have
said
it
might
have
been
an
explosion
of
some
sort
or
an
earthquake
some
solid
object
caught
me
a
frightful
whack
on
the
chin
sparks
and
things
occurred
inside
my
head
and
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
feeling
something
wet
and
cold
splash
into
my
face
and
hearing
a
voice
that
sounded
like
old
bill
say
feeling
better
now
i
sat
up
the
lights
were
on
and
i
was
on
the
floor
with
old
bill
kneeling
beside
me
with
a
soda
siphon
what
happened
i
said
i
awfully
sorry
old
man
he
said
i
had
a
notion
it
was
you
i
came
in
here
and
saw
a
lantern
on
the
table
and
the
window
open
and
a
chap
with
a
knife
in
his
hand
so
i
did
stop
to
make
inquiries
i
just
let
go
at
his
jaw
for
all
i
was
worth
what
on
earth
do
you
think
you
doing
were
you
walking
in
your
sleep
it
was
elizabeth
i
said
why
you
know
all
about
it
she
said
she
had
told
you
you
do
mean
the
picture
you
refused
to
take
it
on
so
she
asked
me
reggie
old
man
he
said
i
never
believe
what
they
say
about
repentance
again
it
a
fool
trick
and
upsets
everything
if
i
had
repented
and
thought
it
was
rather
rough
on
elizabeth
not
to
do
a
little
thing
like
that
for
her
and
come
down
here
to
do
it
after
all
you
would
have
stopped
that
with
your
chin
sorry
me
too
i
said
giving
my
head
another
shake
to
make
certain
it
was
still
on
are
you
feeling
better
now
better
than
i
was
but
that
not
saying
much
would
you
like
some
more
no
well
how
about
getting
this
job
finished
and
going
to
bed
and
let
be
quick
about
it
too
you
made
a
noise
like
a
ton
of
bricks
when
you
went
down
just
now
and
it
on
the
cards
some
of
the
servants
may
have
heard
toss
you
who
carves
heads
tails
it
is
he
said
uncovering
the
coin
up
you
get
i
hold
the
light
do
spike
yourself
on
that
sword
of
yours
it
was
as
easy
a
job
as
elizabeth
had
said
just
four
quick
cuts
and
the
thing
came
out
of
its
frame
like
an
oyster
i
rolled
it
up
old
bill
had
put
the
lantern
on
the
floor
and
was
at
the
sideboard
collecting
whisky
soda
and
glasses
we
got
a
long
evening
before
us
he
said
you
ca
burn
a
picture
of
that
size
in
one
chunk
you
set
the
chimney
on
fire
let
do
the
thing
comfortably
clarence
ca
grudge
us
the
stuff
we
done
him
a
bit
of
good
this
trip
be
the
maddest
merriest
day
of
clarence
glad
new
year
on
we
go
we
went
up
to
my
room
and
sat
smoking
and
yarning
away
and
sipping
our
drinks
and
every
now
and
then
cutting
a
slice
off
the
picture
and
shoving
it
in
the
fire
till
it
was
all
gone
and
what
with
the
cosiness
of
it
and
the
cheerful
blaze
and
the
comfortable
feeling
of
doing
good
by
stealth
i
do
know
when
i
had
a
jollier
time
since
the
days
when
we
used
to
brew
in
my
study
at
school
we
had
just
put
the
last
slice
on
when
bill
sat
up
suddenly
and
gripped
my
arm
i
heard
something
he
said
i
listened
and
by
jove
i
heard
something
too
my
room
was
just
over
the
and
the
sound
came
up
to
us
quite
distinctly
stealthy
footsteps
by
george
and
then
a
chair
falling
over
there
somebody
in
the
i
whispered
there
a
certain
type
of
chap
who
takes
a
pleasure
in
positively
chivvying
trouble
old
bill
like
that
if
i
had
been
alone
it
would
have
taken
me
about
three
seconds
to
persuade
myself
that
i
really
heard
anything
after
all
i
a
peaceful
sort
of
cove
and
believe
in
living
and
letting
live
and
so
forth
to
old
bill
however
a
visit
from
burglars
was
pure
jam
he
was
out
of
his
chair
in
one
jump
come
on
he
said
bring
the
poker
i
brought
the
tongs
as
well
i
felt
like
it
old
bill
collared
the
knife
we
crept
downstairs
we
fling
the
door
open
and
make
a
rush
said
bill
supposing
they
shoot
old
scout
burglars
never
shoot
said
bill
which
was
comforting
provided
the
burglars
knew
it
old
bill
took
a
grip
of
the
handle
turned
it
quickly
and
in
he
went
and
then
we
pulled
up
sharp
staring
the
room
was
in
darkness
except
for
a
feeble
splash
of
light
at
the
near
end
standing
on
a
chair
in
front
of
clarence
jocund
spring
holding
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
reaching
up
with
a
knife
in
the
other
was
old
yeardsley
in
bedroom
slippers
and
a
grey
he
had
made
a
final
cut
just
as
we
rushed
in
turning
at
the
sound
he
stopped
and
he
and
the
chair
and
the
candle
and
the
picture
came
down
in
a
heap
together
the
candle
went
out
what
on
earth
said
bill
i
felt
the
same
i
picked
up
the
candle
and
lit
it
and
then
a
most
fearful
thing
happened
the
old
man
picked
himself
up
and
suddenly
collapsed
into
a
chair
and
began
to
cry
like
a
child
of
course
i
could
see
it
was
only
the
artistic
temperament
but
still
believe
me
it
was
devilish
unpleasant
i
looked
at
old
bill
old
bill
looked
at
me
we
shut
the
door
quick
and
after
that
we
did
know
what
to
do
i
saw
bill
look
at
the
sideboard
and
i
knew
what
he
was
looking
for
but
we
had
taken
the
siphon
upstairs
and
his
ideas
of
stopped
short
at
squirting
we
just
waited
and
presently
old
yeardsley
switched
off
sat
up
and
began
talking
with
a
rush
clarence
my
boy
i
was
tempted
it
was
that
burglary
at
dryden
park
it
tempted
me
it
made
it
all
so
simple
i
knew
you
would
put
it
down
to
the
same
gang
clarence
my
boy
i
it
seemed
to
dawn
upon
him
at
this
point
that
clarence
was
not
among
those
present
clarence
he
said
hesitatingly
he
in
bed
i
said
in
bed
then
he
does
know
even
now
young
men
i
throw
myself
on
your
mercy
do
be
hard
on
me
listen
he
grabbed
at
bill
who
sidestepped
i
can
explain
everything
everything
he
gave
a
gulp
you
are
not
artists
you
two
young
men
but
i
will
try
to
make
you
understand
make
you
realise
what
this
picture
means
to
me
i
was
two
years
painting
it
it
is
my
child
i
watched
it
grow
i
loved
it
it
was
part
of
my
life
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
sell
it
and
then
clarence
married
and
in
a
mad
moment
i
gave
my
treasure
to
him
you
can
not
understand
you
two
young
men
what
agonies
i
suffered
the
thing
was
done
it
was
irrevocable
i
saw
how
clarence
valued
the
picture
i
knew
that
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
ask
him
for
it
back
and
yet
i
was
lost
without
it
what
could
i
do
till
this
evening
i
could
see
no
hope
then
came
this
story
of
the
theft
of
the
romney
from
a
house
quite
close
to
this
and
i
saw
my
way
clarence
would
never
suspect
he
would
put
the
robbery
down
to
the
same
band
of
criminals
who
stole
the
romney
once
the
idea
had
come
i
could
not
drive
it
out
i
fought
against
it
but
to
no
avail
at
last
i
yielded
and
crept
down
here
to
carry
out
my
plan
you
found
me
he
grabbed
again
at
me
this
time
and
got
me
by
the
arm
he
had
a
grip
like
a
lobster
young
man
he
said
you
would
not
betray
me
you
would
not
tell
clarence
i
was
feeling
most
frightfully
sorry
for
the
poor
old
chap
by
this
time
do
you
know
but
i
thought
it
would
be
kindest
to
give
it
him
straight
instead
of
breaking
it
by
degrees
i
wo
say
a
word
to
clarence
yeardsley
i
said
i
quite
understand
your
feelings
the
artistic
temperament
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
mean
what
know
but
i
afraid
well
look
i
went
to
the
door
and
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
there
staring
him
in
the
face
were
the
two
empty
frames
he
stood
goggling
at
them
in
silence
then
he
gave
a
sort
of
wheezy
grunt
the
gang
the
burglars
they
been
here
and
they
have
taken
clarence
picture
he
paused
it
might
have
been
mine
my
venus
he
whispered
it
was
getting
most
fearfully
painful
you
know
but
he
had
to
know
the
truth
i
awfully
sorry
you
know
i
said
but
it
he
started
poor
old
chap
eh
what
do
you
mean
they
take
your
venus
but
i
have
it
here
i
shook
my
head
that
clarence
spring
i
said
he
jumped
at
it
and
straightened
it
out
what
what
are
you
talking
about
do
you
think
i
do
know
my
own
picture
my
child
my
venus
see
my
own
signature
in
the
corner
can
you
read
boy
look
yeardsley
this
is
picture
and
well
by
jove
it
do
you
know
well
we
got
him
off
to
bed
him
and
his
infernal
venus
and
we
settled
down
to
take
a
steady
look
at
the
position
of
affairs
bill
said
it
was
my
fault
for
getting
hold
of
the
wrong
picture
and
i
said
it
was
fault
for
fetching
me
such
a
crack
on
the
jaw
that
i
could
be
expected
to
see
what
i
was
getting
hold
of
and
then
there
was
a
pretty
massive
silence
for
a
bit
reggie
said
bill
at
last
how
exactly
do
you
feel
about
facing
clarence
and
elizabeth
at
breakfast
old
scout
i
said
i
was
thinking
much
the
same
myself
reggie
said
bill
i
happen
to
know
there
a
leaving
midford
at
it
is
what
you
call
a
flier
it
gets
to
london
at
about
nine
well
er
in
the
circumstances
how
about
it
the
aunt
and
the
sluggard
now
that
it
all
over
i
may
as
well
admit
that
there
was
a
time
during
the
rather
funny
affair
of
rockmetteller
todd
when
i
thought
that
jeeves
was
going
to
let
me
down
the
man
had
the
appearance
of
being
baffled
jeeves
is
my
man
you
know
officially
he
pulls
in
his
weekly
wages
for
pressing
my
clothes
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
actually
more
like
what
the
poet
johnnie
called
some
bird
of
his
acquaintance
who
was
apt
to
rally
round
him
in
times
of
need
a
guide
do
you
know
philosopher
if
i
remember
rightly
and
i
rather
fancy
friend
i
rely
on
him
at
every
turn
so
naturally
when
rocky
todd
told
me
about
his
aunt
i
hesitate
jeeves
was
in
on
the
thing
from
the
start
the
affair
of
rocky
todd
broke
loose
early
one
morning
of
spring
i
was
in
bed
restoring
the
good
old
tissues
with
about
nine
hours
of
the
dreamless
when
the
door
flew
open
and
somebody
prodded
me
in
the
lower
ribs
and
began
to
shake
the
bedclothes
after
blinking
a
bit
and
generally
pulling
myself
together
i
located
rocky
and
my
first
impression
was
that
it
was
some
horrid
dream
rocky
you
see
lived
down
on
long
island
somewhere
miles
away
from
new
york
and
not
only
that
but
he
had
told
me
himself
more
than
once
that
he
never
got
up
before
twelve
and
seldom
earlier
than
one
constitutionally
the
laziest
young
devil
in
america
he
had
hit
on
a
walk
in
life
which
enabled
him
to
go
the
limit
in
that
direction
he
was
a
poet
at
least
he
wrote
poems
when
he
did
anything
but
most
of
his
time
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
he
spent
in
a
sort
of
trance
he
told
me
once
that
he
could
sit
on
a
fence
watching
a
worm
and
wondering
what
on
earth
it
was
up
to
for
hours
at
a
stretch
he
had
his
scheme
of
life
worked
out
to
a
fine
point
about
once
a
month
he
would
take
three
days
writing
a
few
poems
the
other
three
hundred
and
days
of
the
year
he
rested
i
did
know
there
was
enough
money
in
poetry
to
support
a
chappie
even
in
the
way
in
which
rocky
lived
but
it
seems
that
if
you
stick
to
exhortations
to
young
men
to
lead
the
strenuous
life
and
do
shove
in
any
rhymes
american
editors
fight
for
the
stuff
rocky
showed
me
one
of
his
things
once
it
began
be
be
the
past
is
dead
is
not
born
be
be
with
every
nerve
with
every
muscle
with
every
drop
of
your
red
blood
be
it
was
printed
opposite
the
frontispiece
of
a
magazine
with
a
sort
of
scroll
round
it
and
a
picture
in
the
middle
of
a
chappie
with
bulging
muscles
giving
the
rising
sun
the
glad
eye
rocky
said
they
gave
him
a
hundred
dollars
for
it
and
he
stayed
in
bed
till
four
in
the
afternoon
for
over
a
month
as
regarded
the
future
he
was
pretty
solid
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
had
a
moneyed
aunt
tucked
away
somewhere
in
illinois
and
as
he
had
been
named
rockmetteller
after
her
and
was
her
only
nephew
his
position
was
pretty
sound
he
told
me
that
when
he
did
come
into
the
money
he
meant
to
do
no
work
at
all
except
perhaps
an
occasional
poem
recommending
the
young
man
with
life
opening
out
before
him
with
all
its
splendid
possibilities
to
light
a
pipe
and
shove
his
feet
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
this
was
the
man
who
was
prodding
me
in
the
ribs
in
the
grey
dawn
read
this
bertie
i
could
just
see
that
he
was
waving
a
letter
or
something
equally
foul
in
my
face
wake
up
and
read
this
i
ca
read
before
i
had
my
morning
tea
and
a
cigarette
i
groped
for
the
bell
jeeves
came
in
looking
as
fresh
as
a
dewy
violet
it
a
mystery
to
me
how
he
does
it
tea
jeeves
very
good
sir
he
flowed
silently
out
of
the
room
he
always
gives
you
the
impression
of
being
some
liquid
substance
when
he
moves
and
i
found
that
rocky
was
surging
round
with
his
beastly
letter
again
what
is
it
i
said
what
on
earth
the
matter
read
it
i
ca
i
have
had
my
tea
well
listen
then
who
it
from
my
aunt
at
this
point
i
fell
asleep
again
i
woke
to
hear
him
saying
so
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
jeeves
trickled
in
with
the
tray
like
some
silent
stream
meandering
over
its
mossy
bed
and
i
saw
daylight
read
it
again
rocky
old
top
i
said
i
want
jeeves
to
hear
it
todd
aunt
has
written
him
a
rather
rummy
letter
jeeves
and
we
want
your
advice
very
good
sir
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
registering
devotion
to
the
cause
and
rocky
started
again
my
dear
i
have
been
thinking
things
over
for
a
long
while
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
have
been
very
thoughtless
to
wait
so
long
before
doing
what
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
do
now
what
do
you
make
of
that
jeeves
it
seems
a
little
obscure
at
present
sir
but
no
doubt
it
becomes
cleared
at
a
later
point
in
the
communication
it
becomes
as
clear
as
mud
said
rocky
proceed
old
scout
i
said
champing
my
bread
and
butter
you
know
how
all
my
life
i
have
longed
to
visit
new
york
and
see
for
myself
the
wonderful
gay
life
of
which
i
have
read
so
much
i
fear
that
now
it
will
be
impossible
for
me
to
fulfil
my
dream
i
am
old
and
worn
out
i
seem
to
have
no
strength
left
in
me
sad
jeeves
what
extremely
sir
sad
nothing
said
rocky
it
sheer
laziness
i
went
to
see
her
last
christmas
and
she
was
bursting
with
health
her
doctor
told
me
himself
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
her
whatever
but
she
will
insist
that
she
a
hopeless
invalid
so
he
has
to
agree
with
her
she
got
a
fixed
idea
that
the
trip
to
new
york
would
kill
her
so
though
been
her
ambition
all
her
life
to
come
here
she
stays
where
she
is
rather
like
the
chappie
whose
heart
was
the
highlands
of
the
deer
jeeves
the
cases
are
in
some
respects
parallel
sir
carry
on
rocky
dear
boy
so
i
have
decided
that
if
i
can
not
enjoy
all
the
marvels
of
the
city
myself
i
can
at
least
enjoy
them
through
you
i
suddenly
thought
of
this
yesterday
after
reading
a
beautiful
poem
in
the
sunday
paper
about
a
young
man
who
had
longed
all
his
life
for
a
certain
thing
and
won
it
in
the
end
only
when
he
was
too
old
to
enjoy
it
it
was
very
sad
and
it
touched
me
a
thing
interpolated
rocky
bitterly
that
i
not
been
able
to
do
in
ten
years
as
you
know
you
will
have
my
money
when
i
am
gone
but
until
now
i
have
never
been
able
to
see
my
way
to
giving
you
an
allowance
i
have
now
decided
to
do
so
on
one
condition
i
have
written
to
a
firm
of
lawyers
in
new
york
giving
them
instructions
to
pay
you
quite
a
substantial
sum
each
month
my
one
condition
is
that
you
live
in
new
york
and
enjoy
yourself
as
i
have
always
wished
to
do
i
want
you
to
be
my
representative
to
spend
this
money
for
me
as
i
should
do
myself
i
want
you
to
plunge
into
the
gay
prismatic
life
of
new
york
i
want
you
to
be
the
life
and
soul
of
brilliant
supper
parties
above
all
i
want
you
indeed
i
insist
on
this
to
write
me
letters
at
least
once
a
week
giving
me
a
full
description
of
all
you
are
doing
and
all
that
is
going
on
in
the
city
so
that
i
may
enjoy
at
what
my
wretched
health
prevents
my
enjoying
for
myself
remember
that
i
shall
expect
full
details
and
that
no
detail
is
too
trivial
to
your
affectionate
aunt
isabel
rockmetteller
what
about
it
said
rocky
what
about
it
i
said
yes
what
on
earth
am
i
going
to
do
it
was
only
then
that
i
really
got
on
to
the
extremely
rummy
attitude
of
the
chappie
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
quite
unexpected
mess
of
the
right
stuff
had
suddenly
descended
on
him
from
a
blue
sky
to
my
mind
it
was
an
occasion
for
the
beaming
smile
and
the
joyous
whoop
yet
here
the
man
was
looking
and
talking
as
if
fate
had
swung
on
his
solar
plexus
it
amazed
me
are
you
bucked
i
said
bucked
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
be
frightfully
braced
i
consider
this
pretty
soft
for
you
he
gave
a
kind
of
yelp
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
and
then
began
to
talk
of
new
york
in
a
way
that
reminded
me
of
jimmy
mundy
the
reformer
chappie
jimmy
had
just
come
to
new
york
on
a
campaign
and
i
had
popped
in
at
the
garden
a
couple
of
days
before
for
half
an
hour
or
so
to
hear
him
he
had
certainly
told
new
york
some
pretty
straight
things
about
itself
having
apparently
taken
a
dislike
to
the
place
but
by
jove
you
know
dear
old
rocky
made
him
look
like
a
publicity
agent
for
the
old
pretty
soft
he
cried
to
have
to
come
and
live
in
new
york
to
have
to
leave
my
little
cottage
and
take
a
stuffy
smelly
hole
of
an
apartment
in
this
festering
gehenna
to
have
to
mix
night
after
night
with
a
mob
who
think
that
life
is
a
sort
of
vitus
dance
and
imagine
that
they
having
a
good
time
because
they
making
enough
noise
for
six
and
drinking
too
much
for
ten
i
loathe
new
york
bertie
i
would
come
near
the
place
if
i
had
got
to
see
editors
occasionally
there
a
blight
on
it
it
got
moral
delirium
tremens
it
the
limit
the
very
thought
of
staying
more
than
a
day
in
it
makes
me
sick
and
you
call
this
thing
pretty
soft
for
me
i
felt
rather
like
lot
friends
must
have
done
when
they
dropped
in
for
a
quiet
chat
and
their
genial
host
began
to
criticise
the
cities
of
the
plain
i
had
no
idea
old
rocky
could
be
so
eloquent
it
would
kill
me
to
have
to
live
in
new
york
he
went
on
to
have
to
share
the
air
with
six
million
people
to
have
to
wear
stiff
collars
and
decent
clothes
all
the
time
to
he
started
good
lord
i
suppose
i
should
have
to
dress
for
dinner
in
the
evenings
what
a
ghastly
notion
i
was
shocked
absolutely
shocked
my
dear
chap
i
said
reproachfully
do
you
dress
for
dinner
every
night
bertie
jeeves
i
said
coldly
the
man
was
still
standing
like
a
statue
by
the
door
how
many
suits
of
evening
clothes
have
i
we
have
three
suits
full
of
evening
dress
sir
two
dinner
jackets
three
for
practical
purposes
two
only
sir
if
you
remember
we
can
not
wear
the
third
we
have
also
seven
white
waistcoats
and
shirts
four
dozen
sir
and
white
ties
the
first
two
shallow
shelves
in
the
chest
of
drawers
are
completely
filled
with
our
white
ties
sir
i
turned
to
rocky
you
see
the
chappie
writhed
like
an
electric
fan
i
wo
do
it
i
ca
do
it
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
it
how
on
earth
can
i
dress
up
like
that
do
you
realize
that
most
days
i
get
out
of
my
pyjamas
till
five
in
the
afternoon
and
then
i
just
put
on
an
old
sweater
i
saw
jeeves
wince
poor
chap
this
sort
of
revelation
shocked
his
finest
feelings
then
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
said
that
what
i
want
to
know
you
might
write
and
explain
to
your
aunt
i
might
if
i
wanted
her
to
get
round
to
her
lawyer
in
two
rapid
leaps
and
cut
me
out
of
her
will
i
saw
his
point
what
do
you
suggest
jeeves
i
said
jeeves
cleared
his
throat
respectfully
the
crux
of
the
matter
would
appear
to
be
sir
that
todd
is
obliged
by
the
conditions
under
which
the
money
is
delivered
into
his
possession
to
write
miss
rockmetteller
long
and
detailed
letters
relating
to
his
movements
and
the
only
method
by
which
this
can
be
accomplished
if
todd
adheres
to
his
expressed
intention
of
remaining
in
the
country
is
for
todd
to
induce
some
second
party
to
gather
the
actual
experiences
which
miss
rockmetteller
wishes
reported
to
her
and
to
convey
these
to
him
in
the
shape
of
a
careful
report
on
which
it
would
be
possible
for
him
with
the
aid
of
his
imagination
to
base
the
suggested
correspondence
having
got
which
off
the
old
diaphragm
jeeves
was
silent
rocky
looked
at
me
in
a
helpless
sort
of
way
he
has
been
brought
up
on
jeeves
as
i
have
and
he
is
on
to
his
curves
could
he
put
it
a
little
clearer
bertie
he
said
i
thought
at
the
start
it
was
going
to
make
sense
but
it
kind
of
flickered
what
the
idea
my
dear
old
man
perfectly
simple
i
knew
we
could
stand
on
jeeves
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
get
somebody
to
go
round
the
town
for
you
and
take
a
few
notes
and
then
you
work
the
notes
up
into
letters
that
it
is
it
jeeves
precisely
sir
the
light
of
hope
gleamed
in
rocky
eyes
he
looked
at
jeeves
in
a
startled
way
dazed
by
the
man
vast
intellect
but
who
would
do
it
he
said
it
would
have
to
be
a
pretty
smart
sort
of
man
a
man
who
would
notice
things
jeeves
i
said
let
jeeves
do
it
but
would
he
you
would
do
it
would
you
jeeves
for
the
first
time
in
our
long
connection
i
observed
jeeves
almost
smile
the
corner
of
his
mouth
curved
quite
a
quarter
of
an
inch
and
for
a
moment
his
eye
ceased
to
look
like
a
meditative
fish
i
should
be
delighted
to
oblige
sir
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
already
visited
some
of
new
york
places
of
interest
on
my
evening
out
and
it
would
be
most
enjoyable
to
make
a
practice
of
the
pursuit
fine
i
know
exactly
what
your
aunt
wants
to
hear
about
rocky
she
wants
an
earful
of
cabaret
stuff
the
place
you
ought
to
go
to
first
jeeves
is
reigelheimer
it
on
street
anybody
will
show
you
the
way
jeeves
shook
his
head
pardon
me
sir
people
are
no
longer
going
to
reigelheimer
the
place
at
the
moment
is
frolics
on
the
roof
you
see
i
said
to
rocky
leave
it
to
jeeves
he
knows
it
is
often
that
you
find
an
entire
group
of
your
happy
in
this
world
but
our
little
circle
was
certainly
an
example
of
the
fact
that
it
can
be
done
we
were
all
full
of
beans
everything
went
absolutely
right
from
the
start
jeeves
was
happy
partly
because
he
loves
to
exercise
his
giant
brain
and
partly
because
he
was
having
a
corking
time
among
the
bright
lights
i
saw
him
one
night
at
the
midnight
revels
he
was
sitting
at
a
table
on
the
edge
of
the
dancing
floor
doing
himself
remarkably
well
with
a
fat
cigar
and
a
bottle
of
the
best
i
never
imagined
he
could
look
so
nearly
human
his
face
wore
an
expression
of
austere
benevolence
and
he
was
making
notes
in
a
small
book
as
for
the
rest
of
us
i
was
feeling
pretty
good
because
i
was
fond
of
old
rocky
and
glad
to
be
able
to
do
him
a
good
turn
rocky
was
perfectly
contented
because
he
was
still
able
to
sit
on
fences
in
his
pyjamas
and
watch
worms
and
as
for
the
aunt
she
seemed
tickled
to
death
she
was
getting
broadway
at
pretty
long
range
but
it
seemed
to
be
hitting
her
just
right
i
read
one
of
her
letters
to
rocky
and
it
was
full
of
life
but
then
rocky
letters
based
on
jeeves
notes
were
enough
to
buck
anybody
up
it
was
rummy
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
there
was
i
loving
the
life
while
the
mere
mention
of
it
gave
rocky
a
tired
feeling
yet
here
is
a
letter
i
wrote
to
a
pal
of
mine
in
london
dear
freddie
well
here
i
am
in
new
york
it
not
a
bad
place
i
not
having
a
bad
time
everything
pretty
all
right
the
cabarets
are
bad
do
know
when
i
shall
be
back
everybody
yours
bertie
seen
old
ted
lately
not
that
i
cared
about
ted
but
if
i
had
dragged
him
in
i
have
got
the
confounded
thing
on
to
the
second
page
now
here
old
rocky
on
exactly
the
same
subject
dearest
aunt
isabel
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
enough
for
giving
me
the
opportunity
to
live
in
this
astounding
city
new
york
seems
more
wonderful
every
day
fifth
avenue
is
at
its
best
of
course
just
now
the
dresses
are
magnificent
wads
of
stuff
about
the
dresses
i
did
know
jeeves
was
such
an
authority
i
was
out
with
some
of
the
crowd
at
the
midnight
revels
the
other
night
we
took
in
a
show
first
after
a
little
dinner
at
a
new
place
on
street
we
were
quite
a
gay
party
georgie
cohan
looked
in
about
midnight
and
got
off
a
good
one
about
willie
collier
fred
stone
could
only
stay
a
minute
but
doug
fairbanks
did
all
sorts
of
stunts
and
made
us
roar
diamond
jim
brady
was
there
as
usual
and
laurette
taylor
showed
up
with
a
party
the
show
at
the
revels
is
quite
good
i
am
enclosing
a
programme
last
night
a
few
of
us
went
round
to
frolics
on
the
roof
and
so
on
and
so
forth
yards
of
it
i
suppose
it
the
artistic
temperament
or
something
what
i
mean
is
it
easier
for
a
chappie
who
used
to
writing
poems
and
that
sort
of
tosh
to
put
a
bit
of
a
punch
into
a
letter
than
it
is
for
a
chappie
like
me
anyway
no
doubt
that
rocky
correspondence
was
hot
stuff
i
called
jeeves
in
and
congratulated
him
jeeves
you
a
wonder
thank
you
sir
how
you
notice
everything
at
these
places
beats
me
i
could
tell
you
a
thing
about
them
except
that
i
had
a
good
time
it
just
a
knack
sir
well
todd
letters
ought
to
brace
miss
rockmetteller
all
right
what
undoubtedly
sir
agreed
jeeves
and
by
jove
they
did
they
certainly
did
by
george
what
i
mean
to
say
is
i
was
sitting
in
the
apartment
one
afternoon
about
a
month
after
the
thing
had
started
smoking
a
cigarette
and
resting
the
old
bean
when
the
door
opened
and
the
voice
of
jeeves
burst
the
silence
like
a
bomb
it
was
that
he
spoke
loud
he
has
one
of
those
soft
soothing
voices
that
slide
through
the
atmosphere
like
the
note
of
a
sheep
it
was
what
he
said
made
me
leap
like
a
young
gazelle
miss
rockmetteller
and
in
came
a
large
solid
female
the
situation
floored
me
i
not
denying
it
hamlet
must
have
felt
much
as
i
did
when
his
father
ghost
bobbed
up
in
the
fairway
come
to
look
on
rocky
aunt
as
such
a
permanency
at
her
own
home
that
it
did
seem
possible
that
she
could
really
be
here
in
new
york
i
stared
at
her
then
i
looked
at
jeeves
he
was
standing
there
in
an
attitude
of
dignified
detachment
the
chump
when
if
ever
he
should
have
been
rallying
round
the
young
master
it
was
now
rocky
aunt
looked
less
like
an
invalid
than
any
one
i
ever
seen
except
my
aunt
agatha
she
had
a
good
deal
of
aunt
agatha
about
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
looked
as
if
she
might
be
deucedly
dangerous
if
put
upon
and
something
seemed
to
tell
me
that
she
would
certainly
regard
herself
as
put
upon
if
she
ever
found
out
the
game
which
poor
old
rocky
had
been
pulling
on
her
good
afternoon
i
managed
to
say
how
do
you
do
she
said
mr
cohan
er
no
fred
stone
not
absolutely
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
name
wooster
bertie
wooster
she
seemed
disappointed
the
fine
old
name
of
wooster
appeared
to
mean
nothing
in
her
life
is
rockmetteller
home
she
said
where
is
he
she
had
me
with
the
first
shot
i
could
think
of
anything
to
say
i
could
tell
her
that
rocky
was
down
in
the
country
watching
worms
there
was
the
faintest
flutter
of
sound
in
the
background
it
was
the
respectful
cough
with
which
jeeves
announces
that
he
is
about
to
speak
without
having
been
spoken
to
if
you
remember
sir
todd
went
out
in
the
automobile
with
a
party
in
the
afternoon
so
he
did
jeeves
so
he
did
i
said
looking
at
my
watch
did
he
say
when
he
would
be
back
he
gave
me
to
understand
sir
that
he
would
be
somewhat
late
in
returning
he
vanished
and
the
aunt
took
the
chair
which
i
forgotten
to
offer
her
she
looked
at
me
in
rather
a
rummy
way
it
was
a
nasty
look
it
made
me
feel
as
if
i
were
something
the
dog
had
brought
in
and
intended
to
bury
later
on
when
he
had
time
my
own
aunt
agatha
back
in
england
has
looked
at
me
in
exactly
the
same
way
many
a
time
and
it
never
fails
to
make
my
spine
curl
you
seem
very
much
at
home
here
young
man
are
you
a
great
friend
of
rockmetteller
oh
yes
rather
she
frowned
as
if
she
had
expected
better
things
of
old
rocky
well
you
need
to
be
she
said
the
way
you
treat
his
flat
as
your
own
i
give
you
my
word
this
quite
unforeseen
slam
simply
robbed
me
of
the
power
of
speech
i
been
looking
on
myself
in
the
light
of
the
dashing
host
and
suddenly
to
be
treated
as
an
intruder
jarred
me
it
was
mark
you
as
if
she
had
spoken
in
a
way
to
suggest
that
she
considered
my
presence
in
the
place
as
an
ordinary
social
call
she
obviously
looked
on
me
as
a
cross
between
a
burglar
and
the
plumber
man
come
to
fix
the
leak
in
the
bathroom
it
hurt
her
my
being
there
at
this
juncture
with
the
conversation
showing
every
sign
of
being
about
to
die
in
awful
agonies
an
idea
came
to
me
tea
the
good
old
would
you
care
for
a
cup
of
tea
i
said
tea
she
spoke
as
if
she
had
never
heard
of
the
stuff
nothing
like
a
cup
after
a
journey
i
said
bucks
you
up
puts
a
bit
of
zip
into
you
what
i
mean
is
restores
you
and
so
on
do
you
know
i
go
and
tell
jeeves
i
tottered
down
the
passage
to
jeeves
lair
the
man
was
reading
the
evening
paper
as
if
he
had
a
care
in
the
world
jeeves
i
said
we
want
some
tea
very
good
sir
i
say
jeeves
this
is
a
bit
thick
what
i
wanted
sympathy
do
you
know
sympathy
and
kindness
the
old
nerve
centres
had
had
the
deuce
of
a
shock
she
got
the
idea
this
place
belongs
to
todd
what
on
earth
put
that
into
her
head
jeeves
filled
the
kettle
with
a
restrained
dignity
no
doubt
because
of
todd
letters
sir
he
said
it
was
my
suggestion
sir
if
you
remember
that
they
should
be
addressed
from
this
apartment
in
order
that
todd
should
appear
to
possess
a
good
central
residence
in
the
city
i
remembered
we
had
thought
it
a
brainy
scheme
at
the
time
well
it
bally
awkward
you
know
jeeves
she
looks
on
me
as
an
intruder
by
jove
i
suppose
she
thinks
i
someone
who
hangs
about
here
touching
todd
for
free
meals
and
borrowing
his
shirts
yes
sir
it
pretty
rotten
you
know
most
disturbing
sir
and
there
another
thing
what
are
we
to
do
about
todd
we
got
to
get
him
up
here
as
soon
as
ever
we
can
when
you
have
brought
the
tea
you
had
better
go
out
and
send
him
a
telegram
telling
him
to
come
up
by
the
next
train
i
have
already
done
so
sir
i
took
the
liberty
of
writing
the
message
and
dispatching
it
by
the
lift
attendant
by
jove
you
think
of
everything
jeeves
thank
you
sir
a
little
buttered
toast
with
the
tea
just
so
sir
thank
you
i
went
back
to
the
she
had
moved
an
inch
she
was
still
bolt
upright
on
the
edge
of
her
chair
gripping
her
umbrella
like
a
she
gave
me
another
of
those
looks
as
i
came
in
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
for
some
reason
she
had
taken
a
dislike
to
me
i
suppose
because
i
was
george
cohan
it
was
a
bit
hard
on
a
chap
this
is
a
surprise
what
i
said
after
about
five
minutes
restful
silence
trying
to
crank
the
conversation
up
again
what
is
a
surprise
your
coming
here
do
you
know
and
so
on
she
raised
her
eyebrows
and
drank
me
in
a
bit
more
through
her
glasses
why
is
it
surprising
that
i
should
visit
my
only
nephew
she
said
put
like
that
of
course
it
did
seem
reasonable
oh
rather
i
said
of
course
certainly
what
i
mean
is
jeeves
projected
himself
into
the
room
with
the
tea
i
was
jolly
glad
to
see
him
there
nothing
like
having
a
bit
of
business
arranged
for
one
when
one
is
certain
of
one
lines
with
the
teapot
to
fool
about
with
i
felt
happier
tea
tea
tea
what
what
i
said
it
was
what
i
had
meant
to
say
my
idea
had
been
to
be
a
good
deal
more
formal
and
so
on
still
it
covered
the
situation
i
poured
her
out
a
cup
she
sipped
it
and
put
the
cup
down
with
a
shudder
do
you
mean
to
say
young
man
she
said
frostily
that
you
expect
me
to
drink
this
stuff
rather
bucks
you
up
you
know
what
do
you
mean
by
the
expression
you
up
well
makes
you
full
of
beans
you
know
makes
you
fizz
i
do
understand
a
word
you
say
you
english
are
you
i
admitted
it
she
did
say
a
word
and
somehow
she
did
it
in
a
way
that
made
it
worse
than
if
she
had
spoken
for
hours
somehow
it
was
brought
home
to
me
that
she
did
like
englishmen
and
that
if
she
had
had
to
meet
an
englishman
i
was
the
one
she
have
chosen
last
conversation
languished
again
after
that
then
i
tried
again
i
was
becoming
more
convinced
every
moment
that
you
ca
make
a
real
lively
with
a
couple
of
people
especially
if
one
of
them
lets
it
go
a
word
at
a
time
are
you
comfortable
at
your
hotel
i
said
at
which
hotel
the
hotel
you
staying
at
i
am
not
staying
at
an
hotel
stopping
with
friends
what
i
am
naturally
stopping
with
my
nephew
i
did
get
it
for
the
moment
then
it
hit
me
what
here
i
gurgled
certainly
where
else
should
i
go
the
full
horror
of
the
situation
rolled
over
me
like
a
wave
i
see
what
on
earth
i
was
to
do
i
could
explain
that
this
rocky
flat
without
giving
the
poor
old
chap
away
hopelessly
because
she
would
then
ask
me
where
he
did
live
and
then
he
would
be
right
in
the
soup
i
was
trying
to
induce
the
old
bean
to
recover
from
the
shock
and
produce
some
results
when
she
spoke
again
will
you
kindly
tell
my
nephew
to
prepare
my
room
i
wish
to
lie
down
your
nephew
the
man
you
call
jeeves
if
rockmetteller
has
gone
for
an
automobile
ride
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
wait
for
him
he
will
naturally
wish
to
be
alone
with
me
when
he
returns
i
found
myself
tottering
out
of
the
room
the
thing
was
too
much
for
me
i
crept
into
jeeves
den
jeeves
i
whispered
sir
mix
me
a
jeeves
i
feel
weak
very
good
sir
this
is
getting
thicker
every
minute
jeeves
sir
she
thinks
you
todd
man
she
thinks
the
whole
place
is
his
and
everything
in
it
i
do
see
what
you
to
do
except
stay
on
and
keep
it
up
we
ca
say
anything
or
she
get
on
to
the
whole
thing
and
i
do
want
to
let
todd
down
by
the
way
jeeves
she
wants
you
to
prepare
her
bed
he
looked
wounded
it
is
hardly
my
place
sir
i
know
i
know
but
do
it
as
a
personal
favour
to
me
if
you
come
to
that
it
hardly
my
place
to
be
flung
out
of
the
flat
like
this
and
have
to
go
to
an
hotel
what
is
it
your
intention
to
go
to
an
hotel
sir
what
will
you
do
for
clothes
good
lord
i
had
thought
of
that
can
you
put
a
few
things
in
a
bag
when
she
is
looking
and
sneak
them
down
to
me
at
the
st
aurea
i
will
endeavour
to
do
so
sir
well
i
do
think
there
anything
more
is
there
tell
todd
where
i
am
when
he
gets
here
very
good
sir
i
looked
round
the
place
the
moment
of
parting
had
come
i
felt
sad
the
whole
thing
reminded
me
of
one
of
those
melodramas
where
they
drive
chappies
out
of
the
old
homestead
into
the
snow
jeeves
i
said
sir
and
i
staggered
out
you
know
i
rather
think
i
agree
with
those
johnnies
who
insist
that
a
fellow
ought
to
be
devilish
pleased
if
he
has
a
bit
of
trouble
all
that
stuff
about
being
refined
by
suffering
you
know
suffering
does
give
a
chap
a
sort
of
broader
and
more
sympathetic
outlook
it
helps
you
to
understand
other
misfortunes
if
you
been
through
the
same
thing
yourself
as
i
stood
in
my
lonely
bedroom
at
the
hotel
trying
to
tie
my
white
tie
myself
it
struck
me
for
the
first
time
that
there
must
be
whole
squads
of
chappies
in
the
world
who
had
to
get
along
without
a
man
to
look
after
them
i
always
thought
of
jeeves
as
a
kind
of
natural
phenomenon
but
by
jove
of
course
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
there
must
be
quite
a
lot
of
fellows
who
have
to
press
their
own
clothes
themselves
and
have
got
anybody
to
bring
them
tea
in
the
morning
and
so
on
it
was
rather
a
solemn
thought
do
you
know
i
mean
to
say
ever
since
then
i
been
able
to
appreciate
the
frightful
privations
the
poor
have
to
stick
i
got
dressed
somehow
jeeves
had
forgotten
a
thing
in
his
packing
everything
was
there
down
to
the
final
stud
i
not
sure
this
make
me
feel
worse
it
kind
of
deepened
the
pathos
it
was
like
what
somebody
or
other
wrote
about
the
touch
of
a
vanished
hand
i
had
a
bit
of
dinner
somewhere
and
went
to
a
show
of
some
kind
but
nothing
seemed
to
make
any
difference
i
simply
had
the
heart
to
go
on
to
supper
anywhere
i
just
sucked
down
a
in
the
hotel
and
went
straight
up
to
bed
i
do
know
when
felt
so
rotten
somehow
i
found
myself
moving
about
the
room
softly
as
if
there
had
been
a
death
in
the
family
if
i
had
anybody
to
talk
to
i
should
have
talked
in
a
whisper
in
fact
when
the
rang
i
answered
in
such
a
sad
hushed
voice
that
the
fellow
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
said
halloa
five
times
thinking
he
had
got
me
it
was
rocky
the
poor
old
scout
was
deeply
agitated
bertie
is
that
you
bertie
oh
gosh
i
having
a
time
where
are
you
speaking
from
the
midnight
revels
we
been
here
an
hour
and
i
think
we
a
fixture
for
the
night
i
told
aunt
isabel
i
gone
out
to
call
up
a
friend
to
join
us
she
glued
to
a
chair
with
written
all
over
her
taking
it
in
through
the
pores
she
loves
it
and
i
nearly
crazy
tell
me
all
old
top
i
said
a
little
more
of
this
he
said
and
i
shall
sneak
quietly
off
to
the
river
and
end
it
all
do
you
mean
to
say
you
go
through
this
sort
of
thing
every
night
bertie
and
enjoy
it
it
simply
infernal
i
was
just
snatching
a
wink
of
sleep
behind
the
bill
of
fare
just
now
when
about
a
million
yelling
girls
swooped
down
with
toy
balloons
there
are
two
orchestras
here
each
trying
to
see
if
it
ca
play
louder
than
the
other
i
a
mental
and
physical
wreck
when
your
telegram
arrived
i
was
just
lying
down
for
a
quiet
pipe
with
a
sense
of
absolute
peace
stealing
over
me
i
had
to
get
dressed
and
sprint
two
miles
to
catch
the
train
it
nearly
gave
me
and
on
top
of
that
i
almost
got
brain
fever
inventing
lies
to
tell
aunt
isabel
and
then
i
had
to
cram
myself
into
these
confounded
evening
clothes
of
yours
i
gave
a
sharp
wail
of
agony
it
had
struck
me
till
then
that
rocky
was
depending
on
my
wardrobe
to
see
him
through
you
ruin
them
i
hope
so
said
rocky
in
the
most
unpleasant
way
his
troubles
seemed
to
have
had
the
worst
effect
on
his
character
i
should
like
to
get
back
at
them
somehow
they
given
me
a
bad
enough
time
about
three
sizes
too
small
and
something
apt
to
give
at
any
moment
i
wish
to
goodness
it
would
and
give
me
a
chance
to
breathe
i
breathed
since
seven
thank
heaven
jeeves
managed
to
get
out
and
buy
me
a
collar
that
fitted
or
i
should
be
a
strangled
corpse
by
now
it
was
touch
and
go
till
the
stud
broke
bertie
this
is
pure
hades
aunt
isabel
keeps
on
urging
me
to
dance
how
on
earth
can
i
dance
when
i
do
know
a
soul
to
dance
with
and
how
the
deuce
could
i
even
if
i
knew
every
girl
in
the
place
it
taking
big
chances
even
to
move
in
these
trousers
i
had
to
tell
her
i
hurt
my
ankle
she
keeps
asking
me
when
cohan
and
stone
are
going
to
turn
up
and
simply
a
question
of
time
before
she
discovers
that
stone
is
sitting
two
tables
away
something
got
to
be
done
bertie
you
got
to
think
up
some
way
of
getting
me
out
of
this
mess
it
was
you
who
got
me
into
it
me
what
do
you
mean
well
jeeves
then
it
all
the
same
it
was
you
who
suggested
leaving
it
to
jeeves
it
was
those
letters
i
wrote
from
his
notes
that
did
the
mischief
i
made
them
too
good
my
aunt
just
been
telling
me
about
it
she
says
she
had
resigned
herself
to
ending
her
life
where
she
was
and
then
my
letters
began
to
arrive
describing
the
joys
of
new
york
and
they
stimulated
her
to
such
an
extent
that
she
pulled
herself
together
and
made
the
trip
she
seems
to
think
she
had
some
miraculous
kind
of
faith
cure
i
tell
you
i
ca
stand
it
bertie
it
got
to
end
ca
jeeves
think
of
anything
no
he
just
hangs
round
saying
disturbing
sir
a
fat
lot
of
help
that
is
well
old
lad
i
said
after
all
it
far
worse
for
me
than
it
is
for
you
you
got
a
comfortable
home
and
jeeves
and
you
saving
a
lot
of
money
saving
money
what
do
you
mean
saving
money
why
the
allowance
your
aunt
was
giving
you
i
suppose
she
paying
all
the
expenses
now
is
she
certainly
she
is
but
she
stopped
the
allowance
she
wrote
the
lawyers
she
says
that
now
she
in
new
york
there
is
no
necessity
for
it
to
go
on
as
we
shall
always
be
together
and
simpler
for
her
to
look
after
that
end
of
it
i
tell
you
bertie
examined
the
darned
cloud
with
a
microscope
and
if
it
got
a
silver
lining
it
some
little
dissembler
but
rocky
old
top
it
too
bally
awful
you
no
notion
of
what
i
going
through
in
this
beastly
hotel
without
jeeves
i
must
get
back
to
the
flat
do
come
near
the
flat
but
it
my
own
flat
i
ca
help
that
aunt
isabel
does
like
you
she
asked
me
what
you
did
for
a
living
and
when
i
told
her
you
did
do
anything
she
said
she
thought
as
much
and
that
you
were
a
typical
specimen
of
a
useless
and
decaying
aristocracy
so
if
you
think
you
have
made
a
hit
forget
it
now
i
must
be
going
back
or
she
be
coming
out
here
after
me
next
morning
jeeves
came
round
it
was
all
so
when
he
floated
noiselessly
into
the
room
that
i
nearly
broke
down
good
morning
sir
he
said
i
have
brought
a
few
more
of
your
personal
belongings
he
began
to
unstrap
the
he
was
carrying
did
you
have
any
trouble
sneaking
them
away
it
was
not
easy
sir
i
had
to
watch
my
chance
miss
rockmetteller
is
a
remarkably
alert
lady
you
know
jeeves
say
what
you
like
this
is
a
bit
thick
is
it
the
situation
is
certainly
one
that
has
never
before
come
under
my
notice
sir
i
have
brought
the
suit
as
the
climatic
conditions
are
congenial
if
not
prevented
i
will
endeavour
to
add
the
brown
lounge
with
the
faint
green
twill
it
ca
go
on
this
sort
of
thing
jeeves
we
must
hope
for
the
best
sir
ca
you
think
of
anything
to
do
i
have
been
giving
the
matter
considerable
thought
sir
but
so
far
without
success
i
am
placing
three
silk
shirts
the
the
light
blue
and
the
mauve
in
the
first
long
drawer
sir
you
do
mean
to
say
you
ca
think
of
anything
jeeves
for
the
moment
sir
no
you
will
find
a
dozen
handkerchiefs
and
the
tan
socks
in
the
upper
drawer
on
the
left
he
strapped
the
and
put
it
on
a
chair
a
curious
lady
miss
rockmetteller
sir
you
understate
it
jeeves
he
gazed
meditatively
out
of
the
window
in
many
ways
sir
miss
rockmetteller
reminds
me
of
an
aunt
of
mine
who
resides
in
the
portion
of
london
their
temperaments
are
much
alike
my
aunt
has
the
same
taste
for
the
pleasures
of
the
great
city
it
is
a
passion
with
her
to
ride
in
hansom
cabs
sir
whenever
the
family
take
their
eyes
off
her
she
escapes
from
the
house
and
spends
the
day
riding
about
in
cabs
on
several
occasions
she
has
broken
into
the
children
savings
bank
to
secure
the
means
to
enable
her
to
gratify
this
desire
i
love
to
have
these
little
chats
with
you
about
your
female
relatives
jeeves
i
said
coldly
for
i
felt
that
the
man
had
let
me
down
and
i
was
fed
up
with
him
but
i
do
see
what
all
this
has
got
to
do
with
my
trouble
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
am
leaving
a
small
assortment
of
neckties
on
the
mantelpiece
sir
for
you
to
select
according
to
your
preference
i
should
recommend
the
blue
with
the
red
domino
pattern
sir
then
he
streamed
imperceptibly
toward
the
door
and
flowed
silently
out
i
often
heard
that
chappies
after
some
great
shock
or
loss
have
a
habit
after
they
been
on
the
floor
for
a
while
wondering
what
hit
them
of
picking
themselves
up
and
piecing
themselves
together
and
sort
of
taking
a
whirl
at
beginning
a
new
life
time
the
great
healer
and
nature
adjusting
itself
and
so
on
and
so
forth
there
a
lot
in
it
i
know
because
in
my
own
case
after
a
day
or
two
of
what
you
might
call
prostration
i
began
to
recover
the
frightful
loss
of
jeeves
made
any
thought
of
pleasure
more
or
less
a
mockery
but
at
least
i
found
that
i
was
able
to
have
a
dash
at
enjoying
life
again
what
i
mean
is
i
was
braced
up
to
the
extent
of
going
round
the
cabarets
once
more
so
as
to
try
to
forget
if
only
for
the
moment
new
york
a
small
place
when
it
comes
to
the
part
of
it
that
wakes
up
just
as
the
rest
is
going
to
bed
and
it
was
long
before
my
tracks
began
to
cross
old
rocky
i
saw
him
once
at
peale
and
again
at
frolics
on
the
roof
there
was
anybody
with
him
either
time
except
the
aunt
and
though
he
was
trying
to
look
as
if
he
had
struck
the
ideal
life
it
was
difficult
for
me
knowing
the
circumstances
to
see
that
beneath
the
mask
the
poor
chap
was
suffering
my
heart
bled
for
the
fellow
at
least
what
there
was
of
it
that
was
bleeding
for
myself
bled
for
him
he
had
the
air
of
one
who
was
about
to
crack
under
the
strain
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
aunt
was
looking
slightly
upset
also
i
took
it
that
she
was
beginning
to
wonder
when
the
celebrities
were
going
to
surge
round
and
what
had
suddenly
become
of
all
those
wild
careless
spirits
rocky
used
to
mix
with
in
his
letters
i
did
blame
her
i
had
only
read
a
couple
of
his
letters
but
they
certainly
gave
the
impression
that
poor
old
rocky
was
by
way
of
being
the
hub
of
new
york
night
life
and
that
if
by
any
chance
he
failed
to
show
up
at
a
cabaret
the
management
said
what
the
use
and
put
up
the
shutters
the
next
two
nights
i
did
come
across
them
but
the
night
after
that
i
was
sitting
by
myself
at
the
maison
pierre
when
somebody
tapped
me
on
the
and
i
found
rocky
standing
beside
me
with
a
sort
of
mixed
expression
of
wistfulness
and
apoplexy
on
his
face
how
the
chappie
had
contrived
to
wear
my
evening
clothes
so
many
times
without
disaster
was
a
mystery
to
me
he
confided
later
that
early
in
the
proceedings
he
had
slit
the
waistcoat
up
the
back
and
that
that
had
helped
a
bit
for
a
moment
i
had
the
idea
that
he
had
managed
to
get
away
from
his
aunt
for
the
evening
but
looking
past
him
i
saw
that
she
was
in
again
she
was
at
a
table
over
by
the
wall
looking
at
me
as
if
i
were
something
the
management
ought
to
be
complained
to
about
bertie
old
scout
said
rocky
in
a
quiet
sort
of
crushed
voice
we
always
been
pals
have
we
i
mean
you
know
i
do
you
a
good
turn
if
you
asked
me
my
dear
old
lad
i
said
the
man
had
moved
me
then
for
heaven
sake
come
over
and
sit
at
our
table
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
well
you
know
there
are
limits
to
the
sacred
claims
of
friendship
my
dear
chap
i
said
you
know
i
do
anything
in
reason
but
you
must
come
bertie
you
got
to
something
got
to
be
done
to
divert
her
mind
she
brooding
about
something
she
been
like
that
for
the
last
two
days
i
think
she
beginning
to
suspect
she
understand
why
we
never
seem
to
meet
anyone
i
know
at
these
joints
a
few
nights
ago
i
happened
to
run
into
two
newspaper
men
i
used
to
know
fairly
well
that
kept
me
going
for
a
while
i
introduced
them
to
aunt
isabel
as
david
belasco
and
jim
corbett
and
it
went
well
but
the
effect
has
worn
off
now
and
she
beginning
to
wonder
again
something
got
to
be
done
or
she
will
find
out
everything
and
if
she
does
i
take
a
nickel
for
my
chance
of
getting
a
cent
from
her
later
on
so
for
the
love
of
mike
come
across
to
our
table
and
help
things
along
i
went
along
one
has
to
rally
round
a
pal
in
distress
aunt
isabel
was
sitting
bolt
upright
as
usual
it
certainly
did
seem
as
if
she
had
lost
a
bit
of
the
zest
with
which
she
had
started
out
to
explore
broadway
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
rather
unpleasant
things
you
met
bertie
wooster
aunt
isabel
said
rocky
i
have
there
was
something
in
her
eye
that
seemed
to
say
out
of
a
city
of
six
million
people
why
did
you
pick
on
me
take
a
seat
bertie
what
you
have
said
rocky
and
so
the
merry
party
began
it
was
one
of
those
jolly
happy
parties
where
you
cough
twice
before
you
speak
and
then
decide
not
to
say
it
after
all
after
we
had
had
an
hour
of
this
wild
dissipation
aunt
isabel
said
she
wanted
to
go
home
in
the
light
of
what
rocky
had
been
telling
me
this
struck
me
as
sinister
i
had
gathered
that
at
the
beginning
of
her
visit
she
had
had
to
be
dragged
home
with
ropes
it
must
have
hit
rocky
the
same
way
for
he
gave
me
a
pleading
look
you
come
along
wo
you
bertie
and
have
a
drink
at
the
flat
i
had
a
feeling
that
this
was
in
the
contract
but
there
anything
to
be
done
it
seemed
brutal
to
leave
the
poor
chap
alone
with
the
woman
so
i
went
along
right
from
the
start
from
the
moment
we
stepped
into
the
taxi
the
feeling
began
to
grow
that
something
was
about
to
break
loose
a
massive
silence
prevailed
in
the
corner
where
the
aunt
sat
and
though
rocky
balancing
himself
on
the
little
seat
in
front
did
his
best
to
supply
dialogue
we
were
a
chatty
party
i
had
a
glimpse
of
jeeves
as
we
went
into
the
flat
sitting
in
his
lair
and
i
wished
i
could
have
called
to
him
to
rally
round
something
told
me
that
i
was
about
to
need
him
the
stuff
was
on
the
table
in
the
rocky
took
up
the
decanter
say
when
bertie
stop
barked
the
aunt
and
he
dropped
it
i
caught
rocky
eye
as
he
stooped
to
pick
up
the
ruins
it
was
the
eye
of
one
who
sees
it
coming
leave
it
there
rockmetteller
said
aunt
isabel
and
rocky
left
it
there
the
time
has
come
to
speak
she
said
i
can
not
stand
idly
by
and
see
a
young
man
going
to
perdition
poor
old
rocky
gave
a
sort
of
gurgle
a
kind
of
sound
rather
like
the
whisky
had
made
running
out
of
the
decanter
on
to
my
carpet
eh
he
said
blinking
the
aunt
proceeded
the
fault
she
said
was
mine
i
had
not
then
seen
the
light
but
now
my
eyes
are
open
i
see
the
hideous
mistake
i
have
made
i
shudder
at
the
thought
of
the
wrong
i
did
you
rockmetteller
by
urging
you
into
contact
with
this
wicked
city
i
saw
rocky
grope
feebly
for
the
table
his
fingers
touched
it
and
a
look
of
relief
came
into
the
poor
chappie
face
i
understood
his
feelings
but
when
i
wrote
you
that
letter
rockmetteller
instructing
you
to
go
to
the
city
and
live
its
life
i
had
not
had
the
privilege
of
hearing
mundy
speak
on
the
subject
of
new
york
jimmy
mundy
i
cried
you
know
how
it
is
sometimes
when
everything
seems
all
mixed
up
and
you
suddenly
get
a
clue
when
she
mentioned
jimmy
mundy
i
began
to
understand
more
or
less
what
had
happened
i
seen
it
happen
before
i
remember
back
in
england
the
man
i
had
before
jeeves
sneaked
off
to
a
meeting
on
his
evening
out
and
came
back
and
denounced
me
in
front
of
a
crowd
of
chappies
i
was
giving
a
bit
of
supper
to
as
a
moral
leper
the
aunt
gave
me
a
withering
up
and
down
yes
jimmy
mundy
she
said
i
am
surprised
at
a
man
of
your
stamp
having
heard
of
him
there
is
no
music
there
are
no
drunken
dancing
men
no
shameless
flaunting
women
at
his
meetings
so
for
you
they
would
have
no
attraction
but
for
others
less
dead
in
sin
he
has
his
message
he
has
come
to
save
new
york
from
itself
to
force
it
in
his
picturesque
phrase
to
hit
the
trail
it
was
three
days
ago
rockmetteller
that
i
first
heard
him
it
was
an
accident
that
took
me
to
his
meeting
how
often
in
this
life
a
mere
accident
may
shape
our
whole
future
you
had
been
called
away
by
that
telephone
message
from
belasco
so
you
could
not
take
me
to
the
hippodrome
as
we
had
arranged
i
asked
your
jeeves
to
take
me
there
the
man
has
very
little
intelligence
he
seems
to
have
misunderstood
me
i
am
thankful
that
he
did
he
took
me
to
what
i
subsequently
learned
was
madison
square
garden
where
mundy
is
holding
his
meetings
he
escorted
me
to
a
seat
and
then
left
me
and
it
was
not
till
the
meeting
had
begun
that
i
discovered
the
mistake
which
had
been
made
my
seat
was
in
the
middle
of
a
row
i
could
not
leave
without
inconveniencing
a
great
many
people
so
i
remained
she
gulped
rockmetteller
i
have
never
been
so
thankful
for
anything
else
mundy
was
wonderful
he
was
like
some
prophet
of
old
scourging
the
sins
of
the
people
he
leaped
about
in
a
frenzy
of
inspiration
till
i
feared
he
would
do
himself
an
injury
sometimes
he
expressed
himself
in
a
somewhat
odd
manner
but
every
word
carried
conviction
he
showed
me
new
york
in
its
true
colours
he
showed
me
the
vanity
and
wickedness
of
sitting
in
gilded
haunts
of
vice
eating
lobster
when
decent
people
should
be
in
bed
he
said
that
the
tango
and
the
were
devices
of
the
devil
to
drag
people
down
into
the
bottomless
pit
he
said
that
there
was
more
sin
in
ten
minutes
with
a
negro
banjo
orchestra
than
in
all
the
ancient
revels
of
nineveh
and
babylon
and
when
he
stood
on
one
leg
and
pointed
right
at
where
i
was
sitting
and
shouted
means
you
i
could
have
sunk
through
the
floor
i
came
away
a
changed
woman
surely
you
must
have
noticed
the
change
in
me
rockmetteller
you
must
have
seen
that
i
was
no
longer
the
careless
thoughtless
person
who
had
urged
you
to
dance
in
those
places
of
wickedness
rocky
was
holding
on
to
the
table
as
if
it
was
his
only
friend
he
stammered
i
i
thought
something
was
wrong
wrong
something
was
right
everything
was
right
rockmetteller
it
is
not
too
late
for
you
to
be
saved
you
have
only
sipped
of
the
evil
cup
you
have
not
drained
it
it
will
be
hard
at
first
but
you
will
find
that
you
can
do
it
if
you
fight
with
a
stout
heart
against
the
glamour
and
fascination
of
this
dreadful
city
wo
you
for
my
sake
try
rockmetteller
wo
you
go
back
to
the
country
and
begin
the
struggle
little
by
little
if
you
use
your
will
i
ca
help
thinking
it
must
have
been
that
word
will
that
roused
dear
old
rocky
like
a
trumpet
call
it
must
have
brought
home
to
him
the
realisation
that
a
miracle
had
come
off
and
saved
him
from
being
cut
out
of
aunt
isabel
at
any
rate
as
she
said
it
he
perked
up
let
go
of
the
table
and
faced
her
with
gleaming
eyes
do
you
want
me
to
go
back
to
the
country
aunt
isabel
yes
not
to
live
in
the
country
yes
rockmetteller
stay
in
the
country
all
the
time
do
you
mean
never
come
to
new
york
yes
rockmetteller
i
mean
just
that
it
is
the
only
way
only
there
can
you
be
safe
from
temptation
will
you
do
it
rockmetteller
will
you
for
my
sake
rocky
grabbed
the
table
again
he
seemed
to
draw
a
lot
of
encouragement
from
that
table
i
will
he
said
jeeves
i
said
it
was
next
day
and
i
was
back
in
the
old
flat
lying
in
the
old
with
my
feet
upon
the
good
old
table
i
had
just
come
from
seeing
dear
old
rocky
off
to
his
country
cottage
and
an
hour
before
he
had
seen
his
aunt
off
to
whatever
hamlet
it
was
that
she
was
the
curse
of
so
we
were
alone
at
last
jeeves
there
no
place
like
home
what
very
true
sir
the
jolly
old
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
what
precisely
sir
i
lit
another
cigarette
jeeves
sir
do
you
know
at
one
point
in
the
business
i
really
thought
you
were
baffled
indeed
sir
when
did
you
get
the
idea
of
taking
miss
rockmetteller
to
the
meeting
it
was
pure
genius
thank
you
sir
it
came
to
me
a
little
suddenly
one
morning
when
i
was
thinking
of
my
aunt
sir
your
aunt
the
hansom
cab
one
yes
sir
i
recollected
that
whenever
we
observed
one
of
her
attacks
coming
on
we
used
to
send
for
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
we
always
found
that
if
he
talked
to
her
a
while
of
higher
things
it
diverted
her
mind
from
hansom
cabs
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
same
treatment
might
prove
efficacious
in
the
case
of
miss
rockmetteller
i
was
stunned
by
the
man
resource
it
brain
i
said
pure
brain
what
do
you
do
to
get
like
that
jeeves
i
believe
you
must
eat
a
lot
of
fish
or
something
do
you
eat
a
lot
of
fish
jeeves
no
sir
oh
well
then
it
just
a
gift
i
take
it
and
if
you
are
born
that
way
there
no
use
worrying
precisely
sir
said
jeeves
if
i
might
make
the
suggestion
sir
i
should
not
continue
to
wear
your
present
tie
the
green
shade
gives
you
a
slightly
bilious
air
i
should
strongly
advocate
the
blue
with
the
red
domino
pattern
instead
sir
all
right
jeeves
i
said
humbly
you
know
the
end
