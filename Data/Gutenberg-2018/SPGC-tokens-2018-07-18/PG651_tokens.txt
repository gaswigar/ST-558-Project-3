of
golden

a

girt
with

garb
for
boyish

eager
she
wields
her
spade

loves
as
well

on

friendly
knee
intent
to
ask
the
tale
one

to
tell
rude

of
the
seething
outer

such
hours
a
waste

empty
of
all
delight
chat

sweet

from

that
by

are

happy

the

one
winter
night
at
nine
cold
tired
and
cross
and
muddy
i
had
come
home
too
late
to
dine
and
supper
with
cigars
and
wine
was
waiting
in
the
study
there
was
a
strangeness
in
the
room
and
something
white
and
wavy
was
standing
near
me
in
the
took
it
for
the
left
by
that
careless
slavey
but
presently
the
thing
began
to
shiver
and
to
sneeze
on
which
i
said
come
come
my
man
that
s
a
most
inconsiderate
plan
less
noise
there
if
you
please
picture
the
thing
standing
by
chair
i
ve
caught
a
cold
the
thing
replies
out
there
upon
the
i
turned
to
look
in
some
surprise
and
there
before
my
very
eyes
a
little
ghost
was
standing
he
trembled
when
he
caught
my
eye
and
got
behind
a
chair
how
came
you
here
i
said
and
why
i
never
saw
a
thing
so
shy
come
out
don
t
shiver
there
he
said
i
d
gladly
tell
you
how
and
also
tell
you
why
but
here
he
gave
a
little
bow
you
re
in
so
bad
a
temper
now
you
d
think
it
all
a
lie
and
as
to
being
in
a
fright
allow
me
to
remark
that
ghosts
have
just
as
good
a
right
in
every
way
to
fear
the
light
as
men
to
fear
the
no
plea
said
i
can
well
excuse
such
cowardice
in
you
for
ghosts
can
visit
when
they
choose
whereas
we
humans
ca
n
t
refuse
to
grant
the
he
said
a
flutter
of
alarm
is
not
unnatural
is
it
i
really
feared
you
meant
some
harm
but
now
i
see
that
you
are
calm
let
me
explain
my
visit
houses
are
classed
i
beg
to
state
according
to
the
number
of
ghosts
that
they
accommodate
the
tenant
merely
counts
as
with
coals
and
other
lumber
this
is
a
house
and
you
when
you
arrived
last
summer
may
have
remarked
a
spectre
who
was
doing
all
that
ghosts
can
do
to
welcome
the
in
villas
this
is
always
however
cheaply
rented
for
though
of
course
there
s
less
of
fun
when
there
is
only
room
for
one
ghosts
have
to
be
contented
that
spectre
left
you
on
the
since
then
you
ve
not
been
haunted
for
as
he
never
sent
us
word
twas
quite
by
accident
we
heard
that
any
one
was
wanted
a
spectre
has
first
choice
by
right
in
filling
up
a
vacancy
then
phantom
goblin
elf
and
if
all
these
fail
them
they
invite
the
nicest
ghoul
that
they
can
see
the
spectres
said
the
place
was
low
and
that
you
kept
bad
wine
so
as
a
phantom
had
to
go
and
i
was
first
of
course
you
know
i
couldn
t
well
no
doubt
said
i
they
settled
who
was
fittest
to
be
sent
yet
still
to
choose
a
brat
like
you
to
haunt
a
man
of
was
no
great
compliment
i
m
not
so
young
sir
he
replied
as
you
might
think
the
fact
is
in
caverns
by
the
and
other
places
that
i
ve
tried
i
ve
had
a
lot
of
practice
but
i
have
never
taken
yet
a
strict
domestic
part
and
in
my
flurry
i
forget
the
five
good
rules
of
etiquette
we
have
to
know
by
my
sympathies
were
warming
fast
towards
the
little
fellow
he
was
so
utterly
aghast
at
having
found
a
man
at
last
and
looked
so
scared
and
yellow
picture
in
caverns
by
the
at
least
i
said
i
m
glad
to
find
a
ghost
is
not
a
thing
but
pray
sit
down
you
ll
feel
inclined
if
like
myself
you
have
not
dined
to
take
a
snack
of
something
though
certainly
you
don
t
appear
a
thing
to
offer
to
and
then
i
shall
be
glad
to
if
you
will
say
them
loud
and
the
rules
that
you
allude
thanks
you
shall
hear
them
by
and
by
this
a
piece
of
luck
what
may
i
offer
you
said
i
well
since
you
so
kind
i
ll
try
a
little
bit
of
duck
slice
and
may
i
ask
you
for
another
drop
of
gravy
i
sat
and
looked
at
him
in
awe
for
certainly
i
never
saw
a
thing
so
white
and
wavy
and
still
he
seemed
to
grow
more
white
more
vapoury
and
seen
in
the
dim
and
flickering
light
as
he
proceeded
to
recite
his
maxims
of
picture
the
phantom
dines
canto
ii
hys
fyve
rules
my
don
t
suppose
he
said
i
m
setting
you
a
your
victim
be
in
bed
don
t
touch
the
curtains
at
his
head
but
take
them
in
the
middle
and
wave
them
slowly
in
and
out
while
drawing
them
asunder
and
in
a
minute
s
time
no
doubt
he
ll
raise
his
head
and
look
about
with
eyes
of
wrath
and
wonder
and
here
you
must
on
no
pretence
make
the
first
observation
wait
for
the
victim
to
commence
no
ghost
of
any
common
sense
begins
a
conversation
picture
ghostly
border
if
he
should
say
came
you
the
way
that
began
sir
in
such
a
case
your
course
is
the
bat
s
little
is
the
appropriate
answer
if
after
this
he
says
no
more
you
d
best
perhaps
curtail
your
and
shake
the
door
and
then
if
he
begins
to
snore
you
ll
know
the
thing
s
a
failure
by
day
if
he
should
be
at
home
or
on
a
you
merely
give
a
hollow
groan
to
indicate
the
kind
of
tone
in
which
you
mean
to
talk
but
if
you
find
him
with
his
friends
the
thing
is
rather
harder
in
such
a
case
success
depends
on
picking
up
some
or
butter
in
the
larder
with
this
you
make
a
kind
of
slide
it
answers
best
with
suet
on
which
you
must
contrive
to
glide
and
swing
yourself
from
side
to
one
soon
learns
how
to
do
it
picture
and
swing
yourself
from
side
to
side
the
second
tells
us
what
is
right
in
ceremonious
calls
burn
a
blue
or
crimson
a
thing
i
quite
forgot
scratch
the
door
or
i
said
you
ll
visit
no
more
if
you
attempt
the
guy
i
ll
have
no
bonfires
on
and
as
for
scratching
at
the
door
i
d
like
to
see
you
try
the
third
was
written
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
victim
and
tells
us
as
i
recollect
treat
him
with
a
grave
not
to
contradict
that
s
plain
said
i
as
tare
and
tret
to
any
comprehension
i
only
wish
ghosts
i
ve
met
would
not
so
forget
the
maxim
that
you
mention
perhaps
he
said
first
transgressed
the
laws
of
hospitality
all
ghosts
instinctively
detest
the
man
that
fails
to
treat
his
guest
with
proper
cordiality
picture
and
then
you
re
sure
to
catch
it
if
you
address
a
ghost
as
thing
or
strike
him
with
a
hatchet
he
is
permitted
by
the
king
to
drop
all
and
then
you
re
to
catch
it
the
fourth
prohibits
trespassing
where
other
ghosts
are
quartered
and
those
convicted
of
the
thing
unless
when
pardoned
by
the
king
must
instantly
be
slaughtered
that
simply
means
be
cut
up
small
ghosts
soon
unite
anew
the
process
scarcely
hurts
at
not
more
than
when
re
what
you
call
cut
up
by
a
review
the
fifth
is
one
you
may
prefer
that
i
should
quote
entire
king
must
be
addressed
a
simple
all
the
laws
you
wish
to
do
the
him
goblin
always
royal
i
m
getting
rather
hoarse
i
fear
after
so
much
reciting
so
if
you
don
t
object
my
dear
we
ll
try
a
glass
of
bitter
i
think
it
looks
picture
we
ll
try
a
glass
of
bitter
beer
canto
iii
scarmoges
and
did
you
really
walk
said
i
on
such
a
wretched
night
i
always
fancied
ghosts
could
if
not
exactly
in
the
sky
yet
at
a
fairish
it
s
very
well
said
he
for
kings
to
soar
above
the
earth
but
phantoms
often
find
that
like
many
other
pleasant
cost
more
than
they
are
worth
spectres
of
course
are
rich
and
so
can
buy
them
from
the
elves
but
prefer
to
keep
they
re
stupid
company
you
know
for
any
but
themselves
for
though
they
claim
to
be
exempt
from
pride
they
treat
a
phantom
as
something
quite
beneath
just
as
no
turkey
ever
dreamt
of
noticing
a
picture
the
phantom
they
seem
too
proud
said
i
to
go
to
houses
such
as
mine
pray
how
did
they
contrive
to
know
so
quickly
that
the
place
was
low
and
that
i
kept
bad
wine
inspector
kobold
came
to
the
little
ghost
began
here
i
broke
inspector
who
inspecting
ghosts
is
something
new
explain
yourself
my
man
his
name
is
kobold
said
my
guest
one
of
the
spectre
order
you
ll
very
often
see
him
dressed
in
a
yellow
gown
a
crimson
vest
and
a
with
a
border
he
tried
the
brocken
business
first
but
caught
a
sort
of
chill
so
came
to
england
to
be
nursed
and
here
it
took
the
form
of
which
he
complains
of
still
picture
and
here
it
took
the
form
of
thirst
he
says
when
rich
and
sound
warms
his
old
bones
like
nectar
and
as
the
inns
where
it
is
found
are
his
especial
we
call
him
the
i
bore
it
like
a
this
agonizing
witticism
and
nothing
could
be
sweeter
than
my
temper
till
the
ghost
began
some
most
provoking
criticism
cooks
need
not
be
indulged
in
waste
yet
still
you
d
better
teach
them
dishes
should
have
of
taste
pray
why
are
all
the
cruets
placed
where
nobody
can
reach
them
that
man
of
yours
will
never
earn
his
living
as
a
waiter
is
that
queer
supposed
to
burn
it
s
far
too
dismal
a
concern
to
call
a
moderator
the
duck
was
tender
but
the
peas
were
very
much
too
old
and
just
remember
if
you
please
the
time
you
have
toasted
cheese
don
t
let
them
send
it
cold
you
d
find
the
bread
improved
i
think
by
getting
better
flour
and
have
you
anything
to
drink
that
looks
a
less
like
ink
and
isn
t
so
sour
then
peering
round
with
curious
eyes
he
muttered
goodness
gracious
and
so
went
on
to
your
room
s
an
inconvenient
size
it
s
neither
snug
nor
spacious
that
narrow
window
i
expect
serves
but
to
let
the
dusk
but
please
said
i
to
recollect
twas
fashioned
by
an
architect
who
pinned
his
faith
on
ruskin
i
don
t
care
who
he
was
sir
or
on
whom
he
pinned
his
faith
constructed
by
whatever
law
so
poor
a
job
i
never
saw
as
i
m
a
living
wraith
what
a
cigar
how
much
are
they
a
dozen
i
growled
no
matter
what
they
are
you
re
getting
as
familiar
as
if
you
were
my
cousin
now
that
s
a
thing
will
not
and
so
i
tell
you
aha
said
he
we
re
getting
grand
taking
a
bottle
in
his
hand
i
ll
soon
arrange
for
and
here
he
took
a
careful
aim
and
gaily
cried
here
goes
i
tried
to
dodge
it
as
it
came
but
somehow
caught
it
all
the
same
exactly
on
my
nose
and
i
remember
nothing
more
that
i
can
clearly
fix
till
i
was
sitting
on
the
floor
repeating
two
and
five
are
four
but
and
are
what
really
passed
i
never
learned
nor
guessed
i
only
know
that
when
at
last
my
sense
returned
the
lamp
neglected
dimly
the
fire
was
getting
through
driving
mists
i
seemed
to
see
a
thing
that
smirked
and
smiled
and
found
that
he
was
giving
me
a
lesson
in
biography
as
if
i
were
a
child
canto
iv
hys
nouryture
oh
when
i
was
a
little
ghost
a
merry
time
had
we
each
seated
on
his
favourite
post
we
chumped
and
chawed
the
buttered
toast
they
gave
us
for
our
picture
we
chumped
and
chawed
the
buttered
toast
that
story
is
in
print
i
cried
don
t
say
it
s
not
because
it
s
known
as
well
as
bradshaw
s
guide
the
ghost
uneasily
replied
he
hardly
thought
it
was
it
s
not
in
nursery
rhymes
and
yet
i
almost
think
it
three
little
ghosteses
were
set
on
posteses
you
know
and
ate
their
buttered
i
have
the
book
so
if
you
doubt
i
turned
to
search
the
shelf
don
t
stir
he
cried
we
ll
do
without
it
i
now
remember
all
about
it
i
wrote
the
thing
myself
it
came
out
in
a
monthly
or
at
least
my
agent
said
it
did
some
literary
swell
who
saw
it
thought
it
seemed
adapted
for
the
magazine
he
edited
my
father
was
a
brownie
sir
my
mother
was
a
fairy
the
notion
had
occurred
to
her
the
children
would
be
happier
if
they
were
taught
to
vary
the
notion
soon
became
a
craze
and
when
it
once
began
she
brought
us
all
out
in
different
one
was
a
pixy
two
were
fays
another
was
a
banshee
the
fetch
and
kelpie
went
to
school
and
gave
a
lot
of
trouble
next
came
a
poltergeist
and
ghoul
and
then
two
trolls
which
broke
the
rule
a
goblin
and
a
if
that
s
a
on
the
shelf
he
added
with
a
yawn
i
ll
take
a
pinch
came
an
elf
and
then
a
phantom
that
s
myself
and
last
a
leprechaun
picture
i
stood
and
watched
them
in
the
hall
one
day
some
spectres
chanced
to
call
dressed
in
the
usual
white
i
stood
and
watched
them
in
the
hall
and
couldn
t
make
them
out
at
all
they
seemed
so
strange
a
sight
i
wondered
what
on
earth
they
were
that
looked
all
head
and
sack
but
mother
told
me
not
to
stare
and
then
she
twitched
me
by
the
hair
and
punched
me
in
the
back
since
then
i
ve
often
wished
that
i
had
been
a
spectre
born
but
what
s
the
use
he
heaved
a
sigh
are
the
and
look
on
with
scorn
my
was
soon
begun
when
i
was
barely
six
i
went
out
with
an
older
and
just
at
first
i
thought
it
fun
and
learned
a
lot
of
tricks
i
ve
haunted
dungeons
castles
wherever
i
was
sent
i
ve
often
sat
and
howled
for
hours
drenched
to
the
skin
with
driving
showers
upon
a
battlement
it
s
quite
now
to
groan
when
you
begin
to
speak
this
is
the
newest
thing
in
and
here
it
chilled
me
to
the
bone
he
gave
an
squeak
perhaps
he
added
to
ear
that
sounds
an
easy
thing
try
it
yourself
my
little
dear
it
took
something
like
a
year
with
constant
practising
and
when
you
ve
learned
to
squeak
my
man
and
caught
the
double
sob
you
re
pretty
much
where
you
began
just
try
and
gibber
if
you
can
that
s
something
a
job
tried
it
and
can
only
say
i
m
sure
you
couldn
t
do
it
ven
if
you
practised
night
and
day
unless
you
have
a
turn
that
way
and
natural
ingenuity
shakspeare
i
think
it
is
who
treats
of
ghosts
in
days
of
old
who
gibbered
in
the
roman
streets
dressed
if
you
recollect
in
they
must
have
found
it
cold
i
ve
often
spent
ten
pounds
on
stuff
in
dressing
as
a
double
but
though
it
answers
as
a
puff
it
never
has
effect
enough
to
make
it
worth
the
trouble
picture
in
dressing
as
a
double
long
bills
soon
quenched
the
little
thirst
i
had
for
being
funny
the
is
always
worst
such
heaps
of
things
you
want
at
first
one
must
be
made
of
money
for
instance
take
a
haunted
tower
with
skull
and
sheet
blue
lights
to
burn
say
two
an
hour
condensing
lens
of
extra
power
and
set
of
chains
complete
what
with
the
things
you
have
to
the
fitting
on
the
and
testing
all
the
coloured
the
outfit
of
itself
would
tire
the
patience
of
a
job
and
then
they
re
so
fastidious
the
committee
i
ve
often
known
them
make
a
fuss
because
a
ghost
was
french
or
russ
or
even
from
the
city
some
dialects
are
objected
for
one
the
brogue
is
and
then
for
all
you
have
to
do
one
pound
a
week
they
offer
you
and
find
yourself
in
bogies
canto
v
byckerment
don
t
they
consult
the
victims
though
i
said
they
should
by
rights
give
them
a
you
know
the
tastes
of
people
differ
so
especially
in
the
phantom
shook
his
head
and
smiled
consult
them
not
a
bit
twould
be
a
job
to
drive
one
wild
to
satisfy
one
single
there
d
be
no
end
to
it
of
course
you
can
t
leave
free
said
i
to
pick
and
choose
but
in
the
case
of
men
like
me
i
think
mine
host
might
fairly
be
allowed
to
state
his
he
said
it
really
wouldn
t
folk
are
so
full
of
fancies
we
visit
for
a
single
day
and
whether
then
we
go
or
stay
depends
on
circumstances
and
though
we
don
t
consult
mine
host
before
the
thing
s
arranged
still
if
he
often
quits
his
post
or
is
not
a
ghost
then
you
can
have
him
changed
but
if
the
host
s
a
man
like
i
mean
a
man
of
sense
and
if
the
house
is
not
too
why
what
has
said
i
to
do
with
ghost
s
convenience
a
new
house
does
not
suit
you
it
s
such
a
job
to
trim
it
but
after
twenty
years
or
so
the
wainscotings
begin
to
go
so
twenty
is
the
to
trim
was
not
a
phrase
i
could
remember
having
heard
perhaps
i
said
you
ll
be
so
good
as
tell
me
what
is
understood
exactly
by
that
word
picture
the
wainscotings
begin
to
go
it
means
the
loosening
all
the
doors
the
ghost
replied
and
laughed
it
means
the
drilling
holes
by
scores
in
all
the
and
floors
to
make
a
thorough
draught
you
ll
sometimes
find
that
one
or
two
are
all
you
really
need
to
let
the
wind
come
whistling
but
there
ll
be
a
lot
to
do
i
faintly
gasped
indeed
if
i
d
been
rather
later
i
ll
be
bound
i
added
trying
most
unsuccessfully
to
smile
you
d
have
been
busy
all
this
while
trimming
and
beautifying
why
no
said
he
perhaps
i
should
have
stayed
another
but
still
no
ghost
that
s
any
good
without
an
introduction
would
have
ventured
to
begin
it
the
proper
thing
as
you
were
late
was
certainly
to
go
but
with
the
roads
in
such
a
state
i
got
the
s
leave
to
wait
for
half
an
hour
or
who
s
the
i
cried
instead
of
answering
my
question
well
if
you
don
t
know
he
said
either
you
never
go
to
bed
or
you
ve
a
grand
digestion
he
goes
about
and
sits
on
folk
that
eat
too
much
at
night
his
duties
are
to
pinch
and
poke
and
squeeze
them
till
they
nearly
i
said
it
serves
them
right
and
folk
who
sup
on
things
like
he
muttered
eggs
and
toasted
if
they
don
t
get
an
awful
squeeze
i
m
very
much
mistaken
he
is
immensely
fat
and
so
well
suits
the
occupation
in
point
of
fact
if
you
must
know
we
used
to
call
him
years
ago
mayor
and
picture
he
goes
about
and
sits
on
folk
the
day
he
was
elected
mayor
i
that
every
sprite
meant
to
vote
for
but
did
not
he
was
so
frantic
with
despair
and
furious
with
excitement
picture
he
ran
to
tell
the
king
when
it
was
over
for
a
whim
he
ran
to
tell
the
king
and
being
the
reverse
of
slim
a
trot
was
not
for
him
a
very
easy
thing
so
to
reward
him
for
his
run
as
it
was
baking
hot
and
he
was
over
twenty
stone
the
king
proceeded
half
in
fun
to
knight
him
on
the
twas
a
great
liberty
to
take
i
fired
up
like
a
rocket
he
did
it
just
for
punning
s
sake
the
man
says
johnson
that
would
make
a
pun
would
pick
a
pocket
a
man
said
he
is
not
a
i
argued
for
a
while
and
did
my
best
to
prove
the
the
phantom
merely
listening
with
a
contemptuous
smile
at
last
when
breath
and
patience
spent
i
had
recourse
to
your
he
said
is
excellent
you
call
it
of
course
you
re
only
joking
picture
the
phantom
sitting
on
chair
stung
by
his
cold
and
snaky
eye
i
roused
myself
at
length
to
say
at
least
i
do
defy
the
veriest
sceptic
to
deny
that
union
is
strength
that
s
true
enough
said
he
yet
i
listened
in
all
is
strength
i
m
bound
to
say
in
fact
the
thing
s
as
clear
as
day
but
are
a
canto
vi
dyscomfyture
as
one
who
strives
a
hill
to
climb
who
never
climbed
before
who
finds
it
in
a
little
time
grow
every
moment
less
sublime
and
votes
the
thing
a
bore
yet
having
once
begun
to
try
dares
not
desert
his
quest
but
climbing
ever
keeps
his
eye
on
one
small
hut
against
the
sky
wherein
he
hopes
to
rest
who
climbs
till
nerve
and
force
are
spent
with
many
a
puff
and
pant
who
still
as
rises
the
ascent
in
language
grows
more
violent
although
in
breath
more
scant
who
climbing
gains
at
length
the
place
that
crowns
the
upward
track
and
entering
with
unsteady
pace
receives
a
buffet
in
the
face
that
lands
him
on
his
back
picture
decorative
border
of
man
climbing
hall
and
feels
himself
like
one
in
sleep
glide
swiftly
down
again
a
helpless
weight
from
steep
to
steep
till
with
a
headlong
giddy
sweep
he
drops
upon
the
so
i
that
had
resolved
to
bring
conviction
to
a
ghost
and
found
it
quite
a
different
thing
from
any
human
arguing
yet
dared
not
quit
my
post
but
keeping
still
the
end
in
view
to
which
i
hoped
to
come
i
strove
to
prove
the
matter
true
by
putting
everything
i
knew
into
an
axiom
commencing
every
single
phrase
with
therefore
or
because
i
blindly
reeled
a
hundred
ways
about
the
syllogistic
maze
unconscious
where
i
was
quoth
he
that
s
regular
don
t
bluster
any
more
now
be
cool
and
take
a
nap
such
a
ridiculous
old
chap
was
never
seen
before
you
re
like
a
man
i
used
to
meet
who
got
one
day
so
furious
in
arguing
the
simple
heat
scorched
both
his
slippers
off
his
feet
i
said
s
very
picture
scorched
both
his
slippers
off
his
feet
well
it
curious
i
agree
and
sounds
perhaps
like
fibs
but
still
it
s
true
as
true
can
as
sure
as
your
name
s
tibbs
said
he
i
said
my
name
s
tibbs
he
tone
became
a
shade
or
two
less
why
no
said
i
my
proper
name
is
tibbets
aye
the
why
then
you
re
not
the
party
with
that
he
struck
the
board
a
blow
that
shivered
half
the
glasses
why
couldn
t
you
have
told
me
so
three
quarters
of
an
hour
ago
you
prince
of
all
the
asses
to
walk
four
miles
through
mud
and
rain
to
spend
the
night
in
smoking
and
then
to
find
that
it
s
in
and
i
ve
to
do
it
all
it
s
really
provoking
don
t
talk
he
cried
as
i
began
to
mutter
some
excuse
who
can
have
patience
with
a
man
that
s
got
no
more
discretion
than
an
idiotic
goose
picture
to
walk
four
miles
through
mud
and
rain
to
keep
me
waiting
here
instead
of
telling
me
at
once
that
this
was
not
the
house
he
said
there
that
ll
off
to
bed
don
t
gape
like
that
you
dunce
it
s
very
fine
to
throw
the
blame
on
in
such
a
fashion
why
didn
t
you
enquire
my
name
the
very
minute
that
you
came
i
answered
in
a
passion
of
course
it
worries
you
a
bit
to
come
so
far
on
but
how
was
to
blame
for
it
well
well
said
he
i
must
admit
that
isn
t
badly
put
and
certainly
you
ve
given
me
the
best
of
wine
and
excuse
my
violence
said
he
but
accidents
like
this
you
see
they
put
one
out
a
little
twas
fault
after
all
i
shake
hands
old
the
name
was
hardly
to
my
mind
but
as
no
doubt
he
meant
it
kind
i
let
the
matter
drop
old
when
i
am
gone
perhaps
they
ll
send
you
some
inferior
sprite
who
ll
keep
you
in
a
constant
fright
and
spoil
your
soundest
naps
tell
him
you
ll
stand
no
sort
of
trick
then
if
he
leers
and
chuckles
you
just
be
handy
with
a
stick
mind
that
it
s
pretty
hard
and
thick
and
rap
him
on
the
knuckles
then
carelessly
remark
old
coon
perhaps
you
re
not
aware
that
if
you
don
t
behave
you
ll
soon
be
chuckling
to
another
and
so
you
d
best
take
care
that
s
the
right
way
to
cure
a
sprite
of
such
like
but
gracious
me
it
s
getting
light
old
a
nod
and
he
was
gone
picture
the
ghost
canto
vii
sad
souvenaunce
picture
or
can
i
have
been
drinking
what
s
this
i
pondered
have
i
slept
or
can
i
have
been
drinking
but
soon
a
gentler
feeling
crept
upon
me
and
i
sat
and
wept
an
hour
or
so
like
winking
no
need
for
bones
to
hurry
so
i
sobbed
in
fact
i
doubt
if
it
was
worth
his
while
to
and
who
is
tibbs
i
d
like
to
know
to
make
such
work
about
if
tibbs
is
anything
like
me
it
s
i
said
he
won
t
be
to
be
dropped
in
upon
at
three
after
he
s
snug
in
bed
and
if
bones
plagues
him
squeaking
and
all
the
rest
of
it
as
he
was
doing
here
just
prophesy
there
ll
be
a
row
and
tibbs
will
have
the
best
of
it
picture
and
tibbs
will
have
the
best
of
it
then
as
my
tears
could
never
bring
the
friendly
phantom
back
it
seemed
to
me
the
proper
thing
to
mix
another
glass
and
sing
the
following
coronach
art
thou
of
duckling
tea
and
meerschaum
and
hues
of
life
are
dull
and
sweets
of
life
thou
me
instead
of
singing
verse
the
third
i
rather
but
after
such
a
splendid
word
i
felt
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
try
it
any
farther
so
with
a
yawn
i
went
my
way
to
seek
the
welcome
downy
and
slept
and
dreamed
till
break
of
day
of
poltergeist
and
fetch
and
fay
and
leprechaun
and
brownie
for
years
i
ve
not
been
visited
by
any
kind
of
sprite
yet
still
they
echo
in
my
head
those
parting
words
so
kindly
said
old
picture
the
ghost
echoes
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
was
eight
years
old
she
said
every
ringlet
lightly
shaken
ran
itself
in
golden
thread
she
took
her
little
porringer
of
me
she
shall
not
win
renown
for
the
baseness
of
its
nature
shall
have
strength
to
drag
her
down
sisters
and
brothers
little
maid
there
stands
the
inspector
at
thy
door
like
a
dog
he
hunts
for
boys
who
know
not
two
and
two
are
kind
words
are
more
than
coronets
she
said
and
wondering
looked
at
me
it
is
the
dead
unhappy
night
and
i
must
hurry
home
to
a
sea
dirge
picture
the
sea
beach
and
children
there
are
certain
a
spider
a
ghost
the
gout
an
umbrella
for
that
i
hate
but
the
thing
that
i
hate
the
most
is
a
thing
they
call
the
sea
pour
some
salt
water
over
the
ugly
i
m
sure
you
ll
allow
it
to
be
suppose
it
extended
a
mile
or
more
very
like
the
sea
beat
a
dog
till
it
howls
cruel
but
all
very
well
for
a
spree
suppose
that
he
did
so
day
and
night
would
be
like
the
sea
i
had
a
vision
of
tens
of
thousands
passed
by
all
leading
children
with
wooden
spades
and
this
was
by
the
sea
who
invented
those
spades
of
wood
who
was
it
cut
them
out
of
the
tree
none
i
think
but
an
idiot
or
one
that
loved
the
sea
it
is
pleasant
and
dreamy
no
doubt
to
float
with
thoughts
as
boundless
and
souls
as
free
but
suppose
you
are
very
unwell
in
the
boat
how
do
you
like
the
sea
picture
and
this
was
by
the
sea
there
is
an
insect
that
people
avoid
whence
is
derived
the
verb
to
flee
where
have
you
been
by
it
most
annoyed
in
lodgings
by
the
sea
if
you
like
your
coffee
with
sand
for
dregs
a
decided
hint
of
salt
in
your
tea
and
a
fishy
taste
in
the
very
by
all
means
choose
the
sea
and
if
with
these
dainties
to
drink
and
eat
you
prefer
not
a
vestige
of
grass
or
tree
and
a
chronic
state
of
wet
in
your
feet
recommend
the
sea
for
have
friends
who
dwell
by
the
pleasant
friends
they
are
to
me
it
is
when
i
am
with
them
i
wonder
most
that
anyone
likes
the
sea
they
take
me
a
walk
though
tired
and
stiff
to
climb
the
heights
i
madly
agree
and
after
a
tumble
or
so
from
the
cliff
they
kindly
suggest
the
sea
i
try
the
rocks
and
i
think
it
cool
that
they
laugh
with
such
an
excess
of
glee

i
must
beg
the
candid
reader
to
confine
his
criticism
to
its
treatment
of
the

from
his
shoulder
hiawatha
took
the
camera
of
rosewood
made
of
sliding
folding
rosewood
neatly
put
it
all
together
in
its
case
it
lay
compactly
folded
into
nearly
nothing
but
he
opened
out
the
hinges
pushed
and
pulled
the
joints
and
hinges
till
it
looked
all
squares
and
oblongs
like
a
complicated
figure
in
the
second
book
of
euclid
picture
the

this
he
perched
upon

beneath

dusky
stretched
his

beg

mystic
awful
was
the
process
all
the
family
in
order
sat
before
him
for
their
pictures
each
in
turn
as
he
was
taken
volunteered
his
own
suggestions
his
ingenious
suggestions
first
the
governor
the
father
he
suggested
velvet
curtains
looped
about
a
massy
pillar
and
the
corner
of
a
table
of
a
rosewood
he
would
hold
a
scroll
of
something
hold
it
firmly
in
his
he
would
keep
his
buried
like
napoleon
in
his
waistcoat
he
would
contemplate
the
distance
with
a
look
of
pensive
meaning
as
of
ducks
that
die
ill
tempests
grand
heroic
was
the
notion
yet
the
picture
failed
entirely
failed
because
he
moved
a
little
moved
because
he
couldn
t
help
it
picture
first
the
governor
the
father
next
his
better
half
took
courage
would
have
her
picture
taken
she
came
dressed
beyond
description
dressed
in
jewels
and
in
satin
far
too
gorgeous
for
an
empress
gracefully
she
sat
down
sideways
with
a
simper
scarcely
human
holding
in
her
hand
a
bouquet
rather
larger
than
a
cabbage
all
the
while
that
she
was
sitting
still
the
lady
chattered
chattered
like
a
monkey
in
the
forest

she
asked
him

my
face
enough
in
profile
shall
i
hold
the
bouquet
higher
will
it
came
into
the
picture
and
the
picture
failed
completely
picture
next
the
son
the
next
the
son
the
he
suggested
curves
of
beauty
curves
pervading
all
his
figure
which
the
eye
might
follow
onward
till
they
centered
in
the
centered
in
the
golden
he
had
learnt
it
all
from
ruskin
author
of
the
stones
of
venice
seven
lamps
of
architecture
modern
painters
and
some
others
and
perhaps
he
had
not
fully
understood
his
author
s
meaning
but
whatever
was
the
reason
all
was
fruitless
as
the
picture
ended
in
an
utter
failure
picture
next
to
him
the
eldest
daughter
next
to
him
the
eldest
daughter
she
suggested
very
little
only
asked
if
he
would
take
her
with
her
look
of
passive
her
idea
of
passive
beauty
was
a
squinting
of
the
was
a
drooping
of
the
was
a
smile
that
went
up
sideways
to
the
corner
of
the
nostrils
hiawatha
when
she
asked
him
took
no
notice
of
the
question
looked
as
if
he
hadn
t
heard
it
but
when
pointedly
appealed
to
smiled
in
his
peculiar
manner
coughed
and
said
it
didn
t
matter
bit
his
lip
and
changed
the
subject
nor
in
this
was
he
mistaken
as
the
picture
failed
completely
so
in
turn
the
other
sisters
picture
last
the
youngest
son
was
taken
last
the
youngest
son
was
taken
very
rough
and
thick
his
hair
was
very
round
and
red
his
face
was
very
dusty
was
his
jacket
very
fidgety
his
manner
and
his
overbearing
sisters
called
him
names
he
disapproved
of
called
him
johnny
daddy
s
darling
called
him
jacky
scrubby
and
so
awful
was
the
picture
in
comparison
the
others
seemed
to
one
s
bewildered
fancy
to
have
partially
succeeded
finally
my
hiawatha
tumbled
all
the
tribe
together
grouped
is
not
the
right
expression
and
as
happy
chance
would
have
it
did
at
last
obtain
a
picture
where
the
faces
all
succeeded
each
came
out
a
perfect
likeness
then
they
joined
and
all
abused
it
unrestrainedly
abused
it
as
the
worst
and
ugliest
picture
they
could
possibly
have
dreamed
of
giving
one
such
strange
sullen
stupid
pert
expressions
really
any
one
would
take
us
any
one
that
did
not
know
us
for
the
most
unpleasant
people
hiawatha
seemed
to
think
so
seemed
to
think
it
not
unlikely
all
together
rang
their
voices
angry
loud
discordant
voices
as
of
dogs
that
howl
in
concert
as
of
cats
that
wail
in
chorus
but
my
hiawatha
s
patience
his
politeness
and
his
patience
unaccountably
had
vanished
and
he
left
that
happy
party
neither
did
he
leave
them
slowly
with
the
calm
deliberation
the
intense
deliberation
of
a
photographic
artist
but
he
left
them
in
a
hurry
left
them
in
a
mighty
hurry
stating
that
he
would
not
stand
it
stating
in
emphatic
language
what
he
d
be
before
he
d
stand
it
hurriedly
he
packed
his
boxes
hurriedly
the
porter
trundled
on
a
barrow
all
his
boxes
hurriedly
he
took
his
ticket
hurriedly
the
train
received
him
thus
departed
hiawatha
picture
thus
departed
hiawatha
melancholetta
with
saddest
music
all
day
long
she
soothed
her
secret
sorrow
at
night
she
sighed
i
fear
twas
wrong
such
cheerful
words
to
borrow
dearest
a
sweeter
sadder
song
i
ll
sing
to
thee
i
thanked
her
but
i
could
not
say
that
i
was
glad
to
hear
it
i
left
the
house
at
break
of
day
and
did
not
venture
near
it
till
time
i
hoped
had
worn
away
her
grief
for
nought
could
cheer
it
picture
at
night
she
signed
my
dismal
sister
couldst
thou
know
the
wretched
home
thou
keepest
thy
brother
drowned
in
daily
woe
is
thankful
when
thou
sleepest
for

i
laugh
however
low
when
thou

thou

i
took
my
sister
t
other
day
excuse
the
slang
expression
to
sadler
s
wells
to
see
the
play
in
hopes
the
new
impression
might
in
her
thoughts
from
grave
to
gay
effect
some
slight
digression
i
asked
three
gay
young
dogs
from
town
to
join
us
in
our
folly
whose
mirth
i
thought
might
serve
to
drown
my
sister
s
melancholy
the
lively
jones
the
sportive
brown
and
robinson
the
jolly
the
maid
announced
the
meal
in
tones
that
i
myself
had
taught
her

to
allay
my
sister
s
moans
like
oil
on
troubled
water
i
rushed
to
jones
the
lively
jones
and
begged
him
to
escort
her
vainly

strove
with
ready
wit
to
joke
about
the

ventilate
the

to
quote
the
price
of
she
groaned
here
i
and

let
us
lament
together
i
urged
you
re
wasting
time
you
know
delay
will
spoil
the
my
heart
is
wasted
with
my
woe
there
is
no
venice
on
the
bridge
of
sighs
she
quoted
low
from
byron
and
from
tennyson
i
need
not
tell
of
soup
and
fish
in
solemn
silence
swallowed
the
sobs
that
ushered
in
each
dish
and
its
departure
followed
nor
yet
my
suicidal
wish
to
the
cheese
i
hollowed
some
desperate
attempts
were
made
to
start
a
conversation
madam
the
sportive
brown
essayed
which
kind
of
recreation
hunting
or
fishing
have
you
made
your
special
occupation
her
lips
curved
downwards
instantly
as
if
of
hounds
full
i
like
said
she
oh
how
i
longed
to
snub
her
of
fish
a
whale
s
the
one
for
me
is
so
full
of
the
night
s
performance
was
king
it
s
dull
she
wept
and
awhile
i
let
her
tears
flow
on
she
said
they
soothed
her
woe
so
at
length
the
curtain
rose
upon
bombastes
in
vain
we
roared
in
vain
we
tried
to
rouse
her
into
laughter
her
pensive
glances
wandered
wide
from
orchestra
to
upon
she
said
and
sighed
and
silence
followed
after
picture
sighing
at
the
table
a
valentine
sent
to
a
friend
who
had
complained
that
i
was
glad
enough
to
see
him
when
he
came
but
didn
t
seem
to
miss
him
if
he
stayed
away
and
can
not
pleasures
while
they
last
be
actual
unless
when
past
they
leave
us
shuddering
and
aghast
with
anguish
smarting
and
can
not
friends
be
firm
and
fast
and
yet
bear
parting
and
must
i
then
at
friendship
s
call
calmly
resign
the
little
all
trifling
i
grant
it
is
and
small
i
have
of
gladness
and
lend
my
being
to
the
thrall
of
gloom
and
sadness
and
think
you
that
i
should
be
dumb
and
full
excepting
when
choose
to
come
and
share
my
dinner
at
other
times
be
sour
and
glum
and
daily
thinner
must
he
then
only
live
to
weep
who
d
prove
his
friendship
true
and
deep
by
day
a
lonely
shadow
creep
at
languish
oft
raising
in
his
broken
sleep
the
moan
of
anguish
the
lover
if
for
certain
days
his
fair
one
be
denied
his
gaze
sinks
not
in
grief
and
wild
amaze
but
wiser
wooer
he
spends
the
time
in
writing
lays
and
posts
them
to
her
and
if
the
verse
flow
free
and
fast
till
even
the
poet
is
aghast
a
touching
valentine
at
last
the
post
shall
carry
when
thirteen
days
are
gone
and
past
of
february
farewell
dear
friend
and
when
we
meet
in
desert
waste
or
crowded
street
perhaps
before
this
week
shall
fleet
perhaps
i
trust
to
find
heart
the
seat
of
wasting
sorrow
the
three
voices
the
first
voice
he
trilled
a
carol
fresh
and
free
he
laughed
aloud
for
very
glee
there
came
a
breeze
from
off
the
sea
picture
there
came
a
breeze
from
off
the
sea
it
passed
athwart
the
glooming
it
fanned
his
forehead
as
he
it
lightly
bore
away
his
hat
all
to
the
feet
of
one
who
stood
like
maid
enchanted
in
a
wood
frowning
as
darkly
as
she
could
with
huge
umbrella
lank
and
brown
unerringly
she
pinned
it
down
right
through
the
centre
of
the
crown
then
with
an
aspect
cold
and
grim
regardless
of
its
battered
rim
she
took
it
up
and
gave
it
him
a
while
like
one
in
dreams
he
stood
then
faltered
forth
his
gratitude
in
words
just
short
of
being
rude
for
it
had
lost
its
shape
and
shine
and
it
had
cost
him
and
he
was
going
out
to
dine
picture
unerringly
she
pinned
it
down
to
dine
she
sneered
in
acid
tone
to
bend
thy
being
to
a
bone
clothed
in
a
radiance
not
its
own
the
trickled
to
his
chin
there
was
a
meaning
in
her
grin
that
made
him
feel
on
fire
within
term
it
not
radiance
said
he
tis
solid
nutriment
to
me
dinner
is
dinner
tea
is
and
she
yea
so
yet
wherefore
cease
let
thy
scant
knowledge
find
increase
say
men
are
men
and
geese
are
he
moaned
he
knew
not
what
to
say
the
thought
that
i
could
get
away
strove
with
the
thought
but
i
must
stay
to
dine
she
shrieked
in
to
swallow
wines
all
foam
and
froth
to
simper
at
a
say
can
thy
noble
spirit
stoop
to
join
the
gormandising
troup
who
find
a
solace
in
the
soup
canst
thou
desire
or
pie
or
puff
thy
manners
were
enough
without
such
gross
material
yet
men
he
faintly
said
are
not
willing
to
be
fed
nor
are
they
well
without
the
her
visage
scorched
him
ere
she
spoke
there
are
she
said
a
kind
of
folk
who
have
no
horror
of
a
joke
such
wretches
live
they
take
their
share
of
common
earth
and
common
air
we
come
across
them
here
and
there
we
grant
is
no
a
sort
of
shape
suggestive
of
the
in
all
such
theories
said
he
one
fixed
exception
there
must
be
that
is
the
present
baffled
she
gave
a
wolfish
bark
he
aiming
blindly
in
the
dark
with
random
shaft
had
pierced
the
mark
she
felt
that
her
defeat
was
plain
yet
madly
strove
with
might
and
main
to
get
the
upper
hand
again
fixing
her
eyes
upon
the
beach
as
though
unconscious
of
his
speech
she
said
each
gives
to
more
than
he
could
not
answer
yea
or
nay
he
faltered
gifts
may
pass
yet
knew
not
what
he
meant
to
say
if
that
be
so
she
straight
replied
each
heart
with
each
doth
coincide
what
boots
it
for
the
world
is
picture
he
faltered
gifts
may
pass
away
the
world
is
but
a
thought
said
he
the
vast
unfathomable
sea
is
but
a
and
darkly
fell
her
answer
dread
upon
his
unresisting
head
like
half
a
hundredweight
of
lead
the
good
and
great
must
ever
shun
that
reckless
and
abandoned
one
who
stoops
to
perpetrate
a
pun
the
man
that
reads
the
that
goes
to
christmas
is
capable
of
crimes
he
felt
it
was
his
turn
to
speak
and
with
a
shamed
and
crimson
cheek
moaned
this
is
harder
than
bezique
but
when
she
asked
him
wherefore
so
he
felt
his
very
whiskers
glow
and
frankly
owned
i
do
not
picture
this
is
harder
than
bezique
while
like
broad
waves
of
golden
grain
or
sunlit
hues
on
cloistered
pane
his
colour
came
and
went
again
pitying
his
obvious
distress
yet
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
she
said
the
more
exceeds
the
a
truth
of
such
undoubted
weight
he
urged
and
so
extreme
in
date
it
were
superfluous
to
roused
into
sudden
passion
she
in
tone
of
cold
malignity
to
others
yea
but
not
to
but
when
she
saw
him
quail
and
quake
and
when
he
urged
for
pity
s
sake
once
more
in
gentle
tones
she
spake
thought
in
the
mind
doth
still
abide
that
is
by
intellect
supplied
and
within
that
idea
doth
hide
and
he
that
yearns
the
truth
to
know
still
further
inwardly
may
go
and
find
idea
from
notion
flow
and
thus
the
chain
that
sages
sought
is
to
a
glorious
circle
wrought
for
notion
hath
its
source
in
so
passed
they
on
with
even
pace
yet
gradually
one
might
trace
a
shadow
growing
on
his
face
picture
a
shadow
growing
on
his
face
the
second
voice
picture
they
walked
beside
the
beach
they
walked
beside
the
beach
her
tongue
was
very
apt
to
teach
and
now
and
then
he
did
beseech
she
would
abate
her
dulcet
tone
because
the
talk
was
all
her
own
and
he
was
dull
as
any
drone
she
urged
no
cheese
is
made
of
chalk
and
ceaseless
flowed
her
dreary
talk
tuned
to
the
footfall
of
a
walk
her
voice
was
very
full
and
rich
and
when
at
length
she
asked
him
which
it
mounted
to
its
highest
pitch
he
a
bewildered
answer
gave
drowned
in
the
sullen
moaning
wave
lost
in
the
echoes
of
the
cave
he
answered
her
he
knew
not
what
like
shaft
from
bow
at
random
shot
he
spoke
but
she
regarded
not
she
waited
not
for
his
reply
but
with
a
downward
leaden
eye
went
on
as
if
he
were
not
by
sound
argument
and
grave
defence
strange
questions
raised
on
why
and
whence
and
wildly
tangled
evidence
when
he
with
racked
and
whirling
brain
feebly
implored
her
to
explain
she
simply
said
it
all
again
wrenched
with
an
agony
intense
he
spake
neglecting
sound
and
sense
and
careless
of
all
consequence
which
is
to
when
with
quick
breath
and
cheeks
all
flushed
at
length
his
speech
was
somewhat
hushed
she
looked
at
him
and
he
was
crushed
it
needed
not
her
calm
reply
she
fixed
him
with
a
stony
eye
and
he
could
neither
fight
nor
fly
while
she
dissected
word
by
word
his
speech
half
guessed
at
and
half
heard
as
might
a
cat
a
little
bird
picture
he
spake
neglecting
sound
and
sense
then
having
wholly
overthrown
his
views
and
stripped
them
to
the
bone
proceeded
to
unfold
her
own
shall
man
be
man
and
shall
he
miss
of
other
thoughts
no
thought
but
this
harmonious
dews
of
sober
bliss
what
boots
it
shall
his
fevered
eye
through
towering
nothingness
descry
the
grisly
phantom
hurry
by
and
hear
dumb
shrieks
that
fill
the
air
see
mouths
that
gape
and
eyes
that
stare
and
redden
in
the
dusky
glare
the
meadows
breathing
amber
light
the
darkness
toppling
from
the
height
the
feathery
train
of
granite
night
shall
he
grown
gray
among
his
peers
through
the
thick
curtain
of
his
tears
catch
glimpses
of
his
earlier
years
picture
shall
man
be
man
and
hear
the
sounds
he
knew
of
yore
old
shufflings
on
the
sanded
floor
old
knuckles
tapping
at
the
door
yet
still
before
him
as
he
flies
one
pallid
form
shall
ever
rise
and
bodying
forth
in
glassy
eyes
the
vision
of
a
vanished
good
low
peering
through
the
tangled
wood
shall
freeze
the
current
of
his
still
from
each
fact
with
skill
uncouth
and
savage
rapture
like
a
tooth
she
wrenched
some
slow
reluctant
truth
till
like
a
silent
when
summer
suns
have
dried
the
rill
she
reached
a
full
stop
and
was
still
dead
calm
succeeded
to
the
fuss
as
when
the
loaded
omnibus
has
reached
the
railway
terminus
when
for
the
tumult
of
the
street
is
heard
the
engine
s
stifled
beat
the
velvet
tread
of
porters
feet
with
glance
that
ever
sought
the
ground
she
moved
her
lips
without
a
sound
and
every
now
and
then
she
frowned
he
gazed
upon
the
sleeping
sea
and
joyed
in
its
tranquillity
and
in
that
silence
dead
but
she
to
muse
a
little
space
did
seem
then
like
the
echo
of
a
dream
harked
back
upon
her
threadbare
theme
still
an
attentive
ear
he
lent
but
could
not
fathom
what
she
meant
she
was
not
deep
nor
eloquent
he
marked
the
ripple
on
the
sand
the
even
swaying
of
her
hand
was
all
that
he
could
understand
he
saw
in
dreams
a
where
thirteen
wretches
sat
in
gloom
thought
he
knew
for
whom
he
saw
them
drooping
here
and
there
each
feebly
huddled
on
a
chair
in
attitudes
of
blank
despair
oysters
were
not
more
mute
than
they
for
all
their
brains
were
pumped
away
and
they
had
nothing
more
to
save
one
who
groaned
three
hours
are
gone
who
shrieked
we
ll
wait
no
longer
john
tell
them
to
set
the
dinner
on
the
vision
passed
the
ghosts
were
fled
he
saw
once
more
that
woman
dread
he
heard
once
more
the
words
she
said
he
left
her
and
he
turned
aside
he
sat
and
watched
the
coming
tide
across
the
shores
so
newly
dried
picture
he
sat
and
watched
the
coming
tide
he
wondered
at
the
waters
clear
the
breeze
that
whispered
in
his
ear
the
billows
heaving
far
and
near
and
why
he
had
so
long
preferred
to
hang
upon
her
every
word
in
truth
he
said
it
was
picture
he
sits
the
third
voice
picture
quick
tears
were
raining
down
his
face
not
long
this
transport
held
its
place
within
a
little
moment
s
space
quick
tears
were
raining
down
his
face
his
heart
stood
still
aghast
with
fear
a
wordless
voice
nor
far
nor
near
he
seemed
to
hear
and
not
to
hear
tears
kindle
not
the
doubtful
spark
if
so
why
not
of
this
remark
the
bearings
are
profoundly
her
speech
he
said
hath
caused
this
pain
easier
i
count
it
to
explain
the
jargon
of
the
howling
main
or
stretched
beside
some
babbling
brook
to
con
with
inexpressive
look
an
unintelligible
low
spake
the
voice
within
his
head
in
words
imagined
more
than
said
soundless
as
ghost
s
intended
tread
if
thou
art
duller
than
before
why
quittedst
thou
the
voice
of
lore
why
not
endure
expecting
more
rather
than
that
he
groaned
aghast
i
d
writhe
in
depths
of
cavern
vast
some
loathly
vampire
s
rich
picture
he
groaned
aghast
twere
hard
it
answered
themes
immense
to
coop
within
the
narrow
fence
that
rings
scant
not
so
he
urged
nor
once
alone
but
there
was
something
in
her
tone
that
chilled
me
to
the
very
bone
her
style
was
anything
but
clear
and
most
unpleasantly
severe
her
epithets
were
very
queer
and
yet
so
grand
were
her
replies
i
could
not
choose
but
deem
her
wise
i
did
not
dare
to
criticise
nor
did
i
leave
her
till
she
went
so
deep
in
tangled
argument
that
all
my
powers
of
thought
were
a
little
whisper
inly
slid
yet
truth
is
truth
you
know
you
a
little
wink
beneath
the
lid
and
sickened
with
excess
of
dread
prone
to
the
dust
he
bent
his
head
and
lay
like
one
dead
the
whisper
left
a
breeze
lost
in
the
depths
of
leafy
left
him
by
no
means
at
his
ease
once
more
he
weltered
in
despair
with
hands
through
hair
more
tightly
clenched
than
then
they
were
when
bathed
in
dawn
of
living
red
majestic
frowned
the
mountain
head
tell
me
my
fault
was
all
he
said
when
at
high
noon
the
blazing
sky
scorched
in
his
head
each
haggard
eye
then
keenest
rose
his
weary
cry
and
when
at
eve
the
unpitying
sun
smiled
grimly
on
the
solemn
fun
alack
he
sighed
what
i
done
picture
tortured
unaided
and
alone
but
saddest
darkest
was
the
sight
when
the
cold
grasp
of
leaden
night
dashed
him
to
earth
and
held
him
tight
tortured
unaided
and
alone
thunders
were
silence
to
his
groan
bagpipes
sweet
music
to
its
tone
what
ever
thus
in
dismal
round
shall
pain
and
mystery
profound
pursue
me
like
a
sleepless
hound
with
and
eager
jaws
me
still
in
ignorance
of
the
cause
unknowing
what
i
broke
of
laws
the
whisper
to
his
ear
did
seem
like
echoed
flow
of
silent
stream
or
shadow
of
forgotten
dream
the
whisper
trembling
in
the
wind
her
fate
with
thine
was
intertwined
so
spake
it
in
his
inner
mind
picture
a
scared
dullard
gibbering
low
each
orbed
on
each
a
baleful
star
each
proved
the
other
s
blight
and
bar
each
unto
each
were
best
most
far
yea
each
to
each
was
worse
than
foe
thou
a
scared
dullard
gibbering
low
and
she
an
avalanche
of
woe
tèma
con
variaziòni
why
is
it
that
poetry
has
never
yet
been
subjected
to
that
process
of
dilution
which
has
proved
so
advantageous
to
her
music
the
diluter
gives
us
first
a
few
notes
of
some
air
then
a
dozen
bars
of
his
own
then
a
few
more
notes
of
the
air
and
so
on
alternately
thus
saving
the
listener
if
not
from
all
risk
of
recognising
the
melody
at
all
at
least
from
the
transports
which
it
might
produce
in
a
more
concentrated
form
the
process
is
termed
setting
by
composers
and
any
one
that
has
ever
experienced
the
emotion
of
being
unexpectedly
set
down
in
a
heap
of
mortar
will
recognise
the
truthfulness
of
this
happy
phrase
for
truly
just
as
the
genuine
epicure
lingers
lovingly
over
a
morsel
of
supreme
every
fibre
seems
to
murmur
excelsior
swallows
ere
returning
to
the
toothsome
dainty
great
mouthfuls
of
and
winkles
and
just
as
the
perfect
connoisseur
in
claret
permits
himself
but
one
delicate
sip
and
then
tosses

or
more

picture
child
on

man
s
knee
how
shall
i
be
a
poet
how
shall
i
write
in
rhyme
you
told
me
once
the
very
wish
partook
of
the
then
tell
me
how
don
t
put
me
off
with
your
another
time
the
old
man
smiled
to
see
him
to
hear
his
sudden
sally
he
liked
the
lad
to
speak
his
mind
enthusiastically
and
thought
there
s
no
in
him
nor
any
and
would
you
be
a
poet
before
you
ve
been
to
school
ah
well
i
hardly
thought
you
so
absolute
a
fool
first
learn
to
be
a
very
simple
rule
for
first
you
write
a
sentence
and
then
you
chop
it
small
then
mix
the
bits
and
sort
them
out
just
as
they
chance
to
fall
the
order
of
the
phrases
makes
no
difference
at
all
then
if
you
d
be
impressive
remember
what
i
say
that
abstract
qualities
begin
with
capitals
alway
the
true
the
good
the
those
are
the
things
that
pay
next
when
you
are
describing
a
shape
or
sound
or
tint
don
t
state
the
matter
plainly
but
put
it
in
a
hint
and
learn
to
look
at
all
things
with
a
sort
of
mental
for
instance
if
i
wished
sir
of
to
tell
should
i
say
dreams
of
fleecy
flocks
pent
in
a
wheaten
cell
why
yes
the
old
man
said
that
phrase
would
answer
very
well
then
fourthly
there
are
epithets
that
suit
with
any
as
well
as
harvey
s
reading
sauce
with
fish
or
flesh
or
of
these
wild
lonely
weary
strange
are
much
to
be
and
will
it
do
o
will
it
do
to
take
them
in
a
as
the
wild
man
went
his
weary
way
to
a
strange
and
lonely
pump
nay
nay
you
must
not
hastily
to
such
conclusions
jump
picture
the
wild
man
went
his
weary
way
such
epithets
like
pepper
give
zest
to
what
you
write
and
if
you
strew
them
sparely
they
whet
the
appetite
but
if
you
lay
them
on
too
thick
you
spoil
the
matter
quite
last
as
to
the
arrangement
your
reader
you
should
show
him
must
take
what
information
he
can
get
and
look
for
no
mature
disclosure
of
the
drift
and
purpose
of
your
poem
therefore
to
test
his
how
much
he
can
mention
no
places
names
or
dates
and
evermore
be
sure
throughout
the
poem
to
be
found
consistently

fix
upon
the

to
which
it

i

becomes

i
don

it
is

then
his

added

then
proudly
smiled
that
old
man
to
see
the
eager
lad
rush
madly
for
his
pen
and
ink
and
for
his
but
when
he
thought
of
his
face
grew
stern
and
sad
picture
his
face
grew
stern
and
sad
size
and
tears
picture
when
on
the
sandy
shore
i
sit
when
on
the
sandy
shore
i
sit
beside
the
salt
and
fall
into
a
weeping
fit
because
i
dare
not
a
little
whisper
at
my
ear
enquires
the
reason
of
my
fear
i
answer
if
that
ruffian
jones
should
recognise
me
here
he
d
bellow
out
my
name
in
tones
offensive
to
the
ear
he
chaffs
me
so
on
being
stout
a
thing
that
always
puts
me
out
ah
me
i
see
him
on
the
cliff
farewell
farewell
to
hope
if
he
should
look
this
way
and
if
he
s
got
his
telescope
to
whatsoever
place
i
flee
my
odious
rival
follows
me
for
every
night
and
everywhere
i
meet
him
out
at
dinner
and
when
i
ve
found
some
charming
fair
and
vowed
to
die
or
win
her
the
wretch
he
s
thin
and
i
am
stout
is
sure
to
come
and
cut
me
out
picture
he
s
thin
and
i
am
stout
the
girls
just
like
them
all
agree
to
praise
jones
esquire
i
ask
them
what
on
earth
they
see
about
him
to
admire
they
cry
he
is
so
sleek
and
slim
it
s
quite
a
treat
to
look
at
him
they
vanish
in
tobacco
smoke
those
visionary
i
feel
a
sharp
and
sudden
poke
between
the

my
boy
your
growing
stout
i
told
you
he
would
find
me
out
my
growth
is
not
business
sir
no
more
it
is
my
boy

if
it
s
as
i

i
give
you

prospers

is
just
the

to

for

as
yours

here
on
this
spot
in
that
summer
of
yore
atalanta
did
not
vote
my
presence
a
bore
nor
reply
to
my
tenderest
talk
she
had
heard
all
that
nonsense
she
d
the
brooch
i
had
bought
and
the
necklace
and
sash
on
and
her
heart
as
i
thought
was
alive
to
my
passion
and
she
d
done
up
her
hair
in
the
style
that
the
empress
had
brought
into
fashion
i
had
been
to
the
play
with
my
pearl
of
a
but
for
all
i
could
say
she
declared
she
was
weary
that
the
place
was
so
crowded
and
hot
and
she
couldn
t
abide
that
picture
on
this
spot
then
i
thought
lucky
boy
tis
for
that
she
whimpers
and
i
noted
with
joy
those
sensational
simpers
and
i
said
this
is
scrumptious
phrase
i
had
learned
from
the
devonshire
shrimpers
and
i
vowed
twill
be
said
i
m
a
fortunate
fellow
when
the
breakfast
is
spread
when
the
topers
are
mellow
when
the
foam
of
the

white
and
the
fierce
are
yellow

that
languishing
yawn
o
those
eloquent
eyes
i
was
drunk
with
the
dawn
of
a
splendid
i
was
stung
by
a
look
i
was
slain
by
a
tear
by
a
tempest
of
sighs
then
i
whispered
i
see
the
sweet
secret
thou
keepest
and
the
yearning
for
that
thou
wistfully
weepest
and
the
question
is
license
or
banns
though
undoubtedly
banns
are
the
be

hero

i
lost

two
charades

written
at
the
request
of
some
young
friends
who
had
gone
to
a
ball
at
an
oxford
also
as
a
specimen
of
what
might
be
done
by
making
the
double
acrostic
connected
instead
of
what
it
has
hitherto
been
a
string
of
disjointed
stanzas
on
every
conceivable
subject
and
about
as
interesting
to
read
straight
through
as
a
page
of
a
cyclopædia

first
two

two
main
words

subsequent
stanza

there
was
an
ancient
city
stricken
down
with
a
strange
frenzy
and
for
many
a
day
they
paced
from
morn
to
eve
the
crowded
town
and
danced
the
night
away
i
asked
the
cause
the
aged
man
grew
sad
they
pointed
to
a
building
gray
and
tall
and
hoarsely
answered
step
inside
my
lad
and
then
you
ll
see
it
yet
what
are
all
such
gaieties
to
me
whose
thoughts
are
full
of
indices
and
surds
but
something
whispered
it
will
soon
be
done
bands
can
not
always
play
nor
ladies
smile
endure
with
patience
the
distasteful
fun
for
just
a
little
while
a
change
came
o
er
my
was
night
we
clove
a
pathway
through
a
frantic
throng
the
steeds
filled
us
with
affright
the
chariots
whirled
along
within
a
marble
hall
a
river
a
living
tide
half
muslin
and
half
cloth
and
here
one
mourned
a
broken
wreath
or
fan
yet
swallowed
down
her
wrath
and
here
one
offered
to
a
thirsty
fair
his
words
amid
those
thunders
tuneful
some
frozen
viand
there
were
many
there
a
in
each
spoonful
there
comes
a
happy
pause
for
human
strength
will
not
endure
to
dance
without
cessation
and
every
one
must
reach
the
point
at
length
of
absolute
prostration
at
such
a
moment
ladies
learn
to
give
to
partners
who
would
urge
them
a
flat
and
yet
decided
photographers
love
such
there
comes
a
welcome
revives
and
fading
eyes
grow
bright
and
pulses
quicken
incessant
pop
the
corks
and
busy
knives
dispense
the
tongue
and
chicken
flushed
with
new
life
the
crowd
flows
back
again
and
all
is
tangled
talk
and
mazy
much
like
a
waving
field
of
golden
grain
or
a
tempestuous
ocean
and
thus
they
give
the
time
that
nature
meant
for
peaceful
sleep
and
meditative
snores
to
ceaseless
din
and
mindless
merriment
and
waste
of
shoes
and
floors
and
one
we
name
him
not
that
flies
the
flowers
that
dreads
the
dances
and
that
shuns
the
salads
they
doom
to
pass
in
solitude
the
hours
writing
how
late
it
grows
the
hour
is
surely
past
that
should
have
warned
us
with
its
double
knock
the
twilight
wanes
and
morning
comes
at
oh
uncle
what
s
o
clock
the
uncle
gravely
nods
and
wisely
winks
it
mean
much
but
how
is
one
to
know
he
opens
his
out
of
it
methinks
no
words
of
wisdom
flow
ii
empress
of
art
for
thee
i
twine
this
wreath
with
all
too
slender
skill
forgive
my
muse
each
halting
line
and
for
the
deed
accept
the
will
o
day
of
tears
whence
comes
this
spectre
grim
parting
like
death
s
cold
river
souls
that
love
is
not
he
bound
to
thee
as
thou
to
him
by
vows
unwhispered
here
yet
heard
above
and
still
it
lives
that
keen
and
heavenward
flame
lives
in
his
eye
and
trembles
in
his
tone
and
these
wild
words
of
fury
but
proclaim
a
heart
that
beats
for
thee
for
thee
alone
but
all
is
lost
that
mighty
mind
o
erthrown
like
sweet
bells
jangled
piteous
sight
to
see
doubt
that
the
stars
are
fire
so
runs
his
moan
doubt
truth
herself
but
not
my
love
for
thee
a
sadder
vision
yet
thine
aged
sire
shaming
his
hoary
locks
with
treacherous
wile
and
dost
thou
now
doubt
truth
to
be
a
liar
and
wilt
thou
die
that
hast
forgot
to
smile
nay
get
thee
hence
leave
all
thy
winsome
ways
and
the
faint
fragrance
of
thy
scattered
flowers
in
holy
silence
wait
the
appointed
days
and
weep
away
the
hours
iii
the
air
is
bright
with
hues
of
light
and
rich
with
laughter
and
with
singing
young
hearts
beat
high
in
ecstasy
and
banners
wave
and
bells
are
ringing
but
silence
falls
with
fading
day
and
there
s
an
end
to
mirth
and
play
ah
rest
your
old
bones
ye
wrinkled
crones
the
kettle

firelight

the
magic
draught

fills
the

not

are
