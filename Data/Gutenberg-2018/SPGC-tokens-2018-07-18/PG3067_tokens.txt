hard
cash
like
the
cloister
and
the
hearth
is
a
romance
that
is
a
fiction
built
on
truths
and
these
truths
have
been
gathered
by
long
severe
systematic
labour
from
a
multitude
of
volumes
pamphlets
journals
reports
manuscript
narratives
letters
and
living
people
whom
i
have
sought
out
examined
and
to
get
at
the
truth
on
each
main
topic
i
have
striven
to
handle
the
madhouse
scenes
have
been
picked
out
by
certain
disinterested
gentlemen
who
keep
private
asylums
and
periodicals
to
puff
them
and
have
been
met
with
bold
denials
of
public
facts
and
with
timid
personalities
and
a
little
easy
cant
about
novelists
but
in
reality
those
passages
have
been
written
on
the
same
system
as
the
nautical
legal
and
other
scenes
the
best
evidence
has
been
ransacked
and
a
large
portion
of
this
evidence
i
shall
be
happy
to
show
at
my
house
to
any
brother
writer
who
is
disinterested
and

cares
enough

this
slang
term
is
not
quite
accurate
as
applied
to
me
without
sensation
there
can
be
no
interest
but
my
plan
is
to
mix
a
little
character
and
a
little
philosophy
with
the
sensational
element
hard
cash
prologue
in
a
snowy
villa
with
a
sloping
lawn
just
outside
the
great
commercial
seaport
barkington
there
lived
a
few
years
ago
a
happy
family
a
lady
but
still
charming
two
young
friends
of
hers
and
a
periodical
visitor
the
lady
was
dodd
her
occasional
visitor
was
her
husband
her
friends
were
her
son
edward
aged
twenty
and
her
daughter
julia
nineteen
the
fruit
of
a
misalliance
dodd
was
originally
miss
fountain
a
young
lady
well
born
high
bred
and
a
denizen
of
the
fashionable
world
under
a
strange
concurrence
of
circumstances
she
coolly
married
the
captain
of
an
east
indiaman
the
deed
done
and
with
her
eyes
open
for
she
was
not
to
say
in
love
with
him
she
took
a
judicious
line
and
kept
it
no
hankering
after
mayfair
no
talking
about
lord
this
and
lady
that
to
commercial
gentlewomen
no
amphibiousness
she
accepted
her
place
in
society
reserving
the
right
to
embellish
it
with
the
graces
she
had
gathered
in
a
higher
sphere
in
her
home
and
in
her
person
she
was
little
less
elegant
than
a
countess
yet
nothing
more
than
a
wife
and
she
reared
that
commander
children
in
a
suburban
villa
with
the
manners
which
adorn
a
palace
when
they
happen
to
be
there
she
had
a
bugbear
slang
could
not
endure
the
smart
technicalities
current
their
multitude
did
not
overpower
her
distaste
she
called
them
jargon
slang
was
too
coarse
a
word
for
her
to
apply
to
slang
she
excluded
many
a
good
racy
idiom
along
with
the
real
offenders
and
monosyllables
in
general
ran
some
risk
of
having
to
show
their
passports
if
this
was
pedantry
it
went
no
further
she
was
open
free
and
youthful
with
her
young
pupils
and
had
the
art
to
put
herself
on
their
level
often
when
they
were
quite
young
she
would
feign
infantine
ignorance
in
order
to
hunt
trite
truth
in
couples
with
them
and
detect
by
joint
experiment
that
rainbows
can
not
or
else
will
not
be
walked
into
nor
be
gathered
like
a
cowslip
and
that
dissect
we
the
vocal
dog
whose
hair
is
so
like
a
lamb
never
so
skilfully
no
fragment
of
palpable
bark
no
sediment
of
tangible
squeak
remains
inside
him
to
bless
the
inquisitive
little
operator
when
they
advanced
from
these
elementary
branches
to
languages
history
tapestry
and
what
not
she
managed
still
to
keep
by
their
side
learning
with
them
not
just
hearing
them
lessons
down
from
the
top
of
a
high
tower
of
maternity
she
never
checked
their
curiosity
but
made
herself
share
it
never
gave
them
as
so
many
parents
do
a
answer
wooed
their
affections
with
subtle
though
innocent
art
thawed
their
reserve
obtained
their
love
and
retained
their
respect
briefly
a
female
chesterfield
her
husband
lover
after
marriage
though
not
before
and
the
mild
monitress
the
elder
sister
the
favourite
companion
and
bosom
friend
of
both
her
children
they
were
remarkably
dissimilar
and
perhaps
i
may
be
allowed
to
preface
the
narrative
of
their
adventures
by
a
delineation
as
in
country
churches
an
individual
pipes
the
keynote
and
the
tune
comes
raging
after
edward
then
had
a
great
calm
eye
that
was
always
looking
folk
full
in
the
face
mildly
his
countenance
comely
and
manly
but
no
more
too
square
for
apollo
but
sufficed
for
john
bull
his
figure
it
was
that
charmed
the
curious
observer
of
male
beauty
he
was
five
feet
ten
had
square
shoulders
a
deep
chest
masculine
flank
small
foot
high
instep
to
crown
all
this
a
head
overflowed
by
ripples
of
dark
brown
hair
sat
with
heroic
grace
upon
his
solid
white
throat
like
some
glossy
falcon
new
lighted
on
a
parian
column
this
young
gentleman
had
decided
qualities
positive
and
negative
he
could
walk
up
to
a
gate
and
clear
it
alighting
on
the
other
side
like
a
fallen
feather
could
row
all
day
and
then
dance
all
night
could
fling
a
cricket
ball
a
hundred
and
six
yards
had
a
lathe
and
a
and
would
make
you
in
a
trice
a
chair
a
table
a
doll
a
nutcracker
or
any
other
moveable
useful
or
the
very
reverse
and
could
not
learn
his
lessons
to
save
his
life
his
sister
julia
was
not
so
easy
to
describe
her
figure
was
tall
lithe
and
serpentine
her
hair
the
colour
of
a
fresh
from
its
pod
her
ears
tiny
and
her
eyelashes
long
and
silky
her
mouth
small
when
grave
large
when
smiling
her
eyes
pure
hazel
by
day
and
tinged
with
a
little
violet
by
night
but
in
jotting
down
these
details
true
as
they
are
i
seem
to
myself
to
be
painting
fire
with
a
little
snow
and
saffron
mixed
on
a
marble
pallet
there
is
a
beauty
too
spiritual
to
be
chained
in
a
string
of
items
and
fair
features
were
but
the
china
vessel
that
brimmed
over
with
the
higher
loveliness
of
her
soul
her
essential
charm
was
what
shall
i
say
transparence
you
would
have
said
her
very
body
modesty
intelligence
and
above
all
enthusiasm
shone
through
her
and
out
of
her
and
made
her
an
airy
fiery
household
joy
briefly
an
incarnate
sunbeam
this
one
could
learn
her
lessons
with
unreasonable
rapidity
and
until
edward
went
to
eton
would
insist
upon
learning
his
into
the
bargain
partly
with
the
fond
notion
of
coaxing
him
on
as
the
company
of
a
swift
horse
incites
a
slow
one
partly
because
she
was
determined
to
share
his
every
trouble
if
she
could
not
remove
it
a
little
choleric
and
indeed
downright
prone
to
that
more
generous
indignation
which
fires
at
the
wrongs
of
others
when
heated
with
emotion
or
sentiment
she
lowered
her
voice
instead
of
raising
it
like
the
rest
of
us
she
called
her
mother
lady
placid
and
her
brother
sir
and
so
much
for
outlines
dodd
laid
aside
her
personal
ambition
with
her
maiden
name
but
she
looked
high
for
her
children
perhaps
she
was
all
the
more
ambitious
for
them
that
they
had
no
rival
aspirant
in
dodd
she
educated
julia
herself
from
first
to
last
but
with
true
feminine
distrust
of
her
power
to
mould
a
lordling
of
creation
she
sent
edward
to
eton
at
nine
this
was
slackening
her
tortoise
for
at
eton
is
no
female
master
to
coax
dry
knowledge
into
a
slow
head
however
he
made
good
progress
in
two
branches
aquatics
and
cricket
after
eton
came
the
choice
of
a
profession
his
mother
recognised
but
four
and
these
her
discreet
ambition
speedily
sifted
down
to
two
for
military
heroes
are
shot
now
and
then
however
pacific
the
century
and
naval
ones
drowned
she
would
never
expose
her
edward
to
this
class
of
accidents
glory
by
all
means
glory
by
the
pail
but
safe
glory
please
or
she
would
none
of
it
remained
the
church
and
the
bar
and
within
these
reasonable
limits
she
left
her
dear
boy
free
as
air
and
not
even
hurried
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
choose
he
must
pass
through
the
university
to
either
this
last
essential
had
been
settled
about
a
twelvemonth
and
the
very
day
for
his
going
to
oxford
was
at
hand
when
one
morning
edward
formally
cleared
his
throat
it
was
an
unusual
act
and
drew
the
ladies
eyes
upon
him
he
followed
the
solemnity
up
by
delivering
calmly
and
ponderously
a
connected
discourse
which
astonished
them
by
its
length
and
purport
mamma
dear
let
us
look
the
thing
in
the
this
was
his
favourite
expression
as
well
as
habit
i
have
been
thinking
it
quietly
over
for
the
last
six
months
why
send
me
to
the
university
i
shall
be
out
of
place
there
it
will
cost
you
a
lot
of
money
and
no
good
now
you
take
a
advice
do
you
waste
your
money
and
papa
sending
a
dull
fellow
like
me
to
oxford
i
did
bad
enough
at
make
me
an
engineer
or
something
if
you
were
not
so
fond
of
me
and
i
of
you
i
say
send
me
to
canada
with
a
pickaxe
you
know
i
have
got
no
dodd
had
sat
aghast
casting
edward
deprecating
looks
at
the
close
of
each
ponderous
sentence
but
too
polite
to
interrupt
a
soul
even
a
son
talking
nonsense
she
now
assured
him
she
could
afford
very
well
to
send
him
to
oxford
and
begged
leave
to
remind
him
that
he
was
too
good
and
too
sensible
to
run
up
bills
there
like
the
young
men
who
did
not
really
love
their
parents
then
as
for
learning
why
we
must
be
reasonable
in
our
turn
do
the
best
you
can
love
we
know
you
have
no
great
turn
for
the
classics
we
do
not
expect
you
to
take
high
honours
like
young
hardie
besides
that
might
make
your
head
ache
he
has
sad
headaches
his
sister
told
julia
but
my
dear
an
university
education
is
indispensable
do
but
see
how
the
signs
of
it
follow
a
gentleman
through
life
to
say
nothing
of
the
valuable
acquaintances
and
lasting
friendships
he
makes
there
even
those
few
distinguished
persons
who
have
risen
in
the
would
without
it
have
openly
regretted
the
want
and
have
sent
their
children
and
says
volumes
to
why
edward
it
is
the
of
a
gentleman
said
julia
eagerly
dodd
caught
a
flash
of
her
daughter
and
my
silver
shall
never
be
without
it
said
she
warmly
she
added
presently
in
her
usual
placid
tone
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dears
i
ought
to
have
said
my
with
this
she
kissed
edward
tenderly
on
the
brow
and
drew
an
embrace
and
a
little
grunt
of
resignation
from
him
take
the
dear
boy
and
show
him
our
purchases
love
said
dodd
with
a
little
gentle
accent
of
half
reproach
scarce
perceptible
to
a
male
ear
oh
yes
and
julia
rose
and
tripped
to
the
door
there
she
stood
a
moment
half
turned
with
arching
neck
colouring
with
innocent
pleasure
come
darling
oh
you
the
pair
found
a
little
room
hard
by
paved
with
china
crockery
glass
baths
kettles
there
sir
look
them
in
the
face
and
us
if
you
well
you
know
i
had
no
idea
you
had
been
and
bought
a
of
things
for
his
eye
brightened
he
whipped
out
a
rule
and
began
to
calculate
the
cubic
contents
i
turn
to
and
make
the
cases
the
ladies
had
their
way
the
cases
were
made
and
despatched
and
one
morning
the
bus
came
for
edward
and
stopped
at
the
gate
of
albion
villa
at
this
sight
mother
and
daughter
both
turned
their
heads
quickly
away
by
one
independent
impulse
and
set
a
bad
example
apparently
neither
of
them
had
calculated
on
this
paltry
little
detail
they
were
game
for
theoretical
departures
to
impalpable
universities
and
an
bus
a
bus
of
the
mind
would
not
have
dejected
for
a
moment
their
lofty
spartan
souls
on
glory
bent
safe
glory
but
here
was
a
bus
of
wood
and
edward
going
bodily
away
inside
it
the
victim
kissed
them
threw
up
his
portmanteau
and
bag
and
departed
serene
as
italian
skies
the
victors
watched
the
pitiless
bus
quite
out
of
sight
then
went
up
to
his
bedroom
all
disordered
by
packing
and
on
the
very
face
of
it
vacant
and
sat
down
on
his
little
bed
intertwining
and
weeping
edward
was
received
at
exeter
college
as
young
gentlemen
are
received
at
college
and
nowhere
else
i
hope
for
the
credit
of
christendom
they
showed
him
a
hole
in
the
roof
and
called
it
an
attic
grim
pleasantry
being
a
puncture
in
the
modern
athens
they
inserted
him
told
him
what
hour
at
the
top
of
the
morning
he
must
be
in
chapel
and
left
him
to
find
out
his
other
ills
his
cases
were
welcomed
like
christians
by
the
whole
staircase
these
undergraduates
abused
one
another
crockery
as
their
own
the
joint
stock
of
breakables
had
just
dwindled
very
low
and
dodd
bountiful
contribution
was
a
godsend
the
new
comer
soon
found
that
his
views
of
a
learned
university
had
been
narrow
out
of
place
in
it
why
he
could
not
have
taken
his
wares
to
a
better
market
the
modern
athens
like
the
ancient
cultivates
muscle
as
well
as
mind
the
captain
of
the
university
eleven
saw
a
thrown
all
across
the
ground
he
instantly
sent
a
professional
bowler
to
find
out
who
that
was
through
the
same
ambassador
the
thrower
was
invited
to
play
on
club
days
and
proving
himself
an
infallible
catch
and
a
mighty
thrower
a
swift
runner
and
a
steady
though
not
very
brilliant
bat
he
was
after
one
or
two
repulses
actually
adopted
into
the
university
eleven
he
communicated
this
ray
of
glory
by
letter
to
his
mother
and
sister
with
genuine
delight
coldly
and
clumsily
expressed
they
replied
with
feigned
and
fluent
rapture
advancing
steadily
in
that
line
of
academic
study
towards
which
his
genius
lay
he
won
a
hurdle
race
and
sent
home
a
little
silver
hurdle
and
soon
after
brought
a
pewter
pot
with
a
latin
inscription
recording
the
victory
at
fives
of
edward
dodd
but
not
too
arrogantly
for
in
the
centre
of
the
pot
was
this
device
the
lord
is
my
the
curate
of
sandford
who
pulled
number
six
in
the
exeter
boat
left
sandford
for
witney
on
this
he
felt
he
could
no
longer
do
his
college
justice
by
water
and
his
parish
by
land
nor
escape
the
charge
of
pluralism
preaching
at
witney
and
rowing
at
oxford
he
fluctuated
sighed
kept
his
witney
and
laid
down
his
oar
then
edward
was
solemnly
weighed
in
his
jersey
and
flannel
trousers
and
proving
only
eleven
stone
eight
whereas
he
had
been
ungenerously
suspected
of
twelve
stone
was
elected
to
the
vacant
oar
by
acclamation
he
was
a
picture
in
a
boat
and
oh
well
pulled
six
was
a
hearty
ejaculation
constantly
hurled
at
him
from
the
bank
by
many
men
of
other
colleges
and
even
by
the
more
genial
among
the
cads
as
the
exeter
glided
at
ease
down
the
river
or
shot
up
it
in
a
race
was
at
this
time
a
prejudice
against
weight
which
has
yielded
to
experience
he
was
now
as
much
talked
of
in
the
university
as
any
man
of
his
college
except
one
singularly
enough
that
one
was
his
townsman
but
no
friend
of
his
he
was
much
edward
senior
in
standing
though
not
in
age
and
this
is
a
barrier
the
junior
must
not
step
over
without
direct
encouragement
at
oxford
moreover
the
college
was
a
large
one
and
some
of
the
sets
very
exclusive
young
hardie
was
doge
of
a
studious
clique
and
careful
to
make
it
understood
that
he
was
a
reading
man
who
boated
and
cricketed
to
avoid
the
fatigue
of
lounging
not
a
boatman
or
cricketer
who
strayed
into
aristotle
in
the
intervals
of
perspiration
his
public
running
since
he
left
harrow
was
as
follows
the
prize
poem
in
his
fourth
term
the
sculls
in
his
sixth
the
ireland
scholarship
in
his
eighth
he
pulled
second
for
it
the
year
before
stroke
of
the
exeter
in
his
tenth
and
reckoned
sure
of
a
first
class
to
consummate
his
twofold
career
to
this
young
apollo
crowned
with
variegated
laurel
edward
looked
up
from
a
distance
the
brilliant
creature
never
bestowed
a
word
on
him
by
land
and
by
water
only
such
observations
as
the
following
time
six
well
pulled
six
very
well
pulled
six
except
one
race
when
he
swore
at
him
like
a
trooper
for
not
being
quicker
at
starting
the
excitement
of
nearly
being
bumped
by
brasenose
in
the
first
hundred
yards
was
an
excuse
however
hardie
apologised
as
they
were
dressing
in
the
barge
after
the
race
but
the
apology
was
so
stiff
it
did
not
pave
the
way
to
an
acquaintance
young
hardie
rising
thought
nothing
human
worthy
of
reverence
but
intellect
invited
to
dinner
on
the
same
day
with
the
emperor
of
russia
and
with
voltaire
and
with
meek
john
he
would
certainly
have
told
the
coachman
to
put
him
down
at
voltaire
his
quick
eye
detected
edward
character
but
was
not
attracted
by
it
says
he
to
one
of
his
adherents
what
a
spoon
that
dodd
is
phoebus
what
a
name
edward
on
the
other
hand
praised
this
brilliant
in
all
his
letters
and
recorded
his
triumphs
and
such
of
his
witty
sayings
as
leaked
through
his
own
set
to
reinvigorate
mankind
this
roused
julia
ire
it
smouldered
through
three
letters
but
burst
out
when
there
was
no
letter
but
dodd
meaning
heaven
knows
no
harm
happened
to
say
meekly
of
edward
you
know
love
we
can
not
all
be
young
no
and
thank
heaven
said
julia
defiantly
yes
mamma
she
continued
in
answer
to
eyebrow
which
had
curved
your
mild
glance
reads
my
soul
i
detest
that
dodd
smiled
are
you
sure
you
know
what
the
word
means
and
what
has
young
hardie
done
that
you
should
bestow
so
violent
a
sentiment
on
him
mamma
i
am
edward
sister
was
the
tragic
reply
then
kicking
off
the
buskin
pretty
nimbly
there
he
beats
our
boy
at
everything
and
ours
sits
quietly
down
and
admires
him
for
it
oh
how
can
a
man
let
anybody
or
anything
beat
him
i
would
without
a
desperate
she
clenched
her
white
teeth
and
imagined
the
struggle
to
be
sure
she
owned
she
had
never
seen
this
hardie
but
after
all
it
was
only
jane
hardie
brother
as
edward
was
hers
and
would
i
sit
down
and
let
jane
beat
me
at
things
never
never
never
i
your
friend
to
the
death
dear
was
not
that
your
expression
oh
that
was
a
slip
of
the
tongue
dear
mamma
i
was
off
my
guard
i
generally
am
by
the
way
but
now
i
am
on
it
and
propose
an
amendment
now
i
second
it
now
i
carry
and
now
let
me
hear
she
is
my
friend
till
death
or
eclipse
and
that
means
until
she
eclipses
me
of
but
she
added
softly
and
with
sudden
gravity
ah
jane
hardie
has
a
fault
which
will
always
prevent
her
from
eclipsing
your
humble
servant
in
this
wicked
what
is
that
she
is
too
good
par
exemple
too
oh
that
is
another
for
shame
mamma
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
for
i
scorn
a
life
of
frivolity
but
then
again
i
should
not
like
to
give
up
everything
you
dodd
looked
a
little
staggered
too
at
so
vast
a
scheme
of
capitulation
but
everything
was
soon
explained
to
mean
balls
concerts
in
general
without
exposition
of
scripture
races
and
operas
cards
charades
and
whatever
else
amuses
society
without
perceptibly
sanctifying
it
all
these
by
account
miss
hardie
had
renounced
and
was
now
denouncing
with
the
young
the
latter
verb
treads
on
the
very
heels
of
the
former
and
you
know
she
is
a
district
this
climax
delivered
julia
stopped
short
and
awaited
the
result
dodd
heard
it
all
with
quiet
disapproval
and
cool
incredulity
she
had
seen
so
many
young
ladies
healed
of
many
young
enthusiasms
by
a
wedding
ring
but
while
she
was
searching
diligently
in
her
mine
of
ladylike
english
mine
with
plenty
of
water
in
it
begging
her
pardon
for
expressions
to
convey
inoffensively
and
roundabout
her
conviction
that
miss
hardie
was
a
little
furious
simpleton
the
post
came
and
swept
the
subject
away
in
a
moment
two
letters
one
from
calcutta
one
from
oxford
they
came
quietly
in
upon
one
salver
and
were
opened
and
read
with
pleasurable
interest
but
without
surprise
or
misgiving
and
without
the
slightest
foretaste
of
their
grave
amid
singular
consequences
rivers
deep
and
broad
start
from
such
little
springs
david
letter
was
of
unusual
length
for
him
the
main
topics
were
first
the
date
and
manner
of
his
return
home
his
ship
a
very
old
one
had
been
condemned
in
port
and
he
was
to
sail
a
fine
new
vessel
the
as
far
as
the
cape
where
her
captain
just
recovered
from
a
severe
illness
would
come
on
board
and
convey
her
and
him
to
england
in
future
dodd
was
to
command
one
of
the
large
steamers
to
alexandria
and
back
it
is
rather
a
for
a
sailor
to
go
straight
ahead
like
a
wheelbarrow
in
all
weathers
with
a
and
a
crew
of
coalheavers
but
then
i
shall
not
be
parted
from
my
sweetheart
such
long
dreary
spells
as
i
have
been
thus
twenty
years
my
dear
love
so
is
it
for
me
to
complain
the
second
topic
was
pecuniary
the
transfer
of
their
savings
from
india
where
interest
was
higher
than
at
home
but
the
capital
not
so
secure
and
the
third
was
ardent
and
tender
expressions
of
affection
for
the
wife
and
children
he
adored
these
effusions
of
the
heart
had
no
separate
place
except
in
my
somewhat
arbitrary
analysis
of
the
honest
sailor
letter
they
were
the
under
current
dodd
read
part
of
it
out
to
julia
in
fact
all
but
the
money
matter
that
concerned
the
heads
of
the
family
more
immediately
and
cash
was
a
topic
her
daughter
did
not
understand
nor
care
about
and
when
dodd
had
read
it
with
glistening
eyes
she
kissed
it
tenderly
and
read
it
all
over
again
to
herself
and
then
put
it
into
her
bosom
as
naively
as
a
milkmaid
in
love
edward
letter
was
short
enough
and
dodd
allowed
julia
to
read
it
to
her
which
she
did
with
panting
breath
and
glowing
cheeks
and
a
running
fire
of
comments
mamma
i
hope
you
and
ju
are
quite
well
ju
murmured
dodd
plaintively
that
there
is
good
news
about
papa
coming
home
as
for
me
i
have
plenty
on
my
hands
just
now
all
this
term
i
have
been
scratched
out
and
another
word
put
in
c
r
oh
i
know
love
yes
that
is
the
oxfordish
for
for
smalls
dodd
contrived
to
sigh
interrogatively
julia
who
understood
her
every
accent
reminded
her
that
smalls
was
the
new
word
for
little
cramming
for
smalls
and
now
i
am
in
two
races
at
henley
and
that
rather
puts
the
snaffie
on
reading
and
gooseberry
pie
goodness
me
adds
to
my
chance
of
being
ploughed
for
smalls
what
does
it
all
mean
inquired
mamma
pie
and
snaffle
and
well
the
gooseberry
pie
is
really
too
deep
for
me
but
is
the
new
oxfordish
for
o
mamma
have
you
forgotten
that
was
vulgar
so
now
they
are
smalls
but
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
to
vex
you
and
puss
heaven
forbid
he
should
be
so
disgraced
but
what
has
the
cat
to
do
with
it
nothing
on
earth
puss
that
is
me
how
dare
he
did
i
not
forbid
all
these
nicknames
and
all
this
oxfordish
by
proclamation
last
last
long
hem
last
protracted
dear
mamma
sometimes
i
can
not
help
being
down
in
the
mouth
why
it
is
a
string
of
pearls
think
you
have
not
got
a
son
like
hardie
at
this
unfortunate
reflection
it
was
julia
turn
to
suffer
she
deposited
the
letter
in
her
lap
and
fired
up
now
have
not
i
cause
to
hate
and
scorn
and
despise
le
petit
hardie
julia
i
mean
to
dislike
with
propriety
and
gently
to
abominate
hardie
dear
mamma
do
come
to
henley
on
the
tenth
you
and
ju
the
university
eights
will
not
be
there
but
the
head
boats
of
the
oxford
and
cambridge
river
will
and
the
oxford
head
boat
is
exeter
you
know
and
i
pull
six
then
i
am
truly
sorry
to
hear
it
my
poor
boy
will
overtask
his
strength
and
how
unfair
of
the
other
young
gentlemen
it
seems
ungenerous
unreasonable
my
poor
child
against
so
and
i
am
entered
for
the
sculls
as
well
and
if
you
and
the
impetuosity
vengeance
looking
on
from
the
bank
i
do
think
i
should
be
lucky
this
time
henley
is
a
long
way
from
barkington
but
it
is
a
pretty
place
all
the
ladies
admire
it
and
like
to
see
both
the
universities
out
and
a
stunning
race
oh
well
there
an
epithet
one
would
think
thunder
was
going
to
race
lightning
instead
of
oxford
if
you
can
come
please
write
and
i
will
get
you
nice
lodgings
i
will
not
let
you
go
to
a
noisy
inn
love
to
julia
and
no
end
of
kisses
to
my
pretty
mamma
from
your
affectionate
son
dodd
they
wrote
off
a
cordial
assent
and
reached
henley
in
time
to
see
the
dullest
town
in
europe
and
also
to
see
it
turn
one
of
the
gayest
in
an
hour
or
two
so
impetuously
came
both
the
universities
pouring
into
it
in
all
known
vehicles
that
could
go
pace
by
land
and
water
chapter
i
it
was
a
bright
hot
day
in
june
dodd
and
julia
sat
half
reclining
with
their
parasols
up
in
an
open
carriage
by
the
brink
of
the
thames
at
one
of
its
loveliest
bends
about
a
furlong
up
stream
a
silvery
stone
bridge
just
mellowed
by
time
spanned
the
river
with
many
fair
arches
through
these
the
coming
river
peeped
sparkling
a
long
way
above
then
came
meandering
and
shining
down
loitered
cool
and
sombre
under
the
dark
vaults
then
glistened
on
again
crookedly
to
the
spot
where
sat
its
two
fairest
visitors
that
day
but
at
that
very
point
flung
off
its
serpentine
habits
and
shot
straight
away
in
a
broad
stream
of
scintillating
water
a
mile
long
down
to
an
island
in
a
little
fairy
island
with
old
trees
and
a
white
temple
to
curl
round
this
fairy
isle
the
broad
current
parted
and
both
silver
streams
turned
purple
in
the
shade
of
the
grove
then
winded
and
melted
from
the
sight
this
noble
and
rare
passage
of
the
silvery
thames
was
the
henley
racecourse
the
was
down
at
the
island
and
the
goal
was
up
at
a
point
in
the
river
below
the
bridge
but
above
the
bend
where
dodd
and
julia
sat
unruffled
by
the
racing
and
enjoying
luxuriously
the
glorious
stream
the
mellow
bridge
crowded
with
carriages
whose
fair
occupants
stretched
a
broad
band
of
bright
colour
above
the
dark
figures
clustering
on
the
battlements
and
the
green
meadows
opposite
with
the
motley
crowd
streaming
up
and
down
nor
was
that
sense
which
seems
especially
keen
and
delicate
in
women
left
unregaled
in
the
general
bounty
of
the
time
the
green
meadows
on
the
opposite
bank
and
the
gardens
at
the
back
of
our
fair
friends
flung
their
sweet
fresh
odours
at
their
liquid
benefactor
gliding
by
and
the
sun
himself
seemed
to
burn
perfumes
and
the
air
to
scatter
them
over
the
motley
merry
crowd
that
bright
hot
smiling
airy
day
in
june
thus
tuned
to
gentle
enjoyment
the
fair
mother
and
her
lovely
daughter
leaned
back
in
a
delicious
languor
proper
to
their
sex
and
eyed
with
unflagging
though
demure
interest
and
furtive
curiosity
the
wealth
of
youth
beauty
stature
agility
gaiety
and
good
temper
the
two
great
universities
had
poured
out
upon
those
obscure
banks
all
dressed
in
neat
but
clothes
cut
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
or
else
in
jerseys
white
or
striped
and
flannel
trousers
and
straw
hats
or
cloth
caps
of
bright
and
various
hues
betting
strolling
laughing
chaffing
larking
and
whirling
stunted
bludgeons
at
aunt
sally
but
as
for
the
sport
itself
they
were
there
to
see
the
center
of
all
these
bright
accessories
the
racing
my
ladies
did
not
understand
it
nor
try
nor
care
a
about
it
but
this
mild
dignified
indifference
to
the
main
event
received
a
shock
at
for
then
the
first
heat
for
the
cup
came
on
and
edward
was
in
it
so
then
racing
became
all
in
a
moment
a
most
interesting
pastime
an
appendage
to
loving
he
left
to
join
his
crew
and
soon
after
the
exeter
glided
down
the
river
before
their
eyes
with
the
beloved
one
rowing
quietly
in
it
his
jersey
revealed
not
only
the
working
power
of
his
arms
as
sunburnt
below
the
elbow
as
a
gipsy
and
as
corded
above
as
a
blacksmith
but
also
the
play
of
the
great
muscles
across
his
broad
and
deeply
indented
chest
his
oar
entered
the
water
smoothly
gripped
it
severely
then
came
out
clean
and
feathered
clear
and
tunably
on
the
ringing
rowlock
the
boat
jumped
and
then
glided
at
each
neat
easy
powerful
stroke
oh
how
beautiful
and
strong
he
is
cried
julia
i
had
no
presently
the
competitor
for
this
heat
came
down
the
cambridge
boat
rowed
by
a
fine
crew
in
jerseys
oh
dear
said
julia
they
are
odious
and
strong
in
this
boat
too
i
wish
i
was
in
it
with
a
gimlet
he
win
poor
which
corkscrew
staircase
to
honour
being
inaccessible
the
race
had
to
be
decided
by
two
unfeminine
trifles
called
speed
and
few
things
in
this
vale
of
tears
are
more
worthy
a
pen
of
fire
than
an
english
is
as
seen
by
the
runners
of
whom
i
have
often
been
one
but
this
race
i
am
bound
to
indicate
not
describe
i
mean
to
show
how
it
appeared
to
two
ladies
seated
on
the
henley
side
of
the
thames
nearly
opposite
the
these
fair
novices
then
looked
all
down
the
river
and
could
just
discern
two
whitish
streaks
on
the
water
one
on
each
side
the
little
fairy
isle
and
a
great
black
patch
on
the
berkshire
bank
the
threatening
streaks
were
the
two
racing
boats
the
black
patch
was
about
a
hundred
cambridge
and
oxford
men
ready
to
run
and
hallo
with
the
boats
all
the
way
or
at
least
till
the
last
puff
of
wind
should
be
run
plus
halloed
out
of
their
young
bodies
others
less
fleet
and
enduring
but
equally
clamorous
stood
in
knots
at
various
distances
ripe
for
a
shorter
yell
and
run
when
the
boats
should
come
up
to
them
of
the
natives
and
country
visitors
those
who
were
not
nailed
down
by
bounteous
fate
ebbed
and
flowed
up
and
down
the
bank
with
no
settled
idea
but
of
getting
in
the
way
as
much
as
possible
and
of
getting
knocked
into
the
thames
as
little
as
might
be
there
was
a
long
uneasy
suspense
at
last
a
puff
of
smoke
issued
from
a
pistol
down
at
the
island
two
oars
seemed
to
splash
into
the
water
from
each
white
streak
and
the
black
patch
was
moving
so
were
the
threatening
streaks
presently
was
heard
a
faint
continuous
distant
murmur
and
the
streaks
began
to
get
larger
and
larger
and
larger
and
the
eight
splashing
oars
looked
four
instead
of
two
every
head
was
now
turned
down
the
river
groups
hung
craning
over
it
like
nodding
bulrushes
next
the
runners
were
swelled
by
the
stragglers
they
picked
up
so
were
their
voices
and
on
came
the
splashing
oars
and
roaring
lungs
now
the
colours
of
the
racing
jerseys
peeped
distinct
the
heads
and
bodies
came
swinging
back
like
one
and
the
oars
seemed
to
lash
the
water
savagely
like
a
connected
row
of
swords
and
the
spray
squirted
at
each
vicious
stroke
the
boats
leaped
and
darted
side
by
side
and
looking
at
them
in
front
julia
could
not
say
which
was
ahead
on
they
came
nearer
and
nearer
with
hundreds
of
voices
vociferating
go
it
cambridge
well
pulled
oxford
you
are
gaining
hurrah
well
pulled
trinity
hurrah
oxford
cambridge
now
is
your
time
hardie
pick
her
up
oh
well
pulled
six
well
pulled

up
lift
her
a
bit
cambridge
oxford
hurrah
at
this
julia
turned
red
and
pale
by
turns
o
mamma
said
she
clasping
her
hands
and
colouring
high
would
it
be
very
wrong
if
i
was
to
for
oxford
to
win
dodd
had
a
monitory
finger
it
was
on
her
left
hand
she
raised
it
and
that
moment
as
if
she
had
given
a
signal
the
boats
no
longer
shot
out
to
treble
the
length
they
had
looked
hitherto
and
came
broadside
past
our
palpitating
fair
the
elastic
rowers
stretched
like
greyhounds
in
a
chase
darting
forward
at
each
stroke
so
boldly
they
seemed
flying
out
of
the
boats
and
surging
back
as
superbly
an
eightfold
human
wave
their
nostrils
all
open
the
lips
of
some
pale
and
glutinous
their
white
teeth
all
clenched
grimly
their
young
eyes
all
glowing
their
supple
bodies
swelling
the
muscles
writhing
beneath
their
jerseys
and
the
sinews
starting
on
each
bare
brown
arm
their
little
shrill
coxswains
shouting
imperiously
at
the
young
giants
and
working
to
and
fro
with
them
like
jockeys
at
a
finish
nine
souls
and
bodies
flung
whole
into
each
magnificent
effort
water
foaming
and
flying
rowlocks
ringing
crowd
running
tumbling
and
howling
like
mad
and
cambridge
a
boat
nose
ahead
they
had
scarcely
passed
our
two
spectators
when
oxford
put
on
a
furious
spurt
and
got
fully
even
with
the
leading
boat
there
was
a
louder
roar
than
ever
from
the
bank
cambridge
spurted
desperately
in
turn
and
stole
those
few
feet
back
and
so
they
went
fighting
every
inch
of
water
bang
a
cannon
on
the
bank
sent
its
smoke
over
both
competitors
it
dispersed
in
a
moment
and
the
boats
were
seen
pulling
slowly
towards
the
bridge
cambridge
with
four
oars
oxford
with
six
as
if
that
gum
had
winged
them
both
the
race
was
over
but
who
had
won
our
party
could
not
see
and
must
wait
to
learn
a
youth
adorned
with
a
blue
and
yellow
rosette
cried
out
in
the
hearing
of
dodd
i
say
they
are
properly
pumped
both
crews
are
then
jumping
on
to
a
spoke
of
her
with
a
slight
apology
he
announced
that
two
or
three
were
shut
up
in
the
exeter
the
exact
meaning
of
these
two
verbs
passive
was
not
clear
to
dodd
but
their
intensity
was
she
fluttered
and
wanted
to
go
to
her
boy
and
nurse
him
and
turned
two
most
imploring
eyes
on
julia
and
julia
straightway
kissed
her
with
gentle
vehemence
and
offered
to
ruin
and
see
what
amongst
all
those
young
gentlemen
love
i
fear
that
would
not
be
proper
see
all
the
ladies
remain
so
they
kept
quiet
and
miserable
after
the
manner
of
females
meantime
the
cantab
quick
eye
had
not
deceived
him
in
each
racing
boat
were
two
young
gentlemen
leaning
collapsed
over
their
oars
and
two
more
who
were
in
a
cloud
and
not
at
all
clear
whether
they
were
in
this
world
still
or
in
their
zeal
had
pulled
into
a
better
but
their
malady
was
not
a
rare
one
in
racing
boats
and
the
remedy
always
at
hand
it
combined
the
rival
systems
thames
was
sprinkled
in
their
faces
homoeopathy
and
brandy
in
a
teaspoon
trickled
down
their
throats
allopathy
youth
and
spirits
soon
did
the
rest
and
the
moment
their
eyes
opened
their
mouths
opened
and
the
moment
their
mouths
opened
they
fell
a
chaffing
dodd
anxiety
and
julia
were
relieved
by
the
appearance
of
edward
in
a
tweed
sauntering
down
to
them
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
placidly
unconscious
of
their
solicitude
on
his
account
he
was
received
with
a
little
guttural
cry
of
delight
the
misery
they
had
been
in
about
him
was
duly
concealed
from
him
by
both
and
julia
asked
him
warmly
who
had
won
oh
cambridge
why
then
you
are
beaten
puff
and
you
can
come
here
with
that
horrible
calm
and
cigar
owning
defeat
and
puffing
tranquillity
with
the
same
mouth
mamma
we
are
beaten
beaten
never
mind
said
edward
kindly
you
have
seen
a
capital
race
the
closest
ever
known
on
this
river
and
one
side
or
other
must
and
if
they
did
not
quite
win
they
very
nearly
did
observed
dodd
composedly
then
with
heartfelt
content
he
is
not
hurt
and
that
is
the
main
well
my
lady
placid
and
imperturbable
i
am
glad
neither
of
your
equanimities
is
disturbed
but
defeat
is
a
bitter
pill
to
julia
said
this
in
her
earnest
voice
and
drawing
her
scarf
suddenly
round
her
so
as
almost
to
make
it
speak
digested
her
bitter
pill
in
silence
during
which
process
several
exeter
men
caught
sight
of
edward
and
came
round
him
and
an
animated
discussion
took
place
they
began
with
asking
him
how
it
had
happened
and
as
he
never
spoke
in
a
hurry
supplied
him
with
the
answers
a
stretcher
had
broken
in
the
exeter
no
but
the
cambridge
was
a
much
better
built
boat
and
her
bottom
cleaner
the
bow
oar
of
the
exeter
was
ill
and
not
fit
for
work
each
of
these
solutions
was
advanced
and
combated
in
turn
and
then
all
together
at
last
the
babel
lulled
and
edward
was
once
more
appealed
to
well
i
will
tell
you
the
real
truth
said
he
how
it
puff
there
was
a
pause
of
expectation
for
the
young
man
tone
was
that
of
conviction
knowledge
and
authority
the
cambridge
men
pulled
faster
than
we
puff
the
hearers
stared
and
then
laughed
come
old
fellows
said
edward
never
win
a
on
dry
land
that
is
such
a
thing
to
do
gives
the
other
side
the
laugh
as
well
as
the
race
i
have
heard
a
stretcher
or
two
told
but
i
saw
none
broken
puff
their
boat
is
the
worst
i
ever
saw
it
dips
every
stroke
puff
their
strength
lies
in
the
crew
it
was
a
good
race
and
a
fair
one
cambridge
got
a
lead
and
kept
it
puff
they
beat
us
a
yard
or
two
at
rowing
but
hang
it
all
do
let
them
beat
us
at
telling
the
truth
not
by
an
puff
all
right
old
fellow
was
now
the
cry
one
observed
however
that
stroke
did
not
take
the
matter
so
coolly
as
six
for
he
had
shed
a
tear
getting
out
of
the
boat
shed
a
fiddlestick
squeaked
a
little
sceptic
no
said
another
he
did
quite
shed
it
his
pride
would
let
so
he
decanted
it
and
put
it
by
for
supper
suggested
edward
and
puffed
none
of
your
chaff
six
he
had
a
gulp
or
two
and
swallowed
the
rest
by
main
do
you
talk
you
can
swallow
anything
it
puff
well
i
believe
it
said
one
of
hardie
own
set
dodd
does
know
him
as
we
do
taff
hardie
ca
bear
to
be
when
they
were
gone
dodd
observed
dear
me
what
if
the
young
gentleman
did
cry
a
little
it
was
very
excusable
after
such
great
exertions
it
disappointing
mortifying
i
pity
him
for
one
and
wish
he
had
his
mother
alive
and
here
to
dry
where
oh
where
her
lindley
murray
gone
mamma
it
is
you
for
reading
us
cried
edward
slapping
his
thigh
well
then
since
you
can
feel
for
a
fellow
hardie
a
good
deal
cut
up
you
know
the
university
was
in
a
manner
beaten
and
he
took
the
blame
he
never
cried
that
was
a
cracker
of
those
fellows
but
he
did
give
one
great
sob
that
was
all
and
hung
his
head
on
one
side
a
moment
but
then
he
fought
out
of
it
directly
like
a
man
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
or
ought
to
have
been
hang
chatterboxes
and
what
did
you
say
to
console
him
edward
inquired
julia
warmly
what
me
console
my
senior
and
my
stroke
no
thank
at
this
thunderbolt
of
etiquette
both
ladies
kept
their
countenances
this
was
muscular
feat
that
day
and
the
racing
for
the
sculls
came
on
six
competitors
two
cambridge
three
oxford
one
london
the
three
heats
furnished
but
one
good
race
a
sharp
contest
between
a
cambridge
man
and
hardie
ending
in
favour
of
the
latter
the
londoner
walked
away
from
his
opponent
sir
imperturbable
competitor
was
impetuous
and
ran
into
him
in
the
first
hundred
yards
sir
consenting
calmly
the
umpire
appealed
to
on
the
spot
decided
that
it
was
a
foul
dodd
being
in
his
own
water
he
walked
over
the
course
and
explained
the
matter
to
his
sister
who
delivered
her
mind
thus
oh
if
races
are
to
be
won
by
going
slower
than
the
other
we
may
shine
yet
i
call
it
cheating
not
he
smiled
unmoved
she
gave
her
scarf
the
irony
twist
and
they
all
went
to
dinner
the
business
recommenced
with
a
race
between
a
london
boat
and
the
winner
of
yesterday
heat
cambridge
here
the
truth
of
edward
remark
appeared
the
cambridge
boat
was
too
light
for
the
men
and
kept
burying
her
hose
the
london
craft
under
a
heavy
crew
floated
like
a
cork
the
londoners
soon
found
out
their
advantage
and
overrating
it
steered
into
their
opponents
water
prematurely
in
spite
of
a
warning
voice
from
the
bank
cambridge
saw
and
cracked
on
for
a
foul
and
for
about
a
minute
it
was
anybody
race
but
the
londoners
pulled
gallantly
and
just
scraped
clear
ahead
this
peril
escaped
they
kept
their
backs
straight
and
a
clear
lead
to
the
finish
cambridge
followed
a
few
feet
in
their
wake
pulling
wonderfully
fast
to
the
end
but
a
trifle
out
of
form
and
much
distressed
at
this
both
universities
looked
blue
their
humble
aspiration
being
first
to
beat
off
all
the
external
world
and
then
tackle
each
other
for
the
prize
just
before
edward
left
his
friends
for
the
sculls
the
final
heat
a
note
was
brought
to
him
he
ran
his
eye
over
it
and
threw
it
open
into
his
sister
lap
the
ladies
read
it
its
writer
had
won
a
prize
poem
and
so
now
is
our
time
to
get
a
hint
for
composition
dear
sir
oxford
must
win
something
suppose
we
go
in
for
these
sculls
you
are
a
horse
that
can
stay
silcock
is
hot
for
the
lead
at
starting
i
hear
so
i
mean
to
work
him
out
of
wind
then
you
can
wait
on
us
and
pick
up
the
race
my
head
is
not
well
enough
to
win
but
i
am
good
to
pump
the
cockney
he
is
quick
but
a
little
stale
yours
truly
alfred
hardie
dodd
remarked
that
the
language
was
sadly
figurative
but
she
hoped
edward
might
be
successful
in
spite
of
his
correspondent
style
julia
said
she
did
not
dare
hope
it
the
race
is
not
always
to
the
slowest
and
the
this
was
in
allusion
to
yesterday
the
skiffs
started
down
at
the
island
and
as
they
were
longer
coming
up
than
the
eight
oars
she
was
in
a
fever
for
nearly
ten
minutes
at
last
near
the
opposite
bank
up
came
the
two
leading
skiffs
struggling
both
men
visibly
exhausted
silcock
ahead
but
his
rudder
overlapped
by
hardie
bow
each
in
his
own
water
we
are
third
sighed
julia
and
turned
her
head
away
from
the
river
sorrowfully
but
only
for
a
moment
for
she
felt
dodd
start
and
press
her
arm
and
lo
edward
skiff
was
shooting
swiftly
across
from
their
side
of
the
river
he
was
pulling
just
within
himself
in
beautiful
form
and
with
far
more
elasticity
than
the
other
two
had
got
left
as
he
passed
his
mother
and
sister
his
eyes
seemed
to
strike
fire
and
he
laid
out
all
his
powers
and
went
at
the
leading
skiffs
hand
over
head
there
was
a
yell
of
astonishment
and
delight
from
both
sides
of
the
thames
he
passed
hardie
who
upon
that
relaxed
his
speed
in
thirty
seconds
more
he
was
even
with
silcock
then
came
a
keen
struggle
but
the
new
comer
was
the
horse
that
could
stay
he
drew
steadily
ahead
and
the
stern
of
his
boat
was
in
a
line
with
person
when
the
gun
fired
and
a
fearful
roar
from
the
bridge
the
river
and
the
banks
announced
that
the
favourite
university
had
picked
up
the
sculls
in
the
person
of
dodd
of
exeter
in
due
course
he
brought
the
little
silver
sculls
and
pinned
them
on
his
mother
while
she
and
julia
were
telling
him
how
proud
they
were
and
how
happy
they
should
be
but
for
their
fears
that
he
would
hurt
himself
beating
gentlemen
ever
so
much
older
than
himself
came
two
exeter
men
with
wild
looks
hunting
for
him
oh
dodd
hardie
wants
you
do
you
go
edward
whispered
julia
why
should
you
be
at
hardie
beck
and
call
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
that
youth
make
me
hate
oh
i
think
i
had
better
just
go
and
see
what
it
is
about
replied
edward
i
shall
be
back
and
on
this
understanding
he
went
off
with
the
men
passed
an
hour
two
hours
and
he
did
not
return
dodd
and
julia
sat
wondering
what
had
become
of
him
and
were
looking
all
around
and
getting
uneasy
when
at
last
they
did
hear
something
about
him
but
indirectly
and
from
an
unexpected
quarter
a
tall
young
man
in
a
jersey
and
flannel
trousers
and
a
little
straw
hat
with
a
purple
rosette
came
away
from
the
bustle
to
the
more
secluded
part
where
they
sat
and
made
eagerly
for
the
thames
as
if
he
was
a
duck
and
going
in
but
at
the
brink
he
flung
himself
into
a
sitting
posture
and
dipped
his
white
handkerchief
into
the
stream
then
tied
it
viciously
round
his
brow
doubled
himself
up
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
rocked
himself
like
an
old
woman
minus
the
patience
of
course
dodd
and
julia
sitting
but
a
few
paces
behind
him
interchanged
a
look
of
intelligence
the
young
gentleman
was
a
stranger
but
they
had
recognised
a
faithful
old
acquaintance
at
the
bottom
of
his
pantomime
they
discovered
too
that
the
afflicted
one
was
a
personage
for
he
had
not
sat
there
long
when
quite
a
little
band
of
men
came
after
him
observing
his
and
general
condition
they
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
one
of
them
remonstrated
eagerly
for
heaven
sake
come
back
to
the
boat
there
is
a
crowd
of
all
the
colleges
come
round
us
and
they
all
say
oxford
is
being
sold
we
had
a
chance
for
the
race
and
you
are
throwing
it
what
do
i
care
what
they
all
say
was
the
answer
delivered
with
a
kind
of
plaintive
snarl
but
we
care
then
i
pity
and
he
turned
his
back
fiercely
on
them
and
then
groaned
by
way
of
half
apology
another
tried
him
come
give
us
a
civil
answer
people
that
intrude
upon
a
man
privacy
racked
with
pain
have
no
right
to
demand
civility
replied
the
sufferer
more
gently
but
sullenly
enough
do
you
call
this
privacy
it
was
a
minute
ago
do
you
think
i
left
the
boat
and
came
here
among
the
natives
for
company
and
noise
with
my
head
splitting
here
julia
gave
dodd
a
soft
pinch
to
which
dodd
replied
by
a
smile
and
so
they
settled
who
this
petulant
young
invalid
must
be
it
is
no
use
observed
one
voce
the
bloke
really
has
awful
headaches
like
a
girl
and
then
he
always
shuts
up
this
way
you
will
only
rile
him
and
get
the
rough
side
of
his
here
then
the
conference
drew
towards
a
close
but
a
wadham
man
who
was
one
of
the
ambassadors
interposed
stop
a
minute
said
he
mr
hardie
i
have
not
the
honour
to
be
acquainted
with
you
and
i
am
not
here
to
annoy
you
nor
to
be
affronted
by
you
but
the
university
has
a
stake
in
this
race
and
the
university
expostulates
through
us
through
me
if
you
who
have
i
the
honour
inquired
hardie
assuming
politeness
sudden
and
vast
badham
of
badham
o
wadham
hear
that
ye
tuneful
nine
well
badham
o
wadham
you
are
no
acquaintance
of
mine
so
you
may
possibly
not
be
a
fool
let
us
assume
by
way
of
hypothesis
that
you
are
a
man
of
sense
a
man
of
reason
as
well
as
of
rhyme
then
follow
my
logic
hardie
of
exeter
is
a
good
man
in
a
boat
when
he
has
not
got
a
headache
when
he
has
got
a
headache
hardie
of
exeter
is
not
worth
a
straw
in
a
boat
hardie
of
exeter
has
a
headache
now
ergo
the
university
would
put
the
said
hardie
into
a
race
headache
and
all
and
reduce
defeat
to
a
certainty
and
ergo
on
the
same
premises
i
not
being
an
egotist
nor
an
ass
have
taken
hardie
of
exeter
and
his
headache
out
of
the
boat
as
i
should
have
done
any
other
cripple
secondly
i
have
put
the
best
man
on
the
river
into
this
place
total
i
have
given
the
university
the
benefit
of
my
brains
and
the
university
not
having
brains
enough
to
see
what
it
gains
by
the
exchange
turns
again
and
rends
me
like
an
animal
frequently
mentioned
in
scripture
but
bene
never
once
with
and
the
afflicted
rhetorician
attempted
a
diabolical
grin
but
failed
signally
and
groaned
instead
is
this
your
answer
to
the
university
sir
at
this
query
delivered
in
a
somewhat
threatening
tone
the
invalid
sat
up
all
in
a
moment
like
a
poked
lion
oh
if
badham
o
wadham
thinks
to
crush
me
sua
et
totius
universitatis
badham
wadham
may
just
tell
the
whole
university
to
go
and
be
d
d
from
the
chancellor
down
to
the
junior
cook
at
skimmery
hall
with
my
brute
muttered
badham
of
wadham
serve
you
right
if
the
university
were
to
chuck
you
into
the
and
with
this
comment
they
left
him
to
his
ill
temper
one
remained
sat
quietly
down
a
little
way
off
struck
a
sweetly
aromatic
lucifer
and
blew
a
noisome
cloud
but
the
only
one
which
betokens
calm
as
for
hardie
he
held
his
aching
head
over
his
knees
absorbed
in
pain
and
quite
unconscious
that
sacred
pity
was
poisoning
the
air
beside
him
and
two
pair
of
dovelike
eyes
resting
on
him
with
womanly
concern
dodd
and
julia
had
heard
the
greatest
part
of
this
colloquy
they
had
terribly
quick
ears
and
nothing
better
to
do
with
them
just
then
indeed
their
interest
was
excited
julia
went
so
far
as
to
put
her
salts
into
dodd
hand
with
a
little
earnest
look
but
dodd
did
not
act
upon
the
hint
she
had
learned
who
the
young
man
was
had
his
very
name
been
strange
to
her
she
would
have
been
more
at
her
ease
with
him
moreover
his
rudeness
to
the
other
men
repelled
her
a
little
above
all
he
had
uttered
a
monosyllable
and
a
stinger
a
thorn
of
speech
not
in
her
vocabulary
nor
even
in
society
those
might
be
his
manners
even
when
not
aching
still
it
seems
a
feather
would
have
turned
the
scale
in
his
favour
for
she
whispered
i
have
a
great
mind
if
i
could
but
catch
his
while
feminine
pity
and
social
reserve
were
holding
the
balance
so
nicely
and
nonsensically
about
half
a
split
straw
one
of
the
racing
went
down
close
under
the
berkshire
bank
london
observed
hardie
adherent
what
are
you
there
old
fellow
murmured
hardie
in
a
faint
voice
now
that
is
like
a
friend
a
real
friend
to
sit
by
me
and
not
make
a
row
thank
you
thank
you
presently
the
cambridge
passed
it
was
speedily
followed
by
the
oxford
the
last
came
down
in
and
hardie
eyed
it
keenly
as
it
passed
there
he
cried
was
i
wrong
there
is
a
swing
for
you
there
is
a
stroke
i
did
not
know
what
a
treasure
i
had
got
sitting
behind
the
ladies
looked
and
lo
the
lauded
stroke
of
the
was
their
edward
sing
out
and
tell
him
it
is
not
like
the
sculls
we
must
fight
for
the
lead
at
starting
and
hold
it
with
his
eyelids
when
he
has
got
the
adherent
bawled
this
at
edward
and
edward
reply
came
ringing
back
in
a
clear
cheerful
voice
we
mean
to
try
all
we
what
is
the
odds
inquired
the
invalid
faintly
even
on
london
two
to
one
against
cambridge
three
to
one
against
take
all
my
tin
and
lay
it
on
sighed
the
sufferer
fork
it
out
then
hallo
eighteen
pounds
fancy
having
eighteen
pounds
at
the
end
of
term
i
get
the
odds
up
at
the
bridge
directly
a
lady
offering
you
her
hardie
rose
and
turned
round
and
sure
enough
there
were
two
ladies
seated
in
their
carriage
at
some
distance
one
of
whom
was
holding
him
out
three
pretty
little
things
enough
a
little
smile
a
little
blush
and
a
little
bottle
with
a
gold
cork
the
last
panegyric
on
edward
had
turned
the
scale
hardie
went
slowly
up
to
the
side
of
the
carriage
and
took
off
his
hat
to
them
with
a
air
now
that
he
was
so
near
his
face
showed
very
pale
the
more
so
that
his
neck
was
a
good
deal
tanned
his
eyelids
were
rather
swollen
and
his
young
eyes
troubled
and
almost
filmy
with
the
pain
the
ladies
saw
and
their
gentle
bosoms
were
touched
they
had
heard
of
him
as
a
victorious
young
apollo
trampling
on
all
difficulties
of
mind
and
body
and
they
saw
him
wan
and
worn
with
feminine
suffering
the
contrast
made
him
doubly
interesting
arrived
at
the
side
of
the
carriage
he
almost
started
at
beauty
it
was
and
so
were
her
two
lovely
earnest
eyes
beaming
soft
pity
on
him
with
an
eloquence
he
had
never
seen
in
human
eyes
before
for
julia
were
mirrors
of
herself
they
did
nothing
by
halves
he
looked
at
her
and
her
mother
and
blushed
and
stood
irresolute
awaiting
their
commands
this
sudden
contrast
to
his
petulance
with
his
own
sex
paved
the
way
you
have
a
sad
headache
sir
said
dodd
oblige
me
by
trying
my
he
thanked
her
in
a
low
voice
and
mamma
inquired
julia
ought
he
to
sit
in
the
sun
certainly
not
you
had
better
sit
there
sir
and
profit
by
our
shade
and
our
yes
mamma
but
you
know
the
real
place
where
he
ought
to
be
is
oh
pray
do
say
that
implored
the
patient
but
julia
continued
with
unabated
severity
and
that
is
where
he
would
go
this
minute
if
i
was
his
instead
of
his
junior
and
a
stranger
said
dodd
somewhat
coldly
dwelling
with
a
very
slight
monitory
emphasis
on
the
julia
said
nothing
but
drew
in
perceptibly
and
was
dead
silent
ever
after
oh
madam
said
hardie
eagerly
i
do
not
dispute
her
authority
nor
yours
you
have
a
right
to
send
me
where
you
please
after
your
kindness
in
noticing
my
infernal
head
and
doing
me
the
honour
to
speak
to
me
and
lending
me
this
but
if
i
go
to
bed
my
head
will
be
my
master
besides
i
shall
throw
away
what
little
chance
i
have
of
making
your
acquaintance
and
the
race
just
coming
off
we
will
not
usurp
authority
sir
said
dodd
quietly
but
we
know
what
a
severe
headache
is
and
should
be
glad
to
see
you
sit
still
in
the
shade
and
excite
yourself
as
little
as
yes
madam
said
the
youth
humbly
and
sat
down
like
a
lamb
he
glanced
now
and
then
at
the
island
and
now
and
then
peered
up
at
the
radiant
young
mute
beside
him
the
silence
continued
till
it
was
broken
by
a
fish
out
of
water
an
undergraduate
in
spectacles
came
mooning
along
all
out
of
his
element
it
was
kennet
who
used
to
rise
at
four
every
morning
to
his
plato
and
walk
up
shotover
hill
every
afternoon
wet
or
dry
to
cool
his
eyes
for
his
evening
work
with
what
view
he
deviated
to
henley
has
not
yet
been
ascertained
he
was
blind
as
a
bat
and
did
not
care
a
button
about
any
earthly
except
the
one
in
the
aeneid
even
if
he
could
have
seen
one
however
nearly
all
the
men
of
his
college
went
to
henley
and
perhaps
some
branch
hitherto
unexplored
of
animal
magnetism
drew
him
after
at
any
rate
there
was
his
body
and
his
mind
at
oxford
and
athens
and
other
venerable
but
irrelevant
cities
he
brightened
at
sight
of
his
doge
and
asked
him
warmly
if
he
had
heard
the
news
no
what
nothing
wrong
i
hope
why
two
of
our
men
are
ploughed
that
is
all
said
kennet
affecting
with
withering
irony
to
undervalue
his
intelligence
confound
it
kennet
how
you
frightened
me
i
was
afraid
there
was
some
screw
loose
with
the
at
this
very
instant
the
smoke
of
the
pistol
was
seen
to
puff
out
from
the
island
and
hardie
rose
to
his
feet
they
are
off
cried
he
to
the
ladies
and
after
first
putting
his
palms
together
with
a
hypocritical
look
of
apology
he
laid
one
hand
on
an
old
barge
that
was
drawn
up
ashore
and
sprang
like
a
mountain
goat
on
to
the
bow
lighting
on
the
very
gunwale
the
position
was
not
tenable
an
instant
but
he
extended
one
foot
very
nimbly
and
boldly
and
planted
it
on
the
other
gunwale
and
there
he
was
in
a
moment
headache
and
all
in
an
attitude
as
large
and
inspired
as
the
boldest
gesture
antiquity
has
committed
to
marble
he
had
even
the
advantage
in
stature
over
most
of
the
sculptured
forms
of
greece
but
a
double
at
his
eye
spoiled
the
lot
as
punch
says
i
am
not
to
repeat
the
particulars
of
a
distant
race
coming
nearer
and
nearer
the
main
features
are
always
the
same
only
this
time
it
was
more
exciting
to
our
fair
friends
on
account
of
edward
high
stake
in
it
and
then
their
grateful
though
refractory
patient
an
authority
in
their
eyes
indeed
all
but
a
stood
poised
in
air
and
in
excited
whispers
interpreted
each
distant
and
unintelligible
feature
down
to
them
cambridge
was
off
but
not
anybody
race
at
present
if
this
lasts
long
we
may
win
none
of
them
can
stay
like
come
the
favourite
is
not
so
very
cambridge
looks
i
would
change
with
either
so
now
in
forty
seconds
more
i
shall
be
able
to
pick
out
the
julia
went
up
this
ladder
of
thrills
to
a
high
state
of
excitement
and
indeed
they
were
all
so
tuned
to
racing
pitch
that
some
metal
nerve
or
other
seemed
to
jar
inside
all
three
when
the
piercing
grating
voice
of
kennet
broke
in
suddenly
with
how
do
you
construe
greek
text
the
wretch
had
burrowed
in
the
intellectual
ruins
of
greece
the
moment
the
pistol
went
off
and
college
chat
ceased
hardie
raised
his
and
his
first
impulse
was
to
brain
the
judicious
kennet
gazing
up
to
him
for
an
answer
with
spectacles
goggling
like
supernatural
eyes
of
dead
sophists
in
the
sun
how
do
you
construe
you
incongruous
dog
hold
your
tongue
and
mind
the
there
i
thought
so
where
your
three
to
one
now
the
cockneys
are
out
of
this
event
any
way
go
on
universities
and
order
their
suppers
but
which
is
first
sir
asked
julia
imploringly
oh
which
is
first
of
all
neither
never
mind
it
looks
well
london
is
pumped
and
if
cambridge
ca
lead
him
before
this
turn
in
the
river
the
race
will
be
ours
now
look
out
by
jove
we
are
the
leading
boats
came
on
oxford
pulling
a
long
lofty
sturdy
stroke
that
seemed
as
if
it
never
could
compete
with
the
quick
action
of
its
competitor
yet
it
was
undeniably
ahead
and
gaining
at
every
swing
young
hardie
writhed
on
his
perch
he
screeched
at
them
across
the
thames
well
pulled
stroke
well
pulled
all
splendidly
pulled
dodd
you
are
walking
away
from
them
altogether
hurrah
oxford
for
ever
hurrah
the
gun
went
off
over
the
heads
of
the
oxford
crew
in
advance
and
even
dodd
and
julia
could
see
the
race
was
theirs
we
have
won
at
last
cried
julia
all
on
fire
and
fairly
only
think
of
that
hardie
turned
round
grateful
to
beauty
for
siding
with
his
university
yes
and
the
fools
may
thank
me
or
rather
my
man
dodd
dodd
for
ever
hurrah
at
this
climax
even
dodd
took
a
gentle
share
in
the
youthful
enthusiasm
that
was
boiling
around
her
and
her
soft
eyes
sparkled
and
she
returned
the
fervid
pressure
of
her
daughter
hand
and
both
their
faces
were
flushed
with
gratified
pride
and
affection
dodd
broke
in
the
incongruous
dog
with
a
voice
just
like
a
saw
dodd
ah
that
the
man
who
is
just
ploughed
for
ice
has
its
thunderbolts
chapter
ii
winning
was
all
very
fine
but
a
hundred
such
victories
could
not
compensate
kennet
female
hearers
for
one
such
defeat
as
he
had
announced
a
defeat
that
to
their
minds
carried
disgrace
their
edward
plucked
at
first
they
were
benumbed
and
sat
chilled
with
red
cheeks
bewildered
between
present
triumph
and
mortification
at
hand
then
the
colour
ebbed
out
of
their
faces
and
they
encouraged
each
other
feebly
in
whispers
might
it
not
be
a
mistake
but
unconscious
kennet
robbed
them
of
this
timid
hope
he
was
now
in
his
element
knew
all
about
it
rushed
into
details
and
sawed
away
all
doubt
from
their
minds
the
sum
was
this
dodd
general
performance
was
mediocre
but
passable
he
was
plucked
for
his
logic
hardie
said
he
was
very
sorry
for
it
what
does
it
matter
answered
kennet
he
is
a
well
and
i
am
a
why
you
told
me
yourself
the
other
day
poor
dodd
was
anxious
about
it
on
account
of
his
friends
and
that
reminds
me
they
say
he
has
got
two
pretty
sisters
says
kennet
briskly
i
go
and
tell
him
i
know
him
just
to
speak
what
does
he
know
how
can
he
know
said
kennet
jealously
the
testamurs
were
only
just
out
as
i
came
and
within
this
he
started
on
his
congenial
errand
hardie
took
two
or
three
of
his
long
strides
and
fairly
collared
him
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
what
not
tell
a
man
when
he
ploughed
that
is
a
good
no
there
time
enough
tell
him
after
chapel
or
in
chapel
if
you
must
but
why
poison
his
triumphal
cup
and
his
sisters
too
why
spoil
their
pleasure
hang
it
all
not
a
word
about
to
any
living
soul
to
his
surprise
kennet
face
expressed
no
sympathy
nor
even
bare
assent
at
this
hardie
lost
patience
and
burst
out
impetuously
take
care
how
you
refuse
me
take
care
how
you
thwart
me
in
this
he
is
the
fellow
in
college
it
does
matter
to
you
and
it
does
to
him
and
if
you
then
take
my
name
off
the
list
of
your
acquaintance
for
i
never
speak
a
word
to
you
again
in
this
world
no
not
on
my
by
heaven
the
threat
was
extravagant
but
youth
glowing
cheek
and
eye
and
imperious
lip
and
simple
generosity
made
it
almost
beautiful
kennet
whined
oh
if
you
talk
like
that
there
is
an
end
to
fair
end
it
then
and
promise
me
upon
your
honour
why
not
what
bosh
there
i
promise
now
how
do
you
construe
greek
text
the
incongruous
dog
i
thank
thee
taff
for
teaching
me
that
word
put
this
query
with
the
severity
of
an
inquisitor
bringing
back
a
garrulous
prisoner
to
the
point
hardie
replied
gaily
any
way
you
like
now
you
are
a
good
fellow
come
that
is
evasive
my
tutor
says
it
can
not
be
rendered
by
any
one
english
word
no
more
can
greek
text
why
what
on
earth
can
he
know
about
english
greek
text
is
a
cormorant
greek
text
is
a
skinflint
and
your
tutor
is
a
duffer
hush
keep
dark
now
here
he
and
he
went
hastily
to
meet
edward
dodd
and
by
that
means
intercepted
him
on
his
way
to
the
carriage
give
me
your
hand
dodd
he
cried
you
have
saved
the
university
you
must
be
stroke
of
the
after
me
let
me
see
more
of
you
than
i
have
old
within
all
my
heart
replied
edward
calmly
but
taking
the
offered
hand
cordially
though
he
rather
wanted
to
get
away
to
his
mother
and
sister
we
will
pull
together
and
read
together
into
the
bargain
continued
hardie
read
together
you
and
i
what
do
you
mean
well
you
see
i
am
pretty
well
up
in
the
imigliner
books
what
i
have
got
to
rub
up
is
my
divinity
and
my
logic
especially
my
logic
will
you
grind
logic
with
me
say
for
i
know
you
will
keep
your
it
is
too
good
an
offer
to
refuse
hardie
but
now
i
look
at
you
you
are
excited
wonderfully
excited
within
the
race
eh
now
just
you
wait
quietly
till
next
week
and
then
if
you
are
so
soft
as
to
ask
me
in
cool
blood
wait
a
week
cried
the
impetuous
youth
no
not
a
minute
it
is
settled
there
we
cram
logic
together
next
and
he
shook
edward
hand
again
with
glistening
eyes
and
an
emotion
that
was
quite
unintelligible
to
edward
but
not
to
the
quick
sensitive
spirits
who
sat
but
fifteen
yards
off
you
really
must
excuse
me
just
now
said
edward
and
ran
to
the
carriage
and
put
out
both
hands
to
the
fair
occupants
they
kissed
him
eagerly
with
little
tender
sighs
and
it
cost
them
no
slight
effort
not
to
cry
publicly
over
the
beloved
the
victorious
the
young
hardie
stood
petrified
what
these
ladies
dodd
sisters
why
one
of
them
had
called
the
other
mamma
good
heavens
all
his
talk
in
their
hearing
had
been
of
dodd
and
kennet
and
he
between
them
had
let
out
the
very
thing
he
wanted
to
conceal
especially
from
relations
he
gazed
at
them
and
turned
hot
to
the
very
forehead
then
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
say
and
being
after
all
but
a
clever
boy
not
a
cool
never
unready
man
of
the
world
he
slipped
away
blushing
kennet
followed
goggling
left
to
herself
dodd
would
have
broken
the
bad
news
to
edward
at
once
and
taken
the
line
of
consoling
him
under
her
own
vexation
it
would
not
have
been
the
first
time
that
she
had
played
that
card
but
young
hardie
had
said
it
would
be
unkind
to
poison
edward
day
and
it
is
sweet
woman
nature
to
follow
suit
so
she
and
julia
put
bright
faces
on
and
edward
passed
a
right
jocund
afternoon
with
them
he
was
not
allowed
to
surprise
one
of
the
looks
they
interchanged
to
relieve
their
secret
mortification
but
after
dinner
as
the
time
drew
near
for
him
to
go
back
to
oxford
dodd
became
silent
and
a
little
and
at
last
drew
her
chair
away
to
a
small
table
and
wrote
a
letter
in
directing
it
she
turned
it
purposely
so
that
julia
could
catch
the
address
edward
dodd
exeter
college
julia
was
naturally
startled
at
first
and
her
eye
roved
almost
comically
to
and
fro
the
letter
and
its
destination
seated
calm
and
unconscious
of
woman
beneficent
wiles
but
her
heart
soon
divined
the
mystery
it
was
to
reach
him
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
spare
him
the
pain
of
writing
the
news
to
them
and
doubtless
so
worded
as
not
to
leave
him
a
day
in
doubt
of
their
forgiveness
and
sympathy
julia
took
the
missive
unobserved
by
the
destination
and
glided
out
of
the
room
to
get
it
quietly
posted
the
was
waiting
on
the
lodgers
and
told
her
so
with
a
significant
addition
that
the
post
was
in
this
street
and
only
a
few
doors
off
julia
was
a
little
surprised
at
her
coolness
but
took
the
hint
with
perfect
good
temper
and
just
put
on
her
shawl
and
bonnet
and
went
with
it
herself
the
was
not
quite
so
near
as
represented
but
she
was
soon
there
for
she
was
eager
till
she
had
posted
it
but
she
came
back
slowly
and
thoughtfully
here
in
the
street
lighted
only
by
the
moon
and
an
occasional
gaslight
there
was
no
need
for
and
soon
her
mortification
betrayed
itself
in
her
speaking
countenance
and
to
think
that
her
mother
on
whom
she
doted
should
have
to
write
to
her
son
there
present
and
post
the
letter
this
made
her
eyes
fill
and
before
she
reached
the
door
of
the
lodging
they
were
brimming
over
as
she
put
her
foot
on
the
step
a
timid
voice
addressed
her
in
a
low
tone
of
supplication
may
i
venture
to
speak
one
word
to
you
miss
dodd
one
single
word
she
looked
up
surprised
and
it
was
young
hardie
his
tall
figure
was
bending
towards
her
submissively
and
his
face
as
well
as
his
utterance
betrayed
considerable
agitation
and
what
led
to
so
unusual
a
rencontre
between
a
young
gentleman
and
lady
who
had
never
been
introduced
the
tender
passion
says
a
reader
of
many
novels
why
yes
the
tenderest
in
all
our
nature
wounded
vanity
naturally
proud
and
sensitive
and
inflated
by
success
and
flattery
alfred
hardie
had
been
torturing
himself
ever
since
he
fled
female
relations
he
was
mortified
to
the
core
he
confounded
the
fools
his
favourite
synonym
for
his
acquaintance
for
going
and
calling
dodd
mother
an
elder
sister
and
so
not
giving
him
a
chance
to
divine
her
and
then
that
he
who
prided
himself
on
his
discrimination
should
take
them
for
ladies
of
rank
or
at
all
events
of
the
highest
fashion
and
climax
of
humiliation
that
so
great
a
man
as
he
should
go
and
seem
to
court
them
by
praising
dodd
of
exeter
by
enlarging
upon
dodd
of
exeter
by
offering
to
grind
logic
with
dodd
of
exeter
who
would
believe
that
this
was
a
coincidence
a
mere
coincidence
they
could
not
be
expected
to
believe
it
female
vanity
would
not
let
them
he
tingled
and
was
not
far
from
hating
the
whole
family
so
bitter
a
thing
is
that
which
i
have
ventured
to
dub
the
tenderest
he
itched
to
soothe
his
irritation
by
explaining
to
edward
dodd
was
a
frank
fellow
he
would
listen
to
facts
and
convince
the
ladies
in
turn
hardie
learned
where
dodd
party
lodged
and
waited
about
the
door
to
catch
him
alone
dodd
must
be
in
college
by
twelve
and
would
leave
henley
before
ten
he
waited
till
he
was
tired
of
waiting
but
at
last
the
door
opened
he
stepped
forward
and
out
tripped
miss
dodd
confound
it
muttered
hardie
and
drew
back
however
he
stood
and
admired
her
graceful
figure
and
action
her
ladylike
speed
without
bustling
had
she
come
back
at
the
same
pace
he
would
never
have
ventured
to
stop
her
on
such
a
thread
do
things
hang
but
she
returned
very
slowly
hanging
her
head
her
look
at
him
and
his
headache
recurred
to
him
a
look
brimful
of
goodness
she
would
do
as
well
as
edward
better
perhaps
he
yielded
to
impulse
and
addressed
her
but
with
all
the
trepidation
of
a
youth
defying
the
giant
etiquette
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
julia
was
a
little
surprised
and
fluttered
but
did
not
betray
it
she
had
been
taught
by
example
if
not
by
precept
certainly
hardie
said
she
within
a
modest
composure
a
young
coquette
might
have
envied
under
the
circumstances
hardie
had
now
only
to
explain
himself
but
instead
of
that
he
stood
looking
at
her
within
silent
concern
the
fair
face
she
raised
to
him
was
wet
with
tears
so
were
her
eyes
and
even
the
glorious
eyelashes
were
fringed
with
that
tender
spray
and
it
glistened
in
the
moonlight
this
sad
and
pretty
sight
drove
the
vain
but
generous
youth
calamity
clean
out
of
his
head
why
you
are
crying
miss
dodd
what
is
the
matter
i
hope
nothing
has
julia
turned
her
head
away
a
little
fretfully
with
a
no
no
but
soon
her
natural
candour
and
simplicity
prevailed
a
simplicity
not
without
dignity
she
turned
round
to
him
and
looked
him
in
the
face
why
should
i
deny
it
to
you
sir
who
have
been
good
enough
to
sympathise
with
us
we
are
mortified
sadly
mortified
at
dear
edward
disgrace
and
it
has
cost
us
a
struggle
not
to
disobey
you
and
his
triumphal
with
sad
looks
and
mamma
had
to
write
to
him
and
console
him
against
but
i
hope
he
will
not
feel
it
so
severely
as
she
does
and
i
have
just
posted
it
myself
and
when
i
thought
of
our
dear
mamma
being
driven
to
such
expedients
i
oh
and
the
pure
young
heart
having
opened
itself
by
words
must
flow
a
little
more
oh
pray
do
cry
said
young
hardie
tenderly
do
take
such
a
trifle
to
heart
so
you
crying
makes
me
feel
guilty
for
letting
it
happen
it
shall
never
occur
again
if
i
had
only
known
it
should
never
have
happened
at
once
is
enough
sighed
julia
indeed
you
take
it
too
much
to
heart
it
is
only
out
of
oxford
a
plough
is
thought
much
of
especially
a
single
one
that
is
so
very
common
you
see
miss
dodd
an
university
examination
consists
of
several
items
neglect
but
one
and
crichton
himself
would
be
ploughed
because
brilliancy
in
your
other
papers
is
not
allowed
to
count
that
is
how
the
most
distinguished
man
of
our
day
got
ploughed
for
smalls
i
had
a
narrow
escape
i
know
for
one
but
miss
dodd
if
you
knew
how
far
your
brother
performance
on
the
river
outweighs
a
mere
slip
in
the
schools
in
all
university
men
eyes
the
dons
and
all
you
would
not
make
this
bright
day
end
sadly
to
oxford
by
crying
why
i
could
find
you
a
thousand
men
who
would
be
ploughed
with
glory
and
delight
to
win
one
such
race
as
your
brother
has
won
julia
sighed
again
but
it
sounded
now
half
like
a
sigh
of
relief
the
final
sigh
with
which
the
fair
consent
to
be
consoled
and
indeed
this
improvement
in
the
music
did
not
escape
hardie
he
felt
he
was
on
the
right
tack
he
enumerated
fluently
and
by
name
many
good
men
besides
dean
swift
who
had
been
ploughed
yet
had
cultivated
the
field
of
letters
in
their
turn
and
in
short
he
was
so
earnest
and
plausible
that
something
like
a
smile
hovered
about
his
hearer
lips
and
she
glanced
askant
at
him
with
furtive
gratitude
from
under
her
silky
lashes
but
it
soon
recurred
to
her
that
this
was
rather
a
long
interview
to
accord
to
a
stranger
and
under
the
moon
so
she
said
a
little
stiffly
and
was
this
what
you
were
good
enough
to
wish
to
say
to
me
hardie
no
miss
dodd
to
be
frank
it
was
not
my
motive
in
addressing
you
without
the
right
to
take
such
a
freedom
was
egotistical
i
came
here
to
clear
myself
i
i
was
afraid
you
must
think
me
a
humbug
you
i
do
not
understand
you
well
i
feared
you
and
dodd
might
think
i
praised
dodd
so
and
did
what
little
i
did
for
him
knowing
who
you
were
and
wishing
to
curry
favour
with
you
by
all
that
and
that
is
so
underhand
and
paltry
a
way
of
going
to
work
i
should
despise
oh
hardie
said
the
young
lady
smiling
how
foolish
why
of
course
we
knew
you
had
no
indeed
i
had
not
but
how
could
you
know
it
why
we
saw
it
do
you
think
we
have
no
eyes
ah
and
much
keener
ones
than
gentlemen
have
it
is
mamma
and
i
who
are
to
blame
if
anybody
we
ought
to
have
declared
ourselves
it
would
have
been
more
generous
more
manly
but
we
can
not
all
be
gentlemen
you
know
it
was
so
sweet
to
hear
edward
praised
by
one
who
did
not
know
us
it
was
like
stolen
fruit
and
by
one
whom
others
praise
so
if
you
can
forgive
us
our
slyness
there
is
an
end
of
the
forgive
you
you
have
taken
a
thorn
out
of
my
then
i
am
so
glad
you
summoned
courage
to
speak
to
me
without
ceremony
mamma
would
have
done
better
though
but
after
all
do
not
i
know
her
my
mamma
is
all
goodness
and
intelligence
and
be
assured
sir
she
does
you
justice
and
is
quite
sensible
of
your
kindness
to
dear
with
this
she
was
about
to
retire
ah
but
you
miss
dodd
with
whom
i
have
taken
this
unwarrantable
liberty
said
hardie
imploringly
me
hardie
you
do
me
the
honour
to
require
my
opinion
of
your
performances
including
of
course
this
hardie
hung
his
head
there
was
a
touch
of
satire
in
the
lady
voice
he
thought
her
soft
eyes
rested
demurely
on
him
a
moment
she
saw
he
was
a
little
abashed
my
opinion
of
it
all
is
that
you
have
been
very
kind
to
us
in
being
most
kind
to
our
poor
edward
i
never
saw
nor
read
of
anything
more
generous
more
manly
and
then
thoughtful
considerate
delicate
so
instead
of
criticising
you
as
you
seem
to
expect
his
sister
only
blesses
you
and
thanks
you
from
the
very
bottom
of
her
she
had
begun
within
a
polite
composure
borrowed
from
mamma
but
once
launched
her
ardent
nature
got
the
better
her
colour
rose
and
rose
and
her
voice
sank
and
sank
and
the
last
words
came
almost
in
a
whisper
and
such
a
lovely
whisper
a
gurgle
from
the
heart
and
as
she
concluded
her
delicate
hand
came
sweeping
out
with
a
gesture
of
large
and
sovereign
cordiality
that
made
even
the
honest
words
and
the
divine
tones
more
eloquent
it
was
too
much
the
young
man
ardent
as
herself
and
not
in
reality
half
so
timorous
caught
fire
and
seeing
a
white
eloquent
hand
rather
near
him
caught
it
and
pressed
his
warm
lips
on
it
in
mute
adoration
and
gratitude
at
this
she
was
scared
and
offended
oh
keep
that
for
the
queen
cried
she
turning
scarlet
and
tossing
her
fair
head
into
the
air
like
a
startled
stag
and
she
drew
her
hand
away
quickly
and
decidedly
though
not
roughly
he
stammered
a
lowly
apology
in
the
very
middle
of
it
she
said
quietly
hardie
and
swept
with
a
gracious
little
curtsey
through
the
doorway
leaving
him
and
so
the
virginal
instinct
of
carried
her
off
swiftly
and
cleverly
but
none
too
soon
for
on
entering
the
house
that
external
composure
her
two
mothers
mesdames
dodd
and
nature
had
taught
her
fell
from
her
like
a
veil
and
she
fluttered
up
the
stairs
to
her
own
room
with
hot
cheeks
and
panted
there
like
some
wild
thing
that
has
been
grasped
at
and
grazed
she
felt
young
hardie
lips
upon
the
palm
of
her
hand
plainly
they
seemed
to
linger
there
still
it
was
like
light
but
live
velvet
this
and
the
ardent
look
he
had
poured
into
her
eyes
set
the
young
creature
quivering
nobody
had
looked
at
her
so
before
and
no
young
gentleman
had
imprinted
living
velvet
on
her
hand
she
was
alarmed
ashamed
and
uneasy
what
right
had
he
to
look
at
her
like
that
what
shadow
of
a
right
to
go
and
kiss
her
hand
he
could
not
pretend
to
think
she
had
put
it
out
to
be
kissed
ladies
put
forth
the
back
of
the
hand
for
that
not
the
palm
the
truth
was
he
was
an
impudent
fellow
and
she
hated
him
now
and
herself
too
for
being
so
simple
as
to
let
him
talk
to
her
mamma
would
not
have
been
so
imprudent
when
she
was
a
girl
she
would
not
go
down
for
she
felt
there
must
be
something
of
this
kind
legibly
branded
on
her
face
oh
oh
just
look
at
this
young
lady
she
has
been
letting
a
young
gentleman
kiss
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
the
feel
has
not
gone
off
yet
you
may
see
that
by
her
but
then
poor
edward
she
must
go
down
so
she
put
a
wet
towel
to
her
cheeks
and
dried
them
by
artistic
dabs
avoiding
friction
and
came
downstairs
like
a
mouse
and
turned
the
noiselessly
and
glided
into
the
looking
so
transparent
conscious
and
all
on
fire
with
beauty
and
animation
that
even
edward
was
startled
and
in
a
whisper
bade
his
mother
observe
what
a
pretty
girl
she
was
beats
all
the
country
girls
in
a
dodd
did
look
and
consequently
as
soon
as
ever
edward
was
gone
to
oxford
she
said
to
julia
you
are
feverish
love
you
have
been
excited
with
all
this
you
had
better
go
to
julia
complied
willingly
for
she
wanted
to
be
alone
and
think
she
retired
to
her
own
room
and
went
the
whole
day
over
again
and
was
happy
and
sorry
exalted
and
uneasy
by
turns
and
ended
by
excusing
hardie
escapade
and
throwing
the
blame
on
herself
she
ought
to
have
been
more
distant
gentlemen
were
not
expected
nor
indeed
much
wanted
to
be
modest
a
little
assurance
did
not
misbecome
them
really
i
think
it
sets
them
off
said
she
to
herself
grand
total
what
he
think
of
me
time
gallops
in
reverie
the
town
clock
struck
twelve
and
with
its
iron
tongue
remorse
entered
her
youthful
conscience
was
this
obeying
mamma
mamma
had
said
go
to
bed
not
go
upstairs
and
meditate
upon
young
she
gave
an
expressive
shake
of
her
fair
shoulders
like
a
swan
flapping
the
water
off
its
downy
wings
and
so
dismissed
the
subject
from
her
mind
then
she
said
her
prayers
then
she
rose
from
her
knees
and
in
tones
of
honey
said
puss
puss
pretty
puss
and
awaited
a
result
thieves
and
ghosts
she
did
not
believe
in
yet
credited
cats
under
beds
and
thought
them
neither
harmless
nor
necessary
there
after
tenderly
evoking
the
dreaded
and
chimerical
quadruped
she
proceeded
none
the
less
to
careful
research
especially
of
cupboards
the
door
of
one
resisted
and
then
yielded
with
a
crack
and
blew
out
the
candle
there
now
said
she
it
was
her
only
light
except
her
beauty
they
allotted
each
hebe
but
one
candle
in
that
ancient
burgh
well
she
thought
there
is
moonlight
enough
to
she
went
to
draw
back
one
of
the
curtains
but
in
the
act
she
started
back
with
a
little
scream
there
was
a
tall
figure
over
the
way
watching
the
house
the
moon
shone
from
her
side
of
the
street
full
on
him
and
in
that
instant
her
quick
eye
recognised
hardie
well
said
she
aloud
and
with
an
indescribable
inflexion
and
hid
herself
swiftly
in
impenetrable
gloom
but
after
a
while
eve
daughter
must
have
a
peep
she
stole
with
infinite
caution
to
one
side
of
the
curtain
and
made
an
aperture
just
big
enough
for
one
bright
eye
yes
there
he
was
motionless
i
tell
mamma
said
she
to
him
malignantly
as
if
the
sound
could
reach
him
unconscious
of
the
direful
threat
he
did
not
budge
she
was
unaffectedly
puzzled
at
this
phenomenon
and
not
being
the
least
vain
fell
to
wondering
whether
he
played
the
nightly
sentinel
opposite
every
lady
window
who
exchanged
civilities
within
him
because
if
he
does
he
is
a
fool
said
she
promptly
but
on
reflection
she
felt
sure
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
habitually
for
he
had
too
high
an
opinion
of
himself
she
had
noted
that
trait
in
him
at
a
very
early
stage
she
satisfied
herself
by
cautious
examination
that
he
did
not
know
her
room
he
was
making
a
temple
of
the
whole
lodging
how
ridiculous
of
him
yet
he
appeared
to
be
happy
over
it
there
was
an
exalted
look
in
his
moonlit
face
she
seemed
now
first
to
see
his
soul
there
she
studied
his
countenance
like
an
inscription
and
deciphered
each
rapt
expression
that
crossed
it
and
stored
them
in
her
memory
twice
she
left
her
ambuscade
to
go
to
bed
and
twice
curiosity
or
something
drew
her
back
at
last
having
looked
peered
and
peeped
till
her
feet
were
cold
and
her
face
the
reverse
she
informed
herself
that
the
foolish
thing
had
tired
her
out
policeman
said
she
pretending
to
bawl
to
him
and
oh
do
rain
as
hard
as
ever
you
with
this
benevolent
aspiration
a
little
too
violent
to
be
sincere
she
laid
her
cheek
on
her
pillow
doughtily
but
her
sentinel
when
out
of
sight
had
more
power
to
disturb
her
she
lay
and
wondered
whether
he
was
still
there
and
what
it
all
meant
and
whatever
mamma
would
say
and
which
of
the
two
she
or
he
was
the
head
culprit
in
this
strange
performance
to
which
earth
she
conceived
had
seen
no
parallel
and
above
all
what
he
would
do
next
her
pulse
galloped
and
her
sleep
was
broken
and
she
came
down
in
the
morning
a
little
pale
dodd
saw
it
at
once
with
the
quick
maternal
eye
and
moralised
it
is
curious
youth
is
so
fond
of
pleasure
yet
pleasure
seldom
agrees
with
youth
this
little
excitement
has
done
your
mother
good
who
is
no
longer
young
but
it
has
been
too
much
for
you
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
back
to
our
quiet
ah
will
that
home
be
as
tranquil
now
chapter
iii
the
long
vacation
commenced
about
a
month
afterwards
and
hardie
came
to
his
father
house
to
read
for
honours
unimpeded
by
university
races
and
college
lectures
and
the
ploughed
and
penitent
one
packed
up
his
aldrich
and
his
whately
the
then
authorities
in
logic
and
brought
them
home
together
with
a
firm
resolution
to
master
that
joyous
science
before
the
next
examination
for
smalls
in
october
but
lo
ere
he
had
been
an
hour
at
home
he
found
his
things
put
neatly
away
in
his
drawers
on
the
feminine
or
vertical
system
deep
strata
of
waistcoats
strata
of
trousers
strata
of
coats
strata
of
papers
and
his
logic
gone
in
the
course
of
the
evening
he
taxed
his
sister
and
asked
what
earthly
use
that
book
was
to
her
not
wearing
i
intend
to
read
it
and
study
it
and
teach
you
it
replied
julia
rather
languidly
considering
the
weight
of
the
resolve
oh
if
you
have
boned
it
to
read
i
say
no
more
the
crime
will
punish
be
serious
edward
and
think
of
mamma
i
can
not
sit
with
my
hands
before
me
and
let
you
be
i
do
want
but
reploughed
haw
haw
but
you
ca
help
me
at
logic
as
you
used
at
syntax
why
all
the
world
knows
a
girl
learn
a
girl
can
learn
anything
she
chooses
to
learn
what
she
ca
learn
is
things
other
people
set
her
down
before
edward
could
fully
digest
this
revelation
she
gave
the
argument
a
new
turn
by
adding
fretfully
and
do
be
so
unkind
thwarting
and
teasing
me
and
all
in
a
moment
she
was
crying
halloa
ejaculated
edward
taken
quite
by
surprise
what
is
the
matter
dears
inquired
maternal
vigilance
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
you
did
not
speak
brusquely
to
her
edward
no
no
said
julia
eagerly
it
is
i
that
am
turned
so
cross
and
so
peevish
i
am
quite
a
changed
girl
mamma
what
the
matter
with
me
and
she
laid
her
brow
on
her
mother
bosom
dodd
caressed
the
lovely
head
soothingly
with
one
hand
and
made
a
sign
over
it
to
edward
to
leave
them
alone
she
waited
quietly
till
julia
was
composed
and
then
said
softly
come
tell
me
what
it
is
nothing
that
edward
said
to
you
for
i
heard
almost
every
word
and
i
was
just
going
to
smile
or
nearly
when
you
and
my
love
it
is
not
the
first
time
you
know
i
would
not
tell
edward
but
i
have
more
than
once
seen
your
eyes
with
tears
in
have
you
mamma
said
julia
scarcely
above
a
whisper
why
you
know
i
have
but
i
said
to
myself
it
was
no
use
forcing
confidence
i
thought
i
would
be
very
patient
and
wait
till
you
came
to
me
with
it
so
now
what
is
it
my
darling
why
do
you
speak
of
one
thing
and
think
of
another
and
cry
without
any
reason
that
your
mother
can
see
i
do
know
mamma
said
julia
hiding
her
head
i
think
it
is
because
i
sleep
so
badly
i
rise
in
the
morning
hot
and
quivering
and
more
tired
than
i
lay
dodd
inquired
how
long
this
had
been
julia
did
not
answer
this
question
she
went
on
with
her
face
still
hidden
mamma
i
do
feel
so
depressed
and
hysterical
or
else
in
violent
spirits
but
not
nice
and
cheerful
as
you
are
and
i
used
to
be
and
i
go
from
one
thing
to
another
and
can
settle
to
nothing
even
in
church
i
attend
by
fits
and
starts
i
forgot
to
water
my
very
flowers
last
night
and
i
heard
maxley
out
of
my
window
tell
sarah
i
am
losing
my
colour
am
i
but
what
does
it
matter
i
am
losing
my
sense
for
i
catch
myself
for
ever
looking
in
the
glass
and
that
is
a
sure
sign
of
a
fool
you
know
and
i
can
not
pass
the
shops
i
stand
and
look
in
and
long
for
the
very
dearest
silks
and
for
diamonds
in
my
a
deep
sigh
followed
the
confession
of
these
multiform
imperfections
and
the
culprit
half
raised
her
head
to
watch
their
effect
as
for
dodd
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
with
surprise
but
at
the
end
of
the
heterogeneous
catalogue
she
smiled
and
said
i
can
not
believe
if
ever
there
was
a
young
lady
free
from
personal
vanity
it
is
my
julia
why
your
thoughts
run
by
nature
away
from
yourself
you
were
born
for
her
daughter
kissed
her
gratefully
and
smiled
but
after
a
pause
said
sorrowfully
ah
that
was
the
old
julia
as
seen
with
your
dear
eyes
i
have
almost
forgotten
the
new
one
is
what
i
tell
you
dear
mamma
and
that
within
sudden
fervour
is
a
dreamy
wandering
vain
egotistical
hysterical
abominable
let
me
kiss
this
monster
that
i
have
brought
into
the
world
said
dodd
and
now
let
me
she
rested
her
eyes
calm
and
penetrating
upon
her
daughter
and
at
this
mere
look
but
a
very
searching
one
the
colour
mounted
and
mounted
in
julia
cheek
strangely
after
all
said
dodd
thoughtfully
yours
is
a
critical
age
perhaps
my
child
is
turning
to
a
woman
my
rosebud
to
a
rose
and
she
sighed
mothers
will
sigh
at
things
none
other
ever
sighed
at
to
a
weed
i
fear
replied
julia
what
will
you
say
when
i
own
i
felt
no
real
joy
at
edward
return
this
time
and
yesterday
i
cried
get
away
and
do
pester
me
to
your
brother
oh
oh
no
mamma
that
was
to
poor
spot
he
jumped
on
me
in
a
reverie
all
affection
poor
well
for
your
comfort
dogs
do
not
appreciate
the
niceties
of
our
i
am
afraid
they
do
when
we
kick
dodd
smiled
at
the
admission
implied
here
and
the
deep
penitence
it
was
uttered
with
but
julia
remonstrated
oh
no
no
do
laugh
at
me
but
help
me
within
your
advice
you
are
so
wise
and
so
experienced
you
must
have
been
a
girl
before
you
were
an
angel
you
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
oh
do
pray
cure
me
or
else
kill
me
for
i
can
not
go
on
like
this
all
my
affections
deadened
and
my
peace
and
now
the
mother
looked
serious
and
thoughtful
enough
and
the
daughter
watched
her
furtively
julia
said
dodd
very
gravely
if
it
was
not
my
child
reared
under
my
eye
and
never
separated
from
me
a
single
day
i
should
say
this
young
lady
is
either
afflicted
with
some
complaint
and
it
affects
her
nerves
and
spirits
or
else
she
has
she
is
what
inexperienced
young
people
call
love
you
need
not
look
so
frightened
child
nobody
in
their
senses
suspects
of
imprudence
or
indelicacy
and
therefore
i
feel
quite
sure
that
your
constitution
is
at
a
crisis
or
your
health
has
suffered
some
shock
pray
heaven
it
may
not
be
a
serious
one
you
will
have
the
best
advice
and
without
delay
i
promise
chapter
iv
that
very
evening
dodd
sent
a
servant
into
the
town
with
a
note
like
a
for
osmond
a
consulting
surgeon
who
bore
a
high
reputation
in
barkington
he
came
and
proved
too
plump
for
that
complete
elegance
she
would
have
desired
in
a
medical
attendant
but
had
a
soft
hand
a
gentle
touch
and
a
subdued
manner
he
spoke
to
the
patient
with
a
kindness
which
won
the
mother
directly
had
every
hope
of
setting
her
right
without
any
violent
or
disagreeable
remedies
but
when
she
had
retired
altered
his
tone
and
told
dodd
seriously
she
had
done
well
to
send
for
him
in
time
it
was
a
case
of
hyperaesthesia
dodd
clasped
her
hands
in
alarm
or
as
unprofessional
persons
would
say
sensibility
dodd
was
somewhat
relieved
translation
blunts
thunderbolts
she
told
him
she
had
always
feared
for
her
child
on
that
score
but
was
sensibility
curable
could
a
nature
be
changed
he
replied
that
the
idiosyncrasy
could
not
but
its
morbid
excess
could
especially
when
taken
in
time
advice
was
generally
called
in
too
late
however
here
the
only
serious
symptom
was
the
insomnia
we
must
treat
her
for
that
said
he
writing
a
prescription
but
for
the
rest
active
employment
long
walks
or
rides
and
a
change
of
scene
and
associations
will
be
all
that
will
be
required
in
these
cases
resumed
osmond
connected
as
they
are
with
hyperaemia
some
medical
men
considered
moderate
venesection
to
be
he
then
put
on
his
gloves
saying
the
diet
of
course
must
be
antiphlogistic
let
us
say
then
for
breakfast
dry
toast
with
very
little
butter
no
coffee
cocoa
from
the
nibs
or
weak
tea
for
luncheon
or
for
dinner
a
slice
of
roast
chicken
and
tapioca
or
semolina
pudding
i
would
give
her
one
glass
of
sherry
but
no
more
and
it
would
be
as
well
to
avoid
brown
meats
at
all
events
for
the
present
with
these
precautions
my
dear
madam
i
think
your
anxiety
will
soon
be
happily
julia
took
her
long
walks
and
light
diet
and
became
a
little
pale
at
times
and
had
fewer
bursts
of
high
spirits
in
the
intervals
of
depression
her
mother
went
with
her
case
to
a
female
friend
the
lady
said
she
would
not
trust
to
surgeons
and
apothecaries
she
would
have
a
downright
physician
why
not
go
to
the
top
of
the
tree
at
once
and
call
in
short
you
have
heard
of
him
oh
yes
i
have
even
met
him
in
society
a
most
refined
person
i
will
certainly
follow
your
advice
and
consult
him
oh
thank
you
bosanquet
propos
do
you
consider
him
skilful
oh
immensely
he
is
a
particular
friend
of
my
this
was
so
convincing
that
off
went
another
note
and
next
day
a
carriage
and
pair
dashed
up
to
dodd
door
and
short
bent
himself
in
an
arc
got
out
and
slowly
mounted
the
stairs
he
was
six
feet
two
wonderfully
thin
livid
and
fine
homing
head
keen
eye
lantern
jaws
at
sight
of
him
dodd
rose
and
smiled
julia
started
and
sat
trembling
he
stepped
across
the
room
inaudibly
and
after
the
usual
civilities
glanced
at
the
patient
tongue
and
touched
her
wrist
delicately
pulse
is
rapid
said
he
dodd
detailed
the
symptoms
short
listened
within
the
patient
politeness
of
a
gentleman
to
whom
all
this
was
superfluous
he
asked
for
a
sheet
of
and
divided
it
so
gently
he
seemed
to
be
persuading
one
thing
to
be
two
he
wrote
a
pair
of
prescriptions
and
whilst
thus
employed
looked
up
every
now
and
then
and
conversed
with
the
ladies
you
have
a
slight
subscapular
affection
miss
dodd
i
mean
a
little
pain
under
the
no
sir
said
julia
quietly
short
looked
a
little
surprised
his
female
patients
rarely
contradicted
him
was
it
for
them
to
disown
things
he
was
so
a
good
as
to
assign
them
ah
said
he
you
are
not
conscious
of
it
all
the
better
it
must
be
slight
a
mere
uneasiness
no
he
then
numbered
the
prescriptions
and
advised
dodd
to
drop
no
after
the
eighth
day
and
substitute
no
to
be
continued
until
convalescence
he
put
on
his
gloves
to
leave
dodd
then
with
some
hesitation
asked
him
humbly
whether
she
might
ask
him
what
the
disorder
was
certainly
madam
said
he
graciously
your
daughter
is
labouring
under
a
slight
torpidity
of
the
liver
the
first
prescription
is
active
and
is
to
clear
the
gland
itself
and
the
biliary
ducts
of
the
excretory
accumulation
and
the
second
is
exhibited
to
promote
a
healthy
normal
habit
in
that
important
part
of
the
vascular
what
then
it
is
not
hyperaemia
hyperaemia
there
is
no
such
disorder
in
the
you
surprise
me
said
dodd
dr
osmond
certainly
thought
it
was
and
she
consulted
her
little
ivory
tablets
whereon
she
had
written
the
word
but
meantime
short
mind
to
judge
by
his
countenance
was
away
roaming
distant
space
in
search
of
osmond
osmond
osmond
i
do
not
know
that
name
in
oh
oh
oh
cried
julia
and
they
both
live
in
the
same
street
dodd
held
up
her
finger
to
this
outspoken
patient
but
a
light
seemed
to
break
in
on
short
ah
you
mean
osmond
a
surgeon
a
very
respectable
man
a
most
respectable
man
i
do
not
know
a
more
estimable
person
in
his
grade
of
the
profession
than
my
good
friend
osmond
and
so
he
gives
opinions
in
medical
cases
does
he
short
paused
apparently
to
realise
this
phenomenon
in
the
world
of
mind
he
resumed
in
a
different
tone
you
may
have
misunderstood
him
hyperaemia
exists
of
course
since
he
says
so
but
hyperaemia
is
not
a
complaint
it
is
a
symptom
of
biliary
derangement
my
worthy
friend
looks
at
disorders
from
a
mental
point
very
natural
his
interest
lies
that
way
perhaps
you
are
aware
but
profounder
experience
proves
that
mental
sanity
is
merely
one
of
the
results
of
bodily
health
and
i
am
happy
to
assure
you
that
the
biliary
canal
once
cleared
and
the
secretions
restored
to
the
healthy
habit
by
these
prescriptions
the
hyperaemia
and
other
concomitants
of
hepatic
derangement
will
disperse
and
leave
our
interesting
patient
in
the
enjoyment
of
her
natural
intelligence
her
friends
affectionate
admiration
and
above
all
of
a
sound
constitution
ladies
i
have
the
honour
and
the
doctor
eked
out
this
sentence
by
rising
oh
thank
you
short
said
dodd
rising
within
him
you
inspire
me
with
confidence
and
as
if
under
the
influence
of
these
feelings
only
she
took
short
palm
and
pressed
it
of
the
two
hands
which
met
for
a
moment
then
one
was
soft
and
melting
the
other
a
bunch
of
bones
but
both
were
very
white
and
so
equally
adroit
that
a
double
fee
passed
without
the
possibility
of
a
bystander
suspecting
it
for
the
benefit
of
all

with

listless
yawn
i
had
no
idea
that
a
skeleton
was
such
a
gentlemanlike
thing
i
never
saw
one
dodd
admitted
he
was
very
thin
oh
no
mamma
implies
some
little
flesh
when
he
felt
my
pulse
a
chill
struck
to
my
heart
death
in
a
black
suit
seemed
to
steal
up
to
me
and
lay
a
finger
on
my
wrist
and
mark
me
for
his
dodd
forbade
her
to
give
way
to
such
gloomy
ideas
and
expostulated
firmly
with
her
for
judging
learned
men
by
their
bodies
however
said
she
if
the
good
kind
doctor
remedies
do
not
answer
his
expectations
and
mine
i
shall
take
you
to
london
directly
i
do
hope
papa
will
soon
be
at
poor
dodd
was
herself
slipping
into
a
morbid
state
a
mother
collecting
doctors
it
is
a
most
fascinating
kind
of
connoisseurship
grows
on
one
like
drink
like
polemics
like
melodrama
like
the
millennium
like
any
thing
sure
enough
the
very
next
week
she
and
julia
sat
patiently
at
the
morning
levee
of
an
eminent
and
titled
london
surgeon
full
forty
patients
were
before
them
so
they
had
to
wait
and
wait
at
last
they
were
ushered
into
the
and
dodd
entered
on
the
beaten
ground
of
her
daughter
symptoms
the
noble
surgeon
stopped
her
civilly
but
promptly
auscultation
will
give
us
the
clue
said
he
and
drew
his
stethoscope
julia
shrank
and
cast
an
appealing
look
at
her
mother
but
the
impassive
chevalier
reported
on
each
organ
in
turn
without
moving
his
ear
from
the
lungs
pretty
sound
said
he
a
little
plaintively
so
is
the
liver
now
for
the
hum
there
is
no
kardiac
insufficiency
i
think
neither
mitral
nor
tricuspid
if
we
find
no
tendency
to
hypertrophy
we
shall
do
very
well
ah
i
have
succeeded
in
diagnosing
a
slight
diastolic
murmur
very
he
deposited
the
instrument
and
said
not
without
a
certain
shade
of
satisfaction
that
his
research
had
not
been
fruitless
the
heart
is
the
peccant
oh
sir
is
it
serious
said
poor
dodd
by
no
means
try
this
he
scratched
a
prescription
which
would
not
have
misbecome
the
tomb
of
cheops
and
come
again
in
a
ting
he
struck
a
bell
that
ting
said
go
live
guinea
and
let
another
now
said
dodd
sinking
back
in
her
hired
carriage
and
the
tears
were
in
her
patient
eyes
my
own
own
mamma
said
julia
earnestly
do
not
distress
yourself
i
have
no
disease
in
the
world
but
my
old
old
old
one
of
being
a
naughty
wayward
girl
as
for
you
mamma
you
have
resigned
your
own
judgment
to
your
inferiors
and
that
is
both
our
misfortunes
dear
dear
mamma
do
take
me
to
a
doctress
next
time
if
you
have
not
had
to
a
what
love
a
a
female
physician
child
there
is
no
such
thing
no
assurance
is
becoming
a
characteristic
of
our
sex
but
we
have
not
yet
intruded
ourselves
into
the
learned
professions
thank
excuse
me
mamma
there
are
one
or
two
for
the
newspapers
say
dear
there
are
none
in
this
country
not
in
london
then
what
the
use
of
such
a
great
overgrown
place
all
smoke
if
there
is
nothing
in
it
you
can
not
find
in
the
country
let
us
go
back
to
barkington
this
very
day
this
minute
this
instant
oh
pray
and
so
you
shall
but
you
must
pity
your
poor
anxiety
and
see
chalmers
oh
mamma
not
another
surgeon
he
frightened
me
he
hurt
me
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
oh
please
not
another
it
is
not
a
surgeon
dear
it
is
the
court
the
court
physician
detected
a
somewhat
morbid
condition
of
the
great
nervous
to
an
inquiry
whether
there
was
he
replied
pooh
on
being
told
sir
william
had
announced
he
said
ah
alters
the
case
he
maintained
however
that
it
must
be
trifling
and
would
go
no
further
the
nervous
system
once
restored
to
its
healthy
tone
o

o

dodd
returned
home
consoled
and
confused
julia
listless
and
apathetic
tea
was
ordered
with
two
or
three
kinds
of
bread
thinnest
slices
of
meat
and
a
little
blane
mange
their
favourite
repast
after
a
journey
and
whilst
the
tea
was
drawing
dodd
looked
over
the
and
enumerated
the
visitors
that
had
called
during
their
absence
dr
short
osmond
hetherington
alfred
hardie
lady
dewry
and
miss
bosanquet
what
a
pity
edward

dear
alfred
hardie
visit
must
have
been
to
oh
of
course
a
very
manly
young
yes
no
he
is
so
is
he
ah
he
was
ill
just
then
and
pain
irritates
gentlemen
they
are
not
accustomed
to
it
poor
that
is
like
you
dear
mamma
making
excuses
for
julia
added
faintly
but
he
is
so
i
have
a
daughter
who
reconciles
me
to
impetuosity
and
he
have
a
good
heart
he
was
so
kind
to
my
julia
looked
down
smiling
but
presently
seemed
to
be
seized
with
a
spirit
of
contradiction
she
began
to
pick
poor
alfred
to
pieces
he
was
this
that
and
the
other
and
then
so
bold
she
might
say
impudent
dodd
replied
calmly
that
he
was
very
kind
to
her
boy
oh
mamma
you
can
not
approve
all
the
words
he
it
is
not
worth
while
to
remember
all
the
words
young
gentlemen
speak
he
was
very
kind
to
my
boy
i
remember
the
tea
was
now
ready
and
dodd
sat
down
and
patted
a
chair
with
a
smile
of
invitation
for
julia
to
come
and
sit
beside
her
but
julia
said
in
one
minute
dear
and
left
the
room
when
she
came
back
she
fluttered
up
to
her
mother
and
kissed
her
vehemently
then
sat
down
radiant
ah
said
dodd
why
you
are
looking
yourself
once
more
how
do
you
feel
now
better
how
do
i
feel
let
me
see
the
world
seems
one
and
me
the
butterfly
it
all
belongs
she
spake
and
to
confirm
her
words
the
airy
thing
went
waltzing
sailing
and
fluttering
round
the
room
and
sipping
mamma
every
now
and
then
on
the
wing
in
this
buoyancy
she
remained
some
hours
and
then
came
clouds
and
chills
which
in
their
turn
gave
way
to
exultation
duly
followed
by
depression
her
spirits
were
so
uncertain
that
things
too
minute
to
justify
narration
turned
the
scale
either
way
a
word
from
dodd
a
new
face
at
anne
church
looking
devoutly
her
way
a
piece
of
town
gossip
distilled
in
her
ear
by
maxley
and
she
was
sprightly
or
languid
and
both
more
than
reason
one
drizzly
afternoon
they
were
sitting
silent
and
saddish
in
the
dodd
correcting
the
mechanical
errors
in
a
drawing
of
julia
and
admiring
the
rare
dash
and
figure
and
julia
doggedly
studying
whately
logic
with
now
and
then
a
sigh
when
suddenly
a
trumpet
seemed
to
articulate
in
the
little
hall
mestress
doedd
at
home
the
lady
rose
from
her
seat
and
said
with
a
smile
of
pleasure
i
hear
a
the
door
opened
and
in
darted
a
man
with
handsome
but
strongly
marked
features
laughing
and
shouting
like
a
schoolboy
broke
loose
he
cried
out
ah
i
found
y
out
at
dodd
glided
to
meet
him
and
put
out
both
her
hands
the
palms
downwards
with
the
prettiest
air
of
ladylike
cordiality
he
shook
them
heartily
the
vagabins
said

sadly

advice
at

very
well
that
wo
hurt
her
unless

takes
and
he
burst
into
a
ringing
laugh
but
in
the
middle
of
it
stopped
dead
short
and
his
face
elongated
lord
sake
mad
said
he
impressively
mind
what
y
are
at
though
barkton
just
a
trap
for
fanciful
femuls
there
a

called
osmond
and

the
dodd
looked

and
exchanged

glances
with
julia
however
she
said
calmly
i
consulted
osmond
and
short
but
have
not
relied
on
them
alone
i
have
taken
her
to

william

and
to
chalmers
and
to
and
she
felt
invulnerable
behind
her
phalanx
of
learning
and
reputation
good
hivens
roared
the
visitor
what

one
girl

and
the
picter

miss
floree
y
are
tougher
than
ye
my
daughter
name

observed
dodd
a
little
haughtily
but
instantly
recovering
herself
she
said
this
is

therey

th

an
remittency
of

put
in
the
visitor
with
such
prodigious
swiftness
of
elocution
that
the
words
went
tumbling
over
one
another
like
railway
carriages
out
on
pleasure
and
the
sentence
was
a
pile
of
loud
indistinct
syllables
julia
lovely
eyes
dilated
at
this
clishmaclaver
and
she
bowed
coldly
sampson
had
revealed
in
this
short
interview
nearly
all
the
characteristics
of
voice
speech
and
manner
she
had
been
taught
from
infancy
to
shun
boisterous
gesticulatory
idiomatic
and
had
taken
the
discourse
out
of
her
mamma
mouth
twice
now
albion
villa
was
a
red
indian
hut
in
one
respect
here
nobody
interrupted
dodd
had
little
personal
egotism
but
she
had
a
mother
and
could
not
spare
this
opportunity
of
adding
another
doctor
to
her
collection
so
she
said
hurriedly
will
you
permit
me
to
show
you
what
your
learned
confreres
have
prescribed
her
julia
sighed
aloud
and
deprecated
the
subject
with
earnest
furtive
signs
dodd
would
not
see
them
now
sampson
was
himself
afflicted
with
what
i
shall
venture
to
call
a
mental
ailment
to
wit
a
furious
intolerance
of
other
men
opinions
he
had
not
even
patience
to
hear
them
mai
dear
mad
said
he
hastily
when
you
told

their

julia
ejaculated
dodd
this
is
very
no
it
is
not

cried
sampson
defiantly
nothing
is
extraordinary

my

our

it

if

for

and
to
pin
him
to
the
only
medical
theme
which
interested
her
seized
the
opportunity
while
he
was
in
actual
contact
with
julia
wrist
and
rapidly
enumerated
her
symptoms
and
also
told
him
what
osmond
had
said
about
hyperaesthesia
goose
greece
barked
sampson
loud
clear
and
sharp
as
an
irritated
but
this
one
vented
he
was
silent
as
abruptly
dodd
smiled
and
proceeded
to
hyperaemia
and
thence
to
the
antiphlogistic
regimen
at
that
unhappy
adjective
sampson
jumped
up
cast
away
his
hand
forgot
her
existence
she
was
but
a
charming
individual
and
galloped
into
his
native
region
generalities
antiphlogistic
mai
dear
mad
that
one
long
fragmint
of
ass
jaw
has
slain
a
million
adapted
to
the
weakness
of
human
nature
which
receives
with
rivirince
ideas
however
childish
that
come
draped
in
and
exotic
words
that
aasimine
polysyllable
has
riconciled
the
modern
mind
to
the
chimeras
of
th
ancients
and
outbutchered
the
guillotine
the
musket
and
the
sword
ay
and
but
for
me
had
barred
the
door
for
cinturies
more
on
the
great
coming
sceince
the
sceince
of
healing
diseases
instead
of
defining
and
dividing
and
lengthening
their
names
and
their
durashin
and
shortening
nothing
but
the
pashint
th
antiphlogistic
therey
is
this
that
disease
is
fiery
and
that
any
artificial
exhaustion
of
vital
force
must
cool
the
system
and
reduce
the
morbid
fire
called
in
their
donkey
latin
and
in
their
compound
donkey
latin
and
in
their
goose
greece
and
accordingly
th
antiphlogistic
practice
is
to
cool
the
sick
man
by
bleeding
him
and
when
blid
either
to
rebleed
him
with
a
change
of
instrument
bites
and
stabs
instid
of
gashes
or
else
to
rake
the
blid
and
then
blister
the
blid
and
raked
and
then
push
mercury
till
the
teeth
of
the
blid
raked
and
blistered
shake
in
their
sockets
and
to
starve
the
blid
purged
salivated
blistered
wretch
from
first
to
last
this
is
the
antiphlogistic
system
it
is
seldom
carried
out
entire
because
the
pashint
at
the
first
or
second
link
in
their
rimedial
chain
expires
or
else
gives
such
plain
signs
of
sinking
that
even
these
take
fright
and
try
t
undo
their
own
work
not
disease
by
tonics
an
turtle
and
stimulants
which
things
given
at
the
right
time
instead
of
the
wrong
given
when
the
pashint
was
merely
weakened
by
his
disorder
and
not
enfeebled
by
their
didly
rinmedies
would
have
cut
th
ailment
down
in
a
few
dear
me
said
dodd
and
now
my
good
friend
with
respect
to
n
list
clashed
sampson
ye
goen
to
fathom
antiphlogistics
since
they
still
survive
an
slay
in
holes
and
corners
like
barkton
and
i
driven
the
vamperes
out
o
the
cintres
civilisation
begin
with
their
coolers
exhaustion
is
not
a
cooler
it
is
a
feverer
and
they
know
it
the
way
parrots
know
sentences
why
are
we
all
more
or
less
feverish
at
night
because
we
are
weaker
starvation
is
no
cooler
it
is
an
inflamer
and
they
know
it
as
parrots
know
truths
but
ca
apply
them
for
they
know
that
burning
fever
rages
in
ivery
town
street
camp
where
famine
is
as
for
their
prime
cooler
it
is
inflammatory
and
they
know
it
for
the
thumping
heart
and
bounding
pulse
of
pashints
blid
by
butchers
in
black
and
bullocks
blid
by
butchers
in
blue
prove
it
and
they
have
recorded
this
in
all
their
books
yet
stabbed
and
bit
and
starved
and
mercuried
and
murdered
on
but
mind
ye
all
their
sham
coolers
are
real
weakeners
i
wonder
they
did
inventory
satin
and
his
brimstin
lake
among
their
refrijrators
and
this
is
the
point
whence
t
appreciate
their
imbecility
and
the
sairvice
i
have
rendered
mankind
in
been
the
first
t
attack
their
banded
school
at
a
time
it
seemed
ah
this
promises
to
be
very
interesting
sighed
dodd
and
before
you
enter
on
so
large
a
field
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
dispose
of
a
little
matter
which
lies
at
my
heart
here
is
poor
nlissmee
a
human
bean
is
in
a
constant
state
of
flux
and
reflux
his
component
particles
move
change
disappear
and
are
renewed
his
life
is
a
round
of
exhaustion
and
repair
of
this
repair
the
brain
is
the
sovereign
ajint
by
night
and
day
and
the
blood
the
great
living
material
and
digestible
food
th
indispensible
supply
and
this
balance
of
exhaustion
and
repair
is
too
nice
to
tamper
with
dis
a
single
sleepless
night
or
dinnerless
day
write
some
pallor
on
the
face
and
tell
against
the
buddy
so
does
a
single
excessive
perspiration
a
trifling
diary
or
a
cut
finger
though
it
takes
but
half
an
ounce
of
blood
out
of
the
system
and
what
is
the
cause
of
that
rare
ivint
which
occurs
only
to
pashmints
that
ca
afford
docking
dith
from
old
age
think
ye
the
man
really
succumms
under
years
or
is
mowed
down
by
time
nay
yon
just
potry
an
bosh
nashins
have
been
thinned
by
the
lancet
but
niver
by
the
scythe
and
years
are
not
forces
but
misures
of
events
no
centenarius
decays
and
dies
bekase
his
bodil
expindituire
goes
on
and
his
bodil
income
falls
off
by
failure
of
the
reparative
and
reproductive
forces
and
now
suppose
bodil
exhaustion
and
repair
were
a
mere
matter
of
pecuniary
instead
of
vital
economy
what
would
you
say
to
the
steward
or
housekeeper
who
to
balance
your
accounts
and
keep
you
solvent
should
open
every
known
channel
of
expinse
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
stop
the
supplies
yet
this
is
how
the
dockers
for
thirty
cinturies
have
burned
th
human
candle
at
both
ends
yet
wondered
the
light
of
life
expired
under
their
it
seems
irrational
then
in
case
you
would
looksee
a
pashint
falls
sick
what
haps
directly
why
the
balance
is
troubled
and
exhaustion
exceeds
repair
for
proof
obsairve
the
buddy
when
disease
is
fresh
and
you
will
always
find
a
loss
of
flesh
to
put
it
economikly
and
then
you
must
understand
it
bein
a
housekeeper
whativer
the
disease
its
form
or
essence
expinditure
goes
on
and
income
lessens
but
to
this
sick
and
therefore
weak
man
comes
a
docker
purblind
with
cinturies
of
cant
pricidint
blood
and
goose
greece
imagines
him
a
fiery
pervalid
though
the
common
sense
of
mankind
through
its
interpreter
common
language
pronounces
him
an
gashes
him
with
a
lancet
spills
out
the
great
liquid
material
of
all
repair
by
the
gallon
and
fells
this
weak
man
wounded
now
and
pale
and
fainting
with
dith
stamped
on
his
face
to
th
earth
like
a
bayoneted
soldier
or
a
slaughtered
ox
if
the
weak
man
wounded
thus
and
weakened
survives
then
the
chartered
thugs
who
have
drained
him
by
the
turn
to
and
drain
him
by
the
spigot
they
blister
him
and
then
calomel
him
and
lest
nature
should
have
the
ghost
of
a
chance
to
conterbalance
these
frightful
outgoings
they
keep
strong
meat
and
drink
out
of
his
system
emptied
by
their
stabs
bites
purges
mercury
and
blisters
damdijjits
and
that
asia
excipted
was
profissional
midicine
from
hippocrates
to
sampsin
antiphlogistic
is
but
a
modern
name
for
an
rouutine
which
has
niver
varied
a
hair
since
scholastic
midicine
the
silliest
and
didliest
of
all
the
hundred
forms
of
quackery
first
rose
unlike
seeince
art
religion
and
all
true
suns
in
the
west
to
wound
the
sick
to
weaken
the
weak
and
mutilate
the
hurt
and
thin
the
voluble
impugner
of
his
own
profession
delivered
these
two
last
words
in
thunder
so
sudden
and
effective
as
to
strike
julia
work
out
of
her
hands
but
here
as
in
nature
a
moment
pause
followed
the
thunderclap
so
dodd
who
had
long
been
patiently
watching
her
opportunity
smothered
a
shriek
and
edged
in
a
word
this
is
irresistible
you
have
confuted
everybody
to
their
heart
content
and
now
the
question
is
what
course
shall
we
substitute
she
meant
in
the
great
case
which
occupies
but
sampson
attached
a
nobler
wider
sense
to
her
query
what
course
why
the
great
chronothairmal
practice
based
on
the
remittent
and
febrile
character
of
all
disease
above
all
on
the
law
of
perriodicity
a
law
midicine
yet
has
wells
of
light
to
draw
by
remittency
i
mean
th
ebb
of
disease
by
perriodicity
th
ebb
and
also
the
flow
the
paroxysm
and
the
remission
these
remit
and
recur
and
keep
tune
like
the
tides
not
in
ague
and
remittent
fever
only
as
the
profission
imagines
to
this
day
but
in
all
diseases
from
a
scirrhus
in
the
pylorus
t
a
toothache
and
i
discovered
this
and
the
new
path
to
cure
of
all
diseases
it
opens
alone
i
did
it
and
what
my
reward
hooted
insulted
belied
and
called
a
quack
by
the
banded
school
of
profissional
assassins
who
in
their
day
hooted
harvey
and
jinner
authors
too
of
great
discoveries
but
discoveries
narrow
in
their
consequences
compared
with
mine
t
appreciate
chronothairmalism
ye
must
begin
at
the
beginning
so
just
answer
me
what
is
man
at
this
huge
inquiry
whirring
tip
all
in
a
moment
like
a
in
a
wood
dodd
sank
back
in
her
chair
despondent
seeing
her
de
combat
sampson
turned
to
julia
and
demanded
twice
as
loud
what
is
man
julia
opened
two
violet
eyes
at
him
and
then
looked
at
her
mother
for
a
hint
how
to
proceed
how
can
that
child
answer
such
a
question
sighed
dodd
let
us
return
to
the
i
have
never
strayed
an
inch
from
it
it
about
physic
no
excuse
me
it
is
about
a
young
lady
universal
medicine
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
now
this
is
the
way
with
them
all
cried
sampson
furious
there
lowed
john
bull
the
men
and
women
of
this
benighted
nashin
have
an
ear
for
anything
provided
it
matters
nothing
talk
jology
conchology
entomology
theology
meteorology
astronomy
deuteronomy
botheronomy
or
boshology
and
one
is
listened
to
with
rivirence
because
these
are
all
things
in
fogs
but
at
a
word
about
the
great
near
useful
art
of
healing
stop
your
ears
for
why
your
life
and
dailianhourly
happiness
depend
on
it
but
sis
john
bull
the
knowledge
of
our
own
buddies
and
how
to
save
our
own
bakin
beef
i
mean
day
by
day
from
disease
and
chartered
all
that
may
interest
the
thinkers
in
saturn
but
what
the
deevil
is
it
t
talk
t
of
the
buddies
not
of
our
own
babble
o
comets
meteors
an

never

the

but
do
ask
us
to
know
ourselves
ijjits
the
eloquent
speaker
depressed
by
the
perversity
of
englishmen
in
giving
their
minds
to
every
part
of
creation
but
their
bodies
suffered
a
momentary
loss
of
energy
then
dodd
who
had
long
been
watching
glided
in
let
us
compound
you
are
for
curing
all
the
world
beginning
with
nobody
my
ambition
is
to
cure
girl
and
leave
mankind
in
peace
now
if
you
will
begin
with
julia
i
will
submit
to
rectify
the
universe
in
its
proper
turn
any
time
will
do
to
set
the
human
race
right
you
own
it
is
in
no
hurry
but
case
presses
so
do
pray
cure
her
for
me
or
at
least
tell
me
what
her
indisposition
oh
what
did
i
tell
you
well
there
nothing
the
matter
with
at
receiving
this
cavalier
reply
for
the
reward
of
all
her
patience
dodd
was
so
hurt
and
so
nearly
angry
that
she
rose
with
dignity
from
her
seat
her
cheek
actually
pink
and
the
water
in
her
eyes
sampson
saw
she
was
ruffled
and
appealed
to
julia
of
all
people
there
now
miss
julia
said
he
ruefully
she
is
in
a
rage
because
i
wo
humbug
her
poplus
voolt
decipee
i
tell
you
it
is
not
a
midical
case
give
me
disease
and
i
cure
stop
i
tell
ye
what
do
let
her
take
and
swallow
the
barkton
docks
prescriptions
and
butcher
best
and
canting
kinyon
and
after
those
four
tinkers
there
be
plenty
holes
to
mend
then
send
for
me
here
was
irony
dodd
retorted
by
she
turned
on
him
with
a
treacherous
smile
and
said
never
mind
doctors
and
patients
it
is
so
long
since
we
met
i
do
hope
you
will
waive
ceremony
and
dine
with
me
he
accepted
with
pleasure
but
must
return
to
his
inn
first
and
get
rid
of
his
dirty
boots
and
pashints
and
with
this
he
whipped
out
his
watch
and
saw
that
dealing
with
universal
medicine
he
had
disappointed
more
than
one
sick
individual
so
shot
out
as
hard
as
he
had
shot
in
and
left
the
ladies
looking
at
one
another
after
the
phenomenon
well
said
julia
with
a
world
of
meaning
yes
dear
replied
dodd
he
a
little
eccentric
i
think
i
will
request
them
to
make
some
addition
to
the
no
mamma
if
you
please
not
to
put
me
off
so
transparently
if
i
had
interrupted
and
shouted
and
behaved
so
you
would
have
packed
off
to
bed
or
somewhere
do
say
love
dismissed
me
to
ah
cried
julia
that
privileged
person
is
gone
and
we
must
all
mind
our
p
and
q
once
dodd
with
an
air
of
nonchalance
replied
to
the
effect
that
sampson
was
not
her
offspring
and
so
she
was
not
bound
to
correct
his
eccentricities
and
i
suppose
said
she
languidly
we
must
accept
these
extraordinary
people
as
we
find
them
but
that
is
no
reason
why
should
say
and
q
that
day
her
hospitable
board
was
spread
over
a
trap
blessed
with
an
oracle
irrelevantly
fluent
and
dumb
to
the
point
she
had
asked
him
to
dinner
with
maternal
address
he
could
not
be
on
his
guard
eternally
sooner
or
later
through
inadvertence
or
in
a
moment
of
convivial
recklessness
or
in
a
parenthesis
of
some
grand
generality
he
would
cure
her
child
or
perhaps
at
his
rate
of
talking
would
wear
out
all
his
idle
themes
down
to
the
very
of
mankind
and
them
julia
mysterious
indisposition
would
come
on
the
blank
tapis
with
these
secret
hopes
she
presided
at
the
feast
all
grace
and
gentle
amity
julia
too
sat
down
with
a
little
design
but
a
very
different
one
of
being
chilly
company
for
she
disliked
this
new
acquaintance
and
hated
the
science
of
medicine
the
unconscious
object
chatted
away
with
both
and
cut
their
replies
very
short
and
did
strange
things
sent
away
julia
chicken
regardless
of
her
scorn
and
prescribed
mutton
called
for
champagne
and
made
her
drink
it
and
pout
and
thus
excited
dodd
hopes
that
he
was
attending
to
the
case
by
degrees
but
after
dinner
julia
to
escape
medicine
universal
and
particular
turned
to
her
mother
and
dilated
on
treachery
of
her
literary
guide
the
it
said
and
ends
was
a
good
novel
to
read
by
the
seaside
so
i
thought
then
oh
how
different
it
must
be
from
most
books
if
you
can
sit
by
the
glorious
sea
and
even
look
at
it
so
i
sent
for
it
directly
and
would
you
believe
it
was
an
ignoble
thing
all
flirtations
and
curates
the
sea
indeed
a
pond
would
be
fitter
to
read
it
by
and
one
with
a
good
many
geese
was
ever
such
simplicity
said
dodd
why
my
dear
that
phrase
about
the
sea
does
not
anything
i
shall
have
you
believing
that
a
novelist
can
fashionable
folly
and
that
painful
to
one
shopkeeper
has
a
over
a
whole
and
so
on
every
third
phrase
is
of
this
character
a
starling
note
once
it
appears
there
was
an
age
of
gold
and
then
came
one
of
iron
and
then
of
brass
all
these
are
gone
and
the
age
of
has
she
sighed
and
sampson
generalised
he
plunged
from
the
seaside
novel
into
the
sea
of
fiction
he
rechristened
that
joyous
art
feckshin
and
lashed
its
living
professors
you
devour
their
three
volumes
greedily
said
he
but
after
your
meal
you
feel
as
empty
as
a
drum
there
is
no
leading
idea
in
now
there
always
is
in
moliere
and
comprehended
the
midicine
of
his
age
but
what
fundamental
truth
novelists
iver
convey
all
they
can
do
is
pile
incidents
their
customers
dictate
th
article
unideaed
melodrams
for
unideaed
girls
the
writers
and
their
feckshins
belong
to
one
species
and
that
animals
and
their
midicine
is
bosh
why
they
bleed
still
for
falls
and
fevers
and
niver
mention
vital
chronometry
then
they
do
look
straight
at
nature
but
see
with
their
ears
and
repeat
one
another
twelve
deep
now
listen
me
there
are
the
cracters
for
an
feckshin
in
barkington
and
i
write
it
too
only
i
at
this
julia
forgetting
her
resolution
broke
out
romantic
characters
in
barkington
who
who
who
they
be
but
my
pashints
ay
ye
may
lauch
miss
julee
but
wait
till
ye
see
he
was
then
seized
with
a
fit
of
candour
and
admitted
that
some
even
of
his
pashints
were
colourless
indeed
not
to
mince
the
matter
six
or
seven
of
that
sacred
band
were
nullity
in
person
i
can
compare
the
beggars
to
nothing
said
he
but
the
globules
of
the
dee
d
insipid
and
nothing
in
but
the
others
make
up
man
alive
i
got
miser
and
an
attorney
and
an
screw
he
is
a
gardener
with
a
head
like
a
mamma
mamma
that
is
maxley
cried
julia
clapping
her
hands
and
thawing
in
her
own
despite
then
there
my
virgin
martyr
and
my
puppy
they
are
brother
and
sister
and
there
their
father
but
he
is
an
impenetrable
dog
unbosom
howiver
he
sairves
to
draw
chicks
for
the
other
two
and
so
keep
goen
you
know
my
puppy
we
have
not
that
honour
do
we
know
sampson
puppy
love
inquired
dodd
rather
languidly
mamma
i
i
know
no
one
of
that
do
tell
me
why
it
was
he
sent
me
here
told
me
where
you
lived
and
i
was
to
make
haste
for
miss
dodd
was
very
ill
it
is
young
hardie
the
banker
son
ye
dodd
said
but
with
a
very
slight
touch
of
irony
that
really
they
were
very
much
flattered
by
the
interest
alfred
hardie
had
shown
especially
as
her
daughter
had
never
exchanged
ten
words
with
him
julia
coloured
at
this
statement
the
accuracy
of
which
she
had
good
reason
to
doubt
and
the
poor
girl
felt
as
if
an
icicle
passed
swiftly
along
her
back
and
then
for
the
first
the
in
her
life
she
thought
her
mother
hardly
gracious
and
she
wanted
to
say
was
obliged
to
alfred
hardie
but
dared
not
and
despised
herself
for
not
daring
her
composure
was
further
attacked
by
dodd
looking
full
at
her
and
saying
interrogatively
i
wonder
how
that
young
gentleman
could
know
about
your
being
ill
at
this
julia
eyed
her
plate
very
attentively
and
murmured
i
believe
it
is
all
over
the
town
and
seriously
too
so
maxley
says
for
she
tells
me
that
in
barkington
if
more
than
one
doctor
is
sent
for
that
bodes
ill
for
the
deevelich
ill
cried
sampson
heartily
for
two
physicians
like
a
pair
of
oars
conduck
him
faster
to
the
styjjin
garth
julia
looked
him
in
the
face
and
coldly
ignored
this
perversion
of
maxley
meaning
and
dodd
returned
pertinaciously
to
the
previous
topic
mr
alfred
hardie
interests
me
he
was
good
to
edward
i
am
curious
to
know
why
you
call
him
a
puppy
only
because
he
is
one
and
that
is
no
reason
at
all
with
six
he
is
a
juveneel
pidant
and
a
puppy
and
contradicts
ivery
new
truth
bekase
it
is
in
aristotle
and
th
eton
grammar
and
such
a
chatterbox
ye
ca
get
in
a
word
idgeways
and
he
and
his
sister
that
my
virgin
martyr
are
a
farce
keeps
sneerin
at
her
relijjin
and
that
puts
in
such
a
rage
she
threatens
intercede
for
him
at
the
jargon
sighed
dodd
and
just
shrugged
her
lovely
shoulders
we
breathe
it
we
float
in
an
atmosphere
of
it
my
love
and
she
floated
out
of
the
room
and
julia
floated
after
sampson
sat
meditating
on
the
gullibility
of
man
in
matters
medical
this
favourite
speculation
detained
him
late
and
almost
his
first
word
on
entering
the
was
good
night
little
julia
coloured
at
this
broad
hint
drew
herself
up
and
lighted
a
bedcandle
she
went
to
dodd
kissed
her
and
whispered
in
her
ear
i
hate
him
and
as
she
retired
her
whole
elegant
person
launched
ladylike
defiance
under
which
brave
exterior
no
little
uneasiness
was
hidden
oh
what
will
become
of
me
thought
she
if
has
gone
and
told
him
about
henley
let
see
the
prescriptions
said
sampson
delighted
at
this
concession
dodd
took
them
out
of
her
desk
and
spread
them
earnestly
he
ran
his
eye
over
them
and
pointed
out
that
the
man
and
the
nerve
man
had
prescribed
the
same
medicine
on
irreconcilable
grounds
and
a
medicine
moreover
whose
effect
on
the
nerves
was
and
on
the
mucous
membrane
was
not
to
soothe
it
but
plough
it
and
harrow
it
and
did
not
that
open
her
eyes
he
then
reminded
her
that
all
these
doctors
in
consultation
would
have
contrived
to
agree
but
you
said
he
have
baffled
the
collusive
hoax
by
which
dox
arrived
at
a
sham
uniformity
honest
uniformity
can
never
exist
till
scientific
principles
obtain
listme
to
begin
is
the
pashint
in
love
the
doctor
put
this
query
in
just
the
same
tone
in
which
they
inquire
any
expectoration
but
dodd
in
reply
was
less
dry
and
she
started
and
looked
aghast
this
possibility
had
once
for
a
moment
occurred
to
her
but
only
to
be
rejected
the
evidence
being
all
against
it
in
love
said
she
that
child
and
i
not
know
it
he
said
he
had
never
supposed
that
but
i
thought
i
just
ask
ye
for
she
has
no
bodily
ailment
and
the
passions
are
all
counterfeit
diseases
they
are
connected
like
all
diseases
with
cerebral
instability
have
their
hearts
and
chills
like
all
diseases
and
their
paroxysms
and
remissions
like
all
diseases
nlistme
you
have
detected
the
signs
of
a
slight
cerebral
instability
i
have
ascertained
absence
of
all
physical
cause
then
why
make
this
healthy
buddy
a
for
poisons
sovereign
drugs
i
deal
with
no
other
i
leave
the
nullities
to
the
noodles
are
either
counterpoisons
or
poisons
and
here
there
is
nothing
to
counterpoison
at
prisent
so
for
caushin
and
working
on
the
safe
side
th
hidge
till
we
are
less
in
the
dark
mind
ye
young
women
at
her
age
are
kittle
cattle
they
have
gusts
o
this
and
gusts
o
that
th
unreasonable
imps
d
see
these
two
pieces
pasteboard
they
are
tickets
for
a
ball
in
barkton
yes
of
course
i
see
them
said
dodd
dolefully
well
i
prescribe
and
when
they
have
been
taken
and
the
pashint
well
shaken
perhaps
we
shall
see
whether
we
are
on
the
right
system
and
if
so
we
dose
her
with
youthful
society
in
a
more
irrashinal
form
conversaziones
cookeyshines
et
citera
and
if
we
find
ourselves
on
the
wrong
why
then
we
hark
stick
blindly
to
course
the
dockers
cry
but
it
does
me
harm
do
good
where
lairned
ye
that
echoes
of
echoes
say
the
killer
ploughs
course
the
healer
his
way
so
mysterious
are
the
operations
of
the
human
mind
that
when
we
have
exploded
in
verse
tuneful
as
the
above
we
lapse
into
triumph
instead
of
penitence
not
that
doggrel
meets
with
reverence
here
below
the
statues
to
it
are
few
and
not
in
marble
but
in
the
material
itself
but
then
an
impromptu
a
moment
ago
our
posy
was
not
and
now
is
with
the
speed
if
not
the
brilliancy
of
lightning
we
have
added
a
handful
to
the
intellectual
of
an
oppressed
nation
from
this
bad
eminence
sampson
then
looked
down
complacently
and
saw
dodd
face
as
long
as
his
arm
she
was
one
that
held
current
opinions
and
the
world
does
not
believe
poetry
can
sing
the
practical
verse
and
useful
knowledge
pass
for
incompatibles
and
though
doggrel
is
not
poetry
yet
it
has
a
lumbering
proclivity
that
way
and
so
forfeits
the
confidence
of
grave
sensible
people
this
versification
and
this
impalpable
and
unprecedented
prescription
she
had
waited
for
so
long
seemed
all
of
a
piece
to
poor
mamma
wild
unpractical
and
oh
horror
horror
eccentric
sampson
read
her
sorrowful
face
after
his
fashion
oh
i
see
cried
he
cure
is
not
welcome
unless
it
comes
in
the
form
consecrated
by
cinturies
of
slaughter
well
then
give
me
a
he
took
the
paper
and
rent
it
asunder
and
wrote
this
on
the
larger
fragment

he
handed
this
with
a
sort
of
spiteful
twinkle
to
dodd
and
her
countenance
lightened
again
her
sex
will
generally
compound
with
whoever
can
give
as
well
as
take
now
she
had
extracted
a
real
grave
prescription
she
acquiesced
in
the
ball
though
not
a
county
one
to
satisfy
your
whim
my
good
kind
friend
to
whom
i
owe
so
sampson
called
on
his
way
back
to
town
and
in
course
of
conversation
praised
nature
for
her
beautiful
instincts
one
of
which
he
said
had
inspired
miss
julee
at
a
credulous
age
not
to
swallow
the
didly
drastics
of
the
tinkering
dodd
smiled
and
requested
permission
to
contradict
him
her
daughter
had
taken
the
several
prescriptions
sampson
inquired
brusquely
if
she
took
him
for
a
fool
she
replied
calmly
no
for
a
very
clever
but
opinionated
personage
opinionated
so
is
ivery
man
who
has
grounnds
for
his
opinin
d
think
because
dockers
short
an
bist
an
kinyon
an
cuckoo
jackdaw
an
starling
an
do
know
the
dire
effecks
of

an
drastics
on
the

i
do
her
eye
her
tongue
her
skin
her
voice
her
elastic
walk
all
tell
she
has
not
been
robbed
of
her
vital
resources
if
she
had
taken
that
genteel
old
thief
short
rimidies
alone
the
girl
gums
would
be
sore
and
herself
at
dith
dodd
was
amused
julia
this
is
so
like
the
gentlemen
they
are
in
love
with
argumeunt
they
go
on
till
they
reason
themselves
out
of
their
reason
why
beat
about
the
bush
when
there
she
sits
what
go
t
a
wumman
for
the
truth
when
i
can
go
t
infallible
inference
you
may
always
go
to
my
david
daughter
for
the
truth
said
dodd
with
dignity
she
then
looked
the
inquiry
and
julia
replied
to
her
look
as
follows
first
she
coloured
very
high
then
she
hid
her
face
in
both
her
hands
then
rose
and
turning
her
neck
swiftly
darted
a
glance
of
fiery
indignation
and
bitter
reproach
on
dr
meddlesome
and
left
the
apartment
mighty
maircy
on
us
cried
sampson
did
ye
see
that
yon
just
a
bonny
basilisk
another
such
thunderbolt
as
she
dispinsed
and
ye
be
ringing
for
your
maid
to
sweep
up
the
good
physician
julia
did
not
return
till
the
good
physician
was
gone
back
to
london
then
she
came
in
with
a
rush
and
demonstrative
toad
embraced
dodd
knees
and
owned
she
had
cultivated
her
geraniums
with
all
those
medicines
liquid
and
solid
and
only
one
geranium
had
died
there
is
a
fascinating
age
when
an
intelligent
girl
is
said
to
fluctuate
between
childhood
and
womanhood
let
me
add
that
these
seeming
fluctuations
depend
much
on
the
company
she
is
in
the
budding
virgin
is
princess
of
chameleons
and
to
confine
ourselves
to
her
two
most
piquant
contrasts
by
her
mother
side
she
is
always
more
or
less
childlike
but
let
a
nice
young
fellow
engage
her
apart
and
hey
presto
she
shall
be
every
inch
a
woman
perhaps
at
no
period
of
her
life
are
the
purely
mental
characteristics
of
her
sex
so
supreme
in
her
thus
her
type
the
rosebud
excels
in
essence
of
rosehood
the
rose
itself
my
reader
has
seen
julia
dodd
play
both
parts
but
it
is
her
face
she
has
now
been
turning
for
several
pages
so
it
may
be
prudent
to
remind
him
she
has
shone
on
alfred
hardie
in
but
one
light
a
young
but
woman
had
she
shown
my
puppy
her
childish
qualities
he
would
have
despised
her
he
had
left
that
department
himself
so
recently
but
nature
guarded
the
budding
fair
from
such
a
disaster
we
left
alfred
hardie
standing
in
the
moonlight
gazing
at
her
lodging
this
was
sudden
but
let
slow
coaches
deny
it
as
loudly
as
they
like
fast
coaches
exist
and
love
is
a
passion
which
like
hate
envy
avarice
has
risen
to
a
great
height
in
a
single
day
not
that
alfred
was
love
at
first
sight
for
he
had
seen
her
beauty
in
the
full
blaze
of
day
with
no
deeper
feeling
than
admiration
but
in
the
moonlight
he
came
under
more
sovereign
spells
than
a
fair
face
her
virtues
and
her
voice
the
narrative
of
their
meeting
has
indicated
the
first
and
as
to
the
latter
julia
was
not
one
of
those
whose
beauty
goes
out
with
the
candle
her
voice
was
that
rich
mellow
moving
organ
which
belongs
to
no
rank
nor
station
is
born
not
made
and
flow
it
from
the
lips
of
dairymaid
or
countess
touches
every
heart
gentle
or
simple
that
is
truly
male
and
this
divine
contralto
full
yet
penetrating
dame
nature
had
inspired
her
to
lower
when
she
was
moved
or
excited
instead
of
raising
it
and
then
she
was
enchanting
all
unconsciously
she
cast
this
crowning
spell
on
alfred
and
he
adored
her
in
a
word
he
caught
a
away
from
its
mother
his
fluttering
captive
turned
put
on
composure
and
bewitched
him
she
left
him
and
the
moonlight
night
seemed
to
blacken
but
within
his
young
breast
all
was
light
new
light
he
leaned
opposite
her
window
in
an
elysian
reverie
and
let
the
hours
go
by
he
seemed
to
have
vegetated
till
then
and
lo
true
life
had
dawned
he
thought
he
should
love
to
die
for
her
and
when
he
was
calmer
he
felt
he
was
to
live
for
her
and
welcomed
his
destiny
with
rapture
he
passed
the
rest
of
the
oxford
term
in
a
soft
ecstasy
called
often
on
edward
and
took
a
sudden
and
prodigious
interest
in
him
and
counted
the
days
glide
by
and
the
happy
time
draw
near
when
he
should
be
four
months
in
the
same
town
with
his
enchantress
this
one
did
not
trouble
the
doctors
he
glowed
with
a
steady
fire
no
heats
and
chills
and
sad
misgivings
for
one
thing
he
was
not
a
woman
a
being
tied
to
that
stake
suspense
and
compelled
to
wait
and
wait
for
others
actions
to
him
life
path
seemed
paved
with
roses
and
himself
to
march
in
eternal
sunshine
buoyed
by
perfumed
wings
he
came
to
barkington
to
try
for
the
lovely
prize
then
first
he
had
to
come
down
from
love
sky
and
realise
how
hard
it
is
here
below
to
court
a
young
lady
who
is
guarded
by
a
mother
without
an
introduction
in
the
usual
form
the
obvious
course
was
to
call
on
edward
having
parted
from
him
so
lately
he
forced
himself
to
wait
a
few
days
and
then
set
out
for
albion
villa
as
he
went
along
he
arranged
the
coming
dialogue
for
all
the
parties
edward
was
to
introduce
him
dodd
to
recognise
his
friendship
for
her
son
he
was
to
say
he
was
the
gainer
by
it
julia
silent
at
first
was
to
hazard
a
timid
observation
and
he
to
answer
gracefully
and
draw
her
out
and
find
how
he
stood
in
her
opinion
the
sprightly
affair
should
end
by
his
inviting
edward
to
dinner
that
should
lead
to
their
inviting
him
in
turn
and
then
he
should
have
a
word
with
julia
and
find
out
what
houses
she
visited
and
get
introduced
to
their
proprietors
arrived
at
this
point
his
mind
went
over
hedge
and
ditch
faster
than
my
poor
pen
can
follow
as
the
crow
flies
so
flew
he
and
had
reached
the
under
a
rain
of
nosegays
with
julia
in
imagination
by
then
he
arrived
at
albion
villa
in
the
body
yet
he
knocked
timidly
his
heart
beat
almost
as
hard
as
his
hand
sarah
the
housemaid
answered
the
mr
edward
dodd
not
at
home
sir
left
last
for
long
i
do
rightly
know
sir
but
he
wo
be
back
this
week
i
perhaps
stammered
alfred
the
ladies
dodd
might
be
able
to
tell
oh
yes
sir
but
my
mistress
she
in
london
just
alfred
eyes
flashed
could
i
learn
from
miss
dodd
la
sir
she
is
in
london
along
with
her
ma
why
is
for
her
they
are
gone
to
insult
the
great
he
started
she
is
not
ill
nothing
serious
well
sir
we
do
hope
not
she
is
pinning
a
bit
as
young
ladies
alfred
was
anything
but
consoled
by
this
account
he
became
alarmed
and
looked
wretched
seeming
him
so
perturbed
sarah
who
was
blunt
but
added
but
cook
she
says
hard
work
would
cure
our
miss
of
all
ails
but
who
shall
i
say
was
asking
for
my
work
is
a
bit
alfred
took
the
hint
reluctantly
and
drew
out
his
saying
for
edward
she
gave
her
clean
but
wettish
hand
a
hasty
wipe
with
her
apron
and
took
the
card
he
retired
she
stood
on
the
step
and
watched
him
out
of
sight
said
oho
and
took
his
card
to
the
kitchen
for
preliminary
inspection
and
discussion
alfred
hardie
was
resolute
but
sensitive
he
had
come
on
the
wings
of
love
and
hope
he
went
away
heavily
a
housemaid
tongue
had
shod
his
elastic
feet
with
lead
in
a
moment
of
all
misfortunes
sickness
was
what
he
had
not
anticipated
for
she
looked
immortal
perhaps
it
was
that
fair
and
treacherous
disease
consumption
well
if
it
was
he
would
love
her
all
the
more
would
wed
her
as
soon
as
he
was
of
age
and
carry
her
to
some
soft
southern
clime
and
keep
each
noxious
air
at
bay
and
prolong
her
life
perhaps
save
it
and
now
he
began
to
chafe
at
the
social
cobwebs
that
kept
him
from
her
but
just
as
his
impatience
was
about
to
launch
him
into
imprudence
he
was
saved
by
a
genuine
descendant
of
adam
james
maxley
kept
hardie
little
pleasaunce
trim
as
trim
could
be
by
yearly
contract
this
entailed
short
but
frequent
visits
and
alfred
often
talked
with
him
for
the
man
was
really
a
bit
of
a
character
had
a
shrewd
rustic
wit
and
a
ready
tongue
was
rather
too
fond
of
law
and
much
too
fond
of
money
but
scrupulously
honest
head
as
long
as
cudworth
but
broader
and
could
not
read
a
line
one
day
he
told
alfred
that
he
must
knock
off
now
and
take
a
look
in
at
albion
villee
the
captain
was
due
and
on
no
account
would
he
maxley
allow
that
there
ragged
box
round
the
captains
that
is
how
he
do
name
their
little
mossel
of
a
lawn
and
there
he
walks
for
a
wager
athirt
and
across
across
and
athirt
five
steps
and
then
about
and
i
bet
ye
a
halfpenny
he
thinks
hisself
on
the
salt
sea
ocean
bless
his
silly
old
all
this
time
alfred
after
the
first
start
of
joyful
surprise
was
secretly
thanking
his
stars
for
sending
him
an
instrument
to
learn
whether
she
had
returned
he
asked
maxley
whether
the
ladies
had
sent
for
him
not
they
said
maxley
rather
contemptuously
what
do
care
about
a
border
without
is
a
lace
one
to
their
nightcaps
for
none
but
the
father
of
all
vanity
to
see
not
as
i
have
ought
to
say
again
the
pair
they
keep
their
turf
tidyish
and
pay
ready
money
and
a
few
flowers
in
their
pots
but
the
rest
may
shift
for
itself
ye
see
master
alfred
explained
maxley
wagging
his
head
wisely
nobody
pride
can
be
everywhere
now
theirs
is
their
it
like
the
queen
palace
my
missus
tells
me
she
is
wrapped
up
in
ye
know
but
the
captain
for
my
the
sage
shouldered
his
tools
and
departed
but
he
left
a
good
hint
behind
him
alfred
hovered
about
the
the
next
day
till
he
caught
maxley
she
supplied
the
house
with
eggs
and
vegetables
could
she
tell
him
whether
his
friend
edward
dodd
was
likely
to
come
home
soon
she
thought
not
he
was
gone
away
to
study
he
have
much
you
know
not
like
what
miss
julia
have
and
miss
are
to
be
home
they
wrote
to
cook
this
morning
i
shall
be
there
sartain
and
i
ask
in
the
kitchen
when
master
edward
is
she
prattled
on
the
ladies
of
albion
villa
were
good
kind
ladies
the
very
loved
them
miss
was
more
for
religion
than
her
mother
and
went
to
anne
church
thursday
evenings
and
sundays
morning
and
evening
and
visited
some
poor
women
in
the
parish
with
food
and
clothes
dodd
could
not
sleep
a
wink
when
the
wind
blew
hard
at
night
but
never
complained
only
came
down
pale
to
breakfast
miss
julia
ailment
was
nothing
to
speak
of
but
they
were
in
care
along
of
being
so
wrapped
up
in
her
and
no
wonder
for
if
ever
there
was
a
duck
acting
on
this
intelligence
alfred
went
early
the
next
sunday
to
anne
church
and
sat
down
in
the
side
gallery
at
its
east
end
while
the
congregation
flowed
quietly
in
the
organist
played
the
of
mozart
those
pious
tender
tones
stole
over
his
hot
young
heart
and
whispered
peace
be
still
he
sighed
wearily
and
it
passed
through
his
mind
that
it
might
have
been
better
for
him
and
especially
for
his
studies
if
he
had
never
seen
her
suddenly
the
aisle
seemed
to
lighten
up
she
was
gliding
along
it
beautiful
as
may
and
modesty
itself
in
dress
and
carriage
she
went
into
a
pew
and
kneeled
a
minute
then
seated
herself
and
looked
out
the
lessons
for
the
day
alfred
gazed
at
her
face
devoured
it
but
her
eyes
never
roved
she
seemed
to
have
put
off
feminine
curiosity
and
the
world
at
the
church
door
indeed
he
wished
she
was
not
quite
so
heavenly
discreet
her
lashes
were
delicious
but
he
longed
to
see
her
eyes
once
more
to
catch
a
glance
from
them
and
by
it
decipher
his
fate
but
no
she
was
there
to
worship
and
did
not
discern
her
earthly
lover
whose
longing
looks
were
glued
to
her
and
his
body
rose
and
sank
with
the
true
worshippers
but
with
no
more
spirituality
than
a
piston
or
a
in
the
last
hymn
before
the
sermon
a
worshipper
in
the
gallery
delivered
a
leading
note
a
high
one
with
great
zeal
but
small
precision
being
about
a
semitone
flat
at
this
outrage
on
her
ear
julia
dodd
turned
her
head
swiftly
to
discover
the
offender
and
failed
but
her
two
sapphire
eyes
met
she
was
crimson
in
a
moment
and
lowered
them
on
her
book
again
as
if
to
look
that
way
was
to
sin
it
was
but
a
flash
but
sometimes
a
flash
fires
a
mine
the
lovely
blush
deepened
and
spread
before
it
melted
away
and
late
cooling
heart
warmed
itself
at
that
sweet
glowing
cheek
she
never
looked
his
way
again
not
once
which
was
a
sad
disappointment
but
she
blushed
again
and
again
before
the
service
ended
only
not
so
deeply
now
there
was
nothing
in
the
sermon
to
make
her
blush
i
might
add
there
was
nothing
to
redden
her
cheek
with
religious
excitement
there
was
a
little
candid
sourness
oil
and
vinegar
against
sects
and
low
churchmen
but
thin
generality
predominated
total
acetate
of
morphia
for
dry
souls
to
sip
so
alfred
took
all
the
credit
of
causing
those
sweet
irrelevant
blushes
and
gloated
the
young
wretch
could
not
help
glorying
in
his
power
to
tint
that
fair
statue
of
devotion
with
earthly
thoughts
but
stay
that
dear
blush
was
it
pleasure
or
pain
what
if
the
sight
of
him
was
intolerable
he
would
know
how
he
stood
with
her
and
on
the
spot
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
leave
the
church
he
made
for
the
churchyard
gate
and
walked
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
by
it
with
throbbing
heart
till
she
came
out
she
was
prepared
for
him
now
and
bowed
slightly
to
him
with
the
most
perfect
composure
and
no
legible
sentiment
except
a
certain
marked
politeness
many
of
our
young
ladies
think
wasted
upon
young
gentlemen
and
are
mistaken
alfred
took
off
his
hat
in
a
tremor
and
his
eyes
implored
and
inquired
but
met
with
no
further
response
and
she
walked
swiftly
home
though
without
apparent
effort
he
looked
longingly
after
her
but
discretion
forbade
he
now
crawled
by
albion
villa
twice
every
day
wet
or
dry
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
her
twice
at
the
window
he
was
constant
at
anne
church
and
one
thursday
crept
into
the
aisle
to
be
nearer
to
her
and
he
saw
her
steal
one
swift
look
at
the
gallery
and
look
grave
but
soon
she
detected
him
and
though
she
looked
no
more
towards
him
she
seemed
demurely
complacent
alfred
had
learned
to
note
these
subtleties
now
for
love
is
a
microscope
what
he
did
not
know
was
that
his
timid
ardour
was
pursuing
a
masterly
course
that
to
find
herself
furtively
followed
everywhere
and
hovered
about
for
a
look
is
apt
to
soothe
womanly
pride
and
stir
womanly
pity
and
to
keep
the
female
heart
in
a
flutter
of
curiosity
and
emotions
two
porters
that
open
the
heart
great
gate
to
love
now
the
evening
before
his
visit
to
the
dodds
sampson
dined
with
the
hardies
and
happened
to
mention
the
dodds
among
his
old
patients
the
dodds
of
albion
villa
inquired
miss
hardie
to
her
no
little
surprise
albyn
fiddlestick
said
the
polished
doctor
no
they
live
by
the
used
to
but
now
they
have
left
the
town
i
hear
he
is
a
and
a
fine
lad
and
dodd
is
just
the
woman
i
ever
prescribed
for
except
it
the
dodds
of
albion
villa
said
miss
hardie
they
have
two
children
a
son
his
name
is
edward
and
a
daughter
julia
she
is
rather
a
gentleman
alfred
stared
at
his
sister
was
she
blind
with
her
rather
sampson
was
quite
pleased
at
the
information
n
listen
me
i
saved
that
girl
life
when
she
was
a
year
then
she
is
ill
now
doctor
said
alfred
hastily
do
go
and
see
her
hum
the
fact
is
her
brother
is
a
great
favourite
of
he
then
told
him
how
to
find
albion
villa
jenny
dear
said
he
when
sampson
was
gone
you
never
told
me
you
knew
knew
who
dear
whom
why
dodd
oh
she
is
a
new
acquaintance
and
not
one
to
interest
you
we
only
meet
in
the
lord
i
do
not
visit
albion
villa
her
mother
is
an
amiable
unpardonable
combination
said
alfred
with
a
slight
sneer
so
you
and
miss
dodd
meet
only
at
church
at
church
hardly
she
goes
to
anne
sits
under
a
preacher
who
starves
his
flock
with
moral
discourses
and
holds
out
the
sacraments
of
the
church
as
the
means
of
alfred
shook
his
head
now
jenny
that
is
a
challenge
and
you
know
we
both
got
into
a
fury
the
last
time
we
were
betrayed
into
that
miserable
waste
of
time
and
temper
theological
discussion
no
no
let
sects
delight
to
bark
and
bite
for
is
their
nature
to
let
gown
and
surplice
growl
and
fight
for
satan
makes
them
so
but
let
you
and
i
cut
high
church
and
low
church
and
be
brother
and
sister
do
tell
me
in
english
where
you
meet
julia
dodd
that
a
dear
for
young
ladies
in
the
lord
conveys
no
positive
idea
to
my
jane
hardie
sighed
at
this
confession
we
meet
in
the
cottages
of
the
poor
and
the
sick
whom
he
loved
and
pitied
when
on
earth
and
we
his
unworthy
servants
try
to
soothe
their
distress
and
lead
them
to
him
who
can
heal
the
soul
as
well
as
the
body
and
wipe
away
all
the
tears
of
all
his
then
it
does
you
infinite
credit
jane
said
alfred
warmly
now
that
is
the
voice
of
true
religion
and
not
the
whine
of
this
sect
nor
the
snarl
of
that
and
so
she
joins
you
in
this
good
work
i
am
not
we
meet
in
it
now
and
then
dear
but
she
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
joined
me
i
have
a
district
you
know
but
poor
dodd
will
not
allow
julia
to
enlist
in
the
service
she
visits
independently
and
by
fits
and
starts
and
i
am
afraid
she
thinks
more
of
comforting
their
perishable
bodies
than
of
feeding
their
souls
it
was
but
the
other
day
she
confessed
to
me
her
backwardness
to
speak
in
the
way
of
instruction
to
women
as
old
as
her
mother
she
finds
it
so
much
easier
to
let
them
run
on
about
their
earthly
troubles
and
of
course
it
is
much
ah
the
world
holds
her
still
in
some
of
its
subtle
the
speaker
uttered
this
sadly
but
presently
brightening
up
said
with
considerable
and
almost
a
sprightly
air
but
she
is
a
dear
girl
and
the
lord
will
yet
light
her
alfred
pulled
a
face
as
of
one
that
drinketh
verjuice
unawares
but
let
it
pass
hypercriticism
was
not
his
cue
just
then
well
jenny
said
he
i
have
a
favour
to
ask
you
introduce
me
to
your
friend
miss
dodd
will
you
miss
hardie
coloured
faintly
i
would
rather
not
dear
alfred
the
introduction
could
not
be
for
her
eternal
good
julia
soul
is
in
a
very
ticklish
state
she
wavers
as
yet
between
this
world
and
the
other
world
and
it
wo
do
it
wo
do
there
is
no
middle
path
you
would
very
likely
turn
the
scale
and
then
i
should
have
fought
against
her
everlasting
welfare
my
what
am
i
an
infidel
inquired
alfred
angrily
jane
looked
distressed
oh
no
alfred
but
you
are
a
alfred
smothering
a
strong
sense
of
irritation
besought
her
to
hear
reason
these
big
words
were
out
of
place
here
it
is
dodd
sister
and
he
will
introduce
me
at
a
word
worldling
as
i
then
why
urge
me
to
do
it
against
my
conscience
asked
the
young
lady
as
sharply
as
if
she
had
been
a
woman
of
the
world
you
can
not
be
in
with
her
as
you
do
not
know
alfred
did
not
reply
to
this
unlucky
thrust
but
made
a
last
effort
to
soften
her
can
you
call
yourself
my
sister
and
refuse
me
this
trifling
service
which
her
brother
who
loves
her
and
esteems
her
ten
times
more
sincerely
than
you
do
would
not
think
of
refusing
me
if
he
was
at
home
why
should
he
he
is
in
the
flesh
himself
let
the
carnal
introduce
one
another
i
really
must
decline
but
i
am
very
very
sorry
that
you
feel
hurt
about
and
i
am
very
sorry
i
have
not
an
amiable
worldling
for
my
sister
instead
of
an
unamiable
and
devilish
conceited
and
with
these
bitter
words
alfred
snatched
a
candle
and
bounced
to
bed
in
a
fury
so
apt
is
one
passion
to
rouse
up
others
jane
hardie
let
fall
a
gentle
tear
but
consoled
herself
with
the
conviction
that
she
had
done
her
duty
and
that
alfred
anger
was
quite
unreasonable
and
so
he
would
see
as
soon
as
he
should
cool
the
next
day
the
lover
smarting
under
this
check
and
spurred
to
fresh
efforts
invaded
sampson
that
worthy
was
just
going
to
dine
at
albion
villa
so
alfred
postponed
pumping
him
till
next
day
well
he
called
at
the
inn
next
day
and
if
the
doctor
was
not
just
gone
back
to
london
alfred
wandered
disconsolate
homewards
in
the
middle
of
buchanan
street
an
agitated
treble
called
after
him
mr
halfred
hoh
halfred
he
looked
back
and
saw
dick
absalom
a
promising
young
cricketer
brandishing
a
document
and
imploring
aid
oh
master
halfred
dooce
please
come
here
i
durst
leave
the
there
is
a
tie
between
cricketers
far
too
strong
for
social
distinctions
to
divide
and
though
alfred
muttered
peevishly
whose
cat
is
dead
now
he
obeyed
the
strange
summons
the
distress
was
a
singular
one
master
absalom
i
must
premise
was
the
youngest
of
two
lads
in
the
employ
of
jenner
a
benevolent
old
chemist
a
disciple
of
malthus
jenner
taught
the
virtues
of
drugs
and
minerals
to
tender
youths
at
the
expense
of
the
public
scarcely
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
since
a
pretty
servant
girl
came
into
the
shop
and
laid
a
paper
on
the
counter
saying
please
to
make
that
up
young
now
at
fifteen
we
are
gratified
by
inaccuracies
of
this
kind
from
ripe
female
lips
so
master
absalom
took
the
prescription
with
a
complacent
grin
his
eye
glanced
over
it
it
fell
to
shaking
in
his
hand
chill
dismay
penetrated
his
heart
and
to
speak
with
oriental
strictness
his
liver
turned
instantly
to
water
however
he
made
a
feeble
clutch
at
mercantile
mendacity
and
stammered
out
here
a
many
ingredients
and
the
governor
out
walking
and
he
been
and
locked
the
drawer
where
we
keeps
our
haulhoppy
you
could
come
again
in
half
an
hour
miss
could
ye
she
acquiesced
readily
for
she
was
not
habitually
called
miss
and
she
had
a
follower
a
languid
one
living
hard
by
and
belonged
to
a
class
which
thinks
it
consistent
to
come
after
its
followers
dicky
saw
her
safe
off
and
groaned
at
his
ease
here
was
a
prescription
full
of
new
chemicals
sovereign
no
doubt
deadly
when
applied
jennerically
and
the
very
directions
for
use
were
in
latin
words
he
had
encountered
in
no
prescription
before
a
year
ago
dicky
would
have
counted
the
prescribed
ingredients
on
his
fingers
and
then
taken
down
an
equal
number
of
little
articles
solid
or
liquid
mixed
them
delivered
them
and
so
to
cricket
serene
but
now
his
mind
to
apply
the
universal
cant
was
in
a
transition
a
year
practice
had
chilled
the
youthful
valour
which
used
to
scatter
epsom
salts
or
oxalic
acid
magnesia
or
corrosive
sublimate
an
experiment
or
two
by
himself
and
his
compeers
with
comments
by
the
coroner
had
enlightened
him
as
to
the
final
result
on
the
human
body
of
potent
chemicals
fearlessly
administered
leaving
him
dark
as
to
their
distinctive
qualities
applied
remedially
what
should
he
do
run
with
the
prescription
to
old
taylor
in
the
next
street
a
chemist
of
forty
years
alas
at
his
tender
age
he
had
not
omitted
to
chaff
that
reverend
rival
persistently
and
publicly
humble
his
establishment
before
the
king
street
one
sooner
perish
drugs
and
come
eternal
cricket
and
after
all
why
not
and
and
other
imps
of
his
age
that
dealt
destruction
did
not
depopulate
gratis
mankind
acknowledged
their
services
in
cash
but
old
jenner
taught
by
philosophy
through
its
organ
the
newspapers
that
knowledge
is
riches
was
above
diluting
with
a
few
shillings
a
week
the
wealth
a
boy
acquired
behind
his
counter
so
his
apprentices
got
no
salary
then
why
not
shut
up
the
old
rogue
shutters
and
excite
a
little
sympathy
for
him
to
be
followed
by
a
powerful
reaction
on
his
return
from
walking
and
go
and
offer
his
own
services
on
the
to
field
for
the
gentlemen
by
the
hour
or
bowl
at
a
shilling
on
their
balls
bowling
is
the
lay
for
me
said
he
you
get
money
for
that
and
you
only
bruise
the
gents
a
bit
and
break
their
thumbs
you
ca
put
their
vital
sparks
out
as
you
can
at
this
by
a
striking
coincidence
the
most
influential
member
of
the
cricket
club
passed
while
dick
was
in
this
quandary
oh
halfred
you
was
always
very
good
to
me
on
the
ground
you
could
have
me
hired
by
the
club
could
ye
for
i
am
sick
of
this
trade
i
wants
to
you
little
duffer
said
alfred
cricket
is
a
recreation
not
a
business
besides
it
only
lasts
five
months
unless
you
adjourn
to
the
anitipodes
stick
to
the
shop
like
a
man
and
make
your
oh
halfred
said
dick
sorrowfully
how
can
i
find
fortune
here
jenner
do
pay
and
the
crowner
declares
he
will
not
have
it
and
the
barton
says
us
young
gents
ought
all
to
be
given
a
holiday
to
go
and
see
one
of
us
hanged
by
lot
but
this
is
what
have
broke
this
camel
back
at
last
here
a
dalled
thing
to
come
smiling
and
smirking
in
with
and
put
it
across
a
counter
in
a
poor
boy
hand
oh
oh
oh
dick
said
alfred
if
you
blubber
i
give
you
a
hiding
you
have
stumbled
on
a
passage
you
ca
construe
well
who
has
not
but
we
do
shed
the
briny
about
it
here
let
me
have
a
go
at
ah
i
heard
you
are
a
scholard
said
dick
but
you
wo
make
out
this
there
some
new
preparation
of
mercury
and
there
musk
and
there
horehound
and
there
a
neutral
salt
and
dal
his
old

jaw
and
listen
while
i
construe
it
to
you
mercurii
on
wednesday
hora
vespertina
at
ten
at
night
in
musca
what

latin
with
a
vengeance
him
go
in
a
fly
to
the
let
him
jump
tredecim
caniculis
with
thirteen
little
dogs
meo
especially
with
my
little
dog
dicky
this
prescription
emanates
from
bedlam
direct
hallo
it
is
a
woman
then
go
in
a
fly
to
the
eh
jump
no
dance
with
thirteen
whelps
especially
mine
ha
ha
ha
and
who
is
the
woman
that
is
to
do
all
this
i
wonder
woman
indeed
said
a
treble
at
the
door
no
more
than
i
am
it
for
a
young
lady
o
jiminy
this
polite
ejaculation
was
drawn
out
by
the
speaker
sudden
recognition
of
alfred
who
had
raised
his
head
at
her
remonstrance
and
now
started
in
his
turn
for
it
was
the
servant
of
albion
villa
they
looked
at
one
another
in
expressive
silence
yes
sir
it
is
for
my
young
lady
is
it
ready
young
man
no
it
ai
and
never
will
squealed
dick
angrily
it
a
vile
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
bringing
it
into
a
respectable
alfred
silenced
him
and
told
sarah
he
thought
miss
dodd
ought
to
know
the
nature
of
this
prescription
before
it
went
round
the
chemists
he
borrowed
paper
of
dick
and
wrote
mr
alfred
hardie
presents
his
compliments
to
miss
dodd
and
begs
leave
to
inform
her
that
he
has
by
the
merest
accident
intercepted
the
enclosed
prescription
as
it
seems
rather
a
sorry
jest
and
tends
to
attract
attention
to
miss
dodd
and
her
movements
he
has
ventured
with
some
misgivings
to
send
it
back
with
a
literal
translation
on
reading
which
it
will
be
for
miss
dodd
to
decide
whether
it
is
to
circulate
wednesday
at
ten
let
her
go
in
a
fly
to
the
and
dance
with
thirteen
little
little
dogs
puppies
whelps
especially
with
mine
return
home
at
six
and
sleep
till
dinner
and
repeat
the
folly
as
occasion
serves
suppose
i
could
get
it
into
miss
hands
when
she
alone
whispered
sarah
you
would
earn
my
warmest
gratitude
is
that
a
warm
gownd
or
a
warm
clock
i
wonder
it
is
both
when
the
man
is
a
gentleman
and
a
pretty
girl
pities
him
and
stands
his
sarah
smiled
and
whispered
give
it
me
i
do
my
alfred
enclosed
the
prescription
and
his
note
in
one
cover
handed
them
to
her
and
slipped
a
sovereign
into
her
hand
he
whispered
be
i
dark
sir
said
she
and
went
off
briskly
homewards
and
alfred
stood
rapt
in
dreamy
joy
and
so
that
had
he
been
furnished
like
a
peacock
he
would
have
instantly
become
a
thing
all
eyes
and
choked
up
jenner
shop
and
swept
his
counter
he
had
made
a
step
towards
familiarity
had
written
her
a
letter
and
then
if
this
prescription
came
as
he
suspected
from
sampson
she
would
perhaps
be
at
the
ball
this
opened
a
delightful
vista
meantime
dodd
had
communicated
sampson
opinion
to
julia
adding
that
there
was
a
prescription
besides
gone
to
be
made
up
however
he
insists
on
your
going
to
this
julia
begged
hard
to
be
excused
said
she
was
in
no
humour
for
balls
and
dodd
objecting
that
the
tickets
had
actually
been
purchased
she
asked
leave
to
send
them
to
the
dartons
they
will
be
a
treat
to
rose
and
alice
they
seldom
go
out
mamma
i
do
so
fear
they
are
poorer
than
people
think
may
i
it
would
be
but
kind
said
dodd
though
really
why
my
child
should
always
be
sacrificed
to
other
people
children
oh
a
mighty
sacrifice
said
julia
she
sat
down
and
enclosed
the
tickets
to
rose
darton
with
a
little
sugared
note
sarah
being
out
elizabeth
took
it
sarah
met
her
at
the
gate
but
did
not
announce
her
return
she
lurked
in
ambush
till
julia
happened
to
go
to
her
own
room
then
followed
her
and
handed
alfred
missive
and
watched
her
slily
and
being
herself
expeditious
as
the
wind
in
matters
of
the
heart
took
it
for
granted
the
enclosure
was
something
very
warm
indeed
so
she
said
with
feigned
simplicity
i
suppose
it
is
all
right
now
miss
and
retreated
swelling
with
a
secret
and
tormented
her
all
day
with
innuendoes
dark
as
erebus
julia
read
the
note
again
and
again
her
heart
beat
at
those
few
ceremonious
lines
he
does
not
like
me
to
be
talked
of
she
said
to
herself
how
good
he
is
what
trouble
he
takes
about
me
ah
will
be
there
she
divined
rightly
on
wednesday
at
ten
alfred
hardie
was
in
the
it
was
a
magnificent
room
well
lighted
and
at
present
not
half
filled
though
dancing
had
commenced
the
figure
alfred
sought
was
not
there
and
he
wondered
he
had
been
so
childish
as
to
hope
she
would
come
to
a
city
ball
he
played
the
fine
gentleman
would
not
dance
he
got
near
the
door
with
another
oxonian
and
tried
to
avenge
himself
for
her
absence
on
the
townspeople
who
were
there
by
quizzing
them
but
in
the
middle
of
this
amiable
occupation
and
indeed
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
he
stopped
short
and
his
heart
throbbed
and
he
thrilled
from
head
to
foot
for
two
ladies
glided
in
at
the
door
and
passed
up
the
room
with
the
unpretending
composure
of
people
they
were
equally
remarkable
but
alfred
saw
only
the
radiant
young
creature
in
flowing
muslin
with
the
narrowest
sash
in
the
room
and
no
ornament
but
a
necklace
of
large
pearls
and
her
own
vivid
beauty
she
had
altered
her
mind
about
coming
with
apologies
for
her
vacillating
disposition
so
penitent
and
disproportionate
that
her
indulgent
and
unsuspecting
mother
was
really
quite
amused
alfred
was
not
so
happy
as
to
know
that
she
had
changed
her
mind
with
his
note
perhaps
even
this
knowledge
could
have
added
little
to
that
exquisite
moment
when
unhoped
for
she
passed
close
to
him
and
the
fragrant
air
from
her
brushed
his
cheek
and
seemed
to
whisper
follow
me
and
be
my
chapter
v
he
did
follow
her
and
convinced
that
she
would
be
engaged
ten
deep
in
five
minutes
hustled
up
to
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
begged
an
introduction
the
great
banker
son
was
attended
to
at
once
julia
saw
them
coming
as
her
sex
can
see
without
looking
her
eyes
were
on
fire
and
a
delicious
blush
on
her
cheeks
when
the
introduced
alfred
hardie
with
due
pomp
he
asked
her
to
dance
i
am
engaged
for
this
dance
sir
said
she
softly
the
next
asked
hardie
timidly
with
but
when
they
had
got
so
far
they
were
both
seized
with
bashful
silence
and
just
as
alfred
was
going
to
try
and
break
it
cornet
bosanquet
aged
height
feet
inches
strutted
up
with
clanking
heel
and
glancing
haughtily
up
at
him
carried
julia
off
like
a
towing
away
some
fair
schooner
to
these
little
thorns
society
treats
all
anxious
lovers
but
the
incident
was
new
to
alfred
and
discomposed
him
and
besides
he
had
nosed
a
rival
in
sampson
prescription
so
now
he
thought
to
himself
that
little
ensign
is
puppy
to
get
rid
of
dodd
he
offered
to
conduct
her
to
a
seat
she
thanked
him
she
would
rather
stand
where
she
could
see
her
daughter
dance
on
this
he
took
her
to
the
embrasure
of
a
window
opposite
where
julia
and
her
partner
stood
and
they
entered
a
circle
of
spectators
the
band
struck
up
and
the
solemn
skating
began
who
is
this
lovely
creature
in
white
asked
a
solicitor
in
white
i
did
not
see
any
beauty
in
white
replied
his
daughter
why
there
before
your
eyes
said
the
gentleman
loudly
what
that
girl
dancing
with
the
little
captain
i
do
see
much
beauty
in
her
what
a
rubbishing
it
never
cost
a
pound
making
and
all
suggested
another
barkingtonian
nymph
but
what
splendid
pearls
said
a
third
can
they
be
real
real
what
an
idea
ejaculated
a
fourth
who
puts
on
real
pearls
as
big
as
peas
with
muslin
at
twenty
pence
the
yard
weasels
muttered
alfred
and
quivered
all
over
and
he
felt
to
dodd
so
like
a
savage
going
to
spring
that
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
wrist
and
said
gently
but
with
authority
be
calm
sir
and
oblige
me
by
not
noticing
these
then
they
threw
dirt
on
her
bouquet
and
then
on
her
shoes
while
she
was
winding
in
and
out
before
their
eyes
a
grace
and
her
soft
muslin
drifting
and
flowing
like
an
appropriate
cloud
round
a
young
goddess
a
little
starch
would
make
it
set
out
better
it
as
limp
as
a
towel
on
the
i
be
sworn
it
was
washed
at
where
it
was
i
call
it
a
rag
not
a
do
let
us
move
whispered
alfred
i
am
very
comfortable
here
whispered
dodd
how
can
these
things
annoy
my
ears
while
i
have
eyes
look
at
her
she
is
the
lady
in
the
room
her
muslin
is
indian
and
of
a
quality
unknown
to
these
provincial
shopkeepers
a
rajah
gave
it
us
her
pearls
were
my
mother
and
have
been
in
every
court
in
europe
and
she
herself
is
beautiful
would
be
beautiful
dressed
like
the
dowdies
who
are
criticising
her
and
i
think
sir
she
dances
as
well
as
any
lady
can
encumbered
with
an
atom
that
does
not
know
the
all
this
with
the
utmost
placidity
then
as
if
to
extinguish
all
doubt
julia
flung
them
a
heavenly
smile
she
had
been
furtively
watching
them
all
the
time
and
she
saw
they
were
talking
about
her
the
other
oxonian
squeezed
up
to
hardie
do
you
know
the
beauty
she
smiled
your
way
ah
said
hardie
deliberately
you
mean
that
young
lady
with
the
court
pearls
in
that
exquisite
indian
muslin
which
floats
so
gracefully
while
the
other
muslin
girls
are
all
crimp
and
stiff
like
little
pigs
clad
in
ha
ha
ha
yes
introduce
i
could
not
take
such
a
liberty
with
the
queen
of
the
dodd
smiled
but
felt
nervous
and
ill
at
ease
she
thought
to
herself
now
here
is
a
generous
impetuous
as
for
the
hostile
party
staggered
at
first
by
the
masculine
insolence
of
young
hardy
it
soon
recovered
and
true
to
its
sex
attacked
him
obliquely
through
his
white
ladye
who
the
beauty
of
the
ball
asked
one
haughtily
i
do
know
but
not
that
mawkish
thing
in
limp
i
should
say
miss
hetherington
is
the
belle
suggested
a
third
which
is
miss
hetherington
asked
the
oxonian
coolly
of
alfred
oh
she
wo
do
for
us
it
is
that
little
girl
dressed
in
pink
with
red
roses
the
pink
of
vulgarity
and
bad
at
this
both
oxonians
laughed
arrogantly
and
dodd
withdrew
her
hand
from
the
speaker
arm
and
glided
away
behind
the
throng
julia
looked
at
him
with
marked
anxiety
he
returned
her
look
and
was
sore
puzzled
what
it
meant
till
he
found
dodd
had
withdrawn
softly
from
him
then
he
stood
confused
regretting
too
late
he
had
not
obeyed
her
positive
request
and
tried
to
imitate
her
dignified
forbearance
the
quadrille
ended
he
instantly
stepped
forward
and
bowing
politely
to
the
cornet
said
authoritatively
mrs
dodd
sends
me
to
conduct
you
to
her
with
your
permission
his
arm
was
offered
and
taken
before
the
little
warrior
knew
where
he
was
he
had
her
on
his
arm
soft
light
and
fragrant
as
zephyr
and
her
cool
breath
wooing
his
neck
oh
the
thrill
of
that
moment
but
her
first
word
was
to
ask
him
with
considerable
anxiety
why
did
mamma
leave
you
miss
dodd
i
am
the
most
unhappy
of
no
doubt
no
doubt
said
she
a
little
crossly
she
added
with
one
of
her
gushes
of
naivete
and
i
shall
be
unhappy
too
if
you
go
and
displease
what
could
i
do
a
gang
of
snobbesses
were
detracting
from
somebody
to
speak
plainly
they
were
running
down
the
loveliest
of
her
sex
your
mamma
told
me
to
keep
quiet
and
so
i
did
till
i
got
a
fair
chance
and
then
i
gave
it
them
in
their
he
ground
his
own
and
added
i
think
i
was
very
good
not
to
kick
julia
coloured
with
pleasure
and
proceeded
to
turn
it
off
oh
most
forbearing
and
considerate
said
she
ah
by
the
way
i
think
i
did
hear
some
ladies
express
a
misgiving
as
to
the
pecuniary
value
of
my
costume
ha
ha
oh
you
foolish
fancy
noticing
that
why
it
is
in
little
sneers
that
the
approval
of
the
ladies
shows
itself
at
a
ball
and
it
is
a
much
sincerer
compliment
than
the
gentlemen
bombastical
praises
fairest
of
her
sex
and
so
on
that
none
but
the
of
her
sex
miss
dodd
i
never
said
the
fairest
of
her
sex
i
said
the
oh
that
alters
the
case
entirely
said
julia
whose
spirits
were
mounting
with
the
lights
and
music
and
alfred
company
so
now
come
and
be
reconciled
to
the
best
and
wisest
of
her
sex
ay
and
the
beautifullest
if
you
but
knew
her
sweet
dear
darling
face
as
i
do
there
she
is
let
us
mamma
here
is
a
penitent
for
you
real
or
feigned
i
do
know
real
dodd
said
alfred
i
had
no
right
to
disobey
you
and
risk
a
scene
you
served
me
right
by
abandoning
me
i
feel
the
rebuke
and
its
justice
let
me
hope
your
vengeance
will
go
no
dodd
smiled
at
the
grandiloquence
of
youth
and
told
him
he
had
mistaken
her
character
i
saw
i
had
acquired
a
generous
ally
who
was
bent
on
doing
battle
with
insects
so
i
withdrew
but
so
i
should
at
waterloo
or
anywhere
else
where
people
put
themselves
in
a
the
band
struck
up
again
ah
said
julia
and
i
promised
you
this
dance
but
it
is
a
waltz
and
my
guardian
angel
objects
to
the
a
deux
decidedly
should
all
the
mothers
in
england
permit
their
daughters
to
romp
and
wrestle
in
public
and
call
it
waltzing
i
must
stand
firm
till
they
return
to
their
julia
looked
at
alfred
despondently
he
took
his
cue
and
said
with
a
smile
well
perhaps
it
is
a
little
rompy
a
donkey
gallop
and
then
twirl
her
like
a
since
you
admit
that
perhaps
you
can
waltz
properly
said
dodd
alfred
said
he
ought
he
had
given
his
whole
soul
to
it
in
germany
last
long
then
i
can
have
the
pleasure
of
dropping
the
tyrant
away
with
you
both
while
there
is
room
to
alfred
took
his
partner
delicately
they
made
just
two
catlike
steps
forward
and
melted
into
the
waltz
it
was
an
exquisite
moment
to
most
young
people
love
comes
after
a
great
deal
of
waltzing
but
this
pair
brought
the
awakened
tenderness
and
trembling
sensibilities
of
two
burning
hearts
to
this
their
first
intoxicating
whirl
to
them
therefore
everything
was
an
event
everything
was
a
thrill
the
first
meeting
and
timid
pressure
of
their
hands
the
first
delicate
enfolding
of
her
supple
waist
by
his
strong
arm
but
trembling
hand
the
delightful
unison
of
their
unerring
feet
the
movement
the
music
the
soft
delicious
whirl
her
cool
breath
saluting
his
neck
his
ardent
but
now
liquid
eyes
seeking
hers
tenderly
and
drinking
them
deep
hers
that
now
and
then
sipped
his
so
sweetly
all
these
were
new
and
separate
joys
that
linked
themselves
in
one
soft
delirium
of
bliss
it
was
not
a
waltz
it
was
an
ecstasy
starting
almost
alone
this
peerless
pair
danced
a
gauntlet
on
each
side
admiration
and
detraction
buzzed
all
the
time
beautiful
they
are
turning
in
the
quite
gone
by
that
how
the
old
fogies
chorus
of
shallow
males
how
well
she
chorus
of
shallow
females
how
well
he
but
they
noted
neither
praise
nor
detraction
they
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
felt
nothing
but
themselves
and
the
other
music
till
two
valsers
deux
plunged
into
them
thus
smartly
reminded
they
had
not
earth
all
to
themselves
they
laughed
and
paused
ah
i
am
happy
gushed
from
julia
she
hushed
at
herself
and
said
severely
you
dance
very
well
this
was
said
to
justify
her
unguarded
admission
and
did
after
a
fashion
i
think
it
is
time
to
go
to
mamma
said
she
demurely
so
soon
and
i
had
so
much
to
say
to
oh
very
well
i
am
all
the
sudden
facility
offered
set
alfred
stammering
a
little
i
wanted
to
apologise
to
you
for
something
you
are
so
good
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
it
but
i
dare
not
hope
that
i
mean
at
henley
when
the
beauty
of
your
character
and
your
goodness
so
overpowered
me
that
a
fatal
impulse
what
do
you
mean
sir
said
julia
looking
him
full
in
the
face
like
an
offended
lion
while
with
true
feminine
and
julian
inconsistency
her
bosom
fluttered
like
a
dove
i
never
exchanged
one
word
with
you
in
my
life
before
and
i
never
shall
again
if
you
pretend
the
alfred
stood
stupified
and
looked
at
her
in
piteous
amazement
i
value
your
acquaintance
highly
hardie
now
i
have
made
it
as
acquaintances
are
made
but
please
to
observe
i
never
saw
you
before
scarcely
not
even
in
as
you
please
said
he
recovering
his
wits
in
part
what
you
say
i
swear
then
i
say
never
remind
a
lady
of
what
you
ought
to
wish
her
to
i
was
a
fool
and
you
are
an
angel
of
tact
and
oh
now
i
am
sure
it
is
time
to
join
mamma
said
she
in
the
driest
drollest
way
they
waltzed
down
to
dodd
exchanging
hearts
at
every
turn
and
they
took
a
good
many
in
the
space
of
a
round
table
for
in
truth
both
were
equally
loth
to
part
at
two
dodd
resumed
views
of
a
health
and
rose
to
go
her
fly
had
played
her
false
and
being
our
island
home
it
rained
buckets
alfred
ran
before
they
could
stop
him
and
caught
a
fly
he
was
dripping
dodd
expressed
her
regrets
he
told
her
it
did
not
matter
for
him
the
ball
was
now
over
the
flowers
faded
and
the
lights
darkness
visible
the
extravagance
of
these
children
said
dodd
to
julia
with
a
smile
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
hearing
julia
made
no
reply
next
day
she
was
at
evening
church
the
congregation
was
very
sparse
the
first
glance
revealed
alfred
hardie
standing
in
the
very
next
pew
he
wore
a
calm
front
of
conscious
rectitude
under
which
peeped
misgivings
as
to
the
result
of
this
advance
for
like
all
true
lovers
he
was
half
impudence
half
timidity
and
both
on
the
grand
scale
now
julia
in
a
was
one
creature
another
in
church
after
the
first
surprise
which
sent
the
blood
for
a
moment
to
her
cheek
she
found
he
had
come
without
a
she
looked
sadly
and
half
reproachfully
at
him
then
put
her
white
hand
calmly
over
the
wooden
partition
and
made
him
read
with
her
out
of
her
book
she
shared
her
with
him
too
and
sang
her
maker
praise
modestly
and
soberly
but
earnestly
and
quite
undisturbed
by
her
lover
presence
it
seemed
as
if
this
pure
creature
was
drawing
him
to
heaven
holding
by
that
good
book
and
by
her
touching
voice
he
felt
good
all
over
to
be
like
her
he
tried
to
bend
his
whole
mind
on
the
prayers
of
the
church
and
for
the
first
time
realised
how
beautiful
they
are
after
service
he
followed
her
to
the
door
island
home
again
by
the
pailful
and
she
had
a
thick
shawl
but
no
umbrella
he
had
brought
a
large
one
on
the
chance
he
would
see
her
home
quite
unnecessary
it
is
so
he
insisted
she
persisted
and
persisting
yielded
they
said
but
little
yet
they
seemed
to
interchange
volumes
and
at
each
gaslight
they
passed
they
stole
a
look
and
treasured
it
to
feed
on
that
night
was
one
broad
step
more
towards
the
great
happiness
or
great
misery
which
awaits
a
noble
love
such
loves
somewhat
rare
in
nature
have
lately
become
so
very
rare
in
fiction
that
i
have
ventured
with
many
misgivings
to
detail
the
peculiarities
of
its
rise
and
progress
but
now
for
a
time
it
advanced
on
beaten
tracks
alfred
had
the
right
to
call
at
albion
villa
and
he
came
twice
once
when
dodd
was
out
this
was
the
time
he
stayed
the
two
hours
a
james
invited
jane
and
him
to
tea
and
exposition
there
he
met
julia
and
edward
who
had
just
returned
edward
was
taken
with
jane
hardie
face
and
dovelike
eyes
eyes
that
dwelt
with
a
soft
and
chastened
admiration
on
his
masculine
face
and
his
model
form
and
their
owner
felt
she
had
received
a
call
to
watch
over
his
spiritual
weal
so
they
paired
off
julia
fluctuating
spirits
settled
now
into
a
calm
demure
complacency
her
mother
finding
this
strange
remedial
virtue
in
youthful
society
gave
young
parties
inviting
jane
and
alfred
in
their
turn
jane
hesitated
but
as
she
could
no
longer
keep
julia
from
knowing
her
worldly
brother
and
hoped
a
way
might
be
opened
for
her
to
rescue
edward
she
relaxed
her
general
rule
which
was
to
go
into
no
company
unless
some
religious
service
formed
part
of
the
entertainment
yet
her
conscience
was
ill
at
ease
and
to
set
them
an
example
she
took
care
when
she
asked
the
dodds
in
return
to
have
a
clergyman
there
of
her
own
party
who
could
pray
and
expound
with
unction
dodd
not
to
throw
cold
water
on
what
seemed
to
gratify
her
children
accepted
miss
hardie
invitation
but
she
never
intended
to
go
and
at
the
last
moment
wrote
to
say
she
was
slightly
indisposed
the
nature
of
her
she
revealed
to
julia
alone
that
young
lady
keeps
me
on
thorns
i
never
feel
secure
she
will
not
say
or
do
something
extravagant
or
unusual
she
seems
to
suspect
sobriety
and
good
taste
of
being
in
league
with
impiety
here
i
succeed
in
bridling
her
a
little
but
encounter
a
female
enthusiast
in
her
own
house
after
all
there
must
be
something
good
in
her
since
she
is
your
friend
and
you
are
hers
but
i
have
something
more
serious
to
say
before
you
go
there
it
is
about
her
brother
he
is
a
flirt
in
fact
a
notorious
one
more
than
one
lady
tells
julia
was
silent
but
began
to
be
very
uneasy
they
were
sitting
and
talking
after
sunset
yet
without
candles
she
profited
for
once
by
that
prodigious
gap
in
the
intelligence
of
the
i
hear
he
pays
you
compliments
and
i
have
seen
a
disposition
to
single
you
out
now
my
love
you
have
the
good
sense
to
know
that
whatever
a
young
gentleman
of
that
age
says
to
you
he
says
to
many
other
ladies
but
your
experience
is
not
equal
to
your
sense
so
profit
by
mine
a
girl
of
your
age
must
never
be
talked
of
with
a
person
of
the
other
sex
it
is
fatal
fatal
but
if
you
permit
yourself
to
be
singled
out
you
will
be
talked
of
and
distress
those
who
love
you
it
is
easy
to
avoid
injudicious
duets
in
society
oblige
me
by
doing
so
to
show
how
much
she
was
in
earnest
dodd
hinted
that
were
her
admonition
neglected
she
should
regret
for
once
having
kept
clear
of
an
enthusiast
julia
had
no
alternative
she
assented
in
a
faint
voice
after
a
pause
she
faltered
out
and
suppose
he
should
esteem
me
seriously
dodd
replied
quickly
then
that
would
be
much
worse
but
said
she
i
have
no
apprehensions
on
that
score
you
are
a
child
and
he
is
a
precocious
boy
and
rather
a
flirt
but
forewarned
is
forearmed
so
now
run
away
and
dress
sweet
one
my
lecture
is
quite
the
sensitive
girl
went
up
to
her
room
with
a
heavy
heart
all
the
fears
she
had
lulled
of
late
revived
she
saw
plainly
now
that
dodd
only
accepted
alfred
as
a
pleasant
acquaintance
as
a
he
was
out
of
the
question
oh
what
will
she
say
when
she
knows
all
thought
julia
next
day
sitting
near
the
window
she
saw
him
coming
up
the
road
after
the
first
movement
of
pleasure
at
the
bare
sight
of
him
she
was
sorry
he
had
come
mamma
suspicions
awake
at
last
and
here
he
was
again
the
third
call
in
one
fortnight
she
dared
not
risk
an
interview
with
him
ardent
and
unguarded
under
that
penetrating
eye
which
she
felt
would
now
be
on
the
watch
she
rose
hurriedly
said
as
carelessly
as
she
could
i
am
going
to
the
school
and
tying
her
bonnet
on
all
in
a
flurry
whipped
out
at
the
with
her
shawl
in
her
hand
just
as
sarah
opened
the
front
door
to
alfred
she
then
shuffled
on
her
shawl
and
whisked
through
the
little
shrubbery
into
the
open
field
and
reached
a
path
that
led
to
the
school
and
so
gratified
was
she
at
her
dexterity
in
evading
her
favourite
that
she
hung
her
head
and
went
murmuring
cruel
cruel
cruel
alfred
entered
the
gaily
with
a
card
and
a
prepared
speech
his
was
not
the
visit
of
a
friend
but
a
functionary
the
treasurer
of
the
come
to
book
two
of
his
eighteen
to
play
against
the
eleven
next
month
as
for
you
my
worthy
sir
turning
to
edward
i
shall
just
put
you
down
without
ceremony
but
i
must
ask
leave
to
book
captain
dodd
dodd
i
come
at
the
universal
desire
of
the
club
they
say
it
is
sure
to
be
a
dull
match
without
captain
dodd
besides
he
is
a
capital
mamma
do
you
be
caught
by
his
chaff
said
edward
quietly
papa
is
no
player
at
all
anything
more
unlike
cricket
than
his
way
of
making
runs
but
he
makes
them
old
fellow
now
you
and
i
at
lord
the
other
day
played
in
form
left
shoulder
well
up
and
achieved
with
neatness
precision
dexterity
and
despatch
the
british
misericorde
what
is
that
inquired
dodd
why
a
round
o
said
the
other
oxonian
coming
to
his
friend
aid
and
what
is
that
pray
alfred
told
her
the
round
o
which
had
yielded
to
the
duck
egg
and
was
becoming
obsolete
meant
the
cypher
set
by
the
scorer
against
a
player
name
who
is
out
without
making
a
run
i
see
sighed
dodd
the
jargon
of
the
day
penetrates
to
your
very
sports
and
games
and
why
british
oh
is
redundant
thrown
in
by
the
but
what
does
it
mean
it
means
nothing
that
is
the
beauty
of
it
british
is
inserted
in
imitation
of
our
idols
the
greeks
they
adored
in
short
poor
alfred
though
not
an
was
talking
to
put
off
time
till
julia
should
come
in
so
he
now
favoured
dodd
of
all
people
with
a
flowery
description
of
her
husband
play
which
i
who
have
not
his
motive
for
volubility
suppress
however
he
wound
up
with
the
captains
moral
last
match
said
he
barkington
did
not
do
itself
justice
several
that
could
have
made
a
stand
were
frightened
out
rather
than
bowled
by
the
london
professionals
then
captain
dodd
went
in
and
treated
those
artists
with
the
same
contempt
he
would
a
parish
bowler
and
in
particular
sent
mynne
balls
flying
over
his
head
for
five
or
to
square
leg
for
four
and
on
his
retiring
with
scored
in
eight
minutes
the
remaining
barkingtonians
were
less
funky
and
made
some
fair
dodd
smiled
a
little
ironically
at
this
tirade
but
said
she
thought
she
might
venture
to
promise
dodd
should
he
reach
home
in
time
then
to
get
rid
of
alfred
before
julia
return
the
amiable
worldling
turned
to
edward
your
sister
will
not
be
back
so
you
may
as
well
ring
the
bell
for
luncheon
at
once
perhaps
hardie
will
join
alfred
declined
and
took
his
leave
with
far
less
alacrity
than
he
had
entered
edward
went
with
him
miss
dodd
gone
on
a
visit
asked
alfred
affecting
carelessness
only
to
the
school
i
will
go
and
fetch
no
do
do
that
call
on
my
sister
instead
and
then
you
will
pull
me
out
of
a
scrape
i
promised
to
bring
her
here
but
her
saintship
was
so
long
adorning
poor
perishable
body
that
i
came
i
do
understand
you
said
edward
i
am
not
the
attraction
here
it
is
how
do
you
know
that
when
a
young
lady
interests
herself
in
an
undergraduate
soul
it
is
a
pretty
sure
sign
she
likes
the
looks
of
him
but
perhaps
you
do
want
to
be
converted
if
so
keep
clear
of
the
fell
dragon
blighting
way
but
shun
that
lovely
snare
on
the
contrary
said
edward
calmly
i
only
wish
she
could
make
me
as
good
as
she
is
or
half
as
give
her
the
chance
old
fellow
and
then
it
wo
be
your
fault
if
she
makes
a
mess
of
it
call
at
two
and
jenny
will
receive
you
very
kindly
and
will
show
you
you
are
in
the
of
bitterness
and
the
bond
of
iniquity
now
wo
that
be
nice
i
will
go
said
edward
gravely
they
parted
where
alfred
went
the
reader
can
perhaps
guess
edward
to
luncheon
mamma
said
he
with
that
tranquillity
which
sat
so
well
on
him
do
you
think
alfred
hardie
is
spoony
upon
our
julia
dodd
suppressed
a
start
and
perhaps
to
gain
time
before
replying
sincerely
said
she
had
not
the
honour
of
knowing
what
spoony
meant
why
sighs
for
her
and
dies
for
her
and
fancies
she
is
prettier
than
miss
hardie
he
must
be
over
head
and
ears
to
think
fie
child
was
the
answer
if
i
thought
so
i
should
withdraw
from
their
acquaintance
excuse
me
i
must
put
on
my
bonnet
at
once
not
to
lose
this
fine
edward
did
not
relish
her
remark
it
menaced
more
spoons
than
one
however
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
cast
down
at
a
word
he
lighted
a
cigar
and
strolled
towards
hardie
house
hardie
senior
had
left
three
days
ago
on
a
visit
to
london
miss
hardie
received
him
he
passed
the
afternoon
in
calm
complacency
listening
reverently
to
her
admonitions
and
looking
her
softly
out
of
countenance
and
into
earthly
affections
with
his
lion
eyes
meantime
his
remark
so
far
from
really
seeming
foolish
to
dodd
was
the
true
reason
for
her
leaving
him
so
abruptly
even
this
dear
slow
thing
sees
it
thought
she
she
must
talk
to
julia
more
seriously
and
would
go
to
the
school
at
once
she
went
and
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
before
the
glass
then
moulded
on
her
gloves
and
came
down
equipped
on
the
stairs
was
a
large
window
looking
upon
the
open
field
she
naturally
cast
her
eyes
through
it
in
the
direction
she
was
going
and
what
did
she
see
but
a
young
lady
and
gentleman
coming
slowly
down
the
path
towards
the
villa
dodd
bit
her
lip
with
vexation
and
looked
keenly
at
them
to
divine
on
what
terms
they
were
and
the
more
she
looked
the
more
uneasy
she
grew
the
head
the
hand
the
whole
body
of
a
sensitive
young
woman
walking
beside
him
she
loves
betray
her
heart
to
experienced
eyes
watching
unseen
and
especially
to
female
eyes
and
why
did
julia
move
so
slowly
especially
after
that
warning
why
was
her
head
averted
from
that
encroaching
boy
and
herself
so
near
him
why
not
keep
her
distance
and
look
him
full
in
the
face
dodd
first
impulse
was
that
of
leopardesses
lionesses
hens
and
all
the
mothers
in
nature
to
dart
from
her
ambush
and
protect
her
young
but
she
controlled
it
by
a
strong
effort
it
seemed
wiser
to
descry
the
truth
and
then
act
with
resolution
besides
the
young
people
were
now
almost
at
the
shrubbery
so
the
mischief
if
any
was
done
they
entered
the
shrubbery
to
dodd
surprise
and
dismay
they
did
not
come
out
this
side
so
quickly
she
darted
her
eye
into
the
plantation
and
lo
alfred
had
seized
the
fatal
opportunity
foliage
offers
even
when
thinnish
he
held
julia
hand
and
was
pleading
eagerly
for
something
she
seemed
not
disposed
to
grant
for
she
turned
away
and
made
an
effort
to
leave
him
but
dodd
standing
there
quivering
with
maternal
anxiety
and
hot
with
shame
could
not
but
doubt
the
sincerity
of
that
graceful
resistance
if
she
had
been
quite
in
earnest
julia
had
fire
enough
in
her
to
box
the
little
wretch
ears
she
ceased
even
to
doubt
when
she
saw
that
her
daughter
opposition
ended
in
his
getting
hold
of
two
hands
instead
of
one
and
devouring
them
with
kisses
while
julia
still
drew
her
head
and
neck
away
but
the
rest
of
her
supple
frame
seemed
to
yield
and
incline
and
draw
softly
towards
her
besieger
by
some
irresistible
spell
i
can
bear
no
more
gasped
dodd
aloud
and
turned
to
hasten
and
part
them
but
even
as
she
curved
her
stately
neck
to
go
she
caught
the
lovers
parting
and
a
very
pretty
one
too
if
she
could
but
have
looked
at
it
as
these
things
ought
always
to
be
looked
at
artistically
julia
head
and
lovely
throat
unable
to
draw
the
rest
of
her
away
compromised
they
turned
declined
drooped
and
rested
one
half
moment
on
her
captor
shoulder
like
a
settling
dove
the
next
she
scudded
from
him
and
made
for
the
house
alone
dodd
deeply
indignant
but
too
wise
to
court
a
painful
interview
with
her
own
heart
beating
high
went
into
the
and
there
sat
down
to
recover
some
little
composure
but
she
was
hardly
seated
when
julia
innocent
voice
was
heard
calling
mamma
mamma
and
soon
she
came
bounding
into
the
brimful
of
good
news
her
cheeks
as
red
as
fire
and
her
eyes
wet
with
happy
tears
and
there
confronted
her
mother
who
had
started
up
at
her
footstep
and
now
with
one
hand
nipping
the
back
of
the
chair
convulsively
stood
lofty
looking
strangely
agitated
and
hostile
the
two
ladies
eyed
one
another
silent
yet
expressive
like
a
picture
facing
a
statue
but
soon
the
colour
died
out
of
julia
face
as
well
and
she
began
to
cower
with
vague
fears
before
that
stately
figure
so
gentle
and
placid
usually
but
now
so
discomposed
and
stern
where
have
you
been
julia
only
at
the
school
she
faltered
who
was
your
companion
home
oh
do
be
angry
with
me
it
was
alfred
his
christian
name
you
try
my
patience
too
forgive
me
i
was
not
to
blame
this
time
indeed
indeed
you
frighten
me
what
will
become
of
me
what
have
i
done
for
my
own
mamma
to
look
at
me
so
dodd
groaned
was
that
young
coquette
i
watched
from
my
window
the
child
i
have
reared
no
face
on
earth
is
to
be
trusted
after
this
have
you
done
indeed
only
risked
your
own
mother
esteem
and
nearly
broken
her
heart
and
with
these
words
her
own
courage
began
to
give
way
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
with
a
deep
sigh
at
this
julia
screamed
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
beside
her
and
cried
kill
me
oh
pray
kill
me
but
do
drive
me
to
despair
with
such
cruel
words
and
looks
and
fell
to
sobbing
so
wildly
that
dodd
altered
her
tone
with
almost
ludicrous
rapidity
there
do
not
terrify
me
with
your
impetuosity
after
grieving
me
so
be
calm
child
let
me
see
whether
i
can
not
remedy
your
sad
imprudence
and
that
i
may
pray
tell
me
the
whole
truth
how
did
this
come
about
in
reply
to
this
question
which
she
somewhat
mistook
julia
sobbed
out
he
met
me
out
of
the
school
and
asked
to
me
home
i
said
thank
you
because
i
of
your
warning
yes
said
he
and
walk
with
me
and
keep
saying
he
loved
me
so
to
stop
him
i
said
but
i
was
and
had
no
time
to
flirt
have
i
the
said
he
is
not
what
others
say
of
you
said
i
you
know
what
you
me
mamma
so
at
last
he
said
ever
he
ask
any
lady
to
be
his
wife
suppose
not
said
i
you
would
be
property
by
now
instead
of
now
there
was
a
foolish
speech
as
much
as
to
say
nobody
could
resist
it
and
more
they
could
you
have
no
idea
how
he
makes
love
unladylike
keeps
advancing
and
advancing
and
never
once
retreats
nor
even
i
ask
to
be
my
wife
said
he
oh
mamma
i
trembled
so
why
did
i
tremble
i
do
know
i
made
myself
cold
and
haughty
should
make
no
reply
to
such
ridiculous
questions
say
that
to
mamma
if
you
dare
i
dodd
bit
her
lip
and
said
was
there
ever
such
simplicity
simple
why
that
was
my
cunning
you
are
the
only
creature
he
is
afraid
of
so
i
thought
to
stop
his
mouth
with
you
but
instead
of
that
my
lord
said
calmly
was
understood
he
loved
me
too
well
to
steal
me
from
her
to
whom
he
was
indebted
for
me
oh
he
has
always
an
answer
ready
and
that
makes
him
such
a
it
was
an
answer
that
did
him
dear
mamma
now
did
it
not
then
at
parting
he
said
he
would
come
and
ask
you
for
my
hand
but
i
must
intercede
with
you
first
or
you
would
be
sure
to
say
so
i
declined
to
interfere
was
it
to
me
i
said
he
begged
and
prayed
me
it
likely
you
would
give
him
such
a
treasure
as
me
unless
i
stood
his
friend
for
the
thing
turns
humble
now
and
then
and
oh
mamma
he
did
so
implore
me
to
pity
him
and
kept
saying
no
man
ever
loved
as
he
loved
me
and
with
his
begging
and
praying
me
so
passionately
oh
so
passionately
i
felt
something
warm
drop
from
his
poor
eyes
on
my
hand
oh
oh
oh
oh
what
could
i
do
and
then
you
know
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
him
so
i
am
afraid
i
did
just
say
but
only
in
a
whisper
mamma
my
own
good
kind
darling
mamma
have
pity
on
him
and
on
me
we
love
one
another
a
shower
of
tender
tears
gushed
out
in
support
of
this
appeal
and
in
a
moment
she
was
caught
up
with
love
mighty
arms
and
her
head
laid
on
her
mother
yearning
bosom
no
word
was
needed
to
reconcile
these
two
after
a
long
silence
dodd
said
this
would
be
a
warning
never
to
judge
her
sweet
child
from
a
distance
again
nor
unheard
and
therefore
said
she
let
me
hear
from
your
own
lips
how
so
serious
an
attachment
could
spring
up
why
it
is
scarcely
a
month
since
you
were
first
introduced
at
that
mamma
murmured
julia
hanging
her
head
you
are
mistaken
we
knew
each
other
dodd
looked
all
astonishment
now
i
ease
my
heart
said
julia
impetuously
addressing
some
invisible
obstacle
i
tell
you
i
am
sick
of
having
secrets
from
my
own
and
with
this
out
it
all
came
she
told
the
story
of
her
heart
better
than
i
have
and
dwelt
on
the
depths
of
loyalty
and
delicate
love
she
had
read
in
alfred
moonlit
face
that
night
at
henley
she
said
no
eloquence
could
have
touched
her
like
it
mamma
something
said
to
me
look
at
him
well
for
that
is
your
husband
to
be
she
even
tried
to
solve
the
mystery
of
her
sickness
i
was
disturbed
by
a
feeling
so
new
and
so
powerful
but
above
all
by
having
a
secret
from
you
the
first
the
even
this
faint
attempt
at
was
due
to
the
influence
of
whately
for
by
nature
young
ladies
of
this
age
seldom
turn
the
eye
inward
well
darling
then
why
have
a
secret
why
not
trust
me
your
friend
as
well
as
your
mother
ah
why
indeed
i
am
a
puzzle
to
myself
i
wanted
you
to
know
and
yet
i
could
not
tell
you
i
kept
giving
you
hints
and
hoped
so
you
would
take
them
and
make
me
speak
out
but
when
i
tried
to
tell
you
plump
something
kept
pull
pull
pulling
me
inside
and
i
could
mark
my
words
some
day
it
will
turn
out
that
i
am
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
dodd
slighted
this
ingenious
solution
she
said
after
a
reflection
that
the
fault
of
this
misunderstanding
lay
between
the
two
i
remember
now
i
have
had
many
hints
my
mind
must
surely
have
gone
to
sleep
i
was
a
poor
simple
woman
who
thought
her
daughter
was
to
be
always
a
child
and
you
were
very
wrong
to
go
and
set
a
limit
to
your
mother
love
there
is
none
none
she
added
i
must
import
a
little
prudence
and
respect
for
the
world
opinion
into
this
new
connection
but
whoever
you
love
shall
find
no
enemy
in
next
day
alfred
came
to
know
his
fate
he
was
received
with
ceremonious
courtesy
at
first
he
was
a
good
deal
embarrassed
but
this
was
no
sooner
seen
than
it
was
relieved
by
dodd
with
tact
and
gentleness
when
her
turn
came
she
said
your
papa
of
course
you
have
communicated
this
step
to
him
alfred
looked
a
little
confused
and
said
no
he
left
for
london
two
days
ago
as
it
that
is
unfortunate
said
dodd
your
best
plan
would
be
to
write
to
him
at
once
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
we
shall
enter
no
family
without
an
invitation
from
its
alfred
replied
that
he
was
well
aware
of
that
and
that
he
knew
his
father
and
could
answer
for
him
no
doubt
said
dodd
but
as
a
matter
of
reasonable
form
i
prefer
he
should
answer
for
alfred
would
write
by
this
post
it
is
a
mere
form
said
he
for
my
father
has
but
one
answer
to
his
children
yourselves
he
sometimes
adds
how
much
money
shall
you
want
these
are
his
two
he
then
delivered
a
glowing
eulogy
on
his
father
and
dodd
to
whom
the
boy
character
was
now
a
grave
and
anxious
study
saw
with
no
common
satisfaction
his
cheek
flush
and
his
eyes
moisten
as
he
dwelt
on
the
calm
sober
unvarying
affection
and
reasonable
indulgence
he
and
his
sister
had
met
with
all
their
lives
from
the
best
of
parents
returning
to
the
topic
of
topics
he
proposed
an
engagement
i
have
a
ring
in
my
pocket
said
this
brisk
wooer
looking
down
but
this
dodd
thought
premature
and
unnecessary
you
are
nearly
of
age
said
she
and
then
you
will
be
able
to
marry
if
you
are
in
the
same
but
upon
being
warmly
pressed
she
half
conceded
even
this
well
said
she
on
receiving
your
father
consent
you
can
an
engagement
to
julia
and
she
shall
use
her
own
judgment
but
until
then
you
will
not
even
mention
such
a
thing
to
her
may
i
count
on
so
much
forbearance
from
you
sir
dear
dodd
said
alfred
of
course
you
may
i
should
indeed
be
ungrateful
if
i
could
not
wait
a
post
for
that
may
i
write
to
my
father
here
added
he
naively
dodd
smiled
furnished
him
with
writing
materials
and
left
him
with
a
polite
excuse
albion
villa
my
dear
father
you
are
too
thorough
a
man
of
the
world
and
too
well
versed
in
human
nature
to
be
surprised
at
hearing
that
i
so
long
invulnerable
have
at
last
formed
a
devoted
attachment
to
one
whose
beauty
goodness
and
accomplishments
i
will
not
now
enlarge
upon
they
are
indescribable
and
you
will
very
soon
see
them
and
judge
for
yourself
the
attachment
though
short
in
weeks
and
months
has
been
a
very
long
one
in
hopes
and
fears
and
devotion
i
should
have
told
you
of
it
before
you
left
but
in
truth
i
had
no
idea
i
was
so
near
the
goal
of
all
my
earthly
hopes
there
were
many
difficulties
but
these
have
just
cleared
away
almost
miraculously
and
nothing
now
is
wanting
to
my
happiness
but
your
consent
it
would
be
affectation
or
worse
in
me
to
doubt
that
you
will
grant
it
but
in
a
matter
so
delicate
i
venture
to
ask
you
for
something
more
the
mother
of
my
ever
and
only
beloved
julia
is
a
lady
of
high
breeding
and
sentiments
she
will
not
let
her
daughter
enter
any
family
without
a
cordial
invitation
from
its
head
indeed
she
has
just
told
me
so
i
ask
therefore
not
your
bare
consent
of
which
i
am
sure
since
my
happiness
for
life
depends
on
it
but
a
consent
so
gracefully
worded
and
who
can
do
this
better
than
you
as
to
gratify
the
just
pride
and
sensibilities
of
the
family
about
to
confide
its
brightest
ornament
to
my
care
my
dear
father
in
the
midst
of
felicity
almost
more
than
mortal
the
thought
has
come
that
this
letter
is
my
first
step
towards
leaving
the
paternal
roof
under
which
i
have
been
so
happy
all
my
life
thanks
to
you
i
should
indeed
be
unworthy
of
all
your
goodness
if
this
thought
caused
me
no
emotion
yet
i
do
but
yield
to
nature
universal
law
and
should
i
be
master
of
my
own
destiny
i
will
not
go
far
from
you
i
have
been
unjust
to
barkington
or
rather
i
have
echoed
without
thought
oxonian
prejudices
and
affectation
on
mature
reflection
i
know
no
better
residence
for
a
married
man
do
you
remember
about
a
year
ago
you
mentioned
a
miss
lucy
fountain
to
us
as
most
perfect
gentlewoman
you
had
ever
met
well
strange
to
say
it
is
that
very
lady
daughter
and
i
think
when
you
see
her
you
will
say
the
breed
has
anything
but
declined
in
spite
of
horace
mind
his
quid
non
her
brother
is
my
dearest
friend
and
she
is
jenny
so
a
more
happy
alliance
for
all
parties
was
never
projected
write
to
me
by
return
dear
father
and
believe
me
ever
your
dutiful
and
grateful
son
alfred
as
he
concluded
julia
came
in
and
he
insisted
on
her
reading
this
masterpiece
she
hesitated
then
he
told
her
with
juvenile
severity
that
a
good
husband
always
shares
his
letters
with
his
wife
his
wife
alfred
and
she
coloured
all
over
do
call
me
said
she
turning
it
off
after
her
fashion
i
ca
bear
it
it
makes
me
tremble
with
this
will
never
do
sweet
one
said
alfred
gravely
you
and
i
are
to
have
no
separate
existence
now
you
are
to
be
i
and
i
am
to
be
you
come
no
you
read
me
so
much
of
it
as
is
proper
for
me
to
hear
i
shall
not
like
it
so
well
from
your
lips
but
never
when
he
came
to
read
it
he
appreciated
the
delicacy
that
had
tempered
her
curiosity
he
did
not
read
it
all
to
her
but
nearly
it
is
a
beautiful
letter
said
she
a
little
pomposer
than
mamma
and
i
write
paternal
roof
but
all
that
becomes
you
you
are
a
scholar
and
dear
alfred
if
i
should
separate
you
from
your
papa
i
will
never
estrange
you
from
him
oh
never
never
may
i
go
for
my
work
for
methinks
o
most
erudite
the
dame
on
domestic
cares
intent
hath
confided
to
her
offspring
the
recreation
of
your
the
gay
creature
dropt
him
a
curtsey
and
fled
to
tell
dodd
the
substance
of
the
sweet
letter
the
dear
thing
had
by
then
he
had
folded
and
addressed
it
she
returned
and
brought
her
work
charity
children
great
cloaks
her
mother
had
cut
them
and
in
the
height
of
the
fashion
to
jane
hardie
dismay
and
julia
was
binding
hooding
etcetering
them
how
demurely
she
bent
her
lovely
head
over
her
charitable
work
while
alfred
poured
his
tale
into
her
ears
how
careful
she
was
not
to
speak
when
there
was
a
chance
of
his
speaking
how
often
she
said
one
thing
so
as
to
express
its
opposite
a
process
for
which
she
might
have
taken
out
a
patent
how
she
and
alfred
compared
and
their
feelings
at
each
stage
of
their
passion
their
hearts
put
forth
tendril
after
tendril
and
so
curled
and
clung
round
each
other
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
blissful
day
julia
suddenly
remembered
that
this
was
dull
for
her
mother
to
have
such
a
thought
was
to
fly
to
her
and
she
flew
so
swiftly
that
she
caught
dodd
in
tears
and
trying
adroitly
and
vainly
to
hide
them
what
is
the
matter
i
am
a
wretch
i
have
left
you
do
not
think
me
so
peevish
love
you
have
but
surprised
the
natural
regrets
of
a
mother
at
the
loss
of
her
oh
mamma
said
julia
warmly
and
do
you
think
all
the
marriage
in
the
world
can
ever
divide
you
and
me
can
make
me
lukewarm
to
my
own
sweet
darling
beautiful
blessed
angel
mother
look
at
me
i
am
as
much
your
julia
as
ever
and
shall
be
while
i
live
your
son
is
your
son
till
he
gets
him
a
wife
but
your
daughter
your
daughter
all
the
days
of
her
divine
power
of
native
eloquence
with
this
trite
distich
you
made
hexameters
tame
it
gushed
from
that
great
young
heart
with
a
sweet
infantine
ardour
that
even
virtue
can
only
pour
when
young
and
youth
when
virtuous
and
at
the
words
i
have
emphasised
by
the
poor
device
of
capitals
two
lovely
supple
arms
flew
wide
out
like
a
soaring
albatross
wings
and
then
went
all
round
the
sad
mother
and
gathered
every
bit
of
her
up
to
the
generous
young
bosom
i
know
it
i
know
it
cried
dodd
kissing
her
i
shall
never
lose
my
daughter
while
she
breathes
but
i
am
losing
my
child
you
are
turning
to
a
woman
visibly
and
you
were
such
a
happy
child
hence
my
misgivings
and
these
weak
tears
which
you
have
dried
with
a
word
see
and
she
contrived
to
smile
and
now
go
down
dearest
he
may
be
impatient
men
love
is
so
the
next
day
dodd
took
julia
apart
and
asked
her
whether
there
was
an
answer
from
hardie
julia
replied
from
alfred
that
jane
had
received
a
letter
last
night
and
to
judge
by
the
contents
hardie
must
have
left
london
before
alfred
letter
got
there
he
is
gone
to
see
poor
uncle
why
do
you
call
him
oh
he
is
not
very
clever
has
not
much
mind
alfred
says
indeed
hardly
you
alarm
me
julia
cried
dodd
what
madness
in
the
family
you
propose
to
marry
into
oh
no
mamma
said
julia
in
a
great
hurry
no
madness
only
a
little
dodd
lip
curved
at
this
julian
answer
but
just
then
her
mind
was
more
drawn
to
another
topic
a
serious
doubt
passed
through
her
whether
if
hardie
did
not
write
soon
she
ought
not
to
limit
his
son
attendance
on
her
daughter
he
follows
her
about
like
a
little
dog
said
she
half
fretfully
next
day
by
previous
invitation
sampson
made
albion
villa
his
darting
in
from
london
he
found
alfred
sitting
very
close
to
julia
over
a
book
lordsake
cried
he
here
puppy
and
enthusiast
cheek
by
julia
turned
scarlet
and
alfred
ejaculated
so
loudly
that
sampson
inquired
what
on
airth
was
the
matter
now
oh
nothing
only
here
have
i
been
jealous
of
my
own
shadow
and
pestering
her
who
puppy
was
and
she
never
would
tell
me
all
i
could
get
from
her
added
he
turning
suddenly
from
gratitude
to
revenge
was
that
he
was
no
greater
a
puppy
than
yourself
oh
alfred
no
i
only
said
no
vainer
cried
julia
in
dismay
well
it
is
true
said
sampson
contentedly
and
proceeded
to
dissect
himself
just
as
he
would
a
stranger
i
am
a
vain
man
a
remarkably
vain
man
but
then
i
a
man
of
great
all
vain
people
are
that
suggested
alfred
dryly
who
should
know
better
than
you
young
oxford
y
have
got
a
no
do
tell
lies
now
ye
ca
deceive
me
man
i
an
eye
like
a
hawk
and
what
that
ye
studying
with
her
ovid
for
a
no
medicine
a
treatise
on
your
favourite
organ
the
brain
by
one
he
is
chaffing
you
doctor
said
edward
it
is
logic
he
is
coaching
her
and
then
she
will
coach
then
i
forbid
the
young
pidant
logic
is
an
ill
plaster
to
a
sore
oh
labour
we
delight
in
physics
pain
jinnyus
jinnyus
take
care
o
your
carkuss
retorted
the
master
of
doggrel
and
that
is
a
profounder
remark
than
you
seem
to
think
by
your
grinning
all
of
julia
settled
the
question
by
putting
away
the
book
and
she
murmured
to
alfred
i
wish
i
could
steal
your
poor
dear
headaches
you
might
give
me
half
of
them
at
least
you
would
too
if
you
really
loved
this
sound
remonstrance
escaped
criticism
by
being
nearly
inaudible
and
by
dodd
entering
at
the
same
moment
after
the
first
greeting
sampson
asked
her
with
merry
arrogance
how
his
prescription
had
worked
is
her
sleep
broken
still
are
her
spirits
up
and
down
shall
we
have
to
go
back
t
old
short
and
his
black
draught
how
her
mookis
membrin
and
her
biliary
ducks
an
she
off
like
a
and
no
wonder
said
dodd
reproachfully
thus
splashed
sampson
among
the
ducks
one
of
them
did
not
show
her
face
again
till
dinner
jane
hardie
accompanied
her
brother
by
invitation
the
general
amity
was
diversified
and
the
mirth
nowise
lessened
by
constant
passages
of
arms
between
sampson
and
alfred
hardie
after
tea
came
the
first
sampson
liked
a
game
of
cards
he
could
play
yet
talk
chronothermalism
as
the
fair
can
knit
shoes
and
imbibe
the
poetasters
of
the
day
dodd
had
asked
edward
to
bring
a
fresh
pack
he
was
seen
by
his
guardian
angel
to
take
them
out
of
his
pocket
and
undo
them
presently
sampson
in
his
rapid
way
clutched
hold
of
them
and
found
a
slip
of
paper
curled
round
the
ace
of
spades
with
this
written
very
clear
in
pencil
remember
thy
creator
in
the
days
of
thy
youth
what
is
this
cried
sampson
and
read
it
out
aloud
jane
hardie
coloured
and
so
betrayed
herself
her
word
in
season
had
strayed
it
was
the
young
and
comely
edward
she
wished
to
save
from
the
diabolical
literature
the
painted
perdition
and
not
the
uninteresting
old
sinner
sampson
who
proceeded
to
justify
her
preference
by
remarking
that
remember
not
to
trump
your
partner
best
card
ladies
would
be
more
to
the
point
everybody
except
this
hardened
personage
was
thoroughly
uncomfortable
as
for
alfred
his
face
betrayed
a
degree
of
youthful
mortification
little
short
of
agony
dodd
was
profoundly
disgusted
but
fortunately
for
the
hardies
caught
sight
of
his
burning
cheeks
and
compressed
lips
dr
sampson
said
she
with
cold
dignity
you
will
i
am
sure
oblige
me
by
making
no
more
comments
sincerity
is
not
always
discreet
but
it
is
always
respectable
it
is
one
of
your
own
titles
to
esteem
i
dare
say
added
she
with
great
sweetness
our
resources
are
not
so
narrow
that
we
need
shock
anybody
prejudices
and
as
it
happens
i
was
just
going
to
ask
julia
to
sing
open
the
piano
love
and
try
if
you
can
persuade
miss
hardie
to
join
you
in
a
at
this
jane
and
julia
had
an
earnest
conversation
at
the
piano
and
their
words
uttered
in
a
low
voice
were
covered
by
a
contemporaneous
discussion
between
sampson
and
dodd
no
you
must
not
ask
me
i
have
forsworn
these
vanities
i
have
not
opened
my
piano
this
two
years
oh
what
a
pity
music
is
so
beautiful
and
surely
we
can
choose
our
songs
as
easily
as
our
words
ah
how
much
more
easily
oh
i
do
go
so
far
as
to
call
music
wicked
but
music
in
society
is
a
snare
at
least
i
found
it
so
my
playing
was
highly
praised
and
that
stirred
up
vanity
and
so
did
my
singing
with
which
i
had
even
more
reason
to
be
satisfied
snares
snares
goodness
me
i
do
find
them
so
now
you
mention
it
gentlemen
do
praise
one
but
dear
me
they
praise
every
lady
even
when
we
have
been
singing
every
other
note
out
of
tune
the
little
unmeaning
compliments
of
society
can
they
catch
anything
so
great
as
a
soul
i
pray
daily
not
to
be
led
into
temptation
and
shall
i
go
into
it
of
my
own
accord
not
if
you
find
it
a
temptation
at
that
rate
i
ought
to
decline
that
does
follow
my
conscience
is
not
a
law
to
yours
besides
your
mamma
said
sing
and
a
parent
is
not
to
be
disobeyed
upon
a
doubt
if
papa
were
to
insist
on
my
going
to
a
ball
even
or
reading
a
novel
i
think
i
should
obey
and
lay
the
whole
case
before
him
from
a
distance
come
my
dears
sampson
is
getting
impatient
for
your
song
hum
for
all
that
young
ladies
singing
is
a
poor
substitute
for
cards
and
even
for
conversation
that
depends
upon
the
singer
i
presume
mai
dear
madam
they
all
sing
alike
just
as
they
all
write
alike
i
can
hardly
tell
one
fashionable
tune
from
another
and
nobody
can
tell
one
word
from
another
when
they
cut
out
all
the
consonants
listen
me
this
is
what
i
heard
sung
by
a
lady
last
night
eu

sounds

it

in

it

i
think
you

i
will
answer
for
julia
that
she
shall
speak
as
distinctly
to
music
as
you
do
in
conversation
all
unconscious
of
the
tap
time
will
show
madam
at

they
seem
to
be
in
no

to
spatter
us
with
their

some
spark
of
pity
linger
in
their
marble
or
do
they
prefer
t
inarticulate
mewing
julia
thus
pressed
sang
one
of
those
songs
that
come
and
go
every
season
she
spoke
the
words
clearly
and
with
such
variety
and
intelligence
that
sampson
recanted
and
broke
in
upon
the
very
pretty
how
sweet
and
who
is
it
by
of
the
others
by
shouting
very
weak
trash
very
cleanly
sung
now
give
us
something
worth
the
wear
and
tear
of
your
orgins
immortal
vairse
widded
t
immortal
sounds
that
is
what
i
understand
b
a
alfred
whispered
no
no
dearest
sing
something
suitable
to
you
and
out
of
the
question
then
go
farther
away
dear
i
shall
have
more
he
obeyed
and
she
turned
over
two
or
three
and
finally
sung
from
memory
she
cultivated
musical
memory
having
observed
the
contempt
with
which
men
of
sense
visit
the
sorry
pretenders
to
music
who
are
tuneless
and
songless
among
the
nightingales
and
anywhere
else
away
from
their
books
how
will
they
manage
to
sing
in
heaven
answer
me
that
the
song
julia
dodd
sang
on
this
happy
occasion
to
meet
the
humble
but
heterogeneous
views
of
sampson
and
hardie
was
a
simple
eloquent
irish
song
called
aileen
aroon
whose
history
was
a
curious
one
early
in
this
century
it
occurred
to
somebody
to
hymn
a
son
of
george
the
third
for
his
double
merit
in
having
been
born
and
going
to
a
ball
people
who
thus
apply
the
fine
arts
in
modern
days
are
seldom
artists
accordingly
this
parasite
could
not
invent
a
melody
so
he
coolly
stole
aileen
aroon
soiled
it
by
inserting
sordid
and
incongruous
jerks
into
the
refrain
and
called
the
stolen
and
adulterated
article
robin
adair
an
artisan
of
the
same
kidney
was
soon
found
to
write
words
down
to
the
degraded
ditty
and
so
strong
is
flunkeyism
and
so
weak
is
criticism
in
these
islands
that
the
polluted
tune
actually
superseded
the
clean
melody
and
this
sort
of
thing
who
was
in
uniform
at
the
ball
silly
billy
smothered
the
immortal
lines
but
dodd
severe
taste
in
music
rejected
those
ignoble
jerks
and
her
enthusiastic
daughter
having
the
option
to
hymn
immortal
constancy
or
mortal
fat
decided
thus
when
like
the
early
rose
aileen
aroon
beauty
in
childhood
glows
aileen
aroon
when
like
a
diadem
buds
blush
around
the
stem
which
is
the
fairest
gem
aileen
aroon
is
it
the
laughing
eye
aileen
aroon
is
it
the
timid
sigh
aileen
aroon
is
it
the
tender
tone
soft
as
the
string
harp
mean
no
it
is
truth
alone
aileen
aroon
i
know
a
valley
fair
aileen
aroon
i
know
a
cottage
there
aileen
aroon
far
in
that
valley
shade
i
know
a
gentle
maid
flower
of
the
hazel
glade
aileen
aroon
who
in
the
song
so
sweet
aileen
aroon
who
in
the
dance
so
fleet
aileen
aroon
dear
are
her
charms
to
me
dearer
her
laughter
free
dearest
her
constancy
aileen

youth
must
with
time
decay
aileen
aroon
beauty
must
fade
away
aileen

castles
are
sacked
in

chieftains
are
scattered
far
truth
is
a
fixed
star
aileen
areon
the
way
the
earnest
singer
sang
these
lines
is
beyond
the
conception
of
ordinary
singers
public
or
private
here
one
of
nature
orators
spoke
poetry
to
music
with
an
eloquence
as
fervid
and
delicate
as
ever
rung
in
the
forum
she
gave
each
verse
with
the
same
just
variety
as
if
she
had
been
reciting
and
when
she
came
to
the
last
where
the
thought
rises
abruptly
and
is
truly
noble
she
sang
it
with
the
sudden
pathos
the
weight
and
the
swelling
majesty
of
a
truthful
soul
hymning
truth
with
all
its
powers
all
the
hearers
even
sampson
were
thrilled
astonished
so
can
one
wave
of
immortal
music
and
immortal
verse
alas
how
seldom
they
meet
heave
the
inner
man
when
genius
interprets
judge
then
what
it
was
to
alfred
to
whom
with
these
great
words
and
thrilling
tones
of
her
rich
swelling
ringing
voice
the
darling
of
his
own
heart
vowed
constancy
while
her
inspired
face
beamed
on
him
like
an
angel
even
dodd
though
acquainted
with
the
song
and
with
her
rare
powers
gazed
at
her
now
with
some
surprise
as
well
as
admiration
and
kept
a
note
sarah
had
brought
her
open
but
unread
in
her
hand
unable
to
take
her
eyes
from
the
inspired
songstress
however
just
before
the
song
ended
she
did
just
glance
down
and
saw
it
was
signed
richard
hardie
on
this
her
eye
devoured
it
and
in
one
moment
she
saw
that
the
writer
declined
politely
but
peremptorily
the
proposed
alliance
between
his
son
and
her
daughter
the
mother
looked
up
from
this
paper
at
that
living
radiance
and
incarnate
melody
in
a
sort
of
stupor
it
seemed
hardly
possible
to
her
that
a
provincial
banker
could
refuse
an
alliance
with
a
creature
so
peerless
as
that
but
so
it
was
and
despite
her
habitual
dodd
white
hand
clenched
the
note
till
her
nails
dented
it
and
she
reddened
to
the
brow
with
anger
and
mortification
julia
whom
she
had
trained
never
to
monopolise
attention
in
society
now
left
the
piano
in
spite
of
remonstrance
and
soon
noticed
her
mother
face
for
from
red
it
had
become
paler
than
usual
are
you
unwell
dear
said
she
no
is
there
anything
the
matter
then
hush
we
have
guests
our
first
duty
is
to
with
this
dodd
rose
and
endeavouring
not
to
look
at
her
daughter
at
all
went
round
and
drew
each
of
her
guests
out
in
turn
it
was
the
very
heroism
of
courtesy
for
their
presence
was
torture
to
her
at
last
to
her
infinite
relief
they
went
and
she
was
left
alone
with
her
children
she
sent
the
servants
to
bed
saying
she
would
undress
miss
dodd
and
accompanied
her
to
her
room
there
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
lock
the
door
and
the
next
was
to
turn
round
and
look
at
her
full
i
always
thought
you
the
most
lovable
child
i
ever
saw
but
i
never
admired
you
as
i
have
my
noble
my
beautiful
daughter
who
would
grace
the
highest
family
in
with
this
dodd
began
to
choke
and
kissed
julia
eagerly
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
drew
her
with
tender
eloquent
defiance
to
her
bosom
my
own
mamma
said
julia
softly
what
has
happened
my
darling
said
dodd
trembling
a
little
have
you
pride
have
you
spirit
i
think
i
i
hope
so
for
you
will
need
them
both
read
that
and
she
held
out
hardie
letter
but
turned
her
own
head
away
not
to
see
her
girl
face
under
the
insult
chapter
vi
julia
took
hardie
note
and
read
it
madam
i
have
received
a
very
juvenile
letter
from
my
son
by
which
i
learn
he
has
formed
a
sudden
attachment
to
your
daughter
he
tells
me
however
at
the
same
time
that
you
await
my
concurrence
before
giving
your
consent
i
appreciate
your
delicacy
and
it
is
with
considerable
regret
i
now
write
to
inform
you
this
match
is
out
of
the
question
i
have
thought
it
due
to
you
to
communicate
this
to
yourself
and
without
delay
and
feel
sure
that
you
will
under
the
circumstances
discountenance
my
son
further
visits
at
your
house
i
am
madam
with
sincere
respect
your
faithful
servant
richard
julia
read
this
letter
and
it
in
silence
it
was
an
anxious
moment
to
the
mother
shall
our
pride
be
less
than
this
she
faltered
tell
me
yourself
what
ought
we
to
do
what
we
ought
to
do
is
never
to
let
the
name
of
hardie
be
mentioned
again
in
this
this
reply
was
very
comforting
to
dodd
shall
i
write
to
him
or
do
you
feel
strong
enough
i
feel
that
if
i
do
i
may
affront
him
he
had
no
right
to
pretend
that
his
father
would
consent
you
write
and
then
we
shall
not
lose
our
dignity
though
we
are
i
feel
so
weary
life
seems
ended
i
could
have
loved
him
well
and
now
show
me
how
to
tear
him
out
of
my
heart
or
what
will
become
of
me
while
dodd
wrote
to
alfred
hardie
julia
sank
down
and
laid
her
head
on
her
mother
knees
the
note
was
shown
her
she
approved
it
languidly
a
long
and
sad
conversation
followed
and
after
kissing
her
mother
and
clinging
to
her
she
went
to
bed
chilly
and
listless
but
did
not
shed
a
single
tear
her
young
heart
was
benumbed
by
the
unexpected
blow
next
morning
early
alfred
hardie
started
gaily
to
spend
the
day
at
albion
villa
not
a
hundred
yards
from
the
gate
he
met
sarah
with
dodd
letter
enclosing
a
copy
of
his
father
to
her
dodd
here
reminded
him
that
his
visits
had
been
encouraged
only
upon
a
misapprehension
of
his
father
sentiments
for
which
misapprehension
he
was
in
some
degree
to
blame
not
that
she
meant
to
reproach
him
on
that
score
especially
at
this
unhappy
moment
no
she
rather
blamed
herself
for
listening
to
the
sanguine
voice
of
youth
but
the
error
must
now
be
repaired
she
and
julia
would
always
wish
him
well
and
esteem
him
provided
he
made
no
further
attempt
to
compromise
a
young
lady
who
could
not
be
his
wife
the
note
concluded
thus
individually
i
think
i
have
some
right
to
count
on
your
honourable
feeling
to
hold
no
communication
with
my
daughter
and
not
in
any
way
to
attract
her
attention
under
the
present
i
am
dear
alfred
hardie
with
many
regrets
at
the
pain
i
fear
i
am
giving
you
your
sincere
friend
and
lucy
alfred
on
reading
this
letter
literally
staggered
but
proud
and
sensitive
as
well
as
loving
he
manned
himself
to
hide
his
wound
from
sarah
whose
black
eyes
were
bent
on
him
in
merciless
scrutiny
he
said
doggedly
though
tremulously
very
well
then
turned
quickly
on
his
heel
and
went
slowly
home
dodd
with
indifference
questioned
sarah
privately
the
girl
account
of
the
abrupt
way
in
which
he
had
received
the
missive
added
to
her
anxiety
she
warned
the
servants
that
no
one
was
at
home
to
alfred
hardie
two
days
elapsed
and
then
she
received
a
letter
from
him
poor
fellow
it
was
the
eleventh
he
had
written
and
torn
up
ten
dear
dodd
i
have
gained
some
victories
in
my
life
but
not
one
without
two
defeats
to
begin
with
how
then
can
i
expect
to
obtain
such
a
prize
as
dear
julia
without
a
check
or
two
you
need
not
fear
that
i
shall
intrude
after
your
appeal
to
me
as
a
gentleman
but
i
am
not
going
to
give
in
because
my
father
has
written
a
hasty
letter
from
yorkshire
he
and
i
must
have
many
a
talk
face
to
face
before
i
consent
to
be
miserable
for
life
dear
dodd
at
first
receipt
of
your
cruel
letter
so
kindly
worded
i
was
but
now
i
am
myself
again
difficulties
are
made
for
ladies
to
yield
to
and
for
men
to
conquer
only
for
pity
sake
do
not
you
be
my
enemy
do
not
set
her
against
me
for
my
father
fault
think
if
you
can
how
my
heart
bleeds
at
closing
this
letter
without
one
word
to
her
i
love
better
a
thousand
times
better
than
my
life
i
am
dear
dodd
yours
sorrowfully
but
not
despairing
alfred
dodd
kept
this
letter
to
herself
she
could
not
read
it
quite
unmoved
and
therefore
she
felt
sure
it
would
disturb
her
heart
the
more
alfred
had
now
a
soft
but
dangerous
antagonist
in
dodd
all
the
mother
was
in
arms
to
secure
her
daughter
happiness
coute
and
the
surest
course
seemed
to
be
to
detach
her
affections
from
alfred
what
hope
of
a
peaceful
heart
without
this
and
what
real
happiness
without
peace
but
too
wise
and
calm
to
interfere
blindly
she
watched
her
daughter
day
and
night
to
find
whether
love
or
pride
was
the
stronger
and
this
is
what
she
observed
julia
never
mentioned
alfred
she
sought
occupation
eagerly
came
oftener
than
usual
for
money
saying
it
was
for
she
visited
the
poor
more
constantly
taking
one
of
the
maids
with
her
at
dodd
request
she
studied
logic
with
edward
she
went
to
bed
rather
early
fatigued
it
would
appear
by
her
activity
and
she
gave
the
clue
to
her
own
conduct
one
day
mamma
said
she
nobody
is
downright
unhappy
who
is
dodd
noticed
also
a
certain
wildness
and
almost
violence
with
which
she
threw
herself
into
her
occupations
and
a
worn
look
about
the
eyes
that
told
of
a
hidden
conflict
on
the
whole
dodd
was
hopeful
for
she
had
never
imagined
the
cure
would
be
speedy
or
easy
to
see
her
child
on
the
right
road
was
much
only
the
great
healer
time
could
medicine
her
to
that
sweet
peace
which
once
she
owned
and
even
time
can
not
give
her
back
her
childhood
thought
the
mother
with
a
sigh
one
day
came
an
invitation
to
an
evening
party
at
a
house
where
they
always
wound
up
with
dancing
dodd
was
for
declining
as
usual
for
since
that
night
julia
had
shunned
parties
give
me
the
sorrows
of
the
poor
and
afflicted
was
her
cry
the
gaiety
of
the
hollow
world
jars
me
more
than
i
can
but
now
she
caught
with
a
sort
of
eagerness
at
this
invitation
accept
they
shall
not
say
i
am
wearing
the
my
brave
girl
said
dodd
joyfully
i
would
not
press
it
but
you
are
right
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
to
outface
scandal
still
let
there
be
no
precipitation
we
must
not
undertake
beyond
our
try
me
said
julia
you
do
know
what
i
can
do
i
dare
say
is
not
pining
for
she
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
and
indeed
so
feverishly
brilliant
that
dodd
said
softly
to
her
gently
love
moderate
your
spirits
or
they
will
deceive
our
friends
as
little
as
they
do
meantime
it
cost
alfred
hardie
a
severe
struggle
to
keep
altogether
aloof
from
julia
in
fact
it
was
a
state
of
daily
to
which
he
would
never
have
committed
himself
but
that
he
was
quite
sure
he
could
gradually
win
his
father
over
at
his
age
we
are
apt
to
count
without
our
antagonist
richard
hardie
was
a
he
knew
the
consequence
of
giving
one
reasons
eternal
discussion
ending
in
war
he
had
taken
care
not
to
give
any
to
dodd
and
he
was
as
guarded
and
reserved
with
alfred
the
young
man
begged
to
know
the
why
and
the
wherefore
and
being
repulsed
employed
all
his
art
to
elicit
them
by
surprise
or
get
at
them
by
inference
but
all
in
vain
hardie
senior
was
impenetrable
and
inquiry
petulance
tenderness
logic
were
all
shattered
on
him
as
the
waves
break
on
ailsa
craig
thus
began
dissension
decently
conducted
at
first
between
a
father
indulgent
hitherto
and
an
affectionate
son
in
this
unfortunate
collision
of
two
strong
and
kindred
natures
every
advantage
was
at
present
on
the
father
side
age
experience
authority
resolution
hidden
and
powerful
motives
to
which
my
reader
even
has
no
clue
as
yet
a
purpose
immutable
and
concealed
add
to
these
a
colder
nature
and
a
far
colder
affection
for
alfred
loved
his
father
dearly
at
last
one
day
the
impetuous
one
lost
his
and
said
he
was
a
son
not
a
slave
and
had
little
respect
for
authority
when
afraid
or
ashamed
to
appeal
to
reason
hardie
senior
turned
on
him
with
a
gravity
and
dignity
no
man
could
wear
more
naturally
alfred
have
i
been
an
unkind
father
to
you
all
these
years
oh
no
father
no
i
have
said
nothing
that
can
be
so
construed
and
that
is
the
mystery
to
me
you
are
acting
quite
out
of
have
i
been
one
of
those
interfering
pragmatical
fathers
who
can
not
let
their
children
enjoy
themselves
their
own
way
no
sir
you
have
never
interfered
except
to
pay
for
anything
i
then
make
the
one
return
in
your
power
young
man
have
a
little
faith
in
such
a
father
and
believe
that
he
does
not
interfere
now
but
for
your
good
and
under
a
stern
necessity
and
that
when
he
does
interfere
for
once
and
say
thing
shall
not
be
it
shall
not
be
by
heaven
alfred
was
overpowered
by
the
weight
and
solemnity
of
this
sorrow
vexation
and
despondency
all
rushed
into
his
heart
together
and
unmanned
him
for
a
moment
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
something
very
like
a
sob
burst
from
his
young
heart
at
this
hardie
senior
took
up
the
newspaper
with
imperturbable
coldness
and
wore
a
slight
curl
of
the
lip
all
this
was
hardly
genuine
for
he
was
not
altogether
unmoved
but
he
was
a
man
of
rare
and
chose
to
impress
on
alfred
that
he
was
no
more
to
be
broken
or
melted
than
a
mere
rock
it
is
always
precarious
to
act
a
part
and
this
cynicism
was
rather
able
than
wise
alfred
looked
up
and
watched
him
keenly
as
he
read
the
monetary
article
with
tranquil
interest
and
then
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
flashed
into
the
young
man
mind
that
his
father
was
not
a
father
i
never
knew
him
till
now
thought
he
this
man
is
greek
text
bowels
of
affection
thus
a
gesture
so
to
speak
sowed
the
first
seed
of
downright
disunion
in
richard
hardie
house
disunion
a
plant
when
men
set
it
in
the
soil
of
the
passions
alfred
unlike
julia
had
no
panacea
had
any
lips
except
perhaps
hers
told
him
that
to
be
good
is
to
be
happy
here
below
he
would
have
replied
negatur
contradicted
by
daily
it
never
occurred
to
him
therefore
to
go
out
of
himself
and
sympathise
with
the
sordid
sorrows
of
the
poor
and
their
bottomless
egotism
in
contact
with
the
he
brooded
on
his
own
love
and
his
own
unhappiness
and
his
own
father
cruelty
his
nights
were
sleepless
and
his
days
leaden
he
tried
hard
to
read
for
his
first
class
but
for
once
even
ambition
failed
it
ended
in
flinging
books
away
in
despair
he
wandered
about
dreaming
and
moping
for
some
change
and
bitterly
regretting
his
excessive
delicacy
which
had
tied
his
own
hands
and
brought
him
to
a
he
lost
his
colour
and
what
little
flesh
he
had
to
lose
for
such
young
spirits
as
this
are
never
plump
in
a
word
being
now
into
feminine
inactivity
while
void
of
feminine
patience
his
ardent
heart
was
pining
and
fretting
itself
out
he
was
in
this
condition
when
one
day
peterson
his
oxonian
friend
burst
in
on
him
with
delight
and
as
usual
with
bright
spirits
of
this
calibre
did
not
even
notice
his
friend
sadness
cupid
had
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
as
shakespeare
hath
it
and
it
was
a
deal
nicer
than
the
rheumatism
oh
such
a
divine
creature
met
her
twice
you
know
her
by
sight
her
name
is
dodd
but
i
do
care
it
shall
be
peterson
the
rose
by
any
other
name
then
followed
a
rapturous
description
of
the
person
well
worth
omitting
and
such
a
jolly
girl
brightens
them
all
up
wherever
she
goes
and
such
a
dancer
did
the
cachouka
with
a
little
spanish
bloke
bosanquet
has
got
hold
of
and
made
his
black
bolus
eyes
twinkle
like
midnight
cigars
danced
it
with
castanets
and
smiles
and
such
a
what
d
call
my
boy
you
know
such
a
you
mean
such
an
groaned
alfred
turning
sick
at
heart
that
the
word
twice
the
spirit
of
duvernay
and
ten
times
the
beauty
but
just
you
hear
her
sing
that
is
all
italian
french
german
english
plaintive
songs
oh
whatever
they
ask
for
make
you
laugh
or
make
you
cry
to
order
never
says
no
just
smiles
and
sits
down
to
the
only
she
wo
sing
two
running
they
have
to
stick
a
duffer
in
between
i
shall
meet
her
again
next
week
will
you
come
any
friend
of
mine
is
welcome
wish
me
joy
old
fellow
i
a
gone
this
news
put
alfred
in
a
phrensy
of
indignation
and
fear
julia
dancing
the
cachouka
julia
a
jolly
girl
julia
singing
songs
pathetic
or
merry
whichever
were
asked
for
the
heartless
one
he
called
to
mind
all
he
had
read
in
the
classics
and
elsewhere
about
the
fickleness
of
woman
but
this
impression
did
not
last
long
he
recalled
julia
character
and
all
the
signs
of
a
love
tender
and
true
she
had
given
him
he
read
her
by
himself
and
laid
all
the
blame
on
another
it
was
all
her
mother
fool
that
i
have
been
i
see
it
all
now
she
appeals
to
my
delicacy
to
keep
away
then
she
goes
to
julia
and
says
he
deserts
you
at
a
word
from
his
father
be
proud
be
gay
he
never
loved
you
marry
another
the
shallow
plotter
forgets
that
whoever
she
does
marry
i
kill
how
many
unsuspicious
girls
have
these
mothers
deluded
so
they
do
it
in
half
the
novels
especially
in
those
written
by
women
and
why
because
these
know
the
perfidy
and
mendacity
of
their
sex
better
than
we
do
they
see
them
nearer
and
with
their
souls
undrest
war
dodd
war
to
the
death
from
this
moment
i
am
alone
in
the
world
with
her
i
have
no
friend
but
alfred
hardie
and
my
bitterest
enemies
are
my
father
and
her
the
above
sentences
of
course
were
never
uttered
but
they
represent
his
thoughts
accurately
though
in
a
condensed
form
and
are
as
it
were
a
miniature
of
this
young
heart
boiling
over
from
that
moment
he
lay
in
wait
for
her
and
hovered
about
the
house
day
and
night
determined
to
appeal
to
her
personally
and
undeceive
her
and
baffle
her
mother
treachery
but
at
this
game
he
was
soon
detected
dodd
lived
on
the
watch
now
julia
dressed
to
go
out
went
to
the
window
one
afternoon
to
look
at
the
weather
but
retreated
somewhat
hastily
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
you
flutter
darling
said
dodd
ah
he
is
you
had
better
take
off
your
oh
yes
i
tremble
at
the
thoughts
of
meeting
him
mamma
he
is
changed
sadly
changed
poor
poor
alfred
she
went
to
her
own
room
and
prayed
for
him
she
informed
the
omniscient
that
though
much
greater
and
better
in
other
respects
than
she
was
he
had
not
patience
she
prayed
with
tears
that
he
might
have
christian
patience
granted
him
from
on
high
heart
of
stone
she
shuns
me
said
alfred
outside
he
had
seen
her
in
her
bonnet
dodd
waited
several
days
to
see
whether
this
annoyance
would
not
die
of
itself
waiting
was
her
plan
in
most
things
finding
he
was
not
to
be
tired
out
she
sent
sarah
out
to
him
with
a
note
carefully
sealed
mr
alfred
hardie
is
it
generous
to
confine
my
daughter
to
the
house
yours
regretfully
lucy
a
line
came
back
instantly
in
pencil
mrs
dodd
is
all
the
generosity
and
all
the
good
faith
to
be
on
one
side
yours
in
despair
alfred
dodd
coloured
faintly
the
reproach
pricked
her
but
did
not
move
her
she
sat
quietly
down
that
moment
and
wrote
to
a
friend
in
london
to
look
out
for
a
furnished
villa
in
a
healthy
part
of
the
suburbs
with
immediate
possession
circumstances
said
she
making
it
desirable
we
should
leave
barkington
immediately
and
for
some
the
bosanquets
gave
a
large
party
and
miss
dodd
were
there
the
latter
was
playing
a
part
in
a
charade
to
the
admiration
of
all
present
when
in
came
peterson
introducing
his
friend
alfred
hardie
julia
caught
the
name
and
turned
a
look
of
alarm
on
her
mother
but
went
on
acting
presently
she
caught
sight
of
him
at
some
distance
he
looked
very
pale
and
his
glittering
eye
was
fixed
on
her
with
a
sort
of
stern
wonder
such
a
glance
from
fiery
eyes
that
had
always
dwelt
tenderly
on
her
till
then
struck
her
like
a
weapon
she
stopped
short
and
turned
red
and
pale
by
turns
there
that
is
nonsense
enough
said
she
bitterly
and
went
and
sat
by
dodd
the
gentlemen
thronged
round
her
with
compliments
and
begged
her
to
sing
she
excused
herself
presently
she
heard
an
excited
voice
towards
which
she
dared
not
look
it
was
inquiring
whether
any
lady
could
sing
aileen
aroon
with
every
desire
to
gratify
the
young
millionaire
nobody
knew
aileen
aroon
nor
had
ever
heard
of
it
oh
impossible
cried
alfred
why
it
is
in
praise
of
constancy
a
virtue
ladies
shine
in
at
least
they
take
credit
for
mamma
whispered
julia
terrified
get
me
away
or
there
will
be
a
scene
he
is
be
calm
love
said
dodd
there
shall
be
she
rose
and
glided
up
to
alfred
hardie
looked
coldly
in
his
face
then
said
with
external
politeness
and
veiled
contempt
i
will
attempt
the
song
sir
since
you
desire
she
waved
her
hand
and
he
followed
her
sulkily
to
the
piano
she
sung
aileen
aroon
not
with
her
daughter
eloquence
but
with
a
purity
and
mellowness
that
charmed
the
room
they
had
never
heard
the
genius
sing
it
as
spirits
are
said
to
overcome
the
man
at
whose
behest
they
rise
so
this
sweet
air
and
the
gush
of
reminiscence
it
awakened
overpowered
him
who
had
evoked
them
alfred
put
his
hand
unconsciously
to
his
swelling
heart
cast
one
look
of
anguish
at
julia
and
hurried
away
half
choked
nobody
but
julia
noticed
a
fellow
in
a
rough
and
tattered
white
hat
opened
the
fly
door
for
dodd
as
julia
followed
her
he
kissed
her
skirt
unseen
by
dodd
but
her
quick
ears
caught
a
sigh
she
looked
and
recognised
alfred
in
that
disguise
the
penitent
fit
had
succeeded
to
the
angry
one
had
julia
observed
to
ascertain
this
without
speaking
of
him
dodd
waited
till
they
had
got
some
little
distance
then
quietly
put
out
her
hand
and
rested
it
for
a
moment
on
her
daughter
the
girl
was
trembling
violently
little
wretch
came
to
lips
but
she
did
not
utter
it
they
were
near
home
before
she
spoke
at
all
and
then
she
only
said
very
kindly
my
love
you
will
not
be
subjected
again
to
these
trials
a
remark
intended
quietly
to
cover
the
last
occurrence
as
well
as
alfred
open
persecution
they
had
promised
to
go
out
the
very
next
day
but
dodd
went
alone
and
made
excuses
for
miss
dodd
on
her
return
she
found
julia
sitting
up
for
her
and
a
letter
come
from
her
friend
describing
a
pleasant
cottage
now
vacant
near
maida
vale
dodd
handed
the
open
letter
to
julia
she
read
it
without
comment
we
will
go
up
and
take
it
for
three
months
then
the
oxford
vacation
will
yes
i
am
now
about
to
relate
a
circumstance
by
no
means
without
parallels
but
almost
impossible
to
account
for
and
as
nothing
is
more
common
and
contemptible
than
inadequate
solutions
i
will
offer
none
at
all
but
so
it
was
that
dodd
awoke
in
the
middle
of
that
very
night
in
a
mysterious
state
of
mental
tremor
trouble
veiled
in
obscurity
seemed
to
sit
heavy
on
her
bosom
so
strong
though
vague
was
this
new
and
mysterious
oppression
that
she
started
up
in
bed
and
cried
aloud
david
julia
oh
what
is
the
matter
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
dispelled
the
cloud
in
part
but
not
entirely
she
lay
awhile
and
then
finding
herself
quite
averse
to
sleep
rose
and
went
to
her
window
and
eyed
the
weather
anxiously
it
was
a
fine
night
soft
fleecy
clouds
drifted
slowly
across
a
silver
moon
the
sailor
wife
was
reassured
on
her
husband
behalf
her
next
desire
was
to
look
at
julia
sleeping
she
had
no
particular
object
it
was
the
instinctive
impulse
of
an
anxious
mother
whom
something
had
terrified
she
put
on
her
slippers
and
and
lighting
a
candle
at
her
opened
her
door
softly
and
stepped
into
the
little
corridor
but
she
had
not
taken
two
steps
when
she
was
arrested
by
a
mysterious
sound
it
came
from
julia
room
what
was
it
dodd
glided
softly
nearer
and
nearer
all
her
senses
on
the
stretch
the
sound
came
again
it
was
a
muffled
sob
the
stifled
sound
just
audible
in
the
dead
stillness
of
the
night
went
through
and
through
her
who
stood
there
listening
aghast
her
bowels
yearned
over
her
child
and
she
hurried
to
the
door
but
recollected
herself
and
knocked
very
gently
do
be
alarmed
love
it
is
only
me
may
i
come
in
she
did
not
wait
for
the
answer
but
turned
the
handle
and
entered
she
found
julia
sitting
up
in
bed
looking
wildly
at
her
with
cheeks
flushed
and
wet
she
sat
on
the
bed
and
clasped
her
to
her
breast
in
silence
but
more
than
one
warm
tear
ran
down
upon
bare
neck
the
girl
felt
them
drop
and
her
own
gushed
in
a
shower
oh
what
have
i
done
she
sobbed
am
i
to
make
you
wretched
too
dodd
did
not
immediately
reply
she
was
there
to
console
and
her
admirable
good
sense
told
her
that
to
do
that
she
must
be
calmer
than
her
patient
so
even
while
she
kissed
and
wept
over
julia
she
managed
gradually
to
recover
her
composure
tell
me
my
child
said
she
why
do
you
act
a
part
with
me
why
brave
it
out
under
my
eye
and
spend
the
night
secretly
in
tears
are
you
still
afraid
to
trust
me
oh
no
no
but
i
thought
i
was
so
strong
so
proud
i
undertook
miracles
i
soon
found
my
pride
was
a
molehill
and
my
love
a
mountain
i
could
not
hold
out
by
day
if
i
did
not
ease
my
breaking
heart
at
night
how
unfortunate
i
kept
my
head
under
the
too
but
you
have
such
ears
i
thought
i
would
stifle
my
grief
or
else
perhaps
you
would
be
as
wretched
as
i
am
forgive
me
pray
forgive
me
on
one
condition
said
dodd
struggling
with
the
emotion
these
simple
words
caused
her
anything
to
be
forgiven
cried
julia
impetuously
i
go
to
london
i
go
to
botany
bay
i
deserve
to
be
then
from
this
hour
no
between
us
dear
me
you
carry
in
your
own
bosom
a
much
harsher
judge
a
much
less
indulgent
friend
than
i
am
come
trust
me
with
your
heart
do
you
love
him
very
much
does
your
happiness
depend
on
him
at
this
question
julia
put
her
head
over
shoulder
not
to
be
seen
and
clasping
her
tight
murmured
scarce
above
a
whisper
i
do
know
how
much
i
love
him
when
he
came
in
at
that
party
i
felt
his
slave
his
unfaithful
adoring
slave
if
he
had
ordered
me
to
sing
aileen
aroon
i
should
have
obeyed
if
he
had
commanded
me
to
take
his
hand
and
leave
the
room
i
think
i
should
have
obeyed
his
face
is
always
before
me
as
plain
as
life
it
used
to
come
to
me
bright
and
loving
now
it
is
pale
and
stern
and
sad
i
was
not
so
wretched
till
i
saw
he
was
pining
for
me
and
thinks
me
inconstant
oh
mamma
so
pale
so
shrunk
i
so
reckless
he
was
sorry
for
misbehaving
that
night
he
changed
clothes
with
a
beggar
to
kiss
my
dress
poor
thing
poor
thing
who
ever
loved
as
he
does
me
i
am
dying
for
him
i
am
there
there
said
dodd
soothingly
you
have
said
enough
this
must
be
love
i
am
on
your
alfred
side
from
this
julia
opened
her
eyes
and
was
a
good
deal
agitated
as
well
as
surprised
pray
do
not
raise
my
hopes
she
gasped
we
are
parted
for
ever
his
father
refuses
even
you
seemed
averse
or
have
i
been
dreaming
me
dearest
how
can
i
be
averse
to
anything
lawful
on
which
i
find
your
heart
is
really
set
and
your
happiness
at
stake
of
course
i
have
stopped
the
actual
intercourse
under
existing
circumstances
but
these
circumstances
are
not
unalterable
your
only
obstacle
is
richard
but
what
an
obstacle
sighed
julia
his
father
a
man
of
iron
so
everybody
says
for
i
have
made
inquiries
oh
and
she
was
abashed
she
resumed
hastily
and
that
letter
so
cold
so
cruel
i
feel
it
was
written
by
one
not
open
to
gentle
influences
he
does
not
think
me
worthy
of
his
son
so
accomplished
so
distinguished
at
the
very
university
where
our
poor
edward
has
you
know
little
simpleton
said
dodd
and
kissed
her
tenderly
your
iron
man
is
the
commonest
clay
sordid
pliable
and
your
stern
heroic
brutus
is
a
shopkeeper
he
is
open
to
the
gentle
influences
which
sway
the
kindred
souls
of
the
men
you
and
i
buy
our
shoes
our
tea
our
gloves
our
of
and
these
influences
i
think
i
command
and
am
prepared
to
use
them
to
the
julia
lay
silent
and
wondering
what
she
could
mean
but
dodd
hesitated
now
it
pained
and
revolted
her
to
show
her
enthusiastic
girl
the
world
as
it
is
she
said
as
much
and
added
i
seem
to
be
going
to
aid
all
these
people
to
take
the
bloom
from
my
own
child
innocence
heaven
help
me
oh
never
mind
that
cried
julia
in
her
ardent
way
give
me
truth
before
error
however
dodd
replied
only
by
a
sigh
grand
general
sentiments
like
that
never
penetrated
her
mind
they
glided
off
like
water
from
a
back
we
will
begin
with
this
mercantile
brutus
then
said
she
with
such
a
curl
of
the
lip
brutus
had
rejected
her
daughter
mr
richard
hardie
was
born
and
bred
in
a
bank
one
where
no
wild
thyme
blows
my
poor
enthusiast
nor
cowslips
nor
the
nodding
violet
grows
but
gold
and
silver
chink
and
things
are
discounted
and
men
grow
rich
slowly
but
surely
by
lawful
use
of
other
people
money
breathed
upon
by
these
influences
he
was
from
his
youth
a
remarkable
man
measured
by
trade
standard
at
divine
what
he
did
he
saved
the
bank
you
have
read
of
bubbles
the
mississippi
bubble
and
the
south
sea
bubble
well
in
the
year
it
was
not
one
bubble
but
a
thousand
mines
by
the
score
and
in
distant
lands
companies
by
the
hundred
loans
to
every
nation
or
tribe
down
to
guatemala
patagonia
and
greece
two
hundred
new
ships
were
laid
on
the
stocks
in
one
year
for
your
dear
papa
told
me
in
short
a
fever
of
speculation
and
the
whole
nation
raging
with
it
my
dear
princes
dukes
duchesses
bishops
poets
lawyers
physicians
were
seen
struggling
with
their
own
footmen
for
a
place
in
the
exchange
and
at
last
good
steady
old
hardie
alfred
grandfather
was
drawn
into
the
vortex
now
to
excuse
him
and
appreciate
the
precocious
richard
you
must
try
and
realise
that
these
bubbles
when
they
rise
are
as
alluring
and
reasonable
as
they
are
ridiculous
and
incredible
when
one
looks
back
on
them
even
soap
bubbles
you
know
have
rainbow
hues
till
they
burst
and
indeed
the
blind
avarice
of
men
does
but
resemble
the
blind
vanity
of
women
look
at
our
grandmothers
hoops
and
our
mothers
short
waists
and
monstrous
heads
yet
in
their
day
what
woman
did
not
glory
in
these
insanities
well
then
richard
hardie
at
was
the
one
to
foresee
the
end
of
all
these
bubbles
he
came
down
from
london
and
brought
his
people
to
their
senses
by
sober
reason
and
commercial
principles
that
means
i
believe
other
people
money
but
do
not
risk
your
own
his
superiority
was
so
clear
that
his
father
resigned
the
helm
to
him
and
thanks
to
his
ability
the
bank
weathered
the
storm
while
all
the
other
ones
in
the
town
broke
or
suspended
their
trade
now
you
know
youth
is
naturally
ardent
and
speculative
but
richard
hardie
was
colder
and
wiser
than
other
people
old
age
and
that
is
one
trait
some
years
later
in
the
height
of
his
prosperity
i
reveal
this
only
for
your
comfort
and
on
your
sacred
promise
as
a
person
of
delicacy
never
to
repeat
it
to
a
soul
richard
hardie
was
a
suitor
for
my
mamma
do
not
ejaculate
sweetest
it
discomposes
me
is
extraordinary
as
that
good
creature
sampson
says
he
must
have
thought
it
would
in
one
way
or
another
to
have
a
gentlewoman
at
the
head
of
his
table
and
i
was
not
penniless
failing
in
this
he
found
a
plain
little
thing
with
a
gloomy
temper
and
no
accomplishments
nor
graces
but
her
father
could
settle
twenty
thousand
pounds
he
married
her
directly
and
that
is
a
trait
he
sold
his
father
and
grandfather
house
and
place
of
business
in
spite
of
all
their
associations
and
obtained
a
lease
of
his
present
place
from
my
uncle
fountain
it
seemed
a
more
situation
a
trait
he
gives
me
no
reason
for
rejecting
my
daughter
why
because
he
is
not
proud
of
his
reasons
this
walking
avarice
has
intelligence
a
trait
now
put
all
this
together
and
who
more
transparent
than
the
profound
hardie
he
has
declined
our
alliance
because
he
takes
for
granted
we
are
poor
when
i
undeceive
him
on
that
head
he
will
reopen
in
a
letter
no
of
the
correspondence
copied
by
one
of
his
clerks
it
will
be
calm
plausible
flattering
in
short
it
will
be
done
like
a
gentleman
though
he
is
nothing
of
the
kind
and
this
brings
me
to
what
i
ought
to
have
begun
with
your
dear
father
and
i
have
always
lived
within
our
income
for
our
children
sake
he
is
bringing
home
the
bulk
of
our
savings
this
very
voyage
and
it
amounts
to
fourteen
thousand
oh
what
an
enormous
sum
no
dearest
it
is
not
a
fortune
in
itself
but
it
is
a
considerable
sum
to
possess
independent
of
one
settlement
and
one
income
it
is
loose
cash
to
speak
hardie
that
means
i
can
do
what
i
choose
with
it
and
of
course
i
choose
to
make
you
happy
how
i
shall
work
on
what
you
call
iron
and
i
venture
to
call
clay
must
be
guided
by
circumstances
i
think
of
depositing
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
every
month
with
hardie
he
is
our
banker
you
know
he
will
most
likely
open
his
eyes
and
make
some
move
before
the
whole
sum
is
in
his
hands
if
he
does
not
i
shall
perhaps
call
at
his
bank
and
draw
a
cheque
for
fourteen
thousand
pounds
the
wealthiest
provincial
banker
does
not
keep
such
a
sum
floating
in
his
his
commercial
honour
the
one
sentiment
in
his
soul
would
be
in
peril
he
would
yield
and
with
grace
none
the
less
readily
that
his
house
and
his
bank
which
have
been
long
heavily
mortgaged
to
our
trustees
were
made
virtually
theirs
by
agreement
yesterday
i
set
this
on
foot
with
twelve
hours
of
iron
impertinent
letter
and
he
will
say
to
himself
can
post
me
i
think
these
people
call
it
this
afternoon
for
not
cashing
her
cheque
and
she
can
turn
me
and
my
bank
into
the
street
and
then
of
course
he
shall
see
by
my
manner
the
velvet
paw
is
offered
as
well
as
the
claw
he
is
pretty
sure
to
ask
himself
which
will
suit
the
best
this
cat
friendship
and
her
fourteen
thousand
pounds
or
an
insulted
mother
enmity
and
placid
teeth
made
a
little
click
just
audible
in
the
silent
night
oh
mamma
my
heart
is
sick
am
i
to
be
bought
and
sold
like
this
dodd
sighed
but
said
calmly
you
must
pay
the
penalty
for
loving
a
son
come
julia
no
peevishness
no
more
romance
no
more
vacillation
you
have
tried
pride
and
failed
pitiably
now
i
insist
on
your
trying
love
child
it
is
the
bane
of
our
sex
to
carry
nothing
out
from
that
weakness
i
will
preserve
you
and
we
are
not
going
to
marry
richard
hardie
but
alfred
now
alfred
with
all
his
faults
and
defects
mamma
what
faults
what
defects
is
a
gentleman
thanks
to
oxford
and
harrow
and
nature
my
darling
pray
to
heaven
night
and
day
for
your
dear
father
safe
return
for
on
him
and
him
alone
your
happiness
depends
as
mine
mamma
cried
julia
embracing
her
what
do
poor
girls
do
who
have
lost
their
mother
look
abroad
and
see
was
the
grave
reply
dodd
then
begged
her
to
go
to
sleep
like
a
good
child
for
her
health
sake
all
would
be
well
and
with
this
was
about
to
return
to
her
own
room
but
a
white
hand
and
arm
darted
out
of
the
bed
and
caught
her
what
hope
has
come
to
me
by
night
in
the
form
of
an
angel
and
shall
i
let
her
go
back
to
her
own
room
never
never
never
never
never
and
she
patted
the
bed
expressively
and
with
the
prettiest
impatience
well
let
hope
take
off
her
earrings
first
suggested
dodd
no
no
come
here
directly
earrings
and
no
thank
you
or
i
shall
have
wounding
you
hope
quietly
removed
her
earrings
and
the
tender
pair
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
in
one
another
arms
the
young
girl
tears
were
dried
and
hope
revived
and
life
bloomed
again
only
henceforth
her
longing
eyes
looked
out
to
sea
for
her
father
homeward
bound
next
day
as
they
were
seated
together
in
the
julia
came
from
the
window
with
a
rush
and
kneeled
at
dodd
knees
with
bright
imploring
face
upturned
he
is
there
and
i
am
to
speak
to
him
is
that
it
dear
dear
dear
mamma
was
the
somewhat
oblique
reply
well
then
bring
me
my
she
was
ten
minutes
putting
them
on
julia
tried
to
expedite
her
and
retarded
her
she
had
her
pace
and
could
not
go
beyond
it
now
by
this
time
alfred
hardie
was
thoroughly
miserable
unable
to
move
his
father
shunned
by
julia
sickened
by
what
he
had
heard
and
indeed
seen
of
her
gaiety
and
indifference
to
their
separation
stung
by
jealousy
and
fretted
by
impatience
he
was
drinking
nearly
all
the
bitters
of
that
sweet
passion
love
but
as
you
are
aware
he
ascribed
julia
inconstancy
lightness
and
cruelty
all
to
dodd
he
hated
her
cordially
and
dreaded
her
into
the
bargain
he
played
the
sentinel
about
her
door
all
the
more
because
she
had
asked
him
not
to
do
it
always
do
what
your
enemy
particularly
objects
to
said
he
applying
to
his
own
case
the
wisdom
of
a
greek
philosopher
one
of
his
teachers
so
when
the
gate
suddenly
opened
and
instead
of
julia
this
very
dodd
walked
towards
him
his
feelings
were
anything
but
enviable
he
wished
himself
away
heartily
but
was
too
proud
to
retreat
he
stood
his
ground
she
came
up
to
him
a
charming
smile
broke
out
over
her
features
ah
hardie
said
she
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
will
you
give
me
a
minute
he
assented
with
surprise
and
an
ill
grace
may
i
take
your
arm
he
offered
it
with
a
worse
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
it
and
it
shuddered
at
her
touch
he
felt
like
walking
with
a
velvet
tigress
by
some
instinct
she
divined
his
sentiment
and
found
her
task
more
difficult
than
she
had
thought
she
took
some
steps
in
silence
at
last
as
he
was
no
dissembler
he
burst
out
passionately
why
are
you
my
enemy
i
am
not
your
enemy
said
she
quietly
not
openly
but
all
the
more
dangerous
you
keep
us
apart
you
bid
her
be
gay
and
forget
me
you
are
a
cruel
no
i
am
not
sir
said
dodd
simply
oh
i
believe
you
are
good
and
kind
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
but
you
know
you
have
a
heart
of
iron
for
i
am
my
daughter
friend
but
not
your
enemy
it
is
you
who
are
too
inexperienced
to
know
how
delicate
how
difficult
my
duties
are
it
is
only
since
last
night
i
see
my
way
clear
and
look
i
come
at
once
to
you
with
friendly
intentions
suppose
i
were
as
impetuous
as
you
are
i
should
perhaps
be
calling
you
he
retorted
bitterly
give
me
something
to
be
grateful
for
and
you
shall
see
whether
that
baseness
is
in
my
i
have
a
great
mind
to
put
you
to
the
proof
said
she
archly
let
us
walk
down
this
lane
then
you
can
be
as
unjust
to
me
you
think
proper
without
attracting
public
in
the
lane
she
told
him
quietly
she
knew
the
nature
of
his
objections
to
the
alliance
he
had
so
much
at
heart
and
they
were
objections
which
her
husband
on
his
return
would
remove
on
this
he
changed
his
tone
a
little
and
implored
her
piteously
not
to
deceive
him
i
will
not
said
she
upon
my
honour
if
you
are
as
constant
as
my
daughter
is
in
her
esteem
for
you
notwithstanding
her
threadbare
gaiety
worn
over
loyal
regret
and
to
check
a
parcel
of
idle
tongues
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
and
everything
to
expect
come
may
i
take
that
liberty
with
you
let
us
understand
one
another
we
only
want
that
to
be
this
was
hard
to
resist
and
at
his
age
his
lip
trembled
he
hesitated
but
at
last
gave
her
his
hand
she
walked
two
hours
with
him
and
laid
herself
out
to
enlighten
soothe
and
comfort
his
sore
heart
his
hopes
and
happiness
revived
under
her
magic
as
julia
had
in
the
midst
of
it
all
the
wise
woman
quietly
made
terms
he
was
not
to
come
to
the
house
but
on
her
invitation
unless
indeed
he
had
news
of
the
to
communicate
but
he
might
write
once
a
week
to
her
and
enclose
a
few
lines
to
julia
on
this
concession
he
proceeded
to
mumble
her
white
wrist
and
call
her
his
best
dearest
loveliest
friend
his
mother
oh
remember
said
he
with
a
relic
of
distrust
you
are
the
only
mother
i
can
ever
hope
to
that
touched
her
hitherto
he
had
been
to
her
but
a
thing
her
daughter
loved
her
eyes
filled
my
poor
motherless
boy
she
said
pray
for
my
husband
safe
return
for
on
that
your
happiness
depends
and
hers
and
so
now
two
more
bright
eyes
looked
longingly
seaward
for
the
homeward
bound
chapter
vii
north
latitude
longitude
east
the
time
march
of
this
same
year
the
wind
southerly
the
port
whampoa
in
the
canton
river
ships
at
anchor
reared
their
tall
masts
here
and
there
and
the
broad
stream
was
enlivened
and
coloured
by
junks
and
boats
of
all
sizes
and
vivid
hues
propelled
on
the
screw
principle
by
a
great
scull
at
the
stern
with
projecting
handles
for
the
crew
to
work
and
at
times
a
gorgeous
mandarin
boat
with
two
great
glaring
eyes
set
in
the
bows
came
flying
rowed
with
forty
paddles
by
an
armed
crew
whose
shields
hung
on
the
gunwale
and
flashed
fire
in
the
sunbeams
the
mandarin
in
conical
and
buttoned
hat
sitting
on
the
top
of
his
cabin
calmly
smoking
paradise
opium
while
his
gong
boomed
and
his
boat
flew
fourteen
miles
an
hour
and
all
things
scuttled
out
of
his
celestial
way
and
there
looking
majestically
down
on
all
these
the
huge
cynosure
of
so
many
loving
eyes
and
loving
hearts
in
england
lay
at
her
moorings
homeward
bound
her
tea
not
being
yet
on
board
the
ship
hull
floated
high
as
a
castle
and
to
the
subtle
intellectual
people
that
sculled
to
and
fro
busy
as
bees
though
looking
forked
mushrooms
she
sounded
like
a
vast
musical
shell
for
a
lusty
harmony
of
many
mellow
voices
vibrated
in
her
great
cavities
and
made
the
air
ring
cheerily
around
her
the
vocalists
were
the
cyclops
to
judge
by
the
tremendous
thumps
that
kept
clean
time
to
their
sturdy
tune
yet
it
was
but
human
labour
so
heavy
and
so
knowing
that
it
had
called
in
music
to
help
it
was
the
third
mate
and
his
gang
completing
his
floor
to
receive
the
coming
yesterday
he
had
stowed
his
dunnage
many
hundred
bundles
of
light
flexible
canes
from
sumatra
and
malacca
on
these
he
had
laid
tons
of
rough
saltpetre
in
lb
and
was
now
mashing
it
to
music
bags
and
all
his
gang
of
fifteen
naked
to
the
waist
stood
in
line
with
huge
wooden
beetles
called
commanders
and
lifted
them
high
and
brought
them
down
on
the
nitre
in
cadence
with
true
nautical
power
and
unison
singing
as
follows
with
a
ponderous
bump
on
the
first
note
in
each
bar
music
notation
and
so
up
to
fifteen
when
the
stave
was
concluded
with
a
shrill
spell
oh
and
the
gang
relieved
streaming
with
perspiration
when
the
saltpetre
was
well
mashed
they
rolled
ton
on
it
till
the
floor
was
like
a
billiard
table
a
fleet
of
chop
boats
then
began
to
arrive
so
many
per
day
with
the
grey
proceeded
to
lay
the
first
tier
on
his
saltpetre
floor
and
then
built
the
chests
tier
upon
tier
beginning
at
the
sides
and
leaving
in
the
middle
a
lane
somewhat
narrower
than
a
then
he
applied
a
screw
jack
to
the
chests
on
both
sides
and
so
enlarged
his
central
aperture
and
forced
the
remaining
in
and
behold
the
enormous
cargo
packed
as
tight
as
ever
shopkeeper
packed
a
box
nineteen
thousand
eight
hundred
and
six
chests
sixty
half
chests
fifty
quarter
chests
while
grey
was
contemplating
his
work
with
singular
satisfaction
a
small
boat
from
canton
came
alongside
and
tickell
midshipman
ran
up
the
side
skipped
on
the
quarterdeck
saluted
it
first
and
then
the
first
mate
and
gave
him
a
line
from
the
captain
desiring
him
to
take
the
ship
down
to
second
bar
for
her
water
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
two
hours
after
receipt
of
this
order
the
ship
swung
to
the
ebb
instantly
sharpe
unmoored
and
the
began
her
famous
voyage
with
her
head
at
right
angles
to
her
course
for
the
wind
being
foul
all
sharpe
could
do
was
to
set
his
topsails
driver
and
jib
and
keep
her
in
the
tide
way
and
clear
of
the
numerous
craft
by
backing
or
filling
as
the
case
required
which
he
did
with
considerable
dexterity
making
the
sails
steer
the
helm
for
the
nonce
he
crossed
the
bar
at
sunset
and
brought
to
with
the
best
bower
anchor
in
five
fathoms
and
a
half
here
they
began
to
take
in
their
water
and
on
the
fifth
day
the
gig
was
ordered
up
to
canton
for
the
captain
the
next
afternoon
he
passed
the
ship
in
her
going
down
the
river
to
to
board
the
chinese
admiral
for
his
chop
or
permission
to
leave
china
all
night
the
showed
three
lights
at
her
mizen
peak
for
him
and
kept
a
sharp
look
out
but
he
did
not
come
he
was
having
a
very
serious
talk
with
the
chinese
admiral
at
daybreak
however
the
gig
was
reported
in
sight
sharpe
told
one
of
the
midshipmen
to
call
the
boatswain
and
man
the
side
soon
the
gig
ran
alongside
two
of
the
ship
boys
jumped
like
monkeys
over
the
bulwarks
lighting
one
on
the
main
channels
the
other
on
the
midship
port
and
put
the
side
ropes
assiduously
in
the
captain
hands
he
bestowed
a
slight
paternal
smile
on
them
the
first
the
imps
had
ever
received
from
an
officer
and
went
lightly
up
the
sides
the
moment
his
foot
touched
the
deck
the
boatswain
gave
a
frightful
shrill
whistle
the
men
at
the
sides
uncovered
the
captain
saluted
the
and
all
the
officers
saluted
him
which
he
returned
and
stepping
for
a
moment
to
the
weather
side
of
his
deck
gave
the
loud
command
all
hands
heave
he
then
directed
sharpe
to
get
what
sail
he
could
on
the
ship
the
wind
being
now
westerly
and
dived
into
his
cabin
the
boatswain
piped
three
shrill
pipes
and
all
hands
up

was
thrice
repeated
forward
followed
by
private
admonitions

sixty
fine

walked
the

she
had
been
to

health
intending
to
return
to
calcutta
but
meantime
her
husband
was
made
a
director
and
went
home
so
she
was
going
to
join
him
a
tall
handsome
lady
with
too
curved
a
nose
like
most
aquiline
women
she
was
born
to
domineer
a
bit
and
for
the
last
ten
years
orientals
clinging
at
her
knee
and
europeans
flattering
at
her
ear
had
nursed
this
quality
high
and
spoiled
her
with
all
their
might
a
similar
process
had
been
applied
to
her
boy
frederick
from
infancy
he
was
now
nearly
six
arrogance
and
caprice
shone
so
in
both
their
sallow
faces
and
spoke
so
in
every
gesture
that
as
they
came
on

sharpe
a
reader
of

whispered
the

bayliss
fullalove
was

some

fullalove
was
one
of
the
extraordinary
products
of
an
extraordinary
nation
the
united
states
of
america
he
was
an
engineer
for
one
thing
and
an
inventive
and
practical
mechanician
held
two
patents
of
his
own
creating
which
yielded
him
a
good
income
both
at
home
and
in
great
britain
such
results
are
seldom
achieved
without
deep
study
and
seclusion
and
accordingly
joshua
fullalove
when
the
inventive
fit
was
on
would
be
buried
deep
as
archimedes
for
a
twelvemonth
burning
the
midnight
oil
then
his
active
element
predominating
the
pale
student
would
dash
into
the
forest
or
the
prairie
with
a
rifle
and
an
indian
and
come
out
bronzed
and
more
or
less
or
thence
invariably
to

for
a
year
or
two
there
to
the
backbone
his
romance
had
ever
an
eye
to
business
he
was
always
after
foreign
mechanical
inventions
he
was
now
importing
a
excellent
one
from
japan
and
ready
to
do
lucrative
feats
of
knowledge
thus
he
bought
a
turkish
ship
at
the
bottom
of
the
dardanelles
for
twelve
hundred
dollars
raised
her
cargo
hardware
and
sold
it
for
six
thousand
dollars
then
weighed
the
empty
ship
pumped
her
repaired
he
and
navigated
her
himself
into
boston
harbour
massachusetts
on
the
way
he
rescued
with
his
late
drowned
ship
a
swedish
vessel
and
received
salvage
he
once
fished
eighty
elephants
tusks
out
of
a
craft
foundered
in
the

to
the
disgust
of
elder
looking
on

these
unusual
pursuits
were
varied
by
a
singular
recreation
he
played
at
elevating
the
african
character
to
european
levels
with
this
view
he
had
bought

the

came
curtseying
round
to

southward
spread
her
snowy
pinions
high
and
wide
and
went
like
a
bird
over
the
wrinkled
sea
homeward
bound
it
was
an
exhilarating
start
and
all
faces
were
bright
but
one
the
captain
looked
somewhat
grave
and
thoughtful
and
often
scanned
the
horizon
with
his
glass
he
gave
polite
but
very
short
answers
to
his
friend
colonel
kenealy
who
was
firing
nothings
in
his
ear
and
sent
for
the
gunner
while
that
personage
a
crusty
old

called

is
cleaning
himself
to

on
the
peep
we
into
captain
dodd
troubled
mind
and
into
the
circumstances
which
connect
him
with
the
heart
of
this
story
despite
the
twelve
thousand
miles
of
water
between
him
and
the
lovers
at
barkington
it
had
always
been
his
pride
to
lay
by
money
for
his
wife
and
children
and
under
advice
of
an
indian
friend
he
had
during
the
last
few
years
placed
considerable
sums
at
intervals
in
a
great
calcutta
house
which
gave
eight
per
cent
for
deposits
swelled
by
fresh
capital
and
such
high
interest
the
hoard
grew
fast
when
his
old
ship
sore
battered
off
the
cape
was
condemned
by
the
company
agents
at
canton
he
sailed
to
calcutta
intending
to
return
thence
to
england
as
a
passenger
but
while
he
was
at
calcutta
the
greatest
firm
there
suspended
payment
carrying
astonishment
and
dismay
into
a
hundred
families
at
such
moments
the
press
and
the
fireside
ring
for
a
little
while
with
the
cry
good
interest
means
bad
as
for
dodd
who
till
then
had
revered
all
these
great
houses
with
nautical
or
childlike
confidence
a
blind
terror
took
the
place
of
blind
trust
in
him
he
felt
guilty
towards
his
children
for
risking
their
money
he
had
got
to
believe
it
was
theirs
not
his
and
vowed
if
he
could
only
get
hold
of
it
once
more
he
would
never
trust
a
penny
of
it
out
of
his
own
hands
again
except
perhaps
to
the
bank
of
england
but
should
he
ever
get
it
it
was
a
large
sum
he
went
to
anderson
anderson
and
drew
for
his
fourteen
thousand
pounds
to
his
dismay
but
hardly
to
his
surprise
the
clerks
looked
at
one
another
and
sent
the
cheque
into
some
inner
department
dodd
was
kept
waiting
his
heart
sank
with
him
there
was
a
hitch
duke
of
wellington
the
iron
one
is
the
author
of
this
saying
meantime
came
a
government
officer
and
paid
in
an
enormous
sum
in
notes
and
mercantile
bills
principally
the
latter
presently
dodd
was
invited
into
the
manager
room
leaving
the
country
captain
dodd
yes
you
had
better
take
some
of
your
money
in
bills
at
sight
on
i
would
rather
have
notes
sir
faltered
dodd
oh
bills
by
oliveira
upon
baring
are
just
as
good
even
without
our
endorsement
however
you
can
have
half
and
half
calcutta
does
but
little
in
english
you
they
gave
him
his
money
the
bills
were
all
manifestly
good
but
he
recognised
one
of
them
as
having
just
been
paid
in
by
the
civilian
he
found
himself
somehow
safe
in
the
street
clutching
the
cash
with
one
half
of
his
great
paternal
heart
on
fire
and
the
other
half
freezing
he
had
rescued
his
children
fortune
but
he
had
seen
destruction
graze
it
the
natural
chill
at
being
scraped
by
peril
soon
passed
the
triumphant
glow
remained
the
next
sentiment
was
precaution
he
filled
with
it
to
the
brim
he
went
and
bought
a
great
broad
with
a
key
to
it
though
he
was
on
dry
land
he
covered
it
with
oiled
silk
against
the
water
and
sewed
the
whole
thing
to
his
flannel
waistcoat
and
felt
for
it
with
his
hand
a
hundred
times
a
day
the
fruit
of
his
own
toil
his
children
hoard
the
rescued
treasure
he
was
to
have
the
joy
of
bringing
home
safe
to
the
dear
partner
of
all
his
joys
unexpectedly
he
was
ordered
out
to
canton
to
sail
the
to
the
cape
then
a
novel
and
strange
feeling
came
over
him
like
a
cloud
that
feeling
was
a
sense
of
personal
danger
not
that
the
many
perils
of
the
deep
were
new
to
him
he
had
faced
them
this
years
but
till
now
they
were
little
present
to
his
imagination
they
used
to
come
be
encountered
be
gone
but
now
though
absent
they
darkened
the
way
it
was
the
the
material
treasure
the
hard
cash
which
had
lately
set
him
in
a
glow
seemed
now
to
load
his
chest
and
hang
heavy
round
the
neck
of
his
heart
sailors
are
more
or
less
superstitious
and
men
are
creatures
of
habit
even
in
their
courage
now
david
had
never
gone
to
sea
with
a
lot
of
money
on
him
before
as
he
was
a
man
these
vague
forebodings
would
perhaps
have
cleared
away
with
the
bustle
when
the
set
her
studding
sails
off
macao
but
for
a
piece
of
positive
intelligence
he
had
picked
up
at
the
chinese
admiral
had
warned
him
of
a
pirate
a
daring
pirate
who
had
been
lately
cruising
in
these
waters
first
heard
of
south
the
line
but
had
since
taken
a
russian
ship
at
the
very
mouth
of
the
canton
river
murdered
the
crew
in
sight
of
land
and
sold
the
women
for
slaves
or
worse
dodd
asked
for
particulars
was
he
a
ladroner
a
malay
a
bornese
in
what
latitude
was
he
to
be
looked
for
the
admiral
on
this
examined
his
memoranda
by
these
it
appeared
little
was
known
as
yet
about
the
miscreant
except
that
he
never
cruised
long
on
one
ground
the
crew
was
a
mixed
one
the
captain
was
believed
to
be
a
portuguese
and
to
have
a
consort
commanded
by
his
brother
but
this
was
doubtful
at
all
events
the
pair
had
never
been
seen
at
work
together
the
gunner
arrived
and
saluted
the
the
captain
on
this
saluted
him
and
beckoned
him
to
the
weather
side
on
this
the
other
officers
kept
religiously
to
leeward
mr
monk
said
dodd
you
will
clean
and
prepare
all
the
small
arms
ay
ay
sir
said
the
old
niler
with
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
how
many
of
your
are
serviceable
this
simple
question
stirred
up
in
one
moment
all
the
bile
in
the
poor
old
gentleman
nature
my
serviceable
how
the
they
when
that
son
of
a
your
third
mate
has
been
and
lashed
the
water
butts
to
their
breechings
and
jammed
his
gear
in
between
their
nozzles
till
they
ca
breathe
poor
things
far
less
bark
i
wish
was
lashed
between
the
devil
with
a
red
hot
cable
as
tight
as
he
has
jammed
my
guns
be
so
good
as
not
to
swear
monk
said
dodd
at
your
age
sir
i
look
to
you
to
set
an
example
to
the
petty
well
i
wo
swear
no
more
sir
d
d
if
i
do
he
added
very
loudly
and
with
a
seeming
access
of
ire
and
i
ax
your
pardon
captain
and
the
when
a
man
has
a
deep
anxiety
some
human
midge
or
mosquito
buzzes
at
him
it
is
a
rule
to
dodd
heavy
with
responsibility
and
a
dark
misgiving
he
must
not
communicate
came
delicately
and
by
degrees
and
with
a
semigenuflexion
every
three
steps
one
like
a
magpie
and
putting
his
hands
together
as
our
children
do
to
approach
the
almighty
delivered
himself
thus
in
modulated
tones
and
good
hindostanee
the
daughter
of
light
in
whose
beams
i
ramgolam
bask
glows
with
an
amicable
desire
to
see
the
lord
commander
of
the
ship
resembling
a
mountain
and
to
make
a
taught
by
sad
experience
how
weighty
are
the
communications
the
daughters
of
light
pour
into
nautical
commanders
at
sea
dodd
hailed
tickell
a
midshipman
and
sent
him
down
to
the
lady
cabin
tickell
soon
came
back
reddish
but
grinning
to
say
that
nothing
less
than
the
captain
would
do
dodd
sighed
and
dismissed
monk
with
a
promise
to
inspect
the
himself
then
went
down
to
beresford
and
found
her
indignant
why
had
he
stopped
the
ship
miles
and
miles
from
macao
and
given
her
the
trouble
and
annoyance
of
a
voyage
in
that
nasty
little
boat
dodd
opened
his
great
brown
eyes
why
madam
it
is
shoal
water
off
macao
we
dare
not
come
no
evasion
sir
what
have
i
to
do
with
your
shoal
water
it
was
laziness
and
want
of
consideration
for
a
lady
who
has
rented
half
your
nothing
of
the
kind
madam
i
assure
are
you
the
person
they
call
gentleman
dodd
then
do
contradict
a
lady
or
i
shall
take
the
liberty
to
dispute
your
dodd
took
no
notice
of
this
and
with
a
patience
few
nautical
commanders
would
have
shown
endeavoured
to
make
her
see
that
he
was
obliged
to
give
macao
shoals
a
wide
berth
or
cast
away
the
ship
she
would
not
see
it
when
dodd
saw
she
wanted
not
an
explanation
but
a
grievance
he
ceased
to
thwart
her
i
am
neglecting
my
duties
to
no
purpose
said
he
and
left
her
without
ceremony
this
was
a
fresh
offence
and
as
he
went
out
she
declared
open
war
and
she
made
it
too
from
that
hour
a
war
of
pins
and
needles
dodd
went
on
the
and
found
that
the
defence
of
the
ship
had
as
usual
in
these
peaceful
days
been
sacrificed
to
the
cargo
out
of
twenty
she
carried
on
that
deck
he
cleared
three
and
that
with
difficulty
to
clear
any
more
he
must
have
sacrificed
either
merchandise
or
water
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
do
either
on
the
mere
chance
of
a
danger
so
unusual
as
an
encounter
with
a
pirate
he
was
a
merchant
captain
not
a
warrior
meantime
the
had
already
shown
him
great
sailing
qualities
the
log
was
hove
at
sundown
and
gave
eleven
knots
so
that
with
a
good
breeze
abaft
few
rigged
pirates
could
overhaul
her
and
this
wind
carried
her
swiftly
past
one
nest
of
them
at
all
events
the
ladrone
isles
at
nine
all
the
lights
were
ordered
out
beresford
had
brought
a
novel
on
board
and
refused
to
comply
the
insisted
she
threatened
him
with
the
vengeance
of
the
company
the
premier
and
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
the
british
realm
the
finding
he
had
no
chance
in
argument
doused
the
glim
pitiable
resource
of
a
weak
disputant
then
basely
fled
the
rhetorical
consequences
the
northerly
breeze
died
out
and
light
variable
winds
baffled
the
ship
it
was
the
april
ere
she
passed
the
macclesfield
bank
in
latitude
and
now
they
sailed
for
many
days
out
of
sight
of
land
dodd
chest
expanded
his
main
anxiety
at
this
part
of
the
voyage
lay
in
the
state
cabin
of
all
the
perils
of
the
sea
none
shakes
a
sailor
like
fire
he
set
a
watch
day
and
night
on
that
spoiled
child
on
the
may
they
passed
the
great
nantuna
and
got
among
the
bornese
and
malay
islands
at
which
the
captain
glass
began
to
sweep
the
horizon
again
and
night
and
day
at
the
dizzy
foretop
gallant
he
perched
an
eye
they
crossed
the
line
in
longitude
with
a
slight
breeze
but
soon
fell
into
the
doldrums
a
dead
calm
and
nothing
to
do
but
kill
time
dodd
had
put
down
neptune
that
old
blackguard
could
no
longer
row
out
on
the
ship
port
side
and
board
her
on
the
starboard
pretending
to
come
from
ocean
depths
and
shave
the
novices
with
a
rusty
hoop
and
dab
a
soapy
brush
in
their
mouths
but
champagne
popped
the
sexes
flirted
and
the
sailors
span
fathomless
yarns
and
danced
rattling
hornpipes
fiddled
to
by
the
grave
fullalove
if
there
is
a
thing
i
dew
it
fiddle
said
he
he
and
his
friend
as
he
systematically
called
vespasian
taught
the
crew
yankee
steps
and
were
beloved
one
honest
saltatory
british
tar
offered
that
western
pair
his
grog
for
a
week
even
beresford
emerged
and
walked
the
deck
quenching
her
austere
regards
with
a
familiar
smile
on
colonel
kenealy
her
escort
this
gallant
soldier
flattered
her
to
the
nine
and
finding
her
sweeten
with
his
treacle
tried
to
reconcile
her
to
his
old
friend
dodd
straight
she
soured
and
forbade
the
topic
imperiously
by
this
time
the
mates
and
midshipmen
of
the
had
fathomed
their
captain
tickell
delivered
the
mind
of
the
united
midshipmen
when
he
proposed
dodd
health
in
their
as
a
navigator
a
mathematician
a
seaman
a
gentleman
and
a
brick
with
three
times
dodd
never
spoke
to
his
officers
like
a
ruffian
nor
yet
palavered
them
but
he
had
a
very
pleasant
way
of
conveying
appreciation
of
an
zeal
by
a
knowing
nod
with
a
kindly
smile
on
the
heels
of
it
as
for
the
men
they
seldom
came
in
contact
with
the
captain
of
a
ship
this
crew
only
knew
him
at
first
as
a
soul
who
did
bother
about
nothing
but
one
day
as
they
lay
becalmed
south
of
the
line
a
jolly
foretopman
came
on
the
with
a
fid
of
soup
and
saluting
and
scraping
first
to
the
deck
then
to
the
captain
asked
him
if
he
would
taste
that
yes
my
man
smoked
like
and
blazes
your
honour
axing
your
pardon
and
the
young
gentleman
said
dodd
to
meredith
a
midshipman
be
so
good
as
to
send
the
cook
the
cook
came
and
received
not
an
oath
nor
a
threat
but
a
remonstrance
and
a
grim
warning
in
the
teeth
of
this
he
burnt
the
soup
horribly
the
very
next
day
the
crew
sent
the
lucky
foretopman
aft
again
he
made
his
scrape
and
presented
his
fid
the
captain
tasted
the
soup
and
sent
grey
to
bid
the
boatswain
mate
pipe
the
hands
on
deck
and
bring
the
cook
aft
quartermaster
unsling
a
and
fill
it
from
the
men
kids
tickell
see
the
cook
swallow
his
own
mess
bosen
mate
take
a
bight
of
the
flying
jib
sheet
stand
over
him
and
start
him
if
he
dailies
with
with
this
the
captain
went
below
and
the
cook
supping
at
the
bucket
delivered
himself
as
follows
well
ye
lubbers
it
is
first
rate
no

oh

avast
cried
the
captain
reappearing
and
the
uplifted
rope
fell
harmless
silence
fore
and
aft
pipe
the
cook
has
received
a
light
punishment
this
time
for
spoiling
the
men
mess
my
crew
shall
eat
nothing
i
ca

double

the

bosen
pipe
shipmates
listen
to
me
said
the
foretopman
this
old
is
a
d
d
com
for
table
the
oracular
sentence
was
hailed
with
a
ringing
cheer
still
it
is
unlucky
the
british
seaman
is
so
enamoured
of
theological
terms
for
he
constantly
misapplies
them
after
lying
a
week
like
a
dead
log
on
the
calm
but
heaving
waters
came
a
few
light
puffs
in
the
upper
air
and
inflated
the
topsails
only
the
ship
crawled
southward
the
crew
whistling
for
wind
at
last
one
afternoon
it
began
to
rain
and
after
the
rain
came
a
gale
from
the
eastward
the
watchful
skipper
saw
it
purple
the
water
to
windward
and
ordered
the
topsails
to
be
reefed
and
the
lee
ports
closed
this
last
order
seemed
an
excess
of
precaution
but
dodd
was
not
yet
thoroughly
acquainted
with
his
ship
qualities
and
the
hard
cash
round
his
neck
made
him
cautious
the
lee
ports
were
closed
all
but
one
and
that
was
lowered
grey
was
working
a
problem
in
his
cabin
and
wanted
a
little
light
and
a
little
air
so
he
just
drooped
his
port
but
not
to
deviate
from
the
spirit
of
his
captain
instructions
he
fastened
a
tackle
to
it
that
he
might
have
mechanical
force
to
close
it
with
should
the
ship
lie
over
down
came
the
gale
with
a
whoo
and
made
all
crack
the
ship
lay
over
pretty
much
and
the
sea
poured
in
at
grey
port
he
applied
his
purchase
to
close
it
but
though
his
tackle
gave
him
the
force
of
a
dozen
hands
he
might
as
well
have
tried
to
move
a
mountain
on
the
contrary
the
tremendous
sea
rushed
in
and
burst
the
port
wide
open
grey
after
a
vain
struggle
with
its
might
shrieked
for
help
down
tumbled
the
nearest
hands
and
hauled
on
the
tackle
in
vain
destruction
was
rushing
on
the
ship
and
on
them
first
but
meantime
the
captain
with
a
shrewd
guess
at
the
general
nature
of
the
danger
he
could
not
see
had
roared
out
slack
the
main
the
ship
righted
and
the
port
came
flying
to
and
men
breathed
hard
up
to
their
waists
in
water
and
floating
boxes
grey
barred
the
unlucky
port
and
went
aft
drenched
in
body
and
wretched
in
mind
to
report
his
own
fault
he
found
the
captain
looking
grim
as
death
he
told
him
almost
crying
what
he
had
done
and
how
he
had
miscalculated
the
power
of
the
water
dodd
looked
and
saw
his
distress
let
it
be
a
lesson
sir
said
he
sternly
how
many
ships
have
been
lost
by
this
in
fair
weather
and
not
a
man
saved
to
tell
how
the
craft
was
fooled
away
captain
bid
me
fling
myself
over
the
side
and
i
do
hummph
i
afraid
i
ca
afford
to
lose
a
good
officer
for
a
fault
he
will
never
repeat
it
blew
hard
all
night
and
till
twelve
the
next
day
the
showed
her
weak
point
she
rolled
abominably
a
dirty
night
came
on
at
eight
bells
grey
touched
by
dodd
clemency
and
brimful
of
zeal
reported
a
light
in
beresford
cabin
it
had
been
put
out
as
usual
by
the
but
the
refractory
one
had
relighted
it
go
and
take
it
away
said
dodd
soon
screams
were
heard
from
the
cabin
oh
mercy
mercy
i
will
not
be
drowned
in
the
dodd
who
had
kept
clear
of
her
so
long
went
down
and
tried
to
reassure
her
oh
the
tempest
the
tempest
she
cried
and
to
be
drowned
in
the
dark
tempest
it
is
blowing
half
a
gale
of
wind
that
is
half
a
gale
ah
that
is
the
way
you
always
talk
to
us
ladies
oh
pray
give
me
my
light
and
send
me
a
dodd
took
pity
and
let
her
have
her
light
with
a
midshipman
to
watch
it
he
even
made
her
a
hypocritical
promise
that
should
there
be
one
grain
of
danger
he
would
lie
to
but
said
he
must
not
make
a
foul
wind
of
a
fair
one
for
a
few
lee
lurches
the
broke
plenty
of
glass
and
crockery
though
with
her
fair
wind
and
her
lee
lurches
wind
down
at
noon
next
day
and
a
dead
calm
at
two
the
weather
cleared
the
sun
came
out
high
in
centre
and
a
balmy
breeze
from
the
west
at
six
the
grand
orb
set
calm
and
red
and
the
sea
was
gorgeous

the

sparkled

splashes

flew
and
settled
on

the

the

and
with

being
so

came
majestically
a

and
set

instantly
the

the

below
strange

right
ahead
the
strange
sail
was
reported
to
captain
dodd
then
dressing
in
his
cabin
he
came
soon
after
on
deck
and
hailed
the
lookout
which
way
is
she
standing
ca
say
sir
ca
see
her
move
dodd
ordered
the
boatswain
to
pipe
to
breakfast
and
taking
his
deck
glass
went
lightly
up
to
the
crosstrees
thence
through
the
light
haze
of
a
glorious
morning
he
espied
a
long
low
schooner
lying
close
under
point
leat
a
small
island
about
nine
miles
distant
on
the
weather
bow
and
nearly
in
the
course
then
approaching
the
straits
of
gaspar
latitude
she
is
said
dodd
very
gravely
at
eight
the
stranger
lay
about
two
miles
to
windward
and
still
by
this
time
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
her
and
half
a
dozen
glasses
everybody
except
the
captain
delivered
an
opinion
she
was
a
greek
for
water
she
was
a
malay
coming
north
with
canes
and
short
of
hands
she
was
a
pirate
watching
the
straits
the
captain
leaned
silent
and
sombre
with
his
arms
on
the
bulwarks
and
watched
the
suspected
craft
fullalove
joined
the
group
and
levelled
a
powerful
glass
of
his
own
construction
his
inspection
was
long
and
minute
and
while
the
glass
was
at
his
eye
sharpe
asked
him
half
in
a
whisper
could
he
make
out
anything
wal
said
he
the
varmint
looks
considerable
then
without
removing
his
glass
he
let
drop
a
word
at
a
time
as
if
the
facts
were
trickling
into
his
telescope
at
the
lens
and
out
at
the
sight
one
two

false
there
was
a
momentary
murmur
among
the
officers
all
round
but
british
sailors

undemonstrative
colonel
kenealy
strolling
the
deck
with
his
cigar
saw
they
were
watching
another
ship
with
maritime
curiosity
and
making
comments
but
he
discerned
no
particular
emotion
nor
anxiety
in
what
they
said
nor
in
the
grave
low
tones
they
said
it
in
perhaps
a
brother
seaman
would
though
the
next
observation
that
trickled
out
of
fullalove
tube
was
this
i
judge
there
are
too
few
hands
on
deck
and
too
many
white
eyeballs
glittering
at
the
confound
it
muttered
bayliss
uneasily
how
can
you
see
that
fullalove
replied
only
by
quietly
handing
his
glass
to
dodd
the
captain
thus
appealed
to
glued
his
eye
to
the
tube
well
sir
see
the
false
ports
and
the
white
eyebrows
asked
sharpe
ironically
i
see
this
is
the
best
glass
i
ever
looked
through
said
dodd
doggedly
without
interrupting
his
inspection
i
think
he
is
a
malay
pirate
said
grey
sharpe
took
him
up
very
quickly
and
indeed
angrily
nonsense
and
if
he
is
he
wo
venture
on
a
craft
of
this
says
the
whale
to
the
swordfish
suggested
fullalove
with
a
little
guttural
laugh
the
captain
with
the
american
glass
at
his
eye
turned
half
round
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
starboard
starboard
it
steer
ay
ay
and
the
ship
course
was
thus
altered
two
points
this
order
lowered
dodd
fifty
per
cent
in
sharpe
estimation
he
held
his
tongue
as
long
as
he
could
but
at
last
his
surprise
and
dissatisfaction
burst
out
of
him
wo
that
bring
him
out
on
us
very
likely
sir
replied
dodd
begging
your
pardon
captain
would
it
not
be
wiser
to
keep
our
course
and
show
the
blackguard
we
do
fear
him
when
we
sharpe
he
has
made
up
his
mind
an
hour
ago
whether
to
lie
still
or
bite
my
changing
my
course
two
points
wo
change
his
mind
but
it
may
make
him
declare
it
and
must
know
what
he
does
intend
before
i
run
the
ship
into
the
narrows
oh
i
see
said
sharpe
half
convinced
the
alteration
in
the
course
produced
no
movement
on
the
part
of
the
mysterious
schooner
she
under

still
and
with
only
a

on

while
the
edged
away
from
her
and
entered

about
two

amongst
the

of
human
reasoning
is
this
one
forms
a
judgment
on
certain
statements
they
turn
out
incorrect
yet
the
judgment
sound
this
occurs
oftenest
when
to
divine
what
any
known
person
will
do
in
a
case
stated
we
go
boldly
by
his
character
his

or
his

great
forces
towards
which
men
gravitate
through
various
and
even
contrary
circumstances
now
women
sitting
at

out

way
are
somewhat
forced
as
well
as
naturally
inclined
to
rely
on
their
insight
into
character
and
by
this
broad
clue
often
pass
through
false
or
discoloured
data
to
a
sound
calculation
thus
it
was
dodd
applied
her
native
sagacity
to
divine
why
richard
hardie
declined
julia
for
his
son
wife
and
how
to
make
him
withdraw
that
dissent
and
the
fair
diviner
was
much
mistaken
in
detail
but
right
in
her
conclusion
for
richard
hardie
at
that
moment
the
unlikeliest
man
in
barkington
to
decline
julia
dodd
with
hard
cash
in
five
figures
for
his
i
am
now
about
to
make
a
revelation
to
the

that
will
incidentally
lead
him

by
a
different
path
the
outline
she
gave
her
daughter
and
my
reader
of

and
prudent
youth
was
substantially
correct
but
something
had
occurred
since

to

all

the

blown
a
respectable
bubble
about
two
hundred

fifty
years

prejudice
stronger
than

kept
them
down
and
the
wooden
ones
in

for
some
thirty
years
then
iron
prevailed
meantime
a
much
greater
invention
had
been
creeping
up

but
hardie
who
knew
that
the
collapse
had
been
merely
hastened
saw
the
gravity
of
the
situation
and
sold
largely
at
a
heavy
loss
but
he
could
not
sell
all
the
bad
paper
he
had
accumulated
for
a
temporary
purpose
the
panic
came
too
swiftly
and
too
strong
soon
there
were
no
buyers
at
any
price
the
biter
was
bit
the
fox
who
had
said
this
is
a
trap
i
lightly
come
and
lightly
go
was
caught
by
the
light
fantastic
toe
in
this
emergency
he
showed
high
qualities
vast
financial
ability
great
fortitude
and
that
sense
of
commercial
honour
which
dodd
justly
called
his
sentiment
he
mustered
all
his
private
resources
to
meet
his
engagements
and
maintain
his
high
position
then
commenced
a
long
and
steady
struggle
conducted
with
a
spartan
dignity
and
and
a
countenance
as
close
as
wax
little
did
any
in
barkington
guess
the
doubts
and
fears
the
hopes
and
despondencies
which
agitated
and
tore
the
heart
and
brain
that
schemed
and
throbbed
and
glowed
and
sickened
by
turns
beneath
that
steady
modulated
exterior
and
so
for
months
and
months
he
secretly
battled
with
insolvency
sometimes
it
threatened
in
the
distance
sometimes
at
hand
but
never
caught
him
unawares
he
provided
for
each
coming
danger
he
encountered
each
immediate
attack
but
not
unscathed
in
morals
just
as
matters
looked
brighter
came
a
concentration
of
liabilities
he
could
not
meet
without
emptying
his
tills
and
so
incurring
the
most
frightful
danger
of
all
he
had
provided
for
its
coming
too
but
a
decline
greater
than
he
had
reckoned
on
in
the
value
of
his
good
securities
made
that
provision
inadequate
then
it
was
he
committed
a
he
was
one
of
his
own
children
trustees
and
the
other
two
signed
after
him
like
machines
he
said
to
himself
my
honour
is
my
children
my
position
is
worth
thousands
i
have
sacrificed
a
fortune
to
preserve
it
it
would
be
madness
to
recoil
he
borrowed
three
thousand
pounds
of
the
trust
money
and
soon
after
two
thousand
more
it
kept
him
above
water
but
the
peril
and
the
escape
on
such
terms
left
him
gasping
inwardly
at
last
when
even
his
granite
nature
was
almost
worn
down
with
labour
anxiety
and
struggling
all
alone
without
a
word
of
comfort
for
the
price
of
one
grain
of
sympathy
would
have
been
destruction
he
shuffled
off
his
iron
burden
and
breathed
again
one
day
he
spent
in
a
sort
of
pleasing
lethargy
like
a
strong
swimmer
who
long
and
sore
buffeted
by
the
waves
has
reached
the
shore
at
last
the
next
day
his
cashier
a
old
man
called
young
skinner
invited
his
attention
rather
significantly
to
the
high
amount
of
certain
balances
compared
with
the
cash
at
his
skinner
disposal
indeed
said
hardie
quietly
that
must
be
he
added
graciously
as
if
conferring
a
great
favour
i
look
into
the
books
myself
he
did
more
he
sat
up
all
night
over
the
books
and
his
heart
died
with
him
bankruptcy
seemed
coming
towards
him
slow
perhaps
but
sure
and
meantime
to
live
with
the
sword
hanging
over
him
by
a
hair
soon
matters
approached
a
crisis
several
large
drafts
were
drawn
which
would
have
cleaned
the
bank
out
but
that
the
yearly
rents
of
a
wealthy
nobleman
had
for
some
days
past
been
flowing
in
this
nobleman
had
gone
to
explore
syria
and
assyria
he
was
a
great
traveller
who
contrived
to
live
up
to
his
income
at
home
but
had
never
been
able
to
spend
a
quarter
of
it
abroad
for
want
of
enemies
and
masters
better
known
as
friends
and
servants
to
help
him
so
hardie
was
safe
for
some
months
unless
there
should
be
an
extraordinary
run
on
him
and
that
was
not
likely
this
year
the
panic
had
subsided
and
bene
his
credit
had
never
stood
higher
the
reason
was
he
had
been
had
always
spoken
against
railways
and
his
wise
words
were
public
whereas
his
fatal
acts
had
been
done
in
the
dark
but
now
came
a
change
a
bitter
revulsion
over
this
tossed
mind
hope
and
patience
failed
at
last
and
his
virtue
being
a
thing
of
habit
and
traditions
rather
than
of
the
soul
wore
out
nay
more
this
man
who
had
sacrificed
so
nobly
to
commercial
integrity
was
filled
with
hate
of
his
idol
and
contempt
of
himself
idiot
said
he
to
throw
away
a
fortune
fighting
for
honour
a
greater
bubble
than
that
which
has
ruined
me
instead
of
breaking
like
a
man
with
a
hidden
purse
and
starting
fair
again
as
sensible
traders
no
honest
man
in
the
country
that
year
repented
of
his
vices
so
sincerely
as
richard
hardie
loathed
his
virtue
and
he
did
not
confine
his
penitence
to
sentiment
he
began
to
spend
his
days
at
the
bank
poring
over
the
books
and
to
lay
out
his
arithmetical
genius
in
a
subtle
process
that
should
enable
him
by
degrees
to
withdraw
a
few
thousands
from
human
eyes
for
his
future
use
despite
the
feeble
safeguards
of
the
existing
law
in
other
words
richard
hardie
like
thousands
before
him
was
fabricating
and
maturing
a
false
one
man
in
his
time
plays
many
animals
hardie
at
this
period
turned
mole
he
burrowed
darkling
into
there
is
often
one
of
these
sleek
miners
in
a
bank
it
is
a
section
of
human
zoology
the
journals
have
lately
enlarged
on
and
drawn
the
painstaking
creature
grubbing
and
mining
away
to
brief
opulence
and
briefer
penal
servitude
than
one
could
wish
i
rely
on
my
reader
having
read
these
really
able
sketches
of
my
contemporaries
and
spare
him
minute
details
that
possess
scarcely
a
new
feature
except
one
in
that
bank
was
not
only
a
mole
but
a
and
contrary
to
custom
the
mole
was
the
master
the
the
servant
the
latter
had
no
hostile
views
far
from
it
he
was
rather
attached
to
his
master
but
his
attention
was
roused
by
the
youngest
clerk
a
boy
of
sixteen
being
so
often
sent
for
into
the
bank
parlour
to
copy
into
the
books
some
arithmetical
result
without
its
process
attention
soon
became
suspicion
and
suspicion
found
many
little
things
to
feed
on
till
it
grew
to
certainty
but
the
outer
world
was
none
the
wiser
the
was
no
chatterbox
he
was
a
solitary
man
no
wife
nor
mistress
about
him
and
he
revered
the
mole
and
liked
him
better
than
anything
in
the
world
thus
the
great
banker
stood
a
colossus
of
wealth
and
stability
to
the
eye
though
ready
to
crumble
at
a
touch
and
indeed
for
bankruptcy
was
now
his
game
this
was
a
miserable
man
far
more
miserable
than
his
son
whose
happiness
he
had
thwarted
his
face
was
furrowed
and
his
hair
thinned
by
a
secret
struggle
and
of
all
the
things
that
gnawed
him
like
the
fox
beneath
his
spartan
robe
none
was
more
bitter
than
to
have
borrowed
five
thousand
pounds
of
his
children
and
sunk
it
his
wife
father
a
keen
man
of
business
who
saw
there
was
little
affection
on
his
side
had
settled
his
daughter
money
on
her
for
life
and
in
case
of
her
death
on
the
children
upon
coming
of
age
the
marriage
of
alfred
or
jane
would
be
sure
to
expose
him
settlements
would
be
proposed
lawyers
engaged
to
peer
into
the
trust
no
they
remain
single
for
the
present
or
else
marry
wealth
so
when
his
son
announced
an
attachment
to
a
young
lady
living
in
a
suburban
villa
it
was
a
terrible
blow
though
he
took
it
with
outward
calm
as
usual
but
if
instead
of
prating
about
beauty
virtue
and
breeding
alfred
had
told
him
hard
cash
in
five
figures
could
be
settled
by
the
bride
family
on
the
young
couple
he
would
have
welcomed
the
wedding
with
great
external
indifference
but
a
secret
gush
of
joy
for
then
he
could
throw
himself
on
alfred
generosity
and
be
released
from
that
one
corroding
debt
perhaps
allowed
to
go
on
drawing
the
interest
of
the
remainder
thus
in
reality
all
the
interests
with
which
this
story
deals
converged
towards
one
point
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
richard
hardie
opposition
was
a
mere
misunderstanding
and
if
he
had
been
told
of
the
cash
and
to
what
purpose
dodd
destined
it
and
then
put
on
board
the
in
the
straits
of
gaspar
he
would
have
calmly
taken
off
his
coat
and
help
to
defend
the
bearer
of
it
against
all
assailants
as
stoutly
and
to
all
appearance
imperturbably
as
he
had
fought
that
other
bitter
battle
at
home
for
there
was
something
heroic
in
this
erring
man
though
his
rectitude
depended
on
circumstances
chapter
ix
the
way
the
pirate
dropped
the
mask
showed
his
black
teeth
and
bore
up
in
chase
was
terrible
so
dilates
and
bounds
the
sudden
tiger
on
his
unwary
prey
there
were
stout
hearts
among
the
officers
of
the
peaceable
but
danger
in
a
new
form
shakes
the
brave
and
this
was
their
first
pirate
their
dismay
broke
out
in
ejaculations
not
loud
but
deep
hush
said
dodd
doggedly
the
lady
beresford
had
just
come
on
deck
to
enjoy
the
balmy
morning
sharpe
said
dodd
in
a
tone
that
conveyed
no
suspicion
to
the
set
the
royals
and
flying
port
port
it
is
cried
the
man
at
the
helm
steer
due
south
and
with
these
words
in
his
mouth
dodd
dived
to
the
by
this
time
elastic
sharpe
had
recovered
the
first
shock
and
the
order
to
crowd
sail
on
the
ship
galled
his
pride
and
his
manhood
he
muttered
indignantly
the
white
feather
this
eased
his
mind
and
he
obeyed
orders
briskly
as
ever
while
he
and
his
hands
were
setting
every
rag
the
ship
could
carry
on
that
tack
the
other
officers
having
unluckily
no
orders
to
execute
stood
gloomy
and
helpless
with
their
eyes
glued
by
a
sort
of
sombre
fascination
on
that
coming
fate
and
they
literally
jumped
and
jarred
when
beresford
her
heart
opened
by
the
lovely
day
broke
in
on
their
nerves
with
her
light
treble
what
a
sweet
morning
gentlemen
after
all
a
voyage
is
a
delightful
thing
oh
what
a
splendid
sea
and
the
very
breeze
is
warm
ah
and
there
a
little
ship
sailing
along
here
freddy
freddy
darling
leave
off
beating
the
sailor
legs
and
come
here
and
see
this
pretty
ship
what
a
pity
it
is
so
far
off
ah
ah
what
is
that
dreadful
noise
for
her
horrible
small
talk
that
grated
on
those
anxious
souls
like
the
mockery
of
some
infantine
fiend
was
cut
short
by
ponderous
blows
and
tremendous
smashing
below
it
was
the
captain
staving
in
the
water
poured
out
at
the
scuppers
clearing
the
lee
guns
said
a
middy
off
his
guard
colonel
kenealy
pricked
up
his
ears
drew
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
smelt
powder
what
for
action
said
he
briskly
where
the
enemy
fullalove
made
him
a
signal
and
they
went
below
beresford
had
not
heard
or
not
appreciated
the
remark
she
prattled
on
till
she
made
the
mates
and
midshipmen
shudder
realise
the
situation
and
the
strange
incongruity
between
the
senses
and
the
mind
in
these
poor
fellows
the
day
had
ripened
its
beauty
beneath
a
purple
heaven
shone
sparkled
and
laughed
a
blue
sea
in
whose
waves
the
tropical
sun
seemed
to
have
fused
his
beams
and
beneath
that
fair
sinless
peaceful
sky
wafted
by
a
balmy
breeze
over
those
smiling
transparent
golden
waves
a
bloodthirsty
pirate
bore
down
on
them
with
a
crew
of
human
tigers
and
a
lady
babble
babble
babble
babble
babble
babble
babbled
in
their
quivering
ears
but
now
the
captain
came
bustling
on
deck
eyed
the
loftier
sails
saw
they
were
drawing
well
appointed
four
midshipmen
a
staff
to
convey
his
orders
gave
bayliss
charge
of
the
carronades
grey
of
the
cutlasses
and
directed
tickell
to
break
the
bad
news
gently
to
beresford
and
to
take
her
below
to
the
orlop
deck
ordered
the
purser
to
serve
out
beet
biscuit
and
grog
to
all
hands
saying
men
ca
work
on
an
empty
stomach
and
fighting
is
hard
work
then
beckoned
the
officers
to
come
round
him
gentlemen
said
he
confidentially
in
crowding
sail
on
this
ship
i
had
no
hope
of
escaping
that
fellow
on
this
tack
but
i
was
and
am
most
anxious
to
gain
the
open
sea
where
i
can
square
my
yards
and
run
for
it
if
i
see
a
chance
at
present
i
shall
carry
on
till
he
comes
within
range
and
then
to
keep
the
company
canvas
from
being
shot
to
rags
i
shall
shorten
sail
and
to
save
ship
and
cargo
and
all
our
lives
i
shall
fight
while
a
plank
of
her
swims
better
be
killed
in
hot
blood
than
walk
the
plank
in
the
officers
cheered
faintly
the
captain
dogged
resolution
stirred
up
theirs
the
pirate
had
gained
another
quarter
of
a
mile
and
more
the
crew
were
hard
at
their
beef
and
grog
and
agreed
among
themselves
it
was
a
comfortable
ship
they
guessed
what
was
coming
and
woe
to
the
ship
in
that
hour
if
the
captain
had
not
won
their
respect
strange
to
say
there
were
two
gentlemen
in
the
to
whom
the
approach
was
not
altogether
unwelcome
colonel
kenealy
and
fullalove
were
rival
sportsmen
and
rival
theorists
kenealy
stood
out
for
a
smooth
bore
and
a
ball
fullalove
for
a
rifle
of
his
own
construction
many
a
doughty
argument
they
had
and
many
a
bragging
match
neither
could
convert
the
other
at
last
fullalove
hinted
that
by
going
ashore
at
the
cape
and
getting
each
behind
a
tree
at
one
hundred
yards
and
popping
at
one
another
one
or
other
would
be
convinced
well
but
said
kenealy
if
he
is
dead
he
will
be
no
wiser
besides
to
a
fellow
like
me
who
has
had
the
luxury
of
popping
at
his
enemies
popping
at
a
friend
is
poor
insipid
that
is
true
said
the
other
regretfully
but
i
reckon
we
shall
never
settle
it
by
theorists
are
amazing
and
it
was
plain
by
the
alacrity
with
which
these
good
creatures
loaded
the
rival
instruments
that
to
them
the
pirate
came
not
so
much
as
a
pirate
as
a
solution
indeed
kenealy
in
the
act
of
charging
his
piece
was
heard
to
mutter
now
this
is
however
these
theorists
were
no
sooner
loaded
than
something
occurred
to
make
them
more
serious
they
were
sent
for
in
haste
to
dodd
cabin
they
found
him
giving
sharpe
a
new
order
shorten
sail
to
the
taupsles
and
jib
get
the
colours
ready
on
the
halyards
and
then
send
the
men
sharpe
ran
out
full
of
zeal
and
tumbled
over
ramgolam
who
was
stooping
remarkably
near
the
keyhole
dodd
hastily
bolted
the
and
looked
with
trembling
lip
and
piteous
earnestness
in
kenealy
face
and
fullalove
they
were
mute
with
surprise
at
a
gaze
so
eloquent
and
yet
mysterious
he
manned
himself
and
opened
his
mind
to
them
with
deep
emotion
yet
not
without
a
certain
simple
dignity
colonel
said
he
you
are
an
old
friend
sir
are
a
new
one
but
i
esteem
you
highly
and
what
my
young
gentlemen
chaff
you
about
you
calling
all
men
brothers
and
making
that
poor
negro
love
you
instead
of
fear
you
that
shows
me
you
have
a
great
heart
my
dear
friends
i
have
been
unlucky
enough
to
bring
my
children
fortune
on
board
this
ship
here
it
is
under
my
shirt
fourteen
thousand
pounds
this
weighs
me
down
oh
if
they
should
lose
it
after
all
do
pray
give
me
a
hand
apiece
and
pledge
your
sacred
words
to
take
it
home
safe
to
my
wife
at
barkington
if
you
or
either
of
you
should
see
this
bright
sun
set
and
i
should
why
dodd
old
fellow
said
kenealy
cheerfully
this
is
not
the
way
to
go
into
colonel
replied
dodd
to
save
this
ship
and
cargo
i
must
be
wherever
the
bullets
are
and
i
will
fullalove
more
sagacious
than
the
worthy
colonel
said
earnestly
captain

the
end
of
my
time
if
i
fail
you
there
my
and
mine
said
kenealy
warmly
they
all
three
joined
hands
and
dodd
seemed
to
cling
to
them
god
bless
you
both
god
bless
you
oh
what
a
weight
your
true
hands
have
pulled
off
my
heart
for
a
few
minutes
the
time
is
short
i
just
offer
a
prayer
to
the
almighty
for
wisdom
and
then
come
up
and
say
a
word
to
the
men
and
fight
the
ship
according
to
my
sail
was
no
sooner
shortened
and
the
crew
ranged
than
the
captain
came
briskly
on
deck
saluted
jumped
on
a
carronade
and
stood
erect
he
was
not
the
man
to
show
the
crew
his
forebodings
pipe
silence
fore
and
my
men
the
schooner
coming
up
on
our
weather
quarter
is
a
portuguese
pirate
his
character
is
known
he
scuttles
all
the
ships
he
boards
dishonours
the
women
and
murders
the
crew
we
cracked
on
to
get
out
of
the
narrows
and
now
we
have
shortened
sail
to
fight
this
blackguard
and
teach
him
to
molest
a
british
ship
i
promise
in
the
name
twenty
pounds
to
every
man
before
the
mast
if
we
beat
him
off
or
him
thirty
if
we
sink
him
and
forty
if
we
tow
him
astern
into
a
friendly
port
eight
guns
are
clear
below
three
on
the
weather
side
five
on
the
lee
for
if
he
knows
his
business
he
will
come
up
on
the
lee
quarter
if
he
does
that
is
no
fault
of
yours
nor
mine
the
muskets
are
all
loaded
the
cutlasses
ground
like
razors
hurrah
we
have
got
women
to
defend
hurrah
a
good
ship
under
our
feet
the
god
of
justice
overhead
british
hearts
in
our
bosoms
and
british
colours
flying
run
up
over
our
the
ship
colours
flew
up
to
the
fore
and
the
union
jack
to
the
mizen
peak
now
lads
i
mean
to
fight
this
ship
while
a
plank
of
her
stamping
on
the
deck
swims
beneath
my
foot
and
what
do
you
say
the
reply
was
a
fierce
hurrah
from
a
hundred
throats
so
loud
so
deep
so
full
of
volume
it
made
the
ship
vibrate
and
rang
in
the
pirate
ears
fierce
but
cunning
he
saw
mischief
in
those
shortened
sails
and
that
union
jack
the
terror
of
his
tribe
rising
to
a
british
cheer
he
lowered
his
mainsail
and
crawled
up
on
the
weather
quarter
arrived
within
a
cable
length
he
his
foresail
to
reduce
his
rate
of
sailing
nearly
to
that
of
the
ship
and
the
next
moment
a
tongue
of
flame
and
then
a
gush
of
smoke
issued
from
his
lee
bow
and
the
ball
flew
screaming
like
a
seagull
over
the
mizen
top
he
then
put
his
helm
up
and
fired
his
other
and
sent
the
shot
hissing
and
skipping
on
the
water
past
the
ship
this
prologue
made
the
novices
wince
bayliss
wanted
to
reply
with
a
carronade
but
dodd
forbade
him
sternly
saying
if
we
keep
him
aloof
we
are
done
the
pirate
drew
nearer
and
fired
both
guns
in
succession
hulled
the
amidships
and
sent
an
ball
through
her
foresail
most
of
the
faces
were
pale
on
the
it
was
very
trying
to
be
shot
at
and
hit
and
make
no
return
the
next
double
discharge
sent
one
shot
smash
through
the
stern
cabin
window
and
splintered
the
bulwark
with
another
wounding
a
seaman
slightly
lie
down
forward
shouted
dodd
bayliss
give
him
a
the
carronade
was
fired
with
a
tremendous
report
but
no
visible
effect
the
pirate
crept
nearer
steering
in
and
out
like
a
snake
to
avoid
the
carronades
and
firing
those
two
heavy
guns
alternately
into
the
devoted
ship
he
hulled
the
now
nearly
every
shot
the
two
available
carronades
replied
noisily
and
jumped
as
usual
they
sent
one
pound
shot
clean
through
the
schooner
deck
and
side
but
that
was
literally
all
they
did
worth
speaking
of
curse
them
cried
dodd
load
them
with
grape
they
are
not
to
be
trusted
with
ball
and
all
my
dumb
the
coward
come
alongside
and
give
them
a
at
the
next
discharge
the
pirate
chipped
the
mizen
mast
and
knocked
a
sailor
into
dead
pieces
on
the
forecastle
dodd
put
his
helm
down
ere
the
smoke
cleared
and
got
three
carronades
to
bear
heavily
laden
with
grape
several
pirates
fell
dead
or
wounded
on
the
crowded
deck
and
some
holes
appeared
in
the
foresail
this
one
interchange
was
quite
in
favour
of
the
ship
but
the
lesson
made
the
enemy
more
cautious
he
crept
nearer
but
steered
so
adroitly
now
right
astern
now
on
the
quarter
that
the
ship
could
seldom
bring
more
than
one
carronade
to
bear
while
he
raked
her
fore
and
aft
with
grape
and
ball
in
this
alarming
situation
dodd
kept
as
many
of
the
men
below
as
possible
but
for
all
he
could
do
four
were
killed
and
seven
wounded
fullalove
worth
came
too
true
it
was
the
swordfish
and
the
whale
it
was
a
fight
of
hammer
and
anvil
one
hit
the
other
made
a
noise
cautious
and
cruel
the
pirate
hung
on
the
poor
hulking
quarters
and
raked
her
at
distance
he
made
her
pass
a
bitter
time
and
her
captain
to
see
the
splintering
hull
the
parting
shrouds
the
shivered
gear
and
hear
the
shrieks
and
groans
of
his
wounded
and
he
unable
to
reply
in
kind
the
sweat
of
agony
poured
down
his
face
oh
if
he
could
but
reach
the
open
sea
and
square
his
yards
and
make
a
long
chase
of
it
perhaps
fall
in
with
aid
wincing
under
each
heavy
blow
he
crept
doggedly
patiently
on
towards
that
one
visible
hope
at
last
when
the
ship
was
choved
with
shot
and
peppered
with
grape
the
channel
opened
in
five
minutes
more
he
could
put
her
dead
before
the
wind
no
the
pirate
on
whose
side
luck
had
been
from
the
first
got
half
a
broadside
to
bear
at
long
killed
a
midshipman
by
side
cut
away
two
of
the
mizen
shrouds
wounded
the
gaff
and
cut
the
down
fell
that
powerful
sail
into
the
water
and
dragged
across
the
ship
forefoot
stopping
her
way
to
the
open
sea
she
panted
for
the
mates
groaned
the
crew
cheered
stoutly
as
british
tars
do
in
any
great
disaster
the
pirates
yelled
with
ferocious
triumph
like
the
devils
they
looked
but
most
human
events
even
calamities
have
two
sides
the
being
brought
almost
to
a
standstill
the
pirate
forged
ahead
against
his
will
and
the
combat
took
a
new
and
terrible
form
the
elephant
gun
popped
and
the
rifle
cracked
in
the
mizen
top
and
the
man
at
the
pirate
helm
jumped
into
the
air
and
fell
dead
both
theorists
claimed
him
then
the
three
carronades
peppered
him
hotly
and
he
hurled
an
iron
shower
back
with
fatal
effect
then
at
last
the
long
on
the
got
a
word
in
the
old
niler
was
not
the
man
to
miss
a
vessel
alongside
in
a
quiet
sea
he
sent
two
round
shot
clean
through
him
the
third
splintered
his
bulwark
and
swept
across
his
deck
his
masts
fire
at
his
masts
roared
dodd
to
monk
through
his
trumpet
he
then
got
the
jib
clear
and
made
what
sail
he
could
without
taking
all
the
hands
from
the
guns
this
kept
the
vessels
nearly
alongside
a
few
minutes
and
the
fight
was
hot
as
fire
the
pirate
now
for
the
first
time
hoisted
his
flag
it
was
black
as
ink
his
crew
yelled
as
it
rose
the
britons
instead
of
quailing
cheered
with
fierce
derision
the
pirate
wild
crew
of
yellow
malays
black
chinless
papuans
and
bronzed
portuguese
served
their
side
guns
well
and
with
ferocious
cries
the
white
britons
drunk
with
battle
now
naked
to
the
waist
grimed
with
powder
and
spotted
like
leopards
with
blood
their
and
their
mates
replied
with
loud
undaunted
cheers
and
a
deadly
hail
of
grape
from
the
while
the
and
his
mates
loading
with
a
rapidity
the
mixed
races
opposed
could
not
rival
hulled
the
schooner
well
between
wind
and
water
and
then
fired
at
her
masts
as
ordered
and
began
to
play
the
mischief
with
her
shrouds
and
rigging
meantime
fullalove
and
kenealy
aided
by
vespasian
who
loaded
were
quietly
butchering
the
pirate
crew
two
a
minute
and
hoped
to
settle
the
question
they
were
fighting
for
smooth
bore
rifle
but
unluckily
neither
fired
once
without
killing
so
there
was
nothing
the
pirate
bold
as
he
was
got
sick
of
fair
fighting
first
he
hoisted
his
mainsail
and
threw
rapidly
ahead
with
a
slight
bearing
to
windward
and
dismounted
a
carronade
and
stove
in
the
ship
by
way
of
a
parting
kick
the
men
hurled
a
contemptuous
cheer
after
him
they
thought
they
had
beaten
him
off
but
dodd
knew
better
he
was
but
retiring
a
little
way
to
make
a
more
deadly
attack
than
ever
he
would
soon
wear
and
cross
the
defenceless
bows
to
rake
her
fore
and
aft
at
distance
or
grapple
and
board
the
enfeebled
ship
two
hundred
strong
dodd
flew
to
the
helm
and
with
his
own
hands
put
it
hard
to
give
the
one
more
chance
the
last
of
sinking
or
disabling
the
destroyer
as
the
ship
obeyed
and
a
bellowed
below
him
he
saw
a
vessel
running
out
from
long
island
and
coming
swiftly
up
on
his
lee
quarter
it
was
a
schooner
was
she
coming
to
his
aid
horror
a
black
flag
floated
from
her
foremast
head
while
dodd
eyes
were
staring
almost
out
of
his
head
at
this
deathblow
to
hope
monk
fired
again
and
just
then
a
pale
face
came
close
to
dodd
and
a
solemn
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
our
ammunition
is
nearly
done
dodd
seized
sharpe
hand
convulsively
and
pointed
to
the
consort
coming
up
to
finish
them
and
said
with
the
calm
of
a
brave
man
despair
cutlasses
and
die
hard
at
that
moment
the
fired
his
last
gun
it
sent
a
on
board
the
retiring
pirate
took
off
a
portuguese
head
and
spun
it
clean
into
the
sea
ever
so
far
to
windward
and
cut
the
schooner
foremast
so
nearly
through
that
it
trembled
and
nodded
and
presently
snapped
with
a
loud
crack
and
came
down
like
a
broken
tree
with
the
yard
and
sail
the
latter
overlapping
the
deck
and
burying
itself
black
flag
and
all
in
the
sea
and
there
in
one
moment
lay
the
destroyer
buffeting
and
wriggling
like
a
heron
on
the
water
with
his
long
wings
broken
an
utter
cripple
the
victorious
crew
raised
a
stunning
cheer
silence
roared
dodd
with
his
trumpet
all
hands
make
sail
he
set
his
courses
bent
a
new
jib
and
stood
out
to
windward
close
hauled
in
hopes
to
make
a
good
offing
and
then
put
his
ship
dead
before
the
wind
which
was
now
rising
to
a
stiff
breeze
in
doing
this
he
crossed
the
crippled
pirate
bows
within
eighty
yards
and
sore
was
the
temptation
to
rake
him
but
his
ammunition
being
short
and
his
danger
being
imminent
from
the
other
pirate
he
had
the
to
resist
the
great
temptation
he
hailed
the
mizen
top
can
you
two
hinder
them
from
firing
that
gun
i
rather
think
we
can
said
fullalove
eh
colonel
and
he
tapped
his
long
rifle
the
ship
no
sooner
crossed
the
schooner
than
a
malay
ran
forward
with
a
linstock
pop
went
the
colonel
ready
carbine
and
the
malay
fell
over
dead
and
the
linstock
flew
out
of
his
hand
a
tall
portuguese
with
a
movement
of
rage
snatched
it
up
and
darted
to
the
gun
the
yankee
rifle
cracked
but
a
moment
too
late
bang
went
the
pirate
and
crashed
into
the
side
and
passed
nearly
through
her
disabled
the
schooner
head
had
come
round
to
windward
though
she
was
drifting
to
leeward
ye
missed
him
ye
missed
him
cried
the
rival
theorist
joyfully
he
was
mistaken
the
smoke
cleared
and
there
was
the
pirate
captain
leaning
wounded
against
the
mainmast
with
a
yankee
bullet
in
his
shoulder
and
his
crew
uttering
yells
of
dismay
and
vengeance
they
jumped
and
raged
and
brandished
their
knives
and
made
horrid
gesticulations
of
revenge
and
the
white
eyeballs
of
the
malays
and
papuans
glittered
fiendishly
and
the
wounded
captain
raised
his
sound
arm
and
had
a
signal
hoisted
to
his
consort
and
she
bore
up
in
chase
and
jamming
her
fore
lateen
flat
as
a
board
lay
far
nearer
the
wind
than
the
could
and
sailed
three
feet
to
her
two
besides
on
this
superiority
being
made
clear
the
situation
of
the
merchant
vessel
though
not
so
utterly
desperate
as
before
monk
fired
his
lucky
shot
became
pitiable
enough
if
she
ran
before
the
wind
the
fresh
pirate
would
cut
her
off
if
she
lay
to
windward
she
might
postpone
the
inevitable
and
fatal
collision
with
a
foe
as
strong
as
that
she
had
only
escaped
by
a
rare
piece
of
luck
but
this
would
give
the
crippled
pirate
time
to
refit
and
unite
to
destroy
her
add
to
this
the
failing
ammunition
and
the
thinned
crew
dodd
cast
his
eyes
all
round
the
horizon
for
help
the
sea
was
blank
the
bright
sun
was
hidden
now
drops
of
rain
fell
and
the
wind
was
beginning
to
sing
and
the
sea
to
rise
a
little
gentlemen
said
he
let
us
kneel
down
and
pray
for
wisdom
in
this
sore
he
and
his
officers
kneeled
on
the
when
they
rose
dodd
stood
rapt
about
a
minute
his
great
thoughtful
eye
saw
no
more
the
enemy
the
sea
nor
anything
external
it
was
turned
inward
his
officers
looked
at
him
in
silence
sharpe
said
he
at
last
there
be
a
way
out
of
them
both
with
such
a
breeze
as
this
is
now
if
we
could
but
see
ay
groaned
sharpe
dodd
mused
again
about
ship
said
he
softly
like
an
absent
man
ay
ay
sir
steer
due
north
said
he
still
like
one
whose
mind
was
elsewhere
while
the
ship
was
coming
about
he
gave
minute
orders
to
the
mates
and
the
gunner
to
ensure
in
the
delicate
and
dangerous
manoeuvres
that
were
sure
to
be
at
hand
the
wind
was
lie
was
standing
north
one
pirate
lay
on
his
lee
beam
stopping
a
leak
between
wind
and
water
and
hacking
the
deck
clear
of
his
broken
mast
and
yards
the
other
fresh
and
thirsting
for
the
easy
prey
came
up
to
weather
on
him
and
hang
on
his
quarter
pirate
fashion
when
they
were
distant
about
a
cable
length
the
fresh
pirate
to
meet
the
ship
change
of
tactics
changed
his
own
luffed
up
and
gave
the
ship
a
broadside
well
aimed
but
not
destructive
the
guns
being
loaded
with
ball
dodd
instead
of
replying
immediately
put
his
helm
hard
up
and
ran
under
the
pirate
stern
while
he
was
jammed
up
in
the
wind
and
with
his
five
eighteen
pounders
raked
him
fore
and
aft
then
paying
off
gave
him
three
carronades
crammed
with
grape
and
canister
the
rapid
discharge
of
eight
guns
made
the
ship
tremble
and
enveloped
her
in
thick
smoke
loud
shrieks
and
groans
were
heard
from
the
schooner
the
smoke
cleared
the
pirate
mainsail
hung
on
deck
his
was
cut
off
like
a
carrot
and
the
sail
struggling
his
foresail
looked
lace
lanes
of
dead
and
wounded
lay
still
or
writhing
on
his
deck
and
his
lee
scuppers
ran
blood
into
the
sea
dodd
squared
his
yards
and
bore
away
the
ship
rushed
down
the
wind
leaving
the
schooner
staggered
and
all
abroad
but
for
long
the
pirate
wore
and
fired
his
bow
chasers
at
the
now
flying
split
one
of
the
carronades
in
two
and
killed
a
lascar
and
made
a
hole
in
the
foresail
this
done
he
hoisted
his
mainsail
again
in
a
trice
sent
his
wounded
below
flung
his
dead
overboard
to
the
horror
of
their
foes
and
came
after
the
flying
ship
yawing
and
firing
his
bow
chasers
the
ship
was
silent
she
had
no
shot
to
throw
away
not
only
did
she
take
these
blows
like
a
coward
but
all
signs
of
life
disappeared
on
her
except
two
men
at
the
wheel
and
the
captain
on
the
main
gangway
dodd
had
ordered
the
crew
out
of
the
rigging
armed
them
with
cutlasses
and
laid
them
flat
on
the
forecastle
he
also
compelled
kenealy
and
fullalove
to
come
down
out
of
harm
way
no
wiser
on
the
smooth
bore
question
than
they
went
up
the
great
patient
ship
ran
environed
by
her
foes
one
destroyer
right
in
her
course
another
in
her
wake
following
her
with
yells
of
vengeance
and
pounding
away
at
her
but
no
reply
suddenly
the
yells
of
the
pirates
on
both
sides
ceased
and
there
was
a
moment
of
dead
silence
on
the
sea
yet
nothing
fresh
had
happened
yes
this
had
happened
the
pirates
to
windward
and
the
pirates
to
leeward
of
the
had
found
out
at
one
and
the
same
moment
that
the
merchant
captain
they
had
lashed
and
bullied
and
tortured
was
a
patient
but
tremendous
man
it
was
not
only
to
rake
the
fresh
schooner
he
had
put
his
ship
before
the
wind
but
also
by
a
double
daring
masterstroke
to
hurl
his
monster
ship
bodily
on
the
other
without
a
foresail
she
could
never
get
out
of
her
way
the
pirate
crew
had
stopped
the
leak
and
cut
away
and
unshipped
the
broken
foremast
and
were
stepping
a
new
one
when
they
saw
the
huge
ship
bearing
down
in
full
sail
nothing
easier
than
to
slip
out
of
her
way
could
they
get
the
foresail
to
draw
but
the
time
was
short
the
deadly
intention
manifest
the
coming
destruction
swift
after
that
solemn
silence
came
a
storm
of
cries
and
curses
as
their
seamen
went
to
work
to
fit
the
yard
and
raise
the
sail
while
their
fighting
men
seized
their
matchlocks
and
trained
the
guns
they
were
well
commanded
by
an
heroic
able
villain
astern
the
consort
thundered
but
the
response
was
a
dead
silence
more
awful
than
broadsides
for
then
was
seen
with
what
majesty
the
enduring
fights
one
of
that
indomitable
race
on
the
gangway
one
at
the
foremast
two
at
the
wheel
conned
and
steered
the
great
ship
down
on
a
hundred
matchlocks
and
a
grinning
broadside
just
as
they
would
have
conned
and
steered
her
into
a
british
harbour
starboard
said
dodd
in
a
deep
calm
voice
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
starboard
it
the
pirate
wriggled
ahead
a
little
the
man
forward
made
a
silent
signal
to
dodd
port
said
dodd
quietly
port
it
but
at
this
critical
moment
the
pirate
astern
sent
a
mischievous
shot
and
knocked
one
of
the
men
to
atoms
at
the
helm
dodd
waved
his
hand
without
a
word
and
another
man
rose
from
the
deck
and
took
his
place
in
silence
and
laid
his
unshaking
hand
on
the
wheel
stained
with
that
man
warm
blood
whose
place
he
took
the
high
ship
was
now
scarce
sixty
yards
distant
seemed
to
know
she
reared
her
lofty
with
great
awful
shoots
into
the
air
but
now
the
panting
pirates
got
their
new
foresail
hoisted
with
a
joyful
shout
it
drew
the
schooner
gathered
way
and
their
furious
consort
close
on
the
heels
just
then
scourged
her
deck
with
grape
port
said
dodd
calmly
port
it
the
giant
prow
darted
at
the
escaping
pirate
that
acre
of
coming
canvas
took
the
wind
out
of
the
swift
schooner
foresail
it
flapped
oh
then
she
was
doomed
that
awful
moment
parted
the
races
on
board
her
the
papuans
and
sooloos
their
black
faces
livid
and
blue
with
horror
leaped
yelling
into
the
sea
or
crouched
and
whimpered
the
yellow
malays
and
brown
portuguese
though
blanched
to
one
colour
now
turned
on
death
like
dying
panthers
fired
two
cannon
slap
into
the
bows
and
snapped
their
muskets
and
matchlocks
at
their
solitary
executioner
on
the
ship
gangway
and
out
flew
their
knives
like
crushed
wasp
stings

the
indiaman
cutwater
in
thick
smoke
beat
in
the
schooner
broadside
down
went
her
masts
to
leeward
like
whipping
the
water
there
was
a
horrible
shrieking
yell
wild
forms
heaped
off
on
the
and
were
hacked
to
pieces
almost
ere
they
reached
the
deck
a
surge
a
chasm
in
the
sea
filled
with
an
instant
rush
of
engulphing
waves
a
long
awful
grating
grinding
noise
never
to
be
forgotten
in
this
world
all
along
under
the
keel
and
the
fearful
majestic
monster
passed
on
over
the
blank
she
had
made
with
a
pale
crew
standing
silent
and
awestruck
on
her
deck
a
cluster
of
wild
heads
and
staring
eyeballs
bobbing
like
corks
in
her
foaming
wake
sole
relic
of
the
destroyer
and
a
wounded
man
staggering
on
the
gangway
with
hands
uplifted
and
staring
eyes
shot
in
two
places
the
head
and
the
breast
with
a
loud
cry
of
pity
and
dismay
sharpe
fullalove
kenealy
and
others
rushed
to
catch
him
but
ere
they
got
near
the
captain
of
the
triumphant
ship
fell
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
his
head
sunk
over
the
gangway
and
his
blood
ran
fast
and
pattered
in
the
midst
of
them
on
the
deck
he
had
defended
so
bravely
chapter
x
they
got
to
the
wounded
captain
and
raised
him
he
revived
a
little
and
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
sharpe
he
clutched
him
and
cried
stunsels
oh
captain
said
sharpe
let
the
ship
go
it
is
you
we
are
anxious
for
at
this
dodd
lifted
up
his
hands
and
beat
the
air
impatiently
and
cried
again
in
the
thin
querulous
voice
of
a
wounded
man
but
eagerly
stunsels
stunsels
on
this
sharpe
gave
the
command
make
sail
all
hands
set
stunsels
and
aloft
while
the
unwounded
hands
swarmed
into
the
rigging
the
surgeon
came
aft
in
all
haste
but
dodd
declined
him
till
all
his
men
should
have
been
looked
to
meantime
he
had
himself
carried
to
the
poop
and
laid
on
a
mattress
his
bleeding
head
bound
tight
with
a
wet
cambric
handkerchief
and
his
pale
face
turned
towards
the
hostile
schooner
astern
she
had
to
hove
to
and
was
picking
up
the
survivors
of
her
consort
the
group
on
the
watched
her
to
see
what
she
would
do
next
flushed
with
immediate
success
the
younger
officers
crowed
their
fears
she
would
not
be
game
to
attack
them
again
dodd
fears
ran
the
other
way
he
said
in
the
weak
voice
to
which
he
was
now
reduced
they
are
taking
a
wet
blanket
aboard
that
crew
of
blackguards
we
swamped
wo
want
any
more
of
us
it
all
depends
on
the
pirate
captain
if
he
is
not
drowned
then
blow
wind
rise
sea
or
there
trouble
ahead
for
as
soon
as
the
schooner
had
picked
up
the
last
swimmer
she
hoisted
foresail
mainsail
and
jib
with
admirable
rapidity
and
bore
down
in
chase
the
had
meantime
got
a
start
of
more
than
a
mile
and
was
now
running
before
a
stiff
breeze
with
studding
sails
alow
and
aloft
in
an
hour
the
vessels
ran
nearly
twelve
miles
and
the
pirate
had
gained
half
a
mile
at
the
end
of
the
next
hour
they
were
out
of
sight
of
land
wind
and
sea
rising
and
the
pirate
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
astern
the
schooner
was
now
rising
and
falling
on
the
waves
the
ship
only
nodding
and
firm
as
a
rock
blow
wind
rise
sea
faltered
dodd
another
passed
without
perceptibly
altering
the
position
of
the
vessels
then
suddenly
the
wounded
captain
laid
aside
his
glass
after
a
long
examination
and
rose
unaided
to
his
feet
in
great
excitement
and
found
his
manly
voice
for
a
moment
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
now
pitching
schooner
and
roared
ye
portuguese
lubber
outfought
outmanoeuvred
and
outsailed
it
was
a
burst
of
exultation
rare
for
him
he
paid
for
it
by
sinking
faint
and
helpless
into
his
friend
arms
and
the
surgeon
returning
soon
after
insisted
on
his
being
taken
to
his
cabin
and
kept
quite
quiet
as
they
were
carrying
him
below
the
pirate
captain
made
the
same
discovery
that
the
ship
was
gaining
on
him
he
hauled
to
the
wind
directly
and
abandoned
the
chase
when
the
now
receding
pirate
was
nearly
hull
down
the
sun
began
to
set
tickell
looked
at
him
and
said
hallo
old
fellow
what
are
about
why
it
is
two
the
remark
was
quite
honest
he
really
feared
for
a
moment
that
orb
was
mistaken
and
would
get
himself
and
others
into
trouble
however
the
middy
proved
to
be
wrong
and
the
sun
right
to
a
minute
time
flies
fast
fighting
beresford
came
on
deck
with
brat
and
poodle
fred
a
destructive
child
clapped
his
hands
with
glee
at
the
holes
in
the
canvas
snap
toddled
about
smelling
the
blood
of
the
slain
and
wagging
his
tail
by
halves
perplexed
well
gentlemen
said
beresford
i
hope
you
have
made
noise
enough
over
one
head
and
what
a
time
you
did
take
to
beat
that
little
bit
of
a
thing
freddy
be
quiet
you
worry
me
where
is
your
bearer
will
anybody
oblige
me
by
finding
ramgolam
i
will
said
tickell
hastily
and
ran
off
for
the
purpose
but
he
returned
after
some
time
with
a
long
face
no
ramgolam
to
be
found
fullalove
referred
her
with
eye
to
vespasian
i
have
a
friend
here
who
says
he
can
tell
you
something
about
can
you
my
good
man
inquired
the
lady
turning
haughtily
towards
the
negro
iss
missy
said
vespasian
showing
his
white
teeth
in
a
broad
grin
dis
child

where
to
find
dat
ar
niggar
widout
him
been
and
absquatulated
then
go
and
fetch
him
vespasian
went
off
with
an
obedient
start
this
annoyed
fullalove
interfered
with
his
system
madam
said
he
gravely
would
you
oblige
me
by
bestowing
on
my
friend
a
portion
of
that
courtesy
with
which
you
favour
me
and
which
becomes
you
so
gracefully
certainly
not
replied
beresford
mr
fullalove
i
am
out
of
patience
with
you
the
idea
of
a
sensible
intelligent
gentleman
like
you
calling
that
creature
your
friend
and
you
an
american
where
they
do
nothing
but
whip
them
from
morning
till
night
who
ever
heard
of
making
friends
with
a
black
now
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
i
detest
practical
for
the
stalwart
negro
had
returned
bringing
a
tall
in
his
arms
he
now
set
it
up
before
her
remarking
dis
yar
bag
white
outside
but
him
black
to
confirm
his
words
he
drew
off
the
bag
and
revealed
ramgolam
his
black
skin
powdered
with
meal
the
negro
then
blew
the
flour
off
his
face
and
dusted
him
a
bit
the
spectators
laughed
heartily
but
ramgolam
never
moved
a
muscle
not
a
morsel
discomposed
at
what
would
have
made
an
european
miserably
ashamed
even
in
a
pantomime
the
caucasian
darkie
retained
all
his
dignity
while
the
african
one
dusted
him
but
being
dusted
he
put
on
his
obsequiousness
stepped
forward
joined
his
palms
together
to
beresford
like
medieval
knights
and
modern
children
at
their
devotions
and
addressed
her
thus
daughter
of
light
he
who
basks
in
your
beams
said
to
himself
pirates
are
upon
us
those
children
of
blood
whom
sheitan
their
master
blast
for
ever
they
will
ravish
the
queen
of
sunshine
and
the
ayahs
and
throw
the
sahibs
and
sailors
into
the
sea
but
bread
being
the
staff
of
existence
these
foxes
of
the
water
will
not
harm
it
but
keep
it
for
their
lawless
appetites
therefore
ramgolam
son
of
chittroo
son
of
soonarayan
will
put
the
finger
of
silence
on
the
lip
of
discretion
and
be
bread
in
the
day
of
adversity
the
sons
of
sheitan
will
peradventure
return
to
dry
land
and
close
the
eye
of
watchfulness
then
will
i
emerge
like
the
sun
from
a
cloud
and
depart
in
oh
very
well
said
beresford
then
you
are
an
abominable
egotist
that
is
all
and
a
coward
and
thank
heaven
freddy
and
i
were
defended
by
english
and
americans
and
hem
their
friends
and
not
by
she
added
charmingly
this
shows
me
my
first
words
on
coming
here
ought
to
have
been
to
offer
my
warmest
thanks
to
the
brave
men
who
have
defended
me
and
my
child
and
swept
them
so
queenly
a
curtesy
that
the
men
hats
and
caps
flew
off
in
an
instant
mr
black
said
she
turning
with
a
voice
of
honey
to
vespasian
but
aiming
obliquely
at
fullalove
heart
you
oblige
me
by
kicking
that
dog
a
he
is
always
smelling
what
does
not
belong
to
him
why
it
is
blood
oh
and
she
turned
pale
in
a
moment
sharpe
thought
some
excuse
necessary
you
see
we
have
had
time
to
clean
the
decks
it
is
the
blood
of
men
of
the
poor
fellows
who
have
defended
us
so
nobly
faltered
the
lady
trembling
visibly
well
said
sharpe
still
half
apologetically
you
know
a
ship
ca
fight
all
day
long
without
an
accident
or
he
added
with
nautical
simplicity
and
love
of
cleanliness
however
the
deck
will
be
cleaned
and
long
before
you
turn
beresford
was
too
much
overcome
to
explain
how
much
deeper
her
emotion
was
than
a
dislike
to
stained
floors
she
turned
faint
and
on
getting
the
better
of
that
went
down
to
her
cabin
crying
thence
issued
a
royal
order
that
the
wounded
were
to
have
wine
and
every
luxury
they
could
fancy
without
limit
or
stint
at
her
expense
the
next
day
a
deep
gloom
reigned
in
the
ship
the
crew
were
ranged
in
their
sunday
clothes
and
a
grating
was
rigged
sharpe
read
the
burial
service
and
the
dead
each
man
sewed
up
in
his
hammock
with
a
shot
glided
off
the
grating
into
the
sea
with
a
sullen
plunge
while
their
shipmates
cried
so
that
the
tears
dripped
on
the
deck
with
these
regrets
for
the
slain
too
violent
to
last
was
mingled
a
gloomy
fear
that
death
had
a
heavier
blow
in
store
the
report
of
captain
dodd
was
most
alarming
he
had
become
delirious
about
midnight
and
so
continued
sharpe
commanded
the
ship
and
the
rough
sailors
stepped
like
cats
over
that
part
of
the
deck
beneath
which
their
unconscious
captain
lay
if
two
men
met
on
the
a
look
of
anxious
but
not
hopeful
inquiry
was
sure
to
pass
between
them
among
the
constant
inquirers
was
ramgolam
the
grave
hindoo
often
waylaid
the
surgeon
at
the
captain
door
to
get
the
first
intelligence
this
marked
sympathy
with
a
hero
in
extremity
was
hardly
expected
from
a
sage
who
at
the
first
note
of
war
trumpet
had
vanished
in
a
however
it
went
down
to
his
credit
one
person
however
took
a
dark
view
of
this
innocent
circumstance
but
then
that
hostile
critic
was
vespasian
a
rival
in
matters
of
tint
he
exploded
in
one
of
those
droll
rages
darkies
seem
liable
to

cunnel
said
he
what
for

stupid
questions

suggested
slily
that
a

the
colonel

dealt
little
in
innuendo
said
come
do
you
be
so
hard
on
jet
you
ebony
bery

replied
vespasian
ceremoniously
and
with
seeming
acquiescence

with
sudden
ire

miscall
him
an
abominable
egotisk
yes
said
fullalove
winking
to
kenealy
but
we
do
know
what
it
means
do
you
sir
iss
sar
dat
ar
expression
he
signify
a
darned
old
cuss
dat
says
to
dis
child
lord
vespasium
take
benevolence
on
your
insidious
slave
and
invest
me
in
a
instead
of
fighting
for
de
ladies
like
a
freenindependum
citizen
now
you
two
go
fast
asleep
dis
child
lie
shut
one
eye
and
open
de
oder
bery
wide
open
on
dat
ar
and
with
this
mysterious
threat
he
stalked
away
his
contempt
for
a
black
skin
his
ebullitions
of
unexpected
ire
his
turgid
pomposity
and
love
of
long
terms
may
make
the
reader
smile
but
they
could
hardly
amuse
his
friends
just
then
everything
that
touched
upon
dodd
was
too
serious
now
the
surgeon
sat
up
with
him
nearly
all
night
in
the
daytime
those
two
friends
sat
for
hours
in
his
cabin
watching
sadly
and
silently
moistening
his
burning
brow
and
his
parched
lips
at
length
one
afternoon
there
came
a
crisis
which
took
an
unfavourable
turn
then
the
surgeon
speaking
confidentially
to
these
two
staunch
friends
inquired
if
they
had
asked
themselves
what
should
be
done
with
the
body
why
i
ask
said
he
is
because
we
are
in
a
very
hot
latitude
and
if
you
wish
to
convey
it
to
barkington
the
measures
ought
to
be
taken
in
time
in
fact
within
an
hour
or
two
after
the
poor
friends
were
shocked
and
sickened
by
this
horrible
piece
of
foresight
but
colonel
kenealy
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
his
old
friend
should
never
be
buried
like
a
kitten
then
you
had
better
ask
sharpe
to
give
me
an
order
for
a
barrel
of
spirits
said
the
surgeon
yes
yes
for
two
if
you
like
oh
do
die
dodd
my
poor
old
fellow
how
shall
i
ever
face
his
wife
i
remember
her
the
loveliest
girl
you
ever
saw
with
such
a
tale
as
this
she
will
think
it
a
cruel
thing
i
should
come
out
of
it
without
a
scratch
and
a
ten
times
better
man
to
be
dead
and
so
it
is
it
is
cruel
it
is
unjust
it
is
monstrous
him
to
be
lying
there
and
we
muffs
to
be
sitting
croaking
over
him
and
watching
for
his
last
breath
like
three
cursed
old
and
the
stout
colonel
groaned
aloud
when
the
surgeon
left
them
they
fell
naturally
upon
another
topic
the
pledge
they
had
given
dodd
about
the
they
ascertained
it
was
upon
him
next
his
skin
but
it
seemed
as
unnecessary
as
it
was
repugnant
to
remove
it
from
his
living
person
they
agreed
however
that
instantly
on
his
decease
they
would
take
possession
of
it
note
the
particulars
seal
it
up
and
carry
it
to
dodd
with
such
comfort
as
they
could
hope
to
give
her
by
relating
the
gallant
act
in
which
his
precious
life
was
lost
at
the
surgeon
took
his
place
by
dodd
bedside
and
the
pair
whom
one
thing
after
another
had
drawn
so
close
together
retired
to
kenealy
cabin
many
a
merry
chat
they
had
had
there
and
many
a
gaseonade
being
rival
hunters
but
now
they
were
together
for
physical
companionship
in
sorrow
rather
than
for
conversation
they
smoked
their
cigars
in
moody
silence
and
at
midnight
shook
hands
with
a
sigh
and
parted
that
sigh
meant
to
say
that
in
the
morning
all
would
be
over
they
turned
in
but
ere
either
of
them
was
asleep
suddenly
the
captain
cabin
seemed
to
fill
with
roars
and
shrieks
of
wild
beasts
that
made
the
whole
ship
ring
in
the
silent
night
the
savage
cries
were
answered
on
deck
by
shouts
of
dismay
and
many
pattering
feet
making
for
the
companion
ladder
but
the
nearest
persons
to
the
cabin
and
the
first
to
reach
it
were
kenealy
and
fullalove
who
burst
in
the
former
with
a
drawn
sword
the
latter
with
a
revolver
both
in
their
nightgowns
and
there
saw
a
sight
that
took
their
breath
away
the
surgeon
was
not
there
and
two
black
men
one
with
a
knife
and
one
with
his
bare
claws
were
fighting
and
struggling
and
trampling
all
over
the
cabin
at
once
and
the
dying
man
sitting
up
in
his
cot
pale
and
glaring
at
them
chapter
xi
the
two
supple
dusky
forms
went
whirling
so
fast
there
was
no
grasping
them
to
part
them
but
presently
the
negro
seized
the
hindoo
by
the
throat
the
hindoo
just
pricked
him
in
the
arm
with
his
knife
and
the
next
moment
his
own
head
was
driven
against
the
side
of
the
cabin
with
a
stunning
crack
and
there
he
was
pinned
and
wriggling
and
bluish
with
fright
whereas
the
other
swart
face
close
against
his
was
with
rage
and
its
two
fireballs
of
eyes
rolled
fearfully
as
none
but
african
eyes
can
roll
fullalove
pacified
him
by
voice
and
touch
he
withdrew
his
iron
grasp
with
sullen
and
lingering
reluctance
and
glared
like
a
disappointed
mastiff
the
cabin
was
now
full
and
sharpe
was
for
putting
both
the
blacks
in
irons
no
splitter
of
hairs
was
he
but
fullalove
suggested
there
might
be
a
moral
distinction
between
things
that
looked
equally
dark
to
the
eye
well
then
speak
quick
both
of
you
said
sharpe
or
i
lay
ye
both
by
the
heels
ye
black
scoundrels
what
business
have
you
in
the
captain
cabin
kicking
up
the
devil
delight
thus
threatened
vespasian
panted
out
his
tale
he
had
discovered
this
nigger
as
he
persisted
in
calling
the
hindoo
eternally
prowling
about
the
good
captain
door
and
asking
stupid
questions
he
had
watched
him
and
on
the
surgeon
coming
out
with
the
good
news
that
the
captain
was
better
in
had
crawled
this
yar
abominable
and
he
raised
a
ponderous
fist
to
point
the
polysyllables
with
this
aid
the
sarcasm
would
doubtless
have
been
crushing
but
fullalove
hung
on
the
sable
orator
arm
and
told
him
drily
to
try
and
speak
without
gesticulating
the
darned
old
cuss
said
vespasian
with
a
pathetic
sigh
at
not
being
let
hit
him
he
resumed
and
told
how
he
had
followed
the
hindoo
stealthily
and
found
him
with
a
knife
uplifted
over
the
captain
a
tremor
ran
through
all
present
robbing
him
at
this
a
loud
murmur
filled
the
room
a
very
ugly
one
the
sort
of
snarl
with
which
dogs
fly
at
dogs
throats
with
their
teeth
and
men
fly
at
men
throats
with
a
cord
be
quiet
said
sharpe
imperiously
i
have
no
lynching
in
a
vessel
i
command
now
then
you
sir
how
do
you
know
he
was
robbing
the
captain
how
do
i
know
yah
yah
if
you
please
you
tell
dis
unskeptical
gemman
whether
you
do
miss
a
lilly
book
out
of
your
bosom
during
this
extraordinary
scene
dodd
had
been
looking
from
one
speaker
to
another
in
great
surprise
and
some
confusion
but
at
the
direct
appeal
his
hand
went
to
his
breast
and
clutched
it
with
a
feeble
but
heartrending
cry
oh
him
not
gone
far
yah
yah
and
vespasian
stooped
and
took
up
an
oilskin
packet
off
the
floor
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
dis
child
seen
him
in
dat
ar
niggar
hand
and
heard
him
go
whack
on
de
dodd
hurried
the
packet
into
his
bosom
then
turned
all
gratitude
to
his
sable
friend
now
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
give
me
your
honest
hand
you
do
know
what
you
have
done
for
me
and
and
sick
as
he
was
he
wrung
vespasian
hand
with
convulsive
strength
and
would
not
part
with
it
vespasian
patted
him
soothingly
all
over
and
whimpered
out
nebber
you
mind
you
bery
good
man
this
child
bery
fond
of
you
a
long
time
ago
you
bery
good
man
outrageous
good
man
dam
good
man
i
propose
your
health
invalesee
directly
while
dodd
was
speaking
the
others
were
silent
out
of
respect
but
now
sharpe
broke
in
and
with
the
national
desire
to
hear
both
sides
called
on
ramgolam
for
his
version
the
hindoo
was
now
standing
with
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
looking
all
the
martyr
meek
and
dignified
he
inquired
of
sharpe
in
very
broken
english
whether
he
spoke
hindostanee
not
i
nor
do
act
it
neither
said
sharpe
at
this
confession
ramgolam
looked
down
on
him
with
pity
and
mild
contempt
tickell
was
put
forward
as
interpreter
in
hindostanee
he
whom
destiny
too
strong
for
mortals
now
oppresses
with
iron
hand
and
feeds
with
the
bread
of
affliction
tickell
translating
he
who
by
bad
luck
has
got
into
trouble
has
long
observed
the
virtues
that
embellish
the
commander
of
this
ship
resembling
a
mountain
and
desired
to
imitate
them
saw
what
a
good
man
the
captain
is
and
wanted
to
be
like
him
the
darned
old
cuss
seeing
him
often
convey
his
hand
to
his
bosom
i
ascribed
his
unparalleled
excellence
to
the
possession
of
some
sovereign
talisman
tickell
managed
to
translate
this
sentence
all
but
the
word
talisman
which
he
rendered
with
all
a
caution
finding
him
about
to
depart
to
the
regions
of
the
blessed
where
such
auxiliaries
are
not
needed
and
being
eager
to
emulate
his
perfections
here
below
i
came
softly
to
the
place
where
he
lay
when
i
saw
him
going
to
slip
his
cable
i
wanted
to
be
as
good
a
fellow
as
he
is
so
i
crept
alongside
and
gently
and
without
force
made
myself
proprietor
of
the
amulet
and
inheritor
of
a
good
man
qualities
and
quietly
boned
the
article
and
the
captain
virtues
i
do
know
what
the
beggar
means
then
a
traitor
with
a
dark
skin
but
darker
soul
then
another
nigger
came
furiously
and
misappropriated
the
charm
thus
piously
obtained
ran
in
and
stole
it
from
me
and
bereft
me
of
the
excellences
i
was
inheriting
and
here
sharpe
interrupted
the
dialogue
by
putting
the
misappropriator
of
other
men
virtues
in
irons
and
the
surgeon
insisted
on
the
cabin
being
cleared
but
dodd
would
not
part
with
the
three
friends
yet
he
begged
them
to
watch
him
and
see
nobody
else
came
to
take
his
children
fortune
i
sink
or
swim
with
it
but
oh
i
doubt
we
shall
have
no
luck
while
it
is
aboard
me
i
never
had
a
pirate
alongside
before
in
all
these
years
what
is
this
here
something
in
it
now
something
hard
something
heavy
and
why
it
a
bullet
on
this
announcement
an
eager
inspection
took
place
and
sure
enough
a
bullet
had
passed
through
dodd
coat
and
waistcoat
and
through
the
oilskin
and
the
leather
pocketbook
and
just
dented
the
hard
cash
no
more
there
was
a
shower
of
comments
and
congratulations
the
effect
of
this
discovery
on
the
sick
man
spirits
was
remarkable
i
was
a
villain
to
belie
it
said
he
it
is
my
wife
and
my
children
and
it
has
saved
my
life
for
he
kissed
it
and
placed
it
in
his
bosom
and
soon
after
sunk
into
a
peaceful
slumber
the
excitement
had
not
the
ill
effect
the
surgeon
feared
it
somewhat
exhausted
him
and
he
slept
long
but
on
awakening
was
pronounced
out
of
danger
to
tell
the
truth
the
tide
had
turned
in
his
favour
overnight
and
it
was
to
convey
the
good
news
on
deck
the
surgeon
had
left
him
while
dodd
was
recovering
the
was
beating
westward
with
light
but
contrary
winds
and
a
good
month
elapsed
without
any
incident
affecting
the
hard
cash
whose
singular
adventures
i
have
to
record
in
this
dearth
please
put
up
with
a
little
characteristic
trifle
which
did
happen
one
moonlight
night
fullalove
lay
coiled
below
decks
in
deep
abstraction
meditating
a
patent
and
being
in
shadow
and
silent
he
saw
vespasian
in
the
moonlight
creeping
on
all
fours
like
a
guilty
thing
into
the
bedroom
of
colonel
kenealy
then
fast
asleep
a
horrible
suspicion
thrilled
through
fullalove
a
suspicion
he
waited
grimly
to
verify
the
transatlantic
mixture
fullalove
was
not
merely
an
inventor
a
philanthrope
a
warrior
a
preacher
a
hunter
a
swimmer
a
fiddler
a
sharp
fellow
a
good
fellow
a
puritan
and
a
bohemian
he
was
also
a
theorist
and
his
theory
which
dub
we
the
african
theory
had
two
branches
that
the
races
of
men
started
equal
but
accident
upon
accident
had
walked
some
tribes
up
a
ladder
of
civilisation
and
kicked
others
down
it
and
left
others
standing
at
the
foot
that
the
good
work
of
centuries
could
be
done
at
a
pinch
in
a
few
generations
by
artificial
condensation
of
the
favourable
circumstances
for
instance
secure
this
worker
in
ebony
years
life
and
he
would
sign
a
penal
bond
to
produce
negroes
of
the
fourth
descent
equal
in
mind
to
the
best
contemporary
white
you
can
breed
brains
said
he
under
any
skin
as
inevitably
as
fat
it
takes
time
and
the
right
crosses
but
so
does
fat
or
rather
it
did
for
fat
is
an
institution
and
here
our
republican
must
have
a
slap
at
thrones
compare
said
he
the
opportunities
of
these
distinguished
gentlemen
and
ladies
with
their
acts
their
seats
have
been
high
but
their
minds
low
i
swan
they
have
been
breeders
for
ages
and
known
the
two
rudiments
of
the
science
have
crossed
and
crossed
for
grenadiers
racehorses
poultry
and
and
bred
in
and
in
for
fools
but
which
of
them
has
ever
aspired
to
breed
a
newton
a
pascal
a
shakespeare
a
solon
a
raphael
yet
all
these
were
results
to
be
obtained
by
the
right
crosses
as
surely
as
a
swift
horse
or
a
circular
sow
now
fancy
breeding
shorthorns
when
you
might
breed
long
so
vespasian
was
to
engender
young
africa
he
was
to
be
first
elevated
morally
and
intellectually
as
high
as
he
would
go
and
then
set
to
breed
his
partner
of
course
to
be
elected
by
fullalove
and
educated
as
high
as
she
would
consent
to
without
an
illicit
connection
with
the
experimentalist
he
would
be
down
on
their
pickaninnies
before
the
parents
could
transfer
the
remnant
of
their
own
weaknesses
to
them
polysyllables
included
and
would
polish
these
ebony
chips
and
at
the
next
cross
reckoned
to
rear
a
genius
by
which
time
as
near
as
he
could
calculate
he
the
theorist
would
be
in
his
dotage
and
all
the
better
make
a
curious
contrast
in
favour
of
young
africa
vespasian
could
not
hit
a
barn
door
sitting
with
a
rifle
it
was
purely
with
a
view
to
his
moral
improvement
mind
you
that
fullalove
invited
him
into
the
mizentop
to
fight
the
pirate
the
patient
came
gingerly
and
shivered
there
with
fear
but
five
minutes
elapsing
and
he
not
killed
that
weakness
gave
way
to
a
jocund
recklessness
and
he
kept
them
all
gay
with
his
quaint
remarks
of
which
i
must
record
but
one
when
they
crossed
the
stern
of
the
pirate
the
distance
was
so
small
that
the
faces
of
that
motley
crew
were
plainly
visible
now
vespasian
was
a
merciless
critic
of
coloured
skins
wal
said
he
turning
up
his
nose
dis
child
never
seen
such
a
mixallaneous
biling
darkies
as
this
yar
why
darned
ef
there
ai
every
colour
in
the
rainbow
from
the
ace
of
spades
down
to
the
fine
dissolving
this
amazing
description
coupled
with
his
look
of
affront
and
disgust
made
the
white
men
roar
for
men
fighting
for
their
lives
have
a
greater
tendency
to
laugh
than
one
would
think
possible
fullalove
was
proud
of
the
critic
and
for
a
while
lost
sight
of
the
pirate
in
his
theory
which
also
may
seem
strange
but
your
true
theorist
is
a
man
apart
he
can
withdraw
into
himself
under
difficulties
what
said
one
of
the
breed
two
thousand
years
ago
media
inter
praelia
semper
sideribus
coelique
plagis
superisque
oh
the
great
african
heart
said
fullalove
after
the
battle
by
my
side
he
fears
no
danger
of
all
men
negroes
are
the
most
capable
of
friendship
their
affection
is
a
mine
and
we
have
only
worked
it
with
the
lash
and
that
is
a
ridiculous
mining
tool
i
rather
when
vespasian
came
out
so
strong
ramgolam
fullalove
was
even
more
triumphant
for
after
all
it
is
not
so
much
the
heart
as
the
intelligence
of
the
negro
we
albiculi
affect
to
doubt
oh
the
great
african
intellect
said
fullalove
publicly
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
i
know
said
beresford
maliciously
it
is
down
in
the
maps
as
the
great
african
to
balance
his
many
excellences
vespasian
had
an
infirmity
this
was
an
ungovernable
itch
for
brushing
whites
if
he
was
talking
with
one
of
that
always
admired
and
now
beloved
race
and
saw
a
speck
of
dirt
on
him
he
would
brush
him
unobtrusively
but
effectually
in
full
dialogue
he
would
steal
behind
a
knot
of
whites
and
brush
whoever
needed
it
however
little
fullalove
remonstrated
but
in
vain
on
this
one
point
instinct
would
not
yield
to
reason
he
could
not
keep
his
hands
off
a
dusty
white
he
would
have
died
of
the
miller
of
dee
but
the
worst
was
he
did
not
stop
at
clothes
he
loathed
shoes
woe
to
all
that
did
not
shine
his
own
skin
furnished
a
perilous
standard
of
comparison
he
was
eternally
blacking
boots
fullalove
got
in
a
rage
at
this
and
insisted
on
his
letting
his
leather
alone
vespasian
pleaded
hard
especially
for
leave
to
black
colonel
kenealy
the
cunnell
said
he
pathetically
is
such
a
tarnation
fine
gentleman
spoilt
for
want
of
a
lilly
bit
of
fullalove
replied
that
the
colonel
had
got
a
servant
whose
mission
it
was
to
black
his
shoes
this
simply
amused
vespasian
a
servant
said
he
yah
yah
what
is
the
use
of
white
servants
they
are
not
biddable
massa
fullalove
sar
goramighty
he
reared
all
white
men
to
kick
up
a
dust
white
servants
inspecially
and
the
darkies
to
brush
and
likewise
additionally
to
make
their
boots
she
a
lilly
he
concluded
with
a
dark
hint
that
the
colonel
white
own
shoes
though
better
blacked
than
his
master
were
anything
but
mirrors
and
that
this
child
had
his
eye
on
them
the
black
desperado
emerged
on
tiptoe
from
kenealy
cabin
just
as
macbeth
does
from
the
murdered
duncan
chamber
only
with
a
pair
of
boots
in
his
hand
instead
of
a
pair
of
daggers
got
into
the
moonlight
and
finding
himself
uninterrupted
assumed
the
whistle
of
innocence
and
polished
them
to
the
nine
chuckling
audibly
fullalove
watched
him
with
an
eye
like
a
rattlesnake
but
kept
quiet
he
saw
interference
would
only
demoralise
him
worse
for
it
is
more
ignoble
to
black
boots
clandestinely
than
bravely
men
ditto
he
relieved
his
heart
with
idioms
darn
the
critter
he
fixed
my
flint
eternally
now
i
cave
i
swan
to
man
i
may
just
hang
up
my
fiddle
for
this
darkie
too
hard
a
row
to
it
was
but
a
momentary
dejection
the
mixture
was
inter
alia
a
theorist
and
an
two
indomitables
he
concluded
to
temporise
with
the
brush
and
breed
it
out
i
bound
to
cross
the
obsequious
cuss
with
the
catawamptiousest
gal
in
guinea
and
one
that
never
saw
a
blacking
bottle
not
even
in
a
being
now
about
a
hundred
miles
south
of
the
mauritius
in
fine
weather
with
a
light
breeze
dodd
marine
barometer
began
to
fall
steadily
and
by
the
afternoon
the
declension
had
become
so
remarkable
that
he
felt
uneasy
and
somewhat
to
the
surprise
of
the
crew
for
there
was
now
scarce
a
breath
of
air
furled
his
slight
sails
treble
reefed
his
topsails
had
his
and
royal
yards
and
gaff
topsail
bent
on
deck
got
his
flying
in
and
made
the
ship
snug
kenealy
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
barometer
going
down
moon
at
the
full
and
jonah
aboard
was
the
reply
uttered
doggedly
kenealy
assured
him
it
was
a
beautiful
evening
precursor
of
a
fine
day
see
how
red
the
sunset
is
red
and
morning
grey
are
the
sure
signs
of
a
fine
day
dodd
looked
and
shook
his
head
the
sun
was
red
but
the
wrong
red
an
angry
red
and
as
he
dipped
into
the
wave
discharged
a
lurid
coppery
hue
that
rushed
in
a
moment
like
an
embodied
menace
over
the
entire
heavens
the
wind
ceased
altogether
and
in
the
middle
of
an
unnatural
and
suspicious
calm
the
glass
went
down
down
down
the
moon
rose
and
instantly
all
eyes
were
bent
on
her
with
suspicion
for
in
this
latitude
the
hurricanes
generally
come
at
the
full
moon
she
was
tolerably
clear
however
but
a
light
scud
sailing
across
her
disc
showed
there
was
wind
in
the
upper
regions
dodd
trusted
to
science
barred
the
and
had
the
dead
lights
put
into
the
stem
cabin
and
secured
then
turned
in
for
an
hour
sleep
science
proved
a
prophet
just
at
seven
bells
in
one
moment
like
a
thunderbolt
from
the
sky
a
heavy
squall
struck
the
ship
under
a
less
careful
captain
her
would
have
been
open
and
she
might
have
gone
to
the
bottom
like
a
bullet
let
go
the
main
sheet
roared
sharpe
hastily
to
a
hand
he
had
placed
there
on
purpose
he
let
go
and
there
was
the
sail
flapping
like
thunder
and
the
sheet
lashing
everything
in
the
most
dangerous
way
dodd
was
on
deck
in
a
moment
helm
hard
up
hands
shorten
sail
pipe
all
hands
furl
sail
ahoy
up
tumbled
the
crew
went
cheerily
to
work
and
by
three
bells
in
the
middle
watch
had
hauled
up
what
was
left
of
the
shivered
mainsail
and
hove
the
ship
to
under
main
topsail
and
storm
and
so
the
voyage
was
suspended
a
heavy
sea
got
up
under
a
scourging
wind
that
rose
and
rose
till
the
under
the
pressure
of
that
single
sail
treble
reefed
heeled
over
so
as
to
dip
her
lee
channels
this
went
on
till
the
waves
rolled
so
high
and
the
squalls
were
so
bitter
that
sheets
of
water
were
actually
torn
off
their
crests
and
launched
incessantly
on
deck
not
only
drenching
dodd
and
his
officers
which
they
did
not
mind
but
threatening
to
flood
the
ship
dodd
battened
down
the
hatches
and
stopped
that
game
then
came
a
danger
no
skill
could
avert
the
ship
lurched
so
violently
now
as
not
merely
to
clip
but
bury
her
lower
deck
and
so
a
good
deal
of
water
found
ingress
through
the
windage
then
dodd
set
a
gang
to
the
pumps
for
he
said
we
can
hardly
hope
to
weather
this
out
without
shipping
a
sea
and
i
wo
have
water
coming
in
upon
and
now
the
wind
raging
and
roaring
like
discharges
of
artillery
and
not
like
wind
as
known
in
our
seas
seemed
to
have
put
out
all
the
lights
of
heaven
the
sky
was
inky
black
and
quite
close
to
their
heads
and
the
wind
still
increasing
the
vessel
came
down
to
her
extreme
bearings
and
it
was
plain
she
would
soon
be
on
her
beam
ends
sharpe
and
dodd
met
and
holding
on
by
the
applied
their
speaking
trumpets
tight
to
each
other
ears
and
even
then
they
had
to
bawl
she
ca
carry
a
rag
much
no
sir
not
half
an
can
we
furl
that
main
taupsle
sharpe
shook
his
head
the
first
moment
we
start
a

the
sail
will
whip
the
mast
out
of
you
are
right
well
then
i
cut
it
volunteers
sir
ay
twelve
no
more
send
them
to
my
sharpe
difficulty
was
to
keep
the
men
back
so
eager
were
the
fine
fellows
to
risk
their
lives
however
he
brought
twelve
to
the
cabin
headed
by
grey
who
had
a
right
as
captain
of
the
watch
to
go
with
them
on
which
right
he
insisted
in
spite
of
dodd
earnest
request
that
he
would
forego
it
when
dodd
saw
his
resolution
he
dropped
the
friend
and
resumed
the
captain
and
spoke
to
them
through
a
trumpet
the
first
time
he
had
ever
used
one
in
a
cabin
or
seen
one
used
mr
grey
and
men
going
aloft
to
save
the
mainmast
by
cutting
the
sail
ay
ay
sir
service
of
danger
great
danger
hurrah
but
great
dangers
can
be
made
smaller
by
working
the
right
way
attend
lay
out
all
on
the
yard
and
take
your
time
from
one
man
at
the
lee
do
know
who
that
will
be
but
one
of
the
smartest
men
in
the
ship
order
to
is
hold
his
knife
hand
well
up
rest
to
see
and
then
in
knives
altogether
mind
and
cut
from
you
and
below
the
reef
band
and
then
i
hope
to
see
all
come
down
grey
and
his
twelve
men
left
the
cabin
and
hey
for
the
main
top
the
men
let
the
officer
lead
them
as
far
as
jacob
ladder
and
then
hurrah
for
the
lee
that
was
where
all
wanted
to
be
and
but
one
could
be
grey
was
as
anxious
as
the
rest
but
officers
of
his
rank
seldom
go
aloft
and
soon
fall
out
of
their
catlike
habits
he
had
done
about
six
ratlines
when
instead
of
going
hand
over
head
he
spread
his
arms
to
seize
a
shroud
on
each
side
of
him
by
this
he
weakened
his
leverage
and
the
wind
just
then
came
fiercer
caught
him
and
flattened
him
against
the
rigging
as
tight
as
if
nature
had
caught
up
a
mountain
for
a
hammer
and
nailed
him
with
a
cedar
he
was
the
men
accepted
him
at
once
as
a
new
patent
ratline
with
a
fine
resisting
power
they
went
up
him
and
bounded
three
ordinary
ratlines
at
a
go
off
all
his
promontories
especially
his
shoulders
and
his
head
receiving
his
compliments
in
the
shape
of
hearty
curses
they
gained
the
top
and
lay
out
on
the
yard
with
their
hair
flying
like
streamers
and
who
got
the
place
of
honour
but
thompson
the
jolly
who
stand
smoked
so
strong
and
so
weak
are
men
thompson
raised
his
knife
high
there
was
a
pause
then
in
went
all
their
knives
and
away
went
the
sail
into
the
night
of
the
storm
and
soon
seemed
a
sheet
of
and
more
likely
to
hit
the
sky
than
the
sea
the
men
came
down
picked
their
officer
off
the
rigging
had
a
dram
in
the
captain
cabin
and
saw
him
enter
their
names
in
the
for
good
service
and
in
the
purser
for
extra
grog
on
sundays
from
there
to
gravesend
the
ship
was
relieved
and
all
looked
well
till
the
chronometer
their
only
guide
now
announced
sunset
when
the
wind
incredible
as
it
may
appear
increased
and
one
frightful
squall
dipped
the
muzzles
of
the
lee
carronades
in
the
water
then
was
heard
the
first
cry
of
distress
an
appalling
sound
the
wail
of
brave
men
and
they
had
borne
it
all
so
bravely
so
cheerfully
till
now
but
now
they
knew
something
must
go
or
else
the
ship
the
suspense
was
awful
but
very
short
crack
crash
the
fore
and
main
topmast
both
gone
short
off
by
the
caps
and
the
ship
recovered
slowly
hesitatingly
tremblingly
relieving
her
from
one
danger
this
subjected
her
to
another
and
a
terrible
one
the
heavy
spars
that
had
fallen
unable
to
break
loose
from
the
rigging
pounded
the
ship
so
savagely
as
to
threaten
to
stave
in
her
side
add
to
this
that
with
labouring
so
long
and
severely
some
of
the
ship
seams
began
now
to
open
and
shut
and
discharge
the
oakum
which
is
terrible
to
the
bravest
seamen
yet
neither
this
stout
captain
nor
his
crew
shirked
any
danger
men
had
ever
grappled
with
since
men
were
dodd
ordered
them
to
cut
away
the
wreck
to
leeward
it
was
done
then
to
windward
this
the
more
ticklish
operation
was
also
done
smartly
the
wreck
passed
under
the
ship
quarter
and
she
drifted
clear
of
it
they
breathed
again
at
eight
bells
in
the
first
watch
it
began
to
thunder
and
lighten
furiously
but
the
thunder
though
close
was
quite
inaudible
in
the
tremendous
uproar
of
the
wind
and
sea
it
blew
a
hurricane
there
were
no
more
squalls
now
but
one
continuous
tornado
which
in
its
passage
through
that
great
gaunt
skeleton
the
ship
rigging
and
bare
poles
howled
and
yelled
and
roared
so
terrifically
as
would
have
silenced
a
salvo
of
artillery
fired
alongside
the
overwhelming
sea
ran
in
dark
watery
mountains
crested
with
devilish
fire
the
inky
blackness
added
supernatural
horror
the
wrath
of
the
almighty
seemed
upon
them
and
his
hand
to
drop
the
black
sky
down
on
them
for
their
funeral
pall
surely
noah
from
his
ark
saw
nothing
more
terrible
what
is
that
close
on
the
lee
bow
chose
the
flash
of
a
gun
another
another
another
a
ship
in
distress
firing
in
their
ears
yet
no
sound
human
thunder
silenced
as
god
thunder
was
silenced
by
the
uproar
of
his
greater
creatures
in
their
mad
rage
the
fired
two
to
let
the
other
poor
ship
know
she
had
a
companion
in
her
helplessness
and
her
distress
and
probably
a
companion
in
her
fate
even
this
companionship
added
its
mite
of
danger
for
both
ships
were
mere
playthings
of
the
elements
they
might
be
tossed
together
and
then
what
would
be
their
fate
two
eggs
clashed
together
in
a
great
boiling
caldron
and
all
the
life
spilt
out
yet
did
each
flash
shoot
a
ray
of
humanity
and
sympathy
into
the
thick
black
supernatural
horror
and
now
came
calamity
upon
calamity
a
tremendous
sea
broke
the
tiller
at
the
and
not
only
was
the
ship
in
danger
of
falling
off
and
shipping
the
sea
but
the
rudder
hammered
her
awfully
and
bade
fair
to
stave
in
her
counter
which
is
another
word
for
destruction
thus
death
came
at
them
with
two
hands
open
at
once
these
vessels
always
carry
a
spare
tiller
they
tried
to
ship
it
but
the
difficulty
was
prodigious
no
light
but
the
miserable
one
glowworm
in
egypt
supernaturally
darkened
the
never
on
an
even
keel
and
heeling
over
like
a
seesaw
more
than
a
ship
and
then
every
time
they
did
place
the
tiller
and
get
the
strain
on
with
their
luff
tackles
the
awful
sea
gave
it
a
blow
and
knocked
it
away
like
a
hair
at
last
they
hit
it
off
or
thought
they
had
for
the
ponderous
thumps
of
the
rudder
ceased
entirely
however
the
ship
did
not
obey
this
new
tiller
like
the
old
one
her
head
fell
off
in
an
unlucky
moment
when
seven
waves
were
rolling
in
one
and
on
coming
to
the
windward
again
she
shipped
a
sea
it
came
in
over
her
bow
transversely
broke
as
high
as
the
mainstay
and
hid
and
buried
the
whole
ship
before
the
mast
carried
away
the
waist
bulwarks
on
both
sides
filled
the
launch
and
drowned
the
live
stock
which
were
in
it
swept
four
and
three
men
away
into
the
sea
like
corks
and
straws
and
sent
tons
of
water
down
the
forescuttle
and
main
hatchway
which
was
partly
opened
not
to
stifle
the
crew
and
flooded
the
dodd
who
was
in
his
cabin
sent
the
whole
crew
to
the
pumps
except
the
men
at
the
wheel
and
prepared
for
the
worst
in
men
so
brave
as
he
was
when
hope
dies
fear
dies
his
chief
care
now
was
to
separate
the
fate
of
those
he
loved
from
his
own
he
took
a
bottle
inserted
the
fatal
money
in
it
with
a
few
words
of
love
to
his
wife
and
of
direction
to
any
stranger
that
should
fall
in
with
it
secured
the
cork
with
melted
tied
oilskin
over
it
and
melted
wax
on
that
applied
a
preparation
to
the
glass
to
close
the
pores
and
to
protect
it
against
other
accidents
and
attract
attention
fastened
a
black
painted
bladder
to
it
by
a
stout
tarred
twine
and
painted
lost
at
sea
in
white
on
the
bladder
he
had
logged
each
main
incident
of
the
storm
with
that
curt
accuracy
which
reads
so
cold
and
small
a
record
of
these
great
and
terrible
tragedies
he
now
made
a
final
entry
a
little
more
in
character
with
the
situation
about
eight
bells
in
the
morning
watch
shipped
a
heavy
sea
forward
the
rudder
being
now
damaged
and
the
ship
hardly
manageable
brought
the
log
and
case
on
check
expecting
to
founder
shortly
sun
and
moon
hidden
this
two
days
and
no
observation
possible
but
by
calculation
of
wind
and
current
we
should
be
about
fifty
miles
to
the
southward
of
the
mauritius
god
will
be
he
got
on
deck
with
the
bottle
in
his
pocket
and
the
bladder
peeping
out
put
the
log
and
its
case
down
on
deck
and
by
means
of
the
crawled
along
on
his
knees
and
with
great
difficulty
to
the
wheel
finding
the
men
could
hardly
hold
on
and
dreading
another
sea
dodd
with
his
own
hands
lashed
them
to
the
helm
while
thus
employed
he
felt
the
ship
give
a
slight
roll
a
very
slight
roll
to
windward
his
experienced
eye
lightened
with
hope
he
cast
his
eager
glance
to
leeward
there
it
is
a
sailor
looks
for
the
first
spark
of
hope
ay
thereaway
was
a
little
gleam
of
light
he
patted
the
helmsman
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
to
it
for
now
neither
could
one
man
speak
for
the
wind
nor
another
hear
the
sailor
nodded
joyfully
presently
the
continuous
tornado
broke
into
squalls
hope
grew
brighter
but
unfortunately
in
one
furious
squall
the
ship
broke
round
off
so
as
to
present
her
quarter
to
the
sea
at
an
unlucky
moment
for
it
came
seven
deep
again
a
roaring
mountain
and
hurled
itself
over
her
stern
and
quarter
the
mighty
mass
struck
her
stem
frame
with
the
weight
of
a
hundred
thousand
tons
of
water
and
drove
her
forward
as
a
boy
launches
his
on
a
pond
and
though
she
made
so
little
resistance
stove
in
the
dead
lights
and
the
port
frames
burst
through
the
cabin
bulkheads
and
washed
out
all
the
furniture
and
colonel
kenealy
in
his
nightgown
with
a
table
in
his
arms
borne
on
water
three
feet
deep
and
carried
him
under
the
poop
awning
away
to
the
lee
scuppers
and
flooded
the
lower
deck
above
it
swept
the
clean
of
everything
except
the
shrieking
helmsmen
washed
dodd
away
like
a
cork
and
would
have
carried
him
overboard
if
he
had
not
brought
up
against
the
mainmast
and
grasped
it
like
grim
death
half
drowned
half
stunned
sorely
bruised
and
gasping
like
a
porpoise
ashore
he
held
on
by
the
mast
in
water
and
foam
panting
he
rolled
his
despairing
eyes
around
the
bulwarks
fore
and
aft
were
all
in
ruins
with
wide
chasms
as
between
the
battlements
of
some
decayed
castle
and
through
the
gaps
he
saw
the
sea
yawning
wide
for
him
he
dare
not
move
no
man
was
safe
a
moment
unless
lashed
to
mast
or
helm
he
held
on
expecting
death
but
presently
it
struck
him
he
could
see
much
farther
than
before
he
looked
up
it
was
clearing
overhead
and
the
uproar
abating
visibly
and
now
the
wind
did
not
decline
as
after
a
gale
extraordinary
to
the
last
it
blew
itself
out
sharpe
came
on
deck
and
crawled
on
all
fours
to
his
captain
and
helped
him
to
a
he
held
on
by
it
and
gave
his
orders
the
wind
was
blown
out
but
the
sea
was
as
dangerous
as
ever
the
ship
began
to
roll
to
windward
if
that
was
not
stopped
her
fate
was
sealed
dodd
had
the
main
trysail
set
and
then
the
fore
trysail
before
he
would
yield
to
go
below
though
drenched
and
sore
and
hungry
and
worn
out
those
sails
steadied
the
ship
the
sea
began
to
go
down
by
degrees
the
celestial
part
of
nature
was
more
generous
away
flew
every
cloud
out
came
the
heavenly
sky
bluer
and
lovelier
than
ever
they
had
seen
it
the
sun
flamed
in
its
centre
nature
after
three
days
eclipse
was
so
lovely
it
seemed
a
new
heavens
and
a
new
earth
if
there
was
an
infidel
on
board
who
did
not
believe
in
god
now
his
soul
felt
him
in
spite
of
the
poor
little
head
as
for
dodd
who
was
naturally
pious
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
that
lovely
sky
in
heartfelt
though
silent
gratitude
to
its
maker
for
saving
the
ship
and
cargo
and
her
people
lives
not
forgetting
the
private
treasure
he
was
carrying
home
to
his
dear
wife
and
children
with
this
thought
he
naturally
looked
down
but
missed
the
bladder
that
had
lately
protruded
from
his
pocket
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
pocket
all
in
a
flutter
the
bottle
was
gone
in
a
fever
of
alarm
and
anxiety
but
with
good
hopes
of
finding
it
he
searched
the
deck
he
looked
in
every
cranny
behind
every
coil
of
rope
the
sea
had
not
carried
away
in
vain
the
sea
acting
on
the
buoyant
bladder
attached
had
clearly
torn
the
bottle
out
of
his
pocket
when
it
washed
him
against
the
mast
his
treasure
then
must
have
been
driven
much
farther
and
how
far
who
could
tell
it
flashed
on
the
poor
man
with
fearful
distinctness
that
it
must
either
have
been
picked
up
by
somebody
in
the
ship
ere
now
or
else
carried
out
to
sea
strict
inquiry
was
made
amongst
the
men
no
one
had
seen
it
the
fruit
of
his
toil
and
prudence
the
treasure
love
not
avarice
had
twined
with
his
heartstrings
was
gone
in
its
defence
he
had
defeated
two
pirates
each
his
superior
in
force
and
now
conquered
the
elements
at
their
maddest
and
in
the
very
moment
of
that
great
victory
it
was
gone
chapter
xii
in
the
narrative
of
home
events
i
skipped
a
little
business
not
quite
colourless
but
irrelevant
to
the
love
passages
then
on
hand
it
has
however
a
connection
with
the
curious
events
now
converging
to
a
point
so
with
the
reader
permission
i
will
place
it
in
logical
sequence
disregarding
the
order
of
time
the
day
sampson
splashed
among
the
ducks
and
one
of
them
hid
till
dinner
the
rest
were
seated
at
luncheon
when
two
patients
were
announced
as
waiting
and
maxley
sampson
refused
to
see
them
on
this
ground
i
will
not
feed
and
but
dodd
interceded
and
he
yielded
well
then
show
them
in
here
they
are
better
cracters
than
on
this
a
stout
woman
the
picture
of
health
was
ushered
in
and
curtseyed
all
round
well
what
is
the
matter
now
inquired
sampson
rather
roughly
be
seated
maxley
said
dodd
benignly
i
thank
ye
kindly
and
she
sat
down
doctor

bitter

and
i
feel
as

or

that
i
poor
woman
said
dodd
oh

is
dead
yet
cried
sampson
cheerfully
she
sell
addled
eggs
over
all
our
tombstones
that
is
to
say
if
she
minds
what
i
bid
her
when
was
your
last
spasm

that
yestereen
and
so
i
said

cause

my
pain
he
says

the
cause
ay
the
cause
just
obsairve
jintlemen
said
sampson
addressing
imaginary
students
how
startled
they
all
are
if
a
docker
deviates
from
profissional
habits
into
sceince
and
takes
the
right
eend
of
the
stick
for
once
b
asking
for
the
the
cause

the
will
of

sampson
angrily

his
oar
he
does
not
mean
the
cause
he
means
the
cause
my
poor
dear
creature
i
bai
no
latiner
objected
the
patient
sampson
fixed
his
eyes
sternly
on
the
slippery
dame

i
want
to
know
is
had

been
running
or
eating
fast

killed

sarvant
all
the
dodd
hoped
the
poor
woman
had
nothing
very
serious
the
matter
oh
it
is
a
mortal
disease
replied
sampson
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
she
has
got
angina
pictoris
or
a
disorder
that
admirably
eximplifies
the
pretinsions
of
midicine
t
and
with
this
he
dashed
into
monologue
maxley
tall
gaunt
form
came
slouching
in
and
traversed
the
floor
pounding
it
with
heavy
nailed
boots
he
seated
himself
gravely
at
dodd
invitation
took
a
handkerchief
out
of
his
hat
wiped
his
face
and
surveyed
the
company
grand
and
calm
in
james
maxley
all
was
ponderous
his
head
was
huge
his
mouth
when
it
fairly
opened
revealed
a
chasm
and
thence
issued
a
voice
naturally
stentorian
by
its
volume
and
native
vigour
but
when
the
owner
of
this
incarnate
bassoon
had
a
mind
to
say
something
sagacious
he
sank
at
once
from
his
habitual
roar
to
a
sound
scarce
above
a
whisper
a
contrast
mighty
comical
to
hear
though
on
paper
well
what
is
it
maxley
rheumatism
again
no
that
it
ai
bellowed
maxley
defiantly
what
then
come
look
well
then
doctor
i
tell
you
i
sore
troubled
with
a
this
malady
announced
in
the
tone
of
a
proclamation
and
coming
after
so
much
solemn
preparation
amused
the
party
considerably
although
parturient
mountains
had
ere
then
produced
muscipular
abortions
a
mouse
inquired
sampson
disdainfully
where
up
your
sleeve
come
to
me
go
t
a
sawbones
and
have
your
arm
cut
off
i
seen
mutilate
a
pashint
for
as
maxley
said
it
was
not
up
his
sleeve
worse
luck
on
this
alfred
hazarded
a
conjecture
might
it
not
have
gone
down
his
throat
took
his
for
the
ha
ha
ay
i
hear
ye
young
man
at
your
own
sport
said
maxley
winking
his
eye
but
the
biggest
mouth
as
catches
the
most
you
sits
yander
fit
to
bust
but
with
a
roar
like
a
lion
ye
never
offers
none
o
neither
sup
nor
at
this
sudden
turn
of
maxley
wit
light
and
playful
as
a
tap
of
the
old
english
they
were
a
little
staggered
all
but
edward
who
laughed
and
supplied
him
zealously
with
sandwiches
you
a
gentleman
you
are
said
maxley
looking
full
at
sampson
and
alfred
to
point
the
contradistinction
having
thus
disposed
of
his
satirists
he
contemplated
the
sandwiches
with
an
inquiring
and
philosophic
eye
well
said
he
after
long
and
thoughtful
inspection
you
gentlefoiks
wo
die
of
hard
work
your
sarvants
must
cut
the
very
meat
to
fit
your
and
not
to
fall
behind
the
gentry
in
a
great
and
useful
department
of
intelligence
he
made
precisely
one
mouthful
of
each
sandwich
dodd
was
secretly
amazed
and
taking
care
not
to
be
noticed
by
maxley
said
confidentially
monsieur
avait
bien
raison
le
souris
a
passe
par
the
plate
cleared
and
washed
down
with
a
tumbler
of
port
maxley
resumed
and
informed
the
doctor
that
the
mouse
was
at
this
moment
in
his
garden
eating
his
bulbs
and
i
be
come
here
to
put
an
end
to
her
if
i
any
luck
at
sampson
told
him
he
need
trouble
nature
has
put
an
end
to
her
as
long
as
her
maxley
was
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
opened
his
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
in
a
guffaw
that
made
the
glasses
ring
his
humour
was
perverse
he
was
and
but
at
a
feeble
jest
would
sometimes
roar
like
a
lion
inflated
with
laughed
he
ever
so
loud
and
long
he
always
ended
abruptly
and
without
gradation
his
laugh
was
a
clean
spadeful
dug
out
of
merriment
he
resumed
his
gravity
and
his
theme
all
in
an
instant
white
arsenic
she
wo
look
at
for
i
tried
her
but
they
tell
me
there
another
sweetmeat
come
up
which
they
call
it
striek
hets
let
the
poor
beasty
alone
life
as
sweet
tit
as
if
was
a
gardener
you
feel
for
the
bulbs
not
for
the
varmin
remonstrated
maxley
rather
arrogantly
but
bein
a
man
of
sceince
i
feel
for
th
higher
organisation
mice
are
a
part
of
nature
as
much
as
so
be
stoats
and
adders
and
sampson
appealed
jintlemen
here
a
pretty
pashint
reflects
on
our
lairned
profission
and
it
never
cost
him
a
guinea
for
the
dog
never
do
let
my
chaff
choke
ye
doctor
that
war
meant
for
altogether
so
if
you
got
a
little
bit
of
that
about
you
i
not
a
ratcatcher
my
man
i
do
go
with
dith
in
my
pocket
like
the
surgeons
that
carry
a
lancet
and
if
i
had
murder
in
both
pockets
you
should
get
any
here
a
greedy
dog
got
a
thousand
pounds
in
the
bank
and
grudges
his
healer
a
guinea
and
his
mouse
a
now
who
have
been
a
telling
you
lies
inquired
maxley
severely
my
missus
for
a
farthing
i
not
a
man
i
a
man
and
it
all
safe
at
here
he
went
from
his
roar
to
his
whisper
i
do
hold
with
lunnon
banks
they
be
like
my
missus
eggs
all
one
outside
and
the
rotten
ones
only
known
by
breaking
well
loud
i
pretty
close
i
do
deny
it
but
confidentially
my
missus
beats
me
i
look
twice
at
a
penny
but
she
looks

the
subsiding
sea
was
now
a
liquid
paradise
its
great
pellucid
braes
and
hillocks
shone
with
the
sparkle
and
the
hues
of
all
the
jewels
in
an
emperor
crown
imagine
after
three
days
of
inky
sea
and
pitchy
sky
and
death
deep
jaws
snapping
and
barely
missing
ten
thousand
great
slopes
of
emerald
aquamarine
amethyst
and
topaz
liquid
alive
and
dancing
jocundly
beneath
a
gorgeous
sun
and
you
will
have
a
faint
idea
of
what
met
the
eyes
and
hearts
of
the
rescued
looking
out
of
that
battered
jagged
ship
upon
ocean
smiling
back
to
smiling
heaven
yet
one
man
felt
no
buoyancy
nor
gush
of
joy
he
leaned
against
a
fragment
of
the
broken
bulwark
confused
between
the
sweetness
of
life
preserved
and
the
bitterness
of
treasure
lost
his
wife
and
treasured
treasure
benumbed
at
heart
and
almost
weary
of
the
existence
he
had
battled
for
so
stoutly
he
looked
so
moody
and
answered
so
grimly
and
unlike
himself
that
they
all
held
aloof
from
him
heavy
heart
among
so
many
joyful
ones
he
was
in
true
solitude
the
body
in
a
crowd
the
soul
alone
and
he
was
sore
as
well
as
heavy
for
of
all
the
lubberly
acts
he
had
ever
known
the
way
he
had
lost
his
dear
fortune
seemed
to
him
the
worst
a
voice
sounded
in
his
ear
poor
thing
she
has
s
it
was
fullalove
scanning
the
horizon
with
his
famous
glass
foundered
who
said
dodd
though
he
did
not
care
much
who
sank
who
swam
then
he
remembered
the
vessel
whose
flashing
guns
had
shed
a
human
ray
on
the
unearthly
horror
of
the
black
hurricane
he
looked
all
round
blank
ay
she
had
perished
with
all
hands
the
sea
had
swallowed
her
and
spared
him
ungrateful
this
turned
his
mind
sharply
suppose
the
had
gone
down
the
money
would
be
lost
as
now
and
his
life
into
the
bargain
a
life
dearer
to
all
at
home
than
millions
of
gold
he
prayed
inwardly
to
heaven
for
gratitude
and
goodness
to
feel
its
mercy
this
softened
him
a
little
and
his
heart
swelled
so
he
wished
he
was
a
woman
to
cry
over
his
children
loss
for
an
hour
and
then
shake
all
off
and
go
through
his
duty
somehow
for
now
he
was
paralysed
and
all
seemed
ended
next
nautical
superstition
fastened
on
him
that
of
his
was
jonah
it
had
to
go
or
else
the
ship
the
moment
it
did
go
the
storm
had
broken
as
by
magic
now
superstition
is
generally
stronger
than
rational
religion
whether
they
lie
apart
or
together
in
one
mind
and
this
superstitious
notion
did
something
toward
steeling
the
poor
man
come
said
he
to
himself
my
loss
has
saved
all
these
poor
souls
on
board
this
ship
so
be
it
heaven
will
be
done
i
must
bustle
or
else
go
he
turned
to
and
worked
like
a
horse
and
with
his
own
hands
helped
the
men
to
rig
parallel
ropes
a
substitute
for
bulwarks
till
the
perspiration
ran
down
him
bayliss
now
reported
the
well
nearly
dry
and
dodd
was
about
to
bear
up
and
make
sail
again
when
one
of
the
a
little
fellow
with
a
bright
eye
and
a
chin
like
a
monkey
came
up
to
him
and
said
please
captain
then
glared
with
awe
at
what
he
had
done
and
broke
down
well
my
little
man
said
dodd
gently
thus
encouraged
the
boy
gave
a
great
gulp
and
burst
in
in
a
brogue
och
your
arnr
sure
there
no
rudder
on
her
at
all
barrin
the
what
d
mean
do
murder
me
your
arnr
and
i
tell
ye
it
meself
looked
over
the
starrn
just
now
and
i
seen
there
was
no
rudder
at
all
at
all
mille
diaoul
sis
i
ye
old
bitch
i
tell
his
arur
what
after
slipping
your
rudder
like
my
granny
list
shoe
i
dodd
ran
to
the
helm
and
looked
down
the
brat
was
right
the
blows
which
had
so
endangered
the
ship
had
broken
the
rudder
and
the
sea
had
washed
away
more
than
half
of
it
the
sight
and
the
reflection
made
him
faintish
for
a
moment
death
passing
so
very
close
to
a
man
sickens
him
unless
he
has
the
luck
to
be
brainless
what
is
your
name
urchin
ned
murphy
very
well
murphy
then
you
are
a
fine
little
fellow
and
have
wiped
all
our
eyes
in
the
ship
run
and
send
the
carpenter
ay
ay
the
carpenter
came
like
most
artisans
he
was
clever
in
a
groove
take
him
out
of
that
and
lo
a
mule
a
pig
an
owl
he
was
not
only
unable
to
invent
but
so
stiffly
disinclined
a
makeshift
rudder
was
clean
out
of
his
way
and
as
his
whole
struggle
was
to
get
away
from
every
suggestion
dodd
made
back
to
groove
aforesaid
the
thing
looked
hopeless
then
fullalove
who
had
stood
by
grinning
offered
to
make
a
bunkum
rudder
provided
the
carpenter
and
mates
were
put
under
his
orders
but
said
he
i
must
bargain
they
shall
be
disrated
if
they
attempt
to
that
is
no
more
than
fair
said
dodd
the
yankee
inventor
demanded
a
spare
maincap
and
cut
away
one
end
of
the
square
piece
so
as
to
make
it
fit
the
through
the
circle
of
the
cap
he
introduced
a
spare
mizen
topmast
to
this
he
seized
a
length
of
junk
another
to
that
another
to
that
and
so
on
to
the
outside
junk
he
seized
a
spare
mast
and
this
conglomerate
being
now
nearly
as
broad
as
a
rudder
he
planked
over
all
the
sea
by
this
time
was
calm
he
got
the
machine
over
the
stern
and
had
the
square
end
of
the
cap
bolted
to
the
he
had
already
fixed
four
spans
of
hawser
to
the
sides
of
the
makeshift
two
fastened
to
tackles
which
led
into
the
gunroom
ports
and
were
housed
taut
these
kept
the
lower
part
of
the
makeshift
close
to
the
stern
post
and
two
to
which
guys
were
now
fixed
and
led
through
the
aftermost
ports
on
to
the
where
tackles
were
attached
to
them
by
means
of
which
the
makeshift
was
to
be
worked
as
a
rudder
some
sail
was
now
got
on
the
ship
and
she
was
found
to
steer
very
well
dodd
tried
her
on
every
tack
and
at
last
ordered
sharpe
to
make
all
sail
and
head
for
the
cape
this
electrified
the
first
mate
the
breeze
was
very
faint
but
southerly
and
the
mauritius
under
their
lee
they
could
make
it
in
a
night
and
there
refit
and
ship
a
new
rudder
he
suggested
the
danger
of
sailing
sixteen
hundred
miles
steered
by
a
gimcrack
and
implored
dodd
to
put
into
port
dodd
answered
with
a
roughness
and
a
certain
wildness
never
seen
in
him
before
danger
sir
there
will
be
no
more
foul
weather
this
voyage
jonah
is
sharpe
stared
an
inquiry
i
tell
you
we
lower
our
topgallants
once
from
this
to
the
cape
jonah
is
overboard
and
he
slapped
his
forehead
in
despair
then
stamping
impatiently
with
his
foot
told
sharpe
his
duty
was
to
obey
orders
not
discuss
them
certainly
sir
said
sharpe
sullenly
and
went
out
of
the
cabin
with
serious
thoughts
of
communicating
to
the
other
mates
an
alarming
suspicion
about
dodd
that
now
for
the
first
time
crossed
his
mind
but
long
habit
of
discipline
prevailed
and
he
made
all
sail
on
the
ship
and
bore
away
for
the
cape
with
a
heavy
heart
the
sea
was
like
a
but
in
that
he
saw
only
its
treachery
to
lead
them
on
to
this
unparalleled
act
of
madness
each
sail
he
hoisted
seemed
one
more
agent
of
destruction
rising
at
his
own
suicidal
command
towards
evening
it
became
nearly
dead
calm
the
sea
heaved
a
little
but
was
waveless
glassy
and
the
colour
of
a
rose
incredibly
brave
and
delicate
the
reported
pieces
of
wreck
to
windward
as
the
ship
was
making
so
little
way
dodd
beat
up
towards
them
he
feared
it
was
a
british
ship
that
had
foundered
in
the
storm
and
thought
it
his
duty
to
ascertain
and
carry
the
sad
news
home
in
two
tacks
they
got
near
enough
to
see
with
their
glasses
that
the
fragments
belonged
not
to
a
stranger
but
to
the
herself
there
was
one
of
her
waterbutts
and
a
broken
mast
with
some
rigging
and
as
more
wreck
was
descried
coming
in
at
a
little
distance
dodd
kept
the
ship
close
to
the
wind
to
inspect
it
on
drifting
near
it
proved
to
be
several
pieces
of
the
bulwark
and
a
mahogany
table
out
of
the
cuddy
this
sort
of
flotsam
was
not
worth
delaying
the
ship
to
pick
it
up
so
dodd
made
sail
again
steering
now
he
had
sailed
about
half
a
mile
when
the
hailed
the
deck
again
a
man
in
the
water
whereabouts
a
short
league
on
the
weather
oh
we
ca
beat
to
windward
for
said
sharpe
he
is
dead
long
holds
his
head
very
high
for
a
corpse
said
the
i
soon
know
cried
dodd
lower
the
gig
i
go
the
gig
was
lowered
and
six
swift
rowers
pulled
him
to
windward
while
the
ship
kept
on
her
course
it
is
most
unusual
for
a
captain
to
leave
the
ship
at
sea
on
such
petty
errands
but
dodd
half
hoped
the
man
might
be
alive
and
he
was
so
unhappy
and
like
his
daughter
who
probably
derived
the
trait
from
him
grasped
instinctively
at
a
chance
of
doing
kindness
to
some
poor
fellow
alive
or
dead
that
would
soothe
his
own
sore
good
heart
when
they
had
pulled
about
two
miles
the
sun
was
sinking
into
the
horizon
give
way
men
said
dodd
or
we
shall
not
be
able
to
see
the
men
bent
to
their
oars
and
made
the
boat
fly
presently
the
coxswain
caught
sight
of
an
object
bobbing
on
the
water
abeam
why
that
must
be
it
said
he
the
lubber
to
take
it
for
a
head
why
it
is
nothing
but
a
thundering
old
bladder
speckled
what
cried
dodd
and
fell
steer
for
it
give
way
ay
ay
sir
they
soon
came
alongside
the
bladder
and
the
coxswain
grabbed
it
hallo
here
something
lashed
to
it
a
bottle
give
it
me
gasped
dodd
in
a
voice
choked
with
agitation
give
it
me
back
to
the
ship
fly
fly
cut
her
off
or
she
give
us
the
slip
he
never
spoke
a
word
more
but
sat
in
a
stupor
of
joyful
wonder
they
soon
caught
the
ship
he
got
into
his
cabin
he
scarce
knew
how
broke
the
bottle
to
atoms
and
found
the
indomitable
cash
uninjured
with
trembling
hands
he
restored
it
to
its
old
place
in
his
bosom
and
sewed
it
tighter
than
ever
until
he
felt
it
there
once
more
he
could
hardly
realise
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
that
seemed
miraculous
though
in
reality
it
was
less
strange
than
the
way
he
had
lost
it
but
now
laid
bodily
on
his
heart
it
set
his
bosom
on
fire
oh
the
bright
eye
the
bounding
pulse
the
buoyant
foot
the
reckless
joy
he
slapped
sharpe
on
the
back
a
little
vulgarly
for
him
jonah
is
on
board
again
old
fellow
look
out
for
being
much
larger
than
the
bottle
had
drifted
faster
to
leeward
in
the
storm
he
uttered
this
foreboding
in
a
tone
of
triumph
and
with
a
gay
elastic
recklessness
which
harmonised
so
well
with
his
makeshift
rudder
that
sharpe
groaned
aloud
and
wished
himself
under
any
captain
in
the
world
but
this
and
in
any
other
ship
he
looked
round
to
make
sure
he
was
not
watched
and
then
tapped
his
forehead
significantly
this
somewhat
relieved
him
and
he
did
his
duty
smartly
for
a
man
going
to
the
bottom
with
his
eyes
open
but
ill
luck
is
not
to
be
bespoken
any
more
than
good
the
seemed
to
have
blown
itself
out
the
wind
veered
to
the
and
breathed
steadily
in
that
quarter
for
ten
days
the
topgallant
sails
were
never
lowered
nor
shifted
day
nor
night
all
that
time
and
not
a
single
danger
occurred
between
this
and
the
cape
except
to
a
monkey
which
i
fear
i
must
relate
on
account
of
its
remoter
consequences
one
fine
afternoon
everybody
was
on
deck
amusing
themselves
as
they
could
beresford
to
wit
was
being
flattered
under
the
poop
awning
by
kenealy
the
feud
between
her
and
dodd
continued
but
under
a
false
impression
the
lady
had
one
advantage
over
the
gentler
specimens
of
her
sex
she
was
never
deterred
from
a
kind
action
by
want
of
pluck
as
they
are
pluck
aquilina
was
brimful
of
it
when
she
found
dodd
was
wounded
she
cast
her
wrongs
to
the
wind
and
offered
to
go
and
nurse
him
her
message
came
at
an
unlucky
moment
and
by
an
unlucky
messenger
the
surgeon
said
hastily
i
ca
have
him
the
stupid
servant
reported
he
ca
be
worried
and
beresford
thinking
dodd
had
a
hand
in
this
answer
was
bitterly
mortified
and
with
some
reason
she
would
have
forgiven
him
though
if
he
had
died
but
as
he
lived
she
thought
she
had
a
right
to
detest
him
and
did
and
showed
her
sentiments
like
a
lady
by
never
speaking
to
him
nor
looking
at
him
but
ignoring
him
with
frigid
magnificence
on
his
own
now
among
the
crew
of
this
ship
was
a
favourite
goat
affectionate
and
playful
but
a
single
vice
counterbalanced
all
his
virtues
he
took
a
drop
a
year
or
two
ago
some
tempter
taught
him
to
sip
grog
he
took
to
it
kindly
and
was
now
arrived
at
such
a
pitch
that
at
he
used
to
butt
his
way
in
among
the
sailors
and
get
close
to
the
canteen
and
by
arrangement
an
allowance
was
always
served
out
to
him
on
imbibing
it
he
passed
with
quadrupedal
rapidity
through
three
stages
the
absurd
the
choleric
the
sleepy
and
was
never
his
own
goat
again
until
he
awoke
from
the
latter
now
master
fred
beresford
encountered
him
in
the
second
stage
of
inebriety
and
being
a
rough
playfellow
tapped
his
nose
with
a
battledore
instantly
billy
butted
at
him
mischievous
fred
screamed
and
jumped
on
the
bulwarks
billy
went
at
him
there
whereupon
the
young
gentleman
with
all
eldrich
screech
and
a
comparative
estimate
of
perils
that
smacked
of
inexperience
fled
into
the
sea
at
the
very
moment
when
his
anxious
mother
was
rushing
to
save
him
she
uttered
a
scream
of
agony
and
would
actually
have
followed
him
but
was
held
back
uttering
shriek
after
shriek
that
pierced
every
heart
within
hearing
but
dodd
saw
the
boy
go
overboard
and
vaulted
over
the
bulwark
near
the
helm
roared
in
the
very
air
heave
the
ship
to
and
went
splash
into
the
water
about
ten
yards
from
the
place
he
was
soon
followed
by
vespasian
and
a
boat
was
lowered
as
quickly
as
possible
dodd
caught
sight
of
a
broad
straw
hat
on
the
top
of
a
wave
swam
lustily
to
it
and
found
freddy
inside
it
was
tied
under
his
chin
and
would
have
floated
goliath
dodd
turned
to
the
ship
saw
the
poor
mother
with
white
face
and
arms
outstretched
as
if
she
would
fly
at
them
and
held
the
urchin
up
high
to
her
with
a
joyful
the
ship
seemed
alive
and
to
hurrah
in
return
with
giant
voice
the
boat
soon
picked
them
up
and
dodd
came
up
the
side
with
freddy
in
his
arms
and
placed
him
in
his
mother
with
honest
pride
and
deep
parental
sympathy
guess
how
she
scolded
and
caressed
her
child
all
in
a
breath
and
sobbed
over
him
for
this
no
human
pen
has
ever
told
nor
ever
will
all
i
can
just
manage
to
convey
is
that
after
she
had
all
but
eaten
the
little
torment
she
suddenly
dropped
him
and
made
a
great
maternal
rush
at
dodd
she
flung
her
arms
round
him
and
kissed
him
eagerly
almost
fiercely
then
carried
away
wild
by
mighty
nature
she
patted
him
all
over
in
the
strangest
way
and
kissed
his
waistcoat
his
arms
his
hands
and
rained
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
on
them
dodd
was
quite
overpowered
no
no
said
he
do
now
pray
do
there
there
i
know
my
dear
i
know
i
a
and
he
was
very
near
whimpering
himself
but
recovered
the
man
and
the
commander
and
said
soothingly
there
there
and
he
handed
her
tenderly
down
to
her
cabin
all
this
time
he
had
actually
forgotten
the
packet
but
now
a
horrible
fear
came
on
him
he
hurried
to
his
own
cabin
and
examined
it
a
little
salt
water
had
oozed
through
the
and
discoloured
the
leather
but
that
was
all
he
breathed
again
thank
heaven
i
forgot
all
about
it
said
he
it
would
have
made
a
cur
of
lady
beresford
petty
irritation
against
dodd
melted
at
once
before
so
great
a
thing
she
longed
to
make
friends
with
him
but
for
once
felt
timid
it
struck
her
now
all
of
a
sudden
that
she
had
been
misbehaving
however
she
caught
dodd
alone
on
the
deck
and
said
to
him
softly
i
want
so
to
end
our
our
quarrel
madam
said
he
why
i
know
of
none
oh
about
the
light
eh
well
you
see
the
master
of
a
ship
is
obliged
to
be
a
tyrant
in
some
i
make
no
complaint
said
the
lady
hastily
and
hung
her
head
all
i
ask
you
is
to
forgive
one
who
has
behaved
like
a
fool
without
even
the
excuse
of
being
one
and
will
you
give
me
your
hand
sir
ay
and
with
all
my
heart
said
dodd
warmly
enclosing
the
soft
little
hand
in
his
honest
grasp
and
with
no
more
ado
these
two
highflyers
ended
one
of
those
little
misunderstandings
petty
spirits
nurse
into
a
feud
the
ship
being
in
port
at
the
cape
and
two
hundred
hammers
tapping
at
her
dodd
went
ashore
in
search
of
captain
robarts
and
made
the
over
to
him
in
the
friendliest
way
adding
warmly
that
he
had
found
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
officers
and
the
crew
to
his
surprise
captain
robarts
received
all
this
ungraciously
you
ought
to
have
remained
on
board
sir
and
made
me
over
the
command
on
the
dodd
replied
politely
that
it
would
have
been
more
formal
suppose
i
return
immediately
and
man
the
side
for
you
and
then
you
board
her
say
in
i
shall
come
when
i
like
replied
robarts
crustily
and
when
will
you
like
to
come
inquired
dodd
with
imperturbable
now
this
moment
and
i
trouble
you
to
come
along
with
certainly
they
got
a
boat
and
went
out
to
the
ship
on
coming
alongside
dodd
thought
to
meet
his
wishes
by
going
first
and
receiving
him
but
the
jealous
fellow
shoved
roughly
before
him
and
led
the
way
up
the
ship
side
sharpe
and
the
rest
saluted
him
he
did
not
return
the
salute
but
said
hoarsely
turn
the
hands
up
to
when
they
were
all
aft
he
noticed
one
or
two
with
their
caps
on
hats
off
and
be
to
you
cried
he
do
you
know
where
you
are
do
you
know
who
you
are
looking
at
if
not
i
show
you
i
here
to
restore
discipline
to
this
ship
so
mind
how
you
run
athwart
my
hawse
do
you
play
with
the
bull
my
men
or
you
find
his
horns
sharp
pipe
down
now
you
sir
bring
me
the
he
ran
his
eye
over
it
and
closed
it
contemptuously
pirates
and
hurricanes
never
fell
in
with
pirates
nor
hurricanes
i
have
heard
of
a
breeze
and
a
gale
but
i
never
knew
a
seaman
worth
his
salt
say
get
another
sharpe
put
down
that
it
begins
this
day
at
noon
and
enter
that
captain
robarts
came
on
deck
found
the
ship
in
a
miserable
condition
took
the
command
mustered
the
officers
and
men
and
stopped
the
ship
company
grog
for
a
week
for
receiving
him
with
hats
even
sharpe
that
walking
obedience
was
taken
aback
stop
the
company
grog
for
a
week
sir
yes
sir
for
a
week
and
if
you
fling
my
orders
back
in
my
face
instead
of
clapping
on
sail
to
execute
them
i
have
you
towed
ashore
on
a
grating
your
name
is
sharpe
well
my
name
is
dammedsharpe
and
so
you
in
short
the
new
captain
came
down
on
the
ship
like
a
blight
he
was
especially
hard
on
dodd
nothing
that
commander
had
done
was
right
nor
had
he
done
the
contrary
would
that
have
been
right
he
was
disgracefully
behind
time
and
he
ought
to
have
put
in
to
the
isle
of
france
which
would
have
retarded
him
his
rope
bulwarks
were
lubberly
his
rudder
a
disgrace
to
navigation
he
robarts
was
not
so
green
as
to
believe
that
any
master
had
really
sailed
sixteen
hundred
miles
with
it
and
if
he
had
more
shame
for
him
briefly
a
marine
criticaster
all
this
was
spoken
dodd
a
thing
no
male
does
unless
he
is
an
awful
snob
and
grieved
him
it
was
so
unjust
he
withdrew
wounded
to
the
little
cabin
he
was
entitled
to
as
a
passenger
and
hugged
his
treasure
for
comfort
he
patted
the
and
said
to
it
never
mind
the
greater
tartar
he
is
the
less
likely
to
sink
you
or
run
you
on
a
lee
with
all
his
love
of
discipline
robarts
was
not
so
fond
of
the
ship
as
dodd
while
his
repairs
were
going
on
he
was
generally
ashore
and
by
this
means
missed
a
visit
commodore
collier
one
of
the
smartest
sailors
afloat
espied
the
yankee
makeshift
from
the
of
his
vessel
the
fifty
guns
in
ten
minutes
he
was
under
the
stern
inspecting
it
then
came
on
board
and
was
received
in
form
by
sharpe
and
the
other
officers
are
you
the
master
of
this
ship
sir
he
asked
no
commodore
i
am
the
first
mate
the
captain
is
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
want
to
talk
about
his
oh
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
replied
sharpe
eagerly
that
was
our
dear
old
captain
he
is
on
board
young
gentleman
ask
captain
dodd
to
oblige
me
by
coming
on
deck
hy
and
fullalove
young
gentleman
inquired
collier
what
the
devil
officer
is
that
that
is
a
name
we
give
the
middies
i
do
know
nor
i
neither
ha
ha
dodd
and
fullalove
came
on
deck
and
commodore
collier
bestowed
the
highest
compliments
on
the
dodd
begged
him
to
transfer
them
to
the
real
inventor
and
introduced
fullalove
ay
said
collier
i
know
you
yankees
are
very
handy
i
lost
my
rudder
at
sea
once
and
had
to
ship
a
makeshift
but
it
was
a
cursed
complicated
thing
not
a
patch
upon
yours
fullalove
yours
is
ingenious
and
ship
has
been
in
action
i
see
pray
how
was
that
if
i
may
be
so
bold
pirates
commodore
said
sharpe
we
fell
in
with
a
brace
of
portuguese
devils
and
carrying
ten
guns
apiece
in
the
straits
of
gaspar
fought
from
noon
till
sundown
riddled
one
and
ran
down
the
other
and
sunk
her
in
a
moment
that
was
all
your
doing
captain
so
do
try
to
shift
it
on
other
people
for
we
wo
stand
if
he
denies
it
i
wo
believe
him
said
collier
for
he
has
got
it
in
his
eye
gentlemen
will
you
do
me
the
honour
to
dine
with
me
on
board
the
dodd
and
fullalove
accepted
sharpe
declined
with
regret
on
the
score
of
duty
and
as
the
cocked
hat
went
down
the
side
after
saluting
him
politely
he
could
not
help
thinking
to
himself
what
a
difference
between
a
real
captain
who
had
something
to
be
proud
of
and
his
own
unlicked
cub
of
a
skipper
with
the
manners
of
a
he
told
robarts
the
next
day
robarts
said
nothing
but
his
face
seemed
to
turn
greenish
and
it
embittered
his
hatred
of
dodd
the
inoffensive
it
is
droll
and
sad
but
true
that
christendom
is
full
of
men
in
a
hurry
to
hate
and
a
fruitful
cause
is
jealousy
the
schoolmen
or
rather
certain
of
the
schoolmen
for
nothing
is
much
shallower
than
to
speak
of
all
those
disputants
as
one
school
defined
woman
a
featherless
biped
vehemently
addicted
to
whether
she
is
more
featherless
than
the
male
can
be
decided
at
a
trifling
expense
of
time
money
and
reason
you
have
but
to
go
to
court
but
as
for
envy
and
jealousy
i
think
it
is
pure
unobservant
antique
cant
which
has
fixed
them
on
the
female
character
distinctively
as
a
molehill
to
a
mountain
is
women
jealousy
to
men
agatha
may
have
a
host
of
virtues
and
graces
and
yet
her
female
acquaintance
will
not
hate
her
provided
she
has
the
moderation
to
abstain
from
being
downright
pretty
she
may
sing
like
an
angel
paint
like
an
angel
talk
write
nurse
the
sick
all
like
an
angel
and
not
rouse
the
devil
in
her
fair
sisters
so
long
as
she
does
not
dress
like
an
angel
but
the
minds
of
men
being
much
larger
than
women
yet
very
little
greater
they
hang
jealousy
on
a
thousand
pegs
where
there
was
no
peg
i
have
seen
them
do
with
a
pin
captain
robarts
took
a
pin
ran
it
into
his
own
heart
and
hung
that
sordid
passion
on
it
he
would
get
rid
of
all
the
doddites
before
he
sailed
he
insulted
tickell
so
that
he
left
the
service
and
entered
a
mercantile
house
ashore
he
made
several
of
the
best
men
desert
and
the
ship
went
to
sea
short
of
hands
this
threw
heavier
work
on
the
crew
and
led
to
many
punishments
and
a
steady
current
of
abuse
sharpe
became
a
mere
machine
always
obeying
never
speaking
grey
was
put
under
arrest
for
remonstrating
against
ungentlemanly
language
and
bayliss
being
at
bottom
of
the
same
breed
as
robarts
fell
into
his
humour
and
helped
hector
the
petty
officers
and
men
the
crew
depressed
and
irritated
went
through
their
duties
there
was
no
song
under
the
forecastle
in
the
first
watch
and
often
no
grog
on
the
mess
table
at
one
bell
dodd
never
came
on
the
without
being
reminded
he
was
only
a
passenger
and
the
ship
was
now
under
naval
discipline
was
reared
in
the
royal
navy
sir
would
robarts
say
second
lieutenant
aboard
the
that
is
the
school
sir
that
is
the
only
school
that
breeds
dodd
bore
scores
of
similar
taunts
as
a
newfoundland
puts
up
with
a
terrier
in
office
he
seldom
replied
and
when
he
did
in
a
few
quiet
dignified
words
that
gave
no
handle
robarts
who
bore
the
name
of
a
lucky
captain
had
fair
weather
all
the
way
to
helena
the
at
this
island
was
the
she
had
left
the
cape
a
week
before
the
captain
robarts
with
his
characteristic
went
to
anchor
of
her
majesty
ship
the
wind
failed
at
a
critical
moment
and
a
foul
became
inevitable
collier
was
on
his
and
saw
what
would
happen
long
before
robarts
did
he
gave
the
needful
orders
and
it
was
beautiful
to
see
how
in
half
a
minute
the
frigate
guns
were
run
in
her
ports
lowered
her
yards
toppled
on
end
and
a
spring
carried
out
and
hauled
on
the
struck
abreast
her
own
forechains
on
the
quarter
pipe
boarders
away
tomahawks
cut
everything
that
holds
was
heard
from
the
frigate
rush
came
a
boarding
party
on
to
the
merchant
ship
and
hacked
away
without
mercy
all
her
lower
rigging
that
held
on
to
the
frigate
signal
halyards
and
all
others
boomed
her
off
with
capstan
bars
and
in
two
minutes
the
ships
were
clear
a
lieutenant
and
boat
crew
came
for
robarts
and
ordered
him
on
board
the
and
to
make
sure
of
his
coming
took
him
back
with
them
he
found
commodore
collier
standing
stiff
as
a
ramrod
on
his
are
you
the
master
of
the
his
quick
eye
had
recognised
her
in
a
moment
i
am
then
she
was
commanded
by
a
seaman
and
is
now
commanded
by
a
lubber
do
apply
for
your
papers
this
week
for
you
wo
get
them
good
morning
take
him
they
returned
robarts
to
his
ship
and
a
suppressed
grin
on
a
score
of
faces
showed
him
the
clear
commanding
tones
of
the
commodore
had
reached
his
own
deck
he
soothed
himself
by
stopping
the
men
grog
and
three
midshipmen
that
same
afternoon
the
night
before
he
weighed
anchor
this
disciplinarian
was
drinking
very
late
in
a
low
there
was
not
much
moon
and
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
ship
did
not

the

coming
till
it
was
nearly
alongside

all
was
done
in
a
flurry
hy

the

lanterns
there
jump
you
boys
or
you
catch
the
boys
did
jump
and
little
murphy
not
knowing
the
surgeon
had
ordered
the
ports
to
be
drooped
bounded
over
the
bulwarks
like
an
antelope
lighted
on
the
midship
port
which
stood
at
this
angle
and
glanced
off
into
the
ocean
lantern
foremost
he
made
his
little
hole
in
the
water
within
a
yard
of
captain
robarts
that
dignity
though
splashed
took
no
notice
of
so
small
an
incident
as
a
gone
and
if
murphy
had
been
wise
and
stayed
with
nep
all
had
been
well
but
the
poor
urchin
inadvertently
came
up
again
and
without
the
lantern
one
of
the
gig
crew
grabbed
him
by
the
hair
and
prolonged
his
existence
by
an
inconsiderate
impulse
where
is
the
other
lantern
was
robarts
first
word
on
reaching
the
deck
as
if
he
did
know
gone
overboard
sir
with
the
boy
stand
forward
you
sir
growled
robarts
murphy
stood
forward
dripping
and
shivering
with
cold
and
fear
what
d
mean
by
going
overboard
with
the
ship
lantern
och
your
arnr
sure
some
unasy
divil
drooped
the
port
and
the
lantern
and
me
we
had
no
foothold
at
all
at
all
and
the
lantern
went
into
the
say
bad
luck
to
ut
and
i
went
afther
to
try
and
save
ut
for
your
belay
all
that
said
robarts
do
you
think
you
can
blarney
me
you
young
monkey
here
bosen
mate
take
a
and
start
him
again
warm
him
well
that
as
soon
as
the
poor
child
shrieks
subsided
into
sobs
the
disciplinarian
gave
him
explanation
for
ointment
i
ca
have
the
company
stores
expended
this
the
force
of
discipline
could
no
farther
go
than
to
flog
zeal
for
falling
overboard
so
to
avoid
anticlimax
in
that
port
robarts
weighed
anchor
at
daybreak
and
there
was
a
southwesterly
breeze
waiting
for
this
favourite
of
fortune
and
carried
him
past
the
azores
off
ushant
it
was
westerly
and
veered
to
the
just
before
they
sighted
the
land
end
never
was
such
a
charming
passage
from
the
cape
the
sailor
who
had
the
luck
to
sight
old
england
first
nailed
his
starboard
shoe
to
the
mainmast
for
contributions
and
all
hearts
beat
joyfully
none
more
than
david
dodd
his
eye
devoured
the
beloved
shore
he
hugged
the
treasure
his
own
ill
luck
had
jeopardised
but
robarts
had
sailed
it
safe
into
british
waters
and
forgave
the
man
his
ill
manners
for
his
good
luck
robarts
steered
in
for
the
lizard
but
when
abreast
the
point
kept
well
out
again
and
opened
the
channel
and
looked
out
for
a
pilot
one
was
soon
seen
working
out
towards
him
and
the
brought
to
the
pilot
descended
from
his
lugger
into
his
little
boat
rowed
alongside
and
came
on
deck
a
rough
tanned
sailor
clad
in
flushing
and
in
build
and
manner
might
have
passed
for
robarts
twin
brother
now
then
you
sir
what
will
you
take
this
ship
up
to
the
downs
for
thirty
roberts
told
him
roughly
he
would
not
get
thirty
pounds
out
of
thyse
and
no
higher
my
bo
answered
the
pilot
sturdily
he
had
been
splicing
the
main
brace
and
would
have
answered
an
admiral
robarts
swore
at
him
lustily
pilot
discharged
a
volley
in
return
with
admirable
promptitude
robarts
retorted
the
other
rough
customer
rejoined
and
soon
all
billingsgate
thundered
on
the
finding
to
his
infinite
disgust
his
visitor
as
great
a
blackguard
as
himself
and
not
to
be
outsworn
robarts
ordered
him
to
quit
the
ship
on
pain
of
being
over
the
side
oh
that
it
is
it
growled
the
other
here
fill
and
be
off
he
prudently
bottled
the
rest
of
his
rage
till
he
got
safe
into
his
boat
then
shook
his
fist
at
the
and
cursed
her
captain
you
see
the
fair
wind
but
you
do
see
the
channel
fret
ye
greedy
gander
downs
you
never
see
them
you
have
saved
your
money
and
lost
your
ship
ye
robarts
hurled
back
a
or
two
of
the
same
and
then
ordered
bayliss
to
clap
on
all
sail
and
keep
a
course
through
the
night
at
four
bells
in
the
middle
watch
sharpe
in
charge
of
the
ship
tapped
at
robarts
door
blowing
hard
sir
and
the
weather
getting
wind
fair
still
yes
then
call
me
if
it
blows
any
harder
grunted
robarts
in
two
hours
more
tap
tap
came
bayliss
in
charge
if
we
do
take
sail
in
they
take
themselves
furl
and
call
me
if
it
gets
any
in
another
hour
bayliss
was
at
him
again
blowing
a
gale
sir
and
a
channel
fog
reef
taupsles
and
call
me
if
it
gets
any
at
daybreak
dodd
was
on
deck
and
found
the
ship
flying
through
a
fog
so
thick
that
her
forecastle
was
quite
invisible
from
the
poop
and
even
her
foremast
loomed
indistinct
and
looked
distant
you
be
foul
of
something
or
other
sharpe
said
he
what
is
that
to
you
inquired
a
loud
rough
voice
behind
him
i
allow
passengers
to
handle
my
then
do
pray
handle
her
yourself
captain
is
this
weather
to
go
tearing
up
the
channel
i
mean
to
sail
her
without
your
advice
sir
and
being
a
seaman
i
shall
get
all
i
can
out
of
a
fair
that
is
right
captain
robarts
if
you
had
but
the
british
channel
all
to
perhaps
you
will
leave
me
my
deck
all
to
i
should
be
delighted
but
my
anxiety
will
not
let
with
this
dodd
retired
a
few
steps
and
kept
a
keen
at
noon
a
lusty
voice
cried
land
on
the
weather
beam
all
eyes
were
turned
that
way
and
saw
nothing
land
in
sight
was
reported
to
captain
robarts
now
that
worthy
was
in
reality
getting
secretly
anxious
so
he
ran
on
deck
crying
who
saw
it
captain
dodd
ugh
nobody
else
dodd
came
forward
and
with
a
respectful
air
told
him
that
being
on
the
he
had
seen
the
coast
of
the
isle
of
wight
in
a
momentary
lift
of
the
haze
isle
of
fiddlestick
was
the
polite
reply
isle
of
wight
is
eighty
miles
astern
by
dodd
answered
firmly
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
every
outline
in
the
channel
and
that
the
land
he
had
seen
was
katherine
point
robarts
deigned
no
reply
but
had
the
log
heaved
it
showed
the
vessel
to
be
running
twelve
knots
an
hour
he
then
went
to
his
cabin
and
consulted
his
chart
and
having
worked
his
problem
came
hastily
on
deck
and
went
from
rashness
to
wonderful
caution
turn
the
hands
out
and
heave
the
ship
to
the
manoeuvre
was
executed
gradually
and
ably
and
scarce
a
bucketful
of
water
shipped
furl
taupsles
and
set
the
main
trysail
there
dodd
so
much
for
you
and
your
isle
of
wight
the
land
you
saw
was
dungeness
and
would
have
run
on
into
the
north
sea
i
be
when
a
man
habitually
calm
turns
anxious
he
becomes
more
irritable
and
the
mixture
of
timidity
and
rashness
he
saw
in
robarts
made
dodd
very
anxious
he
replied
angrily
at
all
events
i
should
not
make
a
foul
wind
out
of
a
fair
one
by
heaving
to
and
if
i
did
i
would
heave
to
on
the
right
at
this
sudden
facer
one
too
from
a
patient
man
robarts
staggered
a
moment
he
recovered
and
with
an
oath
ordered
dodd
to
go
below
or
he
would
have
him
chucked
into
the
hold
come
do
be
an
ass
robarts
said
dodd
contemptuously
then
lowering
his
voice
to
a
whisper
do
you
know
the
men
only
want
such
an
order
as
that
to
chuck
you
into
the
sea
robarts
trembled
oh
if
you
mean
to
head
a
mutiny
heaven
forbid
sir
but
i
wo
leave
the
deck
in
dirty
weather
like
this
till
the
captain
knows
where
he
towards
sunset
it
got
clearer
and
they
drifted
past
a
revenue
cutter
who
was
lying
to
with
her
head
to
the
northward
she
hoisted
no
end
of
signals
but
they
understood
none
of
them
and
her
captain
gesticulated
wildly
on
her
deck
what
is
that
fantoccio
dancing
at
inquired
captain
robarts
brutally
to
see
a
ship
drift
to
leeward
in
a
narrow
sea
with
a
fair
wind
said
dodd
bitterly
at
night
it
blew
hard
and
the
sea
ran
high
and
irregular
the
ship
began
to
be
uneasy
and
robarts
very
properly
ordered
the
and
royal
yards
to
be
sent
down
on
deck
dodd
would
have
had
them
down
twelve
hours
ago
the
mate
gave
the
order
no
one
moved
the
mate
went
forward
angry
he
came
back
pale
the
men
refused
to
go
aloft
they
would
not
risk
their
lives
for
captain
robarts
the
officers
all
assembled
and
went
forward
they
promised
and
threatened
but
all
in
vain
the
crew
stood
sullen
together
as
if
to
back
one
another
and
put
forward
a
spokesman
to
say
that
there
was
not
one
of
them
the
captain
had
started
and
stopped
his
grog
a
dozen
times
he
had
made
the
ship
hell
to
them
and
now
her
masts
and
yards
and
hull
might
go
there
along
with
her
skipper
for
robarts
received
this
tidings
in
sullen
silence
do
tell
that
dodd
whatever
you
do
said
he
they
will
come
round
now
they
have
had
their
growl
they
are
too
near
home
to
shy
away
their
robarts
had
not
sufficient
insight
into
character
to
know
that
dodd
would
instantly
have
sided
with
him
against
a
mutiny
but
at
this
juncture
the
of
the
was
down
in
the
cabin
with
his
preparing
a
general
remonstrance
he
had
a
chart
before
him
and
a
pair
of
compasses
in
his
hand
st
katherine
point
lay
about
eight
miles
to
windward
at
noon
and
we
have
been
drifting
south
and
east
this
twelve
hours
through
lying
to
on
the
starboard
tack
and
besides
the
ship
has
been
conned
as
slovenly
as
she
is
sailed
i
seen
her
allowed
to
break
off
a
dozen
times
and
gather
more
leeway
ah
here
is
captain
robarts
captain
you
saw
the
rate
we
passed
the
revenue
cutter
that
vessel
was
nearly
stationary
so
what
we
passed
her
at
was
our
own
rate
of
drifting
and
our
least
rate
putting
all
this
together
we
ca
be
many
miles
from
the
french
coast
and
unless
we
look
sharp
and
beat
to
windward
i
pronounce
the
ship
in
a
horselaugh
greeted
this
conclusion
we
are
nearer
yarmouth
sands
than
france
i
promise
you
and
nothing
under
our
lee
nearer
than
a
loud
cry
from
the
deck
above
a
light
on
the
lee
bow
there
cried
robarts
with
an
oath
foul
of
next
through
me
listening
to
your
he
ran
upon
deck
and
shouted
through
his
trumpet
all
hands
wear
ship
the
crew
who
had
heard
the
previous
cry
obeyed
orders
in
the
presence
of
an
immediate
danger
and
perhaps
their
growl
had
really
relieved
their
robarts
with
delight
saw
them
come
tumbling
up
and
gave
his
orders
lustily
brail
up
the
trysel
up
with
the
helm
in
with
the
weather
main
brace
square
the
after
yards
the
ship
bow
turned
from
the
wind
and
as
soon
as
she
got
way
on
her
robarts
ran
below
again
and
entered
the
cabin
triumphant
that
is
all
right
and
now
captain
dodd
a
word
with
you
you
will
either
retire
at
once
to
your
cabin
or
will
cease
to
breed
disaffection
in
my
crew
and
groundless
alarm
in
my
passengers
by
instilling
your
own
childish
ignorant
fears
the
ship
has
been
underlogged
a
hundred
miles
sir
and
but
for
my
caution
in
lying
to
for
clear
weather
we
should
be
groping
among
the
fern
isl
crash
an
shock
threw
the
speaker
and
all
the
rest
in
a
mass
on
the
floor
smashed
every
lamp
put
out
every
light
and
with
a
fierce
grating
noise
the
ship
was
hard
and
fast
on
the
french
coast
with
her
stern
to
the
sea
one
awful
moment
of
silence
then
amidst
shrieks
of
agony
the
sea
struck
her
like
a
rolling
rock
solid
to
crush
liquid
to
drown
and
the
comb
of
a
wave
smashed
the
cabin
windows
and
rushed
in
among
them
as
they
floundered
on
the
floor
and
wetted
and
chilled
them
to
the
marrow
a
voice
in
the
dark
cried
o
god
we
are
dead
chapter
xiv
on
deck
for
your
lives
cried
dodd
forgetting
in
that
awful
moment
he
was
not
the
captain
and
drove
them
all
up
robarts
included
and
caught
hold
of
beresford
and
freddy
at
their
cabin
door
and
half
carried
them
with
him
just
as
they
got
on
deck
the
third
wave
a
high
one
struck
the
ship
and
lifted
her
bodily
up
canted
her
round
and
dashed
her
down
again
some
yards
to
leeward
throwing
them
down
on
the
hard
and
streaming
deck
at
this
tremendous
shock
the
ship
seemed
a
live
thing
shrieking
and
wailing
as
well
as
quivering
with
the
blow
but
one
voice
dissented
loudly
from
the
general
dismay
all
right
men
cried
dodd
firm
and
she
is
broadside
on
now
captain
robarts
look
alive
sir
speak
to
the
men
do
go
to
sleep
robarts
was
in
a
lethargy
of
fear
at
this
appeal
he
started
into
a
fury
of
ephemeral
courage
stick
to
the
ship
he
yelled
there
is
no
danger
if
you
stick
to
the
ship
and
with
this
snatched
a
and
hurled
himself
into
the
sea
dodd
caught
up
the
trumpet
that
fell
from
his
hand
and
roared
i
command
this
ship
officers
come
round
me
men
to
your
quarters
come
bear
a
hand
here
and
fire
a
gun
that
will
show
us
where
we
are
and
let
the
frenchmen
the
carronade
was
fired
and
its
momentary
flash
revealed
that
the
ship
was
ashore
in
a
little
bay
the
land
abeam
was
low
and
some
eighty
yards
off
but
there
was
something
black
and
rugged
nearer
the
ship
stern
their
situation
was
awful
to
windward
huge
black
waves
rose
like
tremendous
ruins
and
came
rolling
fringed
with
devouring
fire
and
each
wave
as
it
charged
them
curled
up
to
an
incredible
height
and
dashed
down
on
the
doomed
ship
solid
to
crush
liquid
to
drown
with
a
ponderous
stroke
that
made
the
poor
souls
stagger
and
sent
a
sheet
of
water
so
clean
over
her
that
part
fell
to
leeward
and
only
part
came
down
on
deck
foretaste
of
a
watery
death
and
each
of
these
fearful
blows
drove
the
groaning
trembling
vessel
farther
on
the
sand
bumping
her
along
as
if
she
had
been
but
a
skiff
now
it
was
men
showed
their
inner
selves
seeing
death
so
near
on
one
hand
and
a
chance
of
escape
on
the
other
seven
men
proved
unable
to
resist
the
two
great
passions
of
fear
and
hope
on
a
scale
so
gigantic
and
side
by
side
bayliss
a
midshipman
and
five
sailors
stole
the
only
available
boat
and
lowered
her
she
was
swamped
in
a
moment
many
of
the
crew
got
to
the
rum
and
stupefied
themselves
to
their
destruction
others
rallied
round
their
old
captain
and
recovered
their
native
courage
at
the
brave
and
hopeful
bearing
he
wore
over
a
heart
full
of
anguish
he
worked
like
a

loaded
a
carronade
with
a
pound
of
powder
and
a
coil
of
rope
with
an
iron
bar
attached
to
a
cable
and
shot
the
rope
and

fired
from

whose

had
taken
for

no

any
nearer
on

minute
to

asked

to

line

is
enough
on
such
a
desperate
errand
said
dodd
with
a
groan
but
now
emulation
was
up
and
neither
briton
yankee
nor
negro
would
give
way
a
line
was
made
fast
to
the
sailor
waist
and
he
was
lowered
to
leeward
his
venturesome
rivals
followed
the
sea
swallowed
those
three
heroes
like
crumbs
and
small
was
the
hope
of
life
for
them
the
three
heroes
being
swimmers
and
divers
and
going
with
the
tide
soon
neared
the
shore
on
the
ship
lee
quarter
but
a
sight
of
it
was
enough
to
attempt
to
land
on
that
rock
with
such
a
sea
on
was
to
get
their
skulls
smashed
like
eggshells
in
a
moment
they
had
to
coast
it
looking
out
for
a
soft
place
they
found
one
and
tried
to
land
but
so
irresistible
was
the
suction
of
the
retiring
wave
that
whenever
they
got
foot
on
the
sand
and
tried
to
run
they
were
wrenched
out
to
sea
again
and
pounded
black
and
blue
and
breathless
by
the
curling
breaker
they
met
coming
in
after
a
score
of
vain
efforts
the
negro
throwing
himself
on
his
back
went
in
with
a
high
wave
and
on
touching
the
sand
turned
dug
all
his
ten
claws
into
it
clenched
his
teeth
and
scrambled
like
a
cat
at
a
wall
having
more
power
in
his
toes
than
the
europeans
and
luckily
getting
one
hand
on
a
firm
stone
his
prodigious
strength
just
enabled
him
to
stick
first
while
the
wave
went
back
and
then
seizing
the
moment
he
tore
himself
ashore
but
bleeding
and
bruised
all
over
and
with
a
tooth
actually
broken
by
clenching
in
the
convulsive
struggle
he
found
some
natives
dancing
about
in
violent
agitation
with
a
rope
but
afraid
to
go
in
and
help
him
and
no
wonder
not
being
seagulls
by
the
light
of
their
lanterns
he
saw
fullalove
washing
in
and
out
like
a
log
he
seized
one
end
of
the
rope
and
dashed
in
and
grabbed
his
friend
and
they
were
hauled
ashore
together
both
breathless
and
fullalove
speechless
the
negro
looked
round
for
the
sailor
but
could
not
see
him
soon
however
there
was
a
cry
from
some
more
natives
about
fifty
yards
off
and
laterns
held
up
away
he
dashed
with
the
rope
just
in
time
to
see
jack
make
a
last
gallant
attempt
to
land
it
ended
in
his
being
flung
up
like
a
straw
into
the
air
on
the
very
crest
of
a
wave
fifteen
feet
high
and
out
to
sea
with
his
arms
whirling
and
a
death
shriek
which
was
echoed
by
every
woman
within
hearing
in
dashed
vespasian
with
the
rope
and
gripped
the
drowning
man
long
hair
with
his
teeth
then
jerked
the
rope
and
they
were
both
pulled
ashore
with
infinite
difficulty
the
frenchmen
gave
them
all
three
lots
of
and
brandy
and
pats
on
the
back
and
carried
the
line
for
them
to
a
flagstaff
on
the
rocks
nearer
the
stern
of
the
ship
the
ship
began
to
show
the
first
signs
of
breaking
up
hammered
to
death
by
the
sea
she
discharged
the
oakum
from
her
opening
seams
and
her
decks
began
to
gape
and
grin
fore
and
aft
corpses
of
drunken
sailors
drowned
between
decks
now
floated
up
amidships
and
washed
and
rolled
about
among
the
survivors
feet
these
seeing
no
hope
went
about
making
up
all
quarrels
and
shaking
hands
in
token
of
a
christian
end
one
or
two
came
to
dodd
with
their
hands
out
avast
ye
lubbers
said
he
angrily
do
you
think
i
have
time
for
nonsense
foksel
ahoy
axes
and
cut
the
weather
shrouds
it
was
done
the
foremast
went
by
the
board
directly
and
fell
to
leeward
a
few
blows
of
the
axe
from
dodd
own
hand
sent
the
mainmast
after
it
the
rose
a
streak
and
the
next
wave
carried
her
a
little
farther
on
shore
and
now
the
man
in
charge
of
the
hawser
reported
with
joy
that
there
was
a
strain
on
it
this
gave
those
on
board
a
hope
of
life
dodd
bustled
and
had
the
hawser
carefully
payed
out
by
two
men
while
he
himself
secured
the
other
end
in
the
mizen
top
he
had
left
that
mast
standing
on
purpose
there
was
no
fog
here
but
great
heavy
black
clouds
flying
about
with
amazing
swiftness
extinguished
the
moon
at
intervals
at
others
she
glimmered
through
a
dull
mist
in
which
she
was
veiled
and
gave
the
poor
souls
on
the
a
dim
peep
of
the
frail
and
narrow
bridge
they
must
pass
to
live
a
thing
like
a
black
snake
went
down
from
the
bellying
towards
the
yawning
sea
and
soon
lost
to
sight
it
was
seen
rising
again
among
some
lanterns
on
the
rock
ashore
but
what
became
of
it
in
the
middle
the
darkness
seemed
to
cut
it
in
two
the
sea
to
swallow
it
yet
to
get
from
a
ship
going
to
pieces
under
them
the
sailors
precipitated
themselves
eagerly
on
that
black
thread
bellying
to
the
sea
and
flickering
in
the
wind
they
went
down
it
one
after
another
and
anxious
eyes
straining
after
them
saw
them
no
more
but
this
was
seen
that
scarce
one
in
three
emerged
into
the
lights
ashore
then
dodd
got
an
axe
and
stood
in
the
top
and
threatened
to
brain
the
first
man
who
attempted
to
go
on
the
rope
we
must
make
it
taut
first
said
he
bear
a
hand
here
with
a
even
while
this
was
being
done
the
other
rope
whose
end
he
had
fired
ashore
was
seen
moving
to
windward
the
natives
it
seems
had
found
it
half
buried
in
sand
dodd
unlashed
the
end
from
the
bulwarks
and
carried
it
into
the
top
and
made
it
fast
and
soon
there
were
two
black
snakes
dipping
shrorewards
and
waving
in
the
air
side
by
side
the
sailors
scrambled
for
a
place
and
some
of
them
were
lost
by
their
own
rashness
kenealy
waited
coolly
and
went
by
himself
finally
dodd
was
left
in
the
ship
with
sharpe
and
the
women
and
little
murphy
and
ramgolam
whom
robarts
had
liberated
to
show
his
contempt
of
dodd
he
now
advised
beresford
to
be
lashed
to
sharpe
and
himself
and
venture
the
passage
but
she
screamed
and
clung
to
him
and
said
i
dare
not
oh
i
dare
not
then
i
must
lash
you
to
a
spar
said
he
for
she
ca
last
much
he
ordered
sharpe
ashore
sharpe
shook
hands
with
him
and
went
on
the
rope
with
tears
in
his
eyes
dodd
went
hard
to
work
lashed
beresford
to
a
piece
of
broken
filled
fred
pockets
with
corks
and
sewed
them
up
you
never
caught
dodd
without
a
needle
only
unlike
the
women
it
was
always
kept
threaded
beresford
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
wildly
a
way
women
have
in
mortal
peril
it
is
but
their
homage
to
courage
all
right
said
dodd
interpreting
it
as
appeal
to
his
protection
and
affecting
cheerfulness
we
get
ashore
together
on
the
poop
awning
or
somehow
never
you
fear
i
give
a
thousand
pounds
to
know
where
high
water
at
this
moment
with
a
report
like
a
cannon
the
lower
decks
burst
fore
and
aft
another
still
louder
and
the
back
broke
she
parted
amidships
with
a
fearful
yawn
and
the
waves
went
toppling
and
curling
clean
through
her
at
this
appalling
sound
and
sight
the
few
creatures
left
on
the
poop
cowered
screaming
and
clinging
at
dodd
knees
and
fought
for
a
bit
of
him
yes
as
a
flood
brings
incongruous
animals
together
on
some
little
isle
in
brotherhood
of
fear
creatures
who
never
met
before
without
one
eating
the
other
and
there
they
cuddle
so
the
thief
ramgolam
clung
to
the
man
he
had
tried
to
rob
the
hindoo
ayan
and
the
english
maid
hustled
their
mistress
the
haughty
beresford
and
were
hustled
by
her
for
a
bit
of
this
human
pillar
and
little
murphy
and
fred
beresford
wriggled
in
at
him
where
they
could
and
the
poor
goat
crept
into
the
quivering
mass
trembling
like
an
aspen
and
not
a
butt
left
either
in
his
head
or
his
heart
dodd
stood
in
the
middle
of
these
tremblers
a
rock
of
manhood
and
when
he
was
silent
and
they
heard
only
the
voice
of
the
waves
they
despaired
and
whenever
he
spoke
they
started
at
the
astounding
calmness
of
his
voice
and
words
and
life
sounded
possible
come
said
he
this
wo
do
any
longer
all
hands
into
the
he
helped
them
all
up
and
stood
on
the
ratlines
himself
and
if
you
will
believe
me
the
poor
goat
wailed
like
a
child
below
he
found
in
that
new
terror
and
anguish
a
voice
goat
was
never
heard
to
speak
in
before
but
they
had
to
leave
him
on
deck
no
help
for
it
dodd
advised
beresford
once
more
to
attempt
the
rope
she
declined
i
dare
not
i
dare
not
she
cried
but
she
begged
dodd
hard
to
go
on
it
and
save
himself
it
was
a
strong
temptation
he
clutched
the
treasure
in
his
bosom
and
one
sob
burst
from
the
strong
man
that
sob
was
but
the
tax
paid
by
nature
for
pride
humanity
and
manhood
stood
staunch
in
spite
of
it
no
no
i
ca
said
he
i
must
do
tempt
me
to
leave
you
in
this
plight
and
be
a
cur
live
or
die
i
must
be
the
last
man
on
her
here
something
coming
out
to
us
the
lord
in
heaven
be
praised
a
bright
light
was
seen
moving
down
the
black
line
that
held
them
to
the
shore
it
descended
slowly
within
a
foot
of
the
billows
and
lighting
them
up
showed
their
fearful
proximity
to
the
rope
in
they
had
washed
off
many
a
poor
fellow
at
that
part
look
at
that
thank
heaven
you
did
not
try
it
said
dodd
to
beresford
at
tins
moment
a
higher
wave
than
usual
swallowed
up
the
light
there
was
a
loud
cry
of
dismay
from
the
shore
and
a
wail
of
despair
from
the
ship
no
not
lost
after
all
the
light
emerged
and
mounted
and
mounted
towards
the
ship
it
came
near
and
showed
the
black
shiny
body
of
vespasian
with
very
little
on
but
a
handkerchief
and
a
lantern
the
former
round
his
waist
and
the
latter
lashed
to
his
back
he
arrived
with
a
yah
yah
and
showed
his
white
teeth
in
a
grin
beresford
clutched
his
shoulder
and
whimpered
oh
black
iss
missy
dis
child
bring
good
news
massah
fullalove
send
you
his
congratulations
and
the
compliments
of
the
season
and
take
the
liberty
to
observe
the
tide
am
turn
in
twenty
the
good
news
thus
quaintly
announced
caused
an
outburst
of
joy
from
dodd
and
he
insisted
on
all
hands
joining
in
a
cheer
the
shore
it
directly
and
this
encouraged
the
forlorn
band
still
more
to
hear
other
hearts
beating
for
them
so
near
even
the
intervening
waves
could
not
quite
annul
the
sustaining
power
of
sympathy
at
this
moment
came
the
first
faint
streaks
of
welcome
dawn
and
revealed
their
situation
more
fully
the
vessel
lay
on
the
edge
of
a
sandbank
she
was
clean
in
two
the
stern
lying
somewhat
higher
than
the
stem
the
sea
rolled
through
her
amidships
six
feet
broad
frightful
to
look
at
and
made
a
clean
breach
over
her
forward
all
except
the
bowsprit
to
the
end
of
which
the
poor
sailors
were
now
discovered
to
be
clinging
the
afterpart
of
the
poop
was
out
of
water
and
in
a
corner
of
it
the
goat
crouched
like
a
rabbit
four
dead
bodies
washed
about
beneath
the
party
trembling
in
the
and
one
had
got
jammed
in
the
wheel
face
uppermost
and
glared
up
at
them
gazing
down
no
sign
of
the
tide
turning
yet
and
much
reason
to
fear
it
would
turn
too
late
for
them
and
the
poor
fellows
shivering
on
the
bowsprit
these
fears
were
well
founded
a
huge
sea
rolled
in
and
turned
the
forepart
of
the
vessel
half
over
buried
the
bowsprit
and
washed
the
men
off
into
the
breakers
beresford
sank
down
and
prayed
holding
vespasian
by
the
knee
fortunately
as
in
that
vessel
wrecked
long
syne
on
melita
the
hind
part
of
the
ship
stuck
fast
and
remained
but
for
how
long
each
wave
now
struck
the
ship
weather
quarter
with
a
sound
like
a
cannon
fired
in
a
church
and
sent
the
water
clear
into
the
it
hit
them
like
strokes
of
a
whip
they
were
drenched
to
the
skin
chilled
to
the
bone
and
frozen
to
the
heart
with
fear
they
made
acquaintance
that
hour
with
death
ay
death
itself
has
no
bitterness
that
forlorn
cluster
did
not
feel
only
the
insensibility
that
ends
that
bitterness
was
wanting
now
the
sea
you
must
know
was
literally
strewed
with
things
out
of
the
masts
rigging
furniture
bundles
of
canes
chairs
tables
but
of
all
this
jetsam
dodd
eye
had
been
for
some
little
time
fixed
on
one
object
a
live
sailor
drifting
ashore
on
a
great
wooden
case
it
struck
him
after
a
while
that
the
man
made
very
little
way
and
at
last
seemed
to
go
up
and
down
in
one
place
he
saw
him
nearer
and
nearer
and
recognised
him
it
was
one
of
the
three
washed
off
the
bowsprit
he
cried
joyfully
the
tide
has
turned
here
thompson
coming
out
to
then
there
ensued
a
dialogue
incredible
to
landsmen
between
these
two
sailors
the
captain
of
the
ship
and
the
captain
of
the
foretop
one
perched
on
a
stationary
fragment
of
that
vessel
the
other
drifting
on
a
pianoforte
and
both
bawling
at
one
another
across
the
jaws
of
death
thompson
ahoy
whither
bound
going
out
with
the
tide
and
be
d
d
to
what
ca
ye
swim
like
a
brass
it
all
over
with
poor
jack
all
over
do
tell
me
look
out
now
as
you
drift
under
our
stern
and
we
lower
you
the
lord
bless
you
sir
do
pray
cried
thompson
losing
his
recklessness
with
the
chance
of
life
by
this
time
the
shore
was
black
with
people
and
a
boat
was
brought
down
to
the
beach
but
to
attempt
to
launch
it
was
to
be
sucked
out
to
sea
at
present
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
thompson
drifting
to
destruction
dodd
cut
the
hawser
and
vespasian
on
deck
lowered
it
with
a
line
so
that
thompson
presently
drifted
right
athwart
it
all
right
sir
said
he
grasping
it
and
amidst
thundering
acclamations
was
drawn
to
land
full
of
salt
water
and
all
but
insensible
the
piano
landed
at
dunkirk
three
weeks
later
in
the
bustle
of
this
good
and
smart
action
the
tide
retired
perceptibly
the
sea
struck
lower
and
with
less
weight
at
dodd
took
his
little
party
down
on
deck
again
being
now
the
safest
place
for
the
mast
might
go
it
was
a
sad
scene
the
deck
was
now
dry
and
the
dead
bodies
lay
quiet
around
them
with
glassy
eyes
and
grotesquely
horrible
the
long
hair
of
two
or
three
was
stiff
and
crystallised
with
the
saltpetre
in
the
ship
beresford
clung
to
vespasian
she
held
his
bare
black
shoulder
with
one
white
and
jewelled
hand
and
his
wrist
with
the
other
tight
oh
black
said
she
how
brave
you
are
it
is
incredible
why
you
came
back
i
must
feel
a
brave
man
with
both
my
hands
or
i
shall
die
your
skin
is
nice
and
soft
too
i
shall
never
outlive
this
dreadful
and
now
that
the
water
was
too
low
to
wash
them
off
the
hawser
several
of
the
ship
company
came
back
to
the
ship
to
help
the
women
down
by
noon
the
deck
was
thirty
feet
from
the
sand
the
rescued
ones
wanted
to
break
their
legs
and
necks
but
dodd
would
not
permit
even
that
he
superintended
the
whole
manoeuvre
and
lowered
first
the
dead
then
the
living
not
omitting
the
poor
goat
who
was
motionless
and
limp
with
fright
when
they
were
all
safe
on
the
sand
dodd
stood
alone
upon
the
poop
a
minute
cheered
by
all
the
sailors
french
and
english
ashore
then
slid
down
a
rope
and
rejoined
his
companions
to
their
infinite
surprise
the
undaunted
one
was
found
to
be
snivelling
oh
dear
what
is
the
matter
said
beresford
tenderly
the
poor
she
was
such
a
beautiful
and
just
look
at
her
now
never
sail
again
never
never
she
was
a
little
crank
in
beating
i
ca
deny
it
but
how
she
did
fly
with
the
wind
abaft
she
sank
a
pirate
in
the
straits
and
weathered
a
hurricane
off
the
mauritius
and
after
all
for
a
lubber
to
go
and
lay
her
bones
ashore
in
a
fair
wind
poor
dear
beauty
he
maundered
thus
and
kept
turning
back
to
look
at
the
wreck
till
he
happened
to
lay
his
hand
on
his
breast
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
his
ridiculous
lament
wore
a
look
of
and
cast
his
eyes
upward
in
heartfelt
gratitude
the
companions
of
so
many
adventures
dispersed
a
hospitable
mayoress
entertained
beresford
and
suite
and
she
took
to
her
bed
for
she
fell
seriously
ill
as
soon
as
ever
she
could
do
it
with
impunity
colonel
kenealy
went
off
to
paris
i
gain
that
any
way
by
being
wrecked
said
he
if
there
be
a
lover
of
quadrupeds
here
let
him
know
that
weakness
proved
his
strength
being
brandied
by
a
french
sailor
he
winked
his
eye
being
brandied
greatly
he
staggered
up
and
butted
his
benefactor
like
a
man
fullalove
had
dry
clothes
and
a
blazing
fire
ready
for
dodd
at
a
little
rude
auberge
he
sat
over
it
and
dried
a
few
he
had
loose
about
him
and
examined
his
greater
treasure
his
children
the
was
much
stained
but
no
harm
whatever
done
to
the
contents
in
the
midst
of
this
employment
the
shadow
of
an
enormous
head
was
projected
right
upon
his
treasure
turning
with
a
start
he
saw
a
face
at
the
window
one
of
those
vile
mugs
which
are
found
to
perfection
amongst
the
of
the
french
nation
bloated
grizzly
and
like
the
ugly
thing
on
being
confronted
passed
slowly
out
of
the
sun
and
dodd
thought
no
more
of
it
the
owner
of
this
sinister
visage
was
andre
thibout
of
whom
it
might
be
said
like
face
like
life
for
he
was
one
of
those
creatures
who
feed
upon
the
misfortunes
of
their
kind
and
stand
on
shore
in
foul
weather
hoping
the
worst
instead
of
praying
for
the
best
briefly
a
wrecker
he
and
his
comrade
jacques
moinard
had
heard
the
gun
fired
and
came
down
to
batten
on
the
wreck
but
ho
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
there
were
gensdarmes
and
soldiers
lining
the
beach
and
the
bayonet
interposed
between
theft
and
misfortune
so
now
the
desperate
pair
were
prowling
about
like
hungry
baffled
wolves
curses
on
their
lips
and
rage
at
their
hearts
dodd
was
extremely
anxious
to
get
to
barkington
before
the
news
of
the
wreck
for
otherwise
he
knew
his
wife
and
children
would
suffer
a
agony
in
a
single
day
the
only
chance
he
saw
was
to
get
to
boulogne
in
time
to
catch
the
sailing
packet
for
it
was
her
day
but
then
boulogne
was
eight
leagues
distant
and
there
was
no
public
conveyance
going
fullalove
entering
heartily
into
his
feelings
was
gone
to
look
for
horses
to
hire
aided
by
the
british
consul
the
black
hero
was
upstairs
clearing
out
with
a
pin
two
holes
that
had
fallen
into
decay
for
want
of
use
these
holes
were
in
his
ears
and
now
worn
out
by
anxiety
and
hard
work
dodd
began
to
nod
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
he
had
not
been
long
asleep
when
the
hideous
face
of
thibout
reappeared
at
the
window
and
watched
him
presently
a
low
whistle
was
uttered
outside
and
soon
the
two
ruffians
entered
the
room
and
finding
the
landlady
there
as
well
as
dodd
called
for
a
little
glass
apiece
of
absinthe
while
drinking
it
they
cast
furtive
glances
towards
dodd
and
waited
till
she
should
go
about
her
business
and
leave
them
alone
with
him
but
the
good
woman
surmised
their
looks
and
knowing
the
character
of
the
men
poured
out
a
cup
of
coffee
from
a
great
metal
reservoir
by
the
fire
and
waked
dodd
without
ceremony
voici
votre
cafe
monsieur
making
believe
he
had
ordered
it
merci
madame
replied
he
for
his
wife
had
taught
him
a
little
french
one
may
sleep
a
propos
muttered
the
woman
in
his
ear
my
man
is
at
the
fair
and
there
are
people
here
who
are
not
worth
any
great
dodd
rubbed
his
eyes
and
saw
those
two
foul
faces
at
the
end
of
the
kitchen
for
such
it
was
though
called
a
humph
said
he
and
instinctively
buttoned
his
coat
at
that
thibout
touched
moinard
knee
under
the
table
fullalove
came
in
soon
after
to
say
he
had
got
two
horses
and
they
would
be
here
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
well
but
vespasian
how
is
he
to
go
inquired
dodd
oh
we
send
him
on
ahead
and
then
ride
and
no
no
said
dodd
i
go
ahead
that
will
shake
me
up
i
think
i
should
tumble
off
a
horse
i
so
dead
accordingly
he
started
to
walk
on
the
road
to
boulogne
he
had
not
been
gone
three
minutes
when
moinard
sauntered
out
moinard
had
not
been
gone
two
minutes
when
thibout
strolled
out
moinard
kept
dodd
in
sight
and
thibout
kept
moinard
the
horses
were
brought
soon
after
but
unfortunately
the
pair
did
not
start
immediately
though
had
they
known
it
every
moment
was
precious
they
wasted
time
in
argument
vespasian
had
come
down
with
a
diamond
ring
in
one
ear
and
a
ruby
in
the
other
fullalove
saw
this
retrograde
step
and
said
grimly
have
you
washed
but
half
your
face
or
is
this
a
return
to
savagery
vespasian
wore
an
air
of
offended
dignity
no
sar
these
yar
decorations
come
off
a
lady

a

he
added
he
had
put
them
in
his
ears
because
the
biggest
would
not
go
on
his
little
finger
fullalove
groaned
and
of
course
the
next
thing
you
ring
your
snout
like
a
pig
or
a
patagonian
there
come
along
ye
darn
he
was
going
to
say
cuss
but
remembering
his
pupil
late
heroic
conduct
softened
it
down
to
anomaly
but
vespasian
always
measured
the
force
of
words
by
their
length
or
obscurity
anomaly
cut
him
to
the
heart
he
rode
off
in
moody
silence
and
dejection
asking
himself
sorrowfully
what
he
had
done
that
such
a
mountain
of
vituperation
should
fall
on
him
anomaly
they
cantered
along
in
silence
for
fullalove
was
digesting
this
new
trait
in
his
pupil
and
asking
himself
could
he
train
it
out
or
must
he
cross
it
out
just
outside
the
town
they
met
captain
robarts
walking
in
he
had
landed
three
miles
off
down
the
coast
hallo
said
fullalove
i
suppose
you
thought
i
was
drowned
said
robarts
spitefully
but
you
see
i
alive
fullalove
replied
well
captain
that
is
only
one
mistake
more
made
i
about
two
english
miles
from
the
town
they
came
to
a
long
straight
slope
up
and
down
where
they
could
see
a
league
before
them
and
there
they
caught
sight
of
david
dodd
tall
figure
mounting
the
opposite
rise
behind
him
at
some
little
distance
were
two
men
going
the
same
way
but
on
the
grass
by
the
roadside
whereas
david
was
on
the
middle
of
the
road
he
walks
well
for
jacky
tar
said
fullalove
iss
sar
said
vespasian
sulkily
but
dis
tink
he
not
walk
so
fast
as
those
two
behind
him
cos
they
catch
him
now
vespasian
had
hardly
uttered
these
words
when
a
thing
occurred
so
sudden
and
alarming
that
the
speaker
eyes
protruded
and
he
was
dumfounded
a
moment
the
next
a
loud
cry
burst
from
both
him
and
his
companion
at
once
and
they
lashed
their
horses
to
the
gallop
and
went
tearing
down
the
hill
in
a
fury
of
rage
and
apprehension
fullalove
was
right
i
think
a
sailor
is
seldom
a
smart
walker
but
dodd
was
a
cricketer
you
know
as
well
he
swung
along
at
a
good
pace
and
in
high
spirits
he
had
lost
nothing
but
a
few
clothes
and
a
quadrant
and
a
chronometer
it
was
a
cheap
wreck
to
him
and
a
joyful
one
for
peril
past
is
present
delight
he
had
saved
his
life
and
what
he
valued
more
his
children
money
never
was
that
dear
companion
of
his
perils
so
precious
to
him
as
now
one
might
almost
fancy
that
by
some
strange
sympathy
he
felt
the
immediate
happiness
of
his
daughter
depended
on
it
many
in
my
day
believe
that
human
minds
can
thus
communicate
overleaping
material
distances
not
knowing
i
ca
say
however
no
such
solution
is
really
needed
here
all
the
members
of
a
united
and
loving
family
feel
together
and
work
together
without
specific
concert
though
hemispheres
lie
between
it
is
one
of
the
beautiful
traits
of
true
family
affection
now
the
dodds
father
mother
sister
brother
were
more
one
in
heart
and
love
than
any
other
family
i
ever
saw
woe
to
them
if
they
had
not
david
then
walked
towards
boulogne
that
afternoon
a
happy
man
already
he
tasted
by
anticipation
the
warm
caresses
of
his
wife
and
children
and
saw
himself
seated
at
the
hearth
with
those
beloved
ones
clustering
close
round
him
how
would
he
tell
them
its
adventures
its
dangers
from
pirates
its
loss
at
sea
its
recovery
its
wreck
its
coming
ashore
dry
as
a
bone
and
conclude
by
taking
it
out
of
his
bosom
and
dropping
it
in
his
wife
lap
with
cheer
boys
cheer
trudging
on
in
this
delightful
reverie
his
ear
detected
a
pitpat
at
some
distance
behind
him
he
looked
round
with
very
slight
curiosity
and
saw
two
men
coming
up
even
in
that
hasty
glance
he
recognised
the
foulface
of
andre
tiribout
a
face
not
to
be
forgotten
in
a
day
i
know
how
it
was
but
he
saw
in
a
moment
that
face
was
after
him
to
rob
him
and
he
naturally
enough
concluded
it
was
their
object
and
he
was
without
a
weapon
and
they
were
doubtless
armed
indeed
thibout
was
swinging
a
heavy
cudgel
poor
dodd
mind
went
into
a
whirl
and
his
body
into
a
cold
sweat
in
such
moments
men
live
a
year
to
gain
a
little
time
he
walked
swiftly
on
pretending
not
to
have
noticed
them
but
oh
his
eyes
roved
wildly
to
each
side
of
the
road
for
a
chance
of
escape
he
saw
none
to
his
right
was
a
precipitous
rock
to
his
left
a
profound
ravine
with
a
torrent
below
and
the
sides
scantily
clothed
with
and
bushes
he
was
in
fact
near
the
top
of
a
long
rising
ground
called
la
mauvaise
cote
on
account
of
a
murder
committed
there
two
hundred
years
ago
presently
he
heard
the
men
close
behind
him
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
at
the
side
of
the
ravine
a
flint
stone
about
the
size
of
two
fists
he
made
but
three
swift
strides
snatched
it
up
and
turned
to
meet
the
robbers
drawing
himself
up
high
and
showing
fight
in
every
inch
the
men
were
upon
him
his
change
of
attitude
was
so
sudden
and
fiery
that
they
recoiled
a
step
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
they
had
gone
too
far
to
retreat
they
divided
and
thibout
attacked
him
on
his
left
with
uplifted
cudgel
and
moinard
on
his
right
with
a
long
glittering
knife
the
latter
to
guard
his
head
from
the
stone
whipped
off
his
hat
and
held
it
before
his
head
but
dodd
was
what
is
called
left
handed
ambidexter
would
be
nearer
the
mark
he
carved
and
wrote
with
his
right
hand
heaved
weights
and
flung
with
his
left
he
stepped
forward
flung
the
stone
in
thibout
face
with
perfect
precision
and
that
bitter
impetus
a
good
thrower
lends
at
the
moment
of
delivery
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
shot
out
his
right
hand
and
caught
moinard
by
the
throat
sharper
and
fiercer
collision
was
never
seen
than
of
these
three
thibout
face
crashed
his
blood
squirted
all
round
the
stone
and
eight
yards
off
lay
that
assailant
on
his
back
moinard
was
more
fortunate
he
got
two
inches
of
his
knife
into
left
shoulder
at
the
very
moment
dodd
caught
him
in
his
vice
and
now
one
vengeful
hand
of
iron
grasped
him
felly
by
the
throat
another
seized
his
knife
arm
and
twisted
it
back
like
a
child
he
kicked
and
struggled
furiously
but
in
half
a
minute
the
mighty
english
arm
and
iron
fingers
held
the
limp
body
of
jacques
moinard
with
its
knees
knocking
temples
bursting
throat
relaxed
eyes
protruding
and
livid
tongue
lolling
down
to
his
chin
a
few
seconds
more
and
with
the
same
stalwart
arm
that
kept
his
relaxed
and
sinking
body
from
falling
dodd
gave
him
one
fierce
whirl
round
to
the
edge
of
the
road
then
put
a
foot
to
his
middle
and
spurned
his
carcase
with
amazing
force
and
fury
down
the
precipice
crunch
crunch
it
plunged
from
tree
to
tree
from
bush
to
bush
and
at
last
rolled
into
a
thick
bramble
and
there
stuck
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
but
dodd
had
no
sooner
sent
him
headlong
by
that
mighty
effort
than
his
own
sight
darkened
his
head
swam
and
after
staggering
a
little
way
he
sank
down
in
a
state
bordering
on
insensibility
meantime
fullalove
and
vespasian
were
galloping
down
the
opposite
hill
to
his
rescue
unfortunately
andre
thibout
was
not
dead
nor
even
mortally
wounded
he
was
struck
on
the
nose
and
mouth
that
nose
was
flat
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
half
of
his
front
teeth
were
battered
out
of
their
sockets
but
he
fell
not
from
the
brain
being
stunned
but
the
body
driven
to
earth
by
the
mere
physical
force
of
so
momentous
a
blow
knocked
down
like
a
ninepin
he
now
sat
up
bewildered
and
found
himself
in
a
pool
of
blood
his
own
he
had
little
sensation
of
pain
but
he
put
his
hand
to
his
face
and
found
scarce
a
trace
of
his
features
and
his
hand
came
away
gory
he
groaned
rising
to
his
feet
he
saw
dodd
sitting
at
some
distance
his
first
impulse
was
to
fly
from
so
terrible
an
antagonist
but
as
he
made
for
the
ravine
he
observed
that
dodd
was
in
a
helpless
condition
wounded
perhaps
by
moinard
and
where
was
moinard
nothing
visible
of
him
but
his
knife
that
lay
glittering
in
the
road
thibout
with
anxious
eye
turned
towards
dodd
kneeled
to
pick
it
up
and
in
the
act
a
drop
of
his
own
blood
fell
on
the
dust
beside
it
he
snarled
like
a
wounded
tiger
spat
out
teeth
and
crept
on
tiptoe
to
his
safe
revenge
awake
from
your
lethargy
or
you
are
a
dead
man
no
thibout
got
to
him
unperceived
and
the
knife
glittered
over
his
head
at
this
moment
the
air
seemed
to
fill
with
clattering
hoofs
and
voices
and
a
rang
dodd
heard
and
started
and
so
saw
his
peril
he
put
up
his
left
hand
to
parry
the
blow
but
feebly
luckily
for
him
thibout
eyes
were
now
turned
another
way
and
glaring
with
stupid
terror
out
of
his
mutilated
visage
a
gigantic
mounted
fiend
with
black
face
and
white
gleaming
rolling
eyes
was
coming
at
him
like
the
wind
uttering
horrid
howls
thibout
launched
himself
at
the
precipice
with
a
shriek
of
dismay
and
went
rolling
after
his
comrade
but
ere
he
had
gone
ten
yards
he
fell
across
a
young
and
hung
balanced
up
came
the
foaming
horses
fullalove
dismounted
hastily
and
fired
three
deliberate
shots
down
at
thibout
from
his
revolver
he
rolled
off
and
never
stopped
again
till
he
splashed
into
the
torrent
and
lay
there
staining
it
with
blood
from
his
battered
face
and
perforated
shoulder
vespasian
jumped
off
and
with
glistening
eyes
administered
some
good
brandy
to
dodd
he
unconscious
of
his
wound
a
slight
one
relieved
their
anxiety
by
assuring
them
somewhat
faintly
he
was
not
hurt
but
that
ever
since
that
tap
on
the
head
he
got
in
the
straits
of
gaspar
any
angry
excitement
told
on
him
made
his
head
swim
and
his
temples
seem
to
swell
from
the
inside
i
should
have
come
off
but
for
you
my
dear
friends
shake
hands
over
it
do
o
lord
bless
you
lord
bless
you
both
as
for
you
vespasian
i
do
think
you
are
my
guardian
angel
why
this
is
the
second
time
you
saved
my
life
no
it
is
for
it
the
now
you
git
along
massa
said
vespasian
you
berry
good
man
ridicalous
good
man
and
dis
child
no
gardening
angel
at
all
he
ar
a
darned
anatomy
with
such
a
look
of
offended
dignity
at
fullalove
after
examining
the
field
of
battle
and
comparing
notes
they
mounted
dodd
on
vespasian
horse
and
walked
quietly
till
dodd
head
got
better
and
then
they
cantered
on
three
abreast
vespasian
in
the
middle
with
one
sinewy
hand
on
each
horse
mane
and
such
was
his
muscular
power
that
he
often
relieved
his
feet
by
lifting
himself
clean
into
the
air
and
the
rest
of
the
time
his
toe
but
touched
the
ground
and
he
sailed
like
an
ostrich
and
grinned
and
chattered
like
a
monkey
sad
to
relate
neither
thibout
nor
moinard
was
ended
the
guillotine
stood
on
its
rights
meantime
what
was
left
of
them
crawled
back
to
the
town
stiff
and
sore
and
supped
together
moinard
on
liquids
only
and
vowed
revenge
on
all
wrecked
people
the
three
reached
boulogne
in
time
for
the
and
put
dodd
on
board
the
pair
decided
to
go
to
the
yankee
paradise
paris
they
parted
with
regret
and
tenderly
like
old
tried
friends
and
vespasian
told
dodd
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
though
he
was
in
point
of
fact
only
a
darned
anemo
he
felt
like
a
coloured
gemman
at
parting
from
his
dear
old
captain
the
master
of
the
knew
dodd
well
and
gave
him
a
nice
cot
to
sleep
in
he
tumbled
in
with
a
bad
headache
and
quite
worn
out
and
never
woke
for
fifteen
hours
and
when
he
did
wake
he
was
safe
at
barkington
he
and
it
landed
on
the
quay
he
made
for
home
on
the
way
he
passed
hardie
bank
a
firm
synonymous
in
his
mind
with
the
bank
of
england
a
thrill
of
joy
went
through
him
now
it
safe
when
he
first
sewed
it
on
in
china
it
seemed
secure
nowhere
except
on
his
own
person
but
since
then
the
manifold
perils
by
sea
and
land
it
had
encountered
through
being
on
him
had
caused
a
strong
reaction
in
his
mind
on
that
point
he
longed
to
see
it
safe
out
of
his
own
hands
and
in
good
custody
he
made
for
hardie
door
with
a
joyful
rush
waved
his
cap
over
his
head
in
triumph
and
entered
the
bank
with
it
ah
chapter
xv
the
hard
cash
sailed
from
canton
months
before
the
boat
race
at
henley
recorded
in
chapter
but
it
landed
in
barkington
a
fortnight
after
the
last
home
event
i
recorded
in
its
true
series
now
this
fortnight
as
it
happens
was
fruitful
of
incidents
and
must
be
dealt
with
at
once
after
that
love
and
cash
the
converging
branches
of
this
story
will
flow
together
in
one
stream
alfred
hardie
kept
faith
with
dodd
and
by
an
effort
she
appreciated
forbore
to
express
his
love
for
julia
except
by
the
pen
he
took
in
lloyd
shipping
news
and
got
it
down
by
rail
in
hopes
there
would
be
something
about
the
then
he
could
call
at
albion
villa
dodd
had
given
him
that
loophole
meantime
he
kept
moping
for
an
invitation
which
never
came
julia
was
now
comparatively
happy
and
so
indeed
was
alfred
but
then
the
male
of
our
species
likes
to
be
superlatively
happy
not
comparatively
and
that
dodd
forgot
or
perhaps
had
not
observed
one
day
sampson
was
at
albion
villa
and
alfred
knew
it
now
though
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
poor
alfred
not
to
hang
about
after
julia
until
her
father
return
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
lay
in
wait
for
sampson
and
hear
something
about
her
and
he
was
so
deep
in
love
that
even
a
word
at
from
her
lips
was
a
drop
of
dew
to
his
heart
so
he
strolled
up
towards
the
villa
he
had
nearly
reached
it
when
a
woman
ran
past
him
making
the
most
extraordinary
sounds
i
can
only
describe
it
as
screaming
under
her
breath
though
he
only
saw
her
back
he
recognised
maxley
one
back
differeth
from
another
whatever
you
may
have
been
told
to
the
contrary
in
novels
and
plays
he
called
to
her
she
took
no
notice
and
darted
wildly
through
the
gate
of
albion
villa
alfred
curiosity
was
excited
and
he
ventured
to
put
his
head
over
the
gate
but
maxley
had
disappeared
alfred
had
half
a
mind
to
go
in
and
inquire
if
anything
was
the
matter
it
would
be
a
good
excuse
while
he
hesitated
the
window
was
thrown
violently
up
and
sampson
looked
out
hy
hardie
my
good
fellow
for
heaven
sake
a
fly
and
a
fast
one
it
was
plain
something
very
serious
had
occurred
so
alfred
flew
towards
the
nearest
on
the
way
he
fell
in
with
a
chance
fly
drawn
up
at
a
he
jumped
on
the
box
and
drove
rapidly
towards
albion
villa
sampson
was
hobbling
to
meet
him
he
had
sprained
his
ankle
or
would
not
have
asked
for
a
conveyance
to
save
time
he
got
up
beside
alfred
and
told
him
to
drive
hard
to
little
friar
street
on
the
way
he
explained
hurriedly
maxley
had
burst
in
on
him
at
albion
villa
to
say
her
husband
was
dying
in
torment
and
indeed
the
symptoms
she
gave
were
alarming
and
if
correct
looked
very
like
lockjaw
but
her
description
had
been
cut
short
by
a
severe
attack
which
choked
her
and
turned
her
speechless
and
motionless
and
white
to
the
very
lips
sis
i
and
at
such
a
time
ye
know
but
these
women
are
as
unseasonable
as
they
are

here

and
he
hopped
into
the
house
faster
than
most
people
can
run
on
a
good
errand
alfred
flung
the
reins
to
a
cad
and
followed
him
the
room
was
nearly
full
of
terrified
neighbours
sampson
shouldered
them
all
roughly
out
of
his
way
and
there
on
a
bed
lay
maxley
gaunt
figure
in
agony
his
body
was
drawn
up
by
the
middle
into
an
arch
and
nothing
touched
the
bed
but
the
head
and
the
heels
the
toes
were
turned
back
in
the
most
extraordinary
contortion
and
the
teeth
set
by
the
rigour
of
the
convulsion
and
in
the
man
white
face
and
fixed
eyes
were
the
horror
and
anxiety
that
so
often
show
themselves
when
the
body
feels
itself
in
the
grip
of
death
osmond
the
surgeon
was
there
he
had
applied
a
succession
of
hot
cloths
to
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
was
trying
to
get
laudanum
down
the
throat
but
the
clenched
teeth
were
impassable
he
now
looked
up
and
said
politely
ah
sampson
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
the
seizure
is
of
a
cataleptic
nature
i
apprehend
the
treatment
hitherto
has
been
hot
epithems
to
the
abdomen
and
here
sampson
who
had
examined
the
patient
keenly
and
paid
no
more
attention
to
osmond
than
to
a
fly
buzzing
interrupted
him
as
unceremoniously
poisoned
said
he
philosophically
poisoned
screamed
the
people
poisoned
cried
osmond
in
whose
little
list
of
stereotyped
maladies
poisoned
had
no
place
is
there
any
one
you
have
reason
to
suspect
i
do
suspect
nor
conject
sir
i
know
the
man
is
poisoned
the
substance
strychnine
now
stand
out
of
the
way
you
gaping
gabies
and
let
me
work
hy
young
oxford
you
are
a
man
get
behind
and
hold
both
his
arms
for
your
life
that
you
he
whipped
off
his
coat
laid
hold
of
osmond
epithems
chucked
them
across
the
room
saying
you
may
just
as
well
squirt
at
a
house
on
fire
drenched
his
handkerchief
with
chloroform
sprang
upon
the
patient
like
a
mountain
cat
and
chloroformed
him
with
all
his
might
attacked
so
skilfully
and
resolutely
maxley
resisted
little
for
so
strong
a
man
but
the
potent
poison
within
fought
virulently
as
a
proof
the
chloroform
had
to
be
renewed
three
times
before
it
could
produce
any
effect
at
last
the
patient
yielded
to
the
fumes
and
became
insensible
then
the
arched
body
subsided
and
the
rigid
muscles
relaxed
and
turned
supple
sampson
kneaded
the
man
like
dough
by
way
of
comment
it
is
really
very
extraordinary
said
osmond
mai
dearr
sirr
nothing
extraornary
t
a
man
that
knows
the
reason
of
he
then
inquired
if
any
one
in
the
room
had
noticed
at
what
intervals
of
time
the
pains
came
on
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
is
continuous
said
osmond
mai
dearr
sirr
nothing
on
airth
is
continuous
iverything
has
paroxysms
and
remissions
from
a
toothache
t
a
he
repeated
his
query
in
various
forms
till
at
last
a
little
girl
squeaked
out
if
sir
the
throes
do
come
about
every
ten
minutes
for
i
was
a
looking
at
the
clock
i

his
dinner
at

you

half
a
guinea
for

especially
the
and
he
jerked
her
half
a
sovereign
a
stupor
fell
on
the
assembly
they
awoke
from
it
to
examine
the
coin
and
see
if
it
was
real
or
only
yellow
air
maxley
came
to
and
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
had
been
insensible
yet
out
of
pain
nearly
eight
minutes
by
the
clock
sampson
chloroformed
him
again
i
puzzle
ye
my
friend
strych
said
he
how
will
ye
get
your
perriodical
paroxysms
when
the
man
is
insensible
the
dox
say
act
direct
on
the
spinal
marrow
well
there
the
spinal
marrow
where
you
found
it
just
now
act
on
it
again
my
lad
i
give
ye
leave
if
ye
can
ye
ca
bekase
ye
must
pass
through
the
brain
to
get
there
and
i
occupy
the
brain
with
a
swifter
ajint
than
y
are
and
mean
to
keep
out
of
it
till
your
power
to
kill
evaporates
being
a
with
this
his
spirits
mounted
and
he
indulged
in
a
harmless
and
favourite
fiction
he
feigned
the
company
were
all
males
and
medical
students
osmond
included
and
he
the
lecturer
now
jintlemen
said
he
obsairve
the
great
therey
of
the
perriodeecity
and
remitteney
of
all
disease
in
conjunckshin
with
its
practice
all
diseases
have
paroxysms
and
remissions
which
occur
at
intervals
sometimes
it
a
year
sometimes
a
day
an
hour
ten
minutes
but
whatever
th
interval
they
are
true
to
it
they
keep
time
only
when
the
disease
is
retirin
the
remissions
become
longer
the
paroxysms
return
at
a
greater
interval
and
just
the
revairse
when
the
pashint
is
to
die
this
jintlemen
is
man
life
from
the
womb
to
the
grave
the
throes
that
precede
his
birth
are
remittent
like
ivery
thing
else
but
come
at
diminished
intervals
when
he
has
really
made
up
his
mind
to
be
born
his
first
mistake
sirs
but
not
his
last
and
the
paroxysms
of
his
mortal
disease
come
at
shorter
intervals
when
he
is
really
goon
off
the
hooks
but
still
chronometrically
just
as
watches
keep
time
whether
they
go
fast
or
slow
now
jintlemen
is
this
a
beautiful
therey
oh
mercy
oh
good
people
help
me
oh
jesus
christ
have
pity
on
me
and
the
sufferer
body
was
bent
like
a
bow
and
his
eyes
filled
with
horror
and
his
toes
pointed
at
his
chin
the
doctor
hurled
himself
on
the
foe
come
said
he
smell
to
this
lad
that
right
he
is
better
already
jintlemen
or
he
could
howl
ye
know
deevil
a
howl
in
um
before
i
gave
um
puff
chlorofm
ah
would
ye
would
ye
oh
oh
oh
oh
ugh
ah
the
doctor
got
off
the
insensible
body
and
resumed
his
lecture
calmly
like
one
who
has
disposed
of
some
childish
interruption
and
now
to
th
application
of
the
therey
if
the
poison
can
reduce
the
tin
interval
to
five
minutes
this
pashint
will
die
and
if
i
can
get
the
tin
minutes
up
t
half
hour
this
pashint
will
live
any
way
jintlemen
we
wo
detain
y
unreasonably
the
case
shall
be
at
an
end
by
one
on
hearing
this
considerate
stipulation
up
went
three
women
aprons
to
their
eyes
alack
poor
james
maxley
he
is
at
his
last
hour
it
be
just
gone
twelve
and
a
dies
at
sampson
turned
on
the
weepers
who
says
that
y
ijjits
i
said
the
case
would
end
at
one
a
case
ends
when
the
pashint
gets
well
or
oh
that
is
good
news
for
poor
susan
maxley
her
man
is
to
be
well
by
one
doctor
sampson
groaned
and
gave
in
he
was
strong
but
not
strong
enough
to
make
the
populance
suspend
an
opinion
yet
methinks
it
might
be
done
by
chloroforming
them
the
spasms
came
at
longer
intervals
and
less
violent
and
maxley
got
so
fond
of
the
essence
of
insensibility
that
he
asked
to
have
some
in
his
own
hand
to
apply
at
the
first
warning
of
the
horrible
pains
sampson
said
any
fool
can
complete
the
cure
and
by
way
of
practical

left
him
in
osmond
charge
but
with
an
understanding
that
the
treatment
should
not
be
varied
that
no
laudanum
should
be
given
but
in
due
course
a
stiff
tumbler
of
brandy
and
water
or
two
if
he
gets
drunk
all
the
better
a
little
intoxication
weakens
the
memory
of
the
pain
it
has
endured
and
so
expedites
the
cure
now
off
we
go
to
th
the
body
memory
said
osmond
to
himself
what
on
earth
does
the
quack
mean
the
driver
of
the
fly
was
not
quite
drunk
enough
to
lose
his
horse
and
vehicle
without
missing
them
he
was
on
the
look
out
for
the
robber
and
as
alfred
came
round
the
corner
full
pelt
darted
at
the
reins
with
a
husky
remonstrance
and
alfred
cut
into
him
with
the
whip
an
angry
explanation
a
guinea
and
behold
the
driver
sitting
behind
complacent
and
nodding
arrived
at
albion
villa
alfred
asked
sampson
submissively
if
he
might
come
in
and
see
the
wife
cured
why
of
course
said
sampson
not
knowing
the
delicate
position
then
ask
me
in
before
dodd
murmured
alfred
coaxingly
oo
ay
said
the
doctor
knowingly
i
maxley
was
in
the
she
had
got
well
of
herself
but
was
crying
bitterly
and
the
ladies
would
not
let
her
go
home
yet
they
feared
the
worst
and
that
some
one
would
blurt
it
out
to
her
to
this
anxious
trio
entered
sampson
radiant
there
it
all
right
come
little
maxley
ye
need
cry
he
has
got
lots
more
mischief
to
do
in
the
world
yet
but
o
wumman
it
is
lucky
you
came
to
me
and
not
to
any
of
the
tinkering
dox
no
more
cat
and
dog
for
you
and
him
but
for
the
chronothairmal
therey
and
you
may
bless
my
puppy
four
bones
too
he
ran
and
stole
a
fly
like
a
man
and
drove
now
if
i
had
got
to
your
house
two
minutes
later
your
jamie
would
have
lairned
the
great
secret
ere
he
threw
up
the
window
haw
you
come
away
and
receive
the
applause
due
from
beauty
t
alfred
came
in
timidly
and
was
received
with
perfect
benignity
and
by
dodd
but
julia
face
was
dyed
with
blushes
and
her
eyes
sparkled
the
eloquent
praise
she
was
ashamed
to
speak
before
them
all
but
such
a
face
as
her
scarce
needed
the
help
of
a
voice
at
such
a
time
and
indeed
both
the
lovers
faces
were
a
pretty
sight
and
a
study
how
they
stole
loving
glances
but
tried
to
keep
within
bounds
and
not
steal
more
than
three
per
minute
and
how
unconscious
they
endeavoured
to
look
the
intervening
seconds
and
what
windows
were
the
demure
complacent
visages
they
thought
they
were
making
shutters
of
innocent
love
has
at
least
this
advantage
over
melodramatic
that
it
can
extract
exquisite
sweetness
out
of
so
small
a
thing
these
sweethearts
were
not
alone
could
not
open
their
hearts
must
not
even
gaze
too
long
yet
to
be
in
the
same
room
even
on
such
terms
was
a
taste
of
heaven
but
dear
heart
said
maxley
ye
do
tell
me
what
he
ailed
if
you
had
seen
him
you
would
have
said
he
was
taken
for
pray
what
the
complaint
inquired
dodd
oh
did
i
tell
ye
this
intelligence
was
conveyed
with
true
scientific
calmness
and
received
with
feminine
ejaculations
of
horror
maxley
was
indignant
into
the
bargain
do
ye
go
giving
my
house
an
ill
name
we
keeps
no
sampson
fixed
his
eyes
sternly
on
her
wumman
ye
know
better
ye
keep
strychnine
for
th
use
and
delectation
of
your
domestic
strychnine
i
never
heard
tell
of
it
is
that
latin
for
arsenic
now
is
this
lamentable
why
arsenic
is
a
mital
strychnine
a
vigitable
me
your
man
was
here
seeking
strychnine
to
poison
his
mouse
a
harmless
domistic
necessary
mouse
i
told
him
mice
were
a
part
of
nature
as
much
as
maxleys
and
life
as
sweet
tit
as
tim
but
he
was
dif
to
scientific
and
chrisehin
preceps
so
i
told
him
to
go
to
the
deevil
will
sis
he
and
went
t
a
docker
the
two
assassins
have
poisoned
the
poor
beastie
between
and
thin
been
the
greatest
miser
in
the
world
except
one
he
will
have
roasted
his
victim
and
ate
her
on
the
sly
imprignated
with
strychnine
steal
a
march
on
miser
sis
he
and
that
you
t
his
brain
flew
the
strychnine
his
brain
sint
it
to
his
spinal
marrow
and
we
found
my
lorrd
bent
like
a
bow
and
his
jaw
locked
and
nearer
knowin
the
great
secret
than
any
man
in
england
will
be
this
year
to
live
and
sairves
the
assassinating
old
vagabin
heaven
forgive
you
doctor
said
maxley
half
mechanically
for
curin
a
murrderer
not
maxley
who
had
shown
signs
of
singular
uneasiness
during
explanation
now
rose
and
said
in
a
very
peculiar
tone
she
must
go
home
directly
dodd
seemed
to
enter
into
her
feelings
and
made
her
go
in
the
fly
taking
care
to
pay
the
fare
and
the
driver
out
of
her
own
purse
as
the
woman
got
into
the
fly
sampson
gave
her
a
piece
of
friendly
and
practical
advice
nixt
time
he
has
a
mind
to
breakfast
on
strychnine
you
tell
me
and
i
put
a
pinch
of
arsenic
in
the
and
cure
him
safe
as
the
bank
but
this
time
he
have
been
did
and
stiff
long
before
such
a
slow
ajint
as
arsenic
could
get
a
hold
on
they
sat
down
to
luncheon
but
neither
alfred
nor
julia
fed
much
except
upon
sweet
stolen
looks
and
soon
the
active
sampson
jumped
up
and
invited
alfred
to
go
round
his
patients
alfred
could
not
decline
but
made
his
adieux
with
regret
so
tender
and
undisguised
that
sweet
eyes
filled
and
her
soft
hand
instinctively
pressed
his
at
parting
to
console
him
she
blushed
at
herself
afterwards
but
at
the
time
she
was
thinking
only
of
him
maxley
and
his
wife
came
up
in
the
evening
with
a
fee
they
had
put
their
heads
together
and
proffered
one
guinea
man
and
wife
be
one
flesh
you
know
doctor
said
the
rustic
miser
sampson
whose
natural
choler
was
constantly
checked
by
his
humour
declined
this
profuse
proposal
here
vanity
said
he
now
do
you
really
think
your
two
lives
are
worth
a
guinea
why
it
pence
farthings
the
pair
affected
disappointment
vilely
at
all
events
he
must
accept
this
basket
of
gudgeons
maxley
had
brought
along
being
poisoned
was
quite
out
of
maxley
daily
routine
and
had
so
unsettled
him
that
he
had
got
up
and
gone
fishing
to
the
amazement
of
the
parish
sampson
inspected
the
basket
why
they
are
only
fish
said
he
i
was
in
hopes
they
were
he
accepted
the
gudgeons
and
inquired
how
maxley
got
poisoned
it
came
out
that
maxley
seeing
her
husband
set
apart
a
portion
of
his
welsh
rabbit
had
grizzled
and
asked
what
that
was
for
and
being
told
for
the
mouse
and
to
mind
her
own
business
had
grizzled
still
more
and
furtively
conveyed
a
portion
back
into
the
pan
for
her
master
own
use
she
had
been
quaking
dismally
all
the
afternoon
at
what
she
had
done
but
finding
maxley
hard
but
just
did
not
attack
her
for
an
involuntary
fault
she
now
brazened
it
out
and
said
men
did
ought
to
have
poison
in
the
house
unbeknown
to
their
wives
jem
had
got
no
more
than
he
worked
for
but
like
a
woman
she
vowed
vengeance
on
the
mouse
whereupon
maxley
threatened
her
with
the
marital
correction
of
if
she
laid
a
finger
on
it
my
eyes
be
open
now
to
what
a
poor
creature
do
feel
as
dies
poisoned
let
her
a
be
there
room
in
our
place
for
her
and
next
day
he
met
alfred
and
thanked
him
with
warmth
almost
with
emotion
there
ai
many
in
barkington
as
ever
done
me
a
good
turn
master
alfred
you
be
one
on
you
comes
after
the
captain
in
my
book
alfred
suggested
that
his
claims
were
humble
compared
with
sampson
no
no
said
maxley
going
down
to
his
whisper
and
looking
monstrous
wise
doctor
did
go
out
of
his
business
for
me
you
the
sage
miser
gratitude
had
not
time
to
die
a
natural
death
before
circumstances
occurred
to
test
it
on
the
morning
of
that
eventful
day
which
concluded
my
last
chapter
he
received
a
letter
from
canada
his
wife
was
out
with
eggs
so
he
caught
little
rose
sutton
that
had
more
than
once
spelled
an
epistle
for
him
and
she
read
it
out
in
a
loud
and
reckless
whine
noon
this
very
daie
muster
hardie
aguent
dis

their
fingers
be
longer

i
do
maxley
hailed
thus
information
characteristically
then
we
say
no
more
about
the
at
this
rose
raised
a
lamentable
cry
and
pearly
tears
gushed
forth
there
there
said
maxley
deprecatingly
here
two
apples
for
ye
ye
ca
get
them
for
less
and
a
halfpenny
or
a
haporth
is
all
one
to
you
but
it
is
a
great
odds
to
me
and
apples
they
rot
halfpence
it
was
now
nine
the
bank
did
not
open
till
ten
but
maxley
went
and
hung
about
the
door
to
be
the
first
applicant
as
he
stood
there
trembling
with
fear
lest
the
bank
should
not
open
at
all
he
thought
hard
and
the
result
was
a
double
resolution
he
would
have
his
money
out
to
the
last
shilling
and
this
done
would
button
up
his
pockets
and
padlock
his
tongue
it
was
not
his
business
to
take
care
of
his
neighbours
nor
to
blow
the
hardies
if
they
paid
him
his
money
on
demand
so
not
a
word
to
my
missus
nor
yet
to
the
said
he
ten
struck
and
the
bank
shutters
remained
up
five
minutes
more
and
the
watcher
was
in
agony
three
minutes
more
and
up
came
a
boy
of
sixteen
whistling
and
took
down
the
shutters
with
an
indifference
that
amazed
him
bless
your
handsome
face
said
maxley
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
now
summoned
up
all
his
firmness
and
having
recourse
to
an
art
in
which
these
shrewd
rustics
are
supreme
made
his
face
quite
inexpressive
and
so
walked
into
the
bank
the
maxley
externally
but
within
a
volcano
ready
to
burst
if
there
should
be
the
slightest
hesitation
to
pay
him
his
money
good
morning
maxley
said
young
skinner

facial
muscle

the

round
that
there
henry
score
james
maxley
name
off
the
books
said
skinner
with
cool
dignity
but
when
he
had
said
this
he
was
at
his
wits
end
there
were
not
nine
hundred
pounds
of
hard
cash
in
the
bank
nor
anything
like
it
chapter
xvi
skinner
called
young
because
he
had
once
had
a
father
on
the
premises
was
the
the
feelings
with
which
he
had
now
for
some
months
watched
his
master
grubbing
were
curiously
mingled
there
was
the
grim
sense
of
superiority
every
successful
detective
feels
as
he
sees
the
watched
one
working
away
unconscious
of
the
eye
that
is
on
him
but
this
was
more
than
balanced
by
a
long
habit
of
obsequious
reverence
when
has
been
looking
up
to
for
thirty
years
he
can
not
look
down
on
him
all
of
a
sudden
merely
because
he
catches
him
falsifying
accounts
why
man
is
a
cooking
animal
bankrupt
man
especially
and
then
richard
hardie
overpowered
skinner
senses
he
was
dignity
in
person
he
was
six
feet
two
and
always
wore
a
black
surtout
buttoned
high
and
a
hat
with
a
brim
a
little
broader
than
his
neighbours
yet
not
broad
enough
to
be
eccentric
or
slang
he
moved
down
the
street
touching
his
hat
while
other
hats
were
lifted
high
to
him
a
walking
volume
of
cash
and
when
he
took
off
this
ebon
crown
and
sat
in
the
bank
parlour
he
gained
in
appearance
more
than
he
lost
for
then
his
whole
head
was
seen
long
calm
majestic
that
senatorial
front
and
furrowed
face
overawed
all
comers
even
the
little
clerk
would
stand
and
peep
at
it
utterly
puzzled
between
what
he
knew
and
what
he
eyed
nor
could
he
look
at
that
head
and
face
without
excusing
them
what
a
lot
of
money
they
must
have
sunk
before
they
came
down
to
fabricating
a
and
custom
somewhat
blunted
his
sense
of
the
dishonesty
and
he
began
to
criticise
the
thing
arithmetically
instead
of
morally
that
view
once
admitted
he
was
charmed
with
the
ability
and
subtlety
of
his
dignified
sharper
and
so
the
began
gradually
but
effectually
to
be
corrupted
by
the
mole
he
who
watches
a
dishonest
process
and
does
not
stop
it
is
half
way
towards
conniving
who
connives
is
half
way
towards
abetting
the
next
thing
was
skinner
felt
mortified
at
his
master
not
trusting
him
did
he
think
old
bob
skinner
son
would
blow
on
hardie
after
all
these
years
this
rankled
a
little
and
set
him
to
console
himself
by
admiring
his
own
cleverness
in
penetrating
this
great
distrustful
man
now
of
all
sentiments
vanity
is
the
most
restless
and
the
surest
to
peep
out
skinner
was
no
sooner
inflated
than
his
demure
obsequious
manner
underwent
a
certain
change
slight
and
occasional
only
but
hardie
was
a
subtle
man
and
the
perilous
path
he
was
treading
made
him
wonderfully
watchful
suspicious
and
sagacious
he
said
to
himself
what
has
come
to
skinner
i
must
so
he
quietly
watched
his
watcher
and
soon
satisfied
himself
he
suspected
something
amiss
from
that
hour
skinner
was
a
doomed
clerk
it
was
two
hardie
had
just
arrived
and
sat
in
the
parlour
and
cooking
skinner
was
in
high
spirits
it
was
owing
to
his
presence
of
mind
the
bank
had
not
been
broken
some
hours
ago
by
maxley
so
now
while
concluding
his
work
he
was
enjoying
by
anticipation
his
gratitude
he
ca
hold
aloof
after
this
said
skinner
he
must
honour
me
with
his
confidence
and
i
will
deserve
it
i
do
deserve
a
grave
calm
passionless
voice
invited
him
into
the
parlour
he
descended
from
his
desk
and
went
in
swelling
with
demure
complacency
he
found
hardie
seated
garbling
his
accounts
with
surpassing
dignity
the
great
man
handed
him
an
envelope
and
cooked
majestic
on
a
wave
of
that
imperial
hand
and
skinner
had
mingled
with
the
past
for
know
that
the
envelope
contained
three
things
a
cheque
for
a
month
wages
a
character
and
a
dismissal
very
polite
and
equally
peremptory
skinner
stood
paralysed
the
complacency
died
out
of
his
face
and
rueful
wonder
came
instead
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
utter
a
word
at
last
he
faltered
turn
me
away
sir
turn
away
noah
skinner
your
father
would
never
have
said
such
a
word
to
skinner
uttered
this
his
first
remonstrance
in
a
voice
trembling
with
awe
but
gathered
courage
when
he
found
he
had
done
it
yet
lived
hardie
evaded
his
expostulation
by
a
very
simple
means
he
made
no
reply
but
continued
his
work
dignified
as
brutus
inexorable
as
fate
cool
as
cucumber
skinner
anger
began
to
rise
he
watched
hardie
in
silence
and
said
to
himself
curse
you
you
were
born
without
a
heart
he
waited
however
for
some
sign
of
relenting
and
hoping
for
it
the
water
came
into
his
own
eyes
but
hardie
was
impassive
as
ice
then
the
little
clerk
mortified
to
the
core
as
well
as
wounded
ground
his
teeth
and
drew
a
little
nearer
to
this
incarnate
arithmetic
and
said
with
an
excess
of
obsequiousness
will
you
condescend
to
give
me
a
reason
for
turning
me
away
all
in
a
moment
after
faithful
services
men
of
business
do
not
deal
in
reasons
was
the
cool
reply
it
is
enough
for
you
that
i
give
you
an
excellent
character
and
that
we
part
good
that
we
do
not
replied
skinner
sharply
if
we
stay
together
we
are
friends
but
we
part
enemies
if
we
do
as
you
please
skinner
i
will
detain
you
no
and
hardie
waved
him
away
so
grandly
that
he
started
and
almost
ran
to
the
door
when
he
felt
the
handle
it
acted
like
a
prop
to
his
heart
he
stood
firm
and
rage
supplied
the
place
of
steady
courage
he
clung
to
the
door
and
whispered
at
his
master
such
a
whisper
so
loud
so
cutting
so
full
of
meaning
and
malice
it
was
like
a
serpent
hissing
at
a
man
but
i
give
a
reason
a
good
reason
why
you
had
better
not
insult
me
so
cruel
and
what
is
more
i
give
you
two
and
one
is
that
but
for
me
the
bank
must
have
closed
this
day
at
ten
ay
you
may
stare
it
was
i
saved
it
not
you
and
the
other
is
that
if
you
make
an
enemy
of
me
you
are
done
for
i
know
too
much
to
be
made
an
enemy
of
sir
a
great
deal
too
at
this
hardie
raised
his
head
from
his
book
and
eyed
his
crouching
venomous
assailant
full
in
the
face
majestically
as
one
can
fancy
a
lion
rearing
his
ponderous
head
and
looking
lazily
and
steadily
at
a
snake
that
has
just
hissed
in
a
corner
each
word
of
skinner
was
a
barbed
icicle
to
him
yet
not
a
muscle
of
his
close
countenance
betrayed
his
inward
suffering
one
thing
however
even
he
could
not
master
his
blood
it
retired
from
that
stoical
cheek
to
the
chilled
and
foreboding
heart
and
the
sudden
pallor
of
the
resolute
face
told
skinner
his
shafts
had
gone
home
come
sir
said
he
affecting
to
mingle
good
fellowship
with
his
defiance
why
bundle
me
off
these
premises
when
you
will
be
bundled
off
them
yourself
before
the
week
is
out
you
insolent
scoundrel
humph
explain
ah
what
have
i
warmed
your
marble
up
a
bit
yes
i
explain
the
bank
is
rotten
and
ca
last
oh
indeed
blighted
in
a
day
by
the
dismissal
of
noah
skinner
do
not
repeat
that
after
you
have
been
turned
into
the
streets
or
you
will
be
indicted
at
present
we
are
confidential
anything
more
before
you
quit
the
rotten
bank
yes
sir
plenty
i
tell
you
your
own
history
past
present
and
to
come
the
road
to
riches
is
hard
and
rugged
to
the
likes
of
me
but
your
good
father
made
it
smooth
and
easy
to
you
sir
you
had
only
to
take
the
money
of
a
lot
of
fools
that
fancy
they
ca
keep
it
themselves
invest
it
in
consols
and
exchequer
bills
live
on
half
the
profits
put
by
the
rest
and
roll
in
wealth
but
this
was
too
slow
and
too
sure
for
you
you
must
be
rothschild
in
a
day
so
you
went
into
blind
speculation
and
flung
old
hardie
savings
into
a
well
and
now
for
the
last
eight
months
you
have
been
doctoring
the
ledger
hardie
winced
just
perceptibly
you
have
put
down
our
gains
in
white
our
losses
in
black
and
so
you
keep
feeding
your
and
empty
our
tills
the
pear
will
soon
be
ripe
and
then
you
will
let
it
drop
and
into
the
bankruptcy
court
we
go
but
what
you
forget
fraudulent
bankruptcy
is
the
turnpike
way
of
trade
it
is
a
broad
road
but
a
crooked
one
skirts
the
prison
wall
sir
and
sights
the
an
agony
went
across
hardie
great
face
and
seemed
to
furrow
as
it
ran
not
but
what
you
are
all
right
sir
resumed
his
little
tormentor
letting
him
go
a
little
way
to
nail
him
again
you
have
cooked
the
books
in
time
and
cocker
was
a
fool
to
you
be
all
down
in
black
and
white
great
sacrifices
no
reserve
creditors
take
everything
dividend
fourpence
in
the
pound
furniture
of
house
and
bank
hardie
portrait
and
down
to
the
coalscuttle
bankrupt
saves
nothing
but
his
honour
and
the
six
thousand
pounds
or
so
he
has
stitched
into
his
old
hands
his
new
one
to
the
official
assignees
like
an
honest
hardie
uttered
something
between
a
growl
and
a
moan
now
comes
the
per
contra
poor
little
despised
noah
skinner
has
kept
genuine
books
while
you
have
been
preparing
false
ones
i
took
the
real
figures
home
every
afternoon
on
loose
leaves
and
bound
and
very
curious
they
will
read
in
court
alongside
of
yours
i
did
it
for
amusement
o
nights
i
so
solitary
and
so
fond
of
figures
i
must
try
and
turn
them
to
profit
for
i
out
of
place
now
in
my
old
age
dearee
me
how
curious
that
you
should
go
and
pick
out
me
of
all
men
to
turn
into
the
street
like
a
dog
like
a
dog
like
a
hardie
turned
his
head
away
and
in
that
moment
of
humiliation
and
abject
fear
drank
all
the
bitterness
of
moral
death
his
manhood
urged
him
to
defy
skinner
and
return
to
the
straight
path
cost
what
it
might
but
how
could
he
his
own
books
were
all
falsified
he
could
place
a
true
before
his
creditors
by
simply
adding
the
contents
of
his
secret
hoard
to
the
assets
of
the
bank
but
with
this
true
arithmetical
result
he
could
not
square
his
books
except
by
conjectural
and
fabricated
details
which
would
be
detected
and
send
him
to
prison
for
who
would
believe
he
was
lying
in
figures
only
to
get
back
to
the
truth
no
he
had
entangled
himself
in
his
own
fraud
and
was
at
the
mercy
of
his
servant
he
took
his
line
skinner
it
was
your
interest
to
leave
me
whilst
the
bank
stood
then
you
would
have
got
a
place
directly
but
since
you
take
umbrage
at
my
dismissing
you
for
your
own
good
i
must
punish
you
by
keeping
i
am
quite
ready
to
stay
and
serve
you
sir
replied
skinner
hastily
and
as
for
my
angry
words
think
no
more
of
them
it
went
to
my
heart
to
be
turned
away
at
the
very
time
you
need
me
hypocritical
rogue
thought
hardie
that
is
true
skinner
said
he
i
do
indeed
need
a
faithful
and
sympathising
servant
to
advise
support
and
aid
me
ask
yourself
whether
any
man
in
england
needs
a
confidant
more
than
i
it
was
bitter
at
first
to
be
discovered
even
by
you
but
now
i
am
glad
you
know
all
for
i
see
i
have
undervalued
your
ability
as
well
as
your
thus
hardie
bowed
his
pride
to
flatter
skinner
and
soon
saw
by
the
little
fellow
heightened
colour
that
this
was
the
way
to
make
him
a
clerk
of
wax
the
banker
and
his
clerk
were
reconciled
then
the
latter
was
invited
to
commit
himself
by
carrying
on
the
culinary
process
in
his
own
hand
he
trembled
a
little
but
complied
and
so
became
an
accomplice
on
this
his
master
took
him
into
his
confidence
and
told
him
everything
it
was
impossible
to
hide
from
him
and
now
sir
said
skinner
let
me
tell
you
what
i
did
for
you
this
morning
then
perhaps
you
wo
wonder
at
my
being
so
peppery
maxley
he
came
here
and
drew
out
every
shilling
i
was
all
in
a
perspiration
what
to
do
but
i
put
a
good
face
on
and
skinner
then
confided
to
his
principal
how
he
had
evaded
maxley
and
saved
the
bank
and
the
stratagem
seemed
so
incredible
and
droll
that
they
both
laughed
over
it
long
and
loud
and
in
fact
it
turned
out
a
practical
jest
cost
two
lives
while
they
were
laughing
the
young
clerk
looked
in
and
said
captain
dodd
to
speak
with
you
sir
captain
dodd
and
all
hardie
forced
merriment
died
away
and
his
face
betrayed
his
vexation
for
once
did
you
go
and
tell
him
i
was
here
yes
sir
i
had
no
orders
and
he
said
you
would
be
sure
to
see
unfortunate
well
you
may
show
him
in
when
i
ring
your
the
youngster
being
gone
hardie
explained
to
his
new
ally
in
a
few
hurried
words
the
danger
that
threatened
him
from
miss
julia
dodd
and
now
said
he
the
women
have
sent
her
father
to
soften
his
i
shall
be
told
his
girl
will
die
if
she
ca
have
my
boy
as
if
i
care
who
lives
or
on
this
skinner
got
up
all
in
a
hurry
and
offered
to
go
into
the
office
on
no
account
said
hardie
sharply
i
shall
make
my
business
with
you
the
excuse
for
cutting
this
mighty
short
take
your
book
to
the
desk
and
seem
buried
in
he
then
touched
the
bell
and
both
confederates
fell
into
an
attitude
never
were
a
pair
so
bent
over
their
little
accounts
lies
like
themselves
instead
of
the
father
their
comedy
awaited
in
came
the
gallant
sailor
with
a
brown
cheek
reddened
by
triumph
and
excitement
and
almost
shouted
in
a
genial
jocund
voice
how
d
do
sir
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
came
across
your
and
with
this
he
held
out
his
hand
cordially
hardie
gave
his
mechanically
and
remained
on
his
guard
but
somewhat
puzzled
dodd
shook
his
cold
hand
heartily
well
sir
here
i
am
just
come
ashore
and
visiting
you
before
my
very
wife
what
d
think
of
that
i
am
highly
honoured
sir
said
hardie
then
rather
stiffly
and
incredulously
and
to
what
may
i
owe
this
extraordinary
preference
will
you
be
good
enough
to
state
the
purport
of
this
visit
briefly
as
skinner
and
i
are
much
occupied
the
purport
why
what
does
one
come
to
a
banker
about
i
have
got
a
lot
of
money
i
want
to
get
rid
hardie
stared
but
was
as
much
on
his
guard
as
ever
only
more
and
more
puzzled
then
david
winked
at
him
with
simple
cunning
took
out
his
knife
undid
his
shirt
and
began
to
cut
the
threads
which
bound
the
cash
to
his
flannel
at
this
skinner
wheeled
round
on
his
stool
to
look
and
both
he
and
hardie
inspected
the
unusual
pantomime
with
demure
curiosity
dodd
next
removed
the
oilskin
cover
and
showed
the
brought
it
down
with
a
triumphant
smack
on
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
in
the
pride
of
his
heart
the
joy
of
his
bosom
and
the
fever
of
his
blood
for
there
were
two
red
spots
on
his
cheek
all
the
time
told
the
cold
pair
its
adventures
in
a
few
glowing
words
the
calcutta
firm
the
two
pirates
the
hurricane
the
wreck
the
he
had
saved
it
from
and
here
it
is
safe
in
spite
of
them
all
but
i
wo
carry
it
on
me
any
more
it
is
unlucky
so
you
must
be
so
good
as
to
take
charge
of
it
for
me
very
well
captain
dodd
you
wish
it
placed
to
dodd
account
i
suppose
no
no
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
this
is
between
you
and
as
you
ye
see
it
is
a
good
lump
oh
indeed
said
hardie
a
little
sneeringly
i
call
it
a
thundering
lot
o
money
but
i
suppose
it
is
not
much
to
a
rich
banker
like
then
he
lowered
his
voice
and
said
with
a
certain
awe
it
fourteen
thousand
fourteen
thousand
pounds
cried
hardie
then
with
sudden
and
consummate
coolness
why
certainly
an
established
bank
like
this
deals
with
more
considerable
deposits
than
that
skinner
why
do
you
give
the
captain
a
chair
no
no
said
dodd
i
till
i
get
this
off
my
mind
but
i
wo
anchor
anywhere
but
at
he
then
opened
the
and
spread
the
contents
out
before
hardie
who
ran
over
the
notes
and
bills
and
said
the
amount
was
dodd
asked
for
a
receipt
why
it
is
not
usual
when
there
is
an
dodd
countenance
fell
oh
i
should
not
like
to
part
with
it
unless
i
had
a
you
mistake
me
said
hardie
with
a
smile
an
entry
in
your
book
is
a
receipt
however
you
can
have
one
in
another
he
then
unlocked
a
desk
took
out
a
banker
receipt
and
told
skinner
to
fill
it
in
this
done
he
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
some
more
important
matter
skinner
counted
the
notes
and
left
them
with
hardie
the
bills
he
took
to
his
desk
to
note
them
on
the
back
of
the
receipt
whilst
he
was
writing
this
with
his
usual
slowness
and
precision
poor
dodd
heart
overflowed
it
is
my
children
fortune
ye
see
i
do
look
on
a
sixpence
of
it
as
mine
that
it
is
what
made
me
so
particular
it
belongs
to
my
little
julia
bless
her
she
is
a
rosebud
if
ever
there
was
one
and
oh
such
a
heart
and
so
fond
of
her
poor
father
but
not
fonder
than
he
is
of
her
and
to
my
dear
boy
edward
he
is
the
honestest
young
chap
you
ever
saw
what
he
says
you
may
swear
to
with
your
eyes
shut
but
how
could
they
miss
either
good
looks
or
good
hearts
and
children
the
best
wife
and
the
best
mother
in
england
she
has
been
a
true
consort
to
me
this
many
a
year
and
i
to
her
in
deep
water
and
shoal
let
the
wind
blow
high
or
low
here
is
a
simple
simon
vaunting
his
own
flesh
and
blood
no
wonder
that
little
gentleman
there
is
grinning
at
me
well
grin
away
lad
perhaps
you
have
got
any
children
but
you
have
sir
and
you
know
how
it
is
with
us
fathers
our
hearts
are
so
full
of
the
little
darlings
out
it
must
come
you
can
understand
how
joyful
i
feel
at
saving
their
fortune
from
and
and
landing
it
safe
in
an
honest
man
hands
like
you
and
your
father
before
skinner
handed
him
the
receipt
he
cast
his
eye
over
it
all
right
little
gentleman
now
my
heart
is
relieved
of
such
a
weight
i
feel
to
have
just
cleared
out
a
cargo
of
bricks
shake
hands
i
wish
you
were
as
happy
as
i
am
i
wish
all
the
world
was
happy
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
both
and
with
this
burst
he
was
out
of
the
room
and
making
ardently
for
albion
villa
the
banker
and
his
clerk
turned
round
on
their
seats
and
eyed
one
another
a
long
time
in
silence
and
amazement
was
this
thing
a
dream
their
faces
seemed
to
ask
then
hardie
rested
his
senatorial
head
on
his
hand
and
pondered
deeply
skinner
too
reflected
on
this
strange
freak
of
fortune
and
the
result
was
that
he
burst
in
on
his
reverie
with
a
joyful
shout
the
bank
is
saved
hardie
is
good
for
another
hundred
the
banker
started
for
skinner
voice
sounded
like
a
in
his
ear
so
high
strung
was
he
with
thought
hush
hush
he
said
and
pondered
again
in
silence
at
last
he
turned
to
skinner
you
think
our
course
is
plain
i
tell
you
it
is
so
dark
and
complicated
it
would
puzzle
solomon
to
know
what
is
best
to
be
save
the
bank
sir
whatever
you
how
can
i
save
the
bank
with
a
few
thousand
pounds
which
i
must
refund
when
called
on
you
look
keenly
into
what
is
under
your
eye
skinner
but
you
can
not
see
a
yard
beyond
your
nose
let
me
after
a
while
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
jotted
down
the
materials
as
he
called
them
and
read
them
out
to
his
accomplice
a
bank
too
far
gone
to
be
redeemed
if
i
throw
this
money
into
it
i
shall
ruin
captain
dodd
and
do
myself
no
good
but
only
my
creditors
miss
julia
dodd
virtual
proprietor
of
this
or
of
the
greater
part
if
i
choose
the
child
that
marries
first
usually
jockeys
the
other
alfred
hardie
my
son
and
my
creditor
deep
in
love
with
no
and
at
present
somewhat
alienated
from
me
by
my
thwarting
a
silly
love
affair
which
bids
fair
to
improve
into
a
sound
negotiation
the
paid
to
me
personally
after
banking
hours
and
not
entered
on
the
banking
books
nor
known
but
to
you
and
me
now
suppose
i
treat
this
advance
as
a
personal
trust
the
bank
breaks
the
money
disappears
consternation
of
the
dodds
who
until
enlightened
by
the
public
settlement
will
think
it
has
gone
into
the
well
in
that
interval
i
talk
alfred
over
and
promise
to
produce
the
intact
with
my
paternal
blessing
on
him
and
miss
dodd
provided
he
will
release
me
from
my
debt
to
him
and
give
me
a
life
interest
in
half
the
money
settled
on
him
by
my
wife
father
to
my
most
unjust
and
insolent
exclusion
their
passion
will
soon
bring
the
young
people
to
reason
and
then
they
will
soon
melt
the
old
skinner
was
struck
with
this
masterly
little
sketch
but
he
detected
one
fatal
flaw
you
do
say
what
is
to
become
of
oh
i
have
thought
of
that
but
do
think
of
it
sir
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
it
would
never
do
for
you
and
me
to
be
pulling
two
ways
you
i
will
not
forget
you
said
hardie
wincing
under
the
chain
this
little
wretch
held
him
with
and
had
jerked
him
by
way
of
reminder
but
surely
skinner
you
agree
with
me
it
would
be
a
sin
and
a
shame
to
rob
this
honest
captain
of
his
money
for
my
creditors
curse
them
ah
you
are
not
a
father
how
quickly
he
found
that
out
well
i
am
and
he
touched
me
to
the
quick
i
love
my
little
jane
as
dearly
as
he
loves
his
julia
every
bit
and
i
feel
for
and
then
he
put
me
in
mind
of
my
own
father
poor
man
that
seems
strange
does
it
a
sailor
and
a
banker
ah
it
was
because
they
were
both
honest
men
yes
it
was
like
a
wholesome
flower
coming
into
a
close
room
and
then
out
again
and
heaving
a
whiff
behind
was
that
sailor
he
left
the
savour
of
probity
and
simplicity
behind
though
he
took
the
things
themselves
away
again
why
why
could
he
leave
us
what
is
more
wanted
here
than
even
his
money
his
integrity
the
pearl
of
price
that
my
father
whom
i
used
to
sneer
at
carried
to
his
grave
and
died
simple
but
wise
honest
but
rich
rich
in
money
in
credit
in
honour
and
eternal
hopes
oh
skinner
skinner
i
wish
i
had
never
been
skinner
was
surprised
he
was
not
aware
that
intelligent
men
who
sin
are
subject
to
fits
of
remorse
nay
more
he
was
frightened
for
the
emotion
of
this
iron
man
so
hard
to
move
was
overpowering
when
it
came
it
did
not
soften
it
convulsed
him
do
talk
so
sir
said
the
little
clerk
keep
up
your
heart
have
a
drop
of
you
are
right
said
hardie
gloomily
it
is
idle
to
talk
we
are
all
the
slaves
of
with
this
he
unlocked
a
safe
that
stood
against
the
wall
chucked
the
in
and
shammed
the
iron
door
sharply
and
as
it
closed
upon
the
cash
with
a
clang
the
parlour
door
burst
open
as
if
by
concert
and
david
dodd
stood
on
the
threshold
looking
terrible
his
ruddy
colour
was
all
gone
and
he
seemed
black
and
white
with
anger
and
anxiety
and
out
of
this
blanched
yet
lowering
face
his
eyes
glowed
like
coals
and
roved
keenly
to
and
fro
between
the
banker
and
the
clerk
a
of
a
man
chapter
xvii
james
maxley
came
out
of
the
bank
that
morning
with
nine
hundred
and
four
pounds
buttoned
up
tight
in
the
pocket
of
his
leather
breeches
a
joyful
man
and
so
to
his
work
and
home
at
one
to
dinner
at
he
was
thoughtful
uneasy
at
wretched
at
he
was
gardener
as
well
as
capitalist
and
hardie
owed
him
for
work
such
is
human
nature
in
general
and
maxley
in
particular
that
the
in
pocket
seemed
small
and
the
in
jeopardy
large
i
ca
afford
to
go
with
the
creditors
argued
maxley
dividend
on
why
that
will
be
about
thirty
pence
the
change
for
a
a
in
one
piece
he
stuck
his
spade
in
the
soil
and
made
for
his
debtor
house
as
he
came
up
the
street
dodd
shot
out
of
the
bank
radiant
and
was
about
to
pass
him
without
notice
full
of
his
wife
and
children
but
maxley
stopped
him
with
a
right
cordial
welcome
and
told
him
he
had
given
them
all
a
fright
this
time
what
is
it
over
the
town
already
that
my
ship
has
been
wrecked
and
dodd
looked
annoyed
wrecked
no
but
you
have
been
due
this
two
months
ye
know
wrecked
why
captain
you
have
ever
been
wrecked
and
he
looked
him
all
over
as
if
he
expected
to
see
wrecked
branded
on
him
by
the
elements
ay
james
wrecked
on
the
french
coast
and
lost
my
chronometer
and
a
sextant
but
what
of
that
i
saved
i
have
just
landed
it
in
the
bank
i
must
sheer
off
i
long
to
be
stay
a
bit
captain
said
maxley
i
am
not
quite
easy
in
my
mind
i
saw
you
come
out
of
hardie
i
thought
in
course
you
had
been
in
to
draa
but
you
says
different
now
what
was
it
you
did
leave
behind
you
at
that
there
shop
if
please
not
money
not
money
only
how
the
man
stares
why
it
not
mine
james
it
my
children
there
and
he
was
actually
off
this
time
but
maxley
stretched
his
long
limbs
and
caught
him
in
two
strides
and
griped
his
shoulder
without
ceremony
be
you
mad
said
he
sternly
no
but
i
begin
to
think
you
that
is
to
be
seen
said
maxley
gravely
before
i
lets
you
go
you
must
tell
me
whether
you
be
jesting
or
whether
you
have
really
been
so
simple
as
to
drop
fourteen
thousand
pounds
at
hardie
no
judge
upon
the
bench
nor
bishop
in
his
stall
could
be
more
impressive
than
this
gardener
was
when
he
subdued
the
vast
volume
of
his
voice
to
a
low
grave
utterance
of
this
sort
dodd
began
to
be
uneasy
why
good
heavens
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
old
barkington
bank
nothing
wrong
roared
maxley
then
whispered
holt
i
was
laad
once
for
slander
and
cost
me
thirty
pounds
nearly
killed
my
missus
it
man
cried
dodd
for
my
children
sake
tell
me
if
you
know
anything
amiss
after
all
i
like
a
stranger
here
more
than
two
years
away
at
a
i
tell
you
all
i
know
whispered
maxley
is
the
least
i
can
do
what
roaring
do
you
think
i
forgotten
you
saving
my
poor
boy
out
o
that
scrape
and
getting
him
a
good
place
in
canada
and
why
have
been
put
in
prison
but
for
you
and
that
would
ha
broken
my
heart
and
his
mother
and
the
stout
voice
began
to
quaver
oh
bother
all
that
now
said
dodd
impatiently
the
bank
you
have
grounded
me
on
well
i
tell
ye
but
you
must
promise
faithful
not
to
go
and
say
i
told
ye
or
you
get
me
laad
again
and
i
likes
to
laa
not
for
to
laa
i
promise
i
well
then
i
got
a
letter
from
my
boy
him
as
you
was
so
good
to
and
here
is
in
my
laws
how
things
do
come
round
why
lookee
here
now
if
so
be
had
been
a
good
friend
to
would
be
where
he
is
and
if
so
be
war
where
is
could
have
writ
this
here
and
then
where
should
and
be
belay
your
jaw
and
show
me
this
letter
cried
david
trembling
all
over
that
i
wool
said
maxley
diving
a
hand
into
his
pocket
hush
lookee
yander
now
if
there
ai
master
alfred
of
us
two
out
of
his
window
and
he
have
got
an
eye
like
a
hawk
have
step
in
the
passage
captain
and
i
show
it
to
he
drew
him
aside
into
the
passage
and
gave
him
the
letter
dodd
ran
his
eye
over
it
hastily
uttered
a
cry
like
a
wounded
lion
dropped
it
gave
a
slight
stagger
and
rushed
away
maxley
picked
up
his
letter
and
watched
dodd
into
the
bank
again
and
reflected
on
his
work
his
heart
was
warmed
at
having
made
a
return
to
the
good
captain
his
head
suggested
that
he
was
on
the
road
which
leads
to
libel
but
he
had
picked
up
at
the
assizes
a
smattering
of
the
law
of
evidence
so
he
coolly
tore
the
letter
in
pieces
there
now
said
he
to
himself
if
hardies
do
laa
me
for
publishing
of
this
here
letter
why
they
pours
their
water
into
a
sieve
ugh
and
with
this
exclamation
he
started
and
then
put
his
heavy
boot
on
part
of
the
letter
and
ground
it
furtively
into
the
mud
for
a
light
hand
had
settled
on
his
shoulder
and
a
keen
young
face
was
close
to
his
it
was
alfred
hardie
who
had
stolen
on
him
like
a
cat
i
laad
thought
maxley
maxley
old
fellow
said
alfred
in
a
voice
as
coaxing
as
a
woman
are
you
in
a
good
humour
well
master
halfred
sight
of
you
mostly
puts
me
in
one
especially
after
that
there
strychnine
then
tell
me
whispered
alfred
his
eyes
sparkling
and
his
face
beaming
who
was
that
you
were
talking
to
just
now
was
it
it
who
was
it
chapter
xviii
while
dodd
stood
lowering
in
the
doorway
he
was
nevertheless
making
a
great
effort
to
control
his
agitation
at
last
he
said
in
a
stern
but
low
voice
in
which
however
a
quick
ear
might
detect
a
tremor
of
agitation
i
have
changed
my
mind
sir
i
want
my
money
at
this
though
david
face
had
prepared
him
hardie
heart
sank
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
said
faintly
certainly
may
i
ask
and
there
he
stopped
for
it
was
hardly
prudent
to
ask
anything
no
matter
replied
dodd
his
agitation
rising
even
at
this
slight
delay
come
my
money
i
must
and
will
have
hardie
drew
himself
up
majestically
captain
dodd
this
is
a
strange
way
of
demanding
what
nobody
here
well
i
beg
your
pardon
said
dodd
a
little
awed
by
his
dignity
and
fairness
but
i
ca
help
the
quick
supple
banker
saw
the
slight
advantage
he
had
gained
and
his
mind
went
into
a
whirl
what
should
he
do
it
was
death
to
part
with
this
money
and
gain
nothing
by
it
sooner
tell
dodd
of
the
love
affair
and
open
a
treaty
on
this
basis
he
clung
to
this
money
like
limpet
to
its
rock
and
so
intense
and
rapid
were
his
thoughts
and
schemes
how
to
retain
it
a
little
longer
that
david
apologies
buzzed
in
his
ear
like
the
drone
of
a
beetle
the
latter
went
on
to
say
you
see
sir
it
my
children
fortune
my
boy
edward
and
my
little
julia
and
so
many
have
been
trying
to
get
it
from
me
that
my
blood
boils
up
in
a
moment
about
it
my
poor
head
you
do
seem
to
understand
what
i
am
saying
there
then
i
am
a
sailor
i
ca
go
beating
and
tacking
like
you
landsmen
with
the
wind
dead
astern
the
long
and
the
short
is
i
do
feel
it
safe
here
feel
it
safe
anywhere
except
in
my
wife
lap
so
no
more
words
your
receipt
give
me
my
certainly
captain
dodd
call
morning
at
the
bank
and
it
will
be
paid
on
demand
in
the
regular
way
the
bank
opens
at
ten
no
no
i
ca
wait
i
should
be
dead
of
anxiety
before
then
why
not
pay
it
me
here
and
now
you
took
it
we
receive
deposits
till
four
but
we
do
not
disburse
after
three
this
is
the
system
of
all
that
is
all
nonsense
if
you
are
open
to
receive
money
you
are
open
to
pay
my
dear
sir
if
you
were
not
entirely
ignorant
of
business
you
would
be
aware
that
these
things
are
not
done
in
this
way
money
received
is
passed
to
account
and
the
cashier
is
the
only
person
who
can
honour
your
draft
on
it
but
stop
if
the
cashier
is
in
the
bank
we
may
manage
it
for
you
yet
skinner
run
and
see
whether
he
has
left
and
if
not
send
him
to
me
the
cashier
took
his
cue
and
ran
out
david
was
silent
the
cashier
speedily
returned
saying
with
a
disappointed
air
the
cashier
has
been
gone
this
quarter
of
an
david
maintained
an
ominous
silence
that
is
unfortunate
remarked
hardie
but
after
all
it
is
only
till
morning
still
i
regret
this
circumstance
sir
and
i
feel
that
all
these
precautions
we
are
obliged
to
take
must
seem
unreasonable
to
you
but
experience
dictates
this
severe
routine
and
were
we
to
deviate
from
it
our
friends
money
would
not
be
so
safe
in
our
hands
as
it
always
has
been
at
david
eyed
him
sternly
but
let
him
run
on
when
he
had
concluded
his
flowing
periods
david
said
quietly
so
you
ca
give
me
my
own
because
your
cashier
has
carried
it
away
hardie
smiled
no
no
but
because
he
has
locked
it
up
and
carried
away
the
it
is
not
in
this
room
then
are
you
sure
what
not
in
that
safe
of
yours
there
certainly
not
said
hardie
stoutly
open
the
safe
the
keys
are
in
open
the
safe
what
for
to
show
me
it
is
not
in
the
partition
of
that
safe
there
and
david
pointed
at
the
very
place
where
it
was
the
dignified
hardie
felt
ready
to
sink
with
shame
a
kind
of
shudder
passed
through
him
and
he
was
about
to
comply
but
then
wounded
pride
and
the
rage
of
disappointment
stung
him
and
he
turned
in
defiance
you
are
impertinent
sir
and
i
shall
not
reward
your
curiosity
and
your
insolence
by
showing
you
the
contents
of
my
my
money

money
cried
david
fiercely
no
more
words
for
i
listen
to
them
i
know
you
now
for
what
you
are
a
thief
i
saw
you
put
it
into
that
safe

liar

always
a
thief
you
want
to
steal
my
children
money
i
have
your
life
first
my
money
ye
pirate
or
strangle
and
he
advanced
upon
him
purple
with
rage
and
shot
out
his
long
threatening
arm
and
brown
fingers
working
in
the
air
d
know
what
i
did
to
a
french
that
tried
to
rob
me
of
it
i
throttled
him
with
these
fingers
till
his
eyes
and
his
tongue
started
out
of
him
he
came
for
my
children
money
and
i
killed
him
so
so
so
as
i
kill
you
you
thief
you
liar
you
scoundrel
his
face
black
and
convulsed
with
rage
and
his
outstretched
fingers
working
convulsively
and
hungering
for
a
rogue
throat
made
the
resolute
hardie
quake
he
whipped
out
of
the
furious
man
way
and
got
to
the
safe
pale
and
trembling
hush
no
violence
he
gasped
give
you
your
money
this
moment
you
while
he
unlocked
the
safe
with
trembling
hands
dodd
stood
like
a
man
petrified
his
arm
and
fingers
stretched
out
and
threatening
and
skinner
saw
him
pull
at
his
necktie
furiously
like
one
choking
hardie
got
the
notes
and
bills
all
in
a
hurry
and
held
them
out
to
dodd
in
which
act
to
his
consternation
and
surprise
and
indignation
he
received
a
blow
on
the
eye
that
dazzled
him
for
an
instant
and
there
was
david
with
his
arms
struggling
wildly
and
his
fists
clenched
his
face
purple
and
his
eyes
distorted
so
that
little
was
seen
but
the
whites
the
next
moment
his
teeth
gnashed
loudly
together
and
he
fell
headlong
on
the
floor
with
a
concussion
so
momentous
that
the
windows
rattled
and
the
room
shook
violently
the
dust
rose
in
a
cloud
a
loud
ejaculation
burst
from
hardie
and
skinner
and
then
there
was
an
awful
silence
chapter
xix
when
david
fell
senseless
on
the
floor
hardie
was
somewhat
confused
by
the
blow
from
his
convulsed
and
whirling
arm
but
skinner
ran
to
him
held
up
his
head
and
whipped
off
his
neckcloth
then
hardie
turned
to
seize
the
bell
and
ring
for
assistance
but
skinner
shook
his
head
and
said
it
was
useless
this
was
no
faint
old
betty
could
not
help
him
it
is
a
bad
day
work
sir
said
he
trembling
he
is
a
dead
dead
heaven
forbid
apoplexy
whispered
skinner
run
for
a
doctor
then
lose
no
time
do
let
us
have
his
blood
on
our
hands
dead
and
he
repeated
the
word
this
time
in
a
very
different
tone
a
tone
too
strange
and
significant
to
escape
skinner
quick
ear
however
he
laid
david
head
gently
down
and
rose
from
his
knees
to
obey
what
did
he
see
now
but
hardie
with
his
back
turned
putting
the
notes
and
bills
softly
into
the
safe
again
out
of
sight
he
saw
comprehended
and
took
his
own
course
with
equal
rapidity
come
run
cried
hardie
i
take
care
of
him
every
moment
is
wants
to
get
rid
of
me
thought
skinner
no
sir
said
he
be
ruled
by
me
let
us
take
him
to
his
friends
he
wo
live
and
we
shall
get
all
the
blame
if
we
doctor
already
egotism
had
whispered
hardie
how
lucky
if
he
should
die
and
now
a
still
guiltier
thought
flashed
through
him
he
did
not
try
to
conquer
it
he
only
trembled
at
himself
for
entertaining
it
at
least
give
him
air
said
he
in
a
quavering
voice
consenting
to
a
crime
yet
compromising
with
his
conscience
feebly
he
threw
the
window
open
with
great
zeal
with
prodigious
zeal
for
he
wanted
to
deceive
himself
as
well
as
skinner
with
equal
parade
he
helped
carry
dodd
to
the
window
it
opened
on
the
ground
this
done
the
put
their
heads
together
and
soon
managed
matters
so
that
two
porters
known
to
skinner
were
introduced
into
the
garden
and
informed
that
a
gentleman
had
fallen
down
in
a
fit
and
they
were
to
take
him
home
to
his
friends
and
not
talk
about
it
there
might
be
an
inquest
and
that
was
so
disagreeable
to
a
gentleman
like
hardie
the
men
agreed
at
once
for
a
sovereign
apiece
it
was
all
done
in
a
great
hurry
and
agitation
and
while
skinner
accompanied
the
men
to
see
that
they
did
not
blab
hardie
went
into
the
garden
to
breathe
and
think
but
he
could
do
neither
he
must
have
a
look
at
it
he
stole
back
opened
the
safe
and
examined
the
notes
and
bills
he
fingered
them
they
seemed
to
grow
to
his
finger
he
lusted
after
them
he
said
to
himself
the
matter
has
gone
too
far
to
stop
i
go
on
borrowing
this
money
of
the
dodds
and
make
it
the
basis
of
a
large
fortune
it
will
be
best
for
all
parties
in
the
he
put
it
into
his
that
into
his
and
passed
by
his
private
door
into
the
house
and
to
his
ten
minutes
later
he
left
the
house
with
a
little
black
bag
in
his
band
chapter
xx
what
will
ye
give
me
and
i
tell
ye
said
maxley
to
alfred
hardie
five
that
is
too
five
shillings
that
is
too
little
lookee
here
your
garden
owes
me
thirty
shillings
for
work
suppose

pays
me
and
that
will
save
me
from
going
to
your
dad
for
alfred
consented
readily
and
paid
the
money
then
maxley
told
him
it
was
captain
dodd
he
had
been
talking
with
i
thought
so
i
thought
so
cried
alfred
joyfully
but
i
was
afraid
to
believe
it
it
was
too
delightful
maxley
you
a
trump
you
know
what
anxiety
you
have
relieved
me
of
some
fool
has
gone
and
reported
the
wrecked
look
here
and
he
showed
him
his
lloyd
luckily
it
has
only
just
come
so
i
have
been
miserable
well
to
be
sure
news
flies
fast
he
have
been
wrecked
for
that
he
then
surprised
alfred
by
telling
him
all
he
had
just
learned
from
dodd
and
was
going
to
let
out
about
the
when
he
recollected
this
was
the
banker
son
and
while
he
was
talking
to
him
it
suddenly
struck
maxley
that
this
young
gentleman
would
come
down
in
the
world
should
the
bank
break
and
then
the
dodds
he
concluded
judging
others
by
himself
would
be
apt
to
turn
their
backs
on
him
now
he
liked
alfred
and
was
disposed
to
do
him
a
good
turn
when
he
could
without
hurting
james
maxley
mr
alfred
said
he
i
know
the
world
better
than
you
do
you
be
ruled
by
me
or
you
rue
it
you
put
on
your
sunday
coat
this
minute
and
off
like
a
shot
to
albyn
villee
you
get
there
before
the
captain
he
have
got
a
little
business
to
do
first
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
besides
you
are
young
and
lissom
you
be
the
first
to
tell
missus
dodd
the
good
news
and
when
the
captain
comes
there
sits
you
aside
miss
julee
and
do
you
be
shy
and
shamefaced
take
him
when
his
heart
is
warm
and
tell
him
why
you
are
there
love
her
dear
says
you
he
be
only
a
sailor
and
they
never
has
no
sense
nor
prudence
he
is
sure
to
take
you
by
the
hand
at
such
a
time
and
once
you
get
his
word
he
stand
good
to
his
own
hurt
he
one
of
that
sort
bless
his
silly
old
a
good
deal
of
this
was
unintelligible
to
alfred
but
the
advice
seemed
good
advice
generally
does
when
it
squares
with
our
own
wishes
he
thanked
maxley
left
him
made
a
hasty
toilet
and
ran
to
albion
villa
sarah
opened
the
door
to
him
in
tears
the
news
of
the
wreck
had
come
to
albion
villa
just
half
an
hour
ago
and
in
that
half
hour
they
had
tasted
more
misery
than
hitherto
their
peaceful
lot
had
brought
them
in
years
dodd
was
praying
and
crying
in
her
room
julia
had
put
on
her
bonnet
and
was
descending
in
deep
distress
and
agitation
to
go
down
to
the
quay
and
learn
more
if
possible
alfred
saw
her
on
the
stairs
and
at
sight
of
her
pale
agitated
face
flew
to
her
she
held
out
both
hands
piteously
to
him
o
alfred
good
news
he
panted
he
is
alive
maxley
has
seen
him
i
have
seen
him
he
will
be
here
directly
my
own
love
dry
your
eyes
calm
your
fears
he
is
safe
he
is
well
hurrah
hurrah
the
girl
pale
face
flushed
red
with
hope
then
pale
again
with
emotion
then
rosy
red
with
transcendent
joy
oh
bless
you
bless
you
she
murmured
in
her
sweet
gurgle
so
full
of
heart
then
took
his
head
passionately
with
both
her
hands
as
if
she
was
going
to
kiss
him
uttered
a
little
inarticulate
cry
of
love
and
gratitude
over
him
then
turned
and
flew
up
the
stairs
crying
mamma
mamma
and
burst
into
her
mother
room
when
two
such
impetuosities
meet
as
alfred
and
julia
expect
quick
work
what
happened
in
dodd
room
may
be
imagined
and
soon
both
ladies
came
hastily
out
to
alfred
and
he
found
himself
in
the
seated
between
them
and
holding
a
hand
of
each
and
playing
the
man
delightfully
soothing
and
assuring
them
julia
believed
him
at
a
word
and
beamed
with
unmixed
delight
and
anticipation
of
the
joyful
meeting
dodd
cost
him
more
trouble
her
soft
hand
trembled
still
in
his
and
she
put
question
upon
question
but
when
he
told
her
he
with
his
own
eyes
had
seen
captain
dodd
talking
to
maxley
and
gathered
from
maxley
he
had
been
shipwrecked
on
the
coast
of
france
and
lost
his
chronometer
and
his
sextant
these
details
commanded
credit
bells
were
rung
the
captain
ordered
to
be
got
ready
the
cook
put
on
her
mettle
and
alfred
invited
to
stay
and
dine
with
the
one
and
the
house
of
mourning
became
the
house
of
joy
and
then
it
was
he
who
brought
the
good
news
whispered
julia
to
her
mother
and
that
is
so
yes
dear
said
dodd
he
will
make
even
me
love
him
the
i
hope
that
was
not
lost
in
the
oh
mamma
who
cares
when
his
own
dear
sweet
precious
life
has
been
in
danger
and
is
mercifully
preserved
why
does
he
not
come
i
shall
scold
him
for
keeping
us
waiting
you
know
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
of
him
though
he

i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
govern
him
with
a
rod
of
no
matter
what

let
us
all
three
put
on
our
bonnets
and
run
and
meet
him
i
want

so
to
love

the
very
first
dodd
said
well

a
few
minutes
and
then
if
he
is
not
here
you
two
shall
go
i
dare
hardly
trust
myself
to
meet
my
darling
husband
in
the
open
julia
ran
to
alfred
if
he
does
not
come
in
ten
minutes
you
and
i
may
go
and
meet
you
are
an
angel
murmured
alfred

julia
haughtily

and
i
do

startling
propriety

consequences
if

do
let
off
a
little
little
that

said
dodd
for
i

as
happy
as
you
and
she
played
a
waltz
julia
eyes
were
a
challenge
alfred
started
up
and
took
her
ready
hand
and
soon
the
gay
young
things
were
whirling
round
the
happiest
pair
in
england
but
in
the
middle
of
the
joyous
whirl
julia
quick
ear
on
the
watch
all
the
time
heard
the
gate
swing
to
she
glided
like
an
eel
from
alfred
arm
and
ran
to
the
window
arrived
there
she
made
three
swift
vertical
bounds
like
a
girl
with
a
skipping
rope
only
her
hands
were
clapping
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
then
down
the
stairs
screaming
his
chest
his
chest
he
is
coming
coming
come
alfred
ran
after
her
dodd
unable
to
race
with
such
antelopes
slipped
quietly
out
into
the
little
balcony
julia
had
seen
two
men
carrying
a
trestle
with
a
tarpauling
over
it
and
a
third
walking
beside
dodd
heavy
had
been
more
than
once
carried
home
this
way
she
met
the
men
at
the
door
and
overpowered
them
with
questions
is
it
his
clothes
then
he
was
so
much
wrecked
after
all
is
he
with
you
is
he
coming
directly
why
do
you
tell
me
the
porters
at
first
wore
the
stolid
impassive
faces
of
their
tribe
but
when
this
bright
young
creature
questioned
them
brimming
over
with
ardour
and
joy
their
countenances
fell
and
they
hung
their
heads
the
little
man
who
was
walking
beside
the
others
stepped
forward
to
reply
to
julia
he
was
interrupted
by
a
terrible
scream
from
the
balcony
dodd
was
leaning
wildly
over
it
with
dilating
eyes
and
quivering
hand
that
pointed
down
to
the
other
side
of
the
trestle
julia
julia
julia
ran
round
and
stood
petrified
her
pale
lips
apart
and
all
her
innocent
joy
frozen
in
a
moment
the
tarpauling
was
scanty
there
and
a
man
hand
and
part
of
his
arm
dangled
helpless
out
the
hand
was
blanched
and
wore
a
ring
chapter
xxi
in
the
terror
and
confusion
no
questions
were
then
asked
alfred
got
to
david
head
and
told
skinner
to
take
his
feet
dodd
helped
and
they
carried
him
up
and
laid
him
on
her
bed
the
servant
girls
cried
and
wailed
and
were
of
little
use
dodd
hurried
them
off
for
medical
aid
and
she
and
julia
though
pale
as
ghosts
and
trembling
in
every
limb
were
tearless
and
almost
silent
and
did
all
for
the
best
they
undid
a
shirt
button
that
confined
his
throat
they
set
his
head
high
and
tried
their
poor
little
and
feminine
remedies
and
each
of
them
held
an
insensible
hand
in
both
hers
clasping
it
piteously
and
trying
to
hold
him
tight
so
that
death
should
not
take
him
away
from
them
my
son
where
is
my
son
sighed
dodd
alfred
threw
his
arm
round
her
neck
you
have
one
son
here
what
shall
i
do
the
next
minute
he
was
running
to
the
telegraph
office
for
her
at
the
gate
he
found
skinner
hanging
about
and
asked
him
hurriedly
how
the
calamity
had
happened
skinner
said
captain
dodd
had
fallen
down
senseless
in
the
street
and
he
had
passed
soon
after
recognised
him
and
brought
him
home
i
have
paid
the
men
sir
i
would
let
them
ask
the
ladies
at
such
a
oh
thank
you
thank
you
skinner
i
will
repay
you
it
is
me
you
have
and
alfred
ran
off
with
the
words
in
his
mouth
skinner
looked
after
him
and
muttered
i
forgot
it
is
a
nice
mess
wish
i
was
out
of
and
he
went
back
hanging
his
head
to
alfred
father
osmond
met
him
skinner
turned
and
saw
him
enter
the
villa
osmond
came
softly
into
the
room
examined
dodd
eye
felt
his
pulse
and
said
he
must
be
bled
at
once
dodd
was
averse
to
this
oh
let
us
try
everything
else
first
said
she
but
osmond
told
her
there
was
no
other
remedy
all
the
functions
we
rely
on
in
the
exhibition
of
medicines
are
short
now
drove
up
and
was
ushered
in
dodd
asked
him
imploringly
whether
it
was
necessary
to
bleed
but
short
knew
his
business
too
well
to
be
entrapped
into
an
independent
opinion
where
a
surgeon
had
been
before
him
he
drew
osmond
apart
and
inquired
what
he
had
recommended
this
ascertained
he
turned
to
dodd
and
said
i
advise
venesection
or
oh
short
pray
have
pity
and
order
something
less
terrible
sampson
is
so
averse
to
sampson
sampson
never
heard
of
it
is
the
chronothermal
man
said
osmond
oh
ah
but
this
is
too
serious
a
case
to
be
quacked
coma
with
stertor
and
a
full
bounding
pulse
indicates
liberal
bloodletting
i
would
try
venesection
then
cup
if
necessary
or
leech
the
temple
i
need
not
say
sir
calomel
must
complete
the
cure
the
case
is
simple
and
at
present
surgical
i
leave
it
in
competent
and
he
retired
leaving
the
inferior
practitioner
well
pleased
with
him
and
with
himself
no
insignificant
part
of
a
physicians
art
when
he
was
gone
osmond
told
dodd
that
however
crotchety
sampson
might
be
he
was
an
able
man
and
had
very
properly
resisted
the
indiscriminate
use
of
the
lancet
the
profession
owed
him
much
but
in
apoplexy
the
leech
and
the
lancet
are
still
our
dodd
utter
a
faint
shriek
apoplexy
oh
david
oh
my
darling
have
you
come
home
for
this
osmond
assured
her
apoplexy
was
not
necessarily
fatal
provided
the
cerebral
were
relieved
in
time
by
depletion
the
fixed
eye
and
terrible
stertorous
breathing
on
the
one
hand
and
the
promise
of
relief
on
the
other
overpowered
dodd
reluctance
she
sent
julia
out
of
the
room
on
a
pretext
and
then
consented
with
tears
to
david
being
bled
but
she
would
not
yield
to
leave
the
room
no
this
tender
woman
nerved
herself
to
see
her
husband
blood
flow
sooner
than
risk
his
being
bled
too
much
by
the
hard
hand
of
custom
let
the
peevish
fools
who
make
their
own
troubles
in
love
compare
their
slight
and
merited
pangs
with
this
she
was
his
true
lover
and
his
wife
yet
there
she
stood
with
eye
yet
unflinching
and
saw
the
stab
of
the
little
lancet
and
felt
it
deeper
than
she
would
a
javelin
through
her
own
body
and
watched
the
blood
run
that
was
dearer
to
her
than
her
own
at
the
first
prick
of
the
lancet
david
shivered
and
as
the
blood
escaped
his
eye
unfixed
and
the
pupils
contracted
and
dilated
and
once
he
sighed
good
sign
that
said
osmond
oh
that
is
enough
sir
said
dodd
we
shall
faint
if
you
take
any
osmond
closed
the
vein
observing
that
a
local
bleeding
would
do
the
rest
when
he
had
staunched
the
blood
dodd
sank
half
fainting
in
her
chair
by
some
marvellous
sympathy
it
was
she
who
had
been
bled
and
whose
vein
was
now
closed
osmond
sprinkled
water
on
her
face
she
thanked
him
and
said
sweetly
you
see
i
could
not
have
lost
any
when
it
was
over
she
came
to
tell
julia
she
found
her
sitting
on
the
stairs
crying
and
pale
as
marble
she
suspected
and
there
was
alfred
hanging
over
her
and
in
agony
at
her
grief
out
came
his
love
for
her
in
words
and
accents
unmistakable
and
this
in
osmond
hearing
and
the
maid
oh
hush
hush
cried
poor
dodd
and
her
face
was
seen
to
burn
through
her
tears
and
this
was
the
happy
quiet
little
villa
of
my
opening
chapters
ah
richard
hardie
richard
hardie
the
patient
was
cupped
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
by
osmond
and
on
the
glasses
drawing
showed
signs
of
consciousness
and
the
breathing
was
relieved
these
favourable
symptoms
were
neither
diminished
nor
increased
by
the
subsequent
application
of
the
cupping
needles
we
have
turned
the
said
osmond
cheerfully
rap
rap
rap
came
a
telegraphic
message
from
sampson
and
was
brought
up
to
the
out
visiting
patients
when
yours
came
in
apoplexy
with
a
red
face
and
stertorous
breathing
put
the
feet
in
mustard
bath
and
dash
much
cold
water
on
the
head
from
above
on
revival
give
emetic
cure
with
sulphate
of
quinine
in
apoplexy
with
a
white
face
treat
as
for
a
simple
faint
here
emetic
dangerous
in
neither
apoplexy
bleed
coming
down
by
this
message
added
to
dodd
alarm
the
whole
treatment
varied
so
far
from
what
had
been
done
she
faltered
her
misgivings
osmond
reassured
her
not
bleed
in
apoplexy
said
he
superciliously
why
it
is
the
universal
practice
judge
for
yourself
you
see
the
dodd
admitted
it
then
as
to
the
cold
water
said
osmond
i
would
hardly
advise
so
rough
a
remedy
and
he
is
going
on
so
well
but
you
can
send
for
ice
and
meantime
give
me
a
he
cut
and
fitted
it
adroitly
to
the
patient
head
then
drenched
it
with
and
soon
the
head
began
to
steam
david
muttered
a
few
incoherent
words
and
the
anxious
watchers
thanked
god
aloud
for
them
at
length
osmond
took
leave
with
a
cheerful
countenance
and
left
them
all
grateful
to
him
and
with
a
high
opinion
of
his
judgment
and
skill
especially
julia
she
said
sampson
was
very
amusing
to
talk
to
but
she
should
be
sorry
to
trust
to
that
rash
reckless
boisterous
man
in
time
of
danger
about
two
in
the
morning
a
fly
drove
rapidly
up
to
the
villa
and
sampson
got
out
he
found
david
pale
and
muttering
and
his
wife
and
children
hanging
over
him
in
deep
distress
he
shook
hands
with
them
in
silence
and
eyed
the
patient
keenly
he
took
the
nightcap
off
removed
the
pillows
lowered
his
head
and
said
quietly
this
is
the
cold
fit
come
on
we
must
not
shut
our
eyes
on
the
pashint
why
what
is
this
he
has
been
cupped
and
sampson
changed
colour
and
his
countenance
fell
dodd
saw
and
began
to
tremble
i
could
not
hear
from
you
and
short
and
osmond
felt
quite
sure
and
he
seems
better
oh
sampson
why
were
you
not
here
we
have
bled
him
as
well
oh
do
do
do
say
it
was
wrong
he
would
have
died
they
said
so
oh
david
david
your
wife
has
killed
and
she
knelt
and
kissed
his
hand
and
implored
his
pardon
insensible
julia
clung
sobbing
to
her
mother
in
a
vain
attempt
to
comfort
her
sampson
groaned
no
no
said
he
do
go
on
so
my
poor
soul
you
did
all
for
the
best
and
now
we
must
make
the
best
of
what
is
done
hartshorn
brandy
and
caution
for
those
two
assassins
have
tied
my
while
applying
these
timid
remedies
he
inquired
if
the
cause
was
known
they
told
him
they
knew
nothing
but
that
david
had
been
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
france
and
had
fallen
down
senseless
in
the
street
a
clerk
of
hardie
had
recognised
him
and
brought
him
home
so
alfred
said
then
the
cause
is
mintil
said
sampson
unless
he
got
a
blow
on
the
hid
in
bein
he
then
examined
david
head
carefully
and
found
a
long
scar
but
this
is
not
it
said
he
this
is
dodd
clasped
her
hands
and
assured
him
it
was
new
to
her
her
david
had
no
scar
there
when
he
left
her
last
pursuing
his
examination
sampson
found
an
open
wound
in
his
left
shoulder
he
showed
it
them
and
they
were
all
as
pale
as
the
patient
in
a
moment
he
then
asked
to
see
his
coat
and
soon
discovered
a
corresponding
puncture
in
it
which
he
examined
long
and
narrowly
it
is
a
stab
with
a
there
was
a
simultaneous
cry
of
horror
do
alarm
yourselves
for
that
said
sampson
it
is
nothing
a
mere
it
is
the
that
alarms
me
this
school
knows
nothing
about
the
paroxysms
and
remissions
of
disease
they
have
bled
and
cupped
him
for
a
it
has
passed
into
the
cold
stage
but
no
quicker
than
it
would
have
done
without
stealing
a
drop
of
blood
by
disease
nature
he
will
have
another
hot
fit
in
spite
of
their
bleeding
then
those
ijjits
would
leech
his
temples
and
on
that
paroxysm
remitting
by
the
nature
of
the
disease
would
fancy
their
leeches
had
cured
the
words
were
the
old
words
but
the
tone
and
manner
was
so
different
no
shouting
no
anger
all
was
spoken
low
and
gently
and
with
a
sort
of
sad
and
weary
and
air
he
ordered
a
kettle
of
hot
water
and
a
quantity
of
mustard
and
made
his
preparations
for
the
hot
fit
as
he
called
it
maintaining
the
intermittent
and
febrile
character
of
all
disease
the
patient
rambled
a
good
deal
but
quite
incoherently
and
knew
nobody
but
about
eight
in
the
morning
he
was
quite
quiet
and
apparently
sleeping
so
dodd
stole
out
of
the
room
to
order
some
coffee
for
sampson
and
edward
they
were
nodding
worn
out
with
watching
julia
whose
nature
could
dispense
with
sleep
on
such
an
occasion
was
on
her
knees
praying
for
her
father
suddenly
there
came
from
the
bed
like
a
two
words
uttered
loud
and
furiously
hardie
villain
up
started
the
drowsy
watchers
and
rubbed
their
eyes
they
had
heard
the
sound
but
not
the
sense
julia
rose
from
her
knees
bewildered
and
aghast
she
had
caught
the
strange
words
distinctly
words
that
were
to
haunt
her
night
and
day
they
were
followed
immediately
by
a
loud
groan
and
the
stertorous
breathing
recommenced
and
the
face
was
no
longer
pale
but
flushed
and
turgid
on
this
sampson
hurried
julia
from
the
room
and
with
help
placed
david
on
a
stool
in
the
bath
and
getting
on
a
chair
discharged
half
a
bucket
of
cold
water
on
his
head
the
patient
gasped
another
and
david
shuddered
stared
wildly
and
put
his
hand
to
his
head
a
third
and
he
staggered
to
his
feet
at
this
moment
dodd
coming
hastily
into
the
room
he
looked
steadily
at
her
and
said
lucy
she
ran
to
throw
her
arms
round
him
but
sampson
interfered
gently
gently
said
he
we
must
have
no
violent
oh
no
i
will
be
and
she
stood
quiet
with
her
arms
still
extended
and
cried
for
joy
they
got
david
to
bed
again
anti
sampson
told
dodd
there
was
no
danger
now
from
the
malady
but
only
from
the
remedies
and
in
fact
david
fell
into
a
state
of
weakness
and
exhaustion
and
kept
muttering
unintelligibly
short
called
in
the
morning
and
was
invited
to
consult
with
sampson
he
declined
dr
sampson
is
a
notorious
quack
no
physician
of
any
eminence
will
meet
him
in
i
regret
that
resolution
said
dodd
quietly
as
it
will
deprive
me
of
the
advantage
of
your
short
bowed
stifly
i
shall
be
at
your
service
madam
when
that
empiric
has
given
the
patient
and
he
drove
away
osmond
finding
sampson
installed
took
the
politic
line
he
contrived
to
glide
by
fine
gradations
into
the
empiric
opinions
without
recanting
his
own
which
were
diametrically
opposed
sampson
before
he
shot
back
to
town
asked
him
to
provide
a
good
reliable
nurse
he
sent
a
young
woman
of
iron
she
received
sampson
instructions
and
assumed
the
command
of
the
and
was
jealous
of
dodd
and
julia
looked
on
them
as
mere
rival
nurses
amateurs
who
if
not
snubbed
might
ruin
the
professionals
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
in
the
hospitals
all
about
the
family
affections
and
their
power
of
turning
invalids
themselves
into
nurses
the
second
night
she
got
the
patient
all
to
herself
for
four
hours
from
eleven
till
two
the
ladies
having
consented
to
this
arrangement
its
order
to
recruit
themselves
for
the
work
they
were
not
so
mad
as
to
intrust
wholly
to
a
hireling
nurse
feathers
smoothed
themselves
perceptibly
at
twelve
the
patient
was
muttering
and
murmuring
incessantly
about
wrecks
and
money
and
things
of
which
vain
babble
nurse
showed
her
professional
contempt
by
nodding
at
she
slept
at
she
snored
very
loud
and
woke
instantly
at
the
sound
she
took
the
thief
out
of
the
candle
and
went
like
a
good
sentinel
to
look
at
her
charge
he
was
not
there
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
held
the
candle
over
the
place
where
he
ought
to
be
where
in
fact
he
must
be
for
he
was
far
too
weak
to
move
she
tore
the
bedclothes
down
she
beat
and
patted
the
clothes
with
her
left
hand
and
the
candle
began
to
shake
violently
in
her
right
the
bed
was
empty
dodd
was
half
asleep
when
a
hurried
tap
came
to
her
door
she
started
up
in
a
moment
and
great
dread
fell
on
her
was
david
sinking
is
he
here
he
who
cried
dodd
bewildered
why
he
ca
be
far
off
in
a
moment
dodd
had
opened
the
door
and
her
tongue
and
the
nurse
seemed
to
dash
together
so
fast
came
the
agitated
words
from
each
in
turn
and
crying
call
my
son
alarm
the
house
dodd
darted
into
the
sickroom
she
was
out
again
in
a
moment
and
up
in
the
attics
rousing
the
maids
while
the
nurse
thundered
at
edward
door
and
julia
and
rang
every
bell
she
could
get
at
the
inmates
were
soon
alarmed
and
flinging
on
their
clothes
meantime
dodd
and
the
nurse
scoured
the
house
and
searched
every
nook
in
it
down
to
the
very
cellar
they
found
no
david
but
they
found
something
the
street
door
ajar
it
was
a
dark
drizzly
night
edward
took
one
road
dodd
and
elizabeth
another
they
were
no
sooner
gone
than
julia
drew
the
nurse
into
a
room
apart
and
asked
her
eagerly
if
her
father
had
said
nothing
said
nothing
miss
why
he
was
all
the
night
did
he
say
anything
particular
think
no
miss
he
went
on
as
they
all
do
just
before
a
change
i
never
minds
i
hear
so
much
of
oh
nurse
nurse
have
pity
on
me
try
and
well
miss
to
oblige
you
then
it
was
mostly
fights
this
time
and
wrecks
and
villains
and
bankers
and
bankers
asked
julia
eagerly
yes
miss
and
villains
they
come
once
or
twice
but
most
of
the
time
it
was
sharks
and
ships
and
money
and
i
call
it
the
way
they
talk
bless
your
heart
they
know
no
better
everything
they
ever
saw
or
read
or
heard
tell
of
it
all
comes
out
just
before
they
goes
off
we
that
makes
it
a
business
never
takes
no
notice
of
what
they
says
miss
and
never
repeats
it
out
of
one
sick
house
into
another
that
you
rely
julia
scarcely
heard
this
her
hands
were
tight
to
her
brow
as
if
to
aid
her
to
think
with
all
her
force
the
result
was
she
told
sarah
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
rushed
upstairs
she
was
not
gone
three
minutes
but
in
that
short
interval
the
tongue
and
sarah
clashed
together
swiftly
and
incessantly
julia
heard
them
she
came
down
with
a
long
cloak
on
whipped
the
hood
over
her
head
beckoned
sarah
quickly
and
darted
out
sarah
followed
instinctively
but
ere
they
had
gone
many
yards
from
the
house
said
oh
miss
nurse
thinks
you
had
much
better
not
nurse
thinks
nurse
thinks
what
does
she
know
of
me
and
my
griefs
why
miss
she
is
a
very
experienced
woman
and
she
says
oh
dear
oh
dear
and
such
a
dark
cold
night
for
you
to
be
out
nurse
nurse
what
did
she
say
oh
i
have
the
heart
to
tell
you
if
you
would
but
come
back
home
with
me
she
says
as
much
as
that
poor
master
troubles
will
be
over
long
before
we
can
get
to
and
with
this
sarah
burst
out
sobbing
come
quicker
cried
julia
despairingly
but
after
a
while
she
said
tell
me
only
do
stop
miss
she
says
she
nursed
campbell
the
young
curate
that
died
last
but
one
you
know
and
he
lay
just
like
master
and
she
expecting
a
change
every
hour
and
oh
miss
she
met
him
coming
in
his
nightgown
and
he
said
i
am
all
right
now
says
he
and
died
momently
in
her
arms
at
the
and
she
nursed
an
old
farmer
that
lay
as
weak
as
master
and
just
when
they
looked
for
him
to
go
lo
and
behold
him
dressed
and
out
digging
potatoes
and
fell
down
dead
before
they
could
get
hands
on
him
mostly
and
nurse
have
a
friend
that
have
seen
more
than
she
have
which
she
is
older
than
nurse
and
says
a
body
life
is
all
one
as
a
rushlight
flares
up
strong
momently
just
before
it
goes
out
altogether
dear
heart
where
ever
are
we
going
to
in
the
middle
of
the
night
do
you
see
to
the
oh
do
go
there
miss
whatever
i
ca
abide
the
sight
of
the
water
when
a
body
in
here
a
drunken
man
confronted
them
and
asked
then
if
they
wanted
a
beau
and
on
their
slipping
past
him
in
silence
followed
them
and
offered
repeatedly
to
treat
them
julia
moaned
and
hurried
faster
oh
miss
said
sarah
what
could
you
expect
coming
out
at
this
time
of
night
i
sure
the
breath
is
all
out
of
me
you
do
tear
along
tear
we
are
crawling
ah
sarah
you
are
not
his
daughter
there
follow
me
i
can
not
go
so
and
she
set
off
to
run
presently
she
passed
a
group
of
women
standing
talking
at
a
corner
of
the
street
and
windows
were
open
with
nightcapped
heads
framed
in
them
she
stopped
a
moment
to
catch
the
words
they
were
talking
about
a
ghost
which
was
said
to
have
just
passed
down
the
street
and
discussing
whether
it
was
a
real
ghost
or
a
trick
to
frighten
people
julia
uttered
a
low
cry
and
redoubled
her
speed
and
was
soon
at
richard
hardie
door
but
the
street
was
deserted
and
she
was
bewildered
and
began
to
think
she
had
been
too
hasty
in
her
conjecture
a
chill
came
over
her
impetuosity
the
dark
drizzly
silent
night
the
tall
masts
the
smell
of
the
river
how
strange
it
all
seemed
and
she
to
be
there
alone
at
such
an
hour
presently
she
heard
voices
somewhere
near
she
crossed
over
to
a
passage
that
seemed
to
lead
towards
them
and
then
she
heard
the
voices
plainly
and
among
them
one
that
did
not
mingle
with
the
others
for
it
was
the
voice
she
loved
she
started
back
and
stood
irresolute
would
he
be
displeased
with
her
feet
came
trampling
slowly
along
the
passage
his
voice
came
with
them
she
drew
back
and
looked
round
for
sarah
while
she
stood
fluttering
the
footsteps
came
close
and
there
emerged
from
the
passage
into
the
full
light
of
the
alfred
and
two
policemen
carrying
a
silent
senseless
figure
in
a
with
a
thrown
over
part
of
him
it
was
her
father
mute
and
ghastly
the
policemen
still
tell
of
that
strange
meeting
under
the
gaslight
by
hardie
bank
and
how
the
young
lady
flung
her
arms
round
her
head
and
took
him
for
death
and
kissed
his
pale
cheeks
and
moaned
over
him
and
how
the
young
gentleman
raised
her
against
her
will
and
sobbed
over
her
and
how
they
though
policemen
cried
like
children
and
to
them
i
must
refer
the
reader
i
have
not
the
skill
to
convey
the
situation
they
got
more
policemen
to
help
and
carried
him
to
albion
villa
on
the
way
something
cold
and
mysterious
seemed
to
have
come
between
julia
and
alfred
they
walked
apart
in
gloomy
silence
broken
only
by
foreboding
sighs
i
pass
over
the
tempest
of
emotions
under
which
that
sad
burden
entered
albion
villa
and
hurry
to
the
next
marked
event
next
day
the
patient
had
lost
his
extreme
pallor
and
wore
a
certain
uniform
sallow
hue
and
at
noon
just
before
sampson
return
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
fixed
them
on
dodd
and
julia
who
were
now
his
nurses
they
hailed
this
with
delight
and
held
their
breath
to
hear
him
speak
to
them
the
first
sweet
words
of
reviving
life
and
love
but
soon
to
their
surprise
and
grief
they
found
he
did
not
know
them
they
spoke
to
him
each
in
turn
and
told
him
piteously
who
they
were
and
implored
him
with
tears
to
know
them
and
speak
to
them
but
no
he
fixed
a
stony
gaze
on
them
that
made
them
shudder
and
their
beloved
voices
passed
over
him
like
an
idle
wind
sampson
when
he
came
found
the
ladies
weeping
by
the
bedside
they
greeted
him
with
affection
julia
especially
the
boisterous
controversialist
had
come
out
a
gentle
zealous
artist
in
presence
of
a
real
danger
sampson
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
in
his
absence
he
stepped
to
the
bedside
cheerfully
and
the
ladies
eyes
were
bent
keenly
on
his
face
in
silence
he
had
no
sooner
cast
eyes
on
david
than
his
countenance
fell
and
his
hard
but
expressive
features
filled
with
concern
that
was
enough
for
dodd
and
he
does
not
know
me
she
cried
he
does
not
know
my
voice
voice
would
call
me
back
from
the
grave
itself
he
is
dying
he
will
never
speak
to
me
again
oh
my
poor
orphan
girl
no
no
said
samson
you
are
quite
mistaken
he
will
not
die
but
his
tongue
said
no
more
his
grave
and
sombre
face
spoke
volumes
chapter
xxii
to
return
to
the
bank
skinner
came
back
from
the
dodds
that
miserable
afternoon
in
a
state
of
genuine
agitation
and
regret
he
was
human
and
therefore
mixed
and
their
desolation
had
shocked
him
the
footman
told
him
hardie
was
not
at
home
gone
to
london
he
believed
skinner
walked
away
dejected
what
did
this
mean
had
he
left
the
country
he
smiled
at
his
fears
and
felt
positive
hardie
had
misled
the
servants
and
was
quietly
waiting
for
him
in
the
bank
parlour
it
was
now
dusk
he
went
round
to
that
little
dark
nook
of
the
garden
the
parlour
window
opened
on
and
tapped
there
was
no
reply
the
room
looked
empty
he
tried
the
sash
it
yielded
hardie
had
been
too
occupied
with
embezzling
another
property
to
take
common
precautions
in
defence
of
his
own
never
in
his
life
before
had
he
neglected
to
fasten
the
iron
shutters
with
his
own
hand
and
he
had
left
the
very
window
unfastened
this
augured
he
is
off
he
has
done
me
along
with
the
rest
thought
skinner
he
stepped
into
the
room
found
a
shut
the
shutters
lighted
a
candle
and
went
peering
about
amongst
the
banker
papers
to
see
if
he
could
find
a
clue
to
his
intentions
and
as
he
pottered
and
peered
he
quaked
as
well
a
detector
by
dishonest
means
feels
and
is
what
he
feels
he
made
some
little
discoveries
that
guided
him
in
his
own
conduct
he
felt
more
and
more
sure
his
employer
would
outwit
him
if
he
could
and
resolved
it
should
be
diamond
cut
diamond
the
church
clock
struck
one
he
started
at
the
hour
crept
out
and
closed
the
window
softly
then
away
by
the
garden
gate
a
light
was
still
burning
in
alfred
room
and
at
this
skinner
had
another
touch
of
compunction
there
is
one
wo
sleep
this
night
along
of
our
work
thought
he
at
three
next
afternoon
hardie
reappeared
he
had
gone
up
to
town
to
change
the
form
of
the
deposit
he
took
care
to
think
of
it
as
a
deposit
still
the
act
of
deposit
having
been
complete
the
withdrawal
incomplete
and
by
no
fault
of
his
for
he
had
offered
it
back
but
fate
and
accident
had
interposed
he
had
converted
the
notes
into
gold
direct
and
the
bills
into
gold
through
notes
this
was
like
going
into
the
river
to
hide
his
trail
next
process
he
turned
his
gold
into
notes
and
came
flying
home
with
them
his
return
was
greeted
by
skinner
with
a
sigh
of
relief
hardie
heard
it
interpreted
it
aright
and
sent
for
him
into
the
parlour
and
there
told
him
with
a
great
affectation
of
frankness
what
he
had
done
then
asked
significantly
if
there
was
any
news
at
albion
villa
skinnier
in
reply
told
hardie
of
the
distress
he
had
witnessed
up
at
albion
villa
and
sir
said
he
lowering
his
voice
mr
alfred
helped
carry
the
body
upstairs
it
is
a
nice
mess
altogether
sir
when
you
come
to
ah
all
the
better
was
the
cool
reply
he
will
be
useful
to
let
us
know
what
we
want
he
will
tell
jane
and
jane
me
you
do
think
he
will
live
do
you
live
no
and
then
who
will
know
the
money
is
here
who
should
know
did
not
he
say
he
had
just
landed
and
been
shipwrecked
shipwrecked
men
do
not
bring
fourteen
thousand
pounds
the
speaker
eyes
sparkled
skinner
watched
him
demurely
skinner
said
he
solemnly
i
believe
my
daughter
jane
is
right
and
that
providence
really
interferes
sometimes
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
you
know
how
i
have
struggled
to
save
my
family
from
disgrace
and
poverty
those
struggles
have
failed
in
a
great
degree
but
heaven
has
seen
them
and
saved
this
money
from
the
sea
and
dropped
it
into
my
very
hands
to
retrieve
my
fortunes
with
i
must
be
grateful
spend
a
portion
of
it
in
charity
and
rear
a
noble
fortune
on
the
rest
confound
it
all
and
his
crestfallen
countenance
showed
some
ugly
misgiving
had
flashed
on
him
quite
suddenly
what
sir
what
asked
skinner
eagerly
the
receipt
chapter
xxiii
the
receipt
oh
is
that
all
have
got
that
said
skinner
very
coolly
what
makes
you
think
so
inquired
the
other
keenly
he
instantly
suspected
skinner
of
having
it
why
sir
i
saw
it
in
his
then
it
has
got
to
albion
villa
and
we
are
no
no
sir
you
wo
hear
me
i
am
sure
i
saw
it
fall
out
of
his
hand
when
he
was
taken
ill
and
i
think
but
i
wo
be
sure
he
fell
on
it
anyway
there
was
nothing
in
his
hands
when
i
delivered
him
at
albion
villa
so
it
must
be
here
i
daresay
you
have
thrown
it
into
a
drawer
or
somewhere
no
no
skinner
said
hardie
with
increasing
alarm
it
is
useless
for
us
to
deceive
ourselves
i
was
not
three
minutes
in
the
room
and
thought
of
nothing
but
getting
to
town
and
cashing
the
he
rang
the
bell
sharply
and
on
betty
coming
in
asked
her
what
she
had
done
with
that
paper
that
was
on
the
floor
took
it
up
and
put
it
on
the
table
sir
this
was
it
i
and
she
had
her
finger
upon
a
paper
no
no
said
hardie
the
one
i
mean
was
much
smaller
than
what
said
she
with
that
astonishing
memory
for
trifles
people
have
who
never
read
was
it
a
little
crumpled
up
paper
lying
by
the
basket
yes
yes
that
sounds
like
oh
i
put
that
the
hardie
eye
fell
directly
on
the
basket
but
it
was
empty
she
caught
his
glance
and
told
him
she
had
emptied
it
in
the
as
usual
hardie
uttered
an
angry
exclamation
betty
an
old
servant
of
his
wife
resented
it
with
due
dignity
by
tossing
her
head
as
she
retired
there
is
no
help
for
it
said
hardie
bitterly
we
must
go
and
grub
in
the
why
sir
your
name
is
not
on
it
after
what
does
that
matter
a
man
is
bound
by
the
act
of
his
agent
besides
it
is
my
form
and
my
initials
on
the
back
come
let
us
put
a
good
face
on
the
and
he
led
the
way
to
the
kitchen
and
got
up
a
little
laugh
and
asked
the
if
she
could
show
skinner
and
him
the
she
stared
but
obeyed
and
the
pair
followed
her
making
merry
the
was
empty
the
girl
explained
it
is
the
dustman
day
he
came
at
eleven
in
the
morning
and
carried
all
the
dust
away
and
grumbled
at
the
paper
and
the
bones
he
did
so
i
told
him
beggars
mus
be
choosers
just
like
his
impudence
when
he
gets
it
for
nothing
and
sells
it
for
a
mint
outside
the
the
unwonted
visitors
left
her
in
dead
silence
almost
before
she
had
finished
her
sentence
hardie
sat
down
in
his
parlour
thoroughly
discomposed
skinner
watched
him
furtively
at
last
the
former
broke
out
this
is
the
devil
doing
the
devil
in
person
no
intelligence
nor
ability
can
resist
such
luck
i
almost
wish
we
had
never
meddled
with
it
we
shall
never
feel
safe
never
be
skinner
made
light
of
the
matter
treated
the
receipt
as
thrown
into
the
sea
why
sir
said
he
by
this
time
it
will
have
found
its
way
to
that
monstrous
heap
of
ashes
on
the
london
road
and
who
will
ever
look
for
it
there
or
notice
it
if
they
find
it
hardie
shook
his
head
that
monstrous
heap
is
all
sold
every
year
to
the
farmers
that
receipt
worth
to
me
will
be
strewed
on
the
soil
for
manure
then
some
farmer
man
or
some
farmer
boy
that
goes
to
the
will
read
it
see
captain
dodd
name
and
bring
it
to
albion
villa
in
hopes
of
a
sixpence
a
sixpence
heaven
help
the
man
who
does
a
doubtful
act
and
leaves
damnatory
evidence
on
paper
kicking
about
the
from
that
hour
the
cash
hardie
carried
in
his
bosom
without
a
right
to
it
began
to
blister
he
thought
of
telling
the
dustman
he
had
lost
a
paper
and
setting
him
to
examine
the
mountain
of
ashes
on
the
london
road
but
here
caution
stepped
in
how
could
he
describe
the
paper
without
awakening
curiosity
and
defeating
his
own
end
he
gave
that
up
it
was
better
to
let
the
sleeping
dog
lie
finally
he
resolved
to
buy
security
in
a
world
where
after
all
one
has
to
buy
everything
so
he
employed
an
adroit
agent
and
quietly
purchased
that
mountain
the
refuse
of
all
barkington
but
he
felt
so
he
paid
for
it
in
his
own
notes
by
this
means
the
treaty
reverted
to
the
primitive
form
of
ashes
for
rags
or
exchange
of
commodities
without
the
aid
of
money
see
homer
and
welsh
villages
this
transaction
he
concealed
from
his
confederate
when
he
had
completed
it
he
was
not
yet
secure
for
another
day
had
passed
and
captain
dodd
alive
still
men
often
recover
from
apoplexy
especially
when
they
survive
the
first
hours
should
he
live
he
would
not
now
come
into
any
friendly
arrangement
with
the
man
who
had
so
nearly
caused
his
death
so
then
to
the
matrimonial
combination
hardie
had
at
first
relied
on
to
patch
his
debt
to
alfred
and
his
broken
fortunes
then
as
to
keeping
the
money
and
defying
dodd
that
would
be
very
difficult
and
dangerous
mercantile
bills
are
traceable
things
and
criminal
prosecutions
awkward
ones
he
found
himself
in
a
situation
he
could
not
see
his
way
through
by
any
mental
effort
there
were
so
many
objections
to
every
course
and
so
many
to
its
opposite
he
walked
among
fires
as
the
latins
say
but
the
more
he
pondered
on
the
course
to
be
taken
should
dodd
live
the
plainer
did
this
dilemma
stare
him
in
the
fade
either
he
must
refund
or
fly
the
country
with
another
man
money
and
leave
behind
him
the
name
of
a
thief
parental
love
and
the
remains
of
writhed
at
this
thought
and
with
these
combined
a
sentiment
less
genuine
but
by
no
means
feeble
the
love
of
reputation
so
it
was
with
a
reluctant
and
sick
heart
he
went
to
the
shipping
office
and
peered
at
the
posters
to
see
when
the
next
ship
sailed
for
the
united
states
still
he
did
go
intent
on
his
own
schemes
and
expecting
every
day
to
be
struck
in
front
he
did
not
observe
that
a
man
in
a
rusty
velveteen
coat
followed
him
and
observed
this
act
and
indeed
all
his
visible
acts
another
perplexity
was
when
he
should
break
there
were
objections
to
doing
it
immediately
and
objections
to
putting
it
off
with
all
this
the
man
was
in
a
ferment
by
day
he
sat
waiting
and
fearing
by
night
he
lay
sleepless
and
thinking
and
though
his
stoical
countenance
retained
its
composure
the
furrows
deepened
in
it
and
the
iron
nerves
began
to
twitch
at
times
from
strain
of
mind
and
want
of
sleep
and
that
rack
suspense
not
a
night
that
he
did
not
awaken
a
dozen
times
from
his
brief
dozes
with
a
start
and
a
dread
of
exposure
by
some
mysterious
unforeseen
means
it
is
remarkable
how
truths
sometimes
flash
on
men
at
night
in
hours
of
nervous
excitement
it
was
in
one
of
these
nightly
reveries
david
flashed
back
upon
hardie
he
saw
it
before
his
eyes
quite
plain
and
on
the
inside
of
the
leather
cover
a
slip
of
paper
pasted
and
written
on
in
pencil
or
pale
ink
he
could
not
recall
which
what
was
that
writing
it
might
be
the
numbers
of
the
notes
the
description
of
the
bills
why
had
he
not
taken
it
out
of
the
dying
pocket
fool
fool
he
groaned
to
do
anything
by
another
night
he
got
a
far
severer
shock
lying
in
his
bed
dozing
and
muttering
as
usual
he
was
suddenly
startled
out
of
that
uneasy
slumber
by
three
tremendous
knocks
at
the
street
door
he
sprang
out
of
bed
and
in
his
confusion
made
sure
the
officers
of
justice
were
come
for
him
he
began
to
huddle
on
his
clothes
with
a
vague
notion
of
flight
he
had
got
on
his
trousers
and
slippers
and
was
looking
under
his
pillow
for
the
fatal
cash
when
he
heard
himself
called
loudly
and
repeatedly
by
name
but
this
time
the
sound
came
from
the
garden
into
which
his
bedroom
looked
he
opened
it
very
softly
in
trepidation
and
wonder
which
were
speedily
doubled
by
what
met
his
eyes
for
there
right
in
front
of
his
window
stood
an
unearthly
figure
corresponding
in
every
particular
to
that
notion
of
a
ghost
in
which
we
are
reared
and
which
when
our
nerves
are
healthy
we
can
ridicule
as
it
deserves
but
somehow
it
is
never
cleaned
out
of
our
imagination
so
thoroughly
as
it
is
out
of
our
judgment
the
figure
was
white
as
a
sheet
and
seemed
supernaturally
tall
and
it
cried
out
in
a
voice
like
a
wounded
lion
you
villain
you
hardie
give
me
back
my
money
my
fourteen
thousand
pounds
give
me
my
children
money
or
may
your
children
die
before
your
eyes
give
me
my
darlings
money
or
may
the
eternal
curse
of
god
light
on
you
and
yours
you
scoundrel
and
the
figure
kneeled
on
the
grass
and
repeated
the
terrible
imprecation
almost
in
the
same
words
with
such
energy
that
hardie
shrank
back
and
resolute
as
he
was
cowered
with
superstitious
awe
but
this
sentiment
soon
gave
way
to
vulgar
fears
the
man
would
alarm
the
town
and
in
fact
hardie
in
the
midst
of
his
agitation
was
dimly
conscious
of
hearing
a
window
open
softly
not
very
far
from
him
but
it
was
a
dark
night
he
put
his
head
out
in
great
agitation
and
whispered
hush
hush
i
bring
it
you
down
internally
cursing
his
hard
fate
he
got
the
fatal
cash
put
on
his
coat
hunted
for
the
key
of
the
bank
parlour
and
having
found
it
went
softly
down
the
stairs
unlocked
the
door
and
went
to
open
the
shutters
at
this
moment
his
ear
caught
a
murmur
a
low
buzzing
of
voices
in
the
garden
he
naturally
thought
that
captain
dodd
was
exposing
him
to
some
of
the
townspeople
he
was
puzzled
what
to
do
and
like
a
cautious
man
as
he
was
remained
passive
but
on
the
watch
presently
the
voices
were
quiet
and
he
heard
footsteps
come
very
slowly
towards
the
window
at
which
he
stood
and
then
make
for
the
little
gate
on
this
he
slipped
into
the
kitchen
which
faced
the
street
and
got
to
a
window
there
and
listened
his
only
idea
was
to
catch
their
intentions
if
possible
and
meet
them
accordingly
he
dared
not
open
the
window
for
about
him
on
the
pavement
he
saw
a
female
figure
half
standing
half
crouching
but
soon
that
figure
rushed
wildly
out
of
his
sight
to
meet
the
footsteps
and
then
he
ventured
to
open
the
window
and
listening
heard
cries
of
despair
and
a
young
voice
say
her
father
was
dead
ah
that
is
all
right
muttered
hardie
still
even
this
profound
egotist
was
not
yet
so
hardened
but
that
he
felt
one
chill
of
horror
at
himself
for
the
thought
a
passing
chill
he
listened
and
listened
and
he
heard
the
slow
feet
recommence
their
journey
amidst
sobs
and
sights
and
those
sorrowful
feet
and
the
sobs
and
sighs
of
his
causing
got
fainter
and
fainter
retreated
and
left
him
in
quiet
possession
of
the
he
had
brought
down
to
give
it
up
two
minutes
ago
it
was
not
worth
as
many
pence
to
him
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
it
is
mine
i
am
to
keep
it
it
is
the
will
of
poor
heaven
he
went
to
his
bed
again
and
by
a
resolute
effort
composed
himself
and
determined
to
sheep
and
in
fact
he
was
just
dropping
off
when
suddenly
he
started
wide
awake
again
for
it
recurred
to
him
vividly
that
a
window
in
his
house
had
opened
while
david
was
cursing
him
and
demanding
his
children
money
whose
window
people
and
more
slept
on
that
side
of
the
house
whose
window
could
it
be
he
walked
among
fires
chapter
xxiv
not
many
days
after
this
a
crowd
of
persons
stood
in
front
of
the
old
bank
looking
half
stupefied
at
the
shutters
and
at
a
piece
of
paper
pasted
on
them
announcing
a
suspension
only
for
a
months
or
so
and
laying
the
blame
on
certain
correspondents
not
specified
so
great
was
the
confidence
inspired
by
the
old
bank
that
many
said
it
would
come
round
it
must
come
round
in
a
month
but
other
of
hardie
unfortunate
clients
recognised
in
the
above
a
mere
formula
to
let
them
down
by
degrees
they
had
seen
many
statements
as
hopeful
end
in
a
dividend
of
sixpence
in
the
pound
before
the
day
closed
the
scene
at
the
bank
door
was
respectable
persons
reduced
to
pauperism
in
that
day
kept
arriving
and
telling
their
their
little
all
was
with
hardie
and
nothing
before
them
but
the
workhouse
or
the
almshouse
ruined
mothers
came
and
held
up
their
ruined
children
for
the
banker
to
see
and
the
doors
were
hammered
at
and
the
house
as
well
as
the
bank
was
beleaguered
by
a
weeping
wailing
despairing
crowd
but
like
an
idle
wave
beating
on
a
rock
all
this
human
misery
dashed
itself
in
vain
against
the
banker
brick
walls
and
shutters
hard
to
them
as
his
very
heart
the
next
day
they
mobbed
alfred
and
hissed
him
at
the
jane
was
too
ashamed
and
too
frightened
to
stir
out
hardie
sat
calmly
putting
the
finishing
strokes
to
his
fabricated
some
innocent
and
excited
victims
went
to
the
mayor
for
redress
to
the
aldermen
the
magistrates
in
vain
towards
afternoon
the
banker
cool
contempt
for
his
benefactors
whose
lives
he
had
darkened
received
a
temporary
check
a
heavy
stone
was
flung
at
the
bank
shutters
this
ferocious
blow
made
him
start
and
the
place
rattle
it
was
the
signal
for
a
shower
and
presently
tink
tink
went
the
windows
of
the
house
and
in
came
the
stones
starring
the
mirrors
upsetting
the
chairs
denting
the
papered
walls
chipping
the
mantelpieces
shivering
the
bell
glasses
and
statuettes
and
strewing
the
room
with
dirty
pebbles
and
painted
fragments
and
glittering
ruin
hardie
winced
this
was
the
sort
of
appeal
to
touch
him
but
soon
he
recovered
his
thank
you
said
he
i
much
obliged
to
you
now
i
in
the
right
and
you
are
in
the
and
he
put
himself
under
protection
of
the
police
and
fee
them
so
royally
that
they
were
zealous
on
his
behalf
and
rough
and
dictatorial
even
with
those
who
thronged
the
place
only
to
moan
and
lament
and
hold
up
their
ruined
children
you
move
on
you
misery
said
the
police
and
they
were
right
misery
gains
nothing
by
stopping
the
way
nothing
by
bemoaning
itself
but
if
the
banker
naturally
egotistical
and
now
entirely
wrapped
in
his
own
plans
and
fears
and
torments
was
deaf
to
the
anguish
of
his
clients
there
were
others
in
his
house
who
felt
it
keenly
and
deeply
alfred
and
jane
were
they
sat
hand
in
hand
in
a
little
room
drawn
closer
by
misfortune
and
heard
the
groans
at
their
door
and
the
tears
of
pity
ran
down
their
own
cheeks
hot
with
shame
and
alfred
wrote
on
the
of
his
ethics
a
vow
to
pay
every
shilling
his
father
owed
these
poor
people
before
he
died
it
was
like
him
and
like
his
happy
age
at
which
the
just
and
the
generous
can
command
in
imagination
the
means
to
do
kindred
deeds
soon
he
found
to
his
horror
that
he
had
seen
but
a
small
percentage
of
the
distress
his
father
had
caused
the
greater
griefs
as
usual
stayed
at
home
behind
the
gadding
woes
lay
a
terrible
number
of
silent
decent
ruined
homes
and
broken
hearts
and
mixed
sorrows
so
unmerited
so
complicated
so
piteous
and
so
cruel
that
he
was
ready
to
tear
his
hair
to
know
them
and
not
be
able
to
relieve
them
instantly
of
that
mere
sample
i
give
a
mere
sample
divine
the
bulk
then
and
revolve
a
page
of
human
history
often
turned
by
the
people
but
too
little
studied
by
statisticians
and
legislators
esgar
a
respectable
merchant
had
heavy
engagements
to
meet
which
his
money
lay
at
the
old
bank
living
at
a
distance
he
did
not
hear
the
news
till
near
and
he
had
promised
to
take
his
daughters
to
a
ball
that
night
he
did
so
left
them
there
went
home
packed
up
their
clothes
and
valuables
and
next
day
levanted
with
them
to
america
taking
all
the
money
he
could
scrape
together
in
london
and
so
he
passed
his
ruin
on
to
others

doctor
phillips
aged
warned
by
growing
infirmities
had
sold
a
tidy
practice
with
house
furniture
and
for
a
fair
price
and
put
it
in
the
bank
awaiting
some
investment
the
money
was
gone
now
and
the
poor
old
doctor
with
a
wife
and
daughter
and
a
crutch
was
at
once
a
pauper
and
an
exile
for
he
had
sold
under
the
usual
condition
not
to
practise
within
so
many
miles
of
his
successor
he
went
to
that
successor
and
begged
permission
to
be
his
assistant
at
a
small
small
salary
i
want
a
younger
man
was
the
reply
then
he
went
round
to
his
old
patients
and
begged
a
few
to
get
him
a
horse
and
chaise
and
keep
him
over
the
first
month
in
his
new
place
they
pitied
him
but
most
of
them
were
sufferers
too
by
hardie
and
all
they
gave
him
did
but
buy
a
donkey
and
cart
and
with
that
he
and
his
went
slowly
and
sadly
to
a
village
ten
miles
distant
from
the
place
where
all
his
life
had
been
spent
in
comfort
and
good
credit
the
poor
old
gentleman
often
looked
back
from
his
cart
at
the
church
spires
of
barkington
from
seventeen
till
now
almost
fourscore
there
lived
he
but
now
lived
there
no
more
at
seventeen
many
their
fortunes
seek
but
at
fourscore
it
is
too
old
a
arrived
at
his
village
he
had
to
sell
his
donkey
and
trust
to
his
crutch
and
so
infirmity
crept
about
begging
leave
to
cure
disease
with
what
success
may
be
inferred
from
this
miss
phillips
a
girl
of
eighteen
was
taken
up
by
farmer
giles
before
squire
langton
for
stealing
turnips
out
of
a
field
the
farmer
was
hard
and
his
losses
in
hardie
bank
had
made
him
bitter
hard
so
the
poor
girl
excuse
that
she
could
not
let
her
father
starve
had
no
effect
on
him
to
jail
she
should
go
find
however
that
squire
langton
resolutely
refused
to
commit
miss
phillips
the
real
reason
i
suspect
was
that
he
had
a
respect
for
the
gospel
and
not
much
for
the
law
except
those
invaluable
clauses
which
restrain
poaching
the
reason
he
gave
was
turnips
be
hanged
if
she
had
eaten
them
the
fly
however
he
found
means
to
muzzle
giles
and
sent
the
old
doctor
two
couple
of
rabbits
took
to
the
national
vice
and
went
to
the
national
dogs
thomas
fisher
a
saving
tinman
and
a

so
i
expect
no
pity
for
him

of

in

life
for
fear

for
miss
blanche
lunley
was
a
cripple
disorder
of
the
spine
had
robbed
her
in
very
bloom
of
the
power
not
only
to
dance
as
you
girls
do
but
to
walk
or
even
stand
upright
leaving
her
two
active
little
hands
and
a
heart
as
nearly
angelic
as
we
are
likely
to
see
here
on
earth
she
lay
all
day
long
on
a
little
iron
bedstead
at
the
window
of
their
that
looked
on
a
sunny
little
lawn
working
eagerly
for
the
poor
teaching
the
poor
young
and
old
to
read
chiefly
those
of
her
own
sex
hearing
the
sorrows
of
the
poor
composing
the
quarrels
of
the
poor
relieving
their
genuine
necessities
with
a
little
money
and
much
ingenuity
and
labour
some
poor
woman
in
a
moment
of
inspiration
called
miss
blanche
the
sunshine
of
the
the
word
was
instantly
caught
up
in
the
parish
and
had
now
this
many
years
gently
displaced
lunley
and
settled
on
her
here
below
and
its
echo
gone
before
her
up
to
heaven
the
poor
sunshine
of
the
poor
was
happy
life
was
sweet
to
her
to
know
whether
this
is
so
it
is
useless
to
inquire
of
the
backbone
or
the
limbs
look
at
the
face
she
lay
at
her
window
in
the
kindred
sunshine
and
in
a
world
of
sturdy
able
agile
cursers
grumblers
and
yawners
her
face
pale
its
ashes
wore
the
eternal
sunshine
of
a
happy
holy
smile
but
there
came
one
to
her
bedside
and
told
her
the
bank
was
broken
and
all
the
money
gone
she
and
her
sisters
had
lent
hardie
the
saint
clasped
her
hands
and
said
oh
my
poor
people
what
will
become
of
them
and
the
tears
ran
down
her
pale
and
now
sorrowful
cheeks
at
this
time
she
did
not
know
the
full
extent
of
their
losses
but
they
had
given
hardie
a
power
of
attorney
to
draw
out
all
their
consols
that
remorseless
man
had
abused
the
discretion
this
gave
him
and
beggared
them
they
were
his
personal
friends
too
to
swell
his
secret
hoard
when
the
sunshine
of
the
poor
heard
this
and
knew
that
she
was
now
the
poorest
of
the
poor
she
clasped
her
hands
and
cried
oh
my
poor
sisters
my
poor
sisters
and
she
could
work
no
more
for
sighing
the
next
morning
found
the
sunshine
of
the
poor
extinct
in
her
little
bed
ay
died
of
grief
with
no
grain
of
egotism
in
it
gone
straight
to
heaven
without
one
angry
word
against
richard
hardie
or
any
other
old
betty
had
a
horror
of
the
workhouse
to
save
her
old
age
from
it
she
had
deposited
her
wages
in
the
bank
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
also
a
little
legacy
from
hardie
father
she
now
went
about
the
house
of
her
master
and
debtor
declaring
she
was
sure
he
would
not
rob
and
if
he
did
she
would
never
go
into
the
poorhouse
i
go
out
on
the
common
and
die
there
nobody
will
miss
the
next
instance
led
to
consequences
upon
consequences
and
that
is
my
excuse
for
telling
it
the
reader
somewhat
more
fully
than
alfred
heard
it
maxley
one
night
found
something
rough
at
her
feet
in
bed
what
on
earth
is
this
said
she
never
you
mind
said
maxley
say
it
my
breeches
what
then
why
what
on
earth
does
the
man
put
his
breeches
to
bed
for
that
is
my
business
roared
maxley
and
whispered
drily
for
you
to
wear
this
little
spar
led
to
his
telling
her
he
had
drawn
out
all
their
money
but
when
she
asked
the
reason
he
snubbed
her
again
indirectly
recommending
her
to
sleep
the
fact
is
the
were
full
of
and
maxley
always
followed
them
into
bed
now
for
fear
of
robbers
the
bank
broke
on
a
tuesday
maxley
dug
on
impassive
and
when
curious
people
came
about
him
to
ask
whether
he
was
a
loser
he
used
to
inquire
very
gravely
and
dwelling
on
every
syllable
do
you
see
anything
green
in
this
ere
friday
was
club
day
the
clubsmen
met
at
the
greyhound
and
talked
over
their
losses
maxley
sat
smoking
complacently
and
when
his
turn
came
to
groan
he
said
drily
i
draad
all
mine
a
week
afore
exclamations
i
had
a
hinkling
my
boy
jack
he
wrote
to
me
from
canada
as
how
was
rotten
out
there
now
these
here
bankers
they
be
like
an
oak
tree
they
do
go
at
the
limbs
first
and
then
at
the
the
club
was
wroth
what
you
went
and
made
yourself
safe
and
never
gave
any
of
us
a
chance
was
that
neighbourly
was
that
clubbable
to
a
hailstorm
of
similar
reproaches
maxley
made
but
one
reply
business
to
take
care
o
he
added
however
a
little
sulkily
i
was
laad
for
slander
once
scalded
dog
fears
oh
said
one
i
do
believe
him
he
puts
a
good
face
on
it
but
his
nine
hundred
is
gone
along
with
gone
far
with
this
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
after
some
delay
pulled
out
a
nice
new
crisp
note
and
held
it
up
what
is
that
i
ask
the
looks
like
a
note
welt
the
bulk
with
the
sample
i
knows
where
to
find
eightscore
and
nine
to
match
this
the
note
was
handed
round
and
on
inspection
each
countenance
in
turn
wore
a
malicious
smile
till
at
last
maxley
surrounded
by
grinning
faces
felt
uneasy
what
be
all
grinning
at
like
a
litter
o
chessy
cats
war
ye
ugly
enough
without
showing
of
your
rotten
teeth
haw
haw
better
say
money
at
all
but
only
a
wench
curl
paper
and
he
got
up
and
snatched
it
fiercely
out
of
the
last
inspector
hand
ye
ca
run
your
rigs
on
me
said
he
what
an
if
i
ca
read
words
i
can
figures
and
i
spelt
the
ten
out
on
every
one
of
them
afore
take
a
loud
and
general
laugh
greeted
this
boast
then
maxley
snatched
up
his
hat
in
great
wrath
and
some
anxiety
and
went
out
followed
by
a
peal
in
five
minutes
he
was
at
home
and
tossed
the
note
into
his
wife
lap
she
was
knitting
by
a
farthing
dip
dame
said
he
controlling
all
appearance
of
anxiety
what
d
call
that
she
took
up
the
note
and
held
it
close
to
the
candle
why
jem
it
is
a
note
one
of
hardie
then
what
were
those
fools
laughing
at
and
he
told
her
all
that
had
happened
maxley
dropped
her
knitting
and
stood
up
trembling
why
you
told
me
you
had
got
our
money
all
safe
out
well
and
so
i
have
ye
foolish
woman
and
he
drew
the
whole
packet
out
of
his
pocket
and
flung
them
fiercely
on
the
table
maxley
ran
her
finger
and
eye
over
them
and
uttered
a
scream
of
anger
and
despair
these
these
be
all
hardie
notes
she
cried
and
what
vally
be
hardie
notes
when
hardie
be
broke
maxley
staggered
as
if
he
had
been
shot
the
woman
eyes
flashed
fury
at
him
this
is
your
work
ye
born
idiot
your
own
business
says
you
you
despise
your
wedded
wife
that
has
more
brains
in
her
finger
than
you
have
in
all
your
great
long
useless
carease
you
have
your
secrets
one
day
poison
another
day
beggary
you
have
ruined
me
you
have
murdered
me
get
out
of
my
sight
for
if
i
find
a
knife
i
put
it
in
you
i
and
in
her
ungovernable
passion
she
actually
ran
to
the
dresser
for
a
knife
at
which
maxley
caught
up
a
chair
and
lifted
it
furiously
above
his
head
to
fling
at
her
luckily
the
man
had
more
than
the
woman
he
dashed
the
chair
furiously
on
the
floor
and
ran
out
of
the
house
he
wandered
about
half
stupid
and
presently
his
feet
took
him
mechanically
round
to
his
garden
he
pottered
about
among
his
plants
looking
at
them
inspecting
them
closely
and
scarce
seeing
them
however
he
covered
up
one
or
two
and
muttered
i
think
there
will
be
a
frost
i
think
there
will
be
a
frost
then
his
legs
seemed
to
give
way
he
sat
down
and
thought
of
his
he
began
to
talk
to
himself
out
loud
as
some
people
do
in
trouble
bless
her
comely
face
said
he
and
to
think
i
had
my
arm
lifted
to
strike
her
after
wearing
her
so
low
and
finding
her
good
stuff
upon
the
whole
well
thank
my
stars
i
did
we
must
make
the
best
o
money
gone
but
here
the
garden
and
our
hands
still
and
as
if
we
were
single
to
gnaw
our
hearts
alone
wedded
life
cuts
grief
a
two
let
make
it
up
and
begin
again
sixty
come
martinmas
and
susan
and
i
be
weary
of
turning
he
went
round
to
his
front
door
there
was
a
crowd
round
it
a
buzzing
crowd
with
all
their
faces
turned
towards
his
door
he
came
at
their
backs
and
asked
peevishly
what
was
to
do
now
some
of
the
women
shrieked
at
his
voice
the
crowd
turned
about
and
a
score
of
faces
peered
at
him
some
filled
with
curiosity
some
with
pity
lord
help
us
said
the
poor
man
is
there
any
more
trouble
a
foot
stand
aside
please
and
let
me
no
no
cried
a
woman
do
let
not
let
me
go
into
my
own
house
young
woman
said
maxley
with
dignity
be
these
your
manners
oh
james
i
meant
you
no
poor
man
poor
soul
said
another
stand
aloof
said
a
strange
man
who
has
as
good
a
right
to
be
there
as
he
have
a
lane
was
made
directly
and
maxley
rushed
down
between
two
rows
of
peering
faces
with
his
knees
knocking
together
and
burst
into
his
own
house
a
scream
from
the
women
inside
as
he
entered
and
a
deep
groan
from
the
strong
man
bereaved
of
his
mate
told
the
tragedy
poor
susan
maxley
was
gone
she
had
died
of
within
a
minute
of
his
leaving
her
and
the
last
words
of
two
faithful
spouses
were
words
of
anger
all
these
things
and
many
more
less
tragic
but
very
deplorable
came
to
alfred
hardie
knowledge
and
galled
and
afflicted
him
deeply
and
several
of
these
revelations
heaped
discredit
high
upon
richard
hardie
till
the
young
man
born
with
a
keen
sense
of
justice
and
bred
amongst
honourable
minds
began
to
shudder
at
his
own
father
herein
he
was
alone
jane
with
the
affectionate
blindness
of
her
sex
could
throw
her
arms
round
her
father
neck
and
pity
him
for
his
losses
by
his
own
dishonesty
and
pity
him
most
when
some
victim
of
his
unprincipled
conduct
died
or
despaired
poor
papa
will
feel
this
so
deeply
was
her
only
comment
on
such
occasions
alfred
was
not
sorry
she
could
take
this
view
and
left
her
unmolested
to
confound
black
with
white
and
wrong
with
right
at
dictates
but
his
own
trained
understanding
was
not
to
be
duped
in
matters
of
plain
morality
and
so
unable
to
cure
the
wrongs
he
deplored
unable
to
put
his
conscience
into
his
pocket
like
richard
hardie
or
into
his
heart
like
jane
he
wandered
alone
or
sat
brooding
and
dejected
and
the
attentive
reader
if
i
am
so
fortunate
as
to
possess
one
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
he
was
troubled
too
with
dark
mysterious
surmises
he
half
dreaded
yet
felt
it
his
duty
to
fathom
these
and
dodd
loss
by
the
bank
combined
to
keep
him
out
of
albion
villa
he
often
called
to
ask
after
captain
dodd
but
was
ashamed
to
enter
the
house
now
richard
hardie
anxiety
to
know
whether
david
was
to
die
or
live
had
not
declined
but
rather
increased
if
the
latter
he
was
now
resolved
to
fly
to
the
united
states
with
his
booty
and
cheat
his
alienated
son
along
with
the
rest
he
had
come
by
degrees
down
to
this
it
was
on
alfred
he
had
counted
to
keep
him
informed
of
david
state
but
on
his
putting
a
smooth
inquiry
the
young
man
face
flushed
with
shame
or
anger
or
something
and
he
gave
a
very
short
sharp
and
obscure
reply
in
reality
he
did
not
know
much
nor
did
sarah
his
informant
for
of
late
the
servants
had
never
been
allowed
to
enter
david
room
hardie
after
this
rebuff
never
asked
alfred
again
but
having
heard
sampson
name
mentioned
as
dodd
medical
attendant
wrote
and
asked
him
to
come
and
dine
next
time
he
should
visit
barkington
you
will
find
me
a
fallen
man
said
he
we
resign
our
house
and
premises
and
furniture
to
the
assignees
and
go
to
live
at
a
little
furnished
cottage
not
very
far
from
your
friends
the
dodds
it
is
called
cottage
there
where
we
have
so
little
to
offer
besides
a
welcome
none
but
true
friends
will
come
near
us
indeed
there
are
very
few
i
should
venture
to
ask
for
such
a
proof
of
fidelity
to
your
broken
friend
r
the
sampson
sent
a
cordial
reply
and
came
to
dinner
at
musgrove
cottage
now
all
hardie
wanted
of
him
in
reality
was
to
know
about
david
so
when
jane
had
retired
and
the
decanter
circulated
he
began
to
pump
him
by
his
vanity
i
understand
said
he
you
have
wrought
one
of
your
surprising
cures
in
this
neighbourhood
albion
villa
sampson
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
hardie
eyes
sparkled
alfred
watched
him
keenly
and
bitterly
how
can
i
work
a
great
cure
after
these
short
and
osmond
look
see
the
man
had
been
wounded
in
the
hid
and
lost
blood
thin
stabbed
in
the
shoulder
and
lost
more
both
the
hardies
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
unfeigned
so
instid
of
recruiting
the
buddy
thus
exhausted
of
the
great
liquid
material
of
all
repair
the
profissional
came
and
exhausted
him
worse
stabbed
him
while
he
slept
stabbed
him
unconscious
stabbed
him
in
a
vein
and
stole
more
blood
from
him
was
that
enough
no
the
routine
of
profissional
had
but
begun
nixt
they
stabbed
him
with
and
so
stole
more
of
his
and
they
were
goen
from
their
stabs
to
their
bites
goen
to
leech
his
temples
and
so
hand
him
over
to
the
but
you
came
in
and
saved
him
cried
alfred
i
saved
his
life
said
sampson
sorrowfully
but
life
is
not
the
only
good
thing
a
man
may
be
robbed
of
by
those
who
steal
his
and
so
impoverish
and
water
the
contints
of
the
vessels
of
the
doctor
sampson
said
alfred
what
do
you
mean
by
these
mysterious
words
you
alarm
what
do
you
know
have
they
told
you
no
i
have
not
had
the
courage
to
enter
the
house
since
the
bank
he
stopped
in
confusion
ay
i
understand
said
sampson
however
it
ca
be
hidden
now
he
is
a
sampson
made
this
awful
announcement
soberly
and
sorrowfully
alfred
groaned
aloud
and
even
his
father
experienced
a
momentary
remorse
but
so
steady
had
been
the
progress
of
corruption
that
he
felt
almost
unmixed
joy
the
next
instant
and
his
son
surprised
the
latter
sentiment
in
his
face
and
shuddered
with
disgust
sampson
went
on
to
say
that
he
believed
the
poor
man
had
gone
flourishing
a
razor
and
dodd
had
said
yes
kill
me
david
kill
the
mother
of
your
children
and
never
moved
which
feminine
or
in
other
words
irrational
behaviour
had
somehow
disarmed
him
but
it
would
not
happen
again
his
sister
had
come
a
sensible
resolute
woman
she
had
signed
the
order
and
osmond
and
he
the
certificates
and
he
was
gone
to
a
private
asylum
talking
of
that
said
sampson
rising
suddenly
i
must
go
and
give
them
a
word
of
comfort
for
they
are
just
breaking
their
hearts
at
parting
with
him
poor
things
i
be
back
in
an
on
his
departure
jane
returned
and
made
the
tea
in
the
they
lived
like
that
now
hardie
took
it
from
his
favourite
lithe
white
hand
and
smiled
on
her
he
should
not
have
to
go
to
a
foreign
land
after
all
who
would
believe
a
madman
if
he
should
rave
about
his
thousands
he
sipped
his
tea
luxuriously
and
presently
delivered
himself
thus
with
bland
my
dear
alfred
some
time
ago
you
wished
to
marry
a
young
lady
without
fortune
you
thought
that
i
had
a
large
one
and
you
expected
me
to
supply
all
deficiencies
you
did
not
overrate
my
parental
feeling
but
you
did
my
means
i
would
have
done
this
for
you
and
with
pleasure
but
for
my
own
coming
misfortunes
as
it
was
i
said
and
when
you
demanded
somewhat
peremptorily
my
reasons
i
said
me
well
you
see
i
was
right
such
a
marriage
would
have
been
your
utter
ruin
however
i
conclude
after
what
sampson
has
told
us
you
have
resigned
it
on
other
grounds
jane
my
dear
captain
dodd
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
afflicted
he
has
gone
gone
mad
oh
how
shocking
what
will
become
of
his
poor
children
she
thought
of
edward
first
we
have
just
heard
it
from
sampson
and
i
presume
alfred
you
are
not
so
far
gone
as
to
insist
on
propagating
insanity
by
a
marriage
with
his
at
this
conclusion
which
struck
her
obliquely
though
aimed
at
alfred
jane
sighed
gently
and
her
dream
of
earthly
happiness
seemed
to
melt
away
but
alfred
ground
his
teeth
and
replied
with
great
bitterness
and
emotion
i
think
sir
you
are
the
last
man
who
ought
to
congratulate
yourself
on
the
affliction
that
has
fallen
on
that
unhappy
family
i
aspire
to
enter
all
the
more
that
now
they
have
calamities
for
me
to
share
more
fool
you
put
in
hardie
calmly
for
i
much
fear
you
are
one
of
the
causes
of
that
hardie
assumed
a
puzzled
air
i
do
see
how
that
can
be
do
you
jenny
sampson
told
us
the
causes
a
wound
on
the
head
a
wound
in
the
arm
bleeding
cupping
there
may
be
other
causes
sampson
has
not
been
told
of
yet
possibly
i
really
do
know
what
you
allude
the
son
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
father
and
leaned
across
the
table
to
him
till
their
faces
nearly
met
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
chapter
xxv
hardie
was
taken
by
surprise
for
once
and
had
not
a
word
to
say
but
looked
in
his
son
face
mute
and
gasping
as
a
fish
during
this
painful
silence
his
children
eyed
him
inquiringly
but
not
with
the
same
result
for
one
face
is
often
read
differently
by
two
persons
to
jane
whose
intelligence
had
no
aids
he
seemed
unaffectedly
puzzled
but
alfred
discerned
beneath
his
wonder
the
terror
of
detection
rising
and
then
thrust
back
by
the
strong
will
that
stoical
face
shut
again
like
an
iron
door
but
not
quickly
enough
the
right
words
the
open
sesame
had
been
spoken
and
one
unguarded
look
had
confirmed
alfred
vague
suspicions
of
foul
play
he
turned
his
own
face
away
he
was
alienated
by
the
occurrences
of
the
last
few
months
but
nature
and
tender
reminiscences
still
held
him
by
some
fibres
of
the
heart
in
a
moment
of
natural
indignation
he
had
applied
the
touchstone
but
its
success
grieved
him
he
could
not
bear
to
go
on
exposing
his
father
so
he
left
the
room
with
a
deep
sigh
in
which
pity
mingled
with
shame
and
regret
he
wandered
out
into
the
silent
night
and
soon
was
leaning
on
the
gate
of
albion
villa
gazing
wistfully
at
the
windows
and
sore
perplexed
and
nobly
wretched
as
he
was
going
out
hardie
raised
his
eyebrows
with
a
look
of
disinterested
wonder
and
curiosity
and
touched
his
forehead
to
jane
as
much
as
to
say
is
he
disordered
in
his
mind
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
he
asked
her
coolly
what
alfred
meant
she
said
she
had
no
idea
then
he
examined
her
keenly
about
this
fourteen
thousand
pounds
and
found
to
his
relief
alfred
had
never
even
mentioned
it
to
her
and
now
richard
hardie
like
his
son
wanted
to
be
alone
and
think
over
this
new
peril
that
had
risen
in
the
bosom
of
his
own
family
and
for
once
the
company
of
his
favourite
child
was
irksome
he
made
an
excuse
and
strolled
out
in
his
turn
into
the
silent
night
it
was
calm
and
clear
the
thousand
holy
eyes
under
which
men
prefer
to
do
their
crimes
except
when
they
are
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
wait
looked
down
and
seemed
to
wonder
anything
can
be
so
silly
as
to
sin
and
beneath
their
pure
gaze
the
man
of
the
world
pondered
with
all
his
soul
he
tormented
himself
with
conjectures
through
what
channel
did
alfred
suspect
him
through
the
dodds
were
they
aware
of
their
loss
had
the
spoken
if
so
why
had
not
dodd
or
her
son
attacked
him
but
then
perhaps
alfred
was
their
agent
they
wished
to
try
a
friendly
remonstrance
through
a
mutual
friend
before
proceeding
to
extremities
this
accorded
with
dodd
character
as
he
remembered
her
the
solution
was
reasonable
but
he
was
relieved
of
it
by
recollecting
what
alfred
had
said
that
he
had
not
entered
the
house
since
the
bank
broke
on
this
he
began
to
hope
alfred
might
be
a
mere
suspicion
he
could
not
establish
by
any
proof
and
at
all
events
he
would
lock
it
in
his
own
breast
like
a
good
son
his
never
having
given
a
hint
even
to
his
sister
favoured
this
supposition
thus
meditating
hardie
found
himself
at
the
gate
of
albion
villa
yet
he
had
strolled
out
with
no
particular
intention
of
going
there
had
his
mind
apprehensive
of
danger
from
that
quarter
driven
his
body
thither
he
took
a
look
at
the
house
and
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
young
lady
leaning
over
the
balcony
and
murmuring
softly
to
a
male
figure
below
whose
outline
hardie
could
hardly
discern
for
it
stood
in
the
shadow
hardie
was
delighted
aha
miss
juliet
said
he
if
alfred
does
not
visit
you
some
one
else
does
you
have
soon
supplied
your
peevish
lover
he
then
withdrew
softly
from
the
gate
not
to
disturb
the
intrigue
and
watched
a
few
yards
off
determined
to
see
who
julia
nightly
visitor
was
and
give
alfred
surprise
for
surprise
he
had
not
long
to
wait
the
man
came
away
directly
and
walked
head
erect
past
hardie
and
glanced
full
in
his
face
but
did
not
vouchsafe
him
a
word
it
was
alfred
himself
hardie
was
profoundly
alarmed
and
indignant
the
young
traitor
never
enter
the
house
no
but
he
comes
and
tells
her
everything
directly
under
her
window
on
the
sly
and
when
he
is
caught
defies
me
to
my
and
now
he
suspected
female
cunning
and
malice
in
the
way
that
thunderbolt
had
been
quietly
prepared
for
him
and
launched
without
warning
in
his
very
daughter
presence
and
the
result
just
communicated
to
julia
dodd
in
a
very
gloomy
mood
he
followed
his
son
and
heard
his
firm
though
elastic
tread
on
the
frosty
ground
and
saw
how
loftily
he
carried
his
head
and
from
that
moment
feared
and
very
very
nearly
hated
him
the
next
day
he
feigned
sick
and
sent
for
osmond
that
worthy
prescribed
a
pill
and
a
draught
the
former
laxative
the
latter
astringent
this
ceremony
performed
hardie
gossipped
with
him
and
after
a
detour
or
two
glided
to
his
real
anxiety
sampson
tells
me
you
know
more
about
captain
dodd
case
than
he
does
he
is
not
very
clear
as
to
the
cause
of
the
poor
man
going
the
cause
why
yes
but
i
mean
what
caused
the
apoplexy
osmond
replied
that
apoplexy
was
often
idiopathic
captain
dodd
as
he
understood
had
fallen
down
in
the
street
in
a
sudden
fit
but
as
for
the
mania
that
is
to
be
attributed
to
an
insufficient
evacuation
of
blood
while
under
the
apoplectic
arising
of
a
term
rather
hastily
applied
to
disorders
the
coming
signs
of
which
have
not
been
detected
by
the
medical
attendant
the
birth
of
topsy
was
idiopathic
in
that
learned
lady
not
bled
enough
why
sampson
says
it
is
because
he
was
bled
too
osmond
was
amused
at
this
and
repeated
that
the
mania
came
of
not
being
bled
enough
the
discussion
was
turned
into
an
unexpected
quarter
by
the
entrance
of
jane
hardie
who
came
timidly
in
and
said
oh
osmond
i
can
not
let
you
go
without
telling
you
how
anxious
i
am
about
alfred
he
is
so
thin
and
pale
and
nonsense
jane
said
hardie
have
we
not
all
cause
to
be
dejected
in
this
house
but
she
persisted
gently
that
there
was
more
in
it
than
that
and
his
headaches
were
worse
and
she
could
not
be
easy
any
longer
without
advice
ah
those
headaches
said
osmond
they
always
made
me
uneasy
to
tell
the
truth
miss
hardie
i
have
noticed
a
remarkable
change
in
him
but
i
did
not
like
to
excite
apprehensions
and
so
he
mopes
does
he
seeks
solitude
and
is
taciturn
and
dejected
yes
but
i
do
not
mind
that
so
much
as
his
turning
so
pale
and
oh
it
is
all
part
of
one
then
you
know
what
is
the
matter
i
think
i
do
and
yours
is
a
wise
and
timely
anxiety
your
brother
is
a
very
delicate
case
of
hyperaesthetic
character
and
i
should
like
to
have
the
advice
of
a
profound
physician
let
me
see
wycherley
will
be
with
me
may
i
bring
him
over
as
a
friend
this
proposal
did
not
at
all
suit
hardie
he
put
his
own
construction
on
alfred
pallor
and
dejection
and
was
uneasy
at
the
idea
of
his
being
by
a
couple
of
doctors
no
no
said
he
taff
has
fancies
enough
already
i
can
not
have
you
gentlemen
coming
here
to
fill
his
head
with
many
oh
he
has
fancies
has
he
said
osmond
keenly
my
dear
sir
we
shall
not
say
one
word
to
that
might
irritate
him
but
i
should
like
to
hear
a
truly
learned
jane
looked
so
imploringly
that
hardie
yielded
a
reluctant
assent
on
those
terms
so
the
next
day
by
appointment
osmond
introduced
his
friend
wycherley
bland
and
bald
with
a
fine
bead
and
a
face
naturally
intelligent
but
crossed
every
now
and
then
by
gleams
of
vacancy
a
man
of
large
reading
and
of
tact
to
make
it
subserve
his
interests
a
voluminous
writer
on
certain
medical
subjects
he
had
so
saturated
himself
with
circumlocution
that
it
distilled
from
his
very
tongue
he
talked
like
an
article
a
quarterly
one
and
so
gained
two
advantages
he
rarely
irritated
a
for
if
he
began
a
sentence
hot
what
with
its
length
and
what
with
its
windiness
he
ended
it
cool
item
stabs
by
polysyllables
are
pricks
by
sponges
this
foible
earned
him
the
admiration
of
fools
and
that
is
as
invaluable
as
they
are
innumerable
yet
was
there
in
the
he
despised
one
gem
of
a
word
he
vastly
admired
like
most
quarterly
writers
that
charming
word
the
pet
of
the
polysyllabic
was
he
opened
the
matter
in
a
subdued
and
sympathising
tone
well
calculated
to
win
a
loving
father
such
as
richard
hardie
was
not
my
good
friend
here
informs
me
sir
you
are
so
fortunate
as
to
possess
a
son
of
distinguished
abilities
and
who
is
at
present
labouring
under
some
of
those
precursory
indications
of
incipient
disease
of
the
organs
of
which
i
have
been
i
may
say
somewhat
successful
in
diagnosing
the
symptoms
unless
i
have
been
misinformed
he
has
for
a
considerable
time
experienced
persistent
headache
of
a
kephalalgic
or
true
cerebral
type
and
has
now
advanced
to
the
succeeding
stage
of
taciturnity
and
depression
unaccompanied
with
isolation
and
probably
constipation
but
as
yet
without
hallucination
though
possibly
and
as
my
experience
of
the
great
majority
of
these
cases
would
induce
me
to
say
probably
he
is
undisturbed
by
one
or
more
of
those
latent
and
at
first
trifling
aberrations
either
of
the
intelligence
or
the
senses
which
in
their
preliminary
stages
escape
the
observation
of
all
but
the
expert
there
you
see
said
osmond
dr
wycherley
agrees
with
me
yet
i
assure
you
i
have
only
detailed
the
symptoms
and
not
the
conclusion
i
had
formed
from
jane
inquired
timidly
what
that
conclusion
was
miss
hardie
we
think
it
one
of
those
obscure
tendencies
which
are
very
curable
if
taken
in
time
wycherley
ended
the
sentence
but
no
longer
remediable
if
the
fleeting
opportunity
is
allowed
to
escape
and
diseased
action
to
pass
into
diseased
jane
looked
awestruck
at
their
solemnity
but
hardie
who
was
taking
advice
against
the
grain
turned
satirical
gentleman
said
he
be
pleased
to
begin
by
moderating
your
own
obscurity
and
then
perhaps
i
shall
see
better
how
to
cure
my
son
disorder
what
the
deuce
are
you
driving
at
the
two
doctors
looked
at
one
another
inquiringly
and
so
settled
how
to
proceed
wycherley
explained
to
hardie
that
there
was
a
sort
of
general
unreasonable
and
superstitious
feeling
abroad
a
kind
of
terror
of
the
complaint
with
which
his
son
was
threatened
and
which
instead
of
the
most
remediable
of
disorders
is
looked
at
as
the
most
incurable
of
maladies
it
was
on
this
account
he
had
learned
to
approach
the
subject
with
singular
caution
and
even
with
a
timidity
which
was
kinder
in
appearance
than
in
reality
that
he
must
admit
well
you
may
speak
out
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
said
hardie
with
consummate
indifference
oh
yes
said
jane
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
pray
conceal
nothing
from
well
then
sir
i
have
not
as
yet
had
the
advantage
of
examining
your
son
personally
but
from
the
diagnostics
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
he
is
labouring
under
the
first
of
perturbation
to
speak
plainly
the
symptoms
are
characteristic
of
the
initiatory
stage
of
the
germination
of
a
morbid
state
of
the
phenomena
of
his
unprofessional
hearers
only
stared
in
one
word
then
said
wycherley
waxing
impatient
at
their
abominable
obtuseness
it
is
the
premonitory
stage
of
the
precursory
condition
of
an
organic
affection
of
the
oh
said
hardie
the
brain
i
see
the
boy
is
going
what
a
blessing
there
are
a
few
english
words
left
in
all
our
dialects
the
doctors
stared
in
their
turn
at
the
prodigious
coolness
of
a
tender
parent
not
exactly
said
wycherley
i
am
habitually
averse
to
exaggeration
of
symptoms
your
son
suggest
to
me
incubation
of
insanity
nothing
jane
uttered
an
exclamation
of
horror
the
doctor
soothed
her
with
an
assurance
that
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
incipient
aberration
was
of
easy
cure
the
mischief
lay
in
delay
miss
hardie
said
he
paternally
during
a
long
and
busy
professional
career
it
has
been
my
painful
province
to
witness
the
deplorable
consequences
of
the
by
friends
and
relatives
of
the
precedent
symptoms
of
those
organic
affections
of
the
brain
the
relief
of
which
was
within
the
reach
of
therapeutic
agents
if
exhibited
he
went
on
to
deplore
the
blind
prejudice
of
unprofessional
persons
who
choose
to
fancy
that
other
diseases
creep
but
insanity
pounces
on
a
man
which
he
expressed
thus
neatly
that
other
deviations
from
organic
conditions
of
health
are
the
subject
of
clearly
defined
though
delicate
gradations
but
that
the
worst
and
most
climacteric
forms
of
disorder
are
suddenly
developed
affections
presenting
no
evidence
of
any
antecedent
cephalic
organic
change
and
unaccompanied
by
a
premonitory
stage
or
by
incipient
this
chimera
he
proceeded
to
confute
by
experience
he
had
repeatedly
been
called
in
to
cases
of
mania
described
as
sudden
and
almost
invariably
found
the
patient
had
been
cranky
for
years
which
he
condensed
thus
his
conduct
and
behaviour
for
many
years
previously
to
any
symptom
of
mental
aberration
being
noticed
had
been
characterised
by
actions
quite
irreconcilable
with
the
supposition
of
the
existence
of
perfect
sanity
of
he
instanced
a
parson
whom
he
had
lately
attended
and
found
him
as
constipated
and
as
convinced
he
was
john
the
baptist
engaged
to
the
princess
mary
as
could
be
but
continued
the
learned
doctor
upon
investigation
of
this
afflicted
ecclesiastic
antecedent
history
i
discovered
that
for
years
before
this
he
had
exhibited
conduct
incompatible
with
the
hypothesis
of
a
mind
whose
equilibrium
had
been
undisturbed
he
had
caused
a
number
of
valuable
trees
to
be
cut
down
on
his
estate
without
being
able
to
offer
a
sane
justification
for
such
an
outrageous
proceeding
and
had
actually
disposed
of
a
quantity
of
his
patrimonial
acres
clearly
he
never
would
have
parted
with
had
he
been
in
anything
resembling
a
condition
of
did
he
sell
the
land
and
timber
below
the
market
price
inquired
hardie
perking
up
and
exhibiting
his
first
symptoms
of
interest
in
the
discussion
on
that
head
sir
my
informant
his
gave
me
no
information
nor
did
i
enter
into
that
class
of
detail
you
naturally
look
at
morbid
phenomena
in
a
commercial
spirit
but
we
regard
them
medically
and
all
this
time
most
assiduously
visiting
the
sick
of
his
parish
and
preaching
admirable
the
next
instance
he
gave
was
of
a
stockbroker
suffering
under
general
paralysis
and
a
rooted
idea
that
all
the
in
the
bank
of
england
was
his
and
ministers
in
league
with
foreign
governments
to
keep
him
out
of
it
him
said
the
doctor
i
discovered
to
have
been
for
years
guilty
of
conduct
entirely
incompatible
with
the
hypothesis
of
undisordered
mental
functions
he
had
accused
his
domestics
of
peculation
and
had
initiated
legal
proceedings
with
a
view
of
prosecuting
in
a
court
of
law
one
of
his
oldest
whence
you
infer
that
if
my
son
has
not
for
years
been
doing
cranky
acts
he
is
not
likely
to
be
deranged
at
this
adroit
twist
of
the
argument
rather
surprised
wycherley
however
he
was
at
no
loss
for
a
reply
it
is
not
insanity
but
the
incubation
of
insanity
which
is
suspected
in
your
intelligent
case
and
the
best
course
will
be
for
me
to
enumerate
in
general
terms
the
several
symptoms
of
incubation
of
insanity
he
concluded
with
some
severity
after
that
sir
i
shall
cease
to
intrude
what
i
fear
is
an
unwelcome
the
parent
whose
levity
and
cold
reception
of
good
tidings
he
had
thus
mildly
yet
with
due
dignity
rebuked
was
a
man
of
the
world
and
liked
to
make
friends
not
enemies
so
he
took
the
hint
and
made
a
very
civil
speech
assuring
wycherley
that
if
he
ventured
to
differ
from
him
he
was
none
the
less
obliged
by
the
kind
interest
he
took
in
a
comparative
stranger
and
would
be
very
glad
to
hear
all
about
the
incubation
of
wycherley
bowed
slightly
and
complied
one
diagnostic
preliminary
sign
of
abnormal
cerebral
action
is
kephalalgia
or
true
cerebral
headache
i
mean
persistent
headache
not
accompanied
by
a
furred
tongue
or
other
indicia
significant
of
abdominal
or
renal
disorder
as
its
jane
sighed
he
has
sad
the
succeeding
symptom
is
a
morbid
affection
of
sleep
either
the
patient
suffers
from
insomnia
or
else
from
hypersomnia
which
we
subdivide
into
sopor
carus
and
lethargus
or
thirdly
from
kakosomnia
or
a
propensity
to
mere
dozing
and
to
all
the
morbid
phenomena
of
papa
said
jane
poor
alfred
sleeps
very
badly
i
hear
him
walking
at
all
hours
of
the
i
thought
as
much
said
wycherley
insomnia
is
the
commonest
feature
to
resume
the
insidious
advance
of
morbid
thought
is
next
marked
by
high
spirits
or
else
by
low
spirits
generally
the
latter
the
patient
begins
by
moping
then
shows
great
lassitude
and
ennui
then
becomes
abstracted
moody
and
occupied
with
a
solitary
jane
clasped
her
hands
and
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
so
well
did
this
description
tally
with
poor
alfred
case
and
at
this
period
continued
wycherley
my
experience
leads
me
to
believe
that
some
latent
delusion
is
generally
germinating
in
the
mind
though
often
concealed
with
consummate
craft
by
the
patient
the
open
development
of
this
delusion
is
the
next
stage
and
with
this
last
morbid
phenomenon
incubation
ceases
and
insanity
begins
sometimes
however
the
illusion
is
physical
rather
than
psychical
of
the
sense
rather
than
of
the
intelligence
it
commences
at
night
the
incubator
begins
by
seeing
nocturnal
visions
often
of
a
character
or
hearing
nocturnal
sounds
neither
of
which
have
any
material
existence
being
conveyed
to
his
optic
or
auricular
nerves
not
from
without
but
from
within
by
the
agency
of
a
disordered
brain
these
the
reason
hitherto
unimpaired
combats
at
first
especially
when
they
are
nocturnal
only
but
being
reproduced
and
becoming
diurnal
the
judgment
succumbs
under
the
morbid
impression
produced
so
repeatedly
these
are
the
ordinary
antecedent
symptoms
characteristic
of
the
incubation
of
insanity
to
which
are
frequently
added
somatic
exaltation
or
in
popular
language
physical
excitability
a
disposition
to
knit
the
brows
great
activity
of
the
mental
faculties
or
else
a
decline
of
the
powers
of
the
understanding
an
exaggeration
of
the
normal
conditions
of
thought
or
a
reversal
of
the
mental
habits
and
sentiments
such
as
a
sudden
aversion
to
some
person
hitherto
beloved
or
some
study
long
relished
and
luminous
jane
asked
leave
to
note
these
all
down
in
her
hardie
assented
adroitly
for
he
was
thinking
whether
he
could
not
sift
some
grain
out
of
all
this
chaff
should
alfred
blab
his
suspicions
here
were
two
gentlemen
who
would
at
all
events
help
him
to
throw
ridicule
on
them
wycherley
having
politely
aided
jane
hardie
to
note
down
the
preliminary
process
of
the
incubation
of
disorders
of
the
intellect
resumed
now
sir
your
son
appears
to
be
in
a
very
inchoate
stage
of
the
malady
he
has
cerebral
kephalalgia
and
insomnia
and
oh
doctor
said
jane
he
knits
his
brows
often
and
has
given
up
his
studies
wo
go
back
to
oxford
this
exactly
and
seeks
isolation
and
is
a
prey
to
morbid
distraction
and
reverie
but
has
no
palpable
illusions
has
he
not
that
i
know
of
said
hardie
well
but
objected
jane
did
not
he
say
something
to
you
very
curious
the
other
night
about
captain
dodd
and
fourteen
thousand
pounds
hardie
blood
ran
cold
no
he
stammered
not
that
i
oh
yes
he
did
papa
you
have
forgotten
it
but
at
the
time
you
were
quite
puzzled
what
he
could
meant
and
you
did
she
put
her
finger
to
her
forehead
and
the
doctors
interchanged
a
meaning
glance
i
believe
you
are
right
jenny
said
hardie
taking
the
cue
so
unexpectedly
offered
him
he
did
say
some
nonsense
i
could
not
make
head
nor
tail
of
but
we
all
have
our
crotchets
there
run
away
like
a
good
girl
and
let
me
explain
all
this
to
our
good
friends
here
and
mind
not
a
word
about
it
to
when
she
was
gone
he
said
gentlemen
my
son
is
over
head
and
ears
in
love
that
is
ay
erotic
monomania
is
a
very
ordinary
phase
of
insanity
said
wycherley
his
unreasonable
passion
for
a
girl
he
knows
he
can
never
marry
makes
him
somewhat
crotchety
and
cranky
that
and
may
have
unhinged
his
mind
a
little
suppose
i
send
him
abroad
my
good
brother
will
find
the
means
or
we
could
advance
it
him
i
and
the
other
trustees
he
comes
into
ten
thousand
pounds
in
a
month
or
the
doctors
exchanged
a
meaning
look
they
then
dissuaded
him
earnestly
from
the
idea
of
continental
travel
coelum
non
animam
mutant
qui
trans
mare
currunt
said
wycherley
and
osmond
explained
that
alfred
would
brood
abroad
as
well
as
at
home
if
he
went
alone
and
wycherley
summed
up
thus
the
most
advisable
course
is
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
personal
superintendence
of
some
skilful
physician
possessed
of
means
and
appliances
of
every
sort
for
soothing
and
restraining
the
specific
hardie
did
not
at
first
see
the
exact
purport
of
this
oleaginous
periphrasis
presently
he
caught
a
glimpse
but
said
he
thought
confinement
was
hardly
the
thing
to
drive
away
melancholy
not
in
all
respects
replied
wycherley
but
on
the
other
hand
a
little
gentle
restraint
is
the
safest
way
of
effecting
a
disruption
of
the
fatal
associations
that
have
engendered
and
tend
to
perpetuate
the
disorder
besides
the
medicinal
appliances
are
invaluable
including
as
they
do
the
nocturnal
and
diurnal
attendance
of
a
physician
who
knows
the
psychosomatic
relation
of
body
and
mind
and
can
apply
physical
remedies
of
the
effect
of
which
on
the
physical
instrument
of
intelligence
the
grey
matter
of
the
brain
we
have
seen
so
many
the
good
doctor
then
feelingly
deplored
the
inhumanity
of
parents
and
guardians
in
declining
to
subject
their
incubators
to
opportune
and
salutary
restraint
under
the
more
than
parental
care
of
a
psychosomatic
physician
on
this
head
he
got
quite
warm
and
inveighed
against
the
abominable
of
the
thing
it
is
contrary
said
he
to
every
principle
of
justice
and
humanity
that
a
deranged
perhaps
only
on
one
point
should
for
the
want
of
the
early
attention
of
those
whose
duty
it
is
to
watch
over
him
linger
out
his
existence
separated
from
all
who
are
dear
to
him
and
condemned
without
any
crime
to
be
a
prisoner
for
hardie
was
puzzled
by
this
sentence
in
which
the
speaker
usual
method
was
reversed
and
the
thought
was
bigger
than
the
words
oh
said
he
at
last
i
see
we
ought
to
incarcerate
our
children
to
keep
them
from
being
that
is
one
way
of
putting
it
with
a
vengence
said
osmond
staring
no
what
my
good
friend
means
is
this
where
the
patient
is
possessor
of
an
income
of
such
a
character
as
to
enable
his
friends
to
show
a
sincere
affection
by
anticipating
the
consequences
of
neglected
morbid
phenomena
of
the
brain
there
a
lamentable
want
of
humanity
is
exhibited
by
the
persistent
refusal
to
the
patient
on
the
part
of
his
relatives
of
the
incalculable
advantage
of
the
authoritative
advice
of
a
competent
physician
accompanied
with
the
safeguards
and
preventives
of
but
ere
the
mellifluous
pleonast
had
done
oiling
his
paradox
with
fresh
polysyllables
to
make
it
slip
into
the
banker
narrow
understanding
he
met
with
a
curious
interruption
jane
hardie
fluttered
in
to
say
a
man
was
at
the
door
accusing
himself
of
being
deranged
how
often
this
sort
of
coincidence
occurs
said
osmond
philosophically
do
not
refuse
him
dear
papa
it
is
not
for
money
he
only
wants
you
to
give
him
an
order
to
go
into
a
lunatic
now
there
is
a
sensible
man
said
wycherley
well
but
objected
hardie
if
he
is
a
sensible
man
why
does
he
want
to
go
to
an
asylum
oh
they
are
all
sensible
at
times
observed
osmond
singularly
so
said
wycherley
warmly
and
he
showed
a
desire
to
examine
this
paragon
who
had
the
sense
to
know
he
was
out
of
his
senses
it
would
be
but
kind
of
you
sir
said
jane
poor
poor
man
she
added
he
did
not
like
to
come
in
and
would
they
mind
just
going
out
to
him
oh
no
not
in
the
least
especially
as
you
seem
interested
in
and
they
all
three
rose
and
went
out
together
and
found
the
petitioner
at
the
front
door
who
should
it
be
but
james
maxley
his
beard
was
unshaven
his
face
haggard
and
everything
about
him
showed
a
man
broken
in
spirit
as
well
as
fortune
even
his
voice
had
lost
half
its
vigour
and
whenever
he
had
uttered
a
consecutive
sentence
or
two
his
head
dropped
on
his
breast
pitiably
indeed
this
sometimes
occurred
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
then
the
rest
of
it
died
on
his
lips
richard
hardie
was
not
prepared
to
encounter
one
of
his
unhappy
creditors
thus
publicly
and
to
shorten
the
annoyance
would
have
dismissed
him
roughly
but
he
dared
not
for
maxley
was
no
longer
alone
nor
unfriended
when
jane
left
him
to
intercede
for
him
a
young
man
joined
him
and
was
now
comforting
him
with
kind
words
and
trying
to
get
him
to
smoke
a
cigar
and
this
young
gentleman
was
the
banker
son
in
the
flesh
and
his
opposite
in
spirit
alfred
hardie
finding
these
two
in
contact
the
doctors
interchanged
demurest
glances
hardie
asked
maxley
sullenly
what
he
wanted
of
them
well
sir
said
maxley
despondingly
i
have
been
to
all
the
other
magistrates
in
the
borough
for
what
with
losing
my
money
and
what
with
losing
my
missus
i
think
i
bai
quite
right
in
my
head
i
do
see
such
curious
things
enough
to
make
a
body
skin
creep
at
and
down
went
his
head
on
his
chest
well
said
hardie
peevishly
go
on
you
went
to
the
magistrates
and
what
then
maxley
looked
up
and
seemed
to
recover
the
thread
why
they
said
they
could
send
me
to
the
not
from
home
i
must
be
a
pauper
first
so
then
my
neighbours
they
said
i
had
better
come
to
and
down
went
his
head
again
well
but
said
hardie
you
can
not
expect
me
to
go
against
the
other
why
not
sir
you
have
had
a
hatful
o
money
of
me
the
other
gentlemen
ha
had
a
farthing
they
owes
me
no
service
but
you
does
nine
hundred
pounds
worth
if
ye
come
to
there
was
no
malice
in
this
it
was
a
plain
man
notion
of
give
and
take
but
it
was
a
all
the
same
and
hardie
was
visibly
discountenanced
and
alfred
more
so
osmond
to
relieve
a
situation
so
painful
asked
maxley
rather
hastily
what
were
the
curious
things
he
saw
maxley
shuddered
the
unreasonablest
beasts
sir
you
ever
saw
or
heard
tell
on
mostly
snakes
and
dragons
ca
stoop
my
head
to
do
no
work
for
them
sir
bless
your
heart
if
i
was
to
leave
you
gentlemen
now
and
go
and
dig
for
five
minutes
in
my
garden
they
would
come
about
me
as
thick
as
slugs
on
cabbage
why
was
but
i
tried
to
hoe
a
bit
and
up
come
the
fearfullest
great
fiery
sarpint
scared
me
so
i
heaved
my
hoe
and
laid
on
un
properly
presently
i
seemed
to
come
out
of
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
a
red
mist
into
the
clear
and
there
laid
my
poor
missus
favourite
hen
i
had
been
and
killed
her
for
a
sarpint
he
sighed
then
after
a
moment
pause
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
now
suppose
i
was
to
go
and
take
some
poor
christian
for
one
of
these
bloody
dragons
i
do
see
at
odd
times
i
might
do
him
a
mischief
you
know
and
not
mean
him
no
harm
neither
oh
dooee
take
and
have
me
locked
up
gentlemen
dooee
now
tellee
i
ai
fit
to
be
about
my
poor
head
is
so
well
well
said
hardie
i
give
you
an
order
for
the
what
make
a
pauper
of
me
i
can
not
help
it
said
the
magistrate
it
is
the
routine
and
it
was
settled
at
a
meeting
of
the
bench
last
month
that
we
must
adhere
to
the
rule
as
strictly
as
possible
the
asylum
is
so
full
and
you
know
maxley
it
is
not
as
if
you
were
that
i
be
sir
i
do
know
what
i
a
looking
at
or
a
doing
would
i
ha
gone
and
killed
my
poor
susan
hen
if
i
had
a
been
beside
myself
and
she
in
her
grave
poor
dear
no
not
for
untold
gold
and
i
be
fond
of
that
too
used
to
be
however
but
now
i
do
seem
to
care
for
money
nor
nothing
and
his
head
dropped
look
here
maxley
old
fellow
said
alfred
sarcastically
you
must
go
to
the
workhouse
and
stay
there
till
you
hoe
a
pauper
take
him
for
a
crocodile
and
kill
him
then
you
will
get
into
an
asylum
whether
the
barkington
magistrates
like
it
or
not
that
is
the
i
believe
and
as
reasonable
as
most
wycherley
admired
alfred
for
this
and
whispered
osmond
how
subtly
they
hardie
did
not
deign
to
answer
his
son
who
indeed
had
spoken
at
him
and
not
to
him
as
for
poor
maxley
he
was
in
sad
and
sober
earnest
and
could
not
relish
nor
even
take
in
alfred
irony
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
hardie
in
the
face
you
be
a
hard
man
said
he
trembling
with
emotion
you
robbed
me
and
my
missus
of
our
all
you
ha
broke
her
heart
and
turned
my
head
and
if
i
was
to
come
and
kill
only
be
clearing
scores
of
that
i
comes
to
you
like
a
lamb
and
says
give
me
your
name
on
a
bit
of
paper
and
put
me
out
of
harm
way
says
you
to
the
workhouse
be
in
the
workhouse
you
that
owes
me
nine
hundred
pounds
and
my
dead
missus
with
this
he
went
into
a
rage
took
a
packet
out
of
his
pocket
and
flung
of
hardie
paper
at
hardie
head
before
any
one
could
stop
him
but
alfred
saw
his
game
stepped
forward
and
caught
it
with
one
hand
and
with
the
dexterity
of
a
within
a
foot
of
his
nose
how
that
umpire
said
he
then
a
little
sternly
do
do
that
again
maxley
or
i
shall
have
to
give
you
a
hiding
to
keep
up
he
then
put
the
notes
in
his
pocket
and
said
quietly
shall
give
you
your
money
for
these
before
the
year
you
wo
be
quite
so
mad
as
that
i
hope
remonstrated
his
father
but
he
made
no
reply
they
very
seldom
answered
one
another
now
oh
said
wycherley
inspecting
him
like
a
human
curiosity
nullum
magnum
ingenium
sine
mixtura
nec
parvum
sine
mixtura
stultitiae
retorted
alfred
in
a
moment
and
met
his
offensive
gaze
with
a
look
of
supercilious
disdain
then
having
shut
him
up
he
turned
to
osmond
come
said
he
prescribe
for
this
poor
fellow
who
asks
for
a
hospital
so
routine
gives
him
a
workhouse
come
you
know
there
is
no
limit
to
your
skill
and
good
nature
you
cured
spot
of
the
worms
cure
poor
old
maxley
of
his
snakes
oblige
that
i
will
alfred
said
osmond
heartily
and
wrote
a
prescription
on
a
leaf
of
his
remarking
that
though
a
simple
purgative
it
had
made
short
work
of
a
great
many
serpents
and
dragons
and
not
a
few
spectres
and
hobgoblins
into
the
bargain
the
young
gentleman
thanked
him
graciously
and
said
kindly
to
maxley
get
that
made
up
here
a
guinea
and
i
send
somebody
to
see
how
you
are
the
poor
man
took
the
guinea
and
the
prescription
and
his
head
drooped
again
and
he
slouched
away
wycherley
remarked
significantly
that
his
conduct
was
worth
imitating
by
persons
similarly
situated
and
concluded
oracularly
prophylaxis
is
preferable
to
or
as
would
say
is
better
than
cure
with
this
parting
blow
the
oxonian
suddenly
sauntered
away
unconscious
it
seemed
of
the
existence
of
his
companions
i
never
saw
a
plainer
case
of
incubation
remarked
wycherley
with
vast
benevolence
of
manner
maxley
oh
no
that
is
parochial
it
is
your
profoundly
interesting
son
i
alluded
to
did
you
notice
his
supercilious
departure
his
morbid
celerity
of
repartee
hardie
replied
with
some
little
hesitation
yes
and
excuse
me
i
thought
he
had
rather
the
best
of
the
battle
with
indubitably
so
replied
wycherley
they
always
do
at
least
such
is
my
experience
if
ever
i
break
a
lance
of
wit
with
an
incubator
i
calculate
with
confidence
on
being
unhorsed
with
abnormal
rapidity
and
rare
indeed
are
the
instances
in
which
my
anticipations
are
not
promptly
and
fully
realised
by
a
similar
rule
of
progression
the
incubator
is
seldom
a
match
for
the
confirmed
maniac
either
in
the
light
play
of
sarcasm
the
coruscations
of
wit
or
the
severer
encounters
of
dialectical
dear
dear
dear
then
how
is
one
to
know
a
genius
from
a
madman
inquired
jane
by
sending
for
a
psychological
if
i
understand
the
doctor
right
the
two
things
are
not
opposed
remarked
hardie
wycherley
assented
and
made
a
remarkable
statement
in
confirmation
one
half
of
the
aggregate
of
the
genius
of
the
country
is
at
present
under
restraint
fortunately
for
the
community
and
still
more
fortunately
for
he
then
put
on
his
gloves
and
with
much
kindness
but
solemnity
warned
hardie
not
to
neglect
his
son
case
nor
to
suppose
that
matters
could
go
on
like
this
without
disintegrating
or
disorganising
the
grey
matter
of
the
brain
i
admit
said
he
that
in
some
recorded
cases
of
insanity
the
brain
on
dissection
has
revealed
no
signs
of
structural
or
functional
derangement
and
that
on
the
other
hand
considerable
encephalic
disorganisation
has
been
shown
to
have
existed
in
other
cases
without
aberration
or
impairment
of
the
reason
but
such
phenomena
are
to
be
considered
as
pathological
curiosities
with
which
the
empiric
would
fain
endeavour
to
disturb
the
sound
general
conclusions
of
science
the
only
safe
mode
of
reasoning
on
matters
so
delicate
and
profound
is
priori
and
as
it
may
safely
be
assumed
as
a
proposition
that
disturbed
intelligence
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
brain
as
disordered
respiration
does
to
the
lungs
it
is
not
logical
reasoning
priori
to
assume
the
possibility
that
the
studious
or
other
mental
habits
of
a
kephalalgic
and
gifted
youth
can
be
reversed
and
erotic
monomania
germinate
with
all
the
morbid
phenomena
of
isolation
dejection
of
the
spirits
and
abnormal
exaltation
of
the
powers
of
wit
and
ratiocination
without
some
considerable
impairment
derangement
disturbance
or
modification
of
the
psychical
motorial
and
sensorial
functions
of
the
great
cerebral
ganglion
but
it
would
be
equally
absurd
to
presuppose
that
these
several
functions
can
be
disarranged
for
months
without
more
or
less
disorganisation
of
the
medullary
or
even
of
the
cineritious
matter
of
the
encephialon
dissection
of
your
talented
son
would
doubtless
reveal
at
this
moment
either
steatonatous
or
atheromatous
deposits
in
the
cerebral
or
an
encysted
abscess
probably
of
no
very
recent
origin
or
at
the
least
considerable
inspissation
and
opacity
of
the
membranes
of
the
encephalon
or
more
or
less
pulpy
disorganisation
of
one
or
other
of
the
hemispheres
of
the
brain
morning
good
morning
sir
and
a
thousand
thanks
for
your
friemidly
interest
in
my
unhappy
the
took
their
departure
for
went
away
and
left
jane
hardie
brimful
of
anxiety
alfred
was
not
there
to
dispose
of
the
tirade
in
two
words
petitio
principii
and
so
smoke
on
and
not
being
an
university
woman
she
could
not
keep
her
eye
on
the
original
assumption
while
following
the
series
of
inferences
the
learned
doctor
built
so
neatly
story
by
story
on
the
foundation
the
quicksand
a
loose
conjecture
so
novices
sitting
at
a
conjuror
see
him
take
a
ring
and
put
it
in
a
little
box
before
a
lady
then
cross
the
theatre
with
another
little
box
and
put
that
before
another
lady
hey
presto
pass
in
box
is
discovered
a
which
is
instantly
to
be
ring
on
this
the
green
minds
are
fixed
and
with
this
is
sham
business
done
box
containing
the
real
ring
all
the
time
is
overlooked
and
the
confederate
in
livery
or
not
does
what
he
likes
with
it
imprisons
it
in
an
orange
for
the
good
of
its
health
so
poor
argan
when
fleurant
enumerates
the
consequences
of
his
omitting
a
single
dose
shall
i
say
is
terrified
by
the
threatened
disorders
which
succeed
to
each
other
logically
enough
all
the
absurdity
being
in
the
first
link
of
the
chain
and
from
that
his
mind
is
now
not
a
word
of
this
to
alfred
said
hardie
i
shall
propose
him
a
little
foreign
tour
to
amuse
his
yes
but
papa
if
some
serious
change
is
really
going
on
inside
his
poor
hardie
smiled
sarcastically
do
you
see
that
if
the
mind
can
wound
the
brain
the
mind
can
cure
it
then
after
a
while
he
said
parentally
my
child
i
must
give
you
a
lesson
men
of
the
world
use
enthusiasts
like
those
two
i
have
just
been
drawing
out
for
their
tools
we
do
let
them
make
tools
of
us
osmond
you
know
is
jackal
to
an
asylum
in
london
wycherley
i
have
heard
keeps
two
or
three
such
establishments
by
himself
or
his
agents
blinded
by
and
that
of
their
clique
what
an
egotistical
world
it
is
to
be
sure
they
would
confine
a
melancholy
youth
in
a
gloomy
house
among
afflicted
persons
and
give
him
nothing
to
do
but
brood
and
so
turn
the
scale
against
his
reason
but
i
have
my
children
interest
at
heart
more
than
my
own
i
shall
send
him
abroad
and
so
amuse
his
mind
with
fresh
objects
break
off
sad
associations
and
restore
him
to
a
brilliant
career
i
count
on
you
to
second
me
in
my
little
scheme
for
his
that
i
will
somehow
i
do
know
why
he
is
coolish
to
he
does
not
understand
you
as
i
do
my
own
but
he
is
affectionate
with
you
i
oh
yes
more
than
ever
trouble
has
drawn
us
closer
papa
in
the
midst
of
our
sorrow
how
much
we
have
to
be
thankful
for
to
the
giver
of
all
good
things
yes
little
angel
and
you
must
improve
heaven
goodness
by
working
on
your
brother
affection
and
persuading
him
to
this
continental
thus
appealed
to
jane
promised
warmly
and
the
man
of
the
world
finding
he
had
a
blind
and
willing
instrument
in
the
one
creature
he
loved
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
and
told
her
to
run
away
for
here
was
skinner
who
no
doubt
wanted
to
speak
on
business
skinner
who
had
in
fact
been
holding
respectfully
aloof
for
some
time
came
forward
on
jane
retiring
and
in
a
very
obsequious
tone
requested
a
private
interview
hardie
led
the
way
into
the
little
they
were
no
sooner
alone
than
skinner
left
off
fawning
very
abruptly
and
put
on
a
rugged
resolute
manner
that
was
new
to
him
i
am
come
for
my
commission
said
he
sturdily
hardie
looked
an
inquiry
oh
you
do
know
what
i
mean
of
course
said
the
little
clerk
almost
brutally
i
waited
and
waited
to
see
if
you
would
have
the
decency
and
the
gratitude
and
the
honesty
to
offer
me
a
trifle
out
of
it
but
i
see
i
might
wait
till
before
you
would
ever
think
of
thinking
of
anybody
but
yourself
so
now
shell
out
without
more
words
or
i
blow
the
gaff
the
little
wretch
raised
his
voice
louder
and
louder
at
every
sentence
hush
hush
skinner
said
hardie
anxiously
you
are
under
some
delusion
when
did
ever
i
decline
to
recognise
your
services
i
always
intended
to
make
you
a
present
a
handsome
then
why
did
ye
it
without
being
forced
come
sir
you
draw
the
wool
over
noah
skinner
eyes
i
have
had
you
watched
and
you
are
looking
towards
the
and
that
is
too
big
a
country
for
me
to
hunt
you
in
i
not
to
be
trifled
with
i
not
to
be
palavered
give
me
a
thousand
pounds
of
it
this
moment
or
i
blow
the
whole
concern
and
you
along
with
a
thousand
pounds
now
look
at
that
shrieked
skinner
serves
me
right
for
not
saying
seven
thousand
what
right
have
you
to
a
shilling
of
it
more
than
i
have
if
i
had
the
luck
to
be
a
burglar
pal
instead
of
a
banker
i
should
have
half
give
it
me
this
moment
or
i
go
to
albion
villa
and
have
you
took
up
for
a
thief
as
you
but
i
have
got
it
on
that
a
lie
you
carry
it
where
did
close
to
your
heart
i
can
see
it
bulge
there
job
was
a
patient
man
but
his
patience
went
at
with
this
he
ran
to
the
window
and
threw
it
open
hardie
entreated
him
to
be
calm
i
give
it
you
skinner
said
he
and
with
pleasure
if
you
will
give
me
some
security
that
you
will
not
turn
round
as
soon
as
you
have
got
it
and
be
my
enemy
of
a
gent
that
pays
me
a
thousand
pounds
nonsense
why
should
i
we
are
in
the
same
boat
behave
like
a
man
and
you
know
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
but
i
will
not
go
halves
in
a
theft
for
nothing
would
come
how
is
it
to
be
peace
or
war
will
you
be
content
with
thirteen
thousand
pounds
that
do
belong
to
you
not
a
shilling
of
it
or
will
you
go
to
jail
a
felon
and
lose
it
every
penny
hardie
groaned
aloud
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
skinner
was
on
sale
and
be
bought
he
took
out
two
notes
for
five
hundred
pounds
each
and
laid
them
on
the
table
after
taking
their
numbers
skinner
eyes
glistened
thank
you
sir
said
he
he
put
them
in
his
pocket
then
he
said
quietly
now
you
have
taken
the
numbers
sir
so
i
trouble
you
for
a
line
to
make
me
safe
against
the
criminal
law
you
are
a
deep
one
you
might
say
i
robbed
that
is
a
very
unworthy
suspicion
skinner
and
a
childish
oh
it
is
diamond
cut
diamond
a
single
line
sir
just
to
say
that
in
return
for
his
faithful
services
you
have
given
noah
skinner
two
notes
for
nos
and
with
all
my
heart
on
your
giving
me
a
receipt
for
it
was
skinner
turn
to
hesitate
after
reflecting
however
on
all
the
possible
consequences
he
saw
nothing
to
fear
so
he
consented
the
business
completed
a
magic
change
took
place
in
the
little
clerk
now
we
are
friends
again
sir
and
i
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
mind
your
eye
with
alfred
he
is
down
on
what
do
you
mean
inquired
hardie
with
anxiety
i
tell
you
sir
he
met
me
this
morning
and
says
he
to
me
old
boy
i
want
to
speak
a
word
to
you
he
puts
his
hands
on
my
shoulder
and
turns
me
round
and
says
he
all
at
one
time
fourteen
thousand
pounds
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
and
he
looked
me
through
like
a
gimlet
mind
ye
now
says
he
see
i
know
all
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
so
then
i
saw
he
did
know
and
i
brazened
up
a
bit
told
him
i
had
a
notion
what
he
meant
yes
i
did
he
said
dodd
fourteen
thousand
pounds
it
had
passed
through
my
hands
then
i
began
to
funk
again
at
his
knowing
that
perhaps
he
only
guessed
it
after
all
but
at
the
time
i
thought
he
knew
it
i
was
flustered
ye
see
but
i
said
look
at
the
books
but
i
did
think
his
deposit
was
anything
like
that
little
equivocating
humbug
says
he
which
was
better
to
tell
the
truths
at
once
and
let
captain
dodd
who
never
did
me
any
harm
have
his
own
or
to
hear
it
told
me
in
the
felon
dock
those
were
his
words
sir
and
they
made
my
blood
run
cold
and
if
he
had
gone
on
at
me
like
that
i
should
have
split
i
know
i
should
but
he
just
said
your
face
has
given
your
tongue
the
lie
you
brains
enough
to
play
the
rogue
oh
and
another
thing
he
said
he
would
talk
to
the
any
more
when
there
was
the
kite
hard
by
so
by
that
i
guess
your
turn
is
coming
sir
so
mind
your
eye
and
then
he
turned
his
back
on
me
with
a
look
as
if
i
was
so
much
dirt
but
i
did
mind
that
i
was
glad
to
be
shut
of
him
at
any
this
intelligence
discomposed
hardie
terribly
it
did
away
with
all
hope
that
alfred
meant
to
keep
his
suspicions
to
himself
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
before
said
he
reproachfully
skinner
sharp
visage
seemed
to
sharpen
as
he
replied
because
i
wanted
a
thousand
pounds
curse
your
low
cunning
skinner
laughed
sir
take
care
of
yourself
and
i
take
care
of
mine
i
afraid
of
alfred
and
the
stone
jug
so
i
off
to
london
and
there
i
myself
into
something
or
other
and
make
my
thousand
pounds
breed
and
he
whipped
out
leaving
his
master
filled
with
rage
and
dismay
outwitted
even
by
this
little
wretch
he
was
now
accountable
for
fourteen
thousand
pounds
and
had
only
thirteen
thousand
left
if
forced
to
reimburse
so
that
it
was
quite
on
the
cards
for
him
to
lose
a
thousand
pounds
by
robbing
his
neighbour
and
risking
his
own
immortal
jewel
this
galled
him
to
the
quick
and
altogether
his
equable
temper
began
to
give
way
it
had
already
survived
half
the
iron
of
his
nerves
he
walked
up
and
down
the
parlour
chafing
like
an
irritated
lion
in
which
state
of
his
mind
the
one
enemy
he
now
feared
and
hated
walked
quietly
into
the
room
and
begged
for
a
little
serious
conversation
with
him
it
is
like
your
effrontery
said
hardie
i
wonder
you
are
not
ashamed
to
look
your
father
in
the
having
wronged
nobody
i
can
look
anybody
in
the
face
replied
alfred
looking
him
in
the
face
at
this
swift
rejoinder
hardie
felt
like
a
too
confident
swordsman
who
attacking
in
a
passion
suddenly
receives
a
prick
that
shows
him
his
antagonist
is
not
one
to
be
trifled
with
he
was
on
his
guard
directly
and
said
coldly
you
have
been
belying
me
to
my
very
no
sir
you
are
mistaken
i
have
never
mentioned
your
name
to
your
hardie
reflected
on
what
skinner
had
told
him
and
found
he
had
made
another
false
move
he
tried
again
nor
to
the
dodds
with
an
incredulous
sneer
nor
to
the
dodds
replied
alfred
calmly
what
not
to
miss
julia
dodd
no
sir
i
have
seen
her
but
once
since
i
discovered
about
the
fourteen
thousand
what
fourteen
thousand
pounds
inquired
hardie
innocently
what
fourteen
thousand
pounds
repeated
the
young
man
disdainfully
then
suddenly
turning
on
his
father
with
red
brow
and
flashing
eyes
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
captain
dodd
brought
home
from
india
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
i
heard
him
claim
of
you
with
curses
ay
miserable
son
and
miserable
man
that
i
am
i
heard
my
own
father
called
a
villain
and
what
did
my
father
reply
did
you
hurl
the
words
back
into
your
accuser
throat
no
you
whispered
hush
bring
it
you
down
oh
what
a
hell
shame
is
hardie
turned
pale
and
almost
sick
with
these
words
of
fled
all
hope
of
ever
deceiving
him
there
there
said
the
young
man
lowering
his
voice
from
rage
to
profound
sorrow
i
do
come
here
to
quarrel
with
my
father
nor
to
insult
him
god
knows
and
i
entreat
you
for
both
our
sakes
not
to
try
my
temper
too
hard
by
these
childish
attempts
to
blind
me
and
sir
pray
dismiss
from
your
mind
the
notion
that
i
have
disclosed
to
any
living
soul
my
knowledge
of
this
horrible
secret
on
the
contrary
i
have
kept
it
gnawing
my
heart
and
almost
maddening
me
at
times
for
my
own
personal
satisfaction
i
have
applied
a
test
both
to
you
and
skinner
but
that
is
all
i
have
done
i
have
not
told
dear
julia
nor
any
of
her
family
and
now
if
you
will
only
listen
to
me
and
do
what
i
entreat
you
to
do
she
shall
never
know
oh
oho
thought
hardie
he
comes
with
a
proposal
i
hear
it
he
then
took
a
line
well
known
to
artful
men
he
encouraged
alfred
to
show
his
hand
maintaining
a
complete
reserve
as
to
his
own
you
say
you
did
not
communicate
your
illusion
about
this
fourteen
thousand
pounds
to
julia
dodd
that
night
may
i
ask
then
without
indiscretion
what
did
pass
between
you
two
i
will
tell
you
sir
she
saw
me
standing
there
and
asked
me
in
her
own
soft
angel
voice
if
i
was
unhappy
i
told
her
i
must
be
a
poor
creature
if
i
could
be
happy
then
she
asked
me
with
some
hesitation
i
thought
why
i
was
unhappy
i
said
because
i
could
not
see
the
path
of
honour
and
duty
clear
that
at
least
was
the
purport
then
she
told
me
that
in
all
difficulties
she
had
found
the
best
way
was
to
pray
to
god
to
guide
her
and
she
begged
me
to
lay
my
care
before
him
and
ask
his
counsel
and
then
i
thanked
her
and
bade
her
and
she
me
and
that
was
all
that
passed
between
us
two
unhappy
lovers
whom
you
have
made
miserable
and
even
cool
to
one
another
but
not
hostile
to
you
and
you
played
the
spy
on
us
sir
and
misunderstood
us
as
spies
generally
do
ah
sir
a
few
months
ago
you
would
not
have
condescended
to
hardie
coloured
but
did
not
reply
he
had
passed
from
the
irritable
into
the
quietly
vindictive
stage
alfred
then
deprecated
further
discussion
of
what
was
past
and
said
abruptly
i
have
an
offer
to
make
you
in
a
very
short
time
i
shall
have
ten
thousand
pounds
i
will
not
resign
my
whole
fortune
that
would
be
unjust
to
myself
and
my
wife
and
i
loathe
and
despise
injustice
in
all
its
forms
however
romantic
or
plausible
but
if
you
will
give
the
dodds
their
i
will
share
my
little
fortune
equally
with
you
and
thank
you
and
bless
you
consider
sir
with
your
abilities
and
experience
five
thousand
pounds
may
yet
be
the
nucleus
of
a
fortune
a
fortune
built
on
an
honourable
foundation
i
know
you
will
thrive
with
my
five
thousand
pounds
ten
times
more
than
with
their
fourteen
thousand
and
enjoy
the
blessing
of
blessings
a
clear
now
this
offer
was
no
sooner
made
than
hardie
shut
his
face
and
went
to
mental
arithmetic
like
one
doing
a
sum
behind
a
thick
door
he
would
have
taken
ten
thousand
but
five
thousand
did
not
much
tempt
him
besides
would
it
be
five
thousand
clear
he
already
owed
alfred
two
thousand
five
hundred
it
flashed
through
him
that
a
young
man
who
loathed
and
despised
injustice
even
to
himself
would
not
consent
to
be
diddled
by
him
out
of
one
sum
while
making
him
a
present
of
another
and
then
there
was
skinner
thousand
to
be
reimbursed
he
therefore
declined
in
these
terms
this
offer
shows
me
you
are
sincere
in
these
strange
notions
you
have
taken
up
i
am
sorry
for
it
it
looks
like
insanity
these
nocturnal
illusions
these
imaginary
sights
and
sounds
come
of
brooding
on
a
single
idea
and
often
usher
in
a
calamity
one
trembles
to
think
of
you
have
made
me
a
proposal
i
make
you
one
take
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
i
get
it
from
your
trustees
and
travel
the
continent
for
four
months
enlarge
and
amuse
your
mind
with
the
contemplation
of
nature
and
manners
and
customs
and
if
that
does
not
clear
this
phantom
out
of
your
head
i
am
much
alfred
replied
that
foreign
travel
was
his
dream
but
he
could
not
leave
barkington
while
there
was
an
act
of
justice
to
be
done
then
do
me
justice
boy
said
hardie
with
wonderful
dignity
all
things
considered
instead
of
brooding
on
your
one
fantastical
idea
and
shutting
out
all
rational
evidence
to
the
contrary
take
the
trouble
to
look
through
my
books
and
they
will
reveal
to
you
a
fortune
not
of
fourteen
thousand
but
of
eighty
thousand
pounds
honourably
sacrificed
in
the
vain
struggle
to
fulfil
my
engagements
who
do
you
think
will
believe
against
such
evidence
the
preposterous
tale
you
have
concocted
against
your
poor
father
already
the
tide
is
turning
and
all
who
have
seen
the
accounts
of
the
bank
pity
me
they
will
pity
me
still
more
if
ever
they
hear
my
own
flesh
and
blood
insults
me
in
the
moment
of
my
fall
sees
me
ruined
by
my
honesty
and
living
in
a
hovel
yet
comes
into
that
poor
but
honest
abode
and
stabs
me
to
the
heart
by
accusing
me
of
stealing
fourteen
thousand
pounds
a
sum
that
would
have
saved
me
if
i
could
only
have
laid
my
hands
on
he
hid
his
face
to
conceal
its
incongruous
expression
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
alfred
turned
his
head
away
and
groaned
after
a
while
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
went
to
the
door
but
seemed
reluctant
to
go
he
cast
a
longing
lingering
look
on
his
father
and
said
beseechingly
oh
think
you
are
not
my
flesh
and
blood
more
than
i
am
yours
is
all
the
love
to
be
on
my
side
have
i
no
influence
even
when
right
is
on
my
side
then
he
suddenly
turned
and
threw
himself
impetuously
on
his
knees
your
father
was
the
soul
of
honour
your
son
loathed
fraud
and
injustice
from
his
cradle
you
stand
between
two
generations
of
hardies
and
belong
to
neither
do
but
reflect
one
moment
how
bright
a
thing
honour
is
how
short
and
uncertain
a
thing
life
is
how
sure
a
thing
retribution
is
in
this
world
or
the
next
it
is
your
guardian
angel
that
kneels
before
you
now
and
not
your
son
oh
for
christ
sake
for
my
mother
sake
listen
to
my
last
appeal
you
know
me
i
can
not
compound
with
injustice
pity
me
pity
her
i
love
pity
yourself
you
young
viper
cried
the
father
stung
with
remorse
but
not
touched
with
penitence
get
away
you
amorous
young
hypocrite
get
out
of
my
house
get
out
of
my
sight
or
i
shall
spurn
you
and
curse
you
at
my
enough
said
alfred
rising
and
turning
suddenly
calm
as
a
statue
let
us
be
gentlemen
if
you
please
even
though
we
must
be
enemies
my
father
that
and
he
walked
gently
out
of
the
room
and
as
he
passed
the
window
hardie
heard
his
great
heart
sob
he
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
a
hard
tussle
thought
he
and
with
my
own
unnatural
ungrateful
flesh
and
blood
but
i
have
won
it
he
has
told
the
dodds
he
never
will
and
if
he
did
who
would
believe
him
or
them
at
dinner
there
was
no
alfred
but
after
dinner
a
note
to
jane
informing
her
he
had
taken
lodgings
in
the
town
and
requesting
her
to
send
his
books
and
clothes
in
the
evening
jane
handed
the
note
to
her
father
and
sighed
deeply
watching
his
face
as
he
read
it
she
saw
him
turn
rather
pale
and
look
more
furrowed
than
ever
papa
said
she
what
it
all
mean
i
am
then
after
a
long
pause
he
ground
his
teeth
and
said
it
means
war
war
between
my
own
son
and
chapter
xxvi
long
before
this
open
rupture
jane
hardie
had
asked
her
father
sorrowfully
whether
she
was
to
discontinue
her
intimacy
with
the
dodds
she
thought
of
course
he
would
say
yes
and
it
cost
her
a
hard
struggle
between
inclination
and
filial
duty
to
raise
the
question
but
hardie
was
anxious
her
friendship
with
that
family
should
continue
it
furnished
a
channel
of
news
and
in
case
of
detection
might
be
useful
to
avert
or
soften
hostilities
so
he
answered
rather
sharply
on
no
account
the
dodds
are
an
estimable
family
pray
be
as
friendly
with
them
as
ever
you
jane
coloured
with
pleasure
at
this
most
unexpected
reply
but
her
wakeful
conscience
reminded
her
this
answer
was
given
in
ignorance
of
her
attachment
to
edward
dodd
and
urged
her
to
confession
but
at
that
nature
recoiled
edward
had
not
openly
declared
his
love
to
her
so
modest
pride
as
well
as
modest
shame
combined
with
female
cowardice
to
hold
back
the
avowal
so
then
miss
tender
conscience
tormented
herself
and
recorded
the
struggle
in
her
diary
but
briefly
and
in
terms
vague
and
typical
not
a
word
about
a
young
man
or
crossed
in
love
but
one
obscure
and
hasty
slap
at
the
carnal
affections
and
a
good
deal
about
the
saints
in
prison
and
the
battle
of
yet
to
do
her
justice
laxity
of
expression
did
not
act
upon
her
conduct
and
warp
that
as
it
does
most
mystical
speakers
to
obey
her
father
to
the
letter
she
maintained
a
friendly
correspondence
with
julia
dodd
exchanging
letters
daily
but
not
to
disobey
him
in
the
spirit
she
ceased
to
visit
albion
villa
thus
she
avoided
edward
and
extracted
from
the
situation
the
utmost
and
the
least
possible
amount
of
carnal
pleasure
as
she
naively
denominated
an
interchange
of
worldly
affection
however
distant
and
respectful
one
day
she
happened
to
mention
her
diary
and
say
it
was
a
present
comfort
to
her
and
instructive
to
review
julia
catching
at
every
straw
of
consolation
said
she
would
keep
one
too
and
asked
a
sight
of
jane
for
a
model
no
dear
friend
said
jane
a
diary
should
be
one
self
on
this
was
fortunate
it
precluded
that
servile
imitation
in
which
her
sex
excels
even
mine
and
consequently
the
two
records
reflect
two
good
girls
instead
of
one
in
two
skins
and
may
be
trusted
to
conduct
this
narrative
forward
and
relieve
its
monotony
a
little
only
of
course
the
reader
must
not
expect
to
see
the
plot
of
a
story
carried
minutely
out
in
two
crude
compositions
written
with
an
object
so
distinct
he
must
watch
for
glimpses
and
make
the
most
of
indications
nor
is
this
an
excessive
demand
upon
his
intelligence
for
if
he
can
not
do
this
with
a
book
how
will
he
do
it
in
real
life
where
male
and
female
characters
reveal
their
true
selves
by
glimpses
only
and
the
gravest
and
most
dramatic
events
give
the
diviner
so
few
and
faint
signs
of
their
coming
from
julia
dodd
dec
it
is
all
over
they
have
taken
papa
away
to
an
asylum
and
the
house
is
like
a
grave
but
for
our
outbursts
of
sorrow
just
before
he
went
away
the
medal
came
oh
no
i
can
not
poor
poor
mamma
in
the
midst
of
our
affliction
heaven
sent
us
a
ray
of
comfort
the
kindest
letter
from
a
lady
a
perfect
stranger
it
came
yesterday
but
now
i
have
got
it
to
copy
oh
bless
it
and
the
good
kind
madam
i
scarcely
know
whether
to
hope
or
to
fear
that
your
good
husband
may
have
mentioned
my
name
to
you
however
he
is
just
the
man
to
pass
over
both
my
misbehaviour
and
his
own
gallantry
so
i
beg
permission
to
introduce
myself
i
and
my
little
boy
were
passengers
by
the
i
was
spoiled
by
a
long
residence
in
india
and
gave
your
husband
sore
trouble
by
resisting
discipline
refusing
to
put
out
my
light
at
nine
and
in
short
by
being
an
unreasonable
woman
or
rather
a
spoiled
child
well
all
my
little
attempts
at
a
feud
failed
captain
dodd
did
his
duty
and
kept
his
temper
provokingly
the
only
revenge
he
took
was
a
noble
one
he
jumped
into
the
sea
after
my
darling
freddy
and
saved
him
from
a
watery
grave
and
his
mother
from
madness
or
death
yet
he
was
himself
hardly
recovered
from
a
wound
he
had
received
in
defending
us
all
against
pirates
need
i
say
more
to
one
who
is
herself
a
mother
you
will
know
how
our
little
misunderstanding
ended
after
that
as
soon
as
we
were
friends
i
made
him
talk
of
his
family
yourself
edward
julia
i
seem
to
know
you
all
the
ruffian
who
succeeded
our
good
captain
had
wrecked
poor
us
and
then
deserted
us
your
husband
resumed
the
command
and
saved
freddy
and
me
once
more
by
his
courage
his
wonderful
coolness
and
his
skill
since
then
the
mouse
has
been
at
work
for
the
lion
i
despair
of
conveying
any
pleasure
by
it
to
a
character
so
elevated
as
captain
dodd
his
reward
must
be
his
own
conscience
but
we
poor
little
women
like
external
shows
do
we
not
and
so
i
thought
a
medal
of
the
humane
society
might
give
some
pleasure
to
you
and
miss
dodd
never
did
medal
nor
order
repose
on
a
nobler
heart
the
case
was
so
strong
and
so
well
supported
that
the
society
did
not
hesitate
and
you
will
receive
it
very
soon
after
this
will
be
surprised
dear
madam
at
all
this
from
a
stranger
to
yourself
and
will
perhaps
set
it
down
to
a
wish
to
intrude
on
your
acquaintance
well
then
dear
madam
you
will
not
be
far
wrong
i
like
much
to
know
one
whose
character
i
already
seem
acquainted
with
and
to
convey
personally
my
gratitude
and
admiration
of
your
husband
i
could
pour
it
out
more
freely
to
you
you
know
than
to
i
am
dear
madam
yours
very
faithfully
beresford
and
the
medal
came
about
an
hour
before
the
fly
to
take
him
away
his
dear
name
was
on
it
and
his
brave
courageous
acts
oh
shall
i
ever
be
old
enough
and
hard
enough
to
speak
of
this
without
stopping
to
cry
we
fastened
it
round
his
dear
neck
with
a
ribbon
mamma
would
put
it
inside
his
clothes
for
fear
the
silver
should
tempt
some
wretch
i
should
never
have
thought
of
that
is
there
a
creature
so
base
and
we
told
the
men
how
he
had
gained
it
they
were
servants
of
the
asylum
and
we
showed
them
how
brave
and
good
he
was
and
would
be
again
if
they
would
be
kind
to
him
and
cure
him
and
mamma
bribed
them
with
money
to
use
him
kindly
i
thought
they
would
be
offended
and
refuse
it
but
they
took
it
and
their
faces
showed
she
was
wiser
than
i
am
keeps
away
from
us
too
it
is
nearly
a
fortnight
dec
aunt
eve
left
mamma
kept
her
room
and
could
not
speak
to
her
can
not
forgive
her
interfering
between
papa
and
her
it
does
seem
strange
that
any
one
but
mamma
should
be
able
to
send
papa
out
of
the
house
and
to
such
a
place
but
it
is
the
law
and
edward
who
is
all
good
sense
says
it
was
necessary
he
says
mamma
is
unjust
grief
makes
her
unreasonable
i
do
know
who
is
in
the
right
and
i
much
care
but
i
know
i
am
sorry
for
aunt
eve
and
very
very
sorry
for
dec
i
am
an
egotist
found
myself
out
this
morning
and
it
is
a
good
thing
to
keep
a
diary
was
overpowered
at
first
by
grief
for
mamma
but
now
the
house
is
sad
and
quiet
i
am
always
thinking
of
and
that
is
egotism
egotism
the
abstract
quality
evolved
from
the
concrete
term
egotist
by
feminine
art
without
the
aid
of
grammar
why
he
stay
away
so
i
almost
wish
i
could
think
it
was
coldness
or
diminished
affection
for
i
fear
something
worse
something
to
make
wretched
those
dreadful
words
papa
spoke
before
he
was
afflicted
words
i
will
never
put
on
paper
but
they
ring
in
my
ears
still
they
appal
me
and
then
found
at
their
very
door
ah
and
i
knew
i
find
him
near
that
house
and
now
keeps
dec
all
day
trying
to
comfort
mamma
she
made
a
great
effort
and
wrote
to
poor
mamma
letter
dear
madam
your
kind
and
valued
letter
reached
us
in
deep
affliction
and
i
am
little
able
to
reply
to
you
as
you
deserve
my
poor
husband
is
very
ill
so
ill
that
he
no
longer
remembers
the
past
neither
the
brave
acts
that
have
won
him
your
esteem
nor
even
the
face
of
his
loving
and
unhappy
wife
who
now
thanks
you
with
many
tears
for
your
sweet
letter
as
my
children
and
i
are
we
yet
derive
some
consolation
from
it
we
have
tied
the
medal
round
his
neck
madam
and
thank
you
far
more
than
we
can
find
words
to
express
in
conclusion
i
pray
heaven
that
in
your
bitterest
hour
you
may
find
the
consolation
you
have
administered
to
us
no
no
i
pray
you
may
never
never
stand
in
such
need
of
comfort
i
am
dear
madam
yours
gratefully
and
sincerely
lucy
dec
at
anne
in
the
morning
tried
hard
to
apply
the
sermon
he
spoke
of
griefs
but
coldly
surely
he
never
felt
one
was
not
there
mem
always
pray
against
wandering
thoughts
on
entering
dec
a
diary
is
a
dreadful
thing
everything
must
go
down
now
and
amongst
the
rest
that
the
poor
are
selfish
i
could
not
interest
one
of
mine
in
mamma
sorrows
no
they
must
run
back
to
their
own
little
sordid
troubles
about
money
and
things
i
was
so
provoked
with
jackson
she
owes
mamma
so
much
that
i
left
her
hastily
and
that
was
impatience
i
had
a
mind
to
go
back
to
her
but
would
not
and
that
was
pride
where
is
my
christianity
a
kind
letter
from
jane
hardie
but
no
word
of
dec
edward
told
me
plump
i
must
not
go
on
taking
things
out
of
the
house
for
the
poor
mamma
gave
me
the
reason
are
poor
ourselves
thanks
to
and
then
she
stopped
does
she
suspect
how
can
she
she
did
hear
not
those
two
dreadful
words
of
papa
they
are
like
two
arrows
in
my
heart
and
so
we
are
poor
she
says
we
have
scarcely
anything
to
live
upon
after
paying
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
for
dec
a
comforting
letter
from
jane
she
sends
me
hebrews
xii
and
says
us
take
a
part
of
the
bible
and
read
two
chapters
prayerfully
at
the
same
hour
of
the
day
will
ten
in
the
morning
suit
you
and
if
so
will
you
choose
where
to
begin
i
will
sweet
friend
i
will
and
then
though
some
cruel
mystery
keeps
us
apart
our
souls
will
be
together
over
the
sacred
page
as
i
hope
they
will
one
day
be
together
in
heaven
yours
will
at
any
rate
wrote
back
yes
and
a
thousand
thanks
and
should
like
to
begin
with
the
psalms
they
are
sorrowful
and
so
are
we
and
i
must
pray
not
to
think
too
much
of
if
everything
is
to
be
put
down
one
does
i
cried
long
and
bitterly
to
find
i
had
written
that
i
must
pray
to
god
against
dec
it
is
plain
he
never
means
to
come
again
mamma
says
nothing
but
that
is
out
of
pity
for
me
i
have
not
read
her
dear
face
all
these
years
for
nothing
she
is
beginning
to
think
him
unworthy
when
she
thinks
of
him
at
there
is
a
mystery
a
dreadful
mystery
may
he
not
be
as
mystified
too
and
perhaps
tortured
like
me
with
doubts
and
suspicions
they
say
he
is
pale
and
dejected
poor
thing
but
then
oh
why
not
come
to
me
and
say
so
shall
i
write
to
him
no
i
will
cut
my
hand
off
dec
a
blessed
letter
from
jane
she
says
writing
on
ordinary
subjects
is
a
sad
waste
of
time
and
very
unpardonable
among
his
people
and
so
it
is
and
my
weak
hope
daily
disappointed
that
there
may
be
something
in
her
letter
only
shows
how
inferior
i
am
to
my
beloved
friend
she
says
should
like
to
fix
another
hour
for
us
two
to
meet
at
the
throne
together
will
five
suit
you
we
dine
at
six
but
i
am
never
more
than
half
an
hour
dressing
the
friendship
of
this
saint
and
her
bright
example
is
what
heaven
sends
me
in
infinite
mercy
and
goodness
to
sooth
my
aching
heart
a
little
for
i
shall
never
see
again
i
have
seen
him
this
very
it
was
a
beautiful
night
i
went
to
look
at
the
world
to
come
i
call
it
for
i
believe
the
redeemed
are
to
inhabit
those
very
stars
hereafter
and
visit
them
all
in
turn
and
this
world
i
now
find
is
a
world
of
sorrow
and
disappointment
so
i
went
on
the
balcony
to
look
at
a
better
one
and
oh
it
seemed
so
holy
so
calm
so
pure
that
heavenly
world
i
gazed
and
stretched
my
hands
towards
it
for
ever
so
little
of
its
holiness
and
purity
and
that
moment
i
heard
a
sigh
i
looked
and
there
stood
a
gentleman
just
outside
our
gate
and
it
was
i
nearly
screamed
and
my
heart
beat
so
he
did
not
see
me
for
i
had
come
out
softly
and
his
poor
head
was
down
down
upon
his
breast
and
he
used
to
carry
it
so
high
a
little
little
while
ago
too
high
some
said
but
not
i
looked
and
my
misgivings
melted
away
it
flashed
on
me
as
if
one
of
those
stars
had
written
it
with
its
own
light
in
my
heart
stands
grief
not
guilt
and
before
i
knew
what
i
was
about
i
had
whispered
the
poor
boy
started
and
ran
towards
me
but
stopped
short
and
sighed
again
my
heart
yearned
but
it
was
not
for
me
to
make
advances
to
him
after
his
unkindness
so
i
spoke
to
him
as
coldly
as
ever
i
could
and
i
said
are
unhappy
he
looked
up
to
me
and
then
i
saw
even
by
that
light
that
he
is
enduring
a
bitter
bitter
struggle
pale
worn
dragged
now
how
many
times
have
i
cried
this
last
month
more
than
in
all
the
rest
of
my
life
a
great
he
said
must
be
a
contemptible
thing
if
i
was
not
unhappy
and
then
he
asked
me
should
not
i
despise
him
if
he
was
happy
i
did
not
answer
that
but
i
asked
him
why
he
was
unhappy
and
when
i
had
i
was
half
frightened
for
he
never
evades
a
question
the
least
bit
he
held
his
head
higher
still
and
said
am
unhappy
because
i
can
not
see
the
path
of
honour
then
i
babbled
something
i
forget
what
then
he
went
on
like
this
ah
i
never
forget
what
says
he
said
cicero
says
ipsa
lucet
per
se
something
something
else
and
he
repeated
it
slowly
for
me
he
knows
i
know
a
little
latin
and
told
me
that
was
as
much
as
to
say
is
so
clear
a
thing
that
whoever
hesitates
must
be
on
the
road
of
wrong
and
yet
he
said
bitterly
hesitate
and
doubt
in
a
matter
of
right
and
wrong
like
an
academic
philosopher
weighing
and
balancing
mere
speculative
straws
those
were
his
very
words
so
said
he
am
miserable
deserving
to
be
miserable
cogitationem
significat
injuriae
then
i
ventured
to
remind
him
that
he
and
i
and
all
christian
souls
had
a
resource
not
known
to
heathen
philosophers
however
able
and
i
said
alfred
when
i
am
in
doubt
and
difficulty
i
go
and
pray
to
him
to
guide
me
aright
have
you
done
so
no
that
had
never
occurred
to
him
but
he
would
if
i
made
a
point
of
it
and
at
any
rate
he
could
not
go
on
in
this
way
i
should
soon
see
him
again
and
once
his
mind
was
made
up
no
shrinking
from
mere
consequences
he
promised
me
then
we
bade
one
another
good
night
and
he
went
off
holding
his
head
as
proudly
as
he
used
and
poor
silly
me
fluttered
and
nearly
hysterical
as
soon
as
i
quite
lost
sight
of
dec
at
church
in
the
morning
a
good
sermon
notes
and
analysis
in
the
evening
jane
clergyman
preached
she
came
going
out
i
asked
her
a
question
about
what
we
had
heard
but
she
did
not
answer
me
at
parting
she
told
me
she
made
it
a
rule
not
to
speak
coming
from
church
not
even
about
the
sermon
this
seemed
austere
to
poor
me
but
of
course
she
is
right
oh
that
i
was
like
dec
edward
is
coming
out
this
boy
that
one
has
taught
all
the
french
all
the
dancing
and
nearly
all
the
latin
he
knows
turns
out
to
be
one
superior
infinitely
i
mean
in
practical
good
sense
mamma
had
taken
her
pearls
to
the
jeweller
and
borrowed
two
hundred
pounds
he
found
this
out
and
objected
she
told
him
a
part
of
it
was
required
to
keep
him
at
oxford
indeed
said
he
and
we
thought
of
course
there
was
an
end
but
next
morning
he
was
off
before
breakfast
and
the
day
after
he
returned
from
oxford
with
his
caution
money
forty
pounds
and
gave
it
mamma
she
had
forgotten
all
about
it
and
he
had
taken
his
name
off
the
college
books
and
left
the
university
for
ever
the
poor
gentle
tears
of
mortification
ran
down
his
mother
cheeks
and
i
hung
round
her
neck
and
scolded
him
like
a
vixen
as
i
am
we
might
have
spared
tears
and
fury
both
for
he
is
neither
to
be
melted
nor
irritated
by
poor
little
us
he
kissed
us
and
coaxed
us
like
a
superior
being
and
set
to
work
in
his
quiet
sober
ponderous
way
and
proved
us
a
couple
of
fools
to
our
entire
satisfaction
and
that
without
an
unkind
word
for
he
is
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
as
strong
as
ten
thousand
elephants
he
took
the
money
back
and
brought
the
pearls
home
again
and
he
has
written
de
votre
siecle
in
great
large
letters
and
has
pasted
it
on
all
our
three
doors
inside
and
he
has
been
all
these
years
quietly
cutting
up
the
advertiser
and
arranging
the
slips
with
wonderful
skill
and
method
he
calls
it
the
and
you
ca
ask
for
any
information
great
or
small
but
he
find
you
something
about
it
in
this
digest
such
a
folio
it
takes
a
man
to
open
and
shut
it
and
he
means
to
be
a
sort
of
little
papa
in
this
house
and
mamma
means
to
let
him
and
indeed
it
is
so
sweet
to
be
commanded
besides
it
saves
thinking
for
oneself
and
that
is
such
a
dec
yes
they
have
settled
it
we
are
to
leave
here
and
live
in
lodgings
to
save
servants
how
we
are
to
exist
even
so
mamma
can
not
see
but
edward
can
he
says
we
two
have
got
popular
talents
and
knows
the
what
does
that
mean
i
wonder
and
the
world
in
general
i
asked
him
wherever
he
picked
it
up
his
knowledge
he
said
the
i
asked
him
would
he
leave
the
place
where
lives
he
looked
sad
but
said
for
the
good
of
us
all
so
he
is
better
than
i
am
but
who
is
not
i
wasted
an
imploring
look
on
him
but
not
on
mamma
she
looked
back
to
me
and
then
said
sadly
a
few
days
edward
for
sake
that
meant
for
poor
credulous
julia
who
still
believes
in
him
my
sweet
mother
dec
told
mamma
i
would
go
for
a
governess
to
help
her
since
we
are
all
ruined
she
kissed
me
and
trembled
but
she
did
not
say
so
it
will
come
to
that
he
will
be
sorry
when
i
do
go
i
think
i
shall
find
courage
to
send
him
a
line
just
to
say
i
am
sure
is
not
to
blame
for
withdrawing
indeed
how
could
i
ever
marry
a
man
whose
father
i
have
heard
my
father
call
the
pen
was
drawn
through
the
rest
dec
a
miserable
day
low
spirited
and
hysterical
we
are
really
going
away
edward
has
begun
to
make
i
stood
over
him
and
sighed
and
asked
him
questions
he
said
he
was
going
to
take
unfurnished
rooms
in
london
send
up
what
furniture
is
absolutely
necessary
and
sell
the
rest
by
auction
with
the
lease
of
our
dear
dear
house
where
we
were
all
so
happy
once
so
what
with
his
of
the
markets
and
the
world
and
his
sense
and
his
strong
will
we
have
only
to
submit
and
then
he
is
so
kind
too
cry
little
girl
he
said
but
what
i
could
turn
on
the
waters
myself
if
there
was
anything
to
be
gained
by
it
i
cry
ju
said
he
shall
i
whistle
i
think
i
whistle
and
he
whistled
a
tune
right
through
while
he
worked
with
a
heart
as
sick
as
my
own
perhaps
poor
edward
dec
my
christian
friend
has
her
griefs
too
but
then
puts
them
to
profit
she
says
today
are
both
tasting
the
same
but
experience
her
every
word
is
a
rebuke
to
me
torn
at
this
solemn
season
of
the
year
with
earthly
passions
went
down
after
reading
her
letter
and
played
and
sang
the
in
of
pergolesi
with
all
my
soul
so
then
i
repeated
it
and
burst
out
crying
in
the
middle
oh
shame
shame
dec
edward
started
for
london
at
five
in
the
morning
to
take
a
place
for
us
the
servants
were
next
told
and
received
warning
the
one
we
had
the
poorest
opinion
of
she
is
such
a
flirt
cried
and
begged
mamma
to
let
her
share
our
fallen
fortunes
and
said
she
could
cook
a
little
and
would
do
her
best
i
kissed
her
violently
and
quite
forgot
i
was
a
young
lady
till
she
herself
reminded
me
and
she
looked
frightened
at
mamma
but
mamma
only
smiled
through
her
tears
and
said
of
it
quietly
sarah
before
you
commit
yourself
i
am
now
sitting
in
my
old
room
cold
as
a
stone
for
i
have
packed
up
some
things
so
the
first
step
is
actually
taken
oh
if
i
but
knew
that
he
was
happy
then
i
could
endure
anything
but
how
can
i
think
so
well
i
will
go
and
never
tell
a
soul
what
i
suspect
and
he
can
not
tell
even
if
he
knows
for
it
is
his
father
jane
too
avoids
all
mention
of
her
own
father
and
brother
more
than
is
natural
oh
if
i
could
only
be
a
child
again
regrets
are
vain
i
will
cease
even
to
record
them
these
diaries
feed
one
selfishness
and
the
unfortunate
passion
that
will
make
me
a
bad
daughter
and
an
ungrateful
soldier
of
him
who
was
born
as
to
your
knees
false
christian
to
your
knees
i
am
calmer
now
and
feel
resigned
to
the
will
of
heaven
or
benumbed
or
something
i
will
pack
this
box
and
then
go
down
and
comfort
my
mother
and
visit
my
poor
people
perhaps
for
the
last
time
ah
me
a
knock
at
the
street
door
his
knock
i
know
every
echo
of
his
hand
and
his
foot
where
is
my
composure
now
i
flutter
like
a
bird
i
will
not
go
down
he
will
think
i
love
him
so
at
least
i
will
wait
till
he
has
nearly
gone
elizabeth
has
come
to
say
i
am
wanted
in
the
so
i
go
down
whether
i
like
or
no
bedtime
oh
that
i
had
the
pen
of
a
writer
to
record
the
scene
i
have
witnessed
worthily
when
i
came
in
i
found
mamma
and
him
both
seated
in
dead
silence
he
rose
and
looked
at
me
and
i
at
him
and
years
seemed
to
have
rolled
over
his
face
since
last
i
saw
it
i
was
obliged
to
turn
my
head
away
i
curtseyed
to
him
distantly
and
may
heaven
forgive
me
for
that
and
we
sat
down
and
presently
turned
round
and
all
looked
at
one
another
like
the
ghosts
of
the
happy
creatures
we
once
were
altogether
then
alfred
began
not
in
his
old
imperative
voice
but
scarce
above
a
whisper
and
oh
the
words
such
as
none
but
himself
in
the
wide
world
would
have
spoken
i
love
him
better
than
ever
i
pity
him
i
adore
him
he
is
a
scholar
he
is
a
chevalier
he
is
the
soul
of
honour
he
is
the
most
unfortunate
and
proudest
gentleman
beneath
the
sun
oh
my
darling
my
darling
he
said
dodd
and
you
miss
dodd
whom
i
loved
before
i
lost
the
right
to
ask
you
to
be
mine
and
whom
i
shall
love
to
the
last
hour
of
my
miserable
existence
i
am
come
to
explain
my
own
conduct
to
you
and
to
do
you
an
act
of
simple
justice
too
long
delayed
to
begin
with
myself
you
must
know
that
my
understanding
is
of
the
academic
school
i
incline
to
weigh
proofs
before
i
make
up
my
mind
but
then
i
differ
from
that
school
in
this
that
i
can
not
think
myself
to
an
eternal
standstill
such
an
expression
but
what
does
that
matter
it
was
i
am
a
man
of
action
in
hamlet
place
i
should
have
either
turned
my
ghost
into
ridicule
or
my
uncle
into
a
ghost
so
i
kept
away
from
you
while
in
doubt
but
now
i
doubt
no
longer
i
take
my
line
ladies
you
have
been
swindled
out
of
a
large
sum
of
money
my
blood
ran
cold
at
these
words
surely
nothing
on
earth
but
a
man
could
say
this
right
out
like
that
mamma
and
i
looked
at
one
another
and
what
did
i
see
in
her
face
for
the
first
time
why
that
she
had
her
suspicions
too
and
had
been
keeping
them
from
me
pitying
angel
he
went
on
dodd
brought
home
several
thousand
pounds
mamma
said
and
i
think
she
was
going
to
say
how
much
but
he
stopped
her
and
made
her
write
the
amount
in
an
envelope
while
he
took
another
and
wrote
in
it
with
his
pencil
he
took
both
envelopes
to
me
and
asked
me
to
read
them
out
in
turn
i
did
and
mamma
said
fourteen
thousand
pounds
and
his
said
fourteen
thousand
pounds
mamma
looked
such
a
look
at
me
then
he
turned
to
me
dodd
do
you
remember
that
night
you
and
i
met
at
richard
hardie
door
well
scarce
five
minutes
before
that
your
father
was
standing
on
our
lawn
and
called
to
the
man
who
was
my
father
in
a
loud
voice
it
rings
in
my
ears
now
hardie
villain
give
me
back
my
money
my
fourteen
thousand
pounds
give
me
my
money
or
may
your
children
die
before
your
ah
you
wince
to
hear
me
whisper
these
dreadful
words
what
if
you
had
been
where
i
was
and
heard
them
spoken
and
in
a
terrible
voice
the
voice
of
despair
the
voice
of
truth
soon
a
window
opened
cautiously
and
a
voice
whispered
hush
i
bring
it
you
and
voice
was
the
voice
of
fear
of
dishonesty
and
of
richard
hardie
he
turned
deadly
white
when
he
said
this
and
i
cried
to
mamma
stop
him
stop
him
and
she
said
think
what
you
are
saying
why
do
you
tell
us
what
we
had
better
never
know
he
answered
directly
it
is
the
truth
and
because
i
loathe
injustice
some
time
afterwards
i
taxed
richard
hardie
with
this
fourteen
thousand
pounds
and
his
face
betrayed
him
i
taxed
his
clerk
skinner
and
skinner
face
betrayed
him
and
he
fled
the
town
that
very
night
my
mother
looked
much
distressed
and
said
what
end
do
you
raise
this
pitiable
subject
your
father
is
a
bankrupt
and
we
but
suffer
with
the
rest
no
said
he
have
looked
through
the
bankrupt
books
and
there
is
no
mention
of
the
sum
and
then
who
brought
captain
dodd
here
skinner
and
skinner
is
his
detected
confederate
it
is
clear
to
me
poor
captain
dodd
trusted
that
sum
to
before
he
had
the
fit
beyond
this
all
is
conjecture
mamma
looked
at
me
again
and
said
am
i
to
do
or
say
screamed
nothing
say
nothing
oh
pray
pray
make
him
hold
his
tongue
and
let
the
vile
money
go
it
is
not
fault
said
the
obstinate
creature
tell
edward
and
let
him
employ
a
sharp
attorney
you
have
a
supple
antagonist
and
a
daring
one
need
i
say
i
have
tried
persuasion
and
even
bribes
but
he
defies
me
set
an
attorney
on
him
or
the
police
fiat
justitia
ruat
coelum
i
put
both
hands
out
to
him
and
burst
out
alfred
why
did
you
tell
a
son
expose
his
own
father
for
shame
for
shame
i
have
suspected
it
all
long
ago
but
would
never
have
told
he
started
a
little
but
said
dodd
you
were
very
generous
to
me
but
that
is
not
exactly
a
reason
why
i
should
be
a
cur
to
you
and
an
accomplice
in
a
theft
by
which
you
suffer
i
have
no
pretensions
to
religion
like
my
sister
so
i
ca
afford
to
tamper
with
plain
right
and
wrong
what
look
calmly
on
and
see
one
man
defraud
another
i
do
it
see
defrauded
you
dodd
for
whom
i
profess
affection
and
friendship
you
miss
dodd
for
whom
i
profess
love
and
constancy
stand
and
see
you
swindled
into
poverty
of
what
do
you
think
i
am
made
my
stomach
rises
against
it
my
blood
boils
against
it
my
flesh
creeps
at
it
my
soul
loathes
it
then
after
this
great
burst
he
seemed
to
turn
feeble
said
he
faltering
know
what
i
have
done
i
have
signed
the
death
warrant
of
our
love
dear
to
me
as
life
but
i
ca
help
it
oh
julia
julia
my
lost
love
you
can
never
look
on
me
again
you
must
not
love
a
man
you
can
not
marry
cheat
hardie
wretched
son
but
what
could
i
do
fate
offers
me
but
the
miserable
choice
of
desolation
or
cowardly
rascality
i
choose
desolation
and
i
mean
to
stand
by
my
choice
like
a
man
so
ladies
the
poor
proud
creature
rose
from
his
seat
and
bowed
stiffly
and
haughtily
to
us
both
and
was
going
away
without
another
word
and
i
do
believe
for
ever
but
his
soul
had
been
too
great
for
his
body
his
poor
lips
turned
pale
and
he
staggered
and
would
have
fallen
but
mamma
screamed
to
me
and
she
he
loves
so
dearly
and
abandons
so
cruelly
woke
from
a
stupor
of
despair
and
flew
and
caught
him
fainting
in
these
chapter
xxvii
we
laid
the
poor
proud
creature
on
the
sofa
and
bathed
his
face
with
eau
de
cologne
he
spoke
directly
and
said
that
was
nice
and
head
his
head
and
i
do
think
he
was
ever
quite
insensible
but
he
did
not
know
what
was
going
on
for
presently
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
stared
at
us
so
and
then
closed
them
with
oh
such
a
sigh
it
swelled
my
heart
almost
to
bursting
and
to
think
i
could
say
nothing
but
mamma
soothed
him
and
insisted
on
his
keeping
quiet
for
he
wanted
to
run
away
from
us
she
was
never
so
good
to
him
before
she
said
dear
child
you
have
my
pity
and
my
esteem
alas
that
at
your
age
you
should
be
tried
like
this
how
few
in
this
sorry
world
would
have
acted
like
you
i
should
have
sided
with
my
own
flesh
and
blood
for
one
right
or
wrong
he
asked
said
she
or
wrong
then
she
turned
to
me
shall
all
the
generosity
be
on
his
side
i
kissed
her
and
clung
to
her
but
dared
not
speak
but
i
was
mad
enough
to
hope
i
scarcely
know
what
till
she
said
in
the
same
kind
sorrowful
voice
agree
with
you
you
can
never
be
my
son
nor
husband
but
as
for
that
money
it
revolts
me
to
proceed
to
extremes
against
one
who
after
all
is
your
father
my
poor
poor
chivalrous
boy
but
she
would
decide
nothing
without
edward
he
had
taken
his
father
place
in
this
house
so
then
i
gave
all
up
for
edward
is
made
of
iron
alfred
was
clearer
sighted
than
i
and
never
had
a
hope
he
put
his
arm
round
mamma
and
kissed
her
and
she
kissed
him
and
he
kissed
my
hand
and
crept
away
and
i
heard
his
step
on
the
stair
and
on
the
road
ever
so
far
and
life
seemed
ended
for
me
when
i
heard
it
no
more
edward
has
come
home
mamma
told
him
all
he
listened
gravely
i
hung
upon
his
hips
and
at
last
the
oracle
spoke
and
said
is
a
nice
muddle
more
we
could
not
get
from
him
he
must
sleep
on
it
o
suspense
you
torture
he
had
seen
a
place
he
thinks
will
suit
us
it
is
a
bad
omen
his
saying
that
so
soon
after
as
i
went
to
bed
i
could
not
help
whispering
he
and
i
are
parted
so
will
you
and
jane
the
cruel
boy
answered
me
loud
you
little
girl
that
is
a
temptation
and
you
have
put
me
on
my
guard
oh
how
hard
it
is
to
understand
a
they
so
impracticable
with
their
justice
and
things
i
came
away
with
my
cheeks
burning
and
my
heart
like
a
stone
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
my
poor
poor
unhappy
noble
alfred
dec
mamma
and
edward
have
discussed
it
they
say
nothing
to
me
can
they
have
written
to
him
i
go
about
my
duties
like
a
ghost
and
pray
for
submission
to
the
divine
dec
as
i
was
reading
by
main
force
to
sick
girl
came
sarah
all
in
a
hurry
with
i
was
wanted
miss
but
i
finish
my
chapter
and
o
how
hard
the
devil
tried
to
make
me
gabble
it
so
i
clenched
my
teeth
at
him
and
read
it
as
if
i
was
spelling
it
and
then
i
fly
was
there
and
they
all
sat
waiting
for
me
i
was
hot
and
cold
all
at
the
same
time
and
he
rose
and
bowed
to
me
and
i
curtseyed
to
him
and
sat
down
and
took
my
work
and
did
know
one
bit
what
i
was
doing
and
our
new
oracle
edward
laid
down
the
law
like
anything
here
hardie
said
he
anybody
but
you
had
told
us
about
this
fourteen
thousand
pounds
i
should
have
set
the
police
on
your
governor
before
now
but
it
seems
to
me
a
shabby
thing
to
attack
a
father
on
the
son
information
especially
when
it
out
of
love
for
one
of
us
he
has
denounced
his
own
flesh
and
blood
no
said
alfred
eagerly
of
love
of
justice
you
think
so
my
fine
fellow
but
you
would
not
have
done
it
for
a
stranger
said
edward
then
he
went
on
all
blunders
the
worst
is
to
fall
between
two
stools
look
here
mamma
we
decide
for
the
sake
not
to
attack
the
father
after
that
it
would
be
very
inconsistent
to
turn
the
cold
shoulder
to
the
son
another
thing
who
suffers
most
by
this
fraud
why
the
man
that
marries
julia
alfred
burst
out
impetuously
prove
that
to
me
and
let
me
be
that
sufferer
edward
turned
calmly
to
mamma
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
was
in
our
hands
what
should
you
do
with
it
the
dear
thing
said
she
should
settle
at
least
ten
thousand
of
it
on
me
and
marry
me
to
this
poor
motherless
boy
i
have
learned
to
love
myself
said
she
said
edward
see
it
is
you
who
lose
by
your
governor
i
wo
say
what
if
you
marry
my
sister
alfred
took
his
hand
and
said
bless
you
for
telling
me
this
then
edward
turned
to
mamma
and
me
and
said
poor
fellow
has
left
his
father
house
because
he
wronged
us
then
this
house
ought
to
open
its
arms
to
him
that
is
only
justice
but
now
to
be
just
to
our
side
i
have
been
to
crawford
the
lawyer
and
i
find
this
hardie
junior
has
ten
thousand
pounds
of
his
own
that
ought
to
be
settled
on
julia
to
make
up
for
what
she
loses
by
hardie
senior
i
wo
say
what
anybody
settles
any
of
their
trash
on
i
beat
them
and
throw
it
in
the
fire
said
i
i
hated
money
the
oracle
asked
me
directly
did
i
hate
clothes
and
food
and
charity
to
the
poor
and
cleanliness
and
decency
then
i
did
hate
money
none
of
these
things
can
exist
without
money
you
little
romantic
humbug
you
shut
up
mamma
rebuked
him
for
his
expressions
but
approved
his
sentiments
but
i
did
not
care
for
his
sentiments
for
smiled
on
me
and
said
two
are
of
one
mind
we
shall
transfer
our
fortune
to
captain
dodd
whom
my
father
has
robbed
julia
will
consent
to
share
my
honest
poverty
we
will
talk
about
that
said
edward
pompously
about
it
without
me
then
i
cried
and
got
up
and
marched
out
indignant
only
it
was
partly
my
low
cunning
to
hide
my
face
that
i
could
not
keep
the
rapture
out
of
and
as
soon
as
i
had
retired
with
cold
dignity
off
i
skipped
into
the
garden
to
let
my
face
loose
and
i
think
they
sent
him
after
me
for
i
heard
his
quick
step
behind
me
so
i
ran
away
from
him
as
hard
as
i
could
so
of
course
he
soon
caught
me
in
the
shrubbery
where
he
first
asked
me
to
be
his
and
he
kissed
both
my
hands
again
and
again
like
wildfire
as
he
is
and
he
said
are
right
dearest
let
them
talk
of
their
trash
while
i
tell
you
how
i
adore
you
poverty
with
you
will
be
the
soul
wealth
even
misfortune
by
your
side
would
hardly
be
misfortune
let
all
the
world
go
and
let
you
and
i
be
one
and
live
together
and
die
together
for
now
i
see
i
could
not
have
lived
without
you
nor
without
your
love
and
i
whispered
something
on
his
shoulder
no
matter
what
what
signifies
the
cackle
of
a
goose
and
we
mingled
our
happy
tears
and
our
hearts
and
our
souls
ah
love
is
a
sweet
a
dreadful
passion
what
we
two
have
gone
through
for
one
another
in
a
few
months
he
dined
with
us
and
edward
and
he
sat
a
long
long
time
talking
i
dare
say
it
was
only
about
their
odious
money
still
i
envied
edward
having
him
so
long
but
at
last
he
came
up
and
devoured
me
with
his
lovely
grey
eyes
and
i
sang
him
aileen
aroon
and
he
whispered
things
in
my
ear
oh
such
sweet
sweet
idiotic
darling
things
i
will
not
part
with
even
the
shadow
of
one
of
them
by
putting
it
on
paper
only
i
am
the
blessedest
creature
in
all
the
world
and
i
only
hope
to
goodness
it
is
not
very
wicked
to
be
so
happy
as
i
dec
it
is
all
settled
alfred
returns
to
oxford
to
make
up
for
lost
time
the
time
spent
in
construing
me
instead
of
greek
and
at
the
end
of
term
he
is
to
come
of
age
and
marry
somebody
marriage
what
a
word
to
put
down
it
makes
me
tingle
it
thrills
me
it
frightens
me
deliciously
no
not
deliciously
anything
but
for
suppose
being
both
of
us
fiery
and
they
all
say
one
of
them
ought
to
be
cold
blooded
for
a
pair
to
be
happy
i
should
make
him
a
downright
bad
wife
why
then
i
hope
i
shall
die
in
a
year
or
two
out
of
my
darling
way
and
let
him
have
a
good
one
instead
i
come
back
from
the
grave
and
tear
her
to
pieces
jan
found
a
saint
in
a
garret
over
a
stable
took
her
my
luncheon
clandestinely
that
is
for
my
apron
and
was
detected
and
expostulated
by
ned
he
took
me
into
his
studio
it
is
carpeted
with
shavings
and
showed
me
the
digest
an
enormous
book
he
has
made
of
newspaper
cuttings
all
in
order
and
out
of
this
authority
he
proved
vice
and
poverty
abound
most
wherever
there
are
most
charities
oh
the
poor
a
set
of
intoxicated
sneaks
and
me
a
demoralising
influence
it
is
all
very
fine
but
why
are
there
saints
in
garrets
and
that
rouses
all
my
evil
passions
and
i
can
not
bear
it
it
no
use
jan
once
a
gay
day
but
now
a
sad
one
mamma
gone
to
see
poor
papa
where
he
is
alfred
found
me
sorrowful
and
rested
my
forehead
on
his
shoulder
that
soothed
me
while
it
lasted
i
think
i
should
like
to
grow
there
mem
to
burn
this
diary
and
never
let
a
creature
see
a
syllable
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
prayed
earnestly
on
my
knees
not
to
make
an
idol
of
him
for
it
is
our
poor
idols
that
are
destroyed
for
our
weakness
which
really
i
can
not
quite
see
the
justice
jan
jane
does
not
approve
my
proposal
that
we
should
praise
now
and
then
at
the
same
hour
instead
of
always
praying
the
dear
girl
sends
me
her
unconverted
diary
show
me
she
is
a
i
have
read
most
of
it
but
really
it
seems
to
me
she
was
always
goodish
only
she
went
to
parties
and
read
novels
and
enjoyed
society
there
i
have
finished
it
oh
dear
how
like
her
diary
is
to
my
one
jan
a
sorrowful
day
he
and
i
parted
after
a
fortnight
of
the
tenderest
affection
and
that
mutual
respect
without
which
neither
of
us
i
think
could
love
long
i
had
resolved
to
be
very
brave
but
we
were
alone
and
his
bright
face
looked
so
sad
the
change
in
it
took
me
by
surprise
and
my
resolution
failed
i
clung
to
him
if
gentlemen
could
interpret
as
we
can
he
would
never
have
left
me
it
is
better
as
it
is
he
kissed
my
tears
away
as
fast
as
they
came
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
kissed
more
than
my
hand
so
i
shall
have
that
to
think
of
and
his
dear
promised
letters
but
it
made
me
cry
more
at
the
time
of
course
some
day
when
we
have
been
married
years
and
years
i
shall
tell
him
not
to
go
and
pay
a
lady
for
every
tear
if
he
wants
her
to
leave
off
the
whole
place
so
gloomy
and
vacant
jan
poverty
stares
us
in
the
face
edward
says
we
could
make
a
modest
living
in
london
and
nobody
be
the
wiser
but
here
we
are
known
and
be
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
fools
he
says
he
has
now
made
me
seriously
promise
not
to
give
money
and
things
out
of
the
house
to
the
poor
it
is
robbing
my
mother
and
him
ah
now
i
see
it
nonsense
to
despise
money
here
i
come
home
sad
from
my
poor
people
and
i
used
to
return
warm
all
over
and
the
poor
old
souls
do
not
enjoy
my
sermons
half
so
much
as
when
i
gave
them
nice
things
to
eat
along
with
them
the
dear
boy
that
i
always
loved
dearly
but
and
love
now
that
he
has
turned
an
intolerable
tyrant
and
he
used
to
be
wax
has
put
down
two
maids
out
of
our
three
and
brings
our
dinner
up
himself
in
a
jacket
then
puts
on
his
coat
and
sits
down
with
us
and
we
sigh
at
him
and
he
grins
and
derides
us
he
does
not
care
one
straw
for
pomp
and
mamma
and
i
have
to
dress
one
another
now
and
i
like
jan
he
says
we
may
now
by
great
economy
subsist
honestly
till
my
but
then
mamma
and
he
must
oh
what
stout
hearts
men
have
they
can
jest
at
sorrow
even
when
in
spite
of
their
great
thick
skins
they
feel
it
ah
the
real
poor
are
happy
they
marry
and
need
not
leave
the
parish
where
their
mother
feb
a
kind
and
most
delicate
letter
from
jane
she
says
and
i
are
much
grieved
at
captain
dodd
affliction
and
deeply
concerned
at
your
loss
by
the
bank
papa
has
asked
uncle
thomas
for
two
hundred
pounds
and
i
entreat
you
to
oblige
me
by
receiving
it
at
my
hands
and
applying
it
according
to
the
dictates
of
your
own
affectionate
actually
our
viceroy
will
not
let
me
take
it
he
says
he
will
not
accept
a
crumb
from
the
man
who
owes
us
a
feb
jane
mortified
and
no
wonder
if
she
knew
how
very
poor
we
are
she
would
be
surprised
as
well
i
have
implored
her
not
to
take
it
to
heart
for
that
all
will
be
explained
one
day
and
she
will
see
we
not
his
dear
letters
i
feed
on
them
we
have
no
secrets
no
two
minds
he
is
to
be
a
first
class
and
then
a
private
tutor
our
money
is
to
go
to
mamma
it
is
he
and
i
that
are
to
work
our
fingers
to
the
bone
i
am
so
happy
and
never
let
them
be
driven
by
injustice
from
their
home
but
all
this
is
a
great
secret
the
viceroy
will
be
defeated
only
i
let
him
talk
till
alfred
is
here
to
back
me
no
it
is
just
the
rightful
owner
of
fourteen
thousand
pounds
should
be
poor
how
shallow
female
education
is
i
was
always
led
to
suppose
modesty
is
the
highest
virtue
no
such
thing
justice
is
the
queen
of
the
virtues
is
justice
march
on
reperusing
this
diary
it
is
demoralising
very
it
feeds
self
of
all
the
detestable
compositions
me
me
me
from
one
end
to
another
for
when
it
is
not
about
myself
it
is
about
alfred
and
that
it
is
my
though
not
my
so
now
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
from
this
day
i
shall
record
only
the
things
that
happen
in
this
house
and
what
my
betters
say
to
not
what
i
say
and
the
texts
and

of
the
sermons

from
jane
hardie
march
in
my
district
again
the
first
time
since
my
illness
from
which
i
am
indeed
but
half
recovered
spoke
faithfully
to
about
her
infidel
husband
told
her
not
to
try
and
talk
to
him
but
to
talk
to
god
about
him
gave
her
my
tract
quiet
heart
came
home
tired
prayed
to
be
used
to
sharpen
the
sickles
of
other
march
at
philip
to
hear
the
bishop
in
the
midst
of
an
excellent
sermon
on
i
he
came
out
with
the
waters
of
baptism
to
my
horror
he
disclaimed
the
extravagant
views
some
of
them
take
then
hankered
after
what
he
denied
and
then
partly
unsaid
too
while
the
poor
man
was
trimming
his
sails
i
slunk
behind
a
pillar
in
the
corner
of
my
pew
and
fell
on
my
knees
and
prayed
a
against
the
stream
of
poison
flowing
on
the
congregation
oh
i
felt
like
jeremiah
in
his
in
the
evening
papa
forbade
me
to
go
to
church
again
said
the
wind
was
too
cold
i
kissed
him
and
went
up
to
my
room
and
put
my
head
between
the
pillows
not
to
hear
the
bells
prayed
for
poor
b
march
sadly
disappointed
in
i
did
hope
he
was
embittering
the
world
to
her
by
degrees
but
for
some
time
past
she
writes
in
spirits
another
friend
after
seeking
rest
in
the
world
is
now
seeking
it
in
ritualism
may
both
be
drawn
from
their
rotten
reeds
to
the
cross
oh
this
moral
may
my
heart
retain
all
hopes
of
happiness
on
earth
are
vain
march
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
she
is
corresponding
with
alfred
indeed
she
makes
no
secret
of
it
wrote
her
a
c
faithful
letter
received
a
short
reply
saying
i
had
made
her
unhappy
and
begging
me
to
suspend
my
judgment
till
she
could
undeceive
me
without
giving
me
too
much
pain
what
mystery
is
this
alfred
announces
his
unalterable
determination
to
marry
julia
i
read
the
letter
to
papa
directly
he
was
silent
for
a
long
time
and
then
said
the
worse
for
both
of
them
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
suppress
a
thrill
of
carnal
complacency
at
the
thought
this
might
in
time
pave
the
way
to
another
union
even
to
think
of
that

a
sin

for
increase
of
humility
i
am
so
afraid
my
great
success
in
his
vineyard
has
seduced
me
into
feeling
as
if
there
was
a
spring
of
living

every
drop

sent
for
him

what
is
it
makes
me
think
that

no
true

his
advice

do
like

agitated

faithful
letter
to

while

was
writing
to
our
march

it

of

to
see
me
by
appointment
just
after
luncheon
a
sweet
meeting
he
came
in
and
took
my
hand
and
in
that
posture
prayed
that
the
holy

gushed
out
about
the
blessing
of
having
at
last
one
earthly
friend
to
whom
she
could
confide
everything
on
this
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
remind

then
what
a
blank
and
i
was
going
on
to
detach
her
from

arm

when
she
burst
out
crying
and
left
me

bear
the
truth

woman
in

to

him
at

how
bright

so
affectionately
and
was
as
kind
and
loving
as
could
be

poor
unfaithful
wretch
went
hanging

texts
on
solomon
song
you
know
very
well
there
is
not
one
no
grave
writer
in
all
scripture
has
ever
deigned
to
cite
or
notice
that
coarse
composition
puellarum
deliciae
j
modest
periphrasis
for
i
like
motto
for
this
diary
ego
et
deus
in
other
words
a
good
sober
humble
christian
to
whom
the
daring
familiarities
of
your
school
seem
blasphemies
here
i
recognise
my
sister
somewhat
spoiled
by
a
detestable
sect
but
lovable
by
nature
which
she
is
for
ever
abusing
and
therefore
always
amiable
when
off
her
guard
march
crawford
the
attorney
called
and
told
papa
his
son
had
instructed
him
to
examine
the
and
to
draw
his
marriage
settlement
papa
treated
him
with
the
greatest
civility
and
brought
him
the
deed
he
wanted
to
take
it
away
to
copy
but
papa
said
he
had
better
send
a
clerk
here
poor
papa
hid
his
distress
from
this
gentleman
though
not
from
me
and
gave
him
a
glass
of
wine
then
crawford
chatted
and
let
out
alfred
had
asked
him
to
advance
a
hundred
pounds
for
the
wedding
presents
papa
said
he
might
do
so
with
perfect
safety
but
the
moment
he
was
gone
his
whole
manner
changed
he
walked
about
in
terrible
anger
and
agitation
and
then
sat
down
and
wrote
letters
one
was
to
uncle
thomas
and
one
to
a
wycherley
i
believe
a
brother
of
the
doctor
i
never
knew
him
so
long
writing
two
letters
before
heard
a
noise
in
the
road
and
it
was
maxley
and
the
boys
after
him
hooting
they
have
found
out
his
infirmity
what
a
savage
animal
is
man
till
grace
changes
him
the
poor
soul
had
a
stick
and
now
and
then
turned
and
struck
at
them
but
his
tormentors
were
too
nimble
i
drew
papa
to
the
window
and
showed
him
and
reminded
him
of
the
poor
request
he
answered
impatiently
what
was
that
to
him
have
a
worse
case
nearer
hand
charity
begins
at
home
i
ventured
to
say
yes
but
it
did
not
begin
end
at
march
osmond
here
and
over
my
work
i
heard
papa
tell
him
alfred
is
blackening
his
character
in
the
town
with
some
impossible
story
about
fourteen
thousand
pounds
osmond
very
kind
and
sympathising
set
it
all
down
to
illusion
assured
papa
there
was
neither
malice
nor
insincerity
in
it
what
the
better
am
i
for
that
said
poor
papa
i
am
slandered
i
am
slandered
and
they
went
out
together
papa
seems
to
feel
this
engagement
more
than
all
his
troubles
and
knowing
by
sad
experience
it
is
useless
to
expostulate
with
alfred
i
wrote
a
long
and
faithful
letter
to
julia
just
before
luncheon
putting
it
to
her
as
a
christian
whether
she
could
reconcile
it
to
her
profession
to
set
a
son
against
his
father
and
marry
him
in
open
defiance
she
replied
that
her
mother
approved
the
marriage
and
she
owed
no
obedience
nor
affection
either
to
parent
sent
back
a
line
rebuking
her
for
this
quibble
at
received
a
note
from
dodd
proposing
that
the
correspondence
between
myself
and
her
daughter
should
cease
the
retorted
with
an
amendment
that
it
should
cease
no
reply
such
are
worldlings
remonstrance
only
galls
them
and
so
in
one
afternoon
correspondence
ends
one
more
of
my
christian
friendships
with
persons
of
my
own
sex
this
is
the
eighth
to
which
a
carnal
attachment
has
been
speedily
fatal
in
the
evening
alfred
came
in
looking
very
red
and
asked
me
whether
it
was
not
and
uncharitable
of
me
to
condemn
so
many
estimable
persons
all
better
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
than
i
am
i
replied
with
the
fifth
commandment
he
bit
his
lip
and
said
had
better
not
meet
again
until
you
have
found
out
which
is
worthiest
of
honour
your
father
or
your
brother
and
with
this
he
left
abruptly
and
something
tells
me
i
shall
not
see
him
again
my
faithfulness
has
wounded
him
to
the
quick
alas
prayed
for
him
and
cried
myself
to
april
met
disguised
as
a
common
workman
and
carrying
a
sack
full
of
things
i
was
so
shocked
i
could
not
maintain
my
resolution
i
said
edward
what
are
you
doing
he
blushed
a
little
but
told
me
he
was
going
to
sell
some
candlesticks
and
things
of
his
making
and
he
should
get
a
better
price
in
that
dress
all
traders
looked
on
a
as
a
thing
made
to
be
pillaged
then
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
turn
them
into
a
bonnet
and
a
wreath
and
his
beautiful
brown
eyes
sparkled
with
affection
what
egotistical
creatures
must
be
i
was
quite
overcome
and
said
oh
why
did
he
refuse
our
offer
did
he
hate
me
so
very
much
that
he
would
not
even
take
his
due
from
my
hand
he
said
in
our
house
is
so
unjust
to
you
as
to
hate
you
my
sister
honours
you
and
is
very
sorry
you
think
ill
of
her
and
as
for
me
i
love
you
you
know
how
i
love
you
i
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
and
sobbed
out
you
must
not
you
must
not
my
poor
father
has
one
disobedient
child
already
he
said
softly
cry
dear
one
have
a
little
patience
perhaps
the
clouds
will
clear
and
meantime
why
think
so
ill
of
us
consider
we
are
four
in
number
of
different
dispositious
yet
all
of
one
mind
about
julia
marrying
alfred
may
we
not
be
right
may
we
not
know
something
we
love
you
too
well
to
tell
you
his
words
and
his
rich
manly
voice
were
so
soothing
i
gave
him
just
one
hand
while
i
still
hid
my
burning
face
with
the
other
he
kissed
the
hand
i
yielded
him
and
left
me
abruptly
if
alfred
should
be
right
i
am
staggered
now
he
puts
it
so
much
more
april
a
letter
from
alfred
announcing
his
wedding
by
special
license
for
the
made
no
reply
what
i
say
papa
on
my
reading
it
out
left
his
very
breakfast
half
finished
and
packed
up
his
bag
and
rushed
up
to
london
i
caught
a
side
view
of
his
face
and
i
am
miserable
such
a
new
such
a
terrible
expression
a
vile
expression
heaven
forgive
me
it
seemed
the
look
of
one
who
meditated
a
chapter
xxix
the
spirit
of
dissension
in
musgrove
cottage
penetrated
to
the
very
kitchen
old
betty
sided
with
alfred
and
combated
in
her
place
the
creed
of
the
parlour
why
according
to
miss
the
young
sparrows
are
bound
never
to
fly
out
of
the
nest
or
else
have
the
bible
flung
at
she
do
go
on
about
god
will
seems
to
me
is
his
will
the
world
should
be
peopled
by
body
and
beast
which
they
are
both
his
creatures
and
by
the
same
toaken
if
they
do
marry
they
does
wus
certainly
whilst
a
young
man
bides
at
home
it
behoves
him
to
be
dutiful
but
that
ai
to
say
he
to
bide
at
home
for
ever
master
alfred
time
is
come
to
leave
we
and
be
master
in
a
house
of
his
own
as
his
father
done
before
him
which
he
forgets
that
now
he
is
grown
to
man
estate
and
got
his
mother
money
and
no
more
bound
to
our
master
than
i
she
said
too
that
parting
blights
more
quarrels
than
it
breeds
and
she
constantly
invited
peggy
to
speak
up
and
gainsay
her
but
peggy
was
a
young
woman
with
white
eyelashes
and
given
to
looking
down
and
not
to
speaking
up
she
was
always
watching
hardie
in
company
like
a
cat
cream
and
hovering
about
him
when
alone
betty
went
so
far
as
to
accuse
her
of
colloguing
with
him
against
alfred
and
of
setting
her
cap
at
master
which
accusation
elicited
no
direct
reply
but
stinging
innuendoes
hours
after
now
if
one
looks
into
the
thing
the
elements
of
discord
had
attacked
albion
villa
quite
as
powerfully
as
musgrove
cottage
but
had
hitherto
failed
signally
the
mutual
affection
of
the
dodds
was
so
complete
and
no
unprincipled
person
among
them
to
split
the
good
and
now
that
the
wedding
drew
near
there
was
but
one
joyful
heart
within
the
walls
though
the
others
were
too
kind
and
unselfish
to
throw
cold
water
dodd
own
wedding
had
ended
in
a
piteous
separation
and
now
to
part
with
her
darling
child
and
launch
her
on
the
uncertain
waves
of
matrimony
she
heaved
many
a
sigh
when
alone
but
as
there
were
no
bounds
to
her
maternal
love
so
there
were
no
exceptions
to
her
politeness
over
her
aching
heart
she
forced
on
a
wedding
face
subdued
but
hopeful
for
her
daughter
as
she
would
for
any
other
young
lady
about
to
be
married
beneath
her
roof
it
wanted
but
six
days
when
one
morning
after
breakfast
the
bereaved
wife
and
mother
about
to
be
deserted
addressed
her
son
and
viceroy
thus
edward
we
borrow
fifty
fifty
pounds
what
for
who
wants
that
why
want
it
said
dodd
stoutly
oh
if
want
it
what
to
do
please
why
to
buy
her
wedding
clothes
i
thought
what
her
would
come
to
said
julia
reproachfully
edward
shook
his
head
and
said
he
who
goes
a
borrowing
goes
a
sorrowing
but
she
is
not
a
he
objected
dodd
with
the
subtlety
of
a
schoolman
and
who
ever
heard
of
a
young
lady
being
married
without
some
things
to
be
married
well
i
heard
nudity
is
not
the
cheese
on
public
occasions
but
why
not
go
dressed
like
a
lady
as
she
always
does
only
with
white
gloves
and
be
married
without
any
bother
and
you
talk
like
a
boy
said
dodd
i
could
not
bear
it
my
poor
child
and
she
cast
a
look
of
tenderest
pity
on
the
proposed
victim
well
suppose
we
make
the
poor
child
the
judge
suggested
edward
he
then
put
it
to
julia
whether
under
the
circumstances
she
would
wish
them
to
run
in
debt
buying
her
finery
to
wear
for
a
day
it
was
not
fair
to
ask
said
dodd
with
a
sigh
julia
blushed
and
hesitated
and
said
she
would
be
candid
and
then
stopped
ugh
ejaculated
edward
this
is
a
bad
beginning
girl
candour
now
for
a
masterpiece
of
julia
inquired
how
he
dared
and
dodd
said
warmly
that
julia
was
not
like
other
people
she
could
be
candid
had
actually
done
it
more
than
once
within
her
recollection
the
young
lady
justified
the
exception
as
follows
if
i
was
going
to
be
married
to
myself
or
to
some
gentleman
i
did
not
care
for
i
would
not
spend
a
shilling
but
i
am
going
to
marry
and
so
oh
edward
think
of
them
saying
has
he
married
a
dowdy
why
she
had
new
things
on
to
go
to
church
with
him
no
bonnet
no
wreath
no
new
white
dress
to
mortify
him
the
very
first
day
of
our
the
sentence
remained
unfinished
but
two
lovely
eyes
filled
to
the
very
brim
without
running
over
and
completed
the
sense
and
did
the
viceroy
business
though
a
brother
why
you
dear
little
goose
said
he
of
course
i
do
mean
that
i
have
as
good
as
got
the
things
we
must
buy
and
those
are
a
new
bonnet
ah
a
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
oh
you
good
boy
four
pair
of
gloves
two
white
one
is
safe
to
break
two
dark
very
dark
invisible
green
or
visible
black
last
the
honeymoon
all
the
rest
you
must
find
in
the
what
fit
her
out
with
a
parcel
of
old
things
so
cruel
so
unreasonable
dear
edward
old
things
why
where
is
all
your
gorgeous
attire
from
oriental
climes
i
see
the
splendiferous
articles
arrive
and
then
they
vanish
for
now
shawls
and
indian
muslins
pray
what
use
are
they
to
a
bride
why
what
looks
nicer
than
a
white
muslin
dress
married
in
muslin
the
very
idea
makes
me
well
clap
her
on
another
how
can
you
be
so
childish
muslin
is
not
the
no
more
is
running
in
he
then
suggested
that
a
white
shawl
or
two
should
be
cut
into
a
bridal
dress
at
this
both
ladies
fair
throats
opened
on
him
with
ridicule
cut
fifty
guinea
shawls
into
dresses
that
was
male
economy
was
it
total
a
wedding
was
a
wedding
new
things
always
had
to
be
bought
for
a
wedding
and
always
would
secula
new
things
yes
said
the
pertinacious
wretch
but
they
need
not
be
things
you
ladies
go
and
confound
the
world
eyes
with
your
own
in
the
drollest
way
if
gorgeous
attire
has
lain
long
in
your
drawers
you
fancy
the
world
will
detect
on
its
glossy
surface
how
long
you
had
it
and
gloated
over
it
and
made
it
stale
to
your
eye
before
you
could
bring
your
mind
to
wear
it
that
is
your
delusion
that
and
the
itch
for
going
out
shopping
oh
i
down
on
you
mamma
dear
you
open
that
gigantic
wardrobe
of
yours
and
i
oil
my
hair
my
mug
a
little
moan
from
and
do
the
counterjumping
business
to
the
life
hand
the
things
down
to
you
unrol
grin
charge
you
per
cent
over
value
note
them
down
in
a
penny
sing
out
caesh
and
so
we
shall
get
all
julia
wants
and
go
through
the
ritual
of
shopping
without
the
substantial
disgrace
of
running
in
dodd
smiled
admiringly
as
ladies
generally
do
at
the
sauciness
of
a
young
male
but
proposed
an
amendment
she
would
open
her
wardrobe
and
look
out
all
the
contents
for
edward
inspection
and
if
the
mere
sight
of
them
did
not
convince
him
they
were
inappropriate
to
a
bride
why
then
she
would
coincide
with
his
views
and
resign
her
own
all
right
said
he
that
will
take
a
jolly
time
i
know
so
i
go
to
my
governor
first
for
the
bonnet
and
dodd
drew
in
at
this
last
slang
word
she
had
heard
young
gentlemen
apply
it
to
their
fathers
edward
she
felt
sure
would
not
so
sully
that
sacred
relation
still
the
word
was
obnoxious
for
its
past
offences
and
she
froze
at
it
i
have
not
the
honour
to
know
who
the
personage
is
you
so
describe
said
she
formally
edward
replied
very
carelessly
that
it
was
an
upholsterer
at
the
north
end
of
the
town
ah
a
tradesman
you
humph
well
yes
that
is
the
word
mamma
haw
haw
i
have
been
making
the
bloke
a
lot
of
oak
candlesticks
and
human
heads
with
sparkling
eyes
for
and
now
i
go
and
draw
my
protege
the
lady
hands
were
uplifted
towards
pitying
heaven
with
one
impulse
the
young
workman
grinned
soyons
de
notre
siecle
said
he
and
departed
whistling
in
the
tenor
clef
he
had
the
mellowest
whistle
after
a
few
minutes
well
spent
in
deploring
the
fall
of
her
oxonian
and
gently
denouncing
his
motto
and
his
century
its
ways
and
above
all
its
words
dodd
took
julia
to
her
bedroom
and
unlocked
drawers
and
doors
in
her
wardrobe
and
straightway
sarah
who
was
hurriedly
flogging
the
chairs
with
a
duster
relaxed
and
began
to
work
on
a
as
slowly
as
if
she
was
drawing
nelson
lions
at
a
thousand
pounds
the
tail
dodd
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
three
pieces
of
worked
indian
muslin
a
little
discoloured
by
hoarding
there
that
must
be
bleached
and
make
you
some
wrappers
for
the
honeymoon
if
the
weather
is
at
all
fine
and
petticoats
to
match
next
an
envelope
consisting
of
two
foolscap
sheets
tacked
this
carefully
undone
upon
the
bed
revealed
a
brussels
lace
flounce
and
a
veil
it
was
my
own
said
dodd
softly
i
saved
it
for
you
see
here
is
your
name
written
on
it
seventeen
years
ago
i
thought
dear
little
toddler
will
have
wings
some
day
and
then
she
will
leave
me
but
now
i
am
almost
afraid
to
let
you
wear
it
it
might
bring
you
misfortune
suppose
after
years
of
wedded
love
you
should
be
bereaved
of
dodd
choked
and
arms
were
round
her
neck
in
a
moment
i
risk
it
cried
she
impetuously
if
it
but
makes
me
as
beloved
as
you
are
i
wear
it
come
weal
come
woe
and
then
i
shall
feel
it
over
me
at
the
altar
like
my
guardian
angel
wings
my
own
sweet
darling
mamma
oh
what
an
idiot
what
a
wretch
i
am
to
leave
you
at
this
unfortunate
unexpected
burst
interrupted
business
sadly
dodd
sank
down
directly
on
the
bed
and
wept
julia
cried
over
her
and
sarah
plumped
herself
down
in
a
chair
and
blubbered
but
wedding
flowers
are
generally
well
watered
in
the
private
apartments
patient
dodd
soon
recovered
herself
this
is
childish
of
me
when
i
think
that
there
are
mothers
who
see
their
children
go
from
the
house
corpses
not
brides
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
come
a
ah
here
is
and
she
produced
a
white
china
crape
shawl
oh
how
sweet
said
julia
why
have
you
never
worn
it
dear
me
child
what
use
would
things
be
to
those
i
love
if
i
went
and
them
the
next
article
she
laid
her
hand
on
was
a
roll
of
white
poplin
and
drew
an
exclamation
from
dodd
herself
if
i
had
not
forgotten
this
and
it
is
the
very
thing
your
dear
papa
bought
me
this
in
london
and
i
remonstrated
with
him
well
for
buying
me
such
a
delicate
thing
only
once
wear
i
kissed
it
and
put
it
away
and
forgot
it
they
if
you
keep
a
thing
seven
years
it
just
seven
years
since
he
gave
it
to
me
really
the
dear
boy
is
a
witch
this
is
your
wedding
dress
my
precious
she
unrolled
a
few
yards
on
the
bed
to
show
it
and
asked
the
gloating
sarah
with
a
great
appearance
of
consideration
whether
they
were
not
detaining
her
from
her
occupations
oh
no
mum
this
glass
have
got
so
dull
i
just
polishing
of
it
a
bit
i
sha
be
a
minute
now
from
silver
tissue
paper
dodd
evolved
a
dress
unmade
of
white
crape
embroidered
in
true
of
violet
silk
and
ears
of
wheat
in
gold
then
there
was
a
scream
at
the
glass
and
sarah
seen
in
it
with
ten
claws
in
the
air
very
wide
apart
she
had
slily
turned
the
mirror
and
was
devouring
the
reflexion
of
the
finery
and
this
last
indian
fabric
overpowered
her
her
exclamation
was
instantly
followed
by
much
polishing
but
dodd
replied
to
it
after
the
manner
of
her
sex
well
it
lovely
said
she
to
julia
but
where
is
the
one
with
beetle
wings
oh
real
beetles
wings
mamma
inquired
julia
yes
so
they
are
and
how
wicked
and
what
a
lovely
green
i
will
never
wear
them
they
are
prismatic
now
if
ever
i
am
to
be
a
christian
i
had
better
begin
everything
a
beginning
oh
vanity
of
women
you
stick
at
nothing
a
thousand
innocent
lives
stolen
to
make
one
dress
and
she
put
one
hand
before
her
eyes
and
with
the
other
ordered
the
dress
back
into
the
wardrobe
with
genuine
agitation
my
dear
what
expressions
and
you
need
not
wear
it
indeed
neither
of
them
is
fit
for
that
purpose
but
you
have
a
pretty
thing
or
two
about
you
i
have
hoarded
these
a
good
many
years
now
it
is
your
turn
to
have
them
by
you
and
let
me
see
you
want
a
travelling
cloak
but
the
dear
boy
will
not
let
us
so
choose
a
warm
a
rich
but
modest
one
was
soon
found
and
julia
tried
it
on
arching
her
supple
neck
and
looking
down
over
her
shoulder
to
see
the
effect
behind
in
which
attitude
oh
for
an
immortal
brush
to
paint
her
or
anything
half
as
bright
supple
graceful
and
every
inch
a
woman
at
this
moment
dodd
threw
a
lovely
blue
indian
shawl
on
the
bed
galvanising
sarah
so
that
up
went
her
hands
again
and
the
door
opened
softly
and
a
handsome
head
in
a
paper
cap
peeped
on
the
scene
inquiring
with
mock
timidity
may
british
workman
come
in
he
was
invited
warmly
julia
whipped
his
cap
off
and
tore
it
in
two
reddening
and
dodd
intending
to
compliment
his
foresight
showed
him
the
bed
laden
with
the
treasures
they
had
disinterred
from
mahogany
tomb
well
mother
said
he
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
they
are
inappropriate
enough
the
whole
the
ladies
looked
at
one
another
and
sarah
permitted
herself
a
species
of
snort
do
we
want
sarah
he
asked
quietly
she
retired
bridling
inappropriate
exclaimed
dodd
there
is
nothing
here
unfit
for
a
bride
good
heavens
would
you
trick
her
out
like
a
princess
we
must
we
are
too
poor
to
dress
her
like
a
cinderella
at
your
service
observed
julia
complacently
and
pirouetted
before
him
in
her
new
shawl
ideas
rejected
peremptorily
at
the
time
often
rankle
and
bear
fruit
dodd
took
up
the
blue
shawl
and
said
she
would
make
julia
a
peignoir
of
it
and
the
border
being
narrowish
would
do
for
the
bottom
that
was
a
good
notion
of
yours
darling
said
she
bestowing
a
sweet
smile
on
edward
he
grunted
then
she
took
out
a
bundle
of
lace
oh
for
pity
sake
no
more
cried
the
british
now
dearest
you
have
interfered
once
in
feminine
affairs
and
we
submitted
but
if
you
say
another
word
i
will
trim
her
poplin
with
honiton
two
feet
quarter
quarter
cried
edward
i
dumb
grant
me
but
this
have
nothing
made
up
for
her
out
of
the
house
you
know
there
is
no
dressmaker
in
barkington
can
cut
like
you
and
then
that
will
put
some
limit
to
our
dodd
agreed
but
she
must
have
a
woman
in
to
sew
edward
grunted
at
this
and
said
i
wish
i
could
turn
you
these
gowns
with
my
lathe
what
a
deal
of
time
and
bother
it
would
save
however
if
you
want
any
stuffing
come
to
me
i
lend
you
lots
of
shavings
make
the
silk
rustle
oh
here
is
my
governor
and
he
produced
now
look
there
said
julia
sorrowfully
it
is
money
and
i
thought
you
were
going
to
bring
me
the
very
bonnet
yourself
then
i
should
have
valued
oh
yes
replied
the
young
gentleman
ironically
can
i
choose
a
bonnet
to
satisfy
such
swells
as
you
and
mamma
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
go
with
you
and
look
as
wise
as
solomon
all
the
time
you
are
choosing
a
capital
plan
said
julia
edward
then
shook
his
fist
at
the
finery
and
retired
to
work
again
for
his
governor
flowers
he
observed
are
indispensable
at
a
wedding
breakfast
i
hear
too
it
is
considered
the
right
cheese
to
add
something
in
the
shape
of
exit
whistling
in
the
tenor
clef
and
keeping
their
hearts
up
like
a
man
so
now
there
were
two
workshops
in
albion
villa
ned
study
as
he
called
it
and
the
in
the
former
shavings
flew
and
settled
at
their
ease
and
the
whirr
of
the
lathe
slept
not
the
latter
was
all
patterns
tapes
hooks
and
eyes
whalebone
cuttings
of
muslin
poplin
and
paper
clouds
of
snakes
of
piping
skeins
shreds
and
the
floor
literally
sown
with
pins
escaped
from
the
fingers
of
the
fair
those
taper
fingers
so
typical
of
the
minds
of
their
owners
or
they
have
softness
suppleness
nimbleness
adroitness
and
a
plentiful
lack
of
tenacity
the
days
passed
in
hard
work
and
the
evenings
in
wooing
never
sweeter
than
when
it
has
been
so
earned
and
at
last
came
the
wedding
eve
sampson
who
was
to
give
the
bride
away
arrived
just
before
the
party
including
alfred
sat
down
to
a
charming
little
dinner
they
ate
beetles
wings
and
drank
indian
muslin
fifteen
years
in
the
wood
for
the
lathe
and
the
chisel
proved
insufficient
and
julia
having
really
denied
herself
as
an
aspirant
to
christianity
that
assassin
robe
dodd
sold
it
under
the
rose
to
a
fat
old
dowager
for
whom
nothing
was
too
fine
and
so
kept
up
appearances
julia
and
alfred
were
profoundly
happy
at
bottom
yet
their
union
was
attended
with
too
many
drawbacks
for
boisterous
gaiety
and
alfred
up
to
this
time
had
shown
a
seriousness
and
sobriety
of
bliss
that
won
dodd
gratitude
it
was
the
demeanour
of
a
delicate
mind
it
became
his
own
position
at
odds
with
his
own
flesh
and
blood
for
julia
sake
it
became
him
as
the
of
a
poor
woman
so
lately
bereaved
of
her
husband
and
reduced
to
poverty
by
one
bearing
the
name
of
hardie
but
now
sampson
introduced
a
gayer
element
he
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
life
of
death
and
trouble
this
had
not
hardened
him
but
encountering
a
sturdy
valiant
nature
had
made
him
terribly
tough
and
elastic
it
was
now
his
way
never
to
go
forward
or
backward
a
single
step
after
sorrow
he
seldom
mentioned
a
dead
friend
or
relation
and
if
others
forced
the
dreary
topic
on
him
they
could
never
hold
him
to
it
he
was
away
directly
to
something
pleasant
or
useful
like
a
grasshopper
skipping
off
a
grave
into
the
green
grass
he
had
felt
keenly
about
david
while
there
was
anything
to
be
done
but
now
his
poor
friend
was
in
a
madhouse
thanks
to
the
lancet
and
there
was
an
end
of
thinking
about
him
would
do
him
no
good
the
present
only
is
irresistible
past
and
future
ills
the
mind
can
bar
out
by
a
resolute
effort
the
bride
will
very
likely
die
of
her
first
child
well
then
forget
that
just
now
her
father
is
in
an
asylum
well
then
remember
him
at
the
wrong
time
there
sit
female
beauty
and
virtue
ready
to
wed
manly
wit
and
comeliness
seated
opposite
see
their
sweet
stolen
glances
a
few
hours
only
between
them
and
wedded
rapture
and
here
to
give
the
lovely
virgin
away
fill
the
bumper
high
vivimus
in
this
glorious
spirit
he
rattled
on
and
soon
drew
the
young
people
out
and
silvery
peals
of
laughter
rang
round
the
genial
board
this
jarred
on
dodd
she
bore
it
in
silence
some
time
but
with
the
grief
it
revived
and
sharpened
by
contrast
and
the
polite
effort
to
hide
her
distress
found
herself
becoming
hysterical
then
she
made
the
usual
signal
to
julia
and
beat
an
early
retreat
she
left
julia
in
the
and
went
and
locked
herself
in
her
own
room
oh
how
can
they
be
so
cruel
as
to
laugh
and
giggle
in
my
david
house
she
wept
sadly
and
for
the
first
time
felt
herself
quite
lonely
in
the
world
for
what
companionship
between
the
gay
and
the
sad
hearted
poor
thing
she
lived
to
reproach
herself
even
with
this
the
nearest
approach
she
ever
made
to
selfishness
ere
long
she
crept
into
julia
room
and
humbly
busied
herself
packing
her
trunks
for
the
wedding
tour
the
tears
fell
fast
on
her
white
hands
she
would
not
have
been
left
alone
a
minute
if
julia
mind
had
not
been
occupied
just
then
with
an
affectionate
and
amiable
anxiety
she
earnestly
desired
to
reconcile
her
alfred
and
his
sister
before
the
wedding
and
she
sat
in
the
thinking
whether
it
could
be
done
and
how
at
last
she
sat
down
blushing
and
wrote
a
little
note
and
rang
the
bell
for
sarah
and
sent
it
courageously
into
the
sarah
very
prudently
listened
at
the
keyhole
before
entering
for
she
said
to
herself
if
they
are
talking
free
i
sha
go
in
till
the
persons
so
generously
suspected
were
discussing
a
parchment
alfred
had
produced
and
wanted
signed
you
are
our
trustee
my
boy
said
he
to
edward
so
just
write
your
name
here
and
mine
comes
here
and
the
witness
there
the
doctor
and
sarah
will
do
send
for
a
let
read
it
first
read
it
what
for
catch
me
signing
a
paper
without
reading
it
my
what
ca
you
trust
me
inquired
alfred
hurt
oh
yes
and
ca
you
trust
me
there
a
question
why
i
have
appointed
you
my
trusty
in
the
deed
he
well
then
trust
me
without
my
signing
and
i
trust
you
without
sampson
laughed
at
this
retort
and
alfred
reddened
he
did
not
want
the
deed
read
but
while
he
hesitated
sarah
came
in
with
julia
note
asking
him
to
come
to
her
for
a
minute
this
sweet
summons
made
him
indifferent
to
prosaic
things
well
read
away
said
he
one
comfort
you
will
be
no
what
is
it
in
latin
asked
edward
with
a
wry
face
no
such
luck
deeds
used
to
be
in
latin
but
latin
could
not
be
made
obscure
enough
so
now
dark
deeds
are
written
in
an
unknown
tongue
called
where
the
sense
is
one
grain
of
wheat
in
two
bushels
of
chaff
pick
it
out
if
you
can
whatever
man
has
done
man
may
do
said
sampson
stoutly
you
have
rid
it
and
yet
understood
it
so
why
may
we
ye
monster
o
conceit
read
it
said
alfred
i
never
read
it
would
not
read
it
for
a
great
deal
of
money
the
moment
i
saw
what
a
senseless
rigmarole
it
was
i
flung
it
down
and
insisted
on
the
battological
author
furnishing
me
with
an
english
translation
he
complied
the
crib
occupies
just
twenty
lines
the
original
three
folio
pages
as
you
see
that
crib
gentlemen
added
he
severely
is
now
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
and
you
shall
never
see
it
for
your
impudence
no
seat
yourself
by
that
pool
of
parchment
sedet
eternumque
sedebit
and
fish
for
lawyer
crawford
ideas
rari
nantes
in
gurgite
and
with
this
he
flew
on
the
wings
of
love
julia
met
him
in
the
middle
of
the
room
all
in
a
flutter
it
is
to
ask
you
a
favour
i
am
unhappy
about
one
she
then
leaned
one
hand
softly
on
his
shoulder
and
curving
her
lovely
supple
neck
looked
round
into
his
face
and
watched
it
as
she
preferred
her
petition
it
is
about
jane
and
you
i
can
not
bear
to
part
you
two
in
this
way
only
think
six
days
you
have
not
spoken
and
i
am
the
not
the
only
cause
i
do
know
darling
but
it
is
very
cruel
i
have
got
my
dear
mother
and
edward
you
have
nobody
but
me
alfred
said
she
with
gentle
impetuosity
now
is
your
time
your
papa
is
oh
is
he
said
alfred
carelessly
yes
sarah
says
betty
says
he
is
gone
to
uncle
thomas
so
i
know
you
wo
refuse
me
my
own
alfred
it
is
to
go
to
your
sister
this
minute
and
make
it
what
and
leave
you
objected
alfred
ruefully
no
no
you
are
with
the
gentlemen
you
know
you
are
not
here
reality
till
tea
make
them
an
excuse
say
the
truth
say
it
is
me
and
come
back
to
me
with
good
he
consented
on
these
terms
then
she
armed
him
with
advice
you
go
to
make
peace
it
is
our
last
chance
now
remember
you
must
be
very
generous
very
guard
against
your
impetuosity
do
take
warning
by
me
see
how
impetuous
i
am
and
then
you
know
after
all
she
is
only
a
lady
and
a
great
creature
like
you
ought
not
to
be
ruffled
by
anything
so
small
as
a
lady
tongue
the
idea
and
dearest
do
go
trusting
to
your
logic
but
descend
to
the
arts
of
persuasion
because
they
are
far
more
convincing
somehow
please
try
yes
enumerate
why
kissing
and
coaxing
and
do
ask
will
you
bestow
a
specimen
of
those
arts
on
me
if
i
succeed
try
me
said
she
and
looked
him
earnestly
in
the
face
but
lowered
her
long
lashes
slowly
and
shyly
as
she
realised
to
what
her
impetuosity
was
pledging
itself
alfred
got
his
hat
and
ran
to
musgrove
cottage
a
man
stepped
out
of
the
shadow
of
a
hedge
opposite
albion
villa
and
followed
him
keeping
in
shadow
as
much
as
possible
the
door
of
musgrove
cottage
was
opened
to
him
by
old
betty
with
a
joyful
start
mr
alfred
i
come
in
there
only

peggy
she
is
turned
away
for
sauce
and
a
good
riddance
of
bad
rubbish
miss
is
in
the
she
ushered
him
triumphantly
in
jane
was
seated
reading
she
dropped
her
book
and
ran
and
kissed
him
with
a
cry
of
joy
so
warm
a
reception
surprised
him
agreeably
and
simplified
his
task
he
told
her
he
was
come
to
try
and
make
it
up
with
her
before
the
wedding
we
lose
your
presence
dear
jenny
said
he
and
that
is
a
great
grief
to
us
valuing
you
as
we
do
do
refuse
us
your
good
wishes
dearest
alfred
said
she
can
you
think
it
i
pray
for
you
day
and
night
and
i
have
begun
to
blame
myself
for
being
so
sure
you
were
in
the
wrong
and
poor
papa
faultless
what
you
sent
me
half
in
jest
i
take
in
earnest
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
why
jenny
said
alfred
how
red
your
eyes
at
this
observation
the
young
saint
laid
her
head
on
her
shoulder
and
had
a
good
cry
like
any
other
girl
when
she
recovered
a
little
she
told
him
yes
she
had
been
very
unhappy
that
he
had
always
been
a
dear
good
brother
to
her
and
the
only
one
she
had
and
that
it
cut
her
to
the
heart
not
to
be
at
his
wedding
it
seemed
so
unkind
alfred
set
her
on
his
knee
she
had
more
soul
than
body
and
kissed
her
and
comforted
her
and
in
this
happy
revival
of
natural
affection
his
heart
opened
he
was
off
his
guard
and
told
her
all
gave
her
the
several
proofs
their
father
had
got
the
jane
arrested
by
the
skill
and
logical
clearness
with
which
he
marshalled
the
proofs
listened
in
silence
and
presently
a
keen
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
and
reminded
him
he
was
setting
a
daughter
against
her
father
there
said
he
i
always
said
i
would
never
tell
you
and
now
done
it
well
at
least
you
will
see
with
what
consideration
and
leniency
the
dodds
for
our
sake
are
treating
richard
hardie
just
compare
their
conduct
to
him
with
his
to
them
and
which
is
most
to
his
advantage
that
i
should
marry
julia
and
give
dodd
the
life
interest
in
my
ten
thousand
pounds
to
balance
his
dishonesty
or
for
him
to
be
indicted
as
a
thief
ned
dodd
told
us
plainly
he
would
have
set
the
police
on
him
had
any
other
but
his
son
been
the
did
say
that
oh
alfred
this
is
a
miserable
i
ca
see
that
it
is
the
jolliest
world
in
the
world
everything
is
bright
and
lovely
and
everybody
is
happy
except
a
few
sick
people
and
a
few
peevish
ones
that
run
to
meet
trouble
i
marry
my
sweet
julia
richard
hardie
will
find
we
two
do
molest
him
nor
trouble
our
heads
about
him
he
will
get
used
to
us
and
one
fine
day
we
shall
say
to
him
we
know
all
about
the
just
leave
it
by
will
to
dear
jenny
and
let
my
friend
dodd
marry
her
and
you
can
enjoy
it
unmolested
for
your
lifetime
he
will
consent
and
you
will
marry
ned
and
then
you
find
the
world
has
been
wickedly
slandered
by
dishonest
men
and
dismal
in
this
strain
he
continued
till
he
made
her
blush
a
good
deal
and
smile
a
little
a
sad
smile
but
at
last
she
said
if
i
was
sure
all
this
is
true
i
think
i
should
go
with
a
heavy
heart
to
your
wedding
if
i
do
the
best
part
of
me
will
be
there
my
prayers
and
my
warm
warm
wishes
for
you
both
kiss
her
for
me
and
tell
her
so
and
that
i
hope
we
shall
meet
round
his
throne
soon
if
we
can
not
meet
at
his
altar
brother
and
sister
then
kissed
one
another
affectionately
and
alfred
ran
back
like
the
wind
to
albion
cottage
julia
was
not
in
the
and
some
coolish
tea
was
after
waiting
half
an
hour
he
got
impatient
and
sent
sarah
to
say
he
had
a
message
for
her
sarah
went
upstairs
to
dodd
room
and
was
instantly
absorbed
after
waiting
again
for
a
long
time
alfred
persuaded
edward
to
try
his
luck
edward
went
up
to
dodd
room
and
was
absorbed
the
wedding
dress
was
being
solemnly
tried
on
a
clean
linen
sheet
was
on
the
floor
and
the
bride
stood
on
it
receiving
the
last
touches
of
the
milliner
art
with
this
and
her
white
poplin
and
lace
veil
she
seemed
framed
in
white
and
her
cheeks
bloomed
so
and
her
eyes
beamed
with
excitement
and
innocent
vanity
that
altogether
she
was
supernaturally
lovely
once
enter
the
room
enchanted
by
this
rose
and
nulla
however
edward
escaped
at
last
and
told
alfred
what
was
on
foot
and
drew
a
picture
of
the
bride
with
white
above
and
white
below
oh
let
me
see
her
implored
the
lover
edward
must
ask
mamma
about
that
he
did
and
mamma
said
certainly
not
the
last
person
in
the
world
that
shall
see
her
in
her
wedding
but
she
should
come
down
to
him
in
half
an
hour
it
seemed
a
very
long
however
by
way
of
compensation
he
was
alone
when
she
did
come
good
news
she
asked
eagerly
capital
we
are
the
best
of
friends
why
she
is
half
inclined
to
then
oh
how
good
you
are
oh
how
i
love
and
she
flung
a
tender
arm
round
his
neck
like
a
young
goddess
making
love
and
her
sweet
face
came
so
near
his
he
had
only
to
stoop
a
little
and
their
lips
met
in
a
long
blissful
kiss
that
kiss
was
an
era
in
her
life
innocence
itself
she
had
put
up
her
delicious
lips
to
her
lover
in
pure
though
earnest
affection
but
the
male
fire
with
which
his
met
them
made
her
blush
as
well
as
thrill
and
she
drew
back
a
little
ashamed
and
half
scared
and
nestled
on
his
shoulder
hiding
a
face
that
grew
redder
and
redder
he
bent
his
graceful
head
and
murmured
down
to
her
are
you
afraid
of
me
sweetest
oh
no
no
yes
a
little
i
do
know
i
was
afraid
i
had
made
too
free
with
my
treasure
you
do
quite
belong
to
me
yet
you
oh
yes
i
do
and
what
is
more
you
belong
to
me
do
you
sweet
rebel
ah
that
i
do
heart
and
soul
my
own
own
a
few
more
soft
delicious
murmurs
and
then
julia
was
summoned
to
more
rites
of
vanity
and
the
lovers
parted
with
tender
reluctance
for
those
few
hours
alfred
went
home
to
his
lodgings
he
had
not
been
there
above
ten
minutes
when
he
came
out
hastily
and
walked
quickly
to
the
white
lion
the
principal
inn
in
barkington
he
went
into
the
and
said
a
few
words
to
the
ostler
then
returned
to
his
lodgings
the
man
followed
him
at
a
distance
from
albion
terrace
watched
him
home
dogged
him
to
the
white
lion
and
entered
the
yard
and
offered
the
ostler
a
glass
of
ale
at
the
tap
at
albion
villa
they
were
working
on
julia
dresses
till
past
midnight
and
then
dodd
insisted
on
her
going
to
bed
she
obeyed
but
when
the
house
was
all
quiet
came
stealing
out
to
her
mother
and
begged
to
sleep
with
her
the
sad
mother
strained
her
in
a
tearful
embrace
and
so
they
passed
the
night
clinging
to
one
another
more
as
the
parting
drew
near
edward
arranged
the
wedding
breakfast
for
after
the
ceremony
and
sent
the
ladies
up
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
toast
apiece
they
could
hardly
find
appetite
even
for
this
or
indeed
time
there
was
so
much
still
to
do
at
ten
julia
was
still
in
the
height
of
dressing
delayed
by
upon
sarah
and
her
sister
did
her
hair
up
too
loose
and
being
a
glorious
mass
it
threatened
all
to
come
down
and
meantime
a
quietly
but
persistently
bored
her
poll
oh
run
for
mamma
she
cried
mamma
came
half
dressed
had
the
hair
all
down
again
and
did
it
up
with
adroit
and
loving
hand
and
put
on
the
orange
wreath
kissed
her
admiringly
and
retired
to
her
own
toilet
and
the
girls
began
to
lace
the
bride
body
bump
came
edward
foot
against
the
door
making
them
all
shriek
now
i
do
want
to
hurry
you
but
sampson
is
the
handmaids
flustered
tried
to
go
faster
and
when
the
work
was
done
julia
took
her
little
handglass
and
inspected
her
back
oh
she
screamed
i
am
crooked
there
go
for
mamma
mamma
soon
came
and
the
poor
bride
held
out
imploring
hands
i
all
awry
i
as
crooked
as
a
ram
la
miss
said
sarah
it
only
behind
nobody
will
notice
how
can
they
help
it
mamma
i
deformed
dodd
smiled
superior
and
bade
her
be
calm
it
is
the
lacing
dear
no
sarah
it
is
no
use
your
it
all
the
pulling
in
the
world

not
straighten
it
i
thought
so
you
have
missed
the
second
top
julia
little
foot
began
to
beat
a
tattoo
on
the
floor
there
is
not
a
soul
in
the
house
but
you
can
do
the
simplest
thing
eyes
and
no
eyes
fingers
and
no
fingers
i
never
hush
love
we
all
do
our
oh
i
am
sure
of
that
poor

dodd
bump
now
i
do
want
to
hurry
any
man
cattle
but
the
bridesmaids

oh
dear
i
shall
never
be

said
julia
and
the
tattoo
recommenced
plenty
of
time
love
said
dodd
quietly
lacing
not
ten
yet
sarah
go
and
see
if
the
bridegroom
has
sarah
returned
with
the
reassuring
tidings
that
the
bridegroom
had
not
yet
arrived
though
the
carriages
had
oh
thank
heaven
is
not
come
said
julia
if
i
keep
him
waiting
he
might
say
under
dread
of
a
comment
so
significant
she
was
ready
at
last
and
said
majestically
he
might
come
now
whenever
he
liked
meantime
down
stairs
an
uneasiness
of
the
opposite
kind
was
growing
ten
minutes
past
the
appointed
time
and
the
bridegroom
not
there
so
while
julia
now
full
dressed
and
easy
in
her
mind
was
directing
sarah
sister
to
lay
out
her
plain
travelling
dress
bonnet
and
gloves
on
the
bed
dodd
was
summoned
downstairs
she
came
down
with
julia
white
gloves
in
her
hand
and
a
needle
and
thread
the
button
sewed
on
by
trade
fair
hand
having
flown
at
the
first
strain
edward
met
her
on
the
stairs
what
had
we
better
do
mother
said
he
voce
there
must
be
some
mistake
can
you
remember
was
he
to
call
for
me
on
the
way
to
the
church
i
really
do
not
know
said
dodd
is
he
at
the
church
do
you
think
no
no
either
he
was
to
call
for
me
here
or
i
for
him
i
go
to
the
church
though
it
is
only
a
he
ran
off
and
in
a
little
more
than
five
minutes
came
into
the
no
he
is
not
there
i
must
go
to
his
lodgings
confound
him
he
has
got
reading
aristotle
i
this
passed
before
the
whole
party
julia
excepted
sampson
looked
at
his
watch
and
said
he
could
conduct
the
ladies
to
the
church
while
edward
went
for
alfred
division
of
labour
said
he
gallantly
and
mine
the
delightful
dodd
demurred
to
the
plan
she
was
for
waiting
quietly
in
one
place
well
but
said
edward
we
may
overdo
that
here
it
is
a
eleven
and
you
know
they
ca
be
married
after
twelve
no
i
really
think
you
had
better
all
go
with
the
doctor
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
there
as
soon
as
you
this
was
agreed
on
after
some
discussion
edward
however
to
provide
against
all
contingencies
begged
sampson
not
to
wait
for
him
should
alfred
reach
the
church
by
some
other
road
i
only
groomsman
you
know
said
he
he
ran
off
at
a
racing
pace
the
bride
was
then
summoned
admired
and
handed
into
one
carriage
with
her
two
bridesmaids
miss
bosanquet
and
miss
darton
sampson
and
dodd
went
in
the
other
and
by
eleven
they
were
all
safe
in
the
church
a
good
many
people
high
and
low
were
about
the
door
and
in
the
pews
waiting
to
see
the
beautiful
miss
dodd
married
to
the
son
of
a
personage
once
so
popular
as
hardie
it
had
even
transpired
that
hardie
disapproved
the
match
they
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
and
were
beginning
to
wonder
what
was
the
matter
when
at
last
the
bride
party
walked
up
the
aisle
with
a
bright
april
sun
shining
on
them
through
the
broad
old
windows
the
bride
rare
beauty
and
carriage
of
her
head
imperial
in
its
loveliness
and
orange
wreath
drew
a
hum
of
admiration
the
party
stood
a
minute
or
two
at
the
east
end
of
the
church
and
then
the
clergyman
came
out
and
invited
them
into
the
vestry
their
reappearance
was
eagerly
expected
in
silence
at
first
but
presently
in
loud
and
multitudinous
whispers
at
this
moment
a
young
lady
with
almost
perfect
features
and
figure
modestly
dressed
in
silk
but
with
a
new
chip
bonnet
and
white
gloves
entered
a
pew
near
the
west
door
and
said
a
little
prayer
then
proceeded
up
the
aisle
and
exchanged
a
word
with
the
clerk
then
into
the
vestry
cheep
cheep
cheep
went
fifty
female
tongues
and
the
arrival
of
the
bridegroom
sister
became
public
news
the
bride
welcomed
her
in
the
vestry
with
a
sweet
guttural
of
surprise
and
delight
and
they
kissed
one
another
like
little
tigers
oh
my
darling
jane
how
kind
of
you
have
i
got
you
back
to
make
my
happiness
complete
now
none
of
her
own
party
had
thought
it
wise
to
tell
julia
there
was
any
hitch
but
miss
hardie
blurted
out
naturally
enough
but
alfred
i
do
know
dear
said
julia
innocently
are
not
he
and
edward
in
another
part
of
the
church
i
thought
we
were
waiting
till
twelve
perhaps
mamma
dear
you
know
everything
i
suppose
this
is
all
right
then
looking
round
at
her
friends
faces
she
saw
in
a
moment
that
it
was
all
wrong
sampson
in
particular
was
burning
with
manly
indignation
and
even
her
mother
discomposed
and
trying
to
smile
when
the
innocent
saw
this
she
suspected
her
beloved
was
treating
her
cavalierly
and
her
poor
little
mouth
began
to
work
and
she
had
much
ado
not
to
whimper
dodd
to
encourage
her
told
her
not
to
be
put
out
it
had
been
arranged
all
along
that
edward
should
go
for
him
unfortunately
we
had
an
impression
it
was
the
other
way
but
now
edward
is
gone
to
his
no
mamma
said
julia
alfred
was
to
call
for
edward
because
our
house
was
on
the
are
you
sure
my
child
asked
dodd
very
gravely
oh
yes
mamma
said
julia
beginning
to
tremble
at
a
quarter
before
eleven
i
heard
them
settle
the
matter
was
terribly
serious
now
indeed
it
began
to
look
hopeless
weather
overclouded
falling
and
hard
upon
twelve
they
all
looked
at
one
another
in
despair
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
long
buzzing
heard
outside
and
the
house
of
god
turned
into
a
gossiping
fair
talk
of
money
changers
said
satan
that
day
give
the
exchangers
of
small
thank
heaven
they
are
come
said
dodd
but
having
thus
relieved
her
mind
she
drew
herself
up
and
prepared
a
freezing
reception
for
the
defaulter
a
whisper
reached
their
excited
ears
it
is
young
dodd
and
next
moment
edward
came
into
the
vestry
alone
the
sight
of
him
was
enough
his
brow
wet
with
perspiration
his
face
black
and
white
with
bitter
wrath
come
home
people
he
said
sternly
there
will
be
no
wedding
here
the
bridesmaids
cackled
questions
at
him
he
turned
his
back
on
them
dodd
knew
her
son
face
too
well
to
waste
inquiries
give
me
my
child
she
cried
in
such
a
burst
of
mother
anguish
long
restrained
that
even
the
insult
to
the
bride
was
forgotten
for
one
moment
till
she
was
seen
tottering
into
her
mother
arms
and
cringing
and
trying
to
hide
bodily
in
her
oh
throw
a
shawl
over
me
she
moaned
hide
all
well
they
all
did
what
they
could
jane
hung
round
her
neck
and
sobbed
and
said
i
a
sister
now
and
no
the
bridesmaids
cried
the
young
curate
ran
and
got
the
fly
to
the
get
into
it
he
said
and
you
will
at
least
escape
the
curious
god
bless
you
hurd
said
edward
half
choked
he
hurried
the
insulted
bride
and
her
mother
in
julia
huddled
and
shrank
into
a
corner
under
dodd
shawl
dodd
had
all
the
blinds
down
in
a
moment
and
they
went
home
as
from
a
funeral
ay
and
a
funeral
it
was
for
the
sweetest
girl
in
england
buried
her
hopes
her
laugh
her
may
of
youth
in
that
church
that
day
when
she
got
to
albion
villa
she
cast
a
wild
look
all
around
for
fear
she
should
be
seen
in
her
wedding
clothes
and
darted
moaning
into
the
house
sarah
met
her
in
the
hall
smirking
and
saying
wish
you
j
the
poor
bride
screamed
fearfully
at
the
mocking
words
and
cut
the
conventional
phrase
in
two
as
with
a
razor
then
fled
to
her
own
room
and
tore
off
her
wreath
her
veil
her
pearls
and
had
already
strewed
the
room
when
dodd
with
a
foot
quickened
by
affection
burst
in
and
caught
her
half
fainting
and
laid
her
weary
as
old
age
and
cold
as
a
stone
upon
her
mother
bosom
and
rocked
her
as
in
the
days
of
happy
childhood
never
to
return
and
bedewed
the
pale
face
with
her
own
tears
sampson
took
the
bridesmaids
each
to
her
residence
on
purpose
to
leave
edward
free
he
came
home
washed
his
face
and
sick
at
heart
but
more
master
of
himself
knocked
timidly
at
julia
door
come
in
son
said
a
broken
voice
he
crept
in
and
saw
a
sorry
sight
the
travelling
dress
and
bonnet
were
waiting
still
on
the
bed
the
bridal
wreath
and
veil
lay
on
the
floor
and
so
did
half
the
necklace
and
the
rest
of
the
pearls
all
about
the
floor
and
julia
with
all
her
hair
loose
and
hanging
below
her
waist
lay
faintly
quivering
in
her
mother
arms
edward
stood
and
looked
and
groaned
dodd
whispered
to
him
over
julia
not
a
tear
not
a
tear
dead
or
false
moaned
the
girl
dead
or
false
oh
that
i
could
believe
he
was
false
no
no
he
is
dead
dodd
whispered
again
over
her
girl
tell
her
something
give
us
tears
the
world
for
one
tear
what
shall
i
say
gasped
edward
tell
her
the
truth
and
trust
to
god
whose
child
she
edward
knelt
on
the
floor
and
took
her
hand
my
poor
little
ju
he
said
in
a
voice
broken
with
pity
and
emotion
would
you
rather
have
him
dead
or
false
to
you
false
a
thousand
times
it
edward
bless
your
sweet
face
my
own
own
brother
tell
me
he
is
false
and
not
come
to
deadly
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
he
groaned
i
went
to
his
lodgings
he
had
left
the
town
the
woman
told
me
a
letter
came
for
him
last
night
a
letter
in
a
female
hand
the
scoundrel
came
in
from
us
got
this
letter
packed
up
his
things
directly
paid
his
lodging
and
went
off
in
a
fly
at
eight
in
the
chapter
xxx
at
these
plain
proofs
of
alfred
infidelity
julia
sweet
throat
began
to
swell
hysterically
and
then
her
bosom
to
heave
and
pant
and
after
a
piteous
struggle
came
a
passion
of
sobs
and
tears
so
wild
so
that
edward
blamed
himself
bitterly
for
telling
her
but
dodd
sobbed
no
no
i
would
rather
have
her
so
only
leave
her
with
me
now
bless
you
darling
leave
us
she
rocked
and
nursed
her
deserted
child
hours
and
hours
and
so
the
miserable
day
crawled
to
its
close
downstairs
the
house
looked
strange
and
gloomy
she
who
had
brightened
it
all
was
darkened
herself
the
wedding
breakfast
and
flowers
remained
in
bitter
mockery
sarah
cleared
half
the
table
and
sampson
and
edward
dined
in
moody
silence
presently
sampson
eye
fell
upon
the
deed
it
lay
on
a
small
table
with
a
pen
beside
it
to
sign
on
their
return
from
church
sampson
got
hold
of
it
and
dived
in
the
verbiage
he
came
up
again
with
a
discovery
in
spite
of
its
feebleness
verbosity
obscurity
and
idiotic
way
of
expressing
itself
the
deed
managed
to
convey
to
david
and
dodd
a
life
interest
in
nine
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
with
reversion
to
julia
and
the
children
of
the
projected
marriage
sampson
and
edward
put
their
heads
over
this
and
it
puzzled
them
why
man
said
sampson
if
the
puppy
had
signed
this
last
night
he
would
be
a
beggar
ay
said
edward
but
after
all
he
did
not
sign
nay
but
that
was
your
fault
not
his
the
lad
was
keen
to
that
is
true
and
perhaps
if
we
had
pinned
him
to
this
last
night
he
would
not
have
dared
insult
my
sister
sampson
changed
the
subject
by
inquiring
suddenly
which
way
he
was
gone
curse
him
i
do
know
and
do
care
go
where
he
will
i
shall
meet
him
again
some
day
and
then
edward
spoke
almost
in
a
whisper
but
a
certain
grind
of
his
white
teeth
and
flashing
of
his
lion
eyes
made
the
incomplete
sentence
very
expressive
what
ninnies
you
young
men
are
said
the
doctor
even
you
that
i
dub
fathom
o
good
sense
just
finish
your
denner
and
come
with
no
doctor
i
off
my
feed
for
once
if
you
had
been
upstairs
and
seen
my
poor
sister
hang
the
grub
it
turns
my
and
he
shoved
his
plate
away
and
leaned
over
the
back
of
his
chair
sampson
made
him
drink
a
glass
of
wine
and
then
they
got
up
from
the
meal
and
went
hurriedly
to
alfred
lodgings
the
doctor
though
sixty
rushing
along
with
all
the
fire
and
buoyancy
of
early
youth
they
found
the
landlady
surrounded
by
gossips
curious
as
themselves
and
longing
to
chatter
but
no
materials
the
one
new
fact
they
elicited
was
that
the
vehicle
was
a
white
lion
fly
for
she
knew
the
young
man
by
the
cast
in
his
eye
come
away
shouted
the
doctor
unceremoniously
and
in
two
minutes
they
were
in
the
yard
of
the
white
lion
sampson
called
the
ostler
out
came
a
man
with
a
strong
squint
sampson
concluded
this
was
his
man
and
said
roughly
where
did
you
drive
young
hardie
this
morning
he
seemed
rather
taken
aback
by
this
abrupt
question
but
reflected
and
slapped
his
thigh
why
that
is
the
party
from
mill
druv
him
to
silverton
station
sir
and
was
long
about
it
either
gent
was
in
a
what
train
did
he
go
by
well
i
do
know
sir
i
left
him
at
the
well
then
where
did
he
take
his
ticket
for
where
did
he
tell
the
porter
he
was
going
think
now
and
i
give
y
a
the
ostler
scratched
his
head
and
seemed
at
first
inclined
to
guess
for
the
sovereign
but
at
last
said
i
should
only
be
robbing
you
gents
ye
see
he
paid
the
fly
then
and
there
and
gave
me
a
crown
and
i
druv
away
on
this
they
gave
him
a
shilling
and
left
him
but
on
leaving
the
yard
edward
said
doctor
i
do
like
that
fellow
looks
let
us
try
the
they
went
into
the
bar
and
made
similar
inquiries
the
landlord
was
out
the
mistress
knew
nothing
about
it
but
took
a
book
out
of
a
drawer
and
turned
over
the
leaves
she
read
out
an
entry
to
this
effect
pair
horse
fly
to
silverton
take
up
in
mill
street
at
eight
is
that
it
sir
sampson
assented
but
edward
told
her
the
ostler
said
it
was
silverton
station
no
it
is
silverton
in
the
book
sir
well
you
see
it
is
all
one
to
us
the
station
is
further
than
the
town
but
we
charge
seven
miles
whichever
is
bradshaw
inspected
then
and
there
sought
in
vain
to
conceal
that
four
trains
reach
silverton
from
different
points
between
and
the
friends
retired
with
this
scanty
information
alfred
could
hardly
have
gone
to
london
for
there
was
a
train
up
from
barkington
itself
at
but
he
might
have
gone
to
almost
any
other
part
of
the
island
or
out
of
it
for
that
matter
sampson
fell
into
a
brown
study
after
a
long
silence
which
edward
was
too
sad
to
break
he
said
thoughtfully
bring
sceince
to
bear
on
this
facks
are
never
really
opposed
to
facks
they
onnly
seem
to
be
and
the
true
solution
is
the
one
which
riconciles
all
the
facks
for
instance
the
chronothairmal
therey
riconciles
all
th
undisputed
facks
in
midicine
so
now
sairch
for
a
solution
to
riconcile
the
deed
with
the
puppy
edward
searched
but
could
find
none
and
said
so
ca
you
said
sampson
then
i
give
you
a
couple
say
he
is
touched
in
the
upper
story
for
what
do
you
mean
mad
oh
there
are
degrees
of
phrinzy
here
is
th
inconsistency
of
conduct
that
marks
a
disturbance
of
the
reason
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
once
knew
a
young
fellow
that
played
this
very
prank
at
a
wedding
and
the
nixt
thing
we
hard
my
lorrd
was
in
edward
shook
his
head
it
is
the
villain
heart
not
his
sampson
then
offered
another
solution
in
which
he
owned
he
had
more
confidence
he
has
been
courting
some
other
wumman
first
she
declined
or
made
believe
but
when
she
found
he
had
the
spirit
to
go
and
marry
an
innocent
girl
then
the
jade
wrote
to
him
and
yielded
it
a
married
one
likely
i
known
women
go
further
for
hatred
of
a
wumman
than
they
would
for
love
of
a
man
and
here
was
a
temptation
to
snap
a
lover
off
th
altar
and
insult
a
rival
all
at
one
blow
he
meant
to
marry
he
meant
to
sign
that
deed
ay
and
at
his
age
even
if
he
had
signed
it
he
would
have
gone
off
at
passion
call
and
beggared
himself
what
enrages
me
is
that
we
did
let
him
sign
it
and
so
nail
the
young
rascal
curse
his
money
said
edward
and
him
too
wait
till
i
can
lay
my
hand
on
him
i
break
every
bone
in
his
and
i
help
in
the
morning
dodd
left
julia
for
a
few
minutes
expressly
to
ask
sampson
advice
after
alfred
conduct
she
was
free
and
fully
determined
to
defend
herself
and
family
against
spoliation
by
any
means
in
her
power
so
she
now
showed
the
doctor
david
letter
about
the
and
the
empty
and
put
together
the
disjointed
evidence
of
julia
alfred
and
circumstances
in
one
neat
and
luminous
statement
sampson
was
greatly
struck
with
the
revelation
he
jumped
off
his
chair
and
marched
about
excited
said
truth
was
stranger
than
fiction
and
this
was
a
manifest
swindle
then
he
surprised
dodd
in
her
turn
by
assuming
that
old
hardie
was
at
the
bottom
of
business
neither
edward
nor
his
mother
could
see
that
and
said
so
his
reply
was
characteristic
of
course
you
ca
you
are
anglosaxins
anglosaxins
are
good
at
drawing
distinctions
but
they
ca
gineralise
i
a
celt
and
gineralise
as
a
duck
swims
i
discovered
th
unity
of
all
disease
it
would
be
odd
if
i
could
not
trace
the
maniform
iniquities
you
suffer
to
their
one
but
what
is
the
connecting
link
asked
dodd
still
incredulous
why
richard
hardie
well
but
the
letter
objected
edward
there
goes
th
anglosaxin
again
remonstrated
sampson
puzzling
his
head
over
petty
details
and
they
are
perhaps
mere
blinds
thrown
out
by
the
enemy
put
this
and
that
together
hardie
senior
always
averse
to
this
marriage
hardie
senior
wanting
to
keep
of
yours
if
his
son
who
knows
of
the
fraud
became
your
mother
son
the
swinidle
would
be
hourly
in
danger
no
connection
y
unhappy
anglosaxins
why
the
two
things
are
interwoven
and
so
young
hardie
is
got
out
of
the
way
old
hardie
doing
or
i
a
this
reasoning
still
appeared
forced
and
fanciful
to
edward
but
it
began
to
make
some
little
impression
on
dodd
and
encouraged
her
to
own
that
her
poor
daughter
suspected
foul
play
well
that
is
possible
too
whativer
tempted
man
has
done
tempted
man
will
do
but
more
likely
he
has
bribed
jezebel
to
write
and
catch
the
goose
by
the
heart
gintlennen
i
a
bit
of
a
physiognomist
look
at
old
hardie
lines
his
cords
i
might
say
and
deeper
every
time
i
see
him
sirs
there
an
awful
weight
on
that
man
mind
looksee
just
send
a
small
trifle
of
a
detective
down
to
watch
his
game
and
pump
his
people
and
as
soon
as
it
is
safe
we
seize
the
old
bird
and
once
he
is
trapped
the
young
one
will
reappear
like
magic
th
old
one
will
disgorge
we
just
compound
the
felony
been
an
old
friend
and
recover
the
a
fine
sketch
but
edward
thought
it
desperately
wild
and
dodd
preferred
employing
a
respectable
attorney
to
try
and
obtain
justice
in
the
regular
way
sampson
laughed
at
her
what
was
the
use
of
attacking
in
the
regular
way
an
irregular
genius
like
old
hardie
attorneys
are
too
humdrum
for
such
a
job
said
he
they
start
with
a
civil
letter
putting
a
rogue
on
his
guard
they
proceed
t
a
writ
and
then
he
digs
a
hole
in
another
county
and
buries
the
booty
or
sails
t
australia
with
it
i
an
old
friend
and
an
insane
lover
of
justice
i
say
insane
because
my
passion
is
not
returned
or
the
jade
would
keep
out
of
my
way
so
all
these
years
you
leave
all
this
to
stop
a
minute
said
edward
you
must
not
go
compromising
us
and
we
have
no
money
to
pay
for
luxuries
like
i
wo
compromise
any
one
of
you
and
my
detective
sha
cost
y
a
ah
my
dear
friend
said
dodd
the
fact
is
you
do
not
know
all
the
difficulties
that
beset
us
tell
him
edward
well
then
let
the
poor
boy
is
attached
to
this
gentleman
daughter
whom
you
propose
to
treat
like
a
felon
and
he
is
too
good
a
son
and
too
good
a
friend
for
me
to
what
what
shall
i
do
edward
coloured
up
to
the
eyes
who
told
you
that
mother
said
he
well
yes
i
do
love
her
and
i
not
ashamed
of
it
doctor
said
the
poor
fellow
after
a
while
i
see
now
i
am
not
quite
the
person
to
advise
my
mother
in
this
matter
i
consent
to
leave
it
in
your
and
in
pursuance
of
this
resolution
he
retired
to
his
study
there
a
damnable
combination
said
sampson
drily
truth
is
sairtainly
more
wonderful
than
feckshin
here
my
fathom
o
good
sense
in
love
with
a
wax
doll
and
her
brother
jilting
his
sister
and
her
father
pillaging
his
mother
it
dodd
denied
the
wax
doll
but
owned
miss
hardie
was
open
to
vast
objections
an
inestimable
young
lady
but
so
odd
she
is
one
of
these
christians
that
have
sprung
up
a
religious
egotist
and
imaginaire
eternally
feeling
her
own
spiritual
pulse
i
know
the
disorrder
cried
sampson
eagerly
the
pashints
have
a
hot
fit
and
then
they
are
saints
followed
in
due
course
by
the
cold
fit
and
then
they
are
the
worst
of
sinners
and
so
on
in
endless
rotation
and
if
they
could
only
realise
my
great
discovery
the
perriodicity
of
all
disease
and
time
their
sintiments
they
would
find
the
hot
fit
and
the
cold
return
chronometrically
at
intervals
as
rigular
as
the
tide
ebb
and
flow
and
the
soul
has
nothing
to
do
with
either
febrile
symptom
why
religion
apart
from
intermittent
fever
of
the
brain
is
just
the
caumest
peaceablest
sedatest
thing
in
all
the
ah
you
are
too
deep
for
me
my
good
friend
all
i
know
is
that
she
is
one
of
this
new
school
whom
i
take
the
liberty
to
call
fidgety
christians
they
can
not
let
their
poor
souls
alone
a
minute
and
they
pester
one
day
and
night
with
the
millennium
as
if
we
shall
not
all
be
dead
long
before
that
but
the
worst
is
they
apply
the
language
of
earthly
passion
to
the
saviour
of
mankind
and
make
one
flesh
creep
at
their
blasphemies
so
coarse
so
familiar
like
that
rude
multitude
which
thronged
and
pressed
him
when
on
earth
but
after
all
she
came
to
the
church
and
took
my
julia
part
so
that
shows
she
has
and
do
pray
spare
me
her
feelings
in
any
step
you
take
against
that
dishonourable
person
her
father
i
must
go
back
to
his
victim
my
poor
poor
child
i
dare
not
leave
her
long
oh
doctor
such
a
night
and
if
she
dozes
for
a
minute
it
is
to
wake
with
a
scream
and
tell
me
she
sees
him
dead
sometimes
he
is
drowned
sometimes
stained
with
blood
but
always
this
evening
hardie
came
along
in
a
fly
with
his
luggage
on
the
box
returning
to
musgrove
cottage
as
from
yorkshire
in
passing
albion
villa
he
cast
it
a
look
of
vindictive
triumph
he
got
home
and
nodded
by
the
fire
in
his
character
of
a
man
wearied
by
a
long
journey
jane
made
him
some
tea
and
told
him
how
alfred
had
disappeared
on
his
the
young
scamp
said
he
he
added
coolly
it
is
no
business
of
mine
i
had
no
hand
in
making
the
match
thank
in
the
conversation
that
ensued
he
said
he
had
always
been
averse
to
the
marriage
but
not
so
irreconcilably
as
to
approve
this
open
breach
of
faith
with
a
respectable
young
lady
this
will
recoil
upon
our
name
you
know
at
this
critical
time
said
he
then
jane
mustered
courage
to
confess
that
she
had
gone
to
the
wedding
herself
dear
papa
said
she
it
was
made
clear
to
me
that
the
dodds
are
acting
in
what
they
consider
a
most
friendly
way
to
you
they
think
i
can
not
tell
you
what
they
think
but
if
mistaken
they
are
sincere
and
so
after
prayer
and
you
not
being
here
for
me
to
consult
i
did
go
to
the
church
forgive
me
papa
i
have
but
one
brother
and
she
is
my
dear
hardie
countenance
fell
at
this
announcement
and
he
looked
almost
diabolical
but
on
second
thoughts
he
cleared
up
wonderfully
i
will
be
frank
with
you
jenny
if
the
wedding
had
come
off
i
should
have
been
deeply
hurt
at
your
supporting
that
little
monster
of
ingratitude
he
not
only
marries
against
his
father
will
that
is
done
every
day
but
slanders
and
maligns
him
publicy
in
his
hour
of
poverty
and
distress
but
now
that
he
has
broken
faith
and
insulted
miss
dodd
as
well
as
me
i
declare
i
am
glad
you
were
there
jenny
it
will
separate
us
from
his
abominable
conduct
but
what
does
he
say
for
himself
what
reason
does
he
give
oh
it
is
all
mystery
as
well
but
he
must
have
sent
some
explanation
to
the
he
may
have
i
do
know
i
have
not
ventured
to
intrude
on
my
poor
insulted
friend
papa
i
hear
her
distress
is
fearful
they
fear
for
her
reason
oh
if
harm
comes
to
her
god
will
assuredly
punish
him
whose
heartlessness
and
treachery
has
brought
her
to
it
mark
my
words
she
continued
with
great
emotion
this
cruel
act
will
not
go
unpunished
even
in
this
there
there
change
the
subject
said
hardie
peevishly
what
have
i
to
do
with
his
pranks
he
has
disowned
me
for
his
father
and
i
disown
him
for
my
the
next
day
peggy
black
called
and
asked
to
see
master
old
betty
after
the
first
surprise
looked
at
her
from
head
to
foot
and
foot
to
head
as
if
measuring
her
for
a
suit
of
disdain
and
told
her
she
might
carry
her
own
message
then
flounced
into
the
kitchen
and
left
her
to
shut
the
street
door
which
she
did
she
went
and
dropped
her
curtsey
at
the
parlour
door
and
in
a
miminy
piminy
voice
said
she
was
come
to
make
her
submission
and
would
he
forgive
her
and
give
her
another
trial
her
penitence
after
one
or
two
convulsive
efforts
ended
in
a
very
fair
flow
of
tears
hardie
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
asked
jane
if
the
girl
had
ever
been
saucy
to
her
oh
no
papa
indeed
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
poor
well
then
go
to
your
work
and
try
and
not
offend
betty
remember
she
is
older
than
peggy
went
for
her
box
and
bandbox
and
reinstated
herself
quietly
and
all
old
betty
endeavours
to
irritate
her
only
elicited
a
calm
cunning
smile
with
a
depression
of
her
downy
eyelashes
next
morning
edward
dodd
was
woke
out
of
a
sound
sleep
at
about
four
by
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
he
looked
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
it
was
julia
standing
by
his
bedside
dressed
and
in
her
bonnet
edward
she
said
in
a
hurried
whisper
there
is
foul
play
i
can
not
sleep
i
can
not
be
idle
he
has
been
decoyed
away
and
perhaps
murdered
oh
pray
get
up
and
go
to
the
police
office
or
somewhere
with
very
well
but
wait
till
no
now
now
now
now
i
shall
never
go
out
of
doors
in
the
daytime
again
wait
i
going
crazy
with
wait
wait
wait
wait
her
hand
was
like
fire
on
him
and
her
eyes
supernaturally
bright
there
said
edward
with
a
groan
go
downstairs
and
i
will
be
with
you
he
came
down
they
went
out
together
her
little
burning
hand
pinched
his
tight
and
her
swift
foot
seemed
scarcely
to
touch
the
ground
she
kept
him
at
his
full
stride
till
they
got
to
the
central
police
station
there
at
the
very
thought
of
facing
men
the
fiery
innocent
suddenly
shrank
together
and
covered
her
blushing
face
with
her
hot
hands
she
sent
him
in
alone
he
found
an
intelligent
superintendent
who
entered
into
the
case
with
all
the
coolness
of
an
old
official
hand
edward
came
out
to
his
sister
and
as
he
hurried
her
home
told
her
what
had
passed
the
superintendent
asked
to
see
the
letter
i
told
him
he
had
taken
it
with
him
that
was
a
pity
he
said
then
he
made
me
describe
alfred
to
a
nicety
and
the
description
will
go
up
to
london
this
morning
and
all
over
barkington
and
the
neighbourhood
and
the
she
stopped
to
kiss
him
then
went
on
again
with
her
head
down
and
neither
spoke
till
they
were
nearly
home
then
edward
told
her
the
superintendent
felt
quite
sure
that
the
villain
was
not
dead
nor
in
danger
of
oh
bless
him
bless
him
for
saying
and
that
he
will
turn
up
in
london
before
very
long
not
in
this
neighbourhood
he
says
he
must
have
known
the
writer
of
the
letter
and
his
taking
his
luggage
with
him
shows
he
has
gone
off
deliberately
my
poor
little
ju
now
do
try
and
look
at
it
as
he
does
and
everybody
else
does
try
and
see
it
as
you
would
if
you
were
a
she
laid
her
soft
hand
on
his
shoulder
as
if
to
support
herself
floating
in
her
sea
of
doubt
i
do
see
i
am
a
poor
credulous
girl
but
how
can
my
alfred
be
false
to
me
am
i
to
doubt
the
bible
am
i
to
doubt
the
sun
is
nothing
true
in
heaven
or
earth
oh
if
i
could
only
have
died
as
i
was
dressing
for
church
died
while
he
seemed
true
he
true
the
wicked
creature
has
cast
some
spell
on
him
he
has
gone
in
a
moment
of
delirium
he
will
regret
what
he
has
done
perhaps
regrets
it
now
i
am
ungrateful
to
you
edward
and
to
the
good
policeman
for
saying
he
is
not
dead
what
more
do
i
require
he
is
dead
to
me
edward
let
us
leave
this
place
we
going
let
us
go
this
very
day
oh
take
me
and
hide
me
where
no
one
that
knows
me
can
ever
see
me
a
flood
of
tears
came
to
her
relief
and
she
went
along
sobbing
and
kissing
her
brother
hand
every
now
and
then
but
as
they
drew
near
the
gate
of
albion
villa
twilight
began
to
usher
in
the
dawn
julia
shuddered
at
even
that
faint
light
and
fled
like
a
guilty
thing
and
hid
herself
sobbing
in
her
own
bedroom
richard
hardie
slept
better
now
than
he
had
done
for
some
time
past
and
therefore
woke
more
refreshed
and
in
better
spirits
he
knew
an
honest
family
was
miserable
a
few
doors
off
but
he
did
not
care
he
got
up
and
shaved
with
a
mind
at
ease
one
morning
when
he
had
removed
the
lather
from
one
half
his
face
he
happened
to
look
out
of
window
and
saw
on
the
wall
opposite
a
placard
a
large
placard
to
this
effect
one
hundred
guineas
reward
whereas
on
the
instant
alfred
hardie
disappeared
mysteriously
from
his
lodgings
in
mill
street
under
circumstances
suggesting
a
suspicion
of
foul
play
know
all
men
that
the
above
reward
will
be
paid
to
any
person
or
persons
who
shall
first
inform
the
undersigned
where
the
said
alfred
hardie
is
to
be
found
and
what
person
or
persons
if
any
have
been
concerned
in
his
disappearance

the
note
alfred
hardie
received
on
the
of
april
was
from
peggy
black
the
letters
were
well
formed
for
she
had
been
educated
at
the
national
school
but
the
style
was
not
upon
a
par
mr
alfred
sir
margaret
black
sends
her
respects
and
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
about
the
money
i
can
tell
you
all
and
where
it
is
at
this
present
time
sir
i
am
now
in
situation
at
silverton
grove
house
about
a
furlong
from
the
station
and
if
you
will
be
so
good
to
call
there
and
ask
for
margaret
i
will
tell
you
where
it
is
which
i
mean
the
for
it
is
a
sin
the
young
lady
should
be
beguiled
of
her
own
only
you
must
please
come
this
evening
or
else
before
ten
by
reason
my
mistress
and
me
we
are
going
up
to
london
that
day
early
and
she
talk
of
taking
me
abroad
along
with
i
remain
sir
yours
respectfully
to
command
margaret
black
if
you
please
sir
not
to
show
this
letter
on
no
alfred
read
this
twice
over
and
felt
a
contemptuous
repugnance
towards
the
writer
a
cashiered
servant
who
offered
to
tell
the
truth
out
of
spite
having
easily
resisted
every
worthy
motive
indeed
i
think
he
would
have
perhaps
dismissed
the
subject
into
the
fire
but
for
a
strange
circumstance
that
had
occurred
to
him
this
very
afternoon
but
i
had
no
opportunity
to
relate
it
till
now
well
just
as
he
was
going
to
dress
for
dinner
he
received
a
visit
from
wycherley
a
gentleman
he
scarcely
knew
by
name
wycherley
inquired
after
his
kephalalgia
alfred
stared
and
told
him
it
was
much
the
same
troubled
him
occasionally
and
your
i
do
know
the
word
have
you
any
authority
for
it
wycherley
smiled
with
a
sort
of
benevolent
superiority
that
galled
his
patient
and
proceeded
to
inquire
after
his
nightly
visions
and
voices
but
at
this
alfred
looked
grave
as
well
as
surprised
and
vexed
he
was
on
his
guard
now
and
asked
himself
seriously
what
was
the
meaning
of
all
this
and
could
his
father
have
been
so
mad
as
to
talk
over
his
own
shame
with
this
stranger
he
made
no
reply
whatever
wycherley
curiosity
was
not
of
a
very
ardent
kind
for
he
was
one
of
those
who
first
form
an
opinion
and
then
collect
the
materials
of
one
and
a
very
little
fact
goes
a
long
way
with
such
minds
so
when
he
got
no
answer
about
the
nocturnal
visions
and
voices
he
glided
calmly
on
to
another
matter
that
alfred
started
and
then
eyed
him
keenly
what
the
fabulous
sum
you
labour
under
the
impression
of
your
father
having
been
guilty
of
clandestinely
this
was
too
much
for
alfred
patience
i
do
know
who
you
are
sir
said
he
i
never
exchanged
but
three
words
in
my
life
with
you
and
do
you
suppose
i
will
talk
to
a
stranger
on
family
matters
of
so
delicate
a
kind
as
this
i
begin
to
think
you
have
intruded
yourself
on
me
simply
to
gratify
an
impertinent
the
hypothesis
is
at
variance
with
my
established
character
replied
the
oleaginous
one
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
in
the
necessity
of
this
investigation
and
that
it
is
one
of
a
most
friendly
then
i
decline
the
double
nuisance
your
curiosity
and
your
friendship
take
them
both
out
of
my
room
sir
or
i
shall
turn
them
both
out
by
one
pair
of
you
shall
smart
for
this
said
the
doctor
driven
to
plain
english
by
anger
that
great
solvent
of
circumlocution
with
which
nature
has
mercifully
supplied
us
he
made
to
the
door
opened
it
and
said
in
considerable
excitement
to
some
one
outside
excited
very
now
pleonast
had
no
sooner
been
converted
to
the
vernacular
and
disappeared
than
another
stranger
entered
the
room
he
had
evidently
been
lurking
in
the
passage
it
was
a
man
of
smallish
stature
singularly
gaunt
angular
and
haggard
but
dressed
in
a
spruce
suit
of
black
tight
new
and
glossy
in
short
he
looked
like
apothecary
gone
to
stultz
with
the
money
he
fluttered
in
with
pale
cheek
and
apprehensive
body
saying
hurriedly
now
my
sir
calm
be
calm
i
have
come
down
all
the
way
from
london
to
see
you
and
i
am
you
wo
make
me
lose
my
journey
will
you
now
and
pray
who
asked
you
to
come
all
the
way
from
london
sir
a
person
to
whom
your
health
is
very
oh
indeed
so
i
have
secret
friends
have
i
well
you
may
tell
my
secret
underhand
i
never
was
better
in
my
i
am
truly
glad
to
hear
it
said
the
little
man
let
me
introduce
myself
as
wycherley
forgot
to
do
and
he
handed
alfred
a
card
on
which
his
name
and
profession
were
written
well
speers
said
alfred
i
have
only
a
moment
to
give
you
for
i
must
dress
for
dinner
what
do
you
want
i
come
sir
in
hopes
of
convincing
your
friends
you
are
not
so
very
ill
not
incurable
why
your
eye
is
steady
your
complexion
good
a
little
high
with
the
excitement
of
this
conversation
but
if
we
can
only
get
over
this
little
delusion
all
will
be
what
little
delusion
about
the
you
what
i
have
not
mentioned
to
you
have
i
no
sir
you
seem
to
shun
it
like
poison
that
is
the
worst
of
it
you
talk
about
it
to
others
fast
enough
but
to
wycherley
and
myself
who
could
cure
you
of
it
you
would
hide
all
about
it
if
you
at
this
alfred
rose
and
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
looked
down
grimly
on
his
inquisitor
mr
speers
said
he
you
had
better
go
there
is
no
credit
to
be
gained
by
throwing
so
small
an
apothecary
as
you
out
of
that
window
and
wo
find
it
pleasant
either
for
if
you
provoke
me
to
it
i
shall
not
stand
upon
ceremony
i
sha
open
the
window
first
as
i
should
for
what
his
confounded
at
these
suggestive
words
spoken
with
suppressed
ire
and
flashing
eyes
speers
scuttled
to
the
door
crabwise
holding
the
young
lion
in
check
conventionally
to
wit
with
an
eye
as
valiant
as
a
sheep
and
a
joyful
apothecary
was
he
when
he
found
himself
safe
outside
the
house
and
beside
wycherley
who
was
waiting
for
him
alfred
soon
cooled
and
began
to
laugh
at
his
own
anger
and
the
unbounded
impudence
of
his
visitors
but
on
the
other
hand
it
struck
him
as
a
grave
circumstance
that
so
able
a
man
as
his
father
should
stir
muddy
water
should
go
and
talk
to
these
strangers
about
the
money
he
had
misappropriated
he
puzzled
himself
all
the
time
he
was
dressing
and
not
to
trouble
the
reader
with
all
the
conjectures
that
passed
through
his
mind
he
concluded
at
last
that
hardie
must
feel
very
strong
very
sure
there
was
no
evidence
against
him
but
his
son
or
he
would
not
take
the
eighth
commandment
by
the
horns
like
this
injustice
carries
it
with
a
high
hand
thought
alfred
with
a
sigh
he
was
not
the
youth
to
imitate
his
father
shamelessness
so
he
locked
this
last
incident
in
his
own
breast
did
not
even
mention
it
to
julia
but
now
on
reading
peggy
note
his
warlike
instincts
awoke
and
though
he
despised
his
correspondent
and
her
motives
he
could
not
let
such
a
chance
pass
of
defeating
brazen
injustice
it
was
unfortunate
and
awkward
to
have
to
go
to
silverton
on
his
wedding
morning
but
after
all
there
was
plenty
of
time
he
packed
up
his
things
at
once
for
the
wedding
tour
and
in
the
morning
took
them
with
him
in
the
fly
to
silverton
his
plan
was
to
come
back
direct
to
albion
villa
so
he
went
to
silverton
grove
full
dressed
all
ready
for
the
wedding
as
it
happened
he
overtook
his
friend
peterson
just
outside
the
town
called
to
him
gaily
and
invited
him
to
church
and
breakfast
to
his
surprise
the
young
gentleman
replied
sullenly
that
he
should
certainly
not
come
not
come
old
fellow
said
alfred
hurt
you
have
a
good
cheek
to
ask
me
retorted
the
other
this
led
to
an
explanation
peterson
complaint
was
that
he
had
told
alfred
he
was
in
love
with
julia
and
alfred
had
gone
directly
and
fallen
in
love
with
her
just
to
cut
him
out
what
are
you
talking
about
said
alfred
so
this
is
the
reason
you
have
kept
away
from
me
of
late
why
i
was
engaged
to
her
at
the
very
time
only
my
father
was
keeping
us
then
why
did
you
say
so
because
my
love
is
not
of
the
prattling
oh
nonsense
i
do
believe
a
word
of
you
do
believe
my
word
did
you
ever
know
me
tell
a
lie
at
that
rate
think
what
you
please
sir
drive
on
and
so
ended
that
little
friendship
on
the
road
our
ardent
youth
arranged
in
his
head
a
noble
scheme
he
would
bring
peggy
black
home
with
him
compensating
her
liberally
for
the
place
she
would
thereby
lose
would
confront
her
privately
with
his
father
and
convince
him
it
was
his
interest
to
restore
the
dodds
their
money
with
a
good
grace
take
the
he
had
already
offered
and
countenance
the
wedding
by
letting
jane
be
present
at
it
it
was
hard
to
do
all
this
in
the
time
but
well
worth
trying
for
and
not
impossible
a
fly
is
not
a
slow
conveyance
and
he
offered
the
man
a
guinea
to
drive
fast
so
that
it
was
not
nine
when
they
reached
silverton
grove
house
a
place
alfred
had
never
heard
of
this
however
i
may
observe
was
no
wonder
for
it
had
not
borne
that
name
a
it
was
a
large
square
mansion
of
red
brick
with
stone
facings
and
corners
and
with
balustrades
that
hid
the
garret
windows
it
stood
in
its
own
grounds
and
the
entrance
was
through
handsome
iron
gates
one
of
which
was
wide
open
to
admit
people
on
foot
or
horseback
the
flyman
got
down
and
tried
to
open
the
other
but
could
not
manage
it
there
do
waste
time
said
alfred
impatiently
let
me
he
found
a
notice
under
the
bell
ring
and
he
rang
accordingly
and
at
the
clang
the
opened
as
if
he
had
pulled
a
porter
along
with
the
bell
and
a
servant
out
of
livery
stood
on
the
steps
to
receive
him
alfred
hurried
across
the
plat
which
was
trimmed
as
neatly
as
a
college
green
and
asked
the
servant
if
he
could
see
margaret
black
margaret
black
said
the
man
doubtfully
i
inquire
sir
please
to
follow
they
entered
a
handsome
hall
with
antlers
and
armour
from
this
a
double
staircase
led
up
to
a
landing
with
folding
doors
in
the
centre
of
it
one
of
these
doors
was
wide
open
like
the
iron
gate
outside
the
servant
showed
alfred
up
the
staircase
through
the
open
door
into
a
spacious
handsomely
though
not
gaily
furnished
and
decorated
but
a
little
darkened
by
venetian
blinds
the
old
servant
walked
gravely
on
and
on
till
alfred
began
to
think
he
would
butt
the
wall
but
he
put
his
hand
out
and
opened
a
door
that
might
very
well
escape
a
stranger
notice
for
it
was
covered
with
and
matched
another
narrow
mirror
in
shape
and
size
this
door
led
into
a
very
long
room
as
plain
and
even
sordid
as
the
was
inviting
the
unpapered
walls
were
a
cold
drab
and
wanted
washing
there
was
a
thick
cobweb
up
in
one
corner
and
from
the
ceiling
hung
the
tail
of
another
which
the
housemaid
broom
had
scotched
not
killed
that
side
of
the
room
they
entered
by
was
all
books
the
servant
said
stay
here
a
moment
sir
and
i
send
her
to
with
this
he
retired
into
the
closing
the
door
softly
after
him
once
closed
it
became
invisible
it
fitted
like
wax
and
left
nothing
to
be
seen
but
books
not
even
a
knob
it
shut
to
with
that
gentle
but
clean
click
which
a
spring
bolt
however
polished
and
oiled
and
gently
closed
will
emit
altogether
it
was
enough
to
give
some
people
a
turn
but
alfred
nerves
were
not
to
be
affected
by
trifles
he
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
quietly
enough
at
first
but
uneasily
confound
her
for
wasting
my
time
thought
he
why
does
she
come
then
as
he
had
learned
to
pick
up
the
fragments
of
time
and
hated
dawdling
he
went
to
take
a
book
from
the
shelves
he
found
it
was
a
piece
of
iron
admirably
painted
it
chilled
his
hand
with
its
unexpected
coldness
and
all
the
books
on
and
about
the
door
were
iron
and
chilly
well
thought
he
this
is
the
first
dummy
ever
took
me
in
what
a
fool
the
man
must
be
why
he
could
have
bought
books
with
ideas
in
them
for
the
price
of
these
still
peggy
did
not
come
so
he
went
to
a
door
opposite
and
at
right
angles
to
the
farthest
window
meaning
to
open
it
and
inquire
after
her
lo
and
behold
he
found
this
was
a
knob
without
a
door
there
had
been
a
door
but
it
was
blocked
up
the
only
available
door
on
that
side
had
a
keyhole
but
no
latch
nor
handle
alfred
was
a
prisoner
he
no
sooner
found
this
out
than
he
began
to
hammer
on
the
door
with
his
fists
and
call
out
this
had
a
good
effect
for
he
heard
a
woman
dress
come
rustling
a
key
was
inserted
and
the
door
opened
but
instead
of
peggy
it
was
a
tall
woman
of
thirty
with
dark
grey
eyes
and
straightish
eyebrows
massive
and
black
as
jet
she
was
dressed
quietly
but
like
a
lady
archbold
for
that
was
her
name
cast
on
alfred
one
of
those
swift
glances
with
which
her
sex
contrive
to
take
in
the
features
character
and
dress
of
a
person
from
head
to
foot
and
smiled
most
graciously
on
him
revealing
a
fine
white
set
of
teeth
she
begged
him
to
take
a
seat
and
sat
down
herself
she
had
left
the
door
ajar
i
came
to
see
margaret
black
said
alfred
margaret
black
there
is
no
such
person
here
was
the
quiet
reply
what
has
she
gone
away
so
early
as
this
archbold
smiled
and
said
soothingly
are
you
sure
she
ever
existed
except
in
your
imagination
alfred
laughed
at
this
and
showed
her
peggy
letter
she
ran
her
eye
over
it
and
returned
it
him
with
a
smile
of
a
different
kind
half
pitying
half
cynical
but
presently
resuming
her
former
manner
i
remember
now
said
she
in
dulcet
tones
the
anxiety
you
are
labouring
under
is
about
a
large
sum
of
money
is
it
not
what
can
you
give
me
any
information
about
it
said
he
surprised
i
think
we
can
render
you
great
in
the
matter
infinite
service
hardie
was
the
reply
in
a
voice
of
very
honey
alfred
was
amazed
at
this
you
say
you
do
know
peggy
and
yet
you
seem
to
know
me
i
never
saw
you
in
my
life
before
madam
what
on
earth
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
calm
yourself
said
archbold
laying
a
white
and
finely
moulded
hand
upon
his
arm
there
is
no
wonder
nor
mystery
in
the
matter
were
the
colour
rushed
into
alfred
face
and
he
started
to
his
feet
some
vague
instinct
told
him
to
be
gone
from
this
place
the
lady
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
put
her
hand
to
a
gold
chain
that
was
round
her
neck
and
drew
out
of
her
white
bosom
not
a
locket
nor
a
key
but
an
ivory
whistle
keeping
her
eye
steadily
fixed
on
alfred
she
breathed
softly
into
the
whistle
then
two
men
stepped
quietly
in
at
the
door
one
was
a
short
stout
snob
with
great
red
whiskers
the
other
a
wiry
gentleman
with
hair
the
latter
spoke
to
alfred
and
began
to
coax
him
if
archbold
was
honey
this
personage
was
treacle
be
calm
my
dear
young
gentleman
do
agitate
yourself
you
have
been
sent
here
for
your
good
and
that
you
may
be
cured
and
so
restored
to
society
and
to
your
anxious
and
affectionate
what
are
you
talking
about
what
do
you
mean
cried
alfred
are
you
mad
no
are
not
said
the
short
snob
with
a
coarse
laugh
have
done
with
this
fooling
then
said
alfred
sharply
the
person
i
came
to
see
is
not
here
good
the
short
man
instantly
stepped
to
the
door
and
put
his
back
to
it
the
other
said
calmly
no
hardie
you
can
not
leave
the
house
at
ca
i
why
not
pray
said
alfred
drawing
his
breath
hard
and
his
eyes
began
to
glitter
dangerously
we
are
responsible
for
your
safety
we
have
force
at
hand
if
necessary
pray
do
not
compel
us
to
summon
why
where
am
i
said
alfred
panting
now
is
this
a
prison
no
no
said
archbold
soothingly
it
is
a
place
where
you
will
be
cured
of
your
headaches
and
your
delusions
and
subjected
to
no
unnecessary
pain
nor
oh
bother
said
the
short
snob
brutally
why
make
two
bites
of
a
cherry
you
are
in
my
asylum
young
gentleman
and
a
devilish
lucky
thing
for
at
this
fatal
word
asylum
alfred
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
and
despair
and
his
eyes
roved
wildly
round
the
room
in
search
of
escape
but
the
windows
of
the
room
though
outside
the
house
they
seemed
to
come
as
low
as
those
of
the
were
partly
within
and
made
just
too
high
to
be
reached
without
a
chair
and
his
captors
read
that
wild
glance
directly
and
the
doctor
whipped
one
chair
away
while
archbold
with
more
tact
sat
quietly
down
on
the
other
they
all
three
blew
their
whistles
shrilly
alfred
uttered
an
oath
and
rushed
at
the
door
but
heard
heavy
feet
running
on
stone
passages
towards
the
whistles
and
felt
he
had
no
chance
out
that
way
his
dilating
eye
fell
upon
the
handle
of
the
old
defunct
door
he
made
a
high
leap
came
down
with
his
left
foot
on
its
knob
of
brass
and
though
of
course
he
could
not
stand
on
it
contrived
to
spring
from
it
slap
at
the
window
archbold
screamed
he
broke
the
glass
with
his
shoulder
and
tore
and
kicked
the
woodwork
and
squeezed
through
on
to
a
stone
ledge
outside
and
stood
there
bleeding
and
panting
just
as
half
a
dozen
keepers
burst
into
the
room
at
his
back
he
was
more
than
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
to
leap
down
was
death
or
mutilation
he
saw
the
flyman
driving
away
he
yelled
to
him
hy
hy
stop
stop
the
flyman
stopped
and
looked
round
but
soon
as
he
saw
who
it
was
he
just
grinned
alfred
could
see
his
hideous
grin
and
there
was
the
rattle
of
chairs
being
brought
to
the
window
and
men
were
mounting
softly
to
secure
him
a
coarse
hand
stole
towards
his
ankle
he
took
a
swift
step
and
sprang
desperately
on
to
the
next
ledge
it
was
an
old
manor
house
and
these
ledges
were
nearly
a
foot
broad
from
this
one
he
bounded
to
the
next
and
then
to
a
third
the
last
but
one
on
this
side
of
the
building
the
corner
ledge
was
but
half
the
size
and
offered
no
safe
footing
but
close
to
it
he
saw
the
outside
leaves
of
a
tree
that
tree
then
must
grow
close
to
the
corner
could
he
but
get
round
to
it
he
might
yet
reach
the
ground
whole
urged
by
that
terror
of
a
madhouse
which
is
natural
to
a
sane
man
and
in
england
is
fed
by
occasional
disclosures
and
the
general
suspicion
they
excite
he
leaped
on
to
a
piece
of
stone
no
bigger
than
one
hat
and
then
whirled
himself
round
into
the
tree
all
eyes
to
see
and
claws
to
grasp
it
was
a
weeping
ash
he
could
get
hold
of
nothing
but
soft
yielding
slivers
that
went
through
his
fingers
and
so
down
with
him
like
a
bulrush
and
souse
he
went
with
his
hands
full
of
green
leaves
over
head
and
ears
into
the
water
of
an
enormous
iron
tank
that
fed
the
baths
the
heavy
plunge
the
sudden
cold
water
the
instant
darkness
were
appalling
yet
like
the
fox
among
the
hounds
the
gallant
young
gentleman
did
not
lose
heart
nor
give
tongue
he
came
up
gurgling
and
gasping
and
swimming
for
his
life
in
manly
silence
he
swam
round
and
round
the
edge
of
the
huge
tank
trying
in
vain
to
get
a
hold
upon
its
cold
rusty
walls
he
heard
whistles
and
voices
about
they
came
faint
to
him
where
he
was
but
he
knew
they
could
not
be
very
far
off
life
is
sweet
it
flashed
across
him
how
a
few
years
before
a
university
man
of
great
promise
had
perished
miserably
in
a
tank
on
some
swiss
mountain
a
tank
placed
for
the
comfort
of
travellers
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
heaven
in
despair
and
gave
one
great
sob
then
he
turned
upon
his
back
and
floated
but
he
was
obliged
to
paddle
with
his
hands
a
little
to
keep
up
a
window
opened
a
few
feet
above
him
and
a
face
peered
out
between
the
bars
then
he
gave
all
up
for
lost
and
looked
to
hear
a
voice
denounce
him
but
no
the
livid
face
and
staring
eyes
at
the
window
took
no
notice
of
him
it
was
a
maniac
whose
eyes
bereft
of
reason
conveyed
no
images
to
the
sentient
brain
only
by
some
half
vegetable
instinct
this
darkened
man
was
turning
towards
the
morning
sun
and
staring
it
full
in
the
face
alfred
saw
the
rays
strike
and
sparkle
on
those
glassy
orbs
and
fire
them
yet
they
never
so
much
as
winked
he
was
appalled
yet
fascinated
by
this
weird
sight
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
it
and
shuddered
at
it
in
the
very
water
with
such
creatures
as
that
he
must
be
confined
or
die
miserably
like
a
mouse
in
a
basin
of
water
he
hesitated
between
two
horrors
presently
his
foot
struck
something
and
he
found
it
was
a
large
pipe
that
entered
the
tank
to
the
distance
of
about
a
foot
this
pipe
was
not
more
than
three
feet
under
water
and
alfred
soon
contrived
to
get
upon
it
and
rest
his
fingers
upon
the
iron
edge
of
the
tank
the
position
was
painful
yet
so
he
determined
to
remain
till
night
and
then
if
possible
steal
away
every
faculty
of
mind
and
body
was
strung
up
to
defend
himself
against
the
wretches
who
had
entrapped
him
he
had
not
been
long
in
this
position
when
voices
approached
and
next
the
shadow
of
a
ladder
moved
across
the
wall
towards
him
the
keepers
were
going
to
search
his
pitiable
they
knew
what
he
did
not
that
there
was
no
outlet
from
the
premises
so
now
having
hunted
every
other
corner
and
cranny
they
came
by
what
is
called
the
exhaustive
process
of
reasoning
to
this
tank
and
when
they
got
near
it
something
in
the
appearance
of
the
tree
caught
the
gardener
quick
eye
alfred
quaking
heard
him
say
look
here
he
is
not
far
from
another
voice
said
then
the
lord
have
mercy
on
him
why
there
seven
foot
of
water
i
measured
it
last
at
this
alfred
was
conscious
of
a
movement
and
a
murmur
that
proved
humanity
was
not
extinct
and
the
ladder
was
fixed
close
to
the
tank
and
feet
came
hastily
up
it
alfred
despaired
but
as
usual
with
spirits
so
quickwitted
and
resolute
it
was
but
for
a
moment
one
man
in
his
time
plays
many
animals
he
caught
at
the
words
he
had
heard
and
played
the
game
the
jackal
desperate
plays
in
india
the
fox
in
england
the
elephant
in
ceylon
he
feigned
death
filled
his
mouth
with
water
floated
on
his
back
paddling
imperceptibly
and
half
closed
his
eyes
he
was
rewarded
by
a
loud
shout
of
dismay
just
above
his
head
and
very
soon
another
ladder
was
placed
on
the
other
side
and
with
ropes
and
hands
he
was
drawn
out
and
carried
down
the
ladder
he
took
this
opportunity
to
discharge
the
water
from
his
mouth
on
which
a
coarse
voice
said
look
there
troubles
are
at
an
however
they
laid
him
on
the
grass
and
sent
for
the
doctor
then
took
off
his
coat
and
one
of
them
began
to
feel
his
heart
to
see
whether
there
was
any
pulsation
left
he
found
it
thumping
look
out
he
cried
in
some
alarm
he
shamming
but
before
the
words
were
well
uttered
alfred
who
was
a
practised
gymnast
bounded
off
the
ground
without
touching
it
with
his
hands
and
fled
like
a
deer
towards
the
front
of
the
house
for
he
remembered
the
open
iron
gate
the
attendants
followed
shouting
and
whistle
answered
whistle
all
over
the
grounds
alfred
got
safe
to
the
iron
gate
alas
it
had
been
closed
at
the
first
whistle
twenty
minutes
ago
he
turned
in
rage
and
desperation
and
the
a
powerful
man
was
rushing
incautiously
upon
him
alfred
instantly
steadied
himself
and
with
his
long
arm
caught
the
man
in
full
career
a
blow
like
the
kick
of
a
pony
that
laid
his
cheek
open
and
knocked
him
stupid
and
staggering
he
followed
it
up
like
lightning
with
his
right
and
throwing
his
whole
weight
into
this
second
blow
sent
the
staggering
man
to
grass
slipped
past
another
and
skirting
the
south
side
of
the
house
got
to
the
tank
again
well
in
advance
of
his
pursuers
seized
the
ladder
carried
it
to
the
garden
wall
and
was
actually
half
way
up
it
and
saw
the
open
country
and
liberty
when
the
ladder
was
dragged
away
and
he
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
and
a
keeper
threw
himself
bodily
on
him
alfred
half
expected
this
and
drawing
up
his
foot
in
time
dashed
it
furiously
in
the
coming
face
actually
knocking
the
man
backwards
another
kneeled
on
his
chest
alfred
caught
him
by
the
throat
so
felly
that
he
lost
all
power
and
they
rolled
over
and
over
together
and
alfred
got
clear
and
ran
for
it
again
and
got
on
the
middle
of
the
lawn
and
hallooed
to
the
house
hy
hy
are
there
any
more
sane
men
imprisoned
there
come
out
and
fight
for
your
lives
instantly
the
open
windows
were
filled
with
white
faces
some
grinning
some
exulting
all
greatly
excited
and
a
hideous
uproar
shook
the
whole
place
for
the
poor
souls
were
all
sane
in
their
own
opinion
and
the
whole
force
of
attendants
two
of
them
bleeding
profusely
from
his
blows
made
a
cordon
and
approached
him
but
he
was
too
cunning
to
wait
to
be
fairly
surrounded
he
made
his
rush
at
an
feinted
at
his
head
caught
him
a
heavy
blow
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
doubled
him
up
in
a
moment
and
off
again
leaving
the
man
on
his
knees
vomiting
and
groaning
several
mild
maniacs
ran
out
in
vast
agitation
and
to
curry
favour
offered
to
help
catch
him
vast
was
their
zeal
but
when
it
came
to
the
point
they
only
danced
wildly
about
and
cried
stop
him
for
god
sake
stop
him
he
ill
dreadfully
ill
poor
wretch
knock
out
his
brains
and
whenever
he
came
near
them
away
they
ran
whining
like
kicked
curs
archbold
looking
out
at
a
window
advised
them
all
to
let
him
alone
and
she
would
come
out
and
persuade
him
but
they
would
not
be
advised
they
chased
him
about
the
lawn
but
so
swift
of
foot
was
he
and
so
long
in
the
reach
that
no
one
of
them
could
stop
him
nor
indeed
come
near
him
without
getting
a
facer
that
came
like
a
flash
of
lightning
at
last
however
they
got
so
well
round
him
he
saw
his
chance
was
gone
he
took
off
his
hat
to
archbold
at
the
window
and
said
quietly
i
surrender
to
at
these
words
they
rushed
on
him
rashly
on
this
he
planted
two
blows
right
and
left
swift
as
a
cat
attacked
by
dogs
administered
two
fearful
black
eyes
and
instantly
folded
his
arms
saying
haughtily
it
was
to
the
lady
i
yielded
not
to
you
they
seized
him
shook
their
fists
in
his
face
cursed
him
and
pinned
him
he
was
quite
passive
they
handcuffed
him
and
drove
him
before
them
shoving
him
every
now
and
then
roughly
by
the
shoulders
he
made
no
resistance
spoke
no
word
they
took
him
to
the
and
manacled
his
ankles
together
with
an
iron
hobble
and
then
strapped
them
to
the
and
fastened
his
body
down
by
broad
bands
of
ticking
with
leathern
straps
at
the
ends
and
so
left
him
more
helpless
than
a
swaddled
infant
the
hurry
and
excitement
of
defence
were
over
and
a
cold
stupor
of
misery
came
down
and
sat
like
lead
on
him
he
lay
mute
as
death
in
his
gloomy
cell
a
tomb
within
a
living
tomb
and
as
he
lay
deeper
horror
grew
and
grew
in
his
dilating
eyes
gusts
of
rage
swept
over
him
shook
him
and
passed
then
gusts
of
despairing
tenderness
all
came
and
went
but
his
bonds
what
would
his
julia
think
if
he
could
only
let
her
know
at
this
thought
he
called
he
shouted
he
begged
for
a
messenger
there
was
no
reply
the
cry
of
a
dangerous
lunatic
from
the
was
less
heeded
here
than
a
bark
from
any
in
christendom
this
is
my
father
doing
he
said
curse
him
curse
him
curse
him
and
his
brain
seemed
on
fire
his
temples
throbbed
he
vowed
to
god
to
be
revenged
on
his
father
then
he
writhed
at
his
own
meanness
in
coming
to
visit
a
servant
and
his
folly
in
being
caught
by
so
shallow
an
artifice
he
groaned
aloud
the
clock
in
the
hall
struck
ten
there
was
just
time
to
get
back
if
they
would
lend
him
a
conveyance
he
shouted
he
screamed
he
prayed
he
offered
terms
humbly
piteously
he
would
forgive
his
father
forgive
them
all
he
would
say
no
more
about
the
money
would
do
anything
consent
to
anything
if
they
would
only
let
him
keep
faith
with
his
julia
they
had
better
consent
and
not
provoke
his
vengeance
have
mercy
on
me
he
cried
do
make
me
insult
her
i
love
they
will
all
be
waiting
for
me
it
is
my
you
ca
have
known

i
tell
you
it
is

to

she
ca
be
all
stone
and
my
misery

melt
a
he
listened
for
an
answer
he
prayed
for
an
answer
there
was
none
once
in
a
the
sanest
man
is
mad
however
interested
and
barefaced
the
motive
of
the
relative
who
has
brought
two
of
the
most
venal
class
upon
the
earth
to
sign
away
his
wits
behind
his
back
and
once
hobbled
and
strapped
he
is
a
maniac
for
just
so
many
days
weeks
or
years
as
the
hobbles
handcuffs
and
jacket
happen
to
be
left
upon
him
by
inhumanity
economy
or
simple
carelessness
poor
alfred
cries
and
prayers
were
heard
but
no
more
noticed
than
the
night
howl
of
a
wolf
on
some
distant
mountain
all
was
sullen
silence
but
the
grating
tongue
of
the
clock
which
told
the
victim
of
a
legislature
shallowness
and
a
father
avarice
that
time
deaf
to
his
woe
as
were
the
walls
the
men
the
women
and
the
cutting
bands
was
stealing
away
with
iron
finger
his
last
chance
of
meeting
his
beloved
at
the
altar
he
closed
his
eyes
and
saw
her
lovelier
than
ever
dressed
all
in
white
waiting
for
him
with
sweet
concern
in
that
peerless
face
julia
julia
he
cried
with
a
loud
cry
the
struck
at
that
he
struggled
he
writhed
he
bounded
he
made
the
very
room
shake
and
lacerated
his
flesh
but
that
was
all
no
answer
no
motion
no
help
no
hope
the
perspiration
rolled
down
his
steaming
body
the
tears
burst
from
his
young
eyes
and
ran
down
his
cheeks
he
sobbed
and
sobbing
almost
choked
so
tight
were
his
linen
bands
upon
his
bursting
bosom
he
lay
still
exhausted
the
clock
ticked
harshly
on
the
rest
was
silence
with
this
miserable
exception
ever
and
anon
the
victim
jammed
body
shuddered
so
terribly
it
shook
and
rattled
the
iron
bedstead
and
told
of
the
storm
within
the
agony
of
the
racked
and
all
foreboding
soul
for
then
rolled
over
that
young
head
hours
of
mortal
anguish
that
no
tongue
of
man
can
utter
nor
pen
can
shadow
chained
sane
amongst
the
mad
on
his
expecting
with
tied
hands
the
sinister
acts
of
the
who
had
the
power
to
make
their
lie
a
truth
we
can
paint
the
body
writhing
vainly
against
its
unjust
bonds
but
who
can
paint
the
loathing
agonised
soul
in
a
mental
situation
so
ghastly
for
my
part
i
feel
it
in
my
heart
of
hearts
but
am
impotent
to
convey
it
to
others
impotent
impotent
pray
think
of
it
for
yourselves
men
and

if
you

chapter
xxxii
at
two
an
attendant
stole
on
tiptoe
to
the
unlocked
the
door
and
peeped
cautiously
in
seeing
the
dangerous
maniac
quiet
he
entered
with
a
plate
of
lukewarm
beef
and
potatoes
and
told
him
bluntly
to
eat
the
crushed
one
said
he
could
not
eat
you
must
said
the
man
eat
said
alfred
of
what
do

am
made

it
down
and
listen
to
me
i
give
you
a
hundred
pounds
to
let
me
out
of
this
place
two
hundred
a
coarse
laugh
greeted
this
proposal
you
might
as
well
have
made
it
a
thousand
when
you
was
about
so
i
will
said
alfred
eagerly
and
thank
you
on
my
knees
besides
ah
i
see
you
do
believe
i
have
money
i
give
you
my
honour
i

ten
thousand
pounds
it
was
settled
on
me
by
my
grandfather
and
i
came
of
age
last
oh

enough
said
the
man
carelessly
well

green
do
you
think
them
as
sent
you
here

let
you
spend
your
money
no
your
money
is
theirs
and
he
sat
down
with
the
plate
on
his
knee
and
began
to
cut
the
meat
in
small
pieces
while
his
careless
words
entered
alfred
heart
and
gave
him
such
a
glimpse
of
sinister
motives
and
dark
acts
to
come
as
set
him
shuddering
come
none
o
that
said
the
man
suspecting
this
shudder
he
thought
it
was
the
prologue
to
some
desperate
act
for
all
a
chained
madman
does
is
read
upon
this
plan
his
terror
passes
for
rage
his
very
sobs
for
snarls
oh
be
honest
with
me
said
alfred
imploringly
do
you
think
it
is
to
steal
my
money
the
wretch
has
stolen
my
liberty
what
wretch
my
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
the
man
sullenly
in
course
mostly
money
behind
when
young
gents
like
you
come
to
be
took
care
of
but
you
mus
go
thinking
of
that
or
you
excite
yourself
again
come
you
eat
your
vittles
like
a
christian
and
no
more
about
leave
it
that
is
a
good
fellow
and
then
i
try
and
eat
a
little
but
my
grief
is
great
oh
julia
julia
what
shall
i
do
and
i
am
not
used
to
eat
at
this
time
will
you
my
good
fellow
well
i
will
now
you
behave
like
a
gentleman
said
the
man
then
alfred
coaxed
him
to
take
off
the
handcuffs
he
refused
but
ended
by
doing
it
and
so
left
him
four
more
leaden
hours
rolled
by
and
then
this
same
attendant
his
name
was
brown
brought
him
a
cup
of
tea
it
was
welcome
to
his
parched
throat
he
drank
it
and
ate
a
mouthful
of
the
meat
to
please
the
man
and
even
asked
for
some
more
tea
at
eight
four
keepers
came
into
his
room
undressed
him
compelled
him
to
make
his
toilette
before
them
which
put
him
to
shame
being
a
gentleman
almost
as
much
as
it
would
a
woman
they
then
hobbled
him
and
fastened
his
ankles
to
the
bed
and
put
his
hands
into
muffles
but
did
not
confine
his
body
because
they
had
lost
a
lucrative
lodger
only
a
month
ago
throttled
at
night
in
a
alfred
lay
in
this
plight
and
compared
with
anguish
unspeakable
his
joyful
anticipations
of
this
night
with
the
strange
and
cruel
reality
my
wedding
night
my
wedding
night
he
cried
aloud
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
grief
he
consoled
himself
a
little
with
the
hope
that
he
could
not
long
be
incarcerated
as
a
madman
being
sane
and
his
good
wit
told
him
his
only
chance
was
calmness
he
would
go
to
sleep
and
recover
composure
to
bear
his
wrongs
with
dignity
and
quietly
baffle
his
enemies
just
as
he
was
dropping
off
he
felt
something
crawl
over
his
face
instinctively
he
made
a
violent
motion
to
put
his
hands
up
both
hands
were
confined
he
could
not
move
them
he
bounded
he
flung
he
writhed
his
little
persecutors
were
quiet
a
moment
but
the
next
they
began
again
in
vain
he
rolled
and
writhed
and
shuddered
with
loathing
inexpressible
they
crawled
they
smelt
they
bit
many
a
poor
soul
these
little
wretches
had
distracted
with
the
very
sleeplessness
the
madhouse
professed
to
cure
not
create
in
conjunction
with
the
opiates
the
confinement
and
the
gloom
of
silverton
house
they
had
driven
many
a
feeble
mind
across
the
line
that
divides
the
weak
and
nervous
from
the
unsound
when
he
found
there
was
no
help
alfred
clenched
his
teeth
and
bore
it
bite
on
ye
little
wretches
he
said
bite
on
and
divert
my
mind
from
deeper
stings
than
yours
if
you
and
they
did
a
little
thus
passed
the
night
in
mental
agony
and
bodily
irritation
and
disgust
at
daybreak
the
feasters
on
his
flesh
retired
and
utterly
worn
out
and
exhausted
he
sank
into
a
deep
sleep
at
seven
the
head
keeper
and
three
more
came
in
and
made
him
dress
before
them
they
handcuffed
him
and
took
him
down
to
breakfast
in
the
noisy
ward
set
him
down
on
a
little
bench
by
the
wall
like
a
naughty
boy
and
ordered
a
dangerous
maniac
to
feed
him
the
dangerous
maniac
obeyed
and
went
and
sat
beside
alfred
with
a
basin
of
thick
gruel
and
a
great
wooden
spoon
he
shovelled
the
gruel
down
his
charge
throat
mighty
superciliously
from
the
very
first
and
presently
falling
into
some
favourite
and
absorbing
train
of
thought
he
fixed
his
eye
on
vacancy
and
handed
the
spoonfuls
over
his
left
shoulder
with
such
rapidity
and
recklessness
that
it
was
more
like
sowing
than
feeding
alfred
cried
out
quarter
i
ca
eat
so
fast
as
that
old
something
in
his
tone
struck
the
maniac
he
looked
at
alfred
full
alfred
looked
at
him
in
return
and
smiled
kindly
but
sadly
hallo
cried
the
maniac
what
up
now
said
a
keeper
fiercely
why
this
man
is
sane
as
sane
as
i
at
this
there
was
a
horse
laugh
saner
persisted
the
maniac
for
i
am
a
little
queer
at
times
you
and
no
mistake
jemmy
now
what
makes
you
think
he
is
sane
looked
me
full
in
the
face
and
smiled
at
oh
that
is
your
test
is
it
yes
it
is
you
try
it
on
any
of
those
mad
beggars
there
and
see
if
they
can
stand
who
invented
gunpowder
said
one
of
the
insulted
persons
looking
as
sly
and
malicious
as
a
magpie
going
to
steal
jemmy
exploded
directly
i
did
ye
rascal
ye
liar
ye
rogue
ye
baconian
and
going
higher
and
higher
in
this
strain
was
very
soon
handcuffed
with
alfred
handcuffs
and
seated
on
alfred
bench
and
tied
to
two
rings
in
the
wall
on
this
his
martial
ardour
went
down
to
zero
here
is
treatment
sir
said
he
piteously
to
alfred
i
see
you
are
a
gentleman
now
look
at
this
all
spite
and
jealousy
because
i
invented
that
invaluable
substance
which
has
done
so
much
to
prolong
human
life
and
alleviate
human
alfred
was
now
ordered
to
feed
jemmy
which
he
did
so
quickly
were
their
parts
inverted
directly
after
breakfast
alfred
demanded
to
see
the
proprietor
of
the
asylum
answer
does
live
here
the
doctor
then
oh
he
has
not
come
this
monstrosity
irritated
alfred
well
then
said
he
whoever
it
is
that
rules
this
den
of
thieves
when
those
two
are
out
of
i
rule
in
baker
absence
said
the
head
keeper
and
i
teach
you
manners
you
young
blackguard
handcuff
in
five
minutes
alfred
was
handcuffed
and
flung
into
a
padded
room
stay
there
till
you
know
how
to
speak
to
your
betters
said
the
head
keeper
alfred
walked
up
and
down
grinding
his
teeth
with
rage
for
five
long
hours
just
before
dinner
brown
came
and
took
him
into
a
parlour
where
archbold
was
seated
writing
brown
retired
the
lady
finished
what
she
was
doing
and
kept
alfred
standing
like
a
schoolboy
going
to
be
lectured
at
last
she
said
i
have
sent
for
you
to
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
it
is
to
try
and
make
friends
with
the
me
make
friends
with
the
scoundrels
i
thirst
for
their
lives
oh
madam
i
fear
i
shall
kill
somebody
foolish
boy
they
are
too
strong
for
you
your
worst
enemies
could
wish
nothing
worse
for
you
than
that
you
should
provoke
in
saying
these
words
she
was
so
much
more
kind
and
womanly
that
alfred
conceived
hopes
and
burst
out
oh
madam
you
are
human
then
you
seem
to
pity
me
pray
give
me
pen
and
paper
and
let
me
write
to
my
friends
to
get
me
out
of
this
terrible
place
do
not
refuse
archbold
resumed
her
distant
manner
without
apparent
effort
she
said
nothing
but
she
placed
writing
materials
before
him
she
then
left
the
room
and
locked
him
in
he
wrote
a
few
hasty
ardent
words
to
julia
telling
her
how
he
had
been
entrapped
but
not
a
word
about
his
sufferings
he
was
too
generous
to
give
her
needless
pain
and
a
line
to
edward
imploring
him
to
come
at
once
with
a
lawyer
and
an
honest
physician
and
liberate
him
archbold
returned
soon
after
and
he
asked
her
if
she
would
lend
him
i
dare
not
trust
to
an
envelope
in
such
a
place
as
this
said
he
she
lent
him
but
how
am
i
to
post
it
said
he
easily
there
is
a
box
in
the
house
i
will
show
she
took
him
and
showed
him
the
box
he
put
his
letters
into
it
and
in
the
ardour
of
his
gratitude
kissed
her
hand
she
winced
a
little
and
said
mind
this
is
not
by
my
advice
i
would
never
tell
my
friends
i
had
been
in
a
madhouse
oh
never
i
would
be
calm
make
friends
with
the
servants
they
are
the
real
masters
and
never
let
a
creature
know
where
i
had
oh
you
do
know
my
julia
said
alfred
she
will
never
desert
me
never
think
the
worse
of
me
because
i
have
been
entrapped
illegally
into
a
illegally
hardie
you
deceive
yourself
baker
told
me
the
order
was
signed
by
a
relation
and
the
certificates
by
lunacy
what
on
earth
has
that
to
do
with
it
madam
when
i
am
as
sane
as
you
are
it
has
everything
to
do
with
it
baker
could
be
punished
for
confining
a
madman
in
this
house
without
an
order
and
two
certificates
but
he
could
for
confining
a
sane
person
under
an
order
and
two
alfred
could
not
believe
this
but
she
convinced
him
that
it
was
so
then
he
began
to
fear
he
should
be
imprisoned
for
years
he
turned
pale
and
looked
at
her
so
piteously
that
to
soothe
him
she
told
him
sane
people
were
never
kept
in
asylums
now
they
only
used
to
be
how
can
they
said
she
the
london
asylums
are
visited
four
times
a
year
by
the
commissioners
and
the
country
asylums
six
times
twice
by
the
commissioners
and
four
times
by
the
justices
shall
be
inspected
this
week
or
next
and
then
you
can
speak
to
the
justices
mind
and
be
calm
say
it
is
a
mistake
offer
testimony
and
ask
either
to
be
discharged
at
once
or
to
have
a
commission
of
lunacy
sit
on
you
ten
to
one
your
friends
will
not
face
public
proceedings
but
you
must
begin
at
the
foundation
by
making
the
servants
friendly
and
by
being
she
then
fixed
her
large
grey
eyes
on
him
and
said
now
if
i
let
you
dine
with
me
and
the
patients
will
you
pledge
me
your
honour
to
calm
and
not
attempt
to
escape
alfred
hesitated
at
that
her
eye
dissected
his
character
all
the
time
i
promise
said
he
at
last
with
a
deep
sigh
may
i
sit
by
you
there
is
something
so
repugnant
in
the
very
idea
of
mad
try
and
remember
it
is
their
misfortune
not
their
crime
said
archbold
just
like
a
matronly
sister
admonishing
a
brother
from
school
she
then
whistled
in
a
whisper
for
brown
who
was
lurking
about
unseen
all
the
time
he
emerged
and
walked
about
with
alfred
and
looking
down
from
a
corridor
they
saw
archbold
driving
the
women
before
her
to
dinner
like
a
flock
of
animals
whenever
one
stopped
to
look
at
anything
or
try
and
gossip
the
philanthropic
archbold
went
at
her
just
like
a
shepherd
dog
at
a
refractory
sheep
caught
her
by
the
shoulders
and
drove
her
squeaking
headlong
at
dinner
alfred
was
so
fortunate
as
to
sit
opposite
a
gentleman
who
nodded
and
grinned
at
him
all
dinner
with
a
horrible
leer
he
could
not
however
enjoy
this
to
the
full
for
a
little
distraction
at
his
elbow
his
right
hand
neighbour
kept
forking
pieces
out
of
his
plate
and
substituting
others
from
his
own
there
was
even
a
tendency
to
gristle
in
the
latter
alfred
remonstrated
gently
at
first
the
gentleman
forbore
a
minute
then
recommenced
alfred
laid
a
hand
very
quietly
on
his
wrist
and
put
it
back
archbold
quick
eye
surprised
this
gesture
what
is
the
matter
there
said
she
oh
nothing
serious
madam
replied
alfred
only
this
gentleman
does
me
the
honour
to
prefer
the
contents
of
my
plate
to
his
mr
cooper
said
the
archbold
sternly
cooper
the
head
keeper
pounced
on
the
offender
seized
him
roughly
by
the
collar
dragged
him
from
the
table
knocking
his
chair
down
and
bundled
him
out
of
the
room
with
ignominy
and
fracas
in
spite
of
a
remonstrance
from
alfred
oh
do
be
so
rough
with
the
poor
then
the
novice
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
ate
no
more
i
am
grieved
at
my
own
in
complaining
of
such
a
trifle
said
he
when
all
was
quiet
the
company
stared
considerably
at
this
remark
it
seemed
to
them
a
most
morbid
perversion
of
sensibility
for
the
deranged
beyond
conception
in
their
own
persons
and
alive
to
the
shadow
of
the
shade
of
a
wrong
are
stoically
indifferent
to
the
woes
of
others
though
alfred
was
quiet
as
a
lamb
all
day
the
attendants
returned
him
to
the
padded
room
at
night
because
he
had
been
there
last
night
but
they
only
fastened
one
ankle
to
the
so
he
encountered
his
lilliputians
on
tolerably
fair
terms
numbers
excepted
they
swarmed
unable
to
sleep
he
put
out
his
hand
and
groped
for
his
clothes
but
they
were
outside
the
door
according
to
rule
day
broke
at
last
and
he
took
his
breakfast
quietly
with
the
patients
it
consisted
of
cool
tea
in
small
basins
instead
of
cups
and
instead
of
and
thick
slices
of
stale
bread
thinly
buttered
a
few
patients
had
gruel
or
porridge
instead
of
tea
after
breakfast
alfred
sat
in
the
room
and
counted
the
minutes
and
the
hours
till
edward
should
come
after
dinner
he
counted
the
hours
till
nobody
came
and
he
went
to
bed
in
such
grief
and
disappointment
as
some
men
live
to
eighty
without
ever
knowing
but
when
two
came
next
day
and
no
edward
and
no
reply
then
the
distress
of
his
soul
deepened
he
implored
archbold
to
tell
him
what
was
the
cause
she
shook
her
head
and
said
gravely
it
was
but
too
common
a
man
nearest
and
dearest
were
very
apt
to
hold
aloof
from
him
the
moment
he
was
put
into
an
asylum
here
an
old
lady
put
in
her
word
ah
sir
you
must
not
hope
to
hear
from
anybody
in
this
place
why
i
have
been
two
years
writing
and
writing
and
ca
get
a
line
from
my
own
daughter
to
be
sure
she
is
a
fine
lady
now
but
it
was
her
poor
neglected
mother
that
pinched
and
pinched
to
give
her
a
good
education
and
that
is
how
she
caught
a
good
husband
but
it
my
belief
the
post
in
our
hall
is
a
real
post
but
only
a
box
and
i
think
it
is
contrived
so
as
the
letters
fall
down
a
pipe
into
that
baker
hands
and
so
then
when
the
postman
comes
the
archbold
bent
her
bushy
brows
on
this
chatty
personage
be
quiet
dent
you
are
talking
nonsense
and
exciting
yourself
you
know
you
are
not
to
speak
on
that
topic
take
the
poor
old
woman
was
shut
up
like
a
knife
for
the
archbold
had
a
way
of
addressing
her
own
sex
that
crushed
them
the
change
was
almost
comically
sudden
to
the
mellow
tones
in
which
she
addressed
alfred
the
very
next
moment
on
the
very
same
subject
mr
baker
i
believe
sees
the
letters
and
where
our
poor
patients
with
a
glance
at
dent
write
in
such
a
way
as
to
wound
and
perhaps
terrify
those
who
are
in
reality
their
best
friends
they
are
not
always
sent
but
i
conclude
letters
have
gone
if
you
feel
you
can
be
calm
why
not
ask
baker
he
is
in
the
house
now
for
a
alfred
promised
to
be
calm
and
she
got
him
an
interview
with
baker
he
was
a
pawnbroker
of
silverton
town
whom
the
legislature
with
that
keen
knowledge
of
human
nature
which
marks
the
british
senate
permitted
and
still
permits
to
speculate
in
insanity
stipulating
however
that
the
upper
servant
of
all
in
his
asylum
should
be
a
doctor
but
omitting
to
provide
against
the
instant
dismissal
of
the
said
doctor
should
he
go
and
rob
his
employer
of
a
lodger
by
curing
a
patient
as
you
are
not
the
british
legislature
i
need
not
tell
you
that
to
this
pawnbroker
insanity
mattered
nothing
nor
sanity
his
trade
lay
in
catching
and
keeping
and
stinting
as
many
lodgers
sane
or
insane
as
he
could
hold
there
are
certain
formulae
in
these
quiet
retreats
which
naturally
impose
upon
greenhorns
such
as
alfred
certainly
was
and
some
visiting
justices
and
lunacy
commissioners
would
seem
to
be
baker
had
been
a
keeper
for
certified
people
many
years
and
knew
all
the
formulae
some
call
them
dodges
but
these
must
surely
be
vulgar
minds
baker
worked
the
letters
young
gentleman
said
he
they
are
not
in
my
department
they
go
into
the
surgery
and
are
passed
by
the
doctor
except
those
he
examines
and
orders
to
be
alfred
demanded
the
doctor
he
is
gone
was
the
reply
formula
alfred
found
it
as
hard
to
be
calm
as
some
people
find
it
easy
to
say
that
word
over
the
wrongs
the
next
day
but
not
till
the
afternoon
he
caught
the
doctor
my
letters
surely
sir
you
have
not
been
so
cruel
as
to
intercept
them
i
intercept
no
letters
said
the
doctor
as
if
scandalised
at
the
very
idea
i
see
who
writes
them
and
hand
them
to
baker
with
now
and
then
a
remark
if
any
are
detained
the
responsibility
rests
with
he
says
it
rests
with
you
must
have
misunderstood
not
at
all
sir
one
thing
is
clear
my
letters
have
been
stolen
either
by
him
or
you
and
i
will
know
the
doctor
parried
with
a
formula
you
are
hardie
be
calm
sir
be
calm
or
you
will
be
here
all
the
all
alfred
obtained
by
this
interview
was
a
powerful
opiate
the
brought
it
him
in
bed
he
declined
to
take
it
the
man
whistled
and
the
room
filled
with
keepers
now
said
cooper
down
with
it
or
you
have
to
be
drenched
with
this
you
had
better
take
it
sir
said
brown
the
doctor
has
ordered
it
the
doctor
well
let
me
see
the
doctor
about
he
is
he
never
ordered
it
me
said
alfred
then
fixing
his
eyes
sternly
on
cooper
you
miscreants
you
want
to
poison
me
no
i
will
not
take
it
murder
murder
then
ensued
a
struggle
on
which
i
draw
a
veil
but
numbers
won
the
day
with
the
help
of
handcuffs
and
a
cowhorn
brown
went
and
told
archbold
and
what
alfred
had
said
do
be
alarmed
said
that
lady
it
is
only
one
of
the
old
fool
composing
draughts
it
will
spoil
the
poor
boy
sleep
for
one
night
that
is
all
go
to
him
the
first
thing
in
the
about
midnight
alfred
was
seized
with
a
violent
headache
and
fever
towards
morning
he
was
and
brown
found
him
loud
and
incoherent
only
he
returned
often
to
an
expression
brown
had
never
heard
before
justifiable
parricide
justifiable
parricide
justifiable
most
people
dislike
new
phrases
brown
ran
to
consult
archbold
about
this
one
after
the
delay
inseparable
from
her
sex
she
came
in
a
morning
wrapper
and
they
found
alfred
leaning
over
the
bed
and
bleeding
violently
at
the
nose
they
were
a
good
deal
alarmed
and
tried
to
stop
it
but
alfred
was
quite
sensible
now
and
told
them
it
was
doing
him
good
i
can
manage
to
see
now
he
said
a
little
while
ago
i
was
blind
with
the
they
unstrapped
his
ankle
and
made
him
comfortable
and
archbold
sent
brown
for
a
cup
of
strong
coffee
and
a
glass
of
brandy
he
tossed
them
off
and
soon
after
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
that
lasted
till
this
sleep
the
poor
doctor
ascribed
to
the
sedative
effect
of
his
opiate
it
the
natural
exhaustion
consequent
on
the
morbid
excitement
caused
by
his
cursed
opiate
brown
said
archbold
if
bailey
prescribes
again
let
me
know
he
sha
square
patient
with
his
certificates
whilst
i
am
this
was
a
shrewd
but
uncharitable
speech
of
hers
bailey
was
not
such
a
villain
as
that
he
was
a
less
depraved
and
more
dangerous
animal
he
was
a
fool
the
farrago
he
had
administered
would
have
done
an
excited
maniac
no
good
of
course
but
no
great
harm
it
was
dangerous
to
a
sane
man
and
alfred
to
the
naked
eye
was
a
sane
man
but
then
bailey
had
no
naked
eye
left
he
had
been
twenty
years
an
the
certificates
of
wycherley
and
speers
were
the
green
spectacles
he
wore
very
green
ones
whenever
he
looked
at
alfred
hardie
perhaps
in
time
he
will
forget
those
certificates
and
on
his
spectacles
dropping
off
he
will
see
alfred
is
sane
if
he
does
he
will
publish
him
as
one
of
his
most
remarkable
meanwhile
the
whole
treatment
of
this
young
gentleman
gravitated
towards
insanity
the
inner
mind
was
exasperated
by
barefaced
injustice
and
oppression
above
all
by
his
letters
being
stopped
for
that
convinced
him
both
baker
and
bailey
with
their
evasions
knew
he
was
sane
and
dreaded
a
visit
from
honest
understanding
men
and
the
mind
external
organ
the
brain
which
an
asylum
professes
to
soothe
was
steadily
undermined
by
artificial
sleeplessness
a
man
sleep
in
irons
till
he
is
used
to
them
and
when
alfred
was
relieved
of
these
his
sleep
was
still
driven
away
by
biting
insects
and
barking
dogs
two
opiates
provided
in
many
of
these
placid
retreats
with
a
view
to
the
permanence
rather
than
the
comfort
of
the
lodgers
on
the
eighth
day
alfred
succeeded
at
last
in
an
object
he
had
steadily
pursued
for
some
time
he
caught
the
two
humbugs
together
now
said
he
say
intercepts
my
letters
and
says
it
is
who
do
it
which
is
the
truth
they
were
staggered
and
he
followed
up
his
advantage
look
me
in
the
face
gentlemen
said
he
can
you
pretend
you
do
not
know
i
am
sane
ah
you
turn
your
heads
away
you
can
only
tell
this
lie
behind
my
back
do
you
believe
in
god
and
in
a
judgment
to
come
then
if
you
can
not
release
me
at
least
do
be
such
scoundrels
as
to
stop
my
letters
and
so
swindle
me
out
of
a
fair
trial
an
open
public
the
doctor
parried
with
a
formula
publicity
would
be
the
greatest
misfortune
could
befall
you
pray
be
now
an
asylum
is
a
place
not
entirely
exempt
from
prejudices
and
one
of
them
is
that
any
sort
of
appeal
to
god
almighty
is
a
sign
or
else
forerunner
of
maniacal
excitement
these
philosophers
forget
that
by
stopping
letters
evading
public
trials
and
in
a
word
cutting
off
all
appeals
to
human
justice
they
compel
the
patient
to
turn
his
despairing
eyes
and
lift
his
despairing
voice
to
him
whose
eye
alone
can
ever
really
penetrate
these
dark
abodes
however
the
patient
who
appealed
to
god
above
a
whisper
in
silverton
grove
house
used
to
get
soothed
directly
and
the
tranquillising
influences
employed
were
morphia
croton
oil
or
a
blister
the
keeper
came
to
alfred
in
his
room
doctor
has
ordered
a
what
for
send
for
him
he
is
this
way
of
ordering
torture
and
then
coolly
going
irritated
alfred
beyond
endurance
though
he
knew
he
should
soon
be
powerless
he
showed
fight
made
his
mark
as
usual
on
a
couple
of
his
zealous
attendants
but
not
having
room
to
work
in
was
soon
overpowered
hobbled
and
handcuffed
then
they
cut
off
his
hair
and
put
a
large
blister
on
the
top
of
his
head
the
obstinate
brute
declined
to
go
mad
they
began
to
respect
him
for
this
tenacity
of
purpose
a
decent
bedroom
was
allotted
him
his
portmanteau
and
bag
were
brought
him
and
he
was
let
walk
every
day
on
the
lawn
with
a
keeper
only
there
were
no
ladders
left
about
and
the
was
locked
the
iron
gate
on
one
of
these
occasions
he
heard
the
gatekeeper
whistle
three
times
consecutively
his
attendant
followed
suit
and
hurried
alfred
into
the
house
which
soon
rang
with
treble
signals
what
is
it
inquired
alfred
the
visiting
justices
are
in
sight
go
into
your
room
yes
i
go
said
alfred
affecting
cheerful
compliance
and
the
man
ran
off
the
whole
house
was
in
a
furious
bustle
all
the
hobbles
and
chains
and
instruments
of
restraint
were
hastily
collected
and
bundled
out
of
sight
and
clean
sheets
were
being
put
on
many
a
filthy
bed
whose
occupant
had
never
slept
in
sheets
since
he
came
there
when
two
justices
arrived
and
were
shown
into
the
during
the
few
minutes
they
were
detained
there
by
archbold
who
was
mistress
of
her
whole
business
quite
a
new
face
was
put
on
everything
and
everybody
ancient
cobwebs
fell
soap
and
water
explored
unwonted
territories
the
harshest
attendants
began
practising
pleasant
looks
and
kind
words
on
the
patients
to
get
into
the
way
of
it
so
that
it
might
not
come
too
abrupt
and
startle
the
patients
visibly
under
the
visitors
eyes
something
like
actors
working
up
a
factitious
sentiment
at
the
wing
for
the
public
display
or
like
a
racehorse
preliminary
canter
alfred
heart
beat
with
joy
inexpressible
he
had
only
to
keep
calm
and
this
was
his
last
day
at
silverton
grove
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
make
a
careful
toilet
the
stinginess
of
relations
and
the
greed
of
madhouse
proprietors
make
many
a
patient
look
ten
times
madder
than
he
is
by
means
of
dress
clothes
wear
out
in
an
asylum
and
are
not
always
taken
off
though
agriculture
has
long
and
justly
claimed
them
for
her
own
and
when
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
refuse
the
reverend
mad
tom
or
crazy
jane
some
new
raiment
then
consanguineous
munificence
does
not
go
to
pool
or
elise
but
oftener
to
paternal
or
maternal
wardrobes
and
even
to
the
ancestral
chest
the
old
oak
one
singing
poor
things
they
are
out
of
the
world
what
need
for
them
to
be
in
the
fashion
formula
this
arrangement
keeps
the
bump
of
down
especially
in
women
and
so
with
many
other
little
arrangements
to
perpetuate
the
lodger
silverton
grove
in
particular
was
supplied
with
the
grotesque
in
dress
from
an
inexhaustible
source
whenever
money
was
sent
baker
to
buy
a
patient
a
suit
he
went
from
his
lunacy
shop
to
his
pawnbroker
dived
headlong
into
unredeemed
pledges
dressed
his
patient
as
gentlemen
are
dressed
to
reside
in
and
pocketed
five
hundred
per
cent
on
the
double
transaction
now
alfred
had
already
observed
that
many
of
the
patients
looked
madder
than
they
were
thanks
to
short
trousers
and
petticoats
holey
gloves
frilled
bosoms
shoes
made
for
and
declined
by
the
very
infantry
coats
short
in
the
waist
and
long
in
the
sleeves
coalscuttle
bonnets
and
caps
so
he
made
his
toilet
with
care
and
put
his
best
hat
on
to
hide
his
shaven
crown
he
then
kept
his
door
ajar
and
waited
for
a
chance
of
speaking
to
the
justices
one
soon
came
a
portly
old
gentleman
with
a
rubicund
face
and
honest
eye
walked
slowly
along
the
corridor
looking
as
wise
as
he
could
cringed
on
by
cooper
and
bailey
the
latter
had
arrived
post
haste
and
baker
had
been
sent
for
alfred
came
out
touched
his
hat
respectfully
and
begged
a
private
interview
with
the
magistrate
the
old
gentleman
bowed
politely
for
alfred
dress
address
and
countenance
left
no
suspicion
of
insanity
possible
in
an
unprejudiced
mind
but
the
doctor
whispered
in
his
ear
take
care
sir
dangerous
now
this
is
one
of
the
most
effective
of
the
formulae
in
a
private
asylum
how
can
an
inexperienced
stranger
know
for
certain
that
such
a
statement
is
a
falsehood
and
even
the
just
do
not
love
justice
quite
so
well
as
they
love
their
own
skins
so
squire
tollett
very
naturally
declined
a
private
interview
with
alfred
and
even
drew
back
a
step
and
felt
uneasy
at
being
so
near
him
alfred
implored
him
not
to
be
imposed
upon
an
honest
man
does
not
whisper
said
he
do
not
let
him
poison
your
mind
against
me
on
my
honour
i
am
as
sane
as
you
are
and
he
knows
it
pray
pray
use
your
own
eyes
and
ears
sir
and
give
yourself
a
chance
of
discovering
the
truth
in
this
stronghold
of
do
excite
yourself
hardie
put
in
the
doctor
parentally
formula
do
you
interrupt
me
doctor
i
am
as
calm
as
you
are
calmer
for
see
you
are
pale
at
this
moment
that
is
with
fear
that
your
wickedness
in
detaining
a
sane
man
here
is
going
to
be
exposed
oh
sir
said
he
turning
to
the
justice
fear
no
violence
from
me
not
even
angry
words
my
misery
is
too
deep
for
irritation
or
excitement
i
am
an
oxford
man
sir
a
prize
man
an
ireland
scholar
but
unfortunately
for
me
my
mother
left
me
ten
thousand
pounds
and
a
heart
i
love
a
lady
whose
name
i
will
not
pollute
by
mentioning
it
in
this
den
of
thieves
my
father
is
the
banker
bankrupt
and
cheat
of
barkington
he
has
wasted
his
own
money
and
now
covets
his
neighbour
and
his
son
he
had
me
entrapped
here
on
my
to
get
hold
of
my
money
and
rob
me
of
her
i
love
i
appeal
to
you
sir
to
discharge
me
or
if
you
have
not
so
much
confidence
in
your
own
judgment
as
to
do
that
then
i
demand
a
commission
of
lunacy
and
a
public
bailey
said
that
would
be
a
most
undesirable
exposure
both
to
yourself
and
your
formula
it
is
only
the
guilty
who
fear
the
light
sir
was
the
prompt
reply
tollett
said
he
thought
the
patient
had
a
legal
right
to
a
commission
of
lunacy
if
there
was
property
and
he
took
note
of
the
application
he
then
asked
alfred
if
he
had
any
complaint
to
make
of
the
food
the
beds
or
the
attendants
sir
said
alfred
i
leave
those
complaints
to
the
insane
ones
with
me
the
gigantic
wrong
drives
out
the
petty
worries
i
can
not
feel
my
stings
for
my
deep
oh
then
you
admit
you
are
not
treated
here
i
admit
nothing
of
the
kind
sir
i
merely
decline
to
encumber
your
memory
with
petty
injuries
when
you
are
good
enough
to
inquire
into
a
monstrous
now
that
is
very
sensible
and
considerate
said
tollett
i
will
see
you
sir
again
before
we
with
this
promise
alfred
was
obliged
to
be
content
he
retired
respectfully
and
the
justice
said
he
seems
as
sane
as
i
the
doctor
smiled
the
justice
observed
it
and
not
aware
that
this
smile
was
a
formula
as
much
so
as
a
prizefighter
or
a
began
to
doubt
a
little
he
reflected
a
moment
then
asked
who
had
signed
the
certificates
dr
wycherley
for
dr
wycherley
that
is
a
great
one
of
the
greatest
in
the
country
oh
then
one
would
think
he
must
be
more
or
less
dangerously
so
at
times
but
in
his
lucid
intervals
you
never
saw
a
more
quiet
gentlemanly
formula
how
sad
very
he
is
my
most
interesting
patient
formula
though
terribly
violent
at
times
would
you
like
to
see
the
medical
journal
about
him
yes
the
inspection
then
continued
the
inspector
admired
the
clean
sheets
that
covered
the
beds
all
of
them
dirty
some
filthy
and
asked
the
more
reasonable
patients
to
speak
freely
and
say
if
they
had
any
complaint
to
make
this
question
being
with
the
usual
sagacity
of
public
inspectors
put
in
the
presence
of
cooper
and
the
doctor
who
stuck
to
tollett
like
wax
the
mad
people
all
declared
they
were
very
kindly
treated
the
reason
they
were
so
unanimous
was
this
they
knew
by
experience
that
if
they
told
the
truth
the
justices
could
not
at
once
remedy
their
discomforts
whereas
the
keepers
the
very
moment
the
justices
left
the
house
would
knock
them
down
beat
them
shake
them
them
and
starve
them
and
the
doctor
less
merciful
would
doctor
them
so
they
shook
in
their
shoes
and
vowed
they
were
very
comfortable
in
silverton
grove
thus
in
later
days
certain
commissioners
of
lunacy
inspecting
accomb
house
extracted
nothing
from
turner
but
that
she
was
happy
and
comfortable
under
the
benignant
sway
of
metcalf
the
mild
there
present
it
was
only
by
a
miracle
the
public
learned
the
truth
and
miracles
are
rare
meantime
alfred
had
a
misgiving
the
plausible
doctor
had
now
squire
tollett
ear
and
tollett
was
old
and
something
about
him
reminded
the
oxonian
of
a
trait
his
friend
horace
had
detected
in
old
age
vel
quod
res
omnes
timide
gelide
que
ministrat
dilator
spe
longus
iners
he
knew
there
was
another
justice
in
the
house
but
he
knew
also
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
get
speech
with
him
if
by
cunning
or
force
it
could
be
prevented
he
kept
his
door
ajar
presently
nurse
hannah
came
bustling
along
with
an
apronful
of
things
and
let
herself
into
a
vacant
room
hard
by
this
hannah
was
a
young
woman
with
a
pretty
and
rather
babyish
face
diversified
by
a
thick
biceps
muscle
in
her
arm
that
a
blacksmith
need
not
have
blushed
for
and
i
suspect
it
was
this
masculine
charm
and
not
her
feminine
features
that
had
won
her
the
confidence
of
baker
and
and
the
respect
of
his
female
patients
big
or
little
excited
or
not
excited
there
was
not
one
of
them
this
bicipital
could
not
pin
by
the
wrists
and
twist
her
helpless
into
a
or
handcuff
her
unaided
in
a
moment
and
she
did
it
too
on
slight
provocation
nurse
hannah
seldom
came
into
alfred
part
of
the
house
but
when
she
did
meet
him
she
generally
gave
him
a
kind
look
in
passing
and
he
had
resolved
to
speak
to
her
and
try
if
he
could
touch
her
conscience
or
move
her
pity
he
saw
what
she
was
at
but
was
too
politic
to
detect
her
openly
and
irritate
her
he
drew
back
a
step
and
said
softly
nurse
hannah
are
you
there
yes
i
am
here
said
she
sharply
and
came
out
of
the
room
hastily
and
shut
it
what
do
you
want
sir
alfred
clasped
his
hands
together
if
you
are
a
woman
have
pity
on
she
was
taken
by
surprise
what
can
i
do
said
she
in
some
agitation
i
am
only
a
at
least
tell
me
where
i
can
find
the
visiting
justice
before
the
keepers
stop
hush
speak
lower
said
hannah
you
complained
to
one
you
yes
but
he
seems
a
feeble
old
fogy
where
is
the
other
oh
pray
tell
me
i
must
i
must
in
the
noisy
ward
there
and
run
he
did
alfred
was
lucky
enough
to
get
safe
into
the
noisy
ward
without
being
intercepted
and
then
he
encountered
a
sunburnt
gentleman
under
thirty
in
a
with
a
in
his
hand
it
was
vane
a
tory
squire
and
large
landholder
in
the
county
now
as
alfred
entered
at
one
door
baker
himself
came
in
at
the
other
and
they
nearly
met
at
vane
but
alfred
saluted
him
first
and
begged
respectfully
for
an
interview
certainly
sir
said
vane
take
care
sir
he
is
dangerous
whispered
baker
instantly
countenance
changed
but
this
time
alfred
overheard
the
formula
and
said
quietly
do
believe
him
sir
i
am
not
dangerous
i
am
as
sane
as
any
man
in
england
pray
examine
me
and
judge
for
ah
that
is
his
delusion
said
baker
come
hardie
i
allow
you
great
liberties
but
you
abuse
them
you
really
must
not
monopolise
his
worship
with
your
fancies
consider
sir
you
are
not
the
only
patient
he
has
to
alfred
heart
sank
he
turned
a
look
of
silent
agony
on
vane
vane
either
touched
by
that
look
or
irritated
by
pragmatical
interference
or
perhaps
both
looked
that
person
coolly
in
the
face
and
said
sternly
be
silent
sir
and
let
speak
to
chapter
xxxiii
alfred
thus
encouraged
told
his
story
with
forced
calmness
and
without
a
word
too
much
indeed
so
clear
and
telling
was
the
narrative
and
the
logic
so
close
that
incoherent
patients
one
or
two
stole
up
and
listened
with
wonder
and
a
certain
dreamy
complacency
the
bulk
however
held
aloof
apathetic
inextricably
wrapped
in
fictitious
autobiography
his
story
told
alfred
offered
the
dodds
in
evidence
that
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
was
no
illusion
and
referred
to
his
sister
and
several
friends
as
witnesses
to
his
sanity
and
said
the
letters
he
wrote
were
all
stopped
in
the
asylum
and
why
that
no
honest
man
or
woman
might
know
where
he
was
he
ended
by
convincing
vane
he
was
a
sane
and
injured
man
and
his
father
a
dark
designing
person
vane
asked
him
whether
he
had
any
other
revelations
to
make
alfred
replied
not
on
my
own
account
but
for
the
sake
of
those
afflicted
persons
who
are
here
for
life
well
the
beds
want
repaving
the
vermin
thinning
the
instruments
of
torture
want
abolishing
instead
of
hiding
for
an
hour
or
two
when
you
happen
to
come
what
do
the
patients
gain
by
that
the
madmen
dare
not
complain
to
you
sir
because
the
last
time
one
did
complain
to
the
justices
it
was
petworth
they
had
no
sooner
passed
through
the
iron
gate
than
cooper
made
an
example
of
him
felled
him
with
his
fist
and
walked
up
and
down
him
on
his
knees
crying
teach
you
to
complain
to
the
justices
but
one
or
two
gentlemanly
madmen
who
soon
found
out
that
i
am
not
one
of
have
complained
to
that
the
attendants
wash
them
too
much
like
hansom
cabs
strip
them
naked
and
mop
them
on
the
then
fling
on
their
clothes
without
drying
them
they
say
too
that
the
meat
is
tough
and
often
putrid
the
bread
stale
the
butter
rancid
the
vegetables
stinted
since
they
ca
be
adulterated
and
as
for
sleep
it
is
hardly
known
for
the
beds
are
so
short
your
feet
stick
out
insects
without
a
name
to
ears
polite
but
highly
odoriferous
and
profoundly
carnivorous
bite
you
all
night
and
dogs
howl
eternally
outside
and
when
exhausted
nature
defies
even
these
enemies
of
rest
then
the
doctor
who
seems
to
be
in
the
pay
of
insanity
claps
you
on
a
blister
by
brute
force
and
so
drives
away
sleep
insanity
cure
or
hocuses
you
by
brute
force
as
he
did
me
and
so
steals
your
sleep
and
tries
to
steal
your
reason
with
his
opium
henbane
morphia
and
other
tremendous
with
such
a
potion
sir
administered
by
violence
he
gave
me
in
one
night
a
bursting
fever
headache
loss
of
sight
and
bleeding
at
the
nose
as
archbold
will
tell
you
oh
look
into
these
things
sir
in
pity
to
those
whom
heaven
has
afflicted
to
me
they
are
but
strokes
with
a
feather
i
am
a
sane
man
torn
from
love
and
happiness
and
confined
among
the
mad
discomfort
is
nothing
to
me
comfort
is
nothing
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
but
restore
me
to
my
dignity
as
a
man
my
liberty
as
a
briton
and
the
rights
as
a
citizen
i
have
been
swindled
out
of
by
a
fraudulent
bankrupt
and
his
tools
two
venal
doctors
who
never
saw
me
but
for
one
five
minutes
but
came
to
me
ready
bribed
at
a
guinea
apiece
and
so
signed
away
my
wits
behind
my
now
baker
said
vane
what
do
you
say
to
all
this
baker
smiled
with
admirable
composure
and
replied
with
crafty
moderation
he
is
a
gentleman
and
believes
every
word
he
says
but
it
is
all
his
delusions
why
to
begin
sir
his
father
has
nothing
to
do
with
putting
him
in
here
nothing
on
earth
alfred
started
then
smiled
incredulous
and
in
the
next
place
there
are
no
instruments
of
restraint
here
but
two
pair
of
handcuffs
and
two
strait
jackets
and
these
never
hardly
used
we
trust
to
the
padded
rooms
you
know
and
sir
said
he
getting
warm
which
instantly
affected
his
pronunciations
if
there
a
hinsect
in
the
ouse
i
heat
delusion
is
a
big
word
especially
in
a
it
overpowers
a
visitor
understanding
vane
was
staggered
alfred
whose
eager
eyes
were
never
off
his
face
saw
this
with
dismay
and
feeling
that
if
he
failed
in
the
simpler
matter
he
should
be
sure
to
fail
in
establishing
his
sanity
he
said
with
inward
anxiety
though
with
outward
calmness
suppose
we
test
these
delusions
with
all
my
heart
said
vane
baker
countenance
fell
begin
with
the
instruments
of
restraint
find
me
baker
countenance
brightened
up
he
had
no
fear
of
their
being
found
i
will
said
alfred
please
to
follow
baker
grinned
with
anticipated
triumph
alfred
led
the
way
to
a
bedroom
near
his
own
and
asked
baker
to
unlock
it
baker
had
not
the
key
no
more
had
cooper
the
latter
was
sent
for
it
he
returned
saying
the
key
was
mislaid
that
i
expected
said
alfred
send
for
the
kitchen
poker
sir
soon
unlock
fetch
the
kitchen
poker
said
vane
good
gracious
sir
said
cooper
he
only
wants
that
to
knock
all
our
brains
out
you
have
no
idea
of
his
strength
and
well
lied
cooper
said
alfred
ironically
fetch
the
poker
said
vane
cooper
went
for
it
and
came
back
with
the
key
instead
the
door
was
opened
and
they
all
entered
alfred
looked
under
the
bed
the
rest
stood
round
it
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
year
dust
alfred
was
and
a
cold
perspiration
began
to
gather
on
his
brow
he
saw
at
once
a
false
move
would
be
fatal
to
him
well
sir
said
vane
grimly
where
are
they
alfred
caught
sight
of
a
small
cupboard
he
searched
it
it
was
empty
baker
and
cooper
grinned
at
his
delusion
quietly
but
so
that
vane
might
see
that
formula
alfred
returned
to
the
bed
and
shook
it
cooper
and
baker
left
off
grinning
alfred
quick
eye
caught
this
and
he
shook
the
bed
violently
furiously
ah
said
vane
i
hear
a
it
is
an
iron
bedstead
and
old
suggested
baker
alfred
tore
off
the
and
then
the
mattress
below
the
latter
was
a
framework
and
below
the
framework
a
receptacle
about
six
inches
deep
five
feet
long
and
three
broad
filled
with
chains
iron
belts
muffles
and
hobbles
a
regular
inquisition
if
baker
had
descended
from
the
kemble
family
instead
of
rising
from
nothing
he
could
not
have
acted
better
good
heavens
cried
he
where
do
these
come
from
they
must
have
been
left
here
by
the
last
vane
replied
only
by
a
look
of
contempt
and
ordered
cooper
to
go
and
ask
tollett
to
come
to
him
alfred
improved
the
interval
sir
said
he
all
my
delusions
fairly
tested
will
turn
out
like
they
be
tested
sir
i
give
you
my
tollett
came
and
the
two
justices
commenced
a
genuine
scrutiny
their
first
they
went
now
upon
the
true
method
in
which
all
these
dark
places
ought
to
be
inspected
they
did
not
believe
a
word
they
suspected
everything
they
examined
patients
apart
detected
cruelty
filth
and
vermin
under
philanthropic
phrases
and
clean
linen
and
the
upshot
was
they
reprimanded
baker
and
the
attendants
severely
and
told
him
his
licence
should
never
be
renewed
unless
at
their
next
visit
the
whole
asylum
was
reformed
they
ordered
all
the
iron
chains
and
muffs
to
be
put
into
tollett
carriage
and
concluded
a
long
inspection
by
inquiring
into
alfred
sanity
at
this
inquiry
they
did
not
allow
baker
to
be
even
present
but
only
bailey
first
they
read
the
order
and
found
it
really
was
not
alfred
father
who
had
put
him
into
the
asylum
then
they
read
the
certificates
especially
wycherley
it
accused
alfred
of
headache
insomnia
nightly
visions
a
rooted
delusion
pecuniary
a
sudden
aversion
to
an
affectionate
father
and
at
the
doctor
last
visit
a
wild
look
formula
great
excitement
and
threats
of
violence
without
any
provocation
to
justify
them
this
overpowered
the
worthy
understandings
to
begin
but
they
proceeded
to
examine
the
three
books
an
asylum
has
to
keep
by
law
the
visitor
book
the
case
book
and
the
medical
journal
all
these
were
kept
with
the
utmost
looseness
in
silverton
house
as
indeed
they
are
in
the
very
best
of
these
places
however
by
combining
the
scanty
notices
in
the
several
books
they
arrived
at
this
total
admitted
april
had
a
very
wild
look
and
was
much
excited
attempted
suicide
by
throwing
himself
into
a
tank
attacked
the
keepers
for
rescuing
him
with
prodigious
strength
and
violence
refused
and
some
days
after
came
an
entry
with
his
initials
instead
of
his
name
which
was
contrary
to
law
a
much
excited
threats
ordered
composing
and
a
day
or
two
after
a
excited
blasphemous
ordered
the
first
entry
however
was
enough
the
doctor
had
but
seen
real
facts
through
his
green
spectacles
and
lo
suicide
homicide
and
refusal
of
food
three
cardinal
points
of
true
mania
vane
asked
bailey
whether
he
was
better
since
he
came
oh
infinitely
better
said
bailey
we
hope
to
cure
him
in
a
month
or
they
then
sent
for
archbold
and
had
a
long
talk
with
her
recommending
alfred
to
her
especial
care
and
having
acted
on
his
judgment
and
information
in
the
teeth
of
those
who
called
him
insane
turned
tail
at
a
doctor
certificate
distrusted
their
eyesight
at
an
unsworn
affidavit
alfred
was
packing
up
his
things
to
go
away
bright
as
a
lark
archbold
came
to
him
and
told
him
she
had
orders
to
give
him
every
comfort
and
the
justices
hoped
to
liberate
him
at
their
next
visit
the
poor
wretch
turned
pale
at
their
next
visit
he
cried
what
not
when
is
their
next
visit
archbold
hesitated
but
at
last
she
said
why
you
know
i
told
you
they
come
four
times
every
the
disappointment
was
too
bitter
the
contemptible
result
of
all
his
patience
and
success
was
too
he
groaned
aloud
and
you
can
come
with
a
smile
and
tell
me
that
you
cruel
then
he
broke
down
altogether
and
burst
out
crying
you
were
born
without
a
heart
he
sobbed
archbold
quivered
at
that
i
wish
i
had
been
said
she
in
a
strange
soft
moving
voice
then
casting
an
eloquent
look
of
reproach
on
him
she
went
away
in
visible
agitation
and
left
him
sobbing
once
out
of
his
sight
she
rushed
into
another
room
and
there
taking
no
more
notice
of
a
gentle
madwoman
its
occupant
than
of
the
bed
or
the
table
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
throwing
her
head
back
with
womanly
abandon
hid
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
that
heaved
tempestuously
and
soon
the
tears
trickled
out
of
her
imperious
eyes
and
ran
unrestrained
the
mind
of
edith
archbold
corresponded
with
her
powerful
frame
and
bushy
brows
inside
this
woman
all
was
vigour
strong
passions
strong
good
sense
to
check
or
hide
them
strong
will
to
carry
them
out
and
between
these
mental
forces
a
powerful
struggle
was
raging
she
was
almost
impenetrable
to
mere
personal
beauty
and
inclined
to
despise
early
youth
in
the
other
sex
and
six
months
spent
with
alfred
in
a
quiet
country
house
would
probably
have
left
her
reasonably
indifferent
to
him
but
the
first
day
she
saw
him
in
silverton
house
he
broke
through
her
guard
and
pierced
at
once
to
her
depths
first
he
terrified
her
by
darting
through
the
window
to
escape
and
terror
is
a
passion
so
is
pity
and
never
in
her
life
had
she
overflowed
with
it
as
when
she
saw
him
drawn
out
of
the
tank
and
laid
on
the
grass
if
after
all
he
was
as
sane
as
he
looked
that
brave
young
creature
who
preferred
death
to
the
touch
of
coarse
confining
hands
no
sooner
had
he
filled
her
with
dismay
and
pity
than
he
bounded
from
the
ground
before
her
eyes
and
fled
she
screamed
and
hoped
he
would
escape
she
could
not
help
it
next
she
saw
him
fighting
alone
against
seven
or
eight
and
with
prowess
almost
beating
them
she
sat
at
the
window
panting
with
clenched
teeth
and
hands
and
wished
him
to
beat
and
admired
him
wondered
at
him
he
yielded
but
not
to
them
to
her
all
the
compliments
she
had
ever
received
were
tame
compared
with
this
one
it
thrilled
her
vanity
he
was
like
the
men
she
had
read
of
and
never
seen
the
young
knights
of
chivalry
she
glowed
all
over
at
him
and
detecting
herself
in
time
was
frightened
her
strong
good
sense
warned
her
to
beware
of
this
youth
who
was
nine
years
her
junior
yet
had
stirred
her
to
all
her
depths
in
an
hour
and
not
to
see
him
nor
think
of
him
too
much
accordingly
she
kept
clear
of
him
altogether
at
first
pity
soon
put
an
end
to
that
and
she
protected
and
advised
him
but
with
a
cold
and
lofty
demeanour
put
on
express
what
with
her
kind
acts
and
her
cold
manner
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
her
and
often
turned
puzzled
earnest
eyes
upon
her
as
much
as
to
say
are
you
really
my
friend
or
not
once
she
forgot
herself
and
smiled
so
tenderly
in
answer
to
these
imploring
eyes
that
his
hopes
rose
very
high
indeed
he
flattered
himself
she
would
let
him
out
of
the
asylum
before
long
that
was
all
julia
true
lover
thought
of
a
feeling
hidden
and
not
suppressed
often
grows
fast
in
a
vigorous
nature
archbold
fancy
for
alfred
was
subjected
to
this
dangerous
treatment
and
it
smouldered
and
smouldered
till
from
a
it
warmed
to
a
fancy
from
a
fancy
to
a
passion
but
fancy
or
passion
she
hid
it
with
such
cunning
and
resolution
that
neither
alfred
nor
even
those
of
her
own
sex
saw
it
nor
did
a
creature
even
suspect
it
except
nurse
hannah
but
her
eyes
were
sharpened
by
jealousy
for
that
muscular
young
virgin
was
beginning
to
sigh
for
him
herself
with
a
gentle
timidity
that
contrasted
prettily
with
her
biceps
muscle
and
prowess
against
her
own
sex
archbold
had
more
passion
than
tenderness
but
what
woman
is
not
to
be
surprised
and
softened
when
her
young
favourite
the
greatest
fighter
she
had
ever
seen
broke
down
at
the
end
of
his
gallant
effort
and
began
to
cry
like
a
girl
her
bowels
of
compassion
yearned
within
her
and
she
longed
to
cry
with
him
she
only
saved
herself
from
some
imprudence
by
flight
and
had
her
cry
alone
after
a
flow
of
tears
such
a
woman
is
invincible
she
treated
alfred
at
with
remarkable
coldness
and
reserve
this
piece
of
acting
led
to
consequences
it
emboldened
cooper
who
was
raging
against
alfred
for
telling
the
justices
but
had
forborne
from
violence
for
fear
of
getting
the
house
into
a
fresh
scrape
he
now
went
to
the
doctor
and
asked
for
a
powerful
drastic
bailey
gave
him
two
pills
or
rather
boluses
containing
croton
oil
alia
for
bailey
was
one
of
the
fools
of
the
unscientific
science
armed
with
this
weapon
of
destruction
cooper
entered
alfred
bedroom
at
night
and
ordered
him
to
take
them
he
refused
cooper
whistled
and
four
attendants
came
alfred
knew
he
should
soon
be
powerless
he
lost
no
time
sprang
at
cooper
and
with
his
long
arm
landed
a
blow
that
knocked
him
against
the
wall
and
in
this
position
where
his
body
could
not
give
struck
him
again
with
his
whole
soul
and
cut
his
cheek
right
open
the
next
minute
he
was
pinned
handcuffed
and
in
a
straitjacket
after
crippling
one
assailant
with
a
kick
on
the
knee
cooper
half
stunned
and
bleeding
like
a
pig
recovered
himself
now
and
burned
for
revenge
he
uttered
a
frightful
oath
and
jumped
on
alfred
as
he
lay
bound
and
powerless
and
gave
him
a
lesson
he
never
forgot
every
art
has
its
secrets
the
attendants
in
such
madhouses
as
this
have
been
for
years
possessed
of
one
they
are
too
modest
to
reveal
to
justices
commissioners
or
the
public
the
art
of
breaking
a
ribs
or
or
both
without
bruising
him
externally
the
convicts
at
toulon
arrive
at
a
similar
result
by
another
branch
of
the
art
they
stuff
the
skin
of
a
conger
eel
with
powdered
stone
then
give
the
obnoxious
person
a
sly
crack
with
it
and
a
rib
backbone
is
broken
with
no
contusion
to
mark
the
external
violence
used
but
cooper
and
his
fellows
do
their
work
with
the
it
is
round
and
leaves
no
bruise
they
subdue
the
patient
by
walking
up
and
down
him
on
their
knees
if
they
do
jump
on
him
as
well
as
promenade
him
the
spirit
is
often
the
only
thing
broken
if
they
do
the
man
is
apt
to
be
broken
bodily
as
well
as
mentally
thus
died
sizer
in
and
two
others
quite
recently
and
how
many
more
god
only
knows
we
ca
count
the
stones
at
the
bottom
of
a
dark
well
cooper
then
sprang
furiously
on
alfred
and
went
kneeling
up
and
down
him
cooper
was
a
heavy
man
and
his
weight
crushed
and
hurt
the
victim
legs
but
that
was
a
trifle
as
often
as
he
kneeled
on
chest
the
crushed
one
whole
framework
seemed
giving
way
and
he
could
scarcely
breathe
but
brown
drew
cooper
back
by
the
collar
saying
d
want
to
kill
him
and
at
this
moment
archbold
who
was
on
the
watch
came
in
with
hannah
and
another
nurse
and
the
three
women
at
a
word
from
their
leader
pinned
cooper
simultaneously
and
taking
him
at
a
disadvantage
handcuffed
him
in
a
moment
with
a
strength
sharpness
skill
and
determination
not
to
be
found
in
women
out
of
a
madhouse
luckily
for
the
newspaper
husbands
the
other
keepers
looked
astounded
at
this
masterstroke
but
as
no
servant
had
ever
affronted
archbold
without
being
dismissed
directly
they
took
their
cue
and
said
we
advised
him
but
he
would
not
listen
to
cooper
said
archbold
as
soon
as
she
recovered
her
breath
you
are
not
fit
for
your
place
you
go
or
i
cooper
cowed
in
a
moment
by
the
handcuffs
began
to
whine
and
say
that
it
was
all
alfred
fault
but
archbold
was
now
carried
away
by
two
passions
instead
of
one
and
they
were
together
too
much
for
prudence
she
took
a
handful
of
glossy
locks
out
of
her
bosom
and
shook
them
in
cooper
face
you
monster
said
she
you
should
go
for
if
you
were
my
own
the
two
young
nurses
assented
loudly
and
turned
and
cackled
at
cooper
for
cutting
off
such
lovely
hair
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
them
and
said
sulkily
to
archbold
oh
i
did
know
of
course
if
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
him
my
cake
is
burnt
is
the
first
lunatic
you
have
taken
a
fancy
at
this
brutal
speech
all
the
more
intolerable
for
not
being
quite
false
archbold
turned
ashy
pale
and
looked
round
for
a
weapon
to
strike
him
dead
but
found
none
so
handy
and
so
deadly
as
her
tongue
it
not
the
first
you
have
tried
to
murder
said
she
i
know
all
about
that
death
in
calton
retreat
you
kept
it
dark
before
the
coroner
but
it
is
not
too
late
i
open
the
world
eyes
i
was
only
going
to
dismiss
you
sir
but
you
have
insulted
me
i
hang
you
in
cooper
turned
very
pale
and
was
silent
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
but
a
feeble
unexpected
voice
issued
from
the
bed
and
murmured
cheerfully
though
with
some
difficulty
a
single
word
justice
at
an
expression
so
out
of
place
they
all
started
with
surprise
alfred
went
on
you
are
putting
the
saddle
on
the
wrong
horse
the
fault
lies
with
those
villains
baker
and
bailey
cooper
is
only
a
servant
you
know
and
obeys
what
business
had
the
wretch
to
cut
your
hair
off
said
archbold
turning
on
alfred
with
flashing
eyes
her
blood
once
up
she
was
ready
to
quarrel
even
with
him
for
taking
part
against
himself
because
he
was
ordered
to
put
on
a
blister
and
hair
must
come
off
before
a
blister
can
go
on
replied
alfred
soberly
that
is
no
excuse
for
him
beating
you
and
trying
to
break
your
front
she
did
mind
so
much
about
his
side
ribs
no
replied
alfred
but
i
hit
him
first
look
at
the
bloke
face
dear
archbold
you
are
my
best
friend
in
this
horrid
place
and
you
have
beautiful
eyes
and
talk
of
teeth
look
at
yours
but
you
much
sense
of
justice
forgive
me
for
saying
so
put
the
proposition
into
signs
there
is
nothing
like
that
for
clearing
away
prejudice
and
have
a
scrimmage
b
begins
it
gets
the
worst
of
it
in
comes
and
turns
away
is
that
justice
it
is
me
you
ought
to
turn
away
and
i
wish
to
heaven
you
would
dear
archbold
do
pray
turn
me
away
and
keep
the
other
at
this
extraordinary
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
alfredian
speech
the
men
first
stared
and
then
laughed
the
women
smiled
and
then
were
nearer
crying
than
laughing
and
so
it
was
that
justice
handcuffed
straitjacketed
blistered
and
impartial
sent
from
its
bed
of
torture
a
beam
through
cooper
tough
hide
to
his
inner
heart
he
hung
his
head
and
stepped
towards
alfred
you
what
i
call
a
man
he
said
i
do
care
a
curse
whether
i
stay
or
go
after
what
she
has
said
to
me
but
come
what
may
you
a
gentleman
and
one
as
can
put
hisself
in
a
poor
man
place
why
sir
i
was
always
so
rough
but
i
have
been
twenty
years
at
it
and
mad
folk
they
wear
the
patience
out
of
jove
and
the
milk
of
human
kindness
out
of
saints
and
opossums
however
if
i
was
to
stay
here
all
my
life
instead
of
going
i
never
lift
hand
to
trouble
you
again
for
you
taking
my
part
again
yourself
like
i
put
that
to
the
test
said
archbold
sharply
stay
on
your
probation
hannah
and
biceps
at
a
look
took
off
his
handcuffs
which
she
had
been
prominent
in
putting
on
this
extraordinary
scene
ended
in
the
men
being
dismissed
and
the
women
remaining
and
going
to
work
after
their
kind
the
bed
is
too
short
for
one
thing
said
hannah
look
at
his
poor
feet
sticking
out
and
cold
as
a
stone
just
feel
of
them
no
no
murder
cried
alfred
that
hannah
ran
for
a
chair
jane
for
another
pillow
archbold
took
off
his
handcuffs
and
passing
her
hand
softly
and
caressingly
over
his
head
lamented
the
loss
of
his
poor
hair
amongst
them
they
relieved
him
of
his
straitjacket
set
up
his
head
covered
his
feet
and
he
slept
like
a
top
for
want
of
drastics
and
opiates
and
in
spite
of
some
brilliant
charges
by
the
lilliputian
cavalry
after
this
the
attendants
never
molested
alfred
again
nor
did
the
doctor
for
archbold
got
his
boluses
and
sent
them
up
to
a
famous
analysing
chemist
in
london
and
told
him
she
had
and
said
i
thank
you
not
to
prescribe
at
random
for
patient
any
he
took
the
lady
prescription
coming
as
it
did
in
a
voice
quietly
grim
and
with
a
momentary
but
wicked
glance
shot
from
under
her
black
brows
alfred
was
all
the
more
miserable
at
his
confinement
his
melancholy
deepened
now
there
was
no
fighting
to
excite
him
a
handsome
bright
young
face
clouded
with
sadness
is
very
pitiable
and
i
need
not
say
that
both
the
women
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
had
their
eyes
or
at
least
the
tails
of
their
eyes
for
ever
on
his
face
the
result
varied
with
the
characters
of
the
watchers
that
young
face
ever
sad
made
archbold
sigh
and
long
to
make
him
happy
under
her
wing
how
it
wrought
on
the
purer
and
more
womanly
hannah
will
be
revealed
by
the
incident
i
have
to
relate
alfred
was
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
corridor
bowed
down
by
grief
and
the
archbold
lurking
in
a
room
hard
by
feasting
her
eyes
on
him
through
an
aperture
in
the
door
caused
by
the
inspection
plate
being
under
repair
when
an
erotic
maniac
was
driven
past
she
had
obtained
access
with
marvellous
cunning
to
the
side
but
was
now
coming
back
with
a
flea
in
her
ear
and
faster
than
she
went
being
handcuffed
and
propelled
by
biceps
on
passing
the
disconsolate
alfred
the
latter
eyed
him
coyly
gave
her
stray
sheep
a
coarse
push
as
one
pushes
a
and
laid
a
timid
hand
gentle
as
falling
down
upon
the
rougher
sex
contrast
sudden
and
funny
do
be
so
sad
sir
she
murmured
cooing
like
the
gentlest
of
doves
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
look
like
alfred
looked
up
and
met
her
full
with
his
mournful
honest
eyes
ah
hannah
how
can
i
be
anything
but
sad
imprisoned
here
sane
amongst
the
mad
well
and
so
am
i
sir
so
is
archbold
ay
but
you
have
not
been
entrapped
imprisoned
on
your
i
can
not
even
get
a
word
sent
to
my
julia
my
wife
that
ought
to
be
only
think
of
the
affront
they
have
made
me
put
on
her
i
love
better
ten
times
better
than
myself
why
she
must
have
been
waiting
for
me
humiliated
perhaps
by
my
absence
what
will
she
think
of
me
the
rogues
will
tell
her
a
thousand
lies
she
is
very
high
spirited
hannah
impetuous
like
myself
only
so
gentle
and
so
good
oh
my
angel
my
angel
i
shall
lose
you
for
hannah
clasped
her
hands
with
tears
in
her
eyes
no
no
she
cried
it
is
a
burning
shame
to
part
true
lovers
like
you
and
her
hush
speak
low
brown
told
me
you
are
as
well
as
he
god
bless
him
for
it
you
have
got
money
they
say
try
it
on
with
i
will
oh
you
darling
what
is
the
matter
for
was
beginning
to
whimper
oh
nothing
sir
only
you
are
so
glad
to
go
and
we
shall
be
sorry
to
part
with
you
but
you
wo
care
for
that
oh
oh
oh
what
do
you
think
i
shall
forget
you
and
your
kindness
never
square
accounts
with
friends
and
foes
not
one
shall
be
do
offer
me
any
of
your
money
sobbed
hannah
for
i
would
touch
it
said
she
i
sha
have
as
much
as
a
kiss
for
it
i
be
bound
said
she
again
and
never
moved
oh
wo
you
though
cried
alfred
gaily
what
is
that
and
that
and
that
now
what
on
earth
are
you
crying
about
dry
your
tears
you
dear
girl
no
i
dry
them
for
he
took
out
a
white
handkerchief
and
dried
her
cheeks
gently
for
her
and
gave
her
a
parting
kiss
but
the
archbold
patience
was
exhausted
a
door
opened
nearly
opposite
and
there
she
stood
yellow
with
jealousy
and
sombre
as
night
with
her
ebon
brows
at
sight
of
this
lowering
figure
hannah
uttered
a
squawk
and
fled
with
cheeks
red
as
fire
alfred
not
aware
of
archbold
smouldering
passion
and
little
dreaming
that
jealous
anguish
and
rage
stood
incarnate
before
him
burst
out
laughing
like
a
mischievous
boy
on
this
she
swept
upon
him
and
took
him
by
both
shoulders
and
awed
him
with
her
lowering
brows
close
to
his
you
ungrateful
wretch
she
said
violently
and
panted
his
colour
rose
ungrateful
that
i
am
not
madam
why
do
you
call
me
so
you
are
you
are
what
have
i
done
to
you
that
you
run
from
me
to
the
very
servants
however
she
shall
be
packed
off
this
very
night
and
you
to
thank
for
this
was
the
way
to
wound
the
generous
youth
now
it
is
you
that
are
ungenerous
he
said
what
harm
has
the
poor
girl
done
she
had
a
virtuous
movement
and
pitied
me
for
the
heartless
fraud
i
suffer
by
that
is
all
pray
do
you
never
pity
me
was
it
this
virtuous
movement
set
her
kissing
you
said
the
archbold
clenching
her
teeth
as
if
the
word
stung
her
like
the
sight
she
did
now
said
alfred
it
was
i
kissed
and
yet
you
pretend
to
love
your
julia
so
truly
this
is
no
place
for
that
sacred
name
madam
but
be
sure
i
have
no
secrets
from
her
and
kiss
nobody
she
would
not
kiss
she
must
be
a
very
accommodating
young
at
this
insult
alfred
rose
pale
with
anger
and
was
about
to
defy
his
monitor
mortally
but
the
woman
saw
and
disarmed
him
in
one
moment
before
ever
he
could
speak
she
was
a
transformed
creature
a
penitent
she
put
her
hands
together
supplicatingly
and
murmured
i
did
mean
it
i
respect
and
your
love
for
her
forgive
me
alfred
i
am
so
unhappy
oh
forgive
and
behold
she
held
his
hand
between
her
soft
burning
palms
and
her
proud
head
sank
languidly
on
his
shoulder
and
the
inevitable
tears
ran
gently
morals
apart
it
was
glorious
bother
the
woman
thought
alfred
promise
me
not
to
do
it
again
she
murmured
and
the
girl
shall
oh
lord
yes
i
promise
though
i
ca
see
what
it
matters
to
not
much
cruel
boy
alas
but
it
matters
to
her
for
she
kissed
alfred
hand
gently
and
rose
to
her
feet
and
moved
away
but
at
the
second
step
turned
her
head
sudden
as
a
bird
and
finished
her
sentence
if
you
kiss
her
before
me
i
shall
kill
her
before
here
was
a
fresh
complication
the
men
had
left
off
blistering
torturing
and
bullying
him
but
his
guardian
angels
the
women
were
turning
up
their
sleeves
to
pull
caps
over
him
and
plenty
of
the
random
scratches
would
fall
on
him
if
anything
could
have
made
him
pine
more
to
be
out
of
the
horrid
place
this
voluptuous
prospect
would
he
hunted
everywhere
for
brown
but
he
was
away
the
day
with
a
patient
at
night
he
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
thinking
how
he
should
open
the
negotiation
he
shrank
from
it
he
felt
a
delicacy
about
bribing
beelzebub
servant
to
betray
him
as
hannah
had
originated
the
idea
he
thought
he
might
very
well
ask
her
to
do
the
dirty
work
of
bribing
brown
and
he
would
pay
her
for
it
only
in
money
not
kisses
with
this
resolution
he
sank
to
sleep
and
his
spirit
broke
prison
he
stood
with
julia
before
the
altar
and
the
priest
made
them
one
then
the
church
and
the
company
and
daylight
disappeared
and
her
own
sweet
low
moving
voice
came
thrilling
my
own
own
own
she
murmured
i
love
you
ten
times
more
for
all
you
have
endured
for
me
and
with
this
her
sweet
lips
settled
on
his
like
the
dew
impartial
sleep
flies
at
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
and
the
gate
of
elysium
so
alfred
awoke
at
the
above
but
doubted
whether
he
was
quite
awake
for
two
velvet
lips
seemed
to
be
still
touching
his
he
stirred
and
somebody
was
gone
like
the
wind
with
a
rustle
of
flying
petticoats
and
his
door
shut
in
a
moment
it
closed
with
a
this
dastardly
vision
had
opened
it
with
her
key
and
left
it
open
to
make
good
her
retreat
if
he
should
awake
alfred
sat
up
in
bed
indignant
and
somewhat
fluttered
confound
her
impudence
said
he
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
grinned
and
bore
it
as
he
had
the
blisters
and
boluses
rolled
the
clothes
round
his
shoulders
and
off
to
the
sleep
of
the
just
again
not
so
the
passionate
hypocrite
who
maddened
by
a
paroxysm
of
jealousy
had
taken
this
cowardly
advantage
of
a
prisoner
she
had
sucked
fresh
poison
from
those
honest
lips
and
filled
her
veins
with
molten
fire
she
tossed
and
turned
the
livelong
night
in
a
high
fever
of
passion
nor
were
the
cold
chills
wanting
of
shame
and
fear
at
what
she
had
done
in
the
morning
alfred
remembered
this
substantial
vision
and
determined
to
find
out
which
of
those
two
it
was
i
shall
know
by
her
looks
said
he
she
wo
be
able
to
meet
my
well
the
first
he
saw
was
archbold
she
met
his
eye
full
with
a
mild
and
pensive
dignity
come
it
is
not
you
thought
alfred
presently
he
fell
in
with
hannah
she
wore
a
serene
infantine
face
the
picture
of
unobtrusive
modesty
alfred
was
dumbfoundered
it
not
this
one
either
said
he
but
then
it
must
confound
her
impudence
for
looking
so
however
he
did
not
speak
to
her
he
was
looking
out
for
a
face
that
interested
him
far
more
the
countenance
of
giles
brown
he
saw
him
once
or
twice
but
could
not
get
him
alone
till
the
afternoon
he
invited
him
into
his
room
and
when
he
got
him
there
lost
no
time
just
look
me
in
the
face
brown
said
he
quietly
brown
looked
him
in
the
face

turned
his
head
away
alfred
laughed

in
the
face
while

man
coloured

as
much

much
as

i
must
trouble

to
look
in
my
face
again
brown
now
do
you

treason
bad
faith
avarice
ingratitude
rascality

it
not
a
grain
of
said
brown
with
an
accent
of
conviction
well
now
i
tell
you
the
truth

read
a
gent
by
this
time
and
i
no

in
my
hand
but

see
my
stomach
wo

this
was
a
sad
disappointment
so
sudden
too
your
stomach
said
alfred
ruefully

my
stomach
would
stomach

against
serving

man
that

done
you
the
worst
turn
one
man
can
do
another
been
and
robbed
you
of
your
sweetheart
alfred
stared
with
amazement
brown
continued
and
now
with
some
emotion
hannah
blake
and
i
were
very
good
friends
till
you
came
and
i
was
thinking
of
asking
her
to
name
the
day
but
now
she
wo
look
at
me
come
teasing
me
says
she
am
meat
for
your
master
it
you
that
have
turned
the
girl

women
said
alfred
cordially
oh
what
plagues
they
are
and
how
unjust
are
to
spite
me
for
the
fault
of
another
can
i
help
the
fools
from
spooning
upon
me
he
reflected
a
moment
then
burst
out
brown
you
are
a
duffer
a
regular
duffer
what
do
you
see
your
game
is
to
get
me
out
of
the
place
if
you
do
in
hours
i
shall
be
married
to
my
julia
and
that
girl
will
be
cured
but
if
you
keep
me
here
by
gee
sir
i
make
hot
love
to
your
hannah
boiling
hot
hotter
than
ever
was
out
of
the
isles
of
greece
oh
do
help
me
out
and
i
give
you
the
hundred
pounds
and
i
give
hannah
another
hundred
pounds
on
condition

marries
you
and
if
she
wo
marry
you
she
sha
have
a
farthing
only
a
good
brown
was
overpowered
by
his
maniac
logic
you
have
a
head
said
he
there
my
hand
i
go
in
if
i
die
for
they
now
put
their
heads
together
over
the
means
brown
plan
was
to
wait
and
wait
for
an
opportunity
alfred
was
to
make
one
this
very
night
but
how
can
i
said
brown
i
sha
have
the
key
of
your
room
i
am
not
on
watch
in
your
part
borrow
hannah
she
has
got
no
key
of
the
male
patients
oh
yes
she
has
of
mine
at
all
what
makes
you
think
that
sir
said
brown
suspiciously
alfred
did
know
what
to
say
he
could
not
tell
him
why
he
felt
sure
she
had
a
key
just
go
quietly
and
ask
her
for
it
said
he
do
tell
her
i
sent
you
brown
obeyed
and
returned
in
with
the
key
of
the
vacant
bedroom
where
the
hobbles
and
chains
were
hidden
on
the
arrival
of
the
justices
she
tells
me
this
is
the
only
key
she
has
of
any
room
in
this
corridor
but
dear
heart
said
brown
how
quicksighted
the
women
are
she
said
says
she
it
is
to
bring
sorrowful
true
lovers
together
again
giles
or
the
like
of
that
i
try
and
get
the
key
you
want
off
archbold
bunch
though
i
get
the
sack
for
it
says
she
know
she
heaves
them
in
the
parlour
at
night
says
hannah
she
is
a
trump
you
must
alfred
coloured
up
he
suspected
he
had
been
unjust
she
is
a
good
kind
girl
said
he
and
neither
of
you
shall
find
me
it
was
evident
by
the
alacrity
brown
now
showed
that
he
had
got
his
orders
from
hannah
it
was
agreed
that
alfred
should
be
down
at
night
in
his
clothes
ready
to
seize
the
right
moment
that
hannah
should
get
the
key
and
watch
the
coast
clear
and
let
him
out
into
the
corridor
and
brown
get
him
down
by
a
back
stairs
and
out
on
the
lawn
there
he
would
find
a
ladder
close
by
the
wall
and
his
own
arms
and
legs
must
do
the
rest
and
now
alfred
was
a
changed
creature
his
eye
sparkled
he
walked
on
air
and
already
sniffed
the
air
of
liberty
after
tea
brown
brought
in
some
newspapers
and
made
alfred
a
signal
previously
agreed
on
that
the
ladder
was
under
the
east
wall
he
went
to
bed
early
put
on
his
tweed
and
trousers
and
lay
listening
to
the
clock
with
beating
heart
at
first
feet
passed
to
and
fro
from
time
to
time
these
became
less
frequent
as
the
night
wore
on
presently
a
light
foot
passed
stopped
at
the
door
and
made
a
sharp
scratch
on
it
with
some
metal
instrument
it
was
the
key
the
time
was
not
ripe
to
use
it
but
good
hannah
had
taken
this
way
to
let
him
know
she
had
got
it
this
little
scratch
outside
his
door
oh
it
made
his
heart
leap
and
thrill
one
great
difficulty
was
overcome
he
waited
and
waited
but
with
glowing
hopeful
heart
and
at
last
a
foot
came
swiftly
the
key
turned
and
hannah
opened
the
door
she
had
a
lantern
take
your
shoes
in
your
hand
she
whispered
and
follow
he
followed
her
she
led
him
in
and
out
to
the
door
of
the
public
room
belonging
to
the
patients
then
she
drew
her
whistle
and
breathed
very
softly
brown
answered
as
softly
from
the
other
end
he
was
waiting
at
the
opposite
door
all
right
said
she
the
dangerous
part
is
she
put
a
key
into
the
door
and
said
very
softly
god
bless
you
hannah
said
alfred
with
deep
emotion
god
in
heaven
bless
you
for
this
he
will
he
does
said
the
girl
and
put
her
other
hand
to
her
breast
with
a
great
gulp
she
opened
the
door
slowly
dear
i
shall
never
see
you
and
so
these
two
parted
for
hannah
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
giles
at
that
moment
he
was
welcome
to
alfred
though
most
welcome
and
conducted
him
by
devious
ways
to
the
kitchen
lantern
in
hand
he
opened
the
kitchen
door
softly
and
saw
two
burly
strangers
seated
at
the
table
eating
with
all
their
souls
and
archbold
standing
before
the
fire
but
looking
towards
him
for
she
had
heard
his
footsteps
ever
so
far
off
the
men
looked
up
and
saw
alfred
they
rose
to
their
feet
and
said
this
will
be
the
gentleman
madam
yes
said
archbold
your
servant
sir
said
the
man
very
civilly
if
you
are
ready
we
chapter
xxxiv
sampson
placard
was
on
barkington
walls
and
inside
the
asylum
alfred
was
softening
hearts
and
buying
consciences
as
related
so
in
fact
he
had
two
strings
to
his
bow
but
mark
how
strangely
things
turn
these
two
strings
got
entangled
his
father
alarmed
by
the
placard
had
called
at
the
pawnbroker
shop
and
told
him
he
must
move
alfred
directly
to
a
london
asylum
baker
raised
objections
hardie
crushed
them
with
his
purse
with
his
son
and
victim
sweetheart
father
money
so
then
as
baker
after
all
could
not
resist
the
project
but
only
postpone
it
for
a
day
or
two
he
preferred
to
take
a
handsome
present
and
cooperate
he
even
connived
at
hardie
signing
the
requisite
name
to
the
new
order
this
the
giddy
world
calls
forgery
but
in
these
calm
retreats
far
from
the
public
inquisitive
eye
it
goes
for
nothing
why
archbold
had
signed
baker
name
and
bailey
more
than
a
hundred
several
times
to
orders
statements
and
certificates
depriving
englishmen
of
their
liberty
and
their
property
with
a
gesture
of
her
taper
fingers
and
venting
the
conventional
terms
aberration
exaltation
depression
debility
paralysis
excitable
abnormal
as
boldly
and
blindly
as
any
male
starling
in
the
flock
on
the
very
night
then
of
alfred
projected
escape
two
keepers
came
down
from
wycherley
asylum
to
silverton
station
baker
met
them
and
drove
them
to
silverton
house
in
his
they
were
to
take
alfred
up
by
the
night
train
and
when
he
came
into
the
kitchen
with
brown
they
suspected
nothing
nor
did
baker
or
cooper
who
presently
emerged
from
the
back
kitchen
brown
saw
and
recovered
his
wits
partially
shall
i
go
for
his
portmanteau
sir
stammered
he
making
a
shrewd
and
fortunate
guess
at
what
was
up
baker
assented
and
soon
after
went
out
to
get
the
horse
harnessed
on
this
archbold
pale
sorrowful
and
silent
hitherto
beckoned
alfred
into
the
back
kitchen
and
there
gave
him
his
watch
and
his
loose
money
i
took
care
of
them
for
you
said
she
for
the
like
have
often
been
stolen
in
this
place
put
the
money
in
your
shoes
it
may
be
useful
to
he
thanked
her
somewhat
sullenly
for
his
disappointment
was
so
deep
and
bitter
that
small
kindnesses
almost
irritated
him
she
sighed
it
is
cruel
to
be
angry
with
she
said
i
am
not
the
cause
of
this
it
is
a
heavier
blow
to
me
than
to
you
sooner
or
later
you
will
be
free
and
then
you
will
not
waste
a
thought
on
me
i
fear
but
i
must
remain
in
this
odious
prison
without
your
eyes
and
your
smile
to
lighten
me
yet
unable
to
forget
you
oh
alfred
for
sake
whisper
me
one
kind
word
at
parting
give
me
one
kind
look
to
remember
and
dote
she
put
out
both
hands
as
eloquently
as
she
spoke
and
overpowered
his
prudence
so
far
that
he
took
her
offered
hands
they
were
as
cold
now
as
they
were
burning
hot
the
last
time
and
pressed
them
and
said
i
shall
be
grateful
to
you
while
i
the
passionate
woman
snatched
her
hands
away
gratitude
is
too
cold
for
me
she
cried
i
scorn
even
yours
love
me
or
hate
he
made
no
reply
and
so
they
parted
will
you
pledge
your
honour
to
make
no
attempt
at
escape
on
the
road
asked
the
pawnbroker
on
his
return
i
see
you
d
d
first
replied
the
prisoner
on
this
he
was
handcuffed
and
helped
into
the
they
went
up
to
town
by
the
midnight
train
but
to
astonishment
and
delight
did
not
take
a
carriage
to
themselves
however
station
after
station
was
passed
and
nobody
came
into
their
carriage
at
last
they
stopped
at
a
larger
station
and
a
good
many
people
were
on
the
platform
alfred
took
this
opportunity
and
appealed
in
gentle
but
moving
terms
to
the
first
good
and
intelligent
face
he
saw
sir
said
he
i
implore
your
the
gentleman
turned
courteously
to
him
the
keepers
to
surprise
did
not
interrupt
i
am
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
sir
they
pretend
i
am
mad
and
are
taking
me
by
force
to
a
madhouse
a
living
you
certainly
do
appear
to
be
mad
said
the
gentleman
the
head
keeper
instantly
showed
him
the
order
and
a
copy
of
the
certificates
do
look
at
sir
cried
alfred
they
are
signed
by
men
who
were
bribed
to
sign
them
for
pity
sake
sir
judge
for
yourself
test
my
memory
my
judgment
by
any
question
you
please
use
your
own
good
sense
do
let
those
venal
rogues
judge
for
the
gentleman
turned
cold
directly
i
could
not
take
on
me
to
interfere
said
he
the
unsworn
affidavits
had
overpowered
his
senses
he
retired
with
a
frigid
inclination
alfred
wrung
his
handcuffed
hands
and
the
connecting
chain
rattled
the
men
never
complained
his
conduct
was
natural
and
they
knew
their
strength
at
the
next
station
he
tested
a
snob
humanity
instead
of
a
gentleman
he
had
heard
they
were
more
the
answer
was
a
broad
grin
repeated
at
intervals
being
called
mad
was
pretty
much
the
same
thing
as
being
mad
to
a
mind
of
this
class
and
alfred
had
admitted
he
was
called
mad
at
the
next
station
he
implored
a
old
gentleman
old
age
he
had
heard
has
known
griefs
and
learned
pity
the
keeper
showed
the
certificates
ah
said
senex
poor
young
man
now
do
agitate
yourself
it
is
all
for
your
good
pray
go
quietly
very
painful
very
and
he
hobbled
away
as
fast
as
he
could
it
is
by
shirking
the
painful
some
live
to
be
silvery
old
next
he
tried
a
policeman
bobby
listened
to
him
erect
as
a
dart
the
certificates
were
shown
him
he
eyed
them
and
said
sharply
all
nor
could
entreaties
and
appeals
to
common
sense
attract
a
word
or
even
a
look
from
him
alfred
cried
help
murder
if
you
are
englishmen
if
you
are
christians
help
this
soon
drew
a
crowd
round
him
listening
to
his
fiery
tale
of
wrong
and
crying
shame
shame
let
him
the
keepers
touched
their
heads
winked
and
got
out
and
showed
the
certificates
the
crowd
melted
away
like
wax
before
those
two
suns
of
evidence
unsworn
the
train
moved
on
it
was
appalling
how
could
he
ever
get
free
between
his
mind
and
that
of
his
fellows
there
lay
a
spiritual
barrier
more
impassible
than
the
walls
of
fortified
cities
yet
at
the
very
next
station
with
characteristic
tenacity
of
purpose
he
tried
again
for
he
saw
a
woman
standing
near
a
buxom
country
woman
of
forty
then
he
remembered
that
the
naked
eye
was
not
yet
an
extinct
institution
among
her
sex
he
told
her
his
tale
and
implored
her
to
use
her
own
eyes
she
seemed
struck
and
did
eye
him
far
more
closely
than
the
men
had
and
told
the
keepers
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
he
was
no
madman
for
she
had
seen
madmen
they
showed
her
the
certificates
oh
i
am
no
scholar
said
she
contemptuously
ye
ca
write
my
two
eyes
out
of
my
the
keeper
whipped
off
alfred
cap
and
showed
his
shaven
crown
la
so
he
is
said
she
lowering
her
tone
dear
heart
what
a
pity
and
such
a
pretty
young
and
after
that
all
he
could
say
only
drew
the
dew
of
patient
pity
to
her
eyes
the
train
went
on
and
left
her
standing
there
a
statue
of
negative
clemency
alfred
lost
heart
he
felt
how
impotent
he
was
i
shall
die
in
a
madhouse
he
said
he
shivered
in
a
corner
hating
man
and
doubting
god
they
reached
wycherley
early
in
the
morning
alfred
was
shown
into
a
nice
clean
bedroom
and
asked
whether
he
would
like
to
bathe
or
sleep
oh
a
bath
he
said
and
was
allowed
to
bathe
himself
he
had
not
been
long
in
the
water
when
wycherley
medical
assistant
tapped
at
the
door
and
then
entered
without
further
ceremony
a
young
gentleman
with
a
longish
down
on
his
chin
which
initiated
early
in
the
secrets
of
physiology
he
was
too
knowing
to
shave
off
and
so
go
to
meet
his
trouble
he
came
in
looking
like
a
machine
with
a
in
his
hand
and
stood
by
the
bath
side
dictating
notes
to
himself
and
jotting
them
down
six
contusions
two
on
the
thorax
one
on
the
abdomen
two
on
the
thighs
one
near
the
patella
turn
alfred
turned
in
the
water
a
slight
dorsal
abrasion
also
of
the
wrists
a
severe
excoriation
of
the
ankle
eh
iron
head
shaved
large
blister
good
any
other
injuries
external
or
internal
under
old
system
yes
sir
confined
as
a
madman
though
sane
as
i
am
sure
have
the
sense
to
oh
never
mind
that
we
are
all
sane
here
except
the
governor
and
he
whipped
out
and
entered
the
condition
of
the
new
patient
body
with
jealous
minuteness
in
the
as
for
his
mind
he
made
no
inquiry
into
that
indeed
he
was
little
qualified
for
researches
of
the
kind
at
breakfast
alfred
sat
with
a
number
of
mad
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
by
firmness
kindness
and
routine
had
been
led
into
excellent
habits
the
linen
was
clean
and
the
food
good
he
made
an
excellent
meal
and
set
about
escaping
with
this
view
he
explored
the
place
nobody
interfered
with
him
but
plenty
of
eyes
watched
him
the
house
was
on
the
system
he
soon
found
this
system
was
as
bad
for
him
as
it
was
good
for
the
insane
implied
a
great
many
attendants
and
constant
vigilance
moreover
the
doors
were
strong
the
windows
opened
only
eight
inches
and
that
from
the
top
their
framework
was
iron
painted
like
wood
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
get
into
the
yard
at
night
and
then
it
looked
quite
impossible
to
get
any
further
for
the
house
was
encompassed
by
high
walls
he
resigned
all
hope
of
escape
without
connivance
he
sounded
a
keeper
the
man
fired
at
the
first
word
come
none
of
that
sir
you
should
know
better
than
tempt
a
poor
alfred
coloured
to
the
eyes
and
sighed
deeply
to
have
honour
thrown
in
his
face
and
made
the
reason
for
not
aiding
him
to
baffle
a
dishonourable
conspiracy
but
he
took
the
reproof
so
sweetly
the
man
was
touched
and
seeing
him
deeply
dejected
said
do
be
down
on
your
luck
sir
if
you
are
really
better
which
you
do
look
to
have
much
the
matter
now
why
not
write
to
the
commissioners
and
ask
to
be
let
out
because
my
letters
will
be
ay
to
your
friends
but
not
to
the
commissioners
of
lunacy
not
in
this
house
any
god
bless
you
cried
alfred
impetuously
you
are
my
benefactor
you
are
an
honest
fellow
give
me
your
well
why
not
only
you
must
excite
yourself
take
it
formula
oh
no
cant
among
friends
said
alfred
would
you
be
excited
at
the
hope
of
getting
out
of
prison
well
i
do
know
but
i
might
bound
i
am
as
sick
of
it
as
you
alfred
got
paper
and
sketched
the
letter
on
which
so
much
depended
it
took
him
six
hours
he
tore
up
two
he
cooled
down
the
third
and
condensed
it
severely
by
this
means
after
much
thought
he
produced
a
close
and
telling
composition
he
also
weeded
it
of
every
trait
and
every
term
he
had
observed
in
mad
people
talk
or
the
letters
they
had
shown
him
so
there
was
no
incoherency
no
heat
no
prolixity
no
spies
no
conspiracy
no
italics
a
simple
honest
earnest
story
with
bitter
truth
stamped
on
every
line
a
sober
strong
appeal
from
a
sore
heart
but
hard
head
to
the
arbiters
of
his
fate
to
the
best
of
my
belief
no
madman
however
slightly
touched
or
however
cunning
ever
wrote
a
letter
so
gentle
yet
strong
so
earnest
yet
calm
so
short
yet
full
and
withal
so
lucid
and
cleanly
jointed
as
this
was
and
i
am
no
contemptible
judge
for
i
have
accumulated
during
the
last
few
years
a
large
collection
of
letters
from
persons
deranged
in
various
degrees
and
studied
them
minutely
more
minutely
than
most
psychologicals
study
anything
but
pounds
shillings
and
verbiage
the
letter
went
and
he
hoped
but
scarcely
expected
an
answer
by
return
of
post
it
did
not
come
he
said
to
his
heart
be
still
and
waited
another
day
went
by
and
another
he
gnawed
his
heart
and
waited
he
pined
and
waited
on
the
secret
tribunal
which
was
all
a
shallow
legislature
had
left
him
took
it
secret
tribunals
always
do
but
while
the
longed
and
pined
and
languished
for
one
sound
from
the
voice
of
justice
and
humanity
and
while
the
secret
tribunal
not
being
in
prison
itself
all
this
time
took
it
easy
events
occurred
at
barkington
that
bade
fair
to
throw
open
the
prison
doors
and
bring
father
and
son
bride
and
bridegroom
together
again
under
one
roof
but
at
what
a
price
chapter
xxxv
at
sight
of
sampson
placard
hardie
was
seized
with
a
tremor
that
suspended
the
razor
in
mid
air
he
opened
the
window
and
glared
at
the
doctor
notice
at
this
moment
he
himself
was
a
picture
not
unlike
those
half
cleaned
portraits
the
picture
restorers
hang
out
as
specimens
of
their
art
insolent
interfering
fool
he
muttered
and
began
to
walk
the
room
in
agitation
after
a
while
he
made
a
strong
effort
shaved
the
other
half
and
dressed
slowly
thinking
hard
all
the
time
the
result
was
he
went
out
before
breakfast
which
he
had
not
done
for
years
and
visited
baker
for
what
purpose
has
been
already
shown
on
his
return
jane
was
waiting
breakfast
the
first
word
to
him
was
papa
have
you
seen
what
the
reward
said
he
indifferently
yes
i
noticed
it
at
our
door
as
i
came
jane
said
it
was
a
very
improper
and
most
indelicate
interference
in
their
affairs
and
went
on
to
say
with
heightened
colour
i
have
just
told
peggy
to
take
it
down
not
for
the
world
cried
hardie
losing
all
his
calmness
real
or
feigned
and
he
rang
the
bell
hastily
on
peggy
appearing
he
said
anxiously
i
do
not
wish
that
notice
interfered
i
should
think
of
touching
it
without
your
order
sir
said
she
quietly
and
shot
him
a
feline
glance
from
under
her
pale
lashes
jane
coloured
and
looked
a
little
mortified
but
on
peggy
retiring
hardie
explained
that
whether
judicious
or
not
it
was
a
friendly
act
of
sampson
and
to
pull
down
his
notice
would
look
like
siding
with
the
boy
against
those
he
had
injured
besides
said
he
why
should
you
and
i
burk
inquiry
ill
as
he
has
used
me
i
am
his
father
and
not
altogether
without
anxiety
suppose
those
doctors
should
be
right
about
him
you
know
jane
had
for
some
time
been
longing
to
call
at
albion
villa
and
sympathise
with
her
friend
and
now
curiosity
was
superadded
she
burned
to
know
whether
the
dodds
knew
of
or
approved
this
placard
she
asked
her
father
whether
he
thought
she
could
go
there
with
propriety
why
not
said
he
cheerfully
and
with
assumed
carelessness
in
reality
it
was
essential
to
him
that
jane
should
visit
the
dodds
surrounded
by
pitfalls
threatened
with
a
new
and
mysterious
assailant
in
the
eccentric
but
keen
and
resolute
sampson
this
artful
man
who
had
now
become
a
very
machiavel
constant
danger
and
deceit
had
so
sharpened
and
deepened
his
great
natural
abilities
was
preparing
amongst
other
defences
a
shield
and
that
shield
was
a
sieve
and
that
sieve
was
his
daughter
in
fact
ever
since
his
return
he
had
acted
and
spoken
at
the
dodds
through
jane
but
with
a
masterly
appearance
of
simplicity
and
mere
confidential
intercourse
at
least
i
think
this
is
the
true
clue
to
all
his
recent
remarks
jane
a
truthful
unsuspicious
girl
was
all
the
fitter
instrument
of
the
cunning
monster
she
went
and
called
at
albion
villa
and
was
received
by
edward
dodd
being
upstairs
with
julia
and
in
five
minutes
she
had
told
him
what
her
father
she
owned
had
said
to
her
in
confidence
but
said
she
the
reason
i
repeat
these
things
is
to
make
peace
and
that
you
may
not
fancy
there
is
any
one
in
our
house
so
cruel
so
unchristian
as
to
approve
alfred
perfidy
oh
and
papa
said
candidly
he
disliked
the
match
but
then
he
disliked
this
way
of
ending
it
far
dodd
came
down
in
due
course
and
kissed
her
but
told
her
julia
could
not
see
even
her
at
present
i
think
dear
said
she
in
a
day
or
two
she
will
see
you
but
no
one
else
and
for
her
sake
we
shall
now
hurry
our
departure
from
this
place
where
she
was
once
so
dodd
did
not
like
to
begin
about
alfred
but
jane
had
no
such
scruples
she
inveighed
warmly
against
his
conduct
and
ere
she
left
the
house
had
quite
done
away
with
the
faint
suspicion
sampson
had
engendered
and
brought
both
dodd
and
edward
back
to
their
original
opinion
that
the
elder
hardie
had
nothing
on
earth
to
do
with
the
perfidy
of
the
younger
just
before
dinner
a
gentleman
called
on
edward
and
proved
to
be
a
policeman
in
plain
clothes
he
had
been
sent
from
the
office
to
sound
the
ostler
at
the
white
lion
and
if
necessary
to
threaten
him
the
police
knew
though
nobody
else
in
barkington
did
that
this
ostler
had
been
in
what
rogues
call
trouble
twice
and
as
the
police
can
starve
a
man
of
the
kind
by
blowing
on
him
and
can
reward
him
by
keeping
dark
he
knows
better
than
withhold
information
from
them
however
on
looking
for
this
ostler
he
had
left
his
place
that
very
morning
had
decamped
with
mysterious
suddenness
here
was
a
puzzle
had
the
man
gone
without
noticing
the
reward
had
somebody
outbid
the
reward
or
was
it
a
strange
coincidence
and
did
he
after
all
know
nothing
the
police
thought
it
was
no
coincidence
and
he
did
know
something
so
they
had
telegraphed
to
the
london
office
to
mark
him
down
edward
thanked
his
visitor
but
on
his
retiring
told
his
mother
he
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
and
she
only
said
we
seem
surrounded
by
meantime
unknown
to
these
bewildered
ones
greek
was
meeting
greek
only
a
few
yards
off
hardie
was
being
undermined
by
a
man
of
his
own
calibre
one
too
cautious
to
communicate
with
the
dodds
or
any
one
else
till
his
work
looked
ripe
the
game
began
thus
a
decent
mechanic
who
lodged
hard
by
lounging
with
his
pipe
near
the
gate
of
musgrove
cottage
offered
to
converse
with
old
betty
she
gave
him
a
rough
answer
but
with
a
touch
of
ineradicable
vanity
must
ask
peggy
if
she
wanted
a
sweetheart
because
there
was
a
hungry
one
at
the
gate
why
he
wanted
to
begin
on
an
old
woman
like
peggy
inquired
what
he
had
said
to
her
oh
he
begun
where
most
of
them
ends
if
they
get
so
far
at
all
axed
me
was
i
comfortable
here
if
not
he
knew
a
young
man
wanted
a
nice
tidy
body
to
keep
house
for
peggy
pricked
up
her
ears
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
went
for
a
box
of
lucifers
in
a
new
bonnet
and
clean
collar
she
tripped
past
the
able
mechanic
very
accidentally
and
he
bestowed
an
admiring
smile
on
her
but
said
nothing
only
smoked
however
on
her
return
he
contrived
to
detain
her
and
paid
her
a
good
many
compliments
which
she
took
laughingly
and
with
no
great
appearance
of
believing
them
however
there
is
no
going
by
that
compliments
sink
and
within
hours
the
able
mechanic
had
become
a
hot
wooer
of
peggy
black
always
on
the
for
her
day
and
night
and
telling
her
all
about
the
lump
of
money
he
had
saved
and
how
he
could
double
his
income
if
he
had
but
a
counter
and
tidy
wife
behind
it
peggy
gossiped
in
turn
and
let
out
amongst
the
rest
that
she
had
been
turned
off
once
just
for
answering
a
little
sharply
and
now
it
was
the
other
way
her
master
was
a
trifle
too
civil
at
times
who
could
help
it
said
the
able
mechanic
rapturously
and
offered
a
pressing
civility
which
peggy
fought
off
not
so
free
young
man
said
she
kissing
is
the
prologue
to
how
do
you
know
that
inquired
the
able
mechanic
with
the
sly
humour
of
his
class
it
is
a
saying
replied
peggy
demurely
at
last
one
night
green
the
detective
for
he
it
was
put
his
arm
round
his
new
sweetheart
waist
and
approached
the
subject
nearest
his
heart
he
told
her
he
had
just
found
out
there
was
money
enough
to
be
made
in
one
day
to
set
them
up
for
life
in
a
nice
little
shop
and
she
could
help
in
it
after
this
inviting
preamble
he
crept
towards
the
by
artful
questions
and
soon
elicited
that
there
had
been
high
words
between
master
and
alfred
about
that
very
sum
she
had
listened
at
the
door
and
heard
taking
care
to
combine
close
courtship
with
cunning
interrogatories
he
was
soon
enabled
to
write
to
sampson
and
say
that
a
servant
of
hardie
was
down
on
him
and
reported
that
he
carried
a
large
in
his
by
day
and
she
had
found
the
dent
of
it
under
his
pillow
at
night
a
stroke
of
observation
very
creditable
in
an
unprofessional
female
on
this
he
had
made
it
his
business
to
meet
hardie
in
broad
day
and
sure
enough
the
was
always
there
he
added
that
the
said
hardie
face
wore
an
expression
which
he
had
seen
more
than
once
when
respectable
parties
went
in
for
felony
and
altogether
thought
they
might
now
take
out
a
warrant
and
proceed
in
the
regular
way
sampson
received
this
news
with
great
satisfaction
but
was
crippled
by
the
interwoven
relations
of
the
parties
to
arrest
hardie
on
a
warrant
would
entail
a
prosecution
for
felony
and
separate
jane
and
edward
for
ever
he
telegraphed
green
to
meet
him
at
the
station
and
reached
barkington
at
eight
that
very
evening
green
and
he
proceeded
to
albion
villa
and
there
they
held
a
long
and
earnest
consultation
with
edward
and
at
last
on
certain
conditions
green
and
edward
consented
to
act
on
sampson
plan
green
by
this
time
knew
all
hardie
habits
and
assured
them
that
at
ten
he
would
walk
up
and
down
the
road
for
at
least
half
an
hour
the
night
being
dry
it
wanted
about
a
quarter
to
ten
when
dodd
came
down
and
proposed
supper
to
the
travellers
sampson
declined
it
for
the
present
and
said
they
had
work
to
do
at
eleven
then
making
the
others
a
signal
not
to
disclose
anything
at
present
he
drew
her
aside
and
asked
after
julia
dodd
sighed
she
goes
from
one
thing
to
another
but
always
returns
to
one
idea
that
he
is
a
victim
not
a
well
tell
her
in
one
hour
the
money
shall
be
in
the
the
money
what
does
she
care
well
say
we
shall
know
all
about
alfred
by
eleven
my
dear
friend
be
prudent
said
dodd
i
feel
alarmed
you
were
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
when
i
came
y
are
very
obsairvant
but
dawnt
be
uneasy
we
are
three
to
one
just
go
and
comfort
miss
julee
with
my
ah
that
i
will
she
said
she
was
no
sooner
gone
than
they
all
stole
out
into
the
night
and
a
pitch
dark
night
it
was
but
green
had
a
powerful
dark
lantern
to
use
if
necessary
they
waited
green
at
the
gate
of
musgrove
cottage
the
other
two
a
little
way
up
the
road
ten
struck
some
minutes
passed
without
the
expected
signal
from
green
and
edward
and
sampson
began
to
shiver
for
it
was
very
cold
and
dark
and
in
the
next
place
they
were
honest
men
going
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hands
and
the
law
sometimes
calls
that
breaking
the
law
confound
him
muttered
sampson
if
he
does
not
soon
come
i
shall
run
away
it
is
bitterly
presently
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
but
no
signal
it
proved
to
be
only
a
fellow
in
a
rolling
home
from
the
just
as
his
footsteps
died
away
a
low
hoot
like
a
plaintive
owl
was
heard
and
they
knew
their
game
was
afoot
presently
tramp
tramp
came
the
slow
and
stately
march
of
him
they
had
hunted
down
he
came
very
slowly
like
one
lost
in
meditation
and
these
amateur
policemen
hearts
beat
louder
and
louder
as
he
drew
nearer
and
nearer
at
last
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
a
shadowy
outline
was
visible
another
tramp
or
two
it
was
upon
them
now
the
cautious
green
had
stipulated
that
the
pocketbook
should
first
be
felt
for
and
if
not
there
the
matter
should
go
no
farther
so
edward
made
a
stumble
and
fell
against
hardie
and
felt
his
left
breast
the
was
there
yes
he
whispered
and
hardie
in
the
act
of
remonstrating
at
his
clumsiness
was
pinned
behind
and
his
arms
strapped
with
wonderful
rapidity
and
dexterity
then
first
he
seemed
to
awake
to
his
hunger
and
uttered
a
stentorian
cry
of
terror
that
rang
through
the
night
and
made
two
of
his
three
captors
tremble
cut
that
said
green
sternly
or
you
get
into
hardie
lowered
his
voice
directly
do
not
kill
me
do
not
hurt
me
he
murmured
i
am
but
a
poor
man
now
take
my
little
money
it
is
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
but
spare
my
life
you
see
i
do
come
stash
your
gab
my
lad
said
green
contemptuously
addressing
him
just
as
he
would
any
other
of
the
birds
he
was
accustomed
to
capture
it
not
your
stiff
that
is
wanted
but
captain
captain
dodd
cried
the
prisoner
with
a
wonderful
assumption
of
innocence
ay
the
said
green
here
this
this
he
tapped
on
the
and
instantly
the
prisoner
uttered
a
cry
of
agony
and
sprang
into
the
road
with
an
agility
no
one
would
have
thought
possible
but
edward
and
green
soon
caught
him
and
the
doctor
joining
they
held
him
and
green
tore
his
coat
open
the
was
not
there
he
tore
open
his
waistcoat
it
was
not
in
the
waistcoat
but
it
was
sewed
to
his
very
shirt
on
the
outside
green
wrenched
it
away
and
bidding
the
other
two
go
behind
the
prisoner
and
look
over
his
shoulder
unseen
themselves
slipped
the
shade
of
his
lantern
hardie
had
now
ceased
to
struggle
and
to
exclaim
he
stood
sullen
mute
desperate
while
an
agitated
face
peered
eagerly
over
each
of
his
shoulders
at
the
open
in
green
hands
on
which
the
lantern
now
poured
a
narrow
but
vivid
stream
of
light
chapter
xxxvi
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
so
green
emptied
the
pocketbook
into
his
hat
and
sifted
the
contents
in
a
turn
of
the
hand
announcing
each
discovery
in
a
whisper
to
his
excited
and
peering
associates
a
lot
of
of
no
use
to
any
one
but
me
said
the
prisoner
earnestly
two
miniatures
gold
rims
pinchbeck
they
are
portraits
of
my
children
when
young
heaven
forgive
me
i
could
not
give
them
up
to
my
creditors
surely
surely
you
will
not
rob
me
of
stash
your
gab
said
green
roughly
here
a
guinea
queen
it
belonged
to
my
take
it
but
you
will
let
me
redeem
it
i
will
give
for
it
poor
as
i
am
you
can
leave
it
on
my
and
i
leave
the
stow
your
gab
letters
papers
covered
with
figures
stay
what
is
this
a
lot
of
they
are
of
the
most
private
and
delicate
character
pray
do
not
expose
my
family
and
hardie
who
of
late
had
been
gathering
composure
showed
some
signs
of
agitation
the
two
figures
glaring
over
his
shoulder
shared
it
and
his
remonstrance
only
made
green
examine
the
papers
keenly
they
might
contain
some
clue
to
the
missing
money
it
proved
a
miscellaneous
record
the
price
of
stocks
at
various
days
notes
of
the
official
assignee
remarks
in
going
over
the
books
at
last
however
green
quick
eye
fell
upon
a
fainter
entry
in
pencil
figures
yes
actually
all
right
he
said
and
took
the
paper
close
to
the
lantern
and
began
to
spell
it
out
day
alfred
told
me
to
my
face
i
had
of
captain
dodd
we
had
an
angry
discussion
what
can
he
mean
drs
wycherley
and
osmond
this
same
day
afflicted
me
with
hints
that
he
is
deranged
or
partly
i
saw
no
signs
of
it
before
wrote
to
my
brother
entreating
him
to
give
me
to
replace
the
sum
which
i
really
have
wronged
this
respectable
and
now
most
afflicted
family
of
i
had
better
withdraw
here
hardie
interrupted
him
with
sorrowful
dignity
these
are
mere
family
matters
if
you
are
a
man
respect
green
went
reading
on
like
fate
withdraw
my
opposition
to
the
marriage
or
else
it
seems
my
own
flesh
and
blood
will
go
about
the
place
blackening
my
reputation
hardie
stamped
on
the
ground
i
tell
you
on
my
honour
as
a
gentleman
there
no
money
there
but
my
grandfather
guinea
my
money
is
all
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
where
you
a
flutter
of
uneasiness
seemed
to
come
over
the
detective
he
darkened
his
lantern
and
replaced
the
hurriedly
in
the
breast
felt
him
all
over
in
a
minute
and
to
keep
up
the
farce
robbed
him
only
eight
yellow
boys
said
he
contemptuously
to
his
mates
he
then
shipped
the
money
back
into
hardie
and
conducted
him
to
his
own
gate
tied
him
to
it
by
the
waist
and
ordered
him
not
to
give
the
alarm
for
ten
minutes
on
pain
of
death
i
consent
said
hardie
and
thank
you
for
abstaining
from
all
right
my
tulip
said
green
cheerfully
and
drew
his
companions
quietly
away
but
the
next
moment
he
began
to
run
and
making
a
sudden
turn
dived
into
a
street
then
into
a
passage
and
so
winded
and
doubled
till
he
got
to
a
small
he
used
some
flash
word
and
they
were
shown
a
private
room
wait
here
an
hour
for
me
he
whispered
i
must
see
who
liberates
him
and
whether
he
is
really
as
innocent
as
he
reads
or
we
have
been
countermined
by
the
devil
own
the
unexpected
turn
the
evidence
had
taken
evidence
of
their
own
choosing
too
cleared
hardie
with
the
unprofessionals
edward
embraced
this
conclusion
as
a
matter
of
course
and
urged
the
character
of
that
gentleman
solitary
traducer
alfred
was
a
traitor
and
therefore
why
not
a
slanderer
even
sampson
on
the
whole
inclined
to
a
similar
conclusion
at
this
crisis
of
the
discussion
a
pedlar
with
very
large
whiskers
and
the
remains
of
a
black
eye
put
his
head
in
and
asked
whether
tom
green
was
there
no
said
the
doctor
stoutly
not
desiring
company
of
this
stamp
do
know
the
the
pedlar
laughed
there
is
not
many
that
do
know
him
at
all
hours
however
he
here
and
he
whipped
off
the
red
hair
and
wiped
off
the
black
eye
and
ho
green
he
received
their
compliments
on
his
protean
powers
and
told
them
he
had
been
just
a
minute
too
late
hardie
was
gone
and
so
he
had
lost
the
chance
of
seeing
who
came
to
help
him
and
of
hearing
the
first
words
that
passed
between
the
two
this
he
said
was
a
very
great
pity
for
it
would
have
shown
him
in
one
moment
whether
certain
suspicions
of
his
were
correct
pressed
as
to
what
these
suspicions
were
he
begged
to
be
excused
saying
any
more
for
the
present
the
doctor
however
would
not
let
him
off
so
but
insisted
on
his
candid
opinion
well
sir
said
green
i
never
was
more
puzzled
in
my
life
owing
to
not
being
near
hand
when
he
was
untied
it
looks
all
square
however
there
one
little
thing
that
do
fit
they
both
asked
in
a
breath
what
that
was
the
sovs
were
all
they
asked
how
he
knew
and
had
he
got
them
in
his
pocket
to
show
green
uttered
a
low
chuckling
laugh
what
me
fake
the
beans
now
i
live
on
this
side
of
the
hedge
never
knew
a
cove
mix
his
liquors
that
way
but
it
hurt
his
health
soon
or
late
no
i
took
them
out
of
one
pocket
and
felt
of
them
as
i
slipped
them
into
the
other
ye
see
gents
to
do
any
good
on
my
lay
a
man
must
train
his
senses
as
well
as
his
mind
he
must
have
a
hare
ear
and
a
hawk
eye
a
bloodhound
nose
and
a
lady
hand
with
steel
fingers
and
a
silk
skin
now
look
at
that
bunch
of
fives
continued
the
master
and
laid
a
hand
white
and
soft
as
a
duchess
on
the
table
it
can
put
the
bracelets
on
a
giant
or
find
a
sharper
on
the
back
of
the
knave
of
clubs
the
beans
were
marked
which
it
is
a
small
thing
but
it
do
fit
the
rest
here
an
unsuspicious
gent
took
by
surprise
in
moonlight
meditation
fancy
free
and
all
his
little
private
family
matters
found
in
his
innocent
bosom
quite
promiscuous
but
his
beans
marked
that
do
dovetail
nohow
gents
did
ever
you
hear
of
the
man
that
went
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottomless
pit
to
ease
his
mind
well
he
was
the
head
of
my
family
i
must
go
to
the
bottom
whether
there
one
or
not
and
just
now
i
see
but
one
and
what
is
that
inquired
both
his
companions
in
some
alarm
oh
i
must
threaten
it
said
green
or
i
shall
never
have
the
stomach
to
do
it
but
dear
me
this
boozing
ken
is
a
very
unfit
place
for
you
you
are
not
dog
nose
ones
now
you
part
and
make
tracks
for
home
one
on
foot
and
one
in
a
fly
you
wo
see
me
nor
hear
of
me
again
till
i
something
and
so
the
confederates
parted
and
sampson
and
edward
met
at
albion
villa
and
edward
told
his
mother
what
they
had
done
and
his
conviction
that
hardie
was
innocent
and
alfred
a
slanderer
as
well
as
a
traitor
and
indeed
said
he
if
we
had
but
stopped
to
reflect
we
should
have
seen
how
unlikely
the
money
was
not
to
be
lost
in
the
why
the
says
she
went
to
pieces
almost
directly
she
struck
what
we
ought
to
have
done
was
not
to
listen
to
alfred
hardie
like
fools
but
write
to
lloyd
like
people
in
their
senses
i
do
it
this
minute
and
find
out
the
surviving
officers
of
the
ship
they
will
be
able
to
give
us
information
on
that
dodd
approved
and
said
she
would
write
to
her
kind
correspondent
beresford
and
she
did
sit
down
to
her
desk
at
once
as
for
sampson
he
returned
to
town
next
morning
not
quite
convinced
but
thoroughly
staggered
and
determined
for
once
to
resign
his
own
judgment
and
abide
the
result
of
dodd
correspondence
and
green
sagacity
all
he
insisted
on
was
that
his
placard
about
alfred
should
be
continued
he
left
money
for
this
and
edward
against
the
grain
consented
to
see
it
done
but
placards
are
no
monopoly
in
the
afternoon
only
a
section
of
was
visible
in
most
parts
of
the
town
by
reason
of
a
poster
to
this
effect
pasted
half
over
it
fifty
guineas
reward
whereas
yesterday
evening
at
ten
richard
hardie
of
musgrove
cottage
barkington
was
assaulted
at
his
own
door
by
three
ruffians
who
rifled
his
pockets
and
read
his
private
memoranda
and
committed
other
acts
of
violence
the
shock
of
which
has
laid
him
on
a
bed
of
sickness
the
above
reward
shall
be
paid
to
any
person
or
persons
who
will
give
such
information
as
shall
lead
to
the
detection
of
all
or
any
one
of
the
miscreants
concerned
in
this
outrage
the
above
reward
will
be
paid
by
thomas
hardie
of
clare
court
on
this
the
impartial
police
came
to
hardie
and
made
inquiries
he
received
them
in
bed
and
told
them
particulars
and
they
gathered
from
peggy
that
she
had
heard
a
cry
of
distress
and
opened
the
kitchen
door
and
that
betty
and
she
had
ventured
out
together
and
found
poor
master
tied
to
the
gate
with
an
old
cord
this
she
produced
and
the
police
inspected
and
took
it
away
with
them
at
sight
of
that
notice
edward
felt
cold
and
then
hot
and
realised
the
false
and
perilous
position
into
which
he
had
been
betrayed
so
much
for
being
wiser
than
the
law
he
said
what
are
we
now
but
three
footpads
this
and
the
insult
his
sister
had
received
made
the
place
poison
to
him
and
hastened
their
departure
by
a
day
or
two
the
very
next
day
thursday
an
on
the
walls
of
albion
villa
announced
that
chippenham
auctioneer
would
sell
next
wednesday
on
the
premises
the
greater
part
of
the
furniture
plate
china
glass
oriental
inlaid
boxes
and
screens
with
several
superb
india
shawls
scarfs
and
dresses
also
a
years
lease
of
the
villa
seventeen
to
run
edward
took
unfurnished
apartments
in
london
near
russell
square
a
locality
in
which
as
he
learned
from
the
the
rooms
were
large
and
cheap
he
packed
just
so
much
furniture
as
was
essential
no
it
was
to
go
by
rail
on
monday
dodd
and
julia
were
to
follow
on
tuesday
edward
to
stay
at
barkington
and
look
after
the
sale
meantime
their
secret
ally
green
was
preparing
his
threatened
the
more
he
reflected
the
more
he
suspected
that
he
had
been
outwitted
by
peggy
black
she
had
led
him
on
and
the
had
been
planted
for
him
if
so
why
peggy
was
a
genius
and
in
his
own
line
and
he
would
marry
her
and
so
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
make
a
detective
of
her
there
was
a
sad
lack
of
female
detectives
and
once
his
wife
she
would
split
on
her
master
and
he
should
defeat
that
old
soldier
at
last
and
get
a
handsome
slice
of
the
he
manoeuvred
thus
first
he
went
back
to
london
for
a
day
or
two
to
do
other
jobs
and
to
let
this
matter
cool
then
he
returned
and
wrote
from
a
town
near
barkington
to
peggy
black
telling
her
he
had
been
sent
away
suddenly
on
a
job
but
his
heart
had
remained
behind
with
his
peggy
would
she
meet
him
at
the
gate
at
nine
that
evening
he
had
something
very
particular
to
say
to
her
as
to
the
nature
of
the
business
the
enclosed
would
give
her
a
hint
she
might
name
her
own
day
and
the
sooner
the
better
the
enclosed
was
a
at
nine
this
extraordinary
pair
of
lovers
met
at
the
gate
but
peggy
seemed
hardly
at
her
ease
said
her
master
would
be
coming
out
and
catching
her
perhaps
they
had
better
walk
up
the
road
a
bit
with
all
my
heart
said
green
but
he
could
not
help
a
little
sneer
your
master
said
he
why
he
is
your
servant
as
i
am
what
is
he
jealous
i
do
know
what
you
mean
young
man
said
peggy
i
tell
you
when
we
are
la
that
is
a
long
time
to
wait
for
my
answer
why
we
ai
asked
in
church
there
no
need
of
that
i
can
afford
a
special
lawk
a
daisy
why
you
be
a
gentleman
no
but
i
can
keep
my
wife
like
a
you
sounds
very
tempting
murmured
peggy
throwing
her
skirt
over
her
head
for
a
drizzle
was
beginning
and
walking
slower
and
slower
then
he
made
hot
love
to
her
and
pressed
her
hard
to
name
the
day
she
coquetted
with
the
question
till
they
came
near
the
mouth
of
a
dark
lane
called
lovers
walk
then
as
he
insisted
on
an
answer
she
hung
her
head
bashfully
and
coughed
a
little
cough
at
which
preconcerted
signal
a
huge
policeman
sprang
out
of
the
lane
and
collared
green
on
this
peggy
who
was
all
lie
from
head
to
heel
uttered
a
little
scream
of
dismay
and
surprise
green
laughed
well
you
a
downy
one
said
he
i
marry
you
all
the
more
for
the
detective
put
his
hands
suddenly
inside
the
policeman
caught
him
by
the
bosom
with
his
right
hand
by
way
of
fulcrum
and
with
his
left
by
the
chin
which
he
forced
violently
back
and
gave
him
a
slight
cornish
trip
at
the
same
moment
down
went
the
policeman
on
the
back
of
his
head
a
fearful
crack
green
then
caught
the
astonished
peggy
round
the
neck
kissed
her
lips
violently
and
fled
like
the
wind
removed
all
traces
of
his
personal
identity
and
up
to
london
by
the
train
in
the
character
of
a
young
swell
with
a
eyeglass
and
a
long
moustache
the
colour
of
his
tender
mistress
eyebrow
tow
from
town
he
wrote
to
her
made
her
a
formal
offer
of
marriage
and
gave
her
an
address
to
write
to
should
she
at
any
time
think
more
kindly
of
him
and
of
his
sincere
i
suppose
he
specified
sincere
because
it
was
no
longer
sincere
he
hurled
the
offer
into
musgrove
cottage
by
way
of
an
apple
of
discord
at
least
so
i
infer
from
the
memorandum
with
which
he
retired
at
present
from
the
cash
hunt
mr
hardie
has
the
stiff
i
think
but
if
so
it
is
planted
somewhere
does
carry
it
about
him
my
peggy
is
his
mistress
nothing
to
be
done
till
they
victorious
so
far
hardie
had
still
one
pressing
anxiety
sampson
placard
this
had
been
renewed
and
stared
him
everywhere
in
the
face
every
copy
of
it
he
encountered
made
him
shiver
if
he
had
been
a
man
of
impulse
he
would
have
torn
it
down
wherever
he
saw
it
but
he
knew
that
would
not
do
however
learning
from
jane
who
had
it
from
old
betty
who
had
it
from
sarah
that
and
miss
dodd
would
leave
for
london
the
day
before
the
sale
and
edward
the
day
after
it
he
thought
he
might
venture
in
the
busy
intermediate
time
to
take
some
liberties
with
it
this
he
did
with
excellent
tact
and
judgment
peggy
and
a
billsticker
were
seen
in
conference
and
soon
after
the
huge
bills
of
a
travelling
circus
were
pasted
right
over
both
the
rival
advertisements
in
which
the
name
of
hardie
figured
the
consequence
was
edward
raised
no
objection
he
was
full
of
the
sale
for
one
thing
but
i
suspect
he
was
content
to
see
his
own
false
move
pasted
over
on
such
easy
terms
one
morning
peggy
brought
in
the
letters
and
jane
saw
one
in
handwriting
she
snatched
it
up
and
cried
papa
from
alfred
and
she
left
off
making
the
tea
while
her
father
opened
it
with
comparative
composure
this
coolness
however
did
not
outlast
the
perusal
the
young
ruffian
said
he
would
you
believe
it
jenny
he
accuses
me
of
being
the
cause
of
his
last
let
me
see
he
held
her
out
the
letter
but
hesitated
and
drew
it
back
my
dear
it
would
give
you
pain
to
see
your
poor
father
treated
so
here
a
specimen
could
they
expect
but
that
the
son
of
a
sharper
would
prove
a
traitor
you
stole
her
money
i
her
affections
of
which
i
am
unworthy
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
unhappy
alfred
said
jane
no
papa
i
would
not
read
it
if
you
are
insulted
in
it
but
where
is
he
the
letter
is
dated
paris
see
and
he
showed
her
the
date
but
he
says
here
he
is
coming
back
to
london
directly
and
he
orders
me
in
the
most
peremptory
way
to
be
ready
with
my
accounts
and
pay
him
over
his
fortune
well
he
is
alive
at
all
events
really
my
good
kind
interfering
pragmatical
friend
sampson
with
his
placards
made
me
feel
uneasy
more
uneasy
than
i
would
own
to
you
unhappy
alfred
cried
jane
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
and
poor
papa
oh
never
mind
me
said
hardie
now
that
i
know
no
harm
has
come
to
him
i
really
do
care
a
straw
i
have
got
one
child
that
loves
me
and
that
i
ah
yes
dear
dear
papa
and
that
will
always
love
you
and
never
never
disobey
you
in
small
things
or
she
rose
from
the
table
and
sealed
this
with
a
pious
kiss
and
when
she
sat
down
with
a
pink
flush
on
her
delicate
cheek
his
hard
eye
melted
and
dwelt
on
her
with
beaming
tenderness
his
heart
yearned
over
her
and
a
pang
went
through
it
to
think
that
he
must
deceive
even
her
the
one
sweet
soul
that
loved
him
it
was
a
passing
remorse
the
successful
plotter
soon
predominated
and
it
was
with
unmixed
satisfaction
he
saw
her
put
on
her
bonnet
directly
after
breakfast
and
hurry
off
to
albion
villa
to
play
the
part
of
his
unconscious
sieve
he
himself
strolled
in
the
opposite
direction
not
to
seem
to
be
watching
her
he
was
in
good
spirits
felt
like
a
general
who
after
repulsing
many
desperate
attacks
successfully
orders
an
advance
and
sees
the
tide
of
battle
roll
away
from
his
bayonets
his
very
body
seemed
elastic
indomitable
he
walked
lustily
out
into
the
country
sniffed
the
perfumed
hedges
and
relished
life
to
be
sure
he
could
not
walk
away
from
all
traces
of
his
misdeeds
he
fell
in
with
objects
that
to
an
ordinary
sinner
might
have
spoiled
the
walk
and
even
marred
the
he
found
his
creditor
maxley
with
grizzly
beard
and
bloodshot
eyes
belabouring
a
milestone
and
two
small
boys
quizzing
him
and
pelting
him
with
mud
and
soon
after
he
met
his
creditor
old
phillips
in
a
cart
coming
back
to
barkington
to
end
his
days
there
at
the
almshouse
but
to
our
triumphant
bankrupt
and
machiavel
these
things
were
literally
nothing
he
paced
complacently
on
and
cared
no
more
for
either
of
those
his
wrecks
than
the
smiling
sea
itself
seems
to
care
for
the
dead
ships
and
men
it
washed
ashore
a
week
ago
he
came
home
before
luncheon
for
his
gossip
with
jane
but
she
had
not
returned
all
the
better
her
budget
would
be
the
larger
to
while
the
time
he
got
his
file
of
the
and
amused
himself
noting
down
the
fluctuations
in
peruvian
bonds
while
thus
employed
he
heard
a
loud
knock
at
his
door
and
soon
after
peggy
voice
and
a
man
in
swift
collision
hasty
feet
came
along
the
passage
the
parlour
door
opened
and
a
young
man
rushed
in
pale
as
ashes
and
stared
at
him
he
was
breathless
and
his
lips
moved
but
no
sound
came
it
was
edward
dodd
hardie
rose
like
a
tower
and
manned
himself
to
repulse
this
fresh
assault
the
strange
visitor
gasped
out
you
are
wanted
at
our
chapter
xxxvii
jane
hardie
had
found
albion
villa
in
the
miserable
state
that
precedes
an
auction
the
house
raw
its
contents
the
stair
carpets
and
carpets
were
up
and
in
rolls
in
the
the
bulk
of
the
furniture
was
there
too
the
auction
was
to
be
in
that
room
the
hall
was
clogged
with
great
packages
and
littered
with
small
all
awaiting
the
railway
carts
and
edward
dusty
and
deliquescent
was
cording
strapping
and
nailing
them
at
the
gallop
in
his
shirt
sleeves
jane
heart
sank
at
the
visible
signs
of
his
departure
she
sighed
and
then
partly
to
divert
his
attention
told
him
hastily
there
was
a
letter
from
alfred
on
this
he
ran
upstairs
and
told
dodd
and
she
came
downstairs
and
after
a
conversation
took
jane
up
softly
to
her
friend
room
they
opened
the
door
gently
and
jane
saw
the
grief
she
was
come
to
console
or
to
embitter
such
a
change
instead
of
the
bright
elastic
impetuous
young
beauty
there
sat
a
pale
languid
girl
with
weary
of
the
world
written
on
every
part
of
her
eloquent
body
her
right
hand
dangled
by
her
side
and
on
the
ground
beneath
it
lay
a
piece
of
work
she
had
been
attempting
but
it
had
escaped
from
those
listless
fingers
her
left
arm
was
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
table
with
an
unspeakable
abandon
and
her
brow
laid
wearily
on
it
above
the
elbow
so
lies
the
wounded
bird
so
droops
the
broken
lily
she
did
not
move
for
jane
light
foot
she
often
sat
thus
a
drooping
statue
and
let
the
people
come
and
go
unheeded
jane
heart
yearned
for
her
she
came
softly
and
laid
a
little
hand
lightly
on
her
shoulder
and
true
to
her
creed
that
we
must
look
upward
for
consolation
said
in
her
ear
and
in
solemn
silvery
tones
our
light
affliction
which
is
but
for
a
moment
worketh
for
us
a
far
more
exceeding
and
eternal
weight
of
julia
turned
at
this
and
flung
her
arms
round
jane
neck
and
panted
heavily
jane
kissed
her
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
proceeded
to
pour
out
from
a
memory
richly
stored
with
scripture
those
blessed
words
it
is
full
of
words
that
in
our
hours
of
ease
or
biblical
criticism
pass
over
the
mind
like
some
drowsy
chime
but
in
the
bitter
day
of
anguish
and
bereavement
when
the
body
is
racked
the
soul
darkened
shine
out
like
stars
to
the
mariner
seem
then
first
to
swell
to
their
real
size
and
meaning
and
come
to
writhing
mortals
like
pitying
seraphim
divinity
on
their
faces
and
healing
on
their
wings
julia
sighed
heavily
ah
she
said
these
are
sweet
words
but
i
am
not
ripe
for
them
you
show
me
the
true
path
of
happiness
but
i
to
be
happy
it
i
want
to
be
happy
if
the
angels
came
for
me
and
took
me
to
heaven
this
moment
i
should
be
miserable
there
if
i
thought
was
in
eternal
torment
ay
i
should
be
as
miserable
there
as
i
am
here
oh
jane
when
god
means
to
comfort
me
he
will
show
me
is
alive
till
then
words
are
wasted
on
me
even
bible
tell
her
your
news
my
dear
said
dodd
quietly
she
was
one
of
those
who
take
human
nature
as
it
is
and
make
the
best
of
it
julia
dear
said
jane
your
fears
are
extravagant
indeed
alfred
is
alive
we
julia
trembled
but
said
nothing
he
has
written
ah
to
you
no
to
i
do
believe
it
why
to
him
but
i
saw
the
letter
dear
i
had
it
my
did
you
read
it
asked
julia
trembling
now
like
an
aspen
and
fluttering
like
a
bird
no
but
i
read
the
address
and
the
date
inside
and
i
saw
the
handwriting
and
i
was
offered
the
letter
but
papa
told
me
it
was
full
of
abuse
of
him
so
i
to
read
it
however
i
will
get
it
for
this
was
one
of
those
involuntary
inaccuracies
which
creep
into
mortal
statements
dodd
thanked
her
warmly
but
asked
her
if
she
could
not
in
the
meantime
give
some
idea
of
the
contents
oh
yes
dodd
papa
read
me
out
a
great
deal
of
it
he
was
in
paris
but
just
starting
for
london
and
he
demanded
his
money
and
his
accounts
you
know
papa
is
one
of
his
well
but
said
dodd
there
was
nothing
nothing
about
oh
yes
there
was
said
jane
only
i
well
then
for
dear
sake
the
letter
said
wonder
the
son
of
a
sharper
should
prove
a
traitor
have
stolen
her
money
and
her
affections
and
oh
i
ca
i
and
jane
hardie
began
to
cry
dodd
embraced
her
like
a
mother
and
entered
into
her
filial
feelings
dodd
had
never
seen
her
so
weak
and
therefore
never
thought
her
so
amiable
thus
occupied
they
did
not
at
first
observe
how
these
tidings
were
changing
julia
but
presently
looking
up
they
saw
her
standing
at
her
full
height
on
fire
with
wrath
and
insulted
pride
ah
you
have
brought
me
comfort
she
cried
mamma
i
shall
hate
and
scorn
this
man
some
day
as
much
as
i
hate
and
scorn
myself
now
for
every
tear
i
have
shed
for
they
tried
to
calm
her
but
in
vain
a
new
gust
of
passion
possessed
the
ardent
young
creature
and
would
have
vent
she
reddened
from
bosom
to
brow
and
the
scalding
tears
ran
down
her
flaming
cheeks
and
she
repeated
between
her
clenched
teeth
my
veins
are
not
filled
with
i
can
tell
you
you
have
seen
how
i
can
love
you
shall
see
how
i
can
and
with
this
she
went
haughtily
out
of
the
room
not
to
expose
the
passion
which
overpowered
her
dodd
took
advantage
of
her
absence
to
thank
jane
for
her
kindness
and
told
her
she
had
also
received
some
letters
by
this
morning
post
and
thought
it
would
be
neither
kind
on
her
part
nor
just
to
conceal
their
purport
from
her
she
then
read
her
a
letter
from
beresford
and
another
from
grey
in
answer
to
queries
about
the
sharpe
i
may
as
well
observe
was
at
sea
bayliss
drowned
beresford
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
grey
was
positive
captain
dodd
when
in
command
had
several
thousand
pounds
in
his
cabin
beresford
indian
servant
had
been
detected
trying
to
steal
it
and
put
in
irons
believed
the
lady
had
not
been
told
the
cause
out
of
delicacy
and
captain
roberts
had
liberated
him
as
to
whether
the
money
had
escaped
the
wreck
if
on
captain
person
it
might
have
been
saved
but
if
not
it
was
certainly
lost
for
captain
dodd
to
his
knowledge
had
run
on
deck
from
the
passenger
cabin
the
moment
the
ship
struck
and
had
remained
there
till
she
went
to
pieces
and
everything
was
washed
out
of
her
our
own
opinion
said
dodd
i
mean
edward
and
mine
is
now
that
the
money
was
lost
in
the
ship
and
you
can
tell
your
papa
so
if
you
jane
thanked
her
and
said
she
thought
so
too
and
what
a
sad
thing
it
was
soon
after
this
julia
returned
pale
and
calm
as
a
statue
and
sat
down
humbly
beside
jane
oh
pray
with
me
she
said
pray
that
i
may
not
hate
for
to
hate
is
to
be
wicked
and
pray
that
i
may
not
love
for
to
love
is
to
be
dodd
retired
with
her
usual
tact
and
then
jane
hardie
being
alone
with
her
friend
and
full
of
sorrow
sympathy
and
faith
found
words
of
eloquence
almost
divine
to
raise
her
with
these
pious
consolations
julia
pride
and
now
relieved
of
her
great
terror
she
felt
her
insult
to
her
fingers
ends
i
never
degrade
myself
so
far
as
to
pine
for
another
lady
lover
she
said
i
resume
my
duties
in
another
sphere
and
try
to
face
the
world
by
degrees
i
am
not
quite
alone
in
it
i
have
my
mother
still
and
my
some
tears
forced
their
way
at
these
brave
gentle
words
jane
gave
her
time
then
she
said
begin
by
putting
on
your
bonnet
and
visiting
with
me
come
with
one
who
is
herself
thwarted
in
the
carnal
affections
come
with
her
and
see
how
sick
some
are
and
we
two
in
health
how
racked
with
pain
some
are
and
we
two
at
ease
how
hungry
some
and
we
have
abundance
and
above
all
in
what
spiritual
deserts
some
lie
while
we
walk
in
the
gospel
oh
that
i
had
the
strength
said
julia
i
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
went
down
with
her
friend
but
at
the
street
door
the
strange
feeling
of
shame
overpowered
her
she
blushed
and
trembled
and
begged
to
substitute
the
garden
for
the
road
jane
consented
and
said
everything
must
have
a
beginning
the
fresh
air
the
bursting
buds
and
all
the
face
of
nature
did
julia
good
and
she
felt
it
you
little
angel
said
she
with
something
of
her
old
impetuosity
you
have
saved
me
i
was
making
myself
worse
by
shutting
myself
up
in
that
one
miserable
they
walked
hand
in
hand
for
a
good
half
hour
and
then
jane
said
she
must
go
papa
would
miss
her
julia
was
sorry
to
part
with
her
and
almost
without
thinking
accompanied
her
through
the
house
to
the
front
gate
and
that
was
another
point
gained
i
never
was
so
sorry
to
part
with
you
love
said
she
when
will
you
come
again
we
leave
i
am
selfish
to
detain
you
but
it
seems
as
if
my
guardian
angel
was
leaving
jane
smiled
i
must
go
said
she
but
i
leave
better
angels
than
i
am
behind
me
i
leave
you
this
yourself
under
the
mighty
hand
of
god
when
it
seems
most
harsh
then
it
is
most
loving
pray
for
faith
to
say
with
me
us
by
a
way
that
we
know
not
they
kissed
one
another
and
julia
stood
at
the
gate
and
looked
lovingly
after
her
with
the
tears
standing
thick
in
her
own
violet
eyes
now
maxley
was
coming
down
the
road
all
grizzly
and
bloodshot
baited
by
the
boys
who
had
gradually
swelled
in
number
as
he
drew
nearer
the
town
jane
was
shocked
at
their
heathenish
cruelty
and
went
off
the
path
to
remonstrate
with
them
on
this
maxley
fell
upon
her
and
began
beating
her
about
the
head
and
shoulders
with
his
heavy
stick
the
miserable
boys
uttered
yells
of
dismay
but
did
nothing
julia
uttered
a
violent
scream
but
flew
to
her
friend
aid
and
crying
oh
you
wretch
you
wretch
actually
caught
the
man
by
the
throat
and
shook
him
violently
he
took
his
hand
off
jane
hardie
who
instantly
sank
moaning
on
the
ground
and
he
cowered
like
a
cur
at
the
voice
and
the
purple
gleaming
eyes
of
the
excited
girl
the
air
filled
with
cries
and
edward
ran
out
of
the
house
to
see
what
was
the
matter
but
on
the
spot
nobody
was
game
enough
to
come
between
the
furious
man
and
the
fiery
girl
the
consequence
was
her
impetuous
courage
began
to
flag
and
her
eye
to
waver
the
demented
man
found
this
out
by
some
half
animal
instinct
and
instantly
caught
her
by
the
shoulder
and
whirled
her
down
on
her
knees
then
raised
his
staff
high
to
destroy
her
she
screamed
and
was
just
putting
up
her
hands
womanlike
not
to
see
her
death
as
well
as
feel
it
when
something
dark
came
past
her
like
a
rushing
wind
a
blow
that
sounded
exactly
like
that
of
a
paving
ram
caught
maxley
on
the
jaw
and
there
was
edward
dodd
blowing
like
a
grampus
with
rage
and
maxley
on
his
back
in
the
road
but
men
under
cerebral
excitement
are
not
easily
stunned
and
know
no
pain
he
bounded
off
the
ground
and
came
at
edward
like
a
spanish
bull
edward
slipped
aside
and
caught
him
another
ponderous
blow
that
sent
him
staggering
and
his
bludgeon
flew
out
of
his
hand
and
edward
caught
it
lo
the
maniac
flew
at
him
again
more
fiercely
than
ever
but
the
young
hercules
had
seen
jane
bleeding
on
the
ground
he
dealt
her
assailant
in
full
career
such
a
murderous
stroke
with
the
bludgeon
that
the
people
who
were
running
from
all
quarters
shrieked
with
dismay
not
for
jane
but
for
maxley
and
well
they
might
that
awful
stroke
laid
him
senseless
motionless
and
mute
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
do
kill
him
sir
do
kill
the
man
was
the
cry
why
not
said
edward
sternly
he
then
kneeled
over
his
sweetheart
and
lifted
her
in
his
arms
like
a
child
her
bonnet
was
all
broken
her
eyes
were
turned
upwards
and
set
and
a
little
blood
trickled
down
her
cheek
and
that
cheek
seemed
streaked
white
and
red
he
was
terrified
agonised
yet
he
gasped
out
you
are
safe
dear
do
be
she
knew
the
voice
oh
edward
she
said
piteously
and
tenderly
and
then
moaned
a
little
on
his
broad
bosom
he
carried
her
into
the
house
out
of
the
crowd
poor
old
doctor
phillips
coming
in
to
end
his
days
in
the
almshouse
had
seen
it
all
he
got
out
of
his
cart
and
hobbled
up
he
had
been
in
the
army
and
had
both
experience
and
skill
he
got
her
bonnet
off
and
at
sight
of
her
head
looked
very
grave
in
a
minute
a
bed
was
laid
in
the
and
all
the
windows
and
doors
open
and
edward
trembling
now
in
every
limb
ran
to
musgrove
cottage
while
dodd
and
julia
loosened
the
poor
girl
dress
and
bathed
her
wounds
with
tepid
water
the
doctor
would
not
allow
cold
and
put
wine
carefully
to
her
lips
with
a
teaspoon
wanted
at
your
house
pray
what
for
said
hardie
superciliously
oh
sir
said
edward
such
a
calamity
pray
come
directly
a
ruffian
has
struck
her
has
hurt
her
terribly
her
who
asked
hardie
beginning
to
be
uneasy
who
why
jane
your
daughter
man
and
there
you
sit
chattering
instead
of
coming
at
hardie
rose
hurriedly
and
put
on
his
hat
and
accompanied
him
half
confused
soon
edward
mute
agitation
communicated
itself
to
him
and
he
went
striding
and
trembling
by
his
side
the
crowd
had
gone
with
insensible
maxley
to
the
hospital
but
the
traces
of
the
terrible
combat
were
there
where
maxley
fell
the
last
time
a
bullock
seemed
to
have
been
slaughtered
at
the
least
the
miserable
father
came
on
this
and
gave
a
great
scream
like
a
woman
and
staggered
back
white
as
a
sheet
edward
laid
his
hand
on
him
for
he
seemed
scarce
able
to
stand
no
no
no
he
cried
comprehending
the
mistake
at
last
that
is
not
hers
heaven
forbid
that
is
the
madman
who
did
it
i
knocked
him
down
with
his
own
god
bless
you
you
killed
him
i
oh
sir
be
more
merciful
and
then
perhaps
he
will
be
merciful
to
us
and
not
take
this
angel
from
no
no
you
are
right
good
young
man
i
little
thought
i
had
such
a
friend
in
your
do
deceive
yourself
sir
said
edward
it
not
you
i
care
for
then
with
a
great
cry
of
anguish
i
love
at
this
blunt
declaration
so
new
and
so
offensive
to
him
hardie
winced
and
stopped
bewildered
but
they
were
at
the
gate
and
edward
hurried
him
on
at
the
house
door
he
drew
back
once
more
for
he
felt
a
shiver
of
repugnance
at
entering
this
hateful
house
of
whose
happiness
he
was
the
destroyer
but
enter
it
he
must
it
was
his
fate
the
wife
of
the
poor
captain
he
had
driven
mad
met
him
in
the
passage
her
motherly
eyes
full
of
tears
for
him
and
both
hands
held
out
to
him
like
a
pitying
angel
oh
hardie
she
said
in
a
broken
voice
and
took
him
and
led
him
stupefied
shivering
with
dark
fears
to
the
room
where
his
crushed
daughter
lay
chapter
xxxviii
hardie
found
his
daughter
lying
ashy
pale
on
a
little
bed
in
the
of
albion
villa
she
was
now
scarce
conscious
the
old
doctor
sat
at
her
head
looking
very
grave
and
julia
kneeled
over
her
beloved
friend
pale
as
herself
with
hands
clasped
convulsively
and
great
eyes
of
terror
and
grief
that
vivid
young
face
full
of
foreboding
and
woe
struck
hardie
the
moment
he
entered
and
froze
his
very
heart
the
strong
man
quivered
and
sank
slowly
like
a
felled
tree
by
the
bedside
and
his
face
and
the
poor
girl
whose
earthly
happiness
he
had
coldly
destroyed
nearly
met
over
his
crushed
daughter
jane
my
child
he
gasped
my
poor
little
jane
oh
let
me
sleep
she
moaned
feebly
darling
it
your
own
papa
said
julia
softly
poor
papa
said
she
turning
rather
to
julia
than
to
him
let
me
she
was
in
a
half
lethargic
state
hardie
asked
the
doctor
in
an
agitated
whisper
if
he
might
move
her
home
the
doctor
shook
his
head
not
by
my
advice
her
pulse
is
scarce
perceptible
we
must
not
move
her
nor
excite
her
nor
yet
let
her
sink
into
lethargy
she
is
in
great
danger
very
at
these
terrible
words
hardie
groaned
and
they
all
began
to
speak
below
the
breath
edward
murmured
dodd
hurriedly
run
and
put
off
the
auction
put
it
off
altogether
then
go
to
the
railway
nothing
must
come
here
to
make
a
noise
and
get
straw
put
down
directly
do
that
first
you
are
kinder
to
me
than
i
deserve
muttered
hardie
humbly
quite
cowed
by
the
blow
that
had
fallen
on
him
the
words
agitated
dodd
with
many
thoughts
but
she
whispered
as
calmly
as
she
could
let
us
think
of
nothing
now
but
this
precious
hardie
begged
to
see
the
extent
of
the
injury
dodd
dissuaded
him
but
he
persisted
then
the
doctor
showed
her
poor
head
at
that
the
father
uttered
a
scream
and
sat
quivering
julia
buried
her
face
in
the
directly
and
sobbed
vehemently
it
passed
faintly
across
the
benumbed
and
shuddering
father
how
she
loves
my
child
they
all
love
her
but
the
thought
made
little
impression
at
the
time
the
mind
was
too
full
of
terror
and
woe
the
doctor
now
asked
for
brandy
in
a
whisper
dodd
left
the
room
with
stealthy
foot
and
brought
it
he
asked
for
a
quill
julia
went
with
swift
stealthy
foot
and
brought
it
with
adroit
and
tender
hands
they
aided
the
doctor
and
trickled
stimulants
down
her
throat
then
sat
like
statues
of
grief
about
the
bed
only
every
now
and
then
eye
sought
eye
and
endeavoured
to
read
what
the
other
thought
was
there
hope
was
there
none
and
so
roving
is
the
mind
especially
when
the
body
is
still
these
statues
began
to
thrill
with
thoughts
of
the
past
as
well
as
the
absorbing
present
ay
here
were
met
a
strange
party
a
stranger
for
its
size
methinks
never
yet
met
on
earth
to
mingle
their
hearts
together
in
one
grief
just
think
of
him
who
sat
there
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
and
his
frame
shuddering
all
the
others
were
the
victims
yet
the
lady
whose
husband
he
had
robbed
and
driven
mad
pitied
and
sympathised
with
him
and
he
saw
it
the
lady
whom
he
had
insulted
at
the
altar
and
blighted
her
young
heart
and
life
pitied
and
sympathised
with
him
the
poor
old
doctor
pitied
and
sympathised
and
was
more
like
an
anxious
father
than
a
physician
even
jane
was
one
of
his
victims
for
she
fell
by
the
hand
of
a
man
he
had
dishonestly
ruined
and
driven
out
of
his
senses
thinking
of
all
he
had
done
and
this
the
end
of
it
he
was
at
once
crushed
and
melted
he
saw
with
awe
that
a
mightier
hand
than
man
was
upon
him
it
had
tossed
him
and
his
daughter
into
the
house
and
the
arms
of
the
injured
dodds
in
defiance
of
all
human
calculation
and
he
felt
himself
a
straw
in
that
hand
so
he
was
and
the
great
globe
itself
oh
if
jane
should
die
the
one
creature
he
loved
the
one
creature
bereaved
of
whom
he
could
get
no
joy
even
from
riches
what
would
he
not
give
to
recall
the
past
since
all
his
schemes
had
but
ended
in
this
thus
stricken
by
terror
of
the
divine
wrath
and
touched
by
the
goodness
and
kindness
of
those
he
had
cruelly
wronged
all
the
man
was
broken
with
remorse
then
he
vowed
to
undo
his
own
work
as
far
as
possible
he
would
do
anything
everything
if
heaven
would
spare
him
his
child
now
it
did
so
happen
that
these
resolves
earnest
and
sincere
but
somewhat
vague
were
soon
put
to
the
test
and
as
often
occurs
what
he
was
called
on
to
do
first
was
that
which
he
would
rather
have
done
last
thus
it
was
about
five
in
the
afternoon
jane
hardie
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
about
her
it
was
a
moment
of
intense
anxiety
they
all
made
signals
but
held
their
breath
she
smiled
at
sight
of
hardie
and
said
papa
dear
papa
there
was
great
joy
silent
on
the
part
of
dodd
and
julia
but
hardie
who
saw
in
this
a
good
omen
heaven
recognising
his
penitence
burst
out
she
knows
me
she
speaks
she
will
live
how
good
god
is
yes
my
darling
child
it
is
your
own
father
you
will
be
brave
and
get
well
for
my
jane
did
not
seem
to
pay
much
heed
to
these
words
she
looked
straight
before
her
like
one
occupied
with
her
own
thought
and
said
distinctly
and
solemnly
papa
send
for
it
fell
on
all
three
like
a
clap
of
thunder
those
gentle
but
decided
tones
those
simple
natural
words
julia
eyes
flashed
into
her
mother
and
then
sought
the
ground
directly
there
was
a
dead
silence
hardie
was
the
one
to
speak
why
for
him
dear
those
who
love
you
best
are
all
for
heaven
sake
do
thwart
her
sir
said
the
doctor
in
alarm
this
is
no
time
to
refuse
her
anything
in
your
power
sometimes
the
very
expectation
of
a
beloved
person
coming
keeps
them
alive
stimulates
the
hardie
was
sore
perplexed
he
recoiled
from
the
sudden
exposure
that
might
take
place
if
alfred
without
any
preparation
or
previous
conciliatory
measures
were
allowed
to
burst
in
upon
them
and
while
his
mind
was
whirling
within
him
in
doubt
and
perplexity
jane
spoke
again
but
no
longer
calmly
and
connectedly
she
was
beginning
to
wander
presently
in
her
wandering
she
spoke
of
edward
called
him
dear
edward
dodd
rose
hastily
and
her
first
impulse
was
to
ask
both
gentlemen
to
retire
so
instinctively
does
a
good
woman
protect
her
own
sex
against
the
other
but
reflecting
that
this
was
the
father
she
made
an
excuse
and
retired
herself
instead
followed
by
julia
the
doctor
divined
and
went
to
the
window
the
father
sat
by
the
bed
and
soon
gathered
his
daughter
loved
edward
dodd
the
time
was
gone
by
when
this
would
have
greatly
pained
him
he
sighed
like
one
overmatched
by
fate
but
said
you
shall
have
him
my
darling
he
is
a
good
young
man
he
shall
be
your
husband
you
shall
be
happy
only
live
for
my
sake
for
all
our
she
paid
no
attention
and
wandered
on
a
little
but
her
mind
gradually
cleared
and
she
asked
quietly
for
a
glass
of
water
hardie
gave
it
her
she
sipped
and
he
took
it
from
her
she
looked
at
him
close
and
said
distinctly
have
you
sent
for
alfred
no
love
not
not
yet
there
is
no
time
to
lose
she
said
gravely
hardie
trembled
then
being
alone
with
her
the
miserable
man
unable
to
say
no
unwilling
to
say
yes
tried
to
persuade
her
not
to
ask
for
alfred
my
dear
he
whispered
i
will
not
refuse
you
but
i
have
a
secret
to
confide
to
you
will
you
keep
it
yes
papa
poor
alfred
is
not
himself
he
has
delusions
he
is
partly
insane
my
brother
thomas
has
thought
it
best
for
us
all
to
put
him
under
gentle
restraint
for
a
time
it
would
retard
his
cure
to
have
him
down
here
and
subject
him
to
papa
said
jane
are
you
deceiving
me
or
are
you
imposed
upon
alfred
insane
it
is
a
falsehood
he
came
to
me
the
night
before
the
wedding
that
was
to
be
oh
my
brother
my
darling
brother
how
dare
they
say
you
are
insane
that
letter

for

than

her
poor
and
the
miserable
man
rushed
out
leaving
dodd
in
tears
for
him
he
was
no
sooner
gone
than
julia
came
in
and
clasped
her
mother
and
trembled
on
her
bosom
then
dodd
knew
she
had
overheard
hardie
last
words
jane
hardie
too
though
much
exhausted
by
the
scene
with
her
father
put
out
her
hand
to
julia
and
took
hers
and
said
feebly
but
with
a
sweet
smile
he
is
coming
love
all
shall
be
then
to
herself
as
it
were
and
looking
up
with
a
gentle
rapture
in
her
pale
face
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
for
they
shall
be
called
the
children
of
on
this
thought
she
seemed
to
feed
with
innocent
joy
but
for
a
long
time
was
too
weak
to
speak
again
hardie
rushing
from
the
house
found
edward
at
work
outside
he
was
crying
undisguisedly
and
with
his
coat
off
working
harder
at
spreading
the
straw
than
both
the
two
men
together
he
had
got
to
help
him
hardie
took
his
hand
and
wrung
it
but
could
not
speak
in
half
an
hour
a
trusty
agent
he
had
often
employed
was
at
the
station
waiting
for
the
up
train
nearly
due
he
came
back
to
albion
villa
julia
met
him
on
the
stairs
with
her
fingers
to
her
lips
she
is
sleeping
the
doctor
has
hopes
oh
sir
let
us
all
pray
for
her
day
and
hardie
blessed
her
it
seemed
the
face
of
an
angel
so
earnest
so
lovely
so
pious
he
went
home
and
at
the
door
of
his
own
house
peggy
met
him
with
anxious
looks
he
told
her
what
he
had
done
good
heavens
said
she
have
you
forgotten
he
says
he
will
kill
you
the
first
day

i
do

what
becomes
of
me
i
care
only
for
my
child
leave
me
peggy
there

he
was
no
sooner
alone
than
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
offered
the
great
author
of
life
and
death
a
bargain
o
god
he
cried
i
own
my
sins
and
i
repent
them

but
my
child

sinned
against
thee
and
i
will
undo

but
and
now
the
whistle
sounded
the
train
moved
and
his
messenger
was
flying
fast
to
london
with
a
note
to
wycherley
dear
sir
my
poor
daughter

dangerously
wounded
and
perhaps
at
the
point
of
death

to

bearer

richard
hardie
chapter
xxxix
short
arrived
approved
phillips
treatment
and
said
the
case
was
severe
but
not
hopeless
and
he
would
call
again
a
bed
was
prepared
in
the
house
for
hardie
but
neither
he
nor
any
of
the
dodds
closed
an
eye
that
sorrowful
night
about
midnight
after
a
short
slumber
the
sufferer
became
uneasy
and
begged
to
be
left
with
julia
julia
was
sent
for
and
found
her
a
good
deal
excited
she
inquired
more
than
once
if
they
were
quite
alone
and
then
asked
for
paper
and
a
pencil
she
wrote
a
few
lines
and
made
julia
put
them
in
a
cover
and
seal
them
now
dear
friend
she
said
promise
me
not
to
open
this
nor
even
to
let
your
mother
it
is
not
for
your
happiness
that
what
i
have
written
should
be
seen
by
her
or
you
no
no
much
better
not
come
dear
friend
pledge
me
your
julia
pledged
her
honour
then
jane
wrote
on
the
cover
from
a
dying
julia
saw
that
and
wept
sore
jane
comforted
her
do
not
weep
for
me
love
i
am
content
to
go
or
stay
this
is
not
my
doing
so
i
know
it
must
be
for
the
best
he
is
leading
me
by
a
way
that
i
know
not
oh
my
beloved
friend
how
sweet
it
is
to
lie
in
his
hands
and
know
no
will
but
his
ay
i
thank
him
for
crossing
my
will
and
leading
me
to
himself
by
his
own
good
way
and
not
by
poor
blind
foolish
in
this
spirit
of
full
resignation
she
abode
constant
and
consoled
her
weeping
friends
from
time
to
time
whenever
she
was
quite
herself
about
daybreak
being
alone
with
her
father
she
shed
a
few
tears
at
his
lonely
condition
i
fear
you
will
miss
me
said
she
take
my
advice
dear
be
reconciled
with
alfred
at
once
and
let
julia
be
your
daughter
since
i
am
leaving
you
she
is
all
humility
and
heart
dying
i
prize
her
and
her
affection
more
highly
i
seem
to
see
characters
clearer
all
things
clearer
than
i
did
before
my
summons
the
miserable
father
tried
to
be
playful
and
scold
her
you
must
not
talk
nor
think
of
death
he
said
your
is
to
come
first
i
know
all
edward
dodd
has
told
me
he
loves
you
he
is
a
fine
noble
fellow
you
shall
marry
him
i
wish
it
now
for
his
sake
summon
all
your
resolution
and
make
up
your
mind
to
live
why
at
your
age
it
needs
but
to
say
will
live
i
will
i
will
and
when
all
the
prospect
is
so
smiling
when
love
awaits
you
at
the
altar
and
on
every
side
if
you
could
leave
your
poor
doting
father
do
not
leave
your
lover
and
here
he
is
with
his
mother
crying
for
you
let
me
comfort
him
let
me
tell
him
you
will
live
for
his
sake
and
even
this
could
not
disturb
the
dying
christian
dear
edward
she
said
it
is
sweet
to
know
he
loves
me
ah
well
he
is
young
he
must
live
without
me
till
i
become
but
a
tender
memory
of
his
youth
and
oh
i
pray
for
him
that
he
may
cherish
the
words
i
have
spoken
to
him
for
his
soul
good
far
longer
than
he
can
remember
these
features
that
are
hastening
to
at
ten
in
the
morning
hardie
messenger
returned
without
alfred
and
with
a
note
from
wycherley
to
this
effect
that
the
order
for
alfred
admission
into
his
asylum
being
signed
by
thomas
hardie
he
could
not
send
him
out
even
for
a
day
except
on
thomas
authority
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
law
under
the
circumstances
however
he
thought
he
might
venture
to
receive
that
order
by
telegraph
if
then
hardie
would
telegraph
thomas
hardie
in
yorkshire
to
telegraph
him
wycherley
alfred
should
be
sent
with
two
keepers
wherever
hardie
should
so
direct
now
hardie
had
already
repented
of
sending
for
alfred
at
all
so
instead
of
telegraphing
yorkshire
he
remained
passive
and
said
sullenly
to
dodd
alfred
ca
come
it
thus
routine
kept
the
brother
from
his
dying
sister
they
told
jane
with
aching
hearts
there
was
reason
to
fear
alfred
could
not
arrive
that
day
she
only
gave
a
meaning
look
at
julia
about
the
paper
and
then
she
said
with
a
little
sigh
god
will
be
this
was
the
last
disappointment
heaven
allowed
earth
to
inflict
on
her
and
the
shield
of
faith
turned
its
edge
one
hour
of
pain
another
of
delirium
and
now
the
clouds
that
darken
this
mortal
life
seemed
to
part
and
pass
and
heaven
to
open
full
upon
her
she
spoke
of
her
coming
change
no
longer
with
resignation
it
was
with
rapture
oh
she
cried
to
think
that
from
this
very
day
i
shall
never
sin
again
shall
never
again
offend
him
by
unholy
temper
by
behaviour
the
strong
and
healthy
wept
and
groaned
aloud
but
she
they
sorrowed
for
was
all
celestial
bliss
in
her
lifetime
she
had
her
ups
and
downs
of
religious
fervour
was
not
without
feverish
heats
and
cold
misgivings
and
depression
but
all
these
fled
at
that
dread
hour
when
the
wicked
are
a
prey
to
dark
misgivings
or
escape
into
apathy
this
timid
girl
that
would
have
screamed
at
a
scratch
met
the
king
of
terrors
with
smiles
and
triumph
for
her
the
grave
was
jordan
and
death
was
but
the
iron
gate
of
life
everlasting
janua
yet
once
or
twice
she
took
herself
to
task
but
only
to
show
she
knew
what
the
had
forgiven
her
i
often
was
wanting
in
humility
she
said
i
almost
think
that
if
i
were
to
be
sent
back
again
into
this
world
of
sin
and
sorrow
i
am
leaving
behind
i
should
grow
a
little
in
humility
for
i
know
the
ripe
christian
is
like
the
ripe
corn
holds
his
head
lower
than
when
he
was
green
and
the
grave
it
seems
to
be
ripening
me
but
what
does
it
matter
since
he
who
died
for
me
is
content
to
take
me
as
i
am
come
quickly
lord
jesus
oh
come
quickly
relieve
thy
servant
from
the
burden
of
the
flesh
and
of
the
sins
and
foibles
that
cling
to
it
and
keep
her
these
many
years
from
this
prayer
was
granted
the
body
failed
more
and
more
she
could
not
swallow
even
a
drop
of
wine
she
could
not
even
praise
her
redeemer
that
is
to
say
she
could
not
speak
yet
she
lay
and
triumphed
with
hands
put
together
in
prayer
and
eyes
full
of
praise
and
joy
unspeakable
she
climbed
fast
to
god
while
she
so
mounted
in
the
spirit
her
breath
came
at
intervals
unusually
long
and
all
were
sent
for
to
see
death
conquer
the
body
and
be
conquered
by
the
soul
at
last
after
an
unnaturally
long
interval
she
drew
a
breath
like
a
sigh
they
waited
for
another
waited
waited
in
vain
she
had
calmly
ceased
to
live
the
old
doctor
laid
down
her
hand
reverently
and
said
she
is
with
us
no
then
with
many
tears
oh
may
we
all
meet
where
she
is
now
and
may
i
go
to
her
the
richard
hardie
was
led
from
the
room
in
a
stupor
immediately
after
death
all
the
disfiguring
effect
of
pain
retired
and
the
happy
soul
seemed
to
have
stamped
its
own
celestial
rapture
on
the
countenance
at
the
moment
of
leaving
it
a
rapture
so
wonderful
so
divine
so
more
than
mortal
calm
irradiated
the
dead
face
the
good
christians
she
left
behind
her
looked
on
and
feared
to
weep
lest
they
should
offend
him
who
had
taken
her
to
himself
and
set
a
visible
seal
upon
the
house
of
clay
that
had
held
her
oh
mamma
cried
julia
with
fervour
look
look
can
we
dare
we
wish
that
angel
back
to
this
world
of
misery
and
sin
and
it
was
some
hours
before
she
cooled
and
began
to
hang
on
edward
neck
and
weep
his
loss
and
hers
as
weep
we
mortals
must
though
the
angels
of
heaven
are
rejoicing
thus
died
in
the
flower
of
her
youth
and
by
what
we
call
a
violent
death
the
one
child
richard
hardie
loved
member
of
a
religious
party
whose
diction
now
and
then
offends
one
to
the
soul
but
the
root
of
the
matter
is
in
them
allowance
made
for
those
passions
foibles
and
infirmities
of
the
flesh
even
you
and
i
are
not
entirely
free
from
they
live
fearing
god
and
die
loving
him
there
was
an
inquest
next
day
followed
in
due
course
by
a
public
trial
of
james
maxley
but
these
are
matters
which
though
rather
curious
and
interesting
must
be
omitted
or
touched
hereafter
and
briefly
the
effect
of
jane
death
on
richard
hardie
was
deplorable
he
saw
the
hand
of
heaven
but
did
not
bow
to
it
so
it
filled
him
with
rage
rebellion
and
despair
he
got
his
daughter
away
and
hid
himself
in
the
room
with
her
scarce
stirring
out
by
night
or
day
he
spoke
to
no
one
he
shunned
the
dodds
he
hated
them
he
said
it
was
through
visiting
their
house
she
had
met
her
death
and
at
their
door
he
would
not
let
himself
see
it
was
he
who
had
sent
her
there
with
his
lie
he
loathed
alfred
calling
him
the
cause
of
all
he
asked
nobody
to
the
funeral
and
when
edward
begged
permission
to
come
he
gave
a
snarl
like
a
wild
beast
and
went
raging
from
him
but
edward
would
go
and
at
the
graveside
pitying
heaven
relieved
the
young
fellow
choking
heart
with
tears
but
no
such
dew
came
to
that
parched
old
man
who
stood
on
its
other
side
like
the
withered
archangel
his
eyes
gloomy
and
wild
his
white
cheek
ploughed
deep
with
care
and
crime
and
anguish
his
lofty
figure
bowed
by
his
long
warfare
his
soul
burning
and
sickening
by
turns
with
hatred
and
rebellion
with
desolation
and
despair
he
went
home
and
made
his
will
for
he
felt
life
hang
on
him
like
lead
and
that
any
moment
he
might
kill
himself
to
be
rid
of
it
strange
to
say
he
left
a
sum
of
money
to
edward
dodd
a
moment
before
he
know
he
was
going
to
do
it
a
moment
after
he
was
half
surprised
he
had
done
it
and
minded
to
undo
it
but
would
not
take
the
trouble
he
went
up
to
london
and
dashed
into
speculation
as
some
in
their
despair
take
to
drink
for
this
man
had
but
two
passions
avarice
and
his
love
for
his
daughter
bereaved
of
her
he
must
either
die
or
live
for
gain
he
sought
the
very
cave
of
mammon
he
plunged
into
the
stock
exchange
when
hardie
said
alfred
ca
come
it
seems
dodd
misunderstood
him
naturally
enough
she
thought
the
heartless
young
man
had
sent
some
excuse
had
chosen
to
let
his
sister
die
neglected
rather
than
face
julia
as
if
she
would
leave
her
own
room
while
was
in
my
house
said
dodd
with
sovereign
contempt
from
this
moment
she
conceived
a
horror
of
the
young
man
edward
shared
it
fully
and
the
pair
always
spoke
of
him
under
the
title
of
the
wretch
this
was
when
julia
was
not
by
in
her
presence
he
was
never
mentioned
by
this
means
she
would
in
time
forget
him
or
else
see
him
as
they
saw
him
and
as
after
all
they
knew
little
to
hardie
disadvantage
except
what
had
come
out
of
the
wretch
mouth
and
as
moreover
their
hearts
were
softened
towards
the
father
by
his
bereavement
and
their
sight
of
his
misery
and
also
by
his
grateful
words
they
quite
acquitted
him
of
having
robbed
them
and
felt
sure
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
they
were
a
little
surprised
that
hardie
never
spoke
nor
wrote
to
them
again
but
being
and
sweet
tempered
they
set
it
down
to
grief
and
would
not
feel
sore
about
it
and
now
they
must
leave
the
little
villa
where
they
had
been
so
happy
and
so
unhappy
the
scanty
furniture
went
first
dodd
followed
and
arranged
it
in
their
apartments
julia
would
stay
behind
to
comfort
edward
inconsolable
herself
the
auction
came
off
most
of
the
things
went
for
cruelly
little
money
compared
to
their
value
and
with
the
balance
the
sad
young
pair
came
up
to
london
and
were
clasped
in
their
arms
the
tears
were
in
her
tender
eyes
it
is
a
poor
place
to
receive
my
treasures
she
said
edward
looked
round
astonished
it
was
a
poor
place
said
he
but
you
have
made
a
little
palace
of
it
somehow
or
my
children
love
can
alone
do
that
replied
dodd
kissing
them
both
again
next
day
they
consulted
together
how
they
were
to
live
edward
wished
to
try
and
get
his
father
into
a
public
asylum
then
his
mother
would
have
a
balance
to
live
upon
out
of
her
income
but
dodd
rejected
this
proposal
with
astonishment
in
vain
edward
cited
the
that
public
asylums
are
patterns
of
comfort
and
cure
twice
as
many
patients
as
the
private
ones
do
she
was
deaf
alike
to
the
and
to
statistics
do
not
argue
me
out
of
my
common
sense
said
she
my
husband
your
father
in
a
public
asylum
where
anybody
can
go
and
stare
at
my
darling
she
then
informed
them
she
had
written
to
her
aunt
bazalgette
and
her
uncle
fountain
and
invited
them
to
contribute
something
towards
maintenance
edward
was
almost
angry
at
this
fancy
asking
favours
of
said
he
oh
i
must
not
sacrifice
my
family
to
false
pride
said
dodd
besides
they
are
entitled
to
while
waiting
for
their
answers
a
word
about
the
parties
and
their
niece
our
dodd
born
lucy
fountain
was
left
at
nineteen
to
the
care
of
two
guardians
her
uncle
fountain
an
old
bachelor
who
loved
comfort
pedigree
and
his
own
way
her
aunt
bazalgette
who
loved
flirting
dressing
and
her
own
way
both
charming
people
when
they
got
their
own
way
verjuice
when
they
did
and
to
conclude
egotists
deep
as
ocean
from
guardians
they
grew
and
rivals
by
proxy
uncle
schemed
to
graft
lucy
on
to
a
stick
called
talboys
that
came
in
with
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
known
in
pedigrees
as
the
norman
aunt
wife
of
a
merchant
of
no
descent
except
from
a
high
stool
devoted
her
to
richard
hardie
an
obstacle
encountered
both
lucy
was
not
amorous
she
loved
these
two
egotists
and
their
quadrupeds
but
there
she
stopped
dead
short
they
persisted
and
while
they
pulled
her
to
and
fro
and
ruffled
her
native
calm
david
dodd
first
mate
of
the
something
or
other
east
indiaman
brown
cheek
honest
speech
heart
of
gold
fell
deep
in
love
and
worshipped
her
at
a
distance
his
timidity
and
social
insignificance
made
him
harmless
so
egotist
fountain
had
him
in
to
dessert
to
spin
yarns
egotist
bazalgette
invited
him
to
her
house
to
flirt
with
at
this
latter
place
he
found
hardie
and
talboys
both
courting
lucy
this
drove
him
mad
and
in
his
fury
he
popped
lucy
declined
him
artem
he
went
away
blessing
her
with
a
manly
sob
or
two
lucy
cried
a
little
and
took
a
feminine
spite
against
his
rivals
who
remained
to
pester
her
now
talboys
spurred
by
uncle
had
often
all
but
popped
only
some
let
hindrance
or
just
impediment
had
still
interposed
once
her
pony
kept
prancing
at
each
effort
he
made
towards
hymen
they
do
say
the
subtle
virgin
kept
probing
the
brute
with
a
hair
pin
and
made
him
caracole
and
spill
the
treacle
as
fast
as
it
came
her
way
however
now
talboys
elected
to
pop
by
sea
it
was
the
element
his
ancestors
had
invaded
fair
england
by
and
on
its
tranquil
bosom
a
lover
is
safe
from
prancing
steeds
and
the
myriad
of
miss
lucy
consented
to
the
water
excursion
demurely
designing
to
bring
her
sickly
wooer
to
the
point
and
so
get
rid
of
him
for
ever
and
ever
plot
and
were
baffled
by
the
elements
there
came
an
out
of
the
called
a
gale
talboys
boated
so
skilfully
that
he
and
his
intended
would
have
been
united
without
ceremony
by
father
nep
at
the
bottom
of
the
british
channel
but
for
david
dodd
who
was
hovering
near
in
jealous
anguish
and
a
cutter
he
saved
them
both
but
in
the
doing
of
it
missed
his
ship
and
professional
ruin
faced
him
then
lucy
was
miserable
and
appealed
to
bazalgette
and
he
managed
somehow
to
get
david
made
captain
of
the
the
poor
girl
thought
she
had
squared
the
account
with
david
but
he
refused
the
ship
unless
she
would
go
halves
and
while
her
egotists
bullied
and
vexed
her
he
wrought
so
upon
her
pity
and
teased
her
so
that
to
get
rid
of
his
importunity
she
married
him
in
time
she
learned
to
love
him
ten
times
better
than
if
she
had
begun
all
flames
uncle
and
aunt
cut
her
tolerably
dead
for
some
years
uncle
came
round
the
first
some
antiquarian
showed
him
that
dodd
was
a
much
more
ancient
family
than
talboys
why
sir
they
were
lords
of
sixteen
manors
under
the
heptarchy
and
hold
some
of
them
to
this
bazalgette
too
had
long
corresponded
with
her
periodically
and
on
friendly
terms
the
answers
came
on
the
same
day
curiously
enough
uncle
fountain
ruined
by
railway
speculation
was
living
on
an
allowance
from
creditors
but
his
house
was
at
their
service
if
they
liked
to
live
with
him
and
board
themselves
bazalgette
was
the
letter
of
a
smooth
woman
who
has
hoarded
imperishable
spite
she
reminded
her
niece
after
all
these
years
that
her
marriage
with
david
was
an
act
of
disobedience
and
ingratitude
she
then
enumerated
her
own
heavy
expenses
all
but
the
a
year
she
spent
in
bedizening
her
carcass
and
finally
amidst
a
multitude
of
petty
insults
she
offered
to
relieve
dodd
of
julia
now
poetry
has
reconciled
us
to
an
asp
in
a
basket
of
figs
but
here
was
a
scorpion
in
a
bundle
of
nettles
poor
dodd
could
not
speak
after
reading
it
she
handed
it
to
edward
and
laid
her
white
forehead
wearily
in
her
hand
edward
put
the
letter
in
an
envelope
and
sent
it
back
with
a
line
in
his
own
hand
declining
all
further
correspondence
with
the
writer
now
then
ladies
said
he
do
you
be
cast
down
let
this
be
a
warning
to
us
never
to
ask
favours
of
anybody
let
us
look
the
thing
in
the
face
we
must
work
or
starve
and
all
the
better
for
us
hard
work
suits
heavy
hearts
come
have
you
any
plan
to
be
sure
we
have
said
julia
eagerly
i
mean
to
go
for
a
governess
and
then
i
shall
cost
mamma
nothing
and
besides
i
can
send
her
the
money
the
people
give
a
pretty
plan
said
edward
sadly
what
we
three
part
company
you
feel
lonely
enough
without
that
i
do
then
how
can
we
bear
our
burdens
at
all
if
we
are
not
to
be
all
together
to
cheer
one
another
along
the
weary
road
what
are
we
to
break
up
is
it
not
enough
to
be
bereaved
he
could
say
no
more
for
the
emotion
his
own
words
caused
him
thinking
of
jane
he
broke
down
altogether
and
ran
out
of
the
room
however
he
came
back
in
an
hour
with
his
eyes
red
but
his
heart
indomitable
determined
to
play
a
man
part
for
all
their
sakes
you
ladies
said
he
with
something
of
his
old
genial
way
that
sounded
so
strange
to
one
looking
at
his
red
eyes
and
inspired
a
desire
to
hug
him
are
full
of
talent
but
empty
of
invention
the
moment
you
are
ruined
or
that
sort
of
thing
it
is
for
a
governess
for
a
companion
here
there
in
search
of
what
independence
no
dependence
besides
all
this
is
bosh
families
are
strong
if
they
stick
together
and
if
they
go
to
pieces
they
are
weak
i
learned
one
bit
of
sense
out
of
that
mass
of
folly
they
call
antiquity
and
that
was
the
story
of
the
old
bloke
with
his
twelve
sons
and
fagot
to
match
apart
he
said
and
each
son
broke
his
stick
as
easy
as
shelling
peas
break
the
twelve
all
tied
together
devil
a
bit
could
the
duffers
break
it
then
now
we
are
not
twelve
we
are
but
three
easy
to
break
one
or
two
of
us
apart
but
not
the
lot
together
no
nothing
but
death
shall
break
this
fagot
for
nothing
less
shall
part
us
he
stood
like
a
colossus
and
held
out
his
hand
to
them
they
clung
round
his
neck
in
a
moment
as
if
to
illustrate
his
words
clung
tight
and
blessed
him
for
standing
so
firm
and
forbidding
them
to
part
dodd
sighed
after
the
first
burst
of
enthusiastic
affection
and
said
if
he
would
only
go
a
step
further
and
tell
us
what
to
do
in
ay
there
it
is
said
julia
begin
with
me
what
can
i
do
why
what
to
sell
oh
dear
my
daubs
are
not
good
enough
for
stuff
nothing
is
too
bad
to
i
really
think
you
might
said
dodd
and
i
will
help
no
no
mamma
i
want
you
for
something
better
than
the
fine
arts
you
must
go
in
one
of
the
great
grooves
female
vanity
you
must
be
a
dressmaker
you
are
a
genius
at
my
mamma
a
dressmaker
cried
julia
oh
edward
how
can
you
how
dare
you
poor
poor
mamma
do
not
be
so
impetuous
dear
i
think
he
is
right
yes
it
is
all
i
am
fit
for
if
ever
there
was
a
dressmaker
it
as
for
myself
said
edward
i
shall
look
out
for
some
business
in
which
physical
strength
goes
further
than
intellectual
attainments
luckily
there
are
plenty
such
breaking
stones
is
one
but
i
shall
try
a
few
others
it
is
easy
to
settle
on
a
business
hard
to
get
a
footing
in
one
edward
convinced
that
the
dressmaking
was
their
best
card
searched
that
mine
of
various
knowledge
the
for
an
opening
but
none
came
at
last
one
of
those
great
miscellaneous
houses
in
the
city
advertised
for
a
lady
to
cut
cloaks
he
proposed
to
his
mother
to
go
with
him
she
shrank
from
encountering
strangers
no
she
would
go
to
a
fashionable
dressmaker
she
had
employed
some
years
and
ask
her
advice
perhaps
madame
blanch
would
find
her
something
to
do
i
have
more
faith
in
the
said
edward
clinging
to
his
idol
dodd
found
madame
blanch
occupied
in
trying
to
suit
one
of
those
idiots
to
whom
dress
is
the
one
great
thing
and
all
things
else
sin
included
the
little
ones
she
had
tried
on
a
scarf
three
times
and
it
discontented
her
when
on
and
spoilt
all
else
when
off
dodd
saw
and
said
obligingly
perhaps
were
i
to
put
it
on
you
could
better
dodd
you
must
know
had
an
admirable
art
of
putting
on
a
shawl
or
scarf
with
apparent
she
settled
the
scarf
on
her
shapely
shoulders
so
happily
that
the
fish
bit
and
the
scarf
went
into
its
carriage
forty
guineas
or
so
madame
cast
a
rapid
but
ardent
glance
of
gratitude
the
customer
began
to
go
and
after
fidgeting
to
the
door
and
back
for
twenty
minutes
actually
went
somehow
then
madame
turned
round
and
said
i
sure
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
you
sold
me
the
scarf
and
it
is
a
pity
we
could
put
her
on
your
bust
and
shoulders
then
perhaps
a
scarf
might
please
her
what
can
i
do
for
you
dodd
blushed
and
with
subdued
agitation
told
madame
blanch
that
this
time
she
was
come
not
to
purchase
but
to
ask
a
favour
misfortune
was
heavy
on
her
and
though
not
penniless
she
was
so
reduced
by
her
husband
illness
and
the
loss
of
by
shipwreck
that
she
must
employ
what
little
talents
she
had
to
support
her
family
the
woman
explored
her
from
head
to
foot
to
find
the
change
of
fortune
in
some
corner
of
her
raiment
but
her
customer
was
as
well
though
plainly
dressed
as
ever
and
still
looked
an
duchess
could
madame
blanch
find
her
employment
in
her
own
line
what
talent
i
have
said
dodd
humbly
lies
in
that
way
i
could
not
cut
as
well
as
yourself
of
course
but
i
think
i
can
as
well
as
some
of
your
that
i
be
bound
you
can
said
madame
blanch
drily
but
dear
dear
to
think
of
your
having
come
down
so
have
a
glass
of
wine
to
cheer
you
a
bit
do
now
that
is
a
good
oh
no
madam
i
thank
you
but
wine
can
not
cheer
me
a
little
bit
of
good
news
to
take
back
to
my
anxious
children
that
would
cheer
me
madam
you
be
so
good
the
dressmaker
coloured
and
hesitated
she
felt
the
fascination
of
dignity
donning
humility
and
speaking
music
but
she
resisted
it
wo
do
at
least
here
i
should
be
mistress
in
my
own
place
i
could
drive
you
like
i
am
forced
to
do
the
rest
and
then
i
should
be
sure
to
favour
you
being
a
real
lady
which
is
my
taste
and
you
always
will
be
rich
or
poor
and
then
all
my
ladies
would
be
on
the
bile
with
ah
madam
sighed
dodd
you
treat
me
like
a
child
you
give
me
sweetmeats
and
refuse
me
food
for
my
no
no
said
the
woman
hastily
i
do
say
i
might
send
you
out
some
work
to
do
at
oh
thank
you
the
dressmaker
had
dropped
the
madam
so
the
lady
used
it
now
at
every
word
now
stop
a
bit
said
madame
blanch
i
know
a
firm
that
in
want
theirs
is
easy
work
by
mine
and
they
cut
up
a
piece
of
stuff
every
two
or
three
she
then
wrote
on
one
of
her
own
cards
cross
fitchett
copland
and
tylee
and
primrose
lane
city
say
i
recommend
you
to
tell
the
truth
an
old
hand
of
my
own
was
to
come
here
this
very
morning
about
it
but
she
has
kept
her
time
so
this
will
learn
her
business
does
stand
still
for
to
catch
dodd
put
the
card
in
her
bosom
and
pressed
the
hand
extended
to
her
by
madame
zaire
blanch
whose
name
was
sally
white
spinster
she
went
back
to
her
children
and
showed
them
the
card
and
sank
gracefully
into
a
chair
exhausted
as
much
by
the
agitation
of
asking
favours
as
by
the
walk
cross
fitchett
copland
why
they
were
in
the
yesterday
said
edward
look
at
this
a
day
lost
by
being
wiser
than
the
i
waste
no
more
then
said
dodd
rising
quietly
from
the
chair
they
begged
her
to
rest
herself
first
no
she
would
not
i
saw
this
lost
by
half
an
hour
said
she
succeed
or
fail
i
will
have
no
remissness
to
reproach
myself
and
she
glided
off
in
her
quiet
way
to
encounter
cross
fitchett
copland
and
tylee
in
the
lane
where
a
primrose
was
caught
growing
six
hundred
years
ago
she
declined
edward
company
rather
peremptorily
stay
and
comfort
your
sister
said
she
but
that
was
a
blind
the
truth
was
she
could
not
bear
her
children
to
mingle
in
what
she
was
doing
no
her
ambition
was
to
ply
the
scissors
and
thimble
vigorously
and
so
enable
them
to
be
ladies
and
gentlemen
at
large
she
being
gone
julia
made
a
parcel
of
drawings
and
sallied
forth
all
on
fire
to
sell
them
but
while
she
was
dressing
edward
started
on
a
cruise
in
search
of
employment
he
failed
entirely
they
met
in
the
evening
dodd
resigned
edward
dogged
julia
rather
excited
now
let
us
tell
our
adventures
she
said
as
for
me
shop
after
shop
declined
my
poor
sketches
they
all
wanted
something
about
as
good
only
a
little
different
nobody
complained
of
the
grand
fault
and
that
is
their
utter
badness
at
last
one
old
gentleman
examined
them
and
oh
he
was
so
fat
there
round
and
he
twisted
his
mouth
so
imitating
him
and
squinted
into
them
so
then
i
was
full
of
hope
and
said
to
myself
mamma
and
edward
and
so
when
he
ended
by
saying
like
all
the
rest
i
burst
out
crying
like
a
goose
my
poor
girl
cried
dodd
with
tears
in
her
own
eyes
why
expose
yourself
to
these
cruel
rebuffs
oh
do
waste
your
pity
mamma
those
great
babyish
tears
were
a
happy
thought
of
mine
he
bought
two
directly
to
pacify
me
and
the
money
thirty
shillings
and
she
laid
it
proudly
on
the
table
the
old
cheat
said
edward
they
were
worth
two
guineas
apiece
i
not
they
or
why
would
not
anybody
else
give
twopence
for
them
because
pictures
are
a
he
added
that
even
talent
was
not
saleable
unless
it
got
into
the
great
grooves
and
then
looked
at
dodd
she
replied
that
unfortunately
those
grooves
were
not
always
accessible
the
city
firm
had
received
her
stiffly
and
inquired
for
whom
she
had
worked
children
my
heart
fell
at
that
question
i
was
obliged
to
own
myself
an
amateur
and
beg
a
trial
however
i
gave
madame
blanch
card
but
i
do
know
which
partner
it
was
said
he
was
not
acquainted
with
her
then
he
looked
a
little
embarrassed
i
thought
and
said
the
firm
did
not
care
to
send
its
stuff
to
ladies
not
in
the
business
i
might
cut
it
to
waste
or
he
said
no
more
but
i
do
really
think
he
meant
i
might
purloin
why
was
i
there
to
look
him
into
the
earth
oh
mamma
that
you
should
be
subjected
to
all
this
be
quiet
child
i
had
only
to
put
on
my
armour
and
do
you
know
what
my
armour
is
thinking
of
my
children
so
i
put
on
my
armour
and
said
quietly
we
were
not
so
poor
but
we
could
pay
for
a
piece
of
cloth
should
i
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
spoil
it
and
i
offered
in
plain
terms
to
deposit
the
price
as
security
but
he
turned
as
stiff
at
that
as
his
yard
measure
was
not
cross
and
way
of
doing
business
he
said
but
it
is
unreasonable
to
be
dejected
at
a
repulse
or
two
and
i
am
not
out
of
spirits
not
much
with
this
her
gentle
mouth
smiled
and
her
patient
eyes
were
moist
the
next
day
just
after
breakfast
was
announced
a
gentleman
from
the
city
he
made
his
bow
and
produced
a
parcel
which
proved
to
be
a
pattern
cloak
order
ladies
said
he
briskly
from
cross
fitchett
and
primrose
lane
porter
outside
with
the
piece
you
can
come
in
porter
entered
with
a
bale
please
sign
this
dodd
signed
a
receipt
for
the
stuff
with
an
undertaking
to
deliver
it
in
cloaks
at
primrose
lane
in
such
a
time
porter
retreated
the
other
said
our
fitchett
wishes
you
to
observe
this
fall
in
the
pattern
it
is
i
will
sir
am
i
to
trouble
you
with
any
money
by
way
of
deposit
sir
no
orders
about
it
ladies
your
most
obedient
good
morning
and
he
was
away
all
this
seemed
like
a
click
or
two
of
city
followed
by
rural
silence
yet
in
that
minute
commerce
had
walked
in
upon
genteel
poverty
and
left
honest
labour
and
modest
income
behind
her
great
was
the
thankfulness
strange
and
new
the
excitement
edward
was
employed
to
set
up
a
very
long
deal
table
for
his
mother
to
work
on
julia
to
go
and
buy
tailors
scissors
calculations
were
made
how
to
cut
the
stuff
to
advantage
and
in
due
course
the
heavy
scissors
were
heard
snick
snick
snicking
all
day
long
julia
painted
zealously
and
edward
without
saying
a
word
to
them
walked
twenty
miles
a
day
hunting
for
a
guinea
a
week
and
finding
it
not
not
but
what
employment
was
often
bobbed
before
his
eyes
but
there
was
no
grasping
it
at
last
he
heard
of
a
place
peculiarly
suited
to
him
a
packing
foreman
in
a
warehouse
at
southwark
he
went
there
and
was
referred
to
mr
a
private
house
was
in
the
country
for
a
day
try
was
dining
with
the
lord
mayor
returning
belated
he
fell
in
with
a
fire
and
sad
to
say
life
was
in
jeopardy
a
little
old
man
had
run
out
at
the
first
alarm
when
there
was
no
danger
and
as
soon
as
the
fire
was
hot
had
run
in
again
for
his
stockings
or
some
such
treasure
fire
does
put
out
some
reason
clean
while
he
was
rummaging
madly
the
staircase
caught
and
the
smoke
cut
off
his
second
exit
and
drove
him
up
to
a
little
staircase
window
at
the
side
of
the
house
here
he
stood
hose
in
hand
scorching
behind
and
screeching
in
front
a
ladder
had
been
brought
but
it
was
a
yard
short
and
the
poor
old
man
danced
on
the
and
dare
not
come
down
to
a
gallant
fireman
who
stood
ready
to
receive
him
at
great
personal
peril
in
the
midst
of
shrieks
and
cries
and
shouts
of
encouragement
edward
a
practised
gymnast
saw
a
chance
he
ran
up
the
ladder
like
a
cat
begged
the
fireman
to
clasp
it
tight
then
got
on
his
shoulders
and
managed
to
grasp
the
he
could
always
draw
his
own
weight
up
by
his
hands
so
he
soon
had
his
knee
on
the
sill
and
presently
stood
erect
he
then
put
his
left
arm
inside
the
window
collared
the
old
fellow
with
his
right
and
half
persuasion
half
force
actually
lowered
him
to
the
ladder
with
one
herculean
arm
amidst
a
roar
that
made
the
borough
ring
such
a
strain
could
not
long
be
endured
but
the
fireman
speedily
relieved
him
by
seizing
the
old
fellow
feet
and
directing
them
on
to
the
ladder
and
so
propping
him
by
the
waist
went
down
before
him
and
landed
him
safe
edward
waited
till
they
were
down
then
begged
them
to
hold
the
ladder
tight
below
he
hung
from
the
ledge
got
his
eye
well
on
the
ladder
below
him
let
himself
quietly
drop
and
caught
hold
of
it
with
hands
of
iron
and
twisting
round
came
down
the
ladder
on
the
inside
hand
over
head
without
using
his
feet
a
favourite
gymnastic
exercise
of
his
learnt
at
the
modern
athens
he
was
warmly
received
by
the
crowd
and
by
the
firemen
you
should
be
one
of
us
sir
said
a
fine
young
fellow
who
had
cheered
him
and
advised
him
all
through
i
wish
to
heaven
i
was
said
edward
the
other
thought
he
was
joking
but
laughed
and
said
then
you
should
talk
to
our
head
man
after
the
business
there
is
a
vacancy
you
edward
saw
the
fire
out
and
rode
home
on
the
engine
there
he
applied
to
the
head
man
for
the
vacancy
you
are
a
stranger
to
me
sir
said
the
head
man
and
i
am
sure
it
is
no
place
for
you
you
are
a
well
is
there
anything
ungentlemanly
in
saving
people
lives
and
property
hear
hear
said
a
comic
fireman
the
compliment
began
to
tell
though
others
put
in
their
word
why
baldwin
if
a
gentleman
ai
ashamed
of
us
why
should
we
be
ashamed
of
him
where
will
ye
get
a
better
asked
another
and
added
he
is
no
stranger
we
seen
him
stop
a
bit
said
the
comic
fireman
what
does
the
dog
say
just
call
him
sir
if
you
please
his
name
is
edward
called
the
kindly
he
came
and
fawned
on
him
then
gravely
snuffed
him
all
round
and
retired
wagging
his
tail
gently
as
much
as
to
say
i
was
rather
taken
by
surprise
at
first
but
on
the
whole
i
see
no
reason
to
recall
my
it
is
all
right
said
the
firemen
in
chorus
and
one
that
had
not
yet
spoken
to
edward
now
whispered
him
mysteriously
ye
see
that
there
dog
he
knows
more
than
we
after
the
dog
a
biped
oracle
at
was
communicated
with
and
late
that
very
night
edward
was
actually
enrolled
a
fireman
and
went
home
warmer
at
heart
than
he
had
been
for
some
time
they
were
all
in
bed
and
when
he
came
down
in
the
morning
julia
was
reading
out
of
the
a
spirited
and
magniloquent
description
of
a
fire
in
southwark
and
of
the
heroism
displayed
by
a
young
gentleman
unknown
but
whose
name
the
writer
hoped
at
so
much
the
line
would
never
be
allowed
to
pass
into
oblivion
and
be
forgotten
in
short
the
paid
him
in
one
column
for
years
of
devotion
now
edward
of
course
was
going
to
relate
his
adventure
but
the
journal
told
it
so
gloriously
he
hesitated
to
say
i
did
all
he
just
sat
and
stared
and
wondered
and
blushed
and
grinned
like
an
imbecile
unfortunately
looks
seldom
escaped
the
doddesses
what
is
that
for
inquired
julia
reproachfully
is
that
sheepish
face
the
thing
to
wear
when
a
sister
is
reading
out
an
heroic
action
ah
these
are
the
things
that
make
one
long
to
be
a
man
to
do
them
what
are
you
thinking
about
dear
well
i
am
thinking
the
is
pitching
it
rather
my
love
what
an
expression
well
then
to
be
honest
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
a
jolly
thing
to
fight
with
fire
and
save
men
lives
and
i
am
glad
you
see
it
in
that
light
for
now
you
will
approve
the
step
i
have
taken
ladies
i
have
put
myself
in
the
way
of
doing
this
sort
of
thing
every
week
of
my
life
i
a
you
are
jesting
i
trust
said
dodd
anxiously
no
mamma
i
got
the
place
late
last
night
and
i
to
enter
on
my
duties
and
put
on
the
livery
next
monday
hurrah
instantly
the
admirers
of
fiery
heroes
at
a
distance
overflowed
with
grief
and
mortification
at
the
prospect
of
one
in
their
own
family
they
could
not
speak
at
all
at
first
and
when
they
did
it
was
only
cruel
cruel
from
julia
and
our
humiliation
is
now
complete
from
dodd
they
soon
dashed
edward
spirits
and
made
him
unhappy
but
they
could
not
convince
him
he
had
done
wrong
however
in
the
heat
of
remonstrance
they
let
out
at
last
that
they
had
just
begun
to
hope
by
dint
of
scissors
and
to
send
him
back
to
oxford
he
also
detected
under
a
cloud
of
tender
loving
soothing
coaxing
and
equivocating
expressions
their
idea
of
a
man
to
wit
a
tall
strong
ornamental
creature
whom
the
women
were
to
cocker
up
and
pet
and
slave
for
and
be
rewarded
by
basking
dead
tired
in
an
imperial
smile
or
two
let
fall
by
their
sovereign
from
his
and
in
fact
good
women
have
often
demoralised
their
idols
down
to
the
dirt
by
this
process
to
be
sure
their
idols
were
sorryish
clay
to
begin
edward
was
anything
but
flowery
so
he
paraded
no
manly
sentiments
in
reply
he
just
bluntly
ridiculed
the
idea
of
his
consenting
to
prey
on
them
and
he
said
humbly
i
know
i
ca
contribute
as
much
to
our
living
as
you
two
can
the
petticoats
carry
the
brains
in
our
family
but
be
a
burden
to
you
not
if
i
know
pride
pride
pride
objected
julia
lifting
her
grand
violet
orbs
like
a
pensive
madonna
and
such
pride
the
pride
that
falls
into
a
suggested
prosaic
mamma
that
is
cutting
said
edward
but
de
notre
siecle
flunkeyism
is
on
the
decline
i
give
you
something
to
put
in
both
your
pipes
and
rank
from
no
condition
rise
act
well
thy
part
in
that
the
honour
lies
yes
yes
said
dodd
only
first
choose
your
part
and
let
your
choice
be
mine
was
hobson
and
he
never
chooses
wrong
come
come
said
he
and
appealed
calmly
to
their
reason
by
which
means
he
made
no
impression
at
all
then
he
happened
to
say
besides
i
must
do
something
i
own
to
you
i
am
more
cast
down
than
i
choose
to
show
mother
i
feel
like
lead
ever
since
she
now
on
this
their
faces
filled
with
sympathy
directly
so
encouraged
he
went
on
to
say
but
when
i
got
my
hand
on
that
old
duffer
collar
and
lowered
him
to
the
ladder
and
the
fire
shot
roaring
out
of
the
window
after
him
too
late
to
eat
him
and
the
crowd
cheered
the
fireman
and
me
i
did
feel
warm
about
the
waistcoat
and
for
the
first
time
this
ever
so
long
life
seemed
not
quite
ended
i
felt
there
was
a
little
bit
of
good
left
that
even
a
poor
dunce
like
me
could
do
and
she
could
approve
if
she
can
look
down
and
see
me
as
i
hope
she
there
there
said
dodd
tearfully
i
am
disarmed
but
my
darling
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
stay
why
edward
surely
i
hope
you
were
not
the
young
gentleman
in
the
paper
the
one
that
risked
his
life
so
nobly
so
foolishly
if
it
was
you
why
mother
did
i
tell
you
it
was
me
said
edward
colouring
no
that
you
did
not
said
julia
was
it
was
it
oh
do
be
quick
and
tell
one
there
it
well
it
was
ah
i
remember
now
that
splendiferous
account
shut
me
up
oh
i
say
did
the
pitch
it
strong
not
at
all
cried
julia
i
believe
every
word
and
ever
so
much
more
mamma
we
have
got
a
hero
and
here
he
is
at
breakfast
with
us
like
an
ordinary
she
rose
suddenly
with
a
burst
of
her
old
fire
and
fell
upon
him
and
kissed
him
and
said
earnestly
how
proud
she
was
of
him
and
so
is
mamma
she
may
say
what
she
proud
of
him
ah
that
i
am
very
proud
and
very
unhappy
are
my
how
often
and
how
earnestly
have
i
prayed
that
my
son
might
not
be
brave
like
his
father
but
stay
quietly
at
home
out
of
here
remonstrance
ended
the
members
of
this
family
happy
by
nature
though
unhappy
by
accident
all
knew
when
to
yield
to
each
other
unfortunately
in
proportion
as
all
these
excitements
great
and
small
died
and
her
life
became
quiet
and
uniform
the
depth
of
julia
wound
showed
itself
more
and
more
she
never
sang
nor
hummed
as
she
used
to
do
going
about
the
house
she
never
laughed
she
did
burst
out
with
fervid
sentiments
now
and
then
but
very
rarely
on
the
whole
a
pensive
languor
took
the
place
of
her
lovely
impetuosity
tears
rushed
in
a
moment
to
her
eyes
with
no
visible
cause
she
often
stole
to
the
window
and
looked
all
up
and
down
the
street
and
when
she
was
out
of
doors
she
looked
down
every
side
street
she
passed
and
sometimes
when
a
quick
light
step
came
behind
them
or
she
saw
a
tall
young
gentleman
at
a
great
distance
her
hand
twitched
her
mother
arm
or
trembled
on
it
and
always
when
they
came
home
she
lingered
a
moment
at
the
and
looked
all
round
before
she
went
in
at
all
these
signs
one
half
of
dodd
heart
used
to
boil
with
indignation
and
the
other
half
melt
with
pity
for
she
saw
her
daughter
was
looking
for
the
indeed
dodd
began
to
fear
she
had
done
unwisely
in
ignoring
the
julia
thoughts
dwelt
on
him
none
the
less
indeed
all
the
more
as
it
seemed
so
the
topic
interdicted
by
tacit
consent
bade
fair
to
become
a
barrier
between
her
and
dodd
hitherto
her
bosom
friend
as
well
as
her
mother
this
was
intolerable
to
poor
dodd
and
at
last
she
said
one
day
my
darling
do
not
be
afraid
of
me
rob
me
of
your
happy
thoughts
if
you
will
but
oh
not
of
your
sad
julia
began
to
cry
directly
oh
no
mamma
she
sobbed
do
not
you
encourage
me
in
my
folly
i
know
i
have
thrown
away
my
affections
on
one
who
i
shall
never
see
him
again
shall
i
mamma
oh
to
think
i
can
say
those
words
and
yet
go
living
dodd
sighed
and
if
you
saw
him
would
that
mend
the
chain
he
has
chosen
to
break
i
do
know
but
if
i
could
only
see
him
to
part
friends
it
is
cruel
to
hate
him
now
he
has
lost
his
sister
and
then
i
have
got
her
message
to
give
him
and
i
want
to
ask
him
why
he
was
afraid
of
me
why
he
could
not
tell
me
he
had
altered
his
mind
did
he
think
i
wanted
to
have
him
against
his
will
oh
mamma
said
she
imploringly
he
seemed
to
love
me
he
seemed
all
truth
i
am
a
poor
unfortunate
dodd
had
only
caresses
to
soothe
her
with
she
could
not
hold
out
any
hopes
one
day
julia
asked
her
timidly
if
she
might
be
a
district
visitor
my
dear
friend
was
and
advised
me
to
be
one
too
but
i
was
wilful
in
those
days
and
chose
to
visit
by
fits
and
starts
and
be
independent
i
am
humbled
now
a
little
may
i
mamma
since
she
died
every
word
of
hers
seems
a
law
to
dodd
assented
cordially
as
she
would
to
anything
else
her
wounded
one
had
proposed
this
project
brought
julia
into
communication
with
the
new
curate
and
who
should
it
prove
to
be
but
hurd
at
sight
of
him
she
turned
white
and
red
and
the
whole
scene
in
the
church
came
back
to
her
but
hurd
showed
considerable
tact
for
so
young
a
man
he
spoke
to
her
in
accents
of
deep
respect
but
confined
his
remarks
strictly
to
the
matter
in
hand
she
told
her
mother
when
she
got
home
and
expressed
her
gratitude
to
hurd
but
said
she
wished
they
did
not
live
in
the
same
parish
with
him
this
feeling
however
wore
off
by
degrees
as
her
duties
brought
her
more
and
more
into
contact
with
him
and
showed
her
his
good
qualities
as
for
hurd
he
saw
and
understood
her
vivid
emotion
at
sight
of
him
saw
and
pitied
not
without
wonder
that
so
beautiful
a
creature
should
have
been
jilted
and
from
the
first
he
marked
his
sense
of
alfred
conduct
by
showing
her
a
profound
and
chivalrous
respect
which
he
did
not
bestow
on
other
young
ladies
in
his
parish
on
the
contrary
he
rather
received
homage
from
them
than
bestowed
it
he
saw
julia
suppress
if
not
hide
her
own
sorrow
and
go
day
by
day
to
comfort
the
poor
and
afflicted
he
admired
and
almost
venerated
her
for
this
he
called
often
on
dodd
and
was
welcome
she
concealed
her
address
for
the
present
from
all
her
friends
except
sampson
but
hurd
had
discovered
her
and
ladies
do
not
snub
the
clergy
moreover
hurd
was
a
gentleman
and
inclined
to
high
church
this
she
liked
he
was
very
too
and
quiet
in
his
manners
above
all
he
seemed
to
be
doing
her
daughter
good
for
julia
and
hurd
had
one
great
sentiment
in
common
when
the
intimacy
had
continued
some
time
on
these
easy
terms
dodd
saw
that
hurd
was
falling
in
love
with
julia
and
that
sort
of
love
warm
but
respectful
which
soon
leads
to
marriage
especially
when
the
lover
is
a
clergyman
this
was
more
than
dodd
bargained
for
she
did
not
want
to
part
with
her
daughter
and
under
other
circumstances
would
have
drawn
in
her
horns
but
hurd
undisguised
homage
gratified
her
maternal
heart
coming
so
soon
after
that
great
insult
to
her
daughter
and
then
she
said
to
herself
at
any
rate
he
will
help
me
cure
her
of
wretch
she
was
not
easy
in
her
mind
though
could
not
tell
what
would
come
of
it
all
so
she
watched
her
daughter
pensive
face
as
only
mothers
watch
and
saw
a
little
of
the
old
peach
bloom
creeping
back
that
was
irresistible
she
let
things
go
their
own
way
and
hoped
for
the
best

the
tenacity
of
a
private
lunatic
asylum
is
unique
a
little
push
behind
your
back
and
you
slide
into
one
but
to
get
out
again
is
to
scale
a
precipice
with
crumbling
sides
alfred
luckier
than
many
had
twice
nearly
escaped
yet
now
he
was
tighter
in
than
ever
his
father
at
first
meant
to
give
him
but
a
year
or
two
of
it
and
let
him
out
on
terms
his
spirit
broken
and
julia
married
but
his
sister
death
was
fatal
to
him
by
hardie
settlement
the
portion
of
any
child
of
hers
dying
a
minor
or
intestate
and
childless
was
to
go
to
the
other
children
so
now
the
prisoner
had
inherited
his
sister
ten
thousand
pounds
and
a
good
slice
of
his
bereaved
enemy
and
father
income
but
this
doubled
his
father
bitterness
that
he
the
unloved
one
should
be
enriched
by
the
death
of
the
adored
one
and
also
tempted
his
cupidity
and
unfortunately
shallow
legislation
conspired
with
that
temptation
for
when
an
englishman
sane
or
insane
is
once
pushed
behind
his
back
into
a
madhouse
those
relatives
who
have
hidden
him
from
the
public
eye
from
the
eye
of
justice
can
grab
hold
of
his
money
behind
his
back
as
they
certified
away
his
wits
behind
his
back
and
can
administer
it
in
the
dark
and
embezzle
it
chanting
but
for
us
the
deranged
would
waste
nor
do
the
monstrous
enactments
which
confer
this
unconstitutional
power
on
subjects
and
shield
its
exercise
from
the
light
and
safeguard
of
publicity
affix
any
penalty
to
the
abuse
of
that
power
if
by
one
chance
in
a
thousand
detected
in
lunacy

extremes
of

the
british
senator
plays
at
satan
and

human
frailty
and
cupidity
beyond
what
they
are
able
to
bear
so
behold
a
son
at
years
of
age
devoted
by
a
father
to
imprisonment
for
life
but
stop
a
minute
the
mad
statutes
which
by
the
threefold
temptation
of
facility
obscurity
and
impurity
insure
the
occasional
incarceration
and
frequent
detention
of
sane
but
moneyed
men
do
provide
though
feebly
for
their
bare
liberation
if
perchance
they
should
not
yield
to
the
loci
and
the
natural
effect
of
confinement
plus
anguish
by
going
mad
or
dying
the
commissioners
of
lunacy
had
power
to
liberate
alfred
in
spite
of
his
relations
and
that
power
you
know
he
had
soberly
but
earnestly
implored
them
to
exercise
after
a
delay
that
seemed
as
strange
to
him
as
postponing
a
hand
to
a
drowning
man
he
received
an
official
letter
from
whitehall
with
bounding
heart
he
broke
the
seal
and
devoured
the
contents
they
ran
thus
sir
by
order
of
the
commissioners
of
lunacy
i
am
directed
to
inform
you
that
they
are
in
the
receipt
of
your
letter
of
the
ultimo
which
will
be
laid
before
the
board
at
their
next
i
am
alfred
was
bitterly
disappointed
at
the
small
advance
he
had
made
however
it
was
a
great
point
to
learn
that
his
letters
were
allowed
to
go
to
the
commissioners
at
all
and
would
be
attended
to
by
degrees
he
waited
and
waited
and
struggled
hard
to
possess
his
soul
in
patience
at
times
his
brain
throbbed
and
his
blood
boiled
and
he
longed
to
kill
the
remorseless
kinless
monsters
who
robbed
him
of
his
liberty
his
rights
as
a
man
and
his
julia
but
he
knew
this
would
not
do
that
what
they
wanted
was
to
gnaw
his
reason
away
and
then
who
could
disprove
that
he
had
always
been
mad
now
he
felt
that
brooding
on
his
wrong
would
infuriate
him
so
he
clenched
his
teeth
and
vowed
a
solemn
vow
that
nothing
should
drive
him
mad
by
advice
of
a
patient
he
wrote
again
to
the
commissioners
begging
for
a
special
commission
to
inquire
into
his
case
and
this
done
with
rare
stoicism
and
wisdom
in
one
so
young
he
actually
sat
down
to
read
hard
for
his
first
class
now
to
do
this
he
wanted
the
ethics
politics
and
rhetoric
of
aristotle
certain
dialogues
of
plato
the
comedies
of
aristophanes
the
historians
demosthenes
lucretius
a
greek
testament
wheeler
analysis
prideaux
horne
and
several
books
of
reference
sacred
and
profane
but
he
could
not
get
these
books
without
wycherley
and
unfortunately
he
had
cut
that
worthy
dead
in
his
own
asylum
the
scornful
dog
had
to
eat
wormwood
pudding
and
humble
pie
he
gulped
these
delicacies
as
he
might
and
wycherley
showed
excellent
qualities
he
entered
into
his
maniac
studies
with
singular
alacrity
supplied
him
with
several
classics
from
his
own
shelves
and
borrowed
the
rest
at
the
london
library
nor
did
his
zeal
stop
there
he
offered
to
read
an
hour
a
day
with
him
and
owned
it
would
afford
him
the
keenest
gratification
to
turn
out
an
oxford
first
classman
from
his
asylum
this
remark
puzzled
alfred
and
set
him
thinking
it
bore
a
subtle
family
resemblance
to
the
observations
he
heard
every
day
from
the
patients
it
was
so
soon
alfred
became
the
doctor
pet
maniac
they
were
often
closeted
together
in
high
discourse
and
indeed
discussed
psychology
metaphysics
and
moral
philosophy
with
indefatigable
zest
long
after
common
sense
would
have
packed
them
both
off
to
bed
the
donkeys
in
fact
they
got
so
thick
that
alfred
thought
it
only
fair
to
say
one
day
mind
doctor
all
these
pleasant
fruitful
hours
we
spend
together
so
sweetly
will
not
prevent
my
indicting
you
for
a
conspiracy
as
soon
as
i
get
out
it
will
rob
the
retribution
of
half
its
relish
ah
my
dear
young
friend
and
said
the
doctor
blandly
let
us
not
sacrifice
the
delights
of
our
profitable
occupation
of
imbibing
the
sweets
of
intellectual
intercourse
to
vague
speculations
as
to
our
future
destiny
during
the
course
of
a
long
and
not
i
trust
altogether
unprofitable
career
it
has
not
unfrequently
been
my
lot
to
find
myself
on
the
verge
of
being
indicted
sued
assassinated
hung
yet
here
i
sit
as
yet
unimmolated
on
the
altar
of
phrenetic
vengeance
this
is
ascribable
to
the
fact
that
my
friends
and
pupils
always
adopt
a
more
favourable
opinion
of
me
long
before
i
part
with
them
and
ere
many
days
and
this
i
divine
by
infallible
indicia
cure
will
commence
in
earnest
and
in
proportion
as
you
progress
to
perfect
restoration
of
the
powers
of
judgment
you
will
grow
in
suspicion
of
the
fact
of
being
under
a
delusion
or
rather
i
should
say
a
very
slight
perversion
and
perturbation
of
the
forces
of
your
admirable
intellect
and
a
proper
subject
for
temporary
seclusion
indeed
this
consciousness
of
insanity
is
the
one
diagnostic
of
sanity
that
never
deceives
me
and
on
the
other
hand
an
obstinate
persistence
in
the
hypothesis
of
perfect
rationality
demonstrates
the
fact
that
insanity
yet
lingers
in
the
convolutions
and
recesses
of
the
brain
and
that
it
would
not
be
humane
as
yet
to
cast
the
patient
on
a
world
in
which
he
would
inevitably
be
taken
some
ungenerous
advantage
alfred
ventured
to
inquire
whether
this
was
not
rather
paradoxical
certainly
said
the
ready
doctor
and
paradoxicality
is
an
indicial
characteristic
of
truth
in
all
matters
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
that
rational
said
the
maniac
very
drily
one
afternoon
grinding
hard
for
his
degree
he
was
invited
downstairs
to
see
two
visitors
at
that
word
he
found
out
how
prison
tries
the
nerves
he
trembled
with
hope
and
fear
it
was
but
for
a
moment
he
bathed
his
face
and
hands
to
compose
himself
made
his
toilet
carefully
and
went
into
the
all
on
his
guard
there
he
found
wycherley
and
two
gentlemen
one
was
an
the
other
an
who
had
consented
to
resign
feelessness
and
brieflessness
for
a
snug
a
year
at
whitehall
after
a
momentary
greeting
they
continued
the
conversation
with
wycherley
and
scarcely
noticed
alfred
they
were
there
forma
a
plausible
lunatic
had
pestered
the
board
and
extorted
a
visit
of
ceremony
alfred
blood
boiled
but
he
knew
it
must
not
boil
over
he
contrived
to
throw
a
short
pertinent
remark
in
every
now
and
then
this
being
done
politely
told
and
at
last
eskell
commissioner
of
lunacy
smiled
and
turned
to
him
allow
me
to
put
a
few
questions
to
the
more
the
better
sir
said
alfred
eskell
then
asked
him
to
describe
minutely
and
in
order
all
he
had
done
since
seven
that
day
and
he
did
it
examined
him
in
the
multiplication
table
and
he
did
it
and
while
he
was
applying
these
tests
wycherley
face
wore
an
expression
of
pity
that
was
truly
comical
now
this
eskell
had
an
itch
for
the
classics
so
he
went
on
to
say
you
have
been
a
scholar
i
i
am
not
old
enough
to
be
a
scholar
sir
said
alfred
but
i
am
a
well
well
now
can
you
tell
me
what
follows
this
line
jusque
datum
sceleri
canimus
populuinque
potentem
why
not
at
the
oh
surely
you
can
said
eskell
ironically
it
is
in
a
tolerably
passage
come
well
i
said
alfred
sneering
secretly
let
me
see
mum
mum
populumque
potentem
in
sua
victrici
conversum
viscera
dextra
quite
right
now
go
on
if
you
alfred
who
was
playing
with
his
examiner
all
this
time
pretended
to
cudgel
his
brains
then
went
on
and
warmed
involuntarily
with
the
lines
cognatasque
acies
et
rupto
foedere
regni
certatum
totis
concussi
viribus
orbis
in
commune
nefas
infestis
que
obvia
signis
signa
pares
aquilas
et
pila
minantia
he
seems
to
have
a
good
memory
said
the
examiner
rather
taken
aback
oh
that
is
nothing
for
him
observed
wycherley
he
has
horace
all
by
heart
you
wonder
and
mouths
out
homer
greek
like
the
great
faculty
of
memory
thus
tested
eskell
proceeded
to
a
greater
judgment
spirited
lines
those
yes
sir
but
surely
rather
tumid
whole
of
the
shaken
globe
but
little
poets
love
big
i
see
you
agree
with
horace
that
so
great
a
work
as
an
epic
poem
should
open
modestly
with
an
no
sir
said
alfred
i
think
that
rather
an
arbitrary
and
peevish
canon
of
friend
horace
the
aeneid
you
know
begins
just
as
he
says
an
epic
ought
not
to
begin
and
the
aeneid
is
the
greatest
latin
epic
in
the
next
place
the
use
of
modesty
is
to
keep
a
man
from
writing
an
epic
poem
at
all
but
if
he
will
have
that
impudence
why
then
he
had
better
have
the
courage
to
plunge
into
the
castalian
stream
like
virgil
and
lucan
not
crawl
in
funking
and
holding
on
by
the
muse
but
excuse
me
quorsum
haec
tam
putida
tendunt
what
have
the
latin
poets
to
do
with
this
modern
sanity
or
insanity
abbott
snorted
contemptuously
in
support
of
the
query
but
eskell
smiled
and
said
continue
to
answer
me
as
intelligently
and
you
may
find
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
alfred
took
this
hint
and
said
artfully
mine
was
a
thoughtless
remark
of
course
a
gentleman
of
your
experience
can
test
the
mind
on
any
subject
however
he
added
piteously
still
if
you
would
but
leave
the
poets
who
are
all
half
crazy
themselves
and
examine
me
in
the
philosophers
of
antiquity
surely
it
would
be
a
higher
wycherley
explained
in
a
patronising
whisper
he
labours
under
an
abnormal
contempt
for
poetry
dating
from
his
attack
previously
to
that
he
actually
obtained
a
prize
poem
well
doctor
and
after
that
am
i
wrong
to
despise
poetry
they
might
have
comprehended
this
on
paper
but
spoken
it
was
too
keen
for
them
all
three
the
visitors
stared
wycherley
came
to
their
aid
you
might
examine
my
young
friend
for
hours
and
not
detect
the
one
crevice
in
the
brilliancy
of
his
intellectual
the
maniac
made
a
face
as
one
that
drinketh
verjuice
suddenly
for
pity
sake
doctor
do
be
so
inaccurate
say
a
spot
on
the
brilliancy
or
a
crevice
in
the
armour
but
not
a
crevice
in
the
brilliancy
my
good
friend
here
gentlemen
deals
in
conjectural
certificates
and
broken
metaphors
he
dislocates
more
tropes
to
my
sorrow
than
even
his
friend
shakespeare
whom
he
thinks
a
greater
philosopher
than
aristotle
and
who
calls
the
murder
of
an
individual
sleeper
the
murder
of
sleep
confounding
the
concrete
with
the
abstract
and
then
talks
of
taking
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
query
a
cork
jacket
and
a
flask
of
brandy
well
hardie
said
eskell
rather
feebly
let
me
tell
you
those
passages
which
so
shock
your
notions
are
among
the
most
very
likely
sir
retorted
the
maniac
whose
logic
was
up
but
applauded
only
in
a
nation
where
the
clap
their
hands
every
sunday
morning
and
we
all
pray
for
peace
giving
as
our
exquisite
reason
that
we
have
got
the
god
of
hosts
on
our
side
in
abbott
the
other
commissioner
had
endured
all
this
chat
with
an
air
of
weary
indifference
he
now
said
to
wycherley
i
wish
to
put
to
you
a
question
or
two
in
alfred
was
horribly
frightened
this
was
the
very
dodge
that
had
ruined
him
at
silverton
house
oh
no
gentlemen
he
cried
imploringly
let
me
have
fair
play
you
have
given
me
no
secret
audience
then
why
give
my
accuser
one
i
am
charged
with
a
single
delusion
for
mercy
sake
go
to
the
point
at
once
and
examine
me
on
that
now
you
talk
sense
said
abbott
as
if
the
previous
topics
had
been
chosen
by
alfred
but
that
will
excite
him
objected
eskell
it
always
does
excite
it
excites
the
insane
but
not
the
sane
said
alfred
so
there
is
another
test
you
will
observe
whether
it
excites
then
before
they
could
interrupt
him
he
glided
on
the
supposed
hallucination
is
this
i
strongly
suspect
my
father
a
bankrupt
and
therefore
dishonest
banker
of
having
somehow
misappropriated
a
sum
of
fourteen
thousand
pounds
which
sum
is
known
to
have
been
brought
from
india
by
one
captain
dodd
and
has
stop
a
minute
said
abbott
who
knows
it
besides
you
the
whole
family
of
the
dodds
they
will
show
you
his
letter
from
india
announcing
his
return
with
the
where
do
they
live
albion
villa
abbott
noted
the
address
in
his
book
and
alfred
mightily
cheered
and
encouraged
by
this
sensible
act
went
on
to
describe
the
various
indications
which
insufficient
singly
had
by
their
united
force
driven
him
to
his
conclusion
when
he
described
david
appearance
and
words
on
his
father
lawn
at
night
wycherley
interrupted
him
quietly
are
you
quite
sure
this
was
not
a
vision
a
phantom
of
the
mind
heated
by
your
agitation
and
your
suspicions
eskell
nodded
assent
knowing
nothing
about
the
matter
pray
doctor
was
i
the
only
person
who
saw
this
vision
inquired
alfred
slily
i
conclude
so
said
wycherley
with
an
admirable
smile
but
why
do
you
conclude
so
because
you
are
one
of
those
who
reason
in
a
circle
of
assumptions
now
it
happens
that
captain
dodd
was
seen
and
felt
on
that
occasion
by
three
persons
besides
name
them
said
abbott
sharply
a
policeman
called
reynolds
another
policeman
whose
name
i
know
and
miss
julia
dodd
the
policemen
helped
me
lift
captain
dodd
off
the
grass
sir
julia
met
us
chose
by
and
we
four
carried
wycherhey
phantom
home
together
to
albion
abbott
noted
down
all
the
names
and
then
turned
to
wycherley
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
say
it
is
a
very
important
statement
said
the
doctor
blandly
and
that
i
am
sure
my
young
friend
would
not
advance
it
unless
he
was
firmly
persuaded
of
its
much
obliged
doctor
and
you
would
not
contradict
me
so
rashly
in
a
matter
i
know
all
about
and
you
know
nothing
about
if
it
was
not
your
fixed
habit
to
found
facts
on
theories
instead
of
theories
on
there
that
is
enough
said
abbott
i
have
brought
you
both
to
an
issue
at
last
i
shall
send
to
barkington
and
examine
the
policemen
and
the
oh
thank
you
sir
cried
alfred
with
emotion
if
you
once
apply
genuine
tests
like
that
to
my
case
i
shall
not
be
long
in
prison
said
wycherley
reproachfully
have
you
any
complaint
then
to
make
of
your
treatment
here
inquired
eskell
no
no
sir
said
alfred
warmly
dr
wycherley
is
the
very
soul
of
humanity
here
are
no
tortures
no
handcuffs
nor
no
brutality
no
insects
that
murder
sleep
without
offence
to
logic
in
my
last
asylum
the
attendants
inflicted
violence
here
they
are
only
allowed
to
endure
it
and
gentlemen
i
must
tell
you
a
noble
trait
in
my
enemy
there
nothing
can
make
him
angry
with
madmen
their
lies
their
groundless
and
narrow
suspicions
of
him
their
deplorable
ingratitude
to
him
of
which
i
see
examples
every
day
that
rile
me
on
his
account
all
these
things
seem
to
glide
off
him
baffled
by
the
infinite
kindness
of
his
heart
and
the
incomparable
sweetness
of
his
temper
and
he
returns
the
duffers
good
for
evil
with
scarcely
an
at
this
unexpected
tribute
the
water
stood
in
the
doctor
eyes
it
was
no
more
than
the
truth
but
this
was
the
first
maniac
he
had
met
intelligent
enough
to
see
his
good
qualities
clearly
and
express
them
eloquently
in
short
continued
alfred
to
be
happy
in
his
house
all
a
man
wants
is
to
be
insane
but
as
i
am
not
insane
i
am
miserable
no
convict
no
galley
slave
is
so
wretched
as
i
am
gentlemen
and
what
is
my
crime
well
well
said
eskell
kindly
i
think
it
likely
you
will
not
be
very
long
in
they
then
civilly
dismissed
him
and
on
his
departure
asked
wycherley
his
candid
opinion
wycherley
said
he
was
now
nearly
cured
his
ability
to
discuss
his
delusion
without
excitement
was
of
itself
a
proof
of
that
but
in
another
month
he
would
be
better
still
the
doctor
concluded
his
remarks
thus
however
gentlemen
you
have
heard
him
now
judge
for
yourselves
whether
anybody
can
be
as
clever
as
he
is
without
the
presence
of
more
or
less
abnormal
excitement
of
the
organs
of
it
was
a
bright
day
for
alfred
he
saw
he
had
made
an
excellent
impression
on
the
commissioners
and
as
luck
does
not
always
come
single
after
many
vain
attempts
to
get
a
letter
posted
to
julia
he
found
this
very
afternoon
a
nurse
was
going
away
next
day
he
offered
her
a
guinea
and
she
agreed
to
post
a
letter
oh
the
hapiness
it
was
to
the
poor
prisoner
to
write
it
and
unburden
his
heart
and
tell
his
wrongs
he
kept
his
manhood
for
his
enemies
his
tears
fell
on
the
paper
he
sent
to
his
forlorn
bride
he
had
no
misgivings
of
her
truth
he
judged
her
by
himself
gave
her
credit
for
anxiety
but
not
for
doubt
he
concluded
a
long
ardent
tender
letter
by
begging
her
to
come
and
see
him
and
if
refused
admission
to
publish
his
case
in
the
newspapers
and
employ
a
lawyer
to
proceed
against
all
the
parties
concerned
in
his
detention
day
after
day
he
waited
for
an
answer
to
his
letter
none
came
then
he
began
to
be
sore
perplexed
and
torn
with
agonising
doubts
what
if
her
mind
was
poisoned
too
what
if
she
thought
him
mad
what
if
some
misfortune
had
befallen
her
what
if
she
had
believed
him
dead
and
her
heart
had
broken
hitherto
he
had
seen
his
own
trouble
chiefly
but
now
he
began
to
think
day
and
night
on
hers
and
though
he
ground
on
for
his
degree
not
to
waste
time
and
not
to
be
driven
mad
yet
it
was
almost
superhuman
labour
sighs
issued
from
his
labouring
breast
while
his
hard
indomitable
brain
laboured
away
all
uphill
at
aristotle
divisions
and
definitions
on
the
seventh
day
the
earliest
the
mad
statute
allowed
the
two
commissioners
returned
and
this
time
abbott
took
the
lead
and
told
him
that
the
policeman
reynolds
had
left
the
force
and
the
dodds
had
left
the
town
and
were
in
london
but
their
address
not
known
at
this
alfred
was
much
agitated
she
was
alive
and
perhaps
near
him
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
of
your
story
said
abbott
and
coupling
it
with
what
we
have
seen
of
you
we
think
your
relatives
have
treated
you
and
a
young
lady
of
whom
everybody
speaks
with
respect
god
bless
you
for
saying
that
god
bless
you
treated
you
both
i
say
with
needless
eskell
then
told
him
the
result
of
the
special
commission
now
closed
i
believe
you
to
be
cured
said
he
and
abbott
has
some
doubts
whether
you
were
ever
positively
insane
we
shall
lay
your
case
before
the
board
at
once
and
the
board
will
write
to
the
party
who
signed
the
order
and
propose
to
him
to
discharge
you
at
at
this
magnificent
project
alfred
countenance
fell
and
he
stared
with
astonishment
what
have
you
not
the
power
to
do
me
justice
without
soliciting
injustice
to
help
you
the
board
has
the
power
said
eskell
but
for
many
reasons
they
exercise
it
with
prudence
and
reserve
besides
it
is
only
fair
to
those
who
have
signed
the
order
to
give
them
the
graceful
office
of
liberating
the
patient
it
paves
the
way
to
alfred
sighed
the
commissioners
to
keep
up
his
heart
promised
to
send
him
copies
of
their
correspondence
with
the
person
who
had
signed
the
order
then
said
abbott
kindly
you
will
see
your
case
is
not
being
the
following
precis
though
imperfect
will
give
some
idea
of
the
correspondence
the
board
wrote
to
thomas
hardie
letting
him
know
the
result
of
the
special
commission
and
requesting
him
to
discharge
his
nephew
thomas
quaked
richard
smiled
and
advised
thomas
to
take
no
notice
by
this
a
week
was
gained
to
injustice
and
lost
to
justice
the
board
pointed
out
thomas
hardie
inadvertence
in
not
answering
no
enclosed
copy
of
it
and
pressed
for
a
reply
thomas
quaked
richard
smiled
thomas
hardie
to
the
board
from
what
he
had
heard
it
would
be
premature
to
discharge
alfred
should
prefer
to
wait
a
month
or
two
board
to
alfred
conveying
this
in
other
terms
alfred
to
board
warning
them
against
this
proposal
to
postpone
justice
was
to
refuse
justice
certainly
for
a
time
probably
for
ever
the
board
to
thomas
hardie
suggesting
that
if
not
released
immediately
alfred
ought
to
have
a
trial
be
allowed
to
go
into
the
world
with
a
keeper
alfred
to
the
board
begging
that
sampson
an
honest
independent
physician
might
be
allowed
to
visit
him
and
report
to
them
the
board
to
alfred
declining
this
for
the
present
as
unadvisable
they
being
in
correspondence
with
the
person
who
had
signed
the
order
with
a
view
to
his
liberation
hardie
to
the
board
shuffling
and
requesting
time
to
make
further
inquiries
the
board
suggesting
there
should
be
some
reasonable
limit
to
delay
hardie
asking
for
a
month
to
see
about
it
the
board
suggesting
a
week
alfred
hardie
asking
permission
to
be
visited
by
a
solicitor
with
a
view
to
protection
of
his
liberty
and
property
the
board
declining
this
pending
their
correspondence
with
other
parties
but
asking
him
for
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
his
trustees
thomas
hardie
informing
the
board
he
had
now
learned
alfred
had
threatened
to
kill
his
father
as
soon
as
ever
he
should
get
out
and
leaving
the
board
to
discharge
him
on
their
own
responsibility
if
they
chose
after
this
warning
but
declining
peremptorily
to
do
so
himself
the
board
by
advice
of
abbott
to
alfred
trustees
warning
them
against
any
alienation
of
alfred
money
under
the
notion
that
he
was
legally
a
lunatic
and
saying
that
a
public
inquiry
appeared
inevitable
owing
to
hardie
unwillingness
to
enter
into
their
views
to
alfred
inquiring
whether
he
wished
to
encounter
the
expense
of
chancery
proceedings
to
establish
his
sanity
alfred
to
the
board
imploring
them
to
use
their
powers
and
discharge
him
without
further
delay
and
assuring
them
he
meditated
no
violence
on
his
liberation
but
should
proceed
against
all
parties
under
legal
advice
the
board
to
hardie
warning
him
that
he
must
in
future
pay
alfred
maintenance
in
asylum
out
of
his
own
pocket
and
pressing
him
either
to
discharge
the
young
man
or
else
to
apply
to
the
lord
chancellor
for
a
commission
de
lunatico
inquirendo
and
enclosing
copy
of
a
letter
from
wycherley
saying
the
patient
was
harmless
hardie
respectfully
declining
to
do
either
but
reminding
the
commissioners
that
the
matter
could
be
thrown
into
chancery
without
his
consent
only
the
expense
which
would
be
tremendous
would
fall
on
the
lunatic
estate
which
might
hereafter
be
regretted
by
the
party
himself
he
concluded
by
promising
to
come
to
town
and
visit
alfred
with
his
family
physician
and
write
further
in
a
week
having
thus
thrown
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
board
thomas
hardie
and
richard
consulted
with
a
notoriously
unscrupulous
madhouse
keeper
in
the
suburbs
of
london
and
effected
a
masterstroke
whereof
anon
the
correspondence
had
already
occupied
three
months
and
kept
alfred
in
a
fever
of
the
mind
of
all
the
maddening
things
with
which
he
had
been
harassed
by
the
pretended
curers
of
insanity
this
tried
him
hardest
to
see
a
dozen
honest
gentlemen
wishing
to
do
justice
able
to
do
justice
by
one
manly
stroke
of
the
pen
yet
forego
their
and
descend
to
coax
an
able
rogue
to
do
their
duty
and
undo
his
own
interest
and
rascality
to
see
a
strong
cause
turned
into
a
weak
one
by
the
timidity
of
champions
clad
by
law
in
complete
steel
and
a
rotten
cause
against
which
law
and
power
as
well
as
truth
justice
and
common
sense
had
now
declared
turned
into
a
strong
one
by
the
pluck
and
cunning
of
his
one
unarmed
enemy
the
ancients
feigned
that
the
ingenious
gods
tortured
tantalus
in
hell
by
thirst
and
water
flowing
to
just
the
outside
of
his
lips
a
briton
can
thirst
for
liberty
as
hard
as
tantalus
or
hunted
deer
can
thirst
for
cooling
springs
and
this
correspondence
brought
liberty
and
citizenhood
and
love
and
happiness
to
the
lips
of
alfred
burning
pining
aching
heart
again
and
again
and
again
then
carried
them
away
from
him
in
mockery
oh
the
sickening
anguish
of
hope
deferred
and
deferred
the
hell
it
is
in
suing
long
to
but
indeed
his
hopes
began
to
sicken
for
good
when
he
found
that
the
board
would
not
allow
any
honest
independent
physician
to
visit
him
or
any
solicitor
to
see
him
at
first
indeed
they
refused
it
because
thomas
hardie
was
going
to
let
him
out
but
when
hardie
would
not
move
at
their
request
then
on
a
fresh
application
they
refused
it
giving
as
their
reason
that
they
had
already
refused
it
yet
in
so
keen
a
battle
he
would
not
throw
away
a
chance
so
he
determined
to
win
wycherley
altogether
by
hook
or
by
crook
and
get
a
certificate
of
sanity
from
him
now
a

knew
would
do
the
trick
he
had
only
to
say
that
hamlet
was
mad
and
hamlet
was
mad
is
easily
said
wycherley
was
a
collector
of
mad
people
and
collectors
are
always
amateurs
and
very
seldom
connoisseurs
his
turn
of
mind
with
his
interests
led
him
to
put
down
any
man
a
lunatic
whose
intellect
was
manifestly
superior
to
his
own
alfred
hardie
and
one
or
two
more
contemporaries
had
suffered
by
this
humour
of
the
good
doctor
nor
did
the
dead
escape
him
entirely
pascal
according
to
wycherley
was
a
madman
with
an
illusion
about
a
precipice
john
howard
a
moral
lunatic
in
whom
the
affections
were
reversed
saul
a

maniac
with
homicidal
paroxysms
and

paul
an
incoherent

who
in
his

flies
off
at
a
tangent
and

admits
having

alluded

one
sees
more
devils
than
vast
hell
can
hold
that
is
the
but
without
intending
any
disrespect
to
any
of
these
gentlemen
he
assigned
the
golden
crown
of
insanity
to
hamlet
to
be
sure
this
character
tells
his
friends
in
the
play
he
shall
insanity
and
swears
them
not
to
reveal
the
reason
and
after
this
hint
to
his
friends
and
the
pit
it
is
notorious
he
was
not
written
for
readers
he
keeps
his
word
and
does
it
as
cleverly
as
if
his
name
was
david
or
brutus
instead
of
hamlet
indeed
like
edgar
he
rather
overdoes
it
and
so
puzzles
his
enemies
in
the
play
and
certain
german
criticasters
and
english
mad
doctors
in
the
closet
and
does
not
puzzle
his
bosom
friend
in
the
play
one
bit
nor
the
pit
for
whom
he
was
created
add
to
this
his
sensibility
and
his
kindness
to
others
and
his
eloquent
grief
at
the
situation
which
his
father
and
mother
son
was
placed
in
and
had
brains
to
realise
though
his
psychological
critics
it
seems
have
not
and
add
to
all
that
the
prodigious
extent
of
his
mind
his
keen
observation
his
deep
reflection
his
brilliant
fancy
united
for
once
in
a
way
with
the
great
academic
or
judicial
intellect
that
looks
down
and
sees
all
the
sides
of
everything
and
what
can
this
rare
intellectual
compound
be
wycherley
decided
the
question
hamlet
was
too
much
greater
in
the
world
of
mind
than
coleridge
and
his
german
criticasters
too
much
higher
deeper
and
broader
than
esquirol
pinel
sauze
haslam
munro
pagan
wigan
prichard
romberg
wycherley
and
such
small
deer
to
be
anything
less
than
a
madman
now
in
their
midnight
discussions
wycherley
more
than
once
alluded
to
the
insanity
of
hamlet
and
offered
proofs
but
alfred
declined
the
subject
as
too
puerile
a
man
must
exist
before
he
can
be
insane
said
the
oxonian
philosopher
severe
in
youthful
gravity
but
when
he
found
that
wycherley
had
he
lived
in
denmark
at
the
time
would
have
conferred
cannily
with
hamlet
uncle
removed
that
worthy
disbelief
in
hamlet
insanity
and
signed
the
young
gentleman
away
behind
his
back
into
a
lunatic
asylum
alfred
began
to
sympathise
with
this
posthumous
victim
of
psychological
science
i
believe
the
bloke
was
no
madder
than
i
am
said
he
he
got
the
play
studied
it
afresh
compared
the
fiction
with
the
legend
compared
hamlet
humbugging
his
enemies
and
their
tool
ophelia
with
hamlet
opening
his
real
mind
to
himself
or
his
horatio
the
very
next
moment
contrasted
the
real
madness
the
author
has
portrayed
in
the
plays
of
hamlet
and
lear
by
the
side
of
these
extravagant
imitations
to
save
if
possible
even
dunces
and
dreamers
and
criticasters
from
being
taken
in
by
the
latter
and
at
their
next
seance
pitched
into
the
doctor
pet
chimera
and
what
with
logic
fact
ridicule
and
the
author
lines
knocked
it
to
atoms
now
in
their
midnight
discussions
wycherley
had
always
handled
the
question
of
alfred
hardie
sanity
or
insanity
with
a
philosophical
coolness
the
young
man
admired
and
found
it
hard
to
emulate
but
this
philosophic
calmness
deserted
him
the
moment
hamlet
insanity
was
disputed
and
the
harder
he
was
pressed
the
angrier
the
louder
the
more
confused
the
psychological
physician
became
and
presently
he
got
furious
burst
out
of
the
or
style
and
called
alfred
a
d
d
ungrateful
insolent
puppy
and
went
stamping
about
the
room
and
finally
to
the
young
man
horror
fell
down
in
a
fit
of
an
epileptic
character
grinding
his
teeth
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
alfred
was
filled
with
regret
and
though
alarmed
had
the
presence
of
mind
not
to
call
for
assistance
the
fit
was
a
very
mild
one
in
reality
though
horrible
to
look
at
the
doctor
came
to
and
asked
feebly
for
wine
alfred
got
it
him
and
the
doctor
with
a
mixture
of
cunning
and
alarm
in
his
eye
said
he
had
fainted
away
or
nearly
alfred
assented
coaxingly
and
looked
sheepish
after
this
he
took
care
never
to
libel
hamlet
intellect
again
by
denying
his
insanity
for
he
was
now
convinced
of
what
he
had
long
half
suspected
that
the
doctor
had
a
bee
in
his
own
bonnet
and
alfred
had
studied
true
insanity
all
this
time
and
knew
how
inhumane
it
is
to
oppose
a
monomaniac
foible
it
only
infuriates
and
worries
him
no
power
can
convince
him
but
now
he
resolved
to
play
on
the
doctor
foible
it
went
against
his
conscience
but
the
temptation
was
so
strong
he
came
to
him
with
a
air
doctor
said
he
i
have
been
thinking
over
your
arguments
and
i
capitulate
if
hamlet
ever
existed
he
was
as
mad
as
a
march
and
he
blushed
at
this
his
first
quibble
wycherley
beamed
with
satisfaction
my
young
friend
this
gives
me
sincere
pleasure
not
on
my
account
but
on
your
own
there
goes
one
of
your
illusions
then
now
tell
me
the
have
you
calmly
reconsidered
that
too
alfred
hung
his
head
and
looked
guiltier
and
guiltier
why
said
he
that
never
amounted
to
anything
more
than
a
strong
suspicion
it
has
long
ceased
to
occupy
my
mind
in
excess
however
should
i
ever
be
so
fortunate
as
to
recover
my
liberty
i
have
no
objection
to
collect
the
evidence
about
it
pro
and
and
then
make
you
the
judge
instead
of
this
he
delivered
with
an
admirable
appearance
of
indifference
very
well
sir
said
the
doctor
drily
then
now
i
have
a
piece
of
good
news
for
oh
doctor
what
is
that
your
cure
is
complete
that
is
all
you
are
now
a
sane
man
as
sane
as
i
alfred
was
a
little
disappointed
at
this
piece
of
news
but
recovering
himself
asked
him
to
certify
that
and
let
him
send
the
certificate
to
the
board
wycherley
said
he
would
with
pleasure
i
bring
it
to
you
when
i
make
my
round
said
he
alfred
retired
triumphant
and
went
in
at
plato
with
a
good
heart
in
about
an
hour
wycherley
paid
him
the
promised
visit
but
what
may
not
an
hour
bring
forth
he
came
with
mortification
and
regret
in
his
face
to
tell
alfred
that
an
order
of
transfer
had
been
signed
by
the
proper
parties
and
by
two
commissioners
and
he
was
to
go
to
wolf
asylum
that
day
alfred
groaned
i
knew
my
father
would
my
feeble
friends
somehow
or
other
said
he
what
is
his
game
do
you
know
i
suppose
to
obtain
a
delay
and
meantime
get
you
into
an
asylum
where
they
will
tell
the
commissioners
you
are
worse
again
and
perhaps
do
something
to
make
their
words
good
wolf
between
ourselves
will
say
or
do
almost
anything
for
money
and
his
asylum
is
conducted
on
the
old
system
though
he
pretends
my
dear
friend
said
alfred
will
you
do
me
a
favour
how
could
i
deny
you
anything
at
this
sorrowful
moment
here
is
an
advertisement
i
want
inserted
in
the
oh
i
ca
do
that
i
look
at
it
before
you
break
my
heart
by
refusing
wycherley
looked
at
it
and
said
it
was
innocent
being
unintelligible
and
he
would
insert
it
himself
three
insertions
dear
doctor
said
alfred
here
is
the
money
the
doctor
then
told
him
sorrowfully
he
must
pack
up
his
things
wolf
keepers
were
waiting
for
him
the
moment
of
parting
came
then
alfred
solemnly
forgave
wycherley
for
signing
away
his
wits
and
thanked
him
for
all
his
kindness
and
humanity
we
shall
never
meet
again
i
fear
said
he
i
feel
a
weight
of
foreboding
here
about
my
heart
i
never
felt
before
yet
my
trials
have
been
many
and
great
i
think
the
end
is
at
keepers
received
him
and
their
first
act
was
to
handcuff
him
the
cold
steel
struck
into
him
deeper
than
his
wrist
and
reminded
him
of
silverton
grove
he
could
not
suppress
a
shudder
the
carriage
rolled
all
through
london
with
him
he
saw
the
parks
with
autumn
brown
and
golden
tints
he
saw
the
people
some
rich
some
poor
but
none
of
them
prisoners
he
saw
a
little
girl
all
rags
oh
if
i
could
be
as
ragged
as
you
are
he
said
and
at
last
they
reached
drayton
house
a
huge
old
mansion
fortified
into
a
jail
his
handcuffs
were
whipped
off
in
the
yard
he
was
ushered
into
a
large
gloomy
wolf
soon
came
to
him
and
they
measured
each
other
by
the
eye
like
two
wolf
eye
fell
under
alfred
and
the
latter
felt
he
was
capable
of
much
foul
play
he
was
one
of
the
old
breed
and
contained
the
and
the
spaniel
in
his
single
nature
i
hope
you
will
be
comfortable
here
sir
said
he
doggedly
i
will
try
the
patients
dine
in
half
an
i
will
be
ready
full
dress
in
the
evening
there
are
several
alfred
assented
by
a
bow
wolf
rang
a
bell
and
told
a
servant
to
show
hardie
his
room
he
had
just
time
to
make
his
toilet
when
the
bell
rang
for
dinner
as
he
went
down
a
nurse
met
him
held
up
something
white
to
him
as
she
came
lowered
it
quickly
and
dropped
it
at
his
feet
in
passing
it
was
a
it
was
twisted
into
a
pretty
shape
scented
and
addressed
to
hardie
in
a
delicate
italian
hand
and
in
that
pale
ink
which
seems
to
reflect
the
charming
timidity
of
the
fair
who
use
it
he
wondered
carried
it
into
a
recess
then
opened
it
and
read
it
it
contained
but
this
one
line
drink
nothing
but
water
at
these
words
in
that
delicate
italian
hand
sent
a
chill
through
alfred
what
on
earth
was
all
this
was
he
to
be
poisoned
was
his
life
aimed
at
now
instead
of
his
reason
what
was
this
mysterious
drama
prepared
for
him
the
very
moment
he
set
his
foot
in
the
place
perhaps
before
a
poisoner
and
a
friend
both
strangers
he
went
down
to
dinner
and
contrived
to
examine
every
lady
and
gentleman
at
the
table
but
they
were
all
strangers
presently
a
servant
filled
his
glass
with
beer
he
looked
and
saw
it
was
poured
from
a
small
jug
holding
only
his
portion
alfred
took
his
ring
off
his
finger
and
holding
the
glass
up
dropped
his
ring
in
what
is
that
for
inquired
one
or
two
oh
my
ring
has
a
peculiar
virtue
it
tells
me
what
is
good
for
me
ah
what
do
i
see
my
ruby
changes
colour
fetch
me
a
clean
and
he
filled
it
with
water
from
a
caraffe
no
sir
leave
the
beer
analyse
it
in
my
room
after
dinner
i
a
wolf
changed
colour
and
was
ill
at
ease
here
was
a
bold
and
ugly
customer
however
he
said
nothing
and
felt
sure
his
morphia
could
not
be
detected
in
beer
by
any
decomposer
but
the
stomach
still
he
was
rather
mystified
in
the
evening
alfred
came
dressed
into
the
and
found
several
gentlemen
and
ladies
there
one
of
the
ladies
seemed
to
attract
the
lion
share
of
male
homage
her
back
was
turned
to
alfred
but
it
was
a
beautiful
back
with
great
magnificent
neck
and
shoulders
and
a
skin
like
satin
she
was
tall
but
rounded
and
symmetrical
had
a
massive
but
long
and
shapely
white
arm
and
perfect
hand
and
masses
of
thick
black
hair
sat
on
her
grand
white
poll
like
a
raven
on
a
marble
pillar
it
was
not
easy
to
get
near
her
for
the
mad
gentlemen
were
fawning
on
her
all
round
like
queen
elizabeth
courtiers
however
wolf
seeing
alfred
standing
alone
said
let
me
introduce
you
and
took
him
round
to
her
the
courtiers
fell
back
a
little
the
lady
turned
her
stately
head
and
her
dark
eyes
ran
lightly
all
over
alfred
in
a
moment
he
bowed
and
blushed
like
a
girl
she
curtseyed
composedly
and
without
a
symptom
of
recognition
deep
water
runs
still
and
wolf
introduced
them
ceremoniously
mr
hardie
chapter
xli
on
alfred
leaving
silverton
archbold
was
prostrated
it
was
a
stunning
blow
to
her
young
passion
and
left
her
weary
desolate
but
she
was
too
strong
to
lie
helpless
under
disappointed
longings
two
days
she
sat
stupefied
with
the
heartache
after
that
she
bustled
about
her
work
in
a
fervour
of
restlessness
and
ungovernable
irritability
quenched
at
times
by
fits
of
weeping
as
she
wept
apart
but
raged
and
tyrannised
in
public
she
soon
made
silverton
house
silverton
oven
especially
to
those
who
had
the
luck
to
be
of
her
sex
then
baker
timidly
remonstrated
at
the
first
word
she
snapped
him
up
and
said
a
change
would
be
good
for
both
of
them
he
apologised
in
vain
that
very
day
she
closed
by
letter
with
wolf
who
had
often
invited
her
to
be
his
her
motive
half
hidden
from
herself
was
to
be
anywhere
near
her
favourite
installed
at
drayton
house
she
waited
some
days
and
coquetted
with
her
own
desires
then
dressed
neatly
but
soberly
and
called
at
wycherley
sent
in
a
note
explaining
who
she
was
with
a
bit
of
soft
sawder
and
asked
to
see
alfred
she
was
politely
but
peremptorily
refused
she
felt
this
rebuff
bitterly
she
went
home
stung
and
tingling
to
the
core
but
bitters
wholesome
be
offended
pride
now
allied
with
strong
good
sense
to
wither
a
wild
affection
and
as
it
was
no
longer
fed
by
the
presence
of
its
object
her
wound
healed
all
but
the
occasional
dull
throbbing
that
precedes
a
perfect
cure
at
this
stage
of
her
convalescence
wolf
told
her
in
an
way
that
hardie
a
patient
of
doubtful
insanity
was
coming
to
his
asylum
to
be
kept
there
by
hook
or
by
crook
she
was
entirely
in
wolf
confidence
and
he
talked
of
these
things
to
her
in
english
the
impenetrable
creature
assented
outwardly
with
no
sign
of
emotion
whatever
but
one
flash
of
the
eye
and
one
heave
of
the
bosom
swiftly
suppressed
she
waited
calmly
and
patiently
till
she
was
alone
then
yielded
to
joy
and
triumph
they
seemed
to
leap
inside
her
but
this
very
thing
alarmed
her
better
for
me
never
to
see
him
again
she
thought
his
power
over
me
is
too
terrible
ah
to
the
peace
and
comfort
i
have
been
building
up
he
will
scatter
them
to
the
winds
he
she
tried
not
to
think
of
him
too
much
and
while
she
was
so
struggling
wolf
let
out
that
alfred
was
to
have
morphia
at
dinner
the
first
day
morphia
the
accursed
drug
with
which
these
dark
men
in
these
dark
places
coax
the
reason
away
out
of
the
head
by
degrees
or
with
a
potent
dose
stupefy
the
victim
then
act
surprise
alarm
and
make
his
stupor
the
ground
for
applying
medical
treatment
to
the
doomed
wretch
edith
archbold
knew
the
game
and
at
the
word
morphia
pity
and
passion
rose
in
her
bosom
irresistible
she
smiled
in
wolf
face
and
hated
him
and
secretly
girt
herself
up
to
baffle
him
and
protect
reason
and
win
his
heart
through
his
gratitude
she
received
him
as
i
have
related
to
throw
dust
in
wolf
eyes
but
she
acted
so
admirably
that
some
went
into
alfred
ah
thought
he
she
is
angry
with
herself
for
her
amorous
folly
and
with
the
justice
of
her
sex
she
means
to
spite
poor
me
for
he
sighed
for
he
felt
her
hostility
would
be
fatal
to
him
to
give
her
no
fresh
offence
he
fell
into
her
manner
and
treated
her
with
a
world
of
distant
respect
then
again
who
else
but
she
could
have
warned
him
against
poison
then
again
if
so
why
look
so
cold
and
stern
at
him
he
cast
one
or
two
wistful
glances
at
her
but
the
artful
woman
of
thirty
was
impenetrable
in
public
to
the
candid
man
of
even
her
passion
could
not
put
them
on
an
equality
that
night
he
could
not
sleep
he
lay
wondering
what
would
be
the
next
foul
practice
and
how
he
should
parry
it
he
wrote
next
morning
to
the
commissioners
that
two
of
their
number
unacquainted
with
the
previous
proceedings
of
the
board
had
been
surprised
into
endorsing
an
order
of
transfer
to
an
asylum
bearing
a
very
inferior
character
to
wycherley
the
object
of
this
was
clearly
foul
play
accordingly
wolf
had
already
tried
to
poison
his
reason
by
drugging
his
beer
at
dinner
he
added
that
wycherley
had
now
signed
a
certificate
of
his
sanity
and
implored
the
board
to
inspect
it
and
discharge
him
at
once
or
else
let
a
solicitor
visit
him
at
once
and
take
the
requisite
steps
towards
a
public
inquiry
while
waiting
anxiously
for
the
answer
it
cost
him
all
his
philosophy
to
keep
his
heart
from
eating
itself
but
he
fought
the
good
fight
of
reason
he
invited
the
confidences
of
the
quieter
mad
people
and
established
a
little
court
and
heard
their
grievances
and
by
impartial
decisions
and
good
humour
won
the
regard
of
the
moderate
patients
and
of
the
attendants
all
but
three
rooke
the
head
keeper
a
morose
burly
ruffian
hayes
a
bilious
subordinate
rooke
shadow
and
vulcan
a
huge
mastiff
that
would
let
nobody
but
rooke
touch
him
he
was
as
big
as
a
large
calf
and
formidable
as
a
small
lion
though
nearly
toothless
with
age
he
was
let
loose
in
the
yard
at
night
and
was
an
element
in
the
restraint
system
many
a
patient
would
have
tried
to
escape
but
for
vulcan
he
was
also
an
invaluable
howler
at
night
and
so
cooperated
with
wolf
bugs
and
fleas
to
avert
sleep
that
vile
foe
to
insanity
and
all
our
diseases
private
asylums
included
alfred
treated
archbold
with
a
distant
respect
that
tried
her
hard
but
that
able
woman
wore
sweetness
and
unobtrusive
kindness
and
bided
her
time
in
drayton
house
the
keeperesses
eclipsed
the
keepers
in
cruelty
to
the
poorer
patients
no
men
except
wolf
and
his
assistant
had
a
into
their
department
so
there
was
nobody
they
could
deceive
nobody
they
held
worth
the
trouble
in
the
absence
of
male
critics
they
showed
their
real
selves
and
how
wise
it
is
to
trust
that
gentle
sex
in
the
dark
with
irresponsible
power
over
females
with
unflagging
patience
they
applied
the
hourly
torture
of
petty
insolence
needless
humiliation
unreasonable
refusals
to
the
poor
madwomen
bored
them
with
the
poisoned
gimlet
and
made
their
hearts
bleeding
but
minute
cruelty
and
wild
caprice
were
not
enough
for
them
though
these
never
tired
nor
rested
they
must
vilify
them
too
with
degrading
and
savage
names
billingsgate
might
have
gone
to
school
to
drayton
house
alia
they
seemed
in
love
with
a
term
that
othello
hit
upon
only
they
used
it
not
once
but
fifty
times
a
day
and
struck
decent
women
with
it
on
the
face
like
a
scorpion
whip
and
then
the
scalding
tears
were
sure
to
run
in
torrents
down
their
silly
honest
burning
cheeks
but
this
was
not
all
they
had
got
a
large
tank
in
a
flagged
room
nominally
for
cleanliness
and
cure
but
really
for
bane
and
torture
for
the
least
offence
or
out
of
mere
wantonness
they
would
drag
a
patient
stark
naked
across
the
yard
and
thrust
her
bodily
under
water
again
and
again
keeping
her
down
till
almost
gone
with
suffocation
and
dismissing
her
more
dead
than
alive
with
obscene
and
insulting
comments
ringing
in
her
ears
to
get
warm
again
in
the
cold
this
my
ladies
called
in
the
ordinary
morning
ablutions
they
tanked
without
suffocating
but
the
immersion
of
the
whole
body
in
cold
water
was
of
itself
a
severe
trial
to
those
numerous
patients
in
whom
the
circulation
was
weak
and
as
medical
treatment
hurtful
and
even
dangerous
finally
these
keeperesses
with
diabolical
insolence
and
cruelty
would
bathe
twenty
patients
in
this
tank
and
then
make
them
drink
that
foul
water
for
their
meals
the
dark
places
of
the
land
are
full
of
horrible
one
day
they
tanked
so
savagely
that
nurse
eliza
after
months
of
sickly
disapproval
came
to
the
new
redresser
of
grievances
and
told
what
was
he
to
do
he
seized
the
only
chance
of
redress
he
ran
panting
with
indignation
to
archbold
and
blushing
high
said
imploringly
mrs
archbold
you
used
to
be
kindhearted
and
could
say
no
more
for
something
rising
in
his
throat
archbold
smiled
encouragingly
on
him
and
said
softly
i
am
the
same
i
always
was
to
you
oh
thank
you
then
pray
send
for
nurse
eliza
and
hear
the
cruelties
that
are
being
done
to
the
patients
within
a
yard
of
you
had
better
tell
me
yourself
if
you
want
me
to
pay
any
i
ca
i
do
know
how
to
speak
to
a
lady
of
such
things
as
are
done
here
the
brutes
the
cowardly
oh
how
i
should
like
to
kill
archbold
laughed
a
little
at
his
enthusiasm
fancy
caring
so
what
was
done
to
a
pack
of
women
and
sent
for
nurse
eliza
she
came
and
being
questioned
told
archbold
more
than
she
had
alfred
and
said
she
whimpering
they
have
just
been
tanking
one
they
had
no
business
to
touch
it
is
dale
her
that
is
so
close
on
her
confinement
they
tanked
her
cruel
they
did
and
kept
her
under
water
till
she
was
nigh
gone
i
came
away
i
could
stand
alfred
was
walking
about
in
a
fury
and
nurse
eliza
in
making
this
last
revolting
communication
lowered
her
voice
for
him
not
to
hear
but
his
senses
were
quick
i
think
he
heard
for
he
turned
and
came
quickly
to
them
mrs
archbold
you
are
strong
and
brave
for
a
woman
oh
do
go
in
to
them
and
take
them
by
the
throat
and
shake
the
life
out
of
them
the
merciless
cowardly
beasts
oh
that
i
could
be
a
woman
for
an
hour
or
they
could
be
men
i
soon
have
my
foot
on
some
of
the
archbold
acted
ignition
come
with
me
both
of
you
she
said
and
they
were
soon
in
the
female
department
up
came
keeperesses
directly
smirking
and
curtseying
to
her
and
pretending
not
to
look
at
adonis
which
of
you
nurses
tanked
dale
said
she
sternly
was
i
was
oh
fie
said
eliza
to
one
you
know
you
were
at
the
head
of
she
pointed
out
two
as
the
leaders
the
archbold
instantly
had
them
seized
by
the
others
who
with
treachery
equal
to
their
cowardice
turned
eagerly
against
their
to
make
friends
with
power
and
inviting
all
the
sensible
maniacs
who
had
been
tanked
to
assist
or
inspect
she
bared
her
own
statuesque
arms
and
ably
aided
soon
plunged
the
offenders
screaming
crying
and
whining
like
spaniel
bitches
whipped
under
the
dirty
water
they
swallowed
some
and
appreciated
their
own
acts
then
she
forced
them
to
walk
twice
round
the
yard
with
their
wet
clothes
clinging
to
them
hooted
by
the
late
victims
there
said
alfred
let
that
teach
you
men
will
not
own
hyaenas
in
petticoats
for
poor
alfred
took
all
the
credit
of
this
performance
but
in
fact
when
the
archbold
invited
him
to
bear
a
hand
he
showed
the
white
feather
wo
touch
the
blackguardesses
said
he
haughtily
turning
it
off
on
the
score
of
contempt
give
it
them
again
again
brava
mosaic
retribution
completed
archbold
told
the
nurses
if
ever
tanking
recurred
she
would
bundle
the
whole
female
staff
into
the
street
and
then
have
them
indicted
by
the
these
virtuous
acts
did
edith
archbold
for
love
for
a
young
man
whether
mad
women
or
sane
women
pregnant
or
the
reverse
were
tanked
or
not
she
cared
at
heart
no
more
than
whether
sheep
were
washed
or
no
in
ettrick
distant
dale
she
was
retiring
with
a
tender
look
at
alfred
and
her
pulse
secretly
unaccelerated
by
of
when
her
grateful
favourite
appealed
to
her
again
dear
archbold
shall
we
punish
and
not
comfort
this
poor
dale
the
archbold
could
have
boxed
his
ears
dear
boy
she
murmured
tenderly
you
teach
us
all
our
she
visited
the
tanked
one
found
her
in
a
cold
room
after
it
shivering
like
ague
and
her
teeth
chattering
archbold
had
her
to
the
fire
and
got
her
warm
clothes
and
a
pint
of
wine
and
probably
saved
her
life
and
her
child
for
love
of
a
young
man
why
i
think
dale
would
otherwise
have
left
this
shifting
scene
carey
the
last
woman
in
her
condition
they
tanked
and
then
turned
into
a
flagged
cell
that
only
wanted
one
frog
of
a
grotto
was
found
soon
after
moribund
on
which
they
bundled
her
out
of
the
asylum
to
die
she
did
die
next
day
at
home
but
murdered
by
the
asylum
and
they
told
the
commissioners
she
died
through
her
friends
taking
her
away
from
the
asylum
too
soon
the
commissioners
had
nothing
to
do
but
believe
this
and
did
believe
it
inspectors
who
visit
a
temple
of
darkness
lies
cunning
and
hypocrisy
four
times
a
year
know
mighty
little
of
what
goes
on
there
the
odd
three
hundred
and
days
five
hours
minutes
and
seconds
arithmetic
of
my
boyhood
i
hear
the
world
revolves
some
minutes
quicker
now
now
alfred
said
archbold
i
ca
be
everywhere
or
know
everything
so
you
come
to
me
when
anything
grieves
you
and
let
me
be
the
agent
of
your
she
said
this
so
charmingly
he
was
surprised
into
kissing
her
fair
hand
then
blushed
and
thanked
her
warmly
thus
she
established
a
chain
between
them
when
he
let
too
long
elapse
without
appealing
to
her
she
would
ask
his
advice
about
the
welfare
of
this
or
that
patient
and
so
she
cajoled
him
by
the
two
foibles
she
had
discerned
in
him
his
vanity
and
his
humanity
besides
alfred
there
were
two
patients
in
drayton
house
who
had
never
been
insane
a
young
man
and
an
old
woman
of
whom
anon
there
were
also
three
ladies
and
one
gentleman
who
had
been
deranged
but
had
recovered
years
ago
this
little
incident
recovery
is
followed
in
a
public
asylum
by
instant
discharge
but
in
a
private
one
money
not
sanity
is
apt
to
settle
the
question
of
egress
the
case
was
scarce
credible
in
the
nineteenth
century
years
ago
being
undeniably
cracked
he
had
done
what
wycherley
told
alfred
was
a
sure
sign
of
sanity
he
had
declared
himself
insane
and
had
even
been
so
reasonable
as
to
sign
his
own
order
and
certificates
and
so
imprison
himself
illegally
but
with
perfect
ease
no
remonstrance
against
that
illegality
from
the
guardians
of
the
law
when
he
got
what
plain
men
call
sane
he
naturally
wanted
to
be
free
and
happening
to
remember
he
alone
had
signed
the
order
of
imprisonment
and
the
imaginary
doctor
certificates
he
claimed
his
discharge
from
illegal
confinement
answer
first
obtain
a
legal
order
for
your
on
this
he
signed
an
order
for
his
discharge
that
is
not
a
legal
it
is
as
legal
as
the
order
on
which
i
am
granted
but
legally
or
not
the
asylum
has
got
you
the
open
air
has
not
got
you
possession
is
points
of
lunacy
law
die
your
own
illegal
prisoner
and
let
your
kinsfolk
eat
your
land
and
drink
your
consols
and
bury
you
in
a
pauper
shroud
all
that
alfred
could
do
for
these
victims
was
to
promise
to
try
and
get
them
out
some
day
but
there
was
a
youth
francis
beverley
who
had
the
honour
to
be
under
the
protection
of
the
lord
chancellor
now
a
lunatic
or
a
softy
protected
by
that
functionary
is
literally
a
lamb
protected
by
a
wolf
and
that
wolf
the
cruellest
cunningest
old
mangler
and
fleecer
of
innocents
in
christendom
chancery
lunatics
are
the
richest
class
yet
numbers
of
them
are
flung
among
pauper
and
even
criminal
lunatics
at
a
few
pounds
a
year
while
their
committees
bag
of
the
money
that
has
been
assigned
to
keep
the
patient
in
comfort
unfortunately
the
protection
of
the
chancellor
extends
to
life
and
reason
as
well
as
fleece
with
the
following
result
in
public
asylums
about
forty
per
cent
are
said
to
be
cured
in
private
ones
per
cent
at
least
most
of
them
poorish
of
chancery
lunatics
not
five
per
cent
finally
of
all
the
chancery
lunatics
do
every
six
years
exchange
the
living
tombs
they
are
fleeced
and
bullied
in
for
dead
tombs
where
they
rest
and
go
from
the
sham
protection
of
the
lord
chancellor
of
england
to
the
real
protection
of
their
creator
and
their
judge
these
statistics
have
been
long
before
the
world
and
are
dead
figures
to
the
skimmer
of
things
but
tell
a
dark
tale
to
the
reader
of
things
so
dark
that
i
pray
heaven
to
protect
me
and
all
other
weak
inoffensive
persons
from
the
protection
of
my
lord
chancellor
in
this
kind
beverley
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
exist
before
the
date
of
the
above
petition
and
suffered
the
consequences
he
was
an
aristocrat
by
birth
noble
on
both
sides
of
his
house
and
unluckily
had
money
but
for
that
he
would
have
been
a
labouring
man
and
free
my
lord
protector
committed
him
with
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
maintenance
money
to
the
care
of
his
committee
the
honourable
fynes
beverley
now
this
corporate
yet
honourable
individual
to
whom
something
was
committed
and
so
chancery
lane
called
him
in
its
own
sweet
french
the
thing
committed
was
a
gentleman
of
birth
breeding
and
intelligence
he
undertook
to
take
care
of
his
simple
cousin

what
he
did
take

of

victim
of
our
great
national
vice
and
foible
vicariousness
this
scion
of
a
noble
house
protected
in
theory
by
the
crown
vicariously
by
the
chancellor
protected
by
his
kin
was
really
flung
unprotected
into
the
fleece
market
and
might
be
seen
at
the
end
of
the
long
chain
of
subs
pros
vices
locos
shams
shuffles
swindles
and
lies
shaking
the
carpets
making
the
beds
carrying
the
water
sweeping
the
rooms
and
scouring
the
sordid
vessels
of
thirty
patients
in
drayton
house
not
one
of
whom
was
his
equal
either
in
birth
or
wealth
and
of
four
menials
who
were
all
his
masters
and
hard
ones
his
work
was
always
doing
never
done
he
was
not
the
least
mad
nor
bad
but
merely
of
feeble
intellect
all
round
fifty
thousand
gentlemen
families
would
have
been
glad
of
him
at
a
year
and
made
a
son
and
a
brother
of
him
but
he
was
under
the
vicarious
protection
of
the
lord
chancellor
thin
threadbare
out
at
elbows
the
universal
butt
scoffed
at
by
the
very
lunatics
and
especially
ill
treated
by
the
attendants
whose
work
he
did
gratis
he
was
sworn
at
jeered
insulted
cuffed
and
even
kicked
every
day
of
his
hard
hard
life
and
yet
he
was
a
gentleman
though
a
soft
one
his
hands
his
features
his
carriage
his
address
had
all
an
indefinable
stamp
of
race
how
had
it
outlived
such
crushing
degrading
usage
i
do
know
how
does
a
daisy
survive
the
iron
roller
alfred
soon
found
him
out
and
to
everybody
amazement
especially
frank
remonstrated
gently
but
resolutely
and
eloquently
and
soon
convinced
the
majority
sane
and
insane
that
a
creature
so
meek
and
useful
merited
special
kindness
not
cruelty
one
keeper
the
robin
tom
wales
an
ex
prize
fighter
was
a
warm
convert
to
this
view
among
the
maniacs
only
one
held
out
and
said
contemptuously
he
could
see
it
well
said
alfred
lay
a
finger
on
him
after
this
and
i
lay
a
hand
on
you
and
aid
your
intellectual
rooke
and
hayes
treated
remonstrance
with
open
and
galling
contempt
yet
the
tide
of
opinion
changed
so
they
did
not
care
to
defy
it
openly
but
they
bullied
poor
beverley
now
and
then
on
the
sly
and
he
never
told
he
was
too
inoffensive
for
this
world
but
one
day
as
alfred
was
sitting
with
his
door
ajar
writing
a
letter
of
earnest
expostulation
to
the
commissioners
who
had
left
his
first
unanswered
he
heard
hayes
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
call
roughly
frank
frank
sir
replied
the
soft
little
voice
of
young
beverley
come
be
quick
young
i
coming
sir
and
up
ran
beverley
here
take
this
tray
yes
stop
there
a
bit
of
bread
for
and
hayes
chucked
him
a
crust
as
one
throws
it
to
another
man
dog
thank
you
sir
said
beverley
stooping
down
for
it
and
being
habitually
as
hungry
as
a
ratcatcher
tyke
took
an
eager
bite
in
that
position
how
dare
you
eat
it
there
said
hayes
brutally
take
it
to
your
own
crib
come
and
with
that
lent
him
a
contemptuous
kick
behind
which
owing
to
his
position
sent
him
off
his
balance
flat
on
the
tray
a
glass
broke
under
him
poor
young
beverley
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
for
he
knew
hayes
would
not
own
himself
the
cause
hayes
cursed
him
for
an
awkward
idiot
and
the
oath
went
off
into
a
howl
for
alfred
ran
out
at
him
brimful
of
moses
and
with
a
savage
kick
in
the
back
and
blow
on
the
neck
administered
simultaneously
hurled
him
head
foremost
down
the
stairs
alighting
on
the
seventh
step
he
turned
a
somersault
and
bounded
like
a
ball
on
to
the
landing
below
and
there
lay
stupefied
he
picked
himself
up
by
slow
degrees
and
glared
round
with
speechless
awe
and
amazement
up
at
the
human
thunderbolt
that
had
shot
out
on
him
and
sent
him
flying
like
a
feather
he
shook
his
fist
and
limped
silently
away
all
bruises
and
curses
to
tell
rooke
and
concert
vengeance
alfred
trembling
still
with
ire
took
beverley
to
his
room
the
boy
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
encouraged
him
and
made
him
wash
properly
brushed
his
hair
dressed
him
in
a
decent
tweed
suit
he
had
outgrown
and
taking
him
under
his
arm
and
walking
with
his
own
nose
haughtily
in
the
air
paraded
him
up
and
down
the
asylum
to
show
them
all
the
best
man
in
the
house
respected
the
poor
soft
gentleman
ah
what
a
grand
thing
it
is
to
be
young
beverley
clung
to
his
protector
too
much
like
a
girl
but
walked
gracefully
and
kept
step
and
every
now
and
then
looked
up
at
alfred
with
a
loving
adoration
that
was
sweet
yet
sad
to
see
alfred
marched
him
to
archbold
and
told
his
tale
for
he
knew
hayes
would
misrepresent
it
and
get
him
into
trouble
she
smiled
on
the
pair
gently
deplored
her
favourite
impetuosity
entreated
him
not
to
go
fighting
with
that
great
monster
rooke
and
charmed
him
by
saying
well
and
frank
a
gentleman
when
he
is
dressed
like
is
he
said
alfred
eagerly
and
whose
fault
is
it
he
is
not
always
dressed
like
one
whose
fault
that
here
an
earl
nephew
in
hell
not
yours
alfred
nor
mine
was
the
honeyed
reply
in
vain
did
hayes
prefer
his
complaint
to
wolf
the
archbold
had
been
before
him
and
the
answer
was
served
you
these
and
many
other
good
deeds
did
alfred
hardie
in
drayton
house
but
as
the
days
rolled
on
and
no
answer
came
from
the
commissioners
his
own
anxiety
grief
and
dismay
left
him
less
and
less
able
to
sympathise
with
the
material
but
smaller
wrongs
around
him
he
became
silent
dejected
at
last
he
came
to
archbold
and
said
sternly
his
letters
to
the
commissioners
were
intercepted
i
ca
believe
that
said
she
it
is
against
the
so
it
was
but
law
and
custom
are
two
i
am
sure
of
it
said
he
and
may
the
eternal
curse
of
heaven
light
on
the
cowardly
traitor
and
miscreant
who
has
done
and
he
stalked
gloomily
away
when
he
left
her
she
sighed
at
this
imprecation
from
his
lips
but
did
not
repent
i
part
with
him
she
said
despairingly
and
if
i
did
not
stop
his
poor
dear
letters
wolf
would
and
the
amorous
crocodile
shed
a
tear
and
persisted
in
her
course
when
she
saw
him
getting
thinner
and
paler
and
his
bright
face
downcast
and
inexpressibly
sad
she
shared
his
misery
ay
shed
scalding
tears
for
him
yet
could
not
give
him
up
for
her
will
was
as
strong
as
the
rest
of
her
was
supple
and
hers
was
hot
love
but
not
true
love
like
julia
perhaps
a
very
subtle
observer
seeing
this
man
and
woman
wax
pale
and
spiritless
together
in
one
house
might
have
divined
her
secret
wolf
then
was
no
such
observer
for
she
made
him
believe
she
had
a
rising
for
him
he
really
had
a
strong
one
for
her
while
alfred
visible
misery
pulled
at
her
and
sometimes
irritated
sometimes
melted
her
came
curious
complications
one
of
which
requires
preface
dodd
then
was
not
the
wife
to
trust
blindly
where
her
poor
husband
was
concerned
she
bribed
so
well
that
a
keeperess
in
david
first
asylum
told
her
david
had
been
harshly
used
by
an
attendant
she
instantly
got
eve
dodd
to
take
him
away
and
transfer
him
to
a
small
asylum
nearer
london
and
kept
by
a
ellis
women
are
not
cruel
to
men
said
the
sagacious
lucy
dodd
but
alas
if
women
are
not
cruel
where
sex
comes
in
and
mimics
that
wider
sentiment
humanity
women
are
deadly
economical
largely
gifted
with
that
household
virtue
ellis
kept
too
few
servants
and
sure
consequence
in
a
madhouse
too
many
straitjackets
hobbles
muffs
bodybelts
hence
half
her
patients
were
frequently
kept
out
of
harm
way
by
cruel
restraints
administered
not
out
of
hearty
cruelty
but
female
parsimony
and
miss
dodd
invaded
the
house
one
day
when
the
fair
economist
was
out
and
found
seven
patients
out
of
the
twelve
kept
out
of
mischief
thus
one
in
a
restraint
chair
two
hobbled
like
asses
two
chained
like
dogs
and
two
in
and
fastened
to
beds
by
webbing
and
straps
amongst
the
latter
david
though
quiet
as
a
lamb
dodd
cried
over
him
as
if
her
heart
would
break
and
made
miss
dodd
shift
him
to
a
large
asylum
where
i
believe
he
was
very
well
used
but
here
those
dreadful
newspapers
interfered
a
prying
into
sweet
secluded
spots
they
diversified
dodd
breakfast
by
informing
her
that
the
doctor
of
this
asylum
had
just
killed
a
patient
the
mode
of
execution
bloodless
and
sure
as
became
fair
science
it
was
a
man
between
sixty
and
seventy
an
age
at
which
the
heart
can
seldom
stand
very
much
shocking
or
lowering
especially
where
the
brain
is
diseased
so
they
placed
him
in
a
narrow
enough
to
impede
respiration
without
the
falling
water
which
of
necessity
drives
out
air
in
short
a
vertical
box
with
holes
all
round
the
top
here
the
doctor
ordered
him
a
cold
of
unparalleled
duration
half
an
hour
to
be
followed
by
an
unprecedented
dose
of
tartar
emetic
this
order
given
the
doctor
went
away
formula
the
water
was
down
to
degrees
fahrenheit
half
an
at
that
temperature
in
a
roomy
bath
would
kill
the
youngest
and
strongest
man
in
her
majesty
dominions
for
mortal
minutes
the
poor
old
man
stood
in
this
vertical
coffin
under
this
cold
cascade
six
hundred
gallons
of
icy
water
were
in
that
his
last
hour
his
last
discharged
upon
his
devoted
head
and
doomed
body
he
had
to
be
helped
away
from
this
he
had
walked
into
in
high
spirits
poor
soul
even
this
change
awakened
no
misgivings
no
remorse
though
you
or
i
or
any
man
or
woman
picked
at
hazard
out
of
the
streets
would
at
once
have
seen
that
he
was
dying
he
was
duly
dozed
by
the
fire
with
four
spoonfuls
of
antimonial
tincture
mak
but
even
the
destructive
art
of
healing
can
not
slay
the
slain
the
old
man
cheated
the
emetic
for
before
it
could
hurt
him
he
died
of
the
bath
and
his
body
told
its
own
sad
tale
to
use
the
words
of
a
medical
it
was
a
piece
of
the
had
driven
the
whole
circulation
from
the
surface
this
mode
of
execution
is
well
known
in
the
united
states
they
settle
refractory
prisoners
with
it
periodically
but
half
an
hour
is
not
needed
twenty
minutes
will
do
the
trick
harper
weekly
a
year
or
two
ago
contained
an
admirable
woodcut
of
a
negro
execution
by
water
in
this
remarkable
picture
you
see
the
poor
darkie
seated
powerless
howling
and
panting
his
life
away
under
the
deadly
cascade
and
there
stands
the
stolid
turnkey
erect
formal
stiff
as
a
ramrod
pulling
the
deadly
string
with
a
sort
of
drill
exercise
air
and
no
more
compunction
nor
reflection
than
if
he
himself
was
a
machine
constructed
to
pull
strings
or
triggers
on
his
own
string
being
pulled
by
butcher
or
fool
a
picture
well
studied
and
so
worth
study
dodd
was
terrified
and
in
spite
of
sampson
assurance
that
this
was
the
asylum
of
all
others
they
would
not
settle
another
patient
in
until
the
matter
should
have
blown
over
got
eve
dodd
to
write
to
wolf
and
offer
a
year
if
he
would
take
david
at
once
and
treat
him
with
especial
consideration
he
showed
this
letter
triumphantly
to
archbold
and
she
blinded
for
a
moment
by
feeling
dissuaded
him
from
receiving
captain
dodd
he
stared
at
her
what
turn
away
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
but
they
will
come
to
visit
him
and
perhaps
see
oh
that
can
be
managed
you
must
be
on
your
guard
and
i
warn
rooke
i
ca
turn
away
money
on
a
one
day
alfred
found
himself
locked
into
his
room
this
was
unusual
for
though
they
called
him
a
lunatic
in
words
they
called
him
sane
by
all
their
acts
he
half
suspected
that
the
commissioners
were
in
the
house
had
he
known
who
really
was
in
the
house
he
would
have
beaten
himself
to
pieces
against
the
door
at
dinner
there
was
a
new
patient
very
mild
and
silent
with
a
beautiful
large
brown
eye
like
some
gentle
animal
alfred
was
very
much
struck
with
this
eye
and
contrived
to
say
a
kind
word
to
him
after
dinner
finding
himself
addressed
by
a
gentleman
the
new
comer
handled
his
forelock
and
made
a
sea
scrape
and
announced
himself
as
william
thompson
he
added
with
simple
pride
able
seaman
then
touching
his
forelock
again
just
come
aboard
your
after
this
which
came
off
glibly
he
was
anything
but
communicative
however
alfred
contrived
to
extract
from
him
that
he
was
rather
glad
to
leave
his
last
ship
on
account
of
having
been
constantly
impeded
there
in
his
duties
by
a
set
of
lubbers
that
clung
round
him
and
kept
him
on
deck
whenever
the
first
lieutenant
ordered
him
into
the
top
the
very
next
day
pacing
sadly
the
dull
gravel
of
his
prison
yard
alfred
heard
a
row
and
there
was
the
able
seaman
struggling
with
the
robin
and
two
other
keepers
he
wanted
to
go
to
his
duties
in
the
foretop
to
wit
the
fork
of
a
high
in
the
alfred
had
half
a
mind
not
to
interfere
who
cares
for
misery
he
said
but
his
better
nature
prevailed
and
he
told
the
robin
he
was
sure
going
up
imaginary
rigging
would
do
thompson
more
good
than
harm
on
this
the
men
reluctantly
gave
him
a
trial
and
he
went
up
the
tree
with
wonderful
strength
and
agility
but
evident
caution
still
alfred
quaked
when
he
crossed
his
thighs
tight
over
a
limb
of
the
tree
forty
feet
from
earth
and
went
carefully
and
minutely
through
the
whole
process
of
furling
imaginary
sails
however
he
came
down
manifestly
soothed
by
the
performance
and
singular
phenomenon
he
was
quite
cool
and
it
was
the
spectators
on
deck
who
perspired
and
what
a
pleasant
voice
he
has
said
alfred
it
quite
charms
my
ear
it
is
not
like
a
mad
voice
it
is
like
i
mad
and
he
has
got
a
fiddle
and
plays
it
like
a
hangel
by
all
accounts
said
the
robin
only
he
wo
touch
it
but
when
he
has
a
at
night
alfred
dreamed
he
heard
julia
sweet
mellow
voice
speaking
to
him
and
he
looked
and
lo
it
was
the
able
seaman
he
could
sleep
no
more
but
lay
sighing
ere
the
able
seaman
had
been
there
three
days
dodd
came
unexpectedly
to
see
him
and
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
alfred
was
smuggled
out
of
the
way
archbold
saw
by
her
loving
anxiety
these
visits
would
be
frequent
and
unless
alfred
was
kept
constantly
locked
up
which
was
repugnant
to
her
they
would
meet
some
day
she
knew
there
are
men
who
ply
the
trade
of
spies
and
where
to
find
them
she
set
one
of
them
to
watch
dodd
house
and
learn
her
habits
in
hopes
of
getting
some
clue
as
to
when
she
might
be
expected
now
it
so
happened
that
looking
for
one
thing
she
found
another
which
gave
her
great
hopes
and
courage
and
then
the
sight
of
alfred
misery
tried
her
patience
and
then
he
was
beginning
half
to
suspect
her
of
stopping
his
letters
passion
impatience
pity
and
calculation
all
drove
her
the
same
road
and
led
to
an
extraordinary
scene
so
impregnated
with
the
genius
of
the
madhouse
a
place
where
the
passions
run
out
to
the
very
end
of
their
tether
that
i
feel
little
able
to
describe
it
i
will
try
and
indicate
it
one
fine
sunday
afternoon
then
she
asked
alfred
languidly
would
he
like
to
walk
in
the
country
would
i
like
ah
do
trifle
with
a
prisoner
said
he
sorrowfully
she
shook
her
head
no
no
it
will
not
be
a
happy
walk
rooke
who
hates
you
is
to
follow
us
with
that
terrible
mastiff
to
pull
you
down
if
you
try
to
escape
i
could
not
get
wolf
to
consent
on
any
other
terms
alfred
let
us
give
up
the
idea
i
fear
your
no
no
i
wo
try
to
escape
from
you
i
have
not
seen
a
blade
of
grass
this
six
the
accomplished
dissembler
hesitated
yielded
they
passed
through
the
yard
and
out
at
the
back
door
which
alfred
had
so
often
looked
wistfully
at
and
reached
a
delicious
pasture
a
light
golden
haze
streamed
across
it
nature
never
seemed
so
sweet
so
divine
to
alfred
before
the
sun
as
bright
as
midsummer
though
not
the
least
hot
the
air
fresh
yet
genial
and
perfumed
with
liberty
and
the
smaller
flowers
of
earth
beauty
glided
rustling
by
his
side
and
dark
eyes
subdued
their
native
fire
into
softness
whenever
they
turned
on
him
and
scarce
fifty
yards
in
the
rear
hung
a
bully
and
a
mastiff
ready
to
tear
him
down
if
he
should
break
away
from
beauty
light
hand
that
rested
so
timidly
on
his
he
was
young
and
and
relished
his
peep
of
liberty
and
nature
though
blotted
by
vulcan
and
rooke
he
chatted
to
archbold
in
good
spirits
she
answered
briefly
and
listlessly
at
last
she
stopped
under
a
young
as
if
overcome
with
a
sudden
reflection
and
turning
half
away
from
him
leaned
her
head
and
hand
upon
a
bough
and
sighed
the
attitude
was
pensive
and
womanly
he
asked
her
with
innocent
concern
what
was
the
matter
then
faintly
should
he
take
her
home
all
her
answer
was
to
press
his
hand
with
hers
that
was
disengaged
and
instead
of
sighing
to
cry
the
novice
in
woman
wiles
set
himself
to
comfort
her
in
vain
to
question
her
in
vain
at
first
but
by
degrees
she
allowed
him
to
learn
that
it
was
for
him
she
mourned
and
so
they
proceeded
on
the
old
old
plan
the
man
extorting
from
the
woman
bit
by
bit
just
so
much
as
she
wanted
all
along
to
say
and
would
have
poured
in
a
stream
if
let
quite
alone
he
drew
from
his
distressed
friend
that
wolf
for
reasons
of
his
own
had
made
special
inquiries
about
the
dodds
that
she
had
fortunately
or
unfortunately
heard
of
this
and
had
questioned
the
person
employed
hoping
to
hear
something
that
might
comfort
alfred
instead
of
that
said
she
i
find
miss
dodd
is
like
most
girls
out
of
sight
is
out
of
mind
with
what
do
you
mean
said
alfred
trembling
suddenly
do
not
ask
me
what
a
weak
fool
i
was
to
let
you
see
i
was
unhappy
for
the
truth
is
the
truth
gasped
alfred
tell
me
at
must
i
i
am
afraid
you
will
hate
me
for
i
should
hate
any
one
who
told
me
your
faults
well
then
if
i
must
miss
dodd
has
a
it
is
a
lie
cried
alfred
furiously
i
wish
it
was
but
she
has
two
in
fact
both
of
them
clergymen
however
one
seems
the
favourite
at
least
they
are
engaged
to
be
married
it
is
hurd
the
curate
of
the
parish
she
lives
in
by
what
i
hear
she
is
one
of
the
religious
ones
so
perhaps
that
has
brought
the
pair
to
an
at
these
words
a
cold
sickness
rushed
all
over
alfred
beginning
at
his
heart
he
stood
white
and
stupefied
a
moment
then
in
the
anguish
of
his
heart
broke
out
into
a
great
and
terrible
cry
it
was
like
a
young
lion
wounded
with
a
poisoned
shaft
then
he
was
silent
and
stood
stock
still
like
petrified
despair
archbold
was
prepared
for
an
outburst
but
not
of
this
kind
his
anguish
was
so
unlike
a
woman
that
it
staggered
her
her
good
and
bad
angels
to
use
an
expressive
though
somewhat
too
poetical
phrase
battled
for
her
she
had
an
impulse
to
earn
his
gratitude
for
life
to
let
him
out
of
the
asylum
ere
julia
should
be
hurd
and
even
liberty
come
too
late
for
true
love
she
looked
again
at
the
statue
of
grief
by
her
side
and
burst
out
crying
in
earnest
this
was
unfortunate
shallow
pity
exuding
in
salt
water
leaves
not
enough
behind
to
gush
forth
in
good
deeds
she
only
tried
to
undo
her
own
work
in
part
to
comfort
him
a
little
with
commonplaces
she
told
him
in
a
soothing
whisper
there
were
other
women
in
the
world
besides
this
inconstant
girl
others
who
could
love
him
as
he
deserved
he
made
no
answer
to
all
she
could
say
but
just
waved
his
hand
once
impatiently
petty
consolation
seemed
to
sting
him
she
drew
back
discouraged
but
only
for
a
while
he
was
silent
with
one
grand
serpentine
movement
she
came
suddenly
close
to
him
and
standing
half
behind
him
laid
her
hand
softly
on
his
shoulder
and
poured
burning
love
in
his
ear
alfred
she
murmured
we
are
both
unhappy
let
us
comfort
one
another
i
had
pity
on
you
at
silverton
house
i
pity
you
now
pity
a
little
in
turn
take
me
out
of
this
dreadful
house
out
of
this
revolting
life
and
let
me
be
with
you
let
me
be
your
housekeeper
your
servant
your
slave
this
news
that
has
shocked
you
so
has
torn
the
veil
from
my
eyes
i
thought
i
had
cooled
my
love
down
to
friendship
and
tender
esteem
but
no
now
i
see
you
as
unhappy
as
myself
now
i
can
speak
and
wrong
no
one
i
own
i
oh
alfred
my
heart
burns
for
you
bleeds
for
you
yearns
for
you
sickens
for
you
dies
for
oh
hush
hush
archbold
you
are
saying
things
you
will
blush
for
the
next
i
blush
now
but
can
not
hush
i
have
gone
too
far
and
your
happiness
as
well
as
mine
is
at
stake
no
young
girl
can
understand
or
value
such
a
man
as
you
are
but
i
like
you
have
suffered
i
like
you
am
constant
i
like
you
am
warm
and
tender
at
my
age
a
woman
love
is
bliss
to
him
who
can
gain
it
and
i
love
you
with
all
my
soul
alfred
i
worship
the
ground
you
walk
on
my
sweet
sweet
boy
say
you
the
word
dearest
and
i
will
bribe
the
servants
and
get
the
keys
and
sacrifice
my
profession
for
ever
to
give
you
liberty
see
how
sweet
the
open
face
of
nature
is
sweeter
than
anything
on
earth
but
love
and
all
i
ask
is
a
little
little
of
your
heart
in
return
give
me
a
chance
to
make
you
mine
for
ever
and
if
i
fail
treat
me
as
i
shall
deserve
desert
me
at
once
and
then
i
never
reproach
you
i
only
die
for
you
as
i
have
lived
for
you
ever
since
i
first
saw
your
heavenly
the
passionate
woman
paused
at
last
but
her
hot
cheek
and
heaving
bosom
and
tender
convulsive
hand
prolonged
the
pleading
i
am
afraid
few
men
of
her
own
age
would
have
resisted
her
for
voice
and
speech
and
all
burning
melting
and
winning
and
then
so
reasonable
lads
she
did
not
stipulate
for
constancy
but
alfred
turned
round
to
her
blushing
and
sorrowful
for
shame
he
said
this
is
not
love
you
abuse
that
sacred
word
indeed
if
you
had
ever
really
loved
you
would
have
pitied
me
and
julia
long
ago
and
respected
our
love
and
saved
us
by
giving
me
my
freedom
long
ago
i
am
not
a
fool
do
you
think
i
do
know
that
you
are
my
jailer
and
the
cunningest
and
most
dangerous
of
them
all
you
cruel
ungrateful
she
sobbed
no
i
am
not
ungrateful
either
said
he
more
gently
you
have
always
come
between
me
and
that
kind
of
torture
which
most
terrifies
vulgar
souls
and
i
thank
you
for
it
only
if
you
had
also
pitied
the
deeper
anguish
of
my
heart
i
should
thank
you
more
still
as
it
is
i
forgive
you
for
the
share
you
have
had
in
blasting
my
happiness
for
life
and
nobody
shall
ever
know
what
you
have
been
mad
enough
in
an
unguarded
moment
to
say
but
for
pity
sake
talk
no
more
of
love
to
mock
my
archbold
was
white
with
ire
long
before
he
had
done
this
sentence
you
insolent
creature
said
she
you
spurn
my
love
you
shall
feel
my
so
i
conclude
said
he
coldly
such
love
as
yours
is
hard
by
it
is
said
she
and
i
know
how
i
combine
the
two
i
loved
you
and
you
spurned
me
ere
long
you
shall
love
me
and
i
despise
you
and
not
spurn
i
do
understand
you
said
alfred
feeling
rather
uneasy
what
said
she
do
you
see
how
the
superior
mind
can
fascinate
the
inferior
look
at
frank
beverley
how
he
follows
you
about
and
fawns
on
you
like
a
little
i
prefer
his
sort
of
affection
to
a
gentleman
and
a
man
would
have
kept
that
to
himself
but
you
are
neither
one
nor
the
other
or
you
would
have
taken
my
offer
and
then
run
away
from
me
the
next
day
you
fool
a
man
betrays
a
woman
he
does
insult
her
ah
you
admire
frank
affection
well
you
shall
imitate
it
you
could
love
me
like
a
man
you
shall
love
me
like
a
how
will
you
manage
that
pray
he
inquired
with
a
sneer
i
drive
you
she
hissed
this
fiendish
threat
out
between
her
white
teeth
ay
sir
she
said
hitherto
your
reason
has
only
encountered
men
you
shall
see
now
what
an
insulted
woman
can
do
a
lunatic
you
shall
be
ere
long
and
then
i
make
you
love
me
dote
on
me
follow
me
about
for
a
smile
and
then
i
leave
off
hating
you
and
love
you
once
more
but
not
the
way
i
did
five
minutes
at
this
furious
threat
alfred
ground
his
teeth
and
said
then
i
give
you
my
honour
that
the
moment
i
see
my
reason
the
least
shaken
kill
you
and
so
save
myself
from
the
degradation
of
being
your
lover
on
any
threaten
your
own
sex
with
that
said
the
archbold
contemptuously
you
may
kill
me
whenever
you
like
and
the
sooner
the
better
only
if
you
do
do
it
very
quickly
you
shall
be
my
property
my
chapter
xli
after
a
defiance
so
bitter
and
deadly
alfred
naturally
drew
away
from
his
inamorata
but
she
boiling
with
love
and
hate
said
bitterly
we
need
not
take
rooke
into
our
secrets
come
sir
your
arm
he
stuck
it
out
ungraciously
and
averted
his
head
she
took
it
suppressed
with
difficulty
a
petty
desire
to
pinch
and
so
walked
by
his
side
he
was
as
much
at
his
ease
as
if
promenading
jungles
with
a
panther
she
felt
him
quiver
with
repugnance
under
her
soft
hand
and
prolonged
the
irritating
contact
she
walked
very
slowly
and
told
him
with
much
meaning
she
was
waiting
for
a
signal
till
then
said
she
we
will
keep
one
another
company
biting
the
word
with
her
teeth
as
it
went
out
a
window
was
opened
in
the
asylum
and
a
hung
out
archbold
pointed
it
out
to
alfred
he
stared
at
it
and
after
that
she
walked
him
rapidly
home
in
silence
but
as
soon
as
the
door
was
on
him
she
whispered
triumphantly
in
his
ear
your
was
expected
that
signal
was
to
let
me
know
she
was
my
cried
the
young
man
and
tried
in
vain
to
conceal
his
surprise
and
agitation
ay
your
that
shall
never
be
mrs
dodd
here
said
alfred
clasping
his
hands
then
he
reflected
and
said
coolly
it
is
false
what
should
she
come
here
for
to
see
your
my
what
is
he
here
too
said
alfred
with
an
incredulous
sneer
yes
the
raving
maniac
that
calls
himself
thompson
and
that
you
took
to
from
the
first
he
is
your
precious
that
shall
never
alfred
was
now
utterly
amazed
and
bewildered
archbold
eyed
him
in
silent
scorn
poor
man
said
he
at
last
and
hung
his
head
sorrowfully
no
wonder
then
his
voice
went
so
to
my
heart
how
strange
it
all
is
and
how
will
it
all
end
in
your
being
a
madman
instead
of
an
insolent
fool
hissed
the
viper
at
this
moment
beverley
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
yard
archbold
whistled
him
to
her
like
a
dog
he
came
running
zealously
who
was
that
called
while
i
was
out
she
inquired
a
polite
lady
madam
she
said
sir
to
me
and
thanked
that
sounds
like
dodd
said
the
archbold
quietly
ah
but
continued
frank
there
was
another
with
her
a
beautiful
young
lady
oh
so
beautiful
miss
julia
dodd
said
the
archbold
grimly
alfred
panted
and
his
eyes
roved
wildly
in
search
of
a
way
to
escape
and
follow
her
she
could
not
be
far
off
anybody
else
frank
inquired
archbold
no
more
ladies
madam
but
there
was
a
young
gentleman
all
in
black
i
think
he
was
a
clergyman
or
a
ah
that
was
her
husband
that
is
to
be
that
was
hurd
she
can
go
nowhere
without
him
not
even
to
see
her
old
at
these
words
every
one
of
them
an
adder
alfred
turned
on
her
furiously
and
his
long
arm
shot
out
of
its
own
accord
and
the
fingers
opened
like
an
eagle
claw
she
saw
and
understood
but
never
blenched
her
vindictive
eye
met
his
dilating
flashing
orbs
unflinchingly
you
pass
for
a
woman
he
said
and
i
am
too
wretched
for
he
turned
from
her
with
a
deep
convulsive
sob
and
almost
staggering
leaned
his
brow
against
the
wall
of
the
house
she
had
done
what
no
man
had
as
yet
succeeded
in
she
had
broken
his
spirit
and
here
a
man
would
have
left
him
alone
but
the
rejected
beauty
put
her
lips
to
his
ear
and
whispered
into
them
this
is
only
the
then
she
left
him
and
went
to
his
room
and
stole
all
his
paper
and
pens
and
ink
and
his
very
aristotle
he
was
to
have
no
occupation
now
except
to
brood
and
brood
and
brood
as
for
alfred
he
sat
down
upon
a
bench
in
the
yard
a
broken
man
up
to
this
moment
he
had
hoped
his
julia
was
as
constant
as
himself
but
no
either
she
had
heard
he
was
mad
and
with
the
universal
credulity
had
believed
it
or
perhaps
not
hearing
from
him
at
all
believed
herself
forsaken
and
was
consoling
herself
with
a
clergyman
jealousy
did
not
as
yet
infuriate
alfred
its
first
effect
resembled
that
of
a
heavy
blow
little
beverley
found
him
actually
sick
and
ran
to
the
robin
the
brought
him
a
thimbleful
of
brandy
but
he
would
not
take
it
ah
no
my
friends
he
said
that
can
not
cure
me
it
is
not
my
stomach
it
is
my
heart
broken
broken
the
robin
retired
muttering
little
beverley
kneeled
down
beside
him
and
kissed
his
hand
with
a
devotion
that
savoured
of
the
canine
yet
it
was
tender
and
the
sinking
heart
clung
to
it
oh
frank
he
cried
my
julia
believes
me
mad
or
thinks
me
false
or
something
and
she
will
marry
another
before
i
can
get
out
to
tell
her
all
i
have
endured
was
for
loving
her
what
shall
i
do
god
protect
my
reason
what
will
become
of
me
he
moaned
and
young
frank
sorrowed
over
him
till
the
harsh
voice
of
rooke
summoned
him
to
some
menial
duty
this
discharged
he
came
running
back
and
sat
on
the
bench
beside
his
crushed
benefactor
without
saying
a
word
at
last
he
delivered
this
sapient
speech
i
see
you
want
to
get
out
of
this
alfred
only
sighed
hopelessly
then
i
must
try
and
get
you
out
said
frank
alfred
shook
his
head
just
let
me
think
said
frank
solemnly
and
he
sat
silent
looking
like
a
young
owl
for
thinking
soon
puzzled
him
and
elicited
his
intellectual
weakness
whereas
in
a
groove
of
duties
he
could
go
as
smoothly
as
half
the
world
and
but
for
his
official
officious
protector
might
just
as
well
have
been
boots
at
the
swan
as
boots
and
chambermaid
at
the
wolf
so
now
force
and
cunning
had
declared
war
on
alfred
and
feebleness
in
person
enlisted
in
his
defence
his
adversary
lost
no
time
that
afternoon
rooke
told
him
he
was
henceforth
to
occupy
a
double
bedded
room
with
another
patient
if
he
should
be
violent
in
the
middle
of
the
night
sing
out
and
we
will
come
if
we
hear
you
said
the
keeper
with
a
malicious
smile
the
patient
turned
out
to
be
the
able
seaman
here
archbold
aimed
a
double
stroke
to
shake
alfred
nerves
and
show
him
how
very
mad
his
proposed
was
she
thought
that
if
he
could
once
be
forced
to
realise
this
it
might
reconcile
him
to
not
marrying
the
daughter
the
first
night
david
did
get
up
and
paraded
an
imaginary
deck
for
four
mortal
hours
alfred
sleep
was
broken
but
he
said
nothing
and
david
turned
in
again
his
watch
completed
not
a
day
passed
now
but
a
blow
was
struck
nor
was
the
victim
passive
debarred
writing
materials
he
cut
the
rims
off
several
copies
of
the
and
secreted
them
then
catching
sight
of
some
on
the
back
of
frank
scraped
them
carefully
off
melted
them
in
a
very
little
water
and
with
a
toothpick
scrawled
his
wrongs
to
the
commissioners
he
rolled
the
slips
round
a
and
wrote
outside
good
christian
keep
this
and
take
the
writing
to
the
lunacy
commissioners
at
whitehall
for
pity
this
done
he
watched
and
when
nobody
was
looking
flung
his
letter
so
weighted
over
the
gates
he
heard
it
fall
on
the
public
road
another
day
he
secreted
a
spoonful
of
black
currant
preserve
diluted
it
with
a
little
water
and
wrote
a
letter
and
threw
it
into
the
road
as
before
another
day
hearing
the
robin
express
disgust
at
the
usage
to
which
he
was
now
subjected
he
drew
him
apart
and
offered
him
a
hundred
pounds
to
get
him
out
now
the
was
rather
a
fellow
and
a
great
detester
of
foul
play
what
he
saw
made
him
now
side
heartily
with
alfred
and
all
he
wanted
was
to
be
indemnified
for
his
risk
he
looked
down
and
said
you
see
sir
i
have
a
wife
and
child
to
think
alfred
offered
him
two
hundred
pounds
that
is
more
than
enough
sir
said
the
robin
but
you
see
i
ca
do
it
alone
i
must
have
a
pal
in
it
could
you
afford
as
much
to
garrett
he
is
the
likeliest
i
heard
him
say
as
much
as
that
he
was
sick
of
the
alfred
jumped
at
the
proposal
he
would
give
them
two
hundred
apiece
i
sound
him
said
the
robin
do
you
speak
to
him
whatever
he
might
blow
the
gaff
i
must
begin
by
making
him
drunk
then
he
tell
me
his
real
one
fine
morning
the
house
was
made
much
cleaner
than
usual
the
rotatory
chair
in
which
they
used
to
spin
a
maniac
like
a
teetotum
the
restraint
chairs
and
all
the
paraphernalia
were
sent
into
the
stable
and
so
disposed
that
even
if
found
they
would
look
like
things
scorned
and
dismissed
from
service
for
wolf
mind
you
professed
the
system
alfred
asked
what
was
up
and
found
all
this
was
in
preparation
for
the
quarterly
visit
of
the
commissioners
a
visit
intended
to
be
a
surprise
but
drayton
house
always
knew
when
they
were
coming
and
the
very
names
of
the
two
thunderbolts
that
thought
to
surprise
them
archbold
communicated
her
knowledge
in
terms
it
is
only
two
old
women
bartlett
and
the
gentlemen
thus
flatteringly
heralded
arrived
next
day
one
an
aged
infirm
man
with
a
grand
benevolent
head
bald
front
and
silver
hair
and
the
cane
of
his
youth
now
a
dignified
crutch
the
other
an
ordinary
looking
little
chap
enough
with
this
merit
he
was
what
he
looked
they
had
a
long
interview
with
archbold
first
for
fear
they
should
carry
a
naked
eye
into
the
asylum
bartlett
acting
on
instructions
very
soon
inquired
about
alfred
archbold
face
put
on
friendly
concern
directly
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
is
not
so
well
as
he
was
a
fortnight
ago
not
nearly
so
well
we
have
given
him
walks
in
the
country
too
but
i
regret
to
say
they
did
him
no
real
good
he
came
back
much
excited
and
now
he
shuns
the
other
patients
which
he
used
not
to
in
short
she
gave
them
the
impression
that
alfred
was
a
moping
melancholiac
well
i
had
better
see
him
said
bartlett
just
to
satisfy
the
alfred
was
accordingly
sent
for
and
asked
with
an
indifferent
air
how
he
was
he
said
he
was
very
well
in
health
but
in
sore
distress
of
mind
at
his
letters
to
the
commissioners
being
intercepted
by
archbold
or
wolf
archbold
smiled
pityingly
bartlett
caught
her
glance
and
concluded
this
was
one
of
the
patient
delusions
formula
alfred
surprised
the
glances
and
said
you
can
hardly
believe
this
because
the
act
is
illegal
but
a
great
many
illegal
acts
that
you
never
detect
are
done
in
asylums
however
it
is
not
a
question
of
surmise
i
sent
four
letters
in
the
regular
way
since
i
came
here
are
their
several
dates
pray
make
a
note
to
inquire
whether
they
have
reached
whitehall
or
oh
certainly
to
oblige
you
said
bartlett
and
made
the
note
archbold
looked
rather
discomposed
at
that
and
now
gentlemen
said
alfred
since
archbold
has
had
a
private
interview
which
i
see
she
has
abused
to
poison
your
mind
against
me
i
claim
as
simple
justice
a
private
interview
to
disabuse
you
are
the
first
patient
ever
told
me
to
walk
out
of
my
own
said
archbold
rising
white
with
ire
and
apprehension
and
sweeping
out
of
the
room
by
this
piece
of
female
petulance
she
gave
the
enemy
a
point
in
the
game
for
if
she
had
insisted
on
staying
bartlett
was
far
too
weak
to
have
dismissed
her
as
it
was
he
felt
shocked
at
alfred
rudeness
and
so
small
a
thing
as
justice
did
not
in
his
idea
counterbalance
so
great
a
thing
as
discourtesy
so
he
listened
to
alfred
tale
with
the
deadly
apathy
of
an
unwilling
hearer
pour
on
i
will
endure
as
poor
lear
says
as
for
terry
he
was
pictorial
but
null
effete
emptied
of
brains
by
if
he
had
been
detained
that
day
at
drayton
house
and
frank
beverley
sent
back
in
his
place
to
whitehall
it
would
have
mattered
little
to
him
less
to
the
nation
and
nothing
to
mankind
at
last
bartlett
gave
alfred
some
hopes
he
was
taking
in
the
truth
for
he
tore
a
leaf
out
of
his
wrote
on
it
and
passed
it
to
terry
the
ancient
took
it
with
a
smile
and
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
master
it
but
failed
it
dropped
simultaneously
from
his
finger
and
his
mind
not
a
question
was
put
to
alfred
so
he
was
fain
to
come
to
an
end
he
withdrew
suddenly
and
caught
archbold
at
the
keyhole
noble
adversary
said
he
and
stalked
away
and
hid
himself
hard
by
and
no
sooner
did
the
inspectors
come
out
and
leave
the
coast
clear
than
he
darted
in
and
looked
for
the
paper
bartlett
had
passed
to
terry
he
found
it
on
the
floor
and
took
it
eagerly
up
and
full
of
hope
and
expectation
read
these
words
what
is
the
name
of
the
stuff
the
matron
gown
is
made
of
i
should
like
to
buy
bartlett
one
like
it
alfred
stood
and
read
this
again
and
again
he
searched
for
some
hidden
symbolical
meaning
in
the
words
and
deeply
impressed
with
his
own
wrongs
he
could
not
conceive
a
respectable
man
paid
fifteen
hundred
a
year
to
spy
out
wrongs
being
so
heartless
hard
as
to
write
this
single
comment
during
the
earnest
recital
of
a
wrong
so
gigantic
as
his
poor
alfred
learned
this
to
his
cost
that
to
put
small
men
into
great
places
is
to
create
monsters
when
he
had
realised
the
bitter
truth
he
put
the
paper
in
his
pocket
crept
into
the
yard
and
sat
down
and
for
all
he
could
do
scalding
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
homunculi
quanti
sunt
he
sobbed
homunculi
quanti
sunt
presently
he
saw
terry
come
wandering
towards
him
alone
the
archbold
had
not
deigned
to
make
him
safe
senectitude
had
done
that
alfred
all
heart
sick
as
he
was
went
to
the
old
gentleman
out
of
veneration
for
the
outside
of
his
head
which
was
shakespearian
and
pity
for
his
bodily
infirmity
and
offered
him
an
arm
the
doctor
thanked
him
sweetly
and
said
pray
young
man
have
you
anything
to
communicate
then
alfred
saw
that
the
ancient
man
had
already
forgotten
his
face
and
so
looking
at
him
with
that
rare
instrument
of
official
inspection
the
naked
eye
had
seen
he
was
sane
and
consequently
taken
him
for
a
keeper
how
swiftly
the
mind
can
roam
and
from
what
a
distance
gather
the
materials
of
a
thought
flashed
like
lightning
through
alfred
mind
this
line
from
one
of
his
pets
the
greek
philosophers
greek
text
and
this
is
the
greatest
stroke
of
art
to
turn
an
evil
into
a
now
the
feebleness
of
this
aged
inspector
was
an
evil
the
thing
then
was
to
turn
it
into
a
good
shade
of
plato
behold
how
thy
disciple
worked
thee
sir
said
he
sinking
his
voice
mysteriously
i
have
but
i
am
a
poor
man
you
wo
say
i
told
you
it
as
much
as
my
place
is
confidence
strict
confidence
replied
nestor
going
over
beaten
tracks
for
he
had
kept
many
a
queer
secret
with
the
loyalty
which
does
his
profession
so
much
honour
then
sir
there
a
young
gentleman
confined
here
who
is
no
more
mad
than
you
and
i
and
never
was
you
do
say
that
i
do
sir
and
they
know
they
are
doing
wrong
sir
for
they
stop
all
his
letters
to
the
commissioners
and
that
is
unlawful
you
know
would
you
like
to
take
a
note
of
it
all
sir
the
old
fogie
said
he
thought
he
should
and
groped
vaguely
for
his
he
extracted
it
at
last
like
a
loose
tooth
fumbled
with
it
and
dropped
it
alfred
picked
it
up
fuming
inwardly
the
ancient
went
to
write
but
his
fingers
were
weak
and
hesitating
and
by
this
time
he
had
half
forgotten
what
he
was
going
to
say
voice
quavered
with
impatience
but
he
fought
it
down
and
offered
as
coolly
as
he
could
to
write
it
for
him
the
offer
was
accepted
and
he
wrote
down
in
a
feigned
hand
very
clear
drayton
house
a
sane
patient
alfred
hardie
confined
here
from
interested
motives
has
written
four
letters
to
the
commissioners
all
believed
to
be
intercepted
communicated
to
me
in
confidence
by
an
attendant
in
the
house
refer
to
the
party
himself
and
his
correspondence
with
the
commissioners
from
wycherley
also
to
thomas
wales
another
attendant
and
to
wycherley
also
to
eskell
and
abbott
commissioners
of
after
this
stroke
of
address
alfred
took
the
first
opportunity
of
leaving
him
and
sent
frank
beverley
to
him
thus
alfred
alarmed
by
the
hatred
of
archbold
and
racked
with
jealousy
exerted
all
his
intelligence
and
played
many
cards
for
liberty
one
he
kept
in
reserve
and
a
trump
card
too
having
now
no
ink
nor
colouring
matter
he
did
not
hesitate
but
out
penknife
up
sleeve
and
drew
blood
from
his
arm
and
with
it
wrote
once
more
to
the
commissioners
but
kept
this
letter
hidden
for
an
ingenious
purpose
what
that
purpose
was
my
reader
shall
divine
chapter
xlii
we
left
julia
dodd
a
district
visitor
working
in
a
dense
parish
she
learned
the
depths
of
human
misery
bodily
and
mental
she
visited
an
honest
widow
so
poor
that
she
could
not
afford
a
farthing
dip
but
sat
in
the
dark
when
friends
came
to
see
her
they
sometimes
brought
a
candle
to
talk
by
she
visited
a
cripple
who
often
thanked
god
sincerely
for
leaving
her
the
use
of
one
thumb
she
visited
a
poor
creature
who
for
sixteen
years
had
been
afflicted
with
a
tumour
in
the
neck
and
had
lain
all
those
years
on
her
back
with
her
head
in
a
plate
the
heat
of
a
pillow
being
intolerable
julia
found
her
longing
to
go
and
yet
content
to
stay
and
praising
god
in
all
the
lulls
of
that
pain
which
was
her
companion
day
and
night
but
were
i
to
enumerate
the
ghastly
sights
the
stifling
loathsome
odours
the
vulgar
horrors
upon
horrors
this
refined
young
lady
faced
few
of
my
readers
would
endure
on
paper
for
love
of
truth
what
she
endured
in
reality
for
love
of
suffering
humanity
and
of
him
whose
servant
she
aspired
to
be
probably
such
sacrifices
of
selfish
ease
and
comfort
are
never
quite
in
vain
they
tend
in
many
ways
to
heal
our
own
wounds
i
wo
say
that
bodily
suffering
is
worse
than
mental
but
it
is
realised
far
more
vividly
by
a
spectator
the
grim
sights
she
saw
arrayed
julia
conscience
against
her
own
grief
the
more
so
when
she
found
some
of
her
most
afflicted
ones
resigned
and
even
grateful
what
said
she
can
they
all
rags
disease
and
suffering
bow
so
cheerfully
to
the
will
of
heaven
and
have
i
the
wickedness
the
impudence
to
repine
and
then
happier
than
most
district
visitors
she
was
not
always
obliged
to
look
on
helpless
or
to
confine
her
consolations
to
good
words
dodd
was
getting
on
famously
in
her
groove
she
was
high
in
the
confidence
of
cross
and
and
was
inspecting
eighty
ladies
as
well
as
working
her
salary
and
profits
together
were
not
less
than
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
her
one
luxury
was
charity
and
julia
its
minister
she
carried
a
good
honest
basket
and
there
you
might
see
her
bible
wedged
in
with
wine
and
meat
and
tea
and
sugar
and
still
as
these
melted
in
her
round
a
little
spark
of
something
warm
would
sometimes
come
in
her
own
sick
heart
thus
by
degrees
she
was
attaining
not
earthly
happiness
but
a
grave
and
pensive
composure
yet
across
it
gusts
of
earthly
grief
came
sweeping
often
but
these
she
hid
till
she
was
herself
again
to
her
mother
and
brother
she
was
kinder
sweeter
and
dearer
if
possible
than
ever
they
looked
on
her
as
a
saint
but
she
knew
better
and
used
to
blush
with
honest
shame
when
they
called
her
so
oh
do
pray
do
she
would
say
with
unaffected
pain
love
me
as
if
i
was
an
angel
but
do
not
praise
me
that
turns
my
eyes
inward
and
makes
me
see
myself
i
am
not
a
christian
yet
nor
anything
like
returning
one
day
from
her
duties
very
tired
she
sat
down
to
take
off
her
bonnet
in
her
own
room
and
presently
heard
snatches
of
an
argument
that
made
her
prick
those
wonderful
little
ears
of
hers
which
could
almost
hear
through
a
wall
the
two
concluding
sentences
were
a
key
to
the
whole
dialogue
why
disturb
her
said
dodd
she
is
getting
better
of
wretch
and
my
advice
is
say
nothing
what
harm
can
that
do
but
then
it
is
so
unfair
so
ungenerous
to
keep
anything
from
the
poor
girl
that
may
concern
at
this
moment
julia
came
softly
into
the
room
with
her
curiosity
hidden
under
an
air
of
angelic
composure
her
mother
asked
after
beecher
to
draw
her
into
conversation
she
replied
quietly
that
beecher
was
no
better
but
very
thankful
for
the
wine
dodd
had
sent
her
this
answer
given
she
went
without
any
apparent
hurry
and
sat
by
edward
and
fixed
two
loving
imploring
eyes
on
him
in
silence
oh
subtle
sex
this
feather
was
to
turn
the
scale
and
make
him
talk
unquestioned
it
told
she
was
close
to
him
too
and
mamma
at
the
end
of
the
room
look
here
ju
said
he
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
we
two
have
always
been
friends
as
well
as
brother
and
sister
and
somehow
it
does
not
seem
like
a
friend
to
keep
things
dark
then
to
dodd
she
is
not
a
child
mother
after
all
and
how
can
it
be
wrong
to
tell
her
the
truth
or
right
to
suppress
the
truth
well
then
ju
there
an
advertisement
in
the
and
it
a
regular
riddle
now
mind
i
do
really
think
there
is
anything
in
it
but
it
is
a
droll
coincidence
very
droll
if
it
was
there
are
ladies
present
and
one
of
them
a
district
visitor
i
would
say
d
d
droll
so
droll
continued
he
getting
warm
that
i
should
like
to
punch
the
advertiser
let
me
see
it
dear
said
julia
i
dare
say
it
is
nothing
worth
punching
there
said
edward
i
marked
julia
took
the
paper
and
her
eye
fell
on
this
short
advertisement
aileen
distrust
appearances
looking
at
her
with
some
anxiety
they
saw
the
paper
give
one
sharp
rustle
in
her
hands
and
then
quiver
a
little
she
bowed
her
head
over
it
and
everything
seemed
to
swim
but
she
never
moved
they
could
neither
of
them
see
her
face
she
defended
herself
with
the
paper
the
letters
cleared
again
and
still
hiding
her
face
she
studied
and
studied
the
advertisement
come
tell
us
what
you
think
of
it
said
edward
is
it
anything
or
a
mere
coincidence
it
is
a
pure
coincidence
said
dodd
with
an
admirable
imitation
of
cool
confidence
julia
said
nothing
but
she
now
rose
and
put
both
arms
round
neck
and
kissed
him
fervidly
again
and
again
holding
the
newspaper
tight
all
the
time
there
said
dodd
see
what
you
have
oh
it
is
all
right
said
edward
cheerfully
the
british
fireman
is
getting
hugged
no
end
why
what
is
the
matter
have
you
got
the
hiccough
ju
no
no
you
are
a
true
brother
i
knew
all
along
that
he
would
explain
all
if
he
was
alive
and
he
is
so
saying
she
kissed
the
violently
more
than
once
then
fluttered
away
with
it
to
her
own
room
ashamed
to
show
her
joy
and
yet
not
able
to
hide
it
dodd
shook
her
head
sorrowfully
and
edward
began
to
look
rueful
and
doubt
whether
he
had
done
wisely
i
omit
the
discussion
that
followed
but
the
next
time
his
duties
permitted
him
to
visit
them
dodd
showed
him
the
in
her
turn
and
with
her
pretty
white
taper
finger
and
such
a
look
pointed
to
the
following
advertisement
aileen
i
distrust
appearances
but
if
you
ever
loved
me
explain
them
at
once
i
have
something
for
you
from
your
dear
sister
poor
simple
girl
said
dodd
not
to
see
that
if
he
could
explain
at
all
he
explain
not
go
advertising
an
enigma
after
acting
a
mystification
and
to
think
of
my
innocent
dove
putting
in
that
she
had
something
for
him
from
his
sister
a
mighty
temptation
for
such
a
wretch
it
was
wonderfully
silly
said
edward
and
such
a
clever
girl
too
but
you
ladies
ca
stick
to
one
thing
at
a
time
begging
your
pardon
dodd
took
no
notice
of
this
remark
to
see
her
lower
herself
so
she
said
oh
my
son
i
am
and
dodd
leaned
her
cheek
against
edward
and
sighed
now
do
you
cry
mammy
said
he
sorrowfully
i
break
every
bone
in
his
skin
for
your
heaven
forbid
cried
dodd
anxiously
what
are
you
not
aware
she
would
hate
you
hate
me
her
brother
she
would
hate
us
all
if
we
laid
a
finger
on
that
wretch
pray
interfere
no
more
love
foolish
child
talking
to
me
about
women
and
it
is
plain
you
know
nothing
of
their
hearts
and
a
good
thing
she
then
put
on
maternal
authority
nobody
could
do
it
more
easily
and
solemnly
forbade
all
violence
he
did
not
venture
to
contradict
her
now
but
cherished
his
resolution
all
the
more
and
longed
for
the
hour
when
he
might
take
the
wretch
by
the
throat
and
chastise
him
the
more
publicly
the
better
now
the
above
incident
that
revealed
julia
real
heart
which
she
had
been
hiding
more
or
less
all
this
time
from
those
who
could
not
sympathise
with
her
took
eventually
a
turn
unfavourable
to
the
so
he
might
well
be
called
her
great
and
settled
fear
had
always
been
that
alfred
was
dead
under
the
immediate
influence
of
his
father
cunning
she
had
for
a
moment
believed
he
was
false
but
so
true
and
loving
a
heart
could
not
rest
in
that
opinion
in
true
love
so
long
as
there
is
one
grain
of
uncertainty
there
is
a
world
of
faith
and
credulous
ingenuity
so
as
alfred
had
never
been
seen
since
as
nobody
could
say
he
was
married
to
another
there
was
a
grain
of
uncertainty
as
to
his
unfaithfulness
and
this
her
true
heart
magnified
to
a
mountain
but
now
matters
wore
another
face
she
was
sure
he
had
written
the
advertisement
who
but
he
out
of
the
few
that
take
the
words
of
any
song
to
heart
admired
aileen
aroon
who
but
he
out
of
the
three
or
four
people
who
might
possibly
care
for
that
old
song
had
appearances
to
explain
away
and
who
but
he
knew
they
took
in
the
advertiser
she
waited
then
for
the
explanation
she
had
invited
she
read
the
advertising
column
every
day
over
and
over
not
a
word
more
then
her
womanly
pride
was
deeply
wounded
what
had
she
courted
an
explanation
where
most
ladies
would
have
listened
to
none
and
courted
it
in
vain
her
high
spirit
revolted
her
heart
swelled
against
the
repeated
insults
she
had
received
this
last
one
filled
the
bitter
cup
too
high
and
then
her
mother
came
in
and
assured
her
he
had
only
inserted
that
advertisement
to
keep
her
in
his
power
he
has
heard
you
are
recovering
and
are
admired
by
others
more
worthy
of
your
esteem
julia
cried
bitterly
at
these
arguments
for
she
could
no
longer
combat
them
and
hurd
was
very
attentive
and
kind
and
when
he
spoke
to
julia
and
julia
turned
away
her
eye
was
sure
to
meet
dodd
eye
imploring
her
secretly
not
to
discourage
the
young
man
too
much
and
so
she
was
gently
pulled
by
one
and
gently
thrust
by
another
away
from
her
first
lover
and
towards
his
successor
it
is
an
old
old
story
fate
seems
to
exhaust
its
malice
on
our
first
love
for
the
second
the
road
is
smoother
matters
went
on
so
some
weeks
and
it
was
perfectly
true
that
hurd
escorted
both
ladies
one
day
to
drayton
house
at
julia
request
and
not
dodd
indeed
the
latter
lady
was
secretly
hurt
at
his
being
allowed
to
come
with
them
one
saturday
afternoon
dodd
went
alone
to
drayton
house
by
appointment
david
was
like
a
lamb
but
as
usual
had
no
knowledge
of
her
archbold
told
her
a
quiet
intelligent
patient
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
him
and
she
thought
this
was
adding
much
to
his
happiness
may
i
see
him
to
thank
him
asked
dodd
oh
certainly
said
archbold
i
inquire
for
she
went
out
but
soon
returned
saying
he
is
gone
out
for
a
walk
with
the
head
keeper
we
give
him
as
much
air
and
amusement
as
we
can
we
hope
soon
to
send
him
out
altogether
truly
kind
and
thoughtful
said
dodd
soon
after
she
kissed
archbold
and
pressed
a
valuable
brooch
upon
her
and
then
took
leave
however
at
the
gate
she
remembered
her
parasol
archbold
said
she
would
go
back
for
it
dodd
would
not
hear
of
that
archbold
insisted
and
settled
the
question
by
going
she
was
no
sooner
in
the
house
than
young
frank
beverley
came
running
to
dodd
and
put
the
missing
parasol
officiously
into
her
hand
oh
thank
you
sir
said
she
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
archbold
i
have
and
with
this
they
parted
and
the
porter
opened
the
gate
to
her
and
she
got
into
her
hired
cab
she
leaned
her
head
back
and
as
usual
was
lost
in
the
sorrowful
thoughts
of
what
had
been
and
what
now
was
poor
wife
each
visit
to
drayton
house
opened
her
wound
afresh
on
reaching
the
stones
there
was
a
turnpike
this
roused
her
up
she
took
out
her
purse
and
paid
it
as
she
drew
back
to
her
seat
she
saw
out
of
the
tail
of
her
feminine
eye
the
edge
of
something
white
under
her
parasol
she
took
up
the
parasol
and
found
a
written
paper
pinned
on
to
it
she
detached
this
paper
and
examined
it
all
over
with
considerable
curiosity
it
consisted
of
a
long
slip
about
an
inch
and
a
quarter
broad
rolled
like
tape
and
tied
with
packthread
she
could
not
see
the
inside
of
course
but
she
read
the
superscription
it
was
firmly
but
clearly
written
in
red
ink
apparently
of
the
words
i
shall
only
say
at
present
that
they
were
strong
and
simple
and
that
their
effect
on
the
swift
intelligence
and
tender
heart
of
dodd
was
overpowering
they
knocked
at
her
heart
they
drew
from
her
an
audible
cry
of
pity
more
eloquent
than
a
thousand
speeches
and
the
next
moment
she
felt
a
little
faint
for
she
knew
now
the
appeal
was
not
in
red
ink
but
in
something
very
fit
to
pass
between
the
heart
of
woe
and
the
heart
of
pity
she
smelt
at
her
salts
and
soon
recovered
that
weakness
and
next
her
womanly
bosom
swelled
so
with
the
milk
of
human
kindness
that
her
breath
came
short
after
a
little
struggle
she
gushed
out
aloud
ah
that
i
will
poor
soul
this
very
now
by
this
time
she
was
close
to
her
own
house
she
stopped
the
cab
at
her
door
and
asked
the
driver
if
his
horse
was
fresh
enough
to
carry
her
to
the
board
of
lunacy
it
is
at
whitehall
sir
said
she
lord
bless
you
said
the
cabman
whitehall
why
my
mare
would
take
you
to
whitechapel
and
back
in
an
hour
let
alone
reassured
on
that
point
dodd
went
in
just
to
give
the
servant
an
order
but
as
she
stood
in
the
passage
she
heard
her
children
voices
and
also
a
friend
the
genial
angry
tones
of
alexander
sampson
she
thought
oh
i
just
show
them
all
the
paper
before
i
go
with
it
and
so
after
a
little
buzz
about
dinner
and
things
with
sarah
mounted
the
stairs
and
arrived
among
them
singularly
as
it
happened
men
like
sampson
who
make
many
foes
do
also
make
stauncher
friends
than
ever
the
hare
does
and
are
faithful
friends
themselves
the
boisterous
doctor
had
stuck
to
the
dodds
in
all
their
distresses
and
if
they
were
ever
short
of
money
it
certainly
was
not
his
fault
for
almost
his
first
word
when
he
found
them
in
a
lodging
was
now
be
wanting
a
chick
gim
me
pen
and
ink
and
i
just
draw
ye
one
for
a
this
being
declined
politely
by
dodd
he
expostulated
mai
dear
madam
how
on
airth
can
ye
go
on
in
such
a
place
as
london
without
a
chick
he
returned
to
the
charge
at
his
next
visit
and
scolded
her
well
for
her
pride
who
iver
hard
of
refusing
a
chick
a
small
inoffensive
chick
from
an
old
friend
like
me
come
now
behave
just
a
wee
chick
i
let
y
off
for
give
us
your
company
and
your
friendship
said
dodd
we
value
them
above
gold
we
will
not
rob
your
dear
children
while
we
have
as
many
fingers
on
our
hands
as
other
on
the
present
occasion
sampson
whose
affectionate
respect
for
the
leading
london
physicians
has
already
displayed
itself
was
inveighing
specially
against
certain
specialists
whom
in
the
rapidity
of
his
lusty
eloquence
he
called
the
mad
ox
he
favoured
julia
and
edward
with
a
full
account
of
the
maniform
enormities
he
had
detected
them
in
during
thirty
years
practice
and
so
descended
to
his
present
grievance
a
lady
an
old
friend
of
his
was
being
kept
in
a
certain
asylum
month
after
month
because
she
had
got
money
and
relations
and
had
once
been
delirious
and
why
was
she
delirious
because
she
had
a
brain
fever
she
got
well
in
a
this
lady
had
thrown
a
letter
over
the
wall
addressed
to
him
somebody
had
posted
it
he
had
asked
the
commissioners
to
let
him
visit
her
they
had
declined
for
the
present
yon
board
always
sides
with
the
strong
against
the
weak
said
he
so
now
he
had
bribed
the
gardener
and
made
a
midnight
assignation
with
the
patient
and
was
going
to
it
with
six
stout
fellows
to
carry
her
off
by
force
that
is
my
recipe
for
alleged
insanity
said
he
the
business
will
be
more
like
a
mejaeval
knight
carrying
off
a
namorous
nun
out
of
a
convint
than
a
good
physician
saving
a
pashint
from
the
mad
ox
however
saampson
in
the
secret
i
daunt
say
sh
approves
it
for
she
does
she
says
quietly
to
the
board
o
commissioners
sis
i
dear
boards
are
a
sort
of
cattle
that
go
too
slow
for
saampson
and
no
match
at
all
for
the
mad
ox
at
this
conjuncture
or
soon
after
dodd
came
in
with
her
paper
in
her
hand
a
little
flurried
for
once
and
after
a
hasty
curtsey
said
oh
doctor
sampson
oh
my
dears
what
wickedness
there
is
in
the
world
i
going
to
whitehall
this
moment
only
look
at
what
was
pinned
on
my
parasol
at
drayton
the
writing
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
left
the
readers
looking
very
gravely
at
one
another
julia
was
quite
pale
and
all
were
too
deeply
moved
and
even
shocked
to
make
any
commonplace
comment
for
it
looked
and
read
like
a
cry
from
heart
to
hearts
if
you
are
a
christian
if
you
are
human
pity
a
sane
man
here
confined
in
fraud
and
take
this
to
the
board
of
lunacy
at
whitehall
torn
by
treachery
from
her
i
love
my
letters
all
intercepted
pens
and
paper
kept
from
me
i
write
this
with
a
toothpick
and
my
blood
on
a
rim
of
times
oh
god
direct
it
to
some
one
who
has
fered
and
can
feel
for
other
sampson
was
the
first
to
speak
there
said
he
under
his
breath
did
i
tell
you
this
man
is
sane
there
sanity
in
every
well
but
said
edward
do
you
mean
to
say
that
in
the
present
day
mai
dearr
sirr
mankind
niver

whativer
the
muscles
of

in
the
light
the
mind
and
conscience
of
man
will
consent
to
do
in
the
julia
said
never
a
word
dodd
too
was
for
action
not
for
talk
she
bade
them
all
a
hasty
adieu
and
went
on
her
good
work
ere
she
got
to
the
street
door
she
heard
a
swift
rustle
behind
her
and
it
was
julia
flying
down
to
her
all
glowing
and
sparkling
with
her
old
impetuosity
that
had
seemed
dead
for
ever
no
no
she
cried
panting
with
generous
emotion
it
is
to
me
it
was
sent
am
torn
from
him
i
love
and
by
some
treachery
i
dare
say
and

suffered
oh

never
know
what
i
have
suffered
give
it
oh
pray
pray
pray
give
it

it
to
chapter
xliii
if
we
could
always
know
at
the
time
what
we
are
doing
two
ladies
carried
a
paper
to
whitehall
out
of
charity
to
a
stranger
therein
the
elder
was
a
benefactress
to
a
man
she
had
never
spoken
of
but
as
the
wretch
the
younger
held
her
truant
bridegroom
heart
i
may
say
in
her
hand
all
the
road
and
was
his
protectress
neither
recognised
the
for
no
man
can
write
his
own
hand
with
a
toothpick
they
reached
whitehall
and
were
conducted
upstairs
to
a
gentleman
of
pleasant
aspect
but
powerful
brow
seated
in
a
wilderness
of
letters
he
waved
his
hand
and
a
clerk
set
them
chairs
he
soon
after
laid
down
his
pen
and
leaned
gravely
forward
to
hear
their
business
they
saw
they
must
waste
no
time
julia
looked
at
her
mother
rose
and
took
alfred
missive
to
his
desk
and
handed
it
him
with
one
of
her
eloquent
looks
grave
and
pitiful
he
seemed
struck
by
her
beauty
and
her
manner
it
was
pinned
on
my
parasol
sir
by
a
poor
prisoner
at
drayton
house
said
dodd
oh
indeed
said
the
gentleman
and
began
to
read
the
superscription
with
a
cold
and
wary
look
but
thawed
visibly
as
he
read
he
opened
the
missive
and
ran
his
eye
over
it
the
perusal
moved
him
not
a
little
a
generous
flush
mounted
to
his
brow
he
rang
the
bell
sharply
a
clerk
answered
it
the
gentleman
wrote
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
said
earnestly
bring
me
every
letter
that
is
signed
with
that
name
and
all
our
correspondence
about
he
then
turned
to
dodd
and
put
to
her
a
few
questions
which
drew
out
the
main
facts
i
have
just
related
the
papers
were
now
brought
in
excuse
me
a
moment
said
he
and
ran
over
them
i
believe
the
man
is
sane
said
he
and
that
you
will
have
enabled
us
to
baffle
a
conspiracy
a
heartless
we
do
hope
he
will
be
set
free
sir
said
dodd
piteously
he
shall
madam
if
it
is
as
i
suspect
i
will
stay
here
all
night
but
i
will
master
this
case
and
lay
it
before
the
board
myself
without
julia
looked
at
her
mother
and
then
asked
if
it
would
be
wrong
to
inquire
the
poor
gentleman
name
humph
said
the
official
i
ought
not
to
reveal
that
without
his
consent
but
stay
he
will
owe
you
much
and
it
really
seems
a
pity
he
should
not
have
an
opportunity
of
expressing
his
gratitude
perhaps
you
will
favour
me
with
your
address
and
trust
to
my
discretion
of
course
if
he
does
not
turn
out
as
sane
as
he
seems
i
shall
never
let
him
know
dodd
then
gave
her
address
and
she
and
julia
went
home
with
a
glow
about
the
heart
selfish
people
thank
heaven
never
know
unconsciously
these
two
had
dealt
their
enemy
and
alfred
a
heavy
blow
had
set
the
train
to
a
mine
their
friend
at
the
office
was
a
man
of
another
stamp
than
alfred
had
fallen
in
with
meantime
alfred
was
subjected
to
hourly
mortifications
and
irritations
he
guessed
the
motive
and
tried
to
baffle
it
by
calm
but
this
was
far
more
difficult
than
heretofore
because
his
temper
was
now
exacerbated
and
his
fibre
irritated
by
broken
sleep
of
this
poor
david
was
a
great
cause
and
his
heart
inflamed
and
poisoned
by
that
cruel
that
corroding
passion
jealousy
to
think
that
while
he
was
in
prison
a
rival
was
ever
at
his
ear
making
more
and
more
progress
in
her
heart
this
corroder
was
his
bitter
companion
day
and
night
and
perhaps
of
all
the
maddeners
human
cunning
could
have
invented
this
was
the
worst
it
made
his
temples
beat
and
his
blood
run
boiling
poison
indeed
there
were
times
when
he
was
so
distempered
by
passion
that
homicide
seemed
but
an
act
of
justice
and
suicide
a
legitimate
relief
for
who
could
go
on
for
ever
carrying
hell
in
his
bosom
up
and
down
a
prison
yard
he
began
to
go
alone
to
turn
impatiently
from
the
petty
troubles
and
fathomless
egotism
of
those
afflicted
persons
he
had
hitherto
forced
his
sore
heart
to
pity
pale
thin
and
he
walked
the
weary
gravel
like
the
lost
ones
in
that
hall
of
eblis
whose
hearts
were
a
devouring
fire
even
an
inspector
with
a
naked
eye
would
no
longer
have
distinguished
him
at
first
sight
from
a
lunatic
of
the
unhappiest
class
the
melancholiac
ipse
suum
cor
edens
hominum
vestigia
archbold
looked
on
and
saw
this
sad
sight
not
with
the
pity
it
would
once
have
caused
but
with
a
sort
of
bitter
triumph
lightened
by
no
pleasure
and
darkened
by
the
shadow
of
coming
remorse
yet
up
to
this
time
she
had
shown
none
of
that
inconstancy
of
purpose
which
marks
her
sex
while
she
did
go
far
to
justify
the
poet
charge
nor
hell
a
fury
like
a
woman
rooke
had
a
hint
to
provoke
alfred
to
violence
such
as
would
justify
them
in
subjecting
so
popular
a
patient
to
bodily
restraint
composing
draughts
and
other
quick
maddeners
rooke
entered
into
the
game
zealously
from
two
motives
he
was
devoted
to
archbold
and
he
hated
alfred
who
had
openly
defied
him
and
mortified
his
vanity
about
frank
beverley
one
saturday
alfred
was
ordered
out
to
walk
with
rooke
and
hayes
and
vulcan
he
raised
no
objection
suspected
felt
homicidal
suppressed
the
impulse
and
by
this
he
got
time
to
give
that
letter
to
beverley
with
instructions
but
all
the
walk
he
was
saying
to
himself
that
julia
was
in
the
house
and
he
was
kept
away
from
her
and
a
rival
with
her
this
made
him
sicken
and
rage
by
turns
he
came
back
in
a
state
verging
on
fury
on
entering
the
yard
poor
beverley
who
had
done
his
bit
of
cunning
and
by
reaction
now
relapsed
into
extra
simplicity
came
running
and
said
i
done
it
she
has
got
what
have
you
done
who
has
got
what
cried
rooke
do
tell
if
you
do
i
shake
your
life
out
ye
young
blackguard
cried
rooke
seizing
him
and
throttling
him
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
alfred
fury
broke
out
he
gnashed
his
teeth
and
dashed
his
fist
in
rooke
face
rooke
staggered
back
and
bellowed
with
pain
and
anger
then
rushing
at
him
incautiously
received
a
stinger
that
staggered
him
and
nearly
closed
his
right
eye
he
took
the
hint
and
put
himself
in
a
posture
that
showed
he
was
skilled
in
the
art
of
he
stopped
two
blows
neatly
and
returned
a
heavy
one
upon
the
ribs
alfred
staggered
back
some
steps
but
steadied
himself
and
as
rooke
rushed
in
too
hastily
to
improve
his
advantage
caught
him
heavily
on
the
other
eye
but
lost
his
own
balance
a
little
which
enabled
rooke
to
close
then
came
a
sharp
short
rally
of
blows
and
rooke
not
to
be
denied
got
hold
of
his
man
and
a
wrestling
bout
ensued
in
which
alfred
being
somewhat
weakened
by
misery
and
broken
rest
rooke
great
weight
and
strength
enabled
him
after
a
severe
struggle
to
fall
with
his
antagonist
under
him
and
knock
the
breath
out
of
his
body
for
the
moment
then
hayes
who
had
stood
prudently
aloof
came
in
and
helped
handcuff
him
they
could
not
walk
up
and
down
him
for
the
robin
who
stood
by
with
a
professional
air
to
see
fair
play
ah
cold
iron
is
your
best
chance
he
said
satirically
never
you
mind
sir
you
hit
quick
and
well
i
back
at
long
odds
in
the
ring
both
his
peepers
are
in
deep
he
added
a
cow
can
beat
a
man
when
alfred
was
handcuffed
they
turned
him
loose
it
soon
transpired
however
that
he
was
now
a
dangerous
maniac
formula
and
to
be
confined
in
the
noisy
ward
on
hearing
this
he
saw
the
trap
he
had
fallen
into
saw
and
trembled
he
asked
himself
what
on
earth
he
should
do
and
presently
the
saying
came
back
to
him
and
this
is
the
highest
stroke
of
art
to
turn
evil
into
he
argued
thus
wolf
love
of
money
is
my
great
evil
he
will
destroy
me
for
money
do
anything
for
money
then
suppose
i
offer
him
money
to
be
honest
he
begged
an
interview
with
wolf
on
business
this
was
accorded
at
once
he
asked
the
doctor
plump
whether
he
received
a
large
sum
to
detain
him
under
pretence
of
insanity
not
very
considering
the
trouble
you
sometimes
give
hardie
was
the
dry
reply
well
then
justice
shall
outbid
rascality
for
once
i
am
a
sane
man
and
you
know
it
a
man
of
my
word
and
you
know
it
i
give
you
a
thousand
pounds
to
let
me
out
of
this
wolf
eyes
sparkled
you
shall
have
any
bond
or
security
you
like
and
the
money
within
a
week
of
my
wolf
said
he
should
be
delighted
to
do
it
if
he
could
conscientiously
at
this
piece
of
hypocrisy
alfred
cheek
reddened
and
he
could
not
speak
well
well
i
do
see
a
great
change
in
you
for
the
better
said
wolf
if
as
i
suspect
you
are
convalescent
i
will
part
with
you
without
a
thousand
pounds
or
a
thousand
alfred
stared
had
he
mistaken
his
man
i
tell
you
what
though
said
the
smooth
doctor
i
have
got
two
pictures
one
by
raphael
one
by
i
know
them
said
the
alfred
they
are
worth
more
than
a
thousand
of
course
they
are
but
i
would
take
a
thousand
pounds
from
throw
me
in
my
liberty
and
i
make
it
we
will
see
about
and
with
this
understanding
the
men
of
business
parted
wolf
consulted
archbold
then
and
there
impossible
said
she
the
law
would
dissolve
such
a
bargain
and
you
would
be
exposed
and
but
a
thousand
pounds
said
the
poor
doctor
oh
he
offered
me
more
than
that
said
archbold
you
do
mean
to
say
so
when
was
that
do
you
remember
one
sunday
that
i
walked
him
out
to
keep
clear
of
dodd
have
you
not
observed
that
i
have
not
repeated
the
experiment
yes
but
i
really
do
know
will
you
promise
me
faithfully
not
to
take
any
notice
if
i
tell
you
the
doctor
promised
then
she
owned
to
him
with
manifest
reluctance
that
alfred
had
taken
advantage
of
her
kindness
her
indiscretion
in
walking
alone
with
him
and
made
passionate
love
to
her
he
offered
me
not
a
thousand
pounds
said
she
but
his
whole
fortune
and
his
heart
if
i
would
fly
with
him
from
odious
walls
that
was
his
then
seeing
out
of
a
corner
of
her
eye
that
the
doctor
was
turning
almost
green
with
jealousy
this
artist
proceeded
to
describe
the
love
scene
between
her
and
alfred
with
feigned
hesitation
yet
minute
detail
only
she
inverted
the
parts
alfred
in
her
glowing
page
made
the
hot
love
she
listened
abashed
confused
and
tried
all
she
could
think
of
to
bring
him
to
better
sentiments
she
concluded
this
chapter
of
history
inverted
with
a
sigh
and
said
so
now
he
hates
me
i
believe
poor
do
you
regret
your
refusal
asked
wolf
uneasily
oh
no
my
dear
friend
of
course
my
judgment
says
that
few
women
at
my
age
and
in
my
position
would
have
refused
but
we
poor
women
seldom
go
by
our
and
she
cast
a
tender
look
down
at
the
doctor
feet
in
short
she
worked
on
him
so
that
he
left
alfred
at
her
disposition
and
was
no
sooner
gone
to
his
other
asylum
six
miles
off
than
the
calumniated
was
conducted
by
hayes
and
rooke
through
passage
after
passage
and
door
after
door
to
a
wing
of
the
building
connected
with
the
main
part
only
by
a
covered
way
as
they
neared
it
strange
noises
became
audible
faint
at
first
they
got
louder
and
louder
singing
roaring
howling
like
wolves
alfred
flesh
began
to
creep
he
stopped
at
the
covered
way
he
would
have
fought
to
his
last
gasp
sooner
than
go
further
but
he
was
handcuffed
he
appealed
to
the
keepers
but
he
had
used
them
both
too
roughly
they
snarled
and
forced
him
on
and
shut
him
into
a
common
flagged
cell
with
a
filthy
in
it
and
all
the
vessels
of
here
he
was
surrounded
by
the
desperate
order
of
maniacs
he
at
present
scarcely
knew
but
by
report
throughout
that
awful
night
he
could
never
close
his
eyes
for
the
horrible
unearthly
sounds
that
assailed
him
singing
swearing
howling
like
wild
beasts
his
neighbour
reasoned
high
of
faith
and
works
ending
each
pious
argument
with
a
sudden
rhapsody
of
oaths
and
never
slept
a
wink
his
neighbour
alternately
sang
and
shouted
cain
was
a
murderer
cain
was
a
murderer
and
howled
like
a
wolf
making
night
hideous
his
opposite
neighbour
had
an
audience
and
every
now
and
then
delivered
in
a
high
nasal
key
let
us
curse
and
pray
varying
it
sometimes
thus
brethren
let
us
work
double
and
then
he
would
deliver
a
long
fervent
prayer
and
follow
it
up
immediately
with
a
torrent
of
blasphemies
so
terrific
that
coming
in
such
a
contrast
they
made
alfred
body
wet
with
perspiration
to
hear
a
poor
creature
so
defy
his
creator
no
rest
no
peace
when
it
was
still
the
place
was
like
the
grave
and
ever
and
anon
loud
sharp
tremendous
burst
a
thunderclap
of
curses
and
set
those
poor
demented
creatures
all
yelling
again
for
making
the
tombs
ring
and
at
intervals
a
harmless
but
dirty
idiot
who
was
allowed
to
roam
the
ward
came
and
chanted
through
the
keyhole
everything
is
nothing
and
nothing
is
this
was
the
only
observation
he
had
made
for
many
years
his
ears
assailed
with
horrors
of
which
you
have
literally
no
conception
or
shadow
of
a
conception
his
nose
poisoned
with
ammoniacal
vapours
and
the
peculiar
smell
that
marks
the
true
maniac
alfred
ran
wildly
about
his
cell
trying
to
stop
his
ears
and
trembling
for
his
own
reason
when
the
fearful
night
rolled
away
and
morning
broke
and
he
could
stand
on
his
and
see
the
sweet
on
a
square
yard
of
grass
level
with
his
prison
bars
it
refreshed
his
very
soul
and
affected
him
almost
to
tears
he
was
then
to
his
surprise
taken
out
and
allowed
to
have
a
warm
bath
and
to
breakfast
with
david
and
the
rest
but
i
suspect
it
was
done
to
watch
the
effect
of
the
trial
he
had
been
submitted
to
after
breakfast
having
now
no
place
to
go
he
lay
on
a
bench
and
there
exhausted
nature
overpowered
him
and
he
fell
fast
asleep
archbold
came
by
on
purpose
and
saw
him
he
looked
very
pale
and
peaceful
there
was
a
cut
on
his
forehead
due
to
rooke
knuckles
archbold
looked
down
and
the
young
figure
and
haughty
face
seemed
so
unresisting
and
peaceful
sad
she
half
relented
and
shed
some
bitter
tears
that
did
not
however
prevent
her
setting
her
female
spies
to
watch
him
more
closely
than
ever
he
awoke
cold
but
refreshed
and
found
little
beverley
standing
by
him
with
wet
eyes
alfred
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
like
a
captive
monarch
to
his
faithful
vassal
they
sha
put
you
in
the
noisy
ward
again
sobbed
frank
this
is
your
last
night
hy
frank
you
rascal
my
boots
roared
rooke
from
an
open
window
coming
sir
coming
alfred
next
visitor
was
the
robin
he
came
whispering
it
is
all
right
with
garrett
sir
and
he
has
got
a
key
of
the
back
gate
but
you
must
get
back
to
your
old
room
or
we
ca
would
to
heaven
i
could
robin
another
night
or
two
in
the
noisy
ward
will
drive
me
mad
i
well
sir
i
tell
you
what
you
do
which
we
all
have
to
do
it
at
odd
times
hold
a
candle
to
the
devil
here
she
comes
i
think
she
is
everywhere
all
at
one
the
robin
then
sauntered
away
affecting
nonchalance
and
alfred
proceeded
to
hold
the
candle
as
directed
mrs
archbold
said
he
timidly
rising
from
his
seat
at
her
approach
sir
said
she
haughtily
and
affecting
surprise
i
have
a
favour
to
ask
you
madam
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
let
me
go
back
to
my
room
what
you
have
found
i
am
not
so
powerless
as
you
thought
i
find
myself
so
weak
and
you
so
powerful
that
you
can
afford
to
be
i
have
no
more
power
over
you
than
you
have
over
i
wish
it
was
i
prove
it
said
she
who
has
got
the
key
of
your
room
hayes
she
whistled
and
sent
for
him
and
gave
him
the
requisite
order
before
alfred
alfred
thanked
her
warmly
she
smiled
and
went
away
disposed
to
change
her
tactics
and
having
shown
him
how
she
could
torment
try
soothing
means
and
open
his
heart
by
gratitude
but
presently
looking
out
of
her
window
she
saw
the
robin
and
him
together
and
somehow
they
seemed
to
her
subtle
observant
eyes
to
be
plotting
the
very
suspicion
was
fatal
to
that
officer
his
discharge
was
determined
on
meantime
she
set
her
spies
to
watch
him
and
tell
her
if
they
saw
or
heard
anything
now
archbold
was
going
out
to
tea
that
evening
and
as
soon
as
ever
this
transpired
the
keepers
secretly
invited
the
keeperesses
to
a
party
in
the
patients
this
was
a
rare
opportunity
and
the
robin
and
garrett
put
their
heads
together
accordingly
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
the
robin
took
an
opportunity
and
slipped
a
new
key
of
the
back
gate
into
alfred
hand
and
told
him
the
trick
was
to
be
done
that
very
night
he
was
to
get
thompson
to
go
to
bed
early
and
instead
of
taking
off
his
clothes
was
to
wait
in
readiness
we
have
been
plying
hayes
already
said
the
robin
and
as
soon
as
is
off
we
shall
hocuss
him
and
get
the
key
and
while
they
are
all
larking
in
the
off
you
go
to
oh
you
dear
robin
you
have
taken
my
breath
away
but
how
about
vulcan
oh
we
know
how
to
make
him
amiable
a
a
friend
of
mine
has
provided
the
ondeniable
where
dogs
is
concerned
whereby
garrett
draws
the
varmint
into
the
scullery
and
shuts
him
in
while
i
get
the
key
from
the
other
all
ah
robin
said
alfred
it
sounds
too
good
to
be
true
what
this
my
last
day
here
the
minutes
seemed
to
creep
very
slowly
till
eight
came
then
he
easily
persuaded
david
to
go
to
bed
hayes
went
up
and
unlocked
the
door
for
them
it
closed
with
a
hayes
was
drunk
but
full
of
discipline
and
insisted
on
the
patients
putting
out
their
clothes
so
alfred
made
up
a
bundle
from
his
portmanteau
and
threw
it
out
hayes
eyed
it
suspiciously
but
was
afraid
to
stoop
and
inspect
it
closer
for
his
drunken
instinct
told
him
he
would
pitch
on
his
head
that
moment
so
he
retired
grumbling
and
dangling
his
key
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
he
met
archbold
full
dressed
and
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
she
held
the
candle
up
and
inspected
him
and
a
little
conversation
followed
that
sobered
hayes
for
a
minute
or
two
archbold
was
no
sooner
gone
to
her
little
than
all
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
sent
to
bed
to
get
a
good
sleep
for
the
good
of
their
health
and
the
keepers
and
keeperesses
took
their
place
and
romped
and
made
such
a
row
sleep
was
not
easy
within
hearing
of
them
they
sat
on
the
piano
they
sang
songs
to
a
drum
accompaniment
played
on
the
table
they
danced
drank
flirted
and
enjoyed
themselves
like
schoolboys
hayes
alone
was
gloomy
and
morose
so
the
robin
and
garrett
consoled
him
drank
with
him
and
soothed
him
with
the
balm
of
insensibility
in
which
condition
they
removed
him
under
charitable
pretences
and
searched
his
pockets
in
the
passage
for
the
key
of
alfred
room
to
their
infinite
surprise
and
disappointment
it
was
not
upon
him
the
fact
is
archbold
had
snatched
it
from
him
in
her
wrath
and
put
it
in
her
own
pocket
how
far
her
suspicions
went
how
much
her
spies
had
discovered
i
really
do
know
but
somehow
or
other
she
was
uneasy
in
her
mind
and
seeing
hayes
in
such
a
state
she
would
not
trust
him
during
her
absence
but
took
the
key
away
with
her
the
robin
and
garrett
knew
nothing
of
this
and
were
all
abroad
but
they
thought
rooke
must
have
the
key
so
they
proceeded
to
drink
with
him
and
were
just
about
to
administer
a
really
effective
soporific
in
his
grog
when
they
and
all
the
merry
party
were
suddenly
startled
by
violent
ringing
at
the
bell
and
thundering
and
halloaing
at
the
hall
door
the
men
jumped
to
their
feet
and
balanced
themselves
and
looked
half
wild
half
stupid
the
women
sat
and
began
to
scream
for
they
had
heard
a
word
that
has
terrors
for
us
all
peculiar
terrors
for
them
this
alarm
was
due
to
a
personage
hitherto
undervalued
in
the
establishment
francis
beverley
had
been
thinking
so
now
finding
all
the
patients
boxed
up
and
their
attendants
romping
in
the
he
lighted
seven
fires
skilfully
on
the
whole
for
practice
makes
perfect
but
singular
oversight
he
omitted
one
essential
ingredient
in
the
fire
and
that
was
the
grate
to
be
plain
francis
made
seven
bonfires
of
chairs
and
other
combustibles
in
the
servants
garrets
lighted
them
contemporaneously
and
retired
to
the
basement
convinced
he
had
taken
the
surest
means
to
deliver
his
friend
out
of
drayton
house
and
with
a
certain
want
of
candour
that
characterises
the
weak
proceeded
to
black
his
other
bad
master
shoes
with
singular
assiduity
there
was
no
wind
to
blow
the
flame
but
it
was
a
clear
frost
and
soon
fiery
tongues
shot
out
of
three
into
the
night
and
lurid
gleams
burnished
four
more
and
the
old
house
was
burning
merrily
overhead
and
ringing
with
hilarity
on
the
first
floor
but
the
neighbours
saw
pointed
wondered
comprehended
shouted
rang
knocked
and
surged
round
the
iron
gate
fire
fire
fire
and
fire
went
down
the
road
and
men
on
horseback
galloped
for
engines
and
the
porter
opened
and
the
people
rushed
in
and
hammered
at
the
hall
doors
and
when
rooke
ran
down
and
opened
fire
was
the
word
that
met
him
from
a
score
of
eager
throats
and
glittering
eyes
fire
where
he
cried
where
why
are
on
fire
blazing
he
ran
out
and
looked
up
at
the
tongues
of
flame
and
volleys
of
smoke
shut
the
gate
he
roared
call
the
police
fire
fire
and
he
dashed
back
and
calling
to
the
other
keepers
to
unlock
all
the
doors
they
had
keys
of
ran
up
to
the
garrets
to
see
what
could
be
done
he
came
out
at
what
he
saw
he
descended
hastily
to
the
third
floor
now
the
third
floor
of
that
wing
was
occupied
principally
by
servants
in
fact
the
only
patients
at
that
time
were
dodd
and
alfred
rooke
called
to
the
men
below
to
send
hayes
up
to
no
with
his
key
directly
he
then
ran
down
to
the
next
floor
of
which
he
had
keys
and
opened
all
the
doors
and
said
to
the
inmates
with
a
ghastly
attempt
at
cheerfulness
belied
by
his
shaking
voice
get
up
gentlemen
there
is
a
ball
and
supper
going
on
he
was
afraid
to
utter
the
word
fire
to
them
the
other
keepers
were
as
rapid
each
on
his
beat
and
soon
the
more
rational
patients
took
the
alarm
and
were
persuaded
or
driven
out
into
the
yard
where
they
cowered
together
in
extremity
of
fear
for
the
fire
began
to
roar
overhead
like
a
lion
and
lighted
up
the
whole
interior
red
and
bright
all
was
screaming
and
confusion
and
then
came
a
struggle
to
get
the
incurable
out
from
the
basement
story
there
was
no
time
to
handcuff
them
the
keepers
trusted
to
the
terror
of
the
scene
to
cow
them
and
so
opened
the
doors
and
got
them
out
anyhow
wild
weird
forms
with
glaring
eyes
and
matted
hair
leaped
out
and
ran
into
the
hall
and
laughed
and
danced
and
cursed
in
the
lurid
reflection
of
the
fires
above
hell
seemed
discharging
demons
men
recoiled
from
them
and
well
they
did
for
now
the
skylight
exploded
and
the
pieces
fell
tinkling
on
the
marble
hall
fast
as
hail
the
crowd
recoiled
and
ran
but
those
awful
figures
continued
their
gambols
one
picked
up
the
burning
glass
and
ground
it
in
his
hands
that
bled
directly
but
he
felt
neither
burn
nor
cut
the
keepers
rushed
in
to
withdraw
them
from
so
dangerous
a
place
all
but
one
obeyed
with
sudden
tameness
that
one
struggled
and
yelled
like
a
demon
in
the
midst
of
which
fearful
contest
came
a
sudden
thundering
at
a
door
on
the
third
floor
what
is
that
cried
rooke
it
is
hardie
screamed
the
robin
you
have
left
him
locked
i
told
hayes
to
let
him
out
long
but
hayes
has
got
the
key
you
got
no
no
i
tell
you
hayes
has
got
no
no
murder
murder
they
are
dead
men
run
for
archbold
somebody
run
here
hammers
hammers
for
god
sake
come
and
help
me
break
the
door
oh
rooke
rooke
as
i
a
man
hayes
has
got
the
key
cried
rooke
stamping
on
the
ground
and
white
with
terror
by
this
time
garrett
had
got
a
hammer
and
he
and
wales
rushed
wildly
up
the
stairs
to
batter
in
the
strong
door
if
they
could
they
got
to
the
third
floor
but
with
difficulty
the
smoke
began
to
blind
them
and
choke
them
and
fiery
showers
fell
on
them
and
drove
them
back
smarting
and
choking
garrett
sank
down
gasping
at
the
wales
ran
into
the
yard
uttering
pitiful
cries
and
pointing
wildly
upwards
but
before
he
got
there
a
hand
had
broken
through
the
glass
of
a
window
up
in
the
third
floor
the
poor
white
hand
of
a
perishing
prisoner
and
clutched
the
framework
and
tore
at
it
at
this
hand
a
thousand
white
faces
were
now
upturned
amid
groans
of
pity
and
terror
such
as
only
multitudes
can
utter
suddenly
those
anxious
faces
and
glistening
eyes
turned
like
one
for
an
attempt
wild
and
unintelligible
but
still
an
attempt
was
about
to
be
made
to
save
that
hand
and
its
owner
out
of
the
very
jaws
of
death
now
amongst
the
spectators
was
one
whose
life
and
reason
were
at
stake
on
that
attempt
dodd
was
hurrying
homeward
from
this
very
neighbourhood
when
the
fire
broke
out
her
son
edward
was
coming
at
nine
to
tea
and
better
still
to
sleep
he
was
leaving
the
fire
brigade
it
had
disappointed
him
he
found
the
men
saved
the
lives
the
firemen
only
the
property
he
had
gone
into
the
business
earnestly
too
he
had
invented
a
thing
like
a
treble
pouch
hook
which
could
be
fastened
in
a
moment
to
the
end
of
a
rope
and
thrown
into
the
window
and
would
cling
to
the
bare
wall
if
there
was
nothing
better
and
enable
him
to
go
up
and
bring
life
down
but
he
had
never
got
a
chance
to
try
it
and
contra
he
was
on
the
engine
when
they
went
tearing
over
a
woman
and
broke
her
arm
and
in
the
blackfriars
road
and
also
when
they
went
tearing
over
their
own
and
crippled
him
all
this
seemed
out
of
character
and
shocked
edward
and
then
his
mother
could
not
get
over
the
jacket
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
to
take
off
the
obnoxious
jacket
for
ever
and
was
now
lounging
at
the
station
smoking
a
short
pipe
when
a
man
galloped
up
crying
fire
all
right
said
edward
giving
a
whiff
where
lunatic
asylum
drayton
guess
how
long
before
the
horses
were
to
and
the
engine
tearing
at
a
gallop
down
the
road
and
the
firemen
shouting
fire
fire
to
clear
the
way
and
edward
voice
the
loudest
when
the
report
of
fire
swept
townward
past
dodd
she
turned
and
saw
the
glow
oh
dear
said
she
that
must
be
somewhere
near
drayton
and
full
of
the
tender
fears
that
fill
such
bosoms
as
hers
for
those
they
love
she
could
not
go
home
till
she
had
ascertained
that
it
was
not
drayton
house
moreover
edward
was
the
nearest
station
she
had
little
hope
now
of
seeing
him
to
tea
she
sighed
and
retraced
her
steps
and
made
timid
inquiries
but
could
gain
no
clear
information
presently
she
heard
galloping
behind
her
and
the
fireman
wild
sharp
cry
of
fire
an
engine
drawn
by
two
powerful
brown
horses
came
furiously
all
on
fire
itself
with
red
paint
and
polished
steel
gleaming
in
the
lights
helmeted
men
clustered
on
it
and
out
of
one
of
these
helmets
looked
a
face
like
a
fighting
lion
the
eyes
so
dilated
the
countenance
in
such
towering
excitement
the
figure
half
rising
from
his
seat
as
though
galloping
was
too
slow
and
he
wanted
to
fly
it
was
edward
mother
and
son
caught
sight
of
one
another
as
the
engine
thundered
by
and
he
gave
her
a
solemn
ardent
look
and
pointed
towards
the
fire
by
that
burning
look
and
eloquent
gesture
she
knew
it
was
something
more
than
a
common
fire
she
trembled
and
could
not
move
but
this
temporary
weakness
was
followed
by
an
influx
of
wild
vigour
she
forgot
her
years
and
flew
to
hover
round
the
fire
as
the
hen
round
water
unfortunately
she
was
too
late
to
get
any
nearer
than
the
road
outside
the
gates
the
crowd
was
so
dense
and
while
her
pale
face
and
anxious
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
wife
and
a
mother
were
bent
on
that
awful
fire
the
human
tide
flowed
swiftly
up
behind
her
and
there
she
was
wedged
in
she
was
allowed
her
foot
of
ground
to
stand
and
look
like
the
rest
no
more
mere
unit
in
that
mass
of
panting
humanity
hers
was
one
of
the
thousands
of
upturned
faces
lurid
in
the
light
of
the
now
blazing
roof
she
saw
with
thousands
the
hand
break
the
window
and
clutch
the
frame
she
gasped
with
the
crowd
at
that
terrible
and
piteous
sight
and
her
bosom
panted
for
her
in
sore
peril
but
what
is
this
the
mob
inside
utter
a
great
roar
of
hope
the
crowd
outside
strain
every
eye
a
gleaming
helmet
overtops
the
outer
wall
it
is
a
fireman
mounting
the
great
in
the
madhouse
yard
the
crowd
inside
burst
in
a
cheer
he
had
a
rope
round
his
loins
his
face
was
to
the
tree
he
mounted
and
mounted
like
a
cat
higher
and
higher
and
higher
till
he
reached
a
branch
about
twelve
feet
above
the
window
and
as
many
distant
from
it
laterally
the
crowd
cheered
him
lustily
but
dodd
half
distracted
with
terror
implored
them
not
to
encourage
him
it
is
my
child
she
cried
despairingly
my
poor
reckless
darling
come
down
edward
for
your
poor
mother
sake
come
dear
heart
said
a
woman
it
is
the
lady
son
poor
thing
stand
on
my
knee
said
a
oh
no
sir
no
i
could
not
look
at
him
for
the
world
i
can
only
pray
for
him
good
people
pray
for
us
and
she
covered
her
face
and
prayed
and
trembled
and
sobbed
hysterically
a
few
yards
behind
was
another
woman
who
had
arrived
later
yet
like
her
was
wedged
immovable
this
woman
was
more
than
dodd
and
well
she
might
for
knew
who
was
behind
that
fatal
window
the
woman
name
was
edith
archbold
the
flames
were
now
leaping
through
the
roof
and
surging
up
towards
heaven
in
waves
of
fire
six
feet
high
edward
scorched
and
half
blinded
managed
to
fasten
his
rope
to
the
bough
and
calculating
the
distances
vertical
and
lateral
he
had
to
deal
with
took
up
rope
accordingly
and
launched
himself
into
the
air
the
crowd
drew
their
breath
so
hard
it
sounded
like
a
murmur
to
their
horror
he
missed
the
window
and
went
swinging
back
there
was
a
cry
of
dismay
but
edward
had
never
hoped
to
leap
into
the
window
he
went
swinging
by
the
rope
back
to
the
main
stem
of
the
tree
gave
it
a
fierce
spang
with
his
feet
and
by
this
means
and
a
powerful
gesture
of
his
herculean
loins
got
an
inch
nearer
the
window
back
again
and
then
the
same
game
and
so
he
went
swinging
to
and
fro
over
a
wider
and
wider
space
and
by
letting
out
an
inch
of
cord
each
swing
his
flying
feet
came
above
the
then
a
little
higher
then
higher
still
and
now
oh
sight
strange
and
glorious
as
this
helmeted
hero
with
lips
clenched
and
great
eyes
that
stared
unflinchingly
at
the
surging
flames
and
gleamed
supernaturally
with
inward
and
outward
fire
swang
to
and
fro
on
his
frail
support
still
making
for
the
window
the
heads
of
all
the
hoping
fearing
admiring
panting
crowd
went
surging
and
waving
to
and
fro
beneath
so
did
not
their
hearts
only
but
their
agitated
bodies
follow
the
course
of
his
body
as
it
rushed
to
and
fro
faster
and
faster
through
the
hot
air
starred
with
and
hail
of
fire
and
those
his
for
whom
the
brave
fireman
made
this
supernatural
effort
did
they
know
their
desperate
condition
were
they
still
alive
one
little
hour
ago
alfred
sat
on
the
bed
full
of
hope
every
minute
he
expected
to
hear
the
robin
put
a
key
into
the
door
he
was
all
ready
and
his
money
in
his
pocket
alas
his
liberator
came
not
some
screw
loose
again
presently
he
was
conscious
of
a
great
commotion
in
the
house
feet
ran
up
and
down
then
came
a
smell
of
burning
the
outside
was
illuminated
he
was
glad
at
first
he
had
a
spite
against
the
place
but
soon
he
became
alarmed
and
hammered
at
the
door
and
tried
to
force
it
impossible
fire
rang
from
voices
fire
crackled
above
his
head
he
ran
about
the
room
like
a
wild
creature
he
sprang
up
at
the
window
and
dashed
his
hand
through
but
fell
back
he
sprang
again
and
got
his
hand
on
some
of
the
lighter
woodwork
he
drew
himself
up
nearly
to
the
window
and
then
the
wood
gave
way
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
striking
the
back
of
his
head
nearly
stunned
himself
the
flames
roared
fearfully
now
and
at
this
david
who
had
hitherto
sat
unconcerned
started
up
and
in
a
stentorian
voice
issued
order
upon
order
to
furl
every
rag
of
sail
and
bring
the
ship
to
the
wind
he
thought
it
was
a
tempest
oh
hush
hush
cried
alfred
in
a
beam
fell
from
the
roof
to
the
floor
precursor
of
the
rest
on
this
david
thought
the
ship
was
ashore
and
shouted
a
fresh
set
of
orders
proper
to
the
occasion
so
terribly
alike
are
the
angry
voices
of
the
but
alfred
implored
him
and
got
him
to
kneel
down
with
him
and
held
his
hand
and
prayed
and
even
while
they
kneeled
and
alfred
prayed
death
and
life
met
and
fought
for
them
under
the
door
tight
as
it
was
and
through
the
keyhole
struggled
a
hot
stifling
smoke
merciful
destroyer
running
before
fire
and
the
shadow
of
a
gigantic
figure
began
to
flicker
in
from
the
outside
and
to
come
and
go
upon
the
wall
alfred
did
not
know
what
that
was
but
it
gave
him
a
vague
hope
he
prayed
aloud
as
men
pray
only
for
their
bodies
the
crowd
heard
him
and
hushed
itself
breathless
the
smoke
penetrated
faster
blinding
and
stifling
the
giant
shadow
came
and
went
but
now
the
greater
part
of
the
roof
fell
in
with
an
awful
report
the
blazing
timbers
thundered
down
to
the
basement
with
endless
clatter
of
tiles
the
walls
quivered
and
the
building
belched
skyward
a
thousand
jets
of
fire
like
a
bouquet
of
rockets
and
then
a
cloud
of
smoke
alfred
gave
up
all
hope
and
prepared
to
die
crash
as
if
discharged
from
a
cannon
came
bursting
through
the
window
with
the
roar
of
an
applauding
multitude
and
a
mother
unheeded
scream
a
helmeted
figure
rope
in
hand
and
alighted
erect
and
commanding
on
the
floor
amidst
a
shower
of
splinters
and
tinkling
glass
up
men
for
your
lives
roared
this
clutching
them
hard
and
dragged
them
both
up
to
their
feet
by
one
prodigious
gesture
all
three
faces
came
together
and
shone
in
the
lurid
light
and
he
knew
his
father
and
the
wretch
and
the
wretch
knew
him
oh
ah
passed
like
pistol
shots
but
not
a
word
even
this
strange
meeting
went
for
little
so
awful
was
the
moment
so
great
are
death
and
fire
edward
clawed
his
rope
to
the
bed
up
to
the
window
by
it
dropped
his
line
to
fireman
jackson
planted
express
below
and
in
another
moment
was
hauling
up
a
rope
ladder
this
he
attached
and
getting
on
it
and
holding
his
own
rope
by
way
of
banister
cried
now
men
quick
for
your
but
poor
david
called
that
deserting
the
ship
and
demurred
till
alfred
assured
him
the
captain
had
ordered
it
he
then
submitted
directly
touched
his
forelock
to
edward
whom
he
took
for
that
officer
and
went
down
the
ladder
alfred
followed
now
the
moment
those
two
figures
emerged
from
the
burning
pile
dodd
already
half
dead
with
terror
for
her
son
saw
and
knew
her
husband
for
all
about
him
it
was
as
light
as
day
what
terror
what
joy
what
gratitude
what
pride
what
a
tempest
of
emotions
but
her
fears
were
not
ended
edward
not
to
overweight
the
ladder
went
dangling
by
his
hands
along
the
rope
towards
the
tree
and
his
eyes
stared
fearfully
from
him
to
the
other
and
her
heart
hung
trembling
on
her
husband
descending
cautiously
and
then
on
his
preserver
her
son
who
was
dangling
along
by
the
hands
on
that
frail
support
the
mob
cheered
him
royally
but
she
screamed
and
hid
her
face
again
at
last
both
her
darlings
were
safe
and
then
the
lusty
cheers
made
her
thrill
with
pride
and
joy
till
all
of
a
sudden
they
seemed
to
die
away
and
the
terrible
fire
to
go
out
and
the
wife
and
mother
drooped
her
head
and
swooned
away
wedged
in
and
kept
from
falling
by
the
crowd
inside
the
mob
parted
and
made
two
rushes
one
at
the
rescued
men
one
at
the
gallant
fireman
alfred
and
david
were
overpowered
with
curiosity
and
sympathy
they
had
to
shake
a
hundred
honest
hands
and
others
still
pressing
on
hurried
them
nearly
off
their
feet
gently
good
friends
do
part
us
said
alfred
he
is
the
keeper
said
one
of
the
crowd
yes
i
his
keeper
and
i
want
to
get
him
quietly
away
this
excitement
will
do
him
harm
else
good
friends
help
me
out
by
that
all
right
was
the
cry
and
they
rushed
with
him
to
the
back
door
rooke
who
was
about
twenty
yards
off
saw
and
suspected
this
movement
he
fought
his
way
and
struggled
after
alfred
in
silence
presently
to
his
surprise
alfred
unlocked
the
door
and
whipped
out
with
david
leaving
the
door
open
rooke
shouted
and
halloaed
stop
him
he
is
escaping
and
struggled
madly
to
the
door
now
another
crowd
had
been
waiting
in
the
meadows
seeing
the
door
open
they
rushed
in
and
the
doorway
was
jammed
directly
in
the
confusion
alfred
drew
david
along
the
side
of
the
wall
told
him
to
stay
quiet
bolted
behind
an
outhouse
and
then
ran
across
country
for
the
bare
life
to
his
horror
david
followed
him
and
with
a
madman
agility
soon
caught
him
he
snorted
like
a
spirited
horse
and
shouted
cheerily
go
ahead
messmate
i
smell
blue
come
on
then
cried
alfred
half
mad
himself
with
excitement
and
the
pair
ran
furiously
and
dashed
through
hedges
and
ditches
torn
bleeding
splashed
triumphant
behind
them
the
burning
madhouse
above
them
the
spangled
sky
the
fresh
free
air
of
liberty
blowing
in
their
nostrils
and
rushing
past
their
ears
alfred
chest
expanded
he
laughed
for
joy
he
sang
for
joy
he
leaped
as
he
went
nor
did
he
care
where
he
went
david
took
the
command
and
kept
snuffing
the
air
and
shaping
his
course
for
blue
water
and
so
they
rushed
along
the
livelong
night
free
chapter
xliv
a
report
came
round
that
the
asylum
was
open
in
the
rear
a
rush
was
made
thither
from
the
front
and
this
thinned
the
crowd
considerably
so
then
dodd
was
got
out
by
the
help
of
some
humane
persons
and
carried
into
the
nearest
house
more
dead
than
alive
there
she
found
archbold
in
a
pitiable
state
that
lady
had
been
looking
on
the
fire
with
the
key
in
her
pocket
by
taking
which
she
was
like
to
be
a
murderess
her
terror
and
remorse
were
distracting
and
the
revulsion
had
thrown
her
into
violent
hysterics
dodd
plucked
up
a
little
strength
and
characteristically
enough
tottered
to
her
assistance
and
called
for
the
best
remedies
and
then
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
and
whispered
soothingly
that
both
were
now
safe
meaning
david
and
edward
archbold
thought
she
meant
alfred
and
david
this
new
shock
was
as
good
for
her
as
cold
water
she
became
quieter
and
presently
gulped
out
you
saw
them
you
knew
them
ump
all
that
way
off
knew
them
said
dodd
why
one
was
my
husband
and
the
other
my
archbold
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
yes
madam
continued
dodd
the
young
fireman
who
went
and
saved
my
husband
was
my
own
son
my
edward
my
hero
oh
i
am
a
happy
wife
a
proud
she
could
say
no
more
for
tears
of
joy
and
while
she
wept
deliciously
archbold
cried
too
and
so
invigorated
and
refreshed
her
cunning
and
presently
she
perked
up
and
told
dodd
boldly
that
edward
had
been
seeking
her
and
was
gone
home
she
had
better
follow
him
or
he
would
be
anxious
but
my
poor
husband
objected
dodd
he
is
safe
said
the
other
i
saw
him
ump
with
an
ah
said
dodd
with
meaning
that
other
my
son
rescued
was
an
attendant
was
he
ump
she
then
promised
to
take
david
under
her
especial
care
and
dodd
consented
though
reluctantly
to
go
home
to
her
surprise
edward
had
not
yet
arrived
and
julia
was
sitting
up
very
anxious
and
flew
at
her
with
a
gurgle
and
kissed
her
eagerly
and
then
drawing
back
her
head
searched
the
maternal
eyes
for
what
was
the
matter
ah
you
may
well
look
said
dodd
oh
my
child
what
a
night
this
has
been
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
held
up
her
arms
julia
settled
down
in
them
directly
and
in
that
position
dodd
told
all
the
night
work
told
it
under
a
running
accompaniment
of
sighs
and
kisses
and
ejaculations
and
dear
mammas
and
poor
mammas
and
bursts
of
sympathy
astonishment
pity
and
wonder
thus
embellished
and
interrupted
the
strange
tale
was
hardly
ended
when
a
manly
step
came
up
the
stairs
and
both
ladies
pinched
each
other
and
were
still
as
mice
and
in
walked
a
fireman
with
a
wet
livery
and
a
face
smirched
with
smoke
julia
flew
at
him
with
a
gurgle
of
the
first
degree
and
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
both
his
blackened
cheeks
again
and
again
crying
oh
my
own
my
precious
my
sweet
brave
darling
kiss
me
kiss
me
kiss
me
you
are
a
hero
a
christian
hero
that
saves
life
not
takes
it
dodd
checked
her
impetuous
career
by
asking
piteously
if
his
mother
was
not
to
have
him
on
this
julia
drew
him
along
by
the
hand
and
sank
with
him
at
dodd
knees
and
she
held
him
at
arm
length
and
gazed
at
him
and
then
drew
him
close
and
enfolded
him
and
thanked
god
for
him
and
then
they
both
embraced
him
at
once
and
interwove
him
heaven
knows
how
and
poured
the
wealth
of
their
womanly
hearts
out
on
him
in
a
torrent
and
nearly
made
him
snivel
but
presently
something
in
his
face
struck
dodd
accustomed
to
read
her
children
is
there
anything
the
matter
love
she
inquired
anxiously
he
looked
down
and
said
i
am
dead
sleepy
mamma
for
one
of
course
he
is
poor
child
said
julia
doing
the
submaternal
wait
till
i
see
everything
is
comfortable
and
she
flew
off
turned
suddenly
at
the
door
with
oh
you
darling
and
up
to
his
bedroom
and
put
more
coals
on
his
fire
and
took
a
swift
housewifely
look
all
round
dodd
seized
the
opportunity
edward
there
is
something
and
no
mistake
said
he
drily
but
i
thought
if
i
told
you
before
her
you
might
scold
scold
you
love
never
hush
i
come
to
your
room
soon
after
this
they
all
bade
each
other
good
night
and
presently
dodd
came
and
tapped
softly
at
her
son
door
and
found
him
with
his
vest
and
coat
off
and
his
helmet
standing
on
the
table
reflecting
a
red
coal
he
was
seated
by
the
fire
in
a
brown
study
smoking
he
apologised
and
offered
to
throw
the
weed
away
no
no
said
she
suppressing
a
cough
not
if
it
does
you
well
mother
when
you
are
in
a
fix
smoke
is
a
soother
you
know
and
i
in
a
regular
a
fix
sighed
dodd
resignedly
and
waited
patiently
all
ears
mamma
said
the
becoming
speculative
under
the
dreamy
influence
of
the
weed
i
wonder
whether
such
a
muddle
ever
was
before
when
a
man
is
fighting
with
fire
what
with
the
heat
and
what
with
the
excitement
his
pulse
is
at
a
hundred
and
sixty
and
his
brain
all
in
a
whirl
and
he
scarce
knows
what
he
is
doing
till
after
it
is
done
but
i
been
thinking
of
it
all
since
puff
there
was
my
poor
little
mamma
in
the
mob
i
double
myself
up
for
my
spring
and
i
go
at
the
window
and
through
it
now
on
this
side
of
it
i
hear
my
mother
cry
come
down
on
the
other
side
i
fall
on
two
men
perishing
in
an
oven
one
is
my
own
father
and
the
other
is
who
do
you
think
wretch
dodd
held
up
her
hands
in
mute
amazement
i
had
promised
to
break
every
bone
in
his
skin
at
our
first
meeting
and
i
kept
my
promise
by
saving
his
skin
and
bones
and
life
and
puff
dodd
groaned
aloud
i
thought
it
was
he
she
said
faintly
that
tall
figure
that
haughty
grace
but
archbold
told
me
positively
it
was
an
then
she
told
you
a
cracker
it
was
not
an
attendant
but
a
madman
and
that
madman
was
alfred
hardie
upon
my
soul
our
julia
missing
he
smoked
on
in
profound
silence
waiting
for
her
to
speak
but
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
mute
and
all
relaxed
as
if
the
news
had
knocked
her
down
come
now
said
edward
at
last
what
is
to
be
done
may
i
tell
julia
that
is
the
not
for
the
world
said
dodd
shocked
into
energy
would
you
blight
her
young
life
for
ever
as
mine
is
blighted
she
then
assured
him
that
if
alfred
sad
state
came
to
julia
ears
all
her
love
for
him
would
revive
and
she
would
break
with
hurd
and
indeed
never
marry
all
her
life
i
see
no
end
to
her
misery
continued
dodd
with
a
deep
sigh
for
she
is
full
of
courage
she
would
not
shrink
from
a
madhouse
why
she
visits
every
day
she
would
be
always
going
to
see
her
alfred
and
so
nurse
her
pity
and
her
unhappy
love
no
no
let
be
a
widow
with
a
living
husband
if
it
is
god
will
i
have
had
my
happy
days
but
my
child
she
shall
not
be
so
withered
in
the
flower
of
her
days
for
any
man
that
ever
breathed
she
shall
not
i
the
mother
could
utter
no
more
for
emotion
well
said
edward
you
know
best
i
generally
make
a
mess
of
it
when
i
disobey
you
but
concealments
are
bad
things
too
we
used
to
go
with
our
bosoms
open
ah
puff
edward
said
dodd
after
some
consideration
the
best
thing
is
to
marry
her
to
hurd
at
once
he
has
spoken
to
me
for
her
and
i
sounded
has
he
well
and
what
did
she
say
she
said
she
would
rather
not
marry
at
all
but
live
and
die
with
me
then
i
pressed
her
a
little
you
know
then
she
did
say
she
could
never
marry
any
but
a
clergyman
now
she
had
lost
her
poor
alfred
and
then
i
told
her
i
thought
hurd
could
make
her
happy
and
she
would
make
me
happy
if
she
could
esteem
him
and
marry
well
mamma
and
what
then
why
then
my
poor
child
gave
me
a
look
that
haunts
me
still
a
look
of
unutterable
love
and
reproach
and
resignation
and
despair
and
burst
out
crying
so
piteously
i
could
say
no
more
oh
oh
oh
oh
do
you
cry
mammy
dear
said
edward
ah
i
remember
when
a
tear
was
a
wonder
in
our
and
the
sucked
at
his
cigar
to
stop
a
sigh
and
n
now
n
ot
a
d
day
without
them
sighed
dodd
but
have
cost
me
none
my
precious
i
waiting
my
time
puff
mamma
take
my
advice
do
you
fidget
so
let
things
alone
why
hurry
her
into
marrying
hurd
or
anybody
look
here
i
keep
dark
to
please
you
if
you
keep
quiet
to
please
at
breakfast
time
came
a
messenger
with
a
line
from
archbold
to
say
that
david
had
escaped
from
drayton
house
in
company
with
another
dangerous
maniac
dodd
received
the
blow
with
a
kind
of
desperate
resignation
she
rose
quietly
from
the
table
without
a
word
and
went
to
put
on
her
bonnet
leaving
her
breakfast
and
the
note
for
she
did
not
at
once
see
all
that
was
implied
in
the
communication
she
took
edward
with
her
to
drayton
house
the
firemen
had
saved
one
half
of
that
building
the
rest
was
a
black
shell
archbold
came
to
them
looking
haggard
and
told
them
two
keepers
were
already
scouring
the
country
and
an
advertisement
sent
to
all
the
journals
oh
madam
said
dodd
if
the
other
should
hurt
him
or
lead
him
somewhere
to
his
death
archbold
said
she
might
dismiss
this
fear
the
patient
in
question
had
but
one
illusion
and
though
terribly
dangerous
when
thwarted
in
that
was
most
intelligent
in
a
general
way
and
much
attached
to
dodd
they
were
always
together
a
strange
expression
shot
into
dodd
eye
she
pinched
edward
arm
to
keep
him
quiet
and
said
with
feigned
indifference
then
it
was
the
one
who
was
in
such
danger
with
my
husband
last
night
yes
said
archbold
off
her
guard
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
this
handsome
young
gentleman
was
the
fireman
of
last
night
she
saw
her
mistake
though
the
moment
he
said
bluntly
why
you
told
my
mother
it
was
an
did
i
madam
asked
archbold
mighty
innocently
i
suppose
i
thought
so
well
i
was
mistaken
dodd
was
silent
a
moment
then
somewhat
hastily
bade
archbold
she
told
the
cabman
to
drive
to
an
old
acquaintance
of
ours
green
he
had
set
up
detective
on
his
own
account
he
was
not
at
his
office
but
expected
she
sat
patiently
down
till
he
came
in
they
put
their
heads
together
and
green
dashed
down
to
the
asylum
with
a
myrmidon
while
dodd
went
into
the
city
to
obtain
leave
of
absence
from
cross
and
co
this
was
politely
declined
at
first
but
on
dodd
showing
symptoms
of
leaving
them
altogether
it
was
conceded
she
returned
home
with
edward
and
there
was
green
he
had
actually
traced
the
fugitives
by
broken
fences
and
occasional
footsteps
in
the
side
clay
of
ditches
so
far
as
to
leave
no
doubt
they
had
got
upon
the
great
road
then
dodd
had
a
female
inspiration
the
dover
road
ah
my
husband
will
make
for
the
i
should
wonder
being
a
sailor
said
green
it
is
a
pleasure
to
work
with
a
lady
like
you
that
puts
in
a
good
hint
know
anything
about
the
other
one
dodd
almost
started
at
this
question
but
it
was
a
natural
one
for
green
to
ask
she
said
gravely
i
do
to
my
green
eye
sparkled
and
he
took
out
his
now
where
is
like
to
make
for
dodd
seemed
to
wince
at
the
question
and
then
turned
her
eyes
inward
to
divine
the
result
was
she
gave
a
downright
shudder
and
said
evasively
being
with
david
i
hope
and
pray
he
will
go
towards
the
no
no
said
green
it
wo
do
to
count
on
that
altogether
how
do
we
know
which
of
the
two
will
lead
the
other
you
must
please
to
put
dodd
out
of
the
question
for
a
moment
now
we
say
no
had
escaped
alone
where
would
he
be
like
to
run
to
dodd
thus
pressed
turned
her
eyes
more
and
more
inward
and
said
at
last
in
a
very
low
voice
and
with
a
sort
of
concentrated
horror
he
will
come
to
my
green
booked
this
eagerly
the
lady
emotion
was
nothing
to
him
the
hint
was
invaluable
the
combination
interesting
well
said
he
i
plant
a
good
man
in
sight
of
your
door
and
i
take
the
dover
road
directly
with
my
drag
my
teeth
were
strong
enough
for
the
last
nut
you
gave
me
to
crack
let
us
try
this
one
tom
green
often
beat
twice
i
will
go
with
you
honoured
and
proud
but
a
lady
like
you
in
my
along
me
and
my
mate
dodd
waived
this
objection
almost
contemptuously
she
was
all
wife
now
it
was
agreed
that
green
should
drive
round
for
her
in
an
hour
he
departed
for
the
present
and
edward
proposed
to
go
in
the
too
but
she
told
him
no
she
wanted
him
at
home
to
guard
his
sister
against
the
then
seeing
him
look
puzzled
consider
edward
said
she
he
is
not
like
your
poor
father
he
has
not
forgotten
that
advertisement
aileen
aroon
it
was
from
him
you
know
and
then
why
does
he
attach
himself
so
to
poor
papa
do
you
not
see
it
is
because
he
is
julia
father
wretch
loves
her
edward
from
puzzled
looked
very
grave
what
a
head
you
have
got
mamma
he
said
i
should
never
have
seen
all
this
yet
it
plain
enough
now
as
you
put
yes
it
is
plain
our
darling
is
betrothed
to
a
maniac
that
maniac
loves
her
and
much
i
fear
she
loves
him
some
new
calamity
is
impending
oh
my
son
i
feel
it
already
heavy
on
my
heart
what
is
it
to
be
is
your
father
to
be
led
to
destruction
or
will
that
furious
wretch
burst
in
upon
your
sister
and
kill
her
or
perhaps
kill
hard
if
he
catches
them
together
what
may
not
happen
now
the
very
air
seems
to
me
swarming
with
oh
i
take
care
of
all
that
said
edward
and
he
comforted
her
a
little
by
promising
faithfully
not
to
let
julia
go
out
of
his
sight
till
her
return
she
put
on
a
plain
the
came
she
slipped
fifty
sovereigns
into
green
hands
for
expenses
and
off
they
went
at
a
slapping
pace
the
horse
was
a
great
bony
hunter
of
rare
speed
and
endurance
and
his
long
stride
and
powerful
action
raised
poor
dodd
hopes
and
the
rushing
air
did
her
good
green
to
her
surprise
made
few
inquiries
for
some
miles
on
the
dover
road
but
he
explained
to
her
that
the
parties
they
were
after
had
probably
walked
all
night
they
do
tire
that
sort
said
green
at
dartford
they
got
a
doubtful
intimation
on
the
strength
of
which
he
rattled
on
to
rochester
there
he
pulled
up
deposited
dodd
at
the
principal
inn
till
morning
and
scoured
the
town
for
intelligence
he
inquired
of
all
the
policemen
described
his
men
and
shrewdly
added
out
of
his
intelligence
both
splashed
and
no
the
bobbies
had
not
seen
them
then
he
walked
out
to
the
side
of
the
town
nearest
london
and
examined
all
the
dealers
in
food
at
last
he
found
a
baker
who
early
that
morning
had
sold
a
quartern
loaf
to
two
tall
men
without
hats
and
splashed
fearful
he
added
thought
they
had
broken
prison
but
was
no
business
of
mine
they
paid
for
the
bread
right
on
hearing
they
had
entered
rochester
hatless
the
shrewd
green
made
direct
to
the
very
nearest
and
his
sagacity
was
rewarded
the
shopkeeper
was
a
chatterbox
and
told
him
yes
two
gents
out
on
a
frolic
had
bought
a
couple
of
hats
of
him
and
a
whole
set
of
sailor
clothes
i
think
they
were
respectable
too
but
nothing
else
would
satisfy
him
so
the
young
one
he
humoured
him
and
bought
them
i
took
his
old
ones
in
at
that
green
offered
a
sovereign
for
the
old
clothes
blindfold
the
trader
instantly
asked
two
pounds
and
took
thirty
shillings
green
now
set
the
police
to
scour
the
town
for
a
gentleman
and
a
common
sailor
in
company
offered
a
handsome
reward
and
went
to
bed
in
a
small
inn
with
david
clothes
by
the
kitchen
fire
early
in
the
morning
he
went
to
dodd
hotel
with
david
clothes
nicely
dried
and
told
her
his
tale
she
knew
the
clothes
directly
kissed
them
and
cried
over
them
then
gave
him
her
hand
with
a
world
of
dignity
and
grace
what
an
able
man
sir
you
inspire
me
with
great
and
you
me
with
zeal
said
the
delighted
green
why
i
go
through
fire
and
water
for
a
lady
like
you
that
pays
well
and
grudge
a
fellow
a
bit
of
praise
now
you
must
eat
a
bit
if
ever
so
little
and
then
we
take
the
road
for
the
police
think
the
parties
have
left
the
town
and
by
their
night
work
they
must
be
good
the
took
the
road
and
the
stepped
out
thirteen
miles
an
hour
now
at
this
moment
alfred
and
david
were
bowling
along
ahead
with
a
perfect
sense
of
security
all
that
first
night
the
grandest
of
his
life
alfred
walked
on
air
and
drank
the
glorious
exhilarating
breath
of
freedom
but
when
the
sun
dawned
on
them
his
intoxicating
joy
began
to
be
dashed
with
apprehension
hatless
and
bemired
might
they
not
be
suspected
and
detained
by
some
officious
authority
but
the
set
that
all
right
he
took
a
room
in
the
bear
locked
the
door
put
the
key
under
his
pillow
and
slept
till
eleven
at
noon
they
were
on
the
road
again
and
as
they
swung
lustily
along
in
the
frosty
but
kindly
air
alfred
chest
expanded
his
spirits
rose
and
he
felt
a
man
all
over
exhilarated
by
freedom
youth
and
motion
and
a
little
inflated
by
reviving
vanity
his
heart
buoyant
as
his
foot
now
began
to
nurse
aspiring
projects
he
would
indict
his
own
father
and
the
doctors
and
immolate
them
on
the
altar
of
justice
and
publicly
wipe
off
the
stigma
they
had
cast
on
him
and
meantime
he
would
cure
david
and
restore
him
to
his
family
he
loved
this
harmless
companion
of
his
cell
his
danger
and
his
flight
loved
him
for
julia
sake
loved
him
for
his
own
youth
and
vanity
whispered
i
know
more
about
madness
than
the
doctors
i
have
seen
it
it
struck
him
david
longing
for
blue
water
was
one
of
those
unerring
instincts
that
sometimes
guide
the
sick
to
their
cure
and
then
as
the
law
permits
the
forcible
recapture
of
a
patient
without
a
fresh
order
or
certificates
within
fourteen
days
of
his
escape
from
an
asylum
he
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
show
himself
in
london
till
that
time
should
have
elapsed
so
all
things
considered
why
not
hide
a
few
days
with
david
in
some
insignificant
seaport
and
revel
in
liberty
and
blue
water
with
him
all
day
long
and
so
by
associations
touch
the
spring
of
memory
and
begin
the
cure
as
for
david
he
seemed
driven
seaward
by
some
unseen
spur
he
fidgeted
at
all
delay
even
dinner
fretted
him
he
panted
so
for
his
natural
element
alfred
humoured
him
and
an
hour
after
sunset
they
reached
the
town
of
canterbury
here
alfred
took
the
same
precautions
as
before
and
slept
till
nine
when
he
awoke
he
found
david
walking
to
and
fro
impatiently
all
right
messmate
said
alfred
we
shall
soon
be
in
blue
he
made
all
haste
and
they
were
on
the
road
again
by
ten
walking
at
a
gallant
pace
but
the
was
already
rattling
along
about
thirty
miles
behind
them
green
inquired
at
all
the
turnpikes
and
vehicles
the
scent
was
cold
at
first
but
warmer
by
degrees
and
hot
at
canterbury
green
just
baited
his
gallant
horse
and
came
foaming
on
and
just
as
the
pair
entered
the
town
of
folkestone
their
pursuers
came
up
to
the
not
five
miles
behind
them
alfred
went
to
a
good
inn
in
folkestone
and
ordered
a
steak
then
strolled
with
david
by
the
beach
and
gloried
in
the
water
with
him
after
dinner
we
will
take
a
boat
and
have
a
sail
said
he
see
there
a
nice
boat
riding
at
anchor
david
snuffed
the
breeze
and
his
eye
sparkled
and
he
said
wind
due
east
and
this
remark
slight
as
it
was
was
practical
and
gave
alfred
great
delight
strengthened
his
growing
conviction
that
not
for
nothing
had
this
charge
been
thrown
on
him
he
should
be
the
one
to
cure
his
own
father
for
julia
father
was
his
he
had
no
father
now
all
right
said
he
gaily
we
soon
be
on
blue
water
but
first
we
have
our
dinner
old
boy
for
i
am
david
said
nothing
and
went
rather
doggedly
back
to
the
inn
with
him
the
steak
was
on
the
table
alfred
told
the
waiter
to
uncover
and
david
to
fall
to
while
he
just
ran
upstairs
to
wash
his
hands
he
came
down
in
less
than
two
minutes
but
david
was
gone
and
the
waiter
standing
there
erect
and
apathetic
like
a
wooden
sentinel
why
where
is
he
said
alfred
gent
gone
out
was
the
reply
and
you
stood
there
and
let
him
you
born
idiot
which
way
is
he
gone
i
do
know
said
the
waiter
angrily
i
ai
a
none
but
respectable
gents
comes
here
as
do
want
alfred
darted
out
and
scoured
the
town
he
asked
everybody
if
they
had
seen
a
tall
gentleman
dressed
like
a
common
sailor
nobody
could
tell
him
there
were
so
many
sailors
about
the
port
that
which
in
an
inland
town
would
have
betrayed
the
truant
concealed
him
here
a
cold
perspiration
began
to
gather
on
alfred
brow
as
he
ran
wildly
all
over
the
place
he
could
not
find
him
nor
any
trace
of
him
at
last
it
struck
him
that
he
had
originally
proposed
to
go
to
dover
and
had
spoken
of
that
town
to
david
though
he
had
now
glanced
aside
making
for
the
smaller
ports
on
the
south
coast
he
hired
a
horse
directly
and
galloped
furiously
to
dover
he
rode
down
to
the
pier
gave
his
horse
to
a
boy
to
hold
and
ran
about
inquiring
far
david
he
could
not
find
him
but
at
last
he
found
a
policeman
who
told
him
he
thought
there
was
another
party
on
the
same
lay
as
himself
no
said
the
man
correcting
himself
it
was
two
they
were
after
a
gentleman
and
a
sailor
perhaps
you
are
his
alfred
blood
ran
cold
pursued
and
so
hotly
no
no
he
stammered
i
suspect
i
am
on
the
same
then
he
said
cunningly
for
asylums
teach
the
frankest
natures
cunning
come
and
have
a
glass
of
grog
and
tell
me
all
about
bobby
consented
and
under
its
influence
described
dodd
and
her
companions
to
him
but
not
everybody
can
describe
minutely
in
the
bare
outlines
which
were
all
this
artist
could
furnish
him
alfred
recognised
at
once
whom
do
you
think
archbold
wolf
and
his
arch
enemy
rooke
the
keeper
doubtless
his
own
mind
seizing
on
so
vague
a
description
adapted
it
rather
hastily
to
what
seemed
probable
dodd
never
occurred
to
him
nor
that
david
was
the
sole
or
even
the
main
object
of
the
pursuit
he
was
thoroughly
puzzled
what
to
do
however
as
his
pursuers
had
clearly
scoured
dover
and
would
have
found
david
if
there
he
made
use
of
their
labours
and
galloped
back
towards
folkestone
but
he
took
the
precaution
to
inquire
at
the
first
turnpike
and
there
he
learned
a
lady
and
two
men
had
passed
through
about
an
hour
before
in
a
it
was
a
wonder
he
had
missed
them
alfred
gnashed
his
teeth
curse
you
he
muttered
well
do
my
work
in
folkestone
i
find
him
yet
and
baffle
he
turned
his
horse
head
westward
and
rode
after
david
convinced
that
his
lost
friend
would
not
go
inland
he
took
care
to
keep
near
the
cliffs
and
had
ever
an
eye
on
the
beach
when
the
road
came
near
enough
about
eight
miles
west
of
folkestone
he
saw
a
going
down
a
hill
before
him
but
there
was
only
a
single
person
in
it
however
he
increased
his
pace
and
got
close
behind
it
as
it
mounted
the
succeeding
hill
which
was
a
high
one
walking
leisurely
behind
it
his
quick
eye
caught
sight
of
a
lady
veil
wrapped
round
the
iron
of
the
seat
that
made
him
instantly
suspect
this
might
be
the
after
all
but
if
so
how
came
a
stranger
in
it
he
despised
a
single
foe
and
resolved
to
pump
this
one
and
learn
where
the
others
were
while
he
was
thinking
how
he
should
begin
the
stopped
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
the
driver
looked
seaward
at
some
object
that
appeared
to
interest
him
it
was
a
glorious
scene
viewed
from
so
great
a
height
the
sea
expanded
like
ocean
and
its
waters
sparkled
and
laughed
innumerable
in
the
breeze
a
beautiful
sight
sir
said
the
escaped
prisoner
you
may
well
stop
to
look
at
the
man
touched
his
hat
and
chuckled
i
do
think
you
know
what
i
am
looking
at
sir
he
said
politely
i
thought
it
was
the
lovely
sea
view
so
bright
so
broad
so
no
sir
not
but
what
i
can
enjoy
that
a
bit
too
but
what
i
looking
at
is
an
do
you
see
that
little
boat
sailing
right
down
the
coast
about
eight
miles
off
well
sir
what
do
you
think
there
is
in
that
boat
but
you
never
guess
a
ah
curious
sir
is
it
a
respectable
gentleman
too
he
is
and
sails
well
only
stark
staring
mad
there
was
two
of
in
company
but
it
seems
they
ca
keep
together
long
one
steals
a
boat
and
there
he
goes
down
channel
and
now
look
here
sir
see
this
smoking
along
right
in
front
of
us
she
after
him
and
see
there
my
governor
aboard
standing
by
the
wheel
with
a
bobby
and
a
lady
and
if
ever
there
was
a
lady
she
one
here
he
lowered
his
voice
she
that
mad
gentleman
wife
sir
as
i
am
a
living
they
both
looked
down
on
the
strange
chase
in
silence
will
they
catch
her
asked
alfred
at
last
under
his
breath
how
can
we
be
off
it
steam
against
sails
and
if
he
runs
ashore
i
shall
be
there
to
nab
alfred
looked
and
looked
the
water
came
into
his
eyes
it
the
best
thing
that
can
befall
him
now
he
murmured
he
gave
the
man
and
then
turned
his
horse
head
and
walked
him
down
the
hill
towards
folkestone
on
his
arrival
there
he
paid
for
his
horse
and
his
untasted
dinner
and
took
the
first
train
to
london
a
little
dispirited
and
a
good
deal
mortified
for
he
hated
to
be
beat
but
david
was
in
good
hands
that
was
one
comfort
and
he
had
glorious
work
on
hand
love
and
justice
he
went
to
an
out
of
the
way
inn
in
the
suburbs
and
when
he
had
bought
a
and
some
linen
and
other
necessaries
he
had
but
one
sovereign
left
his
heart
urged
him
vehemently
to
go
at
once
and
find
his
julia
but
alas
he
did
not
even
know
where
she
lived
and
he
dared
not
at
present
make
public
inquiries
that
would
draw
attention
to
himself
and
be
his
destruction
for
wolf
stood
well
with
the
police
and
nearly
always
recaptured
his
truant
patients
by
their
aid
before
the
fourteen
days
had
elapsed
he
determined
to
go
first
to
a
solicitor
and
launch
him
against
his
enemies
while
compelled
to
shirk
them
in
his
own
person
curious
position
now
amongst
his
father
creditors
was
compton
a
solicitor
known
for
an
eccentric
but
honourable
man
and
for
success
in
litigation
compton
used
to
do
his
own
business
in
barkington
and
employ
an
agent
in
london
but
alfred
remembered
to
have
heard
just
before
his
incarceration
that
he
had
reversed
the
parts
and
now
lived
in
london
alfred
found
him
out
by
the
directory
and
called
at
his
chambers
in
lincoln
inn
fields
he
had
to
wait
some
time
in
the
outer
office
listening
to
a
fluent
earnest
client
preaching
within
but
presently
a
sharp
voice
broke
in
upon
the
drone
and
after
a
few
sentences
compton
ushered
out
a
client
with
these
remarkable
words
and
as
for
your
invention
it
has
been
invented
four
times
before
you
invented
it
and
never
was
worth
inventing
at
all
and
you
have
borrowed
two
hundred
pounds
of
me
in
ninety
loans
each
of
which
cost
me
an
hour
invaluable
time
i
hold
ninety
acknowledgments
in
your
handwriting
and
i
put
them
all
in
force
for
my
protection
with
this
he
turned
to
his
head
clerk
mr
colls
take
out
a
writ
against
this
client
what
is
your
christian
name
sir
i
simon
said
the
gaping
client
off
his
guard
thank
you
sir
said
compton
with
sudden
politeness
then
resuming
hostilities
a
writ
in
the
common
pleas
against
simon
macfarlane
keep
it
in
your
drawer
colls
and
if
ever
the
said
macfarlane
does
me
the
honour
to
call
on
me
again
serve
him
with
it
on
the
spot
and
if
not
not
good
morning
and
with
this
he
bolted
into
his
own
room
and
slammed
its
door
clerks
opened
the
outer
door
to
macfarlane
with
significant
grins
and
he
went
out
bewildered
sorely
yea
even
like
one
that
walketh
abroad
in
his
sleep
now
sir
said
colls
cheerfully
to
alfred
but
the
new
client
naturally
hesitated
now
he
put
on
his
most
fascinating
smile
and
said
well
colls
what
do
you
advise
is
this
a
moment
to
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
at
alfred
smile
and
address
colls
fell
in
love
with
him
directly
and
assured
him
voce
and
with
friendly
familiarity
that
now
was
his
time
why
he
be
as
sweet
as
honey
now
he
has
got
rid
of
a
with
this
he
took
alfred
name
and
ushered
him
into
a
room
piled
with
japanned
tin
boxes
where
compton
sat
looking
all
complacency
at
a
large
desk
table
on
which
briefs
and
drafts
and
letters
lay
in
seeming
confusion
he
rose
and
with
a
benignant
courtesy
invited
alfred
to
sit
down
and
explain
his
business
the
reader
is
aware
our
oxonian
could
make
a
close
and
luminous
statement
he
began
at
the
beginning
but
soon
disposed
of
preliminaries
and
came
to
his
capture
at
silverton
then
compton
quietly
rang
the
bell
and
with
a
slight
apology
to
alfred
requested
colls
to
search
for
the
draft
of
holloway
will
alfred
continued
compton
listened
keenly
noted
the
salient
points
on
a
sheet
of
and
demanded
the
exact
dates
of
every
important
event
related
the
story
finished
the
attorney
turned
to
colls
and
said
mighty
coolly
you
may
go
the
will
is
in
my
pocket
but
i
made
sure
he
was
a
madman
they
generally
are
these
exit
colls
got
a
copy
of
the
settlement
sir
under
which
you
take
this
ten
thousand
pounds
no
any
lawyer
seen
it
oh
yes
crauford
down
at
good
friend
of
mine
i
write
to
him
names
and
addresses
of
your
trustees
alfred
gave
them
you
have
brought
the
order
on
which
you
were
confined
and
the
two
certificates
not
i
said
alfred
i
have
begged
and
prayed
for
a
sight
of
them
and
never
could
get
one
that
is
one
of
the
galling
iniquities
of
the
system
i
call
it
double
shuffle
just
bring
your
mind
to
bear
on
this
sir
the
prisoner
whose
wits
and
liberty
have
been
signed
away
behind
his
back
is
not
allowed
to
see
the
order
and
certificate
on
which
he
is
confined
until
his
release
that
release
he
is
to
obtain
by
combating
the
statements
in
the
order
and
certificates
so
to
get
out
he
must
first
see
and
contradict
the
lies
that
put
him
in
but
to
see
the
lies
that
put
him
in
he
must
first
get
out
so
runs
the
circle
of
iniquity
now
is
that
the
injustice
of
earth
or
the
injustice
of
hell
compton
asked
a
moment
to
consider
well
i
think
is
of
the
earth
earthy
there
a
mixture
of
idiocy
in
it
the
devil
might
fairly
repudiate
young
gentleman
the
english
statutes
of
lunacy
are
famous
monuments
of
legislatorial
incapacity
and
indeed
as
a
general
rule
if
you
want
justice
and
wisdom
do
you
go
to
acts
of
parliament
but
to
the
common
law
of
alfred
did
not
appreciate
this
observation
he
made
no
reply
to
it
but
inquired
with
some
heat
what
he
could
do
to
punish
the
whole
gang
his
father
the
certifying
doctors
and
the
madhouse
keepers
humph
you
might
indict
them
all
for
a
conspiracy
said
compton
but
you
would
be
defeated
as
a
rule
avoid
criminal
proceedings
where
you
have
a
civil
remedy
a
jury
will
give
a
verdict
and
damages
where
they
would
not
convict
on
the
same
evidence
yours
is
just
one
of
those
cases
where
temper
says
but
prudence
says
and
law
through
john
compton
its
oracle
in
this
square
says
sue
the
defendant
and
no
other
now
who
is
the
true
defendant
here
or
party
liable
in
law
the
keeper
of
the
asylum
for
no
if
i
remember
right
all
proceedings
against
him
are
expressly
barred
by
a
provision
in
the
last
statute
let
us
he
took
down
the
statutes
of
the
realm
and
showed
alfred
the
clause
which
raises
the
proprietor
of
a
madhouse
above
the
civic
level
of
prince
royal
curse
the
law
said
alfred
bitterly
no
do
curse
the
law
curse
the
act
if
you
like
but
we
ca
get
on
without
the
law
neither
of
us
try
the
certifying
doctor
sir
humph
said
compton
knitting
his
brows
a
jury
might
give
you
a
verdict
but
it
would
probably
be
set
aside
by
the
full
court
or
else
by
a
court
of
error
for
unless
you
could
prove
informality
barefaced
negligence
or
fides
what
does
it
come
to
a
professional
man
bound
to
give
medical
opinions
to
all
comers
is
consulted
about
you
and
says
he
thinks
you
are
insane
you
turn
out
sane
well
then
he
was
mistaken
but
not
more
than
he
is
in
most
of
his
professional
opinions
we
lawyers
know
what
guesswork
medicine
is
we
see
it
in
the
i
hate
suing
opinions
it
is
like
firing
bullets
at
snipes
in
a
wind
try
alfred
groaned
why
there
is
nobody
left
but
the
rogue
who
signed
the
and
if
you
were
a
lawyer
that
alone
would
tell
you
he
is
the
defendant
where
a
legal
wrong
has
been
committed
by
a
and
and
there
is
no
remedy
against
or
there
must
either
be
one
against
or
none
at
all
but
this
law
abhors
as
nature
does
a
vacuum
besides
this
defendant
has
the
wrong
complained
of
in
his
person
you
sue
an
act
not
an
opinion
but
of
course
you
are
not
cool
enough
to
see
all
this
just
at
cool
sir
said
alfred
despairingly
i
am
frozen
with
your
remorseless
law
what
of
all
these
villains
may
i
only
attack
one
and
ca
i
imprison
even
him
as
he
has
me
such
narrow
law
encourages
men
to
violence
who
burn
under
wrongs
like
compton
looked
keenly
at
his
agitated
mortified
client
but
made
no
concession
he
gave
him
a
minute
to
digest
the
law
first
bitter
pill
and
then
said
if
i
am
to
act
for
you
you
had
better
write
a
line
to
the
commissioners
of
lunacy
requesting
them
to
hand
me
copies
of
the
order
and
alfred
wrote
it
and
now
said
compton
thoughtfully
i
do
think
they
will
venture
to
recapture
you
during
the
fourteen
days
but
still
they
might
and
we
attorneys
are
wary
animals
so
please
give
me
at
once
a
full
authority
to
act
under
advice
of
counsel
for
your
alfred
wrote
as
requested
and
compton
put
the
paper
in
his
drawer
remarking
with
this
i
can
proceed
by
law
or
equity
even
should
you
get
into
the
asylum
he
then
dismissed
alfred
somewhat
abruptly
but
with
an
invitation
to
call
again
after
three
clear
days
like
most
ardent
suitors
after
their
first
interview
with
passionless
law
he
went
away
sadly
chilled
and
so
home
to
his
cheerless
lodging
to
count
the
hours
till
he
could
see
julia
and
learn
his
fate
from
her
lips
this
very
morning
a
hasty
note
came
to
edward
from
folkestone
worded
thus
oh
edward
my
worst
misgivings
the
two
have
parted
poor
papa
has
taken
a
man
boat
and
is
in
sight
we
shall
follow
directly
in
a
steamboat
but
the
other
you
know
my
fears
you
must
be
father
and
mother
to
that
poor
child
till
i
come
home
your
sad
mother
lucy
julia
held
out
her
hand
for
the
note
edward
put
it
in
his
pocket
what
is
that
for
said
the
young
lady
why
surely
i
may
put
my
own
property
in
my
oh
certainly
i
only
want
to
look
at
it
excuse
are
you
in
earnest
edward
not
let
me
see
dear
mamma
letter
and
the
vivid
face
looked
piteously
surprised
oh
i
tell
you
the
contents
papa
had
got
to
folkestone
and
taken
a
boat
and
gone
to
sea
then
mamma
took
a
steamboat
and
after
him
so
she
will
soon
catch
him
and
is
not
that
a
comfort
oh
yes
cried
julia
and
was
for
some
time
too
interested
and
excited
to
think
of
anything
else
but
presently
she
returned
to
the
charge
anything
else
dear
humph
well
not
of
equal
oh
if
it
is
of
no
importance
there
can
be
no
reason
for
not
telling
me
what
was
it
edward
coloured
but
said
nothing
he
thought
however
and
thus
ran
his
thoughts
she
my
intellectual
superior
and
i
got
to
deceive
her
and
a
nice
mess
i
shall
make
of
it
of
importance
said
julia
eyeing
him
you
have
told
a
story
and
you
do
love
your
this
fulminated
she
drew
herself
up
proudly
and
was
silent
a
minute
afterwards
stealing
a
look
at
her
he
saw
her
eyes
suddenly
fill
with
tears
of
nothing
tangible
now
this
is
nice
said
he
to
himself
at
noon
she
put
on
her
bonnet
to
visit
her
district
he
put
on
his
hat
directly
and
accompanied
her
great
was
her
innocent
pleasure
at
that
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
done
her
the
honour
she
took
him
to
her
poor
people
and
showed
him
off
with
innocent
pride
hannah
this
is
my
then
in
a
whisper
is
he
beautiful
presently
she
saw
him
looking
pale
unheard
of
phenomenon
there
now
you
are
ill
said
she
come
home
directly
and
be
no
no
said
he
i
only
want
a
little
fresh
air
what
horrid
places
what
horrid
sights
and
smells
i
say
you
must
have
no
end
of
pluck
to
face
no
no
no
dearest
i
pray
for
strength
that
is
how
i
manage
and
oh
edward
you
used
to
think
the
poor
were
not
to
be
pitied
but
now
you
yes
i
see
and
smell
and
all
you
are
a
brave
good
girl
got
any
salts
about
you
yes
of
course
there
but
fancy
a
young
lion
smelling
a
young
duffer
you
mean
that
has
passed
for
game
through
the
thing
not
being
looked
into
oh
you
can

close
enough
where
i
want
you
to
be
no
answer
the
next
day
he
accompanied
her
again
but
remained
at
the
stairfoot
while
she
went
in
to
her
patients
and
when
she
came
down
asked
her
could
no
good
christian
be
found
to
knock
that
poor
woman
on
the
head
who
lived
in
a
plate
no
good
heathen
you
mean
said
julia
why
yes
said
he
the
savages
manage
these
things
he
also
accompanied
her
shopping
and
smoked
phlegmatically
outside
the
shops
nor
could
she
exhaust
his
patience
then
the
quick
girl
put
this
and
that
together
when
they
were
at
home
again
and
her
bonnet
off
she
looked
him
in
the
face
and
said
sweetly
i
have
got
a
he
smiled
and
said
nothing
why
do
you
answer
cried
julia
impetuously
because
least
said
is
soonest
mended
besides
i
down
upon
you
you
decoy
me
into
a
friendly
conversation
and
then
you
say
biting
things
if
i
bite
you
you
sting
me
such
want
of
confidence
oh
how
cruel
how
cruel
why
can
you
not
trust
me
am
i
a
child
no
one
is
young
who
has
suffered
what
i
have
suffered
secrets
disunite
a
family
and
we
were
so
united
and
then
you
are
so
stupid
keep
a
secret
yes
like
a
dog
in
a
chain
you
ca
hide
it
one
bit
you
have
undertaken
a
task
you
are
not
fit
for
sir
to
hide
a
secret
you
must
be
able
to
tell
fibs
and
you
ca
not
for
want
of
badness
but
cleverness
to
tell
them
smoothly
you
know
it
you
know
it
and
so
out
of
your
abominable
slyness
you
wo
say
a
word
there
it
is
no
use
my
trying
to
provoke
him
i
wish
you
were
not
so
so
apathetic
i
mean
of
then
with
one
of
her
old
rapid
transitions
she
began
to
caress
him
and
fawn
on
him
she
seated
him
in
an
and
herself
on
a
footstool
and
suddenly
curling
round
his
neck
murmured
dear
dear
brother
have
pity
on
a
poor
girl
and
tell
her
is
there
any
news
that
i
have
a
right
to
hear
only
mamma
has
given
you
your
orders
not
to
tell
me
tell
me
love
this
last
in
an
exquisite
whisper
let
me
alone
you
little
fascinating
demon
said
he
angrily
ask
mamma
i
wo
tell
you
a
thank
you
she
cried
bounding
to
her
feet
you
told
me
he
is
alive
he
loves
me
still
he
was
bewitched
seduced
deluded
he
has
come
to
himself
mamma
has
seen
him
he
wants
to
come
and
beg
my
pardon
but
you
are
all
afraid
i
shall
forgive
him
but
i
will
not
for
at
the
first
word
i
stop
his
mouth
and
say
you
were
happy
away
from
me
i
suppose
you
would
not
have
come
back
and
instantly
she
burst
out
singing
with
inspired
eloquence
and
defiance
castles
are
sacked
in
war
chieftains
are
scattered
far
truth
is
a
fixed
star
aileen
but
unable
to
sustain
it
the
poor
impetuosity
dropped
as
quickly
as
she
had
mounted
and
out
went
her
arm
on
the
table
and
her
forehead
sank
on
her
arm
and
the
tears
began
to
run
silently
down
the
sweet
face
so
brave
for
a
moment
w
will
y
you
allow
me
to
light
a
cigar
said
edward
i
wretched
and
miserable
you
tempest
in
petticoats
you
she
made
him
a
sign
of
assent
with
the
hand
that
was
dangling
languidly
but
she
did
not
speak
nor
did
she
appeal
to
him
any
more
alienation
was
commencing
but
what
was
worse
than
speaking
her
mind
she
was
for
ever
at
the
window
now
looking
up
and
down
the
street
and
walking
with
her
he
felt
her
arm
often
tremble
and
sometimes
jerk
the
secret
was
agitating
her
nerves
and
destroying
her
tranquillity
as
much
or
perhaps
more
than
if
she
had
known
all
dodd
wrote
from
portsmouth
whereof
anon
peterson
called
and
soon
after
him
hurd
edward
was
glad
to
see
them
especially
the
latter
whose
visits
seemed
always
to
do
julia
good
moreover
as
peterson
and
hurd
were
rivals
it
afforded
edward
an
innocent
amusement
to
see
their
aversion
to
one
another
and
the
admirable
address
and
delicacy
with
which
his
sister
conducted
herself
between
them
however
this
pastime
was
cut
short
by
sarah
coming
in
and
saying
there
a
young
man
wants
to
see
you
julia
looked
up
and
changed
colour
i
think
he
is
a
fireman
said
sarah
she
knew
very
well
he
was
a
fireman
and
also
one
of
her
followers
edward
went
out
and
found
one
of
his
late
brethren
who
told
him
a
young
gentleman
had
just
been
inquiring
for
him
at
the
station
what
was
he
like
why
i
was
a
good
ways
off
but
i
saw
he
was
a
tall
six
feet
full
give
you
his
name
no
i
did
speak
to
him
it
was
andrew
andrew
says
he
asked
if
there
was
a
fireman
called
dodd
so
andrew
said
you
had
left
then
the
swell
asked
where
you
lived
and
andrew
could
tell
him
any
more
than
it
was
in
pembroke
street
so
i
told
him
says
i
could
you
call
me
it
is
number
says
i
he
is
coming
back
says
andrew
however
i
thought
i
come
and
tell
and
so
get
a
word
with
sarah
you
sly
dog
edward
thanked
him
and
put
on
his
hat
directly
for
he
could
not
disguise
from
himself
that
this
visitor
might
be
alfred
hardie
indeed
what
more
likely
hurd
and
peterson
always
tried
to
stay
one
another
out
whenever
they
met
at
pembroke
street
however
to
make
sure
of
not
leaving
julia
alone
edward
went
in
and
asked
them
both
to
luncheon
at
which
time
he
said
he
should
be
back
as
he
walked
rapidly
to
the
station
he
grew
more
and
more
convinced
that
it
was
alfred
hardie
and
his
reflections
ran
like
this
what
a
headpiece
mamma
has
but
it
did
not
strike
her
he
would
come
to
me
first
yet
how
plain
that
looks
now
for
of
course
i
the
duffer
only
clue
to
julia
these
madmen
are
no
fools
though
and
how
quiet
he
was
that
night
and
he
made
papa
go
down
the
ladder
first
that
was
the
old
alfred
hardie
he
was
always
generous
vain
overhearing
saucy
but
noble
with
it
all
i
liked
him
he
was
a
man
that
showed
you
his
worst
and
let
you
find
his
best
out
by
degrees
he
hated
to
be
beat
but
that
no
crime
he
was
a
beautiful
oar
and
handled
his
mawleys
uncommon
he
sparred
with
all
the
prizefighters
that
came
to
oxford
and
took
punishment
better
than
you
would
think
and
a
wonderful
quick
hitter
alec
reed
owned
that
poor
taff
hardie
and
when
i
think
that
god
has
overthrown
his
powerful
mind
and
left
me
mine
such
as
it
is
but
the
worst
is
my
having
gone
on
calling
him
wretch
all
this
time
and
nothing
too
bad
for
him
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
it
grieves
me
very
much
found
make
a
note
on
never
judge
a
fellow
behind
his
back
arrived
at
the
station
he
inquired
whether
his
friend
had
called
again
and
was
answered
in
the
negative
he
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
with
the
superintendent
permission
wrote
a
note
to
alfred
inviting
him
to
dine
at
simpson
at
six
and
left
it
with
the
fireman
this
done
he
was
about
to
return
home
when
another
thought
struck
him
he
got
a
messenger
and
sent
off
a
single
line
to
wolf
to
tell
him
alfred
hardie
would
be
at
simpson
at
seven
o
clock
but
when
the
messenger
was
gone
he
regretted
what
he
had
done
he
had
done
it
for
alfred
good
but
still
it
was
treason
he
felt
unhappy
and
wended
his
way
homeward
disconsolately
realising
more
and
more
that
he
had
not
brains
for
the
difficulties
imposed
upon
him
on
entering
pembroke
street
he
heard
a
buzz
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
considerable
crowd
collected
in
a
semicircle
why
that
is
near
our
house
he
said
and
quickened
his
steps
when
he
got
near
he
saw
that
all
the
people
eyes
were
bent
on
no
he
dashed
into
the
crowd
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
he
cried
the
matter
plenty
the
matter
young
man
cried
one
murder
the
matter
said
another
at
that
he
turned
pale
as
death
an
intelligent
man
saw
his
violent
agitation
and
asked
him
hurriedly
if
he
belonged
to
the
house
yes
for
mercy
sake
what
is
it
make
way
there
shouted
the
man
he
belongs
sir
a
madman
has
broke
loose
and
got
into
your
house

sorry
to
say

has

alfred
hardie
spent
three
days
writhing
in
his
little
lodging
his
situation
had
been
sadder
but
never
more
irritating
by
right
possessor
of
thousands
yet
in
fact
reduced
to
one
suit
two
shirts
and
rich
in
intellect
yet
hunted
as
a
madman
affianced
to
the
loveliest
girl
in
england
yet
afraid
to
go
near
her
for
fear
of
being
torn
from
her
again
and
for
ever
all
this
could
last
but
one
week
more
but
a
week
positive
torture
was
no
trifle
to
contemplate
with
a
rival
at
his
julia
ear
all
the
time
suppose
she
should
have
been
faithful
all
these
months
but
in
this
last
week
should
be
worn
out
and
give
herself
to
another
such
things
had
been
known
he
went
to
lincoln
inn
with
this
irritating
fear
tearing
him
like
a
vulture
compton
received
him
cheerfully
and
told
him
he
had
begun
operations
in
hardie
hardie
had
written
to
thomas
hardie
two
days
ago
and
inquired
his
london
solicitor
and
whether
that
gentleman
would
accept
service
of
the
writ
in
hardie
hardie
to
thomas
hardie
why
what
has
he
to
do
with
it
asked
alfred
he
is
the
defendant
in
the
then
seeing
amazement
and
incredulity
on
alfred
face
he
explained
that
the
commissioners
of
lunacy
had
treated
him
with
great
courtesy
had
at
once
furnished
him
with
copies
not
only
of
the
order
and
certificates
but
of
other
valuable
documents
and
there
said
he
lies
the
order
signed
by
thomas
hardie
of
clare
court
curse
his
impudence
cried
alfred
in
a
fury
why
sir
he
is
next
door
to
an
idiot
what
does
that
matter
ah
now
if
i
had
gone
in
a
passion
and
indicted
him
there
would
be
a
defence
directly
malice
defendant
being
compos
whereas
by
gently
quietly
suing
him
even
if
he
was
a
lunatic
we
would
make
him
or
his
estate
pay
a
round
sum
for
falsely
imprisoning
a
sane
briton
here
is
counsel
opinion
on
your
case
and
he
handed
him
a
short
opinion
of
a
distinguished
counsel
the
concluding
words
of
which
were
these
if
the
certificates
and
order
are
in
legal
form
and
were
made
and
given
fide
no
action
lies
for
the
capture
or
detention
of
hardie
why
it
is
dead
against
me
said
alfred
there
goes
the
one
rotten
reed
you
had
left
singularly
dead
said
the
attorney
coolly
he
does
not
even
say
am
of
opinion
he
is
in
great
practice
and
hardworked
in
his
hurry
he
has
taken
up
the
lunacy
acts
and
has
forgotten
that
the
rights
of
sane
englishmen
are
not
the
creatures
of
these
little
trumpery
statutes
no
thank
you
our
rights
are
centuries
older
and
prevail
wherever
by
good
luck
the
statutes
of
the
realm
are
silent
now
they
are
all
silent
about
incarcerating
sane
men
besides
he
gives
no
cases
what
is
an
opinion
without
a
precedent
a
lawyer
guess
i
thought
so
little
of
his
opinion
that
i
sent
the
case
to
a
clever
junior
who
has
got
time
to
think
before
he
colls
entered
soon
after
with
the
said
opinion
compton
opened
it
and
saying
now
let
us
see
what
he
says
read
it
to
alfred
it
ran
thus
there
was
clearly
a
right
of
action
under
the
common
law
and
it
has
been
exercised
brothers
paternoster
wynn
such
a
right
can
only
be
annulled
by
the
express
terms
of
a
statute
now
the
and
victoria
cap
sect
so
annuls
it
as
against
the
madhouse
proprietor
only
that
therefore
is
the
statutory
exception
and
tends
to
confirm
the
common
right
if
the
facts
are
as
represented
on
which
of
course
i
can
form
no
opinion
hardie
can
safely
sue
the
person
who
signed
the
order
for
his
alleged
false
imprisonment
i
agree
with
you
that
the
usual
course
by
praying
the
court
of
chancery
for
a
commission
de
lunatico
inquirendo
is
timorous
and
rests
on
prejudice
if
successful
is
saddled
with
his
own
costs
and
sometimes
with
deft
and
obtains
no
compensation
it
seems
clear
that
a
jury
sitting
at
nisi
prius
can
deal
as
well
with
the
main
fact
as
can
a
jury
sitting
by
the
order
of
the
chancellor
and
i
need
not
say
the
costs
will
go
with
their
verdict
to
say
nothing
of
the
damages
which
may
be
heavy
on
the
other
hand
an
indictment
is
hazardous
and
i
think
you
can
lose
nothing
by
beginning
with
the
suit
by
having
a
shorthand
writer
at
the
trial
you
may
collect
materials
for
an
indictment
and
also
feel
the
pulse
of
the
court
you
can
then
confer
upon
the
evidence
with
some
counsel
better
versed
in
criminal
law
than
myself
advice
is
to
sue
thomas
hardie
and
declare
in
tort
signed
barrow
i
have
been
thus
particular
because
hardie
hardie
if
carried
to
a
verdict
will
probably
be
a
leading
who
shall
decide
when
counsel
disagree
inquired
alfred
satirically
that
depends
on
where
they
do
it
if
in
court
the
judge
if
here
the
you
appear
sanguine
compton
said
alfred
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
advancing
me
a
little
money
i
only
it
is
all
ready
for
you
in
this
drawer
said
compton
cheerfully
see
thirty
sovereigns
then
you
need
not
go
to
a
what
you
knew
i
should
borrow
do
all
my
clients
begin
by
bleeding
it
is
the
rule
of
this
then
why
do
you
give
up
business
because
i
bleed
the
opposite
attorney
client
a
pound
or
two
more
than
my
own
bleeds
he
then
made
alfred
sign
a
promissory
note
for
the
thirty
pounds
advised
him
to
keep
snug
for
one
week
more
and
promised
to
write
to
him
in
two
days
and
send
thomas
hardie
answer
alfred
left
his
address
and
went
from
compton
a
lighter
man
convinced
of
his
courage
and
prudence
he
shifted
one
care
off
his
own
shoulders
and
thought
of
love
alone
but
strange
as
it
may
appear
two
cares
are
sometimes
better
for
a
man
than
one
alfred
having
now
no
worry
to
divert
him
from
his
deeper
anxiety
was
all
love
and
jealousy
and
quite
overbalanced
the
desire
of
his
heart
grew
so
strong
it
overpowered
alike
his
patience
and
his
prudence
he
jumped
into
a
cab
and
drove
to
all
the
firemen
stations
on
the
surrey
side
of
the
river
inquiring
for
edward
at
last
he
hit
upon
the
right
one
and
learned
that
julia
lived
in
pembroke
street
number
unknown
he
drove
home
to
his
lodgings
bought
some
clothes
and
dressed
like
a
gentleman
then
told
the
cabman
to
drive
to
pembroke
street
he
knew
he
was
acting
imprudently
but
he
could
not
help
it
and
besides
compton
had
now
written
to
his
uncle
and
begun
the
attack
that
would
surely
intimidate
his
enemies
and
turn
their
thoughts
to
defence
not
to
fresh
offence
however
catching
sight
of
a
gunsmith
shop
on
the
way
he
suddenly
resolved
to
arm
himself
on
the
bare
chance
of
an
attack
he
stopped
the
cab
went
in
and
bought
a
pistol
with
bullets
wads
and
caps
complete
this
he
loaded
in
the
cab
and
felt
quite
prudent
after
it
the
prudence
of
youth
he
paid
off
the
cab
in
pembroke
street
and
set
about
the
task
of
discovering
julia
he
inquired
at
several
houses
but
was
unsuccessful
then
he
walked
slowly
all
down
the
street
looking
up
at
all
the
windows
and
i
think
if
he
had
done
this
the
day
before
he
might
have
seen
her
or
she
him
she
was
so
often
at
the
window
now
but
just
then
she
had
company
to
keep
her
in
order
he
was
unlucky
in
another
respect
edward
came
out
of
no
and
went
up
the
street
when
he
himself
was
going
down
it
not
so
very
many
yards
off
if
alfred
face
had
only
been
turned
the
other
way
he
would
have
seen
edward
and
all
would
have
gone
differently
the
stoutest
hearts
have
their
moments
of
weakness
and
deep
dejection
few
timings
are
more
certain
and
less
realised
by
ordinary
men
than
this
from
palissy
fighting
with
enamel
to
layard
disinterring
a
city
this
thing
is
so
unable
to
find
julia
in
the
very
street
she
inhabited
alfred
felt
weak
against
fate
he
said
to
himself
if
i
find
her
i
shall
perhaps
wish
i
had
never
sought
in
his
hour
of
dejection
stern
reason
would
be
heard
and
asked
him
whether
all
archbold
had
said
could
be
pure
invention
and
he
was
obliged
to
confess
that
was
too
unlikely
then
he
felt
so
sick
at
heart
he
was
half
minded
to
turn
and
fly
the
street
but
there
was
a
large
yard
close
by
him
entered
by
a
broad
and
lofty
gateway
cut
through
one
of
the
houses
the
yard
belonged
to
a
dealer
in
hay
two
empty
waggons
were
there
but
no
men
visible
being
their
alfred
slipped
in
here
and
sat
down
on
the
shaft
of
a
waggon
and
let
his
courage
ooze
he
sighed
and
sighed
and
feared
to
know
his
fate
and
so
he
sat
with
his
face
in
his
hands
unmanned
presently
a
strain
of
music
broke
on
his
ear
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
street
he
raised
his
head
to
listen
he
coloured
his
eyes
sparkled
he
stole
out
on
tiptoe
with
wondering
inquiring
face
into
the
street
once
there
he
stood
thrilling
from
his
heart
that
seemed
now
on
fire
to
his
fingers
ends
for
a
heavenly
voice
was
singing
to
the
piano
just
above
his
head
singing
in
earnest
making
the
very
street
ring
already
listeners
were
gathering
and
a
woman
of
the
people
said
it
a
soul
singing
without
a
amazing
good
things
are
said
in
the
streets
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
julia
the
song
was
aileen
aroon
the
hymn
of
constancy
so
sudden
and
full
was
the
bliss
which
poured
into
the
long
and
listener
at
this
sudden
answer
to
his
fears
that
tears
of
joy
trembled
in
his
eyes
that
i
was
to
doubt
her
he
said
and
unable
to
contain
his
longing
unable
to
wait
and
listen
even
to
that
which
had
changed
his
griefs
and
doubts
into
rapture
he
was
at
the
door
in
a
moment
a
servant
opened
it
miss
dodd
he
said
or
rather
panted
you
need
not
announce
me
i
am
an
old
he
could
not
bear
any
one
should
see
the
meeting
between
him
and
his
beloved
he
went
up
the
steep
and
narrow
stair
guided
by
the
hymn
of
constancy
he
stopped
at
the
door
his
heart
was
beating
so
violently
then
he
turned
the
handle
softly
and
stepped
into
the
it
was
a
double
room
he
took
two
steps
and
was
in
the
opening
and
almost
at
julia
back
two
young
clergymen
were
bending
devotedly
one
on
each
side
of
her
it
was
to
them
she
was
singing
the
hymn
of
constancy
alfred
started
back
as
if
he
had
been
stung
and
the
music
stopped
dead
short
for
she
had
heard
his
step
and
womanlike
was
looking
into
her
companions
eyes
first
to
see
if
her
ear
had
deceived
her
what
she
saw
there
brought
her
slowly
round
with
a
wild
look
her
hands
rose
toward
her
face
and
she
shrank
away
sideways
from
him
as
if
he
was
a
serpent
and
her
dilated
eyes
looked
over
her
cringing
shoulder
at
him
and
she
was
pale
and
red
and
pale
and
red
a
dozen
times
in
as
many
seconds
he
eyed
her
sorrowfully
and
sternly
taking
for
shame
that
strange
mixture
of
emotions
which
possessed
her
and
so
they
met
strange
meeting
for
two
true
lovers
who
had
parted
last
upon
their
wedding
eve
no
doubt
if
they
had
been
alone
one
or
other
would
have
spoken
directly
but
the
situation
was
complicated
by
the
presence
of
two
rivals
and
this
tied
their
tongues
they
devoured
one
another
with
their
eyes
in
silence
and
then
julia
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
and
began
to
tremble
from
head
to
foot
as
she
looked
at
him
is
this
intrusion
agreeable
to
you
miss
dodd
said
hurd
respectfully
by
way
of
courting
her
she
made
no
reply
but
only
looked
wildly
at
alfred
still
and
quivered
visibly
pray
sir
said
alfred
turning
on
hurd
have
you
any
right
to
interfere
between
us
two
none
whatever
said
julia
hastily
mr
hurd
i
need
no
one
i
will
permit
no
one
to
say
a
word
to
him
hardie
knows
he
can
not
enter
a
house
where
i
am
without
an
what
before
a
couple
of
curates
do
not
be
insolent
to
my
friends
sir
said
julia
panting
this
wounded
alfred
deeply
oh
as
you
please
said
he
only
if
you
put
me
on
my
defence
before
strangers
i
shall
perhaps
put
you
to
the
blush
before
why
do
you
come
here
sir
said
julia
not
deigning
to
notice
his
threat
to
see
my
oh
indeed
said
she
bitterly
in
that
case
why
have
you
postponed
your
visit
so
long
i
was
in
in
prison
in
the
worst
of
all
prisons
where
i
was
put
because
i
loved
you
where
i
was
detained
because
i
persisted
in
loving
you
you
faithless
inconstant
he
choked
at
these
words
she
smiled
a
faint
uncertain
smile
it
died
away
and
she
shook
her
head
and
said
sadly
defend
yourself
and
then
call
me
as
many
names
as
you
like
where
was
this
prison
it
was
an
asylum
a
the
girl
stared
at
him
bewildered
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
took
peggy
letter
read
that
he
said
she
held
it
in
her
hand
and
looked
him
in
the
face
to
divine
the
contents
read
it
said
he
almost
fiercely
that
was
the
she
held
it
shaking
in
her
hands
and
stared
at
it
i
do
know
whether
she
read
it
or
not
he
went
on
the
same
villain
who
defrauded
your
father
of
his
money
robbed
me
of
my
wife
and
my
liberty
that
silverton
house
was
a
lunatic
asylum
and
ever
since
then
oh
julia
the
agony
of
that
day
i
have
been
confined
in
one
or
other
of
those
hells
sane
amongst
the
mad
till
drayton
house
took
fire
and
i
escaped
for
what
to
be
put
on
my
defence
by
you
what
have
you
suffered
from
our
separations
compared
with
the
manifold
anguish
i
have
endured
that
you
dare
to
receive
the
most
injured
and
constant
of
mankind
like
this
you
who
have
had
your
liberty
all
this
time
and
have
consoled
yourself
for
my
absence
with
a
couple
of
curates
for
shame
said
julia
blushing
to
the
forehead
yet
smiling
in
a
way
her
companions
could
not
understand
miss
dodd
will
you
put
up
with
these
insults
said
hurd
ay
and
a
thousand
more
cried
julia
radiant
and
thank
heaven
for
them
they
prove
his
sincerity
you
who
have
thought
proper
to
stay
and
hear
me
insult
my
betrothed
and
put
my
superior
on
his
defence
look
how
i
receive
his
just
rebuke
dear
cruelly
used
alfred
i
never
doubted
you
in
my
heart
no
not
for
a
moment
forgive
me
for
taunting
you
to
clear
yourself
you
who
were
always
the
soul
of
truth
and
honour
forgive
me
i
too
have
suffered
for
i
thought
my
alfred
was
dead
forgive
and
with
this
she
was
sinking
slowly
to
her
knees
with
the
most
touching
grace
all
blushes
tears
penitence
happiness
and
love
but
he
caught
her
eagerly
oh
god
forbid
he
cried
and
in
a
moment
her
head
was
on
his
shoulder
and
they
mingled
their
tears
together
it
was
julia
who
recovered
herself
first
and
shrank
from
him
a
little
and
murmured
we
are
not
the
misgiving
came
rather
late
and
they
were
alone
the
other
gentlemen
had
comprehended
at
last
that
it
was
indelicate
to
remain
they
had
melted
quietly
away
and
peterson
rushed
down
the
street
but
hurd
hung
disconsolate
about
that
very
entry
where
alfred
had
just
desponded
before
him
sit
by
me
my
poor
darling
and
tell
me
all
said
julia
he
began
but
ere
he
had
told
her
about
his
first
day
at
his
first
asylum
she
moaned
and
turned
faint
at
the
recital
and
her
lovely
head
sank
on
his
shoulder
he
kissed
her
and
tried
to
comfort
her
and
said
he
would
not
tell
her
any
more
but
she
said
somewhat
characteristically
i
insist
on
your
telling
me
all
all
it
will
kill
which
did
not
seem
to
alfred
a
cogent
reason
for
continuing
his
narrative
he
varied
it
by
telling
her
that
through
all
his
misery
the
thought
of
her
had
sustained
him
alas
in
the
midst
of
their
elysium
a
rough
voice
was
heard
in
the
passage
inquiring
for
hardie
alfred
started
up
in
dismay
for
it
was
rooke
voice
i
am
undone
he
cried
they
are
coming
to
take
me
again
and
if
they
do
they
will
drug
me
i
am
a
dead
fly
cried
julia
fly
upstairs
the
he
darted
to
the
door
and
out
on
the
landing
it
was
too
late
rooke
had
just
turned
the
corner
of
the
stairs
and
saw
him
he
whistled
and
rushed
after
alfred
alfred
bounded
up
the
next
flight
of
stairs
but
even
as
he
went
his
fighting
blood
got
up
he
remembered
his
pistol
he
drew
it
turned
on
the
upper
landing
and
levelled
the
weapon
full
at
rooke
forehead
the
man
recoiled
with
a
yell
and
got
to
a
respectful
distance
on
the
second
landing
there
he
began
to
parley
come
hardie
sir
said
he
that
is
past
a
joke
would
you
murder
a
man
it
no
murder
to
kill
an
assassin
in
defence
of
life
or
liberty
and
i
kill
you
rooke
as
i
would
kill
a
wasp
if
you
lay
a
finger
on
do
you
hear
that
shouted
rooke
to
some
one
below
ay
i
hear
replied
the
voice
of
hayes
then
loose
the
dog
and
run
in
after
there
was
a
terrible
silence
then
a
scratching
was
heard
below
and
above
the
deadly
click
of
the
brought
to
full
cock
and
then
there
was
a
heavy
pattering
rush
and
vulcan
came
charging
up
the
stairs
like
a
lion
he
was
but
that
alfred
did
not
know
he
stepped
forward
and
fired
at
the
tremendous
brute
somewhat
unsteadily
and
missed
him
by
an
inch
the
bullet
glanced
off
the
stairs
and
entered
the
wall
within
a
yard
of
rooke
head
ere
alfred
could
fire
again
the
huge
brute
leaped
on
him
and
knocked
him
down
like
a
child
and
made
a
grab
at
his
throat
alfred
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
seized
a
banister
and
drawing
himself
up
put
the
pistol
to
vulcan
ear
and
fired
the
other
barrel
just
as
rooke
rushed
up
the
stairs
to
secure
his
prisoner
the
dog
bounded
into
the
air
and
fell
over
dead
with
shattered
skull
leaving
alfred
bespattered
with
blood
and
brains
and
half
blinded
but
he
struggled
up
and
tore
the
banister
out
in
doing
so
just
as
a
heavy
body
fell
forward
at
his
feet
it
was
rooke
stumbling
over
vulcan
carcass
so
unexpectedly
thrown
in
his
path
alfred
cleared
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
as
rooke
struggled
up
lifted
the
banister
high
above
his
head
and
with
his
long
sinewy
arm
and
elastic
body
discharged
a
blow
frightful
to
look
at
for
youth
strength
skill
and
hate
all
swelled
and
rose
and
struck
together
in
that
one
furious
gesture
if
the
wood
had
held
the
skull
must
have
gone
as
it
was
the
banister
broke
over
the
man
head
and
one
half
went
spinning
up
to
the
ceiling
the
man
head
cracked
under
the
banister
like
a
glass
bottle
and
rooke
lay
flat
and
mute
within
the
blood
running
from
his
nose
and
ears
alfred
hurled
the
remnant
of
the
banister
down
at
hayes
and
the
others
and
darted
into
a
room
it
was
julia
bedroom
and
was
heard
to
open
the
window
and
then
drag
furniture
to
the
door
and
barricade
it
this
done
he
went
to
load
his
pistol
which
he
thought
he
had
slipped
into
his
pocket
after
felling
rooke
he
found
to
his
dismay
it
was
not
there
the
fact
was
it
had
slipped
past
his
pocket
and
fallen
down
during
the
fight
shriek
upon
shriek
issued
from
the
but
now
all
was
still
on
the
stairs
lay
vulcan
dead
rooke
senseless
below
julia
in
a
dead
faint
and
all
in
little
more
than
a
minute
wolf
arrived
with
the
police
and
two
more
keepers
new
ones
in
the
place
of
wales
and
garrett
discharged
and
urged
them
to
break
into
the
bedroom
and
capture
the
maniac
but
first
he
was
cautious
enough
to
set
two
of
them
to
watch
the
back
of
the
house
there
he
said
where
that
load
of
hay
is
going
in
that
is
the
way
to
it
now
stand
you
in
the
yard
and
this
last
mandate
was
readily
complied
with
for
there
was
not
much
to
be
feared
on
the
stones
below
from
a
maniac
on
the
second
story
but
to
break
open
that
bedroom
door
was
quite
another
thing
the
stairs
were
like
a
shambles
already
a
chilling
sight
to
the
eyes
of
mercenary
valour
rooke
was
but
just
sensible
the
others
hung
back
but
presently
the
pistol
was
found
sticking
in
a
pool
of
gore
this
put
a
new
face
on
the
matter
and
wolf
himself
showed
the
qualities
of
a
commander
he
sent
down
word
to
his
sentinels
in
the
yard
to
be
prepared
for
any
attempt
on
alfred
part
however
desperate
and
he
sent
a
verbal
message
to
a
stately
gentleman
who
was
sitting
anxious
in
lodgings
over
the
way
after
bribing
high
ad
low
giving
out
money
like
water
to
secure
the
recapture
and
so
escape
what
he
called
his
unnatural
vengeance
for
he
knew
him
to
be
by
nature
bold
and
vindictive
like
himself
after
these
preliminaries
doctor
wolf
headed
his
remaining
forces
to
wit
two
keepers
and
two
policemen
and
thundered
at
the
bedroom
door
and
summoned
alfred
to
surrender
now
among
the
spectators
who
watched
and
listened
with
bated
breath
was
one
to
whom
this
scene
had
an
interest
of
its
own
hurd
disconcerted
by
alfred
sudden
reappearance
and
the
reconciliation
had
hung
about
the
entry
very
miserable
for
he
was
sincerely
attached
to
julia
but
while
he
was
in
this
stupor
came
the
posse
to
recapture
alfred
and
he
heard
them
say
so
then
the
shots
were
fired
within
then
wolf
and
his
men
got
in
and
hurd
who
was
now
at
the
door
got
in
with
them
to
protect
julia
and
see
this
dangerous
and
inconvenient
character
disposed
of
he
was
looking
demurely
on
at
a
safish
distance
when
his
late
triumphant
rival
was
summoned
to
surrender
no
reply
wolf
coaxed
no
reply
wolf
told
him
he
had
police
as
well
as
keepers
and
resistance
would
be
idle
no
reply
wolf
ordered
his
men
to
break
in
the
door
after
some
little
delay
one
of
the
keepers
applied
a
chisel
while
a
policeman
held
his
truncheon
ready
to
defend
the
operator
the
lock
gave
way
but
the
door
could
not
open
for
furniture
after
some
further
delay
they
took
it
off
its
hinges
and
the
room
stood
revealed
to
their
surprise
no
rush
was
made
at
them
the
maniac
was
not
even
in
sight
he
is
down
upon
his
luck
whispered
one
of
the
new
keepers
we
shall
find
him
crouched
they
looked
under
the
bed
he
was
not
there
they
opened
a
cupboard
three
or
four
dresses
hung
from
wooden
pegs
they
searched
the
gowns
most
minutely
but
found
no
maniac
hid
in
their
ample
folds
presently
some
soot
was
observed
lying
in
the
grate
and
it
was
inferred
he
had
gone
up
the
chimney
on
inspection
the
opening
appeared
almost
too
narrow
then
wolf
questioned
his
sentinels
in
the
yard
have
you
been
there
all
the
time
yes
seen
nothing
no
sir
and
our
eyes
have
never
been
off
the
window
and
the
here
was
a
mystery
and
not
a
clue
to
its
solution
the
window
was
open
but
feet
above
the
paved
yard
had
he
leaped
down
he
must
have
been
dashed
to
pieces
many
tongues
began
to
go
at
once
in
the
midst
of
which
edward
burst
in
and
found
the
two
dead
men
of
contemporary
history
consisted
of
a
dead
dog
and
a
stunned
man
who
having
a
head
like
a
bullet
was
now
come
to
himself
and
vowing
vengeance
he
found
julia
very
pale
supported
and
consoled
by
hurd
he
was
congratulating
her
on
her
escape
from
a
dangerous
maniac
she
rose
and
tottered
away
from
him
to
her
brother
and
clung
to
him
he
said
what
he
could
to
encourage
her
then
deposited
her
in
an
and
went
upstairs
he
soon
satisfied
himself
alfred
was
not
in
the
house
on
this
he
requested
wolf
and
his
men
to
leave
the
premises
the
doctor
demurred
edward
insisted
and
challenged
him
to
show
a
magistrate
warrant
for
entering
a
private
house
the
doctor
was
obliged
to
own
he
had
none
edward
then
told
the
policemen
they
were
engaged
in
an
illegal
act
the
police
had
no
authority
to
take
part
in
these
captures
now
the
police
knew
that
very
well
but
being
handsomely
bribed
they
had
presumed
and
not
for
the
first
time
upon
that
ignorance
of
law
which
is
deemed
an
essential
part
of
a
private
citizen
accomplishments
in
modern
days
in
a
word
by
temper
and
firmness
and
a
smattering
of
law
gathered
from
the
omniscient
edward
cleared
his
castle
of
the
lawless
crew
but
they
paraded
the
street
and
watched
the
yard
till
dusk
when
its
proprietor
ran
rusty
and
turned
them
out
julia
sat
between
edward
and
hurd
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
her
eyes
closed
and
received
in
silence
their
congratulations
on
her
escape
she
was
thinking
of
his
when
they
had
quite
done
she
opened
her
eyes
and
said
send
for
sampson
nobody
else
knows
anything
oh
pray
pray
pray
send
for
hurd
said
he
would
go
for
sampson
she
thanked
him
warmly
then
she
crept
away
to
her
bedroom
and
locked
herself
in
and
sat
on
the
hearthrug
and
thought
and
thought
and
recalled
every
word
and
tone
of
her
alfred
comparing
things
old
and
new
sampson
was
a
few
miles
out
of
town
visiting
a
patient
it
was
nine
in
the
evening
when
he
got
julia
note
but
he
came
on
to
pembroke
street
at
once
wolf
and
his
men
had
retired
leaving
a
sentinel
in
the
street
on
the
bare
chance
of
alfred
returning
sampson
found
brother
and
sister
sitting
sadly
but
lovingly
together
julia
rose
upon
his
entrance
oh
doctor
sampson
now
he
what
they
say
he
is
how
can
i
tell
till
i
see
objected
the
doctor
but
you
know
they
call
people
mad
who
are
nothing
of
the
kind
for
you
said
sampson
readily
assented
to
this
why
it
was
but
last
year
a
surjin
came
to
me
with
one
jackson
a
tailor
and
said
sign
a
certificate
for
this
man
his
wife
mad
me
see
her
sid
i
for
sis
he
her
own
husband
applies
me
sis
i
not
a
bat
i
saampson
i
went
to
see
her
she
was
nairvous
and
excited
i
know
what
you
come
about
said
she
you
are
mistaken
i
questioned
her
kindly
and
she
told
me
her
husband
was
a
great
trile
t
her
nairves
i
refused
to
sign
on
that
dis
the
tailor
drown
himself
in
the
canal
nixt
day
he
was
the
madman
and
she
knew
it
all
the
time
but
would
tell
us
and
that
a
woman
all
well
then
said
julia
hopefully
ay
but
said
sampson
these
cases
are
exceptions
after
all
and
the
chances
are
nine
to
one
he
mad
dau
ye
remember
that
was
one
of
the
solutions
offered
ye
whem
he
levanted
on
his
he
added
satirically
and
could
all
that
logic
keep
in
a
little
reason
this
cynical
speech
struck
julia
to
the
heart
she
could
not
bear
it
and
retired
to
her
own
room
then
sampson
saw
his
mistake
and
said
to
edward
with
some
concern
maircy
on
us
she
is
not
in
love
with
him
still
is
she
i
thought
that
young
parson
was
the
man
edward
shook
his
head
but
declined
to
go
much
into
a
topic
so
delicate
as
his
sister
affections
and
just
then
an
alarming
letter
was
delivered
from
dodd
she
wrote
to
the
effect
that
david
favoured
by
the
wind
had
run
into
portsmouth
harbour
before
their
eyes
and
had
disappeared
hidden
it
was
feared
by
one
of
those
low
publicans
who
provide
bad
ships
with
sailors
receiving
a
commission
on
this
an
earnest
conversation
between
sampson
and
edward
it
was
interrupted
in
its
turn
julia
burst
suddenly
into
the
room
pale
and
violently
excited
clasping
her
hands
and
crying
he
is
his
voice
is
like
a
child
oh
help
me
he
is
hurt
he
is
chapter
xlvi
julia
as
i
have
said
went
to
her
own
room
wounded
unintentionally
by
a
chance
speech
she
sat
down
sick
at
heart
and
presently
opened
her
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
starry
night
and
wondered
where
alfred
was
now
that
alfred
for
whom
nobody
else
had
a
human
heart
it
seemed
alfred
my
poor
alfred
she
sighed
and
to
hear
him
reply
then
she
said
to
herself
they
all
called
you
false
but
me
yet
i
was
right
and
now
they
all
call
you
mad
but
not
i
i
believe
nothing
against
you
you
are
my
own
alfred
still
where
have
the
wretches
driven
you
to
at
this
her
feelings
carried
her
away
and
she
cried
aloud
on
him
despairingly
and
leaned
upon
the
and
the
tears
ran
fast
for
him
presently
out
of
the
silence
of
the
night
seemed
to
struggle
a
faint
but
clear
voice
she
started
and
a
muffled
scream
came
from
her
then
she
listened
all
trembling
again
the
voice
sighed
faintly
but
clear
julia
alfred
said
she
quavering
yes
pray
be
cautious
give
no
alarm
the
house
is
watched
bring
she
flew
downstairs
and
electrified
edward
and
sampson
with
the
news
oh
promise
me
not
to
betray
him
she
cried
hut
said
the
doctor
starting
to
his
feet
what
should
we
betray
him
for
i
cure
him
for
you
i
can
cure
any
lunatic
that
has
lucid
intervals
where
is
he
follow
me
gasped
julia
stay
i
get
rid
of
the
servants
first
i
not
play
the
fool
and
betray
him
to
his
she
sent
sarah
eastward
and
jane
westward
and
then
led
the
way
through
the
kitchen
door
into
the
yard
they
all
searched
about
and
found
nothing
then
julia
begged
them
to
be
silent
she
whispered
alfred
and
instantly
a
faint
voice
issued
from
the
top
of
a
waggon
laden
with
hay
and
covered
with
a
tarpaulin
they
all
stood
staring
who
are
those
with
you
asked
alfred
uneasily
only
friends
dear
edward
and
ned
old
fellow
groaned
alfred
you
pulled
me
out
of
the
fire
you
help
me
out
of
this
i
think
my
leg
is
at
this
julia
wrung
her
hands
and
edward
ran
into
the
house
for
his
rope
and
threw
it
over
the
waggon
he
told
julia
and
sampson
to
hold
on
by
one
end
and
seizing
the
other
was
up
on
the
waggon
in
a
moment
he
felt
about
till
he
came
to
a
protuberance
and
that
was
alfred
under
the
tarpaulin
in
which
he
had
cut
with
his
penknife
edward
sent
julia
in
for
a
and
soon
made
an
enormous
slit
through
this
a
figure
emerged
into
the
moonlight
and
seemed
wonderfully
tall
to
have
been
so
hidden
his
hands
being
uninjured
he
easily
descended
the
rope
and
stood
on
one
leg
holding
it
then
sampson
and
edward
put
each
an
arm
under
his
and
helped
him
into
the
house
after
the
body
the
mind
that
is
the
rule
throughout
creation
they
examined
not
his
reason
but
his
leg
julia
stood
by
with
clasped
hands
and
a
face
beaming
with
pity
and
anxiety
that
repaid
his
pain
sampson
announced
there
were
no
bones
broken
but
a
bad
sprain
and
the
limb
very
red
and
swollen
now
inquired
he
briskly
of
the
company
what
is
the
practice
in
sprains
why
leeches
and
cold
edward
offered
at
once
to
run
and
get
them
are
you
mad
was
the
reply
dau
i
tell
ye
that
is
the
and
is
the
practice
sure
to
be
th
opposite
of
the
remedy
so
get
water
as
hot
as
he
can
bear
it
and
no
julia
remonstrated
angrily
is
this
a
case
for
jesting
deevil
a
jest
in
it
replied
the
doctor
then
if
ye
must
know
th
apply
hot
water
to
sprains
now
what
is
their
interest
t
expedite
the
cure
and
the
faculty
apply
cold
water
and
what
is
their
interest
to
procrastinate
the
cure
and
make
a
long
job
of
it
so
just
hold
your
toungues
and
ring
for
hot
julia
did
not
ring
she
beckoned
edward
and
they
flew
out
and
soon
brought
a
of
hot
water
edward
them
removed
alfred
shoes
and
stockings
and
julia
bared
her
lovely
arms
and
blushed
like
a
rose
alfred
divined
her
intention
dear
julia
he
said
i
wo
let
you
that
is
too
high
an
honour
sarah
can
do
but
julia
blood
was
up
sarah
said
she
contemptuously
she
is
too
heavy
handed
and
hold
your
tongue
i
do
take
my
orders
from
you
then
more
humbly
to
the
doctor
i
am
a
district
visitor
i
nurse
all
manner
of
strangers
and
he
says
i
must
leave
his
poor
suffering
leg
to
the
unnatural
young
monster
said
the
doctor
a
good
julia
followed
this
advice
by
handling
alfred
swollen
ankle
with
a
tenderness
so
exquisite
and
pressing
it
with
the
full
sponge
so
softly
that
her
divine
touch
soothed
him
as
much
or
more
than
the
water
after
nursing
him
into
the
skies
a
minute
or
two
she
looked
up
blushing
in
his
face
and
said
coaxingly
are
you
mad
dear
alfred
do
be
afraid
to
tell
us
the
truth
the
madder
you
are
the
more
you
need
me
to
take
care
of
you
you
alfred
smiled
at
this
sapient
discourse
and
said
he
was
not
the
least
mad
and
hoped
to
take
care
of
as
soon
as
his
ankle
was
well
enough
this
closed
that
sweet
mouth
of
hers
exceeding
tight
and
her
face
was
seen
no
more
for
a
while
but
hid
by
bending
earnestly
over
her
work
only
as
her
creamy
poll
turned
pink
the
colour
of
that
hidden
face
was
not
hard
to
divine
then
edward
asked
alfred
how
in
the
world
he
had
escaped
and
got
into
that
waggon
the
thing
was
incredible
mirawculous
said
sampson
in
assent
no
said
alfred
it
looks
stranger
to
you
than
it
is
the
moment
i
found
my
pistol
was
gone
i
determined
to
run
i
looked
down
and
saw
a
spout
with
a
great
ornamental
mouth
almost
big
enough
to
sit
on
and
while
i
was
looking
greedily
at
it
three
horses
came
into
the
yard
drawing
a
load
of
hay
the
waggoner
was
busy
clearing
the
pavement
with
his
wheel
and
the
waggon
almost
stopped
a
moment
right
under
me
there
was
a
lot
of
loose
hay
on
the
top
i
let
myself
down
and
hung
by
the
spout
a
moment
and
then
leaped
on
to
the
loose
hay
unfortunately
there
were
the
hard
trusses
beneath
it
and
so
i
got
my
sprain
oh
i
say
did
it
hurt
however
i
crept
under
the
hay
and
hid
myself
and
saw
wolf
men
come
into
the
yard
a
few
drops
of
rain
fell
and
some
fellows
chucked
down
a
tarpaulin
from
the
loft
and
nearly
smothered
me
so
i
cut
a
few
with
my
penknife
and
there
i
lay
heaven
knows
how
long
it
seemed
two
days
at
last
i
saw
an
angel
at
a
window
i
called
her
by
the
name
she
bears
on
earth
to
my
joy
she
answered
and
here
i
am
as
happy
as
a
prince
among
you
all
and
devilish
what
a
muff
i
was
not
to
think
of
that
said
edward
and
made
for
the
larder
dear
doctor
said
julia
lifting
a
face
with
swimming
eyes
i
see
no
change
in
him
he
is
very
brave
and
daring
and
saucy
but
so
he
always
was
to
be
sure
he
says
extravagant
things
and
stares
one
out
of
countenance
with
his
eyes
well
and
so
he
always
did
ever
since
knew
may
i
even
my
gratitude
whined
alfred
yes
but
you
need
not
stare
it
your
own
fault
miss
julee
said
sampson
with
you
fomenting
his
sprain
the
creature
fomenting
his
own
insensate
passion
break
every
bone
in
a
puppy
body
and
it
a
puppy
still
and
it
does
do
to
spoil
puppies
as
ye
spoiling
this
one
nlist
me
ye
vagabin
take
yonr
eyes
off
the
lady
and
look
in
the
face
if
ye
can
and
tell
me
how
you
came
to
leave
us
all
in
the
lurch
on
your
wedding
julia
fired
up
it
was
not
his
fault
poor
thing
he
was
decoyed
away
after
that
miserable
money
ah
you
may
laugh
at
me
for
hating
money
but
have
i
not
good
reason
to
hate
it
whist
whist
y
impetuous
cracter
and
let
him
tell
his
own
alfred
thus
invited
delivered
one
of
his
calm
luminous
statements
which
had
hitherto
been
listened
to
so
coldly
by
one
official
after
another
but
the
effect
was
mighty
different
falling
now
on
folk
not
paid
to
pity
as
for
sampson
he
bounced
up
very
early
in
the
narrative
and
went
striding
up
and
down
the
room
he
was
pale
with
indignation
and
his
voice
trembled
with
emotion
and
every
now
and
then
he
broke
in
on
the
narrative
with
oaths
and
curses
and
observations
of
this
kind
why
dinnt
ye
kill
um
i
have
killed
um
i
just
have
taken
the
first
knife
and
killed
um
man
our
liberty
is
our
life
dith
to
whoever
attacks
it
and
so
edward
coming
in
with
alfred
dinner
on
a
tray
found
the
maniac
delivering
his
wrongs
with
the
lofty
serenity
of
an
ancient
philosopher
discussing
the
wrongs
of
another
julia
crying
furtively
into
the
tub
and
the
good
physician
trampling
and
raving
about
the
room
like
what
the
stoical
narrator
was
accused
of
being
edward
stopped
and
looked
at
them
all
over
the
tray
well
said
he
if
there
a
madman
in
the
room
it
is
not
hardie
madman
ye
young
ijjit
roared
the
doctor
he
no
madder
than
i
heaven
forbid
said
alfred
drily
no
madder
than
are
ye
young
that
an
ungenerous
skit
on
edward
profession
objected
the
maniac
be
quite
now
chattering
said
the
excited
doctor
i
tell
ye
ye
niver
were
mad
and
niver
will
be
it
just
the
most
heartless
imposture
the
most
rascally
fraud
i
ever
caught
the
mad
ox
out
in
i
expose
it
gim
me
pninkpapr
man
they
take
y
again
if
we
do
mind
but
stop
that
these
ineequities
can
only
be
done
in
the
dark
i
shed
the
light
of
day
on
eat
your
dinner
and
hold
your
tongue
a
minute
if
ye
the
doctor
had
always
a
high
sense
of
volubility
he
went
to
work
and
soon
produced
a
letter
headed
private
in
this
he
related
pithily
alfred
incarceration
and
the
present
attempt
to
recapture
him
with
the
particulars
of
his
escape
that
will
interest
th
enemy
said
he
drily
he
vouched
for
alfred
sanity
at
both
dates
and
pledged
himself
to
swear
to
it
in
a
court
of
law
he
then
inquired
what
it
availed
to
have
sent
one
tyrant
to
phalaris
and
another
to
versailles
in
defence
of
our
liberty
since
after
all
that
liberty
lies
grovelling
at
the
mercy
of
and
sawbones
and
a
single
designing
relative
then
he
drew
a
strong
picture
of
this
british
citizen
skulking
and
hiding
at
this
moment
from
a
gang
of
rogues
and
conspirators
who
in
france
and
other
civilised
countries
that
brag
less
of
liberty
than
we
do
would
be
themselves
flying
as
criminals
from
the
officers
of
justice
and
he
wound
up
with
a
warm
appeal
to
the
press
to
cast
its
shield
over
the
victim
of
bad
laws
and
foul
practices
in
england
said
he
justice
is
the
daughter
of
publicity
throughout
the
world
deeds
of
villainy
are
done
every
day
in
kid
gloves
but
with
us
at
all
events
they
have
to
be
done
on
the
sly
here
lies
our
true
moral
eminence
as
a
nation
utter
then
your
lux
cast
the
full
light
of
publicity
on
this
dark
villainy
and
behold
it
will
wither
and
your
oppressed
and
injured
be
safe
from
that
very
he
signed
it
and
read
it
out
to
them
or
rather
roared
it
but
he
had
written
it
so
well
he
could
not
make
it
bad
by
delivery
indeed
he
was
a
masterly
writer
of
english
you
must
know
julia
was
delighted
but
alfred
shook
his
head
the
editor
will
not
put
it
th
editor
d
think
i
so
green
as
to
trust
t
any
one
editor
d
think
i
lived
all
these
years
and
not
learned
what
poor
cowardly
things
men
are
moral
courage
where
can
you
find
it
except
in
the
dickshinary
few
to
the
world
their
honest
thoughts
the
groveller
policy
robs
justice
and
none
but
sampson
dares
to
lift
a
hond
against
the
curst
corruption
of
the
lond
now
lad
i
off
to
my
printer
with
this
they
are
working
night
and
day
just
now
there
will
be
two
hundred
copies
printed
in
half
an
and
me
doctor
said
julia
am
poor
i
to
have
no
hand
in
it
how
cruel
of
you
oh
pray
pray
pray
let
me
help
a
put
on
your
bonnet
then
directly
said
he
in
war
never
lose
a
but
i
am
so
afraid
they
may
be
lying
in
wait
for
him
then
we
give
them
a
good
hiding
there
are
three
of
us
all
good
men
and
staunch
said
the
indomitable
doctor
no
no
said
the
pugnacious
alfred
julia
does
not
like
fighting
i
heard
her
screaming
all
the
time
i
was
defending
myself
on
the
stairs
let
us
be
prudent
let
us
throw
dust
in
their
eyes
put
me
on
a
bonnet
and
and
a
nice
little
woman
you
make
ye
oh
i
can
stoop
to
julia
welcomed
this
plan
almost
with
glee
and
she
and
edward
very
soon
made
a
handsome
trollop
six
feet
high
then
it
had
to
stoop
and
edward
and
julia
helped
it
out
to
the
carriage
under
the
very
noses
of
a
policeman
and
a
keeper
who
were
watching
for
alfred
seeing
which
oh
frailty
of
woman
the
district
visitor
addressed
it
aloud
as
her
aunt
and
begged
it
to
take
care
which
she
afterwards
observed
was
acting
a
falsehood
and
where
was
her
christianity
alfred
was
actually
not
recognised
the
carriage
bowled
away
to
the
great
printing
house
it
was
on
that
side
the
water
the
foreman
entered
into
the
thing
with
spirit
and
divided
the
copy
small
as
it
was
among
two
or
three
compositors
so
a
rough
proof
was
ready
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
doctor
corrected
it
and
soon
they
began
to
work
off
the
copies
the
foreman
found
them
mitchell
newspaper
list
and
envelopes
by
the
hundred
and
while
the
copies
were
pouring
in
all
hands
were
folding
and
addressing
them
to
the
london
and
provincial
editors
the
office
lent
the
stamps
the
doctor
drove
alfred
to
his
own
lodgings
and
forbade
him
to
reappear
in
pembroke
street
until
the
letter
should
come
out
in
the
london
journals
that
night
the
letters
were
all
posted
and
at
daybreak
were
flying
north
south
east
and
west
in
the
afternoon
the
letter
came
out
in
four
london
evening
papers
and
the
next
morning
the
metropolis
and
the
whole
kingdom
were
ringing
with
them
and
the
full
blaze
of
publicity
burst
upon
this
dark
deed
ay
stout
sampson
well
you
knew
mankind
and
well
you
knew
the
nation
you
lived
in
richard
hardie
in
the
very
act
of
setting
detectives
to
find
alfred
ran
his
nose
against
this
letter
in
the
he
collapsed
at
the
sight
of
it
and
wrote
directly
to
wolf
enclosing
it
and
saying
that
it
would
be
unadvisable
to
make
any
fresh
attempt
his
letter
was
crossed
by
one
from
wolf
containing
sampson
thunderbolt
extracted
from
the
and
saying
that
no
earthly
consideration
should
induce
him
to
meddle
with
alfred
richard
hardie
flung
himself
into
the
train
and
went
down
to
his
brother
at
clare
court
he
was
ill
at
ease
he
felt
like
some
great
general
who
has
launched
many
attacks
against
the
foe
very
successful
at
first
then
less
successful
then
repulsed
with
difficulty
then
repulsed
with
ease
till
at
last
the
foe
stands
before
him
impregnable
then
he
feels
that
ere
long
that
iron
enemy
will
attack
him
in
turn
and
that
he
exhausted
by
his
own
onslaughts
must
defend
himself
how
he
can
yet
there
was
a
pause
he
passed
a
whole
quiet
peaceful
day
with
his
brother
assuring
him
that
the
affair
would
go
no
further
on
either
side
but
in
his
secret
soul
he
felt
this
quiet
day
was
but
the
ominous
pause
between
two
great
battles
one
of
the
father
against
the
son
the
other
of
the
son
against
the
father
and
he
was
right
the
very
next
day
the
late
defender
attacked
and
in
earnest
but
for
certain
reasons
i
prefer
to
let
another
relate
it
dear
sir
if
you
had
been
in
my
office
when
i
received
your
favour
of
yesterday
relating
deft
assault
you
would
have
seen
the
most
ridiculous
sight
in
nature
videlicet
an
attorney
in
a
passion
i
threw
professional
courtesy
to
the
winds
and
sent
colls
off
to
clare
court
to
serve
the
writ
personally
next
day
he
found
the
deft
walking
in
his
garden
with
richard
hardie
having
learned
from
the
servant
which
was
his
man
he
stepped
up
and
served
copy
of
the
writ
in
the
usual
way
deft
turned
pale
and
his
knees
knocked
together
and
colls
thinks
he
mistook
himself
for
a
felon
and
was
going
to
ask
for
mercy
but
richard
stopped
him
and
said
his
attorneys
were
heathfield
in
chancery
lane
and
was
this
the
way
compton
did
business
serving
a
writ
personally
on
a
gentleman
in
weak
health
so
colls
who
can
sneer
in
his
quiet
way
told
him
but
the
invalid
had
declined
to
answer
my
letter
and
the
invalid
had
made
a
violent
attack
upon
our
client
person
avoiding
his
attorney
as
his
proceedings
are
summary
we
meet
him
in
kind
says
little
colls
says
richard
are
a
wit
are
you
come
and
have
some
luncheon
this
was
to
get
him
away
from
the
weaker
brother
i
take
it
he
gave
colls
an
excellent
luncheon
and
some
admirable
conversation
on
policy
and
finance
and
when
he
was
going
says
this
agreeable
host
you
have
had
your
bellyful
of
chicken
and
madeira
and
your
client
shall
have
his
bellyful
of
law
and
this
colls
considers
emphatic
but
i
am
yours
faithfully
john
colls
elicited
that
no
further
attempt
will
be
made
to
capture
you
it
seems
some
injudicious
friend
of
yours
has
been
writing
to
the
newspapers
pray
stop
on
receiving
this
letter
alfred
bought
another
double
pistol
loaded
it
hired
a
of
two
prizefighters
and
with
these
at
his
heels
repaired
to
pembroke
street
no
enemy
was
near
the
press
had
swept
the
street
alike
of
keepers
and
police
with
one
briarian
gesture
he
found
julia
and
edward
in
great
anxiety
about
their
father
the
immediate
cause
was
a
letter
from
dodd
which
edward
gave
him
to
read
but
not
till
he
had
first
congratulated
him
heartily
on
the
aegis
of
the
press
being
thrown
over
him
the
has
a
leader
on
it
said
he
dodd
letter
ran
thus
my
dear
dear
children
i
am
coming
home
to
you
heartbroken
without
your
poor
father
i
saw
an
east
indian
ship
go
to
sea
and
some
instinct
whispered
suppose
he
should
be
on
board
that
ship
but
foolishly
i
did
not
utter
my
thoughts
because
they
call
these
instincts
fancies
but
now
even
green
thinks
he
is
gone
to
sea
for
the
town
has
been
ransacked
and
no
trace
of
him
can
we
find
i
met
my
cousin
captain
bazalgette
here
and
he
is
promoted
to
the
frigate
and
sails
i
have
told
him
all
our
misfortunes
and
he
has
promised
to
overhaul
that
merchant
ship
if
he
comes
up
with
her
but
i
see
by
the
way
his
eye
shuns
he
has
no
real
hopes
his
ship
is
the
swifter
but
he
may
pass
her
in
the
night
and
then
he
is
bound
for
new
zealand
not
india
i
told
reginald
my
poor
husband
expression
of
face
is
altered
by
his
affliction
and
that
he
takes
himself
for
a
common
sailor
and
has
his
medal
still
round
his
neck
our
cousin
is
very
kind
and
will
do
all
he
can
god
can
protect
my
darling
at
sea
as
he
has
ashore
and
in
his
power
alone
have
i
any
trust
any
further
stay
here
is
vain
my
heart
too
yearns
for
my
other
treasures
and
dreads
lest
whilst
i
am
here
and
because
i
am
here
some
evil
should
befall
you
too
expect
me
soon
after
this
letter
and
let
us
try
and
comfort
one
another
under
this
the
heaviest
of
all
our
many
with
sad
heart
i
am
both
my
darlings
loving
mother
and
friend
lucy
dodd
in
the
discussion
of
this
letter
alfred
betrayed
a
slight
defect
of
character
he
the
calamity
said
david
had
now
a
chance
and
a
good
one
of
being
cured
whereas
confinement
was
one
of
the
common
causes
of
insanity
even
in
sane
persons
and
he
stoutly
maintained
that
david
going
to
sea
was
a
happy
inspiration
edward
coloured
but
deigned
no
reply
julia
was
less
patient
and
though
she
was
too
loving
and
too
womanly
to
tell
alfred
to
his
face
he
was
deceiving
himself
and
arguing
thus
indirectly
to
justify
himself
in
taking
her
father
out
of
the
asylum
at
all
yet
she
saw
it
and
it
imparted
a
certain
coldness
into
her
replies
alfred
noticed
this
and
became
less
confident
and
louder
and
prodigiously
logical
he
was
still
flowing
on
with
high
imperious
voice
which
i
suppose
overpowered
the
sound
of
dodd
foot
when
she
entered
suddenly
pale
and
weary
in
her
alfred
stopped
and
they
all
started
to
their
feet
at
sight
of
alfred
she
stood
dumbfoundered
a
single
moment
then
uttered
a
faint
shriek
and
looked
at
him
with
unutterable
terror
he
stood
disconcerted
julia
ran
and
throwing
her
arms
round
dodd
neck
entreated
her
not
to
be
afraid
of
him
he
was
not
mad
sampson
said
so
edward
confirmed
her
words
and
then
julia
poured
out
the
story
of
his
wrongs
with
great
gushes
of
natural
eloquence
that
might
have
melted
a
rock
and
as
anticlimax
is
part
of
a
true
woman
ended
innocently
by
begging
her
mother
not
to
look
so
unkindly
at
him
and
his
ankle
so
sprained
and
him
in
such
pain
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
dodd
was
deaf
to
her
daughter
natural
eloquence
it
was
remarkable
how
little
her
countenance
changed
while
julia
appealed
she
stood
looking
askant
with
horror
at
alfred
all
through
that
gentle
eloquent
appeal
but
nevertheless
her
conduct
showed
she
had
heard
every
word
as
soon
as
ever
her
daughter
voice
stopped
she
seemed
to
dilate
bodily
and
moved
towards
alfred
pale
and
lowering
yes
for
once
this
gentle
quiet
lady
looked
terrible
she
confronted
alfred
is
this
true
sir
said
she
in
a
low
stern
voice
are
you
not
insane
have
you
been
bereft
of
your
reason
no
dodd
i
have
then
what
have
you
done
with
my
husband
sir
chapter
xlvii
it
was
a
thunderbolt
alfred
hung
his
head
and
said
humbly
i
did
but
go
upstairs
for
one
moment
to
wash
my
hands
for
dinner
and
he
was
dodd
went
on
in
her
low
stern
voice
almost
as
if
he
had
not
answered
her
at
all
by
what
right
did
you
assume
the
charge
of
him
did
i
authorise
you
to
take
him
from
the
place
where
he
was
safe
and
under
my
eye
alfred
replied
sullenly
he
was
not
very
safe
for
he
was
almost
burnt
to
death
the
fire
liberated
him
not
i
after
the
fire
i
ran
away
from
him
he
followed
me
and
then
what
could
i
do
i
made
the
best
of
it
and
gave
up
my
own
desires
to
try
and
cure
him
he
longed
for
the
sea
i
tried
to
indulge
him
i
hoped
to
bring
him
back
to
you
sane
but
fate
was
against
me
i
am
the
most
unfortunate
of
mr
hardie
said
dodd
what
you
have
done
was
the
act
of
a
madman
and
if
i
believed
you
to
be
anything
but
a
madman
the
sight
of
you
would
be
intolerable
to
me
for
you
have
made
me
a
widow
and
my
children
with
this
she
gave
a
great
shudder
and
retired
in
tears
alfred
rose
pale
and
defiant
that
is
notion
of
justice
said
he
bitterly
pray
is
it
yours
you
two
well
since
you
ask
my
opinion
said
edward
i
think
it
was
rather
presumptuous
of
you
to
undertake
the
care
of
my
father
and
having
undertaken
it
you
ought
not
to
have
left
him
a
moment
out
of
your
oh
that
is
your
opinion
is
it
and
you
dear
julia
julia
made
no
reply
but
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sighed
deeply
i
see
said
alfred
sorrowfully
even
you
are
against
me
at
heart
you
judge
by
the
event
not
the
motive
there
is
no
justice
in
this
world
for
me
i
sick
of
life
i
have
no
right
to
keep
the
mistress
of
the
house
out
of
her
own
room
there
i
go
my
heart
is
broken
no
it
is
not
and
never
shall
be
by
anything
that
breathes
thank
heaven
i
have
got
one
friend
left
in
this
bitter
world
and
i
make
her
the
judge
whether
i
have
deserved
this
last
injustice
go
to
my
he
jumped
up
and
hobbled
slowly
across
the
room
while
julia
and
edward
sat
chilled
to
the
bone
by
those
five
little
words
so
simple
so
natural
yet
so
incredible
and
to
the
hearers
so
awful
they
started
they
shuddered
they
sat
petrified
staring
at
him
while
he
hobbled
across
the
room
to
go
to
his
sister
as
he
opened
the
door
to
go
out
he
heard
stout
edward
groan
and
julia
utter
a
low
wail
he
stood
confounded
a
moment
then
he
hobbled
down
a
stair
or
two
but
ere
he
had
gone
far
there
was
a
hasty
whispering
in
the
and
edward
came
after
him
in
great
agitation
and
begged
him
to
return
julia
must
speak
with
him
he
turned
and
his
face
brightened
edward
saw
that
and
turned
his
own
face
away
and
stammered
out
forget
what
i
said
to
you
i
am
your
friend
and
always
must
be
for
her
sake
no
no
i
can
not
go
into
that
room
with

brightened

in

middle
of

colour
of
ashes
alfred
was
alarmed

he
cried

i
done

my
ungoverned
temper

moved
towards

a
face
full
of
concern

she
solemnly

beside

my
poor
alfred
and
god

to
speak
to
him
alfred
began
to
feel
dire
misgivings
yes
said
she
i
love
you
too
well
to
let
any
hand
but
mine
wound
and
here
she
took
his
sinewy
hand
with
her
soft
palm
i
want
to
soften
it
in
the
telling
and
ah
how
can
i
oh
why
can
i
not
throw
myself
body
and
soul
between

my
julia
said
alfred
gravely
something
has
happened
to
yes
alfred
she
met
with
a
terrible
ah
she
was
struck
by
an
unfortunate
man
he
was
not
in
his
right
struck
my
sister
struck
what
was
there
no
man
by
no
edward
nearly
killed
him
god
bless
alfred
be
patient
it
was
too
what
is
she
hurt

she
disfigured
no
alfred
said
julia
solemnly
she
is
not
disfigured
oh
far
from
julia
you
alarm
me
this
comes
of
shutting
her
brother
up
may
heaven
eternal
curse
light
on
those
who
did
it
my
poor
little
sister
how
you
weep
julia
my
heart
is
i
weep
for
you
darling
not
for
ah
that
is
how
they
talk
when
those
we
love
are
one
word
i
shall
never
see
my
poor
little
jenny
again
shall
i
yes
alfred
if
you
will
but
follow
her
steps
and
believe
in
him
who
soothed
her
last
hour
and
made
her
face
shine
with
joy
like
an
while
we
all
wept
around
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
said
he
had
but
one
true
friend
in
the
world
alas
it
is
so
you
have
but
me
now
who
pity
you
and
love
you
more
than
heart
can
utter
my
own
my
beloved
my
what
could
soften
such
a
shock
as
this
it
fell
and
his
anguish
was
frightful
all
the
more
so
that
he
ascribed
the
calamity
to
his
imprisonment
and
mingled
curses
and
threats
of
vengeance
with
his
bursts
of
grief
he
spurned
the
consolations
of
religion
he
said
heaven
was
as
unjust
as
earth
as
cruel
as
hell
she
cried
out
and
stopped
his
mouth
with
her
hand
she
almost
forced
him
to
kneel
beside
her
and
prayed
aloud
for
him
and
when
at
last
his
agony
found
vent
in
tears
she
put
her
innocent
arms
round
his
neck
and
wept
with
him
every
now
and
then
the
poor
fellow
would
almost
shriek
with
remorse
oh
if
i
had
only
been
kinder
to
her
if
i
had
but
been
kinder
to
her
you
were
kind
to
her
said
julia
softly
but
firmly
oh
no
i
was
always
sneering
at
her
and
why
i
knew
her
religion
was
sincere
but
my
little
mind
fixed
on
a
few
phrases
she
had
picked
up
from
others
and
i
he
could
say
no
more
but
groaned
with
anguish
and
let
his
remorse
be
a
caution
to
us
all
bereaved
we
all
must
be
who
live
on
and
on
but
bereavement
bitterest
drop
we
may
avoid
alfred
said
julia
do
not
torment
yourself
we
girls
care
little
about
a
few
sarcasms
it
is
the
cold
heart
that
wounds
us
you
loved
jane
and
she
knew
it
well
and
joyed
in
it
you
were
kinder
to
her
than
you
think
and
so
her
dying
thoughts
were
for
you
it
was
for
you
she
asked
and
made
your
father
send
for
you
and
poor
i
hoped
you
would
come
and
dearest
her
last
act
was
to
write
a
few
words
to
you
and
trust
them
to
her
who
she
knew
loved
you
better
than
heart
can
utter
since
it
was
her
wish
let
us
try
and
read
them
together
the
last
words
of
a
saint
i
have
never
seen
them
and
if
they
do
not
prove
words
of
love
then
i
will
let
you
think
you
were
not
a
good
brother
to
her
you
and
i
and
poor
poor
edward
have
he
made
a
sad
sign
of
assent
and
julia
rose
and
got
the
enclosure
but
as
jane
last
written
words
reappeared
on
the
scene
in
a
somewhat
remarkable
way
i
will
only
say
here
that
both
these
poor
young
things
tried
in
vain
to
read
them
and
both
in
turn
burst
out
sobbing
so
that
they
could
not
so
they
held
the
paper
and
tried
to
see
the
words
out
of
their
streaming
eyes
and
these
two
mourners
had
the
room
to
themselves
till
midnight
for
even
dodd
hostility
respected
alfred
then
and
as
for
julia
she
was
one
of
those
who
rise
with
the
occasion
she
was
half
wife
half
angel
from
heaven
to
her
bereaved
lover
through
all
those
bitter
hours
chapter
xlviii
no
life
was
ever
yet
a
play
i
mean
an
unbroken
sequence
of
dramatic
incidents
calms
will
come
unfortunately
for
the
readers
happily
for
the
read
and
i
remember
seeing
it
objected
to
novelists
by
a
young
gentleman
just
putting
his
foot
for
the
first
time
into
criticism
that
the
writers
aforesaid
suppress
the
small
intermediate
matters
which
in
real
life
come
by
the
score
between
each
brilliant
event
and
so
present
the
ordinary
and
the
extraordinary
parts
of
life
in
false
proportions
now
if
this
remark
had
been
offered
by
way
of
contrast
between
events
themselves
and
all
mortal
attempts
to
reproduce
them
upon
paper
or
the
stage
it
would
have
been
philosophical
but
it
was
a
strange
error
to
denounce
the
practice
as
distinctive
of
fiction
for
it
happens
to
be
the
one
trait
the
novelist
and
dramatist
have
in
common
with
the
evangelist
the
gospels
skip
fifteen
years
of
the
most
interesting
life
creation
has
witnessed
they
relate
christ
birth
in
full
but
hurry
from
his
boyhood
to
the
more
stirring
events
of
his
thirtieth
and
subsequent
years
and
all
the
inspired
histories
do
much
the
same
thing
the
truth
is
that
epics
dramas
novels
histories
chronicles
reports
of
trials
at
law
in
a
word
all
narratives
true
or
fictitious
except
those
which
true
or
fictitious
nobody
reads
abridge
the
uninteresting
facts
as
nature
never
did
and
dwell
as
nature
never
did
on
the
interesting
ones
can
nothing
however
be
done
to
restore
in
the
reader
judgment
that
just
balance
of
the
sensational
and
the
soporific
which
all
writers
that
have
readers
disturb
nothing
i
think
without
his
own
assistance
but
surely
something
with
it
and
therefore
i
throw
myself
on
the
intelligence
of
my
readers
and
ask
them
to
realise
that
henceforth
pages
are
no
strict
measure
of
time
and
that
to
a
year
big
with
strange
events
on
which
i
have
therefore
dilated
in
this
story
succeeded
a
year
in
which
few
brilliant
things
happened
to
the
personages
of
this
tale
in
short
a
year
to
be
skimmed
by
chronicler
or
novelist
and
yet
mind
you
a
year
of
three
hundred
and
days
six
hours
or
thereabouts
and
one
in
which
the
quiet
unobtrusive
troubles
of
our
friends
hearts
especially
the
female
hearts
their
doubts
divisions
distresses
did
not
remit
far
from
it
now
this
year
i
propose
to
divide
into
topics
and
go
by
logical
rather
than
natural
sequence
of
events
the
lovers
alfred
came
every
day
to
see
julia
and
dodd
invariably
left
the
room
at
his
knock
at
last
julia
proposed
to
alfred
not
to
come
to
the
house
for
the
present
but
to
accompany
her
on
her
rounds
as
district
visitor
to
see
and
soothe
the
bitter
calamities
of
the
poor
had
done
her
own
heart
good
in
its
worst
distress
and
she
desired
to
apply
the
same
medicine
to
her
beloved
who
needed
it
that
was
one
thing
and
then
another
was
that
she
found
her
own
anger
rising
when
her
mother
left
the
room
at
that
beloved
knock
and
to
be
angry
with
her
poor
widowed
mother
was
a
sin
she
is
as
unfortunate
as
i
am
happy
thought
julia
i
have
got
alfred
assented
to
this
arrangement
with
rather
an
ill
grace
he
misunderstood
julia
and
thought
she
was
sacrificing
him
to
what
he
called
her
mother
injustice
this
indeed
was
the
interpretation
any
male
would
have
been
pretty
sure
to
put
on
it
his
soreness
however
did
not
go
very
far
because
she
was
so
kind
and
good
to
him
when
they
were
together
he
used
to
escort
her
back
to
the
door
of
and
look
imploringly
but
she
never
asked
him
in
he
thought
her
hard
for
this
he
did
not
see
the
tears
that
flowed
for
that
mute
look
of
his
the
moment
the
door
was
closed
tears
she
innocently
restrained
for
fear
the
sight
of
them
should
make
him
as
unhappy
as
his
imploring
look
made
her
calcul
she
should
have
cried
right
out
when
we
men
are
unhappy
we
like
our
sweethearts
to
be
unhappier
that
consoles
but
when
this
had
gone
on
nearly
a
month
and
no
change
alfred
lost
patience
so
he
lingered
one
day
at
the
door
to
make
a
request
he
asked
julia
to
marry
him
and
so
put
an
end
to
this
state
of
things
marry
you
child
cried
julia
blushing
like
a
rose
with
surprise
and
pleasure
oh
for
shame
after
the
first
thrill
she
appealed
to
his
candour
whether
that
would
not
be
miserably
selfish
of
her
to
leave
her
poor
mother
in
her
present
distressed
condition
ah
alfred
pale
spiritless
and
inconsolable
my
poor
poor
mother
you
will
have
to
decide
between
us
two
one
heaven
forbid
said
julia
turning
pale
at
the
very
idea
but
he
repeated
doggedly
that
it
must
come
to
that
sooner
or
later
then
he
reminded
her
of
their
solemn
engagement
and
put
it
to
her
whether
it
was
a
moral
proceeding
in
her
to
go
back
from
her
plighted
troth
what
had
he
done
to
justify
her
in
drawing
back
from
her
word
i
admit
said
he
that
i
have
plenty
of
wrong
for
your
sake
but
what
have
i
done
wrong
undeterred
by
the
fear
of
immorality
the
monotonous
girl
had
but
one
reply
to
his
multiform
reasons
this
is
no
time
for
me
to
abandon
my
ah
it
is
her
you
love
you
do
care
for
me
snapped
alfred
do
i
dear
alfred
murmured
julia
forgive
me
i
a
ruffian
a
you
are
my
alfred
but
oh
have
a
little
patience
a
little
patience
i
have
the
patience
of
job
but
even
his
went
at
i
ought
to
have
said
they
were
in
the
passage
now
the
encroaching
youth
had
gained
an
entrance
by
agitating
her
so
at
the
door
that
she
had
to
ask
him
in
to
hide
her
own
blushes
from
the
public
she
now
gently
reminded
him
how
much
happier
they
were
than
they
had
been
for
months
dear
me
said
she
i
am
almost
happy
happier
than
i
ought
to
be
could
be
quite
so
but
that
i
see
you
ah
you
have
so
many
about
you
that
you
love
i
have
only
and
that
is
true
my
poor
this
softened
him
a
little
and
then
she
interwove
her
fingers
together
and
so
put
both
palms
softly
on
his
shoulder
you
never
saw
a
male
do
that
and
never
will
and
implored
him
to
be
patient
to
be
generous
oh
said
she
if
you
knew
the
distress
it
gives
me
to
refuse
to
you
anything
on
earth
you
would
be
generous
and
not
press
me
when
my
heart
says
but
my
lips
say
this
melted
him
altogether
and
he
said
he
would
not
torment
her
any
more
but
he
went
away
discontented
with
himself
for
having
yielded
my
lord
did
not
call
it
yielding
but
being
and
as
he
was
not
only
very
deep
in
love
but
by
nature
combative
he
took
a
lodging
nearly
opposite
no
and
made
hot
love
to
her
as
hot
as
if
the
attachment
was
just
forming
her
mother
could
not
go
out
but
he
was
at
the
door
directly
she
could
not
go
out
but
he
was
at
her
heels
this
pleased
her
at
first
and
thrilled
her
with
the
sense
of
sweet
and
hot
pursuit
but
situated
as
she
was
between
him
and
her
mother
it
worried
her
a
little
at
times
and
made
her
nervous
she
spoke
a
little
sharply
to
him
now
and
then
and
that
was
new
it
came
from
the
nerves
not
the
heart
at
last
she
advised
him
to
go
back
to
oxford
i
shall
be
the
ruin
of
your
mind
if
we
go
on
like
this
said
she
sadly
what
leave
the
field
to
my
rivals
no
thank
what
rivals
sir
asked
julia
drawing
up
your
mother
your
brother
your
curates
that
would
come
buzzing
the
moment
i
left
your
sick
people
who
bask
on
your
smiles
and
your
sweet
voice
till
i
envy
them
sarah
whom
you
permit
to
brush
your
lovely
hair
the
piano
you
play
on
the
air
you
deign
to
breathe
and
brighten
everybody
and
everything
that
is
near
you
they
are
all
my
rivals
and
shall
i
resign
you
to
them
and
leave
myself
desolate
i
not
such
a
she
smiled
and
could
not
help
feeling
it
was
sweet
to
be
pestered
so
she
said
with
matronly
dignity
and
the
old
julian
consistency
you
are
a
foolish
impetuous
boy
you
are
the
plague
of
my
life
and
the
sun
of
my
that
passed
off
charmingly
but
presently
his
evil
genius
prompted
alfred
to
endeavour
to
soften
dodd
by
letter
and
induce
her
to
consent
to
his
marriage
with
her
daughter
he
received
her
answer
at
it
was
wonderfully
polite
and
cold
dodd
feigned
unmixed
surprise
at
the
proposal
and
said
that
insanity
being
unfortunately
in
her
own
family
and
the
suspicion
of
insanity
resting
on
himself
such
a
union
was
not
to
be
thought
of
and
therefore
notwithstanding
her
respect
for
his
many
good
qualities
she
must
decline
with
thanks
the
honour
he
offered
her
she
inserted
a
poisoned
sting
by
way
of
postscript
when
you
succeed
in
publicly
removing
the
impression
your
own
relations
share
with
me
and
when
my
husband
owes
his
restoration
to
you
instead
of
his
destruction
of
course
you
will
receive
a
very
different
answer
to
your
proposal
should
you
then
think
it
consistent
with
your
dignity
to
renew
as
hostile
testators
used
to
leave
the
disinherited
one
shilling
not
out
of
a
shilling
worth
of
kindly
feeling
but
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
say
his
name
was
omitted
through
inadvertency
so
dodd
inserted
this
postscript
merely
to
clench
the
nail
and
tantalise
her
enemy
it
was
a
masterpiece
of
feminine
spite
she
would
have
been
wonderstruck
could
she
have
seen
how
alfred
received
her
missive
to
be
sure
he
sat
in
a
cold
stupor
of
dejection
for
a
good
half
hour
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
said
quietly
so
be
it
i
get
the
trial
over
and
my
sanity
established
as
soon
as
possible
and
then
i
hire
a
yacht
and
hunt
her
husband
till
i
find
having
settled
this
little
plan
he
looked
out
for
julia
whose
sympathy
he
felt
in
need
of
after
such
a
stern
blow
she
came
out
much
later
than
usual
that
day
for
to
tell
the
truth
her
mother
had
detained
her
to
show
her
alfred
letter
and
her
answer
ah
mamma
said
poor
julia
you
do
love
me
as
you
did
once
poor
alfred
dodd
sighed
at
this
reproach
but
said
she
did
not
deserve
it
no
mother
in
her
senses
would
consent
to
such
a
match
julia
bowed
her
head
submissively
and
went
to
her
duties
but
when
alfred
came
to
her
to
complain
of
her
mother
cruelty
she
stopped
him
at
once
and
asked
him
how
he
could
go
and
write
that
foolish
unreasonable
letter
why
had
he
not
consulted
her
first
you
have
subjected
yourself
to
a
rebuff
said
she
angrily
and
one
from
which
i
should
have
saved
you
is
it
nothing
that
mamma
out
of
pity
to
me
connives
at
our
meeting
and
spending
hours
together
do
you
think
she
does
no
violence
to
her
own
wishes
here
and
is
she
to
meet
with
no
return
what
are
you
against
me
too
said
poor
alfred
no
it
is
you
who
are
our
enemy
with
your
unreasonable
i
am
not
so
as
you
are
humility
and
penitence
would
become
you
better
than
to
retort
on
me
i
love
you
both
and
pray
god
on
my
knees
to
show
me
how
to
do
my
duty
to
that
is
it
you
are
not
like
me
you
want
to
please
all
the
world
and
reconcile
the
irreconcilable
it
wo
do
you
will
have
to
choose
between
your
mother
and
me
at
then
of
course
i
shall
choose
my
why
because
she
claims
my
duty
as
well
as
my
love
because
she
is
bowed
down
with
sorrow
and
needs
her
daughter
just
now
more
than
you
do
besides
you
are
my
other
self
and
we
must
deny
we
have
no
more
right
to
be
unjust
to
ourselves
than
to
anybody
else
injustice
is
alfred
you
are
a
heathen
and
talk
morality
morality
is
a
snare
what
i
pray
to
be
is
a
christian
as
your
dear
sister
was
and
to
deny
myself
and
you
make
it
oh
so
so
i
suppose
it
will
end
in
turning
out
your
heathen
and
then
taking
your
curate
your
mother
would
consent
to
that
alfred
said
julia
with
dignity
these
words
are
harsh
and
forgive
me
for
saying
so
they
are
coarse
such
words
would
separate
us
two
without
my
mother
if
i
were
to
hear
many
of
them
for
they
take
the
bloom
off
affection
and
that
mutual
reverence
without
which
no
gentleman
and
lady
could
be
blessed
in
holy
alfred
was
staggered
and
mortified
too
they
walked
on
in
silence
now
alfred
said
julia
at
last
do
not
think
me
behind
you
in
affection
but
wiser
for
once
and
our
best
friend
i
do
think
we
had
better
see
less
of
one
another
for
a
time
my
poor
and
why
for
a
time
why
not
for
ever
if
your
heart
draws
no
distinction
why
not
indeed
so
be
it
then
for
i
will
be
no
woman
slave
there
my
hand
julia
let
us
part
thank
you
for
that
dear
alfred
may
you
find
some
one
who
can
love
you
more
than
i
the
words
choked
her
but
he
was
stronger
because
he
was
in
a
passion
he
reproached
her
bitterly
if
i
had
been
as
weak
and
inconstant
as
you
are
i
might
have
been
out
of
drayton
house
long
before
i
did
escape
but
i
was
faithful
to
my
one
love
i
have
some
right
to
sing
aroon
you
have
none
you
are
an
angel
of
beauty
and
goodness
you
will
go
to
heaven
and
i
shall
go
to
the
devil
now
for
want
of
you
but
then
you
have
no
constancy
nor
true
fidelity
so
that
has
parted
us
and
now
nothing
is
left
me
but
to
try
and
hate
he
turned
furiously
on
his
heel
god
bless
you
go
where
you
will
faltered
julia
he
replied
with
a
fierce
ejaculation
of
despair
and
dashed
away
thus
temper
and
misunderstanding
triumphed
after
so
many
strange
and
bitter
trials
had
failed
but
alas
it
is
often
so
chapter
xlix
both
the
parted
lovers
were
wretched
julia
never
complained
but
drooped
and
read
the
psalms
and
edward
detected
her
in
tears
over
them
he
questioned
her
and
obtained
a
lame
account
she
being
far
more
bent
on
screening
alfred
than
on
telling
the
truth
edward
called
on
the
other
and
found
him
disconsolate
and
reading
a
heathen
philosopher
for
comfort
and
finding
none
edward
questioned
him
and
he
was
reserved
and
even
sulky
sir
imperturbable
persisted
quietly
and
he
exploded
and
out
came
his
wrongs
edward
replied
that
he
was
a
pretty
fellow
wanted
it
all
his
own
way
suppose
my
mother
with
her
present
feelings
was
to
take
a
leaf
out
of
your
book
and
use
all
her
power
where
would
you
be
then
come
old
fellow
i
know
what
love
is
and
one
of
us
have
the
girl
he
loves
unless
any
harm
should
come
to
my
poor
father
owing
to
your
blunder
oh
that
would
put
it
out
of
the
question
i
feel
but
let
us
hope
better
i
pulled
you
out
of
the
fire
and
somehow
i
seem
to
like
you
better
than
ever
after
that
let
me
pull
you
out
of
this
mess
pull
away
cried
the
impetuous
youth
i
trust
you
with
my
life
ay
with
more
than
my
life
with
my
love
for
you
are
the
man
for
me
reason
is
always
uppermost
with
you
give
me
the
man
that
is
not
passion
slave
and
i
will
wear
him
in
my
heart
core
ay
oh
bother
that
if
you
are
in
earnest
do
mouth
but
put
on
your
hat
and
come
he
assented
but
in
the
middle
of
putting
on
his
coat
made
this
little
observation
now
i
see
how
wise
the
ancients
were
yes
friendship
is
better
than
love
calmer
more
constant
free
from
the
heats
and
chills
of
that
impetuous
passion
its
pure
bosom
is
ruffled
by
none
of
jealousies
and
irritabilities
solem
e
mundo
tollunt
qui
tollunt
oh
bother
quoting
come
and
shake
hands
with
they
went
over
dodd
was
in
the
city
edward
ushered
in
alfred
saying
here
is
the
other
impetuosity
and
sagely
retired
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
came
back
they
were
sitting
hand
in
hand
he
gazing
on
her
she
inspecting
the
carpet
that
is
all
right
said
edward
drily
now
the
next
thing
is
you
must
go
back
to
oxford
directly
and
read
for
your
first
the
proposal
fell
like
a
blight
upon
the
reconciled
lovers
but
edward
gave
potent
reasons
the
delays
of
law
were
endless
alfred
defendant
had
already
obtained
one
postponement
of
the
trial
on
frivolous
grounds
now
the
oxford
examination
and
doncaster
races
come
on
at
a
fixed
date
by
a
law
of
nature
and
admit
of
no
postponement
you
mark
my
words
you
will
get
your
class
before
you
will
get
your
trial
and
it
wo
hurt
you
to
go
into
court
a
man
will
it
and
then
you
wo
quarrel
by
letter
you
two
i
know
come
will
you
do
what
i
tell
you
or
is
friendship
but
a
name
eh
bombast
he
ended
with
great
though
quiet
force
come
you
two
which
is
better
to
part
like
the
scissors
or
part
like
the
thread
similes
are
no
arguments
that
is
why
they
convince
people
so
alfred
capitulated
to
the
scissors
and
thread
and
only
asked
with
abnormal
humility
to
be
allowed
to
taste
the
joys
of
reconciliation
for
two
days
the
third
found
him
at
oxford
he
called
on
the
head
of
his
college
to
explain
what
had
prevented
his
return
to
exeter
in
the
october
term
twelve
months
ago
and
asked
for
rooms
instead
of
siding
with
a
man
of
his
own
college
so
cruelly
injured
the
dignitary
was
alarmed
by
the
bare
accusation
and
said
he
must
consider
insanity
was
a
terrible
thing
so
is
false
accusation
and
so
is
false
imprisonment
said
hardie
bitterly
unquestionably
but
i
have
at
present
no
means
of
deciding
how
far
those
words
in
short
he
could
give
no
answer
must
consult
the
other
officers
and
would
convey
the
result
by
letter
alfred
pride
was
deeply
mortified
not
less
by
a
certain
cold
repugnant
manner
than
by
the
words
and
there
came
over
his
heart
a
sickening
feeling
that
he
was
now
in
the
eyes
of
men
an
intellectual
leper
he
went
to
another
college
directly
and
applied
to
the
the
sent
him
with
a
letter
to
the
dean
the
dean
looked
frightened
and
told
him
hesitatingly
the
college
was
full
he
might
put
his
name
down
and
perhaps
get
in
next
year
alfred
retired
and
learned
from
the
porter
that
the
college
was
not
full
he
sighed
deeply
and
the
sickening
feeling
grew
on
him
an
ineradicable
stigma
seemed
upon
him
and
dodd
was
no
worse
than
the
rest
of
the
world
then
every
mother
in
england
would
approve
her
resolutions
he
wandered
about
the
scenes
of
his
intellectual
triumphs
he
stood
in
the
great
square
of
the
schools
a
place
ugly
to
unprejudiced
eyes
but
withal
somewhat
grand
and
inspiring
especially
to
scholars
who
have
fought
their
keen
and
bloodless
battles
there
he
looked
at
the
windows
and
gilt
inscription
of
the
schola
metaphysices
in
which
he
had
met
the
scholars
of
his
day
and
defeated
them
for
the
ireland
he
wandered
into
the
theatre
and
eyed
the
rostrum
whence
he
had
not
mumbled
but
recited
his
latin
prize
poem
with
more
than
one
thunder
of
academic
applause
thunder
compared
with
which
drury
lane
us
a
mere
cracker
these
places
were
unchanged
but
he
sad
scholar
wandered
among
them
as
if
he
was
a
ghost
and
all
these
were
stony
phantoms
of
an
intellectual
past
never
never
to
return
he
telegraphed
sampson
and
edward
to
furnish
him
with
certificates
that
he
had
never
been
insane
but
the
victim
of
a
foul
conspiracy
and
when
he
received
them
he
went
with
them
to
margaret
hall
for
he
had
bethought
him
that
the
new
principal
was
a
man
and
had
openly
vowed
he
would
raise
that
refuge
for
the
phoughed
to
a
place
of
learning
hardie
called
sent
in
his
card
and
was
admitted
to
the
study
he
was
about
to
explain
who
he
was
when
the
doctor
interrupted
him
and
told
him
politely
he
knew
him
by
reputation
tell
me
rather
said
he
shrewdly
to
what
i
owe
this
application
from
an
undergraduate
so
distinguished
as
hardie
then
alfred
began
to
quake
and
instead
of
replying
put
a
hand
suddenly
before
his
face
and
lost
courage
for
one
moment
come
hardie
said
the
principal
do
be
disconcerted
a
fault
regretted
is
half
atoned
and
i
am
not
disposed
to
be
hard
on
the
errors
of
youth
i
mean
where
there
is
merit
to
balance
sir
said
alfred
sadly
it
is
not
a
fault
i
have
to
acknowledge
but
a
tell
me
all
about
it
said
alder
guardedly
he
told
it
omitting
nothing
essential
that
could
touch
the
heart
or
excite
the
ironical
humour
of
an
academician
well
is
more
wonderful
than
fiction
said
the
doctor
and
i
conclude
the
readers
of
this
tale
are
all
of
the
doctor
opinion
so
sweet
to
the
mind
is
cant
alfred
offered
his
certificates
now
alder
had
been
asking
himself
in
what
phrases
he
should
decline
this
young
genius
who
was
sane
now
but
of
course
had
been
mad
only
had
forgotten
the
circumstance
but
the
temptation
to
get
an
ireland
scholar
into
his
hall
suddenly
overpowered
him
the
probability
that
he
might
get
a
in
a
lucid
interval
was
too
enticing
nothing
venture
nothing
have
he
determined
to
venture
a
good
deal
mr
hardie
said
he
this
house
shall
always
be
open
to
good
morals
and
good
scholarship
while
i
preside
over
it
and
it
shall
be
open
to
them
all
the
more
when
they
come
to
me
dignified
and
made
sacred
by
calamity
now
this
fine
speech
like
minerva
herself
came
from
the
head
alfred
was
overcome
by
it
to
tears
at
that
the
doctor
heart
was
touched
and
even
began
to
fancy
it
had
originated
that
noble
speech
it
was
no
use
doing
things
by
halves
so
alder
gave
alfred
a
delightful
set
of
rooms
and
made
the
hall
pleasant
to
him
he
was
rewarded
by
a
growing
conviction
that
he
had
made
an
excellent
acquisition
this
opinion
however
was
anything
but
universal
and
alfred
finding
the
men
of
his
own
college
suspected
his
sanity
and
passed
jokes
behind
his
back
cut
them
all
dead
and
confined
himself
to
his
little
hall
there
they
petted
him
and
crowed
about
him
and
betted
on
him
for
the
schools
as
freely
as
if
he
was
a
colt
the
hall
was
going
to
enter
for
the
derby
he
read
hard
and
judiciously
but
without
his
old
confidence
he
became
anxious
and
doubtful
he
had
seen
so
many
men
just
miss
a
the
brilliant
creature
analysed
all
his
aristotelian
treatises
and
wrote
the
synopses
clear
with
marginal
references
on
great
pasteboard
cards
three
feet
by
two
and
so
kept
the
whole
subject
before
his
eye
till
he
obtained
a
singular
mastery
same
system
with
the
historians
nor
did
he
disdain
the
use
of
coloured
inks
then
the
brilliant
creature
drew
lists
of
all
the
hard
words
he
encountered
in
his
reading
especially
in
the
common
books
and
read
these
lists
till
mastered
the
stake
was
singularly
heavy
in
his
case
so
he
guarded
every
crevice
and
at
this
period
he
was
not
so
unhappy
as
he
expected
the
laborious
days
went
swiftly
and
twice
a
week
at
least
came
a
letter
from
julia
oh
how
his
grave
academic
room
with
oaken
panels
did
brighten
when
her
letter
lay
on
the
table
it
was
opened
and
seemed
written
with
sunbeams
no
quarrels
on
paper
absence
made
the
heart
grow
fonder
and
edward
came
to
see
him
and
over
their
wine
let
out
a
feminine
trait
in
julia
when
hurd
calls
she
walks
out
of
the
room
just
as
my
poor
mother
does
when
you
come
that
is
spite
since
you
are
sent
away
nobody
else
is
to
profit
by
it
where
is
her
christianity
eh
and
echo
answers
got
a
cigar
old
fellow
and
after
puffing
in
silence
awhile
he
said
resignedly
i
am
an
unnatural
oh
are
you
said
the
other
serenely
for
he
was
also
under
the
benign
influence
yes
said
edward
i
am
your
ally
and
a
mere
spy
in
the
camp
of
those
two
ladies
i
watch
all
their
moves
for
your
alfred
forgave
him
and
thus
his
whole
life
was
changed
and
for
nearly
twelve
months
for
alder
let
him
reside
in
the
hall
through
the
vacation
he
pursued
the
quiet
tenor
of
a
student
life
interrupted
at
times
by
law
but
that
is
another
topic
wife
and
no
wife
dodd
was
visibly
shaken
by
that
calamity
which
made
her
shrink
with
horror
from
the
sight
of
alfred
hardie
in
the
winter
she
was
so
unwell
that
she
gave
up
her
duties
with
cross
and
co
her
connection
with
them
had
been
creditable
to
both
parties
i
believe
i
forgot
to
say
why
they
trusted
her
so
well
i
must
tell
it
elsewhere
david
off
her
hands
she
was
independent
and
had
lost
the
motive
and
the
heart
for
severe
work
she
told
the
partners
she
could
no
longer
do
them
justice
and
left
them
to
their
regret
they
then
advised
her
to
set
up
as
a
milliner
and
offered
her
credit
for
goods
at
cash
prices
up
to
two
thousand
pounds
she
thanked
them
like
a
sorrowful
queen
and
went
her
way
in
the
spring
she
recovered
some
spirit
and
health
but
at
midsummer
a
great
and
subtle
misfortune
befell
her
her
mind
was
bent
on
david
night
and
day
and
used
to
struggle
to
evade
the
laws
of
space
that
bind
its
grosser
companion
and
find
her
lost
husband
on
the
sea
she
often
dreamt
of
him
but
vaguely
but
one
fatal
night
she
had
a
dream
as
clear
as
daylight
and
sharp
as
white
pebbles
in
the
sun
she
was
on
a
large
ship
with
guns
she
saw
men
bring
a
dead
sailor
up
the
side
she
saw
all
their
faces
and
the
dead
man
too
it
was
david
his
face
was
white
a
clear
voice
said
he
was
to
be
buried
in
the
deep
next
morning
she
saw
the
deck
at
her
feet
the
breeches
of
the
guns
so
clear
so
defined
that
when
she
awoke
and
found
herself
in
the
dark
she
thought
reality
was
the
illusion
she
told
the
dream
to
julia
and
edward
they
tried
to
encourage
her
in
vain
i
saw
him
she
said
i
saw
him
it
was
a
vision
not
a
dream
my
david
is
dead
well
then
i
shall
not
be
long
behind
sampson
ridiculed
her
dream
to
her
face
but
to
her
children
he
told
another
story
i
am
anxious
about
her
he
said
most
anxious
there
is
no
mortal
ill
the
distempered
brain
may
not
cause
is
it
not
devilish
we
can
hear
nothing
of
him
she
will
fret
herself
into
the
grave
as
sure
as
fate
if
something
does
not
turn
her
children
could
not
console
her
they
tried
but
something
hung
round
their
own
hearts
and
chilled
every
effort
in
a
word
they
shared
her
fears
how
came
she
to
see
him
on
board
a
ship
with
guns
in
her
waking
hours
she
always
said
he
was
on
a
merchant
ship
was
it
not
one
of
those
visions
which
come
to
mortals
and
give
them
sometimes
a
peep
into
space
and
far
more
rarely
a
glance
into
time
one
day
in
the
autumn
alfred
being
in
town
on
law
business
met
what
seemed
the
ghost
of
dodd
in
the
streets
she
saw
him
not
her
eye
was
on
that
ghastly
face
she
had
seen
in
her
dreams
it
flashed
through
his
mind
that
she
would
not
live
long
to
part
him
and
julia
but
he
discouraged
the
ungenerous
thought
almost
forgave
her
repugnance
to
himself
and
felt
it
would
be
worse
than
useless
to
ask
julia
to
leave
her
mother
who
was
leaving
her
visibly
but
her
horror
of
him
was
anything
but
softened
and
she
used
to
tell
sampson
she
thought
the
sight
of
that
man
would
kill
her
now
edward
himself
began
to
hope
alfred
would
turn
his
affections
elsewhere
the
house
in
pembroke
street
was
truly
the
house
of
mourning
now
all
their
calamities
were
light
compared
with
this
the
district
visitor
while
julia
was
writing
letters
to
keep
up
alfred
heart
she
was
very
sad
herself
moreover
he
had
left
her
for
oxford
but
a
very
few
days
when
she
received
an
anonymous
letter
her
first
it
was
written
in
a
female
hand
and
couched
in
friendly
and
sympathetic
terms
the
writer
thought
it
only
fair
to
warn
her
that
alfred
hardie
was
passionately
fond
of
a
lady
in
the
asylum
and
had
offered
her
marriage
if
miss
dodd
wished
to
be
deceived
let
her
burn
this
letter
and
think
no
more
of
it
if
not
let
her
insert
this
advertisement
in
the
times
the
whole
l
and
her
correspondent
would
communicate
particulars
by
word
or
writing
what
a
barbed
and
poisoned
arrow
is
to
the
body
was
this
letter
to
julia
mind
she
sat
cold
as
a
stone
with
this
poison
in
her
hand
then
came
an
impetuous
impulse
to
send
it
down
to
alfred
and
request
him
to
transfer
the
other
half
of
his
heart
to
his
lady
of
the
asylum
then
she
paused
and
remembered
how
much
unjust
suspicion
had
been
levelled
at
him
already
what
right
had
she
to
insult
him
she
would
try
and
keep
the
letter
to
herself
as
to
acting
upon
it
her
good
sense
speedily
suggested
it
came
from
the
rival
in
question
real
or
supposed
she
wants
to
make
use
of
me
said
julia
it
is
plain
alfred
does
not
care
much
for
her
or
why
does
she
come
to
me
she
put
the
letter
in
her
desk
and
it
rankled
in
her
heart
lateri
lethalis
she
trembled
at
herself
she
felt
a
savage
passion
had
been
touched
in
her
she
prayed
day
and
night
against
jealousy
but
i
must
now
to
justify
my
heading
skip
some
months
and
relate
a
remarkable
incident
that
befell
her
in
the
said
character
on
the
first
of
august
in
this
year
a
good
christian
woman
one
of
her
patients
asked
her
to
call
on
barkington
that
lodged
above
he
is
a
decent
body
miss
and
between
you
and
me
i
think
his
complaint
is
he
get
quite
enough
to
barkington
said
julia
and
put
her
hand
to
her
bosom
she
went
and
tapped
at
his
door
come
in
said
a
shrillish
voice
she
entered
and
found
a
weazened
old
man
seated
mending
his
own
coat
he
rose
and
she
told
him
she
was
a
district
visitor
he
said
he
had
heard
of
her
they
called
her
the
beautiful
lady
in
that
court
this
was
news
to
her
and
made
her
blush
she
asked
leave
to
read
a
chapter
to
him
he
listened
as
to
some
gentle
memory
of
childhood
she
prescribed
him
a
glass
of
port
wine
and
dispensed
it
on
the
instant
thus
physicked
her
patient
became
communicative
and
chattered
on
about
his
native
place
but
did
not
name
it
and
talked
about
the
people
there
now
our
district
visitor
was
if
the
truth
must
be
told
a
compounder
she
would
permit
her
pupils
to
talk
about
earthly
affairs
on
condition
they
would
listen
to
heavenly
ones
before
she
went
so
she
let
this
old
man
run
on
and
he
told
her
he
had
been
a
banker
clerk
all
his
life
and
saved
a
thousand
pounds
and
come
up
to
london
to
make
his
fortune
on
the
stock
exchange
and
there
he
was
sometimes
a
bull
and
sometimes
a
bear
and
whichever
he
was
certain
foxes
called
brokers
and
jobbers
got
the
profit
and
he
the
loss
it
all
the
same
as
a
said
he
the
jobbers
and
brokers
have
got
the
same
odds
the
bank
has
at
rouge
et
noir
and
the
little
capitalist
like
me
is
doomed
then
he
told
her
that
there
was
a
near
the
exchange
who
came
from
his
native
place
and
had
started
as
a
speculator
and
come
down
to
that
only
he
called
it
rising
and
used
to
speak
with
a
shudder
of
when
he
dabbled
in
the
funds
and
often
told
him
to
look
sharp
and
get
a
crossing
and
lo
one
day
when
he
was
cleaned
out
and
desperate
and
hovering
with
the
other
ghosts
of
little
capitalists
about
the
tomb
of
their
money
he
saw
his
countryman
fall
flat
and
the
broom
fly
out
of
his
hand
instantly
he
made
a
rush
and
so
did
a
sailor
but
he
got
first
to
the
broom
and
began
to
sweep
while
others
picked
up
his
countryman
who
proved
dead
as
a
herring
and
he
succeeded
to
his
broom
and
it
made
money
by
the
exchange
though
he
never
could
still
one
day
he
picked
up
a
in
that
neighbourhood
with
a
lump
of
money
which
he
straightway
advertised
in
no
newspapers
and
now
julia
thought
it
time
to
interpose
the
eighth
commandment
the
golden
rule
and
such
branches
of
learning
he
became
a
favourite
of
hers
he
had
so
much
to
say
she
even
thought
she
had
seen
his
face
before
but
she
could
not
tell
where
she
gave
him
good
books
and
tracts
and
read
to
him
and
ploughed
his
heart
with
her
sweet
voice
and
sowed
the
good
seed
in
the
furrows
seed
which
like
wheat
or
other
grain
often
seems
to
fall
flat
and
die
but
comes
out
green
after
many
days
one
saturday
she
invited
him
to
dine
with
the
servants
next
day
he
came
during
church
time
and
went
away
in
the
afternoon
while
she
was
with
her
mother
but
she
asked
sarah
who
proved
eager
to
talk
about
him
he
was
a
rum
customer
kept
asking
questions
all
dinner
time
says
i
good
company
you
are
be
you
a
lawyer
for
you
examines
us
but
you
do
tell
us
nothing
ye
see
miss
jane
she
is
that
simple
she
was
telling
him
everything
and
about
alfred
lawsuit
with
his
father
and
julia
said
that
was
indiscreet
but
after
all
what
did
it
matter
who
knows
miss
sarah
replied
least
said
is
soonest
mended
if
you
please
miss
who
is
he
where
does
he
bide
where
does
he
come
from
does
he
know
hardies
i
should
think
not
why
because
i
much
mistaken
if
he
then
putting
on
a
stolid
look
she
asked
does
he
know
your
papa
oh
no
sarah
how
should
he
there
now
said
sarah
miss
you
are
all
in
the
dark
about
this
old
man
i
tell
you
something
i
took
him
out
of
the
way
of
temper
when
she
began
a
dishing
up
and
i
had
him
into
the
parlour
for
a
minute
and
in
course
there
he
sees
the
picture
of
your
poor
papa
hung
up
miss
if
you
believe
me
the
moment
he
claps
eyes
on
that
there
picture
he
halloes
out
and
out
goes
his
two
hands
like
this
here
him
says
he
him
and
stares
at
the
picture
like
a
stuck
pig
forgot
i
was
close
behind
him
i
do
believe
daughter
says
he
in
a
whisper
a
curious
whisper
seemed
to
come
out
of
his
stomack
the
matter
now
says
i
just
so
he
gave
a
great
start
as
if
my
speaking
had
wakened
him
from
a
dream
and
says
he
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
is
much
says
i
just
so
used
to
be
anything
at
all
when
i
was
your
age
says
he
sneering
but
i
paid
him
a
good
coin
says
i
man
where
you
comes
from
do
the
folks
use
to
start
and
hallo
out
and
cry
it
him
his
daughter
and
fling
their
two
arms
abroad
like
a
wiumdmill
in
march
and
all
for
nothing
so
at
that
he
changed
as
white
as
my
smock
and
fell
all
of
a
tremble
however
at
dinner
he
perks
up
and
drew
that
poor
simple
jane
out
a
good
one
but
he
did
look
towards
me
much
which
i
set
opposite
to
watch
my
sarah
said
julia
this
is
really
curious
mysterious
you
are
a
good
watchful
faithful
girl
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
sometimes
fancy
i
have
seen
barkington
face
however
i
will
solve
this
little
mystery
for
i
will
ask
him
thank
you
on
monday
she
called
on
barkington
to
solve
the
mystery
but
instead
of
solving
her
visit
thickened
it
for
barkington
was
gone
bag
and
baggage
when
edward
was
told
of
this
business
he
thought
it
remarkable
and
regretted
he
had
not
seen
the
old
man
so
do
i
for
it
is
my
belief
edward
would
have
recognised
him
david
dodd
the
history
of
a
man
is
the
history
of
his
mind
and
that
is
why
you
have
heard
so
little
of
late
about
the
simplest
noblest
and
most
unfortunate
of
all
my
personages
insanity
is
as
various
as
eccentricity
i
have
spared
the
reader
some
of
vagaries
however
when
we
parted
with
him
he
had
settled
into
that
strange
phase
of
lunacy
in
which
the
distant
past
seems
nearly
obliterated
and
memory
exists
but
revolves
in
a
narrow
round
of
things
present
this
was
accompanied
with
a
positive
illusion
to
wit
a
fixed
idea
that
he
was
an
able
seaman
and
as
usual
what
mental
power
he
retained
came
out
strongest
in
support
of
this
idea
all
this
was
marked
by
a
bodily
agility
somewhat
more
than
natural
in
a
man
of
his
age
owing
to
the
wind
astern
he
was
enabled
to
run
into
portsmouth
before
the
came
up
with
him
and
he
did
run
into
port
not
because
he
feared
pursuit
but
because
he
was
desperately
hungry
and
he
had
no
suicidal
tendencies
whatever
he
made
for
a
and
called
for
some
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
they
were
supplied
and
then
lo
he
had
no
money
to
pay
for
them
i
owe
you
till
i
come
back
from
sea
my
bo
said
he
coolly
on
this
the
landlord
collared
him
and
david
shook
him
off
into
the
road
much
as
a
terrier
throws
a
rat
from
him
then
there
was
a
row
and
a
naval
officer
who
was
cruising
about
for
hands
came
up
and
heard
it
there
was
nothing
at
all
unseamanlike
in
david
conduct
and
the
gentleman
took
a
favourable
view
of
it
and
paid
the
small
demand
but
not
with
unleavened
motives
he
was
the
second
lieutenant
of
frigate
she
had
a
bad
name
thanks
to
her
last
captain
and
was
short
of
hands
he
took
david
aside
and
asked
him
would
he
like
to
ship
on
board
the
david
said
yes
and
suggested
the
foretop
oh
yes
growled
the
lieutenant
you
all
want
to
be
he
then
gauged
this
jacky
intellects
asked
him
how
to
send
a
frigate
foretop
gallant
yard
down
upon
deck
and
to
show
how
seamanship
sticks
in
the
brain
when
once
it
gets
there
david
actually
told
him
you
are
rather
old
said
the
lieutenant
but
you
are
a
seaman
and
so
took
him
on
board
the
at
spithead
before
green
began
to
search
the
town
in
earnest
nobody
acts
his
part
better
than
some
demented
persons
do
and
david
made
a
very
tolerable
sailor
notwithstanding
his
years
and
the
sea
did
him
good
within
certain
limits
between
him
and
the
past
lay
some
intellectual
or
cerebral
barrier
as
impenetrable
as
the
great
wall
of
china
but
on
the
hither
side
of
that
wall
his
faculties
improved
of
course
the
crew
soon
found
out
the
gap
in
his
poor
brain
and
called
him
soft
billy
and
played
on
him
at
first
but
by
degrees
he
won
their
affection
he
was
so
wonderfully
and
besides
his
mind
being
in
an
abnormal
state
he
loathed
grog
and
gave
his
allowance
to
his
messmates
one
day
he
showed
an
unexpected
trait
they
were
lying
becalmed
in
southern
latitudes
and
time
hanging
heavily
each
wiled
it
how
he
might
one
fiddled
another
wrote
to
his
polly
another
fished
for
sharks
another
whistled
for
a
wind
scores
fell
into
the
form
of
meditation
without
the
reality
and
one
got
a
piece
of
yarn
and
amused
himself
killing
flies
on
the
bulwark
now
this
shocked
poor
billy
he
put
out
his
long
arm
and
intercepted
a
stroke
what
is
the
row
said
the
operator
you
must
said
billy
solemnly
looking
into
his
face
with
great
dreamy
eyes
you
be
said
the
other
and
lent
him
a
tap
on
the
cheek
with
the
yarn
billy
did
not
seem
to
mind
this
his
skin
had
little
sensibility
owing
to
his
disorder
jack
recommenced
on
his
flies
and
the
bystanders
laughed
they
always
laughed
now
at
everything
billy
said
as
society
used
to
laugh
when
the
late
theodore
hook
asked
for
the
mustard
at
dinner
and
would
have
laughed
if
he
had
said
you
see
me
sad
i
have
just
lost
my
poor
david
stood
looking
on
at
the
slaughter
with
a
helpless
puzzled
air
at
last
he
seemed
to
have
an
idea
he
caught
jack
up
by
the
throat
and
knee
lifted
him
with
gigantic
strength
above
his
head
and
was
just
going
to
hurl
him
shrieking
into
the
sea
when
a
dozen
strong
hands
interfered
and
saved
the
man
then
they
were
going
to
bind
billy
hand
and
foot
but
he
was
discovered
to
be
perfectly
calm
so
they
remonstrated
instead
and
presently
billy
a
called
georgie
white
shoved
in
and
asked
him
in
a
shrill
haughty
voice
how
he
dared
do
that
my
dear
said
billy
with
great
humility
and
placidity
he
was
killing
god
creatures
no
allowance
so
ye
see
to
save
their
lives
i
was
phrase
meaning
without
stint
or
limit
or
niggardly
admeasurement
as
there
is
of
grog
at
this
piece
of
reasoning
and
the
simplicity
and
gentle
conviction
with
which
it
was
delivered
there
was
a
roar
it
subsided
and
a
doubt
arose
whether
billy
was
altogether
in
the
wrong
well
said
one
i
daresay
life
is
sweet
to
them
little
creatures
if
they
could
speak
their
i
known
a
ship
founder
in
a
fair
breeze
all
along
of
killing
said
one
old
salt
finally
several
sided
with
billy
and
intimated
that
it
served
the
lubber
right
for
not
listening
to
and
indeed
methinks
it
was
lovely
and
touching
that
so
divine
a
ray
of
goodness
and
superior
reason
should
have
shot
from
his
heart
or
from
heaven
across
that
poor
benighted
brain
but
it
must
be
owned
his
mode
of
showing
his
humanity
was
somewhat
excessive
and
abnormal
and
smacked
of
lunacy
after
this
however
the
affection
of
his
messmates
was
not
so
contemptuous
now
the
captain
of
the
was
billy
cousin
by
marriage
reginald
bazalgette
twenty
years
ago
when
the
captain
was
a
boy
they
were
great
friends
of
late
bazalgette
had
seen
less
of
him
still
it
seems
strange
he
did
not
recognise
him
in
his
own
ship
but
one
or
two
causes
to
prevent
that
in
the
first
place
the
mind
when
turned
in
one
direction
is
not
so
sharp
in
another
and
captain
bazalgette
had
been
told
to
look
for
david
in
a
merchant
ship
bound
for
the
east
indies
in
the
next
place
insanity
alters
the
expression
of
the
face
wonderfully
and
the
captain
of
a
frigate
runs
his
eye
over
four
hundred
sailors
at
muster
or
a
hundred
at
work
not
to
examine
their
features
but
their
dress
and
bearing
at
the
one
and
their
handiness
at
the
other
the
worst
piece
of
luck
was
that
dodd
did
not
know
david
called
himself
william
thompson
so
there
stood
william
thompson
large
as
life
on
the
ship
books
and
nobody
the
wiser
captain
bazalgette
had
a
warm
regard
and
affection
for
dodd
and
did
all
he
could
indeed
he
took
great
liberties
he
stopped
and
overhauled
several
merchant
ships
for
the
truant
and
on
one
occasion
william
thompson
was
one
of
the
boat
crew
that
rowed
a
midshipman
from
the
alongside
a
merchant
ship
to
search
for
david
dodd
he
heard
the
name
and
circumstance
mentioned
in
the
boat
but
the
very
name
was
new
to
him
he
remembered
it
but
only
from
that
hour
and
told
his
loving
tyrant
georgie
white
they
had
been
overhauling
a
merchant
ship
and
looking
for
one
david
dodd
it
was
about
midsummer
the
anchored
off
one
of
the
south
sea
islands
and
sent
a
boat
ashore
for
fruit
billy
and
his
dearly
beloved
little
tyrant
georgie
white
were
among
the
crew
off
goes
georgie
to
bathe
and
billy
sits
down
on
the
beach
with
a
loving
eye
upon
him
the
water
was
calm
but
the
boy
with
the
heedlessness
of
youth
stayed
in
it
nearly
an
hour
he
was
seized
with
cramp
and
screamed
to
his
comrades
they
ran
but
they
were
half
a
mile
from
the
boat
billy
dashed
into
the
water
and
came
up
with
georgie
just
as
he
was
sinking
for
the
last
time
the
boy
gripped
him
but
by
his
great
strength
he
disentangled
himself
and
got
georgie
on
his
shoulders
and
swam
for
the
shore
meantime
the
sailors
got
into
the
boat
and
rowed
hastily
towards
them
now
billy
was
undermost
and
his
head
under
water
at
times
and
georgie
some
thought
had
helped
strangle
him
by
gripping
his
neck
with
both
arms
anyway
by
the
boy
account
just
as
they
were
getting
into
shallow
water
billy
gave
a
great
shriek
and
turned
over
on
his
back
and
georgie
paddled
with
his
hands
but
billy
soon
after
this
sunk
like
a
dead
body
while
the
boat
was
yet
fifty
yards
off
and
georgie
screamed
and
pointed
to
the
place
and
the
boat
came
up
and
took
georgie
in
and
the
water
was
so
clear
that
the
sailors
saw
billy
lie
motionless
at
the
bottom
and
hooked
him
with
a
boat
hook
and
drew
him
up
but
his
face
came
up
alongside
a
deadly
white
with
staring
eyes
and
they
shuddered
and
feared
it
was
too
late
they
took
him
into
a
house
and
stripped
him
and
rubbed
him
and
wrapped
him
in
blankets
and
put
him
by
the
hot
fire
but
all
would
not
do
then
having
dried
his
clothes
they
dressed
the
body
again
and
laid
him
in
the
boat
and
cast
the
union
jack
over
him
and
rowed
slowly
and
unwillingly
back
to
the
ship
georgie
sobbing
and
screaming
over
the
body
and
not
a
dry
eye
in
the
boat
the
body
was
carried
up
the
side
and
uncovered
just
as
dodd
saw
in
her
dream
the
surgeon
was
sent
for
and
examined
the
body
and
then
the
grim
routine
of
a
dealt
swiftly
with
the
poor
skipper
he
was
carried
below
to
be
prepared
for
a
sailor
grave
then
the
surgeon
walked
aft
and
reported
formally
to
the
officer
of
the
watch
the
death
by
drowning
of
william
thompson
the
officer
of
the
watch
went
instantly
to
the
captain
in
his
cabin
and
reported
the
death
the
captain
gave
the
stereotyped
order
to
bury
him
at
noon
next
day
and
the
body
was
stripped
that
night
and
sewed
up
in
his
hammock
with
a
portion
of
his
clothes
and
bedding
to
conceal
the
outline
of
the
corpse
and
two
cannon
balls
at
his
feet
and
so
the
poor
skipper
was
laid
out
for
a
watery
grave
and
covered
by
the
union
jack
i
do
know
whether
any
of
my
amorous
young
readers
are
much
affected
by
the
catastrophe
i
have
just
related
if
not
i
will
just
remind
them
that
even
edward
dodd
was
prepared
to
oppose
the
marriage
of
julia
and
alfred
if
any
serious
ill
should
befall
his
father
at
sea
owing
to
alfred
imprudent
interference
in
rescuing
him
from
drayton
house
chapter
l
law
minute
study
of
my
has
revealed
to
me
that
there
are
many
intelligent
persons
who
think
that
a
suit
at
law
commences
in
court
this
is
not
so
many
suits
are
fought
and
decided
by
the
special
pleaders
and
so
never
come
into
court
and
as
a
stiff
encounter
of
this
kind
actually
took
place
in
hardie
hardie
a
word
of
prefatory
explanation
may
be
proper
suitors
come
into
court
only
to
try
an
issue
an
issue
is
a
mutual
lie
direct
and
towards
this
both
parties
are
driven
upon
paper
by
the
laws
of
pleading
which
may
be
thus
summed
every
statement
of
the
adversary
must
either
be
contradicted
flat
or
confessed
and
avoided
avoided
means
neutralised
by
fresh
matter
nothing
must
be
advanced
by
plaintiff
which
does
not
disclose
a
ground
of
action
at
law
nothing
advanced
by
defendant
which
if
true
would
not
be
a
defence
to
the
action
these
rules
exclude
in
a
vast
degree
the
pitiable
defects
and
vices
that
mark
all
the
unprofessional
arguments
one
ever
hears
for
on
a
breach
of
any
one
of
the
said
rules
the
other
party
can
demur
the
demurrer
is
argued
before
the
judges
in
banco
and
if
successfully
the
faulty
plaint
or
faulty
plea
is
dismissed
and
often
of
course
the
cause
won
or
lost
thereby
and
the
country
saved
the
trouble
and
the
suitors
the
expense
of
trying
an
issue
so
the
writ
being
served
by
plt
attorney
and
an
appearance
put
in
by
deft
the
paper
battle
began
by
alfred
hardie
through
his
attorney
serving
on
deft
attorney
the
this
was
drawn
by
his
junior
counsel
garrow
and
ran
thus
after
specifying
the
court
and
the
date
to
alfred
hardie
by
john
compton
his
attorney
sues
thomas
hardie
for
that
the
deft
assaulted
plt
gave
him
into
custody
to
a
certain
person
and
caused
him
to
be
imprisoned
for
a
long
space
of
time
in
a
certain
place
to
wit
a
lunatic
asylum
whereby
the
plt
was
much
inconvenienced
and
suffered
much
anguish
and
pain
in
mind
and
body
and
was
unable
to
attend
to
his
affairs
and
was
injured
in
his
credit
and
circumstances
and
the
plt
claims
compton
conveyed
a
copy
of
this
to
alfred
and
said
it
was
a
sweet
what
said
alfred
is
that
all
i
have
suffered
at
these
miscreants
hands
why
it
is
written
with
an
compton
explained
that
this
was
the
outline
counsel
will
lay
the
colours
on
in
court
as
thick
as
you
the
defendant
replied
to
the
above
declaration
by
three
pleas
by
statute
the
deft
by
joseph
heathfield
his
attorney
says
he
is
not
guilty
and
for
a
further
plea
the
deft
says
that
before
and
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
imprisonment
plt
was
a
person
of
unsound
mind
and
incompetent
to
take
care
of
himself
and
a
proper
person
to
be
taken
care
of
and
detained
and
it
was
unfit
unsafe
improper
and
dangerous
that
he
should
be
at
large
thereupon
the
deft
being
the
uncle
of
the
plt
and
a
proper
person
to
cause
the
plt
to
be
taken
charge
of
under
due
care
and
treatment
in
that
behalf
did
cause
the
plt
to
be
so
taken
charge
of
and
detained
under
due
care
and
treatment
the
third
plea
was
the
stinger
but
too
long
to
cite
it
went
to
this
tune
that
the
plaintiff
at
and
before
the
time
had
conducted
himself
like
a
person
of
unsound
mind
and
two
certificates
that
he
was
insane
had
been
given
by
two
persons
duly
authorised
under
the
statute
to
sign
such
certificates
and
the
defendant
had
believed
and
did
believe
these
certificates
to
be
true
the
first
of
these
pleas
was
a
mere
formal
plea
under
the
statute
the
second
raised
the
very
issue
at
common
law
the
plaintiff
wished
to
try
the
third
made
john
compton
knit
his
brows
with
perplexity
this
is
a
very
nasty
plea
said
he
to
alfred
a
regular
trap
if
we
join
issue
on
it
we
must
be
defeated
for
how
can
we
deny
the
certificates
were
in
form
and
yet
the
plaguy
thing
is
not
loose
enough
to
be
demurred
to
colls
who
drew
these
pleas
for
them
mr
colvin
make
a
note
to
employ
him
in
our
next
stiff
alfred
was
staggered
he
had
thought
to
ride
over
defendant
a
common
expectation
of
plaintiffs
but
seldom
realised
lawyers
fight
hard
the
pleas
were
taken
to
garrow
he
said
there
was
but
one
course
to
demur
to
no
so
the
plaintiff
joined
issue
on
all
the
defendant
pleas
and
as
to
the
last
plea
the
plaintiff
said
the
same
was
bad
in
defendant
rejoined
that
the
same
was
good
in
substance
and
thus
hardie
hardie
divided
itself
into
two
cases
a
question
of
law
for
the
judges
and
an
issue
for
the
mixed
tribunal
loosely
called
a
jury
and
i
need
hardly
say
that
should
the
defendant
win
either
of
them
he
would
gain
the
cause
postponing
the
history
of
the
legal
i
shall
show
how
heathfield
fought
off
the
and
cooled
the
ardent
alfred
and
sickened
him
of
law
in
theory
every
englishman
has
a
right
to
be
tried
by
his
peers
but
in
fact
there
are
five
gentlemen
in
every
court
each
of
whom
has
by
precedent
the
power
to
refuse
him
a
jury
by
simply
postponing
the
trial
term
after
term
until
the
death
of
one
of
the
parties
when
the
action
if
a
personal
one
dies
too
and
by
a
singular
anomaly
of
judicial
practice
if
a
slippery
deft
ca
persuade
or
judges
of
the
common
law
court
to
connive
at
what
i
venture
to
call
the
postponement
swindle
he
can
actually
go
to
and
one
after
another
with
his
rejected
application
and
the
previous
refusal
of
the
other
judges
to
delay
and
baffle
justice
goes
for
little
or
nothing
so
that
the
postponing
swindler
has
five
to
one
in
his
favour
heathfield
began
this
game
unluckily
they
applied
to
a
judge
in
chambers
for
a
month
to
plead
compton
opposed
in
person
and
showed
that
this
was
absurd
the
judge
allowed
them
only
four
days
to
plead
issue
being
joined
compton
pushed
on
for
trial
and
the
cause
was
set
down
for
the
november
term
towards
the
end
of
the
term
heathfield
applied
to
one
of
the
puisne
judges
for
a
postponement
on
the
ground
that
a
principal
witness
could
not
attend
application
was
supported
by
the
attorney
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
speers
was
in
boulogne
and
had
written
to
him
to
say
that
he
had
met
with
a
railway
accident
and
feared
he
could
not
possibly
come
to
england
in
less
than
a
month
a
respectable
french
doctor
confirmed
this
by
certificate
compton
opposed
but
the
judge
would
hardly
hear
him
and
postponed
the
trial
as
a
matter
of
course
this
carried
it
over
the
sittings
into
next
term
alfred
groaned
but
bore
it
patiently
not
so
sampson
he
raged
against
secret
tribunals
see
how
men
deteriorate
the
moment
they
get
out
of
the
full
light
of
publeecity
what
english
judge
sitting
in
the
light
of
shorthand
would
admit
swears
that
gill
says
for
legal
evidence
speers
has
sworn
to
no
facks
heathfield
has
sworn
to
no
facks
but
th
existence
of
speer
hearsay
they
are
a
couple
o
lyres
i
bet
ye
ten
pounds
t
a

as
well
as
compton
quietly
reminded
him
there

a
direct
statement
the

amazed
mai

at
all
i

how
will
you
find
out
how
why
set
the

he
wrote
off
to
the
prefect
of
police
at
boulogne
and
in
four
days
received
an
answer
headed
information
in
the
interest
of
the
prefect
informed
him
there
had
been
no
railway
accident
but
that
the
sieur
speers
english
subject
had
really
hurt
his
leg
getting
out
of
a
railway
carriage
six
weeks
ago
and
had
kept
his
room
some
days
but
he
had
been
cured
some
weeks
and
going
about
his
business
and
made
an
excursion
to
paris
on
this
compton
offered
sampson
the
shilling
but
he
declined
to
take
it
the
lie
was
said
he
and
here
a
judge
and
an
attorney
could
been
all
their
lives
sifting
evidence
too
oh
the
darkness
of
the
profissional
mind
the
next
term
came
compton
delivered
the
briefs
and
fees
subpoenaed
the
witnesses
and
alfred
came
up
with
a
good
heart
to
get
his
stigma
removed
by
twelve
honest
men
in
the
light
of
day
but
first
one
case
was
taken
out
of
its
order
and
put
before
him
then
another
till
term
wore
near
an
end
then
heathfield
applied
to
another
judge
of
the
court
for
a
postponement
richard
hardie
plaintiff
father
a
most
essential
witness
was
ill
at
clare
court
medical
certificate
and
letter
herewith
compton
opposed
now
this
judge
was
a
keen
and
honourable
lawyer
with
a
lofty
hatred
of
all
professional
tricks
he
heard
the
two
attorneys
and
delivered
himself
to
this
effect
only
of
course
in
better
legal
phrase
i
shall
make
no
order
the
defendant
has
been
here
before
on
a
doubtful
affidavit
you
know
heathfield
juries
in
these
cases
go
by
the
plaintiff
evidence
and
his
conduct
under
and
i
think
it
would
not
be
just
nor
humane
to
keep
this
plaintiff
in
suspense
and
mortuum
any
longer
you
can
take
out
a
commission
to
examine
richard
to
this
compton
nailed
him
but
the
commission
took
time
and
while
it
was
pending
heathfield
went
to
another
judge
with
another
disabled
witness
peggy
black
that
naive
personage
was
nursing
her
deceased
sister
children
in
an
affidavit
and
they
had
scarlatina

certificate
to
that
effect
compton
opposed
and
pointed
out
the
blot
you
do
want
the
children
in
the
said
he
and
we
are
not
to
be
robbed
of
our
trial
because
one
of
your
witnesses
prefer
nursing
other
people
children
to
facing
the
the

nodded
assent
i

said
he
heathfield
went
out
from
his
presence

sent
a

of
the
children
medical
certificate
to
follow
by
post
four
judges
out
of
the
five
were
now
awake
to
the
move
but
heathfield
tinkered
the
hole
in
his
late
affidavit
with
telegram
and
slipped
down
to
westminster
to
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
who
had
had
no
opportunity
of
watching
the
growth
and
dissemination
of
disease
among
deft
witnesses
compton
fought
this
time
by
counsel
and
with
a
powerful
affidavit
but
luck
was
against
him
the
judge
had
risen
to
go
home
he
listened
standing
compton
counsel
was
feeble
did
not
feel
the
wrong
how
could
he
lawyers
fatten
by
delays
of
justice
as
physicians
do
by
tardy
cure
the
postponement
was
granted
alfred
cursed
them
all
and
his
own
folly
in
believing
that
an
alleged
lunatic
would
be
allowed
fair
play
at
westminster
or
anywhere
else
compton
took
snuff
and
sampson
appealed
to
the
press
again
he
wrote
a
long
letter
exposing
with
fearless
irony
the
postponement
swindle
as
it
had
been
worked
in
hardie
hardie
and
wound
up
with
this
fiery
peroration
this
englishman
sues
not
merely
for
damages
but
to
recover
lost
rights
dearer
far
than
money
of
which
he
says
he
has
been
unjustly
robbed
his
right
to
walk
in
daylight
on
the
soil
of
his
native
land
without
being
seized
and
tied
up
for
life
like
a
nigger
or
a
dog
his
footing
in
society
a
chance
to
earn
his
bread
and
a
place
among
mankind
ay
among
mankind
for
a
lunatic
is
an
animal
in
the
law
eye
and
society
and
an
alleged
lunatic
is
a
lunatic
till
a
jury
clears
him
i
appeal
to
you
gentlemen
is
not
such
a
suitor
sacred
in
all
wise
and
good
men
minds
is
he
not
defendant
as
well
as
plaintiff
why
his
stake
is
enormous
compared
with
the
nominal
defendant
and
if
i
know
right
from
wrong
to
postpone
his
trial
a
fourth
time
would
be
to
insult
divine
justice
and
trifle
with
human
misery
and
shock
the
common
sense
of
the
doctor
pen
neither
clipped
the
words
nor
minced
the
matter
you
see
reading
this
the
water
came
into
alfred
eyes
ah
staunch
friend
he
said
how
few
are
like
you
to
the
intellectual
dwarfs
who
conspire
with
my
oppressors
hardie
hardie
is
but
a
family
squabble
omnia
compton
read
it
too
and
said
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
heaven
defend
us
from
our
friends
this
is
enough
to
make
the
courts
decline
to
try
the
case
at
and
indeed
it
did
not
cure
the
evil
for
next
term
another
was
set
up
speers
to
wit
this
gentleman
deposed
to
having
come
over
on
purpose
to
attend
the
trial
but
having
inadvertently
stepped
aside
as
far
as
wales
he
lay
there
stricken
with
a
mysterious
malady
and
had
just
strength
to
forward
medical
certificate
on
this
the
judge
in
spite
of
remonstrance
adjourned
hardie
hardie
to
the
summer
term
summer
came
the
evil
day
drew
nigh
heathfield
got
the
venue
changed
from
westminster
to
london
which
was
the
fifth
postponement
at
last
the
cause
came
on
the
parties
and
witnesses
were
all
in
court
with
two
whole
days
before
them
to
try
it
in
sampson
rushed
in
furious
there
is
some
deviltry
afloat
said
he
i
was
in
the
house
of
commons
last
night
and
there
i
saw
the
defendant
counsel
earwigging
the
nonsense
said
compton
such
suspicions
are
ridiculous
do
you
think
they
can
talk
of
nothing
but
hardie
hardie
mai
dearr
sirr
my
son
met
one
of
heathfield
clerks
at
dinner
and
he
let
out
that
the
trile
was
not
to
come
off
put
this
and
that
together
it
will
come
off
said
compton
and
in
five
minutes
at
in
less
than
that
time
the
learned
judge
came
in
and
before
taking
his
seat
made
this
extraordinary
speech
i
hear
this
cause
will
take
three
days
to
try
and
we
have
only
two
days
before
us
it
would
be
inconvenient
to
leave
it
unfinished
and
i
must
proceed
on
circuit
the
day
after
it
must
be
a
remanet
no
man
can
do
more
than
time
plaintiff
counsel
made
a
feeble
remonstrance
then
yielded
and
the
crier
with
sonorous
voice
called
on
the
case
of
bread
cheese
in
which
there
were
pounds
at
stake
but
no
principle
oh
with
what
zest
they
all
went
into
it
being
small
men
escaping
from
a
great
thing
to
a
small
one
never
hopped
frogs
into
a
ditch
with
more
alacrity
alfred
left
the
court
and
hid
himself
and
the
scalding
tears
forced
their
way
down
his
cheeks
at
this
heartless
proceeding
to
let
all
the
witnesses
come
into
court
at
a
vast
expense
to
the
parties
and
raise
the
cup
of
justice
to
the
lips
of
the
oppressed
and
then
pretend
he
knew
a
trial
would
last
more
than
two
days
and
so
shirk
it
i
have
made
that
a
reason
for
sitting
till
midnight
said
poor
alfred
not
for
prolonging
a
poor
injured
man
agony
four
mortal
he
then
prayed
god
earnestly
for
this
great
postponer
death
as
the
only
event
that
could
give
him
back
an
englishman
right
of
being
tried
by
his
peers
and
so
went
down
to
oxford
as
for
sampson
he
was
most
indignant
and
said
a
public
man
had
no
business
with
a
private
ear
and
wanted
to
appeal
to
the
press
again
but
the
doughty
doctor
had
a
gentle
but
powerful
ruler
at
home
as
fiery
houses
are
best
ruled
by
a
gentle
hand
sampson
requested
him
to
write
no
more
but
look
round
for
an
to
draw
these
repeated
defeats
of
justice
to
the
notice
of
the
house
now
there
was
a
mr
bite
who
had
taken
a
prominent
and
honourable
part
in
lunacy
questions
headed
committees
and
so
on
this
seemed
the
man
sampson
sent
him
a
letter
saying
there
was
a
flagrant
case
of
a
sane
man
falsely
imprisoned
who
had
now
been
near
a
year
applying
for
a
jury
and
juggled
out
of
this
constitutional
right
by
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
postponements
would
mr
bite
give
him
sampson
ten
minutes
and
no
more
when
he
would
explain
the
case
and
leave
documentary
evidence
behind
him
for
mr
bite
to
test
his
statement
the
philanthropical
replied
promptly
in
these
exact
words
mr
bite
presents
his
compliments
to
sampson
to
state
that
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
go
into
his
case
nor
to
give
him
the
time
he
requests
to
do
sampson
was
a
little
indignant
at
the
man
insolence
but
far
more
at
having
been
duped
by
his
public
assumption
of
philanthropy
the
little
pragmatical
impostor
he
roared
with
what
a
sense
o
relief
animal
flings
off
the
mask
of
humanity
when
there
is
no
easy
eclat
to
be
gained
by
he
sent
the
philanthropical
bite
revelation
of
his
private
self
to
alfred
who
returned
it
with
this
single
remark
homunculi
quanti
sunt
dishonest
suitors
all
try
to
postpone
but
they
do
not
gain
unmixed
good
thereby
these
delays
give
time
for
more
evidence
to
come
in
and
this
slow
coming
and
chance
evidence
is
singularly
adverse
to
the
unjust
suitor
of
this
came
a
notable
example
in
october
next
and
made
richard
hardie
determined
to
precipitate
the
trial
and
even
regret
he
had
not
fought
it
out
long
ago
he
had
just
returned
from
consulting
heathfield
and
sat
down
to
a
nice
little
dinner
in
his
apartments
sackville
street
when
a
visitor
was
announced
and
in
came
the
slouching
little
figure
of
barkington
noah
skinner
diamond
cut
diamond
hardie
suppressed
a
start
and
said
nothing
skinner
bowed
low
with
a
mixture
of
his
old
cringing
way
and
a
certain
sly
triumphant
leer
so
that
his
body
seemed
to
say
one
thing
and
his
face
the
opposite
hardie
eyed
him
and
saw
that
his
coat
was
rusty
and
his
hat
napless
then
hardie
smelt
a
beggar
and
prepared
to
parry
all
attempts
upon
his
purse
i
hope
i
see
my
old
master
well
said
skinner
coaxingly
pretty
well
in
body
skinner
thank
i
had
a
deal
of
trouble
to
find
you
sir
but
i
heard
of
the
great
lawsuit
between
alfred
and
you
and
i
knew
heathfield
was
your
solicitor
so
i
watched
at
his
place
day
after
day
and
at
last
you
came
oh
i
was
so
pleased
when
i
saw
your
noble
figure
but
i
speak
to
you
in
the
street
for
fear
of
disgracing
you
i
such
a
poor
little
guy
to
be
addressing
a
gentleman
like
now
this
sounded
well
on
the
surface
but
below
there
was
a
subtle
something
hardie
did
not
like
at
all
but
he
took
the
cue
and
said
my
poor
skinner
do
you
think
i
would
turn
up
my
nose
at
a
faithful
old
servant
like
you
have
a
glass
of
wine
with
me
and
tell
me
how
you
have
been
getting
he
went
behind
a
screen
and
opened
a
door
and
soon
returned
with
a
decanter
leaving
the
door
open
now
in
the
next
room
sat
unbeknown
to
skinner
a
young
woman
with
white
eyelashes
sewing
buttons
on
hardie
shirts
that
astute
gentleman
gave
her
instructions
and
important
ones
too
with
a
silent
gesture
then
reappeared
and
filled
the
bumper
high
to
his
faithful
servant
they
drank
one
another
healths
with
great
cordiality
real
or
apparent
hardie
then
asked
skinner
carelessly
if
he
could
do
anything
for
him
skinner
said
well
sir
i
am
very
so
am
i
between
you
and
me
said
hardie
confidentially
i
mind
telling
you
those
confounded
commissioners
of
lunacy
wrote
to
alfred
trustees
and
i
have
been
forced
to
replace
a
loan
of
five
thousand
pounds
that
board
always
sides
with
the
insane
that
crippled
me
and
drove
me
to
the
exchange
and
now
what
i
had
left
is
all
invested
in
a
month
settles
my
fate
a
little
fortune
or
absolute
you
be
lucky
sir
you
be
lucky
said
skinner
cheerfully
you
have
such
a
long
head
not
like
poor
little
me
the
exchange
soon
burnt
my
wings
not
a
shilling
left
of
the
thousand
pounds
sir
you
were
so
good
as
to
give
me
for
my
faithful
services
but
you
will
give
me
another
chance
sir
i
know
i
take
better
care
this
hardie
shook
his
head
sorrowfully
and
said
it
was
impossible
skinner
eyed
him
askant
and
remarked
quietly
and
half
aside
of
course
i
go
to
the
other
party
but
i
should
like
to
do
that
they
would
come
down
what
other
party
la
sir
what
other
party
why
dodd
or
alfred
here
the
trial
coming
on
you
know
and
of
course
if
they
could
get
me
to
go
on
the
box
and
tell
all
i
know
or
half
what
i
know
why
the
judge
and
jury
would
say
locking
alfred
up
for
mad
was
a
hardie
quaked
internally
but
he
hid
it
grandly
and
once
more
was
a
spartan
gnawed
beneath
his
robe
by
this
little
fox
what
said
he
sternly
after
all
i
and
mine
have
done
for
you
and
yours
would
you
be
so
base
as
to
go
and
sell
yourself
to
my
enemies
never
sir
shouted
skinner
zealously
then
in
a
whisper
not
if
you
make
a
bid
for
how
much
do
you
demand
only
another
thousand
sir
a
thousand
pounds
why
what
is
that
to
you
sir
you
are
rich
enough
to
buy
the
eighth
commandment
out
of
the
tables
of
ten
per
cent
and
then
the
lawsuit
hardies
hardies
you
have
spoken
plainly
at
last
said
hardie
grimly
this
is
extorting
money
by
threats
do
you
know
that
nothing
is
more
criminal
nor
more
easy
to
punish
i
can
take
you
before
a
magistrate
and
imprison
you
on
the
instant
for
this
attempt
i
will
try
it
said
skinner
coolly
where
your
witness
behind
that
peggy
came
forward
directly
with
a
pen
in
her
hand
skinner
was
manifestly
startled
and
disconcerted
i
have
taken
all
your
words
down
skinner
said
peggy
softly
then
to
her
master
shall
i
go
for
a
policeman
sir
hardie
reflected
yes
said
he
sternly
there
no
other
course
with
such
a
lump
of
treachery
and
ingratitude
as
peggy
whipped
on
her
bonnet
what
a
hurry
you
are
in
whined
skinner
a
policeman
ought
to
be
the
last
argument
for
old
friends
to
run
then
fawning
spitefully
do
talk
of
indicting
me
sir
said
he
it
makes
me
shiver
why
how
will
you
look
when
i
up
and
tell
them
all
how
captain
dodd
was
took
with
apoplexy
in
our
office
and
how
you
nailed
fourteen
thousand
pounds
off
his
senseless
body
and
forgot
to
put
them
down
in
your
so
they
are
not
whitewashed
off
like
the
any
witnesses
to
all
this
skinner
yes
who
well
your
own
conscience
one
said
skinner
he
is
mad
peggy
said
hardie
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
then
looked
skinner
full
in
the
face
and
said
nobody
was
ever
seized
with
apoplexy
in
my
office
nobody
ever
gave
me
and
if
this
is
the
probable
tale
with
which
you
come
here
to
break
the
law
and
extort
money
leave
my
house
this
instant
and
if
ever
you
dare
to
utter
this
absurd
and
malicious
slander
you
shall
lie
within
four
stone
walls
and
learn
what
it
is
for
a
shabby
vagabond
to
come
without
a
witness
to
his
back
and
libel
a
man
of
property
and
skinner
let
him
run
on
in
this
loud
triumphant
strain
till
he
had
quite
done
then
put
out
a
brown
skinny
finger
and
poked
him
lightly
in
the
ribs
and
said
quite
quietly
and
oh
so
drily
with
a
knowing
wink
i
got
the
chapter
li
hardie
collapsed
as
if
he
had
been
a
man
inflated
and
that
touch
had
punctured
him
ah
said
he
ah
said
skinner
in
a
mighty
different
tone
insolent
triumph
to
wit
after
a
pause
hardie
made
an
effort
and
said
contemptuously
the
receipt
if
any
was
flung
into
the
dusthole
and
carried
away
do
you
think
i
have
forgotten
that
do
you
believe
it
sir
was
the
reply
while
you
turned
your
back
and
sacked
the
money
i
said
to
myself
is
that
the
game
and
nailed
the
receipt
what
a
couple
of
scoundrels
we
were
i
would
have
her
know
it
for
all
your
money
come
sir
i
see
its
all
right
you
will
shell
out
sooner
than
be
here
peggy
interposed
mr
skinner
be
more
considerate
my
master
is
really
poor
just
that
is
no
reason
why
i
should
be
insulted
and
indicted
and
trampled
under
foot
snarled
skinner
all
in
one
breath
show
me
the
receipt
and
take
my
last
shilling
you
ungrateful
vindictive
viper
groaned
hardie
stuff
and
nonsense
said
skinner
i
not
a
viper
i
a
man
of
business
find
me
five
hundred
pounds
and
i
show
you
the
receipt
and
keep
dark
but
i
ca
afford
to
give
it
you
for
that
of
skinner
triumphed
and
made
the
great
man
apologise
writhing
all
the
time
and
wishing
he
was
a
day
labourer
with
peggy
to
wife
and
fourteen
honest
shillings
a
week
for
his
income
having
eaten
humble
pie
he
agreed
to
meet
skinner
next
wednesday
at
midnight
alone
under
a
certain
lamp
on
the
north
kensington
road
the
interval
four
days
he
required
to
raise
money
upon
his
scrip
skinner
bowed
himself
out
fawning
triumphantly
hardie
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
motionless
scowling
darkly
peggy
looked
at
him
and
saw
some
dark
and
sinister
resolve
forming
in
his
mind
she
divined
it
as
such
women
can
divine
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
said
softly
richard
not
worth
he
started
to
find
his
soul
read
through
his
body
so
clearly
he
trembled
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
his
blood
be
on
his
own
head
he
snarled
this
is
not
my
seeking
he
shall
learn
what
it
is
to
drive
richard
hardie
to
no
no
implored
peggy
there
are
other
countries
beside
this
why
not
gather
all
you
have
and
cross
the
water
i
follow
you
to
the
world
end
mind
your
own
business
said
he
fiercely
she
made
no
reply
but
went
softly
and
sat
down
again
and
sewed
the
buttons
on
his
shirts
hardie
wrote
to
heathfield
to
get
hardie
hardie
tried
as
soon
as
possible
meantime
came
a
mental
phenomenon
gliding
down
sackville
street
victorious
skinner
suddenly
stopped
and
clenched
his
hands
and
his
face
writhed
as
if
he
had
received
a
in
that
instant
remorse
had
struck
him
like
lightning
and
perhaps
whence
comes
the
lightning
the
sweet
face
and
voice
that
had
smiled
on
him
and
cared
for
his
body
and
cared
for
his
soul
came
to
his
mind
and
knocked
at
his
heart
and
conscience
he
went
home
miserable
with
an
inward
conflict
and
it
lasted
him
all
the
four
days
sometimes
remorse
got
the
better
sometimes
avarice
he
came
to
the
interview
still
undecided
what
he
should
do
but
meantime
he
had
gone
to
a
lawyer
and
made
his
will
leaving
his
little
all
to
julia
dodd
a
bad
sign
this
looked
like
compounding
with
his
awakened
conscience
it
was
a
dark
and
gusty
night
very
few
people
were
about
skinner
waited
a
little
while
and
shivered
for
his
avarice
had
postponed
the
purchase
of
a
greatcoat
until
christmas
day
at
last
when
the
coast
seemed
clear
hardie
emerged
from
a
side
street
skinner
put
his
hand
to
his
bosom
they
met
hardie
said
quietly
i
must
ask
you
just
for
form
to
show
me
you
have
the
of
course
sir
but
not
so
near
please
no
snatching
if
i
know
you
are
wonderfully
suspicious
said
hardie
trying
to
smile
skinner
looked
and
saw
by
the
lamplight
he
was
deadly
pale
keep
your
distance
a
moment
sir
said
he
and
on
hardie
complying
took
the
receipt
out
and
held
it
under
the
lamp
instantly
hardie
drew
a
and
sprang
on
him
with
a
savage
curse
and
uttered
a
shriek
of
dismay
for
he
was
met
by
the
long
shiny
barrel
of
a
that
skinner
drew
from
his
bosom
and
levelled
full
in
the
haggard
face
that
came
at
him
hardie
recoiled
crying
no
no
for
heaven
sake
what
cried
skinner
stepping
forward
and
hissing
do
you
think
such
a
fool
as
to
meet
a
thief
unarmed
come
cash
up
or
i
blow
you
to
no
no
no
said
hardie
piteously
retreating
as
skinner
marched
on
him
with
long
extended
pistol
skinner
he
stammered
is
cash
up
then
that
business
fling
the
five
hundred
pounds
down
and
walk
away
mind
it
is
loaded
with
two
bullets
i
make
a
double
entry
on
your
great
treacherous
it
no
use
trying
to
deceive
such
a
man
as
you
said
hardie
playing
on
his
vanity
i
could
not
get
the
money
before
saturday
and
so
i
listened
to
the
dictates
of
despair
forgive
then
come
again
saturday
night
come
alone
and
i
shall
bring
a
man
to
see
i
not
murdered
and
look
here
sir
if
you
do
come
to
the
hour
and
do
the
right
thing
without
any
more
of
these
tricks
by
heaven
i
smash
you
before
noon
on
i
i
blow
you
to
alfred
and
miss
i
come
i
tell
i
post
you
for
a
thief
on
every
brick
in
the
have
mercy
skinner
have
pity
on
the
wretched
man
whose
bread
you
have
eaten
i
tell
you
i
well
mind
you
do
then
cash
and
all
said
skinner
sulkily
but
not
quite
proof
against
the
reminiscences
those
humble
words
awakened
each
walked
backwards
a
good
dozen
steps
and
then
they
took
different
roads
skinner
taking
good
care
not
to
be
tracked
home
he
went
up
the
high
stairs
to
the
hole
in
the
roof
he
occupied
and
lighted
a
rushlight
he
had
half
a
mind
to
kindle
a
fire
he
felt
so
chilly
but
he
had
blocked
up
the
vent
partly
to
keep
out
the
cold
partly
to
shun
the
temptation
of
burning
fuel
however
he
stopped
the
keyhole
with
paper
and
also
the
sides
of
the
window
till
he
had
shut
the
wintry
air
all
out
still
what
with
the
cold
and
what
with
the
reaction
after
so
great
an
excitement
his
feeble
body
began
to
shiver
desperately
he
thought
at
last
he
would
light
a
he
had
just
purchased
for
old
iron
at
a
broker
would
only
spend
a
halfpenneyworth
of
charcoal
no
he
would
he
would
look
at
his
money
that
would
cheer
him
he
unripped
a
certain
part
of
his
straw
mattress
and
took
out
a
bag
of
gold
he
spread
three
hundred
sovereigns
on
the
floor
and
put
the
candle
down
among
them
they
sparkled
they
were
all
new
ones
and
he
rubbed
them
with
an
old
toothbrush
and
whiting
every
week
better
than
any
fire
he
said
they
warm
the
heart
for
one
thing
they
are
my
own
at
all
events
i
did
not
steal
them
nor
take
them
of
a
thief
for
a
bribe
to
keep
dark
and
defraud
honest
then
remorse
gripped
him
he
asked
himself
what
he
was
going
to
do
to
rob
an
angel
was
the
answer
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
is
all
hers
and
i
could
give
it
her
in
a
moment
curse
him
he
would
have
killed
me
for
then
he
pottered
about
and
took
out
his
will
ah
said
he
that
is
all
right
so
far
but
what
is
a
paltry
three
hundred
when
i
help
do
her
out
of
fourteen
thousand
villain
then
to
ease
his
conscience
he
took
a
slip
of
paper
and
wrote
on
it
a
short
account
of
the
receipt
and
how
he
came
by
it
and
lo
as
if
an
unseen
power
had
guided
his
hand
he
added
miss
dodd
lives
at
pembroke
street
and
i
am
going
to
take
it
to
her
as
soon
as
i
am
well
of
my
whether
this
preceded
an
unconscious
resolve
which
had
worked
on
him
secretly
for
some
time
or
whether
it
awakened
such
a
resolve
i
hardly
know
but
certain
it
is
that
having
written
it
he
now
thought
seriously
of
doing
it
and
the
more
seriously
he
entertained
the
thought
the
more
good
it
seemed
to
do
him
he
got
the
sinner
friend
and
another
good
book
she
had
lent
him
and
read
a
bit
then
finding
his
feet
frozen
he
lighted
his
chafer
and
blew
it
well
and
put
it
under
his
feet
and
read
the
good
words
began
to
reach
his
heart
more
and
more
so
did
the
thought
of
julia
goodness
the
chafer
warmed
his
feet
and
legs
ay
said
he
men
do
want
fires
warm
the
feet
and
the
body
warms
he
took
out
the
receipt
and
held
it
in
his
hand
and
eyed
it
greedily
and
asked
himself
could
he
really
part
with
it
he
thought
he
could
to
julia
still
holding
it
tight
in
his
left
hand
he
read
on
the
good
but
solemn
words
that
seemed
to
loosen
his
grasp
upon
that
paper
how
good
it
was
of
her
he
thought
to
come
day
after
day
and
feed
a
poor
little
fellow
like
him
body
and
soul
she
asked
nothing
back
she
did
know
he
could
make
her
any
return
bless
her
bless
her
he
screamed
oh
how
cruel
i
have
been
to
her
and
she
so
kind
to
me
she
would
never
let
me
want
if
i
took
her
fourteen
thousand
pounds
like
enough
give
me
a
thousand
and
help
me
save
my
poor
soul
that
i
shall
damn
if
i
meet
him
again
i
wo
go
his
way
again
lead
us
not
into
temptation
i
repent
lord
have
mercy
on
me
a
miserable
and
tears
bedewed
those
wizened
cheeks
tears
of
penitence
sincere
at
least
for
the
time
a
sleepy
languor
now
came
over
him
and
the
good
book
fell
from
his
hand
but
his
resolution
remained
unshaken
waking
up
from
a
sort
of
heavy
dose
he
took
as
it
were
a
last
look
at
the
receipt
and
murmured
my
head
how
heavy
it
but
presently
he
roused
himself
full
of
his
penitent
resolution
and
murmured
again
brokenly
i
it
to
street
to
to
chapter
lii
hardie
raised
the
money
on
his
scrip
and
at
great
inconvenience
for
he
was
holding
on
five
hundred
thousand
pounds
worth
of
old
turkish
bonds
over
an
unfavourable
settling
day
and
wanted
every
shilling
to
pay
his
broker
if
they
did
not
rise
by
next
settling
day
he
was
a
beggar
however
being
now
a
desperate
gamester
and
throwing
for
his
last
stake
he
borrowed
this
sum
and
took
it
within
a
heavy
heart
to
his
appointment
with
skinner
skinner
never
came
hardie
waited
till
one
two
no
skinner
hardie
went
home
hugging
his
five
hundred
pounds
but
very
uneasy
next
day
he
consulted
peggy
she
shook
her
head
and
said
it
looked
very
ugly
skinner
had
most
likely
got
angrier
and
angrier
with
thinking
on
the
assault
you
will
never
see
him
again
till
the
day
of
the
trial
and
then
he
will
go
down
and
bear
false
witness
against
you
why
not
leave
the
country
how
can
i
simpleton
my
money
is
all
locked
up
in
the
bargains
no
i
tied
tied
to
the
stake
i
fight
to
the
last
and
if
defeated
and
disgraced
i
die
and
end
peggy
implored
him
not
to
talk
so
i
been
down
to
the
court
said
she
softly
to
see
what
it
is
like
there
a
great
hall
and
he
must
pass
through
that
to
get
into
the
little
places
where
they
try
let
me
be
in
that
hall
with
the
five
hundred
pounds
and
i
promise
you
he
shall
never
appear
against
you
we
will
both
go
you
with
the
money
i
with
my
woman
he
gave
her
his
hand
like
a
shaky
monarch
and
said
she
had
more
wit
than
he
had
heathfield
who
had
contrived
to
postpone
hardie
hardie
six
times
in
spite
of
compton
could
not
hurry
it
on
now
with
his
it
hung
fire
from
some
cause
or
another
a
good
fortnight
and
in
this
fortnight
hardie
senior
endured
the
tortures
of
suspense
skinner
made
no
sign
at
last
there
stood
upon
the
paper
for
next
day
a
short
case
of
disputed
contract
and
hardie
hardie
now
this
day
i
must
premise
was
to
settle
the
whole
lawsuit
for
while
trial
of
the
issue
was
being
postponed
and
postponed
the
legal
question
had
been
argued
and
disposed
of
the
very
queen
counsel
unfavourable
to
the
suit
was
briefed
with
garrow
views
and
delivered
them
in
court
with
more
skill
clearness
and
effect
than
garrow
ever
could
then
sat
down
and
whispered
over
rather
contemptuously
to
compton
that
is
your
argument
i
and
admirably
put
whispered
the
attorney
in
reply
well
now
hear
saunders
knock
it
to
instead
of
that
it
was
serjeant
saunders
that
got
maltreated
first
one
judge
had
a
peck
at
him
then
another
till
they
left
him
scarce
a
feather
to
fly
with
and
when
alfred
counsel
rose
to
reply
the
judges
stopped
him
and
the
chief
of
the
court
alfred
postponing
enemy
delivered
his
judgment
after
this
fashion
we
are
all
of
opinion
that
this
plea
is
bad
in
law
by
the
common
law
of
england
no
person
can
be
imprisoned
as
a
lunatic
unless
actually
insane
at
the
time
it
has
been
held
so
for
centuries
and
down
to
the
last
case
and
wisely
for
it
would
be
most
dangerous
to
the
liberty
of
the
subject
if
a
man
could
be
imprisoned
without
remedy
unless
he
could
prove
in
the
breast
of
the
party
incarcerating
him
as
for
the
statute
it
does
not
mend
the
matter
but
rather
the
reverse
for
it
expressly
protects
duly
authorised
persons
acting
under
the
order
and
certificates
and
this
must
be
construed
to
except
from
the
protection
of
the
statute
the
person
making
the
the
three
puisne
judges
concurred
and
gave
similar
reasons
one
of
them
said
that
if
imprisoned
for
a
and
sued
him
it
was
no
defence
to
say
that
in
his
opinion
had
imitated
felony
they
cited
elliot
allen
anderdon
burrows
and
lord
mansfield
judgment
in
a
very
old
case
the
name
of
which
i
have
unfortunately
forgotten
judgment
was
entered
for
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
ingenious
plea
struck
off
the
record
and
hardie
hardie
became
the
leading
case
but
in
law
one
party
often
wins
the
skirmish
and
the
other
the
battle
the
grand
fight
as
i
have
already
said
was
to
be
but
the
high
hopes
and
ardour
with
which
the
young
lovers
had
once
come
into
court
were
now
worn
out
by
the
postponement
swindle
and
the
adverse
events
delay
had
brought
on
them
alfred
was
not
there
he
was
being
examined
in
the
schools
and
had
plumply
refused
to
leave
a
tribunal
that
named
its
day
and
kept
it
for
westminster
until
his
counsel
should
have
actually
opened
the
case
he
did
not
believe
trial
by
jury
would
ever
be
allowed
him
julia
was
there
but
sad
and
comparatively
listless
one
of
those
strange
vague
reports
which
often
herald
more
circumstantial
accounts
had
come
home
whispering
darkly
that
her
father
was
dead
and
buried
on
an
island
in
the
south
sea
she
had
kept
this
report
from
her
mother
contrary
to
edward
wish
but
she
implored
him
to
restrain
his
fatal
openness
in
one
thing
both
these
sorely
tried
young
people
agreed
that
there
could
be
no
marriage
with
alfred
now
but
here
again
julia
entreated
her
brother
not
to
be
candid
not
to
tell
alfred
this
at
present
oh
do
not
go
and
dispirit
him
just
now
she
said
or
he
will
do
something
rash
no
he
must
and
shall
get
his
and
win
his
trial
and
then
you
know
any
lady
will
be
too
proud
to
marry
him
and
when
he
is
married
and
happy
you
can
tell
him
i
did
all
i
could
for
him
and
hunted
up
the
witnesses
and
was
his
loving
friend
though
i
could
not
be
his
she
could
not
say
this
without
crying
but
she
said
it
for
all
that
and
meant
it
too
besides
helping
compton
to
get
up
the
evidence
this
true
and
earnest
friend
and
lover
had
attended
the
court
day
after
day
to
watch
how
things
were
done
and
womanlike
to
see
what
and
what
the
court
the
witnesses
subpoenaed
on
either
side
in
hardie
hardie
began
to
arrive
at
ten
and
a
tall
stately
man
paraded
westminster
hall
to
see
if
skinner
came
with
them
all
other
anxieties
had
merged
in
this
for
the
counsel
had
assured
him
if
nothing
unexpected
turned
up
thomas
hardie
would
have
a
verdict
or
if
not
the
damages
would
be
nominal
at
last
the
court
crier
cried
with
a
loud
voice
hardie
julia
eyes
roved
very
anxiously
for
alfred
and
up
rose
garrow
and
stated
to
the
court
the
substance
of
the
declaration
to
this
he
said
three
pleas
have
been
pleaded
first
the
plea
of
not
guilty
which
is
a
formal
plea
also
another
plea
which
has
been
demurred
to
and
struck
off
the
record
and
lastly
that
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
imprisonment
the
plaintiff
was
of
unsound
mind
and
a
fit
person
to
be
confined
which
is
the
issue
now
to
be
garrow
then
sat
down
very
tired
of
this
preliminary
work
and
wondering
when
he
should
have
the
luck
to
conduct
such
a
case
as
hardie
hardie
and
leaned
forward
to
be
ready
to
prompt
his
senior
a
portly
counsel
whom
compton
had
retained
because
he
was
great
at
addressing
juries
and
no
point
of
law
could
now
arise
in
the
case
colt
rose
like
a
tower
knowing
very
little
of
the
facts
and
seeming
to
know
everything
he
had
a
prodigious
business
and
was
rather
indolent
and
often
skimmed
his
brief
at
home
and
then
mastered
it
in
court
if
he
got
time
now
it
is
a
good
general
policy
to
open
a
plaintiffs
case
warily
and
reserve
your
rhetoric
for
the
reply
and
colt
always
took
this
line
when
his
manifold
engagements
compelled
him
as
in
hardie
hardie
to
teach
his
case
first
and
learn
it
afterwards
i
will
only
add
that
in
the
course
of
his
opening
he
was
on
the
edge
of
seven
distinct
blunders
but
garrow
watched
him
and
always
shot
a
whisper
like
a
bullet
just
in
time
colt
took
it
and
glided
away
from
incipient
error
imperceptibly
and
with
a
tact
you
can
have
no
conception
of
the
jury
did
not
detect
the
creaking
of
this
machinery
serjeant
saunders
did
and
grinned
satirically
so
did
poor
julia
and
her
cheeks
burned
and
her
eyes
flashed
indignant
fire
and
horror
of
horrors
alfred
did
not
appear
colt
opening
may
be
thus
condensed
the
plaintiff
was
a
young
gentleman
of
great
promise
and
distinction
on
whom
as
usual
in
these
cases
of
false
imprisonment
money
was
settled
he
was
a
distinguished
student
at
eton
and
oxford
and
no
doubt
was
ever
expressed
of
his
sanity
till
he
proposed
to
marry
and
take
his
money
out
of
his
trustees
hands
by
a
marriage
settlement
on
this
his
father
who
up
to
that
time
had
managed
his
funds
as
principal
trustee
showed
him
great
personal
hostility
for
some
time
and
looked
out
for
a
tool
that
tool
he
soon
found
in
his
brother
the
defendant
a
person
who
it
would
be
proved
had
actually
not
seen
the
plaintiff
for
a
year
and
a
half
yet
with
great
recklessness
and
inhumanity
had
signed
away
his
liberty
and
his
happiness
behind
his
back
then
tools
of
another
kind
the
kind
that
anybody
can
buy
a
couple
of
doctors
were
as
usual
easily
found
to
sign
the
certificates
one
of
these
doctors
had
never
seen
him
but
for
five
minutes
and
signed
in
manifest
collusion
with
the
other
they
decoyed
this
poor
young
gentleman
away
on
his
wedding
morning
on
his
wedding
morning
gentlemen
mark
that
and
consigned
him
to
the
worst
of
all
dungeons
what
he
suffered
there
he
must
himself
relate
to
you
for
we
who
have
the
happiness
to
walk
abroad
in
the
air
of
reason
and
liberty
are
little
able
to
realise
the
agony
of
mind
endured
by
a
sane
man
confined
among
the
insane
what
we
undertake
is
to
prove
his
sanity
up
to
the
very
hour
of
his
incarceration
and
also
that
he
was
quite
sane
at
the
time
when
a
brutal
attempt
to
recapture
him
by
violence
was
made
under
the
defendant
order
and
defeated
by
his
own
remarkable
intelligence
and
courage
along
with
the
facts
the
true
reason
why
he
was
imprisoned
will
probably
come
out
but
i
am
not
bound
to
prove
sinister
motives
it
is
for
the
defendant
to
prove
if
he
can
that
he
had
lawful
motives
for
a
lawless
act
and
that
he
exercised
due
precaution
and
did
not
lend
himself
recklessly
to
the
dark
designs
of
others
if
he
succeed
in
this
that
may
go
in
mitigation
of
damages
though
it
can
not
affect
the
verdict
principal
object
is
the
verdict
which
will
remove
the
foul
aspersion
cast
on
my
injured
client
and
restore
him
to
society
and
to
this
verdict
we
are
entitled
unless
the
other
side
can
prove
the
plaintiff
was
insane
call
alfred
hardie
and
with
this
he
sat
down
an
official
called
alfred
hardie
very
loud
he
made
no
reply
julia
rose
from
her
seat
with
dismay
painted
on
her
countenance
compton
garrow
and
colt
heads
clashed
together
colt
jumped
up
again
and
said
my
lud
i
was
not
aware
the
gentleman
they
accuse
of
insanity
is
just
being
examined
for
high
honours
in
the
university
of
aside
to
compton
and
if
he
does
come
you
may
give
them
the
well
said
the
judge
of
course
he
will
be
here
before
you
close
your
on
this
the
three
heads
clashed
again
and
serjeant
saunders
for
the
defendant
popped
up
and
said
with
great
politeness
and
affectation
of
sympathy
my
lud
i
can
quite
understand
my
learned
friend
hesitation
to
produce
his
principal
you
understand
nothing
about
the
matter
said
colt
cavalierly
call
harrington
was
alfred
tutor
at
eton
and
deposed
to
his
sanity
there
he
was
not
after
him
they
went
on
step
by
step
with
a
fresh
witness
for
every
six
months
till
they
brought
him
close
to
the
date
of
his
incarceration
then
they
put
in
one
of
witnesses
peterson
who
swore
alfred
had
talked
to
him
like
a
sane
person
that
very
morning
and
repeated
what
had
passed
only
elicited
that
he
and
alfred
were
no
longer
good
friends
which
rather
strengthened
the
evidence
then
giles
and
hannah
now
man
and
wife
were
called
and
swore
he
was
sane
all
the
time
he
was
at
silverton
house
saunders
diminished
the
effect
by
eliciting
that
they
had
left
on
bad
terms
with
baker
and
that
alfred
had
given
them
money
since
but
this
was
half
cured
on
by
being
set
down
to
gratitude
on
alfred
part
and
now
the
judge
went
to
luncheon
and
in
came
a
telegraphic
message
to
say
alfred
was
in
the
fast
train
coming
up
this
was
good
news
and
bad
they
had
hoped
he
would
drop
in
before
they
were
approaching
that
period
of
the
case
when
not
to
call
the
plaintiff
must
produce
a
vile
impression
the
judge
out
of
good
nature
i
suspect
was
longer
at
luncheon
than
usual
and
every
minute
was
so
much
gained
to
compton
and
julia
who
were
in
a
miserable
state
of
anxiety
yet
it
was
equalled
by
richard
hardie
who
never
entered
the
court
but
paced
the
hall
the
livelong
day
to
intercept
noah
skinner
and
when
i
tell
you
that
julia
had
consulted
green
and
that
he
had
instantly
pronounced
barkington
to
be
a
man
from
barkington
who
knew
the
truth
about
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
and
that
the
said
green
and
his
myrmidons
were
hunting
barkington
like
beagles
you
will
see
that
hardie
was
no
vain
terror
at
last
the
judge
returned
and
colt
was
obliged
to
put
in
his
reserves
so
called
sampson
instantly
a
very
dull
trial
became
an
amusing
one
the
scorn
with
which
he
treated
the
opinion
of
wycherley
and
speers
and
medical
certificates
in
general
was
so
droll
coming
from
a
doctor
and
so
racily
expressed
that
the
court
was
convulsed
also
in
by
saunders
he
sparred
away
in
such
gallant
style
with
that
accomplished
advocate
that
it
was
mighty
refreshing
the
judge
put
in
a
few
intelligent
questions
after
counsel
had
done
and
surprised
all
the
doctors
in
court
with
these
words
i
am
aware
sir
that
you
were
the
main
instrument
in
putting
down
bloodletting
in
this
what
made
sampson
evidence
particularly
strong
was
that
he
had
seen
the
plaintiff
the
evening
before
his
imprisonment
at
this
moment
three
men
all
of
them
known
to
the
reader
entered
the
court
one
was
our
old
acquaintance
fullalove
another
was
of
course
vespasian
and
the
third
was
the
missing
plaintiff
a
buzz
announced
his
arrival
and
expectation
rose
high
colt
called
him
with
admirably
feigned
nonchalance
he
stepped
into
the
box
and
there
was
a
murmur
of
surprise
and
admiration
at
his
bright
countenance
and
manly
bearing
of
course
to
give
his
evidence
would
be
to
write
hard
cash
over
again
it
is
enough
to
say
that
his
examination
in
chief
lasted
all
that
day
and
an
hour
of
the
next
colt
took
him
into
the
asylum
and
made
him
say
what
he
had
suffered
there
to
swell
the
damages
the
main
points
his
examination
in
chief
established
were
his
sanity
during
his
whole
life
the
money
settled
on
him
the
means
the
doctors
took
to
irritate
him
and
then
sign
him
excited
the
subserviency
of
his
uncle
to
his
father
the
double
motive
his
father
had
in
getting
him
imprisoned
the
business
of
the
when
colt
sat
down
at
eleven
on
the
second
day
the
jury
looked
indignant
and
the
judge
looked
very
grave
and
the
case
very
black
saunders
electrified
his
attorney
by
saying
my
advice
is
heathfield
implored
him
not
to
take
so
strange
a
course
on
this
saunders
shrugged
his
shoulders
rose
and
alfred
about
the
vision
of
one
captain
dodd
he
had
seen
and
about
his
suspicions
of
his
father
had
not
richard
hardie
always
been
a
kind
and
liberal
father
to
this
he
assented
had
he
not
sacrificed
a
large
fortune
to
his
creditors
plaintiff
believed
so
on
reflection
then
did
not
plaintiff
think
he
must
have
been
under
an
illusion
no
he
had
gone
by
direct
evidence
confining
himself
sagaciously
to
this
one
question
and
exerting
all
his
skill
and
pertinacity
saunders
succeeded
in
convincing
the
court
that
the
hard
cash
was
a
myth
a
pure
chimera
the
defendant
case
looked
up
for
there
are
many
intelligent
madmen
with
a
single
illusion
the
was
of
course
very
short
but
telling
for
alfred
swore
that
miss
julia
dodd
had
helped
him
to
carry
home
the
phantom
of
her
father
and
that
miss
dodd
had
a
letter
from
her
father
to
say
that
he
was
about
to
sail
with
the
other
phantom
the
here
saunders
interposed
and
said
that
evidence
was
inadmissible
let
him
call
miss
dodd
how
do
you
know
i
not
going
to
call
her
if
you
are
it
is
superfluous
if
not
it
is
inadmissible
compton
cast
an
inquiring
glance
up
at
a
certain
gallery
a
beautiful
girl
bowed
her
head
in
reply
with
a
warm
blush
and
such
a
flash
of
her
eye
and
colt
said
as
my
learned
friend
was
afraid
to
the
plaintiff
on
any
point
but
this
and
as
i
mean
to
respond
to
his
challenge
and
call
miss
dodd
i
will
not
trouble
the
plaintiff
any
through
the
whole
ordeal
alfred
showed
a
certain
flavour
of
eton
and
oxford
that
won
all
hearts
his
replies
were
frank
and
honest
and
under
he
was
no
more
to
be
irritated
than
if
saunders
had
been
harrow
bowling
at
him
or
the
robin
sparring
with
him
the
serjeant
who
was
a
gentleman
indicated
some
little
regret
at
the
possible
annoyance
he
was
causing
him
alfred
replied
with
a
grand
air
of
good
fellowship
do
not
think
so
poorly
of
me
as
to
suppose
i
feel
aggrieved
because
you
are
an
able
advocate
and
do
your
duty
to
your
client
that
is
very
handsomely
said
i
am
afraid
you
have
got
an
awkward
customer
in
a
case
of
this
kind
brother
saunders
it
is
not
for
want
of
brains
he
is
mad
my
lord
that
is
a
comfort
any
way
laughter
when
counsel
had
done
with
him
the
judge
used
his
right
and
put
several
shrewd
and
unusual
questions
to
him
asked
him
to
define
insanity
he
said
he
could
only
do
it
by
examples
and
he
abridged
several
intelligent
madmen
their
words
and
ways
and
contrasted
them
with
the
five
or
six
sane
people
he
had
fallen
in
with
in
asylums
showing
his
lordship
plainly
that
could
tell
any
insane
person
whatever
from
a
sane
one
and
this
was
the
most
remarkable
part
of
the
trial
to
see
this
shrewd
old
judge
extracting
from
a
real
observer
and
logical
thinker
those
positive
indicia
of
sanity
and
insanity
which
exist
but
which
no
lawyer
has
ever
yet
been
able
to
extract
from
any
psychological
physician
in
the
at
last
he
was
relieved
and
sat
sucking
an
orange
among
the
spectators
for
they
had
parched
his
throat
amongst
them
i
promise
you
julia
dodd
entered
the
box
and
a
sunbeam
seemed
to
fill
the
court
she
knew
what
to
do
her
left
hand
was
gloved
but
her
white
right
hand
bare
she
kissed
the
book
and
gave
her
evidence
in
her
clear
mellow
melting
voice
gave
it
reverently
and
modestly
for
to
her
the
court
was
a
church
she
said
how
long
she
had
been
acquainted
with
alfred
and
how
his
father
was
adverse
and
her
mother
had
thought
it
was
because
they
did
not
pass
for
rich
and
had
told
her
they
were
rich
and
with
this
she
produced
david
letter
and
she
also
swore
to
having
met
alfred
and
others
carrying
her
father
in
a
swoon
from
his
father
very
door
she
deposed
to
alfred
sanity
on
her
wedding
eve
and
on
the
day
his
recapture
was
attempted
saunders
against
his
own
judgment
was
instructed
to
her
and
without
meaning
it
he
put
a
question
which
gave
her
deep
distress
are
you
now
engaged
to
the
plaintiff
she
looked
timidly
round
and
saw
alfred
and
hesitated
the
serjeant
pressed
her
politely
but
firmly
must
i
reply
to
that
she
said
piteously
if
you
then
no
another
misfortune
has
now
separated
him
and
me
for
what
is
that
pray
my
father
is
said
to
have
died
at
sea
and
my
mother
thinks
is
to
judge
to
what
on
earth
has
this
to
do
with
hardie
against
hardie
you
are
warmly
interested
in
the
plaintiff
success
oh
yes
sir
aside
to
garrow
the
fool
is
putting
his
foot
into
it
not
a
jury
in
england
that
would
give
a
verdict
to
part
two
interesting
young
lovers
you
are
attached
to
him
ah
that
i
do
this
burst
intended
for
poor
alfred
not
the
court
baffled
and
grammar
and
everything
else
saunders
was
wise
and
generous
and
said
no
more
colt
cast
a
glance
of
triumph
and
declined
to
he
always
let
well
alone
the
judge
however
evinced
a
desire
to
trace
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
from
calcutta
but
julia
could
not
help
him
that
mysterious
sum
had
been
announced
by
letter
as
about
to
sail
and
then
no
more
was
heard
about
it
till
alfred
accused
his
father
of
having
it
all
endeavours
to
fill
this
hiatus
failed
however
julia
observing
that
in
courts
material
objects
affect
the
mind
most
had
provided
herself
with
all
the
de
she
could
find
and
she
produced
her
father
empty
and
said
when
he
was
brought
home
senseless
this
was
in
his
hand
it
up
to
me
said
the
judge
he
examined
it
and
said
it
had
been
in
the
water
captain
dodd
was
wrecked
off
the
french
coast
suggested
saunders
my
learned
friend
had
better
go
into
the
if
he
means
to
give
evidence
said
colt
you
are
very
much
afraid
of
a
very
little
truth
retorted
saunders
the
judge
stopped
this
sham
rencontre
by
asking
the
witness
whether
her
father
had
been
wrecked
she
said
and
that
is
how
the
money
was
lost
persisted
saunders
possibly
said
the
judge
i
darned
if
it
was
said
joshua
fullalove
composedly
instantly
all
heads
were
turned
in
amazement
at
this
audacious
interruption
to
the
soporific
decorum
of
an
english
court
the
transatlantic
citizen
received
this
battery
of
eyes
with
complete
imperturbability
roared
the
crier
awaking
from
a
nap
with
an
instinct
that
something
unusual
had
happened
but
the
shrewd
old
judge
had
caught
the
sincerity
with
which
the
words
were
uttered
and
put
on
his
spectacles
to
examine
the
speaker
are
you
for
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
i
do
know
either
of
from
adam
my
lord
but
i
know
captain
dodd
by
the
indeed
you
had
better
call
this
witness
your
lordship
must
excuse
me
i
am
quite
content
with
my
evidence
said
the
wary
advocate
well
then
i
shall
call
him
as
curiae
and
the
counsel
can
fullalove
went
into
the
box
was
sworn
identified
the
and
swore
he
had
seen
fourteen
thousand
pounds
in
it
on
two
occasions
with
very
little
prompting
he
told
the
and
the
indian
attempt
to
steal
the
money
and
pointed
out
vespasian
as
the
rival
darkie
who
had
baffled
the
attempt
then
he
told
the
shipwreck
to
an
audience
now
breathless
and
imagine
the
astonished
interest
with
which
julia
and
edward
listened
to
this
stranger
telling
them
the
new
strange
story
of
their
own
father
and
lastly
the
attempt
of
the
two
french
wreckers
and
assassins
and
how
it
had
been
baffled
and
so
the
mythical
cash
was
tracked
to
boulogne
the
judge
then
put
this
question
did
captain
dodd
tell
you
what
he
intended
to

and

like
an
enlightened
citizen
do
you
think
i
am

this
vespasian
and
fullalove
proceeded
to
change
places
amidst
roars
of
laughter
at
the
cool
way
this
pair
arranged
forensicalities
but
serjeant
saunders
requested
fullalove
to
stay
where
he
was
pray
sir
said
he
slowly
who
retained
you
for
a
witness
in
this
cause
fullalove
looked
puzzled
of
course
somebody
asked
you
to
drop
in
here
so
very
accidentally

now
who
was
it
i
god
almighty

dropped
from
the
clouds

with
pison

my
dander
and
i
tell

have
undertaken
to
educate

yar
darkie
here
he
stretched
out
a
long
arm
and
laid
his
hand
on
vespasian
woolly
pate
and
bound
to
raise
him
to
the
laughter
so
i
said
to
him
coming
over
westminster
bridge
there
a
store
hyar
where
they
sell
a
very
extraordinary
fixin
and
it
called
justice
they
sell
it
tarnation
dear
prime
so
i
make
tracks
for
the
very
court
where
i
got
the
prime
article
three
years
ago
against
a
varmint
that
was
breaking
the
seventh
and
eighth
commandments
over
me
adulterating
my
patent
and
then
stealing
it
blast
him
a
roar
of
laughter
and
coming
along
i
said
this
old
country
got
some
good
pints
after
all
old
hoss
one
is
they
sell

other
is
hyar
darkies

free
as
air
disenthralled
by
the
univarsal
genius
of
british
liberty
and
then
i
pitched
counsellor
curran
bunkum
into
this
darkie
and
he
sucked
it
in
like
mother
milk
and
in
we
came
on
tiptoe
and
the
first
thing
we
heard
was
a
freeborn
briton
treated
wus
than
ever
a
nigger
in
old
kentuck
decoyed
away
from
his
gal
shoved
into
a
darned
madhouse
the
darbies
clapped
on
him
we
do
want
your
comments
on
the
case
no
nor
any
other
free
and
enlightened
citizen
i
reckon
wal
vespasian
and
me
sat
like
mice
in
a
snowdrift
and
hid
our
feelings
out
of
good
manners
being
strangers
till
his
lordship
got
fixed
about
the
captain
says
i
this
hurts
my
feelings
powerful
says
i
this
hyar
lord
did
the
right
thing
about
my
patent
he
summed
up
just
and
now
he
is
in
an
everlasting
fix
himself
one
good
turn
deserves
another
i
get
him
out
of
this
fix
any
here
the
witness
was
interrupted
with
a
roar
of
laughter
that
shook
the
court
even
the
judge
leaned
back
and
chuckled
genially
though
quietly
and
right
sorrowful
was
every
briton
there
when
saunders
closed
abruptly
the
of
joshua
fullalove
his
lordship
then
said
he
wished
to
ask
vespasian
a
question
saunders
lost
patience
what
another
curiae
my
lud
this
is
excuse
my
curiosity
brother
saunders
said
the
judge
ironically
i
wish
to
trace
this
as
far
as
possible
have
you
any
particular
objection
to
the
truth
on
this
head
of
evidence
no
my
lud
i
never
urge
objections

then
you
are
a
wise
to
vespasian
after
he
had
been
sworn

did
captain
dodd
tell
you
what
he
intended
to
do
with
this
money

massa

massa
captan

and
dis
child
heerd
him
yah
the
plaintiff
case
being
apparently
concluded
the
judge
retired
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
buzz
that
followed
a
note
was
handed
to
compton
skinner
on
a
hot
scent
sure
to
find
him
he
is
wanted
by
another
party
there
is
something
curious
compton
wrote
on
a
slip
for
heaven
sake
bring
him
directly
in
half
an
hour
it
will
be
too
green
hurried
out
and
nearly
ran
against
richard
hardie
who
was
moodily
pacing
westminster
hall
at
the
climax
of
his
own
anxiety
to
him
all
turned
on
skinner
five
minutes
passed
ten
fifteen
twenty
all
the
plaintiff
party
had
their
eyes
on
the
door
but
green
did
not
return
and
the
judge
did
then
to
gain
a
few
minutes
more
colt
instructed
by
compton
rose
and
said
with
great
solemnity
we
are
about
to
call
our
last
witness
the
living
have
testified
to
my
sanity
and
now
we
shall
read
you
the
testimony
of
the
that
i
object
to
of
course
does
my
learned
friend
mean
to
say
he
objects
at
random
nothing
of
the
kind
i
object
on
the
law
of
evidence
a
matter
on
which
my
learned
friend
seems
to
be
under
a
hallucination
as
complete
as
his
client
about
that
there
none
ever
feared
that
the
truth
should
be
heard
but
they
whom
the
truth
would
indict
a
court
of
justice
is
not
the
place
for
old
songs
and
new
law
really
my
learned
friend
is
the
objective
case
incarnate
to
i
ca
keep
this
nonsense
up
for
ever
is
skinner
come
he
has
a
mania
for
objection
and
with
your
lordship
permission
i
buy
a
couple
of
doctors
and
lock
him
up
in
an
asylum
as
he
leaves
the
court
this
afternoon
laughter
a
very
good
plan
then
you
no
longer
feel
the
weight
of
his
abilities
i
conclude
colt
you
intend
to
call
a
witness
who
will
swear
to
the
deceased
person
and
that
it
was
written
in
the
knowledge
death
was
at
hand
certainly
my
lord
i
can
call
miss
julia
dodd
that
i
need
not
take
the
trouble
of
objecting
to
with
some
surprise
no
colt
that
will
never
do
you
have
examined
her
and
her
i
need
hardly
say
colt
knew
very
well
he
could
not
call
julia
dodd
but
he
was
fighting
for
seconds
now
to
get
in
skinner
call
edward
edward
was
sworn
and
asked
if
he
knew
the
late
jane
hardie
i
knew
her
well
said
he
is
that
her
handwriting
it
where
was
it
written
in
my
mother
house
at
under
what
circumstances
she
was
dying
of
a
blow
given
her
by
a
maniac
called
maxley
said
the
judge
to
counsel
i
remember
the
queen
maxley
i
tried
him
myself
at
the
assizes
it
was
for
striking
a
young
lady
with
a
bludgeon
of
which
she
died
maxley
was
powerfully
defended
and
it
was
proved
that
his
wife
had
died
and
he
had
been
driven
mad
for
a
time
by
her
father
bank
breaking
the
jury
bring
in
a
verdict
that
was
no
verdict
at
all
as
i
took
the
liberty
to
tell
them
at
the
time
the
judges
dismissed
it
and
maxley
was
eventually
no
doubt
that
was
the
case
my
lord
to
the
did
jane
hardie
know
she
was
dying
oh
yes
sir
she
told
us
all
to
whom
did
she
give
this
letter
to
my
oh
to
your
sister
to
miss
julia
dodd
yes
sir
but
not
for
herself
it
was
to
give
to
alfred
can
you
read
the
letter
it
is
rather
faintly
written
it
is
written
in
pencil
my
i
read
it
sir
but
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
she
that
wrote
it
was
very
very
dear
to
the
young
man
full
voice
faltered
as
he
uttered
these
words
and
he
turned
his
eyes
soft
and
imploring
on
the
judge
that
venerable
and
shrewd
old
man
learned
in
human
nature
as
well
as
in
law
comprehended
in
a
moment
and
said
kindly
you
misunderstand
him
witnesses
do
not
read
letters
in
court
let
the
letter
be
handed
up
to
this
was
fortunate
for
the
court
cuckoo
who
intones
most
letters
would
have
read
all
the
sense
and
pathos
out
of
this
with
his
monotonous
the
judge
read
it
carefully
to
himself
with
his
glasses
and
told
the
jury
it
seemed
a
genuine
document
then
the
crier
cried
silence
in
the
court
and
his
lordship
turned
towards
the
jury
and
read
the
letter
slowly
and
solemnly
dear
dear
brother
your
poor
little
jane
lies
dying
suddenly
but
not
painfully
and
my
last
earthly
thoughts
are
for
my
darling
brother
some
wicked
person
has
said
you
are
insane
i
deny
this
with
my
dying
breath
and
my
dying
hand
you
came
to
me
the
night
before
the
wedding
that
was
to
be
and
talked
to
me
most
calmly
rationally
and
kindly
so
that
i
could
not
resist
your
reasons
and
went
to
your
wedding
which
till
then
i
did
not
intend
show
these
words
to
your
slanderers
when
i
am
no
more
but
oh
alfred
even
this
is
of
little
moment
compared
with
the
world
to
come
by
all
our
affection
grant
me
one
request
battered
wounded
dying
in
my
prime
what
would
be
my
condition
but
for
the
saviour
whom
i
have
loved
and
with
whom
i
hope
soon
to
be
he
smoothes
the
bed
of
death
for
me
he
lights
the
dark
valley
i
rejoice
to
die
and
be
with
him
oh
turn
to
him
dear
brother
without
one
hour
delay
and
then
how
short
will
be
this
parting
this
is
your
dying
sister
one
request
who
loves
you
with
the
exception
of
julia
sobs
not
a
sound
was
heard
as
the
judge
read
it
many
eyes
were
wet
and
the
judge
himself
was
visibly
affected
and
pressed
his
handkerchief
a
moment
to
his
eyes
these
are
the
words
of
a
christian
woman
gentlemen
he
said
and
there
was
silence
a
girl
hand
seemed
to
have
risen
from
the
grave
to
defend
her
brother
and
rend
the
veil
from
falsehood
colt
out
of
pure
tact
subdued
his
voice
to
the
key
of
the
sentiment
thus
awakened
and
said
impressively
gentlemen
of
the
jury
that
is
our
case
and
so
sat
down
chapter
liii
sergeant
saunders
thought
it
prudent
to
let
the
emotion
subside
before
opening
the
defendant
case
so
he
disarranged
his
papers
and
then
rearranged
them
as
before
and
during
this
a
person
employed
by
richard
hardie
went
out
and
told
him
this
last
untoward
piece
of
evidence
he
winced
but
all
was
overbalanced
by
this
that
skinner
had
not
come
to
bear
witness
for
the
plaintiff
sergeant
saunders
rose
with
perfect
dignity
and
confidence
and
delivered
a
masterly
address
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
whole
affair
took
another
colour
under
that
plausible
tongue
the
tactician
began
by
declaring
that
the
plaintiff
was
perfectly
sane
and
his
convalescence
was
a
matter
of
such
joy
to
the
defendant
that
not
even
the
cruel
misinterpretation
of
facts
and
motives
to
which
his
amiable
client
had
been
exposed
could
rob
him
of
that
sacred
delight
our
case
gentlemen
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
sane
and
that
he
owes
his
sanity
to
those
prompt
wise
and
benevolent
measures
which
we
took
eighteen
months
ago
at
an
unhappy
crisis
of
his
mind
to
preserve
his
understanding
and
his
property
yes
his
property
gentlemen
that
property
which
in
a
paroxysm
of
mania
he
was
going
to
throw
away
as
i
shall
show
you
by
an
unanswerable
document
he
comes
here
to
slander
us
and
mulet
us
out
of
five
thousand
pounds
but
i
shall
show
you
he
is
already
ten
thousand
pounds
the
richer
for
that
act
of
ours
for
which
he
debits
us
five
thousand
pounds
instead
of
crediting
us
twice
the
sum
gentlemen
i
can
not
like
my
learned
friend
call
witnesses
from
the
clouds
from
the
united
states
and
from
the
grave
for
it
has
not
occurred
to
my
client
strong
in
the
sense
of
his
kindly
and
honourable
intentions
to
engage
gentlemen
from
foreign
parts
with
woolly
locks
and
nasal
twangs
to
drop
in
accidentally
and
eke
out
the
fatal
gaps
in
evidence
the
class
of
testimony
we
stand
upon
is
less
romantic
it
does
not
seduce
the
imagination
nor
play
upon
the
passions
but
it
is
of
a
much
higher
character
in
sober
men
eyes
especially
in
a
court
of
law
i
rely
not
on
witnesses
dropped
from
the
clouds
and
the
stars
and
the
stripes
to
order
nor
even
on
the
prejudiced
statements
of
friends
and
sweethearts
who
always
swear
from
the
heart
rather
than
from
the
head
and
the
conscience
but
on
the
calm
testimony
of
indifferent
men
and
on
written
documents
furnished
by
the
plaintiff
and
on
contemporaneous
entries
in
the
books
of
the
asylum
which
entries
formally
describe
the
acts
and
were
put
down
at
the
time
at
the
time
gentlemen
with
no
idea
of
a
trial
at
law
to
come
but
in
compliance
with
the
very
proper
provisions
of
a
wise
and
salutary
act
i
shall
also
lay
before
you
the
evidence
of
the
medical
witnesses
who
signed
the
certificates
men
of
probity
and
honour
and
who
have
made
these
subtle
maladies
of
the
mind
the
special
study
of
their
whole
life
i
shall
also
call
the
family
doctor
who
has
known
the
plaintiff
and
his
ailments
bodily
and
mental
for
many
years
and
communicated
his
suspicions
to
one
of
the
first
psychological
physicians
of
the
age
declining
with
a
modesty
which
we
who
know
less
of
insanity
than
he
does
would
do
well
to
imitate
declining
i
say
to
pronounce
a
positive
opinion
unfavourable
to
the
plaintiff
till
he
should
have
compared
notes
with
this
learned
man
and
profited
by
his
vast
in
this
strain
he
continued
for
a
good
hour
until
the
defendants
case
seemed
to
be
a
thing
of
granite
his
oration
ended
he
called
a
string
of
witnesses
every
one
of
whom
bore
the
learned
counsel
out
by
his
evidence
in
chief
but
here
came
the
grand
distinction
between
the
defendants
case
and
the
plaintiff
had
hardly
shaken
the
witnesses
it
literally
dissolved
the
defendant
osmond
was
called
and
proved
alfred
headaches
and
pallor
and
his
own
suspicions
but
then
colt
forced
him
to
admit
that
many
young
people
had
headaches
without
going
mad
and
were
pale
when
thwarted
in
love
without
going
mad
and
that
as
to
the
and
the
phantom
he
nothing
but
had
taken
all
that
for
granted
on
richard
hardie
word
wycherley
deposed
to
alfred
being
insane
and
abnormally
irritable
and
under
a
pecuniary
illusion
as
stated
in
his
certificate
and
to
his
own
vast
experience
but
the
fire
of
melted
all
his
polysyllables
into
guesswork
and
hearsay
it
melted
out
of
him
that
he
a
stranger
had
intruded
on
the
young
man
privacy
and
had
burst
into
a
most
delicate
topic
his
disagreement
with
his
father
and
so
had
himself
created
the
very
irritation
he
had
set
down
to
madness
he
also
had
to
admit
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
or
the
phantom
but
had
taken
for
granted
the
young
man
own
father
who
consulted
him
was
not
telling
him
a
deliberate
and
wicked
falsehood
in
short
sir
you
were
retained
to
make
the
man
out
insane
just
as
my
learned
friend
there
is
retained
i
think
sir
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
my
profession
to
notice
that
comparison
i
leave
defendant
counsel
to
thank
you
for
that
come
never
mind
let
us
have
a
little
is
it
consistent
with
your
dignity
to
tell
us
whether
the
keepers
of
private
asylums
pay
you
a
commission
for
all
the
patients
you
consign
to
durance
vile
by
your
certificates
wycherley
fenced
with
this
question
but
the
remorseless
colt
only
kept
him
longer
under
torture
and
dragged
out
of
him
that
he
received
fifteen
per
cent
from
the
asylum
keepers
for
every
patient
he
wrote
insane
and
that
he
had
an
income
of
eight
hundred
pounds
a
year
from
that
source
alone
this
of
course
was
the
very
thing
to
prejudice
a
jury
against
the
defence
and
colt
art
was
to
keep
to
their
level
speers
failed
to
conceal
that
he
was
a
mere
tool
of
wycherley
and
had
signed
in
manifest
collusion
adhering
to
the
letter
of
the
statute
but
violating
its
spirit
for
certainly
the
act
never
intended
by
separate
examination
that
two
doctors
should
come
into
the
passage
and
walk
into
the
room
alternately
then
reunite
and
do
the
signing
as
agreed
before
they
ever
saw
the
patient
as
to
the
illusion
about
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
speers
owned
that
the
plaintiff
had
not
uttered
a
word
about
the
subject
but
had
peremptorily
declined
it
he
had
to
confess
too
that
he
had
taken
for
granted
wycherley
was
correctly
informed
about
the
said
illusion
in
short
said
the
judge
interposing
dr
wycherley
took
the
very
thing
for
granted
which
it
was
his
duty
to
ascertain
and
you
sir
not
to
be
behind
wycherley
took
the
thing
for
granted
at
second
and
when
speers
had
left
the
box
he
said
to
serjeant
saunders
if
this
case
is
to
be
defended
seriously
you
had
better
call
richard
hardie
without
further
it
is
my
wish
my
lud
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
is
in
the
country
very
ill
and
i
have
no
hope
of
seeing
him
here
before
oh
well
so
that
you
call
him
i
shall
not
lay
hearsay
before
the
jury
hearsay
gathered
from
richard
hardie
whom
you
will
call
in
person
if
the
reports
he
has
circulated
have
any
basis
whatever
in
saunders
said
coolly
mr
richard
hardie
is
not
the
defendant
and
flowed
on
nor
would
any
but
a
lawyer
have
suspected
what
a
terrible
stab
the
judge
had
given
him
so
quietly
the
surgeon
of
silverton
house
was
then
sworn
and
produced
the
case
book
and
there
stood
the
entries
which
had
been
so
fatal
to
alfred
with
the
visiting
justices
suicide
homicide
but
the
plaintiff
got
to
colt
with
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
he
had
written
his
view
of
all
this
and
dissolved
the
suicide
and
homicide
into
a
spirited
attempt
to
escape
and
resist
a
false
imprisonment
as
for
the
colt
elicited
that
alfred
had
eaten
at
six
though
not
at
two
and
pray
sir
said
he
contemptuously
to
the
witness
do
you
never
stir
out
of
a
madhouse
do
you
imagine
that
gentlemen
in
their
senses
dine
at
two
in
the
nineteenth
century
no
i
do
say
what
you
say
then
is
forcible
imprisonment
of
a
bridegroom
in
a
madhouse
the
thing
to
give
a
a
appetite
at
barbarous
in
a
word
colt
was
rough
with
this
witness
and
nearly
smashed
him
saunders
fought
gallantly
on
and
put
in
lawyer
crawford
with
his
draft
of
the
insane
deed
as
he
called
it
by
which
the
erotic
monomaniac
alfred
divested
himself
of
all
his
money
in
favour
of
the
dodds
there
was
no
dissolving
this
deed
away
and
crawford
swore
he
had
entreated
the
plaintiff
not
to
insist
on
his
drawing
so
a
document
but
opposition
or
question
seemed
to
irritate
his
client
so
that
he
had
complied
and
the
deed
was
to
have
been
signed
on
the
all
the
lawyers
present
thought
this
looked
really
mad
fancy
a
man
signing
away
his
property
to
his
wife
relatives
the
court
which
had
already
sat
long
beyond
the
usual
time
broke
up
leaving
the
defendant
with
this
advantage
alfred
hardie
and
his
friends
made
a
little
knot
in
the
hall
outside
and
talked
excitedly
over
the
incidents
of
the
trial
compton
introduced
fullalove
and
vespasian
they
all
shook
hands
with
them
and
thanked
them
warmly
for
the
timely
and
most
unexpected
aid
but
green
and
a
myrmidon
broke
in
upon
their
conversation
i
am
down
on
barkington
noah
skinner
it
is
very
far
from
here
if
you
will
follow
green
was
as
excited
as
a
foxhound
when
pug
has
begun
to
trail
his
brush
the
more
so
that
another
client
of
his
wanted
noah
skinner
and
so
the
detective
was
doing
a
double
stroke
of
business
he
led
the
way
it
was
dry
and
they
all
went
in
pairs
after
him
into
the
back
slums
of
westminster
and
a
pretty
part
that
is
now
as
they
went
along
alfred
hung
behind
with
julia
and
asked
her
what
on
earth
she
meant
by
swearing
that
it
was
all
over
between
her
and
him
why
your
last
letter
was
full
of
love
dearest
what
could
you
be
thinking
of
to
say
that
she
shook
her
head
sadly
and
revealed
to
him
with
many
prayers
for
forgiveness
that
she
had
been
playing
a
part
of
late
that
she
had
concealed
her
father
death
from
him
and
the
fatal
barrier
interposed
i
was
afraid
you
would
be
disheartened
and
lose
your
first
class
and
perhaps
your
trial
but
you
are
safe
now
dear
alfred
i
am
sure
the
judge
sees
through
them
for
i
have
studied
him
for
you
i
know
his
face
by
heart
and
all
his
looks
and
what
they
mean
my
alfred
will
be
cleared
of
this
wicked
slander
and
happy
with
some
one
ah
yes
i
mean
to
be
happy
with
some
one
said
alfred
i
am
not
one
of
your
angels
thank
heaven
your
shall
not
sacrifice
us
to
your
mother
injustice
nor
to
the
caprices
of
fate
we
have
one
another
but
you
would
immolate
me
for
the
pleasure
of
immolating
yourself
do
provoke
me
too
far
or
i
carry
you
off
by
force
i
swear
it
by
him
who
made
us
dearest
how
wildly
you
and
with
this
julia
hung
her
head
and
had
a
guilty
thrill
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
eccentric
little
measure
would
relieve
her
of
the
sin
of
disobedience
after
making
known
to
her
his
desperate
resolution
alfred
was
silent
and
they
went
sadly
side
by
side
so
dear
so
near
yet
always
some
infernal
thing
or
other
coming
between
them
they
reached
a
passage
in
a
miserable
street
at
the
mouth
stood
two
of
green
men
planted
there
to
follow
skinner
should
he
go
out
but
they
reported
all
quiet
bring
the
old
gentleman
up
said
green
i
appointed
him
six
and
it
on
the
he
then
descended
the
passage
and
striking
a
light
led
the
way
up
a
high
stair
skinner
lived
on
the
fifth
story
green
tapped
at
his
door
mr
no
reply
mr
barkington
i
brought
you
some
no
reply
perhaps
he
is
not
at
home
said
compton
oh
yes
sir
i
sent
a
sharp
boy
up
and
he
picked
the
paper
out
of
the
keyhole
and
saw
him
sitting
he
then
applied
his
own
eye
to
the
keyhole
i
see
something
black
said
he
i
think
he
while
he
hesitated
they
became
conscious
of
a
pungent
vapour
stealing
through
the
now
open
keyhole
hallo
said
green
what
is
this
fullalove
observed
coolly
that
skinner
lungs
must
be
peculiarly
made
if
he
could
breathe
in
that
atmosphere
if
you
want
to
see
him
alive
let
me
open
the
there
something
amiss
here
said
green
gravely
at
that
fullalove
whipped
out
a
tool
no
bigger
than
a
nutcracker
forced
the
edge
in
and
sent
the
door
flying
open
the
room
or
den
was
full
of
an
acrid
vapour
and
close
to
them
sat
he
they
sought
motionless
keep
the
lady
back
cried
green
and
threw
the
vivid
light
of
his
bull
eye
on
a
strange
grotesque
and
ghastly
scene
the
floor
was
covered
with
bright
sovereigns
that
glittered
in
the
on
the
table
was
an
open
book
and
a
candle
quite
burnt
down
the
grease
had
run
into
a
circle
and
as
was
that
grease
to
the
expired
light
so
was
the
thing
that
sat
there
in
human
form
to
the
noah
skinner
they
had
come
to
seek
dead
this
many
a
day
of
charcoal
fumes
but
preserved
from
decomposition
by
those
very
fumes
sat
noah
skinner
dried
into
bones
and
leather
waiting
for
them
with
his
own
hard
cash
and
with
theirs
for
creeping
awestruck
round
that
mummified
figure
seated
dead
on
his
pool
of
sovereigns
they
soon
noticed
in
his
left
hand
a
paper
it
was
discoloured
by
the
vapour
and
part
hid
by
the
dead
thumb
but
thus
much
shone
out
clear
and
amazing
that
it
was
a
banker
receipt
to
david
dodd
for
drawn
at
barkington
and
signed
for
richard
hardie
by
noah
skinner
julia
had
drawn
back
and
was
hiding
her
face
but
soon
curiosity
struggled
with
awe
in
the
others
they
peeped
at
the
receipt
they
touched
the
weird
figure
its
yellow
skin
sounded
like
a
drum
and
its
joints
creaked
like
a
puppets
at
last
compton
suggested
that
edward
dodd
ought
to
secure
that
valuable
document
no
no
said
edward
it
is
too
like
robbing
the
then
i
will
said
compton
but
he
found
the
dead
thumb
and
finger
would
not
part
with
the
receipt
then
as
a
trifle
turns
the
scale
he
hesitated
in
turn
and
all
but
julia
stood
motionless
round
the
body
that
held
the
receipt
the
soul
of
the
lost
cash
and
still
as
in
life
seemed
loth
to
part
with
it
then
fullalove
came
beside
the
and
said
with
simple
dignity
i
a
man
from
foreign
parts
i
have
no
interest
here
but
justice
and
justice
i
he
took
the
dead
arm
and
the
joint
creaked
he
applied
the
same
lever
to
the
bone
and
parchment
hand
he
had
to
the
door
it
creaked
too
but
more
faintly
and
opened
and
let
out
this
no
barkington
david
dodd
sum
of
fourteen
thousand
and
ten
pounds
twelve
shillings
and
six
pence
to
account
on
demand
richard
hardie
noah
skinner
a
stately
foot
came
up
the
stair
but
no
one
heard
it
all
were
absorbed
in
the
strange
weird
sight
and
this
great
stroke
of
fate
or
of
providence
this
is
yours
i
reckon
said
fullalove
and
handed
the
receipt
to
edward
no
no
said
compton
see
i
just
found
a
will
bequeathing
all
he
has
in
the
world
with
his
blessing
to
miss
julia
dodd
these
sovereigns
are
yours
then
but
above
all
the
paper
as
your
legal
adviser
i
insist
on
your
taking
it
immediately
possession
is
nine
points
however
it
is
actually
yours
in
virtue
of
this
a
solemn
passionless
voice
seemed
to
fall
on
them
from
the
clouds
no
it
is
my
story
must
now
return
on
board
the
just
before
noon
the
bell
the
half
hours
are
struck
on
was
tolled
to
collect
the
company
and
soon
the
gangways
and
booms
were
crowded
and
even
the
yards
were
manned
with
sailors
collected
to
see
their
shipmate
committed
to
the
deep
next
came
the
lieutenants
and
midshipmen
and
stood
reverently
on
the
deck
the
body
was
brought
and
placed
on
a
grating
then
all
heads
being
uncovered
below
and
aloft
the
chaplain
read
the
solemn
service
of
the
dead
many
tears
were
shied
by
the
rough
sailors
the
more
so
that
to
most
of
them
though
not
to
the
officers
it
was
now
known
that
poor
billy
had
not
always
been
before
the
mast
but
had
seen
better
days
and
commanded
vessels
and
saved
lives
and
now
he
had
lost
his
own
the
service
is
the
same
as
ashore
with
this
exception
that
the
words
we
commit
his
body
to
the
ground
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
are
altered
at
sea
thus
we
commit
his
body
to
the
deep
to
be
turned
into
corruption
looking
for
the
resurrection
of
the
body
when
the
sea
shall
give
up
her
dead
and
the
life
of
the
world
to
at
these
words
the
body
is
allowed
to
glide
off
the
grating
into
the
sea
the
chaplain
solemn
voice
drew
near
those
very
words
and
the
tears
of
pity
fell
faster
and
georgie
white
an
affectionate
boy
sobbed
violently
and
shivered
beforehand
at
the
sullen
plunge
that
he
knew
would
soon
come
and
then
he
should
see
no
more
poor
billy
who
had
given
his
life
for
his
at
this
moment
the
captain
came
flying
on
deck
and
jumping
on
to
a
gun
cried
sharply
avast
haul
that
body
the
sharp
voice
of
command
cut
across
the
solemn
words
and
tones
in
the
most
startling
way
the
chaplain
closed
his
book
with
a
look
of
amazement
and
indignation
the
sailors
stared
and
for
the
first
time
did
not
obey
an
order
to
be
sure
it
was
one
they
had
never
heard
before
then
the
captain
got
angry
and
repeated
his
command
louder
and
the
body
was
almost
jerked
in
board
carry
him
to
my
cabin
and
uncover
his
by
this
time
nothing
could
surprise
jackey
tar
four
sailors
executed
the
order
promptly
bosen
pipe
to
while
the
men
were
dispersing
to
their
several
stations
captain
bazalgette
apologised
to
the
chaplain
and
explained
to
him
and
to
the
officers
but
i
give
his
explanation
in
my
own
words
finding
the
ship
quiet
the
purser
went
to
the
captain
down
below
and
asked
him
coolly
what
entry
he
should
make
in
the
ship
books
about
this
william
thompson
who
was
no
more
william
thompson
than
he
was
what
do
you
mean
said
the
captain
then
the
purser
told
him
that
messmates
in
preparing
him
last
night
for
interment
had
found
a
little
bag
round
his
neck
and
inside
it
a
medal
of
the
humane
society
and
a
slip
of
paper
written
on
in
a
lady
hand
then
they
had
sent
for
him
and
he
had
seen
at
once
that
this
was
a
mysterious
case
this
lady
spoke
of
him
as
her
husband
and
skipper
of
a
merchant
vessel
what
is
that
roared
the
captain
who
hitherto
had
listened
with
scarce
half
an
ear
skipper
of
a
merchant
vessel
sir
as
sure
as
you
command
her
frigate
and
then
we
found
his
shirt
marked
with
the
same
name
as
the
what
was
the
lady
name
lucy
dodd
and
david
dodd
is
on
the
why
did
you
tell
me
this
before
cried
the
captain
did
know
it
till
last
why
it
is
twelve
they
are
burying
yes
lucy
would
never
forgive
me
cried
the
captain
and
to
the
utter
amazement
he
clapped
on
his
cocked
hat
and
flew
out
of
the
cabin
on
the
errand
i
have
described
he
now
returned
to
the
cabin
and
looked
a
glance
was
enough
there
lay
the
kindly
face
that
had
been
his
friend
man
and
boy
he
hid
his
own
with
his
hands
and
moaned
he
cursed
his
own
blindness
and
stupidity
in
not
recognising
that
face
among
a
thousand
in
this
he
was
unjust
to
himself
david
had
never
looked
till
now
he
sent
for
the
surgeon
and
told
him
the
whole
sad
story
and
asked
him
what
could
be
done
his
poor
cousin
lucy
had
more
than
once
expressed
her
horror
of
interment
at
sea
it
is
very
hot
said
he
but
surely
you
must
know
some
way
of
keeping
him
till
we
land
in
new
zealand
curse
these
flies
how
they
bite
the
surgeon
eyes
sparkled
he
happened
to
be
an
enthusiast
in
the
art
of
embalming
keep
him
to
new
zealand
said
he
contemptuously
embalm
him
so
that
he
shall
go
to
england
looking
just
as
he
does
now
i
never
saw
a
drowned
man
keep
his
colour
so
well
before
ay
and
two
thousand
years
after
that
if
you
do
mind
the
the
expense
i
do
care
if
it
cost
me
a
year
pay
i
think
of
nothing
but
repairing
my
blunder
as
far
as
i
the
surgeon
was
delighted
standing
over
his
subject
who
lay
on
the
captain
table
he
told
that
officer
how
he
should
proceed
i
have
all
the
syringes
he
said
a
capital
collection
i
shall
inject
the
veins

and
patience

viscera

and

but
do
it
i
must
write
and
tell
poor
lucy
i
have
got
him
and
am
bringing
him
home
to
her
the
surgeon
was
gone
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
then
returned
with
two
men
to
remove
the
body
and
found
the
captain
still
writing
his
letter
very
sorrowful
but
now
and
then
slapping
his
face
or
leg
with
a
hearty
curse
as
the
flies
stung
him
the
surgeon
beckoned
the
men
in
softly
and
pointed
to
the
body
for
them
to
carry
it
out
now
as
he
pointed
his
eye
following
his
finger
fell
on
something
that
struck
that
experienced
eye
as
incredible
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
so
loud
that
the
captain
looked
up
directly
from
his
letter
and
saw
him
standing
with
his
finger
pointing
at
the
corpse
and
his
eyes
staring
astonishment
what
now
said
the
captain
and
rose
from
his
seat
look
look
look
the
captain
came
and
looked
and
said
he
saw
nothing
at
all
the
fly
the
fly
cried
the
surgeon
yes
i
see
one
of
them
has
been
biting
him
for
there
a
little
blood
trickling
poor
a
dead
man
ca
bleed
from
the
small
veins
in
his
skin
said
the
man
of
art
he
is
alive
captain
he
is
alive
as
sure
as
we
stand
here
and
god
above
that
little
insect
was
wiser
than
us
he
is
jackson
do
trifle
with
me
or
i
hang
you
at
the
god
bless
you
jackson
is
it
really
possible
run
some
of
you
get
a
mirror
i
have
heard
that
is
a
mirror
be
hanged
doctor
fly
knows
his
all
was
now
flutter
and
bustle
and
various
attempts
were
made
to
resuscitate
david
but
all
in
vain
at
last
the
surgeon
had
an
idea
this
man
was
never
drowned
at
all
said
he
i
am
sure
of
it
this
is
catalepsy
he
may
lie
this
way
for
a
week
but
dead
he
is
not
try
the
david
was
then
by
his
orders
stripped
and
carried
to
a
place
where
they
could
turn
a
watercock
on
him
from
a
height
and
the
surgeon
had
soon
the
happiness
of
pointing
out
to
the
captain
a
slight
blush
on
david
skin
in
parts
caused
by
the
falling
water
all
doubts
ceased
with
this
the
only
fear
was
lest
they
should
shake
out
the
trembling
life
by
rough
usage
they
laid
him
on
his
stomach
and
with
a
bellows
and
pipe
so
acted
on
the
lungs
that
at
last
a
genuine
sigh
issued
from
the
patient
breast
then
they
put
him
in
a
warm
bed
and
applied
stimulants
and
by
slow
degrees
the
eyelids
began
to
wink
the
eyes
to
look
more
mellow
the
respiration
to
strengthen
the
heart
to
beat
patience
now
said
the
surgeon
patience
and
lots
of
patience
was
rewarded
just
four
hours
after
the
first
treatment
a
voice
faint
but
calm
and
genial
issued
from
the
bed
on
their
astonished
ears
good
morning
to
you
they
kept
very
quiet
in
about
five
minutes
more
the
voice
broke
out
again
calm
and
sonorous
where
is
my
money
my
fourteen
thousand
pounds
these
words
set
them
all
looking
at
one
another
and
very
much
puzzled
the
surgeon
they
were
delivered
with
such
sobriety
and
conviction
captain
he
whispered
ask
him
if
he
knows
david
said
the
captain
kindly
do
you
know
me
david
looked
at
him
earnestly
and
his
old
kindly
smile
broke
out
know
ye
ye
clog
said
he
why
you
are
my
cousin
reginald
and
how
came
you
into
this
thundering
bank
i
hope
you
have
got
no
money
here
land
sharks
we
are
not
in
a
bank
david
we
are
on
board
my
the
deuce
we
are
but
where
my
money
oh
we
talk
about
that
the
surgeon
stepped
forward
and
said
soothingly
you
have
been
very
ill
sir
you
have
had
a
i
believe
you
are
right
said
david
thoughtfully
will
you
allow
me
to
examine
your
eye
certainly
the
surgeon
examined
david
eye
with
his
thumb
and
finger
and
then
looked
into
it
to
see
how
the
pupil
dilated
and
contracted
he
rubbed
his
hands
after
this
examination
more
good
news
captain
then
lowering
his
voice
your
friend
is
as
sane
as
i
the
surgeon
was
right
a
shock
had
brought
back
the
reason
a
shock
had
taken
away
but
how
or
why
i
know
no
more
than
the
child
unborn
the
surgeon
wrote
a
learned
paper
and
explained
the
whole
most
ingeniously
i
do
believe
one
word
of
his
explanation
and
ca
better
it
so
confine
myself
to
the
phenomena
being
now
sane
the
boundary
wall
of
his
memory
was
shifted
he
remembered
his
whole
life
up
to
his
demanding
his
cash
back
of
richard
hardie
and
there
his
reawakened
mind
stopped
dead
short
being
asked
if
he
knew
william
thompson
he
said
yes
perfectly
he
was
a
foretopman
on
board
the
and
rather
a
smart
hand
the
ship
was
aground
and
breaking
up
he
went
out
to
sea
on
a
piano
but
we
cut
the
hawser
as
he
drifted
under
and
he
got
safe
david
recovered
reason
rejected
with
contempt
as
an
idle
dream
all
that
had
happened
while
that
reason
was
in
defect
the
last
phenomena
i
have
to
record
were
bodily
one
was
noted
by
georgie
white
in
these
terms
billy
eyes
used
to
be
like
a
seal
but
now
he
is
a
great
gentleman
they
are
like
yours
and
the
other
was
more
singular
with
his
recovered
reason
came
his
first
grey
hair
and
in
one
fortnight
it
was
all
as
white
as
snow
he
remained
a
fortnight
on
board
the
beloved
by
high
and
low
he
walked
the
in
the
dress
of
a
private
gentleman
but
looking
like
an
admiral
the
sailors
touched
their
hats
to
him
with
a
strange
mixture
of
veneration
and
jocoseness
they
called
him
among
themselves
commodore
billy
he
was
supplied
with
funds
by
reginald
and
put
on
board
a
merchant
ship
bound
for
england
he
landed
amid
went
straight
to
barkington
there
he
heard
his
family
were
in
london
he
came
back
to
london
and
sought
them
a
friend
told
him
of
green
he
went
to
him
and
of
course
green
saw
directly
who
he
was
but
able
men
do
cut
business
short
he
gravely
accepted
david
commission
to
find
him
dodd
finding
him
so
confident
david
asked
him
if
he
thought
he
could
find
richard
hardie
or
his
clerk
noah
skinner
both
of
whom
had
levanted
from
barkington
green
who
was
on
a
hot
scent
as
to
skinner
demurely
accepted
both
commissions
and
appointed
david
to
meet
him
at
a
certain
place
at
six
he
came
he
found
green
man
who
took
him
upstairs
and
there
was
that
excited
group
determining
the
ownership
of
his
receipt
now
to
david
that
receipt
was
a
thing
of
yesterday
it
is
mine
said
he
they
all
turned
to
look
at
this
man
with
sober
passionless
voice
and
hair
of
snow
a
keen
cry
from
julia
heart
made
every
heart
there
quiver
and
in
a
moment
she
was
clinging
and
sobbing
on
her
neck
edward
could
only
get
his
hand
and
press
and
kiss
it
instinct
told
them
heaven
had
given
them
their
father
back
mind
and
all
ere
the
joy
and
the
emotion
had
calmed
themselves
alfred
hardie
slipped
out
and
ran
like
a
deer
to
pembroke
street
those
who
were
so
strangely
reunited
could
not
part
for
a
long
time
even
to
go
down
the
stairs
one
by
one
david
was
the
first
to
recover
his
composure
indeed
great
tranquillity
of
spirit
had
ever
since
his
cure
been
a
remarkable
characteristic
of
this
man
nature
his
passing
mania
seemed
to
have
burnt
out
all
his
impetuosity
leaving
him
singularly
sober
calm
and
compton
took
the
money
and
the
will
and
promised
the
executrix
skinner
should
be
decently
interred
and
all
his
debts
paid
out
of
the
estate
he
would
look
in
at
and
now
a
happy
party
wended
their
way
towards
pembroke
street
but
alfred
was
beforehand
with
them
he
went
boldly
up
the
stairs
and
actually
surprised
dodd
and
sampson
together
at
sight
of
him
she
rose
made
him
a
low
curtsey
and
beat
a
retreat
he
whipped
to
the
door
and
set
his
back
against
it
no
said
he
saucily
she
drew
up
majestically
and
the
colour
mounted
in
her
pale
face
what
sir
would
you
detain
me
by
force
and
no
mistake
said
the
audacious
boy
how
else
can
i
detain
you
when
you
hate
me
so
she
began
to
peep
into
his
sparkling
eyes
to
see
the
reason
of
this
strange
conduct
from
the
door
ye
vagabin
said
sampson
no
no
my
friend
said
dodd
trembling
and
still
peering
into
his
sparkling
eyes
mr
alfred
hardie
is
a
gentleman
at
all
events
he
would
not
take
such
a
liberty
with
me
unless
he
had
some
excuse
for
you
are
wonderfully
shrewd
mamma
said
alfred
admiringly
the
excuse
is
i
do
hate
you
as
you
hate
me
and
i
am
very
why
do
you
call
me
mamma
oh
doctor
he
calls
me
th
audacious
no
no
i
can
not
think
he
would
call
me
that
unless
he
had
some
good
news
for
us
both
what
good
news
can
he
have
except
that
his
trile
is
goin
well
and
you
do
care
for
oh
how
can
you
say
so
i
care
for
all
that
concerns
him
he
would
not
come
here
to
insult
my
misery
with
his
happiness
he
is
noble
he
is
generous
with
all
his
faults
how
dare
you
call
me
mamma
sir
call
it
me
again
my
dear
child
because
then
i
shall
you
are
come
to
save
my
heart
from
and
with
this
the
truth
must
be
told
the
stately
dodd
did
fawn
upon
alfred
with
palms
outstretched
and
piteous
eyes
and
certain
cajoling
arts
of
her
sex
give
me
a
kiss
then
mamma
said
the
impudent
boy
and
i
tell
you
a
little
bit
of
good
she
bowed
her
stately
head
directly
and
paid
the
required
tribute
with
servile
humility
and
readiness
well
then
said
alfred
and
was
just
going
to
tell
her
all
but
caught
sight
of
sampson
making
the
most
expressive
pantomime
to
him
to
be
cautious
well
said
he
i
have
seen
a
ah
and
he
is
sure
dodd
is
dodd
lifted
her
hands
to
heaven
but
could
not
speak
in
fact
said
alfred
hesitating
for
he
was
a
wretched
hand
at
a
fib
he
saw
him
not
a
fortnight
ago
on
board
ship
but
that
is
not
all
mamma
the
sailor
says
he
has
his
dodd
sank
on
her
knees
and
said
no
word
to
man
but
many
to
the
giver
of
all
good
when
she
arose
she
said
to
alfred
bring
this
sailor
to
me
i
must
speak
with
him
alfred
coloured
i
do
know
where
to
find
him
just
oh
indeed
said
dodd
quietly
and
this
excited
her
suspicion
and
from
that
moment
the
cunning
creature
lay
in
wait
for
master
alfred
she
plied
him
with
questions
and
he
got
more
and
more
puzzled
how
to
sustain
his
story
at
last
by
way
of
bursting
out
of
his
own
net
he
said
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
his
hair
has
turned
white
but
perhaps
you
wo
mind
and
he
had
a
grey
it
is
not
grey
like
the
doctor
it
is
as
white
as
the
driven
dodd
sighed
then
suddenly
turning
on
alfred
asked
him
did
the
sailor
tell
you
that
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
was
lost
you
have
seen
him
she
screamed
he
is
in
london
he
is
in
the
house
i
feel
him
near
me
and
she
went
into
something
very
like
hysterics
alfred
was
alarmed
and
whispered
the
truth
the
doctor
sent
him
off
to
meet
them
and
recommended
caution
her
nerves
were
in
such
a
state
a
violent
shock
even
of
happiness
might
kill
her
thus
warned
julia
came
into
the
room
alone
and
while
sampson
was
inculcating
for
her
own
sake
she
listened
with
a
superior
smile
and
took
quite
a
different
line
mamma
said
she
he
is
in
the
town
but
i
dare
not
bring
him
here
till
you
are
composed
his
reason
is
restored
but
his
nerves
are
not
so
strong
as
they
were
now
if
you
agitate
yourself
you
will
agitate
him
and
will
do
him
a
serious
this
crafty
speech
produced
an
incredible
effect
on
dodd
it
calmed
her
directly
or
rather
her
great
love
gave
her
strength
to
be
calm
i
will
not
be
such
a
wretch
she
said
see
i
am
composed
quite
composed
bring
me
my
darling
and
you
shall
see
how
good
i
will
be
there
now
julia
see
how
calm
i
am
quite
calm
what
have
i
borne
so
much
misery
with
heaven
help
and
do
you
think
i
can
not
bear
this
great
happiness
for
my
dear
darling
sake
on
this
they
proposed
she
should
retire
to
her
room
and
they
would
go
for
david
think
over
the
meeting
dear
dear
mamma
said
julia
and
then
you
will
behave
well
for
his
sake
who
was
lost
to
us
and
is
husband
and
wife
met
alone
in
dodd
room
no
eye
even
of
the
children
ventured
to
witness
a
scene
so
strange
so
sacred
we
may
try
and
imagine
that
meeting
but
few
of
us
can
conceive
it
by
the
light
of
our
narrow
experience
yet
one
or
two
there
may
be
the
world
is
wide
and
the
adventures
and
emotions
of
our
race
are
many
one
by
one
all
were
had
up
to
that
sacred
room
to
talk
to
the
happy
pair
they
found
david
seated
calmly
at
his
wife
feet
her
soft
hand
laid
on
his
white
hair
lest
he
should
leave
her
again
and
they
told
him
all
the
sorrow
behind
them
and
he
genial
and
kindly
as
ever
told
them
all
the
happiness
before
them
he
spoke
like
the
master
of
the
house
the
father
of
the
family
the
friend
of
them
all
but
with
all
his
goodness
he
was
sternly
resolved
to
have
his
out
of
richard
hardie
he
had
an
interview
with
compton
that
very
night
and
the
lawyer
wrote
a
letter
to
hardie
saying
nothing
about
the
death
of
skinner
but
notifying
that
his
client
captain
dodd
had
recovered
from
noah
skinner
the
receipt
no
for
and
he
was
instructed
to
sue
for
it
unless
repaid
immediately
he
added
captain
dodd
was
mercifully
restored
and
remembered
distinctly
every
particular
of
the
transaction
they
all
thought
in
their
innocence
that
hardie
hardie
was
now
at
an
end
captain
dodd
could
prove
alfred
illusion
to
be
the
simple
truth
but
compton
thought
that
this
evidence
had
come
too
late
what
may
we
not
get
up
and
say
here
is
papa
and
it
is
all
true
cried
julia
indignant
no
miss
dodd
our
case
is
closed
and
take
my
advice
do
subject
your
father
to
the
agitation
of
a
trial
we
can
do
without
well
then
they
would
all
go
as
spectators
and
pray
that
justice
might
prevail
they
did
go
and
all
sat
together
to
hear
a
matter
puzzled
over
which
had
david
come
one
day
earlier
he
would
have
set
at
rest
for
ever
dick
absolom
was
put
in
to
prove
that
alfred
had
put
two
sovereigns
on
the
stumps
for
him
to
bowl
if
he
could
and
after
him
the
defendant
thomas
hardie
a
mild
benevolent
weak
gentleman
was
put
into
the
box
and
swore
the
boy
father
had
come
to
him
with
story
after
story
of
the
plaintiff
madness
and
the
trouble
it
would
get
him
into
and
so
he
had
done
for
the
best
his
simplicity
was
manifest
and
saunders
worked
it
ably
when
colt
got
hold
of
him
and
badgered
him
he
showed
something
more
than
simplicity
he
stuttered
he
contradicted
himself
he
perspired
he
all
but
wept
are
you
sure
you
had
no
spite
against
him
no
you
are
not
sure
eh
this
candid
interpretation
of
his
words
knocked
the
defendant
stupid
he
made
no
reply
but
looked
utterly
flabbergasted
did
he
not
provoke
you
did
he
not
call
you
an
idiot
he
might
satirically
of
course
he
might
laughter
but
did
he
plucking
up
a
little
spirit
no
he
called
me
soft
tommy
this
revelation
and
the
singular
appropriateness
of
the
nickname
were
so
highly
relished
by
an
intelligent
audience
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
trial
could
go
on
for
roars
the
plaintiff
ringing
laugh
was
heard
among
the
rest
the
proceeded
in
this
style
till
the
defendant
began
to
drivel
at
the
mouth
a
little
at
last
after
a
struggle
he
said
with
a
piteous
whine
that
he
could
not
help
it
he
hated
signing
his
name
some
mischief
always
came
of
it
but
this
time
he
had
no
option
no
option
said
colt
what
do
you
mean
and
with
one
or
two
more
turns
of
the
screw
out
came
this
astounding
revelation
richard
said
if
i
did
put
taff
in
one
would
put
in
in
one
what
weeping
in
one
madhouse
my
lord
a
peal
followed
this
announcement
and
colt
sat
down
grinning
saunders
rose
smiling
i
am
much
obliged
to
the
learned
counsel
for
making
my
case
said
he
i
need
not
prolong
the
sufferings
of
the
innocent
you
can
go
down
have
you
any
defence
to
this
action
certainly
my
do
you
call
richard
hardie
no
my
then
had
you
not
better
confine
yourself
to
the
question
of
damages
the
sturdy
saunders
would
not
take
the
hint
he
replied
upon
the
whole
case
and
fought
hard
for
a
verdict
the
line
he
took
was
bold
he
described
richard
hardie
as
a
man
who
had
acquired
a
complete
power
over
his
weaker
brother
and
had
not
only
persuaded
him
by
statements
but
even
compelled
him
by
threats
to
do
what
he
believed
would
be
the
salvation
of
his
nephew
will
you
imitate
the
learned
cruelty
will
you
strike
a
child
in
short
he
made
a
powerful
appeal
to
their
pity
while
pretending
to
address
their
judgments
then
colt
rose
like
a
tower
and
assuming
the
verdict
as
certain
asked
the
jury
for
heavy
damages
he
contrasted
powerfully
the
paltry
claim
to
pity
with
the
anguish
the
plaintiff
had
undergone
he
drew
the
wedding
party
the
insult
to
the
bride
the
despair
of
the
kidnapped
bridegroom
he
lashed
the
whole
gang
of
conspirators
concerned
in
the
crime
regretted
that
they
could
only
make
one
of
all
these
villains
smart
but
hinted
that
richard
and
thomas
hardie
were
in
one
boat
and
that
heavy
damages
inflicted
on
thomas
would
find
the
darker
culprit
out
he
rapped
out
cowper
lines
on
liberty
and
they
were
new
to
the
jury
though
probably
not
to
you
he
warned
the
jury
that
all
our
liberties
depended
on
them
in
vain
said
he
have
we
beheaded
one
tyrant
and
banished
another
to
secure
those
liberties
if
men
are
to
be
allowed
to
send
away
their
own
flesh
and
blood
into
the
worst
of
all
prisons
for
life
and
not
smart
for
it
in
those
lamentably
few
cases
in
which
the
law
finds
them
out
and
lays
hold
of
but
it
would
task
my
abilities
to
the
utmost
and
occupy
more
time
than
is
left
me
to
do
anything
like
justice
to
the
fluent
fiery
eloquence
of
colt
when
he
got
a
great
chance
like
this
fulgurat
et
rapidis
eloquentiae
fluctibus
cuncia
proruit
et
bursts
of
applause
that
neither
crier
nor
judge
could
suppress
bore
witness
to
the
deep
indignation
britons
feel
when
their
liberties
are
tampered
with
by
power
or
fraud
in
defiance
of
law
and
when
he
sat
down
the
jury
were
ready
to
fly
out
at
him
with
in
hand
then
rose
the
passionless
voice
of
justice
according
to
i
wish
i
could
give
the
very
words
the
following
is
the
effect
as
understood
it
lawyers
forgive
my
deficiencies
this
is
an
important
but
not
a
difficult
case
the
plaintiff
sues
the
defendant
under
law
of
for
falsely
imprisoning
him
in
a
madhouse
the
imprisonment
is
admitted
and
the
sufferings
of
the
plaintiff
not
disputed
the
question
is
whether
he
was
insane
at
the
time
of
the
act
now
i
must
tell
you
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind
it
lies
upon
the
defendant
to
prove
the
plaintiff
insanity
rather
than
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
his
own
sanity
has
the
defendant
overcome
this
difficulty
illusion
is
the
best
proof
of
insanity
and
a
serious
endeavour
was
certainly
made
to
fasten
an
illusion
on
the
plaintiff
about
a
sum
of
but
the
proof
was
weak
and
went
partly
on
an
assumption
that
all
error
is
hallucination
this
is
illusory
and
would
if
acted
on
set
one
half
the
kingdom
imprisoning
the
other
half
and
after
all
they
did
not
demonstrate
that
the
plaintiff
was
they
advanced
no
that
richard
hardie
has
not
embezzled
this
i
do
say
it
was
proved
on
the
other
hand
that
he
did
embezzle
that
sum
richard
hardie
sueing
alfred
hardie
for
libel
on
this
evidence
might
possibly
obtain
a
verdict
for
then
the
burden
of
proof
would
lie
on
alfred
hardie
but
here
it
lies
on
those
who
say
he
is
insane
the
fact
appears
to
be
that
the
plaintiff
imbibed
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
his
own
father
integrity
it
was
a
suspicion
founded
on
evidence
imperfect
indeed
but
of
a
sound
character
as
far
as
it
went
there
had
been
a
letter
from
captain
dodd
to
his
family
announcing
his
return
with
upon
him
and
while
as
yet
unaware
of
this
letter
the
plaintiff
heard
david
dodd
accuse
richard
hardie
of
possessing
improperly
the
identical
sum
at
least
he
swears
to
this
and
as
richard
hardie
was
not
called
to
contradict
him
you
are
at
liberty
to
suppose
that
richard
hardie
had
some
difficulty
in
contradicting
him
on
oath
here
then
true
or
false
was
a
rational
suspicion
and
every
man
has
a
right
to
a
rational
suspicion
of
his
neighbour
and
even
to
utter
it
within
due
limits
and
if
he
overstep
those
the
party
slandered
has
his
legal
remedy
but
if
he
omits
his
legal
remedy
and
makes
an
attempt
of
doubtful
legality
not
to
confute
but
to
stifle
the
voice
of
reasonable
suspicion
shrewd
men
will
suspect
all
the
more
but
then
comes
a
distinct
and
respectable
kind
of
evidence
for
the
defendant
he
urges
that
the
plaintiff
was
going
to
sign
away
his
property
to
his
wife
relations
now
this
was
proved
and
a
draft
of
the
deed
put
in
and
sworn
to
this
taken
singly
has
a
very
extraordinary
look
still
you
must
consider
the
reasonable
suspicion
that
money
belonging
to
the
dodds
had
passed
irregularly
to
the
hardies
and
then
the
wonder
is
diminished
young
and
noble
minds
have
in
every
age
done
generous
and
delicate
acts
the
older
we
get
the
less
likely
we
are
to
be
incarcerated
for
a
crime
of
this
character
but
we
are
not
to
imprison
youth
and
chivalry
merely
because
we
have
outgrown
them
to
go
from
particulars
to
generals
the
defendant
on
whom
the
proof
lies
has
advanced
hearsay
and
conjecture
and
not
put
their
originators
into
the
box
the
plaintiff
on
whom
the
proof
does
not
lie
has
advanced
abundant
evidence
that
he
was
sane
at
the
time
of
his
incarceration
this
was
proved
to
demonstration
by
friends
strangers
and
by
here
the
judge
analysed
the
testimony
of
several
of
the
plaintiff
witnesses
as
to
the
parties
themselves
it
is
curious
how
they
impersonated
so
to
speak
their
respective
lines
of
argument
the
representative
of
evidence
and
sound
reasoning
though
accused
of
insanity
was
precise
frank
rational
and
dignified
in
the
and
i
think
you
must
have
noticed
his
good
temper
the
party
who
relied
on
hearsay
and
conjecture
was
as
feeble
as
they
are
he
was
almost
imbecile
as
you
observed
and
looking
at
both
parties
it
really
seems
monstrous
that
the
plaintiff
should
be
the
one
confined
as
a
lunatic
and
the
defendant
allowed
to
run
wild
and
lock
up
his
intellectual
superiors
if
he
means
to
lock
them
up
even
you
and
i
are
hardly
safe
laughter
the
only
serious
question
i
apprehend
is
on
what
basis
the
damages
ought
to
be
assessed
the
plaintiffs
counsel
has
made
a
powerful
appeal
to
your
passions
and
calls
for
vengeance
now
i
must
tell
you
you
have
no
right
to
make
yourselves
ministers
of
vengeance
nor
even
to
punish
the
defendant
in
a
suit
of
the
kind
still
less
ought
you
to
strike
the
defendant
harder
than
you
otherwise
would
in
the
vague
hope
of
punishing
indirectly
the
true
mover
of
the
defendant
and
the
other
puppets
i
must
warn
you
against
that
suggestion
of
the
learned
counsel
if
the
plaintiff
wants
vengeance
the
criminal
law
offers
it
he
comes
here
not
for
vengeance
but
for
compensation
and
restoration
to
that
society
which
he
is
every
way
fitted
to
adorn
more
than
this
and
all
our
sympathies
it
is
not
for
us
to
give
him
but
then
the
defendant
counsel
went
too
far
the
other
way
his
client
he
says
is
next
door
to
an
idiot
and
so
forsooth
his
purse
must
be
spared
entirely
this
is
all
very
well
if
it
could
be
done
without
ignoring
the
plaintiff
and
his
just
claim
to
compensation
why
if
the
defendant
instead
of
being
were
an
idiot
or
a
lunatic
it
would
protect
him
from
punishment
as
a
felon
but
not
from
damages
in
a
suit
a
sane
man
is
not
to
be
falsely
imprisoned
by
a
lunatic
without
full
compensation
from
the
lunatic
or
his
estate
fortiori
he
is
not
to
be
so
imprisoned
by
a
mere
fool
without
just
compensation
supposing
your
verdict
then
to
be
for
the
plaintiff
i
think
vindictive
damages
would
be
unfair
on
this
feeble
defendant
who
has
acted
recklessly
but
under
an
error
and
without
malice
or
bad
faith
on
the
other
hand
nominal
or
even
unsubstantial
damages
would
be
unjust
to
the
plaintiff
and
perhaps
leave
in
some
minds
a
doubt
that
i
think
you
do
not
yourselves
entertain
as
to
the
plaintiff
perfect
sanity
during
the
whole
period
of
his
as
soon
as
his
lordship
had
ended
the
foreman
of
the
jury
said
their
minds
were
quite
made
up
long
ago
in
the
we
find
for
the
plaintiff
with
damages
three
thousand
the
verdict
was
received
with
some
surprise
by
the
judge
and
all
the
lawyers
except
colt
and
by
the
people
with
acclamation
in
the
midst
of
which
colt
announced
that
the
plaintiff
had
just
gained
his
first
class
at
oxford
i
wish
him
joy
said
the
judge
chapter
liv
the
verdict
was
a
to
richard
hardie
he
had
promised
thomas
to
bear
him
blameless
the
old
turks
into
which
he
had
bought
at
were
down
to
and
that
implied
a
loss
of
five
thousand
pounds
on
the
top
of
all
this
came
compton
letter
neatly
copied
by
colls
richard
hardie
was
doubly
and
trebly
ruined
then
in
his
despair
and
hate
he
determined
to
baffle
them
all
ay
and
sting
the
hearts
of
some
of
them
once
more
he
would
give
peggy
his
last
shilling
write
a
line
to
alfred
another
to
julia
assuring
them
he
had
no
money
and
they
had
killed
him
and
with
that
leave
them
both
the
solemn
curse
of
a
dying
father
and
then
kill
himself
not
to
be
interrupted
in
his
plan
he
temporised
with
compton
wrote
that
if
the
receipt
was
really
signed
by
his
agent
of
course
the
loss
must
fall
on
him
it
was
a
large
sum
but
he
would
sell
out
and
do
his
best
in
ten
days
from
date
with
this
he
went
and
bought
a
pistol
and
at
several
chemist
shops
a
little
essential
oil
of
almonds
his
plan
was
to
take
the
poison
and
if
it
killed
without
pain
well
and
good
but
if
it
tortured
him
then
he
would
blow
his
brains
out
at
once
he
soon
arranged
his
worldly
affairs
and
next
day
gave
peggy
his
and
told
her
she
had
better
keep
it
for
fear
he
should
be
arrested
he
sent
her
on
an
errand
to
the
other
part
of
the
town
then
with
his
poison
and
the
pistol
before
him
on
the
table
wrote
a
brief
but
emphatic
curse
for
his
son
and
julia
and
a
line
to
peggy
to
thank
her
for
her
fidelity
to
one
so
much
older
than
herself
and
to
advise
her
to
take
a
tobacconist
shop
with
his
money
when
he
had
done
all
this
he
poured
out
the
fragrant
poison
and
tasted
it
ere
he
could
drink
it
one
of
those
quidnunes
who
are
always
interrupting
a
gentleman
when
he
has
important
business
on
hand
came
running
in
with
all
manner
of
small
intelligence
hardie
put
down
the
glass
and
gave
him
short
sullen
answers
in
hopes
he
would
then
go
away
and
let
him
proceed
to
business
and
at
last
his
visitor
did
rise
and
go
hardie
sat
down
with
a
sigh
of
relief
to
his
fragrant
beverage
does
the
door
open
and
this
bore
poke
in
his
head
oh
i
forgot
to
tell
you
the
old
turks
are
going
up
today
like
a
and
with
this
he
slammed
the
door
again
and
was
off
at
this
the
cup
began
to
tremble
in
the
resolute
wretch
hand
the
old
turks
going
up
he
poured
the
poison
back
into
the
phial
and
put
it
and
the
pistol
and
all
the
letters
carefully
into
his
pocket
and
took
a
cab
to
the
city
the
report
was
true
there
was
an
extraordinary
movement
in
the
old
turks
the
sultan
was
about
to
pay
a
portion
of
this
loan
being
at
six
per
cent
this
had
transpired
and
at
four
the
turks
were
quoted
at
hardie
returned
a
gainer
of
instead
of
a
loser
he
locked
up
the
means
of
death
for
the
present
and
now
an
ordinary
man
would
have
sold
out
and
got
clear
of
the
fatal
trap
but
this
was
not
an
ordinary
man
he
would
not
sell
a
share
that
day
in
the
afternoon
they
rose
to
he
came
home
unloaded
his
pistol
and
made
himself
some
and
with
a
grim
smile
flavoured
it
with
a
few
drops
of
the
poison
that
was
a
delicious
tumbler
the
turks
went
up
up
up
to
then
he
sold
out
and
cleared
and
all
in
about
ten
days
with
this
revived
the
habits
of
his
youth
no
more
cheating
nothing
could
excuse
that
but
the
dread
of
poverty
he
went
to
his
appointment
with
compton
asked
to
see
the
receipt
said
yes
that
was
his
form
and
skinner
handwriting
he
had
never
personally
received
one
farthing
of
the
money
skinner
had
clearly
embezzled
it
but
that
did
not
matter
of
course
captain
dodd
must
not
lose
his
money
send
your
bill
of
costs
in
hardie
hardie
to
me
compton
said
he
they
shall
not
be
taxed
you
have
lost
enough
by
me
there
was
an
air
of
dignity
and
good
faith
about
the
man
that
half
imposed
even
on
compton
and
when
hardie
drew
out
the
notes
and
said
i
should
be
grateful
if
you
would
forgive
me
the
interest
but
for
a
great
piece
of
good
fortune
on
the
stock
exchange
i
could
never
have
paid
the
whole
principal
he
said
warmly
the
interest
should
never
be
demanded
through
he
called
in
colls
delivered
up
the
receipt
and
received
the
from
hardie
o
immortal
cash
you
like
your
great
inventor
have
then
a
kind
of
spirit
as
well
as
a
body
and
on
this
not
on
your
grosser
part
depends
your
personal
identity
so
long
as
that
survives
your
body
may
be
recalled
to
its
lawful
owner
from
heaven
knows
where
compton
rushed
to
pembroke
street
and
put
this
hard
hard
cash
in
david
dodd
hands
once
more
love
and
constancy
had
triumphed
and

and
alfred
were
to
be
married
and
go
down
to
albion
villa
to
prepare
it
for
the
whole
party
tenants
no
more
alfred
had
bought
it
the
commissioners
of
lunacy
had
protected
his
zealously
from
the
first
and
his
trustees
had
now
paid
the
money
over
alfred
consulted
by
dodd
whose
pet
of
pets
he
now
was
as
to
the
guests
to
be
asked
to
the
wedding
breakfast
suggested
none
but
the
tried
friends
of
our
what
an
excellent
idea
said
dodd
naively
sampson
being
duly
invited
asked
if
he
should
bring
his
emulsion
this
proposal
puzzled
all
but
dodd
she
was
found
laughing
heartily
in
a
corner
without
any
sound
of
laughter
being
detected
and
pointed
out
by
julia
she
said
with
a
little
crow
he
means
his
wife
yes
certainly
bring
your
emulcent
pretending
he
had
used
that
more
elegant
word
and
then
they
will
all
see
how
well
you
can
accordingly
he
brought
a
lady
who
was
absurdly
pretty
to
be
the
mother
of
several
grown
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
two
shades
more
quiet
and
placid
than
dodd
she
quietly
had
her
chair
placed
by
sampson
and
whenever
he
got
racy
she
put
a
hand
gently
on
his
shoulder
and
by
some
mesmeric
effect
it
moderated
him
as
neptune
did
the
waves
in
the
aeneid
she
was
such
a
mistress
of
this
mesmeric
art
that
she
carried
on
a
perfect
conversation
with
her
other
neighbour
yet
modulated
her
lion
lord
with
a
touch
of
that
composing
hand
in
a
parenthetical
manner
and
even
while
looking
another
way
this
hand
soft
as
down
yet
irresistible
suppressed
the
great
art
of
healing
vital
chronometry
the
wrongs
of
inventors
the
collusions
of
medicine
the
mad
ox
and
all
but
topics
at
the
very
first
symptom
and
only
just
allowed
the
doctor
to
be
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
julia
and
dodd
had
a
good
cry
at
parting
of
course
alfred
consoled
them
reminded
them
it
was
only
for
a
week
and
carried
off
his
lovely
prize
who
in
the
carriage
soon
dried
her
eyes
upon
his
shoulder
then
she
applied
to
her
new
lord
and
master
for
information
they
that
you
and
me
are
one
now
said
she
interrogatively
he
told
her
triumphantly
it
was
so
at
that
rate
you
are
julius
and
i
am
elfrida
said
she
that
is
a
bargain
said
he
and
sealed
it
on
the
sweet
lips
that
were
murmuring
heaven
so
near
him
in
this
and
now
happy
pair
the
ardour
of
possession
lasted
long
and
was
succeeded
by
the
sober
but
full
felicity
of
conjugal
love
and
high
esteem
combined
they
were
so
young
and
elastic
that
past
sorrows
seemed
but
to
give
one
zest
more
to
the
great
draught
of
happiness
they
now
drank
day
by
day
they
all
lived
together
at
albion
villa
thanks
to
alfred
he
was
by
nature
combative
and
his
warlike
soul
was
roused
at
the
current
theory
that
you
can
not
be
happy
under
the
same
roof
with
your
wife
mother
that
is
cant
said
he
to
dodd
let
us
you
and
i
trample
on
it
hand
in
my
child
said
poor
dodd
sorrowfully
i
am
a
poor
hand
at
trampling
and
everybody
says
a
in
the
house
bores
a
young
gentleman
if
a
young
gentleman
ca
live
happy
with
you
mamma
said
he
kissing
her
he
is
a
little
snob
that
is
all
and
not
fit
to
live
at
all
est
cantilena
that
means
with
cant
they
did
live
together
and
behold
eleven
french
plays
with
their
english
adaptations
confuted
to
the
end
of
time
creatures
so
as
dodd
never
fidget
one
there
is
a
repose
about
them
they
are
balm
to
all
those
they
love
and
blister
to
none
item
no
stranger
could
tell
by
dodd
manner
whether
edward
or
alfred
was
her
own
son
oh
you
happy
little
villa
you
were
as
like
paradise
as
any
mortal
dwelling
can
be
a
day
came
however
when
your
walls
could
no
longer
hold
all
the
happy
inmates
julia
presented
alfred
with
a
lovely
boy
enter
nurses
and
the
villa
showed
symptoms
of
bursting
two
months
more
and
alfred
and
his
wife
and
boy
overflowed
into
the
next
villa
it
was
but
twenty
yards
off
and
there
was
a
double
reason
for
the
migration
as
often
happens
after
a
long
separation
heaven
bestowed
on
captain
and
dodd
another
infant
to
play
about
their
knees
at
present
and
help
them
grow
younger
instead
of
older
for
tender
parents
begin
life
again
with
their
children
the
boys
were
nearly
of
a
size
though
the
nephew
was
a
month
or
two
older
than
his
uncle
a
relationship
that
was
early
impressed
on
their
young
minds
and
caused
those
who
heard
their
prattle
many
a
hearty
laugh
mrs
dodd
said
a
lady
i
could
tell
by
your
manner
which
is
yours
and
which
is
your
why
they
are
both
mine
said
dodd
piteously
and
opening
her
eyes
with
gentle
astonishment
as
years
rolled
on
sampson
made
many
converts
at
home
and
abroad
the
foreign
ones
acknowledged
their
obligations
the
leading
london
physicians
managed
more
skilfully
they
came
into
his
ideas
and
bit
by
bit
reversed
their
whole
practice
and
twenty
years
after
sampson
began
to
strengthen
the
invalid
at
once
instead
of
first
prostrating
him
and
so
causing
either
long
sickness
or
sudden
death
but
with
all
this
they
disowned
their
forerunner
and
still
called
him
a
quack
while
adopting
his
quackery
this
dishonesty
led
them
into
difficulties
to
hide
that
their
whole
practice
in
medicine
was
reversed
on
information
they
went
from
shuffle
to
shuffle
till
at
last
they
reached
this
climax
of
fatuity
and
egotism
the
type
of
disease
is
changed
natura
mutatur
non
nos
mutamur
o
mutable
nature
and
immutable
doctors
o
unstable
omniscience
and
infallible
nescience
the
former
may
err
the
latter
never
in
its
own
opinion
at
this
rate
draining
the
weak
of
their
life
blood
was
the
right
thing
in
cervantes
day
and
when
he
observed
that
it
killed
men
like
sheep
and
said
so
under
the
head
of
sangrado
he
was
confounding
his
own
age
with
an
age
to
come
three
hundred
years
later
in
which
coming
age
depletion
was
to
be
wrong
moliere
in
lashing
the
whole
scholastic
system
of
lancet
purge
and
blister
as
one
of
slaughter
committed
the
same
error
mistook
his
century
for
one
to
come
and
sampson
thirty
years
ago
sang
the
same
tune
and
mistook
his
inflammatory
generation
for
the
cool
generation
as
yet
unborn
in
short
it
is
the
characteristic
of
a
certain
blunder
called
genius
to
see
things
too
far
in
advance
the
surest
way
to
avoid
this
is
not
to
see
them
at
all
but
go
blindly
by
the
cant
of
the
hour
moutonuiere
va
sampson
was
indignant
at
finding
that
these
gentry
after
denouncing
him
for
years
as
a
quack
were
pilfering
his
system
yet
still
reviling
him
he
went
in
a
towering
passion
and
hashed
them
by
tongue
and
pen
told
them
they
were
his
subtractors
now
as
well
as
detractors
asked
them
how
it
happened
that
in
countries
where
there
is
no
sampson
the
type
of
disease
remains
unchanged
depletion
is
the
practice
and
death
the
result
as
it
was
in
every
age
no
man
however
stout
can
help
being
deeply
wounded
when
he
sees
his
ideas
stolen
yet
their
author
and
publisher
disowned
many
men
hearts
have
been
broken
by
this
but
i
doubt
whether
they
were
really
great
men
do
tell
me
lilliput
ever
really
kills
brobdignag
except
of
course
when
brobdignag
takes
medical
advice
of
lilliput
sampson
had
three
shields
against
subtraction
detraction
and
all
the
wrongs
inventors
endure
to
wit
a
choleric
temper
a
keen
sense
of
humour
and
a
good
wife
he
storms
and
rages
at
his
detracting
pupils
but
ends
with
roars
of
laughter
at
their
impudence
i
am
told
he
still
hopes
to
meet
with
justice
some
day
and
to
give
justice
a
chance
he
goes
to
bed
at
ten
for
says
he
jinny
us
jinny
us
take
care
of
your
carcass
and
explains
that
no
genius
ever
lived
to
ninety
without
being
appreciated
if
chatterton
and
keats
had
attended
to
this
they
would
have
been
all
right
if
james
watt
had
died
at
fifty
he
would
have
been
all
wrong
for
at
fifty
he
was
a
failure
so
was
the
painter
etty
the
english
and
then
he
accumulates
examples
his
last
distich
bearing
on
hard
cash
is
worth
recording
miss
julee
said
he
y
are
goen
to
maerry
int
a
strange
family
where
th
ijjit
puts
the
jinnyus
a
madhus
which
like
most
of
the
droll
things
this
man
said
was
true
for
soft
tommy
and
alfred
were
the
two
intellectual
extremes
of
the
whole
tribe
of
hardies
archbold
disappointed
both
in
love
and
revenge
posed
her
understanding
and
soothed
her
mind
with
frank
beverley
and
opium
this
soon
made
the
former
deep
in
love
with
her
and
his
intellect
grew
by
contact
with
hers
but
one
day
news
came
from
australia
that
her
husband
was
dead
now
perhaps
i
shall
surprise
the
reader
if
i
tell
him
that
this
edith
archbold
began
her
wedded
life
a
good
confiding
loving
faithful
woman
yet
so
it
was
the
unutterable
blackguard
she
had
married
he
it
was
who
laboured
to
spoil
her
character
and
succeeded
at
last
and
drove
her
unwilling
at
first
to
other
men
the
news
of
his
death
was
like
a
it
roused
her
she
took
counsel
with
herself
and
hope
revived
in
her
strong
head
and
miserable
heart
she
told
frank
and
watched
him
like
a
hawk
he
instantly
fell
on
his
knees
and
implored
her
to
marry
him
directly
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
turned
away
and
shed
the
most
womanly
tear
that
had
blessed
her
for
years
i
am
not
mad
you
know
said
poor
frank
i
am
only
a
bit
of
a
to
make
a
long
story
short
she
exerted
all
her
intelligence
and
with
her
help
frank
took
measures
towards
superseding
his
commission
of
lunacy
now
in
such
a
case
the
lord
chancellor
always
examines
the
patient
in
person
what
was
the
consequence
instead
of
the
vicarious
old
wolf
who
had
been
devouring
him
at
third
and
fourth
hand
frank
had
two
interviews
with
the
chancellor
himself
a
learned
grave
upright
gentleman
who
questioned
him
kindly
and
shrewdly
and
finding
him
to
be
a
young
man
of
small
intellectual
grasp
but
not
the
least
idiotic
or
mad
superseded
his
commission
in
defiance
of
his
greedy
kinsfolk
and
handed
him
his
property
he
married
edith
archbold
and
she
made
him
as
happy
as
the
day
was
long
for
the
first
year
or
two
she
treated
his
adoration
with
contempt
but
as
years
rolled
on
she
became
more
loving
and
he
more
knowing
they
are
now
a
happy
pair
and
all
between
her
first
honest
love
and
this
her
last
seems
to
her
a
dream
so
you
see
a
female
rake
can
be
ameliorated
by
a
loving
husband
as
well
as
a
male
rake
by
a
loving
wife
it
sounds
absurd
and
will
offend
my
female
readers
and
their
unchristian
prejudices
but
that
jade
is
like
to
be
one
of
the
best
wives
and
mothers
in
england
but
then
mind
you
she
had
always
brains
i
do
not
exactly
know
why
horace
puts
together
those
two
epithets
just
and
tenacious
of
perhaps
he
had
observed
they
go
together
to
be
honest
i
am
not
clear
whether
this
is
so
on
the
grand
scale
but
certainly
the
two
features
did
meet
remarkably
in
one
of
my
characters
alfred
hardie
the
day
the
bank
broke
he
had
said
he
would
pay
the
creditors
he
now
set
to
work
to
do
it
by
degrees
he
got
the
names
and
addresses
lived
on
half
his
income
and
paid
half
away
to
those
creditors
he
even
asked
julia
to
try
and
find
maxley
out
and
do
something
for
him
but
do
let
me
see
him
said
he
trembling
for
i
could
not
answer
for
maxley
was
known
to
be
cranky
but
harmless
and
wandering
about
the
country
julia
wrote
to
green
about
him
alfred
was
an
uphill
game
but
fortune
favours
the
obstinate
as
well
as
the
bold
one
day
about
four
years
after
his
marriage
with
julia
being
in
london
he
found
a
stately
figure
at
the
corner
of
a
street
holding
out
his
hand
for
alms
too
dignified
to
ask
it
except
by
that
mute
and
touching
gesture
it
was
his
father
then
as
truly
noble
natures
must
forgive
the
fallen
alfred
was
touched
to
the
heart
and
thought
of
the
days
of
his
childhood
before
temptation
came
father
said
he
have
you
come
to
this
yes
alfred
said
richard
composedly
i
undertook
too
many
speculations
especially
in
land
and
houses
they
seemed
profitable
at
first
too
but
now
i
am
entirely
hampered
if
you
would
but
relieve
me
of
them
and
give
me
a
guinea
a
week
to
live
on
i
would
forgive
all
your
disobedient
alfred
bit
his
lip
had
a
wrestle
with
the
old
adam
and
said
gently
come
home
with
me
he
took
him
to
barkington
bag
and
baggage
and
his
good
christian
wife
received
the
old
man
with
delight
she
had
prayed
day
and
night
for
this
reconciliation
finding
his
son
so
warm
and
being
himself
as
cool
richard
hardie
entrapped
alfred
into
an
agreement
to
board
and
lodge
him
and
pay
him
a
guinea
every
saturday
at
noon
in
return
for
this
alfred
was
to
manage
richard
property
and
pocket
the
profits
if
any
alfred
assented
the
old
man
chuckled
at
his
son
simplicity
and
made
him
sign
a
formal
agreement
to
that
effect
this
done
he
used
so
sit
brooding
and
miserable
nearly
all
the
week
till
guinea
time
came
and
then
brightened
up
a
bit
one
day
alfred
sent
for
an
accountant
to
look
after
his
father
papers
and
see
if
matters
were
really
desperate
the
accountant
was
not
long
at
work
and
told
alfred
the
accounts
were
perfectly
clear
and
kept
in
the
most
admirable
order
the
cash
balance
is
said
he
and
many
of
the
rents
are
due
it
is
an
agent
you
want
not
an
what
are
you
talking
about
a
balance
of
alfred
was
stupefied
the
accountant
however
soon
convinced
him
by
the
figures
it
was
so
alfred
went
with
the
good
news
to
his
father
his
father
went
into
a
passion
that
is
one
side
of
the
account
ye
fool
said
he
think
of
the
rates
the
taxes
the
outgoings
you
want
to
go
from
your
bargain
and
turn
me
on
the
world
but
i
have
got
you
in
black
and
white
tight
then
alfred
saw
the
truth
and
wondered
at
his
past
obtuseness
his
father
was
a
monomaniac
he
consulted
sampson
and
sampson
told
him
to
increase
the
old
comforts
on
the
sly
and
pay
him
his
guinea
a
week
it
all
you
can
do
for
then
alfred
employed
an
agent
and
received
a
large
income
from
his
father
land
and
houses
and
another
from
his
consols
the
old
gentleman
had
purchased
westward
of
hyde
park
square
and
had
bought
with
excellent
judgment
till
his
mind
gave
way
alfred
never
spent
a
farthing
of
it
on
himself
but
he
took
some
for
his
father
creditors
all
justice
is
good
said
he
even
wild
some
of
these
unhappy
creditors
he
found
in
the
workhouse
the
misses
lunley
that
survived
were
there
alas
he
paid
them
their
four
thousand
pounds
and
restored
them
to
society
the
name
of
hardie
began
to
rise
again
from
the
dust
now
while
richard
hardie
sat
brooding
and
miserable
expecting
utter
ruin
and
only
brightening
up
on
guinea
day
julia
had
a
protege
with
equally
false
views
but
more
cheerful
ones
it
was
an
old
man
with
a
silver
beard
and
a
machine
with
which
he
stamped
leather
into
round
pieces
of
silver
in
his
opinion
nothing
could
have
shaken
that
notion
out
of
his
mind
julia
confirmed
it
she
let
it
be
known
that
she
would
always
cash
five
pieces
of
round
leather
from
matthews
mint
per
day
and
ten
on
friday
when
working
men
are
poorest
she
contrived
this
with
diabolical
no
angelical
cunning
to
save
the
old
man
from
ridicule
and
to
do
his
soul
much
good
all
souls
were
dear
to
her
what
was
the
consequence
he
went
about
with
his
mint
and
relieved
poor
people
and
gratified
his
mania
at
the
same
time
his
face
began
to
beam
with
benevolence
and
innocent
on
richard
hardie
all
was
cordage
and
deep
gloom
sat
on
his
brow
of
these
two
men
which
was
the
rich
man
he
who
had
nothing
yet
thought
he
possessed
enough
for
himself
and
his
neighbours
or
he
who
rolled
in
wealth
but
writhed
under
imaginary
poverty
one
reflection
more
do
not
look
to
see
providence
dash
the
cup
of
prosperity
from
every
dishonest
hand
or
you
will
often
be
disappointed
yet
this
if
you
look
closer
you
shall
often
see
such
a
man
holds
the
glittering
cup
tight
and
nectar
to
the
brim
but
into
that
cup
a
shadowy
hand
squeezes
some
subtle
ingredient
which
turns
that
nectar
to
wormwood
richard
hardie
died
his
end
being
hastened
by
fear
of
poverty
coming
like
an
armed
man
and
his
guinea
a
week
going
matthews
met
with
an
accident
and
being
impervious
to
pain
but
subject
to
death
was
laid
beside
his
poor
mistress
in
anne
churchyard
julia
buried
him
and
had
a
headstone
put
to
his
grave
and
when
this
was
done
she
took
her
husband
to
see
it
on
that
stone
was
fresh
carved
the
true
name
of
the
deceased
james
maxley
i
have
done
what
you
told
me
said
julia
her
sweet
voice
trembling
a
little
even
she
did
not
quite
know
how
her
husband
would
take
it
or
bear
it
i
it
said
alfred
softly
i
saw
who
your
matthews
was
but
i
could
not
speak
of
him
even
to
he
looked
at
the
grave
in
silence
julia
arms
were
round
his
neck
in
a
moment
and
her
wet
cheek
consoling
his
you
have
done
right
my
good
christian
wife
i
wish
i
was
like
you
my
poor
little
jenny
richard
hardie
papers
were
found
in
perfect
order
and
among
them
an
old
will
leaving
to
edward
dodd
on
this
being
announced
to
edward
he
suggested
that
it
was
a
fraud
alfred
had
been
at
him
for
a
long
time
with
offers
of
money
and
failing
there
and
being
a
fine
impetuous
fellow
had
lost
his
temper
and
forged
a
will
in
his
edward
favour
this
scandalous
defence
broke
down
the
document
was
indisputable
and
the
magic
sum
was
forced
down
master
edward
throat
nilly
willy
thus
rose
the
hard
cash
a
second
time
from
the
grave
all
this
enabled
the
tenacious
alfred
to
carry
out
a
design
hardie
late
bank
had
been
made
into
a
shop
but
it
belonged
to
dodd
he
bought
it
of
her
and
set
up
the
bank
again
with
edward
as
managing
partner
this
just
suited
edward
who
sadly
wanted
employment
hardie
rose
again
and
soon
wiped
out
the
late
disgraceful
episode
and
looked
on
to
the
past
centuries
of
honour
and
good
credit
no
creditor
of
richard
hardie
was
left
unpaid
alfred
went
in
for
politics
stood
for
barkington
was
defeated
by
seventeen
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
told
his
friends
he
had
never
succeeded
in
anything
at
first
nor
been
beaten
in
the
end
stood
again
and
became
for
barkington
whence
to
dislodge
him
i
pity
any
one
who
tries
for
a
long
time
dodd
was
nervous
and
used
to
wake
with
a
start
at
night
and
put
out
her
hand
to
make
sure
david
was
not
lost
again
but
this
wore
off
for
years
the
anniversary
of
that
fatal
day
when
he
was
brought
home
on
the
stretcher
came
back
to
them
all
as
a
day
of
gloom
but
that
wore
off
sometimes
the
happiness
of
her
family
seemed
incredible
to
her
remembering
what
they
had
all
gone
through
at
first
their
troubles
were
too
terrible
and
recent
to
be
discussed
but
even
that
wore
off
and
they
could
talk
of
it
all
and
things
bitter
at
the
time
became
pleasant
to
remember
one
midsummer
day
they
had
all
dined
together
rather
early
at
albion
villa
and
sat
on
the
lawn
with
dodd
boy
and
julia
boy
and
girl
playing
about
these
ladies
knees
now
after
a
little
silence
dodd
who
had
been
thinking
quietly
of
many
things
spoke
to
them
all
and
said
if
my
children
and
i
had
not
been
we
never
should
have
survived
that
terrible
time
we
have
passed
through
my
dears
make
friends
of
your
children
my
ah
that
i
will
said
julia
and
caught
up
the
nearest
brat
and
kissed
it
impetuously
for
wifehood
and
maternity
had
not
her
it
was
only
our
being
friends
mamma
said
edward
it
was
our
sticking
together
in
looking
back
on
the
story
now
ended
i
incline
to
conclusion
almost
my
first
word
was
that
she
and
her
children
were
and
my
last
is
to
congratulate
them
that
it
was
so
think
of
their
various
trials
and
temptations
and
imagine
what
would
have
become
of
them
if
family
love
and
unity
had
not
abounded
their
little
house
was
built
on
the
sure
foundation
of
true
family
affection
and
so
the
winds
of
adversity
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
burst
upon
that
house
but
could
not
prevail
against
it
it
was
founded
on
a
rock
