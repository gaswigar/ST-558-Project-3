preface

seems
a
very
little
book
to
introduce
to
so
large
a
continent
no
such
enterprise
would
ever
have
suggested
itself
to
the
mind
of
the
author
who
none

less
when
this
edition
was
proposed
to
him
by
scribner
on
terms
honorable

the
accomplishments
of
our
race
have
of
late
become
so
varied
that
it
is
often
no
easy
task
to
assign
him
whom
we
would
judge
to
his
proper
station
among
men
and
yet
until
this
has
been
done
the
guns
of
our
criticism
can
not
be
accurately
levelled
and
as
a
consequence
the
greater
part
of
our
fire
must
remain
futile
he
for
example
who
would
essay
to
take
account
of
gladstone
must
read
much
else
besides
hansard
he
must
brush
up
his
homer
and
set
himself
to
acquire
some
theology
the
place
of
greece
in
the
providential
order
of
the
world
and
of
laymen
in
the
church
of
england
must
be
considered
together
with
a
host
of
other
subjects
of
much
apparent
irrelevance
to
a
statesman
life
so
too
in
the
case
of
his
distinguished
rival
whose
death
eclipsed
the
gaiety
of
politics
and
banished
epigram
from
parliament
keen
must
be
the
critical
faculty
which
can
nicely
discern
where
the
novelist
ended
and
the
statesman
began
in
benjamin
disraeli
happily
no
such
difficulty
is
now
before
us
thomas
carlyle
was
a
writer
of
books
and
he
was
nothing
else
beneath
this
judgment
he
would
have
winced
but
have
remained
silent
for
the
facts
are
so
little
men
sometimes
though
not
perhaps
so
often
as
is
taken
for
granted
complain
of
their
destiny
and
think
they
have
been
hardly
treated
in
that
they
have
been
allowed
to
remain
so
undeniably
small
but
great
men
with
hardly
an
exception
nauseate
their
greatness
for
not
being
of
the
particular
sort
they
most
fancy
the
poet
gray
was
passionately
fond
so
his
biographers
tell
us
of
military
history
but
he
took
no
quebec
general
wolfe
took
quebec
and
whilst
he
was
taking
it
recorded
the
fact
that
he
would
sooner
have
written
gray
and
so
carlyle
who
panted
for
action
who
hated
eloquence
whose
heroes
were
cromwell
and
wellington
arkwright
and
the
brindley
who
beheld
with
pride
and
no
ignoble
envy
the
bridge
at
auldgarth
his
had
helped
to
build
half
a
century
before
and
then
exclaimed
noble
craft
that
of
a
mason
a
good
building
will
last
longer
than
most
books
than
one
book
in
a
million
who
despised
men
of
letters
and
abhorred
the
public
whose
gospel
was
silence
and
action
spent
his
life
in
talking
and
writing
and
his
legacy
to
the
world
is
volumes
octavo
there
is
a
familiar
melancholy
in
this
but
the
critic
has
no
need
to
grow
sentimental
we
must
have
men
of
thought
as
well
as
men
of
action
poets
as
much
as
generals
authors
no
less
than
artizans
libraries
at
least
as
much
as
militia
and
therefore
we
may
accept
and
proceed
critically
to
examine
carlyle
volumes
remaining
somewhat
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
had
he
had
the
fashioning
of
his
own
destiny
we
should
have
had
at
his
hands
blows
instead
of
books
taking
him
then
as
he
was
a
man
of
letters
perhaps
the
best
type
of
such
since
johnson
died
in
fleet
street
what
are
we
to
say
of
his
volumes
in
them
are
to
be
found
criticism
biography
history
politics
poetry
and
religion
i
mention
this
variety
because
of
a
foolish
notion
at
one
time
often
found
suitably
lodged
in
heads
otherwise
empty
that
carlyle
was
a
passionate
old
man
dominated
by
two
or
three
extravagant
ideas
to
which
he
was
for
ever
giving
utterance
in
language
of
equal
extravagance
the
volumes
octavo
render
this
opinion
untenable
by
those
who
can
read
carlyle
can
not
be
killed
by
an
epigram
nor
can
the
many
influences
that
moulded
him
be
referred
to
any
single
source
the
rich
banquet
his
genius
has
spread
for
us
is
of
many
courses
the
fire
and
fury
of
the
pamphlets
may
be
disregarded
by
the
peaceful
soul
and
the
preference
given
to
the
of
and
present
which
with
its
intense
and
sympathetic
mediaevalism
might
have
been
written
by
a
tractarian
the
of
sterling
is
the
favourite
book
of
many
who
would
sooner
pick
oakum
than
read
the
great
all
through
whilst
the
mere
student
of
may
attach
importance
to
the
essays
on
johnson
burns
and
scott
on
voltaire
and
diderot
on
goethe
and
novalis
and
yet
remain
blankly
indifferent
to
resartus
and
french
revolution
but
true
as
this
is
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
excepting
possibly
the
of
schiller
carlyle
wrote
nothing
not
clearly
recognisable
as
his
all
his
books
are
his
very
own
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
they
are
not
stolen
goods
nor
elegant
exhibitions
of
recently
and
hastily
acquired
wares
this
being
so
it
may
be
as
well
if
before
proceeding
any
further
i
attempt
with
a
scrupulous
regard
to
brevity
to
state
what
i
take
to
be
the
invariable
indications
of
carlyle
literary
handiwork
the
tokens
of
his
presence
carlyle
his
mark
first
of
all
it
may
be
stated
without
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
he
is
one
of
those
who
would
sooner
be
wrong
with
plato
than
right
with
aristotle
in
one
word
he
is
a
mystic
what
he
says
of
novalis
may
with
equal
truth
be
said
of
himself
belongs
to
that
class
of
persons
who
do
not
recognise
the
syllogistic
method
as
the
chief
organ
for
investigating
truth
or
feel
themselves
bound
at
all
times
to
stop
short
where
its
light
fails
them
many
of
his
opinions
he
would
despair
of
proving
in
the
most
patient
court
of
law
and
would
remain
well
content
that
they
should
be
disbelieved
there
in
philosophy
we
shall
not
be
very
far
wrong
if
we
rank
carlyle
as
a
follower
of
bishop
berkeley
for
an
idealist
he
undoubtedly
was
says
he
only
spiritually
and
to
represent
some
idea
and
body
it
forth
heaven
and
earth
are
but
the
of
the
eternal
the
universe
is
but
one
vast
symbol
of
god
nay
if
thou
wilt
have
it
what
is
man
himself
but
a
symbol
of
god
is
not
all
that
he
does
symbolical
a
revelation
to
sense
of
the
mystic
force
that
is
in
him
a
gospel
of
freedom
which
he
the
messias
of
nature
preaches
as
he
can
by
act
and
word
friends
he
elsewhere
observes
our
logical
mensurative
faculty
but
our
imaginative
one
is
king
over
us
i
might
say
priest
and
prophet
to
lead
us
heavenward
or
magician
and
wizard
to
lead
us
hellward
the
understanding
is
indeed
thy
window
too
clear
thou
canst
not
make
it
but
phantasy
is
thy
eye
with
its
retina
healthy
or
diseased
it
would
be
easy
to
multiply
instances
of
this
the
most
obvious
and
interesting
trait
of
carlyle
writing
but
i
must
bring
my
remarks
upon
it
to
a
close
by
reminding
you
of
his
two
favourite
quotations
which
have
both
significance
one
from
shakespeare
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
and
our
little
life
is
rounded
with
a
sleep
the
other
the
exclamation
of
the
in
goethe
thus
at
the
roaring
loom
of
time
i
ply
and
weave
for
god
the
garment
thou
seest
him
by
but
this
is
but
one
side
of
carlyle
there
is
another
as
strongly
marked
which
is
his
second
note
and
that
is
what
he
somewhere
calls
stubborn
realism
the
combination
of
the
two
is
as
charming
as
it
is
rare
no
one
at
all
acquainted
with
his
writings
can
fail
to
remember
his
almost
excessive
love
of
detail
his
lively
taste
for
facts
simply
as
facts
imaginary
joys
and
sorrows
may
extort
from
him
nothing
but
grunts
and
snorts
but
let
him
only
worry
out
for
himself
from
that
great
called
some
undoubted
fact
of
human
and
tender
interest
and
however
small
it
may
be
relating
possibly
to
some
one
hardly
known
and
playing
but
a
small
part
in
the
events
he
is
recording
and
he
will
wax
amazingly
sentimental
and
perhaps
shed
as
many
real
tears
as
sterne
or
dickens
do
sham
ones
over
their
figments
this
realism
of
carlyle
gives
a
great
charm
to
his
histories
and
biographies
the
amount
he
tells
you
is
something
astonishing
no
platitudes
no
rigmarole
no
articles
which
are
the
staple
of
most
biography
but
instead
of
them
all
the
facts
and
features
of
the
case
pedigree
birth
father
and
mother
brothers
and
sisters
education
physiognomy
personal
habits
dress
mode
of
speech
nothing
escapes
him
it
was
a
characteristic
criticism
of
his
on
one
of
miss
martineau
american
books
that
the
story
of
the
way
daniel
webster
used
to
stand
before
the
fire
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
was
worth
all
the
politics
philosophy
political
economy
and
sociology
to
be
found
in
other
portions
of
the
good
lady
writings
carlyle
eye
was
indeed
a
terrible
organ
he
saw
everything
emerson
writing
to
him
says
think
you
see
as
pictures
every
street
church
barracks
baker
shop
forge
wharf
and
ship
and
whatever
stands
creeps
rolls
or
swims
thereabout
and
make
all
your
own
he
crosses
over
one
rough
day
to
dublin
and
he
jots
down
in
his
diary
the
personal
appearance
of
some
unhappy
creatures
he
never
saw
before
or
expected
to
see
again
how
men
laughed
cried
swore
were
all
of
huge
interest
to
carlyle
give
him
a
fact
he
loaded
you
with
thanks
propound
a
theory
you
were
rewarded
with
the
most
vivid
abuse
this
intense
love
for
and
faculty
of
perceiving
what
one
may
call
the
picturesque
accounts
for
his
many
hard
sayings
about
fiction
and
poetry
he
could
not
understand
people
being
at
the
trouble
of
inventing
characters
and
situations
when
history
was
full
of
men
and
women
when
streets
were
crowded
and
continents
were
being
peopled
under
their
very
noses
emerson
utterances
irritated
him
at
times
as
they
well
might
his
orations
and
the
like
long
he
says
see
some
some
event
man
life
american
forest
or
piece
of
creation
which
this
emerson
loves
and
wonders
at
well
depicted
by
emerson
filled
with
the
life
of
emerson
and
cast
forth
from
him
then
to
live
by
itself
but
carlyle
forgot
the
sluggishness
of
the
ordinary
imagination
and
for
the
moment
the
stupendous
dulness
of
the
ordinary
historian
it
can
not
be
matter
for
surprise
that
people
prefer
smollett
clinker
to
his
of
england
footnote
one
need
scarcely
add
nothing
of
the
sort
ever
proceeded
from
emerson
how
should
it
where
was
it
to
come
from
when
to
employ
language
of
own
poor
child
of
nature
overhears
the
author
of
in
criticism
telling
two
worlds
that
are
the
most
valuable
prose
contributions
to
the
literature
of
the
century
his
soul
is
indeed
filled
an
unutterable
sense
of
lamentation
and
mourning
and
woe
arnold
silence
was
once
felt
to
be
provoking
wordsworth
lines
kept
occurring
to
one
mind
matthew
all
his
frolics
is
silent
as
a
standing
pool
but
it
was
better
so
the
third
and
last
mark
to
which
i
call
attention
is
his
humour
nowhere
surely
in
the
whole
field
of
english
literature
shakespeare
excepted
do
you
come
upon
a
more
abundant
vein
of
humour
than
carlyle
though
i
admit
that
the
quality
of
the
ore
is
not
of
the
finest
his
every
production
is
bathed
in
humour
this
must
never
be
though
it
often
has
been
forgotten
he
is
not
to
be
taken
literally
he
is
always
a
humourist
not
unfrequently
a
writer
of
burlesque
and
occasionally
a
buffoon
although
the
spectacle
of
swinburne
taking
carlyle
to
task
as
he
recently
did
for
indelicacy
has
an
oddity
all
its
own
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
can
not
but
concur
with
this
critic
in
thinking
that
carlyle
has
laid
himself
open
particularly
in
his
the
great
to
the
charge
one
usually
associates
with
the
great
and
terrible
name
of
dean
swift
but
it
is
the
dean
with
a
difference
and
the
difference
is
all
in
carlyle
favour
the
former
deliberately
pelts
you
with
dirt
as
did
in
old
days
gentlemen
electors
their
parliamentary
candidates
the
latter
only
occasionally
splashes
you
as
does
a
public
vehicle
pursuing
on
a
wet
day
its
uproarious
course
these
then
i
take
to
be
carlyle
three
principal
marks
or
notes
mysticism
in
thought
realism
in
description
and
humour
in
both
to
proceed
now
to
his
actual
literary
work
first
then
i
would
record
the
fact
that
he
was
a
great
critic
and
this
at
a
time
when
our
literary
criticism
was
a
scandal
he
more
than
any
other
has
purged
our
vision
and
widened
our
horizons
in
this
great
matter
he
taught
us
there
was
no
sort
of
finality
but
only
nonsense
in
that
kind
of
criticism
which
was
content
with
laying
down
some
foreign
masterpiece
with
the
observation
that
it
was
not
suited
for
the
english
taste
he
was
if
not
the
first
almost
the
first
critic
who
pursued
in
his
criticism
the
historical
method
and
sought
to
make
us
understand
what
we
were
required
to
judge
it
has
been
said
that
carlyle
criticisms
are
not
final
and
that
he
has
not
said
the
last
word
about
voltaire
diderot
richter
and
goethe
i
can
well
believe
it
but
reserving
words
for
the
use
of
the
last
man
to
whom
they
would
appear
to
belong
it
is
surely
something
to
have
said
the
sensible
words
uttered
in
english
on
these
important
subjects
we
ought
not
to
forget
the
early
days
of
the
and
quarterly
we
have
critics
now
quieter
more
reposeful
souls
taking
their
ease
on
zion
who
have
entered
upon
a
world
ready
to
welcome
them
whose
keen
rapiers
may
cut
velvet
better
than
did
the
broadsword
of
carlyle
and
whose
later
date
may
enable
them
to
discern
what
their
forerunner
failed
to
perceive
but
when
the
critics
of
this
century
come
to
be
criticized
by
the
critics
of
the
next
an
honourable
if
not
the
highest
place
will
be
awarded
to
carlyle
turn
we
now
to
the
historian
and
biographer
history
and
biography
much
resemble
one
another
in
the
pages
of
carlyle
and
occupy
more
than
half
his
volumes
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
since
they
afford
him
fullest
scope
for
his
three
strong
points
his
love
of
the
wonderful
his
love
of
telling
a
story
as
the
children
say
the
very
beginning
and
his
humour
his
view
of
history
is
sufficiently
lofty
history
says
he
is
the
true
epic
poem
a
universal
divine
scripture
whose
plenary
inspiration
no
one
out
of
bedlam
shall
bring
into
question
nor
is
he
quite
at
one
with
the
ordinary
historian
as
to
the
true
historical
method
time
seems
coming
when
he
who
sees
no
world
but
that
of
courts
and
camps
and
writes
only
how
soldiers
were
drilled
and
shot
and
how
this
ministerial
conjurer
that
other
and
then
guided
or
at
least
held
something
which
he
called
the
rudder
of
government
but
which
was
rather
the
spigot
of
taxation
wherewith
in
place
of
steering
he
could
tax
will
pass
for
a
more
or
less
instructive
gazetteer
but
will
no
longer
be
called
an
historian
nor
does
the
philosophical
method
of
writing
history
please
him
any
better
if
history
is
philosophy
teaching
by
examples
the
writer
fitted
to
compose
history
is
hitherto
an
unknown
man
better
were
it
that
mere
earthly
historians
should
lower
such
pretensions
more
suitable
for
omniscience
than
for
human
science
and
aiming
only
at
some
picture
of
the
things
acted
which
picture
itself
will
be
a
poor
approximation
leave
the
inscrutable
purport
of
them
an
acknowledged
secret
or
at
most
in
reverent
faith
pause
over
the
mysterious
vestiges
of
him
whose
path
is
in
the
great
deep
of
time
whom
history
indeed
reveals
but
only
all
history
and
in
eternity
will
clearly
reveal
this
same
transcendental
way
of
looking
at
things
is
very
noticeable
in
the
following
view
of
biography
as
the
highest
gospel
was
a
biography
so
is
the
life
of
every
good
man
still
an
indubitable
gospel
and
preaches
to
the
eye
and
heart
and
whole
man
so
that
devils
even
must
believe
and
tremble
these
gladdest
tidings
man
is
not
the
thrall
of
circumstances
of
necessity
but
the
victorious
subduer
thereof
these
then
being
his
views
what
are
we
to
say
of
his
works
his
three
principal
historical
works
are
as
everyone
knows
french
revolution
and
the
great
though
there
is
a
very
considerable
amount
of
other
historical
writing
scattered
up
and
down
his
works
but
what
are
we
to
say
of
these
three
is
he
by
virtue
of
them
entitled
to
the
rank
and
influence
of
a
great
historian
what
have
we
a
right
to
demand
of
an
historian
first
surely
stern
veracity
which
implies
not
merely
knowledge
but
honesty
an
historian
stands
in
a
fiduciary
position
towards
his
readers
and
if
he
withholds
from
them
important
facts
likely
to
influence
their
judgment
he
is
guilty
of
fraud
and
when
justice
is
done
in
this
world
will
be
condemned
to
refund
all
moneys
he
has
made
by
his
false
professions
with
compound
interest
this
sort
of
fraud
is
unknown
to
the
law
but
to
nobody
else
me
know
the
facts
may
well
be
the
agonized
cry
of
the
student
who
finds
himself
floating
down
what
arnold
has
called
vast
mississippi
of
falsehood
history
secondly
comes
a
catholic
temper
and
way
of
looking
at
things
the
historian
should
be
a
gentleman
and
possess
a
moral
breadth
of
temperament
there
should
be
no
bitter
protesting
spirit
about
him
he
should
remember
the
world
he
has
taken
upon
himself
to
write
about
is
a
large
place
and
that
nobody
set
him
up
over
us
thirdly
he
must
be
a
born
if
he
is
not
this
he
has
mistaken
his
vocation
he
may
be
a
great
philosopher
a
useful
editor
a
profound
scholar
and
anything
else
his
friends
like
to
call
him
except
a
great
historian
how
does
carlyle
meet
these
requirements
his
veracity
that
is
his
laborious
accuracy
is
admitted
by
the
only
persons
competent
to
form
an
opinion
namely
independent
investigators
who
have
followed
in
his
track
but
what
may
be
called
the
internal
evidence
of
the
case
also
supplies
a
strong
proof
of
it
carlyle
was
as
everyone
knows
a
it
is
part
of
his
mysticism
with
him
man
as
well
as
god
is
a
spirit
either
of
good
or
evil
and
as
such
should
be
either
worshipped
or
reviled
he
is
never
himself
till
he
has
discovered
or
invented
a
hero
and
when
he
has
got
him
he
tosses
and
dandles
him
as
a
mother
her
babe
this
is
a
terrible
temptation
to
put
in
the
way
of
an
historian
and
few
there
be
who
are
found
able
to
resist
it
how
easy
to
keep
back
an
ugly
fact
sure
to
be
a
in
the
way
of
weak
brethren
carlyle
is
above
suspicion
in
this
respect
he
knows
no
reticence
nothing
restrains
him
not
even
the
proprieties
of
history
he
may
after
his
boisterous
fashion
pour
scorn
upon
you
for
looking
grave
as
you
read
in
his
vivid
pages
of
the
reckless
manner
in
which
too
many
of
his
heroes
drove
through
the
ten
commandments
as
likely
as
not
he
will
call
you
a
blockhead
and
tell
you
to
close
your
wide
mouth
and
cease
shrieking
but
dear
me
hard
words
break
no
bones
and
it
is
an
amazing
comfort
to
know
the
facts
is
he
writing
of
cromwell
down
goes
everything
letters
speeches
as
they
were
written
as
they
were
delivered
few
great
men
are
edited
after
this
fashion
were
they
to
be
so
luther
for
example
many
eyes
would
be
opened
very
wide
nor
does
carlyle
fail
in
comment
if
the
protector
makes
a
somewhat
distant
allusion
to
the
barbadoes
carlyle
is
at
your
elbow
to
tell
you
it
means
his
selling
people
to
work
as
slaves
in
the
west
indies
as
for
mirabeau
wild
gabriel
honoré
well
we
are
told
all
about
him
nor
is
frederick
let
off
a
single
absurdity
or
atrocity
but
when
we
have
admitted
the
veracity
what
are
we
to
say
of
the
catholic
temper
the
breadth
of
temperament
the
wide
shakespearian
tolerance
carlyle
ought
to
have
them
all
by
nature
he
was
tolerant
enough
so
true
a
humourist
could
never
be
a
bigot
when
his
is
not
on
a
child
might
lead
him
his
judgments
are
gracious
chivalrous
tinged
with
a
kindly
melancholy
and
divine
pity
but
this
mood
is
never
for
long
some
gadfly
stings
him
he
seizes
his
tomahawk
and
is
off
on
the
trail
it
must
sorrowfully
be
admitted
that
a
long
life
of
opposition
and
indigestion
of
fierce
warfare
with
cooks
and
philistines
spoilt
his
temper
never
of
the
best
and
made
him
too
often
contemptuous
savage
unjust
his
language
then
becomes
unreasonable
unbearable
bad
literature
takes
care
of
herself
you
disobey
her
rules
well
and
good
she
shuts
her
door
in
your
face
you
plead
your
genius
she
replies
temper
and
bolts
it
carlyle
has
deliberately
destroyed
by
his
own
wilfulness
the
value
of
a
great
deal
he
has
written
it
can
never
become
classical
alas
that
this
should
be
true
of
too
many
eminent
englishmen
of
our
time
language
such
as
was
at
one
time
almost
habitual
with
ruskin
is
a
national
humiliation
giving
point
to
the
frenchman
sneer
as
to
our
distinguishing
literary
characteristic
being
in
carlyle
case
much
must
be
allowed
for
his
rhetoric
and
humour
in
slang
phrase
he
always
it
on
does
a
bookseller
misdirect
a
parcel
he
exclaims
malison
on
all
blockheadisms
and
torpid
infidelities
of
which
this
world
is
full
still
all
allowances
made
it
is
a
thousand
pities
and
one
thoughts
turn
away
from
this
stormy
old
man
and
take
refuge
in
the
quiet
haven
of
the
oratory
at
birmingham
with
his
great
protagonist
who
throughout
an
equally
long
life
spent
in
painful
controversy
and
wielding
weapons
as
terrible
as
carlyle
own
has
rarely
forgotten
to
be
urbane
and
whose
every
sentence
is
a
of
beauty
it
must
then
be
owned
that
too
many
of
carlyle
literary
achievements
a
gracious
somewhat
by
force
of
his
genius
he
the
rock
and
spreads
the
water
but
then
like
moses
desecrates
belike
the
deed
in
doing
our
third
requirement
was
it
may
be
remembered
the
gift
of
the
storyteller
here
one
is
on
firm
ground
where
is
the
equal
of
the
man
who
has
told
us
the
story
of
diamond
necklace
it
is
the
vogue
nowadays
to
sneer
at
picturesque
writing
professor
seeley
for
reasons
of
his
own
appears
to
think
that
whilst
politics
and
i
presume
religion
may
be
made
as
interesting
as
you
please
history
should
be
as
dull
as
possible
this
surely
is
a
jaundiced
view
if
there
is
one
thing
it
is
legitimate
to
make
more
interesting
than
another
it
is
the
varied
record
of
man
life
upon
earth
so
long
as
we
have
human
hearts
and
await
human
destinies
so
long
as
we
are
alive
to
the
pathos
the
dignity
the
comedy
of
human
life
so
long
shall
we
continue
to
rank
above
the
philosopher
higher
than
the
politician
the
great
artist
be
he
called
dramatist
or
historian
who
makes
us
conscious
of
the
divine
movement
of
events
and
of
our
fathers
who
were
before
us
of
course
we
assume
accuracy
and
labor
in
our
animated
historian
though
for
that
matter
other
things
being
equal
i
prefer
a
lively
liar
to
a
dull
one
carlyle
is
sometimes
as
irresistible
as
campbells
are
coming
or
lang
syne
he
has
described
some
men
and
some
events
once
and
for
all
and
so
takes
his
place
with
thucydides
tacitus
and
gibbon
pedants
may
try
hard
to
forget
this
and
may
in
their
laboured
nothings
seek
to
ignore
the
author
of
and
french
revolution
but
as
well
might
the
pedestrian
in
cumberland
or
inverness
seek
to
ignore
helvellyn
or
ben
nevis
carlyle
is
and
will
remain
there
when
the
pedant
of
today
has
been
superseded
by
the
pedant
of
remembering
all
this
we
are
apt
to
forget
his
faults
his
eccentricities
and
vagaries
his
buffooneries
his
cynicisms
and
his
egotisms
and
to
ask
ourselves
if
it
be
not
this
man
who
is
it
then
to
be
macaulay
answer
some
and
macaulay
claims
are
not
of
the
sort
to
go
unrecognised
in
a
world
which
loves
clearness
of
expression
and
of
view
only
too
well
macaulay
position
never
admitted
of
doubt
we
know
what
to
expect
and
we
always
get
it
it
is
like
the
old
days
of
grace
cricket
we
went
to
see
the
leviathan
slog
for
six
and
we
saw
it
we
expected
him
to
do
it
and
he
did
it
so
with
macaulay
the
good
whig
as
he
takes
up
the
history
settles
himself
down
in
his
chair
and
knows
it
is
going
to
be
a
bad
time
for
the
tories
macaulay
style
his
style
is
ineffectual
for
the
purpose
of
telling
the
truth
about
anything
it
is
splendid
but
and
in
macaulay
case
the
style
was
the
man
he
had
enormous
knowledge
and
a
noble
spirit
his
knowledge
enriched
his
style
and
his
spirit
consecrated
it
to
the
service
of
liberty
we
do
well
to
be
proud
of
macaulay
but
we
must
add
that
great
as
was
his
knowledge
great
also
was
his
ignorance
which
was
none
the
less
ignorance
because
it
was
wilful
noble
as
was
his
spirit
the
range
of
subject
over
which
it
energized
was
painfully
restricted
he
looked
out
upon
the
world
but
behold
only
the
whigs
were
good
luther
and
loyola
cromwell
and
claverhouse
carlyle
and
newman
they
moved
him
not
their
enthusiasms
were
delusions
and
their
politics
demonstrable
errors
whereas
of
lord
somers
and
charles
first
earl
grey
it
is
impossible
to
speak
without
emotion
but
the
world
does
not
belong
to
the
whigs
and
a
great
historian
must
be
capable
of
sympathizing
both
with
delusions
and
demonstrable
errors
gladstone
has
commented
with
force
upon
what
he
calls
macaulay
invincible
ignorance
and
further
says
that
to
certain
aspects
of
a
case
particularly
those
aspects
most
pleasing
to
gladstone
mind
was
hermetically
sealed
it
is
difficult
to
resist
these
conclusions
and
it
would
appear
no
rash
inference
from
them
that
a
man
in
a
state
of
invincible
ignorance
and
with
a
mind
hermetically
sealed
whatever
else
he
may
be
orator
advocate
statesman
journalist
man
of
letters
can
never
be
a
great
historian
but
indeed
when
one
remembers
macaulay
limited
range
of
ideas
the
commonplaceness
of
his
morality
and
of
his
descriptions
his
absence
of
humour
and
of
pathos
for
though
miss
martineau
says
she
found
one
pathetic
passage
in
the
history
i
have
often
searched
for
it
in
vain
and
then
turns
to
carlyle
to
his
almost
bewildering
affluence
of
thought
fancy
feeling
humour
pathos
his
biting
pen
his
scorching
criticism
his
sympathy
save
in
certain
moods
with
everything
but
the
smug
commonplace
to
prefer
macaulay
to
him
is
like
giving
the
preference
to
birket
foster
over
salvator
rosa
but
if
it
is
not
macaulay
who
is
it
to
be
hepworth
dixon
or
froude
of
bishop
stubbs
and
professor
freeman
it
behoves
every
ignoramus
to
speak
with
respect
sons
of
toil
they
are
worthy
of
their
wage
carlyle
has
somewhere
struck
a
distinction
between
the
historical
artist
and
the
historical
artizan
the
bishop
and
the
professor
are
historical
artizans
artists
they
are
not
and
the
great
historian
is
a
great
artist
england
boasts
two
such
artists
edward
gibbon
and
thomas
carlyle
the
elder
historian
may
be
compared
to
one
of
the
great
alpine
roadways
sublime
in
its
conception
heroic
in
its
execution
superb
in
its
magnificent
uniformity
of
good
workmanship
the
younger
resembles
one
of
his
native
streams
pent
in
at
times
between
huge
rocks
and
tormented
into
foam
and
then
effecting
its
escape
down
some
precipice
and
spreading
into
cool
expanses
below
but
however
varied
may
be
its
fortunes
however
startling
its
changes
always
in
motion
always
in
harmony
with
the
scene
around
is
it
gloomy
it
is
with
the
gloom
of
the
is
it
bright
it
is
with
the
radiance
of
the
sun
it
is
with
some
consternation
that
i
approach
the
subject
of
politics
one
handles
them
as
does
an
inspector
of
police
a
parcel
reported
to
contain
dynamite
the
pamphlets
might
not
unfitly
be
labelled
explosives
in
this
matter
of
politics
there
were
two
carlyles
and
as
generally
happens
in
such
cases
his
last
state
was
worse
than
his
first
up
to
he
not
unfairly
might
be
called
a
liberal
of
uncertain
vote
it
may
be
a
man
difficult
to
work
with
and
impatient
of
discipline
but
still
aglow
with
generous
heat
full
of
sympathy
with
the
poor
and
oppressed
and
of
intense
hatred
of
the
cruel
and
shallow
sophistries
that
then
passed
for
maxims
almost
for
axioms
of
government
in
the
year
when
the
yeomanry
round
glasgow
was
called
out
to
keep
down
some
dreadful
monsters
called
carlyle
describes
how
he
met
an
advocate
of
his
acquaintance
hurrying
along
musket
in
hand
to
his
drill
on
the
links
should
have
the
like
of
this
said
he
cheerily
patting
his
gun
was
the
reply
i
have
yet
quite
settled
on
which
side
and
when
he
did
make
his
choice
on
the
whole
he
chose
rightly
the
author
of
that
noble
pamphlet
published
in
was
at
least
once
a
liberal
let
me
quote
a
passage
that
has
stirred
to
effort
many
a
generous
heart
now
cold
in
death
would
suppose
that
education
were
a
thing
which
had
to
be
advocated
on
the
ground
of
local
expediency
or
indeed
on
any
ground
as
if
it
stood
not
on
the
basis
of
an
everlasting
duty
as
a
prime
necessity
of
man
it
is
a
thing
that
should
need
no
advocating
much
as
it
does
actually
need
to
impart
the
gift
of
thinking
to
those
who
can
not
think
and
yet
who
could
in
that
case
think
this
one
would
imagine
was
the
first
function
a
government
had
to
set
about
discharging
were
it
not
a
cruel
thing
to
see
in
any
province
of
an
empire
the
inhabitants
living
all
mutilated
in
their
limbs
each
strong
man
with
his
right
arm
lamed
how
much
crueller
to
find
the
strong
soul
with
its
eyes
still
sealed
its
eyes
extinct
so
that
it
sees
not
light
has
come
into
the
world
but
to
this
poor
peasant
it
has
come
in
vain
for
six
thousand
years
the
sons
of
adam
in
sleepless
effort
have
been
devising
doing
discovering
in
mysterious
infinite
indissoluble
communion
warring
a
little
band
of
brothers
against
the
black
empire
of
necessity
and
night
they
have
accomplished
such
a
conquest
and
conquests
and
to
this
man
it
is
all
as
if
it
had
not
been
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
are
still
runic
enigmas
to
him
he
passes
by
on
the
other
side
and
that
great
spiritual
kingdom
the
conquest
of
his
own
brothers
all
that
his
brothers
have
conquered
is
a
thing
not
extant
for
him
an
invisible
empire
he
knows
it
not
suspects
it
not
and
is
not
this
his
withal
the
conquest
of
his
own
brothers
the
lawfully
acquired
possession
of
all
men
baleful
enchantment
lies
over
him
from
generation
to
generation
he
knows
not
that
such
an
empire
is
his
that
such
an
empire
is

a

programme
for
and
a
good
part
of
it
has
been
carried
out
but
with
next
to
no
aid
from
carlyle
the
radical
party
has
struggled
on
as
best
it
might
without
the
author
of
and
french
revolution
have
marched
prospering
not
through
his
presence
songs
have
inspired
them
not
from
his
lyre
and
it
is
no
party
spirit
that
leads
one
to
regret
the
change
of
mind
which
prevented
the
later
public
life
of
this
great
man
and
now
the
memory
of
it
from
being
enriched
with
something
better
than
a
note
for
governor
eyre
but
it
could
not
be
helped
what
brought
about
the
rupture
was
his
losing
faith
in
the
ultimate
destiny
of
man
upon
earth
no
more
terrible
loss
can
be
sustained
it
is
of
both
heart
and
hope
he
fell
back
upon
heated
visions
of
heroes
devoting
their
early
days
for
the
most
part
to
hoodwinking
the
people
and
their
latter
ones
more
heroically
to
shooting
them
but
it
is
foolish
to
quarrel
with
results
and
we
may
learn
something
even
from
the
later
carlyle
we
lay
down
john
bright
reform
speeches
and
take
up
carlyle
and
light
upon
a
passage
like
this
delirious
seems
to
me
the
puddle
of
parliament
and
public
upon
what
it
calls
the
reform
measure
that
is
to
say
the
calling
in
of
new
supplies
of
blockheadism
gullibility
bribability
amenability
to
beer
and
balderdash
by
way
of
amending
the
woes
we
have
had
from
previous
supplies
of
that
bad
article
this
view
must
be
accounted
for
as
well
as
mr
bright
we
shall
do
well
to
remember
with
carlyle
that
the
best
of
all
reform
bills
is
that
which
each
citizen
passes
in
his
own
breast
where
it
is
pretty
sure
to
meet
with
strenuous
opposition
the
reform
of
ourselves
is
no
doubt
an
heroic
measure
never
to
be
overlooked
and
in
the
face
of
accusations
of
gullibility
bribability
amenability
to
beer
and
balderdash
our
poor
humanity
can
only
stand
abashed
and
feebly
demur
to
the
bad
english
in
which
the
charges
are
conveyed
but
we
ca
all
lose
hope
we
remember
sir
david
reply
to
lord
rea
once
quoted
by
carlyle
himself
then
said
his
lordship
god
mend
all
by
god
donald
we
must
help
him
to
mend
it
it
is
idle
to
stand
gaping
at
the
heavens
waiting
to
feel
the
thong
of
some
hero
of
questionable
morals
and
robust
conscience
and
therefore
unless
reform
bills
can
be
shown
to
have
checked
purity
of
election
to
have
increased
the
stupidity
of
electors
and
generally
to
have
promoted
corruption
which
notoriously
they
have
not
we
may
allow
carlyle
to
make
his
exit
and
regard
their
presence
in
the
statute
book
if
not
with
rapture
at
least
with
equanimity
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
battle
is
still
raging
the
issue
is
still
uncertain
froude
is
still
free
to
assert
that
the
will
prove
carlyle
was
right
his
political
sagacity
no
reader
of
can
deny
his
insight
into
hidden
causes
and
effects
was
keen
beyond
precedent
nothing
he
ever
said
deserves
contempt
though
it
may
merit
anger
if
we
would
escape
his
conclusion
we
must
not
altogether
disregard
his
premises
bankruptcy
and
death
are
the
final
heirs
of
imposture
and
the
old
faiths
and
forms
are
worn
too
threadbare
by
a
thousand
disputations
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
new
democracy
which
if
it
is
not
merely
to
win
the
battle
but
to
hold
the
country
must
be
ready
with
new
faiths
and
forms
of
her
own
they
are
within
her
reach
if
she
but
knew
it
they
lie
to
her
hand
surely
they
will
not
escape
her
grasp
if
they
do
not
then
in
the
glad
day
when
worship
is
once
more
restored
to
man
he
will
with
becoming
generosity
forget
much
that
carlyle
has
written
and
remembering
more
rank
him
amongst
the
prophets
of
humanity
carlyle
poetry
can
only
be
exhibited
in
long
extracts
which
would
be
here
out
of
place
and
might
excite
controversy
as
to
the
meaning
of
words
and
draw
down
upon
me
the
measureless
malice
of
the
metricists
there
are
however
passages
in
resartus
and
the
revolution
which
have
long
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
sublimest
poetry
of
the
century
and
it
was
therefore
with
great
pleasure
that
i
found
justice
stephen
in
his
book
on
equality
and
fraternity
introducing
a
quotation
from
the
chapter
of
the
book
of
resartus
with
the
remark
that
is
perhaps
the
most
memorable
utterance
of
the
greatest
poet
of
the
age
as
for
carlyle
religion
it
may
be
said
he
had
none
inasmuch
as
he
expounded
no
creed
and
put
his
name
to
no
confession
this
is
the
pedantry
of
the
schools
he
taught
us
religion
as
cold
water
and
fresh
air
teach
us
health
by
rendering
the
conditions
of
disease
well
nigh
impossible
for
more
than
half
a
century
with
superhuman
energy
he
struggled
to
establish
the
basis
of
all
religions
and
godly
fear
not
pleasure
love
god
this
is
the
everlasting
yea
one
remarks
might
here
naturally
come
to
an
end
with
a
word
or
two
of
hearty
praise
of
the
brave
course
of
life
led
by
the
man
who
awhile
back
stood
the
acknowledged
head
of
english
letters
but
the
present
time
is
not
the
happiest
for
a
panegyric
on
carlyle
it
would
be
in
vain
to
deny
that
the
brightness
of
his
reputation
underwent
an
eclipse
visible
everywhere
by
the
publication
of
his
they
surprised
most
of
us
pained
not
a
few
and
hugely
delighted
that
ghastly
crew
the
wreckers
of
humanity
who
are
never
so
happy
as
when
employed
in
pulling
down
great
reputations
to
their
own
miserable
levels
when
these
creatures
as
carlyle
would
have
called
them
have
lit
upon
any
passage
indicative
of
conceit
or
jealousy
or
spite
they
have
fastened
upon
it
and
screamed
over
it
with
a
pleasure
but
and
with
a
horror
but
they
exclaim
hero
robbed
of
the
nimbus
his
inflated
style
cast
around
him
this
preacher
and
reduced
to
his
principal
parts
and
lo
the
main
ingredient
is
most
unmistakably
bile
the
critic
however
has
nought
to
do
either
with
the
sighs
of
the
sorrowful
when
a
hero
falls
or
with
the
scorn
of
the
malicious
rejoicing
as
did
bunyan
juryman
when
faithful
was
condemned
to
die
could
never
endure
him
for
he
would
always
be
condemning
my
way
the
critic
task
is
to
consider
the
book
itself
the
nature
of
its
contents
and
how
it
came
to
be
written
at
all
when
this
has
been
done
there
will
not
be
found
much
demanding
moral
censure
whilst
the
reader
will
note
with
delight
applied
to
the
trifling
concerns
of
life
those
extraordinary
gifts
of
observation
and
apprehension
which
have
so
often
charmed
him
in
the
pages
of
history
and
biography
these
peccant
volumes
contain
but
four
sketches
one
of
his
father
written
in
the
other
three
of
edward
irving
lord
jeffrey
and
carlyle
all
written
after
the
death
of
the
in
the
only
fault
that
has
been
found
with
the
first
sketch
is
that
in
it
carlyle
hazards
the
assertion
that
scotland
does
not
now
contain
his
father
like
it
ought
surely
to
be
possible
to
dispute
this
opinion
without
exhibiting
emotion
to
think
well
of
their
forbears
is
one
of
the
few
weaknesses
of
scotchmen
this
sketch
as
a
whole
must
be
carried
to
carlyle
credit
and
is
a
permanent
addition
to
literature
it
is
pious
after
the
high
roman
fashion
it
satisfies
our
finest
sense
of
the
fit
and
proper
just
exactly
so
should
a
literate
son
write
of
an
illiterate
peasant
father
how
immeasurable
seems
the
distance
between
the
man
from
whom
proceeded
the
volumes
we
have
been
writing
about
and
the
calvinistic
mason
who
did
even
know
his
burns
and
yet
here
we
find
the
whole
distance
spanned
by
filial
love
the
sketch
of
lord
jeffrey
is
inimitable
one
was
getting
tired
of
jeffrey
and
prepared
to
give
him
the
when
carlyle
creates
him
afresh
and
for
the
first
time
we
see
the
bright
little
man
bewitching
us
by
what
he
is
disappointing
us
by
what
he
is
not
the
spiteful
remarks
the
sketch
contains
may
be
considered
along
with
those
of
the
same
nature
to
be
found
only
too
plentifully
in
the
remaining
two
papers
after
careful
consideration
of
the
worst
of
these
remarks
oliphant
explanation
seems
the
true
one
they
are
most
of
them
sparkling
bits
of
carlyle
conversation
she
happily
for
herself
had
a
lively
wit
and
perhaps
not
so
happily
a
biting
tongue
and
was
as
carlyle
tells
us
accustomed
to
make
him
laugh
as
they
drove
home
together
from
london
crushes
by
far
from
genial
observations
on
her
little
recking
how
should
she
that
what
was
so
lightly
uttered
was
being
engraven
on
the
tablets
of
the
most
marvellous
of
memories
and
was
destined
long
afterwards
to
be
written
down
in
grim
earnest
by
a
old
man
and
printed
in
cold
blood
by
an
english
gentleman
the
horrible
description
of
irving
personal
appearance
and
the
other
stories
of
the
same
connection
are
recognised
by
oliphant
as
in
substance
carlyle
whilst
the
malicious
account
of
mrs
basil
montague
is
attributed
by
carlyle
himself
to
his
wife
still
after
dividing
the
total
there
is
a
good
helping
for
each
and
blame
would
justly
be
carlyle
due
if
we
did
not
remember
as
we
are
bound
to
do
that
interesting
as
these
three
sketches
are
their
interest
is
pathological
and
ought
never
to
have
been
given
us
froude
should
have
read
them
in
tears
and
burnt
them
in
fire
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
the
state
of
mind
which
produced
them
they
are
easily
accounted
for
by
our
experience
it
is
a
familiar
feeling
which
prompts
a
man
suddenly
bereft
of
one
whom
he
alone
really
knew
and
loved
to
turn
in
his
fierce
indignation
upon
the
world
and
deride
its
idols
whom
all
are
praising
and
which
yet
to
him
seem
ugly
by
the
side
of
one
of
whom
no
one
speaks
to
be
angry
with
such
a
sentence
as
sands
and
eliots
not
fit
to
compare
with
my
incomparable
jeannie
is
at
once
inhuman
and
ridiculous
this
is
the
language
of
the
heart
not
of
the
head
it
is
no
more
criticism
than
is
the
trumpeting
of
a
wounded
elephant
zoölogy
happy
is
the
man
who
at
such
a
time
holds
both
peace
and
pen
but
unhappiest
of
all
is
he
who
having
dipped
his
sorrow
into
ink
entrusts
the
manuscript
to
a
romantic
historian
the
two
volumes
of
the
and
the
three
volumes
of
unfortunately
did
not
pour
oil
upon
the
troubled
waters
the
partizanship
they
evoked
was
positively
indecent
carlyle
had
her
troubles
and
her
sorrows
as
have
most
women
who
live
under
the
same
roof
with
a
man
of
creative
genius
but
of
one
thing
we
may
be
quite
sure
that
she
would
have
been
the
first
to
use
her
own
expressive
language
to
require
god
to
damn
her
impertinent
sympathizers
as
for
froude
he
may
yet
discover
his
nemesis
in
the
spirit
of
an
angry
woman
whose
privacy
he
has
invaded
and
whose
diary
he
has
most
wantonly
published
these
dark
clouds
are
ephemeral
they
will
roll
away
and
we
shall
once
more
gladly
recognise
the
lineaments
of
an
essentially
lofty
character
of
one
who
though
a
man
of
genius
and
of
letters
neither
outraged
society
nor
stooped
to
it
was
neither
a
rebel
nor
a
slave
who
in
poverty
scorned
wealth
who
never
mistook
popularity
for
fame
but
from
the
first
assumed
and
throughout
maintained
the
proud
attitude
of
one
whose
duty
it
was
to
teach
and
not
to
tickle
mankind
lend
me
your
ears
not
to
crop
but
that
i
may
whisper
into
their
furry
depths
not
quarrel
with
genius
we
have
none
ourselves
and
yet
are
so
constituted
that
we
can
not
live
without
it
on
the
alleged
obscurity
of
browning
poetry
sanity
of
true
genius
was
a
happy
phrase
of
charles
lamb
our
greatest
poets
were
our
sanest
men
chaucer
spenser
shakespeare
milton
and
wordsworth
might
have
defied
even
a
mad
doctor
to
prove
his
worst
to
extol
sanity
ought
to
be
unnecessary
in
an
age
which
boasts
its
realism
but
yet
it
may
be
doubted
whether
if
the
author
of
the
phrase
just
quoted
were
to
be
allowed
once
more
to
visit
the
world
he
loved
so
well
and
left
so
reluctantly
and
could
be
induced
to
forswear
his
elizabethans
and
devote
himself
to
the
literature
of
the
day
he
would
find
many
books
which
his
fine
critical
faculty
would
allow
him
to
pronounce
as
he
once
pronounced
buncle
to
be
in
the
presence
of
a
scotchman
who
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
understand
how
a
book
could
properly
be
said
to
enjoy
either
good
or
bad
health
but
however
this
may
be
this
much
is
certain
that
lucidity
is
one
of
the
chief
characteristics
of
sanity
a
sane
man
ought
not
to
be
unintelligible
lucidity
is
good
everywhere
for
all
time
and
in
all
things
in
a
letter
in
a
speech
in
a
book
in
a
poem
lucidity
is
not
simplicity
a
lucid
poem
is
not
necessarily
an
easy
one
a
great
poet
may
tax
our
brains
but
he
ought
not
to
puzzle
our
wits
we
may
often
have
to
ask
in
humility
what
he
mean
but
not
in
despair
what
he
mean
dreamy
and
inconclusive
the
poet
sometimes
nay
often
can
not
help
being
for
dreaminess
and
inconclusiveness
are
conditions
of
thought
when
dwelling
on
the
very
subjects
that
most
demand
poetical
treatment
misty
therefore
the
poet
has
our
kind
permission
sometimes
to
be
but
muddy
never
a
great
poet
like
a
great
peak
must
sometimes
be
allowed
to
have
his
head
in
the
clouds
and
to
disappoint
us
of
the
wide
prospect
we
had
hoped
to
gain
but
the
clouds
which
envelop
him
must
be
attracted
to
and
not
made
by
him
in
a
sentence
though
the
poet
may
give
expression
to
what
wordsworth
has
called
heavy
and
the
weary
weight
of
all
this
unintelligible
world
we
the
public
who
have
to
read
his
poems
are
entitled
to
demand
that
the
unintelligibility
of
which
we
are
made
to
feel
the
weight
should
be
all
of
it
the
world
and
none
of
it
merely
the
poet
we
should
not
have
ventured
to
introduce
our
subject
with
such
very
general
and
undeniable
observations
had
not
experience
taught
us
that
the
best
way
of
introducing
any
subject
is
by
a
string
of
platitudes
delivered
after
an
oracular
fashion
they
arouse
attention
without
exhausting
it
and
afford
the
pleasant
sensation
of
thinking
without
any
of
the
trouble
of
thought
but
the
subject
once
introduced
it
becomes
necessary
to
proceed
with
it
in
considering
whether
a
poet
is
intelligible
and
lucid
we
ought
not
to
grope
and
grub
about
his
work
in
search
of
obscurities
and
oddities
but
should
in
the
first
instance
at
all
events
attempt
to
regard
his
whole
scope
and
range
to
form
some
estimate
if
we
can
of
his
general
purport
and
effect
asking
ourselves
for
this
purpose
such
questions
as
these
how
are
we
the
better
for
him
has
he
quickened
any
passion
lightened
any
burden
purified
any
taste
does
he
play
any
real
part
in
our
lives
when
we
are
in
love
do
we
whisper
him
in
our
lady
ear
when
we
sorrow
does
he
ease
our
pain
can
he
calm
the
strife
of
mental
conflict
has
he
had
anything
to
say
which
was
twaddle
on
those
subjects
which
elude
analysis
as
they
may
and
defy
demonstration
as
they
do
are
yet
alone
of
perennial
interest
man
on
nature
and
on
human
life
on
the
pathos
of
our
situation
looking
back
on
to
the
irrevocable
and
forward
to
the
unknown
if
a
poet
has
said
or
done
or
been
any
of
these
things
to
an
appreciable
extent
to
charge
him
with
obscurity
is
both
folly
and
ingratitude
but
the
subject
may
be
pursued
further
and
one
may
be
called
upon
to
investigate
this
charge
with
reference
to
particular
books
or
poems
in
browning
case
this
fairly
may
be
done
and
then
another
crop
of
questions
arises
such
as
what
is
the
book
about
with
what
subject
does
it
deal
and
what
method
of
dealing
does
it
employ
is
it
didactical
analytical
or
purely
narrative
is
it
content
to
describe
or
does
it
aspire
to
explain
in
common
fairness
these
questions
must
be
asked
and
answered
before
we
heave
our
critical
at
strange
poets
one
task
is
of
necessity
more
difficult
than
another
students
of
geometry
who
have
pushed
their
researches
into
that
fascinating
science
so
far
as
the
fifth
proposition
of
the
first
book
commonly
called
the
though
now
that
so
many
ladies
read
euclid
it
ought
in
common
justice
to
them
to
be
at
least
sometimes
called
the
will
agree
that
though
it
may
be
more
difficult
to
prove
that
the
angles
at
the
base
of
an
isosceles
triangle
are
equal
and
that
if
the
equal
sides
be
produced
the
angles
on
the
other
side
of
the
base
shall
be
equal
than
it
was
to
describe
an
equilateral
triangle
on
a
given
finite
straight
line
yet
no
one
but
an
ass
would
say
that
the
fifth
proposition
was
one
whit
less
intelligible
than
the
first
when
we
consider
browning
in
his
later
writings
it
will
be
useful
to
bear
this
distinction
in
mind
our
first
duty
then
is
to
consider
browning
in
his
whole
scope
and
range
or
in
a
word
generally
this
is
a
task
of
such
dimensions
and
difficulty
as
in
the
language
of
prospectuses
transcend
individual
enterprise
and
consequently
as
we
all
know
a
company
has
been
recently
floated
or
a
society
established
having
browning
for
its
principal
object
it
has
a
president
two
secretaries
male
and
female
and
a
treasurer
you
pay
a
guinea
and
you
become
a
member
a
suitable
reduction
is
i
believe
made
in
the
unlikely
event
of
all
the
members
of
one
family
flocking
to
be
enrolled
the
existence
of
this
society
is
a
great
relief
for
it
enables
us
to
deal
with
our
unwieldy
theme
in
a
manner
and
to
refer
those
who
have
a
passion
for
solid
information
and
profound
philosophy
to
the
printed
transactions
of
this
learned
society
which
lest
we
should
forget
all
about
it
we
at
once
do
when
you
are
viewing
a
poet
generally
as
is
our
present
plight
the
first
question
is
when
was
he
born
the
second
when
did
he
to
use
a
favourite
phrase
of
the
last
century
now
in
disuse
when
did
he
commence
author
the
third
how
long
did
he
keep
at
it
the
fourth
how
much
has
he
written
and
the
fifth
may
perhaps
be
best
expressed
in
the
words
of
southey
little
peterkin
what
good
came
of
it
all
at
last
quoth
little
peterkin
browning
was
born
in
he
commenced
author
with
the
fragment
called
published
in
he
is
still
writing
and
his
works
as
they
stand
upon
my
shelves
for
editions
vary
number
volumes
little
peterkin
question
is
not
so
easily
answered
but
postponing
it
for
a
moment
the
answers
to
the
other
four
show
that
we
have
to
deal
with
a
poet
more
than
seventy
years
old
who
has
been
writing
for
half
a
century
and
who
has
filled
volumes
the
browning
society
at
all
events
has
assets
the
way
i
propose
to
deal
with
this
literary
mass
is
to
divide
it
in
two
taking
the
year
as
the
line
of
cleavage
in
that
year
the
volume
called
was
published
and
then
nothing
happened
till
the
year
when
our
poet
presented
the
astonished
english
language
with
the
four
volumes
and
the
lines
called
ring
and
the
book
a
poem
which
it
may
be
stated
for
the
benefit
of
that
large
increasing
and
highly
interesting
class
of
persons
who
prefer
statistics
to
poetry
is
longer
than
pope
iliad
by
exactly
lines
we
thus
begin
with
in
and
end
with
personae
in
we
then
begin
again
with
ring
and
the
book
in
but
when
or
where
we
shall
end
can
not
be
stated
published
in
is
better
treated
apart
and
is
therefore
excepted
from
the
first
period
to
which
chronologically
it
belongs
looking
then
at
the
first
period
we
find
in
its
front
eight
plays
written
in
when
its
author
was
years
old
and
put
upon
the
boards
of
covent
garden
theatre
on
the
of
may
macready
playing
strafford
and
miss
helen
faucit
lady
carlisle
it
was
received
with
much
enthusiasm
but
the
company
was
rebellious
and
the
manager
bankrupt
and
after
running
five
nights
the
man
who
played
pym
threw
up
his
part
and
the
theatre
was
closed
passes
victor
and
king
charles
return
of
the
druses
blot
in
the
this
beautiful
and
pathetic
play
was
put
on
the
stage
of
drury
lane
on
the
of
february
with
phelps
as
lord
tresham
miss
helen
faucit
as
mildred
tresham
and
stirling
still
known
to
us
all
as
guendolen
it
was
a
brilliant
success
browning
was
in
the
and
if
it
is
any
satisfaction
for
a
poet
to
hear
a
crowded
house
cry
author
that
satisfaction
has
belonged
to
browning
the
play
ran
several
nights
and
was
only
stopped
because
one
of
macready
bankruptcies
happened
just
then
to
intervene
it
was
afterwards
revived
by
phelps
during
his
management
of
sadlers
wells
birthday
miss
helen
faucit
put
this
upon
the
stage
in
when
it
was
reckoned
a
success
soul
tragedy
to
call
any
of
these
plays
unintelligible
is
ridiculous
and
nobody
who
has
ever
read
them
ever
did
and
why
people
who
have
not
read
them
should
abuse
them
is
hard
to
see
were
society
put
upon
its
oath
we
should
be
surprised
to
find
how
many
people
in
high
places
have
not
read
well
that
ends
well
or
of
athens
but
they
go
about
saying
these
plays
are
unintelligible
like
wise
folk
they
pretend
to
have
read
them
and
say
nothing
in
browning
case
they
are
spared
the
hypocrisy
no
one
need
pretend
to
have
read
tragedy
and
it
seems
therefore
inexcusable
for
anyone
to
assert
that
one
of
the
plainest
most
pointed
and
piquant
bits
of
writing
in
the
language
is
unintelligible
but
surely
something
more
may
be
truthfully
said
of
these
plays
than
that
they
are
comprehensible
first
of
all
they
are
and
not
like
the
dropsical
dramas
of
sir
henry
taylor
and
swinburne
some
of
them
have
stood
the
ordeal
of
actual
representation
and
though
it
would
be
absurd
to
pretend
that
they
met
with
that
overwhelming
measure
of
success
our
critical
age
has
reserved
for
such
dramatists
as
the
late
lord
lytton
the
author
of
the
late
tom
taylor
the
author
of
overland
route
the
late
robertson
the
author
of
byron
the
author
of
boys
wills
the
author
of
burnand
the
author
of
colonel
and
gilbert
the
author
of
so
much
that
is
great
and
glorious
in
our
national
drama
at
all
events
they
proved
themselves
able
to
arrest
and
retain
the
attention
of
very
ordinary
audiences
but
who
can
deny
dignity
and
even
grandeur
to
or
withhold
the
meed
of
a
melodious
tear
from
tresham
what
action
of
what
play
is
more
happily
conceived
or
better
rendered
than
that
of
passes
where
innocence
and
its
reverse
tender
love
and
violent
passion
are
presented
with
emphasis
and
yet
blended
into
a
dramatic
unity
and
a
poetic
perfection
entitling
the
author
to
the
very
first
place
amongst
those
dramatists
of
the
century
who
have
laboured
under
the
enormous
disadvantage
of
being
poets
to
start
with
passing
from
the
plays
we
are
next
attracted
by
a
number
of
splendid
poems
on
whose
base
the
structure
of
browning
fame
perhaps
rests
most
surely
his
dramatic
pieces
poems
which
give
utterance
to
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
persons
other
than
himself
or
as
he
puts
it
when
dedicating
a
number
of
them
to
his
wife
you
saw
me
gather
men
and
women
live
or
dead
or
fashioned
by
my
fancy
enter
each
and
all
and
use
their
service
speak
from
every
mouth
the
speech
a
poem
or
again
in
making
speak
myself
kept
out
of
view
the
very
man
as
he
was
wont
to
do
at
a
rough
calculation
there
must
be
at
least
sixty
of
these
pieces
let
me
run
over
the
names
of
a
very
few
of
them
a
poem
beloved
by
all
true
women
which
the
men
not
unnaturally
perhaps
often
prefer
the
bishops
the
sixteenth
century
one
ordering
his
tomb
of
jasper
and
basalt
in
praxed
church
and
his
nineteenth
century
successor
rolling
out
his
last
duchess
the
in
a
spanish
cloister
del
sarto
lippo
lippi
ben
ezra
death
in
the
desert
italian
in
england
and
englishman
in
italy
it
is
plain
truth
to
say
that
no
other
english
poet
living
or
dead
shakespeare
excepted
has
so
heaped
up
human
interest
for
his
readers
as
has
robert
browning
fancy
stepping
into
a
room
and
finding
it
full
of
principal
characters
what
a
babel
of
tongues
what
a
jostling
of
wits
how
eagerly
one
eye
would
go
in
search
of
hamlet
and
sir
john
falstaff
but
droop
shudderingly
at
the
thought
of
encountering
the
distraught
gaze
of
lady
macbeth
we
should
have
no
difficulty
in
recognising
beatrice
in
the
central
figure
of
that
lively
group
of
laughing
courtiers
whilst
did
we
seek
juliet
it
would
of
course
be
by
appointment
on
the
balcony
to
fancy
yourself
in
such
company
is
pleasant
matter
for
a
midsummer
night
dream
no
poet
has
such
a
gallery
as
shakespeare
but
of
our
modern
poets
browning
comes
nearest
him
against
these
dramatic
pieces
the
charge
of
unintelligibility
fails
as
completely
as
it
does
against
the
plays
they
are
all
perfectly
intelligible
but
and
here
is
the
rub
they
are
not
easy
reading
like
the
estimable
writings
of
the
late
hemans
they
require
the
same
honest
attention
as
it
is
the
fashion
to
give
to
a
lecture
of
professor
huxley
or
a
sermon
of
canon
liddon
and
this
is
just
what
too
many
persons
will
not
give
to
poetry
they
to
hear
a
soft
pulsation
in
their
easy
ear
to
turn
the
page
and
let
their
senses
drink
a
lay
that
shall
not
trouble
them
to
think
it
is
no
great
wonder
it
should
be
so
after
dinner
when
disposed
to
sleep
but
afraid
of
spoiling
our
night
rest
behold
the
witching
hour
reserved
by
the
nineteenth
century
for
the
study
of
poetry
this
treatment
of
the
muse
deserves
to
be
held
up
to
everlasting
scorn
and
infamy
in
a
passage
of
miltonic
strength
and
splendour
we
alas
must
be
content
with
the
observation
that
such
an
opinion
of
the
true
place
of
poetry
in
the
life
of
a
man
excites
in
the
breasts
of
the
rightminded
feelings
akin
to
those
which
charles
lamb
ascribes
to
the
immortal
sarah
battle
when
a
young
gentleman
of
a
literary
turn
on
taking
a
hand
in
her
favourite
game
of
whist
declared
that
he
saw
no
harm
in
unbending
the
mind
now
and
then
after
serious
studies
in
recreations
of
that
kind
she
could
not
bear
so
elia
proceeds
have
her
noble
occupation
to
which
she
wound
up
her
faculties
considered
in
that
light
it
was
her
business
her
duty
the
thing
she
came
into
the
world
to
do
and
she
did
it
she
unbent
her
mind
afterwards
over
a
book
and
so
the
lover
of
poetry
and
browning
after
his
faculties
over
or
over
caesar
or
may
afterwards
if
he
is
so
minded
unbend
himself
over
the
of
species
or
that
still
more
fascinating
record
which
tells
us
how
little
curly
worms
only
give
them
time
enough
will
cover
with
earth
even
the
larger
kind
of
stones
next
to
these
dramatic
pieces
come
what
we
may
be
content
to
call
simply
poems
some
lyrical
some
narrative
the
latter
are
straightforward
enough
and
as
a
rule
full
of
spirit
and
humour
but
this
is
more
than
can
always
be
said
of
the
lyrical
pieces
now
for
the
first
time
in
dealing
with
this
first
period
excluding
we
strike
difficulty
the
chinese
puzzle
comes
in
we
wonder
whether
it
all
turns
on
the
punctuation
and
the
awkward
thing
for
browning
reputation
is
this
that
these
bewildering
poems
are
for
the
most
part
very
short
we
say
awkward
for
it
is
not
more
certain
that
sarah
gamp
liked
her
beer
drawn
mild
than
it
is
that
your
englishman
likes
his
poetry
cut
short
and
so
accordingly
it
often
happens
that
some
estimable
paterfamilias
takes
up
an
odd
volume
of
browning
his
volatile
son
or
moonstruck
daughter
has
left
lying
about
pishes
and
pshaws
and
then
with
an
air
of
much
condescension
and
amazing
candour
remarks
that
he
will
give
the
fellow
another
chance
and
not
condemn
him
unread
so
saying
he
opens
the
book
and
carefully
selects
the
very
shortest
poem
he
can
find
and
in
a
moment
without
sign
or
signal
note
or
warning
the
unhappy
man
is
floundering
up
to
his
neck
in
lines
like
these
which
are
the
third
and
final
stanza
of
a
poem
called
way
of
love
after
for
pastime
if
june
be
refulgent
with
flowers
in
completeness
all
petals
no
prickles
delicious
as
trickles
of
wine
poured
at
and
choose
one
indulgent
to
redness
and
sweetness
or
if
with
experience
of
man
and
of
spider
she
use
my
june
lightning
the
strong
to
stop
the
fresh
spinning
why
june
will
consider
he
comes
up
gasping
and
more
than
ever
persuaded
that
browning
poetry
is
a
mass
of
inconglomerate
nonsense
which
nobody
understands
least
of
all
members
of
the
browning
society
we
need
be
at
no
pains
to
find
a
meaning
for
everything
browning
has
written
but
when
all
is
said
and
done
when
these
few
freaks
of
a
crowded
brain
are
thrown
overboard
to
the
sharks
of
verbal
criticism
who
feed
on
such
things
browning
and
his
great
poetical
achievement
remain
behind
to
be
dealt
with
and
accounted
for
we
do
not
get
rid
of
the
laureate
by
quoting
darling
room
my
heart
delight
dear
room
the
apple
of
my
sight
with
thy
two
couches
soft
and
white
there
is
no
room
so
exquisite
no
little
room
so
warm
and
bright
wherein
to
read
wherein
to
write
or
of
wordsworth
by
quoting
this
my
boy
hung
down
his
head
he
blushed
with
shame
nor
made
reply
and
five
times
to
the
child
i
said
why
edward
tell
me
why
or
of
keats
by
remembering
that
he
once
addressed
a
young
lady
as
follows
come
georgiana
the
rose
is
full
blown
the
riches
of
flora
are
lavishly
strown
the
air
is
all
softness
and
crystal
the
streams
the
west
is
resplendently
clothed
in
beams
the
strength
of
a
rope
may
be
but
the
strength
of
its
weakest
part
but
poets
are
to
be
judged
in
their
happiest
hours
and
in
their
greatest
works
taking
then
this
first
period
of
browning
poetry
as
a
whole
and
asking
ourselves
if
we
are
the
richer
for
it
how
can
there
be
any
doubt
as
to
the
reply
what
points
of
human
interest
has
he
left
untouched
with
what
phase
of
life
character
or
study
does
he
fail
to
sympathize
so
far
from
being
the
block
fools
have
supposed
him
he
is
the
most
dilettante
of
great
poets
do
you
dabble
in
art
and
perambulate
browning
must
be
your
favourite
poet
he
is
art
historian
are
you
devoted
to
music
so
is
he
and
alone
of
our
poets
has
sought
to
fathom
in
verse
the
deep
mysteries
of
sound
do
you
find
it
impossible
to
keep
off
theology
browning
has
more
theology
than
most
bishops
could
puzzle
gamaliel
and
delight
aquinas
are
you
in
love
read
last
ride
together
and
art
portrait
a
gondola
the
fireside
amongst
the
ruins
revenges
worst
of
it
and
a
host
of
others
being
careful
always
to
end
with
madhouse
cell
and
we
are
much
mistaken
if
you
do
not
put
browning
at
the
very
head
and
front
of
the
interpreters
of
passion
the
many
moods
of
sorrow
are
reflected
in
his
verse
whilst
mirth
movement
and
a
rollicking
humour
abound
everywhere
i
will
venture
upon
but
three
quotations
for
it
is
late
in
the
day
to
be
quoting
browning
the
first
shall
be
a
bit
of
blank
verse
about
art
from
lippo
lippi
do
you
mark
we
made
so
that
we
love
first
when
we
see
them
painted
things
we
have
passed
perhaps
a
hundred
times
nor
cared
to
see
and
so
they
are
better
painted
better
to
us
which
is
the
same
thing
art
was
given
for
that
god
uses
us
to
help
each
other
so
lending
our
minds
out
have
you
noticed
now
your
cullion
hanging
face
a
bit
of
chalk
and
trust
me
but
you
should
though
how
much
more
if
i
drew
higher
things
with
the
same
truth
that
were
to
take
the
prior
interpret
god
to
all
of
you
oh
oh
it
makes
me
mad
to
see
what
men
shall
do
and
we
in
our
graves
this
world
no
blot
for
us
nor
blank
it
means
intensely
and
means
good
to
find
its
meaning
is
my
meat
and
drink
the
second
is
some
rhymed
rhetoric
from
cross
day
the
testimony
of
the
dying
jew
in
rome
world
has
been
harsh
and
strange
something
is
wrong
there
needeth
a
change
but
what
or
where
at
the
last
or
first
in
one
point
only
we
sinned
at
worst
lord
will
have
mercy
on
jacob
yet
and
again
in
his
border
see
israel
set
when
judah
beholds
jerusalem
the
stranger
seed
shall
be
joined
to
them
to
jacob
house
shall
the
gentiles
cleave
so
the
prophet
saith
and
his
sons
believe
the
children
of
the
chosen
race
shall
carry
and
bring
them
to
their
place
in
the
land
of
the
lord
shall
lead
the
same
bondsmen
and
handmaids
who
shall
blame
when
the
slaves
enslave
the
oppressed
ones
the
oppressor
triumph
for
evermore
spoke
and
gave
us
the
word
to
keep
bade
never
fold
the
hands
nor
sleep
a
faithless
world
at
watch
and
ward
till
the
christ
at
the
end
relieve
our
guard
by
his
servant
moses
the
watch
was
set
though
near
upon
cockcrow
we
keep
it
yet
if
thou
wast
he
who
at
came
by
the
starlight
naming
a
dubious
name
and
if
we
were
too
heavy
with
sleep
too
rash
with
fear
o
thou
if
that
fell
on
thee
coming
to
take
thine
own
and
we
gave
the
cross
when
we
owed
the
throne
art
the
judge
we
are
bruised
thus
but
the
judgment
over
join
sides
with
us
thine
too
is
the
cause
and
not
more
thine
than
ours
is
the
work
of
these
dogs
and
swine
whose
life
laughs
through
and
spits
at
their
creed
who
maintain
thee
in
word
and
defy
thee
in
deed
withstood
christ
then
be
mindful
how
at
least
we
withstand
barabbas
now
was
our
outrage
sore
but
the
worst
we
spared
to
have
called
these
christians
had
we
dared
let
defiance
to
them
pay
mistrust
of
thee
and
rome
make
amends
for
calvary
the
torture
prolonged
from
age
to
age
by
the
infamy
israel
heritage
by
the
ghetto
plague
by
the
garb
disgrace
by
the
badge
of
shame
by
the
felon
place
by
the
the
bloody
whip
and
the
summons
to
christian
fellowship
boast
our
proof
that
at
least
the
jew
would
wrest
christ
name
from
the
devil
crew
the
last
quotation
shall
be
from
the
veritable
browning
of
one
of
those
poetical
audacities
none
ever
dared
but
the
danton
of
modern
poetry
audacious
in
its
familiar
realism
in
its
total
disregard
of
poetical
environment
in
its
rugged
abruptness
but
supremely
successful
and
alive
with
emotion
is
he
buzzing
in
my
ears
now
that
i
come
to
die
do
i
view
the
world
as
a
vale
of
tears
ah
reverend
sir
not
i
i
viewed
there
once
what
i
view
again
where
the
physic
bottles
stand
on
the
table
edge
is
a
suburb
lane
with
a
wall
to
my
bedside
hand
lane
sloped
much
as
the
bottles
do
from
a
house
you
could
descry
the
is
the
curtain
blue
or
green
to
a
healthy
eye
mine
it
serves
for
the
old
june
weather
blue
above
lane
and
wall
and
that
farthest
bottle
labelled
ether
is
the
house
all
a
terrace
somewhat
near
its
stopper
there
watched
for
me
one
june
a
girl
i
know
sir
it
improper
my
poor
mind
out
of
tune
there
was
a
way
you
crept
close
by
the
side
to
dodge
eyes
in
the
house
two
eyes
except
they
styled
their
house
the
lodge
right
had
a
lounger
up
their
lane
but
by
creeping
very
close
with
the
good
wall
help
their
eyes
might
strain
and
stretch
themselves
to
oes
never
catch
her
and
me
together
as
she
left
the
attic
there
by
the
rim
of
the
bottle
labelled
ether
and
stole
from
stair
to
stair
stood
by
the
gate
alas
we
loved
sir
used
to
meet
how
sad
and
bad
and
mad
it
was
but
then
how
it
was
sweet
the
second
period
of
browning
poetry
demands
a
different
line
of
argument
for
it
is
in
my
judgment
folly
to
deny
that
he
has
of
late
years
written
a
great
deal
which
makes
very
difficult
reading
indeed
no
doubt
you
may
meet
people
who
tell
you
that
they
read
ring
and
the
book
for
the
first
time
without
much
mental
effort
but
you
will
do
well
not
to
believe
them
these
poems
are
difficult
they
can
not
help
being
so
what
is
ring
and
the
book
a
huge
novel
in
lines
told
after
the
method
not
of
scott
but
of
balzac
it
tears
the
hearts
out
of
a
dozen
characters
it
tells
the
same
story
from
ten
different
points
of
view
it
is
loaded
with
detail
of
every
kind
and
description
you
are
let
off
nothing
as
with
a
schoolboy
life
at
a
large
school
if
he
is
to
enjoy
it
at
all
he
must
fling
himself
into
it
and
care
intensely
about
everything
so
the
reader
of
ring
and
the
book
must
be
interested
in
everybody
and
everything
down
to
the
fact
that
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
of
guido
is
eight
years
old
on
the
very
day
he
is
writing
his
speech
and
that
he
is
going
to
have
fried
liver
and
parsley
for
his
supper
if
you
are
prepared
for
this
you
will
have
your
reward
for
the
though
rugged
and
involved
is
throughout
with
the
exception
of
the
speeches
of
counsel
eloquent
and
at
times
superb
and
as
for
the
if
your
interest
in
human
nature
is
keen
curious
almost
professional
if
nothing
man
woman
or
child
has
been
done
or
suffered
or
conceivably
can
be
do
or
suffer
is
without
interest
for
you
if
you
are
fond
of
analysis
and
do
not
shrink
from
dissection
you
will
prize
ring
and
the
book
as
the
surgeon
prizes
the
last
great
contribution
to
comparative
anatomy
or
pathology
but
this
sort
of
work
tells
upon
style
browning
has
i
think
fared
better
than
some
writers
to
me
at
all
events
the
step
from
blot
in
the
to
ring
and
the
book
is
not
so
marked
as
is
the
that
lies
between
barton
and
deronda
but
difficulty
is
not
obscurity
one
task
is
more
difficult
than
another
the
angles
at
the
base
of
the
isosceles
triangles
are
apt
to
get
mixed
and
to
confuse
us
all
man
and
woman
alike
something
or
another
is
a
very
difficult
poem
not
only
to
pronounce
but
to
read
but
if
a
poet
chooses
as
his
subject
napoleon
in
whom
the
cad
the
coward
the
idealist
and
the
sensualist
were
inextricably
mixed
and
purports
to
make
him
unbosom
himself
over
a
bottle
of
gladstone
claret
in
a
tavern
in
leicester
square
you
can
not
expect
that
the
product
should
belong
to
the
same
class
of
poetry
as
coventry
patmore
admirable
in
the
house
it
is
the
method
that
is
difficult
take
the
husband
in
ring
and
the
book
browning
remorselessly
hunts
him
down
tracks
him
to
the
last
recesses
of
his
mind
and
there
bids
him
stand
and
deliver
he
describes
love
not
only
broken
but
breaking
hate
in
its
germ
doubt
at
its
birth
these
are
difficult
things
to
do
either
in
poetry
or
prose
and
people
with
easy
flowing
addisonian
or
tennysonian
styles
can
not
do
them
i
seem
to
overhear
a
still
small
voice
asking
but
are
they
worth
doing
or
at
all
events
is
it
the
province
of
art
to
do
them
the
question
ought
not
to
be
asked
it
is
heretical
being
contrary
to
the
whole
direction
of
the
latter
half
of
this
century
the
chains
binding
us
to
the
rocks
of
realism
are
faster
riveted
every
day
and
the
perseus
who
is
destined
to
cut
them
is
i
expect
some
mischievous
little
boy
at
a
but
as
the
question
has
been
asked
i
will
own
that
sometimes
even
when
deepest
in
works
of
this
the
now
orthodox
school
i
have
been
harassed
by
distressing
doubts
whether
after
all
this
enormous
labour
is
not
in
vain
and
wearied
by
the
effort
overloaded
by
the
detail
bewildered
by
the
argument
and
sickened
by
the
pitiless
dissection
of
character
and
motive
have
been
tempted
to
cry
aloud
quoting
or
rather
in
the
agony
of
the
moment
misquoting
coleridge
thou
better
name
than
all
the
family
of
fame
but
this
ebullition
of
feeling
is
childish
and
even
sinful
we
must
take
our
poets
as
we
do
our
meals
as
they
are
served
up
to
us
indeed
you
may
if
full
of
courage
give
a
cook
notice
but
not
the
who
makes
our
poets
we
may
be
sure
to
appropriate
an
idea
of
the
late
sir
james
stephen
that
if
robert
browning
had
lived
in
the
sixteenth
century
he
would
not
have
written
a
poem
like
ring
and
the
book
and
if
edmund
spenser
had
lived
in
the
nineteenth
century
he
would
not
have
written
a
poem
like
the
queen
it
is
therefore
idle
to
arraign
browning
later
method
and
style
for
possessing
difficulties
and
intricacies
which
are
inherent
to
it
the
method
at
all
events
has
an
interest
of
its
own
a
strength
of
its
own
a
grandeur
of
its
own
if
you
do
not
like
it
you
must
leave
it
alone
you
are
fond
you
say
of
romantic
poetry
well
then
take
down
your
spenser
and
qualify
yourself
to
join
small
transfigured
of
those
who
are
able
to
take
their
they
have
read
their
queen
all
through
the
company
though
small
is
delightful
and
you
will
have
plenty
to
talk
about
without
abusing
browning
who
probably
knows
his
spenser
better
than
you
do
realism
will
not
for
ever
dominate
the
world
of
letters
and
art
the
fashion
of
all
things
passeth
away
but
it
has
already
earned
a
great
place
it
has
written
books
composed
poems
painted
pictures
all
stamped
with
that
which
despite
fluctuations
nay
even
reversals
of
taste
and
opinion
means
immortality
but
against
browning
later
poems
it
is
sometimes
alleged
that
their
meaning
is
obscure
because
their
grammar
is
bad
a
cynic
was
once
heard
to
observe
with
reference
to
that
noble
poem
funeral
that
it
was
a
pity
the
talented
author
had
ever
since
allowed
himself
to
remain
under
the
delusion
that
he
had
not
only
buried
the
grammarian
but
his
grammar
also
it
is
doubtless
true
that
browning
has
some
provoking
ways
and
is
something
too
much
of
a
verbal
acrobat
also
as
his
witty
parodist
the
pet
poet
of
six
generations
of
cambridge
undergraduates
reminds
us
loves
to
dock
the
smaller
parts
of
speech
as
we
curtail
the
already
curtailed
cur
it
is
perhaps
permissible
to
weary
a
little
of
his
and
but
we
believe
we
can
not
be
corrected
when
we
say
that
browning
is
a
poet
whose
grammar
will
bear
scholastic
investigation
better
than
that
of
most
of
apollo
children
a
word
about
one
half
of
and
that
with
browning
usual
the
first
half
is
undoubtedly
obscure
it
is
as
difficult
to
read
as
or
the
of
islam
and
for
the
same
reason
the
author
lack
of
experience
in
the
art
of
composition
we
have
all
heard
of
the
young
architect
who
forgot
to
put
a
staircase
in
his
house
which
contained
fine
rooms
but
no
way
of
getting
into
them
is
a
poem
without
a
staircase
the
author
still
in
his
twenties
essayed
a
high
thing
for
his
subject
singled
out
sordello
compassed
murkily
about
with
ravage
of
six
long
sad
hundred
years
he
partially
failed
and
the
british
public
with
its
accustomed
generosity
and
in
order
i
suppose
to
encourage
the
others
has
never
ceased
girding
at
him
because
years
ago
he
published
at
his
own
charges
a
little
book
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pages
which
even
such
of
them
as
were
then
able
to
read
could
not
understand
poetry
should
be
vital
either
stirring
our
blood
by
its
divine
movement
or
snatching
our
breath
by
its
divine
perfection
to
do
both
is
supreme
glory
to
do
either
is
enduring
fame
there
is
a
great
deal
of
beautiful
poetical
writing
to
be
had
nowadays
from
the
booksellers
it
is
interesting
reading
but
as
one
reads
one
trembles
it
smells
of
mortality
it
would
seem
as
if
at
the
very
birth
of
most
of
our
modern
poems
conscious
parcae
threw
upon
their
roseate
lips
a
stygian
hue
that
their
lives
may
be
prolonged
is
my
pious
prayer
in
these
bad
days
when
it
is
thought
more
educationally
useful
to
know
the
principle
of
the
common
pump
than
keats
on
a
grecian
urn
one
can
not
afford
to
let
any
good
poetry
die
but
when
we
take
down
browning
we
can
not
think
of
him
and
the
bed
together
he
is
so
unmistakably
and
deliciously
alive
die
indeed
when
one
recalls
the
ideal
characters
he
has
invested
with
reality
how
he
has
described
love
and
joy
pain
and
sorrow
art
and
music
as
poems
like
roland
vogler
hope
worst
of
it
ignotus
lost
leader
thoughts
from
abroad
pictures
in
florence
riel
householder
and
scruples
come
tumbling
into
one
memory
one
over
another
we
are
tempted
to
employ
the
language
of
hyperbole
and
to
answer
the
question
browning
die
by
exclaiming
when
niagara
stops
in
him
indeed
we
can
infinite
passion
and
the
pain

common
knowledge
that
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the

is
the

by
us
all
in

after
truth

devoted
to

sport

impressed
into

service

are
there

who
avow
themselves
anxious
to
see
this
their
favourite
pursuit
raised
to
the
dignity
of
a
national
institution
they
would
have
established
and
endowed
carlyle
has
somewhere
described
with
great
humour
the
painful
manner
in
which
kepler
made
his
celebrated
calculations
and
discoveries
but
our
young
men
of
talent
fail
to
see
the
joke
and
take
no
pleasure
in
such
anecdotes
truth
they
feel
is
not
to
be
had
from
them
on
any
such
terms
and
why
should
it
be
is
it
not
notorious
that
all
who
are
lucky
enough
to
supply
wants
grow
rapidly
and
enormously
rich
and
is
not
truth
a
now
recognised
want
in
ten
thousand
homes
wherever
indeed
persons
are
to
be
found
wealthy
enough
to
pay
mudie
a
guinea
and
so
far
literate
as
to
be
able
to
read
what
save
the
modesty
is
there
surprising
in
the
demand
now
made
on
behalf
of
some
young
people
whose
means
are
incommensurate
with
their
talents
that
they
should
be
allowed
as
a
reward
for
doling
out
monthly
or
quarterly
portions
of
truth
to
live
in
houses
have
their
meals
for
nothing
and
a
trifle
of
money
besides
would
bass
consent
to
supply
us
with
beer
in
return
for
board
and
lodging
we
of
course
defraying
the
actual
cost
of
his
brewery
and
allowing
him
some
a
year
for
himself
who
as
he
read
about
or
facts
for
darwin
or
the
history
of
modesty
or
veracity
showing
how
it
came
about
that
these
virtues
are
held
in
their
present
somewhat
general
esteem
would
find
it
in
his
heart
to
grudge
the
admirable
authors
their
freedom
from
petty
cares
but
whether
be
ever
established
or
not
no
one
can
doubt
that
it
is
a
most
fashionable
pastime
and
one
which
is
being
pursued
with
great
vigour
all
hunting
is
so
far
alike
as
to
lead
one
to
believe
that
there
must
sometimes
occur
in
just
as
much
as
in
long
pauses
whilst
the
covers
are
being
drawn
in
search
of
the
game
and
when
thoughts
are
free
to
range
at
will
in
pursuit
of
far
other
objects
than
those
giving
their
name
to
the
sport
if
it
should
chance
to
any
during
some
in
his
hot
chase
whilst
for
example
he
is
waiting
for
the
second
volume
of
an
of
religion
or
for
the
last
thing
out
on
the
fourth
gospel
to
take
up
this
book
and
open
it
at
this
page
we
should
like
to
press
him
for
an
answer
to
the
following
question
you
sure
that
it
is
a
good
thing
for
you
to
spend
so
much
time
in
speculating
about
matters
outside
your
daily
life
and
walk
curiosity
is
no
doubt
an
excellent
quality
in
a
critic
it
is
especially
excellent
to
want
to
know
all
about
a
thing
and
not
merely
one
account
or
version
of
it
to
see
all
round
it
or
at
any
rate
as
far
round
as
is
possible
not
to
be
lazy
or
indifferent
or
easily
put
off
or
scared
away
all
this
is
really
very
excellent
sir
fitz
james
stephen
professes
great
regret
that
we
have
not
got
pilate
account
of
the
events
immediately
preceding
the
crucifixion
he
thinks
it
would
throw
great
light
upon
the
subject
and
no
doubt
if
it
had
occurred
to
the
evangelists
to
adopt
in
their
narratives
the
method
which
long
afterwards
recommended
itself
to
the
author
of
ring
and
the
book
we
should
now
be
in
possession
of
a
mass
of
very
curious
information
but
excellent
as
all
this
is
in
the
realm
of
criticism
the
question
remains
how
does
a
restless
habit
of
mind
tell
upon
conduct
john
mill
was
not
one
from
whose
lips
the
advice
super
antiquas
was
often
heard
to
proceed
and
he
was
by
profession
a
speculator
yet
in
that
significant
book
the
he
describes
this
age
of
as
one
weak
convictions
paralyzed
intellects
and
growing
laxity
of
opinions
is
one
of
those
active
mental
habits
which
as
bishop
butler
tells
us
intensify
their
effects
by
constant
use
and
are
weak
convictions
paralyzed
intellects
and
laxity
of
opinions
amongst
the
effects
of
on
the
majority
of
minds
these
are
not
unimportant
questions
let
us
consider
briefly
the
probable
effects
of
speculative
habits
on
conduct
the
discussion
of
a
question
of
conduct
has
the
great
charm
of
justifying
if
indeed
not
requiring
personal
illustration
and
this
particular
question
is
well
illustrated
by
instituting
a
comparison
between
the
life
and
character
of
charles
lamb
and
those
of
some
of
his
distinguished
friends
personal
illustration
especially
when
it
proceeds
by
way
of
comparison
is
always
dangerous
and
the
dangers
are
doubled
when
the
subjects
illustrated
and
compared
are
favourite
authors
it
behoves
us
to
proceed
warily
in
this
matter
a
dispute
as
to
the
respective
merits
of
gray
and
collins
has
been
known
to
result
in
a
visit
to
an
attorney
and
the
revocation
of
a
will
an
avowed
inability
to
see
anything
in
miss
austen
novels
is
reported
to
have
proved
destructive
of
an
otherwise
good
chance
of
an
indian
judgeship
i
believe
however
i
run
no
great
risk
in
asserting
that
of
all
english
authors
charles
lamb
is
the
one
loved
most
warmly
and
emotionally
by
his
admirers
amongst
whom
i
reckon
only
those
who
are
as
familiar
with
the
four
volumes
of
his
and
letters
as
with
but
how
does
he
illustrate
the
particular
question
now
engaging
our
attention
speaking
of
his
sister
mary
who
as
everyone
knows
throughout
is
called
his
cousin
bridget
he
says
has
been
the
lot
of
my
cousin
oftener
perhaps
than
i
could
have
wished
to
have
had
for
her
associates
and
mine
freethinkers
leaders
and
disciples
of
novel
philosophies
and
systems
but
she
neither
wrangles
with
nor
accepts
their
opinions
nor
did
her
brother
he
lived
his
life
cracking
his
little
jokes
and
reading
his
great
folios
neither
wrangling
with
nor
accepting
the
opinions
of
the
friends
he
loved
to
see
around
him
to
a
contemporary
stranger
it
might
well
have
appeared
as
if
his
life
were
a
frivolous
and
useless
one
as
compared
with
those
of
these
philosophers
and
thinkers
discussed
their
great
schemes
and
affected
to
probe
deep
mysteries
and
were
constantly
asking
is
truth
sipped
his
glass
shuffled
his
cards
and
was
content
with
the
humbler
inquiry
are
trumps
but
to
us
looking
back
upon
that
little
group
and
knowing
what
we
now
do
about
each
member
of
it
no
such
mistake
is
possible
to
us
it
is
plain
beyond
all
question
that
judged
by
whatever
standard
of
excellence
it
is
possible
for
any
reasonable
human
being
to
take
lamb
stands
head
and
shoulders
a
better
man
than
any
of
them
no
need
to
stop
to
compare
him
with
godwin
or
hazlitt
or
lloyd
let
us
boldly
put
him
in
the
scales
with
one
whose
fame
is
in
all
the
churches
with
samuel
taylor
coleridge
metaphysician
bard
there
are
some
men
whom
to
abuse
is
pleasant
coleridge
is
not
one
of
them
how
gladly
we
would
love
the
author
of
if
we
could
but
the
thing
is
flatly
impossible
his
was
an
unlovely
character
the
sentence
passed
upon
him
by
matthew
arnold
parenthetically
in
one
of
the
in
criticism
had
no
morals
is
no
less
just
than
pitiless
as
we
gather
information
about
him
from
numerous
quarters
we
find
it
impossible
to
resist
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
man
neglectful
of
restraint
irresponsive
to
the
claims
of
those
who
had
every
claim
upon
him
willing
to
receive
slow
to
give
in
early
manhood
coleridge
planned
a
pantisocracy
where
all
the
virtues
were
to
thrive
lamb
did
something
far
more
difficult
he
played
cribbage
every
night
with
his
imbecile
father
whose
constant
stream
of
querulous
talk
and
might
well
have
goaded
a
far
stronger
man
into
practising
and
justifying
neglect
that
lamb
with
all
his
admiration
for
coleridge
was
well
aware
of
dangerous
tendencies
in
his
character
is
made
apparent
by
many
letters
notably
by
one
written
in
in
which
he
says
my
friend
cultivate
the
filial
feelings
and
let
no
man
think
himself
released
from
the
kind
charities
of
relationship
these
shall
give
him
peace
at
the
last
these
are
the
best
foundation
for
every
species
of
benevolence
i
rejoice
to
hear
that
you
are
reconciled
with
all
your
relations
this
surely
is
as
valuable
an
to
reflection
as
any
supplied
by
the
highgate
seer
lamb
gave
but
little
thought
to
the
wonderful
difference
between
the
and
the
he
preferred
old
plays
an
odd
diet
some
may
think
on
which
to
feed
the
virtues
but
however
that
may
be
the
noble
fact
remains
that
he
poor
frail
boy
for
he
was
no
more
when
trouble
first
assailed
him
stooped
down
and
without
sigh
or
sign
took
upon
his
own
shoulders
the
whole
burden
of
a
sorrow
coleridge
married
lamb
at
the
bidding
of
duty
remained
single
wedding
himself
to
the
sad
fortunes
of
his
father
and
sister
shall
we
pity
him
no
he
had
his
reward
the
surpassing
reward
that
is
only
within
the
power
of
literature
to
bestow
it
was
lamb
and
not
coleridge
who
wrote
a
reverie
i
told
how
for
seven
long
years
in
hope
sometimes
sometimes
in
despair
yet
persisting
ever
i
courted
the
fair
alice
w
n
and
as
much
as
children
could
understand
i
explained
to
them
what
coyness
and
difficulty
and
denial
meant
in
maidens
when
suddenly
turning
to
alice
the
soul
of
the
first
alice
looked
out
at
her
eyes
with
such
a
reality
of
representment
that
i
became
in
doubt
which
of
them
stood
before
me
or
whose
that
bright
hair
was
and
while
i
stood
gazing
both
the
children
gradually
grew
fainter
to
my
view
receding
and
still
receding
till
nothing
at
last
but
two
mournful
features
were
seen
in
the
uttermost
distance
which
without
speech
strangely
impressed
upon
me
the
effects
of
speech
we
are
not
of
alice
nor
of
thee
nor
are
we
children
at
all
the
children
of
alice
call
bartrum
father
we
are
nothing
less
than
nothing
and
dreams
we
are
only
might
have
godwin
hazlitt
coleridge
where
now
are
their
philosophies
and
systems
bottled
moonshine
which
does
improve
by
keeping
the
actions
of
the
just
smell
sweet
and
blossom
in
the
dust
were
we
disposed
to
admit
that
lamb
would
in
all
probability
have
been
as
good
a
man
as
everyone
agrees
he
was
as
kind
to
his
father
as
full
of
for
the
sake
of
his
sister
as
loving
and
ready
a
friend
even
though
he
had
paid
more
heed
to
current
speculations
it
is
yet
not
without
use
in
a
time
like
this
when
so
much
stress
is
laid
upon
anxious
inquiry
into
the
mysteries
of
soul
and
body
to
point
out
how
this
man
attained
to
a
moral
excellence
denied
to
his
speculative
contemporaries
performed
duties
from
which
they
good
men
as
they
were
would
one
and
all
have
shrunk
how
in
short
he
contrived
to
achieve
what
no
one
of
his
friends
not
even
the
immaculate
wordsworth
or
the
precise
southey
achieved
the
living
of
a
life
the
records
of
which
are
inspiriting
to
read
and
are
indeed
presence
of
a
good
diffused
and
managed
to
do
it
all
without
either
with
or
accepting
the
opinions
that
in
the
air
about
him
but
there
no
relation
between
his
unspeculative
habit
of
mind
and
his
honest
unwavering
service
of
duty
whose
voice
he
ever
obeyed
as
the
ship
the
rudder
it
would
be
difficult
to
name
anyone
more
unlike
lamb
in
many
aspects
of
character
than
johnson
for
whom
he
had
mistakenly
no
warm
regard
but
they
closely
resemble
one
another
in
their
indifference
to
mere
speculation
about
things
if
things
they
can
be
called
outside
our
human
walk
in
their
hearty
love
of
honest
earthly
life
in
their
devotion
to
their
friends
their
kindness
to
dependents
and
in
their
obedience
to
duty
what
caused
each
of
them
the
most
pain
was
the
recollection
of
a
past
unkindness
the
poignancy
of
johnson
grief
on
one
such
recollection
is
historical
and
amongst
lamb
letters
are
to
be
found
several
in
which
with
vast
depths
of
feeling
he
bitterly
upbraids
himself
for
neglect
of
old
friends
nothing
so
much
tends
to
blur
moral
distinctions
and
to
obliterate
plain
duties
as
the
free
indulgence
of
speculative
habits
we
must
all
know
many
a
sorry
scrub
who
has
fairly
talked
himself
into
the
belief
that
nothing
but
his
intellectual
difficulties
prevents
him
from
being
another
francis
we
think
we
could
suggest
a
few
score
of
other
obstacles
would
it
not
be
better
for
most
people
if
instead
of
stuffing
their
heads
with
controversy
they
were
to
devote
their
scanty
leisure
to
reading
books
such
as
to
name
one
only
kaye
of
the
sepoy
war
which
are
crammed
full
of
activities
and
heroisms
and
which
force
upon
the
reader
mind
the
healthy
conviction
that
after
all
whatever
mysteries
may
appertain
to
mind
and
matter
and
notwithstanding
grave
doubts
as
to
the
authenticity
of
the
fourth
gospel
it
is
bravery
truth
and
honour
loyalty
and
hard
work
each
man
at
his
post
which
make
this
planet
inhabitable
in
these
days
of
champagne
and
shoddy
of
display
of
teacups
and
rotten
foundations
especially
too
now
that
the
of
payment
which
was
to
bind
man
to
man
in
the
bonds
of
a
common
pecuniary
interest
is
hopelessly
broken
it
becomes
plain
that
the
real
wants
of
the
age
are
not
analyses
of
religious
belief
nor
discussions
as
to
whether
or
of
tendency
are
the
apter
words
to
describe
god
by
but
a
steady
supply
of
honest
men
who
can
be
safely
trusted
with
small
sums
and
to
do
what
in
them
lies
to
maintain
the
honour
of
the
various
professions
and
to
restore
the
credit
of
english
workmanship
we
want
lambs
not
coleridges
the
verdict
to
be
striven
for
is
not
guessed
but
done
all
our
remarks
are
confined
to
the
realm
of
opinion
faith
may
be
well
left
alone
for
she
is
to
give
her
her
due
our
largest
manufacturer
of
good
works
and
whenever
her
furnaces
are
blown
out
morality
suffers
but
speculation
has
nothing
to
do
with
faith
the
region
of
speculation
is
the
region
of
opinion
and
a
hazy
lazy
delightful
region
it
is
good
to
talk
in
good
to
smoke
in
peopled
with
pleasant
fancies
and
charming
ideas
strange
analogies
and
killing
jests
how
quickly
the
time
passes
there
how
well
it
seems
spent
the
philistines
are
all
outside
everyone
is
reasonable
and
tolerant
and
you
think
and
scheme
and
talk
and
look
at
everything
in
a
hundred
ways
and
from
all
possible
points
of
view
and
it
is
not
till
the
company
breaks
up
and
the
lights
are
blown
out
and
you
are
left
alone
with
silence
that
the
doubt
occurs
to
you
what
is
the
good
of
it
all
where
is
the
actuary
who
can
appraise
the
value
of
a
man
opinions
we
speak
of
a
man
opinions
says
newman
do
we
mean
but
the
collection
of
notions
he
happens
to
have
happens
to
have
how
did
he
come
by
them
it
is
the
knowledge
we
all
possess
of
the
sorts
of
ways
in
which
men
get
their
opinions
that
makes
us
so
little
affected
in
our
own
minds
by
those
of
men
for
whose
characters
and
intellects
we
may
have
great
admiration
a
sturdy
nonconformist
minister
who
thinks
gladstone
the
ablest
and
most
honest
man
as
well
as
the
ripest
scholar
within
the
three
kingdoms
is
no
whit
shaken
in
his
nonconformity
by
knowing
that
his
idol
has
written
in
defence
of
the
apostolical
succession
and
believes
in
special
sacramental
graces
gladstone
may
have
been
a
great
student
of
church
history
whilst
nonconformist
reading
under
that
head
usually
begins
with
luther
theses
but
what
of
that
is
it
not
all
explained
by
the
fact
that
gladstone
was
at
oxford
in
so
at
least
the
nonconformist
minister
will
think
the
admission
frankly
made
that
these
remarks
are
confined
to
the
realms
of
opinion
prevents
me
from
urging
on
everyone
my
prescription
but
with
the
two
exceptions
to
be
immediately
named
i
believe
it
would
be
found
generally
useful
it
may
be
made
up
thus
much
reticence
as
is
consistent
with
upon
and
a
wisely
tempered
indifference
to
the
various
speculative
questions
now
agitated
in
our
midst
this
prescription
would
be
found
to
liberate
the
mind
from
all
kinds
of
cloudy
vapours
which
obscure
the
mental
vision
and
conceal
from
men
their
real
position
and
would
also
set
free
a
great
deal
of
time
which
might
be
profitably
spent
in
quite
other
directions
the
first
of
the
two
exceptions
i
have
alluded
to
is
of
those
who
possess
whether
honestly
come
by
or
not
we
can
not
stop
to
inquire
strong
convictions
upon
these
very
questions
these
convictions
they
must
be
allowed
to
iterate
and
reiterate
and
to
proclaim
that
in
them
is
to
be
found
the
secret
of
all
this
otherwise
unintelligible
world
the
second
exception
is
of
those
who
pursue
truth
as
by
a
divine
compulsion
and
who
can
be
likened
only
to
the
nympholepts
of
old
those
unfortunates
who
whilst
carelessly
strolling
amidst
sylvan
shades
caught
a
hasty
glimpse
of
the
flowing
robes
or
even
of
the
gracious
countenance
of
some
spiritual
inmate
of
the
woods
in
whose
pursuit
their
whole
lives
were
ever
afterwards
fruitlessly
spent
the
nympholepts
of
truth
are
profoundly
interesting
figures
in
the
world
history
but
their
lives
are
melancholy
reading
and
seldom
fail
to
raise
a
crop
of
gloomy
thoughts
their
finely
touched
spirits
are
not
indeed
liable
to
succumb
to
the
ordinary
temptations
of
life
and
they
thus
escape
the
evils
which
usually
follow
in
the
wake
of
speculation
but
what
is
their
labour
reward
readers
of
newman
will
remember
and
will
thank
me
for
recalling
it
to
mind
an
exquisite
passage
too
long
to
be
quoted
in
which
speaking
as
a
catholic
to
his
late
anglican
associates
he
reminds
them
how
he
once
participated
in
their
pleasures
and
shared
their
hopes
and
thus
concludes
too
shall
i
not
feel
the
soothing
recollection
of
those
dear
years
which
i
spent
in
retirement
in
preparation
for
my
deliverance
from
egypt
asking
for
light
and
by
degrees
getting
it
with
less
of
temptation
in
my
heart
and
sin
on
my
conscience
than
ever
before
but
the
passage
is
sad
as
well
as
exquisite
showing
to
us
as
it
does
one
who
from
his
earliest
days
has
rejoiced
in
a
faith
in
god
intense
unwavering
constant
harassed
by
distressing
doubts
he
carries
them
all
in
the
devotion
of
his
faith
the
warmth
of
his
heart
and
the
purity
of
his
life
to
the
throne
where
truth
sits
in
state
living
he
tells
us
in
retirement
and
spending
great
portions
of
every
day
on
his
knees
and
yet
we
ask
the
question
with
all
reverence
what
did
newman
get
in
exchange
for
his
prayers
think
it
impossible
to
withstand
the
evidence
which
is
brought
for
the
liquefaction
of
the
blood
of
januarius
at
naples
or
for
the
motion
of
the
eyes
of
the
pictures
of
the
madonna
in
the
roman
states
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
the
material
of
the
lombard
cross
at
monza
and
i
do
not
see
why
the
holy
coat
at
trèves
may
not
have
been
what
it
professes
to
be
i
firmly
believe
that
portions
of
the
true
cross
are
at
rome
and
elsewhere
that
the
crib
of
bethlehem
is
at
rome
and
the
bodies
of
peter
and
paul
also
i
firmly
believe
that
the
relics
of
the
saints
are
doing
innumerable
miracles
and
graces
daily
i
firmly
believe
that
before
now
saints
have
raised
the
dead
to
life
crossed
the
seas
without
vessels
multiplied
grain
and
bread
cured
incurable
diseases
and
stopped
the
operations
of
the
laws
of
the
universe
in
a
multitude
of
ways
so
writes
newman
with
that
candour
that
love
of
putting
the
case
most
strongly
against
himself
which
is
only
one
of
the
lovely
characteristics
of
the
man
whose
long
life
has
been
a
miracle
of
beauty
and
grace
and
who
has
contrived
to
instil
into
his
very
controversies
more
of
the
spirit
of
christ
than
most
men
can
find
room
for
in
their
prayers
but
the
dilemma
is
an
awkward
one
does
the
madonna
wink
or
is
heaven
deaf
oh
spirit
of
truth
where
wert
thou
when
the
remorseless
deep
of
superstition
closed
over
the
head
of
john
henry
newman
who
surely
deserved
to
be
thy
son
but
this
is
a
digression
with
the
nympholepts
of
truth
we
have
nought
to
do
they
must
be
allowed
to
pursue
their
lonely
and
devious
paths
and
though
the
records
of
their
wanderings
their
conflicting
conclusions
and
their
may
fill
us
with
despair
still
they
are
witnesses
whose
testimony
we
could
ill
afford
to
lose
but
there
are
not
many
nympholepts
the
symptoms
of
the
great
majority
of
our
modern
are
very
different
as
they
will
with
their
frank
candour
be
the
first
to
admit
they
are
free
drop
their
swords
and
daggers
whenever
so
commanded
and
it
is
high
time
they
did
with
these
two
exceptions
i
think
my
prescription
will
be
found
of
general
utility
and
likely
to
promote
a
healthy
flow
of
good
works
i
had
intended
to
say
something
as
to
the
effect
of
speculative
habits
upon
the
intellect
but
can
not
now
do
so
the
following
shrewd
remark
of
latham
in
his
interesting
book
on
the
of
may
however
be
quoted
its
bearing
will
be
at
once
seen
and
its
truth
recognised
by
many
man
who
has
been
thus
provided
with
views
and
acute
observations
may
have
destroyed
in
himself
the
germs
of
that
power
which
he
simulates
he
might
have
had
a
thought
or
two
now
and
then
if
he
had
been
let
alone
but
if
he
is
made
first
to
aim
at
a
standard
of
thought
above
his
years
and
then
finds
he
can
get
the
sort
of
thoughts
he
wants
without
thinking
he
is
in
a
fair
way
to
be
spoiled
actors
most
people
i
suppose
at
one
time
or
another
in
their
lives
have
felt
the
charm
of
an
actor
life
as
they
were
free
to
fancy
it
irresistible
what
is
it
to
be
a
great
actor
i
say
a
great
actor
because
i
am
sure
no
amateur
ever
fancied
himself
a
small
one
is
it
not
always
to
have
the
best
parts
in
the
best
plays
to
be
the
central
figure
of
every
group
to
feel
that
attention
is
arrested
the
moment
you
come
on
the
stage
and
more
exquisite
satisfaction
still
to
be
aware
that
it
is
relaxed
when
you
go
off
to
have
silence
secured
for
your
smallest
utterances
to
know
that
the
highest
dramatic
talent
has
been
exercised
to
invent
situations
for
the
very
purpose
of
giving
effect
to
words
and
dignity
to
actions
to
quell
all
opposition
by
the
majesty
of
your
bearing
or
the
brilliancy
of
your
wit
and
finally
either
to
triumph
over
disaster
or
if
you
be
cast
in
tragedy
happier
still
to
die
upon
the
stage
supremely
pitied
and
honestly
mourned
for
at
least
a
minute
and
then
from
first
to
last
applause
loud
and
long
not
postponed
not
even
delayed
but
following
immediately
after
for
a
piece
of
diseased
egotism
that
is
for
a
man
what
a
lot
is
this
how
pointed
how
poignant
the
contrast
between
a
hero
on
the
boards
and
a
hero
in
the
streets
in
the
world
theatre
the
man
who
is
really
playing
the
leading
part
did
we
but
know
it
is
too
often
in
the
general
estimate
accounted
but
one
of
the
supernumeraries
a
figure
in
dingy
attire
who
might
well
be
spared
and
who
may
consider
himself
well
paid
with
a
pound
a
week
utterances
procure
no
silence
he
has
to
pronounce
them
as
best
he
may
whilst
the
gallery
sucks
its
orange
the
pit
pares
its
nails
the
boxes
babble
and
the
stalls
yawn
amidst
these
pleasant
distractions
he
is
lucky
if
he
is
heard
at
all
and
perhaps
the
best
thing
that
can
befall
him
is
for
somebody
to
think
him
worth
the
trouble
of
a
hiss
as
for
applause
it
may
chance
with
such
men
if
they
live
long
enough
as
it
has
to
the
great
ones
who
have
preceded
them
in
their
old
age
they
are
frozen
up
within
and
quite
the
phantom
of
themselves
to
hear
the
world
applaud
the
hollow
ghost
which
blamed
the
living
man
the
great
actor
may
sink
to
sleep
soothed
by
the
memory
of
the
tears
or
laughter
he
has
evoked
and
wake
to
find
the
day
far
advanced
whose
close
is
to
witness
the
repetition
of
his
triumph
but
the
great
man
will
lie
tossing
and
turning
as
he
reflects
on
the
seemingly
unequal
war
he
is
waging
with
stupidity
and
prejudice
and
be
tempted
to
exclaim
as
milton
tells
us
he
was
with
the
sad
prophet
jeremy
is
me
my
mother
that
thou
hast
borne
me
a
man
of
strife
and
contention
the
upshot
of
all
this
is
that
it
is
a
pleasanter
thing
to
represent
greatness
than
to
be
great
but
the
actor
calling
is
not
only
pleasant
in
itself
it
gives
pleasure
to
others
in
this
respect
how
favourably
it
contrasts
with
the
three
learned
professions
few
pleasures
are
greater
than
to
witness
some
favourite
character
which
hitherto
has
been
but
vaguely
bodied
forth
by
our
sluggish
imaginations
invested
with
all
the
graces
of
living
man
or
woman
a
distinguished
man
of
letters
who
years
ago
was
wisely
selfish
enough
to
rob
the
stage
of
a
jewel
and
set
it
in
his
own
crown
has
addressed
to
his
wife
some
radiant
lines
which
are
often
on
my
lips
whose
life
is
with
mine
own
entwined
in
whom
whilst
yet
thou
wert
my
dream
i
viewed
warm
with
the
life
of
breathing
womanhood
what
shakespeare
visionary
eye
divined
pure
imogen
rosalind
kindling
with
sunshine
the
dusk
greenwood
or
changing
with
the
poet
changing
mood
juliet
or
constance
of
the
queenly
mind
but
a
truce
to
these
compliments
come
to
bury
caesar
not
to
praise
him
it
is
idle
to
shirk
disagreeable
questions
and
the
one
i
have
to
ask
is
this
the
world
been
wrong
in
regarding
with
disfavour
and
lack
of
esteem
the
great
profession
of
the
stage
that
the
world
ancient
and
modern
has
despised
the
actor
profession
can
not
be
denied
an
affecting
story
i
read
many
years
ago
in
that
elegant
and
entertaining
work
lemprière
dictionary
well
illustrates
the
feeling
of
the
roman
world
julius
decimus
laberius
was
a
roman
knight
and
dramatic
author
famous
for
his
mimes
who
had
the
misfortune
to
irritate
a
greater
julius
the
author
of
the
when
the
latter
was
at
the
height
of
his
power
caesar
casting
about
how
best
he
might
humble
his
adversary
could
think
of
nothing
better
than
to
condemn
him
to
take
a
leading
part
in
one
of
his
own
plays
laberius
entreated
in
vain
caesar
was
obdurate
and
had
his
way
laberius
played
his
part
how
lemprière
sayeth
not
but
he
also
took
his
revenge
after
the
most
effectual
of
all
fashions
the
literary
he
composed
and
delivered
a
prologue
of
considerable
power
in
which
he
records
the
act
of
spiteful
tyranny
and
which
oddly
enough
is
the
only
specimen
of
his
dramatic
art
that
has
come
down
to
us
it
contains
lines
which
though
they
do
not
seem
to
have
made
caesar
who
sat
smirking
in
the
stalls
blush
for
himself
make
us
years
afterwards
blush
for
caesar
the
only
lines
however
now
relevant
are
being
interpreted
as
follow
having
lived
sixty
years
with
honour
i
left
my
home
this
morning
a
roman
knight
but
i
shall
return
to
it
this
evening
an
infamous
alas
i
have
lived
a
day
too
long
turning
to
the
modern
world
and
to
england
we
find
it
here
the
popular
belief
that
actors
are
by
statute
rogues
vagabonds
and
sturdy
beggars
this
it
is
true
is
founded
on
a
misapprehension
of
the
effect
of
eliz
chap
which
only
provides
that
common
players
wandering
abroad
without
authority
to
play
shall
be
taken
to
be
and
vagabonds
a
distinction
which
one
would
have
thought
was
capable
of
being
perceived
even
by
the
blunted
faculties
of
the
lay
mind
footnote
see
note
at
end
of
essay
but
the
fact
that
the
popular
belief
rests
upon
a
misreading
of
an
act
of
parliament
three
hundred
years
old
does
not
affect
the
belief
but
only
makes
it
exquisitely
english
and
as
a
consequence
entirely
irrational
is
there
anything
to
be
said
in
support
of
this
once
popular
prejudice
it
may
i
think
be
supported
by
two
kinds
of
argument
one
derived
from
the
nature
of
the
case
the
other
from
the
testimony
of
actors
themselves
a
serious
objection
to
an
actor
calling
is
that
from
its
nature
it
admits
of
no
other
test
of
failure
or
success
than
the
contemporary
opinion
of
the
town
this
in
itself
must
go
far
to
rob
life
of
dignity
a
milton
may
remain
majestically
indifferent
to
the
of
and
cuckoos
asses
apes
and
dogs
but
the
actor
can
steel
himself
to
no
such
fortitude
he
can
lodge
no
appeal
to
posterity
the
owls
must
hoot
the
cuckoos
cry
the
apes
yell
and
the
dogs
bark
on
his
side
or
he
is
undone
this
is
of
course
inevitable
but
it
is
an
unfortunate
condition
of
an
artist
life
again
no
record
of
his
art
survives
to
tell
his
tale
or
account
for
his
fame
when
old
gentlemen
wax
garrulous
over
actors
dead
and
gone
young
gentlemen
grow
somnolent
chippendale
the
is
more
potent
than
garrick
the
actor
the
vivacity
of
the
latter
no
longer
charms
save
in
boswell
the
chairs
of
the
former
still
render
rest
impossible
in
a
hundred
homes
this
perhaps
is
why
no
man
of
lofty
genius
or
character
has
ever
condescended
to
remain
an
actor
his
lot
pressed
heavily
even
on
so
mercurial
a
trifler
as
david
garrick
who
has
given
utterance
to
the
feeling
in
lines
as
good
perhaps
as
any
ever
written
by
a
successful
player
painter
dead
yet
still
he
charms
the
eye
while
england
lives
his
fame
shall
never
die
but
he
who
struts
his
hour
upon
the
stage
can
scarce
protract
his
fame
thro
half
an
age
nor
pen
nor
pencil
can
the
actor
save
both
art
and
artist
have
one
common
grave
but
the
case
must
be
carried
farther
than
this
for
the
mere
fact
that
a
particular
pursuit
does
not
hold
out
any
peculiar
attractions
for
soaring
spirits
will
not
justify
us
in
calling
that
pursuit
bad
names
i
therefore
proceed
to
say
that
the
very
act
of
acting
the
art
of
mimicry
or
the
representation
of
feigned
emotions
called
up
by
sham
situations
is
in
itself
an
occupation
an
educated
man
should
be
slow
to
adopt
as
the
profession
of
a
life
i
believe
for
we
should
give
the
world
as
well
as
the
devil
its
due
that
it
is
to
a
feeling
a
settled
persuasion
of
this
sort
lying
deeper
than
the
surface
brutalities
and
snobbishnesses
visible
to
all
that
we
must
attribute
the
contempt
seemingly
so
cruel
and
so
ungrateful
the
world
has
visited
upon
actors
i
am
no
great
admirer
of
beards
be
they
never
so
luxurious
or
glossy
yet
i
own
i
can
not
regard
off
the
stage
the
closely
shaven
face
of
an
actor
without
a
feeling
of
pity
not
akin
to
love
here
so
i
can
not
help
saying
to
myself
is
a
man
who
has
adopted
a
profession
whose
very
first
demand
upon
him
is
that
he
should
destroy
his
own
identity
it
is
not
what
you
are
or
what
by
study
you
may
become
but
how
few
obstacles
you
present
to
the
getting
of
yourself
up
as
somebody
else
that
settles
the
question
of
your
fitness
for
the
stage
smoothness
of
face
mobility
of
feature
compass
of
voice
these
things
but
the
toys
of
other
trades
are
the
tools
of
this
one
boswellites
will
remember
the
name
of
tom
davies
as
one
of
frequent
occurrence
in
the
great
biography
tom
was
an
actor
of
some
repute
and
so
it
was
said
read
lost
better
than
any
man
in
england
one
evening
when
johnson
was
lounging
behind
the
scenes
at
drury
it
was
i
hope
before
his
pious
resolution
to
go
there
no
more
davies
made
his
appearance
on
his
way
to
the
stage
in
all
the
majesty
and
millinery
of
his
part
the
situation
is
picturesque
the
great
and
dingy
reality
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
immortal
and
the
bedizened
little
player
tom
said
the
great
man
and
this
is
the
whole
story
tom
and
what
art
thou
art
thou
it
may
sound
rather
like
a
tract
but
it
will
i
think
be
found
difficult
to
find
an
answer
to
the
question
consistent
with
any
true
view
of
human
dignity
our
last
argument
derived
from
the
nature
of
the
case
is
that
deliberately
to
set
yourself
as
the
occupation
of
your
life
to
amuse
the
adult
and
to
astonish
or
even
to
terrify
the
infant
population
of
your
native
land
is
to
degrade
yourself
of
the
acted
drama
is
and
always
must
be
comedy
farce
and
burlesque
we
are
bored
to
death
by
the
huge
inanities
of
life
we
observe
with
horror
that
our
interest
in
our
dinner
becomes
languid
we
consult
our
doctor
who
simulates
an
interest
in
our
stale
symptoms
and
after
a
little
talk
about
dr
diet
quiet
and
merriman
prescribes
toole
if
we
are
very
innocent
we
may
inquire
what
night
we
are
to
go
but
if
we
do
we
are
at
once
told
that
it
does
in
the
least
matter
when
we
go
for
it
is
always
equally
funny
poor
toole
to
be
made
up
every
night
as
a
safe
prescription
for
the
blues
to
make
people
laugh
is
not
necessarily
a
crime
but
to
adopt
as
your
trade
the
making
people
laugh
by
delivering
for
a
hundred
nights
together
another
jokes
in
a
costume
the
author
of
the
jokes
would
blush
to
be
seen
in
seems
to
me
a
somewhat
unworthy
proceeding
on
the
part
of
a
man
of
character
and
talent
to
amuse
the
british
public
is
a
task
of
herculean
difficulty
and
danger
for
the
blatant
monster
is
at
times
as
whimsical
and
coy
as
a
maiden
and
if
it
once
makes
up
its
mind
not
to
be
amused
nothing
will
shake
it
the
labour
is
enormous
the
sacrifice
beyond
what
is
demanded
of
saints
and
if
you
succeed
what
is
your
reward
read
the
lives
of
comedians
and
closing
them
you
will
see
what
good
reason
an
actor
has
for
exclaiming
with
the
poet
profanum
vulgus
we
now
turn
to
the
testimony
of
actors
themselves
shakespeare
is
of
course
my
first
witness
there
is
surely
significance
in
this
abide
our
question
begins
arnold
fine
sonnet
on
shakespeare
abide
our
question
thou
art
free
the
little
we
know
about
our
greatest
poet
has
become
a
commonplace
it
is
a
striking
tribute
to
the
endless
loquacity
of
man
and
a
proof
how
that
great
creature
is
not
to
be
deprived
of
his
talk
that
he
has
managed
to
write
quite
as
much
about
there
being
nothing
to
write
about
as
he
could
have
written
about
shakespeare
if
the
author
of
had
been
as
great
an
egoist
as
rousseau
the
fact
however
remains
that
he
who
has
told
us
most
about
ourselves
whose
genius
has
made
the
whole
civilized
world
kin
has
told
us
nothing
about
himself
except
that
he
hated
and
despised
the
stage
to
say
that
he
has
told
us
this
is
not
i
think
any
exaggeration
i
have
of
course
in
mind
the
often
quoted
lines
to
be
found
in
that
sweet
treasury
of
melodious
verse
and
deep
feeling
the
of
shakespeare
the
begins
thus
is
true
i
have
gone
here
and
there
and
made
myself
a
motley
to
the
view
gor
my
own
thoughts
sold
cheap
what
is
most
dear
made
old
offences
of
affections
new
and
the
for
my
sake
do
thou
with
fortune
chide
the
guilty
goddess
of
my
harmful
deeds
that
did
not
better
for
my
life
provide
than
public
means
which
public
manners
breeds
thence
comes
it
that
my
name
receives
a
brand
and
almost
thence
my
nature
is
subdued
to
what
it
works
on
like
the
dyer
hand
pity
me
then
and
wish
i
were
renewed
it
is
not
much
short
of
three
centuries
since
those
lines
were
written
but
they
seem
still
to
bubble
with
a
scorn
which
may
indeed
be
called
immortal
cheap
what
is
most
dear
there
compressed
in
half
a
line
is
the
whole
case
against
an
calling
but
it
may
be
said
shakespeare
was
but
a
poor
actor
he
could
write
and
you
like
but
when
it
came
to
casting
the
parts
the
ghost
in
the
one
and
old
adam
in
the
other
were
the
best
he
could
aspire
to
verbose
biographers
of
shakespeare
in
their
dire
extremity
and
naturally
desirous
of
writing
a
big
book
about
a
big
man
have
remarked
at
length
that
it
was
highly
creditable
to
shakespeare
that
he
was
not
or
at
all
events
that
it
does
not
appear
that
he
was
jealous
after
the
true
theatrical
tradition
of
his
more
successful
brethren
of
the
buskin
it
surely
might
have
occured
even
to
a
verbose
biographer
in
his
direst
need
that
to
have
had
the
wit
to
write
and
actually
to
have
written
the
soliloquies
in
might
console
a
man
under
heavier
afflictions
than
the
knowledge
that
in
the
popular
estimate
somebody
else
spouted
those
soliloquies
better
than
he
did
himself
i
can
as
easily
fancy
milton
jealous
of
tom
davies
as
shakespeare
of
richard
burbage
but
good
bad
or
indifferent
shakespeare
was
an
actor
and
as
such
i
tender
his
testimony
i
now
for
really
this
matter
must
be
cut
short
summon
all
the
actors
and
actresses
who
have
ever
strutted
their
little
hour
on
the
stage
and
put
to
them
the
following
comprehensive
question
is
there
in
your
midst
one
who
had
an
honest
hearty
downright
pride
and
pleasure
in
your
calling
or
do
not
you
all
tell
the
truth
mournfully
echo
the
lines
of
your
great
master
whom
nevertheless
you
never
really
cared
for
and
with
him
fortunes
chide
that
did
not
better
for
your
lives
provide
than
public
means
which
public
manners
breeds
they
all
assent
with
wonderful
unanimity
but
seriously
i
know
of
no
recorded
exception
unless
it
be
thomas
betterton
who
held
the
stage
for
half
a
century
from
to
and
who
still
lives
as
much
as
an
actor
can
in
the
pages
of
colley
cibber
he
was
a
man
apparently
of
simple
character
for
he
had
only
one
all
his
life
who
else
is
there
read
macready
the
king
arthur
of
the
stage
you
will
find
there
i
am
sorry
to
say
all
the
faults
if
faults
they
can
be
called
which
seem
rather
hard
necessities
the
discolouring
of
the
dyer
hand
greedy
hungering
after
applause
endless
egotism
grudging
praise
all
are
there
not
perhaps
in
the
tropical
luxuriance
they
have
attained
elsewhere
but
plain
enough
but
do
we
not
also
find
deeply
engrained
and
constant
a
sense
of
degradation
a
longing
to
escape
from
the
stage
for
ever
he
did
not
like
his
children
to
come
and
see
him
act
and
was
always
regretting
heaven
help
him
that
he
was
a
look
upon
this
picture
and
on
that
here
we
have
macbeth
that
mighty
thane
hamlet
the
intellectual
symbol
of
the
whole
world
of
modern
thought
strafford
in
robert
browning
fine
play
splendid
dresses
crowded
theatres
beautiful
women
royal
audiences
and
on
the
other
side
a
rusty
gown
a
musty
wig
a
fusty
court
a
deaf
judge
an
indifferent
jury
a
dispute
about
a
bill
of
lading
and
ten
guineas
on
your
brief
which
you
have
not
been
paid
and
which
you
ca
recover
why
hyperion
to
a
satyr
again
we
find
siddons
writing
of
her
sister
marriage
have
lost
one
of
the
sweetest
companions
in
the
world
she
has
married
a
respectable
man
though
of
small
fortune
i
thank
god
she
is
off
the
stage
what
is
this
but
to
say
the
most
humdrum
of
existences
with
the
most
respectable
of
men
than
to
be
upon
the
stage
the
volunteered
testimony
of
actors
is
both
large
in
bulk
and
valuable
in
quality
and
it
is
all
on
my
side
their
involuntary
testimony
i
pass
over
lightly
far
be
from
me
the
disgusting
and
ungenerous
task
of
raking
up
a
heap
of
the
weaknesses
vanities
and
miserablenesses
of
actors
and
actresses
dead
and
gone
after
life
fitful
fever
they
sleep
i
trust
well
and
in
common
candour
it
ought
never
to
be
forgotten
that
whilst
it
has
always
been
the
fashion
until
one
memorable
day
froude
ran
amuck
of
it
for
biographers
to
shroud
their
biographees
the
american
minister
must
bear
the
brunt
of
this
word
on
his
broad
shoulders
in
a
crape
veil
of
respectability
the
records
of
the
stage
have
been
written
in
another
spirit
we
always
know
the
worst
of
an
actor
seldom
his
best
david
garrick
was
a
better
man
than
lord
eldon
and
macready
was
at
least
as
good
as
dickens
there
is
however
one
portion
of
this
body
of
involuntary
testimony
on
which
i
must
be
allowed
to
rely
for
it
may
be
referred
to
without
offence
our
dramatic
literature
is
our
greatest
literature
it
is
the
best
thing
we
have
done
dante
may
milton
but
shakespeare
surpasses
both
he
is
our
finest
achievement
his
plays
our
noblest
possession
the
things
in
the
world
most
worth
thinking
about
to
live
daily
in
his
company
to
study
his
works
with
minute
and
loving
care
in
no
spirit
of
pedantry
searching
for
double
endings
but
in
order
to
discover
their
secret
and
to
make
the
spoken
word
tell
upon
the
hearts
of
man
and
woman
this
might
have
been
expected
to
produce
great
intellectual
if
not
moral
results
the
most
magnificent
compliment
ever
paid
by
man
to
woman
is
undoubtedly
steele
to
the
lady
elizabeth
hastings
love
her
wrote
he
a
liberal
education
as
much
might
surely
be
said
of
shakespeare
but
what
are
the
facts
the
ugly
hateful
facts
despite
this
great
advantage
this
close
familiarity
with
the
noblest
and
best
in
our
literature
the
taste
of
actors
their
critical
judgment
always
has
been
and
still
is
if
not
beneath
contempt
at
all
events
far
below
the
average
intelligence
of
their
day
by
taste
i
do
not
mean
taste
in
flounces
and
in
furbelows
tunics
and
stockings
but
in
the
weightier
matters
of
the
truly
sublime
and
the
essentially
ridiculous
macbeth
is
undoubtedly
a
fine
performance
and
yet
that
great
actor
as
the
result
of
his
study
has
placed
it
on
record
that
he
thinks
the
scene
ought
to
be
assigned
to
macbeth
instead
of
to
his
wife
shades
of
shakespeare
and
siddons
what
think
you
of
that
it
is
a
strange
fatality
but
a
proof
of
the
inherent
pettiness
of
the
actor
art
that
though
it
places
its
votary
in
the
very
midst
of
literary
and
artistic
influences
and
of
necessity
informs
him
of
the
best
and
worthiest
he
is
yet
so
far
as
his
own
culture
is
concerned
left
out
in
the
cold
art
slave
not
her
child
what
have
the
devotees
of
the
drama
taught
us
nothing
it
is
we
who
have
taught
them
we
go
first
and
they
come
lumbering
after
it
was
not
from
the
stage
the
voice
arose
bidding
us
recognise
the
supremacy
of
shakespeare
genius
actors
first
ignored
him
then
hideously
mutilated
him
and
though
now
occasionally
compelled
out
of
deference
to
the
taste
of
the
day
to
forego
their
traditions
to
forswear
their
tate
and
brady
emendations
in
their
heart
of
hearts
they
love
him
not
and
it
is
with
a
light
step
and
a
smiling
face
that
our
great
living
tragedian
flings
aside
hamlet
tunic
or
shylock
gaberdine
to
revel
in
the
melodramatic
glories
of
and
corsican
our
gratitude
is
due
in
this
great
matter
to
men
of
letters
not
to
actors
if
it
be
asked
have
actors
to
do
with
literature
and
criticism
i
answer
and
add
is
my
case
but
the
notorious
bad
taste
of
actors
is
not
entirely
due
to
their
living
outside
literature
with
its
words
for
ever
upon
their
lips
but
none
of
its
truths
engraven
on
their
hearts
it
may
partly
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
for
the
purposes
of
an
ambitious
actor
bad
plays
are
the
best
in
reading
actors
lives
nothing
strikes
you
more
than
their
delight
in
making
a
hit
in
some
part
nobody
ever
thought
anything
of
before
garrick
was
proud
past
all
endurance
of
his
beverley
in
the
and
one
can
easily
see
why
until
people
saw
garrick
beverley
they
did
think
there
was
anything
in
the
nor
was
there
except
what
garrick
put
there
this
is
called
creating
a
part
and
he
is
the
greatest
actor
who
creates
most
parts
but
genius
in
the
author
of
the
play
is
a
terrible
obstacle
in
the
way
of
an
actor
who
aspires
to
identify
himself
once
and
for
all
with
the
leading
part
in
it
irving
may
act
hamlet
well
or
ill
and
for
my
part
i
think
he
acts
it
exceedingly
well
but
behind
hamlet
as
behind
everybody
else
hamlet
there
looms
a
greater
hamlet
than
them
all
shakespeare
hamlet
the
real
hamlet
but
irving
mathias
is
quite
another
kettle
of
fish
all
of
irving
own
catching
who
ever
on
leaving
the
lyceum
after
seeing
was
heard
to
exclaim
is
all
mighty
fine
but
that
is
not
my
idea
of
mathias
do
not
we
all
feel
that
without
irving
there
could
be
no
mathias
we
best
like
doing
what
we
do
best
and
an
actor
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
preferring
the
task
of
making
much
of
a
very
little
to
that
of
making
little
of
a
great
deal
as
for
actresses
it
surely
would
be
the
height
of
ungenerosity
to
blame
a
woman
for
following
the
only
regular
profession
commanding
fame
and
fortune
the
kind
consideration
of
man
has
left
open
to
her
for
two
centuries
women
have
been
free
to
follow
this
profession
onerous
and
exacting
though
it
be
and
by
doing
so
have
won
the
rapturous
applause
of
generations
of
men
who
are
all
ready
enough
to
believe
that
where
their
pleasure
is
involved
no
risks
of
life
or
honour
are
too
great
for
a
woman
to
run
it
is
only
when
the
latter
tired
of
the
shams
of
life
would
pursue
the
realities
that
we
become
alive
to
the
fact
hitherto
i
suppose
studiously
concealed
from
us
how
frail
and
feeble
a
creature
she
is
lastly
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
we
are
discussing
a
question
of
casuistry
one
which
is
o
the
conscience
and
where
consequently
words
are
all
important
is
an
actor
calling
an
eminently
worthy
one
that
is
the
question
it
may
be
lawful
useful
delightful
but
is
it
worthy
an
actor
life
is
an
artist
life
no
artist
however
eminent
has
more
than
one
life
or
does
anything
worth
doing
in
that
life
unless
he
is
prepared
to
spend
it
royally
in
the
service
of
his
art
caring
for
nought
else
is
an
actor
art
worth
the
price
i
answer
no
vagabonds
and
players
the
statute
law
on
this
subject
is
not
without
interest
stated
shortly
it
stands
thus
by
eliz
it
was
enacted
all
persons
calling
themselves

begging

as
by
this

is
in
that

appointed
such

punyshment
was

follows

after
which
whipping
the
same
person
shall
have
a
testimonyall
testifying
that
he
has
been
punyshed
according
to
law
this
statute
was
repealed
by
anne
which
however
includes
within
its
new
scope
players
of
interludes
and
names
no
exceptions
the
whipping
continues
but
there
is
an
alternative
in
the

be
stript

middle
and
be
openly
whipped
until
his

be

or
may
be
sent

the
house
of

geo
ii
repeals
a
previous
statute
of
the
same
king
which
had
repealed
the
statute
of
anne
and
provides
that
common
players
of
interludes
and
all
persons
who
shall
for
hire
gain
or

act
represent
or
perform
any
interlude
tragedy
comedy
opera
play
farce
or
other
entertainment
of
the
stage
not
being
authorized
by
law
shall
be
deemed
rogues
and
vagabonds
within
the
true
meaning
of
the
act
the
punishment
was
to
be
whipt
or
to
be
sent
to
the
house
of
correction
this
act
has
been
repealed
and
the
law
is
regulated
by
geo
iv
which
makes
no
mention
of
actors
who
are
therefore
now
wholly
quit
of
this
odious
imputation
a
rogue
memoirs
one
is
often
tempted
of
the
devil
to
forswear
the
study
of
history
altogether
as
the
pursuit
of
the
unknowable
is
it
possible
he
whispers
in
our
ear
as
we
stand
gloomily
regarding
the
portly
volumes
without
which
no
gentleman
library
is
complete
is
it
possible
to
suppose
that
you
have
there
on
your
shelves
the
actual
facts
of
history
a
true
record
of
what
men
dead
long
ago
felt
and
thought
yet
if
we
have
not
i
for
one
though
of
a
literary
turn
would
sooner
spend
my
leisure
playing
skittles
with
boors
than
in
reading
sonorous
lies
in
stout
volumes
is
not
so
much
wilily
insinuates
the
tempter
these
renowned
authors
lack
knowledge
their
habit
of
giving
an
occasional
reference
though
the
verification
of
these
is
usually
left
to
the
malignancy
of
a
rival
and
less
popular
historian
argues
at
least
some
reading
no
what
is
wanting
is
ignorance
carefully
acquired
and
studiously
maintained
this
is
no
paradox
to
carry
the
truisms
theories
laws
language
of
along
with
you
in
your
historical
pursuits
is
to
turn
the
muse
of
history
upside
down
a
most
disrespectful
proceeding
and
yet
to
ignore
them
to
forget
all
about
them
to
hang
them
up
with
your
hat
and
coat
in
the
hall
to
remain
there
whilst
you
sit
in
the
library
composing
your
immortal
work
which
is
so
happily
to
combine
all
that
is
best
in
gibbon
and
macaulay
a
sneerless
gibbon
and
an
impartial
macaulay
is
a
task
which
if
it
be
not
impossible
is
at
all
events
of
huge
difficulty
another
blemish
in
english
historical
work
has
been
noticed
by
the
rev
charles
kingsley
and
may
therefore
be
referred
to
by
me
without
offence
your
standard
historians
having
no
unnatural
regard
for
their
most
indefatigable
readers
the
wives
and
daughters
of
england
feel
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
pass
over
as
unfit
for
dainty
ears
and
dulcet
tones
facts
and
rumours
of
facts
which
none
the
less
often
determined
events
by
stirring
the
strong
feelings
of
your
ancestors
whose
conduct
unless
explained
by
this
light
must
remain
enigmatical
when
to
these
anachronisms
of
thought
and
omissions
of
fact
you
have
added
the
dishonesty
of
the
partisan
historian
and
the
false
glamour
of
the
picturesque
one
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
proceed
to
find
the
present
value
of
history
thus
far
the
enemy
of
mankind
an
admirable
lady
orator
is
reported
lately
to
have
exeter
hall
by
observing
a
low
but
penetrating
voice
that
the
devil
was
a
very
stupid
person
it
is
true
that
ben
jonson
is
on
the
side
of
the
lady
but
i
am
far
too
orthodox
to
entertain
any
such
opinion
and
though
i
have
in
this
instance
of
history
so
far
resisted
him
as
to
have
refrained
from
sending
my
standard
historians
to
the
auction
mart
where
indeed
with
the
almost
single
exception
of
grote
history
of
greece
the
octavo
edition
in
twelve
volumes
prices
rule
so
low
as
to
make
cartage
a
consideration
i
have
still
of
late
found
myself
turning
off
the
turnpike
of
history
to
loiter
down
the
primrose
paths
of
men
memoirs
of
themselves
and
their
times
here
at
least
so
we
argue
we
are
comparatively
safe
anachronisms
of
thought
are
impossible
omissions
out
of
regard
for
female
posterity
unlikely
and
as
for
party
spirit
if
found
it
forms
part
of
what
lawyers
call
the
and
has
therefore
a
value
of
its
own
against
the
perils
of
the
picturesque
who
will
insure
us
but
when
we
have
said
all
this
and
sick
of
prosing
would
begin
reading
the
number
of
really
readable
memoirs
is
soon
found
to
be
but
few
this
is
indeed
unfortunate
for
it
launches
us
off
on
another
by
provoking
the
question
what
makes
memoirs
interesting
is
it
necessary
that
they
should
be
the
record
of
a
noble
character
certainly
not
we
remember
pepys
who
well
never
mind
what
he
does
we
call
to
mind
cellini
runs
behind
a
and
with
address
sticks
a
dagger
in
the
nape
of
his
neck
and
long
afterwards
records
the
fact
almost
with
reverence
in
his
life
story
can
anything
be
more
revolting
than
some
portions
of
the
revelation
benjamin
franklin
was
pleased
to
make
of
himself
in
writing
and
what
about
rousseau
yet
when
we
have
pleaded
guilty
for
these
men
a
modern
savonarola
who
had
persuaded
us
to
make
a
bonfire
of
their
works
would
do
well
to
keep
a
sharp
lest
at
the
last
moment
we
should
be
found
substituting
on
the
creed
for
pepys
for
cellini
john
foster
essays
for
franklin
and
bridgewater
treatise
for
rousseau
neither
will
it
do
to
suppose
that
the
interest
of
a
memoir
depends
on
its
writer
having
been
concerned
in
great
affairs
or
lived
in
stirring
times
the
dullest
memoirs
written
even
in
english
and
not
excepting
those
maimed
records
of
life
known
as
biography
are
the
work
of
men
of
the
order
who
having
been
mixed
up
in
events
which
the
newspapers
of
the
day
chronicled
as
intelligence
were
not
unnaturally
led
to
cherish
the
belief
that
people
would
like
to
have
from
their
pens
full
true
and
particular
accounts
of
all
that
then
happened
or
as
they
if
moderns
would
probably
prefer
to
say
transpired
but
the
world
whatever
an
exeter
hall
may
say
of
her
old
associate
the
devil
is
not
a
stupid
person
and
declines
to
be
taken
in
twice
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
most
painstaking
and
trustworthy
accounts
of
deceased
cabinets
and
silenced
conferences
goes
journeying
along
her
broad
way
chuckling
over
some
old
joke
in
boswell
and
reading
with
fresh
delight
the
letters
of
cowper
and
lamb
how
then
does
a
man
be
he
good
or
bad
big
or
little
a
philosopher
or
a
fribble
paul
or
horace
walpole
make
his
memoirs
interesting
to
say
that
the
one
thing
needful
is
individuality
is
not
quite
enough
to
be
an
individual
is
the
inevitable
and
in
most
cases
the
unenviable
lot
of
every
child
of
adam
each
one
of
us
has
like
a
tin
soldier
a
stand
of
his
own
to
have
an
individuality
is
no
sort
of
distinction
but
to
be
able
to
make
it
felt
in
writing
is
not
only
distinction
but
under
favouring
circumstances
immortality
have
we
not
all
some
correspondents
though
probably
but
few
from
whom
we
never
receive
a
letter
without
feeling
sure
that
we
shall
find
inside
the
envelope
something
written
that
will
make
us
either
glow
with
the
warmth
or
shiver
with
the
cold
of
our
correspondent
life
but
how
many
other
people
are
to
be
found
good
honest
people
too
who
no
sooner
take
pen
in
hand
than
they
stamp
unreality
on
every
word
they
write
it
is
a
hard
fate
but
they
can
not
escape
it
they
may
be
as
literal
as
the
late
earl
stanhope
as
painstaking
as
bishop
stubbs
as
much
in
earnest
as
the
prime
minister
their
lives
may
be
noble
their
aims
high
but
no
sooner
do
they
seek
to
narrate
to
us
their
story
than
we
find
it
is
not
to
be
to
hearken
to
them
is
past
praying
for
we
turn
from
them
as
from
a
guest
who
has
outstayed
his
welcome
their
writing
wearies
irritates
disgusts
here
then
at
last
we
have
the
two
classes
of
memoir
writers
those
who
manage
to
make
themselves
felt
and
those
who
do
not
of
the
latter
a
very
little
is
a
great
deal
too
much
of
the
former
we
can
never
have
enough
what
a
liar
was
benvenuto
cellini
who
can
believe
a
word
he
says
to
hang
a
dog
on
his
oath
would
be
a
judicial
murder
yet
when
we
lay
down
his
memoirs
and
let
our
thoughts
travel
back
to
those
days
he
tells
us
of
there
we
see
him
standing
in
bold
relief
against
the
black
sky
of
the
past
the
very
man
he
was
not
more
surely
did
he
with
that
rare
skill
of
his
stamp
the
image
of
clement
vii
on
the
papal
currency
than
he
did
the
impress
of
his
own
singular
personality
upon
every
word
he
spoke
and
every
sentence
he
wrote
we
ought
of
course
to
hate
him
but
do
we
a
murderer
he
has
written
himself
down
a
liar
he
stands
of
being
were
anyone
in
the
nether
world
bold
enough
to
call
him
thief
it
may
be
doubted
whether
rhadamanthus
would
award
him
the
damages
for
which
we
may
be
certain
he
would
loudly
clamour
why
do
we
not
hate
him
listen
to
him
my
uttering
these
words
there
was
a
general
outcry
the
noblemen
affirming
that
i
promised
too
much
but
one
of
them
who
was
a
great
philosopher
said
in
my
favour
from
the
admirable
symmetry
of
shape
and
happy
physiognomy
of
this
young
man
i
venture
to
engage
that
he
will
perform
all
he
promises
and
more
the
pope
replied
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
then
calling
trajano
his
gentleman
of
the
he
ordered
him
to
fetch
me
five
hundred
ducats
and
so
it
always
ended
suspicions
aroused
most
reasonably
allayed
most
unreasonably
and
then
ducats
he
deserved
hanging
but
he
died
in
his
bed
he
wrote
his
own
memoirs
after
a
fashion
that
ought
to
have
brought
posthumous
justice
upon
him
and
made
them
a
literary
gibbet
on
which
he
should
swing
a
creaking
horror
for
all
time
but
nothing
of
the
sort
has
happened
the
rascal
is
so
symmetrical
and
his
physiognomy
as
it
gleams
upon
us
through
the
centuries
so
happy
that
we
can
not
withhold
our
ducats
though
we
may
accompany
the
gift
with
a
shower
of
abuse
this
only
proves
the
profundity
of
an
observation
made
by
bagehot
a
man
who
carried
away
into
the
next
world
more
originality
of
thought
than
is
now
to
be
found
in
the
three
estates
of
the
realm
whilst
remarking
upon
the
extraordinary
reputation
of
the
late
francis
horner
and
the
trifling
cost
he
was
put
to
in
supporting
it
bagehot
said
that
it
proved
the
advantage
of
an
atmosphere
the
common
air
of
heaven
sharpens
men
judgments
poor
horner
but
for
that
kept
atmosphere
of
his
always
surrounding
him
would
have
been
bluntly
asked
he
had
done
since
he
was
breeched
and
in
reply
he
could
only
have
muttered
something
about
the
currency
as
for
our
especial
rogue
cellini
the
question
would
probably
have
assumed
this
shape
name
the
crime
you
have
not
committed
and
account
for
the
omission
but
these
awkward
questions
are
not
put
to
the
lucky
people
who
keep
their
own
atmospheres
the
critics
before
they
can
get
at
them
have
to
step
out
of
the
everyday
air
where
only
achievements
count
and
the
decalogue
still
goes
for
something
into
the
kept
atmosphere
which
they
have
no
sooner
breathed
than
they
begin
to
see
things
differently
and
to
measure
the
object
thus
surrounded
with
a
tape
of
its
own
manufacture
horner
poor
ugly
a
man
neither
of
words
nor
deeds
becomes
one
of
our
great
men
a
nation
mourns
his
loss
and
erects
his
statue
in
the
abbey
bagehot
gives
several
instances
of
the
same
kind
but
he
does
not
mention
cellini
who
is
however
in
his
own
way
an
admirable
example
you
open
his
book
a
pharisee
of
the
pharisees
lying
indeed
why
you
hate
prevarication
as
for
murder
your
friends
know
you
too
well
to
mention
the
subject
in
your
hearing
except
in
immediate
connection
with
capital
punishment
you
are
of
course
willing
to
make
some
allowance
for
cellini
time
and
place
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
italy
you
remark
shall
have
strict
justice
at
my
hands
so
you
say
as
you
settle
yourself
in
your
chair
and
begin
to
read
we
seem
to
hear
the
rascal
laughing
in
his
grave
his
spirit
breathes
upon
you
from
his
book
peeps
at
you
roguishly
as
you
turn
the
pages
his
atmosphere
surrounds
you
you
smile
when
you
ought
to
frown
chuckle
when
you
should
groan
and
o
final
triumph
laugh
aloud
when
if
you
had
a
rag
of
principle
left
you
would
fling
the
book
into
the
fire
your
poor
moral
sense
turns
away
with
a
sigh
and
patiently
awaits
the
conclusion
of
the
second
volume
how
cautiously
does
he
begin
how
gently
does
he
win
your
ear
by
his
seductive
piety
i
quote
from
roscoe
translation
is
a
duty
incumbent
on
upright
and
credible
men
of
all
ranks
who
have
performed
anything
noble
or
praiseworthy
to
record
in
their
own
writing
the
events
of
their
lives
yet
they
should
not
commence
this
honourable
task
before
they
have
passed
their
fortieth
year
such
at
least
is
my
opinion
now
that
i
have
completed
my
year
and
am
settled
in
florence
where
considering
the
numerous
ills
that
constantly
attend
human
life
i
perceive
that
i
have
never
before
been
so
free
from
vexations
and
calamities
or
possessed
of
so
great
a
share
of
content
and
health
as
at
this
period
looking
back
on
some
delightful
and
happy
events
of
my
life
and
on
many
misfortunes
so
truly
overwhelming
that
the
appalling
retrospect
makes
me
wonder
how
i
have
reached
this
age
in
vigour
and
prosperity
through
god
goodness
i
have
resolved
to
publish
an
account
of
my
life
and
i
must
in
commencing
my
narrative
satisfy
the
public
on
some
few
points
to
which
its
curiosity
is
usually
directed
the
first
of
which
is
to
ascertain
whether
a
man
is
descended
from
a
virtuous
and
ancient
family
i
shall
therefore
now
proceed
to
inform
the
reader
how
it
pleased
god
that
i
should
come
into
the
world
so
you
read
on
page
what
you
read
on
page
is
this
after
sunset
about
eight
as
this
musqueteer
stood
at
his
door
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
when
he
had
done
supper
i
with
great
address
came
close
up
to
him
with
a
long
dagger
and
gave
him
a
violent
stroke
which
i
aimed
at
his
neck
he
instantly
turned
round
and
the
blow
falling
directly
upon
his
left
shoulder
broke
the
whole
bone
of
it
upon
which
he
dropped
his
sword
quite
overcome
by
the
pain
and
took
to
his
heels
i
pursued
and
in
four
steps
came
up
with
him
when
raising
the
dagger
over
his
head
which
he
lowered
down
i
hit
him
exactly
upon
the
nape
of
the
neck
the
weapon
penetrated
so
deep
that
though
i
made
a
great
effort
to
recover
it
again
i
found
it
impossible
so
much
for
murder
now
for
manslaughter
or
rather
cellini
notion
of
manslaughter
entered
an
apothecary
shop
at
the
corner
of
the
chiavica
about
some
business
and
stayed
there
for
some
time
i
was
told
he
had
boasted
of
having
bullied
me
but
it
turned
out
a
fatal
adventure
to
him
just
as
i
arrived
at
that
quarter
he
was
coming
out
of
the
shop
and
his
bravoes
having
made
an
opening
formed
a
circle
round
him
i
thereupon
clapped
my
hand
to
a
sharp
dagger
and
having
forced
my
way
through
the
file
of
ruffians
laid
hold
of
him
by
the
throat
so
quickly
and
with
such
presence
of
mind
that
there
was
not
one
of
his
friends
could
defend
him
i
pulled
him
towards
me
to
give
him
a
blow
in
front
but
he
turned
his
face
about
through
excess
of
terror
so
that
i
wounded
him
exactly
under
the
ear
and
upon
repeating
my
blow
he
fell
down
dead
it
had
never
been
my
intention
to
kill
him
but
blows
are
not
always
under
command
we
must
all
feel
that
it
would
never
have
done
to
have
begun
with
these
passages
but
long
before
the
page
has
been
reached
cellini
has
retreated
into
his
own
atmosphere
and
the
scales
of
justice
have
been
hopelessly
tampered
with
that
such
a
man
as
this
encountered
suffering
in
the
course
of
his
life
should
be
matter
for
satisfaction
to
every
mind
but
somehow
or
another
you
find
yourself
pitying
the
fellow
as
he
narrates
the
hardships
he
endured
in
the
castle
of
angelo
he
is
so
symmetrical
a
rascal
just
hear
him
listen
to
what
he
says
well
on
in
the
second
volume
after
the
little
incidents
already
quoted
at
length
recovered
my
strength
and
vigour
after
i
had
composed
myself
and
resumed
my
cheerfulness
of
mind
i
continued
to
read
my
bible
and
so
accustomed
my
eyes
to
that
darkness
that
though
i
was
at
first
able
to
read
only
an
hour
and
a
half
i
could
at
length
read
three
hours
i
then
reflected
on
the
wonderful
power
of
the
almighty
upon
the
hearts
of
simple
men
who
had
carried
their
enthusiasm
so
far
as
to
believe
firmly
that
god
would
indulge
them
in
all
they
wished
for
and
i
promised
myself
the
assistance
of
the
most
high
as
well
through
his
mercy
as
on
account
of
my
innocence
thus
turning
constantly
to
the
supreme
being
sometimes
in
prayer
sometimes
in
silent
meditation
on
the
divine
goodness
i
was
totally
engrossed
by
these
heavenly
reflections
and
came
to
take
such
delight
in
pious
meditations
that
i
no
longer
thought
of
past
misfortunes
on
the
contrary
i
was
all
day
long
singing
psalms
and
many
other
compositions
of
mine
in
which
i
celebrated
and
praised
the
deity
thus
torn
from
their
context
these
passages
may
seem
to
supply
the
best
possible
falsification
of
the
previous
statement
that
cellini
told
the
truth
about
himself
judged
by
these
passages
alone
he
may
appear
a
hypocrite
of
an
unusually
odious
description
but
it
is
only
necessary
to
read
his
book
to
dispel
that
notion
he
tells
lies
about
other
people
he
repeats
long
conversations
sounding
his
own
praises
during
which
as
his
own
narrative
shows
he
was
not
present
he
exaggerates
his
own
exploits
his
sufferings
even
it
may
be
his
crimes
but
when
we
lay
down
his
book
we
feel
we
are
saying
to
a
man
whom
we
know
he
has
introduced
himself
to
us
and
though
doubtless
we
prefer
saints
to
sinners
we
may
be
forgiven
for
liking
the
company
of
a
live
rogue
better
than
that
of
the
and
empty
labelled
with
distinguished
names
who
are
to
be
found
doing
duty
for
men
in
the
works
of
our
standard
historians
what
would
we
not
give
to
know
julius
caesar
one
half
as
well
as
we
know
this
outrageous
rascal
the
saints
of
the
earth
too
how
shadowy
they
are
which
of
them
do
we
really
know
excepting
one
or
two
ancient
and
modern
quietists
there
is
hardly
one
amongst
the
whole
number
who
being
dead
yet
speaketh
their
memoirs
far
too
often
only
reveal
to
us
a
hazy
something
certainly
not
recognisable
as
a
man
this
is
generally
the
fault
of
their
editors
who
though
men
themselves
confine
their
editorial
duties
to
going
up
and
down
the
diaries
and
papers
of
the
departed
saint
and
obliterating
all
human
touches
this
they
do
for
the
prevention
of
scandals
and
one
can
not
deny
that
they
attain
their
end
though
they
pay
dearly
for
it
i
shall
never
forget
the
start
i
gave
when
on
reading
some
old
book
about
india
i
came
across
an
jest
of
henry
martyn
the
thought
of
henry
martyn
laughing
over
the
walnuts
and
the
wine
was
almost
as
robert
browning
unknown
painter
says
wildly
dear
and
to
this
day
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
there
must
be
a
mistake
somewhere
to
return
to
cellini
and
to
conclude
on
laying
down
his
let
us
be
careful
to
recall
our
banished
moral
sense
and
make
peace
with
her
by
passing
a
final
judgment
on
this
desperate
sinner
which
perhaps
after
all
we
can
not
do
better
than
by
employing
language
of
his
own
concerning
a
monk
a
of
his
who
never
so
far
as
appears
murdered
anybody
but
of
whom
cellini
none
the
less
felt
himself
entitled
to
say
admired
his
shining
qualities
but
his
odious
vices
i
freely
censured
and
held
in
abhorrence
the
via

the
world
is
governed
by
logic
truth
as
well
as
providence
is
always
on
the
side
of
the
strongest
battalions
an
illogical
opinion
only
requires
rope
enough
to
hang
itself
middle
men
may
often
seem
to
be
earning
for
themselves
a
place
in
universal
biography
and
middle
positions
frequently
seem
to
afford
the
final
solution
of
vexed
questions
but
this
double
delusion
seldom
outlives
a
generation
the
world
wearies
of
the
men
for
attractive
as
their
characters
may
be
they
are
for
ever
telling
us
generally
at
great
length
how
it
comes
about
that
they
stand
just
where
they
do
and
we
soon
tire
of
explanations
and
forget
apologists
the
positions
too
once
hailed
with
such
acclaim
so
eagerly
recognised
as
the
true
refuges
for
poor
mortals
anxious
to
avoid
being
run
over
by
logicians
how
untenable
do
they
soon
appear
how
quickly
do
they
grow
antiquated
how
completely
they
are
forgotten
the
via

alluring
as
is

direction
imposing
as
are

is
after
all
only
what
londoners
call
a
blind
alley
leading
nowhere
says
one
of
the
most
eloquent
and
yet
exact
of
modern
writers
the
great
principle
of
order
in
thinking
it
reduces
a
chaos
into
harmony
it
catalogues
the
accumulations
of
knowledge
it
maps
out
for
us
the
relations
of
its
separate
departments
it
enables
the
independent
intellects
of
many
acting
and
on
each
other
to
bring
their
collective
force
to
bear
upon
the
same
if
language
is
an
inestimable
gift
to
man
the
logical
faculty
prepares
it
for
our
use
though
it
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
ascertain
truth
still
it
teaches
us
the
in
which
truth
lies
and
propositions
lie
towards
each
nor
is
it
a
slight
benefit
to
know
what
is
needed
for
the
proof
of
a
point
what
is
wanting
in
a
theory
how
a

hangs
together
what

follow
if
it
be

in
the

this

principle
of
order
in

is
what
we
are
too
apt
to
forget
us
cry
many
in
our
opinions
and
let
who
will
be
logical
an
englishman
creed
is
compromise
his
extravagance
we
are
not
saved
by
syllogism
possibly
not
but
yet
there
can
be
no
safety
in
an
illogical
position
and
one
chances
of
snug
quarters
in
eternity
can
not
surely
be
bettered
by
our
believing

the
same

propositions
but
talk
as
we
may
for
the
bulk
of
mankind
it
will
doubtless
always
remain

that

contradictory
darwin

both
right
between
the
gospel

and

there
is
no
difference
if
the
too
apparent
absurdity
of
this
is
pressed
home
the
baffled
illogician
persecuted
in
one
position
flees
into
another
and
may
be
heard
assuring
his
tormentor
that
in
a
period
like
the
present
which
is
so
notoriously
transitional
a
logician
is
as
much
out
of
place
as
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
and
that
unless
he
is
quiet
and
keeps
his
tail
well
wrapped
round
his
legs
the
mischief
he
will
do
to
his
china
creeds
and
delicate
porcelain
opinions
is
shocking
to
contemplate
but
this
excuse
is
no
longer
admissible
the
age
has
remained
transitional
so
unconscionably
long
that
we
can
not
consent
to
forego
the
use
of
logic
any
longer
for
a
decade
or
two
it
was
all
well
enough
but
when
it
comes
to
fourscore
years
one
patience
gets
exhausted
carlyle
celebrated
essay
in
which
this
transitional
period
is
diagnosed
with
unrivalled
acumen
is
half
a
century
old
men
have
been
born
in
it
have
grown
old
in
it
have
died
in
it
it
has
outlived
the
old
court
of
chancery
it
is
high
time
the
spurs
of
logic
were
applied
to
its
sides
notwithstanding
the
obstinate
preference
the
of
mankind
always
show
for
demonstrable
errors
over
undeniable
truths
the
number
of
persons
is
daily
increasing
who
have
begun
to
put
a
value
upon
mental
coherency
and
to
appreciate
the
charm
of
a
logical
position
it
was
common
talk
at
one
time
to
express
astonishment
at
the
extending
influence
of
the
church
of
rome
and
to
wonder
how
people
who
went
about
unaccompanied
by
keepers
could
submit
their
reason
to
the
papacy
with
her
open
rupture
with
science
and
her
evil
historical
reputation
from
astonishment
to
contempt

and
then
our

all
peter
chains
about
his

his
back
brave
with
the
needlework
of

believes
who
wonders
and
who
cares
it
used
to
be
thought
a
sufficient
explanation
to
say
either
that
the
man
was
an
ass
or
that
it
was
all
those
ritualists
but
gradually
it
became
apparent
that
the
pervert
was
not
always
an
ass
and
that
the
ritualists
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
if
a
man
tastes
run
in
the
direction
of
gothic
architecture
free
seats
daily
services
frequent
communions
lighted
candles
and
church
millinery
they
can
all
be
gratified
not
to
say

in
the
church
of
his
baptism
it
is
not
the
roman
ritual
however
splendid
nor
her
ceremonial
however
spiritually
significant
nor
her
system
of
doctrine
as
well
arranged
as
roman
law
and
as
subtle
as
greek
philosophy
that
makes
romanists
nowadays
it
is
when
a
person
of
religious
spirit
and
strong
convictions
as
to
the
truth
and
importance
of
certain
dogmas
few
in
number
it
may
be
perhaps
only
one
the
being
of
god
first
becomes
fully
alive
to
the
tendency
and
direction
of
the
most
active
opinions
of
the
day
when
his
alarm
quickening
his
insight
he
reads
as
it
were
between
the
lines
of
books
magazines
and
newspapers
when
struck
with
a
sudden
trepidation
he
asks
is
this
to
stop
how
can
i
to
the
extent
of
a
poor
ability
help
to
stem
this
tide
of
opinion
which
daily
increases
its
volume
and
floods
new
territory
then
it
is
that
the
church
of
rome
stretches
out
her
arms
and
seems
to
say
not
with
your
destiny
which
is
to
become
a
catholic
you
may
see
difficulties
and
you
may
have
doubts
they
abound
everywhere
you
will
never
get
rid
of
them
but
i
and
i
alone
have
never
coquetted
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
i
and
i
alone
have
never
submitted
my
creeds
to
be
overhauled
by
infidels
join
me
acknowledge
my
authority
and
you
need
dread
no
side
attack
and
fear
no
charge
of
inconsistency
succeed
finally
i
must
but
even
were
i
to
fail
yours
would
be
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
had
never
held
an
opinion
used
an
argument
or
said
a
word
that
could
fairly
have
served
the
purpose
of
your
triumphant
enemy
at
such
a
crisis
as
this
in
a
man
life
he
does
not
ask
himself
how
little
can
i
believe
with
how
few
miracles
can
i
get
off
he
demands
sound
armour
sharp
weapons
and
above
all
firm
ground
to
stand
on
a
good
footing
for
his
faith
and
these
he
is
apt
to
fancy
he
can
get
from
rome
alone
no
doubt
he
has
to
pay
for
them
but
the
charm
of
the
church
of
rome
is
this
when
you
have
paid
her
price
you
get
your
goods
a
neat
assortment
of
coherent
interdependent
logical
opinions
it
is
not
much
use
under
such
circumstances
to
call
the
convert
a
coward
and
facetiously
to
inquire
of
him
what
he
really
thinks
about
januarius
nobody
ever
began
with
januarius
i
have
no
doubt
a
good
many
romanists
would
be
glad
to
be
quit
of
him
he
is
part
of
the
price
they
have
to
pay
in
order
that
their
title
to
the
possession
of
other
miracles
may
be
quieted
if
you
can
convince
the
convert
that
he
can
disbelieve
januarius
of
naples
without
losing
his
grip
of
paul
of
tarsus
you
will
be
well
employed
but
if
you
begin
with
merry
gibes
and
end
with
contemptuously
demanding
that
he
should
have
done
with
such
nonsense
and
fling
the
rubbish
overboard
he
will
draw
in
his
horns
and
perhaps
if
he
knows
his
browning
murmur
to
himself
such
a
process
i
discern
no
end
cutting
off
one
excrescence
to
see
two
there
is
ever
a
next
in
size
now
grown
as
big
that
meets
the
knife
i
cut
and
cut
again
first
cut
the
liquefaction
what
comes
last
but
fichte
clever
cut
at
god
himself
to
suppose
that
no
person
is
logically
entitled
to
fear
god
and
to
ridicule
januarius
at
the
same
time
is
doubtless
extravagant
but
to
do
so
requires
care
there
is
an
in
thinking
we
must
consider
how
propositions
lie
towards
each
other
how
a
theory
hangs
together
and
what
will
follow
if
it
be
admitted
it
is
eminently
desirable
that
we
should
consider
the
logical
termini
of
our
opinions
travelling
up
to
town
last
month
from
the
west
a
gentleman
got
into
my
carriage
at
swindon
who
as
we
moved
off
and
began
to
rush
through
the
country
became
unable
to
restrain
his
delight
at
our
speed
his
face
shone
with
pride
as
if
he
were
pulling
us
himself
a
charming
train
he
exclaimed
is
the
pace
i
like
to
travel
at
i
indicated
assent
shortly
afterwards
when
our
windows
rattled
as
we
rushed
through
reading
he
let
one
of
them
down
in
a
hurry
and
cried
out
in
consternation
i
want
to
get
out
here
train
i
observed
the
pace
i
like
to
travel
at
but
it
awkward
if
you
want
to
go
anywhere
except
paddington
my
companion
made
no
reply
his
face
ceased
to
shine
and
as
he
sat
whizzing
past
his
dinner
i
mentally
compared
his
recent
exultation
with
that
of
those
who
in
the
present
day
extol
much
of
its
spirit
use
many
of
its
arguments
and
partake
in
most
of
its
triumphs
in
utter
ignorance
as
to
whitherwards
it
is
all
tending
as
surely
as
the
great
western
rails
run
into
paddington
victims
said
a
distinguished
divine
addressing
the
evangelicals
then
rejoicing
over
their
one
legal
victory
the
case
you
dream
that
the
spirit
of
the
age
is
working
for
you
or
are
you
secretly
prepared
to
go
further
than
you
avow
matthew
arnold
friends
the
nonconformists
are
as
a
rule
nowadays
bad
logicians
what
newman
has
said
of
the
tractarians
is
with
but
a
verbal
alteration
also
true
of
a
great
many
nonconformists
there
are
those
among
them
who
have
very
little
grasp
of
principle
even
from
the
natural
temper
of
their
minds
they
see
this
thing
is
beautiful
and
that
is
in
the
fathers
and
a
third
is
expedient
and
a
fourth
pious
but
of
their
connection
one
with
another
their
hidden
essence
and
their
life
and
the
bearing
of
external
matters
upon
each
and
upon
all
they
have
no
perception
or
even
suspicion
they
do
not
look
at
things
as
part
of
a
whole
and
often
will
sacrifice
the
most
important
and
precious
portions
of
their
creed
or
make
irremediable
concessions
in
word
or
in
deed
from
mere
simplicity
and
want
of
apprehension
we
have
heard
of
baptists
asked
to
become
and
actually
becoming
godfathers
and
godmothers
to
episcopalian
babies
what
terrible
confusion
is
here
a
point
is
thought
to
be
of
sufficient
importance
to
justify
separation
on
account
of
it
from
the
whole
christian
church
and
yet
not
to
be
of
importance
enough
to
debar
the
separatist
from
taking
part
in
a
ceremony
whose
sole
significance
is
that
it
gives
the
lie
direct
to
the
point
of
separation
but
we
all
of
us
churchmen
and
dissenters
alike
select
our
opinions
far
too
much
in
the
same
fashion
as
ladies
are
reported
i
dare
say
quite
falsely
to
do
their
afternoon
shopping
this
thing
because
it
is
so
pretty
and
that
thing
because
it
is
so
cheap
we
pick
and
choose
take
and
leave
approbate
and
reprobate
in
a
breath
a
familiar
anecdote
is
never
out
of
place
an
english
captain
anxious
to
conciliate
a
savage
king
sent
him
on
shore
for
his
own
royal
wear
an
entire
dress
suit
his
majesty
was
graciously
pleased
to
accept
the
gift
and
as
it
never
occurred
to
the
royal
mind
that
he
could
by
any
possibility
wear
all
the
things
himself
with
kingly
generosity
he
distributed
what
he
did
not
want
amongst
his
court
this
done
he
sent
for
the
donor
to
thank
him
in
person
as
the
captain
walked
up
the
beach
his
majesty
advanced
to
meet
him
looking
every
inch
a
king
in
the
sober
dignity
of
a
the
waistcoat
imparted
an
air
of
pensive
melancholy
that
mightily
became
the
prime
minister
whilst
the
lord
chamberlain
as
he
skipped
to
and
fro
in
his
white
gloves
looked
a
courtier
indeed
the
trousers
had
become
the
subject
of
an
unfortunate
dispute
in
the
course
of
which
they
had
sustained
such
injuries
as
to
be
hardly
recognisable
the
captain
was
convulsed
with
laughter
but
in
truth
the
mental
toilet
of
most
of
us
is
as
defective
and
almost
as
risible
as
was
that
of
this
savage
court
we
take
on
our
opinions
without
paying
heed
to
conclusions
and
the
result
is
absurd
better
be
without
any
opinions
at
all
a
naked
savage
is
not
necessarily
an
undignified
object
but
a
savage
in
a
and
nothing
else
is
and
must
ever
remain
a
mockery
and
a
show
there
is
a
great
relativity
about
a
in
the
language
of
the
logicians
the
name
of
each
article
not
only
denotes
that
particular
but
connotes
all
the
rest
hence
it
came
about
that
that
which
when
worn
in
its
entirety
is
so
dull
and
decorous
became
so
provocative
of
homeric
laughter
when
distributed
amongst
several
wearers
no
person
with
the
least
tincture
of
taste
can
ever
weary
of
newman
and
no
apology
is
therefore
offered
for
another
quotation
from
his
pages
in
his
story
and
gain
he
makes
one
of
his
characters
who
has
just
become
a
catholic
thus
refer
to
the
stock
anglican
divines
a
class
of
writers
who
are
at
all
events
immensely
superior
to
the
ellicotts
and
farrars
of
these
latter
days
am
embracing
that
creed
which
upholds
the
divinity
of
tradition
with
laud
consent
of
fathers
with
beveridge
a
visible
church
with
bramhall
dogma
with
bull
the
authority
of
the
pope
with
thorndyke
penance
with
taylor
prayers
for
the
dead
with
ussher
celibacy
asceticism
ecclesiastical
discipline
with
bingham
what
is
this
to
say
but
that
according
to
the
cardinal
our
great
english
divines
have
divided
the
roman
amongst
themselves
this
particular
charge
may
perhaps
be
untrue
but
with
that
i
am
not
concerned
if
it
is
not
true
of
them
it
is
true
of
somebody
else
is
satisfactory
so
far
as
lydgate
is
concerned
says
farebrother
in
with
an
air
of
precision
as
to
bulstrode
the
report
may
be
true
of
some
other
son
we
must
all
be
acquainted
with
the
reckless
way
in
which
people
pluck
opinions
like
flowers
a
bud
here
and
a
leaf
there
the
bouquet
is
pretty
but
you
must
look
for
it
in
the
oven
there
is
a
sense
in
which
it
is
quite
true
what
our
other
cardinal
has
said
about
ultramontanes
anglicans
and
orthodox
dissenters
all
being
in
the
same
boat
they
all
of
them
enthrone
opinion
holding
it
to
be
when
encased
in
certain
dogmas
truth
absolute
consequently
they
have
all
their
martyrologies
the
bright
of
those
who
have
defied
caesar
even
unto
death
or
at
all
events
gaol
they
all
therefore
put
something
above
the
state
and
apply
tests
other
than
those
recognised
in
our
law
courts
the
precise
way
by
which
they
come
at
their
opinions
is
only
detail
be
it
an
infallible
church
an
infallible
book
or
an
inward
spiritual
grace
the
outcome
is
the
same
the
romanist
of
course
has
to
bear
the
first
brunt
and
is
the
most
obnoxious
to
the
state
but
he
must
be
slow
of
comprehension
and
void
of
imagination
who
can
not
conceive
of
circumstances
arising
in
this
country
when
the
state
should
assert
it
to
be
its
duty
to
violate
what
even
protestants
believe
to
be
the
moral
law
of
god
therefore
in
opposing
ultramontanism
as
it
surely
ought
to
be
opposed
care
ought
to
be
taken
by
those
who
are
not
prepared
to
go
all
lengths
with
caesar
to
select
their
weapons
of
attack
not
from
his
armoury
but
from
their
own
how
ridiculous
it
is
to
see
some
estimable
man
who
subscribes
to
the
bible
society
and
takes
what
he
calls
warm
interest
in
the
heathen
chuckling
over
some
scoffing
article
in
a
newspaper
say
about
a
church
congress
and
never
perceiving
so
unaccustomed
is
he
to
examine
directions
that
he
is
all
the
time
laughing
at
his
own
folly
aunt
nesbit
in
considered
gibbon
a
very
pious
writer
am
sure
says
she
makes
the
most
religious
reflections
all
along
i
liked
him
particularly
on
that
account
this
poor
lady
had
some
excuse
a
vein
of
irony
like
gibbon
is
not
struck
upon
every
day
but
readers
of
newspapers
when
they
laugh
ought
to
be
able
to
perceive
what
it
is
they
are
laughing
at
logic
is
the
prime
necessity
of
the
hour
decomposition
and
transformation
is
going
on
all
around
us
but
far
too
slowly
some
opinions
bold
and
erect
as
they
may
still
stand
are
in
reality
but
empty
shells
one
shove
would
be
fatal
why
is
it
not
given
the
world
is
full
of
doleful
creatures
who
move
about
demanding
our
sympathy
i
have
nothing
to
offer
them
but
doses
of
logic
and
stern
commands
to
move
on
or
fall
back
catholics
in
distress
about
infallibility
protestants
devoting
themselves
to
the
dismal
task
of
paring
down
the
dimensions
of
this
miracle
and
reducing
the
credibility
of
that
one
as
if
any
appreciable
relief
from
the
burden
of
faith
could
be
so
obtained
sentimental
sceptics
who
after
labouring
to
demolish
what
they
call
the
chimera
of
superstition
fall
to
weeping
as
they
remember
they
have
now
no
lies
to
teach
their
children
democrats
who
are
frightened
at
the
rough
voice
of
the
people
and
aristocrats
flirting
with
democracy
logic
if
it
can
not
cure
might
at
least
silence
these
gentry
falstaff
there
is
more
material
for
a
life
of
falstaff
than
for
a
life
of
shakespeare
though
for
both
there
is
a
lamentable
dearth
the
difficulties
of
the
biographer
are
however
different
in
the
two
cases
there
is
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
in
shakespeare
works
which
throws
light
on
his
own
story
and
such
evidence
as
we
have
is
of
the
kind
called
circumstantial
but
falstaff
constantly
gives
us
reminiscences
or
allusions
to
his
earlier
life
and
his
companions
also
tell
us
stories
which
ought
to
help
us
in
a
biography
the
evidence
such
as
it
is
is
direct
and
the
only
inference
we
have
to
draw
is
that
from
the
statement
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
it
has
been
justly
remarked
by
sir
james
stephen
that
this
very
inference
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
one
of
all
to
draw
correctly
the
inference
from
circumstantial
evidence
if
you
have
enough
of
it
is
much
surer
for
whilst
facts
can
not
lie
witnesses
can
and
frequently
do
the
witnesses
on
whom
we
have
to
rely
for
the
facts
are
falstaff
and
his
companions
especially
falstaff
when
an
old
man
tries
to
tell
you
the
story
of
his
youth
he
sees
the
facts
through
a
distorting
subjective
medium
and
gives
an
impression
of
his
history
and
exploits
more
or
less
at
variance
with
the
bare
facts
as
seen
by
a
contemporary
outsider
the
scientific
goethe
though
truthful
enough
in
the
main
certainly
fails
in
his
reminiscences
to
tell
a
plain
unvarnished
tale
and
falstaff
was
habitually
truthful
indeed
that
western
american
who
wrote
affectionately
on
the
tomb
of
a
comrade
a
he
was
unrivalled
had
probably
not
given
sufficient
attention
to
falstaff
claims
in
this
matter
then
falstaff
companions
are
not
witnesses
above
suspicion
generally
speaking
they
lie
open
to
the
charge
made
by
against
the
wags
of
his
parish
that
they
were
men
delighting
more
in
their
own
conceits
than
in
the
truth
these
are
some
of
our
difficulties
and
we
ask
the
reader
indulgence
in
our
endeavours
to
overcome
them
we
will
tell
the
story
from
our
hero
birth
and
will
not
begin
longer
that
event
than
is
usual
with
biographers
the
question
was
falstaff
born
has
given
us
some
trouble
we
confess
to
having
once
entertained
a
strong
opinion
that
he
was
a
devonshire
man
this
opinion
was
based
simply
on
the
flow
and
fertility
of
his
wit
as
shown
in
his
conversation
and
the
rapid
and
fantastic
play
of
his
imagination
but
we
sought
in
vain
for
any
verbal
provincialisms
in
support
of
this
theory
and
there
was
something
in
the
character
of
the
man
that
rather
went
against
it
still
we
clung
to
the
opinion
till
we
found
that
philology
was
against
us
and
that
the
falstaffs
unquestionably
came
from
norfolk
the
name
is
of
scandinavian
origin
and
we
find
in
that
a
certain
falstaff
held
freely
from
the
king
a
church
at
stamford
these
facts
are
of
great
importance
the
thirst
for
which
falstaff
was
always
conspicuous
was
no
doubt
inherited
was
in
fact
a
scandinavian
thirst
the
pirates
of
early
english
times
drank
as
well
as
they
fought
and
their
descendants
who
invade
england
now
that
the
war
of
commerce
has
superseded
the
war
of
conquest
still
bring
the
old
thirst
with
them
as
anyone
can
testify
who
has
enjoyed
the
hospitality
of
the
london
scandinavian
club
then
this
church
was
no
doubt
a
familiar
landmark
in
the
family
and
when
falstaff
stated
late
in
life
that
if
he
forgotten
what
the
inside
of
a
church
was
like
he
was
a
peppercorn
and
a
brewer
horse
he
was
thinking
with
some
remorse
of
the
family
temple
of
the
family
between
the
conquest
and
falstaff
birth
we
know
nothing
except
that
according
to
falstaff
statement
he
had
a
grandfather
who
left
him
a
worth
forty
marks
from
this
statement
we
might
infer
that
the
ring
was
an
heirloom
and
consequently
that
falstaff
was
an
eldest
son
and
the
head
of
his
family
but
we
must
be
careful
in
drawing
our
inferences
for
prince
henry
frequently
told
falstaff
that
the
ring
was
copper
and
on
one
occasion
when
falstaff
alleged
that
his
pocket
had
been
picked
at
the
boar
head
and
this
and
three
or
four
bonds
of
forty
pounds
apiece
abstracted
the
prince
assessed
the
total
loss
at
after
giving
careful
attention
to
the
evidence
and
particularly
to
the
conduct
of
falstaff
on
the
occasion
of
the
alleged
robbery
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ring
copper
and
was
not
an
heirloom
this
leaves
us
without
any
information
about
falstaff
family
prior
to
his
birth
he
was
born
as
he
himself
informs
the
lord
chief
justice
about
three
in
the
afternoon
with
a
white
head
and
something
a
round
belly
falstaffs
corpulence
therefore
as
well
as
his
thirst
was
congenital
let
those
who
are
not
born
with
his
comfortable
figure
sigh
in
vain
to
attain
his
stately
proportions
this
is
a
thing
which
nature
gives
us
at
our
birth
as
much
as
the
scandinavian
thirst
or
the
shaping
spirit
of
imagination
born
somewhere
in
norfolk
falstaff
early
months
and
years
were
no
doubt
rich
with
the
promise
of
his
after
greatness
we
have
no
record
of
his
infancy
and
are
tempted
to
supply
the
gap
with
rabelais
chapters
on
gargantua
babyhood
but
regard
for
the
truth
compels
us
to
add
nothing
that
can
not
fairly
be
deduced
from
the
evidence
we
leave
the
strapping
boy
in
his
to
answer
the
question
he
was
born
now
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
falstaff
who
was
so
precise
about
the
hour
of
his
birth
should
not
have
mentioned
the
year
on
this
point
we
are
again
left
to
inference
from
conflicting
statements
we
have
this
distinct
point
to
start
from
that
falstaff
in
or
about
the
year
gives
his
age
as
some
fifty
or
lady
inclining
to
it
is
true
that
in
other
places
he
represents
himself
as
old
and
again
in
another
states
that
he
and
his
accomplices
in
the
gadshill
robbery
are
in
the
vaward
of
their
youth
the
chief
justice
reproves
him
for
this
affectation
of
youth
and
puts
a
question
which
it
is
true
elicits
no
admission
from
falstaff
as
to
whether
every
part
of
him
is
not
blasted
with
antiquity
we
are
inclined
to
think
that
falstaff
rather
understated
his
age
when
he
described
himself
as
lady
inclining
to
and
that
we
shall
not
be
far
wrong
if
we
set
down
as
the
year
of
his
birth
we
can
not
be
certain
to
a
year
or
two
there
is
a
similar
uncertainty
about
the
year
of
sir
richard
whittington
birth
but
both
these
great
men
whose
careers
afford
in
some
respects
striking
contrasts
were
born
within
a
few
years
of
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
falstaff
childhood
was
no
doubt
spent
in
norfolk
and
we
learn
from
his
own
lips
that
he
plucked
geese
played
truant
and
whipped
top
and
that
he
did
not
escape
beating
that
he
had
brothers
and
sisters
we
know
for
he
tells
us
that
he
is
with
them
and
with
all
europe
we
do
not
know
the
dame
or
pedant
who
taught
his
young
idea
how
to
shoot
and
formed
his
manners
but
falstaff
says
that
his
manners
became
him
not
he
was
a
fool
that
taught
them
him
this
does
not
throw
much
light
on
his
early
education
for
it
is
not
clear
that
the
remark
applies
to
that
period
and
in
any
case
it
is
purely
hypothetical
but
falstaff
like
so
many
boys
since
his
time
left
his
home
in
the
country
and
came
to
london
his
brothers
and
sisters
he
left
behind
him
and
we
hear
no
more
of
them
probably
none
of
them
ever
attained
eminence
as
there
is
no
record
of
falstaff
having
attempted
to
borrow
money
of
them
we
know
falstaff
so
well
as
a
tun
of
man
a
and
so
forth
that
it
is
not
easy
to
form
an
idea
of
what
he
was
in
his
youth
but
if
we
trace
back
the
current
of
his
life
to
the
day
when
full
of
wonder
and
hope
he
first
rode
into
london
we
shall
find
him
as
different
from
shakespeare
picture
of
him
as
the
thames
at
iffley
is
from
the
thames
at
london
bridge
his
figure
was
shapely
he
had
no
difficulty
in
seeing
his
own
knee
and
if
he
was
not
able
as
he
afterwards
asserted
to
creep
through
an
alderman
ring
nevertheless
he
had
all
the
grace
and
activity
of
youth
he
was
just
such
a
lad
to
take
a
description
almost
contemporary
as
the
squier
who
rode
with
the
canterbury
pilgrims
lover
and
a
lusty
bacheler
with
lockes
crull
as
they
were
laid
in
presse
of
twenty
yere
of
age
he
was
i
gesse
of
his
stature
he
was
of
even
lengthe
and
wonderly
deliver
and
grete
of
strengthe
embrouded
was
he
as
it
were
a
mede
all
ful
of
freshe
floures
white
and
rede
singing
he
was
or
floyting
alle
the
day
he
was
as
freshe
as
is
the
moneth
of
may
short
was
his
goune
with
sleves
long
and
wide
wel
coude
he
sitte
on
hors
and
fayre
ride
he
coude
songes
make
and
wel
endite
juste
and
eke
dance
and
wel
pourtraie
and
write
so
hot
he
loved
that
by
nightertale
he
slep
no
more
than
doth
the
nightingale
such
was
falstaff
at
the
age
of
twenty
or
something
earlier
when
he
entered
at
clement
inn
where
were
many
other
young
men
reading
law
and
preparing
for
their
call
to
the
bar
how
much
law
he
read
it
is
impossible
now
to
ascertain
that
he
had
in
later
life
a
considerable
knowledge
of
the
subject
is
clear
but
this
may
have
been
acquired
like
micawber
by
experience
as
defendant
on
civil
process
we
are
inclined
to
think
he
read
but
little
fures
temporis
and
he
had
many
friends
at
clement
inn
who
were
not
smugs
nor
indeed
reading
men
in
any
sense
there
was
john
doit
of
staffordshire
and
black
george
barnes
and
francis
pickbone
and
will
squele
a
cotswold
man
and
robert
shallow
from
gloucestershire
four
of
these
were
such
as
were
not
to
be
found
again
in
all
the
inns
o
court
and
we
have
it
on
the
authority
of
justice
shallow
that
falstaff
was
a
good
backswordsman
and
that
before
he
had
done
growing
he
broke
the
head
of
skogan
at
the
court
gate
this
skogan
appears
to
have
been
to
edward
iii
no
doubt
the
natural
rivalry
between
the
amateur
and
the
professional
caused
the
quarrel
and
skogan
must
have
been
a
good
man
if
he
escaped
with
a
broken
head
only
and
without
damage
to
his
reputation
as
a
professional
wit
the
same
day
that
falstaff
did
this
deed
of
daring
the
only
one
of
the
kind
recorded
of
him
shallow
fought
with
sampson
stockfish
a
fruiterer
behind
inn
shallow
was
a
gay
dog
in
his
youth
according
to
his
own
account
he
was
called
mad
shallow
lusty
shallow
indeed
he
was
called
anything
he
played
sir
dagonet
in
arthur
show
at
mile
end
green
and
no
doubt
falstaff
and
the
rest
of
the
set
were
cast
for
other
parts
in
the
same
pageant
these
tall
fellows
of
clement
inn
kept
well
together
for
they
liked
each
other
company
and
they
needed
each
other
help
in
a
row
in
turnbull
street
or
elsewhere
their
watchword
was
boys
and
they
made
the
old
strand
ring
with
their
songs
as
they
strolled
home
to
their
chambers
of
an
evening
they
heard
the
chimes
at
midnight
which
it
must
be
confessed
does
not
seem
to
us
a
desperately
dissipated
entertainment
but
midnight
was
a
late
hour
in
those
days
the
paralytic
masher
of
the
present
day
who
is
most
alive
at
midnight
rises
at
noon
the
day
began
earlier
with
a
long
morning
followed
by
a
pleasant
period
called
the
forenoon
under
modern
conditions
we
spend
the
morning
in
bed
and
to
palliate
our
sloth
call
the
forenoon
and
most
of
the
rest
of
the
day
the
morning
these
young
men
of
clement
inn
were
a
lively
not
to
say
a
rowdy
set
they
would
do
anything
that
led
to
mirth
or
mischief
what
passed
when
they
lay
all
night
in
the
windmill
in
george
field
we
do
not
quite
know
but
we
are
safe
in
assuming
that
they
did
not
go
there
to
pursue
their
legal
duties
or
to
grind
corn
anyhow
forty
years
after
that
night
raised
pleasant
memories
john
falstaff
was
the
life
and
centre
of
this
set
as
robert
shallow
was
the
butt
of
it
the
latter
had
few
personal
attractions
according
to
falstaff
portrait
of
him
he
looked
like
a
man
made
after
supper
of
a
when
he
was
naked
he
was
for
all
the
world
like
a
forked
radish
with
a
head
fantastically
carved
upon
it
with
a
knife
he
was
so
forlorn
that
his
dimensions
to
any
thick
sight
were
invincible
he
was
the
very
genius
of
famine
and
a
certain
section
of
his
friends
called
him
mandrake
he
came
ever
in
the
rearward
of
the
fashion
and
sung
those
tunes
to
the
huswives
that
he
heard
the
carmen
whistle
and
sware
they
were
his
fancies
or
his
then
he
had
the
honour
of
having
his
head
burst
by
john
o
gaunt
for
crowding
among
the
marshal
men
in
the
and
this
was
matter
for
continual
gibe
from
falstaff
and
the
other
boys
falstaff
was
in
the
van
of
the
fashion
was
witty
himself
without
being
at
that
time
the
cause
that
wit
was
in
others
no
one
could
come
within
range
of
his
wit
without
being
attracted
and
overpowered
late
in
life
falstaff
deplores
nothing
so
much
in
the
character
of
prince
john
of
lancaster
as
this
that
a
man
can
not
make
him
laugh
he
felt
this
defect
in
the
prince
character
keenly
for
laughter
was
falstaff
familiar
spirit
which
never
failed
to
come
at
his
call
it
was
by
laughter
that
young
falstaff
fascinated
his
friends
and
ruled
over
them
there
are
only
left
to
us
a
few
scraps
of
his
conversation
and
these
have
been
and
will
be
to
all
time
the
delight
of
all
good
men
the
clement
inn
boys
who
enjoyed
the
feast
of
which
we
have
but
the
crumbs
left
to
us
were
happy
almost
beyond
the
lot
of
man
for
there
is
more
in
laughter
than
is
allowed
by
the
austere
or
generally
recognised
by
the
jovial
by
laughter
man
is
distinguished
from
the
beasts
but
the
cares
and
sorrows
of
life
have
all
but
deprived
man
of
this
distinguishing
grace
and
degraded
him
to
a
brutal
solemnity
then
comes
alas
how
rarely
a
genius
such
as
falstaff
which
restores
the
power
of
laughter
and
transforms
the
stolid
brute
into
man
this
genius
approaches
nearly
to
the
divine
power
of
creation
and
we
may
truly
say
for
less
were
deified
it
is
no
marvel
that
young
falstaff
friends
assiduously
served
the
deity
who
gave
them
this
good
gift
at
first
he
was
satisfied
with
the
mere
exercise
of
his
genial
power
but
he
afterwards
made
it
serviceable
to
him
it
was
but
just
that
he
should
receive
tribute
from
those
who
were
beholden
to
him
for
a
pleasure
which
no
other
could
confer
it
was
now
that
falstaff
began
to
recognise
what
a
precious
gift
was
his
congenital
scandinavian
thirst
and
to
lose
no
opportunity
of
gratifying
it
we
have
his
mature
views
on
education
and
we
may
take
them
as
an
example
of
the
general
truth
that
old
men
habitually
advise
a
young
one
to
shape
the
conduct
of
his
life
after
their
own
rightly
to
apprehend
the
virtues
of
is
the
first
qualification
in
an
instructor
of
youth
i
had
a
thousand
sons
says
he
first
humane
principles
i
would
teach
them
should
be
to
forswear
thin
potations
and
to
addict
themselves
to
sack
and
further
never
none
of
these
demure
boys
come
to
any
proof
for
their
drink
doth
so
their
blood
and
making
many
that
they
fall
into
a
kind
of
male
green
sickness
and
then
when
they
marry
they
get
wenches
they
are
generally
fools
and
cowards
which
some
of
us
should
be
too
but
for
inflammation
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
falstaff
did
not
in
early
life
his
blood
but
addicted
himself
to
sack
and
gave
the
subject
a
great
part
of
his
attention
for
all
the
remainder
of
his
days
it
may
be
that
he
found
the
subject
too
absorbing
to
allow
of
his
giving
much
attention
to
old
father
antic
the
law
at
any
rate
he
was
never
called
to
the
bar
and
posterity
can
not
be
too
thankful
that
his
great
mind
was
not
lost
in
abyss
of
legal
eminence
which
has
received
so
many
men
who
might
have
adorned
their
country
that
he
was
fitted
for
a
brilliant
legal
career
can
admit
of
no
doubt
his
power
of
detecting
analogies
in
cases
apparently
different
his
triumphant
handling
of
cases
apparently
hopeless
his
wonderful
readiness
in
reply
and
his
dramatic
instinct
would
have
made
him
a
powerful
advocate
it
may
have
been
owing
to
difficulties
with
the
benchers
of
the
period
over
questions
of
discipline
or
it
may
have
been
a
distaste
for
the
profession
itself
which
induced
him
to
throw
up
the
law
and
adopt
the
profession
of
arms
we
know
that
while
he
was
still
at
clement
inn
he
was
page
to
lord
thomas
mowbray
who
was
afterwards
created
earl
of
nottingham
and
duke
of
norfolk
it
must
be
admitted
that
here
as
elsewhere
in
shakespeare
there
is
some
little
chronological
difficulty
we
will
not
inquire
too
curiously
but
simply
accept
the
testimony
of
justice
shallow
on
the
point
mowbray
was
an
able
and
ambitious
lord
and
falstaff
as
page
to
him
began
his
military
career
with
every
advantage
the
french
wars
of
the
later
years
of
edward
iii
gave
frequent
and
abundant
opportunity
for
distinction
mowbray
distinguished
himself
in
court
and
in
camp
and
we
should
like
to
believe
that
falstaff
was
in
the
when
mowbray
defeated
the
french
fleet
and
captured
vast
quantities
of
sack
from
the
enemy
unfortunately
there
is
no
record
whatever
of
early
military
career
and
beyond
his
own
ejaculation
to
god
that
my
name
was
not
so
terrible
to
the
enemy
as
it
is
and
the
possible
inference
from
it
that
he
must
have
made
his
name
terrible
in
some
way
we
have
no
evidence
that
he
was
ever
in
the
field
before
the
battle
of
shrewsbury
indeed
the
absence
of
evidence
on
this
matter
goes
strongly
to
prove
the
negative
falstaff
boasts
of
his
valour
his
alacrity
and
other
qualities
which
were
not
apparent
to
the
casual
observer
but
he
never
boasts
of
his
services
in
battle
if
there
had
been
anything
of
the
kind
to
which
he
could
refer
with
complacency
there
is
no
moral
doubt
that
he
would
have
mentioned
it
freely
adding
such
embellishments
and
circumstances
as
he
well
knew
how
in
the
absence
of
evidence
as
to
the
course
of
his
life
we
are
left
to
conjecture
how
he
spent
the
forty
years
more
or
less
between
the
time
of
his
studies
at
clement
inn
and
the
day
when
shakespeare
introduces
him
to
us
we
have
no
doubt
that
he
spent
all
or
nearly
all
this
time
in
london
his
habits
were
such
as
are
formed
by
life
in
a
great
city
his
conversation
betrays
a
man
who
has
lived
as
it
were
in
a
crowd
and
the
busy
haunts
of
men
were
the
appropriate
scene
for
the
display
of
his
great
qualities
london
even
then
was
a
great
city
and
the
study
of
it
might
well
absorb
a
lifetime
falstaff
knew
it
well
from
the
court
with
which
he
always
preserved
a
connection
to
the
numerous
taverns
where
he
met
his
friends
and
eluded
his
creditors
the
head
in
eastcheap
was
his
headquarters
and
like
barnabee
two
centuries
later
his
journeys
were
from
tavern
to
tavern
and
like
barnabee
he
might
say
bibi
nunquam
to
begin
with
no
doubt
the
dinner
bore
a
fair
proportion
to
the
fluid
which
accompanied
it
but
by
degrees
the
liquor
encroached
on
and
superseded
the
viands
until
his
tavern
bills
took
the
shape
of
the
one
purloined
by
prince
henry
in
which
there
was
but
one
of
bread
to
an
intolerable
deal
of
sack
it
was
this
inordinate
consumption
of
sack
and
not
sighing
and
grief
as
he
suggests
which
blew
him
up
like
a
bladder
a
life
of
leisure
in
london
always
had
and
still
has
its
temptations
falstaff
means
were
described
by
the
chief
justice
of
henry
iv
as
very
slender
but
this
was
after
they
had
been
wasted
for
years
originally
they
were
more
ample
and
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
living
at
ease
with
his
friends
no
domestic
cares
disturbed
the
even
tenor
of
his
life
bardolph
says
he
was
better
accommodated
than
with
a
wife
like
many
another
man
about
town
he
thought
about
settling
down
when
he
was
getting
up
in
years
he
weekly
swore
so
he
tells
us
to
marry
old
mistress
ursula
but
this
was
only
after
he
saw
the
first
white
hair
on
his
chin
but
he
never
led
mistress
ursula
to
the
altar
the
only
other
women
for
whom
he
formed
an
early
attachment
were
mistress
quickly
the
hostess
of
the
boar
head
and
doll
tearsheet
who
is
described
by
the
page
as
a
proper
gentlewoman
and
a
kinswoman
of
his
master
there
is
no
denying
that
falstaff
was
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
mistress
quickly
but
he
never
admitted
that
he
made
her
an
offer
of
marriage
she
however
asserted
it
in
the
strongest
terms
and
with
a
wealth
of
circumstance
we
must
transcribe
her
story
didst
swear
to
me
upon
a
goblet
sitting
in
my
at
the
round
table
by
a
fire
upon
wednesday
in
when
the
prince
broke
thy
head
for
liking
his
father
to
a
of
windsor
thou
didst
swear
to
me
then
as
i
was
washing
thy
wound
to
marry
me
and
make
me
my
lady
thy
wife
canst
thou
deny
it
did
not
goodwife
keech
the
butcher
wife
come
in
then
and
call
me
gossip
quickly
coming
in
to
borrow
a
mess
of
vinegar
telling
us
she
had
a
good
dish
of
prawns
whereby
thou
didst
desire
to
eat
some
whereby
i
told
thee
they
were
ill
for
a
green
wound
and
didst
thou
not
when
she
was
gone
downstairs
desire
me
to
be
no
more
so
familiarity
with
such
poor
people
saying
that
ere
long
they
should
call
me
madam
and
didst
thou
not
kiss
me
and
bid
me
fetch
thee
thirty
shillings
i
put
thee
now
to
thy
deny
it
if
thou
canst
we
feel
no
doubt
that
if
mistress
quickly
had
given
this
evidence
in
action
for
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
and
goodwife
keech
corroborated
it
the
jury
would
have
found
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff
unless
indeed
they
brought
in
a
special
verdict
to
the
effect
that
falstaff
made
the
promise
but
never
intended
to
keep
it
but
mistress
quickly
contented
herself
with
upbraiding
falstaff
and
he
cajoled
her
with
his
usual
skill
and
borrowed
more
money
of
her
falstaff
attachment
for
doll
tearsheet
lasted
many
years
but
did
not
lead
to
matrimony
from
the
clement
inn
days
till
he
was
threescore
he
lived
in
london
celibate
and
his
habits
and
amusements
were
much
like
those
of
other
single
gentlemen
about
town
of
his
time
or
for
that
matter
of
ours
he
had
only
himself
to
care
for
and
he
cared
for
himself
well
like
his
page
he
had
a
good
angel
about
him
but
the
devil
outbid
him
he
was
as
virtuously
given
as
other
folk
but
perhaps
the
devil
had
a
handle
for
temptation
in
that
congenital
thirst
of
his
he
was
a
social
spirit
too
and
he
tells
us
that
company
villainous
company
was
the
spoil
of
him
he
was
less
than
thirty
when
he
took
the
faithful
bardolph
into
his
service
and
only
just
past
that
age
when
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
nimble
poins
before
he
was
forty
he
became
the
constant
guest
of
mistress
quickly
pistol
and
nym
were
later
acquisitions
and
the
prince
did
not
come
upon
the
scene
till
falstaff
was
an
old
man
and
knighted
there
is
some
doubt
as
to
when
he
obtained
this
honour
richard
ii
bestowed
titles
in
so
lavish
a
manner
as
to
cause
discontent
among
many
who
did
receive
them
in
immediately
on
his
accession
the
earldom
of
nottingham
was
given
to
thomas
mowbray
and
on
the
same
day
three
other
earls
and
nine
knights
were
created
we
have
not
been
able
to
discover
the
names
of
these
knights
but
we
confidently
expect
to
unearth
them
some
day
and
to
find
the
name
of
sir
john
falstaff
among
them
we
have
already
stated
that
falstaff
had
done
no
service
in
the
field
at
this
time
so
he
could
not
have
earned
his
title
in
that
manner
no
doubt
he
got
it
through
the
influence
of
mowbray
who
was
in
a
position
to
get
good
things
for
his
friends
as
well
as
for
himself
it
was
but
a
poor
acknowledgment
for
the
inestimable
benefit
of
occasionally
talking
with
falstaff
over
a
quart
of
sack
we
will
not
pursue
falstaff
life
further
than
this
it
can
from
this
point
be
easily
collected
it
is
a
thankless
task
to
paraphrase
a
great
and
familiar
text
to
attempt
to
tell
the
story
in
better
words
than
shakespeare
would
occur
to
no
one
but
miss
braddon
who
has
epitomised
sir
walter
or
to
canon
farrar
who
has
elongated
the
gospels
but
we
feel
bound
to
add
a
few
words
as
to
character
there
are
we
fear
a
number
of
people
who
regard
falstaff
as
a
worthless
fellow
and
who
would
refrain
if
they
could
from
laughing
at
his
jests
these
people
do
not
understand
his
claim
to
grateful
and
affectionate
regard
he
did
more
to
produce
that
mental
condition
of
which
laughter
is
the
expression
than
any
man
who
ever
lived
but
for
the
cheering
presence
of
him
and
men
like
him
this
vale
of
tears
would
be
a
more
terrible
than
it
is
in
short
falstaff
has
done
an
immense
deal
to
alleviate
misery
and
promote
positive
happiness
what
more
can
be
said
of
your
heroes
and
philanthropists
it
is
perhaps
characteristic
of
this
commercial
age
that
benevolence
should
be
always
associated
if
not
considered
synonymous
with
the
giving
of
money
but
this
is
clearly
mistaken
for
we
have
to
consider
what
effect
the
money
given
produces
on
the
minds
and
bodies
of
human
beings
sir
richard
whittington
was
an
eminently
benevolent
man
and
spent
his
money
freely
for
the
good
of
his
we
sincerely
hope
by
the
way
that
he
lent
some
of
it
to
falstaff
without
security
he
endowed
hospitals
and
other
charities
hundreds
were
relieved
by
his
gifts
and
thousands
perhaps
are
now
in
receipt
of
his
alms
this
is
well
let
the
sick
and
the
poor
who
enjoy
his
hospitality
and
receive
his
doles
bless
his
memory
but
how
much
wider
and
is
the
influence
of
falstaff
those
who
enjoy
his
good
things
are
not
only
the
poor
and
the
sick
but
all
who
speak
the
english
language
nay
more
translation
has
made
him
the
inheritance
of
the
world
and
the
benefactor
of
the
entire
human
race
it
may
be
however
that
some
other
nations
fail
fully
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
mirth
and
the
character
of
the
man
a
gervinus
of
heidelberg
has
written
in
the
german
language
a
heavy
work
on
shakespeare
in
which
he
attacks
falstaff
in
a
very
solemn
and
determined
manner
and
particularly
charges
him
with
selfishness
and
want
of
conscience
we
are
inclined
to
set
down
this
malignant
attack
to
envy
falstaff
is
the
author
and
cause
of
universal
laughter
gervinus
will
never
be
the
cause
of
anything
universal
but
so
far
as
his
influence
extends
he
produces
headaches
it
is
probably
a
painful
sense
of
this
contrast
that
goads
on
the
author
of
headaches
to
attack
the
author
of
laughter
but
is
there
anything
in
the
charge
we
do
not
claim
anything
like
perfection
or
even
saintliness
for
falstaff
but
we
may
say
of
him
as
byron
says
of
venice
that
his
very
vices
are
of
the
gentler
sort
and
as
for
this
charge
of
selfishness
and
want
of
conscience
we
think
that
the
words
of
bardolph
on
his
master
death
are
an
overwhelming
answer
to
it
bardolph
said
on
hearing
the
news
would
i
were
with
him
wheresoever
he
is
whether
he
be
in
heaven
or
hell
bardolph
was
a
mere
not
of
the
highest
sensibility
and
he
for
thirty
years
knew
his
master
as
his
valet
knows
the
hero
surely
the
man
who
could
draw
such
an
expression
of
feeling
from
his
rough
servant
is
not
the
man
to
be
lightly
charged
with
selfishness
which
of
us
can
hope
for
such
an
epitaph
not
from
a
hireling
but
from
our
nearest
and
dearest
does
gervinus
know
anyone
who
will
make
such
a
reply
to
a
posthumous
charge
against
him
of
dulness
and
lack
of
humour
