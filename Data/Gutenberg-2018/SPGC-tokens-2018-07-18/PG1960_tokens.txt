sight
unseen
by
mary
roberts
rinehart
i
the
rather
extraordinary
story
revealed
by
the
experiments
of
the
neighborhood
club
have
been
until
now
a
matter
only
of
private
record
but
it
seems
to
me
as
an
active
participant
in
the
investigations
that
they
should
be
given
to
the
public
not
so
much
for
what
they
will
add
to
the
existing
data
on
psychical
research
for
from
that
angle
they
were
not
unusual
but
as
yet
another
exploration
into
that
still
uncharted
territory
the
human
mind
the
have
taught
us
something
about
the
individual
mind
they
have
their
own
patter
of
complexes
and
primal
instincts
of
the
unconscious
which
is
a
sort
of
bonded
warehouse
from
which
we
clandestinely
withdraw
our
stored
thoughts
and
impressions
they
lay
to
this
unconscious
mind
of
ours
all
phenomena
that
can
not
otherwise
be
labeled
and
ascribe
such
demonstrations
of
power
as
can
not
thus
be
explained
to
trickery
to
black
silk
threads
and
folding
rods
to
slates
with
false
sides
and
a
medium
with
chalk
on
his
finger
nail
in
other
words
they
give
us
subjective
mind
but
never
objective
mind
they
take
the
mind
and
its
reactions
on
itself
and
on
the
body
but
what
about
objective
mind
does
it
make
its
only
outward
manifestations
through
speech
and
action
can
we
ignore
the
effect
of
mind
on
mind
when
there
are
present
none
of
the
ordinary
media
of
communication
i
think
not
in
making
the
following
statement
concerning
our
part
in
the
strange
case
of
arthur
wells
a
certain
allowance
must
be
made
for
our
ignorance
of
psychic
phenomena
and
also
for
the
fact
that
since
that
time
just
before
the
war
great
advances
have
been
made
in
scientific
methods
of
investigation
for
instance
we
did
not
place
miss
jeremy
s
chair
on
a
scale
to
measure
for
any
loss
of
weight
also
the
theory
of
rods
of
invisible
matter
emanating
from
the
medium
s
body
to
move
bodies
at
a
distance
from
her
had
only
been
evolved
and
none
of
the
methods
for
calculation
of
leverages
and
strains
had
been
formulated
so
far
as
i
know
to
be
frank
i
am
quite
convinced
that
even
had
we
known
of
these
explanations
which
in
reality
explain
nothing
we
would
have
ignored
them
as
we
became
involved
in
the
dramatic
movement
of
the
revelations
and
the
personal
experiences
which
grew
out
of
them
i
confess
that
following
the
night
after
the
first
seance
any
observations
of
mine
would
have
been
of
no
scientific
value
whatever
and
i
believe
i
can
speak
for
the
others
also
of
the
medium
herself
i
can
only
say
that
we
have
never
questioned
her
integrity
the
physical
phenomena
occurred
before
she
went
into
trance
and
during
that
time
her
forearms
were
rigid
during
the
deep
trance
with
which
this
unusual
record
deals
she
spoke
in
her
own
voice
but
in
a
querulous
tone
and
sperry
s
examination
of
her
pulse
showed
that
it
went
from
eighty
normal
to
a
hundred
and
twenty
and
very
feeble
with
this
preface
i
come
to
the
death
of
arthur
wells
our
acquaintance
and
neighbor
and
the
investigation
into
that
death
by
a
group
of
six
earnest
people
who
call
themselves
the
neighborhood
club
the
neighborhood
club
was
organized
in
my
house
it
was
too
small
really
to
be
called
a
club
but
women
have
a
way
these
days
of
conferring
a
titular
dignity
on
their
activities
and
it
is
not
so
bad
after
all
the
neighborhood
club
it
really
was
composed
of
four
of
our
neighbors
my
wife
and
myself
we
had
drifted
into
the
habit
of
dining
together
on
monday
evenings
at
the
different
houses
there
were
herbert
robinson
and
his
sister
alice
not
a
young
woman
but
clever
alert
and
very
alive
sperry
the
heart
specialist
a
bachelor
still
in
spite
of
much
feminine
activity
and
there
was
old
dane
hopelessly
crippled
as
to
the
knees
with
rheumatism
but
one
of
those
glowing
and
kindly
souls
that
have
a
way
of
being
a
neighborhood
nucleus
it
was
around
her
that
we
first
gathered
with
an
idea
of
forming
for
her
certain
contact
points
with
the
active
life
from
which
she
was
otherwise
cut
off
but
she
gave
us
i
am
sure
more
than
we
brought
her
and
as
will
be
seen
later
her
shrewdness
was
an
important
element
in
solving
our
mystery
in
addition
to
these
four
there
were
my
wife
and
myself
it
had
been
our
policy
to
take
up
different
subjects
for
these
neighborhood
dinners
sperry
was
a
reformer
in
his
way
and
on
his
nights
we
generally
took
up
civic
questions
he
was
particularly
interested
in
the
responsibility
of
the
state
to
the
sick
poor
my
wife
and
i
had
political
evenings
not
really
politics
except
in
their
relation
to
life
i
am
a
lawyer
by
profession
and
dabble
a
bit
in
city
government
the
robinsons
had
literature
don
t
misunderstand
me
we
had
no
papers
no
set
programs
on
the
robinson
evenings
we
discussed
editorials
and
current
periodicals
as
well
as
the
new
books
and
plays
we
were
frequently
acrimonious
i
fear
but
our
small
wrangles
ended
with
the
evening
robinson
was
the
literary
editor
of
a
paper
and
his
sister
read
for
a
large
publishing
house
dane
was
a
give
me
that
privilege
she
begged
at
least
until
you
find
my
evenings
dull
it
gives
me
during
all
the
week
before
you
come
a
sort
of
thrilling
feeling
that
the
world
is
mine
to
choose
the
result
was
never
dull
she
led
us
all
the
way
from
to
modern
dress
she
led
us
even
further
as
you
will
see
on
consulting
my
i
find
that
the
first
evening
which
directly
concerns
the
arthur
wells
case
was
monday
november
the
second
of
last
year
it
was
a
curious
day
to
begin
with
there
come
days
now
and
then
that
bring
with
them
a
strange
sort
of
mental
excitement
i
have
never
analyzed
them
with
me
on
this
occasion
it
took
the
form
of
nervous
irritability
and
something
of
apprehension
my
wife
i
remember
complained
of
headache
and
one
of
the
stenographers
had
a
fainting
attack
i
have
often
wondered
for
how
much
of
what
happened
to
arthur
wells
the
day
was
responsible
there
are
days
when
the
world
is
a
place
for
love
and
play
and
laughter
and
then
there
are
sinister
days
when
the
earth
is
a
hideous
place
when
even
the
thought
of
immortality
is
unbearable
and
life
itself
a
burden
when
all
that
is
riotous
and
unlawful
comes
forth
and
bares
itself
to
the
light
this
was
such
a
day
i
am
fond
of
my
friends
but
i
found
no
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
meeting
them
that
evening
i
remembered
the
odious
squeak
in
the
wheels
of
dane
s
chair
i
resented
the
way
sperry
would
clear
his
throat
i
read
in
the
morning
paper
herbert
robinson
s
review
of
a
book
i
had
liked
and
disagreed
with
him
disagreed
violently
i
wanted
to
call
him
on
the
telephone
and
tell
him
that
he
was
a
fool
i
felt
old
although
i
am
only
old
and
bitter
and
tired
with
the
fall
of
twilight
things
changed
somewhat
i
was
more
passive
wretchedness
encompassed
me
but
i
was
not
wretched
there
was
violence
in
the
air
but
i
was
not
violent
and
with
a
bath
and
my
dinner
clothes
i
put
away
the
horrors
of
the
day
my
wife
was
better
but
the
cook
had
given
notice
there
has
been
quarreling
among
the
servants
all
day
my
wife
said
i
wish
i
could
go
and
live
on
a
desert
we
have
no
children
and
my
wife
for
lack
of
other
interests
finds
her
housekeeping
an
engrossing
and
serious
matter
she
is
in
the
habit
of
bringing
her
domestic
difficulties
to
me
when
i
reach
home
in
the
evenings
a
habit
which
sometimes
renders
me
unjustly
indignant
most
unjustly
for
she
has
borne
with
me
for
thirty
years
and
is
known
throughout
the
entire
neighborhood
as
a
perfect
housekeeper
i
can
close
my
eyes
and
find
any
desired
article
in
my
bedroom
at
any
time
we
passed
the
wellses
house
on
our
way
to
dane
s
that
night
and
my
wife
commented
on
the
dark
condition
of
the
lower
floor
even
if
they
are
going
out
she
said
it
would
add
to
the
appearance
of
the
street
to
leave
a
light
or
two
burning
but
some
people
have
no
public
i
made
no
comment
i
believe
the
wellses
were
a
young
couple
with
children
and
had
been
known
to
observe
that
they
considered
the
neighborhood
and
we
had
retaliated
i
regret
to
say
in
kind
but
not
with
any
real
unkindness
by
regarding
them
as
interlopers
they
drove
too
many
cars
and
drove
them
too
fast
they
kept
a
governess
and
didn
t
see
enough
of
their
children
and
their
english
butler
made
our
neat
maids
look
commonplace
there
is
generally
in
every
old
neighborhood
some
one
house
on
which
is
fixed
so
to
speak
the
community
gaze
and
in
our
case
it
was
on
the
arthur
wellses
it
was
a
curious
not
unfriendly
staring
much
i
daresay
like
that
of
the
old
robin
who
sees
two
young
wild
canaries
building
near
her
we
passed
the
house
and
went
on
to
dane
s
she
had
given
us
no
inkling
of
what
we
were
to
have
that
night
and
my
wife
conjectured
a
conjurer
she
gave
me
rather
a
triumphant
smile
when
we
were
received
in
the
library
and
the
doors
into
the
were
seen
to
be
tightly
closed
we
were
early
as
my
wife
is
a
punctual
person
and
soon
after
our
arrival
sperry
came
dane
was
in
her
chair
as
usual
with
her
companion
in
attendance
and
when
she
heard
sperry
s
voice
outside
she
excused
herself
and
was
wheeled
out
to
him
and
together
we
heard
them
go
into
the
when
the
robinsons
arrived
she
and
sperry
reappeared
and
we
waited
for
her
customary
announcement
of
the
evening
s
program
when
none
came
even
during
the
meal
i
confess
that
my
curiosity
was
almost
painful
i
think
looking
back
that
it
was
sperry
who
turned
the
talk
to
the
supernatural
and
that
to
the
accompaniment
of
considerable
gibing
by
the
men
he
told
a
ghost
story
that
set
the
women
to
looking
back
over
their
shoulders
into
the
dark
corners
beyond
the
zone
of
all
of
us
i
remember
except
sperry
and
dane
were
skeptical
as
to
the
supernatural
and
herbert
robinson
believed
that
while
there
were
sensitives
who
actually
went
into
trance
the
controls
which
took
possession
of
them
were
buried
personalities
of
their
own
released
during
trance
from
the
mind
if
not
he
said
truculently
if
they
are
really
spirits
why
can
t
they
tell
us
what
is
going
on
not
in
some
vague
place
where
they
are
always
happy
but
here
and
now
in
the
next
house
i
don
t
ask
for
prophecy
but
for
some
evidence
of
their
knowledge
are
the
germans
getting
ready
to
fight
england
is
horace
here
the
gay
dog
some
of
us
suspect
as
i
am
the
horace
in
question
i
must
explain
that
herbert
was
merely
being
facetious
my
life
is
a
most
orderly
and
decorous
one
but
my
wife
unfortunately
lacks
a
sense
of
humor
and
i
felt
that
the
remark
might
have
been
more
fortunate
physical
phenomena
scoffed
the
cynic
i
ve
seen
it
all
objects
moving
without
visible
hands
unexplained
currents
of
cold
air
voice
through
a
trumpet
i
know
the
whole
rotten
mess
and
i
ve
got
a
book
which
tells
how
to
do
all
the
tricks
i
ll
bring
it
along
some
dane
smiled
and
the
discussion
was
dropped
for
a
time
it
was
during
the
coffee
and
cigars
that
dane
made
her
announcement
as
alice
robinson
takes
an
cigarette
a
custom
my
wife
greatly
deplores
the
ladies
had
remained
with
us
at
the
table
as
a
matter
of
fact
herbert
she
said
we
intend
to
put
your
skepticism
to
the
test
tonight
doctor
sperry
has
found
a
medium
for
us
a
and
a
patient
of
his
and
she
has
kindly
consented
to
give
us
a
herbert
wheeled
and
looked
at
sperry
hold
up
your
right
hand
and
state
by
your
honor
as
a
member
in
good
standing
that
you
have
not
primed
her
sperry
held
up
his
hand
absolutely
not
he
said
gravely
she
is
coming
in
my
car
she
doesn
t
know
to
what
house
or
whose
she
knows
none
of
you
she
is
a
stranger
to
the
city
and
she
will
not
even
recognize
the
ii
the
butler
wheeled
out
dane
s
chair
as
her
companion
did
not
dine
with
her
on
club
nights
and
led
us
to
the
doors
there
sperry
threw
them
open
and
we
saw
that
the
room
had
been
completely
metamorphosed
dane
s
is
generally
rather
painful
kindly
soul
that
she
is
she
has
considered
it
necessary
to
preserve
and
exhibit
there
the
many
gifts
of
a
long
lifetime
photographs
long
outgrown
onyx
tables
a
clutter
of
odd
chairs
and
groups
of
discordant
usually
make
the
progress
of
her
chair
through
it
a
precarious
and
perilous
matter
we
paused
in
the
doorway
startled
the
room
had
been
dismantled
it
opened
before
us
walls
and
bare
rugs
gone
from
the
floor
even
curtains
taken
from
the
windows
to
emphasize
the
change
in
the
center
stood
a
common
pine
table
surrounded
by
seven
plain
chairs
all
the
lights
were
out
save
one
a
corner
bracket
which
was
screened
with
a
shade
she
watched
our
faces
with
keen
satisfaction
such
a
time
i
had
doing
it
she
said
the
servants
of
course
think
i
have
gone
mad
all
except
clara
i
told
her
she
s
a
sensible
herbert
chuckled
very
neat
he
said
although
a
chair
or
two
for
the
spooks
would
have
been
no
more
than
hospitable
all
right
now
bring
on
your
my
wife
however
looked
slightly
displeased
as
a
she
said
i
really
feel
that
it
is
positively
impious
to
bring
back
the
souls
of
the
departed
before
they
are
called
from
on
oh
rats
herbert
broke
in
rudely
they
ll
not
come
don
t
worry
and
if
you
hear
raps
don
t
worry
it
will
probably
be
the
medium
cracking
the
joint
of
her
big
there
was
still
a
half
hour
until
the
medium
s
arrival
at
dane
s
direction
we
employed
it
in
searching
the
room
it
was
the
ordinary
rectangular
occupying
a
corner
of
the
house
two
windows
at
the
end
faced
on
the
street
with
a
patch
of
lawn
beneath
them
a
with
a
dying
fire
and
flanked
by
two
other
windows
occupied
the
long
side
opposite
the
door
into
the
hall
these
windows
opening
on
a
garden
were
closed
by
outside
shutters
now
bolted
the
third
side
was
a
blank
wall
beyond
which
lay
the
library
on
the
fourth
side
were
the
double
doors
into
the
hall
as
although
the
results
we
obtained
were
far
beyond
any
expectations
the
purely
physical
phenomena
were
relatively
insignificant
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
further
into
the
detail
of
the
room
robinson
has
done
that
anyhow
for
the
society
of
psychical
research
a
proceeding
to
which
i
was
opposed
as
will
be
understood
by
the
close
of
the
narrative
further
to
satisfy
dane
we
examined
the
walls
and
carefully
and
herbert
armed
with
a
candle
went
down
to
the
cellar
and
investigated
from
below
returning
to
announce
in
a
loud
voice
which
made
us
all
jump
that
it
seemed
all
clear
enough
down
there
after
that
we
sat
and
waited
and
i
daresay
the
bareness
and
darkness
of
the
room
put
us
into
excellent
receptive
condition
i
know
that
i
myself
probably
owing
to
an
astigmatism
once
or
twice
felt
that
i
saw
wavering
shadows
in
corners
and
i
felt
again
some
of
the
strangeness
i
had
felt
during
the
day
we
spoke
in
whispers
and
alice
robinson
recited
the
history
of
a
haunted
house
where
she
had
visited
in
england
but
herbert
was
still
cynical
he
said
i
remember
here
we
are
six
intelligent
persons
of
above
the
average
grade
and
in
a
few
minutes
our
hair
will
be
rising
and
our
pulses
hammering
while
a
choctaw
indian
control
in
atrocious
english
will
tell
us
she
is
happy
and
we
are
happy
and
so
everybody
s
happy
hanky
panky
you
may
be
as
skeptical
as
you
please
if
you
will
only
be
fair
herbert
dane
said
and
by
that
you
mean
during
the
sitting
keep
an
open
mind
and
a
closed
mouth
she
replied
cheerfully
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
this
is
not
a
ghost
story
parts
of
it
we
now
understand
other
parts
we
do
not
for
the
physical
phenomena
we
have
no
adequate
explanation
they
occurred
we
saw
and
heard
them
for
the
other
part
of
the
seance
we
have
come
to
a
conclusion
satisfactory
to
ourselves
a
conclusion
not
reached
however
until
some
of
us
had
gone
through
some
dangerous
experiences
and
had
been
brought
into
contact
with
things
hitherto
outside
the
orderly
progression
of
our
lives
but
at
no
time
although
incredible
things
happened
did
any
one
of
us
glimpse
that
strange
world
of
the
spirit
that
seemed
so
often
almost
within
our
range
of
vision
miss
jeremy
the
medium
was
due
at
and
at
my
wife
assisted
dane
into
one
of
the
straight
chairs
at
the
table
and
sperry
sent
out
by
her
returned
with
a
darkish
bundle
in
his
arms
and
carrying
a
light
bamboo
rod
don
t
ask
me
what
they
are
for
he
said
to
herbert
s
grin
of
amusement
every
workman
has
his
herbert
examined
the
rod
but
it
was
what
it
appeared
to
be
and
nothing
else
some
one
had
started
the
phonograph
in
the
library
and
it
was
playing
gloomily
shall
we
meet
beyond
the
river
at
sperry
s
request
we
stopped
talking
and
composed
ourselves
and
herbert
i
remember
took
a
tablet
of
some
sort
to
our
intense
annoyance
and
crunched
it
in
his
teeth
then
miss
jeremy
came
in
she
was
not
at
all
what
we
had
expected
i
should
say
and
in
a
black
dinner
dress
she
seemed
like
a
perfectly
normal
young
woman
even
attractive
in
a
fragile
delicate
way
not
much
personality
perhaps
the
very
word
medium
precludes
that
a
sensitive
i
think
she
called
herself
we
were
presented
to
her
and
but
for
the
stripped
and
bare
room
it
might
have
been
any
evening
after
any
dinner
with
bridge
waiting
when
she
shook
hands
with
me
she
looked
at
me
keenly
what
a
strange
day
it
has
been
she
said
i
have
been
very
nervous
i
only
hope
i
can
do
what
you
want
this
i
am
not
at
all
sure
what
we
do
want
miss
jeremy
i
replied
she
smiled
a
quick
smile
that
was
not
without
humor
somehow
i
had
never
thought
of
a
medium
with
a
sense
of
humor
i
liked
her
at
once
we
all
liked
her
and
sperry
sperry
the
bachelor
the
iconoclast
the
antifeminist
was
staring
at
her
with
curiously
intent
eyes
following
her
entrance
herbert
had
closed
and
bolted
the
doors
and
as
an
added
precaution
he
now
drew
dane
s
empty
wheeled
chair
across
them
anything
that
comes
in
he
boasted
will
come
through
the
keyhole
or
down
the
and
then
eying
the
fireplace
he
deliberately
took
a
picture
from
the
wall
and
set
it
on
the
fender
miss
jeremy
gave
the
room
only
the
most
casual
of
glances
where
shall
i
sit
she
asked
dane
indicated
her
place
and
she
asked
for
a
small
stand
to
be
brought
in
and
placed
about
two
feet
behind
her
chair
and
two
chairs
to
flank
it
and
then
to
take
the
black
cloth
from
the
table
and
hang
it
over
the
bamboo
rod
which
was
laid
across
the
backs
of
the
chairs
thus
arranged
the
curtain
formed
a
low
screen
behind
her
with
the
stand
beyond
it
on
this
stand
we
placed
at
her
order
various
articles
from
our
pockets
i
a
fountain
pen
sperry
a
knife
and
my
wife
contributed
a
gold
bracelet
we
all
felt
i
fancy
rather
absurd
herbert
s
smile
in
the
dim
light
became
a
grin
the
same
old
thing
he
whispered
to
me
watch
her
closely
they
do
it
with
a
folding
we
arranged
between
us
that
we
were
to
sit
one
on
each
side
of
her
and
sperry
warned
me
not
to
let
go
of
her
hand
for
a
moment
they
have
a
way
of
switching
hands
he
explained
in
a
whisper
if
she
wants
to
scratch
her
nose
i
ll
scratch
we
were
we
discovered
not
to
touch
the
table
but
to
sit
around
it
at
a
distance
of
a
few
inches
holding
hands
and
thus
forming
the
circle
and
for
twenty
minutes
we
sat
thus
and
nothing
happened
she
was
fully
conscious
and
even
spoke
once
or
twice
and
at
last
she
moved
impatiently
and
told
us
to
put
our
hands
on
the
table
i
had
put
my
opened
watch
on
the
table
before
me
a
night
watch
with
a
luminous
dial
at
five
minutes
after
nine
i
felt
the
top
of
the
table
waver
under
my
fingers
a
curious
motion
the
table
is
going
to
move
i
said
herbert
laughed
a
dry
little
chuckle
sure
it
is
he
said
when
we
all
get
to
acting
together
it
will
probably
do
considerable
moving
i
feel
what
you
feel
it
s
flowing
under
my
blood
said
sperry
you
fellows
feel
the
blood
moving
through
the
ends
of
your
fingers
that
s
all
don
t
be
however
curiously
enough
the
table
did
not
move
instead
my
watch
before
my
eyes
slid
to
the
edge
of
the
table
and
dropped
to
the
floor
and
almost
instantly
an
object
which
we
recognized
later
as
sperry
s
knife
was
flung
over
the
curtain
and
struck
the
wall
behind
dane
violently
one
of
the
women
screamed
ending
in
a
hysterical
giggle
then
we
heard
rhythmic
beating
on
the
top
of
the
stand
behind
the
medium
startling
as
it
was
at
the
beginning
increasing
as
it
did
from
a
slow
beat
to
an
incredibly
rapid
drumming
when
the
initial
shock
was
over
herbert
commenced
to
gibe
your
fountain
pen
horace
he
said
to
me
making
out
a
statement
for
services
rendered
by
its
the
answer
to
that
was
the
pen
itself
aimed
at
him
with
apparent
accuracy
and
followed
by
an
outcry
from
him
here
stop
it
he
said
i
ve
got
ink
all
over
me
we
laughed
consumedly
the
sitting
had
taken
on
all
the
attributes
of
practical
joking
the
table
no
longer
quivered
under
my
hands
please
be
sure
you
are
holding
my
hands
tight
hold
them
very
tight
said
miss
jeremy
her
voice
sounded
faint
and
far
away
her
head
was
dropped
forward
on
her
chest
and
she
suddenly
sagged
in
her
chair
sperry
broke
the
circle
and
coming
to
her
took
her
pulse
it
was
he
reported
very
rapid
you
can
move
and
talk
now
if
you
like
he
said
she
s
in
trance
and
there
will
be
no
more
physical
dane
was
the
first
to
speak
i
was
looking
for
my
fountain
pen
and
herbert
was
again
examining
the
stand
i
believe
it
now
dane
said
i
saw
your
watch
go
horace
but
tomorrow
i
won
t
believe
it
at
how
about
your
companion
i
asked
can
she
take
shorthand
we
ought
to
have
a
probably
not
in
the
we
can
have
some
light
now
sperry
said
there
was
a
sort
of
restrained
movement
in
the
room
now
herbert
turned
on
a
bracket
light
and
i
moved
away
the
roller
chair
go
and
get
clara
horace
dane
said
to
me
and
have
her
bring
a
and
nothing
i
believe
happened
during
my
absence
miss
jeremy
was
sunk
in
her
chair
and
breathing
heavily
when
i
came
back
with
clara
and
sperry
was
still
watching
her
pulse
suddenly
my
wife
said
why
look
she
s
wearing
my
bracelet
this
proved
to
be
the
case
and
was
i
regret
to
say
the
cause
of
a
most
unjust
suspicion
on
my
wife
s
part
even
today
with
all
the
knowledge
she
possesses
i
am
certain
that
johnson
believes
that
some
mysterious
power
took
my
watch
and
dragged
it
off
the
table
and
threw
the
pen
but
that
i
myself
under
cover
of
darkness
placed
her
bracelet
on
miss
jeremy
s
arm
i
can
only
reiterate
here
what
i
have
told
her
many
times
that
i
never
touched
the
bracelet
after
it
was
placed
on
the
stand
take
down
everything
that
happens
clara
and
all
we
say
dane
said
in
a
low
tone
even
if
it
sounds
like
nonsense
put
it
it
is
because
clara
took
her
orders
literally
that
i
am
making
this
more
readable
version
of
her
script
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
matter
which
would
only
cloud
the
statement
if
rendered
word
for
word
and
also
certain
scattered
unrelated
words
with
which
many
of
the
statements
terminated
for
instance
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
just
above
the
ear
came
a
number
of
rhymes
to
the
final
word
dear
near
fear
rear
cheer
three
these
i
have
cut
for
the
sake
of
clearness
for
some
five
minutes
perhaps
miss
jeremy
breathed
stertorously
and
it
was
during
that
interval
that
we
introduced
clara
and
took
up
our
positions
sperry
sat
near
the
medium
now
having
changed
places
with
herbert
and
the
rest
of
us
were
as
we
had
been
save
that
we
no
longer
touched
hands
suddenly
miss
jeremy
began
to
breathe
more
quietly
and
to
move
about
in
her
chair
then
she
sat
upright
good
evening
friends
she
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
all
i
caught
herbert
s
eye
and
he
grinned
good
evening
little
bright
eyes
he
said
how
s
everything
in
the
happy
hunting
ground
tonight
dark
and
cold
she
said
dark
and
cold
and
the
knee
hurts
it
s
very
bad
if
the
key
is
on
the
nail
arnica
will
take
the
pain
she
lapsed
into
silence
in
transcribing
clara
s
record
i
shall
make
no
reference
to
these
pauses
which
were
frequent
and
occasionally
filled
in
with
extraneous
matter
for
instance
once
there
was
what
amounted
to
five
minutes
of
mother
goose
jingles
our
method
was
simply
one
of
question
by
one
of
ourselves
and
of
answer
by
miss
jeremy
these
replies
were
usually
in
a
querulous
tone
and
were
often
apparently
unwilling
also
occasionally
there
was
a
bit
of
vernacular
as
in
the
next
reply
herbert
who
was
still
flippantly
amused
said
don
t
bother
about
your
knee
give
us
some
local
stuff
gossip
if
you
sure
i
can
and
it
will
make
your
hair
then
suddenly
there
was
a
sort
of
dramatic
pause
and
then
an
outburst
he
s
who
is
dead
sperry
asked
with
his
voice
drawn
a
trifle
thin
a
bullet
just
above
the
ear
that
s
a
bad
place
thank
goodness
there
s
not
much
blood
cold
water
will
take
it
out
of
the
carpet
not
hot
not
hot
do
you
want
to
set
the
stain
look
here
sperry
said
looking
around
the
table
i
don
t
like
this
it
s
darned
oh
fudge
herbert
put
in
irreverently
let
her
rave
or
it
or
whatever
it
is
do
you
mean
that
a
man
is
dead
to
the
medium
yes
she
has
the
revolver
she
needn
t
cry
so
he
was
cruel
to
her
he
was
a
beast
can
you
see
the
woman
i
asked
if
it
s
sent
out
to
be
cleaned
it
will
cause
trouble
hang
it
in
the
herbert
muttered
something
about
the
movies
having
nothing
on
us
and
was
angrily
hushed
there
was
something
quite
outside
of
miss
jeremy
s
words
that
had
impressed
itself
on
all
of
us
with
a
sense
of
unexpected
but
very
real
tragedy
as
i
look
back
i
believe
it
was
a
sort
of
desperation
in
her
voice
but
then
came
one
of
those
interruptions
which
were
to
annoy
us
considerably
during
the
series
of
sittings
she
began
to
recite
childe
harold
when
that
was
over
now
then
sperry
said
in
a
businesslike
voice
you
see
a
dead
man
and
a
young
woman
with
him
can
you
describe
the
room
a
small
room
his
he
was
shaving
there
is
still
lather
on
his
and
the
woman
killed
him
i
don
t
know
oh
i
don
t
know
no
she
didn
t
he
did
it
he
did
it
himself
there
was
no
answer
to
that
but
a
sort
of
sulky
silence
are
you
getting
this
clara
dane
asked
sharply
don
t
miss
a
word
who
knows
what
this
may
develop
into
i
looked
at
the
secretary
and
it
was
clear
that
she
was
terrified
i
got
up
and
took
my
chair
to
her
coming
back
i
picked
up
my
forgotten
watch
from
the
floor
it
was
still
going
and
the
hands
marked
now
sperry
said
in
a
soothing
tone
you
said
there
was
a
shot
fired
and
a
man
was
killed
where
was
this
what
house
two
shots
one
is
in
the
ceiling
of
the
and
the
other
killed
him
but
here
instead
of
a
reply
we
got
the
words
library
quite
without
warning
the
medium
groaned
and
sperry
believed
the
trance
was
over
she
s
coming
out
he
said
a
glass
of
wine
but
she
did
not
come
out
instead
she
twisted
in
the
chair
he
s
so
heavy
to
lift
she
muttered
then
get
the
lather
off
his
face
the
lather
the
she
subsided
into
the
chair
and
began
to
breathe
with
difficulty
i
want
to
go
out
i
want
air
if
i
could
only
go
to
sleep
and
forget
it
the
furniture
is
scattered
over
the
this
last
sentence
she
repeated
over
and
over
it
got
on
our
nerves
ragged
already
can
you
tell
us
about
the
house
there
was
a
distinct
pause
then
certainly
a
brick
house
the
servants
entrance
is
locked
but
the
key
is
on
a
nail
among
the
vines
all
the
furniture
is
scattered
through
the
she
must
mean
the
furniture
of
this
room
dane
whispered
the
remainder
of
the
sitting
was
chaotic
the
secretary
s
notes
consist
of
unrelated
words
and
often
childish
verses
on
going
over
the
notes
the
next
day
when
the
stenographic
record
had
been
copied
on
a
typewriter
sperry
and
i
found
that
one
word
recurred
frequently
the
word
was
of
the
extraordinary
event
that
followed
the
breaking
up
of
the
seance
i
have
the
keenest
recollection
miss
jeremy
came
out
of
her
trance
weak
and
looking
extremely
ill
and
sperry
s
motor
took
her
home
she
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
and
hoped
we
had
been
satisfied
by
agreement
we
did
not
tell
her
what
had
transpired
and
she
was
not
curious
herbert
saw
her
to
the
car
and
came
back
looking
grave
we
were
standing
together
in
the
center
of
the
dismantled
room
with
the
lights
going
full
now
well
he
said
it
is
one
of
two
things
either
we
ve
been
gloriously
faked
or
we
ve
been
let
in
on
a
very
tidy
little
it
was
dane
s
custom
to
serve
a
southern
eggnog
as
a
sort
of
nightcap
she
calls
it
on
her
evenings
and
we
found
it
waiting
for
us
in
the
library
in
the
warmth
of
its
open
fire
and
the
cheer
of
its
lamps
even
in
the
dignity
and
impassiveness
of
the
butler
there
was
something
sane
and
wholesome
the
women
of
the
party
reacted
quickly
but
i
looked
over
to
see
sperry
at
a
corner
desk
intently
working
over
a
small
object
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
started
when
he
heard
me
then
laughed
and
held
out
his
hand
library
paste
he
said
it
rolls
into
a
soft
malleable
ball
it
could
quite
easily
be
used
to
fill
a
small
hole
in
plaster
the
paper
would
paste
down
over
it
then
you
think
i
m
not
thinking
at
all
the
thing
she
described
may
have
taken
place
in
timbuctoo
may
have
happened
ten
years
ago
may
be
the
plot
of
some
book
she
has
on
the
other
hand
i
replied
it
is
just
possible
that
it
was
here
in
this
neighborhood
while
we
were
sitting
in
that
have
you
any
idea
of
the
time
i
know
exactly
it
was
iii
at
midnight
shortly
after
we
reached
home
sperry
called
me
on
the
phone
be
careful
horace
he
said
don
t
let
horace
think
anything
has
happened
i
want
to
see
you
at
once
suppose
you
say
i
have
a
patient
in
a
bad
way
and
a
will
to
be
i
listened
to
sounds
from
upstairs
i
heard
my
wife
go
into
her
room
and
close
the
door
tell
me
something
about
it
i
urged
just
this
arthur
wells
killed
himself
tonight
shot
himself
in
the
head
i
want
you
to
go
there
with
arthur
wells
yes
i
say
horace
did
you
happen
to
notice
the
time
the
seance
began
tonight
it
was
five
minutes
after
nine
when
my
watch
then
it
would
have
been
about
half
past
when
the
trance
began
there
was
a
silence
at
sperry
s
end
of
the
wire
then
he
was
shot
about
he
said
and
rang
off
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
that
my
hands
shook
as
i
hung
up
the
receiver
a
brick
house
she
had
said
the
wells
house
was
brick
and
so
were
all
the
other
houses
on
the
street
vines
in
the
back
well
even
my
own
house
had
vines
it
was
absurd
it
was
pure
coincidence
it
was
well
i
felt
it
was
queer
nevertheless
as
i
stood
there
i
wondered
for
the
first
time
in
a
highly
material
existence
whether
there
might
not
be
after
all
a
surrounding
us
cognizant
of
all
that
we
did
touching
but
intangible
sentient
but
tuned
above
our
common
senses
i
stood
by
the
prosaic
telephone
instrument
and
looked
into
the
darkened
recesses
of
the
passage
it
seemed
to
my
disordered
nerves
that
back
of
the
coats
and
wraps
that
hung
on
the
rack
beyond
the
heavy
curtains
in
every
corner
there
lurked
vague
and
shadowy
forms
invisible
when
i
stared
but
advancing
a
trifle
from
their
obscurity
when
by
turning
my
head
and
looking
ahead
they
impinged
on
the
extreme
right
or
left
of
my
field
of
vision
i
was
shocked
by
the
news
but
not
greatly
grieved
the
wellses
had
been
among
us
but
not
of
us
as
i
have
said
they
had
come
like
gay
young
comets
into
our
orderly
constellation
trailing
behind
them
their
cars
and
servants
their
children
and
governesses
and
rather
riotous
friends
and
had
flashed
on
us
in
a
sort
of
bright
impermanence
of
the
two
i
myself
had
preferred
arthur
his
faults
were
on
the
surface
he
drank
hard
gambled
and
could
not
always
pay
his
gambling
debts
but
underneath
it
all
there
had
always
been
something
boyishly
honest
about
him
he
had
played
it
is
true
through
most
of
the
thirty
years
that
now
marked
his
whole
life
but
he
could
have
been
made
a
man
by
the
right
woman
and
he
had
married
the
wrong
one
of
elinor
wells
i
have
only
my
wife
s
verdict
and
i
have
found
that
as
is
the
way
with
many
good
women
her
judgments
of
her
own
sex
are
rather
merciless
a
tall
handsome
girl
very
dark
my
wife
has
characterized
her
as
cold
calculating
and
ambitious
she
has
said
frequently
too
that
elinor
wells
was
a
disappointed
woman
that
her
marriage
while
giving
her
social
identity
had
disappointed
her
in
a
monetary
way
whether
that
is
true
or
not
there
was
no
doubt
by
the
time
they
had
lived
in
our
neighborhood
for
a
year
that
a
complication
had
arisen
in
the
shape
of
another
man
my
wife
on
my
return
from
my
office
in
the
evening
had
been
quite
likely
to
greet
me
with
horace
he
has
been
there
all
afternoon
i
really
think
something
should
be
done
about
who
has
been
where
i
would
ask
i
am
afraid
not
too
patiently
you
know
perfectly
well
and
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
in
spite
of
her
vague
pronouns
i
understood
and
in
a
more
masculine
way
i
shared
her
sense
of
outrage
our
street
has
never
had
a
scandal
on
it
except
the
one
when
the
berringtons
music
teacher
ran
away
with
their
coachman
in
the
days
of
carriages
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
that
is
almost
forgotten
nevertheless
we
had
realized
for
some
time
that
the
dreaded
triangle
was
threatening
the
repute
of
our
quiet
neighborhood
and
as
i
stood
by
the
telephone
that
night
i
saw
that
it
had
come
more
than
that
it
seemed
very
probable
that
into
this
very
triangle
our
peaceful
neighborhood
club
had
been
suddenly
thrust
my
wife
accepted
my
excuse
coldly
she
dislikes
intensely
the
occasional
outside
calls
of
my
profession
she
merely
observed
however
that
she
would
leave
all
the
lights
on
until
my
return
i
should
think
you
could
arrange
things
better
horace
she
added
it
s
perfectly
idiotic
the
way
people
die
at
night
and
tonight
of
all
nights
i
shall
have
to
confess
that
through
all
of
the
thirty
years
of
our
married
life
my
wife
has
clung
to
the
belief
that
i
am
a
bit
of
a
dog
thirty
years
of
exemplary
living
have
not
affected
this
conviction
nor
had
herbert
s
foolish
remark
earlier
in
the
evening
helped
matters
but
she
watched
me
put
on
my
overcoat
without
further
comment
when
i
kissed
her
however
she
turned
her
cheek
the
street
with
its
open
spaces
was
a
relief
after
the
dark
hall
i
started
for
sperry
s
house
my
head
bent
against
the
wind
my
mind
on
the
news
i
had
just
heard
was
it
i
wondered
just
possible
that
we
had
for
some
reason
been
allowed
behind
the
veil
which
covered
poor
wells
last
moments
and
to
admit
that
for
a
moment
where
would
what
we
had
heard
lead
us
sperry
had
said
he
had
killed
himself
but
suppose
he
had
not
i
realize
now
looking
back
that
my
recollection
of
the
other
man
in
the
triangle
is
largely
colored
by
the
fact
that
he
fell
in
the
great
war
at
that
time
i
hardly
knew
him
except
as
a
wealthy
and
man
in
his
late
thirties
i
saw
him
now
and
then
in
the
club
playing
billiards
or
going
in
and
out
of
the
wells
house
a
large
fastidiously
dressed
man
strong
featured
and
broad
shouldered
with
rather
too
much
manner
i
remember
particularly
how
i
hated
the
light
spats
he
affected
and
the
glaring
yellow
gloves
a
man
who
would
go
straight
for
the
thing
he
wanted
woman
or
power
or
money
and
get
it
sperry
was
waiting
on
his
and
we
went
on
to
the
wells
house
what
with
the
magnitude
of
the
thing
that
had
happened
and
our
mutual
feeling
that
we
were
somehow
involved
in
it
we
were
rather
silent
sperry
asked
one
question
however
are
you
certain
about
the
time
when
miss
jeremy
saw
what
looks
like
this
thing
certainly
my
watch
fell
at
five
minutes
after
nine
when
it
was
all
over
and
i
picked
it
up
it
was
still
going
and
it
was
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
the
wellses
nursery
governess
telephoned
for
me
at
we
keep
a
record
of
the
time
of
all
sperry
is
a
heart
specialist
i
think
i
have
said
with
offices
in
his
house
and
a
block
or
so
farther
on
i
suppose
it
was
bound
to
come
to
tell
the
truth
i
didn
t
think
the
boy
had
the
then
you
think
he
did
it
they
say
so
he
said
grimly
and
added
irritably
good
heavens
horace
we
must
keep
that
other
fool
thing
out
of
our
yes
i
agreed
we
although
the
wells
house
was
brilliantly
lighted
when
we
reached
it
we
had
difficulty
in
gaining
admission
whoever
were
in
the
house
were
and
the
bell
evidently
rang
in
the
deserted
kitchen
or
a
neighboring
pantry
we
might
try
the
servants
entrance
sperry
said
then
he
laughed
mirthlessly
we
might
see
he
said
if
there
s
a
key
on
the
nail
among
the
i
confess
to
a
nervous
tightening
of
my
muscles
as
we
made
our
way
around
the
house
if
the
key
was
there
we
were
on
the
track
of
a
revelation
that
might
revolutionize
much
that
we
had
held
fundamental
in
science
and
in
our
knowledge
of
life
itself
if
sitting
in
dane
s
quiet
room
a
woman
could
tell
us
what
was
happening
in
a
house
a
mile
or
so
away
it
opened
up
a
new
earth
almost
a
new
heaven
i
stopped
and
touched
sperry
s
arm
this
miss
jeremy
did
she
know
arthur
wells
or
elinor
if
she
knew
the
house
and
the
situation
between
them
isn
t
it
barely
possible
that
she
anticipated
this
thing
we
knew
them
he
said
gruffly
and
whatever
we
anticipated
it
wasn
t
sperry
had
a
pocket
flash
and
when
we
found
the
door
locked
we
proceeded
with
our
search
for
the
key
the
porch
had
been
covered
with
heavy
vines
now
dead
of
the
november
frosts
and
showing
here
and
there
dead
and
dried
leaves
that
crackled
as
we
touched
them
in
the
darkness
something
leaped
against
me
and
i
almost
cried
out
it
was
however
only
a
collie
dog
eager
for
the
warmth
of
his
place
by
the
kitchen
fire
here
s
the
key
sperry
said
and
held
it
out
the
flash
wavered
in
his
hand
and
his
voice
was
strained
so
far
so
good
i
replied
and
was
conscious
that
my
own
voice
rang
strange
in
my
ears
we
admitted
ourselves
and
the
dog
bounding
past
us
gave
a
sharp
yelp
of
gratitude
and
ran
into
the
kitchen
look
here
sperry
i
said
as
we
stood
inside
the
door
they
don
t
want
me
here
they
ve
sent
for
you
but
i
m
the
most
casual
sort
of
an
acquaintance
i
haven
t
any
business
that
struck
him
too
we
had
both
been
so
obsessed
with
the
scene
at
dane
s
that
we
had
not
thought
of
anything
else
suppose
you
sit
down
in
the
library
he
said
the
chances
are
against
her
coming
down
and
the
servants
don
t
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
learned
later
that
all
the
servants
were
out
except
the
nursery
governess
there
were
two
small
children
there
was
a
servants
ball
somewhere
and
with
the
exception
of
the
butler
it
was
after
two
before
they
commenced
to
straggle
in
except
two
men
from
the
central
office
a
physician
who
was
with
elinor
in
her
room
and
the
governess
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
house
but
the
children
asleep
in
the
nursery
as
i
sat
alone
in
the
library
the
house
was
perfectly
silent
but
in
some
strange
fashion
it
had
apparently
taken
on
the
attributes
of
the
deed
that
had
preceded
the
silence
it
was
sinister
mysterious
dark
its
immediate
effect
on
my
imagination
was
apprehension
almost
terror
murder
or
suicide
here
among
the
shadows
a
soul
an
indestructible
thing
had
been
recently
violently
wrenched
from
its
body
the
body
lay
in
the
room
overhead
but
what
of
the
spirit
i
shivered
as
i
thought
that
it
might
even
then
be
watching
me
with
formless
eyes
from
some
dark
corner
overwrought
as
i
was
i
was
forced
to
bring
my
common
sense
to
bear
on
the
situation
here
was
a
tragedy
a
real
and
terrible
one
suppose
we
had
in
some
queer
fashion
touched
its
outer
edges
that
night
then
how
was
it
that
there
had
come
mixed
up
with
so
much
that
might
be
pertinent
such
extraneous
and
grotesque
things
as
childe
harold
a
hurt
knee
and
mother
goose
i
remember
moving
impatiently
and
trying
to
argue
myself
into
my
ordinary
logical
state
of
mind
but
i
know
now
that
even
then
i
was
wondering
whether
sperry
had
found
a
hole
in
the
ceiling
upstairs
i
wandered
i
recall
into
the
realm
of
the
clairvoyant
and
the
clairaudient
under
certain
conditions
such
as
trance
i
knew
that
some
individuals
claimed
a
power
of
vision
that
was
supernormal
and
i
had
at
one
time
lunched
at
my
club
with
a
gentleman
in
a
pince
nez
who
said
the
room
was
full
of
people
i
could
not
see
but
who
were
perfectly
distinct
to
him
he
claimed
and
i
certainly
could
not
refute
him
that
he
saw
further
into
the
violet
of
the
spectrum
than
the
rest
of
us
and
seemed
to
consider
it
nothing
unusual
when
an
elderly
woman
whose
description
sounded
much
like
my
came
and
stood
behind
my
chair
i
recall
that
he
said
she
was
stroking
my
hair
and
that
following
that
i
had
a
distinctly
creepy
sensation
along
my
scalp
then
there
were
those
who
claimed
that
in
trance
the
spirit
of
the
medium
giving
place
to
a
control
was
free
to
roam
whither
it
would
and
although
i
am
not
sure
of
this
that
it
wandered
in
the
fourth
dimension
while
i
am
very
vague
about
the
fourth
dimension
i
did
know
that
in
it
doors
and
walls
were
not
obstacles
but
as
they
would
not
be
obstacles
to
a
spirit
even
in
the
world
as
we
know
it
that
got
me
nowhere
suppose
sperry
came
down
and
said
arthur
wells
had
been
shot
above
the
ear
and
that
there
was
a
second
bullet
hole
in
the
ceiling
added
to
the
key
on
the
nail
a
careless
custom
and
surely
not
common
we
would
have
conclusive
proof
that
our
medium
had
been
correct
there
was
another
point
too
miss
jeremy
had
said
get
the
lather
off
his
that
brought
me
up
with
a
turn
would
a
man
stop
shaving
to
kill
himself
if
he
did
why
a
revolver
why
not
the
razor
in
his
hand
i
knew
from
my
law
experience
that
suicide
is
either
a
desperate
impulse
or
a
and
calculated
finality
a
man
who
kills
himself
while
dressing
comes
under
the
former
classification
and
will
usually
seize
the
first
method
at
hand
but
there
was
something
else
too
shaving
is
an
automatic
process
it
completes
itself
my
wife
has
an
irritated
conviction
that
if
the
house
caught
fire
while
i
was
in
the
midst
of
the
process
i
would
complete
it
and
rinse
the
soap
from
my
face
before
i
caught
up
the
had
he
killed
himself
or
had
elinor
killed
him
was
she
the
sort
to
sacrifice
herself
to
a
violent
impulse
would
she
choose
the
hard
way
when
there
was
the
easy
one
of
the
divorce
court
i
thought
not
and
the
same
was
true
of
ellingham
here
were
two
people
both
of
them
careful
of
appearance
if
not
of
fact
there
was
another
possibility
too
that
he
had
learned
something
while
he
was
dressing
had
attacked
or
threatened
her
with
a
razor
and
she
had
killed
him
in
i
had
reached
that
point
when
sperry
came
down
the
staircase
ushering
out
the
detectives
and
the
medical
man
he
came
to
the
library
door
and
stood
looking
at
me
with
his
face
rather
paler
than
usual
i
ll
take
you
up
now
he
said
she
s
in
her
room
in
bed
and
she
has
had
an
was
he
shot
above
the
ear
i
did
not
look
at
him
nor
he
at
me
we
climbed
the
stairs
and
entered
the
room
where
according
to
elinor
s
story
arthur
wells
had
killed
himself
it
was
a
as
miss
jeremy
had
described
a
wardrobe
a
table
with
books
and
magazines
in
disorder
two
chairs
and
a
couch
constituted
the
furnishings
beyond
was
a
bathroom
on
a
chair
by
a
window
the
dead
mans
s
evening
clothes
were
neatly
laid
out
his
shoes
beneath
his
top
hat
and
folded
gloves
were
on
the
table
arthur
wells
lay
on
the
couch
a
sheet
had
been
drawn
over
the
body
and
i
did
not
disturb
it
it
gave
the
impression
of
unusual
length
that
is
always
found
i
think
in
the
dead
and
a
breath
of
air
from
an
open
window
by
stirring
the
sheet
gave
a
false
appearance
of
life
beneath
the
house
was
absolutely
still
when
i
glanced
at
sperry
he
was
staring
at
the
ceiling
and
i
followed
his
eyes
but
there
was
no
mark
on
it
sperry
made
a
little
gesture
it
s
queer
he
muttered
it
s
the
detective
and
i
put
him
there
he
was
he
showed
a
place
on
the
floor
midway
of
the
room
where
was
his
head
lying
i
asked
cautiously
i
stooped
and
examined
the
carpet
it
was
a
dark
oriental
with
much
red
in
it
i
touched
the
place
and
then
ran
my
folded
handkerchief
over
it
it
came
up
stained
with
blood
there
would
be
no
object
in
using
cold
water
there
so
as
not
to
set
the
stain
sperry
said
thoughtfully
whether
he
fell
there
or
not
that
is
where
she
allowed
him
to
be
you
don
t
think
he
fell
there
she
dragged
him
didn
t
she
he
demanded
then
the
strangeness
of
what
he
was
saying
struck
him
and
he
smiled
foolishly
what
i
mean
is
the
medium
said
she
did
i
don
t
suppose
any
jury
would
pass
us
tonight
as
entirely
sane
horace
he
said
he
walked
across
to
the
bathroom
and
surveyed
it
from
the
doorway
i
followed
him
it
was
as
orderly
as
the
other
room
on
a
glass
shelf
over
the
were
his
razors
a
safety
and
beside
it
in
a
black
case
an
assortment
of
the
variety
one
for
each
day
of
the
week
and
so
marked
sperry
stood
thoughtfully
in
the
doorway
the
servants
are
out
he
said
according
to
elinor
s
statement
he
was
dressing
when
he
did
it
and
yet
some
one
has
had
a
wild
impulse
for
tidiness
here
since
it
happened
not
a
towel
out
of
place
it
was
in
the
bathroom
that
he
told
me
elinor
s
story
according
to
her
it
was
a
simple
case
of
suicide
and
she
was
honest
about
it
in
her
own
way
she
was
shocked
but
she
was
not
pretending
any
wild
grief
she
hadn
t
wanted
him
to
die
but
she
had
not
felt
that
they
could
go
on
much
longer
together
there
had
been
no
quarrel
other
than
their
usual
bickering
they
had
been
going
to
a
dance
that
night
the
servants
had
all
gone
out
immediately
after
dinner
to
a
servants
ball
and
the
governess
had
gone
for
a
walk
she
was
to
return
at
to
fasten
elinor
s
gown
and
to
be
with
the
children
arthur
she
said
had
been
depressed
for
several
days
and
at
dinner
had
hardly
spoken
at
all
he
had
not
however
objected
to
the
dance
he
had
indeed
seemed
strangely
determined
to
go
although
she
had
pleaded
a
headache
at
nine
o
clock
he
went
upstairs
apparently
to
dress
she
was
in
her
room
with
the
door
shut
when
she
heard
a
shot
she
ran
in
and
found
him
lying
on
the
floor
of
his
with
his
revolver
behind
him
the
governess
was
still
out
the
shot
had
roused
the
children
and
they
had
come
down
from
the
nursery
above
she
was
frantic
but
she
had
to
soothe
them
the
governess
however
came
in
almost
immediately
and
she
had
sent
her
to
the
telephone
to
summon
help
calling
sperry
first
of
all
and
then
the
police
have
you
seen
the
revolver
i
asked
yes
it
s
all
right
apparently
only
one
shot
had
been
how
soon
did
they
get
a
doctor
it
must
have
been
some
time
they
gave
up
telephoning
and
the
governess
went
out
finally
and
found
then
while
she
was
out
possibly
sperry
said
if
we
start
with
the
hypothesis
that
she
was
if
she
cleaned
up
here
for
any
reason
i
began
and
commenced
a
desultory
examination
of
the
room
just
why
i
looked
behind
the
bathtub
forces
me
to
an
explanation
i
am
somewhat
loath
to
make
but
which
will
explain
a
rather
unusual
proceeding
for
some
time
my
wife
has
felt
that
i
smoked
too
heavily
and
out
of
her
solicitude
for
me
has
limited
me
to
one
cigar
after
dinner
but
as
i
have
been
a
heavy
smoker
for
years
i
have
found
this
a
great
hardship
and
have
therefore
kept
a
reserve
store
by
arrangement
with
the
housemaid
behind
my
tub
in
i
must
also
state
that
i
seldom
have
recourse
to
such
stealthy
measures
believing
then
that
something
might
possibly
be
hidden
there
i
made
an
investigation
and
could
see
some
small
objects
lying
there
sperry
brought
me
a
stick
from
the
and
with
its
aid
succeeded
in
bringing
out
the
two
articles
which
were
instrumental
in
starting
us
on
our
brief
but
adventurous
careers
as
private
investigators
one
was
a
leather
razor
strop
old
and
stiff
from
disuse
and
the
other
a
wet
bath
sponge
now
stained
with
blood
to
a
yellowish
brown
she
is
lying
sperry
i
said
he
fell
somewhere
else
and
she
dragged
him
to
where
he
was
but
why
i
don
t
know
i
said
impatiently
from
some
place
where
a
man
would
be
unlikely
to
kill
himself
i
daresay
no
one
ever
killed
himself
for
instance
in
an
open
hallway
or
stopped
shaving
to
do
we
have
only
miss
jeremy
s
word
for
that
he
said
sullenly
confound
it
horace
don
t
let
s
bring
in
that
stuff
if
we
can
help
we
stared
at
each
other
with
the
strop
and
the
sponge
between
us
suddenly
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
back
into
the
room
and
a
moment
later
he
called
me
quietly
you
re
right
he
said
the
poor
devil
was
shaving
he
had
it
half
done
come
and
but
i
did
not
go
there
was
a
carafe
of
water
in
the
bathroom
and
i
took
a
drink
from
it
my
hands
were
shaking
when
i
turned
around
i
found
sperry
in
the
hall
examining
the
carpet
with
his
flash
light
and
now
and
then
stooping
to
run
his
hand
over
the
floor
nothing
here
he
said
in
a
low
tone
when
i
had
joined
him
at
least
i
haven
t
found
iv
how
much
of
sperry
s
proceeding
with
the
carpet
the
governess
had
seen
i
do
not
know
i
glanced
up
and
she
was
there
on
the
staircase
to
the
third
floor
watching
us
i
did
not
know
then
whether
she
recognized
me
or
not
for
the
wellses
servants
were
as
oblivious
of
the
families
on
the
street
as
their
employers
but
she
knew
sperry
and
was
ready
enough
to
talk
to
him
how
is
she
now
she
asked
she
is
sleeping
the
children
she
came
down
the
stairs
a
lean
young
frenchwoman
in
a
dark
dressing
gown
and
sperry
suggested
that
she
too
should
have
an
opiate
she
seized
at
the
idea
but
sperry
did
not
go
down
at
once
for
his
professional
bag
you
were
not
here
when
it
occurred
mademoiselle
he
inquired
no
doctor
i
had
been
out
for
a
she
clasped
her
hands
when
i
came
back
was
he
still
on
the
floor
of
the
when
you
came
in
but
yes
of
course
she
was
alone
she
could
not
lift
i
see
sperry
said
thoughtfully
no
i
daresay
she
couldn
t
was
the
revolver
on
the
floor
also
yes
doctor
i
myself
picked
it
to
sperry
she
showed
i
observed
a
slight
deference
but
when
she
glanced
at
me
as
she
did
after
each
reply
i
thought
her
expression
slightly
altered
at
the
time
this
puzzled
me
but
it
was
explained
when
sperry
started
down
the
stairs
monsieur
is
of
the
police
she
asked
with
a
frenchwoman
s
timid
respect
for
the
constabulary
i
hesitated
before
i
answered
i
am
a
truthful
man
and
i
hate
unnecessary
lying
but
i
ask
consideration
of
the
circumstances
neither
then
nor
at
any
time
later
was
the
solving
of
the
wells
mystery
the
prime
motive
behind
the
course
i
laid
out
and
consistently
followed
i
felt
that
we
might
be
on
the
verge
of
some
great
psychic
discovery
one
which
would
revolutionize
human
thought
and
to
a
certain
extent
human
action
and
toward
that
end
i
was
prepared
to
go
to
almost
any
length
i
am
making
a
few
investigations
i
told
her
you
say
wells
was
alone
in
the
house
except
for
her
husband
the
mr
wells
was
shaving
i
believe
when
the
er
impulse
overtook
him
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
her
surprise
shaving
i
think
what
sort
of
razor
did
he
ordinarily
use
a
safety
razor
always
at
least
i
have
never
seen
any
others
there
is
a
case
of
razors
in
the
she
glanced
toward
the
room
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
possibly
he
used
others
i
have
not
seen
it
was
you
i
suppose
who
cleaned
up
cleaned
up
you
who
washed
up
the
stains
oh
no
monsieur
nothing
of
the
sort
has
yet
been
i
felt
that
she
was
telling
the
truth
so
far
as
she
knew
it
and
i
then
asked
about
the
revolver
do
you
know
where
wells
kept
his
revolver
when
i
first
came
it
was
in
the
drawer
of
that
table
i
suggested
that
it
be
placed
beyond
the
children
s
reach
i
do
not
know
where
it
was
do
you
recall
how
you
left
the
front
door
when
you
went
out
i
mean
was
it
locked
no
the
servants
were
out
and
i
knew
there
would
be
no
one
to
admit
me
i
left
it
but
it
was
evident
that
she
had
broken
a
rule
of
the
house
by
doing
so
for
she
added
i
am
afraid
to
use
the
servants
entrance
it
is
dark
the
key
is
always
hung
on
the
nail
when
they
are
out
yes
if
any
one
of
them
is
out
it
is
left
there
there
is
only
one
key
the
family
is
out
a
great
deal
and
it
saves
bringing
some
one
down
from
the
servants
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
but
i
think
my
knowledge
of
the
key
bothered
her
for
some
reason
and
as
i
read
over
my
questions
certainly
they
indicated
a
suspicion
that
the
situation
was
less
simple
than
it
appeared
she
shot
a
quick
glance
at
me
did
you
examine
the
revolver
when
you
picked
it
up
i
monsieur
non
then
her
fears
whatever
they
were
got
the
best
of
her
i
know
nothing
but
what
i
tell
you
i
was
out
i
can
prove
that
that
is
so
i
went
to
a
pharmacy
the
clerk
will
remember
i
will
go
with
you
monsieur
and
he
will
tell
you
that
i
used
the
telephone
i
daresay
my
business
of
of
watching
evidence
helped
me
to
my
next
question
you
went
out
to
telephone
when
there
is
a
telephone
in
the
house
but
here
again
as
once
or
twice
before
a
veil
dropped
between
us
she
avoided
my
eyes
there
are
things
one
does
not
want
the
family
to
hear
she
muttered
then
having
determined
on
a
course
of
action
she
followed
it
i
am
looking
for
another
position
i
do
not
like
it
here
the
children
are
spoiled
i
only
came
for
a
month
s
and
the
pharmacy
elliott
s
at
the
corner
of
state
avenue
and
mckee
i
told
her
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
her
to
go
to
the
pharmacy
and
she
muttered
something
about
the
children
and
went
up
the
stairs
when
sperry
came
back
with
the
opiate
she
was
nowhere
in
sight
and
he
was
considerably
annoyed
she
knows
something
i
told
him
she
is
sperry
eyed
me
with
a
half
frown
now
see
here
horace
he
said
suppose
we
had
come
in
here
without
the
thought
of
that
seance
behind
us
we
d
have
accepted
the
thing
as
it
appears
to
be
wouldn
t
we
there
may
be
a
dozen
explanations
for
that
sponge
and
for
the
razor
strop
what
in
heaven
s
name
has
a
razor
strop
to
do
with
it
anyhow
one
bullet
was
fired
and
the
revolver
has
one
empty
chamber
it
may
not
be
the
custom
to
stop
shaving
in
order
to
commit
suicide
but
that
s
no
argument
that
it
can
t
be
done
and
as
to
the
key
how
do
i
know
that
my
own
back
door
key
isn
t
hung
outside
on
a
nail
sometimes
we
might
look
again
for
that
hole
in
the
i
won
t
do
it
miss
jeremy
has
read
of
something
of
that
sort
or
heard
of
it
and
stored
it
in
her
subconscious
but
he
glanced
up
at
the
ceiling
nevertheless
and
a
moment
later
had
drawn
up
a
chair
and
stepped
onto
it
and
i
did
the
same
thing
we
presented
i
imagine
rather
a
strange
picture
and
i
know
that
the
presence
of
the
rigid
figure
on
the
couch
gave
me
a
sort
of
ghoulish
feeling
the
house
was
an
old
one
and
in
the
center
of
the
high
ceiling
a
plaster
ornament
surrounded
the
chandelier
our
search
gradually
centered
on
this
ornament
but
the
chairs
were
low
and
our
examination
revealed
nothing
it
was
at
that
time
too
that
we
heard
some
one
in
the
lower
hall
and
we
had
only
a
moment
to
put
our
chairs
in
place
before
the
butler
came
in
he
showed
no
surprise
but
stood
looking
at
the
body
on
the
couch
his
thin
face
working
i
met
the
detectives
outside
doctor
he
said
it
s
a
terrible
thing
sir
a
terrible
i
d
keep
the
other
servants
out
of
this
room
yes
he
went
over
to
the
sheet
lifted
the
edge
slowly
and
then
replaced
it
and
to
the
door
the
others
are
not
back
yet
i
ll
admit
them
and
get
them
up
quietly
how
is
wells
sleeping
sperry
said
briefly
and
hawkins
went
out
i
realize
now
that
sperry
was
i
am
sure
he
will
forgive
this
in
a
state
of
nerves
that
night
for
example
he
returned
only
an
impatient
silence
to
my
doubt
as
to
whether
hawkins
had
really
only
just
returned
and
he
quite
missed
something
downstairs
which
i
later
proved
to
have
an
important
bearing
on
the
case
this
was
when
we
were
going
out
and
after
hawkins
had
opened
the
front
door
for
us
it
had
been
freezing
hard
and
sperry
who
has
a
bad
ankle
looked
about
for
a
walking
stick
he
found
one
and
i
saw
hawkins
take
a
swift
step
forward
and
then
stop
with
no
expression
whatever
in
his
face
this
will
answer
yes
sir
said
hawkins
impassively
and
if
i
realize
that
sperry
was
nervous
that
night
i
also
realize
that
he
was
fighting
a
battle
quite
his
own
and
with
its
personal
problems
she
s
got
to
quit
this
sort
of
thing
he
said
savagely
and
apropos
of
nothing
as
we
walked
along
it
s
hard
on
her
and
besides
yes
she
couldn
t
have
learned
about
it
he
said
following
his
own
trail
of
thought
my
car
brought
her
from
her
home
to
the
she
was
brought
in
to
us
at
once
but
don
t
you
see
that
if
there
are
other
developments
to
prove
her
statements
she
well
she
s
as
innocent
as
a
child
but
take
herbert
for
instance
do
you
suppose
he
ll
believe
she
had
no
outside
information
but
it
was
happening
while
we
were
shut
in
the
so
elinor
claims
but
if
there
was
anything
to
hide
it
would
have
taken
time
an
hour
or
so
perhaps
you
can
see
how
herbert
would
jump
on
we
went
back
i
remember
to
speaking
of
the
seance
itself
and
to
the
safer
subject
of
the
physical
phenomena
as
i
have
said
we
did
not
then
know
of
those
experimenters
who
claim
that
the
medium
can
evoke
rods
of
energy
and
that
by
its
means
the
invisible
controls
can
perform
their
strange
feats
of
levitation
and
the
movement
of
solid
bodies
sperry
touched
very
lightly
on
the
spirit
side
at
least
it
would
mean
activity
he
said
the
thought
of
an
inert
eternity
is
not
he
was
inclined
however
to
believe
that
there
were
laws
of
which
we
were
still
in
ignorance
and
that
we
might
some
day
find
and
use
the
fourth
dimension
he
seemed
to
be
able
to
grasp
it
quite
clearly
the
cube
of
the
cube
or
hypercube
he
explained
or
get
it
this
way
a
cone
passed
through
a
i
know
i
said
that
it
is
perfectly
simple
but
somehow
it
just
sounds
like
words
to
it
s
perfectly
clear
horace
he
insisted
but
remember
this
when
you
try
to
work
it
out
it
is
necessary
to
use
motion
as
a
translator
of
time
into
space
or
of
space
into
i
don
t
intend
to
work
it
out
i
said
irritably
but
i
mean
to
use
motion
as
a
translator
of
the
time
which
is
in
the
morning
to
take
me
to
a
certain
space
which
is
where
i
but
as
it
happened
i
did
not
go
into
my
house
when
i
reached
it
i
was
wide
awake
and
i
perceived
on
looking
up
at
my
wife
s
windows
that
the
lights
were
out
as
it
is
her
custom
to
wait
up
for
me
on
those
rare
occasions
when
i
spend
an
evening
away
from
home
i
surmised
that
she
was
comfortably
asleep
and
made
my
way
to
the
pharmacy
to
which
the
wellses
governess
had
referred
the
was
in
the
behind
the
shop
he
had
fixed
himself
comfortably
on
two
chairs
with
an
old
over
his
knee
and
a
bottle
of
sarsaparilla
on
a
wooden
box
beside
him
he
did
not
waken
until
i
spoke
to
him
sorry
to
rouse
you
jim
i
said
he
flung
off
the
cover
and
jumped
up
upsetting
the
bottle
which
trickled
a
stale
stream
to
the
floor
oh
that
s
all
right
johnson
i
wasn
t
asleep
i
let
that
go
and
went
at
once
to
the
object
of
our
visit
yes
he
remembered
the
governess
knew
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
wellses
bought
a
good
many
things
there
asked
as
to
her
telephoning
he
thought
it
was
about
nine
o
clock
maybe
earlier
but
questioned
as
to
what
she
had
telephoned
about
he
drew
himself
up
oh
see
here
he
said
i
can
t
very
well
tell
you
that
can
i
this
business
has
got
ethics
all
sorts
of
he
enlarged
on
that
the
secrets
of
the
city
he
maintained
loftily
were
in
the
hands
of
the
pharmacies
it
was
a
trust
that
they
kept
every
trouble
from
dope
to
drink
and
then
some
he
boasted
when
i
told
him
that
arthur
wells
was
dead
his
jaw
dropped
but
there
was
no
more
argument
in
him
he
knew
very
well
the
number
the
governess
had
called
she
s
done
it
several
times
he
said
i
ll
be
frank
with
you
i
got
curious
after
the
third
evening
and
called
it
myself
you
know
the
trick
i
found
out
it
was
the
ellingham
house
up
state
what
was
the
nature
of
the
conversations
oh
she
was
very
careful
it
s
an
open
phone
and
any
one
could
hear
her
once
she
said
somebody
was
not
to
come
another
time
she
just
said
this
is
suzanne
gautier
and
tonight
that
the
family
was
going
out
not
to
when
i
told
him
it
was
a
case
of
suicide
his
jaw
dropped
can
you
beat
it
he
said
i
ask
you
can
you
beat
it
a
fellow
who
had
everything
but
he
was
philosophical
too
a
lot
of
people
get
the
bug
once
in
a
while
he
said
they
come
in
here
for
a
dose
of
sudden
death
and
it
takes
watching
you
d
be
surprised
the
number
of
things
that
will
do
the
trick
if
you
take
enough
i
don
t
know
if
things
get
to
breaking
wrong
his
voice
trailed
off
and
he
kicked
at
the
old
table
cover
on
the
floor
it
s
a
matter
of
the
point
of
view
he
said
more
cheerfully
and
my
point
of
view
just
now
is
that
this
place
is
darned
cold
and
so
s
the
street
you
d
better
have
a
little
something
to
warm
you
up
before
you
go
out
i
was
chilled
through
to
tell
the
truth
and
although
i
rarely
drink
anything
i
went
back
with
him
and
took
an
ounce
or
two
of
villainous
whiskey
poured
out
of
a
jug
into
a
graduated
glass
it
is
with
deep
humiliation
of
spirit
i
record
that
a
housemaid
coming
into
my
library
at
seven
o
clock
the
next
morning
found
me
in
top
hat
and
overcoat
asleep
on
the
library
couch
i
had
however
removed
my
collar
and
tie
and
my
watch
carefully
wound
was
on
the
beside
me
the
death
of
arthur
wells
had
taken
place
on
monday
evening
tuesday
brought
nothing
new
the
coroner
was
apparently
satisfied
and
on
wednesday
the
dead
man
s
body
was
cremated
thus
obliterating
all
evidence
sperry
said
with
what
i
felt
was
a
note
of
relief
but
i
think
the
situation
was
bothering
him
and
that
he
hoped
to
discount
in
advance
the
second
sitting
by
miss
jeremy
which
dane
had
already
arranged
for
the
following
monday
for
on
wednesday
afternoon
following
a
conversation
over
the
telephone
sperry
and
i
had
a
private
sitting
with
miss
jeremy
in
sperry
s
private
office
i
took
my
wife
into
our
confidence
and
invited
her
to
be
present
but
the
unfortunate
coldness
following
the
housemaid
s
discovery
of
me
asleep
in
the
library
on
the
morning
after
the
murder
was
still
noticeable
and
she
refused
the
sitting
however
was
totally
without
value
there
was
difficulty
on
the
medium
s
part
in
securing
the
trance
condition
and
she
broke
out
once
rather
petulantly
with
the
remark
that
we
were
interfering
with
her
in
some
way
i
noticed
that
sperry
had
placed
arthur
wells
s
stick
unobtrusively
on
his
table
but
we
secured
only
rambling
and
replies
to
our
questions
and
whether
it
was
because
i
knew
that
outside
it
was
broad
day
or
because
the
wells
matter
did
not
come
up
at
all
i
found
a
total
lack
of
that
sense
of
the
unknown
which
made
all
the
evening
sittings
so
grisly
i
am
sure
she
knew
we
had
wanted
something
and
that
she
had
failed
to
give
it
to
us
for
when
she
came
out
she
was
depressed
and
in
a
state
of
lowered
vitality
i
m
afraid
i
m
not
helping
you
she
said
i
m
a
little
tired
i
she
was
tired
i
felt
suddenly
very
sorry
for
her
she
was
so
pretty
and
so
young
only
or
thereabouts
to
be
in
the
grip
of
forces
so
relentless
sperry
sent
her
home
in
his
car
and
took
to
pacing
the
floor
of
his
office
i
m
going
to
give
it
up
horace
he
said
perhaps
you
are
right
we
may
be
on
the
verge
of
some
real
discovery
but
while
i
m
interested
so
interested
that
it
interferes
with
my
work
i
m
frankly
afraid
to
go
on
there
are
several
i
argued
with
him
there
could
be
no
question
that
if
things
were
left
as
they
were
a
number
of
people
would
go
through
life
convinced
that
elinor
wells
had
murdered
her
husband
look
at
the
situation
she
had
sent
out
all
the
servants
and
the
governess
surely
an
unusual
thing
in
an
establishment
of
that
sort
and
miss
jeremy
had
been
vindicated
in
three
points
some
stains
had
certainly
been
washed
up
we
had
found
the
key
where
she
had
stated
it
to
be
and
arthur
had
certainly
been
shaving
himself
in
other
words
i
argued
we
can
t
stop
sperry
you
can
t
stop
but
my
idea
would
be
that
our
investigations
be
purely
scientific
and
not
also
in
other
words
he
said
you
think
we
will
discover
something
so
you
suggest
that
we
compound
a
felony
and
keep
it
to
ourselves
exactly
i
said
drily
it
is
of
course
possible
that
my
nerves
were
somewhat
unstrung
during
the
days
that
followed
i
wakened
one
night
to
a
terrific
thump
which
shook
my
bed
and
which
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
some
one
having
struck
the
with
a
plank
immediately
following
this
came
a
sharp
knocking
on
the
antique
which
hangs
beside
my
fireplace
when
i
had
sufficiently
recovered
my
i
turned
on
my
bedside
lamp
but
the
room
was
empty
again
i
wakened
with
a
feeling
of
intense
cold
i
was
frozen
with
it
and
curiously
enough
it
was
an
inner
cold
it
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
surface
of
my
body
i
have
no
explanation
to
make
of
these
phenomena
like
the
occurrences
at
the
seance
they
were
and
that
was
all
but
on
thursday
night
of
that
week
my
wife
came
into
my
bedroom
and
stated
flatly
that
there
were
burglars
in
the
house
now
it
has
been
my
contention
always
that
if
a
burglar
gains
entrance
he
should
be
allowed
to
take
what
he
wants
silver
can
be
replaced
but
as
i
said
to
my
wife
then
horace
johnson
could
not
but
she
had
recently
acquired
a
tea
set
formerly
belonging
to
her
and
apprehension
regarding
it
made
her
for
the
nonce
less
solicitous
for
me
than
usual
either
you
go
or
i
go
she
said
where
s
your
revolver
i
got
out
of
bed
at
that
and
went
down
the
stairs
but
i
must
confess
that
i
felt
the
moment
darkness
surrounded
me
considerably
less
trepidation
concerning
the
possible
burglar
than
i
felt
as
to
the
darkness
itself
johnson
had
locked
herself
in
my
bedroom
and
there
was
something
horrible
in
the
black
depths
of
the
lower
hall
we
are
people
and
have
not
yet
adopted
electric
light
i
carried
a
box
of
matches
but
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
one
i
had
lighted
went
out
i
was
terrified
i
tried
to
light
another
match
but
there
was
a
draft
from
somewhere
and
it
too
was
extinguished
before
i
had
had
time
to
glance
about
i
was
immediately
conscious
of
a
sort
of
soft
movement
around
me
as
of
shadowy
shapes
that
passed
and
repassed
once
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
hand
was
laid
on
my
shoulder
and
was
not
lifted
but
instead
dissolved
into
the
other
shadows
around
the
sudden
striking
of
the
clock
on
the
stair
landing
completed
my
demoralization
i
turned
and
fled
upstairs
pursued
to
my
agonized
nerves
by
ghostly
hands
that
came
toward
me
from
between
the
spindles
of
the
at
dawn
i
went
downstairs
again
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
i
found
that
a
door
to
the
basement
had
been
left
open
and
that
the
soft
movement
had
probably
been
my
overcoat
swaying
in
the
draft
probably
i
was
not
certain
indeed
i
was
certain
of
nothing
during
those
strange
days
i
had
built
up
for
myself
a
universe
upheld
by
certain
laws
of
day
and
night
of
food
and
sleep
and
movement
of
three
dimensions
of
space
and
now
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
stood
all
my
life
but
on
the
threshold
and
for
an
hour
or
so
the
door
had
opened
sperry
had
i
believe
told
herbert
robinson
of
what
we
had
discovered
but
nothing
had
been
said
to
the
women
i
knew
through
my
wife
that
they
were
wildly
curious
and
the
night
of
the
second
seance
dane
drew
me
aside
and
i
saw
that
she
suspected
without
knowing
that
we
had
been
endeavoring
to
check
up
our
revelations
with
the
facts
i
want
you
to
promise
me
one
thing
she
said
i
ll
not
bother
you
now
but
i
m
an
old
woman
with
not
much
more
of
life
to
be
influenced
by
any
disclosures
when
this
thing
is
over
and
you
have
come
to
a
conclusion
i
ll
not
put
it
that
way
you
may
not
come
to
a
conclusion
but
when
it
is
over
i
want
you
to
tell
me
the
whole
story
will
you
i
promised
that
i
would
miss
jeremy
did
not
come
to
dinner
she
never
ate
before
a
seance
and
although
we
tried
to
keep
the
conversational
ball
floating
airily
there
was
not
the
usual
effervescence
of
the
neighborhood
club
dinners
one
and
all
we
were
waiting
we
knew
not
for
what
i
am
sorry
to
record
that
there
were
no
physical
phenomena
of
any
sort
at
this
second
seance
the
room
was
arranged
as
it
had
been
at
the
first
sitting
except
that
a
table
with
a
candle
and
a
chair
had
been
placed
behind
a
screen
for
dane
s
secretary
there
was
one
other
change
sperry
had
brought
the
he
had
taken
from
arthur
wells
s
room
and
after
the
medium
was
in
trance
he
placed
it
on
the
table
before
her
the
first
questions
were
disappointing
in
results
asked
about
the
stick
there
was
only
silence
when
however
sperry
went
back
to
the
sitting
of
the
week
before
and
referred
to
questions
and
answers
at
that
time
the
medium
seemed
uneasy
her
hand
held
under
mine
made
an
effort
to
free
itself
and
released
touched
the
cane
she
lifted
it
and
struck
the
table
a
hard
blow
with
it
do
you
know
to
whom
that
stick
belongs
a
silence
then
will
you
tell
us
what
you
know
about
it
it
is
writing
it
was
writing
but
the
water
washed
it
then
instantly
and
with
great
rapidity
followed
a
wild
torrent
of
words
and
incomplete
sentences
it
is
inarticulate
and
the
secretary
made
no
record
of
it
as
i
recall
however
it
was
about
water
children
and
the
words
ten
o
clock
repeated
several
times
do
you
mean
that
something
happened
at
ten
o
clock
no
certainly
not
no
indeed
the
water
washed
it
away
all
of
it
not
a
where
did
all
this
happen
she
named
without
hesitation
a
seaside
resort
about
fifty
miles
from
our
city
there
was
not
one
of
us
i
dare
say
who
did
not
know
that
the
wellses
had
spent
the
preceding
summer
there
and
that
charlie
ellingham
had
been
there
also
do
you
know
that
arthur
wells
is
dead
yes
he
is
did
he
kill
himself
you
can
t
catch
me
on
that
i
don
t
here
the
medium
laughed
it
was
horrible
and
the
laughter
made
the
whole
thing
absurd
but
it
died
away
quickly
if
only
the
pocketbook
was
not
lost
she
said
there
were
so
many
things
in
it
especially
walking
is
a
dane
s
secretary
suddenly
spoke
do
you
want
me
to
take
things
like
that
she
asked
take
everything
please
was
the
answer
and
letters
it
will
be
terrible
if
the
letters
are
where
was
the
pocketbook
lost
sperry
asked
if
that
were
known
it
could
be
found
was
the
reply
rather
sharply
given
hawkins
may
have
it
he
was
always
hanging
around
the
curtain
was
much
what
curtain
nobody
would
have
thought
of
the
curtain
first
ideas
are
she
repeated
this
following
it
as
once
before
with
rhymes
for
the
final
word
best
rest
chest
pest
pest
she
said
that
s
hawkins
and
again
the
laughter
did
one
of
the
bullets
strike
the
ceiling
yes
but
you
ll
never
find
it
it
is
holding
well
that
part
s
safe
enough
unless
it
made
a
hole
in
the
floor
but
there
was
only
one
empty
chamber
in
the
revolver
how
could
two
shots
have
been
fired
there
was
no
answer
at
all
to
this
and
sperry
after
waiting
went
on
to
his
next
question
who
occupied
the
room
overhead
but
here
we
received
the
reply
to
the
previous
question
there
was
a
box
of
cartridges
in
the
that
s
from
that
point
however
the
interest
lapsed
either
there
was
no
answer
to
questions
or
we
got
the
absurdity
that
we
had
encountered
before
about
the
furniture
but
unsatisfactory
in
many
ways
as
the
seance
had
been
the
effect
on
miss
jeremy
was
profound
she
was
longer
in
coming
out
and
greatly
exhausted
when
it
was
all
over
she
refused
to
take
the
supper
dane
had
prepared
for
her
and
at
eleven
o
clock
sperry
took
her
home
in
his
car
i
remember
that
dane
inquired
after
she
had
gone
does
any
one
know
the
name
of
the
wellses
butler
is
it
hawkins
i
said
nothing
and
as
sperry
was
the
only
one
likely
to
know
and
he
had
gone
the
inquiry
went
no
further
looking
back
i
realize
that
herbert
while
less
cynical
was
still
skeptical
that
his
sister
was
but
for
some
reason
watching
me
and
that
dane
was
in
a
state
of
delightful
anticipation
my
wife
however
had
taken
a
dislike
to
miss
jeremy
and
said
that
the
whole
thing
bored
her
the
men
like
it
of
course
she
said
horace
fairly
simpers
with
pleasure
while
he
sits
and
holds
her
hand
but
a
woman
doesn
t
impose
on
other
women
so
easily
it
s
my
dear
dane
said
reaching
over
and
patting
my
wife
s
hand
people
talked
that
way
about
columbus
and
galileo
and
if
it
is
nonsense
it
is
such
thrilling
nonsense
vi
i
find
that
the
solution
of
the
arthur
wells
mystery
for
we
did
solve
it
takes
three
divisions
in
my
mind
each
one
is
a
sitting
followed
by
an
investigation
made
by
sperry
and
myself
but
for
some
reason
after
miss
jeremy
s
second
sitting
i
found
that
my
reasoning
mind
was
stronger
than
my
credulity
and
as
sperry
had
at
that
time
determined
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
business
i
made
a
resolution
to
abandon
my
investigations
nor
have
i
any
reason
to
believe
that
i
would
have
altered
my
attitude
toward
the
case
had
it
not
been
that
i
saw
in
the
morning
paper
on
the
thursday
following
the
second
seance
that
elinor
wells
had
closed
her
house
and
gone
to
florida
i
tried
to
put
the
fact
out
of
my
mind
that
morning
after
all
what
good
would
it
do
no
discovery
of
mine
could
bring
arthur
wells
back
to
his
family
to
his
seat
at
the
bridge
table
at
the
club
to
his
too
expensive
cars
and
his
unpaid
bills
or
to
his
wife
who
was
not
grieving
for
him
on
the
other
hand
i
confess
to
an
overwhelming
desire
to
examine
again
the
ceiling
of
the
dressing
room
and
thus
to
check
up
one
degree
further
the
accuracy
of
our
revelations
after
some
debate
therefore
i
called
up
sperry
but
he
flatly
refused
to
go
on
any
further
miss
jeremy
has
been
ill
since
monday
he
said
mrs
dane
s
rheumatism
is
worse
her
companion
is
nervously
upset
and
your
own
wife
called
me
up
an
hour
ago
and
says
you
are
sleeping
with
a
light
and
she
thinks
you
ought
to
go
away
the
whole
club
is
shot
to
but
although
i
am
a
small
and
not
a
courageous
man
the
desire
to
examine
the
wells
house
clung
to
me
tenaciously
suppose
there
were
cartridges
in
his
table
drawer
suppose
i
should
find
the
second
bullet
hole
in
the
ceiling
i
no
longer
deceived
myself
by
any
argument
that
my
interest
was
purely
scientific
there
is
a
point
at
which
curiosity
becomes
unbearable
when
it
becomes
an
obsession
like
hunger
i
had
reached
that
point
nevertheless
i
found
it
hard
to
plan
the
necessary
deception
to
my
wife
my
habits
have
always
been
entirely
orderly
and
regular
my
wildest
dissipation
was
the
neighborhood
club
i
could
not
recall
an
evening
away
from
home
in
years
except
on
business
yet
now
i
must
have
a
free
evening
possibly
an
entire
night
in
planning
for
this
i
forgot
my
nervousness
for
a
time
i
decided
finally
to
tell
my
wife
that
an
client
wished
to
talk
business
with
me
and
that
day
at
luncheon
i
go
home
to
luncheon
i
mentioned
that
such
a
client
was
in
town
it
is
possible
i
said
as
easily
as
i
could
that
we
may
not
get
through
this
afternoon
if
things
should
run
over
into
the
evening
i
ll
she
took
it
calmly
enough
but
later
on
as
i
was
taking
an
electric
flash
from
the
drawer
of
the
hall
table
and
putting
it
in
my
overcoat
pocket
she
came
on
me
and
i
thought
she
looked
surprised
during
the
afternoon
i
was
beset
with
doubts
and
uneasiness
suppose
she
called
up
my
office
and
found
that
the
client
i
had
named
was
not
in
town
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
a
tangled
web
we
weave
when
first
we
practise
to
deceive
for
on
my
return
to
the
office
i
was
at
once
quite
certain
that
johnson
would
telephone
and
make
the
inquiry
after
some
debate
i
called
my
secretary
and
told
her
to
say
if
such
a
message
came
in
that
forbes
was
in
town
and
that
i
had
an
appointment
with
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
such
inquiry
came
in
but
as
miss
joyce
my
secretary
knew
that
forbes
was
in
europe
i
was
conscious
for
some
months
afterwards
that
miss
joyce
s
eyes
occasionally
rested
on
me
in
a
speculative
and
suspicious
manner
other
things
also
increased
my
uneasiness
as
the
day
wore
on
there
was
for
instance
the
matter
of
the
back
door
to
the
wells
house
nothing
was
more
unlikely
than
that
the
key
would
still
be
hanging
there
i
must
therefore
get
a
key
at
three
o
clock
i
sent
the
out
for
a
key
he
looked
so
surprised
that
i
explained
that
we
had
lost
our
key
and
that
i
required
an
assortment
of
keys
of
all
sizes
what
sort
of
key
he
demanded
eyeing
me
with
his
feet
apart
just
an
ordinary
key
i
said
not
a
yale
key
nothing
fancy
just
a
plain
at
something
after
four
my
wife
called
up
in
great
excitement
a
boy
and
a
man
had
been
to
the
house
and
had
fitted
an
extra
key
to
the
back
door
which
had
two
excellent
ones
already
she
was
quite
hysterical
and
had
sent
for
the
police
but
the
officer
had
arrived
after
they
had
gone
they
are
burglars
of
course
she
said
burglars
often
have
boys
with
them
to
go
through
the
pantry
windows
i
m
so
nervous
i
could
i
tried
to
tell
her
that
if
the
door
was
unlocked
there
was
no
need
to
use
the
pantry
window
but
she
rang
off
quickly
and
i
thought
coldly
not
however
before
she
had
said
that
my
plan
to
spend
the
evening
out
was
evidently
known
in
the
underworld
by
going
through
my
desk
i
found
a
number
of
keys
mostly
trunk
keys
and
one
the
key
to
a
but
late
in
the
afternoon
i
visited
a
client
of
mine
who
is
in
the
hardware
business
and
secured
quite
a
selection
one
of
them
was
a
skeleton
key
he
persisted
in
regarding
the
matter
as
a
joke
and
poked
me
between
the
as
i
went
out
if
you
re
arrested
with
all
that
hardware
on
you
he
said
you
ll
be
held
as
a
burglar
you
are
equipped
to
open
anything
from
a
can
of
tomatoes
to
the
missionary
box
in
but
i
felt
that
already
innocent
as
i
was
i
was
leaving
a
trail
of
suspicion
behind
me
miss
joyce
and
the
office
boy
the
dealer
and
my
wife
and
i
had
not
started
yet
i
dined
in
a
small
where
i
occasionally
lunch
and
took
a
large
cup
of
strong
black
coffee
when
i
went
out
into
the
night
again
i
found
that
a
heavy
fog
had
settled
down
and
i
began
to
feel
again
something
of
the
strange
and
disturbing
quality
of
the
day
which
had
ended
in
arthur
wells
s
death
already
a
potential
housebreaker
i
avoided
policemen
and
the
very
jingling
of
the
keys
in
my
pocket
sounded
loud
and
incriminating
to
my
ears
the
wells
house
was
dark
even
the
in
the
street
was
shrouded
in
fog
but
the
darkness
which
added
to
my
nervousness
added
also
to
my
security
i
turned
and
felt
my
way
cautiously
to
the
rear
of
the
house
suddenly
i
remembered
the
dog
but
of
course
he
was
gone
as
i
cautiously
ascended
the
steps
the
dead
leaves
on
the
vines
rattled
as
at
the
light
touch
of
a
hand
and
i
was
tempted
to
turn
and
run
i
do
not
like
deserted
houses
even
in
daylight
they
have
a
sinister
effect
on
me
they
seem
in
their
empty
spaces
to
have
held
and
recorded
all
that
has
happened
in
the
dusty
past
the
wells
house
that
night
looming
before
me
silent
and
mysterious
seemed
the
embodiment
of
all
the
deserted
houses
i
had
known
its
empty
and
unshuttered
windows
were
like
blind
eyes
gazing
in
not
out
nevertheless
now
that
the
time
had
come
a
certain
amount
of
courage
came
with
it
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
that
a
certain
part
of
it
came
from
the
anticipation
of
the
neighborhood
club
s
plaudits
for
herbert
to
have
made
such
an
investigation
or
even
sperry
with
his
height
and
his
iron
muscles
would
not
have
surprised
them
but
i
was
aware
that
while
they
expected
intelligence
and
even
humor
of
a
sort
from
me
they
did
not
anticipate
any
particular
bravery
the
flash
was
working
but
rather
feebly
i
found
the
nail
where
the
had
formerly
hung
but
the
key
as
i
had
expected
was
gone
i
was
less
than
five
minutes
i
fancy
in
finding
a
key
from
my
collection
that
would
fit
the
bolt
slid
back
with
a
click
and
the
door
opened
it
was
still
early
in
the
evening
or
thereabouts
i
tried
to
think
of
that
to
remember
that
only
a
few
blocks
away
some
of
my
friends
were
still
dining
or
making
their
way
into
theaters
but
the
silence
of
the
house
came
out
to
meet
me
on
the
threshold
and
its
blackness
enveloped
me
like
a
wave
it
was
unfortunate
too
that
i
remembered
just
then
that
it
was
or
soon
would
be
the
very
hour
of
young
wells
s
death
nevertheless
once
inside
the
house
the
door
to
the
outside
closed
and
facing
two
alternatives
to
go
on
with
it
or
to
cut
and
run
i
found
a
sort
of
desperate
courage
clenched
my
teeth
and
felt
for
the
nearest
light
switch
the
electric
light
had
been
cut
off
i
should
have
expected
it
but
i
had
not
i
remember
standing
in
the
back
hall
and
debating
whether
to
go
on
or
to
get
out
i
was
not
only
in
a
highly
nervous
state
but
i
was
also
badly
handicapped
however
as
the
moments
wore
on
and
i
stood
there
with
the
quiet
unbroken
by
no
mysterious
sounds
i
gained
a
certain
confidence
after
a
short
period
of
readjustment
therefore
i
felt
my
way
to
the
library
door
and
into
the
room
once
there
i
used
the
flash
to
discover
that
the
windows
were
shuttered
and
proceeded
to
take
off
my
hat
and
coat
which
i
placed
on
a
chair
near
the
door
it
was
at
this
time
that
i
discovered
that
the
battery
of
my
lamp
was
very
weak
and
finding
a
candle
in
a
tall
brass
stick
on
the
mantelpiece
i
lighted
it
then
i
looked
about
the
house
had
evidently
been
hastily
closed
some
of
the
furniture
was
covered
with
sheets
while
part
of
it
stood
unprotected
the
rug
had
been
folded
into
the
center
of
the
room
and
covered
with
heavy
brown
papers
and
i
was
extremely
startled
to
hear
the
papers
rustling
a
mouse
however
proved
to
be
the
source
of
the
sound
and
i
pulled
myself
together
with
a
jerk
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
i
had
left
my
hat
and
overcoat
on
a
chair
near
the
door
there
could
be
no
mistake
as
the
chair
was
a
light
one
and
the
weight
of
my
overcoat
threw
it
back
against
the
wall
candle
in
hand
i
stepped
out
into
the
hail
and
was
immediately
met
by
a
crash
which
reverberated
through
the
house
in
my
alarm
my
teeth
closed
on
the
end
of
my
tongue
with
agonizing
results
but
the
sound
died
away
and
i
concluded
that
an
upper
window
had
been
left
open
and
that
the
rising
wind
had
slammed
a
door
but
my
morale
as
we
say
since
the
war
had
been
shaken
and
i
recklessly
lighted
a
second
candle
and
placed
it
on
the
table
in
the
hall
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
to
facilitate
my
exit
in
case
i
desired
to
make
a
hurried
one
then
i
climbed
slowly
the
fog
had
apparently
made
its
way
into
the
house
for
when
halfway
up
i
turned
and
looked
down
the
candlelight
was
hardly
more
than
a
spark
surrounded
by
a
luminous
aura
i
do
not
know
exactly
when
i
began
to
feel
that
i
was
not
alone
in
the
house
it
was
i
think
when
i
was
on
a
chair
on
top
of
a
table
in
arthur
s
room
with
my
candle
upheld
to
the
ceiling
it
seemed
to
me
that
something
was
moving
stealthily
in
the
room
overhead
i
stood
there
candle
upheld
and
every
faculty
i
possessed
seemed
centered
in
my
ears
it
was
not
a
footstep
it
was
a
soft
and
dragging
movement
had
i
not
been
near
the
ceiling
i
should
not
have
heard
it
indeed
a
moment
later
i
was
not
certain
that
i
had
heard
it
my
chair
on
top
of
the
table
was
none
too
securely
balanced
i
had
found
what
i
was
looking
for
a
part
of
the
plaster
ornament
broken
away
and
replaced
by
a
whitish
substance
not
plaster
i
got
out
my
penknife
and
cut
away
the
foreign
matter
showing
a
small
hole
beneath
a
if
i
knew
anything
about
then
i
heard
the
dragging
movement
above
and
what
with
alarm
and
my
insecure
position
i
suddenly
overbalanced
chair
and
all
my
head
must
have
struck
on
the
corner
of
the
table
for
i
was
dazed
for
a
few
moments
the
candle
had
gone
out
of
course
i
felt
for
the
chair
righted
it
and
sat
down
i
was
dizzy
and
i
was
frightened
i
was
afraid
to
move
lest
the
dragging
thing
above
come
down
and
creep
over
me
in
the
darkness
and
smother
me
and
sitting
there
i
remembered
the
very
things
i
most
wished
to
forget
the
black
curtain
behind
miss
jeremy
the
things
flung
by
unseen
hands
into
the
room
the
way
my
watch
had
slid
over
the
table
and
fallen
to
the
floor
since
that
time
i
know
there
is
a
madness
of
courage
born
of
terror
nothing
could
be
more
intolerable
than
to
sit
there
and
wait
it
is
the
same
insanity
that
drove
men
out
of
the
trenches
to
the
charge
and
almost
certain
death
rather
than
to
sit
and
wait
for
what
might
come
in
a
way
i
daresay
i
charged
the
upper
floor
of
the
house
recalling
the
situation
from
this
safe
lapse
of
time
i
think
that
i
was
in
a
condition
close
to
frenzy
i
know
that
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
leap
down
the
staircase
and
escape
and
i
believe
now
this
was
due
to
a
conviction
that
i
was
dealing
with
the
supernatural
and
that
on
no
account
did
i
dare
to
turn
my
back
on
it
all
children
and
some
adults
i
am
sure
have
known
this
feeling
whatever
drove
me
i
know
that
candle
in
hand
and
hardly
sane
i
ran
up
the
staircase
and
into
the
room
overhead
it
was
empty
as
suddenly
as
my
sanity
had
gone
it
returned
to
me
the
sight
of
two
small
beds
side
by
side
a
tiny
a
row
of
toys
on
the
mantelpiece
was
calming
here
was
the
children
s
night
nursery
a
white
and
placid
room
which
could
house
nothing
hideous
i
was
humiliated
and
ashamed
i
horace
johnson
a
man
of
dignity
and
reputation
even
in
a
small
way
a
successful
speaker
numbering
years
of
logical
living
to
my
credit
had
been
running
toward
a
mythical
danger
from
which
i
had
been
afraid
to
run
away
i
sat
down
and
mopped
my
face
with
my
pocket
handkerchief
after
a
time
i
got
up
and
going
to
a
window
looked
down
at
the
quiet
world
below
the
fog
was
lifting
automobiles
were
making
cautious
progress
along
the
slippery
street
a
woman
with
a
basket
had
stopped
under
the
street
light
and
was
rearranging
her
parcels
the
clock
of
the
city
hall
visible
over
the
opposite
roofs
marked
only
twenty
minutes
to
nine
it
was
still
early
evening
not
even
midnight
the
magic
hour
of
the
night
somehow
that
fact
reassured
me
and
i
was
able
to
take
stock
of
my
surroundings
i
realized
for
instance
that
i
stood
in
the
room
over
arthur
s
dressing
room
and
that
it
was
into
the
ceiling
under
me
that
the
second
or
probably
the
first
bullet
had
penetrated
i
know
as
it
happens
very
little
of
firearms
but
i
did
realize
that
a
shot
from
colt
automatic
would
have
considerable
penetrative
power
to
be
exact
that
the
bullet
had
probably
either
lodged
itself
in
a
joist
or
had
penetrated
through
the
flooring
and
might
be
somewhere
over
my
head
but
my
candle
was
inadequate
for
more
than
the
most
superficial
examination
of
the
ceiling
which
presented
so
far
as
i
could
see
an
unbroken
surface
i
turned
my
attention
therefore
to
the
floor
it
was
when
i
was
turning
the
rug
back
that
i
recognized
the
natural
and
not
supernatural
origin
of
the
sound
which
had
so
startled
me
it
had
been
the
soft
movement
of
the
carpet
across
the
floor
boards
some
one
then
had
been
there
before
me
some
one
who
knew
what
i
knew
had
reasoned
as
i
reasoned
some
one
who
in
all
probability
still
lurked
on
the
upper
floor
obeying
an
impulse
i
stood
erect
and
called
out
sharply
sperry
i
said
sperry
there
was
no
answer
i
tried
again
calling
herbert
but
only
my
own
voice
came
back
to
me
and
the
whistling
of
the
wind
through
the
window
i
had
opened
my
fears
never
long
in
abeyance
that
night
roused
again
i
had
instantly
a
conviction
that
some
human
figure
sinister
and
dangerous
was
lurking
in
the
shadows
of
that
empty
floor
and
i
remember
backing
away
from
the
door
and
standing
in
the
center
of
the
room
prepared
for
some
stealthy
murderous
assault
when
none
came
i
looked
about
for
a
weapon
and
finally
took
the
only
thing
in
sight
a
from
the
fireplace
armed
with
that
i
made
a
cursory
round
of
the
rooms
but
there
was
no
one
hiding
in
them
i
went
back
to
the
rug
and
examined
the
floor
beneath
it
i
was
right
some
one
had
been
there
before
me
bits
of
splintered
wood
lay
about
the
second
bullet
had
been
fired
had
buried
itself
in
the
flooring
and
had
some
five
minutes
before
been
dug
out
vii
the
extraordinary
thing
about
the
arthur
wells
story
was
not
his
killing
for
killing
it
was
it
was
the
way
it
was
solved
here
was
a
young
woman
miss
jeremy
who
had
not
known
young
wells
had
not
known
his
wife
had
until
that
first
meeting
at
dane
s
never
met
any
member
of
the
neighborhood
club
yet
but
for
her
arthur
wells
would
have
gone
to
his
grave
bearing
the
stigma
of
moral
cowardice
of
suicide
the
solution
when
it
came
was
amazing
but
remarkably
simple
like
most
mysteries
i
have
in
my
own
house
for
instance
an
example
of
a
great
mystery
founded
on
mere
absentmindedness
this
is
what
my
wife
terms
the
mystery
of
the
i
had
left
the
wells
house
as
soon
as
i
had
made
the
discovery
in
the
night
nursery
i
carried
the
candle
and
the
downstairs
i
was
apparently
calm
but
watchful
i
would
have
said
that
i
had
never
been
more
calm
in
my
life
i
knew
quite
well
that
i
had
the
in
my
hand
just
when
i
ceased
to
be
cognizant
of
them
was
probably
when
on
entering
the
library
i
found
that
my
overcoat
had
disappeared
and
that
my
stiff
hat
badly
broken
lay
on
the
floor
however
as
i
say
i
was
still
extraordinarily
composed
i
picked
up
my
hat
and
moving
to
the
rear
door
went
out
and
closed
it
when
i
reached
the
street
however
i
had
only
gone
a
few
yards
when
i
discovered
that
i
was
still
carrying
the
lighted
candle
and
that
a
man
passing
by
had
stopped
and
was
staring
after
me
my
composure
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
i
dropped
the
candle
down
the
next
sewer
opening
but
the
fact
remains
that
i
carried
the
home
i
do
not
recall
doing
so
in
fact
i
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
until
morning
on
the
way
to
my
house
i
was
elaborating
a
story
to
the
effect
that
my
overcoat
had
been
stolen
from
a
restaurant
where
i
and
my
client
had
dined
the
hat
offered
more
serious
difficulties
i
fancied
that
by
kissing
my
wife
at
the
breakfast
table
i
might
be
able
to
get
out
without
her
following
me
to
the
front
door
which
is
her
custom
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
need
not
have
concerned
myself
about
the
hat
when
i
descended
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
i
found
her
surveying
the
in
the
hall
the
were
standing
there
gleaming
among
my
sticks
and
umbrellas
i
lied
i
lied
shamelessly
she
is
a
nervous
woman
and
as
we
have
no
children
her
attitude
toward
me
is
one
of
watchful
waiting
through
long
years
she
has
expected
me
to
commit
some
indiscretion
innocent
of
course
such
as
going
out
without
my
overcoat
on
a
cool
day
and
she
intends
to
be
on
hand
for
every
emergency
i
dared
not
confess
therefore
that
on
the
previous
evening
i
had
burglariously
entered
a
closed
house
had
there
surprised
another
intruder
at
work
had
fallen
and
bumped
my
head
severely
and
had
finally
had
my
overcoat
taken
horace
she
said
coldly
where
did
you
get
those
i
repeated
why
that
s
so
they
are
where
did
you
get
them
my
dear
i
expostulated
i
get
them
what
i
would
like
to
ask
she
said
with
an
icy
calmness
that
i
have
learned
to
dread
is
whether
you
carried
them
home
over
your
head
under
the
impression
that
you
had
your
certainly
not
i
said
with
dignity
i
assure
you
my
dear
i
am
not
a
curious
woman
she
put
in
incisively
but
when
my
husband
spends
an
evening
out
and
returns
minus
his
overcoat
with
his
hat
mashed
a
lump
the
size
of
an
egg
over
his
ear
and
puts
a
pair
of
in
the
umbrella
stand
under
the
impression
that
it
is
an
umbrella
i
have
a
right
to
ask
at
least
if
he
intends
to
continue
his
life
of
i
made
a
mistake
then
i
should
have
told
her
instead
i
took
my
broken
hat
and
jammed
it
on
my
head
with
a
force
that
made
the
lump
she
had
noticed
jump
like
a
toothache
and
went
out
when
at
noon
and
luncheon
i
tried
to
tell
her
the
truth
she
listened
to
the
end
then
i
should
think
you
could
have
done
better
than
that
she
said
you
have
had
all
morning
to
think
it
however
if
things
were
in
a
state
of
armed
neutrality
at
home
i
had
a
certain
compensation
for
them
when
i
told
my
story
to
sperry
that
afternoon
you
see
how
it
is
i
finished
you
can
stay
out
of
this
or
come
in
sperry
but
i
can
not
stop
now
he
was
murdered
beyond
a
doubt
and
there
is
an
intelligent
effort
being
made
to
eliminate
every
particle
of
he
nodded
it
looks
like
it
and
this
man
who
was
there
last
night
why
a
man
he
took
your
overcoat
instead
of
his
own
didn
t
he
it
may
have
been
it
s
curious
isn
t
it
that
we
ve
had
no
suggestion
of
ellingham
in
all
the
rest
of
the
like
the
other
members
of
the
neighborhood
club
he
had
a
copy
of
the
proceedings
at
the
two
seances
and
now
he
brought
them
out
and
fell
to
studying
them
she
was
right
about
the
bullet
in
the
ceiling
he
reflected
i
suppose
you
didn
t
look
for
the
box
of
shells
for
the
revolver
i
meant
to
but
it
slipped
my
he
shuffled
the
loose
pages
of
the
record
cane
washed
away
by
the
water
a
knee
that
is
hurt
the
curtain
would
have
been
safer
hawkins
the
furniture
is
all
over
the
house
that
last
horace
isn
t
pertinent
it
refers
clearly
to
the
room
we
were
in
of
course
the
point
is
how
much
of
the
rest
is
also
extraneous
matter
he
one
of
the
sheets
of
course
that
belongs
about
hawkins
and
probably
this
it
will
be
terrible
if
the
letters
are
they
were
in
the
pocketbook
he
folded
up
the
papers
and
replaced
them
in
a
drawer
we
d
better
go
back
to
the
house
he
said
whoever
took
your
overcoat
by
mistake
probably
left
one
the
difficulty
is
of
course
that
he
probably
discovered
his
error
and
went
back
again
last
night
confound
it
man
if
you
had
thought
of
that
at
the
time
we
would
have
something
to
go
on
if
i
had
thought
of
a
number
of
things
i
d
have
stayed
out
of
the
place
altogether
i
retorted
tartly
i
wish
you
could
help
me
about
the
sperry
i
don
t
seem
able
to
think
of
any
explanation
that
johnson
would
be
willing
to
tell
her
the
i
don
t
think
you
understand
i
explained
she
simply
wouldn
t
believe
it
and
if
she
did
i
should
have
to
agree
to
drop
the
investigation
as
a
matter
of
fact
sperry
i
had
resorted
to
subterfuge
in
order
to
remain
out
last
evening
and
i
am
bitterly
regretting
my
but
sperry
has
i
am
afraid
rather
loose
ideas
every
man
he
said
would
rather
tell
the
truth
but
every
woman
makes
it
necessary
to
lie
to
her
forget
the
horace
and
forget
johnson
he
may
not
have
dared
to
go
back
in
for
his
very
well
i
agreed
but
it
was
not
very
well
and
i
knew
it
i
felt
that
in
a
way
my
whole
domestic
happiness
was
at
stake
my
wife
is
a
difficult
person
to
argue
with
and
as
tenacious
of
an
opinion
once
formed
as
are
all
very
amiable
people
however
unfortunately
for
our
investigation
but
luckily
for
me
under
the
circumstances
sperry
was
called
to
another
city
that
afternoon
and
did
not
return
for
two
days
it
was
it
will
be
recalled
on
the
thursday
night
following
the
second
sitting
that
i
had
gone
alone
to
the
wells
house
and
my
interview
with
sperry
was
on
friday
it
was
on
friday
afternoon
that
i
received
a
telephone
message
from
dane
it
was
actually
from
her
secretary
the
clara
who
had
recorded
the
seances
it
was
dane
s
misfortune
to
be
almost
entirely
dependent
on
the
various
young
women
who
one
after
the
other
were
employed
to
look
after
her
i
say
one
after
the
other
advisedly
it
had
long
been
a
matter
of
jesting
in
the
neighborhood
club
that
dane
conducted
a
matrimonial
bureau
as
one
young
woman
after
another
was
married
from
her
house
it
was
her
kindly
habit
on
such
occasions
to
give
the
bride
a
wedding
and
only
a
month
before
it
had
been
my
privilege
to
give
away
in
holy
wedlock
miss
clara
s
predecessor
mrs
dane
would
like
you
to
stop
in
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
her
this
afternoon
johnson
said
the
secretary
at
what
time
at
four
o
i
hesitated
i
felt
that
my
wife
was
waiting
at
home
for
further
explanation
of
the
and
that
the
sooner
we
had
it
out
the
better
but
on
the
other
hand
dane
s
invitations
by
reason
of
her
infirmity
took
on
something
of
the
nature
of
commands
please
say
that
i
will
be
there
at
four
i
replied
i
bought
a
new
hat
that
afternoon
and
told
the
clerk
to
destroy
the
old
one
then
i
went
to
dane
s
she
was
in
the
now
restored
to
its
usual
clutter
of
furniture
and
ornaments
i
made
my
way
around
two
tables
stepped
over
a
hassock
and
under
the
leaves
of
an
artificial
palm
and
shook
her
hand
she
was
plainly
excited
never
have
i
known
a
woman
who
confined
to
a
lived
so
hard
she
did
not
allow
life
to
pass
her
windows
if
i
may
put
it
that
way
she
called
it
in
and
set
it
moving
about
her
chair
herself
the
nucleus
around
which
were
enacted
all
sorts
of
small
neighborhood
dramas
and
romances
her
secretaries
did
not
marry
she
married
them
it
is
curious
to
look
back
and
remember
how
herbert
and
sperry
and
myself
had
ignored
this
quality
in
her
in
the
wells
case
she
was
not
to
be
ignored
as
i
discovered
that
afternoon
sit
down
she
said
you
look
half
sick
nothing
escapes
her
eyes
so
i
was
careful
to
place
myself
with
the
lump
on
my
head
turned
away
from
her
but
i
fancy
she
saw
it
for
her
eyes
twinkled
horace
horace
she
said
how
i
have
detested
you
all
week
i
you
detested
me
loathed
you
she
said
with
unction
you
are
cruel
and
ungrateful
herbert
has
influenza
and
does
not
count
and
sperry
is
in
love
oh
yes
i
know
it
i
know
a
great
many
things
but
you
i
could
only
stare
at
her
the
strange
thing
is
she
went
on
that
i
have
known
you
for
years
and
never
suspected
your
sense
of
humor
you
ll
forgive
me
i
know
if
i
tell
you
that
your
lack
of
humor
was
to
my
mind
the
only
flaw
in
an
otherwise
perfect
i
am
not
aware
i
began
stiffly
i
have
always
believed
that
i
furnished
to
the
neighborhood
club
its
only
leaven
of
don
t
spoil
it
she
begged
don
t
if
you
could
know
how
i
have
enjoyed
it
all
afternoon
i
have
been
chuckling
the
horace
the
then
i
knew
that
my
wife
had
been
to
dane
and
i
drew
a
long
breath
i
assure
you
i
said
gravely
that
while
doubtless
i
carried
the
wretched
things
home
and
er
placed
them
where
they
were
found
i
have
not
the
slightest
recollection
of
it
and
it
is
hardly
amusing
is
it
amusing
she
cried
it
s
delicious
it
has
made
me
a
young
woman
again
horace
if
i
could
have
seen
your
wife
s
face
when
she
found
them
i
would
give
cheerfully
almost
anything
i
but
underneath
her
mirth
i
knew
there
was
something
else
and
after
all
she
could
convince
my
wife
if
she
were
convinced
herself
i
told
the
whole
story
of
the
visit
sperry
and
i
had
made
the
night
arthur
wells
was
shot
and
of
what
we
discovered
of
the
clerk
at
the
pharmacy
and
his
statement
and
even
of
the
whiskey
and
its
unfortunate
effect
at
which
i
regret
to
say
she
was
vastly
amused
and
last
of
all
of
my
experience
the
previous
night
in
the
deserted
house
she
was
very
serious
when
i
finished
tea
came
but
we
forgot
to
drink
it
her
eyes
flashed
with
excitement
her
faded
face
flushed
and
with
it
all
as
i
look
back
there
was
an
air
of
suppressed
excitement
that
seemed
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
narrative
i
remembered
it
however
when
the
denouement
came
the
following
week
she
was
a
remarkable
woman
even
then
she
knew
or
strongly
suspected
the
thing
that
the
rest
of
us
had
missed
the
x
of
the
equation
but
i
think
it
only
fair
to
record
that
she
was
in
possession
of
facts
which
we
did
not
have
and
which
she
did
not
divulge
until
the
end
you
have
been
so
ungenerous
with
me
she
said
finally
that
i
am
tempted
not
to
tell
you
why
i
sent
for
you
of
course
i
know
i
am
only
a
helpless
old
woman
and
you
men
are
people
of
affairs
but
now
and
then
i
have
a
flash
of
intelligence
i
m
going
to
tell
you
but
you
don
t
deserve
she
went
down
into
the
black
silk
bag
at
her
side
which
was
as
much
a
part
of
her
attire
as
the
false
front
she
wore
with
such
careless
abandon
and
which
brown
in
color
and
indifferently
waved
was
invariably
parting
from
its
mooring
she
drew
out
a
newspaper
clipping
on
going
over
clara
s
notes
she
said
i
came
to
the
conclusion
last
tuesday
that
the
matter
of
the
missing
handbag
and
the
letters
was
important
more
important
probably
than
the
mere
record
shows
do
you
recall
the
note
of
distress
in
miss
jeremy
s
voice
it
was
almost
a
i
had
noticed
it
i
have
plenty
of
time
to
think
she
added
not
without
pathos
there
is
only
one
monday
night
in
the
week
and
the
days
are
long
it
occurred
to
me
to
try
to
trace
that
in
what
way
how
does
any
one
trace
lost
articles
she
demanded
by
advertising
of
course
last
wednesday
i
advertised
for
the
i
was
too
astonished
to
speak
i
reasoned
like
this
if
there
was
no
such
bag
there
was
no
harm
done
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
there
was
no
such
bag
the
chances
were
that
we
were
all
wrong
anyhow
if
there
was
such
a
bag
i
wanted
it
here
is
the
advertisement
as
i
inserted
she
gave
me
a
small
newspaper
cutting
lost
a
handbag
containing
private
letters
etc
liberal
reward
paid
for
its
return
please
write
to
a
the
daily
i
sat
with
it
on
my
palm
it
was
so
simple
so
direct
and
i
a
lawyer
and
presumably
reasonably
acute
had
not
thought
of
it
you
are
wasted
on
us
dane
i
acknowledged
well
i
see
something
has
come
of
yes
but
i
m
not
ready
for
she
dived
again
into
the
bag
and
brought
up
another
clipping
on
the
day
that
i
had
that
inserted
she
said
impressively
this
also
appeared
they
were
in
the
same
she
read
the
second
clipping
aloud
slowly
that
i
might
gain
all
its
significance
lost
on
the
night
of
monday
november
the
second
between
state
avenue
and
park
avenue
possibly
on
an
eastern
line
street
car
a
black
handbag
containing
keys
private
letters
and
a
small
sum
of
money
reward
and
no
questions
asked
if
returned
to
daily
news
she
passed
the
clipping
to
me
and
i
compared
the
two
it
looked
strange
and
i
confess
to
a
tingling
feeling
that
coincidence
that
element
so
much
to
be
feared
in
any
investigation
was
not
the
solution
here
but
there
was
such
a
chance
and
i
spoke
of
it
coincidence
rubbish
she
retorted
i
am
not
through
my
she
went
down
into
the
bag
again
and
i
expected
nothing
less
than
the
pocketbook
letters
and
all
to
appear
but
she
dragged
up
among
a
miscellany
of
handkerchiefs
a
bottle
of
and
a
few
almonds
of
which
she
was
inordinately
fond
an
envelope
yesterday
she
said
i
took
a
taxicab
ride
you
know
my
chair
gets
tiresome
occasionally
i
stopped
at
the
newspaper
office
and
found
the
bag
had
not
been
turned
in
but
that
there
was
a
letter
for
a
she
held
out
the
envelope
to
me
read
it
she
observed
it
is
a
curious
human
document
you
ll
probably
be
no
wiser
for
reading
it
but
it
shows
one
thing
we
are
on
the
track
of
i
have
the
letter
before
me
now
it
is
written
on
glazed
paper
ruled
with
blue
lines
the
writing
is
of
the
flowing
style
we
used
to
call
spencerian
and
if
it
lacks
character
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
its
weakness
is
merely
the
result
of
infrequent
use
of
a
pen
you
know
who
this
is
from
i
have
the
bag
and
the
letters
in
a
safe
place
if
you
would
treat
me
like
a
human
being
you
could
have
them
i
know
where
the
is
also
i
will
tell
you
this
i
have
no
wish
to
do
her
any
harm
she
will
have
to
pay
up
in
the
next
world
even
if
she
gets
off
in
this
the
way
i
reason
is
this
as
long
as
i
have
the
things
i
ve
got
the
whiphand
i
ve
got
you
too
although
you
may
think
i
haven
t
about
the
other
matter
i
was
innocent
i
swear
it
again
i
never
did
it
you
are
the
only
one
in
all
the
world
i
would
rather
be
dead
than
go
on
like
this
it
is
unsigned
i
stared
from
the
letter
to
dane
she
was
watching
me
her
face
grave
and
rather
sad
you
and
i
horace
she
said
live
our
orderly
lives
we
eat
and
sleep
and
talk
and
even
labor
we
think
we
are
living
but
for
the
last
day
or
two
i
have
been
seeing
visions
you
and
i
and
the
rest
of
us
living
on
the
surface
and
underneath
carefully
kept
down
so
it
will
not
make
us
uncomfortable
a
world
of
passion
and
crime
and
violence
and
suffering
that
letter
is
a
but
if
she
had
any
suspicion
then
as
to
the
writer
and
i
think
she
had
not
she
said
nothing
and
soon
after
i
started
for
home
i
knew
that
one
of
two
things
would
have
happened
there
either
my
wife
would
have
put
away
the
which
would
indicate
a
truce
or
they
would
remain
as
they
had
been
which
would
indicate
that
she
still
waited
for
the
explanation
i
could
not
give
it
was
with
a
certain
tension
therefore
that
i
opened
my
front
door
the
still
stood
in
the
stand
in
one
way
however
johnson
s
refusal
to
speak
to
me
that
evening
had
a
certain
value
for
it
enabled
me
to
leave
the
house
without
explanation
and
thus
to
discover
that
if
an
overcoat
had
been
left
in
place
of
my
own
it
had
been
taken
away
it
also
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
return
the
a
proceeding
which
i
had
considered
would
assist
in
a
return
of
the
entente
cordiale
at
home
but
which
most
unjustly
appeared
to
have
exactly
the
opposite
effect
it
has
been
my
experience
that
the
most
innocent
action
may
under
certain
circumstances
assume
an
appearance
of
extreme
guilt
by
saturday
the
condition
of
affairs
between
my
wife
and
myself
remained
in
statu
quo
and
i
had
decided
on
a
bold
step
this
was
to
call
a
special
meeting
of
the
neighborhood
club
without
miss
jeremy
and
put
before
them
the
situation
as
it
stood
at
that
time
with
a
view
to
formulating
a
future
course
of
action
and
also
of
publicly
vindicating
myself
before
my
wife
in
deference
to
herbert
robinson
s
recent
attack
of
influenza
we
met
at
the
robinson
house
sperry
himself
wheeled
dane
over
and
made
a
speech
we
have
called
this
meeting
he
said
because
a
rather
singular
situation
has
developed
what
was
commenced
purely
as
an
interesting
experiment
has
gone
beyond
that
stage
we
find
ourselves
in
the
curious
position
of
taking
what
comes
very
close
to
being
a
part
in
a
domestic
tragedy
the
affair
is
made
more
delicate
by
the
fact
that
this
tragedy
involves
people
who
if
not
our
friends
at
least
are
very
well
known
to
us
the
purpose
of
this
meeting
to
be
brief
is
to
determine
whether
the
neighborhood
club
as
a
body
wishes
to
go
on
with
the
investigation
or
to
stop
where
we
he
paused
but
as
no
one
spoke
he
went
on
again
it
is
really
not
as
simple
as
that
he
said
to
stop
now
in
view
of
the
evidence
we
intend
to
place
before
the
club
is
to
leave
in
all
our
minds
certain
suspicions
that
may
be
entirely
unjust
on
the
other
hand
to
go
on
is
very
possible
to
place
us
all
in
a
position
where
to
keep
silent
is
to
be
an
accessory
after
a
he
then
proceeded
in
orderly
fashion
to
review
the
first
sitting
and
its
results
he
read
from
notes
elaborating
them
as
he
went
along
for
the
benefit
of
the
women
who
had
not
been
fully
informed
as
all
the
data
of
the
club
is
now
in
my
possession
i
copy
these
notes
i
shall
review
briefly
the
first
sitting
and
what
followed
he
read
the
notes
of
the
sitting
first
you
will
notice
that
i
have
made
no
comment
on
the
physical
phenomena
which
occurred
early
in
the
seance
this
is
for
two
reasons
first
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
question
at
issue
second
it
has
no
quality
of
novelty
certain
people
under
certain
conditions
are
able
to
exert
powers
that
we
can
not
explain
i
have
no
belief
whatever
in
their
spiritistic
quality
they
are
purely
physical
the
exercise
of
powers
we
have
either
not
yet
risen
high
enough
in
our
scale
of
development
to
recognize
generally
or
which
have
survived
from
some
early
period
when
our
natural
gifts
had
not
been
smothered
by
and
to
make
our
position
clear
that
is
today
the
attitude
of
the
neighborhood
club
the
supernormal
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
not
the
supernatural
is
our
explanation
sperry
s
notes
were
alphabetical
a
at
or
somewhat
earlier
on
monday
night
a
week
ago
arthur
wells
killed
himself
or
was
killed
at
on
that
same
evening
by
johnson
s
watch
consulted
at
the
time
miss
jeremy
had
described
such
a
crime
here
he
elaborated
repeating
the
medium
s
account
b
at
midnight
sperry
reaching
home
had
found
a
message
summoning
him
to
the
wells
house
the
message
had
been
left
at
he
had
telephoned
me
and
we
had
gone
together
arriving
at
approximately
c
we
had
been
unable
to
enter
and
recalling
the
medium
s
description
of
a
key
on
a
nail
among
the
vines
had
searched
for
and
found
such
a
key
and
had
admitted
ourselves
wells
a
governess
a
doctor
and
two
policemen
were
in
the
house
the
dead
man
lay
in
the
room
in
which
he
had
died
here
he
went
at
length
into
the
condition
of
the
room
the
revolver
with
one
chamber
empty
and
the
sponge
and
razorstrop
behind
the
bathtub
we
had
made
a
hasty
examination
of
the
ceiling
but
had
found
no
trace
of
a
second
shot
d
the
governess
had
come
in
at
just
after
the
death
horace
johnson
had
had
a
talk
with
her
she
had
left
the
front
door
unfastened
when
she
went
out
at
eight
o
clock
she
said
she
had
gone
out
to
telephone
about
another
position
as
she
was
dissatisfied
she
had
phoned
from
elliott
s
pharmacy
on
state
avenue
later
that
night
johnson
had
gone
to
elliott
s
she
had
lied
about
the
message
she
had
really
telephoned
to
a
number
which
the
pharmacy
clerk
had
already
discovered
was
that
of
the
ellingham
house
the
message
was
that
ellingham
was
not
to
come
as
and
wells
were
going
out
it
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
telephoned
to
that
number
there
was
a
stir
in
the
room
something
which
we
had
tacitly
avoided
had
come
suddenly
into
the
open
sperry
raised
his
hand
it
is
necessary
to
be
explicit
he
said
that
the
club
may
see
where
it
stands
it
is
of
course
not
necessary
to
remind
ourselves
that
this
evening
s
disclosures
are
of
the
most
secret
nature
i
urge
that
the
club
jump
to
no
hasty
conclusions
and
that
there
shall
be
no
interruptions
until
we
have
finished
with
our
e
at
a
private
seance
which
johnson
and
i
decided
was
excusable
under
the
circumstances
the
medium
was
unable
to
give
us
anything
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
had
taken
with
us
a
belonging
to
the
dead
man
f
the
second
sitting
of
the
club
i
need
only
refresh
your
minds
as
to
one
or
two
things
the
medium
spoke
of
a
lost
pocketbook
and
of
letters
while
the
point
is
at
least
capable
of
doubt
apparently
the
letters
were
in
the
pocketbook
also
she
said
that
a
curtain
would
have
been
better
that
hawkins
was
a
nuisance
and
that
everything
was
all
right
unless
the
bullet
had
made
a
hole
in
the
floor
above
you
will
also
recall
the
mention
of
a
box
of
cartridges
in
a
table
drawer
in
arthur
wells
s
room
i
will
now
ask
horace
johnson
to
tell
what
occurred
on
the
night
before
last
thursday
i
do
not
think
horace
has
a
very
clear
recollection
of
last
thursday
night
my
wife
said
coldly
and
i
wish
to
go
on
record
at
once
that
if
he
claims
that
spirits
broke
his
hat
stole
his
overcoat
bumped
his
head
and
sent
him
home
with
a
pair
of
for
a
i
don
t
believe
which
attitude
herbert
i
regret
to
say
did
not
help
when
he
said
don
t
worry
horace
will
soon
be
too
old
for
the
gay
life
remember
your
arteries
i
have
quoted
this
interruption
to
show
how
little
outside
of
sperry
dane
and
myself
the
neighborhood
club
appreciated
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
herbert
for
instance
had
been
greatly
amused
when
sperry
spoke
of
my
finding
the
razorstrop
and
had
almost
chuckled
over
our
investigation
of
the
ceiling
but
they
were
very
serious
when
i
had
finished
my
statement
great
scott
herbert
said
then
she
was
right
after
all
i
say
i
guess
i
ve
been
no
end
of
an
i
was
inclined
to
agree
with
him
but
the
real
effect
of
my
brief
speech
was
on
my
wife
it
was
a
real
compensation
for
that
night
of
terror
and
for
the
uncomfortable
time
since
to
find
her
gaze
no
longer
cold
but
sympathetic
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
admiring
when
at
last
i
sat
down
beside
her
she
put
her
hand
on
my
arm
in
a
way
that
i
had
missed
since
the
unfortunate
affair
of
the
pharmacy
whiskey
dane
then
read
and
explained
the
two
clippings
and
the
letter
and
the
situation
so
far
as
it
had
developed
was
before
the
club
were
we
to
go
on
or
to
stop
put
to
a
vote
the
women
were
for
going
on
the
men
were
more
doubtful
and
herbert
voiced
what
i
think
we
all
felt
we
re
getting
in
pretty
deep
he
said
we
have
no
right
to
step
in
where
the
law
has
stepped
out
no
legal
right
that
is
as
to
moral
right
it
depends
on
what
we
are
holding
these
sittings
for
if
we
are
making
what
we
started
out
to
make
an
investigation
into
psychic
matters
then
we
can
go
on
but
with
this
proviso
i
think
whatever
may
come
of
it
the
result
is
of
psychic
interest
only
we
are
not
trailing
a
crime
is
the
affair
of
every
citizen
his
sister
put
in
concisely
but
the
general
view
was
that
herbert
was
right
i
am
not
defending
our
course
i
am
recording
it
it
is
i
admit
open
to
argument
having
decided
on
what
to
do
or
not
to
do
we
broke
into
animated
discussion
the
letter
to
a
was
the
rock
on
which
all
our
theories
foundered
that
and
the
message
the
governess
had
sent
to
charlie
ellingham
not
to
come
to
the
wells
house
that
night
by
no
stretch
of
rather
excited
imaginations
could
we
imagine
ellingham
writing
such
a
letter
who
had
written
the
letter
then
and
for
whom
was
it
meant
as
to
the
telephone
message
it
seemed
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
ellingham
s
having
gone
to
the
house
that
night
but
the
fact
remained
that
a
man
as
yet
unidentified
was
undoubtedly
concerned
in
the
case
had
written
the
letter
and
had
probably
been
in
the
wells
house
the
night
i
went
there
alone
in
the
end
we
decided
to
hold
one
more
seance
and
then
unless
the
further
developments
were
such
that
we
must
go
on
to
let
the
affair
drop
it
is
typical
of
the
strained
nervous
tension
which
had
developed
in
all
of
us
during
the
past
twelve
days
that
that
night
when
having
forgotten
to
let
the
dog
in
my
wife
and
i
were
roused
from
a
sound
sleep
by
his
howling
she
would
not
allow
me
to
go
down
and
admit
him
viii
on
sunday
i
went
to
church
i
felt
after
the
strange
phenomena
in
dane
s
and
after
the
contact
with
tragedy
to
which
they
had
led
that
i
must
hold
with
a
sort
of
desperation
to
the
traditions
and
beliefs
by
which
i
had
hitherto
regulated
my
conduct
and
the
church
did
me
good
between
the
immortality
it
taught
and
the
theory
of
spiritualism
as
we
had
seen
it
in
action
there
was
a
great
gulf
and
i
concluded
that
this
gulf
was
the
soul
the
conclusion
that
mind
and
certain
properties
of
mind
survived
was
not
enough
the
thought
of
a
disembodied
intelligence
was
pathetic
depressing
but
the
thought
of
a
glorified
soul
was
the
hope
of
the
world
my
wife
too
was
in
a
penitent
and
rather
exalted
mood
during
the
sermon
she
sat
with
her
hand
in
mine
and
i
was
conscious
of
peace
and
a
deep
thankfulness
we
had
been
married
for
many
years
and
we
had
grown
very
close
of
what
importance
was
the
wells
case
or
what
mattered
it
that
there
were
strange
laws
in
the
universe
so
long
as
we
kept
together
that
my
wife
had
felt
a
certain
bitterness
toward
miss
jeremy
a
jealousy
of
her
powers
even
of
her
youth
had
not
dawned
on
me
but
when
in
her
new
humility
she
suggested
that
we
call
on
the
medium
that
afternoon
i
realized
that
in
her
own
way
she
was
making
a
sort
of
atonement
miss
jeremy
lived
with
an
elderly
spinster
cousin
a
short
distance
out
of
town
it
was
a
grim
house
coldly
and
rigidly
calvinistic
it
gave
an
unpleasant
impression
at
the
start
and
our
comfort
was
not
increased
by
the
discovery
made
early
in
the
call
that
the
cousin
regarded
the
neighborhood
club
and
its
members
with
suspicion
the
cousin
her
name
was
connell
was
small
and
sharp
and
she
entered
the
room
followed
by
a
train
of
cats
all
the
time
she
was
frigidly
greeting
us
cats
were
coming
in
at
the
door
one
after
the
other
it
fascinated
me
i
do
not
like
cats
i
am
as
a
matter
of
confession
afraid
of
cats
they
affect
me
as
do
snakes
they
trailed
in
in
a
seemingly
endless
procession
and
one
of
them
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
leaped
from
behind
on
to
my
shoulder
the
shock
set
me
stammering
my
cousin
is
out
said
miss
connell
doctor
sperry
has
taken
her
for
a
ride
she
will
be
back
very
i
shook
a
cat
from
my
trouser
leg
and
my
wife
made
an
unimportant
remark
i
may
as
well
tell
you
i
disapprove
of
what
alice
is
doing
said
miss
connell
she
doesn
t
have
to
i
ve
offered
her
a
good
home
she
was
brought
up
a
presbyterian
i
call
this
sort
of
thing
playing
with
the
powers
of
darkness
only
the
eternally
damned
are
doomed
to
walk
the
earth
the
blessed
are
at
but
you
believe
in
her
powers
don
t
you
my
wife
asked
i
believe
she
can
do
extraordinary
things
she
saw
my
father
s
spirit
in
this
very
room
last
night
and
described
him
although
she
had
never
seen
as
she
had
said
that
only
the
eternally
damned
were
doomed
to
walk
the
earth
i
was
tempted
to
comment
on
this
stricture
on
her
departed
parent
but
a
large
cat
much
scarred
with
fighting
and
named
violet
insisted
at
that
moment
on
crawling
into
my
lap
and
my
attention
was
distracted
but
the
whole
thing
is
and
undignified
miss
connell
proceeded
in
her
cold
voice
come
violet
don
t
annoy
the
gentleman
i
have
other
visions
of
the
next
life
than
of
rapping
on
tables
and
chairs
and
throwing
small
articles
it
was
an
extraordinary
visit
even
the
arrival
of
miss
jeremy
herself
flushed
with
the
air
and
looking
singularly
normal
was
hardly
a
relief
sperry
who
followed
was
clearly
pleased
to
see
us
however
it
was
not
hard
to
see
how
things
were
with
him
he
helped
the
girl
out
of
her
wraps
with
a
manner
that
was
almost
proprietary
and
drew
a
chair
for
her
close
to
the
small
fire
which
hardly
affected
the
chill
of
the
room
with
their
entrance
a
spark
of
hospitality
seemed
to
kindle
in
the
cat
lady
s
breast
it
was
evident
that
she
liked
sperry
perhaps
she
saw
in
him
a
method
of
weaning
her
cousin
from
traffic
with
the
powers
of
darkness
she
said
something
about
tea
and
went
out
sperry
looked
across
at
the
girl
and
smiled
shall
i
tell
them
he
said
i
want
very
much
to
have
them
he
stood
up
and
with
that
unconscious
drama
which
actuates
a
man
at
a
crisis
in
his
affairs
he
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
this
young
lady
is
going
to
marry
me
he
said
we
are
very
happy
but
i
thought
he
eyed
us
anxiously
we
were
very
close
friends
and
he
wanted
our
approval
i
am
not
sure
if
we
were
wise
i
do
not
yet
know
but
something
of
the
new
understanding
between
my
wife
and
myself
must
have
found
its
way
to
our
voices
for
he
was
evidently
satisfied
then
that
s
all
right
he
said
heartily
and
my
wife
to
my
surprise
kissed
the
girl
except
for
the
cats
sitting
around
the
whole
thing
was
strangely
normal
and
yet
even
there
something
happened
that
set
me
to
thinking
afterward
not
that
it
was
strange
in
itself
but
that
it
seemed
never
possible
to
get
very
far
away
from
the
wells
mystery
tea
was
brought
in
by
hawkins
i
knew
him
immediately
but
he
did
not
at
once
see
me
he
was
evidently
accustomed
to
seeing
sperry
there
and
he
did
not
recognize
my
wife
but
when
he
had
put
down
the
tray
and
turned
to
pick
up
sperry
s
overcoat
to
carry
it
into
the
hall
he
saw
me
the
man
actually
started
i
can
not
say
that
he
changed
color
he
was
always
a
pale
individual
but
it
was
a
perceptible
instant
before
he
stooped
and
gathered
up
the
coat
sperry
turned
to
me
when
he
had
gone
out
that
was
hawkins
horace
he
said
you
remember
don
t
you
the
wellses
i
knew
him
at
he
wrote
to
me
asking
for
a
position
and
i
got
him
this
looks
sick
poor
devil
i
intend
to
have
a
go
at
his
how
long
has
he
been
here
more
than
a
week
i
as
i
drank
my
tea
i
pondered
after
all
the
neighborhood
club
must
guard
against
the
possibility
of
fraud
and
i
felt
that
sperry
had
been
indiscreet
to
say
the
least
from
the
time
of
hawkins
service
in
miss
jeremy
s
home
there
would
always
be
the
suspicion
of
collusion
between
them
i
did
not
believe
it
was
so
but
herbert
for
instance
would
be
inclined
to
suspect
her
suppose
that
hawkins
knew
about
the
crime
or
knew
something
and
surmised
the
rest
when
we
rose
to
go
sperry
drew
me
aside
you
think
i
ve
made
a
mistake
i
he
flung
away
with
an
impatient
gesture
then
came
back
to
me
now
look
here
he
said
i
know
what
you
mean
and
the
whole
idea
is
absurd
of
course
i
never
thought
about
it
but
even
allowing
for
connivance
which
i
don
t
for
a
moment
the
fellow
was
not
in
the
house
at
the
time
of
the
i
know
he
says
he
was
even
then
he
said
how
about
the
first
sitting
i
ll
swear
she
had
never
even
heard
of
him
the
fact
remains
that
his
presence
here
makes
us
all
do
you
want
me
to
throw
him
out
i
don
t
see
what
possible
good
that
will
do
i
was
uneasy
all
the
way
home
the
element
of
doubt
always
so
imminent
in
our
dealings
with
psychic
phenomena
had
me
by
the
throat
how
much
did
hawkins
know
was
there
any
way
without
going
to
the
police
to
find
if
he
had
really
been
out
of
the
wellses
house
that
night
now
almost
two
weeks
ago
when
arthur
wells
had
been
killed
that
evening
i
went
to
sperry
s
house
after
telephoning
that
i
was
coming
on
the
way
i
stopped
in
at
dane
s
and
secured
something
from
her
she
was
wildly
curious
and
made
me
promise
to
go
in
on
my
way
back
and
explain
i
made
a
compromise
i
will
come
in
if
i
have
anything
to
tell
you
i
said
but
i
knew
by
her
grim
smile
that
she
would
station
herself
by
her
window
and
that
i
would
stop
unless
i
made
a
detour
of
three
blocks
to
avoid
her
she
is
a
very
determined
woman
sperry
was
waiting
for
me
in
his
library
a
pleasant
room
which
i
have
often
envied
him
even
the
most
happily
married
man
wishes
now
and
then
for
some
quiet
dull
room
which
is
essentially
his
own
my
own
library
is
really
the
family
and
a
christmas
or
so
ago
my
wife
presented
me
with
a
very
handsome
phonograph
instrument
my
reading
therefore
is
done
to
music
and
the
necessity
for
putting
my
book
down
to
change
the
record
at
times
interferes
somewhat
with
my
train
of
thought
so
i
entered
sperry
s
library
with
appreciation
he
was
standing
by
the
fire
with
the
grave
face
and
slightly
bent
head
of
his
professional
manner
we
say
in
the
neighborhood
that
sperry
uses
his
professional
manner
as
armor
so
i
was
rather
prepared
to
do
battle
but
he
forestalled
me
horace
he
said
i
have
been
a
fool
a
driveling
idiot
we
were
getting
something
at
those
sittings
something
real
she
s
wonderful
she
s
going
to
give
it
up
but
the
fact
remains
that
she
has
some
power
we
haven
t
and
now
i
ve
discredited
her
i
see
it
plainly
he
was
rather
bitter
about
it
but
not
hostile
his
fury
was
at
himself
of
course
he
went
on
i
am
sure
that
she
got
nothing
from
hawkins
but
the
fact
remains
he
was
hurt
in
his
pride
of
her
i
wonder
i
said
if
you
kept
the
letter
hawkins
wrote
you
when
he
asked
for
a
he
was
not
sure
he
went
into
his
consulting
room
and
was
gone
for
some
time
i
took
the
opportunity
to
glance
over
his
books
and
over
the
room
arthur
wells
s
stick
was
standing
in
a
corner
and
i
took
it
up
and
examined
it
it
was
an
english
malacca
light
and
strong
and
had
seen
service
it
was
long
too
long
for
me
it
occurred
to
me
that
wells
had
been
about
my
height
and
that
it
was
odd
that
he
should
have
carried
so
long
a
stick
there
was
no
ease
in
swinging
it
from
that
to
the
memory
of
hawkins
s
face
when
sperry
took
it
the
night
of
the
murder
in
the
hall
of
the
wells
house
was
only
a
step
i
seemed
that
day
to
be
thinking
considerably
about
hawkins
when
sperry
returned
i
laid
the
stick
on
the
table
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
i
did
so
for
i
had
to
move
a
to
place
it
one
end
the
handle
was
near
the
and
the
ferrule
lay
on
a
copy
of
gibson
s
life
beyond
the
grave
which
sperry
had
evidently
been
reading
sperry
had
found
the
letter
as
i
glanced
at
it
i
recognized
the
writing
at
once
thin
and
rather
sexless
spencerian
dear
sir
since
wells
s
death
i
am
out
of
employment
before
i
took
the
position
of
butler
with
wells
i
was
valet
to
ellingham
and
before
that
in
england
to
lord
condray
i
have
a
very
good
letter
of
recommendation
from
lord
condray
if
you
need
a
servant
at
this
time
i
would
do
my
best
to
give
satisfaction
signed
arthur
hawkins
i
put
down
the
application
and
took
the
anonymous
letter
about
the
bag
from
my
pocketbook
read
this
sperry
i
said
you
know
the
letter
dane
read
it
to
us
saturday
night
but
compare
the
he
compared
the
two
with
a
slight
lifting
of
his
eyebrows
then
he
put
them
down
hawkins
he
said
hawkins
has
the
letters
and
the
bag
exactly
i
commented
dryly
in
other
words
hawkins
was
in
miss
jeremy
s
house
when
at
the
second
sitting
she
told
of
the
i
felt
rather
sorry
for
sperry
he
paced
the
room
wretchedly
the
two
letters
in
his
hand
but
why
should
he
tell
her
if
he
did
he
demanded
the
writer
of
that
anonymous
letter
was
writing
for
only
one
person
every
effort
is
made
to
conceal
his
i
felt
that
he
was
right
the
point
was
well
taken
the
question
now
is
to
whom
was
it
written
we
pondered
that
to
no
effect
that
hawkins
had
certain
letters
which
touched
on
the
wells
affair
that
they
were
probably
in
his
possession
in
the
connell
house
was
clear
enough
but
we
had
no
possible
authority
for
trying
to
get
the
letters
although
sperry
was
anxious
to
make
the
attempt
although
i
feel
he
said
that
it
is
too
late
to
help
her
very
much
she
is
innocent
i
know
that
i
think
you
know
that
too
deep
in
that
legal
mind
of
yours
it
is
wrong
to
discredit
her
because
i
did
a
foolish
he
warmed
to
his
argument
why
think
man
he
said
the
whole
first
sitting
was
practically
coincident
with
the
crime
it
was
true
enough
whatever
suspicion
might
be
cast
on
the
second
seance
the
first
at
least
remained
inexplicable
by
any
laws
we
recognized
in
a
way
i
felt
sorry
for
sperry
here
he
was
on
the
first
day
of
his
engagement
protesting
her
honesty
her
complete
ignorance
of
the
revelations
she
had
made
and
his
intention
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
and
yet
betraying
his
own
anxiety
and
possible
doubt
in
the
same
breath
she
did
not
even
know
there
was
a
family
named
wells
when
i
said
that
hawkins
had
been
employed
by
the
wells
it
meant
nothing
to
her
i
was
so
even
sperry
was
watching
he
was
in
love
with
her
but
his
scientific
mind
like
my
legal
one
was
slow
to
accept
what
during
the
past
two
weeks
it
had
been
asked
to
accept
i
left
him
at
ten
o
clock
dane
was
still
at
her
window
and
her
old
eyes
caught
me
as
i
tried
to
steal
past
she
rapped
on
the
window
and
i
was
obliged
to
go
in
obliged
too
to
tell
her
of
the
discovery
and
at
last
of
hawkins
being
in
the
connell
house
i
want
those
letters
horace
she
said
at
last
so
do
i
m
not
going
to
steal
the
question
is
where
has
he
got
them
the
question
is
dear
lady
that
they
are
not
ours
to
they
are
not
his
well
that
was
true
enough
but
i
had
done
all
the
private
investigating
i
cared
to
and
i
told
her
so
she
only
smiled
cryptically
so
far
as
i
know
dane
was
the
only
one
among
us
who
had
entirely
escaped
certain
strange
phenomena
during
that
period
and
as
i
have
only
so
far
recorded
my
own
experiences
i
shall
here
place
in
order
the
various
manifestations
made
to
the
other
members
of
the
neighborhood
club
during
that
trying
period
and
in
their
own
words
as
none
of
them
have
suffered
since
a
certain
allowance
must
be
made
for
our
nervous
strain
as
before
i
shall
offer
no
explanation
alice
robinson
on
night
following
second
seance
saw
a
light
in
room
not
referable
to
any
outside
influence
was
an
amorphous
body
which
glowed
pallidly
and
moved
about
wall
over
fireplace
gradually
coming
to
stop
in
a
corner
where
it
faded
and
disappeared
clara
dane
s
secretary
had
not
slept
much
since
first
seance
was
frequently
conscious
that
she
was
not
alone
in
room
but
on
turning
on
light
room
was
always
empty
wakened
twice
with
sense
of
extreme
cold
i
have
recorded
my
own
similar
experience
sperry
has
consistently
maintained
that
he
had
no
experiences
whatever
during
that
period
but
admits
that
he
heard
various
knockings
in
his
bedroom
at
night
which
he
attributed
to
the
lighting
of
his
furnace
and
the
resulting
expansion
of
the
furniture
due
to
heat
herbert
robinson
herbert
was
the
most
difficult
member
of
the
club
from
whom
to
secure
data
but
he
has
recently
confessed
that
he
was
wakened
one
night
by
the
light
falling
on
to
his
bed
from
a
picture
which
hung
on
the
wall
over
his
mantelpiece
and
which
stood
behind
a
clock
two
glass
vases
and
a
pair
of
candlesticks
the
door
of
his
room
was
locked
at
the
time
johnson
had
a
great
many
minor
disturbances
so
that
on
rousing
one
night
to
find
me
closing
a
window
against
a
storm
she
thought
i
was
a
spectre
and
to
this
day
insists
that
i
only
entered
her
room
when
i
heard
her
scream
for
this
reason
i
have
made
no
record
of
her
various
experiences
as
i
felt
that
her
nervous
condition
precluded
accurate
observation
as
in
all
records
of
psychic
phenomena
the
human
element
must
be
considered
and
i
do
not
attempt
either
to
analyze
these
various
phenomena
or
to
explain
them
herbert
for
instance
has
been
known
to
walk
in
his
sleep
but
i
respectfully
offer
as
opposed
to
this
that
my
watch
has
never
been
known
to
walk
at
all
and
that
johnson
s
bracelet
could
hardly
be
accused
of
an
attack
of
nerves
ix
the
following
day
was
monday
when
i
came
downstairs
i
found
a
neat
bundle
lying
in
the
hall
and
addressed
to
me
my
wife
had
followed
me
down
and
we
surveyed
it
together
i
had
a
curious
feeling
about
the
parcel
and
was
for
cutting
the
cord
with
my
knife
but
my
wife
is
careful
about
string
she
has
always
fancied
that
the
time
would
come
when
we
would
need
some
badly
and
it
would
not
be
around
i
have
an
entire
drawer
of
my
chiffonier
which
i
really
need
for
other
uses
filled
with
bundles
of
twine
pink
white
and
brown
i
recall
on
one
occasion
packing
a
in
the
dusk
in
great
hasty
and
emptying
the
drawer
containing
my
undergarments
into
it
to
discover
when
i
opened
it
on
the
train
for
my
pajamas
nothing
but
rolls
of
cord
and
several
packages
of
christmas
ribbons
so
i
was
obliged
to
wait
until
she
had
untied
the
knots
by
means
of
a
hairpin
it
was
my
overcoat
my
overcoat
apparently
uninjured
but
with
the
collection
of
keys
i
had
made
missing
the
address
was
printed
not
written
in
a
large
strong
hand
with
a
stub
pen
i
did
not
at
the
time
notice
the
loss
of
certain
papers
which
had
been
in
the
breast
pocket
i
am
rather
and
it
was
not
until
the
night
after
the
third
sitting
that
they
were
recalled
to
my
mind
at
something
after
eleven
herbert
robinson
called
me
up
at
my
office
he
was
at
sperry
s
house
sperry
having
been
his
physician
during
his
recent
illness
i
say
horace
this
is
yes
how
are
you
doing
well
sperry
says
i
m
at
his
place
now
i
m
speaking
for
him
he
s
got
a
you
were
here
last
night
he
herbert
has
a
circumlocutory
manner
over
the
phone
which
irritates
me
he
begins
slowly
and
does
not
know
how
to
stop
talk
with
him
drags
on
endlessly
well
i
admit
it
i
snapped
it
s
not
a
he
lowered
his
voice
do
you
happen
to
have
noticed
a
in
the
library
when
you
were
here
which
you
know
the
one
we
yes
i
saw
you
didn
t
by
any
chance
take
it
home
with
you
are
you
sure
certainly
i
m
you
are
an
beggar
you
know
he
explained
you
remember
about
the
and
a
stick
is
like
an
umbrella
one
is
likely
to
pick
it
up
and
one
is
not
likely
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
at
least
i
didn
oh
all
right
every
one
well
very
well
suppose
we
ll
see
you
tonight
not
unless
you
ring
off
and
let
me
do
some
work
i
said
irritably
he
rang
off
i
was
ruffled
i
admit
but
i
was
uneasy
also
to
tell
the
truth
the
affair
of
the
had
cost
me
my
i
called
up
my
wife
and
she
said
herbert
was
a
fool
and
sperry
also
but
she
made
an
exhaustive
search
of
the
premises
without
result
whoever
had
taken
the
stick
i
was
cleared
cleared
at
least
for
a
time
there
were
strange
developments
coming
that
threatened
my
peace
of
mind
it
was
that
day
that
i
discovered
that
i
was
being
watched
shadowed
i
believe
is
the
technical
word
i
daresay
i
had
been
followed
from
my
house
but
i
had
not
noticed
when
i
went
out
to
lunch
a
youngish
man
in
a
dark
overcoat
was
waiting
for
the
elevator
and
i
saw
him
again
when
i
came
out
of
my
house
we
went
downtown
again
on
the
same
car
perhaps
i
would
have
thought
nothing
of
it
had
i
not
been
summoned
to
the
suburbs
on
a
piece
of
business
concerning
a
mortgage
he
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
platform
as
i
took
the
train
to
return
to
the
city
with
his
back
to
me
i
lost
him
in
the
crowd
at
the
downtown
station
but
he
evidently
had
not
lost
me
for
stopping
to
buy
a
newspaper
i
turned
and
as
my
pause
had
evidently
been
unexpected
he
almost
ran
into
me
with
that
tendency
of
any
man
who
finds
himself
under
suspicion
to
search
his
past
for
some
dereliction
possibly
forgotten
i
puzzled
over
the
situation
for
some
time
that
afternoon
i
did
not
connect
it
with
the
wells
case
for
in
that
matter
i
was
indisputably
the
hunter
not
the
hunted
although
i
found
no
explanation
for
the
matter
i
did
not
tell
my
wife
that
evening
women
are
strange
and
she
would
i
feared
immediately
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
something
in
my
private
life
that
i
was
keeping
from
her
almost
all
women
i
have
found
although
not
themselves
of
the
charm
and
attraction
of
their
husbands
are
of
the
conviction
that
these
husbands
exert
a
dangerous
fascination
over
other
women
and
that
this
charm
which
does
not
reveal
itself
in
the
home
circle
is
used
abroad
with
occasionally
disastrous
effect
my
preoccupation
however
did
not
escape
my
wife
and
she
commented
on
it
at
dinner
you
are
generally
dull
horace
she
said
but
tonight
you
are
after
dinner
i
went
into
our
reception
room
which
is
not
lighted
unless
we
are
expecting
guests
and
peered
out
of
the
window
the
detective
or
whoever
he
might
be
was
walking
negligently
up
the
street
as
that
was
the
night
of
the
third
seance
i
find
that
my
record
covers
the
fact
that
dane
was
housecleaning
for
which
reason
we
had
not
been
asked
to
dinner
that
my
wife
and
i
dined
early
at
and
that
it
was
seven
o
clock
when
sperry
called
me
by
telephone
can
you
come
to
my
office
at
once
he
asked
i
dare
say
johnson
won
t
mind
going
to
the
dane
house
is
there
anything
new
no
but
i
want
to
get
into
the
wells
house
again
bring
the
they
were
in
the
overcoat
it
came
back
today
but
the
keys
are
did
you
lock
the
back
door
i
don
t
remember
no
of
course
not
i
didn
t
have
the
then
there
s
a
chance
he
observed
after
a
moment
s
pause
anyhow
it
s
worth
trying
herbert
told
you
about
the
stick
yes
i
never
had
it
fortunately
during
this
conversation
my
wife
was
upstairs
dressing
i
knew
quite
well
that
she
would
violently
oppose
a
second
visit
on
my
part
to
the
deserted
house
down
the
street
i
therefore
left
a
message
for
her
that
i
had
gone
on
and
finding
the
street
clear
met
sperry
at
his
this
is
the
last
sitting
horace
he
explained
and
i
feel
we
ought
to
have
the
most
complete
possible
knowledge
beforehand
we
will
be
in
a
better
position
to
understand
what
comes
there
are
two
or
three
things
we
haven
t
checked
up
he
slipped
an
arm
through
mine
and
we
started
down
the
street
i
m
going
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
horace
old
dear
he
said
remember
we
re
pledged
to
a
psychic
investigation
rats
he
said
rudely
we
are
going
to
find
out
who
killed
arthur
wells
and
if
he
deserves
hanging
we
ll
hang
or
her
it
wasn
t
elinor
wells
he
said
positively
here
s
the
point
if
he
s
been
afraid
to
go
back
for
his
overcoat
it
s
still
there
i
don
t
expect
that
however
but
the
thing
about
the
curtain
interests
me
i
ve
been
reading
over
my
copy
of
the
notes
on
the
sittings
it
was
said
you
remember
that
curtains
some
curtains
would
have
been
better
places
to
hide
the
letters
than
the
i
stopped
suddenly
by
jove
sperry
i
said
i
remember
now
my
notes
of
the
sittings
were
in
my
and
they
are
gone
they
are
he
whistled
softly
that
s
unfortunate
he
said
then
the
other
person
whoever
he
is
knows
what
we
know
he
was
considerably
startled
when
i
told
him
i
had
been
shadowed
and
insisted
that
it
referred
directly
to
the
case
in
hand
he
s
got
your
notes
he
said
and
he
s
got
to
know
what
your
next
move
is
going
to
his
intention
i
found
was
to
examine
the
carpet
outside
of
the
door
and
the
floor
beneath
it
to
discover
if
possible
whether
arthur
wells
had
fallen
there
and
been
moved
because
i
think
you
are
right
he
said
he
wouldn
t
have
been
likely
to
shoot
himself
in
a
hall
and
because
the
very
moving
of
the
body
would
be
in
itself
suspicious
then
i
want
to
look
at
the
curtains
the
curtains
would
have
been
safer
for
what
for
the
bag
with
the
letters
probably
for
she
followed
that
with
the
talk
about
hawkins
he
d
got
them
and
somebody
was
afraid
he
just
where
does
hawkins
come
in
sperry
i
asked
i
m
damned
if
i
know
he
reflected
we
may
learn
the
wells
house
was
dark
and
forbidding
we
walked
past
it
once
as
an
officer
was
making
his
rounds
in
leisurely
fashion
swinging
his
in
circles
but
on
our
return
the
street
was
empty
and
we
turned
in
at
the
side
entry
i
led
the
way
with
comparative
familiarity
it
was
you
will
remember
my
third
similar
excursion
with
sperry
behind
me
i
felt
confident
in
case
the
door
is
locked
i
have
a
few
skeleton
keys
said
sperry
we
had
reached
the
end
of
the
narrow
passage
and
emerged
into
the
square
of
brick
and
grass
that
lay
behind
the
house
while
the
night
was
clear
the
place
lay
in
comparative
darkness
sperry
stumbled
over
something
and
muttered
to
himself
the
rear
porch
lay
in
deep
shadow
we
went
up
the
steps
together
then
sperry
stopped
and
i
advanced
to
the
doorway
it
was
locked
with
my
hand
on
the
i
turned
to
sperry
he
was
struggling
violently
with
a
dark
figure
and
even
as
i
turned
they
went
over
with
a
crash
and
rolled
together
down
the
steps
only
one
of
them
rose
i
was
terrified
i
confess
it
it
was
impossible
to
see
whether
it
was
sperry
or
his
assailant
if
it
was
sperry
who
lay
in
a
heap
on
the
ground
i
felt
that
i
was
lost
i
could
not
escape
the
way
was
blocked
and
behind
me
the
door
to
which
i
now
turned
frantically
was
a
barrier
i
could
not
move
then
out
of
the
darkness
behind
me
came
sperry
s
familiar
booming
bass
i
ve
knocked
him
out
i
m
afraid
got
a
match
horace
much
shaken
i
went
down
the
steps
and
gave
sperry
a
wooden
toothpick
under
the
impression
that
it
was
a
match
that
rectified
we
bent
over
the
figure
on
the
bricks
knocked
out
for
sure
said
sperry
but
i
think
it
s
not
serious
a
watchman
i
suppose
poor
devil
we
ll
have
to
get
him
into
the
the
lock
gave
way
to
manipulation
at
last
and
the
door
swung
open
there
came
to
us
the
heavy
odor
of
all
closed
houses
a
combination
of
carpets
cooked
food
and
floor
wax
my
nerves
now
taxed
to
their
utmost
fairly
shrank
from
it
but
sperry
was
cool
he
bore
the
brunt
of
the
weight
as
we
carried
the
watchman
in
holding
him
with
his
arms
dangling
helpless
and
rather
pathetic
sperry
glanced
around
into
the
kitchen
he
said
we
can
lock
him
we
had
hardly
laid
him
on
the
floor
when
i
heard
the
slow
stride
of
the
officer
of
the
beat
he
had
turned
into
the
paved
and
was
advancing
with
measured
ponderous
steps
fortunately
i
am
an
agile
man
and
thus
i
was
able
to
get
to
the
outer
door
reverse
the
key
and
turn
it
from
the
inside
before
i
heard
him
hailing
the
watchman
hello
there
he
called
george
i
say
george
he
listened
for
a
moment
then
came
up
and
tried
the
door
i
crouched
inside
as
guilty
as
the
veriest
in
the
business
but
he
had
no
suspicion
clearly
for
he
turned
and
went
away
whistling
as
he
went
not
until
we
heard
him
going
down
the
street
again
absently
running
his
along
the
fence
palings
did
sperry
or
i
move
a
narrow
squeak
that
i
said
mopping
my
face
a
miss
is
as
good
as
a
mile
he
observed
and
there
was
a
sort
of
exultation
in
his
voice
he
is
a
born
adventurer
he
came
out
into
the
passage
and
quickly
locked
the
door
behind
him
now
friend
horace
he
said
if
you
have
anything
but
toothpicks
for
matches
we
will
look
for
the
overcoat
and
then
we
will
go
suppose
he
wakens
and
raises
an
alarm
we
ll
be
out
of
luck
that
s
as
we
had
anticipated
there
was
no
overcoat
in
the
library
and
after
listening
a
moment
at
the
kitchen
door
we
ascended
a
rear
staircase
to
the
upper
floor
i
had
it
will
be
remembered
fallen
from
a
chair
on
a
table
in
the
dressing
room
and
had
left
them
thus
overturned
when
i
charged
the
third
floor
the
room
however
was
now
in
perfect
order
and
when
i
held
my
candle
to
the
ceiling
i
perceived
that
the
bullet
hole
had
again
been
repaired
and
this
time
with
such
skill
that
i
could
not
even
locate
it
we
are
up
against
some
one
cleverer
than
we
are
sperry
i
acknowledged
and
who
has
more
to
lose
than
we
have
to
gain
he
added
cheerfully
don
t
worry
about
that
horace
you
re
a
married
man
and
i
m
not
if
a
woman
wanted
to
hide
some
letters
from
her
husband
and
chose
a
curtain
for
a
receptacle
what
room
would
hide
them
in
not
in
his
eh
he
took
the
candle
and
led
the
way
to
elinor
wells
s
bedroom
here
however
the
draperies
were
down
and
we
would
have
been
at
a
loss
had
i
not
remembered
my
wife
s
custom
of
folding
draperies
when
we
close
the
house
and
placing
them
under
the
dusting
sheets
which
cover
the
various
beds
our
inspection
of
the
curtains
was
hurried
and
broken
by
various
excursions
on
my
part
to
listen
for
the
watchman
but
he
remained
quiet
below
and
finally
we
found
what
we
were
looking
for
in
the
lining
of
one
of
the
curtains
near
the
bottom
a
long
ragged
cut
had
been
made
cut
in
a
hurry
with
curved
scissors
was
sperry
s
comment
probably
manicure
the
result
was
a
sort
of
pocket
in
the
curtain
concealed
on
the
chintz
side
which
was
the
side
which
would
hang
toward
the
room
probably
he
said
the
curtain
would
have
been
better
it
would
have
stayed
anyhow
whereas
the
bag
he
was
flushed
with
triumph
how
in
the
world
would
hawkins
know
that
he
demanded
you
can
talk
all
you
like
she
s
told
us
things
that
no
one
ever
told
before
examining
the
floor
in
the
hall
i
went
downstairs
and
listened
outside
the
kitchen
door
the
watchman
was
stirring
inside
the
room
and
groaning
occasionally
sperry
however
when
i
told
him
remained
cool
and
in
his
exultant
mood
and
i
saw
that
he
meant
to
vindicate
miss
jeremy
if
he
flung
me
into
jail
and
the
newspapers
while
doing
it
we
ll
have
a
go
at
the
floors
under
the
carpets
now
he
said
if
he
gets
noisy
you
can
go
down
with
the
i
understand
you
are
an
expert
with
the
had
a
large
rug
like
the
nursery
above
it
and
turning
back
the
carpet
was
a
simple
matter
there
had
been
a
stain
beneath
where
the
dead
man
s
head
had
lain
but
it
had
been
scrubbed
and
scraped
away
the
boards
were
white
for
an
area
of
a
square
foot
or
so
sperry
eyed
the
spot
with
indifference
not
essential
he
said
shows
good
housekeeping
that
s
all
the
point
is
are
there
other
spots
and
after
a
time
we
found
what
we
were
after
the
upper
hall
was
carpeted
and
my
penknife
came
into
requisition
to
lift
the
tacks
they
came
up
rather
easily
as
if
but
recently
put
in
that
indeed
proved
to
be
the
case
just
outside
the
door
the
boards
for
an
area
of
two
square
feet
or
more
beneath
the
carpet
had
been
scraped
and
scrubbed
with
the
lifting
of
the
carpet
came
too
a
strong
odor
as
of
ammonia
but
the
stain
of
blood
had
absolutely
disappeared
sperry
kneeling
on
the
floor
with
the
candle
held
close
examined
the
wood
not
only
scrubbed
he
said
but
scraped
down
probably
with
a
it
s
pretty
clear
horace
the
poor
devil
fell
here
there
was
a
struggle
and
he
went
down
he
lay
there
for
a
while
too
until
some
plan
was
thought
out
a
man
does
not
usually
kill
himself
in
a
hallway
it
s
a
sort
of
solitary
deed
he
fell
here
and
was
dragged
into
the
room
the
angle
of
the
bullet
in
the
ceiling
would
probably
show
it
came
from
here
too
and
went
through
the
we
were
startled
at
that
moment
by
a
loud
banging
below
sperry
leaped
to
his
feet
and
caught
up
his
hat
the
watchman
he
said
we
d
better
get
out
he
ll
have
all
the
neighbors
in
at
that
he
was
still
hammering
on
the
door
as
we
went
down
the
rear
stairs
and
sperry
stood
outside
the
door
and
to
one
side
keep
out
of
range
horace
he
cautioned
me
and
to
the
watchman
now
george
we
will
put
the
key
under
the
door
and
in
ten
minutes
you
may
come
out
don
t
come
sooner
i
ve
warned
by
the
faint
light
from
outside
i
could
see
him
stooping
not
in
front
of
the
door
but
behind
it
and
it
was
well
he
did
for
the
moment
the
key
was
on
the
other
side
a
shot
zipped
through
one
of
the
lower
panels
i
had
not
expected
it
and
it
set
me
to
shivering
no
more
of
that
george
said
sperry
calmly
and
cheerfully
this
is
a
quiet
neighborhood
and
we
don
t
like
shooting
what
is
more
my
friend
here
is
very
expert
with
his
own
particular
weapon
and
at
any
moment
he
may
go
to
the
in
the
library
and
i
have
no
idea
why
sperry
chose
to
be
facetious
at
that
time
and
my
resentment
rises
as
i
record
it
for
when
we
reached
the
yard
we
heard
the
officer
running
along
the
calling
as
he
ran
the
fence
quick
sperry
said
i
am
not
very
good
at
fences
as
a
rule
but
i
leaped
that
one
like
a
cat
and
came
down
in
a
barrel
of
on
the
other
side
getting
me
out
was
a
breathless
matter
finally
accomplished
by
turning
the
barrel
over
so
that
i
could
crawl
out
we
could
hear
the
excited
voices
of
the
two
men
beyond
the
fence
and
we
ran
i
was
better
than
sperry
at
that
i
ran
like
a
rabbit
i
never
even
felt
my
legs
and
sperry
pounded
on
behind
me
we
heard
behind
us
one
of
the
men
climbing
the
fence
but
in
jumping
down
he
seemed
to
have
struck
the
side
of
the
overturned
barrel
probably
it
rolled
and
threw
him
for
that
part
of
my
mind
which
was
not
intent
on
flight
heard
him
fall
and
curse
loudly
go
to
it
sperry
panted
behind
me
roll
over
and
break
your
this
i
need
hardly
explain
was
meant
for
our
pursuer
we
turned
a
corner
and
were
out
on
one
of
the
main
thoroughfares
instantly
so
innate
is
cunning
to
the
human
brain
we
fell
to
walking
sedately
it
was
as
well
that
we
did
for
we
had
not
gone
a
half
block
before
we
saw
our
policeman
again
lumbering
toward
us
and
blowing
a
whistle
as
he
ran
stop
and
get
this
sperry
directed
me
and
don
t
breathe
so
the
policeman
stared
at
us
fixedly
stopping
to
do
so
but
all
he
saw
was
two
and
men
one
of
them
rather
elderly
who
was
hailing
a
i
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
draw
my
watch
and
consult
it
just
in
good
time
i
said
distinctly
and
we
mounted
the
car
step
sperry
remained
on
the
platform
and
lighted
a
cigar
this
gave
him
a
chance
to
look
back
rather
narrow
squeak
that
he
observed
as
he
came
in
and
sat
down
beside
me
your
gray
hairs
probably
saved
i
was
quite
numb
from
the
waist
down
from
my
tumble
and
from
running
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
breathe
quietly
suddenly
sperry
fell
to
laughing
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
yourself
in
that
barrel
and
crawling
out
he
said
we
reached
dane
s
to
find
that
miss
jeremy
had
already
arrived
looking
rather
pale
as
i
had
noticed
she
always
did
before
a
seance
her
color
had
faded
and
her
eyes
seemed
sunken
in
her
head
not
ill
are
you
sperry
asked
her
as
he
took
her
hand
not
at
all
but
i
am
anxious
i
always
am
these
things
do
not
come
for
the
this
is
the
last
time
you
have
yes
the
last
x
it
appeared
that
herbert
robinson
had
been
reading
during
his
convalescence
a
considerable
amount
of
psychic
literature
and
that
we
were
to
hold
this
third
and
final
sitting
under
test
conditions
as
before
the
room
had
been
stripped
of
furniture
and
the
cloth
and
rod
which
formed
the
low
screen
behind
miss
jeremy
s
chair
were
not
of
her
own
providing
but
herbert
s
he
had
also
provided
for
some
reason
or
other
eight
small
glass
cups
into
which
he
placed
the
legs
of
the
two
tables
and
in
a
manner
he
set
out
on
the
large
stand
a
piece
of
white
paper
a
pencil
and
a
spool
of
black
thread
it
is
characteristic
of
miss
jeremy
and
of
her
own
ignorance
of
the
methods
employed
in
professional
seances
that
she
was
as
much
interested
and
puzzled
as
we
were
when
he
had
completed
his
preparations
herbert
made
a
brief
speech
members
of
the
neighborhood
club
he
said
impressively
we
have
agreed
among
ourselves
that
this
is
to
be
our
last
meeting
for
the
purpose
that
is
before
us
i
have
felt
therefore
that
in
justice
to
the
medium
this
final
seance
should
leave
us
with
every
conviction
of
its
genuineness
whatever
phenomena
occur
the
medium
must
be
as
she
has
been
above
suspicion
for
the
replies
of
her
control
no
particular
precaution
seems
necessary
or
possible
but
the
first
seance
divided
itself
into
two
parts
an
early
period
when
so
far
as
we
could
observe
the
medium
was
at
least
partly
conscious
possibly
fully
so
when
physical
demonstrations
occurred
and
a
second
or
trance
period
during
which
we
received
replies
to
questions
it
is
for
the
physical
phenomena
that
i
am
about
to
take
certain
are
you
going
to
tie
me
miss
jeremy
asked
do
you
object
not
at
all
but
with
what
with
silk
thread
herbert
said
smilingly
she
held
out
her
wrists
at
once
but
herbert
placed
her
in
her
chair
and
proceeded
to
wrap
her
chair
and
all
in
a
strong
network
of
fine
threads
drawn
sufficiently
taut
to
snap
with
any
movement
he
finished
by
placing
her
feet
on
the
sheet
of
paper
and
outlining
their
position
there
with
a
pencil
line
the
proceedings
were
saved
from
absurdity
by
what
we
all
felt
was
the
extreme
gravity
of
the
situation
there
were
present
in
the
room
dane
the
robinsons
sperry
my
wife
and
myself
clara
dane
s
secretary
had
begged
off
on
the
plea
of
nervousness
from
the
earlier
and
physical
portion
of
the
seance
and
was
to
remain
outside
in
the
hall
until
the
trance
commenced
sperry
objected
to
this
as
movement
in
the
circle
during
the
trance
had
in
the
first
seance
induced
fretful
uneasiness
in
the
medium
but
clara
appealed
to
begged
to
be
allowed
to
remain
outside
until
she
was
required
and
showed
such
unmistakable
nervousness
that
we
finally
agreed
would
a
slight
noise
disturb
her
dane
asked
miss
jeremy
thought
not
if
the
circle
remained
unbroken
and
dane
considered
bring
me
my
stick
from
the
hall
horace
she
said
and
tell
clara
i
ll
rap
on
the
floor
with
it
when
i
want
i
found
a
stick
in
the
rack
outside
and
brought
it
in
the
lights
were
still
on
in
the
chandelier
overhead
and
as
i
gave
the
stick
to
dane
i
heard
sperry
speaking
sharply
behind
me
where
did
you
get
that
stick
he
demanded
in
the
hall
i
i
never
saw
it
before
said
dane
perhaps
it
is
herbert
but
i
caught
sperry
s
eye
we
had
both
recognized
it
it
was
arthur
wells
s
the
one
which
sperry
had
taken
from
his
room
and
which
in
turn
had
been
taken
from
sperry
s
library
sperry
was
watching
me
with
a
sort
of
cynical
amusement
you
re
an
beggar
horace
he
said
you
didn
t
by
any
chance
stop
here
on
your
way
back
from
my
place
the
other
night
did
you
i
did
but
i
didn
t
bring
that
look
here
horace
he
said
more
gently
you
come
in
and
see
me
some
day
soon
you
re
not
as
fit
as
you
ought
to
i
confess
to
a
sort
of
helpless
indignation
that
was
far
from
the
composure
the
occasion
required
but
the
others
i
believe
were
fully
convinced
that
no
human
agency
had
operated
to
bring
the
stick
into
dane
s
house
a
belief
that
prepared
them
for
anything
that
might
occur
a
number
of
things
occurred
almost
as
soon
as
the
lights
were
out
interrupting
a
train
of
thought
in
which
i
saw
myself
in
the
first
stages
of
mental
decay
and
carrying
about
the
streets
not
only
and
but
other
portable
property
belonging
to
my
friends
perhaps
my
excitement
had
a
bad
effect
on
the
medium
she
was
uneasy
and
complained
that
the
threads
that
bound
her
arms
were
tight
she
was
distinctly
fretful
but
after
a
time
she
settled
down
in
her
chair
her
figure
a
deeper
shadow
in
the
of
the
room
seemed
sagged
seemed
in
some
indefinable
way
smaller
but
there
was
none
of
the
stertorous
breathing
that
preceded
trance
then
suddenly
a
bell
that
sperry
had
placed
on
the
stand
beyond
the
black
curtain
commenced
to
ring
it
rang
at
first
gently
then
violently
it
made
a
hideous
clamor
i
had
a
curious
sense
that
it
was
ringing
up
in
the
air
near
the
top
of
the
curtain
it
was
a
relief
to
have
it
thrown
to
the
ground
its
racket
silenced
quite
without
warning
immediately
after
my
chair
twisted
under
me
i
am
being
turned
around
i
said
in
a
low
tone
it
as
if
something
has
taken
hold
of
the
back
of
the
chair
and
is
twisting
it
it
has
stopped
i
had
been
turned
fully
a
quarter
round
for
five
minutes
by
the
luminous
dial
of
my
watch
on
the
table
before
me
nothing
further
occurred
except
that
the
black
curtain
appeared
to
swell
as
in
a
wind
there
is
something
behind
it
alice
robinson
said
in
a
terrorized
tone
something
behind
it
it
is
not
possible
herbert
assured
her
nothing
that
is
there
is
only
one
door
and
it
is
closed
i
have
examined
the
walls
and
floor
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
something
soft
and
fragrant
fell
on
to
the
table
near
me
i
had
not
noticed
herbert
when
he
placed
the
flowers
from
dane
s
table
on
the
stand
and
i
was
more
startled
than
the
others
then
the
glass
prisms
in
the
chandelier
over
our
heads
clinked
together
as
if
they
had
been
swept
by
a
finger
more
of
the
flowers
came
we
were
pelted
with
them
and
into
the
quiet
that
followed
there
came
a
light
fine
but
steady
tattoo
on
the
table
in
our
midst
then
at
last
silence
and
the
medium
in
deep
trance
and
dane
rapping
on
the
floor
for
clara
when
clara
came
in
dane
told
her
to
switch
on
the
lights
miss
jeremy
had
dropped
in
her
chair
until
the
silk
across
her
chest
was
held
taut
but
investigation
showed
that
none
of
the
threads
were
broken
and
that
her
evening
slippers
still
fitted
into
the
outline
on
the
paper
beneath
them
without
getting
up
sperry
reached
to
the
stand
behind
miss
jeremy
and
brought
into
view
a
piece
of
sculptor
s
clay
he
had
placed
there
the
handle
of
the
bell
was
now
jammed
into
the
mass
he
had
only
time
to
show
it
to
us
when
the
medium
began
to
speak
i
find
on
the
earlier
part
of
this
record
that
i
have
omitted
mention
of
miss
jeremy
s
so
suddenly
had
we
jumped
that
first
evening
into
the
trail
that
led
us
to
the
wells
case
that
beyond
the
rather
raucous
and
possibly
the
extraneous
matter
referring
to
mother
goose
and
so
on
we
had
been
saved
the
usual
preliminary
patter
of
the
average
control
on
this
night
however
we
were
obliged
to
sit
impatiently
through
a
rambling
discourse
given
in
a
manner
on
the
deterioration
of
moral
standards
clara
s
notes
i
find
that
the
subject
matter
is
without
originality
and
the
diction
inferior
but
the
lecture
ceased
abruptly
and
the
time
for
questions
had
come
now
herbert
said
we
want
you
to
go
back
to
the
house
where
you
saw
the
dead
man
on
the
floor
you
know
his
name
don
t
you
there
was
a
pause
yes
of
course
i
do
arthur
had
been
known
to
most
of
us
by
his
christian
name
but
the
initials
were
correct
how
do
you
know
it
is
an
on
letters
was
the
laconic
answer
then
letters
letters
who
has
the
letters
do
you
know
whose
cane
this
is
will
you
tell
us
up
to
that
time
the
replies
had
come
easily
and
quickly
but
beginning
with
the
cane
question
the
medium
was
in
difficulties
she
moved
uneasily
and
spoke
irritably
the
replies
were
slow
and
grudging
foreign
subjects
were
introduced
as
now
horace
s
wife
certainly
bullies
him
said
the
voice
he
s
afraid
of
her
and
the
the
the
whose
cane
is
this
herbert
repeated
mr
ellingham
this
created
a
profound
sensation
how
do
you
know
that
he
carried
it
at
the
seashore
he
wrote
in
the
sand
with
what
did
he
write
ten
o
he
wrote
ten
o
clock
in
the
sand
and
the
waves
came
and
washed
it
away
horace
said
my
wife
leaning
forward
why
not
ask
her
about
that
stock
of
mine
if
it
is
going
down
i
ought
to
sell
oughtn
t
i
herbert
eyed
her
with
some
exasperation
we
are
here
to
make
a
serious
investigation
he
said
if
the
members
of
the
club
will
keep
their
attention
on
what
we
are
doing
we
may
get
somewhere
now
to
the
medium
the
man
is
dead
and
the
revolver
is
beside
him
did
he
kill
himself
no
he
attacked
her
when
he
found
the
and
she
shot
him
i
can
t
tell
you
try
very
hard
it
is
i
don
t
know
was
the
fretful
reply
she
may
have
she
hated
him
i
don
t
know
she
says
she
she
says
she
killed
him
but
there
was
no
reply
to
this
although
herbert
repeated
it
several
times
instead
the
voice
of
the
control
began
to
recite
a
verse
of
poetry
a
cheap
sentimental
bit
of
trash
it
was
maddening
under
the
circumstances
do
you
know
where
the
letters
are
hawkins
has
they
were
not
hidden
in
the
curtain
this
was
sperry
no
the
police
might
have
searched
the
where
were
these
letters
there
was
no
direct
reply
to
this
but
instead
he
found
them
when
he
was
looking
for
his
razorstrop
they
were
in
the
top
of
a
closet
his
revolver
was
there
too
he
went
back
and
got
it
it
was
there
was
a
profound
silence
followed
by
a
slight
exclamation
from
sperry
as
he
leaped
to
his
feet
the
screen
at
the
end
of
the
room
which
cut
off
the
light
from
clara
s
candle
was
toppling
the
next
instant
it
fell
and
we
saw
clara
sprawled
over
her
table
in
a
dead
faint
xi
in
this
the
final
chapter
of
the
record
of
these
seances
i
shall
give
as
briefly
as
possible
the
events
of
the
day
following
the
third
sitting
i
shall
explain
the
mystery
of
arthur
wells
s
death
and
i
shall
give
the
solution
arrived
at
by
the
neighborhood
club
as
to
the
strange
communications
from
the
medium
miss
jeremy
now
sperry
s
wife
but
there
are
some
things
i
can
not
explain
do
our
spirits
live
on
on
this
earth
plane
now
and
then
obedient
to
the
wills
of
those
yet
living
is
death
then
only
a
gateway
into
higher
space
from
which
through
the
open
door
of
a
sensitive
mind
we
may
be
brought
back
on
occasion
to
commit
the
inadequate
absurdities
of
the
physical
seance
or
is
sperry
right
and
do
certain
individuals
manifest
powers
of
a
purely
physical
nature
but
powers
which
sperry
characterizes
as
the
survival
of
some
development
by
which
at
one
time
we
knew
how
to
liberate
a
forgotten
form
of
energy
who
can
say
we
do
not
know
we
have
had
to
accept
these
things
as
they
have
been
accepted
through
the
ages
and
give
them
either
a
spiritual
or
a
purely
natural
explanation
as
our
minds
happen
to
be
adventurous
or
analytic
in
type
but
outside
of
the
purely
physical
phenomena
of
those
seances
we
are
provided
with
an
explanation
which
satisfies
the
neighborhood
club
even
if
it
fails
to
satisfy
the
convinced
spiritist
we
have
been
accused
merely
of
substituting
one
mystery
for
another
but
i
reply
by
saying
that
the
mystery
we
substitute
is
not
a
mystery
but
an
acknowledged
fact
on
tuesday
morning
i
wakened
after
an
uneasy
night
i
knew
certain
things
knew
them
definitely
in
the
clear
light
of
morning
hawkins
had
the
letters
that
arthur
wells
had
found
that
was
one
thing
i
had
not
taken
ellingham
s
stick
to
dane
s
house
that
was
another
i
had
not
done
it
i
had
placed
it
on
the
table
and
had
not
touched
it
again
but
those
were
immaterial
compared
with
one
outstanding
fact
any
supernatural
solution
would
imply
full
knowledge
by
whatever
power
had
controlled
the
medium
and
there
was
not
full
knowledge
there
was
on
the
contrary
a
definite
place
beyond
which
the
medium
could
not
go
she
did
not
know
who
had
killed
arthur
wells
to
my
surprise
sperry
and
herbert
robinson
came
together
to
see
me
that
morning
at
my
office
sperry
like
myself
was
pale
and
tired
but
herbert
was
restless
and
talkative
for
all
the
world
like
a
terrier
on
the
scent
of
a
rat
they
had
brought
a
newspaper
account
of
an
attempt
by
burglars
to
rob
the
wells
house
and
the
usual
police
formula
that
arrests
were
expected
to
be
made
that
day
there
was
a
diagram
of
the
house
and
a
picture
of
the
kitchen
door
with
an
arrow
indicating
the
hawkins
will
be
here
soon
sperry
said
rather
casually
after
i
had
read
the
clipping
here
yes
he
is
bringing
a
letter
from
miss
jeremy
the
letter
is
merely
a
blind
we
want
to
see
herbert
was
examining
the
door
of
my
office
he
set
the
spring
lock
he
may
try
to
bolt
he
explained
we
re
in
this
pretty
deep
you
how
about
a
record
of
what
he
says
sperry
asked
i
pressed
a
button
and
miss
joyce
came
in
take
the
testimony
of
the
man
who
is
coming
in
miss
joyce
i
directed
take
everything
we
say
any
of
us
can
you
tell
the
different
voices
she
thought
she
could
and
took
up
her
position
in
the
next
room
with
the
door
partly
open
i
can
still
see
hawkins
as
sperry
let
him
in
a
tall
cadaverous
man
of
good
manners
and
an
english
accent
a
superior
servant
he
was
cool
but
rather
resentful
i
judged
that
he
considered
carrying
letters
as
in
no
way
a
part
of
his
work
and
that
he
was
careful
of
his
dignity
miss
jeremy
sent
this
sir
he
said
then
his
eyes
took
in
sperry
and
herbert
and
he
drew
himself
up
i
see
he
said
it
wasn
t
the
letter
then
not
entirely
we
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
very
well
but
his
eyes
went
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
you
were
in
the
employ
of
wells
we
know
that
also
we
saw
you
there
the
night
he
died
but
some
time
after
his
death
what
time
did
you
get
in
that
night
about
midnight
i
am
not
who
told
you
of
what
had
happened
i
told
you
that
before
i
met
the
detectives
going
exactly
now
hawkins
you
had
come
in
locked
the
door
and
placed
the
key
outside
for
the
other
servants
yes
how
do
you
expect
us
to
believe
that
sperry
demanded
irritably
there
was
only
one
key
could
you
lock
yourself
in
and
then
place
the
key
outside
yes
sir
he
replied
impassively
by
opening
the
kitchen
window
i
could
reach
out
and
hang
it
on
the
you
were
out
of
the
house
then
at
the
time
wells
died
i
can
prove
it
by
as
many
witnesses
as
you
wish
to
now
about
these
letters
hawkins
sperry
said
the
letters
in
the
bag
have
you
still
got
them
he
half
rose
we
had
given
him
a
chair
facing
the
light
and
then
sat
down
again
what
letters
don
t
beat
about
the
bush
we
know
you
have
the
letters
and
we
want
i
don
t
intend
to
give
them
up
will
you
tell
us
how
you
got
them
he
hesitated
if
you
do
not
know
already
i
do
not
care
to
i
placed
the
letter
to
a
before
him
you
wrote
this
i
think
i
said
he
was
genuinely
startled
more
than
that
indeed
for
his
face
twitched
suppose
i
did
he
said
i
m
not
admitting
will
you
tell
us
for
whom
it
was
meant
you
know
a
great
deal
already
gentlemen
why
not
find
that
out
from
where
you
learned
the
rest
you
know
then
where
we
learned
what
we
know
that
s
easy
he
said
bitterly
she
s
told
you
enough
i
daresay
she
doesn
t
know
it
all
of
course
any
more
than
i
do
he
added
will
you
give
us
the
letters
i
haven
t
said
i
have
them
i
haven
t
admitted
i
wrote
that
one
on
the
desk
suppose
i
have
them
i
ll
not
give
them
up
except
to
the
district
by
she
do
you
refer
to
miss
jeremy
i
asked
he
stared
at
me
and
then
smiled
faintly
you
know
who
i
we
tried
to
assure
him
that
we
were
not
in
a
sense
seeking
to
involve
him
in
the
situation
and
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
state
our
position
briefly
i
d
better
explain
hawkins
we
are
not
doing
police
work
but
owing
to
a
chain
of
circumstances
we
have
learned
that
wells
did
not
kill
himself
he
was
murdered
or
at
least
shot
by
some
one
else
it
may
not
have
been
deliberate
owing
to
what
we
have
learned
certain
people
are
under
suspicion
we
want
to
clear
things
up
for
our
own
then
why
is
some
one
taking
down
what
i
say
in
the
next
room
he
could
only
have
guessed
it
but
he
saw
that
he
was
right
by
our
faces
he
smiled
bitterly
go
on
he
said
take
it
down
it
can
t
hurt
anybody
i
don
t
know
who
did
it
and
that
s
god
s
and
after
long
wrangling
that
was
as
far
as
we
got
he
suspected
who
had
done
it
but
he
did
not
know
he
absolutely
refused
to
surrender
the
letters
in
his
possession
and
a
sense
of
delicacy
i
think
kept
us
all
from
pressing
the
question
of
the
a
matter
that
s
a
personal
affair
he
said
i
ve
had
a
good
bit
of
trouble
i
m
thinking
now
of
going
back
to
and
as
i
say
we
did
not
insist
when
he
had
gone
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
say
he
had
left
the
same
impression
on
all
of
us
i
think
of
trouble
but
not
of
crime
of
a
man
fairly
driven
of
wretchedness
that
was
almost
despair
he
still
had
the
letters
he
had
after
all
as
much
right
to
them
as
we
had
which
was
actually
no
right
at
all
and
whatever
it
was
he
still
had
his
secret
herbert
was
almost
childishly
crestfallen
sperry
s
attitude
was
more
philosophical
a
woman
of
course
he
said
the
a
letter
shows
it
he
tried
to
get
her
back
perhaps
by
holding
the
letters
over
her
head
and
it
hasn
t
worked
out
poor
devil
only
who
is
the
woman
it
was
that
night
the
fifteenth
day
after
the
crime
that
the
solution
came
came
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
my
door
i
was
in
the
library
reading
or
trying
to
read
a
rather
abstruse
book
on
psychic
phenomena
my
wife
i
recall
had
just
asked
me
to
change
a
banjo
record
for
the
end
of
a
pleasant
day
when
the
bell
rang
in
our
modest
establishment
the
maids
retire
early
and
it
is
my
custom
on
those
rare
occasions
when
the
bell
rings
after
nine
o
clock
to
answer
the
door
myself
to
my
surprise
it
was
sperry
accompanied
by
two
ladies
one
of
them
heavily
veiled
it
was
not
until
i
had
ushered
them
into
the
reception
room
and
lighted
the
gas
that
i
saw
who
they
were
it
was
elinor
wells
in
deep
mourning
and
clara
dane
s
companion
and
secretary
i
am
afraid
i
was
rather
excited
for
i
took
sperry
s
hat
from
him
and
placed
it
on
the
head
of
a
marble
bust
which
i
had
given
my
wife
on
our
last
anniversary
and
sperry
says
that
i
drew
a
up
beside
elinor
wells
with
great
care
i
do
not
know
it
has
however
passed
into
history
in
the
club
where
every
now
and
then
for
some
time
herbert
offered
one
of
the
ladies
a
cigar
with
my
compliments
my
wife
i
believe
was
advancing
along
the
corridor
when
sperry
closed
the
door
as
she
had
only
had
time
to
see
that
a
woman
was
in
the
room
she
was
naturally
resentful
and
retired
to
the
upper
floor
where
i
found
her
considerably
upset
some
time
later
while
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
was
not
thinking
clearly
at
the
opening
of
the
interview
i
know
that
i
was
puzzled
at
the
presence
of
dane
s
secretary
but
i
doubtless
accepted
it
as
having
some
connection
with
clara
s
notes
and
sperry
at
the
beginning
made
no
comment
on
her
at
all
mrs
wells
suggested
that
we
come
here
horace
he
began
we
may
need
a
legal
mind
on
this
i
m
not
sure
or
rather
i
think
it
unlikely
but
just
in
case
suppose
you
tell
him
i
have
no
record
of
the
story
elinor
wells
told
that
night
in
our
little
with
clara
sitting
in
a
corner
grave
and
white
it
was
fragmentary
but
i
got
it
all
at
last
charlie
ellingham
had
killed
arthur
wells
but
in
a
struggle
in
parts
the
story
was
sordid
enough
she
did
not
spare
herself
or
her
motives
she
had
wanted
luxury
and
arthur
had
not
succeeded
as
he
had
promised
they
were
in
debt
and
living
beyond
their
means
but
even
that
she
hastened
to
add
would
not
have
mattered
had
he
not
been
brutal
with
her
he
had
made
her
life
very
wretched
but
on
the
subject
of
charlie
ellingham
she
was
emphatic
she
knew
that
there
had
been
talk
but
there
had
been
no
real
basis
for
it
she
had
turned
to
him
for
comfort
and
he
gave
her
love
she
didn
t
know
where
he
was
now
and
didn
t
greatly
care
but
she
would
like
to
recover
and
destroy
some
letters
he
had
written
her
she
was
looking
crushed
and
ill
and
she
told
her
story
incoordinately
and
nervously
reduced
to
its
elements
it
was
as
follows
on
the
night
of
arthur
wells
s
death
they
were
dressing
for
a
ball
she
had
made
a
private
arrangement
with
ellingham
to
plead
a
headache
at
the
last
moment
and
let
arthur
go
alone
but
he
had
been
so
insistent
that
she
had
been
forced
to
go
after
all
she
had
sent
the
governess
suzanne
gautier
out
to
telephone
ellingham
not
to
come
but
he
was
not
at
his
house
and
the
message
was
left
with
his
valet
as
it
turned
out
he
had
already
started
elinor
was
dressed
all
but
her
and
had
put
on
a
negligee
to
wait
for
the
governess
to
return
and
help
her
arthur
was
in
his
and
she
heard
him
grumbling
about
having
no
blades
for
his
safety
razor
he
got
out
a
case
of
razors
and
searched
for
the
strop
when
she
remembered
where
the
strop
was
it
was
too
late
the
letters
had
been
beside
it
and
he
was
coming
toward
her
with
them
in
his
hand
she
was
terrified
he
had
read
only
one
but
that
was
enough
he
muttered
something
and
turned
away
she
saw
his
face
as
he
went
toward
where
the
revolver
had
been
hidden
from
the
children
and
she
screamed
charlie
ellingham
heard
her
the
door
had
been
left
unlocked
by
the
governess
and
he
was
in
the
lower
hall
he
ran
up
and
the
two
men
grappled
the
first
shot
was
fired
by
arthur
it
struck
the
ceiling
the
second
she
was
doubtful
about
she
thought
the
revolver
was
still
in
arthur
s
hand
it
was
all
horrible
he
went
down
like
a
stone
in
the
hallway
outside
the
door
they
were
nearly
mad
the
two
of
them
they
had
dragged
the
body
in
and
then
faced
each
other
ellingham
was
for
calling
the
police
at
once
and
surrendering
but
she
had
kept
him
away
from
the
telephone
she
maintained
and
i
think
it
very
possible
that
her
whole
thought
was
for
the
children
and
the
effect
on
their
after
lives
of
such
a
scandal
and
after
all
nothing
could
help
the
man
on
the
floor
it
was
while
they
were
trying
to
formulate
some
concerted
plan
that
they
heard
footsteps
below
and
thinking
it
was
mademoiselle
gautier
she
drove
ellingham
into
the
rear
of
the
house
from
which
later
he
managed
to
escape
but
it
was
clara
who
was
coming
up
the
stairs
she
had
been
our
first
governess
for
the
children
elinor
said
and
she
often
came
in
she
had
made
a
birthday
smock
for
buddy
and
she
had
it
in
her
hand
she
almost
fainted
i
couldn
t
tell
her
about
charlie
ellingham
i
couldn
t
i
told
her
we
had
been
struggling
and
that
i
was
afraid
i
had
shot
him
she
is
quick
she
knew
just
what
to
do
we
worked
fast
she
said
a
suicide
would
not
have
fired
one
shot
into
the
ceiling
and
she
fixed
that
it
was
terrible
and
all
the
time
he
lay
there
with
his
eyes
half
open
the
letters
it
seems
were
all
over
the
place
elinor
thought
of
the
curtain
cut
a
receptacle
for
them
but
she
was
afraid
of
the
police
finally
she
gave
them
to
clara
who
was
to
take
them
away
and
burn
them
they
did
everything
they
could
think
of
all
the
time
listening
for
suzanne
gautier
s
return
filled
the
second
empty
chamber
of
the
revolver
dragged
the
body
out
of
the
hall
and
washed
the
carpet
and
called
doctor
sperry
knowing
that
he
was
at
dane
s
and
could
not
come
clara
had
only
a
little
time
and
with
the
letters
in
her
handbag
she
started
down
the
stairs
there
she
heard
some
one
possibly
ellingham
on
the
back
stairs
and
in
her
haste
she
fell
hurting
her
knee
and
she
must
have
dropped
the
handbag
at
that
time
they
knew
now
that
hawkins
had
found
it
later
on
but
for
a
few
days
they
didn
t
know
and
hence
the
advertisement
i
think
we
would
better
explain
hawkins
sperry
said
hawkins
was
married
to
miss
clara
here
some
years
ago
while
she
was
with
wells
they
had
kept
it
a
secret
and
recently
she
has
broken
with
he
was
infatuated
with
another
woman
clara
said
briefly
that
s
a
personal
matter
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
it
explains
hawkins
s
it
doesn
t
explain
how
that
medium
knew
everything
that
happened
clara
put
in
excitedly
she
knew
it
all
even
the
library
paste
i
can
tell
you
johnson
i
was
close
to
fainting
a
dozen
times
before
i
finally
did
did
you
know
of
our
seances
i
asked
wells
yes
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
i
haven
t
been
in
florida
how
could
i
the
children
are
there
but
i
did
you
tell
charlie
ellingham
about
them
after
the
second
one
i
warned
him
and
i
think
he
went
to
the
house
one
bullet
was
somewhere
in
the
ceiling
or
in
the
floor
of
the
nursery
i
thought
it
ought
to
be
found
i
don
t
know
whether
he
found
it
or
not
i
ve
been
afraid
to
see
she
sat
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
in
her
lap
she
was
a
proud
woman
and
surrender
had
come
hard
the
struggle
was
marked
in
her
face
she
looked
as
though
she
had
not
slept
for
days
you
think
i
am
frightened
she
said
slowly
and
i
am
terribly
frightened
but
not
about
discovery
that
has
come
and
can
not
be
then
why
how
does
this
woman
this
medium
know
these
things
her
voice
rose
with
an
unexpected
hysterical
catch
it
is
superhuman
i
am
almost
we
re
going
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
sperry
said
soothingly
be
sure
that
it
is
not
what
you
think
it
is
elinor
there
s
a
simple
explanation
and
i
think
i
ve
got
it
what
about
the
stick
that
was
taken
from
my
library
will
you
tell
me
how
you
came
to
have
it
doctor
yes
i
took
it
from
the
lower
hall
the
night
the
night
it
it
was
charlie
ellingham
s
he
had
left
it
there
we
had
to
have
it
doctor
alone
it
might
not
mean
much
but
with
the
other
things
you
knew
tell
them
i
stole
it
from
your
office
clara
said
looking
straight
ahead
we
had
to
have
it
i
knew
at
the
second
sitting
that
it
was
when
did
you
take
it
on
monday
morning
i
went
for
dane
s
medicine
and
you
had
promised
her
a
book
do
you
remember
i
told
your
man
and
he
allowed
me
to
go
up
to
the
library
it
was
there
on
the
table
i
had
expected
to
have
to
search
for
it
but
it
was
lying
out
i
fastened
it
to
my
belt
under
my
long
and
placed
it
in
the
rack
at
dane
s
sperry
was
watching
her
intently
with
the
same
sort
of
grim
intentness
he
wears
when
examining
a
chest
i
put
it
in
the
closet
in
my
room
i
meant
to
get
rid
of
it
when
i
had
a
little
time
i
don
t
know
how
it
got
downstairs
but
i
think
yes
we
are
a
housemaid
was
washing
closets
i
suppose
she
found
it
and
thinking
it
was
one
of
dane
s
took
it
downstairs
that
is
unless
it
was
clear
that
like
elinor
she
had
a
supernatural
explanation
in
her
mind
she
looked
gaunt
and
haggard
mr
ellingham
was
anxious
to
get
it
she
finished
he
had
taken
johnson
s
overcoat
by
mistake
one
night
when
you
were
both
in
the
house
and
the
notes
were
in
it
he
saw
that
the
stick
was
clara
sperry
asked
did
you
see
the
day
you
advertised
for
your
bag
another
similar
advertisement
i
saw
it
it
frightened
you
have
no
idea
who
inserted
it
none
did
you
ever
see
miss
jeremy
before
the
first
sitting
or
hear
of
her
or
between
the
seances
elinor
rose
and
drew
her
veil
down
we
must
go
she
said
surely
now
you
will
cease
these
terrible
investigations
i
can
not
stand
much
more
i
am
going
there
will
be
no
more
seances
sperry
said
gravely
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
turned
to
me
i
daresay
because
i
represented
what
to
her
was
her
supreme
dread
the
law
my
dear
girl
i
said
we
are
not
going
to
do
anything
the
neighborhood
club
has
been
doing
a
little
amateur
research
work
which
is
now
over
that
is
sperry
took
them
away
in
his
car
but
he
turned
on
the
wait
downstairs
for
me
he
said
i
am
coming
i
remained
in
the
library
until
he
returned
uneasily
pacing
the
floor
for
where
were
we
after
all
we
had
had
the
medium
s
story
elaborated
and
confirmed
but
the
fact
remained
that
step
by
step
through
her
unknown
control
the
neighborhood
club
had
followed
a
tragedy
from
its
beginning
or
almost
its
beginning
to
its
end
was
everything
on
which
i
had
built
my
life
to
go
its
philosophy
its
science
even
its
theology
before
the
revelations
of
a
young
woman
who
knew
hardly
the
rudiments
of
the
very
things
she
was
destroying
was
death
then
not
peace
and
an
awakening
to
new
things
but
a
wretched
and
dissociated
clutching
after
the
old
a
wrench
which
only
loosened
but
did
not
break
our
earthly
ties
it
was
well
that
sperry
came
back
when
he
did
bringing
with
him
a
breath
of
fresh
night
air
and
stalwart
sanity
he
found
me
still
pacing
the
room
the
thing
i
want
to
know
i
said
fretfully
is
where
this
leaves
us
where
are
we
for
god
s
sake
where
are
we
first
of
all
he
said
have
you
anything
to
drink
not
for
me
for
yourself
you
look
we
do
not
keep
intoxicants
in
the
oh
piffle
he
said
where
is
it
horace
i
have
a
little
where
i
drew
a
chair
before
the
which
in
our
house
reach
almost
to
the
ceiling
and
withdrawing
a
volume
of
josephus
i
brought
down
the
bottle
now
and
then
when
i
have
had
a
bad
day
i
explained
i
find
that
it
makes
me
he
poured
out
some
and
i
drank
it
being
careful
to
rinse
the
glass
afterward
well
said
sperry
when
he
had
lighted
a
cigar
so
you
want
to
know
where
we
i
would
like
to
save
something
out
of
the
that
s
easy
horace
you
should
be
a
heart
specialist
and
i
should
have
taken
the
law
it
s
as
plain
as
the
he
took
his
notes
of
the
sittings
from
his
pocket
i
m
going
to
read
a
few
things
keep
what
is
left
of
your
mind
on
them
this
is
the
first
sitting
the
knee
hurts
it
is
very
bad
arnica
will
take
the
pain
i
want
to
go
out
i
want
air
if
i
could
only
go
to
sleep
and
forget
it
the
furniture
is
scattered
all
over
the
now
the
second
sitting
it
is
the
stick
it
is
writing
but
the
water
washed
it
away
all
of
it
not
a
if
only
the
pocketbook
were
not
lost
and
letters
it
will
be
terrible
if
the
letters
are
hawkins
may
have
it
the
curtain
was
much
that
part
s
safe
enough
unless
it
made
a
hole
in
the
floor
oh
if
you
re
going
to
read
a
lot
of
irrelevant
material
irrelevant
nothing
wake
up
horace
but
remember
this
i
m
not
explaining
the
physical
phenomena
we
ll
never
do
that
it
wasn
t
extraordinary
as
such
things
go
our
little
medium
in
a
trance
condition
has
read
poor
clara
s
mind
it
s
all
here
all
that
clara
knew
and
nothing
that
she
didn
t
know
a
friend
horace
and
heaven
help
me
when
i
marry
her
as
i
have
said
the
neighborhood
club
ended
its
investigations
with
this
conclusion
which
i
believe
is
properly
reached
it
is
only
fair
to
state
that
there
are
those
among
us
who
have
accepted
that
theory
in
the
wells
case
but
who
have
preferred
to
consider
that
behind
both
it
and
the
physical
phenomena
of
the
seances
there
was
an
intelligence
which
directed
both
an
intelligence
not
of
this
world
as
we
know
it
both
herbert
and
alice
robinson
are
now
pronounced
spiritualists
although
miss
jeremy
now
sperry
has
definitely
abandoned
all
investigative
work
personally
i
have
evolved
no
theory
it
seems
beyond
dispute
that
certain
individuals
can
read
minds
and
that
these
same
or
other
sensitives
are
capable
of
liberating
a
form
of
invisible
energy
which
however
they
turn
to
no
further
account
than
the
useless
ringing
of
bells
moving
of
small
tables
and
flinging
about
of
divers
objects
to
me
i
admit
the
solution
of
the
wells
case
as
one
of
is
more
satisfactory
than
explanatory
for
mental
waves
remain
a
mystery
acknowledged
as
is
electricity
but
of
a
nature
yet
unrevealed
thoughts
are
things
that
is
all
we
know
dane
i
believe
had
suspected
the
solution
from
the
start
the
neighborhood
club
has
recently
disbanded
we
tried
other
things
but
we
had
been
spoiled
our
kipling
winter
was
a
failure
we
read
a
play
or
two
with
sperry
s
wife
reading
the
heroine
and
the
rest
of
us
taking
other
parts
she
has
a
lovely
voice
has
sperry
but
it
was
all
stale
and
unprofitable
after
the
wells
affair
with
herbert
on
a
lecture
tour
on
spirit
realism
and
dane
at
a
sanatorium
for
the
winter
we
have
now
given
it
up
and
my
wife
and
i
spend
our
monday
evenings
at
home
after
dinner
i
read
or
as
lately
i
have
been
making
this
record
of
the
wells
case
from
our
notes
my
wife
is
still
fond
of
the
phonograph
and
even
now
as
i
make
this
last
entry
and
complete
my
narrative
she
is
waiting
for
me
to
change
the
record
i
will
be
frank
i
hate
the
phonograph
i
hope
it
will
be
destroyed
or
stolen
i
am
thinking
very
seriously
of
having
it
stolen
horace
says
my
wife
whatever
would
we
do
without
the
phonograph
i
wish
you
would
put
it
in
the
policy
i
am
always
afraid
it
will
be
even
here
you
see
truly
thoughts
are
things
