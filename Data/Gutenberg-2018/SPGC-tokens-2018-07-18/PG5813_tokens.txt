li
let
me
make
the
superstitions
of
a
nation
and
i
care
not
who
makes
its
laws
or
its
songs
either
wilson
new
calendar
yes
the
city
of
benares
is
in
effect
just
a
big
church
a
religious
hive
whose
every
cell
is
a
temple
a
shrine
or
a
mosque
and
whose
every
conceivable
earthly
and
heavenly
good
is
procurable
under
one
roof
so
to
speak
a
sort
of
army
and
navy
stores
theologically
stocked
i
will
make
out
a
little
itinerary
for
the
pilgrim
then
you
will
see
how
handy
the
system
is
how
convenient
how
comprehensive
if
you
go
to
benares
with
a
serious
desire
to
spiritually
benefit
yourself
you
will
find
it
valuable
i
got
some
of
the
facts
from
conversations
with
the
rev
parker
and
the
others
from
his
guide
to
benares
they
are
therefore
trustworthy
purification
at
sunrise
you
must
go
down
to
the
ganges
and
bathe
pray
and
drink
some
of
the
water
this
is
for
your
general
purification
protection
against
hunger
next
you
must
fortify
yourself
against
the
sorrowful
earthly
ill
just
named
this
you
will
do
by
worshiping
for
a
moment
in
the
cow
temple
by
the
door
of
it
you
will
find
an
image
of
ganesh
son
of
shiva
it
has
the
head
of
an
elephant
on
a
human
body
its
face
and
hands
are
of
silver
you
will
worship
it
a
little
and
pass
on
into
a
covered
veranda
where
you
will
find
devotees
reciting
from
the
sacred
books
with
the
help
of
instructors
in
this
place
are
groups
of
rude
and
dismal
idols
you
may
contribute
something
for
their
support
then
pass
into
the
temple
a
grim
and
stenchy
place
for
it
is
populous
with
sacred
cows
and
with
beggars
you
will
give
something
to
the
beggars
and
reverently
kiss
the
tails
of
such
cows
as
pass
along
for
these
cows
are
peculiarly
holy
and
this
act
of
worship
will
secure
you
from
hunger
for
the
day
the
poor
man
friend
you
will
next
worship
this
god
he
is
at
the
bottom
of
a
stone
cistern
in
the
temple
of
dalbhyeswar
under
the
shade
of
a
noble
peepul
tree
on
the
bluff
overlooking
the
ganges
so
you
must
go
back
to
the
river
the
poor
man
friend
is
the
god
of
material
prosperity
in
general
and
the
god
of
the
rain
in
particular
you
will
secure
material
prosperity
or
both
by
worshiping
him
he
is
shiva
under
a
new
alias
and
he
abides
in
the
bottom
of
that
cistern
in
the
form
of
a
stone
lingam
you
pour
ganges
water
over
him
and
in
return
for
this
homage
you
get
the
promised
benefits
if
there
is
any
delay
about
the
rain
you
must
pour
water
in
until
the
cistern
is
full
the
rain
will
then
be
sure
to
come
fever
at
the
kedar
ghat
you
will
find
a
long
flight
of
stone
steps
leading
down
to
the
river
half
way
down
is
a
tank
filled
with
sewage
drink
as
much
of
it
as
you
want
it
is
for
fever
smallpox
go
straight
from
there
to
the
central
ghat
at
its
upstream
end
you
will
find
a
small
whitewashed
building
which
is
a
temple
sacred
to
sitala
goddess
of
smallpox
her
is
there
a
rude
human
figure
behind
a
brass
screen
you
will
worship
this
for
reasons
to
be
furnished
presently
the
well
of
fate
for
certain
reasons
you
will
next
go
and
do
homage
at
this
well
you
will
find
it
in
the
dandpan
temple
in
the
city
the
sunlight
falls
into
it
from
a
square
hole
in
the
masonry
above
you
will
approach
it
with
awe
for
your
life
is
now
at
stake
you
will
bend
over
and
look
if
the
fates
are
propitious
you
will
see
your
face
pictured
in
the
water
far
down
in
the
well
if
matters
have
been
otherwise
ordered
a
sudden
cloud
will
mask
the
sun
and
you
will
see
nothing
this
means
that
you
have
not
six
months
to
live
if
you
are
already
at
the
point
of
death
your
circumstances
are
now
serious
there
is
no
time
to
lose
let
this
world
go
arrange
for
the
next
one
handily
situated
at
your
very
elbow
is
opportunity
for
this
you
turn
and
worship
the
image
of
maha
kal
the
great
fate
and
happiness
in
the
life
to
come
is
secured
if
there
is
breath
in
your
body
yet
you
should
now
make
an
effort
to
get
a
further
lease
of
the
present
life
you
have
a
chance
there
is
a
chance
for
everything
in
this
admirably
stocked
and
wonderfully
systemized
spiritual
and
temporal
army
and
navy
store
you
must
get
yourself
carried
to
the
well
of
long
life
this
is
within
the
precincts
of
the
mouldering
and
venerable
briddhkal
temple
which
is
one
of
the
oldest
in
benares
you
pass
in
by
a
stone
image
of
the
monkey
god
hanuman
and
there
among
the
ruined
courtyards
you
will
find
a
shallow
pool
of
stagnant
sewage
it
smells
like
the
best
limburger
cheese
and
is
filthy
with
the
washings
of
rotting
lepers
but
that
is
nothing
bathe
in
it
bathe
in
it
gratefully
and
worshipfully
for
this
is
the
fountain
of
youth
these
are
the
waters
of
long
life
your
gray
hairs
will
disappear
and
with
them
your
wrinkles
and
your
rheumatism
the
burdens
of
care
and
the
weariness
of
age
and
you
will
come
out
young
fresh
elastic
and
full
of
eagerness
for
the
new
race
of
life
now
will
come
flooding
upon
you
the
manifold
desires
that
haunt
the
dear
dreams
of
the
morning
of
life
you
will
go
whither
you
will
find
fulfillment
of
desire
to
wit
to
the
kameshwar
temple
sacred
to
shiva
as
the
lord
of
desires
arrange
for
yours
there
and
if
you
like
to
look
at
idols
among
the
pack
and
jam
of
temples
there
you
will
find
enough
to
stock
a
museum
you
will
begin
to
commit
sins
now
with
a
fresh
new
vivacity
therefore
it
will
be
well
to
go
frequently
to
a
place
where
you
can
get
temporary
cleansing
from
sin
to
wit
to
the
well
of
the
earring
you
must
approach
this
with
the
profoundest
reverence
for
it
is
unutterably
sacred
it
is
indeed
the
most
sacred
place
in
benares
the
very
holy
of
holies
in
the
estimation
of
the
people
it
is
a
railed
tank
with
stone
stairways
leading
down
to
the
water
the
water
is
not
clean
of
course
it
could
not
be
for
people
are
always
bathing
in
it
as
long
as
you
choose
to
stand
and
look
you
will
see
the
files
of
sinners
descending
and
ascending
descending
soiled
with
sin
ascending
purged
from
it
the
liar
the
thief
the
murderer
and
the
adulterer
may
here
wash
and
be
clean
says
the
rev
parker
in
his
book
very
well
i
know
parker
and
i
believe
it
but
if
anybody
else
had
said
it
i
should
consider
him
a
person
who
had
better
go
down
in
the
tank
and
take
another
wash
the
god
vishnu
dug
this
tank
he
had
nothing
to
dig
with
but
his
discus
i
do
not
know
what
a
discus
is
but
i
know
it
is
a
poor
thing
to
dig
tanks
with
because
by
the
time
this
one
was
finished
it
was
full
of
sweat
vishnu
sweat
he
constructed
the
site
that
benares
stands
on
and
afterward
built
the
globe
around
it
and
thought
nothing
of
it
yet
sweated
like
that
over
a
little
thing
like
this
tank
one
of
these
statements
is
doubtful
i
do
not
know
which
one
it
is
but
i
think
it
difficult
not
to
believe
that
a
god
who
could
build
a
world
around
benares
would
not
be
intelligent
enough
to
build
it
around
the
tank
too
and
not
have
to
dig
it
youth
long
life
temporary
purification
from
sin
salvation
through
propitiation
of
the
great
fate
these
are
all
good
but
you
must
do
something
more
you
must
make
salvation
sure
there
are
several
ways
to
get
drowned
in
the
ganges
is
one
but
that
is
not
pleasant
to
die
within
the
limits
of
benares
is
another
but
that
is
a
risky
one
because
you
might
be
out
of
town
when
your
time
came
the
best
one
of
all
is
the
pilgrimage
around
the
city
you
must
walk
also
you
must
go
barefoot
the
tramp
is
miles
for
the
road
winds
out
into
the
country
a
piece
and
you
will
be
marching
five
or
six
days
but
you
will
have
plenty
of
company
you
will
move
with
throngs
and
hosts
of
happy
pilgrims
whose
radiant
costumes
will
make
the
spectacle
beautiful
and
whose
glad
songs
and
holy
pans
of
triumph
will
banish
your
fatigues
and
cheer
your
spirit
and
at
intervals
there
will
be
temples
where
you
may
sleep
and
be
refreshed
with
food
the
pilgrimage
completed
you
have
purchased
salvation
and
paid
for
it
but
you
may
not
get
it
unless
you
get
your
redemption
recorded
you
can
get
this
done
at
the
sakhi
binayak
temple
and
it
is
best
to
do
it
for
otherwise
you
might
not
be
able
to
prove
that
you
had
made
the
pilgrimage
in
case
the
matter
should
some
day
come
to
be
disputed
that
temple
is
in
a
lane
back
of
the
cow
temple
over
the
door
is
a
red
image
of
ganesh
of
the
elephant
head
son
and
heir
of
shiva
and
prince
of
wales
to
the
theological
monarchy
so
to
speak
within
is
a
god
whose
office
it
is
to
record
your
pilgrimage
and
be
responsible
for
you
you
will
not
see
him
but
you
will
see
a
brahmin
who
will
attend
to
the
matter
and
take
the
money
if
he
should
forget
to
collect
the
money
you
can
remind
him
he
knows
that
your
salvation
is
now
secure
but
of
course
you
would
like
to
know
it
yourself
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
go
and
pray
and
pay
at
the
well
of
the
knowledge
of
salvation
it
is
close
to
the
golden
temple
there
you
will
see
sculptured
out
of
a
single
piece
of
black
marble
a
bull
which
is
much
larger
than
any
living
bull
you
have
ever
seen
and
yet
is
not
a
good
likeness
after
all
and
there
also
you
will
see
a
very
uncommon
thing
an
image
of
shiva
you
have
seen
his
lingam
fifty
thousand
times
already
but
this
is
shiva
himself
and
said
to
be
a
good
likeness
it
has
three
eyes
he
is
the
only
god
in
the
firm
that
has
three
the
well
is
covered
by
a
fine
canopy
of
stone
supported
by
forty
pillars
and
around
it
you
will
find
what
you
have
already
seen
at
almost
every
shrine
you
have
visited
in
benares
a
mob
of
devout
and
eager
pilgrims
the
sacred
water
is
being
ladled
out
to
them
with
it
comes
to
them
the
knowledge
clear
thrilling
absolute
that
they
are
saved
and
you
can
see
by
their
faces
that
there
is
one
happiness
in
this
world
which
is
supreme
and
to
which
no
other
joy
is
comparable
you
receive
your
water
you
make
your
deposit
and
now
what
more
would
you
have
gold
diamonds
power
fame
all
in
a
single
moment
these
things
have
withered
to
dirt
dust
ashes
the
world
has
nothing
to
give
you
now
for
you
it
is
bankrupt
i
do
not
claim
that
the
pilgrims
do
their
acts
of
worship
in
the
order
and
sequence
above
charted
out
in
this
itinerary
of
mine
but
i
think
logic
suggests
that
they
ought
to
do
so
instead
of
a
worship
we
then
have
a
definite
and
a
march
which
carries
the
pilgrim
steadily
forward
by
reasoned
and
logical
progression
to
a
definite
goal
thus
his
ganges
bath
in
the
early
morning
gives
him
an
appetite
he
kisses
the
and
that
removes
it
it
is
now
business
hours
and
longings
for
material
prosperity
rise
in
his
mind
and
be
goes
and
pours
water
over
shiva
symbol
this
insures
the
prosperity
but
also
brings
on
a
rain
which
gives
him
a
fever
then
he
drinks
the
sewage
at
the
kedar
ghat
to
cure
the
fever
it
cures
the
fever
but
gives
him
the
smallpox
he
wishes
to
know
how
it
is
going
to
turn
out
he
goes
to
the
dandpan
temple
and
looks
down
the
well
a
clouded
sun
shows
him
that
death
is
near
logically
his
best
course
for
the
present
since
he
can
not
tell
at
what
moment
he
may
die
is
to
secure
a
happy
hereafter
this
he
does
through
the
agency
of
the
great
fate
he
is
safe
now
for
heaven
his
next
move
will
naturally
be
to
keep
out
of
it
as
long
as
he
can
therefore
he
goes
to
the
briddhkal
temple
and
secures
youth
and
long
life
by
bathing
in
a
puddle
of
which
would
kill
a
microbe
logically
youth
has
him
for
sin
and
with
the
disposition
to
commit
it
he
will
naturally
go
to
the
fane
which
is
consecrated
to
the
fulfillment
of
desires
and
make
arrangements
logically
he
will
now
go
to
the
well
of
the
earring
from
time
to
time
to
unload
and
freshen
up
for
further
banned
enjoyments
but
first
and
last
and
all
the
time
he
is
human
and
therefore
in
his
reflective
intervals
he
will
always
be
speculating
in
futures
he
will
make
the
great
pilgrimage
around
the
city
and
so
make
his
salvation
absolutely
sure
he
will
also
have
record
made
of
it
so
that
it
may
remain
absolutely
sure
and
not
be
forgotten
or
repudiated
in
the
confusion
of
the
final
settlement
logically
also
he
will
wish
to
have
satisfying
and
tranquilizing
personal
knowledge
that
that
salvation
is
secure
therefore
he
goes
to
the
well
of
the
knowledge
of
salvation
adds
that
completing
detail
and
then
goes
about
his
affairs
serene
and
content
serene
and
content
for
he
is
now
royally
endowed
with
an
advantage
which
no
religion
in
this
world
could
give
him
but
his
own
for
henceforth
he
may
commit
as
many
million
sins
as
he
wants
to
and
nothing
can
come
of
it
thus
the
system
properly
and
logically
ordered
is
neat
compact
clearly
defined
and
covers
the
whole
ground
i
desire
to
recommend
it
to
such
as
find
the
other
systems
too
difficult
exacting
and
irksome
for
the
uses
of
this
fretful
brief
life
of
ours
however
let
me
not
deceive
any
one
my
itinerary
lacks
a
detail
i
must
put
it
in
the
truth
is
that
after
the
pilgrim
has
faithfully
followed
the
requirements
of
the
itinerary
through
to
the
end
and
has
secured
his
salvation
and
also
the
personal
knowledge
of
that
fact
there
is
still
an
accident
possible
to
him
which
can
annul
the
whole
thing
if
he
should
ever
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
ganges
and
get
caught
out
and
die
there
he
would
at
once
come
to
life
again
in
the
form
of
an
ass
think
of
that
after
all
this
trouble
and
expense
you
see
how
capricious
and
uncertain
salvation
is
there
the
hindoo
has
a
childish
and
unreasoning
aversion
to
being
turned
into
an
ass
it
is
hard
to
tell
why
one
could
properly
expect
an
ass
to
have
an
aversion
to
being
turned
into
a
hindoo
one
could
understand
that
he
could
lose
dignity
by
it
also
and
of
his
intelligence
but
the
hindoo
changed
into
an
ass
would
lose
anything
unless
you
count
his
religion
and
he
would
gain
much
release
from
his
slavery
to
two
million
gods
and
twenty
million
priests
fakeers
holy
mendicants
and
other
sacred
bacilli
he
would
escape
the
hindoo
hell
he
would
also
escape
the
hindoo
heaven
these
are
advantages
which
the
hindoo
ought
to
consider
then
he
would
go
over
and
die
on
the
other
side
benares
is
a
religious
vesuvius
in
its
bowels
the
theological
forces
have
been
heaving
and
tossing
rumbling
thundering
and
quaking
boiling
and
weltering
and
flaming
and
smoking
for
ages
but
a
little
group
of
missionaries
have
taken
post
at
its
base
and
they
have
hopes
there
are
the
baptist
missionary
society
the
church
missionary
society
the
london
missionary
society
the
wesleyan
missionary
society
and
the
zenana
bible
and
medical
mission
they
have
schools
and
the
principal
work
seems
to
be
among
the
children
and
no
doubt
that
part
of
the
work
prospers
best
for
grown
people
everywhere
are
always
likely
to
cling
to
the
religion
they
were
brought
up
in
chapter
lii
wrinkles
should
merely
indicate
where
smiles
have
been
wilson
new
calendar
in
one
of
those
benares
temples
we
saw
a
devotee
working
for
salvation
in
a
curious
way
he
had
a
huge
wad
of
clay
beside
him
and
was
making
it
up
into
little
wee
gods
no
bigger
than
carpet
tacks
he
stuck
a
grain
of
rice
into
each
to
represent
the
lingam
i
think
he
turned
them
out
nimbly
for
he
had
had
long
practice
and
had
acquired
great
facility
every
day
he
made
gods
then
threw
them
into
the
holy
ganges
this
act
of
homage
brought
him
the
profound
homage
of
the
pious
also
their
coppers
he
had
a
sure
living
here
and
was
earning
a
high
place
in
the
hereafter
the
ganges
front
is
the
supreme
of
benares
its
tall
bluffs
are
solidly
caked
from
water
to
summit
along
a
stretch
of
three
miles
with
a
splendid
jumble
of
massive
and
picturesque
masonry
a
bewildering
and
beautiful
confusion
of
stone
platforms
temples
rich
and
stately
palaces
nowhere
a
break
nowhere
a
glimpse
of
the
bluff
itself
all
the
long
face
of
it
is
compactly
walled
from
sight
by
this
crammed
perspective
of
platforms
soaring
stairways
sculptured
temples
majestic
palaces
softening
away
into
the
distances
and
there
is
movement
motion
human
life
everywhere
and
brilliantly
costumed
streaming
in
rainbows
up
and
down
the
lofty
stairways
and
massed
in
metaphorical
on
the
miles
of
great
platforms
at
the
river
edge
all
this
masonry
all
this
architecture
represents
piety
the
palaces
were
built
by
native
princes
whose
homes
as
a
rule
are
far
from
benares
but
who
go
there
from
time
to
time
to
refresh
their
souls
with
the
sight
and
touch
of
the
ganges
the
river
of
their
idolatry
the
stairways
are
records
of
acts
of
piety
the
crowd
of
costly
little
temples
are
tokens
of
money
spent
by
rich
men
for
present
credit
and
hope
of
future
reward
apparently
the
rich
christian
who
spends
large
sums
upon
his
religion
is
conspicuous
with
us
by
his
rarity
but
the
rich
hindoo
who
does
spend
large
sums
upon
his
religion
is
seemingly
with
us
the
poor
spend
money
on
their
religion
but
they
keep
back
some
to
live
on
apparently
in
india
the
poor
bankrupt
themselves
daily
for
their
religion
the
rich
hindoo
can
afford
his
pious
outlays
he
gets
much
glory
for
his
spendings
yet
keeps
back
a
sufficiency
of
his
income
for
temporal
purposes
but
the
poor
hindoo
is
entitled
to
compassion
for
his
spendings
keep
him
poor
yet
get
him
no
glory
we
made
the
usual
trip
up
and
down
the
river
seated
in
chairs
under
an
awning
on
the
deck
of
the
usual
commodious
ark
made
it
two
or
three
times
and
could
have
made
it
with
increasing
interest
and
enjoyment
many
times
more
for
of
course
the
palaces
and
temples
would
grow
more
and
more
beautiful
every
time
one
saw
them
for
that
happens
with
all
such
things
also
i
think
one
would
not
get
tired
of
the
bathers
nor
their
costumes
nor
of
their
ingenuities
in
getting
out
of
them
and
into
them
again
without
exposing
too
much
bronze
nor
of
their
devotional
gesticulations
and
absorbed
but
i
should
get
tired
of
seeing
them
wash
their
mouths
with
that
dreadful
water
and
drink
it
in
fact
i
did
get
tired
of
it
and
very
early
too
at
one
place
where
we
halted
for
a
while
the
foul
gush
from
a
sewer
was
making
the
water
turbid
and
murky
all
around
and
there
was
a
random
corpse
slopping
around
in
it
that
had
floated
down
from
up
country
ten
steps
below
that
place
stood
a
crowd
of
men
women
and
comely
young
maidens
waist
deep
in
the
they
were
scooping
it
up
in
their
hands
and
drinking
it
faith
can
certainly
do
wonders
and
this
is
an
instance
of
it
those
people
were
not
drinking
that
fearful
stuff
to
assuage
thirst
but
in
order
to
purify
their
souls
and
the
interior
of
their
bodies
according
to
their
creed
the
ganges
water
makes
everything
pure
that
it
touches
instantly
and
utterly
pure
the
sewer
water
was
not
an
offence
to
them
the
corpse
did
not
revolt
them
the
sacred
water
had
touched
both
and
both
were
now
and
could
defile
no
one
the
memory
of
that
sight
will
always
stay
by
me
but
not
by
request
a
word
further
concerning
the
nasty
but
ganges
water
when
we
went
to
agra
by
and
by
we
happened
there
just
in
time
to
be
in
at
the
birth
of
a
marvel
a
memorable
scientific
discovery
the
discovery
that
in
certain
ways
the
foul
and
derided
ganges
water
is
the
most
puissant
purifier
in
the
world
this
curious
fact
as
i
have
said
had
just
been
added
to
the
treasury
of
modern
science
it
had
long
been
noted
as
a
strange
thing
that
while
benares
is
often
afflicted
with
the
cholera
she
does
not
spread
it
beyond
her
borders
this
could
not
be
accounted
for
henkin
the
scientist
in
the
employ
of
the
government
of
agra
concluded
to
examine
the
water
he
went
to
benares
and
made
his
tests
he
got
water
at
the
mouths
of
the
sewers
where
they
empty
into
the
river
at
the
bathing
ghats
a
cubic
centimetre
of
it
contained
millions
of
germs
at
the
end
of
six
hours
they
were
all
dead
he
caught
a
floating
corpse
towed
it
to
the
shore
and
from
beside
it
he
dipped
up
water
that
was
swarming
with
cholera
germs
at
the
end
of
six
hours
they
were
all
dead
he
added
swarm
after
swarm
of
cholera
germs
to
this
water
within
the
six
hours
they
always
died
to
the
last
sample
repeatedly
he
took
pure
well
water
which
was
bare
of
animal
life
and
put
into
it
a
few
cholera
germs
they
always
began
to
propagate
at
once
and
always
within
six
hours
they
swarmed
and
were
numberable
by
millions
upon
millions
for
ages
and
ages
the
hindoos
have
had
absolute
faith
that
the
water
of
the
ganges
was
absolutely
pure
could
not
be
defiled
by
any
contact
whatsoever
and
infallibly
made
pure
and
clean
whatsoever
thing
touched
it
they
still
believe
it
and
that
is
why
they
bathe
in
it
and
drink
it
caring
nothing
for
its
seeming
filthiness
and
the
floating
corpses
the
hindoos
have
been
laughed
at
these
many
generations
but
the
laughter
will
need
to
modify
itself
a
little
from
now
on
how
did
they
find
out
the
water
secret
in
those
ancient
ages
had
they
then
we
do
not
know
we
only
know
that
they
had
a
civilization
long
before
we
emerged
from
savagery
but
to
return
to
where
i
was
before
i
was
about
to
speak
of
the
they
do
not
burn
fakeers
those
revered
mendicants
they
are
so
holy
that
they
can
get
to
their
place
without
that
sacrament
provided
they
be
consigned
to
the
consecrating
river
we
saw
one
carried
to
and
thrown
overboard
he
was
sandwiched
between
two
great
slabs
of
stone
we
lay
off
the
half
an
hour
and
saw
nine
corpses
burned
i
should
not
wish
to
see
any
more
of
it
unless
i
might
select
the
parties
the
mourners
follow
the
bier
through
the
town
and
down
to
the
ghat
then
the
deliver
the
body
to
some
natives
doms
and
the
mourners
turn
about
and
go
back
home
i
heard
no
crying
and
saw
no
tears
there
was
no
ceremony
of
parting
apparently
these
expressions
of
grief
and
affection
are
reserved
for
the
privacy
of
the
home
the
dead
women
came
draped
in
red
the
men
in
white
they
are
laid
in
the
water
at
the
river
edge
while
the
pyre
is
being
prepared
the
first
subject
was
a
man
when
the
doms
unswathed
him
to
wash
him
he
proved
to
be
a
sturdily
built
and
handsome
old
gentleman
with
not
a
sign
about
him
to
suggest
that
he
had
ever
been
dry
wood
was
brought
and
built
up
into
a
loose
pile
the
corpse
was
laid
upon
it
and
covered
over
with
fuel
then
a
naked
holy
man
who
was
sitting
on
high
ground
a
little
distance
away
began
to
talk
and
shout
with
great
energy
and
he
kept
up
this
noise
right
along
it
may
have
been
the
funeral
sermon
and
probably
was
i
forgot
to
say
that
one
of
the
mourners
remained
behind
when
the
others
went
away
this
was
the
dead
man
son
a
boy
of
ten
or
twelve
brown
and
handsome
grave
and
and
clothed
in
flowing
white
he
was
there
to
burn
his
father
he
was
given
a
torch
and
while
he
slowly
walked
seven
times
around
the
pyre
the
naked
black
man
on
the
high
ground
poured
out
his
sermon
more
clamorously
than
ever
the
seventh
circuit
completed
the
boy
applied
the
torch
at
his
father
head
then
at
his
feet
the
flames
sprang
briskly
up
with
a
sharp
crackling
noise
and
the
lad
went
away
hindoos
do
not
want
daughters
because
their
weddings
make
such
a
ruinous
expense
but
they
want
sons
so
that
at
death
they
may
have
honorable
exit
from
the
world
and
there
is
no
honor
equal
to
the
honor
of
having
one
pyre
lighted
by
one
son
the
father
who
dies
sonless
is
in
a
grievous
situation
indeed
and
is
pitied
life
being
uncertain
the
hindoo
marries
while
he
is
still
a
boy
in
the
hope
that
he
will
have
a
son
ready
when
the
day
of
his
need
shall
come
but
if
he
have
no
son
he
will
adopt
one
this
answers
every
purpose
meantime
the
corpse
is
burning
also
several
others
it
is
a
dismal
business
the
stokers
did
not
sit
down
in
idleness
but
moved
briskly
about
punching
up
the
fires
with
long
poles
and
now
and
then
adding
fuel
sometimes
they
hoisted
the
half
of
a
skeleton
into
the
air
then
slammed
it
down
and
beat
it
with
the
pole
breaking
it
up
so
that
it
would
burn
better
they
hoisted
skulls
up
in
the
same
way
and
banged
and
battered
them
the
sight
was
hard
to
bear
it
would
have
been
harder
if
the
mourners
had
stayed
to
witness
it
i
had
but
a
moderate
desire
to
see
a
cremation
so
it
was
soon
satisfied
for
sanitary
reasons
it
would
be
well
if
cremation
were
universal
but
this
form
is
revolting
and
not
to
be
recommended
the
fire
used
is
sacred
of
course
for
there
is
money
in
it
ordinary
fire
is
forbidden
there
is
no
money
in
it
i
was
told
that
this
sacred
fire
is
all
furnished
by
one
person
and
that
he
has
a
monopoly
of
it
and
charges
a
good
price
for
it
sometimes
a
rich
mourner
pays
a
thousand
rupees
for
it
to
get
to
paradise
from
india
is
an
expensive
thing
every
detail
connected
with
the
matter
costs
something
and
helps
to
fatten
a
priest
i
suppose
it
is
quite
safe
to
conclude
that
that
is
in
holy
orders
close
to
the
stand
a
few
stones
which
are
remembrances
of
the
suttee
each
has
a
rough
carving
upon
it
representing
a
man
and
a
woman
standing
or
walking
hand
in
hand
and
marks
the
spot
where
a
widow
went
to
her
death
by
fire
in
the
days
when
the
suttee
flourished
parker
said
that
widows
would
burn
themselves
now
if
the
government
would
allow
it
the
family
that
can
point
to
one
of
these
little
memorials
and
say
she
who
burned
herself
there
was
an
ancestress
of
ours
is
envied
it
is
a
curious
people
with
them
all
life
seems
to
be
sacred
except
human
life
even
the
life
of
vermin
is
sacred
and
must
not
be
taken
the
good
jain
wipes
off
a
seat
before
using
it
lest
he
cause
the
death
valueless
insect
by
sitting
down
on
it
it
grieves
him
to
have
to
drink
water
because
the
provisions
in
his
stomach
may
not
agree
with
the
microbes
yet
india
invented
thuggery
and
the
suttee
india
is
a
hard
country
to
understand
we
went
to
the
temple
of
the
thug
goddess
bhowanee
or
kali
or
durga
she
has
these
names
and
others
she
is
the
only
god
to
whom
living
sacrifices
are
made
goats
are
sacrificed
to
her
monkeys
would
be
cheaper
there
are
plenty
of
them
about
the
place
being
sacred
they
make
themselves
very
free
and
scramble
around
wherever
they
please
the
temple
and
its
porch
are
beautifully
carved
but
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
idol
bhowanee
is
not
pleasant
to
look
at
she
has
a
silver
face
and
a
projecting
swollen
tongue
painted
a
deep
red
she
wears
a
necklace
of
skulls
in
fact
none
of
the
idols
in
benares
are
handsome
or
attractive
and
what
a
swarm
of
them
there
is
the
town
is
a
vast
museum
of
idols
and
all
of
them
crude
misshapen
and
ugly
they
flock
through
one
dreams
at
night
a
wild
mob
of
nightmares
when
you
get
tired
of
them
in
the
temples
and
take
a
trip
on
the
river
you
find
idol
giants
flashily
painted
stretched
out
side
by
side
on
the
shore
and
apparently
wherever
there
is
room
for
one
more
lingam
a
lingam
is
there
if
vishnu
had
foreseen
what
his
town
was
going
to
be
he
would
have
called
it
idolville
or
lingamburg
the
most
conspicuous
feature
of
benares
is
the
pair
of
slender
white
minarets
which
tower
like
masts
from
the
great
mosque
of
aurangzeb
they
seem
to
be
always
in
sight
from
everywhere
those
airy
graceful
inspiring
things
but
masts
is
not
the
right
word
for
masts
have
a
perceptible
taper
while
these
minarets
have
not
they
are
feet
high
and
only
feet
in
diameter
at
the
base
and
at
the
summit
scarcely
any
taper
at
all
these
are
the
proportions
of
a
candle
and
fair
and
fairylike
candles
these
are
will
be
anyway
some
day
when
the
christians
inherit
them
and
top
them
with
the
electric
light
there
is
a
great
view
from
up
there
a
wonderful
view
a
large
gray
monkey
was
part
of
it
and
damaged
it
a
monkey
has
no
judgment
this
one
was
skipping
about
the
upper
great
heights
of
the
mosque
skipping
across
empty
yawning
intervals
which
were
almost
too
wide
for
him
and
which
he
only
just
barely
cleared
each
time
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
he
got
me
so
nervous
that
i
could
look
at
the
view
i
could
look
at
anything
but
him
every
time
he
went
sailing
over
one
of
those
abysses
my
breath
stood
still
and
when
he
grabbed
for
the
perch
he
was
going
for
i
grabbed
too
in
sympathy
and
he
was
perfectly
indifferent
perfectly
unconcerned
and
i
did
all
the
panting
myself
he
came
within
an
ace
of
losing
his
life
a
dozen
times
and
i
was
so
troubled
about
him
that
i
would
have
shot
him
if
i
had
had
anything
to
do
it
with
but
i
strongly
recommend
the
view
there
is
more
monkey
than
view
and
there
is
always
going
to
be
more
monkey
while
that
idiot
survives
but
what
view
you
get
is
superb
all
benares
the
river
and
the
region
round
about
are
spread
before
you
take
a
gun
and
look
at
the
view
the
next
thing
i
saw
was
more
reposeful
it
was
a
new
kind
of
art
it
was
a
picture
painted
on
water
it
was
done
by
a
native
he
sprinkled
fine
dust
of
various
colors
on
the
still
surface
of
a
basin
of
water
and
out
of
these
sprinklings
a
dainty
and
pretty
picture
gradually
grew
a
picture
which
a
breath
could
destroy
somehow
it
was
impressive
after
so
much
browsing
among
massive
and
battered
and
decaying
fanes
that
rest
upon
ruins
and
those
ruins
upon
still
other
ruins
and
those
upon
still
others
again
it
was
a
sermon
an
allegory
a
symbol
of
instability
those
creations
in
stone
were
only
a
kind
of
water
pictures
after
all
a
prominent
episode
in
the
indian
career
of
warren
hastings
had
benares
for
its
theater
wherever
that
extraordinary
man
set
his
foot
he
left
his
mark
he
came
to
benares
in
to
collect
a
fine
of
which
he
had
levied
upon
its
rajah
cheit
singly
on
behalf
of
the
east
india
company
hastings
was
a
long
way
from
home
and
help
there
were
probably
not
a
dozen
englishmen
within
reach
the
rajah
was
in
his
fort
with
his
myriads
around
him
but
no
matter
from
his
little
camp
in
a
neighboring
garden
hastings
sent
a
party
to
arrest
the
sovereign
he
sent
on
this
daring
mission
a
couple
of
hundred
native
soldiers
sepoys
under
command
of
three
young
english
lieutenants
the
rajah
submitted
without
a
word
the
incident
lights
up
the
indian
situation
electrically
and
gives
one
a
vivid
sense
of
the
strides
which
the
english
had
made
and
the
mastership
they
had
acquired
in
the
land
since
the
date
of
clive
great
victory
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
from
being
nobodies
and
feared
by
none
they
were
become
confessed
lords
and
masters
feared
by
all
sovereigns
included
and
served
by
all
sovereigns
included
it
makes
the
fairy
tales
sound
true
the
english
had
not
been
afraid
to
enlist
native
soldiers
to
fight
against
their
own
people
and
keep
them
obedient
and
now
hastings
was
not
afraid
to
come
away
out
to
this
remote
place
with
a
handful
of
such
soldiers
and
send
them
to
arrest
a
native
sovereign
the
lieutenants
imprisoned
the
rajah
in
his
own
fort
it
was
beautiful
the
pluckiness
of
it
the
impudence
of
it
the
arrest
enraged
the
rajah
people
and
all
benares
came
storming
about
the
place
and
threatening
vengeance
and
yet
but
for
an
accident
nothing
important
would
have
resulted
perhaps
the
mob
found
out
a
most
strange
thing
an
almost
incredible
thing
that
this
handful
of
soldiers
had
come
on
this
hardy
errand
with
empty
guns
and
no
ammunition
this
has
been
attributed
to
thoughtlessness
but
it
could
hardly
have
been
that
for
in
such
large
emergencies
as
this
intelligent
people
do
think
it
must
have
been
indifference
an
born
of
the
proved
submissiveness
of
the
native
character
when
confronted
by
even
one
or
two
stern
britons
in
their
war
paint
but
however
that
may
be
it
was
a
fatal
discovery
that
the
mob
had
made
they
were
full
of
courage
now
and
they
broke
into
the
fort
and
massacred
the
helpless
soldiers
and
their
officers
hastings
escaped
from
benares
by
night
and
got
safely
away
leaving
the
principality
in
a
state
of
wild
insurrection
but
he
was
back
again
within
the
month
and
quieted
it
down
in
his
prompt
and
virile
way
and
took
the
rajah
throne
away
from
him
and
gave
it
to
another
man
he
was
a
capable
kind
of
person
was
warren
hastings
this
was
the
only
time
he
was
ever
out
of
ammunition
some
of
his
acts
have
left
stains
upon
his
name
which
can
never
be
washed
away
but
he
saved
to
england
the
indian
empire
and
that
was
the
best
service
that
was
ever
done
to
the
indians
themselves
those
wretched
heirs
of
a
hundred
centuries
of
pitiless
oppression
and
abuse
chapter
liii
true
irreverence
is
disrespect
for
another
man
god
wilson
new
calendar
it
was
in
benares
that
i
saw
another
living
god
that
makes
two
i
believe
i
have
seen
most
of
the
greater
and
lesser
wonders
of
the
world
but
i
do
not
remember
that
any
of
them
interested
me
so
overwhelmingly
as
did
that
pair
of
gods
when
i
try
to
account
for
this
effect
i
find
no
difficulty
about
it
i
find
that
as
a
rule
when
a
thing
is
a
wonder
to
us
it
is
not
because
of
what
we
see
in
it
but
because
of
what
others
have
seen
in
it
we
get
almost
all
our
wonders
at
second
hand
we
are
eager
to
see
any
celebrated
thing
and
we
never
fail
of
our
reward
just
the
deep
privilege
of
gazing
upon
an
object
which
has
stirred
the
enthusiasm
or
evoked
the
reverence
or
affection
or
admiration
of
multitudes
of
our
race
is
a
thing
which
we
value
we
are
profoundly
glad
that
we
have
seen
it
we
are
permanently
enriched
from
having
seen
it
we
would
not
part
with
the
memory
of
that
experience
for
a
great
price
and
yet
that
very
spectacle
may
be
the
taj
you
can
not
keep
your
enthusiasms
down
you
can
not
keep
your
emotions
within
bounds
when
that
soaring
bubble
of
marble
breaks
upon
your
view
but
these
are
not
your
enthusiasms
and
emotions
they
are
the
accumulated
emotions
and
enthusiasms
of
a
thousand
fervid
writers
who
have
been
slowly
and
steadily
storing
them
up
in
your
heart
day
by
day
and
year
by
year
all
your
life
and
now
they
burst
out
in
a
flood
and
overwhelm
you
and
you
could
not
be
a
whit
happier
if
they
were
your
very
own
by
and
by
you
sober
down
and
then
you
perceive
that
you
have
been
drunk
on
the
smell
of
somebody
else
cork
for
ever
and
ever
the
memory
of
my
distant
first
glimpse
of
the
taj
will
compensate
me
for
creeping
around
the
globe
to
have
that
great
privilege
but
the
taj
with
all
your
inflation
of
delusive
emotions
acquired
at
from
people
to
whom
in
the
majority
of
cases
they
were
also
delusions
acquired
at
a
thing
which
you
fortunately
did
not
think
of
or
it
might
have
made
you
doubtful
of
what
you
imagined
were
your
own
what
is
the
taj
as
a
marvel
a
spectacle
and
an
uplifting
and
overpowering
wonder
compared
with
a
living
breathing
speaking
personage
whom
several
millions
of
human
beings
devoutly
and
sincerely
and
unquestioningly
believe
to
be
a
god
and
humbly
and
gratefully
worship
as
a
god
he
was
sixty
years
old
when
i
saw
him
he
is
called
sri
swami
bhaskarananda
saraswati
that
is
one
form
of
it
i
think
that
that
is
what
you
would
call
him
in
speaking
to
him
because
it
is
short
but
you
would
use
more
of
his
name
in
addressing
a
letter
to
him
courtesy
would
require
this
even
then
you
would
not
have
to
use
all
of
it
but
only
this
much
sri
matparamahansrzpairivrajakacharyaswamibhaskaranandasaraswati
you
do
not
put
esq
after
it
for
that
is
not
necessary
the
word
which
opens
the
volley
is
itself
a
title
of
honor
sri
the
stands
for
the
rest
of
his
names
i
believe
vishnu
has
names
which
he
does
not
use
in
business
and
no
doubt
it
is
a
custom
of
gods
and
a
privilege
sacred
to
their
order
to
keep
extra
ones
in
stock
just
the
restricted
name
set
down
above
is
a
handsome
property
without
the
by
my
count
it
has
letters
in
it
this
removes
the
long
german
words
from
competition
they
are
permanently
out
of
the
race
sri
saraswati
has
attained
to
what
among
the
hindoos
is
called
the
state
of
perfection
it
is
a
state
which
other
hindoos
reach
by
being
born
again
and
again
and
over
and
over
again
into
this
world
through
one
after
another
a
tiresome
long
job
covering
centuries
and
decades
of
centuries
and
one
that
is
full
of
risks
too
like
the
accident
of
dying
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
ganges
some
time
or
other
and
waking
up
in
the
form
of
an
ass
with
a
fresh
start
necessary
and
the
numerous
trips
to
be
made
all
over
again
but
in
reaching
perfection
sri
has
escaped
all
that
he
is
no
longer
a
part
or
a
feature
of
this
world
his
substance
has
changed
all
earthiness
has
departed
out
of
it
he
is
utterly
holy
utterly
pure
nothing
can
desecrate
this
holiness
or
stain
this
purity
he
is
no
longer
of
the
earth
its
concerns
are
matters
foreign
to
him
its
pains
and
griefs
and
troubles
can
not
reach
him
when
he
dies
nirvana
is
his
he
will
be
absorbed
into
the
substance
of
the
supreme
deity
and
be
at
peace
forever
the
hindoo
scriptures
point
out
how
this
state
is
to
be
reached
but
it
is
only
once
in
a
thousand
years
perhaps
that
candidate
accomplishes
it
this
one
has
traversed
the
course
required
stage
by
stage
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
and
now
has
nothing
left
to
do
but
wait
for
the
call
which
shall
release
him
from
a
world
in
which
he
has
now
no
part
nor
lot
first
he
passed
through
the
student
stage
and
became
learned
in
the
holy
books
next
he
became
citizen
householder
husband
and
father
that
was
the
required
second
stage
then
like
john
christian
he
bade
perpetual
to
his
family
as
required
and
went
wandering
away
he
went
far
into
the
desert
and
served
a
term
as
hermit
next
he
became
a
beggar
in
accordance
with
the
rites
laid
down
in
the
scriptures
and
wandered
about
india
eating
the
bread
of
mendicancy
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
he
reached
the
stage
of
purity
this
needs
no
garment
its
symbol
is
nudity
he
discarded
the
which
he
had
previously
worn
he
could
resume
it
now
if
he
chose
for
neither
that
nor
any
other
contact
can
defile
him
but
he
does
not
choose
there
are
several
other
stages
i
believe
but
i
do
not
remember
what
they
are
but
he
has
been
through
them
throughout
the
long
course
he
was
perfecting
himself
in
holy
learning
and
writing
commentaries
upon
the
sacred
books
he
was
also
meditating
upon
brahma
and
he
does
that
now
white
marble
of
him
are
sold
all
about
india
he
lives
in
a
good
house
in
a
noble
great
garden
in
benares
all
meet
and
proper
to
his
stupendous
rank
necessarily
he
does
not
go
abroad
in
the
streets
deities
would
never
be
able
to
move
about
handily
in
any
country
if
one
whom
we
recognized
and
adored
as
a
god
should
go
abroad
in
our
streets
and
the
day
it
was
to
happen
were
known
all
traffic
would
be
blocked
and
business
would
come
to
a
standstill
this
god
is
comfortably
housed
and
yet
modestly
all
things
considered
for
if
he
wanted
to
live
in
a
palace
he
would
only
need
to
speak
and
his
worshipers
would
gladly
build
it
sometimes
he
sees
devotees
for
a
moment
and
comforts
them
and
blesses
them
and
they
kiss
his
feet
and
go
away
happy
rank
is
nothing
to
him
he
being
a
god
to
him
all
men
are
alike
he
sees
whom
he
pleases
and
denies
himself
to
whom
he
pleases
sometimes
he
sees
a
prince
and
denies
himself
to
a
pauper
at
other
times
he
receives
the
pauper
and
turns
the
prince
away
however
he
does
not
receive
many
of
either
class
he
has
to
husband
his
time
for
his
meditations
i
think
he
would
receive
rev
parker
at
any
time
i
think
he
is
sorry
for
parker
and
i
think
parker
is
sorry
for
him
and
no
doubt
this
compassion
is
good
for
both
of
them
when
we
arrived
we
had
to
stand
around
in
the
garden
a
little
while
and
wait
and
the
outlook
was
not
good
for
he
had
been
turning
away
maharajas
that
day
and
receiving
only
the
and
we
belonged
in
between
somewhere
but
presently
a
servant
came
out
saying
it
was
all
right
he
was
coming
and
sure
enough
he
came
and
i
saw
him
that
object
of
the
worship
of
millions
it
was
a
strange
sensation
and
thrilling
i
wish
i
could
feel
it
stream
through
my
veins
again
and
yet
to
me
he
was
not
a
god
he
was
only
a
taj
the
thrill
was
not
my
thrill
but
had
come
to
me
secondhand
from
those
invisible
millions
of
believers
by
a
with
their
god
i
had
their
wire
and
got
their
monster
battery
whole
charge
he
was
tall
and
slender
indeed
emaciated
he
had
a
clean
cut
and
conspicuously
intellectual
face
and
a
deep
and
kindly
eye
he
looked
many
years
older
than
he
really
was
but
much
study
and
meditation
and
fasting
and
prayer
with
the
arid
life
he
had
led
as
hermit
and
beggar
could
account
for
that
he
is
wholly
nude
when
he
receives
natives
of
whatever
rank
they
may
be
but
he
had
white
cloth
around
his
loins
now
a
concession
to
parker
europe
prejudices
no
doubt
as
soon
as
i
had
sobered
down
a
little
we
got
along
very
well
together
and
i
found
him
a
most
pleasant
and
friendly
deity
he
had
heard
a
deal
about
chicago
and
showed
a
quite
remarkable
interest
in
it
for
a
god
it
all
came
of
the
world
fair
and
the
congress
of
religions
if
india
knows
about
nothing
else
american
she
knows
about
those
and
will
keep
them
in
mind
one
while
he
proposed
an
exchange
of
autographs
a
delicate
attention
which
made
me
believe
in
him
but
i
had
been
having
my
doubts
before
he
wrote
his
in
his
book
and
i
have
a
reverent
regard
for
that
book
though
the
words
run
from
right
to
left
and
so
i
ca
read
it
it
was
a
mistake
to
print
in
that
way
it
contains
his
voluminous
comments
on
the
hindoo
holy
writings
and
if
i
could
make
them
out
i
would
try
for
perfection
myself
i
gave
him
a
copy
of
huckleberry
finn
i
thought
it
might
rest
him
up
a
little
to
mix
it
in
along
with
his
meditations
on
brahma
for
he
looked
tired
and
i
knew
that
if
it
did
do
him
any
good
it
would
do
him
any
harm
he
has
a
scholar
meditating
under
him
mina
bahadur
rana
but
we
did
not
see
him
he
wears
clothes
and
is
very
imperfect
he
has
written
a
little
pamphlet
about
his
master
and
i
have
that
it
contains
a
of
the
master
and
himself
seated
on
a
rug
in
the
garden
the
portrait
of
the
master
is
very
good
indeed
the
posture
is
exactly
that
which
brahma
himself
affects
and
it
requires
long
arms
and
limber
legs
and
can
be
accumulated
only
by
gods
and
the
man
there
is
a
marble
relief
of
shri
in
the
garden
it
represents
him
in
this
same
posture
dear
me
it
is
a
strange
world
particularly
the
indian
division
of
it
this
pupil
mina
bahadur
rana
is
not
a
commonplace
person
but
a
man
of
distinguished
capacities
and
attainments
and
apparently
he
had
a
fine
worldly
career
in
front
of
him
he
was
serving
the
nepal
government
in
a
high
capacity
at
the
court
of
the
viceroy
of
india
twenty
years
ago
he
was
an
able
man
educated
a
thinker
a
man
of
property
but
the
longing
to
devote
himself
to
a
religious
life
came
upon
him
and
he
resigned
his
place
turned
his
back
upon
the
vanities
and
comforts
of
the
world
and
went
away
into
the
solitudes
to
live
in
a
hut
and
study
the
sacred
writings
and
meditate
upon
virtue
and
holiness
and
seek
to
attain
them
this
sort
of
religion
resembles
ours
christ
recommended
the
rich
to
give
away
all
their
property
and
follow
him
in
poverty
not
in
worldly
comfort
american
and
english
millionaires
do
it
every
day
and
thus
verify
and
confirm
to
the
world
the
tremendous
forces
that
lie
in
religion
yet
many
people
scoff
at
them
for
this
loyalty
to
duty
and
many
will
scoff
at
mina
bahadur
rana
and
call
him
a
crank
like
many
christians
of
great
character
and
intellect
he
has
made
the
study
of
his
scriptures
and
the
writing
of
books
of
commentaries
upon
them
the
loving
labor
of
his
life
like
them
he
has
believed
that
his
was
not
an
idle
and
foolish
waste
of
his
life
but
a
most
worthy
and
honorable
employment
of
it
yet
there
are
many
people
who
will
see
in
those
others
men
worthy
of
homage
and
deep
reverence
but
in
him
merely
a
crank
but
i
shall
not
he
has
my
reverence
and
i
do
offer
it
as
a
common
thing
and
poor
but
as
an
unusual
thing
and
of
value
the
ordinary
reverence
the
reverence
defined
and
explained
by
the
dictionary
costs
nothing
reverence
for
one
own
sacred
things
parents
religion
flag
laws
and
respect
for
one
own
beliefs
these
are
feelings
which
we
can
not
even
help
they
come
natural
to
us
they
are
involuntary
like
breathing
there
is
no
personal
merit
in
breathing
but
the
reverence
which
is
difficult
and
which
has
personal
merit
in
it
is
the
respect
which
you
pay
without
compulsion
to
the
political
or
religious
attitude
of
a
man
whose
beliefs
are
not
yours
you
ca
revere
his
gods
or
his
politics
and
no
one
expects
you
to
do
that
but
you
could
respect
his
belief
in
them
if
you
tried
hard
enough
and
you
could
respect
him
too
if
you
tried
hard
enough
but
it
is
very
very
difficult
it
is
next
to
impossible
and
so
we
hardly
ever
try
if
the
man
does
believe
as
we
do
we
say
he
is
a
crank
and
that
settles
it
i
mean
it
does
nowadays
because
now
we
ca
burn
him
we
are
always
canting
about
people
irreverence
always
charging
this
offense
upon
somebody
or
other
and
thereby
intimating
that
we
are
better
than
that
person
and
do
not
commit
that
offense
ourselves
whenever
we
do
this
we
are
in
a
lying
attitude
and
our
speech
is
cant
for
none
of
us
are
reverent
in
a
meritorious
way
deep
down
in
our
hearts
we
are
all
irreverent
there
is
probably
not
a
single
exception
to
this
rule
in
the
earth
there
is
probably
not
one
person
whose
reverence
rises
higher
than
respect
for
his
own
sacred
things
and
therefore
it
is
not
a
thing
to
boast
about
and
be
proud
of
since
the
most
degraded
savage
has
that
and
like
the
best
of
us
has
nothing
higher
to
speak
plainly
we
despise
all
reverences
and
all
objects
of
reverence
which
are
outside
the
pale
of
our
own
list
of
sacred
things
and
yet
with
strange
inconsistency
we
are
shocked
when
other
people
despise
and
defile
the
things
which
are
holy
to
us
suppose
we
should
meet
with
a
paragraph
like
the
following
in
the
newspapers
yesterday
a
visiting
party
of
the
british
nobility
had
a
picnic
at
mount
vernon
and
in
the
tomb
of
washington
they
ate
their
luncheon
sang
popular
songs
played
games
and
danced
waltzes
and
polkas
should
we
be
shocked
should
we
feel
outraged
should
we
be
amazed
should
we
call
the
performance
a
desecration
yes
that
would
all
happen
we
should
denounce
those
people
in
round
terms
and
call
them
hard
names
and
suppose
we
found
this
paragraph
in
the
newspapers
yesterday
a
visiting
party
of
american
had
a
picnic
in
westminster
abbey
and
in
that
sacred
place
they
ate
their
luncheon
sang
popular
songs
played
games
and
danced
waltzes
and
polkas
would
the
english
be
shocked
would
they
feel
outraged
would
they
be
amazed
would
they
call
the
performance
a
desecration
that
would
all
happen
the
would
be
denounced
in
round
terms
they
would
be
called
hard
names
in
the
tomb
at
mount
vernon
lie
the
ashes
of
america
most
honored
son
in
the
abbey
the
ashes
of
england
greatest
dead
the
tomb
of
tombs
the
costliest
in
the
earth
the
wonder
of
the
world
the
taj
was
built
by
a
great
emperor
to
honor
the
memory
of
a
perfect
wife
and
perfect
mother
one
in
whom
there
was
no
spot
or
blemish
whose
love
was
his
stay
and
support
whose
life
was
the
light
of
the
world
to
him
in
it
her
ashes
lie
and
to
the
mohammedan
millions
of
india
it
is
a
holy
place
to
them
it
is
what
mount
vernon
is
to
americans
it
is
what
the
abbey
is
to
the
english
major
sleeman
wrote
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
the
italics
are
mine
i
would
here
enter
my
humble
protest
against
the
quadrille
and
lunch
parties
which
are
sometimes
given
to
european
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
station
at
this
imperial
tomb
drinking
and
dancing
are
no
doubt
very
good
things
in
their
season
but
they
are
sadly
out
of
place
in
a
sepulchre
were
there
any
americans
among
those
lunch
parties
if
they
were
invited
there
were
if
my
imagined
in
westminster
and
the
tomb
of
washington
should
take
place
the
incident
would
cause
a
vast
outbreak
of
bitter
eloquence
about
barbarism
and
irreverence
and
it
would
come
from
two
sets
of
people
who
would
go
next
day
and
dance
in
the
taj
if
they
had
a
chance
as
we
took
our
leave
of
the
benares
god
and
started
away
we
noticed
a
group
of
natives
waiting
respectfully
just
within
the
gate
a
rajah
from
somewhere
in
india
and
some
people
of
lesser
consequence
the
god
beckoned
them
to
come
and
as
we
passed
out
the
rajah
was
kneeling
and
reverently
kissing
his
sacred
feet
if
barnum
but
barnum
ambitions
are
at
rest
this
god
will
remain
in
the
holy
peace
and
seclusion
of
his
garden
undisturbed
barnum
could
not
have
gotten
him
anyway
still
he
would
have
found
a
substitute
that
would
answer
chapter
liv
do
not
undervalue
the
headache
while
it
is
at
its
sharpest
it
seems
a
bad
investment
but
when
relief
begins
the
unexpired
remainder
is
worth
a
minute
wilson
new
calendar
a
comfortable
railway
journey
of
seventeen
and
a
half
hours
brought
us
to
the
capital
of
india
which
is
likewise
the
capital
of
bengal
calcutta
like
bombay
it
has
a
population
of
nearly
a
million
natives
and
a
small
gathering
of
white
people
it
is
a
huge
city
and
fine
and
is
called
the
city
of
palaces
it
is
rich
in
historical
memories
rich
in
british
achievement
military
political
commercial
rich
in
the
results
of
the
miracles
done
by
that
brace
of
mighty
magicians
clive
and
hastings
and
has
a
cloud
kissing
monument
to
one
ochterlony
it
is
a
fluted
candlestick
feet
high
this
lingam
is
the
only
large
monument
in
calcutta
i
believe
it
is
a
fine
ornament
and
will
keep
ochterlony
in
mind
wherever
you
are
in
calcutta
and
for
miles
around
you
can
see
it
and
always
when
you
see
it
you
think
of
ochterlony
and
so
there
is
not
an
hour
in
the
day
that
you
do
not
think
of
ochterlony
and
wonder
who
he
was
it
is
good
that
clive
can
not
come
back
for
he
would
think
it
was
for
plassey
and
then
that
great
spirit
would
be
wounded
when
the
revelation
came
that
it
was
not
clive
would
find
out
that
it
was
for
ochterlony
and
he
would
think
ochterlony
was
a
battle
and
he
would
think
it
was
a
great
one
too
and
he
would
say
with
three
thousand
i
whipped
sixty
thousand
and
founded
the
empire
and
there
is
no
monument
this
other
soldier
must
have
whipped
a
billion
with
a
dozen
and
saved
the
world
but
he
would
be
mistaken
ochterlony
was
a
man
not
a
battle
and
he
did
good
and
honorable
service
too
as
good
and
honorable
service
as
has
been
done
in
india
by
or
a
hundred
other
englishmen
of
courage
rectitude
and
distinguished
capacity
for
india
has
been
a
fertile
of
such
men
and
remains
so
great
men
both
in
war
and
in
the
civil
service
and
as
modest
as
great
but
they
have
no
monuments
and
were
not
expecting
any
ochterlony
could
not
have
been
expecting
one
and
it
is
not
at
all
likely
that
he
desired
one
certainly
not
until
clive
and
hastings
should
be
supplied
every
day
clive
and
hastings
lean
on
the
battlements
of
heaven
and
look
down
and
wonder
which
of
the
two
the
monument
is
for
and
they
fret
and
worry
because
they
can
not
find
out
and
so
the
peace
of
heaven
is
spoiled
for
them
and
lost
but
not
for
ochterlony
ochterlony
is
not
troubled
he
does
suspect
that
it
is
his
monument
heaven
is
sweet
and
peaceful
to
him
there
is
a
sort
of
unfairness
about
it
all
indeed
if
monuments
were
always
given
in
india
for
high
achievements
duty
straitly
performed
and
smirchless
records
the
landscape
would
be
monotonous
with
them
the
handful
of
english
in
india
govern
the
indian
myriads
with
apparent
ease
and
without
noticeable
friction
through
tact
training
and
distinguished
administrative
ability
reinforced
by
just
and
liberal
laws
and
by
keeping
their
word
to
the
native
whenever
they
give
it
england
is
far
from
india
and
knows
little
about
the
eminent
services
performed
by
her
servants
there
for
it
is
the
newspaper
correspondent
who
makes
fame
and
he
is
not
sent
to
india
but
to
the
continent
to
report
the
doings
of
the
princelets
and
the
dukelets
and
where
they
are
visiting
and
whom
they
are
marrying
often
a
british
official
spends
thirty
or
forty
years
in
india
climbing
from
grade
to
grade
by
services
which
would
make
him
celebrated
anywhere
else
and
finishes
as
a
governing
a
great
realm
and
millions
of
subjects
then
he
goes
home
to
england
substantially
unknown
and
unheard
of
and
settles
down
in
some
modest
corner
and
is
as
one
extinguished
ten
years
later
there
is
a
obituary
in
the
london
papers
and
the
reader
is
paralyzed
by
the
splendors
of
a
career
which
he
is
not
sure
that
he
had
ever
heard
of
before
but
meanwhile
he
has
learned
all
about
the
continental
princelets
and
dukelets
the
average
man
is
profoundly
ignorant
of
countries
that
lie
remote
from
his
own
when
they
are
mentioned
in
his
presence
one
or
two
facts
and
maybe
a
couple
of
names
rise
like
torches
in
his
mind
lighting
up
an
inch
or
two
of
it
and
leaving
the
rest
all
dark
the
mention
of
egypt
suggests
some
biblical
facts
and
the
more
the
mention
of
south
africa
suggests
kimberly
and
the
diamonds
and
there
an
end
formerly
the
mention
to
a
hindoo
of
america
suggested
a
name
george
washington
with
that
his
familiarity
with
our
country
was
exhausted
latterly
his
familiarity
with
it
has
doubled
in
bulk
so
that
when
america
is
mentioned
now
two
torches
flare
up
in
the
dark
caverns
of
his
mind
and
he
says
ah
the
country
of
the
great
man
washington
and
of
the
holy
city
chicago
for
he
knows
about
the
congress
of
religion
and
this
has
enabled
him
to
get
an
erroneous
impression
of
chicago
when
india
is
mentioned
to
the
citizen
of
a
far
country
it
suggests
clive
hastings
the
mutiny
kipling
and
a
number
of
other
great
events
and
the
mention
of
calcutta
infallibly
brings
up
the
black
hole
and
so
when
that
citizen
finds
himself
in
the
capital
of
india
he
goes
first
of
all
to
see
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
and
is
disappointed
the
black
hole
was
not
preserved
it
is
gone
long
long
ago
it
is
strange
just
as
it
stood
it
was
itself
a
monument
a
one
it
was
finished
it
was
complete
its
materials
were
strong
and
lasting
it
needed
no
furbishing
up
no
repairs
it
merely
needed
to
be
let
alone
it
was
the
first
brick
the
foundation
stone
upon
which
was
reared
a
mighty
empire
the
indian
empire
of
great
britain
it
was
the
ghastly
episode
of
the
black
hole
that
maddened
the
british
and
brought
clive
that
young
military
marvel
raging
up
from
madras
it
was
the
seed
from
which
sprung
plassey
and
it
was
that
extraordinary
battle
whose
like
had
not
been
seen
in
the
earth
since
agincourt
that
laid
deep
and
strong
the
foundations
of
england
colossal
indian
sovereignty
and
yet
within
the
time
of
men
who
still
live
the
black
hole
was
torn
down
and
thrown
away
as
carelessly
as
if
its
bricks
were
common
clay
not
ingots
of
historic
gold
there
is
no
accounting
for
human
beings
the
supposed
site
of
the
black
hole
is
marked
by
an
engraved
plate
i
saw
that
and
better
that
than
nothing
the
black
hole
was
a
prison
a
cell
is
nearer
the
right
word
eighteen
feet
square
the
dimensions
of
an
ordinary
bedchamber
and
into
this
place
the
victorious
nabob
of
bengal
packed
of
his
english
prisoners
there
was
hardly
standing
room
for
them
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
was
to
be
got
the
time
was
night
the
weather
sweltering
hot
before
the
dawn
came
the
captives
were
all
dead
but
holwell
long
account
of
the
awful
episode
was
familiar
to
the
world
a
hundred
years
ago
but
one
seldom
sees
in
print
even
an
extract
from
it
in
our
day
among
the
striking
things
in
it
is
this
holwell
perishing
with
thirst
kept
himself
alive
by
sucking
the
perspiration
from
his
sleeves
it
gives
one
a
vivid
idea
of
the
situation
he
presently
found
that
while
he
was
busy
drawing
life
from
one
of
his
sleeves
a
young
english
gentleman
was
stealing
supplies
from
the
other
one
holwell
was
an
unselfish
man
a
man
of
the
most
generous
impulses
he
lived
and
died
famous
for
these
fine
and
rare
qualities
yet
when
he
found
out
what
was
happening
to
that
unwatched
sleeve
he
took
the
precaution
to
suck
that
one
dry
first
the
miseries
of
the
black
hole
were
able
to
change
even
a
nature
like
his
but
that
young
gentleman
was
one
of
the
survivors
and
he
said
it
was
the
stolen
perspiration
that
saved
his
life
from
the
middle
of
holwell
narrative
i
will
make
a
brief
excerpt
then
a
general
prayer
to
heaven
to
hasten
the
approach
of
the
flames
to
the
right
and
left
of
us
and
put
a
period
to
our
misery
but
these
failing
they
whose
strength
and
spirits
were
quite
exhausted
laid
themselves
down
and
expired
quietly
upon
their
fellows
others
who
had
yet
some
strength
and
vigor
left
made
a
last
effort
at
the
windows
and
several
succeeded
by
leaping
and
scrambling
over
the
backs
and
heads
of
those
in
the
first
rank
and
got
hold
of
the
bars
from
which
there
was
no
removing
them
many
to
the
right
and
left
sunk
with
the
violent
pressure
and
were
soon
suffocated
for
now
a
steam
arose
from
the
living
and
the
dead
which
affected
us
in
all
its
circumstances
as
if
we
were
forcibly
held
with
our
heads
over
a
bowl
full
of
strong
volatile
spirit
of
hartshorn
until
suffocated
nor
could
the
effluvia
of
the
one
be
distinguished
from
the
other
and
frequently
when
i
was
forced
by
the
load
upon
my
head
and
shoulders
to
hold
my
face
down
i
was
obliged
near
as
i
was
to
the
window
instantly
to
raise
it
again
to
avoid
suffocation
i
need
not
my
dear
friend
ask
your
commiseration
when
i
tell
you
that
in
this
plight
from
half
an
hour
past
eleven
till
near
two
in
the
morning
i
sustained
the
weight
of
a
heavy
man
with
his
knees
in
my
back
and
the
pressure
of
his
whole
body
on
my
head
a
dutch
surgeon
who
had
taken
his
seat
upon
my
left
shoulder
and
a
topaz
a
black
christian
soldier
bearing
on
my
right
all
which
nothing
could
have
enabled
me
to
support
but
the
props
and
pressure
equally
sustaining
me
all
around
the
two
latter
i
frequently
dislodged
by
shifting
my
hold
on
the
bars
and
driving
my
knuckles
into
their
ribs
but
my
friend
above
stuck
fast
held
immovable
by
two
bars
i
exerted
anew
my
strength
and
fortitude
but
the
repeated
trials
and
efforts
i
made
to
dislodge
the
insufferable
incumbrances
upon
me
at
last
quite
exhausted
me
and
towards
two
finding
i
must
quit
the
window
or
sink
where
i
was
i
resolved
on
the
former
having
bore
truly
for
the
sake
of
others
infinitely
more
for
life
than
the
best
of
it
is
worth
in
the
rank
close
behind
me
was
an
officer
of
one
of
the
ships
whose
name
was
cary
and
who
had
behaved
with
much
bravery
during
the
siege
his
wife
a
fine
woman
though
country
born
would
not
quit
him
but
accompanied
him
into
the
prison
and
was
one
who
survived
this
poor
wretch
had
been
long
raving
for
water
and
air
i
told
him
i
was
determined
to
give
up
life
and
recommended
his
gaining
my
station
on
my
quitting
it
he
made
a
fruitless
attempt
to
get
my
place
but
the
dutch
surgeon
who
sat
on
my
shoulder
supplanted
him
poor
cary
expressed
his
thankfulness
and
said
he
would
give
up
life
too
but
it
was
with
the
utmost
labor
we
forced
our
way
from
the
window
several
in
the
inner
ranks
appearing
to
me
dead
standing
unable
to
fall
by
the
throng
and
equal
pressure
around
he
laid
himself
down
to
die
and
his
death
i
believe
was
very
sudden
for
he
was
a
short
full
sanguine
man
his
strength
was
great
and
i
imagine
had
he
not
retired
with
me
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
force
my
way
i
was
at
this
time
sensible
of
no
pain
and
little
uneasiness
i
can
give
you
no
better
idea
of
my
situation
than
by
repeating
my
simile
of
the
bowl
of
spirit
of
hartshorn
i
found
a
stupor
coming
on
apace
and
laid
myself
down
by
that
gallant
old
man
the
rev
jervas
bellamy
who
laid
dead
with
his
son
the
lieutenant
hand
in
hand
near
the
southernmost
wall
of
the
prison
when
i
had
lain
there
some
little
time
i
still
had
reflection
enough
to
suffer
some
uneasiness
in
the
thought
that
i
should
be
trampled
upon
when
dead
as
i
myself
had
done
to
others
with
some
difficulty
i
raised
myself
and
gained
the
platform
a
second
time
where
i
presently
lost
all
sensation
the
last
trace
of
sensibility
that
i
have
been
able
to
recollect
after
my
laying
down
was
my
sash
being
uneasy
about
my
waist
which
i
untied
and
threw
from
me
of
what
passed
in
this
interval
to
the
time
of
my
resurrection
from
this
hole
of
horrors
i
can
give
you
no
account
there
was
plenty
to
see
in
calcutta
but
there
was
not
plenty
of
time
for
it
i
saw
the
fort
that
clive
built
and
the
place
where
warren
hastings
and
the
author
of
the
junius
letters
fought
their
duel
and
the
great
botanical
gardens
and
the
fashionable
afternoon
turnout
in
the
maidan
and
a
grand
review
of
the
garrison
in
a
great
plain
at
sunrise
and
a
military
tournament
in
which
great
bodies
of
native
soldiery
exhibited
the
perfection
of
their
drill
at
all
arms
a
spectacular
and
beautiful
show
occupying
several
nights
and
closing
with
the
mimic
storming
of
a
native
fort
which
was
as
good
as
the
reality
for
thrilling
and
accurate
detail
and
better
than
the
reality
for
security
and
comfort
we
had
a
pleasure
excursion
on
the
by
courtesy
of
friends
and
devoted
the
rest
of
the
time
to
social
life
and
the
indian
museum
one
should
spend
a
month
in
the
museum
an
enchanted
palace
of
indian
antiquities
indeed
a
person
might
spend
half
a
year
among
the
beautiful
and
wonderful
things
without
exhausting
their
interest
it
was
winter
we
were
of
kipling
hosts
of
tourists
who
travel
up
and
down
india
in
the
cold
weather
showing
how
things
ought
to
be
managed
it
is
a
common
expression
there
the
cold
weather
and
the
people
think
there
is
such
a
thing
it
is
because
they
have
lived
there
half
a
lifetime
and
their
perceptions
have
become
blunted
when
a
person
is
accustomed
to
in
the
shade
his
ideas
about
cold
weather
are
not
valuable
i
had
read
in
the
histories
that
the
june
marches
made
between
lucknow
and
cawnpore
by
the
british
forces
in
the
time
of
the
mutiny
were
made
weather
in
the
shade
and
had
taken
it
for
historical
embroidery
i
had
read
it
again
in
account
of
his
military
experiences
in
the
mutiny
at
least
i
thought
i
had
and
in
calcutta
i
asked
him
if
it
was
true
and
he
said
it
was
an
officer
of
high
rank
who
had
been
in
the
thick
of
the
mutiny
said
the
same
as
long
as
those
men
were
talking
about
what
they
knew
they
were
trustworthy
and
i
believed
them
but
when
they
said
it
was
now
cold
weather
i
saw
that
they
had
traveled
outside
of
their
sphere
of
knowledge
and
were
floundering
i
believe
that
in
india
cold
weather
is
merely
a
conventional
phrase
and
has
come
into
use
through
the
necessity
of
having
some
way
to
distinguish
between
weather
which
will
melt
a
brass
and
weather
which
will
only
make
it
mushy
it
was
observable
that
brass
ones
were
in
use
while
i
was
in
calcutta
showing
that
it
was
not
yet
time
to
change
to
porcelain
i
was
told
the
change
to
porcelain
was
not
usually
made
until
may
but
this
cold
weather
was
too
warm
for
us
so
we
started
to
darjeeling
in
the
himalayas

hour

up

and
seems
to
stretch
away

away

away
dimming
and
softening
to
the
uttermost
bounds

nowhere

a

there

with
the
sunshine
glancing
from
the
varnished
surface
of
their
drooping
vast
leaves
and
there
are
frequent
groves
of
palm
and
an
effective
accent
is
given
to
the
landscape
by
isolated
individuals
of
this
picturesque
family
towering
their
plumes
broken
and
hanging
ragged
nature
imitation
of
an
umbrella
that
has
been
out
to
see
what
a
cyclone
is
like
and
is
trying
not
to
look
disappointed
and
everywhere
through
the
soft
morning
vistas
we
glimpse
the
villages
the
countless
villages
the
myriad
villages
thatched
built
of
clean
new
matting
snuggling
among
grouped
palms
and
sheaves
of
bamboo
villages
villages
no
end
of
villages
not
three
hundred
yards
apart
and
dozens
and
dozens
of
them
in
sight
all
the
time
a
mighty
city
hundreds
of
miles
long
hundreds
of
miles
broad
made
all
of
villages
the
biggest
city
in
the
earth
and
as
populous
as
a
european
kingdom
i
have
seen
no
such
city
as
this
before
and
there
is
a
continuously
repeated
and
replenished
multitude
of
naked
men
in
view
on
both
sides
and
ahead
we
fly
through
it
mile
after
mile
but
still
it
is
always
there
on
both
sides
and
ahead
naked
men
and
boys
plowing
in
the
fields
but
not
woman
in
these
two
hours
i
have
not
seen
a
woman
or
a
girl
working
in
the
fields
from
greenland
icy
mountains
from
india
coral
strand
where
afric
sunny
fountains
roll
down
their
golden
sand
from
many
an
ancient
river
from
many
a
palmy
plain
they
call
us
to
deliver
their
land
from
error
chain
those
are
beautiful
verses
and
they
have
remained
in
my
memory
all
my
life
but
if
the
closing
lines
are
true
let
us
hope
that
when
we
come
to
answer
the
call
and
deliver
the
land
from
its
errors
we
shall
secrete
from
it
some
of
our
ways
and
at
the
same
time
borrow
some
of
its
pagan
ways
to
enrich
our
high
system
with
we
have
a
right
to
do
this
if
we
lift
those
people
up
we
have
a
right
to
lift
ourselves
up
nine
or
ten
grades
or
so
at
their
expense
a
few
years
ago
i
spent
several
weeks
at
tolz
in
bavaria
it
is
a
roman
catholic
region
and
not
even
benares
is
more
deeply
or
pervasively
or
intelligently
devout
in
my
diary
of
those
days
i
find
this
we
took
a
long
drive
yesterday
around
about
the
lovely
country
roads
but
it
was
a
drive
whose
pleasure
was
damaged
in
a
couple
of
ways
by
the
dreadful
shrines
and
by
the
shameful
spectacle
of
gray
and
venerable
old
grandmothers
toiling
in
the
fields
the
shrines
were
frequent
along
the
roads
figures
of
the
saviour
nailed
to
the
cross
and
streaming
with
blood
from
the
wounds
of
the
nails
and
the
thorns
when
missionaries
go
from
here
do
they
find
fault
with
the
pagan
idols
i
saw
many
women
seventy
and
even
eighty
years
old
mowing
and
binding
in
the
fields
and
pitchforking
the
loads
into
the
wagons
i
was
in
austria
later
and
in
munich
in
munich
i
saw
gray
old
women
pushing
trucks
up
hill
and
down
long
distances
trucks
laden
with
barrels
of
beer
incredible
loads
in
my
austrian
diary
i
find
this
in
the
fields
i
often
see
a
woman
and
a
cow
harnessed
to
the
plow
and
a
man
driving
in
the
public
street
of
marienbad
i
saw
an
old
bent
woman
in
harness
with
a
dog
drawing
a
laden
sled
over
bare
dirt
roads
and
bare
pavements
and
at
his
ease
walked
the
driver
smoking
his
pipe
a
hale
fellow
not
thirty
years
old
five
or
six
years
ago
i
bought
an
open
boat
made
a
kind
of
a
canvas
over
the
stern
of
it
to
shelter
me
from
sun
and
rain
hired
a
courier
and
a
boatman
and
made
a
floating
voyage
down
the
rhone
from
lake
bourget
to
marseilles
in
my
diary
of
that
trip
i
find
this
entry
i
was
far
down
the
rhone
then
passing
etienne
on
a
distant
ridge
inland
a
tall
openwork
structure
commandingly
situated
with
a
statue
of
the
virgin
standing
on
it
a
devout
country
all
down
this
river
wherever
there
is
a
crag
there
is
a
statue
of
the
virgin
on
it
i
believe
i
have
seen
a
hundred
of
them
and
yet
in
many
respects
the
peasantry
seem
to
be
mere
pagans
and
destitute
of
any
considerable
degree
of
we
reached
a
not
very
promising
looking
village
about
and
i
concluded
to
tie
up
for
the
day
munching
fruit
and
fogging
the
hood
with
had
grown
monotonous
i
could
not
have
the
hood
furled
because
the
floods
of
rain
fell
unceasingly
the
tavern
was
on
the
river
bank
as
is
the
custom
it
was
dull
there
and
melancholy
nothing
to
do
but
look
out
of
the
window
into
the
drenching
rain
and
shiver
one
could
do
that
for
it
was
bleak
and
cold
and
windy
and
country
france
furnishes
no
fire
winter
overcoats
did
not
help
me
much
they
had
to
be
supplemented
with
rugs
the
raindrops
were
so
large
and
struck
the
river
with
such
force
that
they
knocked
up
the
water
like
with
the
exception
of
a
very
occasional
woodenshod
peasant
nobody
was
abroad
in
this
bitter
weather
i
mean
nobody
of
our
sex
but
all
weathers
are
alike
to
the
women
in
these
continental
countries
to
them
and
the
other
animals
life
is
serious
nothing
interrupts
their
slavery
three
of
them
were
washing
clothes
in
the
river
under
the
window
when
i
arrived
and
they
continued
at
it
as
long
as
there
was
light
to
work
by
one
was
apparently
thirty
another
the
mother
above
fifty
the
third
grandmother
so
old
and
worn
and
gray
she
could
have
passed
for
eighty
i
took
her
to
be
that
old
they
had
no
waterproofs
nor
rubbers
of
course
over
their
shoulders
they
wore
gunnysacks
simply
conductors
for
rivers
of
water
some
of
the
volume
reached
the
ground
the
rest
soaked
in
on
the
way
at
last
a
vigorous
fellow
of
arrived
dry
and
comfortable
smoking
his
pipe
under
his
big
umbrella
in
an
open
son
and
grandson
of
those
women
he
stood
up
in
the
cart
sheltering
himself
and
began
to
superintend
issuing
his
orders
in
a
masterly
tone
of
command
and
showing
temper
when
they
were
not
obeyed
swiftly
enough
without
complaint
or
murmur
the
drowned
women
patiently
carried
out
the
orders
lifting
the
immense
baskets
of
soggy
clothing
into
the
cart
and
stowing
them
to
the
man
satisfaction
there
were
six
of
the
great
baskets
and
a
man
of
mere
ordinary
strength
could
not
have
lifted
any
one
of
them
the
cart
being
full
now
the
frenchman
descended
still
sheltered
by
his
umbrella
entered
the
tavern
and
the
women
went
drooping
homeward
trudging
in
the
wake
of
the
cart
and
soon
were
blended
with
the
deluge
and
lost
to
sight
when
i
went
down
into
the
public
room
the
frenchman
had
his
bottle
of
wine
and
plate
of
food
on
a
bare
table
black
with
grease
and
was
chomping
like
a
horse
he
had
the
little
religious
paper
which
is
in
everybody
hands
on
the
rhone
borders
and
was
enlightening
himself
with
the
histories
of
french
saints
who
used
to
flee
to
the
desert
in
the
middle
ages
to
escape
the
contamination
of
woman
for
two
hundred
years
france
has
been
sending
missionaries
to
other
savage
lands
to
spare
to
the
needy
from
poverty
like
hers
is
fine
and
true
generosity
but
to
get
back
to
india
where
as
my
favorite
poem
says
every
prospect
pleases
and
only
man
is
vile
it
is
because
bavaria
and
austria
and
france
have
not
introduced
their
civilization
to
him
yet
but
bavaria
and
austria
and
france
are
on
their
way
they
are
coming
they
will
rescue
him
they
will
refine
the
vileness
out
of
him
some
time
during
the
forenoon
approaching
the
mountains
we
changed
from
the
regular
train
to
one
composed
of
little
cars
that
skimmed
along
within
a
foot
of
the
ground
and
seemed
to
be
going
fifty
miles
an
hour
when
they
were
really
making
about
twenty
each
car
had
seating
capacity
for
persons
and
when
the
curtains
were
up
one
was
substantially
out
of
doors
and
could
see
everywhere
and
get
all
the
breeze
and
be
luxuriously
comfortable
it
was
not
a
pleasure
excursion
in
name
only
but
in
fact
after
a
while
the
stopped
at
a
little
wooden
coop
of
a
station
just
within
the
curtain
of
the
sombre
jungle
a
place
with
a
deep
and
dense
forest
of
great
trees
and
scrub
and
vines
all
about
it
the
royal
bengal
tiger
is
in
great
force
there
and
is
very
bold
and
unconventional
from
this
lonely
little
station
a
message
once
went
to
the
railway
manager
in
calcutta
tiger
eating
on
front
porch
telegraph
instructions
it
was
there
that
i
had
my
first
tiger
hunt
i
killed
thirteen
we
were
presently
away
again
and
the
train
began
to
climb
the
mountains
in
one
place
seven
wild
elephants
crossed
the
track
but
two
of
them
got
away
before
i
could
overtake
them
the
railway
journey
up
the
mountain
is
forty
miles
and
it
takes
eight
hours
to
make
it
it
is
so
wild
and
interesting
and
exciting
and
enchanting
that
it
ought
to
take
a
week
as
for
the
vegetation
it
is
a
museum
the
jungle
seemed
to
contain
samples
of
every
rare
and
curious
tree
and
bush
that
we
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
it
is
from
that
museum
i
think
that
the
globe
must
have
been
supplied
with
the
trees
and
vines
and
shrubs
that
it
holds
precious
the
road
is
infinitely
and
charmingly
crooked
it
goes
winding
in
and
out
under
lofty
cliffs
that
are
smothered
in
vines
and
foliage
and
around
the
edges
of
bottomless
chasms
and
all
the
way
one
glides
by
files
of
picturesque
natives
some
carrying
burdens
up
others
going
down
from
their
work
in
the
and
once
there
was
a
gaudy
wedding
procession
all
bright
tinsel
and
color
and
a
bride
comely
and
girlish
who
peeped
out
from
the
curtains
of
her
palanquin
exposing
her
face
with
that
pure
delight
which
the
young
and
happy
take
in
sin
for
sin
own
sake
by
and
by
we
were
well
up
in
the
region
of
the
clouds
and
from
that
breezy
height
we
looked
down
and
afar
over
a
wonderful
picture
the
plains
of
india
stretching
to
the
horizon
soft
and
fair
level
as
a
floor
shimmering
with
heat
mottled
with
and
cloven
with
shining
rivers
immediately
below
us
and
receding
down
down
down
toward
the
valley
was
a
shaven
confusion
of
hilltops
with
ribbony
roads
and
paths
squirming
and
snaking
all
over
them
and
about
them
every
curve
and
twist
sharply
distinct
at
an
elevation
of
feet
we
entered
a
thick
cloud
and
it
shut
out
the
world
and
kept
it
shut
out
we
climbed
feet
higher
then
began
to
descend
and
presently
got
down
to
darjeeling
which
is
feet
above
the
level
of
the
plains
we
had
passed
many
a
mountain
village
on
the
way
up
and
seen
some
new
kinds
of
natives
among
them
many
samples
of
the
fighting
ghurkas
they
are
not
large
men
but
they
are
strong
and
resolute
there
are
no
better
soldiers
among
britain
native
troops
and
we
had
passed
shoals
of
their
women
climbing
the
forty
miles
of
steep
road
from
the
valley
to
their
mountain
homes
with
tall
baskets
on
their
backs
hitched
to
their
foreheads
by
a
band
and
containing
a
freightage
weighing
i
will
not
say
how
many
hundreds
of
pounds
for
the
sum
is
unbelievable
these
were
young
women
and
they
strode
smartly
along
under
these
astonishing
burdens
with
the
air
of
people
out
for
a
holiday
i
was
told
that
a
woman
will
carry
a
piano
on
her
back
all
the
way
up
the
mountain
and
that
more
than
once
a
woman
had
done
it
if
these
were
old
women
i
should
regard
the
ghurkas
as
no
more
civilized
than
the
europeans
at
the
railway
station
at
darjeeling
you
find
plenty
of
open
coffins
in
which
you
sit
and
are
then
borne
on
men
shoulders
up
the
steep
roads
into
the
town
up
there
we
found
a
fairly
comfortable
hotel
the
property
of
an
indiscriminate
and
incoherent
landlord
who
looks
after
nothing
but
leaves
everything
to
his
army
of
indian
servants
no
he
does
look
after
the
bill
to
be
just
to
him
and
the
tourist
can
not
do
better
than
follow
his
example
i
was
told
by
a
resident
that
the
summit
of
kinchinjunga
is
often
hidden
in
the
clouds
and
that
sometimes
a
tourist
has
waited
days
and
then
been
obliged
to
go
away
without
a
sight
of
it
and
yet
went
not
disappointed
for
when
he
got
his
hotel
bill
he
recognized
that
he
was
now
seeing
the
highest
thing
in
the
himalayas
but
this
is
probably
a
lie
after
lecturing
i
went
to
the
club
that
night
and
that
was
a
comfortable
place
it
is
loftily
situated
and
looks
out
over
a
vast
spread
of
scenery
from
it
you
can
see
where
the
boundaries
of
three
countries
come
together
some
thirty
miles
away
thibet
is
one
of
them
nepaul
another
and
i
think
herzegovina
was
the
other
apparently
in
every
town
and
city
in
india
the
gentlemen
of
the
british
civil
and
military
service
have
a
club
sometimes
it
is
a
palatial
one
always
it
is
pleasant
and
homelike
the
hotels
are
not
always
as
good
as
they
might
be
and
the
stranger
who
has
access
to
the
club
is
grateful
for
his
privilege
and
knows
how
to
value
it
next
day
was
sunday
friends
came
in
the
gray
dawn
with
horses
and
my
party
rode
away
to
a
distant
point
where
kinchinjunga
and
mount
everest
show
up
best
but
i
stayed
at
home
for
a
private
view
for
it
was
very
old
and
i
was
not
acquainted
with
the
horses
any
way
i
got
a
pipe
and
a
few
blankets
and
sat
for
two
hours
at
the
window
and
saw
the
sun
drive
away
the
veiling
gray
and
touch
up
the
one
after
another
with
pale
pink
splashes
and
delicate
washes
of
gold
and
finally
flood
the
whole
mighty
convulsion
of
with
a
deluge
of
rich
splendors
kinchinjunga
peak
was
but
fitfully
visible
but
in
the
between
times
it
was
vividly
clear
against
the
sky
away
up
there
in
the
blue
dome
more
than
feet
above
sea
level
the
loftiest
land
i
had
ever
seen
by
feet
or
more
it
was
miles
away
mount
everest
is
a
thousand
feet
higher
but
it
was
not
a
part
of
that
sea
of
mountains
piled
up
there
before
me
so
i
did
not
see
it
but
i
did
not
care
because
i
think
that
mountains
that
are
as
high
as
that
are
disagreeable
i
changed
from
the
back
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
there
watching
the
swarthy
strange
tribes
flock
by
from
their
far
homes
in
the
himalayas
all
ages
and
both
sexes
were
represented
and
the
breeds
were
quite
new
to
me
though
the
costumes
of
the
thibetans
made
them
look
a
good
deal
like
chinamen
the
was
a
frequent
feature
it
brought
me
near
to
these
people
and
made
them
seem
kinfolk
of
mine
through
our
preacher
we
do
much
of
our
praying
by
proxy
we
do
not
whirl
him
around
a
stick
as
they
do
but
that
is
merely
a
detail
the
swarm
swung
briskly
by
hour
after
hour
a
strange
and
striking
pageant
it
was
wasted
there
and
it
seemed
a
pity
it
should
have
been
sent
streaming
through
the
cities
of
europe
or
america
to
refresh
eyes
weary
of
the
pale
monotonies
of
the
these
people
were
bound
for
the
bazar
with
things
to
sell
we
went
down
there
later
and
saw
that
novel
congress
of
the
wild
peoples
and
plowed
here
and
there
through
it
and
concluded
that
it
would
be
worth
coming
from
calcutta
to
see
even
if
there
were
no
kinchinjunga
and
everest
chapter
lvi
there
are
two
times
in
a
man
life
when
he
should
not
speculate
when
he
ca
afford
it
and
when
he
can
wilson
new
calendar
on
monday
and
tuesday
at
sunrise
we
again
had
views
of
the
stupendous
mountains
then
being
well
cooled
off
and
refreshed
we
were
ready
to
chance
the
weather
of
the
lower
world
once
more
we
traveled
up
hill
by
the
regular
train
five
miles
to
the
summit
then
changed
to
a
little
for
the
descent
it
was
the
size
of
a
sleigh
it
had
six
seats
and
was
so
low
that
it
seemed
to
rest
on
the
ground
it
had
no
engine
or
other
propelling
power
and
needed
none
to
help
it
fly
down
those
steep
inclines
it
only
needed
a
strong
brake
to
modify
its
flight
and
it
had
that
there
was
a
story
of
a
disastrous
trip
made
down
the
mountain
once
in
this
little
car
by
the
of
bengal
when
the
car
jumped
the
track
and
threw
its
passengers
over
a
precipice
it
was
not
true
but
the
story
had
value
for
me
for
it
made
me
nervous
and
nervousness
wakes
a
person
up
and
makes
him
alive
and
alert
and
heightens
the
thrill
of
a
new
and
doubtful
experience
the
car
could
really
jump
the
track
of
course
a
pebble
on
the
track
placed
there
by
either
accident
or
malice
at
a
sharp
curve
where
one
might
strike
it
before
the
eye
could
discover
it
could
derail
the
car
and
fling
it
down
into
india
and
the
fact
that
the
had
escaped
was
no
proof
that
i
would
have
the
same
luck
and
standing
there
looking
down
upon
the
indian
empire
from
the
airy
altitude
of
feet
it
seemed
unpleasantly
far
dangerously
far
to
be
flung
from
a
handcar
but
after
all
there
was
but
small
me
what
there
was
was
for
pugh
inspector
of
a
division
of
the
indian
police
in
whose
company
and
protection
we
had
come
from
calcutta
he
had
seen
long
service
as
an
artillery
officer
was
less
nervous
than
i
was
and
so
he
was
to
go
ahead
of
us
in
a
pilot
with
a
ghurka
and
another
native
and
the
plan
was
that
when
we
should
see
his
car
jump
over
a
precipice
we
must
put
on
our
break
sp
and
send
for
another
pilot
it
was
a
good
arrangement
also
barnard
chief
engineer
of
the
of
the
road
was
to
take
personal
charge
of
our
car
and
he
had
been
down
the
mountain
in
it
many
a
time
everything
looked
safe
indeed
there
was
but
one
questionable
detail
left
the
regular
train
was
to
follow
us
as
soon
as
we
should
start
and
it
might
run
over
us
privately
i
thought
it
would
the
road
fell
sharply
down
in
front
of
us
and
went
corkscrewing
in
and
out
around
the
crags
and
precipices
down
down
forever
down
suggesting
nothing
so
exactly
or
so
uncomfortably
as
a
croaked
toboggan
slide
with
no
end
to
it
pugh
waved
his
flag
and
started
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
and
before
i
could
get
out
of
the
car
we
were
gone
too
i
had
previously
had
but
one
sensation
like
the
shock
of
that
departure
and
that
was
the
gaspy
shock
that
took
my
breath
away
the
first
time
that
i
was
discharged
from
the
summit
of
a
toboggan
slide
but
in
both
instances
the
sensation
was
pleasurable
intensely
so
it
was
a
sudden
and
immense
exaltation
a
mixed
ecstasy
of
deadly
fright
and
unimaginable
joy
i
believe
that
this
combination
makes
the
perfection
of
human
delight
the
pilot
car
flight
down
the
mountain
suggested
the
swoop
of
a
swallow
that
is
skimming
the
ground
so
swiftly
and
smoothly
and
gracefully
it
swept
down
the
long
straight
reaches
and
soared
in
and
out
of
the
bends
and
around
the
corners
we
raced
after
it
and
seemed
to
flash
by
the
capes
and
crags
with
the
speed
of
light
and
now
and
then
we
almost
overtook
it
and
had
hopes
but
it
was
only
playing
with
us
when
we
got
near
it
released
its
brake
make
a
spring
around
a
corner
and
the
next
time
it
spun
into
view
a
few
seconds
later
it
looked
as
small
as
a
wheelbarrow
it
was
so
far
away
we
played
with
the
train
in
the
same
way
we
often
got
out
to
gather
flowers
or
sit
on
a
precipice
and
look
at
the
scenery
then
presently
we
would
hear
a
dull
and
growing
roar
and
the
long
coils
of
the
train
would
come
into
sight
behind
and
above
us
but
we
did
not
need
to
start
till
the
locomotive
was
close
down
upon
us
then
we
soon
left
it
far
behind
it
had
to
stop
at
every
station
therefore
it
was
not
an
embarrassment
to
us
our
brake
was
a
good
piece
of
machinery
it
could
bring
the
car
to
a
standstill
on
a
slope
as
steep
as
a
the
scenery
was
grand
and
varied
and
beautiful
and
there
was
no
hurry
we
could
always
stop
and
examine
it
there
was
abundance
of
time
we
did
not
need
to
hamper
the
train
if
it
wanted
the
road
we
could
switch
off
and
let
it
go
by
then
overtake
it
and
pass
it
later
we
stopped
at
one
place
to
see
the
gladstone
cliff
a
great
crag
which
the
ages
and
the
weather
have
sculptured
into
a
recognizable
portrait
of
the
venerable
statesman
gladstone
is
a
stockholder
in
the
road
and
nature
began
this
portrait
ten
thousand
years
ago
with
the
idea
of
having
the
compliment
ready
in
time
for
the
event
we
saw
a
banyan
tree
which
sent
down
supporting
stems
from
branches
which
were
sixty
feet
above
the
ground
that
is
i
suppose
it
was
a
banyan
its
bark
resembled
that
of
the
great
banyan
in
the
botanical
gardens
at
calcutta
that
thing
with
its
wilderness
of
vegetable
columns
and
there
were
frequent
glimpses
of
a
totally
leafless
tree
upon
whose
innumerable
twigs
and
branches
a
cloud
of
crimson
butterflies
had
lighted
apparently
in
fact
these
brilliant
red
butterflies
were
flowers
but
the
illusion
was
good
afterward
in
south
africa
i
saw
another
splendid
effect
made
by
red
flowers
this
flower
was
probably
called
the
should
have
been
so
named
anyway
it
had
a
slender
stem
several
feet
high
and
from
its
top
stood
up
a
single
tongue
of
flame
an
intensely
red
flower
of
the
size
and
shape
of
a
small
the
stems
stood
three
or
four
feet
apart
all
over
a
great
that
was
a
mile
long
and
make
one
think
of
what
the
place
de
la
concorde
would
be
if
its
myriad
lights
were
red
instead
of
white
and
yellow
a
few
miles
down
the
mountain
we
stopped
half
an
hour
to
see
a
thibetan
dramatic
performance
it
was
in
the
open
air
on
the
hillside
the
audience
was
composed
of
thibetans
ghurkas
and
other
unusual
people
the
costumes
of
the
actors
were
in
the
last
degree
outlandish
and
the
performance
was
in
keeping
with
the
clothes
to
an
accompaniment
of
barbarous
noises
the
actors
stepped
out
one
after
another
and
began
to
spin
around
with
immense
swiftness
and
vigor
and
violence
chanting
the
while
and
soon
the
whole
troupe
would
be
spinning
and
chanting
and
raising
the
dust
they
were
performing
an
ancient
and
celebrated
historical
play
and
a
chinaman
explained
it
to
me
in
pidjin
english
as
it
went
along
the
play
was
obscure
enough
without
the
explanation
with
the
explanation
added
it
was
opake
as
a
drama
this
ancient
historical
work
of
art
was
defective
i
thought
but
as
a
wild
and
barbarous
spectacle
the
representation
was
beyond
criticism
far
down
the
mountain
we
got
out
to
look
at
a
piece
of
remarkable
a
spiral
where
the
road
curves
upon
itself
with
such
abruptness
that
when
the
regular
train
came
down
and
entered
the
loop
we
stood
over
it
and
saw
the
locomotive
disappear
under
our
bridge
then
in
a
few
moments
appear
again
chasing
its
own
tail
and
we
saw
it
gain
on
it
overtake
it
draw
ahead
past
the
rear
cars
and
run
a
race
with
that
end
of
the
train
it
was
like
a
snake
swallowing
itself
down
the
mountain
we
stopped
about
an
hour
at
house
for
refreshments
and
while
we
were
sitting
on
the
veranda
looking
at
the
distant
panorama
of
hills
through
a
gap
in
the
forest
we
came
very
near
seeing
a
leopard
kill
a
it
killed
it
the
day
before
it
is
a
wild
place
and
lovely
from
the
woods
all
about
came
the
songs
of
birds
among
them
the
contributions
of
a
couple
of
birds
which
i
was
not
then
acquainted
with
the
bird
and
the
coppersmith
the
song
of
the
demon
starts
on
a
low
but
steadily
rising
key
and
is
a
spiral
twist
which
augments
in
intensity
and
severity
with
each
added
spiral
growing
sharper
and
sharper
and
more
and
more
painful
more
and
more
agonizing
more
and
more
maddening
intolerable
unendurable
as
it
bores
deeper
and
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
brain
until
at
last
the
brain
fever
comes
as
a
relief
and
the
man
dies
i
am
bringing
some
of
these
birds
home
to
america
they
will
be
a
great
curiosity
there
and
it
is
believed
that
in
our
climate
they
will
multiply
like
rabbits
the
coppersmith
bird
note
at
a
certain
distance
away
has
the
ring
of
a
sledge
on
granite
at
a
certain
other
distance
the
hammering
has
a
more
metallic
ring
and
you
might
think
that
the
bird
was
mending
a
copper
kettle
at
another
distance
it
has
a
more
woodeny
thump
but
it
is
a
thump
that
is
full
of
energy
and
sounds
just
like
starting
a
bung
so
he
is
a
hard
bird
to
name
with
a
single
name
he
is
a
coppersmith
and
and
even
then
he
is
not
completely
named
for
when
he
is
close
by
you
find
that
there
is
a
soft
deep
melodious
quality
in
his
thump
and
for
that
no
satisfying
name
occurs
to
you
you
will
not
mind
his
other
notes
but
when
he
camps
near
enough
for
you
to
hear
that
one
you
presently
find
that
his
measured
and
monotonous
repetition
of
it
is
beginning
to
disturb
you
next
it
will
weary
you
soon
it
will
distress
you
and
before
long
each
thump
will
hurt
your
head
if
this
goes
on
you
will
lose
your
mind
with
the
pain
and
misery
of
it
and
go
crazy
i
am
bringing
some
of
these
birds
home
to
america
there
is
nothing
like
them
there
they
will
be
a
great
surprise
and
it
is
said
that
in
a
climate
like
ours
they
will
surpass
expectation
for
fecundity
i
am
bringing
some
nightingales
too
and
some
i
got
them
in
italy
the
song
of
the
nightingale
is
the
deadliest
known
to
ornithology
that
demoniacal
shriek
can
kill
at
thirty
yards
the
note
of
the
is
infinitely
soft
and
sweet
soft
and
sweet
as
the
whisper
of
a
flute
but
penetrating
oh
beyond
belief
it
can
bore
through
it
is
a
lingering
note
and
comes
in
triplets
on
the
one
unchanging
key
then
a
silence
of
fifteen
seconds
then
the
triplet
again
and
so
on
all
night
at
first
it
is
divine
then
less
so
then
trying
then
distressing
then
excruciating
then
agonizing
and
at
the
end
of
two
hours
the
listener
is
a
maniac
and
so
presently
we
took
to
the
and
went
flying
down
the
mountain
again
flying
and
stopping
flying
and
stopping
till
at
last
we
were
in
the
plain
once
more
and
stowed
for
calcutta
in
the
regular
train
that
was
the
most
enjoyable
day
i
have
spent
in
the
earth
for
rousing
tingling
rapturous
pleasure
there
is
no
holiday
trip
that
approaches
the
down
the
himalayas
in
a
it
has
no
fault
no
blemish
no
lack
except
that
there
are
only
miles
of
it

of
five
hundred

so
far
as
i
am
able
to
judge
nothing
has
been
left
undone
either
by
man
or
nature
to
make
india
the
most
extraordinary
country
that
the
sun
visits
on
his
round
nothing
seems
to
have
been
forgotten
nothing
over
looked
always
when
you
think
you
have
come
to
the
end
of
her
tremendous
specialties
and
have
finished
banging
tags
upon
her
as
the
land
of
the
thug
the
land
of
the
plague
the
land
of
famine
the
land
of
giant
illusions
the
land
of
stupendous
mountains
and
so
forth
another
specialty
crops
up
and
another
tag
is
required
i
have
been
overlooking
the
fact
that
india
is
by
an
unapproachable
supremacy
the
land
of
murderous
wild
creatures
perhaps
it
will
be
simplest
to
throw
away
the
tags
and
generalize
her
with
one
name
as
the
land
of
wonders
for
many
years
the
british
indian
government
has
been
trying
to
destroy
the
murderous
wild
creatures
and
has
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
in
the
effort
the
annual
official
returns
show
that
the
undertaking
is
a
difficult
one
these
returns
exhibit
a
curious
annual
uniformity
in
results
the
sort
of
uniformity
which
you
find
in
the
annual
output
of
suicides
in
the
capitals
and
the
proportions
of
deaths
by
this
that
and
the
other
disease
you
can
always
come
close
to
foretelling
how
many
suicides
will
occur
in
paris
london
and
new
york
next
year
and
also
how
many
deaths
will
result
from
cancer
consumption
falling
out
of
the
window
getting
run
over
by
cabs
if
you
know
the
statistics
of
those
matters
for
the
present
year
in
the
same
way
with
one
indian
statistics
before
you
you
can
guess
closely
at
how
many
people
were
killed
in
that
empire
by
tigers
during
the
previous
year
and
the
year
before
that
and
the
year
before
that
and
at
how
many
were
killed
in
each
of
those
years
by
bears
how
many
by
wolves
and
how
many
by
snakes
and
you
can
also
guess
closely
at
how
many
people
are
going
to
be
killed
each
year
for
the
coming
five
years
by
each
of
those
agencies
you
can
also
guess
closely
at
how
many
of
each
agency
the
government
is
going
to
kill
each
year
for
the
next
five
years
i
have
before
me
statistics
covering
a
period
of
six
consecutive
years
by
these
i
know
that
in
india
the
tiger
kills
something
over
persons
every
year
and
that
the
government
responds
by
killing
about
double
as
many
tigers
every
year
in
four
of
the
six
years
referred
to
the
tiger
got
odd
in
one
of
the
remaining
two
years
he
got
only
but
in
the
other
remaining
year
he
made
his
average
good
by
scoring
he
is
always
sure
of
his
average
anyone
who
bets
that
the
tiger
will
kill
people
in
india
in
any
three
consecutive
years
has
invested
his
money
in
a
certainty
anyone
who
bets
that
he
will
kill
in
any
three
consecutive
years
is
absolutely
sure
to
lose
as
strikingly
uniform
as
are
the
statistics
of
suicide
they
are
not
any
more
so
than
are
those
of
the
tiger
annual
output
of
slaughtered
human
beings
in
india
the
government
work
is
quite
uniform
too
it
about
doubles
the
tiger
average
in
six
years
the
tiger
killed
persons
minus
in
the
same
six
years
tigers
were
killed
minus
the
wolf
kills
nearly
as
many
people
as
the
tiger
a
year
to
the
tiger
odd
but
while
he
is
doing
it
more
than
of
his
tribe
fall
the
leopard
kills
an
average
of
people
per
year
but
loses
of
his
own
mess
while
he
is
doing
it
the
bear
kills
people
per
year
at
a
cost
of
of
his
own
tribe
the
tiger
as
the
figures
show
makes
a
very
handsome
fight
against
man
but
it
is
nothing
to
the
elephant
fight
the
king
of
beasts
the
lord
of
the
jungle
loses
four
of
his
mess
per
year
but
he
kills
forty
five
persons
to
make
up
for
it
but
when
it
comes
to
killing
cattle
the
lord
of
the
jungle
is
not
interested
he
kills
but
in
six
years
horses
of
hunters
no
doubt
but
in
the
same
six
the
tiger
kills
more
than
the
leopard
the
bear
the
wolf
the
hyena
more
than
other
wild
beasts
and
the
snakes
a
grand
total
of
more
than
an
average
of
head
per
year
in
response
the
government
kills
in
the
six
years
a
total
of
wild
beasts
and
snakes
ten
for
one
it
will
be
perceived
that
the
snakes
are
not
much
interested
in
cattle
they
kill
only
odd
per
year
the
snakes
are
much
more
interested
in
man
india
swarms
with
deadly
snakes
at
the
head
of
the
list
is
the
cobra
the
deadliest
known
to
the
world
a
snake
whose
bite
kills
where
the
rattlesnake
bite
merely
entertains
in
india
the
annual
by
snakes
are
as
uniform
as
regular
and
as
forecastable
as
are
the
and
the
anyone
who
bets
that
in
india
in
any
three
consecutive
years
the
snakes
will
kill
persons
will
win
his
bet
and
anyone
who
bets
that
in
india
in
any
three
consecutive
years
the
snakes
will
kill
persons
will
lose
his
bet
in
india
the
snakes
kill
people
a
year
they
hardly
ever
fall
short
of
it
they
as
seldom
exceed
it
an
insurance
actuary
could
take
the
indian
census
tables
and
the
government
snake
tables
and
tell
you
within
sixpence
how
much
it
would
be
worth
to
insure
a
man
against
death
by
there
if
i
had
a
dollar
for
every
person
killed
per
year
in
india
i
would
rather
have
it
than
any
other
property
as
it
is
the
only
property
in
the
world
not
subject
to
shrinkage
i
should
like
to
have
a
royalty
on
the
of
the
snake
business
too
and
am
in
london
now
trying
to
get
it
but
when
i
get
it
it
is
not
going
to
be
as
regular
an
income
as
the
other
will
be
if
i
get
that
i
have
applied
for
it
the
snakes
transact
their
end
of
the
business
in
a
more
orderly
and
systematic
way
than
the
government
transacts
its
end
of
it
because
the
snakes
have
had
a
long
experience
and
know
all
about
the
traffic
you
can
make
sure
that
the
government
will
never
kill
fewer
than
snakes
in
a
year
and
that
it
will
newer
quite
reach
too
much
room
for
oscillation
good
speculative
stock
to
bear
or
bull
and
buy
and
sell
long
and
short
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
but
not
eligible
for
investment
like
the
other
the
man
that
speculates
in
the
government
snake
crop
wants
to
go
carefully
i
would
not
advise
a
man
to
buy
a
single
crop
at
all
i
mean
a
crop
of
futures
for
the
possible
wobble
is
something
quite
extraordinary
if
he
can
buy
six
future
crops
in
a
bunch
seller
to
deliver
altogether
that
is
another
matter
i
do
not
know
what
snakes
are
worth
now
but
i
know
what
they
would
be
worth
then
for
the
statistics
show
that
the
seller
could
not
come
within
of
carrying
out
his
contract
however
i
think
that
a
person
who
speculates
in
snakes
is
a
fool
anyway
he
always
regrets
it
afterwards
to
finish
the
statistics
in
six
years
the
wild
beasts
kill
persons
and
the
snakes
kill
in
the
same
six
the
government
kills
snakes
plenty
left
there
are
narrow
escapes
in
india
in
the
very
jungle
where
i
killed
sixteen
tigers
and
all
those
elephants
a
cobra
bit
me
but
it
got
well
everyone
was
surprised
this
could
not
happen
twice
in
ten
years
perhaps
usually
death
would
result
in
fifteen
minutes
we
struck
out
westward
or
northwestward
from
calcutta
on
an
itinerary
of
a
sort
which
would
in
the
course
of
time
carry
us
across
india
to
its
northwestern
corner
and
the
border
of
afghanistan
the
first
part
of
the
trip
carried
us
through
a
great
region
which
was
an
endless
garden
miles
and
miles
of
the
beautiful
flower
from
whose
juices
comes
the
opium
and
at
muzaffurpore
we
were
in
the
midst
of
the
indigo
culture
thence
by
a
branch
road
to
the
ganges
at
a
point
near
dinapore
and
by
a
train
which
would
have
missed
the
connection
by
a
week
but
for
the
thoughtfulness
of
some
british
officers
who
were
along
and
who
knew
the
ways
of
trains
that
are
run
by
natives
without
white
supervision
this
train
stopped
at
every
village
for
no
purpose
connected
with
business
apparently
we
put
out
nothing
we
took
nothing
aboard
the
train
bands
stepped
ashore
and
gossiped
with
friends
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
pulled
out
and
repeated
this
at
the
succeeding
villages
we
had
miles
to
go
and
six
hours
to
do
it
in
but
it
was
plain
that
we
were
not
going
to
make
it
it
was
then
that
the
english
officers
said
it
was
now
necessary
to
turn
this
gravel
train
into
an
express
so
they
gave
the
a
rupee
and
told
him
to
fly
it
was
a
simple
remedy
after
that
we
made
ninety
miles
an
hour
we
crossed
the
ganges
just
at
dawn
made
our
connection
and
went
to
benares
where
we
stayed
hours
and
inspected
that
strange
and
fascinating
again
then
left
for
lucknow
a
city
which
is
perhaps
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
many
monuments
of
british
fortitude
and
valor
that
are
scattered
about
the
earth
the
heat
was
pitiless
the
flat
plains
were
destitute
of
grass
and
baked
dry
by
the
sun
they
were
the
color
of
pale
dust
which
was
flying
in
clouds
but
it
was
much
hotter
than
this
when
the
relieving
forces
marched
to
lucknow
in
the
time
of
the
mutiny
those
were
the
days

wilson
new
calendar
it
seems
to
be
settled
now
that
among
the
many
causes
from
which
the
great
mutiny
sprang
the
main
one
was
the
annexation
of
the
kingdom
of
oudh
by
the
east
india
company
characterized
by
sir
henry
lawrence
as
the
most
unrighteous
act
that
was
ever
committed
in
the
spring
of
a
mutinous
spirit
was
observable
in
many
of
the
native
garrisons
and
it
grew
day
by
day
and
spread
wider
and
wider
the
younger
military
men
saw
something
very
serious
in
it
and
would
have
liked
to
take
hold
of
it
vigorously
and
stamp
it
out
promptly
but
they
were
not
in
authority
were
in
the
high
places
of
the
army
men
who
should
have
been
retired
long
before
because
of
their
great
age
and
they
regarded
the
matter
as
a
thing
of
no
consequence
they
loved
their
native
soldiers
and
would
not
believe
that
anything
could
move
them
to
revolt
everywhere
these
obstinate
veterans
listened
serenely
to
the
rumbling
of
the
volcanoes
under
them
and
said
it
was
nothing
and
so
the
propagators
of
mutiny
had
everything
their
own
way
they
moved
from
camp
to
camp
undisturbed
and
painted
to
the
native
soldier
the
wrongs
his
people
were
suffering
at
the
hands
of
the
english
and
made
his
heart
burn
for
revenge
they
were
able
to
point
to
two
facts
of
formidable
value
as
backers
of
their
persuasions
in
clive
day
native
armies
were
incoherent
mobs
and
without
effective
arms
therefore
they
were
weak
against
clive
organized
handful
of
men
but
the
thing
was
the
other
way
now
the
british
forces
were
native
they
had
been
trained
by
the
british
organized
by
the
british
armed
by
the
british
all
the
power
was
in
their
hands
they
were
a
club
made
by
british
hands
to
beat
out
british
brains
with
there
was
nothing
to
oppose
their
mass
nothing
but
a
few
weak
battalions
of
british
soldiers
scattered
about
india
a
force
not
worth
speaking
of
this
argument
taken
alone
might
not
have
succeeded
for
the
bravest
and
best
indian
troops
had
a
wholesome
dread
of
the
white
soldier
whether
he
was
weak
or
strong
but
the
agitators
backed
it
with
their
second
and
best
point
prophecy
a
prophecy

hundred
years
old
the
indian
is
open
to
prophecy
at
all
times
argument
may
fail
to
convince

but
not
prophecy
there
was
a
prophecy
that
a
hundred
years
from
the
year
of
that
battle
of
clive
which
founded
the
british
indian
empire
the
british
power
would
be
overthrown
and
swept
away
by
the
natives
the
mutiny
broke
out
at
meerut
on
the
of
may
and
fired
a
train
of
tremendous
historical
explosions
nana
sahib
massacre
of
the

garrison
of

occurred
in
june
and
the
long
siege
of
lucknow
began
the
military
history
of
england
is
old
and
great
but
i
think
it
must
be
granted
that
the
crushing
of
the
mutiny
is
the
greatest
chapter
in
it
the
british
were
caught
asleep
and
unprepared
they
were
a
few
thousands
swallowed
up
in
an
ocean
of
hostile
populations
it
would
take
months
to
inform
england
and
get
help
but
they
did
not
falter
or
stop
to
count
the
odds
but
with
english
resolution
and
english
devotion
they
took
up
their
task
and
went
stubbornly
on
with
it
through
good
fortune
and
bad
and
fought
the
most
unpromising
fight
that
one
may
read
of
in
fiction
or
out
of
it
and
won
it
thoroughly
the
mutiny
broke
out
so
suddenly
and
spread
with
such
rapidity
that
there
was
but
little
time
for
occupants
of
weak
outlying
stations
to
escape
to
places
of
safety
attempts
were
made
of
course
but
they
were
attended
by
hardships
as
bitter
as
death
in
the
few
cases
which
were
successful
for
the
heat
ranged
between
and
in
the
shade
the
way
led
through
hostile
peoples
and
food
and
water
were
hardly
to
be
had
for
ladies
and
children
accustomed
to
ease
and
comfort
and
plenty
such
a
journey
must
have
been
a
cruel
experience

shots
fired

looking
out
i
saw
my
husband
driving
furiously
from
the
waving
his
whip
i
ran
to
him
and
seeing
a
bearer
with
my
child
in
his
arms
i
caught
her
up
and
got
into
the
buggy
at
the
we
found
all
the
officers
assembled
together
with
sixty
sepoys
who
had
remained
faithful
we
went
off
in
one
large
party
amidst
a
general
conflagration
of
our
late
homes
we
reached
the
caravanserai
at
chattapore
the
next
morning
and
thence
started
for
callinger
at
this
point
our
sepoy
escort
deserted
us
we
were
fired
upon
by
and
one
officer
was
shot
dead
we
heard
likewise
that
the
people
had
risen
at
callinger
so
we
returned
and
walked
back
ten
miles
that
day
m
and
i
carried
the
child
alternately
presently
smalley
died
of
sunstroke
we
had
no
food
amongst
us
an
officer
kindly
lent
us
a
horse
we
were
very
faint
the
major

and
was
buried
also
the

some
women
the
bandsmen
left
us
on
the
nineteenth
of
june
we
were
fired
at
again
by
and
changed
direction
for
allahabad
our
party
consisted
of
nine
gentlemen
two
children
the
sergeant
and
his
wife
on
the
morning
of
the
twentieth
captain
scott
took
lottie
on
to
his
horse
i
was
riding
behind
my
husband
and
she
was
so
crushed
between
us
she
was
two
years
old
on
the
first
of
the
month
we
were
both
weak
through
want
of
food
and
the
effect
of
the
sun
lottie
and
i
had
no
head
covering
m
had
a
sepoy
cap
i
found
on
the
ground
soon
after
sunrise
we
were
followed
by
villagers
armed
with
clubs
and
spears
one
of
them
struck
captain
scott
horse
on
the
leg
he
galloped
off
with
lottie
and
my
poor
husband
never
saw
his
child
again
we
rode
on
several
miles
keeping
away
from
villages
and
then
crossed
the
river
our
thirst
was
extreme
m
had
dreadful
cramps
so
that
i
had
to
hold
him
on
the
horse
i
was
very
uneasy
about
him
the
day
before
i
saw
the
drummer
wife
eating
chupatties
and
asked
her
to
give
a
piece
to
the
child
which
she
did
i
now
saw
water
in
a
ravine
the
descent
was
steep
and
our
only
drinkingvessel
was
m
cap
our
horse
got
water
and
i
bathed
my
neck
i
had
no
stockings
and
my
feet
were
torn
and
blistered
two
peasants
came
in
sight
and
we
were
frightened
and
rode
off
the
sergeant
held
our
horse
and
m
put
me
up
and
mounted
i
think
he
must
have
got
suddenly
faint
for
i
fell
and
he
over
me
on
the
road
when
the
horse
started
off
some
time
before
he
said
and
barber
too
that
he
could
not
live
many
hours
i
felt
he
was
dying
before
we
came
to
the
ravine
he
told
me
his
wishes
about
his
children
and
myself
and
took
leave
my
brain
seemed
burnt
up
no
tears
came
as
soon
as
we
fell
the
sergeant
let
go
the
horse
and
it
went
off
so
that
escape
was
cut
off
we
sat
down
on
the
ground
waiting
for
death
poor
fellow
he
was
very
weak
his
thirst
was
frightful
and
i
went
to
get
him
water
some
villagers
came
and
took
my
rupees
and
watch
i
took
off
my
and
twisted
it
in
my
hair
and
replaced
the
guard
i
tore
off
the
skirt
of
my
dress
to
bring
water
in
but
was
no
use
for
when
i
returned
my
beloved
eyes
were
fixed
and
though
i
called
and
tried
to
restore
him
and
poured
water
into
his
mouth
it
only
rattled
in
his
throat
he
never
spoke
to
me
again
i
held
him
in
my
arms
till
he
sank
gradually
down
i
felt
frantic
but
could
not
cry
i
was
alone
i
bound
his
head
and
face
in
my
dress
for
there
was
no
earth
to
buy
him
the
pain
in
my
hands
and
feet
was
dreadful
i
went
down
to
the
ravine
and
sat
in
the
water
on
a
stone
hoping
to
get
off
at
night
and
look
for
lottie
when
i
came
back
from
the
water
i
saw
that
they
had
not
taken
her
little
watch
chain
and
seals
so
i
tied
them
under
my
petticoat
in
an
hour
about
thirty
villagers
came
they
dragged
me
out
of
the
ravine
and
took
off
my
jacket
and
found
the
little
chain
they
then
dragged
me
to
a
village
mocking
me
all
the
way
and
disputing
as
to
whom
i
was
to
belong
to
the
whole
population
came
to
look
at
me
i
asked
for
a
bedstead
and
lay
down
outside
the
door
of
a
hut
they
had
a
dozen
of
cows
and
yet
refused
me
milk
when
night
came
and
the
village
was
quiet
some
old
woman
brought
me
a
leafful
of
rice
i
was
too
parched
to
eat
and
they
gave
me
water
the
morning
after
a
neighboring
rajah
sent
a
palanquin
and
a
horseman
to
fetch
me
who
told
me
that
a
little
child
and
three
sahibs
had
come
to
his
master
house
and
so
the
poor
mother
found
her
lost
one
blistered
poor
little
creature
it
is
not
for
europeans
in
india
to
pray
that
their
flight
be
not
in
the
winter
in
the
first
days
of
june
the
aged
general
sir
hugh
wheeler
commanding
the
forces
at
cawnpore
was
deserted
by
his
native
troops
then
he
moved
out
of
the
fort
and
into
an
exposed
patch
of
open
flat
ground
and
built
a
mud
wall
around
it
he
had
with
him
a
few
hundred
white
soldiers
and
officers
and
apparently
more
women
and
children
than
soldiers
he
was
short
of
provisions
short
of
arms
short
of
ammunition
short
of
military
wisdom
short
of
everything
but
courage
and
devotion
to
duty
the
defense
of
that
open
lot
through
days
and
nights
of
hunger
thirst
indian
heat
and
a
storm
of
bullets
bombs
and
a
defense
conducted
not
by
the
aged
and
infirm
general
but
by
a
young
officer
named
moore
is
one
of
the
most
heroic
episodes
in
history
when
at
last
the
nana
found
it
impossible
to
conquer
these
starving
men
and
women
with
powder
and
ball
he
resorted
to
treachery
and
that
succeeded
he
agreed
to
supply
them
with
food
and
send
them
to
allahabad
in
boats
their
mud
wall
and
their
barracks
were
in
ruins
their
provisions
were
at
the
point
of
exhaustion
they
had
done
all
that
the
brave
could
do
they
had
conquered
an
honorable
compromise
their
forces
had
been
fearfully
reduced
by
casualties
and
by
disease
they
were
not
able
to
continue
the
contest
longer
they
came
forth
helpless
but
suspecting
no
treachery
the
host
closed
around
them
and
at
a
signal
from
a
trumpet
the
massacre
began
about
two
hundred
women
and
children
were
spared
for
the
present
but
all
the
men
except
three
or
four
were
killed
among
the
incidents
of
the
massacre
quoted
by
sir
trevelyan
is
this
when
after
the
lapse
of
some
twenty
minutes
the
dead
began
to
outnumber
the
living
when
the
fire
slackened
as
the
marks
grew
few
and
far
between
then
the
troopers
who
had
been
drawn
up
to
the
right
of
the
temple
plunged
into
the
river
sabre
between
teeth
and
pistol
in
hand
thereupon
two
christian
women
the
wives
of
musicians
in
the
band
of
the
witnessed
a
scene
which
should
not
be
related
at
the
boat
where
i
was
to
have
gone
says
bradshaw
confirmed
throughout
by
betts
the
and
misses
general
wheeler
came
last
in
a
palkee
they
carried
him
into
the
water
near
the
boat
i
stood
close
by
he
said
me
a
little
further
towards
the
boat
but
a
trooper
said
get
out
here
as
the
general
got
out
of
the
palkee
the
trooper
gave
him
a
cut
with
his
sword
into
the
neck
and
he
fell
into
the
water
my
son
was
killed
near
him
i
saw
it
alas
alas
some
were
stabbed
with
bayonets
others
cut
down
little
infants
were
torn
in
pieces
we
saw
it
we
did
and
tell
you
only
what
we
saw
other
children
were
stabbed
and
thrown
into
the
river
the
schoolgirls
were
burnt
to
death
i
saw
their
clothes
and
hair
catch
fire
in
the
water
a
few
paces
off
by
the
next
boat
we
saw
the
youngest
daughter
of
colonel
williams
a
sepoy
was
going
to
kill
her
with
his
bayonet
she
said
father
was
always
kind
to
sepoys
he
turned
away
and
just
then
a
villager
struck
her
on
the
head
with
a
club
and
she
fell
into
the
water
these
people
likewise
saw
good
moncrieff
the
clergyman
take
a
book
from
his
pocket
that
he
never
had
leisure
to
open
and
heard
him
commence
a
prayer
for
mercy
which
he
was
not
permitted
to
conclude
another
deponent
observed
an
european
making
for
a
drain
like
a
scared
when
some
boatmen
armed
with
cudgels
cut
off
his
retreat
and
beat
him
down
dead
into
the
mud
the
women
and
children
who
had
been
reserved
from
the
massacre
were
imprisoned
during
a
fortnight
in
a
small
building
one
story
high
a
cramped
place
a
slightly
modified
black
hole
of
calcutta
they
were
waiting
in
suspense
there
was
none
who
could
foretaste
their
fate
meantime
the
news
of
the
massacre
had
traveled
far
and
an
army
of
rescuers
with
havelock
at
its
head
was
on
its
way
at
least
an
army
which
hoped
to
be
rescuers
it
was
crossing
the
country
by
forced
marches
and
strewing
its
way
with
its
own
dead
men
struck
down
by
cholera
and
by
a
heat
which
reached
deg
it
was
in
a
vengeful
fury
and
it
stopped
for
nothing
neither
heat
nor
fatigue
nor
disease
nor
human
opposition
it
tore
its
impetuous
way
through
hostile
forces
winning
victory
after
victory
but
still
striding
on
and
on
not
halting
to
count
results
and
at
last
after
this
extraordinary
march
it
arrived
before
the
walls
of
cawnpore
met
the
nana
massed
strength
delivered
a
crushing
defeat
and
entered
but
too
late
only
a
few
hours
too
late
for
at
the
last
moment
the
nana
had
decided
upon
the
massacre
of
the
captive
women
and
children
and
had
commissioned
three
mohammedans
and
two
hindoos
to
do
the
work
sir
trevelyan
says
thereupon
the
five
men
entered
it
was
the
short
gloaming
of
hindostan
the
hour
when
ladies
take
their
evening
drive
she
who
had
accosted
the
officer
was
standing
in
the
doorway
with
her
were
the
native
doctor
and
two
hindoo
menials
that
much
of
the
business
might
be
seen
from
the
veranda
but
all
else
was
concealed
amidst
the
interior
gloom
shrieks
and
scuffing
acquainted
those
without
that
the
journeymen
were
earning
their
hire
survur
khan
soon
emerged
with
his
sword
broken
off
at
the
hilt
he
procured
another
from
the
nana
house
and
a
few
minutes
after
appeared
again
on
the
same
errand
the
third
blade
was
of
better
temper
or
perhaps
the
thick
of
the
work
was
already
over
by
the
time
darkness
had
closed
in
the
men
came
forth
and
locked
up
the
house
for
the
night
then
the
screams
ceased
but
the
groans
lasted
till
morning
the
sun
rose
as
usual
when
he
had
been
up
nearly
three
hours
the
five
repaired
to
the
scene
of
their
labors
over
night
they
were
attended
by
a
few
sweepers
who
proceeded
to
transfer
the
contents
of
the
house
to
a
dry
well
situated
behind
some
trees
which
grew
hard
by
bodies
says
one
who
was
present
throughout
dragged
out
most
of
them
by
the
hair
of
the
head
those
who
had
clothing
worth
taking
were
stripped
some
of
the
women
were
alive
i
can
not
say
how
many
but
three
could
speak
they
prayed
for
the
sake
of
god
that
an
end
might
be
put
to
their
sufferings
i
remarked
one
very
stout
woman
a
who
was
severely
wounded
in
both
arms
who
entreated
to
be
killed
she
and
two
or
three
others
were
placed
against
the
bank
of
the
cut
by
which
bullocks
go
down
in
drawing
water
the
dead
were
first
thrown
in
yes
there
was
a
great
crowd
looking
on
they
were
standing
along
the
walls
of
the
compound
they
were
principally
city
people
and
villagers
yes
there
were
also
sepoys
three
boys
were
alive
they
were
fair
children
the
eldest
i
think
must
have
been
six
or
seven
and
the
youngest
five
years
they
were
running
around
the
well
where
else
could
they
go
to
and
there
was
none
to
save
them
no
one
said
a
word
or
tried
to
save
them
at
length
the
smallest
of
them
made
an
infantile
attempt
to
get
away
the
little
thing
had
been
frightened
past
bearing
by
the
murder
of
one
of
the
surviving
ladies
he
thus
attracted
the
observation
of
a
native
who
flung
him
and
his
companions
down
the
well
the
soldiers
had
made
a
march
of
eighteen
days
almost
without
rest
to
save
the
women
and
the
children
and
now
they
were
too
late
all
were
dead
and
the
assassin
had
flown
what
happened
then
trevelyan
hesitated
to
put
into
words
of
what
took
place
the
less
said
is
the
better
then
he
continues
but
there
was
a
spectacle
to
witness
which
might
excuse
much
those
who
straight
from
the
contested
field
wandered
sobbing
through
the
rooms
of
the
ladies
house
saw
what
it
were
well
could
the
outraged
earth
have
straightway
hidden
the
inner
apartment
was
in
blood
the
plaster
was
scored
with
not
high
up
as
where
men
have
fought
but
low
down
and
about
the
corners
as
if
a
creature
had
crouched
to
avoid
the
blow
strips
of
dresses
vainly
tied
around
the
handles
of
the
doors
signified
the
contrivance
to
which
feminine
despair
had
resorted
as
a
means
of
keeping
out
the
murderers
broken
combs
were
there
and
the
frills
of
children
trousers
and
torn
cuffs
and
pinafores
and
little
round
hats
and
one
or
two
shoes
with
burst
latchets
and
one
or
two
daguerreotype
cases
with
cracked
glasses
an
officer
picked
up
a
few
curls
preserved
in
a
bit
of
cardboard
and
marked
hair
with
love
but
around
were
strewn
locks
some
near
a
yard
in
length
dissevered
not
as
a
keepsake
by
quite
other
scissors
the
battle
of
waterloo
was
fought
on
the
of
june
i
do
not
state
this
fact
as
a
reminder
to
the
reader
but
as
news
to
him
for
a
forgotten
fact
is
news
when
it
comes
again
writers
of
books
have
the
fashion
of
whizzing
by
vast
and
renowned
historical
events
with
the
remark
the
details
of
this
tremendous
episode
are
too
familiar
to
the
reader
to
need
repeating
here
they
know
that
that
is
not
true
it
is
a
low
kind
of
flattery
they
know
that
the
reader
has
forgotten
every
detail
of
it
and
that
nothing
of
the
tremendous
event
is
left
in
his
mind
but
a
vague
and
formless
luminous
smudge
aside
from
the
desire
to
flatter
the
reader
they
have
another
reason
for
making
the
reasons
indeed
they
do
not
remember
the
details
themselves
and
do
not
want
the
trouble
of
hunting
them
up
and
copying
them
out
also
they
are
afraid
that
if
they
search
them
out
and
print
them
they
will
be
scoffed
at
by
the
for
retelling
those
worn
old
things
which
are
familiar
to
everybody
they
should
not
mind
the
reviewer
jeer
he
does
remember
any
of
the
worn
old
things
until
the
book
which
he
is
reviewing
has
retold
them
to
him
i
have
made
the
quoted
remark
myself
at
one
time
and
another
but
i
was
not
doing
it
to
flatter
the
reader
i
was
merely
doing
it
to
save
work
if
i
had
known
the
details
without
brushing
up
i
would
have
put
them
in
but
i
did
and
i
did
not
want
the
labor
of
posting
myself
so
i
said
the
details
of
this
tremendous
episode
are
too
familiar
to
the
reader
to
need
repeating
here
i
do
not
like
that
kind
of
a
lie
still
it
does
save
work
i
am
not
trying
to
get
out
of
repeating
the
details
of
the
siege
of
lucknow
in
fear
of
the
reviewer
i
am
not
leaving
them
out
in
fear
that
they
would
not
interest
the
reader
i
am
leaving
them
out
partly
to
save
work
mainly
for
lack
of
room
it
is
a
pity
too
for
there
is
not
a
dull
place
anywhere
in
the
great
story
ten
days
before
the
outbreak
may
of
the
mutiny
all
was
serene
at
lucknow
the
huge
capital
of
oudh
the
kingdom
which
had
recently
been
seized
by
the
india
company
there
was
a
great
garrison
composed
of
about
native
troops
and
between
and
whites
these
white
soldiers
and
their
families
were
probably
the
only
people
of
their
race
there
at
their
elbow
was
that
swarming
population
of
warlike
natives
a
race
of
born
soldiers
brave
daring
and
fond
of
fighting
on
high
ground
just
outside
the
city
stood
the
palace
of
that
great
personage
the
resident
the
representative
of
british
power
and
authority
it
stood
in
the
midst
of
spacious
grounds
with
its
due
complement
of
outbuildings
and
the
grounds
were
enclosed
by
a
wall
a
wall
not
for
defense
but
for
privacy
the
mutinous
spirit
was
in
the
air
but
the
whites
were
not
afraid
and
did
not
feel
much
troubled
then
came
the
outbreak
at
meerut
then
the
capture
of
delhi
by
the
mutineers
in
june
came
the
leaguer
of
sir
hugh
wheeler
in
his
open
lot
at
cawnpore
miles
distant
from
lucknow
then
the
treacherous
massacre
of
that
gallant
little
garrison
and
now
the
great
revolt
was
in
full
flower
and
the
comfortable
condition
of
things
at
lucknow
was
instantly
changed
there
was
an
outbreak
there
and
sir
henry
lawrence
marched
out
of
the
residency
on
the
of
june
to
put
it
down
but
was
defeated
with
heavy
loss
and
had
difficulty
in
getting
back
again
that
night
the
memorable
siege
of
the
residency
called
the
siege
of
lucknow
began
sir
henry
was
killed
three
days
later
and
brigadier
inglis
succeeded
him
in
command
outside
of
the
residency
fence
was
an
immense
host
of
hostile
and
confident
native
besiegers
inside
it
were
loyal
native
soldiers
white
ones
and
women
and
children
in
those
days
the
english
garrisons
always
managed
to
hamper
themselves
sufficiently
with
women
and
children
the
natives
established
themselves
in
houses
close
at
hand
and
began
to
rain
bullets
and
into
the
residency
and
this
they
kept
up
night
and
day
during
four
months
and
a
half
the
little
garrison
industriously
replying
all
the
time
the
women
and
children
soon
became
so
used
to
the
roar
of
the
guns
that
it
ceased
to
disturb
their
sleep
the
children
imitated
siege
and
defense
in
their
play
the
women
with
any
pretext
or
with
none
would
sally
out
into
the
grounds
the
defense
was
kept
up
week
after
week
with
stubborn
fortitude
in
the
midst
of
death
which
came
in
many
forms
by
bullet
cholera
and
by
various
diseases
induced
by
unpalatable
and
insufficient
food
by
the
long
hours
of
wearying
and
exhausting
overwork
in
the
daily
and
nightly
battle
in
the
oppressive
indian
heat
and
by
the
broken
rest
caused
by
the
intolerable
pest
of
mosquitoes
flies
mice
rats
and
fleas
six
weeks
after
the
beginning
of
the
siege
more
than
of
the
original
force
of
white
soldiers
was
dead
and
close
upon
of
the
original
native
force
but
the
fighting
went
on
just
the
same
the
enemy
mined
the
english
and
turn
about
they
blew
up
each
other
posts
the
residency
grounds
were
with
the
enemy
tunnels
deadly
courtesies
were
constantly
exchanged
sorties
by
the
english
in
the
night
rushes
by
the
enemy
in
the
night
rushes
whose
purpose
was
to
breach
the
walls
or
scale
them
rushes
which
cost
heavily
and
always
failed
the
ladies
got
used
to
all
the
horrors
of
war
the
shrieks
of
mutilated
men
the
sight
of
blood
and
death
lady
inglis
makes
this
mention
in
her
diary
bruere
nurse
was
carried
past
our
door
wounded
in
the
eye
to
extract
the
bullet
it
was
found
necessary
to
take
out
the
eye
a
fearful
operation
her
mistress
held
her
while
it
was
performed
the
first
relieving
force
failed
to
relieve
it
was
under
havelock
and
outram
and
arrived
when
the
siege
had
been
going
on
for
three
months
it
fought
its
desperate
way
to
lucknow
then
fought
its
way
through
the
city
against
odds
of
a
hundred
to
one
and
entered
the
residency
but
there
was
not
enough
left
of
it
then
to
do
any
good
it
lost
more
men
in
its
last
fight
than
it
found
in
the
residency
when
it
got
in
it
became
captive
itself
the
fighting
and
starving
and
dying
by
bullets
and
disease
went
steadily
on
both
sides
fought
with
energy
and
industry
captain
birch
puts
this
striking
incident
in
evidence
he
is
speaking
of
the
third
month
of
the
siege
as
an
instance
of
the
heavy
firing
brought
to
bear
on
our
position
this
month
may
be
mentioned
the
cutting
down
of
the
upper
story
of
a
brick
building
simply
by
musketry
firring
this
building
was
in
a
most
exposed
position
all
the
shots
which
just
missed
the
top
of
the
rampart
cut
into
the
dead
wall
pretty
much
in
a
straight
line
and
at
length
cut
right
through
and
brought
the
upper
story
tumbling
down
the
upper
structure
on
the
top
of
the
also
fell
in
the
residency
house
was
a
wreck
captain
anderson
post
had
long
ago
been
knocked
down
and
innes
post
also
fell
in
these
two
were
riddled
with
round
shot
as
many
as
were
picked
up
by
colonel
masters
the
exhausted
garrison
fought
doggedly
on
all
through
the
next
month
october
then
november
news
came
sir
colin
campbell
relieving
force
would
soon
be
on
its
way
from
cawnpore
on
the
the
boom
of
his
guns
was
heard
on
the
the
sounds
came
nearer
he
was
slowly
but
steadily
cutting
his
way
through
storming
one
stronghold
after
another
on
the
he
captured
the
martiniere
college
and
ran
up
the
british
flag
there
it
was
seen
from
the
residency
next
he
took
the
dilkoosha
on
the
he
took
the
former
of
the
regiment
a
fortified
building
and
very
strong
a
most
exciting
anxious
day
writes
lady
inglis
in
her
diary
about
two
strange
officers
walked
through
our
yard
leading
their
horses
and
by
that
sign
she
knew
that
communication
was
established
between
the
forces
that
the
relief
was
real
this
time
and
that
the
long
siege
of
lucknow
was
ended
the
last
eight
or
ten
miles
of
sir
colin
campbell
march
was
through
seas
of
blood
the
weapon
mainly
used
was
the
bayonet
the
fighting
was
desperate
the
way
was
with
detached
strong
buildings
of
stone
fortified
and
heavily
garrisoned
and
these
had
to
be
taken
by
assault
neither
side
asked
for
quarter
and
neither
gave
it
at
the
secundrabagh
where
nearly
two
thousand
of
the
enemy
occupied
a
great
stone
house
in
a
garden
the
work
of
slaughter
was
continued
until
every
man
was
killed
that
is
a
sample
of
the
character
of
that
devastating
march
there
were
but
few
trees
in
the
plain
at
that
time
and
from
the
residency
the
progress
of
the
march
step
by
step
victory
by
victory
could
be
noted
the
ascending
clouds
of
marked
the
way
to
the
eye
and
the
thunder
of
the
guns
marked
it
to
the
ear
sir
colin
campbell
had
not
come
to
lucknow
to
hold
it
but
to
save
the
occupants
of
the
residency
and
bring
them
away
four
or
five
days
after
his
arrival
the
secret
evacuation
by
the
troops
took
place
in
the
middle
of
a
dark
night
by
the
principal
gate
the
bailie
guard
the
two
hundred
women
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
children
had
been
previously
removed
captain
birch
says
and
now
commenced
a
movement
of
the
most
perfect
arrangement
and
successful
generalship
the
withdrawal
of
the
whole
of
the
various
forces
a
combined
movement
requiring
the
greatest
care
and
skill
first
the
garrison
in
immediate
contact
with
the
enemy
at
the
furthest
extremity
of
the
residency
position
was
marched
out
every
other
garrison
in
turn
fell
in
behind
it
and
so
passed
out
through
the
bailie
guard
gate
till
the
whole
of
our
position
was
evacuated
then
havelock
force
was
similarly
withdrawn
post
by
post
marching
in
rear
of
our
garrison
after
them
in
turn
came
the
forces
of
the
which
joined
on
in
the
rear
of
havelock
force
regiment
by
regiment
was
withdrawn
with
the
utmost
order
and
regularity
the
whole
operation
resembled
the
movement
of
a
telescope
stern
silence
was
kept
and
the
enemy
took
no
alarm
lady
inglis
referring
to
her
husband
and
to
general
sir
james
outram
sets
down
the
closing
detail
of
this
impressive
midnight
retreat
in
darkness
and
by
stealth
of
this
shadowy
host
through
the
gate
which
it
had
defended
so
long
and
so
well
at
twelve
precisely
they
marched
out
john
and
sir
james
outram
remaining
till
all
had
passed
and
then
they
took
off
their
hats
to
the
bailie
guard
the
scene
of
as
noble
a
defense
as
i
think
history
will
ever
have
to
relate

they
are

may
still

but
you

wilson
new
calendar
often
the
surest
way
to
convey
misinformation
is
to
tell
the
strict
truth
wilson
new
calendar
we
were
driven
over
sir
colin
campbell
route
by
a
british
officer
and
when
i
arrived
at
the
residency
i
was
so
familiar
with
the
road
that
i
could
have
led
a
retreat
over
it
myself
but
the
compass
in
my
head
has
been
out
of
order
from
my
birth
and
so
as
soon
as
i
was
within
the
battered
bailie
guard
and
turned
about
to
review
the
march
and
imagine
the
relieving
forces
storming
their
way
along
it
everything
was
upside
down
and
wrong
end
first
in
a
moment
and
i
was
never
able
to
get
straightened
out
again
and
now
when
i
look
at
the
the
confusion
remains
in
me
the
east
was
born
west
the
which
have
the
east
on
the
side
are
of
no
use
to
me
the
residency
ruins
are
draped
with
flowering
vines
and
are
impressive
and
beautiful
they
and
the
grounds
are
sacred
now
and
will
suffer
no
neglect
nor
be
profaned
by
any
sordid
or
commercial
use
while
the
british
remain
masters
of
india
within
the
grounds
are
buried
the
dead
who
gave
up
their
lives
there
in
the
long
siege
after
a
fashion
i
was
able
to
imagine
the
fiery
storm
that
raged
night
and
day
over
the
place
during
so
many
months
and
after
a
fashion
i
could
imagine
the
men
moving
through
it
but
i
could
not
satisfactorily
place
the
women
and
i
could
do
nothing
at
all
with
the
children
i
knew
by
lady
inglis
diary
that
the
children
carried
on
their
small
affairs
very
much
as
if
blood
and
carnage
and
the
crash
and
thunder
of
a
siege
were
natural
and
proper
features
of
nursery
life
and
i
tried
to
realize
it
but
when
her
little
johnny
came
rushing
all
excitement
through
the
din
and
smoke
shouting
oh
mamma
the
white
hen
has
laid
an
egg
i
saw
that
i
could
not
do
it
johnny
place
was
under
the
bed
i
could
imagine
him
there
because
i
could
imagine
myself
there
and
i
think
i
should
not
have
been
interested
in
a
hen
that
was
laying
an
egg
my
interest
would
have
been
with
the
parties
that
were
laying
the
bombshells
i
sat
at
dinner
with
one
of
those
children
in
the
indian
palace
and
i
knew
that
all
through
the
siege
he
was
perfecting
his
teething
and
learning
to
talk
and
while
to
me
he
was
the
most
impressive
object
in
lucknow
after
the
residency
ruins
i
was
not
able
to
imagine
what
his
life
had
been
during
that
tempestuous
infancy
of
his
nor
what
sort
of
a
curious
surprise
it
must
have
been
to
him
to
be
marched
suddenly
out
into
a
strange
dumb
world
where
there
was
any
noise
and
nothing
going
on
he
was
only
when
i
saw
him
a
strangely
youthful
link
to
connect
the
present
with
so
ancient
an
episode
as
the
great
mutiny
by
and
by
we
saw
cawnpore
and
the
open
lot
which
was
the
scene
of
moore
memorable
defense
and
the
spot
on
the
shore
of
the
ganges
where
the
massacre
of
the
betrayed
garrison
occurred
and
the
small
indian
temple
whence
the
notified
the
assassins
to
fall
on
this
latter
was
a
lonely
spot
and
silent
the
sluggish
river
drifted
by
almost
currentless
it
was
dead
low
water
narrow
channels
with
vast
sandbars
between
all
the
way
across
the
wide
bed
and
the
only
living
thing
in
sight
was
that
grotesque
and
solemn
bird
the
adjutant
standing
on
his
stilts
solitary
on
a
distant
bar
with
his
head
sunk
between
his
shoulders
thinking
thinking
of
his
prize
i
suppose
the
dead
hindoo
that
lay
awash
at
his
feet
and
whether
to
eat
him
alone
or
invite
friends
he
and
his
prey
were
a
proper
accent
to
that
mournful
place
they
were
in
keeping
with
it
they
emphasized
its
loneliness
and
its
solemnity
and
we
saw
the
scene
of
the
slaughter
of
the
helpless
women
and
children
and
also
the
costly
memorial
that
is
built
over
the
well
which
contains
their
remains
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
is
gone
but
a
more
reverent
age
is
come
and
whatever
remembrancer
still
exists
of
the
moving
and
heroic
sufferings
and
achievements
of
the
garrisons
of
lucknow
and
cawnpore
will
be
guarded
and
preserved
in
agra
and
its
neighborhood
and
afterwards
at
delhi
we
saw
forts
mosques
and
tombs
which
were
built
in
the
great
days
of
the
mohammedan
emperors
and
which
are
marvels
of
cost
magnitude
and
richness
of
materials
and
ornamentation
creations
of
surpassing
grandeur
wonders
which
do
indeed
make
the
like
things
in
the
rest
of
the
world
seem
tame
and
inconsequential
by
comparison
i
am
not
purposing
to
describe
them
by
good
fortune
i
had
not
read
too
much
about
them
and
therefore
was
able
to
get
a
natural
and
rational
focus
upon
them
with
the
result
that
they
thrilled
blessed
and
exalted
me
but
if
i
had
previously
overheated
my
imagination
by
drinking
too
much
pestilential
literary
hot
scotch
i
should
have
suffered
disappointment
and
sorrow
i
mean
to
speak
of
only
one
of
these
many
buildings
the
taj
mahal
the
most
celebrated
construction
in
the
earth
i
had
read
a
great
deal
too
much
about
it
i
saw
it
in
the
daytime
i
saw
it
in
the
moonlight
i
saw
it
near
at
hand
i
saw
it
from
a
distance
and
i
knew
all
the
time
that
of
its
kind
it
was
the
wonder
of
the
world
with
no
competitor
now
and
no
possible
future
competitor
and
yet
it
was
not
my
taj
my
taj
had
been
built
by
excitable
literary
people
it
was
solidly
lodged
in
my
head
and
i
could
not
blast
it
out
i
wish
to
place
before
the
reader
some
of
the
usual
descriptions
of
the
taj
and
ask
him
to
take
note
of
the
impressions
left
in
his
mind
these
descriptions
do
really
state
the
truth
as
nearly
as
the
limitations
of
language
will
allow
but
language
is
a
treacherous
thing
a
most
unsure
vehicle
and
it
can
seldom
arrange
descriptive
words
in
such
a
way
that
they
will
not
inflate
the
facts
by
help
of
the
reader
imagination
which
is
always
ready
to
take
a
hand
and
work
for
nothing
and
do
the
bulk
of
it
at
that
i
will
begin
with
a
few
sentences
from
the
excellent
little
local
of
satya
chandra
mukerji
i
take
them
from
here
and
there
in
his
description
the
inlaid
work
of
the
taj
and
the
flowers
and
petals
that
are
to
be
found

the

with
its
beautiful

dream
of

on
the

sir
william
continues
i
will
italicize
some
of
his
words
the
mausoleum
stands
on
a
raised
marble
platform
at
each
of
whose
corners
rises
a
tall
and
slender
minaret
of
graceful
proportions
and
of
exquisite
beauty
beyond
the
platform
stretch
the
two
wings
one
of
which
is
itself
a
mosque
of
great
architectural
merit
in
the
center
of
the
whole
design
the
mausoleum
occupies
a
square
of
feet
with
the
angles
deeply
truncated
so
also
form
an
unequal
octagon
the
main
feature
in
this
central
pile
is
the
great
dome
which
swells
upward
to
nearly
of
a
sphere
and
tapers
at
its
extremity
into
a
pointed
spire
crowned
by
a
crescent
beneath
it
an
enclosure
of
marble
surrounds
the
tomb
of
the
princess
and
of
her
husband
the
emperor
each
corner
of
the
mausoleum
is
covered
by
a
similar
though
much
smaller
dome
erected
on
a
pediment
pierced
with
graceful
saracenic
arches
light
is
admitted
into
the
interior
through
a
double
screen
of
pierced
marble
which
tempers
the
glare
of
an
indian
sky
while
its
whiteness
prevents
the
mellow
effect
from
degenerating
into
gloom
the
internal
decorations
consist
of
inlaid
work
in
precious
stones
such
as
agate
jasper
with
which
every
squandril
or
salient
point
in
the
architecture
is
richly
fretted
brown
and
violet
marble
is
also
freely
employed
in
wreaths
scrolls
and
lintels
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
white
wall
in
regard
to
color
and
design
the
interior
of
the
taj
may
rank
first
in
the
world
for
purely
decorative
workmanship
while
the
perfect
symmetry
of
its
exterior
once
seen
can
never
be
forgotten
nor
the
aerial
grace
of
its
domes
rising
like
marble
bubbles
into
the
clear
sky
the
taj
represents
the
most
highly
elaborated
stage
of
ornamentation
reached
by
the
builders
the
stage
in
which
the
architect
ends
and
the
jeweler
begins
in
its
magnificent
gateway
the
diagonal
ornamentation
at
the
corners
which
satisfied
the
designers
of
the
gateways
of
and
sikandra
mausoleums
is
superseded
by
fine
marble
cables
in
bold
twists
strong
and
handsome
the
triangular
insertions
of
white
marble
and
large
flowers
have
in
like
manner
given
place
to
fine
inlaid
work
firm
perpendicular
lines
in
black
marble
with
well
proportioned
panels
of
the
same
material
are
effectively
used
in
the
interior
of
the
gateway
on
its
top
the
hindu
brackets
and
monolithic
architraves
of
sikandra
are
replaced
by
moorish
carped
arches
usually
single
blocks
of
red
sandstone
in
the
kiosks
and
pavilions
which
adorn
the
roof
from
the
pillared
pavilions
a
magnificent
view
is
obtained
of
the
taj
gardens
below
with
the
noble
jumna
river
at
their
farther
end
and
the
city
and
fort
of
agra
in
the
distance
from
this
beautiful
and
splendid
gateway
one
passes
up
a
straight
alley
shaded
by
evergreen
trees
cooled
by
a
broad
shallow
piece
of
water
running
along
the
middle
of
the
path
to
the
taj
itself
the
taj
is
entirely
of
marble
and
gems
the
red
sandstone
of
the
other
mohammedan
buildings
has
entirely
disappeared
or
rather
the
red
sandstone
which
used
to
form
the
thickness
of
the
walls
is
in
the
taj
itself
overlaid
completely
with
white
marble
and
the
white
marble
is
itself
inlaid
with
precious
stones
arranged
in
lovely
patterns
of
flowers
a
feeling
of
purity
impresses
itself
on
the
eye
and
the
mind
from
the
absence
of
the
coarser
material
which
forms
so
invariable
a
material
in
agra
architecture
the
lower
wall
and
panels
are
covered
with
tulips
oleanders
and
fullblown
lilies
in
flat
carving
on
the
white
marble
and
although
the
inlaid
work
of
flowers
done
in
gems
is
very
brilliant
when
looked
at
closely
there
is
on
the
whole
but
little
color
and
the
sentiment
is
one
of
whiteness
silence
and
calm
the
whiteness
is
broken
only
by
the
fine
color
of
the
inlaid
gems
by
lines
in
black
marble
and
by
delicately
written
inscriptions
also
in
black
from
the
koran
under
the
dome
of
the
vast
mausoleum
a
high
and
beautiful
screen
of
open
tracery
in
white
marble
rises
around
the
two
tombs
or
rather
cenotaphs
of
the
emperor
and
his
princess
and
in
this
marvel
of
marble
the
carving
has
advanced
from
the
old
geometrical
patterns
to
a
of
flowers
and
foliage
handled
with
great
freedom
and
spirit
the
two
cenotaphs
in
the
center
of
the
exquisite
enclosure
have
no
carving
except
the
plain
kalamdan
or
oblong
on
the
tomb
of
emperor
shah
jehan
but
both
cenotaphs
are
inlaid
with
flowers
made
of
costly
gems
and
with
the
ever
graceful
oleander
scroll
bayard
taylor
after
describing
the
details
of
the
taj
goes
on
to
say
on
both
sides
the
palm
the
banyan
and
the
feathery
bamboo
mingle
their
foliage
the
song
of
birds
meets
your
ears
and
the
odor
of
roses
and
lemon
flowers
sweetens
the
air
down
such
a
vista
and
over
such
a
foreground
rises
the
taj
there
is
no
mystery
no
sense
of
partial
failure
about
the
taj
a
thing
of
perfect
beauty
and
of
absolute
finish
in
every
detail
it
might
pass
for
the
work
of
genii
who
knew
naught
of
the
weaknesses
and
ills
with
which
mankind
are
beset
all
of
these
details
are
true
but
taken
together
they
state
a
falsehood
to
you
you
can
not
add
them
up
correctly
those
writers
know
the
values
of
their
words
and
phrases
but
to
you
the
words
and
phrases
convey
other
and
uncertain
values
to
those
writers
their
phrases
have
values
which
i
think
i
am
now
acquainted
with
and
for
the
help
of
the
reader
i
will
here
repeat
certain
of
those
words
and
phrases
and
follow
them
with
numerals
which
shall
represent
those
values
then
we
shall
see
the
difference
between
a
writer
ciphering
and
a
mistaken
reader
precious
stones
such
as
agate
jasper
with
which
every
salient
point
is
richly
fretted
first
in
the
world
for
purely
decorative
workmanship
the
taj
represents
the
stage
where
the
architect
ends
and
the
jeweler
begins
the
taj
is
entirely
of
marble
and
gems
inlaid
with
precious
stones
in
lovely
patterns
of
flowers
the
inlaid
work
of
flowers
done
in
gems
is
very
brilliant
followed
by
a
most
important
modification
which
the
reader
is
sure
to
read
too
carelessly
the
vast
mausoleum
this
marvel
of
marble
the
exquisite
enclosure
inlaid
with
flowers
made
of
costly
gems
a
thing
of
perfect
beauty
and
absolute
finish
those
details
are
correct
the
figures
which
i
have
placed
after
them
represent
quite
fairly
their
individual
values
then
why
as
a
whole
do
they
convey
a
false
impression
to
the
reader
it
is
because
the
reader
beguiled
by
his
heated
imagination
masses
them
in
the
wrong
way
the
writer
would
mass
the
first
three
figures
in
the
following
way
and
they
would
speak
the
truth
total
but
the
reader
masses
them
thus
and
then
they
tell
a
lie
the
writer
would
add
all
of
his
twelve
numerals
together
and
then
the
sum
would
express
the
whole
truth
about
the
taj
and
the
truth
only
but
the
reader
always
helped
by
his
imagination
would
put
the
figures
in
a
row
one
after
the
other
and
get
this
sum
which
would
tell
him
a
noble
big
lie
you
must
put
in
the
commas
yourself
i
have
to
go
on
with
my
work
the
reader
will
always
be
sure
to
put
the
figures
together
in
that
wrong
way
and
then
as
surely
before
him
will
stand
sparkling
in
the
sun
a
taj
tall
as
the
matterhorn
i
had
to
visit
niagara
fifteen
times
before
i
succeeded
in
getting
my
imaginary
falls
gauged
to
the
actuality
and
could
begin
to
sanely
and
wholesomely
wonder
at
them
for
what
they
were
not
what
i
had
expected
them
to
be
when
i
first
approached
them
it
was
with
my
face
lifted
toward
the
sky
for
i
thought
i
was
going
to
see
an
atlantic
ocean
pouring
down
thence
over
himalayan
heights
a
wall
of
water
sixty
miles
front
and
six
miles
high
and
so
when
the
toy
reality
came
suddenly
into
view
that
beruiled
little
wet
apron
hanging
out
to
dry
the
shock
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
fell
with
a
dull
thud
yet
slowly
surely
steadily
in
the
course
of
my
fifteen
visits
the
proportions
adjusted
themselves
to
the
facts
and
i
came
at
last
to
realize
that
a
waterfall
a
hundred
and
feet
high
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
was
an
impressive
thing
it
was
not
a
dipperful
to
my
vanished
great
vision
but
it
would
answer
i
know
that
i
ought
to
do
with
the
taj
as
i
was
obliged
to
do
with
niagara
see
it
fifteen
times
and
let
my
mind
gradually
get
rid
of
the
taj
built
in
it
by
its
describers
by
help
of
my
imagination
and
substitute
for
it
the
taj
of
fact
it
would
be
noble
and
fine
then
and
a
marvel
not
the
marvel
which
it
replaced
but
still
a
marvel
and
fine
enough
i
am
a
careless
reader
i
suppose
an
impressionist
reader
an
impressionist
reader
of
what
is
not
an
impressionist
picture
a
reader
who
overlooks
the
informing
details
or
masses
their
sum
improperly
and
gets
only
a
large
splashy
general
effect
an
effect
which
is
not
correct
and
which
is
not
warranted
by
the
particulars
placed
before
me
particulars
which
i
did
not
examine
and
whose
meanings
i
did
not
cautiously
and
carefully
estimate
it
is
an
effect
which
is
some
or
forty
times
finer
than
the
reality
and
is
therefore
a
great
deal
better
and
more
valuable
than
the
reality
and
so
i
ought
never
to
hunt
up
the
reality
but
stay
miles
away
from
it
and
thus
preserve
undamaged
my
own
private
mighty
niagara
tumbling
out
of
the
vault
of
heaven
and
my
own
ineffable
taj
built
of
tinted
mists
upon
jeweled
arches
of
rainbows
supported
by
colonnades
of
moonlight
it
is
a
mistake
for
a
person
with
an
unregulated
imagination
to
go
and
look
at
an
illustrious
world
wonder
i
suppose
that
many
many
years
ago
i
gathered
the
idea
that
the
place
in
the
achievements
of
man
was
exactly
the
place
of
the
in
the
achievements
of
nature
that
the
taj
represented
man
supremest
possibility
in
the
creation
of
grace
and
beauty
and
exquisiteness
and
splendor
just
as
the
represents
nature
supremest
possibility
in
the
combination
of
those
same
qualities
i
do
not
know
how
long
ago
that
idea
was
bred
in
me
but
i
know
that
i
can
not
remember
back
to
a
time
when
the
thought
of
either
of
these
symbols
of
gracious
and
unapproachable
perfection
did
not
at
once
suggest
the
other
if
i
thought
of
the
the
taj
rose
before
me
divinely
beautiful
if
i
thought
of
the
taj
with
its
encrustings
and
inlayings
of
jewels
the
vision
of
the
rose
and
so
to
me
all
these
years
the
taj
has
had
no
rival
among
the
temples
and
palaces
of
men
none
that
even
remotely
approached
it
it
was
man
architectural
here
in
london
the
other
night
i
was
talking
with
some
scotch
and
english
friends
and
i
mentioned
the
using
it
as
a
figure
a
figure
which
failed
for
none
of
them
had
heard
of
the
one
gentleman
who
was
very
familiar
with
american
literature
said
he
had
never
seen
it
mentioned
in
any
book
that
is
strange
and
i
myself
was
not
able
to
say
that
i
had
seen
it
mentioned
in
a
book
and
yet
the
autumn
foliage
with
all
other
american
scenery
has
received
full
and
competent
attention
the
oversight
is
strange
for
in
america
the
is
an
event
and
it
is
not
an
event
which
one
is
careless
about
when
it
comes
the
news
flies
from
room
to
room
in
the
house
there
are
bangings
on
the
doors
and
shoutings
the
the
and
even
the
laziest
sleepers
throw
off
the
covers
and
join
the
rush
for
the
windows
the
occurs
in
midwinter
and
usually
its
enchantments
are
wrought
in
the
silence
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
a
fine
drizzling
rain
falls
hour
after
hour
upon
the
naked
twigs
and
branches
of
the
trees
and
as
it
falls
it
freezes
in
time
the
trunk
and
every
branch
and
twig
are
incased
in
hard
pure
ice
so
that
the
tree
looks
like
a
skeleton
tree
made
all
of
glass
glass
that
is
all
along
the
underside
of
every
branch
and
twig
is
a
comb
of
little
icicles
the
frozen
drip
sometimes
these
pendants
do
not
quite
amount
to
icicles
but
are
round
beads
frozen
tears
the
weather
clears
toward
dawn
and
leaves
a
brisk
pure
atmosphere
and
a
sky
without
a
shred
of
cloud
in
it
and
everything
is
still
there
is
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
dawn
breaks
and
spreads
the
news
of
the
storm
goes
about
the
house
and
the
little
and
the
big
in
wraps
and
blankets
flock
to
the
window
and
press
together
there
and
gaze
intently
out
upon
the
great
white
ghost
in
the
grounds
and
nobody
says
a
word
nobody
stirs
all
are
waiting
they
know
what
is
coming
and
they
are
waiting
waiting
for
the
miracle
the
minutes
drift
on
and
on
and
on
with
not
a
sound
but
the
ticking
of
the
clock
at
last
the
sun
fires
a
sudden
sheaf
of
rays
into
the
ghostly
tree
and
turns
it
into
a
white
splendor
of
glittering
diamonds
everybody
catches
his
breath
and
feels
a
swelling
in
his
throat
and
a
moisture
in
his
waits
again
for
he
knows
what
is
coming
there
is
more
yet
the
sun
climbs
higher
and
still
higher
flooding
the
tree
from
its
loftiest
spread
of
branches
to
its
lowest
turning
it
to
a
glory
of
white
fire
then
in
a
moment
without
warning
comes
the
great
miracle
the
supreme
miracle
the
miracle
without
its
fellow
in
the
earth
a
gust
of
wind
sets
every
branch
and
twig
to
swaying
and
in
an
instant
turns
the
whole
white
tree
into
a
spouting
and
spraying
explosion
of
flashing
gems
of
every
conceivable
color
and
there
it
stands
and
sways
this
way
and
that
flash
flash
flash
a
dancing
and
glancing
world
of
rubies
emeralds
diamonds
sapphires
the
most
radiant
spectacle
the
most
blinding
spectacle
the
divinest
the
most
exquisite
the
most
intoxicating
vision
of
fire
and
color
and
intolerable
and
unimaginable
splendor
that
ever
any
eye
has
rested
upon
in
this
world
or
will
ever
rest
upon
outside
of
the
gates
of
heaven
by
all
my
senses
all
my
faculties
i
know
that
the
icestorm
is
supremest
achievement
in
the
domain
of
the
superb
and
the
beautiful
and
by
my
reason
at
least
i
know
that
the
taj
is
man
in
the
every
one
of
the
myriad
pendant
from
twig
and
branch
is
an
individual
gem
and
changes
color
with
every
motion
caused
by
the
wind
each
tree
carries
a
million
and
a
exhibits
the
splendors
of
the
single
tree
multiplied
by
a
thousand
it
occurs
to
me
now
that
i
have
never
seen
the
put
upon
canvas
and
have
not
heard
that
any
painter
has
tried
to
do
it
i
wonder
why
that
is
is
it
that
paint
can
not
counterfeit
the
intense
blaze
of
a
jewel
there
should
be
and
must
be
a
reason
and
a
good
one
why
the
most
enchanting
sight
that
nature
has
created
has
been
neglected
by
the
brush
often
the
surest
way
to
convey
misinformation
is
to
tell
the
strict
truth
the
describers
of
the
taj
have
used
the
word
gem
in
its
strictest
sense
its
scientific
sense
in
that
sense
it
is
a
mild
word
and
promises
but
little
to
the
bright
nothing
brilliant
nothing
sparkling
nothing
splendid
in
the
way
of
color
it
accurately
describes
the
sober
and
unobtrusive
of
the
taj
that
is
to
the
very
one
person
in
a
thousand
but
it
most
falsely
describes
it
to
the
but
the
are
the
people
who
ought
to
be
especially
taken
care
of
and
to
them
it
does
not
mean
designs
wrought
in
carnelians
or
agates
or
such
things
they
know
the
word
in
its
wide
and
ordinary
sense
only
and
so
to
them
it
means
diamonds
and
rubies
and
opals
and
their
kindred
and
the
moment
their
eyes
fall
upon
it
in
print
they
see
a
vision
of
glorious
colors
clothed
in
fire
these
describers
are
writing
for
the
general
and
so
in
order
to
make
sure
of
being
understood
they
ought
to
use
words
in
their
ordinary
sense
or
else
explain
the
word
fountain
means
one
thing
in
syria
where
there
is
but
a
handful
of
people
it
means
quite
another
thing
in
north
america
where
there
are
if
i
were
describing
some
syrian
scenery
and
should
exclaim
within
the
narrow
space
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
square
i
saw
in
the
glory
of
the
flooding
moonlight
two
hundred
noble
fountains
imagine
the
spectacle
the
north
american
would
have
a
vision
of
clustering
columns
of
water
soaring
aloft
bending
over
in
graceful
arches
bursting
in
beaded
spray
and
raining
white
fire
in
the
he
would
be
deceived
but
the
syrian
would
not
be
deceived
he
would
merely
see
two
hundred
springs
two
hundred
drowsing
puddles
as
level
and
unpretentious
and
unexcited
as
so
many
and
even
with
the
help
of
the
moonlight
he
would
not
lose
his
grip
in
the
presence
of
the
exhibition
my
word
fountain
would
be
correct
it
would
speak
the
strict
truth
and
it
would
convey
the
strict
truth
to
the
handful
of
syrians
and
the
strictest
misinformation
to
the
north
american
millions
with
their
gems
and
gems
and
more
gems
and
gems
again
and
still
other
gems
the
describers
of
the
taj
are
within
their
legal
but
not
their
moral
rights
they
are
dealing
in
the
strictest
scientific
truth
and
in
doing
it
they
succeed
to
admiration
in
telling
what

chapter
lx
satan
impatiently
to
the
trouble
with
you
chicago
people
is
that
you
think
you
are
the
best
people
down
here
whereas
you
are
merely
the
most
numerous
wilson
new
calendar
we
wandered
contentedly
around
here
and
there
in
india
to
lahore
among
other
places
where
the
lent
me
an
elephant
this
hospitality
stands
out
in
my
experiences
in
a
stately
isolation
it
was
a
fine
elephant
affable
gentlemanly
educated
and
i
was
not
afraid
of
it
i
even
rode
it
with
confidence
through
the
crowded
lanes
of
the
native
city
where
it
scared
all
the
horses
out
of
their
senses
and
where
children
were
always
just
escaping
its
feet
it
took
the
middle
of
the
road
in
a
fine
independent
way
and
left
it
to
the
world
to
get
out
of
the
way
or
take
the
consequences
i
am
used
to
being
afraid
of
collisions
when
i
ride
or
drive
but
when
one
is
on
top
of
an
elephant
that
feeling
is
absent
i
could
have
ridden
in
comfort
through
a
regiment
of
runaway
teams
i
could
easily
learn
to
prefer
an
elephant
to
any
other
vehicle
partly
because
of
that
immunity
from
collisions
and
partly
because
of
the
fine
view
one
has
from
up
there
and
partly
because
of
the
dignity
one
feels
in
that
high
place
and
partly
because
one
can
look
in
at
the
windows
and
see
what
is
going
on
privately
among
the
family
the
lahore
horses
were
used
to
elephants
but
they
were
rapturously
afraid
of
them
just
the
same
it
seemed
curious
perhaps
the
better
they
know
the
elephant
the
more
they
respect
him
in
that
peculiar
way
in
our
own
case
we
are
not
afraid
of
dynamite
till
we
get
acquainted
with
it
we
drifted
as
far
as
rawal
pindi
away
up
on
the
afghan
frontier
i
think
it
was
the
afghan
frontier
but
it
may
have
been
hertzegovina
it
was
around
there
somewhere
and
down
again
to
delhi
to
see
the
ancient
architectural
wonders
there
and
in
old
delhi
and
not
describe
them
and
also
to
see
the
scene
of
the
illustrious
assault
in
the
mutiny
days
when
the
british
carried
delhi
by
storm
one
of
the
marvels
of
history
for
impudent
daring
and
immortal
valor
we
had
a
refreshing
rest
there
in
delhi
in
a
great
old
mansion
which
possessed
historical
interest
it
was
built
by
a
rich
englishman
who
had
become
orientalized
so
much
so
that
he
had
a
zenana
but
he
was
a
broadminded
man
and
remained
so
to
please
his
harem
he
built
a
mosque
to
please
himself
he
built
an
english
church
that
kind
of
a
man
will
arrive
somewhere
in
the
mutiny
days
the
mansion
was
the
british
general
headquarters
it
stands
in
a
great
garden
oriental
fashion
and
about
it
are
many
noble
trees
the
trees
harbor
monkeys
and
they
are
monkeys
of
a
watchful
and
enterprising
sort
and
not
much
troubled
with
fear
they
invade
the
house
whenever
they
get
a
chance
and
carry
off
everything
they
do
want
one
morning
the
master
of
the
house
was
in
his
bath
and
the
window
was
open
near
it
stood
a
pot
of
yellow
paint
and
a
brush
some
monkeys
appeared
in
the
window
to
scare
them
away
the
gentleman
threw
his
sponge
at
them
they
did
not
scare
at
all
they
jumped
into
the
room
and
threw
yellow
paint
all
over
him
from
the
brush
and
drove
him
out
then
they
painted
the
walls
and
the
floor
and
the
tank
and
the
windows
and
the
furniture
yellow
and
were
in
the
painting
that
when
help
arrived
and
routed
them
two
of
these
creatures
came
into
my
room
in
the
early
morning
through
a
window
whose
shutters
i
had
left
open
and
when
i
woke
one
of
them
was
before
the
glass
brushing
his
hair
and
the
other
one
had
my
and
was
reading
a
page
of
humorous
notes
and
crying
i
did
not
mind
the
one
with
the
but
the
conduct
of
the
other
one
hurt
me
it
hurts
me
yet
i
threw
something
at
him
and
that
was
wrong
for
my
host
had
told
me
that
the
monkeys
were
best
left
alone
they
threw
everything
at
me
that
they
could
lift
and
then
went
into
the
bathroom
to
get
some
more
things
and
i
shut
the
door
on
them
at
jeypore
in
rajputana
we
made
a
considerable
stay
we
were
not
in
the
native
city
but
several
miles
from
it
in
the
small
european
official
suburb
there
were
but
few
europeans
only
fourteen
but
they
were
all
kind
and
hospitable
and
it
amounted
to
being
at
home
in
jeypore
we
found
again
what
we
had
found
all
about
india
that
while
the
indian
servant
is
in
his
way
a
very
real
treasure
he
will
sometimes
bear
watching
and
the
englishman
watches
him
if
he
sends
him
on
an
errand
he
wants
more
than
the
man
word
for
it
that
he
did
the
errand
when
fruit
and
vegetables
were
sent
to
us
a
chit
came
with
them
a
receipt
for
us
to
sign
otherwise
the
things
might
not
arrive
if
a
gentleman
sent
up
his
carriage
the
chit
stated
from
an
hour
to
an
hour
which
made
it
unhandy
for
the
coachman
and
his
two
or
three
subordinates
to
put
us
off
with
a
part
of
the
allotted
time
and
devote
the
rest
of
it
to
a
lark
of
their
own
we
were
pleasantly
situated
in
a
small
inn
in
an
empty
large
compound
which
was
surrounded
by
a
mud
wall
as
high
as
a
man
head
the
inn
was
kept
by
nine
hindoo
brothers
its
owners
they
lived
with
their
families
in
a
building
within
the
compound
but
off
to
one
side
and
there
was
always
a
long
pile
of
their
little
comely
brown
children
loosely
stacked
in
its
veranda
and
a
detachment
of
the
parents
wedged
among
them
smoking
the
hookah
or
the
howdah
or
whatever
they
call
it
by
the
veranda
stood
a
palm
and
a
monkey
lived
in
it
and
led
a
lonesome
life
and
always
looked
sad
and
weary
and
the
crows
bothered
him
a
good
deal
the
inn
cow
poked
about
the
compound
and
emphasized
the
secluded
and
country
air
of
the
place
and
there
was
a
dog
of
no
particular
breed
who
was
always
present
in
the
compound
and
always
asleep
always
stretched
out
baking
in
the
sun
and
adding
to
the
deep
tranquility
and
reposefulness
of
the
place
when
the
crows
were
away
on
business
servants
were
coming
and
going
all
the
time
but
they
seemed
only
spirits
for
their
feet
were
bare
and
made
no
sound
down
the
lane
a
piece
lived
an
elephant
in
the
shade
of
a
noble
tree
and
rocked
and
rocked
and
reached
about
with
his
trunk
begging
of
his
brown
mistress
or
fumbling
the
children
playing
at
his
feet
and
there
were
camels
about
but
they
go
on
velvet
feet
and
were
proper
to
the
silence
and
serenity
of
the
surroundings
the
satan
mentioned
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
was
not
our
satan
but
the
other
one
our
satan
was
lost
to
us
in
these
later
days
he
had
passed
out
of
our
life
lamented
by
me
and
sincerely
i
was
missing
him
i
am
missing
him
yet
after
all
these
months
he
was
an
astonishing
creature
to
fly
around
and
do
things
he
did
always
do
them
quite
right
but
he
did
them
and
did
them
suddenly
there
was
no
time
wasted
you
would
say
pack
the
trunks
and
bags
satan
wair
good
very
good
then
there
would
be
a
brief
sound
of
thrashing
and
slashing
and
humming
and
buzzing
and
a
spectacle
as
of
a
whirlwind
spinning
gowns
and
jackets
and
coats
and
boots
and
things
through
the
air
and
then
with
bow
and
touch
awready
master
it
was
wonderful
it
made
one
dizzy
he
crumpled
dresses
a
good
deal
and
he
had
no
particular
plan
about
the
work
at
first
except
to
put
each
article
into
the
trunk
it
did
belong
in
but
he
soon
reformed
in
this
matter
not
entirely
for
to
the
last
he
would
cram
into
the
satchel
sacred
to
literature
any
odds
and
ends
of
rubbish
that
he
could
find
a
handy
place
for
elsewhere
when
threatened
with
death
for
this
it
did
not
trouble
him
he
only
looked
pleasant
saluted
with
soldierly
grace
said
wair
good
and
did
it
again
next
day
he
was
always
busy
kept
the
rooms
tidied
up
the
boots
polished
the
clothes
brushed
the
full
of
clean
water
my
dress
clothes
laid
out
and
ready
for
the
an
hour
ahead
of
time
and
he
dressed
me
from
head
to
heel
in
spite
of
my
determination
to
do
it
myself
according
to
my
lifelong
custom
he
was
a
born
boss
and
loved
to
command
and
to
jaw
and
dispute
with
inferiors
and
harry
them
and
bullyrag
them
he
was
fine
at
the
railway
station
yes
he
was
at
his
finest
there
he
would
shoulder
and
plunge
and
paw
his
violent
way
through
the
packed
multitude
of
natives
with
nineteen
coolies
at
his
tail
each
bearing
a
trifle
of
luggage
one
a
trunk
another
a
parasol
another
a
shawl
another
a
fan
and
so
on
one
article
to
each
and
the
longer
the
procession
the
better
he
was
suited
and
he
was
sure
to
make
for
some
engaged
sleeper
and
begin
to
hurl
the
owner
things
out
of
it
swearing
that
it
was
ours
and
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
arrived
at
our
own
sleeper
he
would
undo
the
and
make
the
beds
and
put
everything
to
rights
and
shipshape
in
two
minutes
then
put
his
head
out
at
a
window
and
have
a
restful
good
time
abusing
his
gang
of
coolies
and
disputing
their
bill
until
we
arrived
and
made
him
pay
them
and
stop
his
noise
speaking
of
noise
he
certainly
was
the
noisest
little
devil
in
india
and
that
is
saying
much
very
much
indeed
i
loved
him
for
his
noise
but
the
family
detested
him
for
it
they
could
not
abide
it
they
could
not
get
reconciled
to
it
it
humiliated
them
as
a
rule
when
we
got
within
six
hundred
yards
of
one
of
those
big
railway
stations
a
mighty
racket
of
screaming
and
shrieking
and
shouting
and
storming
would
break
upon
us
and
i
would
be
happy
to
myself
and
the
family
would
say
with
shame
there
that
satan
why
do
you
keep
him
and
sure
enough
there
in
the
whirling
midst
of
fifteen
hundred
wondering
people
we
would
find
that
little
scrap
of
a
creature
gesticulating
like
a
spider
with
the
colic
his
black
eyes
snapping
his
dancing
his
jaws
pouring
out
floods
of
billingsgate
upon
his
gang
of
beseeching
and
astonished
coolies
i
loved
him
i
could
help
it
but
the
family
why
they
could
hardly
speak
of
him
with
patience
to
this
day
i
regret
his
loss
and
wish
i
had
him
back
but
they
it
is
different
with
them
he
was
a
native
and
came
from
surat
twenty
degrees
of
latitude
lay
between
his
birthplace
and
manuel
and
fifteen
hundred
between
their
ways
and
characters
and
dispositions
i
only
liked
manuel
but
i
loved
satan
this
real
name
was
intensely
indian
i
could
not
quite
get
the
hang
of
it
but
it
sounded
like
bunder
rao
ram
chunder
clam
chowder
it
was
too
long
for
handy
use
anyway
so
i
reduced
it
when
he
had
been
with
us
two
or
three
weeks
he
began
to
make
mistakes
which
i
had
difficulty
in
patching
up
for
him
approaching
benares
one
day
he
got
out
of
the
train
to
see
if
he
could
get
up
a
misunderstanding
with
somebody
for
it
had
been
a
weary
long
journey
and
he
wanted
to
freshen
up
he
found
what
he
was
after
but
kept
up
his
a
shade
too
long
and
got
left
so
there
we
were
in
a
strange
city
and
no
chambermaid
it
was
awkward
for
us
and
we
told
him
he
must
not
do
so
any
more
he
saluted
and
said
in
his
dear
pleasant
way
wair
good
then
at
lucknow
he
got
drunk
i
said
it
was
a
fever
and
got
the
family
compassion
and
solicitude
aroused
so
they
gave
him
a
teaspoonful
of
liquid
quinine
and
it
set
his
vitals
on
fire
he
made
several
grimaces
which
gave
me
a
better
idea
of
the
lisbon
earthquake
than
any
i
have
ever
got
of
it
from
paintings
and
descriptions
his
drunk
was
still
portentously
solid
next
morning
but
i
could
have
pulled
him
through
with
the
family
if
he
would
only
have
taken
another
spoonful
of
that
remedy
but
no
although
he
was
stupefied
his
memory
still
had
flickerings
of
life
so
he
smiled
a
divinely
dull
smile
and
said
fumblingly
saluting
scoose
me
mem
saheb
scoose
me
missy
saheb
satan
not
prefer
it
please
then
some
instinct
revealed
to
them
that
he
was
drunk
they
gave
him
prompt
notice
that
next
time
this
happened
he
must
go
he
got
out
a
maudlin
and
most
gentle
wair
good
and
saluted
indefinitely
only
one
short
week
later
he
fell
again
and
oh
sorrow
not
in
a
hotel
this
time
but
in
an
english
gentleman
private
house
and
in
agra
of
all
places
so
he
had
to
go
when
i
told
him
he
said
patiently
wair
good
and
made
his
parting
salute
and
went
out
from
us
to
return
no
more
forever
dear
me
i
would
rather
have
lost
a
hundred
angels
than
that
one
poor
lovely
devil
what
style
he
used
to
put
on
in
a
swell
hotel
or
in
a
private
house
muslin
from
his
chin
to
his
bare
feet
a
crimson
sash
embroidered
with
gold
thread
around
his
waist
and
on
his
head
a
great
turban
like
to
the
turban
of
the
grand
turk
he
was
not
a
liar
but
he
will
become
one
if
he
keeps
on
he
told
me
once
that
he
used
to
crack
cocoanuts
with
his
teeth
when
he
was
a
boy
and
when
i
asked
how
he
got
them
into
his
mouth
he
said
he
was
upward
of
six
feet
high
at
that
time
and
had
an
unusual
mouth
and
when
i
followed
him
up
and
asked
him
what
had
become
of
that
other
foot
he
said
a
house
fell
on
him
and
he
was
never
able
to
get
his
stature
back
again
swervings
like
these
from
the
strict
line
of
fact
often
beguile
a
truthful
man
on
and
on
until
he
eventually
becomes
a
liar
his
successor
was
a
mohammedan
sahadat
mohammed
khan
very
dark
very
tall
very
grave
he
went
always
in
flowing
masses
of
white
from
the
top
of
his
big
turban
down
to
his
bare
feet
his
voice
was
low
he
glided
about
in
a
noiseless
way
and
looked
like
a
ghost
he
was
competent
and
satisfactory
but
where
he
was
it
seemed
always
sunday
it
was
not
so
in
satan
time
jeypore
is
intensely
indian
but
it
has
two
or
three
features
which
indicate
the
presence
of
european
science
and
european
interest
in
the
weal
of
the
common
public
such
as
the
liberal
furnished
by
great
works
built
at
the
state
expense
good
sanitation
resulting
in
a
degree
of
healthfulness
unusually
high
for
india
a
noble
pleasure
garden
with
privileged
days
for
women
schools
for
the
instruction
of
native
youth
in
advanced
art
both
ornamental
and
utilitarian
and
a
new
and
beautiful
palace
stocked
with
a
museum
of
extraordinary
interest
and
value
without
the
maharaja
sympathy
and
purse
these
beneficences
could
not
have
been
created
but
he
is
a
man
of
wide
views
and
large
generosities
and
all
such
matters
find
hospitality
with
him
we
drove
often
to
the
city
from
the
hotel
a
journey
which
was
always
full
of
interest
both
night
and
day
for
that
country
road
was
never
quiet
never
empty
but
was
always
india
in
motion
always
a
streaming
flood
of
brown
people
clothed
in
smouchings
from
the
rainbow
a
tossing
and
moiling
flood
happy
noisy
a
charming
and
satisfying
confusion
of
strange
human
and
strange
animal
life
and
equally
strange
and
outlandish
vehicles
and
the
city
itself
is
a
curiosity
any
indian
city
is
that
but
this
one
is
not
like
any
other
that
we
saw
it
is
shut
up
in
a
lofty
turreted
wall
the
main
body
of
it
is
divided
into
six
parts
by
perfectly
straight
streets
that
are
more
than
a
hundred
feet
wide
the
blocks
of
houses
exhibit
a
long
frontage
of
the
most
taking
architectural
quaintnesses
the
straight
lines
being
broken
everywhere
by
pretty
little
balconies
pillared
and
highly
ornamented
and
other
cunning
and
cozy
and
inviting
perches
and
projections
and
many
of
the
fronts
are
curiously
pictured
by
the
brush
and
the
whole
of
them
have
the
soft
rich
tint
of
strawberry
one
can
not
look
down
the
far
stretch
of
the
chief
street
and
persuade
himself
that
these
are
real
houses
and
that
it
is
all
out
of
doors
the
impression
that
it
is
an
unreality
a
picture
a
scene
in
a
theater
is
the
only
one
that
will
take
hold
then
there
came
a
great
day
when
this
illusion
was
more
pronounced
than
ever
a
rich
hindoo
had
been
spending
a
fortune
upon
the
manufacture
of
a
crowd
of
idols
and
accompanying
paraphernalia
whose
purpose
was
to
illustrate
scenes
in
the
life
of
his
especial
god
or
saint
and
this
fine
show
was
to
be
brought
through
the
town
in
processional
state
at
ten
in
the
morning
as
we
passed
through
the
great
public
pleasure
garden
on
our
way
to
the
city
we
found
it
crowded
with
natives
that
was
one
sight
then
there
was
another
in
the
midst
of
the
spacious
lawns
stands
the
palace
which
contains
the
museum
a
beautiful
construction
of
stone
which
shows
arched
colonnades
one
above
another
and
receding
toward
the
sky
every
one
of
these
terraces
all
the
way
to
the
top
one
was
packed
and
jammed
with
natives
one
must
try
to
imagine
those
solid
masses
of
splendid
color
one
above
another
up
and
up
against
the
blue
sky
and
the
indian
sun
turning
them
all
to
beds
of
fire
and
flame
later
when
we
reached
the
city
and
glanced
down
the
chief
avenue
smouldering
in
its
tint
those
splendid
effects
were
repeated
for
every
balcony
and
every
fanciful
of
a
snuggery
countersunk
in
the
and
all
the
long
lines
of
roofs
were
crowded
with
people
and
each
crowd
was
an
explosion
of
brilliant
color
then
the
wide
street
itself
away
down
and
down
and
down
into
the
distance
was
alive
with
people
not
still
but
moving
swaying
drifting
eddying
a
delirious
display
of
all
colors
and
all
shades
of
color
delicate
lovely
pale
soft
strong
stunning
vivid
brilliant
a
sort
of
storm
of
sweetpea
blossoms
passing
on
the
wings
of
a
hurricane
and
presently
through
this
storm
of
color
came
swaying
and
swinging
the
majestic
elephants
clothed
in
their
sunday
best
of
gaudinesses
and
the
long
procession
of
fanciful
trucks
freighted
with
their
groups
of
curious
and
costly
images
and
then
the
long
rearguard
of
stately
camels
with
their
picturesque
riders
for
color
and
picturesqueness
and
novelty
and
outlandishness
and
sustained
interest
and
fascination
it
was
the
most
satisfying
show
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
suppose
i
shall
not
have
the
privilege
of
looking
upon
its
like
again
