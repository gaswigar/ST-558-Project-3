dave
stared
around

he
went
to
the
window
and
stared
upwards
at
the
crazy
patchwork
of
the
sky
for
all
he
knew
in
such
a
sky
there
might
be
cracks
in

as
he
looked
he
could
make
out
a
rift
and
beyond
that
a
hole
a
small
patch

there
was
no

and
yet
the
sky
there
was
not

there
were
no

by
the
power
of
the
true
name
be
summoned
cells
and
humors
ka
and
id
self
and
dave
hanson
the
name
came
swimming
through
utter
blackness
sucking
at
him
pulling
him
together
out
of
nothingness
then
abruptly
he
was
aware
of
being
alive
and
surprised
he
sucked
in
on
the
air
around
him
and
the
breath
burned
in
his
lungs
he
was
one
of
the
dead
there
should
be
no
quickening
of
breath
within
him
he
caught
a
grip
on
himself
fighting
the
fantasies
of
his
mind
and
took
another
breath
of
air
this
time
it
burned
less
and
he
could
force
an
awareness
of
the
smells
around
him
but
there
was
none
of
the
pungent
odor
of
the
hospital
he
had
expected
instead
his
nostrils
were
scorched
with
a
noxious
odor
of
sulfur
burned
hair
and
cloying
incense
he
gagged
on
it
his
diaphragm
tautened
with
the
sharp
pain
of
muscles
and
he
sneezed
a
good
sign
a
man
voice
said
the
followers
have
accepted
and
are
leaving
only
a
true
being
can
sneeze
but
unless
the
salamander
works
his
chances
are
only
slight
there
was
a
mutter
of
agreement
from
others
before
an
older
voice
broke
in
it
takes
a
deeper
fire
than
most
salamanders
can
stir
ser
perth
we
might
aid
it
with
radiation
but
i
distrust
the
effects
on
the
prepsyche
if
we
tried
a
tamed
succubus
the
things
are
untrustworthy
the
first
voice
answered
and
with
the
sky
falling
we
dare
not
trust
one
the
words
blurred
off
in
a
fog
of
semiconsciousness
and
the
sky
was
falling
who
killed
foxy
loxy
i
said
the
spider
who
sat
down
insider
i
went
boomp
in
the
night
and
the
bull
jumped
over
the
moon
bull
he
croaked
the
bull
sleeper
delirious
the
first
voice
muttered
i
mean
bull
pusher
that
was
wrong
too
and
he
tried
again
forcing
his
reluctant
tongue
around
the
syllables
bull
damn
it
could
he
even
pronounce
simple
engaliss
the
language
was
english
however
nor
was
it
canadian
french
the
only
other
speech
he
could
make
any
sense
of
yet
he
understood
it
had
even
spoken
it
he
realized
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
his
command
of
whatever
language
it
was
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
word
for
bulldozer
he
struggled
to
get
his
eyes
open
the
room
seemed
normal
enough
in
spite
of
the
odd
smells
he
lay
on
a
high
bed
surrounded
by
prim
white
walls
and
there
was
even
a
chart
of
some
kind
at
the
bottom
of
the
bedframe
he
focused
his
eyes
slowly
on
what
must
be
the
doctors
and
nurses
there
and
their
faces
looked
back
with
the
proper
professional
worry
but
the
varicolored
gowns
they
wore
in
place
of
proper
clothing
were
covered
with
odd
designs
stars
crescents
and
things
that
might
have
been
symbols
for
astronomy
or
chemistry
he
tried
to
reach
for
his
glasses
to
adjust
them
there
were
no
glasses
that
hit
him
harder
than
any
other
discovery
he
must
be
delirious
and
imagining
the
room
dave
hanson
was
so
nearsighted
that
he
have
seen
the
men
much
less
the
clothing
without
corrective
lenses
the
man
with
the
small
mustache
bent
over
the
chart
near
his
feet
hmm
the
man
said
in
the
voice
of
the
first
speaker
mars
trines
neptune
and
with
scorpio
so
altered
hmm
better
add
two
cc
of
cortisone
to
the
transfusion
hanson
tried
to
sit
up
but
his
arms
refused
to
bear
his
weight
he
opened
his
mouth
a
slim
hand
came
to
his
lips
and
he
looked
up
into
soothing
blue
eyes
the
nurse
face
was
framed
in
hair
she
had
the
transparent
skin
and
classic
features
that
occur
once
in
a
million
times
but
which
still
keep
the
legend
of
redheaded
enchantresses
alive
shh
she
said
he
began
to
struggle
against
her
hand
but
she
shook
her
head
gently
her
other
hand
began
a
series
of
complicated
motions
that
had
a
ritualistic
look
about
them
shh
she
repeated
rest
relax
and
sleep
dave
hanson
and
remember
when
you
were
alive
there
was
a
sharp
sound
from
the
doctor
but
it
began
to
blur
out
before
hanson
could
understand
it
he
fought
to
remember
what
he
heard
the
nurse
say
something
about
when
he
was
alive
as
if
he
been
dead
a
long
time
he
could
hold
the
thought
at
a
final
rapid
motion
of
the
girl
hand
his
eyes
closed
the
smell
faded
from
his
nose
and
all
sounds
vanished
once
there
was
a
stinging
sensation
as
if
he
were
receiving
the
transfusion
then
he
was
alone
in
his
mind
with
his
memories
mostly
of
the
last
day
when
he
still
been
alive
he
seemed
to
be
reliving
the
events
rethinking
the
thoughts
he
had
then
it
began
with
the
sight
of
his
uncle
face
leering
at
him
uncle
david
arnold
hanson
looked
like
every
man
dream
of
himself
and
every
dreams
of
manliness
but
at
the
moment
to
dave
he
looked
more
like
a
personal
demon
his
head
was
tilted
back
and
nasty
laughter
was
booming
through
the
air
of
the
little
office
so
your
girl
writes
that
your
little
farewell
activity
did
fare
so
well
eh
he
chortled
and
you
come
crawling
here
to
tell
me
you
want
to
do
the
honorable
thing
is
that
it
all
right
my
beloved
nephew
you
do
the
honorable
thing
you
stick
to
your
contract
with
me
but
dave
began
but
if
you
do
you
better
read
it
again
you
do
get
one
cent
except
on
completion
of
your
year
with
me
that
what
it
says
and
that
what
happens
he
paused
letting
the
fact
that
he
meant
it
sink
in
he
was
enjoying
the
whole
business
and
in
no
hurry
to
end
it
and
i
happen
to
know
dave
that
you
do
even
have
fare
to
saskatchewan
left
you
quit
and
i
see
you
never
get
another
job
i
promised
my
sister
i
make
a
man
of
you
and
by
jumping
jupiter
i
intend
to
do
just
that
and
in
my
book
that
does
mean
you
run
back
with
your
tail
between
your
legs
just
because
some
silly
young
girl
pulls
that
old
chestnut
on
you
why
when
i
was
your
age
i
already
had
dave
was
listening
any
longer
in
futile
anger
he
swung
out
of
the
office
and
gone
stumbling
back
toward
the
computer
building
then
in
a
further
burst
of
anger
he
swung
off
the
trail
to
hell
with
his
work
and
blast
his
uncle
he
go
on
into
town
and
he
he
do
whatever
he
pleased
the
worst
part
of
it
was
that
uncle
david
could
make
good
on
his
threat
of
seeing
that
dave
got
no
more
work
anywhere
david
arnold
hanson
was
a
power
to
reckon
with
no
other
man
on
earth
could
have
persuaded
anyone
to
let
him
try
his
scheme
of
building
a
great
deflection
wall
across
northern
canada
to
change
the
weather
patterns
and
no
other
man
could
have
accomplished
the
impossible
task
even
after
twelve
countries
pooled
their
resources
to
give
him
the
job
but
he
was
doing
it
and
it
was
already
beginning
to
work
dave
had
noticed
that
the
last
winter
in
chicago
had
definitely
shown
that
uncle
david
predictions
were
coming
true
like
most
of
the
world
dave
had
regarded
the
big
man
who
was
his
uncle
with
something
close
to
worship
he
jumped
at
the
chance
to
work
under
uncle
david
and
he
been
a
fool
he
been
doing
all
right
in
chicago
repairing
computers
did
pay
a
fortune
but
it
was
a
good
living
and
he
was
good
at
it
and
there
was
bertha
maybe
not
a
movie
doll
but
a
sort
of
pretty
girl
who
was
also
a
darned
good
cook
for
a
man
of
thirty
who
always
been
a
scrawny
shy
runt
like
the
one
in
the
before
pictures
he
been
doing
all
right
then
came
the
letter
from
his
uncle
offering
him
triple
salary
as
a
maintenance
man
on
the
computers
used
for
the
construction
job
there
was
nothing
said
about
romance
and
beauteous
indian
maids
but
dave
filled
that
in
himself
he
would
need
the
money
when
he
and
bertha
got
married
too
and
all
that
healthy
outdoor
living
was
just
what
the
doctor
would
have
ordered
the
indian
maids
of
course
turned
out
to
be
a
few
fat
old
squaws
who
knew
all
about
white
men
the
outdoor
living
developed
into
five
months
of
rain
hail
sleet
blizzard
fog
and
constant
freezing
in
tractors
while
breathing
the
healthy
fumes
of
diesels
uncle
david
turned
out
to
be
a
construction
genius
all
right
but
his
interest
in
dave
seemed
to
lie
in
the
fact
that
he
was
tired
of
being
simon
legree
to
strangers
and
wanted
to
take
it
out
on
one
of
his
own
family
and
the
easy
job
turned
into
hell
when
the
regular
could
take
any
more
and
quit
leaving
dave
to
do
everything
including
making
the
field
tests
to
gain
the
needed
data
now
bertha
was
writing
frantic
letters
telling
him
how
much
he
better
come
back
and
marry
her
immediately
and
uncle
david
thought
it
was
a
joke
dave
paid
no
attention
to
where
his
feet
were
leading
him
only
vaguely
aware
that
he
was
heading
down
a
gully
below
the
current
construction
job
he
heard
the
tractors
and
bulldozers
moving
along
the
narrow
cliff
above
him
but
he
was
used
to
the
sound
he
heard
frantic
yelling
from
above
too
but
paid
no
attention
to
it
in
any
hanson
construction
program
somebody
was
always
yelling
about
something
that
had
to
be
done
day
before
yesterday
it
was
until
he
finally
became
aware
of
his
own
name
being
shouted
that
he
looked
up
then
he
froze
in
horror
the
bulldozer
was
teetering
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
as
he
saw
it
right
above
him
and
the
cliff
was
crumbling
from
under
it
while
the
tread
spun
idiotically
out
of
control
as
dave
eyes
took
in
the
whole
situation
the
cliff
crumbled
completely
and
the
dozer
came
lunging
over
the
edge
plunging
straight
for
him
his
shout
was
drowned
in
the
roar
of
the
motor
he
tried
to
force
his
legs
to
jump
but
they
were
frozen
in
terror
the
heavy
mass
came
straight
for
him
its
treads
churning
like
great
teeth
reaching
for
him
then
it
hit
squarely
on
top
of
him
something
ripped
and
splattered
and
blacked
out
in
an
unbearable
welter
of
agony
dave
hanson
came
awake
trying
to
scream
and
thrusting
at
the
bed
with
arms
too
weak
to
raise
him
the
dream
of
the
past
was
already
fading
the
horror
he
had
thought
was
death
lay
somewhere
in
the
past
now
he
was
here
wherever
here
was
the
obvious
answer
was
that
he
was
in
a
normal
hospital
somehow
still
alive
being
patched
up
the
things
he
seemed
to
remember
from
his
other
waking
must
be
a
mixture
of
fact
and
delirium
besides
how
was
he
to
judge
what
was
normal
in
extreme
cases
of
surgery
he
managed
to
struggle
up
to
a
sitting
position
in
the
bed
trying
to
make
out
more
of
his
surroundings
but
the
room
was
dark
now
as
his
eyes
adjusted
he
made
out
a
small
brazier
there
with
a
cadaverous
old
man
in
a
dark
robe
spotted
with
looped
crosses
on
his
head
was
something
like
a
miter
carrying
a
coiled
brass
snake
in
front
of
it
the
old
man
white
goatee
bobbed
as
he
mouthed
something
silently
and
made
passes
over
the
flame
which
shot
up
prismatically
clouds
of
white
fire
belched
up
dave
reached
to
adjust
his
glasses
and
found
again
that
he
wearing
them
but
he
never
seen
so
clearly
before
at
that
moment
a
chanting
voice
broke
into
his
puzzled
thoughts
it
sounded
like
ser
perth
dave
turned
his
head
weakly
the
motion
set
sick
waves
of
nausea
running
through
him
but
he
could
see
the
doctor
kneeling
on
the
floor
in
some
sort
of
pantomime
the
words
of
the
chant
were
meaningless
a
hand
closed
over
dave
eyes
and
the
voice
of
the
nurse
whispered
in
his
ear
shh
dave
hanson
it
the
sather
karf
so
do
interrupt
there
may
be
a
conjunction
he
fell
back
panting
his
heart
fluttering
whatever
was
going
on
he
was
in
no
shape
to
interrupt
anything
but
he
knew
that
this
was
no
delirium
he
did
have
that
kind
of
imagination
the
chant
changed
after
a
long
moment
of
silence
dave
heart
had
picked
up
speed
but
now
it
missed
again
and
he
felt
cold
he
shivered
hell
or
heaven
were
like
this
either
it
was
like
something
out
of
some
picture
something
about
cagliostro
the
ancient
mystic
but
he
was
sure
the
language
he
somehow
spoke
was
an
ancient
one
it
had
words
for
electron
penicillin
and
calculus
for
he
found
them
in
his
own
mind
the
chant
picked
up
again
and
now
the
brazier
flamed
a
dull
red
showing
the
sather
karf
face
changing
from
some
kind
of
disappointment
to
a
businesslike
steadiness
the
red
glow
grew
white
in
the
center
and
a
fat
shape
of
flame
came
into
being
the
old
man
picked
it
up
in
his
hand
petted
it
and
carried
it
toward
dave
it
flowed
toward
his
chest
he
pulled
himself
back
but
ser
perth
and
the
nurse
leaped
forward
to
hold
him
the
thing
started
to
grow
brighter
it
shone
now
like
a
tiny
bit
of
metal
but
the
older
man
touched
it
and
it
snuggled
down
into
dave
chest
dimming
its
glow
and
somehow
purring
warmth
seemed
to
flow
from
it
into
dave
the
two
men
watched
for
a
moment
then
picked
up
their
apparatus
and
turned
to
go
the
sather
karf
lifted
the
fire
from
the
brazier
in
his
bare
hand
moved
it
into
the
air
and
said
a
soft
word
it
vanished
and
the
two
men
were
also
gone
magic
dave
said
he
seen
such
illusions
created
on
the
stage
but
there
was
something
different
here
and
there
was
no
fakery
about
the
warmth
from
the
thing
over
his
chest
abruptly
he
remembered
that
come
across
something
like
it
called
a
salamander
in
fiction
once
the
thing
was
supposed
to
be
a
spirit
of
fire
and
dangerously
destructive
the
girl
nodded
in
the
soft
glow
coming
from
dave
chest
naturally
she
told
him
how
else
does
one
produce
and
control
a
salamander
except
by
magic
without
magic
how
can
we
thaw
a
frozen
soul
or
did
your
world
have
any
sciences
dave
hanson
either
the
five
months
under
his
uncle
had
toughened
him
or
the
sight
of
the
bulldozer
falling
had
knocked
him
beyond
any
strong
reaction
the
girl
had
practically
told
him
he
was
in
his
own
world
he
waited
for
some
emotion
felt
none
and
shrugged
the
action
sent
pain
running
through
him
but
he
stood
it
somehow
the
salamander
ceased
its
purring
then
resumed
where
in
hell
am
i
he
asked
or
when
she
shook
her
head
hell
no
i
do
think
so
some
say
it
earth
and
some
call
it
terah
but
nobody
calls
it
hell
it
well
it
a
long
time
i
guess
from
when
you
were
i
do
know
in
such
matters
only
the
satheri
know
the
dual
is
closed
even
to
the
seri
anyhow
not
your
though
some
say
it
your
world
you
mean
dimensional
travel
dave
asked
he
seen
something
about
that
on
a
television
program
it
made
even
time
travel
seem
simple
at
any
event
however
this
was
a
hospital
in
any
sane
and
normal
section
of
canada
during
his
time
on
earth
something
like
that
she
agreed
doubtfully
but
go
to
sleep
now
shh
her
hands
came
up
in
complicated
gestures
sleep
and
grow
well
none
of
that
hypnotism
again
he
protested
she
went
on
making
passes
but
smiled
on
him
kindly
do
be
superstitious
hypnotism
is
silly
now
go
to
sleep
for
me
dave
hanson
i
want
you
well
and
true
when
you
awake
against
his
will
his
eyes
closed
and
his
lips
refused
to
obey
his
desire
to
protest
fatigue
dulled
his
thoughts
but
for
a
moment
he
went
on
pondering
somebody
from
the
future
this
could
never
be
the
past
had
somehow
pulled
him
out
just
ahead
of
the
accident
apparently
or
else
he
been
deep
frozen
somehow
to
wait
for
medical
knowledge
beyond
that
of
his
own
time
he
heard
it
might
be
possible
to
do
that
it
was
a
cockeyed
future
if
this
were
the
future
still
if
scientists
had
to
set
up
some
sort
of
a
religious
sickness
thickened
in
him
until
he
could
feel
his
face
wet
with
perspiration
but
with
it
had
come
a
paralysis
that
left
him
unable
to
move
or
groan
he
screamed
inside
himself
poor
the
girl
said
softly
go
back
to
lethe
but
cross
over
we
need
you
sorely
then
he
passed
out
again
ii
whatever
they
had
done
to
patch
him
up
had
been
very
successful
apparently
he
spent
most
of
the
time
in
a
delirium
sometimes
he
was
dead
and
there
was
an
ultimate
coldness
like
the
universe
long
after
the
entropy
death
at
other
times
he
was
wandering
into
fantasies
that
were
all
horrible
and
at
all
times
even
in
unconsciousness
he
seemed
to
be
fighting
desperately
to
keep
from
falling
apart
painfully
within
himself
when
he
was
awake
the
girl
was
always
beside
him
he
learned
that
her
name
was
nema
usually
there
was
also
the
stout
figure
of
ser
perth
sometimes
he
saw
sather
karf
or
some
other
older
man
working
with
strange
equipment
or
with
things
that
looked
like
familiar
hypodermics
and
medical
equipment
once
they
had
an
iron
lung
around
him
and
there
was
a
thin
wisp
over
his
face
he
started
to
brush
it
aside
but
nema
hand
restrained
him
disturb
the
sylph
she
ordered
another
semirational
period
occurred
during
some
excitement
or
danger
that
centered
around
him
he
was
still
half
delirious
but
he
could
see
men
working
frantically
to
build
a
net
of
something
around
his
bed
while
a
wet
thick
thing
flopped
and
drooled
beyond
the
door
apparently
immune
to
the
attacks
of
the
hospital
staff
there
were
shouting
orders
involving
the
undine
the
salamander
in
dave
chest
crept
deeper
and
seemed
to
bleat
at
each
cry
of
the
monstrous
thing
beyond
the
door
sather
karf
sat
hunched
over
what
seemed
to
be
a
bowl
of
water
paying
no
attention
to
the
struggle
something
that
he
seemed
to
see
there
held
his
attention
then
he
screamed
suddenly
the
sons
of
the
egg
it
their
sending
he
reached
for
a
brazier
beside
him
caught
up
the
fire
and
plunged
it
deep
into
the
bowl
of
water
screaming
something
there
was
the
sound
of
an
explosion
from
far
away
as
he
drew
his
hands
out
unwet
by
the
water
abruptly
the
undine
began
a
slow
retreat
in
dave
chest
the
salamander
began
purring
again
and
he
drifted
back
into
his
coma
he
tried
to
ask
nema
about
it
later
when
she
was
feeding
him
but
she
brushed
it
aside
an
orderly
let
out
the
news
that
you
are
here
she
said
but
worry
we
sent
out
a
doppelganger
to
fool
the
sons
and
the
orderly
has
been
sentenced
to
slavery
under
the
pyramid
builder
for
twenty
lifetimes
i
hate
my
brother
how
dare
he
fight
us
with
the
sky
falling
later
the
delirium
seemed
to
pass
completely
but
dave
took
no
comfort
from
that
in
its
place
came
a
feeling
of
gloom
and
apathy
he
slept
most
of
the
time
as
if
not
daring
to
use
his
little
strength
even
to
think
ser
perth
stayed
near
him
most
of
the
time
now
the
man
was
obviously
worried
but
tried
not
to
show
it
we
managed
to
get
some
testosterone
from
a
blond
homunculus
he
reported
that
should
put
you
on
your
feet
in
no
time
do
worry
young
man
we
keep
you
vivified
somehow
until
the
sign
changes
but
he
did
sound
convincing
everyone
is
chanting
for
you
nema
told
him
all
over
the
world
the
chants
go
up
it
meant
nothing
to
him
but
it
sounded
friendly
a
whole
world
hoping
for
him
to
get
well
he
cheered
up
a
bit
at
that
until
he
found
out
that
the
chants
were
compulsory
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
goodwill
the
iron
lung
was
back
the
next
time
he
came
to
and
he
was
being
tugged
toward
it
he
noticed
this
time
that
there
was
no
sylph
and
his
breathing
seemed
to
be
no
worse
than
usual
but
the
sight
of
the
two
orderlies
and
the
man
in
medical
uniform
beside
the
lung
reassured
him
whatever
their
methods
he
was
convinced
that
they
were
doing
their
best
for
him
here
he
tried
to
help
them
get
him
into
the
lung
and
one
of
the
men
nodded
encouragingly
but
dave
was
too
weak
to
give
much
assistance
he
glanced
about
for
nema
but
she
was
out
on
one
of
her
infrequent
other
duties
he
sighed
wishing
desperately
that
she
were
with
him
she
was
a
lot
more
proficient
than
the
orderlies
the
man
in
medical
robe
turned
toward
him
sharply
stop
that
he
ordered
before
dave
could
ask
what
he
was
to
stop
nema
came
rushing
into
the
room
her
face
paled
as
she
saw
the
three
men
and
she
gasped
throwing
up
her
hand
in
a
protective
gesture
the
two
orderlies
jumped
for
her
one
grabbing
her
and
the
other
closing
his
hands
over
her
mouth
she
struggled
violently
but
the
men
were
too
strong
for
her
the
man
in
doctor
robes
shoved
the
iron
lung
aside
violently
and
reached
into
his
clothing
from
it
he
drew
a
strange
knife
he
swung
toward
dave
raising
the
knife
into
striking
position
and
aiming
it
at
dave
heart
the
egg
breaks
he
intoned
hollowly
it
was
a
cultured
voice
and
there
was
a
refinement
to
his
face
that
registered
on
dave
mind
even
over
the
horror
of
the
weapon
the
fools
can
not
hold
the
shell
but
neither
shall
they
delay
its
breaking
dead
you
were
mandrake
son
and
dead
you
shall
be
again
but
since
the
fault
is
only
theirs
may
no
ill
dreams
follow
you
beyond
lethe
the
knife
started
down
just
as
nema
managed
to
break
free
she
shrieked
out
a
phrase
of
keening
command
the
salamander
suddenly
broke
from
dave
chest
glowing
brighter
as
it
rose
toward
the
face
of
the
attacker
it
was
like
a
bit
from
the
center
of
a
star
the
man
jumped
back
beginning
a
frantic
ritual
he
was
too
late
the
salamander
hit
him
sank
into
him
and
shone
through
him
then
he
slumped
steamed
and
was
nothing
but
dust
falling
toward
the
carpet
the
salamander
turned
heading
toward
the
others
but
it
was
to
nema
it
went
rather
than
the
two
men
she
was
trying
something
desperately
but
fear
was
thick
on
her
face
and
her
hands
were
unsure
abruptly
sather
karf
was
in
the
doorway
his
hand
lifted
his
fingers
dancing
words
hissed
from
his
lips
in
a
stream
of
sibilants
too
quick
for
dave
to
catch
the
salamander
paused
and
began
to
shrink
doubtfully
sather
karf
turned
and
again
his
hands
writhed
in
the
air
one
hand
darted
back
and
forward
as
if
he
were
throwing
something
again
he
made
the
gesture
with
each
throw
one
of
the
false
orderlies
dropped
to
the
floor
clutching
at
a
neck
where
the
skin
showed
marks
of
constriction
as
if
a
steel
cord
were
tightening
they
died
slowly
their
eyes
bulging
and
faces
turning
blue
now
the
salamander
moved
toward
them
directed
apparently
by
slight
motions
from
sather
karf
in
a
few
moments
there
was
no
sign
of
them
the
old
man
sighed
his
face
slumping
into
lines
of
fatigue
and
age
he
caught
his
breath
he
held
out
a
hand
to
the
salamander
petted
it
to
a
gentle
glow
and
put
it
back
over
dave
chest
good
work
nema
he
said
wearily
you
too
weak
to
control
the
salamander
but
this
was
done
well
in
the
emergency
i
saw
them
in
the
pool
but
i
was
almost
too
late
the
damned
fanatics
superstition
in
this
day
and
age
he
swung
to
face
dave
whose
vocal
cords
were
still
taut
with
the
shock
of
the
sight
of
the
knife
do
worry
dave
hanson
from
now
on
every
ser
and
sather
will
protect
you
with
the
lower
and
the
upper
magic
the
house
changes
tomorrow
if
the
sky
permits
and
we
shall
shield
you
until
then
we
did
bring
you
back
from
the
dead
piecing
your
scattered
atoms
together
with
your
scattered
revenant
particle
by
particle
to
have
you
killed
again
somehow
we
incarnate
you
fully
you
have
my
word
for
that
dead
dave
had
grown
numbed
to
his
past
during
the
long
illness
but
that
brought
it
back
afresh
then
i
was
killed
i
was
just
frozen
and
brought
here
by
some
time
machine
sather
karf
stared
at
him
blankly
time
machine
impossible
of
course
not
after
the
tractor
killed
you
and
you
were
buried
what
good
would
such
fantasies
be
even
if
they
existed
no
we
simply
reincarnated
you
by
pooling
our
magic
though
it
was
a
hazardous
and
parlous
thing
with
the
sky
falling
he
sighed
and
went
out
while
dave
went
back
to
his
delirium
iii
there
was
no
delirium
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
instead
there
was
only
a
feeling
of
buoyant
health
in
fact
dave
hanson
had
never
felt
that
good
in
his
life
or
his
former
life
he
reconsidered
his
belief
that
there
was
no
delirium
wondering
if
the
feeling
were
not
itself
a
form
of
hallucination
but
it
was
too
genuine
he
knew
without
question
that
he
was
well
it
should
have
been
true
during
the
night
he
partially
awakened
in
agony
to
find
nema
chanting
and
gesturing
desperately
beside
him
and
he
been
sure
he
was
on
the
verge
of
his
second
death
he
could
remember
one
moment
just
before
midnight
when
she
had
stopped
and
seemed
to
give
up
hope
then
she
braced
herself
and
begun
some
ritual
as
if
she
were
afraid
to
try
it
beyond
that
he
had
no
memory
of
pain
nema
came
into
the
room
now
touching
his
shoulder
gently
she
smiled
and
nodded
at
him
good
morning
sagittarian
get
out
of
bed
expecting
the
worst
he
swung
his
feet
over
the
side
and
sat
up
after
so
much
time
in
bed
even
a
well
man
should
be
rendered
weak
and
shaky
but
there
was
no
dizziness
no
sign
of
weakness
he
had
made
a
most
remarkable
recovery
and
nema
did
even
seem
surprised
he
tentatively
touched
foot
to
floor
and
half
stood
propping
himself
against
the
high
bed
come
on
nema
said
impatiently
you
all
right
now
we
entered
your
sign
during
the
night
she
turned
her
back
on
him
and
took
something
from
a
chest
beside
the
bed
ser
perth
will
be
here
in
a
moment
want
to
find
you
on
your
feet
and
dressed
hanson
was
beginning
to
feel
annoyance
at
the
suddenly
cocksure
and
unsympathetic
girl
but
he
stood
fully
erect
and
flexed
his
muscles
there
was
even
a
trace
of
bedsoreness
though
he
had
been
flat
on
his
back
long
enough
to
grow
callouses
and
as
he
examined
himself
he
could
find
no
scars
or
signs
of
injuries
from
the
impact
of
the
bulldozer
if
there
had
ever
really
been
a
bulldozer
he
grimaced
at
his
own
doubts
where
am
i
anyhow
nema
the
girl
dumped
an
armload
of
clothing
on
his
bed
and
looked
at
him
with
controlled
exasperation
dave
hanson
she
told
him
do
you
know
any
other
words
that
the
millionth
time
you
asked
me
that
at
least
and
for
the
hundredth
time
i
tell
you
that
you
here
look
around
you
see
for
yourself
i
tired
of
playing
nursemaid
to
you
she
picked
up
a
shirt
of
khaki
from
the
pile
on
the
bed
and
handed
it
to
him
get
into
this
she
ordered
dress
first
talk
later
she
stalked
out
of
the
room
dave
did
as
she
had
ordered
busy
with
his
own
thoughts
as
he
discovered
what
he
was
to
wear
he
was
still
wearing
something
with
a
vague
resemblance
to
a
short
hospital
gown
with
green
pentacles
and
some
plant
symbol
woven
into
it
and
with
a
clasp
to
hold
it
together
shaped
into
a
silver
crux
ansata
he
took
it
off
and
hurled
it
into
a
corner
disgustedly
he
picked
up
the
khaki
shirt
and
put
it
on
then
with
growing
curiosity
the
rest
of
the
garments
until
he
came
to
the
shoes
khaki
shirt
khaki
breeches
a
wide
webbed
belt
a
hat
and
the
shoes
they
were
shoes
but
leather
boots
like
a
dressy
version
of
lumberman
boots
or
a
rougher
version
of
riding
boots
he
had
seen
even
pictures
of
such
things
since
the
few
silent
movies
run
in
some
of
the
little
art
theaters
he
struggled
to
get
them
on
they
were
an
excellent
fit
and
comfortable
enough
but
he
felt
as
if
his
legs
were
encased
in
hardened
concrete
when
he
was
through
he
looked
down
at
himself
in
disgust
he
was
in
all
respects
costumed
as
the
epitome
of
the
hollywood
dream
of
a
heroic
ready
to
drive
a
canal
through
an
isthmus
or
throw
a
dam
across
a
raging
river
the
kind
who
build
the
dam
while
the
river
raged
instead
of
waiting
until
it
was
quiet
a
few
days
later
he
was
about
as
far
from
the
appearance
of
the
actual
engineers
he
had
worked
with
as
maori
in
ancient
battle
array
he
shook
his
head
and
went
looking
for
the
bathroom
where
there
might
be
a
mirror
he
found
a
door
but
it
led
into
a
closet
filled
with
alembics
and
other
equipment
there
was
a
mirror
hung
on
the
back
of
it
however
with
a
big
sign
over
it
that
said
keep
out
he
threw
the
door
wide
and
stared
at
himself
at
first
in
spite
of
the
costume
he
was
pleased
then
the
truth
began
to
hit
him
and
he
felt
abruptly
sure
he
was
still
raging
with
fever
and
delirium
he
was
still
staring
when
nema
came
back
into
the
room
she
pursed
her
lips
and
shut
the
door
quickly
but
he
already
seen
enough
never
mind
where
i
am
he
said
tell
me
am
i
she
stared
at
him
you
dave
hanson
the
hell
i
am
he
told
her
oh
that
what
i
remember
my
father
having
me
christened
as
he
hated
long
names
but
take
a
good
look
at
me
i
been
shaving
my
face
for
years
now
and
i
should
know
it
face
in
the
mirror
was
it
there
a
resemblance
but
a
darned
faint
one
change
the
chin
lengthen
my
nose
make
the
eyes
brown
instead
of
blue
and
it
might
be
me
but
dave
hanson
at
least
five
inches
shorter
and
fifty
pounds
lighter
too
maybe
the
face
is
plastic
surgery
after
the
accident
but
this
is
even
my
body
the
girl
expression
softened
i
sorry
dave
hanson
she
said
gently
we
should
have
thought
to
warn
you
you
were
a
difficult
conjuration
and
even
the
easier
ones
often
go
wrong
these
days
we
did
our
best
though
it
may
be
that
the
auspices
were
too
strong
on
the
soma
i
sorry
if
you
do
like
the
way
you
look
but
there
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
now
hanson
opened
the
door
again
in
spite
of
nema
quick
frown
and
looked
at
himself
well
he
admitted
i
guess
it
could
be
worse
in
fact
i
guess
it
was
worse
once
i
get
used
to
looking
like
this
i
think
get
to
like
it
but
seeing
it
was
a
heck
of
a
thing
to
take
for
a
sick
man
nema
said
sharply
are
you
sick
well
i
guess
not
then
why
say
you
are
you
should
be
i
told
you
we
entered
the
house
of
sagittarius
now
you
ca
be
sick
in
your
own
sign
do
you
understand
even
that
much
elementary
science
hanson
did
get
a
chance
to
answer
ser
perth
was
suddenly
in
the
doorway
dressed
in
a
different
type
of
robe
this
was
short
and
somehow
conservative
it
had
a
sincere
executive
look
about
it
the
man
seemed
changed
in
other
ways
too
but
dave
was
concerned
about
that
he
was
growing
tired
of
the
way
people
suddenly
appeared
out
of
nowhere
maybe
they
all
wore
shoes
or
practiced
sneaking
about
it
was
a
silly
way
for
grown
people
to
act
come
with
me
dave
hanson
ser
perth
ordered
without
wasting
words
he
spoke
in
a
clipped
manner
now
dave
followed
grumbling
in
his
mind
it
was
even
sillier
than
their
sneaking
about
for
them
to
expect
him
to
start
running
around
before
they
bothered
to
check
the
condition
of
a
man
fresh
out
of
his
death
bed
in
any
of
the
hospitals
he
had
known
there
would
have
been
hours
or
days
of
and
blood
tests
and
temperature
taking
before
he
would
be
released
these
people
simply
decided
a
man
was
well
and
ordered
him
out
to
do
them
justice
however
he
had
to
admit
that
they
seemed
to
be
right
he
had
never
felt
better
the
twaddle
about
sagittarius
would
have
to
be
cleared
up
sometime
but
meanwhile
he
was
in
pretty
good
shape
sagittarius
as
he
remembered
it
was
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
bertha
had
been
something
of
a
sucker
for
astrology
and
had
found
he
was
born
under
that
sign
before
she
agreed
to
their
little
party
he
snorted
to
himself
it
had
done
her
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
good
which
was
to
be
expected
of
such
nonsense
they
passed
down
a
dim
corridor
and
ser
perth
turned
in
at
a
door
inside
there
was
a
barber
shop
with
a
barber
who
might
also
have
come
from
some
office
he
had
the
proper
wavy
black
hair
and
comb
stuck
into
a
slightly
dirty
jacket
he
also
had
the
manner
dave
had
found
most
people
expected
from
their
barbers
while
he
shaved
and
trimmed
dave
he
made
insultingly
solicitous
comments
about
dave
skin
needing
a
massage
suggested
a
tonic
for
thinning
hair
and
practically
insisted
on
a
singe
ser
perth
watched
with
a
mixture
of
intentness
and
amusement
the
barber
trimmed
the
tufts
from
over
dave
ears
and
clipped
the
hair
in
his
nose
while
a
tray
was
pushed
up
and
a
slatternly
blonde
began
giving
him
a
manicure
he
began
noticing
that
she
carefully
dumped
his
fingernail
parings
into
a
small
jar
a
few
moments
later
he
found
the
barber
also
using
a
jar
to
collect
the
hair
and
shaving
stubble
ser
perth
was
also
interested
in
that
it
seemed
since
his
eyes
followed
that
part
of
the
operation
dave
frowned
and
then
relaxed
after
all
this
was
a
hospital
barber
shop
and
they
probably
had
some
rigid
rules
about
sanitation
though
he
had
seen
much
other
evidence
of
such
care
the
barber
finally
removed
the
cloth
with
a
snap
and
bowed
come
again
sir
he
said
ser
perth
stood
up
and
motioned
for
dave
to
follow
he
turned
to
look
in
a
mirror
and
caught
sight
of
the
barber
handing
the
bottles
and
jars
of
waste
hair
and
nail
clippings
to
a
girl
he
saw
only
her
back
but
it
looked
like
nema
something
stirred
in
his
mind
then
he
read
something
somewhere
about
hair
clippings
and
nail
parings
being
used
for
some
strange
purpose
and
there
been
something
about
spittle
but
they
had
collected
that
or
had
they
he
been
unconscious
long
enough
for
them
to
have
gathered
any
amount
they
wanted
it
all
had
something
to
do
with
some
kind
of
and
ser
perth
had
led
him
through
the
same
door
by
which
they
entered
but
into
the
same
hallway
dave
mind
dropped
the
other
thoughts
as
he
tried
to
cope
with
the
realization
that
this
was
another
corridor
it
was
brightly
lit
and
there
was
a
scarlet
carpet
on
the
floor
also
it
was
a
short
hall
requiring
only
a
few
steps
before
they
came
to
a
bigger
door
elaborately
enscrolled
ser
perth
bent
before
it
and
the
door
opened
silently
while
he
and
dave
entered
the
room
was
large
and
sparsely
furnished
sitting
on
a
cushion
near
the
door
was
nema
juggling
something
in
her
hands
it
looked
like
a
cluster
of
colored
threads
partly
woven
into
a
rather
garish
pattern
on
a
raised
bench
between
two
windows
sat
the
old
figure
of
sather
karf
resting
his
chin
on
hands
that
held
a
staff
and
staring
at
dave
intently
dave
stopped
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
sather
karf
nodded
as
if
satisfied
and
nema
tied
a
complex
knot
in
the
threads
then
paused
silently
sather
karf
looked
far
less
well
than
when
dave
had
last
seen
him
he
seemed
older
and
more
shriveled
and
there
was
a
querulous
pinched
expression
in
place
of
the
firmness
and
almost
nobility
dave
had
come
to
expect
his
old
eyes
bored
into
the
younger
man
and
he
nodded
his
voice
had
a
faint
quaver
now
all
right
you
not
much
to
look
at
but
you
the
best
we
could
find
in
the
ways
we
can
reach
come
here
dave
hanson
the
command
was
still
there
however
petty
the
man
seemed
now
dave
started
to
phrase
some
protest
when
he
found
his
legs
taking
him
forward
to
stop
in
front
of
sather
karf
like
some
clockwork
man
whose
lever
has
been
pushed
he
stood
in
front
of
the
raised
bench
noticing
that
the
spot
had
been
chosen
to
highlight
him
in
the
sunset
light
from
the
windows
he
listened
while
the
old
man
talked
sather
karf
began
without
preamble
stating
things
in
a
dry
voice
as
if
reading
off
a
list
of
obvious
facts
you
were
dead
dave
hanson
dead
buried
and
scattered
by
time
and
chance
until
even
the
place
where
you
lay
was
forgotten
in
your
own
world
you
were
nothing
now
you
are
alive
through
the
effort
of
men
here
whose
work
you
could
not
even
dream
of
we
have
created
you
dave
hanson
remember
that
and
forget
the
ties
to
any
other
world
since
that
world
no
longer
holds
you
dave
nodded
slowly
it
was
hard
to
swallow
but
there
were
too
many
things
here
that
could
be
in
any
world
he
had
known
and
his
memory
of
dying
was
the
clearest
memory
he
had
all
right
he
admitted
you
saved
my
life
or
something
and
i
try
to
remember
it
but
if
this
is
my
world
what
world
is
it
the
only
world
perhaps
it
does
matter
the
old
man
sighed
and
for
a
moment
the
eyes
were
shrouded
in
speculation
as
if
he
were
following
some
strange
of
his
own
thoughts
then
he
shrugged
it
a
world
and
culture
linked
to
the
one
you
knew
only
by
theories
that
disagree
with
each
other
and
by
vision
the
vision
of
those
who
are
adept
enough
to
see
through
the
ways
to
the
branches
of
duality
before
me
there
was
nothing
but
i
learned
to
open
a
path
a
difficult
path
for
one
in
this
world
and
to
draw
from
it
as
you
have
been
drawn
do
try
to
understand
what
is
a
mystery
even
to
the
satheri
dave
hanson
a
reasonably
intelligent
man
should
be
able
dave
began
ser
perth
cut
his
words
off
with
a
sharp
laugh
maybe
a
man
but
who
said
you
were
a
man
dave
hanson
ca
you
even
understand
that
only
half
human
the
other
half
is
mandrake
a
plant
that
is
related
to
humanity
through
shapes
and
signs
by
magic
we
make
simulacra
out
of
mandrakes
like
the
manicurist
in
the
barber
shop
and
sometimes
we
use
a
mandrake
root
to
capture
the
essence
of
a
real
man
in
which
case
a
like
you
human
no
but
a
very
good
imitation
i
must
admit
dave
turned
from
ser
perth
toward
nema
but
her
head
was
bent
over
the
cords
she
was
weaving
and
she
avoided
his
eyes
he
remembered
now
that
she
called
him
a
before
in
a
tone
of
pity
he
looked
down
at
his
body
sick
in
his
mind
vague
bits
of
fairy
tales
came
back
to
him
suggesting
horrible
things
about
mandrake
creatures
things
only
outwardly
human
sather
karf
seemed
amused
as
he
looked
at
ser
perth
then
the
old
man
dropped
his
eyes
toward
dave
and
there
was
a
brief
look
of
pity
in
them
no
matter
dave
hanson
he
said
you
were
human
and
by
the
power
of
your
true
name
you
are
still
the
same
dave
hanson
we
have
given
you
life
as
precious
as
your
other
life
pay
us
for
that
with
your
service
and
that
new
life
will
be
truly
precious
we
need
your
services
what
do
you
want
dave
asked
he
could
fully
believe
what
heard
but
there
had
been
too
many
strange
things
to
let
him
disbelieve
either
if
they
had
made
him
a
then
by
what
little
he
could
remember
and
guess
they
could
make
him
obey
them
look
out
the
window
at
the
sky
sather
karf
ordered
dave
looked
the
sunset
colors
were
still
vivid
he
stepped
forward
and
peered
through
the
crystalline
glass
before
him
was
a
city
bathed
in
orange
and
red
towering
like
the
skyline
of
a
dozen
cities
he
had
seen
and
yet
not
like
any
the
buildings
were
huge
and
but
some
were
straight
and
tall
some
were
squat
and
and
others
blossomed
from
thin
stalks
into
impossibly
bulbous
minareted
domes
like
tulips
reproduced
in
stone
might
have
accepted
the
city
but
mayor
wagner
could
never
have
believed
in
it
look
at
the
sky
the
old
man
suggested
again
and
there
was
no
mockery
in
his
voice
now
dave
looked
up
obediently
the
sunset
colors
were
not
sunset
the
sun
was
bright
and
blinding
overhead
surrounded
by
reddish
clouds
glaring
down
on
the
fairy
city
the
sky
was
blotchy
it
was
daylight
but
through
the
clouds
bright
stars
were
shining
a
corner
of
the
horizon
was
winter
blue
a
whole
sweep
of
it
was
dead
featureless
black
it
was
a
nightmare
sky
an
impossible
sky
dave
eyes
bulged
as
he
looked
at
it
he
turned
back
to
sather
karf
what
what
the
matter
with
it
what
indeed
there
was
bitterness
and
fear
in
the
old
man
voice
in
the
corner
of
the
room
nema
looked
up
for
a
moment
and
there
was
fear
and
worry
in
her
eyes
before
she
looked
back
to
her
weaving
of
endless
knots
sather
karf
sighed
in
weariness
if
i
knew
what
was
happening
to
the
sky
would
i
be
dredging
the
muck
of
duality
for
the
likes
of
you
dave
hanson
he
stood
up
wearily
but
with
a
certain
ease
and
grace
that
belied
his
age
looking
down
at
dave
there
was
stern
command
in
his
words
but
a
hint
of
pleading
in
his
expression
the
sky
falling
dave
hanson
your
task
is
to
put
it
together
again
see
that
you
do
not
fail
us
he
waved
dismissal
and
ser
perth
led
dave
and
nema
out
iv
the
corridor
down
which
they
moved
this
time
was
one
that
might
have
been
familiar
even
in
dave
chicago
there
was
the
sound
of
typewriters
from
behind
the
doors
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
composition
tile
instead
of
the
carpets
he
began
to
relax
a
little
until
he
came
to
two
attendants
busily
waxing
the
floor
one
held
the
other
by
the
ankles
and
pushed
the
creature
hairy
face
back
and
forth
while
its
hands
spread
the
wax
ahead
of
it
the
results
were
excellent
but
dave
found
it
hard
to
appreciate
ser
perth
shrugged
slightly
they
only
mandrakes
he
explained
he
threw
open
the
door
of
one
of
the
offices
and
led
them
through
an
outer
room
toward
an
inner
chamber
equipped
with
comfortable
chairs
and
a
desk
sit
down
dave
hanson
i
fill
you
in
on
anything
you
need
to
know
before
you
assigned
now
the
sather
karf
told
you
what
you
were
to
do
of
course
but
wait
a
minute
dave
suggested
i
do
remember
being
told
any
such
thing
ser
perth
looked
at
nema
who
nodded
he
distinctly
said
you
were
to
repair
the
sky
i
got
it
down
in
my
notes
if
you
want
to
see
them
she
extended
the
woven
cords
never
mind
ser
perth
said
he
twiddled
with
his
mustache
i
recap
a
little
dave
hanson
as
you
have
seen
the
sky
is
falling
and
must
be
repaired
you
are
our
best
hope
we
know
that
from
a
prophecy
and
it
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
fanatics
of
the
egg
have
tried
several
times
to
kill
you
they
failed
though
one
effort
was
close
enough
but
their
attempts
would
not
have
been
made
at
all
if
they
had
not
been
convinced
through
their
arts
that
you
can
succeed
with
the
sky
dave
shook
his
head
it
nice
to
know
you
trust
me
knowing
that
you
succeed
the
other
went
on
smoothly
we
know
that
you
will
it
is
my
unpleasant
duty
to
point
out
to
you
the
things
that
will
happen
if
you
fail
i
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
you
owe
us
your
life
that
may
be
a
small
enough
gift
and
one
quickly
withdrawn
i
say
only
that
you
have
no
escape
from
us
we
have
your
name
and
the
true
symbol
is
the
thing
as
you
should
know
we
also
have
cuttings
from
your
hair
and
your
beard
we
have
the
parings
of
your
nails
five
cubic
centimeters
of
your
spinal
fluid
and
a
scraping
from
your
liver
we
have
your
body
through
those
nor
can
you
take
it
out
of
our
reach
your
name
gives
us
your
soul
he
looked
at
hanson
piercingly
shall
i
tell
you
what
it
would
be
like
for
your
soul
to
live
in
the
muck
of
a
swamp
in
a
mandrake
root
dave
shook
his
head
i
guess
not
i
look
ser
perth
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
how
can
i
go
along
with
you
when
i
in
the
dark
start
at
the
beginning
will
you
i
was
killed
all
right
if
you
say
i
was
i
was
you
brought
me
to
life
again
with
a
mandrake
root
and
spells
you
can
do
anything
you
want
with
me
i
admit
it
right
now
i
admit
anything
you
want
me
to
because
you
know
what
going
on
and
i
do
but
what
all
this
business
of
the
sky
falling
if
it
is
and
can
be
falling
what
the
difference
if
there
is
a
difference
why
should
i
be
able
to
do
anything
about
it
ignorance
ser
perth
murmured
to
himself
he
sighed
heavily
always
ignorance
well
then
listen
he
sat
down
on
the
corner
of
the
desk
and
took
out
a
cigarette
at
least
it
looked
like
a
cigarette
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
lighted
it
from
a
little
flame
that
sprang
up
blowing
clouds
of
bright
green
smoke
from
his
mouth
the
smoke
hung
lazily
drifting
into
vague
patterns
and
then
began
to
coalesce
into
a
green
houri
without
costume
he
swatted
at
it
negligently
dratted
sylphs
there
no
controlling
the
elementals
properly
any
more
he
did
seem
too
displeased
however
as
he
watched
the
thing
dance
off
then
he
sobered
in
your
world
dave
hanson
you
were
versed
in
the
engineering
arts
you
more
than
most
that
you
should
be
so
ignorant
though
you
were
considered
brilliant
is
a
sad
commentary
on
your
world
but
no
matter
perhaps
you
can
at
least
learn
quickly
still
even
you
must
have
had
some
idea
of
the
composition
of
the
sky
dave
frowned
as
he
tried
to
answer
well
i
suppose
the
atmosphere
is
oxygen
and
nitrogen
mostly
then
there
the
ionosphere
and
the
ozone
layer
as
i
remember
the
color
of
the
sky
is
due
to
the
scattering
of
light
light
rays
being
diffracted
in
the
air
beyond
the
air
ser
perth
said
impatiently
the
sky
itself
oh
space
we
were
just
getting
out
there
with
manned
ships
mostly
vacuum
of
course
of
course
we
still
in
the
solar
atmosphere
even
there
with
the
van
allen
belts
and
such
things
then
there
are
the
stars
like
our
sun
but
much
more
distant
the
planets
and
the
moon
ignorance
was
bad
enough
ser
perth
interrupted
in
amazement
he
stared
at
dave
shaking
his
head
in
disgust
you
obviously
come
from
a
culture
of
even
more
superstition
than
ignorance
dave
hanson
the
sky
is
no
such
thing
put
aside
the
myths
you
heard
as
a
child
the
sky
is
a
solid
sphere
that
surrounds
earth
the
stars
are
no
more
like
the
sun
than
the
glow
of
my
cigarette
is
like
a
forest
fire
they
are
lights
on
the
inside
of
the
sphere
moving
in
patterns
of
the
star
art
nearer
to
us
than
the
hot
lands
to
the
south
fort
dave
said
charles
fort
said
that
in
a
book
ser
perth
shrugged
then
why
make
me
say
it
again
this
fort
was
right
at
least
one
intelligent
man
lived
in
your
world
i
pleased
to
know
the
sky
is
a
dome
holding
the
sun
the
stars
and
the
wandering
planets
the
problem
is
that
the
dome
is
cracking
like
a
great
smashed
eggshell
what
beyond
the
dome
ser
perth
shuddered
slightly
my
greatest
wish
is
that
i
die
before
i
learn
in
your
world
had
you
discovered
that
there
were
such
things
as
elements
that
is
basic
substances
which
in
combination
produce
of
course
dave
interrupted
good
then
of
the
four
elements
dave
gulped
but
kept
silent
of
the
four
elements
the
universe
is
built
some
things
are
composed
of
a
single
element
some
of
two
some
of
three
the
proportions
vary
and
the
humors
and
spirits
change
but
all
things
are
composed
of
the
elements
and
only
the
sky
is
composed
of
all
four
elements
of
earth
of
water
of
fire
and
of
air
in
equal
proportions
one
part
each
lending
each
its
own
essential
quality
to
the
mixture
so
that
the
sky
is
solid
as
earth
radiant
as
fire
formless
as
water
insubstantial
as
air
and
the
sky
is
cracking
and
falling
as
you
have
seen
for
yourself
the
effects
are
already
being
felt
gamma
radiation
is
flooding
through
the
gaps
the
viruses
are
mutating
through
half
the
world
faster
than
the
medical
art
can
control
them
so
that
millions
of
us
are
sneezing
and
choking
and
dying
too
for
lack
of
antibiotics
and
proper
care
air
travel
is
a
perilous
thing
just
today
a
stratosphere
roc
crashed
into
a
fragment
of
the
sky
and
was
killed
with
all
its
passengers
worst
of
all
the
science
of
magic
suffers
because
the
stars
are
fixed
on
the
dome
of
the
sky
with
the
crumbling
of
that
dome
the
course
of
the
stars
has
been
corrupted
it
pitiful
magic
that
can
be
worked
without
regard
to
the
conjunctions
of
the
planets
but
it
is
all
the
magic
that
is
left
to
us
when
mars
trines
neptune
the
medical
art
is
weak
even
while
we
were
conjuring
you
the
trine
occurred
it
almost
cost
your
life
and
it
should
not
have
occurred
for
another
seven
days
there
was
silence
while
ser
perth
let
dave
consider
it
but
it
was
too
much
to
accept
at
once
and
dave
mind
was
a
treadmill
he
agreed
to
admit
anything
but
some
of
this
was
such
complete
nonsense
that
his
mind
rejected
it
automatically
yet
he
was
sure
ser
perth
was
serious
there
was
no
humor
on
the
face
of
the
prissy
man
before
him
nor
had
the
sather
karf
considered
it
a
joke
he
was
sure
he
had
a
sudden
vision
of
the
latter
strangling
two
men
from
a
distance
of
thirty
feet
without
touching
them
that
could
happen
in
a
sane
world
either
dave
asked
weakly
could
i
have
a
drink
with
a
sylph
around
ser
perth
grimaced
you
would
have
a
chance
now
is
all
clear
to
you
dave
hanson
sure
except
for
one
thing
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
repair
our
sky
it
should
not
be
too
difficult
for
a
man
of
your
reputation
you
built
a
wall
across
a
continent
high
and
strong
enough
to
change
the
air
currents
and
affect
all
your
weather
and
that
in
the
coldest
meanest
country
in
your
world
you
come
down
to
us
as
one
of
the
greatest
engineers
of
history
dave
hanson
so
great
that
your
fame
has
penetrated
even
to
our
world
through
the
viewing
pools
of
our
wisest
historians
there
is
a
shrine
and
monument
in
your
world
hanson
to
whom
nothing
was
impossible
well
we
have
a
nearly
impossible
task
a
task
of
engineering
and
building
if
our
science
of
magic
could
be
relied
upon
but
it
can
not
it
never
can
be
until
the
sky
is
fixed
we
have
the
word
of
history
no
task
is
impossible
to
dave
hanson
dave
looked
at
the
smug
face
and
a
slow
grin
crept
over
his
own
in
spite
of
himself
ser
perth
i
afraid
you
made
a
slight
mistake
we
do
make
mistakes
in
such
matters
you
dave
hanson
ser
perth
said
flatly
of
all
the
powers
of
the
science
the
greatest
lies
in
the
true
name
we
evoked
you
by
the
name
of
dave
hanson
you
dave
hanson
therefore
do
try
to
deceive
us
nema
suggested
her
voice
was
troubled
pray
rather
that
we
never
have
reason
to
doubt
you
otherwise
the
wisest
of
the
satheri
would
spend
their
remaining
time
in
planning
something
unthinkable
for
you
ser
perth
nodded
vigorous
assent
then
he
motioned
to
the
office
nema
will
show
you
to
your
quarters
later
use
this
until
you
leave
i
have
to
report
back
dave
stared
after
him
until
he
was
gone
and
then
around
at
the
office
he
went
to
the
window
and
stared
upwards
at
the
crazy
patchwork
of
the
sky
for
all
he
knew
in
such
a
sky
there
might
be
cracks
in
fact
as
he
looked
he
could
make
out
a
rift
and
beyond
that
a
hole
a
small
patch
where
there
was
no
color
and
yet
the
sky
there
was
not
black
there
were
no
stars
there
though
points
of
light
were
clustered
around
the
edges
apparently
retreating
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
repair
the
sky
shades
of
chicken
little
maybe
to
david
arnold
hanson
the
famed
engineer
no
task
was
impossible
but
quite
a
few
things
were
impossible
to
that
obscure
and
unimportant
nephew
the
computer
technician
and
generally
undistinguished
man
who
had
been
christened
dave
they
gotten
the
right
man
for
the
name
all
right
but
the
wrong
man
for
the
job
dave
hanson
could
repair
anything
that
contained
electrical
circuits
or
ran
on
tiny
jeweled
bearings
but
he
could
handle
almost
nothing
else
it
was
stupidity
or
incapacity
to
learn
but
simply
that
he
had
never
been
subjected
to
the
discipline
of
construction
engineering
even
on
the
project
while
working
with
his
uncle
he
had
seen
little
of
what
went
on
and
had
really
understood
that
except
when
it
produced
data
that
he
could
feed
into
his
computer
he
could
drive
a
nail
in
the
wall
to
hang
a
picture
or
patch
a
hole
in
the
plaster
but
it
seemed
that
he
better
put
on
a
good
show
of
trying
if
he
wanted
to
continue
enjoying
good
health
i
suppose
you
got
a
sample
of
the
sky
that
fallen
he
asked
nema
and
what
the
heck
are
you
doing
here
anyhow
i
thought
you
were
a
nurse
she
frowned
at
him
but
went
to
a
corner
where
a
small
ball
of
some
clear
crystalline
substance
stood
she
muttered
into
it
while
a
surly
face
stared
out
then
she
turned
back
to
him
nodding
they
are
sending
some
of
the
sky
to
you
as
to
my
being
a
nurse
of
course
i
am
all
student
magicians
take
up
the
medical
art
for
a
time
surely
one
so
skilled
can
also
be
a
secretary
even
to
the
great
dave
hanson
as
to
why
i
here
she
dropped
her
eyes
frowning
while
a
touch
of
added
color
reached
her
cheeks
in
the
sleep
spell
i
used
i
invoked
that
you
should
be
well
and
true
but
i
only
a
bachelor
in
magic
not
even
a
master
and
i
slipped
i
phrased
it
that
i
wanted
you
well
and
true
hence
well
and
truly
do
i
want
you
huh
he
stared
at
her
watching
the
blush
deepen
you
mean
take
care
first
you
should
know
that
i
am
proscribed
as
a
duly
registered
virgin
and
in
this
time
of
need
the
magic
of
my
blood
must
not
be
profaned
she
twisted
sidewise
and
then
turned
toward
the
door
avoiding
him
before
she
reached
it
the
door
opened
to
show
a
dull
clod
entirely
naked
holding
up
a
heavy
weight
of
nothing
your
sample
of
sky
she
said
as
the
clod
labored
over
to
the
desk
and
dropped
nothing
with
a
dull
clank
the
desk
top
dented
slightly
dave
could
clearly
see
that
nothing
was
on
the
desk
but
if
nothing
was
a
vacuum
this
was
an
extremely
hard
and
heavy
one
it
seemed
to
be
about
twelve
inches
on
a
side
in
its
rough
shape
and
must
have
weighed
two
hundred
pounds
he
tapped
it
and
it
rang
inside
it
a
tiny
point
of
light
danced
frantically
back
and
forth
a
star
she
said
sadly
i
going
to
need
some
place
to
experiment
with
this
he
suggested
he
expected
to
be
sent
to
the
deepest
dankest
cave
of
all
the
world
as
a
laboratory
and
to
find
it
equipped
with
pedigreed
bats
dried
unicorn
horns
and
whole
rows
of
alembics
that
he
could
use
nema
smiled
brightly
of
course
we
already
prepared
a
construction
camp
for
you
you
find
most
of
the
tools
you
used
in
your
world
waiting
there
and
all
the
engineers
we
could
get
or
make
for
you
he
been
considering
stalling
while
he
demanded
exactly
such
things
he
was
reasonably
sure
by
now
that
they
had
no
transistors
signal
generators
frequency
meters
or
whatever
else
he
could
demand
he
could
make
quite
an
issue
out
of
the
need
to
determine
the
characteristic
impedance
of
their
sky
that
might
even
be
interesting
at
that
would
it
be
anywhere
near
ohms
here
but
it
seemed
that
stalling
going
to
work
they
given
him
what
they
expected
him
to
need
and
have
to
be
careful
to
need
only
what
they
expected
or
they
might
just
decide
he
was
dave
hanson
i
ca
work
on
this
stuff
here
he
said
then
why
did
you
say
so
she
asked
sharply
she
let
out
a
cry
and
a
raven
came
flying
in
she
whispered
something
to
it
frowned
and
then
ordered
it
off
there
no
surface
transportation
available
and
all
the
local
rocs
are
in
use
well
we
have
to
make
do
with
what
we
have
she
darted
for
the
outer
office
rummaged
in
a
cabinet
and
came
back
with
a
rug
of
worn
but
gaudy
design
bad
imitation
sarouk
dave
guessed
she
tossed
it
onto
the
largest
cleared
space
gobbled
some
outlandish
noises
and
dropped
onto
it
squatting
near
one
end
behind
her
the
dull
clod
picked
up
the
sample
of
sky
and
fell
to
his
face
on
the
rug
at
her
vehement
signal
dave
squatted
down
beside
her
not
daring
to
believe
what
he
was
beginning
to
guess
the
carpet
lifted
uncertainly
it
seemed
to
protest
at
the
unbalanced
weight
of
the
sky
piece
she
made
the
sounds
again
and
it
rose
reluctantly
curling
up
at
the
front
like
a
crazy
toboggan
it
moved
slowly
but
with
increasing
speed
sailed
out
of
the
office
through
the
window
and
began
gaining
altitude
they
went
soaring
over
the
city
at
about
thirty
miles
an
hour
heading
toward
what
seemed
to
be
barren
land
beyond
sometimes
they
fail
now
she
told
him
but
so
far
only
if
the
words
are
improperly
pronounced
he
gulped
and
looked
gingerly
over
at
the
city
below
as
he
did
she
gasped
he
heard
a
great
tearing
sound
of
thunder
in
the
sky
a
small
hole
appeared
there
was
a
scream
of
displaced
air
and
something
went
zipping
downwards
in
front
of
them
setting
up
a
wind
that
bounced
the
carpet
about
crazily
dave
glanced
over
the
edge
again
to
see
one
of
the
tall
buildings
crumple
under
the
impact
the
three
top
stories
were
ripped
to
shreds
then
the
whole
building
began
to
change
it
slowly
blossomed
into
a
huge
cloud
of
pink
gas
that
rifted
away
to
show
people
and
objects
dropping
like
stones
to
the
ground
below
nema
sighed
and
turned
her
eyes
away
but
it
ridiculous
dave
protested
we
heard
the
rip
and
less
than
five
seconds
later
that
piece
fell
if
your
sky
is
even
twenty
miles
above
us
it
would
take
longer
than
that
to
fall
it
a
thousand
miles
up
she
told
him
and
sky
has
no
inertia
until
it
is
contaminated
by
contact
with
the
ground
it
took
longer
than
usual
for
that
piece
to
fall
she
sighed
it
gets
worse
look
at
the
signs
that
break
has
disturbed
the
planets
we
moving
retrograde
back
to
our
previous
position
out
of
sagittarius
now
we
go
back
to
the
character
we
had
before
and
just
when
i
was
getting
used
to
the
change
he
jerked
his
eyes
off
the
raw
patch
of
emptiness
in
the
sky
where
a
few
stars
seemed
to
be
vanishing
your
character
is
anything
stable
here
of
course
not
naturally
in
each
house
we
have
a
differing
of
character
as
does
the
world
itself
why
else
should
astrology
be
the
greatest
of
the
sciences
it
was
a
nice
world
he
decided
and
yet
the
new
factor
explained
some
things
he
been
vaguely
worried
about
the
apparent
change
in
ser
perth
who
turned
from
a
serious
and
helpful
doctor
into
a
supercilious
fop
but
what
about
his
recovery
if
that
was
supposed
to
be
determined
by
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
he
had
no
time
to
ask
the
carpet
bucked
and
the
girl
began
speaking
to
it
urgently
it
wavered
then
righted
itself
to
begin
sliding
downwards
there
is
a
ring
of
protection
around
your
camp
nema
explained
it
is
set
to
make
entry
impossible
to
one
who
does
not
have
the
words
or
who
is
unfriendly
the
carpet
could
not
go
through
that
anyway
the
ring
negates
all
other
magic
trying
to
pass
it
and
of
course
we
have
basilisks
mounted
on
posts
around
the
grounds
they
trained
to
hood
their
eyes
except
when
they
sense
anyone
trying
to
enter
who
should
not
you
ca
be
turned
to
stone
looking
at
one
you
know
only
by
having
one
look
at
you
you
cheering
me
up
no
end
he
assured
her
she
smiled
pleasantly
and
began
setting
the
carpet
down
below
he
could
see
a
camp
that
looked
much
like
the
camps
he
had
seen
in
the
same
movies
from
which
all
his
clothes
had
been
copied
there
were
well
rows
of
sheds
beautiful
lines
of
construction
equipment
and
everything
in
order
as
it
could
never
be
in
a
real
camp
as
he
began
walking
with
the
girl
toward
a
huge
tent
that
should
have
belonged
to
a
circus
he
could
see
other
discrepancies
the
tractors
were
designed
for
work
in
mud
flats
and
the
haulers
had
the
narrow
wheels
used
on
rocky
ground
nothing
seemed
quite
as
it
should
be
he
spotted
a
big
generator
working
busily
and
then
saw
a
gang
of
about
fifty
men
or
mandrakes
turning
a
big
capstan
that
kept
it
going
here
and
there
were
neat
racks
of
miscellaneous
tools
some
were
museum
pieces
there
was
even
a
gandy
cart
though
no
rails
for
it
to
run
on
they
were
almost
at
the
main
tent
when
a
crow
flew
down
and
yelled
something
in
nema
ear
she
scowled
and
nodded
i
needed
back
she
said
most
of
the
men
here
she
pointed
to
the
gangs
that
moved
about
busily
doing
nothing
all
in
costumes
similar
to
his
except
for
the
boots
and
hat
they
mandrakes
conjured
into
existence
but
without
souls
the
engineers
we
have
are
snatched
from
duality
just
after
dying
and
revived
here
while
their
brains
still
retain
their
knowledge
they
have
no
true
souls
either
of
course
but
they
do
know
it
ah
the
short
man
there
he
garm
sersa
garm
an
apprentice
to
ser
perth
to
be
your
foreman
and
he
real
she
headed
back
to
the
outskirts
then
turned
to
shout
back
sather
karf
says
you
may
have
ten
days
to
fix
the
sky
she
called
her
hand
waved
toward
him
in
friendly
do
worry
dave
hanson
i
have
faith
in
you
then
she
was
running
toward
her
reluctant
carpet
dave
stared
up
at
the
mottled
dome
above
him
and
at
the
dull
clod
certainly
a
mandrake
who
was
still
carrying
the
sample
with
all
this
preparation
and
a
time
limit
he
could
even
afford
to
stall
he
never
fully
understood
why
some
plastics
melted
and
others
turned
hard
when
heated
but
he
had
to
find
what
was
wrong
with
the
dome
above
and
how
to
fix
it
and
maybe
the
time
limit
could
be
stretched
a
little
once
he
came
up
with
the
answer
maybe
he
worry
about
that
after
he
worried
about
the
first
steps
sersa
garm
proved
to
be
a
glum
fat
young
man
overly
aware
of
his
importance
in
training
for
serhood
he
led
dave
through
the
big
tent
taking
pride
in
the
large
drafting
section
under
the
obvious
belief
that
it
was
used
for
designing
spells
maybe
it
could
have
been
useful
for
that
if
there
had
been
a
single
man
who
knew
anything
about
draftsmanship
there
were
four
engineers
supposedly
one
who
had
died
falling
off
a
bridge
while
drunk
was
curing
himself
of
the
shock
by
remaining
dead
drunk
one
had
been
a
chemical
engineer
specializing
in
making
yeast
and
dried
soya
meal
into
breakfast
cereals
another
knew
all
about
dredging
canals
and
the
last
one
was
an
electronics
engineer
a
field
in
which
dave
was
far
more
competent
he
dismissed
them
whatever
had
been
done
to
them
or
perhaps
the
absence
of
a
true
soul
whatever
that
was
left
them
rigidly
bound
to
their
past
ideas
and
totally
incapable
of
doing
more
than
following
orders
by
routine
now
even
sersa
garm
was
more
useful
that
young
man
could
offer
little
information
however
the
sky
he
explained
pompously
was
a
great
mystery
that
only
an
adept
might
communicate
to
another
he
meant
that
he
did
know
about
it
dave
gathered
everything
it
turned
out
was
either
a
mystery
or
a
rumor
he
also
had
a
habit
of
sucking
his
thumb
when
pressed
too
hard
for
details
but
you
must
have
heard
some
guesses
about
what
started
the
cracks
in
the
sky
dave
suggested
oh
indeed
that
is
common
knowledge
sersa
garm
admitted
he
changed
thumbs
while
he
considered
was
an
experiment
most
noble
but
through
mischance
going
sadly
awry
a
great
sather
made
the
sun
remain
in
one
place
too
long
and
the
heat
became
too
great
it
was
like
the
classic
experiment
how
hot
is
your
sun
there
was
a
long
pause
then
sather
germ
shrugged
is
a
great
mystery
suffice
to
say
it
has
no
true
heat
but
does
send
forth
an
activating
principle
against
the
phlogiston
layer
which
being
excited
grows
vengeful
against
the
air
but
you
have
not
the
training
to
understand
okay
so
they
did
tell
you
if
they
knew
dave
stared
up
at
the
sun
trying
to
guess
the
light
looked
about
like
what
he
was
used
to
where
the
sky
was
still
whole
north
light
still
was
like
what
a
color
photographer
would
consider
kelvin
so
the
sun
must
be
pretty
hot
hot
enough
to
melt
anything
he
knew
about
what
the
melting
point
of
this
sky
material
he
never
did
manage
to
make
sather
garm
understand
what
a
melting
point
was
but
he
found
that
one
of
the
solutions
tried
had
been
the
bleeding
of
eleven
certified
virgins
for
seven
days
when
the
blood
was
mixed
with
dragonfeathers
and
frogsdown
and
melded
with
a
genuine
philosopher
stone
they
had
used
it
to
ink
in
the
right
path
of
the
planets
of
a
diagram
it
had
failed
the
sky
had
cracked
and
a
piece
had
fallen
into
the
vessel
of
blood
killing
a
sather
who
was
less
than
two
thousand
years
old
two
thousand
dave
asked
how
old
is
sather
karf
none
remembers
truly
he
has
always
been
the
sather
karf
at
least
ten
thousand
years
or
more
to
attain
the
art
of
a
sather
is
the
work
of
a
score
of
centuries
usually
that
sather
had
been
in
sad
shape
it
seemed
no
one
had
been
able
to
revive
him
though
bringing
the
dead
back
to
life
when
the
body
was
reasonably
intact
was
routine
magic
that
even
a
sersa
could
perform
it
was
after
that
they
begun
conjuring
back
to
dave
world
for
all
the
other
experts
all
whose
true
names
they
could
find
that
is
garm
amended
the
egyptian
pyramid
builder
the
man
who
discovered
your
greatest
science
dianetics
the
great
cagliostro
and
what
a
time
we
had
finding
his
true
name
i
was
assigned
to
the
helping
of
one
who
had
discovered
the
secrets
of
gravity
and
some
strange
magic
which
he
termed
relativity
though
indeed
it
had
little
to
do
with
kinship
but
was
a
private
mystery
but
when
he
was
persuaded
by
divers
means
to
help
us
he
gave
up
after
one
week
declaring
it
beyond
his
powers
they
were
even
planning
what
might
best
be
done
to
chastise
him
when
he
discovered
in
some
manner
a
book
of
elementary
conjuration
and
did
then
devise
some
strange
new
formula
from
the
elements
with
which
magic
he
disappeared
it
was
nice
to
know
that
einstein
had
given
up
on
the
problem
dave
thought
bitterly
as
nice
as
the
discovery
that
there
was
no
fuel
for
the
equipment
here
he
spent
an
hour
rigging
up
a
portable
saw
to
use
in
attempting
to
cut
off
a
smaller
piece
of
the
sky
and
then
saw
the
motor
burn
out
when
he
switched
it
on
it
turned
out
that
all
electricity
here
was
conjured
up
by
commanding
the
electrons
in
a
wire
to
move
in
one
direction
and
completely
useless
with
motors
it
might
have
been
useful
for
welding
but
there
was
no
electric
torch
is
obviously
not
a
thing
of
reason
garm
told
him
severely
if
the
current
in
such
a
form
moves
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
the
other
then
it
cancels
out
and
is
useless
no
you
must
be
wrong
as
dave
remembered
it
tesla
had
been
plagued
by
similar
doubts
from
such
men
as
edison
he
gave
up
and
settled
finally
for
one
of
the
native
welding
torches
filled
with
a
dozen
angry
salamanders
the
flame
or
whatever
it
was
had
enough
heat
but
it
was
hard
to
control
by
the
time
he
learned
to
use
it
night
had
fallen
and
he
was
too
tired
to
try
anything
more
he
ate
a
solitary
supper
and
went
to
sleep
during
the
next
three
days
he
learned
a
few
things
the
hard
way
however
in
spite
of
garm
assurance
that
nothing
could
melt
the
sky
he
found
that
his
sample
would
melt
slowly
under
the
heat
of
the
torch
in
the
liquid
state
it
was
jet
black
though
it
cooled
back
to
complete
transparency
it
was
also
without
weight
when
in
liquid
form
a
fact
he
discovered
when
it
began
rising
through
the
air
and
spattering
over
everything
including
his
bare
skin
the
burns
were
nasty
but
somehow
seemed
to
heal
with
remarkable
speed
sersa
garm
was
impressed
by
the
discoveries
and
went
off
to
suck
his
thumbs
and
brood
over
the
new
knowledge
much
to
dave
relief
more
work
established
the
fact
that
welding
bits
of
the
sky
together
was
not
particularly
difficult
the
liquid
sky
was
perfectly
willing
to
bond
onto
anything
including
other
bits
of
itself
now
if
he
could
get
a
gang
up
the
thousand
miles
to
the
sky
with
enough
torches
to
melt
the
cracks
it
might
recongeal
as
a
perfect
sphere
the
stuff
was
strong
but
somewhat
brittle
he
still
had
no
idea
of
how
to
get
the
stars
and
planets
back
in
the
right
places
the
mathematician
thought
of
such
an
idea
sersa
garm
said
sourly
but
never
work
even
with
much
heat
it
could
not
be
done
for
see
you
the
upper
air
is
filled
with
phlogiston
which
no
man
can
breathe
also
the
phlogiston
has
negative
weight
as
every
school
child
must
know
your
liquid
sky
would
sink
through
it
since
negative
weight
must
in
truth
be
lighter
than
no
weight
while
nothing
else
would
rise
through
the
layer
and
phlogiston
will
quench
the
flame
of
a
rocket
as
your
expert
von
braun
discovered
the
man
was
a
gold
mine
of
information
all
bad
the
only
remaining
solution
apparently
was
to
raise
a
scaffolding
over
the
whole
planet
to
the
sky
and
send
up
mandrakes
to
weld
back
the
broken
pieces
they
would
need
to
breathe
anyhow
with
material
of
infinite
strength
and
an
infinite
supply
of
it
and
with
infinite
time
and
patience
it
might
have
been
worth
considering
nema
came
out
the
next
day
with
more
cheering
information
her
great
grandfather
sather
karf
regretted
it
but
he
must
have
good
news
to
release
at
once
the
populace
was
starving
because
the
food
multipliers
could
produce
reliable
supplies
otherwise
dave
would
find
venom
being
transported
into
his
blood
in
increasing
amounts
until
the
pain
drove
him
mad
and
just
incidentally
the
sons
of
the
egg
who
attacked
him
in
the
hospital
had
tried
to
reach
the
camp
twice
already
once
by
interpenetrating
into
a
shipment
of
mandrakes
which
indicated
to
what
measures
they
would
resort
they
meant
to
kill
him
somehow
and
the
defense
of
him
was
growing
too
costly
unless
there
were
positive
results
dave
hinted
at
having
nearly
reached
the
solution
giving
her
only
a
bit
of
his
wild
idea
of
welding
the
sky
she
took
off
with
that
but
he
was
sure
it
would
satisfy
the
sather
in
that
he
was
right
by
nightfall
when
she
came
back
from
the
city
he
was
groaning
in
pain
the
venom
had
arrived
ahead
of
her
and
his
blood
seemed
to
be
on
fire
she
laid
a
cool
hand
on
his
forehead
poor
dave
she
said
if
i
were
not
registered
and
certified
sometimes
i
feel
that
i
might
but
no
more
of
that
ser
perth
sends
you
this
unguent
which
will
hold
back
the
venom
for
a
time
cautioning
you
not
to
reveal
his
softness
ser
perth
it
seemed
had
reverted
to
his
character
as
expected
and
sather
karf
wants
the
full
plans
at
once
he
is
losing
patience
he
began
rubbing
on
the
ointment
which
helped
slightly
she
peeled
back
his
shirt
and
began
helping
apparently
delighted
with
the
hair
which
he
sprouted
on
his
chest
since
his
reincarnation
the
unguent
helped
but
it
was
enough
he
never
had
any
patience
to
lose
what
the
hell
does
he
expect
me
to
do
dave
asked
hotly
snap
my
fingers
thus
yell
and
give
him
egg
in
his
beer
he
stopped
to
stare
at
his
hand
where
a
can
of
beer
had
suddenly
materialized
nema
squealed
in
delight
what
a
novel
way
to
conjure
dave
let
me
try
it
she
began
snapping
her
fingers
and
saying
the
word
eagerly
but
nothing
happened
finally
she
turned
back
to
him
show
me
again
he
was
sure
it
would
work
twice
and
he
hesitated
not
too
willing
to
have
his
stock
go
down
with
her
then
he
gave
in
he
said
and
snapped
his
fingers
there
were
results
at
once
this
time
an
egg
appeared
in
his
hand
to
the
delighted
cry
of
nema
he
bent
to
look
at
it
uncertainly
it
was
a
strange
looking
egg
more
like
one
of
the
china
eggs
used
to
make
hens
think
they
were
nesting
when
their
eggs
were
still
being
taken
from
them
abruptly
nema
sprang
back
but
she
was
too
late
the
egg
was
growing
it
swelled
to
the
size
of
a
football
then
was
and
growing
to
the
size
of
a
huge
tank
that
filled
most
of
the
tent
suddenly
it
split
open
along
one
side
and
a
group
of
men
in
dull
robes
and
masks
came
spilling
out
of
it
die
the
one
in
front
yelled
he
lifted
a
knife
charged
for
dave
and
brought
the
knife
down
the
blades
went
through
clothing
skin
flesh
and
bones
straight
for
dave
heart
v
the
knife
had
pierced
dave
chest
until
the
hilt
pressed
against
his
rib
cage
he
stared
down
at
it
seeing
it
rise
with
the
heaving
of
his
lungs
yet
he
was
still
alive
then
the
numbness
of
shock
wore
off
and
the
pain
nerves
carried
their
messages
to
his
brain
he
still
lived
but
there
was
unholy
agony
where
the
blade
lay
coughing
and
choking
on
what
must
be
his
own
blood
he
scrabbled
at
the
knife
and
ripped
it
out
blood
jetted
from
the
gaping
rent
in
his
clothing
it
gushed
forth
and
slowed
it
frothed
trickled
and
stopped
entirely
as
he
ripped
his
shirt
back
to
look
the
wound
was
closed
already
but
there
was
no
easing
of
the
pain
that
threatened
to
make
him
black
out
at
any
second
he
heard
shouting
quarreling
voices
but
nothing
made
sense
through
the
haze
of
his
agony
he
felt
someone
grab
at
him
more
than
one
person
and
they
were
dragging
him
across
the
ground
something
was
clutched
around
his
throat
almost
choking
him
he
opened
his
eyes
just
as
something
clicked
behind
him
the
huge
translucent
walls
of
the
monstrous
egg
were
all
around
him
and
the
opened
side
was
closing
the
pain
began
to
abate
the
bleeding
had
already
stopped
entirely
and
his
lungs
seemed
to
have
cleared
themselves
of
the
blood
and
froth
in
them
now
with
the
ache
of
the
wound
ceasing
dave
could
still
feel
the
venom
burning
in
his
blood
and
the
constriction
around
his
throat
was
still
there
making
it
hard
to
breathe
he
sat
up
trying
to
free
himself
the
constriction
came
from
an
arm
around
his
neck
but
he
could
see
to
whom
it
belonged
and
there
was
no
place
to
move
aside
in
the
corner
of
the
egg
from
inside
the
walls
of
the
egg
were
transparent
enough
for
him
to
see
cloudy
outlines
of
what
lay
beyond
he
could
see
the
ground
sweeping
away
beneath
them
from
all
points
a
man
had
run
up
and
was
standing
beside
the
egg
beating
at
it
the
man
suddenly
shot
up
like
a
fountain
growing
huge
he
towered
over
them
until
he
seemed
miles
high
and
the
giant
structures
dave
could
see
were
only
the
toes
of
the
man
shoes
one
of
those
shoes
was
lifting
as
if
the
man
meant
to
step
on
the
egg
they
must
be
growing
smaller
again
a
voice
said
tightly
we
small
enough
bork
can
you
raise
the
wind
for
us
now
hold
on
bork
voice
seemed
sure
of
itself
the
egg
tilted
and
soared
dave
was
thrown
sidewise
and
had
to
fight
for
balance
he
stared
unbelievingly
through
the
crystal
shell
they
rose
like
a
banshee
jet
there
was
a
shaggy
monstrous
colossus
in
the
distance
taller
than
the
himalayas
the
man
who
had
been
beside
them
bork
grunted
got
it
we
all
right
now
he
chanted
something
in
a
rapid
undertone
all
right
relax
that
will
teach
them
not
to
work
resonance
magic
inside
a
protective
ring
the
egg
knows
how
we
could
have
got
through
otherwise
lucky
we
were
trying
at
the
right
time
though
the
satheri
must
be
going
crazy
wait
a
minute
this
tires
the
fingers
the
man
called
bork
halted
the
series
of
rapid
passes
he
had
been
making
flexing
his
fingers
with
a
grimace
the
spinning
egg
began
to
drop
at
once
but
he
let
out
a
long
keening
cry
adding
a
slight
flip
of
his
other
arm
outside
something
like
a
mist
drew
near
and
swirled
around
them
it
looked
huge
to
dave
but
must
have
been
a
small
thing
in
fact
now
they
began
speeding
along
smoothly
again
the
thing
was
probably
another
sylph
strong
enough
to
move
them
in
their
present
reduced
size
bork
pointed
his
finger
there
the
roc
he
leaned
closer
to
the
wall
of
the
tiny
egg
and
shouted
the
sylph
changed
direction
and
began
to
bob
about
it
drifted
gently
while
bork
pulled
a
few
sticks
with
runes
written
on
them
toward
him
and
made
a
hasty
assembly
of
them
at
once
there
was
a
feeling
of
growing
and
the
sylph
began
to
shrink
away
from
them
now
they
were
falling
swiftly
growing
as
they
dropped
dave
felt
his
stomach
twist
until
he
saw
they
were
heading
toward
a
huge
bird
that
was
cruising
along
under
them
drawing
closer
it
looked
like
a
cross
between
a
condor
and
a
hawk
but
its
wing
span
must
have
been
over
three
hundred
feet
it
slipped
under
the
egg
catching
the
falling
object
deftly
on
a
attachment
between
its
wings
and
then
struck
off
briskly
toward
the
east
bork
snapped
the
side
of
the
egg
open
and
stepped
out
while
the
others
followed
dave
tried
to
crawl
out
but
something
held
him
back
it
was
until
bork
big
hand
reached
in
to
help
him
that
he
made
it
when
all
were
out
bork
tapped
the
object
and
caught
it
as
it
shrank
when
it
was
small
enough
he
pocketed
it
dave
sat
up
again
examining
himself
now
that
he
had
more
room
his
clothing
was
a
mess
spattered
with
drying
blood
but
he
seemed
unharmed
now
even
the
burning
of
the
venom
was
gone
he
reached
for
the
arm
around
his
neck
and
began
breaking
it
free
from
its
stranglehold
from
behind
an
incredulous
cry
broke
out
nema
sprawled
across
him
staring
at
his
face
and
burying
her
head
against
his
shoulder
dave
you
not
dead
you
alive
dave
was
still
amazed
at
that
himself
but
bork
snorted
of
course
he
is
why
we
take
him
along
with
you
hanging
on
in
a
faint
if
he
were
dead
when
the
kills
it
kills
completely
they
stay
dead
or
they
do
die
sagittarian
she
nodded
and
the
big
man
seemed
to
be
doing
some
calculations
in
his
head
yeah
he
decided
it
would
be
there
was
one
second
there
around
midnight
when
all
the
signs
were
at
their
absolute
maximum
favorableness
someone
must
have
said
some
pretty
dangerous
health
spells
over
him
then
he
turned
to
dave
as
if
aware
that
the
other
was
comparatively
ignorant
of
such
matters
happened
once
before
without
this
of
the
signs
they
revived
a
corpse
and
found
he
was
unkillable
from
then
on
he
lasted
eight
thousand
years
or
something
like
that
before
he
got
burned
trying
to
control
a
giant
salamander
they
cut
off
his
head
once
but
it
healed
before
the
axe
was
all
the
way
through
woops
the
bird
had
dipped
downward
rushing
toward
the
ground
it
landed
at
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
and
managed
to
stop
against
a
small
entrance
to
a
cave
in
the
hillside
except
for
the
one
patch
where
the
bird
had
lighted
they
were
in
the
middle
of
a
dense
forest
dave
and
nema
were
hustled
into
the
cave
while
the
others
melted
into
the
woods
studying
the
skies
she
clung
to
dave
crying
something
about
how
the
sons
of
the
egg
would
torture
them
all
right
he
said
finally
who
are
these
sons
of
eggs
and
what
have
they
got
against
me
they
monsters
she
told
him
they
used
to
be
the
antimagic
individualists
they
wanted
magic
used
only
when
other
means
work
they
fought
against
the
satheri
while
magic
produced
their
food
and
made
a
better
world
for
them
they
hated
it
because
they
could
do
it
for
themselves
and
a
few
renegade
priests
like
my
brother
joined
them
your
brother
she
means
me
bork
said
he
came
in
to
drop
on
his
haunches
and
grin
at
dave
there
was
no
sign
of
personal
hatred
in
his
look
i
used
to
be
a
stooge
for
sather
karf
before
i
got
sick
of
it
how
do
you
feel
dave
hanson
dave
considered
it
still
in
wonder
at
the
truth
i
feel
good
even
the
venom
they
were
putting
in
my
blood
does
seem
to
hurt
any
more
fine
means
the
sather
karf
must
believe
we
killed
you
he
must
have
the
report
by
now
if
he
thinks
you
dead
there
no
point
in
his
giving
chase
he
knows
i
would
let
them
kill
nema
even
if
she
is
a
little
fool
anyhow
he
not
really
such
a
bad
old
guy
dave
not
like
some
of
those
satheri
well
you
figure
how
you
like
it
if
you
were
just
a
simple
man
and
some
priest
magicked
her
away
from
you
and
then
sent
her
back
with
enough
magic
of
her
own
to
be
a
witch
and
make
life
hell
for
you
because
she
been
kicked
out
by
the
priest
but
he
pulled
the
wanting
spell
off
her
or
anything
else
you
wanted
and
could
keep
against
magic
sure
they
fed
us
they
had
to
after
they
took
away
our
fields
and
the
kine
and
got
everyone
into
the
habit
of
taking
their
dole
instead
of
earning
our
living
in
the
old
way
they
made
slaves
of
us
any
man
who
lets
another
be
responsible
for
him
a
slave
it
a
fine
world
for
the
satheri
if
they
can
keep
the
egg
from
breaking
what
all
this
egg
nonsense
bork
shrugged
plain
good
sense
why
should
there
be
a
sky
shell
around
the
planet
look
there
a
legend
here
you
should
know
it
since
for
all
i
know
it
has
some
meaning
for
you
long
ago
or
away
or
whatever
there
was
a
world
called
tharé
and
another
called
erath
two
worlds
separate
and
distinct
on
their
own
branching
time
paths
they
must
have
been
that
way
since
the
moment
of
creation
one
was
a
world
of
rule
and
law
one
plus
one
might
not
always
equal
two
but
it
had
to
equal
something
there
seems
to
be
some
similarity
to
your
world
in
that
does
there
the
other
was
well
you
call
it
chaos
though
it
had
some
laws
if
they
could
be
predicted
one
plus
one
there
depended
or
maybe
there
was
no
such
thing
as
unity
conserved
it
was
deserved
it
was
a
world
of
anarchy
from
your
point
of
view
it
must
have
been
a
terrible
place
to
live
i
guess
he
hesitated
somberly
as
terrible
as
this
one
is
getting
to
be
he
said
at
last
anyway
there
were
people
who
lived
there
there
were
the
two
inhabited
worlds
in
their
own
time
lines
or
probability
orbits
or
whatever
you
know
i
suppose
how
worlds
of
probability
would
separate
and
diverge
as
time
goes
on
of
course
well
these
two
worlds
he
looked
searchingly
at
dave
do
you
see
it
the
two
time
lines
came
together
two
opposites
fused
into
one
do
ask
me
to
explain
it
it
was
long
ago
and
all
i
know
for
sure
is
that
it
happened
the
two
worlds
met
and
fused
and
out
of
the
two
came
this
world
in
what
the
books
call
the
when
it
was
over
our
world
was
as
it
has
been
for
thousands
of
centuries
in
fact
one
result
was
that
in
theory
neither
original
world
could
have
a
real
past
and
the
fusion
was
something
that
had
been
no
period
of
change
it
pretty
complicated
it
sounds
worse
than
that
dave
grumbled
but
while
that
might
explain
the
mystery
of
magic
working
here
it
does
explain
your
sky
bork
scratched
his
head
no
not
too
well
he
admitted
i
always
had
some
doubts
about
whether
or
not
all
the
worlds
have
a
shell
around
them
i
do
know
but
our
world
does
and
the
shell
is
cracking
the
satheri
do
like
it
they
want
to
stop
it
we
want
it
to
happen
for
the
two
lines
that
met
and
fused
into
one
have
an
analogue
does
the
story
of
that
fusion
suggest
something
to
you
dave
hanson
do
you
see
it
the
male
principle
of
rule
and
the
female
principle
of
whim
they
join
and
the
egg
is
fertile
two
universes
join
and
the
result
is
a
nucleus
world
surrounded
by
a
shell
like
an
egg
we
a
universe
egg
and
when
an
egg
hatches
you
do
try
to
put
it
back
together
he
did
look
like
a
fanatic
dave
told
himself
crazy
or
not
he
took
this
business
of
the
hatching
egg
seriously
but
you
could
never
be
sure
about
anyone
who
joined
a
cult
what
is
your
egg
going
to
hatch
into
he
asked
the
big
man
shrugged
does
an
egg
know
it
is
going
to
become
a
hen
or
maybe
a
fish
we
ca
possibly
tell
of
course
dave
considered
it
do
you
even
have
a
guess
bork
answered
shortly
no
he
looked
worried
dave
thought
and
guessed
that
even
the
fanatics
were
not
quite
sure
they
to
be
hatched
bork
shrugged
again
an
egg
has
got
to
hatch
he
said
that
all
there
is
to
it
we
prophesied
this
oh
two
hundred
years
ago
the
satheri
laughed
now
they
stopped
laughing
but
they
want
to
stop
it
what
happens
to
a
chick
when
it
is
stopped
from
hatching
does
it
go
on
being
a
chick
or
does
it
die
it
dies
of
course
and
we
do
want
to
die
no
dave
hanson
we
do
know
what
happens
next
but
we
do
know
that
we
must
go
through
with
it
i
have
nothing
against
you
personally
but
i
ca
let
you
stop
us
that
why
we
tried
to
kill
you
if
i
could
i
kill
you
now
with
the
so
they
could
revive
you
dave
said
reasonably
you
ca
expect
me
to
like
it
you
know
the
satheri
at
least
saved
my
life
he
stopped
in
confusion
bork
was
staring
at
him
in
hilarious
incredulousness
that
broke
into
roars
of
laughter
you
mean
dave
hanson
do
you
believe
everything
they
tell
you
do
you
know
that
the
satheri
arranged
to
kill
you
first
they
needed
a
favorable
death
conjunction
to
bring
you
back
to
life
they
got
it
by
arranging
an
accident
nema
cried
out
in
protest
that
a
lie
of
course
bork
said
mildly
you
always
were
on
their
side
little
sister
you
were
also
usually
a
darned
nuisance
fond
as
i
was
of
you
come
here
he
caught
her
and
yanked
a
single
hair
out
of
her
head
she
screamed
and
tried
to
claw
him
then
fought
for
the
hair
bork
was
immovable
he
held
her
off
easily
with
one
hand
while
the
fingers
of
the
other
danced
in
the
air
he
spoke
what
seemed
to
be
a
name
though
it
bore
no
resemblance
to
nema
she
quieted
trembling
you
find
a
broom
near
the
entrance
little
sister
take
it
and
go
back
to
forget
that
dave
hanson
lives
you
saw
him
die
and
were
dragged
off
with
us
and
his
body
you
escaped
before
we
reached
our
hideaway
by
the
knot
i
tie
in
your
true
hair
and
by
your
secret
name
this
i
command
she
blinked
slowly
and
looked
around
as
bork
burned
the
knotted
hair
her
eyes
swept
past
bork
and
dave
without
seeing
them
and
centered
on
the
broom
one
man
held
out
to
her
without
appearing
to
see
him
either
she
seized
the
broom
a
sob
came
to
her
throat
the
devil
the
renegade
devil
he
did
have
to
kill
dave
he
did
her
voice
died
away
as
she
ran
toward
the
clearing
dave
made
no
protest
he
suspected
bork
was
putting
the
spell
on
her
for
her
own
good
and
he
agreed
that
she
was
better
out
of
all
this
now
where
were
we
bork
asked
oh
yes
i
was
trying
to
convert
you
and
knowing
i
failed
already
of
course
i
do
know
that
they
killed
you
first
but
those
are
their
methods
take
it
from
me
i
know
i
was
the
youngest
ser
ever
to
be
accepted
for
training
as
a
sather
they
wanted
you
so
they
got
you
dave
considered
it
it
seemed
as
likely
as
anything
else
why
me
he
asked
because
you
can
put
back
the
sky
at
least
the
satheri
think
so
and
i
must
admit
that
in
some
ways
they
are
smarter
than
we
dave
started
to
protest
but
bork
cut
him
off
i
know
all
about
your
big
secret
you
not
the
engineer
whose
true
name
was
longer
we
know
all
that
our
pools
are
closer
to
perfection
than
theirs
not
being
contaminated
by
city
air
and
we
see
more
but
there
is
a
cycle
of
confirmation
if
prophecy
indicates
a
thing
will
happen
it
will
happen
though
not
always
as
expected
the
prophecy
fulfills
itself
rather
than
being
fulfilled
then
there
are
the
words
on
the
monument
a
monument
meant
for
your
uncle
but
carrying
your
true
name
because
his
friends
felt
the
short
form
sounded
better
it
was
something
of
a
coincidence
that
they
had
the
wrong
true
name
but
prophecy
is
always
strongest
when
based
on
coincidence
that
is
a
prime
rule
and
those
words
coupled
with
our
revelations
prophesy
that
not
your
uncle
can
do
the
impossible
so
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
you
bork
attitude
was
reassuring
somehow
it
was
nearer
his
own
than
any
dave
had
heard
on
this
world
and
the
kidnapping
was
beginning
to
look
like
a
relief
the
sons
of
the
egg
had
gotten
him
off
the
hook
with
sather
karf
he
grinned
and
stretched
back
if
i
unkillable
bork
what
can
you
do
the
big
man
grinned
back
flow
rock
around
you
up
to
your
nose
and
toss
you
into
a
lake
you
live
there
but
you
always
be
drowning
and
you
find
it
slightly
unpleasant
for
the
next
few
thousand
years
not
as
bad
as
being
turned
into
a
mangrove
with
your
soul
intact
but
it
would
last
longer
and
do
think
the
satheri
ca
pull
a
lot
worse
than
that
they
have
your
name
everyone
has
your
secret
name
here
and
parts
of
you
the
conversation
was
suddenly
less
pleasant
dave
thought
it
over
i
could
stay
here
and
join
your
group
i
might
as
well
since
i
really
help
the
satheri
anyhow
they
spot
your
aura
eventually
they
be
checking
around
here
for
us
for
a
while
of
course
we
might
do
something
about
it
if
you
really
converted
but
i
do
think
you
would
if
you
knew
more
bork
got
up
and
headed
for
the
entrance
i
was
going
to
let
you
see
the
risings
but
now
maybe
i
will
if
you
still
want
to
join
it
might
be
worked
otherwise
i
think
of
something
else
dave
followed
the
man
out
into
the
clearing
a
few
men
were
just
planning
to
leave
and
they
looked
at
dave
suspiciously
but
made
no
protest
one
whom
dave
recognized
as
the
leader
with
the
scowled
the
risings
are
almost
due
bork
he
said
bork
nodded
i
know
malok
i
decided
to
let
dave
hanson
watch
dave
this
is
our
leader
here
res
malok
dave
felt
no
strong
love
for
his
murderer
and
it
seemed
to
be
mutual
but
no
protest
was
lodged
apparently
bork
was
their
top
conjurer
and
privileged
they
crossed
the
clearing
and
went
through
the
woods
toward
another
smaller
one
here
a
group
of
some
fifty
men
were
watching
the
sky
obviously
waiting
others
stood
around
watching
them
and
avoiding
looking
up
almost
directly
overhead
there
was
a
rent
place
where
the
strange
absence
of
color
or
feature
indicated
a
hole
in
the
dome
over
them
as
it
drew
nearer
true
vertical
a
chanting
began
among
the
men
with
faces
their
hands
went
upwards
fingers
spread
and
curled
into
an
unnatural
position
then
they
stood
waiting
i
do
like
it
bork
whispered
to
dave
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
we
growing
too
weak
to
fight
the
satheri
what
wrong
with
a
ceremony
of
worship
if
you
must
worship
your
eggshell
dave
asked
you
see
that
was
all
it
was
once
just
worship
but
now
for
weeks
things
are
changing
they
think
it
a
sign
of
favor
but
i
do
know
there
watch
the
hole
in
the
sky
was
directly
overhead
now
and
the
moaning
had
risen
in
pitch
across
the
little
clearing
malok
began
backing
quietly
away
carefully
not
looking
upwards
nobody
but
dave
seemed
to
notice
his
absence
there
was
a
louder
moan
one
of
the
men
in
the
clearing
began
to
rise
upwards
slowly
his
body
was
rigid
as
it
lifted
a
foot
ten
feet
then
a
hundred
above
the
ground
now
it
picked
up
speed
and
rushed
upwards
another
began
to
rise
and
another
in
seconds
more
than
half
of
those
who
had
waited
were
screaming
upwards
toward
the
hole
in
the
sky
they
disappeared
in
the
distance
those
who
had
merely
stood
by
and
those
who
had
worshipped
waited
a
few
seconds
more
but
no
more
rose
the
men
sighed
and
began
moving
out
of
the
clearing
dave
arose
to
follow
but
bork
gestured
for
him
to
wait
sometimes
he
said
they
were
alone
now
still
bork
waited
staring
upwards
then
dave
saw
something
in
the
sky
a
speck
appeared
and
came
hurtling
down
in
seconds
it
was
the
body
of
one
of
the
men
who
had
risen
dave
felt
his
stomach
tighten
and
braced
himself
there
was
no
slowing
as
the
body
fell
it
landed
in
the
center
of
the
clearing
without
losing
speed
but
with
less
noise
than
he
had
expected
when
they
reached
the
shattered
body
there
could
be
no
question
of
its
being
dead
bork
face
was
solemn
if
you
thinking
of
joining
you
better
know
the
worst
you
too
easily
shocked
to
make
a
good
convert
unless
you
prepared
the
risings
have
been
going
on
for
some
time
malok
swears
it
proves
we
are
right
but
i
seen
five
other
bodies
come
down
like
this
what
does
it
mean
are
they
stillborn
we
do
know
shall
i
revive
him
for
you
dave
felt
sick
as
he
stared
at
the
ghastly
terror
on
the
face
of
the
corpse
the
last
thing
he
wanted
to
see
was
its
revival
but
his
curiosity
about
the
secret
in
the
sky
could
not
be
denied
he
nodded
bork
drew
a
set
of
phials
and
implements
in
miniature
size
from
under
his
robe
this
is
routine
he
said
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
produced
a
small
flame
over
the
heart
of
the
corpse
into
that
he
began
dusting
powders
mixing
them
with
something
that
looked
like
blood
finally
he
called
a
name
and
a
command
there
was
a
sharp
explosion
a
hissing
and
bork
voice
calling
the
dead
man
flowed
together
and
was
whole
he
stood
up
woodenly
with
his
face
frozen
who
calls
he
asked
in
an
uninflected
hollow
voice
why
am
i
called
i
have
no
soul
we
call
bork
answered
tell
us
what
you
saw
at
the
hole
in
the
sky
a
scream
tore
from
the
throat
of
the
thing
and
its
hands
came
up
to
its
eyes
tearing
at
them
its
mouth
worked
soundlessly
and
breath
sucked
in
then
a
single
word
came
out
faces
it
fell
onto
the
grass
distorted
in
death
again
bork
shuddered
the
others
were
the
same
he
said
and
he
ca
be
revived
again
even
the
strongest
spell
ca
bring
back
his
soul
that
is
gone
somehow
dave
shivered
and
knowing
that
you
still
fight
against
repairing
the
sky
hatching
is
probably
always
horrible
from
inside
the
shell
bork
answered
do
you
still
want
to
join
us
no
i
thought
not
well
then
let
go
back
we
might
as
well
try
to
eat
something
while
i
think
about
what
to
do
with
you
malok
and
most
of
the
others
were
gone
when
they
reached
the
cave
again
bork
fell
to
work
with
some
scraps
of
food
cursing
the
configurations
of
the
planets
as
his
spell
refused
to
work
then
suddenly
the
scraps
became
a
mass
of
stuff
bork
made
a
face
as
he
tasted
it
but
he
ate
it
in
silence
dave
could
force
himself
to
put
it
in
his
mouth
though
he
was
hungry
by
then
he
considered
and
then
snapped
his
fingers
abracadabra
he
cried
he
swore
as
something
wet
and
slimy
that
looked
like
seaweed
plopped
into
his
hand
the
next
time
he
got
a
limp
fish
that
had
been
dead
far
too
long
but
the
third
try
worked
better
this
time
a
whole
bunch
of
bananas
appeared
they
were
a
little
riper
than
he
liked
but
some
of
them
were
edible
enough
he
handed
some
to
the
other
man
who
quickly
abandoned
his
own
creation
bork
was
thoughtful
as
he
ate
finally
he
grimaced
new
magic
he
said
maybe
that
the
secret
of
the
prophecy
i
thought
you
knew
no
magic
i
did
dave
admitted
he
was
still
tingling
inside
himself
at
this
confirmation
of
his
earlier
discovery
it
was
unpredictable
magic
but
apparently
bore
some
vague
relationship
to
what
he
was
wishing
for
so
the
lake
out
bork
decided
with
unknown
powers
at
your
command
you
might
escape
in
time
well
that
settles
it
there
one
place
where
nobody
will
look
for
you
or
listen
to
you
you
be
nothing
but
another
among
millions
and
that
probably
the
best
hiding
place
for
you
with
the
overseers
they
have
you
could
even
turn
yourself
back
to
the
satheri
though
i
admit
i
hoping
you
do
want
them
to
find
you
and
i
was
beginning
to
think
you
liked
me
dave
commented
bitterly
bork
grinned
i
do
dave
hanson
that
why
i
picking
the
easiest
place
to
hide
you
i
can
think
of
it
will
be
hell
but
anything
else
would
be
worse
better
strip
and
put
this
cloth
on
the
thing
he
held
out
was
little
more
than
a
rag
apparently
torn
from
one
of
the
robes
come
on
strip
or
i
burn
off
your
clothes
with
a
salamander
there
that
better
now
wrap
the
cloth
around
your
waist
and
let
it
hang
down
in
front
it
be
easier
on
you
if
you
attract
much
attention
the
sky
seems
to
indicate
the
planets
favor
teleportation
now
be
quick
before
i
change
my
mind
and
think
of
something
worse
dave
did
see
what
he
did
this
time
but
there
was
a
puff
of
flame
in
front
of
his
eyes
the
next
second
he
stood
manacled
in
a
long
line
of
men
loaded
with
heavy
stones
over
their
backs
fell
the
cutting
lashes
of
a
whip
far
ahead
was
a
partially
finished
pyramid
dave
was
obviously
one
of
the
building
slaves
vi
sunrise
glared
harshly
over
the
desert
it
was
already
hot
enough
to
send
heat
waves
dancing
over
the
sand
as
hanson
wakened
under
the
bite
of
a
lash
the
overseers
were
shouting
and
kicking
the
slaves
awake
overhead
the
marred
sky
shone
in
crazy
quilt
patterns
hanson
stood
up
taking
the
final
bite
of
the
whip
without
flinching
he
glanced
down
at
his
body
noticing
that
it
had
somehow
developed
a
healthy
deep
tan
during
the
few
hours
of
murderous
labor
the
day
before
he
was
particularly
surprised
something
in
his
mind
seemed
also
to
have
developed
a
tan
that
let
him
face
the
bite
of
chance
without
flinching
he
stopped
wondering
and
now
accepted
he
meant
to
get
away
from
here
at
the
first
chance
and
he
was
somehow
sure
he
could
it
was
made
easier
by
the
boundless
strength
of
his
new
body
he
showed
no
signs
of
buckling
under
physical
work
that
would
have
killed
him
on
his
own
world
not
all
the
slaves
got
up
two
beside
him
did
move
at
all
sleeping
through
that
brutal
awakening
seemed
impossible
when
hanson
looked
closer
he
saw
that
they
were
asleep
they
were
dead
the
overseer
raged
back
along
the
line
and
saw
them
he
must
be
one
of
those
conjured
into
existence
here
from
the
real
egypt
of
the
past
he
might
have
no
soul
but
a
lifetime
of
being
an
overseer
had
given
him
habits
that
replaced
the
need
for
what
had
been
a
pretty
slim
soul
to
begin
with
quitters
he
yelled
lazy
worthless
goldbrick
artists
he
knelt
in
fury
thumbing
back
the
eyelids
of
the
corpses
there
was
little
need
for
the
test
they
were
too
limp
too
waxen
to
be
pretending
the
overseer
cut
them
out
of
the
chain
and
kicked
at
hanson
move
along
he
bellowed
menes
himself
is
here
and
he
not
as
gentle
as
i
am
hanson
joined
the
long
line
wondering
what
they
were
going
to
do
about
breakfast
how
the
devil
did
they
expect
the
slaves
to
put
in
sixteen
hours
of
work
without
some
kind
of
food
there
had
been
nothing
the
night
before
but
a
skin
of
water
there
was
not
even
that
much
this
morning
no
wonder
the
two
beside
him
had
died
from
overwork
beatings
and
plain
starvation
menes
was
there
all
right
hanson
saw
him
from
the
distance
a
skinny
giant
of
a
man
in
breechclout
cape
and
golden
headdress
he
bore
a
whip
like
everyone
else
who
seemed
to
have
any
authority
at
all
but
he
was
using
it
he
was
standing
hawklike
on
a
slight
rise
in
the
sandy
earth
motionless
and
silent
beside
him
was
a
shorter
figure
a
pudgy
man
with
a
thin
mustache
on
whom
the
egyptian
headdress
looked
strangely
out
of
place
it
could
only
be
ser
perth
hanson
staring
came
to
an
end
as
the
lash
cut
down
across
his
shoulders
biting
through
to
the
he
stumbled
forward
heedless
of
the
overseers
shouting
voices
someday
if
he
had
the
chance
he
flay
his
own
overseer
but
that
could
wait
even
the
agony
of
the
cut
could
take
his
mind
from
ser
perth
presence
had
bork
slipped
up
did
the
satheri
know
that
hanson
was
still
alive
and
had
they
sent
ser
perth
here
to
locate
him
it
seemed
unlikely
however
the
man
was
paying
no
attention
to
the
lines
of
slaves
it
would
be
hard
to
spot
one
among
three
million
anyhow
more
likely
hanson
decided
ser
perth
was
supervising
the
supervisors
making
an
inspection
tour
of
all
this
of
all
what
apparently
then
this
must
be
another
of
their
frenzied
efforts
to
find
a
way
to
put
back
the
sky
he
heard
that
they
had
called
up
the
pyramid
builder
but
had
fully
realized
it
would
lead
to
this
type
of
activity
he
looked
around
him
appraisingly
the
long
lines
of
slaves
that
had
been
carrying
rock
and
rubble
the
day
before
now
were
being
formed
into
hauling
teams
long
ropes
were
looped
around
enormous
slabs
of
quarried
rock
rollers
underneath
them
and
slaves
tugging
and
pushing
at
them
were
the
only
means
of
moving
them
the
huge
stones
slid
remorselessly
forward
onto
the
prepared
beds
of
rubble
casting
back
in
his
memory
hanson
could
not
recall
seeing
the
rock
slabs
the
night
before
they
had
appeared
as
if
by
magic
obviously
they
had
really
been
conjured
up
by
magic
but
if
the
rocks
could
be
conjured
what
was
the
need
of
all
the
slaves
and
the
sadistic
overseers
why
not
simply
magic
the
entire
construction
whatever
it
was
to
be
the
whip
hit
him
again
and
the
raging
voice
of
the
overseer
ranted
in
his
ears
get
on
you
blundering
slacker
menes
himself
is
looking
at
you
ho
there
what
the
devil
the
overseer
hand
spun
hanson
around
the
man
eyes
large
and
opaque
stared
at
hanson
he
frowned
cruelly
yeah
you
the
same
one
did
i
take
the
hide
off
your
back
twice
already
and
now
you
stand
there
without
a
scar
or
a
drop
of
blood
hanson
grunted
feebly
he
did
want
attention
called
to
himself
while
ser
perth
was
around
i
i
heal
quickly
it
was
no
more
than
the
truth
either
the
body
they
given
him
or
the
conjuring
during
the
right
split
second
had
enabled
him
to
heal
almost
before
a
blow
was
struck
magic
the
overseer
scowled
and
gave
hanson
a
shove
that
sent
him
sprawling
blithering
magic
again
magic
stones
that
melt
when
you
get
them
in
place
magic
slaves
that
the
whip
wo
touch
and
they
expect
us
to
do
a
job
of
work
such
as
not
even
thoth
could
dream
up
they
take
honest
work
no
they
have
to
come
snooping
and
conjuring
and
interfering
wheels
on
rollers
tools
of
steel
and
the
gods
know
what
instead
of
honest
stone
magic
to
lift
things
instead
of
honest
ropes
that
shrink
and
wood
that
swells
magic
that
fails
and
rush
rush
rush
until
i
half
ready
to
be
tortured
for
falling
behind
and
you
you
would
would
you
his
voice
trailed
off
into
a
fresh
roar
of
rage
as
he
caught
sight
of
other
slaves
taking
advantage
of
his
attention
to
hanson
to
relax
he
raced
off
brandishing
the
whip
hanson
tried
to
make
himself
inconspicuous
after
that
the
wounds
would
heal
and
the
beatings
could
never
kill
him
but
there
had
been
no
provision
in
his
new
body
for
the
suppression
of
pain
he
hungered
thirsted
and
suffered
like
anyone
else
maybe
he
was
learning
to
take
it
here
but
not
to
like
it
at
the
expense
of
a
hundred
slaves
and
considerable
deterioration
of
the
whips
one
block
of
stone
was
in
place
before
the
sun
was
high
overhead
in
the
coppery
mottled
sky
then
there
was
the
blessing
of
a
pause
men
were
coming
down
the
long
lines
handing
something
to
the
slaves
food
hanson
anticipated
he
was
wrong
when
the
slave
with
the
wicker
basket
came
closer
he
could
see
that
the
contents
were
not
food
but
some
powdery
stuff
that
was
dipped
out
with
carved
spoons
into
the
eager
hands
of
the
slaves
hanson
smelled
his
portion
dubiously
it
was
cloying
sickly
sweet
hashish
or
opium
heroin
hemp
hanson
was
no
expert
but
it
was
certainly
some
kind
of
drug
judging
by
the
avid
way
the
other
slaves
were
gulping
it
down
each
one
of
them
had
been
exposed
to
it
before
hanson
cautiously
made
the
pretense
of
swallowing
his
before
he
allowed
it
to
slip
through
his
fingers
to
mingle
with
the
sand
drug
addiction
was
obviously
a
convenient
way
to
make
the
slaves
forget
their
aches
and
fears
to
keep
them
everlasting
anxious
to
please
whatever
was
necessary
to
make
sure
the
precious
deadly
ration
never
stopped
there
was
still
no
sign
of
food
the
pause
in
the
labor
was
only
for
the
length
of
time
it
took
the
slaves
to
complete
their
task
ten
minutes
or
fifteen
at
the
outside
then
the
overseers
were
back
with
the
orders
and
the
lashes
the
slaves
regrouped
on
new
jobs
and
hanson
found
himself
in
a
bunch
of
a
dozen
or
so
they
were
lashing
the
hauling
ropes
around
a
block
of
stone
the
rollers
were
already
in
place
with
the
crudely
plaited
ropes
dangling
loosely
hanson
found
himself
being
lifted
by
a
couple
of
the
other
slaves
to
the
shoulders
of
a
third
his
clawing
hands
caught
the
top
of
the
block
and
the
slaves
below
heaved
him
upward
he
scrambled
to
the
top
and
caught
the
ropes
that
were
flung
up
to
him
from
his
vantage
point
he
saw
what
he
had
not
seen
before
the
amazing
size
of
the
construction
project
this
was
no
piffling
little
gizeh
pyramid
no
simple
tomb
for
a
king
its
base
was
measured
in
kilometers
instead
of
yards
and
its
top
was
going
to
be
proportionally
high
apparently
it
hardly
seemed
that
there
could
be
enough
stone
in
the
whole
world
to
finish
the
job
as
far
as
hanson
could
see
over
the
level
sand
the
ground
was
black
with
the
suffering
millions
of
slaves
in
their
labor
gangs
the
idiots
must
be
trying
to
reach
the
sky
with
their
pyramid
there
could
be
no
other
answer
to
the
immense
bulk
planned
for
this
structure
like
the
men
of
babel
they
were
building
a
thing
of
stone
it
was
obviously
impossible
and
even
menes
must
be
aware
of
that
yet
perhaps
it
was
no
more
impossible
than
all
the
rest
of
the
things
in
this
impossible
world
when
the
warlocks
of
this
world
had
discovered
that
they
could
not
solve
the
problem
of
the
sky
they
must
have
gone
into
a
state
of
pure
hysteria
like
a
chicken
dashing
back
and
forth
in
front
of
a
car
they
had
sought
through
other
worlds
and
ages
for
anyone
with
a
reputation
as
a
builder
engineer
or
construction
genius
without
screening
the
probability
of
finding
an
answer
the
size
of
the
ancient
pyramid
must
have
been
enough
to
sway
them
they
had
used
hanson
menes
einstein
cagliostro
for
some
reason
of
their
own
since
he
never
been
a
builder
and
probably
a
thousand
more
and
then
they
had
all
of
them
rather
than
picking
the
most
likely
few
and
giving
full
cooperation
magic
must
have
made
solutions
to
most
things
so
easy
that
they
no
longer
had
the
guts
to
try
the
impossible
themselves
a
pyramid
seemed
like
a
ridiculous
solution
but
for
an
incredible
task
an
impossible
solution
had
to
be
tried
and
maybe
he
thought
they
overlooked
the
obvious
in
their
own
system
the
solution
to
a
problem
in
magic
should
logically
be
found
in
magic
not
in
the
methods
of
other
worlds
his
mind
groped
for
something
that
almost
came
into
his
consciousness
some
inkling
of
what
should
have
been
done
or
how
they
had
failed
it
was
probably
only
an
idle
fancy
but
hey
one
of
the
slaves
below
was
waving
at
him
while
hanson
looked
down
the
slave
called
to
another
got
a
shoulder
to
lean
on
and
walked
his
way
up
the
side
of
the
block
pushed
from
below
and
helped
by
hanson
hands
above
he
was
panting
when
he
reached
the
top
but
he
could
still
talk
look
it
your
skin
but
you
going
to
be
in
trouble
if
you
do
get
busy
look
out
for
that
overseer
up
there
do
just
stand
around
when
he
in
sight
he
picked
up
a
loop
of
rope
and
passed
it
to
hanson
making
a
great
show
of
hard
work
hanson
stared
up
at
the
overseer
who
was
staring
back
at
him
why
is
he
any
worse
than
the
rest
of
this
crowd
the
slave
shuddered
as
the
dour
overseer
began
walking
stiffly
toward
them
do
let
the
fact
that
he
an
overseer
fool
you
he
smarter
than
most
of
his
kind
but
just
as
ugly
he
a
mandrake
and
you
ca
afford
to
mess
with
him
hanson
looked
at
the
ancient
wrinkled
face
of
the
mandrake
and
shuddered
there
was
the
complete
incarnation
of
inhumanity
in
the
thing
expression
he
passed
ropes
around
the
corners
until
the
mandrake
turned
and
rigidly
marched
away
the
blows
of
his
whip
falling
on
the
slaves
he
passed
thanks
hanson
said
i
wonder
what
it
like
being
a
true
mandrake
depends
the
slave
said
easily
he
was
obviously
more
intelligent
than
most
and
better
at
conserving
himself
some
are
real
i
mean
the
magicians
want
somebody
whom
they
ca
just
call
back
direct
translation
of
the
body
usually
messes
up
the
brain
patterns
enough
to
make
the
thinkers
hard
to
use
especially
with
the
sky
falling
so
they
get
his
name
and
some
hold
on
his
soul
and
then
rebuild
his
body
around
a
mandrake
root
they
bind
his
soul
into
that
and
in
some
ways
almost
human
sometimes
they
even
improve
on
what
he
was
but
the
true
mandrake
like
that
one
never
was
human
just
an
ugly
filthy
simulacrum
it
bad
business
i
never
liked
it
even
though
i
was
in
training
for
sersa
rating
you
from
this
world
hanson
asked
in
surprise
he
been
assuming
that
the
man
was
one
of
the
things
called
back
a
lot
of
us
are
they
conscripted
a
lot
of
the
people
they
did
need
for
these
jobs
but
i
was
a
little
special
all
right
maybe
you
believe
me
you
think
they
would
send
a
student
sersa
here
now
look
i
can
prove
it
i
managed
to
sneak
one
of
the
books
i
was
studying
back
with
me
see
he
drew
a
thin
volume
from
his
breechclout
cautiously
then
slipped
it
back
again
you
do
get
such
books
unless
you
at
least
of
student
rating
he
sighed
then
shrugged
my
trouble
is
that
i
could
never
keep
my
mouth
shut
i
was
attendant
at
one
of
the
revivatoria
and
i
got
drunk
enough
to
let
out
some
information
about
one
of
the
important
revival
cases
so
here
i
am
umm
hanson
worked
silently
for
a
minute
wondering
how
far
coincidence
could
go
it
could
go
a
long
ways
here
he
decided
you
would
have
been
sentenced
to
twenty
lifetimes
here
by
the
sather
karf
would
you
the
slave
stared
at
him
in
surprise
you
guessed
it
i
died
only
fourteen
times
so
far
so
i
got
six
more
lives
to
go
but
hey
you
ca
be
they
were
counting
on
you
to
be
the
one
who
really
fixed
things
do
tell
me
my
talking
out
of
turn
did
this
to
you
hanson
reassured
him
on
that
he
recognized
the
man
now
for
another
reason
are
you
the
one
i
saw
dead
on
his
back
right
next
to
me
this
morning
probably
name
barg
he
stood
up
to
take
a
careful
look
at
the
net
of
cording
around
the
stone
looks
sound
enough
yeah
i
died
this
morning
which
is
why
i
fairly
fresh
now
those
overseers
wo
feed
us
because
it
takes
time
and
wastes
food
they
let
us
die
and
then
have
us
dragged
back
for
more
work
it
a
lot
easier
on
the
ones
they
dragged
back
already
dead
dying
does
matter
so
much
without
a
soul
some
of
them
seem
to
be
indians
hanson
noted
he
had
paid
too
much
attention
but
the
slaves
seemed
to
be
from
every
possible
background
barg
nodded
aztecs
from
a
place
called
tenochtitlan
twenty
thousand
of
them
got
sacrificed
in
a
bunch
for
some
reason
or
other
poor
devils
they
think
this
is
some
kind
of
heaven
they
tell
me
this
is
easy
work
compared
to
the
type
they
had
to
undergo
the
satheri
like
to
get
big
bunches
through
in
one
conjuration
like
the
haul
they
made
from
the
victims
of
somebody
named
tamerlane
he
tested
a
rope
then
dropped
to
a
sitting
position
on
the
edge
of
the
block
i
let
you
stay
up
to
call
signals
from
here
only
watch
it
that
overseer
has
his
eyes
on
you
make
sure
the
ropes
stay
tight
while
we
see
if
the
thing
can
be
moved
he
started
to
slip
over
the
side
hanging
by
his
fingertips
something
caught
and
he
swore
with
one
hand
he
managed
to
free
his
breechclout
and
drag
out
the
thin
volume
that
was
lodged
between
his
groin
and
the
block
here
hold
this
for
me
until
we
meet
tonight
you
got
more
room
to
hide
it
in
your
cloth
than
i
have
he
tossed
it
over
quickly
then
dropped
from
sight
to
land
on
the
ground
below
hanson
shoved
the
book
out
of
sight
and
tried
to
act
busy
again
the
mandrake
overseer
had
started
ponderously
toward
him
but
in
a
moment
the
thing
attention
was
directed
to
some
other
object
of
torture
hanson
braced
himself
as
the
lines
of
slaves
beneath
him
settled
themselves
to
the
ropes
there
was
a
loud
cracking
of
whips
and
a
chorus
of
groans
a
small
drum
took
up
a
beat
and
the
slaves
strained
and
tugged
in
unison
ever
so
slowly
the
enormous
block
of
stone
began
to
move
while
the
ropes
drew
tighter
hanson
checked
the
rigging
with
half
his
mind
while
the
other
half
raced
in
a
crazy
circle
of
speculation
mandrakes
and
from
the
past
and
multiple
revivals
a
sky
that
fell
in
great
chunks
what
came
next
in
this
ridiculous
world
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
trapped
as
if
in
answer
to
his
question
there
was
a
sudden
coruscating
flare
from
above
hanson
body
reacted
instinctively
his
arm
came
up
over
his
eyes
cutting
off
the
glare
but
he
managed
to
squint
across
it
upwards
toward
what
was
happening
in
the
cracked
dome
for
a
split
second
he
thought
that
the
sun
had
gone
nova
he
was
wrong
but
not
by
too
much
something
had
happened
to
the
sun
now
it
was
flickering
and
flaming
shooting
enormous
jets
of
fire
from
its
rim
it
hovered
at
the
edge
of
a
great
new
hole
and
seemed
to
be
wobbling
careening
and
losing
its
balance
there
was
a
massive
shriek
of
fear
and
panic
from
the
horde
of
slaves
they
began
bellowing
like
the
collective
of
a
world
most
of
them
dropped
their
ropes
and
ran
in
blind
panic
trampling
over
each
other
in
their
random
flight
for
safety
the
human
overseers
were
part
of
the
same
riot
only
the
mandrakes
stood
stolidly
in
place
flicking
each
running
man
who
passed
them
hanson
flung
himself
face
down
on
the
stone
there
was
a
roar
of
tortured
air
from
overhead
and
a
thundering
sound
that
was
unlike
anything
except
the
tearing
of
an
infinity
of
cloth
combined
with
a
sustained
explosion
of
atomic
bombs
then
it
seemed
as
if
the
thunderbolt
of
thor
himself
had
blasted
in
hanson
ears
the
sky
had
ripped
again
and
this
time
the
entire
dome
shook
with
the
shock
but
that
was
the
worst
of
it
the
sun
had
broken
through
the
hole
and
was
falling
vii
the
fall
of
the
sun
was
seemingly
endless
it
teetered
out
of
the
hole
and
seemed
to
hover
spitting
great
gouts
of
flame
as
it
encountered
the
phlogiston
layer
slowly
agonizingly
it
picked
up
speed
and
began
its
downward
rush
unlike
the
sky
it
seemed
to
obey
the
normal
laws
of
inertia
hanson
had
known
it
swelled
bit
by
bit
raging
as
it
drew
nearer
and
it
seemed
to
be
heading
straight
for
the
pyramid
the
heat
was
already
rising
it
began
to
sear
the
skin
long
before
the
sun
struck
the
normal
atmosphere
hanson
could
feel
that
he
was
being
baked
alive
the
blood
in
his
arteries
seemed
to
bubble
and
boil
though
that
must
have
been
an
illusion
but
he
could
see
his
skin
rise
in
giant
blisters
and
heal
almost
at
once
to
blister
again
he
screamed
in
agony
and
heard
a
million
screams
around
him
then
the
other
screams
began
to
decrease
in
numbers
and
weaken
in
volume
and
he
knew
that
the
slaves
were
dying
through
a
slit
between
two
fingers
he
watched
the
ponderous
descent
the
light
was
enough
to
sear
his
retinas
but
even
they
healed
faster
than
the
damage
he
estimated
the
course
of
the
sun
amazed
to
find
that
there
was
no
panic
in
him
and
doubly
amazed
that
he
could
think
at
all
over
the
torture
that
wracked
his
body
finally
convinced
that
the
sun
would
strike
miles
to
the
south
he
rolled
across
the
scorching
surface
of
the
stone
block
and
dropped
to
the
north
side
of
it
the
shock
of
landing
must
have
broken
bones
but
a
moment
later
he
could
begin
to
breathe
again
the
heat
was
still
intense
even
behind
the
stone
block
but
it
was
bearable
at
least
for
him
pieces
were
breaking
off
the
sun
as
it
fell
and
already
striking
the
ground
one
fell
near
and
its
heat
seared
at
him
giving
him
no
place
of
shelter
then
the
sun
struck
sending
up
earth
tremors
that
knocked
him
from
his
feet
he
groped
up
and
stared
around
the
block
the
sun
had
struck
near
the
horizon
throwing
up
huge
masses
of
material
its
hissing
against
the
ground
was
a
tumult
in
his
ears
and
superheated
ash
and
debris
began
to
fall
so
far
as
he
could
see
there
were
no
other
survivors
in
the
camp
three
million
slaves
had
died
those
who
had
found
some
shelter
behind
the
stonework
had
lived
longer
than
the
others
but
that
had
only
increased
their
suffering
and
even
his
body
must
have
been
close
to
its
limits
if
it
could
be
killed
at
all
he
was
still
in
danger
if
a
salamander
could
destroy
even
such
a
body
as
his
then
the
fragments
of
sun
that
were
still
roiling
across
the
landscape
would
be
fatal
the
only
hope
he
had
was
to
get
as
far
away
from
the
place
where
the
sun
had
struck
as
he
could
he
braced
himself
to
leave
even
the
partial
shelter
there
was
a
pile
of
water
skins
near
the
base
of
the
block
held
in
the
charred
remains
of
an
attendant
body
the
water
was
boiling
but
there
was
still
some
left
he
poured
several
skins
together
and
drank
the
stuff
forcing
himself
to
endure
the
agony
of
its
passage
down
his
throat
without
it
he
be
dehydrated
before
he
could
get
a
safe
distance
away
then
he
ran
the
desert
was
like
molten
iron
under
his
bare
feet
and
the
savage
radiation
on
his
back
was
worse
than
any
overseer
whip
his
mind
threatened
to
blank
out
with
each
step
but
he
forced
himself
on
and
slowly
as
the
distance
increased
the
sun
pyre
sank
further
and
further
over
the
horizon
the
heat
should
still
have
been
enough
to
kill
any
normal
body
in
fifteen
minutes
but
he
could
endure
it
he
stumbled
on
in
a
trot
guiding
himself
by
the
stars
that
shone
in
the
broken
sky
toward
a
section
of
this
world
where
there
had
been
life
and
some
measure
of
civilization
before
after
a
few
hours
the
tongues
of
flame
no
longer
flared
above
the
horizon
though
the
brilliant
radiance
continued
and
hanson
found
that
his
strong
and
nearly
indestructible
body
still
had
limits
it
could
not
go
on
without
rest
forever
he
was
sobbing
with
fatigue
at
every
step
he
managed
to
dig
a
small
hollow
in
the
sand
before
dropping
off
to
sleep
it
was
a
sleep
of
total
exhaustion
lacking
even
a
sense
of
time
it
might
have
been
minutes
or
hours
that
he
slept
and
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
which
with
the
sun
gone
and
the
stars
rocking
into
dizzy
new
configurations
there
was
no
night
or
day
nor
any
way
to
guess
the
passage
of
time
he
woke
to
a
roaring
wind
that
sent
cutting
blasts
of
sand
driving
against
him
he
staggered
up
and
forced
himself
against
it
away
from
the
place
where
the
sun
had
fallen
even
through
the
lashing
sandstorm
he
could
see
the
glow
near
the
horizon
now
a
pillar
of
something
that
looked
like
steam
but
was
probably
vapor
from
molten
and
evaporated
rocks
was
rising
upwards
like
the
mushroom
clouds
of
his
own
days
it
was
spreading
apparently
just
under
the
phlogiston
layer
reflecting
back
the
glare
and
the
wind
was
caused
by
the
great
rising
column
of
superheated
gases
over
the
sun
he
staggered
on
while
the
sand
gave
way
slowly
to
patches
of
green
with
the
sun
gone
and
the
sky
falling
into
complete
shreds
this
world
was
certainly
doomed
he
assumed
that
the
sun
of
this
world
must
be
above
the
sky
but
he
been
wrong
like
the
other
heavenly
bodies
it
had
been
embedded
inside
the
shell
he
had
discovered
that
the
sky
material
resisted
any
sudden
stroke
but
that
other
matter
could
be
interpenetrated
into
it
as
the
stars
were
he
had
even
been
able
to
pass
his
hand
and
arm
completely
through
the
sample
apparently
the
sun
had
passed
through
the
sky
in
a
similar
manner
then
why
had
the
shell
melted
he
had
no
real
answer
the
sun
must
have
been
moving
fast
enough
so
that
no
single
spot
became
too
hot
or
else
the
phlogiston
layer
somehow
dissipated
the
heat
the
cloud
of
glowing
stuff
from
the
rising
air
column
was
spreading
out
now
reflecting
the
light
and
heat
back
to
the
earth
there
was
a
chance
that
most
of
one
hemisphere
might
retain
some
measure
of
warmth
then
at
least
there
was
still
light
enough
for
him
to
travel
safely
by
the
time
he
was
too
tired
to
go
on
again
he
had
come
to
the
beginnings
of
fertile
land
he
passed
a
village
but
it
had
been
looted
and
he
skirted
around
it
rather
than
stare
at
the
ghastly
of
the
looters
the
world
was
ending
but
civilization
seemed
to
have
ended
already
beyond
it
he
came
to
a
rude
house
now
abandoned
he
staggered
in
gratefully
for
a
change
he
had
one
piece
of
good
luck
his
first
attempt
at
magic
produced
food
at
the
sound
of
the
snapping
fingers
and
his
abracadabra
a
dirty
pot
of
hot
and
greasy
stew
came
into
existence
he
had
no
cutlery
but
his
hands
served
well
enough
when
it
was
gone
he
felt
better
he
wiped
his
hands
on
the
breechclout
whatever
the
material
in
the
cloth
it
had
stood
the
heat
almost
as
well
as
he
had
then
he
paused
as
his
hand
found
a
lump
under
the
cloth
he
drew
out
the
apprentice
magician
book
the
poor
devil
had
never
achieved
his
twenty
lifetimes
and
this
was
probably
all
that
was
left
of
him
hanson
stared
at
it
reading
the
title
in
some
surprise
he
propped
himself
up
and
began
to
scan
it
wondering
what
it
had
to
do
with
magic
he
had
a
course
of
semantics
in
college
and
could
see
no
relationship
but
he
soon
found
that
there
were
differences
this
book
began
with
the
axiomatic
statement
that
the
symbol
is
the
thing
from
that
it
developed
in
great
detail
the
fact
that
any
part
of
a
whole
bearing
similarity
to
the
whole
was
also
the
whole
that
each
seven
was
the
class
of
all
sevens
and
other
details
of
the
science
of
magical
similarity
followed
quite
logically
from
the
single
axiom
hanson
was
surprised
to
find
that
there
was
a
highly
developed
logic
to
it
once
he
accepted
the
axiom
and
he
was
no
longer
prepared
to
doubt
it
here
he
could
follow
the
book
far
better
than
he
been
able
to
follow
his
own
course
in
semantics
apparently
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
difficult
subject
from
the
constant
efforts
of
the
writer
to
make
his
point
clear
but
after
learning
to
deal
with
electron
holes
in
transistors
this
was
elementary
study
for
hanson
the
second
half
of
the
book
dealt
with
the
use
of
the
true
name
that
of
course
was
the
perfect
symbol
and
hence
the
true
whole
there
was
the
simple
ritual
of
giving
a
secret
name
apparently
any
man
who
discovered
a
principle
or
device
could
use
a
name
for
it
just
as
parents
could
give
one
to
their
children
and
there
were
the
laws
for
using
the
name
unfortunately
just
when
hanson
was
beginning
to
make
some
sense
of
it
the
book
ended
obviously
there
was
a
lot
more
to
be
covered
in
later
courses
he
tossed
the
book
aside
shivering
as
he
realized
that
his
secret
name
was
common
knowledge
the
wonder
was
that
he
could
exist
at
all
and
while
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
ritual
for
relinquishing
one
name
and
taking
another
that
was
one
of
the
higher
mysteries
not
given
in
the
morning
he
stopped
to
magic
up
some
more
food
and
the
clothing
he
would
need
if
he
ever
found
the
trace
of
civilized
people
again
the
food
was
edible
though
he
never
particularly
liked
cereal
he
seemed
to
be
getting
the
hang
of
abracadabraing
up
what
was
in
his
mind
but
the
clothing
was
a
problem
everything
he
got
turned
out
to
be
the
right
size
but
he
could
see
himself
in
hauberk
and
greaves
nor
in
a
filmy
nightgown
finally
he
managed
something
that
was
adequate
if
the
brilliant
floral
sportshirt
could
be
said
to
go
with
levi
pants
and
a
morning
frock
but
he
felt
somewhat
better
in
it
he
finally
left
the
frock
behind
however
it
was
still
too
hot
for
that
he
walked
on
briskly
watching
for
signs
of
life
and
speculating
on
the
principles
of
applied
semantics
name
magic
and
similarity
he
could
begin
to
understand
how
an
einstein
might
read
through
one
of
the
advanced
books
here
and
make
leaps
in
theory
beyond
what
the
satheri
had
developed
they
had
it
too
easy
magic
that
worked
tended
to
overcome
the
drive
for
the
discipline
needed
to
get
the
most
out
of
it
any
good
theoretician
from
hanson
world
could
probably
make
fools
of
these
people
maybe
that
was
why
the
satheri
had
gone
scrounging
back
through
other
worlds
to
find
men
who
had
the
necessary
drive
to
get
things
done
when
the
going
was
tough
twice
he
passed
abandoned
villages
but
there
was
nothing
there
for
him
he
was
coming
toward
forested
ground
now
something
like
the
country
in
which
the
sons
of
the
egg
had
found
refuge
the
thought
of
that
made
him
go
slower
but
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
further
sign
of
life
the
woods
thinned
out
to
grasslands
and
he
went
on
for
hours
more
before
he
spotted
a
cluster
of
lights
ahead
as
he
drew
nearer
he
saw
that
the
lights
seemed
to
be
fluorescents
they
were
coming
from
corrugated
iron
sheds
that
looked
like
aircraft
hangars
strung
together
there
was
a
fence
around
the
structures
and
a
sign
that
said
simply
in
the
from
the
sky
he
could
see
a
lawn
and
there
were
a
few
groups
of
men
standing
about
idly
most
wore
white
coveralls
though
two
were
dressed
in
simple
business
suits
hanson
moved
forward
purposefully
acting
as
if
he
had
urgent
business
if
he
stopped
there
would
be
questions
he
suspected
he
wanted
to
find
answers
not
to
answer
idle
questions
there
was
no
one
at
the
desk
in
the
little
reception
alcove
but
he
heard
the
sound
of
voices
through
a
side
door
leading
out
he
went
through
it
to
find
a
larger
yard
with
more
men
idling
there
should
be
someone
here
who
knew
more
of
what
was
going
on
in
this
world
than
he
did
now
his
choice
in
the
long
run
seemed
to
lie
between
bork
and
the
satheri
unless
he
could
find
some
way
of
hiding
himself
from
both
sides
at
the
moment
he
was
relatively
free
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
brought
him
here
and
he
wanted
to
make
sure
that
he
could
make
the
most
use
of
the
fact
nobody
asked
anything
he
slowed
drifting
along
the
perimeter
of
the
group
of
men
and
still
nobody
paid
him
any
attention
finally
he
dropped
onto
the
ground
near
a
group
of
half
a
dozen
men
who
looked
more
alert
than
the
rest
they
seemed
to
be
reminiscing
over
old
two
an
hour
with
overtime
and
double
time
for
the
swing
shift
we
really
had
it
made
then
and
every
saturday
never
fail
the
general
would
come
out
from
muroc
and
tell
us
we
were
the
heros
of
the
home
front
with
overtime
pay
while
we
listened
to
him
yeah
but
what
if
you
wanted
to
quit
suppose
you
did
like
your
shift
boss
or
somebody
you
go
down
and
get
your
time
and
they
hand
you
your
draft
notice
me
i
liked
it
better
in
not
so
much
pay
but
hanson
pricked
up
his
ears
the
conversation
told
him
more
than
he
needed
to
know
he
stood
up
and
peered
through
the
windows
of
the
shed
there
unattended
under
banks
of
lights
stood
aircraft
shapes
he
would
get
much
information
here
it
seemed
these
were
obviously
reanimates
men
who
been
pulled
from
his
own
world
and
set
to
work
they
could
do
their
duties
and
their
memories
were
complete
but
they
were
lacking
some
essential
thing
that
had
gone
out
of
them
before
they
were
brought
here
unless
he
could
find
one
among
them
who
was
either
a
housing
a
soul
or
one
of
the
few
reanimates
who
seemed
almost
fully
human
he
get
little
information
but
he
was
curious
as
to
what
the
satheri
had
expected
to
do
with
aircraft
the
rocs
had
better
range
and
altitude
than
any
planes
of
equal
hauling
power
he
located
one
man
who
seemed
a
little
brighter
than
the
others
the
fellow
was
lying
on
the
ground
staring
at
the
sky
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
from
time
to
time
he
frowned
as
if
the
sight
of
the
sky
was
making
him
wonder
the
man
nodded
as
hanson
dropped
down
beside
him
hi
just
get
here
mac
yeah
hanson
assented
what
the
score
the
man
sat
up
and
made
a
disgusted
noise
who
knows
he
answered
there
was
more
emotion
in
his
voice
than
might
be
expected
from
a
reanimate
in
real
life
on
his
own
world
he
must
have
had
an
amazing
potential
for
even
that
much
to
carry
over
we
dead
we
dead
and
we
here
and
they
tell
us
to
make
helicopters
so
we
make
them
working
like
dogs
to
make
a
deadline
then
just
as
the
first
one
comes
off
the
line
the
power
fails
no
more
juice
the
head
engineer
took
off
in
the
one
we
finished
he
was
going
to
find
out
what
gives
but
he
never
came
back
so
we
sit
he
spat
on
the
ground
i
wish
they
left
me
dead
after
the
plant
blew
up
i
not
myself
since
then
what
in
hell
would
they
need
with
helicopters
hanson
asked
the
man
shrugged
beats
me
but
i
beginning
to
figure
some
things
out
they
got
some
kind
of
trouble
with
the
sky
i
figure
they
got
confused
in
bringing
us
here
this
shop
is
one
that
made
those
big
cargo
copters
they
call
hooks
and
maybe
they
thought
the
things
were
just
what
they
called
all
i
know
is
they
kept
us
working
five
solid
weeks
for
nothing
i
knew
the
power
was
going
to
fail
they
had
the
craziest
damn
generating
plant
you
ever
saw
and
it
could
last
the
boilers
kept
sizzling
and
popping
their
safety
valves
with
no
fire
in
the
box
just
some
little
old
man
sitting
in
a
corner
practicing
the
masonic
grip
or
something
over
a
smudgepot
hanson
gestured
back
to
the
sheds
if
there
no
power
what
are
those
lights
witch
lights
they
told
us
the
man
explained
saved
a
lot
of
wiring
or
something
they
hey
what
that
he
was
looking
up
and
hanson
followed
his
gaze
there
was
something
whizzing
overhead
at
speed
a
piece
of
the
sky
falling
he
said
the
man
snorted
falling
sidewise
not
likely
even
here
i
tell
you
pal
i
do
like
this
place
nothing
works
right
there
was
no
fuel
for
the
we
finished
the
one
we
called
betsy
ann
but
the
little
geezer
who
worked
the
smudgepot
just
walked
up
to
it
and
wiggled
his
finger
your
motor
going
betsy
ann
he
ordered
with
some
other
then
the
motor
roared
and
he
and
the
engineer
took
off
at
double
the
speed
she
could
make
on
gas
hey
there
it
is
again
does
look
like
the
betsy
ann
coming
back
either
the
something
whizzed
by
again
in
the
other
direction
but
lower
and
slower
it
made
a
gigantic
but
erratic
circle
beyond
the
sheds
and
swooped
back
it
looked
nothing
like
a
helicopter
it
looked
like
a
decoration
of
a
woman
on
a
broomstick
as
it
came
nearer
hanson
saw
that
it
a
woman
on
a
broomstick
flying
erratically
she
straightened
out
in
a
flat
glide
she
came
in
for
a
landing
a
couple
of
yards
away
the
tip
of
the
broom
handle
hit
the
ground
and
she
went
sailing
over
it
to
land
on
her
hands
and
knees
she
got
up
facing
the
shed
the
woman
was
nema
her
face
was
masklike
her
eyes
tortured
she
was
staring
searchingly
around
her
looking
at
every
man
nema
hanson
cried
she
spun
to
face
him
and
gasped
her
skin
seemed
to
turn
gray
and
her
eyes
opened
to
double
their
normal
size
she
took
one
tottering
step
toward
him
and
halted
illusion
she
whispered
hoarsely
and
slumped
to
the
ground
in
a
faint
she
was
reviving
before
he
could
raise
her
from
the
ground
she
swayed
a
moment
staring
at
him
you
not
dead
what
so
wonderful
about
that
around
here
he
asked
but
not
with
much
interest
with
the
world
going
to
pot
and
only
a
few
days
left
the
girl
face
and
the
slim
young
body
under
it
were
about
all
the
reality
left
worth
thinking
about
he
grabbed
for
her
pulling
her
to
him
bertha
had
never
made
him
feel
like
that
she
managed
to
avoid
his
lips
and
slid
away
from
him
but
they
used
the
dave
hanson
you
never
died
it
was
only
induced
illusion
by
that
that
bork
and
to
think
that
i
nearly
died
of
grief
while
you
were
enjoying
yourself
here
you
you
he
grunted
he
almost
managed
to
forget
what
he
was
and
he
enjoy
having
the
aircraft
worker
find
out
he
turned
to
see
what
the
reaction
was
and
then
stared
at
his
surroundings
there
were
no
lights
from
the
plane
factory
in
fact
there
was
no
plane
factory
in
the
of
the
sky
he
saw
that
the
plant
was
gone
no
men
were
left
there
was
only
barren
earth
with
a
tiny
limp
sapling
in
the
middle
of
empty
acres
what
happened
nema
glanced
around
briefly
and
sighed
it
happening
all
over
they
created
the
plane
plant
by
the
law
of
identities
from
that
little
plane
tree
sapling
i
suppose
it
is
a
plane
plant
after
all
but
with
the
conjunctions
and
signs
failing
all
such
creations
are
returning
to
their
original
form
unless
a
spell
is
used
continually
over
them
even
then
sometimes
we
fail
most
of
the
projects
vanished
after
the
sun
fell
hanson
remembered
the
man
with
whom
he
been
talking
before
nema
appeared
he
have
liked
to
know
such
a
man
before
death
and
revivification
had
ruined
him
it
was
fair
that
anyone
with
character
enough
to
be
that
human
even
as
a
zombie
should
be
wiped
out
without
even
a
moment
consideration
then
he
remembered
the
man
own
estimate
of
his
current
situation
maybe
he
was
better
off
returned
to
the
death
that
had
claimed
him
reluctantly
he
returned
to
his
own
problems
all
right
then
if
you
thought
i
was
dead
what
are
you
doing
here
nema
i
felt
the
compulsion
begin
even
before
i
returned
to
the
city
i
thought
i
was
going
mad
i
tried
to
forget
you
but
the
compulsion
grew
until
i
could
fight
it
no
longer
she
shuddered
it
was
a
terrible
flight
the
carpets
will
not
work
at
all
now
and
i
could
hardly
control
the
broom
sometimes
it
would
lift
twice
it
sailed
so
high
i
could
hardly
breathe
and
i
had
no
hope
of
finding
you
yet
i
went
on
been
flying
when
i
could
for
three
days
now
bork
of
course
had
known
of
her
spell
with
which
she
forced
herself
to
want
him
well
and
truly
apparently
it
had
gone
on
operating
even
when
she
thought
he
was
dead
and
with
a
sense
of
his
direction
well
she
was
here
and
he
was
sorry
hanson
took
another
look
across
the
plains
toward
the
glowing
hell
of
the
horizon
he
reached
for
her
and
pulled
her
to
him
she
was
firm
and
sweet
against
him
and
she
was
trembling
in
response
to
his
urging
at
the
last
moment
she
pulled
back
you
forget
yourself
dave
hanson
i
a
registered
and
certified
virgin
my
blood
is
needed
for
for
spells
that
wo
work
anyhow
he
told
her
harshly
the
sky
falling
now
kid
it
down
or
most
of
it
but
she
hesitated
and
then
let
herself
come
a
trifle
closer
her
voice
was
doubtful
it
true
that
our
spells
are
failing
not
even
the
surest
magic
is
reliable
the
world
has
gone
mad
and
even
magic
is
no
longer
trustworthy
but
he
was
just
pulling
her
close
enough
again
and
feeling
her
arms
lift
to
his
neck
when
the
ground
shook
behind
them
and
there
was
a
sound
of
great
jarring
thudding
steps
hanson
jerked
around
to
see
a
great
roc
making
its
landing
run
heading
straight
for
them
the
huge
bird
braked
savagely
barely
stopping
before
they
were
under
its
feet
from
its
back
a
ladder
of
some
flexible
material
snaked
down
and
men
began
descending
the
first
were
mandrakes
in
the
uniform
of
the
satheri
all
carrying
weapons
with
blades
or
sharp
stickers
the
last
man
off
was
bork
he
came
toward
hanson
and
nema
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
greetings
dave
hanson
you
do
manage
to
survive
do
you
and
my
little
virgin
sister
without
whose
flight
i
might
not
have
found
you
well
come
along
the
roc
growing
impatient
viii
the
great
roc
wings
set
up
a
constant
sound
of
rushing
air
and
the
distance
flowed
behind
them
there
was
the
rush
of
wind
all
around
them
but
on
the
bird
back
they
were
in
an
area
where
everything
seemed
calm
only
when
hanson
looked
over
toward
the
ground
was
he
fully
conscious
of
the
speed
they
were
making
from
the
height
he
could
see
where
the
sun
had
landed
it
was
sinking
slowly
into
the
earth
lying
in
a
great
fused
hole
for
miles
around
smaller
drops
of
the
sun
had
spattered
and
were
etching
deeper
holes
in
the
pitted
landscape
then
they
began
passing
over
desolate
country
scoured
by
winds
gloomy
from
the
angry
glaring
clouds
above
once
two
bodies
went
hurtling
upwards
toward
the
great
gaps
in
the
sky
those
risings
were
from
men
who
were
no
worshippers
of
the
hatching
bork
commented
it
spreading
something
is
drawing
them
up
from
all
over
the
planet
later
half
a
square
mile
of
the
shell
cracked
off
the
roc
squawked
harshly
but
it
had
learned
and
had
been
watching
above
by
a
frantic
effort
of
the
great
wings
it
missed
the
hurtling
chunk
they
dropped
a
few
thousand
feet
in
the
winds
that
followed
the
piece
of
sky
but
their
altitude
was
still
safe
then
they
passed
over
a
town
flying
low
the
sights
below
were
out
of
a
ghoul
bacchanalia
as
the
roc
swept
over
the
people
stopped
their
frenzied
pursuit
of
sensation
and
ran
for
weapons
a
cloud
of
arrows
hissed
upwards
all
fortunately
too
late
they
blame
all
their
troubles
on
the
magicians
bork
explained
they
been
shooting
at
everything
that
flies
not
a
happy
time
to
associate
with
the
satheri
is
it
nema
drew
further
back
from
him
we
not
all
cowards
like
you
only
rats
desert
a
sinking
ship
nobody
thought
it
was
sinking
when
i
deserted
bork
reminded
her
anyhow
if
you
been
using
your
eyes
and
seen
the
way
we
are
traveling
you
know
i
rejoined
the
crew
i
made
up
with
the
sather
karf
and
at
a
time
like
this
our
great
grandfather
was
glad
to
have
me
back
nema
rushed
toward
him
in
delight
but
hanson
was
convinced
why
he
asked
bork
sobered
one
of
the
corpses
that
fell
back
from
the
risings
added
a
word
to
what
the
others
had
said
no
i
bear
the
weight
of
it
myself
and
not
burden
you
with
it
but
i
convinced
now
that
his
egg
should
not
hatch
i
had
doubts
before
unlike
our
friend
malok
who
also
heard
the
words
but
is
doubly
the
fanatic
now
perhaps
the
hatching
can
not
be
stopped
but
i
decided
that
i
am
a
man
and
must
fight
like
one
against
the
fates
so
though
i
still
oppose
much
that
the
satheri
have
done
i
gone
back
to
them
we
be
at
the
camp
of
the
sather
karf
shortly
that
sewed
everything
up
neatly
hanson
thought
before
he
had
been
torn
between
two
alternatives
now
there
was
only
one
and
he
had
no
choice
he
could
never
trust
the
sons
of
the
egg
with
bork
turned
against
them
he
stared
up
at
the
sky
realizing
that
more
than
half
of
it
had
already
fallen
the
rest
seemed
too
weak
to
last
much
longer
it
probably
did
make
much
difference
what
he
did
now
or
who
had
him
time
was
running
out
for
this
world
the
light
was
dimmer
by
the
time
they
reached
the
great
capital
city
or
what
was
left
of
it
they
had
left
the
sun
pyre
far
to
the
south
the
air
was
growing
cold
already
the
roc
flew
low
over
the
city
the
few
people
on
the
streets
looked
up
and
made
threatening
gestures
but
there
was
no
flight
of
arrows
from
the
ground
probably
the
men
below
had
lost
even
the
strength
to
hate
it
was
hard
to
see
since
there
was
no
electric
lighting
system
now
but
it
seemed
to
hanson
that
only
the
oldest
and
ugliest
buildings
were
still
standing
honest
stone
and
metal
could
survive
but
the
work
of
magic
was
no
longer
safe
one
of
the
remaining
buildings
seemed
to
be
a
hospital
and
the
empty
space
in
front
of
it
was
crammed
with
people
most
of
them
seemed
to
be
dead
or
unconscious
squat
mandrakes
were
carrying
off
bodies
toward
a
great
fire
that
was
burning
in
another
square
plague
and
pestilence
had
apparently
gotten
out
of
hand
they
flew
on
beyond
the
city
toward
the
construction
camp
that
had
been
hanson
headquarters
the
roc
was
beginning
to
drop
into
a
long
landing
glide
and
details
below
were
easier
to
see
along
the
beach
beyond
the
city
a
crowd
had
collected
they
had
a
fire
going
and
were
preparing
to
cook
one
of
the
mermaids
a
fight
was
already
going
on
over
the
prey
food
must
have
been
exhausted
days
before
the
camp
was
a
mess
when
they
reached
it
one
section
had
been
ripped
down
by
the
lash
of
wind
from
a
huge
piece
of
the
sky
which
now
lay
among
the
ruins
with
a
few
stars
glowing
inside
it
there
was
a
brighter
glow
beyond
apparently
one
blob
of
material
from
the
sun
had
been
tossed
all
the
way
here
and
had
landed
against
a
huge
rock
to
spatter
into
fragments
the
heat
from
those
fragments
cut
through
the
chill
in
the
air
and
the
glow
furnished
light
for
most
of
the
camp
the
tents
had
been
burned
but
there
was
a
new
building
where
the
main
tent
had
been
this
was
obviously
a
hasty
construction
job
thrown
together
of
rocks
and
tree
trunks
without
the
use
of
magic
it
was
more
of
an
enormous
than
a
true
building
but
it
was
the
best
protection
now
available
hanson
could
see
sather
karf
and
sersa
garm
waiting
outside
together
with
less
than
a
hundred
other
warlocks
the
mandrakes
prodded
hanson
down
from
the
roc
and
toward
the
new
building
then
left
at
a
wave
of
the
sather
karf
hand
the
old
man
stared
at
hanson
intently
but
his
expression
was
unreadable
he
seemed
to
have
aged
a
thousand
years
finally
he
lifted
his
hand
in
faint
greeting
sighed
and
dropped
slowly
to
a
seat
his
face
seemed
to
collapse
with
the
iron
running
out
of
it
he
looked
like
a
beaten
sick
old
man
his
voice
was
toneless
fix
the
sky
dave
hanson
there
were
angry
murmurs
from
other
warlocks
in
the
background
but
sather
karf
shook
his
head
slowly
still
facing
hanson
no
what
good
to
threaten
dire
punishments
or
to
torture
you
when
another
day
or
week
will
see
the
end
of
everything
what
good
to
demand
your
reasons
for
desertion
when
time
is
so
short
fix
the
sky
and
claim
what
reward
you
will
afterwards
we
have
few
powers
now
that
the
basis
of
astrology
is
ruined
but
repair
our
sky
and
we
can
reward
you
beyond
your
dreams
we
can
find
ways
to
return
you
to
your
own
world
intact
you
have
near
immortality
now
we
can
fill
that
entire
lifetime
with
pleasures
give
you
jewels
to
buy
an
empire
or
if
it
is
vengeance
against
whatever
you
feel
we
are
you
shall
know
my
secret
name
and
the
name
of
everyone
here
do
with
us
then
what
you
like
fix
the
sky
it
shook
hanson
he
had
been
prepared
to
face
fury
or
to
try
lying
his
way
out
if
there
was
a
chance
with
some
story
of
having
needed
to
study
menes
methods
or
of
being
lost
but
he
had
no
defense
prepared
against
such
an
appeal
it
was
utterly
mad
he
could
do
nothing
and
their
demands
were
impossible
but
before
the
picture
of
the
world
dying
and
the
decay
of
the
old
sather
pride
even
hanson
own
probable
death
with
the
dying
world
seemed
unimportant
he
might
at
least
give
them
something
to
hope
for
while
the
end
came
maybe
he
said
slowly
maybe
if
all
of
the
men
you
brought
here
to
work
on
the
problem
were
to
pool
their
knowledge
we
might
still
find
the
answer
how
long
will
it
take
to
get
them
here
for
a
council
ser
perth
appeared
from
the
group
hanson
had
thought
the
man
dead
in
the
ruins
of
the
pyramid
but
somehow
he
had
survived
the
fat
was
going
from
his
face
and
his
mustache
was
untrimmed
but
he
was
uninjured
he
shook
his
head
sadly
most
have
disappeared
with
their
projects
two
escaped
us
menes
is
dead
cagliostro
tricked
us
successfully
you
are
all
we
have
left
and
we
ca
even
supply
labor
beyond
those
you
see
here
the
people
no
longer
obey
us
since
we
have
no
food
to
give
them
you
the
only
hope
bork
agreed
they
saved
what
they
could
of
the
tools
from
the
camp
and
what
magical
instruments
are
still
useful
they
held
on
only
for
your
return
hanson
stared
at
them
and
around
at
the
collection
of
and
machinery
they
had
assembled
for
him
he
opened
his
mouth
and
his
laughter
was
a
mockery
of
their
hopes
and
of
himself
dave
hanson
world
saver
you
got
the
right
name
but
the
wrong
man
sather
karf
he
said
bitterly
he
been
a
pretender
long
enough
and
what
punitive
action
they
took
now
did
seem
to
matter
you
wanted
my
uncle
david
arnold
hanson
but
because
his
friends
called
him
dave
and
cut
that
name
on
his
monument
and
because
i
was
christened
by
the
name
you
called
you
got
me
instead
he
have
been
helpless
here
probably
but
with
me
you
have
no
chance
i
could
even
build
a
doghouse
i
was
even
a
construction
engineer
just
a
computer
operator
and
repairman
he
regretted
ruining
their
hopes
almost
as
he
said
it
but
he
could
see
no
change
on
the
old
sather
face
it
seemed
to
stiffen
slightly
and
become
more
thoughtful
but
there
was
no
disappointment
my
grandson
bork
told
me
all
that
he
said
yet
your
name
was
on
the
monument
and
we
drew
you
back
by
its
use
our
ancient
prophecy
declared
that
we
should
find
omnipotence
carved
on
stone
in
a
pool
of
water
as
we
found
your
name
therefore
by
the
laws
of
rational
magic
it
is
to
whom
nothing
is
impossible
we
may
have
mistaken
the
direction
of
your
talent
but
nonetheless
it
is
you
who
must
fix
the
sky
what
form
of
wonder
is
a
computer
dave
shook
his
head
at
the
old
man
monomania
just
a
tool
it
a
little
hard
to
explain
and
it
could
help
humor
my
curiosity
then
what
is
a
computer
dave
hanson
nema
hand
rested
on
hanson
arm
pleadingly
and
he
shrugged
he
groped
about
for
some
answer
that
could
be
phrased
in
their
language
letting
his
mind
flicker
from
the
modern
electronic
gadgets
back
to
the
tide
predicter
an
analogue
computer
is
a
machine
that
that
sets
up
conditions
mathematically
similar
to
the
conditions
in
some
problem
and
then
lets
all
the
operations
proceed
while
it
draws
a
graph
a
prediction
of
how
the
real
conditions
would
turn
out
if
the
tides
change
with
the
position
of
some
heavenly
body
then
we
can
build
cams
that
have
shapes
like
the
effect
of
the
moon
orbit
and
gear
them
together
in
the
right
order
if
there
are
many
factors
we
have
a
cam
for
each
factor
shaped
like
the
periodic
rise
and
fall
of
that
factor
they
all
geared
to
let
the
various
factors
operate
at
the
proper
relative
rate
with
such
a
machine
we
can
run
off
a
graph
of
the
tides
for
years
ahead
oh
hell
it
a
lot
more
complicated
than
that
but
it
takes
the
basic
facts
and
draws
a
picture
of
the
results
we
use
electronic
ones
now
but
the
results
are
the
same
i
understand
sather
karf
said
dave
doubted
it
but
he
was
happy
to
be
saved
from
struggling
with
a
more
detailed
explanation
and
maybe
the
old
man
did
understand
some
of
it
he
was
no
fool
in
his
own
subject
certainly
sather
karf
pondered
for
a
moment
and
then
nodded
with
apparent
satisfaction
your
world
was
more
advanced
in
understanding
than
i
had
thought
this
computer
is
a
fine
scientific
instrument
obeying
natural
law
well
we
have
applied
the
same
methods
though
less
elaborately
but
the
basic
magical
principle
of
similarity
is
the
foundation
of
true
science
dave
started
to
protest
and
then
stopped
frowning
in
a
way
what
the
other
had
said
was
true
maybe
there
was
some
relation
between
science
and
magic
after
all
there
might
even
be
a
meeting
ground
between
the
laws
of
the
two
worlds
he
knew
computers
set
up
similar
conditions
with
the
idea
that
the
results
would
apply
to
the
original
magic
used
some
symbolic
part
of
a
thing
in
manipulations
that
were
to
be
effective
for
the
real
thing
the
essential
difference
was
that
science
was
predictive
and
magic
was
effective
though
the
end
results
were
often
the
same
on
dave
world
the
cardinal
rule
of
logic
was
that
the
symbol
was
not
the
thing
and
work
done
on
symbols
had
to
be
translated
by
hard
work
into
reality
maybe
things
were
really
more
logical
here
where
the
symbol
was
the
thing
and
all
the
steps
in
between
thought
and
result
were
saved
so
we
are
all
at
fault
sather
karf
said
finally
we
should
have
studied
you
more
deeply
and
you
should
have
been
more
honest
with
us
then
we
could
have
obtained
a
computer
for
you
and
you
could
have
simulated
our
sky
as
it
should
be
within
your
computer
and
forced
it
to
be
repaired
long
ago
but
there
no
time
for
regrets
now
we
can
not
help
you
so
you
must
help
yourself
build
a
computer
dave
hanson
it
impossible
sudden
rage
burned
on
the
old
man
face
and
he
came
to
his
feet
his
arm
jerked
back
and
snapped
forward
nothing
happened
he
grimaced
at
the
ruined
sky
dave
hanson
he
cried
sharply
by
the
unfailing
power
of
your
name
which
is
all
of
you
i
hold
you
in
my
mind
and
your
throat
is
in
my
hand
the
old
hands
squeezed
suddenly
and
hanson
felt
a
vise
clamp
down
around
his
throat
he
tried
to
break
free
but
there
was
no
escape
the
old
man
mumbled
and
the
vise
was
gone
but
something
clawed
at
liver
something
else
rasped
across
his
sciatic
nerve
his
kidneys
seemed
to
be
wrenched
out
of
him
you
will
build
a
computer
sather
karf
ordered
and
you
save
our
world
hanson
staggered
from
the
shock
of
the
pain
but
he
was
no
longer
unused
to
agony
he
had
spent
too
many
hours
under
the
baking
of
the
sun
the
agony
of
the
and
the
lash
of
an
overseer
whip
the
agony
could
not
be
stopped
but
he
learned
it
could
be
endured
his
fantastic
body
could
heal
itself
against
whatever
they
did
to
him
and
his
mind
refused
to
accept
the
torture
supinely
he
took
a
step
toward
sather
karf
and
another
his
hands
came
up
as
he
moved
forward
bork
laughed
suddenly
let
up
sather
karf
or
you
regret
it
by
the
laws
you
dealing
with
a
this
time
let
up
or
i
free
him
to
meet
you
fairly
the
old
man
eyes
blazed
hotly
then
he
sighed
and
relaxed
the
clutching
hands
and
the
pain
were
gone
from
hanson
as
the
sather
karf
slumped
back
wearily
to
his
seat
fix
our
sky
the
old
man
said
woodenly
hanson
staggered
back
panting
from
his
efforts
but
he
nodded
all
right
he
agreed
like
bork
i
think
a
man
has
to
fight
against
his
fate
no
matter
how
little
chance
he
has
i
do
what
i
can
i
build
the
damned
computer
but
when
i
finished
i
wait
for
true
name
suddenly
sather
karf
laughed
well
said
dave
hanson
you
have
my
name
when
the
time
comes
and
whatever
else
you
desire
also
what
poor
help
we
can
give
you
now
ser
perth
bring
food
for
dave
hanson
ser
perth
shook
his
head
sadly
there
is
none
none
at
all
we
hoped
that
the
remaining
planets
would
find
a
favorable
conjunction
but
dave
hanson
studied
his
helpers
with
more
bitterness
oh
hell
he
said
at
last
he
snapped
his
fingers
abracadabra
his
skill
must
be
improving
since
he
got
exactly
what
he
had
wished
for
a
full
side
of
beef
materialized
against
his
palm
almost
breaking
his
arm
before
he
could
snap
it
out
of
the
way
the
others
swarmed
hungrily
toward
it
at
their
expressions
of
wonder
hanson
felt
more
confidence
returning
to
him
he
concentrated
and
went
through
the
little
ritual
again
this
time
loaves
of
bread
rained
down
fresh
bread
and
even
of
the
brand
he
had
wished
for
maybe
he
was
becoming
a
magician
himself
with
a
new
magic
that
might
still
accomplish
something
sather
karf
smiled
approvingly
the
theory
of
resonance
i
see
unreliable
generally
more
of
an
art
than
a
science
but
you
show
promise
of
remarkable
natural
ability
to
apply
it
you
know
about
it
dave
had
assumed
that
it
was
completely
outside
their
experience
and
procedures
we
it
but
when
more
advanced
techniques
took
over
most
of
us
forgot
it
the
syllables
resonate
in
a
sound
pattern
with
your
world
to
which
you
also
still
resonate
it
wo
work
for
you
with
anything
from
this
world
nor
will
anything
work
thus
for
us
from
yours
we
had
different
syllables
of
course
for
use
here
sather
karf
considered
it
but
if
you
can
control
it
and
bring
in
one
of
your
computers
or
the
parts
for
one
sixteen
tries
later
dave
was
cursing
as
he
stared
at
a
pile
of
useless
items
he
gotten
transistors
at
first
then
he
lost
control
with
too
much
tension
or
fatigue
and
began
getting
a
bunch
of
assorted
junk
such
as
old
tubes
a
transit
a
crystal
vase
and
resistors
but
the
chief
trouble
was
that
he
could
secure
working
batteries
he
had
managed
a
few
but
all
were
dead
like
the
soul
electrical
charges
will
not
transfer
sather
karf
agreed
sadly
i
should
have
told
you
that
there
was
no
electricity
here
with
which
to
power
anything
and
their
spells
could
not
be
made
to
work
now
even
if
he
could
build
a
computer
out
of
what
was
obtainable
there
would
be
no
way
to
power
it
overhead
the
sky
shattered
with
a
roar
and
another
piece
fell
tearing
downwards
toward
the
city
sersa
garm
stared
upwards
in
horror
mars
he
croaked
mars
has
fallen
now
can
there
be
no
conjunction
ever
he
tautened
and
his
body
rose
slowly
from
the
ground
a
scream
ripped
from
his
lips
and
faded
away
as
he
began
rushing
upwards
with
increasing
speed
he
passed
but
of
their
sight
straight
toward
the
new
hole
in
the
sky
ix
in
the
hours
that
followed
dave
vague
plans
changed
a
dozen
times
as
he
found
each
idea
unworkable
his
emotional
balance
was
also
erratic
though
that
was
natural
since
the
stars
were
completely
berserk
in
what
was
left
of
the
sky
he
seemed
to
fluctuate
between
bitter
sureness
of
doom
and
a
stupidly
optimistic
belief
that
something
could
be
done
to
avert
that
doom
but
whatever
his
mood
he
went
on
working
and
scheming
furiously
maybe
it
was
the
desperate
need
to
keep
himself
occupied
that
drove
him
or
perhaps
it
was
the
pleading
he
saw
in
the
eyes
around
him
in
the
end
determination
conquered
his
pessimism
somewhere
in
the
combination
of
the
science
he
had
learned
in
his
own
world
and
the
technique
of
magic
that
applied
here
there
had
to
be
an
answer
or
a
means
to
hold
back
the
end
of
the
world
until
an
answer
could
be
found
the
biggest
problem
was
the
number
of
factors
with
which
he
had
to
deal
there
were
seven
planets
and
the
sun
and
three
thousand
fixed
stars
all
had
to
be
ordered
in
their
courses
and
the
sky
had
to
be
complete
in
his
calculations
he
had
learned
his
trade
where
the
answer
was
always
to
add
one
more
circuit
in
increasing
complexity
now
he
had
to
think
of
the
simplest
possible
similarity
computer
electronics
was
out
obviously
he
tried
to
design
a
set
of
cams
like
the
tide
machine
to
make
multiple
tracings
on
paper
similar
to
a
continuous
horoscope
but
finally
gave
it
up
they
could
build
the
parts
even
if
there
had
been
time
he
had
to
depend
on
what
was
available
since
magic
could
produce
any
needed
device
and
since
the
people
here
had
depended
on
magic
too
long
to
develop
the
other
necessary
skills
when
only
the
broadest
powers
of
magic
remained
they
were
hopeless
names
were
still
potent
resonance
worked
within
its
limits
and
the
general
principles
of
similarity
still
applied
but
those
were
not
enough
for
them
they
depended
too
heavily
on
the
second
great
principle
of
contagion
and
that
seemed
to
be
wrapped
up
with
some
kind
of
association
through
the
signs
and
houses
and
the
courses
of
the
planets
he
found
himself
thinking
in
circles
of
worry
and
pulled
himself
back
to
his
problem
normally
a
computer
was
designed
for
flexibility
and
to
handle
varying
conditions
this
one
could
be
designed
to
handle
only
one
set
of
factors
it
had
to
duplicate
the
courses
of
the
objects
in
their
sky
and
simulate
the
general
behavior
of
the
dome
it
was
not
necessary
to
allow
for
all
theoretical
courses
but
only
for
the
normal
orbits
and
finally
he
realized
that
he
was
thinking
of
a
model
the
one
thing
which
is
functionally
the
perfect
analogue
it
brought
him
back
to
magic
again
make
a
doll
like
a
man
and
stick
pins
in
it
and
the
man
dies
make
a
model
of
the
universe
within
the
sky
and
any
changes
in
that
should
change
reality
the
symbol
was
the
thing
and
a
model
was
obviously
a
symbol
he
began
trying
to
plan
a
model
with
three
thousand
stars
in
their
orbits
trying
to
find
some
simple
way
of
moving
them
the
others
watched
in
fascination
they
apparently
felt
that
the
diagrams
he
was
drawing
were
some
kind
of
scientific
spell
ser
perth
was
closer
than
the
others
studying
the
marks
he
made
the
man
suddenly
pointed
to
his
computations
over
and
over
i
find
the
figure
seven
and
the
figure
three
thousand
i
assume
that
the
seven
represents
the
planets
but
what
is
the
other
figure
the
stars
hanson
told
him
impatiently
ser
perth
shook
his
head
that
is
wrong
there
were
only
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
before
the
beginnings
of
our
trouble
and
i
suppose
you
got
the
exact
orbits
of
every
one
hanson
asked
he
could
see
that
the
difference
was
going
to
help
much
naturally
they
are
fixed
stars
which
means
they
move
with
the
sky
otherwise
why
call
them
fixed
stars
only
the
sun
and
the
planets
move
through
the
sky
the
stars
move
with
the
sky
over
the
world
as
a
unity
dave
grunted
at
his
own
stupidity
that
really
simplified
things
since
it
meant
only
one
control
for
all
of
them
and
the
sky
itself
but
designing
a
machine
to
handle
the
planets
and
the
sun
while
a
lot
simpler
was
still
a
complex
problem
with
time
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
but
there
was
no
time
for
trial
and
error
he
ripped
up
his
plans
and
began
a
new
set
he
need
a
glass
sphere
with
dots
on
it
for
the
stars
and
some
kind
of
levers
to
move
the
planets
and
sun
it
would
be
something
like
the
orreries
he
seen
used
for
demonstrations
of
planetary
movement
ser
perth
came
over
again
staring
down
at
the
sketch
he
drowned
in
doubt
why
waste
time
drawing
such
engines
if
you
want
a
model
to
determine
how
the
orbits
should
be
we
have
the
finest
orrery
ever
built
here
in
the
camp
we
brought
it
with
us
when
we
moved
since
it
would
be
needed
to
determine
how
the
sky
should
be
repaired
and
to
bring
the
time
and
the
positions
into
congruence
wait
he
dashed
off
calling
two
of
the
mandrakes
after
him
in
a
few
minutes
they
staggered
back
under
a
bulky
affair
in
a
protective
plastic
case
ser
perth
stripped
off
the
case
to
reveal
the
orrery
to
hanson
it
was
a
beautiful
piece
of
workmanship
there
was
an
enormous
sphere
of
thin
crystal
to
represent
the
sky
precious
gems
showed
the
stars
affixed
to
the
dome
the
whole
was
nearly
eight
feet
in
diameter
inside
the
crystal
hanson
could
see
a
model
of
the
world
on
supports
the
planets
and
the
sun
were
set
on
tracks
around
the
outside
with
a
clockwork
drive
mechanism
that
moved
them
by
means
of
stranded
spiderweb
cords
power
came
from
weights
like
those
used
on
an
clock
it
was
obviously
all
hand
work
which
must
make
it
a
thing
of
tremendous
value
here
sather
fareth
spent
his
life
designing
this
ser
perth
said
proudly
it
is
so
well
designed
that
it
can
show
the
position
of
all
things
for
a
thousand
centuries
in
the
past
or
future
by
turning
these
cranks
on
the
control
or
it
will
hold
the
proper
present
positions
for
years
from
its
own
engine
it
beautiful
workmanship
hanson
told
him
as
good
as
the
best
done
on
my
world
ser
perth
went
away
temporarily
pleased
with
himself
and
hanson
stood
staring
at
the
model
it
was
as
good
as
he
said
it
was
and
completely
damning
to
all
of
his
theories
and
hopes
no
model
he
could
make
would
equal
it
but
in
spite
of
it
and
all
its
precise
analogy
to
the
universe
around
him
the
sky
was
still
falling
in
shattered
bits
sather
karf
and
bork
had
come
over
to
join
hanson
they
waited
expectantly
but
hanson
could
think
of
nothing
to
do
it
had
already
been
done
and
had
failed
the
old
man
dropped
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
there
was
the
weight
of
all
his
centuries
on
the
sather
yet
a
curious
toughness
showed
through
his
weariness
what
is
wrong
with
the
orrery
he
asked
nothing
nothing
at
all
damn
it
hanson
told
him
you
wanted
a
computer
and
you
got
it
you
can
feed
in
data
as
to
the
hour
day
month
and
year
turn
the
cranks
and
the
planets
there
will
turn
to
their
proper
position
exactly
as
the
real
planets
should
run
you
need
to
read
the
results
off
graph
paper
what
more
could
any
analogue
computer
do
but
it
does
influence
the
sky
it
was
never
meant
to
the
old
man
said
surprise
in
his
voice
such
power
then
he
stopped
staring
at
hanson
while
something
almost
like
awe
spread
over
his
face
yet
the
prophecy
and
the
monument
were
right
you
have
unlocked
the
impossible
yet
you
seem
to
know
nothing
of
the
laws
of
similarity
or
of
magic
dave
hanson
is
that
crystal
similar
to
the
sky
by
association
by
contagion
or
by
true
symbolism
a
part
may
be
a
symbol
for
the
whole
or
so
may
any
designated
symbol
which
may
influence
the
thing
it
is
if
i
have
a
hair
from
your
head
i
can
model
you
with
power
over
you
but
not
with
the
hair
of
a
pig
that
is
no
true
symbol
suppose
we
substituted
bits
of
the
real
thing
for
these
representations
hanson
asked
bork
nodded
it
might
work
i
heard
you
found
the
sky
material
could
be
melted
and
we
got
enough
of
that
where
it
struck
the
camp
any
one
of
us
who
has
studied
elementary
alchemy
could
blow
a
globe
of
it
to
the
right
size
for
the
sky
dome
and
there
are
a
few
stars
from
which
we
can
chip
pieces
enough
we
can
polish
them
and
put
them
into
the
sphere
where
they
belong
and
it
will
be
risky
but
we
may
even
be
able
to
shape
a
bit
of
the
sun
stuff
to
represent
the
great
orb
in
the
sky
what
about
the
planets
hanson
was
beginning
to
feel
the
depression
lift
you
might
get
a
little
of
mars
since
it
fell
near
here
but
that
still
leaves
the
other
six
that
long
associated
with
a
thing
achieves
the
nature
of
the
thing
sather
karf
intoned
as
if
giving
a
lesson
to
a
kindergarten
student
with
the
right
colors
metals
and
bits
of
jewels
as
well
as
more
secret
symbols
we
can
simulate
the
planets
yet
they
can
not
be
suspended
above
the
dome
as
in
this
orrery
they
must
be
within
the
sky
as
in
nature
how
about
putting
some
iron
in
each
and
using
a
magnet
on
the
control
tracks
to
move
the
planets
hanson
suggested
or
does
cold
iron
ruin
your
conjuring
here
sather
karf
snorted
in
obvious
disgust
but
bork
only
grinned
why
should
it
you
must
have
heard
peasant
superstitions
still
you
have
a
problem
if
two
tracks
met
as
they
do
the
magnets
would
then
affect
both
planets
alike
better
make
two
identical
planets
for
each
and
two
suns
and
put
one
on
your
track
controls
then
one
must
follow
the
other
though
the
one
remain
within
the
sky
hanson
nodded
he
have
to
shield
the
cord
from
the
sun
stuff
but
that
could
be
done
he
wondered
idly
whether
the
real
universe
was
going
to
wind
up
with
tracks
beyond
the
sky
on
which
little
duplicate
planets
ran
just
how
much
similarity
would
there
be
between
model
and
reality
when
this
was
done
if
it
worked
at
all
it
probably
did
matter
and
it
could
hardly
be
worse
than
whatever
the
risers
had
run
into
beyond
the
hole
in
the
present
sky
metaphysics
was
a
subject
with
which
he
was
yet
fully
prepared
to
cope
the
model
of
the
world
inside
the
orrery
must
have
been
made
from
earthly
materials
already
and
it
was
colored
to
depict
land
and
sea
areas
it
could
probably
be
used
at
their
agreement
he
nodded
with
some
satisfaction
that
should
save
some
time
at
least
he
stared
doubtfully
at
the
rods
and
bearings
that
supported
the
model
world
in
the
center
of
the
orrery
what
about
those
things
how
do
we
hold
the
globe
in
the
center
of
everything
bork
shrugged
it
seems
simple
enough
we
fashion
supports
of
more
of
the
sky
material
and
have
real
rods
sticking
up
from
the
poles
in
the
real
universe
hanson
asked
sarcastically
why
not
bork
seemed
surprised
at
hanson
tone
there
have
always
been
such
columns
connecting
the
world
and
the
sky
what
else
would
keep
us
from
falling
hanson
swore
he
might
have
guessed
it
the
only
wonder
was
that
simple
rods
were
used
instead
of
elephants
and
turtles
and
the
fools
had
let
menes
drive
millions
of
slaves
to
death
to
build
a
pyramid
to
the
sky
when
there
were
already
natural
columns
that
could
have
been
used
there
remains
only
one
step
sather
karf
decided
after
a
moment
more
to
make
symbol
and
thing
congruent
all
must
be
invoked
with
the
true
and
secret
name
of
the
universe
hanson
suddenly
remembered
legends
of
the
tetragrammaton
and
the
tales
of
magic
he
read
in
which
there
was
always
one
element
lacking
and
i
suppose
nobody
knows
that
or
dares
to
use
it
there
was
hurt
pride
of
the
aged
face
and
the
ring
of
vast
authority
in
his
voice
then
you
suppose
wrong
dave
hanson
since
this
world
first
came
out
of
duality
a
sather
karf
has
known
that
mystery
make
your
device
and
i
shall
not
fail
in
the
invocation
for
the
first
time
hanson
discovered
that
the
warlocks
could
work
when
they
had
to
however
much
they
disliked
it
and
at
their
own
specialties
they
were
superb
technicians
under
the
orders
of
sather
karf
the
camp
sprang
into
frenzied
but
orderly
activity
they
lost
a
few
mandrakes
in
prying
loose
some
of
the
sun
material
and
more
in
getting
a
small
sphere
of
it
shaped
but
the
remainder
gave
them
the
heat
to
melt
the
sky
stuff
when
it
came
to
glass
blowing
hanson
had
to
admit
they
were
experts
it
should
have
come
as
no
surprise
after
the
elaborate
alchemical
apparatus
he
seen
once
the
crystal
shell
was
cracked
out
of
the
orrery
a
ser
came
in
with
a
long
tube
and
began
working
the
molten
sky
material
getting
the
feel
of
it
he
did
things
hanson
knew
were
nearly
impossible
and
he
did
them
with
the
calm
assurance
of
an
expert
even
when
another
rift
in
the
sky
appeared
with
a
crackling
of
thunder
there
was
no
faltering
on
his
part
the
sky
shell
and
world
supports
were
blown
into
shape
around
the
world
model
inside
the
outer
tracks
in
one
continuous
operation
the
ser
then
clipped
the
stuff
from
his
tube
and
sealed
the
tiny
opening
smoothly
with
a
bit
of
sun
material
on
the
end
of
a
long
metal
wand
interesting
material
he
commented
as
if
only
the
technical
nature
of
the
stuff
had
offered
any
problem
to
him
tiny
carefully
polished
chips
from
the
stars
were
ready
and
men
began
placing
them
delicately
on
the
shell
they
sank
into
it
at
once
and
began
twinkling
the
planets
had
also
been
prepared
and
they
also
went
into
the
shell
while
a
mate
to
each
was
attached
to
the
tracking
mechanism
the
tiny
sun
came
last
hanson
fretted
as
he
saw
it
sink
into
the
shell
sure
it
would
begin
to
melt
the
sky
material
it
seemed
to
have
no
effect
however
apparently
the
sun
was
not
supposed
to
melt
the
sky
when
it
was
in
place
so
the
little
sun
did
melt
the
shell
once
he
was
sure
of
that
he
used
a
scrap
of
the
sky
to
insulate
the
second
little
sun
that
would
control
the
first
sympathetically
from
the
track
he
moved
the
control
delicately
by
hand
and
the
little
sun
followed
dutifully
the
weights
on
the
control
mechanism
were
in
place
hanson
noted
someone
would
probably
have
to
keep
them
wound
from
now
on
unless
they
could
devise
a
foolproof
motor
but
that
was
for
the
future
he
bent
to
the
hand
cranks
sather
karf
was
being
called
to
give
the
exact
settings
for
this
moment
but
hanson
had
a
rough
idea
of
where
the
planets
should
be
he
began
turning
the
crank
just
as
the
sather
came
up
there
was
a
slight
movement
then
the
crank
stuck
and
there
was
a
whirring
of
slipping
gears
the
fools
who
had
moved
the
orrery
must
have
been
so
careless
that
they
sprung
the
mechanism
he
bent
down
to
study
the
tiny
little
jeweled
gears
a
whole
gear
train
was
out
of
place
sather
karf
was
also
inspecting
it
and
the
words
he
cried
did
sound
like
an
invocation
though
they
were
strange
enough
he
straightened
still
cursing
fix
it
i
try
hanson
agreed
doubtfully
but
you
better
get
the
man
who
made
this
he
know
better
than
i
he
was
killed
in
the
first
cracking
of
the
sky
when
a
piece
hit
him
fix
it
dave
hanson
you
claimed
to
be
a
repairman
for
such
devices
hanson
bent
to
study
it
again
using
a
diamond
lens
one
of
the
warlocks
handed
him
it
was
a
useful
device
having
about
a
hundred
times
magnification
without
the
need
for
exact
focusing
he
stared
at
the
jumble
of
fine
gears
then
glanced
out
through
the
open
front
of
the
building
toward
the
sky
there
was
even
less
of
it
showing
than
he
had
remembered
most
of
the
great
dome
was
empty
and
now
there
were
suggestions
of
shadows
in
the
empty
spots
he
looked
away
hastily
shaken
i
need
some
fine
tools
he
said
they
were
lost
in
moving
this
ser
perth
told
him
this
is
the
best
we
can
do
the
jumble
of
tools
had
obviously
been
salvaged
from
the
kits
on
the
tractors
in
the
camp
there
was
one
fairly
small
pair
of
pliers
a
small
pick
and
assorted
useless
junk
he
shook
his
head
hopelessly
fix
it
sather
karf
ordered
again
the
old
man
eyes
were
also
on
the
sky
you
have
ten
minutes
perhaps
no
more
hanson
fingers
steadied
as
he
found
bits
of
wire
and
began
improvising
tools
to
manipulate
the
tiny
gears
the
mechanism
was
a
piece
of
superb
craftsmanship
that
should
have
lasted
for
a
million
years
but
it
had
never
been
meant
to
withstand
the
heavy
shock
of
being
dropped
as
it
must
have
been
and
there
was
very
little
space
inside
it
should
have
been
disassembled
and
put
back
piece
by
piece
but
there
was
no
time
for
that
another
thunder
of
falling
sky
sounded
and
the
ground
heaved
earthquakes
sather
karf
whispered
the
end
is
near
then
a
shout
went
up
and
hanson
jerked
his
eyes
from
the
gears
to
focus
on
a
group
of
rocs
that
were
landing
at
the
far
end
of
the
camp
men
were
springing
from
their
backs
before
they
stopped
running
men
in
dull
robes
with
elaborate
masks
over
their
faces
at
the
front
was
malok
leader
of
the
sons
of
the
egg
brandishing
his
knife
his
voice
carried
clearly
the
egg
hatches
to
the
orrery
and
smash
it
that
was
the
shadow
in
the
pool
destroy
it
before
dave
hanson
can
complete
his
magic
the
men
behind
him
yelled
around
hanson
the
magicians
cried
out
in
shocked
fear
then
old
sather
karf
was
dashing
out
from
under
the
cover
of
the
building
brandishing
a
pole
on
which
a
drop
of
the
was
glowing
his
voice
rose
into
a
command
that
rang
out
over
the
cries
of
the
others
dave
reached
for
a
heavy
hammer
meaning
to
follow
the
old
sather
seemed
to
sense
it
without
looking
back
fix
the
engine
dave
hanson
he
called
it
made
sense
the
others
could
do
the
fighting
but
only
he
had
training
with
such
mechanisms
he
turned
back
to
his
work
just
as
the
warlocks
began
rallying
behind
sather
karf
grabbing
up
what
weapons
they
could
find
there
was
no
magic
in
this
fight
sticks
stones
hammers
and
knives
were
all
that
remained
workable
dave
hanson
bent
over
the
gears
cursing
now
there
was
another
rumble
of
thunder
from
the
falling
sky
the
from
the
reflected
sunlight
dimmed
and
the
ground
shook
violently
another
set
of
gears
broke
from
the
housing
hanson
caught
up
a
bit
of
on
the
sharp
point
of
the
awl
and
brought
it
closer
until
it
burned
his
hands
but
he
had
seen
enough
the
mechanism
was
ruined
beyond
his
chance
to
repair
it
in
time
he
slapped
the
cover
shut
and
stuck
the
awl
where
it
would
light
as
much
of
the
orrery
as
possible
as
always
the
skills
of
his
own
world
had
failed
to
the
blazes
with
it
then
when
in
magic
land
magic
had
to
do
he
thought
of
calling
ser
perth
or
sather
karf
but
there
was
no
time
for
that
and
they
could
hardly
have
heard
him
over
the
sounds
of
the
desperate
fight
going
on
he
bent
to
the
floor
searching
until
he
found
a
ball
of
the
sky
material
that
had
been
pinched
off
when
the
little
opening
was
sealed
further
hunting
gave
him
a
few
bits
of
dust
from
the
star
bits
and
some
of
the
junk
that
had
gone
into
shaping
the
planets
he
brushed
in
some
dirt
from
the
ground
that
had
been
touched
by
the
sun
stuff
and
was
still
glowing
faintly
he
was
at
all
sure
of
how
much
he
could
extrapolate
from
what
he
read
in
the
book
on
applied
semantics
but
he
knew
he
needed
a
control
a
symbol
of
the
symbol
in
this
case
it
was
crude
but
it
might
serve
to
represent
the
orrery
he
clutched
it
in
his
hand
and
touched
it
against
the
orrery
trying
to
remember
the
formula
for
the
giving
of
a
true
name
he
had
to
improvise
but
he
got
through
a
rough
version
of
it
until
he
came
to
the
end
i
who
created
you
name
you
what
the
deuce
did
he
name
it
i
name
you
rumpelstilsken
and
order
you
to
obey
me
when
i
call
you
by
your
name
he
clutched
the
blob
of
material
tighter
in
his
hand
mentally
trying
to
shape
an
order
that
would
backfire
as
such
orders
seemed
to
in
the
childhood
stories
of
magic
he
had
learned
finally
his
lips
whispered
the
simplest
order
he
could
find
rumpelstilsken
repair
yourself
there
was
a
whirring
and
scraping
inside
the
mechanism
and
hanson
let
out
a
yell
he
got
only
a
hasty
glimpse
of
gears
that
seemed
to
be
back
on
their
tracks
before
sather
karf
was
beside
him
driving
the
cranks
with
desperate
speed
we
have
less
than
a
minute
the
old
voice
gasped
the
sather
fingers
spun
on
the
controls
then
he
straightened
moving
his
hands
toward
the
orrery
in
passes
too
rapid
to
be
seen
there
was
a
string
of
obvious
ritual
commands
in
their
sacred
language
then
a
single
word
rang
out
a
string
of
sounds
that
should
have
come
from
no
human
vocal
chords
there
was
a
wrench
and
twist
through
every
atom
of
hanson
body
the
universe
seemed
to
cry
out
over
the
horizon
a
great
burning
disc
rose
and
leaped
toward
the
heavens
as
the
sun
went
back
to
its
place
in
the
sky
the
big
bits
of
around
also
jerked
upwards
revealing
themselves
by
the
wind
they
whipped
up
and
by
the
holes
they
ripped
through
the
roof
of
the
building
hanson
clutched
at
the
scrap
he
had
pocketed
but
it
showed
no
sign
of
leaving
and
the
tiny
blob
of
remained
fixed
to
the
awl
through
the
diamond
lens
hanson
could
see
the
model
of
the
world
in
the
orrery
changing
there
were
clouds
apparently
painted
on
it
where
no
clouds
had
been
and
there
was
an
indication
of
movement
in
the
green
of
the
forests
and
the
blue
of
the
oceans
as
if
trees
were
whipping
in
the
wind
and
waves
lapping
the
shores
when
he
jerked
his
eyes
upward
all
seemed
serene
in
the
sky
sunlight
shone
normally
on
the
world
and
from
under
the
roof
he
could
see
the
gaudy
blue
of
sky
complete
with
the
cracks
in
it
smoothing
out
as
he
watched
the
battle
outside
had
stopped
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
half
the
warlocks
were
lying
motionless
and
the
other
half
had
clustered
together
close
to
the
building
where
hanson
and
sather
karf
stood
the
sons
of
the
egg
seemed
to
have
suffered
less
since
they
greatly
the
others
but
they
were
obviously
more
shocked
by
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
the
healing
of
the
sky
then
malok
voice
rang
out
sharply
it
is
stable
yet
destroy
the
machine
the
egg
must
hatch
he
leaped
forward
brandishing
his
knife
while
the
sons
of
the
egg
fell
in
behind
him
the
warlocks
began
to
close
ranks
falling
back
to
make
a
stand
under
the
jutting
edge
of
the
roof
where
they
could
protect
the
orrery
bork
and
ser
perth
were
among
them
bloody
but
hopelessly
determined
one
look
at
sather
karf
expression
was
enough
to
convince
hanson
that
malok
had
cried
the
truth
and
that
their
work
could
still
be
undone
and
it
was
obvious
that
the
warlocks
could
never
stand
the
charge
of
the
sons
too
many
of
them
had
already
been
killed
and
there
was
no
time
for
reviving
them
sather
karf
was
starting
forward
into
the
battle
but
hanson
made
no
move
to
follow
he
snapped
the
diamond
lens
to
his
eye
and
his
fingers
caught
at
the
drop
of
on
the
awl
he
had
to
hold
it
near
the
glowing
bit
for
steadiness
and
it
began
searing
his
fingers
he
forced
control
on
his
muscles
and
plunged
his
hand
slowly
through
the
sky
sphere
easing
the
glowing
blob
downward
toward
the
spot
on
the
globe
he
had
already
located
with
the
lens
his
thumb
and
finger
moved
downward
delicately
with
all
the
skill
of
practice
at
working
with
nearly
invisibly
fine
wires
on
delicate
instruments
then
he
jerked
his
eyes
away
from
the
model
and
looked
out
something
glaring
and
hot
was
suspended
in
the
air
five
miles
away
he
moved
his
hand
carefully
steadying
it
on
one
of
the
planet
tracks
the
glowing
fire
in
the
air
outside
moved
another
mile
closer
then
another
and
now
around
it
he
could
see
a
monstrous
fingertip
and
something
that
might
have
been
miles
of
thumbnail
the
warlocks
leaped
back
under
the
roof
the
sons
of
the
egg
screamed
and
panicked
jerking
horribly
the
monstrous
thing
moved
again
for
part
of
a
second
it
hovered
over
the
empty
camp
then
it
was
gone
hanson
began
pulling
his
hand
out
through
the
shell
of
the
model
whimpering
as
his
other
hand
clenched
against
the
blob
in
his
pocket
he
had
suddenly
realized
what
horrors
were
possible
to
anyone
who
could
use
the
orrery
now
rumpelstilsken
i
command
you
to
let
no
hand
other
than
mine
enter
and
to
respond
to
no
other
controls
he
hoped
it
would
offer
enough
protection
his
hand
came
free
and
he
threw
the
away
with
a
flick
of
his
wrist
his
hand
ached
with
the
impossible
task
of
steadiness
he
had
set
it
and
his
finger
and
thumb
burned
and
smoked
but
the
wound
was
already
healing
in
the
exposed
section
of
the
camp
the
sons
of
the
egg
were
charred
corpses
there
was
a
fire
starting
on
the
roof
of
the
building
but
others
had
already
run
out
to
quench
that
it
sounded
like
the
snuffling
progress
of
an
undine
across
the
roof
maybe
magic
was
working
again
bork
turned
back
from
the
sight
of
his
former
companions
his
face
was
sick
but
he
managed
to
grin
at
hanson
dave
hanson
to
whom
nothing
is
impossible
he
said
hanson
had
located
nema
finally
as
she
approached
he
caught
her
hand
and
grabbed
bork
arm
like
his
own
it
was
trembling
with
fatigue
and
reaction
come
on
he
said
let
find
some
place
where
we
can
see
whether
impossible
now
for
you
to
magic
up
a
decent
meal
and
a
drink
strong
enough
to
scare
away
the
sylphs
the
sylph
that
found
them
was
scared
by
the
scotch
but
there
was
enough
for
all
of
them
x
three
days
can
work
magic
in
a
world
where
magic
works
the
planets
swung
along
their
paths
again
and
the
sun
was
in
the
most
favorable
house
for
conjuration
the
universe
was
stable
again
there
was
food
for
all
and
houses
had
been
conjured
hastily
to
shelter
the
people
the
plagues
were
gone
now
the
strange
commerce
and
industry
of
this
world
were
humming
again
those
who
had
survived
and
those
who
could
be
revived
were
busily
rebuilding
some
were
missing
of
course
those
who
had
risen
and
hatched
were
beyond
recall
but
no
one
spoke
of
them
if
any
sons
of
the
egg
survived
they
were
quiet
in
their
defeat
hanson
had
been
busy
during
most
of
the
time
it
had
been
taken
for
granted
that
he
would
tend
to
the
orrery
setting
it
for
the
most
favorable
conditions
when
some
special
major
work
of
magic
required
it
and
he
had
taken
the
orders
and
moved
the
controls
as
they
wanted
them
the
orrery
was
housed
temporarily
in
the
reconstituted
hall
of
the
satheri
in
the
capital
city
they
were
building
a
new
hall
for
it
to
be
constructed
only
of
natural
materials
and
hand
labor
but
that
was
a
project
that
would
take
long
months
still
now
the
immediate
pressure
was
gone
and
hanson
was
relaxing
with
bork
and
nema
another
week
bork
was
saying
maybe
less
and
then
gangs
of
the
warlocks
can
spread
out
to
fix
up
all
the
rest
of
the
world
and
to
take
over
control
of
their
slaves
again
are
you
happy
with
your
victory
dave
hanson
hanson
shrugged
he
was
entirely
sure
now
there
was
something
in
the
looks
of
the
sather
who
gave
him
orders
for
new
settings
that
bothered
him
and
some
of
the
developments
he
watched
were
hardly
what
he
would
have
preferred
the
warlocks
had
good
memories
it
seemed
and
there
had
been
manifold
offenses
against
them
while
the
world
was
falling
apart
he
tried
to
put
it
out
of
his
mind
as
he
drew
nema
to
him
she
snuggled
against
him
admiring
him
with
her
eyes
but
old
habits
were
hard
to
break
do
dave
i
a
registered
and
certified
she
stopped
then
blushing
and
bork
chuckled
ser
perth
appeared
at
the
doorway
with
two
of
the
mandrakes
he
motioned
to
hanson
the
council
of
satheri
want
you
he
said
his
eyes
avoided
the
other
and
he
seemed
uncomfortable
why
bork
asked
it
time
for
dave
hanson
reward
ser
perth
said
the
words
were
smooth
enough
but
the
eyes
turned
away
again
hanson
got
up
and
moved
forward
he
had
been
wondering
when
they
would
get
around
to
this
beside
him
bork
and
nema
also
rose
never
trust
a
sather
bork
said
softly
nema
started
to
protest
then
changed
her
mind
she
frowned
torn
between
old
and
new
loyalties
the
summons
was
only
for
dave
hanson
ser
perth
said
sternly
as
the
three
drew
up
to
him
but
as
hanson
took
the
arms
of
the
other
two
the
ser
shrugged
and
fell
in
behind
very
softly
too
low
for
the
hearing
of
the
mandrakes
his
words
sounded
in
hanson
ear
guard
yourself
dave
hanson
so
there
was
to
be
treachery
hanson
thought
he
was
surprised
he
was
probably
lucky
to
have
even
three
friends
the
satheri
would
hardly
feel
very
grateful
to
a
who
had
accomplished
something
beyond
their
power
now
that
the
crisis
was
over
they
had
always
been
a
bunch
apparently
and
he
had
served
his
purpose
but
he
covered
his
thoughts
in
a
neutral
expression
and
went
forward
quietly
toward
the
huge
council
room
the
seventy
leading
satheri
were
all
present
with
sather
karf
presiding
when
hanson
was
ushered
into
their
presence
he
moved
down
the
aisle
not
glancing
at
the
seated
satheri
until
he
was
facing
the
old
man
drawing
nema
and
bork
with
him
there
were
murmurs
of
protest
but
nobody
stopped
him
above
him
the
eyes
of
sather
karf
were
uncertain
for
a
moment
there
seemed
to
be
a
touch
of
friendliness
and
respect
in
them
but
there
was
something
else
that
hanson
liked
far
less
any
warmth
that
was
there
vanished
at
his
first
words
it
about
time
hanson
said
flatly
when
you
wanted
your
world
saved
you
were
free
enough
with
offers
of
reward
but
three
days
have
passed
without
mention
of
it
sather
karf
i
demand
your
secret
name
he
heard
nema
gasp
but
felt
bork
fingers
press
against
his
arm
reassuringly
there
was
a
rising
mutter
of
shock
and
anger
from
the
others
but
he
lifted
his
voice
over
it
and
the
secret
names
of
all
those
present
that
was
also
part
of
the
promised
reward
and
do
you
think
you
could
use
the
names
dave
hanson
sather
karf
asked
against
the
weight
of
all
our
knowledge
do
you
think
you
could
become
our
master
that
easily
hanson
had
his
own
doubts
there
were
methods
against
nearly
all
magic
and
the
book
he
had
read
had
been
only
an
elementary
one
but
he
nodded
i
think
with
your
name
i
could
get
my
hands
on
your
hearts
even
if
you
did
your
worst
it
does
matter
i
claim
my
reward
and
you
shall
have
it
the
word
of
sather
karf
is
good
the
old
man
told
him
but
there
was
no
mention
of
when
you
would
be
given
those
names
you
said
that
when
the
computer
was
finished
you
would
for
my
true
name
and
i
promised
that
you
should
have
it
when
the
time
came
but
not
what
the
time
would
be
so
you
will
wait
or
the
agreement
shall
be
broken
by
you
not
by
me
when
you
are
dying
or
otherwise
beyond
power
over
us
you
shall
have
the
names
dave
hanson
no
hear
me
he
lifted
his
hand
in
a
brief
gesture
and
hanson
felt
a
thickness
over
his
lips
that
made
speech
impossible
we
have
discussed
your
reward
and
you
shall
indeed
have
it
sather
karf
went
on
exactly
as
i
promised
it
to
you
i
agreed
to
find
ways
to
return
you
to
your
own
world
intact
and
you
shall
be
returned
for
a
moment
the
thickness
seemed
to
relax
and
hanson
choked
a
few
words
out
through
it
what
the
world
of
a
sather
karf
a
mandrake
swamp
for
a
yes
but
not
for
you
there
was
something
like
amusement
in
the
old
man
voice
i
never
said
you
were
a
that
was
told
you
by
ser
perth
who
knew
no
better
no
dave
hanson
you
were
too
important
to
us
for
that
are
always
less
than
true
men
and
we
needed
your
best
you
were
conjured
atom
by
atom
id
and
ka
and
soul
from
your
world
even
the
soul
may
be
brought
over
when
enough
masters
of
magic
work
together
and
you
were
our
greatest
conjuration
even
then
we
almost
failed
but
you
no
a
load
of
sickness
seemed
to
leave
hanson
mind
he
had
never
fully
realized
how
much
the
shame
of
what
he
thought
himself
to
be
had
weighed
on
him
then
his
mind
adjusted
to
the
new
facts
dismissing
his
past
worries
i
promised
you
that
we
would
fill
your
entire
lifetime
with
pleasures
sather
karf
went
on
and
you
were
assured
of
jewels
to
buy
an
empire
all
this
the
council
is
prepared
to
give
you
are
you
ready
for
your
reward
no
bork
cry
broke
out
before
hanson
could
answer
the
big
man
was
writhing
before
he
could
finish
the
word
but
his
own
fingers
were
working
in
conjurations
that
seemed
to
hold
back
enough
of
the
spells
against
him
to
let
him
speak
dave
hanson
your
world
was
a
world
of
rigid
laws
you
died
there
and
there
would
be
no
magic
to
avoid
the
fact
that
there
you
must
always
be
dead
hanson
eyes
riveted
on
the
face
of
sather
karf
the
old
man
looked
back
and
finally
nodded
his
head
that
is
true
he
admitted
it
would
have
been
kinder
for
you
not
to
know
but
it
is
the
truth
and
jewels
enough
to
buy
an
empire
on
a
corpse
hanson
accused
a
lifetime
of
pleasures
simple
enough
when
that
lifetime
would
be
over
before
it
began
what
were
the
pleasures
sather
karf
having
you
reveal
your
name
just
before
i
was
sent
back
and
feeling
i
won
he
grimaced
i
reject
the
empty
rewards
of
your
empty
promises
i
also
rejected
the
interpretation
but
i
was
sather
karf
said
and
there
was
a
curious
reluctance
as
he
raised
his
hand
but
it
is
too
late
dave
hanson
prepare
to
receive
your
reward
by
the
power
of
your
name
hanson
hand
went
to
his
pocket
and
squeezed
down
on
the
blob
of
sky
material
there
he
opened
his
mouth
and
found
that
the
thickness
was
back
for
a
split
second
his
mind
screamed
in
panic
as
he
realized
he
could
not
even
pronounce
the
needed
words
then
coldness
settled
over
his
thoughts
as
he
drove
them
to
shape
the
unvoiced
words
in
his
mind
nobody
had
told
him
that
magic
incantations
had
to
be
pronounced
aloud
it
seemed
to
be
the
general
law
but
for
all
he
knew
ignorance
of
the
law
here
might
change
the
law
at
least
he
meant
to
die
trying
if
he
failed
rumpelstilsken
i
command
the
sun
to
set
he
seemed
to
sense
a
hesitation
in
his
mind
and
then
the
impression
of
jeweled
gears
turning
outside
the
window
the
light
reddened
dimmed
and
was
gone
leaving
the
big
room
illuminated
by
only
a
few
witch
lights
the
words
sather
karf
had
been
intoning
came
to
a
sudden
stop
even
before
they
could
be
drowned
in
the
shouts
of
shock
and
panic
from
the
others
his
eyes
centered
questioningly
on
hanson
and
the
flicker
of
a
smile
crossed
his
face
to
the
orrery
he
ordered
use
the
manual
controls
hanson
waited
until
he
estimated
the
men
who
left
would
be
at
the
controls
the
he
clutched
the
again
the
thoughts
in
his
mind
were
clearer
this
time
rumpelstilsken
let
the
sun
rise
from
the
west
and
set
in
the
east
some
of
the
satheri
were
at
the
windows
to
watch
what
happened
this
time
their
shouts
were
more
frightened
than
before
a
minute
later
the
others
were
back
screaming
out
the
news
that
the
manual
controls
could
not
be
moved
could
not
even
be
touched
the
orrery
named
rumpelstilsken
was
obeying
its
orders
fully
and
the
universe
was
obeying
its
symbol
somehow
old
sather
karf
brought
order
out
of
the
frightened
mob
that
had
been
the
greatest
satheri
in
the
world
all
right
dave
hanson
he
said
calmly
return
the
sun
to
its
course
we
agree
to
your
conditions
you
have
heard
them
yet
nevertheless
sather
karf
answered
firmly
we
agree
what
else
can
we
do
if
you
decided
to
wreck
the
sky
again
even
you
might
not
be
able
to
repair
it
a
second
time
he
tapped
his
hands
lightly
together
and
the
sound
of
a
huge
gong
reverberated
in
the
room
let
the
hall
be
cleared
i
will
accept
the
conditions
in
private
there
were
no
objections
a
minute
later
hanson
bork
and
nema
were
alone
with
the
old
man
sunlight
streamed
in
through
the
window
and
there
were
fleecy
clouds
showing
in
the
blue
sky
well
sather
karf
asked
there
was
a
trace
of
a
smile
on
his
face
and
a
glow
of
what
seemed
to
be
amusement
in
his
eyes
as
he
listened
though
hanson
could
see
nothing
amusing
in
the
suggestions
he
was
making
first
of
course
he
meant
to
stay
here
there
was
no
other
place
for
him
but
he
would
have
chosen
to
stay
in
any
event
here
he
had
developed
into
what
he
had
never
even
thought
of
being
and
there
were
still
things
to
be
learned
he
gone
a
long
way
on
what
he
found
in
one
elementary
book
now
with
a
chance
to
study
all
their
magical
lore
and
apply
it
with
the
methods
he
had
learned
in
his
own
world
there
were
amazing
possibilities
opening
up
to
him
for
the
world
a
few
changes
would
be
needed
magic
should
be
limited
to
what
magic
did
best
the
people
needed
to
grow
their
own
food
and
care
for
themselves
and
they
needed
protection
from
the
magicians
there
would
have
to
be
a
code
of
ethics
to
be
worked
out
later
you
got
all
the
time
you
need
to
work
things
out
sathator
hanson
sather
karf
told
him
it
your
world
literally
so
take
your
time
what
do
you
want
first
hanson
considered
it
while
nema
hand
crept
into
his
then
he
grinned
i
guess
i
want
to
get
your
great
granddaughter
turned
into
a
registered
and
certified
wife
and
take
her
on
a
long
honeymoon
he
decided
after
what
you
put
me
through
i
need
a
rest
he
took
her
arm
and
started
down
the
aisle
of
the
council
room
behind
him
he
heard
bork
chuckle
and
the
soft
laughter
of
sather
karf
but
their
faces
were
sobering
by
the
time
he
reached
the
doorway
and
looked
back
i
like
him
too
grandfather
bork
was
saying
well
it
seems
your
group
was
right
after
all
your
prophecy
is
fulfilled
he
may
have
a
little
trouble
with
so
many
knowing
his
name
but
he
dave
hanson
to
whom
nothing
is
impossible
you
should
have
considered
all
the
implications
of
omnipotence
sather
karf
nodded
perhaps
and
perhaps
your
group
was
also
right
bork
it
seems
that
the
has
hatched
his
eyes
lifted
and
centered
on
the
doorway
hanson
puzzled
over
their
words
briefly
as
he
closed
the
door
and
went
out
with
nema
he
probably
have
to
do
something
about
his
name
but
the
rest
of
the
conversation
was
a
mystery
to
him
then
he
dismissed
it
he
could
always
remember
it
when
he
had
more
time
to
think
about
it
it
was
many
millenia
and
several
universes
later
when
dave
hanson
finally
remembered
by
then
it
was
no
mystery
of
course
and
there
was
no
one
who
dared
pronounce
his
