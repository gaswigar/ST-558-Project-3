prefatory
note
schopenhauer
is
one
of
the
few
philosophers
who
can
be
generally
understood
without
a
commentary
all
his
theories
claim
to
be
drawn
direct
from
the
facts
to
be
suggested
by
observation
and
to
interpret
the
world
as
it
is
and
whatever
view
he
takes
he
is
constant
in
his
appeal
to
the
experience
of
common
life
this
characteristic
endows
his
style
with
a
freshness
and
vigor
which
would
be
difficult
to
match
in
the
philosophical
writing
of
any
country
and
impossible
in
that
of
germany
if
it
were
asked
whether
there
were
any
circumstances
apart
from
heredity
to
which
he
owed
his
mental
habit
the
answer
might
be
found
in
the
abnormal
character
of
his
early
education
his
acquaintance
with
the
world
rather
than
with
books
the
extensive
travels
of
his
boyhood
his
ardent
pursuit
of
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
and
without
regard
to
the
emoluments
and
endowments
of
learning
he
was
trained
in
realities
even
more
than
in
ideas
and
hence
he
is
original
forcible
clear
an
enemy
of
all
philosophic
indefiniteness
and
obscurity
so
that
it
may
well
be
said
of
him
in
the
words
of
a
writer
in
the
contemporaine
ce
pas
un
philosophe
comme
les
autres
un
philosophe

a
vu

it
is
not
my
purpose
nor
would
it
be
possible
within
the
limits
of
a
prefatory
note
to
attempt
an
account
of
schopenhauer
philosophy
to
indicate
its
sources
or
to
suggest
or
rebut
the
objections
which
may
be
taken
to
it
ribot
in
his
excellent
little
book
footnote
philosophie
de
par
th
ribot
has
done
all
that
is
necessary
in
this
direction
but
the
essays
here
presented
need
a
word
of
explanation
it
should
be
observed
and
schopenhauer
himself
is
at
pains
to
point
out
that
his
system
is
like
a
citadel
with
a
hundred
gates
at
whatever
point
you
take
it
up
wherever
you
make
your
entrance
you
are
on
the
road
to
the
center
in
this
respect
his
writings
resemble
a
series
of
essays
composed
in
support
of
a
single
thesis
a
circumstance
which
led
him
to
insist
more
emphatically
even
than
most
philosophers
that
for
a
proper
understanding
of
his
system
it
was
necessary
to
read
every
line
he
had
written
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
describe
welt
als
wille
und
as
his
main
thesis
and
his
other
treatises
as
merely
corollary
to
it
the
essays
in
this
volume
form
part
of
the
corollary
they
are
taken
from
a
collection
published
towards
the
close
of
schopenhauer
life
and
by
him
entitled
und
as
being
in
the
nature
of
surplusage
and
illustrative
of
his
main
position
they
are
by
far
the
most
popular
of
his
works
and
since
their
first
publication
in
they
have
done
much
to
build
up
his
fame
written
so
as
to
be
intelligible
enough
in
themselves
the
tendency
of
many
of
them
is
towards
the
fundamental
idea
on
which
his
system
is
based
it
may
therefore
be
convenient
to
summarize
that
idea
in
a
couple
of
sentences
more
especially
as
schopenhauer
sometimes
writes
as
if
his
advice
had
been
followed
and
his
readers
were
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
his
work
all
philosophy
is
in
some
sense
the
endeavor
to
find
a
unifying
principle
to
discover
the
most
general
conception
underlying
the
whole
field
of
nature
and
of
knowledge
by
one
of
those
bold
generalizations
which
occasionally
mark
a
real
advance
in
science
schopenhauer
conceived
this
unifying
principle
this
underlying
unity
to
consist
in
something
analogous
to
that
which
reveals
to
us
is
according
to
him
the
fundamental
reality
of
the
world
the
and
its
objectivation
is
what
is
presented
in
phenomena
the
struggle
of
the
will
to
realize
itself
evolves
the
organism
which
in
its
turn
evolves
intelligence
as
the
servant
of
the
will
and
in
practical
life
the
antagonism
between
the
will
and
the
intellect
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
former
is
the
metaphysical
substance
the
latter
something
accidental
and
secondary
and
further
will
is
that
is
to
say
need
of
something
hence
need
and
pain
are
what
is
positive
in
the
world
and
the
only
possible
happiness
is
a
negation
a
renunciation
of
will
to
it
is
instructive
to
note
as
ribot
points
out
that
in
finding
the
origin
of
all
things
not
in
intelligence
as
some
of
his
predecessors
in
philosophy
had
done
but
in
will
or
the
force
of
nature
from
which
all
phenomena
have
developed
schopenhauer
was
anticipating
something
of
the
scientific
spirit
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
this
it
may
be
added
that
in
combating
the
method
of
fichte
and
hegel
who
spun
a
system
out
of
abstract
ideas
and
in
discarding
it
for
one
based
on
observation
and
experience
schopenhauer
can
be
said
to
have
brought
down
philosophy
from
heaven
to
earth
in
schopenhauer
view
the
various
forms
of
religion
are
no
less
a
product
of
human
ingenuity
than
art
or
science
he
holds
in
effect
that
all
religions
take
their
rise
in
the
desire
to
explain
the
world
and
that
in
regard
to
truth
and
error
they
differ
in
the
main
not
by
preaching
monotheism
polytheism
or
pantheism
but
in
so
far
as
they
recognize
pessimism
or
optimism
as
the
true
description
of
life
hence
any
religion
which
looked
upon
the
world
as
being
radically
evil
appealed
to
him
as
containing
an
indestructible
element
of
truth
i
have
endeavored
to
present
his
view
of
two
of
the
great
religions
of
the
world
in
the
extract
which
concludes
this
volume
and
to
which
i
have
given
the
title
of
christian
the
tenor
of
it
is
to
show
that
however
little
he
may
have
been
in
sympathy
with
the
supernatural
element
he
owed
much
to
the
moral
doctrines
of
christianity
and
of
buddhism
between
which
he
traced
great
resemblance
in
the
following
he
applies
himself
to
a
discussion
of
the
practical
efficacy
of
religious
forms
and
though
he
was
an
enemy
of
clericalism
his
choice
of
a
method
which
allows
both
the
affirmation
and
the
denial
of
that
efficacy
to
be
presented
with
equal
force
may
perhaps
have
been
directed
by
the
consciousness
that
he
could
not
side
with
either
view
to
the
exclusion
of
the
other
in
any
case
his
practical
philosophy
was
touched
with
the
spirit
of
christianity
it
was
more
than
artistic
enthusiasm
which
led
him
in
profound
admiration
to
the
madonna

pessimism
is
commonly
and
erroneously
supposed
to
be
the
distinguishing
feature
of
schopenhauer
system
it
is
right
to
remember
that
the
same
fundamental
view
of
the
world
is
presented
by
christianity
to
say
nothing
of
oriental
religions
that
schopenhauer
conceives
life
as
an
evil
is
a
deduction
and
possibly
a
mistaken
deduction
from
his
metaphysical
theory
whether
his
scheme
of
things
is
correct
or
not
and
it
shares
the
common
fate
of
all
metaphysical
systems
in
being
unverifiable
and
to
that
extent
unprofitable
he
will
in
the
last
resort
have
made
good
his
claim
to
be
read
by
his
insight
into
the
varied
needs
of
human
life
it
may
be
that
a
future
age
will
consign
his
metaphysics
to
the
philosophical
but
he
is
a
literary
artist
as
well
as
a
philosopher
and
he
can
make
a
bid
for
fame
in
either
capacity
what
is
remarked
with
much
truth
of
many
another
writer
that
he
suggests
more
than
he
achieves
is
in
the
highest
degree
applicable
to
schopenhauer
and
his
his
sayings
by
the
way
will
always
find
an
audience
saunders
religion
a
dialogue
between
ourselves
my
dear
fellow
i
do
care
about
the
way
you
sometimes
have
of
exhibiting
your
talent
for
philosophy
you
make
religion
a
subject
for
sarcastic
remarks
and
even
for
open
ridicule
every
one
thinks
his
religion
sacred
and
therefore
you
ought
to
respect
it
that
does
follow
i
do
see
why
because
other
people
are
simpletons
i
should
have
any
regard
for
a
pack
of
lies
i
respect
truth
everywhere
and
so
i
ca
respect
what
is
opposed
to
it
my
maxim
is
veritas
et
pereat
like
the
lawyers
justitia
et
pereat
every
profession
ought
to
have
an
analogous
advice
then
i
suppose
doctors
should
say
pilulae
et
pereat
there
would
be
much
difficulty
about
that
heaven
forbid
you
must
take
everything
grano
exactly
that
why
i
want
you
to
take
religion
grano
i
want
you
to
see
that
one
must
meet
the
requirements
of
the
people
according
to
the
measure
of
their
comprehension
where
you
have
masses
of
people
of
crude
susceptibilities
and
clumsy
intelligence
sordid
in
their
pursuits
and
sunk
in
drudgery
religion
provides
the
only
means
of
proclaiming
and
making
them
feel
the
hight
import
of
life
for
the
average
man
takes
an
interest
primarily
in
nothing
but
what
will
satisfy
his
physical
needs
and
hankerings
and
beyond
this
give
him
a
little
amusement
and
pastime
founders
of
religion
and
philosophers
come
into
the
world
to
rouse
him
from
his
stupor
and
point
to
the
lofty
meaning
of
existence
philosophers
for
the
few
the
emancipated
founders
of
religion
for
the
many
for
humanity
at
large
for
as
your
friend
plato
has
said
the
multitude
ca
be
philosophers
and
you
should
forget
that
religion
is
the
metaphysics
of
the
masses
by
all
means
let
them
keep
it
let
it
therefore
command
external
respect
for
to
discredit
it
is
to
take
it
away
just
as
they
have
popular
poetry
and
the
popular
wisdom
of
proverbs
so
they
must
have
popular
metaphysics
too
for
mankind
absolutely
needs
interpretation
of
and
this
again
must
be
suited
to
popular
comprehension
consequently
this
interpretation
is
always
an
allegorical
investiture
of
the
truth
and
in
practical
life
and
in
its
effects
on
the
feelings
that
is
to
say
as
a
rule
of
action
and
as
a
comfort
and
consolation
in
suffering
and
death
it
accomplishes
perhaps
just
as
much
as
the
truth
itself
could
achieve
if
we
possessed
it
do
take
offense
at
its
unkempt
grotesque
and
apparently
absurd
form
for
with
your
education
and
learning
you
have
no
idea
of
the
roundabout
ways
by
which
people
in
their
crude
state
have
to
receive
their
knowledge
of
deep
truths
the
various
religions
are
only
various
forms
in
which
the
truth
which
taken
by
itself
is
above
their
comprehension
is
grasped
and
realized
by
the
masses
and
truth
becomes
inseparable
from
these
forms
therefore
my
dear
sir
do
take
it
amiss
if
i
say
that
to
make
a
mockery
of
these
forms
is
both
shallow
and
unjust
but
is
it
every
bit
as
shallow
and
unjust
to
demand
that
there
shall
be
no
other
system
of
metaphysics
but
this
one
cut
out
as
it
is
to
suit
the
requirements
and
comprehension
of
the
masses
that
its
doctrine
shall
be
the
limit
of
human
speculation
the
standard
of
all
thought
so
that
the
metaphysics
of
the
few
the
emancipated
as
you
call
them
must
be
devoted
only
to
confirming
strengthening
and
explaining
the
metaphysics
of
the
masses
that
the
highest
powers
of
human
intelligence
shall
remain
unused
and
undeveloped
even
be
nipped
in
the
bud
in
order
that
their
activity
may
not
thwart
the
popular
metaphysics
and
is
this
just
the
very
claim
which
religion
sets
up
is
it
a
little
too
much
to
have
tolerance
and
delicate
forbearance
preached
by
what
is
intolerance
and
cruelty
itself
think
of
the
heretical
tribunals
inquisitions
religious
wars
crusades
cup
of
poison
bruno
and
vanini
death
in
the
flames
is
all
this
quite
a
thing
of
the
past
how
can
genuine
philosophical
effort
sincere
search
after
truth
the
noblest
calling
of
the
noblest
men
be
let
and
hindered
more
completely
than
by
a
conventional
system
of
metaphysics
enjoying
a
state
monopoly
the
principles
of
which
are
impressed
into
every
head
in
earliest
youth
so
earnestly
so
deeply
and
so
firmly
that
unless
the
mind
is
miraculously
elastic
they
remain
indelible
in
this
way
the
groundwork
of
all
healthy
reason
is
once
for
all
deranged
that
is
to
say
the
capacity
for
original
thought
and
unbiased
judgment
which
is
weak
enough
in
itself
is
in
regard
to
those
subjects
to
which
it
might
be
applied
for
ever
paralyzed
and
ruined
which
means
i
suppose
that
people
have
arrived
at
a
conviction
which
they
wo
give
up
in
order
to
embrace
yours
instead
ah
if
it
were
only
a
conviction
based
on
insight
then
one
could
bring
arguments
to
bear
and
the
battle
would
be
fought
with
equal
weapons
but
religions
admittedly
appeal
not
to
conviction
as
the
result
of
argument
but
to
belief
as
demanded
by
revelation
and
as
the
capacity
for
believing
is
strongest
in
childhood
special
care
is
taken
to
make
sure
of
this
tender
age
this
has
much
more
to
do
with
the
doctrines
of
belief
taking
root
than
threats
and
reports
of
miracles
if
in
early
childhood
certain
fundamental
views
and
doctrines
are
paraded
with
unusual
solemnity
and
an
air
of
the
greatest
earnestness
never
before
visible
in
anything
else
if
at
the
same
time
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
about
them
be
completely
passed
over
or
touched
upon
only
to
indicate
that
doubt
is
the
first
step
to
eternal
perdition
the
resulting
impression
will
be
so
deep
that
as
a
rule
that
is
in
almost
every
case
doubt
about
them
will
be
almost
as
impossible
as
doubt
about
one
own
existence
hardly
one
in
ten
thousand
will
have
the
strength
of
mind
to
ask
himself
seriously
and
earnestly
is
that
true
to
call
such
as
can
do
it
strong
minds
is
a
description
more
apt
than
is
generally
supposed
but
for
the
ordinary
mind
there
is
nothing
so
absurd
or
revolting
but
what
if
inculcated
in
that
way
the
strongest
belief
in
it
will
strike
root
if
for
example
the
killing
of
a
heretic
or
infidel
were
essential
to
the
future
salvation
of
his
soul
almost
every
one
would
make
it
the
chief
event
of
his
life
and
in
dying
would
draw
consolation
and
strength
from
the
remembrance
that
he
had
succeeded
as
a
matter
of
fact
almost
every
spaniard
in
days
gone
by
used
to
look
upon
an
da
as
the
most
pious
of
all
acts
and
one
most
agreeable
to
god
a
parallel
to
this
may
be
found
in
the
way
in
which
the
thugs
a
religious
sect
in
india
suppressed
a
short
time
ago
by
the
english
who
executed
numbers
of
them
express
their
sense
of
religion
and
their
veneration
for
the
goddess
kali
they
take
every
opportunity
of
murdering
their
friends
and
traveling
companions
with
the
object
of
getting
possession
of
their
goods
and
in
the
serious
conviction
that
they
are
thereby
doing
a
praiseworthy
action
conducive
to
their
eternal
welfare

illustrations
of
the
history

london
also
the
the
power
of
religious
dogma
when
inculcated
early
is
such
as
to
stifle
conscience
compassion
and
finally
every
feeling
of
humanity
but
if
you
want
to
see
with
your
own
eyes
and
close
at
hand
what
timely
inoculation
will
accomplish
look
at
the
english
here
is
a
nation
favored
before
all
others
by
nature
endowed
more
than
all
others
with
discernment
intelligence
power
of
judgment
strength
of
character
look
at
them
abased
and
made
ridiculous
beyond
all
others
by
their
stupid
ecclesiastical
superstition
which
appears
amongst
their
other
abilities
like
a
fixed
idea
or
monomania
for
this
they
have
to
thank
the
circumstance
that
education
is
in
the
hands
of
the
clergy
whose
endeavor
it
is
to
impress
all
the
articles
of
belief
at
the
earliest
age
in
a
way
that
amounts
to
a
kind
of
paralysis
of
the
brain
this
in
its
turn
expresses
itself
all
their
life
in
an
idiotic
bigotry
which
makes
otherwise
most
sensible
and
intelligent
people
amongst
them
degrade
themselves
so
that
one
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
them
if
you
consider
how
essential
to
such
a
masterpiece
is
inoculation
in
the
tender
age
of
childhood
the
missionary
system
appears
no
longer
only
as
the
acme
of
human
importunity
arrogance
and
impertinence
but
also
as
an
absurdity
if
it
does
confine
itself
to
nations
which
are
still
in
their
infancy
like
caffirs
hottentots
south
sea
islanders
etc
amongst
these
races
it
is
successful
but
in
india
the
brahmans
treat
the
discourses
of
the
missionaries
with
contemptuous
smiles
of
approbation
or
simply
shrug
their
shoulders
and
one
may
say
generally
that
the
proselytizing
efforts
of
the
missionaries
in
india
in
spite
of
the
most
advantageous
facilities
are
as
a
rule
a
failure
an
authentic
report
in
the
vol
xxi
of
the
asiatic
journal
states
that
after
so
many
years
of
missionary
activity
not
more
than
three
hundred
living
converts
were
to
be
found
in
the
whole
of
india
where
the
population
of
the
english
possessions
alone
comes
to
one
hundred
and
fifteen
millions
and
at
the
same
time
it
is
admitted
that
the
christian
converts
are
distinguished
for
their
extreme
immorality
three
hundred
venal
and
bribed
souls
out
of
so
many
millions
there
is
no
evidence
that
things
have
gone
better
with
christianity
in
india
since
then
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
missionaries
are
now
trying
contrary
to
stipulation
and
in
schools
exclusively
designed
for
secular
english
instruction
to
work
upon
the
children
minds
as
they
please
in
order
to
smuggle
in
christianity
against
which
the
hindoos
are
most
jealously
on
their
guard
as
i
have
said
childhood
is
the
time
to
sow
the
seeds
of
belief
and
not
manhood
more
especially
where
an
earlier
faith
has
taken
root
an
acquired
conviction
such
as
is
feigned
by
adults
is
as
a
rule
only
the
mask
for
some
kind
of
personal
interest
and
it
is
the
feeling
that
this
is
almost
bound
to
be
the
case
which
makes
a
man
who
has
changed
his
religion
in
mature
years
an
object
of
contempt
to
most
people
everywhere
who
thus
show
that
they
look
upon
religion
not
as
a
matter
of
reasoned
conviction
but
merely
as
a
belief
inoculated
in
childhood
before
any
test
can
be
applied
and
that
they
are
right
in
their
view
of
religion
is
also
obvious
from
the
way
in
which
not
only
the
masses
who
are
blindly
credulous
but
also
the
clergy
of
every
religion
who
as
such
have
faithfully
and
zealously
studied
its
sources
foundations
dogmas
and
disputed
points
cleave
as
a
body
to
the
religion
of
their
particular
country
consequently
for
a
minister
of
one
religion
or
confession
to
go
over
to
another
is
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
the
catholic
clergy
for
example
are
fully
convinced
of
the
truth
of
all
the
tenets
of
their
church
and
so
are
the
protestant
clergy
of
theirs
and
both
defend
the
principles
of
their
creeds
with
like
zeal
and
yet
the
conviction
is
governed
merely
by
the
country
native
to
each
to
the
south
german
ecclesiastic
the
truth
of
the
catholic
dogma
is
quite
obvious
to
the
north
german
the
protestant
if
then
these
convictions
are
based
on
objective
reasons
the
reasons
must
be
climatic
and
thrive
like
plants
some
only
here
some
only
there
the
convictions
of
those
who
are
thus
locally
convinced
are
taken
on
trust
and
believed
by
the
masses
everywhere
well
no
harm
is
done
and
it
does
make
any
real
difference
as
a
fact
protestantism
is
more
suited
to
the
north
catholicism
to
the
south
so
it
seems
still
i
take
a
higher
standpoint
and
keep
in
view
a
more
important
object
the
progress
namely
of
the
knowledge
of
truth
among
mankind
and
from
this
point
of
view
it
is
a
terrible
thing
that
wherever
a
man
is
born
certain
propositions
are
inculcated
in
him
in
earliest
youth
and
he
is
assured
that
he
may
never
have
any
doubts
about
them
under
penalty
of
thereby
forfeiting
eternal
salvation
propositions
i
mean
which
affect
the
foundation
of
all
our
other
knowledge
and
accordingly
determine
for
ever
and
if
they
are
false
distort
for
ever
the
point
of
view
from
which
our
knowledge
starts
and
as
further
the
corollaries
of
these
propositions
touch
the
entire
system
of
our
intellectual
attainments
at
every
point
the
whole
of
human
knowledge
is
thoroughly
adulterated
by
them
evidence
of
this
is
afforded
by
every
literature
the
most
striking
by
that
of
the
middle
age
but
in
a
too
considerable
degree
by
that
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
look
at
even
the
first
minds
of
all
those
epochs
how
paralyzed
they
are
by
false
fundamental
positions
like
these
how
more
especially
all
insight
into
the
true
constitution
and
working
of
nature
is
as
it
were
blocked
up
during
the
whole
of
the
christian
period
theism
lies
like
a
mountain
on
all
intellectual
and
chiefly
on
all
philosophical
efforts
and
arrests
or
stunts
all
progress
for
the
scientific
men
of
these
ages
god
devil
angels
demons
hid
the
whole
of
nature
no
inquiry
was
followed
to
the
end
nothing
ever
thoroughly
examined
everything
which
went
beyond
the
most
obvious
casual
nexus
was
immediately
set
down
to
those
personalities
was
at
once
explained
by
a
reference
to
god
angels
or
as
pomponatius
expressed
himself
when
the
matter
was
being
discussed
philosophers
at
any
rate
have
nothing
there
is
to
be
sure
a
suspicion
of
irony
in
this
statement
of
pomponatius
as
his
perfidy
in
other
matters
is
known
still
he
is
only
giving
expression
to
the
general
way
of
thinking
of
his
age
and
if
on
the
other
hand
any
one
possessed
the
rare
quality
of
an
elastic
mind
which
alone
could
burst
the
bonds
his
writings
and
he
himself
with
them
were
burnt
as
happened
to
bruno
and
vanini
how
completely
an
ordinary
mind
is
paralyzed
by
that
early
preparation
in
metaphysics
is
seen
in
the
most
vivid
way
and
on
its
most
ridiculous
side
where
such
a
one
undertakes
to
criticise
the
doctrines
of
an
alien
creed
the
efforts
of
the
ordinary
man
are
generally
found
to
be
directed
to
a
careful
exhibition
of
the
incongruity
of
its
dogmas
with
those
of
his
own
belief
he
is
at
great
pains
to
show
that
not
only
do
they
not
say
but
certainly
do
not
mean
the
same
thing
and
with
that
he
thinks
in
his
simplicity
that
he
has
demonstrated
the
falsehood
of
the
alien
creed
he
really
never
dreams
of
putting
the
question
which
of
the
two
may
be
right
his
own
articles
of
belief
he
looks
upon
as
true
and
certain
principles
so
that
your
higher
point
of
view
i
assure
you
there
is
a
higher
still
live
then
is
a
maxim
of
more
comprehensive
import
than
appears
at
first
sight
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
control
the
raw
and
evil
dispositions
of
the
masses
so
as
to
keep
them
from
pushing
injustice
to
extremes
and
from
committing
cruel
violent
and
disgraceful
acts
if
you
were
to
wait
until
they
had
recognized
and
grasped
the
truth
you
would
undoubtedly
come
too
late
and
truth
supposing
that
it
had
been
found
would
surpass
their
powers
of
comprehension
in
any
case
an
allegorical
investiture
of
it
a
parable
or
myth
is
all
that
would
be
of
any
service
to
them
as
kant
said
there
must
be
a
public
standard
of
right
and
virtue
it
must
always
flutter
high
overhead
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
what
heraldic
figures
are
inscribed
on
it
so
long
as
they
signify
what
is
meant
such
an
allegorical
representation
of
truth
is
always
and
everywhere
for
humanity
at
large
a
serviceable
substitute
for
a
truth
to
which
it
can
never
attain
for
a
philosophy
which
it
can
never
grasp
let
alone
the
fact
that
it
is
daily
changing
its
shape
and
has
in
no
form
as
yet
met
with
general
acceptance
practical
aims
then
my
good
philalethes
are
in
every
respect
superior
to
theoretical
what
you
say
is
very
like
the
ancient
advice
of
timaeus
of
locrus
the
pythagorean
the
mind
with
falsehood
if
you
speed
it
with
i
almost
suspect
that
your
plan
is
the
one
which
is
so
much
in
vogue
just
now
that
you
want
to
impress
upon
me
that
the
hour
is
nigh
when
we
may
feast
in
quiet
you
recommend
us
in
fact
to
take
timely
precautions
so
that
the
waves
of
the
discontented
raging
masses
may
disturb
us
at
table
but
the
whole
point
of
view
is
as
false
as
it
is
popular
and
commended
and
so
i
make
haste
to
enter
a
protest
against
it
it
is
that
state
justice
law
can
not
be
upheld
without
the
assistance
of
religion
and
its
dogmas
and
that
justice
and
public
order
need
religion
as
a
necessary
complement
if
legislative
enactments
are
to
be
carried
out
it
is
were
it
repeated
a
hundred
times
an
effective
and
striking
argument
to
the
contrary
is
afforded
by
the
ancients
especially
the
greeks
they
had
nothing
at
all
of
what
we
understand
by
religion
they
had
no
sacred
documents
no
dogma
to
be
learned
and
its
acceptance
furthered
by
every
one
its
principles
to
be
inculcated
early
on
the
young
just
as
little
was
moral
doctrine
preached
by
the
ministers
of
religion
nor
did
the
priests
trouble
themselves
about
morality
or
about
what
the
people
did
or
left
undone
not
at
all
the
duty
of
the
priests
was
confined
to
prayers
hymns
sacrifices
processions
lustrations
and
the
like
the
object
of
which
was
anything
but
the
moral
improvement
of
the
individual
what
was
called
religion
consisted
more
especially
in
the
cities
in
giving
temples
here
and
there
to
some
of
the
gods
of
the
greater
tribes
in
which
the
worship
described
was
carried
on
as
a
state
matter
and
was
consequently
in
fact
an
affair
of
police
no
one
except
the
functionaries
performing
was
in
any
way
compelled
to
attend
or
even
to
believe
in
it
in
the
whole
of
antiquity
there
is
no
trace
of
any
obligation
to
believe
in
any
particular
dogma
merely
in
the
case
of
an
open
denial
of
the
existence
of
the
gods
or
any
other
reviling
of
them
a
penalty
was
imposed
and
that
on
account
of
the
insult
offered
to
the
state
which
served
those
gods
beyond
this
it
was
free
to
everyone
to
think
of
them
what
he
pleased
if
anyone
wanted
to
gain
the
favor
of
those
gods
privately
by
prayer
or
sacrifice
it
was
open
to
him
to
do
so
at
his
own
expense
and
at
his
own
risk
if
he
did
do
it
no
one
made
any
objection
least
of
all
the
state
in
the
case
of
the
romans
everyone
had
his
own
lares
and
penates
at
home
they
were
however
in
reality
only
the
venerated
busts
of
ancestors
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
a
life
beyond
the
grave
the
ancients
had
no
firm
clear
or
least
of
all
dogmatically
fixed
idea
but
very
loose
fluctuating
indefinite
and
problematical
notions
everyone
in
his
own
way
and
the
ideas
about
the
gods
were
just
as
varying
individual
and
vague
there
was
therefore
really
no
in
our
sense
of
the
word
amongst
the
ancients
but
did
anarchy
and
lawlessness
prevail
amongst
them
on
that
account
is
not
law
and
civil
order
rather
so
much
their
work
that
it
still
forms
the
foundation
of
our
own
was
there
not
complete
protection
for
property
even
though
it
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
slaves
and
did
not
this
state
of
things
last
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
so
that
i
ca
recognize
i
must
even
protest
against
the
practical
aims
and
the
necessity
of
religion
in
the
sense
indicated
by
you
and
so
popular
that
is
as
an
indispensable
foundation
of
all
legislative
arrangements
for
if
you
take
that
point
of
view
the
pure
and
sacred
endeavor
after
truth
would
to
say
the
least
appear
quixotic
and
even
criminal
if
it
ventured
in
its
feeling
of
justice
to
denounce
the
authoritative
creed
as
a
usurper
who
had
taken
possession
of
the
throne
of
truth
and
maintained
his
position
by
keeping
up
the
deception
but
religion
is
not
opposed
to
truth
it
itself
teaches
truth
and
as
the
range
of
its
activity
is
not
a
narrow
lecture
room
but
the
world
and
humanity
at
large
religion
must
conform
to
the
requirements
and
comprehension
of
an
audience
so
numerous
and
so
mixed
religion
must
not
let
truth
appear
in
its
naked
form
or
to
use
a
medical
simile
it
must
not
exhibit
it
pure
but
must
employ
a
mythical
vehicle
a
medium
as
it
were
you
can
also
compare
truth
in
this
respect
to
certain
chemical
stuffs
which
in
themselves
are
gaseous
but
which
for
medicinal
uses
as
also
for
preservation
or
transmission
must
be
bound
to
a
stable
solid
base
because
they
would
otherwise
volatilize
chlorine
gas
for
example
is
for
all
purposes
applied
only
in
the
form
of
chlorides
but
if
truth
pure
abstract
and
free
from
all
mythical
alloy
is
always
to
remain
unattainable
even
by
philosophers
it
might
be
compared
to
fluorine
which
can
not
even
be
isolated
but
must
always
appear
in
combination
with
other
elements
or
to
take
a
less
scientific
simile
truth
which
is
inexpressible
except
by
means
of
myth
and
allegory
is
like
water
which
can
be
carried
about
only
in
vessels
a
philosopher
who
insists
on
obtaining
it
pure
is
like
a
man
who
breaks
the
jug
in
order
to
get
the
water
by
itself
this
is
perhaps
an
exact
analogy
at
any
rate
religion
is
truth
allegorically
and
mythically
expressed
and
so
rendered
attainable
and
digestible
by
mankind
in
general
mankind
could
possibly
take
it
pure
and
unmixed
just
as
we
ca
breathe
pure
oxygen
we
require
an
addition
of
four
times
its
bulk
in
nitrogen
in
plain
language
the
profound
meaning
the
high
aim
of
life
can
only
be
unfolded
and
presented
to
the
masses
symbolically
because
they
are
incapable
of
grasping
it
in
its
true
signification
philosophy
on
the
other
hand
should
be
like
the
eleusinian
mysteries
for
the
few
the
i
understand
it
comes
in
short
to
truth
wearing
the
garment
of
falsehood
but
in
doing
so
it
enters
on
a
fatal
alliance
what
a
dangerous
weapon
is
put
into
the
hands
of
those
who
are
authorized
to
employ
falsehood
as
the
vehicle
of
truth
if
it
is
as
you
say
i
fear
the
damage
caused
by
the
falsehood
will
be
greater
than
any
advantage
the
truth
could
ever
produce
of
course
if
the
allegory
were
admitted
to
be
such
i
should
raise
no
objection
but
with
the
admission
it
would
rob
itself
of
all
respect
and
consequently
of
all
utility
the
allegory
must
therefore
put
in
a
claim
to
be
true
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
and
maintain
the
claim
while
at
the
most
it
is
true
only
in
an
allegorical
sense
here
lies
the
irreparable
mischief
the
permanent
evil
and
this
is
why
religion
has
always
been
and
always
will
be
in
conflict
with
the
noble
endeavor
after
pure
truth
oh
no
that
danger
is
guarded
against
if
religion
exactly
confess
its
allegorical
nature
it
gives
sufficient
indication
of
it
how
so
in
its
mysteries
mystery
is
in
reality
only
a
technical
theological
term
for
religious
allegory
all
religions
have
their
mysteries
properly
speaking
a
mystery
is
a
dogma
which
is
plainly
absurd
but
which
nevertheless
conceals
in
itself
a
lofty
truth
and
one
which
by
itself
would
be
completely
incomprehensible
to
the
ordinary
understanding
of
the
raw
multitude
the
multitude
accepts
it
in
this
disguise
on
trust
and
believes
it
without
being
led
astray
by
the
absurdity
of
it
which
even
to
its
intelligence
is
obvious
and
in
this
way
it
participates
in
the
kernel
of
the
matter
so
far
as
it
is
possible
for
it
to
do
so
to
explain
what
i
mean
i
may
add
that
even
in
philosophy
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
make
use
of
a
mystery
pascal
for
example
who
was
at
once
a
pietist
a
mathematician
and
a
philosopher
says
in
this
threefold
capacity
is
everywhere
center
and
nowhere
malebranche
has
also
the
just
remark
is
a
one
could
go
a
step
further
and
maintain
that
in
religions
everything
is
mystery
for
to
impart
truth
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
to
the
multitude
in
its
raw
state
is
absolutely
impossible
all
that
can
fall
to
its
lot
is
to
be
enlightened
by
a
mythological
reflection
of
it
naked
truth
is
out
of
place
before
the
eyes
of
the
profane
vulgar
it
can
only
make
its
appearance
thickly
veiled
hence
it
is
unreasonable
to
require
of
a
religion
that
it
shall
be
true
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
and
this
i
may
observe
in
passing
is
the
absurd
contention
of
rationalists
and
supernaturalists
alike
both
start
from
the
position
that
religion
must
be
the
real
truth
and
while
the
former
demonstrate
that
it
is
not
the
truth
the
latter
obstinately
maintain
that
it
is
or
rather
the
former
dress
up
and
arrange
the
allegorical
element
in
such
a
way
that
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
it
could
be
true
but
would
be
in
that
case
a
platitude
while
the
latter
wish
to
maintain
that
it
is
true
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
without
any
further
dressing
a
belief
which
as
we
ought
to
know
is
only
to
be
enforced
by
inquisitions
and
the
stake
as
a
fact
however
myth
and
allegory
really
form
the
proper
element
of
religion
and
under
this
indispensable
condition
which
is
imposed
by
the
intellectual
limitation
of
the
multitude
religion
provides
a
sufficient
satisfaction
for
those
metaphysical
requirements
of
mankind
which
are
indestructible
it
takes
the
place
of
that
pure
philosophical
truth
which
is
infinitely
difficult
and
perhaps
never
attainable
ah
just
as
a
wooden
leg
takes
the
place
of
a
natural
one
it
supplies
what
is
lacking
barely
does
duty
for
it
claims
to
be
regarded
as
a
natural
leg
and
is
more
or
less
artfully
put
together
the
only
difference
is
that
whilst
a
natural
leg
as
a
rule
preceded
the
wooden
one
religion
has
everywhere
got
the
start
of
philosophy
that
may
be
but
still
for
a
man
who
has
a
natural
leg
a
wooden
one
is
of
great
service
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
metaphysical
needs
of
mankind
absolutely
require
satisfaction
because
the
horizon
of
men
thoughts
must
have
a
background
and
not
remain
unbounded
man
has
as
a
rule
no
faculty
for
weighing
reasons
and
discriminating
between
what
is
false
and
what
is
true
and
besides
the
labor
which
nature
and
the
needs
of
nature
impose
upon
him
leaves
him
no
time
for
such
enquiries
or
for
the
education
which
they
presuppose
in
his
case
therefore
it
is
no
use
talking
of
a
reasoned
conviction
he
has
to
fall
back
on
belief
and
authority
if
a
really
true
philosophy
were
to
take
the
place
of
religion
at
least
of
mankind
would
have
to
receive
it
on
authority
that
is
to
say
it
too
would
be
a
matter
of
faith
for
plato
dictum
that
the
multitude
ca
be
philosophers
will
always
remain
true
authority
however
is
an
affair
of
time
and
circumstance
alone
and
so
it
ca
be
bestowed
on
that
which
has
only
reason
in
its
favor
it
must
accordingly
be
allowed
to
nothing
but
what
has
acquired
it
in
the
course
of
history
even
if
it
is
only
an
allegorical
representation
of
truth
truth
in
this
form
supported
by
authority
appeals
first
of
all
to
those
elements
in
the
human
constitution
which
are
strictly
metaphysical
that
is
to
say
to
the
need
man
feels
of
a
theory
in
regard
to
the
riddle
of
existence
which
forces
itself
upon
his
notice
a
need
arising
from
the
consciousness
that
behind
the
physical
in
the
world
there
is
a
metaphysical
something
permanent
as
the
foundation
of
constant
change
then
it
appeals
to
the
will
to
the
fears
and
hopes
of
mortal
beings
living
in
constant
struggle
for
whom
accordingly
religion
creates
gods
and
demons
whom
they
can
cry
to
appease
and
win
over
finally
it
appeals
to
that
moral
consciousness
which
is
undeniably
present
in
man
lends
to
it
that
corroboration
and
support
without
which
it
would
not
easily
maintain
itself
in
the
struggle
against
so
many
temptations
it
is
just
from
this
side
that
religion
affords
an
inexhaustible
source
of
consolation
and
comfort
in
the
innumerable
trials
of
life
a
comfort
which
does
not
leave
men
in
death
but
rather
then
only
unfolds
its
full
efficacy
so
religion
may
be
compared
to
one
who
takes
a
blind
man
by
the
hand
and
leads
him
because
he
is
unable
to
see
for
himself
whose
concern
it
is
to
reach
his
destination
not
to
look
at
everything
by
the
way
that
is
certainly
the
strong
point
of
religion
if
it
is
a
fraud
it
is
a
pious
fraud
that
is
undeniable
but
this
makes
priests
something
between
deceivers
and
teachers
of
morality
they
dare
teach
the
real
truth
as
you
have
quite
rightly
explained
even
if
they
knew
it
which
is
not
the
case
a
true
philosophy
then
can
always
exist
but
not
a
true
religion
true
i
mean
in
the
proper
understanding
of
the
word
not
merely
in
that
flowery
or
allegorical
sense
which
you
have
described
a
sense
in
which
all
religions
would
be
true
only
in
various
degrees
it
is
quite
in
keeping
with
the
inextricable
mixture
of
weal
and
woe
honesty
and
deceit
good
and
evil
nobility
and
baseness
which
is
the
average
characteristic
of
the
world
everywhere
that
the
most
important
the
most
lofty
the
most
sacred
truths
can
make
their
appearance
only
in
combination
with
a
lie
can
even
borrow
strength
from
a
lie
as
from
something
that
works
more
powerfully
on
mankind
and
as
revelation
must
be
ushered
in
by
a
lie
this
might
indeed
be
regarded
as
the
of
the
moral
world
however
we
wo
give
up
the
hope
that
mankind
will
eventually
reach
a
point
of
maturity
and
education
at
which
it
can
on
the
one
side
produce
and
on
the
other
receive
the
true
philosophy
sigillum
the
naked
truth
must
be
so
simple
and
intelligible
that
it
can
be
imparted
to
all
in
its
true
form
without
any
admixture
of
myth
and
fable
without
disguising
it
in
the
form
of
you
no
notion
how
stupid
most
people
are
i
am
only
expressing
a
hope
which
i
ca
give
up
if
it
were
fulfilled
truth
in
its
simple
and
intelligible
form
would
of
course
drive
religion
from
the
place
it
has
so
long
occupied
as
its
representative
and
by
that
very
means
kept
open
for
it
the
time
would
have
come
when
religion
would
have
carried
out
her
object
and
completed
her
course
the
race
she
had
brought
to
years
of
discretion
she
could
dismiss
and
herself
depart
in
peace
that
would
be
the
of
religion
but
as
long
as
she
lives
she
has
two
faces
one
of
truth
one
of
fraud
according
as
you
look
at
one
or
the
other
you
will
bear
her
favor
or
religion
must
be
regarded
as
a
necessary
evil
its
necessity
resting
on
the
pitiful
imbecility
of
the
great
majority
of
mankind
incapable
of
grasping
the
truth
and
therefore
requiring
in
its
pressing
need
something
to
take
its
place
really
one
would
think
that
you
philosophers
had
truth
in
a
cupboard
and
that
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
go
and
get
it
well
if
we
have
got
it
it
is
chiefly
owing
to
the
pressure
put
upon
philosophy
by
religion
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
people
have
tried
to
make
the
expression
and
communication
of
truth
even
the
contemplation
and
discovery
of
it
impossible
by
putting
children
in
their
earliest
years
into
the
hands
of
priests
to
be
manipulated
to
have
the
lines
in
which
their
fundamental
thoughts
are
henceforth
to
run
laid
down
with
such
firmness
as
in
essential
matters
to
be
fixed
and
determined
for
this
whole
life
when
i
take
up
the
writings
even
of
the
best
intellects
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
more
especially
if
i
have
been
engaged
in
oriental
studies
i
am
sometimes
shocked
to
see
how
they
are
paralyzed
and
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
by
jewish
ideas
how
can
anyone
think
out
the
true
philosophy
when
he
is
prepared
like
this
even
if
the
true
philosophy
were
to
be
discovered
religion
would
disappear
from
the
world
as
you
seem
to
think
there
ca
be
one
system
of
metaphysics
for
everybody
that
rendered
impossible
by
the
natural
differences
of
intellectual
power
between
man
and
man
and
the
differences
too
which
education
makes
it
is
a
necessity
for
the
great
majority
of
mankind
to
engage
in
that
severe
bodily
labor
which
can
not
be
dispensed
with
if
the
ceaseless
requirements
of
the
whole
race
are
to
be
satisfied
not
only
does
this
leave
the
majority
no
time
for
education
for
learning
for
contemplation
but
by
virtue
of
the
hard
and
fast
antagonism
between
muscles
and
mind
the
intelligence
is
blunted
by
so
much
exhausting
bodily
labor
and
becomes
heavy
clumsy
awkward
and
consequently
incapable
of
grasping
any
other
than
quite
simple
situations
at
least
of
the
human
race
falls
under
this
category
but
still
the
people
require
a
system
of
metaphysics
that
is
an
account
of
the
world
and
our
existence
because
such
an
account
belongs
to
the
most
natural
needs
of
mankind
they
require
a
popular
system
and
to
be
popular
it
must
combine
many
rare
qualities
it
must
be
easily
understood
and
at
the
same
time
possess
on
the
proper
points
a
certain
amount
of
obscurity
even
of
impenetrability
then
a
correct
and
satisfactory
system
of
morality
must
be
bound
up
with
its
dogmas
above
all
it
must
afford
inexhaustible
consolation
in
suffering
and
death
the
consequence
of
all
this
is
that
it
can
only
be
true
in
an
allegorical
and
not
in
a
real
sense
further
it
must
have
the
support
of
an
authority
which
is
impressive
by
its
great
age
by
being
universally
recognized
by
its
documents
their
tone
and
utterances
qualities
which
are
so
extremely
difficult
to
combine
that
many
a
man
would
be
so
ready
if
he
considered
the
matter
to
help
to
undermine
a
religion
but
would
reflect
that
what
he
is
attacking
is
a
people
most
sacred
treasure
if
you
want
to
form
an
opinion
on
religion
you
should
always
bear
in
mind
the
character
of
the
great
multitude
for
which
it
is
destined
and
form
a
picture
to
yourself
of
its
complete
inferiority
moral
and
intellectual
it
is
incredible
how
far
this
inferiority
goes
and
how
perseveringly
a
spark
of
truth
will
glimmer
on
even
under
the
crudest
covering
of
monstrous
fable
or
grotesque
ceremony
clinging
indestructibly
like
the
odor
of
musk
to
everything
that
has
once
come
into
contact
with
it
in
illustration
of
this
consider
the
profound
wisdom
of
the
upanishads
and
then
look
at
the
mad
idolatry
in
the
india
of
with
its
pilgrimages
processions
and
festivities
or
at
the
insane
and
ridiculous
of
the
saniassi
still
one
ca
deny
that
in
all
this
insanity
and
nonsense
there
lies
some
obscure
purpose
which
accords
with
or
is
a
reflection
of
the
profound
wisdom
i
mentioned
but
for
the
brute
multitude
it
had
to
be
dressed
up
in
this
form
in
such
a
contrast
as
this
we
have
the
two
poles
of
humanity
the
wisdom
of
the
individual
and
the
bestiality
of
the
many
both
of
which
find
their
point
of
contact
in
the
moral
sphere
that
saying
from
the
kurral
must
occur
to
everybody
people
look
like
men
but
i
have
never
seen
their
exact
the
man
of
education
may
all
the
same
interpret
religion
to
himself
grano
the
man
of
learning
the
contemplative
spirit
may
secretly
exchange
it
for
a
philosophy
but
here
again
one
philosophy
would
suit
everybody
by
the
laws
of
affinity
every
system
would
draw
to
itself
that
public
to
whose
education
and
capacities
it
was
most
suited
so
there
is
always
an
inferior
metaphysical
system
of
the
schools
for
the
educated
multitude
and
a
higher
one
for
the
kant
lofty
doctrine
for
instance
had
to
be
degraded
to
the
level
of
the
schools
and
ruined
by
such
men
as
fries
krug
and
salat
in
short
here
if
anywhere
goethe
maxim
is
true
does
not
suit
pure
faith
in
revelation
and
pure
metaphysics
are
for
the
two
extremes
and
for
the
intermediate
steps
mutual
modifications
of
both
in
innumerable
combinations
and
gradations
and
this
is
rendered
necessary
by
the
immeasurable
differences
which
nature
and
education
have
placed
between
man
and
man
the
view
you
take
reminds
me
seriously
of
the
mysteries
of
the
ancients
which
you
mentioned
just
now
their
fundamental
purpose
seems
to
have
been
to
remedy
the
evil
arising
from
the
differences
of
intellectual
capacity
and
education
the
plan
was
out
of
the
great
multitude
utterly
impervious
to
unveiled
truth
to
select
certain
persons
who
might
have
it
revealed
to
them
up
to
a
given
point
out
of
these
again
to
choose
others
to
whom
more
would
be
revealed
as
being
able
to
grasp
more
and
so
on
up
to
the
epopts
these
grades
correspond
to
the
little
greater
and
greatest
mysteries
the
arrangement
was
founded
on
a
correct
estimate
of
the
intellectual
inequality
of
mankind
to
some
extent
the
education
in
our
lower
middle
and
high
schools
corresponds
to
the
varying
grades
of
initiation
into
the
mysteries
in
a
very
approximate
way
and
then
only
in
so
far
as
subjects
of
higher
knowledge
are
written
about
exclusively
in
latin
but
since
that
has
ceased
to
be
the
case
all
the
mysteries
are
profaned
however
that
may
be
i
wanted
to
remind
you
that
you
should
look
at
religion
more
from
the
practical
than
from
the
theoretical
side
metaphysics
may
be
the
enemy
of
religion
but
all
the
same
morality
will
be
its
friend
perhaps
the
metaphysical
element
in
all
religions
is
false
but
the
moral
element
in
all
is
true
this
might
perhaps
be
presumed
from
the
fact
that
they
all
disagree
in
their
metaphysics
but
are
in
accord
as
regards
morality
which
is
an
illustration
of
the
rule
of
logic
that
false
premises
may
give
a
true
conclusion
let
me
hold
you
to
your
conclusion
let
me
remind
you
that
religion
has
two
sides
if
it
ca
stand
when
looked
at
from
its
theoretical
that
is
its
intellectual
side
on
the
other
hand
from
the
moral
side
it
proves
itself
the
only
means
of
guiding
controlling
and
mollifying
those
races
of
animals
endowed
with
reason
whose
kinship
with
the
ape
does
not
exclude
a
kinship
with
the
tiger
but
at
the
same
time
religion
is
as
a
rule
a
sufficient
satisfaction
for
their
dull
metaphysical
necessities
you
do
seem
to
me
to
possess
a
proper
idea
of
the
difference
wide
as
the
heavens
asunder
the
deep
gulf
between
your
man
of
learning
and
enlightenment
accustomed
to
the
process
of
thinking
and
the
heavy
clumsy
dull
and
sluggish
consciousness
of
humanity
beasts
of
burden
whose
thoughts
have
once
and
for
all
taken
the
direction
of
anxiety
about
their
livelihood
and
can
not
be
put
in
motion
in
any
other
whose
muscular
strength
is
so
exclusively
brought
into
play
that
the
nervous
power
which
makes
intelligence
sinks
to
a
very
low
ebb
people
like
that
must
have
something
tangible
which
they
can
lay
hold
of
on
the
slippery
and
thorny
pathway
of
their
life
some
sort
of
beautiful
fable
by
means
of
which
things
can
be
imparted
to
them
which
their
crude
intelligence
can
entertain
only
in
picture
and
parable
profound
explanations
and
fine
distinctions
are
thrown
away
upon
them
if
you
conceive
religion
in
this
light
and
recollect
that
its
aims
are
above
all
practical
and
only
in
a
subordinate
degree
theoretical
it
will
appear
to
you
as
something
worthy
of
the
highest
respect
a
respect
which
will
finally
rest
upon
the
principle
that
the
end
sanctifies
the
means
i
do
feel
in
favor
of
a
compromise
on
a
basis
like
that
religion
may
be
an
excellent
means
of
training
the
perverse
obtuse
and
members
of
the
biped
race
in
the
eyes
of
the
friend
of
truth
every
fraud
even
though
it
be
a
pious
one
is
to
be
condemned
a
system
of
deception
a
pack
of
lies
would
be
a
strange
means
of
inculcating
virtue
the
flag
to
which
i
have
taken
the
oath
is
truth
i
shall
remain
faithful
to
it
everywhere
and
whether
i
succeed
or
not
i
shall
fight
for
light
and
truth
if
i
see
religion
on
the
wrong
side
but
you
wo
religion
is
a
deception
it
is
true
and
the
most
important
of
all
truths
because
its
doctrines
are
as
i
have
said
of
such
a
lofty
kind
that
the
multitude
ca
grasp
them
without
an
intermediary
because
i
say
its
light
would
blind
the
ordinary
eye
it
comes
forward
wrapt
in
the
veil
of
allegory
and
teaches
not
indeed
what
is
exactly
true
in
itself
but
what
is
true
in
respect
of
the
lofty
meaning
contained
in
it
and
understood
in
this
way
religion
is
the
truth
it
would
be
all
right
if
religion
were
only
at
liberty
to
be
true
in
a
merely
allegorical
sense
but
its
contention
is
that
it
is
downright
true
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
herein
lies
the
deception
and
it
is
here
that
the
friend
of
truth
must
take
up
a
hostile
position
the
deception
is
a
qua
if
religion
were
to
admit
that
it
was
only
the
allegorical
meaning
in
its
doctrine
which
was
true
it
would
rob
itself
of
all
efficacy
such
rigorous
treatment
as
this
would
destroy
its
invaluable
influence
on
the
hearts
and
morals
of
mankind
instead
of
insisting
on
that
with
pedantic
obstinacy
look
at
its
great
achievements
in
the
practical
sphere
its
furtherance
of
good
and
kindly
feelings
its
guidance
in
conduct
the
support
and
consolation
it
gives
to
suffering
humanity
in
life
and
death
how
much
you
ought
to
guard
against
letting
theoretical
cavils
discredit
in
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
and
finally
wrest
from
it
something
which
is
an
inexhaustible
source
of
consolation
and
tranquillity
something
which
in
its
hard
lot
it
needs
so
much
even
more
than
we
do
on
that
score
alone
religion
should
be
free
from
attack
with
that
kind
of
argument
you
could
have
driven
luther
from
the
field
when
he
attacked
the
sale
of
indulgences
how
many
a
one
got
consolation
from
the
letters
of
indulgence
a
consolation
which
nothing
else
could
give
a
complete
tranquillity
so
that
he
joyfully
departed
with
the
fullest
confidence
in
the
packet
of
them
which
he
held
in
his
hand
at
the
hour
of
death
convinced
that
they
were
so
many
cards
of
admission
to
all
the
nine
heavens
what
is
the
use
of
grounds
of
consolation
and
tranquillity
which
are
constantly
overshadowed
by
the
of
illusion
the
truth
my
dear
sir
is
the
only
safe
thing
the
truth
alone
remains
steadfast
and
trusty
it
is
the
only
solid
consolation
it
is
the
indestructible
diamond
yes
if
you
had
truth
in
your
pocket
ready
to
favor
us
with
it
on
demand
all
you
got
are
metaphysical
systems
in
which
nothing
is
certain
but
the
headaches
they
cost
before
you
take
anything
away
you
must
have
something
better
to
put
in
its
place
that
what
you
keep
on
saying
to
free
a
man
from
error
is
to
give
not
to
take
away
knowledge
that
a
thing
is
false
is
a
truth
error
always
does
harm
sooner
or
later
it
will
bring
mischief
to
the
man
who
harbors
it
then
give
up
deceiving
people
confess
ignorance
of
what
you
do
know
and
leave
everyone
to
form
his
own
articles
of
faith
for
himself
perhaps
they
wo
turn
out
so
bad
especially
as
they
rub
one
another
corners
down
and
mutually
rectify
mistakes
the
existence
of
many
views
will
at
any
rate
lay
a
foundation
of
tolerance
those
who
possess
knowledge
and
capacity
may
betake
themselves
to
the
study
of
philosophy
or
even
in
their
own
persons
carry
the
history
of
philosophy
a
step
further
that
be
a
pretty
business
a
whole
nation
of
raw
metaphysicians
wrangling
and
eventually
coming
to
blows
with
one
another
well
well
a
few
blows
here
and
there
are
the
sauce
of
life
or
at
any
rate
a
very
inconsiderable
evil
compared
with
such
things
as
priestly
dominion
plundering
of
the
laity
persecution
of
heretics
courts
of
inquisition
crusades
religious
wars
massacres
of
bartholomew
these
have
been
the
result
of
popular
metaphysics
imposed
from
without
so
i
stick
to
the
old
saying
that
you
ca
get
grapes
from
thistles
nor
expect
good
to
come
from
a
pack
of
lies
how
often
must
i
repeat
that
religion
is
anything
but
a
pack
of
lies
it
is
truth
itself
only
in
a
mythical
allegorical
vesture
but
when
you
spoke
of
your
plan
of
everyone
being
his
own
founder
of
religion
i
wanted
to
say
that
a
particularism
like
this
is
totally
opposed
to
human
nature
and
would
consequently
destroy
all
social
order
man
is
a
metaphysical
animal
that
is
to
say
he
has
paramount
metaphysical
necessities
accordingly
he
conceives
life
above
all
in
its
metaphysical
signification
and
wishes
to
bring
everything
into
line
with
that
consequently
however
strange
it
may
sound
in
view
of
the
uncertainty
of
all
dogmas
agreement
in
the
fundamentals
of
metaphysics
is
the
chief
thing
because
a
genuine
and
lasting
bond
of
union
is
only
possible
among
those
who
are
of
one
opinion
on
these
points
as
a
result
of
this
the
main
point
of
likeness
and
of
contrast
between
nations
is
rather
religion
than
government
or
even
language
and
so
the
fabric
of
society
the
state
will
stand
firm
only
when
founded
on
a
system
of
metaphysics
which
is
acknowledged
by
all
this
of
course
can
only
be
a
popular
system
that
is
a
religion
it
becomes
part
and
parcel
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
all
the
public
manifestations
of
the
national
life
and
also
of
all
solemn
acts
of
individuals
this
was
the
case
in
ancient
india
among
the
persians
egyptians
jews
greeks
and
romans
it
is
still
the
case
in
the
brahman
buddhist
and
mohammedan
nations
in
china
there
are
three
faiths
it
is
true
of
which
the
most
prevalent
buddhism
is
precisely
the
one
which
is
not
protected
by
the
state
still
there
is
a
saying
in
china
universally
acknowledged
and
of
daily
application
that
the
three
faiths
are
only
one
that
is
to
say
they
agree
in
essentials
the
emperor
confesses
all
three
together
at
the
same
time
and
europe
is
the
union
of
christian
states
christianity
is
the
basis
of
every
one
of
the
members
and
the
common
bond
of
all
hence
turkey
though
geographically
in
europe
is
not
properly
to
be
reckoned
as
belonging
to
it
in
the
same
way
the
european
princes
hold
their
place
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
pope
is
the
vicegerent
of
god
accordingly
as
his
throne
was
the
highest
he
used
to
wish
all
thrones
to
be
regarded
as
held
in
fee
from
him
in
the
same
way
too
archbishops
and
bishops
as
such
possessed
temporal
power
and
in
england
they
still
have
seats
and
votes
in
the
upper
house
protestant
princes
as
such
are
heads
of
their
churches
in
england
a
few
years
ago
this
was
a
girl
eighteen
years
old
by
the
revolt
from
the
pope
the
reformation
shattered
the
european
fabric
and
in
a
special
degree
dissolved
the
true
unity
of
germany
by
destroying
its
common
religious
faith
this
union
which
had
practically
come
to
an
end
had
accordingly
to
be
restored
later
on
by
artificial
and
purely
political
means
you
see
then
how
closely
connected
a
common
faith
is
with
the
social
order
and
the
constitution
of
every
state
faith
is
everywhere
the
support
of
the
laws
and
the
constitution
the
foundation
therefore
of
the
social
fabric
which
could
hardly
hold
together
at
all
if
religion
did
not
lend
weight
to
the
authority
of
government
and
the
dignity
of
the
ruler
oh
yes
princes
use
god
as
a
kind
of
bogey
to
frighten
children
to
bed
with
if
nothing
else
avails
that
why
they
attach
so
much
importance
to
the
deity
very
well
let
me
in
passing
recommend
our
rulers
to
give
their
serious
attention
regularly
twice
every
year
to
the
fifteenth
chapter
of
the
first
book
of
samuel
that
they
may
be
constantly
reminded
of
what
it
means
to
prop
the
throne
on
the
altar
besides
since
the
stake
that
ration
has
gone
out
of
fashion
this
method
of
government
has
lost
its
efficacy
for
as
you
know
religions
are
like
they
shine
only
when
it
is
dark
a
certain
amount
of
general
ignorance
is
the
condition
of
all
religions
the
element
in
which
alone
they
can
exist
and
as
soon
as
astronomy
natural
science
geology
history
the
knowledge
of
countries
and
peoples
have
spread
their
light
broadcast
and
philosophy
finally
is
permitted
to
say
a
word
every
faith
founded
on
miracles
and
revelation
must
disappear
and
philosophy
takes
its
place
in
europe
the
day
of
knowledge
and
science
dawned
towards
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
with
the
appearance
of
the
renaissance
platonists
its
sun
rose
higher
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
so
rich
in
results
and
scattered
the
mists
of
the
middle
age
church
and
faith
were
compelled
to
disappear
in
the
same
proportion
and
so
in
the
eighteenth
century
english
and
french
philosophers
were
able
to
take
up
an
attitude
of
direct
hostility
until
finally
under
frederick
the
great
kant
appeared
and
took
away
from
religious
belief
the
support
it
had
previously
enjoyed
from
philosophy
he
emancipated
the
handmaid
of
theology
and
in
attacking
the
question
with
german
thoroughness
and
patience
gave
it
an
earnest
instead
of
a
frivolous
tone
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
we
see
christianity
undermined
in
the
nineteenth
century
a
serious
faith
in
it
almost
completely
gone
we
see
it
fighting
even
for
bare
existence
whilst
anxious
princes
try
to
set
it
up
a
little
by
artificial
means
as
a
doctor
uses
a
drug
on
a
dying
patient
in
this
connection
there
is
a
passage
in
progrès
de
which
looks
as
if
written
as
a
warning
to
our
age
the
religious
zeal
shown
by
philosophers
and
great
men
was
only
a
political
devotion
and
every
religion
which
allows
itself
to
be
defended
as
a
belief
that
may
usefully
be
left
to
the
people
can
only
hope
for
an
agony
more
or
less
prolonged
in
the
whole
course
of
the
events
which
i
have
indicated
you
may
always
observe
that
faith
and
knowledge
are
related
as
the
two
scales
of
a
balance
when
the
one
goes
up
the
other
goes
down
so
sensitive
is
the
balance
that
it
indicates
momentary
influences
when
for
instance
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
those
inroads
of
french
robbers
under
the
leadership
of
bonaparte
and
the
enormous
efforts
necessary
for
driving
them
out
and
punishing
them
had
brought
about
a
temporary
neglect
of
science
and
consequently
a
certain
decline
in
the
general
increase
of
knowledge
the
church
immediately
began
to
raise
her
head
again
and
faith
began
to
show
fresh
signs
of
life
which
to
be
sure
in
keeping
with
the
times
was
partly
poetical
in
its
nature
on
the
other
hand
in
the
more
than
thirty
years
of
peace
which
followed
leisure
and
prosperity
furthered
the
building
up
of
science
and
the
spread
of
knowledge
in
an
extraordinary
degree
the
consequence
of
which
is
what
i
have
indicated
the
dissolution
and
threatened
fall
of
religion
perhaps
the
time
is
approaching
which
has
so
often
been
prophesied
when
religion
will
take
her
departure
from
european
humanity
like
a
nurse
which
the
child
has
outgrown
the
child
will
now
be
given
over
to
the
instructions
of
a
tutor
for
there
is
no
doubt
that
religious
doctrines
which
are
founded
merely
on
authority
miracles
and
revelations
are
only
suited
to
the
childhood
of
humanity
everyone
will
admit
that
a
race
the
past
duration
of
which
on
the
earth
all
accounts
physical
and
historical
agree
in
placing
at
not
more
than
some
hundred
times
the
life
of
a
man
of
sixty
is
as
yet
only
in
its
first
childhood
instead
of
taking
an
undisguised
pleasure
in
prophesying
the
downfall
of
christianity
how
i
wish
you
would
consider
what
a
measureless
debt
of
gratitude
european
humanity
owes
to
it
how
greatly
it
has
benefited
by
the
religion
which
after
a
long
interval
followed
it
from
its
old
home
in
the
east
europe
received
from
christianity
ideas
which
were
quite
new
to
it
the
knowledge
i
mean
of
the
fundamental
truth
that
life
can
not
be
an
that
the
true
end
of
our
existence
lies
beyond
it
the
greeks
and
romans
had
placed
this
end
altogether
in
our
present
life
so
that
in
this
sense
they
may
certainly
be
called
blind
heathens
and
in
keeping
with
this
view
of
life
all
their
virtues
can
be
reduced
to
what
is
serviceable
to
the
community
to
what
is
useful
in
fact
aristotle
says
quite
naively
virtues
must
necessarily
be
the
greatest
which
are
the
most
useful
to
so
the
ancients
thought
patriotism
the
highest
virtue
although
it
is
really
a
very
doubtful
one
since
narrowness
prejudice
vanity
and
an
enlightened
are
main
elements
in
it
just
before
the
passage
i
quoted
aristotle
enumerates
all
the
virtues
in
order
to
discuss
them
singly
they
are
courage
temperance
magnificence
magnanimity
liberality
gentleness
good
and
how
different
from
the
christian
virtues
plato
himself
incomparably
the
most
transcendental
philosopher
of
antiquity
knows
no
higher
virtue
than
and
he
alone
recommends
it
unconditionally
and
for
its
own
sake
whereas
the
rest
make
a
happy
life
the
aim
of
all
virtue
and
moral
conduct
the
way
to
attain
it
christianity
freed
european
humanity
from
this
shallow
crude
identification
of
itself
with
the
hollow
uncertain
existence
of
every
day
coelumque
tueri
jussit
et
erectos
ad
sidera
tollere
vultus
christianity
accordingly
does
not
preach
mere
justice
but
love
of
mankind
compassion
good
works
forgiveness
love
of
your
enemies
patience
humility
resignation
and
it
even
went
a
step
further
and
taught
that
the
world
is
of
evil
and
that
we
need
deliverance
it
preached
despisal
of
the
world
chastity
giving
up
of
one
will
that
is
turning
away
from
life
and
its
illusory
pleasures
it
taught
the
healing
power
of
pain
an
instrument
of
torture
is
the
symbol
of
christianity
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
that
this
earnest
this
only
correct
view
of
life
was
thousands
of
years
previously
spread
all
over
asia
in
other
forms
as
it
is
still
independently
of
christianity
but
for
european
humanity
it
was
a
new
and
great
revelation
for
it
is
well
known
that
the
population
of
europe
consists
of
asiatic
races
driven
out
as
wanderers
from
their
own
homes
and
gradually
settling
down
in
europe
on
their
wanderings
these
races
lost
the
original
religion
of
their
homes
and
with
it
the
right
view
of
life
so
under
a
new
sky
they
formed
religions
for
themselves
which
were
rather
crude
the
worship
of
odin
for
instance
the
druidic
or
the
greek
religion
the
metaphysical
content
of
which
was
little
and
shallow
in
the
meantime
the
greeks
developed
a
special
one
might
almost
say
an
instinctive
sense
of
beauty
belonging
to
them
alone
of
all
the
nations
who
have
ever
existed
on
the
earth
peculiar
fine
and
exact
so
that
their
mythology
took
in
the
mouth
of
their
poets
and
in
the
hands
of
their
artists
an
exceedingly
beautiful
and
pleasing
shape
on
the
other
hand
the
true
and
deep
significance
of
life
was
lost
to
the
greeks
and
romans
they
lived
on
like
children
till
christianity
came
and
recalled
them
to
the
serious
side
of
existence
and
to
see
the
effects
one
need
only
compare
antiquity
with
the
middle
age
the
time
of
pericles
say
with
the
fourteenth
century
you
could
scarcely
believe
you
were
dealing
with
the
same
kind
of
beings
there
the
finest
development
of
humanity
excellent
institutions
wise
laws
shrewdly
apportioned
offices
rationally
ordered
freedom
all
the
arts
including
poetry
and
philosophy
at
their
best
the
production
of
works
which
after
thousands
of
years
are
unparalleled
the
creations
as
it
were
of
a
higher
order
of
beings
which
we
can
never
imitate
life
embellished
by
the
noblest
fellowship
as
portrayed
in
xenophen
look
on
the
other
picture
if
you
can
a
time
at
which
the
church
had
enslaved
the
minds
and
violence
the
bodies
of
men
that
knights
and
priests
might
lay
the
whole
weight
of
life
upon
the
common
beast
of
burden
the
third
estate
there
you
have
might
as
right
feudalism
and
fanaticism
in
close
alliance
and
in
their
train
abominable
ignorance
and
darkness
of
mind
a
corresponding
intolerance
discord
of
creeds
religious
wars
crusades
inquisitions
and
persecutions
as
the
form
of
fellowship
chivalry
compounded
of
savagery
and
folly
with
its
pedantic
system
of
ridiculous
false
pretences
carried
to
an
extreme
its
degrading
superstition
and
apish
veneration
for
women
gallantry
is
the
residue
of
this
veneration
deservedly
requited
as
it
is
by
feminine
arrogance
it
affords
continual
food
for
laughter
to
all
asiatics
and
the
greeks
would
have
joined
in
it
in
the
golden
middle
age
the
practice
developed
into
a
regular
and
methodical
service
of
women
it
imposed
deeds
of
heroism
bombastic
troubadour
songs
etc
although
it
is
to
be
observed
that
these
last
buffooneries
which
had
an
intellectual
side
were
chiefly
at
home
in
france
whereas
amongst
the
material
sluggish
germans
the
knights
distinguished
themselves
rather
by
drinking
and
stealing
they
were
good
at
boozing
and
filling
their
castles
with
plunder
though
in
the
courts
to
be
sure
there
was
no
lack
of
insipid
love
songs
what
caused
this
utter
transformation
migration
and
christianity
i
am
glad
you
reminded
me
of
it
migration
was
the
source
of
the
evil
christianity
the
dam
on
which
it
broke
it
was
chiefly
by
christianity
that
the
raw
wild
hordes
which
came
flooding
in
were
controlled
and
tamed
the
savage
man
must
first
of
all
learn
to
kneel
to
venerate
to
obey
after
that
he
can
be
civilized
this
was
done
in
ireland
by
patrick
in
germany
by
winifred
the
saxon
who
was
a
genuine
boniface
it
was
migration
of
peoples
the
last
advance
of
asiatic
races
towards
europe
followed
only
by
the
fruitless
attempts
of
those
under
attila
zenghis
khan
and
timur
and
as
a
comic
afterpiece
by
the
gipsies
it
was
this
movement
which
swept
away
the
humanity
of
the
ancients
christianity
was
precisely
the
principle
which
set
itself
to
work
against
this
savagery
just
as
later
through
the
whole
of
the
middle
age
the
church
and
its
hierarchy
were
most
necessary
to
set
limits
to
the
savage
barbarism
of
those
masters
of
violence
the
princes
and
knights
it
was
what
broke
up
the
icefloes
in
that
mighty
deluge
still
the
chief
aim
of
christianity
is
not
so
much
to
make
this
life
pleasant
as
to
render
us
worthy
of
a
better
it
looks
away
over
this
span
of
time
over
this
fleeting
dream
and
seeks
to
lead
us
to
eternal
welfare
its
tendency
is
ethical
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
a
sense
unknown
in
europe
till
its
advent
as
i
have
shown
you
by
putting
the
morality
and
religion
of
the
ancients
side
by
side
with
those
of
christendom
you
are
quite
right
as
regards
theory
but
look
at
the
practice
in
comparison
with
the
ages
of
christianity
the
ancient
world
was
unquestionably
less
cruel
than
the
middle
age
with
its
deaths
by
exquisite
torture
its
innumerable
burnings
at
the
stake
the
ancients
further
were
very
enduring
laid
great
stress
on
justice
frequently
sacrificed
themselves
for
their
country
showed
such
traces
of
every
kind
of
magnanimity
and
such
genuine
manliness
that
to
this
day
an
acquaintance
with
their
thoughts
and
actions
is
called
the
study
of
humanity
the
fruits
of
christianity
were
religious
wars
butcheries
crusades
inquisitions
extermination
of
the
natives
in
america
and
the
introduction
of
african
slaves
in
their
place
and
among
the
ancients
there
is
nothing
analogous
to
this
nothing
that
can
be
compared
with
it
for
the
slaves
of
the
ancients
the
the
were
a
contented
race
and
faithfully
devoted
to
their
masters
service
and
as
different
from
the
miserable
negroes
of
the
sugar
plantations
which
are
a
disgrace
to
humanity
as
their
two
colors
are
distinct
those
special
moral
delinquencies
for
which
we
reproach
the
ancients
and
which
are
perhaps
less
uncommon
than
appears
on
the
surface
to
be
the
case
are
trifles
compared
with
the
christian
enormities
i
have
mentioned
can
you
then
all
considered
maintain
that
mankind
has
been
really
made
morally
better
by
christianity
if
the
results
have
everywhere
been
in
keeping
with
the
purity
and
truth
of
the
doctrine
it
may
be
because
the
doctrine
has
been
too
noble
too
elevated
for
mankind
that
its
aim
has
been
placed
too
high
it
was
so
much
easier
to
come
up
to
the
heathen
system
or
to
the
mohammedan
it
is
precisely
what
is
noble
and
dignified
that
is
most
liable
everywhere
to
misuse
and
fraud
optimi
those
high
doctrines
have
accordingly
now
and
then
served
as
a
pretext
for
the
most
abominable
proceedings
and
for
acts
of
unmitigated
wickedness
the
downfall
of
the
institutions
of
the
old
world
as
well
as
of
its
arts
and
sciences
is
as
i
have
said
to
be
attributed
to
the
inroad
of
foreign
barbarians
the
inevitable
result
of
this
inroad
was
that
ignorance
and
savagery
got
the
upper
hand
consequently
violence
and
knavery
established
their
dominion
and
knights
and
priests
became
a
burden
to
mankind
it
is
partly
however
to
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
new
religion
made
eternal
and
not
temporal
welfare
the
object
of
desire
taught
that
simplicity
of
heart
was
to
be
preferred
to
knowledge
and
looked
askance
at
all
worldly
pleasure
now
the
arts
and
sciences
subserve
worldly
pleasure
but
in
so
far
as
they
could
be
made
serviceable
to
religion
they
were
promoted
and
attained
a
certain
degree
of
perfection
in
a
very
narrow
sphere
the
sciences
were
suspicious
companions
and
as
such
were
placed
under
restrictions
on
the
other
hand
darling
ignorance
that
element
so
necessary
to
a
system
of
faith
was
carefully
nourished
and
yet
mankind
possessions
in
the
way
of
knowledge
up
to
that
period
which
were
preserved
in
the
writings
of
the
ancients
were
saved
from
destruction
by
the
clergy
especially
by
those
in
the
monasteries
how
would
it
have
fared
if
christianity
had
come
in
just
before
the
migration
of
peoples
it
would
really
be
a
most
useful
inquiry
to
try
and
make
with
the
coldest
impartiality
an
unprejudiced
careful
and
accurate
comparison
of
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
which
may
be
put
down
to
religion
for
that
of
course
a
much
larger
knowledge
of
historical
and
psychological
data
than
either
of
us
command
would
be
necessary
academies
might
make
it
a
subject
for
a
prize
essay
they
take
good
care
not
to
do
so
i
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that
it
a
bad
look
out
for
religion
however
there
are
academies
which
in
proposing
a
subject
for
competition
make
it
a
secret
condition
that
the
prize
is
to
go
to
the
man
who
best
interprets
their
own
view
if
we
could
only
begin
by
getting
a
statistician
to
tell
us
how
many
crimes
are
prevented
every
year
by
religious
and
how
many
by
other
motives
there
would
be
very
few
of
the
former
if
a
man
feels
tempted
to
commit
a
crime
you
may
rely
upon
it
that
the
first
consideration
which
enters
his
head
is
the
penalty
appointed
for
it
and
the
chances
that
it
will
fall
upon
him
then
comes
as
a
second
consideration
the
risk
to
his
reputation
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
will
ruminate
by
the
hour
on
these
two
impediments
before
he
ever
takes
a
thought
of
religious
considerations
if
he
gets
safely
over
those
two
first
bulwarks
against
crime
i
think
religion
alone
will
very
rarely
hold
him
back
from
it
i
think
that
it
will
very
often
do
so
especially
when
its
influence
works
through
the
medium
of
custom
an
atrocious
act
is
at
once
felt
to
be
repulsive
what
is
this
but
the
effect
of
early
impressions
think
for
instance
how
often
a
man
especially
if
of
noble
birth
will
make
tremendous
sacrifices
to
perform
what
he
has
promised
motived
entirely
by
the
fact
that
his
father
has
often
earnestly
impressed
upon
him
in
his
childhood
that
a
man
of
honor
or
a
gentleman
or
a
a
cavalier
always
keeps
his
word
inviolate
that
no
use
unless
there
is
a
certain
inborn
honorableness
you
must
ascribe
to
religion
what
results
from
innate
goodness
of
character
by
which
compassion
for
the
man
who
would
suffer
by
his
crime
keeps
a
man
from
committing
it
this
is
the
genuine
moral
motive
and
as
such
it
is
independent
of
all
religions
but
this
is
a
motive
which
rarely
affects
the
multitude
unless
it
assumes
a
religious
aspect
the
religious
aspect
at
any
rate
strengthens
its
power
for
good
yet
without
any
such
natural
foundation
religious
motives
alone
are
powerful
to
prevent
crime
we
need
not
be
surprised
at
this
in
the
case
of
the
multitude
when
we
see
that
even
people
of
education
pass
now
and
then
under
the
influence
not
indeed
of
religious
motives
which
are
founded
on
something
which
is
at
least
allegorically
true
but
of
the
most
absurd
superstition
and
allow
themselves
to
be
guided
by
it
all
their
life
long
as
for
instance
undertaking
nothing
on
a
friday
refusing
to
sit
down
thirteen
at
a
table
obeying
chance
omens
and
the
like
how
much
more
likely
is
the
multitude
to
be
guided
by
such
things
you
ca
form
any
adequate
idea
of
the
narrow
limits
of
the
mind
in
its
raw
state
it
is
a
place
of
absolute
darkness
especially
when
as
often
happens
a
bad
unjust
and
malicious
heart
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
people
in
this
condition
and
they
form
the
great
bulk
of
humanity
must
be
led
and
controlled
as
well
as
may
be
even
if
it
be
by
really
superstitious
motives
until
such
time
as
they
become
susceptible
to
truer
and
better
ones
as
an
instance
of
the
direct
working
of
religion
may
be
cited
the
fact
common
enough
in
italy
especially
of
a
thief
restoring
stolen
goods
through
the
influence
of
his
confessor
who
says
he
wo
absolve
him
if
he
does
think
again
of
the
case
of
an
oath
where
religion
shows
a
most
decided
influence
whether
it
be
that
a
man
places
himself
expressly
in
the
position
of
a
purely
and
as
such
looks
upon
himself
as
solemnly
appealed
to
as
seems
to
be
the
case
in
france
where
the
formula
is
simply
le
and
also
among
the
quakers
whose
solemn
or
is
regarded
as
a
substitute
for
the
oath
or
whether
it
be
that
a
man
really
believes
he
is
pronouncing
something
which
may
affect
his
eternal
happiness
a
belief
which
is
presumably
only
the
investiture
of
the
former
feeling
at
any
rate
religious
considerations
are
a
means
of
awakening
and
calling
out
a
man
moral
nature
how
often
it
happens
that
a
man
agrees
to
take
a
false
oath
and
then
when
it
comes
to
the
point
suddenly
refuses
and
truth
and
right
win
the
day
oftener
still
false
oaths
are
really
taken
and
truth
and
right
trampled
under
foot
though
all
witnesses
of
the
oath
know
it
well
still
you
are
quite
right
to
quote
the
oath
as
an
undeniable
example
of
the
practical
efficacy
of
religion
but
in
spite
of
all
you
said
i
doubt
whether
the
efficacy
of
religion
goes
much
beyond
this
just
think
if
a
public
proclamation
were
suddenly
made
announcing
the
repeal
of
all
the
criminal
laws
i
fancy
neither
you
nor
i
would
have
the
courage
to
go
home
from
here
under
the
protection
of
religious
motives
if
in
the
same
way
all
religions
were
declared
untrue
we
could
under
the
protection
of
the
laws
alone
go
on
living
as
before
without
any
special
addition
to
our
apprehensions
or
our
measures
of
precaution
i
will
go
beyond
this
and
say
that
religions
have
very
frequently
exercised
a
decidedly
demoralizing
influence
one
may
say
generally
that
duties
towards
god
and
duties
towards
humanity
are
in
inverse
ratio
it
is
easy
to
let
adulation
of
the
deity
make
amends
for
lack
of
proper
behavior
towards
man
and
so
we
see
that
in
all
times
and
in
all
countries
the
great
majority
of
mankind
find
it
much
easier
to
beg
their
way
to
heaven
by
prayers
than
to
deserve
to
go
there
by
their
actions
in
every
religion
it
soon
comes
to
be
the
case
that
faith
ceremonies
rites
and
the
like
are
proclaimed
to
be
more
agreeable
to
the
divine
will
than
moral
actions
the
former
especially
if
they
are
bound
up
with
the
emoluments
of
the
clergy
gradually
come
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
substitute
for
the
latter
sacrifices
in
temples
the
saying
of
masses
the
founding
of
chapels
the
planting
of
crosses
by
the
roadside
soon
come
to
be
the
most
meritorious
works
so
that
even
great
crimes
are
expiated
by
them
as
also
by
penance
subjection
to
priestly
authority
confessions
pilgrimages
donations
to
the
temples
and
the
clergy
the
building
of
monasteries
and
the
like
the
consequence
of
all
this
is
that
the
priests
finally
appear
as
middlemen
in
the
corruption
of
the
gods
and
if
matters
do
go
quite
so
far
as
that
where
is
the
religion
whose
adherents
do
consider
prayers
praise
and
manifold
acts
of
devotion
a
substitute
at
least
in
part
for
moral
conduct
look
at
england
where
by
an
audacious
piece
of
priestcraft
the
christian
sunday
introduced
by
constantine
the
great
as
a
subject
for
the
jewish
sabbath
is
in
a
mendacious
way
identified
with
it
and
takes
its
name
and
this
in
order
that
the
commands
of
jehovah
for
the
sabbath
that
is
the
day
on
which
the
almighty
had
to
rest
from
his
six
days
labor
so
that
it
is
essentially
the
last
day
of
the
week
might
be
applied
to
the
christian
sunday
the
the
first
day
of
the
week
which
the
sun
opens
in
glory
the
day
of
devotion
and
joy
the
consequence
of
this
fraud
is
that
or
the
desecration
of
the
sabbath
that
is
the
slightest
occupation
whether
of
business
or
pleasure
all
games
music
sewing
worldly
books
are
on
sundays
looked
upon
as
great
sins
surely
the
ordinary
man
must
believe
that
if
as
his
spiritual
guides
impress
upon
him
he
is
only
constant
in
a
strict
observance
of
the
holy
sabbath
and
is
a
regular
attendant
at
divine
service
that
is
if
he
only
invariably
idles
away
his
time
on
sundays
and
does
fail
to
sit
two
hours
in
church
to
hear
the
same
litany
for
the
thousandth
time
and
mutter
it
in
tune
with
the
others
he
may
reckon
on
indulgence
in
regard
to
those
little
peccadilloes
which
he
occasionally
allows
himself
those
devils
in
human
form
the
slave
owners
and
slave
traders
in
the
free
states
of
north
america
they
should
be
called
the
slave
states
are
as
a
rule
orthodox
pious
anglicans
who
would
consider
it
a
grave
sin
to
work
on
sundays
and
having
confidence
in
this
and
their
regular
attendance
at
church
they
hope
for
eternal
happiness
the
demoralizing
tendency
of
religion
is
less
problematical
than
its
moral
influence
how
great
and
how
certain
that
moral
influence
must
be
to
make
amends
for
the
enormities
which
religions
especially
the
christian
and
mohammedan
religions
have
produced
and
spread
over
the
earth
think
of
the
fanaticism
the
endless
persecutions
the
religious
wars
that
sanguinary
frenzy
of
which
the
ancients
had
no
conception
think
of
the
crusades
a
butchery
lasting
two
hundred
years
and
inexcusable
its
war
cry
is
the
will
of
its
object
to
gain
possession
of
the
grave
of
one
who
preached
love
and
sufferance
think
of
the
cruel
expulsion
and
extermination
of
the
moors
and
jews
from
spain
think
of
the
orgies
of
blood
the
inquisitions
the
heretical
tribunals
the
bloody
and
terrible
conquests
of
the
mohammedans
in
three
continents
or
those
of
christianity
in
america
whose
inhabitants
were
for
the

upon

when
in

we

of

of
which
the
annual
number
appeared
in

shall
not
be
weary
of
bringing
old
news
to
mind
and
above
all
do
let
us
forget
india
the
cradle
of
the
human
race
or
at
least
of
that
part
of
it
to
which
we
belong
where
first
mohammedans
and
then
christians
were
most
cruelly
infuriated
against
the
adherents
of
the
original
faith
of
mankind
the
destruction
or
disfigurement
of
the
ancient
temples
and
idols
a
lamentable
mischievous
and
barbarous
act
still
bears
witness
to
the
monotheistic
fury
of
the
mohammedans
carried
on
from
marmud
the
ghaznevid
of
cursed
memory
down
to
aureng

the
fratricide
whom
the
portuguese
christians
have
zealously
imitated
by
destruction
of

and
the

of

at

do
let
us
forget
the
chosen
people
of
god
who
after
they
had
by
jehovah
express
command
stolen
from
their
old
and
trusty
friends
in
egypt
the
gold
and
silver
vessels
which
had
been
lent
to
them
made
a
murderous
and
plundering
inroad
into
the
promised
land
with
the
murderer

at
their
head
to
tear
it
from

rightful
owners
again
by
the

express
and
repeated
commands
showing
no
mercy
exterminating
the
inhabitants
women
children
and
all
joshua
ch
and
and
all
this
simply
because
they
were
circumcised
and
did
know
jehovah
which
was
reason
enough
to
justify
every
enormity
against
them
just
as
for
the
same
reason
in
earlier
times
the
infamous
knavery
of
the
patriarch
jacob
and
his
chosen
people
against
hamor
king
of

truly
it
is
the
worst
side
of
religions
that
the
believers
of
one
religion
have
allowed
themselves
every
sin
again
those
of
another
and
with
the
utmost
ruffianism
and
cruelty
persecuted
them
the
mohammedans
against
the
christians
and

the
christians
against
the
hindoos

american
natives

jews
heretics
and
others
perhaps
i
go
too
far
in
saying
religions
for
the
sake
of
truth
i
must
add
that
the
fanatical
enormities
perpetrated
in
the
name
of
religion
are
only
to
be
put
down
to
the
adherents
of
monotheistic
creeds
that
is
the
jewish
faith
and
its
two
branches
christianity
and
islamism
we
hear
of
nothing
of
the
kind
in
the
case
of
hindoos
and
buddhists
although
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
about
the
fifth
century
of
our
era
buddhism
was
driven
out
by
the
brahmans
from
its
ancient
home
in
the
southernmost
part
of
the
indian
peninsula
and
afterwards
spread
over
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
asia
as
far
as
i
know
we
have
no
definite
account
of
any
crimes
of
violence
or
wars
or
cruelties
perpetrated
in
the
course
of
it
that
may
of
course
be
attributable
to
the
obscurity
which
veils
the
history
of
those
countries
but
the
exceedingly
mild
character
of
their
religion
together
with
their
unceasing
inculcation
of
forbearance
towards
all
living
things
and
the
fact
that
brahmanism
by
its
caste
system
properly
admits
no
proselytes
allows
one
to
hope
that
their
adherents
may
be
acquitted
of
shedding
blood
on
a
large
scale
and
of
cruelty
in
any
form
spence
hardy
in
his
excellent
book
on
praises
the
extraordinary
tolerance
of
the
buddhists
and
adds
his
assurance
that
the
annals
of
buddhism
will
furnish
fewer
instances
of
religious
persecution
than
those
of
any
other
religion
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
only
to
monotheism
that
intolerance
is
essential
an
only
god
is
by
his
nature
a
jealous
god
who
can
allow
no
other
god
to
exist
polytheistic
gods
on
the
other
hand
are
naturally
tolerant
they
live
and
let
live
their
own
colleagues
are
the
chief
objects
of
their
sufferance
as
being
gods
of
the
same
religion
this
toleration
is
afterwards
extended
to
foreign
gods
who
are
accordingly
hospitably
received
and
later
on
admitted
in
some
cases
to
an
equality
of
rights
the
chief
example
of
which
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
romans
willingly
admitted
and
venerated
phrygian
egyptian
and
other
gods
hence
it
is
that
monotheistic
religions
alone
furnish
the
spectacle
of
religious
wars
religious
persecutions
heretical
tribunals
that
breaking
of
idols
and
destruction
of
images
of
the
gods
that
razing
of
indian
temples
and
egyptian
colossi
which
had
looked
on
the
sun
three
thousand
years
just
because
a
jealous
god
had
said
shalt
make
no
graven
but
to
return
to
the
chief
point
you
are
certainly
right
in
insisting
on
the
strong
metaphysical
needs
of
mankind
but
religion
appears
to
me
to
be
not
so
much
a
satisfaction
as
an
abuse
of
those
needs
at
any
rate
we
have
seen
that
in
regard
to
the
furtherance
of
morality
its
utility
is
for
the
most
part
problematical
its
disadvantages
and
especially
the
atrocities
which
have
followed
in
its
train
are
patent
to
the
light
of
day
of
course
it
is
quite
a
different
matter
if
we
consider
the
utility
of
religion
as
a
prop
of
thrones
for
where
these
are
held
by
the
grace
of
god
throne
and
altar
are
intimately
associated
and
every
wise
prince
who
loves
his
throne
and
his
family
will
appear
at
the
head
of
his
people
as
an
exemplar
of
true
religion
even
machiavelli
in
the
eighteenth
chapter
of
his
book
most
earnestly
recommended
religion
to
princes
beyond
this
one
may
say
that
revealed
religions
stand
to
philosophy
exactly
in
the
relation
of
sovereigns
by
the
grace
of
god
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
so
that
the
two
former
terms
of
the
parallel
are
in
natural
alliance
oh
do
take
that
tone
you
going
hand
in
hand
with
ochlocracy
and
anarchy
the
arch
enemy
of
all
legislative
order
all
civilization
and
all
humanity
you
are
right
it
was
only
a
sophism
of
mine
what
the
fencing
master
calls
a
feint
i
retract
it
but
see
how
disputing
sometimes
makes
an
honest
man
unjust
and
malicious
let
us
stop
i
ca
help
regretting
that
after
all
the
trouble
taken
i
have
altered
your
disposition
in
regard
to
religion
on
the
other
hand
i
can
assure
you
that
everything
you
have
said
has
shaken
my
conviction
of
its
high
value
and
necessity
i
fully
believe
you
for
as
we
may
read
in
hudibras
a
man
convinced
against
his
will
is
of
the
same
opinion
still
my
consolation
is
that
alike
in
controversies
and
in
taking
mineral
waters
the
after
effects
are
the
true
ones
well
i
hope
it
be
beneficial
in
your
case
it
might
be
so
if
i
could
digest
a
certain
spanish
proverb
which
is
behind
the
cross
stands
the
come
do
let
us
part
with
sarcasms
let
us
rather
admit
that
religion
like
janus
or
better
still
like
the
brahman
god
of
death
yama
has
two
faces
and
like
him
one
friendly
the
other
sullen
each
of
us
has
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
one
alone
you
are
right
old
fellow
a
few
words
on
pantheism
the
controversy
between
theism
and
pantheism
might
be
presented
in
an
allegorical
or
dramatic
form
by
supposing
a
dialogue
between
two
persons
in
the
pit
of
a
theatre
at
milan
during
the
performance
of
a
piece
one
of
them
convinced
that
he
is
in
girolamo
renowned
admires
the
art
by
which
the
director
gets
up
the
dolls
and
guides
their
movements
oh
you
are
quite
mistaken
says
the
other
we
in
the
teatro
della
scala
it
is
the
manager
and
his
troupe
who
are
on
the
stage
they
are
the
persons
you
see
before
you
the
poet
too
is
taking
a
part
the
chief
objection
i
have
to
pantheism
is
that
it
says
nothing
to
call
the
world
god
is
not
to
explain
it
it
is
only
to
enrich
our
language
with
a
superfluous
synonym
for
the
word
world
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
whether
you
say
the
world
is
god
or
god
is
the
world
but
if
you
start
from
god
as
something
that
is
given
in
experience
and
has
to
be
explained
and
they
say
god
is
the
world
you
are
affording
what
is
to
some
extent
an
explanation
in
so
far
as
you
are
reducing
what
is
unknown
to
what
is
partly
known
per
but
it
is
only
a
verbal
explanation
if
however
you
start
from
what
is
really
given
that
is
to
say
from
the
world
and
say
the
world
is
god
it
is
clear
that
you
say
nothing
or
at
least
you
are
explaining
what
is
unknown
by
what
is
more
unknown
hence
pantheism
presupposes
theism
only
in
so
far
as
you
start
from
a
god
that
is
in
so
far
as
you
possess
him
as
something
with
which
you
are
already
familiar
can
you
end
by
identifying
him
with
the
world
and
your
purpose
in
doing
so
is
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
in
a
decent
fashion
in
other
words
you
do
not
start
clear
from
the
world
as
something
that
requires
explanation
you
start
from
god
as
something
that
is
given
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
him
you
make
the
world
take
over
his
role
this
is
the
origin
of
pantheism
taking
an
unprejudiced
view
of
the
world
as
it
is
no
one
would
dream
of
regarding
it
as
a
god
it
must
be
a
very
god
who
knows
no
better
way
of
diverting
himself
than
by
turning
into
such
a
world
as
ours
such
a
mean
shabby
world
there
to
take
the
form
of
innumerable
millions
who
live
indeed
but
are
fretted
and
tormented
and
who
manage
to
exist
a
while
together
only
by
preying
on
one
another
to
bear
misery
need
and
death
without
measure
and
without
object
in
the
form
for
instance
of
millions
of
negro
slaves
or
of
the
three
million
weavers
in
europe
who
in
hunger
and
care
lead
a
miserable
existence
in
damp
rooms
or
the
cheerless
halls
of
a
factory
what
a
pastime
this
for
a
god
who
must
as
such
be
used
to
another
mode
of
existence
we
find
accordingly
that
what
is
described
as
the
great
advance
from
theism
to
pantheism
if
looked
at
seriously
and
not
simply
as
a
masked
negation
of
the
sort
indicated
above
is
a
transition
from
what
is
unproved
and
hardly
conceivable
to
what
is
absolutely
absurd
for
however
obscure
however
loose
or
confused
may
be
the
idea
which
we
connect
with
the
word
god
there
are
two
predicates
which
are
inseparable
from
it
the
highest
power
and
the
highest
wisdom
it
is
absolutely
absurd
to
think
that
a
being
endowed
with
these
qualities
should
have
put
himself
into
the
position
described
above
theism
on
the
other
hand
is
something
which
is
merely
unproved
and
if
it
is
difficult
to
look
upon
the
infinite
world
as
the
work
of
a
personal
and
therefore
individual
being
the
like
of
which
we
know
only
from
our
experience
of
the
animal
world
it
is
nevertheless
not
an
absolutely
absurd
idea
that
a
being
at
once
almighty
and
should
create
a
world
of
torment
is
always
conceivable
even
though
we
do
not
know
why
he
does
so
and
accordingly
we
find
that
when
people
ascribe
the
height
of
goodness
to
this
being
they
set
up
the
inscrutable
nature
of
his
wisdom
as
the
refuge
by
which
the
doctrine
escapes
the
charge
of
absurdity
pantheism
however
assumes
that
the
creative
god
is
himself
the
world
of
infinite
torment
and
in
this
little
world
alone
dies
every
second
and
that
entirely
of
his
own
will
which
is
absurd
it
would
be
much
more
correct
to
identify
the
world
with
the
devil
as
the
venerable
author
of
the
has
in
fact
done
in
a
passage
of
his
immortal
work
where
he
says
the
evil
spirit
and
nature
are
one
and
where
nature
is
not
overcome
neither
is
the
evil
adversary
it
is
manifest
that
the
pantheists
give
the
sansara
the
name
of
god
the
same
name
is
given
by
the
mystics
to
the
nirvana
the
latter
however
state
more
about
the
nirvana
than
they
know
which
is
not
done
by
the
buddhists
whose
nirvana
is
accordingly
a
relative
nothing
it
is
only
jews
christians
and
mohammedans
who
give
its
proper
and
correct
meaning
to
the
word
god
the
expression
often
heard
the
world
is
an
leaves
it
uncertain
whether
pantheism
or
a
simple
fatalism
is
to
be
taken
as
the
explanation
of
it
but
whichever
it
be
the
expression
looks
upon
the
world
from
a
physical
point
of
view
only
and
leaves
out
of
sight
its
moral
significance
because
you
can
not
assume
a
moral
significance
without
presenting
the
world
as
means
to
a
higher
end
the
notion
that
the
world
has
a
physical
but
not
a
moral
meaning
is
the
most
mischievous
error
sprung
from
the
greatest
mental
perversity
on
books
and
reading
ignorance
is
degrading
only
when
found
in
company
with
riches
the
poor
man
is
restrained
by
poverty
and
need
labor
occupies
his
thoughts
and
takes
the
place
of
knowledge
but
rich
men
who
are
ignorant
live
for
their
lusts
only
and
are
like
the
beasts
of
the
field
as
may
be
seen
every
day
and
they
can
also
be
reproached
for
not
having
used
wealth
and
leisure
for
that
which
gives
them
their
greatest
value
when
we
read
another
person
thinks
for
us
we
merely
repeat
his
mental
process
in
learning
to
write
the
pupil
goes
over
with
his
pen
what
the
teacher
has
outlined
in
pencil
so
in
reading
the
greater
part
of
the
work
of
thought
is
already
done
for
us
this
is
why
it
relieves
us
to
take
up
a
book
after
being
occupied
with
our
own
thoughts
and
in
reading
the
mind
is
in
fact
only
the
playground
of
thoughts
so
it
comes
about
that
if
anyone
spends
almost
the
whole
day
in
reading
and
by
way
of
relaxation
devotes
the
intervals
to
some
thoughtless
pastime
he
gradually
loses
the
capacity
for
thinking
just
as
the
man
who
always
rides
at
last
forgets
how
to
walk
this
is
the
case
with
many
learned
persons
they
have
read
themselves
stupid
for
to
occupy
every
spare
moment
in
reading
and
to
do
nothing
but
read
is
even
more
paralyzing
to
the
mind
than
constant
manual
labor
which
at
least
allows
those
engaged
in
it
to
follow
their
own
thoughts
a
spring
never
free
from
the
pressure
of
some
foreign
body
at
last
loses
its
elasticity
and
so
does
the
mind
if
other
people
thoughts
are
constantly
forced
upon
it
just
as
you
can
ruin
the
stomach
and
impair
the
whole
body
by
taking
too
much
nourishment
so
you
can
overfill
and
choke
the
mind
by
feeding
it
too
much
the
more
you
read
the
fewer
are
the
traces
left
by
what
you
have
read
the
mind
becomes
like
a
tablet
crossed
over
and
over
with
writing
there
is
no
time
for
ruminating
and
in
no
other
way
can
you
assimilate
what
you
have
read
if
you
read
on
and
on
without
setting
your
own
thoughts
to
work
what
you
have
read
can
not
strike
root
and
is
generally
lost
it
is
in
fact
just
the
same
with
mental
as
with
bodily
food
hardly
the
fifth
part
of
what
one
takes
is
assimilated
the
rest
passes
off
in
evaporation
respiration
and
the
like
the
result
of
all
this
is
that
thoughts
put
on
paper
are
nothing
more
than
footsteps
in
the
sand
you
see
the
way
the
man
has
gone
but
to
know
what
he
saw
on
his
walk
you
want
his
eyes
there
is
no
quality
of
style
that
can
be
gained
by
reading
writers
who
possess
it
whether
it
be
persuasiveness
imagination
the
gift
of
drawing
comparisons
boldness
bitterness
brevity
grace
ease
of
expression
or
wit
unexpected
contrasts
a
laconic
or
naive
manner
and
the
like
but
if
these
qualities
are
already
in
us
exist
that
is
to
say
potentially
we
can
call
them
forth
and
bring
them
to
consciousness
we
can
learn
the
purposes
to
which
they
can
be
put
we
can
be
strengthened
in
our
inclination
to
use
them
or
get
courage
to
do
so
we
can
judge
by
examples
the
effect
of
applying
them
and
so
acquire
the
correct
use
of
them
and
of
course
it
is
only
when
we
have
arrived
at
that
point
that
we
actually
possess
these
qualities
the
only
way
in
which
reading
can
form
style
is
by
teaching
us
the
use
to
which
we
can
put
our
own
natural
gifts
we
must
have
these
gifts
before
we
begin
to
learn
the
use
of
them
without
them
reading
teaches
us
nothing
but
cold
dead
mannerisms
and
makes
us
shallow
imitators
the
strata
of
the
earth
preserve
in
rows
the
creatures
which
lived
in
former
ages
and
the
array
of
books
on
the
shelves
of
a
library
stores
up
in
like
manner
the
errors
of
the
past
and
the
way
in
which
they
have
been
exposed
like
those
creatures
they
too
were
full
of
life
in
their
time
and
made
a
great
deal
of
noise
but
now
they
are
stiff
and
fossilized
and
an
object
of
curiosity
to
the
literary
palaeontologist
alone
herodotus
relates
that
xerxes
wept
at
the
sight
of
his
army
which
stretched
further
than
the
eye
could
reach
in
the
thought
that
of
all
these
after
a
hundred
years
not
one
would
be
alive
and
in
looking
over
a
huge
catalogue
of
new
books
one
might
weep
at
thinking
that
when
ten
years
have
passed
not
one
of
them
will
be
heard
of
it
is
in
literature
as
in
life
wherever
you
turn
you
stumble
at
once
upon
the
incorrigible
mob
of
humanity
swarming
in
all
directions
crowding
and
soiling
everything
like
flies
in
summer
hence
the
number
which
no
man
can
count
of
bad
books
those
rank
weeds
of
literature
which
draw
nourishment
from
the
corn
and
choke
it
the
time
money
and
attention
of
the
public
which
rightfully
belong
to
good
books
and
their
noble
aims
they
take
for
themselves
they
are
written
for
the
mere
purpose
of
making
money
or
procuring
places
so
they
are
not
only
useless
they
do
positive
mischief
of
the
whole
of
our
present
literature
has
no
other
aim
than
to
get
a
few
shillings
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
public
and
to
this
end
author
publisher
and
reviewer
are
in
league
let
me
mention
a
crafty
and
wicked
trick
albeit
a
profitable
and
successful
one
practised
by
littérateurs
hack
writers
and
voluminous
authors
in
complete
disregard
of
good
taste
and
the
true
culture
of
the
period
they
have
succeeded
in
getting
the
whole
of
the
world
of
fashion
into
leading
strings
so
that
they
are
all
trained
to
read
in
time
and
all
the
same
thing
newest
and
that
for
the
purpose
of
getting
food
for
conversation
in
the
circles
in
which
they
move
this
is
the
aim
served
by
bad
novels
produced
by
writers
who
were
once
celebrated
as
spindler
bulwer
lytton
eugene
sue
what
can
be
more
miserable
than
the
lot
of
a
reading
public
like
this
always
bound
to
peruse
the
latest
works
of
extremely
commonplace
persons
who
write
for
money
only
and
who
are
therefore
never
few
in
number
and
for
this
advantage
they
are
content
to
know
by
name
only
the
works
of
the
few
superior
minds
of
all
ages
and
all
countries
literary
newspapers
too
are
a
singularly
cunning
device
for
robbing
the
reading
public
of
the
time
which
if
culture
is
to
be
attained
should
be
devoted
to
the
genuine
productions
of
literature
instead
of
being
occupied
by
the
daily
bungling
commonplace
persons
hence
in
regard
to
reading
it
is
a
very
important
thing
to
be
able
to
refrain
skill
in
doing
so
consists
in
not
taking
into
one
hands
any
book
merely
because
at
the
time
it
happens
to
be
extensively
read
such
as
political
or
religious
pamphlets
novels
poetry
and
the
like
which
make
a
noise
and
may
even
attain
to
several
editions
in
the
first
and
last
year
of
their
existence
consider
rather
that
the
man
who
writes
for
fools
is
always
sure
of
a
large
audience
be
careful
to
limit
your
time
for
reading
and
devote
it
exclusively
to
the
works
of
those
great
minds
of
all
times
and
countries
who
the
rest
of
humanity
those
whom
the
voice
of
fame
points
to
as
such
these
alone
really
educate
and
instruct
you
can
never
read
bad
literature
too
little
nor
good
literature
too
much
bad
books
are
intellectual
poison
they
destroy
the
mind
because
people
always
read
what
is
new
instead
of
the
best
of
all
ages
writers
remain
in
the
narrow
circle
of
the
ideas
which
happen
to
prevail
in
their
time
and
so
the
period
sinks
deeper
and
deeper
into
its
own
mire
there
are
at
all
times
two
literatures
in
progress
running
side
by
side
but
little
known
to
each
other
the
one
real
the
other
only
apparent
the
former
grows
into
permanent
literature
it
is
pursued
by
those
who
live
science
or
poetry
its
course
is
sober
and
quiet
but
extremely
slow
and
it
produces
in
europe
scarcely
a
dozen
works
in
a
century
these
however
are
permanent
the
other
kind
is
pursued
by
persons
who
live
science
or
poetry
it
goes
at
a
gallop
with
much
noise
and
shouting
of
partisans
and
every
puts
a
thousand
works
on
the
market
but
after
a
few
years
one
asks
where
are
they
where
is
the
glory
which
came
so
soon
and
made
so
much
clamor
this
kind
may
be
called
fleeting
and
the
other
permanent
literature
in
the
history
of
politics
half
a
century
is
always
a
considerable
time
the
matter
which
goes
to
form
them
is
ever
on
the
move
there
is
always
something
going
on
but
in
the
history
of
literature
there
is
often
a
complete
standstill
for
the
same
period
nothing
has
happened
for
clumsy
attempts
do
count
you
are
just
where
you
were
fifty
years
previously
to
explain
what
i
mean
let
me
compare
the
advance
of
knowledge
among
mankind
to
the
course
taken
by
a
planet
the
false
paths
on
which
humanity
usually
enters
after
every
important
advance
are
like
the
epicycles
in
the
ptolemaic
system
and
after
passing
through
one
of
them
the
world
is
just
where
it
was
before
it
entered
it
but
the
great
minds
who
really
bring
the
race
further
on
its
course
do
not
accompany
it
on
the
epicycles
it
makes
from
time
to
time
this
explains
why
posthumous
fame
is
often
bought
at
the
expense
of
contemporary
praise
and
an
instance
of
such
an
epicycle
is
the
philosophy
started
by
fichte
and
schelling
and
crowned
by
hegel
caricature
of
it
this
epicycle
was
a
deviation
from
the
limit
to
which
philosophy
had
been
ultimately
brought
by
kant
and
at
that
point
i
took
it
up
again
afterwards
to
carry
it
further
in
the
intervening
period
the
sham
philosophers
i
have
mentioned
and
some
others
went
through
their
epicycle
which
had
just
come
to
an
end
so
that
those
who
went
with
them
on
their
course
are
conscious
of
the
fact
that
they
are
exactly
at
the
point
from
which
they
started
this
circumstance
explains
why
it
is
that
every
thirty
years
or
so
science
literature
and
art
as
expressed
in
the
spirit
of
the
time
are
declared
bankrupt
the
errors
which
appear
from
time
to
time
amount
to
such
a
height
in
that
period
that
the
mere
weight
of
their
absurdity
makes
the
fabric
fall
whilst
the
opposition
to
them
has
been
gathering
force
at
the
same
time
so
an
upset
takes
place
often
followed
by
an
error
in
the
opposite
direction
to
exhibit
these
movements
in
their
periodical
return
would
be
the
true
practical
aim
of
the
history
of
literature
little
attention
however
is
paid
to
it
and
besides
the
comparatively
short
duration
of
these
periods
makes
it
difficult
to
collect
the
data
of
epochs
long
gone
by
so
that
it
is
most
convenient
to
observe
how
the
matter
stands
in
one
own
generation
an
instance
of
this
tendency
drawn
from
physical
science
is
supplied
in
the
neptunian
geology
of
werter
but
let
me
keep
strictly
to
the
example
cited
above
the
nearest
we
can
take
in
german
philosophy
the
brilliant
epoch
of
kant
was
immediately
followed
by
a
period
which
aimed
rather
at
being
imposing
than
at
convincing
instead
of
being
thorough
and
clear
it
tried
to
be
dazzling
hyperbolical
and
in
a
special
degree
unintelligible
instead
of
seeking
truth
it
intrigued
philosophy
could
make
no
progress
in
this
fashion
and
at
last
the
whole
school
and
its
method
became
bankrupt
for
the
effrontery
of
hegel
and
his
fellows
came
to
such
a
pass
whether
because
they
talked
such
sophisticated
nonsense
or
were
so
unscrupulously
puffed
or
because
the
entire
aim
of
this
pretty
piece
of
work
was
quite
obvious
that
in
the
end
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
charlatanry
of
the
whole
business
from
becoming
manifest
to
everybody
and
when
in
consequence
of
certain
disclosures
the
favor
it
had
enjoyed
in
high
quarters
was
withdrawn
the
system
was
openly
ridiculed
this
most
miserable
of
all
the
meagre
philosophies
that
have
ever
existed
came
to
grief
and
dragged
down
with
it
into
the
abysm
of
discredit
the
systems
of
fichte
and
schelling
which
had
preceded
it
and
so
as
far
as
germany
is
concerned
the
total
philosophical
incompetence
of
the
first
half
of
the
century
following
upon
kant
is
quite
plain
and
still
the
germans
boast
of
their
talent
for
philosophy
in
comparison
with
foreigners
especially
since
an
english
writer
has
been
so
maliciously
ironical
as
to
call
them
a
nation
of
thinkers
for
an
example
of
the
general
system
of
epicycles
drawn
from
the
history
of
art
look
at
the
school
of
sculpture
which
flourished
in
the
last
century
and
took
its
name
from
bernini
more
especially
at
the
development
of
it
which
prevailed
in
france
the
ideal
of
this
school
was
not
antique
beauty
but
commonplace
nature
instead
of
the
simplicity
and
grace
of
ancient
art
it
represented
the
manners
of
a
french
minuet
this
tendency
became
bankrupt
when
under
winkelman
direction
a
return
was
made
to
the
antique
school
the
history
of
painting
furnishes
an
illustration
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
century
when
art
was
looked
upon
merely
as
a
means
and
instrument
of
mediaeval
religious
sentiment
and
its
themes
consequently
drawn
from
ecclesiastical
subjects
alone
these
however
were
treated
by
painters
who
had
none
of
the
true
earnestness
of
faith
and
in
their
delusion
they
followed
francesco
francia
pietro
perugino
angelico
da
fiesole
and
others
like
them
rating
them
higher
even
than
the
really
great
masters
who
followed
it
was
in
view
of
this
terror
and
because
in
poetry
an
analogous
aim
had
at
the
same
time
found
favor
that
goethe
wrote
his
parable
this
school
too
got
the
reputation
of
being
whimsical
became
bankrupt
and
was
followed
by
a
return
to
nature
which
proclaimed
itself
in
pictures
and
scenes
of
life
of
every
kind
even
though
it
now
and
then
strayed
into
what
was
vulgar
the
progress
of
the
human
mind
in
literature
is
similar
the
history
of
literature
is
for
the
most
part
like
the
catalogue
of
a
museum
of
deformities
the
spirit
in
which
they
keep
best
is
pigskin
the
few
creatures
that
have
been
born
in
goodly
shape
need
not
be
looked
for
there
they
are
still
alive
and
are
everywhere
to
be
met
with
in
the
world
immortal
and
with
their
years
ever
green
they
alone
form
what
i
have
called
real
literature
the
history
of
which
poor
as
it
is
in
persons
we
learn
from
our
youth
up
out
of
the
mouths
of
all
educated
people
before
compilations
recount
it
for
us
as
an
antidote
to
the
prevailing
monomania
for
reading
literary
histories
in
order
to
be
able
to
chatter
about
everything
without
having
any
real
knowledge
at
all
let
me
refer
to
a
passage
in
lichtenberg
works
vol
which
is
well
worth
perusal
i
believe
that
the
acquaintance
with
the
history
of
science
and
learning
which
is
such
a
prevalent
feature
of
our
day
is
very
prejudicial
to
the
advance
of
knowledge
itself
there
is
pleasure
in
following
up
this
history
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
leaves
the
mind
not
empty
indeed
but
without
any
power
of
its
own
just
because
it
makes
it
so
full
whoever
has
felt
the
desire
not
to
fill
up
his
mind
but
to
strengthen
it
to
develop
his
faculties
and
aptitudes
and
generally
to
enlarge
his
powers
will
have
found
that
there
is
nothing
so
weakening
as
intercourse
with
a
littérateur
on
a
matter
of
knowledge
on
which
he
has
not
thought
at
all
though
he
knows
a
thousand
little
facts
appertaining
to
its
history
and
literature
it
is
like
reading
a
when
you
are
hungry
i
believe
that
literary
history
will
never
thrive
amongst
thoughtful
people
who
are
conscious
of
their
own
worth
and
the
worth
of
real
knowledge
these
people
are
more
given
to
employing
their
own
reason
than
to
troubling
themselves
to
know
how
others
have
employed
theirs
the
worst
of
it
is
that
as
you
will
find
the
more
knowledge
takes
the
direction
of
literary
research
the
less
the
power
of
promoting
knowledge
becomes
the
only
thing
that
increases
is
pride
in
the
possession
of
it
such
persons
believe
that
they
possess
knowledge
in
a
greater
degree
than
those
who
really
possess
it
it
is
surely
a
remark
that
knowledge
never
makes
its
possessor
proud
those
alone
let
themselves
be
blown
out
with
pride
who
incapable
of
extending
knowledge
in
their
own
persons
occupy
themselves
with
clearing
up
dark
points
in
its
history
or
are
able
to
recount
what
others
have
done
they
are
proud
because
they
consider
this
occupation
which
is
mostly
of
a
mechanical
nature
the
practice
of
knowledge
i
could
illustrate
what
i
mean
by
examples
but
it
would
be
an
odious
task
still
i
wish
some
one
would
attempt
a
history
of
literature
giving
the
way
in
which
the
writers
and
artists
who
form
the
proudest
possession
of
the
various
nations
which
have
given
them
birth
have
been
treated
by
them
during
their
lives
such
a
history
would
exhibit
the
ceaseless
warfare
which
what
was
good
and
genuine
in
all
times
and
countries
has
had
to
wage
with
what
was
bad
and
perverse
it
would
tell
of
the
martyrdom
of
almost
all
those
who
truly
enlightened
humanity
of
almost
all
the
great
masters
of
every
kind
of
art
it
would
show
us
how
with
few
exceptions
they
were
tormented
to
death
without
recognition
without
sympathy
without
followers
how
they
lived
in
poverty
and
misery
whilst
fame
honor
and
riches
were
the
lot
of
the
unworthy
how
their
fate
was
that
of
esau
who
while
he
was
hunting
and
getting
venison
for
his
father
was
robbed
of
the
blessing
by
jacob
disguised
in
his
brother
clothes
how
in
spite
of
all
they
were
kept
up
by
the
love
of
their
work
until
at
last
the
bitter
fight
of
the
teacher
of
humanity
is
over
until
the
immortal
laurel
is
held
out
to
him
and
the
hour
strikes
when
it
can
be
said
der
sehwere
panzer
wird
zum
flügelkleide
kurz
ist
der
schmerz
unendlich
ist
die
freude
physiognomy
that
the
outer
man
is
a
picture
of
the
inner
and
the
face
an
expression
and
revelation
of
the
whole
character
is
a
presumption
likely
enough
in
itself
and
therefore
a
safe
one
to
go
by
evidenced
as
it
is
by
the
fact
that
people
are
always
anxious
to
see
anyone
who
has
made
himself
famous
by
good
or
evil
or
as
the
author
of
some
extraordinary
work
or
if
they
can
not
get
a
sight
of
him
to
hear
at
any
rate
from
others
what
he
looks
like
so
people
go
to
places
where
they
may
expect
to
see
the
person
who
interests
them
the
press
especially
in
england
endeavors
to
give
a
minute
and
striking
description
of
his
appearance
painters
and
engravers
lose
no
time
in
putting
him
visibly
before
us
and
finally
photography
on
that
very
account
of
such
high
value
affords
the
most
complete
satisfaction
of
our
curiosity
it
is
also
a
fact
that
in
private
life
everyone
criticises
the
physiognomy
of
those
he
comes
across
first
of
all
secretly
trying
to
discern
their
intellectual
and
moral
character
from
their
features
this
would
be
a
useless
proceeding
if
as
some
foolish
people
fancy
the
exterior
of
a
man
is
a
matter
of
no
account
if
as
they
think
the
soul
is
one
thing
and
the
body
another
and
the
body
related
to
the
soul
merely
as
the
coat
to
the
man
himself
on
the
contrary
every
human
face
is
a
hieroglyphic
and
a
hieroglyphic
too
which
admits
of
being
deciphered
the
alphabet
of
which
we
carry
about
with
us
already
perfected
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
face
of
a
man
gives
us
a
fuller
and
more
interesting
information
than
his
tongue
for
his
face
is
the
compendium
of
all
he
will
ever
say
as
it
is
the
one
record
of
all
his
thoughts
and
endeavors
and
moreover
the
tongue
tells
the
thought
of
one
man
only
whereas
the
face
expresses
a
thought
of
nature
itself
so
that
everyone
is
worth
attentive
observation
even
though
everyone
may
not
be
worth
talking
to
and
if
every
individual
is
worth
observation
as
a
single
thought
of
nature
how
much
more
so
is
beauty
since
it
is
a
higher
and
more
general
conception
of
nature
is
in
fact
her
thought
of
a
species
this
is
why
beauty
is
so
captivating
it
is
a
fundamental
thought
of
nature
whereas
the
individual
is
only
a
a
corollary
in
private
people
always
proceed
upon
the
principle
that
a
man
is
what
he
looks
and
the
principle
is
a
right
one
only
the
difficulty
lies
in
its
application
for
though
the
art
of
applying
the
principle
is
partly
innate
and
may
be
partly
gained
by
experience
no
one
is
a
master
of
it
and
even
the
most
experienced
is
not
infallible
but
for
all
that
whatever
figaro
may
say
it
is
not
the
face
which
deceives
it
is
we
who
deceive
ourselves
in
reading
in
it
what
is
not
there
the
deciphering
of
a
face
is
certainly
a
great
and
difficult
art
and
the
principles
of
it
can
never
be
learnt
in
the
abstract
the
first
condition
of
success
is
to
maintain
a
purely
objective
point
of
view
which
is
no
easy
matter
for
as
soon
as
the
faintest
trace
of
anything
subjective
is
present
whether
dislike
or
favor
or
fear
or
hope
or
even
the
thought
of
the
impression
we
ourselves
are
making
upon
the
object
of
our
attention
the
characters
we
are
trying
to
decipher
become
confused
and
corrupt
the
sound
of
a
language
is
really
appreciated
only
by
one
who
does
not
understand
it
and
that
because
in
thinking
of
the
signification
of
a
word
we
pay
no
regard
to
the
sign
itself
so
in
the
same
way
a
physiognomy
is
correctly
gauged
only
by
one
to
whom
it
is
still
strange
who
has
not
grown
accustomed
to
the
face
by
constantly
meeting
and
conversing
with
the
man
himself
it
is
therefore
strictly
speaking
only
the
first
sight
of
a
man
which
affords
that
purely
objective
view
which
is
necessary
for
deciphering
his
features
an
odor
affects
us
only
when
we
first
come
in
contact
with
it
and
the
first
glass
of
wine
is
the
one
which
gives
us
its
true
taste
in
the
same
way
it
is
only
at
the
first
encounter
that
a
face
makes
its
full
impression
upon
us
consequently
the
first
impression
should
be
carefully
attended
to
and
noted
even
written
down
if
the
subject
of
it
is
of
personal
importance
provided
of
course
that
one
can
trust
one
own
sense
of
physiognomy
subsequent
acquaintance
and
intercourse
will
obliterate
the
impression
but
time
will
one
day
prove
whether
it
is
true
let
us
however
not
conceal
from
ourselves
the
fact
that
this
first
impression
is
for
the
most
part
extremely
unedifying
how
poor
most
faces
are
with
the
exception
of
those
that
are
beautiful
or
intellectual
that
is
to
say
the
very
few
and
far
between
i
believe
a
person
of
any
fine
feeling
scarcely
ever
sees
a
new
face
without
a
sensation
akin
to
a
shock
for
the
reason
that
it
presents
a
new
and
surprising
combination
of
unedifying
elements
to
tell
the
truth
it
is
as
a
rule
a
sorry
sight
there
are
some
people
whose
faces
bear
the
stamp
of
such
artless
vulgarity
and
baseness
of
character
such
an
animal
limitation
of
intelligence
that
one
wonders
how
they
can
appear
in
public
with
such
a
countenance
instead
of
wearing
a
mask
there
are
faces
indeed
the
very
sight
of
which
produces
a
feeling
of
pollution
one
can
not
therefore
take
it
amiss
of
people
whose
privileged
position
admits
of
it
if
they
manage
to
live
in
retirement
and
completely
free
from
the
painful
sensation
of
seeing
new
faces
the
metaphysical
explanation
of
this
circumstance
rests
upon
the
consideration
that
the
individuality
of
a
man
is
precisely
that
by
the
very
existence
of
which
he
should
be
reclaimed
and
corrected
if
on
the
other
hand
a
psychological
explanation
is
satisfactory
let
any
one
ask
himself
what
kind
of
physiognomy
he
may
expect
in
those
who
have
all
their
life
long
except
on
the
rarest
occasions
harbored
nothing
but
petty
base
and
miserable
thoughts
and
vulgar
selfish
envious
wicked
and
malicious
desires
every
one
of
these
thoughts
and
desires
has
set
its
mark
upon
the
face
during
the
time
it
lasted
and
by
constant
repetition
all
these
marks
have
in
course
of
time
become
furrows
and
blotches
so
to
speak
consequently
most
people
appearance
is
such
as
to
produce
a
shock
at
first
sight
and
it
is
only
gradually
that
one
gets
accustomed
to
it
that
is
to
say
becomes
so
deadened
to
the
impression
that
it
has
no
more
effect
on
one
and
that
the
prevailing
facial
expression
is
the
result
of
a
long
process
of
innumerable
fleeting
and
characteristic
contractions
of
the
features
is
just
the
reason
why
intellectual
countenances
are
of
gradual
formation
it
is
indeed
only
in
old
age
that
intellectual
men
attain
their
sublime
expression
whilst
portraits
of
them
in
their
youth
show
only
the
first
traces
of
it
but
on
the
other
hand
what
i
have
just
said
about
the
shock
which
the
first
sight
of
a
face
generally
produces
is
in
keeping
with
the
remark
that
it
is
only
at
that
first
sight
that
it
makes
its
true
and
full
impression
for
to
get
a
purely
objective
and
uncorrupted
impression
of
it
we
must
stand
in
no
kind
of
relation
to
the
person
if
possible
we
must
not
yet
have
spoken
with
him
for
every
conversation
places
us
to
some
extent
upon
a
friendly
footing
establishes
a
certain
a
mutual
subjective
relation
which
is
at
once
unfavorable
to
an
objective
point
of
view
and
as
endeavor
is
to
win
esteem
or
friendship
for
himself
the
man
who
is
under
observation
will
at
once
employ
all
those
arts
of
dissimulation
in
which
he
is
already
versed
and
corrupt
us
with
his
airs
hypocrisies
and
flatteries
so
that
what
the
first
look
clearly
showed
will
soon
be
seen
by
us
no
more
this
fact
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
saying
that
most
people
gain
by
further
acquaintance
it
ought
however
to
run
delude
us
by
it
it
is
only
when
later
on
the
bad
qualities
manifest
themselves
that
our
first
judgment
as
a
rule
receives
its
justification
and
makes
good
its
scornful
verdict
it
may
be
that
a
further
acquaintance
is
an
unfriendly
one
and
if
that
is
so
we
do
not
find
in
this
case
either
that
people
gain
by
it
another
reason
why
people
apparently
gain
on
a
nearer
acquaintance
is
that
the
man
whose
first
aspect
warns
us
from
him
as
soon
as
we
converse
with
him
no
longer
shows
his
own
being
and
character
but
also
his
education
that
is
not
only
what
he
really
is
by
nature
but
also
what
he
has
appropriated
to
himself
out
of
the
common
wealth
of
mankind
of
what
he
says
belongs
not
to
him
but
to
the
sources
from
which
he
obtained
it
so
that
we
are
often
surprised
to
hear
a
minotaur
speak
so
humanly
if
we
make
a
still
closer
acquaintance
the
animal
nature
of
which
his
face
gave
promise
will
manifest
itself
in
all
its
splendor
if
one
is
gifted
with
an
acute
sense
for
physiognomy
one
should
take
special
note
of
those
verdicts
which
preceded
a
closer
acquaintance
and
were
therefore
genuine
for
the
face
of
a
man
is
the
exact
impression
of
what
he
is
and
if
he
deceives
us
that
is
our
fault
not
his
what
a
man
says
on
the
other
hand
is
what
he
thinks
more
often
what
he
has
learned
or
it
may
be
even
what
he
pretends
to
think
and
besides
this
when
we
talk
to
him
or
even
hear
him
talking
to
others
we
pay
no
attention
to
his
physiognomy
proper
it
is
the
underlying
substance
the
fundamental
and
we
disregard
it
what
interests
us
is
its
pathognomy
its
play
of
feature
during
conversation
this
however
is
so
arranged
as
to
turn
the
good
side
upwards
when
socrates
said
to
a
young
man
who
was
introduced
to
him
to
have
his
capabilities
tested
talk
in
order
that
i
may
see
you
if
indeed
by
seeing
he
did
not
simply
mean
hearing
he
was
right
so
far
as
it
is
only
in
conversation
that
the
features
and
especially
the
eyes
become
animated
and
the
intellectual
resources
and
capacities
set
their
mark
upon
the
countenance
this
puts
us
in
a
position
to
form
a
provisional
notion
of
the
degree
and
capacity
of
intelligence
which
was
in
that
case
socrates
aim
but
in
this
connection
it
is
to
be
observed
firstly
that
the
rule
does
not
apply
to
moral
qualities
which
lie
deeper
and
in
the
second
place
that
what
from
an
objective
point
of
view
we
gain
by
the
clearer
development
of
the
countenance
in
conversation
we
lose
from
a
subjective
standpoint
on
account
of
the
personal
relation
into
which
the
speaker
at
once
enters
in
regard
to
us
and
which
produces
a
slight
fascination
so
that
as
explained
above
we
are
not
left
impartial
observers
consequently
from
the
last
point
of
view
we
might
say
with
greater
accuracy
do
not
speak
in
order
that
i
may
see
you
for
to
get
a
pure
and
fundamental
conception
of
a
man
physiognomy
we
must
observe
him
when
he
is
alone
and
left
to
himself
society
of
any
kind
and
conversation
throw
a
reflection
upon
him
which
is
not
his
own
generally
to
his
advantage
as
he
is
thereby
placed
in
a
state
of
action
and
reaction
which
sets
him
off
but
alone
and
left
to
himself
plunged
in
the
depths
of
his
own
thoughts
and
sensations
he
is
wholly
himself
and
a
penetrating
eye
for
physiognomy
can
at
one
glance
take
a
general
view
of
his
entire
character
for
his
face
looked
at
by
and
in
itself
expresses
the
keynote
of
all
his
thoughts
and
endeavors
the
the
irrevocable
decree
of
his
destiny
the
consciousness
of
which
only
comes
to
him
when
he
is
alone
the
study
of
physiognomy
is
one
of
the
chief
means
of
a
knowledge
of
mankind
because
the
cast
of
a
man
face
is
the
only
sphere
in
which
his
arts
of
dissimulation
are
of
no
avail
since
these
arts
extended
only
to
that
play
of
feature
which
is
akin
to
mimicry
and
that
is
why
i
recommend
such
a
study
to
be
undertaken
when
the
subject
of
it
is
alone
and
given
up
to
his
own
thoughts
and
before
he
is
spoken
to
and
this
partly
for
the
reason
that
it
is
only
in
such
a
condition
that
inspection
of
the
physiognomy
pure
and
simple
is
possible
because
conversation
at
once
lets
in
a
pathognomical
element
in
which
a
man
can
apply
the
arts
of
dissimulation
which
he
has
learned
partly
again
because
personal
contact
even
of
the
very
slightest
kind
gives
a
certain
bias
and
so
corrupts
the
judgment
of
the
observer
and
in
regard
to
the
study
of
physiognomy
in
general
it
is
further
to
be
observed
that
intellectual
capacity
is
much
easier
of
discernment
than
moral
character
the
former
naturally
takes
a
much
more
outward
direction
and
expresses
itself
not
only
in
the
face
and
the
play
of
feature
but
also
in
the
gait
down
even
to
the
very
slightest
movement
one
could
perhaps
discriminate
from
behind
between
a
blockhead
a
fool
and
a
man
of
genius
the
blockhead
would
be
discerned
by
the
torpidity
and
sluggishness
of
all
his
movements
folly
sets
its
mark
upon
every
gesture
and
so
does
intellect
and
a
studious
nature
hence
that
remark
of
la
bruyère
that
there
is
nothing
so
slight
so
simple
or
imperceptible
but
that
our
way
of
doing
it
enters
in
and
betrays
us
a
fool
neither
comes
nor
goes
nor
sits
down
nor
gets
up
nor
holds
his
tongue
nor
moves
about
in
the
same
way
as
an
intelligent
man
and
this
is
be
it
observed
by
way
of
parenthesis
the
explanation
of
that
sure
and
certain
instinct
which
according
to
helvetius
ordinary
folk
possess
of
discerning
people
of
genius
and
of
getting
out
of
their
way
the
chief
reason
for
this
is
that
the
larger
and
more
developed
the
brain
and
the
thinner
in
relation
to
it
the
spine
and
nerves
the
greater
is
the
intellect
and
not
the
intellect
alone
but
at
the
same
time
the
mobility
and
pliancy
of
all
the
limbs
because
the
brain
controls
them
more
immediately
and
resolutely
so
that
everything
hangs
more
upon
a
single
thread
every
movement
of
which
gives
a
precise
expression
to
its
purpose
this
is
analogous
to
nay
is
immediately
connected
with
the
fact
that
the
higher
an
animal
stands
in
the
scale
of
development
the
easier
it
becomes
to
kill
it
by
wounding
a
single
spot
take
for
example
batrachia
they
are
slow
cumbrous
and
sluggish
in
their
movements
they
are
unintelligent
and
at
the
same
time
extremely
tenacious
of
life
the
reason
of
which
is
that
with
a
very
small
brain
their
spine
and
nerves
are
very
thick
now
gait
and
movement
of
the
arms
are
mainly
functions
of
the
brain
our
limbs
receive
their
motion
and
every
little
modification
of
it
from
the
brain
through
the
medium
of
the
spine
this
is
why
conscious
movements
fatigue
us
the
sensation
of
fatigue
like
that
of
pain
has
its
seat
in
the
brain
not
as
people
commonly
suppose
in
the
limbs
themselves
hence
motion
induces
sleep
on
the
other
hand
those
motions
which
are
not
excited
by
the
brain
that
is
the
unconscious
movements
of
organic
life
of
the
heart
of
the
lungs
go
on
in
their
course
without
producing
fatigue
and
as
thought
equally
with
motion
is
a
function
of
the
brain
the
character
of
the
brain
activity
is
expressed
equally
in
both
according
to
the
constitution
of
the
individual
stupid
people
move
like
while
every
joint
of
an
intelligent
man
is
eloquent
but
gesture
and
movement
are
not
nearly
so
good
an
index
of
intellectual
qualities
as
the
face
the
shape
and
size
of
the
brain
the
contraction
and
movement
of
the
features
and
above
all
the
eye
from
the
small
dull
eye
of
a
pig
up
through
all
gradations
to
the
irradiating
flashing
eyes
of
a
genius
the
look
of
good
sense
and
prudence
even
of
the
best
kind
differs
from
that
of
genius
in
that
the
former
bears
the
stamp
of
subjection
to
the
will
while
the
latter
is
free
from
it
and
therefore
one
can
well
believe
the
anecdote
told
by
squarzafichi
in
his
life
of
petrarch
and
taken
from
joseph
brivius
a
contemporary
of
the
poet
how
once
at
the
court
of
the
visconti
when
petrarch
and
other
noblemen
and
gentlemen
were
present
galeazzo
visconti
told
his
son
who
was
then
a
mere
boy
he
was
afterwards
first
duke
of
milan
to
pick
out
the
wisest
of
the
company
how
the
boy
looked
at
them
all
for
a
little
and
then
took
petrarch
by
the
hand
and
led
him
up
to
his
father
to
the
great
admiration
of
all
present
for
so
clearly
does
nature
set
the
mark
of
her
dignity
on
the
privileged
among
mankind
that
even
a
child
can
discern
it
therefore
i
should
advise
my
sagacious
countrymen
if
ever
again
they
wish
to
trumpet
about
for
thirty
years
a
very
commonplace
person
as
a
great
genius
not
to
choose
for
the
purpose
such
a
physiognomy
as
was
possessed
by
that
philosopher
upon
whose
face
nature
had
written
in
her
clearest
characters
the
familiar
inscription
commonplace
person
but
what
applies
to
intellectual
capacity
will
not
apply
to
moral
qualities
to
character
it
is
more
difficult
to
discern
its
physiognomy
because
being
of
a
metaphysical
nature
it
lies
incomparably
deeper
it
is
true
that
moral
character
is
also
connected
with
the
constitution
with
the
organism
but
not
so
immediately
or
in
such
direct
connection
with
definite
parts
of
its
system
as
is
intellectual
capacity
hence
while
everyone
makes
a
show
of
his
intelligence
and
endeavors
to
exhibit
it
at
every
opportunity
as
something
with
which
he
is
in
general
quite
contented
few
expose
their
moral
qualities
freely
and
most
people
intentionally
cover
them
up
and
long
practice
makes
the
concealment
perfect
in
the
meantime
as
i
explained
above
wicked
thoughts
and
worthless
efforts
gradually
set
their
mask
upon
the
face
especially
the
eyes
so
that
judging
by
physiognomy
it
is
easy
to
warrant
that
a
given
man
will
never
produce
an
immortal
work
but
not
that
he
will
never
commit
a
great
crime
psychological
observations
for
every
animal
and
more
especially
for
man
a
certain
conformity
and
proportion
between
the
will
and
the
intellect
is
necessary
for
existing
or
making
any
progress
in
the
world
the
more
precise
and
correct
the
proportion
which
nature
establishes
the
more
easy
safe
and
agreeable
will
be
the
passage
through
the
world
still
if
the
right
point
is
only
approximately
reached
it
will
be
enough
to
ward
off
destruction
there
are
then
certain
limits
within
which
the
said
proportion
may
vary
and
yet
preserve
a
correct
standard
of
conformity
the
normal
standard
is
as
follows
the
object
of
the
intellect
is
to
light
and
lead
the
will
on
its
path
and
therefore
the
greater
the
force
impetus
and
passion
which
spurs
on
the
will
from
within
the
more
complete
and
luminous
must
be
the
intellect
which
is
attached
to
it
that
the
vehement
strife
of
the
will
the
glow
of
passion
and
the
intensity
of
the
emotions
may
not
lead
man
astray
or
urge
him
on
to
ill
considered
false
or
ruinous
action
this
will
inevitably
be
the
result
if
the
will
is
very
violent
and
the
intellect
very
weak
on
the
other
hand
a
phlegmatic
character
a
weak
and
languid
will
can
get
on
and
hold
its
own
with
a
small
amount
of
intellect
what
is
naturally
moderate
needs
only
moderate
support
the
general
tendency
of
a
want
of
proportion
between
the
will
and
the
intellect
in
other
words
of
any
variation
from
the
normal
proportion
i
have
mentioned
is
to
produce
unhappiness
whether
it
be
that
the
will
is
greater
than
the
intellect
or
the
intellect
greater
than
the
will
especially
is
this
the
case
when
the
intellect
is
developed
to
an
abnormal
degree
of
strength
and
superiority
so
as
to
be
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
will
a
condition
which
is
the
essence
of
real
genius
the
intellect
is
then
not
only
more
than
enough
for
the
needs
and
aims
of
life
it
is
absolutely
prejudicial
to
them
the
result
is
that
in
youth
excessive
energy
in
grasping
the
objective
world
accompanied
by
a
vivid
imagination
and
a
total
lack
of
experience
makes
the
mind
susceptible
and
an
easy
prey
to
extravagant
ideas
nay
even
to
chimeras
and
the
result
is
an
eccentric
and
phantastic
character
and
when
in
later
years
this
state
of
mind
yields
and
passes
away
under
the
teaching
of
experience
still
the
genius
never
feels
himself
at
home
in
the
common
world
of
every
day
and
the
ordinary
business
of
life
he
will
never
take
his
place
in
it
and
accommodate
himself
to
it
as
accurately
as
the
person
of
moral
intellect
he
will
be
much
more
likely
to
make
curious
mistakes
for
the
ordinary
mind
feels
itself
so
completely
at
home
in
the
narrow
circle
of
its
ideas
and
views
of
the
world
that
no
one
can
get
the
better
of
it
in
that
sphere
its
faculties
remain
true
to
their
original
purpose
to
promote
the
service
of
the
will
it
devotes
itself
steadfastly
to
this
end
and
abjures
extravagant
aims
the
genius
on
the
other
hand
is
at
bottom
a
per
just
as
conversely
the
passionate
violent
and
unintelligent
man
the
brainless
barbarian
is
a
per
will
to
which
forms
the
inmost
core
of
every
living
being
exhibits
itself
most
conspicuously
in
the
higher
order
of
animals
that
is
the
cleverer
ones
and
so
in
them
the
nature
of
the
will
may
be
seen
and
examined
most
clearly
for
in
the
lower
orders
its
activity
is
not
so
evident
it
has
a
lower
degree
of
objectivation
whereas
in
the
class
which
stands
above
the
higher
order
of
animals
that
is
in
men
reason
enters
in
and
with
reason
comes
discretion
and
with
discretion
the
capacity
of
dissimulation
which
throws
a
veil
over
the
operations
of
the
will
and
in
mankind
consequently
the
will
appears
without
its
mask
only
in
the
affections
and
the
passions
and
this
is
the
reason
why
passion
when
it
speaks
always
wins
credence
no
matter
what
the
passion
may
be
and
rightly
so
for
the
same
reason
the
passions
are
the
main
theme
of
poets
and
the
stalking
horse
of
actors
the
conspicuousness
of
the
will
in
the
lower
order
of
animals
explains
the
delight
we
take
in
dogs
apes
cats
etc
it
is
the
entirely
naive
way
in
which
they
express
themselves
that
gives
us
so
much
pleasure
the
sight
of
any
free
animal
going
about
its
business
undisturbed
seeking
its
food
or
looking
after
its
young
or
mixing
in
the
company
of
its
kind
all
the
time
being
exactly
what
it
ought
to
be
and
can
be
what
a
strange
pleasure
it
gives
us
even
if
it
is
only
a
bird
i
can
watch
it
for
a
long
time
with
delight
or
a
water
rat
or
a
hedgehog
or
better
still
a
weasel
a
deer
or
a
stag
the
main
reason
why
we
take
so
much
pleasure
in
looking
at
animals
is
that
we
like
to
see
our
own
nature
in
such
a
simplified
form
there
is
only
one
mendacious
being
in
the
world
and
that
is
man
every
other
is
true
and
sincere
and
makes
no
attempt
to
conceal
what
it
is
expressing
its
feelings
just
as
they
are
many
things
are
put
down
to
the
force
of
habit
which
are
rather
to
be
attributed
to
the
constancy
and
immutability
of
original
innate
character
according
to
which
under
like
circumstances
we
always
do
the
same
thing
whether
it
happens
for
the
first
or
the
hundredth
time
it
is
in
virtue
of
the
same
necessity
real
force
of
habit
as
a
matter
of
fact
rests
upon
that
indolent
passive
disposition
which
seeks
to
relieve
the
intellect
and
the
will
of
a
fresh
choice
and
so
makes
us
do
what
we
did
yesterday
and
have
done
a
hundred
times
before
and
of
which
we
know
that
it
will
attain
its
object
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
lies
deeper
and
a
more
precise
explanation
of
it
can
be
given
than
appears
at
first
sight
bodies
which
may
be
moved
by
mechanical
means
only
are
subject
to
the
power
of
inertia
and
applied
to
bodies
which
may
be
acted
on
by
motives
this
power
becomes
the
force
of
habit
the
actions
which
we
perform
by
mere
habit
come
about
in
fact
without
any
individual
separate
motive
brought
into
play
for
the
particular
case
hence
in
performing
them
we
really
do
not
think
about
them
a
motive
was
present
only
on
the
first
few
occasions
on
which
the
action
happened
which
has
since
become
a
habit
the
secondary
of
this
motive
is
the
present
habit
and
it
is
sufficient
to
enable
the
action
to
continue
just
as
when
a
body
had
been
set
in
motion
by
a
push
it
requires
no
more
pushing
in
order
to
continue
its
motion
it
will
go
on
to
all
eternity
if
it
meets
with
no
friction
it
is
the
same
in
the
case
of
animals
training
is
a
habit
which
is
forced
upon
them
the
horse
goes
on
drawing
his
cart
quite
contentedly
without
having
to
be
urged
on
the
motion
is
the
continued
effect
of
those
strokes
of
the
whip
which
urged
him
on
at
first
by
the
law
of
inertia
they
have
become
perpetuated
as
habit
all
this
is
really
more
than
a
mere
parable
it
is
the
underlying
identity
of
the
will
at
very
different
degrees
of
its
objectivation
in
virtue
of
which
the
same
law
of
motion
takes
such
different
forms
muchos
is
the
ordinary
greeting
in
spain
and
all
over
the
earth
it
is
quite
customary
to
wish
people
a
long
life
it
is
presumably
not
a
knowledge
of
life
which
directs
such
a
wish
it
is
rather
knowledge
of
what
man
is
in
his
inmost
nature
will
to
the
wish
which
everyone
has
that
he
may
be
remembered
after
his
death
a
wish
which
rises
to
the
longing
for
posthumous
glory
in
the
case
of
those
whose
aims
are
high
seems
to
me
to
spring
from
this
clinging
to
life
when
the
time
comes
which
cuts
a
man
off
from
every
possibility
of
real
existence
he
strives
after
a
life
which
is
still
attainable
even
though
it
be
a
shadowy
and
ideal
one
the
deep
grief
we
feel
at
the
loss
of
a
friend
arises
from
the
feeling
that
in
every
individual
there
is
something
which
no
words
can
express
something
which
is
peculiarly
his
own
and
therefore
irreparable
individuum
we
may
come
to
look
upon
the
death
of
our
enemies
and
adversaries
even
long
after
it
has
occurred
with
just
as
much
regret
as
we
feel
for
that
of
our
friends
when
we
miss
them
as
witnesses
of
our
brilliant
success
that
the
sudden
announcement
of
a
very
happy
event
may
easily
prove
fatal
rests
upon
the
fact
that
happiness
and
misery
depend
merely
on
the
proportion
which
our
claims
bear
to
what
we
get
accordingly
the
good
things
we
possess
or
are
certain
of
getting
are
not
felt
to
be
such
because
all
pleasure
is
in
fact
of
a
negative
nature
and
effects
the
relief
of
pain
while
pain
or
evil
is
what
is
really
positive
it
is
the
object
of
immediate
sensation
with
the
possession
or
certain
expectation
of
good
things
our
demands
rises
and
increases
our
capacity
for
further
possession
and
larger
expectations
but
if
we
are
depressed
by
continual
misfortune
and
our
claims
reduced
to
a
minimum
the
sudden
advent
of
happiness
finds
no
capacity
for
enjoying
it
neutralized
by
an
absence
of
claims
its
effects
are
apparently
positive
and
so
its
whole
force
is
brought
into
play
hence
it
may
possibly
break
our
feelings
be
fatal
to
them
and
so
as
is
well
known
one
must
be
careful
in
announcing
great
happiness
first
one
must
get
the
person
to
hope
for
it
then
open
up
the
prospect
of
it
then
communicate
part
of
it
and
at
last
make
it
fully
known
every
portion
of
the
good
news
loses
its
efficacy
because
it
is
anticipated
by
a
demand
and
room
is
left
for
an
increase
in
it
in
view
of
all
this
it
may
be
said
that
our
stomach
for
good
fortune
is
bottomless
but
the
entrance
to
it
is
narrow
these
remarks
are
not
applicable
to
great
misfortunes
in
the
same
way
they
are
more
seldom
fatal
because
hope
always
sets
itself
against
them
that
an
analogous
part
is
not
played
by
fear
in
the
case
of
happiness
results
from
the
fact
that
we
are
instinctively
more
inclined
to
hope
than
to
fear
just
as
our
eyes
turn
of
themselves
towards
light
rather
than
darkness
hope
is
the
result
of
confusing
the
desire
that
something
should
take
place
with
the
probability
that
it
will
perhaps
no
man
is
free
from
this
folly
of
the
heart
which
deranges
the
intellect
correct
appreciation
of
probability
to
such
an
extent
that
if
the
chances
are
a
thousand
to
one
against
it
yet
the
event
is
thought
a
likely
one
still
in
spite
of
this
a
sudden
misfortune
is
like
a
death
stroke
whilst
a
hope
that
is
always
disappointed
and
still
never
dies
is
like
death
by
prolonged
torture
he
who
has
lost
all
hope
has
also
lost
all
fear
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
expression
desperate
it
is
natural
to
a
man
to
believe
what
he
wishes
to
be
true
and
to
believe
it
because
he
wishes
it
if
this
characteristic
of
our
nature
at
once
beneficial
and
assuaging
is
rooted
out
by
many
hard
blows
of
fate
and
a
man
comes
conversely
to
a
condition
in
which
he
believes
a
thing
must
happen
because
he
does
not
wish
it
and
what
he
wishes
to
happen
can
never
be
just
because
he
wishes
it
this
is
in
reality
the
state
described
as
desperation
that
we
are
so
often
deceived
in
others
is
not
because
our
judgment
is
at
fault
but
because
in
general
as
bacon
says
luminis
sicci
non
est
sed
recipit
infusionem
a
voluntate
et
that
is
to
say
trifles
unconsciously
bias
us
for
or
against
a
person
from
the
very
beginning
it
may
also
be
explained
by
our
not
abiding
by
the
qualities
which
we
really
discover
we
go
on
to
conclude
the
presence
of
others
which
we
think
inseparable
from
them
or
the
absence
of
those
which
we
consider
incompatible
for
instance
when
we
perceive
generosity
we
infer
justice
from
piety
we
infer
honesty
from
lying
deception
from
deception
stealing
etc
a
procedure
which
opens
the
door
to
many
false
views
partly
because
human
nature
is
so
strange
partly
because
our
standpoint
is
so
it
is
true
indeed
that
character
always
forms
a
consistent
and
connected
whole
but
the
roots
of
all
its
qualities
lie
too
deep
to
allow
of
our
concluding
from
particular
data
in
a
given
case
whether
certain
qualities
can
or
can
not
exist
together
we
often
happen
to
say
things
that
may
in
some
way
or
other
be
prejudicial
to
us
but
we
keep
silent
about
things
that
might
make
us
look
ridiculous
because
in
this
case
effect
follows
very
quickly
on
cause
the
pain
of
an
unfulfilled
wish
is
small
in
comparison
with
that
of
repentance
for
the
one
stands
in
the
presence
of
the
vast
open
future
whilst
the
other
has
the
irrevocable
past
closed
behind
it
patience
especially
the
spanish
is
strongly
connected
with
the
notion
of
it
is
therefore
a
passive
state
just
as
the
opposite
is
an
active
state
of
the
mind
with
which
when
great
patience
is
incompatible
it
is
the
innate
virtue
of
a
phlegmatic
indolent
and
spiritless
people
as
also
of
women
but
that
it
is
nevertheless
so
very
useful
and
necessary
is
a
sign
that
the
world
is
very
badly
constituted
money
is
human
happiness
in
the
abstract
he
then
who
is
no
longer
capable
of
enjoying
human
happiness
in
the
concrete
devotes
his
heart
entirely
to
money
obstinacy
is
the
result
of
the
will
forcing
itself
into
the
place
of
the
intellect
if
you
want
to
find
out
your
real
opinion
of
anyone
observe
the
impression
made
upon
you
by
the
first
sight
of
a
letter
from
him
the
course
of
our
individual
life
and
the
events
in
it
as
far
as
their
true
meaning
and
connection
is
concerned
may
be
compared
to
a
piece
of
rough
mosaic
so
long
as
you
stand
close
in
front
of
it
you
can
not
get
a
right
view
of
the
objects
presented
nor
perceive
their
significance
or
beauty
both
come
in
sight
only
when
you
stand
a
little
way
off
and
in
the
same
way
you
often
understand
the
true
connection
of
important
events
in
your
life
not
while
they
are
going
on
nor
soon
after
they
are
past
but
only
a
considerable
time
afterwards
is
this
so
because
we
require
the
magnifying
effect
of
imagination
or
because
we
can
get
a
general
view
only
from
a
distance
or
because
the
school
of
experience
makes
our
judgment
ripe
perhaps
all
of
these
together
but
it
is
certain
that
we
often
view
in
the
right
light
the
actions
of
others
and
occasionally
even
our
own
only
after
the
lapse
of
years
and
as
it
is
in
one
own
life
so
it
is
in
history
happy
circumstances
in
life
are
like
certain
groups
of
trees
seen
from
a
distance
they
look
very
well
but
go
up
to
them
and
amongst
them
and
the
beauty
vanishes
you
do
know
where
it
can
be
it
is
only
trees
you
see
and
so
it
is
that
we
often
envy
the
lot
of
others
the
doctor
sees
all
the
weakness
of
mankind
the
lawyer
all
the
wickedness
the
theologian
all
the
stupidity
a
person
of
phlegmatic
disposition
who
is
a
blockhead
would
with
a
sanguine
nature
be
a
fool
now
and
then
one
learns
something
but
one
forgets
the
whole
day
long
moreover
our
memory
is
like
a
sieve
the
holes
of
which
in
time
get
larger
and
larger
the
older
we
get
the
quicker
anything
entrusted
to
it
slips
from
the
memory
whereas
what
was
fixed
fast
in
it
in
early
days
is
there
still
the
memory
of
an
old
man
gets
clearer
and
clearer
the
further
it
goes
back
and
less
clear
the
nearer
it
approaches
the
present
time
so
that
his
memory
like
his
eyes
becomes
in
the
process
of
learning
you
may
be
apprehensive
about
bewildering
and
confusing
the
memory
but
not
about
overloading
it
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
the
faculty
for
remembering
is
not
diminished
in
proportion
to
what
one
has
learnt
just
as
little
as
the
number
of
moulds
in
which
you
cast
sand
lessens
its
capacity
for
being
cast
in
new
moulds
in
this
sense
the
memory
is
bottomless
and
yet
the
greater
and
more
various
any
one
knowledge
the
longer
he
takes
to
find
out
anything
that
may
suddenly
be
asked
him
because
he
is
like
a
shopkeeper
who
has
to
get
the
article
wanted
from
a
large
and
multifarious
store
or
more
strictly
speaking
because
out
of
many
possible
trains
of
thought
he
has
to
recall
exactly
that
one
which
as
a
result
of
previous
training
leads
to
the
matter
in
question
for
the
memory
is
not
a
repository
of
things
you
wish
to
preserve
but
a
mere
dexterity
of
the
intellectual
powers
hence
the
mind
always
contains
its
sum
of
knowledge
only
potentially
never
actually
it
sometimes
happens
that
my
memory
will
not
reproduce
some
word
in
a
foreign
language
or
a
name
or
some
artistic
expression
although
i
know
it
very
well
after
i
have
bothered
myself
in
vain
about
it
for
a
longer
or
a
shorter
time
i
give
up
thinking
about
it
altogether
an
hour
or
two
afterwards
in
rare
cases
even
later
still
sometimes
only
after
four
or
five
weeks
the
word
i
was
trying
to
recall
occurs
to
me
while
i
am
thinking
of
something
else
as
suddenly
as
if
some
one
had
whispered
it
to
me
after
noticing
this
phenomenon
with
wonder
for
very
many
years
i
have
come
to
think
that
the
probable
explanation
of
it
is
as
follows
after
the
troublesome
and
unsuccessful
search
my
will
retains
its
craving
to
know
the
word
and
so
sets
a
watch
for
it
in
the
intellect
later
on
in
the
course
and
play
of
thought
some
word
by
chance
occurs
having
the
same
initial
letters
or
some
other
resemblance
to
the
word
which
is
sought
then
the
sentinel
springs
forward
and
supplies
what
is
wanting
to
make
up
the
word
seizes
it
and
suddenly
brings
it
up
in
triumph
without
my
knowing
where
and
how
he
got
it
so
it
seems
as
if
some
one
had
whispered
it
to
me
it
is
the
same
process
as
that
adopted
by
a
teacher
towards
a
child
who
can
not
repeat
a
word
the
teacher
just
suggests
the
first
letter
of
the
word
or
even
the
second
too
then
the
child
remembers
it
in
default
of
this
process
you
can
end
by
going
methodically
through
all
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
in
the
ordinary
man
injustice
rouses
a
passionate
desire
for
vengeance
and
it
has
often
been
said
that
vengeance
is
sweet
how
many
sacrifices
have
been
made
just
to
enjoy
the
feeling
of
vengeance
without
any
intention
of
causing
an
amount
of
injury
equivalent
to
what
one
has
suffered
the
bitter
death
of
the
centaur
nessus
was
sweetened
by
the
certainty
that
he
had
used
his
last
moments
to
work
out
an
extremely
clever
vengeance
walter
scott
expresses
the
same
human
inclination
in
language
as
true
as
it
is
strong
vengeance
is
the
sweetest
morsel
to
the
mouth
that
ever
was
cooked
in
hell
i
shall
now
attempt
a
psychological
explanation
of
it
suffering
which
falls
to
our
lot
in
the
course
of
nature
or
by
chance
or
fate
does
not
seem
so
painful
as
suffering
which
is
inflicted
on
us
by
the
arbitrary
will
of
another
this
is
because
we
look
upon
nature
and
chance
as
the
fundamental
masters
of
the
world
we
see
that
the
blow
we
received
from
them
might
just
as
well
have
fallen
on
another
in
the
case
of
suffering
which
springs
from
this
source
we
bewail
the
common
lot
of
humanity
rather
than
our
own
misfortune
but
that
it
is
the
arbitrary
will
of
another
which
inflicts
the
suffering
is
a
peculiarly
bitter
addition
to
the
pain
or
injury
it
causes
the
consciousness
that
some
one
else
is
superior
to
us
whether
by
force
or
cunning
while
we
lie
helpless
if
amends
are
possible
amends
heal
the
injury
but
that
bitter
addition
and
it
was
you
who
did
that
to
me
which
is
often
more
painful
than
the
injury
itself
is
only
to
be
neutralized
by
vengeance
by
inflicting
injury
on
the
one
who
has
injured
us
whether
we
do
it
by
force
or
cunning
is
to
show
our
superiority
to
him
and
to
annul
the
proof
of
his
superiority
to
us
that
gives
our
hearts
the
satisfaction
towards
which
it
yearns
so
where
there
is
a
great
deal
of
pride
and
vanity
there
also
will
there
be
a
great
desire
of
vengeance
but
as
the
fulfillment
of
every
wish
brings
with
it
more
or
less
of
a
sense
of
disappointment
so
it
is
with
vengeance
the
delight
we
hope
to
get
from
it
is
mostly
embittered
by
compassion
vengeance
taken
will
often
tear
the
heart
and
torment
the
conscience
the
motive
to
it
is
no
longer
active
and
what
remains
is
the
evidence
of
our
malice
the
christian
system
when
the
church
says
that
in
the
dogmas
of
religion
reason
is
totally
incompetent
and
blind
and
its
use
to
be
reprehended
it
is
in
reality
attesting
the
fact
that
these
dogmas
are
allegorical
in
their
nature
and
are
not
to
be
judged
by
the
standard
which
reason
taking
all
things
can
alone
apply
now
the
absurdities
of
a
dogma
are
just
the
mark
and
sign
of
what
is
allegorical
and
mythical
in
it
in
the
case
under
consideration
however
the
absurdities
spring
from
the
fact
that
two
such
heterogeneous
doctrines
as
those
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
had
to
be
combined
the
great
allegory
was
of
gradual
growth
suggested
by
external
and
adventitious
circumstances
it
was
developed
by
the
interpretation
put
upon
them
an
interpretation
in
quiet
touch
with
certain
truths
only
half
realized
the
allegory
was
finally
completed
by
augustine
who
penetrated
deepest
into
its
meaning
and
so
was
able
to
conceive
it
as
a
systematic
whole
and
supply
its
defects
hence
the
augustinian
doctrine
confirmed
by
luther
is
the
complete
form
of
christianity
and
the
protestants
of
who
take
revelation
and
confine
it
to
a
single
individual
are
in
error
in
looking
upon
the
first
beginnings
of
christianity
as
its
most
perfect
expression
but
the
bad
thing
about
all
religions
is
that
instead
of
being
able
to
confess
their
allegorical
nature
they
have
to
conceal
it
accordingly
they
parade
their
doctrine
in
all
seriousness
as
true
and
as
absurdities
form
an
essential
part
of
these
doctrines
you
have
the
great
mischief
of
a
continual
fraud
and
what
is
worse
the
day
arrives
when
they
are
no
longer
true
and
then
there
is
an
end
of
them
so
that
in
that
respect
it
would
be
better
to
admit
their
allegorical
nature
at
once
but
the
difficulty
is
to
teach
the
multitude
that
something
can
be
both
true
and
untrue
at
the
same
time
and
as
all
religions
are
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
this
nature
we
must
recognize
the
fact
that
mankind
can
not
get
on
without
a
certain
amount
of
absurdity
that
absurdity
is
an
element
in
its
existence
and
illusion
indispensable
as
indeed
other
aspects
of
life
testify
i
have
said
that
the
combination
of
the
old
testament
with
the
new
gives
rise
to
absurdities
among
the
examples
which
illustrate
what
i
mean
i
may
cite
the
christian
doctrine
of
predestination
and
grace
as
formulated
by
augustine
and
adopted
from
him
by
luther
according
to
which
one
man
is
endowed
with
grace
and
another
is
not
grace
then
comes
to
be
a
privilege
received
at
birth
and
brought
ready
into
the
world
a
privilege
too
in
a
matter
second
to
none
in
importance
what
is
obnoxious
and
absurd
in
this
doctrine
may
be
traced
to
the
idea
contained
in
the
old
testament
that
man
is
the
creation
of
an
external
will
which
called
him
into
existence
out
of
nothing
it
is
quite
true
that
genuine
moral
excellence
is
really
innate
but
the
meaning
of
the
christian
doctrine
is
expressed
in
another
and
more
rational
way
by
the
theory
of
metempsychosis
common
to
brahmans
and
buddhists
according
to
this
theory
the
qualities
which
distinguish
one
man
from
another
are
received
at
birth
are
brought
that
is
to
say
from
another
world
and
a
former
life
these
qualities
are
not
an
external
gift
of
grace
but
are
the
fruits
of
the
acts
committed
in
that
other
world
but
augustine
dogma
of
predestination
is
connected
with
another
dogma
namely
that
the
mass
of
humanity
is
corrupt
and
doomed
to
eternal
damnation
that
very
few
will
be
found
righteous
and
attain
salvation
and
that
only
in
consequence
of
the
gift
of
grace
and
because
they
are
predestined
to
be
saved
whilst
the
remainder
will
be
overwhelmed
by
the
perdition
they
have
deserved
eternal
torment
in
hell
taken
in
its
ordinary
meaning
the
dogma
is
revolting
for
it
comes
to
this
it
condemns
a
man
who
may
be
perhaps
scarcely
twenty
years
of
age
to
expiate
his
errors
or
even
his
unbelief
in
everlasting
torment
nay
more
it
makes
this
almost
universal
damnation
the
natural
effect
of
original
sin
and
therefore
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
fall
this
is
a
result
which
must
have
been
foreseen
by
him
who
made
mankind
and
who
in
the
first
place
made
them
not
better
than
they
are
and
secondly
set
a
trap
for
them
into
which
he
must
have
known
they
would
fall
for
he
made
the
whole
world
and
nothing
is
hidden
from
him
according
to
this
doctrine
then
god
created
out
of
nothing
a
weak
race
prone
to
sin
in
order
to
give
them
over
to
endless
torment
and
as
a
last
characteristic
we
are
told
that
this
god
who
prescribes
forbearance
and
forgiveness
of
every
fault
exercises
none
himself
but
does
the
exact
opposite
for
a
punishment
which
comes
at
the
end
of
all
things
when
the
world
is
over
and
done
with
can
not
have
for
its
object
either
to
improve
or
deter
and
is
therefore
pure
vengeance
so
that
on
this
view
the
whole
race
is
actually
destined
to
eternal
torture
and
damnation
and
created
expressly
for
this
end
the
only
exception
being
those
few
persons
who
are
rescued
by
election
of
grace
from
what
motive
one
does
not
know
putting
these
aside
it
looks
as
if
the
blessed
lord
had
created
the
world
for
the
benefit
of
the
devil
it
would
have
been
so
much
better
not
to
have
made
it
at
all
so
much
then
for
a
dogma
taken
but
look
at
it
and
the
whole
matter
becomes
capable
of
a
satisfactory
interpretation
what
is
absurd
and
revolting
in
this
dogma
is
in
the
main
as
i
said
the
simple
outcome
of
jewish
theism
with
its
creation
out
of
nothing
and
really
foolish
and
paradoxical
denial
of
the
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
which
is
involved
in
that
idea
a
doctrine
which
is
natural
to
a
certain
extent
and
with
the
exception
of
the
jews
accepted
by
nearly
the
whole
human
race
at
all
times
to
remove
the
enormous
evil
arising
from
augustine
dogma
and
to
modify
its
revolting
nature
pope
gregory
in
the
sixth
century
very
prudently
matured
the
doctrine
of
the
essence
of
which
already
existed
in
origen
cf
article
on
origen
note
the
doctrine
was
regularly
incorporated
into
the
faith
of
the
church
so
that
the
original
view
was
much
modified
and
a
certain
substitute
provided
for
the
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
for
both
the
one
and
the
other
admit
a
process
of
purification
to
the
same
end
the
doctrine
of
the
restoration
of
all
things
greek
apokatastasis
was
established
according
to
which
in
the
last
act
of
the
human
comedy
the
sinners
one
and
all
will
be
reinstated
it
is
only
protestants
with
their
obstinate
belief
in
the
bible
who
can
not
be
induced
to
give
up
eternal
punishment
in
hell
if
one
were
spiteful
one
might
say
much
good
may
it
do
them
but
it
is
consoling
to
think
that
they
really
do
not
believe
the
doctrine
they
leave
it
alone
thinking
in
their
hearts
it
ca
be
so
bad
as
all
that
the
rigid
and
systematic
character
of
his
mind
led
augustine
in
his
austere
dogmatism
and
his
resolute
definition
of
doctrines
only
just
indicated
in
the
bible
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
resting
on
very
vague
grounds
to
give
hard
outlines
to
these
doctrines
and
to
put
a
harsh
construction
on
christianity
the
result
of
which
is
that
his
views
offend
us
and
just
as
in
his
day
pelagianism
arose
to
combat
them
so
now
in
our
day
rationalism
does
the
same
take
for
example
the
case
as
he
states
it
generally
in
the
civitate
bk
xii
ch
it
comes
to
this
god
creates
a
being
out
of
nothing
forbids
him
some
things
and
enjoins
others
upon
him
and
because
these
commands
are
not
obeyed
he
tortures
him
to
all
eternity
with
every
conceivable
anguish
and
for
this
purpose
binds
soul
and
body
inseparably
together
so
that
instead
of
the
torment
destroying
this
being
by
splitting
him
up
into
his
elements
and
so
setting
him
free
he
may
live
to
eternal
pain
this
poor
creature
formed
out
of
nothing
at
least
he
has
a
claim
on
his
original
nothing
he
should
be
assured
as
a
matter
of
right
of
this
last
retreat
which
in
any
case
can
not
be
a
very
evil
one
it
is
what
he
has
inherited
i
at
any
rate
can
not
help
sympathizing
with
him
if
you
add
to
this
augustine
remaining
doctrines
that
all
this
does
not
depend
on
the
man
own
sins
and
omissions
but
was
already
predestined
to
happen
one
really
is
at
a
loss
what
to
think
our
highly
educated
rationalists
say
to
be
sure
it
all
false
it
a
mere
bugbear
we
in
a
state
of
constant
progress
step
by
step
raising
ourselves
to
ever
greater
perfection
ah
what
a
pity
we
did
begin
sooner
we
should
already
have
been
there
in
the
christian
system
the
devil
is
a
personage
of
the
greatest
importance
god
is
described
as
absolutely
good
wise
and
powerful
and
unless
he
were
counterbalanced
by
the
devil
it
would
be
impossible
to
see
where
the
innumerable
and
measureless
evils
which
predominate
in
the
world
come
from
if
there
were
no
devil
to
account
for
them
and
since
the
rationalists
have
done
away
with
the
devil
the
damage
inflicted
on
the
other
side
has
gone
on
growing
and
is
becoming
more
and
more
palpable
as
might
have
been
foreseen
and
was
foreseen
by
the
orthodox
the
fact
is
you
can
not
take
away
one
pillar
from
a
building
without
endangering
the
rest
of
it
and
this
confirms
the
view
which
has
been
established
on
other
grounds
that
jehovah
is
a
transformation
of
ormuzd
and
satan
of
the
ahriman
who
must
be
taken
in
connection
with
him
ormuzd
himself
is
a
transformation
of
indra
christianity
has
this
peculiar
disadvantage
that
unlike
other
religions
it
is
not
a
pure
system
of
doctrine
its
chief
and
essential
feature
is
that
it
is
a
history
a
series
of
events
a
collection
of
facts
a
statement
of
the
actions
and
sufferings
of
individuals
it
is
this
history
which
constitutes
dogma
and
belief
in
it
is
salvation
other
religions
buddhism
for
instance
have
it
is
true
historical
appendages
the
life
namely
of
their
founders
this
however
is
not
part
and
parcel
of
the
dogma
but
is
taken
along
with
it
for
example
the
lalitavistara
may
be
compared
with
the
gospel
so
far
as
it
contains
the
life
of
the
buddha
of
the
present
period
of
the
history
but
this
is
something
which
is
quite
separate
and
different
from
the
dogma
from
the
system
itself
and
for
this
reason
the
lives
of
former
buddhas
were
quite
other
and
those
of
the
future
will
be
quite
other
than
the
life
of
the
buddha
of
the
dogma
is
by
no
means
one
with
the
career
of
its
founder
it
does
not
rest
on
individual
persons
or
events
it
is
something
universal
and
equally
valid
at
all
times
the
lalitavistara
is
not
then
a
gospel
in
the
christian
sense
of
the
word
it
is
not
the
joyful
message
of
an
act
of
redemption
it
is
the
career
of
him
who
has
shown
how
each
one
may
redeem
himself
the
historical
constitution
of
christianity
makes
the
chinese
laugh
at
missionaries
as
i
may
mention
here
another
fundamental
error
of
christianity
an
error
which
can
not
be
explained
away
and
the
mischievous
consequences
of
which
are
obvious
every
day
i
mean
the
unnatural
distinction
christianity
makes
between
man
and
the
animal
world
to
which
he
really
belongs
it
sets
up
man
as
and
looks
upon
animals
as
merely
things
brahmanism
and
buddhism
on
the
other
hand
true
to
the
facts
recognize
in
a
positive
way
that
man
is
related
generally
to
the
whole
of
nature
and
specially
and
principally
to
animal
nature
and
in
their
systems
man
is
always
represented
by
the
theory
of
metempsychosis
and
otherwise
as
closely
connected
with
the
animal
world
the
important
part
played
by
animals
all
through
buddhism
and
brahmanism
compared
with
the
total
disregard
of
them
in
judaism
and
christianity
puts
an
end
to
any
question
as
to
which
system
is
nearer
perfection
however
much
we
in
europe
may
have
become
accustomed
to
the
absurdity
of
the
claim
christianity
contains
in
fact
a
great
and
essential
imperfection
in
limiting
its
precepts
to
man
and
in
refusing
rights
to
the
entire
animal
world
as
religion
fails
to
protect
animals
against
the
rough
unfeeling
and
often
more
than
bestial
multitude
the
duty
falls
to
the
police
and
as
the
police
are
unequal
to
the
task
societies
for
the
protection
of
animals
are
now
formed
all
over
europe
and
america
in
the
whole
of
uncircumcised
asia
such
a
procedure
would
be
the
most
superfluous
thing
in
the
world
because
animals
are
there
sufficiently
protected
by
religion
which
even
makes
them
objects
of
charity
how
such
charitable
feelings
bear
fruit
may
be
seen
to
take
an
example
in
the
great
hospital
for
animals
at
surat
whither
christians
mohammedans
and
jews
can
send
their
sick
beasts
which
if
cured
are
very
rightly
not
restored
to
their
owners
in
the
same
way
when
a
brahman
or
a
buddhist
has
a
slice
of
good
luck
a
happy
issue
in
any
affair
instead
of
mumbling
a
he
goes
to
the
and
buys
birds
and
opens
their
cages
at
the
city
gate
a
thing
which
may
be
frequently
seen
in
astrachan
where
the
adherents
of
every
religion
meet
together
and
so
on
in
a
hundred
similar
ways
on
the
other
hand
look
at
the
revolting
ruffianism
with
which
our
christian
public
treats
its
animals
killing
them
for
no
object
at
all
and
laughing
over
it
or
mutilating
or
torturing
them
even
its
horses
who
form
its
most
direct
means
of
livelihood
are
strained
to
the
utmost
in
their
old
age
and
the
last
strength
worked
out
of
their
poor
bones
until
they
succumb
at
last
under
the
whip
one
might
say
with
truth
mankind
are
the
devils
of
the
earth
and
the
animals
the
souls
they
torment
but
what
can
you
expect
from
the
masses
when
there
are
men
of
education
zoologists
even
who
instead
of
admitting
what
is
so
familiar
to
them
the
essential
identity
of
man
and
animal
are
bigoted
and
stupid
enough
to
offer
a
zealous
opposition
to
their
honest
and
rational
colleagues
when
they
class
man
under
the
proper
head
as
an
animal
or
demonstrate
the
resemblance
between
him
and
the
chimpanzee
or
it
is
a
revolting
thing
that
a
writer
who
is
so
pious
and
christian
in
his
sentiments
as
jung
stilling
should
use
a
simile
like
this
in
his
aus
dem
bk
ii
sc
p
suddenly
the
skeleton
shriveled
up
into
an
indescribably
hideous
and
form
just
as
when
you
bring
a
large
spider
into
the
focus
of
a
burning
glass
and
watch
the
purulent
blood
hiss
and
bubble
in
the
heat
this
man
of
god
then
was
guilty
of
such
infamy
or
looked
on
quietly
when
another
was
committing
it
in
either
case
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
here
so
little
harm
did
he
think
of
it
that
he
tells
us
of
it
in
passing
and
without
a
trace
of
emotion
such
are
the
effects
of
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
and
in
fact
of
the
whole
of
the
jewish
conception
of
nature
the
standard
recognized
by
the
hindus
and
buddhists
is
the
mahavakya
the
great
word
this
is
thyself
which
may
always
be
spoken
of
every
animal
to
keep
us
in
mind
of
the
identity
of
his
inmost
being
with
ours
perfection
of
morality
indeed
nonsense
the
fundamental
characteristics
of
the
jewish
religion
are
realism
and
optimism
views
of
the
world
which
are
closely
allied
they
form
in
fact
the
conditions
of
theism
for
theism
looks
upon
the
material
world
as
absolutely
real
and
regards
life
as
a
pleasant
gift
bestowed
upon
us
on
the
other
hand
the
fundamental
characteristics
of
the
brahman
and
buddhist
religions
are
idealism
and
pessimism
which
look
upon
the
existence
of
the
world
as
in
the
nature
of
a
dream
and
life
as
the
result
of
our
sins
in
the
doctrines
of
the
zendavesta
from
which
as
is
well
known
judaism
sprang
the
pessimistic
element
is
represented
by
ahriman
in
judaism
ahriman
has
as
satan
only
a
subordinate
position
but
like
ahriman
he
is
the
lord
of
snakes
scorpions
and
vermin
but
the
jewish
system
forthwith
employs
satan
to
correct
its
fundamental
error
of
optimism
and
in
the
introduces
the
element
of
pessimism
a
doctrine
demanded
by
the
most
obvious
facts
of
the
world
there
is
no
truer
idea
in
judaism
than
this
although
it
transfers
to
the
course
of
existence
what
must
be
represented
as
its
foundation
and
antecedent
the
new
testament
on
the
other
hand
must
be
in
some
way
traceable
to
an
indian
source
its
ethical
system
its
ascetic
view
of
morality
its
pessimism
and
its
avatar
are
all
thoroughly
indian
it
is
its
morality
which
places
it
in
a
position
of
such
emphatic
and
essential
antagonism
to
the
old
testament
so
that
the
story
of
the
fall
is
the
only
possible
point
of
connection
between
the
two
for
when
the
indian
doctrine
was
imported
into
the
land
of
promise
two
very
different
things
had
to
be
combined
on
the
one
hand
the
consciousness
of
the
corruption
and
misery
of
the
world
its
need
of
deliverance
and
salvation
through
an
avatar
together
with
a
morality
based
on
and
repentance
on
the
other
hand
the
jewish
doctrine
of
monotheism
with
its
corollary
that
all
things
are
very
good
greek
panta
kala
lian
and
the
task
succeeded
as
far
as
it
could
as
far
that
is
as
it
was
possible
to
combine
two
such
heterogeneous
and
antagonistic
creeds
as
ivy
clings
for
the
support
and
stay
it
wants
to
a
post
everywhere
conforming
to
its
irregularities
and
showing
their
outline
but
at
the
same
time
covering
them
with
life
and
grace
and
changing
the
former
aspect
into
one
that
is
pleasing
to
the
eye
so
the
christian
faith
sprung
from
the
wisdom
of
india
overspreads
the
old
trunk
of
rude
judaism
a
tree
of
alien
growth
the
original
form
must
in
part
remain
but
it
suffers
a
complete
change
and
becomes
full
of
life
and
truth
so
that
it
appears
to
be
the
same
tree
but
is
really
another
judaism
had
presented
the
creator
as
separated
from
the
world
which
he
produced
out
of
nothing
christianity
identifies
this
creator
with
the
saviour
and
through
him
with
humanity
he
stands
as
their
representative
they
are
redeemed
in
him
just
as
they
fell
in
adam
and
have
lain
ever
since
in
the
bonds
of
iniquity
corruption
suffering
and
death
such
is
the
view
taken
by
christianity
in
common
with
buddhism
the
world
can
no
longer
be
looked
at
in
the
light
of
jewish
optimism
which
found
all
things
very
good
nay
in
the
christian
scheme
the
devil
is
named
as
its
prince
or
ruler
greek
ho
archon
tou
kosmoutoutou
john
the
world
is
no
longer
an
end
but
a
means
and
the
realm
of
everlasting
joy
lies
beyond
it
and
the
grave
resignation
in
this
world
and
direction
of
all
our
hopes
to
a
better
form
the
spirit
of
christianity
the
way
to
this
end
is
opened
by
the
atonement
that
is
the
redemption
from
this
world
and
its
ways
and
in
the
moral
system
instead
of
the
law
of
vengeance
there
is
the
command
to
love
your
enemy
instead
of
the
promise
of
innumerable
posterity
the
assurance
of
eternal
life
instead
of
visiting
the
sins
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
to
the
third
and
fourth
generations
the
holy
spirit
governs
and
overshadows
all
we
see
then
that
the
doctrines
of
the
old
testament
are
rectified
and
their
meaning
changed
by
those
of
the
new
so
that
in
the
most
important
and
essential
matters
an
agreement
is
brought
about
between
them
and
the
old
religions
of
india
everything
which
is
true
in
christianity
may
also
be
found
in
brahmanism
and
buddhism
but
in
hinduism
and
buddhism
you
will
look
in
vain
for
any
parallel
to
the
jewish
doctrines
of
a
nothing
quickened
into
life
or
of
a
world
made
in
time
which
can
not
be
humble
enough
in
its
thanks
and
praises
to
jehovah
for
an
ephemeral
existence
full
of
misery
anguish
and
need
whoever
seriously
thinks
that
superhuman
beings
have
ever
given
our
race
information
as
to
the
aim
of
its
existence
and
that
of
the
world
is
still
in
his
childhood
there
is
no
other
revelation
than
the
thoughts
of
the
wise
even
though
these
thoughts
liable
to
error
as
is
the
lot
of
everything
human
are
often
clothed
in
strange
allegories
and
myths
under
the
name
of
religion
so
far
then
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
a
man
lives
and
dies
in
reliance
on
his
own
or
thoughts
for
it
is
never
more
than
human
thought
human
opinion
which
he
trusts
still
instead
of
trusting
what
their
own
minds
tell
them
men
have
as
a
rule
a
weakness
for
trusting
others
who
pretend
to
supernatural
sources
of
knowledge
and
in
view
of
the
enormous
intellectual
inequality
between
man
and
man
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
thoughts
of
one
mind
might
appear
as
in
some
sense
a
revelation
to
another
