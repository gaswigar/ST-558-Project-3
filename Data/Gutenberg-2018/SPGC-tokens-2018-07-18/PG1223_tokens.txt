dedication
to
mademoiselle
sophie
surville
it
is
a
true
pleasure
my
dear
niece
to
dedicate
to
you
this
book
the
subject
and
details
of
which
have
won
the
approbation
so
difficult
to
win
of
a
young
girl
to
whom
the
world
is
still
unknown
and
who
has
compromised
with
none
of
the
lofty
principles
of
a
saintly
education
young
girls
are
indeed
a
formidable
public
for
they
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
read
books
less
pure
than
the
purity
of
their
souls
they
are
forbidden
certain
reading
just
as
they
are
carefully
prevented
from
seeing
social
life
as
it
is
must
it
not
therefore
be
a
source
of
pride
to
a
writer
to
find
that
he
has
pleased
you
god
grant
that
your
affection
for
me
has
not
misled
you
who
can
tell
the
future
which
you
i
hope
will
see
though
not
perhaps

chapter
i
the
frightened
heirs
entering
nemours
by
the
road
to
paris
we
cross
the
canal
du
loing
the
steep
banks
of
which
serve
the
double
purpose
of
ramparts
to
the
fields
and
of
picturesque
promenades
for
the
inhabitants
of
that
pretty
little
town
since
several
houses
had
unfortunately
been
built
on
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
if
this
sort
of
suburb
increases
the
place
will
lose
its
present
aspect
of
graceful
originality
in
however
both
sides
of
the
road
were
clear
and
the
master
of
the
post
route
a
tall
stout
man
about
sixty
years
of
age
sitting
one
fine
autumn
morning
at
the
highest
part
of
the
bridge
could
take
in
at
a
glance
the
whole
of
what
is
called
in
his
business
a
ruban
de
the
month
of
september
was
displaying
its
treasures
the
atmosphere
glowed
above
the
grass
and
the
pebbles
no
cloud
dimmed
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
purity
of
which
in
all
parts
even
close
to
the
horizon
showed
the
extreme
rarefaction
of
the
air
so
for
that
was
the
post
master
s
name
was
obliged
to
shade
his
eyes
with
one
hand
to
keep
them
from
being
dazzled
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
tired
of
waiting
he
looked
first
to
the
charming
meadows
which
lay
to
the
right
of
the
road
where
the
aftermath
was
springing
up
then
to
the
covered
with
copses
which
extend
on
the
left
from
nemours
to
bouron
he
could
hear
in
the
valley
of
the
loing
where
the
sounds
on
the
road
were
echoed
back
from
the
hills
the
trot
of
his
own
horses
and
the
crack
of
his
postilion
s
whip
none
but
a
post
master
could
feel
impatient
within
sight
of
such
meadows
filled
with
cattle
worthy
of
paul
potter
and
glowing
beneath
a
raffaelle
sky
and
beside
a
canal
shaded
with
trees
after
hobbema
whoever
knows
nemours
knows
that
nature
is
there
as
beautiful
as
art
whose
mission
is
to
spiritualize
it
there
the
landscape
has
ideas
and
creates
thought
but
on
catching
sight
of
an
artist
would
very
likely
have
left
the
view
to
sketch
the
man
so
original
was
he
in
his
native
commonness
unite
in
a
human
being
all
the
conditions
of
the
brute
and
you
have
a
caliban
who
is
certainly
a
great
thing
wherever
form
rules
sentiment
disappears
the
post
master
a
living
proof
of
that
axiom
presented
a
physiognomy
in
which
an
observer
could
with
difficulty
trace
beneath
the
vivid
carnation
of
its
coarsely
developed
flesh
the
semblance
of
a
soul
his
cap
of
blue
cloth
with
a
small
peak
and
sides
fluted
like
a
melon
outlined
a
head
of
vast
dimensions
showing
that
gall
s
science
has
not
yet
produced
its
chapter
of
exceptions
the
gray
and
rather
shiny
hair
which
appeared
below
the
cap
showed
that
other
causes
than
mental
toil
or
grief
had
whitened
it
large
ears
stood
out
from
the
head
their
edges
scarred
with
the
eruptions
of
his
blood
which
seemed
ready
to
gush
at
the
least
exertion
his
skin
was
crimson
under
an
outside
layer
of
brown
due
to
the
habit
of
standing
in
the
sun
the
roving
gray
eyes
and
hidden
by
bushy
black
brows
were
like
those
of
the
kalmucks
who
entered
france
in
if
they
ever
sparkled
it
was
only
under
the
influence
of
a
covetous
thought
his
broad
pug
nose
was
flattened
at
the
base
thick
lips
in
keeping
with
a
repulsive
double
chin
the
beard
of
which
rarely
cleaned
more
than
once
a
week
was
encircled
with
a
dirty
silk
handkerchief
twisted
to
a
cord
a
short
neck
rolling
in
fat
and
heavy
cheeks
completed
the
characteristics
of
brute
force
which
sculptors
give
to
their
caryatids
was
like
those
statues
with
this
difference
that
whereas
they
supported
an
edifice
he
had
more
than
he
could
well
do
to
support
himself
you
will
meet
many
such
atlases
in
the
world
the
man
s
torso
was
a
block
it
was
like
that
of
a
bull
standing
on
his
his
vigorous
arms
ended
in
a
pair
of
thick
hard
hands
broad
and
strong
and
well
able
to
handle
whip
reins
and
pitchfork
hands
which
his
postilions
never
attempted
to
trifle
with
the
enormous
stomach
of
this
giant
rested
on
thighs
which
were
as
large
as
the
body
of
an
ordinary
adult
and
feet
like
those
of
an
elephant
anger
was
a
rare
thing
with
him
but
it
was
terrible
apoplectic
when
it
did
burst
forth
though
violent
and
quite
incapable
of
reflection
the
man
had
never
done
anything
that
justified
the
sinister
suggestions
of
his
bodily
presence
to
all
those
who
felt
afraid
of
him
his
postilions
would
reply
oh
he
s
not
the
master
of
nemours
to
use
the
common
abbreviation
of
the
country
wore
a
velveteen
of
trousers
of
green
linen
with
great
stripes
and
an
ample
yellow
waistcoat
of
goat
s
skin
in
the
pocket
of
which
might
be
discerned
the
round
outline
of
a
monstrous
a
to
a
pug
nose
is
a
law
without
exception
a
son
of
the
revolution
and
a
spectator
of
the
empire
did
not
meddle
with
politics
as
to
his
religious
opinions
he
had
never
set
foot
in
a
church
except
to
be
married
as
to
his
private
principles
he
kept
them
within
the
civil
code
all
that
the
law
did
not
forbid
or
could
not
prevent
he
considered
right
he
never
read
anything
but
the
journal
of
the
department
of
the
and
a
few
printed
instructions
relating
to
his
business
he
was
considered
a
clever
agriculturist
but
his
knowledge
was
only
practical
in
him
the
moral
being
did
not
belie
the
physical
he
seldom
spoke
and
before
speaking
he
always
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
to
give
himself
time
not
to
find
ideas
but
words
if
he
had
been
a
talker
you
would
have
felt
that
he
was
out
of
keeping
with
himself
reflecting
that
this
elephant
minus
a
trumpet
and
without
a
mind
was
called
we
are
compelled
to
agree
with
sterne
as
to
the
occult
power
of
names
which
sometimes
ridicule
and
sometimes
foretell
characters
in
spite
of
his
visible
incapacity
he
had
acquired
during
the
last
years
the
revolution
helping
him
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
francs
derived
from
farm
lands
woods
and
meadows
if
minoret
being
master
of
the
of
nemours
and
those
of
the
gatinais
to
paris
still
worked
at
his
business
it
was
less
from
habit
than
for
the
sake
of
an
only
son
to
whom
he
was
anxious
to
give
a
fine
career
this
son
who
was
now
to
use
an
expression
of
the
peasantry
a
monsieur
had
just
completed
his
legal
studies
and
was
about
to
take
his
degree
as
licentiate
preparatory
to
being
called
to
the
bar
monsieur
and
madame
for
behind
our
colossus
every
one
will
perceive
a
woman
without
whom
this
signal
would
have
been
impossible
left
their
son
free
to
choose
his
own
career
he
might
be
a
notary
in
paris
king
in
some
district
collector
of
customs
no
matter
where
broker
or
post
master
as
he
pleased
what
fancy
of
his
could
they
ever
refuse
him
to
what
position
of
life
might
he
not
aspire
as
the
son
of
a
man
about
whom
the
whole
countryside
from
montargis
to
essonne
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
pere
minoret
doesn
t
even
know
how
rich
he
is
this
saying
had
obtained
fresh
force
about
four
years
before
this
history
begins
when
minoret
after
selling
his
inn
built
stables
and
a
splendid
dwelling
and
removed
the
from
the
grand
rue
to
the
wharf
the
new
establishment
cost
two
hundred
thousand
francs
which
the
gossip
of
thirty
miles
in
circumference
more
than
doubled
the
nemours
service
requires
a
large
number
of
horses
it
goes
to
fontainebleau
on
the
road
to
paris
and
from
there
diverges
to
montargis
and
also
to
montereau
the
relays
are
long
and
the
sandy
soil
of
the
montargis
road
calls
for
the
mythical
third
horse
always
paid
for
but
never
seen
a
man
of
minoret
s
build
and
minoret
s
wealth
at
the
head
of
such
an
establishment
might
well
be
called
without
contradiction
the
master
of
nemours
though
he
never
thought
of
god
or
devil
being
a
practical
materialist
just
as
he
was
a
practical
agriculturist
a
practical
egoist
and
a
practical
miser
minoret
had
enjoyed
up
to
this
time
a
life
of
unmixed
happiness
if
we
can
call
pure
materialism
happiness
a
physiologist
observing
the
rolls
of
flesh
which
covered
the
last
vertebrae
and
pressed
upon
the
giant
s
cerebellum
and
above
all
hearing
the
shrill
sharp
voice
which
contrasted
so
absurdly
with
his
huge
body
would
have
understood
why
this
ponderous
coarse
being
adored
his
only
son
and
why
he
had
so
long
expected
him
a
fact
proved
by
the
name
desire
which
was
given
to
the
child
the
mother
whom
the
boy
fortunately
resembled
rivaled
the
father
in
spoiling
him
no
child
could
long
have
resisted
the
effects
of
such
idolatry
as
soon
as
desire
knew
the
extent
of
his
power
he
milked
his
mother
s
coffer
and
dipped
into
his
father
s
purse
making
each
author
of
his
being
believe
that
he
or
she
alone
was
petitioned
desire
who
played
a
part
in
nemours
far
beyond
that
of
a
prince
royal
in
his
father
s
capital
chose
to
gratify
his
fancies
in
paris
just
as
he
had
gratified
them
in
his
native
town
he
had
therefore
spent
a
yearly
sum
of
not
less
than
twelve
thousand
francs
during
the
time
of
his
legal
studies
but
for
that
money
he
had
certainly
acquired
ideas
that
would
never
had
come
to
him
in
nemours
he
had
stripped
off
the
provincial
skin
learned
the
power
of
money
and
seen
in
the
magistracy
a
means
of
advancement
which
he
fancied
during
the
last
year
he
had
spent
an
extra
sum
of
ten
thousand
francs
in
the
company
of
artists
journalists
and
their
mistresses
a
confidential
and
rather
disquieting
letter
from
his
son
asking
for
his
consent
to
a
marriage
explains
the
watch
which
the
post
master
was
now
keeping
on
the
bridge
for
madame
busy
in
preparing
a
sumptuous
breakfast
to
celebrate
the
triumphal
return
of
the
licentiate
had
sent
her
husband
to
the
mail
road
advising
him
to
take
a
horse
and
ride
out
if
he
saw
nothing
of
the
diligence
the
coach
which
was
conveying
the
precious
son
usually
arrived
at
five
in
the
morning
and
it
was
now
nine
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
such
delay
was
the
coach
overturned
could
desire
be
dead
or
was
it
nothing
worse
than
a
broken
leg
three
distinct
volleys
of
cracking
whips
rent
the
air
like
a
discharge
of
musketry
the
red
waistcoats
of
the
postilions
dawned
in
sight
ten
horses
neighed
the
master
pulled
off
his
cap
and
waved
it
he
was
seen
the
best
mounted
postilion
who
was
returning
with
two
gray
set
spurs
to
his
beast
and
came
on
in
advance
of
the
five
diligence
horses
and
the
three
other
and
soon
reached
his
master
have
you
seen
the
ducler
on
the
great
mail
routes
names
often
fantastic
are
given
to
the
different
coaches
such
for
instance
as
the
caillard
the
ducler
the
coach
between
nemours
and
paris
the
grand
every
new
enterprise
is
called
the
in
the
days
of
the
lecompte
company
their
coaches
were
called
the
caillard
could
not
overtake
the
countess
but
grand
bureau
caught
up
with
her
finely
you
will
hear
the
men
say
if
you
see
a
postilion
pressing
his
horses
and
refusing
a
glass
of
wine
question
the
conductor
and
he
will
tell
you
snuffing
the
air
while
his
eye
gazes
far
into
space
the
competition
is
we
can
t
get
in
sight
of
her
cries
the
postilion
the
vixen
she
wouldn
t
stop
to
let
her
passengers
the
question
is
has
she
got
any
responds
the
conductor
give
it
to
polignac
all
lazy
and
bad
horses
are
called
polignac
such
are
the
jokes
and
the
basis
of
conversation
between
postilions
and
conductors
on
the
roofs
of
the
coaches
each
profession
each
calling
in
france
has
its
slang
have
you
seen
the
ducler
asked
minoret
monsieur
desire
said
the
postilion
interrupting
his
master
hey
you
must
have
heard
us
didn
t
our
whips
tell
you
we
felt
you
were
somewhere
along
the
just
then
a
woman
dressed
in
her
sunday
clothes
for
the
bells
were
pealing
from
the
clock
tower
and
calling
the
inhabitants
to
mass
a
woman
about
years
of
age
came
up
to
the
post
master
well
cousin
she
said
you
wouldn
t
believe
me
uncle
is
with
ursula
in
the
grand
rue
and
they
are
going
to
in
spite
of
the
modern
poetic
canons
as
to
local
color
it
is
quite
impossible
to
push
realism
so
far
as
to
repeat
the
horrible
blasphemy
mingled
with
oaths
which
this
news
apparently
so
unexciting
brought
from
the
huge
mouth
of
his
shrill
voice
grew
sibilant
and
his
face
took
on
the
appearance
of
what
people
oddly
enough
call
a
sunstroke
is
that
true
he
asked
after
the
first
explosion
of
his
wrath
was
over
the
postilions
bowed
to
their
master
as
they
and
their
horses
passed
him
but
he
seemed
to
neither
see
nor
hear
them
instead
of
waiting
for
his
son
hurried
up
to
the
grand
rue
with
his
cousin
didn
t
i
always
tell
you
so
she
resumed
when
doctor
minoret
goes
out
of
his
head
that
demure
little
hypocrite
will
drag
him
into
religion
whoever
lays
hold
of
the
mind
gets
hold
of
the
purse
and
she
ll
have
our
but
madame
massin
said
the
post
master
dumbfounded
there
now
exclaimed
madame
massin
interrupting
her
cousin
you
are
going
to
say
just
as
massin
does
that
a
little
girl
of
fifteen
can
t
invent
such
plans
and
carry
them
out
or
make
an
old
man
of
who
has
never
set
foot
in
a
church
except
to
be
married
change
his
opinions
now
don
t
tell
me
he
has
such
a
horror
of
priests
that
he
wouldn
t
even
go
with
the
girl
to
the
parish
church
when
she
made
her
first
communion
i
d
like
to
know
why
if
doctor
minoret
hates
priests
he
has
spent
nearly
every
evening
for
the
last
fifteen
years
of
his
life
with
the
abbe
chaperon
the
old
hypocrite
never
fails
to
give
ursula
twenty
francs
for
wax
tapers
every
time
she
takes
the
sacrament
have
you
forgotten
the
gift
ursula
made
to
the
church
in
gratitude
to
the
cure
for
preparing
her
for
her
first
communion
she
spent
all
her
money
on
it
and
her
godfather
returned
it
to
her
doubled
you
men
you
don
t
pay
attention
to
things
when
i
heard
that
i
said
to
myself
farewell
baskets
the
vintage
is
done
a
rich
uncle
doesn
t
behave
that
way
to
a
little
brat
picked
up
in
the
streets
without
some
good
pooh
cousin
i
dare
say
the
good
man
is
only
taking
her
to
the
door
of
the
church
replied
the
post

it
is
a
fine
day

he
is
out
for
a

tell
you
he
is
holding
a
and
looks
sanctimonious
you
ll
see
they
hide
their
game
pretty
well
said
minoret
la
bougival
told
me
there
was
never
any
talk
of
religion
between
the
doctor
and
the
abbe
besides
the
abbe
is
one
of
the
most
honest
men
on
the
face
of
the
globe
he
d
give
the
shirt
off
his
back
to
a
poor
man
he
is
incapable
of
a
base
action
and
to
cheat
a
family
out
of
their
inheritance
is
theft
said
madame
massin
worse
cried
exasperated
by
the
tongue
of
his
gossiping
neighbour
of
course
i
know
said
madame
massin
that
the
abbe
chaperon
is
an
honest
man
but
he
is
capable
of
anything
for
the
sake
of
his
poor
he
must
have
mined
and
undermined
uncle
and
the
old
man
has
just
tumbled
into
piety
we
did
nothing
and
here
he
is
perverted
a
man
who
never
believed
in
anything
and
had
principles
of
his
own
well
we
re
done
for
my
husband
is
absolutely
beside
madame
massin
whose
sentences
were
so
many
arrows
stinging
her
fat
cousin
made
him
walk
as
fast
as
herself
in
spite
of
his
obesity
and
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
who
were
on
their
way
to
mass
she
was
determined
to
overtake
this
uncle
and
show
him
to
the
post
master
nemours
is
commanded
on
the
gatinais
side
by
a
hill
at
the
foot
of
which
runs
the
road
to
montargis
and
the
loing
the
church
on
the
stones
of
which
time
has
cast
a
rich
discolored
mantle
it
was
rebuilt
in
the
fourteenth
century
by
the
guises
for
whom
nemours
was
raised
to
a
stands
at
the
end
of
the
little
town
close
to
a
great
arch
which
frames
it
for
buildings
as
for
men
position
does
everything
shaded
by
a
few
trees
and
thrown
into
relief
by
a
neatly
kept
square
this
solitary
church
produces
a
really
grandiose
effect
as
the
post
master
of
nemours
entered
the
open
space
he
beheld
his
uncle
with
the
young
girl
called
ursula
on
his
arm
both
carrying
and
just
entering
the
church
the
old
man
took
off
his
hat
in
the
porch
and
his
head
which
was
white
as
a
covered
with
snow
shone
among
the
shadows
of
the
portal
well
minoret
what
do
you
say
to
the
conversion
of
your
uncle
cried
the
of
nemours
named
cremiere
what
do
you
expect
me
to
say
replied
the
post
master
offering
him
a
pinch
of
snuff
well
answered
pere
levrault
you
can
t
say
what
you
think
if
it
is
true
as
an
illustrious
author
says
it
is
that
a
man
must
think
his
words
before
he
speaks
his
thoughts
cried
a
young
man
standing
near
who
played
the
part
of
mephistopheles
in
the
little
town
this
youth
named
goupil
was
head
clerk
to
monsieur
the
nemours
notary
notwithstanding
a
past
conduct
that
was
almost
debauched
dionis
had
taken
goupil
into
his
office
when
a
career
in
paris
where
the
clerk
had
wasted
all
the
money
he
inherited
from
his
father
a
farmer
who
educated
him
for
a
notary
was
brought
to
a
close
by
his
absolute
pauperism
the
mere
sight
of
goupil
told
an
observer
that
he
had
made
haste
to
enjoy
life
and
had
paid
dear
for
his
enjoyments
though
very
short
his
chest
and
shoulders
were
developed
at
years
of
age
like
those
of
a
man
of
forty
legs
small
and
weak
and
a
broad
face
with
a
cloudy
complexion
like
the
sky
before
a
storm
surmounted
by
a
bald
forehead
brought
out
still
further
the
oddity
of
his
conformation
his
face
seemed
as
though
it
belonged
to
a
hunchback
whose
hunch
was
inside
of
him
one
singularity
of
that
pale
and
sour
visage
confirmed
the
impression
of
an
invisible
gobbosity
the
nose
crooked
and
out
of
shape
like
those
of
many
deformed
persons
turned
from
right
to
left
of
the
face
instead
of
dividing
it
down
the
middle
the
mouth
contracted
at
the
corners
like
that
of
a
sardinian
was
always
on
the
qui
vive
of
irony
his
hair
thin
and
reddish
fell
straight
and
showed
the
skull
in
many
places
his
hands
coarse
and
at
the
wrists
to
arms
that
were
far
too
long
were
and
seldom
clean
goupil
wore
boots
only
fit
for
the
and
raw
silk
stockings
now
of
a
russet
black
his
coat
and
trousers
all
black
and
threadbare
and
greasy
with
dirt
his
pitiful
waistcoat
with
half
the
gone
an
old
silk
handkerchief
which
served
as
a
cravat
in
short
all
his
clothing
revealed
the
cynical
poverty
to
which
his
passions
had
reduced
him
this
combination
of
disreputable
signs
was
guarded
by
a
pair
of
eyes
with
yellow
circles
round
the
pupils
like
those
of
a
goat
both
lascivious
and
cowardly
no
one
in
nemours
was
more
feared
nor
in
a
way
more
deferred
to
than
goupil
strong
in
the
claims
made
for
him
by
his
very
ugliness
he
had
the
odious
style
of
wit
peculiar
to
men
who
allow
themselves
all
license
and
he
used
it
to
gratify
the
bitterness
of
his
envy
he
wrote
the
satirical
couplets
sung
during
the
carnival
organized
charivaris
and
was
himself
a
little
journal
of
the
gossip
of
the
town
dionis
who
was
clever
and
insincere
and
for
that
reason
timid
kept
goupil
as
much
through
fear
as
for
his
keen
mind
and
thorough
knowledge
of
all
the
interests
of
the
town
but
the
master
so
distrusted
his
clerk
that
he
himself
kept
the
accounts
refused
to
let
him
live
in
his
house
held
him
at
arm
s
length
and
never
confided
any
secret
or
delicate
affair
to
his
keeping
in
return
the
clerk
fawned
upon
the
notary
hiding
his
resentment
at
this
conduct
and
watching
madame
dionis
in
the
hope
that
he
might
get
his
revenge
there
gifted
with
a
ready
mind
and
quick
comprehension
he
found
work
easy
you
exclaimed
the
post
master
to
the
clerk
who
stood
rubbing
his
hands
making
game
of
our
misfortunes
already
as
goupil
was
known
to
have
pandered
to
dionis
passions
for
the
last
five
years
the
post
master
treated
him
cavalierly
without
suspecting
the
hoard
of
he
was
piling
up
in
goupil
s
heart
with
every
fresh
insult
the
clerk
convinced
that
money
was
more
necessary
to
him
than
it
was
to
others
and
knowing
himself
superior
in
mind
to
the
whole
bourgeoisie
of
nemours
was
now
counting
on
his
intimacy
with
minoret
s
son
desire
to
obtain
the
means
of
buying
one
or
the
other
of
three
town
offices
that
of
clerk
of
the
court
or
the
legal
practice
of
one
of
the
sheriffs
or
that
of
dionis
himself
for
this
reason
he
put
up
with
the
affronts
of
the
post
master
and
the
contempt
of
madame
and
played
a
contemptible
part
towards
desire
consoling
the
fair
victims
whom
that
youth
left
behind
him
after
each
vacation
devouring
the
crumbs
of
the
loaves
he
had
kneaded
if
i
were
the
nephew
of
a
rich
old
fellow
he
never
would
have
given
god
to
me
for
a
retorted
goupil
with
a
hideous
grin
which
exhibited
his
teeth
few
black
and
menacing
just
then
junior
the
clerk
of
the
court
joined
his
wife
bringing
with
him
madame
cremiere
the
wife
of
the
of
nemours
this
man
one
of
the
hardest
natures
of
the
little
town
had
the
physical
characteristics
of
a
tartar
eyes
small
and
round
as
sloes
beneath
a
retreating
brow
crimped
hair
an
oily
skin
huge
ears
without
any
rim
a
mouth
almost
without
lips
and
a
scanty
beard
he
spoke
like
a
man
who
was
losing
his
voice
to
exhibit
him
thoroughly
it
is
enough
to
say
that
he
employed
his
wife
and
eldest
daughter
to
serve
his
legal
notices
madame
cremiere
was
a
stout
woman
with
a
fair
complexion
injured
by
red
blotches
always
too
tightly
laced
intimate
with
madame
dionis
and
supposed
to
be
educated
because
she
read
novels
full
of
pretensions
to
wit
and
elegance
she
was
awaiting
her
uncle
s
money
to
take
a
certain
stand
decorate
her
salon
and
receive
the
bourgeoisie
at
present
her
husband
denied
her
carcel
lamps
lithographs
and
all
the
other
trifles
the
notary
s
wife
possessed
she
was
excessively
afraid
of
goupil
who
caught
up
and
retailed
her
as
she
called
them
one
day
madame
dionis
chanced
to
ask
what
eau
she
thought
best
for
the
teeth
try
opium
she
replied
nearly
all
the
collateral
heirs
of
old
doctor
minoret
were
now
assembled
in
the
square
the
importance
of
the
event
which
brought
them
was
so
generally
felt
that
even
groups
of
peasants
armed
with
their
scarlet
umbrellas
and
dressed
in
those
brilliant
colors
which
make
them
so
picturesque
on
sundays
and
stood
by
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
frightened
heirs
in
all
little
towns
which
are
midway
between
large
villages
and
cities
those
who
do
not
go
to
mass
stand
about
in
the
square
or
business
is
talked
over
in
nemours
the
hour
of
church
service
was
a
weekly
exchange
to
which
the
owners
of
property
scattered
over
a
radius
of
some
miles
resorted
well
how
would
you
have
prevented
it
said
the
post
master
to
goupil
in
reply
to
his
remark
i
should
have
made
myself
as
important
to
him
as
the
air
he
breathes
but
from
the
very
first
you
failed
to
get
hold
of
him
the
inheritance
of
a
rich
uncle
should
be
watched
as
carefully
as
a
pretty
woman
for
want
of
proper
care
they
ll
both
escape
you
if
madame
dionis
were
here
she
could
tell
you
how
true
that
comparison
but
monsieur
bongrand
has
just
told
me
there
is
nothing
to
worry
about
said
massin
oh
there
are
plenty
of
ways
of
saying
that
cried
goupil
laughing
i
would
like
to
have
heard
your
sly
justice
of
the
peace
say
it
if
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
if
he
being
intimate
with
your
uncle
knows
that
all
is
lost
the
proper
thing
for
him
to
say
to
you
is
don
t
be
as
goupil
spoke
a
satirical
smile
overspread
his
face
and
gave
such
meaning
to
his
words
that
the
other
heirs
began
to
feel
that
massin
had
let
bongrand
deceive
him
the
a
fat
little
man
as
insignificant
as
a
should
be
and
as
much
of
a
cipher
as
a
clever
woman
could
wish
hereupon
annihilated
his
massin
with
the
words
didn
t
i
tell
you
so
tricky
people
always
attribute
trickiness
to
others
massin
therefore
looked
askance
at
monsieur
bongrand
the
justice
of
the
peace
who
was
at
that
moment
talking
near
the
door
of
the
church
with
the
marquis
du
rouvre
a
former
client
if
i
were
sure
of
it
he
said
you
could
neutralize
the
protection
he
is
now
giving
to
the
marquis
du
rouvre
who
is
threatened
with
arrest
don
t
you
see
how
bongrand
is
sprinkling
him
with
advice
said
goupil
slipping
an
idea
of
retaliation
into
massin
s
mind
but
you
had
better
go
easy
with
your
chief
he
s
a
clever
old
fellow
he
might
use
his
influence
with
your
uncle
and
persuade
him
not
to
leave
everything
to
the
pooh
we
sha
n
t
die
of
it
said
opening
his
enormous
you
won
t
live
of
it
either
said
goupil
making
the
two
women
tremble
more
than
their
husbands
they
saw
the
privations
this
loss
of
inheritance
so
long
counted
on
for
many
comforts
would
be
to
them
however
added
goupil
we
ll
drown
this
little
grief
in
floods
of
champagne
in
honor
of
desire
sha
n
t
we
old
fellow
he
cried
tapping
the
stomach
of
the
giant
and
inviting
himself
to
the
feast
for
fear
he
should
be
left
out
chapter
ii
the
rich
uncle
before
proceeding
further
persons
of
an
exact
turn
of
mind
may
like
to
read
a
species
of
family
inventory
so
as
to
understand
the
degrees
of
relationship
which
connected
the
old
man
thus
suddenly
converted
to
religion
with
these
three
heads
of
families
or
their
wives
this
of
families
in
the
remote
provinces
might
be
made
the
subject
of
many
instructive
reflections
there
are
but
three
or
four
houses
of
the
lesser
nobility
in
nemours
among
them
at
the
period
of
which
we
write
that
of
the
family
of
portenduere
was
the
most
important
these
exclusives
visited
none
but
nobles
who
possessed
lands
or
chateaus
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
latter
we
may
mention
the
d
aiglemonts
owners
of
the
beautiful
estate
of
and
the
marquis
du
rouvre
whose
property
crippled
by
mortgages
was
closely
watched
by
the
bourgeoisie
the
nobles
of
the
town
had
no
money
madame
de
portenduere
s
sole
possessions
were
a
farm
which
brought
a
rental
of
hundred
francs
and
her
town
house
in
opposition
to
this
very
insignificant
faubourg
germain
was
a
group
of
a
dozen
rich
families
those
of
retired
millers
or
former
merchants
in
short
a
miniature
bourgeoisie
below
which
again
lived
and
moved
the
retail
shopkeepers
the
proletaries
and
the
peasantry
the
bourgeoisie
presented
like
that
of
the
swiss
cantons
and
of
other
small
countries
the
curious
spectacle
of
the
ramifications
of
certain
autochthonous
families
and
unpolished
perhaps
but
who
rule
a
whole
region
and
pervade
it
until
nearly
all
its
inhabitants
are
cousins
under
louis
an
epoch
at
which
the
commons
first
made
real
names
of
their
surnames
some
of
which
are
united
with
those
of
feudalism
the
bourgeoisie
of
nemours
was
made
up
of
minorets
massins
levraults
and
cremieres
under
louis
xiii
these
four
families
had
already
produced
the
the
the
the
the
the
and
all
these
varied
with
juniors
and
diversified
with
the
names
of
eldest
sons
as
for
instance
enough
to
drive
a
pere
anselme
of
the
people
frantic
if
the
people
should
ever
want
a
genealogist
the
variations
of
this
family
kaleidoscope
of
four
branches
was
now
so
complicated
by
births
and
marriages
that
the
genealogical
tree
of
the
bourgeoisie
of
nemours
would
have
puzzled
the
benedictines
of
the
almanach
of
gotha
in
spite
of
the
atomic
science
with
which
they
arrange
those
zigzags
of
german
alliances
for
a
long
time
the
minorets
occupied
the
tanneries
the
cremieres
kept
the
mills
the
massins
were
in
trade
and
the
levraults
continued
farmers
fortunately
for
the
neighbourhood
these
four
stocks
threw
out
suckers
instead
of
depending
only
on
their
they
scattered
cuttings
by
the
expatriation
of
sons
who
sought
their
fortune
elsewhere
for
instance
there
are
minorets
who
are
cutlers
at
melun
levraults
at
montargis
massins
at
orleans
and
cremieres
of
some
importance
in
paris
divers
are
the
destinies
of
these
bees
from
the
parent
hive
rich
massins
employ
of
course
the
poor
working
massins
just
as
austria
and
prussia
take
the
german
princes
into
their
service
it
may
happen
that
a
public
office
is
managed
by
a
minoret
millionaire
and
guarded
by
a
minoret
sentinel
full
of
the
same
blood
and
called
by
the
same
name
for
sole
likeness
these
four
roots
had
ceaselessly
woven
a
human
network
of
which
each
thread
was
delicate
or
strong
fine
or
coarse
as
the
case
might
be
the
same
blood
was
in
the
head
and
in
the
feet
and
in
the
heart
in
the
working
hands
in
the
weakly
lungs
in
the
forehead
big
with
genius
the
chiefs
of
the
clan
were
faithful
to
the
little
town
where
the
ties
of
family
were
relaxed
or
tightened
according
to
the
events
which
happened
under
this
curious
cognomenism
in
whatever
part
of
france
you
may
be
you
will
find
the
same
thing
under
changed
names
but
without
the
poetic
charm
which
feudalism
gave
to
it
and
which
walter
scott
s
genius
reproduced
so
faithfully
let
us
look
a
little
higher
and
examine
humanity
as
it
appears
in
history
all
the
noble
families
of
the
eleventh
century
most
of
them
except
the
royal
race

need
only
search
back
through

see
their
accumulation

increases
into
a
retrograde
geometric
progression

multiplies

calculation
of
the

of

produced
the

of
the
two
races
almost
reunited
are
face
to
face
with
collaterals
without
a
heritage
what
are
they
to
do
our
political
future
is
big
with
the
answer
the
family
of
the
man
who
under
louis
xv
was
simply
called
minoret
was
so
numerous
that
one
of
the
five
children
the
minoret
whose
entrance
into
the
parish
church
caused
such
interest
went
to
paris
to
seek
his
fortune
and
seldom
returned
to
his
native
town
until
he
came
to
receive
his
share
of
the
inheritance
of
his
grandfather
after
suffering
many
things
like
all
young
men
of
firm
will
who
struggle
for
a
place
in
the
brilliant
world
of
paris
this
son
of
the
minorets
reached
a
nobler
destiny
than
he
had
perhaps
dreamed
of
at
the
start
he
devoted
himself
in
the
first
instance
to
medicine
a
profession
which
demands
both
talent
and
a
cheerful
nature
but
the
latter
qualification
even
more
than
talent
backed
by
dupont
de
nemours
connected
by
a
lucky
chance
with
the
abbe
morellet
whom
voltaire
nicknamed
and
protected
by
the
encyclopedists
doctor
minoret
attached
himself
as
liegeman
to
the
famous
doctor
bordeu
the
friend
of
diderot
d
alembert
helvetius
the
baron
d
holbach
and
grimm
in
whose
presence
he
felt
himself
a
mere
boy
these
men
influenced
by
bordeu
s
example
became
interested
in
minoret
who
about
the
year
found
himself
with
a
very
good
practice
among
deists
encyclopedists
sensualists
materialists
or
whatever
you
are
pleased
to
call
the
rich
philosophers
of
that
period
though
minoret
was
very
little
of
a
humbug
he
invented
the
famous
balm
of
lelievre
so
much
extolled
by
the
mercure
de
france
the
weekly
organ
of
the
encyclopedists
in
whose
columns
it
was
permanently
advertised
the
apothecary
lelievre
a
clever
man
saw
a
stroke
of
business
where
minoret
had
only
seen
a
new
preparation
for
the
dispensary
and
he
loyally
shared
his
profits
with
the
doctor
who
was
a
pupil
of
rouelle
in
chemistry
as
well
as
of
bordeu
in
medicine
less
than
that
would
make
a
man
a
materialist
the
doctor
married
for
love
in
during
the
reign
of
the
nouvelle
heloise
when
persons
did
occasionally
marry
for
that
reason
his
wife
was
a
daughter
of
the
famous
harpsichordist
valentin
mirouet
a
celebrated
musician
frail
and
delicate
whom
the
revolution
slew
minoret
knew
robespierre
intimately
for
he
had
once
been
instrumental
in
awarding
him
a
gold
medal
for
a
dissertation
on
the
following
subject
what
is
the
origin
of
the
opinion
that
covers
a
whole
family
with
the
shame
attaching
to
the
public
punishment
of
a
guilty
member
of
it
is
that
opinion
more
harmful
than
useful
if
yes
in
what
way
can
the
harm
be
warded
the
royal
academy
of
arts
and
sciences
at
metz
to
which
minoret
belonged
must
possess
this
dissertation
in
the
original
though
thanks
to
this
friendship
the
doctor
s
wife
need
have
had
no
fear
she
was
so
in
dread
of
going
to
the
scaffold
that
her
terror
increased
a
disposition
to
heart
disease
caused
by
the
of
her
nature
in
spite
of
all
the
precautions
taken
by
the
man
who
idolized
her
ursula
unfortunately
met
the
tumbril
of
victims
among
whom
was
madame
roland
and
the
shock
caused
her
death
minoret
who
in
tenderness
to
his
wife
had
refused
her
nothing
and
had
given
her
a
life
of
luxury
found
himself
after
her
death
almost
a
poor
man
robespierre
gave
him
an
appointment
as
of
a
hospital
though
the
name
of
minoret
obtained
during
the
lively
debates
to
which
mesmerism
gave
rise
a
certain
celebrity
which
occasionally
recalled
him
to
the
minds
of
his
relatives
still
the
revolution
was
so
great
a
destroyer
of
family
relations
that
in
nemours
knew
little
of
doctor
minoret
who
was
induced
to
think
of
returning
there
to
die
like
the
hare
to
its
form
by
a
circumstance
that
was
wholly
accidental
who
has
not
felt
in
traveling
through
france
where
the
eye
is
often
wearied
by
the
monotony
of
plains
the
charming
sensation
of
coming
suddenly
when
the
eye
is
prepared
for
a
barren
landscape
upon
a
fresh
cool
valley
watered
by
a
river
with
a
little
town
sheltering
beneath
a
cliff
like
a
swarm
of
bees
in
the
hollow
of
an
old
willow
wakened
by
the
hu
hu
of
the
postilion
as
he
walks
beside
his
horses
we
shake
off
sleep
and
admire
like
a
dream
within
a
dream
the
beautiful
scene
which
is
to
the
traveler
what
a
noble
passage
in
a
book
is
to
a
reader
a
brilliant
thought
of
nature
such
is
the
sensation
caused
by
a
first
sight
of
nemours
as
we
approach
it
from
burgundy
we
see
it
encircled
with
bare
rocks
gray
black
white
fantastic
in
shape
like
those
we
find
in
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
from
them
spring
scattered
trees
clearly
defined
against
the
sky
which
give
to
this
particular
rock
formation
the
dilapidated
look
of
a
crumbling
wall
here
ends
the
long
wooded
hill
which
creeps
from
nemours
to
bouron
skirting
the
road
at
the
bottom
of
this
irregular
amphitheater
lie
through
which
flows
the
loing
forming
sheets
of
water
with
many
falls
this
delightful
landscape
which
continues
the
whole
way
to
montargis
is
like
an
opera
scene
for
its
effects
really
seem
to
have
been
studied
one
morning
doctor
minoret
who
had
been
summoned
into
burgundy
by
a
rich
patient
was
returning
in
all
haste
to
paris
not
having
mentioned
at
the
last
relay
the
route
he
intended
to
take
he
was
brought
without
his
knowledge
through
nemours
and
beheld
once
more
on
waking
from
a
nap
the
scenery
in
which
his
childhood
had
been
passed
he
had
lately
lost
many
of
his
old
friends
the
votary
of
the
encyclopedists
had
witnessed
the
conversion
of
la
harpe
he
had
buried
and
de
chenier
and
morellet
and
madame
helvetius
he
assisted
at
the
of
voltaire
when
assailed
by
geoffroy
the
continuator
of
freton
for
some
time
past
he
had
thought
of
retiring
and
so
when
his
post
chaise
stopped
at
the
head
of
the
grand
rue
of
nemours
his
heart
prompted
him
to
inquire
for
his
family
the
post
master
came
forward
himself
to
see
the
doctor
who
discovered
him
to
be
the
son
of
his
eldest
brother
the
nephew
presented
the
doctor
to
his
wife
the
only
daughter
of
the
late
who
had
died
twelve
years
earlier
leaving
him
the
post
business
and
the
finest
inn
in
nemours
well

doctor

my
mother
was
a

there

only
one
left
answered
namely
who

monsieur
a
purveyor
of
forage
who

on

scaffold

and
without
a

a
a
farmer
at

who

doing
well
their
daughter
has
just
married
a
notary
s
clerk
at
montargis
where
his
father
is
a
so
i
ve
plenty
of
heirs
said
the
doctor
gayly
immediately
proposing
to
take
a
walk
through
nemours
accompanied
by
his
nephew
the
loing
runs
through
the
town
in
a
waving
line
banked
by
terraced
gardens
and
neat
houses
the
aspect
of
which
makes
one
fancy
that
happiness
must
abide
there
sooner
than
elsewhere
when
the
doctor
turned
into
the
rue
des
bourgeois
pointed
out
the
property
of
a
rich
iron
merchant
in
paris
who
he
said
had
just
died
the
place
is
for
sale
uncle
and
a
very
pretty
house
it
is
there
s
a
charming
garden
running
down
to
the
let
us
go
in
said
the
doctor
seeing
at
the
farther
end
of
a
small
paved
courtyard
a
house
standing
between
the
walls
of
the
two
neighbouring
houses
which
were
masked
by
clumps
of
trees
and
it
is
built
over
a
cellar
said
the
doctor
going
up
the
steps
of
a
high
portico
adorned
with
vases
of
blue
and
white
pottery
in
which
geraniums
were
growing
cut
in
two
like
the
majority
of
provincial
houses
by
a
long
passage
which
led
from
the
courtyard
to
the
garden
the
house
had
only
one
room
to
the
right
a
salon
lighted
by
four
windows
two
on
the
courtyard
and
two
on
the
garden
but
had
used
one
of
these
windows
to
make
an
entrance
to
a
long
greenhouse
built
of
brick
which
extended
from
the
salon
towards
the
river
ending
in
a
horrible
chinese
pagoda
good
by
building
a
roof
to
that
greenhouse
and
laying
a
floor
said
old
minoret
i
could
put
my
book
there
and
make
a
very
comfortable
study
of
that
extraordinary
bit
of
architecture
at
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
toward
the
garden
was
the
decorated
in
imitation
of
black
lacquer
with
green
and
gold
flowers
this
was
separated
from
the
kitchen
by
the
well
of
the
staircase
communication
with
the
kitchen
was
had
through
a
little
pantry
built
behind
the
staircase
the
kitchen
itself
looking
into
the
courtyard
through
windows
with
iron
railings
there
were
two
chambers
on
the
next
floor
and
above
them
attic
rooms
sheathed
in
wood
which
were
fairly
habitable
after
examining
the
house
rapidly
and
observing
that
it
was
covered
with
trellises
from
top
to
bottom
on
the
side
of
the
courtyard
as
well
as
on
that
to
the
garden
which
ended
in
a
terrace
overlooking
the
river
and
adorned
with
pottery
vases
the
doctor
remarked
must
have
spend
a
good
deal
of
money
ho
i
should
think
so
answered
he
liked
flowers
nonsense
what
do
they
bring
in
says
my
wife
you
saw
inside
there
how
an
artist
came
from
paris
to
paint
flowers
in
fresco
in
the
corridor
he
put
those
enormous
mirrors
everywhere
the
ceilings
were
all
with
cornices
which
cost
six
francs
a
foot
the
floor
is
in
marquetry
perfect
folly
the
house
won
t
sell
for
a
penny
the
well
nephew
buy
it
for
me
let
me
know
what
you
do
about
it
here
s
my
address
the
rest
i
leave
to
my
notary
who
lives
opposite
he
asked
as
they
left
the
house
emigres
answered
the
post
master
named
the
house
once
bought
the
illustrious
doctor
instead
of
living
there
wrote
to
his
nephew
to
let
it
the
was
therefore
occupied
by
the
notary
of
nemours
who
about
that
time
sold
his
practice
to
dionis
his
and
died
two
years
later
leaving
the
house
on
the
doctor
s
hands
just
at
the
time
when
the
fate
of
napoleon
was
being
decided
in
the
neighbourhood
the
doctor
s
heirs
at
first
misled
had
by
this
time
decided
that
his
thought
of
returning
to
his
native
place
was
merely
a
rich
man
s
fancy
and
that
probably
he
had
some
tie
in
paris
which
would
keep
him
there
and
cheat
them
of
their
inheritance
however
s
wife
seized
the
occasion
to
write
him
a
letter
the
old
man
replied
that
as
soon
as
peace
was
signed
the
roads
cleared
of
soldiers
and
safe
communications
established
he
meant
to
go
and
live
at
nemours
he
did
in
fact
put
in
an
appearance
with
two
of
his
clients
the
architect
of
his
hospital
and
an
upholsterer
who
took
charge
of
the
repairs
the
indoor
arrangements
and
the
transportation
of
the
furniture
madame
proposed
the
cook
of
the
late
notary
as
caretaker
and
the
woman
was
accepted
when
the
heirs
heard
that
their
uncle
and
minoret
was
really
coming
to
live
in
nemours
they
were
seized
in
spite
of
the
political
events
which
were
just
then
weighing
so
heavily
on
brie
and
on
the
gatinais
with
a
devouring
curiosity
which
was
not
surprising
was
he
rich
economical
or
spendthrift
would
he
leave
a
fine
fortune
or
nothing
was
his
property
in
annuities
in
the
end
they
found
out
what
follows
but
only
by
taking
infinite
pains
and
employing
much
subterraneous
spying
after
the
death
of
his
wife
ursula
mirouet
and
between
the
years
and
the
doctor
who
had
been
appointed
consulting
physician
to
the
emperor
in
must
have
made
a
good
deal
of
money
but
no
one
knew
how
much
he
lived
simply
without
other
extravagancies
than
a
carriage
by
the
year
and
a
sumptuous
apartment
he
received
no
guests
and
dined
out
almost
every
day
his
housekeeper
furious
at
not
being
allowed
to
go
with
him
to
nemours
told
zelie
levrault
the
post
master
s
wife
that
she
knew
the
doctor
had
fourteen
thousand
francs
a
year
on
the
now
after
twenty
years
exercise
of
a
profession
which
his
position
as
head
of
a
hospital
physician
to
the
emperor
and
member
of
the
institute
rendered
lucrative
these
fourteen
thousand
francs
a
year
showed
only
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
francs
laid
by
to
have
saved
only
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
the
doctor
must
have
had
either
many
vices
or
many
virtues
to
gratify
but
neither
his
housekeeper
nor
zelie
nor
any
one
else
could
discover
the
reason
for
such
moderate
means
minoret
who
when
he
left
it
was
much
regretted
in
the
quarter
of
paris
where
he
had
lived
was
one
of
the
most
benevolent
of
men
and
like
larrey
kept
his
kind
deeds
a
profound
secret
the
heirs
watched
the
arrival
of
their
uncle
s
fine
furniture
and
large
library
with
complacency
and
looked
forward
to
his
own
coming
he
being
now
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
lately
appointed
by
the
king
a
chevalier
of
the
order
of
perhaps
on
account
of
his
retirement
which
left
a
vacancy
for
some
favorite
but
when
the
architect
and
painter
and
upholsterer
had
arranged
everything
in
the
most
comfortable
manner
the
doctor
did
not
come
madame
who
kept
an
eye
on
the
upholsterer
and
architect
as
if
her
own
property
was
concerned
found
out
through
the
indiscretion
of
a
young
man
sent
to
arrange
the
books
that
the
doctor
was
taking
care
of
a
little
orphan
named
ursula
the
news
flew
like
through
the
town
at
last
however
towards
the
middle
of
the
month
of
january
the
old
man
actually
arrived
installing
himself
quietly
almost
slyly
with
a
little
girl
about
ten
months
old
and
a
nurse
the
child
can
t
be
his
daughter
said
the
terrified
heirs
he
is
years
whoever
she
is
remarked
madame
massin
she
ll
give
us
plenty
of
tintouin
a
word
peculiar
to
nemours
meaning
uneasiness
anxiety
or
more
literally
tingling
in
the
ears
the
doctor
received
his
on
the
mother
s
side
somewhat
coldly
her
husband
had
just
bought
the
place
of
clerk
of
the
court
and
the
pair
began
at
once
to
tell
him
of
their
difficulties
neither
massin
nor
his
wife
were
rich
massin
s
father
a
locksmith
at
montargis
had
been
obliged
to
compromise
with
his
creditors
and
was
now
at
years
of
age
working
like
a
young
man
and
had
nothing
to
leave
behind
him
madame
massin
s
father
had
just
died
at
montereau
after
the
battle
in
despair
at
seeing
his
farm
burned
his
fields
ruined
his
cattle
slaughtered
we
ll
get
nothing
out
of
your
said
massin
to
his
wife
now
pregnant
with
her
second
child
after
the
interview
the
doctor
however
gave
them
privately
ten
thousand
francs
with
which
massin
who
was
a
great
friend
of
the
notary
and
of
the
sheriff
began
the
business
of
and
carried
matters
so
briskly
with
the
peasantry
that
by
the
time
of
which
we
are
now
writing
goupil
knew
him
to
hold
at
least
eighty
thousand
francs
on
their
property
as
to
his
other
niece
the
doctor
obtained
for
her
husband
through
his
influence
in
paris
the
collectorship
of
nemours
and
became
his
bondsman
though
needed
no
assistance
zelie
his
wife
being
jealous
of
the
uncle
s
liberality
to
his
two
nieces
took
her
old
son
to
see
him
and
talked
of
the
expense
he
would
be
to
them
at
a
school
in
paris
where
she
said
education
costs
so
much
the
doctor
obtained
a
for
his
at
the
school
of
where
desire
was
put
into
the
fourth
class
cremiere
massin
and
extremely
common
persons
were
rated
without
appeal
by
the
doctor
within
two
months
of
his
arrival
in
nemours
during
which
time
they
courted
less
their
uncle
than
his
property
persons
who
are
led
by
instinct
have
one
great
disadvantage
against
others
with
ideas
they
are
quickly
found
out
the
suggestions
of
instinct
are
too
natural
too
open
to
the
eye
not
to
be
seen
at
a
glance
whereas
the
conceptions
of
the
mind
require
an
equal
amount
of
intellect
to
discover
them
after
buying
the
gratitude
of
his
heirs
and
thus
as
it
were
shutting
their
mouths
the
wily
doctor
made
a
pretext
of
his
occupations
his
habits
and
the
care
of
the
little
ursula
to
avoid
receiving
his
relatives
without
exactly
closing
his
doors
to
them
he
liked
to
dine
alone
he
went
to
bed
late
and
he
got
up
late
he
had
returned
to
his
native
place
for
the
very
purpose
of
finding
rest
in
solitude
these
whims
of
an
old
man
seemed
to
be
natural
and
his
relatives
contented
themselves
with
paying
him
weekly
visits
on
sundays
from
one
to
four
o
clock
to
which
however
he
tried
to
put
a
stop
by
saying
don
t
come
and
see
me
unless
you
want
the
doctor
while
not
refusing
to
be
called
in
consultation
over
serious
cases
especially
if
the
patients
were
indigent
would
not
serve
as
a
physician
in
the
little
hospital
of
nemours
and
declared
that
he
no
longer
practiced
his
profession
i
ve
killed
enough
people
he
said
laughing
to
the
abbe
chaperon
who
knowing
his
benevolence
would
often
get
him
to
attend
the
poor
he
s
an
original
these
words
said
of
doctor
minoret
were
the
harmless
revenge
of
various
wounded
vanities
for
a
doctor
collects
about
him
a
society
of
persons
who
have
many
of
the
characteristics
of
a
set
of
heirs
those
of
the
bourgeoisie
who
thought
themselves
entitled
to
visit
this
distinguished
physician
kept
up
a
ferment
of
jealousy
against
the
few
privileged
friends
whom
he
did
admit
to
his
intimacy
which
had
in
the
long
run
some
unfortunate
results
chapter
iii
the
doctor
s
friends
curiously
enough
though
it
explains
the
old
proverb
that
extremes
meet
the
materialistic
doctor
and
the
cure
of
nemours
were
soon
friends
the
old
man
loved
backgammon
a
favorite
game
of
the
priesthood
and
the
abbe
chaperon
played
it
with
about
as
much
skill
as
he
himself
the
game
was
the
first
tie
between
them
then
minoret
was
charitable
and
the
abbe
was
the
fenelon
of
the
gatinais
both
had
had
a
wide
and
varied
education
the
man
of
god
was
the
only
person
in
all
nemours
who
was
fully
capable
of
understanding
the
atheist
to
be
able
to
argue
men
must
first
understand
each
other
what
pleasure
is
there
in
saying
sharp
words
to
one
who
can
t
feel
them
the
doctor
and
the
priest
had
far
too
much
taste
and
had
seen
too
much
of
good
society
not
to
practice
its
precepts
they
were
thus
for
the
little
warfare
so
essential
to
conversation
they
hated
each
other
s
opinions
but
they
valued
each
other
s
character
if
such
conflicts
and
such
sympathies
are
not
true
elements
of
intimacy
we
must
surely
despair
of
society
which
especially
in
france
requires
some
form
of
antagonism
it
is
from
the
shock
of
characters
and
not
from
the
struggle
of
opinions
that
antipathies
are
generated
the
abbe
chaperon
became
therefore
the
doctor
s
chief
friend
this
excellent
ecclesiastic
then
sixty
years
of
age
had
been
curate
of
nemours
ever
since
the
of
catholic
worship
out
of
attachment
to
his
flock
he
had
refused
the
vicariat
of
the
diocese
if
those
who
were
indifferent
to
religion
thought
well
of
him
for
so
doing
the
faithful
loved
him
the
more
for
it
so
revered
by
his
sheep
respected
by
the
inhabitants
at
large
the
abbe
did
good
without
inquiring
into
the
religious
opinions
of
those
he
benefited
his
parsonage
with
scarcely
furniture
enough
for
the
common
needs
of
life
was
cold
and
shabby
like
the
lodging
of
a
miser
charity
and
avarice
manifest
themselves
in
the
same
way
charity
lays
up
a
treasure
in
heaven
which
avarice
lays
up
on
earth
the
abbe
chaperon
argued
with
his
servant
over
expenses
even
more
sharply
than
gobseck
with
his
if
indeed
that
famous
jew
kept
a
servant
at
all
the
good
priest
often
sold
the
buckles
off
his
shoes
and
his
breeches
to
give
their
value
to
some
poor
person
who
appealed
to
him
at
a
moment
when
he
had
not
a
penny
when
he
was
seen
coming
out
of
church
with
the
straps
of
his
breeches
tied
into
the
devout
women
would
redeem
the
buckles
from
the
and
jeweler
of
the
town
and
return
them
to
their
pastor
with
a
lecture
he
never
bought
himself
any
clothes
or
linen
and
wore
his
garments
till
they
scarcely
held
together
his
linen
thick
with
darns
rubbed
his
skin
like
a
hair
shirt
madame
de
portenduere
and
other
good
souls
had
an
agreement
with
his
housekeeper
to
replace
the
old
clothes
with
new
ones
after
he
went
to
sleep
and
the
abbe
did
not
always
find
out
the
difference
he
ate
his
food
off
pewter
with
iron
forks
and
spoons
when
he
received
his
assistants
and
on
days
of
high
solemnity
an
expense
obligatory
on
the
heads
of
parishes
he
borrowed
linen
and
silver
from
his
friend
the
atheist
my
silver
is
his
salvation
the
doctor
would
say
these
noble
deeds
always
accompanied
by
spiritual
encouragement
were
done
with
a
beautiful
naivete
such
a
life
was
all
the
more
meritorious
because
the
abbe
was
possessed
of
an
erudition
that
was
vast
and
varied
and
of
great
and
precious
faculties
delicacy
and
grace
the
inseparable
accompaniments
of
simplicity
lent
charm
to
an
elocution
that
was
worthy
of
a
prelate
his
manners
his
character
and
his
habits
gave
to
his
intercourse
with
others
the
most
exquisite
savor
of
all
that
is
most
spiritual
most
sincere
in
the
human
mind
a
lover
of
gayety
he
was
never
priest
in
a
salon
until
doctor
minoret
s
arrival
the
good
man
kept
his
light
under
a
bushel
without
regret
owning
a
rather
fine
library
and
an
income
of
two
thousand
francs
when
he
came
to
nemours
he
now
possessed
in
nothing
at
all
except
his
stipend
as
parish
priest
nearly
the
whole
of
which
he
gave
away
during
the
year
the
giver
of
excellent
counsel
in
delicate
matters
or
in
great
misfortunes
many
persons
who
never
went
to
church
to
obtain
consolation
went
to
the
parsonage
to
get
advice
one
little
anecdote
will
suffice
to
complete
his
portrait
sometimes
the
peasants
rarely
it
is
true
but
occasionally
unprincipled
men
would
tell
him
they
were
sued
for
debt
or
would
get
themselves
threatened
fictitiously
to
stimulate
the
abbe
s
benevolence
they
would
even
deceive
their
wives
who
believing
their
chattels
were
threatened
with
an
execution
and
their
cows
seized
deceived
in
their
turn
the
poor
priest
with
their
innocent
tears
he
would
then
manage
with
great
difficulty
to
provide
the
seven
or
eight
hundred
francs
demanded
of
him
with
which
the
peasant
bought
himself
a
morsel
of
land
when
pious
persons
and
vestrymen
denounced
the
fraud
begging
the
abbe
to
consult
them
in
future
before
lending
himself
to
such
cupidity
he
would
say
but
suppose
they
had
done
something
wrong
to
obtain
their
bit
of
land
isn
t
it
doing
good
when
we
prevent
evil
some
persons
may
wish
for
a
sketch
of
this
figure
remarkable
for
the
fact
that
science
and
literature
had
filled
the
heart
and
passed
through
the
strong
head
without
corrupting
either
at
sixty
years
of
age
the
abbe
s
hair
was
white
as
snow
so
keenly
did
he
feel
the
sorrows
of
others
and
so
heavily
had
the
events
of
the
revolution
weighed
upon
him
twice
incarcerated
for
refusing
to
take
the
oath
he
had
twice
as
he
used
to
say
uttered
in
in
he
was
of
medium
height
neither
stout
nor
thin
his
face
much
wrinkled
and
hollowed
and
quite
colorless
attracted
immediate
attention
by
the
absolute
tranquillity
expressed
in
its
shape
and
by
the
purity
of
its
outline
which
seemed
to
be
edged
with
light
the
face
of
a
chaste
man
has
an
unspeakable
radiance
brown
eyes
with
lively
pupils
brightened
the
irregular
features
which
were
surmounted
by
a
broad
forehead
his
glance
wielded
a
power
which
came
of
a
gentleness
that
was
not
devoid
of
strength
the
arches
of
his
brow
formed
caverns
shaded
by
huge
gray
eyebrows
which
alarmed
no
one
as
most
of
his
teeth
were
gone
his
mouth
had
lost
its
shape
and
his
cheeks
had
fallen
in
but
this
physical
destruction
was
not
without
charm
even
the
wrinkles
full
of
pleasantness
seemed
to
smile
on
others
without
being
gouty
his
feet
were
tender
and
he
walked
with
so
much
difficulty
that
he
wore
shoes
made
of
calf
s
skin
all
the
year
round
he
thought
the
fashion
of
trousers
unsuitable
for
priests
and
he
always
appeared
in
stockings
of
coarse
black
yarn
knit
by
his
housekeeper
and
cloth
breeches
he
never
went
out
in
his
cassock
but
wore
a
brown
overcoat
and
still
retained
the
hat
he
had
worn
so
courageously
in
times
of
danger
this
noble
and
beautiful
old
man
whose
face
was
glorified
by
the
serenity
of
a
soul
above
reproach
will
be
found
to
have
so
great
an
influence
upon
the
men
and
things
of
this
history
that
it
was
proper
to
show
the
sources
of
his
authority
and
power
minoret
took
three
newspapers
one
liberal
one
ministerial
one
ultra
a
few
periodicals
and
certain
scientific
journals
the
accumulation
of
which
swelled
his
library
the
newspapers
encyclopaedias
and
books
were
an
attraction
to
a
retired
captain
of
the
regiment
named
monsieur
de
jordy
a
voltairean
nobleman
and
an
old
bachelor
who
lived
on
sixteen
hundred
francs
of
pension
and
annuity
combined
having
read
the
gazettes
for
several
days
by
favor
of
the
abbe
monsieur
de
jordy
thought
it
proper
to
call
and
thank
the
doctor
in
person
at
this
first
visit
the
old
captain
formerly
a
professor
at
the
military
academy
won
the
doctor
s
heart
who
returned
the
call
with
alacrity
monsieur
de
jordy
a
spare
little
man
much
troubled
by
his
blood
though
his
face
was
very
pale
attracted
attention
by
the
resemblance
of
his
handsome
brow
to
that
of
charles
xii
above
it
he
kept
his
hair
cropped
short
like
that
of
the
his
blue
eyes
seemed
to
say
that
love
had
passed
that
way
so
mournful
were
they
revealing
memories
about
which
he
kept
such
utter
silence
that
his
old
friends
never
detected
even
an
allusion
to
his
past
life
nor
a
single
exclamation
drawn
forth
by
similarity
of
circumstances
he
hid
the
painful
mystery
of
his
past
beneath
a
philosophic
gayety
but
when
he
thought
himself
alone
his
motions
stiffened
by
a
slowness
which
was
more
a
matter
of
choice
than
the
result
of
old
age
betrayed
the
constant
presence
of
distressful
thoughts
the
abbe
chaperon
called
him
a
christian
ignorant
of
his
christianity
dressed
always
in
blue
cloth
his
rather
rigid
demeanor
and
his
clothes
bespoke
the
old
habits
of
military
discipline
his
sweet
and
harmonious
voice
stirred
the
soul
his
beautiful
hands
and
the
general
cut
of
his
figure
recalling
that
of
the
comte
d
artois
showed
how
charming
he
must
have
been
in
his
youth
and
made
the
mystery
of
his
life
still
more
mysterious
an
observer
asked
involuntarily
what
misfortune
had
blighted
such
beauty
courage
grace
accomplishment
and
all
the
precious
qualities
of
the
heart
once
united
in
his
person
monsieur
de
jordy
shuddered
if
robespierre
s
name
were
uttered
before
him
he
took
much
snuff
but
strange
to
say
he
gave
up
the
habit
to
please
little
ursula
who
at
first
showed
a
dislike
to
him
on
that
account
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
little
girl
the
captain
fastened
his
eyes
upon
her
with
a
look
that
was
almost
passionate
he
loved
her
play
so
extravagantly
and
took
such
interest
in
all
she
did
that
the
tie
between
himself
and
the
doctor
grew
closer
every
day
though
the
latter
never
dared
to
say
to
him
you
too
have
you
lost
children
there
are
beings
kind
and
patient
as
old
jordy
who
pass
through
life
with
a
bitter
thought
in
their
heart
and
a
tender
but
sorrowful
smile
on
their
lips
carrying
with
them
to
the
grave
the
secret
of
their
lives
letting
no
one
guess
it
through
pride
through
disdain
possibly
through
revenge
confiding
in
none
but
god
without
other
consolation
than
his
monsieur
de
jordy
like
the
doctor
had
come
to
die
in
nemours
but
he
knew
no
one
except
the
abbe
who
was
always
at
the
beck
and
call
of
his
parishioners
and
madame
de
portenduere
who
went
to
bed
at
nine
o
clock
so
much
against
his
will
he
too
had
taken
to
going
to
bed
early
in
spite
of
the
thorns
that
beset
his
pillow
it
was
therefore
a
great
piece
of
good
fortune
for
him
as
well
as
for
the
doctor
when
he
encountered
a
man
who
had
known
the
same
world
and
spoken
the
same
language
as
himself
with
whom
he
could
exchange
ideas
and
who
went
to
bed
late
after
monsieur
de
jordy
the
abbe
chaperon
and
minoret
had
passed
one
evening
together
they
found
so
much
pleasure
in
it
that
the
priest
and
soldier
returned
every
night
regularly
at
nine
o
clock
the
hour
at
which
little
ursula
having
gone
to
bed
the
doctor
was
free
all
three
would
then
sit
up
till
midnight
or
one
o
clock
after
a
time
this
trio
became
a
quartette
another
man
to
whom
life
was
known
and
who
owed
to
his
practical
training
as
a
lawyer
the
indulgence
knowledge
observation
shrewdness
and
talent
for
conversation
which
the
soldier
doctor
and
priest
owed
to
their
practical
dealings
with
the
souls
diseases
and
education
of
men
was
added
to
the
number
monsieur
bongrand
the
justice
of
peace
heard
of
the
pleasure
of
these
evenings
and
sought
admittance
to
the
doctor
s
society
before
becoming
justice
of
peace
at
nemours
he
had
been
for
ten
years
a
solicitor
at
melun
where
he
conducted
his
own
cases
according
to
the
custom
of
small
towns
where
there
are
no
barristers
he
became
a
widower
at
years
of
age
but
felt
himself
still
too
active
to
lead
an
idle
life
he
therefore
sought
and
obtained
the
position
of
justice
of
peace
at
nemours
which
became
vacant
a
few
months
before
the
arrival
of
doctor
minoret
monsieur
bongrand
lived
modestly
on
his
salary
of
fifteen
hundred
francs
in
order
that
he
might
devote
his
private
income
to
his
son
who
was
studying
law
in
paris
under
the
famous
derville
he
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
retired
chief
of
a
civil
service
office
he
had
the
peculiar
face
of
a
bureaucrat
less
sallow
than
pallid
on
which
public
business
vexations
and
disgust
leave
their
imprint
a
face
lined
by
thought
and
also
by
the
continual
restraints
familiar
to
those
who
are
trained
not
to
speak
their
minds
freely
it
was
often
illumined
by
smiles
characteristic
of
men
who
alternately
believe
all
and
believe
nothing
who
are
accustomed
to
see
and
hear
all
without
being
startled
and
to
fathom
the
abysses
which
hollows
in
the
depths
of
the
human
heart
below
the
hair
which
was
less
white
than
discolored
and
worn
flattened
to
the
head
was
a
fine
sagacious
forehead
the
yellow
tones
of
which
harmonized
well
with
the
scanty
tufts
of
thin
hair
his
face
with
the
features
set
close
together
bore
some
likeness
to
that
of
a
fox
all
the
more
because
his
nose
was
short
and
pointed
in
speaking
he
spluttered
at
the
mouth
which
was
broad
like
that
of
most
great
talkers
a
habit
which
led
goupil
to
say
an
umbrella
would
be
useful
when
listening
to
him
or
the
justice
rains
his
eyes
looked
keen
behind
his
spectacles
but
if
he
took
the
glasses
off
his
dulled
glance
seemed
almost
vacant
though
he
was
naturally
gay
even
jovial
he
was
apt
to
give
himself
too
important
and
pompous
an
air
he
usually
kept
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
and
only
took
them
out
to
settle
his
on
his
nose
with
a
movement
that
was
half
comic
and
which
announced
the
coming
of
a
keen
observation
or
some
victorious
argument
his
gestures
his
loquacity
his
innocent
proclaimed
the
provincial
lawyer
these
slight
defects
were
however
superficial
he
redeemed
them
by
an
exquisite
which
a
rigid
moralist
might
call
the
indulgence
natural
to
superiority
he
looked
a
little
like
a
fox
and
he
was
thought
to
be
very
wily
but
never
false
or
dishonest
his
wiliness
was
perspicacity
and
consisted
in
foreseeing
results
and
protecting
himself
and
others
from
the
traps
set
for
them
he
loved
whist
a
game
known
to
the
captain
and
the
doctor
and
which
the
abbe
learned
to
play
in
a
very
short
time
this
little
circle
of
friends
made
for
itself
an
oasis
in
mironet
s
salon
the
doctor
of
nemours
who
was
not
without
education
and
knowledge
of
the
world
and
who
greatly
respected
minoret
as
an
honor
to
the
profession
came
there
sometimes
but
his
duties
and
also
his
fatigue
which
obliged
him
to
go
to
bed
early
and
to
be
up
early
prevented
his
being
as
assiduously
present
as
the
three
other
friends
this
intercourse
of
five
superior
men
the
only
ones
in
nemours
who
had
sufficiently
wide
knowledge
to
understand
each
other
explains
old
minoret
s
aversion
to
his
relatives
if
he
were
compelled
to
leave
them
his
money
at
least
he
need
not
admit
them
to
his
society
whether
the
post
master
the
sheriff
and
the
collector
understood
this
distinction
or
whether
they
were
reassured
by
the
evident
loyalty
and
benefactions
of
their
uncle
certain
it
is
that
they
ceased
to
his
great
satisfaction
to
see
much
of
him
so
about
eight
months
after
the
arrival
of
the
doctor
these
four
players
of
whist
and
backgammon
made
a
solid
and
exclusive
little
world
which
was
to
each
a
fraternal
aftermath
an
unlooked
for
fine
season
the
gentle
pleasures
of
which
were
the
more
enjoyed
this
little
circle
of
choice
spirits
closed
round
ursula
a
child
whom
each
adopted
according
to
his
individual
tendencies
the
abbe
thought
of
her
soul
the
judge
imagined
himself
her
guardian
the
soldier
intended
to
be
her
teacher
and
as
for
minoret
he
was
father
mother
and
physician
all
in
one
after
he
became
acclimated
old
minoret
settled
into
certain
habits
of
life
under
fixed
rules
after
the
manner
of
the
provinces
on
ursula
s
account
he
received
no
visitors
in
the
morning
and
never
gave
dinners
but
his
friends
were
at
liberty
to
come
to
his
house
at
six
o
clock
and
stay
till
midnight
the
found
the
newspapers
on
the
table
and
read
them
while
awaiting
the
rest
or
they
sometimes
sallied
forth
to
meet
the
doctor
if
he
were
out
for
a
walk
this
tranquil
life
was
not
a
mere
necessity
of
old
age
it
was
the
wise
and
careful
scheme
of
a
man
of
the
world
to
keep
his
happiness
untroubled
by
the
curiosity
of
his
heirs
and
the
gossip
of
a
little
town
he
yielded
nothing
to
that
capricious
goddess
public
opinion
whose
tyranny
one
of
the
present
great
evils
of
france
was
just
beginning
to
establish
its
power
and
to
make
the
whole
nation
a
mere
province
so
as
soon
as
the
child
was
weaned
and
could
walk
alone
the
doctor
sent
away
the
housekeeper
whom
his
niece
madame
had
chosen
for
him
having
discovered
that
she
told
her
patroness
everything
that
happened
in
his
household
ursula
s
nurse
the
widow
of
a
poor
workman
who
possessed
no
name
but
a
baptismal
one
and
who
came
from
bougival
had
lost
her
last
child
aged
six
months
just
as
the
doctor
who
knew
her
to
be
a
good
and
honest
creature
engaged
her
as
wetnurse
for
ursula
antoinette
patris
her
maiden
name
widow
of
pierre
called
le
bougival
attached
herself
naturally
to
ursula
as
wetmaids
do
to
their
nurslings
this
blind
maternal
affection
was
accompanied
in
this
instance
by
household
devotion
told
of
the
doctor
s
intention
to
send
away
his
housekeeper
la
bougival
secretly
learned
to
cook
became
neat
and
handy
and
discovered
the
old
man
s
ways
she
took
the
utmost
care
of
the
house
and
furniture
in
short
she
was
indefatigable
not
only
did
the
doctor
wish
to
keep
his
private
life
within
four
walls
as
the
saying
is
but
he
also
had
certain
reasons
for
hiding
a
knowledge
of
his
business
affairs
from
his
relatives
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
after
his
arrival
la
bougival
was
the
only
servant
in
the
house
on
her
discretion
he
knew
he
could
count
and
he
disguised
his
real
purposes
by
the
open
reason
of
a
necessary
economy
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
his
heirs
he
became
a
miser
without
fawning
or
wheedling
solely
by
the
influence
of
her
devotion
and
solicitude
la
bougival
who
was
years
old
at
the
time
this
tale
begins
was
the
housekeeper
of
the
doctor
and
his
protegee
the
pivot
on
which
the
whole
house
turned
in
short
the
confidential
servant
she
was
called
la
bougival
from
the
admitted
impossibility
of
applying
to
her
person
the
name
that
actually
belonged
to
her
antoinette
for
names
and
forms
do
obey
the
laws
of
harmony
the
doctor
s
miserliness
was
not
mere
talk
it
was
real
and
it
had
an
object
from
the
year
he
cut
off
two
of
his
newspapers
and
ceased
subscribing
to
periodicals
his
annual
expenses
which
all
nemours
could
estimate
did
not
exceed
eighteen
hundred
francs
a
year
like
most
old
men
his
wants
in
linen
boots
and
clothing
were
very
few
every
six
months
he
went
to
paris
no
doubt
to
draw
and
reinvest
his
income
in
fifteen
years
he
never
said
a
single
word
to
any
one
in
relation
to
his
affairs
his
confidence
in
bongrand
was
of
slow
growth
it
was
not
until
after
the
revolution
of
that
he
told
him
of
his
projects
nothing
further
was
known
of
the
doctor
s
life
either
by
the
bourgeoisie
at
large
or
by
his
heirs
as
for
his
political
opinions
he
did
not
meddle
in
public
matters
seeing
that
he
paid
less
than
a
hundred
francs
a
year
in
taxes
and
refused
impartially
to
subscribe
to
either
royalist
or
liberal
demands
his
known
horror
for
the
priesthood
and
his
deism
were
so
little
obtrusive
that
he
turned
out
of
his
house
a
commercial
runner
sent
by
his
desire
to
ask
a
subscription
to
the
cure
meslier
and
the
discours
du
general
such
tolerance
seemed
inexplicable
to
the
liberals
of
nemours
the
doctor
s
three
collateral
heirs
and
his
wife
monsieur
and
madame
junior
monsieur
and
madame
whom
we
shall
in
future
call
simply
cremiere
massin
and
minoret
because
these
distinctions
among
homonyms
is
quite
unnecessary
out
of
the
gatinais
met
together
as
people
do
in
little
towns
the
post
master
gave
a
grand
dinner
on
his
son
s
birthday
a
ball
during
the
carnival
another
on
the
anniversary
of
his
marriage
to
all
of
which
he
invited
the
whole
bourgeoisie
of
nemours
the
collector
received
his
relations
and
friends
twice
a
year
the
clerk
of
the
court
too
poor
he
said
to
fling
himself
into
such
extravagance
lived
in
a
small
way
in
a
house
standing
down
the
grand
rue
the
of
which
was
let
to
his
sister
the
of
nemours
a
situation
she
owed
to
the
doctor
s
kind
offices
nevertheless
in
the
course
of
the
year
these
three
families
did
meet
together
frequently
in
the
houses
of
friends
in
the
public
promenades
at
the
market
on
their
doorsteps
or
of
a
sunday
in
the
square
as
on
this
occasion
so
that
one
way
and
another
they
met
nearly
every
day
for
the
last
three
years
the
doctor
s
age
his
economies
and
his
probable
wealth
had
led
to
allusions
or
frank
remarks
among
the
townspeople
as
to
the
disposition
of
his
property
a
topic
which
made
the
doctor
and
his
heirs
of
deep
interest
to
the
little
town
for
the
last
six
months
not
a
day
passed
that
friends
and
neighbours
did
not
speak
to
the
heirs
with
secret
envy
of
the
day
the
good
man
s
eyes
would
shut
and
the
coffers
open
doctor
minoret
may
be
an
able
physician
on
good
terms
with
death
but
none
but
god
is
eternal
said
one
pooh
he
ll
bury
us
all
his
health
is
better
than
ours
replied
an
heir
hypocritically
well
if
you
don
t
get
the
money
yourselves
your
children
will
unless
that
little
ursula
he
won
t
leave
it
all
to
ursula
as
madame
massin
had
predicted
was
the
bete
noire
of
the
relations
their
sword
of
damocles
and
madame
cremiere
s
favorite
saying
well
whoever
lives
will
know
shows
that
they
wished
at
any
rate
more
harm
to
her
than
good
the
collector
and
the
clerk
of
the
court
poor
in
comparison
with
the
post
master
had
often
estimated
by
way
of
conversation
the
doctor
s
property
if
they
met
their
uncle
walking
on
the
banks
of
the
canal
or
along
the
road
they
would
look
at
each
other
piteously
he
must
have
got
hold
of
some
elixir
of
life
said
one
he
has
made
a
bargain
with
the
devil
replied
the
other
he
ought
to
give
us
the
bulk
of
it
that
fat
minoret
doesn
t
need
anything
said
massin
ah
but
minoret
has
a
son
who
ll
waste
his
substance
answered
cremiere
how
much
do
you
really
think
the
doctor
has
at
the
end
of
twelve
years
say
twelve
thousand
francs
saved
each
year
that
would
give
one
hundred
and
thousand
francs
and
the
interest
brings
in
at
least
one
hundred
thousand
more
but
as
he
must
if
he
consults
a
notary
in
paris
have
made
some
good
strokes
of
business
and
we
know
that
up
to
he
could
get
seven
or
eight
per
cent
from
the
state
he
must
now
have
at
least
four
hundred
thousand
francs
without
counting
the
capital
of
his
fourteen
thousand
a
year
from
the
five
per
cents
if
he
were
to
die
without
leaving
anything
to
ursula
we
should
get
at
least
seven
or
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
besides
the
house
and
well
a
hundred
thousand
to
minoret
and
three
hundred
thousand
apiece
to
you
and
me
that
would
be
ha
that
would
make
us
comfortable
if
he
did
that
said
massin
i
should
sell
my
situation
in
court
and
buy
an
estate
i
d
try
to
be
judge
at
fontainebleau
and
get
myself
elected
as
for
me
i
should
buy
a
brokerage
business
said
the
collector
unluckily
that
girl
he
has
on
his
arm
and
the
abbe
have
got
round
him
i
don
t
believe
we
can
do
anything
with
still
we
know
very
well
he
will
never
leave
anything
to
the
chapter
iv
zelie
the
fright
of
the
heirs
at
beholding
their
uncle
on
his
way
to
mass
will
now
be
understood
the
dullest
persons
have
mind
enough
to
foresee
a
danger
to
constitutes
the
mind
of
the
peasant
as
well
as
that
of
the
diplomatist
and
on
that
ground
the
stupidest
of
men
is
sometimes
the
most
powerful
so
the
fatal
reasoning
if
that
little
ursula
has
influence
enough
to
drag
her
godfather
into
the
pale
of
the
church
she
will
certainly
have
enough
to
make
him
leave
her
his
property
was
now
stamped
in
letters
of
fire
on
the
brains
of
the
most
obtuse
heir
the
post
master
had
forgotten
about
his
son
in
his
hurry
to
reach
the
square
for
if
the
doctor
were
really
in
the
church
hearing
mass
it
was
a
question
of
losing
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
fears
of
these
relations
came
from
the
strongest
and
most
legitimate
of
social
feelings
family
interests
well
monsieur
minoret
said
the
mayor
formerly
a
miller
who
had
now
become
royalist
named
when
the
devil
gets
old
the
devil
a
monk
would
be
your
uncle
they
say
is
one
of
better
late
than
never
cousin
responded
the
post
master
trying
to
conceal
his
annoyance
how
that
fellow
will
grin
if
we
are
defrauded
he
is
capable
of
marrying
his
son
to
that
damned
girl
may
the
devil
get
her
cried
cremiere
shaking
his
fists
at
the
mayor
as
he
entered
the
porch
what
s
cremiere
grumbling
about
said
the
butcher
of
the
town
a
the
elder
isn
t
he
pleased
to
see
his
uncle
on
the
road
to
paradise
who
would
ever
have
believed
it
ejaculated
massin
ha
one
should
never
say
fountain
i
ll
not
drink
of
your
water
remarked
the
notary
who
seeing
the
group
from
afar
had
left
his
wife
to
go
to
church
without
him
come
monsieur
dionis
said
cremiere
taking
the
notary
by
the
arm
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
under
the
circumstances
i
advise
you
said
the
notary
addressing
the
heirs
collectively
to
go
to
bed
and
get
up
at
your
usual
hour
to
eat
your
soup
before
it
gets
cold
to
put
your
feet
in
your
shoes
and
your
hats
on
your
heads
in
short
to
continue
your
ways
of
life
precisely
as
if
nothing
had
you
are
not
consoling
said
massin
in
spite
of
his
squat
dumpy
figure
and
heavy
face
was
really
as
keen
as
a
blade
in
pursuit
of
usurious
fortune
he
did
business
secretly
with
massin
to
whom
he
no
doubt
pointed
out
such
peasants
as
were
hampered
in
means
and
such
pieces
of
land
as
could
be
bought
for
a
song
the
two
men
were
in
a
position
to
choose
their
opportunities
none
that
were
good
escaped
them
and
they
shared
the
profits
of
which
retards
though
it
does
not
prevent
the
acquirement
of
the
soil
by
the
peasantry
so
dionis
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
doctor
s
inheritance
not
so
much
for
the
post
master
and
the
collector
as
for
his
friend
the
clerk
of
the
court
sooner
or
later
massin
s
share
in
the
doctor
s
money
would
swell
the
capital
with
which
these
secret
associates
worked
the
canton
we
must
try
to
find
out
through
monsieur
bongrand
where
the
influence
comes
from
said
the
notary
in
a
low
voice
with
a
sign
to
massin
to
keep
quiet
what
are
you
about
minoret
cried
a
little
woman
suddenly
descending
upon
the
group
in
the
middle
of
which
stood
the
post
master
as
tall
and
round
as
a
tower
you
don
t
know
where
desire
is
and
there
you
are
planted
on
your
two
legs
gossiping
about
nothing
when
i
thought
you
on
horseback
oh
good
morning
messieurs
and
this
little
woman
thin
pale
and
fair
dressed
in
a
gown
of
white
cotton
with
pattern
of
large
flowers
a
cap
trimmed
with
ribbon
and
frilled
with
lace
and
wearing
a
small
green
shawl
on
her
flat
shoulders
was
minoret
s
wife
the
terror
of
postilions
servants
and
carters
who
kept
the
accounts
and
managed
the
establishment
with
finger
and
eye
as
they
say
in
those
parts
like
the
true
housekeeper
that
she
was
she
wore
no
ornaments
she
did
not
give
in
to
use
her
own
expression
to
and
trumpery
she
held
to
the
solid
and
the
substantial
and
wore
even
on
sundays
a
black
apron
in
the
pocket
of
which
she
jingled
her
household
keys
her
screeching
voice
was
agony
to
the
drums
of
all
ears
her
rigid
glance
conflicting
with
the
soft
blue
of
her
eyes
was
in
visible
harmony
with
the
thin
lips
of
a
pinched
mouth
and
a
high
projecting
and
very
imperious
forehead
sharp
was
the
glance
sharper
still
both
gesture
and
speech
zelie
being
obliged
to
have
a
will
for
two
had
it
for
three
said
goupil
who
pointed
out
the
successive
reigns
of
three
young
postilions
of
neat
appearance
who
had
been
set
up
in
life
by
zelie
each
after
seven
years
service
the
malicious
clerk
named
them
postilion
postilion
postilion
iii
but
the
little
influence
these
young
men
had
in
the
establishment
and
their
perfect
obedience
proved
that
zelie
was
merely
interested
in
worthy
helpers
this
attempt
at
scandal
was
against
probabilities
since
the
birth
of
her
son
nursed
by
her
without
any
evidence
of
how
it
was
possible
for
her
to
do
so
madame
minoret
had
thought
only
of
increasing
the
family
fortune
and
was
wholly
given
up
to
the
management
of
their
immense
establishment
to
steal
a
bale
of
hay
or
a
bushel
of
oats
or
get
the
better
of
zelie
in
even
the
most
complicated
accounts
was
a
thing
impossible
though
she
scribbled
hardly
better
than
a
cat
and
knew
nothing
of
arithmetic
but
addition
and
subtraction
she
never
took
a
walk
except
to
look
at
the
hay
the
oats
or
the
second
crops
she
sent
her
man
to
the
mowing
and
the
postilions
to
tie
the
bales
telling
them
the
quantity
within
a
hundred
pounds
each
field
should
bear
though
she
was
the
soul
of
that
great
body
called
and
led
him
about
by
his
pug
nose
she
was
made
to
feel
the
fears
which
occasionally
we
are
told
assail
all
tamers
of
wild
beasts
she
therefore
made
it
a
rule
to
get
into
a
rage
before
he
did
the
postilions
knew
very
well
when
his
wife
had
been
quarreling
with
him
for
his
anger
ricocheted
on
them
madame
minoret
was
as
clever
as
she
was
grasping
and
it
was
a
favorite
remark
in
the
whole
town
where
would
be
without
his
wife
when
you
know
what
has
happened
replied
the
post
master
you
ll
be
over
the
traces
what
is
it
ursula
has
taken
the
doctor
to
zelie
s
pupils
dilated
she
stood
for
a
moment
yellow
with
anger
then
crying
out
i
ll
see
it
before
i
believe
it
she
rushed
into
the
church
the
service
had
reached
the
elevation
the
stillness
of
the
worshippers
enabled
her
to
look
along
each
row
of
chairs
and
benches
as
she
went
up
the
aisle
beside
the
chapels
to
ursula
s
place
where
she
saw
old
minoret
standing
with
bared
head
if
you
recall
the
heads
of
boissy
d
anglas
morellet
helvetius
or
frederick
the
great
you
will
see
the
exact
image
of
doctor
minoret
whose
green
old
age
resembled
that
of
those
celebrated
personages
their
heads
coined
in
the
same
mint
for
each
had
the
characteristics
of
a
medal
showed
a
stern
and
profile
cold
tones
a
mathematical
brain
a
certain
narrowness
about
the
features
shrewd
eyes
grave
lips
and
a
something
that
was
surely
aristocratic
less
perhaps
in
sentiment
than
in
habit
more
in
the
ideas
than
in
the
character
all
men
of
this
stamp
have
high
brows
retreating
at
the
summit
the
sign
of
a
tendency
to
materialism
you
will
find
these
leading
characteristics
of
the
head
and
these
points
of
the
face
in
all
the
encyclopedists
in
the
orators
of
the
gironde
in
the
men
of
a
period
when
religious
ideas
were
almost
dead
men
who
called
themselves
deists
and
were
atheists
the
deist
is
an
atheist
lucky
in
classification
minoret
had
a
forehead
of
this
description
furrowed
with
wrinkles
which
recovered
in
his
old
age
a
sort
of
artless
candor
from
the
manner
in
which
the
silvery
hair
brushed
back
like
that
of
a
woman
when
making
her
toilet
curled
in
light
flakes
upon
the
blackness
of
his
coat
he
persisted
in
dressing
as
in
his
youth
in
black
silk
stockings
shoes
with
gold
buckles
breeches
of
black
and
a
black
coat
adorned
with
the
red
rosette
this
head
so
firmly
characterized
the
cold
whiteness
of
which
was
softened
by
the
yellowing
tones
of
old
age
happened
to
be
just
then
in
the
full
light
of
a
window
as
madame
minoret
came
in
sight
of
him
the
doctor
s
blue
eyes
with
their
reddened
lids
were
raised
to
heaven
a
new
conviction
had
given
them
a
new
expression
his
spectacles
lay
in
his
and
marked
the
place
where
he
had
ceased
to
pray
the
tall
and
spare
old
man
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
stood
erect
in
an
attitude
which
bespoke
the
full
strength
of
his
faculties
and
the
unshakable
assurance
of
his
faith
he
gazed
at
the
altar
humbly
with
a
look
of
renewed
hope
and
took
no
notice
of
his
nephew
s
wife
who
planted
herself
almost
in
front
of
him
as
if
to
reproach
him
for
coming
back
to
god
zelie
seeing
all
eyes
turned
upon
her
made
haste
to
leave
the
church
and
returned
to
the
square
less
hurriedly
than
she
had
left
it
she
had
reckoned
on
the
doctor
s
money
and
possession
was
becoming
problematical
she
found
the
clerk
of
the
court
the
collector
and
their
wives
in
greater
consternation
than
ever
goupil
was
taking
pleasure
in
tormenting
them
it
is
not
in
the
public
square
and
before
the
whole
town
that
we
ought
to
talk
of
our
affairs
said
zelie
come
home
with
me
you
too
monsieur
dionis
she
added
to
the
notary
you
ll
not
be
in
the
thus
the
probable
disinheritance
of
massin
cremiere
and
the
post
master
was
the
news
of
the
day
just
as
the
heirs
and
the
notary
were
crossing
the
square
to
go
to
the
post
house
the
noise
of
the
diligence
rattling
up
to
the
office
which
was
only
a
few
steps
from
the
church
at
the
top
of
the
grand
rue
made
its
usual
racket
goodness
i
m
like
you
minoret
i
forgot
all
about
desire
said
zelie
let
us
go
and
see
him
get
down
he
is
almost
a
lawyer
and
his
interests
are
mixed
up
in
this
the
arrival
of
the
diligence
is
always
an
amusement
but
when
it
comes
in
late
some
unusual
event
is
expected
the
crowd
now
moved
towards
the
here
s
desire
was
the
general
cry
the
tyrant
and
yet
the
life
and
soul
of
nemours
desire
always
put
the
town
in
a
ferment
when
he
came
loved
by
the
young
men
with
whom
he
was
invariably
generous
he
stimulated
them
by
his
very
presence
but
his
methods
of
amusement
were
so
dreaded
by
older
persons
that
more
than
one
family
was
very
thankful
to
have
him
complete
his
studies
and
study
law
in
paris
desire
minoret
a
slight
youth
slender
and
fair
like
his
mother
from
whom
he
obtained
his
blue
eyes
and
pale
skin
smiled
from
the
window
on
the
crowd
and
jumped
lightly
down
to
kiss
his
mother
a
short
sketch
of
the
young
fellow
will
show
how
proud
zelie
felt
when
she
saw
him
he
wore
very
elegant
boots
trousers
of
white
english
drilling
held
under
his
feet
by
straps
of
varnished
leather
a
rich
cravat
admirably
put
on
and
still
more
admirably
fastened
a
pretty
fancy
waistcoat
in
the
pocket
of
said
waistcoat
a
flat
watch
the
chain
of
which
hung
down
and
finally
a
short
of
blue
cloth
and
a
gray
hat
but
his
lack
of
the
was
shown
in
the
gilt
buttons
of
the
waistcoat
and
the
ring
worn
outside
of
his
purple
kid
glove
he
carried
a
cane
with
a
chased
gold
head
you
are
losing
your
watch
said
his
mother
kissing
him
no
it
is
worn
that
way
he
replied
letting
his
father
hug
him
well
cousin
so
we
shall
soon
see
you
a
lawyer
said
massin
i
shall
take
the
oaths
at
the
beginning
of
next
term
said
desire
returning
the
friendly
nods
he
was
receiving
on
all
sides
now
we
shall
have
some
fun
said
goupil
shaking
him
by
the
hand
ha
my
old
wag
so
here
you
are
replied
desire
you
take
your
law
license
for
all
license
said
goupil
affronted
by
being
treated
so
cavalierly
in
presence
of
others
you
know
my
luggage
cried
desire
to
the
old
conductor
of
the
diligence
have
it
taken
to
the
the
sweat
is
rolling
off
your
horses
said
zelie
sharply
to
the
conductor
you
haven
t
to
drive
them
in
that
way
you
are
stupider
than
your
own
but
monsieur
desire
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
here
to
save
you
from
anxiety
explained
cabirolle
but
if
there
was
no
accident
why
risk
killing
the
horses
she
retorted
the
greetings
of
friends
and
acquaintances
the
crowding
of
the
young
men
around
desire
and
the
relating
of
the
incidents
of
the
journey
took
enough
time
for
the
mass
to
be
concluded
and
the
worshippers
to
issue
from
the
church
by
mere
chance
which
manages
many
things
desire
saw
ursula
on
the
porch
as
he
passed
along
and
he
stopped
short
amazed
at
her
beauty
his
action
also
stopped
the
advance
of
the
relations
who
accompanied
him
in
giving
her
arm
to
her
godfather
ursula
was
obliged
to
hold
her
in
one
hand
and
her
parasol
in
the
other
and
this
she
did
with
the
innate
grace
which
graceful
women
put
into
the
awkward
or
difficult
things
of
their
charming
craft
of
womanhood
if
mind
does
truly
reveal
itself
in
all
things
we
may
be
permitted
to
say
that
ursula
s
attitude
and
bearing
suggested
divine
simplicity
she
was
dressed
in
a
white
cambric
gown
made
like
a
wrapper
trimmed
here
and
there
with
knots
of
blue
ribbon
the
pelerine
edged
with
the
same
ribbon
run
through
a
broad
hem
and
tied
with
bows
like
those
on
the
dress
showed
the
great
beauty
of
her
shape
her
throat
of
a
pure
white
was
charming
in
tone
against
the
blue
the
right
color
for
a
fair
skin
a
long
blue
sash
with
floating
ends
defined
a
slender
waist
which
seemed
flexible
a
most
seductive
charm
in
women
she
wore
a
bonnet
modestly
trimmed
with
ribbons
like
those
of
the
gown
the
strings
of
which
were
tied
under
her
chin
setting
off
the
whiteness
of
the
straw
and
doing
no
despite
to
that
of
her
beautiful
complexion
ursula
dressed
her
own
hair
naturally
a
la
berthe
as
it
was
then
called
in
heavy
braids
of
fine
fair
hair
laid
flat
on
either
side
of
the
head
each
little
strand
reflecting
the
light
as
she
walked
her
gray
eyes
soft
and
proud
at
the
same
time
were
in
harmony
with
a
finely
modeled
brow
a
rosy
tinge
suffusing
her
cheeks
like
a
cloud
brightened
a
face
which
was
regular
without
being
insipid
for
nature
had
given
her
by
some
rare
privilege
extreme
purity
of
form
combined
with
strength
of
countenance
the
nobility
of
her
life
was
manifest
in
the
general
expression
of
her
person
which
might
have
served
as
a
model
for
a
type
of
trustfulness
or
of
modesty
her
health
though
brilliant
was
not
coarsely
apparent
in
fact
her
whole
air
was
distinguished
beneath
the
little
gloves
of
a
light
color
it
was
easy
to
imagine
her
pretty
hands
the
arched
and
slender
feet
were
delicately
shod
in
bronzed
kid
boots
trimmed
with
a
brown
silk
fringe
her
blue
sash
holding
at
the
waist
a
small
flat
watch
and
a
blue
purse
with
gilt
tassels
attracted
the
eyes
of
every
woman
she
met
he
has
given
her
a
new
watch
said
madame
cremiere
pinching
her
husband
s
arm
heavens
is
that
ursula
cried
desire
i
didn
t
recognize
well
my
dear
uncle
said
the
post
master
addressing
the
doctor
and
pointing
to
the
whole
population
drawn
up
in
parallel
hedges
to
let
the
doctor
pass
everybody
wants
to
see
was
it
the
abbe
chaperon
or
mademoiselle
ursula
who
converted
you
uncle
said
massin
bowing
to
the
doctor
and
his
protegee
with
jesuitical
humility
ursula
replied
the
doctor
laconically
continuing
to
walk
on
as
if
annoyed
the
night
before
as
the
old
man
finished
his
game
of
whist
with
ursula
the
nemours
doctor
and
bongrand
he
remarked
i
intend
to
go
to
church
then
said
bongrand
your
heirs
won
t
get
another
night
s
the
speech
was
superfluous
however
for
a
single
glance
sufficed
the
sagacious
and
doctor
to
read
the
minds
of
his
heirs
by
the
expression
of
their
faces
zelie
s
irruption
into
the
church
her
glance
which
the
doctor
intercepted
this
meeting
of
all
the
expectant
ones
in
the
public
square
and
the
expression
in
their
eyes
as
they
turned
them
on
ursula
all
proved
to
him
their
hatred
now
freshly
awakened
and
their
sordid
fears
it
is
a
feather
in
your
cap
mademoiselle
said
madame
cremiere
putting
in
her
word
with
a
humble
bow
a
miracle
which
will
not
cost
you
it
is
god
s
doing
madame
replied
ursula
god
exclaimed
my
used
to
say
he
served
to
blanket
many
your
had
the
mind
of
a
jockey
said
the
doctor
severely
come
said
minoret
to
his
wife
and
son
why
don
t
you
bow
to
my
uncle
i
shouldn
t
be
mistress
of
myself
before
that
little
hypocrite
cried
zelie
carrying
off
her
son
i
advise
you
uncle
not
to
go
to
mass
without
a
velvet
cap
said
madame
massin
the
church
is
very
pooh
niece
said
the
doctor
looking
round
on
the
assembly
the
sooner
i
m
put
to
bed
the
sooner
you
ll
he
walked
on
quickly
drawing
ursula
with
him
and
seemed
in
such
a
hurry
that
the
others
dropped
behind
why
do
you
say
such
harsh
things
to
them
it
isn
t
right
said
ursula
shaking
his
arm
in
a
coaxing
way
i
shall
always
hate
hypocrites
as
much
after
as
before
i
became
religious
i
have
done
good
to
them
all
and
i
asked
no
gratitude
but
not
one
of
my
relatives
sent
you
a
flower
on
your
birthday
which
they
know
is
the
only
day
i
at
some
distance
behind
the
doctor
and
ursula
came
madame
de
portenduere
dragging
herself
along
as
if
overcome
with
trouble
she
belonged
to
the
class
of
old
women
whose
dress
recalls
the
style
of
the
last
century
they
wear
gowns
with
flat
sleeves
the
cut
of
which
can
be
seen
in
the
portraits
of
madame
lebrun
they
all
have
black
lace
mantles
and
bonnets
of
a
shape
gone
by
in
keeping
with
their
slow
and
dignified
deportment
one
might
almost
fancy
that
they
still
wore
paniers
under
their
petticoats
or
felt
them
there
as
persons
who
have
lost
a
leg
are
said
to
fancy
that
the
foot
is
moving
they
swathe
their
heads
in
old
lace
which
declines
to
drape
gracefully
about
their
cheeks
their
wan
and
elongated
faces
their
haggard
eyes
and
faded
brows
are
not
without
a
certain
melancholy
grace
in
spite
of
the
false
fronts
with
flattened
curls
to
which
they
cling
and
yet
these
ruins
are
all
subordinate
to
an
unspeakable
dignity
of
look
and
manner
the
red
and
wrinkled
eyes
of
this
old
lady
showed
plainly
that
she
had
been
crying
during
the
service
she
walked
like
a
person
in
trouble
seemed
to
be
expecting
some
one
and
looked
behind
her
from
time
to
time
now
the
fact
of
madame
de
portenduere
looking
behind
her
was
really
as
remarkable
in
its
way
as
the
conversion
of
doctor
minoret
who
can
madame
de
portenduere
be
looking
for
said
madame
massin
rejoining
the
other
heirs
who
were
for
the
moment
struck
dumb
by
the
doctor
s
answer
for
the
cure
said
dionis
the
notary
suddenly
striking
his
forehead
as
if
some
forgotten
thought
or
memory
had
occurred
to
him
i
have
an
idea
i
ll
save
your
inheritance
let
us
go
and
breakfast
gayly
with
madame
we
can
well
imagine
the
alacrity
with
which
the
heirs
followed
the
notary
to
the
post
house
goupil
who
accompanied
his
friend
desire
locked
arm
in
arm
with
him
whispered
something
in
the
youth
s
ear
with
an
odious
smile
what
do
i
care
answered
the
son
of
the
house
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
am
madly
in
love
with
florine
the
most
celestial
creature
in
the
florine
and
who
may
she
be
demanded
goupil
i
m
too
fond
of
you
to
let
you
make
a
goose
of
yourself
wish
such
florine
is
the
idol
of
the
famous
nathan
my
passion
is
wasted
i
know
that
she
has
positively
refused
to
marry
sometimes
those
girls
who
are
fools
with
their
bodies
are
wise
with
their
heads
responded
goupil
if
you
could
but
see
her
only
once
said
desire
lackadaisically
you
wouldn
t
say
such
if
i
saw
you
throwing
away
your
whole
future
for
nothing
better
than
a
fancy
said
goupil
with
a
warmth
which
might
even
have
deceived
his
master
i
would
break
your
doll
as
varney
served
amy
robsart
in
your
wife
must
be
a
d
aiglement
or
a
mademoiselle
du
rouvre
and
get
you
made
a
deputy
my
future
depends
on
yours
and
i
sha
n
t
let
you
commit
any
i
am
rich
enough
to
care
only
for
happiness
replied
desire
what
are
you
two
plotting
together
cried
zelie
beckoning
to
the
two
friends
who
were
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
to
come
into
the
house
the
doctor
disappeared
into
the
rue
des
bourgeois
with
the
activity
of
a
young
man
and
soon
reached
his
own
house
where
strange
events
had
lately
taken
place
the
visible
results
of
which
now
filled
the
minds
of
the
whole
community
of
nemours
a
few
explanations
are
needed
to
make
this
history
and
the
notary
s
remark
to
the
heirs
perfectly
intelligible
to
the
reader
chapter
ursula
the
of
doctor
minoret
the
famous
harpsichordist
and
maker
of
instruments
valentin
mirouet
also
one
of
our
most
celebrated
organists
died
in
leaving
a
natural
son
the
child
of
his
old
age
whom
he
acknowledged
and
called
by
his
own
name
but
who
turned
out
a
worthless
fellow
he
was
deprived
on
his
death
bed
of
the
comfort
of
seeing
this
petted
son
joseph
mirouet
a
singer
and
composer
having
made
his
debut
at
the
italian
opera
under
a
feigned
name
ran
away
with
a
young
lady
in
germany
the
dying
father
commended
the
young
man
who
was
really
full
of
talent
to
his
proving
to
him
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
refused
to
marry
the
mother
that
he
might
not
injure
madame
minoret
the
doctor
promised
to
give
the
unfortunate
joseph
half
of
whatever
his
wife
inherited
from
her
father
whose
business
was
purchased
by
the
erards
he
made
due
search
for
his
illegitimate
but
grimm
informed
him
one
day
that
after
enlisting
in
a
prussian
regiment
joseph
had
deserted
and
taken
a
false
name
and
that
all
efforts
to
find
him
would
be
frustrated
joseph
mirouet
gifted
by
nature
with
a
delightful
voice
a
fine
figure
a
handsome
face
and
being
moreover
a
composer
of
great
taste
and
much
brilliancy
led
for
over
fifteen
years
the
bohemian
life
which
hoffman
has
so
well
described
so
by
the
time
he
was
forty
he
was
reduced
to
such
depths
of
poverty
that
he
took
advantage
of
the
events
of
to
make
himself
once
more
a
frenchman
he
settled
in
hamburg
where
he
married
the
daughter
of
a
bourgeois
a
girl
devoted
to
music
who
fell
in
love
with
the
singer
whose
fame
was
ever
prospective
and
chose
to
devote
her
life
to
him
but
after
fifteen
years
of
bohemia
joseph
mirouet
was
unable
to
bear
prosperity
he
was
naturally
a
spendthrift
and
though
kind
to
his
wife
he
wasted
her
fortune
in
a
very
few
years
the
household
must
have
dragged
on
a
wretched
existence
before
joseph
mirouet
reached
the
point
of
enlisting
as
a
musician
in
a
french
regiment
in
the
of
the
regiment
by
the
merest
chance
heard
the
name
of
mirouet
was
struck
by
it
and
wrote
to
doctor
minoret
to
whom
he
was
under
obligations
the
answer
was
not
long
in
coming
as
a
result
in
before
the
allied
occupation
joseph
mirouet
had
a
home
in
paris
where
his
wife
died
giving
birth
to
a
little
girl
whom
the
doctor
desired
should
be
called
ursula
after
his
wife
the
father
did
not
long
survive
the
mother
worn
out
as
she
was
by
hardship
and
poverty
when
dying
the
unfortunate
musician
bequeathed
his
daughter
to
the
doctor
who
was
already
her
godfather
in
spite
of
his
repugnance
for
what
he
called
the
mummeries
of
the
church
having
seen
his
own
children
die
in
succession
either
in
dangerous
confinements
or
during
the
first
year
of
their
lives
the
doctor
had
awaited
with
anxiety
the
result
of
a
last
hope
when
a
nervous
delicate
and
sickly
woman
begins
with
a
miscarriage
it
is
not
unusual
to
see
her
go
through
a
series
of
such
pregnancies
as
ursula
minoret
did
in
spite
of
the
care
and
watchfulness
and
science
of
her
husband
the
poor
man
often
blamed
himself
for
their
mutual
persistence
in
desiring
children
the
last
child
born
after
a
rest
of
nearly
two
years
died
in
a
victim
of
its
mother
s
nervous
condition
if
we
listen
to
physiologists
who
tell
us
that
in
the
inexplicable
phenomenon
of
generation
the
child
derives
from
the
father
by
blood
and
from
the
mother
in
its
nervous
system
compelled
to
renounce
the
joys
of
a
feeling
all
powerful
within
him
the
doctor
turned
to
benevolence
as
a
substitute
for
his
denied
paternity
during
his
married
life
thus
cruelly
disappointed
he
had
longed
more
especially
for
a
fair
little
daughter
a
flower
to
bring
joy
to
the
house
he
therefore
gladly
accepted
joseph
mirouet
s
legacy
and
gave
to
the
orphan
all
the
hopes
of
his
vanished
dreams
for
two
years
he
took
part
as
cato
for
pompey
in
the
most
minute
particulars
of
ursula
s
life
he
would
not
allow
the
nurse
to
suckle
her
or
to
take
her
up
or
put
her
to
bed
without
him
his
medical
science
and
his
experience
were
all
put
to
use
in
her
service
after
going
through
many
trials
alternations
of
hope
and
fear
and
the
joys
and
labors
of
a
mother
he
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
this
child
of
the
fair
german
woman
and
the
french
singer
a
creature
of
vigorous
health
and
profound
sensibility
with
all
the
eager
feelings
of
a
mother
the
happy
old
man
watched
the
growth
of
the
pretty
hair
first
down
then
silk
at
last
hair
fine
and
soft
and
clinging
to
the
fingers
that
caressed
it
he
often
kissed
the
little
naked
feet
the
toes
of
which
covered
with
a
pellicle
through
which
the
blood
was
seen
were
like
rosebuds
he
was
passionately
fond
of
the
child
when
she
tried
to
speak
or
when
she
fixed
her
beautiful
blue
eyes
upon
some
object
with
that
serious
reflective
look
which
seems
the
dawn
of
thought
and
which
she
ended
with
a
laugh
he
would
stay
by
her
side
for
hours
seeking
with
jordy
s
help
to
understand
the
reasons
which
most
people
call
caprices
underlying
the
phenomena
of
this
delicious
phase
of
life
when
childhood
is
both
flower
and
fruit
a
confused
intelligence
a
perpetual
movement
a
powerful
desire
ursula
s
beauty
and
gentleness
made
her
so
dear
to
the
doctor
that
he
would
have
liked
to
change
the
laws
of
nature
in
her
behalf
he
declared
to
old
jordy
that
his
teeth
ached
when
ursula
was
cutting
hers
when
old
men
love
children
there
is
no
limit
to
their
passion
they
worship
them
for
these
little
beings
they
silence
their
own
manias
or
recall
a
whole
past
in
their
service
experience
patience
sympathy
the
acquisitions
of
life
treasures
laboriously
amassed
all
are
spent
upon
that
young
life
in
which
they
live
again
their
intelligence
does
actually
take
the
place
of
motherhood
their
wisdom
ever
on
the
alert
is
equal
to
the
intuition
of
a
mother
they
remember
the
delicate
perceptions
which
in
their
own
mother
were
divinations
and
import
them
into
the
exercise
of
a
compassion
which
is
carried
to
an
extreme
in
their
minds
by
a
sense
of
the
child
s
unutterable
weakness
the
slowness
of
their
movements
takes
the
place
of
maternal
gentleness
in
them
as
in
children
life
is
reduced
to
its
simplest
expression
if
maternal
sentiment
makes
the
mother
a
slave
the
abandonment
of
self
allows
an
old
man
to
devote
himself
utterly
for
these
reasons
it
is
not
unusual
to
see
children
in
close
intimacy
with
old
persons
the
old
soldier
the
old
abbe
the
old
doctor
happy
in
the
kisses
and
cajoleries
of
little
ursula
were
never
weary
of
answering
her
talk
and
playing
with
her
far
from
making
them
impatient
her
petulances
charmed
them
and
they
gratified
all
her
wishes
making
each
the
ground
of
some
little
training
the
child
grew
up
surrounded
by
old
men
who
smiled
at
her
and
made
themselves
mothers
for
her
sake
all
three
equally
attentive
and
provident
thanks
to
this
wise
education
ursula
s
soul
developed
in
a
sphere
that
suited
it
this
rare
plant
found
its
special
soil
it
breathed
the
elements
of
its
true
life
and
assimilated
the
sun
rays
that
belonged
to
it
in
what
faith
do
you
intend
to
bring
up
the
little
one
asked
the
abbe
of
the
doctor
when
ursula
was
six
years
old
in
yours
answered
minoret
an
atheist
after
the
manner
of
monsieur
wolmar
in
the
nouvelle
heloise
he
did
not
claim
the
right
to
deprive
ursula
of
the
benefits
offered
by
the
catholic
religion
the
doctor
sitting
at
the
moment
on
a
bench
outside
the
chinese
pagoda
felt
the
pressure
of
the
abbe
s
hand
on
his
yes
abbe
every
time
she
talks
to
me
of
god
i
shall
send
her
to
her
friend
shapron
he
said
imitating
ursula
s
infant
speech
i
wish
to
see
whether
religious
sentiment
is
inborn
or
not
therefore
i
shall
do
nothing
either
for
or
against
the
tendencies
of
that
young
soul
but
in
my
heart
i
have
appointed
you
her
spiritual
god
will
reward
you
i
hope
replied
the
abbe
gently
joining
his
hands
and
raising
them
towards
heaven
as
if
he
were
making
a
brief
mental
prayer
so
from
the
time
she
was
six
years
old
the
little
orphan
lived
under
the
religious
influence
of
the
abbe
just
as
she
had
already
come
under
the
educational
training
of
her
friend
jordy
the
captain
formerly
a
professor
in
a
military
academy
having
a
taste
for
grammar
and
for
the
differences
among
european
languages
had
studied
the
problem
of
a
universal
tongue
this
learned
man
patient
as
most
old
scholars
are
delighted
in
teaching
ursula
to
read
and
write
he
taught
her
also
the
french
language
and
all
she
needed
to
know
of
arithmetic
the
doctor
s
library
afforded
a
choice
of
books
which
could
be
read
by
a
child
for
amusement
as
well
as
instruction
the
abbe
and
the
soldier
allowed
the
young
mind
to
enrich
itself
with
the
freedom
and
comfort
which
the
doctor
gave
to
the
body
ursula
learned
as
she
played
religion
was
given
with
due
reflection
left
to
follow
the
divine
training
of
a
nature
that
was
led
into
regions
of
purity
by
these
judicious
educators
ursula
inclined
more
to
sentiment
than
to
duty
she
took
as
her
rule
of
conduct
the
voice
of
her
own
conscience
rather
than
the
demands
of
social
law
in
her
nobility
of
feeling
and
action
would
ever
be
spontaneous
her
judgment
would
confirm
the
impulse
of
her
heart
she
was
destined
to
do
right
as
a
pleasure
before
doing
it
as
an
obligation
this
distinction
is
the
peculiar
sign
of
christian
education
these
principles
altogether
different
from
those
that
are
taught
to
men
were
suitable
for
a
woman
the
spirit
and
the
conscience
of
the
home
the
beautifier
of
domestic
life
the
queen
of
her
household
all
three
of
these
old
preceptors
followed
the
same
method
with
ursula
instead
of
recoiling
before
the
bold
questions
of
innocence
they
explained
to
her
the
reasons
of
things
and
the
best
means
of
action
taking
care
to
give
her
none
but
correct
ideas
when
apropos
of
a
flower
a
star
a
blade
of
grass
her
thoughts
went
straight
to
god
the
doctor
and
the
professor
told
her
that
the
priest
alone
could
answer
her
none
of
them
intruded
on
the
territory
of
the
others
the
doctor
took
charge
of
her
material
and
the
things
of
life
jordy
s
department
was
instruction
moral
and
spiritual
questions
and
the
ideas
appertaining
to
the
higher
life
belonged
to
the
abbe
this
noble
education
was
not
as
it
often
is
counteracted
by
injudicious
servants
la
bougival
having
been
lectured
on
the
subject
and
being
moreover
too
simple
in
mind
and
character
to
interfere
did
nothing
to
injure
the
work
of
these
great
minds
ursula
a
privileged
being
grew
up
with
good
geniuses
round
her
and
her
naturally
fine
disposition
made
the
task
of
each
a
sweet
and
easy
one
such
manly
tenderness
such
gravity
lighted
by
smiles
such
liberty
without
danger
such
perpetual
care
of
soul
and
body
made
little
ursula
when
nine
years
of
age
a
child
and
delightful
to
behold
unhappily
this
paternal
trinity
was
broken
up
the
old
captain
died
the
following
year
leaving
the
abbe
and
the
doctor
to
finish
his
work
of
which
however
he
had
accomplished
the
most
difficult
part
flowers
will
bloom
of
themselves
if
grown
in
a
soil
thus
prepared
the
old
gentleman
had
laid
by
for
ten
years
past
one
thousand
francs
a
year
that
he
might
leave
ten
thousand
to
his
little
ursula
and
keep
a
place
in
her
memory
during
her
whole
life
in
his
will
the
wording
of
which
was
very
touching
he
begged
his
legatee
to
spend
the
four
or
five
hundred
francs
that
came
of
her
little
capital
exclusively
on
her
dress
when
the
justice
of
the
peace
applied
the
seals
to
the
effects
of
his
old
friend
they
found
in
a
small
room
which
the
captain
had
allowed
no
one
to
enter
a
quantity
of
toys
many
of
them
broken
while
all
had
been
used
toys
of
a
past
generation
reverently
preserved
which
monsieur
bongrand
was
according
to
the
captain
s
last
wishes
to
burn
with
his
own
hands
about
this
time
it
was
that
ursula
made
her
first
communion
the
abbe
employed
one
whole
year
in
duly
instructing
the
young
girl
whose
mind
and
heart
each
well
developed
yet
judiciously
balancing
one
another
needed
a
special
spiritual
nourishment
the
initiation
into
a
knowledge
of
divine
things
which
he
gave
her
was
such
that
ursula
grew
into
the
pious
and
mystical
young
girl
whose
character
rose
above
all
vicissitudes
and
whose
heart
was
enabled
to
conquer
adversity
then
began
a
secret
struggle
between
the
old
man
wedded
to
unbelief
and
the
young
girl
full
of
faith
long
unsuspected
by
her
who
incited
it
the
result
of
which
had
now
stirred
the
whole
town
and
was
destined
to
have
great
influence
on
ursula
s
future
by
rousing
against
her
the
antagonism
of
the
doctor
s
heirs
during
the
first
six
months
of
the
year
ursula
spent
all
her
mornings
at
the
parsonage
the
old
doctor
guessed
the
abbe
s
secret
hope
he
meant
to
make
ursula
an
unanswerable
argument
against
him
the
old
unbeliever
loved
by
his
godchild
as
though
she
were
his
own
daughter
would
surely
believe
in
such
artless
candor
he
could
not
fail
to
be
persuaded
by
the
beautiful
effects
of
religion
on
the
soul
of
a
child
where
love
was
like
those
trees
of
eastern
climes
bearing
both
flowers
and
fruit
always
fragrant
always
fertile
a
beautiful
life
is
more
powerful
than
the
strongest
argument
it
is
impossible
to
resist
the
charms
of
certain
sights
the
doctor
s
eyes
were
wet
he
knew
not
how
or
why
when
he
saw
the
child
of
his
heart
starting
for
the
church
wearing
a
frock
of
white
crape
and
shoes
of
white
satin
her
hair
bound
with
a
fillet
fastened
at
the
side
with
a
knot
of
white
ribbon
and
rippling
upon
her
shoulders
her
eyes
lighted
by
the
star
of
a
first
hope
hurrying
tall
and
beautiful
to
a
first
union
and
loving
her
godfather
better
since
her
soul
had
risen
towards
god
when
the
doctor
perceived
that
the
thought
of
immortality
was
nourishing
that
spirit
until
then
within
the
confines
of
childhood
as
the
sun
gives
life
to
the
earth
without
knowing
why
he
felt
sorry
that
he
remained
at
home
alone
sitting
on
the
steps
of
his
portico
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
iron
railing
of
the
gate
through
which
the
child
had
disappeared
saying
as
she
left
him
why
won
t
you
come
godfather
how
can
i
be
happy
without
you
though
shaken
to
his
very
center
the
pride
of
the
encyclopedist
did
not
as
yet
give
way
he
walked
slowly
in
a
direction
from
which
he
could
see
the
procession
of
communicants
and
distinguish
his
little
ursula
brilliant
with
exaltation
beneath
her
veil
she
gave
him
an
inspired
look
which
knocked
in
the
stony
regions
of
his
heart
on
the
corner
closed
to
god
but
still
the
old
deist
held
firm
he
said
to
himself
mummeries
if
there
be
a
maker
of
worlds
imagine
the
organizer
of
infinitude
concerning
himself
with
such
trifles
he
laughed
as
he
continued
his
walk
along
the
heights
which
look
down
upon
the
road
to
the
gatinais
where
the
bells
were
ringing
a
joyous
peal
that
told
of
the
joy
of
families
the
noise
of
backgammon
is
intolerable
to
persons
who
do
not
know
the
game
which
is
really
one
of
the
most
difficult
that
was
ever
invented
not
to
annoy
his
godchild
the
extreme
delicacy
of
whose
organs
and
nerves
could
not
bear
he
thought
without
injury
the
noise
and
the
exclamations
she
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
abbe
old
jordy
while
living
and
the
doctor
always
waited
till
their
child
was
in
bed
before
they
began
their
favorite
game
sometimes
the
visitors
came
early
when
she
was
out
for
a
walk
and
the
game
would
be
going
on
when
she
returned
then
she
resigned
herself
with
infinite
grace
and
took
her
seat
at
the
window
with
her
work
she
had
a
repugnance
to
the
game
which
is
really
in
the
beginning
very
hard
and
unconquerable
to
some
minds
so
that
unless
it
be
learned
in
youth
it
is
almost
impossible
to
take
it
up
in
after
life
the
night
of
her
first
communion
when
ursula
came
into
the
salon
where
her
godfather
was
sitting
alone
she
put
the
before
him
whose
throw
shall
it
be
she
asked
ursula
said
the
doctor
isn
t
it
a
sin
to
make
fun
of
your
godfather
the
day
of
your
first
communion
i
am
not
making
fun
of
you
she
said
sitting
down
i
want
to
give
you
some
pleasure
you
who
are
always
on
the
for
mine
when
monsieur
chaperon
was
pleased
with
me
he
gave
me
a
lesson
in
backgammon
and
he
has
given
me
so
many
that
now
i
am
quite
strong
enough
to
beat
you
you
shall
not
deprive
yourself
any
longer
for
me
i
have
conquered
all
difficulties
and
now
i
like
the
noise
of
the
ursula
won
the
abbe
had
slipped
in
to
enjoy
his
triumph
the
next
day
minoret
who
had
always
refused
to
let
ursula
learn
music
sent
to
paris
for
a
piano
made
arrangements
at
fontainebleau
for
a
teacher
and
submitted
to
the
annoyance
that
her
constant
practicing
was
to
him
one
of
poor
jordy
s
predictions
was
fulfilled
the
girl
became
an
excellent
musician
the
doctor
proud
of
her
talent
had
lately
sent
to
paris
for
a
master
an
old
german
named
schmucke
a
distinguished
professor
who
came
once
a
week
the
doctor
willingly
paying
for
an
art
which
he
had
formerly
declared
to
be
useless
in
a
household
unbelievers
do
not
like
music
a
celestial
language
developed
by
catholicism
which
has
taken
the
names
of
the
seven
notes
from
one
of
the
church
hymns
every
note
being
the
first
syllable
of
the
seven
first
lines
in
the
hymn
to
saint
john
the
impression
produced
on
the
doctor
by
ursula
s
first
communion
though
keen
was
not
lasting
the
calm
and
sweet
contentment
which
prayer
and
the
exercise
of
resolution
produced
in
that
young
soul
had
not
their
due
influence
upon
him
having
no
reasons
for
remorse
or
repentance
himself
he
enjoyed
a
serene
peace
doing
his
own
benefactions
without
hope
of
a
celestial
harvest
he
thought
himself
on
a
nobler
plane
than
religious
men
whom
he
always
accused
for
making
as
he
called
it
terms
with
god
but
the
abbe
would
say
to
him
if
all
men
would
be
so
you
must
admit
that
society
would
be
regenerated
there
would
be
no
more
misery
to
be
benevolent
after
your
fashion
one
must
needs
be
a
great
philosopher
you
rise
to
your
principles
through
reason
you
are
a
social
exception
whereas
it
suffices
to
be
a
christian
to
make
us
benevolent
in
ours
with
you
it
is
an
effort
with
us
it
comes
in
other
words
abbe
i
think
and
you
feel
that
s
the
whole
of
however
at
twelve
years
of
age
ursula
whose
quickness
and
natural
feminine
perceptions
were
trained
by
her
superior
education
and
whose
intelligence
in
its
dawn
was
enlightened
by
a
religious
spirit
of
all
spirits
the
most
refined
came
to
understand
that
her
godfather
did
not
believe
in
a
future
life
nor
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
nor
in
providence
nor
in
god
pressed
with
questions
by
the
innocent
creature
the
doctor
was
unable
to
hide
the
fatal
secret
ursula
s
artless
consternation
made
him
smile
but
when
he
saw
her
depressed
and
sad
he
felt
how
deep
an
affection
her
sadness
revealed
absolute
devotion
has
a
horror
of
every
sort
of
disagreement
even
in
ideas
which
it
does
not
share
sometimes
the
doctor
accepted
his
darling
s
reasonings
as
he
would
her
kisses
said
as
they
were
in
the
sweetest
of
voices
with
the
purest
and
most
fervent
feeling
believers
and
unbelievers
speak
different
languages
and
can
not
understand
each
other
the
young
girl
pleading
god
s
cause
was
unreasonable
with
the
old
man
as
a
spoilt
child
sometimes
maltreats
its
mother
the
abbe
rebuked
her
gently
telling
her
that
god
had
power
to
humiliate
proud
spirits
ursula
replied
that
david
had
overcome
goliath
this
religious
difference
these
complaints
of
the
child
who
wished
to
drag
her
godfather
to
god
were
the
only
troubles
of
this
happy
life
so
peaceful
yet
so
full
and
wholly
withdrawn
from
the
inquisitive
eyes
of
the
little
town
ursula
grew
and
developed
and
became
in
time
the
modest
and
religiously
trained
young
woman
whom
desire
admired
as
she
left
the
church
the
cultivation
of
flowers
in
the
garden
her
music
the
pleasures
of
her
godfather
and
all
the
little
cares
she
was
able
to
give
him
for
she
had
eased
la
bougival
s
labors
by
doing
everything
for
him
these
things
filled
the
hours
the
days
the
months
of
her
calm
life
nevertheless
for
about
a
year
the
doctor
had
felt
uneasy
about
his
ursula
and
watched
her
health
with
the
utmost
care
sagacious
and
profoundly
practical
observer
that
he
was
he
thought
he
perceived
some
commotion
in
her
moral
being
he
watched
her
like
a
mother
but
seeing
no
one
about
her
who
was
worthy
of
inspiring
love
his
uneasiness
on
the
subject
at
length
passed
away
at
this
conjuncture
one
month
before
the
day
when
this
drama
begins
the
doctor
s
intellectual
life
was
invaded
by
one
of
those
events
which
plough
to
the
very
depths
of
a
man
s
convictions
and
turn
them
over
but
this
event
needs
a
succinct
narrative
of
certain
circumstances
in
his
medical
career
which
will
give
perhaps
fresh
interest
to
the
story
chapter

a
treatise
on
mesmerism
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
science
was
sundered
as
widely
by

as

from

to

france
was
stirred
to
its
center

solemn
conclave
was
opened

was
rendered

proscribed
in

charlatanism
his

his
conducting

and
his
theory
but
let
us
at
once
admit
that
the
german
unfortunately
compromised
his
splendid
discovery
by
enormous
pecuniary
claims
mesmer
was
defeated
by
the
doubtfulness
of
facts
by
universal
ignorance
of
the
part
played
in
nature
by
imponderable
fluids
then
unobserved
and
by
his
own
inability
to
study
on
all
sides
a
science
possessing
a
triple
front
magnetism
has
many
applications
in
mesmer
s
hands
it
was
in
its
relation
to
the
future
merely
what
cause
is
to
effect
but
if
the
discoverer
lacked
genius
it
is
a
sad
thing
both
for
france
and
for
human
reason
to
have
to
say
that
a
science
contemporaneous
with
civilization
cultivated
by
egypt
and
chaldea
by
greece
and
india
met
in
paris
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
fate
that
truth
in
the
person
of
galileo
found
in
the
sixteenth
and
that
magnetism
was
rejected
and
cast
out
by
the
combined
attacks
of
science
and
religion

for
their
own
positions
magnetism
the
favorite
science
of
jesus
christ
and
one
of
the
divine
powers
which
he
gave
to
his
disciples
was
no
better
apprehended
by
the
church
than
by
the
disciples
of
voltaire
locke
and
condillac
the
encyclopedists
and
the
clergy
were
equally
averse
to
the
old
human
power
which
they
took
to
be
new
the
miracles
of
the
convulsionaries
suppressed
by
the
church
and
smothered
by
the
indifference
of
scientific
men
in
spite
of
the
precious
writings
of
the
councilor
carre
de
montgeron
were
the
first
summons
to
make
experiments
with
those
human
fluids
which
give
power
to
employ
certain
inward
forces
to
neutralize
the
sufferings
caused
by
outward
agents

to
do
this
it
was
necessary
to
admit
the
existence
of

negative
terms

the

respectable
body

doctors
displayed
all
the
bitterness
of
religious
warfare
against
the
mesmerists

were
as
cruel
in
their
hatred
as
it
was
possible
to
be
in
those
days
of

same
source
were
now
undermining
many
scepticisms
and
leading
even
the
most
indifferent
minds
to
the
plane
of
experiments
minoret
buried
in
nemours
was
ignorant
of
this
movement
of
minds
strong
in
the
north
of
europe
but
still
weak
in
france
where
however
many
facts
called
marvelous
by
superficial
observers
were
happening
but
falling
alas
like
stones
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
in
the
vortex
of
parisian
excitements
at
the
bottom
of
the
present
year
the
doctor
s
tranquillity
was
shaken
by
the
following
letter
my
old
comrade
all
friendship
even
if
lost
has
rights
which
it
is
difficult
to
set
aside
i
know
that
you
are
still
living
and
i
remember
far
less
our
enmity
than
our
happy
days
in
that
old
hovel
of
at
a
time
when
i
expect
to
soon
leave
the
world
i
have
it
on
my
heart
to
prove
to
you
that
magnetism
is
about
to
become
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
sciences
if
indeed
all
science
is
not
i
can
overcome
your
incredulity
by
proof
perhaps
i
shall
owe
to
your
curiosity
the
happiness
of
taking
you
once
more
by
the
hand
as
in
the
days
before
mesmer
always
yours
bouvard
stung
like
a
lion
by
a
gadfly
the
old
scientist
rushed
to
paris
and
left
his
card
on
bouvard
who
lived
in
the
rue
ferou
near
bouvard
sent
a
card
to
his
hotel
on
which
was
written
nine
o
clock
rue
opposite
the
minoret
who
seemed
to
have
renewed
his
youth
could
not
sleep
he
went
to
see
some
of
his
friends
among
the
faculty
to
inquire
if
the
world
were
turned
upside
down
if
the
science
of
medicine
still
had
a
school
if
the
four
faculties
any
longer
existed
the
doctors
reassured
him
declaring
that
the
old
spirit
of
opposition
was
as
strong
as
ever
only
instead
of
persecuting
as
heretofore
the
academies
of
medicine
and
of
sciences
rang
with
laughter
as
they
classed
magnetic
facts
with
the
tricks
of
comus
and
comte
and
bosco
with
jugglery
and
prestidigitation
and
all
that
now
went
by
the
name
of
amusing
this
assurance
did
not
prevent
old
minoret
from
keeping
the
appointment
made
for
him
by
bouvard
after
an
enmity
of
years
the
two
antagonists
met
beneath
a
in
the
rue
frenchmen
have
too
many
distractions
of
mind
to
hate
each
other
long
in
paris
especially
politics
literature
and
science
render
life
so
vast
that
every
man
can
find
new
worlds
to
conquer
where
all
pretensions
may
live
at
ease
hatred
requires
too
many
forces
fully
armed
none
but
public
bodies
can
keep
alive
the
sentiment
robespierre
and
danton
would
have
fallen
into
each
other
s
arms
at
the
end
of
years
however
the
two
doctors
each
withheld
his
hand
and
did
not
offer
it
bouvard
spoke
first
you
seem
wonderfully
yes
i
am
and
you
said
minoret
feeling
that
the
ice
was
now
broken
as
you
does
magnetism
prevent
people
from
dying
asked
minoret
in
a
joking
tone
but
without
sharpness
no
but
it
almost
prevented
me
from
then
you
are
not
rich
exclaimed
minoret
pooh
said
bouvard
but
i
am
cried
the
other
it
is
not
your
money
but
your
convictions
that
i
want
come
replied
bouvard
oh
you
obstinate
fellow
said
minoret
the
mesmerist
led
his
sceptic
with
some
precaution
up
a
dingy
staircase
to
the
fourth
floor
at
this
particular
time
an
extraordinary
man
had
appeared
in
paris
endowed
by
faith
with
incalculable
power
and
controlling
magnetic
forces
in
all
their
applications
not
only
did
this
great
unknown
who
still
lives
heal
from
a
distance
the
worst
and
most
inveterate
diseases
suddenly
and
radically
as
the
savior
of
men
did
formerly
but
he
was
also
able
to
call
forth
instantaneously
the
most
remarkable
phenomena
of
somnambulism
and
conquer
the
most
rebellious
will
the
countenance
of
this
mysterious
being
who
claims
to
be
responsible
to
god
alone
and
to
communicate
like
swedenborg
with
angels
resembles
that
of
a
lion
concentrated
irresistible
energy
shines
in
it
his
features
singularly
contorted
have
a
terrible
and
even
blasting
aspect
his
voice
which
comes
from
the
depths
of
his
being
seems
charged
with
some
magnetic
fluid
it
penetrates
the
hearer
at
every
pore
disgusted
by
the
ingratitude
of
the
public
after
his
many
cures
he
has
now
returned
to
an
impenetrable
solitude
a
voluntary
nothingness
his
hand
which
has
restored
a
dying
daughter
to
her
mother
fathers
to
their
children
adored
mistresses
to
lovers
frenzied
with
love
cured
the
sick
given
over
by
physicians
soothed
the
sufferings
of
the
dying
when
life
became
impossible
wrung
psalms
of
thanksgiving
in
synagogues
temples
and
churches
from
the
lips
of
priests
recalled
to
the
one
god
by
the
same
miracle
that
sovereign
hand
a
sun
of
life
dazzling
the
closed
eyes
of
the
somnambulist
has
never
been
raised
again
even
to
save
the
of
a
kingdom
wrapped
in
the
memory
of
his
past
mercies
as
in
a
luminous
shroud
he
denies
himself
to
the
world
and
lives
for
heaven
but
at
the
dawn
of
his
reign
surprised
by
his
own
gift
this
man
whose
generosity
equaled
his
power
allowed
a
few
interested
persons
to
witness
his
miracles
the
fame
of
his
work
which
was
mighty
and
could
easily
be
revived
reached
bouvard
who
was
then
on
the
verge
of
the
grave
the
persecuted
mesmerist
was
at
last
enabled
to
witness
the
startling
phenomena
of
a
science
he
had
long
treasured
in
his
heart
the
sacrifices
of
the
old
man
touched
the
heart
of
the
mysterious
stranger
who
accorded
him
certain
privileges
as
bouvard
now
went
up
the
staircase
he
listened
to
the
twittings
of
his
old
antagonist
with
malicious
delight
answering
only
you
shall
see
you
shall
see
with
the
emphatic
little
nods
of
a
man
who
is
sure
of
his
facts
the
two
physicians
entered
a
suite
of
rooms
that
were
more
than
modest
bouvard
went
alone
into
a
bedroom
which
adjoined
the
salon
where
he
left
minoret
whose
distrust
was
instantly
awakened
but
bouvard
returned
at
once
and
took
him
into
the
bedroom
where
he
saw
the
mysterious
swedenborgian
and
also
a
woman
sitting
in
an
armchair
the
woman
did
not
rise
and
seemed
not
to
notice
the
entrance
of
the
two
old
men
what
no
tub
cried
minoret
smiling
nothing
but
the
power
of
god
answered
the
swedenborgian
gravely
he
seemed
to
minoret
to
be
about
fifty
years
of
age
the
three
men
sat
down
and
the
mysterious
stranger
talked
of
the
rain
and
the
coming
fine
weather
to
the
great
astonishment
of
minoret
who
thought
he
was
being
hoaxed
the
swedenborgian
soon
began
however
to
question
his
visitor
on
his
scientific
opinions
and
seemed
evidently
to
be
taking
time
to
examine
him
you
have
come
here
solely
from
curiosity
monsieur
he
said
at
last
it
is
not
my
habit
to
prostitute
a
power
which
according
to
my
conviction
emanates
from
god
if
i
made
a
frivolous
or
unworthy
use
of
it
it
would
be
taken
from
me
nevertheless
there
is
some
hope
monsieur
bouvard
tells
me
of
changing
the
opinions
of
one
who
has
opposed
us
of
enlightening
a
scientific
man
whose
mind
is
candid
i
have
therefore
determined
to
satisfy
you
that
woman
whom
you
see
there
he
continued
pointing
to
her
is
now
in
a
somnambulic
sleep
the
statements
and
manifestations
of
somnambulists
declare
that
this
state
is
a
delightful
other
life
during
which
the
inner
being
freed
from
the
trammels
laid
upon
the
exercise
of
our
faculties
by
the
visible
world
moves
in
a
world
which
we
mistakenly
term
invisible
sight
and
hearing
are
then
exercised
in
a
manner
far
more
perfect
than
any
we
know
of
here
possibly
without
the
help
of
the
organs
we
now
employ
which
are
the
scabbard
of
the
luminous
blades
called
sight
and
hearing
to
a
person
in
that
state
distance
and
material
obstacles
do
not
exist
or
they
can
be
traversed
by
a
life
within
us
for
which
our
body
is
a
mere
receptacle
a
necessary
shelter
a
casing
terms
fail
to
describe
effects
that
have
lately
been
rediscovered
for
the
words
imponderable
intangible
invisible
have
no
meaning
to
the
fluid
whose
action
is
demonstrated
by
magnetism
light
is
ponderable
by
its
heat
which
by
penetrating
bodies
increases
their
volume
and
certainly
electricity
is
only
too
tangible
we
have
condemned
things
themselves
instead
of
blaming
the
imperfection
of
our
she
sleeps
said
minoret
examining
the
woman
who
seemed
to
him
to
belong
to
an
inferior
class
her
body
is
for
the
time
being
in
abeyance
said
the
swedenborgian
ignorant
persons
suppose
that
condition
to
be
sleep
but
she
will
prove
to
you
that
there
is
a
spiritual
universe
and
that
the
mind
when
there
does
not
obey
the
laws
of
this
material
universe
i
will
send
her
wherever
you
wish
to
go
a
hundred
miles
from
here
or
to
china
as
you
will
she
will
tell
you
what
is
happening
send
her
to
my
house
in
nemours
rue
des
bourgeois
that
will
do
said
minoret
he
took
minoret
s
hand
which
the
doctor
let
him
take
and
held
it
for
a
moment
seeming
to
collect
himself
then
with
his
other
hand
he
took
that
of
the
woman
sitting
in
the
and
placed
the
hand
of
the
doctor
in
it
making
a
sign
to
the
old
sceptic
to
seat
himself
beside
this
oracle
without
a
tripod
minoret
observed
a
slight
tremor
on
the
absolutely
calm
features
of
the
woman
when
their
hands
were
thus
united
by
the
swedenborgian
but
the
action
though
marvelous
in
its
effects
was
very
simply
done
obey
him
said
the
unknown
personage
extending
his
hand
above
the
head
of
the
sleeping
woman
who
seemed
to
imbibe
both
light
and
life
from
him
and
remember
that
what
you
do
for
him
will
please
you
can
now
speak
to
her
he
added
addressing
minoret
go
to
nemours
to
my
house
rue
des
bourgeois
said
the
doctor
give
her
time
put
your
hand
in
hers
until
she
proves
to
you
by
what
she
tells
you
that
she
is
where
you
wish
her
to
be
said
bouvard
to
his
old
friend
i
see
a
river
said
the
woman
in
a
feeble
voice
seeming
to
look
within
herself
with
deep
attention
notwithstanding
her
closed
eyelids
i
see
a
pretty
garden
why
do
you
enter
by
the
river
and
the
garden
said
minoret
because
they
are
who
the
young
girl
and
her
nurse
whom
you
are
thinking
what
is
the
garden
like
said
minoret
entering
by
the
steps
which
go
down
to
the
river
there
is
the
right
a
long
brick
gallery
in
which
i
see
books
it
ends
in
a
singular
building
there
are
wooden
bells
and
a
pattern
of
red
eggs
to
the
left
the
wall
is
covered
with
climbing
plants
wild
grapes
virginia
jessamine
in
the
middle
is
a
there
are
many
plants
in
pots
your
child
is
looking
at
the
flowers
she
shows
them
to
her
nurse
she
is
making
holes
in
the
earth
with
her
trowel
and
planting
seeds
the
nurse
is
raking
the
path
the
young
girl
is
pure
as
an
angel
but
the
beginning
of
love
is
there
faint
as
the
dawn
love
for
whom
asked
the
doctor
who
until
now
would
have
listened
to
no
word
said
to
him
by
somnambulists
he
considered
it
all
jugglery
you
know
nothing
though
you
have
lately
been
uneasy
about
her
health
answered
the
woman
her
heart
has
followed
the
dictates
of
a
woman
of
the
people
to
talk
like
this
cried
the
doctor
in
the
state
she
is
in
all
persons
speak
with
extraordinary
perception
said
bouvard
but
who
is
it
that
ursula
loves
ursula
does
not
know
that
she
loves
said
the
woman
with
a
shake
of
the
head
she
is
too
angelic
to
know
what
love
is
but
her
mind
is
occupied
by
him
she
thinks
of
him
she
tries
to
escape
the
thought
but
she
returns
to
it
in
spite
of
her
will
to
she
is
at
the
piano
but
who
is
he
the
son
of
a
lady
who
lives
madame
de
portenduere
portenduere
did
you
say
replied
the
sleeper
perhaps
so
but
there
s
no
danger
he
is
not
in
the
have
they
spoken
to
each
other
asked
the
doctor
never
they
have
looked
at
one
another
she
thinks
him
charming
he
is
in
fact
a
fine
man
he
has
a
good
heart
she
sees
him
from
her
window
they
see
each
other
in
church
but
the
young
man
no
longer
thinks
of
his
name
ah
to
tell
you
that
i
must
read
it
or
hear
it
he
is
named
savinien
she
has
just
spoken
his
name
she
thinks
it
sweet
to
say
she
has
looked
in
the
almanac
for
his
and
marked
a
red
dot
against
it
child
s
play
that
ah
she
will
love
well
with
as
much
strength
as
purity
she
is
not
a
girl
to
love
twice
love
will
so
dye
her
soul
and
fill
it
that
she
will
reject
all
other
where
do
you
see
that
in
her
she
will
know
how
to
suffer
she
inherits
that
her
father
and
her
mother
suffered
the
last
words
overcame
the
doctor
who
felt
less
shaken
than
surprised
it
is
proper
to
state
that
between
her
sentences
the
woman
paused
for
several
minutes
during
which
time
her
attention
became
more
and
more
concentrated
she
was
seen
to
see
her
forehead
had
a
singular
aspect
an
inward
effort
appeared
there
it
seemed
to
clear
or
cloud
by
some
mysterious
power
the
effects
of
which
minoret
had
seen
in
dying
persons
at
moments
when
they
appeared
to
have
the
gift
of
prophecy
several
times
she
made
gestures
which
resembled
those
of
ursula
question
her
said
the
mysterious
stranger
to
minoret
she
will
tell
you
secrets
you
alone
can
does
ursula
love
me
asked
minoret
almost
as
much
as
she
loves
god
was
the
answer
but
she
is
very
unhappy
at
your
unbelief
you
do
not
believe
in
god
as
if
you
could
prevent
his
existence
his
word
fills
the
universe
you
are
the
cause
of
her
only
hear
she
is
playing
scales
she
longs
to
be
a
better
musician
than
she
is
she
is
provoked
with
herself
she
is
thinking
if
i
could
sing
if
my
voice
were
fine
it
would
reach
his
ear
when
he
is
with
his
doctor
minoret
took
out
his
and
noted
the
hour
tell
me
what
seeds
she
planted
mignonette
balsams
and
what
else
where
is
my
money
with
your
notary
but
you
invest
it
so
as
not
to
lose
the
interest
of
a
single
yes
but
where
is
the
money
that
i
keep
for
my
monthly
expenses
you
put
it
in
a
large
book
bound
in
red
entitled
pandects
of
justinian
vol
between
the
last
two
leaves
the
book
is
on
the
shelf
of
folios
above
the
glass
buffet
you
have
a
whole
row
of
them
your
money
is
in
the
last
volume
next
to
the
salon
see
vol
iii
is
before
vol
but
you
have
no
money
it
is
all
in
notes
said
the
doctor
i
can
not
see
they
are
folded
no
there
are
two
notes
of
five
hundred
you
see
them
how
do
they
look
one
is
old
and
yellow
the
other
white
and
this
last
phase
of
the
inquiry
petrified
the
doctor
he
looked
at
bouvard
with
a
bewildered
air
but
bouvard
and
the
swedenborgian
who
were
accustomed
to
the
amazement
of
sceptics
were
speaking
together
in
a
low
voice
and
appeared
not
to
notice
him
minoret
begged
them
to
allow
him
to
return
after
dinner
the
old
philosopher
wished
to
compose
his
mind
and
shake
off
this
terror
so
as
to
put
this
vast
power
to
some
new
test
to
subject
it
to
more
decisive
experiments
and
obtain
answers
to
certain
questions
the
truth
of
which
should
do
away
with
every
sort
of
doubt
be
here
at
nine
o
clock
this
evening
said
the
stranger
i
will
return
to
meet
doctor
minoret
was
in
so
convulsed
a
state
that
he
left
the
room
without
bowing
followed
by
bouvard
who
called
to
him
from
behind
well
what
do
you
say
what
do

i
think
i
am
mad
bouvard
answered
minoret
from
the
steps
of
the
if
that
woman
tells
the
truth
about
ursula
and
none
but
ursula
can
know
the
things
that
sorceress
has
told
me
i
shall
say
that
are
i
wish
i
had
wings
to
fly
to
nemours
this
minute
and
verify
her
words
but
i
shall
hire
a
carriage
and
start
at
ten
o
clock
ah
am
i
losing
my
senses
what
would
you
say
if
you
knew
of
a
incurable
disease
healed
in
a
moment
if
you
saw
that
great
magnetizer
bring
sweat
in
torrents
from
an
herpetic
patient
or
make
a
paralyzed
woman
walk
come
and

bouvard
stay
with
me
till
nine
o
clock
i
must
find
some
decisive
undeniable
test
so
be

old
comrade
answered
the
other
the
reconciled
enemies
dined
in
the
after
a
lively
conversation
which
helped
minoret
to
evade
the
fever
of
the
ideas
which
were
ravaging
his
brain
bouvard
said
to
him
if
you
admit
in
that
woman
the
faculty
of
annihilating
or
of
traversing
space
if
you
obtain
a
certainty
that
here
in
paris
she
sees
and
hears
what
is
said
and
done
in
nemours
you
must
admit
all
other
magnetic
facts
they
are
not
more
incredible
than
these
ask
her
for
some
one
proof
which
you
know
will
satisfy
you
for
you
might
suppose
that
we
obtained
information
to
deceive
you
but
we
can
not
know
for
instance
what
will
happen
at
nine
o
clock
in
your
goddaughter
s
bedroom
remember
or
write
down
what
the
sleeper
will
see
and
hear
and
then
go
home
your
little
ursula
whom
i
do
not
know
is
not
our
accomplice
and
if
she
tells
you
that
she
has
said
and
done
what
you
have
written
down

thy
head
proud
hun
the
two
friends
returned
to
the
house
opposite
to
the
assumption
and
found
the
somnambulist
who
in
her
waking
state
did
not
recognize
doctor
minoret
the
eyes
of
this
woman
closed
gently
before
the
hand
of
the
swedenborgian
which
was
stretched
towards
her
at
a
little
distance
and
she
took
the
attitude
in
which
minoret
had
first
seen
her
when
her
hand
and
that
of
the
doctor
were
again
joined
he
asked
her
to
tell
him
what
was
happening
in
his
house
at
nemours
at
that
instant
what
is
ursula
doing
he
said
she
is
undressed
she
has
just
curled
her
hair
she
is
kneeling
on
her
before
an
ivory
crucifix
fastened
to
a
red
velvet
what
is
she
saying
her
evening
prayers
she
is
commending
herself
to
god
she
implores
him
to
save
her
soul
from
evil
thoughts
she
examines
her
conscience
and
recalls
what
she
has
done
during
the
day
that
she
may
know
if
she
has
failed
to
obey
his
commands
and
those
of
the
church
poor
dear
little
soul
she
lays
bare
her
breast
tears
were
in
the
sleeper
s
eyes
she
has
done
no
sin
but
she
blames
herself
for
thinking
too
much
of
savinien
she
stops
to
wonder
what
he
is
doing
in
paris
she
prays
to
god
to
make
him
happy
she
speaks
of
you
she
is
praying
tell
me
her
minoret
took
his
pencil
and
wrote
as
the
sleeper
uttered
it
the
following
prayer
evidently
composed
by
the
abbe
chaperon
my
god
if
thou
art
content
with
thine
handmaid
who
worships
thee
and
prays
to
thee
with
a
love
that
is
equal
to
her
devotion
who
strives
not
to
wander
from
thy
sacred
paths
who
would
gladly
die
as
thy
son
died
to
glorify
thy
name
who
desires
to
live
in
the
shadow
of
thy
will
o
god
who
knoweth
the
heart
open
the
eyes
of
my
godfather

him
in
the
way
of
salvation
grant
him
thy
divine
grace
that
he
may
live
for
thee
in
his
last
days
save
him
from
evil
and
let
me
suffer
in
his
stead
kind
saint
ursula
dear
protectress
and
you
mother
of

queen
of

archangels
and
saints
in

hear
me
join
your
intercessions
to
mine
and
have
mercy
upon
the
sleeper
imitated
so
perfectly
the
artless
gestures
and
the
inspired
manner
of
his
child
that
doctor
minoret
s
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
does
she
say
more
he
asked
repeat
my
dear
godfather
i
wonder
who
plays
backgammon
with
him
in
she
has
blown
out
the
light
her
head

on
the
pillow
she
turns
to

ah
she
is
off
how
pretty
she
looks
in
her
little
minoret
bowed
to
the
great
unknown
wrung
bouvard
by
the
hand
ran
downstairs
and
hastened
to
a
which
at
that
time
was
near
the
gates
of
a
house
since
pulled
down
to
make
room
for
the
rue
d
alger
there
he
found
a
coachman
who
was
willing
to
start
immediately
for
fontainebleau
the
moment
the
price
was
agreed
on
the
old
man
who
seemed
to
have
renewed
his
youth
jumped
into
the
carriage
and
started
according
to
agreement
he
stopped
to
rest
the
horse
at
essonne
but
arrived
at
fontainebleau
in
time
for
the
diligence
to
nemours
on
which
he
secured
a
seat
and
dismissed
his
coachman
he
reached
home
at
five
in
the
morning
and
went
to
bed
with
his
ideas
of
physiology
nature
and
metaphysics
in
ruins
about
him
and
slept
till
nine
o
clock
so
wearied
was
he
with
the
events
of
his
journey
chapter
vii
a
conversion
on
rising
the
doctor
sure
that
no
one
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
his
house
since
he
it
proceeded
but
not
without
extreme
trepidation
to
verify
his
facts
he
was
himself
ignorant
of
any
difference
in
the
and
also
of
the
misplacement
of
the
pandect
volumes
the
somnambulist
was
right
the
doctor
rang
for
la
bougival
tell
ursula
to
come
and
speak
to
me
he
said
seating
himself
in
the
center
of
his
library
the
girl
came
she
ran
up
to
him
and
kissed
him
the
doctor
took
her
on
his
knee
where
she
sat
contentedly
mingling
her
soft
fair
curls
with
the
white
hair
of
her
old
friend
do
you
want
something
godfather
yes
but
promise
me
on
your
salvation
to
answer
frankly
without
evasion
the
questions
that
i
shall
put
to
ursula
colored
to
the
temples
oh
i
ll
ask
nothing
that
you
can
not
speak
of
he
said
noticing
how
the
bashfulness
of
young
love
clouded
the
hitherto
childlike
purity
of
the
girl
s
blue
eyes
ask
me
what
thought
was
in
your
mind
when
you
ended
your
prayers
last
evening
and
what
time
was
it
when
you
said
it
was
a
or
well
repeat
your
last
the
girl
fancied
that
her
voice
might
convey
her
faith
to
the
sceptic
she
slid
from
his
knee
and
knelt
down
clasping
her
hands
fervently
a
brilliant
light
illumined
her
face
as
she
turned
it
on
the
old
man
and
said
what
i
asked
of
god
last
night
i
asked
again
this
morning
and
i
shall
ask
it
till
he
vouchsafes
to
grant
then
she
repeated
her
prayer
with
new
and
still
more
powerful
expression
to
her
great
astonishment
her
godfather
took
the
last
words
from
her
mouth
and
finished
the
prayer
good
ursula
said
the
doctor
taking
her
again
on
his
knee
when
you
laid
your
head
on
the
pillow
and
went
to
sleep
did
you
think
to
yourself
that
dear
godfather
i
wonder
who
is
playing
backgammon
with
him
in
paris
ursula
sprang
up
as
if
the
last
trumpet
had
sounded
in
her
ears
she
gave
a
cry
of
terror
her
eyes
wide
open
gazed
at
the
old
man
with
awful
fixity
who
are
you
godfather
from
whom
do
you
get
such
power
she
asked
imagining
that
in
his
desire
to
deny
god
he
had
made
some
compact
with
the
devil
what
seeds
did
you
plant
yesterday
in
the
garden
mignonette
balsams
and
the
last
were
larkspur
she
fell
on
her
knees
do
not
terrify
me
she
exclaimed
oh
you
must
have
been
here
you
were
here
were
you
not
am
i
not
always
with
you
replied
the
doctor
evading
her
question
to
save
the
strain
on
the
young
girl
s
mind
let
us
go
to
your
your
legs
are
trembling
she
said
yes
i
am
confounded
as
it
can
it
be
that
you
believe
in
god
she
cried
with
artless
joy
letting
fall
the
tears
that
gathered
in
her
eyes
the
old
man
looked
round
the
simple
but
dainty
little
room
he
had
given
to
his
ursula
on
the
floor
was
a
plain
green
carpet
very
inexpensive
which
she
herself
kept
exquisitely
clean
the
walls
were
hung
with
a
gray
paper
strewn
with
roses
and
green
leaves
at
the
windows
which
looked
to
the
court
were
calico
curtains
edged
with
a
band
of
some
pink
material
between
the
windows
and
beneath
a
tall
mirror
was
a
topped
with
marble
on
which
stood
a
sevres
vase
in
which
she
put
her
nosegays
opposite
the
chimney
was
a
little
of
charming
marquetry
the
bed
of
chintz
with
chintz
curtains
lined
with
pink
was
one
of
those
duchess
beds
so
common
in
the
eighteenth
century
which
had
a
tuft
of
carved
feathers
at
the
top
of
each
of
the
four
posts
which
were
fluted
on
the
sides
an
old
clock
inclosed
in
a
sort
of
monument
made
of
inlaid
with
arabesques
of
ivory
decorated
the
mantelpiece
the
marble
shelf
of
which
with
the
candlesticks
and
the
mirror
in
a
frame
painted
in
cameo
on
a
gray
ground
presented
a
remarkable
harmony
of
color
tone
and
style
a
large
wardrobe
the
doors
of
which
were
inlaid
with
landscapes
in
different
woods
some
having
a
green
tint
which
are
no
longer
to
be
found
for
sale
contained
no
doubt
her
linen
and
her
dresses
the
air
of
the
room
was
redolent
of
heaven
the
precise
arrangement
of
everything
showed
a
sense
of
order
a
feeling
for
harmony
which
would
certainly
have
influenced
any
one
even
a
it
was
plain
that
the
things
about
her
were
dear
to
ursula
and
that
she
loved
a
room
which
contained
as
it
were
her
childhood
and
the
whole
of
her
girlish
life
looking
the
room
well
over
that
he
might
seem
to
have
a
reason
for
his
visit
the
doctor
saw
at
once
how
the
windows
looked
into
those
of
madame
de
portenduere
during
the
night
he
had
meditated
as
to
the
course
he
ought
to
pursue
with
ursula
about
his
discovery
of
this
dawning
passion
to
question
her
now
would
commit
him
to
some
course
he
must
either
approve
or
disapprove
of
her
love
in
either
case
his
position
would
be
a
false
one
he
therefore
resolved
to
watch
and
examine
into
the
state
of
things
between
the
two
young
people
and
learn
whether
it
were
his
duty
to
check
the
inclination
before
it
was
irresistible
none
but
an
old
man
could
have
shown
such
deliberate
wisdom
still
panting
from
the
discovery
of
the
truth
of
these
magnetic
facts
he
turned
about
and
looked
at
all
the
various
little
things
around
the
room
he
wished
to
examine
the
almanac
which
was
hanging
at
a
corner
of
the
these
ugly
things
are
too
heavy
for
your
little
hands
he
said
taking
up
the
marble
candlesticks
which
were
partly
covered
with
leather
he
weighed
them
in
his
hand
then
he
looked
at
the
almanac
and
took
it
saying
this
is
ugly
too
why
do
you
keep
such
a
common
thing
in
your
pretty
room
oh
please
let
me
have
it
no
no
you
shall
have
another
so
saying
he
carried
off
this
possible
proof
shut
himself
up
in
his
study
looked
for
saint
savinien
and
found
as
the
somnambulist
had
told
him
a
little
red
dot
at
the
of
october
he
also
saw
another
before
his
own
saint
s
day
saint
denis
and
a
third
before
saint
john
the
abbe
s
patron
this
little
dot
no
larger
than
a
pin
s
head
had
been
seen
by
the
sleeping
woman
in
spite
of
distance
and
other
obstacles
the
old
man
thought
till
evening
of
these
events
more
momentous
for
him
than
for
others
he
was
forced
to
yield
to
evidence
a
strong
wall
as
it
were
crumbled
within
him
for
his
life
had
rested
on
two
bases
indifference
in
matters
of
religion
and
a
firm
disbelief
in
magnetism
when
it
was
proved
to
him
that
the
senses
faculties
purely
physical
organs
the
effects
of
which
could
be
explained
attained
to
some
of
the
attributes
of
the
infinite
magnetism
upset
or
at
least
it
seemed
to
him
to
upset
the
powerful
arguments
of
spinoza
the
finite
and
the
infinite
two
incompatible
elements
according
to
that
remarkable
man
were
here
united
the
one
in
the
other
no
matter
what
power
he
gave
to
the
divisibility
and
mobility
of
matter
he
could
not
help
recognizing
that
it
possessed
qualities
that
were
almost
divine
he
was
too
old
now
to
connect
those
phenomena
to
a
system
and
compare
them
with
those
of
sleep
of
vision
of
light
his
whole
scientific
belief
based
on
the
assertions
of
the
school
of
locke
and
condillac
was
in
ruins
seeing
his
hollow
ideas
in
pieces
his
scepticism
staggered
thus
the
advantage
in
this
struggle
between
the
catholic
child
and
the
voltairean
old
man
was
on
ursula
s
side
in
the
dismantled
fortress
above
these
ruins
shone
a
light
from
the
center
of
these
ashes
issued
the
path
of
prayer
nevertheless
the
obstinate
old
scientist
fought
his
doubts
though
struck
to
the
heart
he
would
not
decide
he
struggled
on
against
god
but
he
was
no
longer
the
same
man
his
mind
showed
its
vacillation
he
became
unnaturally
dreamy
he
read
pascal
and
bossuet
s
sublime
history
of
species
he
read
bonald
he
read
he
determined
also
to
read
the
works
of
swedenborg
and
the
late
which
the
mysterious
stranger
had
mentioned
to
him
the
edifice
within
him
was
cracking
on
all
sides
it
needed
but
one
more
shake
and
then
his
heart
being
ripe
for
god
he
was
destined
to
fall
into
the
celestial
vineyard
as
fall
the
fruits
often
of
an
evening
when
playing
with
the
abbe
his
goddaughter
sitting
by
he
would
put
questions
bearing
on
his
opinions
which
seemed
singular
to
the
priest
who
was
ignorant
of
the
inward
workings
by
which
god
was
remaking
that
fine
conscience
do
you
believe
in
apparitions
asked
the
sceptic
of
the
pastor
stopping
short
in
the
game
cardan
a
great
philosopher
of
the
sixteenth
century
said
he
had
seen
some
replied
the
abbe
i
know
all
those
that
scholars
have
discussed
for
i
have
just
reread
plotinus
i
am
questioning
you
as
a
catholic
might
and
i
ask
if
you
think
that
dead
men
can
return
to
the
jesus
reappeared
to
his
disciples
after
his
death
said
the
abbe
the
church
ought
to
have
faith
in
the
apparitions
of
the
savior
as
for
miracles
they
are
not
lacking
he
continued
smiling
shall
i
tell
you
the
last
it
took
place
in
the
eighteenth
pooh
said
the
doctor
yes
the
blessed
of
ligouri
being
very
far
from
rome
knew
of
the
death
of
the
pope
at
the
very
moment
the
holy
father
expired
there
were
numerous
witnesses
of
this
miracle
the
sainted
bishop
being
in
ecstasy
heard
the
last
words
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
and
repeated
them
at
the
time
to
those
about
him
the
courier
who
brought
the
announcement
of
the
death
did
not
arrive
till
thirty
hours
jesuit
exclaimed
old
minoret
laughing
i
did
not
ask
you
for
proofs
i
asked
you
if
you
believed
in
i
think
an
apparition
depends
a
good
deal
on
who
sees
it
said
the
abbe
still
fencing
with
his
sceptic
my
friend
said
the
doctor
seriously
i
am
not
setting
a
trap
for
you
what
do
you
really
believe
about
it
i
believe
that
the
power
of
god
is
infinite
replied
the
abbe
when
i
am
dead
if
i
am
reconciled
to
god
i
will
ask
him
to
let
me
appear
to
you
said
the
doctor
smiling
that
s
exactly
the
agreement
cardan
made
with
his
friend
answered
the
priest
ursula
said
minoret
if
danger
ever
threatens
you
call
me
and
i
will
you
have
put
into
one
sentence
that
beautiful
elegy
of
neere
by
andre
chenier
said
the
abbe
poets
are
sublime
because
they
clothe
both
facts
and
feelings
with
why
do
you
speak
of
your
death
dear
godfather
said
ursula
in
a
grieved
tone
we
christians
do
not
die
the
grave
is
the
cradle
of
our
well
said
the
doctor
smiling
we
must
go
out
of
the
world
and
when
i
am
no
longer
here
you
will
be
astonished
at
your
when
you
are
here
no
longer
my
kind
friend
my
only
consolation
will
be
to
consecrate
my
life
to
to
me
dead
yes
all
the
good
works
that
i
can
do
will
be
done
in
your
name
to
redeem
your
sins
i
will
pray
god
every
day
for
his
infinite
mercy
that
he
may
not
punish
eternally
the
errors
of
a
day
i
know
he
will
summon
among
the
righteous
a
soul
so
pure
so
beautiful
as
that
answer
said
with
angelic
candor
in
a
tone
of
absolute
certainty
confounded
error
and
converted
denis
minoret
as
god
converted
saul
a
ray
of
inward
light
overawed
him
the
knowledge
of
this
tenderness
covering
his
years
to
come
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
this
sudden
effect
of
grace
had
something
that
seemed
electrical
about
it
the
abbe
clasped
his
hands
and
rose
troubled
from
his
seat
the
girl
astonished
at
her
triumph
wept
the
old
man
stood
up
as
if
a
voice
had
called
him
looking
into
space
as
though
his
eyes
beheld
the
dawn
then
he
bent
his
knee
upon
his
chair
clasped
his
hands
and
lowered
his
eyes
to
the
ground
as
one
humiliated
my
god
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
raising
his
head
if
any
one
can
obtain
my
pardon
and
lead
me
to
thee
surely
it
is
this
spotless
creature
have
mercy
on
the
repentant
old
age
that
this
pure
child
presents
to
thee
he
lifted
his
soul
to
god
mentally
praying
for
the
light
of
divine
knowledge
after
the
gift
of
divine
grace
then
he
turned
to
the
abbe
and
held
out
his
hand
my
dear
pastor
he
said
i
am
become
as
a
little
child
i
belong
to
you
i
give
my
soul
to
your
ursula
kissed
his
hands
and
bathed
them
with
her
tears
the
old
man
took
her
on
his
knee
and
called
her
gayly
his
godmother
the
abbe
deeply
moved
recited
the
veni
creator
in
a
species
of
religious
ecstasy
the
hymn
served
as
the
evening
prayer
of
the
three
christians
kneeling
together
for
the
first
time
what
has
happened
asked
la
bougival
amazed
at
the
sight
my
godfather
believes
in
god
at
last
replied
ursula
ah
so
much
the
better
he
only
needed
that
to
make
him
perfect
cried
the
old
woman
crossing
herself
with
artless
gravity
dear
doctor
said
the
good
priest
you
will
soon
comprehend
the
grandeur
of
religion
and
the
value
of
its
practices
you
will
find
its
philosophy
in
human
aspects
far
higher
than
that
of
the
boldest
the
abbe
who
showed
a
joy
that
was
almost
infantine
agreed
to
catechize
the
old
man
and
confer
with
him
twice
a
week
thus
the
conversion
attributed
to
ursula
and
to
a
spirit
of
sordid
calculation
was
the
spontaneous
act
of
the
doctor
himself
the
abbe
who
for
fourteen
years
had
abstained
from
touching
the
wounds
of
that
heart
though
all
the
while
deploring
them
was
now
asked
for
help
as
a
surgeon
is
called
to
an
injured
man
ever
since
this
scene
ursula
s
evening
prayers
had
been
said
in
common
with
her
godfather
day
after
day
the
old
man
grew
more
conscious
of
the
peace
within
him
that
succeeded
all
his
conflicts
having
as
he
said
god
as
the
responsible
editor
of
things
inexplicable
his
mind
was
at
ease
his
dear
child
told
him
that
he
might
know
by
how
far
he
had
advanced
already
in
god
s
kingdom
during
the
mass
which
we
have
seen
him
attend
he
had
read
the
prayers
and
applied
his
own
intelligence
to
them
from
the
first
he
had
risen
to
the
divine
idea
of
the
communion
of
the
faithful
the
old
neophyte
understood
the
eternal
symbol
attached
to
that
sacred
nourishment
which
faith
renders
needful
to
the
soul
after
conveying
to
it
her
own
profound
and
radiant
essence
when
on
leaving
the
church
he
had
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
it
was
merely
that
he
might
once
more
thank
his
dear
child
for
having
led
him
to
enter
religion
the
beautiful
expression
of
former
days
he
was
holding
her
on
his
knee
in
the
salon
and
kissing
her
forehead
sacredly
at
the
very
moment
when
his
relatives
were
degrading
that
saintly
influence
with
their
shameless
fears
and
casting
their
vulgar
insults
upon
ursula
his
haste
to
return
home
his
assumed
disdain
for
their
company
his
sharp
replies
as
he
left
the
church
were
naturally
attributed
by
all
the
heirs
to
the
hatred
ursula
had
excited
against
them
in
the
old
man
s
mind
chapter
viii
the
conference
while
ursula
was
playing
variations
on
weber
s
last
thought
to
her
godfather
a
plot
was
hatching
in
the
which
was
destined
to
have
a
lasting
effect
on
the
events
of
this
drama
the
breakfast
noisy
as
all
provincial
breakfasts
are
and
enlivened
by
excellent
wines
brought
to
nemours
by
the
canal
either
from
burgundy
or
touraine
lasted
more
than
two
hours
zelie
had
sent
for
oysters
fish
and
other
gastronomical
delicacies
to
do
honor
to
desire
s
return
the
in
the
center
of
which
a
round
table
offered
a
most
appetizing
sight
was
like
the
hall
of
an
inn
content
with
the
size
of
her
kitchens
and
offices
zelie
had
built
a
pavilion
for
the
family
between
the
vast
courtyard
and
a
garden
planted
with
vegetables
and
full
of
everything
about
the
premises
was
solid
and
plain
the
example
of
had
been
a
warning
to
the
town
zelie
forbade
her
builder
to
lead
her
into
such
follies
the
was
therefore
hung
with
varnished
paper
and
furnished
with
walnut
chairs
and
sideboards
a
porcelain
stove
a
tall
clock
and
a
barometer
though
the
plates
and
dishes
were
of
common
white
china
the
table
shone
with
handsome
linen
and
abundant
silverware
after
zelie
had
served
the
coffee
coming
and
going
herself
like
shot
in
a
decanter
for
she
kept
but
one
servant
and
when
desire
the
budding
lawyer
had
been
told
of
the
event
of
the
morning
and
its
probably
consequences
the
door
was
closed
and
the
notary
dionis
was
called
upon
to
speak
by
the
silence
in
the
room
and
the
looks
that
were
cast
on
that
authoritative
face
it
was
easy
to
see
the
power
that
such
men
exercise
over
families
my
dear
children
said
he
your
uncle
having
been
born
in
is
years
old
at
the
present
time
now
old
men
are
given
to
folly
and
that
little
viper
cried
madame
massin
hussy
said
zelie
let
us
call
her
by
her
own
name
said
dionis
well
she
s
a
thief
said
madame
cremiere
a
pretty
thief
remarked
desire
that
little
ursula
went
on
dionis
has
managed
to
get
hold
of
his
heart
i
have
been
thinking
of
your
interests
and
i
did
not
wait
until
now
before
making
certain
inquiries
now
this
is
what
i
have
discovered
about
that
young
marauder
said
the
collector
inveigler
said
the
clerk
of
the
court
hold
your
tongue
friends
said
the
notary
or
i
ll
take
my
hat
and
be
come
come
papa
cried
minoret
pouring
out
a
little
glass
of
rum
and
offering
it
to
the
notary
here
drink
this
it
comes
from
rome
itself
and
now
go
ursula
is
it
is
true
the
legitimate
daughter
of
joseph
mirouet
but
her
father
was
the
natural
son
of
valentin
mirouet
your
uncle
s
being
therefore
an
illegitimate
niece
any
will
the
doctor
might
make
in
her
favor
could
probably
be
contested
and
if
he
leaves
her
his
fortune
in
that
way
you
could
bring
a
suit
against
ursula
this
however
might
turn
out
ill
for
you
in
case
the
court
took
the
view
that
there
was
no
relationship
between
ursula
and
the
doctor
still
the
suit
would
frighten
an
unprotected
girl
and
bring
about
a
compromise
the
law
is
so
rigid
as
to
the
rights
of
natural
children
said
the
newly
fledged
licentiate
eager
to
parade
his
knowledge
that
by
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
dated
july
a
natural
child
can
claim
nothing
from
his
natural
grandfather
not
even
a
maintenance
so
you
see
the
illegitimate
parentage
is
made
retrospective
the
law
pursues
the
natural
child
even
to
its
legitimate
descent
on
the
ground
that
benefactions
done
to
grandchildren
reach
the
natural
son
through
that
medium
this
is
shown
by
articles
and
of
the
civil
code
the
royal
court
of
paris
by
a
decision
of
the
of
january
of
last
year
cut
off
a
legacy
made
to
the
legitimate
child
of
a
natural
son
by
his
grandfather
who
as
grandfather
was
as
distant
to
a
natural
grandson
as
the
doctor
being
an
uncle
is
to
all
that
said
goupil
seems
to
me
to
relate
only
to
the
bequests
made
by
grandfathers
to
natural
descendants
ursula
is
not
a
blood
relation
of
doctor
minoret
i
remember
a
decision
of
the
royal
court
at
colmar
rendered
in
just
before
i
took
my
degree
which
declared
that
after
the
decease
of
a
natural
child
his
descendants
could
no
longer
be
prohibited
from
inheriting
now
ursula
s
father
is
goupil
s
argument
produced
what
journalists
who
report
the
sittings
of
legislative
assemblies
are
wont
to
call
profound
what
does
that
signify
cried
dionis
the
actual
case
of
the
bequest
of
an
uncle
to
an
illegitimate
child
may
not
yet
have
been
presented
for
trial
but
when
it
is
the
sternness
of
french
law
against
such
children
will
be
all
the
more
firmly
applied
because
we
live
in
times
when
religion
is
honored
i
ll
answer
for
it
that
out
of
such
a
suit
as
i
propose
you
could
get
a
compromise
especially
if
they
see
you
are
determined
to
carry
ursula
to
a
court
of
here
the
joy
of
the
heirs
already
fingering
their
gold
was
made
manifest
in
smiles
shrugs
and
gestures
round
the
table
and
prevented
all
notice
of
goupil
s
dissent
this
elation
however
was
succeeded
by
deep
silence
and
uneasiness
when
the
notary
uttered
his
next
word
a
terrible
but
as
if
he
had
pulled
the
string
of
a
starting
the
little
people
in
jerks
by
means
of
machinery
dionis
beheld
all
eyes
turned
on
him
and
all
faces
rigid
in
one
and
the
same
pose
no
law
prevents
your
uncle
from
adopting
or
marrying
ursula
he
continued
as
for
adoption
that
could
be
contested
and
you
would
i
think
have
equity
on
your
side
the
royal
courts
would
never
trifle
with
questions
of
adoptions
you
would
get
a
hearing
there
it
is
true
the
doctor
is
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
was
formerly
surgeon
to
the
but
nevertheless
he
would
get
the
worst
of
it
moreover
you
would
have
due
warning
in
case
of
adoption
but
how
about
marriage
old
minoret
is
shrewd
enough
to
go
to
paris
and
marry
her
after
a
year
s
domicile
and
give
her
a
million
by
the
marriage
contract
the
only
thing
therefore
that
really
puts
your
property
in
danger
is
your
uncle
s
marriage
with
the
here
the
notary
paused
there
s
another
danger
said
goupil
with
a
knowing
air
that
of
a
will
made
in
favor
of
a
third
person
old
bongrand
for
instance
who
will
hold
the
property
in
trust
for
mademoiselle
ursula
if
you
tease
your
uncle
continued
dionis
cutting
short
his
if
you
are
not
all
of
you
very
polite
to
ursula
you
will
drive
him
into
either
a
marriage
or
into
making
that
private
trust
which
goupil
speaks
of
though
i
don
t
think
him
capable
of
that
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
as
for
marriage
that
is
easy
to
prevent
desire
there
has
only
got
to
hold
out
a
finger
to
the
girl
she
s
sure
to
prefer
a
handsome
young
man
cock
of
the
walk
in
nemours
to
an
old
mother
said
desire
to
zelie
s
ear
as
much
allured
by
the
millions
as
by
ursula
s
beauty
if
i
married
her
we
should
get
the
whole
are
you
crazy
you
who
ll
some
day
have
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
be
made
a
deputy
as
long
as
i
live
you
never
shall
cut
your
throat
by
a
foolish
marriage
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
indeed
why
the
mayor
s
only
daughter
will
have
fifty
thousand
a
year
and
they
have
already
proposed
her
to
me
this
reply
the
first
rough
speech
his
mother
had
ever
made
to
him
extinguished
in
desire
s
breast
all
desire
for
a
marriage
with
the
beautiful
ursula
for
his
father
and
he
never
got
the
better
of
any
decision
once
written
in
the
terrible
blue
eyes
of
zelie
minoret
yes
but
see
here
monsieur
dionis
cried
cremiere
whose
wife
had
been
nudging
him
if
the
good
man
took
the
thing
seriously
and
married
his
goddaughter
to
desire
giving
her
the
reversion
of
all
the
property
to
our
share
in
it
if
he
lives
five
years
longer
uncle
may
be
worth
a
never
cried
zelie
never
in
my
life
shall
desire
marry
the
daughter
of
a
bastard
a
girl
picked
up
in
the
streets
out
of
charity
my
son
will
represent
the
minorets
after
the
death
of
his
uncle
and
the
minorets
have
five
hundred
years
of
good
bourgeoisie
behind
them
that
s
equal
to
the
nobility
don
t
be
uneasy
any
of
you
desire
will
marry
when
we
find
a
chance
to
put
him
in
the
chamber
of
this
lofty
declaration
was
backed
by
goupil
who
said
desire
with
an
allowance
of
thousand
francs
a
year
will
be
president
of
a
royal
court
or
either
office
leads
to
the
peerage
a
foolish
marriage
would
ruin
the
heirs
were
now
all
talking
at
once
but
they
suddenly
held
their
tongues
when
minoret
rapped
on
the
table
with
his
fist
to
keep
silence
for
the
notary
your
uncle
is
a
worthy
man
continued
dionis
he
believes
he
s
immortal
and
like
most
clever
men
he
ll
let
death
overtake
him
before
he
has
made
a
will
my
advice
therefore
is
to
induce
him
to
invest
his
capital
in
a
way
that
will
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
disinherit
you
and
i
know
of
an
opportunity
made
to
hand
that
little
portenduere
is
in
for
one
hundred
and
some
odd
thousand
francs
worth
of
debt
his
old
mother
knows
he
is
in
prison
she
is
crying
like
a
magdalen
the
abbe
is
to
dine
with
her
no
doubt
she
wants
to
talk
to
him
about
her
troubles
well
i
ll
go
and
see
your
uncle
and
persuade
him
to
sell
his
five
per
cent
consols
which
are
now
at
and
lend
madame
de
portenduere
on
the
security
of
her
farm
at
bordieres
and
her
house
here
enough
to
pay
the
debts
of
the
prodigal
son
i
have
a
right
as
notary
to
speak
to
him
in
behalf
of
young
portenduere
and
it
is
quite
natural
that
i
should
wish
to
make
him
change
his
investments
i
get
deeds
and
commissions
out
of
the
business
if
i
become
his
adviser
i
ll
propose
to
him
other
land
investments
for
his
surplus
capital
i
have
some
excellent
ones
now
in
my
office
if
his
fortune
were
once
invested
in
landed
estate
or
in
mortgage
notes
in
this
neighbourhood
it
could
not
take
wings
to
itself
very
easily
it
is
easy
to
make
difficulties
between
the
wish
to
realize
and
the
the
heirs
struck
with
the
truth
of
this
argument
much
cleverer
than
that
of
monsieur
josse
murmured
approval
you
must
be
careful
said
the
notary
in
conclusion
to
keep
your
uncle
in
nemours
where
his
habits
are
known
and
where
you
can
watch
him
find
him
a
lover
for
the
girl
and
you
ll
prevent
his
marrying
her
suppose
she
married
the
lover
said
goupil
seized
by
an
ambitious
desire
that
wouldn
t
be
a
bad
thing
then
you
could
figure
up
the
loss
the
old
man
would
have
to
say
how
much
he
gives
her
replied
the
notary
but
if
you
set
desire
at
her
he
could
keep
the
girl
dangling
on
till
the
old
man
died
marriages
are
made
and
the
shortest
way
said
goupil
if
the
doctor
is
likely
to
live
much
longer
is
to
marry
her
to
some
worthy
young
man
who
will
get
her
out
of
your
way
by
settling
at
sens
or
montargis
or
orleans
with
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
dionis
massin
zelie
and
goupil
the
only
intelligent
heads
in
the
company
exchanged
four
thoughtful
smiles
he
d
be
a
worm
at
the
core
whispered
zelie
to
massin
how
did
he
get
here
returned
the
clerk
that
will
just
suit
you
cried
desire
to
goupil
but
do
you
think
you
can
behave
decently
enough
to
satisfy
the
old
man
and
the
girl
in
these
days
whispered
zelie
again
in
massin
s
year
notaries
look
out
for
no
interests
but
their
own
suppose
dionis
went
over
to
ursula
just
to
get
the
old
man
s
business
i
am
sure
of
him
said
the
clerk
of
the
court
giving
her
a
sly
look
out
of
his
spiteful
little
eyes
he
was
just
going
to
add
because
i
hold
something
over
him
but
he
withheld
the
words
i
am
quite
of
dionis
s
opinion
he
said
aloud
so
am
i
cried
zelie
who
now
suspected
the
notary
of
collusion
with
the
clerk
my
wife
has
voted
said
the
post
master
sipping
his
brandy
though
his
face
was
already
purple
from
digesting
his
meal
and
absorbing
a
notable
quantity
of
liquids
and
very
properly
remarked
the
collector
i
shall
go
and
see
the
doctor
after
dinner
said
dionis
if
monsieur
dionis
s
advice
is
good
said
madame
cremiere
to
madame
massin
we
had
better
go
and
call
on
our
uncle
as
we
used
to
do
every
sunday
evening
and
behave
exactly
as
monsieur
dionis
has
told
yes
and
be
received
as
he
received
us
cried
zelie
minoret
and
i
have
more
than
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
yet
he
refused
our
invitations
we
are
quite
his
equals
if
i
don
t
know
how
to
write
prescriptions
i
know
how
to
paddle
my
boat
as
well
as
he
i
can
tell
him
that
as
i
am
far
from
having
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
said
madame
massin
rather
piqued
i
don
t
want
to
lose
ten
we
are
his
nieces
we
ought
to
take
care
of
him
and
then
besides
we
shall
see
how
things
are
going
said
madame
cremiere
you
ll
thank
us
some
day
treat
ursula
kindly
said
the
notary
lifting
his
right
forefinger
to
the
level
of
his
lips
remember
old
jordy
left
her
his
you
have
managed
those
fools
as
well
as
desroches
the
best
lawyer
in
paris
could
have
done
said
goupil
to
his
patron
as
they
left
the
and
now
they
are
quarreling
over
my
fee
replied
the
notary
smiling
bitterly
the
heirs
after
parting
with
dionis
and
his
clerk
met
again
in
the
square
with
face
rather
flushed
from
their
breakfast
just
as
vespers
were
over
as
the
notary
predicted
the
abbe
chaperon
had
madame
de
portenduere
on
his
arm
she
dragged
him
to
vespers
see
cried
madame
massin
to
madame
cremiere
pointing
to
ursula
and
the
doctor
who
were
leaving
the
church
let
us
go
and
speak
to
him
said
madame
cremiere
approaching
the
old
man
the
change
in
the
faces
of
his
relatives
produced
by
the
conference
did
not
escape
doctor
minoret
he
tried
to
guess
the
reason
of
this
sudden
amiability
and
out
of
sheer
curiosity
encouraged
ursula
to
stop
and
speak
to
the
two
women
who
were
eager
to
greet
her
with
exaggerated
affection
and
forced
smiles
uncle
will
you
permit
me
to
come
and
see
you
said
madame
cremiere
we
feared
sometimes
we
were
in
your
way
but
it
is
such
a
long
time
since
our
children
have
paid
you
their
respects
our
girls
are
old
enough
now
to
make
dear
ursula
s
ursula
is
a
little
bear
like
her
name
replied
the
doctor
let
us
tame
her
said
madame
massin
and
besides
uncle
added
the
good
housewife
trying
to
hide
her
real
motive
under
a
mask
of
economy
they
tell
us
the
dear
girl
has
such
talent
for
the
forte
that
we
are
very
anxious
to
hear
her
madame
cremiere
and
i
are
inclined
to
take
her
for
our
children
if
there
were
six
or
eight
scholars
in
a
class
it
would
bring
the
price
of
his
lessons
within
our
certainly
said
the
old
man
and
it
will
be
all
the
better
for
me
because
i
want
to
give
ursula
a
well
then
uncle
we
will
bring
your
desire
to
see
you
he
is
now
a
yes
echoed
minoret
meaning
to
fathom
the
motives
of
these
petty
souls
the
two
nieces
pressed
ursula
s
hand
saying
with
affected
eagerness
au
oh
godfather
you
have
read
my
heart
cried
ursula
giving
him
a
grateful
look
you
are
going
to
have
a
voice
he
said
and
i
shall
give
you
masters
of
drawing
and
italian
also
a
woman
added
the
doctor
looking
at
ursula
as
he
unfastened
the
gate
of
his
house
ought
to
be
educated
to
the
height
of
every
position
in
which
her
marriage
may
place
ursula
grew
red
as
a
cherry
her
godfather
s
thoughts
evidently
turned
in
the
same
direction
as
her
own
feeling
that
she
was
too
near
confessing
to
the
doctor
the
involuntary
attraction
which
led
her
to
think
about
savinien
and
to
center
all
her
ideas
of
affection
upon
him
she
turned
aside
and
sat
down
in
front
of
a
great
cluster
of
climbing
plants
on
the
dark
background
of
which
she
looked
at
a
distance
like
a
blue
and
white
flower
now
you
see
godfather
that
your
nieces
were
very
kind
to
me
yes
they
were
very
kind
she
repeated
as
he
approached
her
to
change
the
thoughts
that
made
him
pensive
poor
little
girl
cried
the
old
man
he
laid
ursula
s
hand
upon
his
arm
tapping
it
gently
and
took
her
to
the
terraces
beside
the
river
where
no
one
could
hear
them
why
do
you
say
poor
little
girl
don
t
you
see
how
they
fear
you
fear
me
why
my
next
of
kin
are
very
uneasy
about
my
conversion
they
no
doubt
attribute
it
to
your
influence
over
me
they
fancy
i
deprive
them
of
their
inheritance
to
enrich
but
you
won
t
do
that
said
ursula
naively
looking
up
at
him
oh
divine
consolation
of
my
old
age
said
the
doctor
taking
his
godchild
in
his
arms
and
kissing
her
on
both
cheeks
it
was
for
her
and
not
for
myself
oh
god
that
i
besought
thee
just
now
to
let
me
live
until
the
day
i
give
her
to
some
good
being
who
is
worthy
of
her
you
will
see
comedies
my
little
angel
comedies
which
the
minorets
and
cremieres
and
massins
will
come
and
play
here
you
want
to
brighten
and
prolong
my
life
they
are
longing
for
my
god
forbids
us
to
hate
any
one
but
if
that
is
ah
i
despise
them
exclaimed
ursula
dinner
is
ready
called
la
bougival
from
the
portico
which
on
the
garden
side
was
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
chapter
ix
a
first
confidence
ursula
and
her
godfather
were
sitting
at
dessert
in
the
pretty
decorated
with
chinese
designs
in
black
and
gold
lacquer
the
folly
of
when
the
justice
of
peace
arrived
the
doctor
offered
him
and
this
was
a
great
mark
of
intimacy
a
cup
of
his
coffee
a
mixture
of
mocha
with
bourbon
and
martinique
roasted
ground
and
made
by
himself
in
a
silver
apparatus
called
a
chaptal
well
said
bongrand
pushing
up
his
glasses
and
looking
slyly
at
the
old
man
the
town
is
in
commotion
your
appearance
in
church
has
put
your
relatives
beside
themselves
you
have
left
your
fortune
to
the
priests
to
the
poor
you
have
roused
the
families
and
they
are
bestirring
themselves
ha
ha
i
saw
their
first
irruption
into
the
square
they
were
as
busy
as
ants
who
have
lost
their
what
did
i
tell
you
ursula
cried
the
doctor
at
the
risk
of
grieving
you
my
child
i
must
teach
you
to
know
the
world
and
put
you
on
your
guard
against
undeserved
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
to
you
on
this
subject
said
bongrand
seizing
the
occasion
to
speak
to
his
old
friend
of
ursula
s
future
the
doctor
put
a
black
velvet
cap
on
his
white
head
the
justice
of
peace
wore
his
hat
to
protect
him
from
the
night
air
and
they
walked
up
and
down
the
terrace
discussing
the
means
of
securing
to
ursula
what
her
godfather
intended
to
bequeath
her
bongrand
knew
dionis
s
opinion
as
to
the
invalidity
of
a
will
made
by
the
doctor
in
favor
of
ursula
for
nemours
was
so
preoccupied
with
the
minoret
affairs
that
the
matter
had
been
much
discussed
among
the
lawyers
of
the
little
town
bongrand
considered
that
ursula
was
not
a
relative
of
doctor
minoret
but
he
felt
that
the
whole
spirit
of
legislation
was
against
the
foisting
into
families
of
illegitimate
the
makers
of
the
code
had
foreseen
only
the
weakness
of
fathers
and
mothers
for
their
natural
children
without
considering
that
uncles
and
aunts
might
have
a
like
tenderness
and
a
desire
to
provide
for
such
children
evidently
there
was
a
gap
in
the
law
in
all
other
countries
he
said
ending
an
explanation
of
the
legal
points
which
dionis
goupil
and
desire
had
just
explained
to
the
heirs
ursula
would
have
nothing
to
fear
she
is
a
legitimate
child
and
the
disability
of
her
father
ought
only
to
affect
the
inheritance
from
valentine
mirouet
her
grandfather
but
in
france
the
magistracy
is
unfortunately
overwise
and
very
consequential
it
inquires
into
the
spirit
of
the
law
some
lawyers
talk
morality
and
might
try
to
show
that
this
hiatus
in
the
code
came
from
the
of
the
legislators
who
did
not
foresee
the
case
though
none
the
less
they
established
a
principle
to
bring
a
suit
would
be
long
and
expensive
zelie
would
carry
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
might
not
be
alive
when
the
case
was
the
best
of
cases
is
often
worthless
cried
the
doctor
here
s
the
question
the
lawyers
will
put
to
what
degree
of
relationship
ought
the
disability
of
natural
children
in
matters
of
inheritance
to
extend
and
the
credit
of
a
good
lawyer
will
lie
in
gaining
a
bad
faith
said
bongrand
i
dare
not
take
upon
myself
to
affirm
that
the
judges
wouldn
t
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
law
as
increasing
the
protection
given
to
marriage
the
eternal
base
of
without
explaining
his
intentions
the
doctor
rejected
the
idea
of
a
trust
when
bongrand
suggested
to
him
a
marriage
with
ursula
as
the
surest
means
of
securing
his
property
to
her
he
exclaimed
poor
little
girl
i
might
live
fifteen
years
what
a
fate
for
her
well
what
will
you
do
then
asked
bongrand
we
ll
think
about
it
i
ll
see
said
the
old
man
evidently
at
a
loss
for
a
reply
just
then
ursula
came
to
say
that
monsieur
dionis
wished
to
speak
to
the
doctor
already
cried
minoret
looking
at
bongrand
yes
he
said
to
ursula
send
him
i
ll
bet
my
spectacles
to
a
bunch
of
matches
that
he
is
the
of
your
heirs
said
bongrand
they
breakfasted
together
at
the
post
house
and
something
is
being
the
notary
conducted
by
ursula
came
to
the
lower
end
of
the
garden
after
the
usual
greetings
and
a
few
insignificant
remarks
dionis
asked
for
a
private
interview
ursula
and
bongrand
retired
to
the
salon
the
distrust
which
superior
men
excite
in
men
of
business
is
very
remarkable
the
latter
deny
them
the
lesser
powers
while
recognizing
their
possession
of
the
it
is
perhaps
a
tribute
to
them
seeing
them
always
on
the
higher
plane
of
human
things
men
of
business
believe
them
incapable
of
descending
to
the
infinitely
petty
details
which
like
the
dividends
of
finance
and
the
microscopic
facts
of
science
go
to
equalize
capital
and
to
form
the
worlds
they
are
mistaken
the
man
of
honor
and
of
genius
sees
all
bongrand
piqued
by
the
doctor
s
silence
but
impelled
by
a
sense
of
ursula
s
interests
which
he
thought
endangered
resolved
to
defend
her
against
the
heirs
he
was
wretched
at
not
knowing
what
was
taking
place
between
the
old
man
and
dionis
no
matter
how
pure
and
innocent
ursula
may
be
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
her
there
is
a
point
on
which
young
girls
do
make
their
own
law
and
their
own
morality
i
ll
test
here
the
he
began
settling
his
spectacles
might
possibly
ask
you
in
marriage
for
their
the
poor
child
turned
pale
she
was
too
well
trained
and
had
too
much
delicacy
to
listen
to
what
dionis
was
saying
to
her
uncle
but
after
a
moment
s
inward
deliberation
she
thought
she
might
show
herself
and
then
if
she
was
in
the
way
her
godfather
would
let
her
know
it
the
chinese
pagoda
which
the
doctor
made
his
study
had
outside
blinds
to
the
glass
doors
ursula
invented
the
excuse
of
shutting
them
she
begged
monsieur
bongrand
s
pardon
for
leaving
him
alone
in
the
salon
but
he
smiled
at
her
and
said
go
go
ursula
went
down
the
steps
of
the
portico
which
led
to
the
pagoda
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
she
stood
for
some
minutes
slowly
arranging
the
blinds
and
watching
the
sunset
the
doctor
and
notary
were
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
but
as
they
turned
she
heard
the
doctor
make
an
answer
which
reached
the
pagoda
where
she
was
my
heirs
would
be
delighted
to
see
me
invest
my
property
in
real
estate
or
mortgages
they
imagine
it
would
be
safer
there
i
know
exactly
what
they
are
saying
perhaps
you
come
from
them
let
me
tell
you
my
good
sir
that
my
disposition
of
my
property
is
irrevocably
made
my
heirs
will
have
the
capital
i
brought
here
with
me
i
wish
them
to
know
that
and
to
let
me
alone
if
any
one
of
them
attempts
to
interfere
with
what
i
think
proper
to
do
for
that
young
girl
pointing
to
ursula
i
shall
come
back
from
the
other
world
and
torment
him
so
monsieur
savinien
de
portenduere
will
stay
in
prison
if
they
count
on
me
to
get
him
out
i
shall
not
sell
my
property
in
the
hearing
this
last
fragment
of
the
sentence
ursula
experienced
the
first
and
only
pain
which
so
far
had
ever
touched
her
she
laid
her
head
against
the
blind
to
steady
herself
good
god
what
is
the
matter
with
her
thought
the
old
doctor
she
has
no
color
such
an
emotion
after
dinner
might
kill
he
went
to
her
with
open
arms
and
she
fell
into
them
almost
fainting
adieu
monsieur
he
said
to
the
notary
please
leave
he
carried
his
child
to
an
immense
louis
xv
sofa
which
was
in
his
study
looked
for
a
phial
of
hartshorn
among
his
remedies
and
made
her
inhale
it
take
my
place
said
the
doctor
to
bongrand
who
was
terrified
i
must
be
alone
with
the
justice
of
peace
accompanied
the
notary
to
the
gate
asking
him
but
without
showing
any
eagerness
what
was
the
matter
with
ursula
i
don
t
know
replied
dionis
she
was
standing
by
the
pagoda
listening
to
us
and
just
as
her
uncle
refused
to
lend
some
money
at
my
request
to
young
de
portenduere
who
is
in
prison
for
debt
for
he
has
not
had
like
monsieur
du
rouvre
a
monsieur
bongrand
to
defend
him
she
turned
pale
and
staggered
can
she
love
him
is
there
anything
between
them
at
fifteen
years
of
age
pooh
replied
bongrand
she
was
born
in
february
she
ll
be
sixteen
in
four
i
don
t
believe
she
ever
saw
him
said
the
judge
no
it
is
only
a
nervous
attack
of
the
heart
more
likely
said
the
notary
dionis
was
delighted
with
this
discovery
which
would
prevent
the
marriage
in
extremis
which
they
dreaded
the
only
sure
means
by
which
the
doctor
could
defraud
his
relatives
bongrand
on
the
other
hand
saw
a
private
castle
of
his
own
demolished
he
had
long
thought
of
marrying
his
son
to
ursula
if
the
poor
girl
loves
that
youth
it
will
be
a
misfortune
for
her
replied
bongrand
after
a
pause
madame
de
portenduere
is
a
breton
and
infatuated
with
her
noble
luckily
i
mean
for
the
honor
of
the
portendueres
replied
the
notary
on
the
point
of
betraying
himself
let
us
do
the
faithful
and
upright
bongrand
the
justice
to
say
that
before
he
the
salon
he
had
abandoned
not
without
deep
regret
for
his
son
the
hope
he
had
cherished
of
some
day
calling
ursula
his
daughter
he
meant
to
give
his
son
six
thousand
francs
a
year
the
day
he
was
appointed
substitute
and
if
the
doctor
would
give
ursula
a
hundred
thousand
francs
what
a
pearl
of
a
home
the
pair
would
make
his
eugene
was
so
loyal
and
charming
a
fellow
perhaps
he
had
praised
his
eugene
too
often
and
that
had
made
the
doctor
distrustful
i
shall
have
to
come
down
to
the
mayor
s
daughter
he
thought
but
ursula
without
any
money
is
worth
more
than
mademoiselle
with
a
million
however
the
thing
to
be
done
is
to
manoeuvre
the
marriage
with
this
little
portenduere
if
she
really
loves
the
doctor
after
closing
the
door
to
the
library
and
that
to
the
garden
took
his
goddaughter
to
the
window
which
opened
upon
the
river
what
ails
you
my
child
he
said
your
life
is
my
life
without
your
smiles
what
would
become
of
me
savinien
in
prison
she
said
with
these
words
a
shower
of
tears
fell
from
her
eyes
and
she
began
to
sob
saved
thought
the
doctor
who
was
holding
her
pulse
with
great
anxiety
alas
she
has
all
the
sensitiveness
of
my
poor
wife
he
thought
fetching
a
stethoscope
which
he
put
to
ursula
s
heart
applying
his
ear
to
it
ah
that
s
all
right
he
said
to
himself
i
did
not
know
my
darling
that
you
loved
any
one
as
yet
he
added
looking
at
her
but
think
out
loud
to
me
as
you
think
to
yourself
tell
me
all
that
has
passed
between
i
do
not
love
him
godfather
we
have
never
spoken
to
each
other
she
answered
sobbing
but
to
hear
that
he
is
in
prison
and
to
know
that
you
harshly
refused
to
get
him
out
you
so
good
ursula
my
dear
little
good
angel
if
you
do
not
love
him
why
did
you
put
that
little
red
dot
against
saint
savinien
s
day
just
as
you
put
one
before
that
of
saint
denis
come
tell
me
everything
about
your
little
ursula
blushed
swallowed
a
few
tears
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
between
them
surely
you
are
not
afraid
of
your
father
your
friend
mother
doctor
and
godfather
whose
heart
is
now
more
tender
than
it
ever
has
no
no
dear
godfather
she
said
i
will
open
my
heart
to
you
last
may
monsieur
savinien
came
to
see
his
mother
until
then
i
had
never
taken
notice
of
him
when
he
left
home
to
live
in
paris
i
was
a
child
and
i
did
not
see
any
difference
between
him
and
all
of
you
except
perhaps
that
i
loved
you
and
never
thought
of
loving
any
one
else
monsieur
savinien
came
by
the
the
night
before
his
mother
s
but
we
did
not
know
it
at
seven
the
next
morning
after
i
had
said
my
prayers
i
opened
the
window
to
air
my
room
and
i
saw
the
windows
in
monsieur
savinien
s
room
open
and
monsieur
savinien
was
there
in
a
dressing
gown
arranging
his
beard
in
all
his
movements
there
was
such
grace
i
mean
he
seemed
to
me
so
charming
he
combed
his
black
moustache
and
the
little
tuft
on
his
chin
and
i
saw
his
white
throat
so
round
must
i
tell
you
all
i
noticed
that
his
throat
and
face
and
that
beautiful
black
hair
were
all
so
different
from
yours
when
i
watch
you
arranging
your
beard
there
came
i
don
t
know
how
a
sort
of
glow
into
my
heart
and
up
into
my
throat
my
head
it
came
so
violently
that
i
sat
down
i
couldn
t
stand
i
trembled
so
but
i
longed
to
see
him
again
and
presently
i
got
up
he
saw
me
then
and
just
for
play
he
sent
me
a
kiss
from
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
and
and
then
she
continued
i
hid
myself
i
was
ashamed
but
happy
why
should
i
be
ashamed
of
being
happy
that
feeling
it
dazzled
my
soul
and
gave
it
some
power
but
i
don
t
know
what
it
came
again
each
time
i
saw
within
me
the
same
young
face
i
loved
this
feeling
violent
as
it
was
going
to
mass
some
unconquerable
power
made
me
look
at
monsieur
savinien
with
his
mother
on
his
arm
his
walk
his
clothes
even
the
tap
of
his
boots
on
the
pavement
seemed
to
me
so
charming
the
least
little
thing
about
him
his
hand
with
the
delicate
glove
acted
like
a
spell
upon
me
and
yet
i
had
strength
enough
not
to
think
of
him
during
mass
when
the
service
was
over
i
stayed
in
the
church
to
let
madame
de
portenduere
go
first
and
then
i
walked
behind
him
i
couldn
t
tell
you
how
these
little
things
excited
me
when
i
reached
home
i
turned
round
to
fasten
the
iron
gate
where
was
la
bougival
asked
the
doctor
oh
i
let
her
go
to
the
kitchen
said
ursula
simply
then
i
saw
monsieur
savinien
standing
quite
still
and
looking
at
me
oh
godfather
i
was
so
proud
for
i
thought
i
saw
a
look
in
his
eyes
of
surprise
and
admiration
i
don
t
know
what
i
would
not
do
to
make
him
look
at
me
again
like
that
it
seemed
to
me
i
ought
to
think
of
nothing
forevermore
but
pleasing
him
that
glance
is
now
the
best
reward
i
have
for
any
good
i
do
from
that
moment
i
have
thought
of
him
incessantly
in
spite
of
myself
monsieur
savinien
went
back
to
paris
that
evening
and
i
have
not
seen
him
since
the
street
seems
empty
he
took
my
heart
away
with
him
but
he
does
not
know
is
that
all
asked
the
old
man
all
dear
godfather
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
regret
that
there
was
not
more
to
tell
my
little
girl
said
the
doctor
putting
her
on
his
knee
you
are
nearly
sixteen
and
your
womanhood
is
beginning
you
are
now
between
your
blessed
childhood
which
is
ending
and
the
emotions
of
love
which
will
make
your
life
a
tumultuous
one
for
you
have
a
nervous
system
of
exquisite
sensibility
what
has
happened
to
you
my
child
is
love
said
the
old
man
with
an
expression
of
deepest
sadness
love
in
its
holy
simplicity
love
as
it
ought
to
be
involuntary
sudden
coming
like
a
thief
who
takes
all
yes
all
i
expected
it
i
have
studied
women
many
need
proofs
and
miracles
of
affection
before
love
conquers
them
but
others
there
are
under
the
influence
of
sympathies
explainable
by
magnetic
fluids
who
are
possessed
by
it
in
an
instant
to
you
i
can
now
tell
all
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
charming
woman
whose
name
you
bear
i
felt
that
i
should
love
her
forever
solely
and
faithfully
without
knowing
whether
our
characters
or
persons
suited
each
other
is
there
a
in
love
what
answer
can
i
give
to
that
i
who
have
seen
so
many
unions
formed
under
celestial
auspices
only
to
be
ruptured
later
giving
rise
to
hatreds
that
are
eternal
to
repugnances
that
are
unconquerable
the
senses
sometimes
harmonize
while
ideas
are
at
variance
and
some
persons
live
more
by
their
minds
than
by
their
bodies
the
contrary
is
also
true
often
minds
agree
and
persons
displease
these
phenomena
the
varying
and
secret
cause
of
many
sorrows
show
the
wisdom
of
laws
which
give
parents
supreme
power
over
the
marriages
of
their
children
for
a
young
girl
is
often
duped
by
one
or
other
of
these
hallucinations
therefore
i
do
not
blame
you
the
sensations
you
feel
the
rush
of
sensibility
which
has
come
from
its
hidden
source
upon
your
heart
and
upon
your
mind
the
happiness
with
which
you
think
of
savinien
are
all
natural
but
my
darling
child
society
demands
as
our
good
abbe
has
told
us
the
sacrifice
of
many
natural
inclinations
the
destinies
of
men
and
women
differ
i
was
able
to
choose
ursula
mirouet
for
my
wife
i
could
go
to
her
and
say
that
i
loved
her
but
a
young
girl
is
false
to
herself
if
she
asks
the
love
of
the
man
she
loves
a
woman
has
not
the
right
which
men
have
to
seek
the
accomplishment
of
her
hopes
in
open
day
modesty
is
to
her
above
all
to
you
my
ursula
the
insurmountable
barrier
which
protects
the
secrets
of
her
heart
your
hesitation
in
confiding
to
me
these
first
emotions
shows
me
you
would
suffer
cruel
torture
rather
than
admit
to
savinien
oh
yes
she
said
but
my
child
you
must
do
more
you
must
repress
these
feelings
you
must
forget
why
because
my
darling
you
must
love
only
the
man
you
marry
and
even
if
monsieur
savinien
de
portenduere
loved
you
i
never
thought
of
but
listen
even
if
he
loved
you
even
if
his
mother
asked
me
to
give
him
your
hand
i
should
not
consent
to
the
marriage
until
i
had
subjected
him
to
a
long
and
thorough
probation
his
conduct
has
been
such
as
to
make
families
distrust
him
and
to
put
obstacles
between
himself
and
heiresses
which
can
not
be
easily
a
soft
smile
came
in
place
of
tears
on
ursula
s
sweet
face
as
she
said
then
poverty
is
good
the
doctor
could
find
no
answer
to
such
innocence
what
has
he
done
godfather
she
asked
in
two
years
my
treasure
he
has
incurred
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
of
debt
he
has
had
the
folly
to
get
himself
locked
up
in
the
debtor
s
prison
an
impropriety
which
will
always
be
in
these
days
a
discredit
to
him
a
spendthrift
who
is
willing
to
plunge
his
poor
mother
into
poverty
and
distress
might
cause
his
wife
as
your
poor
father
did
to
die
of
don
t
you
think
he
will
do
better
she
asked
if
his
mother
pays
his
debts
he
will
be
penniless
and
i
don
t
know
a
worse
punishment
than
to
be
a
nobleman
without
this
answer
made
ursula
thoughtful
she
dried
her
tears
and
said
if
you
can
save
him
save
him
godfather
that
service
will
give
you
a
right
to
advise
him
you
can
remonstrate
yes
said
the
doctor
imitating
her
and
then
he
can
come
here
and
the
old
lady
will
come
here
and
we
shall
see
them
and
i
was
thinking
only
of
him
said
ursula
blushing
don
t
think
of
him
my
child
it
would
be
folly
said
the
doctor
gravely
madame
de
portenduere
who
was
a
kergarouet
would
never
consent
even
if
she
had
to
live
on
three
hundred
francs
a
year
to
the
marriage
of
her
son
the
vicomte
savinien
de
portenduere
with
whom
with
ursula
mirouet
daughter
of
a
bandsman
in
a
regiment
without
money
and
whose
father
alas
i
must
now
tell
you
all
was
the
bastard
son
of
an
organist
my
o
godfather
you
are
right
we
are
equal
only
in
the
sight
of
god
i
will
not
think
of
him
again
except
in
my
prayers
she
said
amid
the
sobs
which
this
painful
revelation
excited
give
him
what
you
meant
to
give
me
what
can
a
poor
girl
like
me
want
ah
in
prison
he
offer
to
god
your
disappointments
and
perhaps
he
will
help
there
was
silence
for
some
minutes
when
ursula
who
at
first
did
not
dare
to
look
at
her
godfather
raised
her
eyes
her
heart
was
deeply
moved
to
see
the
tears
which
were
rolling
down
his
withered
cheeks
the
tears
of
old
men
are
as
terrible
as
those
of
children
are
natural
oh
what
is
it
cried
ursula
flinging
herself
at
his
feet
and
kissing
his
hands
are
you
not
sure
of
me
i
who
longed
to
gratify
all
your
wishes
it
is
i
who
am
obliged
to
cause
the
first
great
sorrow
of
your
life
he
said
i
suffer
as
much
as
you
i
never
wept
before
except
when
i
lost
my
children
and
ursula
yes
he
cried
suddenly
i
will
do
all
you
desire
ursula
gave
him
through
her
tears
a
look
that
was
vivid
as
lightning
she
smiled
let
us
go
into
the
salon
darling
said
the
doctor
try
to
keep
the
secret
of
all
this
to
yourself
he
added
leaving
her
alone
for
a
moment
in
his
study
he
felt
himself
so
weak
before
that
heavenly
smile
that
he
feared
he
might
say
a
word
of
hope
and
thus
mislead
her
chapter
x
the
family
of
portenduere
madame
de
portenduere
was
at
this
moment
alone
with
the
abbe
in
her
frigid
little
salon
on
the
ground
floor
having
finished
the
recital
of
her
troubles
to
the
good
priest
her
only
friend
she
held
in
her
hand
some
letters
which
he
had
just
returned
to
her
after
reading
them
these
letters
had
brought
her
troubles
to
a
climax
seated
on
her
sofa
beside
a
square
table
covered
with
the
remains
of
a
dessert
the
old
lady
was
looking
at
the
abbe
who
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
doubled
up
in
his
armchair
and
stroking
his
chin
with
the
gesture
common
to
valets
on
the
stage
mathematicians
and
priests
a
sign
of
profound
meditation
on
a
problem
that
was
difficult
to
solve
this
little
salon
lighted
by
two
windows
on
the
street
and
finished
with
a
wainscot
painted
gray
was
so
damp
that
the
lower
panels
showed
the
geometrical
cracks
of
rotten
wood
when
the
paint
no
longer
binds
it
the
floor
polished
by
the
old
lady
s
one
servant
required
for
comfort
s
sake
before
each
seat
small
round
mats
of
brown
straw
on
one
of
which
the
abbe
was
now
resting
his
feet
the
old
damask
curtains
of
light
green
with
green
flowers
were
drawn
and
the
outside
blinds
had
been
closed
two
wax
candles
lighted
the
table
leaving
the
rest
of
the
room
in
is
it
necessary
to
say
that
between
the
two
windows
was
a
fine
pastel
by
latour
representing
the
famous
admiral
de
portenduere
the
rival
of
the
suffren
guichen
kergarouet
and
simeuse
naval
heroes
on
the
paneled
wall
opposite
to
the
fireplace
were
portraits
of
the
vicomte
de
portenduere
and
of
the
mother
of
the
old
lady
a
savinien

was
therefore
the
de
kergarouet
and
his
cousin
was
the
comte
de
portenduere
grandson
of
the
admiral
both
of
them
very
rich
the
de
kergarouet
lived
in
paris
and
the
comte
de
portenduere
at
the
chateau
of
that
name
in
dauphine
the
count
represented
the
elder
branch
and
savinien
was
the
only
scion
of
the
younger
the
count
who
was
over
forty
years
of
age
and
married
to
a
rich
wife
had
three
children
his
fortune
increased
by
various
legacies
amounted
it
was
said
to
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
as
deputy
from
isere
he
passed
his
winters
in
paris
where
he
had
bought
the
hotel
de
portenduere
with
the
indemnities
he
obtained
under
the
villele
law
the
had
recently
married
his
niece
by
marriage
for
the
sole
purpose
of
securing
his
money
to
her
the
faults
of
the
young
viscount
were
therefore
likely
to
cost
him
the
favor
of
two
powerful
protectors
if
savinien
had
entered
the
navy
young
and
handsome
as
he
was
with
a
famous
name
and
backed
by
the
influence
of
an
admiral
and
a
deputy
he
might
at
years
of
age
been
a
lieutenant
but
his
mother
unwilling
that
her
only
son
should
go
into
either
naval
or
military
service
had
kept
him
at
nemours
under
the
tutelage
of
one
of
the
abbe
chaperon
s
assistants
hoping
that
she
could
keep
him
near
her
until
her
death
she
meant
to
marry
him
to
a
demoiselle
d
aiglemont
with
a
fortune
of
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
to
whose
hand
the
name
of
portenduere
and
the
farm
at
bordieres
enabled
him
to
pretend
this
narrow
but
judicious
plan
which
would
have
carried
the
family
to
a
second
generation
was
already
balked
by
events
the
d
aiglemonts
were
ruined
and
one
of
the
daughters
helene
had
disappeared
and
the
mystery
of
her
disappearance
was
never
solved
the
weariness
of
a
life
without
atmosphere
without
prospects
without
action
without
other
nourishment
than
the
love
of
a
son
for
his
mother
so
worked
upon
savinien
that
he
burst
his
chains
gentle
as
they
were
and
swore
that
he
would
never
live
in
the
provinces
comprehending
rather
late
that
his
future
fate
was
not
to
be
in
the
rue
des
bourgeois
at
years
of
age
he
left
his
mother
s
house
to
make
acquaintance
with
his
relations
and
try
his
luck
in
paris
the
contrast
between
life
in
paris
and
life
in
nemours
was
likely
to
be
fatal
to
a
young
man
of
free
with
no
one
to
say
him
nay
naturally
eager
for
pleasure
and
for
whom
his
name
and
his
connections
opened
the
doors
of
all
the
salons
quite
convinced
that
his
mother
had
the
savings
of
many
years
in
her
savinien
soon
spent
the
six
thousand
francs
which
she
had
given
him
to
see
paris
that
sum
did
not
defray
his
expenses
for
six
months
and
he
soon
owed
double
that
sum
to
his
hotel
his
tailor
his
boot
maker
to
the
man
from
whom
he
hired
his
carriages
and
horses
to
a
jeweler
in
short
to
all
those
traders
and
shopkeepers
who
contribute
to
the
luxury
of
young
men
he
had
only
just
succeeded
in
making
himself
known
and
had
scarcely
learned
how
to
converse
how
to
present
himself
in
a
salon
how
to
wear
his
waistcoats
and
choose
them
and
to
order
his
coats
and
tie
his
cravat
before
he
found
himself
in
debt
for
over
thirty
thousand
francs
while
still
seeking
the
right
phrases
in
which
to
declare
his
love
for
the
sister
of
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
the
elegant
madame
de
serizy
whose
youth
had
been
at
its
climax
during
the
empire
how
is
that
you
all
manage
asked
savinien
one
day
at
the
end
of
a
gay
breakfast
with
a
knot
of
young
dandies
with
whom
he
was
intimate
as
the
young
men
of
the
present
day
are
intimate
with
each
other
all
aiming
for
the
same
thing
and
all
claiming
an
impossible
equality
you
were
no
richer
than
i
and
yet
you
get
along
without
anxiety
you
contrive
to
maintain
yourselves
while
as
for
me
i
make
nothing
but
we
all
began
that
way
answered
rastignac
laughing
and
the
laugh
was
echoed
by
lucien
de
rubempre
maxime
de
trailles
emile
blondet
and
others
of
the
fashionable
young
men
of
the
day
though
de
marsay
was
rich
when
he
started
in
life
he
was
an
exception
said
the
host
a
parvenu
named
finot
ambitious
of
seeming
intimate
with
these
young
men
any
one
but
he
added
finot
bowing
to
that
personage
would
have
been
ruined
by
a
true
remark
said
maxime
de
trailles
and
a
true
idea
added
rastignac
my
dear
fellow
said
de
marsay
gravely
to
savinien
debts
are
the
capital
stock
of
experience
a
good
university
education
with
tutors
for
all
branches
who
don
t
teach
you
anything
costs
sixty
thousand
francs
if
the
education
of
the
world
does
cost
double
at
least
it
teaches
you
to
understand
life
politics
men
and
sometimes
blondet
concluded
the
lesson
by
a
paraphrase
from
la
fontaine
the
world
sells
dearly
what
we
think
it
instead
of
laying
to
heart
the
sensible
advice
which
the
cleverest
pilots
of
the
parisian
archipelago
gave
him
savinien
took
it
all
as
a
joke
take
care
my
dear
fellow
said
de
marsay
one
day
you
have
a
great
name
if
you
don
t
obtain
the
fortune
that
name
requires
you
ll
end
your
days
in
the
uniform
of
a
we
have
seen
the
fall
of
nobler
heads
he
added
declaiming
the
line
of
corneille
as
he
took
savinien
s
arm
about
six
years
ago
he
continued
a
young
comte
d
esgrignon
came
among
us
but
he
did
not
stay
two
years
in
the
paradise
of
the
great
world
alas
he
lived
and
moved
like
a
rocket
he
rose
to
the
duchesse
de
maufrigneuse
and
fell
to
his
native
town
where
he
is
now
expiating
his
faults
with
a
wheezy
old
father
and
a
game
of
whist
at
two
sous
a
point
tell
madame
de
serizy
your
situation
candidly
without
shame
she
will
understand
it
and
be
very
useful
to
you
whereas
if
you
play
the
charade
of
first
love
with
her
she
will
pose
as
a
raffaelle
madonna
practice
all
the
little
games
of
innocence
upon
you
and
take
you
journeying
at
enormous
cost
through
the
land
of
savinien
still
too
young
and
too
pure
in
honor
dared
not
confess
his
position
as
to
money
to
madame
de
serizy
at
a
moment
when
he
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
he
had
written
his
mother
an
appealing
letter
to
which
she
replied
by
sending
him
the
sum
of
twenty
thousand
francs
which
was
all
she
possessed
this
assistance
brought
him
to
the
close
of
the
first
year
during
the
second
being
harnessed
to
the
chariot
of
madame
de
serizy
who
was
seriously
taken
with
him
and
who
was
as
the
saying
is
forming
him
he
had
recourse
to
the
dangerous
expedient
of
borrowing
one
of
his
friends
a
deputy
and
the
friend
of
his
cousin
the
comte
de
portenduere
advised
him
in
his
distress
to
go
to
gobseck
or
gigonnet
or
palma
who
if
duly
informed
as
to
his
mother
s
means
would
give
him
an
easy
discount
usury
and
the
deceptive
help
of
renewals
enabled
him
to
lead
a
happy
life
for
nearly
eighteen
months
without
daring
to
leave
madame
de
serizy
the
poor
boy
had
fallen
madly
in
love
with
the
beautiful
comtesse
de
kergarouet
a
prude
after
the
fashion
of
young
women
who
are
awaiting
the
death
of
an
old
husband
and
making
capital
of
their
virtue
in
the
interests
of
a
second
marriage
quite
incapable
of
understanding
that
calculating
virtue
is
invulnerable
savinien
paid
court
to
emilie
de
kergarouet
in
all
the
splendor
of
a
rich
man
he
never
missed
either
ball
or
theater
at
which
she
was
present
you
haven
t
powder
enough
my
boy
to
blow
up
that
rock
said
de
marsay
laughing
that
young
king
of
fashion
who
did
out
of
commiseration
for
the
lad
endeavor
to
explain
to
him
the
nature
of
emilie
de
fontaine
merely
wasted
his
words
the
gloomy
lights
of
misfortune
and
the
twilight
of
a
prison
were
needed
to
convince
savinien
a
note
imprudently
given
to
a
jeweler
in
collusion
with
the
who
did
not
wish
to
have
the
odium
of
arresting
the
young
man
was
the
means
of
sending
savinien
de
portenduere
in
default
of
one
hundred
and
seventeen
thousand
francs
and
without
the
knowledge
of
his
friends
to
the
debtor
s
prison
at
so
soon
as
the
fact
was
known
rastignac
de
marsay
and
lucien
de
rubempre
went
to
see
him
and
each
offered
him
a
banknote
of
a
thousand
francs
when
they
found
how
really
destitute
he
was
everything
belonging
to
him
had
been
seized
except
the
clothes
and
the
few
jewels
he
wore
the
three
young
men
who
brought
an
excellent
dinner
with
them
discussed
savinien
s
situation
while
drinking
de
marsay
s
wine
ostensibly
to
arrange
for
his
future
but
really
no
doubt
to
judge
of
him
when
a
man
is
named
savinien
de
portenduere
cried
rastignac
and
has
a
future
peer
of
france
for
a
cousin
and
admiral
kergarouet
for
a
and
commits
the
enormous
blunder
of
allowing
himself
to
be
put
in
it
is
very
certain
that
he
must
not
stay
there
my
good
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
cried
de
marsay
you
could
have
had
my
ten
thousand
francs
and
letters
of
introduction
for
germany
we
know
gobseck
and
gigonnet
and
the
other
crocodiles
we
could
have
made
them
capitulate
but
tell
me
in
the
first
place
what
ass
ever
led
you
to
drink
of
that
cursed
des
the
three
young
men
looked
at
each
other
with
one
and
the
same
thought
and
suspicion
but
they
did
not
utter
it
explain
all
your
resources
show
us
your
hand
said
de
marsay
when
savinien
had
told
of
his
mother
and
her
ways
and
the
little
house
with
three
windows
in
the
rue
des
bourgeois
without
other
grounds
than
a
court
for
the
well
and
a
shed
for
the
wood
when
he
had
valued
the
house
built
of
sandstone
and
pointed
in
reddish
cement
and
put
a
price
on
the
farm
at
bordieres
the
three
dandies
looked
at
each
other
and
all
three
said
with
a
solemn
air
the
word
of
the
abbe
in
alfred
de
musset
s
marrons
du
feu
which
had
then
just
appeared
sad
your
mother
will
pay
if
you
write
a
clever
letter
said
rastignac
yes
but
afterwards
cried
de
marsay
if
you
had
merely
been
put
in
the
fiacre
said
lucien
the
government
would
find
you
a
place
in
diplomacy
but
isn
t
the
antechamber
of
an
you
are
not
strong
enough
for
parisian
life
said
rastignac
let
us
consider
the
matter
said
de
marsay
looking
savinien
over
as
a
jockey
examines
a
horse
you
have
fine
blue
eyes
well
opened
a
white
forehead
well
shaped
magnificent
black
hair
a
little
moustache
which
suits
those
pale
cheeks
and
a
slim
figure
you
ve
a
foot
that
tells
race
shoulders
and
chest
not
quite
those
of
a
porter
but
solid
you
are
what
i
call
an
elegant
male
brunette
your
face
is
of
the
style
louis
hardly
any
color
nose
and
you
have
the
thing
that
pleases
women
a
something
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
which
men
take
no
account
of
themselves
it
is
in
the
air
the
manner
the
tone
of
the
voice
the
dart
of
the
eye
the
gesture
in
short
in
a
number
of
little
things
which
women
see
and
to
which
they
attach
a
meaning
which
escapes
us
you
don
t
know
your
merits
my
dear
fellow
take
a
certain
tone
and
style
and
in
six
months
you
ll
captivate
an
with
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
but
you
must
call
yourself
viscount
a
title
which
belongs
to
you
my
charming
lady
dudley
who
has
not
her
equal
for
matching
two
hearts
will
find
you
some
such
woman
in
the
fens
of
great
britain
what
you
must
now
do
is
to
get
the
payment
of
your
debts
postponed
for
ninety
days
why
didn
t
you
tell
us
about
them
the
at
baden
would
have
spared
you
served
you
perhaps
but
now
after
you
have
once
been
in
prison
they
ll
despise
you
a
is
like
society
like
the
masses
down
on
his
knees
before
the
man
who
is
strong
enough
to
trick
him
and
pitiless
to
the
lambs
to
the
eyes
of
some
persons
is
a
who
burns
the
souls
of
young
men
do
you
want
my
candid
advice
i
shall
tell
you
as
i
told
that
little
d
esgrignon
arrange
to
pay
your
debts
leisurely
keep
enough
to
live
on
for
three
years
and
marry
some
girl
in
the
provinces
who
can
bring
you
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
in
the
course
of
three
years
you
can
surely
find
some
virtuous
heiress
who
is
willing
to
call
herself
madame
la
vicomtesse
de
portenduere
such
is
virtue
let
s
drink
to
it
i
give
you
a
toast
the
girl
with
money
the
young
men
did
not
leave
their
till
the
official
hour
for
parting
the
gate
was
no
sooner
closed
behind
them
than
they
said
to
each
other
he
s
not
strong
enough
he
s
quite
i
don
t
believe
he
ll
pull
through
it
the
next
day
savinien
wrote
his
mother
a
confession
in
pages
madame
de
portenduere
after
weeping
for
one
whole
day
wrote
first
to
her
son
promising
to
get
him
out
of
prison
and
then
to
the
comte
de
portenduere
and
to
admiral
kergarouet
the
letters
the
abbe
had
just
read
and
which
the
poor
mother
was
holding
in
her
hand
and
moistening
with
tears
were
the
answers
to
her
appeal
which
had
arrived
that
morning
and
had
almost
broken
her
heart
paris
september
to
madame
de
portenduere
madame
you
can
not
doubt
the
interest
which
the
admiral
and
i
both
feel
in
your
troubles
what
you
ask
of
monsieur
de
kergarouet
grieves
me
all
the
more
because
our
house
was
a
home
to
your
son
we
were
proud
of
him
if
savinien
had
had
more
confidence
in
the
admiral
we
could
have
taken
him
to
live
with
us
and
he
would
already
have
obtained
some
good
situation
but
unfortunately
he
told
us
nothing
he
ran
into
debt
of
his
own
accord
and
even
involved
himself
for
me
who
knew
nothing
of
his
pecuniary
position
it
is
all
the
more
to
be
regretted
because
savinien
has
for
the
moment
tied
our
hands
by
allowing
the
authorities
to
arrest
him
if
my
nephew
had
not
shown
a
foolish
passion
for
me
and
sacrificed
our
relationship
to
the
vanity
of
a
lover
we
could
have
sent
him
to
travel
in
germany
while
his
affairs
were
being
settled
here
monsieur
de
kergarouet
intended
to
get
him
a
place
in
the
war
office
but
this
imprisonment
for
debt
will
paralyze
such
efforts
you
must
pay
his
debts
let
him
enter
the
navy
he
will
make
his
way
like
the
true
portenduere
that
he
is
he
has
the
fire
of
the
family
in
his
beautiful
black
eyes
and
we
will
all
help
him
do
not
be
disheartened
madame
you
have
many
friends
among
whom
i
beg
you
to
consider
me
as
one
of
the
most
sincere
i
send
you
our
best
wishes
with
the
respects
of
your
very
affectionate
servant
emilie
de
kergarouet
the
second
letter
was
as
follows
portenduere
august
to
madame
de
portenduere
my
dear
aunt
i
am
more
annoyed
than
surprised
at
savinien
s
pranks
as
i
am
married
and
the
father
of
two
sons
and
one
daughter
my
fortune
already
too
small
for
my
position
and
prospects
can
not
be
lessened
to
ransom
a
portenduere
from
the
hands
of
the
jews
sell
your
farm
pay
his
debts
and
come
and
live
with
us
at
portenduere
you
shall
receive
the
welcome
we
owe
you
even
though
our
views
may
not
be
entirely
in
accordance
with
yours
you
shall
be
made
happy
and
we
will
manage
to
marry
savinien
whom
my
wife
thinks
charming
this
little
outbreak
is
nothing
do
not
make
yourself
unhappy
it
will
never
be
known
in
this
part
of
the
country
where
there
are
a
number
of
rich
girls
who
would
be
delighted
to
enter
our
family
my
wife
joins
me
in
assuring
you
of
the
happiness
you
would
give
us
and
i
beg
you
to
accept
her
wishes
for
the
realization
of
this
plan
together
with
my
affectionate
respects
comte
de
portenduere
what
letters
for
a
kergarouet
to
receive
cried
the
old
breton
lady
wiping
her
eyes
the
admiral
does
not
know
his
nephew
is
in
prison
said
the
abbe
chaperon
at
last
the
countess
alone
read
your
letter
and
has
answered
it
for
him
but
you
must
decide
at
once
on
some
course
he
added
after
a
pause
and
this
is
what
i
have
the
honor
to
advise
do
not
sell
your
farm
the
lease
is
just
out
having
lasted
years
in
a
few
months
you
can
raise
the
rent
to
six
thousand
francs
and
get
a
premium
for
double
that
amount
borrow
what
you
need
of
some
honest
man
not
from
the
townspeople
who
make
a
business
of
mortgages
your
neighbour
here
is
a
most
worthy
man
a
man
of
good
society
who
knew
it
as
it
was
before
the
revolution
who
was
once
an
atheist
and
is
now
an
earnest
catholic
do
not
let
your
feelings
debar
you
from
going
to
his
house
this
very
evening
he
will
fully
understand
the
step
you
take
forget
for
a
moment
that
you
are
a
never
said
the
old
mother
in
a
sharp
voice
well
then
be
an
amiable
kergarouet
come
when
he
is
alone
he
will
lend
you
the
money
at
three
and
a
half
per
cent
perhaps
even
at
three
per
cent
and
will
do
you
this
service
delicately
you
will
be
pleased
with
him
he
can
go
to
paris
and
release
savinien
himself
for
he
will
have
to
go
there
to
sell
out
his
funds
and
he
can
bring
the
lad
back
to
are
you
speaking
of
that
little
minoret
that
little
minoret
is
years
old
said
the
abbe
smiling
my
dear
lady
do
have
a
little
christian
charity
don
t
wound
him
he
might
be
useful
to
you
in
other
what
ways
he
has
an
angel
in
his
house
a
precious
young
girl
oh
that
little
ursula
what
of
that
the
poor
abbe
did
not
pursue
the
subject
after
these
significant
words
the
laconic
sharpness
of
which
cut
through
the
proposition
he
was
about
to
make
i
think
doctor
minoret
is
very
rich
he
said
so
much
the
better
for
you
have
indirectly
caused
your
son
s
misfortunes
by
refusing
to
give
him
a
profession
beware
for
the
future
said
the
abbe
sternly
am
i
to
tell
doctor
minoret
that
you
are
coming
why
can
not
he
come
to
me
if
he
knows
i
want
him
she
replied
ah
madame
if
you
go
to
him
you
will
pay
him
three
per
cent
if
he
comes
to
you
you
will
pay
him
five
said
the
abbe
inventing
this
reason
to
influence
the
old
lady
and
if
you
are
forced
to
sell
your
farm
by
dionis
the
notary
or
by
massin
the
clerk
who
would
refuse
to
lend
you
the
money
knowing
it
was
more
their
interest
to
buy
you
would
lose
half
its
value
i
have
not
the
slightest
influence
on
the
dionis
massins
or
levraults
or
any
of
those
rich
men
who
covet
your
farm
and
know
that
your
son
is
in
they
know
it
oh
do
they
know
it
she
exclaimed
throwing
up
her
arms
there
my
poor
abbe
you
have
let
your
coffee
get
cold
tiennette
tiennette
tiennette
an
old
breton
servant
sixty
years
of
age
wearing
a
short
gown
and
a
breton
cap
came
quickly
in
and
took
the
abbe
s
coffee
to
warm
it
let
be
monsieur
le
recteur
she
said
seeing
that
the
abbe
meant
to
drink
it
i
ll
just
put
it
into
the
it
won
t
spoil
well
said
the
abbe
to
madame
de
portenduere
in
his
most
insinuating
voice
i
shall
go
and
tell
the
doctor
of
your
visit
and
you
will
come
the
old
mother
did
not
yield
till
after
an
hour
s
discussion
during
which
the
abbe
was
forced
to
repeat
his
arguments
at
least
ten
times
and
even
then
the
proud
kergarouet
was
not
vanquished
until
he
used
the
words
savinien
would
it
is
better
that
i
should
go
than
he
she
said
chapter
xi
savinien
saved
the
clock
was
striking
nine
when
the
little
door
made
in
the
large
door
of
madame
de
portenduere
s
house
closed
on
the
abbe
who
immediately
crossed
the
road
and
hastily
rang
the
bell
at
the
doctor
s
gate
he
fell
from
tiennette
to
la
bougival
the
one
said
to
him
why
do
you
come
so
late
monsieur
l
abbe
as
the
other
had
said
why
do
you
leave
madame
so
early
when
she
is
in
trouble
the
abbe
found
a
numerous
company
assembled
in
the
green
and
brown
salon
for
dionis
had
stopped
at
massin
s
on
his
way
home
to
the
heirs
by
repeating
their
uncle
s
words
i
believe
ursula
has
a
said
he
which
will
be
nothing
but
pain
and
trouble
to
her
she
seems
romantic
extreme
sensibility
is
so
called
by
notaries
and
you
ll
see
she
won
t
marry
soon
therefore
don
t
show
her
any
distrust
be
very
attentive
to
her
and
very
respectful
to
your
uncle
for
he
is
slyer
than
fifty
goupils
added
the
notary
without
being
aware
that
goupil
is
a
corruption
of
the
word
vulpes
a
fox
so
mesdames
massin
and
cremiere
with
their
husbands
the
post
master
and
desire
together
with
the
nemours
doctor
and
bongrand
made
an
unusual
and
noisy
party
in
the
doctor
s
salon
as
the
abbe
entered
he
heard
the
sound
of
the
piano
poor
ursula
was
just
finishing
a
sonata
of
beethoven
s
with
girlish
mischief
she
had
chosen
that
grand
music
which
must
be
studied
to
be
understood
for
the
purpose
of
disgusting
these
women
with
the
thing
they
coveted
the
finer
the
music
the
less
ignorant
persons
like
it
so
when
the
door
opened
and
the
abbe
s
venerable
head
appeared
they
all
cried
out
ah
here
s
monsieur
l
abbe
in
a
tone
of
relief
delighted
to
jump
up
and
put
an
end
to
their
torture
the
exclamation
was
echoed
at
the
where
bongrand
the
nemours
doctor
and
old
minoret
were
victims
to
the
presumption
with
which
the
collector
in
order
to
propitiate
his
had
proposed
to
take
the
fourth
hand
at
whist
ursula
left
the
piano
the
doctor
rose
as
if
to
receive
the
abbe
but
really
to
put
an
end
to
the
game
after
many
compliments
to
their
uncle
on
the
wonderful
proficiency
of
his
goddaughter
the
heirs
made
their
bow
and
retired
my
friends
cried
the
doctor
as
the
iron
gate
clanged
ah
that
s
where
the
money
goes
said
madame
cremiere
to
madame
massin
as
they
walked
on
god
forbid
that
i
should
spend
money
to
teach
my
little
aline
to
make
such
a
din
as
that
cried
madame
massin
she
said
it
was
beethoven
who
is
thought
to
be
fine
musician
said
the
collector
he
has
quite
a
not
in
nemours
i
m
sure
of
that
said
madame
cremiere
i
believe
uncle
made
her
play
it
expressly
to
drive
us
away
said
massin
for
i
saw
him
give
that
little
minx
a
wink
as
she
opened
the
if
that
s
the
sort
of
charivari
they
like
said
the
post
master
they
are
quite
right
to
keep
it
to
monsieur
bongrand
must
be
fond
of
whist
to
stand
such
a
dreadful
racket
said
madame
cremiere
i
shall
never
be
able
to
play
before
persons
who
don
t
understand
music
ursula
was
saying
as
she
sat
down
beside
the
in
natures
richly
organized
said
the
abbe
sentiments
can
be
developed
only
in
a
congenial
atmosphere
just
as
a
priest
is
unable
to
give
the
blessing
in
presence
of
an
evil
spirit
or
as
a
dies
in
a
clay
soil
so
a
musician
s
genius
has
a
mental
eclipse
when
he
is
surrounded
by
ignorant
persons
in
all
the
arts
we
must
receive
from
the
souls
who
make
the
environment
of
our
souls
as
much
intensity
as
we
convey
to
them
this
axiom
which
rules
the
human
mind
has
been
made
into
proverbs
howl
with
the
wolves
like
meets
but
the
suffering
you
felt
ursula
affects
delicate
and
tender
natures
and
so
friends
said
the
doctor
a
thing
which
would
merely
give
pain
to
most
women
might
kill
my
ursula
ah
when
i
am
no
longer
here
i
charge
you
to
see
that
the
hedge
of
which
catullus
spoke
ut
flos
a
protecting
hedge
is
raised
between
this
cherished
flower
and
the
and
yet
those
ladies
flattered
you
ursula
said
monsieur
bongrand
smiling
flattered
her
grossly
remarked
the
nemours
doctor
i
have
always
noticed
how
vulgar
forced
flattery
is
said
old
minoret
why
is
that
a
true
thought
has
its
own
delicacy
said
the
abbe
did
you
dine
with
madame
de
portenduere
asked
ursula
with
a
look
of
anxious
curiosity
yes
the
poor
lady
is
terribly
distressed
it
is
possible
she
may
come
to
see
you
this
evening
monsieur
ursula
pressed
her
godfather
s
hand
under
the
table
her
son
said
bongrand
was
rather
too
to
live
in
paris
without
a
mentor
when
i
heard
that
inquiries
were
being
made
here
about
the
property
of
the
old
lady
i
feared
he
was
discounting
her
is
it
possible
you
think
him
capable
of
it
said
ursula
with
such
a
terrible
glance
at
monsieur
bongrand
that
he
said
to
himself
rather
sadly
alas
yes
she
loves
yes
and
no
said
the
nemours
doctor
replying
to
ursula
s
question
there
is
a
great
deal
of
good
in
savinien
and
that
is
why
he
is
now
in
prison
a
scamp
wouldn
t
have
got
don
t
let
us
talk
about
it
any
more
said
old
minoret
the
poor
mother
must
not
be
allowed
to
weep
if
there
s
a
way
to
dry
her
the
four
friends
rose
and
went
out
ursula
accompanied
them
to
the
gate
saw
her
godfather
and
the
abbe
knock
at
the
opposite
door
and
as
soon
as
tiennette
admitted
them
she
sat
down
on
the
outer
wall
with
la
bougival
beside
her
madame
la
vicomtesse
said
the
abbe
who
entered
first
into
the
little
salon
monsieur
le
docteur
minoret
was
not
willing
that
you
should
have
the
trouble
of
coming
to
him
i
am
too
much
of
the
old
school
madame
interrupted
the
doctor
not
to
know
what
a
man
owes
to
a
woman
of
your
rank
and
i
am
very
glad
to
be
able
as
monsieur
l
abbe
tells
me
to
be
of
service
to
madame
de
portenduere
who
disliked
the
step
the
abbe
had
advised
so
much
that
she
had
almost
decided
after
he
left
her
to
apply
to
the
notary
instead
was
surprised
by
minoret
s
attention
to
such
a
degree
that
she
rose
to
receive
him
and
signed
to
him
to
take
a
chair
be
seated
monsieur
she
said
with
a
regal
air
our
dear
abbe
has
told
you
that
the
viscount
is
in
prison
on
account
of
some
youthful
debts
a
hundred
thousand
francs
or
so
if
you
could
lend
them
to
him
i
would
secure
you
on
my
farm
at
we
will
talk
of
that
madame
when
i
have
brought
your
son
back
to
you
if
you
will
allow
me
to
be
your
emissary
in
the
very
good
monsieur
she
said
bowing
her
head
and
looking
at
the
abbe
as
if
to
say
you
were
right
he
really
is
a
man
of
good
you
see
madame
said
the
abbe
that
my
friend
the
doctor
is
full
of
devotion
to
your
we
shall
be
grateful
monsieur
said
madame
de
portenduere
making
a
visible
effort
a
journey
to
paris
at
your
age
in
quest
of
a
prodigal
is
madame
i
had
the
honor
to
meet
in
the
illustrious
admiral
de
portenduere
in
the
house
of
that
excellent
monsieur
de
malesherbes
and
also
in
that
of
monsieur
le
comte
de
buffon
who
was
anxious
to
question
him
on
some
curious
results
of
his
voyages
possibly
monsieur
de
portenduere
your
late
husband
was
present
those
were
the
glorious
days
of
the
french
navy
it
bore
comparison
with
that
of
great
britain
and
its
officers
had
their
full
quota
of
courage
with
what
impatience
we
awaited
in
and
the
news
from
roch
i
came
very
near
serving
as
surgeon
in
the
king
s
service
your
who
is
still
living
admiral
kergarouet
fought
his
splendid
battle
at
that
time
in
the
ah
if
he
did
but
know
his
is
in
prison
he
would
not
leave
him
there
a
day
said
old
minoret
rising
he
held
out
his
hand
to
take
that
of
the
old
lady
which
she
allowed
him
to
do
then
he
kissed
it
respectfully
bowed
profoundly
and
left
the
room
but
returned
immediately
to
say
my
dear
abbe
may
i
ask
you
to
engage
a
place
in
the
diligence
for
me
the
abbe
stayed
behind
for
half
an
hour
to
sing
the
praises
of
his
friend
who
meant
to
win
and
had
succeeded
in
winning
the
good
graces
of
the
old
lady
he
is
an
astonishing
man
for
his
age
she
said
he
talks
of
going
to
paris
and
attending
to
my
son
s
affairs
as
if
he
were
only
he
has
certainly
seen
good
the
very
best
madame
and
more
than
one
son
of
a
peer
of
france
would
be
glad
to
marry
his
goddaughter
with
a
million
ah
if
that
idea
should
come
into
savinien
s
head
times
are
so
changed
that
the
objections
would
not
come
from
your
side
especially
after
his
late
conduct
the
amazement
into
which
the
speech
threw
the
old
lady
alone
enabled
him
to
finish
it
you
have
lost
your
senses
she
said
at
last
think
it
over
madame
god
grant
that
your
son
may
conduct
himself
in
future
in
a
manner
to
win
that
old
man
s
if
it
were
not
you
monsieur
l
abbe
said
madame
de
portenduere
if
it
were
any
one
else
who
spoke
to
me
in
that
way
you
would
not
see
him
again
said
the
abbe
smiling
let
us
hope
that
your
dear
son
will
enlighten
you
as
to
what
occurs
in
paris
in
these
days
as
to
marriages
you
will
think
only
of
savinien
s
good
as
you
really
have
helped
to
compromise
his
future
you
will
not
stand
in
the
way
of
his
making
himself
another
and
it
is
you
who
say
that
to
me
if
i
did
not
say
it
to
you
who
would
cried
the
abbe
rising
and
making
a
hasty
retreat
as
he
left
the
house
he
saw
ursula
and
her
godfather
standing
in
their
courtyard
the
weak
doctor
had
been
so
entreated
by
ursula
that
he
had
just
yielded
to
her
she
wanted
to
go
with
him
to
paris
and
gave
a
thousand
reasons
he
called
to
the
abbe
and
begged
him
to
engage
the
whole
coupe
for
him
that
very
evening
if
the
were
still
open
the
next
day
at
six
o
clock
the
old
man
and
the
young
girl
reached
paris
and
the
doctor
went
at
once
to
consult
his
notary
political
events
were
then
very
threatening
monsieur
bongrand
had
remarked
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
evening
that
a
man
must
be
a
fool
to
keep
a
penny
in
the
public
funds
so
long
as
the
quarrel
between
the
press
and
the
court
was
not
made
up
minoret
s
notary
now
indirectly
approved
of
this
opinion
the
doctor
therefore
took
advantage
of
his
journey
to
sell
out
his
manufacturing
stocks
and
his
shares
in
the
funds
all
of
which
were
then
at
a
high
value
depositing
the
proceeds
in
the
bank
of
france
the
notary
also
advised
his
client
to
sell
the
stocks
left
to
ursula
by
monsieur
de
jordy
he
promised
to
employ
an
extremely
clever
broker
to
treat
with
savinien
s
creditors
but
said
that
in
order
to
succeed
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
young
man
to
stay
several
days
longer
in
prison
haste
in
such
matters
always
means
the
loss
of
at
least
fifteen
per
cent
said
the
notary
besides
you
can
t
get
your
money
under
seven
or
eight
when
ursula
heard
that
savinien
would
have
to
say
at
least
a
week
longer
in
jail
she
begged
her
godfather
to
let
her
go
there
if
only
once
old
minoret
refused
the
uncle
and
niece
were
staying
at
a
hotel
in
the
rue
croix
des
where
the
doctor
had
taken
a
very
suitable
apartment
knowing
the
scrupulous
honor
and
propriety
of
his
goddaughter
he
made
her
promise
not
to
go
out
while
he
was
away
at
other
times
he
took
her
to
see
the
arcades
the
shops
the
boulevards
but
nothing
seemed
to
amuse
or
interest
her
what
do
you
want
to
do
asked
the
old
man
see
she
answered
obstinately
minoret
called
a
and
took
her
to
the
rue
de
la
clef
where
the
carriage
drew
up
before
the
shabby
front
of
an
old
convent
then
transformed
into
a
prison
the
sight
of
those
high
gray
walls
with
every
window
barred
of
the
wicket
through
which
none
can
enter
without
stooping
horrible
lesson
of
the
whole
gloomy
structure
in
a
quarter
full
of
wretchedness
where
it
rises
amid
squalid
streets
like
a
supreme
misery
this
assemblage
of
dismal
things
so
oppressed
ursula
s
heart
that
she
burst
into
tears
oh
she
said
to
imprison
young
men
in
this
dreadful
place
for
money
how
can
a
debt
to
a
have
a
power
the
king
has
not
there
she
cried
where
godfather
she
added
looking
from
window
to
window
ursula
said
the
old
man
you
are
making
me
commit
great
follies
this
is
not
forgetting
him
as
you
but
she
argued
if
i
must
renounce
him
must
i
also
cease
to
feel
an
interest
in
him
i
can
love
him
and
not
marry
at
ah
cried
the
doctor
there
is
so
much
reason
in
your
unreasonableness
that
i
am
sorry
i
brought
three
days
later
the
worthy
man
had
all
the
receipts
signed
and
the
legal
papers
ready
for
savinien
s
release
the
payings
including
the
notaries
fees
amounted
to
eighty
thousand
francs
the
doctor
went
himself
to
see
savinien
released
on
saturday
at
two
o
clock
the
young
viscount
already
informed
of
what
had
happened
by
his
mother
thanked
his
liberator
with
sincere
warmth
of
heart
you
must
return
at
once
to
see
your
mother
the
old
doctor
said
to
him
savinien
answered
in
a
sort
of
confusion
that
he
had
contracted
certain
debts
of
honor
while
in
prison
and
related
the
visit
of
his
friends
i
suspected
there
was
some
personal
debt
cried
the
doctor
smiling
your
mother
borrowed
a
hundred
thousand
francs
of
me
but
i
have
paid
out
only
eighty
thousand
here
is
the
rest
be
careful
how
you
spend
it
monsieur
consider
what
you
have
left
of
it
as
your
stake
on
the
green
cloth
of
during
the
last
eight
days
savinien
had
made
many
reflections
on
the
present
conditions
of
life
competition
in
everything
necessitated
hard
work
on
the
part
of
whoever
sought
a
fortune
illegal
methods
and
underhand
dealing
demanded
more
talent
than
open
efforts
in
face
of
day
success
in
society
far
from
giving
a
man
position
wasted
his
time
and
required
an
immense
deal
of
money
the
name
of
portenduere
which
his
mother
considered
had
no
power
at
all
in
paris
his
cousin
the
deputy
comte
de
portenduere
cut
a
very
poor
figure
in
the
elective
chamber
in
presence
of
the
peerage
and
the
court
and
had
none
too
much
credit
personally
admiral
kergarouet
existed
only
as
the
husband
of
his
wife
savinien
admitted
to
himself
that
he
had
seen
orators
men
from
the
middle
classes
or
lesser
noblemen
become
influential
personages
money
was
the
pivot
the
sole
means
the
only
mechanism
of
a
society
which
louis
xviii
had
tried
to
create
in
the
likeness
of
that
of
england
on
his
way
from
the
rue
de
la
clef
to
the
rue
croix
des
the
young
gentleman
divulged
the
upshot
of
these
meditations
which
were
certainly
in
keeping
with
de
marsay
s
advice
to
the
old
doctor
i
ought
he
said
to
go
into
oblivion
for
three
or
four
years
and
seek
a
career
perhaps
i
could
make
myself
a
name
by
writing
a
book
on
statesmanship
or
morals
or
a
treatise
on
some
of
the
great
questions
of
the
day
while
i
am
looking
out
for
a
marriage
with
some
young
lady
who
could
make
me
eligible
to
the
chamber
i
will
work
hard
in
silence
and
in
studying
the
young
fellow
s
face
with
a
keen
eye
the
doctor
saw
the
serious
purpose
of
a
wounded
man
who
was
anxious
to
vindicate
himself
he
therefore
cordially
approved
of
the
scheme
my
friend
he
said
if
you
strip
off
the
skin
of
the
old
nobility
which
is
no
longer
worn
these
days
i
will
undertake
after
you
have
lived
for
three
or
four
years
in
a
steady
and
industrious
manner
to
find
you
a
superior
young
girl
beautiful
amiable
pious
and
possessing
from
seven
to
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
who
will
make
you
happy
and
of
whom
you
will
have
every
reason
to
be
proud
one
whose
only
nobility
is
that
of
the
heart
ah
doctor
cried
the
young
man
there
is
no
longer
a
nobility
in
these
days
nothing
but
an
go
and
pay
your
debts
of
honor
and
come
back
here
i
shall
engage
the
coupe
of
the
diligence
for
my
niece
is
with
me
said
the
old
man
that
evening
at
six
o
clock
the
three
travelers
started
from
the
rue
dauphine
ursula
had
put
on
a
veil
and
did
not
say
a
word
savinien
who
once
in
a
moment
of
superficial
gallantry
had
sent
her
that
kiss
which
invaded
and
conquered
her
soul
like
a
had
completely
forgotten
the
young
girl
in
the
hell
of
his
parisian
debts
moreover
his
hopeless
love
for
emilie
de
kergarouet
hindered
him
from
bestowing
a
thought
on
a
few
glances
exchanged
with
a
little
country
girl
he
did
not
recognize
her
when
the
doctor
handed
her
into
the
coach
and
then
sat
down
beside
her
to
separate
her
from
the
young
viscount
i
have
some
bills
to
give
you
said
the
doctor
to
the
young
man
i
have
brought
all
your
papers
and
i
came
very
near
not
getting
off
said
savinien
for
i
had
to
order
linen
and
clothes
the
philistines
took
all
i
return
like
a
true
however
interesting
were
the
subjects
of
conversation
between
the
young
man
and
the
old
one
and
however
witty
and
clever
were
certain
remarks
of
the
viscount
the
young
girl
continued
silent
till
after
dusk
her
green
veil
lowered
and
her
hands
crossed
on
her
shawl
mademoiselle
does
not
seem
to
have
enjoyed
paris
very
much
said
savinien
at
last
somewhat
piqued
i
am
glad
to
return
to
nemours
she
answered
in
a
trembling
voice
raising
her
veil
notwithstanding
the
dim
light
savinien
then
recognized
her
by
the
heavy
braids
of
her
hair
and
the
brilliancy
of
her
blue
eyes
i
too
leave
paris
to
bury
myself
in
nemours
without
regret
now
that
i
meet
my
charming
neighbour
again
he
said
i
hope
monsieur
le
docteur
that
you
will
receive
me
in
your
house
i
love
music
and
i
remember
to
have
listened
to
mademoiselle
ursula
s
i
do
not
know
replied
the
doctor
gravely
whether
your
mother
would
approve
of
your
visits
to
an
old
man
whose
duty
it
is
to
care
for
this
dear
child
with
all
the
solicitude
of
a
this
reserved
answer
made
savinien
reflect
and
he
then
remembered
the
kisses
so
thoughtlessly
wafted
night
came
the
heat
was
great
savinien
and
the
doctor
went
to
sleep
first
ursula
whose
head
was
full
of
projects
did
not
succumb
till
midnight
she
had
taken
off
her
and
her
head
covered
with
a
little
embroidered
cap
dropped
upon
her
uncle
s
shoulder
when
they
reached
bouron
at
dawn
savinien
awoke
he
then
saw
ursula
in
the
slight
disarray
naturally
caused
by
the
jolting
of
the
vehicle
her
cap
was
rumpled
and
half
off
the
hair
unbound
had
fallen
each
side
of
her
face
which
glowed
from
the
heat
of
the
night
in
this
situation
dreadful
for
women
to
whom
dress
is
a
necessary
auxiliary
youth
and
beauty
triumphed
the
sleep
of
innocence
is
always
lovely
the
lips
showed
the
pretty
teeth
the
shawl
unfastened
gave
to
view
beneath
the
folds
of
her
muslin
gown
and
without
offence
to
her
modesty
the
gracefulness
of
her
figure
the
purity
of
the
virgin
spirit
shone
on
the
sleeping
countenance
all
the
more
plainly
because
no
other
expression
was
there
to
interfere
with
it
old
minoret
who
presently
woke
up
placed
his
child
s
head
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
that
she
might
be
more
at
ease
and
she
let
him
do
it
unconsciously
so
deep
was
her
sleep
after
the
many
wakeful
nights
she
had
spent
in
thinking
of
savinien
s
trouble
poor
little
girl
said
the
doctor
to
his
neighbour
she
sleeps
like
the
child
she
you
must
be
proud
of
her
replied
savinien
for
she
seems
as
good
as
she
is
ah
she
is
the
joy
of
the
house
i
could
not
love
her
better
if
she
were
my
own
daughter
she
will
be
sixteen
on
the
february
god
grant
that
i
may
live
long
enough
to
marry
her
to
a
man
who
will
make
her
happy
i
wanted
to
take
her
to
the
theater
in
paris
where
she
was
for
the
first
time
but
she
refused
the
abbe
chaperon
had
forbidden
it
but
i
said
when
you
are
married
your
husband
will
want
you
to
go
i
shall
do
what
my
husband
wants
she
answered
if
he
asks
me
to
do
evil
and
i
am
weak
enough
to
yield
he
will
be
responsible
before
god
and
so
i
shall
have
strength
to
refuse
him
for
his
own
as
the
coach
entered
nemours
at
five
in
the
morning
ursula
woke
up
ashamed
at
her
rumpled
condition
and
confused
by
the
look
of
admiration
which
she
encountered
from
savinien
during
the
hour
it
had
taken
the
diligence
to
come
from
bouron
to
nemours
the
young
man
had
fallen
in
love
with
ursula
he
had
studied
the
pure
candor
of
her
soul
the
beauty
of
that
body
the
whiteness
of
the
skin
the
delicacy
of
the
features
he
recalled
the
charm
of
the
voice
which
had
uttered
but
one
expressive
sentence
in
which
the
poor
child
said
all
intending
to
say
nothing
a
presentiment
suddenly
seemed
to
take
hold
of
him
he
saw
in
ursula
the
woman
the
doctor
had
pictured
to
him
framed
in
gold
by
the
magic
words
seven
or
eight
hundred
thousand
in
three
of
four
years
she
will
be
twenty
and
i
shall
be
he
thought
the
good
doctor
talked
of
probation
work
good
conduct
sly
as
he
is
i
shall
make
him
tell
me
the
the
three
neighbours
parted
in
the
street
in
front
of
their
respective
homes
and
savinien
put
a
little
courting
into
his
eyes
as
he
gave
ursula
a
parting
glance
madame
de
portenduere
let
her
son
sleep
till
midday
but
the
doctor
and
ursula
in
spite
of
their
fatiguing
journey
went
to
high
mass
savinien
s
release
and
his
return
in
company
with
the
doctor
had
explained
the
reason
of
the
latter
s
absence
to
the
newsmongers
of
the
town
and
to
the
heirs
who
were
once
more
assembled
in
conventicle
on
the
square
just
as
they
were
two
weeks
earlier
when
the
doctor
attended
his
first
mass
to
the
great
astonishment
of
all
the
groups
madame
de
portenduere
on
leaving
the
church
stopped
old
minoret
who
offered
her
his
arm
and
took
her
home
the
old
lady
asked
him
to
dinner
that
evening
also
asking
his
niece
and
assuring
him
that
the
abbe
would
be
the
only
other
guest
he
must
have
wished
ursula
to
see
paris
said
pest
cried
cremiere
he
can
t
take
a
step
without
that
girl
something
must
have
happened
to
make
old
portenduere
accept
his
arm
said
massin
so
none
of
you
have
guessed
that
your
uncle
has
sold
his
funds
and
released
that
little
savinien
cried
goupil
he
refused
dionis
but
he
didn
t
refuse
madame
de
portenduere
ha
ha
you
are
all
done
for
the
viscount
will
propose
a
instead
of
a
mortgage
and
the
doctor
will
make
the
husband
settle
on
his
jewel
of
a
girl
the
sum
he
has
now
paid
to
secure
the
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
to
marry
ursula
to
savinien
said
the
butcher
the
old
lady
gives
a
dinner
to
monsieur
minoret
tiennette
came
early
for
a
well
dionis
here
s
a
fine
said
massin
rushing
up
to
the
notary
who
was
entering
the
square
what
is
it
s
all
going
right
returned
the
notary
your
uncle
has
sold
his
funds
and
madame
de
portenduere
has
sent
for
me
to
witness
the
signing
of
a
mortgage
on
her
property
for
one
hundred
thousand
francs
lent
to
her
by
your
yes
but
suppose
the
young
people
should
marry
that
s
as
if
you
said
goupil
was
to
be
my
the
two
things
are
not
so
impossible
said
goupil
on
returning
from
mass
madame
de
portenduere
told
tiennette
to
inform
her
son
that
she
wished
to
see
him
the
little
house
had
three
bedrooms
on
the
first
floor
that
of
madame
de
portenduere
and
that
of
her
late
husband
were
separated
by
a
large
lighted
by
a
skylight
and
connected
by
a
little
antechamber
which
opened
on
the
staircase
the
window
of
the
other
room
occupied
by
savinien
looked
like
that
of
his
late
father
on
the
street
the
staircase
went
up
at
the
back
of
the
house
leaving
room
for
a
little
study
lighted
by
a
small
round
window
opening
on
the
court
madame
de
portenduere
s
bedroom
the
gloomiest
in
the
house
also
looked
into
the
court
but
the
widow
spent
all
her
time
in
the
salon
on
the
ground
floor
which
communicated
by
a
passage
with
the
kitchen
built
at
the
end
of
the
court
so
that
this
salon
was
made
to
answer
the
double
purpose
of
and
combined
the
bedroom
of
the
late
monsieur
de
portenduere
remained
as
he
had
left
it
on
the
day
of
his
death
there
was
no
change
except
that
he
was
absent
madame
de
portenduere
had
made
the
bed
herself
laying
upon
it
the
uniform
of
a
naval
captain
his
sword
cordon
orders
and
hat
the
gold
from
which
her
late
husband
had
taken
snuff
for
the
last
time
was
on
the
table
with
his
his
watch
and
the
cup
from
which
he
drank
his
white
hair
arranged
in
one
curled
lock
and
framed
hung
above
a
crucifix
and
the
holy
water
in
the
alcove
all
the
little
ornaments
he
had
worn
his
journals
his
furniture
his
dutch
spittoon
his
hanging
by
the
mantel
were
all
there
the
widow
had
stopped
the
hands
of
the
clock
at
the
hour
of
his
death
to
which
they
always
pointed
the
room
still
smelt
of
the
powder
and
the
tobacco
of
the
deceased
the
hearth
was
as
he
left
it
to
her
entering
there
he
was
again
visible
in
the
many
articles
which
told
of
his
daily
habits
his
tall
cane
with
its
gold
head
was
where
he
had
last
placed
it
with
his
buckskin
gloves
close
by
on
a
table
against
the
wall
stood
a
gold
vase
of
coarse
workmanship
but
worth
three
thousand
francs
a
gift
from
havana
which
city
at
the
time
of
the
american
war
of
independence
he
had
protected
from
an
attack
by
the
british
bringing
his
convoy
safe
into
port
after
an
engagement
with
superior
forces
to

this
service
the
king
of
spain
had
made
him
a
knight
of
his
order
the
same
event
gave
him
a
right
to
the
next
promotion
to
the
rank
of
and
he
also
received
the
red
ribbing
he
then
married
his
wife
who
had
a
fortune
of
about
two
hundred
thousand
francs
but
the
revolution
hindered
his
promotion
and
monsieur
de
portenduere
emigrated
where
is
my
mother
said
savinien
to
tiennette
she
is
waiting
for
you
in
your
father
s
room
said
the
old
breton
woman
savinien
could
not
repress
a
shudder
he
knew
his
mother
s
rigid
principles
her
worship
of
honor
her
loyalty
her
faith
in
nobility
and
he
foresaw
a
scene
he
went
up
to
the
assault
with
his
heart
beating
and
his
face
rather
pale
in
the
dim
light
which
filtered
through
the
blinds
he
saw
his
mother
dressed
in
black
and
with
an
air
of
solemnity
in
keeping
with
that
funereal
room
monsieur
le
vicomte
she
said
when
she
saw
him
rising
and
taking
his
hand
to
lead
him
to
his
father
s
bed
there
died
your
father
a
man
of
honor
he
died
without
reproach
from
his
own
conscience
his
spirit
is
there
surely
he
groaned
in
heaven
when
he
saw
his
son
degraded
by
imprisonment
for
debt
under
the
old
monarchy
that
stain
could
have
been
spared
you
by
obtaining
a
lettre
de
cachet
and
shutting
you
up
for
a
few
days
in
a
military
but
you
are
here
you
stand
before
your
father
who
hears
you
you
know
all
that
you
did
before
you
were
sent
to
that
ignoble
prison
will
you
swear
to
me
before
your
father
s
shade
and
in
presence
of
god
who
sees
all
that
you
have
done
no
dishonorable
act
that
your
debts
are
the
result
of
youthful
folly
and
that
your
honor
is
untarnished
if
your
blameless
father
were
there
sitting
in
that
armchair
and
asking
an
explanation
of
your
conduct
could
he
embrace
you
after
having
heard
it
yes
mother
replied
the
young
man
with
grave
respect
she
opened
her
arms
and
pressed
him
to
her
heart
shedding
a
few
tears
let
us
forget
it
all
my
son
she
said
it
is
only
a
little
less
money
i
shall
pray
god
to
let
us
recover
it
as
you
are
indeed
worthy
of
your
name
kiss
me
for
i
have
suffered
i
swear
mother
he
said
laying
his
hand
upon
the
bed
to
give
you
no
further
unhappiness
of
that
kind
and
to
do
all
i
can
to
repair
these
first
come
and

my
child
she
said
turning
to

the
room
chapter
xii
obstacles
to
young
love
in
the
old
noblesse
had
recovered
as
to
manners
and
customs
something
of
the
prestige
it
had
irrevocably
lost
in
politics
moreover
the
sentiment
which
governs
parents
and
grandparents
in
all
that
relates
to
matrimonial
conventions
is
an
imperishable
sentiment
closely
allied
to
the
very
existence
of
civilized
societies
and
springing
from
the
spirit
of
family
it
rules
in
geneva
as
in
vienna
and
in
nemours
where
as
we
have
seen
zelie
minoret
refused
her
consent
to
a
possible
marriage
of
her
son
with
the
daughter
of
a
bastard
still
all
social
laws
have
their
exceptions
savinien
thought
he
might
bend
his
mother
s
pride
before
the
inborn
nobility
of
ursula
the
struggle
began
at
once
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
at
table
his
mother
told
him
of
the
horrible
letters
as
she
called
them
which
the
kergarouets
and
the
portendueres
had
written
her
there
is
no
such
thing
as
family
in
these
days
mother
replied
savinien
nothing
but
individuals
the
nobles
are
no
longer
a
compact
body
no
one
asks
or
cares
whether
i
am
a
portenduere
or
brave
or
a
statesmen
all
they
ask
is
what
taxes
does
he
pay
but
the
king
asked
the
old
lady
the
king
is
caught
between
the
two
chambers
like
a
man
between
his
wife
and
his
mistress
so
i
shall
have
to
marry
some
rich
girl
without
regard
to
family
the
daughter
of
a
peasant
if
she
has
a
million
and
is
sufficiently
well
that
is
to
say
if
she
has
been
taught
in
oh
there
s
no
need
to
talk
of
that
said
the
old
lady
savinien
frowned
as
he
heard
the
words
he
knew
the
granite
will
called
breton
obstinacy
that
distinguished
his
mother
and
he
resolved
to
know
at
once
her
opinion
on
this
delicate
matter
so
he
went
on
if
i
loved
a
young
girl
take
for
instance
your
neighbour
s
godchild
little
ursula
would
you
oppose
my
marriage
yes
as
long
as
i
live
she
replied
and
after
my
death
you
would
be
responsible
for
the
honor
and
the
blood
of
the
kergarouets
and
the
would
you
let
me
die
of
hunger
and
despair
for
the
chimera
of
nobility
which
has
no
reality
unless
it
has
the
lustre
of
great
wealth
you
could
serve
france
and
put
faith
in
would
you
postpone
my
happiness
till
after
your
death
it
would
be
horrible
if
you
took
it
then
that
is
all
i
have
to
louis
xiv
came
very
near
marrying
the
niece
of
mazarin
a
mazarin
himself
opposed
remember
the
widow
she
was
a
d
aubigne
besides
the
marriage
was
in
secret
but
i
am
very
old
my
son
she
said
shaking
her
head
when
i
am
no
more
you
can
as
you
say
marry
whom
you
savinien
both
loved
and
respected
his
mother
but
he
instantly
though
silently
set
himself
in
opposition
to
her
with
an
obstinacy
equal
to
her
own
resolving
to
have
no
other
wife
than
ursula
to
whom
this
opposition
gave
as
often
happens
in
similar
circumstances
the
value
of
a
forbidden
thing
when
after
vespers
the
doctor
with
ursula
who
was
dressed
in
pink
and
white
entered
the
cold
stiff
salon
the
girl
was
seized
with
nervous
trembling
as
though
she
had
entered
the
presence
of
the
queen
of
france
and
had
a
favor
to
beg
of
her
since
her
confession
to
the
doctor
this
little
house
had
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
palace
in
her
eyes
and
the
old
lady
herself
the
social
value
which
a
duchess
of
the
middle
ages
might
have
had
to
the
daughter
of
a
serf
never
had
ursula
measured
as
she
did
at
that
moment
the
distance
which
separated
vicomte
de
portenduere
from
the
daughter
of
a
regimental
musician
a
former
and
the
natural
son
of
an
organist
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
making
the
girl
sit
down
beside
her
madame
i
am
confused
by
the
honor
you
have
done
me
my
little
girl
said
madame
de
portenduere
in
her
sharpest
tone
i
know
how
fond
your
uncle
is
of
you
and
i
wished
to
be
agreeable
to
him
for
he
has
brought
back
my
prodigal
but
my
dear
mother
said
savinien
cut
to
the
heart
by
seeing
the
color
fly
into
ursula
s
face
as
she
struggled
to
keep
back
her
tears
even
if
we
were
under
no
obligations
to
monsieur
le
chevalier
minoret
i
think
we
should
always
be
most
grateful
for
the
pleasure
mademoiselle
has
given
us
by
accepting
your
the
young
man
pressed
the
doctor
s
hand
in
a
significant
manner
adding
i
see
you
wear
monsieur
the
order
of
the
oldest
order
in
france
and
one
which
confers
ursula
s
extreme
beauty
to
which
her
almost
hopeless
love
gave
a
depth
which
great
painters
have
sometimes
conveyed
in
pictures
where
the
soul
is
brought
into
strong
relief
had
struck
madame
de
portenduere
suddenly
and
made
her
suspect
that
the
doctor
s
apparent
generosity
masked
an
ambitious
scheme
she
had
made
the
speech
to
which
savinien
replied
with
the
intention
of
wounding
the
doctor
in
that
which
was
dearest
to
him
and
she
succeeded
though
the
old
man
could
hardly
restrain
a
smile
as
he
heard
himself
styled
a
chevalier
amused
to
observe
how
the
eagerness
of
a
lover
did
not
shrink
from
absurdity
the
order
of
which
in
former
days
men
committed
follies
to
obtain
he
said
has
now
monsieur
le
vicomte
gone
the
way
of
other
privileges
it
is
given
only
to
doctors
and
poor
artists
the
kings
have
done
well
to
join
it
to
that
of
who
was
i
believe
a
poor
devil
recalled
to
life
by
a
miracle
from
this
point
of
view
the
order
of
and
may
be
for
many
of
us
after
this
reply
at
once
sarcastic
and
dignified
silence
reigned
which
as
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
break
it
was
becoming
awkward
when
there
was
a
rap
at
the
door
there
is
our
dear
abbe
said
the
old
lady
who
rose
leaving
ursula
alone
and
advancing
to
meet
the
abbe
chaperon
an
honor
she
had
not
paid
to
the
doctor
and
his
niece
the
old
man
smiled
to
himself
as
he
looked
from
his
goddaughter
to
savinien
to
show
offence
or
to
complain
of
madame
de
portenduere
s
manners
was
a
rock
on
which
a
man
of
small
mind
might
have
struck
but
minoret
was
too
accomplished
in
the
ways
of
the
world
not
to
avoid
it
he
began
to
talk
to
the
viscount
of
the
danger
charles
was
then
running
by
confiding
the
affairs
of
the
nation
to
the
prince
de
polignac
when
sufficient
time
had
been
spent
on
the
subject
to
avoid
all
appearance
of
revenging
himself
by
so
doing
he
handed
the
old
lady
in
an
easy
jesting
way
a
packet
of
legal
papers
and
receipted
bills
together
with
the
account
of
his
notary
has
my
son
verified
them
she
said
giving
savinien
a
look
to
which
he
replied
by
bending
his
head
well
then
the
rest
is
my
notary
s
business
she
added
pushing
away
the
papers
and
treating
the
affair
with
the
disdain
she
wished
to
show
for
money
to
abase
wealth
was
according
to
madame
de
portenduere
s
ideas
to
elevate
the
nobility
and
rob
the
bourgeoisie
of
their
importance
a
few
moments
later
goupil
came
from
his
employer
dionis
to
ask
for
the
accounts
of
the
transaction
between
the
doctor
and
savinien
why
do
you
want
them
said
the
old
lady
to
put
the
matter
in
legal
form
there
have
been
no
cash
ursula
and
savinien
who
both
for
the
first
time
exchanged
a
glance
with
offensive
personage
were
conscious
of
a
sensation
like
that
of
touching
a
toad
aggravated
by
a
dark
presentiment
of
evil
they
both
had
the
same
indefinable
and
confused
vision
into
the
future
which
has
no
name
in
any
language
but
which
is
capable
of
explanation
as
the
action
of
the
inward
being
of
which
the
mysterious
swedenborgian
had
spoken
to
doctor
minoret
the
certainty
that
the
venomous
goupil
would
in
some
way
be
fatal
to
them
made
ursula
tremble
but
she
controlled
herself
conscious
of
unspeakable
pleasure
in
seeing
that
savinien
shared
her
emotion
he
is
not
handsome
that
clerk
of
monsieur
dionis
said
savinien
when
goupil
had
closed
the
door
what
does
it
signify
whether
such
persons
are
handsome
or
ugly
said
madame
de
portenduere
i
don
t
complain
of
his
ugliness
said
the
abbe
but
i
do
of
his
wickedness
which
passes
all
bounds
he
is
a
the
doctor
in
spite
of
his
desire
to
be
amiable
grew
cold
and
dignified
the
lovers
were
embarrassed
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
kindly
of
the
abbe
whose
gentle
gayety
enlivened
the
dinner
the
position
of
the
doctor
and
his
niece
would
have
been
almost
intolerable
at
dessert
seeing
ursula
turn
pale
he
said
to
her
if
you
don
t
feel
well
dear
child
we
have
only
the
street
to
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
said
the
old
lady
to
the
girl
madame
said
the
doctor
severely
her
soul
is
chilled
accustomed
as
she
is
to
be
met
by
a
very
bad
education
monsieur
said
madame
de
portenduere
is
it
not
monsieur
l
abbe
yes
answered
minoret
with
a
look
at
the
abbe
who
knew
not
how
to
reply
i
have
it
is
true
rendered
life
unbearable
to
an
angelic
spirit
if
she
has
to
pass
it
in
the
world
but
i
trust
i
shall
not
die
until
i
place
her
in
security
safe
from
coldness
indifference
and
hatred
oh
godfather
i
beg
of
you
say
no
more
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
cried
ursula
meeting
madame
de
portenduere
s
eyes
rather
than
give
too
much
meaning
to
her
words
by
looking
at
savinien
i
can
not
know
madame
said
savinien
to
his
mother
whether
mademoiselle
ursula
suffers
but
i
do
know
that
you
are
torturing
hearing
these
words
dragged
from
the
generous
young
man
by
his
mother
s
treatment
of
herself
ursula
turned
pale
and
begged
madame
de
portenduere
to
excuse
her
then
she
took
her
uncle
s
arm
bowed
left
the
room
and
returned
home
once
there
she
rushed
to
the
salon
and
sat
down
to
the
piano
put
her
head
in
her
hands
and
burst
into
tears
why
don
t
you
leave
the
management
of
your
affairs
to
my
old
experience
cruel
child
cried
the
doctor
in
despair
nobles
never
think
themselves
under
any
obligations
to
the
bourgeoisie
when
we
do
them
a
service
they
consider
that
we
do
our
duty
and
that
s
all
besides
the
old
lady
saw
that
you
looked
favorably
on
savinien
she
is
afraid
he
will
love
at
any
rate
he
is
saved
said
ursula
but
ah
to
try
to
humiliate
a
man
like
you
wait
till
i
return
my
child
said
the
old
man
leaving
her
when
the
doctor
madame
de
portenduere
s
salon
he
found
dionis
the
notary
accompanied
by
monsieur
bongrand
and
the
mayor
of
nemours
witnesses
required
by
law
for
the
validity
of
deeds
in
all
communes
where
there
is
but
one
notary
minoret
took
monsieur
dionis
aside
and
said
a
word
in
his
ear
after
which
the
notary
read
the
deeds
aloud
officially
from
which
it
appeared
that
madame
de
portenduere
gave
a
mortgage
on
all
her
property
to
secure
payment
of
the
hundred
thousand
francs
the
interest
on
which
was
fixed
at
five
per
cent
at
the
reading
of
this
last
clause
the
abbe
looked
at
minoret
who
answered
with
an
approving
nod
the
poor
priest
whispered
something
in
the
old
lady
s
ear
to
which
she
replied
i
will
owe
nothing
to
such
my
mother
leaves
me
the
nobler
part
said
savinien
to
the
doctor
she
will
repay
the
money
and
charges
me
to
show
our
but
you
will
have
to
pay
eleven
thousand
francs
the
first
year
to
meet
the
interest
and
the
legal
costs
said
the
abbe
monsieur
said
minoret
to
dionis
as
monsieur
and
madame
de
portenduere
are
not
in
a
condition
to
pay
those
costs
add
them
to
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
and
i
will
pay
dionis
made
the
change
and
the
sum
borrowed
was
fixed
at
one
hundred
and
seven
thousand
francs
when
the
papers
were
all
signed
minoret
made
his
fatigue
an
excuse
to
leave
the
house
at
the
same
time
as
the
notary
and
witnesses
madame
said
the
abbe
why
did
you
affront
the
excellent
monsieur
minoret
who
saved
you
at
least
thousand
francs
on
those
debts
in
paris
and
had
the
delicacy
to
give
twenty
thousand
to
your
son
for
his
debts
of
honor
your
minoret
is
sly
she
said
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
he
knows
what
he
is
my
mother
thinks
he
wishes
to
force
me
into
marrying
his
niece
by
getting
hold
of
our
farm
said
savinien
as
if
a
portenduere
son
of
a
kergarouet
could
be
made
to
marry
against
his
an
hour
later
savinien
presented
himself
at
the
doctor
s
house
where
all
the
relatives
had
assembled
enticed
by
curiosity
the
arrival
of
the
young
viscount
produced
a
lively
sensation
all
the
more
because
its
effect
was
different
on
each
person
present
mesdemoiselles
cremiere
and
massin
whispered
together
and
looked
at
ursula
who
blushed
the
mothers
said
to
desire
that
goupil
was
right
about
the
marriage
the
eyes
of
all
present
turned
towards
the
doctor
who
did
not
rise
to
receive
the
young
nobleman
but
merely
bowed
his
head
without
laying
down
the
for
he
was
playing
a
game
of
backgammon
with
monsieur
bongrand
the
doctor
s
cold
manner
surprised
every
one
ursula
my
child
he
said
give
us
a
little
while
the
young
girl
delighted
to
have
something
to
do
to
keep
her
in
countenance
went
to
the
piano
and
began
to
move
the
the
heirs
resigned
themselves
with
many
demonstrations
of
pleasure
to
the
torture
and
the
silence
about
to
be
inflicted
on
them
so
eager
were
they
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
between
their
uncle
and
the
portendueres
in
sometimes
happens
that
a
piece
of
music
poor
in
itself
when
played
by
a
young
girl
under
the
influence
of
deep
feeling
makes
more
impression
than
a
fine
overture
played
by
a
full
orchestra
in
all
music
there
is
besides
the
thought
of
the
composer
the
soul
of
the
performer
who
by
a
privilege
granted
to
this
art
only
can
give
both
meaning
and
poetry
to
passages
which
are
in
themselves
of
no
great
value
chopin
proves
for
that
unresponsive
instrument
the
piano
the
truth
of
this
fact
already
proved
by
paganini
on
the
violin
that
fine
genius
is
less
a
musician
than
a
soul
which
makes
itself
felt
and
communicates
itself
through
all
species
of
music
even
simple
chords
ursula
by
her
exquisite
and
sensitive
organization
belonged
to
this
rare
class
of
beings
and
old
schmucke
the
master
who
came
every
saturday
and
who
during
ursula
s
stay
in
paris
was
with
her
every
day
had
brought
his
pupil
s
talent
to
its
full
perfection
rousseau
s
dream
the
piece
now
chosen
by
ursula
composed
by
herold
in
his
young
days
is
not
without
a
certain
depth
which
is
capable
of
being
developed
by
execution
ursula
threw
into
it
the
feelings
which
were
agitating
her
being
and
justified
the
term
caprice
given
by
herold
to
the
fragment
with
soft
and
dreamy
touch
her
soul
spoke
to
the
young
man
s
soul
and
wrapped
it
as
in
a
cloud
with
ideas
that
were
almost
visible
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
piano
his
elbow
resting
on
the
cover
and
his
head
on
his
left
hand
savinien
admired
ursula
whose
eyes
fixed
on
the
paneling
of
the
wall
beyond
him
seemed
to
be
questioning
another
world
many
a
man
would
have
fallen
deeply
in
love
for
a
less
reason
genuine
feelings
have
a
magnetism
of
their
own
and
ursula
was
willing
to
show
her
soul
as
a
coquette
her
dresses
to
be
admired
savinien
entered
that
delightful
kingdom
led
by
this
pure
heart
which
to
interpret
its
feelings
borrowed
the
power
of
the
only
art
that
speaks
to
thought
by
thought
without
the
help
of
words
or
color
or
form
candor
openness
of
heart
have
the
same
power
over
a
man
that
childhood
has
the
same
charm
the
same
irresistible
seductions
ursula
was
never
more
honest
and
candid
than
at
this
moment
when
she
was
born
again
into
a
new
life
the
abbe
came
to
tear
savinien
from
his
dream
requesting
him
to
take
a
fourth
hand
at
whist
ursula
went
on
playing
the
heirs
departed
all
except
desire
who
was
resolved
to
find
out
the
intentions
of
his
uncle
and
the
viscount
and
ursula
you
have
as
much
talent
as
soul
mademoiselle
he
said
when
the
young
girl
closed
the
piano
and
sat
down
beside
her
godfather
who
is
your
master
a
german
living
close
to
the
rue
dauphine
on
the
quai
conti
said
the
doctor
if
he
had
not
given
ursula
a
lesson
every
day
during
her
stay
in
paris
he
would
have
been
here
he
is
not
only
a
great
musician
said
ursula
but
a
man
of
adorable
simplicity
of
those
lessons
must
cost
a
great
deal
remarked
desire
the
players
smiled
ironically
when
the
game
was
over
the
doctor
who
had
hitherto
seemed
anxious
and
pensive
turned
to
savinien
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
fulfills
a
duty
monsieur
he
said
i
am
grateful
for
the
feeling
which
leads
you
to
make
me
this
early
visit
but
your
mother
attributes
unworthy
and
underhand
motives
to
what
i
have
done
and
i
should
give
her
the
right
to
call
them
true
if
i
did
not
request
you
to
refrain
from
coming
here
in
spite
of
the
honor
your
visits
are
to
me
and
the
pleasure
i
should
otherwise
feel
in
cultivating
your
society
tell
your
mother
that
if
i
do
not
beg
her
in
my
niece
s
name
and
my
own
to
do
us
the
honor
of
dining
here
next
sunday
it
is
because
i
am
very
certain
that
she
would
find
herself
indisposed
on
that
the
old
man
held
out
his
hand
to
the
young
viscount
who
pressed
it
respectfully
saying
you
are
quite
right
he
then
withdrew
but
not
without
a
bow
to
ursula
in
which
there
was
more
of
sadness
than
disappointment
desire
left
the
house
at
the
same
time
but
he
found
it
impossible
to
exchange
even
a
word
with
the
young
nobleman
who
rushed
into
his
own
house
precipitately
chapter
xiii
betrothal
of
hearts
this
rupture
between
the
portendueres
and
doctor
minoret
gave
talk
among
the
heirs
for
a
week
they
did
homage
to
the
genius
of
dionis
and
regarded
their
inheritance
as
rescued
so
in
an
age
when
ranks
are
leveled
when
the
mania
for
equality
puts
everybody
on
one
footing
and
threatens
to
destroy
all
bulwarks
even
military
subordination
that
last
refuge
of
power
in
france
where
passions
have
now
no
other
obstacles
to
overcome
than
personal
antipathies
or
differences
of
fortune
the
obstinacy
of
an
breton
woman
and
the
dignity
of
doctor
minoret
created
a
barrier
between
these
lovers
which
was
to
end
as
such
obstacles
often
do
not
in
destroying
but
in
strengthening
love
to
an
ardent
man
a
woman
s
value
is
that
which
she
costs
him
savinien
foresaw
a
struggle
great
efforts
many
uncertainties
and
already
the
young
girl
was
rendered
dearer
to
him
he
was
resolved
to
win
her
perhaps
our
feelings
obey
the
laws
of
nature
as
to
the
lastingness
of
her
creations
to
a
long
life
a
long
childhood
the
next
morning
when
they
woke
ursula
and
savinien
had
the
same
thought
an
intimate
understanding
of
this
kind
would
create
love
if
it
were
not
already
its
most
precious
proof
when
the
young
girl
parted
her
curtains
just
far
enough
to
let
her
eyes
take
in
savinien
s
window
she
saw
the
face
of
her
lover
above
the
fastening
of
his
when
one
reflects
on
the
immense
services
that
windows
render
to
lovers
it
seems
natural
and
right
that
a
tax
should
be
levied
on
them
having
thus
protested
against
her
godfather
s
harshness
ursula
dropped
the
curtain
and
opened
her
window
to
close
the
outer
blinds
through
which
she
could
continue
to
see
without
being
seen
herself
seven
or
eight
times
during
the
day
she
went
up
to
her
room
always
to
find
the
young
viscount
writing
tearing
up
what
he
had
written
and
then
writing
again
to
her
no
doubt
the
next
morning
when
she
woke
la
bougival
gave
her
the
following
letter
to
mademoiselle
ursula
mademoiselle
i
do
not
conceal
from
myself
the
distrust
a
young
man
inspires
when
he
has
placed
himself
in
the
position
from
which
your
godfather
s
kindness
released
me
i
know
that
i
must
in
future
give
greater
guarantees
of
good
conduct
than
other
men
therefore
mademoiselle
it
is
with
deep
humility
that
i
place
myself
at
your
feet
and
ask
you
to
consider
my
love
this
declaration
is
not
dictated
by
passion
it
comes
from
an
inward
certainty
which
involves
the
whole
of
life
a
foolish
infatuation
for
my
young
aunt
madame
de
kergarouet
was
the
cause
of
my
going
to
prison
will
you
not
regard
as
a
proof
of
my
sincere
love
the
total
disappearance
of
those
wishes
of
that
image
now
effaced
from
my
heart
by
yours
no
sooner
did
i
see
you
asleep
and
so
engaging
in
your
childlike
slumber
at
bouron
than
you
occupied
my
soul
as
a
queen
takes
possession
of
her
empire
i
will
have
no
other
wife
than
you
you
have
every
qualification
i
desire
in
her
who
is
to
bear
my
name
the
education
you
have
received
and
the
dignity
of
your
own
mind
place
you
on
the
level
of
the
highest
positions
but
i
doubt
myself
too
much
to
dare
describe
you
to
yourself
i
can
only
love
you
after
listening
to
you
yesterday
i
recalled
certain
words
which
seem
as
though
written
for
you
suffer
me
to
transcribe
them
made
to
draw
all
hearts
and
charm
all
eyes
gentle
and
intelligent
spiritual
yet
able
to
reason
courteous
as
though
she
had
passed
her
life
at
court
simple
as
the
hermit
who
had
never
known
the
world
the
fire
of
her
soul
is
tempered
in
her
eyes
by
sacred
i
feel
the
value
of
the
noble
soul
revealed
in
you
by
many
even
the
most
trifling
things
this
it
is
which
gives
me
the
courage
to
ask
you
provided
you
love
no
one
else
to
let
me
prove
to
you
by
my
conduct
and
my
devotion
that
i
am
not
unworthy
of
you
it
concerns
my
very
life
you
can
not
doubt
that
all
my
powers
will
be
employed
not
only
in
trying
to
please
you
but
in
deserving
your
esteem
which
is
more
precious
to
me
than
any
other
upon
earth
with
this
hope
ursula
if
you
will
suffer
me
so
to
call
you
in
my
heart
nemours
will
be
to
me
a
paradise
the
hardest
tasks
will
bring
me
joys
derived
through
you
as
life
itself
is
derived
from
god
tell
me
that
i
may
call
myself
your
savinien
ursula
kissed
the
letter
then
having
it
and
clasped
it
with
passionate
motions
she
dressed
herself
eagerly
to
carry
it
to
her
uncle
ah
my
god
i
nearly
forgot
to
say
my
prayers
she
exclaimed
turning
back
to
kneel
on
her
a
few
moments
later
she
went
down
to
the
garden
where
she
found
her
godfather
and
made
him
read
the
letter
they
both
sat
down
on
a
bench
under
the
arch
of
climbing
plants
opposite
to
the
chinese
pagoda
ursula
awaited
the
old
man
s
words
and
the
old
man
reflected
long
too
long
for
the
impatient
young
girl
at
last
the
result
of
their
secret
interview
appeared
in
the
following
answer
part
of
which
the
doctor
undoubtedly
dictated
to
monsieur
le
vicomte
savinien
de
portenduere
monsieur
i
can
not
be
otherwise
than
greatly
honored
by
the
letter
in
which
you
offer
me
your
hand
but
at
my
age
and
according
to
the
rules
of
my
education
i
have
felt
bound
to
communicate
it
to
my
godfather
who
is
all
i
have
and
whom
i
love
as
a
father
and
also
as
a
friend
i
must
now
tell
you
the
painful
objections
which
he
has
made
to
me
and
which
must
be
to
you
my
answer
monsieur
le
vicomte
i
am
a
poor
girl
whose
fortune
depends
entirely
not
only
on
my
godfather
s
but
also
on
the
doubtful
success
of
the
measures
he
may
take
to
elude
the
schemes
of
his
relatives
against
me
though
i
am
the
legitimate
daughter
of
joseph
mirouet
of
the
regiment
of
infantry
my
father
himself
was
my
godfather
s
natural
and
therefore
these
relatives
may
though
without
reason
being
a
suit
against
a
young
girl
who
would
be
defenceless
you
see
monsieur
that
the
smallness
of
my
fortune
is
not
my
greatest
misfortune
i
have
many
things
to
make
me
humble
it
is
for
your
sake
and
not
for
my
own
that
i
lay
before
you
these
facts
which
to
loving
and
devoted
hearts
are
sometimes
of
little
weight
but
i
beg
you
to
consider
monsieur
that
if
i
did
not
submit
them
to
you
i
might
be
suspected
of
leading
your
tenderness
to
overlook
obstacles
which
the
world
and
more
especially
your
mother
regard
as
insuperable
i
shall
be
sixteen
in
four
months
perhaps
you
will
admit
that
we
are
both
too
young
and
too
inexperienced
to
understand
the
miseries
of
a
life
entered
upon
without
other
fortune
than
that
i
have
received
from
the
kindness
of
the
late
monsieur
de
jordy
my
godfather
desires
moreover
not
to
marry
me
until
i
am
twenty
who
knows
what
fate
may
have
in
store
for
you
in
four
years
the
finest
years
of
your
life
do
not
sacrifice
them
to
a
poor
girl
having
thus
explained
to
you
monsieur
the
opinions
of
my
dear
godfather
who
far
from
opposing
my
happiness
seeks
to
contribute
to
it
in
every
way
and
earnestly
desires
that
his
protection
which
must
soon
fail
me
may
be
replaced
by
a
tenderness
equal
to
his
own
there
remains
only
to
tell
you
how
touched
i
am
by
your
offer
and
by
the
compliments
which
accompany
it
the
prudence
which
dictates
my
letter
is
that
of
an
old
man
to
whom
life
is
but
the
gratitude
i
express
is
that
of
a
young
girl
in
whose
soul
no
other
sentiment
has
arisen
therefore
monsieur
i
can
sign
myself
in
all
sincerity
your
servant
ursula
mirouet
savinien
made
no
reply
was
he
trying
to
soften
his
mother
had
this
letter
put
an
end
to
his
love
many
such
questions
all
insoluble
tormented
poor
ursula
and
by
repercussion
the
doctor
too
who
suffered
from
every
agitation
of
his
darling
child
ursula
went
often
to
her
chamber
to
look
at
savinien
whom
she
usually
found
sitting
pensively
before
his
table
with
his
eyes
turned
towards
her
window
at
the
end
of
the
week
but
no
sooner
she
received
a
letter
from
him
the
delay
was
explained
by
his
increasing
love
to
mademoiselle
ursula
mirouet
dear
ursula
i
am
a
breton
and
when
my
mind
is
once
made
up
nothing
can
change
me
your
godfather
whom
may
god
preserve
to
us
is
right
but
does
it
follow
that
i
am
wrong
in
loving
you
therefore
all
i
want
to
know
from
you
is
whether
you
could
love
me
tell
me
this
if
only
by
a
sign
and
then
the
next
four
years
will
be
the
finest
of
my
life
a
friend
of
mine
has
delivered
to
my
kergarouet
a
letter
in
which
i
asked
his
help
to
enter
the
navy
the
kind
old
man
grieved
at
my
misfortune
replies
that
even
the
king
s
favor
would
be
thwarted
by
the
rules
of
the
service
in
case
i
wanted
a
certain
rank
nevertheless
if
i
study
three
months
at
toulon
the
minister
of
war
can
send
me
to
sea
as
master
s
mate
then
after
a
cruise
against
the
algerines
with
whom
we
are
now
at
war
i
can
go
through
an
examination
and
become
a
midshipman
moreover
if
i
distinguish
myself
in
an
expedition
they
are
fitting
out
against
algiers
i
shall
certainly
be
made
ensign
but
how
soon
that
no
one
can
tell
only
they
will
make
the
rules
as
elastic
as
possible
to
have
the
name
of
portenduere
again
in
the
navy
i
see
very
plainly
that
i
can
only
hope
to
obtain
you
from
your
godfather
and
your
respect
for
him
makes
you
still
dearer
to
me
before
replying
to
the
admiral
i
must
have
an
interview
with
the
doctor
on
his
reply
my
whole
future
will
depend
whatever
comes
of
it
know
this
that
rich
or
poor
the
daughter
of
a
band
master
or
the
daughter
of
a
king
you
are
the
woman
whom
the
voice
of
my
heart
points
out
to
me
dear
ursula
we
live
in
times
when
prejudices
which
might
once
have
separated
us
have
no
power
to
prevent
our
marriage
to
you
then
i
offer
the
feelings
of
my
heart
to
your
uncle
the
guarantees
which
secure
to
him
your
happiness
he
has
not
seen
that
i
in
a
few
hours
came
to
love
you
more
than
he
has
loved
you
in
fifteen
years
until
this
evening
savinien
here
godfather
said
ursula
holding
the
letter
out
to
him
with
a
proud
gesture
ah
my
child
cried
the
doctor
when
he
had
read
it
i
am
happier
than
even
you
he
repairs
all
his
faults
by
this
after
dinner
savinien
presented
himself
and
found
the
doctor
walking
with
ursula
by
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
overlooking
the
river
the
viscount
had
received
his
clothes
from
paris
and
had
not
missed
heightening
his
natural
advantages
by
a
careful
toilet
as
elegant
as
though
he
were
striving
to
please
the
proud
and
beautiful
comtesse
de
kergarouet
seeing
him
approach
her
from
the
portico
the
poor
girl
clung
to
her
uncle
s
arm
as
though
she
were
saving
herself
from
a
fall
over
a
precipice
and
the
doctor
heard
the
beating
of
her
heart
which
made
him
shudder
leave
us
my
child
he
said
to
the
girl
who
went
to
the
pagoda
and
sat
upon
the
steps
after
allowing
savinien
to
take
her
hand
and
kiss
it
respectfully
monsieur
will
you
give
this
dear
hand
to
a
naval
captain
he
said
to
the
doctor
in
a
low
voice
no
said
minoret
smiling
we
might
have
to
wait
too
long
but
i
will
give
her
to
a
tears
of
joy
filled
the
young
man
s
eyes
as
he
pressed
the
doctor
s
hand
affectionately
i
am
about
to
leave
he
said
to
study
hard
and
try
to
learn
in
six
months
what
the
pupils
of
the
naval
school
take
six
years
to
you
are
going
said
ursula
springing
towards
them
from
the
pavilion
yes
mademoiselle
to
deserve
you
therefore
the
more
eager
i
am
to
go
the
more
i
prove
to
you
my
this
is
the
of
october
she
said
looking
at
him
with
infinite
tenderness
do
not
go
till
after
the
yes
said
the
old
man
we
will
celebrate
s
then
cried
the
young
man
i
must
spend
this
week
in
paris
to
take
the
preliminary
steps
buy
books
and
mathematical
instruments
and
try
to
conciliate
the
minister
and
get
the
best
terms
that
i
can
for
ursula
and
her
godfather
accompanied
savinien
to
the
gate
soon
after
he
entered
his
mother
s
house
they
saw
him
come
out
again
followed
by
tiennette
carrying
his
valise
if
you
are
rich
said
ursula
to
her
uncle
why
do
you
make
him
serve
in
the
navy
presently
it
will
be
i
who
incurred
his
debts
said
the
doctor
smiling
i
don
t
oblige
him
to
do
anything
but
the
uniform
my
dear
and
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
won
in
battle
will
wipe
out
many
stains
before
six
years
are
over
he
may
be
in
command
of
a
ship
and
that
s
all
i
ask
of
but
he
may
be
killed
she
said
turning
a
pale
face
upon
the
doctor
lovers
like
drunkards
have
a
providence
of
their
own
he
said
laughing
that
night
the
poor
child
with
la
bougival
s
help
cut
off
a
sufficient
quantity
of
her
long
and
beautiful
blond
hair
to
make
a
chain
and
the
next
day
she
persuaded
old
schmucke
the
to
take
it
to
paris
and
have
the
chain
made
and
returned
by
the
following
sunday
when
savinien
got
back
he
informed
the
doctor
and
ursula
that
he
had
signed
his
articles
and
was
to
be
at
brest
on
the
the
doctor
asked
him
to
dinner
on
the
and
he
passed
nearly
two
whole
days
in
the
old
man
s
house
notwithstanding
much
sage
advice
and
many
resolutions
the
lovers
could
not
help
betraying
their
secret
understanding
to
the
watchful
eyes
of
the
abbe
monsieur
bongrand
the
nemours
doctor
and
la
bougival
children
said
the
old
man
you
are
risking
your
happiness
by
not
keeping
it
to
on
the
after
mass
during
which
several
glances
had
been
exchanged
savinien
watched
by
ursula
crossed
the
road
and
entered
the
little
garden
where
the
pair
were
practically
alone
for
the
kind
old
man
by
way
of
indulgence
was
reading
his
newspapers
in
the
pagoda
dear
ursula
said
savinien
will
you
make
a
gift
greater
than
my
mother
could
make
me
even
if
i
know
what
you
wish
to
ask
me
she
said
interrupting
him
see
here
is
my
answer
she
added
taking
from
the
pocket
of
her
apron
the
box
containing
the
chain
made
of
her
hair
and
offering
it
to
him
with
a
nervous
tremor
which
testified
to
her
illimitable
happiness
wear
it
she
said
for
love
of
me
may
it
shield
you
from
all
dangers
by
reminding
you
that
my
life
depends
on
naughty
little
thing
she
is
giving
him
a
chain
of
her
hair
said
the
doctor
to
himself
how
did
she
manage
to
get
it
what
a
pity
to
cut
those
beautiful
fair
tresses
she
will
be
giving
him
my
life
s
blood
you
will
not
blame
me
if
i
ask
you
to
give
me
now
that
i
am
leaving
you
a
formal
promise
to
have
no
other
husband
than
me
said
savinien
kissing
the
chain
and
looking
at
ursula
with
tears
in
his
eyes
have
i
not
said
so
too
often
i
who
went
to
see
the
walls
of
when
you
were
behind
them
she
replied
blushing
i
repeat
it
savinien
i
shall
never
love
any
one
but
you
and
i
will
be
yours
seeing
that
ursula
was
by
the
creepers
the
young
man
could
not
deny
himself
the
happiness
of
pressing
her
to
his
heart
and
kissing
her
forehead
but
she
gave
a
feeble
cry
and
dropped
upon
the
bench
and
when
savinien
sat
beside
her
entreating
pardon
he
saw
the
doctor
standing
before
them
my
friend
said
the
old
man
ursula
is
a
born
sensitive
too
rough
a
word
might
kill
her
for
her
sake
you
must
moderate
the
enthusiasm
of
your
love
ah
if
you
had
loved
her
for
sixteen
years
as
i
have
you
would
have
been
satisfied
with
her
word
of
promise
he
added
to
revenge
himself
for
the
last
sentence
in
savinien
s
second
letter
two
days
later
the
young
man
departed
in
spite
of
the
letters
which
he
wrote
regularly
to
ursula
she
fell
a
prey
to
an
illness
without
apparent
cause
like
a
fine
fruit
with
a
worm
at
the
core
a
single
thought
gnawed
her
heart
she
lost
both
appetite
and
color
the
first
time
her
godfather
asked
her
what
she
felt
she
replied
i
want
to
see
the
it
is
difficult
to
take
you
to
a
in
the
depth
of
winter
answered
the
old
man
shall
i
really
go
she
said
if
the
wind
was
high
ursula
was
inwardly
convulsed
certain
in
spite
of
the
learned
assurances
of
the
doctor
and
the
abbe
that
savinien
was
being
tossed
about
in
a
whirlwind
monsieur
bongrand
made
her
happy
for
days
with
the
gift
of
an
engraving
representing
a
midshipman
in
uniform
she
read
the
newspapers
imagining
that
they
would
give
news
of
the
cruiser
on
which
her
lover
sailed
she
devoured
cooper
s
and
learned
to
use
such
proofs
of
concentration
of
feeling
often
assumed
by
other
women
were
so
genuine
in
ursula
that
she
saw
in
dreams
the
coming
of
savinien
s
letters
and
never
failed
to
announce
them
relating
the
dream
as
a
forerunner
now
she
said
to
the
doctor
the
fourth
time
that
this
happened
i
am
easy
wherever
savinien
may
be
if
he
is
wounded
i
shall
know
it
the
old
doctor
thought
over
this
remark
so
anxiously
that
the
abbe
and
monsieur
bongrand
were
troubled
by
the
sorrowful
expression
of
his
face
what
pains
you
they
said
when
ursula
had
left
them
will
she
live
replied
the
doctor
can
so
tender
and
delicate
a
flower
endure
the
trials
of
the
heart
nevertheless
the
little
dreamer
as
the
abbe
called
her
was
working
hard
she
understood
the
importance
of
a
fine
education
to
a
woman
of
the
world
and
all
the
time
she
did
not
give
to
her
singing
and
to
the
study
of
harmony
and
composition
she
spent
in
reading
the
books
chosen
for
her
by
the
abbe
from
her
godfather
s
rich
library
and
yet
while
leading
this
busy
life
she
suffered
though
without
complaint
sometimes
she
would
sit
for
hours
looking
at
savinien
s
window
on
sundays
she
would
leave
the
church
behind
madame
de
portenduere
and
watch
her
tenderly
for
in
spite
of
the
old
lady
s
harshness
she
loved
her
as
savinien
s
mother
her
piety
increased
she
went
to
mass
every
morning
for
she
firmly
believed
that
her
dreams
were
the
gift
of
god
at
last
her
godfather
frightened
by
the
effects
produced
by
this
nostalgia
of
love
promised
on
her
birthday
to
take
her
to
toulon
to
see
the
departure
of
the
fleet
for
algiers
savinien
s
ship
formed
part
of
it
but
he
was
not
to
be
informed
beforehand
of
their
intention
the
abbe
and
monsieur
bongrand
kept
secret
the
object
of
this
journey
said
to
be
for
ursula
s
health
which
disturbed
and
greatly
puzzled
the
relations
after
beholding
savinien
in
his
naval
uniform
and
going
on
board
the
fine
of
the
admiral
to
whom
the
minister
had
given
young
portenduere
a
special
recommendation
ursula
at
her
lover
s
entreaty
went
with
her
godfather
to
nice
and
along
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
to
genoa
where
she
heard
of
the
safe
arrival
of
the
fleet
at
algiers
and
the
landing
of
the
troops
the
doctor
would
have
liked
to
continue
the
journey
through
italy
as
much
to
distract
ursula
s
mind
as
to
finish
in
some
sense
her
education
by
enlarging
her
ideas
through
comparison
with
other
manners
and
customs
and
countries
and
by
the
fascination
of
a
land
where
the
masterpieces
of
art
can
still
be
seen
and
where
so
many
civilizations
have
left
their
brilliant
traces
but
the
tidings
of
the
opposition
by
the
throne
to
the
newly
elected
chamber
of
obliged
the
doctor
to
return
to
france
bringing
back
his
treasure
in
a
flourishing
state
of
health
and
possessed
of

charming
little

word
of
mouth
the
result
of
the
antagonism
which
was
defined
for
the
first
time
between
the
two
classes

all
the
adherents

retained
his
place
only
through

influence
of

was

on
the
tapis

by
post
for
paris
and
invested
five
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
in
shares
to
bearer
the
rest
of
his
fortune
which
amounted
to
about
two
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
francs
standing
in
his
own
name
in
the
same
funds
gave
him
ostensibly
an
income
of
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
he
made
the
same
disposition
of
ursula
s
little
capital
bequeathed
to
her
by
de
jordy
together
with
the
accrued
interest
thereon
which
gave
her
about
fourteen
hundred
francs
a
year
in
her
own
right
la
bougival
who
had
laid
by
some
five
thousand
francs
of
her
savings
did
the
same
by
the
doctor
s
advice
receiving
in
future
three
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
year
in
dividends
these
judicious
transactions
agreed
on
between
the
doctor
and
monsieur
bongrand
were
carried
out
in
perfect
secrecy
thanks
to
the
political
troubles
of
the
time
when
quiet
was
again
restored
the
doctor
bought
the
little
house
which
adjoined
his
own
and
pulled
it
down
so
as
to
build
a
and
stables
on
its
side
to
employ
a
capital
which
would
have
given
him
a
thousand
francs
a
year
on
outbuildings
seemed
actual
folly
to
the
minoret
heirs
this
folly
if
it
were
one
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
in
the
doctor
s
existence
for
he
now
at
a
period
when
horses
and
carriages
were
almost
given
away
brought
back
from
paris
three
fine
horses
and
a
caleche
when
in
the
early
part
of
november
the
old
man
came
to
church
on
a
rainy
day
in
the
new
carriage
and
gave
his
hand
to
ursula
to
help
her
out
all
the
inhabitants
flocked
to
the
square
as
much
to
see
the
caleche
and
question
the
coachman
as
to
criticize
the
goddaughter
to
whose
excessive
pride
and
ambition
massin
cremiere
the
post
master
and
their
wives
attributed
this
extravagant
folly
of
the
old
man
a
caleche
hey
massin
cried
goupil
your
inheritance
will
go
at
top
speed
now
you
ought
to
be
getting
good
wages
cabirolle
said
the
post
master
to
the
son
of
one
of
his
conductors
who
stood
by
the
horses
for
it
is
to
be
supposed
an
old
man
of
won
t
use
up
many
what
did
those
horses
cost
four
thousand
francs
the
caleche
though
was
two
thousand
but
it
s
a
fine
one
the
wheels
are
yes
it
s
a
good
carriage
said
cremiere
and
a
man
must
be
rich
to
buy
that
style
of
ursula
means
to
go
at
a
good
pace
said
goupil
she
s
right
she
s
showing
you
how
to
enjoy
life
why
don
t
you
have
fine
carriages
and
horses
papa
minoret
i
wouldn
t
let
myself
be
humiliated
if
i
were
you
i
d
buy
a
carriage
fit
for

come
cabirolle
tell
us
said
massin
is
it
the
girl
who
drives
our
uncle
into
such
luxury
i
don
t
know
said
cabirolle
but
she
is
almost
mistress
of
the
house
there
are
masters
upon
masters
down
from
paris
they
say
now
she
is
going
to
study
then
i
shall
seize
the
occasion
to
have
my
portrait
drawn
said
madame
cremiere
in
the
provinces
they
always
say
a
picture
is
drawn
not
painted
the
old
german
is
not
dismissed
is
he
said
madame
massin
he
was
there
yesterday
replied
cabirolle
now
said
goupil
you
may
as
well
give
up
counting
on
your
inheritance
ursula
is
seventeen
years
old
and
she
is
prettier
than
ever
travel
forms
young
people
and
the
little
minx
has
got
your
uncle
in
the
toils
five
or
six
parcels
come
down
for
her
by
the
diligence
every
week
and
the
dressmakers
and
milliners
come
too
to
try
on
her
gowns
and
all
the
rest
of
it
madame
dionis
is
furious
watch
for
ursula
as
she
comes
out
of
church
and
look
at
the
little
scarf
she
is
wearing
round
her
neck
real
cashmere
and
it
cost
six
hundred
francs
if
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
in
the
midst
of
the
heirs
the
effect
would
have
been
less
than
that
of
goupil
s
last
words
the
stood
by
rubbing
his
hands
the
doctor
s
old
green
salon
had
been
renovated
by
a
parisian
upholsterer
judged
by
the
luxury
displayed
he
was
sometimes
accused
of
hoarding
immense
wealth
sometimes
of
spending
his
capital
on
ursula
the
heirs
called
him
in
turn
a
miser
and
a
spendthrift
but
the
saying
he
s
an
old
fool
summed
upon
on
the
whole
the
verdict
of
the
neighbourhood
these
mistaken
judgments
of
the
little
town
had
the
one
advantage
of
misleading
the
heirs
who
never
suspected
the
love
between
savinien
and
ursula
which
was
the
secret
reason
of
the
doctor
s
expenditure
the
old
man
took
the
greatest
delights
in
accustoming
his
godchild
to
her
future
station
in
the
world
possessing
an
income
of
over
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
adorn
his
idol
in
the
month
of
february
the
day
when
ursula
was
eighteen
her
eyes
beheld
savinien
in
the
uniform
of
an
ensign
as
she
looked
from
her
window
when
she
rose
in
the
morning
why
didn
t
i
know
he
was
coming
she
said
to
herself
after
the
taking
of
algiers
savinien
had
distinguished
himself
by
an
act
of
courage
which
won
him
the
cross
the
corvette
on
which
he
was
serving
was
many
months
at
sea
without
his
being
able
to
communicate
with
the
doctor
and
he
did
not
wish
to
leave
the
service
without
consulting
him
desirous
of
retaining
in
the
navy
a
name
already
illustrious
in
its
service
the
new
government
had
profited
by
a
general
change
of
officers
to
make
savinien
an
ensign
having
obtained
leave
of
absence
for
fifteen
days
the
new
officer
arrived
from
toulon
by
the
mail
in
time
for
ursula
s
fete
intending
to
consult
the
doctor
at
the
same
time
he
has
come
cried
ursula
rushing
into
her
godfather
s
bedroom
very
good
he
answered
i
can
guess
what
brings
him
and
he
may
now
stay
in
ah
that
s
my
birthday
present
it
is
all
in
that
sentence
she
said
kissing
him
on
a
sign
which
she
ran
up
to
make
from
her
window
savinien
came
over
at
once
she
longed
to
admire
him
for
he
seemed
to
her
so
changed
for
the
better
military
service
does
in
fact
give
a
certain
grave
decision
to
the
air
and
carriage
and
gestures
of
a
man
and
an
erect
bearing
which
enables
the
most
superficial
observer
to
recognize
a
military
man
even
in
plain
clothes
the
habit
of
command
produces
this
result
ursula
loved
savinien
the
better
for
it
and
took
a
childlike
pleasure
in
walking
round
the
garden
with
him
taking
his
arm
and
hearing
him
relate
the
part
he
played
as
midshipman
in
the
taking
of
algiers
evidently
savinien
had
taken
the
city
the
doctor
who
had
been
watching
them
from
his
window
as
he
dressed
soon
came
down
without
telling
the
viscount
everything
he
did
say
that
in
case
madame
de
portenduere
consented
to
his
marriage
with
ursula
the
fortune
of
his
godchild
would
make
his
naval
pay
superfluous
alas
said
savinien
it
will
take
a
great
deal
of
time
to
overcome
my
mother
s
opposition
before
i
left
her
to
enter
the
navy
she
was
placed
between
two
alternatives
either
to
consent
to
my
marrying
ursula
or
else
to
see
me
only
from
time
to
time
and
to
know
me
exposed
to
the
dangers
of
the
profession
and
you
see
she
chose
to
let
me
but
savinien
we
shall
be
together
said
ursula
taking
his
hand
and
shaking
it
with
a
sort
of
impatience
to
see
each
other
and
not
to
part
that
was
the
all
of
love
to
her
she
saw
nothing
beyond
it
and
her
pretty
gesture
and
the
petulant
tone
of
her
voice
expressed
such
innocence
that
savinien
and
the
doctor
were
both
moved
by
it
the
resignation
was
written
and
despatched
and
ursula
s
fete
received
full
glory
from
the
presence
of
her
betrothed
a
few
months
later
towards
the
month
of
may
the
of
the
doctor
s
household
had
resumed
the
quite
tenor
of
its
way
but
with
one
welcome
visitor
the
more
the
attentions
of
the
young
viscount
were
soon
interpreted
in
the
town
as
those
of
a
future
husband
all
the
more
because
his
manners
and
those
of
ursula
whether
in
church
or
on
the
promenade
though
dignified
and
reserved
betrayed
the
understanding
of
their
hearts
dionis
pointed
out
to
the
heirs
that
the
doctor
had
never
asked
madame
de
portenduere
for
the
interest
of
his
money
three
years
of
which
was
now
due
she
ll
be
forced
to
yield
and
consent
to
this
derogatory
marriage
of
her
son
said
the
notary
if
such
a
misfortune
happens
it
is
probable
that
the
greater
part
of
your
uncle
s
fortune
will
serve
for
what
basile
calls
an
irresistible
chapter
xiv
ursula
again
orphaned
the
irritation
of
the
heirs
when
convinced
that
their
uncle
loved
ursula
too
well
not
to
secure
her
happiness
at
their
expense
became
as
underhand
as
it
was
bitter
meeting
in
dionis
s
salon
as
they
had
done
every
evening
since
the
revolution
of
they
inveighed
against
the
lovers
and
seldom
separated
without
discussing
some
way
of
circumventing
the
old
man
zelie
who
had
doubtless
profited
by
the
fall
in
the
funds
as
the
doctor
had
done
to
invest
some
at
least
of
her
enormous
gains
was
bitterest
of
them
all
against
the
orphan
girl
and
the
portendueres
one
evening
when
goupil
who
usually
avoided
the
dullness
of
these
meetings
had
come
in
to
learn
something
of
the
affairs
of
the
town
which
were
under
discussion
zelie
s
hatred
was
freshly
excited
she
had
seen
the
doctor
ursula
and
savinien
returning
in
the
caleche
from
a
country
drive
with
an
air
of
intimacy
that
told
all
i
d
give
thirty
thousand
francs
if
god
would
call
uncle
to
himself
before
the
marriage
of
young
portenduere
with
that
affected
minx
can
take
place
she
said
goupil
accompanied
monsieur
and
madame
minoret
to
the
middle
of
their
great
courtyard
and
there
said
looking
round
to
see
if
they
were
quite
alone
will
you
give
me
the
means
of
buying
dionis
s
practice
if
you
will
i
will
break
off
the
marriage
between
portenduere
and
how
asked
the
colossus
do
you
think
i
am
such
a
fool
as
to
tell
you
my
plan
said
the
notary
s
head
clerk
well
my
lad
separate
them
and
we
ll
see
what
we
can
do
said
zelie
i
don
t
embark
in
any
such
business
on
a
we
ll
the
young
man
is
a
who
might
kill
me
i
ought
to
be
and
as
good
a
hand
with
a
sword
or
a
pistol
as
he
is
set
me
up
in
business
and
i
ll
keep
my
prevent
the
marriage
and
i
will
set
you
up
said
the
post
master
it
is
nine
months
since
you
have
been
thinking
of
lending
me
a
paltry
fifteen
thousand
francs
to
buy
lecoeur
s
practice
and
you
expect
me
to
trust
you
now
nonsense
you
ll
lose
your
uncle
s
property
and
serve
you
it
if
were
only
a
matter
of
fifteen
thousand
francs
and
lecoeur
s
practice
that
might
be
managed
said
zelie
but
to
give
security
for
you
in
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
is
another
but
i
ll
do
my
part
said
goupil
flinging
a
seductive
look
at
zelie
which
encountered
the
imperious
glance
of
the
post
mistress
the
effect
was
that
of
venom
on
steel
we
can
wait
said
zelie
the
devil
s
own
spirit
is
in
you
thought
goupil
if
i
ever
catch
that
pair
in
my
power
he
said
to
himself
as
he
left
the
yard
i
ll
squeeze
them
like
by
cultivating
the
society
of
the
doctor
the
abbe
and
monsieur
bongrand
savinien
proved
the
excellence
of
his
character
the
love
of
this
young
man
for
ursula
so
devoid
of
and
so
persistent
interested
the
three
friends
deeply
and
they
now
never
separated
the
lovers
in
their
thoughts
soon
the
monotony
of
this
patriarchal
life
and
the
certainty
of
a
future
before
them
gave
to
their
affection
a
fraternal
character
the
doctor
often
left
the
pair
alone
together
he
judged
the
young
man
rightly
he
saw
him
kiss
her
hand
on
arriving
but
he
knew
he
would
ask
no
kiss
when
alone
with
her
so
deeply
did
the
lover
respect
the
innocence
the
frankness
of
the
young
girl
whose
excessive
sensibility
often
tried
taught
him
that
a
harsh
word
a
cold
look
or
the
alternations
of
gentleness
and
roughness
might
kill
her
the
only
freedom
between
the
two
took
place
before
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
in
the
evenings
two
years
full
of
secret
happiness
passed
thus
without
other
events
than
the
fruitless
efforts
made
by
the
young
man
to
obtain
from
his
mother
her
consent
to
his
marriage
he
talked
to
her
sometimes
for
hours
together
she
listened
and
made
no
answer
to
his
entreaties
other
than
by
breton
silence
or
a
positive
denial
at
nineteen
years
of
age
ursula
elegant
in
appearance
a
fine
musician
and
well
brought
up
had
nothing
more
to
learn
she
was
perfected
the
fame
of
her
beauty
and
grace
and
education
spread
far
the
doctor
was
called
upon
to
decline
the
overtures
of
madame
d
aiglemont
who
was
thinking
of
ursula
for
her
eldest
son
six
months
later
in
spite
of
the
secrecy
the
doctor
and
ursula
maintained
on
this
subject
savinien
heard
of
it
touched
by
so
much
delicacy
he
made
use
of
the
incident
in
another
attempt
to
vanquish
his
mother
s
obstinacy
but
she
merely
replied
if
the
d
aiglemonts
choose
to
ally
themselves
ill
is
that
any
reason
why
we
should
do
so
in
december
the
kind
and
now
truly
pious
old
doctor
then
years
old
declined
visibly
when
seen
out
of
doors
his
face
pinched
and
wan
and
his
eyes
pale
all
the
town
talked
of
his
approaching
death
you
ll
soon
know
results
said
the
community
to
the
heirs
in
truth
the
old
man
s
death
had
all
the
attraction
of
a
problem
but
the
doctor
himself
did
not
know
he
was
ill
he
had
his
illusions
and
neither
poor
ursula
nor
savinien
nor
bongrand
nor
the
abbe
were
willing
to
enlighten
him
as
to
his
condition
the
nemours
doctor
who
came
to
see
him
every
day
did
not
venture
to
prescribe
old
minoret
felt
no
pain
his
lamp
of
life
was
gently
going
out
his
mind
continued
firm
and
clear
and
powerful
in
old
men
thus
constituted
the
soul
governs
the
body
and
gives
it
strength
to
die
erect
the
abbe
anxious
not
to
hasten
the
fatal
end
released
his
parishioner
from
the
duty
of
hearing
mass
in
church
and
allowed
him
to
read
the
services
at
home
for
the
doctor
faithfully
attended
to
all
his
religious
duties
the
nearer
he
came
to
the
grave
the
more
he
loved
god
the
lights
eternal
shone
upon
all
difficulties
and
explained
them
more
and
more
clearly
to
his
mind
early
in
the
year
ursula
persuaded
him
to
sell
the
carriage
and
horses
and
dismiss
cabirolle
monsieur
bongrand
whose
uneasiness
about
ursula
s
future
was
far
from
quieted
by
the
doctor
s
boldly
opened
the
subject
one
evening
and
showed
his
old
friend
the
importance
of
making
ursula
legally
of
age
still
the
old
man
though
he
had
often
consulted
the
justice
of
peace
would
not
reveal
to
him
the
secret
of
his
provision
for
ursula
though
he
agreed
to
the
necessity
of
securing
her
independence
by
majority
the
more
monsieur
bongrand
persisted
in
his
efforts
to
discover
the
means
selected
by
his
old
friend
to
provide
for
his
darling
the
more
wary
the
doctor
became
why
not
secure
the
thing
said
bongrand
why
run
any
risks
when
you
are
between
two
risks
replied
the
doctor
avoid
the
most
bongrand
carried
through
the
business
of
making
ursula
of
age
so
promptly
that
the
papers
were
ready
by
the
day
she
was
twenty
that
anniversary
was
the
last
pleasure
of
the
old
doctor
who
seized
perhaps
with
a
presentiment
of
his
end
gave
a
little
ball
to
which
he
invited
all
the
young
people
in
the
families
of
dionis
cremiere
minoret
and
massin
savinien
bongrand
the
abbe
and
his
two
assistant
priests
the
nemours
doctor
and
mesdames
zelie
minoret
massin
and
cremiere
together
with
old
schmucke
were
the
guests
at
a
grand
dinner
which
preceded
the
ball
i
feel
i
am
going
said
the
old
man
to
the
notary
towards
the
close
of
the
evening
i
beg
you
to
come
and
draw
up
my
guardianship
account
with
ursula
so
as
not
to
complicate
my
property
after
my
death
thank
god
i
have
not
withdrawn
one
penny
from
my
heirs
i
have
disposed
of
nothing
but
my
income
messieurs
cremiere
massin
and
minoret
my
nephew
are
members
of
the
family
council
appointed
for
ursula
and
i
wish
them
to
be
present
at
the
rendering
of
my
these
words
heard
by
massin
and
quickly
passed
from
one
to
another
round
the
poured
balm
into
the
minds
of
the
three
families
who
had
lived
in
perpetual
alternations
of
hope
and
fear
sometimes
thinking
they
were
certain
of
wealth
oftener
that
they
were
disinherited
when
about
two
in
the
morning
the
guests
were
all
gone
and
no
one
remained
in
the
salon
but
savinien
bongrand
and
the
abbe
the
old
doctor
said
pointing
to
ursula
who
was
charming
in
her
ball
dress
to
you
my
friends
i
confide
her
a
few
days
more
and
i
shall
be
here
no
longer
to
protect
her
put
yourselves
between
her
and
the
world
until
she
is
married
i
fear
for
the
words
made
a
painful
impression
the
guardian
s
account
rendered
a
day
or
two
later
in
presence
of
the
family
council
showed
that
doctor
minoret
owed
a
balance
to
his
ward
of
ten
thousand
six
hundred
francs
from
the
bequest
of
monsieur
de
jordy
and
also
from
a
little
capital
of
gifts
made
by
the
doctor
himself
to
ursula
during
the
last
fifteen
years
on
birthdays
and
other
anniversaries
this
formal
rendering
of
the
account
was
insisted
on
by
the
justice
of
the
peace
who
feared
unhappily
with
too
much
reason
the
results
of
doctor
minoret
s
death
the
following
day
the
old
man
was
seized
with
a
weakness
which
compelled
him
to
keep
his
bed
in
spite
of
the
reserve
which
always
surrounded
the
doctor
s
house
and
kept
it
from
observation
the
news
of
his
approaching
death
spread
through
the
town
and
the
heirs
began
to
run
hither
and
thither
through
the
streets
like
the
pearls
of
a
chaplet
when
the
string
is
broken
massin
called
at
the
house
to
learn
the
truth
and
was
told
by
ursula
herself
that
the
doctor
was
in
bed
the
nemours
doctor
had
remarked
that
whenever
old
minoret
took
to
his
bed
he
would
die
and
therefore
in
spite
of
the
cold
the
heirs
took
their
stand
in
the
street
on
the
square
at
their
own
doorsteps
talking
of
the
event
so
long
looked
for
and
watching
for
the
moment
when
the
priests
should
appear
bearing
the
sacrament
with
all
the
paraphernalia
customary
in
the
provinces
to
the
dying
man
accordingly
two
days
later
when
the
abbe
chaperon
with
an
assistant
and
the
preceded
by
the
sacristan
bearing
the
cross
passed
along
the
grand
rue
all
the
heirs
joined
the
procession
to
get
an
entrance
to
the
house
and
see
that
nothing
was
abstracted
and
lay
their
eager
hands
upon
its
coveted
treasures
at
the
earliest
moment
when
the
doctor
saw
behind
the
clergy
the
row
of
kneeling
heirs
who
instead
of
praying
were
looking
at
him
with
eyes
that
were
brighter
than
the
tapers
he
could
not
restrain
a
smile
the
abbe
turned
round
saw
them
and
continued
to
say
the
prayers
slowly
the
post
master
was
the
first
to
abandon
the
kneeling
posture
his
wife
followed
him
massin
fearing
that
zelie
and
her
husband
might
lay
hands
on
some
ornament
joined
them
in
the
salon
where
all
the
heirs
were
presently
assembled
one
by
one
he
is
too
honest
a
man
to
steal
extreme
unction
said
cremiere
we
may
be
sure
of
his
death
yes
we
shall
each
get
about
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
replied
madame

i
have
an
idea
said
zelie
that
for
the
last
three
years
he
hasn

anything
he
grew
fond
of
perhaps
the
money
is
in
the
cellar
whispered
massin
to
cremiere
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
find
it
said
but
after
what
he
said
at
the
ball
we
can
t
have
any
doubt
cried
madame
massin
in
any
case
began
cremiere
how
shall
we
manage
shall
we
divide
shall
we
go
to
law
or
could
we
draw
lots
we
are
adults
you
know
a
discussion
which
soon
became
angry
now
arose
as
to
the
method
of
procedure
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
a
perfect
uproar
of
voices
zelie
s
screeching
organ
detaching
itself
from
the
rest
resounded
in
the
courtyard
and
even
in
the
street
the
noise
reached
the
doctor
s
ears
he
heard
the
words
the
house
the
house
is
worth
thirty
thousand
francs
i
ll
take
it
at
that
said
or
rather
bellowed
by
cremiere
well
we
ll
take
what
it
s
worth
said
zelie
sharply
monsieur
l
abbe
said
the
old
man
to
the
priest
who
remained
beside
his
friend
after
administering
the
communion
help
me
to
die
in
peace
my
heirs
like
those
of
cardinal
ximenes
are
capable
of
pillaging
the
house
before
my
death
and
i
have
no
monkey
to
revive
me
go
and
tell
them
i
will
have
none
of
them
in
my
the
priest
and
the
doctor
of
the
town
went
downstairs
and
repeated
the
message
of
the
dying
man
adding
in
their
indignation
strong
words
of
their
own
madame
bougival
said
the
doctor
close
the
iron
gate
and
allow
no
one
to
enter
even
the
dying
it
seems
can
have
no
peace
prepare
mustard
poultices
and
apply
them
to
the
soles
of
monsieur
s
your
uncle
is
not
dead
said
the
abbe
and
he
may
live
some
time
longer
he
wishes
for
absolute
silence
and
no
one
beside
him
but
his
niece
what
a
difference
between
the
conduct
of
that
young
girl
and
yours
old
hypocrite
exclaimed
cremiere
i
shall
keep
watch
of
him
it
is
possible
he
s
plotting
something
against
our
the
post
master
had
already
disappeared
into
the
garden
intending
to
watch
there
and
wait
his
chance
to
be
admitted
to
the
house
as
an
assistant
he
now
returned
to
it
very
softly
his
boots
making
no
noise
for
there
were
carpets
on
the
stairs
and
corridors
he
was
able
to
reach
the
door
of
his
uncle
s
room
without
being
heard
the
abbe
and
the
doctor
had
left
the
house
la
bougival
was
making
the
poultices
are
we
quite
alone
said
the
old
man
to
his
godchild
ursula
stood
on
tiptoe
and
looked
into
the
courtyard
yes
she
said
the
abbe
has
just
closed
the
gate
after
my
darling
child
said
the
dying
man
my
hours
my
minutes
even
are
counted
i
have
not
been
a
doctor
for
nothing
i
shall
not
last
till
evening
do
not
cry
my
ursula
he
said
fearing
to
be
interrupted
by
the
child
s
weeping
but
listen
to
me
carefully
it
concerns
your
marriage
to
savinien
as
soon
as
la
bougival
comes
back
go
down
to
the
pagoda
here
is
the
key
lift
the
marble
top
of
the
boule
buffet
and
you
will
find
a
letter
beneath
it
sealed
and
addressed
to
you
take
it
and
come
back
here
for
i
can
not
die
easy
unless
i
see
it
in
your
hands
when
i
am
dead
do
not
let
any
one
know
of
it
immediately
but
send
for
monsieur
de
portenduere
read
the
letter
together
swear
to
me
now
in
his
name
and
your
own
that
you
will
carry
out
my
last
wishes
when
savinien
has
obeyed
me
then
announce
my
death
but
not
till
then
the
comedy
of
the
heirs
will
begin
god
grant
those
monsters
may
not
yes
the
post
master
did
not
listen
to
the
end
of
this
scene
he
slipped
away
on
remembering
that
the
lock
of
the
study
was
on
the
library
side
of
the
door
he
had
been
present
in
former
days
at
an
argument
between
the
architect
and
a
locksmith
the
latter
declaring
that
if
the
pagoda
were
entered
by
the
window
on
the
river
it
would
be
much
safer
to
put
the
lock
of
the
door
opening
into
the
library
on
the
library
side
dazzled
by
his
hopes
and
his
ears
flushed
with
blood
minoret
sprang
the
lock
with
the
point
of
his
knife
as
rapidly
as
a
burglar
could
have
done
it
he
entered
the
study
followed
the
doctor
s
directions
took
the
package
of
papers
without
opening
it
relocked
the
door
put
everything
in
order
and
went
into
the
and
sat
down
waiting
till
la
bougival
had
gone
upstairs
with
the
poultice
before
he
ventured
to
leave
the
house
he
then
made
his
escape
all
the
more
easily
because
poor
ursula
lingered
to
see
that
la
bougival
applied
the
poultice
properly
the
letter
the
letter
cried
the
old
man
in
a
dying
voice
obey
me
take
the
key
i
must
see
you
with
that
letter
in
your
the
words
were
said
with
so
wild
a
look
that
la
bougival
exclaimed
to
ursula
do
what
he
asks
at
once
or
you
will
kill
she
kissed
his
forehead
took
the
key
and
went
down
a
moment
later
recalled
by
a
cry
from
la
bougival
she
ran
back
the
old
man
looked
at
her
eagerly
seeing
her
hands
empty
he
rose
in
his
bed
tried
to
speak
and
died
with
a
horrible
gasp
his
eyes
haggard
with
fear
the
poor
girl
who
saw
death
for
the
first
time
fell
on
her
knees
and
burst
into
tears
la
bougival
closed
the
old
man
s
eyes
and
straightened
him
on
the
bed
then
she
ran
to
call
savinien
but
the
heirs
who
stood
at
the
corner
of
the
street
like
crows
watching
till
a
horse
is
buried
before
they
scratch
at
the
ground
and
turn
it
over
with
beak
and
claw
flocked
in
with
the
celerity
of
birds
of
prey
chapter
xv
the
doctor
s
will
while
these
events
were
taking
place
the
post
master
had
hurried
home
to
open
the
mysterious
package
and
know
its
contents
to
my
dear
ursula
mirouet
daughter
of
my
natural
joseph
mirouet
and
dinah
grollman
my
dear
angel
the
fatherly
affection
i
bear
you
and
which
you
have
so
fully
justified
came
not
only
from
the
promise
i
gave
your
father
to
take
his
place
but
also
from
your
resemblance
to
my
wife
ursula
mirouet
whose
grace
intelligence
frankness
and
charm
you
constantly
recall
to
my
mind
your
position
as
the
daughter
of
a
natural
son
of
my
might
invalidate
all
testamentary
bequests
made
by
me
in
your
favor
the
old
rascal
cried
the
post
master
had
i
adopted
you
the
result
might
also
have
been
a
lawsuit
and
i
shrank
from
the
idea
of
transmitting
my
fortune
to
you
by
marriage
for
i
might
live
years
and
thus
interfere
with
your
happiness
which
is
now
delayed
only
by
madame
de
portenduere
having
weighted
these
difficulties
carefully
and
wishing
to
leave
you
enough
money
to
secure
to
you
a
prosperous
existence
the
scoundrel
he
has
thought
of
everything
without
injuring
my
heirs
the
jesuit
as
if
he
did
not
owe
us
every
penny
of
his
money
i
intend
you
to
have
the
savings
from
my
income
which
i
have
for
the
last
eighteen
years
steadily
invested
by
the
help
of
my
notary
seeking
to
make
you
thereby
as
happy
as
any
one
can
be
made
by
riches
without
means
your
education
and
your
lofty
ideas
would
cause
you
unhappiness
besides
you
ought
to
bring
a
liberal
dowry
to
the
fine
young
man
who
loves
you
you
will
therefore
find
in
the
middle
of
the
third
volume
of
pandects
folio
bound
in
red
morocco
the
last
volume
on
the
first
shelf
above
the
little
table

the
library

the
side
of
the
room
next
the
salon
three
certificates
of
funds
in
the
made
out
to
bearer
each
amounting
to
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
what
depths
of
wickedness
screamed
the
post
master
ah
god
would
not
permit
me
to
be
so
take
these
at
once
and
also
some
uninvested
savings
made
to
this
date
which
you
will
find
in
the
preceding
volume
remember
my
darling
child
that
you
must
obey
a
wish
that
has
made
the
happiness
of
my
whole
life
a
wish
that
will
force
me
to
ask
the
intervention
of
god
should
you
disobey
me
but
to
guard
against
all
scruples
in
your
dear
conscience
for
i
well
know
how
ready
it
is
to
torture
you
you
will
find
herewith
a
will
in
due
form
bequeathing
these
certificates
to
monsieur
savinien
de
portenduere
so
whether
you
possess
them
in
your
own
name
or
whether
they
come
to
you
from
him
you
love
they
will
be
in
every
sense
your
legitimate
property
your
godfather

minoret
to
this
letter
was
annexed
the
following
paper
written
on
a
sheet
of
stamped
paper
this
is
my
will
i
denis
minoret
doctor
of
medicine
settled
in
nemours
being
of
sound
mind
and
body
as
the
date
of
this
document
will
show
do
bequeath
my
soul
to
god
imploring
him
to
pardon
my
errors
in
view
of
my
sincere
repentance
next
having
found
in
monsieur
le
vicomte
savinien
de
portenduere
a
true
and
honest
affection
for
me
i
bequeath
to
him
the
sum
of
thousand
francs
a
year
from
the
funds
at
three
per
cent
the
said
bequest
to
take
precedence
of
all
inheritance
accruing
to
my
heirs
written
by
my
own
hand
at
nemours
on
the
of
january
denis
minoret
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
the
post
master
who
had
locked
himself
into
his
wife
s
bedroom
to
insure
being
alone
looked
about
for
the
and
received
two
warnings
from
heaven
by
the
extinction
of
two
matches
which
obstinately
refused
to
light
the
third
took
fire
he
burned
the
letter
and
the
will
on
the
hearth
and
buried
the
vestiges
of
paper
and
in
the
ashes
by
way
of
superfluous
caution
then
allured
by
the
thought
of
possessing
thousand
francs
a
year
of
which
his
wife
knew
nothing
he
returned
at
full
speed
to
his
uncle
s
house
spurred
by
the
only
idea
a
simple
idea
which
was
able
to
piece
and
penetrate
his
dull
brain
finding
the
house
invaded
by
the
three
families
now
masters
of
the
place
he
trembled
lest
he
should
be
unable
to
accomplish
a
project
to
which
he
gave
no
reflection
whatever
except
so
far
as
to
fear
the
obstacles
what
are
you
doing
here
he
said
to
massin
and
cremiere
we
can
t
leave
the
house
and
the
property
to
be
pillaged
we
are
the
heirs
but
we
can
t
camp
here
you
cremiere
go
to
dionis
at
once
and
tell
him
to
come
and
certify
to
the
death
i
can
t
draw
up
the
mortuary
certificate
for
an
uncle
though
i
am
you
massin
go
and
ask
old
bongrand
to
attach
the
seals
as
for
you
ladies
he
added
turning
to
his
wife
and
mesdames
cremiere
and
massin
go
and
look
after
ursula
then
nothing
can
be
stolen
above
all
close
the
iron
gate
and
don
t
let
any
one
leave
the
the
women
who
felt
the
justice
of
this
remark
ran
to
ursula
s
bedroom
where
they
found
the
noble
girl
so
cruelly
suspected
on
her
knees
before
god
her
face
covered
with
tears
minoret
suspecting
that
the
women
would
not
long
remain
with
ursula
went
at
once
to
the
library
found
the
volume
opened
it
took
the
three
certificates
and
found
in
the
other
volume
about
thirty
bank
notes
in
spite
of
his
brutal
nature
the
colossus
felt
as
though
a
peal
of
bells
were
ringing
in
each
ear
the
blood
whistled
in
his
temples
as
he
committed
the
theft
cold
as
the
weather
was
his
shirt
was
wet
on
his
back
his
legs
gave
way
under
him
and
he
fell
into
a
chair
in
the
salon
as
if
an
axe
had
fallen
on
his
head
how
the
inheritance
of
money
loosens
a
man
s
tongue
did
you
hear
minoret
said
massin
to
cremiere
as
they
hurried
through
the
town
go
here
go
there
just
as
if
he
knew
yes
for
a
dull
beast
like
him
he
had
a
certain
air
of
stop
said
massin
alarmed
at
a
sudden
thought
his
wife
is
there
they
ve
got
some
plan
do
you
do
both
errands
i
ll
go
just
as
the
post
master
fell
into
the
chair
he
saw
at
the
gate
the
heated
face
of
the
clerk
of
the
court
who
returned
to
the
house
of
death
with
the
celerity
of
a
weasel
well
what
is
it
now
asked
the
post
master
unlocking
the
gate
for
his
nothing
i
have
come
back
to
be
present
at
the
sealing
answered
massin
giving
him
a
savage
look
i
wish
those
seals
were
already
on
so
that
we
could
go
home
said
minoret
we
shall
have
to
put
a
watcher
over
them
said
massin
la
bougival
is
capable
of
anything
in
the
interests
of
that
minx
we
ll
put
goupil
goupil
said
the
post
master
put
a
rat
in
the
meal
well
let
s
consider
returned
massin
they
ll
watch
the
body
the
seals
can
be
affixed
in
an
hour
our
wives
could
look
after
them
we
ll
have
the
funeral
at
twelve
o
clock
but
the
inventory
can
t
be
made
under
a
let
s
get
rid
of
that
girl
at
once
said
the
colossus
then
we
can
safely
leave
the
watchman
of
the
to
look
after
the
house
and
the
good
cried
massin
you

the
head
of
the
minoret
ladies
said
minoret
be
good
enough
to
stay
in
the
salon
we
can
t
think
of
our
dinner
the
seals
must
be
put
on
at
once
for
the
security
of
all
he
took
his
wife
apart
and
told
her
massin
s
proposition
about
ursula
the
women
whose
hearts
were
full
of
vengeance
against
the
minx
as
they
called
her
hailed
the
idea
of
turning
her
out
bongrand
arrived
with
his
assistants
to
apply
the
seals
and
was
indignant
when
the
request
was
made
to
him
by
zelie
and
madame
massin
as
a
near
friend
of
the
deceased
to
tell
ursula
to
leave
the
house
go
and
turn
her
out
of
her
father
s
house
her
benefactor
s
house
yourselves
he
cried
go
you
who
owe
your
inheritance
to
the
generosity
of
her
soul
take
her
by
the
shoulders
and
fling
her
into
the
street
before
the
eyes
of
the
whole
town
you
think
her
capable
of
robbing
you
well
appoint
a
watcher
of
the
seals
you
have
a
right
to
do
that
but
i
tell
you
at
once
i
shall
put
no
seals
on
ursula
s
room
she
has
a
right
to
that
room
and
everything
in
it
is
her
own
property
i
shall
tell
her
what
her
rights
are
and
tell
her
too
to
put
everything
that
belongs
to
her
in
this
house
in
that
room
oh
in
your
presence
he
said
hearing
a
growl
of
dissatisfaction
among
the
heirs
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
the
collector
to
the
post
master
and
the
women
who
seemed
stupefied
by
the
angry
address
of
bongrand
call
a
magistrate
cried
the
post
master
ursula
meanwhile
was
sitting
on
her
little
sofa
in
a
condition
her
head
thrown
back
her
braids
unfastened
while
every
now
and
then
her
sobs
broke
forth
her
eyes
were
dim
and
their
lids
swollen
she
was
in
fact
in
a
state
of
moral
and
physical
prostration
which
might
have
softened
the
hardest
hearts
except
those
of
the
heirs
ah
monsieur
bongrand
after
my
happy
birthday
comes
death
and
mourning
she
said
with
the
poetry
natural
to
her
you
know
what
he
was
in
twenty
years
he
never
said
an
impatient
word
to
me
i
believed
he
would
live
a
hundred
years
he
has
been
my
mother
she
cried
my
good
kind
these
simple
thoughts
brought
torrents
of
tears
from
her
eyes
interrupted
by
sobs
then
she
fell
back
exhausted
my
child
said
the
justice
of
peace
hearing
the
heirs
on
the
staircase
you
have
a
lifetime
before
you
in
which
to
weep
but
you
have
now
only
a
moment
to
attend
to
your
interests
gather
everything
that
belongs
to
you
in
this
house
and
put
it
into
your
own
room
at
once
the
heirs
insist
on
my
affixing
the
ah
his
heirs
may
take
everything
if
they
choose
cried
ursula
sitting
upright
under
an
impulse
of
savage
indignation
i
have
something
here
she
added
striking
her
breast
which
is
far
more
precious
what
is
it
said
the
post
master
who
with
massin
at
his
heels
now
showed
his
brutal
face
the
remembrances
of
his
virtues
of
his
life
of
his
words
an
image
of
his
celestial
soul
she
said
her
eyes
and
face
glowing
as
she
raised
her
hand
with
a
glorious
gesture
and
a
key
cried
massin
creeping
up
to
her
like
a
cat
and
seizing
a
key
which
fell
from
the
bosom
of
her
dress
in
her
sudden
movement
yes
she
said
blushing
that
is
the
key
of
his
study
he
sent
me
there
at
the
moment
he
was
the
two
men
glanced
at
each
other
with
horrid
smiles
and
then
at
monsieur
bongrand
with
a
meaning
look
of
degrading
suspicion
ursula
who
intercepted
it
rose
to
her
feet
pale
as
if
the
blood
had
left
her
body
her
eyes
sent
forth
the
lightnings
that
perhaps
can
issue
only
at
some
cost
of
life
as
she
said
in
a
choking
voice
monsieur
bongrand
everything
in
this
room
is
mine
through
the
kindness
of
my
godfather
they
may
have
it
all
i
have
nothing
on
me
but
the
clothes
i
wear
i
shall
leave
the
house
and
never
return
to
she
went
to
her
godfather
s
room
and
no
entreaties
could
make
her
leave
it
the
heirs
who
now
began
to
be
slightly
ashamed
of
their
conduct
endeavoring
to
persuade
her
she
requested
monsieur
bongrand
to
engage
two
rooms
for
her
at
the
vieille
poste
inn
until
she
could
find
some
lodging
in
town
where
she
could
live
with
la
bougival
she
returned
to
her
own
room
for
her
and
spent
the
night
with
the
abbe
his
assistant
and
savinien
in
weeping
and
praying
beside
her
uncle
s
body
savinien
came
after
his
mother
had
gone
to
bed
and
knelt
without
a
word
beside
his
ursula
she
smiled
at
him
sadly
and
thanked
him
for
coming
faithfully
to
share
her
troubles
my
child
said
monsieur
bongrand
bring
her
a
large
package
one
of
your
uncle
s
heirs
has
taken
these
necessary
articles
from
your
drawers
for
the
seals
can
not
be
opened
for
several
days
after
that
you
will
recover
everything
that
belongs
to
you
i
have
for
your
own
sake
placed
the
seals
on
your
thank
you
she
replied
pressing
his
hand
look
at
him
again
he
seems
to
sleep
does
he
not
the
old
man
s
face
wore
that
flower
of
fleeting
beauty
which
rests
upon
the
features
of
the
dead
who
die
a
painless
death
light
appeared
to
radiate
from
it
did
he
give
you
anything
secretly
before
he
died
whispered
bongrand
nothing
she
said
he
spoke
only
of
a
good
it
will
certainly
be
found
said
bongrand
how
fortunate
for
you
that
the
heirs
demanded
the
at
daybreak
ursula
bade
adieu
to
the
house
where
her
happy
youth
was
passed
more
particularly
to
the
modest
chamber
in
which
her
love
began
so
dear
to
her
was
it
that
even
in
this
hour
of
darkest
grief
tears
of
regret
rolled
down
her
face
for
the
dear
and
peaceful
haven
with
one
last
glance
at
savinien
s
windows
she
left
the
room
and
the
house
and
went
to
the
inn
accompanied
by
la
bougival
who
carried
the
package
by
monsieur
bongrand
who
gave
her
his
arm
and
by
savinien
her
true
protector
thus
it
happened
that
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
and
cautions
the
worst
fears
of
the
justice
of
peace
were
realized
he
was
now
to
see
ursula
without
means
and
at
the
mercy
of
her
benefactor
s
heirs
the
next
afternoon
the
whole
town
attended
the
doctor
s
funeral
when
the
conduct
of
the
heirs
to
his
adopted
daughter
was
publicly
known
a
vast
majority
of
the
people
thought
it
natural
and
necessary
an
inheritance
was
involved
the
good
man
was
known
to
have
hoarded
ursula
might
think
she
had
rights
the
heirs
were
only
defending
their
property
she
had
humbled
them
enough
during
their
uncle
s
lifetime
for
he
had
treated
them
like
dogs
and
sent
them
about
their
business
desire
minoret
who
was
not
going
to
do
wonders
in
life
so
said
those
who
envied
his
father
came
down
for
the
funeral
ursula
was
unable
to
be
present
for
she
was
in
bed
with
a
nervous
fever
caused
partly
by
the
insults
of
the
heirs
and
partly
by
her
heavy
affliction
look
at
that
hypocrite
weeping
said
some
of
the
heirs
pointing
to
savinien
who
was
deeply
affected
by
the
doctor
s
death
the
question
is
said
goupil
has
he
any
good
grounds
for
weeping
don
t
laugh
too
soon
my
friends
the
seals
are
not
yet
pooh
said
minoret
who
had
good
reason
to
know
the
truth
you
are
always
frightening
us
about
as
the
funeral
procession
left
the
church
to
proceed
to
the
cemetery
a
bitter
mortification
was
inflicted
on
goupil
he
tried
to
take
desire
s
arm
but
the
latter
withdrew
it
and
turned
away
from
his
former
comrade
in
presence
of
all
nemours
i
won
t
be
angry
or
i
couldn
t
get
revenge
thought
the
notary
s
clerk
whose
dry
heart
swelled
in
his
bosom
like
a
sponge
before
breaking
the
seals
and
making
the
inventory
it
took
some
time
for
the
procureur
du
roi
who
is
the
legal
guardian
of
orphans
to
commission
monsieur
bongrand
to
act
in
his
place
after
that
was
done
the
settlement
of
the
minoret
inheritance
nothing
else
being
talked
of
in
the
town
for
ten
days
began
with
all
the
legal
formalities
dionis
had
his
pickings
goupil
enjoyed
some
and
as
the
business
was
profitable
the
sessions
were
many
after
the
first
of
these
sessions
all
parties
breakfasted
together
notary
clerk
heirs
and
witnesses
drank
the
best
wines
in
the
doctor
s
cellar
in
the
provinces
and
especially
in
little
towns
where
every
one
lives
in
his
own
house
it
is
sometimes
very
difficult
to
find
a
lodging
when
a
man
buys
a
business
of
any
kind
the
is
almost
always
included
in
the
purchase
monsieur
bongrand
saw
no
other
way
of
removing
ursula
from
the
village
inn
than
to
buy
a
small
house
on
the
grand
rue
at
the
corner
of
the
bridge
over
the
loing
the
little
building
had
a
front
door
opening
on
a
corridor
and
one
room
on
the
with
two
windows
on
the
street
behind
this
came
the
kitchen
with
a
glass
door
opening
to
an
inner
courtyard
about
thirty
feet
square
a
small
staircase
lighted
on
the
side
towards
the
river
by
small
windows
led
to
the
first
floor
where
there
were
three
chambers
and
above
these
were
two
attic
rooms
monsieur
bongrand
borrowed
two
thousand
francs
from
la
bougival
s
savings
to
pay
the
first
instalment
of
the
price
six
thousand
francs
and
obtained
good
terms
for
payment
of
the
rest
as
ursula
wished
to
buy
her
uncle
s
books
bongrand
knocked
down
the
partition
between
two
rooms
on
the
bedroom
floor
finding
that
their
united
length
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
doctor
s
library
and
gave
room
for
his
bookshelves
savinien
and
bongrand
urged
on
the
workmen
who
were
cleaning
painting
and
otherwise
renewing
the
tiny
place
so
that
before
the
end
of
march
ursula
was
able
to
leave
the
inn
and
take
up
her
abode
in
the
ugly
house
where
however
she
found
a
bedroom
exactly
like
the
one
she
had
left
for
it
was
filled
with
all
her
furniture
claimed
by
the
justice
of
peace
when
the
seals
were
removed
la
bougival
sleeping
in
the
attic
could
be
summoned
by
a
bell
placed
near
the
head
of
the
young
girl
s
bed
the
room
intended
for
the
books
the
salon
on
the
and
the
kitchen
though
still
unfurnished
had
been
hung
with
fresh
papers
and
repainted
and
only
awaited
the
purchases
which
the
young
girl
hoped
to
make
when
her
godfather
s
effects
were
sold
though
the
strength
of
ursula
s
character
was
well
known
to
the
abbe
and
monsieur
bongrand
they
both
feared
the
sudden
change
from
the
comfort
and
elegancies
to
which
her
uncle
had
accustomed
her
to
this
barren
and
denuded
life
as
for
savinien
he
wept
over
it
he
did
in
fact
make
private
payments
to
the
workman
and
to
the
upholsterer
so
that
ursula
should
perceive
no
difference
between
the
new
chamber
and
the
old
one
but
the
young
girl
herself
whose
happiness
now
lay
in
savinien
s
own
eyes
showed
the
gentlest
resignation
which
endeared
her
more
and
more
to
her
two
old
friends
and
proved
to
them
for
the
hundredth
time
that
no
troubles
but
those
of
the
heart
could
make
her
suffer
the
grief
she
felt
for
the
loss
of
her
godfather
was
far
too
deep
to
let
her
even
feel
the
bitterness
of
her
change
of
fortune
though
it
added
fresh
obstacles
to
her
marriage
savinien
s
distress
in
seeing
her
thus
reduced
did
her
so
much
harm
that
she
whispered
to
him
as
they
came
from
mass
on
the
morning
on
the
day
when
she
first
went
to
live
in
her
new
house
love
could
not
exist
without
patience
let
us
as
soon
as
the
form
of
the
inventory
was
drawn
up
massin
advised
by
goupil
who
turned
to
him
under
the
influence
of
his
secret
hatred
to
the
post
master
summoned
monsieur
and
madame
de
portenduere
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
which
had
now
elapsed
together
with
the
interest
accruing
thereon
the
old
lady
was
bewildered
at
a
summons
to
pay
one
hundred
and
thousand
five
hundred
and
seventeen
francs
within
hours
under
pain
of
execution
on
her
house
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
borrow
the
money
savinien
went
to
fontainebleau
to
consult
a
lawyer
you
are
dealing
with
a
bad
set
of
people
who
will
not
compromise
was
the
lawyer
s
opinion
they
intend
to
sue
in
the
matter
and
get
your
farm
at
bordieres
the
best
way
for
you
would
be
to
make
a
voluntary
sale
of
it
and
so
escape
this
dreadful
news
broke
down
the
old
lady
her
son
very
gently
pointed
out
to
her
that
had
she
consented
to
his
marriage
in
minoret
s
the
doctor
would
have
left
his
property
to
ursula
s
husband
and
they
would
have
been
opulent
instead
of
being
as
they
now
were
in
the
depths
of
poverty
though
said
without
reproach
this
argument
annihilated
the
poor
woman
even
more
than
the
thought
of
her
coming
ejectment
when
ursula
heard
of
this
catastrophe
she
was
stupefied
with
grief
having
scarcely
recovered
from
her
fever
and
the
blow
which
the
heirs
had
already
dealt
her
to
love
and
be
unable
to
succor
the
man
she
loves
that
is
one
of
the
most
dreadful
of
all
sufferings
to
the
soul
of
a
noble
and
sensitive
woman
i
wished
to
buy
my
uncle
s
house
she
said
now
i
will
buy
your
mother
can
you
said
savinien
you
are
a
minor
and
you
can
not
sell
out
your
funds
without
formalities
to
which
the
procureur
du
roi
now
your
legal
guardian
would
not
agree
we
shall
not
resist
the
whole
town
will
be
glad
to
see
the
discomfiture
of
a
noble
family
these
bourgeois
are
like
hounds
after
a
quarry
fortunately
i
still
have
ten
thousand
francs
left
on
which
i
can
support
my
mother
till
this
deplorable
matter
is
settled
besides
the
inventory
of
your
godfather
s
property
is
not
yet
finished
monsieur
bongrand
still
thinks
he
shall
find
something
for
you
he
is
as
much
astonished
as
i
am
that
you
seem
to
be
left
without
fortune
the
doctor
so
often
spoke
both
to
him
and
to
me
of
the
future
he
had
prepared
for
you
that
neither
of
us
can
understand
this
pooh
she
said
so
long
as
i
can
buy
my
godfather
s
books
and
furniture
and
prevent
their
being
dispersed
i
am
but
who
knows
the
price
these
infamous
creatures
will
set
on
anything
you
want
nothing
was
talked
of
from
montargis
to
fontainebleau
but
the
million
for
which
the
minoret
heirs
were
searching
but
the
most
minute
search
made
in
every
corner
of
the
house
after
the
seals
were
removed
brought
no
discovery
the
one
hundred
and
thousand
francs
of
the
portenduere
debt
the
capital
of
the
fifteen
thousand
a
year
in
the
three
per
cents
then
quoted
at
the
house
valued
at
forty
thousand
francs
and
its
handsome
furniture
produced
a
total
of
about
six
hundred
thousand
francs
which
to
most
persons
seemed
a
comforting
sum
but
what
had
become
of
the
money
the
doctor
must
have
saved
minoret
began
to
have
gnawing
anxieties
la
bougival
and
savinien
who
persisted
in
believing
as
did
the
justice
of
peace
in
the
existence
of
a
will
came
every
day
at
the
close
of
each
session
to
find
out
from
bongrand
the
results
of
the
day
s
search
the
latter
would
sometimes
exclaim
before
the
agents
and
the
heirs
were
fairly
out
of
hearing
i
can
t
understand
the
thing
bongrand
savinien
and
the
abbe
often
declared
to
each
other
that
the
doctor
who
received
no
interest
from
the
portenduere
loan
could
not
have
kept
his
house
as
he
did
on
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
this
opinion
openly
expressed
made
the
post
master
turn
livid
more
than
once
yet
they
and
i
have
rummaged
everywhere
said
bongrand
they
to
find
money
and
i
to
find
a
will
in
favor
of
monsieur
de
portenduere
they
have
sifted
the
ashes
lifted
the
marbles
felt
of
the
slippers
bored
into
the
of
the
beds
emptied
the
mattresses
ripped
up
the
quilts
turned
his
examined
every
inch
of
paper
piece
by
piece
searched
the
drawers
dug
up
the
cellar
floor
and
i
have
urged
on
their
what
do
you
think
about
it
said
the
abbe
the
will
has
been
suppressed
by
one
of
the
but
where
s
the
property
we
may
whistle
for
it
perhaps
the
will
is
hidden
in
the
library
said
savinien
yes
and
for
that
reason
i
don
t
dissuade
ursula
from
buying
it
if
it
were
not
for
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
let
her
put
every
penny
of
her
ready
money
into
books
she
will
never
at
first
the
whole
town
believed
the
doctor
s
niece
had
got
possession
of
the
unfound
capital
but
when
it
was
known
positively
that
fourteen
hundred
francs
a
year
and
her
gifts
constituted
her
whole
fortune
the
search
of
the
doctor
s
house
and
furniture
excited
a
more
curiosity
than
before
some
said
the
money
would
be
found
in
bank
bills
hidden
away
in
the
furniture
others
that
the
old
man
had
slipped
them
into
his
books
the
sale
of
the
effects
exhibited
a
spectacle
of
the
most
extraordinary
precautions
on
the
part
of
the
heirs
dionis
who
was
doing
duty
as
auctioneeer
declared
as
each
lot
was
cried
out
that
the
heirs
only
sold
the
article
whatever
it
was
and
not
what
it
might
contain
then
before
allowing
it
to
be
taken
away
it
was
subjected
to
a
final
investigation
being
thumped
and
sounded
and
when
at
last
it
left
the
house
the
sellers
followed
with
the
looks
a
father
might
cast
upon
a
son
who
was
starting
for
india
ah
mademoiselle
cried
la
bougival
returning
from
the
first
session
in
despair
i
shall
not
go
again
monsieur
bongrand
is
right
you
could
never
bear
the
sight
everything
is
ticketed
all
the
town
is
coming
and
going
just
as
in
the
street
the
handsome
furniture
is
being
ruined
they
even
stand
upon
it
the
whole
place
is
such
a
muddle
that
a
hen
couldn
t
find
her
chicks
you
d
think
there
had
been
a
fire
lots
of
things
are
in
the
courtyard
the
closets
are
all
open
and
nothing
in
them
oh
the
poor
dear
man
it
s
well
he
died
the
sight
would
have
killed
bongrand
who
bought
for
ursula
certain
articles
which
her
uncle
cherished
and
which
were
suitable
for
her
little
house
did
not
appear
at
the
sale
of
the
library
shrewder
than
the
heirs
whose
cupidity
might
have
run
up
the
price
of
the
books
had
they
known
he
was
buying
them
for
ursula
he
commissioned
a
dealer
in
old
books
living
in
melun
to
buy
them
for
him
as
a
result
of
the
heir
s
anxiety
the
whole
library
was
sold
book
by
book
three
thousand
volumes
were
examined
one
by
one
held
by
the
two
sides
of
the
binding
and
shaken
so
that
loose
papers
would
infallibly
fall
out
the
whole
amount
of
the
purchases
on
ursula
s
account
amounted
to
six
thousand
five
hundred
francs
or
thereabouts
the
were
not
allowed
to
leave
the
premises
until
carefully
examined
by
a
brought
down
from
paris
to
search
for
secret
drawers
when
at
last
monsieur
bongrand
gave
orders
to
take
the
books
and
the
bookcases
to
mademoiselle
mirouet
s
house
the
heirs
were
tortured
with
vague
fears
not
dissipated
until
in
course
of
time
they
saw
how
poorly
she
lived
minoret
bought
up
his
uncle
s
house
the
value
of
which
his
ran
up
to
fifty
thousand
francs
imagining
that
the
post
master
expected
to
find
a
treasure
in
the
walls
in
fact
the
house
was
sold
with
a
reservation
on
this
subject
two
weeks
later
minoret
disposed
of
his
post
establishment
with
all
the
coaches
and
horses
to
the
son
of
a
rich
farmer
and
went
to
live
in
his
uncle
s
house
where
he
spent
considerable
sums
in
repairing
and
refurnishing
the
rooms
by
making
this
move
he
thoughtlessly
condemned
himself
to
live
within
sight
of
ursula
i
hope
he
said
to
dionis
the
day
when
madame
de
portenduere
was
summoned
to
pay
her
debt
that
we
shall
soon
be
rid
of
those
nobles
after
they
are
gone
we
ll
drive
out
the
that
old
woman
with
fourteen
quarterings
said
goupil
won
t
want
to
witness
her
own
disaster
she
ll
go
and
die
in
brittany
where
she
can
manage
to
find
a
wife
for
her
no
said
the
notary
who
had
that
morning
drawn
out
a
deed
of
sale
at
bongrand
s
request
ursula
has
just
bought
the
house
she
is
living
that
cursed
fool
does
everything
she
can
to
annoy
me
cried
the
post
master
imprudently
what
does
it
signify
to
you
whether
she
lives
in
nemours
or
not
asked
goupil
surprised
at
the
annoyance
which
the
colossus
betrayed
don
t
you
know
answered
minoret
turning
as
red
as
a
poppy
that
my
son
is
fool
enough
to
be
in
love
with
her
i
d
give
five
hundred
francs
if
i
could
get
ursula
out
of
this
chapter
xvi
the
two
adversaries
perhaps
the
foregoing
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
post
master
will
have
shown
already
that
ursula
poor
and
resigned
was
destined
to
be
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
rich
minoret
the
bustle
attending
the
settlement
of
an
estate
the
sale
of
the
property
the
going
and
coming
necessitated
by
such
unusual
business
his
discussions
with
his
wife
about
the
most
trifling
details
the
purchase
of
the
doctor
s
house
where
zelie
wished
to
live
in
bourgeois
style
to
advance
her
son
s
interests
all
this
contrasting
with
his
usually
tranquil
life
hindered
the
huge
minoret
from
thinking
of
his
victim
but
about
the
middle
of
may
a
few
days
after
his
installation
in
the
doctor
s
house
as
he
was
coming
home
from
a
walk
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
piano
saw
la
bougival
sitting
at
a
window
like
a
dragon
guarding
a
treasure
and
suddenly
became
aware
of
an
importunate
voice
within
him
to
explain
why
to
a
man
of
minoret
s
nature
the
sight
of
ursula
who
had
no
suspicion
of
the
theft
committed
upon
her
now
became
intolerable
why
the
spectacle
of
so
much
fortitude
under
misfortune
impelled
him
to
a
desire
to
drive
the
girl
out
of
town
and
how
and
why
it
was
that
this
desire
took
the
form
of
hatred
and
revenge
would
require
a
whole
treatise
on
moral
philosophy
perhaps
he
felt
he
was
not
the
real
possessor
of
thousand
francs
a
year
so
long
as
she
to
whom
they
really
belonged
lived
near
him
perhaps
he
fancied
some
mere
chance
might
betray
his
theft
if
the
person
despoiled
was
not
got
rid
of
perhaps
to
a
nature
in
some
sort
primitive
almost
uncivilized
and
whose
owner
up
to
that
time
had
never
done
anything
illegal
the
presence
of
ursula
awakened
remorse
possibly
this
remorse
goaded
him
the
more
because
he
had
received
his
share
of
the
property
legitimately
acquired
in
his
own
mind
he
no
doubt
attributed
these
stirrings
of
his
conscience
to
the
fact
of
ursula
s
presence
imagining
that
if
she
were
removed
all
his
uncomfortable
feelings
would
disappear
with
her
but
still
after
all
perhaps
crime
has
its
own
doctrine
of
perfection
a
beginning
of
evil
demands
its
end
a
first
stab
must
be
followed
by
the
blow
that
kills
perhaps
robbery
is
doomed
to
lead
to
murder
minoret
had
committed
the
crime
without
the
slightest
reflection
so
rapidly
had
the
events
taken
place
reflection
came
later
now
if
you
have
thoroughly
possessed
yourself
of
this
man
s
nature
and
bodily
presence
you
will
understand
the
mighty
effect
produced
on
him
by
a
thought
remorse
is
more
than
a
thought
it
comes
from
a
feeling
which
can
no
more
be
hidden
than
love
like
love
it
has
its
own
tyranny
but
just
as
minoret
had
committed
the
crime
against
ursula
without
the
slightest
reflection
so
he
now
blindly
longed
to
drive
her
from
nemours
when
he
felt
himself
disturbed
by
the
sight
of
that
wronged
innocence
being
in
a
sense
imbecile
he
never
thought
of
the
consequences
he
went
from
danger
to
danger
driven
by
a
selfish
instinct
like
a
wild
animal
which
does
not
foresee
the
huntsman
s
skill
and
relies
on
its
own
rapidity
or
strength
before
long
the
rich
bourgeois
who
still
met
in
dionis
s
salon
noticed
a
great
change
in
the
manners
and
behavior
of
the
man
who
had
hitherto
been
so
free
of
care
i
don
t
know
what
has
come
to
minoret
he
is
all
said
his
wife
from
whom
he
was
resolved
to
hide
his
daring
deed
everybody
explained
his
condition
as
being
neither
more
nor
less
ennui
in
fact
the
thought
now
expressed
on
his
face
did
resemble
ennui
caused
they
said
by
the
sudden
cessation
of
business
and
the
change
from
an
active
life
to
one
of
leisure
while
minoret
was
thinking
only
of
destroying
ursula
s
life
in
nemours
la
bougival
never
let
a
day
go
by
without
torturing
her
foster
child
with
some
allusion
to
the
fortune
she
ought
to
have
had
or
without
comparing
her
miserable
lot
with
the
prospects
the
doctor
had
promised
and
of
which
he
had
often
spoken
to
her
la
bougival
it
is
not
for
myself
i
speak
she
said
but
is
it
likely
that
monsieur
good
and
kind
as
he
was
would
have
died
without
leaving
me
the
merest
trifle
am
i
not
here
replied
ursula
forbidding
la
bougival
to
say
another
word
on
the
subject
she
could
not
endure
to
soil
the
dear
and
tender
memories
that
surrounded
that
noble
head
a
sketch
of
which
in
black
and
white
hung
in
her
little
salon
with
thoughts
of
selfish
interest
to
her
fresh
and
beautiful
imagination
that
sketch
sufficed
to
make
her
her
godfather
on
whom
her
thoughts
continually
dwelt
all
the
more
because
surrounded
with
the
things
he
loved
and
used
his
large
the
furniture
from
his
study
his
and
the
piano
he
had
chosen
for
her
the
two
old
friends
who
still
remained
to
her
the
abbe
chaperon
and
monsieur
bongrand
the
only
visitors
whom
she
received
were
in
the
midst
of
these
inanimate
objects
representative
of
the
past
like
two
living
memories
of
her
former
life
to
which
she
attached
her
present
by
the
love
her
godfather
had
blessed
after
a
while
the
sadness
of
her
thoughts
softening
gradually
gave
tone
to
the
general
tenor
of
her
life
and
united
all
its
parts
in
an
indefinable
harmony
expressed
by
the
exquisite
neatness
the
exact
symmetry
of
her
room
the
few
flowers
sent
by
savinien
the
dainty
nothings
of
a
young
girl
s
life
the
tranquillity
which
her
quiet
habits
diffused
about
her
giving
peace
and
composure
to
the
little
home
after
breakfast
and
after
mass
she
continued
her
studies
and
practiced
then
she
took
her
embroidery
and
sat
at
the
window
looking
on
the
street
at
four
o
clock
savinien
returning
from
a
walk
which
he
took
in
all
weathers
finding
the
window
open
would
sit
upon
the
outer
casing
and
talk
with
her
for
half
an
hour
in
the
evening
the
abbe
and
monsieur
bongrand
came
to
see
her
but
she
never
allowed
savinien
to
accompany
them
neither
did
she
accept
madame
de
portenduere
s
proposition
which
savinien
had
induced
his
mother
to
make
that
she
should
visit
there
ursula
and
la
bougival
lived
moreover
with
the
strictest
economy
they
did
not
spend
counting
everything
more
than
sixty
francs
a
month
the
old
nurse
was
indefatigable
she
washed
and
ironed
cooked
only
twice
a
week
mistress
and
maid
eating
their
food
cold
on
other
days
for
ursula
was
determined
to
save
the
seven
hundred
francs
still
due
on
the
purchase
of
the
house
this
rigid
conduct
together
with
her
modesty
and
her
resignation
to
a
life
of
poverty
after
the
enjoyment
of
luxury
and
the
fond
indulgence
of
all
her
wishes
deeply
impressed
certain
persons
ursula
won
the
respect
of
others
and
no
voice
was
raised
against
her
even
the
heirs
once
satisfied
did
her
justice
savinien
admired
the
strength
of
character
of
so
young
a
girl
from
time
to
time
madame
de
portenduere
when
they
met
in
church
would
address
a
few
kind
words
to
her
and
twice
she
insisted
on
her
coming
to
dinner
and
fetched
her
herself
if
all
this
was
not
happiness
it
was
at
least
tranquillity
but
a
benefit
which
came
to
ursula
through
the
legal
care
and
ability
of
bongrand
started
the
smouldering
persecution
which
up
to
this
time
had
laid
in
minoret
s
breast
as
a
dumb
desire
as
soon
as
the
legal
settlement
of
the
doctor
s
estate
was
finished
the
justice
of
peace
urged
by
ursula
took
the
cause
of
the
portendueres
in
hand
and
promised
her
to
get
them
out
of
their
trouble
in
dealing
with
the
old
lady
whose
opposition
to
ursula
s
happiness
made
him
furious
he
did
not
allow
her
to
be
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
his
devotion
to
her
service
was
solely
to
give
pleasure
to
mademoiselle
mirouet
he
chose
one
of
his
former
clerks
to
act
for
the
portendueres
at
fontainebleau
and
himself
put
in
a
motion
for
a
stay
of
proceedings
he
intended
to
profit
by
the
interval
which
must
elapse
between
the
stoppage
of
the
present
suit
and
some
new
step
on
the
part
of
massin
to
renew
the
lease
at
six
thousand
francs
get
a
premium
from
the
present
tenants
and
the
payment
in
full
of
the
rent
of
the
current
year
at
this
time
when
these
matters
had
to
be
discussed
the
former
were
again
organized
in
madame
de
portenduere
s
salon
between
himself
the
abbe
savinien
and
ursula
whom
the
abbe
and
he
escorted
there
and
back
every
evening
in
june
bongrand
succeeded
in
quashing
the
proceedings
whereupon
the
new
lease
was
signed
he
obtained
a
premium
of
thousand
francs
from
the
farmer
and
a
rent
of
six
thousand
a
year
for
eighteen
years
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
this
was
finally
settled
he
went
to
see
zelie
whom
he
knew
to
be
puzzled
as
to
how
to
invest
her
money
and
proposed
to
sell
her
the
farm
at
bordieres
for
two
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
i
d
buy
it
at
once
said
minoret
if
i
were
sure
the
portendueres
would
go
and
live
somewhere
why
said
the
justice
of
peace
we
want
to
get
rid
of
the
nobles
in
i
did
hear
the
old
lady
say
that
if
she
could
settle
her
affairs
she
should
go
and
live
in
brittany
as
she
would
not
have
means
enough
left
to
live
here
she
is
thinking
of
selling
her
well
sell
it
to
me
said
minoret
to
you
said
zelie
you
talk
as
if
you
were
master
of
everything
what
do
you
want
with
two
houses
in
nemours
if
i
don
t
settle
this
matter
of
the
farm
with
you
said
bongrand
our
lease
will
get
known
massin
will
put
in
a
fresh
claim
and
i
shall
lose
this
chance
of
liquidation
which
i
am
anxious
to
make
so
if
you
don
t
take
my
offer
i
shall
go
at
once
to
melun
where
some
farmers
i
know
are
ready
to
buy
the
farm
with
their
eyes
why
did
you
come
to
us
then
said
zelie
because
you
can
pay
me
in
cash
and
my
other
clients
would
make
me
wait
some
time
for
the
money
i
don
t
want
get
out
of
nemours
and
i
ll
pay
it
exclaimed
minoret
you
understand
that
i
can
not
answer
for
madame
de
portenduere
s
actions
said
bongrand
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
heard
her
say
but
i
feel
certain
they
will
not
remain
in
on
this
assurance
enforced
by
a
nudge
from
zelie
minoret
agreed
to
the
purchase
and
furnished
the
funds
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
due
to
the
doctor
s
estate
the
deed
of
sale
was
immediately
drawn
up
by
dionis
towards
the
end
of
june
bongrand
brought
the
balance
of
the
purchase
money
to
madame
de
portenduere
advising
her
to
invest
it
in
the
funds
where
joined
to
savinien
s
ten
thousand
it
would
give
her
at
five
per
cent
an
income
of
six
thousand
francs
thus
so
far
from
losing
her
resources
the
old
lady
actually
gained
by
the
transaction
but
she
did
not
leave
nemours
minoret
thought
he
had
been
tricked
as
though
bongrand
had
had
an
idea
that
ursula
s
presence
was
intolerable
to
him
and
he
felt
a
keen
resentment
which
embittered
his
hatred
to
his
victim
then
began
a
secret
drama
which
was
terrible
in
its
effects
the
struggle
of
two
determinations
one
which
impelled
minoret
to
drive
his
victim
from
nemours
the
other
which
gave
ursula
the
strength
to
bear
persecution
the
cause
of
which
was
for
a
certain
length
of
time
undiscoverable
the
situation
was
a
strange
and
even
unnatural
one
and
yet
it
was
led
up
to
by
all
the
preceding
events
which
served
as
a
preface
to
what
was
now
to
occur
madame
minoret
to
whom
her
husband
had
given
a
handsome
silver
service
costing
twenty
thousand
francs
gave
a
magnificent
dinner
every
sunday
the
day
on
which
her
son
the
deputy
procureur
came
from
fontainebleau
bringing
with
him
certain
of
his
friends
on
these
occasions
zelie
sent
to
paris
for
delicacies
obliging
dionis
the
notary
to
emulate
her
display
goupil
whom
the
minorets
endeavored
to
ignore
as
a
questionable
person
who
might
tarnish
their
splendor
was
not
invited
until
the
end
of
july
the
clerk
who
was
fully
aware
of
this
intended
neglect
was
forced
to
be
respectful
to
desire
who
since
his
entrance
into
office
had
assumed
a
haughty
and
dignified
air
even
in
his
own
family
you
must
have
forgotten
esther
goupil
said
to
him
as
you
are
so
much
in
love
with
mademoiselle
in
the
first
place
esther
is
dead
monsieur
and
in
the
next
i
have
never
even
thought
of
ursula
said
the
new
magistrate
why
what
did
you
tell
me
papa
minoret
cried
goupil
insolently
minoret
caught
in
a
lie
by
a
man
whom
he
feared
would
have
lost
countenance
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
project
in
his
head
which
was
in
fact
the
reason
why
goupil
was
invited
to
dinner
minoret
having
remembered
the
proposition
the
clerk
had
once
made
to
prevent
the
marriage
between
savinien
and
ursula
for
all
answer
he
led
goupil
hurriedly
to
the
end
of
the
garden
you
ll
soon
be
years
old
my
good
fellow
said
he
and
i
don
t
see
that
you
are
on
the
road
to
fortune
i
wish
you
well
for
after
all
you
were
once
my
son
s
companion
listen
to
me
if
you
can
persuade
that
little
mirouet
who
possesses
in
her
own
right
forty
thousand
francs
to
marry
you
i
will
give
you
as
true
as
my
name
is
minoret
the
means
to
buy
a
notary
s
practice
at
no
said
goupil
that
s
too
far
out
of
the
way
but
montargis
no
said
minoret
very
good
sens
replied
the
hideous
clerk
there
s
an
archbishop
at
sens
and
i
don
t
object
to
devotion
a
little
hypocrisy
and
there
you
are
on
the
way
to
fortune
besides
the
girl
is
pious
and
she
ll
succeed
at
it
is
to
be
fully
understood
continued
minoret
that
i
shall
not
pay
the
money
till
you
marry
my
cousin
for
whom
i
wish
to
provide
out
of
consideration
for
my
deceased
why
not
for
me
too
said
goupil
maliciously
instantly
suspecting
a
secret
motive
in
minoret
s
conduct
isn
t
it
through
information
you
got
from
me
that
you
make
thousand
a
year
from
that
land
without
a
single
enclosure
around
the
chateau
du
rouvre
the
fields
and
the
mill
the
other
side
of
the
loing
make
sixteen
thousand
more
come
old
fellow
do
you
mean
to
play
fair
with
me
if
i
wanted
to
show
my
teeth
i
could
coax
massin
to
buy
the
rouvre
estate
park
gardens
preserves
and
timber
you
d
better
think
twice
before
you
do
that
said
zelie
suddenly
intervening
if
i
choose
said
goupil
giving
her
a
viperish
look
massin
would
buy
the
whole
for
two
hundred
thousand
leave
us
wife
said
the
colossus
taking
zelie
by
the
arm
and
shoving
her
away
i
understand
him
we
have
been
so
very
busy
he
continued
returning
to
goupil
that
we
have
had
no
time
to
think
of
you
but
i
rely
on
your
friendship
to
buy
the
rouvre
estate
for
it
is
a
very
ancient
marquisate
said
goupil
maliciously
which
will
soon
be
worth
in
your
hands
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
that
means
a
capital
of
more
than
two
millions
as
money
is
my
son
could
then
marry
the
daughter
of
a
marshal
of
france
or
the
daughter
of
some
old
family
whose
influence
would
get
him
a
fine
place
under
the
government
in
paris
said
minoret
opening
his
huge
and
offering
a
pinch
to
goupil
very
good
but
will
you
play
fair
cried
goupil
shaking
his
fingers
minoret
pressed
the
clerk
s
hands
replying
on
my
word
of
chapter
xvii
the
malignity
of
provincial
minds
like
all
crafty
persons
goupil
fortunately
for
minoret
believed
that
the
proposed
marriage
with
ursula
was
only
a
pretext
on
the
part
of
the
colossus
and
zelie
for
making
up
with
him
now
that
he
was
opposing
them
with
massin
it
isn
t
he
thought
goupil
who
has
invented
this
scheme
i
know
my
zelie
she
taught
him
his
part
bah
i
ll
let
massin
go
in
three
years
time
i
ll
be
deputy
from
just
then
he
saw
bongrand
on
his
way
to
the
opposite
house
for
his
whist
and
he
rushed
hastily
after
him
you
take
a
great
interest
in
mademoiselle
mirouet
my
dear
monsieur
bongrand
he
said
i
know
you
will
not
be
indifferent
to
her
future
her
relations
are
considering
it
and
there
is
the
programme
she
ought
to
marry
a
notary
whose
practice
should
be
in
the
chief
town
of
an
arrondisement
this
notary
who
would
of
course
be
elected
deputy
in
three
years
should
settle
on
a
dower
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
on
she
can
do
better
than
that
said
bongrand
coldly
madame
de
portenduere
is
greatly
changed
since
her
misfortunes
trouble
is
killing
her
savinien
will
have
six
thousand
francs
a
year
and
ursula
has
a
capital
of
forty
thousand
i
shall
show
them
how
to
increase
it
a
la
massin
but
honestly
and
in
ten
years
they
will
have
a
little
fortune
savinien
will
do
a
foolish
thing
said
goupil
he
can
marry
mademoiselle
du
rouvre
whenever
he
likes
an
only
daughter
to
whom
the
uncle
and
aunt
intend
to
leave
a
fine
where
love
enters
farewell
prudence
as
la
fontaine
says
by
the
bye
who
is
your
notary
added
bongrand
from
curiosity
suppose
it
were
i
answered
goupil
you
exclaimed
bongrand
without
hiding
his
disgust
well
well
adieu
monsieur
replied
goupil
with
a
parting
glance
of
gall
and
hatred
and
defiance
do
you
wish
to
be
the
wife
of
a
notary
who
will
settle
a
hundred
thousand
francs
on
you
cried
bongrand
entering
madame
de
portenduere
s
little
salon
where
ursula
was
seated
beside
the
old
lady
ursula
and
savinien
trembled
and
looked
at
each
other
she
smiling
he
not
daring
to
show
his
uneasiness
i
am
not
mistress
of
myself
said
ursula
holding
out
her
hand
to
savinien
in
such
a
way
that
the
old
lady
did
not
perceive
the
gesture
well
i
have
refused
the
offer
without
consulting
why
did
you
do
that
said
madame
de
portenduere
i
think
the
position
of
a
notary
is
a
very
good
i
prefer
my
peaceful
poverty
said
ursula
which
is
really
wealth
compared
with
what
my
station
in
life
might
have
given
me
besides
my
old
nurse
spares
me
a
great
deal
of
care
and
i
shall
not
exchange
the
present
which
i
like
for
an
unknown
a
few
weeks
later
the
post
poured
into
two
hearts
the
poison
of
anonymous
letters
one
addressed
to
madame
de
portenduere
the
other
to
ursula
the
following
is
the
one
to
the
old
lady
you
love
your
son
you
wish
to
marry
him
in
a
manner
conformable
with
the
name
he
bears
and
yet
you
encourage
his
fancy
for
an
ambitious
girl
without
money
and
the
daughter
of
a
regimental
by
inviting
her
to
your
house
you
ought
to
marry
him
to
mademoiselle
du
rouvre
on
whom
her
two
uncles
the
marquis
de
ronquerolles
and
the
chevalier
du
rouvre
who
are
worth
money
would
settle
a
handsome
sum
rather
than
leave
it
to
that
old
fool
the
marquis
du
rouvre
who
runs
through
everything
madame
de
serizy
aunt
of
clementine
du
rouvre
who
has
just
lost
her
only
son
in
the
campaign
in
algiers
will
no
doubt
adopt
her
niece
a
person
who
is
your
assures
you
that
savinien
will
be
the
letter
to
ursula
was
as
follows
dear
ursula
there
is
a
young
man
in
nemours
who
idolizes
you
he
can
not
see
you
working
at
your
window
without
emotions
which
prove
to
him
that
his
love
will
last
through
life
this
young
man
is
gifted
with
an
iron
will
and
a
spirit
of
perseverance
which
nothing
can
discourage
receive
his
addresses
favorably
for
his
intentions
are
pure
and
he
humbly
asks
your
hand
with
a
sincere
desire
to
make
you
happy
his
fortune
already
suitable
is
nothing
to
that
which
he
will
make
for
you
when
you
are
once
his
wife
you
shall
be
received
at
court
as
the
wife
of
a
minister
and
one
of
the
first
ladies
in
the
land
as
he
sees
you
every
day
without
your
being
able
to
see
him
put
a
pot
of
la
bougival
s
pinks
in
your
window
and
he
will
understand
from
that
that
he
has
your
permission
to
present
himself
ursula
burned
the
letter
and
said
nothing
about
it
to
savinien
two
days
later
she
received
another
letter
in
the
following
language
you
do
wrong
my
dear
ursula
not
to
answer
one
who
loves
you
better
than
life
itself
you
think
you
will
marry
savinien
you
are
very
much
mistaken
that
marriage
will
not
take
place
madame
de
portenduere
went
this
morning
to
rouvre
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
clementine
for
her
son
savinien
will
yield
in
the
end
what
objection
can
he
make
the
uncles
of
the
young
lady
are
willing
to
guarantee
their
fortune
to
her
it
amounts
to
over
sixty
thousand
francs
a
this
letter
agonized
ursula
s
heart
and
afflicted
her
with
the
tortures
of
jealousy
a
form
of
suffering
hitherto
unknown
to
her
but
which
to
this
fine
organization
so
sensitive
to
pain
threw
a
pall
over
the
present
and
over
the
future
and
even
over
the
past
from
the
moment
when
she
received
this
fatal
paper
she
lay
on
the
doctor
s
sofa
her
eyes
fixed
on
space
lost
in
a
dreadful
dream
in
an
instant
the
chill
of
death
had
come
upon
her
warm
young
life
alas
worse
than
that
it
was
like
the
awful
awakening
of
the
dead
to
the
sense
that
there
was
no
god
the
masterpiece
of
that
strange
genius
called
jean
paul
four
times
la
bougival
called
her
to
breakfast
when
the
faithful
creature
tried
to
remonstrate
ursula
waved
her
hand
and
answered
in
one
harsh
word
hush
said
despotically
in
strange
contrast
to
her
usual
gentle
manner
la
bougival
watching
her
mistress
through
the
glass
door
saw
her
alternately
red
with
a
consuming
fever
and
blue
as
if
a
shudder
of
cold
had
succeeded
that
unnatural
heat
this
condition
grew
worse
and
worse
up
to
four
o
clock
then
she
rose
to
see
if
savinien
were
coming
but
he
did
not
come
jealousy
and
distrust
tear
all
reserves
from
love
ursula
who
till
then
had
never
made
one
gesture
by
which
her
love
could
be
guessed
now
took
her
hat
and
shawl
and
rushed
into
the
passage
as
if
to
go
and
meet
him
but
an
afterthought
of
modesty
sent
her
back
to
her
little
salon
where
she
stayed
and
wept
when
the
abbe
arrived
in
the
evening
la
bougival
met
him
at
the
door
ah
monsieur
she
cried
i
don
t
know
what
s
the
matter
with
mademoiselle
she
is
i
know
said
the
abbe
sadly
stopping
the
words
of
the
poor
nurse
he
then
told
ursula
what
she
had
not
dared
to
verify
that
madame
de
portenduere
had
gone
to
dine
at
rouvre
and
savinien
too
she
asked
ursula
was
seized
with
a
little
nervous
tremor
which
made
the
abbe
quiver
as
though
a
whole
leyden
jar
had
been
discharged
at
him
he
felt
moreover
a
lasting
commotion
in
his
heart
so
we
shall
not
go
there
he
said
as
gently
as
he
could
and
my
child
it
would
be
better
if
you
did
not
go
there
again
the
old
lady
will
receive
you
in
a
way
to
wound
your
pride
monsieur
bongrand
and
i
who
had
succeeded
in
bringing
her
to
consider
your
marriage
have
no
idea
from
what
quarter
this
new
influence
has
come
to
change
her
as
it
were
in
a
i
expect
the
worst
nothing
can
surprise
me
now
said
ursula
in
a
pained
voice
in
such
extremities
it
is
a
comfort
to
feel
that
we
have
done
nothing
to
displease
submit
dear
daughter
and
do
not
seek
to
fathom
the
ways
of
providence
said
the
abbe
i
shall
not
unjustly
distrust
the
character
of
monsieur
de
portenduere
why
do
you
no
longer
call
him
savinien
asked
the
priest
who
detected
a
slight
bitterness
in
ursula
s
tone
of
my
dear
savinien
cried
the
girl
bursting
into
tears
yes
my
good
friend
she
said
sobbing
a
voice
tells
me
he
is
as
noble
in
heart
as
he
is
in
race
he
has
not
only
told
me
that
he
loves
me
alone
but
he
has
proved
it
in
a
hundred
delicate
ways
and
by
restraining
heroically
his
ardent
feelings
lately
when
he
took
the
hand
i
held
out
to
him
that
evening
when
monsieur
bongrand
proposed
to
me
a
husband
it
was
the
first
time
i
swear
to
you
that
i
had
ever
given
it
he
began
with
a
jest
when
he
blew
me
a
kiss
across
the
street
but
since
then
our
affection
has
never
outwardly
passed
as
you
well
know
the
narrowest
limits
but
i
will
tell
you
you
who
read
my
soul
except
in
this
one
region
where
none
but
the
angels
see
well
i
will
tell
you
this
love
has
been
in
me
the
secret
spring
of
many
seeming
merits
it
made
me
accept
my
poverty
it
softened
the
bitterness
of
my
irreparable
loss
for
my
mourning
is
more
perhaps
in
my
clothes
now
than
in
my
heart
oh
was
i
wrong
can
it
be
that
love
was
stronger
in
me
than
my
gratitude
to
my
benefactor
and
god
has
punished
me
for
it
but
how
could
it
be
otherwise
i
respected
in
myself
savinien
s
future
wife
yes
perhaps
i
was
too
proud
perhaps
it
is
that
pride
which
god
has
humbled
god
alone
as
you
have
often
told
me
should
be
the
end
and
object
of
all
our
the
abbe
was
deeply
touched
as
he
watched
the
tears
roll
down
her
pallid
face
the
higher
her
sense
of
security
had
been
the
lower
she
was
now
to
fall
but
she
said
continuing
if
i
return
to
my
orphaned
condition
i
shall
know
how
to
take
up
its
feelings
after
all
could
i
have
tied
a
round
the
neck
of
him
i
love
what
can
he
do
here
who
am
i
to
bind
him
to
me
besides
do
i
not
love
him
with
a
friendship
so
divine
that
i
can
bear
the
loss
of
my
own
happiness
and
my
hopes
you
know
i
have
often
blamed
myself
for
letting
my
hopes
rest
upon
a
grave
and
for
knowing
they
were
waiting
on
that
poor
old
lady
s
death
if
savinien
is
rich
and
happy
with
another
i
have
enough
to
pay
for
my
entrance
to
a
convent
where
i
shall
go
at
once
there
can
no
more
be
two
loves
in
a
woman
s
heart
than
there
can
be
two
masters
in
heaven
and
the
life
of
a
religious
is
attractive
to
he
could
not
let
his
mother
go
alone
to
rouvre
said
the
abbe
gently
do
not
let
us
talk
of
that
my
dear
good
friend
she
answered
i
will
write
and
set
him
free
i
am
glad
to
have
to
close
the
windows
of
this
room
she
continued
telling
her
old
friend
of
the
anonymous
letters
but
declaring
that
she
would
not
allow
any
inquiries
to
be
made
as
to
who
her
unknown
lover
might
be
why
it
was
an
anonymous
letter
that
first
took
madame
de
portenduere
to
rouvre
cried
the
abbe
you
are
annoyed
for
some
object
by
evil
how
can
that
be
neither
savinien
nor
i
have
injured
any
one
and
i
am
no
longer
an
obstacle
to
the
prosperity
of
well
well
my
child
said
the
abbe
quietly
let
us
profit
by
this
tempest
which
has
scattered
our
little
circle
to
put
the
library
in
order
the
books
are
still
in
heaps
bongrand
and
i
want
to
get
them
in
order
we
wish
to
make
a
search
among
them
put
your
trust
in
god
and
remember
also
that
in
our
good
bongrand
and
in
me
you
have
two
devoted
that
is
much
very
much
she
said
going
with
him
to
the
threshold
of
the
door
where
she
stretched
out
her
neck
like
a
bird
looking
over
its
nest
hoping
against
hope
to
see
savinien
just
then
minoret
and
goupil
returning
from
a
walk
in
the
meadows
stopped
as
they
passed
and
the
colossus
spoke
to
ursula
is
anything
the
matter
cousin
for
we
are
still
cousins
are
we
not
you
seem
goupil
looked
so
ardently
at
ursula
that
she
was
frightened
and
went
back
into
the
house
without
replying
she
is
cross
said
minoret
to
the
abbe
mademoiselle
mirouet
is
quite
right
not
to
talk
to
men
on
the
threshold
of
her
door
said
the
abbe
she
is
too
young
oh
said
goupil
i
am
told
she
doesn
t
lack
the
abbe
bowed
hurriedly
and
went
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
rue
des
bourgeois
well
said
goupil
to
minoret
the
thing
is
working
did
you
notice
how
pale
she
was
within
a
fortnight
she
ll
have
left
the
town
you
ll
better
have
you
for
a
friend
than
an
enemy
cried
minoret
frightened
at
the
atrocious
grin
which
gave
to
goupil
s
face
the
diabolical
expression
of
the
mephistopheles
of
joseph
brideau
i
should
think
so
returned
goupil
if
she
doesn
t
marry
me
i
ll
make
her
die
of
do
it
my
boy
and
i
ll
give
you
the
money
to
buy
a
practice
in
paris
you
can
then
marry
a
rich
woman
poor
ursula
what
makes
you
so
bitter
against
her
what
has
she
done
to
you
asked
the
clerk
in
surprise
she
annoys
me
said
minoret
gruffly
well
wait
till
monday
and
you
shall
see
how
i
ll
rasp
her
said
goupil
studying
the
expression
of
the
late
post
master
s
face
the
next
day
la
bougival
carried
the
following
letter
to
savinien
i
don
t
know
what
the
dear
child
has
written
to
you
she
said
but
she
is
almost
dead
this
who
reading
this
letter
to
her
lover
could
fail
to
understand
the
sufferings
the
poor
girl
had
gone
through
during
the
night
my
dear
savinien
your
mother
wishes
you
to
marry
mademoiselle
du
rouvre
and
perhaps
she
is
right
you
are
placed
between
a
life
that
is
almost
and
a
life
of
opulence
between
the
betrothed
of
your
heart
and
a
wife
in
conformity
with
the
demands
of
the
world
between
obedience
to
your
mother
and
the
fulfilment
of
your
own
choice
for
i
still
believe
that
you
have
chosen
me
savinien
if
you
have
now
to
make
your
decision
i
wish
you
to
do
so
in
absolute
freedom
i
give
you
back
the
promise
you
made
to
yourself
not
to
me
in
a
moment
which
can
never
fade
from
my
memory
for
it
was
like
other
days
that
have
succeeded
it
of
angelic
purity
and
sweetness
that
memory
will
suffice
me
for
my
life
if
you
should
persist
in
your
pledge
to
me
a
dark
and
terrible
idea
would
henceforth
trouble
my
happiness
in
the
midst
of
our
privations
which
we
have
hitherto
accepted
so
gayly
you
might
reflect
too
late
that
life
would
have
been
to
you
a
better
thing
had
you
now
conformed
to
the
laws
of
the
world
if
you
were
a
man
to
express
that
thought
it
would
be
to
me
the
sentence
of
an
agonizing
death
if
you
did
not
express
it
i
should
watch
suspiciously
every
cloud
upon
your
brow
dear
savinien
i
have
preferred
you
to
all
else
on
earth
i
was
right
to
do
so
for
my
godfather
though
jealous
of
you
used
to
say
to
me
love
him
my
child
you
will
certainly
belong
to
each
other
one
of
these
when
i
went
to
paris
i
loved
you
hopelessly
and
the
feeling
contented
me
i
do
not
know
if
i
can
now
return
to
it
but
i
shall
try
what
are
we
after
all
at
this
moment
brother
and
sister
let
us
stay
so
marry
that
happy
girl
who
can
have
the
joy
of
giving
to
your
name
the
lustre
it
ought
to
have
and
which
your
mother
thinks
i
should
diminish
you
will
not
hear
of
me
again
the
world
will
approve
of
you
i
shall
never
blame
you
but
i
shall
love
you
ever
adieu
then
wait
cried
the
young
man
signing
to
la
bougival
to
sit
down
he
scratched
off
hastily
the
following
reply
my
dear
ursula
your
letter
cuts
me
to
the
heart
inasmuch
as
you
have
needlessly
felt
such
pain
and
also
because
our
hearts
for
the
first
time
have
failed
to
understand
each
other
if
you
are
not
my
wife
now
it
is
solely
because
i
can
not
marry
without
my
mother
s
consent
dear
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
and
a
pretty
cottage
on
the
loing
why
that
s
a
fortune
is
it
not
you
know
we
calculated
that
if
we
kept
la
bougival
we
could
lay
by
half
our
income
every
year
you
allowed
me
that
evening
in
your
uncle
s
garden
to
consider
you
mine
you
can
not
now
of
yourself
break
those
ties
which
are
common
to
both
of
ursula
need
i
tell
you
that
i
yesterday
informed
monsieur
du
rouvre
that
even
if
i
were
free
i
could
not
receive
a
fortune
from
a
young
person
whom
i
did
not
know
my
mother
refuses
to
see
you
again
i
must
therefore
lose
the
happiness
of
our
evenings
but
surely
you
will
not
deprive
me
of
the
brief
moments
i
can
spend
at
your
window
this
evening
then
nothing
can
separate
us
take
this
to
her
my
old
woman
she
must
not
be
unhappy
one
moment
that
afternoon
at
four
o
clock
returning
from
the
walk
which
he
always
took
expressly
to
pass
before
ursula
s
house
savinien
found
his
mistress
waiting
for
him
her
face
a
little
pallid
from
these
sudden
changes
and
excitements
it
seems
to
me
that
until
now
i
have
never
known
what
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
is
she
said
to
him
you
once
said
to
me
replied
savinien
smiling
for
i
remember
all
your
words
love
lives
by
patience
we
will
wait
dear
you
have
separated
love
from
faith
ah
this
shall
be
the
end
of
our
quarrels
we
will
never
have
another
you
have
claimed
to
love
me
better
than
i
love
you
but
did
i
ever
doubt
you
he
said
offering
her
a
bouquet
of
arranged
to
express
his
thoughts
you
have
never
had
any
reason
to
doubt
me
she
replied
and
besides
you
don
t
know
all
she
added
in
a
troubled
voice
ursula
had
refused
to
receive
letters
by
the
post
but
that
afternoon
without
being
able
even
to
guess
at
the
nature
of
the
trick
she
had
found
a
few
moments
before
savinien
s
arrival
a
letter
tossed
on
her
sofa
which
contained
the
words
tremble
a
rejected
lover
can
become
a
withstanding
savinien
s
entreaties
she
refused
to
tell
him
out
of
prudence
the
secret
of
her
fears
the
delight
of
seeing
him
again
after
she
had
thought
him
lost
to
her
could
alone
have
made
her
recover
from
the
mortal
chill
of
terror
the
expectation
of
indefinite
evil
is
torture
to
every
one
suffering
assumes
the
proportions
of
the
unknown
and
the
unknown
is
the
infinite
of
the
soul
to
ursula
the
pain
was
exquisite
something
without
her
bounded
at
the
slightest
noise
yet
she
was
afraid
of
silence
and
suspected
even
the
walls
of
collusion
even
her
sleep
was
restless
goupil
who
knew
nothing
of
her
nature
delicate
as
that
of
a
flower
had
found
with
the
instinct
of
evil
the
poison
that
could
wither
and
destroy
her
the
next
day
passed
without
a
shock
ursula
sat
playing
on
her
piano
till
very
late
and
went
to
bed
easier
in
mind
and
very
sleepy
about
midnight
she
was
awakened
by
the
music
of
a
band
composed
of
a
clarinet
hautboy
flute
cornet
a
piston
trombone
bassoon
flageolet
and
triangle
all
the
neighbours
were
at
their
windows
the
poor
girl
already
frightened
at
seeing
the
people
in
the
street
received
a
dreadful
shock
as
she
heard
the
coarse
rough
voice
of
a
man
proclaiming
in
loud
tones
for
the
beautiful
ursula
mirouet
from
her
the
next
day
sunday
the
whole
town
had
heard
of
it
and
as
ursula
entered
and
left
the
church
she
saw
the
groups
of
people
who
stood
gossiping
about
her
and
felt
herself
the
object
of
their
terrible
curiosity
the
serenade
set
all
tongues
wagging
and
conjectures
were
rife
on
all
sides
ursula
reached
home
more
dead
than
alive
determined
not
to
leave
the
house
again
the
abbe
having
advised
her
to
say
vespers
in
her
own
room
as
she
entered
the
house
she
saw
lying
in
the
passage
which
was
floored
with
brick
a
letter
which
had
evidently
been
slipped
under
the
door
she
picked
it
up
and
read
it
under
the
idea
that
it
would
obtain
an
explanation
it
was
as
follows
resign
yourself
to
becoming
my
wife
rich
and
idolized
i
am
resolved
if
you
are
not
mine
living
you
shall
be
mine
dead
to
your
refusal
you
may
attribute
not
only
your
own
misfortunes
but
those
which
will
fall
on
others
he
who
loves
you
and
whose
wife
you
will
curiously
enough
at
the
very
moment
that
the
gentle
victim
of
this
plot
was
drooping
like
a
cut
flower
mesdemoiselles
massin
dionis
and
cremiere
were
envying
her
lot
she
is
a
lucky
girl
they
were
saying
people
talk
of
her
and
court
her
and
quarrel
about
her
the
serenade
was
charming
there
was
a
what
s
a
piston
a
new
musical
instrument
as
big
as
this
see
replied
angelique
cremiere
to
pamela
massin
early
that
morning
savinien
had
gone
to
fontainebleau
to
endeavor
to
find
out
who
had
engaged
the
musicians
of
the
regiment
then
in
garrison
but
as
there
were
two
men
to
each
instrument
it
was
impossible
to
find
out
which
of
them
had
gone
to
nemours
the
colonel
forbade
them
to
play
for
any
private
person
in
future
without
his
permission
savinien
had
an
interview
with
the
procureur
du
roi
ursula
s
legal
guardian
and
explained
to
him
the
injury
these
scenes
would
do
to
a
young
girl
naturally
so
delicate
and
sensitive
begging
him
to
take
some
action
to
discover
the
author
of
such
wrong
three
nights
later
three
violins
a
flute
a
guitar
and
a
hautboy
began
another
serenade
this
time
the
musicians
fled
towards
montargis
where
there
happened
then
to
be
a
company
of
comic
actors
a
loud
and
ringing
voice
called
out
as
they
left
to
the
daughter
of
the
regimental
bandsman
by
this
means
all
nemours
came
to
know
the
profession
of
ursula
s
father
a
secret
the
old
doctor
had
sedulously
kept
savinien
did
not
go
to
montargis
he
received
in
the
course
of
the
day
an
anonymous
letter
containing
a
prophecy
you
will
never
marry
ursula
if
you
wish
her
to
live
give
her
up
at
once
to
a
man
who
loves
her
more
than
you
love
her
he
has
made
himself
a
musician
and
an
artist
to
please
her
and
he
would
rather
see
her
dead
than
let
her
be
your
the
doctor
came
to
ursula
three
times
in
the
course
of
that
day
for
she
was
really
in
danger
of
death
from
the
horror
of
this
mysterious
persecution
feeling
that
some
infernal
hand
had
plunged
her
into
the
mire
the
poor
girl
lay
like
a
martyr
she
said
nothing
but
lifted
her
eyes
to
heaven
and
wept
no
more
she
seemed
awaiting
other
blows
and
prayed
fervently
i
am
glad
i
can
not
go
down
into
the
salon
she
said
to
monsieur
bongrand
and
the
abbe
who
left
her
as
little
as
possible
would
come
and
i
am
now
unworthy
of
the
looks
with
which
blessed
me
do
you
think
will
suspect
me
if
savinien
does
not
discover
the
author
of
these
infamies
he
means
to
get
the
assistance
of
the
paris
police
said
bongrand
whoever
it
is
will
know
i
am
dying
said
ursula
and
will
cease
to
trouble
the
abbe
bongrand
and
savinien
were
lost
in
conjectures
and
suspicions
together
with
tiennette
la
bougival
and
two
persons
on
whom
the
abbe
could
rely
they
kept
the
closest
watch
and
were
on
their
guard
night
and
day
for
a
week
but
no
indiscretion
could
betray
goupil
whose
machinations
were
known
to
himself
only
there
were
no
more
serenades
and
no
more
letters
and
little
by
little
the
watch
relaxed
bongrand
thought
the
author
of
the
wrong
was
frightened
savinien
believed
that
the
procureur
du
roi
to
whom
he
had
sent
the
letters
received
by
ursula
and
himself
and
his
mother
had
taken
steps
to
put
an
end
to
the
persecution
the
armistice
was
not
of
long
duration
however
when
the
doctor
had
checked
the
nervous
fever
from
which
poor
ursula
was
suffering
and
just
as
she
was
recovering
her
courage
a
was
found
early
one
morning
in
july
attached
to
her
window
the
postilion
of
the
declared
that
as
he
drove
past
the
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
small
man
was
in
the
act
of
coming
down
the
ladder
and
though
he
tried
to
pull
up
his
horses
being
startled
carried
him
down
the
hill
so
fast
that
he
was
out
of
nemours
before
he
stopped
them
some
of
the
persons
who
frequented
dionis
s
salon
attributed
these
manoeuvres
to
the
marquis
du
rouvre
then
much
hampered
in
means
for
massin
held
his
notes
to
a
large
amount
it
was
said
that
a
prompt
marriage
of
his
daughter
to
savinien
would
save
chateau
du
rouvre
from
his
creditors
and
madame
de
portenduere
the
gossips
added
would
approve
of
anything
that
would
discredit
and
degrade
ursula
and
lead
to
this
marriage
of
her
son
so
far
from
this
being
true
the
old
lady
was
vanquished
by
the
sufferings
of
the
innocent
girl
the
abbe
was
so
painfully
overcome
by
this
act
of
infernal
wickedness
that
he
fell
ill
himself
and
was
kept
to
the
house
for
several
days
poor
ursula
to
whom
this
last
insult
had
caused
a
relapse
received
by
post
a
letter
from
the
abbe
which
was
taken
in
by
la
bougival
on
recognizing
the
handwriting
it
was
as
follows
my
child
leave
nemours
and
thus
evade
the
malice
of
your
enemies
perhaps
they
are
seeking
to
endanger
savinien
s
life
i
will
tell
you
more
when
i
am
able
to
go
to
you
your
devoted
friend
chaperon
when
savinien
who
was
almost
maddened
by
these
proceedings
carried
this
letter
to
the
abbe
the
poor
priest
read
it
and
it
so
amazed
and
was
he
to
see
the
perfection
with
which
his
own
handwriting
and
signature
were
imitated
the
dangerous
condition
into
which
this
last
atrocity
threw
poor
ursula
sent
savinien
once
more
to
the
procureur
du
roi
with
the
forged
letter
a
murder
is
being
committed
by
means
that
the
law
can
not
touch
he
said
upon
an
orphan
whom
the
code
places
in
your
care
as
legal
guardian
what
is
to
be
done
if
you
can
find
any
means
of
repression
said
the
official
i
will
adopt
them
but
i
know
of
none
that
infamous
wretch
gives
the
best
advice
mademoiselle
mirouet
must
be
sent
to
the
sisters
of
the
adoration
of
the
sacred
heart
meanwhile
the
commissary
of
police
at
fontainebleau
shall
at
my
request
authorize
you
to
carry
arms
in
your
own
defence
i
have
been
myself
to
rouvre
and
i
found
monsieur
du
rouvre
justly
indignant
at
the
suspicions
some
of
the
nemours
people
have
put
upon
him
minoret
the
father
of
my
assistant
is
in
treaty
for
the
purchase
of
the
estate
mademoiselle
is
to
marry
a
rich
polish
count
and
monsieur
du
rouvre
himself
left
the
neighbourhood
the
day
i
saw
him
to
avoid
arrest
for
desire
minoret
when
questioned
by
his
chief
dared
not
tell
his
thought
he
recognized
goupil
goupil
he
fully
believed
was
the
only
man
capable
of
carrying
a
persecution
to
the
very
verge
of
the
penal
code
without
infringing
a
hair
upon
it
chapter
xviii
a
vengeance
impunity
secrecy
and
success
increased
goupil
s
audacity
he
made
massin
who
was
completely
his
dupe
sue
the
marquis
du
rouvre
for
his
notes
so
as
to
force
him
to
sell
the
remainder
of
his
property
to
minoret
thus
prepared
he
opened
negotiations
for
a
practice
at
sens
and
then
resolved
to
strike
a
last
blow
to
obtain
ursula
he
meant
to
imitate
certain
young
men
in
paris
who
owed
their
wives
and
their
fortunes
to
abduction
he
knew
that
the
services
he
had
rendered
to
minoret
to
massin
and
to
cremiere
and
the
protection
of
dionis
and
the
mayor
of
nemours
would
enable
him
to
hush
up
the
affair
he
resolved
to
throw
off
the
mask
believing
ursula
too
feeble
in
the
condition
to
which
he
had
reduced
her
to
make
any
resistance
but
before
risking
this
last
throw
in
the
game
he
thought
it
best
to
have
an
explanation
with
minoret
and
he
chose
his
opportunity
at
rouvre
where
he
went
with
his
patron
for
the
first
time
after
the
deeds
were
signed
minoret
had
that
morning
received
a
confidential
letter
from
his
son
asking
him
for
information
as
to
what
was
happening
in
connection
with
ursula
information
that
he
desired
to
obtain
before
going
to
nemours
with
the
procureur
du
roi
to
place
her
under
shelter
from
these
atrocities
in
the
convent
of
the
adoration
desire
exhorted
his
father
in
case
this
persecution
should
be
the
work
of
any
of
their
friends
to
give
to
whoever
it
might
be
warning
and
good
advice
for
even
if
the
law
could
not
punish
this
crime
it
would
certainly
discover
the
truth
and
hold
it
over
the
delinquent
s
head
minoret
had
now
attained
a
great
object
owner
of
the
chateau
du
rouvre
one
of
the
finest
estates
in
the
gatinais
he
had
also
a
of
some
forty
odd
thousand
francs
a
year
from
the
rich
domains
which
surrounded
the
park
he
could
well
afford
to
snap
his
fingers
at
goupil
besides
he
intended
to
live
on
the
estate
where
the
sight
of
ursula
would
no
longer
trouble
him
my
boy
he
said
to
goupil
as
they
walked
along
the
terrace
let
my
young
cousin
alone
pooh
said
the
clerk
unable
to
imagine
what
capricious
conduct
meant
oh
i
m
not
ungrateful
you
have
enabled
me
to
get
this
fine
brick
chateau
with
the
stone
copings
which
couldn
t
be
built
now
for
two
hundred
thousand
francs
and
those
farms
and
preserves
and
the
park
and
gardens
and
woods
all
for
two
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
francs
no
i
m
not
ungrateful
i
ll
give
you
ten
per
cent
twenty
thousand
francs
for
your
services
and
you
can
buy
a
sheriff
s
practice
in
nemours
i
ll
guarantee
you
a
marriage
with
one
of
cremiere
s
daughters
the
the
one
who
talks
piston
cried
goupil
she
ll
have
thirty
thousand
francs
replied
minoret
don
t
you
see
my
dear
boy
that
you
are
cut
out
for
a
sheriff
just
as
i
was
to
be
a
post
master
people
should
keep
to
their
very
well
then
said
goupil
falling
from
the
pinnacle
of
his
hopes
here
s
a
stamped
cheque
write
me
an
order
for
twenty
thousand
francs
i
want
the
money
in
hand
at
minoret
had
eighteen
thousand
francs
by
him
at
that
moment
of
which
his
wife
knew
nothing
he
thought
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
goupil
was
to
sign
the
draft
the
clerk
seeing
the
flush
of
seigniorial
fever
on
the
face
of
the
imbecile
and
colossal
machiavelli
threw
him
an
au
revoir
by
way
of
farewell
accompanied
with
a
glance
which
would
have
made
any
one
but
an
idiotic
parvenu
lost
in
contemplation
of
the
magnificent
chateau
built
in
the
style
in
vogue
under
louis
tremble
in
his
shoes
are
you
not
going
to
wait
for
me
he
cried
observing
that
goupil
was
going
away
on
foot
you
ll
find
me
on
our
path
never
fear
papa
minoret
replied
goupil
athirst
for
vengeance
and
resolved
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
zigzags
of
minoret
s
strange
conduct
since
the
day
when
the
last
vile
calumny
had
sullied
her
life
ursula
a
prey
to
one
of
those
inexplicable
maladies
the
seat
of
which
is
in
the
soul
seemed
to
be
rapidly
nearing
death
she
was
deathly
pale
speaking
only
at
rare
intervals
and
then
in
slow
and
feeble
words
everything
about
her
her
glance
of
gentle
indifference
even
the
expression
of
her
forehead
all
revealed
the
presence
of
some
consuming
thought
she
was
thinking
how
the
ideal
wreath
of
chastity
with
which
throughout
all
ages
the
peoples
crowned
their
virgins
had
fallen
from
her
brow
she
heard
in
the
void
and
in
the
silence
the
dishonoring
words
the
malicious
comments
the
laughter
of
the
little
town
the
trial
was
too
heavy
her
innocence
was
too
delicate
to
allow
her
to
survive
the
murderous
blow
she
complained
no
more
a
sorrowful
smile
was
on
her
lips
her
eyes
appealed
to
heaven
to
the
sovereign
of
angels
against
man
s
injustice
when
goupil
reached
nemours
ursula
had
just
been
carried
down
from
her
chamber
to
the
in
the
arms
of
la
bougival
and
the
doctor
a
great
event
was
about
to
take
place
when
madame
de
portenduere
became
really
aware
that
the
girl
was
dying
like
an
ermine
though
less
injured
in
her
honor
than
clarissa
harlowe
she
resolved
to
go
to
her
and
comfort
her
the
sight
of
her
son
s
anguish
who
during
the
whole
preceding
night
had
seemed
beside
himself
made
the
breton
soul
of
the
old
woman
yield
moreover
it
seemed
worthy
of
her
own
dignity
to
revive
the
courage
of
a
girl
so
pure
and
she
saw
in
her
visit
a
counterpoise
to
all
the
evil
done
by
the
little
town
her
opinion
surely
more
powerful
than
that
of
the
crowd
ought
to
carry
with
it
she
thought
the
influence
of
race
this
step
which
the
abbe
came
to
announce
made
so
great
a
change
in
ursula
that
the
doctor
who
was
about
to
ask
for
a
consultation
of
parisian
doctors
recovered
hope
they
placed
her
on
her
uncle
s
sofa
and
such
was
the
character
of
her
beauty
that
she
lay
there
in
her
mourning
garments
pale
from
suffering
she
was
more
exquisitely
lovely
than
in
the
happiest
hours
of
her
life
when
savinien
with
his
mother
on
his
arm
entered
the
room
she
colored
vividly
do
not
rise
my
child
said
the
old
lady
imperatively
weak
and
ill
as
i
am
myself
i
wished
to
come
and
tell
you
my
feelings
about
what
is
happening
i
respect
you
as
the
purest
the
most
religious
and
excellent
girl
in
the
gatinais
and
i
think
you
worthy
to
make
the
happiness
of
a
at
first
poor
ursula
was
unable
to
answer
she
took
the
withered
hands
of
savinien
s
mother
and
kissed
them
ah
madame
she
said
in
a
faltering
voice
i
should
never
have
had
the
boldness
to
think
of
rising
above
my
condition
if
i
had
not
been
encouraged
by
promises
my
only
claim
was
that
of
an
affection
without
bounds
but
now
they
have
found
the
means
to
separate
me
from
him
i
love
they
have
made
me
unworthy
of
him
never
she
cried
with
a
ring
in
her
voice
which
painfully
affected
those
about
her
never
will
i
consent
to
give
to
any
man
a
degraded
hand
a
stained
reputation
i
loved
too
well
yes
i
can
admit
it
in
my
present
condition
i
love
a
creature
almost
as
i
love
god
and
god
hush
my
child
do
not
calumniate
god
come
my
daughter
said
the
old
lady
making
an
effort
do
not
exaggerate
the
harm
done
by
an
infamous
joke
in
which
no
one
believes
i
give
you
my
word
you
will
live
and
you
shall
be
we
shall
be
happy
cried
savinien
kneeling
beside
ursula
and
kissing
her
hand
my
mother
has
called
you
her
enough
enough
said
the
doctor
feeling
his
patient
s
pulse
do
not
kill
her
with
at
that
moment
goupil
who
found
the
street
door
ajar
opened
that
of
the
little
salon
and
showed
his
hideous
face
blazing
with
thoughts
of
vengeance
which
had
crowded
into
his
mind
as
he
hurried
along
monsieur
de
portenduere
he
said
in
a
voice
like
the
hissing
of
a
viper
forced
from
its
hole
what
do
you
want
said
savinien
rising
from
his
knees
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
savinien
left
the
room
and
goupil
took
him
into
the
little
courtyard
swear
to
me
by
ursula
s
life
by
your
honor
as
a
gentleman
to
do
by
me
as
if
i
had
never
told
you
what
i
am
about
to
tell
do
this
and
i
will
reveal
to
you
the
cause
of
the
persecutions
directed
against
mademoiselle
can
i
put
a
stop
to
them
can
i
avenge
them
on
their
author
yes
on
his
tool
why
not
because
i
am
the
savinien
turned
pale
i
have
just
seen
ursula
said
goupil
ursula
said
the
lover
looking
fixedly
at
the
clerk
mademoiselle
mirouet
continued
goupil
made
respectful
by
savinien
s
tone
and
i
would
undo
with
my
blood
the
wrong
that
has
been
done
i
repent
of
it
if
you
were
to
kill
me
in
a
duel
or
otherwise
what
good
would
my
blood
do
you
can
you
drink
it
at
this
moment
it
would
poison
the
cold
reasoning
of
the
man
together
with
a
feeling
of
eager
curiosity
calmed
savinien
s
anger
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
goupil
with
a
look
which
made
that
moral
deformity
writhe
who
set
you
at
this
work
said
the
young
man
will
you
swear
what
to
do
you
no
harm
i
wish
that
you
and
mademoiselle
mirouet
should
not
forgive
she
will
forgive
you
i
never
but
at
least
you
will
forget
what
terrible
power
the
reason
has
when
it
is
used
to
further
here
were
two
men
longing
to
tear
one
another
in
pieces
standing
in
that
courtyard
within
two
inches
of
each
other
compelled
to
talk
together
and
united
by
a
single
sentiment
i
will
forgive
you
but
i
shall
not
the
agreement
is
off
said
goupil
coldly
savinien
lost
patience
he
applied
a
blow
upon
the
man
s
face
which
echoed
through
the
courtyard
and
nearly
knocked
him
down
making
savinien
himself
stagger
it
is
only
what
i
deserve
said
goupil
for
committing
such
a
folly
i
thought
you
more
noble
than
you
are
you
have
abused
the
advantage
i
gave
you
you
are
in
my
power
now
he
added
with
a
look
of
hatred
you
are
a
murderer
said
savinien
no
more
than
a
dagger
is
a
i
beg
your
pardon
said
savinien
are
you
revenged
enough
said
goupil
with
ferocious
irony
will
you
stop
here
reciprocal
pardon
and
forgetfulness
replied
savinien
give
me
your
hand
said
the
clerk
holding
out
his
own
it
is
yours
said
savinien
swallowing
the
shame
for
ursula
s
sake
now
speak
who
made
you
do
this
thing
goupil
looked
into
the
scales
as
it
were
on
one
side
was
savinien
s
blow
on
the
other
his
hatred
against
minoret
for
a
second
he
was
undecided
then
a
voice
said
to
him
you
will
be
notary
and
he
answered
pardon
and
forgetfulness
yes
on
both
sides
monsieur
who
is
persecuting
ursula
persisted
savinien
minoret
he
would
have
liked
to
see
her
buried
why
i
can
t
tell
you
that
but
we
might
find
out
the
reason
don
t
mix
me
up
in
all
this
i
could
do
nothing
to
help
you
if
the
others
distrusted
me
instead
of
annoying
ursula
i
will
defend
her
instead
of
serving
minoret
i
will
try
to
defeat
his
schemes
i
live
only
to
ruin
him
to
destroy
him
i
ll
crush
him
under
foot
i
ll
dance
on
his
carcass
i
ll
make
his
bones
into
dominoes
every
wall
in
nemours
and
fontainebleau
and
rouvre
shall
blaze
with
the
letters
minoret
is
a
thief
yes
i
ll
burst
him
like
a
gun
there
we
re
allies
now
by
the
imprudence
of
that
outbreak
if
you
choose
i
ll
beg
mademoiselle
mirouet
s
pardon
and
tell
her
i
curse
the
madness
which
impelled
me
to
injure
her
it
may
do
her
good
the
abbe
and
the
justice
are
both
there
but
monsieur
bongrand
must
promise
on
his
honor
not
to
injure
my
career
i
have
a
career
wait
a
minute
said
savinien
bewildered
by
the
revelation
ursula
my
child
he
said
returning
to
the
salon
the
author
of
all
your
troubles
is
ashamed
of
his
work
he
repents
and
wishes
to
ask
your
pardon
in
presence
of
these
gentlemen
on
condition
that
all
be
what
goupil
cried
the
abbe
the
justice
and
the
doctor
all
together
keep
his
secret
said
ursula
putting
a
finger
on
her
lips
goupil
heard
the
words
saw
the
gesture
and
was
touched
mademoiselle
he
said
in
a
troubled
voice
i
wish
that
all
nemours
could
hear
me
tell
you
that
a
fatal
passion
has
bewildered
my
brain
and
led
me
to
commit
a
crime
punishable
by
the
blame
of
honest
men
what
i
say
now
i
would
be
willing
to
say
everywhere
deploring
the
harm
done
by
such
miserable
tricks
which
may
have
hastened
your
happiness
he
added
rather
maliciously
for
i
see
that
madame
de
portenduere
is
with
that
is
all
very
well
goupil
said
the
abbe
mademoiselle
forgives
you
but
you
must
not
forget
that
you
came
near
being
her
monsieur
bongrand
said
goupil
addressing
the
justice
of
peace
i
shall
negotiate
for
lecoeur
s
practice
i
hope
the
reparation
i
have
now
made
will
not
injure
me
with
you
and
that
you
will
back
my
petition
to
the
bar
and
the
bongrand
made
a
thoughtful
inclination
of
his
head
and
goupil
left
the
house
to
negotiate
on
the
best
terms
he
could
for
the
sheriff
s
practice
the
others
remained
with
ursula
and
did
their
best
to
restore
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
her
mind
already
much
relieved
by
goupil
s
confession
you
see
my
child
that
god
was
not
against
you
said
the
abbe
minoret
came
home
late
from
rouvre
about
nine
o
clock
he
was
sitting
in
the
chinese
pagoda
digesting
his
dinner
beside
his
wife
with
whom
he
was
making
plans
for
desire
s
future
desire
had
become
very
sedate
since
entering
the
magistracy
he
worked
hard
and
it
was
not
unlikely
that
he
would
succeed
the
present
procureur
du
roi
at
fontainebleau
who
they
said
was
to
be
advanced
to
melun
his
parents
felt
that
they
must
find
him
a
wife
some
poor
girl
belonging
to
an
old
and
noble
family
he
would
then
make
his
way
to
the
magistracy
of
paris
perhaps
they
could
get
him
elected
deputy
from
fontainebleau
where
zelie
was
proposing
to
pass
the
winter
after
living
at
rouvre
for
the
summer
season
minoret
inwardly
congratulating
himself
for
having
managed
his
affairs
so
well
no
longer
thought
or
cared
about
ursula
at
the
very
moment
when
the
drama
so
heedlessly
begun
by
him
was
closing
down
upon
him
in
a
terrible
manner
monsieur
de
portenduere
is
here
and
wishes
to
speak
to
you
said
cabirolle
show
him
in
answered
zelie
the
twilight
shadows
prevented
madame
minoret
from
noticing
the
sudden
pallor
of
her
husband
who
shuddered
as
he
heard
savinien
s
boots
on
the
floor
of
the
gallery
where
the
doctor
s
library
used
to
be
a
vague
presentiment
of
danger
ran
through
the
robber
s
veins
savinien
entered
and
remaining
standing
with
his
hat
on
his
head
his
cane
in
his
hand
and
both
hands
crossed
in
front
of
him
motionless
before
the
husband
and
wife
i
have
come
to
ascertain
monsieur
and
madame
minoret
he
said
your
reasons
for
tormenting
in
an
infamous
manner
a
young
lady
who
as
the
whole
town
knows
is
to
be
my
wife
why
have
you
endeavored
to
tarnish
her
honor
why
have
you
wished
to
kill
her
why
did
you
deliver
her
over
to
goupil
s
insults
answer
how
absurd
you
are
monsieur
savinien
said
zelie
to
come
and
ask
us
the
meaning
of
a
thing
we
think
inexplicable
i
bother
myself
as
little
about
ursula
as
i
do
about
the
year
one
since
uncle
minoret
died
i
ve
not
thought
of
her
more
than
i
do
of
my
first
tooth
i
ve
never
said
one
word
about
her
to
goupil
who
is
moreover
a
queer
rogue
whom
i
wouldn
t
think
of
consulting
about
even
a
dog
why
don
t
you
speak
up
minoret
are
you
going
to
let
monsieur
box
your
ears
in
that
way
and
accuse
you
of
wickedness
that
s
beneath
you
as
if
a
man
with
thousand
francs
a
year
from
landed
property
and
a
castle
fit
for
a
prince
would
stoop
to
such
things
get
up
and
don
t
sit
there
like
a
wet
rag
i
don
t
know
what
monsieur
means
said
minoret
in
his
squeaking
voice
the
trembling
of
which
was
all
the
more
noticeable
because
the
voice
was
clear
what
object
could
i
have
in
persecuting
the
girl
i
may
have
said
to
goupil
how
annoyed
i
was
at
seeing
her
in
nemours
my
son
desire
fell
in
love
with
her
and
i
didn
t
want
him
to
marry
her
that
s
goupil
has
confessed
everything
monsieur
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
but
it
was
terrible
when
all
three
persons
examined
one
another
zelie
saw
a
nervous
quiver
on
the
heavy
face
of
her
colossus
though
you
are
only
insects
said
the
young
nobleman
i
will
make
you
feel
my
vengeance
it
is
not
from
you
monsieur
minoret
a
man
years
of
age
but
from
your
son
that
i
shall
seek
satisfaction
for
the
insults
offered
to
mademoiselle
mirouet
the
first
time
he
sets
his
foot
in
nemours
we
shall
meet
he
must
fight
me
he
will
do
so
or
be
dishonored
and
never
dare
to
show
his
face
again
if
he
does
not
come
to
nemours
i
shall
go
to
fontainebleau
for
i
will
have
satisfaction
it
shall
never
be
said
that
you
were
tamely
allowed
to
dishonor
a
defenceless
young
girl
but
the
calumnies
of
a
goupil
are
not
began
minoret
do
you
wish
me
to
bring
him
face
to
face
with
you
believe
me
you
had
better
hush
up
this
affair
it
lies
between
you
and
goupil
and
me
leave
it
as
it
is
god
will
decide
between
us
and
when
i
meet
your
but
this
sha
n
t
go
one
cried
zelie
do
you
suppose
i
ll
stand
by
and
let
desire
fight
you
a
sailor
whose
business
it
is
to
handle
swords
and
guns
if
you
ve
got
any
cause
of
complaint
against
minoret
there
s
minoret
take
minoret
fight
minoret
but
do
you
think
my
boy
who
by
your
own
account
knew
nothing
of
all
this
is
going
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
no
my
little
gentleman
somebody
s
teeth
will
pin
your
legs
first
come
minoret
don
t
stand
staring
there
like
a
big
canary
you
are
in
your
own
house
and
you
allow
a
man
to
keep
his
hat
on
before
your
wife
i
say
he
shall
go
now
monsieur
be
off
a
man
s
house
is
his
castle
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
with
your
nonsense
but
show
me
your
heels
and
if
you
dare
touch
desire
you
ll
have
to
answer
to
you
and
your
minx
she
rang
the
bell
violently
and
called
to
the
servants
remember
what
i
have
said
to
you
repeated
savinien
to
minoret
paying
no
attention
to
zelie
s
tirade
suspending
the
sword
of
damocles
over
their
heads
he
left
the
room
now
then
minoret
said
zelie
you
will
explain
to
me
what
this
all
means
a
young
man
doesn
t
rush
into
a
house
and
make
an
uproar
like
that
and
demand
the
blood
of
a
family
for
it
s
some
mischief
of
that
vile
goupil
said
the
colossus
i
promised
to
help
him
buy
a
practice
if
he
would
get
me
the
rouvre
property
cheap
i
gave
him
ten
per
cent
on
the
cost
twenty
thousand
francs
in
a
note
and
i
suppose
he
isn
t
yes
but
why
did
he
get
up
those
serenades
and
the
scandals
against
ursula
he
wanted
to
marry
a
girl
without
a
penny
the
sly
thing
now
minoret
you
are
telling
me
lies
and
you
are
too
much
of
a
fool
my
son
to
make
me
believe
them
there
is
something
under
all
this
and
you
are
going
to
tell
me
what
it
there
s
nothing
i
tell
you
you
lie
and
i
shall
find
it
do
let
me
alone
i
ll
turn
the
faucet
of
that
fountain
of
venom
goupil
whom
you
re
afraid
of
and
we
ll
see
who
gets
the
best
of
it
just
as
you
i
know
very
well
it
will
be
as
i
choose
and
what
i
choose
first
and
foremost
is
that
no
harm
shall
come
to
desire
if
anything
happens
to
him
mark
you
i
ll
do
something
that
may
send
me
to
the
scaffold
and
you
you
haven
t
any
feeling
about
him
a
quarrel
thus
begun
between
minoret
and
his
wife
was
sure
not
to
end
without
a
long
and
angry
strife
so
at
the
moment
of
his
the
foolish
robber
found
his
inward
struggle
against
himself
and
against
ursula
revived
by
his
own
fault
and
complicated
with
a
new
and
terrible
adversary
the
next
day
when
he
left
the
house
early
to
find
goupil
and
try
to
appease
him
with
additional
money
the
walls
were
already
placarded
with
the
words
minoret
is
a
all
those
whom
he
met
commiserated
him
and
asked
him
who
was
the
author
of
the
anonymous
placard
fortunately
for
him
everybody
made
allowance
for
his
equivocal
replies
by
reflecting
on
his
utter
stupidity
fools
get
more
advantage
from
their
weakness
than
able
men
from
their
strength
the
world
looks
on
at
a
great
man
battling
against
fate
and
does
not
help
him
but
it
supplies
the
capital
of
a
grocer
who
may
fail
and
lose
all
why
because
men
like
to
feel
superior
in
protecting
an
incapable
and
are
displeased
at
not
feeling
themselves
the
equal
of
a
man
of
genius
a
clever
man
would
have
been
lost
in
public
estimation
had
he
stammered
as
minoret
did
evasive
and
foolish
answers
with
a
frightened
air
zelie
sent
her
servants
to
efface
the
vindictive
words
wherever
they
were
found
but
the
effect
of
them
on
minoret
s
conscience
still
remained
the
result
of
his
interview
with
his
assailant
was
soon
apparent
though
goupil
had
concluded
his
bargain
with
the
sheriff
the
night
before
he
now
impudently
refused
to
fulfil
it
my
dear
lecoeur
he
said
i
am
unexpectedly
enabled
to
buy
up
monsieur
dionis
s
practice
i
am
therefore
in
a
position
to
help
you
to
sell
to
others
tear
up
the
agreement
it
s
only
the
loss
of
two
stamps
here
are
seventy
lecoeur
was
too
much
afraid
of
goupil
to
complain
all
nemours
knew
before
night
that
minoret
had
given
dionis
security
to
enable
goupil
to
buy
his
practice
the
latter
wrote
to
savinien
denying
his
charges
against
minoret
and
telling
the
young
nobleman
that
in
his
new
position
he
was
forbidden
by
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
and
also
by
his
respect
for
law
to
fight
a
duel
but
he
warned
savinien
to
treat
him
well
in
future
assuring
him
he
was
a
capital
boxer
and
would
break
his
leg
at
the
first
offence
the
walls
of
nemours
were
cleared
of
the
inscription
but
the
quarrel
between
minoret
and
his
wife
went
on
and
savinien
maintained
a
threatening
silence
ten
days
after
these
events
the
marriage
of
mademoiselle
massin
the
elder
to
the
future
notary
was
bruited
about
the
town
mademoiselle
massin
had
a
dowry
of
eighty
thousand
francs
and
her
own
peculiar
ugliness
goupil
had
his
deformities
and
his
practice
the
union
therefore
seemed
suitable
and
probable
one
evening
towards
midnight
two
unknown
men
seized
goupil
in
the
street
as
he
was
leaving
massin
s
house
gave
him
a
sound
beating
and
disappeared
the
notary
kept
the
matter
a
profound
secret
and
even
contradicted
an
old
woman
who
saw
the
scene
from
her
window
and
thought
that
she
recognized
him
these
great
little
events
were
carefully
studied
by
bongrand
who
became
convinced
that
goupil
held
some
mysterious
power
over
minoret
and
he
determined
to
find
out
its
cause
chapter
xix
apparitions
though
the
public
opinion
of
the
little
town
recognized
ursula
s
perfect
innocence
she
recovered
slowly
while
in
a
state
of
bodily
exhaustion
which
left
her
mind
and
spirit
free
she
became
the
medium
of
phenomena
the
effects
of
which
were
astounding
and
of
a
nature
to
challenge
science
if
science
had
been
brought
into
contact
with
them
ten
days
after
madame
de
portenduere
s
visit
ursula
had
a
dream
with
all
the
characteristics
of
a
supernatural
vision
as
much
in
its
moral
aspects
as
in
the
so
to
speak
physical
circumstances
her
godfather
appeared
to
her
and
made
a
sign
that
she
should
come
with
him
she
dressed
herself
and
followed
him
through
the
darkness
to
their
former
house
in
the
rue
des
bourgeois
where
she
found
everything
precisely
as
it
was
on
the
day
of
her
godfather
s
death
the
old
man
wore
the
clothes
that
were
on
him
the
evening
before
his
death
his
face
was
pale
his
movements
caused
no
sound
nevertheless
ursula
heard
his
voice
distinctly
though
it
was
feeble
and
as
if
repeated
by
a
distant
echo
the
doctor
conducted
his
child
as
far
as
the
chinese
pagoda
where
he
made
her
lift
the
marble
top
of
the
little
boule
cabinet
just
as
she
had
raised
it
on
the
day
of
his
death
but
instead
of
finding
nothing
there
she
saw
the
letter
her
godfather
had
told
her
to
fetch
she
opened
it
and
read
both
the
letter
addressed
to
herself
and
the
will
in
favor
of
savinien
the
writing
as
she
afterwards
told
the
abbe
shone
as
if
traced
by
sunbeams
it
burned
my
eyes
she
said
when
she
looked
at
her
uncle
to
thank
him
she
saw
the
old
benevolent
smile
upon
his
discolored
lips
then
in
a
feeble
voice
but
still
clearly
he
told
her
to
look
at
minoret
who
was
listening
in
the
corridor
to
what
he
said
to
her
and
next
slipping
the
lock
of
the
library
door
with
his
knife
and
taking
the
papers
from
the
study
with
his
right
hand
the
old
man
seized
his
goddaughter
and
obliged
her
to
walk
at
the
pace
of
death
and
follow
minoret
to
his
own
house
ursula
crossed
the
town
entered
the
post
house
and
went
into
zelie
s
old
room
where
the
spectre
showed
her
minoret
unfolding
the
letters
reading
them
and
burning
them
he
could
not
said
ursula
telling
her
dream
to
the
abbe
light
the
first
two
matches
but
the
third
took
fire
he
burned
the
papers
and
buried
their
remains
in
the
ashes
then
my
godfather
brought
me
back
to
our
house
and
i
saw
slipping
into
the
library
where
he
took
from
the
third
volume
of
pandects
three
certificates
of
twelve
thousand
francs
each
also
from
the
preceding
volume
a
number
of
banknotes
he
is
said
my
godfather
the
cause
of
all
the
trouble
which
has
brought
you
to
the
verge
of
the
tomb
but
god
wills
that
you
shall
yet
be
happy
you
will
not
die
now
you
will
marry
savinien
if
you
love
me
and
if
you
love
savinien
i
charge
you
to
demand
your
fortune
from
my
nephew
swear
resplendent
as
though
transfigured
the
spectre
had
so
powerful
an
influence
on
ursula
s
soul
that
she
promised
all
her
uncle
asked
hoping
to
put
an
end
to
the
nightmare
she
woke
suddenly
and
found
herself
standing
in
the
middle
of
her
bedroom
facing
her
godfather
s
portrait
which
had
been
placed
there
during
her
illness
she
went
back
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
after
much
agitation
and
on
waking
again
she
remembered
all
the
particulars
of
this
singular
vision
but
she
dared
not
speak
of
it
her
judgment
and
her
delicacy
both
shrank
from
revealing
a
dream
the
end
and
object
of
which
was
her
pecuniary
benefit
she
attributed
the
vision
not
unnaturally
to
remarks
made
by
la
bougival
the
preceding
evening
when
the
old
woman
talked
of
the
doctor
s
intended
liberality
and
of
her
own
convictions
on
that
subject
but
the
dream
returned
with
aggravated
circumstances
which
made
it
fearful
to
the
poor
girl
on
the
second
occasion
the
icy
hand
of
her
godfather
was
laid
upon
her
shoulder
causing
her
the
most
horrible
distress
an
indefinable
sensation
you
must
obey
the
dead
he
said
in
a
sepulchral
voice
tears
said
ursula
relating
her
dreams
fell
from
his
white
the
third
time
the
vision
came
the
dead
man
took
her
by
the
braids
of
her
long
hair
and
showed
her
the
post
master
talking
with
goupil
and
promising
money
if
he
would
remove
ursula
to
sens
ursula
then
decided
to
relate
the
three
dreams
to
the
abbe
chaperon
monsieur
l
abbe
she
said
do
you
believe
that
the
dead
reappear
my
child
sacred
history
profane
history
and
modern
history
have
much
testimony
to
that
effect
but
the
church
has
never
made
it
an
article
of
faith
and
as
for
science
in
france
science
laughs
at
the
what
do
believe
that
the
power
of
god
is
did
my
godfather
ever
speak
to
you
of
such
matters
yes
often
he
had
entirely
changed
his
views
of
them
his
conversion
as
he
told
me
at
least
twenty
times
dated
from
the
day
when
a
woman
in
paris
heard
you
praying
for
him
in
nemours
and
saw
the
red
dot
you
made
against
s
day
in
your
ursula
uttered
a
piercing
cry
which
alarmed
the
priest
she
remembered
the
scene
when
on
returning
to
nemours
her
godfather
read
her
soul
and
took
away
the
almanac
if
that
is
so
she
said
then
my
visions
are
possibly
true
my
godfather
has
appeared
to
me
as
jesus
appeared
to
his
disciples
he
was
wrapped
in
yellow
light
he
spoke
to
me
i
beg
you
to
say
a
mass
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
and
to
implore
the
help
of
god
that
these
visions
may
cease
for
they
are
destroying
she
then
related
the
three
dreams
with
all
their
details
insisting
on
the
truth
of
what
she
said
on
her
own
freedom
of
action
on
the
somnambulism
of
her
inner
being
which
she
said
detached
itself
from
her
body
at
the
bidding
of
the
spectre
and
followed
him
with
perfect
ease
the
thing
that
most
surprised
the
abbe
to
whom
ursula
s
veracity
was
known
was
the
exact
description
which
she
gave
of
the
bedroom
formerly
occupied
by
zelie
at
the
post
house
which
ursula
had
never
entered
and
about
which
no
one
had
ever
spoken
to
her
by
what
means
can
these
singular
apparitions
take
place
asked
ursula
what
did
my
godfather
think
your
godfather
my
dear
child
argued
my
hypothesis
he
recognized
the
possibility
of
a
spiritual
world
a
world
of
ideas
if
ideas
are
of
man
s
creation
if
they
subsist
in
a
life
of
their
own
they
must
have
forms
which
our
external
senses
can
not
grasp
but
which
are
perceptible
to
our
inward
senses
when
brought
under
certain
conditions
thus
your
godfather
s
ideas
might
so
enfold
you
that
you
would
clothe
them
with
his
bodily
presence
then
if
minoret
really
committed
those
actions
they
too
resolve
themselves
into
ideas
for
all
action
is
the
result
of
many
ideas
now
if
ideas
live
and
move
in
a
spiritual
world
your
spirit
must
be
able
to
perceive
them
if
it
penetrates
that
world
these
phenomena
are
not
more
extraordinary
than
those
of
memory
and
those
of
memory
are
quite
as
amazing
and
inexplicable
as
those
of
the
perfume
of
plants
which
are
perhaps
the
ideas
of
the
how
you
enlarge
and
magnify
the
world
exclaimed
ursula
but
to
hear
the
dead
speak
to
see
them
walk
act
do
you
think
it
possible
in
sweden
replied
the
abbe
swedenborg
has
proved
by
evidence
that
he
communicated
with
the
dead
but
come
with
me
into
the
library
and
you
shall
read
in
the
life
of
the
famous
duc
de
montmorency
beheaded
at
toulouse
and
who
certainly
was
not
a
man
to
invent
foolish
tales
an
adventure
very
like
yours
which
happened
a
hundred
years
earlier
at
ursula
and
the
abbe
went
upstairs
and
the
good
man
hunted
up
a
little
edition
in
printed
in
paris
in
of
the
history
of
henri
de
montmorency
written
by
a
priest
of
that
period
who
had
known
the
prince
read
it
said
the
abbe
giving
ursula
the
volume
which
he
had
opened
at
the
page
your
godfather
often
that
passage
and
see
here
s
a
little
of
his
snuff
in
and
he
not
here
said
ursula
taking
the
volume
to
read
the
passage
the
siege
of
privat
was
remarkable
for
the
loss
of
a
great
number
of
officers
two
died
there
namely
the
marquis
d
uxelles
of
a
wound
received
at
the
outposts
and
the
marquis
de
portes
from
a
through
the
head
the
day
the
latter
was
killed
he
was
to
have
been
made
a
marshal
of
france
about
the
moment
when
the
marquis
expired
the
duc
de
montmorency
who
was
sleeping
in
his
tent
was
awakened
by
a
voice
like
that
of
the
marquis
bidding
him
farewell
the
affection
he
felt
for
a
friend
so
near
made
him
attribute
the
illusion
of
this
dream
to
the
force
of
his
own
imagination
and
owing
to
the
fatigues
of
the
night
which
he
had
spent
according
to
his
custom
in
the
trenches
he
fell
asleep
once
more
without
any
sense
of
dread
but
the
same
voice
disturbed
him
again
and
the
phantom
obliged
him
to
wake
up
and
listen
to
the
same
words
it
had
said
as
it
first
passed
the
duke
then
recollected
that
he
had
heard
the
philosopher
pitrat
discourse
on
the
possibility
of
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
and
that
he
and
the
marquis
had
agreed
that
the
first
who
died
should
bid
adieu
to
the
other
on
which
not
being
able
to
restrain
his
fears
as
to
the
truth
of
this
warning
he
sent
a
servant
to
the
marquis
s
quarters
which
were
distant
from
him
but
before
the
man
could
get
back
the
king
sent
to
inform
the
duke
by
persons
fitted
to
console
him
of
the
great
loss
he
had
sustained
i
leave
learned
men
to
discuss
the
cause
of
this
event
which
i
have
frequently
heard
the
duc
de
montmorency
relate
i
think
that
the
truth
and
singularity
of
the
fact
itself
ought
to
be
recorded
and
if
all
this
is
so
said
ursula
what
ought
i
do
do
my
child
said
the
abbe
it
concerns
matters
so
important
and
which
may
prove
so
profitable
to
you
that
you
ought
to
keep
absolutely
silent
about
it
now
that
you
have
confided
to
me
the
secret
of
these
apparitions
perhaps
they
may
not
return
besides
you
are
now
strong
enough
to
come
to
church
well
then
come
and
thank
god
and
pray
to
him
for
the
repose
of
your
godfather
s
soul
feel
quite
sure
that
you
have
entrusted
your
secret
to
prudent
if
you
knew
how
afraid
i
am
to
go
to
sleep
what
glances
my
godfather
gives
me
the
last
time
he
caught
hold
of
my
dress
i
awoke
with
my
face
all
covered
with
be
at
peace
he
will
not
come
again
said
the
priest
without
losing
a
moment
the
abbe
chaperon
went
straight
to
minoret
and
asked
for
a
few
moments
interview
in
the
chinese
pagoda
requesting
that
they
might
be
entirely
alone
can
any
one
hear
us
he
asked
no
one
replied
minoret
monsieur
my
character
must
be
known
to
you
said
the
abbe
fastening
a
gentle
but
attentive
look
on
minoret
s
face
i
have
to
speak
to
you
of
serious
and
extraordinary
matters
which
concern
you
and
about
which
you
may
be
sure
that
i
shall
keep
the
profoundest
secrecy
but
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
do
otherwise
than
give
you
this
information
while
your
uncle
lived
there
stood
there
said
the
priest
pointing
to
a
certain
spot
in
the
room
a
small
buffet
made
by
boule
with
a
marble
top
minoret
turned
livid
and
beneath
the
marble
your
uncle
placed
a
letter
for
ursula
the
abbe
then
went
on
to
relate
without
omitting
the
smallest
circumstance
minoret
s
conduct
to
minoret
himself
when
the
last
post
master
heard
the
detail
of
the
two
matches
refusing
to
light
he
felt
his
hair
begin
to
writhe
on
his
skull
who
invented
such
nonsense
he
said
in
a
strangled
voice
when
the
tale
ended
the
dead
man
this
answer
made
minoret
tremble
for
he
himself
had
dreamed
of
the
doctor
god
is
very
good
monsieur
l
abbe
to
do
miracles
for
me
he
said
danger
inspiring
him
to
make
the
sole
jest
of
his
life
all
that
god
does
is
natural
replied
the
priest
your
phantoms
don
t
frighten
me
said
the
colossus
recovering
his
coolness
i
did
not
come
to
frighten
you
for
i
shall
never
speak
of
this
to
any
one
in
the
world
said
the
abbe
you
alone
know
the
truth
the
matter
is
between
you
and
come
now
monsieur
l
abbe
do
you
really
think
me
capable
of
such
a
horrible
abuse
of
confidence
i
believe
only
in
crimes
which
are
confessed
to
me
and
of
which
the
sinner
repents
said
the
priest
in
an
apostolic
tone
crime
cried
minoret
a
crime
frightful
in
its
what
consequences
in
the
fact
that
it
escapes
human
justice
the
crimes
which
are
not
expiated
here
below
will
be
punished
in
another
world
god
himself
avenges
do
you
think
god
concerns
himself
with
such
trifles
if
he
did
not
see
the
worlds
in
all
their
details
at
a
glance
as
you
take
a
landscape
into
your
eye
he
would
not
be
monsieur
l
abbe
will
you
give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
you
have
had
these
facts
from
my
uncle
your
uncle
has
appeared
three
times
to
ursula
and
has
told
them
and
repeated
them
to
her
exhausted
by
such
visions
she
revealed
them
to
me
privately
she
considers
them
so
devoid
of
reason
that
she
will
never
speak
of
them
you
may
make
yourself
easy
on
that
i
am
easy
on
all
points
monsieur
i
hope
you
are
said
the
old
priest
even
if
i
considered
these
warnings
absurd
i
should
still
feel
bound
to
inform
you
of
them
considering
the
singular
nature
of
the
details
you
are
an
honest
man
and
you
have
obtained
your
handsome
fortune
in
too
legal
a
way
to
wish
to
add
to
it
by
theft
besides
you
are
an
almost
primitive
man
and
you
would
be
tortured
by
remorse
we
have
within
us
be
we
savage
or
civilized
the
sense
of
what
is
right
and
this
will
not
permit
us
to
enjoy
in
peace
gains
acquired
against
the
laws
of
the
society
in
which
we
live
for
societies
are
modeled
on
the
system
god
has
ordained
for
the
universe
in
this
respect
societies
have
a
divine
origin
man
does
not
originate
ideas
he
invents
no
form
he
answers
to
the
eternal
relations
that
surround
him
on
all
sides
therefore
see
what
happens
criminals
going
to
the
scaffold
and
having
it
in
their
power
to
carry
their
secret
with
them
are
compelled
by
the
force
of
some
mysterious
power
to
make
confessions
before
their
heads
are
taken
off
therefore
monsieur
minoret
if
your
mind
is
at
ease
i
go
my
way
minoret
was
so
stupefied
that
he
allowed
the
abbe
to
find
his
own
way
out
when
he
thought
himself
alone
he
flew
into
the
fury
of
a
choleric
man
the
strangest
blasphemies
escaped
his
lips
in
which
ursula
s
name
was
mingled
with
odious
language
why
what
has
she
done
to
you
cried
zelie
who
had
slipped
in
on
tiptoe
after
seeing
the
abbe
out
of
the
house
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
his
life
minoret
drunk
with
anger
and
driven
to
extremities
by
his
wife
s
reiterated
questions
turned
upon
her
and
beat
her
so
violently
that
he
was
obliged
when
she
fell
on
the
floor
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
put
her
to
bed
himself
ashamed
of
his
act
he
was
taken
ill
and
the
doctor
bled
him
twice
when
he
appeared
again
in
the
streets
everybody
noticed
a
great
change
in
him
he
walked
alone
and
often
roamed
the
town
as
though
uneasy
when
any
one
addressed
him
he
seemed
preoccupied
in
his
mind
he
who
had
never
before
had
two
ideas
in
his
head
at
last
one
evening
he
went
up
to
monsieur
bongrand
in
the
grand
rue
the
latter
being
on
his
way
to
take
ursula
to
madame
de
portenduere
s
where
the
whist
parties
had
begun
again
monsieur
bongrand
i
have
something
important
to
say
to
my
cousin
he
said
taking
the
justice
by
the
arm
and
i
am
very
glad
you
should
be
present
for
you
can
advise
they
found
ursula
studying
she
rose
with
a
cold
and
dignified
air
as
soon
as
she
saw
minoret
my
child
monsieur
minoret
wants
to
speak
to
you
on
a
matter
of
business
said
bongrand
by
the
bye
don
t
forget
to
give
me
your
certificates
i
shall
go
to
paris
in
the
morning
and
will
draw
your
dividend
and
la
bougival
cousin
said
minoret
our
uncle
accustomed
you
to
more
luxury
than
you
have
we
can
be
very
happy
with
very
little
money
she
replied
i
thought
money
might
help
your
happiness
continued
minoret
and
i
have
come
to
offer
you
some
out
of
respect
for
the
memory
of
my
you
had
a
natural
way
of
showing
respect
for
him
said
ursula
sternly
you
could
have
left
his
house
as
it
was
and
allowed
me
to
buy
it
instead
of
that
you
put
it
at
a
high
price
hoping
to
find
some
hidden
treasure
in
but
said
minoret
evidently
troubled
if
you
had
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
you
would
be
in
a
position
to
marry
i
have
not
got
but
suppose
i
give
them
to
you
on
condition
of
your
buying
an
estate
in
brittany
near
madame
de
portenduere
you
could
then
marry
her
monsieur
minoret
said
ursula
i
have
no
claim
to
that
money
and
i
can
not
accept
it
from
you
we
are
scarcely
relations
still
less
are
we
friends
i
have
suffered
too
much
from
calumny
to
give
a
handle
for
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
that
money
what
reason
have
you
to
make
me
such
a
present
these
questions
which
i
have
a
right
to
ask
persons
will
answer
as
they
see
fit
some
would
consider
your
gift
the
reparation
of
a
wrong
and
as
such
i
choose
not
to
accept
it
your
uncle
did
not
bring
me
up
to
ignoble
feelings
i
can
accept
nothing
except
from
friends
and
i
have
no
friendship
for
then
you
refuse
cried
the
colossus
into
whose
head
the
idea
had
never
entered
that
a
fortune
could
be
rejected
i
refuse
said
ursula
but
what
grounds
have
you
for
offering
mademoiselle
ursula
such
a
fortune
asked
bongrand
looking
fixedly
at
minoret
you
have
an
idea
have
you
an
idea
well
yes
the
idea
of
getting
her
out
of
nemours
so
that
my
son
will
leave
me
in
peace
he
is
in
love
with
her
and
wants
to
marry
well
we
ll
see
about
it
said
bongrand
settling
his
spectacles
give
us
time
to
think
it
he
walked
home
with
minoret
applauding
the
solicitude
shown
by
the
father
for
his
son
s
interests
and
slightly
blaming
ursula
for
her
hasty
decision
as
soon
as
minoret
was
within
his
own
gate
bongrand
went
to
the
post
house
borrowed
a
horse
and
cabriolet
and
started
for
fontainebleau
where
he
went
to
see
the
deputy
procureur
and
was
told
that
he
was
spending
the
evening
at
the
house
of
the
bongrand
delighted
followed
him
there
desire
was
playing
whist
with
the
wife
of
the
procureur
du
roi
the
wife
of
the
and
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
in
garrison
i
come
to
bring
you
some
good
news
said
bongrand
to
desire
you
love
your
cousin
ursula
and
the
marriage
can
be
i
love
ursula
mirouet
cried
desire
laughing
where
did
you
get
that
idea
i
do
remember
seeing
her
sometimes
at
the
late
doctor
minoret
s
she
certainly
is
a
beauty
but
she
is
dreadfully
pious
i
certainly
took
notice
of
her
charms
but
i
must
say
i
never
troubled
my
head
seriously
for
that
rather
insipid
little
blonde
he
added
smiling
at
the
s
wife
who
was
a
piquante
brunette
to
use
a
term
of
the
last
century
you
are
dreaming
my
dear
monsieur
bongrand
i
thought
every
one
knew
that
my
father
was
a
lord
of
a
manor
with
a
rent
roll
of
thousand
francs
a
year
from
lands
around
his
chateau
at
rouvre
good
reasons
why
i
should
not
love
the
goddaughter
of
my
late
if
i
were
to
marry
a
girl
without
a
penny
these
ladies
would
consider
me
a
have
you
never
tormented
your
father
to
let
you
marry
ursula
you
hear
that
monsieur
said
the
justice
to
the
procureur
du
roi
who
had
been
listening
to
the
conversation
leading
him
aside
into
the
recess
of
a
window
where
they
remained
in
conversation
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
an
hour
later
bongrand
was
back
in
nemours
at
ursula
s
house
whence
he
sent
la
bougival
to
minoret
to
beg
his
attendance
the
colossus
came
at
once
mademoiselle
began
bongrand
addressing
minoret
as
he
entered
the
room
accepts
cried
minoret
interrupting
him
no
not
yet
replied
bongrand
fingering
his
glasses
i
had
scruples
as
to
your
son
s
feelings
for
ursula
has
been
much
tried
lately
about
a
supposed
lover
we
know
the
importance
of
tranquillity
can
you
swear
to
me
that
your
son
truly
loves
her
and
that
you
have
no
other
intention
than
to
preserve
our
dear
ursula
from
any
further
goupilisms
oh
i
ll
swear
to
that
cried
minoret
stop
papa
minoret
said
the
justice
taking
one
hand
from
the
pocket
of
his
trousers
to
slap
minoret
on
the
shoulder
the
colossus
trembled
don
t
swear
swear
falsely
yes
either
you
or
your
son
who
has
just
sworn
at
fontainebleau
in
presence
of
four
persons
and
the
procureur
du
roi
that
he
has
never
even
thought
of
his
cousin
ursula
you
have
other
reasons
for
offering
this
fortune
i
saw
you
were
inventing
that
tale
and
went
myself
to
fontainebleau
to
question
your
minoret
was
dumbfounded
at
his
own
folly
but
where
s
the
harm
monsieur
bongrand
in
proposing
to
a
young
relative
to
help
on
a
marriage
which
seems
to
be
for
her
happiness
and
to
invent
pretexts
to
conquer
her
reluctance
to
accept
the
minoret
whose
danger
suggested
to
him
an
excuse
which
was
almost
admissible
wiped
his
forehead
wet
with
perspiration
you
know
the
cause
of
my
refusal
said
ursula
and
i
request
you
never
to
come
here
again
though
monsieur
de
portenduere
has
not
told
me
his
reason
i
know
that
he
feels
such
contempt
for
you
such
dislike
even
that
i
can
not
receive
you
into
my
house
my
happiness
is
my
only
fortune
i
do
not
blush
to
say
so
i
shall
not
risk
it
monsieur
de
portenduere
is
only
waiting
for
my
majority
to
marry
then
the
old
saw
that
money
does
all
is
a
lie
said
minoret
looking
at
the
justice
of
peace
whose
observing
eyes
annoyed
him
so
much
he
rose
and
left
the
house
but
once
outside
he
found
the
air
as
oppressive
as
in
the
little
salon
there
must
be
an
end
put
to
this
he
said
to
himself
as
he
his
own
home
when
ursula
came
down
bring
her
certificates
and
those
of
la
bougival
she
found
monsieur
bongrand
walking
up
and
down
the
salon
with
great
strides
have
you
no
idea
what
the
conduct
of
that
huge
idiot
means
he
said
none
that
i
can
tell
she
replied
bongrand
looked
at
her
with
inquiring
surprise
then
we
have
the
same
idea
he
said
here
keep
the
number
of
your
certificates
in
case
i
lose
them
you
should
always
take
that
bongrand
himself
wrote
the
number
of
the
two
certificates
hers
and
that
of
la
bougival
and
gave
them
to
her
adieu
my
child
i
shall
be
gone
two
days
but
you
will
see
me
on
the
that
night
the
apparition
appeared
to
ursula
in
a
singular
manner
she
thought
her
bed
was
in
the
cemetery
of
nemours
and
that
her
uncle
s
grave
was
at
the
foot
of
it
the
white
stone
on
which
she
read
the
inscription
opened
like
the
cover
of
an
oblong
album
she
uttered
a
piercing
cry
but
the
doctor
s
spectre
slowly
rose
first
she
saw
his
yellow
head
with
its
fringe
of
white
hair
which
shone
as
if
surmounted
by
a
halo
beneath
the
bald
forehead
the
eyes
were
like
two
gleams
of
light
the
dead
man
rose
as
if
impelled
by
some
superior
force
or
will
ursula
s
body
trembled
her
flesh
was
like
a
burning
garment
and
there
was
as
she
subsequently
said
another
self
moving
within
her
bodily
presence
mercy
she
cried
mercy
godfather
it
is
too
late
he
said
in
the
voice
of
death
to
use
the
poor
girl
s
own
expression
when
she
related
this
new
dream
to
the
abbe
he
has
been
warned
he
has
paid
no
heed
to
the
warning
the
days
of
his
son
are
numbered
if
he
does
not
confess
all
and
restore
what
he
has
taken
within
a
certain
time
he
must
lose
his
son
who
will
die
a
violent
and
horrible
death
let
him
know
the
spectre
pointed
to
a
line
of
figures
which
gleamed
upon
the
side
of
the
tomb
as
if
written
with
fire
and
said
there
is
his
when
her
uncle
lay
down
again
in
his
grave
ursula
heard
the
sound
of
the
stone
falling
back
into
its
place
and
immediately
after
in
the
distance
a
strange
sound
of
horses
and
the
cries
of
men
the
next
day
ursula
was
prostrate
she
could
not
rise
so
terribly
had
the
dream
overcome
her
she
begged
her
nurse
to
find
the
abbe
chaperon
and
bring
him
to
her
the
good
priest
came
as
soon
as
he
had
said
mass
but
he
was
not
surprised
at
ursula
s
revelation
he
believed
the
robbery
had
been
committed
and
no
longer
tried
to
explain
to
himself
the
abnormal
condition
of
his
little
he
left
ursula
at
once
and
went
directly
to
minoret
s
monsieur
l
abbe
said
zelie
my
husband
s
temper
is
so
soured
i
don
t
know
what
he
mightn
t
do
until
now
he
s
been
a
child
but
for
the
last
two
months
he
s
not
the
same
man
to
get
angry
enough
to
strike
me
me
so
gentle
there
must
be
something
dreadful
the
matter
to
change
him
like
that
you
ll
find
him
among
the
rocks
he
spends
all
his
time
there
doing
what
i
d
like
to
know
in
spite
of
the
heat
it
was
then
september
the
abbe
crossed
the
canal
and
took
a
path
which
led
to
the
base
of
one
of
the
rocks
where
he
saw
minoret
you
are
greatly
troubled
monsieur
minoret
said
the
priest
going
up
to
him
you
belong
to
me
because
you
suffer
unhappily
i
come
to
increase
your
pain
ursula
had
a
terrible
dream
last
night
your
uncle
lifted
the
stone
from
his
grave
and
came
forth
to
prophecy
a
great
disaster
in
your
family
i
certainly
am
not
here
to
frighten
you
but
you
ought
to
know
what
he
said
i
can
t
be
easy
anywhere
monsieur
chaperon
not
even
among
these
rocks
and
i
m
sure
i
don
t
want
to
know
anything
that
is
going
on
in
another
then
i
will
leave
you
monsieur
i
did
not
take
this
hot
walk
for
pleasure
said
the
abbe
mopping
his
forehead
well
what
do
you
want
to
say
demanded
minoret
you
are
threatened
with
the
loss
of
your
son
if
the
dead
man
told
things
that
you
alone
know
one
must
needs
tremble
when
he
tells
things
that
no
one
can
know
till
they
happen
make
restitution
i
say
make
restitution
don
t
damn
your
soul
for
a
little
restitution
of
what
the
fortune
the
doctor
intended
for
ursula
you
took
those
three
certificates
i
know
it
now
you
began
by
persecuting
that
poor
girl
and
you
end
by
offering
her
a
fortune
you
have
stumbled
into
lies
you
have
tangled
yourself
up
in
this
net
and
you
are
taking
false
steps
every
day
you
are
very
clumsy
and
unskilful
your
accomplice
goupil
has
served
you
ill
he
simply
laughs
at
you
make
haste
and
clear
your
mind
for
you
are
watched
by
intelligent
and
penetrating
eyes
those
of
ursula
s
friends
make
restitution
and
if
you
do
not
save
your
son
who
may
not
really
be
threatened
you
will
save
your
soul
and
you
will
save
your
honor
do
you
believe
that
in
a
society
like
ours
in
a
little
town
like
this
where
everybody
s
eyes
are
everywhere
and
all
things
are
guessed
and
all
things
are
known
you
can
long
hide
a
stolen
fortune
come
my
son
an
innocent
man
wouldn
t
have
let
me
talk
so
go
to
the
devil
cried
minoret
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
persecuting
me
i
prefer
these
stones
they
leave
me
in
farewell
then
i
have
warned
you
neither
the
poor
girl
nor
i
have
said
a
single
word
about
this
to
any
living
person
but
take
care
there
is
a
man
who
has
his
eye
upon
you
may
god
have
pity
upon
you
the
abbe
departed
presently
he
turned
back
to
look
at
minoret
the
man
was
holding
his
head
in
his
hands
as
if
it
troubled
him
he
was
in
fact
partly
crazy
in
the
first
place
he
had
kept
the
three
certificates
because
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
he
dared
not
draw
the
money
himself
for
fear
it
should
be
noticed
he
did
not
wish
to
sell
them
and
was
still
trying
to
find
some
way
of
transferring
the
certificates
in
this
horrible
state
of
uncertainty
he
bethought
him
of
acknowledging
all
to
his
wife
and
getting
her
advice
zelie
who
always
managed
affairs
for
him
so
well
she
could
get
him
out
of
his
troubles
the
funds
were
now
selling
at
eighty
restitution
why
that
meant
with
arrearages
giving
up
a
million
give
up
a
million
when
there
was
no
one
who
could
know
that
he
had
taken
it
so
minoret
continued
through
september
and
a
part
of
october
irresolute
and
a
prey
to
his
torturing
thoughts
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
little
town
he
grew
thin
and
haggard
chapter
xx
remorse
an
alarming
circumstance
hastened
the
confession
which
minoret
was
inclined
to
make
to
zelie
the
sword
of
damocles
began
to
move
above
their
heads
towards
the
middle
of
october
monsieur
and
madame
minoret
received
from
their
son
desire
the
following
letter
my
dear
mother
if
i
have
not
been
to
see
you
since
vacation
it
is
partly
because
i
have
been
on
duty
during
the
absence
of
my
chief
but
also
because
i
knew
that
monsieur
de
portenduere
was
waiting
my
arrival
at
nemours
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
tired
perhaps
of
seeing
his
vengeance
on
our
family
delayed
the
viscount
came
to
fontainebleau
where
he
had
appointed
one
of
his
parisian
friends
to
meet
him
having
already
obtained
the
help
of
the
vicomte
de
soulanges
commanding
the
troop
of
cavalry
here
in
garrison
he
called
upon
me
very
politely
accompanied
by
the
two
gentlemen
and
told
me
that
my
father
was
undoubtedly
the
instigator
of
the
malignant
persecutions
against
ursula
mirouet
his
future
wife
he
gave
me
proofs
and
told
me
of
goupil
s
confession
before
witnesses
he
also
told
me
of
my
father
s
conduct
first
in
refusing
to
pay
goupil
the
price
agreed
on
for
his
wicked
invention
and
next
out
of
fear
of
goupil
s
malignity
going
security
to
monsieur
dionis
for
the
price
of
his
practice
which
goupil
is
to
have
the
viscount
not
being
able
to
fight
a
man
years
of
age
and
being
determined
to
have
satisfaction
for
the
insults
offered
to
ursula
demanded
it
formally
of
me
his
determination
having
been
and
considered
could
not
be
shaken
if
i
refused
he
was
resolved
to
meet
me
in
society
before
persons
whose
esteem
i
value
and
insult
me
openly
in
france
a
coward
is
unanimously
scorned
besides
the
motives
for
demanding
reparation
should
be
explained
by
honorable
men
he
said
he
was
sorry
to
resort
to
such
extremities
his
seconds
declared
it
would
be
wiser
in
me
to
arrange
a
meeting
in
the
usual
manner
among
men
of
honor
so
that
ursula
mirouet
might
not
be
known
as
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
to
avoid
all
scandal
it
was
better
to
make
a
journey
to
the
nearest
frontier
in
short
my
seconds
met
his
yesterday
and
they
unanimously
agreed
that
i
owed
him
reparation
a
week
from
i
leave
for
geneva
with
my
two
friends
monsieur
de
portenduere
monsieur
de
soulanges
and
monsieur
de
trailles
will
meet
me
there
the
preliminaries
of
the
duel
are
settled
we
shall
fight
with
pistols
each
fires
three
times
and
after
that
no
matter
what
happens
the
affair
terminates
to
keep
this
degrading
matter
from
public
knowledge
for
i
find
it
impossible
to
justify
my
father
s
conduct
i
do
not
go
to
see
you
now
because
i
dread
the
violence
of
the
emotion
to
which
you
would
yield
and
which
would
not
be
seemly
if
i
am
to
make
my
way
in
the
world
i
must
conform
to
the
rules
of
society
if
the
son
of
a
viscount
has
a
dozen
reasons
for
fighting
a
duel
the
son
of
a
post
master
has
a
hundred
i
shall
pass
the
night
in
nemours
on
my
way
to
geneva
and
i
will
bid
you
then
after
the
reading
of
this
letter
a
scene
took
place
between
zelie
and
minoret
which
ended
in
the
latter
confessing
the
theft
and
relating
all
the
circumstances
and
the
strange
scenes
connected
with
it
even
ursula
s
dreams
the
million
fascinated
zelie
quite
as
much
as
it
did
minoret
you
stay
quietly
here
zelie
said
to
her
husband
without
the
slightest
remonstrance
against
his
folly
i
ll
manage
the
whole
thing
we
ll
keep
the
money
and
desire
shall
not
fight
a
madame
minoret
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
carried
her
son
s
letter
to
ursula
whom
she
found
alone
as
it
was
about
midday
in
spite
of
her
assurance
zelie
was
discomfited
by
the
cold
look
which
the
young
girl
gave
her
but
she
took
herself
to
task
for
her
cowardice
and
assumed
an
easy
air
here
mademoiselle
mirouet
do
me
the
kindness
to
read
that
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
she
cried
giving
ursula
her
son
s
letter
ursula
went
through
various
conflicting
emotions
as
she
read
the
letter
which
showed
her
how
truly
she
was
loved
and
what
care
savinien
took
of
the
honor
of
the
woman
who
was
to
be
his
wife
but
she
had
too
much
charity
and
true
religion
to
be
willing
to
be
the
cause
of
death
or
suffering
to
her
most
cruel
enemy
i
promise
madame
to
prevent
the
duel
you
may
feel
perfectly
easy
but
i
must
request
you
to
leave
me
this
my
dear
little
angel
can
we
not
come
to
some
better
arrangement
monsieur
minoret
and
i
have
acquired
property
about
rouvre
a
really
regal
castle
which
gives
us
thousand
francs
a
year
we
shall
give
desire
thousand
a
year
which
we
have
in
the
funds
in
all
seventy
thousand
francs
a
year
you
will
admit
that
there
are
not
many
better
matches
than
he
you
are
an
ambitious
girl
and
quite
right
too
added
zelie
seeing
ursula
s
quick
gesture
of
denial
i
have
therefore
come
to
ask
your
hand
for
desire
you
will
bear
your
godfather
s
name
and
that
will
honor
it
desire
as
you
must
have
seen
is
a
handsome
fellow
he
is
very
much
thought
of
at
fontainebleau
and
he
will
soon
be
procureur
du
roi
himself
you
are
a
coaxing
girl
and
can
easily
persuade
him
to
live
in
paris
we
will
give
you
a
fine
house
there
you
will
shine
you
will
play
a
distinguished
part
for
with
seventy
thousand
francs
a
year
and
the
salary
of
an
office
you
and
desire
can
enter
the
highest
society
consult
your
friends
you
ll
see
what
they
tell
i
need
only
consult
my
heart
ta
ta
ta
now
don
t
talk
to
me
about
that
little
savinien
you
d
pay
too
high
a
price
for
his
name
and
for
that
little
moustache
curled
up
at
the
points
like
two
hooks
and
his
black
hair
how
do
you
expect
to
manage
on
seven
thousand
francs
a
year
with
a
man
who
made
two
hundred
thousand
francs
of
debt
in
two
years
besides
though
this
is
a
thing
you
don
t
know
yet
all
men
are
alike
and
without
flattering
myself
too
much
i
may
say
that
my
desire
is
the
equal
of
a
king
s
you
forget
madame
the
danger
your
son
is
in
at
this
moment
which
can
perhaps
be
averted
only
by
monsieur
de
portenduere
s
desire
to
please
me
if
he
knew
that
you
had
made
me
these
unworthy
proposals
that
danger
might
not
be
escaped
besides
let
me
tell
you
madame
that
i
shall
be
far
happier
in
the
moderate
circumstances
to
which
you
allude
than
i
should
be
in
the
opulence
with
which
you
are
trying
to
dazzle
me
for
reasons
hitherto
unknown
but
which
will
yet
be
made
known
monsieur
minoret
by
persecuting
me
in
an
odious
manner
strengthened
the
affection
that
exists
between
monsieur
de
portenduere
and
myself
which
i
can
now
admit
because
his
mother
has
blessed
it
i
will
also
tell
you
that
this
affection
sanctioned
and
legitimate
is
life
itself
to
me
no
destiny
however
brilliant
however
lofty
could
make
me
change
i
love
without
the
possibility
of
changing
it
would
therefore
be
a
crime
if
i
married
a
man
to
whom
i
could
take
nothing
but
a
soul
that
is
savinien
s
but
madame
since
you
force
me
to
be
explicit
i
must
tell
you
that
even
if
i
did
not
love
monsieur
de
portenduere
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
bear
the
troubles
and
joys
of
life
in
the
company
of
your
son
if
monsieur
savinien
made
debts
you
have
often
paid
those
of
your
son
our
characters
have
neither
the
similarities
nor
the
differences
which
enable
two
persons
to
live
together
without
bitterness
perhaps
i
should
not
have
towards
him
the
forbearance
a
wife
owes
to
her
husband
i
should
then
be
a
trial
to
him
pray
cease
to
think
of
an
alliance
of
which
i
count
myself
quite
unworthy
and
which
i
feel
i
can
decline
without
pain
to
you
for
with
the
great
advantages
you
name
to
me
you
can
not
fail
to
find
some
girl
of
better
station
more
wealth
and
more
beauty
than
will
you
swear
to
me
said
zelie
to
prevent
these
young
men
from
taking
that
journey
and
fighting
that
duel
it
will
be
i
foresee
the
greatest
sacrifice
that
monsieur
de
portenduere
can
make
to
me
but
i
shall
tell
him
that
my
bridal
crown
must
have
no
blood
upon
well
i
thank
you
cousin
and
i
can
only
hope
you
will
be
and
i
madame
sincerely
wish
that
you
may
realize
all
your
expectations
for
the
future
of
your
these
words
struck
a
chill
to
the
heart
of
the
mother
who
suddenly
remembered
the
predictions
of
ursula
s
last
dream
she
stood
still
her
small
eyes
fixed
on
ursula
s
face
so
white
so
pure
so
beautiful
in
her
mourning
dress
for
ursula
had
risen
too
to
hasten
her
cousin
s
departure
do
you
believe
in
dreams
said
zelie
i
suffer
from
them
too
much
not
to
do
but
if
you
do
began
zelie
adieu
madame
exclaimed
ursula
bowing
to
madame
minoret
as
she
heard
the
abbe
s
entering
step
the
priest
was
surprised
to
find
madame
minoret
with
ursula
the
uneasiness
depicted
on
the
thin
and
wrinkled
face
of
the
former
post
mistress
induced
him
to
take
note
of
the
two
women
do
you
believe
in
spirits
zelie
asked
him
what
do
you
believe
in
he
answered
smiling
they
are
all
sly
thought
zelie
every
one
of
them
they
want
to
deceive
us
that
old
priest
and
the
old
justice
and
that
young
scamp
savinien
have
got
some
plan
in
their
heads
dreams
no
more
dreams
than
there
are
hairs
on
the
palm
of
my
with
two
stiff
curt
bows
she
left
the
room
i
know
why
savinien
went
to
fontainebleau
said
ursula
to
the
abbe
telling
him
about
the
duel
and
begging
him
to
use
his
influence
to
prevent
it
did
madame
minoret
offer
you
her
son
s
hand
asked
the
abbe
minoret
has
no
doubt
confessed
his
crime
to
her
added
the
priest
monsieur
bongrand
who
came
in
at
this
moment
was
told
of
the
step
taken
by
zelie
whose
hatred
to
ursula
was
well
known
to
him
he
looked
at
the
abbe
as
if
to
say
come
out
i
want
to
speak
to
you
of
ursula
without
her
hearing
savinien
must
be
told
that
you
refused
eighty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
the
dandy
of
nemours
he
said
aloud
is
it
then
a
sacrifice
she
answered
laughing
are
there
sacrifices
when
one
truly
loves
is
it
any
merit
to
refuse
the
son
of
a
man
we
all
despise
others
may
make
virtues
of
their
dislikes
but
that
ought
not
to
be
the
morality
of
a
girl
brought
up
by
a
de
jordy
and
the
abbe
and
my
dear
godfather
she
said
looking
up
at
his
portrait
bongrand
took
ursula
s
hand
and
kissed
it
do
you
know
what
madame
minoret
came
about
said
the
justice
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
street
what
asked
the
priest
looking
at
bongrand
with
an
air
that
seemed
merely
curious
she
had
some
plan
for
then
you
think
began
the
abbe
i
don
t
think
i
know
i
have
the
certainty
and
see
there
so
saying
bongrand
pointed
to
minoret
who
was
coming
towards
them
on
his
way
home
when
i
was
a
lawyer
in
the
criminal
courts
continued
bongrand
i
naturally
had
many
opportunities
to
study
remorse
but
i
have
never
seen
any
to
equal
that
of
this
man
what
gives
him
that
flaccidity
that
pallor
of
the
cheeks
where
the
skin
was
once
as
tight
as
a
drum
and
bursting
with
the
good
sound
health
of
a
man
without
a
care
what
has
put
those
black
circles
round
his
eyes
and
dulled
their
rustic
vivacity
did
you
ever
expect
to
see
lines
of
care
on
that
forehead
who
would
have
supposed
that
the
brain
of
that
colossus
could
be
excited
the
man
has
felt
his
heart
i
am
a
judge
of
remorse
just
as
you
are
a
judge
of
repentance
my
dear
abbe
that
which
i
have
hitherto
observed
has
developed
in
men
who
were
awaiting
punishment
or
enduring
it
to
get
quits
with
the
world
they
were
either
resigned
or
breathing
vengeance
but
here
is
remorse
without
expiation
remorse
pure
and
simple
fastening
on
its
prey
and
rending
the
judge
stopped
minoret
and
said
do
you
know
that
mademoiselle
mirouet
has
refused
your
son
s
hand
but
interposed
the
abbe
do
not
be
uneasy
she
will
prevent
the
ah
then
my
wife
succeeded
said
minoret
i
am
very
glad
for
it
nearly
killed
you
are
indeed
so
changed
that
you
are
no
longer
like
yourself
remarked
bongrand
minoret
looked
alternately
at
the
two
men
to
see
if
the
priest
had
betrayed
the
dreams
but
the
abbe
s
face
was
unmoved
expressing
only
a
calm
sadness
which
reassured
the
guilty
man
and
it
is
the
more
surprising
went
on
monsieur
bongrand
because
you
ought
to
be
filled
with
satisfaction
you
are
lord
of
rouvre
and
all
those
farms
and
mills
and
meadows
and
with
your
investments
in
the
funds
you
have
an
income
of
one
hundred
thousand
francs
i
haven
t
anything
in
the
funds
cried
minoret
hastily
pooh
said
bongrand
this
is
just
as
it
was
about
your
son
s
love
for
ursula
first
he
denied
it
and
now
he
asks
her
in
marriage
after
trying
to
kill
ursula
with
sorrow
you
now
want
her
for
a
my
good
friend
you
have
got
some
secret
in
your
minoret
tried
to
answer
he
searched
for
words
and
could
find
nothing
better
than
you
re
very
queer
monsieur
gentlemen
and
he
turned
with
a
slow
step
into
the
rue
des
bourgeois
he
has
stolen
the
fortune
of
our
poor
ursula
said
bongrand
but
how
can
we
ever
find
the
proof
god
may
god
has
put
into
us
the
sentiment
that
is
now
appealing
to
that
man
but
all
that
is
merely
what
is
called
presumptive
and
human
justice
requires
something
the
abbe
maintained
the
silence
of
a
priest
as
often
happens
in
similar
circumstances
he
thought
much
oftener
than
he
wished
to
think
of
the
robbery
now
almost
admitted
by
minoret
and
of
savinien
s
happiness
delayed
only
by
ursula
s
loss
of
fortune
for
the
old
lady
had
privately
owned
to
him
that
she
knew
she
had
done
wrong
in
not
consenting
to
the
marriage
in
the
doctor
s
lifetime
chapter
xxi
showing
how
difficult
it
is
to
steal
that
which
seems
very
easily
stolen
the
following
day
as
the
abbe
was
leaving
the
altar
after
saying
mass
a
thought
struck
him
with
such
force
that
it
seemed
to
him
the
utterance
of
a
voice
he
made
a
sign
to
ursula
to
wait
for
him
and
accompanied
her
home
without
having
breakfasted
my
child
he
said
i
want
to
see
the
two
volumes
your
godfather
showed
you
in
your
dreams
where
he
said
that
he
placed
those
certificates
and
ursula
and
the
abbe
went
up
to
the
library
and
took
down
the
third
volume
of
the
pandects
when
the
old
man
opened
it
he
noticed
not
without
surprise
a
mark
left
by
some
enclosure
upon
the
pages
which
still
kept
the
outline
of
the
certificate
in
the
other
volume
he
found
a
sort
of
hollow
made
by
the
presence
of
a
package
which
had
left
its
traces
on
the
two
pages
next
to
it
yes
go
up
monsieur
bongrand
la
bougival
was
heard
to
say
and
the
justice
of
the
peace
came
into
the
library
just
as
the
abbe
was
putting
on
his
spectacles
to
read
three
numbers
in
doctor
minoret
s
on
the
of
colored
paper
with
which
the
binder
had
lined
the
cover
of
the
volume
figures
which
ursula
had
just
discovered
what
s
the
meaning
of
those
figures
said
the
abbe
our
dear
doctor
was
too
much
of
a
bibliophile
to
spoil
the
of
a
valuable
volume
here
are
three
numbers
written
between
a
first
number
preceded
by
the
letter
m
and
a
last
number
preceded
by
a
what
are
you
talking
of
said
bongrand
let
me
see
that
good
god
he
cried
after
a
moment
s
examination
it
would
open
the
eyes
of
an
atheist
as
an
actual
demonstration
of
providence
human
justice
is
i
believe
the
development
of
the
divine
thought
which
hovers
over
the
he
seized
ursula
and
kissed
her
forehead
oh
my
child
you
will
be
rich
and
happy
and
all
through
me
what
is
it
exclaimed
the
abbe
oh
monsieur
cried
la
bougival
catching
bongrand
s
blue
overcoat
let
me
kiss
you
for
what
you
ve
just
explain
explain
don
t
give
us
false
hopes
said
the
abbe
if
i
bring
trouble
on
others
by
becoming
rich
said
ursula
forseeing
a
criminal
trial
i
remember
said
the
justice
interrupting
her
the
happiness
you
will
give
to
are
you
mad
said
the
abbe
no
my
dear
friend
said
bongrand
listen
the
certificates
in
the
funds
are
issued
in
series
as
many
series
as
there
are
letters
in
the
alphabet
and
each
number
bears
the
letter
of
its
series
but
the
certificates
which
are
made
out
to
bearer
can
not
have
a
letter
they
are
not
in
any
person
s
name
what
you
see
there
shows
that
the
day
the
doctor
placed
his
money
in
the
funds
he
noted
down
first
the
number
of
his
own
certificate
for
fifteen
thousand
francs
interest
which
bears
his
initial
m
next
the
numbers
of
three
inscriptions
to
bearer
these
are
without
a
letter
and
thirdly
the
certificate
of
ursula
s
share
in
the
funds
the
number
of
which
is
and
which
follows
as
you
see
that
of
the
certificate
with
lettering
this
goes
far
to
prove
that
those
numbers
are
those
of
five
certificates
of
investments
made
on
the
same
day
and
noted
down
by
the
doctor
in
case
of
loss
i
advised
him
to
take
certificates
to
bearer
for
ursula
s
fortune
and
he
must
have
made
his
own
investment
and
that
of
ursula
s
little
property
the
same
day
i
ll
go
to
dionis
s
office
and
look
at
the
inventory
if
the
number
of
the
certificate
for
his
own
investment
is
letter
m
we
may
be
sure
that
he
invested
through
the
same
broker
on
the
same
day
first
his
own
property
on
a
single
certificate
secondly
his
savings
in
three
certificates
to
bearer
numbered
but
without
the
series
letter
thirdly
ursula
s
own
property
the
transfer
books
will
show
of
course
undeniable
proofs
of
this
ha
minoret
you
deceiver
i
have
you
motus
my
children
whereupon
he
left
them
abruptly
to
reflect
with
admiration
on
the
ways
by
which
providence
had
brought
the
innocent
to
victory
the
finger
of
god
is
in
all
this
cried
the
abbe
will
they
punish
him
asked
ursula
ah
mademoiselle
cried
la
bougival
i
d
give
the
rope
to
hang
bongrand
was
already
at
goupil
s
now
the
appointed
successor
of
dionis
but
he
entered
the
office
with
a
careless
air
i
have
a
little
matter
to
verify
about
the
minoret
property
he
said
to
goupil
what
is
it
asked
the
latter
the
doctor
left
one
or
more
certificates
in
the
funds
he
left
one
for
fifteen
thousand
francs
a
year
said
goupil
i
recorded
it
then
just
look
on
the
inventory
said
bongrand
goupil
took
down
a
box
hunted
through
it
drew
out
a
paper
found
the
place
and
read
item
one
certificate
here
read
for
yourself
under
the
number
letter
do
me
the
kindness
to
let
me
have
a
copy
of
that
clause
within
an
hour
said
bongrand
what
good
is
it
to
you
asked
goupil
do
you
want
to
be
a
notary
answered
the
justice
of
peace
looking
sternly
at
dionis
s
proposed
successor
of
course
i
do
cried
goupil
i
ve
swallowed
too
many
affronts
not
to
succeed
now
i
beg
you
to
believe
monsieur
that
the
miserable
creature
once
called
goupil
has
nothing
in
common
with
maitre
goupil
notary
of
nemours
and
husband
of
mademoiselle
massin
the
two
beings
do
not
know
each
other
they
are
no
longer
even
alike
look
at
me
thus
adjured
monsieur
bongrand
took
notice
of
goupil
s
clothes
the
new
notary
wore
a
white
cravat
a
shirt
of
dazzling
whiteness
adorned
with
ruby
buttons
a
waistcoat
of
red
velvet
with
trousers
and
coat
of
handsome
black
made
in
paris
his
boots
were
neat
his
hair
carefully
combed
was
perfumed
in
short
he
was
metamorphosed
the
fact
is
you
are
another
man
said
bongrand
morally
as
well
as
physically
virtue
comes
with
practice
a
practice
besides
money
is
the
source
of
cleanliness
morally
as
well
as
physically
returned
bongrand
settling
his
spectacles
ha
monsieur
is
a
man
worth
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
ever
a
democrat
consider
me
in
future
as
an
honest
man
who
knows
what
refinement
is
and
who
intends
to
love
his
wife
said
goupil
and
what
s
more
i
shall
prevent
my
clients
from
ever
doing
dirty
well
make
haste
said
bongrand
let
me
have
that
copy
in
an
hour
and
notary
goupil
will
have
undone
some
of
the
evil
deeds
of
goupil
the
after
asking
the
nemours
doctor
to
lend
him
his
horse
and
cabriolet
he
went
back
to
ursula
s
house
for
the
two
important
volumes
and
for
her
own
certificate
of
funds
then
armed
with
the
extract
from
the
inventory
he
drove
to
fontainebleau
and
had
an
interview
with
the
procureur
du
roi
bongrand
easily
convinced
that
official
of
the
theft
of
the
three
certificates
by
one
or
other
of
the
heirs
presumably
by
minoret
his
conduct
is
explained
said
the
procureur
as
a
measure
of
precaution
the
magistrate
at
once
notified
the
treasury
to
withhold
transfer
of
the
said
certificates
and
told
bongrand
to
go
to
paris
and
ascertain
if
the
shares
had
ever
been
sold
he
then
wrote
a
polite
note
to
madame
minoret
requesting
her
presence
zelie
very
uneasy
about
her
son
s
duel
dressed
herself
at
once
had
the
horses
put
to
her
carriage
and
hurried
to
fontainebleau
the
procureur
s
plan
was
simple
enough
by
separating
the
wife
from
the
husband
and
bringing
the
terrors
of
the
law
to
bear
upon
her
he
expected
to
learn
the
truth
zelie
found
the
official
in
his
private
office
and
was
utterly
annihilated
when
he
addressed
her
as
follows
madame
he
said
i
do
not
believe
you
are
an
accomplice
in
a
theft
that
has
been
committed
upon
the
minoret
property
on
the
track
of
which
the
law
is
now
proceeding
but
you
can
spare
your
husband
the
shame
of
appearing
in
the
prisoner
s
dock
by
making
a
full
confession
of
what
you
know
about
it
the
punishment
which
your
husband
has
incurred
is
moreover
not
the
only
thing
to
be
dreaded
your
son
s
career
is
to
be
thought
of
you
must
avoid
destroying
that
half
an
hour
hence
will
be
too
late
the
police
are
already
under
orders
for
nemours
the
warrant
is
made
zelie
nearly
fainted
when
she
recovered
her
senses
she
confessed
everything
after
proving
to
her
that
she
was
in
point
of
fact
an
accomplice
the
magistrate
told
her
that
if
she
did
not
wish
to
injure
either
son
or
husband
she
must
behave
with
the
utmost
prudence
you
have
now
to
do
with
me
as
an
individual
not
as
a
magistrate
he
said
no
complaint
has
been
lodged
by
the
victim
nor
has
any
publicity
been
given
to
the
theft
but
your
husband
has
committed
a
great
crime
which
may
be
brought
before
a
judge
less
inclined
than
myself
to
be
considerate
in
the
present
state
of
the
affair
i
am
obliged
to
make
you
a
prisoner
oh
in
my

he
added
seeing
that
zelie
was
about
to
faint
you
must
remember
that
my
official
duty
would
require
me
to
issue
a
warrant
at
once
and
begin
an
examination
but
i
am
acting
now
individually
as

of

continued
placing

at

desk
and
proceeding
to
dictate
the
letter

friend
i
am
arrested
and
i
have
told

which

which
you
burned
for
the
procureur

has
stopped
payment
at
the
you
will
thus
save
him
from
the
denials
he
would
otherwise
attempt
to
make
said
the
magistrate
smiling
at
zelie
s
orthography
we
will
see
that
the
restitution
is
properly
made
my
wife
will
make
your
stay
in
our
house
as
agreeable
as
possible
i
advise
you
to
say
nothing
of
the
matter
and
not
to
appear
anxious
or
now
that
zelie
had
confessed
and
was
safely
immured
the
magistrate
sent
for
desire
told
him
all
the
particulars
of
his
father
s
theft
which
was
really
to
ursula
s
injury
but
as
matters
stood
legally
to
that
of
his
and
showed
him
the
letter
written
by
his
mother
desire
at
once
asked
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
nemours
and
see
that
his
father
made
immediate
restitution
it
is
a
very
serious
matter
said
the
magistrate
the
will
having
been
destroyed
if
the
matter
gets
wind
the
massin
and
cremiere
may
put
in
a
claim
i
have
proof
enough
against
your
father
i
will
release
your
mother
for
i
think
the
little
ceremony
that
has
already
taken
place
has
been
sufficient
warning
as
to
her
duty
to
her
i
will
seem
to
have
yielded
to
your
entreaties
in
releasing
her
take
her
with
you
to
nemours
and
manage
the
whole
matter
as
best
you
can
don
t
fear
any
one
monsieur
bongrand
loves
ursula
mirouet
too
well
to
let
the
matter
become
zelie
and
desire
started
soon
after
for
nemours
three
hours
later
the
procureur
du
roi
received
by
a
mounted
messenger
the
following
letter
the
orthography
of
which
has
been
corrected
so
as
not
to
bring
ridicule
on
a
man
crushed
by
affliction
to
monsieur
le
procureur
du
roi
at
fontainebleau
monsieur
god
is
less
kind
to
us
than
you
we
have
met
with
an
irreparable
misfortune
when
my
wife
and
son
reached
the
bridge
at
nemours
a
trace
became
unhooked
there
was
no
servant
behind
the
carriage
the
horses
smelt
the
stable
my
son
fearing
their
impatience
jumped
down
to
hook
the
trace
rather
than
have
the
coachman
leave
the
box
as
he
turned
to
resume
his
place
in
the
carriage
beside
his
mother
the
horses
started
desire
did
not
step
back
against
the
parapet
in
time
the
step
of
the
carriage
cut
through
both
legs
and
he
fell
the
hind
wheel
passing
over
his
body
the
messenger
who
goes
to
paris
for
the
best
surgeon
will
bring
you
this
letter
which
my
son
in
the
midst
of
his
sufferings
desires
me
to
write
so
as
to
let
you
know
our
entire
submission
to
your
decisions
in
the
matter
about
which
he
was
coming
to
speak
to
me
i
shall
be
grateful
to
you
to
my
dying
day
for
the
manner
in
which
you
have
acted
and
i
will
deserve
your
goodness
francois
minoret
this
cruel
event
convulsed
the
whole
town
of
nemours
the
crowds
standing
about
the
gate
of
the
minoret
house
were
the
first
to
tell
savinien
that
his
vengeance
had
been
taken
by
a
hand
more
powerful
than
his
own
he
went
at
once
to
ursula
s
house
where
he
found
both
the
abbe
and
the
young
girl
more
distressed
than
surprised
the
next
day
after
the
wounds
were
dressed
and
the
doctors
and
surgeons
from
paris
had
given
their
opinion
that
both
legs
must
be
amputated
minoret
went
pale
humbled
and
broken
down
accompanied
by
the
abbe
to
ursula
s
house
where
he
found
also
monsieur
bongrand
and
savinien
mademoiselle
he
said
i
am
very
guilty
towards
you
but
if
all
the
wrongs
i
have
done
you
are
not
wholly
reparable
there
are
some
that
i
can
expiate
my
wife
and
i
have
made
a
vow
to
make
over
to
you
in
absolute
possession
our
estate
at
rouvre
in
case
our
son
recovers
and
also
in
case
we
have
the
dreadful
sorrow
of
losing
he
burst
into
tears
as
he
said
the
last
words
i
can
assure
you
my
dear
ursula
said
the
abbe
that
you
can
and
that
you
ought
to
accept
a
part
of
this
will
you
forgive
me
said
minoret
humbly
kneeling
before
the
astonished
girl
the
operation
is
about
to
be
performed
by
the
first
surgeon
of
the
but
i
do
not
trust
to
human
science
i
rely
only
on
the
power
of
god
if
you
will
forgive
us
if
you
ask
god
to
restore
our
son
to
us
he
will
have
strength
to
bear
the
agony
and
we
shall
have
the
joy
of
saving
let
us
go
to
the
church
cried
ursula
rising
but
as
she
gained
her
feet
a
piercing
cry
came
from
her
lips
and
she
fell
backward
fainting
when
her
senses
returned
she
saw
her
friends
but
not
minoret
who
had
rushed
for
a
doctor
looking
at
her
with
anxious
eyes
seeking
an
explanation
as
she
gave
it
terror
filled
their
hearts
i
saw
my
godfather
standing
in
the
doorway
she
said
and
he
signed
to
me
that
there
was
no
the
day
after
the
operation
desire
died
carried
off
by
the
fever
and
the
shock
to
the
system
that
succeed
operations
of
this
nature
madame
minoret
whose
heart
had
no
other
tender
feeling
than
maternity
became
insane
after
the
burial
of
her
son
and
was
taken
by
her
husband
to
the
establishment
of
doctor
blanche
where
she
died
in
three
months
after
these
events
in
january
ursula
married
savinien
with
madame
de
portenduere
s
consent
minoret
took
part
in
the
marriage
contract
and
insisted
on
giving
mademoiselle
mirouet
his
estate
at
rouvre
and
an
income
of
thousand
francs
from
the
funds
keeping
for
himself
only
his
uncle
s
house
and
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
he
has
become
the
most
charitable
of
men
and
the
most
religious
he
is
churchwarden
of
the
parish
and
has
made
himself
the
providence
of
the
unfortunate
the
poor
take
the
place
of
my
son
he
said
if
you
have
ever
noticed
by
the
wayside
in
countries
where
they
poll
the
oaks
some
old
tree
whitened
and
as
if
blasted
still
throwing
out
its
twigs
though
its
trunk
is
riven
and
seems
to
implore
the
axe
you
will
have
an
idea
of
the
old
post
master
with
his
white
hair
broken
emaciated
in
whom
the
elders
of
the
town
can
see
no
trace
of
the
jovial
dullard
whom
you
first
saw
watching
for
his
son
at
the
beginning
of
this
history
he
does
not
even
take
his
snuff
as
he
once
did
he
carries
something
more
now
than
the
weight
of
his
body
beholding
him
we
feel
that
the
hand
of
god
was
laid
upon
that
figure
to
make
it
an
awful
warning
after
hating
so
violently
his
uncle
s
godchild
the
old
man
now
like
doctor
minoret
himself
has
concentrated
all
his
affections
on
her
and
has
made
himself
the
manager
of
her
property
