such

are
men

what

its

even

the

editor
preface
when
the
editor
commenced
the
preparation
of
the
following
narrative
he
did
not
suppose
it
would
reach
the
size
of
this
volume
in
order
however
to
present
all
the
facts
which
have
been
communicated
to
him
it
has
seemed
necessary
to
extend
it
to
its
present
length
many
of
the
statements
contained
in
the
following
pages
are
corroborated
by
abundant
evidence
others
rest
entirely
upon
assertion
that
he
has
adhered
strictly
to
the
truth
the
editor
at
least
who
has
had
an
opportunity
of
detecting
any
contradiction
or
discrepancy
in
his
statements
is
well
satisfied
he
has
invariably
repeated
the
same
story
without
deviating
in
the
slightest
particular
and
has
also
carefully
perused
the
manuscript
dictating
an
alteration
wherever
the
most
trivial
inaccuracy
has
appeared
it
was
solomon
fortune
during
his
captivity
to
be
owned
by
several
masters
the
treatment
he
received
while
at
the
pine
woods
shows
that
among
slaveholders
there
are
men
of
humanity
as
well
as
of
cruelty
some
of
them
are
spoken
of
with
emotions
of
gratitude
others
in
a
spirit
of
bitterness
it
is
believed
that
the
following
account
of
his
experience
on
bayou
boeuf
presents
a
correct
picture
of
slavery
in
all
its
lights
and
shadows
as
it
now
exists
in
that
locality
unbiased
as
he
conceives
by
any
prepossessions
or
prejudices
the
only
object
of
the
editor
has
been
to
give
a
faithful
history
of
solomon
northup
life
as
he
received
it
from
his
lips
in
the
accomplishment
of
that
object
he
trusts
he
has
succeeded
notwithstanding
the
numerous
faults
of
style
and
of
expression
it
may
be
found

the
beginning
of
sorrow
having
been
born
a
freeman
and
for
more
than
thirty
years
enjoyed
the
blessings
of
liberty
in
a
free
state
and
having
at
the
end
of
that
time
been
kidnapped
and
sold
into
slavery
where
i
remained
until
happily
rescued
in
the
month
of
january
after
a
bondage
of
twelve
years
it
has
been
suggested
that
an
account
of
my
life
and
fortunes
would
not
be
uninteresting
to
the
public
since
my
return
to
liberty
i
have
not
failed
to
perceive
the
increasing
interest
throughout
the
northern
states
in
regard
to
the
subject
of
slavery
works
of
fiction
professing
to
portray
its
features
in
their
more
pleasing
as
well
as
more
repugnant
aspects
have
been
circulated
to
an
extent
unprecedented
and
as
i
understand
have
created
a
fruitful
topic
of
comment
and
discussion
i
can
speak
of
slavery
only
so
far
as
it
came
under
my
own
observation
only
so
far
as
i
have
known
and
experienced
it
in
my
own
person
my
object
is
to
give
a
candid
and
truthful
statement
of
facts
to
repeat
the
story
of
my
life
without
exaggeration
leaving
it
for
others
to
determine
whether
even
the
pages
of
fiction
present
a
picture
of
more
cruel
wrong
or
a
severer
bondage
as
far
back
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
my
ancestors
on
the
paternal
side
were
slaves
in
rhode
island
they
belonged
to
a
family
by
the
name
of
northup
one
of
whom
removing
to
the
state
of
settled
at
hoosic
in
rensselaer
county
he
brought
with
him
mintus
northup
my
father
on
the
death
of
this
gentleman
which
must
have
occurred
some
fifty
years
ago
my
father
became
free
having
been
emancipated
by
a
direction
in
his
will
henry
northup
of
sandy
hill
a
distinguished
counselor
at
law
and
the
man
to
whom
under
providence
i
am
indebted
for
my
present
liberty
and
my
return
to
the
society
of
my
wife
and
children
is
a
relative
of
the
family
in
which
my
forefathers
were
thus
held
to
service
and
from
which
they
took
the
name
i
bear
to
this
fact
may
be
attributed
the
persevering
interest
he
has
taken
in
my
behalf
sometime
after
my
father
liberation
he
removed
to
the
town
of
minerva
essex
county
where
i
was
born
in
the
month
of
july
how
long
he
remained
in
the
latter
place
i
have
not
the
means
of
definitely
ascertaining
from
thence
he
removed
to
granville
washington
county
near
a
place
known
as
slyborough
where
for
some
years
he
labored
on
the
farm
of
clark
northup
also
a
relative
of
his
old
master
from
thence
he
removed
to
the
alden
farm
at
moss
street
a
short
distance
north
of
the
village
of
sandy
hill
and
from
thence
to
the
farm
now
owned
by
russel
pratt
situated
on
the
road
leading
from
fort
edward
to
argyle
where
he
continued
to
reside
until
his
death
which
took
place
on
the
day
of
november
he
left
a
widow
and
two
children
myself
and
joseph
an
elder
brother
the
latter
is
still
living
in
the
county
of
oswego
near
the
city
of
that
name
my
mother
died
during
the
period
of
my
captivity
though
born
a
slave
and
laboring
under
the
disadvantages
to
which
my
unfortunate
race
is
subjected
my
father
was
a
man
respected
for
his
industry
and
integrity
as
many
now
living
who
well
remember
him
are
ready
to
testify
his
whole
life
was
passed
in
the
peaceful
pursuits
of
agriculture
never
seeking
employment
in
those
more
menial
positions
which
seem
to
be
especially
allotted
to
the
children
of
africa
besides
giving
us
an
education
surpassing
that
ordinarily
bestowed
upon
children
in
our
condition
he
acquired
by
his
diligence
and
economy
a
sufficient
property
qualification
to
entitle
him
to
the
right
of
suffrage
he
was
accustomed
to
speak
to
us
of
his
early
life
and
although
at
all
times
cherishing
the
warmest
emotions
of
kindness
and
even
of
affection
towards
the
family
in
whose
house
he
had
been
a
bondsman
he
nevertheless
comprehended
the
system
of
slavery
and
dwelt
with
sorrow
on
the
degradation
of
his
race
he
endeavored
to
imbue
our
minds
with
sentiments
of
morality
and
to
teach
us
to
place
our
trust
and
confidence
in
him
who
regards
the
humblest
as
well
as
the
highest
of
his
creatures
how
often
since
that
time
has
the
recollection
of
his
paternal
counsels
occurred
to
me
while
lying
in
a
slave
hut
in
the
distant
and
sickly
regions
of
louisiana
smarting
with
the
undeserved
wounds
which
an
inhuman
master
had
inflicted
and
longing
only
for
the
grave
which
had
covered
him
to
shield
me
also
from
the
lash
of
the
oppressor
in
the
at
sandy
hill
an
humble
stone
marks
the
spot
where
he
reposes
after
having
worthily
performed
the
duties
appertaining
to
the
lowly
sphere
wherein
god
had
appointed
him
to
walk
up
to
this
period
i
had
been
principally
engaged
with
my
father
in
the
labors
of
the
farm
the
leisure
hours
allowed
me
were
generally
either
employed
over
my
books
or
playing
on
the
violin
an
amusement
which
was
the
ruling
passion
of
my
youth
it
has
also
been
the
source
of
consolation
since
affording
pleasure
to
the
simple
beings
with
whom
my
lot
was
cast
and
beguiling
my
own
thoughts
for
many
hours
from
the
painful
contemplation
of
my
fate
on
christmas
day
i
was
married
to
anne
hampton
a
colored
girl
then
living
in
the
vicinity
of
our
residence
the
ceremony
was
performed
at
fort
edward
by
timothy
eddy
a
magistrate
of
that
town
and
still
a
prominent
citizen
of
the
place
she
had
resided
a
long
time
at
sandy
hill
with
baird
proprietor
of
the
eagle
tavern
and
also
in
the
family
of
rev
alexander
proudfit
of
salem
this
gentleman
for
many
years
had
presided
over
the
presbyterian
society
at
the
latter
place
and
was
widely
distinguished
for
his
learning
and
piety
anne
still
holds
in
grateful
remembrance
the
exceeding
kindness
and
the
excellent
counsels
of
that
good
man
she
is
not
able
to
determine
the
exact
line
of
her
descent
but
the
blood
of
three
races
mingles
in
her
veins
it
is
difficult
to
tell
whether
the
red
white
or
black
predominates
the
union
of
them
all
however
in
her
origin
has
given
her
a
singular
but
pleasing
expression
such
as
is
rarely
to
be
seen
though
somewhat
resembling
yet
she
can
not
properly
be
styled
a
quadroon
a
class
to
which
i
have
omitted
to
mention
my
mother
belonged
i
had
just
now
passed
the
period
of
my
minority
having
reached
the
age
of
years
in
the
month
of
july
previous
deprived
of
the
advice
and
assistance
of
my
father
with
a
wife
dependent
upon
me
for
support
i
resolved
to
enter
upon
a
life
of
industry
and
notwithstanding
the
obstacle
of
color
and
the
consciousness
of
my
lowly
state
indulged
in
pleasant
dreams
of
a
good
time
coming
when
the
possession
of
some
humble
habitation
with
a
few
surrounding
acres
should
reward
my
labors
and
bring
me
the
means
of
happiness
and
comfort
from
the
time
of
my
marriage
to
this
day
the
love
i
have
borne
my
wife
has
been
sincere
and
unabated
and
only
those
who
have
felt
the
glowing
tenderness
a
father
cherishes
for
his
offspring
can
appreciate
my
affection
for
the
beloved
children
which
have
since
been
born
to
us
this
much
i
deem
appropriate
and
necessary
to
say
in
order
that
those
who
read
these
pages
may
comprehend
the
poignancy
of
those
sufferings
i
have
been
doomed
to
bear
immediately
upon
our
marriage
we
commenced
in
the
old
yellow
building
then
standing
at
the
southern
extremity
of
fort
edward
village
and
which
has
since
been
transformed
into
a
modern
mansion
and
lately
occupied
by
captain
lathrop
it
is
known
as
the
fort
house
in
this
building
the
courts
were
sometime
held
after
the
organization
of
the
county
it
was
also
occupied
by
burgoyne
in
being
situated
near
the
old
fort
on
the
left
bank
of
the
hudson
during
the
winter
i
was
employed
with
others
repairing
the
champlain
canal
on
that
section
over
which
william
van
nortwick
was
superintendent
david
mceachron
had
the
immediate
charge
of
the
men
in
whose
company
i
labored
by
the
time
the
canal
opened
in
the
spring
i
was
enabled
from
the
savings
of
my
wages
to
purchase
a
pair
of
horses
and
other
things
necessarily
required
in
the
business
of
navigation
having
hired
several
efficient
hands
to
assist
me
i
entered
into
contracts
for
the
transportation
of
large
rafts
of
timber
from
lake
champlain
to
troy
dyer
beckwith
and
a
bartemy
of
whitehall
accompanied
me
on
several
trips
during
the
season
i
became
perfectly
familiar
with
the
art
and
mysteries
of
rafting
a
knowledge
which
afterwards
enabled
me
to
render
profitable
service
to
a
worthy
master
and
to
astonish
the
lumbermen
on
the
banks
of
the
bayou
boeuf
in
one
of
my
voyages
down
lake
champlain
i
was
induced
to
make
a
visit
to
canada
repairing
to
montreal
i
visited
the
cathedral
and
other
places
of
interest
in
that
city
from
whence
i
continued
my
excursion
to
kingston
and
other
towns
obtaining
a
knowledge
of
localities
which
was
also
of
service
to
me
afterwards
as
will
appear
towards
the
close
of
this
narrative
having
completed
my
contracts
on
the
canal
satisfactorily
to
myself
and
to
my
employer
and
not
wishing
to
remain
idle
now
that
the
navigation
of
the
canal
was
again
suspended
i
entered
into
another
contract
with
medad
gunn
to
cut
a
large
quantity
of
wood
in
this
business
i
was
engaged
during
the
winter
of
with
the
return
of
spring
anne
and
myself
conceived
the
project
of
taking
a
farm
in
the
neighborhood
i
had
been
accustomed
from
earliest
youth
to
agricultural
labors
and
it
was
an
occupation
congenial
to
my
tastes
i
accordingly
entered
into
arrangements
for
a
part
of
the
old
alden
farm
on
which
my
father
formerly
resided
with
one
cow
one
swine
a
yoke
of
fine
oxen
i
had
lately
purchased
of
lewis
brown
in
hartford
and
other
personal
property
and
effects
we
proceeded
to
our
new
home
in
kingsbury
that
year
i
planted
acres
of
corn
sowed
large
fields
of
oats
and
commenced
farming
upon
as
large
a
scale
as
my
utmost
means
would
permit
anne
was
diligent
about
the
house
affairs
while
i
toiled
laboriously
in
the
field
on
this
place
we
continued
to
reside
until
in
the
winter
season
i
had
numerous
calls
to
play
on
the
violin
wherever
the
young
people
assembled
to
dance
i
was
almost
invariably
there
throughout
the
surrounding
villages
my
fiddle
was
notorious
anne
also
during
her
long
residence
at
the
eagle
tavern
had
become
somewhat
famous
as
a
cook
during
court
weeks
and
on
public
occasions
she
was
employed
at
high
wages
in
the
kitchen
at
sherrill
coffee
house
we
always
returned
home
from
the
performance
of
these
services
with
money
in
our
pockets
so
that
with
fiddling
cooking
and
farming
we
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
possession
of
abundance
and
in
fact
leading
a
happy
and
prosperous
life
well
indeed
would
it
have
been
for
us
had
we
remained
on
the
farm
at
kingsbury
but
the
time
came
when
the
next
step
was
to
be
taken
towards
the
cruel
destiny
that
awaited
me
in
march
we
removed
to
saratoga
springs
we
occupied
a
house
belonging
to
daniel
on
the
north
side
of
washington
street
at
that
time
isaac
taylor
kept
a
large
boarding
house
known
as
washington
hall
at
the
north
end
of
broadway
he
employed
me
to
drive
a
hack
in
which
capacity
i
worked
for
him
two
years
after
this
time
i
was
generally
employed
through
the
visiting
season
as
also
was
anne
in
the
united
states
hotel
and
other
public
houses
of
the
place
in
winter
seasons
i
relied
upon
my
violin
though
during
the
construction
of
the
troy
and
saratoga
railroad
i
performed
many
hard
days
labor
upon
it
i
was
in
the
habit
at
saratoga
of
purchasing
articles
necessary
for
my
family
at
the
stores
of
cephas
parker
and
william
perry
gentlemen
towards
whom
for
many
acts
of
kindness
i
entertained
feelings
of
strong
regard
it
was
for
this
reason
that
twelve
years
afterwards
i
caused
to
be
directed
to
them
the
letter
which
is
hereinafter
inserted
and
which
was
the
means
in
the
hands
of
northup
of
my
fortunate
deliverance
while
living
at
the
united
states
hotel
i
frequently
met
with
slaves
who
had
accompanied
their
masters
from
the
south
they
were
always
well
dressed
and
well
provided
for
leading
apparently
an
easy
life
with
but
few
of
its
ordinary
troubles
to
perplex
them
many
times
they
entered
into
conversation
with
me
on
the
subject
of
slavery
almost
uniformly
i
found
they
cherished
a
secret
desire
for
liberty
some
of
them
expressed
the
most
ardent
anxiety
to
escape
and
consulted
me
on
the
best
method
of
effecting
it
the
fear
of
punishment
however
which
they
knew
was
certain
to
attend
their
and
return
in
all
cases
proved
sufficient
to
deter
them
from
the
experiment
having
all
my
life
breathed
the
free
air
of
the
north
and
conscious
that
i
possessed
the
same
feelings
and
affections
that
find
a
place
in
the
white
man
breast
conscious
moreover
of
an
intelligence
equal
to
that
of
some
men
at
least
with
a
fairer
skin
i
was
too
ignorant
perhaps
too
independent
to
conceive
how
any
one
could
be
content
to
live
in
the
abject
condition
of
a
slave
i
could
not
comprehend
the
justice
of
that
law
or
that
religion
which
upholds
or
recognizes
the
principle
of
slavery
and
never
once
i
am
proud
to
say
did
i
fail
to
counsel
any
one
who
came
to
me
to
watch
his
opportunity
and
strike
for
freedom
i
continued
to
reside
at
saratoga
until
the
spring
of
the
flattering
anticipations
which
seven
years
before
had
seduced
us
from
the
quiet
on
the
east
side
of
the
hudson
had
not
been
realized
though
always
in
comfortable
circumstances
we
had
not
prospered
the
society
and
associations
at
that
watering
place
were
not
calculated
to
preserve
the
simple
habits
of
industry
and
economy
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
but
on
the
contrary
to
substitute
others
in
their
stead
tending
to
shiftlessness
and
extravagance
at
this
time
we
were
the
parents
of
three
children
elizabeth
margaret
and
alonzo
elizabeth
the
eldest
was
in
her
tenth
year
margaret
was
two
years
younger
and
little
alonzo
had
just
passed
his
fifth
they
filled
our
house
with
gladness
their
young
voices
were
music
in
our
ears
many
an
airy
castle
did
their
mother
and
myself
build
for
the
little
innocents
when
not
at
labor
i
was
always
walking
with
them
clad
in
their
best
attire
through
the
streets
and
groves
of
saratoga
their
presence
was
my
delight
and
i
clasped
them
to
my
bosom
with
as
warm
and
tender
love
as
if
their
clouded
skins
had
been
as
white
as
snow
thus
far
the
history
of
my
life
presents
nothing
whatever
unusual
nothing
but
the
common
hopes
and
loves
and
labors
of
an
obscure
colored
man
making
his
humble
progress
in
the
world
but
now
i
had
reached
a
turning
point
in
my
existence
reached
the
threshold
of
unutterable
wrong
and
sorrow
and
despair
now
had
i
approached
within
the
shadow
of
the
cloud
into
the
thick
darkness
whereof
i
was
soon
to
disappear
thenceforward
to
be
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
all
my
kindred
and
shut
out
from
the
sweet
light
of
liberty

weary

about

thinking
to
myself
where
i
might

busy

should

near

then
and
for
aught
i
know
to
the
contrary
still
kept
by
mr
moon
i
was
met
by
two
gentlemen
of
respectable
appearance
both
of
whom
were
entirely
unknown
to
me
i
have
the
impression
that
they
were
introduced
to
me
by
some
one
of
my
acquaintances
but
who
i
have
in
vain
endeavored
to
recall
with
the
remark
that
i
was
an
expert
player
on
the
violin
at
any
rate
they
immediately
entered
into
conversation
on
that
subject
making
numerous
inquiries
touching
my
proficiency
in
that
respect
my
responses
being
to
all
appearances
satisfactory
they
proposed
to
engage
my
services
for
a
short
period
stating
at
the
same
time
i
was
just
such
a
person
as
their
business
required
their
names
as
they
afterwards
gave
them
to
me
were
merrill
brown
and
abram
hamilton
though
whether
these
were
their
true
appellations
i
have
strong
reasons
to
doubt
the
former
was
a
man
apparently
forty
years
of
age
somewhat
short
and
with
a
countenance
indicating
shrewdness
and
intelligence
he
wore
a
black
frock
coat
and
black
hat
and
said
he
resided
either
at
rochester
or
at
syracuse
the
latter
was
a
young
man
of
fair
complexion
and
light
eyes
and
i
should
judge
had
not
passed
the
age
of
he
was
tall
and
slender
dressed
in
a
coat
with
glossy
hat
and
vest
of
elegant
pattern
his
whole
apparel
was
in
the
extreme
of
fashion
his
appearance
was
somewhat
effeminate
but
prepossessing
and
there
was
about
him
an
easy
air
that
showed
he
had
mingled
with
the
world
they
were
connected
as
they
informed
me
with
a
circus
company
then
in
the
city
of
washington
that
they
were
on
their
way
thither
to
rejoin
it
having
left
it
for
a
short
time
to
make
an
excursion
northward
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
the
country
and
were
paying
their
expenses
by
an
occasional
exhibition
they
also
remarked
that
they
had
found
much
difficulty
in
procuring
music
for
their
entertainments
and
that
if
i
would
accompany
them
as
far
as
they
would
give
me
one
dollar
for
each
day
services
and
three
dollars
in
addition
for
every
night
i
played
at
their
performances
besides
sufficient
to
pay
the
expenses
of
my
return
from
to
saratoga
i
at
once
accepted
the
tempting
offer
both
for
the
reward
it
promised
and
from
a
desire
to
visit
the
metropolis
they
were
anxious
to
leave
immediately
thinking
my
absence
would
be
brief
i
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
write
to
anne
whither
i
had
gone
in
fact
supposing
that
my
return
perhaps
would
be
as
soon
as
hers
so
taking
a
change
of
linen
and
my
violin
i
was
ready
to
depart
the
carriage
was
brought
round
a
covered
one
drawn
by
a
pair
of
noble
bays
altogether
forming
an
elegant
establishment
their
baggage
consisting
of
three
large
trunks
was
fastened
on
the
rack
and
mounting
to
the
driver
seat
while
they
took
their
places
in
the
rear
i
drove
away
from
saratoga
on
the
road
to
albany
elated
with
my
new
position
and
happy
as
i
had
ever
been
on
any
day
in
all
my
life
we
passed
through
ballston
and
striking
the
ridge
road
as
it
is
called
if
my
memory
correctly
serves
me
followed
it
direct
to
albany
we
reached
that
city
before
dark
and
stopped
at
a
hotel
southward
from
the
museum
this
night
i
had
an
opportunity
of
witnessing
one
of
their
performances
the
only
one
during
the
whole
period
i
was
with
them
hamilton
was
stationed
at
the
door
i
formed
the
orchestra
while
brown
provided
the
entertainment
it
consisted
in
throwing
balls
dancing
on
the
rope
frying
pancakes
in
a
hat
causing
invisible
pigs
to
squeal
and
other
like
feats
of
ventriloquism
and
legerdemain
the
audience
was
extraordinarily
sparse
and
not
of
the
selectest
character
at
that
and
hamilton
report
of
the
proceeds
presented
but
a
beggarly
account
of
empty
boxes
early
next
morning
we
renewed
our
journey
the
burden
of
their
conversation
now
was
the
expression
of
an
anxiety
to
reach
the
circus
without
delay
they
hurried
forward
without
again
stopping
to
exhibit
and
in
due
course
of
time
we
reached
taking
lodgings
at
a
house
on
the
west
side
of
the
city
in
a
street
running
from
broadway
to
the
river
i
supposed
my
journey
was
at
an
end
and
expected
in
a
day
or
two
at
least
to
return
to
my
friends
and
family
at
saratoga
brown
and
hamilton
however
began
to
importune
me
to
continue
with
them
to
washington
they
alleged
that
immediately
on
their
arrival
now
that
the
summer
season
was
approaching
the
circus
would
set
out
for
the
north
they
promised
me
a
situation
and
high
wages
if
i
would
accompany
them
largely
did
they
expatiate
on
the
advantages
that
would
result
to
me
and
such
were
the
flattering
representations
they
made
that
i
finally
concluded
to
accept
the
offer
the
next
morning
they
suggested
that
inasmuch
as
we
were
about
entering
a
slave
state
it
would
be
well
before
leaving
to
procure
free
papers
the
idea
struck
me
as
a
prudent
one
though
i
think
it
would
scarcely
have
occurred
to
me
had
they
not
proposed
it
we
proceeded
at
once
to
what
i
understood
to
be
the
custom
house
they
made
oath
to
certain
facts
showing
i
was
a
free
man
a
paper
was
drawn
up
and
handed
us
with
the
direction
to
take
it
to
the
clerk
office
we
did
so
and
the
clerk
having
added
something
to
it
for
which
he
was
paid
six
shillings
we
returned
again
to
the
custom
house
some
further
formalities
were
gone
through
with
before
it
was
completed
when
paying
the
officer
two
dollars
i
placed
the
papers
in
my
pocket
and
started
with
my
two
friends
to
our
hotel
i
thought
at
the
time
i
must
confess
that
the
papers
were
scarcely
worth
the
cost
of
obtaining
them
the
apprehension
of
danger
to
my
personal
safety
never
having
suggested
itself
to
me
in
the
remotest
manner
the
clerk
to
whom
we
were
directed
i
remember
made
a
memorandum
in
a
large
book
which
i
presume
is
in
the
office
yet
a
reference
to
the
entries
during
the
latter
part
of
march
or
first
of
april
i
have
no
doubt
will
satisfy
the
incredulous
at
least
so
far
as
this
particular
transaction
is
concerned
with
the
evidence
of
freedom
in
my
possession
the
next
day
after
our
arrival
in
we
crossed
the
ferry
to
jersey
city
and
took
the
road
to
philadelphia
here
we
remained
one
night
continuing
our
journey
towards
baltimore
early
in
the
morning
in
due
time
we
arrived
in
the
latter
city
and
stopped
at
a
hotel
near
the
railroad
depot
either
kept
by
a
rathbone
or
known
as
the
rathbone
house
all
the
way
from
their
anxiety
to
reach
the
circus
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
intense
we
left
the
carriage
at
baltimore
and
entering
the
cars
proceeded
to
washington
at
which
place
we
arrived
just
at
nightfall
the
evening
previous
to
the
funeral
of
general
harrison
and
stopped
at
gadsby
hotel
on
pennsylvania
avenue
after
supper
they
called
me
to
their
apartments
and
paid
me
dollars
a
sum
greater
than
my
wages
amounted
to
which
act
of
generosity
was
in
consequence
they
said
of
their
not
having
exhibited
as
often
as
they
had
given
me
to
anticipate
during
our
trip
from
saratoga
they
moreover
informed
me
that
it
had
been
the
intention
of
the
circus
company
to
leave
washington
the
next
morning
but
that
on
account
of
the
funeral
they
had
concluded
to
remain
another
day
they
were
then
as
they
had
been
from
the
time
of
our
first
meeting
extremely
kind
no
opportunity
was
omitted
of
addressing
me
in
the
language
of
approbation
while
on
the
other
hand
i
was
certainly
much
prepossessed
in
their
favor
i
gave
them
my
confidence
without
reserve
and
would
freely
have
trusted
them
to
almost
any
extent
their
constant
conversation
and
manner
towards
me
their
foresight
in
suggesting
the
idea
of
free
papers
and
a
hundred
other
little
acts
unnecessary
to
be
repeated
all
indicated
that
they
were
friends
indeed
sincerely
solicitous
for
my
welfare
i
know
not
but
they
were
i
know
not
but
they
were
innocent
of
the
great
wickedness
of
which
i
now
believe
them
guilty
whether
they
were
accessory
to
my
misfortunes
subtle
and
inhuman
monsters
in
the
shape
of
men
designedly
luring
me
away
from
home
and
family
and
liberty
for
the
sake
of
gold
those
who
read
these
pages
will
have
the
same
means
of
determining
as
myself
if
they
were
innocent
my
sudden
disappearance
must
have
been
unaccountable
indeed
but
revolving
in
my
mind
all
the
attending
circumstances
i
never
yet
could
indulge
towards
them
so
charitable
a
supposition
after
receiving
the
money
from
them
of
which
they
appeared
to
have
an
abundance
they
advised
me
not
to
go
into
the
streets
that
night
inasmuch
as
i
was
unacquainted
with
the
customs
of
the
city
promising
to
remember
their
advice
i
left
them
together
and
soon
after
was
shown
by
a
colored
servant
to
a
sleeping
room
in
the
back
part
of
the
hotel
on
the
ground
floor
i
laid
down
to
rest
thinking
of
home
and
wife
and
children
and
the
long
distance
that
stretched
between
us
until
i
fell
asleep
but
no
good
angel
of
pity
came
to
my
bedside
bidding
me
to
fly
no
voice
of
mercy
forewarned
me
in
my
dreams
of
the
trials
that
were
just
at
hand
the
next
day
there
was
a
great
pageant
in
washington
the
roar
of
cannon
and
the
tolling
of
bells
filled
the
air
while
many
houses
were
shrouded
with
crape
and
the
streets
were
black
with
people
as
the
day
advanced
the
procession
made
its
appearance
coming
slowly
through
the
avenue
carriage
after
carriage
in
long
succession
while
thousands
upon
thousands
followed
on
foot
all
moving
to
the
sound
of
melancholy
music
they
were
bearing
the
dead
body
of
harrison
to
the
grave
from
early
in
the
morning
i
was
constantly
in
the
company
of
hamilton
and
brown
they
were
the
only
persons
i
knew
in
washington
we
stood
together
as
the
funeral
pomp
passed
by
i
remember
distinctly
how
the
window
glass
would
break
and
rattle
to
the
ground
after
each
report
of
the
cannon
they
were
firing
in
the
burial
ground
we
went
to
the
capitol
and
walked
a
long
time
about
the
grounds
in
the
afternoon
they
strolled
towards
the
president
house
all
the
time
keeping
me
near
to
them
and
pointing
out
various
places
of
interest
as
yet
i
had
seen
nothing
of
the
circus
in
fact
i
had
thought
of
it
but
little
if
at
all
amidst
the
excitement
of
the
day
my
friends
several
times
during
the
afternoon
entered
drinking
saloons
and
called
for
liquor
they
were
by
no
means
in
the
habit
however
so
far
as
i
knew
them
of
indulging
to
excess
on
these
occasions
after
serving
themselves
they
would
pour
out
a
glass
and
hand
it
to
me
i
did
not
become
intoxicated
as
may
be
inferred
from
what
subsequently
occurred
towards
evening
and
soon
after
partaking
of
one
of
these
potations
i
began
to
experience
most
unpleasant
sensations
i
felt
extremely
my
head
commenced
aching
a
dull
heavy
pain
inexpressibly
disagreeable
at
the
supper
table
i
was
without
appetite
the
sight
and
flavor
of
food
was
nauseous
about
dark
the
same
servant
conducted
me
to
the
room
i
had
occupied
the
previous
night
brown
and
hamilton
advised
me
to
retire
commiserating
me
kindly
and
expressing
hopes
that
i
would
be
better
in
the
morning
divesting
myself
of
coat
and
boots
merely
i
threw
myself
upon
the
bed
it
was
impossible
to
sleep
the
pain
in
my
head
continued
to
increase
until
it
became
almost
unbearable
in
a
short
time
i
became
thirsty
my
lips
were
parched
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
water
of
lakes
and
flowing
rivers
of
brooks
where
i
had
stooped
to
drink
and
of
the
dripping
bucket
rising
with
its
cool
and
overflowing
nectar
from
the
bottom
of
the
well
towards
midnight
as
near
as
i
could
judge
i
arose
unable
longer
to
bear
such
intensity
of
thirst
i
was
a
stranger
in
the
house
and
knew
nothing
of
its
apartments
there
was
no
one
up
as
i
could
observe
groping
about
at
random
i
knew
not
where
i
found
the
way
at
last
to
a
kitchen
in
the
basement
two
or
three
colored
servants
were
moving
through
it
one
of
whom
a
woman
gave
me
two
glasses
of
water
it
afforded
momentary
relief
but
by
the
time
i
had
reached
my
room
again
the
same
burning
desire
of
drink
the
same
tormenting
thirst
had
again
returned
it
was
even
more
torturing
than
before
as
was
also
the
wild
pain
in
my
head
if
such
a
thing
could
be
i
was
in
sore
distress
in
most
excruciating
agony
i
seemed
to
stand
on
the
brink
of
madness
the
memory
of
that
night
of
horrible
suffering
will
follow
me
to
the
grave
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
more
after
my
return
from
the
kitchen
i
was
conscious
of
some
one
entering
my
room
there
seemed
to
be
several
a
mingling
of
various
voices
but
how
many
or
who
they
were
i
can
not
tell
whether
brown
and
hamilton
were
among
them
is
a
mere
matter
of
conjecture
i
only
remember
with
any
degree
of
distinctness
that
i
was
told
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
a
physician
and
procure
medicine
and
that
pulling
on
my
boots
without
coat
or
hat
i
followed
them
through
a
long
or
alley
into
the
open
street
it
ran
out
at
right
angles
from
pennsylvania
avenue
on
the
opposite
side
there
was
a
light
burning
in
a
window
my
impression
is
there
were
then
three
persons
with
me
but
it
is
altogether
indefinite
and
vague
and
like
the
memory
of
a
painful
dream
going
towards
the
light
which
i
imagined
proceeded
from
a
physician
office
and
which
seemed
to
recede
as
i
advanced
is
the
last
glimmering
recollection
i
can
now
recall
from
that
moment
i
was
insensible
how
long
i
remained
in
that
condition
whether
only
that
night
or
many
days
and
nights
i
do
not
know
but
when
consciousness
returned
i
found
myself
alone
in
utter
darkness
and
in
chains
the
pain
in
my
head
had
subsided
in
a
measure
but
i
was
very
faint
and
weak
i
was
sitting
upon
a
low
bench
made
of
rough
boards
and
without
coat
or
hat
i
was
around
my
ankles
also
were
a
pair
of
heavy
fetters
one
end
of
a
chain
was
fastened
to
a
large
ring
in
the
floor
the
other
to
the
fetters
on
my
ankles
i
tried
in
vain
to
stand
upon
my
feet
waking
from
such
a
painful
trance
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
collect
my
thoughts
where
was
i
what
was
the
meaning
of
these
chains
where
were
brown
and
hamilton
what
had
i
done
to
deserve
imprisonment
in
such
a
dungeon
i
could
not
comprehend
there
was
a
blank
of
some
indefinite
period
preceding
my
awakening
in
that
lonely
place
the
events
of
which
the
utmost
stretch
of
memory
was
unable
to
recall
i
listened
intently
for
some
sign
or
sound
of
life
but
nothing
broke
the
oppressive
silence
save
the
clinking
of
my
chains
whenever
i
chanced
to
move
i
spoke
aloud
but
the
sound
of
my
voice
startled
me
i
felt
of
my
pockets
so
far
as
the
fetters
would
allow
far
enough
indeed
to
ascertain
that
i
had
not
only
been
robbed
of
liberty
but
that
my
money
and
free
papers
were
also
gone
then
did
the
idea
begin
to
break
upon
my
mind
at
first
dim
and
confused
that
i
had
been
kidnapped
but
that
i
thought
was
incredible
there
must
have
been
some
misapprehension
some
unfortunate
mistake
it
could
not
be
that
a
free
citizen
of
who
had
wronged
no
man
nor
violated
any
law
should
be
dealt
with
thus
inhumanly
the
more
i
contemplated
my
situation
however
the
more
i
became
confirmed
in
my
suspicions
it
was
a
desolate
thought
indeed
i
felt
there
was
no
trust
or
mercy
in
unfeeling
man
and
commending
myself
to
the
god
of
the
oppressed
bowed
my
head
upon
my
fettered
hands
and
wept
most
bitterly

the
streets
came
to
my
ears
and
i
knew
that
it
was
day
no
ray
of
light
however
penetrated
my
prison
finally
i
heard
footsteps
immediately
overhead
as
of
some
one
walking
to
and
fro
it
occurred
to
me
then
that
i
must
be
in
an
underground
apartment
and
the
damp
mouldy
odors
of
the
place
confirmed
the
supposition
the
noise
above
continued
for
at
least
an
hour
when
at
last
i
heard
footsteps
approaching
from
without
a
key
rattled
in
the
lock
a
strong
door
swung
back
upon
its
hinges
admitting
a
flood
of
light
and
two
men
entered
and
stood
before
me
one
of
them
was
a
large
powerful
man
forty
years
of
age
perhaps
with
dark
hair
slightly
interspersed
with
gray
his
face
was
full
his
complexion
flush
his
features
grossly
coarse
expressive
of
nothing
but
cruelty
and
cunning
he
was
about
five
feet
ten
inches
high
of
full
habit
and
without
prejudice
i
must
be
allowed
to
say
was
a
man
whose
whole
appearance
was
sinister
and
repugnant
his
name
was
james
burch
as
i
learned
afterwards
a
in
washington
and
then
or
lately
connected
in
business
as
a
partner
with
theophilus
freeman
of
the
person
who
accompanied
him
was
a
simple
lackey
named
ebenezer
radburn
who
acted
merely
in
the
capacity
of
turnkey
both
of
these
men
still
live
in
washington
or
did
at
the
time
of
my
return
through
that
city
from
slavery
in
january
last
the
light
admitted
through
the
open
door
enabled
me
to
observe
the
room
in
which
i
was
confined
it
was
about
twelve
feet
square
the
walls
of
solid
masonry
the
floor
was
of
heavy
plank
there
was
one
small
window
crossed
with
great
iron
bars
with
an
outside
shutter
securely
fastened
an
door
led
into
an
adjoining
cell
or
vault
wholly
destitute
of
windows
or
any
means
of
admitting
light
the
furniture
of
the
room
in
which
i
was
consisted
of
the
wooden
bench
on
which
i
sat
an
dirty
box
stove
and
besides
these
in
either
cell
there
was
neither
bed
nor
blanket
nor
any
other
thing
whatever
the
door
through
which
burch
and
radburn
entered
led
through
a
small
passage
up
a
flight
of
steps
into
a
yard
surrounded
by
a
brick
wall
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
immediately
in
rear
of
a
building
of
the
same
width
as
itself
the
yard
extended
rearward
from
the
house
about
thirty
feet
in
one
part
of
the
wall
there
was
a
strongly
ironed
door
opening
into
a
narrow
covered
passage
leading
along
one
side
of
the
house
into
the
street
the
doom
of
the
colored
man
upon
whom
the
door
leading
out
of
that
narrow
passage
closed
was
sealed
the
top
of
the
wall
supported
one
end
of
a
roof
which
ascended
inwards
forming
a
kind
of
open
shed
underneath
the
roof
there
was
a
crazy
loft
all
round
where
slaves
if
so
disposed
might
sleep
at
night
or
in
inclement
weather
seek
shelter
from
the
storm
it
was
like
a
farmer
barnyard
in
most
respects
save
it
was
so
constructed
that
the
outside
world
could
never
see
the
human
cattle
that
were
herded
there
the
building
to
which
the
yard
was
attached
was
two
stories
high
fronting
on
one
of
the
public
streets
of
washington
its
outside
presented
only
the
appearance
of
a
quiet
private
residence
a
stranger
looking
at
it
would
never
have
dreamed
of
its
execrable
uses
strange
as
it
may
seem
within
plain
sight
of
this
same
house
looking
down
from
its
commanding
height
upon
it
was
the
capitol
the
voices
of
patriotic
representatives
boasting
of
freedom
and
equality
and
the
rattling
of
the
poor
slave
chains
almost
commingled
a
slave
pen
within
the
very
shadow
of
the
capitol
such
is
a
correct
description
as
it
was
in
of
williams
slave
pen
in
washington
in
one
of
the
cellars
of
which
i
found
myself
so
unaccountably
confined
well
my
boy
how
do
you
feel
now
said
burch
as
he
entered
through
the
open
door
i
replied
that
i
was
sick
and
inquired
the
cause
of
my
imprisonment
he
answered
that
i
was
his
slave
that
he
had
bought
me
and
that
he
was
about
to
send
me
to
i
asserted
aloud
and
boldly
that
i
was
a
free
man
a
resident
of
saratoga
where
i
had
a
wife
and
children
who
were
also
free
and
that
my
name
was
northup
i
complained
bitterly
of
the
strange
treatment
i
had
received
and
threatened
upon
my
liberation
to
have
satisfaction
for
the
wrong
he
denied
that
i
was
free
and
with
an
emphatic
oath
declared
that
i
came
from
georgia
again
and
again
i
asserted
i
was
no
man
slave
and
insisted
upon
his
taking
off
my
chains
at
once
he
endeavored
to
hush
me
as
if
he
feared
my
voice
would
be
overheard
but
i
would
not
be
silent
and
denounced
the
authors
of
my
imprisonment
whoever
they
might
be
as
unmitigated
villains
finding
he
could
not
quiet
me
he
flew
into
a
towering
passion
with
blasphemous
oaths
he
called
me
a
black
liar
a
runaway
from
georgia
and
every
other
profane
and
vulgar
epithet
that
the
most
indecent
fancy
could
conceive
during
this
time
radburn
was
standing
silently
by
his
business
was
to
oversee
this
human
or
rather
inhuman
stable
receiving
slaves
feeding
and
whipping
them
at
the
rate
of
two
shillings
a
head
per
day
turning
to
him
burch
ordered
the
paddle
and
to
be
brought
in
he
disappeared
and
in
a
few
moments
returned
with
these
instruments
of
torture
the
paddle
as
it
is
termed
in
parlance
or
at
least
the
one
with
which
i
first
became
acquainted
and
of
which
i
now
speak
was
a
piece
of
board
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
long
moulded
to
the
shape
of
an
pudding
stick
or
ordinary
oar
the
flattened
portion
which
was
about
the
size
in
circumference
of
two
open
hands
was
bored
with
a
small
auger
in
numerous
places
the
cat
was
a
large
rope
of
many
strands
the
strands
unraveled
and
a
knot
tied
at
the
extremity
of
each
as
soon
as
these
formidable
whips
appeared
i
was
seized
by
both
of
them
and
roughly
divested
of
my
clothing
my
feet
as
has
been
stated
were
fastened
to
the
floor
drawing
me
over
the
bench
face
downwards
radburn
placed
his
heavy
foot
upon
the
fetters
between
my
wrists
holding
them
painfully
to
the
floor
with
the
paddle
burch
commenced
beating
me
blow
after
blow
was
inflicted
upon
my
naked
body
when
his
unrelenting
arm
grew
tired
he
stopped
and
asked
if
i
still
insisted
i
was
a
free
man
i
did
insist
upon
it
and
then
the
blows
were
renewed
faster
and
more
energetically
if
possible
than
before
when
again
tired
he
would
repeat
the
same
question
and
receiving
the
same
answer
continue
his
cruel
labor
all
this
time
the
incarnate
devil
was
uttering
most
fiendish
oaths
at
length
the
paddle
broke
leaving
the
useless
handle
in
his
hand
still
i
would
not
yield
all
his
brutal
blows
could
not
force
from
my
lips
the
foul
lie
that
i
was
a
slave
casting
madly
on
the
floor
the
handle
of
the
broken
paddle
he
seized
the
rope
this
was
far
more
painful
than
the
other
i
struggled
with
all
my
power
but
it
was
in
vain
i
prayed
for
mercy
but
my
prayer
was
only
answered
with
imprecations
and
with
stripes
i
thought
i
must
die
beneath
the
lashes
of
the
accursed
brute
even
now
the
flesh
crawls
upon
my
bones
as
i
recall
the
scene
i
was
all
on
fire
my
sufferings
i
can
compare
to
nothing
else
than
the
burning
agonies
of
hell
illustration
scene
in
the
slave
pen
at
washington
at
last
i
became
silent
to
his
repeated
questions
i
would
make
no
reply
in
fact
i
was
becoming
almost
unable
to
speak
still
he
plied
the
lash
without
stint
upon
my
poor
body
until
it
seemed
that
the
lacerated
flesh
was
stripped
from
my
bones
at
every
stroke
a
man
with
a
particle
of
mercy
in
his
soul
would
not
have
beaten
even
a
dog
so
cruelly
at
length
radburn
said
that
it
was
useless
to
whip
me
any
more
that
i
would
be
sore
enough
thereupon
burch
desisted
saying
with
an
admonitory
shake
of
his
fist
in
my
face
and
hissing
the
words
through
his
teeth
that
if
ever
i
dared
to
utter
again
that
i
was
entitled
to
my
freedom
that
i
had
been
kidnapped
or
any
thing
whatever
of
the
kind
the
castigation
i
had
just
received
was
nothing
in
comparison
with
what
would
follow
he
swore
that
he
would
either
conquer
or
kill
me
with
these
consolatory
words
the
fetters
were
taken
from
my
wrists
my
feet
still
remaining
fastened
to
the
ring
the
shutter
of
the
little
barred
window
which
had
been
opened
was
again
closed
and
going
out
locking
the
great
door
behind
them
i
was
left
in
darkness
as
before
in
an
hour
perhaps
two
my
heart
leaped
to
my
throat
as
the
key
rattled
in
the
door
again
i
who
had
been
so
lonely
and
who
had
longed
so
ardently
to
see
some
one
i
cared
not
who
now
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
man
approach
a
human
face
was
fearful
to
me
especially
a
white
one
radburn
entered
bringing
with
him
on
a
tin
plate
a
piece
of
shriveled
fried
pork
a
slice
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
he
asked
me
how
i
felt
and
remarked
that
i
had
received
a
pretty
severe
flogging
he
remonstrated
with
me
against
the
propriety
of
asserting
my
freedom
in
rather
a
patronizing
and
confidential
manner
he
gave
it
to
me
as
his
advice
that
the
less
i
said
on
that
subject
the
better
it
would
be
for
me
the
man
evidently
endeavored
to
appear
kind
whether
touched
at
the
sight
of
my
sad
condition
or
with
the
view
of
silencing
on
my
part
any
further
expression
of
my
rights
it
is
not
necessary
now
to
conjecture
he
unlocked
the
fetters
from
my
ankles
opened
the
shutters
of
the
little
window
and
departed
leaving
me
again
alone
by
this
time
i
had
become
stiff
and
sore
my
body
was
covered
with
blisters
and
it
was
with
great
pain
and
difficulty
that
i
could
move
from
the
window
i
could
observe
nothing
but
the
roof
resting
on
the
adjacent
wall
at
night
i
laid
down
upon
the
damp
hard
floor
without
any
pillow
or
covering
whatever
punctually
twice
a
day
radburn
came
in
with
his
pork
and
bread
and
water
i
had
but
little
appetite
though
i
was
tormented
with
continual
thirst
my
wounds
would
not
permit
me
to
remain
but
a
few
minutes
in
any
one
position
so
sitting
or
standing
or
moving
slowly
round
i
passed
the
days
and
nights
i
was
heart
sick
and
discouraged
thoughts
of
my
family
of
my
wife
and
children
continually
occupied
my
mind
when
sleep
overpowered
me
i
dreamed
of
them
dreamed
i
was
again
in
saratoga
that
i
could
see
their
faces
and
hear
their
voices
calling
me
awakening
from
the
pleasant
phantasms
of
sleep
to
the
bitter
realities
around
me
i
could
but
groan
and
weep
still
my
spirit
was
not
broken
i
indulged
the
anticipation
of
escape
and
that
speedily
it
was
impossible
i
reasoned
that
men
could
be
so
unjust
as
to
detain
me
as
a
slave
when
the
truth
of
my
case
was
known
burch
ascertaining
i
was
no
runaway
from
georgia
would
certainly
let
me
go
though
suspicions
of
brown
and
hamilton
were
not
unfrequent
i
could
not
reconcile
myself
to
the
idea
that
they
were
instrumental
to
my
imprisonment
surely
they
would
seek
me
out
they
would
deliver
me
from
thraldom
alas
i
had
not
then
learned
the
measure
of
inhumanity
to
man
nor
to
what
limitless
extent
of
wickedness
he
will
go
for
the
love
of
gain
in
the
course
of
several
days
the
outer
door
was
thrown
open
allowing
me
the
liberty
of
the
yard
there
i
found
three
slaves
one
of
them
a
lad
of
ten
years
the
others
young
men
of
about
twenty
and
i
was
not
long
in
forming
an
acquaintance
and
learning
their
names
and
the
particulars
of
their
history
the
eldest
was
a
colored
man
named
clemens
ray
he
had
lived
in
washington
had
driven
a
hack
and
worked
in
a
livery
stable
there
for
a
long
time
he
was
very
intelligent
and
fully
comprehended
his
situation
the
thought
of
going
south
overwhelmed
him
with
grief
burch
had
purchased
him
a
few
days
before
and
had
placed
him
there
until
such
time
as
he
was
ready
to
send
him
to
the
market
from
him
i
learned
for
the
first
time
that
i
was
in
william
slave
pen
a
place
i
had
never
heard
of
previously
he
described
to
me
the
uses
for
which
it
was
designed
i
repeated
to
him
the
particulars
of
my
unhappy
story
but
he
could
only
give
me
the
consolation
of
his
sympathy
he
also
advised
me
to
be
silent
henceforth
on
the
subject
of
my
freedom
for
knowing
the
character
of
burch
he
assured
me
that
it
would
only
be
attended
with
renewed
whipping
the
next
eldest
was
named
john
williams
he
was
raised
in
virginia
not
far
from
washington
burch
had
taken
him
in
payment
of
a
debt
and
he
constantly
entertained
the
hope
that
his
master
would
redeem
him
a
hope
that
was
subsequently
realized
the
lad
was
a
sprightly
child
that
answered
to
the
name
of
randall
most
of
the
time
he
was
playing
about
the
yard
but
occasionally
would
cry
calling
for
his
mother
and
wondering
when
she
would
come
his
mother
absence
seemed
to
be
the
great
and
only
grief
in
his
little
heart
he
was
too
young
to
realize
his
condition
and
when
the
memory
of
his
mother
was
not
in
his
mind
he
amused
us
with
his
pleasant
pranks
at
night
ray
williams
and
the
boy
slept
in
the
loft
of
the
shed
while
i
was
locked
in
the
cell
finally
we
were
each
provided
with
blankets
such
as
are
used
upon
horses
the
only
bedding
i
was
allowed
to
have
for
twelve
years
afterwards
ray
and
williams
asked
me
many
questions
about
how
colored
people
were
treated
there
how
they
could
have
homes
and
families
of
their
own
with
none
to
disturb
and
oppress
them
and
ray
especially
sighed
continually
for
freedom
such
conversations
however
were
not
in
the
hearing
of
burch
or
the
keeper
radburn
aspirations
such
as
these
would
have
brought
down
the
lash
upon
our
backs
it
is
necessary
in
this
narrative
in
order
to
present
a
full
and
truthful
statement
of
all
the
principal
events
in
the
history
of
my
life
and
to
portray
the
institution
of
slavery
as
i
have
seen
and
known
it
to
speak
of
places
and
of
many
persons
who
are
yet
living
i
am
and
always
was
an
entire
stranger
in
washington
and
its
vicinity
aside
from
burch
and
radburn
knowing
no
man
there
except
as
i
have
heard
of
them
through
my
enslaved
companions
what
i
am
about
to
say
if
false
can
be
easily
contradicted
i
remained
in
williams
slave
pen
about
two
weeks
the
night
previous
to
my
departure
a
woman
was
brought
in
weeping
bitterly
and
leading
by
the
hand
a
little
child
they
were
randall
mother
and
on
meeting
them
he
was
overjoyed
clinging
to
her
dress
kissing
the
child
and
exhibiting
every
demonstration
of
delight
the
mother
also
clasped
him
in
her
arms
embraced
him
tenderly
and
gazed
at
him
fondly
through
her
tears
calling
him
by
many
an
endearing
name
emily
the
child
was
seven
or
eight
years
old
of
light
complexion
and
with
a
face
of
admirable
beauty
her
hair
fell
in
curls
around
her
neck
while
the
style
and
richness
of
her
dress
and
the
neatness
of
her
whole
appearance
indicated
she
had
been
brought
up
in
the
midst
of
wealth
she
was
a
sweet
child
indeed
the
woman
also
was
arrayed
in
silk
with
rings
upon
her
fingers
and
golden
ornaments
suspended
from
her
ears
her
air
and
manners
the
correctness
and
propriety
of
her
language
all
showed
evidently
that
she
had
sometime
stood
above
the
common
level
of
a
slave
she
seemed
to
be
amazed
at
finding
herself
in
such
a
place
as
that
it
was
plainly
a
sudden
and
unexpected
turn
of
fortune
that
had
brought
her
there
filling
the
air
with
her
complainings
she
was
hustled
with
the
children
and
myself
into
the
cell
language
can
convey
but
an
inadequate
impression
of
the
lamentations
to
which
she
gave
incessant
utterance
throwing
herself
upon
the
floor
and
encircling
the
children
in
her
arms
she
poured
forth
such
touching
words
as
only
maternal
love
and
kindness
can
suggest
they
nestled
closely
to
her
as
if
only
was
there
any
safety
or
protection
at
last
they
slept
their
heads
resting
upon
her
lap
while
they
slumbered
she
smoothed
the
hair
back
from
their
little
foreheads
and
talked
to
them
all
night
long
she
called
them
her
darlings
her
sweet
babes
poor
innocent
things
that
knew
not
the
misery
they
were
destined
to
endure
soon
they
would
have
no
mother
to
comfort
them
they
would
be
taken
from
her
what
would
become
of
them
oh
she
could
not
live
away
from
her
little
emmy
and
her
dear
boy
they
had
always
been
good
children
and
had
such
loving
ways
it
would
break
her
heart
god
knew
she
said
if
they
were
taken
from
her
and
yet
she
knew
they
meant
to
sell
them
and
may
be
they
would
be
separated
and
could
never
see
each
other
any
more
it
was
enough
to
melt
a
heart
of
stone
to
listen
to
the
pitiful
expressions
of
that
desolate
and
distracted
mother
her
name
was
eliza
and
this
was
the
story
of
her
life
as
she
afterwards
related
it
she
was
the
slave
of
elisha
berry
a
rich
man
living
in
the
neighborhood
of
washington
she
was
born
i
think
she
said
on
his
plantation
years
before
he
had
fallen
into
dissipated
habits
and
quarreled
with
his
wife
in
fact
soon
after
the
birth
of
randall
they
separated
leaving
his
wife
and
daughter
in
the
house
they
had
always
occupied
he
erected
a
new
one
near
by
on
the
estate
into
this
house
he
brought
eliza
and
on
condition
of
her
living
with
him
she
and
her
children
were
to
be
emancipated
she
resided
with
him
there
nine
years
with
servants
to
attend
upon
her
and
provided
with
every
comfort
and
luxury
of
life
emily
was
his
child
finally
her
young
mistress
who
had
always
remained
with
her
mother
at
the
homestead
married
a
jacob
brooks
at
length
for
some
cause
as
i
gathered
from
her
relation
beyond
berry
control
a
division
of
his
property
was
made
she
and
her
children
fell
to
the
share
of
brooks
during
the
nine
years
she
had
lived
with
berry
in
consequence
of
the
position
she
was
compelled
to
occupy
she
and
emily
had
become
the
object
of
berry
and
her
daughter
hatred
and
dislike
berry
himself
she
represented
as
a
man
of
naturally
a
kind
heart
who
always
promised
her
that
she
should
have
her
freedom
and
who
she
had
no
doubt
would
grant
it
to
her
then
if
it
were
only
in
his
power
as
soon
as
they
thus
came
into
the
possession
and
control
of
the
daughter
it
became
very
manifest
they
would
not
live
long
together
the
sight
of
eliza
seemed
to
be
odious
to
brooks
neither
could
she
bear
to
look
upon
the
child
and
beautiful
as
she
was
the
day
she
was
led
into
the
pen
brooks
had
brought
her
from
the
estate
into
the
city
under
pretence
that
the
time
had
come
when
her
free
papers
were
to
be
executed
in
fulfillment
of
her
promise
elated
at
the
prospect
of
immediate
liberty
she
decked
herself
and
little
emmy
in
their
best
apparel
and
accompanied
him
with
a
joyful
heart
on
their
arrival
in
the
city
instead
of
being
baptized
into
the
family
of
freemen
she
was
delivered
to
the
trader
burch
the
paper
that
was
executed
was
a
bill
of
sale
the
hope
of
years
was
blasted
in
a
moment
from
the
height
of
most
exulting
happiness
to
the
utmost
depths
of
wretchedness
she
had
that
day
descended
no
wonder
that
she
wept
and
filled
the
pen
with
wailings
and
expressions
of
woe
eliza
is
now
dead
far
up
the
red
river
where
it
pours
its
waters
sluggishly
through
the
unhealthy
low
lands
of
louisiana
she
rests
in
the
grave
at
last
the
only
resting
place
of
the
poor
slave
how
all
her
fears
were
realized
how
she
mourned
day
and
night
and
never
would
be
comforted
how
as
she
predicted
her
heart
did
indeed
break
with
the
burden
of
maternal
sorrow

be
seen

during

she
complained
bitterly
of

her
young
husband
she
declared
that
had
she
been
aware
of
the
deception
he
intended
to
practice
upon
her
he
never
would
have
brought
her
there
alive
they
had
chosen
the
opportunity
of
getting
her
away
when
master
berry
was
absent
from
the
plantation
he
had
always
been
kind
to
her
she
wished
that
she
could
see
him
but
she
knew
that
even
he
was
unable
now
to
rescue
her
then
would
she
commence
weeping
again
kissing
the
sleeping
children
talking
first
to
one
then
to
the
other
as
they
lay
in
their
unconscious
slumbers
with
their
heads
upon
her
lap
so
wore
the
long
night
away
and
when
the
morning
dawned
and
night
had
come
again
still
she
kept
mourning
on
and
would
not
be
consoled
about
midnight
following
the
cell
door
opened
and
burch
and
radburn
entered
with
lanterns
in
their
hands
burch
with
an
oath
ordered
us
to
roll
up
our
blankets
without
delay
and
get
ready
to
go
on
board
the
boat
he
swore
we
would
be
left
unless
we
hurried
fast
he
aroused
the
children
from
their
slumbers
with
a
rough
shake
and
said
they
were
d
d
sleepy
it
appeared
going
out
into
the
yard
he
called
clem
ray
ordering
him
to
leave
the
loft
and
come
into
the
cell
and
bring
his
blanket
with
him
when
clem
appeared
he
placed
us
side
by
side
and
fastened
us
together
with
my
left
hand

his
right

williams

taken

before

to
his
delight
clem
and
i
were
ordered
to
march
eliza
and
the
children
following
we
were
conducted
into
the
yard
from
thence
into
the
covered
passage
and
up
a
flight
of
steps
through
a
side
door
into
the
upper
room
where
i
had
heard
the
walking
to
and
fro
its
furniture
was
a
stove
a
few
old
chairs
and
a
long
table
covered
with
papers
it
was
a
room
without
any
carpet
on
the
floor
and
seemed
a
sort
of
office
by
one
of
the
windows
i
remember
hung
a
rusty
sword
which
attracted
my
attention
burch
trunk
was
there
in
obedience
to
his
orders
i
took
hold
of
one
of
its
handles
with
my
unfettered
hand
while
he
taking
hold
of
the
other
we
proceeded
out
of
the
front
door
into
the
street
in
the
same
order
as
we
had
left
the
cell
it
was
a
dark
night
all
was
quiet
i
could
see
lights
or
the
reflection
of
them
over
towards
pennsylvania
avenue
but
there
was
no
one
not
even
a
straggler
to
be
seen
i
was
almost
resolved
to
attempt
to
break
away
had
i
not
been
the
attempt
would
certainly
have
been
made
whatever
consequence
might
have
followed
radburn
was
in
the
rear
carrying
a
large
stick
and
hurrying
up
the
children
as
fast
as
the
little
ones
could
walk
so
we
passed
and
in
silence
through
the
streets
of
washington
through
the
capital
of
a
nation
whose
theory
of
government
we
are
told
rests
on
the
foundation
of
man
inalienable
right
to
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
hail
columbia
happy
land
indeed
reaching
the
steamboat
we
were
quickly
hustled
into
the
hold
among
barrels
and
boxes
of
freight
a
colored
servant
brought
a
light
the
bell
rung
and
soon
the
vessel
started
down
the
potomac
carrying
us
we
knew
not
where
the
bell
tolled
as
we
passed
the
tomb
of
washington
burch
no
doubt
with
uncovered
head
bowed
reverently
before
the
sacred
ashes
of
the
man
who
devoted
his
illustrious
life
to
the
liberty
of
his
country
none
of
us
slept
that
night
but
randall
and
little
emmy
for
the
first
time
clem
ray
was
wholly
overcome
to
him
the
idea
of
going
south
was
terrible
in
the
extreme
he
was
leaving
the
friends
and
associations
of
his
youth
every
thing
that
was
dear
and
precious
to
his
heart
in
all
probability
never
to
return
he
and
eliza
mingled
their
tears
together
bemoaning
their
cruel
fate
for
my
own
part
difficult
as
it
was
i
endeavored
to
keep
up
my
spirits
i
resolved
in
my
mind
a
hundred
plans
of
escape
and
fully
determined
to
make
the
attempt
the
first
desperate
chance
that
offered
i
had
by
this
time
become
satisfied
however
that
my
true
policy
was
to
say
nothing
further
on
the
subject
of
my
having
been
born
a
freeman
it
would
but
expose
me
to
and
diminish
the
chances
of
liberation
after
sunrise
in
the
morning
we
were
called
up
on
deck
to
breakfast
burch
took
our
off
and
we
sat
down
to
table
he
asked
eliza
if
she
would
take
a
dram
she
declined
thanking
him
politely
during
the
meal
we
were
all
silent
not
a
word
passed
between
us
a
mulatto
woman
who
served
at
table
seemed
to
take
an
interest
in
our
behalf
told
us
to
cheer
up
and
not
to
be
so
cast
down
breakfast
over
the
were
restored
and
burch
ordered
us
out
on
the
stern
deck
we
sat
down
together
on
some
boxes
still
saying
nothing
in
burch
presence
occasionally
a
passenger
would
walk
out
to
where
we
were
look
at
us
for
a
while
then
silently
return
it
was
a
very
pleasant
morning
the
fields
along
the
river
were
covered
with
verdure
far
in
advance
of
what
i
had
been
accustomed
to
see
at
that
season
of
the
year
the
sun
shone
out
warmly
the
birds
were
singing
in
the
trees
the
happy
birds
i
envied
them
i
wished
for
wings
like
them
that
i
might
cleave
the
air
to
where
my
birdlings
waited
vainly
for
their
father
coming
in
the
cooler
region
of
the
north
in
the
forenoon
the
steamer
reached
aquia
creek
there
the
passengers
took
stages
burch
and
his
five
slaves
occupying
one
exclusively
he
laughed
with
the
children
and
at
one
stopping
place
went
so
far
as
to
purchase
them
a
piece
of
gingerbread
he
told
me
to
hold
up
my
head
and
look
smart
that
i
might
perhaps
get
a
good
master
if
i
behaved
myself
i
made
him
no
reply
his
face
was
hateful
to
me
and
i
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
it
i
sat
in
the
corner
cherishing
in
my
heart
the
hope
not
yet
extinct
of
some
day
meeting
the
tyrant
on
the
soil
of
my
native
state
at
fredericksburgh
we
were
transferred
from
the
stage
coach
to
a
car
and
before
dark
arrived
in
richmond
the
chief
city
of
virginia
at
this
city
we
were
taken
from
the
cars
and
driven
through
the
street
to
a
slave
pen
between
the
railroad
depot
and
the
river
kept
by
a
goodin
this
pen
is
similar
to
williams
in
washington
except
it
is
somewhat
larger
and
besides
there
were
two
small
houses
standing
at
opposite
corners
within
the
yard
these
houses
are
usually
found
within
slave
yards
being
used
as
rooms
for
the
examination
of
human
chattels
by
purchasers
before
concluding
a
bargain
unsoundness
in
a
slave
as
well
as
in
a
horse
detracts
materially
from
his
value
if
no
warranty
is
given
a
close
examination
is
a
matter
of
particular
importance
to
the
negro
jockey
we
were
met
at
the
door
of
goodin
yard
by
that
gentleman
himself
a
short
fat
man
with
a
round
plump
face
black
hair
and
whiskers
and
a
complexion
almost
as
dark
as
some
of
his
own
negroes
he
had
a
hard
stern
look
and
was
perhaps
about
fifty
years
of
age
burch
and
he
met
with
great
cordiality
they
were
evidently
old
friends
shaking
each
other
warmly
by
the
hand
burch
remarked
he
had
brought
some
company
inquired
at
what
time
the
brig
would
leave
and
was
answered
that
it
would
probably
leave
the
next
day
at
such
an
hour
goodin
then
turned
to
me
took
hold
of
my
arm
turned
me
partly
round
looked
at
me
sharply
with
the
air
of
one
who
considered
himself
a
good
judge
of
property
and
as
if
estimating
in
his
own
mind
about
how
much
i
was
worth
well
boy
where
did
you
come
from
forgetting
myself
for
a
moment
i
answered
from
h
l
what
have
you
been
doing
up
there
was
his
astonished
interrogatory
observing
burch
at
this
moment
looking
at
me
with
an
angry
expression
that
conveyed
a
meaning
it
was
not
difficult
to
understand
i
immediately
said
o
i
have
only
been
up
that
way
a
piece
in
a
manner
intended
to
imply
that
although
i
might
have
been
as
far
as
yet
i
wished
it
distinctly
understood
that
i
did
not
belong
to
that
free
state
nor
to
any
other
goodin
then
turned
to
clem
and
then
to
eliza
and
the
children
examining
them
severally
and
asking
various
questions
he
was
pleased
with
emily
as
was
every
one
who
saw
the
child
sweet
countenance
she
was
not
as
tidy
as
when
i
first
beheld
her
her
hair
was
now
somewhat
disheveled
but
through
its
unkempt
and
soft
profusion
there
still
beamed
a
little
face
of
most
surpassing
loveliness
altogether
we
were
a
fair
lot
a
devilish
good
lot
he
said
enforcing
that
opinion
with
more
than
one
emphatic
adjective
not
found
in
the
christian
vocabulary
thereupon
we
passed
into
the
yard
quite
a
number
of
slaves
as
many
as
thirty
i
should
say
were
moving
about
or
sitting
on
benches
under
the
shed
they
were
all
cleanly
dressed
the
men
with
hats
the
women
with
handkerchiefs
tied
about
their
heads
burch
and
goodin
after
separating
from
us
walked
up
the
steps
at
the
back
part
of
the
main
building
and
sat
down
upon
the
door
sill
they
entered
into
conversation
but
the
subject
of
it
i
could
not
hear
presently
burch
came
down
into
the
yard
unfettered
me
and
led
me
into
one
of
the
small
houses
you
told
that
man
you
came
from
said
he
i
replied
i
told
him
i
had
been
up
as
far
as
to
be
sure
but
did
not
tell
him
i
belonged
there
nor
that
i
was
a
freeman
i
meant
no
harm
at
all
master
burch
i
would
not
have
said
it
had
i
thought
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
as
if
he
was
ready
to
devour
me
then
turning
round
went
out
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
if
ever
i
hear
you
say
a
word
about
or
about
your
freedom
i
will
be
the
death
of
you
i
will
kill
you
you
may
rely
on
that
he
ejaculated
fiercely
i
doubt
not
he
understood
then
better
than
i
did
the
danger
and
the
penalty
of
selling
a
free
man
into
slavery
he
felt
the
necessity
of
closing
my
mouth
against
the
crime
he
knew
he
was
committing
of
course
my
life
would
not
have
weighed
a
feather
in
any
emergency
requiring
such
a
sacrifice
undoubtedly
he
meant
precisely
what
he
said
under
the
shed
on
one
side
of
the
yard
there
was
constructed
a
rough
table
while
overhead
were
sleeping
lofts
the
same
as
in
the
pen
at
washington
after
partaking
at
this
table
of
our
supper
of
pork
and
bread
i
was
to
a
large
yellow
man
quite
stout
and
fleshy
with
a
countenance
expressive
of
the
utmost
melancholy
he
was
a
man
of
intelligence
and
information
chained
together
it
was
not
long
before
we
became
acquainted
with
each
other
history
his
name
was
robert
like
myself
he
had
been
born
free
and
had
a
wife
and
two
children
in
cincinnati
he
said
he
had
come
south
with
two
men
who
had
hired
him
in
the
city
of
his
residence
without
free
papers
he
had
been
seized
at
fredericksburgh
placed
in
confinement
and
beaten
until
he
had
learned
as
i
had
the
necessity
and
the
policy
of
silence
he
had
been
in
goodin
pen
about
three
weeks
to
this
man
i
became
much
attached
we
could
sympathize
with
and
understand
each
other
it
was
with
tears
and
a
heavy
heart
not
many
days
subsequently
that
i
saw
him
die
and
looked
for
the
last
time
upon
his
lifeless
form
robert
and
myself
with
clem
eliza
and
her
children
slept
that
night
upon
our
blankets
in
one
of
the
small
houses
in
the
yard
there
were
four
others
all
from
the
same
plantation
who
had
been
sold
and
were
now
on
their
way
south
who
also
occupied
it
with
us
david
and
his
wife
caroline
both
mulattoes
were
exceedingly
affected
they
dreaded
the
thought
of
being
put
into
the
cane
and
cotton
fields
but
their
greatest
source
of
anxiety
was
the
apprehension
of
being
separated
mary
a
tall
lithe
girl
of
a
most
jetty
black
was
listless
and
apparently
indifferent
like
many
of
the
class
she
scarcely
knew
there
was
such
a
word
as
freedom
brought
up
in
the
ignorance
of
a
brute
she
possessed
but
little
more
than
a
intelligence
she
was
one
of
those
and
there
are
very
many
who
fear
nothing
but
their
master
lash
and
know
no
further
duty
than
to
obey
his
voice
the
other
was
lethe
she
was
of
an
entirely
different
character
she
had
long
straight
hair
and
bore
more
the
appearance
of
an
indian
than
a
negro
woman
she
had
sharp
and
spiteful
eyes
and
continually
gave
utterance
to
the
language
of
hatred
and
revenge
her
husband
had
been
sold
she
knew
not
where
she
was
an
exchange
of
masters
she
was
sure
could
not
be
for
the
worse
she
cared
not
whither
they
might
carry
her
pointing
to
the
scars
upon
her
face
the
desperate
creature
wished
that
she
might
see
the
day
when
she
could
wipe
them
off
in
some
man
blood
while
we
were
thus
learning
the
history
of
each
other
wretchedness
eliza
was
seated
in
a
corner
by
herself
singing
hymns
and
praying
for
her
children
wearied
from
the
loss
of
so
much
sleep
i
could
no
longer
bear
up
against
the
advances
of
that
sweet
restorer
and
laying
down
by
the
side
of
robert
on
the
floor
soon
forgot
my
troubles
and
slept
until
the
dawn
of
day
in
the
morning
having
swept
the
yard
and
washed
ourselves
under
goodin
superintendence
we
were
ordered
to
roll
up
our
blankets
and
make
ready
for
the
continuance
of
our
journey
clem
ray
was
informed
that
he
would
go
no
further
burch
for
some
cause
having
concluded
to
carry
him
back
to
washington
he
was
much
rejoiced
shaking
hands
we
parted
in
the
slave
pen
at
richmond
and
i
have
not
seen
him
since
but
much
to
my
surprise
since
my
return
i
learned
that
he
had
escaped
from
bondage
and
on
his
way
to
the
free
soil
of
canada
lodged
one
night
at
the
house
of
my
in
saratoga
informing
my
family
of
the
place
and
the
condition
in
which
he
left
me
in
the
afternoon
we
were
drawn
up
two
abreast
robert
and
myself
in
advance
and
in
this
order
driven
by
burch
and
goodin
from
the
yard
through
the
streets
of
richmond
to
the
brig
orleans
she
was
a
vessel
of
respectable
size
full
rigged
and
freighted
principally
with
tobacco
we
were
all
on
board
by
five
burch
brought
us
each
a
tin
cup
and
a
spoon
there
were
forty
of
us
in
the
brig
being
all
except
clem
that
were
in
the
pen
with
a
small
pocket
knife
that
had
not
been
taken
from
me
i
began
cutting
the
initials
of
my
name
upon
the
tin
cup
the
others
immediately
flocked
round
me
requesting
me
to
mark
theirs
in
a
similar
manner
in
time
i
gratified
them
all
of
which
they
did
not
appear
to
be
forgetful
we
were
all
stowed
away
in
the
hold
at
night
and
the
hatch
barred
down
we
laid
on
boxes
or
there
was
room
enough
to
stretch
our
blankets
on
the
floor
burch
accompanied
us
no
farther
than
richmond
returning
from
that
point
to
the
capital
with
clem
not
until
the
lapse
of
almost
twelve
years
to
wit
in
january
last
in
the
washington
police
office
did
i
set
my
eyes
upon
his
face
again
james
burch
was
a
buying
men
women
and
children
at
low
prices
and
selling
them
at
an
advance
he
was
a
speculator
in
human
flesh
a
disreputable
calling
and
so
considered
at
the
south
for
the
present
he
disappears
from
the
scenes
recorded
in
this
narrative
but
he
will
appear
again
before
its
close
not
in
the
character
of
a
tyrant
but
as
an
arrested
cringing
criminal
in
a
court
of
law
that
failed
to
do
him
justice

river
passing
into
chesapeake
bay
we
arrived
next
day
opposite
the
city
of
norfolk
while
lying
at
anchor
a
lighter
approached
us
from
the
town
bringing
four
more
slaves
frederick
a
boy
of
eighteen
had
been
born
a
slave
as
also
had
henry
who
was
some
years
older
they
had
both
been
house
servants
in
the
city
maria
was
a
rather
genteel
looking
colored
girl
with
a
faultless
form
but
ignorant
and
extremely
vain
the
idea
of
going
to
was
pleasing
to
her
she
entertained
an
extravagantly
high
opinion
of
her
own
attractions
assuming
a
haughty
mien
she
declared
to
her
companions
that
immediately
on
our
arrival
in
she
had
no
doubt
some
wealthy
single
gentleman
of
good
taste
would
purchase
her
at
once
but
the
most
prominent
of
the
four
was
a
man
named
arthur
as
the
lighter
approached
he
struggled
stoutly
with
his
keepers
it
was
with
main
force
that
he
was
dragged
aboard
the
brig
he
protested
in
a
loud
voice
against
the
treatment
he
was
receiving
and
demanded
to
be
released
his
face
was
swollen
and
covered
with
wounds
and
bruises
and
indeed
one
side
of
it
was
a
complete
raw
sore
he
was
forced
with
all
haste
down
the
hatchway
into
the
hold
i
caught
an
outline
of
his
story
as
he
was
borne
struggling
along
of
which
he
afterwards
gave
me
a
more
full
relation
and
it
was
as
follows
he
had
long
resided
in
the
city
of
norfolk
and
was
a
free
man
he
had
a
family
living
there
and
was
a
mason
by
trade
having
been
unusually
detained
he
was
returning
late
one
night
to
his
house
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
when
he
was
attacked
by
a
gang
of
persons
in
an
unfrequented
street
he
fought
until
his
strength
failed
him
overpowered
at
last
he
was
gagged
and
bound
with
ropes
and
beaten
until
he
became
insensible
for
several
days
they
secreted
him
in
the
slave
pen
at
norfolk
a
very
common
establishment
it
appears
in
the
cities
of
the
south
the
night
before
he
had
been
taken
out
and
put
on
board
the
lighter
which
pushing
out
from
shore
had
awaited
our
arrival
for
some
time
he
continued
his
protestations
and
was
altogether
irreconcilable
at
length
however
he
became
silent
he
sank
into
a
gloomy
and
thoughtful
mood
and
appeared
to
be
counseling
with
himself
there
was
in
the
man
determined
face
something
that
suggested
the
thought
of
desperation
after
leaving
norfolk
the
were
taken
off
and
during
the
day
we
were
allowed
to
remain
on
deck
the
captain
selected
robert
as
his
waiter
and
i
was
appointed
to
superintend
the
cooking
department
and
the
distribution
of
food
and
water
i
had
three
assistants
jim
cuffee
and
jenny
jenny
business
was
to
prepare
the
coffee
which
consisted
of
corn
meal
scorched
in
a
kettle
boiled
and
sweetened
with
molasses
jim
and
cuffee
baked
the
and
boiled
the
bacon
standing
by
a
table
formed
of
a
wide
board
resting
on
the
heads
of
the
barrels
i
cut
and
handed
to
each
a
slice
of
meat
and
a
dodger
of
the
bread
and
from
jenny
kettle
also
dipped
out
for
each
a
cup
of
the
coffee
the
use
of
plates
was
dispensed
with
and
their
sable
fingers
took
the
place
of
knives
and
forks
jim
and
cuffee
were
very
demure
and
attentive
to
business
somewhat
inflated
with
their
situation
as
second
cooks
and
without
doubt
feeling
that
there
was
a
great
responsibility
resting
on
them
i
was
called
steward
a
name
given
me
by
the
captain
the
slaves
were
fed
twice
a
day
at
ten
and
five
always
receiving
the
same
kind
and
quantity
of
fare
and
in
the
same
manner
as
above
described
at
night
we
were
driven
into
the
hold
and
securely
fastened
down
scarcely
were
we
out
of
sight
of
land
before
we
were
overtaken
by
a
violent
storm
the
brig
rolled
and
plunged
until
we
feared
she
would
go
down
some
were
others
on
their
knees
praying
while
some
were
fast
holding
to
each
other
paralyzed
with
fear
the
rendered
the
place
of
our
confinement
loathsome
and
disgusting
it
would
have
been
a
happy
thing
for
most
of
us
it
would
have
saved
the
agony
of
many
hundred
lashes
and
miserable
deaths
at
last
had
the
compassionate
sea
snatched
us
that
day
from
the
clutches
of
remorseless
men
the
thought
of
randall
and
little
emmy
sinking
down
among
the
monsters
of
the
deep
is
a
more
pleasant
contemplation
than
to
think
of
them
as
they
are
now
perhaps
dragging
out
lives
of
unrequited
toil
when
in
sight
of
the
bahama
banks
at
a
place
called
old
point
compass
or
the
hole
in
the
wall
we
were
becalmed
three
days
there
was
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
the
waters
of
the
gulf
presented
a
singularly
white
appearance
like
lime
water
in
the
order
of
events
i
come
now
to
the
relation
of
an
occurrence
which
i
never
call
to
mind
but
with
sensations
of
regret
i
thank
god
who
has
since
permitted
me
to
escape
from
the
thralldom
of
slavery
that
through
his
merciful
interposition
i
was
prevented
from
imbruing
my
hands
in
the
blood
of
his
creatures
let
not
those
who
have
never
been
placed
in
like
circumstances
judge
me
harshly
until
they
have
been
chained
and
beaten
until
they
find
themselves
in
the
situation
i
was
borne
away
from
home
and
family
towards
a
land
of
bondage
let
them
refrain
from
saying
what
they
would
not
do
for
liberty
how
far
i
should
have
been
justified
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
it
is
unnecessary
now
to
speculate
upon
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
am
able
to
congratulate
myself
upon
the
harmless
termination
of
an
affair
which
threatened
for
a
time
to
be
attended
with
serious
results
towards
evening
on
the
first
day
of
the
calm
arthur
and
myself
were
in
the
bow
of
the
vessel
seated
on
the
windlass
we
were
conversing
together
of
the
probable
destiny
that
awaited
us
and
mourning
together
over
our
misfortunes
arthur
said
and
i
agreed
with
him
that
death
was
far
less
terrible
than
the
living
prospect
that
was
before
us
for
a
long
time
we
talked
of
our
children
our
past
lives
and
of
the
probabilities
of
escape
obtaining
possession
of
the
brig
was
suggested
by
one
of
us
we
discussed
the
possibility
of
our
being
able
in
such
an
event
to
make
our
way
to
the
harbor
of
i
knew
little
of
the
compass
but
the
idea
of
risking
the
experiment
was
eagerly
entertained
the
chances
for
and
against
us
in
an
encounter
with
the
crew
was
canvassed
who
could
be
relied
upon
and
who
could
not
the
proper
time
and
manner
of
the
attack
were
all
talked
over
and
over
again
from
the
moment
the
plot
suggested
itself
i
began
to
hope
i
revolved
it
constantly
in
my
mind
as
difficulty
after
difficulty
arose
some
ready
conceit
was
at
hand
demonstrating
how
it
could
be
overcome
while
others
slept
arthur
and
i
were
maturing
our
plans
at
length
with
much
caution
robert
was
gradually
made
acquainted
with
our
intentions
he
approved
of
them
at
once
and
entered
into
the
conspiracy
with
a
zealous
spirit
there
was
not
another
slave
we
dared
to
trust
brought
up
in
fear
and
ignorance
as
they
are
it
can
scarcely
be
conceived
how
servilely
they
will
cringe
before
a
white
man
look
it
was
not
safe
to
deposit
so
bold
a
secret
with
any
of
them
and
finally
we
three
resolved
to
take
upon
ourselves
alone
the
fearful
responsibility
of
the
attempt
at
night
as
has
been
said
we
were
driven
into
the
hold
and
the
hatch
barred
down
how
to
reach
the
deck
was
the
first
difficulty
that
presented
itself
on
the
bow
of
the
brig
however
i
had
observed
the
small
boat
lying
bottom
upwards
it
occurred
to
me
that
by
secreting
ourselves
underneath
it
we
would
not
be
missed
from
the
crowd
as
they
were
hurried
down
into
the
hold
at
night
i
was
selected
to
make
the
experiment
in
order
to
satisfy
ourselves
of
its
feasibility
the
next
evening
accordingly
after
supper
watching
my
opportunity
i
hastily
concealed
myself
beneath
it
lying
close
upon
the
deck
i
could
see
what
was
going
on
around
me
while
wholly
unperceived
myself
in
the
morning
as
they
came
up
i
slipped
from
my
hiding
place
without
being
observed
the
result
was
entirely
satisfactory
the
captain
and
mate
slept
in
the
cabin
of
the
former
from
robert
who
had
frequent
occasion
in
his
capacity
of
waiter
to
make
observations
in
that
quarter
we
ascertained
the
exact
position
of
their
respective
berths
he
further
informed
us
that
there
were
always
two
pistols
and
a
cutlass
lying
on
the
table
the
crew
cook
slept
in
the
cook
galley
on
deck
a
sort
of
vehicle
on
wheels
that
could
be
moved
about
as
convenience
required
while
the
sailors
numbering
only
six
either
slept
in
the
forecastle
or
in
hammocks
swung
among
the
rigging
finally
our
arrangements
were
all
completed
arthur
and
i
were
to
steal
silently
to
the
captain
cabin
seize
the
pistols
and
cutlass
and
as
quickly
as
possible
despatch
him
and
the
mate
robert
with
a
club
was
to
stand
by
the
door
leading
from
the
deck
down
into
the
cabin
and
in
case
of
necessity
beat
back
the
sailors
until
we
could
hurry
to
his
assistance
we
were
to
proceed
then
as
circumstances
might
require
should
the
attack
be
so
sudden
and
successful
as
to
prevent
resistance
the
hatch
was
to
remain
barred
down
otherwise
the
slaves
were
to
be
called
up
and
in
the
crowd
and
hurry
and
confusion
of
the
time
we
resolved
to
regain
our
liberty
or
lose
our
lives
i
was
then
to
assume
the
unaccustomed
place
of
pilot
and
steering
northward
we
trusted
that
some
lucky
wind
might
bear
us
to
the
soil
of
freedom
the
mate
name
was
biddee
the
captain
i
can
not
now
recall
though
i
rarely
ever
forget
a
name
once
heard
the
captain
was
a
small
genteel
man
erect
and
prompt
with
a
proud
bearing
and
looked
the
personification
of
courage
if
he
is
still
living
and
these
pages
should
chance
to
meet
his
eye
he
will
learn
a
fact
connected
with
the
voyage
of
the
brig
from
richmond
to
in
not
entered
on
his
we
were
all
prepared
and
impatiently
waiting
an
opportunity
of
putting
our
designs
into
execution
when
they
were
frustrated
by
a
sad
and
unforeseen
event
robert
was
taken
ill
it
was
soon
announced
that
he
had
the
he
continued
to
grow
worse
and
four
days
previous
to
our
arrival
in
he
died
one
of
the
sailors
sewed
him
in
his
blanket
with
a
large
stone
from
the
ballast
at
his
feet
and
then
laying
him
on
a
hatchway
and
elevating
it
with
tackles
above
the
railing
the
inanimate
body
of
poor
robert
was
consigned
to
the
white
waters
of
the
gulf
we
were
all
by
the
appearance
of
the
the
captain
ordered
lime
to
be
scattered
through
the
hold
and
other
prudent
precautions
to
be
taken
the
death
of
robert
however
and
the
presence
of
the
malady
oppressed
me
sadly
and
i
gazed
out
over
the
great
waste
of
waters
with
a
spirit
that
was
indeed
disconsolate
an
evening
or
two
after
robert
burial
i
was
leaning
on
the
hatchway
near
the
forecastle
full
of
desponding
thoughts
when
a
sailor
in
a
kind
voice
asked
me
why
i
was
so
the
tone
and
manner
of
the
man
assured
me
and
i
answered
because
i
was
a
freeman
and
had
been
kidnapped
he
remarked
that
it
was
enough
to
make
any
one
and
continued
to
interrogate
me
until
he
learned
the
particulars
of
my
whole
history
he
was
evidently
much
interested
in
my
behalf
and
in
the
blunt
speech
of
a
sailor
swore
he
would
aid
me
all
he
could
if
it
split
his
timbers
i
requested
him
to
furnish
me
pen
ink
and
paper
in
order
that
i
might
write
to
some
of
my
friends
he
promised
to
obtain
them
but
how
i
could
use
them
undiscovered
was
a
difficulty
if
i
could
only
get
into
the
forecastle
while
his
watch
was
off
and
the
other
sailors
asleep
the
thing
could
be
accomplished
the
small
boat
instantly
occurred
to
me
he
thought
we
were
not
far
from
the
balize
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
it
was
necessary
that
the
letter
be
written
soon
or
the
opportunity
would
be
lost
accordingly
by
arrangement
i
managed
the
next
night
to
secret
myself
again
under
the
his
watch
was
off
at
twelve
i
saw
him
pass
into
the
forecastle
and
in
about
an
hour
followed
him
he
was
nodding
over
a
table
half
asleep
on
which
a
sickly
light
was
flickering
and
on
which
also
was
a
pen
and
sheet
of
paper
as
i
entered
he
aroused
beckoned
me
to
a
seat
beside
him
and
pointed
to
the
paper
i
directed
the
letter
to
henry
northup
of
sandy
hill
stating
that
i
had
been
kidnapped
was
then
on
board
the
brig
orleans
bound
for
that
it
was
then
impossible
for
me
to
conjecture
my
ultimate
destination
and
requesting
he
would
take
measures
to
rescue
me
the
letter
was
sealed
and
directed
and
manning
having
read
it
promised
to
deposit
it
in
the
i
hastened
back
to
my
place
under
the
and
in
the
morning
as
the
slaves
came
up
and
were
walking
round
crept
out
unnoticed
and
mingled
with
them
my
good
friend
whose
name
was
john
manning
was
an
englishman
by
birth
and
a
generous
sailor
as
ever
walked
a
deck
he
had
lived
in
boston
was
a
tall
man
about
years
old
with
a
face
somewhat
but
full
of
benevolent
expression
nothing
to
vary
the
monotony
of
our
daily
life
occurred
until
we
reached
on
coming
to
the
levee
and
before
the
vessel
was
made
fast
i
saw
manning
leap
on
shore
and
hurry
away
into
the
city
as
he
started
off
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
significantly
giving
me
to
understand
the
object
of
his
errand
presently
he
returned
and
passing
close
by
me
hunched
me
with
his
elbow
with
a
peculiar
wink
as
much
as
to
say
it
is
all
right
the
letter
as
i
have
since
learned
reached
sandy
hill
northup
visited
albany
and
laid
it
before
governor
seward
but
inasmuch
as
it
gave
no
definite
information
as
to
my
probable
locality
it
was
not
at
that
time
deemed
advisable
to
institute
measures
for
my
liberation
it
was
concluded
to
delay
trusting
that
a
knowledge
of
where
i
was
might
eventually
be
obtained
a
happy
and
touching
scene
was
witnessed
immediately
upon
our
reaching
the
levee
just
as
manning
left
the
brig
on
his
way
to
the
two
men
came
up
and
called
aloud
for
arthur
the
latter
as
he
recognized
them
was
almost
crazy
with
delight
he
could
hardly
be
restrained
from
leaping
over
the
brig
side
and
when
they
met
soon
after
he
grasped
them
by
the
hand
and
clung
to
them
a
long
long
time
they
were
men
from
norfolk
who
had
come
on
to
to
rescue
him
his
kidnappers
they
informed
him
had
been
arrested
and
were
then
confined
in
the
norfolk
prison
they
conversed
a
few
moments
with
the
captain
and
then
departed
with
the
rejoicing
arthur
but
in
all
the
crowd
that
thronged
the
wharf
there
was
no
one
who
knew
or
cared
for
me
not
one
no
familiar
voice
greeted
my
ears
nor
was
there
a
single
face
that
i
had
ever
seen
soon
arthur
would
rejoin
his
family
and
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
wrongs
avenged
my
family
alas
should
i
ever
see
them
more
there
was
a
feeling
of
utter
desolation
in
my
heart
filling
it
with
a
despairing
and
regretful
sense
that
i
had
not
gone
down
with
robert
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
very
soon
traders
and
consignees
came
on
board
one
a
tall
man
with
light
complexion
and
a
little
bent
made
his
appearance
with
a
paper
in
his
hand
burch
gang
consisting
of
myself
eliza
and
her
children
harry
lethe
and
some
others
who
had
joined
us
at
richmond
were
consigned
to
him
this
gentleman
was
theophilus
freeman
reading
from
his
paper
he
called
platt
no
one
answered
the
name
was
called
again
and
again
but
still
there
was
no
reply
then
lethe
was
called
then
eliza
then
harry
until
the
list
was
finished
each
one
stepping
forward
as
his
or
her
name
was
called
captain
where
platt
demanded
theophilus
freeman
the
captain
was
unable
to
inform
him
no
one
being
on
board
answering
to
that
name
who
shipped
nigger
he
again
inquired
of
the
captain
pointing
to
me
burch
replied
the
captain
your
name
is
platt
you
answer
my
description
why
do
you
come
forward
he
demanded
of
me
in
an
angry
tone
i
informed
him
that
was
not
my
name
that
i
had
never
been
called
by
it
but
that
i
had
no
objection
to
it
as
i
knew
of
well
i
will
learn
you
your
name
said
he
and
so
you
wo
forget
it
either
by
he
added
theophilus
freeman
by
the
way
was
not
a
whit
behind
his
partner
burch
in
the
matter
of
blasphemy
on
the
vessel
i
had
gone
by
the
name
of
steward
and
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
been
designated
as
platt
the
name
forwarded
by
burch
to
his
consignee
from
the
vessel
i
observed
the
at
work
on
the
levee
we
passed
near
them
as
we
were
driven
to
freeman
slave
pen
this
pen
is
very
similar
to
goodin
in
richmond
except
the
yard
was
enclosed
by
plank
standing
upright
with
ends
sharpened
instead
of
brick
walls
including
us
there
were
now
at
least
fifty
in
this
pen
depositing
our
blankets
in
one
of
the
small
buildings
in
the
yard
and
having
been
called
up
and
fed
we
were
allowed
to
saunter
about
the
enclosure
until
night
when
we
wrapped
our
blankets
round
us
and
laid
down
under
the
shed
or
in
the
loft
or
in
the
open
yard
just
as
each
one
preferred
it
was
but
a
short
time
i
closed
my
eyes
that
night
thought
was
busy
in
my
brain
could
it
be
possible
that
i
was
thousands
of
miles
from
home
that
i
had
been
driven
through
the
streets
like
a
dumb
beast
that
i
had
been
chained
and
beaten
without
mercy
that
i
was
even
then
herded
with
a
drove
of
slaves
a
slave
myself
were
the
events
of
the
last
few
weeks
realities
indeed
or
was
i
passing
only
through
the
dismal
phases
of
a
long
protracted
dream
it
was
no
illusion
my
cup
of
sorrow
was
full
to
overflowing
then
i
lifted
up
my
hands
to
god
and
in
the
still
watches
of
the
night
surrounded
by
the
sleeping
forms
of
my
companions
begged
for
mercy
on
the
poor
forsaken
captive
to
the
almighty
father
of
us
all
the
freeman
and
the
slave
i
poured
forth
the
supplications
of
a
broken
spirit
imploring
strength
from
on
high
to
bear
up
against
the
burden
of
my
troubles
until
the
morning
light
aroused
the
slumberers
ushering
in
another

out
among
his
animals
early
in
the
morning
with
an
occasional
kick
of
the
older
men
and
women
and
many
a
sharp
crack
of
the
whip
about
the
ears
of
the
younger
slaves
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
all
astir
and
wide
awake
theophilus
freeman
bustled
about
in
a
very
industrious
manner
getting
his
property
ready
for
the
intending
no
doubt
to
do
that
day
a
rousing
business
in
the
first
place
we
were
required
to
wash
thoroughly
and
those
with
beards
to
shave
we
were
then
furnished
with
a
new
suit
each
cheap
but
clean
the
men
had
hat
coat
shirt
pants
and
shoes
the
women
frocks
of
calico
and
handkerchiefs
to
bind
about
their
heads
we
were
now
conducted
into
a
large
room
in
the
front
part
of
the
building
to
which
the
yard
was
attached
in
order
to
be
properly
trained
before
the
admission
of
customers
the
men
were
arranged
on
one
side
of
the
room
the
women
on
the
other
the
tallest
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
row
then
the
next
tallest
and
so
on
in
the
order
of
their
respective
heights
emily
was
at
the
foot
of
the
line
of
women
freeman
charged
us
to
remember
our
places
exhorted
us
to
appear
smart
and
lively
sometimes
threatening
and
again
holding
out
various
inducements
during
the
day
he
exercised
us
in
the
art
of
looking
smart
and
of
moving
to
our
places
with
exact
precision
after
being
fed
in
the
afternoon
we
were
again
paraded
and
made
to
dance
bob
a
colored
boy
who
had
some
time
belonged
to
freeman
played
on
the
violin
standing
near
him
i
made
bold
to
inquire
if
he
could
play
the
virginia
reel
he
answered
he
could
not
and
asked
me
if
i
could
play
replying
in
the
affirmative
he
handed
me
the
violin
i
struck
up
a
tune
and
finished
it
freeman
ordered
me
to
continue
playing
and
seemed
well
pleased
telling
bob
that
i
far
excelled
him
a
remark
that
seemed
to
grieve
my
musical
companion
very
much
next
day
many
customers
called
to
examine
freeman
new
lot
the
latter
gentleman
was
very
loquacious
dwelling
at
much
length
upon
our
several
good
points
and
qualities
he
would
make
us
hold
up
our
heads
walk
briskly
back
and
forth
while
customers
would
feel
of
our
hands
and
arms
and
bodies
turn
us
about
ask
us
what
we
could
do
make
us
open
our
mouths
and
show
our
teeth
precisely
as
a
jockey
examines
a
horse
which
he
is
about
to
barter
for
or
purchase
sometimes
a
man
or
woman
was
taken
back
to
the
small
house
in
the
yard
stripped
and
inspected
more
minutely
scars
upon
a
slave
back
were
considered
evidence
of
a
rebellious
or
unruly
spirit
and
hurt
his
sale
one
old
gentleman
who
said
he
wanted
a
coachman
appeared
to
take
a
fancy
to
me
from
his
conversation
with
burch
i
learned
he
was
a
resident
in
the
city
i
very
much
desired
that
he
would
buy
me
because
i
conceived
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
make
my
escape
from
on
some
northern
vessel
freeman
asked
him
fifteen
hundred
dollars
for
me
the
old
gentleman
insisted
it
was
too
much
as
times
were
very
hard
freeman
however
declared
that
i
was
sound
and
healthy
of
a
good
constitution
and
intelligent
he
made
it
a
point
to
enlarge
upon
my
musical
attainments
the
old
gentleman
argued
quite
adroitly
that
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
about
the
nigger
and
finally
to
my
regret
went
out
saying
he
would
call
again
during
the
day
however
a
number
of
sales
were
made
david
and
caroline
were
purchased
together
by
a
natchez
planter
they
left
us
grinning
broadly
and
in
the
most
happy
state
of
mind
caused
by
the
fact
of
their
not
being
separated
lethe
was
sold
to
a
planter
of
baton
rouge
her
eyes
flashing
with
anger
as
she
was
led
away
the
same
man
also
purchased
randall
the
little
fellow
was
made
to
jump
and
run
across
the
floor
and
perform
many
other
feats
exhibiting
his
activity
and
condition
all
the
time
the
trade
was
going
on
eliza
was
crying
aloud
and
wringing
her
hands
she
besought
the
man
not
to
buy
him
unless
he
also
bought
herself
and
emily
she
promised
in
that
case
to
be
the
most
faithful
slave
that
ever
lived
the
man
answered
that
he
could
not
afford
it
and
then
eliza
burst
into
a
paroxysm
of
grief
weeping
plaintively
freeman
turned
round
to
her
savagely
with
his
whip
in
his
uplifted
hand
ordering
her
to
stop
her
noise
or
he
would
flog
her
he
would
not
have
such
work
such
snivelling
and
unless
she
ceased
that
minute
he
would
take
her
to
the
yard
and
give
her
a
hundred
lashes
yes
he
would
take
the
nonsense
out
of
her
pretty
quick
if
he
did
might
he
be
d
eliza
shrunk
before
him
and
tried
to
wipe
away
her
tears
but
it
was
all
in
vain
she
wanted
to
be
with
her
children
she
said
the
little
time
she
had
to
live
all
the
frowns
and
threats
of
freeman
could
not
wholly
silence
the
afflicted
mother
she
kept
on
begging
and
beseeching
them
most
piteously
not
to
separate
the
three
over
and
over
again
she
told
them
how
she
loved
her
boy
a
great
many
times
she
repeated
her
former
promises
how
very
faithful
and
obedient
she
would
be
how
hard
she
would
labor
day
and
night
to
the
last
moment
of
her
life
if
he
would
only
buy
them
all
together
but
it
was
of
no
avail
the
man
could
not
afford
it
the
bargain
was
agreed
upon
and
randall
must
go
alone
then
eliza
ran
to
him
embraced
him
passionately
kissed
him
again
and
again
told
him
to
remember
her
all
the
while
her
tears
falling
in
the
boy
face
like
rain
freeman
damned
her
calling
her
a
blubbering
bawling
wench
and
ordered
her
to
go
to
her
place
and
behave
herself
and
be
somebody
he
swore
he
would
stand
such
stuff
but
a
little
longer
he
would
soon
give
her
something
to
cry
about
if
she
was
not
mighty
careful
and
she
might
depend
upon
the
planter
from
baton
rouge
with
his
new
purchases
was
ready
to
depart
do
cry
mama
i
will
be
a
good
boy
do
cry
said
randall
looking
back
as
they
passed
out
of
the
door
what
has
become
of
the
lad
god
knows
it
was
a
mournful
scene
indeed
i
would
have
cried
myself
if
i
had
dared
that
night
nearly
all
who
came
in
on
the
brig
orleans
were
taken
ill
they
complained
of
violent
pain
in
the
head
and
back
little
emily
a
thing
unusual
with
her
cried
constantly
in
the
morning
a
physician
was
called
in
but
was
unable
to
determine
the
nature
of
our
complaint
while
examining
me
and
asking
questions
touching
my
symptoms
i
gave
it
as
my
opinion
that
it
was
an
attack
of
mentioning
the
fact
of
robert
death
as
the
reason
of
my
belief
it
might
be
so
indeed
he
thought
and
he
would
send
for
the
head
physician
of
the
hospital
shortly
the
head
physician
came
a
small
man
whom
they
called
carr
he
pronounced
it
whereupon
there
was
much
alarm
throughout
the
yard
soon
after
carr
left
eliza
emmy
harry
and
myself
were
put
into
a
hack
and
driven
to
the
hospital
a
large
white
marble
building
standing
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
harry
and
i
were
placed
in
a
room
in
one
of
the
upper
stories
i
became
very
sick
for
three
days
i
was
entirely
blind
while
lying
in
this
state
one
day
bob
came
in
saying
to
carr
that
freeman
had
sent
him
over
to
inquire
how
we
were
getting
on
tell
him
said
the
doctor
that
platt
is
very
bad
but
that
if
he
survives
until
nine
he
may
recover
i
expected
to
die
though
there
was
little
in
the
prospect
before
me
worth
living
for
the
near
approach
of
death
appalled
me
i
thought
i
could
have
been
resigned
to
yield
up
my
life
in
the
bosom
of
my
family
but
to
expire
in
the
midst
of
strangers
under
such
circumstances
was
a
bitter
reflection
there
were
a
great
number
in
the
hospital
of
both
sexes
and
of
all
ages
in
the
rear
of
the
building
coffins
were
manufactured
when
one
died
the
bell
tolled
a
signal
to
the
undertaker
to
come
and
bear
away
the
body
to
the
potter
field
many
times
each
day
and
night
the
tolling
bell
sent
forth
its
melancholy
voice
announcing
another
death
but
my
time
had
not
yet
come
the
crisis
having
passed
i
began
to
revive
and
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
and
two
days
returned
with
harry
to
the
pen
bearing
upon
my
face
the
effects
of
the
malady
which
to
this
day
continues
to
disfigure
it
eliza
and
emily
were
also
brought
back
next
day
in
a
hack
and
again
were
we
paraded
in
the
for
the
inspection
and
examination
of
purchasers
i
still
indulged
the
hope
that
the
old
gentleman
in
search
of
a
coachman
would
call
again
as
he
had
promised
and
purchase
me
in
that
event
i
felt
an
abiding
confidence
that
i
would
soon
regain
my
liberty
customer
after
customer
entered
but
the
old
gentleman
never
made
his
appearance
at
length
one
day
while
we
were
in
the
yard
freeman
came
out
and
ordered
us
to
our
places
in
the
great
room
a
gentleman
was
waiting
for
us
as
we
entered
and
inasmuch
as
he
will
be
often
mentioned
in
the
progress
of
this
narrative
a
description
of
his
personal
appearance
and
my
estimation
of
his
character
at
first
sight
may
not
be
out
of
place
he
was
a
man
above
the
ordinary
height
somewhat
bent
and
stooping
forward
he
was
a
man
and
appeared
to
have
reached
about
the
middle
age
of
life
there
was
nothing
repulsive
in
his
presence
but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
something
cheerful
and
attractive
in
his
face
and
in
his
tone
of
voice
the
finer
elements
were
all
kindly
mingled
in
his
breast
as
any
one
could
see
he
moved
about
among
us
asking
many
questions
as
to
what
we
could
do
and
what
labor
we
had
been
accustomed
to
if
we
thought
we
would
like
to
live
with
him
and
would
be
good
boys
if
he
would
buy
us
and
other
interrogatories
of
like
character
after
some
further
inspection
and
conversation
touching
prices
he
finally
offered
freeman
one
thousand
dollars
for
me
nine
hundred
for
harry
and
seven
hundred
for
eliza
whether
the
had
depreciated
our
value
or
from
what
cause
freeman
had
concluded
to
fall
five
hundred
dollars
from
the
price
i
was
before
held
at
i
can
not
say
at
any
rate
after
a
little
shrewd
reflection
he
announced
his
acceptance
of
the
offer
as
soon
as
eliza
heard
it
she
was
in
an
agony
again
by
this
time
she
had
become
haggard
and
with
sickness
and
with
sorrow
it
would
be
a
relief
if
i
could
consistently
pass
over
in
silence
the
scene
that
now
ensued
it
recalls
memories
more
mournful
and
affecting
than
any
language
can
portray
i
have
seen
mothers
kissing
for
the
last
time
the
faces
of
their
dead
offspring
i
have
seen
them
looking
down
into
the
grave
as
the
earth
fell
with
a
dull
sound
upon
their
coffins
hiding
them
from
their
eyes
forever
but
never
have
i
seen
such
an
exhibition
of
intense
unmeasured
and
unbounded
grief
as
when
eliza
was
parted
from
her
child
she
broke
from
her
place
in
the
line
of
women
and
rushing
down
where
emily
was
standing
caught
her
in
her
arms
the
child
sensible
of
some
impending
danger
instinctively
fastened
her
hands
around
her
mother
neck
and
nestled
her
little
head
upon
her
bosom
freeman
sternly
ordered
her
to
be
quiet
but
she
did
not
heed
him
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
pulled
her
rudely
but
she
only
clung
the
closer
to
the
child
then
with
a
volley
of
great
oaths
he
struck
her
such
a
heartless
blow
that
she
staggered
backward
and
was
like
to
fall
oh
how
piteously
then
did
she
beseech
and
beg
and
pray
that
they
might
not
be
separated
why
could
they
not
be
purchased
together
why
not
let
her
have
one
of
her
dear
children
mercy
mercy
master
she
cried
falling
on
her
knees
please
master
buy
emily
i
can
never
work
any
if
she
is
taken
from
me
i
will
die
freeman
interfered
again
but
disregarding
him
she
still
plead
most
earnestly
telling
how
randall
had
been
taken
from
her
how
she
never
would
see
him
again
and
now
it
was
too
bad
oh
god
it
was
too
bad
too
cruel
to
take
her
away
from
emily
her
pride
her
only
darling
that
could
not
live
it
was
so
young
without
its
mother
finally
after
much
more
of
supplication
the
purchaser
of
eliza
stepped
forward
evidently
affected
and
said
to
freeman
he
would
buy
emily
and
asked
him
what
her
price
was
what
is
her
her
was
the
responsive
interrogatory
of
theophilus
freeman
and
instantly
answering
his
own
inquiry
he
added
i
wo
sell
her
she
not
for
sale
the
man
remarked
he
was
not
in
need
of
one
so
young
that
it
would
be
of
no
profit
to
him
but
since
the
mother
was
so
fond
of
her
rather
than
see
them
separated
he
would
pay
a
reasonable
price
but
to
this
humane
proposal
freeman
was
entirely
deaf
he
would
not
sell
her
then
on
any
account
whatever
there
were
heaps
and
piles
of
money
to
be
made
of
her
he
said
when
she
was
a
few
years
older
there
were
men
enough
in
who
would
give
five
thousand
dollars
for
such
an
extra
handsome
fancy
piece
as
emily
would
be
rather
than
not
get
her
no
no
he
would
not
sell
her
then
she
was
a
beauty
a
picture
a
doll
one
of
the
regular
bloods
none
of
your
niggers
if
she
was
might
he
be
d
when
eliza
heard
freeman
determination
not
to
part
with
emily
she
became
absolutely
frantic
i
will
go
without
her
they
shall
take
her
from
me
she
fairly
shrieked
her
shrieks
commingling
with
the
loud
and
angry
voice
of
freeman
commanding
her
to
be
silent
meantime
harry
and
myself
had
been
to
the
yard
and
returned
with
our
blankets
and
were
at
the
front
door
ready
to
leave
our
purchaser
stood
near
us
gazing
at
eliza
with
an
expression
indicative
of
regret
at
having
bought
her
at
the
expense
of
so
much
sorrow
we
waited
some
time
when
finally
freeman
out
of
patience
tore
emily
from
her
mother
by
main
force
the
two
clinging
to
each
other
with
all
their
might
do
leave
me
mama
do
leave
me
screamed
the
child
as
its
mother
was
pushed
harshly
forward
do
leave
me
come
back
mama
she
still
cried
stretching
forth
her
little
arms
imploringly
but
she
cried
in
vain
out
of
the
door
and
into
the
street
we
were
quickly
hurried
still
we
could
hear
her
calling
to
her
mother
come
back
do
leave
me
come
back
mama
until
her
infant
voice
grew
faint
and
still
more
faint
and
gradually
died
away
as
distance
intervened
and
finally
was
wholly
lost
eliza
never
after
saw
or
heard
of
emily
or
randall
day
nor
night
however
were
they
ever
absent
from
her
memory
in
the
cotton
field
in
the
cabin
always
and
everywhere
she
was
talking
of
them
often
them
as
if
they
were
actually
present
only
when
absorbed
in
that
illusion
or
asleep
did
she
ever
have
a
moment
comfort
afterwards
she
was
no
common
slave
as
has
been
said
to
a
large
share
of
natural
intelligence
which
she
possessed
was
added
a
general
knowledge
and
information
on
most
subjects
she
had
enjoyed
opportunities
such
as
are
afforded
to
very
few
of
her
oppressed
class
she
had
been
lifted
up
into
the
regions
of
a
higher
life
freedom
freedom
for
herself
and
for
her
offspring
for
many
years
had
been
her
cloud
by
day
her
pillar
of
fire
by
night
in
her
pilgrimage
through
the
wilderness
of
bondage
with
eyes
fixed
upon
that
beacon
she
had
at
length
ascended
to
the
top
of
pisgah
and
beheld
the
land
of
promise
in
an
unexpected
moment
she
was
utterly
overwhelmed
with
disappointment
and
despair
the
glorious
vision
of
liberty
faded
from
her
sight
as
they
led
her
away
into
captivity
now
she
weepeth
sore
in
the
night
and
tears
are
on
her
cheeks
all
her
friends
have
dealt
treacherously
with
her
they
have
become
her
enemies

by

and

until
we
found
ourselves
on
board
the
steamboat
rodolph
then
lying
at
the
levee
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
we
were
moving
briskly
up
the
mississippi
bound
for
some
point
on
red
river
there
were
quite
a
number
of
slaves
on
board
beside
ourselves
just
purchased
in
the
market
i
remember
a
kelsow
who
was
said
to
be
a
well
known
and
extensive
planter
had
in
charge
a
gang
of
women
our
master
name
was
william
ford
he
resided
then
in
the
great
pine
woods
in
the
parish
of
avoyelles
situated
on
the
right
bank
of
red
river
in
the
heart
of
louisiana
he
is
now
a
baptist
preacher
throughout
the
whole
parish
of
avoyelles
and
especially
along
both
shores
of
bayou
boeuf
where
he
is
more
intimately
known
he
is
accounted
by
his
as
a
worthy
minister
of
god
in
many
northern
minds
perhaps
the
idea
of
a
man
holding
his
brother
man
in
servitude
and
the
traffic
in
human
flesh
may
seem
altogether
incompatible
with
their
conceptions
of
a
moral
or
religious
life
from
descriptions
of
such
men
as
burch
and
freeman
and
others
hereinafter
mentioned
they
are
led
to
despise
and
execrate
the
whole
class
of
slaveholders
indiscriminately
but
i
was
sometime
his
slave
and
had
an
opportunity
of
learning
well
his
character
and
disposition
and
it
is
but
simple
justice
to
him
when
i
say
in
my
opinion
there
never
was
a
more
kind
noble
candid
christian
man
than
william
ford
the
influences
and
associations
that
had
always
surrounded
him
blinded
him
to
the
inherent
wrong
at
the
bottom
of
the
system
of
slavery
he
never
doubted
the
moral
right
of
one
man
holding
another
in
subjection
looking
through
the
same
medium
with
his
fathers
before
him
he
saw
things
in
the
same
light
brought
up
under
other
circumstances
and
other
influences
his
notions
would
undoubtedly
have
been
different
nevertheless
he
was
a
model
master
walking
uprightly
according
to
the
light
of
his
understanding
and
fortunate
was
the
slave
who
came
to
his
possession
were
all
men
such
as
he
slavery
would
be
deprived
of
more
than
half
its
bitterness
we
were
two
days
and
three
nights
on
board
the
steamboat
rodolph
during
which
time
nothing
of
particular
interest
occurred
i
was
now
known
as
platt
the
name
given
me
by
burch
and
by
which
i
was
designated
through
the
whole
period
of
my
servitude
eliza
was
sold
by
the
name
of
dradey
she
was
so
distinguished
in
the
conveyance
to
ford
now
on
record
in
the
recorder
office
in
on
our
passage
i
was
constantly
reflecting
on
my
situation
and
consulting
with
myself
on
the
best
course
to
pursue
in
order
to
effect
my
ultimate
escape
sometimes
not
only
then
but
afterwards
i
was
almost
on
the
point
of
disclosing
fully
to
ford
the
facts
of
my
history
i
am
inclined
now
to
the
opinion
it
would
have
resulted
in
my
benefit
this
course
was
often
considered
but
through
fear
of
its
miscarriage
never
put
into
execution
until
eventually
my
transfer
and
his
pecuniary
embarrassments
rendered
it
evidently
unsafe
afterwards
under
other
masters
unlike
william
ford
i
knew
well
enough
the
slightest
knowledge
of
my
real
character
would
consign
me
at
once
to
the
remoter
depths
of
slavery
i
was
too
costly
a
chattel
to
be
lost
and
was
well
aware
that
i
would
be
taken
farther
on
into
some
over
the
texan
border
perhaps
and
sold
that
i
would
be
disposed
of
as
the
thief
disposes
of
his
stolen
horse
if
my
right
to
freedom
was
even
whispered
so
i
resolved
to
lock
the
secret
closely
in
my
heart
never
to
utter
one
word
or
syllable
as
to
who
or
what
i
was
trusting
in
providence
and
my
own
shrewdness
for
deliverance
at
length
we
left
the
steamboat
rodolph
at
a
place
called
alexandria
several
hundred
miles
from
it
is
a
small
town
on
the
southern
shore
of
red
river
having
remained
there
over
night
we
entered
the
morning
train
of
cars
and
were
soon
at
bayou
lamourie
a
still
smaller
place
distant
eighteen
miles
from
alexandria
at
that
time
it
was
the
termination
of
the
railroad
ford
plantation
was
situated
on
the
texas
road
twelve
miles
from
lamourie
in
the
great
pine
woods
this
distance
it
was
announced
to
us
must
be
traveled
on
foot
there
being
public
conveyances
no
farther
accordingly
we
all
set
out
in
the
company
of
ford
it
was
an
excessively
hot
day
harry
eliza
and
myself
were
yet
weak
and
the
bottoms
of
our
feet
were
very
tender
from
the
effects
of
the
we
proceeded
slowly
ford
telling
us
to
take
our
time
and
sit
down
and
rest
whenever
we
desired
a
privilege
that
was
taken
advantage
of
quite
frequently
after
leaving
lamourie
and
crossing
two
plantations
one
belonging
to
carnell
the
other
to
a
flint
we
reached
the
pine
woods
a
wilderness
that
stretches
to
the
sabine
river
the
whole
country
about
red
river
is
low
and
marshy
the
pine
woods
as
they
are
called
is
comparatively
upland
with
frequent
small
intervals
however
running
through
them
this
upland
is
covered
with
numerous
trees
the
white
oak
the
chincopin
resembling
chestnut
but
principally
the
yellow
pine
they
are
of
great
size
running
up
sixty
feet
and
perfectly
straight
the
woods
were
full
of
cattle
very
shy
and
wild
dashing
away
in
herds
with
a
loud
snuff
at
our
approach
some
of
them
were
marked
or
branded
the
rest
appeared
to
be
in
their
wild
and
untamed
state
they
are
much
smaller
than
northern
breeds
and
the
peculiarity
about
them
that
most
attracted
my
attention
was
their
horns
they
stand
out
from
the
sides
of
the
head
precisely
straight
like
two
iron
spikes
at
noon
we
reached
a
cleared
piece
of
ground
containing
three
or
four
acres
upon
it
was
a
small
unpainted
wooden
house
a
corn
crib
or
as
we
would
say
a
barn
and
a
log
kitchen
standing
about
a
rod
from
the
house
it
was
the
summer
residence
of
martin
rich
planters
having
large
establishments
on
bayou
boeuf
are
accustomed
to
spend
the
warmer
season
in
these
woods
here
they
find
clear
water
and
delightful
shades
in
fact
these
retreats
are
to
the
planters
of
that
section
of
the
country
what
newport
and
saratoga
are
to
the
wealthier
inhabitants
of
northern
cities
we
were
sent
around
into
the
kitchen
and
supplied
with
sweet
potatoes
and
bacon
while
master
ford
dined
with
martin
in
the
house
there
were
several
slaves
about
the
premises
martin
came
out
and
took
a
look
at
us
asking
ford
the
price
of
each
if
we
were
green
hands
and
so
forth
and
making
inquiries
in
relation
to
the
slave
market
generally
after
a
long
rest
we
set
forth
again
following
the
texas
road
which
had
the
appearance
of
being
very
rarely
traveled
for
five
miles
we
passed
through
continuous
woods
without
observing
a
single
habitation
at
length
just
as
the
sun
was
sinking
in
the
west
we
entered
another
opening
containing
some
twelve
or
fifteen
acres
in
this
opening
stood
a
house
much
larger
than
martin
it
was
two
stories
high
with
a
piazza
in
front
in
the
rear
of
it
was
also
a
log
kitchen
poultry
house
corncribs
and
several
negro
cabins
near
the
house
was
a
peach
orchard
and
gardens
of
orange
and
pomegranate
trees
the
space
was
entirely
surrounded
by
woods
and
covered
with
a
carpet
of
rich
rank
verdure
it
was
a
quiet
lonely
pleasant
place
literally
a
green
spot
in
the
wilderness
it
was
the
residence
of
my
master
william
ford
as
we
approached
a
yellow
girl
her
name
was
rose
was
standing
on
the
piazza
going
to
the
door
she
called
her
mistress
who
presently
came
running
out
to
meet
her
lord
she
kissed
him
and
laughingly
demanded
if
he
had
bought
those
niggers
ford
said
he
had
and
told
us
to
go
round
to
sally
cabin
and
rest
ourselves
turning
the
corner
of
the
house
we
discovered
sally
washing
her
two
baby
children
near
her
rolling
on
the
grass
they
jumped
up
and
toddled
towards
us
looked
at
us
a
moment
like
a
brace
of
rabbits
then
ran
back
to
their
mother
as
if
afraid
of
us
sally
conducted
us
into
the
cabin
told
us
to
lay
down
our
bundles
and
be
seated
for
she
was
sure
that
we
were
tired
just
then
john
the
cook
a
boy
some
sixteen
years
of
age
and
blacker
than
any
crow
came
running
in
looked
steadily
in
our
faces
then
turning
round
without
saying
as
much
as
how
d
do
ran
back
to
the
kitchen
laughing
loudly
as
if
our
coming
was
a
great
joke
indeed
much
wearied
with
our
walk
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
harry
and
i
wrapped
our
blankets
round
us
and
laid
down
upon
the
cabin
floor
my
thoughts
as
usual
wandered
back
to
my
wife
and
children
the
consciousness
of
my
real
situation
the
hopelessness
of
any
effort
to
escape
through
the
wide
forests
of
avoyelles
pressed
heavily
upon
me
yet
my
heart
was
at
home
in
saratoga
i
was
awakened
early
in
the
morning
by
the
voice
of
master
ford
calling
rose
she
hastened
into
the
house
to
dress
the
children
sally
to
the
field
to
milk
the
cows
while
john
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
preparing
breakfast
in
the
meantime
harry
and
i
were
strolling
about
the
yard
looking
at
our
new
quarters
just
after
breakfast
a
colored
man
driving
three
yoke
of
oxen
attached
to
a
wagon
load
of
lumber
drove
into
the
opening
he
was
a
slave
of
ford
named
walton
the
husband
of
rose
by
the
way
rose
was
a
native
of
washington
and
had
been
brought
from
thence
five
years
before
she
had
never
seen
eliza
but
she
had
heard
of
berry
and
they
knew
the
same
streets
and
the
same
people
either
personally
or
by
reputation
they
became
fast
friends
immediately
and
talked
a
great
deal
together
of
old
times
and
of
friends
they
had
left
behind
ford
was
at
that
time
a
wealthy
man
besides
his
seat
in
the
pine
woods
he
owned
a
large
lumbering
establishment
on
indian
creek
four
miles
distant
and
also
in
his
wife
right
an
extensive
plantation
and
many
slaves
on
bayou
boeuf
walton
had
come
with
his
load
of
lumber
from
the
mills
on
indian
creek
ford
directed
us
to
return
with
him
saying
he
would
follow
us
as
soon
as
possible
before
leaving
mistress
ford
called
me
into
the
and
handed
me
as
it
is
there
termed
a
tin
bucket
of
molasses
for
harry
and
myself
eliza
was
still
ringing
her
hands
and
deploring
the
loss
of
her
children
ford
tried
as
much
as
possible
to
console
her
told
her
she
need
not
work
very
hard
that
she
might
remain
with
rose
and
assist
the
madam
in
the
house
affairs
riding
with
walton
in
the
wagon
harry
and
i
became
quite
well
acquainted
with
him
long
before
reaching
indian
creek
he
was
a
born
thrall
of
ford
and
spoke
kindly
and
affectionately
of
him
as
a
child
would
speak
of
his
own
father
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
from
whence
i
came
i
told
him
from
washington
of
that
city
he
had
heard
much
from
his
wife
rose
and
all
the
way
plied
me
with
many
extravagant
and
absurd
questions
on
reaching
the
mills
at
indian
creek
we
found
two
more
of
slaves
sam
and
antony
sam
also
was
a
washingtonian
having
been
brought
out
in
the
same
gang
with
rose
he
had
worked
on
a
farm
near
georgetown
antony
was
a
blacksmith
from
kentucky
who
had
been
in
his
present
master
service
about
ten
years
sam
knew
burch
and
when
informed
that
he
was
the
trader
who
had
sent
me
on
from
washington
it
was
remarkable
how
well
we
agreed
upon
the
subject
of
his
superlative
rascality
he
had
forwarded
sam
also
on
ford
arrival
at
the
mill
we
were
employed
in
piling
lumber
and
chopping
logs
which
occupation
we
continued
during
the
remainder
of
the
summer
we
usually
spent
our
sabbaths
at
the
opening
on
which
days
our
master
would
gather
all
his
slaves
about
him
and
read
and
expound
the
scriptures
he
sought
to
inculcate
in
our
minds
feelings
of
kindness
towards
each
other
of
dependence
upon
god
setting
forth
the
rewards
promised
unto
those
who
lead
an
upright
and
prayerful
life
seated
in
the
doorway
of
his
house
surrounded
by
his
and
his
who
looked
earnestly
into
the
good
man
face
he
spoke
of
the
loving
kindness
of
the
creator
and
of
the
life
that
is
to
come
often
did
the
voice
of
prayer
ascend
from
his
lips
to
heaven
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
solitude
of
the
place
in
the
course
of
the
summer
sam
became
deeply
convicted
his
mind
dwelling
intensely
on
the
subject
of
religion
his
mistress
gave
him
a
bible
which
he
carried
with
him
to
his
work
whatever
leisure
time
was
allowed
him
he
spent
in
perusing
it
though
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
he
could
master
any
part
of
it
i
often
read
to
him
a
favor
which
he
well
repaid
me
by
many
expressions
of
gratitude
sam
piety
was
frequently
observed
by
white
men
who
came
to
the
mill
and
the
remark
it
most
generally
provoked
was
that
a
man
like
ford
who
allowed
his
slaves
to
have
bibles
was
not
fit
to
own
a
nigger
he
however
lost
nothing
by
his
kindness
it
is
a
fact
i
have
more
than
once
observed
that
those
who
treated
their
slaves
most
leniently
were
rewarded
by
the
greatest
amount
of
labor
i
know
it
from
my
own
experience
it
was
a
source
of
pleasure
to
surprise
master
ford
with
a
greater
day
work
than
was
required
while
under
subsequent
masters
there
was
no
prompter
to
extra
effort
but
the
overseer
lash
it
was
the
desire
of
ford
approving
voice
that
suggested
to
me
an
idea
that
resulted
to
his
profit
the
lumber
we
were
manufacturing
was
contracted
to
be
delivered
at
lamourie
it
had
hitherto
been
transported
by
land
and
was
an
important
item
of
expense
indian
creek
upon
which
the
mills
were
situated
was
a
narrow
but
deep
stream
emptying
into
bayou
boeuf
in
some
places
it
was
not
more
than
twelve
feet
wide
and
much
obstructed
with
trunks
of
trees
bayou
boeuf
was
connected
with
bayou
lamourie
i
ascertained
the
distance
from
the
mills
to
the
point
on
the
latter
bayou
where
our
lumber
was
to
be
delivered
was
but
a
few
miles
less
by
land
than
by
water
provided
the
creek
could
be
made
navigable
for
rafts
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
expense
of
transportation
would
be
materially
diminished
adam
taydem
a
little
white
man
who
had
been
a
soldier
in
florida
and
had
strolled
into
that
distant
region
was
foreman
and
superintendent
of
the
mills
he
scouted
the
idea
but
ford
when
i
laid
it
before
him
received
it
favorably
and
permitted
me
to
try
the
experiment
having
removed
the
obstructions
i
made
up
a
narrow
raft
consisting
of
twelve
cribs
at
this
business
i
think
i
was
quite
skillful
not
having
forgotten
my
experience
years
before
on
the
champlain
canal
i
labored
hard
being
extremely
anxious
to
succeed
both
from
a
desire
to
please
my
master
and
to
show
adam
taydem
that
my
scheme
was
not
such
a
visionary
one
as
he
incessantly
pronounced
it
one
hand
could
manage
three
cribs
i
took
charge
of
the
forward
three
and
commenced
poling
down
the
creek
in
due
time
we
entered
the
first
bayou
and
finally
reached
our
destination
in
a
shorter
period
of
time
than
i
had
anticipated
the
arrival
of
the
raft
at
lamourie
created
a
sensation
while
ford
loaded
me
with
commendations
on
all
sides
i
heard
ford
platt
pronounced
the
smartest
nigger
in
the
pine
woods
in
fact
i
was
the
fulton
of
indian
creek
i
was
not
insensible
to
the
praise
bestowed
upon
me
and
enjoyed
especially
my
triumph
over
taydem
whose
ridicule
had
stung
my
pride
from
this
time
the
entire
control
of
bringing
the
lumber
to
lamourie
was
placed
in
my
hands
until
the
contract
was
fulfilled
indian
creek
in
its
whole
length
flows
through
a
magnificent
forest
there
dwells
on
its
shore
a
tribe
of
indians
a
remnant
of
the
chickasaws
or
chickopees
if
i
remember
rightly
they
live
in
simple
huts
ten
or
twelve
feet
square
constructed
of
pine
poles
and
covered
with
bark
they
subsist
principally
on
the
flesh
of
the
deer
the
coon
and
opossum
all
of
which
are
plenty
in
these
woods
sometimes
they
exchange
venison
for
a
little
corn
and
whisky
with
the
planters
on
the
bayous
their
usual
dress
is
buckskin
breeches
and
calico
hunting
shirts
of
fantastic
colors
buttoned
from
belt
to
chin
they
wear
brass
rings
on
their
wrists
and
in
their
ears
and
noses
the
dress
of
the
squaws
is
very
similar
they
are
fond
of
dogs
and
horses
owning
many
of
the
latter
of
a
small
tough
breed
and
are
skillful
riders
their
bridles
girths
and
saddles
were
made
of
raw
skins
of
animals
their
stirrups
of
a
certain
kind
of
wood
mounted
astride
their
ponies
men
and
women
i
have
seen
them
dash
out
into
the
woods
at
the
utmost
of
their
speed
following
narrow
winding
paths
and
dodging
trees
in
a
manner
that
eclipsed
the
most
miraculous
feats
of
civilized
equestrianism
circling
away
in
various
directions
the
forest
echoing
and
with
their
whoops
they
would
presently
return
at
the
same
dashing
headlong
speed
with
which
they
started
their
village
was
on
indian
creek
known
as
indian
castle
but
their
range
extended
to
the
sabine
river
occasionally
a
tribe
from
texas
would
come
over
on
a
visit
and
then
there
was
indeed
a
carnival
in
the
great
pine
woods
chief
of
the
tribe
was
cascalla
second
in
rank
john
baltese
his
with
both
of
whom
as
with
many
others
of
the
tribe
i
became
acquainted
during
my
frequent
voyages
down
the
creek
with
rafts
sam
and
myself
would
often
visit
them
when
the
day
task
was
done
they
were
obedient
to
the
chief
the
word
of
cascalla
was
their
law
they
were
a
rude
but
harmless
people
and
enjoyed
their
wild
mode
of
life
they
had
little
fancy
for
the
open
country
the
cleared
lands
on
the
shores
of
the
bayous
but
preferred
to
hide
themselves
within
the
shadows
of
the
forest
they
worshiped
the
great
spirit
loved
whisky
and
were
happy
on
one
occasion
i
was
present
at
a
dance
when
a
roving
herd
from
texas
had
encamped
in
their
village
the
entire
carcass
of
a
deer
was
roasting
before
a
large
fire
which
threw
its
light
a
long
distance
among
the
trees
under
which
they
were
assembled
when
they
had
formed
in
a
ring
men
and
squaws
alternately
a
sort
of
indian
fiddle
set
up
an
indescribable
tune
it
was
a
continuous
melancholy
kind
of
wavy
sound
with
the
slightest
possible
variation
at
the
first
note
if
indeed
there
was
more
than
one
note
in
the
whole
tune
they
circled
around
trotting
after
each
other
and
giving
utterance
to
a
guttural
noise
equally
as
nondescript
as
the
music
of
the
fiddle
at
the
end
of
the
third
circuit
they
would
stop
suddenly
whoop
as
if
their
lungs
would
crack
then
break
from
the
ring
forming
in
couples
man
and
squaw
each
jumping
backwards
as
far
as
possible
from
the
other
then
forwards
which
graceful
feat
having
been
twice
or
thrice
accomplished
they
would
form
in
a
ring
and
go
trotting
round
again
the
best
dancer
appeared
to
be
considered
the
one
who
could
whoop
the
loudest
jump
the
farthest
and
utter
the
most
excruciating
noise
at
intervals
one
or
more
would
leave
the
dancing
circle
and
going
to
the
fire
cut
from
the
roasting
carcass
a
slice
of
venison
in
a
hole
shaped
like
a
mortar
cut
in
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
they
pounded
corn
with
a
wooden
pestle
and
of
the
meal
made
cake
alternately
they
danced
and
ate
thus
were
the
visitors
from
texas
entertained
by
the
dusky
sons
and
daughters
of
the
chicopees
and
such
is
a
description
as
i
saw
it
of
an
indian
ball
in
the
pine
woods
of
avoyelles
in
the
autumn
i
left
the
mills
and
was
employed
at
the
opening
one
day
the
mistress
was
urging
ford
to
procure
a
loom
in
order
that
sally
might
commence
weaving
cloth
for
the
winter
garments
of
the
slaves
he
could
not
imagine
where
one
was
to
be
found
when
i
suggested
that
the
easiest
way
to
get
one
would
be
to
make
it
informing
him
at
the
same
time
that
i
was
a
sort
of
jack
at
all
trades
and
would
attempt
it
with
his
permission
it
was
granted
very
readily
and
i
was
allowed
to
go
to
a
neighboring
to
inspect
one
before
commencing
the
undertaking
at
length
it
was
finished
and
pronounced
by
sally
to
be
perfect
she
could
easily
weave
her
task
of
fourteen
yards
milk
the
cows
and
have
leisure
time
besides
each
day
it
worked
so
well
i
was
continued
in
the
employment
of
making
looms
which
were
taken
down
to
the
plantation
on
the
bayou
at
this
time
one
john
tibeats
a
carpenter
came
to
the
opening
to
do
some
work
on
master
house
i
was
directed
to
quit
the
looms
and
assist
him
for
two
weeks
i
was
in
his
company
planning
and
matching
boards
for
ceiling
a
plastered
room
being
a
rare
thing
in
the
parish
of
avoyelles
john
tibeats
was
the
opposite
of
ford
in
all
respects
he
was
a
small
crabbed
spiteful
man
he
had
no
fixed
residence
that
i
ever
heard
of
but
passed
from
one
plantation
to
another
wherever
he
could
find
employment
he
was
without
standing
in
the
community
not
esteemed
by
white
men
nor
even
respected
by
slaves
he
was
ignorant
withal
and
of
a
revengeful
disposition
he
left
the
parish
long
before
i
did
and
i
know
not
whether
he
is
at
present
alive
or
dead
certain
it
is
it
was
a
most
unlucky
day
for
me
that
brought
us
together
during
my
residence
with
master
ford
i
had
seen
only
the
bright
side
of
slavery
his
was
no
heavy
hand
crushing
us
to
the
earth
pointed
upwards
and
with
benign
and
cheering
words
addressed
us
as
his
accountable
like
himself
to
the
maker
of
us
all
i
think
of
him
with
affection
and
had
my
family
been
with
me
could
have
borne
his
gentle
servitude
without
murmuring
all
my
days
but
clouds
were
gathering
in
the
horizon
forerunners
of
a
pitiless
storm
that
was
soon
to
break
over
me
i
was
doomed
to
endure
such
bitter
trials
as
the
poor
slave
only
knows
and
to
lead
no
more
the
comparatively
happy
life
which
i
had
led

great

william
ford
unfortunately
became
embarrassed
in
his
pecuniary
affairs
a
heavy
judgment
was
rendered
against
him
in
consequence
of
his
having
become
security
for
his
brother
franklin
ford
residing
on
red
river
above
alexandria
and
who
had
failed
to
meet
his
liabilities
he
was
also
indebted
to
john
tibeats
to
a
considerable
amount
in
consideration
of
his
services
in
building
the
mills
on
indian
creek
and
also
a
and
other
erections
on
the
plantation
at
bayou
boeuf
not
yet
completed
it
was
therefore
necessary
in
order
to
meet
these
demands
to
dispose
of
eighteen
slaves
myself
among
the
number
seventeen
of
them
including
sam
and
harry
were
purchased
by
peter
compton
a
planter
also
residing
on
red
river
i
was
sold
to
tibeats
in
consequence
undoubtedly
of
my
slight
skill
as
a
carpenter
this
was
in
the
winter
of
the
deed
of
myself
from
freeman
to
ford
as
i
ascertained
from
the
public
records
in
on
my
return
was
dated
june
at
the
time
of
my
sale
to
tibeats
the
price
agreed
to
be
given
for
me
being
more
than
the
debt
ford
took
a
chattel
mortgage
of
four
hundred
dollars
i
am
indebted
for
my
life
as
will
hereafter
be
seen
to
that
mortgage
i
bade
farewell
to
my
good
friends
at
the
opening
and
departed
with
my
new
master
tibeats
we
went
down
to
the
plantation
on
bayou
boeuf
distant
miles
from
the
pine
woods
to
complete
the
unfinished
contract
bayou
boeuf
is
a
sluggish
winding
stream
one
of
those
stagnant
bodies
of
water
common
in
that
region
setting
back
from
red
river
it
stretches
from
a
point
not
far
from
alexandria
in
a
direction
and
following
its
tortuous
course
is
more
than
fifty
miles
in
length
large
cotton
and
sugar
plantations
line
each
shore
extending
back
to
the
borders
of
interminable
swamps
it
is
alive
with
alligators
rendering
it
unsafe
for
swine
or
unthinking
slave
children
to
stroll
along
its
banks
upon
a
bend
in
this
bayou
a
short
distance
from
cheneyville
was
situated
the
plantation
of
madam
ford
her
brother
peter
tanner
a
great
landholder
living
on
the
opposite
side
on
my
arrival
at
bayou
boeuf
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
eliza
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
several
months
she
had
not
pleased
ford
being
more
occupied
in
brooding
over
her
sorrows
than
in
attending
to
her
business
and
had
in
consequence
been
sent
down
to
work
in
the
field
on
the
plantation
she
had
grown
feeble
and
emaciated
and
was
still
mourning
for
her
children
she
asked
me
if
i
had
forgotten
them
and
a
great
many
times
inquired
if
i
still
remembered
how
handsome
little
emily
was
how
much
randall
loved
her
and
wondered
if
they
were
living
still
and
where
the
darlings
could
then
be
she
had
sunk
beneath
the
weight
of
an
excessive
grief
her
drooping
form
and
hollow
cheeks
too
plainly
indicated
that
she
had
well
nigh
reached
the
end
of
her
weary
road
ford
overseer
on
this
plantation
and
who
had
the
exclusive
charge
of
it
was
a
chapin
a
man
and
a
native
of
pennsylvania
in
common
with
others
he
held
tibeats
in
light
estimation
which
fact
in
connection
with
the
four
hundred
dollar
mortgage
was
fortunate
for
me
i
was
now
compelled
to
labor
very
hard
from
earliest
dawn
until
late
at
night
i
was
not
allowed
to
be
a
moment
idle
notwithstanding
which
tibeats
was
never
satisfied
he
was
continually
cursing
and
complaining
he
never
spoke
to
me
a
kind
word
i
was
his
faithful
slave
and
earned
him
large
wages
every
day
and
yet
i
went
to
my
cabin
nightly
loaded
with
abuse
and
stinging
epithets
we
had
completed
the
corn
mill
the
kitchen
and
so
forth
and
were
at
work
upon
the
when
i
was
guilty
of
an
act
in
that
state
punishable
with
death
it
was
my
first
fight
with
tibeats
the
we
were
erecting
stood
in
the
orchard
a
few
rods
from
the
residence
of
chapin
or
the
great
house
as
it
was
called
one
night
having
worked
until
it
was
too
dark
to
see
i
was
ordered
by
tibeats
to
rise
very
early
in
the
morning
procure
a
keg
of
nails
from
chapin
and
commence
putting
on
the
clapboards
i
retired
to
the
cabin
extremely
tired
and
having
cooked
a
supper
of
bacon
and
corn
cake
and
conversed
a
while
with
eliza
who
occupied
the
same
cabin
as
also
did
lawson
and
his
wife
mary
and
a
slave
named
bristol
laid
down
upon
the
ground
floor
little
dreaming
of
the
sufferings
that
awaited
me
on
the
morrow
before
daylight
i
was
on
the
piazza
of
the
great
house
awaiting
the
appearance
of
overseer
chapin
to
have
aroused
him
from
his
slumbers
and
stated
my
errand
would
have
been
an
unpardonable
boldness
at
length
he
came
out
taking
off
my
hat
i
informed
him
master
tibeats
had
directed
me
to
call
upon
him
for
a
keg
of
nails
going
into
the
he
rolled
it
out
at
the
same
time
saying
if
tibeats
preferred
a
different
size
he
would
endeavor
to
furnish
them
but
that
i
might
use
those
until
further
directed
then
mounting
his
horse
which
stood
saddled
and
bridled
at
the
door
he
rode
away
into
the
field
whither
the
slaves
had
preceded
him
while
i
took
the
keg
on
my
shoulder
and
proceeding
to
the
broke
in
the
head
and
commenced
nailing
on
the
clapboards
as
the
day
began
to
open
tibeats
came
out
of
the
house
to
where
i
was
hard
at
work
he
seemed
to
be
that
morning
even
more
morose
and
disagreeable
than
usual
he
was
my
master
entitled
by
law
to
my
flesh
and
blood
and
to
exercise
over
me
such
tyrannical
control
as
his
mean
nature
prompted
but
there
was
no
law
that
could
prevent
my
looking
upon
him
with
intense
contempt
i
despised
both
his
disposition
and
his
intellect
i
had
just
come
round
to
the
keg
for
a
further
supply
of
nails
as
he
reached
the
i
thought
i
told
you
to
commence
putting
on
this
morning
he
remarked
yes
master
and
i
am
about
it
i
replied
where
he
demanded
on
the
other
side
was
my
answer
he
walked
round
to
the
other
side
examined
my
work
for
a
while
muttering
to
himself
in
a
tone
did
i
tell
you
last
night
to
get
a
keg
of
nails
of
chapin
he
broke
forth
again
yes
master
and
so
i
did
and
overseer
said
he
would
get
another
size
for
you
if
you
wanted
them
when
he
came
back
from
the
field
tibeats
walked
to
the
keg
looked
a
moment
at
the
contents
then
kicked
it
violently
coming
towards
me
in
a
great
passion
he
exclaimed
g
d
d
n
you
i
thought
you
something
i
made
answer
i
tried
to
do
as
you
told
me
master
i
did
mean
anything
wrong
overseer
said
but
he
interrupted
me
with
such
a
flood
of
curses
that
i
was
unable
to
finish
the
sentence
at
length
he
ran
towards
the
house
and
going
to
the
piazza
took
down
one
of
the
overseer
whips
the
whip
had
a
short
wooden
stock
braided
over
with
leather
and
was
loaded
at
the
butt
the
lash
was
three
feet
long
or
thereabouts
and
made
of
strands
at
first
i
was
somewhat
frightened
and
my
impulse
was
to
run
there
was
no
one
about
except
rachel
the
cook
and
chapin
wife
and
neither
of
them
were
to
be
seen
the
rest
were
in
the
field
i
knew
he
intended
to
whip
me
and
it
was
the
first
time
any
one
had
attempted
it
since
my
arrival
at
avoyelles
i
felt
moreover
that
i
had
been
faithful
that
i
was
guilty
of
no
wrong
whatever
and
deserved
commendation
rather
than
punishment
my
fear
changed
to
anger
and
before
he
reached
me
i
had
made
up
my
mind
fully
not
to
be
whipped
let
the
result
be
life
or
death
winding
the
lash
around
his
hand
and
taking
hold
of
the
small
end
of
the
stock
he
walked
up
to
me
and
with
a
malignant
look
ordered
me
to
strip
master
tibeats
said
i
looking
him
boldly
in
the
face
i
will
i
was
about
to
say
something
further
in
justification
but
with
concentrated
vengeance
he
sprang
upon
me
seizing
me
by
the
throat
with
one
hand
raising
the
whip
with
the
other
in
the
act
of
striking
before
the
blow
descended
however
i
had
caught
him
by
the
collar
of
the
coat
and
drawn
him
closely
to
me
reaching
down
i
seized
him
by
the
ankle
and
pushing
him
back
with
the
other
hand
he
fell
over
on
the
ground
putting
one
arm
around
his
leg
and
holding
it
to
my
breast
so
that
his
head
and
shoulders
only
touched
the
ground
i
placed
my
foot
upon
his
neck
he
was
completely
in
my
power
my
blood
was
up
it
seemed
to
course
through
my
veins
like
fire
in
the
frenzy
of
my
madness
i
snatched
the
whip
from
his
hand
he
struggled
with
all
his
power
swore
that
i
should
not
live
to
see
another
day
and
that
he
would
tear
out
my
heart
but
his
struggles
and
his
threats
were
alike
in
vain
i
can
not
tell
how
many
times
i
struck
him
blow
after
blow
fell
fast
and
heavy
upon
his
wriggling
form
at
length
he
screamed
cried
murder
and
at
last
the
blasphemous
tyrant
called
on
god
for
mercy
but
he
who
had
never
shown
mercy
did
not
receive
it
the
stiff
stock
of
the
whip
warped
round
his
cringing
body
until
my
right
arm
ached
until
this
time
i
had
been
too
busy
to
look
about
me
desisting
for
a
moment
i
saw
chapin
looking
from
the
window
and
rachel
standing
in
the
kitchen
door
their
attitudes
expressed
the
utmost
excitement
and
alarm
his
screams
had
been
heard
in
the
field
chapin
was
coming
as
fast
as
he
could
ride
i
struck
him
a
blow
or
two
more
then
pushed
him
from
me
with
such
a
kick
that
he
went
rolling
over
on
the
ground
rising
to
his
feet
and
brushing
the
dirt
from
his
hair
he
stood
looking
at
me
pale
with
rage
we
gazed
at
each
other
in
silence
not
a
word
was
uttered
until
chapin
galloped
up
to
us
what
is
the
matter
he
cried
out
master
tibeats
wants
to
whip
me
for
using
the
nails
you
gave
me
i
replied
what
is
the
matter
with
the
nails
he
inquired
turning
to
tibeats
tibeats
answered
to
the
effect
that
they
were
too
large
paying
little
heed
however
to
chapin
question
but
still
keeping
his
snakish
eyes
fastened
maliciously
on
me
i
am
overseer
here
chapin
began
i
told
platt
to
take
them
and
use
them
and
if
they
were
not
of
the
proper
size
i
would
get
others
on
returning
from
the
field
it
is
not
his
fault
besides
i
shall
furnish
such
nails
as
i
please
i
hope
you
will
understand
mr
tibeats
tibeats
made
no
reply
but
grinding
his
teeth
and
shaking
his
fist
swore
he
would
have
satisfaction
and
that
it
was
not
half
over
yet
thereupon
he
walked
away
followed
by
the
overseer
and
entered
the
house
the
latter
talking
to
him
all
the
while
in
a
suppressed
tone
and
with
earnest
gestures
i
remained
where
i
was
doubting
whether
it
was
better
to
fly
or
abide
the
result
whatever
it
might
be
presently
tibeats
came
out
of
the
house
and
saddling
his
horse
the
only
property
he
possessed
besides
myself
departed
on
the
road
to
cheneyville
when
he
was
gone
chapin
came
out
visibly
excited
telling
me
not
to
stir
not
to
attempt
to
leave
the
plantation
on
any
account
whatever
he
then
went
to
the
kitchen
and
calling
rachel
out
conversed
with
her
some
time
coming
back
he
again
charged
me
with
great
earnestness
not
to
run
saying
my
master
was
a
rascal
that
he
had
left
on
no
good
errand
and
that
there
might
be
trouble
before
night
but
at
all
events
he
insisted
upon
it
i
must
not
stir
as
i
stood
there
feelings
of
unutterable
agony
overwhelmed
me
i
was
conscious
that
i
had
subjected
myself
to
unimaginable
punishment
the
reaction
that
followed
my
extreme
ebullition
of
anger
produced
the
most
painful
sensations
of
regret
an
unfriended
helpless
slave
what
could
i
what
could
i
to
justify
in
the
remotest
manner
the
heinous
act
i
had
committed
of
resenting
a
contumely
and
abuse
i
tried
to
pray
i
tried
to
beseech
my
heavenly
father
to
sustain
me
in
my
sore
extremity
but
emotion
choked
my
utterance
and
i
could
only
bow
my
head
upon
my
hands
and
weep
for
at
least
an
hour
i
remained
in
this
situation
finding
relief
only
in
tears
when
looking
up
i
beheld
tibeats
accompanied
by
two
horsemen
coming
down
the
bayou
they
rode
into
the
yard
jumped
from
their
horses
and
approached
me
with
large
whips
one
of
them
also
carrying
a
coil
of
rope
cross
your
hands
commanded
tibeats
with
the
addition
of
such
a
shuddering
expression
of
blasphemy
as
is
not
decorous
to
repeat
you
need
not
bind
me
master
tibeats
i
am
ready
to
go
with
you
anywhere
said
i
one
of
his
companions
then
stepped
forward
swearing
if
i
made
the
least
resistance
he
would
break
my
head
he
would
tear
me
limb
from
limb
he
would
cut
my
black
throat
and
giving
wide
scope
to
other
similar
expressions
perceiving
any
importunity
altogether
vain
i
crossed
my
hands
submitting
humbly
to
whatever
disposition
they
might
please
to
make
of
me
thereupon
tibeats
tied
my
wrists
drawing
the
rope
around
them
with
his
utmost
strength
then
he
bound
my
ankles
in
the
same
manner
in
the
meantime
the
other
two
had
slipped
a
cord
within
my
elbows
running
it
across
my
back
and
tying
it
firmly
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
move
hand
or
foot
with
a
remaining
piece
of
rope
tibeats
made
an
awkward
noose
and
placed
it
about
my
neck
now
then
inquired
one
of
tibeats
companions
where
shall
we
hang
the
nigger
one
proposed
such
a
limb
extending
from
the
body
of
a
peach
tree
near
the
spot
where
we
were
standing
his
comrade
objected
to
it
alleging
it
would
break
and
proposed
another
finally
they
fixed
upon
the
latter
during
this
conversation
and
all
the
time
they
were
binding
me
i
uttered
not
a
word
overseer
chapin
during
the
progress
of
the
scene
was
walking
hastily
back
and
forth
on
the
piazza
rachel
was
crying
by
the
kitchen
door
and
chapin
was
still
looking
from
the
window
hope
died
within
my
heart
surely
my
time
had
come
i
should
never
behold
the
light
of
another
day
never
behold
the
faces
of
my
children
the
sweet
anticipation
i
had
cherished
with
such
fondness
i
should
that
hour
struggle
through
the
fearful
agonies
of
death
none
would
mourn
for
me
none
revenge
me
soon
my
form
would
be
mouldering
in
that
distant
soil
or
perhaps
be
cast
to
the
slimy
reptiles
that
filled
the
stagnant
waters
of
the
bayou
tears
flowed
down
my
cheeks
but
they
only
afforded
a
subject
of
insulting
comment
for
my
executioners

at

towards

chapin
who
had
momentarily
disappeared
from
the
piazza
came
out
of
the
house
and
walked
towards
us
he
had
a
pistol
in
each
hand
and
as
near
as
i
can
now
recall
to
mind
spoke
in
a
firm
determined
manner
as
follows
gentlemen
i
have
a
few
words
to
say
you
had
better
listen
to
them
whoever
moves
that
slave
another
foot
from
where
he
stands
is
a
dead
man
in
the
first
place
he
does
not
deserve
this
treatment
it
is
a
shame
to
murder
him
in
this
manner
i
never
knew
a
more
faithful
boy
than
platt
you
tibeats
are
in
the
fault
yourself
you
are
pretty
much
of
a
scoundrel
and
i
know
it
and
you
richly
deserve
the
flogging
you
have
received
in
the
next
place
i
have
been
overseer
on
this
plantation
seven
years

in
the
absence
of
william

master

my
duty
is

protect
his
interests
and

duty
i
shall
perform
you
are
not
responsible

are

him

there
is

begone

and
ramsay
without
a
further
word
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
away
tibeats
in
a
few
minutes
evidently
in
fear
and
overawed
by
the
decided
tone
of
chapin
sneaked
off
like
a
coward
as
he
was
and
mounting
his
horse
followed
his
companions
i
remained
standing
where
i
was
still
bound
with
the
rope
around
my
neck
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
chapin
called
rachel
ordering
her
to
run
to
the
field
and
tell
lawson
to
hurry
to
the
house
without
delay
and
bring
the
brown
mule
with
him
an
animal
much
prized
for
its
unusual
fleetness
presently
the
boy
appeared
lawson
said
chapin
you
must
go
to
the
pine
woods
tell
your
master
ford
to
come
here
at
once
that
he
must
not
delay
a
single
moment
tell
him
they
are

murder
platt
now
hurry
boy
be
at
the

by
noon
if
you
kill
the
mule
chapin
stepped
into
the
house
and
wrote
a
pass
when
he
returned
lawson
was
at
the
door

on
his

receiving
the
pass
he
plied
the
whip
right
smartly

the
beast

out

turning
up
the

on

hard

as

approached

that
day
it
became
insufferably
warm
its
hot
rays
scorched
the
ground
the
earth
almost
blistered
the
foot
that
stood
upon
it
i
was
without
coat
or
hat
standing
exposed
to
its
burning
blaze
great
drops
of
perspiration
rolled
down
my
face
drenching
the
scanty
apparel
wherewith
i
was
clothed
over
the
fence
a
very
little
way
off
the
peach
trees
cast
their
cool
delicious
shadows
on
the
grass
i
would
gladly
have
given
a
long
year
of
service
to
have
been
enabled
to
exchange
the
heated
oven
as
it
were
wherein
i
stood
for
a
seat
beneath
their
branches
but
i
was
yet
bound
the
rope
still
dangling
from
my
neck
and
standing
in
the
same
tracks
where
tibeats
and
his
comrades
left
me
i
could
not
move
an
inch
so
firmly
had
i
been
bound
to
have
been
enabled
to
lean
against
the
weaving
house
would
have
been
a
luxury
indeed
but
it
was
far
beyond
my
reach
though
distant
less
than
twenty
feet
i
wanted
to
lie
down
but
knew
i
could
not
rise
again
the
ground
was
so
parched
and
boiling
hot
i
was
aware
it
would
but
add
to
the
discomfort
of
my
situation
if
i
could
have
only
moved
my
position
however
slightly
it
would
have
been
relief
unspeakable
but
the
hot
rays
of
a
southern
sun
beating
all
the
long
summer
day
on
my
bare
head
produced
not
half
the
suffering
i
experienced
from
my
aching
limbs
my
wrists
and
ankles
and
the
cords
of
my
legs
and
arms
began
to
swell
burying
the
rope
that
bound
them
into
the
swollen
flesh
all
day
chapin
walked
back
and
forth
upon
the
stoop
but
not
once
approached
me
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
great
uneasiness
looking
first
towards
me
and
then
up
the
road
as
if
expecting
some
arrival
every
moment
he
did
not
go
to
the
field
as
was
his
custom
it
was
evident
from
his
manner
that
he
supposed
tibeats
would
return
with
more
and
better
armed
assistance
perhaps
to
renew
the
quarrel
and
it
was
equally
evident
he
had
prepared
his
mind
to
defend
my
life
at
whatever
hazard
why
he
did
not
relieve
me
why
he
suffered
me
to
remain
in
agony
the
whole
weary
day
i
never
knew
it
was
not
for
want
of
sympathy
i
am
certain
perhaps
he
wished
ford
to
see
the
rope
about
my
neck
and
the
brutal
manner
in
which
i
had
been
bound
perhaps
his
interference
with
another
property
in
which
he
had
no
legal
interest
might
have
been
a
trespass
which
would
have
subjected
him
to
the
penalty
of
the
law
why
tibeats
was
all
day
absent
was
another
mystery
i
never
could
divine
he
knew
well
enough
that
chapin
would
not
harm
him
unless
he
persisted
in
his
design
against
me
lawson
told
me
afterwards
that
as
he
passed
the
plantation
of
john
david
cheney
he
saw
the
three
and
that
they
turned
and
looked
after
him
as
he
flew
by
i
think
his
supposition
was
that
lawson
had
been
sent
out
by
overseer
chapin
to
arouse
the
neighboring
planters
and
to
call
on
them
to
come
to
his
assistance
he
therefore
undoubtedly
acted
on
the
principle
that
discretion
is
the
better
part
of
valor
and
kept
away
but
whatever
motive
may
have
governed
the
cowardly
and
malignant
tyrant
it
is
of
no
importance
there
i
still
stood
in
the
sun
groaning
with
pain
from
long
before
daylight
i
had
not
eaten
a
morsel
i
was
growing
faint
from
pain
and
thirst
and
hunger
once
only
in
the
very
hottest
portion
of
the
day
rachel
half
fearful
she
was
acting
contrary
to
the
overseer
wishes
ventured
to
me
and
held
a
cup
of
water
to
my
lips
the
humble
creature
never
knew
nor
could
she
comprehend
if
she
had
heard
them
the
blessings
i
invoked
upon
her
for
that
balmy
draught
she
could
only
say
oh
platt
how
i
do
pity
you
and
then
hastened
back
to
her
labors
in
the
kitchen
never
did
the
sun
move
so
slowly
through
the
heavens
never
did
it
shower
down
such
fervent
and
fiery
rays
as
it
did
that
day
at
least
so
it
appeared
to
me
what
my
meditations
were
the
innumerable
thoughts
that
thronged
through
my
distracted
brain
i
will
not
attempt
to
give
expression
to
suffice
it
to
say
during
the
whole
long
day
i
came
not
to
the
conclusion
even
once
that
the
southern
slave
fed
clothed
whipped
and
protected
by
his
master
is
happier
than
the
free
colored
citizen
of
the
north
to
that
conclusion
i
have
never
since
arrived
there
are
many
however
even
in
the
northern
states
benevolent
and
men
who
will
pronounce
my
opinion
erroneous
and
gravely
proceed
to
substantiate
the
assertion
with
an
argument
alas
they
have
never
drunk
as
i
have
from
the
bitter
cup
of
slavery
just
at
sunset
my
heart
leaped
with
unbounded
joy
as
ford
came
riding
into
the
yard
his
horse
covered
with
foam
chapin
met
him
at
the
door
and
after
conversing
a
short
time
he
walked
directly
to
me
poor
platt
you
are
in
a
bad
state
was
the
only
expression
that
escaped
his
lips
thank
god
said
i
thank
god
master
ford
that
you
have
come
at
last
drawing
a
knife
from
his
pocket
he
indignantly
cut
the
cord
from
my
wrists
arms
and
ankles
and
slipped
the
noose
from
my
neck
i
attempted
to
walk
but
staggered
like
a
drunken
man
and
fell
partially
to
the
ground
ford
returned
immediately
to
the
house
leaving
me
alone
again
as
he
reached
the
piazza
tibeats
and
his
two
friends
rode
up
a
long
dialogue
followed
i
could
hear
the
sound
of
their
voices
the
mild
tones
of
ford
mingling
with
the
angry
accents
of
tibeats
but
was
unable
to
distinguish
what
was
said
finally
the
three
departed
again
apparently
not
well
pleased
i
endeavored
to
raise
the
hammer
thinking
to
show
ford
how
willing
i
was
to
work
by
proceeding
with
my
labors
on
the
weaving
house
but
it
fell
from
my
nerveless
hand
at
dark
i
crawled
into
the
cabin
and
laid
down
i
was
in
great
misery
all
sore
and
swollen
the
slightest
movement
producing
excruciating
suffering
soon
the
hands
came
in
from
the
field
rachel
when
she
went
after
lawson
had
told
them
what
had
happened
eliza
and
mary
broiled
me
a
piece
of
bacon
but
my
appetite
was
gone
then
they
scorched
some
corn
meal
and
made
coffee
it
was
all
that
i
could
take
eliza
consoled
me
and
was
very
kind
it
was
not
long
before
the
cabin
was
full
of
slaves
they
gathered
round
me
asking
many
questions
about
the
difficulty
with
tibeats
in
the
morning
and
the
particulars
of
all
the
occurrences
of
the
day
then
rachel
came
in
and
in
her
simple
language
repeated
it
over
again
dwelling
emphatically
on
the
kick
that
sent
tibeats
rolling
over
on
the
ground
whereupon
there
was
a
general
titter
throughout
the
crowd
then
she
described
how
chapin
walked
out
with
his
pistols
and
rescued
me
and
how
master
ford
cut
the
ropes
with
his
knife
just
as
if
he
was
mad
by
this
time
lawson
had
returned
he
had
to
regale
them
with
an
account
of
his
trip
to
the
pine
woods
how
the
brown
mule
bore
him
faster
than
a
streak
how
he
astonished
everybody
as
he
flew
along
how
master
ford
started
right
away
how
he
said
platt
was
a
good
nigger
and
they
should
kill
him
concluding
with
pretty
strong
intimations
that
there
was
not
another
human
being
in
the
wide
world
who
could
have
created
such
a
universal
sensation
on
the
road
or
performed
such
a
marvelous
john
gilpin
feat
as
he
had
done
that
day
on
the
brown
mule
the
kind
creatures
loaded
me
with
the
expression
of
their
sympathy
saying
tibeats
was
a
hard
cruel
man
and
hoping
massa
ford
would
get
me
back
again
in
this
manner
they
passed
the
time
discussing
chatting
talking
over
and
over
again
the
exciting
affair
until
suddenly
chapin
presented
himself
at
the
cabin
door
and
called
me
platt
said
he
you
will
sleep
on
the
floor
in
the
great
house
bring
your
blanket
with
you
i
arose
as
quickly
as
i
was
able
took
my
blanket
in
my
hand
and
followed
him
on
the
way
he
informed
me
that
he
should
not
wonder
if
tibeats
was
back
again
before
morning
that
he
intended
to
kill
me
and
that
he
did
not
mean
he
should
do
it
without
witnesses
had
he
stabbed
me
to
the
heart
in
the
presence
of
a
hundred
slaves
not
one
of
them
by
the
laws
of
louisiana
could
have
given
evidence
against
him
i
laid
down
on
the
floor
in
the
great
house
the
first
and
the
last
time
such
a
sumptuous
resting
place
was
granted
me
during
my
twelve
years
of
bondage
and
tried
to
sleep
near
midnight
the
dog
began
to
bark
chapin
arose
looked
from
the
window
but
could
discover
nothing
at
length
the
dog
was
quiet
as
he
returned
to
his
room
he
said
i
believe
platt
that
scoundrel
is
skulking
about
the
premises
somewhere
if
the
dog
barks
again
and
i
am
sleeping
wake
me
i
promised
to
do
so
after
the
lapse
of
an
hour
or
more
the
dog
his
clamor
running
towards
the
gate
then
back
again
all
the
while
barking
furiously
chapin
was
out
of
bed
without
waiting
to
be
called
on
this
occasion
he
stepped
forth
upon
the
piazza
and
remained
standing
there
a
considerable
length
of
time
nothing
however
was
to
be
seen
and
the
dog
returned
to
his
kennel
we
were
not
disturbed
again
during
the
night
the
excessive
pain
that
i
suffered
and
the
dread
of
some
impending
danger
prevented
any
rest
whatever
whether
or
not
tibeats
did
actually
return
to
the
plantation
that
night
seeking
an
opportunity
to
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
me
is
a
secret
known
only
to
himself
perhaps
i
thought
then
however
and
have
the
strong
impression
still
that
he
was
there
at
all
events
he
had
the
disposition
of
an
assassin
cowering
before
a
brave
man
words
but
ready
to
strike
his
helpless
or
unsuspecting
victim
in
the
back
as
i
had
reason
afterwards
to
know
at
daylight
in
the
morning
i
arose
sore
and
weary
having
rested
little
nevertheless
after
partaking
breakfast
which
mary
and
eliza
had
prepared
for
me
in
the
cabin
i
proceeded
to
the
weaving
house
and
commenced
the
labors
of
another
day
it
was
chapin
practice
as
it
is
the
practice
of
overseers
generally
immediately
on
arising
to
bestride
his
horse
always
saddled
and
bridled
and
ready
for
him
the
particular
business
of
some
slave
and
ride
into
the
field
this
morning
on
the
contrary
he
came
to
the
weaving
house
asking
if
i
had
seen
anything
of
tibeats
yet
replying
in
the
negative
he
remarked
there
was
something
not
right
about
the
fellow
there
was
bad
blood
in
him
that
i
must
keep
a
sharp
watch
of
him
or
he
would
do
me
wrong
some
day
when
i
least
expected
it
while
he
was
yet
speaking
tibeats
rode
in
hitched
his
horse
and
entered
the
house
i
had
little
fear
of
him
while
ford
and
chapin
were
at
hand
but
they
could
not
be
near
me
always
oh
how
heavily
the
weight
of
slavery
pressed
upon
me
then
i
must
toil
day
after
day
endure
abuse
and
taunts
and
scoffs
sleep
on
the
hard
ground
live
on
the
coarsest
fare
and
not
only
this
but
live
the
slave
of
a
wretch
of
whom
i
must
stand
henceforth
in
continued
fear
and
dread
why
had
i
not
died
in
my
young
years
before
god
had
given
me
children
to
love
and
live
for
what
unhappiness
and
suffering
and
sorrow
it
would
have
prevented
i
sighed
for
liberty
but
the
bondman
chain
was
round
me
and
could
not
be
shaken
off
i
could
only
gaze
wistfully
towards
the
north
and
think
of
the
thousands
of
miles
that
stretched
between
me
and
the
soil
of
freedom
over
which
a
freeman
may
not
pass
tibeats
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
walked
over
to
the
looked
at
me
sharply
then
returned
without
saying
anything
most
of
the
forenoon
he
sat
on
the
piazza
reading
a
newspaper
and
conversing
with
ford
after
dinner
the
latter
left
for
the
pine
woods
and
it
was
indeed
with
regret
that
i
beheld
him
depart
from
the
plantation
once
more
during
the
day
tibeats
came
to
me
gave
me
some
order
and
returned
during
the
week
the
was
completed
tibeats
in
the
meantime
making
no
allusion
whatever
to
the
difficulty
when
i
was
informed
he
had
hired
me
to
peter
tanner
to
work
under
another
carpenter
by
the
name
of
myers
this
announcement
was
received
with
gratification
as
any
place
was
desirable
that
would
relieve
me
of
his
hateful
presence
peter
tanner
as
the
reader
has
already
been
informed
lived
on
the
opposite
shore
and
was
the
brother
of
mistress
ford
he
is
one
of
the
most
extensive
planters
on
bayou
boeuf
and
owns
a
large
number
of
slaves
over
i
went
to
tanner
joyfully
enough
he
had
heard
of
my
late
difficulties
in
fact
i
ascertained
the
flogging
of
tibeats
was
soon
blazoned
far
and
wide
this
affair
together
with
my
rafting
experiment
had
rendered
me
somewhat
notorious
more
than
once
i
heard
it
said
that
platt
ford
now
platt
tibeats
a
slave
name
changes
with
his
change
of
master
was
a
devil
of
a
nigger
but
i
was
destined
to
make
a
still
further
noise
as
will
presently
be
seen
throughout
the
little
world
of
bayou
boeuf
peter
tanner
endeavored
to
impress
upon
me
the
idea
that
he
was
quite
severe
though
i
could
perceive
there
was
a
vein
of
good
humor
in
the
old
fellow
after
all
you
the
nigger
he
said
to
me
on
my
arrival
you
the
nigger
that
flogged
your
master
eh
you
the
nigger
that
kicks
and
holds
carpenter
tibeats
by
the
leg
and
wallops
him
are
ye
i
like
to
see
you
hold
me
by
the
leg
i
should
you
a
character
a
great
nigger
very
remarkable
nigger
ai
ye
lash
you
take
the
tantrums
out
of
ye
jest
take
hold
of
my
leg
if
you
please
none
of
your
pranks
here
my
boy
remember
now
go
to
work
you
rascal
concluded
peter
tanner
unable
to
suppress
a
grin
at
his
own
wit
and
sarcasm
after
listening
to
this
salutation
i
was
taken
charge
of
by
myers
and
labored
under
his
direction
for
a
month
to
his
and
my
own
satisfaction
like
william
ford
his
tanner
was
in
the
habit
of
reading
the
bible
to
his
slaves
on
the
sabbath
but
in
a
somewhat
different
spirit
he
was
an
impressive
commentator
on
the
new
testament
the
first
sunday
after
my
coming
to
the
plantation
he
called
them
together
and
began
to
read
the
twelfth
chapter
of
luke
when
he
came
to
the
verse
he
looked
deliberately
around
him
and
continued
and
that
servant
which
knew
his
lord
here
he
paused
looking
around
more
deliberately
than
before
and
again
proceeded
which
knew
his
lord
and
not
himself
here
was
another
pause
not
himself
neither
did
to
his
will
shall
be
beaten
with
many
d
hear
that
demanded
peter
emphatically
he
repeated
slowly
and
distinctly
taking
off
his
spectacles
preparatory
to
making
a
few
remarks
that
nigger
that
do
take
care
that
do
obey
his
lord
his
master
d
see
that
nigger
shall
be
beaten
with
many
stripes
now
signifies
a
many
forty
a
hundred
a
hundred
and
fifty
lashes
scripter
and
so
peter
continued
to
elucidate
the
subject
for
a
great
length
of
time
much
to
the
edification
of
his
sable
audience
at
the
conclusion
of
the
exercises
calling
up
three
of
his
slaves
warner
will
and
major
he
cried
out
to
me
here
platt
you
held
tibeats
by
the
legs
now
i
see
if
you
can
hold
these
rascals
in
the
same
way
till
i
get
back
from
meetin
thereupon
he
ordered
them
to
the
stocks
a
common
thing
on
plantations
in
the
red
river
country
the
stocks
are
formed
of
two
planks
the
lower
one
made
fast
at
the
ends
to
two
short
posts
driven
firmly
into
the
ground
at
regular
distances
half
circles
are
cut
in
the
upper
edge
the
other
plank
is
fastened
to
one
of
the
posts
by
a
hinge
so
that
it
can
be
opened
or
shut
down
in
the
same
manner
as
the
blade
of
a
is
shut
or
opened
in
the
lower
edge
of
the
upper
plank
corresponding
half
circles
are
also
cut
so
that
when
they
close
a
row
of
holes
is
formed
large
enough
to
admit
a
leg
above
the
ankle
but
not
large
enough
to
enable
him
to
draw
out
his
foot
the
other
end
of
the
upper
plank
opposite
the
hinge
is
fastened
to
its
post
by
lock
and
key
the
slave
is
made
to
sit
upon
the
ground
when
the
uppermost
plank
is
elevated
his
legs
just
above
the
ankles
placed
in
the
circles
and
shutting
it
down
again
and
locking
it
he
is
held
secure
and
fast
very
often
the
neck
instead
of
the
ankle
is
enclosed
in
this
manner
they
are
held
during
the
operation
of
whipping
warner
will
and
major
according
to
tanner
account
of
them
were
niggers
and
not
approving
of
such
wickedness
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
put
them
in
the
stocks
handing
me
the
key
himself
myers
mistress
tanner
and
the
children
entered
the
carriage
and
drove
away
to
church
at
cheneyville
when
they
were
gone
the
boys
begged
me
to
let
them
out
i
felt
sorry
to
see
them
sitting
on
the
hot
ground
and
remembered
my
own
sufferings
in
the
sun
upon
their
promise
to
return
to
the
stocks
at
any
moment
they
were
required
to
do
so
i
consented
to
release
them
grateful
for
the
lenity
shown
them
and
in
order
in
some
measure
to
repay
it
they
could
do
no
less
of
course
than
pilot
me
to
the
shortly
before
tanner
return
they
were
in
the
stocks
again
finally
he
drove
up
and
looking
at
the
boys
said
with
a
chuckle
aha
ye
hav
been
strolling
about
much
any
way
teach
you
what
what
tire
ye
of
eating
on
the
lord
day
ye
niggers
peter
tanner
prided
himself
upon
his
strict
religious
observances
he
was
a
deacon
in
the
church
but
i
have
now
reached
a
point
in
the
progress
of
my
narrative
when
it
becomes
necessary
to
turn
away
from
these
light
descriptions
to
the
more
grave
and
weighty
matter
of
the
second
battle
with
master
tibeats
and
the
flight

the

arrival
at
ford
food
and
rest
at
the
end
of
a
month
my
services
being
no
longer
required
at
tanner
i
was
sent
over
the
bayou
again
to
my
master
whom
i
found
engaged
in
building
the
cotton
press
this
was
situated
at
some
distance
from
the
great
house
in
a
rather
retired
place
i
commenced
working
once
more
in
company
with
tibeats
being
entirely
alone
with
him
most
part
of
the
time
i
remembered
the
words
of
chapin
his
precautions
his
advice
to
beware
lest
in
some
unsuspecting
moment
he
might
injure
me
they
were
always
in
my
mind
so
that
i
lived
in
a
most
uneasy
state
of
apprehension
and
fear
one
eye
was
on
my
work
the
other
on
my
master
i
determined
to
give
him
no
cause
of
offence
to
work
still
more
diligently
if
possible
than
i
had
done
to
bear
whatever
abuse
he
might
heap
upon
me
save
bodily
injury
humbly
and
patiently
hoping
thereby
to
soften
in
some
degree
his
manner
towards
me
until
the
blessed
time
might
come
when
i
should
be
delivered
from
his
clutches
the
third
morning
after
my
return
chapin
left
the
plantation
for
cheneyville
to
be
absent
until
night
tibeats
on
that
morning
was
attacked
with
one
of
those
periodical
fits
of
spleen
and
to
which
he
was
frequently
subject
rendering
him
still
more
disagreeable
and
venomous
than
usual
it
was
about
nine
in
the
forenoon
when
i
was
busily
employed
with
the
on
one
of
the
sweeps
tibeats
was
standing
by
the
fitting
a
handle
into
the
chisel
with
which
he
had
been
engaged
previously
in
cutting
the
thread
of
the
screw
you
are
not
planing
that
down
enough
said
he
it
is
just
even
with
the
line
i
replied
you
a
d
d
liar
he
exclaimed
passionately
oh
well
master
i
said
mildly
i
will
plane
it
down
more
if
you
say
so
at
the
same
time
proceeding
to
do
as
i
supposed
he
desired
before
one
shaving
had
been
removed
however
he
cried
out
saying
i
had
now
planed
it
too
deep
it
was
too
small
i
had
spoiled
the
sweep
entirely
then
followed
curses
and
imprecations
i
had
endeavored
to
do
exactly
as
he
directed
but
nothing
would
satisfy
the
unreasonable
man
in
silence
and
in
dread
i
stood
by
the
sweep
holding
the
in
my
hand
not
knowing
what
to
do
and
not
daring
to
be
idle
his
anger
grew
more
and
more
violent
until
finally
with
an
oath
such
a
bitter
frightful
oath
as
only
tibeats
could
utter
he
seized
a
hatchet
from
the
and
darted
towards
me
swearing
he
would
cut
my
head
open
it
was
a
moment
of
life
or
death
the
sharp
bright
blade
of
the
hatchet
glittered
in
the
sun
in
another
instant
it
would
be
buried
in
my
brain
and
yet
in
that
instant
so
quick
will
a
man
thoughts
come
to
him
in
such
a
fearful
strait
i
reasoned
with
myself
if
i
stood
still
my
doom
was
certain
if
i
fled
ten
chances
to
one
the
hatchet
flying
from
his
hand
with
a
and
unerring
aim
would
strike
me
in
the
back
there
was
but
one
course
to
take
springing
towards
him
with
all
my
power
and
meeting
him
full
before
he
could
bring
down
the
blow
with
one
hand
i
caught
his
uplifted
arm
with
the
other
seized
him
by
the
throat
we
stood
looking
each
other
in
the
eyes
in
his
i
could
see
murder
i
felt
as
if
i
had
a
serpent
by
the
neck
watching
the
slightest
relaxation
of
my
gripe
to
coil
itself
round
my
body
crushing
and
stinging
it
to
death
i
thought
to
scream
aloud
trusting
that
some
ear
might
catch
the
sound
but
chapin
was
away
the
hands
were
in
the
field
there
was
no
living
soul
in
sight
or
hearing
the
good
genius
which
thus
far
through
life
has
saved
me
from
the
hands
of
violence
at
that
moment
suggested
a
lucky
thought
with
a
vigorous
and
sudden
kick
that
brought
him
on
one
knee
with
a
groan
i
released
my
hold
upon
his
throat
snatched
the
hatchet
and
cast
it
beyond
reach
frantic
with
rage
maddened
beyond
control
he
seized
a
white
oak
stick
five
feet
long
perhaps
and
as
large
in
circumference
as
his
hand
could
grasp
which
was
lying
on
the
ground
again
he
rushed
towards
me
and
again
i
met
him
seized
him
about
the
waist
and
being
the
stronger
of
the
two
bore
him
to
the
earth
while
in
that
position
i
obtained
possession
of
the
stick
and
rising
cast
it
from
me
also
he
likewise
arose
and
ran
for
the
on
the
fortunately
there
was
a
heavy
plank
lying
upon
its
broad
blade
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
not
extricate
it
before
i
had
sprung
upon
his
back
pressing
him
down
closely
and
heavily
on
the
plank
so
that
the
axe
was
held
more
firmly
to
its
place
i
endeavored
but
in
vain
to
break
his
grasp
upon
the
handle
in
that
position
we
remained
some
minutes
there
have
been
hours
in
my
unhappy
life
many
of
them
when
the
contemplation
of
death
as
the
end
of
earthly
sorrow
of
the
grave
as
a
resting
place
for
the
tired
and
worn
out
body
has
been
pleasant
to
dwell
upon
but
such
contemplations
vanish
in
the
hour
of
peril
no
man
in
his
full
strength
can
stand
undismayed
in
the
presence
of
the
king
of
terrors
life
is
dear
to
every
living
thing
the
worm
that
crawls
upon
the
ground
will
struggle
for
it
at
that
moment
it
was
dear
to
me
enslaved
and
treated
as
i
was
not
able
to
unloose
his
hand
once
more
i
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
this
time
with
a
gripe
that
soon
relaxed
his
hold
he
became
pliant
and
unstrung
his
face
that
had
been
white
with
passion
was
now
black
from
suffocation
those
small
serpent
eyes
that
spat
such
venom
were
now
full
of
horror
two
great
white
orbs
starting
from
their
sockets
there
was
a
lurking
devil
in
my
heart
that
prompted
me
to
kill
the
human
on
the
spot
to
retain
the
grip
on
his
accursed
throat
till
the
breath
of
life
was
gone
i
dared
not
murder
him
and
i
dared
not
let
him
live
if
i
killed
him
my
life
must
pay
the
forfeit
if
he
lived
my
life
only
would
satisfy
his
vengeance
a
voice
within
whispered
me
to
fly
to
be
a
wanderer
among
the
swamps
a
fugitive
and
a
vagabond
on
the
face
of
the
earth
was
preferable
to
the
life
that
i
was
leading
my
resolution
was
soon
formed
and
swinging
him
from
the
to
the
ground
i
leaped
a
fence
near
by
and
hurried
across
the
plantation
passing
the
slaves
at
work
in
the
cotton
field
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
i
reached
the
and
it
was
a
short
time
indeed
that
i
had
been
running
it
climbing
on
to
a
high
fence
i
could
see
the
cotton
press
the
great
house
and
the
space
between
it
was
a
conspicuous
position
from
whence
the
whole
plantation
was
in
view
i
saw
tibeats
cross
the
field
towards
the
house
and
enter
it
then
he
came
out
carrying
his
saddle
and
presently
mounted
his
horse
and
galloped
away
i
was
desolate
but
thankful
thankful
that
my
life
was
spared
desolate
and
discouraged
with
the
prospect
before
me
what
would
become
of
me
who
would
befriend
me
whither
should
i
fly
oh
god
thou
who
gavest
me
life
and
implanted
in
my
bosom
the
love
of
life
who
filled
it
with
emotions
such
as
other
men
thy
creatures
have
do
not
forsake
me
have
pity
on
the
poor
slave
let
me
not
perish
if
thou
dost
not
protect
me
i
am
lost
lost
such
supplications
silently
and
unuttered
ascended
from
my
inmost
heart
to
heaven
but
there
was
no
answering
voice
no
sweet
low
tone
coming
down
from
on
high
whispering
to
my
soul
it
is
i
be
not
afraid
i
was
the
forsaken
of
god
it
seemed
the
despised
and
hated
of
men
in
about
of
an
hour
several
of
the
slaves
shouted
and
made
signs
for
me
to
run
presently
looking
up
the
bayou
i
saw
tibeats
and
two
others
on
coming
at
a
fast
gait
followed
by
a
troop
of
dogs
there
were
as
many
as
eight
or
ten
distant
as
i
was
i
knew
them
they
belonged
on
the
adjoining
plantation
the
dogs
used
on
bayou
boeuf
for
hunting
slaves
are
a
kind
of
but
a
far
more
savage
breed
than
is
found
in
the
northern
states
they
will
attack
a
negro
at
their
master
bidding
and
cling
to
him
as
the
common
will
cling
to
a
four
footed
animal
frequently
their
loud
bay
is
heard
in
the
swamps
and
then
there
is
speculation
as
to
what
point
the
runaway
will
be
overhauled
the
same
as
a
hunter
stops
to
listen
to
the
hounds
coursing
along
the
hillsides
and
suggests
to
his
companion
that
the
fox
will
be
taken
at
such
a
place
i
never
knew
a
slave
escaping
with
his
life
from
bayou
boeuf
one
reason
is
they
are
not
allowed
to
learn
the
art
of
swimming
and
are
incapable
of
crossing
the
most
inconsiderable
stream
in
their
flight
they
can
go
in
no
direction
but
a
little
way
without
coming
to
a
bayou
when
the
inevitable
alternative
is
presented
of
being
drowned
or
overtaken
by
the
dogs
in
youth
i
had
practised
in
the
clear
streams
that
flow
through
my
native
district
until
i
had
become
an
expert
swimmer
and
felt
at
home
in
the
watery
element
i
stood
upon
the
fence
until
the
dogs
had
reached
the
cotton
press
in
an
instant
more
their
long
savage
yells
announced
they
were
on
my
track
leaping
down
from
my
position
i
ran
towards
the
swamp
fear
gave
me
strength
and
i
exerted
it
to
the
utmost
every
few
moments
i
could
hear
the
yelpings
of
the
dogs
they
were
gaining
upon
me
every
howl
was
nearer
and
nearer
each
moment
i
expected
they
would
spring
upon
my
back
expected
to
feel
their
long
teeth
sinking
into
my
flesh
there
were
so
many
of
them
i
knew
they
would
tear
me
to
pieces
that
they
would
worry
me
at
once
to
death
i
gasped
for
breath
gasped
forth
a
choking
prayer
to
the
almighty
to
save
me
to
give
me
strength
to
reach
some
wide
deep
bayou
where
i
could
throw
them
off
the
track
or
sink
into
its
waters
presently
i
reached
a
thick
palmetto
bottom
as
i
fled
through
them
they
made
a
loud
rustling
noise
not
loud
enough
however
to
drown
the
voices
of
the
dogs
continuing
my
course
due
south
as
nearly
as
i
can
judge
i
came
at
length
to
water
just
over
shoe
the
hounds
at
that
moment
could
not
have
been
five
rods
behind
me
i
could
hear
them
crashing
and
plunging
through
the
palmettoes
their
loud
eager
yells
making
the
whole
swamp
clamorous
with
the
sound
hope
revived
a
little
as
i
reached
the
water
if
it
were
only
deeper
they
might
lose
the
scent
and
thus
disconcerted
afford
me
the
opportunity
of
evading
them
luckily
it
grew
deeper
the
farther
i
proceeded
now
over
my
ankles
now
to
my
knees
now
sinking
a
moment
to
my
waist
and
then
emerging
presently
into
more
shallow
places
the
dogs
had
not
gained
upon
me
since
i
struck
the
water
evidently
they
were
confused
now
their
savage
intonations
grew
more
and
more
distant
assuring
me
that
i
was
leaving
them
finally
i
stopped
to
listen
but
the
long
howl
came
booming
on
the
air
again
telling
me
i
was
not
yet
safe
from
bog
to
bog
where
i
had
stepped
they
could
still
keep
upon
the
track
though
impeded
by
the
water
at
length
to
my
great
joy
i
came
to
a
wide
bayou
and
plunging
in
had
soon
stemmed
its
sluggish
current
to
the
other
side
there
certainly
the
dogs
would
be
confounded
the
current
carrying
down
the
stream
all
traces
of
that
slight
mysterious
scent
which
enables
the
hound
to
follow
in
the
track
of
the
fugitive
after
crossing
this
bayou
the
water
became
so
deep
i
could
not
run
i
was
now
in
what
i
afterwards
learned
was
the
great
pacoudrie
swamp
it
was
filled
with
immense
trees
the
sycamore
the
gum
the
cotton
wood
and
cypress
and
extends
i
am
informed
to
the
shore
of
the
calcasieu
river
for
thirty
or
forty
miles
it
is
without
inhabitants
save
wild
beasts
the
bear
the
the
tiger
and
great
slimy
reptiles
that
are
crawling
through
it
everywhere
long
before
i
reached
the
bayou
in
fact
from
the
time
i
struck
the
water
until
i
emerged
from
the
swamp
on
my
return
these
reptiles
surrounded
me
i
saw
hundreds
of
moccasin
snakes
every
log
and
bog
every
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
over
which
i
was
compelled
to
step
or
climb
was
alive
with
them
they
crawled
away
at
my
approach
but
sometimes
in
my
haste
i
almost
placed
my
hand
or
foot
upon
them
they
are
poisonous
serpents
their
bite
more
fatal
than
the
rattlesnake
besides
i
had
lost
one
shoe
the
sole
having
come
entirely
off
leaving
the
upper
only
dangling
to
my
ankle
i
saw
also
many
alligators
great
and
small
lying
in
the
water
or
on
pieces
of
floodwood
the
noise
i
made
usually
startled
them
when
they
moved
off
and
plunged
into
the
deepest
places
sometimes
however
i
would
come
directly
upon
a
monster
before
observing
it
in
such
cases
i
would
start
back
run
a
short
way
round
and
in
that
manner
shun
them
straight
forward
they
will
run
a
short
distance
rapidly
but
do
not
possess
the
power
of
turning
in
a
crooked
race
there
is
no
difficulty
in
evading
them
about
two
in
the
afternoon
i
heard
the
last
of
the
hounds
probably
they
did
not
cross
the
bayou
wet
and
weary
but
relieved
from
the
sense
of
instant
peril
i
continued
on
more
cautious
and
afraid
however
of
the
snakes
and
alligators
than
i
had
been
in
the
earlier
portion
of
my
flight
now
before
stepping
into
a
muddy
pool
i
would
strike
the
water
with
a
stick
if
the
waters
moved
i
would
go
around
it
if
not
would
venture
through
at
length
the
sun
went
down
and
gradually
night
trailing
mantle
shrouded
the
great
swamp
in
darkness
still
i
staggered
on
fearing
every
instant
i
should
feel
the
dreadful
sting
of
the
moccasin
or
be
crushed
within
the
jaws
of
some
disturbed
alligator
the
dread
of
them
now
almost
equaled
the
fear
of
the
pursuing
hounds
the
moon
arose
after
a
time
its
mild
light
creeping
through
the
overspreading
branches
loaded
with
long
pendent
moss
i
kept
traveling
forwards
until
after
midnight
hoping
all
the
while
that
i
would
soon
emerge
into
some
less
desolate
and
dangerous
region
but
the
water
grew
deeper
and
the
walking
more
difficult
than
ever
i
perceived
it
would
be
impossible
to
proceed
much
farther
and
knew
not
moreover
what
hands
i
might
fall
into
should
i
succeed
in
reaching
a
human
habitation
not
provided
with
a
pass
any
white
man
would
be
at
liberty
to
arrest
me
and
place
me
in
prison
until
such
time
as
my
master
should
prove
property
pay
charges
and
take
me
away
i
was
an
estray
and
if
so
unfortunate
as
to
meet
a
citizen
of
louisiana
he
would
deem
it
his
duty
to
his
neighbor
perhaps
to
put
me
forthwith
in
the
pound
really
it
was
difficult
to
determine
which
i
had
most
reason
to
fear
dogs
alligators
or
men
after
midnight
however
i
came
to
a
halt
imagination
can
not
picture
the
dreariness
of
the
scene
the
swamp
was
resonant
with
the
quacking
of
innumerable
ducks
since
the
foundation
of
the
earth
in
all
probability
a
human
footstep
had
never
before
so
far
penetrated
the
recesses
of
the
swamp
it
was
not
silent
now
silent
to
a
degree
that
rendered
it
oppressive
as
it
was
when
the
sun
was
shining
in
the
heavens
my
midnight
intrusion
had
awakened
the
feathered
tribes
which
seemed
to
throng
the
morass
in
hundreds
of
thousands
and
their
garrulous
throats
poured
forth
such
multitudinous
sounds
there
was
such
a
fluttering
of
wings
such
sullen
plunges
in
the
water
all
around
me
that
i
was
affrighted
and
appalled
all
the
fowls
of
the
air
and
all
the
creeping
things
of
the
earth
appeared
to
have
assembled
together
in
that
particular
place
for
the
purpose
of
filling
it
with
clamor
and
confusion
not
by
human
dwellings
not
in
crowded
cities
alone
are
the
sights
and
sounds
of
life
the
wildest
places
of
the
earth
are
full
of
them
even
in
the
heart
of
that
dismal
swamp
god
had
provided
a
refuge
and
a
dwelling
place
for
millions
of
living
things
the
moon
had
now
risen
above
the
trees
when
i
resolved
upon
a
new
project
thus
far
i
had
endeavored
to
travel
as
nearly
south
as
possible
turning
about
i
proceeded
in
a
direction
my
object
being
to
strike
the
pine
woods
in
the
vicinity
of
master
ford
once
within
the
shadow
of
his
protection
i
felt
i
would
be
comparatively
safe
my
clothes
were
in
tatters
my
hands
face
and
body
covered
with
scratches
received
from
the
sharp
knots
of
fallen
trees
and
in
climbing
over
piles
of
brush
and
floodwood
my
bare
foot
was
full
of
thorns
i
was
besmeared
with
muck
and
mud
and
the
green
slime
that
had
collected
on
the
surface
of
the
dead
water
in
which
i
had
been
immersed
to
the
neck
many
times
during
the
day
and
night
hour
after
hour
and
tiresome
indeed
had
they
become
i
continued
to
plod
along
on
my
course
the
water
began
to
grow
less
deep
and
the
ground
more
firm
under
my
feet
at
last
i
reached
the
pacoudrie
the
same
wide
bayou
i
had
swam
while
outward
bound
i
swam
it
again
and
shortly
after
thought
i
heard
a
cock
crow
but
the
sound
was
faint
and
it
might
have
been
a
mockery
of
the
ear
the
water
receded
from
my
advancing
footsteps
now
i
had
left
the
bogs
behind
me
now
i
was
on
dry
land
that
gradually
ascended
to
the
plain
and
i
knew
i
was
somewhere
in
the
great
pine
woods
just
at
i
came
to
an
opening
a
sort
of
small
plantation
but
one
i
had
never
seen
before
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
i
came
upon
two
men
a
slave
and
his
young
master
engaged
in
catching
wild
hogs
the
white
man
i
knew
would
demand
my
pass
and
not
able
to
give
him
one
would
take
me
into
possession
i
was
too
wearied
to
run
again
and
too
desperate
to
be
taken
and
therefore
adopted
a
ruse
that
proved
entirely
successful
assuming
a
fierce
expression
i
walked
directly
towards
him
looking
him
steadily
in
the
face
as
i
approached
he
moved
backwards
with
an
air
of
alarm
it
was
plain
he
was
much
affrighted
that
he
looked
upon
me
as
some
infernal
goblin
just
arisen
from
the
bowels
of
the
swamp
where
does
william
ford
live
i
demanded
in
no
gentle
tone
he
lives
seven
miles
from
here
was
the
reply
which
is
the
way
to
his
place
i
again
demanded
trying
to
look
more
fiercely
than
ever
do
you
see
those
pine
trees
yonder
he
asked
pointing
to
two
a
mile
distant
that
rose
far
above
their
fellows
like
a
couple
of
tall
sentinels
overlooking
the
broad
expanse
of
forest
i
see
them
was
the
answer
at
the
feet
of
those
pine
trees
he
continued
runs
the
texas
road
turn
to
the
left
and
it
will
lead
you
to
william
ford
without
farther
parley
i
hastened
forward
happy
as
he
was
no
doubt
to
place
the
widest
possible
distance
between
us
striking
the
texas
road
i
turned
to
the
left
hand
as
directed
and
soon
passed
a
great
fire
where
a
pile
of
logs
were
burning
i
went
to
it
thinking
i
would
dry
my
clothes
but
the
gray
light
of
the
morning
was
fast
breaking
away
some
passing
white
man
might
observe
me
besides
the
heat
overpowered
me
with
the
desire
of
sleep
so
lingering
no
longer
i
continued
my
travels
and
finally
about
eight
reached
the
house
of
master
ford
the
slaves
were
all
absent
from
the
quarters
at
their
work
stepping
on
to
the
piazza
i
knocked
at
the
door
which
was
soon
opened
by
mistress
ford
my
appearance
was
so
changed
i
was
in
such
a
wobegone
and
forlorn
condition
she
did
not
know
me
inquiring
if
master
ford
was
at
home
that
good
man
made
his
appearance
before
the
question
could
be
answered
i
told
him
of
my
flight
and
all
the
particulars
connected
with
it
he
listened
attentively
and
when
i
had
concluded
spoke
to
me
kindly
and
sympathetically
and
taking
me
to
the
kitchen
called
john
and
ordered
him
to
prepare
me
food
i
had
tasted
nothing
since
daylight
the
previous
morning
when
john
had
set
the
meal
before
me
the
madam
came
out
with
a
bowl
of
milk
and
many
little
delicious
dainties
such
as
rarely
please
the
palate
of
a
slave
i
was
hungry
and
i
was
weary
but
neither
food
nor
rest
afforded
half
the
pleasure
as
did
the
blessed
voices
speaking
kindness
and
consolation
it
was
the
oil
and
the
wine
which
the
good
samaritan
in
the
great
pine
woods
was
ready
to
pour
into
the
wounded
spirit
of
the
slave
who
came
to
him
stripped
of
his
raiment
and
they
left
me
in
the
cabin
that
i
might
rest
blessed
be
sleep
it
visiteth
all
alike
descending
as
the
dews
of
heaven
on
the
bond
and
free
soon
it
nestled
to
my
bosom
driving
away
the
troubles
that
oppressed
it
and
bearing
me
to
that
shadowy
region
where
i
saw
again
the
faces
and
listened
to
the
voices
of
my
children
who
alas
for
aught
i
knew
in
my
waking
hours
had
fallen
into
the
arms
of
that
sleep

which
they

i

and

cooked

some

sally

as

one

ill
and
she
feared

could
not
survive
dinner
over
after
walking
about
the
quarters
for
a
while
visiting
sally
cabin
and
looking
at
the
sick
child
i
strolled
into
the
madam
garden
though
it
was
a
season
of
the
year
when
the
voices
of
the
birds
are
silent
and
the
trees
are
stripped
of
their
summer
glories
in
more
frigid
climes
yet
the
whole
variety
of
roses
were
then
blooming
there
and
the
long
luxuriant
vines
creeping
over
the
frames
the
crimson
and
golden
fruit
hung
half
hidden
amidst
the
younger
and
older
blossoms
of
the
peach
the
orange
the
plum
and
the
pomegranate
for
in
that
region
of
almost
perpetual
warmth
the
leaves
are
falling
and
the
buds
bursting
into
bloom
the
whole
year
long
i
indulged
the
most
grateful
feelings
towards
master
and
mistress
ford
and
wishing
in
some
manner
to
repay
their
kindness
commenced
trimming
the
vines
and
afterwards
weeding
out
the
grass
from
among
the
orange
and
pomegranate
trees
the
latter
grows
eight
or
ten
feet
high
and
its
fruit
though
larger
is
similar
in
appearance
to
the
it
has
the
luscious
flavor
of
the
strawberry
oranges
peaches
plums
and
most
other
fruits
are
indigenous
to
the
rich
warm
soil
of
avoyelles
but
the
apple
the
most
common
of
them
all
in
colder
latitudes
is
rarely
to
be
seen
mistress
ford
came
out
presently
saying
it
was
in
me
but
i
was
not
in
a
condition
to
labor
and
might
rest
myself
at
the
quarters
until
master
should
go
down
to
bayou
boeuf
which
would
not
be
that
day
and
it
might
not
be
the
next
i
said
to
her
to
be
sure
i
felt
bad
and
was
stiff
and
that
my
foot
pained
me
the
stubs
and
thorns
having
so
torn
it
but
thought
such
exercise
would
not
hurt
me
and
that
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
work
for
so
good
a
mistress
thereupon
she
returned
to
the
great
house
and
for
three
days
i
was
diligent
in
the
garden
cleaning
the
walks
weeding
the
flower
beds
and
pulling
up
the
rank
grass
beneath
the
jessamine
vines
which
the
gentle
and
generous
hand
of
my
protectress
had
taught
to
clamber
along
the
walls
the
fourth
morning
having
become
recruited
and
refreshed
master
ford
ordered
me
to
make
ready
to
accompany
him
to
the
bayou
there
was
but
one
saddle
horse
at
the
opening
all
the
others
with
the
mules
having
been
sent
down
to
the
plantation
i
said
i
could
walk
and
bidding
sally
and
john
goodbye
left
the
opening
trotting
along
by
the
horse
side
that
little
paradise
in
the
great
pine
woods
was
the
oasis
in
the
desert
towards
which
my
heart
turned
lovingly
during
many
years
of
bondage
i
went
forth
from
it
now
with
regret
and
sorrow
not
so
overwhelming
however
as
if
it
had
then
been
given
me
to
know
that
i
should
never
return
to
it
again
master
ford
urged
me
to
take
his
place
occasionally
on
the
horse
to
rest
me
but
i
said
no
i
was
not
tired
and
it
was
better
for
me
to
walk
than
him
he
said
many
kind
and
cheering
things
to
me
on
the
way
riding
slowly
in
order
that
i
might
keep
pace
with
him
the
goodness
of
god
was
manifest
he
declared
in
my
miraculous
escape
from
the
swamp
as
daniel
came
forth
unharmed
from
the
den
of
lions
and
as
jonah
had
been
preserved
in
the
whale
belly
even
so
had
i
been
delivered
from
evil
by
the
almighty
he
interrogated
me
in
regard
to
the
various
fears
and
emotions
i
had
experienced
during
the
day
and
night
and
if
i
had
felt
at
any
time
a
desire
to
pray
i
felt
forsaken
of
the
whole
world
i
answered
him
and
was
praying
mentally
all
the
while
at
such
times
said
he
the
heart
of
man
turns
instinctively
towards
his
maker
in
prosperity
and
when
there
is
nothing
to
injure
or
make
him
afraid
he
remembers
him
not
and
is
ready
to
defy
him
but
place
him
in
the
midst
of
dangers
cut
him
off
from
human
aid
let
the
grave
open
before
him
then
it
is
in
the
time
of
his
tribulation
that
the
scoffer
and
unbelieving
man
turns
to
god
for
help
feeling
there
is
no
other
hope
or
refuge
or
safety
save
in
his
protecting
arm
so
did
that
benignant
man
speak
to
me
of
this
life
and
of
the
life
hereafter
of
the
goodness
and
power
of
god
and
of
the
vanity
of
earthly
things
as
we
journeyed
along
the
solitary
road
towards
bayou
boeuf
when
within
some
five
miles
of
the
plantation
we
discovered
a
horseman
at
a
distance
galloping
towards
us
as
he
came
near
i
saw
that
it
was
tibeats
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
but
did
not
address
me
and
turning
about
rode
along
side
by
side
with
ford
i
trotted
silently
at
their
horses
heels
listening
to
their
conversation
ford
informed
him
of
my
arrival
in
the
pine
woods
three
days
before
of
the
sad
plight
i
was
in
and
of
the
difficulties
and
dangers
i
had
encountered
well
exclaimed
tibeats
omitting
his
usual
oaths
in
the
presence
of
ford
i
never
saw
such
running
before
i
bet
him
against
a
hundred
dollars
he
beat
any
nigger
in
louisiana
i
offered
john
david
cheney
dollars
to
catch
him
dead
or
alive
but
he
outran
his
dogs
in
a
fair
race
them
cheney
dogs
ai
much
after
all
dunwoodie
hounds
would
have
had
him
down
before
he
touched
the
palmettoes
somehow
the
dogs
got
off
the
track
and
we
had
to
give
up
the
hunt
we
rode
the
horses
as
far
as
we
could
and
then
kept
on
foot
till
the
water
was
three
feet
deep
the
boys
said
he
was
drowned
sure
i
allow
i
wanted
a
shot
at
him
mightily
ever
since
i
have
been
riding
up
and
down
the
bayou
but
much
hope
of
catching
him
thought
he
was
dead
oh
he
a
cuss
to
run
that
nigger
is
in
this
way
tibeats
ran
on
describing
his
search
in
the
swamp
the
wonderful
speed
with
which
i
had
fled
before
the
hounds
and
when
he
had
finished
master
ford
responded
by
saying
i
had
always
been
a
willing
and
faithful
boy
with
him
that
he
was
sorry
we
had
such
trouble
that
according
to
platt
story
he
had
been
inhumanly
treated
and
that
he
tibeats
was
himself
in
fault
using
hatchets
and
upon
slaves
was
shameful
and
should
not
be
allowed
he
remarked
this
is
no
way
of
dealing
with
them
when
first
brought
into
the
country
it
will
have
a
pernicious
influence
and
set
them
all
running
away
the
swamps
will
be
full
of
them
a
little
kindness
would
be
far
more
effectual
in
restraining
them
and
rendering
them
obedient
than
the
use
of
such
deadly
weapons
every
planter
on
the
bayou
should
frown
upon
such
inhumanity
it
is
for
the
interest
of
all
to
do
so
it
is
evident
enough
tibeats
that
you
and
platt
can
not
live
together
you
dislike
him
and
would
not
hesitate
to
kill
him
and
knowing
it
he
will
run
from
you
again
through
fear
of
his
life
now
tibeats
you
must
sell
him
or
hire
him
out
at
least
unless
you
do
so
i
shall
take
measures
to
get
him
out
of
your
possession
in
this
spirit
ford
addressed
him
the
remainder
of
the
distance
i
opened
not
my
mouth
on
reaching
the
plantation
they
entered
the
great
house
while
i
repaired
to
eliza
cabin
the
slaves
were
astonished
to
find
me
there
on
returning
from
the
field
supposing
i
was
drowned
that
night
again
they
gathered
about
the
cabin
to
listen
to
the
story
of
my
adventure
they
took
it
for
granted
i
would
be
whipped
and
that
it
would
be
severe
the
penalty
of
running
away
being
five
hundred
lashes
poor
fellow
said
eliza
taking
me
by
the
hand
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
if
you
had
drowned
you
have
a
cruel
master
and
he
will
kill
you
yet
i
am
afraid
lawson
suggested
that
it
might
be
overseer
chapin
would
be
appointed
to
inflict
the
punishment
in
which
case
it
would
not
be
severe
whereupon
mary
rachel
bristol
and
others
hoped
it
would
be
master
ford
and
then
it
would
be
no
whipping
at
all
they
all
pitied
me
and
tried
to
console
me
and
were
sad
in
view
of
the
castigation
that
awaited
me
except
kentucky
john
there
were
no
bounds
to
his
laughter
he
filled
the
cabin
with
cachinnations
holding
his
sides
to
prevent
an
explosion
and
the
cause
of
his
noisy
mirth
was
the
idea
of
my
outstripping
the
hounds
somehow
he
looked
at
the
subject
in
a
comical
light
i
dey
cotch
him
when
he
run
cross
de
plantation
o
de
lor
platt
pick
his
feet
right
up
tho
hey
when
dem
dogs
got
whar
he
was
he
haw
haw
haw
o

a

and
then
kentucky
john
relapsed
into
another
of
his
boisterous
fits
early
the
next
morning
tibeats
left
the
plantation
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
while
sauntering
about
the
a
tall
man
came
to
me
and
inquired
if
i
was
tibeats
boy
that
youthful
appellation
being
applied
indiscriminately
to
slaves
even
though
they
may
have
passed
the
number
of
three
score
years
and
ten
i
took
off
my
hat
and
answered
that
i
was
how
would
you
like
to
work
for
me
he
inquired
oh
i
would
like
to
very
much
said
i
inspired
with
a
sudden
hope
of
getting
away
from
tibeats
you
worked
under
myers
at
peter
tanner
did
you
i
replied
i
had
adding
some
complimentary
remarks
that
myers
had
made
concerning
me
well
boy
said
he
i
have
hired
you
of
your
master
to
work
for
me
in
the
big
cane
brake
miles
from
here
down
on
red
river
this
man
was
eldret
who
lived
below
ford
on
the
same
side
of
the
bayou
i
accompanied
him
to
his
plantation
and
in
the
morning
started
with
his
slave
sam
and
a
of
provisions
drawn
by
four
mules
for
the
big
cane
eldret
and
myers
having
preceded
us
on
horseback
this
sam
was
a
native
of
charleston
where
he
had
a
mother
brother
and
sisters
he
allowed
a
common
word
among
both
black
and
white
that
tibeats
was
a
mean
man
and
hoped
as
i
most
earnestly
did
also
that
his
master
would
buy
me
we
proceeded
down
the
south
shore
of
the
bayou
crossing
it
at
plantation
from
thence
to
huff
power
passing
which
we
came
upon
the
bayou
rouge
road
which
runs
towards
red
river
after
passing
through
bayou
rouge
swamp
and
just
at
sunset
turning
from
the
highway
we
struck
off
into
the
big
cane
brake
we
followed
an
unbeaten
track
scarcely
wide
enough
to
admit
the
wagon
the
cane
such
as
are
used
for
were
as
thick
as
they
could
stand
a
person
could
not
be
seen
through
them
the
distance
of
a
rod
the
paths
of
wild
beasts
run
through
them
in
various
directions
the
bear
and
the
american
tiger
abounding
in
these
brakes
and
wherever
there
is
a
basin
of
stagnant
water
it
is
full
of
alligators
we
kept
on
our
lonely
course
through
the
big
cane
several
miles
when
we
entered
a
clearing
known
as
sutton
field
many
years
before
a
man
by
the
name
of
sutton
had
penetrated
the
wilderness
of
cane
to
this
solitary
place
tradition
has
it
that
he
fled
thither
a
fugitive
not
from
service
but
from
justice
here
he
lived
alone
recluse
and
hermit
of
the
swamp
with
his
own
hands
planting
the
seed
and
gathering
in
the
harvest
one
day
a
band
of
indians
stole
upon
his
solitude
and
after
a
bloody
battle
overpowered
and
massacred
him
for
miles
the
country
round
in
the
slaves
quarters
and
on
the
piazzas
of
great
houses
where
white
children
listen
to
superstitious
tales
the
story
goes
that
that
spot
in
the
heart
of
the
big
cane
is
a
haunted
place
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
human
voices
had
rarely
if
ever
disturbed
the
silence
of
the
clearing
rank
and
noxious
weeds
had
overspread
the
once
cultivated
field
serpents
sunned
themselves
on
the
doorway
of
the
crumbling
cabin
it
was
indeed
a
dreary
picture
of
desolation
passing
sutton
field
we
followed
a
road
two
miles
farther
which
brought
us
to
its
termination
we
had
now
reached
the
wild
lands
of
eldret
where
he
contemplated
clearing
up
an
extensive
plantation
we
went
to
work
next
morning
with
our
and
cleared
a
sufficient
space
to
allow
the
erection
of
two
cabins
one
for
myers
and
eldret
the
other
for
sam
myself
and
the
slaves
that
were
to
join
us
we
were
now
in
the
midst
of
trees
of
enormous
growth
whose
branches
almost
shut
out
the
light
of
the
sun
while
the
space
between
the
trunks
was
an
impervious
mass
of
cane
with
here
and
there
an
occasional
palmetto
the
bay
and
the
sycamore
the
oak
and
the
cypress
reach
a
growth
unparalleled
in
those
fertile
lowlands
bordering
the
red
river
from
every
tree
moreover
hang
long
large
masses
of
moss
presenting
to
the
eye
unaccustomed
to
them
a
striking
and
singular
appearance
this
moss
in
large
quantities
is
sent
north
and
there
used
for
manufacturing
purposes
we
cut
down
oaks
split
them
into
rails
and
with
these
erected
temporary
cabins
we
covered
the
roofs
with
the
broad
palmetto
leaf
an
excellent
substitute
for
shingles
as
long
as
they
last
the
greatest
annoyance
i
met
with
here
were
small
flies
gnats
and
mosquitoes
they
swarmed
the
air
they
penetrated
the
porches
of
the
ear
the
nose
the
eyes
the
mouth
they
sucked
themselves
beneath
the
skin
it
was
impossible
to
brush
or
beat
them
off
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
they
would
devour
us
carry
us
away
piecemeal
in
their
small
tormenting
mouths
a
lonelier
spot
or
one
more
disagreeable
than
the
centre
of
the
big
cane
brake
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
yet
to
me
it
was
a
paradise
in
comparison
with
any
other
place
in
the
company
of
master
tibeats
i
labored
hard
and
was
weary
and
fatigued
yet
i
could
lie
down
at
night
in
peace
and
arise
in
the
morning
without
fear
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
four
black
girls
came
down
from
plantation
charlotte
fanny
cresia
and
nelly
they
were
all
large
and
stout
axes
were
put
into
their
hands
and
they
were
sent
out
with
sam
and
myself
to
cut
trees
they
were
excellent
choppers
the
largest
oak
or
sycamore
standing
but
a
brief
season
before
their
heavy
and
blows
at
piling
logs
they
were
equal
to
any
man
there
are
lumberwomen
as
well
as
lumbermen
in
the
forests
of
the
south
in
fact
in
the
region
of
the
bayou
boeuf
they
perform
their
share
of
all
the
labor
required
on
the
plantation
they
plough
drag
drive
team
clear
wild
lands
work
on
the
highway
and
so
forth
some
planters
owning
large
cotton
and
sugar
plantations
have
none
other
than
the
labor
of
slave
women
such
a
one
is
jim
burns
who
lives
on
the
north
shore
of
the
bayou
opposite
the
plantation
of
john
fogaman
on
our
arrival
in
the
brake
eldret
promised
me
if
i
worked
well
i
might
go
up
to
visit
my
friends
at
ford
in
four
weeks
on
saturday
night
of
the
fifth
week
i
reminded
him
of
his
promise
when
he
told
me
i
had
done
so
well
that
i
might
go
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
it
and
eldret
announcement
thrilled
me
with
pleasure
i
was
to
return
in
time
to
commence
the
labors
of
the
day
on
tuesday
morning
while
indulging
the
pleasant
anticipation
of
so
soon
meeting
my
old
friends
again
suddenly
the
hateful
form
of
tibeats
appeared
among
us
he
inquired
how
myers
and
platt
got
along
together
and
was
told
very
well
and
that
platt
was
going
up
to
ford
plantation
in
the
morning
on
a
visit
poh
poh
sneered
tibeats
it
is
worth
while
the
nigger
will
get
unsteady
he
ca
go
but
eldret
insisted
i
had
worked
faithfully
that
he
had
given
me
his
promise
and
that
under
the
circumstances
i
ought
not
to
be
disappointed
they
then
it
being
about
dark
entered
one
cabin
and
i
the
other
i
could
not
give
up
the
idea
of
going
it
was
a
sore
disappointment
before
morning
i
resolved
if
eldret
made
no
objection
to
leave
at
all
hazards
at
daylight
i
was
at
his
door
with
my
blanket
rolled
up
into
a
bundle
and
hanging
on
a
stick
over
my
shoulder
waiting
for
a
pass
tibeats
came
out
presently
in
one
of
his
disagreeable
moods
washed
his
face
and
going
to
a
stump
near
by
sat
down
upon
it
apparently
busily
thinking
with
himself
after
standing
there
a
long
time
impelled
by
a
sudden
impulse
of
impatience
i
started
off
are
you
going
without
a
pass
he
cried
out
to
me
yes
master
i
thought
i
would
i
answered
how

into

as
he
said

with

calling

this
is
the
usual
form
on
the
way
a
great
many
demanded
it
read
it
and
passed
on
those
having
the
air
and
appearance
of
gentlemen
whose
dress
indicated
the
possession
of
wealth
frequently
took
no
notice
of
me
whatever
but
a
shabby
fellow
an
unmistakable
loafer
never
failed
to
hail
me
and
to
scrutinize
and
examine
me
in
the
most
thorough
manner
catching
runaways
is
sometimes
a
business
if
after
advertising
no
owner
appears
they
may
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
and
certain
fees
are
allowed
the
finder
for
his
services
at
all
events
even
if
reclaimed
a
mean
white
therefore
a
name
applied
to
the
species
loafer
considers
it
a
to
meet
an
unknown
negro
without
a
pass
there
are
no
inns
along
the
highways
in
that
portion
of
the
state
where
i
sojourned
i
was
wholly
destitute
of
money
neither
did
i
carry
any
provisions
on
my
journey
from
the
big
cane
to
bayou
boeuf
nevertheless
with
his
pass
in
his
hand
a
slave
need
never
suffer
from
hunger
or
from
thirst
it
is
only
necessary
to
present
it
to
the
master
or
overseer
of
a
plantation
and
state
his
wants
when
he
will
be
sent
round
to
the
kitchen
and
provided
with
food
or
shelter
as
the
case
may
require
the
traveler
stops
at
any
house
and
calls
for
a
meal
with
as
much
freedom
as
if
it
was
a
public
tavern
it
is
the
general
custom
of
the
country
whatever
their
faults
may
be
it
is
certain
the
inhabitants
along
red
river
and
around
the
bayous
in
the
interior
of
louisiana
are
not
wanting
in
hospitality
i
arrived
at
ford
plantation
towards
the
close
of
the
afternoon
passing
the
evening
in
eliza
cabin
with
lawson
rachel
and
others
of
my
acquaintance
when
we
left
washington
eliza
form
was
round
and
plump
she
stood
erect
and
in
her
silks
and
jewels
presented
a
picture
of
graceful
strength
and
elegance
now
she
was
but
a
thin
shadow
of
her
former
self
her
face
had
become
ghastly
haggard
and
the
once
straight
and
active
form
was
bowed
down
as
if
bearing
the
weight
of
a
hundred
years
crouching
on
her
cabin
floor
and
clad
in
the
coarse
garments
of
a
slave
old
elisha
berry
would
not
have
recognized
the
mother
of
his
child
i
never
saw
her
afterwards
having
become
useless
in
the
she
was
bartered
for
a
trifle
to
some
man
residing
in
the
vicinity
of
peter
compton
grief
had
gnawed
remorselessly
at
her
heart
until
her
strength
was
gone
and
for
that
her
last
master
it
is
said
lashed
and
abused
her
most
unmercifully
but
he
could
not
whip
back
the
departed
vigor
of
her
youth
nor
straighten
up
that
bended
body
to
its
full
height
such
as
it
was
when
her
children
were
around
her
and
the
light
of
freedom
was
shining
on
her
path
i
learned
the
particulars
relative
to
her
departure
from
this
world
from
some
of
compton
slaves
who
had
come
over
red
river
to
the
bayou
to
assist
young
madam
tanner
during
the
busy
season
she
became
at
length
they
said
utterly
helpless
for
several
weeks
lying
on
the
ground
floor
in
a
dilapidated
cabin
dependent
upon
the
mercy
of
her
for
an
occasional
drop
of
water
and
a
morsel
of
food
her
master
did
not
knock
her
on
the
head
as
is
sometimes
done
to
put
a
suffering
animal
out
of
misery
but
left
her
unprovided
for
and
unprotected
to
linger
through
a
life
of
pain
and
wretchedness
to
its
natural
close
when
the
hands
returned
from
the
field
one
night
they
found
her
dead
during
the
day
the
angel
of
the
lord
who
moveth
invisibly
over
all
the
earth
gathering
in
his
harvest
of
departing
souls
had
silently
entered
the
cabin
of
the
dying
woman
and
taken
her
from
thence
she
was
at
last
next
day
rolling
up
my
blanket
i
started
on
my
return
to
the
big
cane
after
traveling
five
miles
at
a
place
called
huff
power
the
tibeats
met
me
in
the
road
he
inquired
why
i
was
going
back
so
soon
and
when
informed
i
was
anxious
to
return
by
the
time
i
was
directed
he
said
i
need
go
no
farther
than
the
next
plantation
as
he
had
that
day
sold
me
to
edwin
epps
we
walked
down
into
the
yard
where
we
met
the
latter
gentleman
who
examined
me
and
asked
me
the
usual
questions
propounded
by
purchasers
having
been
duly
delivered
over
i
was
ordered
to
the
quarters
and
at
the
same
time
directed
to
make
a
hoe
and
axe
handle
for
myself
i
was
now
no
longer
the
property
of
tibeats
his
dog
his
brute
dreading
his
wrath
and
cruelty
day
and
night
and
whoever
or
whatever
my
new
master
might
prove
to
be
i
could
not
certainly
regret
the
change
so
it
was
good
news
when
the
sale
was
announced
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
sat
down
for
the
first
time
in
my
new
abode
tibeats
soon
after
disappeared
from
that
section
of
the
country
once
afterwards
and
only
once
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
it
was
many
miles
from
bayou
boeuf
he
was
seated
in
the
doorway
of
a
low

edwin
epps
of
whom
much
will
be
said
during
the
remainder
of
this
history
is
a
large
portly
man
with
light
hair
high
cheek
bones
and
a
roman
nose
of
extraordinary
dimensions
he
has
blue
eyes
a
fair
complexion
and
is
as
i
should
say
full
six
feet
high
he
has
the
sharp
inquisitive
expression
of
a
jockey
his
manners
are
repulsive
and
coarse
and
his
language
gives
speedy
and
unequivocal
evidence
that
he
has
never
enjoyed
the
advantages
of
an
education
he
has
the
faculty
of
saying
most
provoking
things
in
that
respect
even
excelling
old
peter
tanner
at
the
time
i
came
into
his
possession
edwin
epps
was
fond
of
the
bottle
his
sprees
sometimes
extending
over
the
space
of
two
whole
weeks
latterly
however
he
had
reformed
his
habits
and
when
i
left
him
was
as
strict
a
specimen
of
temperance
as
could
be
found
on
bayou
boeuf
when
in
his
cups
master
epps
was
a
roystering
blustering
noisy
fellow
whose
chief
delight
was
in
dancing
with
his
niggers
or
lashing
them
about
the
yard
with
his
long
whip
just
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
them
screech
and
scream
as
the
great
welts
were
planted
on
their
backs
when
sober
he
was
silent
reserved
and
cunning
not
beating
us
indiscriminately
as
in
his
drunken
moments
but
sending
the
end
of
his
rawhide
to
some
tender
spot
of
a
lagging
slave
with
a
sly
dexterity
peculiar
to
himself
he
had
been
a
driver
and
overseer
in
his
younger
years
but
at
this
time
was
in
possession
of
a
plantation
on
bayou
huff
power
two
and
a
half
miles
from
holmesville
eighteen
from
marksville
and
twelve
from
cheneyville
it
belonged
to
joseph
roberts
his
wife
uncle
and
was
leased
by
epps
his
principal
business
was
raising
cotton
and
inasmuch
as
some
may
read
this
book
who
have
never
seen
a
cotton
field
a
description
of
the
manner
of
its
culture
may
not
be
out
of
place
the
ground
is
prepared
by
throwing
up
beds
or
ridges
with
the
plough
it
is
called
oxen
and
mules
the
latter
almost
exclusively
are
used
in
ploughing
the
women
as
frequently
as
the
men
perform
this
labor
feeding
currying
and
taking
care
of
their
teams
and
in
all
respects
doing
the
field
and
stable
work
precisely
as
do
the
ploughboys
of
the
north
the
beds
or
ridges
are
six
feet
wide
that
is
from
water
furrow
to
water
furrow
a
plough
drawn
by
one
mule
is
then
run
along
the
top
of
the
ridge
or
center
of
the
bed
making
the
drill
into
which
a
girl
usually
drops
the
seed
which
she
carries
in
a
bag
hung
round
her
neck
behind
her
comes
a
mule
and
harrow
covering
up
the
seed
so
that
two
mules
three
slaves
a
plough
and
harrow
are
employed
in
planting
a
row
of
cotton
this
is
done
in
the
months
of
march
and
april
corn
is
planted
in
february
when
there
are
no
cold
rains
the
cotton
usually
makes
its
appearance
in
a
week
in
the
course
of
eight
or
ten
days
afterwards
the
first
hoeing
is
commenced
this
is
performed
in
part
also
by
the
aid
of
the
plough
and
mule
the
plough
passes
as
near
as
possible
to
the
cotton
on
both
sides
throwing
the
furrow
from
it
slaves
follow
with
their
hoes
cutting
up
the
grass
and
cotton
leaving
hills
two
feet
and
a
half
apart
this
is
called
scraping
cotton
in
two
weeks
more
commences
the
second
hoeing
this
time
the
furrow
is
thrown
towards
the
cotton
only
one
stalk
the
largest
is
now
left
standing
in
each
hill
in
another
fortnight
it
is
hoed
the
third
time
throwing
the
furrow
towards
the
cotton
in
the
same
manner
as
before
and
killing
all
the
grass
between
the
rows
about
the
first
of
july
when
it
is
a
foot
high
or
thereabouts
it
is
hoed
the
fourth
and
last
time
now
the
whole
space
between
the
rows
is
ploughed
leaving
a
deep
water
furrow
in
the
center
during
all
these
hoeings
the
overseer
or
driver
follows
the
slaves
on
horseback
with
a
whip
such
as
has
been
described
the
fastest
hoer
takes
the
lead
row
he
is
usually
about
a
rod
in
advance
of
his
companions
if
one
of
them
passes
him
he
is
whipped
if
one
falls
behind
or
is
a
moment
idle
he
is
whipped
in
fact
the
lash
is
flying
from
morning
until
night
the
whole
day
long
the
hoeing
season
thus
continues
from
april
until
july
a
field
having
no
sooner
been
finished
once
than
it
is
commenced
again
in
the
latter
part
of
august
begins
the
cotton
picking
season
at
this
time
each
slave
is
presented
with
a
sack
a
strap
is
fastened
to
it
which
goes
over
the
neck
holding
the
mouth
of
the
sack
breast
high
while
the
bottom
reaches
nearly
to
the
ground
each
one
is
also
presented
with
a
large
basket
that
will
hold
about
two
barrels
this
is
to
put
the
cotton
in
when
the
sack
is
filled
the
baskets
are
carried
to
the
field
and
placed
at
the
beginning
of
the
rows
when
a
new
hand
one
unaccustomed
to
the
business
is
sent
for
the
first
time
into
the
field
he
is
whipped
up
smartly
and
made
for
that
day
to
pick
as
fast
as
he
can
possibly
at
night
it
is
weighed
so
that
his
capability
in
cotton
picking
is
known
he
must
bring
in
the
same
weight
each
night
following
if
it
falls
short
it
is
considered
evidence
that
he
has
been
laggard
and
a
greater
or
less
number
of
lashes
is
the
penalty
an
ordinary
day
work
is
two
hundred
pounds
a
slave
who
is
accustomed
to
picking
is
punished
if
he
or
she
brings
in
a
less
quantity
than
that
there
is
a
great
difference
among
them
as
regards
this
kind
of
labor
some
of
them
seem
to
have
a
natural
knack
or
quickness
which
enables
them
to
pick
with
great
celerity
and
with
both
hands
while
others
with
whatever
practice
or
industry
are
utterly
unable
to
come
up
to
the
ordinary
standard
such
hands
are
taken
from
the
cotton
field
and
employed
in
other
business
patsey
of
whom
i
shall
have
more
to
say
was
known
as
the
most
remarkable
cotton
picker
on
bayou
boeuf
she
picked
with
both
hands
and
with
such
surprising
rapidity
that
five
hundred
pounds
a
day
was
not
unusual
for
her
each
one
is
tasked
therefore
according
to
his
picking
abilities
none
however
to
come
short
of
two
hundred
weight
i
being
unskillful
always
in
that
business
would
have
satisfied
my
master
by
bringing
in
the
latter
quantity
while
on
the
other
hand
patsey
would
surely
have
been
beaten
if
she
failed
to
produce
twice
as
much
the
cotton
grows
from
five
to
seven
feet
high
each
stalk
having
a
great
many
branches
shooting
out
in
all
directions
and
lapping
each
other
above
the
water
furrow
there
are
few
sights
more
pleasant
to
the
eye
than
a
wide
cotton
field
when
it
is
in
the
bloom
it
presents
an
appearance
of
purity
like
an
immaculate
expanse
of
light
snow
sometimes
the
slave
picks
down
one
side
of
a
row
and
back
upon
the
other
but
more
usually
there
is
one
on
either
side
gathering
all
that
has
blossomed
leaving
the
unopened
bolls
for
a
succeeding
picking
when
the
sack
is
filled
it
is
emptied
into
the
basket
and
trodden
down
it
is
necessary
to
be
extremely
careful
the
first
time
going
through
the
field
in
order
not
to
break
the
branches
off
the
stalks
the
cotton
will
not
bloom
upon
a
broken
branch
epps
never
failed
to
inflict
the
severest
chastisement
on
the
unlucky
servant
who
either
carelessly
or
unavoidably
was
guilty
in
the
least
degree
in
this
respect
the
hands
are
required
to
be
in
the
cotton
field
as
soon
as
it
is
light
in
the
morning
and
with
the
exception
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
which
is
given
them
at
noon
to
swallow
their
allowance
of
cold
bacon
they
are
not
permitted
to
be
a
moment
idle
until
it
is
too
dark
to
see
and
when
the
moon
is
full
they
often
times
labor
till
the
middle
of
the
night
they
do
not
dare
to
stop
even
at
dinner
time
nor
return
to
the
quarters
however
late
it
be
until
the
order
to
halt
is
given
by
the
driver
the
day
work
over
in
the
field
the
baskets
are
toted
or
in
other
words
carried
to
the
where
the
cotton
is
weighed
no
matter
how
fatigued
and
weary
he
may
be
no
matter
how
much
he
longs
for
sleep
and
rest
a
slave
never
approaches
the
with
his
basket
of
cotton
but
with
fear
if
it
falls
short
in
weight
if
he
has
not
performed
the
full
task
appointed
him
he
knows
that
he
must
suffer
and
if
he
has
exceeded
it
by
ten
or
twenty
pounds
in
all
probability
his
master
will
measure
the
next
day
task
accordingly
so
whether
he
has
too
little
or
too
much
his
approach
to
the
is
always
with
fear
and
trembling
most
frequently
they
have
too
little
and
therefore
it
is
they
are
not
anxious
to
leave
the
field
after
weighing
follow
the
whippings
and
then
the
baskets
are
carried
to
the
cotton
house
and
their
contents
stored
away
like
hay
all
hands
being
sent
in
to
tramp
it
down
if
the
cotton
is
not
dry
instead
of
taking
it
to
the
at
once
it
is
laid
upon
platforms
two
feet
high
and
some
three
times
as
wide
covered
with
boards
or
plank
with
narrow
walks
running
between
them
this
done
the
labor
of
the
day
is
not
yet
ended
by
any
means
each
one
must
then
attend
to
his
respective
chores
one
feeds
the
mules
another
the
swine
another
cuts
the
wood
and
so
forth
besides
the
packing
is
all
done
by
candle
light
finally
at
a
late
hour
they
reach
the
quarters
sleepy
and
overcome
with
the
long
day
toil
then
a
fire
must
be
kindled
in
the
cabin
the
corn
ground
in
the
small
and
supper
and
dinner
for
the
next
day
in
the
field
prepared
all
that
is
allowed
them
is
corn
and
bacon
which
is
given
out
at
the
corncrib
and
every
sunday
morning
each
one
receives
as
his
weekly
allowance
three
and
a
half
pounds
of
bacon
and
corn
enough
to
make
a
peck
of
meal
that
is
all
no
tea
coffee
sugar
and
with
the
exception
of
a
very
scanty
sprinkling
now
and
then
no
salt
i
can
say
from
a
ten
years
residence
with
master
epps
that
no
slave
of
his
is
ever
likely
to
suffer
from
the
gout
superinduced
by
excessive
high
living
master
epps
hogs
were
fed
on
corn
it
was
thrown
out
to
his
niggers
in
the
ear
the
former
he
thought
would
fatten
faster
by
shelling
and
soaking
it
in
the
water
the
latter
perhaps
if
treated
in
the
same
manner
might
grow
too
fat
to
labor
master
epps
was
a
shrewd
calculator
and
knew
how
to
manage
his
own
animals
drunk
or
sober
the
corn
mill
stands
in
the
yard
beneath
a
shelter
it
is
like
a
common
coffee
mill
the
hopper
holding
about
six
quarts
there
was
one
privilege
which
master
epps
granted
freely
to
every
slave
he
had
they
might
grind
their
corn
nightly
in
such
small
quantities
as
their
daily
wants
required
or
they
might
grind
the
whole
week
allowance
at
one
time
on
sundays
just
as
they
preferred
a
very
generous
man
was
master
epps
i
kept
my
corn
in
a
small
wooden
box
the
meal
in
a
gourd
and
by
the
way
the
gourd
is
one
of
the
most
convenient
and
necessary
utensils
on
a
plantation
besides
supplying
the
place
of
all
kinds
of
crockery
in
a
slave
cabin
it
is
used
for
carrying
water
to
the
fields
another
also
contains
the
dinner
it
dispenses
with
the
necessity
of
pails
dippers
basins
and
such
tin
and
wooden
superfluities
altogether
when
the
corn
is
ground
and
fire
is
made
the
bacon
is
taken
down
from
the
nail
on
which
it
hangs
a
slice
cut
off
and
thrown
upon
the
coals
to
broil
the
majority
of
slaves
have
no
knife
much
less
a
fork
they
cut
their
bacon
with
the
axe
at
the
the
corn
meal
is
mixed
with
a
little
water
placed
in
the
fire
and
baked
when
it
is
done
brown
the
ashes
are
scraped
off
and
being
placed
upon
a
chip
which
answers
for
a
table
the
tenant
of
the
slave
hut
is
ready
to
sit
down
upon
the
ground
to
supper
by
this
time
it
is
usually
midnight
the
same
fear
of
punishment
with
which
they
approach
the
possesses
them
again
on
lying
down
to
get
a
snatch
of
rest
it
is
the
fear
of
oversleeping
in
the
morning
such
an
offence
would
certainly
be
attended
with
not
less
than
twenty
lashes
with
a
prayer
that
he
may
be
on
his
feet
and
wide
awake
at
the
first
sound
of
the
horn
he
sinks
to
his
slumbers
nightly
the
softest
couches
in
the
world
are
not
to
be
found
in
the
log
mansion
of
the
slave
the
one
whereon
i
reclined
year
after
year
was
a
plank
twelve
inches
wide
and
ten
feet
long
my
pillow
was
a
stick
of
wood
the
bedding
was
a
coarse
blanket
and
not
a
rag
or
shred
beside
moss
might
be
used
were
it
not
that
it
directly
breeds
a
swarm
of
fleas
the
cabin
is
constructed
of
logs
without
floor
or
window
the
latter
is
altogether
unnecessary
the
crevices
between
the
logs
admitting
sufficient
light
in
stormy
weather
the
rain
drives
through
them
rendering
it
comfortless
and
extremely
disagreeable
the
rude
door
hangs
on
great
wooden
hinges
in
one
end
is
constructed
an
awkward
an
hour
before
day
light
the
horn
is
blown
then
the
slaves
arouse
prepare
their
breakfast
fill
a
gourd
with
water
in
another
deposit
their
dinner
of
cold
bacon
and
corn
cake
and
hurry
to
the
field
again
it
is
an
offence
invariably
followed
by
a
flogging
to
be
found
at
the
quarters
after
daybreak
then
the
fears
and
labors
of
another
day
begin
and
until
its
close
there
is
no
such
thing
as
rest
he
fears
he
will
be
caught
lagging
through
the
day
he
fears
to
approach
the
with
his
of
cotton
at
night
he
fears
when
he
lies
down
that
he
will
oversleep
himself
in
the
morning
such
is
a
true
faithful
unexaggerated
picture
and
description
of
the
daily
life
during
the
time
of
on
the
shores
of
bayou
boeuf
in
the
month
of
january
generally
the
fourth
and
last
picking
is
completed
then
commences
the
harvesting
of
corn
this
is
considered
a
secondary
crop
and
receives
far
less
attention
than
the
cotton
it
is
planted
as
already
mentioned
in
february
corn
is
grown
in
that
region
for
the
purpose
of
fattening
hogs
and
feeding
slaves
very
little
if
any
being
sent
to
market
it
is
the
white
variety
the
ear
of
great
size
and
the
stalk
growing
to
the
height
of
eight
and
often
times
ten
feet
in
august
the
leaves
are
stripped
off
dried
in
the
sun
bound
in
small
bundles
and
stored
away
as
provender
for
the
mules
and
oxen
after
this
the
slaves
go
through
the
field
turning
down
the
ear
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
rains
from
penetrating
to
the
grain
it
is
left
in
this
condition
until
after
is
over
whether
earlier
or
later
then
the
ears
are
separated
from
the
stalks
and
deposited
in
the
corncrib
with
the
husks
on
otherwise
stripped
of
the
husks
the
weevil
would
destroy
it
the
stalks
are
left
standing
in
the
field
the
carolina
or
sweet
potato
is
also
grown
in
that
region
to
some
extent
they
are
not
fed
however
to
hogs
or
cattle
and
are
considered
but
of
small
importance
they
are
preserved
by
placing
them
upon
the
surface
of
the
ground
with
a
slight
covering
of
earth
or
cornstalks
there
is
not
a
cellar
on
bayou
boeuf
the
ground
is
so
low
it
would
fill
with
water
potatoes
are
worth
from
two
to
three
bits
or
shillings
a
barrel
corn
except
when
there
is
an
unusual
scarcity
can
be
purchased
at
the
same
rate
as
soon
as
the
cotton
and
corn
crops
are
secured
the
stalks
are
pulled
up
thrown
into
piles
and
burned
the
ploughs
are
started
at
the
same
time
throwing
up
the
beds
again
preparatory
to
another
planting
the
soil
in
the
parishes
of
rapides
and
avoyelles
and
throughout
the
whole
country
so
far
as
my
observation
extended
is
of
exceeding
richness
and
fertility
it
is
a
kind
of
marl
of
a
brown
or
reddish
color
it
does
not
require
those
invigorating
composts
necessary
to
more
barren
lands
and
on
the
same
field
the
same
crop
is
grown
for
many
successive
years
ploughing
planting
picking
cotton
gathering
the
corn
and
pulling
and
burning
stalks
occupies
the
whole
of
the
four
seasons
of
the
year
drawing
and
cutting
wood
pressing
cotton
fattening
and
killing
hogs
are
but
incidental
labors
in
the
month
of
september
or
october
the
hogs
are
run
out
of
the
swamps
by
dogs
and
confined
in
pens
on
a
cold
morning
generally
about
new
year
day
they
are
slaughtered
each
carcass
is
cut
into
six
parts
and
piled
one
above
the
other
in
salt
upon
large
tables
in
the
in
this
condition
it
remains
a
fortnight
when
it
is
hung
up
and
a
fire
built
and
continued
more
than
half
the
time
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
this
thorough
smoking
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
bacon
from
becoming
infested
with
worms
in
so
warm
a
climate
it
is
difficult
to
preserve
it
and
very
many
times
myself
and
my
companions
have
received
our
weekly
allowance
of
three
pounds
and
a
half
when
it
was
full
of
these
disgusting
vermin
although
the
swamps
are
overrun
with
cattle
they
are
never
made
the
source
of
profit
to
any
considerable
extent
the
planter
cuts
his
mark
upon
the
ear
or
brands
his
initials
upon
the
side
and
turns
them
into
the
swamps
to
roam
unrestricted
within
their
almost
limitless
confines
they
are
the
spanish
breed
small
and
i
have
known
of
droves
being
taken
from
bayou
boeuf
but
it
is
of
very
rare
occurrence
the
value
of
the
best
cows
is
about
five
dollars
each
two
quarts
at
one
milking
would
be
considered
an
unusual
large
quantity
they
furnish
little
tallow
and
that
of
a
soft
inferior
quality
notwithstanding
the
great
number
of
cows
that
throng
the
swamps
the
planters
are
indebted
to
the
north
for
their
cheese
and
butter
which
is
purchased
in
the
market
salted
beef
is
not
an
article
of
food
either
in
the
great
house
or
in
the
cabin
master
epps
was
accustomed
to
attend
shooting
matches
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
what
fresh
beef
he
required
these
sports

the

in

the
great
number
of
tame
and
untamed
cattle
which
swarm
the
woods
and
swamps

most
probably
suggested
that
appellation
to
the

the
term
translated
signifies

the
victim
on
my
arrival
at
master
epps
in
obedience
to
his
order
the
first
business
upon
which
i
entered
was
the
making
of
an
the
handles
in
use
there
are
simply
a
round
straight
stick
i
made
a
crooked
one
shaped
like
those
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
at
the
north
when
finished
and
presented
to
epps
he
looked
at
it
with
astonishment
unable
to
determine
exactly
what
it
was
he
had
never
before
seen
such
a
handle
and
when
i
explained
its
conveniences
he
was
forcibly
struck
with
the
novelty
of
the
idea
he
kept
it
in
the
house
a
long
time
and
when
his
friends
called
was
wont
to
exhibit
it
as
a
curiosity
it
was
now
the
season
of
hoeing
i
was
first
sent
into
the
and
afterwards
set
to
scraping
cotton
in
this
employment
i
remained
until
hoeing
time
was
nearly
passed
when
i
began
to
experience
the
symptoms
of
approaching
illness
i
was
attacked
with
chills
which
were
succeeded
by
a
burning
fever
i
became
weak
and
emaciated
and
frequently
so
dizzy
that
it
caused
me
to
reel
and
stagger
like
a
drunken
man
nevertheless
i
was
compelled
to
keep
up
my
row
when
in
health
i
found
little
difficulty
in
keeping
pace
with
my
but
now
it
seemed
to
be
an
utter
impossibility
often
i
fell
behind
when
the
driver
lash
was
sure
to
greet
my
back
infusing
into
my
sick
and
drooping
body
a
little
temporary
energy
i
continued
to
decline
until
at
length
the
whip
became
entirely
ineffectual
the
sharpest
sting
of
the
rawhide
could
not
arouse
me
finally
in
september
when
the
busy
season
of
cotton
picking
was
at
hand
i
was
unable
to
leave
my
cabin
up
to
this
time
i
had
received
no
medicine
nor
any
attention
from
my
master
or
mistress
the
old
cook
visited
me
occasionally
preparing
me
and
sometimes
boiling
a
bit
of
bacon
when
i
had
grown
too
feeble
to
accomplish
it
myself
when
it
was
said
that
i
would
die
master
epps
unwilling
to
bear
the
loss
which
the
death
of
an
animal
worth
a
thousand
dollars
would
bring
upon
him
concluded
to
incur
the
expense
of
sending
to
holmesville
for
dr
wines
he
announced
to
epps
that
it
was
the
effect
of
the
climate
and
there
was
a
probability
of
his
losing
me
he
directed
me
to
eat
no
meat
and
to
partake
of
no
more
food
than
was
absolutely
necessary
to
sustain
life
several
weeks
elapsed
during
which
time
under
the
scanty
diet
to
which
i
was
subjected
i
had
partially
recovered
one
morning
long
before
i
was
in
a
proper
condition
to
labor
epps
appeared
at
the
cabin
door
and
presenting
me
a
sack
ordered
me
to
the
cotton
field
at
this
time
i
had
had
no
experience
whatever
in
cotton
picking
it
was
an
awkward
business
indeed
while
others
used
both
hands
snatching
the
cotton
and
depositing
it
in
the
mouth
of
the
sack
with
a
precision
and
dexterity
that
was
incomprehensible
to
me
i
had
to
seize
the
boll
with
one
hand
and
deliberately
draw
out
the
white
gushing
blossom
with
the
other
depositing
the
cotton
in
the
sack
moreover
was
a
difficulty
that
demanded
the
exercise
of
both
hands
and
eyes
i
was
compelled
to
pick
it
from
the
ground
where
it
would
fall
nearly
as
often
as
from
the
stalk
where
it
had
grown
i
made
havoc
also
with
the
branches
loaded
with
the
yet
unbroken
bolls
the
long
cumbersome
sack
swinging
from
side
to
side
in
a
manner
not
allowable
in
the
cotton
field
after
a
most
laborious
day
i
arrived
at
the
with
my
load
when
the
scale
determined
its
weight
to
be
only
pounds
not
half
the
quantity
required
of
the
poorest
picker
epps
threatened
the
severest
flogging
but
in
consideration
of
my
being
a
raw
hand
concluded
to
pardon
me
on
that
occasion
the
following
day
and
many
days
succeeding
i
returned
at
night
with
no
better
success
i
was
evidently
not
designed
for
that
kind
of
labor
i
had
not
the
gift
the
dexterous
fingers
and
quick
motion
of
patsey
who
could
fly
along
one
side
of
a
row
of
cotton
stripping
it
of
its
undefiled
and
fleecy
whiteness
miraculously
fast
practice
and
whipping
were
alike
unavailing
and
epps
satisfied
of
it
at
last
swore
i
was
a
disgrace
that
i
was
not
fit
to
associate
with
a
nigger
that
i
could
not
pick
enough
in
a
day
to
pay
the
trouble
of
weighing
it
and
that
i
should
go
into
the
cotton
field
no
more
i
was
now
employed
in
cutting
and
hauling
wood
drawing
cotton
from
the
field
to
the
and
performed
whatever
other
service
was
required
suffice
to
say
i
was
never
permitted
to
be
idle
it
was
rarely
that
a
day
passed
by
without
one
or
more
whippings
this
occurred
at
the
time
the
cotton
was
weighed
the
delinquent
whose
weight
had
fallen
short
was
taken
out
stripped
made
to
lie
upon
the
ground
face
downwards
when
he
received
a
punishment
proportioned
to
his
offence
it
is
the
literal
unvarnished
truth
that
the
crack
of
the
lash
and
the
shrieking
of
the
slaves
can
be
heard
from
dark
till
bed
time
on
epps
plantation
any
day
almost
during
the
entire
period
of
the
season
the
number
of
lashes
is
graduated
according
to
the
nature
of
the
case
are
deemed
a
mere
brush
inflicted
for
instance
when
a
dry
leaf
or
piece
of
boll
is
found
in
the
cotton
or
when
a
branch
is
broken
in
the
field
fifty
is
the
ordinary
penalty
following
all
delinquencies
of
the
next
higher
grade
one
hundred
is
called
severe
it
is
the
punishment
inflicted
for
the
serious
offence
of
standing
idle
in
the
field
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
is
bestowed
upon
him
who
quarrels
with
his
and
five
hundred
well
laid
on
besides
the
mangling
of
the
dogs
perhaps
is
certain
to
consign
the
poor
unpitied
runaway
to
weeks
of
pain
and
agony
during
the
two
years
epps
remained
on
the
plantation
at
bayou
huff
power
he
was
in
the
habit
as
often
as
once
in
a
fortnight
at
least
of
coming
home
intoxicated
from
holmesville
the
almost
invariably
concluded
with
a
debauch
at
such
times
he
was
boisterous
and
often
he
would
break
the
dishes
chairs
and
whatever
furniture
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
when
satisfied
with
his
amusement
in
the
house
he
would
seize
the
whip
and
walk
forth
into
the
yard
then
it
behooved
the
slaves
to
be
watchful
and
exceeding
wary
the
first
one
who
came
within
reach
felt
the
smart
of
his
lash
sometimes
for
hours
he
would
keep
them
running
in
all
directions
dodging
around
the
corners
of
the
cabins
occasionally
he
would
come
upon
one
unawares
and
if
he
succeeded
in
inflicting
a
fair
round
blow
it
was
a
feat
that
much
delighted
him
the
younger
children
and
the
aged
who
had
become
inactive
suffered
then
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
he
would
slily
take
his
stand
behind
a
cabin
waiting
with
raised
whip
to
dash
it
into
the
first
black
face
that
peeped
cautiously
around
the
corner
at
other
times
he
would
come
home
in
a
less
brutal
humor
then
there
must
be
a
then
all
must
move
to
the
measure
of
a
tune
then
master
epps
must
needs
regale
his
melodious
ears
with
the
music
of
a
fiddle
then
did
he
become
buoyant
elastic
gaily
tripping
the
light
fantastic
toe
around
the
piazza
and
all
through
the
house
tibeats
at
the
time
of
my
sale
had
informed
him
i
could
play
on
the
violin
he
had
received
his
information
from
ford
through
the
importunities
of
mistress
epps
her
husband
had
been
induced
to
purchase
me
one
during
a
visit
to
frequently
i
was
called
into
the
house
to
play
before
the
family
mistress
being
passionately
fond
of
music
all
of
us
would
be
assembled
in
the
large
room
of
the
great
house
whenever
epps
came
home
in
one
of
his
dancing
moods
no
matter
how
worn
out
and
tired
we
were
there
must
be
a
general
dance
when
properly
stationed
on
the
floor
i
would
strike
up
a
tune
dance
you
d
d
niggers
dance
epps
would
shout
then
there
must
be
no
halting
or
delay
no
slow
or
languid
movements
all
must
be
brisk
and
lively
and
alert
up
and
down
heel
and
toe
and
away
we
go
was
the
order
of
the
hour
epps
portly
form
mingled
with
those
of
his
dusky
slaves
moving
rapidly
through
all
the
mazes
of
the
dance
usually
his
whip
was
in
his
hand
ready
to
fall
about
the
ears
of
the
presumptuous
thrall
who
dared
to
rest
a
moment
or
even
stop
to
catch
his
breath
when
he
was
himself
exhausted
there
would
be
a
brief
cessation
but
it
would
be
very
brief
with
a
slash
and
crack
and
flourish
of
the
whip
he
would
shout
again
dance
niggers
dance
and
away
they
would
go
once
more
while
i
spurred
by
an
occasional
sharp
touch
of
the
lash
sat
in
a
corner
extracting
from
my
violin
a
marvelous
tune
the
mistress
often
upbraided
him
declaring
she
would
return
to
her
father
house
at
cheneyville
nevertheless
there
were
times
she
could
not
restrain
a
burst
of
laughter
on
witnessing
his
uproarious
pranks
frequently
we
were
thus
detained
until
almost
morning
bent
with
excessive
toil
actually
suffering
for
a
little
refreshing
rest
and
feeling
rather
as
if
we
could
cast
ourselves
upon
the
earth
and
weep
many
a
night
in
the
house
of
edwin
epps
have
his
unhappy
slaves
been
made
to
dance
and
laugh
notwithstanding
these
deprivations
in
order
to
gratify
the
whim
of
an
unreasonable
master
we
had
to
be
in
the
field
as
soon
as
it
was
light
and
during
the
day
perform
the
ordinary
and
accustomed
task
such
deprivations
could
not
be
urged
at
the
scales
in
extenuation
of
any
lack
of
weight
or
in
the
cornfield
for
not
hoeing
with
the
usual
rapidity
the
whippings
were
just
as
severe
as
if
we
had
gone
forth
in
the
morning
strengthened
and
invigorated
by
a
night
repose
indeed
after
such
frantic
revels
he
was
always
more
sour
and
savage
than
before
punishing
for
slighter
causes
and
using
the
whip
with
increased
and
more
vindictive
energy
ten
years
i
toiled
for
that
man
without
reward
ten
years
of
my
incessant
labor
has
contributed
to
increase
the
bulk
of
his
possessions
ten
years
i
was
compelled
to
address
him
with
eyes
and
uncovered
head
in
the
attitude
and
language
of
a
slave
i
am
indebted
to
him
for
nothing
save
undeserved
abuse
and
stripes
beyond
the
reach
of
his
inhuman
thong
and
standing
on
the
soil
of
the
free
state
where
i
was
born
thanks
be
to
heaven
i
can
raise
my
head
once
more
among
men
i
can
speak
of
the
wrongs
i
have
suffered
and
of
those
who
inflicted
them
with
upraised
eyes
but
i
have
no
desire
to
speak
of
him
or
any
other
one
otherwise
than
truthfully
yet
to
speak
truthfully
of
edwin
epps
would
be
to
say
he
is
a
man
in
whose
heart
the
quality
of
kindness
or
of
justice
is
not
found
a
rough
rude
energy
united
with
an
uncultivated
mind
and
an
avaricious
spirit
are
his
prominent
characteristics
he
is
known
as
a
nigger
breaker
distinguished
for
his
faculty
of
subduing
the
spirit
of
the
slave
and
priding
himself
upon
his
reputation
in
this
respect
as
a
jockey
boasts
of
his
skill
in
managing
a
refractory
horse
he
looked
upon
a
colored
man
not
as
a
human
being
responsible
to
his
creator
for
the
small
talent
entrusted
to
him
but
as
a
chattel
personal
as
mere
live
property
no
better
except
in
value
than
his
mule
or
dog
when
the
evidence
clear
and
indisputable
was
laid
before
him
that
i
was
a
free
man
and
as
much
entitled
to
my
liberty
as
he
when
on
the
day
i
left
he
was
informed
that
i
had
a
wife
and
children
as
dear
to
me
as
his
own
babes
to
him
he
only
raved
and
swore
denouncing
the
law
that
tore
me
from
him
and
declaring
he
would
find
out
the
man
who
had
forwarded
the
letter
that
disclosed
the
place
of
my
captivity
if
there
was
any
virtue
or
power
in
money
and
would
take
his
life
he
thought
of
nothing
but
his
loss
and
cursed
me
for
having
been
born
free
he
could
have
stood
unmoved
and
seen
the
tongues
of
his
poor
slaves
torn
out
by
the
roots
he
could
have
seen
them
burned
to
ashes
over
a
slow
fire
or
gnawed
to
death
by
dogs
if
it
only
brought
him
profit
such
a
hard
cruel
unjust
man
is
edwin
epps
there
was
but
one
greater
savage
on
bayou
boeuf
than
he
jim
plantation
was
cultivated
as
already
mentioned
exclusively
by
women
that
barbarian
kept
their
backs
so
sore
and
raw
that
they
could
not
perform
the
customary
labor
demanded
daily
of
the
slave
he
boasted
of
his
cruelty
and
through
all
the
country
round
was
accounted
a
more
energetic
man
than
even
epps
a
brute
himself
jim
burns
had
not
a
particle
of
mercy
for
his
subject
brutes
and
like
a
fool
whipped
and
scourged
away
the
very
strength
upon
which
depended
his
amount
of
gain
epps
remained
on
huff
power
two
years
when
having
accumulated
a
considerable
sum
of
money
he
expended
it
in
the
purchase
of
the
plantation
on
the
east
bank
of
bayou
boeuf
where
he
still
continues
to
reside
he
took
possession
of
it
in
after
the
holidays
were
passed
he
carried
thither
with
him
nine
slaves
all
of
whom
except
myself
and
susan
who
has
since
died
remain
there
yet
he
made
no
addition
to
this
force
and
for
eight
years
the
following
were
my
companions
in
his
quarters
viz
abram
wiley
phebe
bob
henry
edward
and
patsey
all
these
except
edward
born
since
were
purchased
out
of
a
drove
by
epps
during
the
time
he
was
overseer
for
archy
williams
whose
plantation
is
situated
on
the
shore
of
red
river
not
far
from
alexandria
abram
was
tall
standing
a
full
head
above
any
common
man
he
is
sixty
years
of
age
and
was
born
in
tennessee
twenty
years
ago
he
was
purchased
by
a
trader
carried
into
south
carolina
and
sold
to
james
buford
of
williamsburgh
county
in
that
state
in
his
youth
he
was
renowned
for
his
great
strength
but
age
and
unremitting
toil
have
somewhat
shattered
his
powerful
frame
and
enfeebled
his
mental
faculties
wiley
is
he
was
born
on
the
estate
of
william
tassle
and
for
many
years
took
charge
of
that
gentleman
ferry
over
the
big
black
river
in
south
carolina
phebe
was
a
slave
of
buford
tassle
neighbor
and
having
married
wiley
he
bought
the
latter
at
her
instigation
buford
was
a
kind
master
sheriff
of
the
county
and
in
those
days
a
man
of
wealth
bob
and
henry
are
phebe
children
by
a
former
husband
their
father
having
been
abandoned
to
give
place
to
wiley
that
seductive
youth
had
insinuated
himself
into
phebe
affections
and
therefore
the
faithless
spouse
had
gently
kicked
her
first
husband
out
of
her
cabin
door
edward
had
been
born
to
them
on
bayou
huff
power
patsey
is
also
from
buford
plantation
she
is
in
no
wise
connected
with
the
others
but
glories
in
the
fact
that
she
is
the
offspring
of
a
guinea
nigger
brought
over
to
cuba
in
a
slave
ship
and
in
the
course
of
trade
transferred
to
buford
who
was
her
mother
owner
this
as
i
learned
from
them
is
a
genealogical
account
of
my
slaves
for
years
they
had
been
together
often
they
recalled
the
memories
of
other
days
and
sighed
to
retrace
their
steps
to
the
old
home
in
carolina
troubles
came
upon
their
master
buford
which
brought
far
greater
troubles
upon
them
he
became
involved
in
debt
and
unable
to
bear
up
against
his
failing
fortunes
was
compelled
to
sell
these
and
others
of
his
slaves
in
a
chain
gang
they
had
been
driven
from
beyond
the
mississippi
to
the
plantation
of
archy
williams
edwin
epps
who
for
a
long
while
had
been
his
driver
and
overseer
was
about
establishing
himself
in
business
on
his
own
account
at
the
time
of
their
arrival
and
accepted
them
in
payment
of
his
wages
old
abram
was
a
being
a
sort
of
patriarch
among
us
fond
of
entertaining
his
younger
brethren
with
grave
and
serious
discourse
he
was
deeply
versed
in
such
philosophy
as
is
taught
in
the
cabin
of
the
slave
but
the
great
absorbing
hobby
of
uncle
abram
was
general
jackson
whom
his
young
master
in
tennessee
had
followed
to
the
wars
he
loved
to
wander
back
in
imagination
to
the
place
where
he
was
born
and
to
recount
the
scenes
of
his
youth
during
those
stirring
times
when
the
nation
was
in
arms
he
had
been
athletic
and
more
keen
and
powerful
than
the
generality
of
his
race
but
now
his
eye
had
become
dim
and
his
natural
force
abated
very
often
indeed
while
discussing
the
best
method
of
baking
the
or
expatiating
at
large
upon
the
glory
of
jackson
he
would
forget
where
he
left
his
hat
or
his
hoe
or
his
basket
and
then
would
the
old
man
be
laughed
at
if
epps
was
absent
and
whipped
if
he
was
present
so
was
he
perplexed
continually
and
sighed
to
think
that
he
was
growing
aged
and
going
to
decay
philosophy
and
jackson
and
forgetfulness
had
played
the
mischief
with
him
and
it
was
evident
that
all
of
them
combined
were
fast
bringing
down
the
gray
hairs
of
uncle
abram
to
the
grave
aunt
phebe
had
been
an
excellent
field
hand
but
latterly
was
put
into
the
kitchen
where
she
remained
except
occasionally
in
a
time
of
uncommon
hurry
she
was
a
sly
old
creature
and
when
not
in
the
presence
of
her
mistress
or
her
master
was
garrulous
in
the
extreme
wiley
on
the
contrary
was
silent
he
performed
his
task
without
murmur
or
complaint
seldom
indulging
in
the
luxury
of
speech
except
to
utter
a
wish
that
he
was
away
from
epps
and
back
once
more
in
south
carolina
bob
and
henry
had
reached
the
ages
of
twenty
and
and
were
distinguished
for
nothing
extraordinary
or
unusual
while
edward
a
lad
of
thirteen
not
yet
able
to
maintain
his
row
in
the
corn
or
the
cotton
field
was
kept
in
the
great
house
to
wait
on
the
little
eppses
patsey
was
slim
and
straight
she
stood
erect
as
the
human
form
is
capable
of
standing
there
was
an
air
of
loftiness
in
her
movement
that
neither
labor
nor
weariness
nor
punishment
could
destroy
truly
patsey
was
a
splendid
animal
and
were
it
not
that
bondage
had
enshrouded
her
intellect
in
utter
and
everlasting
darkness
would
have
been
chief
among
ten
thousand
of
her
people
she
could
leap
the
highest
fences
and
a
fleet
hound
it
was
indeed
that
could
outstrip
her
in
a
race
no
horse
could
fling
her
from
his
back
she
was
a
skillful
teamster
she
turned
as
true
a
furrow
as
the
best
and
at
splitting
rails
there
were
none
who
could
excel
her
when
the
order
to
halt
was
heard
at
night
she
would
have
her
mules
at
the
crib
unharnessed
fed
and
curried
before
uncle
abram
had
found
his
hat
not
however
for
all
or
any
of
these
was
she
chiefly
famous
such
motion
was
in
her
fingers
as
no
other
fingers
ever
possessed
and
therefore
it
was
that
in
cotton
picking
time
patsey
was
queen
of
the
field
she
had
a
genial
and
pleasant
temper
and
was
faithful
and
obedient
naturally
she
was
a
joyous
creature
a
laughing
girl
rejoicing
in
the
mere
sense
of
existence
yet
patsey
wept
oftener
and
suffered
more
than
any
of
her
companions
she
had
been
literally
excoriated
her
back
bore
the
scars
of
a
thousand
stripes
not
because
she
was
backward
in
her
work
nor
because
she
was
of
an
unmindful
and
rebellious
spirit
but
because
it
had
fallen
to
her
lot
to
be
the
slave
of
a
licentious
master
and
a
jealous
mistress
she
shrank
before
the
lustful
eye
of
the
one
and
was
in
danger
even
of
her
life
at
the
hands
of
the
other
and
between
the
two
she
was
indeed
accursed
in
the
great
house
for
days
together
there
were
high
and
angry
words
poutings
and
estrangement
whereof
she
was
the
innocent
cause
nothing
delighted
the
mistress
so
much
as
to
see
her
suffer
and
more
than
once
when
epps
had
refused
to
sell
her
has
she
tempted
me
with
bribes
to
put
her
secretly
to
death
and
bury
her
body
in
some
lonely
place
in
the
margin
of
the
swamp
gladly
would
patsey
have
appeased
this
unforgiving
spirit
if
it
had
been
in
her
power
but
not
like
joseph
dared
she
escape
from
master
epps
leaving
her
garment
in
his
hand
patsey
walked
under
a
cloud
if
she
uttered
a
word
in
opposition
to
her
master
will
the
lash
was
resorted
to
at
once
to
bring
her
to
subjection
if
she
was
not
watchful
when
about
her
cabin
or
when
walking
in
the
yard
a
billet
of
wood
or
a
broken
bottle
perhaps
hurled
from
her
mistress
hand
would
smite
her
unexpectedly
in
the
face
the
enslaved
victim
of
lust
and
hate
patsey
had
no
comfort
of
her
life
these
were
my
companions
and
with
whom
i
was
accustomed
to
be

whom
it

the

almost
totally
destroyed
the

throughout
that
region
there
was
little
to
be
done
so
that
the
slaves
were
necessarily
idle
half
the
time
however
there
came
a
rumor
to
bayou
boeuf
that
wages
were
high
and
laborers
in
great
demand
on
the
sugar
plantations
in
mary
parish
this
parish
is
situated
on
the
coast
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
about
one
hundred
and
forty
miles
from
avoyelles
the
rio
teche
a
considerable
stream
flows
through
mary
to
the
gulf
it
was
determined
by
the
planters
on
the
receipt
of
this
intelligence
to
make
up
a
drove
of
slaves
to
be
sent
down
to
tuckapaw
in
mary
for
the
purpose
of
hiring
them
out
in
the
cane
fields
accordingly
in
the
month
of
september
there
were
one
hundred
and
collected
at
holmesville
abram
bob
and
myself
among
the
number
of
these
about
were
women
epps
alonson
pierce
henry
toler
and
addison
roberts
were
the
white
men
selected
to
accompany
and
take
charge
of
the
drove
they
had
a
carriage
and
two
saddle
horses
for
their
use
a
large
wagon
drawn
by
four
horses
and
driven
by
john
a
boy
belonging
to
roberts
carried
the
blankets
and
provisions
about
in
the
afternoon
having
been
fed
preparations
were
made
to
depart
the
duty
assigned
me
was
to
take
charge
of
the
blankets
and
provisions
and
see
that
none
were
lost
by
the
way
the
carriage
proceeded
in
advance
the
wagon
following
behind
this
the
slaves
were
arranged
while
the
two
horsemen
brought
up
the
rear
and
in
this
order
the
procession
moved
out
of
holmesville
that
night
we
reached
a
mccrow
plantation
a
distance
of
ten
or
fifteen
miles
when
we
were
ordered
to
halt
large
fires
were
built
and
each
one
spreading
his
blanket
on
the
ground
laid
down
upon
it
the
white
men
lodged
in
the
great
house
an
hour
before
day
we
were
aroused
by
the
drivers
coming
among
us
cracking
their
whips
and
ordering
us
to
arise
then
the
blankets
were
rolled
up
and
being
severally
delivered
to
me
and
deposited
in
the
wagon
the
procession
set
forth
again
the
following
night
it
rained
violently
we
were
all
drenched
our
clothes
saturated
with
mud
and
water
reaching
an
open
shed
formerly
a
we
found
beneath
it
such
shelter
as
it
afforded
there
was
not
room
for
all
of
us
to
lay
down
there
we
remained
huddled
together
through
the
night
continuing
our
march
as
usual
in
the
morning
during
the
journey
we
were
fed
twice
a
day
boiling
our
bacon
and
baking
our
at
the
fires
in
the
same
manner
as
in
our
huts
we
passed
through
lafayetteville
mountsville
to
centreville
where
bob
and
uncle
abram
were
hired
our
number
decreased
as
we
advanced
nearly
every
sugar
plantation
requiring
the
services
of
one
or
more
on
our
route
we
passed
the
grand
coteau
or
prairie
a
vast
space
of
level
monotonous
country
without
a
tree
except
an
occasional
one
which
had
been
transplanted
near
some
dilapidated
dwelling
it
was
once
thickly
populated
and
under
cultivation
but
for
some
cause
had
been
abandoned
the
business
of
the
scattered
inhabitants
that
now
dwell
upon
it
is
principally
raising
cattle
immense
herds
were
feeding
upon
it
as
we
passed
in
the
centre
of
the
grand
coteau
one
feels
as
if
he
were
on
the
ocean
out
of
sight
of
land
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
in
all
directions
it
is
but
a
ruined
and
deserted
waste
i
was
hired
to
judge
turner
a
distinguished
man
and
extensive
planter
whose
large
estate
is
situated
on
bayou
salle
within
a
few
miles
of
the
gulf
bay
on
salle
is
a
small
stream
flowing
into
the
bay
of
atchafalaya
for
some
days
i
was
employed
at
turner
in
repairing
his
sugar
house
when
a
cane
knife
was
put
into
my
hand
and
with
thirty
or
forty
others
i
was
sent
into
the
field
i
found
no
such
difficulty
in
learning
the
art
of
cutting
cane
that
i
had
in
picking
cotton
it
came
to
me
naturally
and
intuitively
and
in
a
short
time
i
was
able
to
keep
up
with
the
fastest
knife
before
the
cutting
was
over
however
judge
turner
transferred
me
from
the
field
to
the
sugar
house
to
act
there
in
the
capacity
of
driver
from
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
sugar
making
to
the
close
the
grinding
and
boiling
does
not
cease
day
or
night
the
whip
was
given
me
with
directions
to
use
it
upon
any
one
who
was
caught
standing
idle
if
i
failed
to
obey
them
to
the
letter
there
was
another
one
for
my
own
back
in
addition
to
this
my
duty
was
to
call
on
and
off
the
different
gangs
at
the
proper
time
i
had
no
regular
periods
of
rest
and
could
never
snatch
but
a
few
moments
of
sleep
at
a
time
it
is
the
custom
in
louisiana
as
i
presume
it
is
in
other
slave
states
to
allow
the
slave
to
retain
whatever
compensation
he
may
obtain
for
services
performed
on
sundays
in
this
way
only
are
they
able
to
provide
themselves
with
any
luxury
or
convenience
whatever
when
a
slave
purchased
or
kidnapped
in
the
north
is
transported
to
a
cabin
on
bayou
boeuf
he
is
furnished
with
neither
knife
nor
fork
nor
dish
nor
kettle
nor
any
other
thing
in
the
shape
of
crockery
or
furniture
of
any
nature
or
description
he
is
furnished
with
a
blanket
before
he
reaches
there
and
wrapping
that
around
him
he
can
either
stand
up
or
lie
down
upon
the
ground
or
on
a
board
if
his
master
has
no
use
for
it
he
is
at
liberty
to
find
a
gourd
in
which
to
keep
his
meal
or
he
can
eat
his
corn
from
the
cob
just
as
he
pleases
to
ask
the
master
for
a
knife
or
skillet
or
any
small
convenience
of
the
kind
would
be
answered
with
a
kick
or
laughed
at
as
a
joke
whatever
necessary
article
of
this
nature
is
found
in
a
cabin
has
been
purchased
with
sunday
money
however
injurious
to
the
morals
it
is
certainly
a
blessing
to
the
physical
condition
of
the
slave
to
be
permitted
to
break
the
sabbath
otherwise
there
would
be
no
way
to
provide
himself
with
any
utensils
which
seem
to
be
indispensable
to
him
who
is
compelled
to
be
his
own
cook
on
cane
plantations
in
sugar
time
there
is
no
distinction
as
to
the
days
of
the
week
it
is
well
understood
that
all
hands
must
labor
on
the
sabbath
and
it
is
equally
well
understood
that
those
especially
who
are
hired
as
i
was
to
judge
turner
and
others
in
succeeding
years
shall
receive
remuneration
for
it
it
is
usual
also
in
the
most
hurrying
time
of
to
require
the
same
extra
service
from
this
source
slaves
generally
are
afforded
an
opportunity
of
earning
sufficient
to
purchase
a
knife
a
kettle
tobacco
and
so
forth
the
females
discarding
the
latter
luxury
are
apt
to
expend
their
little
revenue
in
the
purchase
of
gaudy
ribbons
wherewithal
to
deck
their
hair
in
the
merry
season
of
the
holidays
i
remained
in
mary
until
the
first
of
january
during
which
time
my
sunday
money
amounted
to
ten
dollars
i
met
with
other
good
fortune
for
which
i
was
indebted
to
my
violin
my
constant
companion
the
source
of
profit
and
soother
of
my
sorrows
during
years
of
servitude
there
was
a
grand
party
of
whites
assembled
at
yarney
in
centreville
a
hamlet
in
the
vicinity
of
plantation
i
was
employed
to
play
for
them
and
so
well
pleased
were
the
with
my
performance
that
a
contribution
was
taken
for
my
benefit
which
amounted
to
seventeen
dollars
with
this
sum
in
possession
i
was
looked
upon
by
my
fellows
as
a
millionaire
it
afforded
me
great
pleasure
to
look
at
it
to
count
it
over
and
over
again
day
after
day
visions
of
cabin
furniture
of
water
pails
of
pocket
knives
new
shoes
and
coats
and
hats
floated
through
my
fancy
and
up
through
all
rose
the
triumphant
contemplation
that
i
was
the
wealthiest
nigger
on
bayou
boeuf
vessels
run
up
the
rio
teche
to
centreville
while
there
i
was
bold
enough
one
day
to
present
myself
before
the
captain
of
a
steamer
and
beg
permission
to
hide
myself
among
the
freight
i
was
emboldened
to
risk
the
hazard
of
such
a
step
from
overhearing
a
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
i
ascertained
he
was
a
native
of
the
north
i
did
not
relate
to
him
the
particulars
of
my
history
but
only
expressed
an
ardent
desire
to
escape
from
slavery
to
a
free
state
he
pitied
me
but
said
it
would
be
impossible
to
avoid
the
vigilant
custom
house
officers
in
and
that
detection
would
subject
him
to
punishment
and
his
vessel
to
confiscation
my
earnest
entreaties
evidently
excited
his
sympathies
and
doubtless
he
would
have
yielded
to
them
could
he
have
done
so
with
any
kind
of
safety
i
was
compelled
to
smother
the
sudden
flame
that
lighted
up
my
bosom
with
sweet
hopes
of
liberation
and
turn
my
steps
once
more
towards
the
increasing
darkness
of
despair
immediately
after
this
event
the
drove
assembled
at
centreville
and
several
of
the
owners
having
arrived
and
collected
the
monies
due
for
our
services
we
were
driven
back
to
bayou
boeuf
it
was
on
our
return
while
passing
through
a
small
village
that
i
caught
sight
of
tibeats
seated
in
the
door
of
a
dirty
grocery
looking
somewhat
seedy
and
out
of
repair
passion
and
poor
whisky
i
doubt
not
have
ere
this
laid
him
on
the
shelf
during
our
absence
i
learned
from
aunt
phebe
and
patsey
that
the
latter
had
been
getting
deeper
and
deeper
into
trouble
the
poor
girl
was
truly
an
object
of
pity
old
hogjaw
the
name
by
which
epps
was
called
when
the
slaves
were
by
themselves
had
beaten
her
more
severely
and
frequently
than
ever
as
surely
as
he
came
from
holmesville
elated
with
liquor
and
it
was
often
in
those
days
he
would
whip
her
merely
to
gratify
the
mistress
would
punish
her
to
an
extent
almost
beyond
endurance
for
an
offence
of
which
he
himself
was
the
sole
and
irresistible
cause
in
his
sober
moments
he
could
not
always
be
prevailed
upon
to
indulge
his
wife
insatiable
thirst
for
vengeance
to
be
rid
of
patsey
to
place
her
beyond
sight
or
reach
by
sale
or
death
or
in
any
other
manner
of
late
years
seemed
to
be
the
ruling
thought
and
passion
of
my
mistress
patsey
had
been
a
favorite
when
a
child
even
in
the
great
house
she
had
been
petted
and
admired
for
her
uncommon
sprightliness
and
pleasant
disposition
she
had
been
fed
many
a
time
so
uncle
abram
said
even
on
biscuit
and
milk
when
the
madam
in
her
younger
days
was
wont
to
call
her
to
the
piazza
and
fondle
her
as
she
would
a
playful
kitten
but
a
sad
change
had
come
over
the
spirit
of
the
woman
now
only
black
and
angry
fiends
ministered
in
the
temple
of
her
heart
until
she
could
look
on
patsey
but
with
concentrated
venom
mistress
epps
was
not
naturally
such
an
evil
woman
after
all
she
was
possessed
of
the
devil
jealousy
it
is
true
but
aside
from
that
there
was
much
in
her
character
to
admire
her
father
roberts
resided
in
cheneyville
an
influential
and
honorable
man
and
as
much
respected
throughout
the
parish
as
any
other
citizen
she
had
been
well
educated
at
some
institution
this
side
the
mississippi
was
beautiful
accomplished
and
usually
she
was
kind
to
all
of
us
but
patsey
frequently
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
sending
out
to
us
some
little
dainty
from
her
own
table
in
other
situations
in
a
different
society
from
that
which
exists
on
the
shores
of
bayou
boeuf
she
would
have
been
pronounced
an
elegant
and
fascinating
woman
an
ill
wind
it
was
that
blew
her
into
the
arms
of
epps
he
respected
and
loved
his
wife
as
much
as
a
coarse
nature
like
his
is
capable
of
loving
but
supreme
selfishness
always
overmastered
conjugal
affection
he
loved
as
well
as
baser
natures
can
but
a
mean
heart
and
soul
were
in
that
man
he
was
ready
to
gratify
any
whim
to
grant
any
request
she
made
provided
it
did
not
cost
too
much
patsey
was
equal
to
any
two
of
his
slaves
in
the
cotton
field
he
could
not
replace
her
with
the
same
money
she
would
bring
the
idea
of
disposing
of
her
therefore
could
not
be
entertained
the
mistress
did
not
regard
her
at
all
in
that
light
the
pride
of
the
haughty
woman
was
aroused
the
blood
of
the
fiery
southern
boiled
at
the
sight
of
patsey
and
nothing
less
than
trampling
out
the
life
of
the
helpless
bondwoman
would
satisfy
her
sometimes
the
current
of
her
wrath
turned
upon
him
whom
she
had
just
cause
to
hate
but
the
storm
of
angry
words
would
pass
over
at
length
and
there
would
be
a
season
of
calm
again
at
such
times
patsey
trembled
with
fear
and
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
for
she
knew
from
painful
experience
that
if
mistress
should
work
herself
to
the
pitch
of
rage
epps
would
quiet
her
at
last
with
a
promise
that
patsey
should
be
flogged
a
promise
he
was
sure
to
keep
thus
did
pride
and
jealousy
and
vengeance
war
with
avarice
and
in
the
mansion
of
my
master
filling
it
with
daily
tumult
and
contention
thus
upon
the
head
of
patsey
the
slave
in
whose
heart
god
had
implanted
the
seeds
of
virtue
the
force
of
all
these
domestic
tempests
spent
itself
at
last
during
the
summer
succeeding
my
return
from
mary
parish
i
conceived
a
plan
of
providing
myself
with
food
which
though
simple
succeeded
beyond
expectation
it
has
been
followed
by
many
others
in
my
condition
up
and
down
the
bayou
and
of
such
benefit
has
it
become
that
i
am
almost
persuaded
to
look
upon
myself
as
a
benefactor
that
summer
the
worms
got
into
the
bacon
nothing
but
ravenous
hunger
could
induce
us
to
swallow
it
the
weekly
allowance
of
meal
scarcely
sufficed
to
satisfy
us
it
was
customary
with
us
as
it
is
with
all
in
that
region
where
the
allowance
is
exhausted
before
saturday
night
or
is
in
such
a
state
as
to
render
it
nauseous
and
disgusting
to
hunt
in
the
swamps
for
coon
and
opossum
this
however
must
be
done
at
night
after
the
day
work
is
accomplished
there
are
planters
whose
slaves
for
months
at
a
time
have
no
other
meat
than
such
as
is
obtained
in
this
manner
no
objections
are
made
to
hunting
inasmuch
as
it
dispenses
with
drafts
upon
the
and
because
every
marauding
coon
that
is
killed
is
so
much
saved
from
the
standing
corn
they
are
hunted
with
dogs
and
clubs
slaves
not
being
allowed
the
use
of
the
flesh
of
the
coon
is
palatable
but
verily
there
is
nothing
in
all
butcherdom
so
delicious
as
a
roasted
they
are
a
round
rather
little
animal
of
a
whitish
color
with
nose
like
a
pig
and
caudal
extremity
like
a
rat
they
burrow
among
the
roots
and
in
the
hollows
of
the
gum
tree
and
are
clumsy
and
slow
of
motion
they
are
deceitful
and
cunning
creatures
on
receiving
the
slightest
tap
of
a
stick
they
will
roll
over
on
the
ground
and
feign
death
if
the
hunter
leaves
him
in
pursuit
of
another
without
first
taking
particular
pains
to
break
his
neck
the
chances
are
on
his
return
he
is
not
to
be
found
the
little
animal
has
out
witted
the
enemy
has
played
and
is
off
but
after
a
long
and
hard
day
work
the
weary
slave
feels
little
like
going
to
the
swamp
for
his
supper
and
half
the
time
prefers
throwing
himself
on
the
cabin
floor
without
it
it
is
for
the
interest
of
the
master
that
the
servant
should
not
suffer
in
health
from
starvation
and
it
is
also
for
his
interest
that
he
should
not
become
gross
from
in
the
estimation
of
the
owner
a
slave
is
the
most
serviceable
when
in
rather
a
lean
and
lank
condition
such
a
condition
as
the
is
in
when
fitted
for
the
course
and
in
that
condition
they
are
generally
to
be
found
on
the
sugar
and
cotton
plantations
along
red
river
my
cabin
was
within
a
few
rods
of
the
bayou
bank
and
necessity
being
indeed
the
mother
of
invention
i
resolved
upon
a
mode
of
obtaining
the
requisite
amount
of
food
without
the
trouble
of
resorting
nightly
to
the
woods
this
was
to
construct
a
fish
trap
having
in
my
mind
conceived
the
manner
in
which
it
could
be
done
the
next
sunday
i
set
about
putting
it
into
practical
execution
it
may
be
impossible
for
me
to
convey
to
the
reader
a
full
and
correct
idea
of
its
construction
but
the
following
will
serve
as
a
general
description
a
frame
between
two
and
three
feet
square
is
made
and
of
a
greater
or
less
height
according
to
the
depth
of
water
boards
or
slats
are
nailed
on
three
sides
of
this
frame
not
so
closely
however
as
to
prevent
the
water
circulating
freely
through
it
a
door
is
fitted
into
the
fourth
side
in
such
manner
that
it
will
slide
easily
up
and
down
in
the
grooves
cut
in
the
two
posts
a
movable
bottom
is
then
so
fitted
that
it
can
be
raised
to
the
top
of
the
frame
without
difficulty
in
the
centre
of
the
movable
bottom
an
auger
hole
is
bored
and
into
this
one
end
of
a
handle
or
round
stick
is
fastened
on
the
under
side
so
loosely
that
it
will
turn
the
handle
ascends
from
the
centre
of
the
movable
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
frame
or
as
much
higher
as
is
desirable
up
and
down
this
handle
in
a
great
many
places
are
gimlet
holes
through
which
small
sticks
are
inserted
extending
to
opposite
sides
of
the
frame
so
many
of
these
small
sticks
are
running
out
from
the
handle
in
all
directions
that
a
fish
of
any
considerable
dimensions
can
not
pass
through
without
hitting
one
of
them
the
frame
is
then
placed
in
the
water
and
made
stationary
the
trap
is
set
by
sliding
or
drawing
up
the
door
and
kept
in
that
position
by
another
stick
one
end
of
which
rests
in
a
notch
on
the
inner
side
the
other
end
in
a
notch
made
in
the
handle
running
up
from
the
centre
of
the
movable
bottom
the
trap
is
baited
by
rolling
a
handful
of
wet
meal
and
cotton
together
until
it
becomes
hard
and
depositing
it
in
the
back
part
of
the
frame
a
fish
swimming
through
the
upraised
door
towards
the
bait
necessarily
strikes
one
of
the
small
sticks
turning
the
handle
which
displacing
the
stick
supporting
the
door
the
latter
falls
securing
the
fish
within
the
frame
taking
hold
of
the
top
of
the
handle
the
movable
bottom
is
then
drawn
up
to
the
surface
of
the
water
and
the
fish
taken
out
there
may
have
been
other
such
traps
in
use
before
mine
was
constructed
but
if
there
were
i
had
never
happened
to
see
one
bayou
boeuf
abounds
in
fish
of
large
size
and
excellent
quality
and
after
this
time
i
was
very
rarely
in
want
of
one
for
myself
or
for
my
comrades
thus
a
mine
was
opened
a
new
resource
was
developed
hitherto
unthought
of
by
the
enslaved
children
of
africa
who
toil
and
hunger
along
the
shores
of
that
sluggish
but
prolific
stream
about
the
time
of
which
i
am
now
writing
an
event
occurred
in
our
immediate
neighborhood
which
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me
and
which
shows
the
state
of
society
existing
there
and
the
manner
in
which
affronts
are
oftentimes
avenged
directly
opposite
our
quarters
on
the
other
side
of
the
bayou
was
situated
the
plantation
of
marshall
he
belonged
to
a
family
among
the
most
wealthy
and
aristocratic
in
the
country
a
gentleman
from
the
vicinity
of
natchez
had
been
negotiating
with
him
for
the
purchase
of
the
estate
one
day
a
messenger
came
in
great
haste
to
our
plantation
saying
that
a
bloody
and
fearful
battle
was
going
on
at
marshall
that
blood
had
been
spilled
and
unless
the
combatants
were
forthwith
separated
the
result
would
be
disastrous
on
repairing
to
marshall
house
a
scene
presented
itself
that
beggars
description
on
the
floor
of
one
of
the
rooms
lay
the
ghastly
corpse
of
the
man
from
natchez
while
marshall
enraged
and
covered
with
wounds
and
blood
was
stalking
back
and
forth
breathing
out
threatenings
and
slaughter
a
difficulty
had
arisen
in
the
course
of
their
negotiation
high
words
ensued
when
drawing
their
weapons
the
deadly
strife
began
that
ended
so
unfortunately
marshall
was
never
placed
in
confinement
a
sort
of
trial
or
investigation
was
had
at
marksville
when
he
was
acquitted
and
returned
to
his
plantation
rather
more
respected
as
i
thought
than
ever
from
the
fact
that
the
blood
of
a
fellow
being
was
on
his
soul
epps
interested
himself
in
his
behalf
accompanying
him
to
marksville
and
on
all
occasions
loudly
justifying
him
but
his
services
in
this
respect
did
not
afterwards
deter
a
kinsman
of
this
same
marshall
from
seeking
his
life
also
a
brawl
occurred
between
them
over
a
which
terminated
in
a
deadly
feud
riding
up
on
horseback
in
front
of
the
house
one
day
armed
with
pistols
and
bowie
knife
marshall
challenged
him
to
come
forth
and
make
a
final
settlement
of
the
quarrel
or
he
would
brand
him
as
a
coward
and
shoot
him
like
a
dog
the
first
opportunity
not
through
cowardice
nor
from
any
conscientious
scruples
in
my
opinion
but
through
the
influence
of
his
wife
he
was
restrained
from
accepting
the
challenge
of
his
enemy
a
reconciliation
however
was
effected
afterward
since
which
time
they
have
been
on
terms
of
the
closest
intimacy
such
occurrences
which
would
bring
upon
the
parties
concerned
in
them
merited
and
condign
punishment
in
the
northern
states
are
frequent
on
the
bayou
and
pass
without
notice
and
almost
without
comment
every
man
carries
his
bowie
knife
and
when
two
fall
out
they
set
to
work
hacking
and
thrusting
at
each
other
more
like
savages
than
civilized
and
enlightened
beings
the
existence
of
slavery
in
its
most
cruel
form
among
them
has
a
tendency
to
brutalize
the
humane
and
finer
feelings
of
their
nature
daily
witnesses
of
human
suffering
listening
to
the
agonizing
screeches
of
the
slave
beholding
him
writhing
beneath
the
merciless
lash
bitten
and
torn
by
dogs
dying
without
attention
and
buried
without
shroud
or
coffin
it
can
not
otherwise
be
expected
than
that
they
should
become
brutified
and
reckless
of
human
life
it
is
true
there
are
many
and
good
men
in
the
parish
of
avoyelles
such
men
as
william
ford
who
can
look
with
pity
upon
the
sufferings
of
a
slave
just
as
there
are
over
all
the
world
sensitive
and
sympathetic
spirits
who
can
not
look
with
indifference
upon
the
sufferings
of
any
creature
which
the
almighty
has
endowed
with
life
it
is
not
the
fault
of
the
slaveholder
that
he
is
cruel
so
much
as
it
is
the
fault
of
the
system
under
which
he
lives
he
can
not
withstand
the
influence
of
habit
and
associations
that
surround
him
taught
from
earliest
childhood
by
all
that
he
sees
and
hears
that
the
rod
is
for
the
slave
back
he
will
not
be
apt
to
change
his
opinions
in
maturer
years
there
may
be
humane
masters
as
there
certainly
are
inhuman
ones
there
may
be
slaves
and
happy
as
there
surely
are
those
and
miserable
nevertheless
the
institution
that
tolerates
such
wrong
and
inhumanity
as
i
have
witnessed
is
a
cruel
unjust
and
barbarous
one
men
may
write
fictions
portraying
lowly
life
as
it
is
or
as
it
is
not
may
expatiate
with
owlish
gravity
upon
the
bliss
of
ignorance
discourse
flippantly
from
arm
chairs
of
the
pleasures
of
slave
life
but
let
them
toil
with
him
in
the
field
sleep
with
him
in
the
cabin
feed
with
him
on
husks
let
them
behold
him
scourged
hunted
trampled
on
and
they
will
come
back
with
another
story
in
their
mouths
let
them
know
the
of
the
poor
slave
learn
his
secret
thoughts
thoughts
he
dare
not
utter
in
the
hearing
of
the
white
man
let
them
sit
by
him
in
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
converse
with
him
in
trustful
confidence
of
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
they
will
find
that
out
of
every
hundred
are
intelligent
enough
to
understand
their
situation
and
to
cherish
in
their
bosoms
the
love
of
freedom
as
passionately
as
themselves

successive
years
i
held
the

at
hawkins
leading
a
gang
of
from
fifty
to
an
hundred
hands
in
a
previous
chapter
the
mode
of
cultivating
cotton
is
described
this
may
be
the
proper
place
to
speak
of
the
manner
of
cultivating
cane
the
ground
is
prepared
in
beds
the
same
as
it
is
prepared
for
the
reception
of
the
cotton
seed
except
it
is
ploughed
deeper
drills
are
made
in
the
same
manner
planting
commences
in
january
and
continues
until
april
it
is
necessary
to
plant
a
sugar
field
only
once
in
three
years
three
crops
are
taken
before
the
seed
or
plant
is
exhausted
three
gangs
are
employed
in
the
operation
one
draws
the
cane
from
the
rick
or
stack
cutting
the
top
and
flags
from
the
stalk
leaving
only
that
part
which
is
sound
and
healthy
each
joint
of
the
cane
has
an
eye
like
the
eye
of
a
potato
which
sends
forth
a
sprout
when
buried
in
the
soil
another
gang
lays
the
cane
in
the
drill
placing
two
stalks
side
by
side
in
such
manner
that
joints
will
occur
once
in
four
or
six
inches
the
third
gang
follows
with
hoes
drawing
earth
upon
the
stalks
and
covering
them
to
the
depth
of
three
inches
in
four
weeks
at
the
farthest
the
sprouts
appear
above
the
ground
and
from
this
time
forward
grow
with
great
rapidity
a
sugar
field
is
hoed
three
times
the
same
as
cotton
save
that
a
greater
quantity
of
earth
is
drawn
to
the
roots
by
the
first
of
august
hoeing
is
usually
over
about
the
middle
of
september
whatever
is
required
for
seed
is
cut
and
stacked
in
ricks
as
they
are
termed
in
october
it
is
ready
for
the
mill
or
and
then
the
general
cutting
begins
the
blade
of
a
is
fifteen
inches
long
three
inches
wide
in
the
middle
and
tapering
towards
the
point
and
handle
the
blade
is
thin
and
in
order
to
be
at
all
serviceable
must
be
kept
very
sharp
every
third
hand
takes
the
lead
of
two
others
one
of
whom
is
on
each
side
of
him
the
lead
hand
in
the
first
place
with
a
blow
of
his
knife
shears
the
flags
from
the
stalk
he
next
cuts
off
the
top
down
as
far
as
it
is
green
he
must
be
careful
to
sever
all
the
green
from
the
ripe
part
inasmuch
as
the
juice
of
the
former
sours
the
molasses
and
renders
it
unsalable
then
he
severs
the
stalk
at
the
root
and
lays
it
directly
behind
him
his
right
and
left
hand
companions
lay
their
stalks
when
cut
in
the
same
manner
upon
his
to
every
three
hands
there
is
a
cart
which
follows
and
the
stalks
are
thrown
into
it
by
the
younger
slaves
when
it
is
drawn
to
the
and
ground
if
the
planter
apprehends
a
frost
the
cane
is
winrowed
winrowing
is
the
cutting
the
stalks
at
an
early
period
and
throwing
them
lengthwise
in
the
water
furrow
in
such
a
manner
that
the
tops
will
cover
the
butts
of
the
stalks
they
will
remain
in
this
condition
three
weeks
or
a
month
without
souring
and
secure
from
frost
when
the
proper
time
arrives
they
are
taken
up
trimmed
and
carted
to
the
in
the
month
of
january
the
slaves
enter
the
field
again
to
prepare
for
another
crop
the
ground
is
now
strewn
with
the
tops
and
flags
cut
from
the
past
year
cane
on
a
dry
day
fire
is
set
to
this
combustible
refuse
which
sweeps
over
the
field
leaving
it
bare
and
clean
and
ready
for
the
hoes
the
earth
is
loosened
about
the
roots
of
the
old
stubble
and
in
process
of
time
another
crop
springs
up
from
the
last
year
seed
it
is
the
same
the
year
following
but
the
third
year
the
seed
has
exhausted
its
strength
and
the
field
must
be
ploughed
and
planted
again
the
second
year
the
cane
is
sweeter
and
yields
more
than
the
first
and
the
third
year
more
than
the
second
during
the
three
seasons
i
labored
on
hawkins
plantation
i
was
employed
a
considerable
portion
of
the
time
in
the
he
is
celebrated
as
the
producer
of
the
finest
variety
of
white
sugar
the
following
is
a
general
description
of
his
and
the
process
of
manufacture
the
mill
is
an
immense
brick
building
standing
on
the
shore
of
the
bayou
running
out
from
the
building
is
an
open
shed
at
least
an
hundred
feet
in
length
and
forty
or
fifty
feet
in
width
the
boiler
in
which
the
steam
is
generated
is
situated
outside
the
main
building
the
machinery
and
engine
rest
on
a
brick
pier
fifteen
feet
above
the
floor
within
the
body
of
the
building
the
machinery
turns
two
great
iron
rollers
between
two
and
three
feet
in
diameter
and
six
or
eight
feet
in
length
they
are
elevated
above
the
brick
pier
and
roll
in
towards
each
other
an
endless
carrier
made
of
chain
and
wood
like
leathern
belts
used
in
small
mills
extends
from
the
iron
rollers
out
of
the
main
building
and
through
the
entire
length
of
the
open
shed
the
carts
in
which
the
cane
is
brought
from
the
field
as
fast
as
it
is
cut
are
unloaded
at
the
sides
of
the
shed
all
along
the
endless
carrier
are
ranged
slave
children
whose
business
it
is
to
place
the
cane
upon
it
when
it
is
conveyed
through
the
shed
into
the
main
building
where
it
falls
between
the
rollers
is
crushed
and
drops
upon
another
carrier
that
conveys
it
out
of
the
main
building
in
an
opposite
direction
depositing
it
in
the
top
of
a
chimney
upon
a
fire
beneath
which
consumes
it
it
is
necessary
to
burn
it
in
this
manner
because
otherwise
it
would
soon
fill
the
building
and
more
especially
because
it
would
soon
sour
and
engender
disease
the
juice
of
the
cane
falls
into
a
conductor
underneath
the
iron
rollers
and
is
carried
into
a
reservoir
pipes
convey
it
from
thence
into
five
filterers
holding
several
hogsheads
each
these
filterers
are
filled
with
a
substance
resembling
pulverized
charcoal
it
is
made
of
bones
calcinated
in
close
vessels
and
is
used
for
the
purpose
of
decolorizing
by
filtration
the
cane
juice
before
boiling
through
these
five
filterers
it
passes
in
succession
and
then
runs
into
a
large
reservoir
underneath
the
ground
floor
from
whence
it
is
carried
up
by
means
of
a
steam
pump
into
a
clarifier
made
of
sheet
iron
where
it
is
heated
by
steam
until
it
boils
from
the
first
clarifier
it
is
carried
in
pipes
to
a
second
and
a
third
and
thence
into
close
iron
pans
through
which
tubes
pass
filled
with
steam
while
in
a
boiling
state
it
flows
through
three
pans
in
succession
and
is
then
carried
in
other
pipes
down
to
the
coolers
on
the
ground
floor
coolers
are
wooden
boxes
with
sieve
bottoms
made
of
the
finest
wire
as
soon
as
the
syrup
passes
into
the
coolers
and
is
met
by
the
air
it
grains
and
the
molasses
at
once
escapes
through
the
sieves
into
a
cistern
below
it
is
then
white
or
loaf
sugar
of
the
finest
kind
clear
clean
and
as
white
as
snow
when
cool
it
is
taken
out
packed
in
hogsheads
and
is
ready
for
market
the
molasses
is
then
carried
from
the
cistern
into
the
upper
story
again
and
by
another
process
converted
into
brown
sugar
there
are
larger
mills
and
those
constructed
differently
from
the
one
thus
imperfectly
described
but
none
perhaps
more
celebrated
than
this
anywhere
on
bayou
boeuf
lambert
of
is
a
partner
of
hawkins
he
is
a
man
of
vast
wealth
holding
as
i
have
been
told
an
interest
in
over
forty
different
sugar
plantations
in
louisiana
the
only
respite
from
constant
labor
the
slave
has
through
the
whole
year
is
during
the
christmas
holidays
epps
allowed
us
three
others
allow
four
five
and
six
days
according
to
the
measure
of
their
generosity
it
is
the
only
time
to
which
they
look
forward
with
any
interest
or
pleasure
they
are
glad
when
night
comes
not
only
because
it
brings
them
a
few
hours
repose
but
because
it
brings
them
one
day
nearer
christmas
it
is
hailed
with
equal
delight
by
the
old
and
the
young
even
uncle
abram
ceases
to
glorify
andrew
jackson
and
patsey
forgets
her
many
sorrows
amid
the
general
hilarity
of
the
holidays
it
is
the
time
of
feasting
and
frolicking
and
fiddling
the
carnival
season
with
the
children
of
bondage
they
are
the
only
days
when
they
are
allowed
a
little
restricted
liberty
and
heartily
indeed
do
they
enjoy
it
it
is
the
custom
for
one
planter
to
give
a
christmas
supper
inviting
the
slaves
from
neighboring
plantations
to
join
his
own
on
the
occasion
for
instance
one
year
it
is
given
by
epps
the
next
by
marshall
the
next
by
hawkins
and
so
on
usually
from
three
to
five
hundred
are
assembled
coming
together
on
foot
in
carts
on
horseback
on
mules
riding
double
and
triple
sometimes
a
boy
and
girl
at
others
a
girl
and
two
boys
and
at
others
again
a
boy
a
girl
and
an
old
woman
uncle
abram
astride
a
mule
with
aunt
phebe
and
patsey
behind
him
trotting
towards
a
christmas
supper
would
be
no
uncommon
sight
on
bayou
boeuf
then
too
of
all
days
i
the
year
they
array
themselves
in
their
best
attire
the
cotton
coat
has
been
washed
clean
the
stump
of
a
tallow
candle
has
been
applied
to
the
shoes
and
if
so
fortunate
as
to
possess
a
rimless
or
a
crownless
hat
it
is
placed
jauntily
on
the
head
they
are
welcomed
with
equal
cordiality
however
if
they
come
and
barefooted
to
the
feast
as
a
general
thing
the
women
wear
handkerchiefs
tied
about
their
heads
but
if
chance
has
thrown
in
their
way
a
fiery
red
ribbon
or
a
bonnet
of
their
grandmother
it
is
sure
to
be
worn
on
such
occasions
red
the
deep
blood
red
is
decidedly
the
favorite
color
among
the
enslaved
damsels
of
my
acquaintance
if
a
red
ribbon
does
not
encircle
the
neck
you
will
be
certain
to
find
all
the
hair
of
their
woolly
heads
tied
up
with
red
strings
of
one
sort
or
another
the
table
is
spread
in
the
open
air
and
loaded
with
varieties
of
meat
and
piles
of
vegetables
bacon
and
corn
meal
at
such
times
are
dispensed
with
sometimes
the
cooking
is
performed
in
the
kitchen
on
the
plantation
at
others
in
the
shade
of
wide
branching
trees
in
the
latter
case
a
ditch
is
dug
in
the
ground
and
wood
laid
in
and
burned
until
it
is
filled
with
glowing
coals
over
which
chickens
ducks
turkeys
pigs
and
not
unfrequently
the
entire
body
of
a
wild
ox
are
roasted
they
are
furnished
also
with
flour
of
which
biscuits
are
made
and
often
with
peach
and
other
preserves
with
tarts
and
every
manner
and
description
of
pies
except
the
mince
that
being
an
article
of
pastry
as
yet
unknown
among
them
only
the
slave
who
has
lived
all
the
years
on
his
scanty
allowance
of
meal
and
bacon
can
appreciate
such
suppers
white
people
in
great
numbers
assemble
to
witness
the
gastronomical
enjoyments
they
seat
themselves
at
the
rustic
table
the
males
on
one
side
the
females
on
the
other
the
two
between
whom
there
may
have
been
an
exchange
of
tenderness
invariably
manage
to
sit
opposite
for
the
omnipresent
cupid
disdains
not
to
hurl
his
arrows
into
the
simple
hearts
of
slaves
unalloyed
and
exulting
happiness
lights
up
the
dark
faces
of
them
all
the
ivory
teeth
contrasting
with
their
black
complexions
exhibit
two
long
white
streaks
the
whole
extent
of
the
table
all
round
the
bountiful
board
a
multitude
of
eyes
roll
in
ecstacy
giggling
and
laughter
and
the
clattering
of
cutlery
and
crockery
succeed
cuffee
elbow
hunches
his
neighbor
side
impelled
by
an
involuntary
impulse
of
delight
nelly
shakes
her
finger
at
sambo
and
laughs
she
knows
not
why
and
so
the
fun
and
merriment
flows
on
when
the
viands
have
disappeared
and
the
hungry
maws
of
the
children
of
toil
are
satisfied
then
next
in
the
order
of
amusement
is
the
christmas
dance
my
business
on
these
gala
days
always
was
to
play
on
the
violin
the
african
race
is
a
one
proverbially
and
many
there
were
among
my
whose
organs
of
tune
were
strikingly
developed
and
who
could
thumb
the
banjo
with
dexterity
but
at
the
expense
of
appearing
egotistical
i
must
nevertheless
declare
that
i
was
considered
the
ole
bull
of
bayou
boeuf
my
master
often
received
letters
sometimes
from
a
distance
of
ten
miles
requesting
him
to
send
me
to
play
at
a
ball
or
festival
of
the
whites
he
received
his
compensation
and
usually
i
also
returned
with
many
picayunes
jingling
in
my
pockets
the
extra
contributions
of
those
to
whose
delight
i
had
administered
in
this
manner
i
became
more
acquainted
than
i
otherwise
would
up
and
down
the
bayou
the
young
men
and
maidens
of
holmesville
always
knew
there
was
to
be
a
jollification
somewhere
whenever
platt
epps
was
seen
passing
through
the
town
with
his
fiddle
in
his
hand
where
are
you
going
now
platt
and
what
is
coming
off
platt
would
be
interrogatories
issuing
from
every
door
and
window
and
many
a
time
when
there
was
no
special
hurry
yielding
to
pressing
importunities
platt
would
draw
his
bow
and
sitting
astride
his
mule
perhaps
discourse
musically
to
a
crowd
of
delighted
children
gathered
around
him
in
the
street
alas
had
it
not
been
for
my
beloved
violin
i
scarcely
can
conceive
how
i
could
have
endured
the
long
years
of
bondage
it
introduced
me
to
great
houses
relieved
me
of
many
days
labor
in
the
field
supplied
me
with
conveniences
for
my
cabin
with
pipes
and
tobacco
and
extra
pairs
of
shoes
and
oftentimes
led
me
away
from
the
presence
of
a
hard
master
to
witness
scenes
of
jollity
and
mirth
it
was
my
companion
the
friend
of
my
bosom
triumphing
loudly
when
i
was
joyful
and
uttering
its
soft
melodious
consolations
when
i
was
sad
often
at
midnight
when
sleep
had
fled
affrighted
from
the
cabin
and
my
soul
was
disturbed
and
troubled
with
the
contemplation
of
my
fate
it
would
sing
me
a
song
of
peace
on
holy
sabbath
days
when
an
hour
or
two
of
leisure
was
allowed
it
would
accompany
me
to
some
quiet
place
on
the
bayou
bank
and
lifting
up
its
voice
discourse
kindly
and
pleasantly
indeed
it
heralded
my
name
round
the
country
made
me
friends
who
otherwise
would
not
have
noticed
me
gave
me
an
honored
seat
at
the
yearly
feasts
and
secured
the
loudest
and
heartiest
welcome
of
them
all
at
the
christmas
dance
the
christmas
dance
oh
ye
sons
and
daughters
of
idleness
who
move
with
measured
step
listless
and
through
the
cotillon
if
ye
wish
to
look
upon
the
celerity
if
not
the
poetry
of
motion
upon
genuine
happiness
rampant
and
unrestrained
go
down
to
louisiana
and
see
the
slaves
dancing
in
the
starlight
of
a
christmas
night
on
that
particular
christmas
i
have
now
in
my
mind
a
description
whereof
will
serve
as
a
description
of
the
day
generally
miss
lively
and
sam
the
first
belonging
to
stewart
the
latter
to
roberts
started
the
ball
it
was
well
known
that
sam
cherished
an
ardent
passion
for
lively
as
also
did
one
of
marshall
and
another
of
carey
boys
for
lively
was
indeed
and
a
coquette
withal
it
was
a
victory
for
sam
roberts
when
rising
from
the
repast
she
gave
him
her
hand
for
the
first
figure
in
preference
to
either
of
his
rivals
they
were
somewhat
and
shaking
their
heads
angrily
rather
intimated
they
would
like
to
pitch
into
sam
and
hurt
him
badly
but
not
an
emotion
of
wrath
ruffled
the
placid
bosom
of
samuel
as
his
legs
flew
like
down
the
outside
and
up
the
middle
by
the
side
of
his
bewitching
partner
the
whole
company
cheered
them
vociferously
and
excited
with
the
applause
they
continued
tearing
down
after
all
the
others
had
become
exhausted
and
halted
a
moment
to
recover
breath
but
superhuman
exertions
overcame
him
finally
leaving
lively
alone
yet
whirling
like
a
top
thereupon
one
of
sam
rivals
pete
marshall
dashed
in
and
with
might
and
main
leaped
and
shuffled
and
threw
himself
into
every
conceivable
shape
as
if
determined
to
show
miss
lively
and
all
the
world
that
sam
roberts
was
of
no
account
pete
affection
however
was
greater
than
his
discretion
such
violent
exercise
took
the
breath
out
of
him
directly
and
he
dropped
like
an
empty
bag
then
was
the
time
for
harry
carey
to
try
his
hand
but
lively
also
soon
him
amidst
hurrahs
and
shouts
fully
sustaining
her
reputation
of
being
the
fastest
gal
on
the
bayou
one
set
off
another
takes
its
place
he
or
she
remaining
longest
on
the
floor
receiving
the
most
uproarious
commendation
and
so
the
dancing
continues
until
broad
daylight
it
does
not
cease
with
the
sound
of
the
fiddle
but
in
that
case
they
set
up
a
music
peculiar
to
themselves
this
is
called
patting
accompanied
with
one
of
those
unmeaning
songs
composed
rather
for
its
adaptation
to
a
certain
tune
or
measure
than
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
any
distinct
idea
the
patting
is
performed
by
striking
the
hands
on
the
knees
then
striking
the
hands
together
then
striking
the
right
shoulder
with
one
hand
the
left
with
the
other
all
the
while
keeping
time
with
the
feet
and
singing
perhaps
this
song
harper
creek

roarin
ribber

two

and
one
little
nigger
or
if
these
words
are
not
adapted
to
the
tune
called
for
it
may
be
that
old
hog
eye
a
rather
solemn
and
startling
specimen
of
versification
not
however
to
be
appreciated
unless
heard
at
the
south
it
runneth
as
follows
who

or
may
be

perhaps
equally
nonsensical
but
full
of
melody

as
it

during
the
remaining
holidays
succeeding
christmas
they
are
provided
with
passes
and
permitted
to
go
where
they
please
within
a
limited
distance
or
they
may
remain
and
labor
on
the
plantation
in
which
case
they
are
paid
for
it
it
is
very
rarely
however
that
the
latter
alternative
is
accepted
they
may
be
seen
at
these
times
hurrying
in
all
directions
as
happy
looking
mortals
as
can
be
found
on
the
face
of
the
earth
they
are
different
beings
from
what
they
are
in
the
field
the
temporary
relaxation
the
brief
deliverance
from
fear
and
from
the
lash
producing
an
entire
metamorphosis
in
their
appearance
and
demeanor
in
visiting
riding
renewing
old
friendships
or
perchance
reviving
some
old
attachment
or
pursuing
whatever
pleasure
may
suggest
itself
the
time
is
occupied
such
is
southern
life
as
it
is
days
in
the
as
i
found
it
the
other
three
hundred
and
being
days
of
weariness
and
fear
and
suffering
and
unremitting
labor
marriage
is
frequently
contracted
during
the
holidays
if
such
an
institution
may
be
said
to
exist
among
them
the
only
ceremony
required
before
entering
into
that
holy
estate
is
to
obtain
the
consent
of
the
respective
owners
it
is
usually
encouraged
by
the
masters
of
female
slaves
either
party
can
have
as
many
husbands
or
wives
as
the
owner
will
permit
and
either
is
at
liberty
to
discard
the
other
at
pleasure
the
law
in
relation
to
divorce
or
to
bigamy
and
so
forth
is
not
applicable
to
property

i
was
constantly
employed
on
the
plantation
of
master
epps
he
was
considered
but
a
small
planter
not
having
a
sufficient
number
of
hands
to
require
the
services
of
an
overseer
acting
in
the

capacity
himself
not
able

accompanied
by
several
dogs
they
follow
equipped
in
this
fashion
in

of
the
slaves
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
upon
them
all
the
requisite
qualifications
in
an
overseer
are
utter
heartlessness
brutality
and
cruelty
it
is
his
business
to
produce
large
crops
and
if
that
is
accomplished
no

what
amount
of

it
may

faint
or

he
is
unable

maintain

unable
also

endure

having
been
instances
when
such
weapons
were
necessary
goaded
into
uncontrollable
madness
even
the
slave
will
sometimes
turn
upon
his
oppressor
the
gallows
were
standing
at
marksville
last
january
upon
which
one
was
executed
a
year
ago
for
killing
his
overseer
it
occurred
not
many
miles
from
epps
plantation
on
red
river
the
slave
was
given
his
task
at
splitting
rails
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
overseer
sent
him
on
an
errand
which
occupied
so
much
time
that
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
perform
the
task
the
next
day
he
was
called
to
an
account
but
the
loss
of
time
occasioned
by
the
errand
was
no
excuse
and
he
was
ordered
to
kneel
and
bare
his
back
for
the
reception
of
the
lash
they
were
in
the
woods
alone
beyond
the
reach
of
sight
or
hearing
the
boy
submitted
until
maddened
at
such
injustice
and
insane
with
pain
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
seizing
an
axe
literally
chopped
the
overseer
in
pieces
he
made
no
attempt
whatever
at
concealment
but
hastening
to
his
master
related
the
whole
affair
and
declared
himself
ready
to
expiate
the
wrong
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
he
was
led
to
the
scaffold
and
while
the
rope
was
around
his
neck
maintained
an
undismayed
and
fearless
bearing
and
with
his
last
words
justified
the
act
besides
the
overseer
there
are
drivers
under
him
the
number
being
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
hands
in
the
field
the
drivers
are
black
who
in
addition
to
the
performance
of
their
equal
share
of
work
are
compelled
to
do
the
whipping
of
their
several
gangs
whips
hang
around
their
necks
and
if
they
fail
to
use
them
thoroughly
are
whipped
themselves
they
have
a
few
privileges
however
for
example
in
the
hands
are
not
allowed
to
sit
down
long
enough
to
eat
their
dinners
carts
filled
with
corn
cake
cooked
at
the
kitchen
are
driven
into
the
field
at
noon
the
cake
is
distributed
by
the
drivers
and
must
be
eaten
with
the
least
possible
delay
when
the
slave
ceases
to
perspire
as
he
often
does
when
taxed
beyond
his
strength
he
falls
to
the
ground
and
becomes
entirely
helpless
it
is
then
the
duty
of
the
driver
to
drag
him
into
the
shade
of
the
standing
cotton
or
cane
or
of
a
neighboring
tree
where
he
dashes
buckets
of
water
upon
him
and
uses
other
means
of
bringing
out
perspiration
again
when
he
is
ordered
to
his
place
and
compelled
to
continue
his
labor
at
huff
power
when
i
first
came
to
epps
tom
one
of
negroes
was
driver
he
was
a
burly
fellow
and
severe
in
the
extreme
after
epps
removal
to
bayou
boeuf
that
distinguished
honor
was
conferred
upon
myself
up
to
the
time
of
my
departure
i
had
to
wear
a
whip
about
my
neck
in
the
field
if
epps
was
present
i
dared
not
show
any
lenity
not
having
the
christian
fortitude
of
a
certain
uncle
tom
sufficiently
to
brave
his
wrath
by
refusing
to
perform
the
office
in
that
way
only
i
escaped
the
immediate
martyrdom
he
suffered
and
withal
saved
my
companions
much
suffering
as
it
proved
in
the
end
epps
i
soon
found
whether
actually
in
the
field
or
not
had
his
eyes
pretty
generally
upon
us
from
the
piazza
from
behind
some
adjacent
tree
or
other
concealed
point
of
observation
he
was
perpetually
on
the
watch
if
one
of
us
had
been
backward
or
idle
through
the
day
we
were
apt
to
be
told
all
about
it
on
returning
to
the
quarters
and
as
it
was
a
matter
of
principle
with
him
to
reprove
every
offence
of
that
kind
that
came
within
his
knowledge
the
offender
not
only
was
certain
of
receiving
a
castigation
for
his
tardiness
but
i
likewise
was
punished
for
permitting
it
if
on
the
other
hand
he
had
seen
me
use
the
lash
freely
the
man
was
satisfied
practice
makes
perfect
truly
and
during
my
eight
years
experience
as
a
driver
i
learned
to
handle
the
whip
with
marvelous
dexterity
and
precision
throwing
the
lash
within
a
breadth
of
the
back
the
ear
the
nose
without
however
touching
either
of
them
if
epps
was
observed
at
a
distance
or
we
had
reason
to
apprehend
he
was
sneaking
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
i
would
commence
plying
the
lash
vigorously
when
according
to
arrangement
they
would
squirm
and
screech
as
if
in
agony
although
not
one
of
them
had
in
fact
been
even
grazed
patsey
would
take
occasion
if
he
made
his
appearance
presently
to
mumble
in
his
hearing
some
complaints
that
platt
was
lashing
them
the
whole
time
and
uncle
abram
with
an
appearance
of
honesty
peculiar
to
himself
would
declare
roundly
i
had
just
whipped
them
worse
than
general
jackson
whipped
the
enemy
at
if
epps
was
not
drunk
and
in
one
of
his
beastly
humors
this
was
in
general
satisfactory
if
he
was
some
one
or
more
of
us
must
suffer
as
a
matter
of
course
sometimes
his
violence
assumed
a
dangerous
form
placing
the
lives
of
his
human
stock
in
jeopardy
on
one
occasion
the
drunken
madman
thought
to
amuse
himself
by
cutting
my
throat
he
had
been
absent
at
holmesville
in
attendance
at
a
and
none
of
us
were
aware
of
his
return
while
hoeing
by
the
side
of
patsey
she
exclaimed
in
a
low
voice
suddenly
platt
d
see
old
beckoning
me
to
come
to
him
glancing
sideways
i
discovered
him
in
the
edge
of
the
field
motioning
and
grimacing
as
was
his
habit
when
aware
of
his
lewd
intentions
patsey
began
to
cry
i
whispered
her
not
to
look
up
and
to
continue
at
her
work
as
if
she
had
not
observed
him
suspecting
the
truth
of
the
matter
however
he
soon
staggered
up
to
me
in
a
great
rage
what
did
you
say
to
pats
he
demanded
with
an
oath
i
made
him
some
evasive
answer
which
only
had
the
effect
of
increasing
his
violence
how
long
have
you
owned
this
plantation
you
d
d
nigger
he
inquired
with
a
malicious
sneer
at
the
same
time
taking
hold
of
my
shirt
collar
with
one
hand
and
thrusting
the
other
into
his
pocket
now
i
cut
your
black
throat
that
what
i
do
drawing
his
knife
from
his
pocket
as
he
said
it
but
with
one
hand
he
was
unable
to
open
it
until
finally
seizing
the
blade
in
his
teeth
i
saw
he
was
about
to
succeed
and
felt
the
necessity
of
escaping
from
him
for
in
his
present
reckless
state
it
was
evident
he
was
not
joking
by
any
means
my
shirt
was
open
in
front
and
as
i
turned
round
quickly
and
sprang
from
him
while
he
still
retained
his
gripe
it
was
stripped
entirely
from
my
back
there
was
no
difficulty
now
in
eluding
him
he
would
chase
me
until
out
of
breath
then
stop
until
it
was
recovered
swear
and
renew
the
chase
again
now
he
would
command
me
to
come
to
him
now
endeavor
to
coax
me
but
i
was
careful
to
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
in
this
manner
we
made
the
circuit
of
the
field
several
times
he
making
desperate
plunges
and
i
always
dodging
them
more
amused
than
frightened
well
knowing
that
when
his
sober
senses
returned
he
would
laugh
at
his
own
drunken
folly
at
length
i
observed
the
mistress
standing
by
the
yard
fence
watching
our
manoeuvres
shooting
past
him
i
ran
directly
to
her
epps
on
discovering
her
did
not
follow
he
remained
about
the
field
an
hour
or
more
during
which
time
i
stood
by
the
mistress
having
related
the
particulars
of
what
had
taken
place
now
was
aroused
again
denouncing
her
husband
and
patsey
about
equally
finally
epps
came
towards
the
house
by
this
time
nearly
sober
walking
demurely
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
attempting
to
look
as
innocent
as
a
child
as
he
approached
nevertheless
mistress
epps
began
to
berate
him
roundly
heaping
upon
him
many
rather
disrespectful
epithets
and
demanding
for
what
reason
he
had
attempted
to
cut
my
throat
epps
made
wondrous
strange
of
it
all
and
to
my
surprise
swore
by
all
the
saints
in
the
calendar
he
had
not
spoken
to
me
that
day
platt
you
lying
nigger
i
was
his
brazen
appeal
to
me
it
is
not
safe
to
contradict
a
master
even
by
the
assertion
of
a
truth
so
i
was
silent
and
when
he
entered
the
house
i
returned
to
the
field
and
the
affair
was
never
after
alluded
to
shortly
after
this
time
a
circumstance
occurred
that
came
nigh
divulging
the
secret
of
my
real
name
and
history
which
i
had
so
long
and
carefully
concealed
and
upon
which
i
was
convinced
depended
my
final
escape
soon
after
he
purchased
me
epps
asked
me
if
i
could
write
and
read
and
on
being
informed
that
i
had
received
some
instruction
in
those
branches
of
education
he
assured
me
with
emphasis
if
he
ever
caught
me
with
a
book
or
with
pen
and
ink
he
would
give
me
a
hundred
lashes
he
said
he
wanted
me
to
understand
that
he
bought
niggers
to
work
and
not
to
educate
he
never
inquired
a
word
of
my
past
life
or
from
whence
i
came
the
mistress
however
me
frequently
about
washington
which
she
supposed
was
my
native
city
and
more
than
once
remarked
that
i
did
not
talk
nor
act
like
the
other
niggers
and
she
was
sure
i
had
seen
more
of
the
world
than
i
admitted
my
great
object
always
was
to
invent
means
of
getting
a
letter
secretly
into
the
directed
to
some
of
my
friends
or
family
at
the
north
the
difficulty
of
such
an
achievement
can
not
be
comprehended
by
one
unacquainted
with
the
severe
restrictions
imposed
upon
me
in
the
first
place
i
was
deprived
of
pen
ink
and
paper
in
the
second
place
a
slave
can
not
leave
his
plantation
without
a
pass
nor
will
a
mail
a
letter
for
one
without
written
instructions
from
his
owner
i
was
in
slavery
nine
years
and
always
watchful
and
on
the
alert
before
i
met
with
the
good
fortune
of
obtaining
a
sheet
of
paper
while
epps
was
in
one
winter
disposing
of
his
cotton
the
mistress
sent
me
to
holmesville
with
an
order
for
several
articles
and
among
the
rest
a
quantity
of
foolscap
i
appropriated
a
sheet
concealing
it
in
the
cabin
under
the
board
on
which
i
slept
after
various
experiments
i
succeeded
in
making
ink
by
boiling
white
maple
bark
and
with
a
feather
plucked
from
the
wing
of
a
duck
manufactured
a
pen
when
all
were
asleep
in
the
cabin
by
the
light
of
the
coals
lying
upon
my
plank
couch
i
managed
to
complete
a
somewhat
lengthy
epistle
it
was
directed
to
an
old
acquaintance
at
sandy
hill
stating
my
condition
and
urging
him
to
take
measures
to
restore
me
to
liberty
this
letter
i
kept
a
long
time
contriving
measures
by
which
it
could
be
safely
deposited
in
the
at
length
a
low
fellow
by
the
name
of
armsby
hitherto
a
stranger
came
into
the
neighborhood
seeking
a
situation
as
overseer
he
applied
to
epps
and
was
about
the
plantation
for
several
days
he
next
went
over
to
shaw
near
by
and
remained
with
him
several
weeks
shaw
was
generally
surrounded
by
such
worthless
characters
being
himself
noted
as
a
gambler
and
unprincipled
man
he
had
made
a
wife
of
his
slave
charlotte
and
a
brood
of
young
mulattoes
were
growing
up
in
his
house
armsby
became
so
much
reduced
at
last
that
he
was
compelled
to
labor
with
the
slaves
a
white
man
working
in
the
field
is
a
rare
and
unusual
spectacle
on
bayou
boeuf
i
improved
every
opportunity
of
cultivating
his
acquaintance
privately
desiring
to
obtain
his
confidence
so
far
as
to
be
willing
to
intrust
the
letter
to
his
keeping
he
visited
marksville
repeatedly
he
informed
me
a
town
some
twenty
miles
distant
and
there
i
proposed
to
myself
the
letter
should
be
mailed
carefully
deliberating
on
the
most
proper
manner
of
approaching
him
on
the
subject
i
concluded
finally
to
ask
him
simply
if
he
would
deposit
a
letter
for
me
in
the
marksville
the
next
time
he
visited
that
place
without
disclosing
to
him
that
the
letter
was
written
or
any
of
the
particulars
it
contained
for
i
had
fears
that
he
might
betray
me
and
knew
that
some
inducement
must
be
held
out
to
him
of
a
pecuniary
nature
before
it
would
be
safe
to
confide
in
him
as
late
as
one
one
night
i
stole
noiselessly
from
my
cabin
and
crossing
the
field
to
shaw
found
him
sleeping
on
the
piazza
i
had
but
a
few
picayunes
the
proceeds
of
my
fiddling
performances
but
all
i
had
in
the
world
i
promised
him
if
he
would
do
me
the
favor
required
i
begged
him
not
to
expose
me
if
he
could
not
grant
the
request
he
assured
me
upon
his
honor
he
would
deposit
it
in
the
marksville
and
that
he
would
keep
it
an
inviolable
secret
forever
though
the
letter
was
in
my
pocket
at
the
time
i
dared
not
then
deliver
it
to
him
but
stating
i
would
have
it
written
in
a
day
or
two
bade
him
good
night
and
returned
to
my
cabin
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
expel
the
suspicions
i
entertained
and
all
night
i
lay
awake
revolving
in
my
mind
the
safest
course
to
pursue
i
was
willing
to
risk
a
great
deal
to
accomplish
my
purpose
but
should
the
letter
by
any
means
fall
into
the
hands
of
epps
it
would
be
a
to
my
aspirations
i
was
perplexed
in
the
extreme
my
suspicions
were
as
the
sequel
demonstrated
the
next
day
but
one
while
scraping
cotton
in
the
field
epps
seated
himself
on
the
line
fence
between
shaw
plantation
and
his
own
in
such
a
position
as
to
overlook
the
scene
of
our
labors
presently
armsby
made
his
appearance
and
mounting
the
fence
took
a
seat
beside
him
they
remained
two
or
three
hours
all
of
which
time
i
was
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
that
night
while
broiling
my
bacon
epps
entered
the
cabin
with
his
rawhide
in
his
hand
well
boy
said
he
i
understand
i
got
a
larned
nigger
that
writes
letters
and
tries
to
get
white
fellows
to
mail
wonder
if
you
know
who
he
is
my
worst
fears
were
realized
and
although
it
may
not
be
considered
entirely
creditable
even
under
the
circumstances
yet
a
resort
to
duplicity
and
downright
falsehood
was
the
only
refuge
that
presented
itself
do
know
nothing
about
it
master
epps
i
answered
him
assuming
an
air
of
ignorance
and
surprise
do
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
sir
wa
you
over
to
shaw
night
before
last
he
inquired
no
master
was
the
reply
you
asked
that
fellow
armsby
to
mail
a
letter
for
you
at
marksville
why
lord
master
i
never
spoke
three
words
to
him
in
all
my
life
i
do
know
what
you
mean
well
he
continued
armsby
told
me
the
devil
was
among
my
niggers
that
i
had
one
that
needed
close
watching
or
he
would
run
away
and
when
i
axed
him
why
he
said
you
come
over
to
shaw
and
waked
him
up
in
the
night
and
wanted
him
to
carry
a
letter
to
marksville
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
that
ha
all
i
got
to
say
master
i
replied
is
there
is
no
truth
in
it
how
could
i
write
a
letter
without
any
ink
or
paper
there
is
nobody
i
want
to
write
to
i
haint
got
no
friends
living
as
i
know
of
that
armsby
is
a
lying
drunken
fellow
they
say
and
nobody
believes
him
anyway
you
know
i
always
tell
the
truth
and
that
i
never
go
off
the
plantation
without
a
pass
now
master
i
can
see
what
that
armsby
is
after
plain
enough
he
want
you
to
hire
him
for
an
overseer
yes
he
wanted
me
to
hire
him
answered
epps
that
it
said
i
he
wants
to
make
you
believe
we
all
going
to
run
away
and
then
he
thinks
you
hire
an
overseer
to
watch
us
he
just
made
that
story
out
of
whole
cloth
he
wants
to
get
a
situation
it
all
a
lie
master
you
may
depend
o
epps
mused
awhile
evidently
impressed
with
the
plausibility
of
my
theory
and
exclaimed
i
d
d
platt
if
i
do
believe
you
tell
the
truth
he
must
take
me
for
a
soft
to
think
he
can
come
it
over
me
with
them
kind
of
yarns
mus
he
maybe
he
thinks
he
can
fool
me
maybe
he
thinks
i
do
know
nothing
ca
take
care
of
my
own
niggers
eh
soft
soap
old
epps
eh
ha

ha
d

set
the
dogs
on
him

and
with
many
other
comments
descriptive
of
armsby
general
character
and
his
capability
of
taking
care
of
his
own
business
and
attending
to
his
own
niggers
master
epps
left
the
cabin
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
threw
the
letter
in
the
fire
and
with
a
desponding
and
despairing
heart
beheld
the
epistle
which
had
cost
me
so
much
anxiety
and
thought
and
which
i
fondly
hoped
would
have
been
my
forerunner
to
the
land
of
freedom
writhe
and
shrivel
on
its
bed
of
coals
and
dissolve
into
smoke
and
ashes
armsby
the
treacherous
wretch
was
driven
from
shaw
plantation
not
long
subsequently
much
to
my
relief
for
i
feared
he
might
renew
his
conversation
and
perhaps
induce
epps
to
credit
him
i
knew
not
now
whither
to
look
for
deliverance
hopes
sprang
up
in
my
heart
only
to
be
crushed
and
blighted
the
summer
of
my
life
was
passing
away
i
felt
i
was
growing
prematurely
old
that
a
few
years
more
and
toil
and
grief
and
the
poisonous
miasmas
of
the
swamps
would
accomplish
their
work
upon
me
would
consign
me
to
the
embrace
to
moulder
and
be
forgotten
repelled
betrayed
cut
off
from
the
hope
of
succor
i
could
only
prostrate
myself
upon
the
earth
and
groan
in
unutterable
anguish
the
hope
of
rescue
was
the
only
light
that
cast
a
ray
of
comfort
on
my
heart
that
was
now
flickering
faint
and
low
another
breath
of
disappointment
would
extinguish
it
altogether
leaving
me
to
grope
in
midnight
darkness
to
the
end

life

down

i

arrived
omitting
many
occurrences
uninteresting
to
the
reader
was
an
unlucky
year
for
my
companion
wiley
the
husband
of
phebe
whose
taciturn
and
retiring
nature
has
thus
far
kept
him
in
the
background
notwithstanding
wiley
seldom
opened
his
mouth
and
revolved
in
his
obscure
and
unpretending
orbit
without
a
grumble
nevertheless
the
warm
elements
of
sociality
were
strong
in
the
bosom
of
that
silent
nigger
in
the
exuberance
of
his
disregarding
the
philosophy
of
uncle
abram
and
setting
the
counsels
of
aunt
phebe
utterly
at
naught
he
had
the
to
essay
a
nocturnal
visit
to
a
neighboring
cabin
without
a
pass
so
attractive
was
the
society
in
which
he
found
himself
that
wiley
took
little
note
of
the
passing
hours
and
the
light
began
to
break
in
the
east
before
he
was
aware
speeding
homeward
as
fast
as
he
could
run
he
hoped
to
reach
the
quarters
before
the
horn
would
sound
but
unhappily
he
was
spied
on
the
way
by
a
company
of
patrollers
how
it
is
in
other
dark
places
of
slavery
i
do
not
know
but
on
bayou
boeuf
there
is
an
organization
of
patrollers
as
they
are
styled
whose
business
it
is
to
seize
and
whip
any
slave
they
may
find
wandering
from
the
plantation
they
ride
on
horseback
headed
by
a
captain
armed
and
accompanied
by
dogs
they
have
the
right
either
by
law
or
by
general
consent
to
inflict
discretionary
chastisement
upon
a
black
man
caught
beyond
the
boundaries
of
his
master
estate
without
a
pass
and
even
to
shoot
him
if
he
attempts
to
escape
each
company
has
a
certain
distance
to
ride
up
and
down
the
bayou
they
are
compensated
by
the
planters
who
contribute
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
slaves
they
own
the
clatter
of
their
horses
hoofs
dashing
by
can
be
heard
at
all
hours
of
the
night
and
frequently
they
may
be
seen
driving
a
slave
before
them
or
leading
him
by
a
rope
fastened
around
his
neck
to
his
owner
plantation
wiley
fled
before
one
of
these
companies
thinking
he
could
reach
his
cabin
before
they
could
overtake
him
but
one
of
their
dogs
a
great
ravenous
hound
griped
him
by
the
leg
and
held
him
fast
the
patrollers
whipped
him
severely
and
brought
him
a
prisoner
to
epps
from
him
he
received
another
flagellation
still
more
severe
so
that
the
cuts
of
the
lash
and
the
bites
of
the
dog
rendered
him
sore
stiff
and
miserable
insomuch
he
was
scarcely
able
to
move
it
was
impossible
in
such
a
state
to
keep
up
his
row
and
consequently
there
was
not
an
hour
in
the
day
but
wiley
felt
the
sting
of
his
master
rawhide
on
his
raw
and
bleeding
back
his
sufferings
became
intolerable
and
finally
he
resolved
to
run
away
without
disclosing
his
intentions
to
run
away
even
to
his
wife
phebe
he
proceeded
to
make
arrangements
for
carrying
his
plan
into
execution
having
cooked
his
whole
week
allowance
he
cautiously
left
the
cabin
on
a
sunday
night
after
the
inmates
of
the
quarters
were
asleep
when
the
horn
sounded
in
the
morning
wiley
did
not
make
his
appearance
search
was
made
for
him
in
the
cabins
in
the
in
the
and
in
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
premises
each
of
us
was
examined
touching
any
knowledge
we
might
have
that
could
throw
light
upon
his
sudden
disappearance
or
present
whereabouts
epps
raved
and
stormed
and
mounting
his
horse
galloped
to
neighboring
plantations
making
inquiries
in
all
directions
the
search
was
fruitless
nothing
whatever
was
elicited
going
to
show
what
had
become
of
the
missing
man
the
dogs
were
led
to
the
swamp
but
were
unable
to
strike
his
trail
they
would
circle
away
through
the
forest
their
noses
to
the
ground
but
invariably
returned
in
a
short
time
to
the
spot
from
whence
they
started
wiley
had
escaped
and
so
secretly
and
cautiously
as
to
elude
and
baffle
all
pursuit
days
and
even
weeks
passed
away
and
nothing
could
be
heard
of
him
epps
did
nothing
but
curse
and
swear
it
was
the
only
topic
of
conversation
among
us
when
alone
we
indulged
in
a
great
deal
of
speculation
in
regard
to
him
one
suggesting
he
might
have
been
drowned
in
some
bayou
inasmuch
as
he
was
a
poor
swimmer
another
that
perhaps
he
might
have
been
devoured
by
alligators
or
stung
by
the
venomous
moccasin
whose
bite
is
certain
and
sudden
death
the
warm
and
hearty
sympathies
of
us
all
however
were
with
poor
wiley
wherever
he
might
be
many
an
earnest
prayer
ascended
from
the
lips
of
uncle
abram
beseeching
safety
for
the
wanderer
in
about
three
weeks
when
all
hope
of
ever
seeing
him
again
was
dismissed
to
our
surprise
he
one
day
appeared
among
us
on
leaving
the
plantation
he
informed
us
it
was
his
intention
to
make
his
way
back
to
south
carolina
to
the
old
quarters
of
master
buford
during
the
day
he
remained
secreted
sometimes
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
and
at
night
pressed
forward
through
the
swamps
finally
one
morning
just
at
dawn
he
reached
the
shore
of
red
river
while
standing
on
the
bank
considering
how
he
could
cross
it
a
white
man
accosted
him
and
demanded
a
pass
without
one
and
evidently
a
runaway
he
was
taken
to
alexandria
the
shire
town
of
the
parish
of
rapides
and
confined
in
prison
it
happened
several
days
after
that
joseph
roberts
uncle
of
mistress
epps
was
in
alexandria
and
going
into
the
jail
recognized
him
wiley
had
worked
on
his
plantation
when
epps
resided
at
huff
power
paying
the
jail
fee
and
writing
him
a
pass
underneath
which
was
a
note
to
epps
requesting
him
not
to
whip
him
on
his
return
wiley
was
sent
back
to
bayou
boeuf
it
was
the
hope
that
hung
upon
this
request
and
which
roberts
assured
him
would
be
respected
by
his
master
that
sustained
him
as
he
approached
the
house
the
request
however
as
may
be
readily
supposed
was
entirely
disregarded
after
being
kept
in
suspense
three
days
wiley
was
stripped
and
compelled
to
endure
one
of
those
inhuman
floggings
to
which
the
poor
slave
is
so
often
subjected
it
was
the
first
and
last
attempt
of
wiley
to
run
away
the
long
scars
upon
his
back
which
he
will
carry
with
him
to
the
grave
perpetually
remind
him
of
the
dangers
of
such
a
step
there
was
not
a
day
throughout
the
ten
years
i
belonged
to
epps
that
i
did
not
consult
with
myself
upon
the
prospect
of
escape
i
laid
many
plans
which
at
the
time
i
considered
excellent
ones
but
one
after
the
other
they
were
all
abandoned
no
man
who
has
never
been
placed
in
such
a
situation
can
comprehend
the
thousand
obstacles
thrown
in
the
way
of
the
flying
slave
every
white
man
hand
is
raised
against
him
the
patrollers
are
watching
for
him
the
hounds
are
ready
to
follow
on
his
track
and
the
nature
of
the
country
is
such
as
renders
it
impossible
to
pass
through
it
with
any
safety
i
thought
however
that
the
time
might
come
perhaps
when
i
should
be
running
through
the
swamps
again
i
concluded
in
that
case
to
be
prepared
for
dogs
should
they
pursue
me
he
possessed
several
one
of
which
was
a
notorious
and
the
most
fierce
and
savage
of
his
breed
while
out
hunting
the
coon
or
the
opossum
i
never
allowed
an
opportunity
to
escape
when
alone
of
whipping
them
severely
in
this
manner
i
succeeded
at
length
in
subduing
them
completely
they
feared
me
obeying
my
voice
at
once
when
others
had
no
control
over
them
whatever
had
they
followed
and
overtaken
me
i
doubt
not
they
would
have
shrank
from
attacking
me
notwithstanding
the
certainty
of
being
captured
the
woods
and
swamps
are
nevertheless
continually
filled
with
runaways
many
of
them
when
sick
or
so
worn
out
as
to
be
unable
to
perform
their
tasks
escape
into
the
swamps
willing
to
suffer
the
punishment
inflicted
for
such
offences
in
order
to
obtain
a
day
or
two
of
rest
while
i
belonged
to
ford
i
was
unwittingly
the
means
of
disclosing
the
of
six
or
eight
who
had
taken
up
their
residence
in
the
great
pine
woods
adam
taydem
frequently
sent
me
from
the
mills
over
to
the
opening
after
provisions
the
whole
distance
was
then
a
thick
pine
forest
about
ten
of
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
while
walking
along
the
texas
road
returning
to
the
mills
carrying
a
dressed
pig
in
a
bag
swung
over
my
shoulder
i
heard
footsteps
behind
me
and
turning
round
beheld
two
black
men
in
the
dress
of
slaves
approaching
at
a
rapid
pace
when
within
a
short
distance
one
of
them
raised
a
club
as
if
intending
to
strike
me
the
other
snatched
at
the
bag
i
managed
to
dodge
them
both
and
seizing
a
pine
knot
hurled
it
with
such
force
against
the
head
of
one
of
them
that
he
was
prostrated
apparently
senseless
to
the
ground
just
then
two
more
made
their
appearance
from
one
side
of
the
road
before
they
could
grapple
me
however
i
succeeded
in
passing
them
and
taking
to
my
heels
fled
much
affrighted
towards
the
mills
when
adam
was
informed
of
the
adventure
he
hastened
straightway
to
the
indian
village
and
arousing
cascalla
and
several
of
his
tribe
started
in
pursuit
of
the
highwaymen
i
accompanied
them
to
the
scene
of
attack
when
we
discovered
a
puddle
of
blood
in
the
road
where
the
man
whom
i
had
smitten
with
the
pine
knot
had
fallen
after
searching
carefully
through
the
woods
a
long
time
one
of
cascalla
men
discovered
a
smoke
curling
up
through
the
branches
of
several
prostrate
pines
whose
tops
had
fallen
together
the
rendezvous
was
cautiously
surrounded
and
all
of
them
taken
prisoners
they
had
escaped
from
a
plantation
in
the
vicinity
of
lamourie
and
had
been
secreted
there
three
weeks
they
had
no
evil
design
upon
me
except
to
frighten
me
out
of
my
pig
having
observed
me
passing
towards
ford
just
at
and
suspecting
the
nature
of
my
errand
they
had
followed
me
seen
me
butcher
and
dress
the
porker
and
start
on
my
return
they
had
been
pinched
for
food
and
were
driven
to
this
extremity
by
necessity
adam
conveyed
them
to
the
parish
jail
and
was
liberally
rewarded
not
unfrequently
the
runaway
loses
his
life
in
the
attempt
to
escape
epps
premises
were
bounded
on
one
side
by
carey
a
very
extensive
sugar
plantation
he
cultivates
annually
at
least
fifteen
hundred
acres
of

of

besides
this
he
also
cultivates
five
or
six
hundred
acres
of
corn
and
cotton
he
owned
last
year
one
hundred
and
fifty
three

hands
besides
nearly
as
many
children
and
yearly
hires
a
drove
during
the
busy
season
from
this
side
the
mississippi
one
of
his
negro
drivers
a
pleasant
intelligent
boy
was
named
augustus
during
the
holidays
and
occasionally
while
at
work
in
adjoining
fields
i
had
an
opportunity
of
making
his
acquaintance
which
eventually
ripened
into
a
warm
and
mutual
attachment
summer
before
last
he
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
the
overseer
a
coarse
heartless
brute
who
whipped
him
most
cruelly
augustus
ran
away
reaching
a
cane
rick
on
hawkins
plantation
he
secreted
himself
in
the
top
of
it
all
carey
dogs
were
put
upon
his
track
some
fifteen
of
them
and
soon
scented
his
footsteps
to
the
hiding
place
they
surrounded
the
rick
baying
and
scratching
but
could
not
reach
him
presently
guided
by
the
clamor
of
the
hounds
the
pursuers
rode
up
when
the
overseer
mounting
on
to
the
rick
drew
him
forth
as
he
rolled
down
to
the
ground
the
whole
pack
plunged
upon
him
and
before
they
could
be
beaten
off
had
gnawed
and
mutilated
his
body
in
the
most
shocking
manner
their
teeth
having
penetrated
to
the
bone
in
an
hundred
places
he
was
taken
up
tied
upon
a
mule
and
carried
home
but
this
was
augustus
last
trouble
he
lingered
until
the
next
day
when
death
sought
the
unhappy
boy
and
kindly
relieved
him
from
his
agony
it
was
not
unusual
for
slave
women
as
well
as
slave
men
to
endeavor
to
escape
nelly
eldret
girl
with
whom
i
lumbered
for
a
time
in
the
big
cane
brake
lay
concealed
in
epps
corn
crib
three
days
at
night
when
his
family
were
asleep
she
would
steal
into
the
quarters
for
food
and
return
to
the
crib
again
we
concluded
it
would
no
longer
be
safe
for
us
to
allow
her
to
remain
and
accordingly
she
retraced
her
steps
to
her
own
cabin
but
the
most
remarkable
instance
of
a
successful
evasion
of
dogs
and
hunters
was
the
following
among
carey
girls
was
one
by
the
name
of
celeste
she
was
nineteen
or
twenty
and
far
whiter
than
her
owner
or
any
of
his
offspring
it
required
a
close
inspection
to
distinguish
in
her
features
the
slightest
trace
of
african
blood
a
stranger
would
never
have
dreamed
that
she
was
the
descendant
of
slaves
i
was
sitting
in
my
cabin
late
at
night
playing
a
low
air
on
my
violin
when
the
door
opened
carefully
and
celeste
stood
before
me
she
was
pale
and
haggard
had
an
apparition
arisen
from
the
earth
i
could
not
have
been
more
startled
who
are
you
i
demanded
after
gazing
at
her
a
moment
i
hungry
give
me
some
bacon
was
her
reply
my
first
impression
was
that
she
was
some
deranged
young
mistress
who
escaping
from
home
was
wandering
she
knew
not
whither
and
had
been
attracted
to
my
cabin
by
the
sound
of
the
violin
the
coarse
cotton
slave
dress
she
wore
however
soon
dispelled
such
a
supposition
what
is
your
name
i
again
interrogated
my
name
is
celeste
she
answered
i
belong
to
carey
and
have
been
two
days
among
the
palmettoes
i
am
sick
and
ca
work
and
would
rather
die
in
the
swamp
than
be
whipped
to
death
by
the
overseer
carey
dogs
wo
follow
me
they
have
tried
to
set
them
on
a
secret
between
them
and
celeste
and
they
wont
mind
the
devilish
orders
of
the
overseer
give
me
some
meat
i
starving
i
divided
my
scanty
allowance
with
her
and
while
partaking
of
it
she
related
how
she
had
managed
to
escape
and
described
the
place
of
her
concealment
in
the
edge
of
the
swamp
not
half
a
mile
from
epps
house
was
a
large
space
thousands
of
acres
in
extent
thickly
covered
with
palmetto
tall
trees
whose
long
arms
interlocked
each
other
formed
a
canopy
above
them
so
dense
as
to
exclude
the
beams
of
the
sun
it
was
like
twilight
always
even
in
the
middle
of
the
brightest
day
in
the
centre
of
this
great
space
which
nothing
but
serpents
very
often
explore
a
sombre
and
solitary
spot
celeste
had
erected
a
rude
hut
of
dead
branches
that
had
fallen
to
the
ground
and
covered
it
with
the
leaves
of
the
palmetto
this
was
the
abode
she
had
selected
she
had
no
fear
of
carey
dogs
any
more
than
i
had
of
epps
it
is
a
fact
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
explain
that
there
are
those
whose
tracks
the
hounds
will
absolutely
refuse
to
follow
celeste
was
one
of
them
for
several
nights
she
came
to
my
cabin
for
food
on
one
occasion
our
dogs
barked
as
she
approached
which
aroused
epps
and
induced
him
to
reconnoitre
the
premises
he
did
not
discover
her
but
after
that
it
was
not
deemed
prudent
for
her
to
come
to
the
yard
when
all
was
silent
i
carried
provisions
to
a
certain
spot
agreed
upon
where
she
would
find
them
in
this
manner
celeste
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
summer
she
regained
her
health
and
became
strong
and
hearty
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
the
howlings
of
wild
animals
can
be
heard
at
night
along
the
borders
of
the
swamps
several
times
they
had
made
her
a
midnight
call
awakening
her
from
slumber
with
a
growl
terrified
by
such
unpleasant
salutations
she
finally
concluded
to
abandon
her
lonely
dwelling
and
accordingly
returning
to
her
master
was
scourged
her
neck
meanwhile
being
fastened
in
the
stocks
and
sent
into
the
field
again
the
year
before
my
arrival
in
the
country
there
was
a
concerted
movement
among
a
number
of
slaves
on
bayou
boeuf
that
terminated
tragically
indeed
it
was
i
presume
a
matter
of
newspaper
notoriety
at
the
time
but
all
the
knowledge
i
have
of
it
has
been
derived
from
the
relation
of
those
living
at
that
period
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
excitement
it
has
become
a
subject
of
general
and
unfailing
interest
in
every
on
the
bayou
and
will
doubtless
go
down
to
succeeding
generations
as
their
chief
tradition
lew
cheney
with
whom
i
became
acquainted
a
shrewd
cunning
negro
more
intelligent
than
the
generality
of
his
race
but
unscrupulous
and
full
of
treachery
conceived
the
project
of
organizing
a
company
sufficiently
strong
to
fight
their
way
against
all
opposition
to
the
neighboring
territory
of
mexico
a
remote
spot
far
within
the
depths
of
the
swamp
back
of
plantation
was
selected
as
the
rallying
point
lew
flitted
from
one
plantation
to
another
in
the
dead
of
night
preaching
a
crusade
to
mexico
and
like
peter
the
hermit
creating
a
furor
of
excitement
wherever
he
appeared
at
length
a
large
number
of
runaways
were
assembled
stolen
mules
and
corn
gathered
from
the
fields
and
bacon
filched
from
had
been
conveyed
into
the
woods
the
expedition
was
about
ready
to
proceed
when
their
hiding
place
was
discovered
lew
cheney
becoming
convinced
of
the
ultimate
failure
of
his
project
in
order
to
curry
favor
with
his
master
and
avoid
the
consequences
which
he
foresaw
would
follow
deliberately
determined
to
sacrifice
all
his
companions
departing
secretly
from
the
encampment
he
proclaimed
among
the
planters
the
number
collected
in
the
swamp
and
instead
of
stating
truly
the
object
they
had
in
view
asserted
their
intention
was
to
emerge
from
their
seclusion
the
first
favorable
opportunity
and
murder
every
white
person
along
the
bayou
such
an
announcement
exaggerated
as
it
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
filled
the
whole
country
with
terror
the
fugitives
were
surrounded
and
taken
prisoners
carried
in
chains
to
alexandria
and
hung
by
the
populace
not
only
those
but
many
who
were
suspected
though
entirely
innocent
were
taken
from
the
field
and
from
the
cabin
and
without
the
shadow
of
process
or
form
of
trial
hurried
to
the
scaffold
the
planters
on
bayou
boeuf
finally
rebelled
against
such
reckless
destruction
of
property
but
it
was
not
until
a
regiment
of
soldiers
had
arrived
from
some
fort
on
the
texan
frontier
demolished
the
gallows
and
opened
the
doors
of
the
alexandria
prison
that
the
indiscriminate
slaughter
was
stayed
lew
cheney
escaped
and
was
even
rewarded
for
his
treachery
he
is
still
living
but
his
name
is
despised
and
execrated
by
all
his
race
throughout
the
parishes
of
rapides
and
avoyelles
such
an
idea
as
insurrection
however
is
not
new
among
the
enslaved
population
of
bayou
boeuf
more
than
once
i
have
joined
in
serious
consultation
when
the
subject
has
been
discussed
and
there
have
been
times
when
a
word
from
me
would
have
placed
hundreds
of
my
in
an
attitude
of
defiance
without
arms
or
ammunition
or
even
with
them
i
saw
such
a
step
would
result
in
certain
defeat
disaster
and
death
and
always
raised
my
voice
against
it
during
the
mexican
war
i
well
remember
the
extravagant
hopes
that
were
excited
the
news
of
victory
filled
the
great
house
with
rejoicing
but
produced
only
sorrow
and
disappointment
in
the
cabin
in
my
opinion
and
i
have
had
opportunity
to
know
something
of
the
feeling
of
which
i
speak
there
are
not
fifty
slaves
on
the
shores
of
bayou
boeuf
but
would
hail
with
unmeasured
delight
the
approach
of
an
invading
army
they
are
deceived
who
flatter
themselves
that
the
ignorant
and
debased
slave
has
no
conception
of
the
magnitude
of
his
wrongs
they
are
deceived
who
imagine
that
he
arises
from
his
knees
with
back
lacerated
and
bleeding
cherishing
only
a
spirit
of
meekness
and
forgiveness
a
day
may
come
it
come
if
his
prayer
is
heard
a
terrible
day
of
vengeance
when
the
master
in
his
turn
will
cry
in
vain
for
mercy

in

scouted
by

was
constitutionally
subject
to
periods

and
at
such
times
however
little

there
might
be
a
certain
amount
of
punishment
was
inflicted
the
circumstances
attending
the

flogging
but
one
that
i
received
will
show
how
trivial
a
cause
was
sufficient
with
him
for
resorting
to
the
whip
a
residing
in
the
vicinity
of
the
big
pine
woods
called
upon
epps
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
me
he
was
a
tanner
and
currier
by
occupation
transacting
an
extensive
business
and
intended
to
place
me
at
service
in
some
department
of
his
establishment
provided
he
bought
me
aunt
phebe
while
preparing
the
in
the
great
house
overheard
their
conversation
on
returning
to
the
yard
at
night
the
old
woman
ran
to
meet
me
designing
of
course
to
overwhelm
me
with
the
news
she
entered
into
a
minute
repetition
of
all
she
had
heard
and
aunt
phebe
was
one
whose
ears
never
failed
to
drink
in
every
word
of
conversation
uttered
in
her
hearing
she
enlarged
upon
the
fact
that
massa
epps
was
to
sell
me
to
a
tanner
ober
in
de
pine
woods
so
long
and
loudly
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
mistress
who
standing
unobserved
on
the
piazza
at
the
time
was
listening
to
our
conversation
well
aunt
phebe
said
i
i
glad
of
it
i
tired
of
scraping
cotton
and
would
rather
be
a
tanner
i
hope
he
buy
me
did
not
effect
a
purchase
however
the
parties
differing
as
to
price
and
the
morning
following
his
arrival
departed
homewards
he
had
been
gone
but
a
short
time
when
epps
made
his
appearance
in
the
field
now
nothing
will
more
violently
enrage
a
master
especially
epps
than
the
intimation
of
one
of
his
servants
that
he
would
like
to
leave
him
mistress
epps
had
repeated
to
him
my
expressions
to
aunt
phebe
the
evening
previous
as
i
learned
from
the
latter
afterwards
the
mistress
having
mentioned
to
her
that
she
had
overheard
us
on
entering
the
field
epps
walked
directly
to
me
so
platt
you
tired
of
scraping
cotton
are
you
you
would
like
to
change
your
master
eh
you
fond
of
moving
round
traveler
ai
ye
ah
yes
like
to
travel
for
your
health
may
be
feel
above
i
so
you
going
into
the
tanning
business
good
business
devilish
fine
business
enterprising
nigger
i
go
into
that
business
myself
down
on
your
knees
and
strip
that
rag
off
your
back
i
try
my
hand
at
tanning
i
begged
earnestly
and
endeavored
to
soften
him
with
excuses
but
in
vain
there
was
no
other
alternative
so
kneeling
down
i
presented
my
bare
back
for
the
application
of
the
lash
how
do
you
like
he
exclaimed
as
the
rawhide
descended
upon
my
flesh
how
do
you
like
he
repeated
at
every
blow
in
this
manner
he
gave
me
twenty
or
thirty
lashes
incessantly
giving
utterance
to
the
word
tanning
in
one
form
of
expression
or
another
when
sufficiently
tanned
he
allowed
me
to
arise
and
with
a
laugh
assured
me
if
i
still
fancied
the
business
he
would
give
me
further
instruction
in
it
whenever
i
desired
this
time
he
remarked
he
had
only
given
me
a
short
lesson
in
the
next
time
he
would
curry
me
down
uncle
abram
also
was
frequently
treated
with
great
brutality
although
he
was
one
of
the
kindest
and
most
faithful
creatures
in
the
world
he
was
my
for
years
there
was
a
benevolent
expression
in
the
old
man
face
pleasant
to
behold
he
regarded
us
with
a
kind
of
parental
feeling
always
counseling
us
with
remarkable
gravity
and
deliberation
returning
from
marshall
plantation
one
afternoon
whither
i
had
been
sent
on
some
errand
of
the
mistress
i
found
him
lying
on
the
cabin
floor
his
clothes
saturated
with
blood
he
informed
me
that
he
had
been
stabbed
while
spreading
cotton
on
the
scaffold
epps
came
home
intoxicated
from
holmesville
he
found
fault
with
every
thing
giving
many
orders
so
directly
contrary
that
it
was
impossible
to
execute
any
of
them
uncle
abram
whose
faculties
were
growing
dull
became
confused
and
committed
some
blunder
of
no
particular
consequence
epps
was
so
enraged
thereat
that
with
drunken
recklessness
he
flew
upon
the
old
man
and
stabbed
him
in
the
back
it
was
a
long
ugly
wound
but
did
not
happen
to
penetrate
far
enough
to
result
fatally
it
was
sewed
up
by
the
mistress
who
censured
her
husband
with
extreme
severity
not
only
denouncing
his
inhumanity
but
declaring
that
she
expected
nothing
else
than
that
he
would
bring
the
family
to
poverty
that
he
would
kill
all
the
slaves
on
the
plantation
in
some
of
his
drunken
fits
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
with
him
to
prostrate
aunt
phebe
with
a
chair
or
stick
of
wood
but
the
most
cruel
whipping
that
ever
i
was
doomed
to
witness
one
i
can
never
recall
with
any
other
emotion
than
that
of
horror
was
inflicted
on
the
unfortunate
patsey
it
has
been
seen
that
the
jealousy
and
hatred
of
mistress
epps
made
the
daily
life
of
her
young
and
agile
slave
completely
miserable
i
am
happy
in
the
belief
that
on
numerous
occasions
i
was
the
means
of
averting
punishment
from
the
inoffensive
girl
in
epps
absence
the
mistress
often
ordered
me
to
whip
her
without
the
remotest
provocation
i
would
refuse
saying
that
i
feared
my
displeasure
and
several
times
ventured
to
remonstrate
with
her
against
the
treatment
patsey
received
i
endeavored
to
impress
her
with
the
truth
that
the
latter
was
not
responsible
for
the
acts
of
which
she
complained
but
that
she
being
a
slave
and
subject
entirely
to
her
master
will
he
alone
was
answerable
at
length
the
monster
crept
into
the
soul
of
epps
also
and
then
it
was
that
he
joined
with
his
wrathful
wife
in
an
infernal
jubilee
over
the
girl
miseries
on
a
sabbath
day
in
hoeing
time
not
long
ago
we
were
on
the
bayou
bank
washing
our
clothes
as
was
our
usual
custom
presently
patsey
was
missing
epps
called
aloud
but
there
was
no
answer
no
one
had
observed
her
leaving
the
yard
and
it
was
a
wonder
with
us
whither
she
had
gone
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
hours
she
was
seen
approaching
from
the
direction
of
shaw
this
man
as
has
been
intimated
was
a
notorious
profligate
and
withal
not
on
the
most
friendly
terms
with
epps
harriet
his
black
wife
knowing
patsey
troubles
was
kind
to
her
in
consequence
of
which
the
latter
was
in
the
habit
of
going
over
to
see
her
every
opportunity
her
visits
were
prompted
by
friendship
merely
but
the
suspicion
gradually
entered
the
brain
of
epps
that
another
and
a
baser
passion
led
her
thither
that
it
was
not
harriet
she
desired
to
meet
but
rather
the
unblushing
libertine
his
neighbor
patsey
found
her
master
in
a
fearful
rage
on
her
return
his
violence
so
alarmed
her
that
at
first
she
attempted
to
evade
direct
answers
to
his
questions
which
only
served
to
increase
his
suspicions
she
finally
however
drew
herself
up
proudly
and
in
a
spirit
of
indignation
boldly
denied
his
charges
missus
do
give
me
soap
to
wash
with
as
she
does
the
rest
said
patsey
and
you
know
why
i
went
over
to
harriet
to
get
a
piece
and
saying
this
she
drew
it
forth
from
a
pocket
in
her
dress
and
exhibited
it
to
him
that
what
i
went
to
shaw
for
massa
epps
continued
she
the
lord
knows
that
was
all
you
lie
you
black
wench
shouted
epps
i
lie
massa
if
you
kill
me
i
stick
to
that
oh
i
fetch
you
down
i
learn
you
to
go
to
shaw
i
take
the
starch
out
of
ye
he
muttered
fiercely
through
his
shut
teeth
then
turning
to
me
he
ordered
four
stakes
to
be
driven
into
the
ground
pointing
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
to
the
places
where
he
wanted
them
when
the
stakes
were
driven
down
he
ordered
her
to
be
stripped
of
every
article
of
dress
ropes
were
then
brought
and
the
naked
girl
was
laid
upon
her
face
her
wrists
and
feet
each
tied
firmly
to
a
stake
stepping
to
the
piazza
he
took
down
a
heavy
whip
and
placing
it
in
my
hands
commanded
me
to
lash
her
unpleasant
as
it
was
i
was
compelled
to
obey
him
nowhere
that
day
on
the
face
of
the
whole
earth
i
venture
to
say
was
there
such
a
demoniac
exhibition
witnessed
as
then
ensued
mistress
epps
stood
on
the
piazza
among
her
children
gazing
on
the
scene
with
an
air
of
heartless
satisfaction
the
slaves
were
huddled
together
at
a
little
distance
their
countenances
indicating
the
sorrow
of
their
hearts
poor
patsey
prayed
piteously
for
mercy
but
her
prayers
were
vain
epps
ground
his
teeth
and
stamped
upon
the
ground
screaming
at
me
like
a
mad
fiend
to
strike
strike
harder
or
turn
will
come
next
you
scoundrel
he
yelled
oh
mercy
massa
oh
have
mercy
oh
god
pity
me
patsey
exclaimed
continually
struggling
fruitlessly
and
the
flesh
quivering
at
every
stroke
when
i
had
struck
her
as
many
as
thirty
times
i
stopped
and
turned
round
toward
epps
hoping
he
was
satisfied
but
with
bitter
oaths
and
threats
he
ordered
me
to
continue
i
inflicted
ten
or
fifteen
blows
more
by
this
time
her
back
was
covered
with
long
welts
intersecting
each
other
like
net
work
epps
was
yet
furious
and
savage
as
ever
demanding
if
she
would
like
to
go
to
shaw
again
and
swearing
he
would
flog
her
until
she
wished
she
was
in
h
throwing
down
the
whip
i
declared
i
could
punish
her
no
more
he
ordered
me
to
go
on
threatening
me
with
a
severer
flogging
than
she
had
received
in
case
of
refusal
my
heart
revolted
at
the
inhuman
scene
and
risking
the
consequences
i
absolutely
refused
to
raise
the
whip
he
then
seized
it
himself
and
applied
it
with
greater
force
than
i
had
the
painful
cries
and
shrieks
of
the
tortured
patsey
mingling
with
the
loud
and
angry
curses
of
epps
loaded
the
air
she
was
terribly
lacerated
i
may
say
without
exaggeration
literally
flayed
the
lash
was
wet
with
blood
which
flowed
down
her
sides
and
dropped
upon
the
ground
at
length
she
ceased
struggling
her
head
sank
listlessly
on
the
ground
her
screams
and
supplications
gradually
decreased
and
died
away
into
a
low
moan
she
no
longer
writhed
and
shrank
beneath
the
lash
when
it
bit
out
small
pieces
of
her
flesh
i
thought
that
she
was
dying
illustration
the
staking
out
and
flogging
of
the
girl
patsey
it
was
the
sabbath
of
the
lord
the
fields
smiled
in
the
warm
sunlight
the
birds
chirped
merrily
amidst
the
foliage
of
the
trees
peace
and
happiness
seemed
to
reign
everywhere
save
in
the
bosoms
of
epps
and
his
panting
victim
and
the
silent
witnesses
around
him
the
tempestuous
emotions
that
were
raging
there
were
little
in
harmony
with
the
calm
and
quiet
beauty
of
the
day
i
could
look
on
epps
only
with
unutterable
loathing
and
abhorrence
and
thought
within
myself
thou
devil
sooner
or
later
somewhere
in
the
course
of
eternal
justice
thou
shalt
answer
for
this
sin
finally
he
ceased
whipping
from
mere
exhaustion
and
ordered
phebe
to
bring
a
bucket
of
salt
and
water
after
washing
her
thoroughly
with
this
i
was
told
to
take
her
to
her
cabin
untying
the
ropes
i
raised
her
in
my
arms
she
was
unable
to
stand
and
as
her
head
rested
on
my
shoulder
she
repeated
many
times
in
a
faint
voice
scarcely
perceptible
oh
platt
oh
platt
but
nothing
further
her
dress
was
replaced
but
it
clung
to
her
back
and
was
soon
stiff
with
blood
we
laid
her
on
some
boards
in
the
hut
where
she
remained
a
long
time
with
eyes
closed
and
groaning
in
agony
at
night
phebe
applied
melted
tallow
to
her
wounds
and
so
far
as
we
were
able
all
endeavored
to
assist
and
console
her
day
after
day
she
lay
in
her
cabin
upon
her
face
the
sores
preventing
her
resting
in
any
other
position
a
blessed
thing
it
would
have
been
for
her
days
and
weeks
and
months
of
misery
it
would
have
saved
her
had
she
never
lifted
up
her
head
in
life
again
indeed
from
that
time
forward
she
was
not
what
she
had
been
the
burden
of
a
deep
melancholy
weighed
heavily
on
her
spirits
she
no
longer
moved
with
that
buoyant
and
elastic
step
there
was
not
that
mirthful
sparkle
in
her
eyes
that
formerly
distinguished
her
the
bounding
vigor
the
sprightly
spirit
of
her
youth
were
gone
she
fell
into
a
mournful
and
desponding
mood
and
oftentimes
would
start
up
in
her
sleep
and
with
raised
hands
plead
for
mercy
she
became
more
silent
than
she
was
toiling
all
day
in
our
midst
not
uttering
a
word
a
pitiful
expression
settled
on
her
face
and
it
was
her
humor
now
to
weep
rather
than
rejoice
if
ever
there
was
a
broken
heart
one
crushed
and
blighted
by
the
rude
grasp
of
suffering
and
misfortune
it
was
patsey
she
had
been
reared
no
better
than
her
master
beast
looked
upon
merely
as
a
valuable
and
handsome
animal
and
consequently
possessed
but
a
limited
amount
of
knowledge
and
yet
a
faint
light
cast
its
rays
over
her
intellect
so
that
it
was
not
wholly
dark
she
had
a
dim
perception
of
god
and
of
eternity
and
a
still
more
dim
perception
of
a
saviour
who
had
died
even
for
such
as
her
she
entertained
but
confused
notions
of
a
future
life
not
comprehending
the
distinction
between
the
corporeal
and
spiritual
existence
happiness
in
her
mind
was
exemption
from
stripes
from
labor
from
the
cruelty
of
masters
and
overseers
her
idea
of
the
joy
of
heaven
was
simply
and
is
fully
expressed
in
these
lines
of
a
melancholy
bard
i
ask
no
paradise
on
high
with
cares
on
earth
oppressed
the
only
heaven
for
which
i
sigh
is
rest
eternal
rest
it
is
a
mistaken
opinion
that
prevails
in
some
quarters
that
the
slave
does
not
understand
the
term
does
not
comprehend
the
idea
of
freedom
even
on
bayou
boeuf
where
i
conceive
slavery
exists
in
its
most
abject
and
cruel
form
where
it
exhibits
features
altogether
unknown
in
more
northern
states
the
most
ignorant
of
them
generally
know
full
well
its
meaning
they
understand
the
privileges
and
exemptions
that
belong
to
it
that
it
would
bestow
upon
them
the
fruits
of
their
own
labors
and
that
it
would
secure
to
them
the
enjoyment
of
domestic
happiness
they
do
not
fail
to
observe
the
difference
between
their
own
condition
and
the
meanest
white
man
and
to
realize
the
injustice
of
the
laws
which
place
it
in
his
power
not
only
to
appropriate
the
profits
of
their
industry
but
to
subject
them
to
unmerited
and
unprovoked
punishment
without
remedy
or
the
right
to
resist
or
to
remonstrate
patsey
life
especially
after
her
whipping
was
one
long
dream
of
liberty
far
away
to
her
fancy
an
immeasurable
distance
she
knew
there
was
a
land
of
freedom
a
thousand
times
she
had
heard
that
somewhere
in
the
distant
north
there
were
no
slaves
no
masters
in
her
imagination
it
was
an
enchanted
region
the
paradise
of
the
earth
to
dwell
where
the
black
man
may
work
for
himself
live
in
his
own
cabin
till
his
own
soil
was
a
blissful
dream
of
patsey
a
dream
alas
the
fulfillment
of
which
she
can
never
realize

in
him
in
the
month
of
june
in
pursuance
of
a
previous
contract
avery
a
carpenter
of
bayou
rouge
commenced
the
erection
of
a
house
for
master
epps
it
has
previously
been
stated
that
there
are
no
cellars
on
bayou
boeuf
on
the
other
hand
such
is
the
low
and
swampy
nature
of
the
ground
the
great
houses
are
usually
built
upon
spiles
another
peculiarity
is
the
rooms
are
not
plastered
but
the
ceiling
and
sides
are
covered
with
matched
cypress
boards
painted
such
color
as
most
pleases
the
owner
taste
generally
the
plank
and
boards
are
sawed
by
slaves
with
there
being
no
waterpower
upon
which
mills
might
be
built
within
many
miles
when
the
planter
erects
for
himself
a
dwelling
therefore
there
is
plenty
of
extra
work
for
his
slaves
having
had
some
experience
under
tibeats
as
a
carpenter
i
was
taken
from
the
field
altogether
on
the
arrival
of
avery
and
his
hands
among
them
was
one
to
whom
i
owe
an
immeasurable
debt
of
gratitude
only
for
him
in
all
probability
i
should
have
ended
my
days
in
slavery
he
was
my
deliverer
a
man
whose
true
heart
overflowed
with
noble
and
generous
emotions
to
the
last
moment
of
my
existence
i
shall
remember
him
with
feelings
of
thankfulness
his
name
was
bass
and
at
that
time
he
resided
in
marksville
it
will
be
difficult
to
convey
a
correct
impression
of
his
appearance
or
character
he
was
a
large
man
between
forty
and
fifty
years
old
of
light
complexion
and
light
hair
he
was
very
cool
and
fond
of
argument
but
always
speaking
with
extreme
deliberation
he
was
that
kind
of
person
whose
peculiarity
of
manner
was
such
that
nothing
he
uttered
ever
gave
offence
what
would
be
intolerable
coming
from
the
lips
of
another
could
be
said
by
him
with
impunity
there
was
not
a
man
on
red
river
perhaps
that
agreed
with
him
on
the
subject
of
politics
or
religion
and
not
a
man
i
venture
to
say
who
discussed
either
of
those
subjects
half
as
much
it
seemed
to
be
taken
for
granted
that
he
would
espouse
the
unpopular
side
of
every
local
question
and
it
always
created
amusement
rather
than
displeasure
among
his
auditors
to
listen
to
the
ingenious
and
original
manner
in
which
he
maintained
the
controversy
he
was
a
bachelor
an
old
bachelor
according
to
the
true
acceptation
of
the
term
having
no
kindred
living
as
he
knew
of
in
the
world
neither
had
he
any
permanent
abiding
place
wandering
from
one
state
to
another
as
his
fancy
dictated
he
had
lived
in
marksville
three
or
four
years
and
in
the
prosecution
of
his
business
as
a
carpenter
and
in
consequence
likewise
of
his
peculiarities
was
quite
extensively
known
throughout
the
parish
of
avoyelles
he
was
liberal
to
a
fault
and
his
many
acts
of
kindness
and
transparent
goodness
of
heart
rendered
him
popular
in
the
community
the
sentiment
of
which
he
unceasingly
combated
he
was
a
native
of
canada
from
whence
he
had
wandered
in
early
life
and
after
visiting
all
the
principal
localities
in
the
northern
and
western
states
in
the
course
of
his
peregrinations
arrived
in
the
unhealthy
region
of
the
red
river
his
last
removal
was
from
illinois
whither
he
has
now
gone
i
regret
to
be
obliged
to
say
is
unknown
to
me
he
gathered
up
his
effects
and
departed
quietly
from
marksville
the
day
before
i
did
the
suspicions
of
his
instrumentality
in
procuring
my
liberation
rendering
such
a
step
necessary
for
the
commission
of
a
just
and
righteous
act
he
would
undoubtedly
have
suffered
death
had
he
remained
within
reach
of
the
tribe
on
bayou
boeuf
one
day
while
working
on
the
new
house
bass
and
epps
became
engaged
in
a
controversy
to
which
as
will
be
readily
supposed
i
listened
with
absorbing
interest
they
were
discussing
the
subject
of
slavery
i
tell
you
what
it
is
epps
said
bass
it
all
wrong
all
wrong
sir
there
no
justice
nor
righteousness
in
it
i
would
own
a
slave
if
i
was
rich
as
croesus
which
i
am
not
as
is
perfectly
well
understood
more
particularly
among
my
creditors
another
humbug
the
credit
system
humbug
sir
no
credit
no
debt
credit
leads
a
man
into
temptation
cash
down
is
the
only
thing
that
will
deliver
him
from
evil
but
this
question
of
what
have
you
to
your
niggers
when
you
come
down
to
the
point
what
right
said
epps
laughing
why
i
bought
and
paid
for
of
you
did
the
law
says
you
have
the
right
to
hold
a
nigger
but
begging
the
law
pardon
it
yes
epps
when
the
law
says
that
it
a
and
the
truth
is
not
in
it
is
every
thing
right
because
the
law
allows
it
suppose
they
pass
a
law
taking
away
your
liberty
and
making
you
a
slave
oh
that
ai
a
supposable
case
said
epps
still
laughing
hope
you
do
compare
me
to
a
nigger
bass
well
bass
answered
gravely
no
not
exactly
but
i
have
seen
niggers
before
now
as
good
as
i
am
and
i
have
no
acquaintance
with
any
white
man
in
these
parts
that
i
consider
a
whit
better
than
myself
now
in
the
sight
of
god
what
is
the
difference
epps
between
a
white
man
and
a
black
one
all
the
difference
in
the
world
replied
epps
you
might
as
well
ask
what
the
difference
is
between
a
white
man
and
a
baboon
now
i
seen
one
of
them
critters
in
orleans
that
knowed
just
as
much
as
any
nigger
i
got
you
call
them
feller
citizens
i
and
epps
indulged
in
a
loud
laugh
at
his
own
wit
look
here
epps
continued
his
companion
you
ca
laugh
me
down
in
that
way
some
men
are
witty
and
some
ai
so
witty
as
they
think
they
are
now
let
me
ask
you
a
question
are
all
men
created
free
and
equal
as
the
declaration
of
independence
holds
they
are
yes
responded
epps
but
all
men
niggers
and
monkeys
and
hereupon
he
broke
forth
into
a
more
boisterous
laugh
than
before
there
are
monkeys
among
white
people
as
well
as
black
when
you
come
to
that
coolly
remarked
bass
i
know
some
white
men
that
use
arguments
no
sensible
monkey
would
but
let
that
pass
these
niggers
are
human
beings
if
they
do
know
as
much
as
their
masters
whose
fault
is
it
they
are
not
to
know
anything
you
have
books
and
papers
and
can
go
where
you
please
and
gather
intelligence
in
a
thousand
ways
but
your
slaves
have
no
privileges
you
whip
one
of
them
if
caught
reading
a
book
they
are
held
in
bondage
generation
after
generation
deprived
of
mental
improvement
and
who
can
expect
them
to
possess
much
knowledge
if
they
are
not
brought
down
to
a
level
with
the
brute
creation
you
slaveholders
will
never
be
blamed
for
it
if
they
are
baboons
or
stand
no
higher
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
than
such
animals
you
and
men
like
you
will
have
to
answer
for
it
there
a
sin
a
fearful
sin
resting
on
this
nation
that
will
not
go
unpunished
forever
there
will
be
a
reckoning
yet
yes
epps
there
a
day
coming
that
will
burn
as
an
oven
it
may
be
sooner
or
it
may
be
later
but
it
a
coming
as
sure
as
the
lord
is
just
if
you
lived
up
among
the
yankees
in
said
epps
i
expect
you
be
one
of
them
cursed
fanatics
that
know
more
than
the
constitution
and
go
about
peddling
clocks
and
coaxing
niggers
to
run
away
if
i
was
in
returned
bass
i
would
be
just
what
i
am
here
i
would
say
that
slavery
was
an
iniquity
and
ought
to
be
abolished
i
would
say
there
was
no
reason
nor
justice
in
the
law
or
the
constitution
that
allows
one
man
to
hold
another
man
in
bondage
it
would
be
hard
for
you
to
lose
your
property
to
be
sure
but
it
would
be
half
as
hard
as
it
would
be
to
lose
your
liberty
you
have
no
more
right
to
your
freedom
in
exact
justice
than
uncle
abram
yonder
talk
about
black
skin
and
black
blood
why
how
many
slaves
are
there
on
this
bayou
as
white
as
either
of
us
and
what
difference
is
there
in
the
color
of
the
soul
pshaw
the
whole
system
is
as
absurd
as
it
is
cruel
you
may
own
niggers
and
behanged
but
i
would
own
one
for
the
best
plantation
in
louisiana
you
like
to
hear
yourself
talk
bass
better
than
any
man
i
know
of
you
would
argue
that
black
was
white
or
white
black
if
any
body
would
contradict
you
nothing
suits
you
in
this
world
and
i
believe
you
will
be
satisfied
with
the
next
if
you
should
have
your
choice
in
them
conversations
substantially
like
the
foregoing
were
not
unusual
between
the
two
after
this
epps
drawing
him
out
more
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
laugh
at
his
expense
than
with
a
view
of
fairly
discussing
the
merits
of
the
question
he
looked
upon
bass
as
a
man
ready
to
say
anything
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
his
own
voice
as
somewhat
perhaps
contending
against
his
faith
and
judgment
in
order
simply
to
exhibit
his
dexterity
in
argumentation
he
remained
at
epps
through
the
summer
visiting
marksville
generally
once
a
fortnight
the
more
i
saw
of
him
the
more
i
became
convinced
he
was
a
man
in
whom
i
could
confide
nevertheless
my
previous
had
taught
me
to
be
extremely
cautious
it
was
not
my
place
to
speak
to
a
white
man
except
when
spoken
to
but
i
omitted
no
opportunity
of
throwing
myself
in
his
way
and
endeavored
constantly
in
every
possible
manner
to
attract
his
attention
in
the
early
part
of
august
he
and
myself
were
at
work
alone
in
the
house
the
other
carpenters
having
left
and
epps
being
absent
in
the
field
now
was
the
time
if
ever
to
broach
the
subject
and
i
resolved
to
do
it
and
submit
to
whatever
consequences
might
ensue
we
were
busily
at
work
in
the
afternoon
when
i
stopped
suddenly
and
said
master
bass
i
want
to
ask
you
what
part
of
the
country
you
came
from
why
platt
what
put
that
into
your
head
he
answered
you
know
if
i
should
tell
you
after
a
moment
or
two
he
added
i
was
born
in
canada
now
guess
where
that
is
oh
i
know
where
canada
is
said
i
i
have
been
there
myself
yes
i
expect
you
are
well
acquainted
all
through
that
country
he
remarked
laughing
incredulously
as
sure
as
i
live
master
bass
i
replied
i
have
been
there
i
have
been
in
montreal
and
kingston
and
queenston
and
a
great
many
places
in
canada
and
i
have
been
in
york
state
too
in
buffalo
and
rochester
and
albany
and
can
tell
you
the
names
of
the
villages
on
the
erie
canal
and
the
champlain
canal
bass
turned
round
and
gazed
at
me
a
long
time
without
uttering
a
syllable
how
came
you
here
he
inquired
at
length
master
bass
i
answered
if
justice
had
been
done
i
never
would
have
been
here
well
how
this
said
he
who
are
you
you
have
been
in
canada
sure
enough
i
know
all
the
places
you
mention
how
did
you
happen
to
get
here
come
tell
me
all
about
it
i
have
no
friends
here
was
my
reply
that
i
can
put
confidence
in
i
am
afraid
to
tell
you
though
i
do
believe
you
would
tell
master
epps
if
i
should
he
assured
me
earnestly
he
would
keep
every
word
i
might
speak
to
him
a
profound
secret
and
his
curiosity
was
evidently
strongly
excited
it
was
a
long
story
i
informed
him
and
would
take
some
time
to
relate
it
master
epps
would
be
back
soon
but
if
he
would
see
me
that
night
after
all
were
asleep
i
would
repeat
it
to
him
he
consented
readily
to
the
arrangement
and
directed
me
to
come
into
the
building
where
we
were
then
at
work
and
i
would
find
him
there
about
midnight
when
all
was
still
and
quiet
i
crept
cautiously
from
my
cabin
and
silently
entering
the
unfinished
building
found
him
awaiting
me
after
further
assurances
on
his
part
that
i
should
not
be
betrayed
i
began
a
relation
of
the
history
of
my
life
and
misfortunes
he
was
deeply
interested
asking
numerous
questions
in
reference
to
localities
and
events
having
ended
my
story
i
besought
him
to
write
to
some
of
my
friends
at
the
north
acquainting
them
with
my
situation
and
begging
them
to
forward
free
papers
or
take
such
steps
as
they
might
consider
proper
to
secure
my
release
he
promised
to
do
so
but
dwelt
upon
the
danger
of
such
an
act
in
case
of
detection
and
now
impressed
upon
me
the
great
necessity
of
strict
silence
and
secresy
before
we
parted
our
plan
of
operation
was
arranged
we
agreed
to
meet
the
next
night
at
a
specified
place
among
the
high
weeds
on
the
bank
of
the
bayou
some
distance
from
master
dwelling
there
he
was
to
write
down
on
paper
the
names
and
address
of
several
persons
old
friends
in
the
north
to
whom
he
would
direct
letters
during
his
next
visit
to
marksville
it
was
not
deemed
prudent
to
meet
in
the
new
house
inasmuch
as
the
light
it
would
be
necessary
to
use
might
possibly
be
discovered
in
the
course
of
the
day
i
managed
to
obtain
a
few
matches
and
a
piece
of
candle
unperceived
from
the
kitchen
during
a
temporary
absence
of
aunt
phebe
bass
had
pencil
and
paper
in
his
tool
chest
at
the
appointed
hour
we
met
on
the
bayou
bank
and
creeping
among
the
high
weeds
i
lighted
the
candle
while
he
drew
forth
pencil
and
paper
and
prepared
for
business
i
gave
him
the
names
of
william
perry
cephas
parker
and
judge
marvin
all
of
saratoga
springs
saratoga
county
i
had
been
employed
by
the
latter
in
the
united
states
hotel
and
had
transacted
business
with
the
former
to
a
considerable
extent
and
trusted
that
at
least
one
of
them
would
be
still
living
at
that
place
he
carefully
wrote
the
names
and
then
remarked
thoughtfully
it
is
so
many
years
since
you
left
saratoga
all
these
men
may
be
dead
or
may
have
removed
you
say
you
obtained
papers
at
the
custom
house
in
probably
there
is
a
record
of
them
there
and
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
write
and
ascertain
i
agreed
with
him
and
again
repeated
the
circumstances
related
heretofore
connected
with
my
visit
to
the
custom
house
with
brown
and
hamilton
we
lingered
on
the
bank
of
the
bayou
an
hour
or
more
conversing
upon
the
subject
which
now
engrossed
our
thoughts
i
could
no
longer
doubt
his
fidelity
and
freely
spoke
to
him
of
the
many
sorrows
i
had
borne
in
silence
and
so
long
i
spoke
of
my
wife
and
children
mentioning
their
names
and
ages
and
dwelling
upon
the
unspeakable
happiness
it
would
be
to
clasp
them
to
my
heart
once
more
before
i
died
i
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
with
tears
and
passionate
entreaties
implored
him
to
befriend
me
to
restore
me
to
my
kindred
and
to
liberty
promising
i
would
weary
heaven
the
remainder
of
my
life
with
prayers
that
it
would
bless
and
prosper
him
in
the
enjoyment
of
freedom
surrounded
by
the
associations
of
youth
and
restored
to
the
bosom
of
my
family
that
promise
is
not
yet
forgotten
nor
shall
it
ever
be
so
long
as
i
have
strength
to
raise
my
imploring
eyes
on
high
oh
blessings
on
his
kindly
voice
and
on
his
silver
hair
and
blessings
on
his
whole
life
long
until
he
meet
me
there
he
overwhelmed
me
with
assurances
of
friendship
and
faithfulness
saying
he
had
never
before
taken
so
deep
an
interest
in
the
fate
of
any
one
he
spoke
of
himself
in
a
somewhat
mournful
tone
as
a
lonely
man
a
wanderer
about
the
world
that
he
was
growing
old
and
must
soon
reach
the
end
of
his
earthly
journey
and
lie
down
to
his
final
rest
without
kith
or
kin
to
mourn
for
him
or
to
remember
him
that
his
life
was
of
little
value
to
himself
and
henceforth
should
be
devoted
to
the
accomplishment
of
my
liberty
and
to
an
unceasing
warfare
against
the
accursed
shame
of
slavery
after
this
time
we
seldom
spoke
to
or
recognized
each
other
he
was
moreover
less
free
in
his
conversation
with
epps
on
the
subject
of
slavery
the
remotest
suspicion
that
there
was
any
unusual
intimacy
any
secret
understanding
between
us
never
once
entered
the
mind
of
epps
or
any
other
person
white
or
black
on
the
plantation
i
am
often
asked
with
an
air
of
incredulity
how
i
succeeded
so
many
years
in
keeping
from
my
daily
and
constant
companions
the
knowledge
of
my
true
name
and
history
the
terrible
lesson
burch
taught
me
impressed
indelibly
upon
my
mind
the
danger
and
uselessness
of
asserting
i
was
a
freeman
there
was
no
possibility
of
any
slave
being
able
to
assist
me
while
on
the
other
hand
there
a
possibility
of
his
exposing
me
when
it
is
recollected
the
whole
current
of
my
thoughts
for
twelve
years
turned
to
the
contemplation
of
escape
it
will
not
be
wondered
at
that
i
was
always
cautious
and
on
my
guard
it
would
have
been
an
act
of
folly
to
have
proclaimed
my
to
freedom
it
would
only
have
subjected
me
to
severer
scrutiny
probably
have
consigned
me
to
some
more
distant
and
inaccessible
region
than
even
bayou
boeuf
edwin
epps
was
a
person
utterly
regardless
of
a
black
man
rights
or
wrongs
utterly
destitute
of
any
natural
sense
of
justice
as
i
well
knew
it
was
important
therefore
not
only
as
regarded
my
hope
of
deliverance
but
also
as
regarded
the
few
personal
privileges
i
was
permitted
to
enjoy
to
keep
from
him
the
history
of
my
life
the
saturday
night
subsequent
to
our
interview
at
the
water
edge
bass
went
home
to
marksville
the
next
day
being
sunday
he
employed
himself
in
his
own
room
writing
letters
one
he
directed
to
the
collector
of
customs
at
another
to
judge
marvin
and
another
to
parker
and
perry
jointly
the
latter
was
the
one
which
led
to
my
recovery
he
subscribed
my
true
name
but
in
the
postscript
intimated
i
was
not
the
writer
the
letter
itself
shows
that
he
considered
himself
engaged
in
a
dangerous
undertaking
no
less
than
running
the
risk
of
his
life
if
detected
i
did
not
see
the
letter
before
it
was
mailed
but
have
since
obtained
a
copy
which
is
here
inserted
bayou
boeuf
august
william
perry
or
cephas
parker
gentlemen
it
having
been
a
long
time
since
i
have
seen
or
heard
from
you
and
not
knowing
that
you
are
living
it
is
with
uncertainty
that
i
write
to
you
but
the
necessity
of
the
case
must
be
my
excuse
having
been
born
free
just
across
the
river
from
you
i
am
certain
you
must
know
me
and
i
am
here
now
a
slave
i
wish
you
to
obtain
free
papers
for
me
and
forward
them
to
me
at
marksville
louisiana
parish
of
avoyelles
and
oblige
yours
solomon
northup
the
way
i
came
to
be
a
slave
i
was
taken
sick
in
washington
city
and
was
insensible
for
some
time
when
i
recovered
my
reason
i
was
robbed
of
my
and
in
irons
on
my
way
to
this
state
and
have
never
been
able
to
get
any
one
to
write
for
me
until
now
and
he
that
is
writing
for
me
runs
the
risk
of
his
life
if
detected
the
allusion
to
myself
in
the
work
recently
issued
entitled
a
key
to
uncle
tom
cabin
contains
the
first
part
of
this
letter
omitting
the
postscript
neither
are
the
full
names
of
the
gentlemen
to
whom
it
is
directed
correctly
stated
there
being
a
slight
discrepancy
probably
a
typographical
error
to
the
postscript
more
than
to
the
body
of
the
communication
am
i
indebted
for
my
liberation
as
will
presently
be
seen
when
bass
returned
from
marksville
he
informed
me
of
what
he
had
done
we
continued
our
midnight
consultations
never
speaking
to
each
other
through
the
day
excepting
as
it
was
necessary
about
the
work
as
nearly
as
he
was
able
to
ascertain
it
would
require
two
weeks
for
the
letter
to
reach
saratoga
in
due
course
of
mail
and
the
same
length
of
time
for
an
answer
to
return
within
six
weeks
at
the
farthest
we
concluded
an
answer
would
arrive
if
it
arrived
at
all
a
great
many
suggestions
were
now
made
and
a
great
deal
of
conversation
took
place
between
us
as
to
the
most
safe
and
proper
course
to
pursue
on
receipt
of
the
free
papers
they
would
stand
between
him
and
harm
in
case
we
were
overtaken
and
arrested
leaving
the
country
altogether
it
would
be
no
infringement
of
law
however
much
it
might
provoke
individual
hostility
to
assist
a
freeman
to
regain
his
freedom
at
the
end
of
four
weeks
he
was
again
at
marksville
but
no
answer
had
arrived
i
was
sorely
disappointed
but
still
reconciled
myself
with
the
reflection
that
sufficient
length
of
time
had
not
yet
elapsed
that
there
might
have
been
delays
and
that
i
could
not
reasonably
expect
one
so
soon
six
seven
eight
and
ten
weeks
passed
by
however
and
nothing
came
i
was
in
a
fever
of
suspense
whenever
bass
visited
marksville
and
could
scarcely
close
my
eyes
until
his
return
finally
my
master
house
was
finished
and
the
time
came
when
bass
must
leave
me
the
night
before
his
departure
i
was
wholly
given
up
to
despair
i
had
clung
to
him
as
a
drowning
man
clings
to
the
floating
spar
knowing
if
it
slips
from
his
grasp
he
must
forever
sink
beneath
the
waves
the
hope
upon
which
i
had
laid
such
eager
hold
was
crumbling
to
ashes
in
my
hands
i
felt
as
if
sinking
down
down
amidst
the
bitter
waters
of
slavery
from
the
unfathomable
depths
of
which
i
should
never
rise
again
the
generous
heart
of
my
friend
and
benefactor
was
touched
with
pity
at
the
sight
of
my
distress
he
endeavored
to
cheer
me
up
promising
to
return
the
day
before
christmas
and
if
no
intelligence
was
received
in
the
meantime
some
further
step
would
be
undertaken
to
effect
our
design
he
exhorted
me
to
keep
up
my
spirits
to
rely
upon
his
continued
efforts
in
my
behalf
assuring
me
in
most
earnest
and
impressive
language
that
my
liberation
should
from
thenceforth
be
the
chief
object
of
his
thoughts
in
his
absence
the
time
passed
slowly
indeed
i
looked
forward
to
christmas
with
intense
anxiety
and
impatience
i
had
about
given
up
the
expectation
of
receiving
any
answer
to
the
letters
they
might
have
miscarried
or
might
have
been
misdirected
perhaps
those
at
saratoga
to
whom
they
had
been
addressed
were
all
dead
perhaps
engaged
in
their
pursuits
they
did
not
consider
the
fate
of
an
obscure
unhappy
black
man
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
noticed
my
whole
reliance
was
in
bass
the
faith
i
had
in
him
was
continually
me
and
enabled
me
to
stand
up
against
the
tide
of
disappointment
that
had
overwhelmed
me
so
wholly
was
i
absorbed
in
reflecting
upon
my
situation
and
prospects
that
the
hands
with
whom
i
labored
in
the
field
often
observed
it
patsey
would
ask
me
if
i
was
sick
and
uncle
abram
and
bob
and
wiley
frequently
expressed
a
curiosity
to
know
what
i
could
be
thinking
about
so
steadily
but
i
evaded
their
inquiries
with
some
light
remark
and
kept
my
thoughts
locked
closely
in
my
breast
chapter
xx
bass
faithful
to
his
word
his
arrival
on
christmas
eve
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
an
interview
the
meeting
in
the
cabin
of
the
letter
bass
announces
his
intention
to
proceed

between
epps
and
bass
young

and

william

oversleep
myself
the
last
whipping
despondency
the
cold
morning
threats
the
passing
carriage
strangers
approaching
through
the
last
hour
on
bayou
boeuf
faithful
to
his
word
the
day
before
christmas
just
at
bass
came
riding
into
the
yard
how
are
you
said
epps
shaking
him
by
the
hand
glad
to
see
you
he
would
not
have
been
glad
had
he
known
the
object
of
his
errand
quite
well
quite
well
answered
bass
had
some
business
out
on
the
bayou
and
concluded
to
call
and
see
you
and
stay
over
night
epps
ordered
one
of
the
slaves
to
take
charge
of
his
horse
and
with
much
talk
and
laughter
they
passed
into
the
house
together
not
however
until
bass
had
looked
at
me
significantly
as
much
as
to
say
keep
dark
we
understand
each
other
it
was
ten
at
night
before
the
labors
of
the
day
were
performed
when
i
entered
the
cabin
at
that
time
uncle
abram
and
bob
occupied
it
with
me
i
laid
down
upon
my
board
and
feigned
i
was
asleep
when
my
companions
had
fallen
into
a
profound
slumber
i
moved
stealthily
out
of
the
door
and
watched
and
listened
attentively
for
some
sign
or
sound
from
bass
there
i
stood
until
long
after
midnight
but
nothing
could
be
seen
or
heard
as
i
suspected
he
dared
not
leave
the
house
through
fear
of
exciting
the
suspicion
of
some
of
the
family
i
judged
correctly
he
would
rise
earlier
than
was
his
custom
and
take
the
opportunity
of
seeing
me
before
epps
was
up
accordingly
i
aroused
uncle
abram
an
hour
sooner
than
usual
and
sent
him
into
the
house
to
build
a
fire
which
at
that
season
of
the
year
is
a
part
of
uncle
abram
duties
i
also
gave
bob
a
violent
shake
and
asked
him
if
he
intended
to
sleep
till
noon
saying
master
would
be
up
before
the
mules
were
fed
he
knew
right
well
the
consequence
that
would
follow
such
an
event
and
jumping
to
his
feet
was
at
the
in
a
twinkling
presently
when
both
were
gone
bass
slipped
into
the
cabin
no
letter
yet
platt
said
he
the
announcement
fell
upon
my
heart
like
lead
oh
write
again
master
bass
i
cried
i
will
give
you
the
names
of
a
great
many
i
know
surely
they
are
not
all
dead
surely
some
one
will
pity
me
no
use
bass
replied
no
use
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
that
i
fear
the
marksville
will
mistrust
something
i
have
inquired
so
often
at
his
office
too
uncertain
too
dangerous
then
it
is
all
over
i
exclaimed
oh
my
god
how
can
i
end
my
days
here
you
not
going
to
end
them
here
he
said
unless
you
die
very
soon
i
thought
this
matter
all
over
and
have
come
to
a
determination
there
are
more
ways
than
one
to
manage
this
business
and
a
better
and
surer
way
than
writing
letters
i
have
a
job
or
two
on
hand
which
can
be
completed
by
march
or
april
by
that
time
i
shall
have
a
considerable
sum
of
money
and
then
platt
i
am
going
to
saratoga
myself
i
could
scarcely
credit
my
own
senses
as
the
words
fell
from
his
lips
but
he
assured
me
in
a
manner
that
left
no
doubt
of
the
sincerity
of
his
intention
that
if
his
life
was
spared
until
spring
he
should
certainly
undertake
the
journey
i
have
lived
in
this
region
long
enough
he
continued
i
may
as
well
be
in
one
place
as
another
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
thinking
of
going
back
once
more
to
the
place
where
i
was
born
i
tired
of
slavery
as
well
as
you
if
i
can
succeed
in
getting
you
away
from
here
it
will
be
a
good
act
that
i
shall
like
to
think
of
all
my
life
and
i
succeed
platt
i
to
do
it
now
let
me
tell
you
what
i
want
epps
will
be
up
soon
and
it
wo
do
to
be
caught
here
think
of
a
great
many
men
at
saratoga
and
sandy
hill
and
in
that
neighborhood
who
once
knew
you
i
shall
make
excuse
to
come
here
again
in
the
course
of
the
winter
when
i
will
write
down
their
names
i
will
then
know
who
to
call
on
when
i
go
north
think
of
all
you
can
cheer
up
do
be
discouraged
i
with
you
life
or
death
god
bless
you
and
saying
this
he
left
the
cabin
quickly
and
entered
the
great
house
it
was
christmas
morning
the
happiest
day
in
the
whole
year
for
the
slave
that
morning
he
need
not
hurry
to
the
field
with
his
gourd
and
happiness
sparkled
in
the
eyes
and
overspread
the
countenances
of
all
the
time
of
feasting
and
dancing
had
come
the
cane
and
cotton
fields
were
deserted
that
day
the
clean
dress
was
to
be
donned
the
red
ribbon
displayed
there
were
to
be
and
joy
and
laughter
and
hurrying
to
and
fro
it
was
to
be
a
day
of
among
the
children
of
slavery
wherefore
they
were
happy
and
rejoiced
after
breakfast
epps
and
bass
sauntered
about
the
yard
conversing
upon
the
price
of
cotton
and
various
other
topics
where
do
your
niggers
hold
christmas
bass
inquired
platt
is
going
to
tanners
his
fiddle
is
in
great
demand
they
want
him
at
marshall
monday
and
miss
mary
mccoy
on
the
old
norwood
plantation
writes
me
a
note
that
she
wants
him
to
play
for
her
niggers
tuesday
he
is
rather
a
smart
boy
ai
he
said
bass
come
here
platt
he
added
looking
at
me
as
i
walked
up
to
them
as
if
he
had
never
thought
before
to
take
any
special
notice
of
me
yes
replied
epps
taking
hold
of
my
arm
and
feeling
it
there
is
a
bad
joint
in
him
there
ai
a
boy
on
the
bayou
worth
more
than
he
is
perfectly
sound
and
no
bad
tricks
d
n
him
he
like
other
niggers
does
look
like
do
act
like
i
was
offered
seventeen
hundred
dollars
for
him
last
week
and
did
take
it
bass
inquired
with
an
air
of
surprise
take
it
no
devilish
clear
of
it
why
he
a
genius
can
make
a
plough
beam
wagon
tongue
anything
as
well
as
you
can
marshall
wanted
to
put
up
one
of
his
niggers
agin
him
and
raffle
for
them
but
i
told
him
i
would
see
the
devil
have
him
first
i
do
see
anything
remarkable
about
him
bass
observed
why
just
feel
of
him
now
epps
rejoined
you
do
see
a
boy
very
often
put
together
any
closer
than
he
is
he
a
cuss
and
wo
bear
as
much
whipping
as
some
but
he
got
the
muscle
in
him
and
no
mistake
bass
felt
of
me
turned
me
round
and
made
a
thorough
examination
epps
all
the
while
dwelling
on
my
good
points
but
his
visitor
seemed
to
take
but
little
interest
finally
in
the
subject
and
consequently
it
was
dropped
bass
soon
departed
giving
me
another
sly
look
of
recognition
and
significance
as
he
trotted
out
of
the
yard
when
he
was
gone
i
obtained
a
pass
and
started
for
tanner
not
peter
tanner
of
whom
mention
has
previously
been
made
but
a
relative
of
his
i
played
during
the
day
and
most
of
the
night
spending
the
next
day
sunday
in
my
cabin
monday
i
crossed
the
bayou
to
douglas
marshall
all
epps
slaves
accompanying
me
and
on
tuesday
went
to
the
old
norwood
place
which
is
the
third
plantation
above
marshall
on
the
same
side
of
the
water
this
estate
is
now
owned
by
miss
mary
mccoy
a
lovely
girl
some
twenty
years
of
age
she
is
the
beauty
and
the
glory
of
bayou
boeuf
she
owns
about
a
hundred
working
hands
besides
a
great
many
house
servants
yard
boys
and
young
children
her
who
resides
on
the
adjoining
estate
is
her
general
agent
she
is
beloved
by
all
her
slaves
and
good
reason
indeed
have
they
to
be
thankful
that
they
have
fallen
into
such
gentle
hands
nowhere
on
the
bayou
are
there
such
feasts
such
merrymaking
as
at
young
madam
mccoy
thither
more
than
to
any
other
place
do
the
old
and
the
young
for
miles
around
love
to
repair
in
the
time
of
the
christmas
holidays
for
nowhere
else
can
they
find
such
delicious
repasts
nowhere
else
can
they
hear
a
voice
speaking
to
them
so
pleasantly
no
one
is
so
well
beloved
no
one
fills
so
large
a
space
in
the
hearts
of
a
thousand
slaves
as
young
madam
mccoy
the
orphan
mistress
of
the
old
norwood
estate
on
my
arrival
at
her
place
i
found
two
or
three
hundred
had
assembled
the
table
was
prepared
in
a
long
building
which
she
had
erected
expressly
for
her
slaves
to
dance
in
it
was
covered
with
every
variety
of
food
the
country
afforded
and
was
pronounced
by
general
acclamation
to
be
the
rarest
of
dinners
roast
turkey
pig
chicken
duck
and
all
kinds
of
meat
baked
boiled
and
broiled
formed
a
line
the
whole
length
of
the
extended
table
while
the
vacant
spaces
were
filled
with
tarts
jellies
and
frosted
cake
and
pastry
of
many
kinds
the
young
mistress
walked
around
the
table
smiling
and
saying
a
kind
word
to
each
one
and
seemed
to
enjoy
the
scene
exceedingly
when
the
dinner
was
over
the
tables
were
removed
to
make
room
for
the
dancers
i
tuned
my
violin
and
struck
up
a
lively
air
while
some
joined
in
a
nimble
reel
others
patted
and
sang
their
simple
but
melodious
songs
filling
the
great
room
with
music
mingled
with
the
sound
of
human
voices
and
the
clatter
of
many
feet
in
the
evening
the
mistress
returned
and
stood
in
the
door
a
long
time
looking
at
us
she
was
magnificently
arrayed
her
dark
hair
and
eyes
contrasted
strongly
with
her
clear
and
delicate
complexion
her
form
was
slender
but
commanding
and
her
movement
was
a
combination
of
unaffected
dignity
and
grace
as
she
stood
there
clad
in
her
rich
apparel
her
face
animated
with
pleasure
i
thought
i
had
never
looked
upon
a
human
being
half
so
beautiful
i
dwell
with
delight
upon
the
description
of
this
fair
and
gentle
lady
not
only
because
she
inspired
me
with
emotions
of
gratitude
and
admiration
but
because
i
would
have
the
reader
understand
that
all
on
bayou
boeuf
are
not
like
epps
or
tibeats
or
jim
burns
occasionally
can
be
found
rarely
it
may
be
indeed
a
good
man
like
william
ford
or
an
angel
of
kindness
like
young
mistress
mccoy
tuesday
concluded
the
three
holidays
epps
yearly
allowed
us
on
my
way
home
wednesday
morning
while
passing
the
plantation
of
william
pierce
that
gentleman
hailed
me
saying
he
had
received
a
line
from
epps
brought
down
by
william
varnell
permitting
him
to
detain
me
for
the
purpose
of
playing
for
his
slaves
that
night
it
was
the
last
time
i
was
destined
to
witness
a
slave
dance
on
the
shores
of
bayou
boeuf
the
party
at
pierce
continued
their
jollification
until
broad
daylight
when
i
returned
to
my
master
house
somewhat
wearied
with
the
loss
of
rest
but
rejoicing
in
the
possession
of
numerous
bits
and
picayunes
which
the
whites
who
were
pleased
with
my
musical
performances
had
contributed
on
saturday
morning
for
the
first
time
in
years
i
overslept
myself
i
was
frightened
on
coming
out
of
the
cabin
to
find
the
slaves
were
already
in
the
field
they
had
preceded
me
some
fifteen
minutes
leaving
my
dinner
and
i
hurried
after
them
as
fast
as
i
could
move
it
was
not
yet
sunrise
but
epps
was
on
the
piazza
as
i
left
the
hut
and
cried
out
to
me
that
it
was
a
pretty
time
of
day
to
be
getting
up
by
extra
exertion
my
row
was
up
when
he
came
out
after
breakfast
this
however
was
no
excuse
for
the
offence
of
oversleeping
bidding
me
strip
and
lie
down
he
gave
me
ten
or
fifteen
lashes
at
the
conclusion
of
which
he
inquired
if
i
thought
after
that
i
could
get
up
sometime
in
the
i
expressed
myself
quite
positively
that
i
and
with
back
stinging
with
pain
went
about
my
work
the
following
day
sunday
my
thoughts
were
upon
bass
and
the
probabilities
and
hopes
which
hung
upon
his
action
and
determination
i
considered
the
uncertainty
of
life
that
if
it
should
be
the
will
of
god
that
he
should
die
my
prospect
of
deliverance
and
all
expectation
of
happiness
in
this
world
would
be
wholly
ended
and
destroyed
my
sore
back
perhaps
did
not
have
a
tendency
to
render
me
unusually
cheerful
i
felt
and
unhappy
all
day
long
and
when
i
laid
down
upon
the
hard
board
at
night
my
heart
was
oppressed
with
such
a
load
of
grief
it
seemed
that
it
must
break
monday
morning
the
third
of
january
we
were
in
the
field
betimes
it
was
a
raw
cold
morning
such
as
is
unusual
in
that
region
i
was
in
advance
uncle
abram
next
to
me
behind
him
bob
patsey
and
wiley
with
our
about
our
necks
epps
happened
a
rare
thing
indeed
to
come
out
that
morning
without
his
whip
he
swore
in
a
manner
that
would
shame
a
pirate
that
we
were
doing
nothing
bob
ventured
to
say
that
his
fingers
were
so
numb
with
cold
he
could
pick
fast
epps
cursed
himself
for
not
having
brought
his
rawhide
and
declared
that
when
he
came
out
again
he
would
warm
us
well
yes
he
would
make
us
all
hotter
than
that
fiery
realm
in
which
i
am
sometimes
compelled
to
believe
he
will
himself
eventually
reside
with
these
fervent
expressions
he
left
us
when
out
of
hearing
we
commenced
talking
to
each
other
saying
how
hard
it
was
to
be
compelled
to
keep
up
our
tasks
with
numb
fingers
how
unreasonable
master
was
and
speaking
of
him
generally
in
no
flattering
terms
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
carriage
passing
rapidly
towards
the
house
looking
up
we
saw
two
men
approaching
us
through
the
having
now
brought
down
this
narrative
to
the
last
hour
i
was
to
spend
on
bayou

gotten
through

last
cotton

in
the

part
of

some
time
previous
to

anne
had
removed
to
glens

county
where
she
had
charge
of
the
kitchen
in

hotel
she
kept
house
however
lodging
with
our
children
and
was
only
absent
from
them
during
such
time
as
the
discharge
of
her
duties
in
the
hotel
required
parker
and
perry
on
receipt
of
the
letter
forwarded
it
immediately
to
anne
on
reading
it
the
children
were
all
excitement
and
without
delay
hastened
to
the
neighboring
village
of
sandy
hill
to
consult
henry
northup
and
obtain
his
advice
and
assistance
in
the
matter
upon
examination
that
gentleman
found
among
the
statutes
of
the
state
an
act
providing
for
the
recovery
of
free
citizens
from
slavery
it
was
passed
may
and
is
entitled
an
act
more
effectually
to
protect
the
free
citizens
of
this
state
from
being
kidnapped
or
reduced
to
slavery
it
provides
that
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
governor
upon
the
receipt
of
satisfactory
information
that
any
free
citizen
or
inhabitant
of
this
state
is
wrongfully
held
in
another
state
or
territory
of
the
united
states
upon
the
allegation
or
pretence
that
such
person
is
a
slave
or
by
color
of
any
usage
or
rule
of
law
is
deemed
or
taken
to
be
a
slave
to
take
such
measures
to
procure
the
restoration
of
such
person
to
liberty
as
he
shall
deem
necessary
and
to
that
end
he
is
authorized
to
appoint
and
employ
an
agent
and
directed
to
furnish
him
with
such
credentials
and
instructions
as
will
be
likely
to
accomplish
the
object
of
his
appointment
it
requires
the
agent
so
appointed
to
proceed
to
collect
the
proper
proof
to
establish
the
right
of
such
person
to
his
freedom
to
perform
such
journeys
take
such
measures
institute
such
legal
proceedings
as
may
be
necessary
to
return
such
person
to
this
state
and
charges
all
expenses
incurred
in
carrying
the
act
into
effect
upon
moneys
not
otherwise
appropriated
in
the
treasury
it
was
necessary
to
establish
two
facts
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
governor
first
that
i
was
a
free
citizen
of
and
secondly
that
i
was
wrongfully
held
in
bondage
as
to
the
first
point
there
was
no
difficulty
all
the
older
inhabitants
in
the
vicinity
being
ready
to
testify
to
it
the
second
point
rested
entirely
upon
the
letter
to
parker
and
perry
written
in
an
unknown
hand
and
upon
the
letter
penned
on
board
the
brig
orleans
which
unfortunately
had
been
mislaid
or
lost
a
memorial
was
prepared
directed
to
his
excellency
governor
hunt
setting
forth
her
marriage
my
departure
to
washington
city
the
receipt
of
the
letters
that
i
was
a
free
citizen
and
such
other
facts
as
were
deemed
important
and
was
signed
and
verified
by
anne
accompanying
this
memorial
were
several
affidavits
of
prominent
citizens
of
sandy
hill
and
fort
edward
corroborating
fully
the
statements
it
contained
and
also
a
request
of
several
well
known
gentlemen
to
the
governor
that
henry
northup
be
appointed
agent
under
the
legislative
act
on
reading
the
memorial
and
affidavits
his
excellency
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
matter
and
on
the
day
of
november
under
the
seal
of
the
state
constituted
appointed
and
employed
henry
northup
an
agent
with
full
power
to
effect
my
restoration
and
to
take
such
measures
as
would
be
most
likely
to
accomplish
it
and
instructing
him
to
proceed
to
louisiana
with
all
convenient
dispatch
the
pressing
nature
of
northup
professional
and
political
engagements
delayed
his
departure
until
december
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
that
month
he
left
sandy
hill
and
proceeded
to
washington
the
hon
pierre
soule
senator
in
congress
from
louisiana
hon
conrad
secretary
of
war
and
judge
nelson
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
upon
hearing
a
statement
of
the
facts
and
examining
his
commission
and
certified
copies
of
the
memorial
and
affidavits
furnished
him
with
open
letters
to
gentlemen
in
louisiana
strongly
urging
their
assistance
in
accomplishing
the
object
of
his
appointment
senator
soule
especially
interested
himself
in
the
matter
insisting
in
forcible
language
that
it
was
the
duty
and
interest
of
every
planter
in
his
state
to
aid
in
restoring
me
to
freedom
and
trusted
the
sentiments
of
honor
and
justice
in
the
bosom
of
every
citizen
of
the
commonwealth
would
enlist
him
at
once
in
my
behalf
having
obtained
these
valuable
letters
northup
returned
to
baltimore
and
proceeded
from
thence
to
pittsburgh
it
was
his
original
intention
under
advice
of
friends
at
washington
to
go
directly
to
new
orleans
and
consult
the
authorities
of
that
city
providentially
however
on
arriving
at
the
mouth
of
red
river
he
changed
his
mind
had
he
continued
on
he
would
not
have
met
with
bass
in
which
case
the
search
for
me
would
probably
have
been
fruitless
taking
passage
on
the
first
steamer
that
arrived
he
pursued
his
journey
up
red
river
a
sluggish
winding
stream
flowing
through
a
vast
region
of
primitive
forests
and
impenetrable
swamps
almost
wholly
destitute
of
inhabitants
about
nine
in
the
forenoon
january
he
left
the
steamboat
at
marksville
and
proceeded
directly
to
marksville
court
house
a
small
village
four
miles
in
the
interior
from
the
fact
that
the
letter
to
parker
and
perry
was
at
marksville
it
was
supposed
by
him
that
i
was
in
that
place
or
its
immediate
vicinity
on
reaching
this
town
he
at
once
laid
his
business
before
the
hon
john
waddill
a
legal
gentleman
of
distinction
and
a
man
of
fine
genius
and
most
noble
impulses
after
reading
the
letters
and
documents
presented
him
and
listening
to
a
representation
of
the
circumstances
under
which
i
had
been
carried
away
into
captivity
waddill
at
once
proffered
his
services
and
entered
into
the
affair
with
great
zeal
and
earnestness
he
in
common
with
others
of
like
elevated
character
looked
upon
the
kidnapper
with
abhorrence
the
title
of
his
fellow
parishioners
and
clients
to
the
property
which
constituted
the
larger
proportion
of
their
wealth
not
only
depended
upon
the
good
faith
in
which
slave
sales
were
transacted
but
he
was
a
man
in
whose
honorable
heart
emotions
of
indignation
were
aroused
by
such
an
instance
of
injustice
marksville
although
occupying
a
prominent
position
and
standing
out
in
impressive
italics
on
the
map
of
louisiana
is
in
fact
but
a
small
and
insignificant
hamlet
aside
from
the
tavern
kept
by
a
jolly
and
generous
boniface
the
court
house
inhabited
by
lawless
cows
and
swine
in
the
seasons
of
vacation
and
a
high
gallows
with
its
dissevered
rope
dangling
in
the
air
there
is
little
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
stranger
solomon
northup
was
a
name
waddill
had
never
heard
but
he
was
confident
that
if
there
was
a
slave
bearing
that
appellation
in
marksville
or
vicinity
his
black
boy
tom
would
know
him
tom
was
accordingly
called
but
in
all
his
extensive
circle
of
acquaintances
there
was
no
such
personage
the
letter
to
parker
and
perry
was
dated
at
bayou
boeuf
at
this
place
therefore
the
conclusion
was
i
must
be
sought
but
here
a
difficulty
suggested
itself
of
a
very
grave
character
indeed
bayou
boeuf
at
its
nearest
point
was
miles
distant
and
was
the
name
applied
to
the
section
of
country
extending
between
fifty
and
a
hundred
miles
on
both
sides
of
that
stream
thousands
and
thousands
of
slaves
resided
upon
its
shores
the
remarkable
richness
and
fertility
of
the
soil
having
attracted
thither
a
great
number
of
planters
the
information
in
the
letter
was
so
vague
and
indefinite
as
to
render
it
difficult
to
conclude
upon
any
specific
course
of
proceeding
it
was
finally
determined
however
as
the
only
plan
that
presented
any
prospect
of
success
that
northup
and
the
brother
of
waddill
a
student
in
the
office
of
the
latter
should
repair
to
the
bayou
and
traveling
up
one
side
and
down
the
other
its
whole
length
inquire
at
each
plantation
for
me
waddill
tendered
the
use
of
his
carriage
and
it
was
definitely
arranged
that
they
should
start
upon
the
excursion
early
monday
morning
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
this
course
in
all
probability
would
have
resulted
unsuccessfully
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
have
gone
into
the
fields
and
examine
all
the
gangs
at
work
they
were
not
aware
that
i
was
known
only
as
platt
and
had
they
inquired
of
epps
himself
he
would
have
stated
truly
that
he
knew
nothing
of
solomon
northup
the
arrangement
being
adopted
however
there
was
nothing
further
to
be
done
until
sunday
had
elapsed
the
conversation
between
northup
and
waddill
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
turned
upon
politics
i
can
scarcely
comprehend
the
nice
distinctions
and
shades
of
political
parties
in
your
state
observed
waddill
i
read
of
and
hunkers
and
barnburners
and
and
am
unable
to
understand
the
precise
difference
between
them
pray
what
is
it
northup
his
pipe
entered
into
quite
an
elaborate
narrative
of
the
origin
of
the
various
sections
of
parties
and
concluded
by
saying
there
was
another
party
in
known
as
or
abolitionists
you
have
seen
none
of
those
in
this
part
of
the
country
i
presume
northup
remarked
never
but
one
answered
waddill
laughingly
we
have
one
here
in
marksville
an
eccentric
creature
who
preaches
abolitionism
as
vehemently
as
any
fanatic
at
the
north
he
is
a
generous
inoffensive
man
but
always
maintaining
the
wrong
side
of
an
argument
it
affords
us
a
deal
of
amusement
he
is
an
excellent
mechanic
and
almost
indispensable
in
this
community
he
is
a
carpenter
his
name
is
bass
some
further
conversation
was
had
at
the
expense
of
peculiarities
when
waddill
all
at
once
fell
into
a
reflective
mood
and
asked
for
the
mysterious
letter
again
let
me
see
he
repeated
thoughtfully
to
himself
running
his
eyes
over
the
letter
once
more
boeuf
august
august
here
that
is
writing
for
me
where
did
bass
work
last
summer
he
inquired
turning
suddenly
to
his
brother
his
brother
was
unable
to
inform
him
but
rising
left
the
office
and
soon
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
bass
worked
last
summer
somewhere
on
bayou
boeuf
he
is
the
man
bringing
down
his
hand
emphatically
on
the
table
who
can
tell
us
all
about
solomon
northup
exclaimed
waddill
bass
was
immediately
searched
for
but
could
not
be
found
after
some
inquiry
it
was
ascertained
he
was
at
the
landing
on
red
river
procuring
a
conveyance
young
waddill
and
northup
were
not
long
in
traversing
the
few
miles
to
the
latter
place
on
their
arrival
bass
was
found
just
on
the
point
of
leaving
to
be
absent
a
fortnight
or
more
after
an
introduction
northup
begged
the
privilege
of
speaking
to
him
privately
a
moment
they
walked
together
towards
the
river
when
the
following
conversation
ensued
bass
said
northup
allow
me
to
ask
you
if
you
were
on
bayou
boeuf
last
august
yes
sir
i
was
there
in
august
was
the
reply
did
you
write
a
letter
for
a
colored
man
at
that
place
to
some
gentleman
in
saratoga
springs
excuse
me
sir
if
i
say
that
is
none
of
your
business
answered
bass
stopping
and
looking
his
interrogator
searchingly
in
the
face
perhaps
i
am
rather
hasty
bass
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
have
come
from
the
state
of
to
accomplish
the
purpose
the
writer
of
a
letter
dated
the
of
august
at
marksville
had
in
view
circumstances
have
led
me
to
think
that
you
are
perhaps
the
man
who
wrote
it
i
am
in
search
of
solomon
northup
if
you
know
him
i
beg
you
to
inform
me
frankly
where
he
is
and
i
assure
you
the
source
of
any
information
you
may
give
me
shall
not
be
divulged
if
you
desire
it
not
to
be
a
long
time
bass
looked
his
new
acquaintance
steadily
in
the
eyes
without
opening
his
lips
he
seemed
to
be
doubting
in
his
own
mind
if
there
was
not
an
attempt
to
practice
some
deception
upon
him
finally
he
said
deliberately
i
have
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
i
am
the
man
who
wrote
the
letter
if
you
have
come
to
rescue
solomon
northup
i
am
glad
to
see
you
when
did
you
last
see
him
and
where
is
he
northup
inquired
i
last
saw
him
christmas
a
week
ago
he
is
the
slave
of
edwin
epps
a
planter
on
bayou
boeuf
near
holmesville
he
is
not
known
as
solomon
northup
he
is
called
platt
the
secret
was
out
the
mystery
was
unraveled
through
the
thick
black
cloud
amid
whose
dark
and
dismal
shadows
i
had
walked
twelve
years
broke
the
star
that
was
to
light
me
back
to
liberty
all
mistrust
and
hesitation
were
soon
thrown
aside
and
the
two
men
conversed
long
and
freely
upon
the
subject
uppermost
in
their
thoughts
bass
expressed
the
interest
he
had
taken
in
my
behalf
his
intention
of
going
north
in
the
spring
and
declaring
that
he
had
resolved
to
accomplish
my
emancipation
if
it
were
in
his
power
he
described
the
commencement
and
progress
of
his
acquaintance
with
me
and
listened
with
eager
curiosity
to
the
account
given
him
of
my
family
and
the
history
of
my
early
life
before
separating
he
drew
a
map
of
the
bayou
on
a
strip
of
paper
with
a
piece
of
red
chalk
showing
the
locality
of
epps
plantation
and
the
road
leading
most
directly
to
it
northup
and
his
young
companion
returned
to
marksville
where
it
was
determined
to
commence
legal
proceedings
to
test
the
question
of
my
right
to
freedom
i
was
made
plaintiff
northup
acting
as
my
guardian
and
edwin
epps
defendant
the
process
to
be
issued
was
in
the
nature
of
replevin
directed
to
the
sheriff
of
the
parish
commanding
him
to
take
me
into
custody
and
detain
me
until
the
decision
of
the
court
by
the
time
the
papers
were
duly
drawn
up
it
was
twelve
at
night
too
late
to
obtain
the
necessary
signature
of
the
judge
who
resided
some
distance
out
of
town
further
business
was
therefore
suspended
until
monday
morning
everything
apparently
was
moving
along
swimmingly
until
sunday
afternoon
when
waddill
called
at
northup
room
to
express
his
apprehension
of
difficulties
they
had
not
expected
to
encounter
bass
had
become
alarmed
and
had
placed
his
affairs
in
the
hands
of
a
person
at
the
landing
communicating
to
him
his
intention
of
leaving
the
state
this
person
had
betrayed
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
to
a
certain
extent
and
a
rumor
began
to
float
about
the
town
that
the
stranger
at
the
hotel
who
had
been
observed
in
the
company
of
lawyer
waddill
was
after
one
of
old
epps
slaves
over
on
the
bayou
epps
was
known
at
marksville
having
frequent
occasion
to
visit
that
place
during
the
session
of
the
courts
and
the
fear
entertained
by
northup
adviser
was
that
intelligence
would
be
conveyed
to
him
in
the
night
giving
him
an
opportunity
of
secreting
me
before
the
arrival
of
the
sheriff
this
apprehension
had
the
effect
of
expediting
matters
considerably
the
sheriff
who
lived
in
one
direction
from
the
village
was
requested
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
immediately
after
midnight
while
the
judge
was
informed
he
would
be
called
upon
at
the
same
time
it
is
but
justice
to
say
that
the
authorities
at
marksville
cheerfully
rendered
all
the
assistance
in
their
power
as
soon
after
midnight
as
bail
could
be
perfected
and
the
signature
obtained
a
carriage
containing
northup
and
the
sheriff
driven
by
the
landlord
son
rolled
rapidly
out
of
the
village
of
marksville
on
the
road
towards
bayou
boeuf
it
was
supposed
that
epps
would
contest
the
issue
involving
my
right
to
liberty
and
it
therefore
suggested
itself
to
northup
that
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
describing
my
first
meeting
with
the
former
might
perhaps
become
material
on
the
trial
it
was
accordingly
arranged
during
the
ride
that
before
i
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
northup
the
sheriff
should
propound
to
me
certain
questions
agreed
upon
such
as
the
number
and
names
of
my
children
the
name
of
my
wife
before
marriage
of
places
i
knew
at
the
north
and
so
forth
if
my
answers
corresponded
with
the
statements
given
him
the
evidence
must
necessarily
be
considered
conclusive
at
length
shortly
after
epps
had
left
the
field
with
the
consoling
assurance
that
he
would
soon
return
and
us
as
was
stated
in
the
conclusion
of
the
preceding
chapter
they
came
in
sight
of
the
plantation
and
discovered
us
at
work
alighting
from
the
carriage
and
directing
the
driver
to
proceed
to
the
great
house
with
instructions
not
to
mention
to
any
one
the
object
of
their
errand
until
they
met
again
northup
and
the
sheriff
turned
from
the
highway
and
came
towards
us
across
the
cotton
field
we
observed
them
on
looking
up
at
the
carriage
one
several
rods
in
advance
of
the
other
it
was
a
singular
and
unusual
thing
to
see
white
men
approaching
us
in
that
manner
and
especially
at
that
early
hour
in
the
morning
and
uncle
abram
and
patsey
made
some
remarks
expressive
of
their
astonishment
walking
up
to
bob
the
sheriff
inquired
where
the
boy
they
call
platt
thar
he
is
massa
answered
bob
pointing
to
me
and
twitching
off
his
hat
i
wondered
to
myself
what
business
he
could
possibly
have
with
me
and
turning
round
gazed
at
him
until
he
had
approached
within
a
step
during
my
long
residence
on
the
bayou
i
had
become
familiar
with
the
face
of
every
planter
within
many
miles
but
this
man
was
an
utter
stranger
certainly
i
had
never
seen
him
before
your
name
is
platt
is
it
he
asked
yes
master
i
responded
pointing
towards
northup
standing
a
few
rods
distant
he
demanded
do
you
know
that
man
i
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
and
as
my
eyes
rested
on
his
countenance
a
world
of
images
thronged
my
brain
a
multitude
of
faces
anne
and
the
dear
children
and
my
old
dead
father
all
the
scenes
and
associations
of
childhood
and
youth
all
the
friends
of
other
and
happier
days
appeared
and
disappeared
flitting
and
floating
like
dissolving
shadows
before
the
vision
of
my
imagination
until
at
last
the
perfect
memory
of
the
man
recurred
to
me
and
throwing
up
my
hands
towards
heaven
i
exclaimed
in
a
voice
louder
than
i
could
utter
in
a
less
exciting
moment
northup
thank
god
thank
god
in
an
instant
i
comprehended
the
nature
of
his
business
and
felt
that
the
hour
of
my
deliverance
was
at
hand
i
started
towards
him
but
the
sheriff
stepped
before
me
stop
a
moment
said
he
have
you
any
other
name
than
platt
solomon
northup
is
my
name
master
i
replied
have
you
a
family
he
inquired
i
a
wife
and
three
children
what
were
your
children
names
elizabeth
margaret
and
alonzo
and
your
wife
name
before
her
marriage
anne
hampton
who
married
you
timothy
eddy
of
fort
edward
where
does
that
gentleman
live
again
pointing
to
northup
who
remained
standing
in
the
same
place
where
i
had
first
recognized
him
he
lives
in
sandy
hill
washington
county
was
the
reply
he
was
proceeding
to
ask
further
questions
but
i
pushed
past
him
unable
longer
to
restrain
myself
i
seized
my
old
acquaintance
by
both
hands
i
could
not
speak
i
could
not
refrain
from
tears
sol
he
said
at
length
i
glad
to
see
you
i
essayed
to
make
some
answer
but
emotion
choked
all
utterance
and
i
was
silent
the
slaves
utterly
confounded
stood
gazing
upon
the
scene
their
open
mouths
and
rolling
eyes
indicating
the
utmost
wonder
and
astonishment
for
ten
years
i
had
dwelt
among
them
in
the
field
and
in
the
cabin
borne
the
same
hardships
partaken
the
same
fare
mingled
my
griefs
with
theirs
participated
in
the
same
scanty
joys
nevertheless
not
until
this
hour
the
last
i
was
to
remain
among
them
had
the
remotest
suspicion
of
my
true
name
or
the
slightest
knowledge
of
my
real
history
been
entertained
by
any
one
of
them
not
a
word
was
spoken
for
several
minutes
during
which
time
i
clung
fast
to
northup
looking
up
into
his
face
fearful
i
should
awake
and
find
it
all
a
dream
throw
down
that
sack
northup
added
finally
your
days
are
over
come
with
us
to
the
man
you
live
with
i
obeyed
him
and
walking
between
him
and
the
sheriff
we
moved
towards
the
great
house
it
was
not
until
we
had
proceeded
some
distance
that
i
had
recovered
my
voice
sufficiently
to
ask
if
my
family
were
all
living
he
informed
me
he
had
seen
anne
margaret
and
elizabeth
but
a
short
time
previously
that
alonzo
was
also
living
and
all
were
well
my
mother
however
i
could
never
see
again
as
i
began
to
recover
in
some
measure
from
the
sudden
and
great
excitement
which
so
overwhelmed
me
i
grew
faint
and
weak
insomuch
it
was
with
difficulty
i
could
walk
the
sheriff
took
hold
of
my
arm
and
assisted
me
or
i
think
i
should
have
fallen
as
we
entered
the
yard
epps
stood
by
the
gate
conversing
with
the
driver
that
young
man
faithful
to
his
instructions
was
entirely
unable
to
give
him
the
least
information
in
answer
to
his
repeated
inquiries
of
what
was
going
on
by
the
time
we
reached
him
he
was
almost
as
much
amazed
and
puzzled
as
bob
or
uncle
abram
shaking
hands
with
the
sheriff
and
receiving
an
introduction
to
northup
he
invited
them
into
the
house
ordering
me
at
the
same
time
to
bring
in
some
wood
it
was
some
time
before
i
succeeded
in
cutting
an
armful
having
somehow
unaccountably
lost
the
power
of
wielding
the
axe
with
any
manner
of
precision
when
i
entered
with
it
at
last
the
table
was
strewn
with
papers
from
one
of
which
northup
was
reading
i
was
probably
longer
than
necessity
required
in
placing
the
sticks
upon
the
fire
being
particular
as
to
the
exact
position
of
each
individual
one
of
them
i
heard
the
words
the
said
solomon
northup
and
the
deponent
further
says
and
free
citizen
of
repeated
frequently
and
from
these
expressions
understood
that
the
secret
i
had
so
long
retained
from
master
and
mistress
epps
was
finally
developing
i
lingered
as
long
as
prudence
permitted
and
was
about
leaving
the
room
when
epps
inquired
illustration
scene
in
the
cotton
field
solomon
delivered
up
platt
do
you
know
this
gentleman
yes
master
i
replied
i
have
known
him
as
long
as
i
can
remember
where
does
he
live
he
lives
in
did
you
ever
live
there
yes
master
born
and
bred
there
you
was
free
then
now
you
d
d
nigger
he
exclaimed
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
when
i
bought
you
master
epps
i
answered
in
a
somewhat
different
tone
than
the
one
in
which
i
had
been
accustomed
to
address
him
master
epps
you
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
ask
me
besides
i
told
one
of
my
owners
the
man
that
kidnapped
me
that
i
was
free
and
was
whipped
almost
to
death
for
it
it
seems
there
has
been
a
letter
written
for
you
by
somebody
now
who
is
it
he
demanded
authoritatively
i
made
no
reply
i
say
who
wrote
that
letter
he
demanded
again
perhaps
i
wrote
it
myself
i
said
you
have
been
to
marksville
and
back
before
light
i
know
he
insisted
upon
my
informing
him
and
i
insisted
i
would
not
he
made
many
vehement
threats
against
the
man
whoever
he
might
be
and
intimated
the
bloody
and
savage
vengeance
he
would
wreak
upon
him
when
he
found
him
out
his
whole
manner
and
language
exhibited
a
feeling
of
anger
towards
the
unknown
person
who
had
written
for
me
and
of
fretfulness
at
the
idea
of
losing
so
much
property
addressing
northup
he
swore
if
he
had
only
had
an
hour
notice
of
his
coming
he
would
have
saved
him
the
trouble
of
taking
me
back
to
that
he
would
have
run
me
into
the
swamp
or
some
other
place
out
of
the
way
where
all
the
sheriffs
on
earth
could
have
found
me
i
walked
out
into
the
yard
and
was
entering
the
kitchen
door
when
something
struck
me
in
the
back
aunt
phebe
emerging
from
the
back
door
of
the
great
house
with
a
pan
of
potatoes
had
thrown
one
of
them
with
unnecessary
violence
thereby
giving
me
to
understand
that
she
wished
to
speak
to
me
a
moment
confidentially
running
up
to
me
she
whispered
in
my
ear
with
great
earnestness
lor
a
mity
platt
what
d
think
dem
two
men
come
after
ye
heard
tell
massa

wife
and
tree
children
back
thar
whar
you
come
from
goin
wid
fool
if
ye
do
wish
i
could
go
and
aunt
phebe
ran
on
in
this
manner
at
a
rapid
rate
presently
mistress
epps
made
her
appearance
in
the
kitchen
she
said
many
things
to
me
and
wondered
why
i
had
not
told
her
who
i
was
she
expressed
her
regret
complimenting
me
by
saying
she
had
rather
lose
any
other
servant
on
the
plantation
had
patsey
that
day
stood
in
my
place
the
measure
of
my
mistress
joy
would
have
overflowed
now
there
was
no
one
left
who
could
mend
a
chair
or
a
piece
of
furniture
no
one
who
was
of
any
use
about
the
house
no
one
who
could
play
for
her
on
the
violin
and
mistress
epps
was
actually
affected
to
tears
epps
had
called
to
bob
to
bring
up
his
saddle
horse
the
other
slaves
also
overcoming
their
fear
of
the
penalty
had
left
their
work
and
come
to
the
yard
they
were
standing
behind
the
cabins
out
of
sight
of
epps
they
beckoned
me
to
come
to
them
and
with
all
the
eagerness
of
curiosity
excited
to
the
highest
pitch
conversed
with
and
questioned
me
if
i
could
repeat
the
exact
words
they
uttered
with
the
same
emphasis
if
i
could
paint
their
several
attitudes
and
the
expression
of
their
countenances
it
would
be
indeed
an
interesting
picture
in
their
estimation
i
had
suddenly
arisen
to
an
immeasurable
height
had
become
a
being
of
immense
importance
the
legal
papers
having
been
served
and
arrangements
made
with
epps
to
meet
them
the
next
day
at
marksville
northup
and
the
sheriff
entered
the
carriage
to
return
to
the
latter
place
as
i
was
about
mounting
to
the
driver
seat
the
sheriff
said
i
ought
to
bid
and
epps
good
bye
i
ran
back
to
the
piazza
where
they
were
standing
and
taking
off
my
hat
said
missis

a
white
man
that

would
have
been
an
inward
comfort
had
i
dared
to
have
given
him
a
parting
kick
on
my
way
back
to
the
carriage
patsey
ran
from
behind
a
cabin

half
reclining
on
the
ground
epps

on
the
piazza

abram
and
bob
and
wiley
and
aunt

stood
by
the
gate
gazing
after
me
i
waved
my
hand
but
the
carriage
turned
a
bend
of
the
bayou
hiding
them
from
my
eyes
forever
we
stopped
a
moment
at
carey
sugar
house
where
a
great
number
of
slaves
were
at
work
such
an
establishment

the

presented
his

the

described
the
scene
in
the
cotton

i
was
also
interrogated
at
great
length
finally
taylor
assured
his
client
that
he
was
satisfied
and
that
litigation
would
not

be
expensive
but
utterly
useless
in

with
his
advice
a

drawn
up

perhaps
i
did

to
the

who
had

many

for

perhaps
i

we

theophilus
in

but
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
renew
acquaintance
with
him
from
respectable
citizens
we
ascertained
he
had
become
a
low
miserable
rowdy
a
disreputable
man
we
also
visited
the
recorder
genois
to
whom
senator
letter
was
directed
and
found
him
a
man
well
deserving
the
wide
and
honorable
reputation
that
he
bears
he
very
generously
furnished
us
with
a
sort
of
legal
pass
over
his
signature
and
seal
of
office
and
as
it
contains
the

it
may

it

the

to

this
is
to

that
henry
northup
esquire
of
the
county

has
produced
before
me

of
the

of

about
years
five

th
genois
recorder
on
the
we
came
to
lake
pontchartrain
by
railroad
and
in
due
time
following
the
usual
route
reached
charleston
after
going
on
board
the
steamboat
and
paying
our
passage
at
this
city
northup
was
called
upon
by
a
officer
to
explain
why
he
had
not
registered
his
servant
he
replied
that
he
had
no
servant
that
as
the
agent
of
he
was
accompanying
a
free
citizen
of
that
state
from
slavery
to
freedom
and
did
not
desire
nor
intend
to
make
any
registry
whatever
i
conceived
from
his
conversation
and
manner
though
i
may
perhaps
be
entirely
mistaken
that
no
great
pains
would
be
taken
to
avoid
whatever
difficulty
the
charleston
officials
might
deem
proper
to
create
at
length
however
we
were
permitted
to
proceed
and
passing
through
richmond
where
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
goodin
pen
arrived
in
washington
january
we
ascertained
that
both
burch
and
radburn
were
still
residing
in
that
city
immediately
a
complaint
was
entered
with
a
police
magistrate
of
washington
against
james
burch
for
kidnapping
and
selling
me
into
slavery
he
was
arrested
upon
a
warrant
issued
by
justice
goddard
and
returned
before
justice
mansel
and
held
to
bail
in
the
sum
of
three
thousand
dollars
when
first
arrested
burch
was
much
excited
exhibiting
the
utmost
fear
and
alarm
and
before
reaching
the
justice
office
on
louisiana
avenue
and
before
knowing
the
precise
nature
of
the
complaint
begged
the
police
to
permit
him
to
consult
benjamin
shekels
a
slave
trader
of
seventeen
years
standing
and
his
former
partner
the
latter
became
his
bail
at
ten
the
of
january
both
parties
appeared
before
the
magistrate
senator
chase
of
ohio
hon
orville
clark
of
sandy
hill
and
northup
acted
as
counsel
for
the
prosecution
and
joseph
bradley
for
the
defence
orville
clark
was
called
and
sworn
as
a
witness
and
testified
that
he
had
known
me
from
childhood
and
that
i
was
a
free
man
as
was
my
father
before
me
northup
then
testified
to
the
same
and
proved
the
facts
connected
with
his
mission
to
avoyelles
ebenezer
radburn
was
then
sworn
for
the
prosecution
and
testified
he
was
years
old
that
he
was
a
resident
of
washington
and
had
known
burch
fourteen
years
that
in
he
was
keeper
of
williams
slave
pen
that
he
remembered
the
fact
of
my
confinement
in
the
pen
that
year
at
this
point
it
was
admitted
by
the
counsel
that
i
had
been
placed
in
the
pen
by
burch
in
the
spring
of
and
hereupon
the
prosecution
rested
benjamin
shekels
was
then
offered
as
a
witness
by
the
prisoner
benjamin
is
a
large
man
and
the
reader
may
perhaps
get
a
somewhat
correct
conception
of
him
by
reading
the
exact
language
he
used
in
answer
to
the
first
question
of
defendant
lawyer
he
was
asked
the
place
of
his
nativity
and
his
reply
uttered
in
a
sort
of
rowdyish
way
was
in
these
very
words
i
was
born
in
ontario
county
and
fourteen
benjamin
was
a
prodigious
baby
he
further
testified
that
he
kept
the
steamboat
hotel
in
washington
in
and
saw
me
there
in
the
spring
of
that
year
he
was
proceeding
to
state
what
he
had
heard
two
men
say
when
senator
chase
raised
a
legal
objection
to
wit
that
the
sayings
of
third
persons
being
hearsay
was
improper
evidence
the
objection
was
overruled
by
the
justice
and
shekels
continued
stating
that
two
men
came
to
his
hotel
and
represented
they
had
a
colored
man
for
sale
that
they
had
an
interview
with
burch
that
they
stated
they
came
from
georgia
but
he
did
not
remember
the
county
that
they
gave
a
full
history
of
the
boy
saying
he
was
a
bricklayer
and
played
on
the
violin
that
burch
remarked
he
would
purchase
if
they
could
agree
that
they
went
out
and
brought
the
boy
in
and
that
i
was
the
same
person
he
further
testified
with
as
much
unconcern
as
if
it
was
the
truth
that
i
represented
i
was
born
and
bred
in
georgia
that
one
of
the
young
men
with
me
was
my
master
that
i
exhibited
a
great
deal
of
regret
at
parting
with
him
and
he
believed
got
into
tears
nevertheless
that
i
insisted
my
master
had
a
right
to
sell
me
that
he
to
sell
me
and
the
remarkable
reason
i
gave
was
according
to
shekels
because
he
my
master
had
been
gambling
and
on
a
spree
he
continued
in
these
words
copied
from
the
minutes
taken
on
the
examination
burch
interrogated
the
boy
in
the
usual
manner
told
him
if
he
purchased
him
he
should
send
him
south
the
boy
said
he
had
no
objection
that
in
fact
he
would
like
to
go
south
burch
paid
for
him
to
my
knowledge
i
do
know
what
name
was
given
him
but
think
it
was
not
solomon
did
not
know
the
name
of
either
of
the
two
men
they
were
in
my
tavern
two
or
three
hours
during
which
time
the
boy
played
on
the
violin
the
bill
of
sale
was
signed
in
my
it
was
a
blank
filled
up
by
before
burch
was
my
partner
our
business
was
buying
and
selling
slaves
after
that
time
he
was
a
partner
of
theophilus
freeman
of
burch
bought
here
freeman
sold
there
shekels
before
testifying
had
heard
my
relation
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
visit
to
washington
with
brown
and
hamilton
and
therefore
it
was
undoubtedly
he
spoke
of
two
men
and
of
my
playing
on
the
violin
such
was
his
fabrication
utterly
untrue
and
yet
there
was
found
in
washington
a
man
who
endeavored
to
corroborate
him
benjamin
thorn
testified
he
was
at
shekels
in
and
saw
a
colored
boy
playing
on
a
fiddle
shekels
said
he
was
for
sale
heard
his
master
tell
him
he
should
sell
him
the
boy
acknowledged
to
me
he
was
a
slave
i
was
not
present
when
the
money
was
paid
will
not
swear
positively
this
is
the
boy
the
master
near
shedding
tears
i
think
the
boy
i
have
been
engaged
in
the
business
of
taking
slaves
south
off
and
on
for
twenty
years
when
i
ca
do
that
i
do
something
else
i
was
then
offered
as
a
witness
but
objection
being
made
the
court
decided
my
evidence
inadmissible
it
was
rejected
solely
on
the
ground
that
i
was
a
colored
man
the
fact
of
my
being
a
free
citizen
of
not
being
disputed
shekels
having
testified
there
was
a
bill
of
sale
executed
burch
was
called
upon
by
the
prosecution
to
produce
it
inasmuch
as
such
a
paper
would
corroborate
the
testimony
of
thorn
and
shekels
the
prisoner
counsel
saw
the
necessity
of
exhibiting
it
or
giving
some
reasonable
explanation
for
its
to
effect
the
latter
burch
himself
was
offered
as
a
witness
in
his
own
behalf
it
was
contended
by
counsel
for
the
people
that
such
testimony
should
not
be
allowed
that
it
was
in
contravention
of
every
rule
of
evidence
and
if
permitted
would
defeat
the
ends
of
justice
his
testimony
however
was
received
by
the
court
he
made
oath
that
such
a
bill
of
sale
had
been
drawn
up
and
signed
he
had
lost
it
and
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
thereupon
the
magistrate
was
requested
to
dispatch
a
police
officer
to
burch
residence
with
directions
to
bring
his
books
containing
his
bills
of
sales
for
the
year
the
request
was
granted
and
before
any
measure
could
be
taken
to
prevent
it
the
officer
had
obtained
possession
of
the
books
and
brought
them
into
court
the
sales
for
the
year
were
found
and
carefully
examined
but
no
sale
of
myself
by
any
name
was
discovered
upon
this
testimony
the
court
held
the
fact
to
be
established
that
burch
came
innocently
and
honestly
by
me
and
accordingly
he
was
discharged
an
attempt
was
then
made
by
burch
and
his
satellites
to
fasten
upon
me
the
charge
that
i
had
conspired
with
the
two
white
men
to
defraud
him
with
what
success
appears
in
an
extract
taken
from
an
article
in
the
times
published
a
day
or
two
subsequent
to
the
trial
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
had
drawn
up
before
the
defendant
was
discharged
an
affidavit
signed
by
burch
and
had
a
warrant
out
against
the
colored
man
for
a
conspiracy
with
the
two
white
men
before
referred
to
to
defraud
burch
out
of
six
hundred
and
dollars
the
warrant
was
served
and
the
colored
man
arrested
and
brought
before
officer
goddard
burch
and
his
witnesses
appeared
in
court
and
northup
appeared
as
counsel
for
the
colored
man
stating
he
was
ready
to
proceed
as
counsel
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
and
asking
no
delay
whatever
burch
after
consulting
privately
a
short
time
with
shekels
stated
to
the
magistrate
that
he
wished
him
to
dismiss
the
complaint
as
he
would
not
proceed
farther
with
it
defendant
counsel
stated
to
the
magistrate
that
if
the
complaint
was
withdrawn
it
must
be
without
the
request
or
consent
of
the
defendant
burch
then
asked
the
magistrate
to
let
him
have
the
complaint
and
the
warrant
and
he
took
them
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
objected
to
his
receiving
them
and
insisted
they
should
remain
as
part
of
the
records
of
the
court
and
that
the
court
should
endorse
the
proceedings
which
had
been
had
under
the
process
burch
delivered
them
up
and
the
court
rendered
a
judgment
of
discontinuance
by
the
request
of
the
prosecutor
and
filed
it
in
his
office
there
may
be
those
who
will
affect
to
believe
the
statement
of
the
those
in
whose
minds
his
allegations
will
weigh
heavier
than
mine
i
am
a
poor
colored
man
one
of
a
and
degraded
race
whose
humble
voice
may
not
be
heeded
by
the
oppressor
but
the
truth
and
with
a
full
sense
of
my
accountability
i
do
solemnly
declare
before
men
and
before
god
that
any
charge
or
assertion
that
i
conspired
directly
or
indirectly
with
any
person
or
persons
to
sell
myself
that
any
other
account
of
my
visit
to
washington
my
capture
and
imprisonment
in
williams
slave
pen
than
is
contained
in
these
pages
is
utterly
and
absolutely
false
i
never
played
on
the
violin
in
washington
i
never
was
in
the
steamboat
hotel
and
never
saw
thorn
or
shekels
to
my
knowledge
in
my
life
until
last
january
the
story
of
the
trio
of
is
a
fabrication
as
absurd
as
it
is
base
and
unfounded
were
it
true
i
should
not
have
turned
aside
on
my
way
back
to
liberty
for
the
purpose
of
prosecuting
burch
i
should
have
rather
than
sought
him
i
should
have
known
that
such
a
step
would
have
resulted
in
rendering
me
infamous
under
the
circumstances
longing
as
i
did
to
behold
my
family
and
elated
with
the
prospect
of
returning
home
it
is
an
outrage
upon
probability
to
suppose
i
would
have
run
the
hazard
not
only
of
exposure
but
of
a
criminal
prosecution
and
conviction
by
voluntarily
placing
myself
in
the
position
i
did
if
the
statements
of
burch
and
his
confederates
contain
a
particle
of
truth
i
took
pains
to
seek
him
out
to
confront
him
in
a
court
of
law
charging
him
with
the
crime
of
kidnapping
and
the
only
motive
that
impelled
me
to
this
step
was
a
burning
sense
of
the
wrong
he
had
inflicted
upon
me
and
a
desire
to
bring
him
to
justice
he
was
acquitted
in
the
manner
and
by
such
means
as
have
been
described
a
human
tribunal
has
permitted
him
to
escape
but
there
is
another
and
a
higher
tribunal
where
false
testimony
will
not
prevail
and
where
i
am
willing
so
far
at
least
as
these
statements
are
concerned
to
be
judged
at
last
we
left
washington
on
the
of
january
and
proceeding
by
the
way
of
philadelphia
and
albany
reached
sandy
hill
in
the
night
of
the
my
heart
overflowed
with
happiness
as
i
looked
around
upon
old
familiar
scenes
and
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
friends
of
other
days
the
following
morning
i
started
in
company
with
several
acquaintances
for
glens
falls
the
residence
of
anne
and
our
children
as
i
entered
their
comfortable
cottage
margaret
was
the
first
that
met
me
she
did
not
recognize
me
when
i
left
her
she
was
but
seven
years
old
a
little
prattling
girl
playing
with
her
toys
now
she
was
grown
to
womanhood
was
married
with
a
boy
standing
by
her
side
not
forgetful
of
his
enslaved
unfortunate
she
had
named

when
told
who
i
was
she
was
overcome
with
emotion
and
unable
to
speak
presently
elizabeth
entered
the
room
and
anne
came
running
from
the
hotel
having
been
informed
of
my
arrival
they
embraced
me
and
with
tears
flowing
down
their
cheeks
hung
upon
my
neck
but
i
draw
a
veil
over
a
scene
which
can
better
be
imagined
than
described
when
the
violence
of
our
emotions
had
subsided
to
a
sacred
joy
when
the
household
gathered
round
the
fire
that
sent
out
its
warm
and
crackling
comfort
through
the
room
we
conversed
of
the
thousand
events
that
had
occurred
the
hopes
and
fears
the
joys
and
sorrows
the
trials
and
troubles
we
had
each
experienced
during
the
long
separation
alonzo
was
absent
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
the
boy
had
written
to
his
mother
a
short
time
previous
of
the
prospect
of
his
obtaining
sufficient
money
to
purchase
my
freedom
from
his
earliest
years
that
had
been
the
chief
object
of
his
thoughts
and
his
ambition
they
knew
i
was
in
bondage
the
letter
written
on
board
the
brig
and
clem
ray
himself
had
given
them
that
information
but
where
i
was
until
the
arrival
of
bass

was
a
matter
of
conjecture
elizabeth
and
margaret
once
returned
from
school
so
anne
informed
me
weeping
bitterly
on
inquiring
the
cause
of
the
children
sorrow
it
was
found
that
while
studying
geography
their
attention
had
been
attracted
to
the
picture
of
slaves
working
in
the
and
an
overseer
following
them
with
his
whip
it
reminded
them
of
the
sufferings
their
father
might
be
and
as
it
happened
actually
enduring
in
the
south
numerous
incidents
such
as
these
were
related
incidents
showing
they
still
held
me
in
constant
remembrance

not
perhaps
of
sufficient
interest
to
the
reader
to
be
recounted

about

of
age
and
never
resided
out
