pagan

by

the
romance
of
the
road
among
the
many
places
of
magic
visited
by
pantagruel
and
his
company
during
the
progress
of
their
famous
voyage
few
surpass
that
island
whose
roads
did
literally
go
to
places
ou
les
chemins
cheminent
comme
animaulx
and
travellers
having
inquired
of
the
road
as
to
its
destination
and
received
satisfactory
reply

the
best
example
i
know
of
an
approach
to
this
excellent
sort
of
vitality
in
roads
is
the
ridgeway
of
the
north
berkshire
downs
join
it
at
streatley
the
point
where
it
crosses
the
thames
at
once
it
strikes
you
out
and
away
from
the
habitable
world
in
a
splendid
purposeful
manner
running
along
the
highest
ridge
of
the
downs
a
broad
green
ribbon
of
turf
with
but
a
shade
of
difference
from
the
neighbouring
grass
yet
distinct
for
all
that
no
villages
nor
homesteads
tempt
it
aside
or
modify
its
course
for
a
yard
should
you
lose
the
track
where
it
is
blent
with
the
bordering
turf
or
merged
in
and
obliterated
by
paths
you
have
only
to
walk
straight
on
taking
heed
of
no
alternative
to
right
or
left
and
in
a
minute
with
you
again
arisen
out
of
the
earth
as
it
were
or
if
still
not
quite
assured
lift
you
your
eyes
and
there
it
runs
over
the
brow
of
the
fronting
hill
where
a
railway
crosses
it
it
disappears
indeed
hiding
from
the
ignominy
of
rubble
and
but
a
little
way
on
it
takes
up
the
running
again
with
the
same
quiet
persistence
out
on
that
almost
trackless
expanse
of
billowy
downs
such
a
track
is
in
some
sort
humanly
companionable
it
really
seems
to
lead
you
by
the
hand
the
rudge
is
of
course
an
exceptional
instance
but
indeed
this
pleasant
personality
in
roads
is
not
entirely
fanciful
it
exists
as
a
characteristic
of
the
old
country
road
evolved
out
of
the
primitive
prehistoric
track
developing
according
to
the
needs
of
the
land
it
passes
through
and
serves
with
a
language
accordingly
and
a
meaning
of
its
own
its
special
services
are
often
told
clearly
enough
but
much
else
too
of
the
quiet
story
of
the
something
of
the
old
tale
whereof
you
learn
so
little
from
the
printed
page
each
is
instinct
perhaps
with
a
separate
suggestion
some
are
martial
and
historic
and
by
your
side
the
hurrying
feet
of
the
dead
raise
a
ghostly
dust
the
name
of
yon
town
with
its
roman
or
saxon
suffix
to
british
root
hints
at
much
many
a
strong
man
wanting
his
vates
sacer
passed
silently
to
hades
for
that
suffix
to
obtain
the
little
rise
up
yonder
on
the
downs
that
breaks
their
straight
green
line
against
the
sky
showed
another
sight
when
the
sea
of
battle
surged
and
beat
on
its
trampled
sides
and
the
roman
sore
beset
may
have
gazed
down
this
very
road
for
relief
praying
for
night
or
the
succouring
legion
this
child
that
swings
on
a
gate
and
peeps
at
you
from
under
her
so
may
some
of
hers
have
watched
with
beating
heart
the
wessex
levies
hurry
along
to
clash
with
the
heathen
and
break
them
on
the
down
where
the
ash
trees
grew
and
yonder
where
the
road
swings
round
under
gloomy
overgrowth
of
drooping
boughs
is
that
gleam
of
water
or
glitter
of
lurking
spears
some
sing
you
pastorals
fluting
low
in
the
hot
sun
between
dusty
hedges
overlooked
by
contented
cows
past
farmsteads
where
man
and
beast
living
in
frank
fellowship
learn
pleasant
and
serviceable
lessons
each
of
the
other
over
the
river
lipping
the
and
thence
on
either
side
through
leagues
of
hay
or
through
bending
corn
they
chant
the
mystical
wonderful
song
of
the
reaper
when
the
harvest
is
white
to
the
sickle
but
most
of
them
avoiding
classification
keep
each
his
several
tender
significance
as
with
one
i
know
not
so
far
from
town
which
woos
you
from
the
valley
by
gentle
ascent
between
hedges
and
ever
by
some
touch
of
keen
fragrance
in
the
air
by
some
mystery
of
added
softness
under
foot
ever
a
promise
of
something
to
come
unguessed
delighting
till
suddenly
you
are
among
the
pines
their
keen
scent
strikes
you
through
and
through
their
needles
carpet
the
ground
and
in
their
swaying
tops
moans
the
unappeasable
wind
sad
ceaseless
as
the
cry
of
a
warped
humanity
some
paces
more
and
the
promise
is
fulfilled
the
hints
and
whisperings
become
fruition
the
ground
breaks
steeply
away
and
you
look
over
a
great
inland
sea
of
fields
homesteads
rolling
woodland
and
bounding
all
blent
with
the
horizon
a
greyness
a
gleam
the
english
channel
a
road
of
promises
of
hinted
surprises
following
each
other
with
the
inevitable
sequence
in
a
melody
but
we
are
now
in
another
and
stricter
sense
an
island
of
chemins
qui
cheminent
dominated
indeed
by
them
by
these
the
traveller
veritably
se
guindans
may
reach
his
destination
sans
se
poiner
ou
se
fatiguer
with
large
qualifications
but
sans
very
much
else
whereof
he
were
none
the
worse
the
gain
seems
so
obvious
that
you
forget
to
miss
all
that
lay
between
the
springing
stride
of
the
early
start
and
the
pleasant
weariness
of
the
end
approached
when
the
limbs
lag
a
little
as
the
lights
of
your
destination
begin
to
glimmer
through
the
dusk
all
that
lay
between
a
day
ride
a
romance
was
the
excellent
title
of
an
unsuccessful
book
and
indeed
the
journey
should
march
with
the
day
beginning
and
ending
with
its
sun
to
be
the
complete
thing
the
golden
round
required
of
it
this
makes
that
mind
and
body
fare
together
hand
in
hand
sharing
the
hope
the
action
the
fruition
finding
equal
sweetness
in
the
languor
of
aching
limbs
at
eve
and
in
the
first
intoxication
of
motion
with
braced
muscle
in
the
sun
for
walk
or
ride
take
the
mind
over
greater
distances
than
a
throbbing
whirl
with
stiffening
joints
and
cramped
limbs
through
a
dozen
counties
surely
you
seem
to
cover
vaster
spaces
with
lavengro
footing
it
with
gipsies
or
driving
his
tinker
cart
across
lonely
commons
than
with
many
a
or
with
diary
or
log
and
even
that
dividing
line
strictly
marked
and
rarely
overstepped
between
the
man
who
bicycles
and
the
man
who
walks
is
less
due
to
a
prudent
regard
for
personal
safety
of
the
one
part
than
to
an
essential
difference
in
minds
there
is
a
certain
supernal
a
deific
state
of
mind
which
may
indeed
be
experienced
in
a
minor
degree
by
any
one
in
the
siesta
part
of
a
turkish
bath
but
this
particular
golden
glow
of
the
faculties
is
only
felt
at
its
fulness
after
severe
and
prolonged
exertion
in
the
open
air
a
man
ought
to
be
seen
by
the
gods
says
marcus
aurelius
neither
dissatisfied
with
anything
nor
complaining
though
this
does
not
sound
at
first
hearing
an
excessive
demand
to
make
of
humanity
yet
the
gods
i
fancy
look
long
and
often
for
such
a
sight
in
these
unblest
days
of
hurry
if
ever
seen
at
all
is
when
after
many
a
mile
in
sun
and
wind
maybe
rain
you
reach
at
last
with
the
folding
star
your
destined
rustic
inn
there
in
its
homely
comfortable
strangeness
after
unnumbered
chops
with
country
ale
the
hard
facts
of
life
begin
to
swim
in
a
golden
mist
you
are
isled
from
accustomed
cares
and
worries
you
are
set
in
a
peculiar
nook
of
rest
then
old
failures
seem
partial
successes
then
old
loves
come
back
in
their
fairest
form
but
this
time
with
never
a
shadow
of
regret
then
old
jokes
renew
their
youth
and
flavour
you
ask
nothing
of
the
gods
above
nothing
of
men
below
not
even
their
company
you
shall
begin
life
again
shall
write
your
book
make
your
fortune
do
anything
meanwhile
you
sit
and
the
jolly
world
swings
round
and
you
seem
to
hear
it
circle
to
the
music
of
the
spheres
what
pipe
was
ever
thus
beatifying
in
effect
you
are
aching
all
over
and
enjoying
it
and
the
scent
of
the
limes
drifts
in
through
the
window
this
is
undoubtedly
the
best
and
greatest
country
in
the
world
and
none
but
good
fellows
abide
in
it
laud
we
the
gods
and
let
our
crooked
smokes
climb
to
their
nostrils
from
our
blest
altars
the
romance
of
the
rail
in
these
iron
days
of
the
dominance
of
steam
the
crowning
wrong
that
is
wrought
us
of
furnace
and
lies
in
their
annihilation
of
the
steadfast
mystery
of
the
horizon
so
that
the
imagination
no
longer
begins
to
work
at
the
point
where
vision
ceases
in
happier
times
three
hundred
years
ago
the
seafarers
from
bristol
city
looked
out
from
the
prows
of
their
vessels
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
and
wot
not
rightly
whether
the
land
they
saw
might
be
jerusalem
or
madagascar
or
if
it
were
not
north
and
south
america
and
there
be
certaine
flitting
islands
says
one
which
have
been
oftentimes
seene
and
when
men
approached
near
them
they
vanished
it
may
be
that
the
gulfs
will
wash
us
down
said
ulysses
thinking
of
what
americans
call
the
place
it
may
be
we
shall
touch
the
happy
isles
and
so
on
and
so
on
each
with
his
special
hope
or
wild
surmise
there
was
always
a
chance
of
touching
the
happy
isles
and
in
that
first
fair
world
whose
men
and
manners
we
knew
through
before
experience
taught
us
far
other
the
prince
mounts
his
horse
one
fine
morning
and
rides
all
day
and
sleeps
in
a
forest
and
next
morning
lo
a
new
country
and
he
rides
by
fields
and
granges
never
visited
before
through
faces
strange
to
him
to
where
an
unknown
king
steps
down
to
welcome
the
mysterious
stranger
and
he
marries
the
princess
and
dwells
content
for
many
a
year
till
one
day
he
thinks
i
will
look
upon
my
father
face
again
though
the
leagues
be
long
to
my
own
land
and
he
rides
all
day
and
sleeps
in
a
forest
and
next
morning
he
is
made
welcome
at
home
where
his
name
has
become
a
dim
memory
which
is
all
as
it
should
be
for
annihilate
time
and
space
as
you
may
a
man
stride
remains
the
true
standard
of
distance
an
eternal
and
unalterable
scale
the
severe
horizon
too
repels
the
thoughts
as
you
gaze
to
the
infinite
considerations
that
lie
about
within
touch
and
hail
and
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
can
work
to
all
these
natural
bounds
and
limitations
it
is
good
to
get
back
now
and
again
from
a
life
assisted
and
smooth
by
artificialities
where
iron
has
superseded
muscle
the
kindly
is
apt
to
throb
dull
as
the
measured
beat
of
the
but
the
getting
back
to
them
is
now
a
matter
of
effort
of
set
purpose
a
stepping
aside
out
of
our
ordinary
course
they
are
no
longer
unsought
influences
towards
the
making
of
character
so
perhaps
the
time
of
them
has
gone
by
here
in
this
second
generation
of
steam
pereunt
et
imputantur
they
pass
away
and
are
scored
against
not
us
but
our
guilty
fathers
for
ourselves
our
peculiar
slate
is
probably
filling
fast
the
romance
of
the
is
yet
to
be
captured
and
expressed
not
fully
nor
worthily
perhaps
until
it
too
is
a
vanished
regret
though
emerson
for
one
will
not
have
it
so
and
maintains
and
justifies
its
right
to
immediate
recognition
as
poetic
material
for
as
it
is
dislocation
and
detachment
from
the
life
of
god
that
makes
things
ugly
the
poet
who
things
to
nature
and
the
whole
even
artificial
things
and
violations
of
nature
to
nature
by
a
deeper
insight
disposes
very
easily
of
the
most
disagreeable
facts
so
that
he
looks
upon
the
factory
village
and
the
railway
and
sees
them
fall
within
the
great
order
not
less
than
the
or
the
spider
geometrical
web
the
poet
however
seems
hard
to
convince
hereof
emerson
will
have
it
that
nature
loves
the
gliding
train
of
cars
instead
of
which
the
poet
still
goes
about
the
country
singing
purling
brooks
painters
have
been
more
flexible
and
liberal
turner
saw
and
did
his
best
to
seize
the
spirit
of
the
thing
its
kinship
with
the
elements
and
to
blend
and
rush
of
iron
with
the
the
wind
and
the
and
to
make
the
whole
a
single
expression
of
irresoluble
force
and
even
in
a
certain
work
by
another
and
a
very
different
painter
though
i
willingly
acquit
mr
frith
of
any
deliberate
romantic
intention
you
shall
find
the
element
of
romance
in
the
vestiges
of
the
old
order
still
lingering
in
the
first
transition
period
the
railway
carriages
with
luggage
piled
and
corded
on
top
the
guard
the
little
engine
tethered
well
ahead
as
if
between
traces
to
those
bred
within
sight
of
the
sea
steamers
will
always
partake
in
somewhat
of
the
beauty
and
mystery
of
the
ships
above
all
if
their
happy
childhood
have
lain
among
the
gleaming
lochs
and
sinuous
firths
of
the
western
highlands
where
twice
a
week
maybe
the
strange
visitant
crept
by
headland
and
bay
a
piece
of
the
busy
mysterious
outer
world
for
myself
i
probably
stand
alone
in
owning
to
a
sentimental
weakness
for
the
whistle
judiciously
remote
as
some
men
love
the
skirl
of
the
pipes
in
the
days
when
streets
were
less
wearily
familiar
than
now
or
ever
the
golden
cord
was
quite
loosed
that
led
back
to
relinquished
fields
and
wider
skies
i
have
lain
awake
on
stifling
summer
nights
thinking
of
luckier
friends
by
moor
and
stream
and
listening
for
the
whistles
from
certain
railway
stations
veritable
horns
of
faintly
blowing
then
a
ghostly
passenger
i
have
taken
my
seat
in
a
phantom
train
and
sped
up
up
through
the
map
rehearsing
the
journey
bit
by
bit
through
the
midlands
and
on
till
the
grey
glimmer
of
dawn
showed
stone
walls
in
place
of
hedges
and
masses
looming
up
on
either
side
till
the
bright
sun
shone
upon
brown
leaping
streams
and
purple
heather
and
the
clear
sharp
northern
air
streamed
in
through
the
windows
return
indeed
was
bitter
my
first
touch
of
the
earth
went
nigh
to
kill
but
it
was
only
to
hurry
northwards
again
on
the
wings
of
imagination
from
dust
and
heat
to
the
dear
mountain
air
we
are
only
the
children
who
might
have
been
murmured
lamb
dream
babes
to
him
and
for
the
sake
of
those
the
journeys
that
might
have
been
i
still
hail
with
a
certain
affection
the
call
of
the
engine
in
the
night
even
as
i
love
sometimes
to
turn
the
enchanted
pages
of
the
railway
a
b
c
and
pass
from
one
to
the
other
name
reminiscent
or
suggestive
of
joy
and
freedom
devonian
maybe
or
savouring
of
wessex
or
bearing
me
away
to
some
sequestered
reach
of
the
quiet
thames
non
libri
sed

it
will
never
be
clear
to
the
lay
mind
why
the
buys
books
that
it
is
not
to
read
them
is
certain
the
closest
inspection
always
fails
to
find
him
thus
engaged
he
will
talk
about
them
all
night
if
you
let
him
wave
his
hand
to
them
shake
his
fist
at
them
shed
tears
over
them
in
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
but
he
will
not
read
them
yet
it
would
be
rash
to
infer
that
he
buys
his
books
without
a
remote
intention
of
ever
reading
them
most
book
lovers
start
with
the
honest
resolution
that
some
day
they
will
shut
down
on
this
fatal
practice
then
they
purpose
to
themselves
to
enter
into
their
charmed
circle
and
close
the
gates
of
paradise
behind
them
then
will
they
read
out
of
nothing
but
first
editions
every
day
shall
be
a
debauch
in
large
paper
and
tall
copies
and
crushed
morocco
shall
be
familiar
to
their
touch
as
buckram
meanwhile
though
books
continue
to
flaunt
their
venal
charms
it
would
be
cowardice
to
shun
the
fray
in
fine
one
buys
and
continues
to
buy
and
the
promised
sabbath
never
comes
the
process
of
the
purchase
is
always
much
the
same
therein
resembling
the
familiar
but
inferior
passion
of
love
there
is
the
first
sight
of
the
object
accompanied
of
a
catching
of
the
breath
a
trembling
in
the
limbs
loss
of
appetite
ungovernable
desire
and
a
habit
of
melancholy
in
secret
places
but
once
possessed
once
toyed
with
amorously
for
an
hour
or
two
the
object
as
in
the
inferior
passion
aforesaid
takes
its
destined
place
on
the
shelf
where
it
stays
and
this
saith
the
scoffer
is
all
but
even
he
does
not
fail
to
remark
with
a
certain
awe
that
the
owner
goeth
thereafter
as
one
possessing
a
happy
secret
and
radiating
an
inner
glow
moreover
he
is
insufferably
conceited
and
his
conceit
waxeth
as
his
coat
now
condemned
to
a
fresh
term
of
servitude
groweth
shabbier
and
shabby
though
his
coat
may
be
yet
will
he
never
stoop
to
renew
its
pristine
youth
and
gloss
by
the
price
of
any
book
no
man
no
human
masculine
natural
man
ever
sells
a
book
men
have
been
known
in
moments
of
thoughtlessness
or
compelled
by
temporary
necessity
to
rob
to
equivocate
to
do
murder
to
commit
what
they
should
not
to
wince
and
relent
and
refrain
from
what
they
should
these
things
howbeit
regrettable
are
common
to
humanity
and
may
happen
to
any
of
us
but
amateur
bookselling
is
foul
and
unnatural
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
our
language
so
capable
of
particularity
contains
no
distinctive
name
for
the
crime
fortunately
it
is
hardly
known
to
exist
the
face
of
the
public
being
set
against
it
as
a
flint
and
the
trade
giving
such
wretched
prices
in
you
not
infrequently
condone
an
extravagance
by
the
reflection
that
this
particular
purchase
will
be
a
good
investment
sordidly
considered
that
you
are
not
squandering
income
but
sinking
capital
but
you
know
all
the
time
that
you
are
lying
once
possessed
books
develop
a
personality
they
take
on
a
touch
of
warm
human
life
that
links
them
in
a
manner
with
our
kith
and
kin
non
angli
sed
angeli
was
the
comment
of
a
missionary
old
style
on
the
small
human
duodecimos
exposed
for
sale
in
the
roman
and
many
a
buyer
when
some
little
chattel
passed
into
his
possession
must
have
felt
that
here
was
something
vendible
no
more
so
of
these
you
may
well
affirm
non
libri
sed
liberi
children
now
adopted
into
the
circle
they
shall
be
trafficked
in
never
again
there
is
one
exception
which
has
sadly
to
be
made
one
class
of
men
of
whom
i
would
fain
if
possible
have
avoided
mention
who
are
strangers
to
any
such
scruples
these
be
executors
a
word
to
be
strongly
accented
on
the
penultimate
for
indeed
they
are
the
common
headsmen
of
collections
and
most
of
all
do
whet
their
bloody
edge
for
harmless
books
hoary
famous
old
collections
budding
young
collections
fair
virgin
collections
of
a
single
author
all
go
down
before
the
executor
remorseless
axe
he
careth
not
and
he
spareth
not
the
iniquity
of
oblivion
blindly
scattereth
her
poppy
and
it
is
chiefly
by
the
hand
of
the
executor
that
she
doth
love
to
scatter
it
may
oblivion
be
his
portion
for
ever
of
a
truth
the
foes
of
the
are
not
few
one
of
the
most
insidious
because
he
cometh
at
first
in
friendly
helpful
guise
is
the
bookbinder
not
in
that
he
bindeth
books
for
the
fair
binding
is
the
final
crown
and
flower
of
painful
achievement
but
because
he
bindeth
not
because
the
weary
weeks
lapse
by
and
turn
to
months
and
the
months
to
years
and
still
the
binder
bindeth
not
and
the
heart
grows
sick
with
hope
deferred
each
morn
the
maiden
binds
her
hair
each
spring
the
honeysuckle
binds
the
each
autumn
the
harvester
binds
his
sheaves
each
winter
the
iron
frost
binds
lake
and
stream
and
still
the
bookbinder
he
bindeth
not
then
a
secret
voice
whispereth
arise
be
a
man
and
slay
him
take
him
grossly
full
of
bread
with
all
his
crimes
as
flush
as
may
at
gaming
swearing
or
about
some
act
that
hath
no
relish
of
salvation
in
it
but
when
the
deed
is
done
and
the
floor
strewn
with
fragments
of
binder
still
the
books
remain
unbound
you
have
made
all
that
horrid
mess
for
nothing
and
the
weary
path
has
to
be
trodden
over
again
as
a
general
rule
the
man
in
the
habit
of
murdering
bookbinders
though
he
performs
a
distinct
service
to
society
only
wastes
his
own
time
and
takes
no
personal
advantage
and
even
supposing
that
after
many
days
your
books
return
to
you
in
leathern
surcoats
bravely
tricked
with
gold
you
have
scarce
yet
weathered
the
cape
and
sailed
into
halcyon
seas
for
these
books
well
you
kept
them
many
weeks
before
binding
them
that
the
oleaginous
might
fully
dry
before
the
necessary
hammering
you
forbore
to
open
the
pages
that
the
autocratic
binder
might
refold
the
sheets
if
he
pleased
and
now
that
all
is
over
consummatum
est
still
you
can
not
properly
enjoy
the
harvest
of
a
quiet
mind
for
these
purple
emperors
are
not
to
be
read
in
bed
nor
during
meals
nor
on
the
grass
with
a
pipe
on
sundays
and
these
brief
periods
are
all
the
whirling
times
allow
you
for
solid
serious
reading
still
after
all
you
have
them
you
can
at
least
pulverise
your
friends
with
the
sight
and
what
have
they
to
show
against
them
probably
some
miserable
score
or
so
of
such
as
lead
you
scornfully
to
quote
the
hackneyed
couplet
concerning
the
poor
indian
whose
untutored
mind
clothes
him
before
but
leaves
him
bare
behind
let
us
thank
the
gods
that
such
things
are
that
to
some
of
us
they
give
not
poverty
nor
riches
but
a
few
good
books
in
whole
bindings
dowered
with
these
and
if
it
be
vouchsafed
a
cup
of
burgundy
that
is
sound
even
if
it
be
not
old
we
can
leave
to
others
the
foaming
grape
of
eastern
france
that
was
vintaged
in
and
with
it
the
whole
range
of
shilling
shockers
the
barmecidal
feast
of
the
purposeful
novelist
yea
even
the
countless
series
that
tell
of
eminent
women
and
successful
men
loafing
when
the
golden
summer
has
rounded
languidly
to
his
close
when
autumn
has
been
carried
forth
in
russet
then
all
good
fellows
who
look
upon
holidays
as
a
chief
end
of
life
return
from
moor
and
stream
and
begin
to
take
stock
of
gains
and
losses
and
the
wisest
realising
that
the
time
of
action
is
over
while
that
of
reminiscence
has
begun
realise
too
that
the
one
is
pregnant
with
greater
pleasures
than
the
other
that
action
indeed
is
only
the
means
to
an
end
of
reflection
and
appreciation
wisest
of
all
the
loafer
stands
apart
supreme
for
he
of
one
mind
with
the
philosopher
as
to
the
end
goes
straight
to
it
at
once
and
his
happy
summer
has
accordingly
been
spent
in
those
subjective
pleasures
of
the
mind
whereof
the
others
the
men
of
muscle
and
peeled
faces
are
only
just
beginning
to
taste
and
yet
though
he
may
a
little
despise
or
rather
pity
them
the
loafer
does
not
dislike
nor
altogether
shun
them
far
from
it
they
are
very
necessary
to
him
for
suave
mari
magno
is
the
motto
of
your
true
loafer
and
it
is
chiefly
by
keeping
ever
in
view
the
struggles
and
the
clamorous
jostlings
of
the
unenlightened
making
holiday
that
he
is
able
to
realise
the
bliss
of
his
own
condition
and
maintain
his
at
and
so
is
he
never
very
far
away
from
the
track
beaten
by
the
hurrying
philistine
hoof
but
hovers
more
or
less
on
the
edge
of
it
where
the
sole
fixed
star
amidst
whirling
constellations
he
may
watch
the
mad
world
glance
and
nod
and
hurry
by
there
are
many
such
centres
of
contemplation
along
the
west
coast
of
scotland
few
places
are
better
than
a
pier
with
its
tranquil
lucid
interval
between
steamers
the
ever
recurrent
throb
of
the
rush
and
foam
of
beaten
water
among
the
piles
splash
of
ropes
and
rumble
of
gangways
and
all
the
attendant
hurry
and
scurry
of
the
human
morrice
here
tanquam
in
speculo
the
loafer
as
he
lounges
may
by
attorney
as
it
were
touch
gently
every
stop
in
the
great
organ
of
the
emotions
of
mortality
rapture
of
meeting
departing
woe
love
at
first
sight
disdain
laughter
indifference
he
may
experience
them
all
but
attenuated
and
as
if
he
saw
them
in
a
dream
as
if
indeed
he
were
heine
god
in
dream
on
a
let
the
drowsy
deity
awake
and
all
these
puppets
emanations
of
his
dream
will
vanish
into
the
nothing
whence
they
came
and
these
emotions
may
be
renewed
each
morning
if
a
fair
one
sail
be
sure
that
one
as
fair
will
land
the
supply
is
inexhaustible
but
in
the
south
perhaps
the
happiest
is
the
gift
of
father
thames
for
there
again
the
contrast
of
violent
action
with
its
blisters
perspiration
and
the
like
throws
into
fine
relief
the
bliss
of
quietism
i
know
one
little
village
in
the
upper
reaches
where
loafing
may
be
pushed
to
high
perfection
here
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
are
vexed
by
the
voices
of
boaters
making
their
way
down
the
little
street
to
the
river
the
most
of
them
go
staggering
under
hampers
bundles
of
waterproofs
and
so
forth
their
voices
are
clamant
of
feats
to
be
accomplished
they
will
row
they
will
punt
they
will
paddle
till
they
weary
out
the
sun
all
this
the
loafer
hears
through
the
open
door
of
his
cottage
where
in
his
he
is
dallying
with
his
bacon
as
a
gentleman
should
he
is
the
only
one
who
has
had
a
comfortable
breakfast
and
he
knows
it
later
he
will
issue
forth
and
stroll
down
in
their
track
to
the
bridge
the
last
of
these
argonauts
is
pulling
lustily
forth
the
river
is
dotted
with
evanishing
blazers
upon
all
these
lunatics
a
pitiless
phoebus
shines
triumphant
the
loafer
sees
the
last
of
them
off
the
stage
turns
his
back
on
it
and
seeks
the
shady
side
of
the
street
a
holy
calm
possesses
the
village
now
the
foreign
element
has
passed
away
with
shouting
and
waving
of
banners
and
its
natural
life
of
somnolency
is
in
evidence
at
last
and
first
as
a
true
loafer
should
let
him
respectfully
greet
each
several
village
dog
arcades
ambo
loafers
likewise
they
lie
there
in
the
warm
dust
each
outside
his
own
door
ready
to
return
the
smallest
courtesy
their
own
lords
and
masters
are
not
given
to
the
exchange
of
compliments
nor
to
greetings
in
the
the
dog
is
generally
the
better
gentleman
and
he
is
aware
of
it
and
he
duly
appreciates
the
loafer
who
is
not
too
proud
to
pause
a
moment
change
the
news
and
pass
the
time
of
day
he
will
mark
his
sense
of
this
attention
by
rising
from
his
and
accompanying
his
caller
some
steps
on
his
way
but
he
will
stop
short
of
his
neighbour
for
the
morning
is
really
too
hot
for
a
shindy
so
by
easy
stages
the
street
is
not
a
long
one
six
dogs
will
see
it
out
the
loafer
quits
the
village
and
now
the
world
is
before
him
shall
he
sit
on
a
gate
and
smoke
or
lie
on
the
grass
and
smoke
or
smoke
aimlessly
and
at
large
along
the
road
such
a
choice
of
happiness
is
distracting
but
perhaps
the
last
course
is
the
best
as
needing
the
least
mental
effort
of
selection
hardly
however
has
he
fairly
started
his
first
daydream
when
the
snappish
ting
of
a
bellkin
recalls
him
to
realities
by
comes
the
bicyclist
dusty
sweating
a
piteous
thing
to
look
upon
but
the
irritation
of
the
strepitant
metal
has
jarred
the
loafer
always
exquisite
nerves
he
is
fain
to
climb
a
gate
and
make
his
way
towards
solitude
and
the
breezy
downs
up
here
all
vestiges
of
a
sordid
humanity
disappear
the
loafer
is
alone
with
the
wind
and
the
blue
sky
only
a
carolling
of
larks
and
a
tinkling
from
distant
flocks
break
the
brooding
noonday
stillness
above
the
hangs
motionless
a
black
dot
on
the
blue
prone
on
his
back
on
the
springy
turf
gazing
up
into
the
sky
his
fleshy
integument
seems
to
drop
away
and
the
spirit
ranges
at
will
among
the
tranquil
clouds
this
way
nirvana
nearest
lies
earth
no
longer
obtrudes
herself
possibly
somewhere
a
thousand
miles
or
so
below
him
the
thing
still
spins
like
a
fretful
midge
the
loafer
knows
not
nor
cares
his
is
now
an
astral
body
and
through
golden
spaces
of
imagination
his
soul
is
winging
her
untrammelled
flight
and
there
he
really
might
remain
for
ever
but
that
his
vagrom
spirit
is
called
back
to
earth
by
a
gentle
but
resistless
very
human
summons
a
gradual
consuming
pantagruelian
thirst
a
thirst
to
thank
heaven
on
so
with
a
sigh
half
of
regret
half
of
anticipation
he
bends
his
solitary
steps
towards
the
nearest
inn
tobacco
for
one
is
good
to
commune
with
oneself
and
be
still
is
truest
wisdom
but
beer
is
a
thing
of
deity
beer
is
divine
later
the
loafer
may
decently
make
some
concession
to
popular
taste
by
strolling
down
to
the
river
and
getting
out
his
boat
with
one
paddle
out
he
will
drift
down
the
stream
just
brushing
the
flowering
rush
and
the
and
taking
in
as
peculiar
gifts
the
varied
sweets
of
even
the
loosestrife
is
his
and
the
his
the
distant
moan
of
the
weir
his
are
the
glories
amber
and
scarlet
and
silver
of
the
surface
the
boaters
will
pass
him
all
are
blistered
and
sore
his
withers
are
unwrung
most
are
too
tired
and
hungry
to
see
the
sunset
glories
no
corporeal
pangs
clog
his
√¶sthesis
his
perceptive
faculty
some
have
quarrelled
in
the
day
and
are
no
longer
on
speaking
terms
he
is
at
peace
with
himself
and
with
the
whole
world
of
all
that
lay
them
down
in
the
little
village
that
night
his
sleep
will
be
the
surest
and
the
sweetest
for
not
even
the
blacksmith
himself
will
have
better
claim
to
have
earned
a
night
repose
cheap
knowledge
when
at
times
it
happens
to
me
that
i
to
be
aweary
of
the
sun
and
to
find
the
fair
apple
of
life
dust
and
ashes
at
the
core
just
because
perhaps
i
ca
afford
melampus
brown
last
volume
of
poems
in
large
paper
but
must
perforce
condescend
upon
the
edition
for
the
million
then
i
bring
myself
to
a
right
temper
by
recalling
to
memory
a
sight
which
now
and
again
in
old
days
would
touch
the
heart
of
me
to
a
happier
pulsation
in
the
long
dark
winter
evenings
outside
some
shop
window
whose
gaslight
flared
brightest
into
the
chilly
street
i
would
see
some
lad
sometimes
even
a
girl
book
in
hand
heedless
of
cold
and
wet
of
aching
limbs
and
straining
eyes
careless
of
jostling
of
rattle
and
turmoil
behind
them
and
about
their
happy
spirits
far
in
an
enchanted
world
till
the
ruthless
shopman
turned
out
the
gas
and
brought
them
rudely
back
to
the
bitter
reality
of
cramped
legs
and
numbed
fingers
my
brother
or
my
sister
i
would
cry
inwardly
feeling
the
link
that
bound
us
together
they
possessed
for
the
hour
the
two
gifts
most
precious
to
the
student
light
and
solitude
the
true
solitude
of
the
roaring
street
somehow
this
vision
rarely
greets
me
now
probably
the
free
libraries
have
supplanted
the
flickering
shop
lights
and
every
lad
and
lass
can
enter
and
call
for
miss
braddon
and
batten
thereon
in
of
leather
and
of
course
this
boon
is
appreciated
and
profited
by
and
we
shall
see
the
divine
results
in
a
year
or
two
and
yet
sometimes
like
the
dear
old
baron
in
the
red
lamp
i
wonder
for
myself
public
libraries
possess
a
special
horror
as
of
lonely
wastes
and
fens
the
stillness
and
the
heavy
air
the
feeling
of
restriction
and
surveillance
the
mute
presence
of
these
other
readers
all
silent
and
all
damned
combine
to
set
up
a
nervous
irritation
fatal
to
quiet
study
had
i
to
choose
i
would
prefer
the
windy
street
and
possibly
others
have
found
that
the
removal
of
checks
and
obstacles
makes
the
path
which
leads
to
the
divine
less
tempting
now
that
it
is
less
rugged
so
full
of
human
nature
are
we
all
still
despite
the
radical
missionaries
that
labour
in
the
vineyard
before
the
national
gallery
was
extended
and
rearranged
there
was
a
little
st
catherine
by
pinturicchio
that
possessed
my
undivided
affections
in
those
days
she
hung
near
the
floor
so
that
those
who
would
worship
must
grovel
and
little
i
grudged
it
whenever
i
found
myself
near
trafalgar
square
with
five
minutes
to
spare
i
used
to
turn
in
and
sit
on
the
floor
before
the
object
of
my
love
till
gently
but
firmly
replaced
on
my
legs
by
the
attendant
she
hangs
on
the
line
now
in
the
grand
new
room
but
i
never
go
to
see
her
somehow
she
is
not
my
st
catherine
of
old
doubtless
free
libraries
affect
many
students
in
the
same
way
on
the
same
principle
as
that
now
generally
accepted
that
it
is
the
restrictions
placed
on
vice
by
our
social
code
which
make
its
pursuit
so
peculiarly
agreeable
but
even
when
the
element
of
human
nature
has
been
fully
allowed
for
it
remains
a
question
whether
the
type
of
mind
that
a
generation
or
two
of
free
libraries
will
evolve
is
or
is
not
the
one
that
the
world
most
desiderates
and
whether
the
spare
reading
and
consequent
fertile
thinking
necessitated
by
the
old
or
style
is
not
productive
of
sounder
results
the
cloyed
and
congested
mind
resulting
from
the
free
run
of
these
grocers
shops
to
omnivorous
appetites
and
all
young
readers
are
omnivorous
bids
fair
to
produce
a
race
of
literary
a
result
from
which
we
may
well
pray
to
be
spared
of
all
forms
of
lettered
effusiveness
that
which
exploits
the
original
work
of
others
and
professes
to
supply
us
with
right
opinions
thereanent
is
the
least
wanted
and
whether
he
take
to
literary
expression
by
pen
or
only
wag
the
tongue
of
him
the
grocer
boy
of
letters
is
sure
to
prove
a
prodigious
bore
the
free
library
if
it
be
fulfilling
the
programme
of
its
advocates
is
breeding
such
as
he
by
scores
but
after
all
there
is
balm
in
gilead
and
much
joy
and
consolation
may
be
drawn
from
the
sorrowful
official
reports
by
which
it
would
appear
that
the
patrons
of
these
libraries
are
confining
their
reading
with
a
charming
unanimity
exclusively
to
novels
and
indeed
they
can
not
do
better
there
is
no
more
blessed
thing
on
earth
than
a
good
novel
not
the
least
merit
of
which
is
that
it
induces
a
state
of
passive
unconscious
enjoyment
and
never
frenzies
the
reader
to
go
out
and
put
the
world
right
next
to
fairy
tales
the
original
our
modern
novels
may
be
ranked
as
our
most
precious
possessions
and
so
it
has
come
to
pass
that
i
shall
now
cheerfully
pay
my
five
shillings
or
ten
shillings
or
whatever
it
may
shortly
be
in
the
pound
towards
the
free
library
convinced
at
last
that
the
money
is
not
wasted
in
training
exponents
of
the
subjectivity
of
this
writer
and
the
objectivity
of
that
nor
in
developing
fresh
imitators
of
dead
discredited
styles
but

devoted
to
the
support
of

naturally
though
it
may
not
be
till
many
a

away
that
you
begin
to
suspect
that
you

these

not

may
hide
their
heads
for
yet
a
little
longer
until
the
growing
tyranny
has
invaded
the
last
common
spinney
and
and
driven
the

man
whither
marginalia
american

in
his
suggestive
talks
about

demands
that
the

shall
be
encouraged
or
rather
permitted
for
the
natural
child
needs
little
encouragement
to
draw
and
he
can
for
says
he
the
child
scribbling
on
the
margin
of
his
is
really
worth
more
to
him
than
all
he
gets
out
of
them
and
indeed
to
him
the
margin
is
the
best
part
of
all
books
and
he
finds
in
it
the
soothing
influence
of
a
clear
sky
in
a
landscape
doubtless
sir
benjamin
backbite
though
his
was
not
an
artist
soul
had
some
dim
feeling
of
this
mighty
truth
when
he
spoke
of
that
new
quarto
of
his
in
which
a
neat
rivulet
of
text
shall
meander
through
a
meadow
of
margin
boldly
granting
the
margin
to
be
of
superior
importance
to
the
print
this
metaphor
is
pleasantly
expanded
in
burton
bookhunter
wherein
you
read
of
certain
folios
with
their
majestic
stream
of
central
print
overflowing
into
rivulets
of
marginal
notes
sedgy
with
citations
but
the
good
doctor
leaves
the
main
stream
for
a
backwater
of
error
in
inferring
that
the
chief
use
of
margins
is
to
be
a
for
notes
and
citations
as
if
they
had
not
absolute
value
in
themselves
nor
served
a
finer
end
in
truth
hunt
child
was
vastly
the
wiser
man
for
myself
my
own
early
margins
chiefly
served
to
note
cite
and
illustrate
the

of

in
more
practical
mood
i
would
stoop
to
render
certain
facts
recorded
in
the
text
to
these
digressions
i
probably
owe
what
little
education
i
possess
for
example
there
was
one
sentence
in
our
roman
history
by
this
single
battle
of
magnesia
antiochus
the
great
lost
all
his
conquests
in
asia
minor
serious
historians
really
should
not
thus
forget
themselves
was
so
easy
by
a
touch
of
the
pen
to
transform
battle
into
bottle
for
conquests
one
could
substitute
a
word
for
which
not
even
macaulay
were
at
a
loss
and
the
result
depicted
with
rude
vigour
in
his
margin
fixed
the
name
of
at
least
one
ancient
fight
on
the
illustrator
memory
but
this
plodding
and
material
art
had
small
charm
for
me
to
whom
the
happy
margin
was
a
clear
sky
ever
through
which
i
could
sail
away
at
will
to
more
gracious
worlds
i
was
duly
qualified
by
a
painfully
acquired
ignorance
of
dead
languages
cautiously
to
approach
my
own
and
was
no
better
along
milton
margins
the
gryphon
must
needs
pursue
the
arimaspian
what
a
chance
that
arimaspian
for
the
imaginative
pencil
and
so
it
has
come
about
that
while
milton
periods
are
mostly
effaced
from
memory
by
the
sponge
of
time
i
can
still
see
that
vengeful
gryphon
to
the
gentle
beast
that
danced
the
lobster
quadrille
by
a
certain
shore
it
is
by
no
means
insisted
upon
that
the
chief
end
and
use
of
margins
is
for
pictorial
illustration
nor
yet
for
furtive
games
of
oughts
and
crosses
nor
in
the
case
of
for
amorous
missives
scrawled
against
the
canticle
for
the
day
to
be
passed
over
into
an
adjacent
pew
as
used
alas
to
happen
in
days
when
one
was
young
and
godless
and
went
to
church
nor
again
are
the
margins
of
certain
poets
entrusted
to
man
for
the
composing
thereon
of
infinitely
superior
rhymes
on
the
subjects
themselves
have
maltreated
a
depraved
habit
akin
to
scalping
what
has
never
been
properly
recognised
is
the
absolute
value
of
the
margin
itself
a
value
frequently
superior
to
its
enclosure
in
poetry
the
popular
taste
demands
its
margin
and
takes
care
to
get
it
in
the
little
verses
wot
they
puts
inside
the
crackers
the
special
popularity
indeed
of
lyric
as
opposed
to
epic
verse
is
due
to
this
habit
of
feeling
a
good
example
maybe
found
in
the
work
of
mr
swinburne
the
latter
is
the
better
poetry
the
earlier
remains
the
more
popular
because
of
its
eloquence
of
margin
mr
tupper
might
long
ago
have
sat
with
laureate
brow
but
for
his
neglect
of
this
first
principle
the
song
of
sigurd
our
one
epic
of
the
century
is
pitiably
unmargined
and
so
has
never
won
the
full
meed
of
glory
it
deserves
while
the
ingenious
gentleman
who
wrote
beowulf
our
other
english
epic
grasped
the
great
fact
from
the
first
so
that
his
work
is
much
the
more
popular
of
the
two
the
moral
is
evident
an
authority
on
practical
has
stated
that
margin
is
a
matter
to
be
studied
also
that
to
place
the
print
in
the
centre
of
the
paper
is
wrong
in
principle
and
to
be
deprecated
now
if
it
be
wrong
in
principle
let
us
push
that
principle
to
its
legitimate
conclusion
and
deprecate
the
placing
of
print
on
any
part
of
the
paper
at
all
without
actually
suggesting
this
course
to
any
of
our
living
bards
when
i
may
ask
when
shall
that
true
poet
arise
who
disdaining
the
trivialities
of
text
shall
give
the
world
a
book
of
verse
consisting
entirely
of
margin
how
we
shall
shove
and
jostle
for
large
paper
copies
the
eternal
whither
there
was
once
an
old
cashier
in
some
ancient
city
establishment
whose
practice
was
to
spend
his
yearly
holiday
in
relieving
some
at
his
post
and
performing
all
the
duties
appertaining
thereunto
this
was
vulgarly
taken
to
be
an
instance
of
mere
enslavement
to
his
groove
the
reception
of
payments
and
it
was
spoken
of
both
in
mockery
of
all
and
for
the
due
admonishment
of
others
and
yet
that
clerk
had
discovered
for
himself
an
unique
method
of
seeing
life
at
its
best
the
flowing
hurrying
travelling
marketing
life
of
the
highway
the
life

the
scanty

persons
who
know
both
what
they
are
good
for
and
what
they
really
want
to
know
what
you
would
like
to

it
is
possible
to
push
one
disregard
for
convention
too
far
as
is
seen
in
the
case
of
another
though
of
an
earlier
generation
in
the
same
establishment
in
his
office
there
was
the
customary
wherein
the
clerks
were
expected
to
sign
each
day
here
his
name
one
morning
ceases
abruptly
from
appearing
he
signs
indeed
no
more
instead
of
signature
you
find
a
little
later
writ
in
careful
commercial
hand
this
entry
mr
did
not
attend
at
his
office
having
been
hanged
at
eight
in
the
morning
for
through
the
faded
ink
of
this
record
do
you
not
seem
to
catch
across
the
gulf
of
years
some
waft
of
the
jolly
humanity
which
breathed
in
this
prince
among
clerks
a
formal
precisian
doubtless
during
business
hours
but
with
just
this
honest
love
of
horseflesh
lurking
deep
down
there
in
him
unsuspected
sweetening
the
whole
lump
can
you
not
behold
him
freed
from
his
desk
turning
to
pursue
his
natural
bent
as
a
dog
still
striveth
to
bury
his
bone
deep
in
the
for
no
filthy
lucre
you
may
be
sure
but
from
sheer
love
of
the
pursuit
itself
all
the
same
he
erred
erred
if
not
in
taste
at
least
in
judgment
for
we
can
not
entirely
acquit
him
of
blame
for
letting
himself
be
caught
in
these
tame
and
tedious
days
of
the
policeman
rampant
our
melancholy
selves
are
debarred
from
many
a
sport
joyous
and
debonair
whereof
our
happier
fathers
were
free
to
be
sure
remains
to
us
but
every
one
is
not
a
collector
and
besides
is
a
diversion
you
can
follow
with
equal
success
all
the
year
round
still
the
instance
may
haply
be
pregnant
with
suggestion
to
many
who
wearily
ask
each
year
what
new
place
or
pursuit
exhausted
earth
still
keeps
for
the
is
a
sad
but
sober
fact
that
the
most
of
men
lead
flat
and
virtuous
lives
departing
annually
with
their
family
to
some
flat
and
virtuous
place
there
to
disport
themselves
in
a
manner
that
is
decent
orderly
wholly
uninteresting
vacant
of
every
buxom
stimulus
to
such
as
these
a
suggestion
in
all
friendliness
why
not
try
crime
we
shall
not
attempt
to
specify
the
particular
branch
for
every
one
must
himself
seek
out
and
find
the
path
his
nature
best
fits
him
to
follow
but
the
general
charm
of
the
prospect
must
be
evident
to
all
the
freshness
and
novelty
of
secrecy
the
artistic
satisfaction
in
doing
the
act
of
as
well
as
it
can
possibly
be
done
the
experience
of
being
not
the
hunter
but
the
hunted
not
the
sportsman
but
the
game
the
delight
of
comparing
and
discussing
crimes
with
your
mates
over
a
quiet
pipe
on
your
return
to
town
these
new
pleasures
these
and
their
like
would
furnish
just
that
gentle
stimulant
that
peaceful
sense
of
change
so
necessary
to
the
tired
worker
and
then
the
fact
that
you
would
naturally
have
to
select
and
plan
out
your
particular
line
of
diversion
without
advice
or
assistance
has
its
own
advantage
for
the
moment
a
man
takes
to
dinning
in
your
ears
that
you
ought
you
really
ought
to
go
to
norway
you
at
once
begin
to
hate
norway
with
a
hate
that
ever
will
be
and
to
have
newlyn
cromer
or
dawlish
carinthia
or
the
austrian
tyrol
jammed
down
your
throat
is
enough
to
initiate
the
discovery
that
your
own
individual
weakness
is
a
joyous
and
persistent
liking
for
manslaughter
some
few
seem
to
be
born
without
much
innate
tendency
to
crime
after
all
it
is
mostly
a
matter
of
heredity
these
unfortunates
are
less
culpable
than
their
neglectful
ancestors
and
it
is
a
fault
that
none
need
really
blush
for
in
the
present
for
such
as
they
there
still
remains
the
example
of
the
clerk
with
all
its
golden
possibilities
denied
the
great
delight
of
driving
a
locomotive
or
a
whirled
along
in
a
glorious
nimbus
of
and
hoarse
warning
roar
what
bliss
to
the
palefaced
quilldriver
to
command
a
penny
steamboat
between
london
bridge
and
chelsea
to
drive
a
to
kew
at
sixpence
a
head
though
turnpikes
be
things
of
the
past
there
are
still
tolls
to
be
taken
on
many
a
pleasant
reach
of
thames
what
happiness
in
quiet
moments
to
tend
the
perhaps
make
love
to
his
daughter
anon
in
busier
times
to
let
the
old
gates
swing
work
the
groaning
winches
and
hear
the
water
lap
and
suck
and
gurgle
as
it
slowly
sinks
or
rises
with
its
swaying
freight
to
dangle
legs
over
the
side
and
greet
old
acquaintances
here
and
there
among
the
wayfarers
passing
up
or
down
while
tobacco
palleth
not
on
the
longest
day
and
beer
is
ever
within
easy
reach
the
iron
tetter
that
scurfs
the
face
of
our
island
has
killed
out
the
pleasant
life
of
the
road
but
many
of
its
best
conditions
still
linger
round
these
old
toll
gates
free
from
dust
and
clatter
on
the
silent
liquid
highway
to
the
west
these
for
the
weaker
brethren
but
for
him
who
is
conscious
of
the
gift
the
path
is
plain
deus

the
practical
roman
stern
constructor
of
roads
and
codes
when
he
needs
must
worship

parcelling
of
the
known
world
into
plots

down

scarce
fail
to

of
solid

we
romans
of
this
latter
day
so
hailed
by
others
or
complacently
christened
by
ourselves
are
roman
in
nothing
more
than
in
this
and
as
much
in
the
less
tangible
realms
of
thought
as
in
our
solid
acres
we
are
fain
to
set
up
the

shall
proclaim
that
so
much
country
is
explored

out

done
with
that
such

such

permissible
and
all

in
this
way
we
are
left

vague
lingering
tradition

the
happier
days

the

yonder
stretch
of

themselves

fellow
his

at

breathed

and
knew
the
kindly

of
sun
and

his
simple
rites
were
performed
amid

by
sunny
roads
or
tranquil
waters
and
on
this
particular
altar

sacrifice
was

to
be

from

smoke
and

on
the
altar
of
expiation
of
smoking
concerning
cigarette
smoking
it
hath
been
well
observed
by
a
certain
philosopher
that
this
is
a
practice
commendable
enough
and
pleasant
to
indulge
in
when
you
not
smoking
wherein
the
whole
criticism
of
the
cigarette
is
found
in
a
little
room
of
the
same
manner
of
thinking
was
one
that
i
knew
who
kept
by
him
an
ample
case
bulging
with
cigarettes
to
smoke
while
he
was
filling
his
pipe
toys
they
be
verily
nug√¶
and
shadows
of
the
substance
serviceable
nevertheless
as
shadows
sometimes
be
when
the
substance
is
temporarily
unattainable
as
between
the
acts
of
a
play
in
the
park
or
while
dressing
for
dinner
that
such
moments
may
not
be
entirely
wasted
that
cigarette
however
which
is
so
prompt
to
appear
after
dinner
i
would
reprehend
and
ban
and
totally
abolish
as
enemy
to
that
diviner
thing
before
which
it
should
pale
its
ineffectual
fires
in
shame
to
wit
good
drink
la
dive
bouteille
except
indeed
when
the
liquor
be
bad
as
is
sometimes
known
to
happen
then
it
may
serve
in
some
sort
as
a
sorry
consolation
but
to
leave
these
airy
substitutes
and
come
to
smoking
it
hath
been
ofttimes
debated
whether
the
morning
pipe
be
the
sweeter
or
that
first
pipe
of
the
evening
which
hesperus
who
bringeth
all
good
things
brings
to
the
weary
with
home
and
rest
the
first
is
smoked
on
a
clearer
palate
and
comes
to
unjaded
senses
like
the
kiss
of
one
first
love
but
lacks
that
feeling
of
perfect
fruition
of
merit
recompensed
and
the
goal
and
the
garland
won
which
clings
to
the
vesper
bowl
whence
it
comes
that
the
majority
give
the
palm
to
the
latter
to
which
i
intend
no
slight
when
i
find
the
incense
that
arises
at
matins
sweeter
even
than
that
of
evensong
for
although
with
most
of
us
who
are
labourers
in
the
vineyard
toilers
and
swinkers
the
morning
pipe
is
smoked
in
hurry
and
fear
and
a
sense
of
alarums
and
excursions
and
fleeting
trains
yet
with
all
this
there
are
certain
halcyon
periods
sure
to
arrive
sundays
holidays
and
the
like
the
whole
joy
and
peace
of
which
are
summed
up
in
that
one
beatific
pipe
after
breakfast
smoked
in
a
careless
majesty
like
that
of
the
gods
when
they
lie
beside
their
nectar
and
the
clouds
are
lightly
curled
then
only
can
we
be
said
really
to
smoke
and
so
this
particular
pipe
of
the
day
always
carries
with
it
festal
reminiscences
memories
of
holidays
past
hopes
for
holidays
to
come
a
suggestion
of
sunny
lawns
and
flannels
and
the
ungirt
loin
a
sense
withal
of
something
free
and
stately
as
of
faint
in
the
air
or
the
old
roman
cry
of
liberty
freedom
and
enfranchisement
if
there
be
any
fly
in
the
ointment
it
may
be
said
to
lurk
in
the
matter
of
rings
only
the
exceptionally
gifted
smoker
can
recline
in
his
chair
and
emit
at
will
the
perfect
in
consummate
eddying
succession
he
of
the
meaner
sort
must
be
content
if
at
rare
intervals
while
thinking
perhaps
of
nothing
less
there
escape
from
his
lips
the
unpremeditated
flawless
circle
then
deus
fio
he
is
moved
to
cry
at
that
breathless
moment
when
his
creation
hangs
solid
and
complete
ere
the
particles
break
away
and
blend
with
the
baser
atmosphere
nay
some
will
deny
to
any
of
us
terrene
smokers
the
gift
of
fullest
achievement
for
what
saith
the
poet
of
the
century
on
the
earth
the
broken
arcs
in
the
heaven
the
perfect
round
it
was
well
observed
by
a
certain
character
in
one
of
wilkie
novels
if
an
imperfect
memory
serveth
me
rightly
that
women
will
take
pleasure
in
scents
derived
from
animal
emanations
clarified
fats
and
the
like
yet
do
illogically
abhor
the
clean
dry
vegetable
smell
of
tobacco
herein
the
true
base
of
the
feminine
objection
is
reached
being
as
usual
inherent
want
of
logic
rather
than
any
distaste
in
the
absolute
for
the
thing
in
question
thinking
that
they
ought
to
dislike
they
do
painfully
cast
about
for
reasons
to
justify
their
dislike
when
none
really
exist
as
a
specimen
of
their
arguments
i
remember
how
a
certain
fair
one
triumphantly
pointed
out
to
me
that
my
dog
though
loving
me
well
could
yet
never
be
brought
to
like
the
smell
of
tobacco
to
whom
i
who
respected
my
dog
as
ben
saith
of
master
shakespeare
on
this
side
idolatry
as
much
as
anything
was
yet
fain
to
point
out
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
that
a
dog
being
an
animal
who
delights
to
pass
his
whole
day
from
early
morn
to
dewy
eve
in
shoving
his
nose
into
every
carrion
beastliness
that
he
can
come
across
could
hardly
be
considered
arbiter
elegantiarum
in
the
matter
of
smells
but
indeed
i
did
wrong
to
take
such
foolish
quibbling
seriously
nor
would
i
have
done
so
if
she
had
dragged
my
poor
innocent
dog
into
the
discussion
of
smoking
in
bed
there
be
who
consider
this
a
depravity
an
instance
of
that
excess
in
the
practice
of
a
virtue
which
passes
into
vice
and
couple
it
with
who
yet
fail
to
justify
themselves
by
argument
for
if
bed
be
by

and
if
tobacco
be
the
true
herb
of
grace
and
a
joy
and
healing
balm
and
respite
and
nepenthe
if
all
this
be
admitted
why
are
two
things
separately
noxious
in
conjunction
and
is
not
the
bed
smoker
rather
an
epicure
in
pleasure
self
indulgent
perhaps
but
still
the
triumphant
creator
of
a
new
blend
reminding
one
of
a
certain
traveller
account
of
an
intoxicant
patronised
in
the
south
sea
islands
which
combines
the
blissful
effect
of
getting
drunk
and
remaining
sober
to
enjoy
it
yet
i
shall
not
insist
too
much
on
this
point
but
would
only
ask
so
long
as
the
smoker
be
unwedded
for
some
tolerance
in
the
matter
and
a
little
logic
in
the
discussion
thereof
concerning
cigars
that
there
be
large
sums
given
for
these
is
within
common
knowledge
nay
even
is
not
too
great
a
price
if
a
man
will
have
of
the
finest
leaf
reckless
of
expense
in
this
sort
of
smoking
however
i
find
more
of
vainglory
and
ostentation
than
solid
satisfaction
and
its
votaries
would
seem
to
display
less
a
calm
healthy
affection
for
tobacco
than
as
sir
browne
hath
it
a
passionate
prodigality
and
besides
grievous
wasting
of
the
pocket
atmospheric
changes
varyings
in
the
crops
and
the
like
cause
uncertainty
to
cling
about
each
individual
weed
so
that
man
is
always
more
or
less
at
the
mercy
of
nature
and
the
elements
an
unsatisfactory
and
undignified
position
in
these
latter
days
of
the
triumphant
democracy
but
worst
and
fatallest
of
all
to
every
it
is
certain
to
happen
that
once
in
his
life
by
some
happy
combination
of
time
place
temperament
and
nature
by
some
starry
influence
maybe
or
freak
of
the
gods
in
mocking
sport
once
and
once
only
he
will
taste
the
aroma
of
the
perfect
leaf
at
just
the
perfect
point
the
ideal
cigar
henceforth
his
life
is
saddened
as
one
kissed
by
a
goddess
in
a
dream
he
goes
thereafter
as
one
might
say
in
a
sort
of
seeking
he
scarce
knows
what
his
existence
becomes
a
dissatisfied
yearning
the
world
is
spoiled
for
him
its
joys
are
tasteless
so
he
wanders
down
dreary
days
to
some
miserable
end
yet
if
one
will
walk
this
path
and
take
the
risks
the
thing
may
be
done
at
comparatively
small
expense
to
such
i
would
commend
the
roman
motto
slightly
altered
alieni
appetens
sui
avarus
there
be
always
good
fellows
with
good
cigars
for
their
friends
nay
too
the
boxes
of
these
lie
open
an
the
good
cigar
belongs
rather
to
him
that
can
appreciate
it
aright
than
to
the
capitalist
who
owing
to
a
false
social
system
happens
to
be
its
temporary
guardian
and
trustee
again
there
is
a
saying
bred
first
i
think
among
the
schoolmen
at
oxford
that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
son
to
live
up
to
his
income
should
any
young
man
have
found
this
task
too
hard
for
him
after
the
most
strenuous
and
efforts
at
least
he
can
resolutely
smoke
his
father
cigars
in
the
path
of
duty
complete
success
is
not
always
to
be
looked
for
but
an
approving
conscience
the
sure
reward
of
honest
endeavour
is
within
reach
of
all
an
autumn
encounter
for
yet
another
mile
or
two
the
hot
dusty
road
runs
through
level
fields
till
it
reaches
yonder
shoulder
of
the
downs
already
golden
up
with
ripening
corn
thitherwards
lies
my
inevitable
way
and
now
that
home
is
almost
in
sight
it
seems
hard
that
the
last
part
of
the
long
day
sweltering
and
delightful
tramp
must
needs
be
haunted
by
that
hateful
speck
black
on
the
effulgence
of
the
slope
did
i
not
know
he
was
only
a
scarecrow
the
thing
might
be
in
a
way
companionable
a
pleasant
suggestive
surmise
piquing
curiosity
gilding
this
last
weary
stage
with
some
magic
of
expectancy
but
i
passed
close
by
him
on
my
way
out
early
as
i
was
he
was
already
up
and
doing
eager
to
introduce
himself
he
leered
after
me
as
i
swung
down
the
road
mimicked
my
gait
as
it
seemed
in
a
most
way
and
when
i
looked
back
he
was
blowing
derisive
kisses
of
farewell
with
his
empty
sleeve
i
had
succeeded
however
in
shaking
off
the
recollection
between
the
morning
start
and
now
so
it
was
annoying
that
he
should
force
himself
on
me
just
when
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
him
at
this
distance
however
he
might
be
anything
an
indeterminate
blot
it
seems
to
waver
to
falter
to
come
and
vanish
again
in
the
quivering
heated
air
even
so
in
the
old
time
leaning
on
that
familiar
gate
are
the
inwoven
initials
still
decipherable
i
used
to
watch
her
pacing
demurely
towards
me
through
the
corn
it
was
ridiculous
it
was
fatuous
under
all
the
circumstances
it
was
monstrous
and
yet
we
were
both
under
twenty
so
she
was
she
and
i
was
i
and
there
were
only
we
three
the
wide
world
over
she
and
i
and
the
unbetraying
gate
porta
eburnea
false
visions
alone
sped
through
you
though
cupid
was
wont
to
light
on
your
topmost
bar
and
preen
his
glowing
plumes
and
to
think
that
i
should
see
her
once
more
coming
down
the
path
as
if
not
a
day
had
passed
hesitating
as
of
old
and
then
but
surely
her
ankles
seem
confound
that
scarecrow
his
sex
is
by
this
time
painfully
evident
also
his
condition
in
life
which
is
as
of
one
looking
back
on
better
days
and
now
he
is
upon
a
new
tack
though
here
on
the
level
it
is
still
sultry
and
airless
an
evening
breeze
is
playing
briskly
along
the
slope
where
he
stands
and
one
sleeve
saws
the
air
violently
the
other
is
pointed
stiffly
heavenwards
it
is
all
plain
enough
my
poor
friend
the
sins
of
the
world
are
a
heavy
burden
and
a
grievous
unto
you
you
have
a
mission
you
must
testify
it
will
forth
in
season
and
out
of
season
for
man
he
wakes
and
sleeps
and
sins
betimes
but
crows
sin
steadily
without
any
cessation
and
this
unhappy
state
of
things
is
your
own
particular
business
even
at
this
distance
i
seem
to
hear
you
rasping
it
salvation
damnation
damnation
salvation
and
the
jolly
earth
smiles
in
the
perfect
evenglow
and
the
corn
ripples
and
laughs
all
round
you
and
one
young
rook
only
fledged
this
year
too
after
an
excellent
simulation
of
prostrate
penitence
soars
joyously
away
to
make
love
to
his
neighbour
wife
salvation
damnation
damn
a
shifty
wriggle
of
the
road
and
he
is
transformed
once
more
flung
back
in
an
ecstasy
of
laughter
holding
his
lean
sides
his
whole
form
writhes
with
the
chuckle
and
gurgle
of
merriment
ho
ho
what
a
joke
it
was
how
i
took
you
all
in
even
the
rooks
what
a
joke
is
everything
to
be
sure
truly
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
quit
of
this
heartless
mummer
fortunately
i
shall
soon
be
past
him
and
now
behold
the
old
dog
waxes
amorous
mincing
mowing
empty
sleeve
on
hollow
breast
he
would
fain
pose
as
the
most
irresistible
old
hypocrite
that
ever
paced
a
metropolitan
kerb
love
you
young
dogs
he
seems
to
croak
love
is
the
one
thing
worth
living
for
enjoy
your
present
rooks
and
all
as
i
do
why
indeed
should
he
alone
be
insensible
to
the
golden
influence
of
the
hour
more
than
one
supple
waist
alas
for
universal
masculine
frailty
has
been
circled
by
that
tattered
sleeve
in
days
gone
by
a
throbbing
heart
once
beat
where
sodden
straw
now
fails
to
give
a
manly
curve
to
the
chest
why
should
the
coat
survive
and
not
a
particle
of
the
passion
that
inspired
it
long
ago
at
last
i
confront
him
face
to
face
and
the
villain
grins
recognition
completely
unabashed
nay
he
cocks
his
eye
with
a
significant
glance
under
the
slouch
of
his
shapeless
hat
and
his
arm
points
persistently
and
with
intelligence
up
the
road
my
good
fellow
i
know
the
way
to
the
dog
and
duck
as
well
as
you
do
i
was
going
there
anyhow
without
your
officious
interference
and
the
beer
as
you
justly
remark
is
unimpeachable
but
was
this
really
all
been
trying
to
say
to
me
this
last
well
well
the
white
poppy
a
riot
of
scarlet
on
gold
the
red
poppy
of
our
native
fields
tosses
heavy
tresses
with
gipsy
abandon
her
sister
of
the
is
golden
a
yellow
blossom
that
loves
the
keen
salt
savour
of
the
spray
of
another
hue
is
the
poppy
of
history
of
romance
of
the
muse
white
as
the
stark
pallid
as
the
cheeks
of
that
queen
of
a
silent
land
whose
temples
she
languorously
crowns
beside
her
kin
she
droops
papaver
somniferum
the
poppy
of
the
magic
juice
of
oblivion
in
the
royal
plenitude
of
summer
the
scarlet
blooms
will
sometimes
seem
but
a
red
cry
from
earth
in
memory
of
the
many
dews
of
battle
that
have
drenched
these
acres
in
years
gone
by
for
little
end
but
that
these
same
bubbles
of
blood
might
glow
the
yellow
flower
does
but
hint
of
the
gold
that
has
dashed
a
thousand
wrecks
at
her
feet
around
these
shores
for
happier
suggestion
we
must
turn
to
her
of
the
pallid
petals
our
white
lady
of
consolation
fitting
hue
to
typify
the
crowning
blessing
of
forgetfulness
too
often
the
sable
robes
of
night
dissemble
sleeplessness
remorse
regret
let
black
then
rather
stand
for
hideous
memory
white
for
blessed
blank
oblivion
happiest
gift
of
the
gods
for
who
indeed
can
say
that
the
record
of
his
life
is
not
crowded
with
failure
and
mistake
stained
with
its
petty
cruelties
of
youth
its
meannesses
and
follies
of
later
years
all
which
storm
and
clamour
incessantly
at
the
gates
of
memory
refusing
to
be
shut
out
leave
us
alone
o
gods
to
remember
our
felicities
our
successes
only
aid
us
ye
who
recall
no
gifts
aptly
and
discreetly
to
forget
discreetly
we
say
for
it
is
a
tactful
forgetfulness
that
makes
for
happiness
in
the
minor
matter
for
instance
of
small
money
obligations
that
shortness
of
memory
which
the
school
of
professors
panurge
and
falstaff
rashly
praises
may
often
betray
into
some
unfortunate
allusion
or
reference
to
the
subject
which
shall
pain
the
delicate
feelings
of
the
obliger
or
if
he
be
of
coarser
clay
shall
lead
him
in
his
anger
to
express
himself
with
unseemliness
and
thereby
to
do
violence
to
his
mental
tranquillity
in
which
alone
as
marcus
aurelius
teacheth
lieth
the
perfection
of
moral
character
this
is
to
be
a
and
an
offence
against
the
brethren
it
is
better
to
keep
just
memory
enough
to
avoid
such
hidden
rocks
and
shoals
in
which
thing
mr
swiveller
is
our
great
exemplar
whose
mental
map
of
london
was
a
chart
wherein
every
creditor
was
carefully
buoyed
the
wise
man
prays
we
are
told
for
a
good
digestion
let
us
add
to
the
prayer
and
a
bad
memory
truly
we
are
sometimes
tempted
to
think
that
we
are
the
only
ones
cursed
with
this
corroding
canker
our
friends
we
can
swear
have
all
without
exception
atrocious
memories
why
is
ours
alone
so
hideously
vital
yet
this
isolation
must
be
imaginary
for
even
as
we
engage
in
this
selfish
moan
for
help
in
our
own
petty
case
we
are
moved
to
add
a
word
for
certain
others
who
meaning
no
ill
unthinkingly
go
about
to
add
to
already
heavy
load
of
suffering
how
much
needless
misery
is
caused
in
this
world
by
the
reckless
recollections
of
dramatic
and
other
celebrities
you
gods
in
lending
ear
to
our
prayer
remember
too
above
all
other
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
these
our
poor
erring
brothers
and
sisters
the
sometime
sommit√©s
of
mummerdom
moments
there
are
it
is
true
when
this
traitor
spirit
tricks
you
when
some
subtle
scent
some
broken
notes
of
an
old
song
nay
even
some
touch
of
a
fresher
air
on
your
cheeks
at
night
a
breath
of
le
vent

montagne
have
power
to
ravish
to
catch
you
back
to
the
blissful
days
when
you
trod
the
one
authentic
paradise
moments
only
alas
then
the
evil
crowd
rushes
in
again
howls
in
the
sacred
grove
tramples
down
and
defiles
the
happy
garden
and
once
more
you
cry
to
our
lady
of
sleep
crowned
of
the
white
poppy
and
you
envy
your
dog
who
for
full
discharge
of
a
present
benefaction
having
wagged
you
a
hearty
expressive
tail
will
then
pursue
it
gently
round
the
till
in
restful
coil
he
reaches
it
at
last
and
oblivion
with
it
every
one
of
his
diurnal
sleeps
being
in
truth
a
royal
amnesty
but
whose
the
hand
that
shall
reach
us
the
herb
of
healing
perdita
blesses
every
guest
at
the
shearing
with
a
handful
of
blossom
but
this
gift
is
not
to
be
asked
of
her
whose
best
wish
to
her
friends
is
grace
and
remembrance
the
fair
ophelia
rather
nay
for
as
a
nursling
she
hugs
her
grief
and
for
her
the
memory
of
the
past
is
a
sorrow
crown
of
sorrow
what
flowers
are
these
her
pale
hand
offers
there
pansies
that
for
thoughts
for
me
rather
o
dear
ophelia
the
white
poppy
of
forgetfulness
a
bohemian
in
exile
a
reminiscence
when
many
years
ago
now
the
once
potent
and
extensive
kingdom
of
bohemia
gradually
dissolved
and
passed
away
not
a
few
historians
were
found
to
chronicle
its
past
glories
and
some
have
gone
on
to
tell
the
fate
of
this
or
that
once
powerful
chieftain
who
either
donned
the
and
conformed
or
proudly
sought
some
quiet
retreat
and
died
as
he
had
lived
a
bohemian
but
these
were
of
the
princes
of
the
land
to
the
people
the
villeins
the
common
rank
and
file
does
no
interest
attach
did
they
waste
and
pine
an√¶mic
in
thin
strange
unwonted
air
or
sit
at
the
table
of
the
scornful
and
learn
with
dante
how
salt
was
alien
bread
it
is
of
one
of
those
faithful
commons
i
would
speak
narrating
only
the
short
and
simple
annals
of
the
poor
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
kingdom
aforesaid
was
not
so
much
a
kingdom
as
a
united
states
a
collection
of
guilds
municipalities
or
republics
bound
together
by
a
common
method
of
viewing
life
there
once
was
a
king
of
bohemia
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
and
even
corporal
trim
was
not
certain
in
whose
reign
it
was
these
small
free
states
then
broke
up
gradually
from
various
causes
and
with
varying
speed
and
i
think
ours
was
one
of
the
last
to
go
with
us
as
with
many
others
it
was
a
case
of
lost
leaders
just
for
a
handful
of
silver
he
left
us
though
it
was
not
exactly
that
but
rather
that
having
got
the
handful
of
silver
they
wanted
a
wider
horizon
to
fling
it
about
under
than
bloomsbury
afforded
so
they
left
us
for
their
pleasure
and
in
due
time
one
by
one
but
i
will
not
be
morose
about
them
they
had
honestly
earned
their
success
and
we
all
honestly
rejoiced
at
it
and
do
so
still
when
old
pan
was
dead
and
apollo
bow
broken
there
were
many
faithful
pagans
who
would
worship
at
no
new
shrines
but
went
out
to
the
hills
and
caves
truer
to
the
old
gods
in
their
discrowned
desolation
than
in
their
pomp
and
power
even
so
were
we
left
behind
a
remnant
of
the
faithful
we
had
never
expected
to
become
great
in
art
or
song
it
was
the
life
itself
that
we
loved
that
was
our
end
not
as
with
them
the
means
to
an
end
we
aimed
at
no
glory
no
lovers
of
glory
we
give
us
the
glory
of
going
on
and
still
to
be
unfortunately
going
on
was
no
longer
possible
the
old
order
had
changed
and
we
could
only
patch
up
our
broken
lives
as
best
might
be
fothergill
said
that
he
for
one
would
have
no
more
of
it
the
past
was
dead
and
he
was
going
to
try
to
revive
it
henceforth
he
too
would
be
dead
to
bloomsbury
our
forefathers
speaking
of
a
death
said
he
changed
his
life
this
is
how
fothergill
changed
his
life
and
died
to
bloomsbury
one
morning
he
made
his
way
to
the
whitechapel
road
and
there
he
bought
a
barrow
the
whitechapel
barrows
are
of
all
sizes
from
the
barrow
wheeled
about
by
a
boy
with
half
a
dozen
heads
of
cabbages
to
barrows
drawn
by
a
tall
pony
such
as
on
sundays
take
the
members
of
a
club
to
epping
forest
they
are
all
precisely
the
same
in
plan
and
construction
only
in
the
larger
sizes
the
handles
develop
or
evolve
into
shafts
and
they
are
equally
suitable
according
to
size
for
the
vending
of
whelks
for
a
can
a
piano
organ
or
for
the
conveyance
of
a
cheery
and
numerous
party
to
the
derby
fothergill
bought
a
medium
sized
developed
one
and
also
a
donkey
to
fit
he
had
it
painted
white
picked
out
with
green
the
barrow
not
the
donkey
and
when
his
arrangements
were
complete
stabled
the
whole
for
the
night
in
bloomsbury
the
following
morning
before
the
early
red
had
quite
faded
from
the
sky
the
exodus
took
place
those
of
us
who
were
left
being
assembled
to
drink
a
parting
in
sad
and
solemn
silence
fothergill
turned
down
oxford
street
sitting
on
the
shaft
with
a
short
clay
in
his
mouth
and
disappeared
from
our
sight
heading
west
at
a
leisurely
pace
so
he
passed
out
of
our
lives
by
way
of
the
bayswater
road
they
must
have
wandered
far
and
seen
many
things
he
and
his
donkey
from
the
fitful
fragments
of
news
that
now
and
again
reached
us
it
seems
that
eventually
his
style
of
living
being
economical
he
was
enabled
to
put
down
his
donkey
and
barrow
and
set
up
a
cart
and
a
mare
no
fashionable
a
sort
of
houseboat
on
wheels
but
a
light
and
serviceable
cart
with
a
moveable
tilt
constructed
on
his
own
designs
this
allowed
him
to
take
along
with
him
a
few
canvases
and
other
artists
materials
whisky
and
such
like
necessaries
and
even
to
ask
a
friend
from
town
for
a
day
or
two
if
he
wanted
to
he
was
in
this
state
of
comparative
luxury
when
at
last
by
the
merest
accident
i
foregathered
with
him
once
more
i
had
pulled
up
to
streatley
one
afternoon
and
leaving
my
boat
had
gone
for
a
long
ramble
on
the
glorious
north
berkshire
downs
to
stretch
my
legs
before
dinner
somewhere
over
on
cuckhamsley
hill
by
the
side
of
the
ridgeway
remote
from
the
habitable
world
i
found
him
smoking
his
vesper
pipe
on
the
shaft
of
his
cart
the
mare
cropping
the
short
grass
beside
him
he
greeted
me
without
surprise
or
effusion
as
if
we
had
only
parted
yesterday
and
without
a
hint
of
an
allusion
to
past
times
but
drifted
quietly
into
rambling
talk
of
his
last
three
years
and
without
ever
telling
his
story
right
out
left
a
strange
picturesque
impression
of
a
nomadic
life
which
struck
one
as
separated
by
fifty
years
from
modern
conventional
existence
the
old
still
lingered
on
in
places
it
seemed
once
one
got
well
away
from
the
railway
there
were
two
englands
existing
together
the
one
fringing
the
great
iron
highways
wherever
they
might
go
the
england
under
the
eyes
of
most
of
us
the
other
unguessed
at
by
many
in
whatever
places
were
still
vacant
of
shriek
and
rattle
drowsed
on
as
of
old
the
england
of
heath
and
common
and
windy
sheep
down
of
and
the
england
of
parson
adams
and
lavengro
the
spell
of
the
free
untrammelled
life
came
over
me
as
i
listened
till
i
was
fain
to
accept
of
his
hospitality
and
a
for
the
night
oblivious
of
civilised
comforts
down
at
the
bull
on
the
downs
where
alfred
fought
we
lay
and
smoked
gazing
up
at
the
quiet
stars
that
had
shone
on
many
a
dane
lying
stark
and
still
a
thousand
years
ago
and
in
the
silence
of
the
lone
tract
that
enfolded
us
we
seemed
nearer
to
those
old
times
than
to
these
i
had
left
that
afternoon
in
the
now
hushed
and
sleeping
valley
of
the
thames
when
the
news
reached
me
some
time
later
that
fothergill
aunt
had
died
and
left
him
her
house
near
town
and
the
little
all
she
had
possessed
i
heard
it
with
misgivings
not
to
say
forebodings
for
the
house
had
been
his
grandfather
and
he
had
spent
much
of
his
boyhood
there
it
had
been
a
dream
of
his
early
days
to
possess
it
in
some
happy
future
and
i
knew
he
could
never
bear
to
sell
or
let
it
on
the
other
hand
can
you
stall
the
wild
ass
of
the
desert
and
will
not
the
caged
eagle
mope
and
pine
however
possession
was
entered
into
and
all
seemed
to
go
well
for
the
time
the
cart
was
honourably
installed
in
the
the
mare
turned
out
to
grass
fothergill
lived
idly
and
happily
to
all
seeming
with
a
book
of
verses
underneath
the
bough
and
a
bottle
of
old
claret
for
the
friend
who
might
chance
to
drop
in
but
as
the
year
wore
on
small
signs
began
to
appear
that
he
who
had
always
rather
hear
the
lark
sing
than
the
mouse
squeak
was
beginning
to
feel
himself
caged
though
his
bars
were
gilded
i
was
talking
one
day
to
his
coachman
he
now
kept
three
and
he
told
me
that
of
a
sunday
morning
when
the
household
had
gone
to
church
and
everything
was
quiet
mr
fothergill
would
go
into
the
and
light
his
pipe
and
sit
on
the
step
of
the
brougham
he
had
a
brougham
now
and
gaze
at
the
old
cart
and
smoke
and
say
nothing
and
smoke
and
say
nothing
again
he
did
like
it
the
coachman
confessed
and
to
me
it
seemed
ominous
one
morning
late
in
march
at
the
end
of
a
long
hard
winter
i
was
wakened
by
a
flood
of
sunshine
the
early
air
came
warm
and
soft
through
the
open
window
the
first
magic
suggestion
of
spring
was
abroad
with
its
whispered
hints
of
daffodils
and
budding
hawthorns
and
one
blood
danced
to
imagined
pipings
of
pan
from
happy
fields
far
distant
at
once
i
thought
of
fothergill
and
with
a
certain
foreboding
of
ill
made
my
way
down
to
holly
lodge
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
with
no
surprise
at
all
that
i
heard
that
the
master
was
missing
in
the
very
first
of
the
morning
it
seemed
or
ever
the
earliest
had
begun
to
set
on
the
stairs
and
along
the
passages
he
must
have
quietly
left
the
house
the
servants
were
cheerful
enough
nevertheless
and
thought
the
master
must
only
have
gone
for
a
nice
long
walk
and
so
on
after
the
manner
of
their
kind
without
a
word
i
turned
my
steps
to
the
sure
enough
the
old
cart
was
missing
the
mare
was
gone
from
the
paddock
it
was
no
good
my
saying
anything
pursuit
of
this
wild
haunter
of
tracks
and
would
have
been
futile
indeed
so
i
kept
my
own
counsel
fothergill
never
returned
to
holly
lodge
and
has
been
more
secret
and
evasive
since
his
last
flight
rarely
venturing
on
old
camping
grounds
near
home
like
to
a
bird
scared
by
the
fowler
gun
once
indeed
since
then
while
engaged
in
pursuit
of
the
shy
quarry
known
as
the
early
late
e
and
the
like
specimens
of
which
i
was
tracking
down
in
the
west
i
hit
upon
him
by
accident
hearing
in
an
old
village
rumours
concerning
a
strange
man
in
a
cart
who
neither
carried
samples
nor
pushed
the
brewing
interest
by
other
means
than
average
personal
consumption
tales
already
beginning
to
be
distorted
into
material
for
the
myth
of
the
future
i
found
him
friendly
as
ever
equally
ready
to
spin
his
yarns
as
the
evening
wore
on
i
ventured
upon
an
allusion
to
past
times
and
holly
lodge
but
his
air
of
puzzled
politeness
convinced
me
that
the
whole
thing
had
passed
out
of
his
mind
as
a
slight
but
disagreeable
incident
in
the
even
tenor
of
his
nomadic
existence
after
all
his
gains
may
have
outbalanced
his
losses
had
he
cared
he
might
with
his
conversational
gifts
have
been
a
social
success
certainly
i
think
an
artistic
one
he
had
great
powers
had
any
impulse
been
present
to
urge
him
to
execution
and
achievement
but
he
was
for
none
of
these
things
contemplative
receptive
with
a
keen
sense
of
certain
and
side
aspects
of
life
unseen
by
most
he
doubtless
chose
wisely
to
enjoy
life
his
own
way
and
to
gather
from
the
fleeting
days
what
bliss
they
had
to
give
nor
spend
them
in
toiling
for
a
harvest
to
be
reaped
when
he
was
dust
some
for
the
glories
of
this
life
and
some
sigh
for
the
prophet
paradise
to
come
ah
take
the
cash
and
let
the
credit
go
nor
heed
the
rumble
of
a
distant
drum
justifiable
homicide
this
is
a
remedial
age
an
age
of
keys
for
all
manner
of
locks
so
he
can
not
be
said
to
ask
too
much
who
seeks
for
exact
information
as
to
how
a
young
man
ought
in
justice
to
himself
and
to
society
to
deal
with
his
relations
during
his
minority
he
has
lain
entirely
at
their
mercy
has
been
their
butt
their
martyr
their
drudge
their
corpus
vile
possessing
all
the
sinews
of
war
this
tribe
has
consistently
refused
to
part
even
for
the
provision
of
those
luxuries
so
much
more
necessary
than
necessities
its
members
have
crammed
their
victim
full
of
precepts
rules
of
conduct
moral
maxims
and
most
miscellaneous
counsel
all
which
he
intuitively
suspected
at
the
time
and
has
ascertained
by
subsequent
experience
to
be
utterly
worthless
now
when
their
hour
has
come
when
the
tocsin
has
sounded
at
last
and
the
gaul
is
at
the
gate
they
still
appear
to
think
that
the
old
condition
of
things
is
to
go
on
unconscious
apparently
of
atonement
due
of
retribution
to
be
exacted
of
wrongs
to
be
avenged
and
of
insults
to
be
wiped
away
over
the
frontier
where
the
writ
of
the
english
raj
runs
not
the
artless
afghan
is
happy
in
a
code
that
fully
provides
for
relatives
who
neglect
or
misunderstand
their
obligations
an
afghan
it
was
who
found
himself
compelled
to
reprove
an
uncle
with
an
unfortunate
habit
of
squandering
the
family
estate
an
excellent
relative
this
uncle
in
all
other
respects
as
a
liar
he
had
few
equals
he
robbed
with
taste
and
discretion
and
his
murders
were
all
imbued
with
true
artistic
feeling
he
might
have
lived
to
a
green
old
age
of
spotless
respectability
but
for
his
one
little
failing
as
it
was
justice
had
to
be
done
ruat
c√¶lum
and
so
it
came
about
that
one
day
the
nephew
issued
forth
to
correct
him
with
a
matchlock
the
innocent
old
man
was
cultivating
his
paternal
acres
so
the
nephew
was
able
unperceived
to
get
a
steady
sight
on
him
his
finger
was
on
the
trigger
when
suddenly
there
slipped
into
his
mind
the
divine
precept
allah
is
merciful
he
lowered
his
piece
and
remained
for
a
little
plunged
in
thought
meanwhile
the
unconscious
uncle
hoed
his
paddy
then
with
a
happy
smile
he
took
aim
once
more
for
there
also
occurred
to
him
the
precept
equally
divine
but
allah
is
also
just
with
an
easy
conscience
he
let
fly
and
behold
there
was
an
uncle
the
more
in
paradise
it
was
probably
some
little
affair
of
a
similar
quality
that
constrained
a
recruit
in
a
regiment
stationed
at
peshawur
to
apply
for
leave
of
absence
in
order
to
attend
to
family
matters
of
importance
the
colonel
knew
it
was
small
use
refusing
the
leave
as
in
that
case
his
recruit
would
promptly
desert
so
he
could
only
ask
how
long
was
the
transaction
like
to
take
it
was
told
him
after
consideration
that
allowing
for
all
possible
difficulties
and
delays
a
month
would
meet
the
necessities
of
the
case
and
on
that
understanding
he
allowed
his
man
to
depart
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
reappeared
on
duty
a
subdued
but
mellow
cheer
shining
through
his
wonted
impassiveness
his
colonel
ventured
to
inquire
of
him
in
a
general
way
if
the
business
in
question
were
satisfactorily
concluded
and
he
replied
i
got
him
from
behind
a
rock
there
are
practical
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
adoption
of
such
methods
at
home
we
must
be
content
to
envy
without
imitating
these
free
and
happy
sons
of
the
hills
and
yet
a
few
of
the
old
school
are
left
us
still
averse
from
change
mistrustful
of
progress
sticking
steadily
to
the
good
dagger
and
bowl
i
had
a
friend
who
disposed
of
a
relative
every
spring
uncles
were
his
special
line
he
had
suffered
much
from
their
tribe
having
been
early
left
an
orphan
though
he
had
dabbled
in
aunts
and
in
his
hot
youth
when
he
was
getting
his
hand
in
he
had
even
dallied
with
a
or
two
but
it
was
in
uncles
he
excelled
he
possessed
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
a
large
number
of
these
connections
and
pursuit
of
them
from
the
mere
sordid
point
of
view
of
proved
lucrative
but
he
always
protested
and
i
believed
him
that
gain
with
him
was
a
secondary
consideration
it
would
hardly
be
in
the
public
interest
to
disclose
his
modus
operandi
i
shall
only
remark
that
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
realise
the
security
and
immunity
afforded
the
artist
by
the
conditions
of
modern
london
hence
it
happened
that
he
usually
practised
in
town
but
spent
his
vacations
at
the
country
houses
of
such
relations
as
were
still
spared
him
where
he
was
always
the
life
and
soul
of
the
place
unfortunately
he
is
no
longer
with
us
to
assist
in
the
revision
of
this
article
nor
was
it
permitted
me
to
soothe
his
last
moments
the
presiding
sheriff
was
one
of
those
officials
who
insist
on
the
exclusion
of
the
public
and
he
declined
to
admit
me
either
in
the
capacity
of
a
personal
connection
or
though
i
tried
my
hardest
as
the
representative
of
the
national
observer
it
only
remains
to
be
said
of
my
and
still
lamented
friend
that
he
left
few
relatives
to
mourn
his
untimely
end
but
our
reluctant
feet
must
needs
keep
step
with
the
imperious
march
of
time
and
my
poor
friend
art
as
himself
in
later
years
would
sorrowfully
admit
is
now
almost
as
extinct
as
the
of
old
or
robbia
craft
so
apt
and
strange
while
our
youth
too
nice
for
the
joyous
old
methods
are
content
to
find
sweetest
revenge
in
severely
dropping
their
relations
this
is
indeed
a
most
effective
position
it
exasperates
while
it
is
unassailable
and
yet
there
remains
a
higher
course
a
nobler
task
not
mere
forgiveness
it
is
simple
duty
to
forgive
even
one
guardians
no
young
man
of
earnest
aspirations
will
be
content
to
stop
there
nay
lead
them
on
these
lost
ones
by
the
hand
conduct
them
generously
and
gently
and
with
linking
of
the
arm
educate
them
eradicate
their
false
ideals
dispel
their
foolish
prejudices
be
to
their
faults
a
little
blind
and
to
their
virtues
very
kind
in
fine
realise
that
you
have
a
mission
that
these
wretches
are
not
here
for
nothing
the
task
will
seem
hard
at
first
but
only
those
who
have
tried
can
know
how
much
may
be
done
by
assiduous
and
kindly
effort
towards
the
chastening
ay
the
final
redemption
even
of
the
most
hopeless
and
of
uncles
the
fairy
wicket
from
digging
in
the
sandy
soil
of
times
historical
all
dotted
with
date
and
number
and
sign
how
exquisite
the
relief
in
turning
to
the
dear
days
outside
history
yet
not
so
very
far
off
neither
for
us
nurslings
of
the
northern
sun
when
kindly
beasts
would
loiter
to
give
counsel
by
the
wayside
and
a
fortunate
encounter
with
one
of
the
good
people
was
a
surer
path
to
fortune
and
the
bride
than
the
stool
that
ever
proved
to
aspiring
youth
for
then
the
fairy
wicket
stood
everywhere
ajar
everywhere
and
to
each
and
all
open
open
green
hill
you
needed
no
more
recondite
sesame
than
that
and
whoever
you
were
you
might
have
a
glimpse
of
the
elfin
dancers
in
the
hall
that
is
litten
within
by
neither
sun
nor
moon
or
catch
at
the
white
horse
bridle
as
the
fairy
prince
rode
through
it
has
been
closed
now
this
many
a
year
the
fairies
always
strong
in
the
field
are
excellent
and
if
it
open
at
all
is
but
for
a
mockery
of
the
material
generation
that
so
deliberately
turned
its
back
on
the
gap
into
that
first
stage
to
the
beyond
it
was
a
wanton
trick
though
that
these
folk
of
malice
used
to
play
on
a
small
new
kicked
out
of
his
nest
into
the
draughty
uncomfortable
outer
world
his
unfledged
skin
still
craving
the
feathers
whereinto
he
was
wont
to
nestle
the
school
the
arid
cheerless
drove
him
to
nature
for
redress
and
under
an
alien
sky
he
would
go
forth
and
wander
along
the
iron
road
by
impassive
fields
so
like
yet
so
unlike
those
hitherto
a
part
of
him
and
responding
to
his
every
mood
and
to
him
thus
loitering
with
overladen
heart
there
would
come
suddenly
a
touch
of
warmth
of
strange
surprise
the
turn
of
the
road
just
ahead
that
sure
is
not
all
unfamiliar
that
row
of
elms
it
can
not
entirely
be
accident
that
they
range
just
so
and
if
not
accident
then
round
the
bend
will
come
the
old
the
shoulder
of
the
barn
will
top
it
a
few
yards
on
will
be
the
gate
it
with
its
familiar
click
the
dogs
race
down
the
avenue
and
then
and
then
it
is
all
wildly
fanciful
and
yet
though
knowing
not
tertullian
a
credo
quia
impossibile
is
on
his
tongue
as
he
quickens
his
pace
for
what
else
can
he
do
a
step
and
the
spell
is
shattered
all
is
cruel
and
alien
once
more
while
every
copse
and
seems
with
faint
elfish
laughter
the
fairies
have
had
their
joke
they
have
opened
the
wicket
one
of
their
own
and
shut
it
in
their
victim
face
when
next
that
victim
catches
a
fairy
he
purposes
to
tie
up
the
brat
in
sight
of
his
own
green
hill
and
set
him
to
draw
up
a
practical
scheme
for
village
councils
one
of
the
many
women
i
ever
really
loved
fair
in
the
fearless
old
fashion
was
used
to
sing
in
the
blithe
unfettered
accent
of
the
people
i
like
to
be
a
fairy
and
dance
upon
my
toes
i
like
to
be
a
fairy
and
wear
short
close
and
in
later
life
it
is
to
her
sex
that
the
wee
but
very
wise
folk
sometimes
delegate
their
power
of
torment
such
understudies
are
found
to
play
the
part
exceeding
well
and
many
a
time
the
infatuated
youth
believes
he
sees
in
the
depth
of
one
sole
pair
of
eyes
blue
brown
or
green
the
fairy
colour
the
authentic
fairy
wicket
standing
ajar
many
a
time
must
he
hear
the
quaint
old
formula
i
sure
if
i
ever
done
anything
to
lead
you
to
think
etc
runs
it
not
so
ere
he
shall
realise
that
here
is
the
gate
upon
no
magic
pleasance
but
on
a
cheap
suburban
villa
banging
behind
the
wrathful
or
hurled
open
to
speed
the
pallid
householder
to
the
registrar
office
in
still
grosser
habitations
too
they
lurk
do
the
people
of
mischief
ready
to
frolic
out
on
the
unsuspecting
one
as
in
the
case
which
still
haunts
my
memory
of
a
certain
bottle
of
an
historic
hued
like
venetian
glass
odorous
as
a
garden
in
june
forth
from
out
the
faint
perfume
of
this
haunted
drink
there
danced
a
bevy
from
old
france
clad
in
the
fashion
of
knots
of
ribbon
bedizening
velvets
as
they
moved
in
stately
wise
among
the
roses
of
the
old
garden
to
the
quaint
music
rameau
was
it
of
a
fairy
cornemuse
while
fairy
watteaus
fragonards
lancrets
sat
and
painted
them
alas
too
shallow
the
bottle
too
brief
the
brawls
not
to
be
recalled
by
any
quantity
of
green
chartreuse
aboard
the
galley
he
was
cruising
in
the
southern
seas
was
the
ulysses
who
told
me
this
tale
when
there
bore
down
upon
him
a
marvellous
strange
fleet
whose
like
he
had
not
before
seen
for
each
little
craft
was
a
corpse
stiffly
marlined
or
bound
about
with
tarred
rope
as
mariners
do
use
to
treat
plug
tobacco
also
ballasted
and
with
a
fair
mast
and
sail
stepped
through
his
midriff
these
ships
knew
no
divided
authority
no
pilot
ever
took
the
helm
from
the
hands
no
mutines
lay
in
bilboes
no
passengers
complained
of
the
provisions
in
a
certain
island
to
windward
the
native
pilot
explained
it
was
the
practice
when
a
man
died
to
bury
him
for
the
time
being
in
dry
desiccating
sand
till
a
chief
should
pass
from
his
people
when
the
waiting
bodies
were
brought
out
and
caulked
and
rigged
secumdum
artem
were
launched
with
the
first
fair
breeze
the
admiral
at
their
head
on
their
voyage
to
the
blessed
islands
and
if
a
chief
should
die
and
the
sand
should
hold
no
store
of
corpses
for
his
escort
this
simple
practical
folk
would
solve
the
little
difficulty
by
knocking
some
dozen
or
twenty
stout
fellows
on
the
head
that
the
notable
might
voyage
like
a
gentleman
whence
this
gallant
little
company
running
before
the
breeze
stark
happy
and
extinct
all
bound
for
the
isles
of
light
was
a
sight
to
shame
us
sitters
at
home
who
believe
in
those
islands
most
of
us
even
as
they
yet
are
content
to
trundle
or
to
margate
so
long
as
the
sorry
breath
is
in
us
and
breathless
at
last
to
bow
or
kensal
green
without
one
effort
dead
or
alive
to
reach

all

whatever

but
of
the

fettered
to
the

each
for
his

a
common

us

that

nothing
make

he

why
do

seize
on

fling
our

into
the
sea
and
steer
for
some
pleasant
isle
far
down
under

beyond

for

what

we

well
the

our

and
mayhap
we
like
them
none
the
worse
for

indeed
there
is
a

sort
among
ourselves
that
spins
facile
phrases
in
the
honour
of
these

of
ours
as
omnes

and
the
rest
which
is
all
very
pretty
and
mighty
consoling
the
fact
is
the
poets
are
the
only
people
who
score
by
the
present
arrangement
which
it
is
therefore
their
interest
to
maintain
while
we
are
doing
all
the
work
these
incorrigible
skulkers
lounge
about
and
make
ribald
remarks
they
write
greek
tragedies
on
fate
on
the
sublimity
of
suffering
on
the
petty
span
and
so
on
and
act
in
a
generally
offensive
way
and
we
are
even
weak
enough
to
buy
their
books
offer
them
drinks
peerages
and
things
and
say
what
superlative
fellows
they
are
but
when
the
combination
comes
and
we
poor
devils
have
risen
and
abolished
fate
destiny
the
olympian
council
early
baldness
and
the
like
these
poets
will
really
have
to
go
and
when
every
rhymester
has
walked
the
plank
shall
we
still
put
up
with
our
relations
true
members
of
the
stupid
party
who
never
believe
in
us
who
know
and
never
forget
the
follies
of
our
adolescence
who
are
always
wanting
us
not
to
do
things
who
are
lavish
of
advice
yet
angered
by
the
faintest
suggestion
of
a
small
advance
in
cash
shall
the
idle
singers
perish
and
these
endure
no
as
soon
as
the
last
poet
has
splashed
over
the
side
to
the
sharks
with
our
relations
the
old
barkey
is
lightening
famously
who
shall
be
next
to
go
the
sportsman
of
intolerable
yarns
who
slays
twice
over
first
his
game
and
then
the
miserable
being
he
for
the
tedious
recital
shall
we
suffer
him
longer
who
else
who
is
that
cowering
under
the
bulwarks
yonder
the
man
who
thinks
he
can
imitate
the
scottish
accent
splash
and
the
next
one
what
a
crowd
is
here
how
they
block
the
hatchways
lumber
the
deck
and
get
between
you
and
the
purser
room
these
fadmongers
teetotallers
missionaries
of
divers
isms
overboard
with
them
and
hey
for
the
fortunate
isles
then
for
tobacco
in
a
hammock
the
palms
then
for
wine
cooled
in
a
brooklet
losing
itself
in
silver
sands
then
for
but
o
these
bilboes
on
our
ankles
how
mercilessly
they
grip
the
vertical
sun
blisters
the
bare
back
faint
echoes
of
olympian
laughter
seem
to
flicker
like
northern
lights
across
the
stark
and
pitiless
sky
one
earnest
effort
would
do
it
my
brothers
a
little
modesty
a
short
sinking
of
private
differences
and
then
we
should
all
be
free
and
equal
gentlemen
of
fortune
and
i
would
be

you
you
would
make

scurvy
skulking
little
yourself
and
be
pull
together
boys
and
lie
low
here
the
master
coming
with
his
whip
the
lost
centaur
it
is
somewhere
set
down
or
does
the
legend
only
exist
in
the
great
volume
of
that
the
young
achilles
nurtured
from
babyhood
by
the
wise
and
kindly
cheiron
accustomed
to
reverence
an
ideal
of
human
skill
and
wisdom
blent
with
all
that
was
best
and
noblest
of
animal
instinct
strength
and
swiftness
found
poor
humanity
sadly
to
miss
when
at
last
the
was
sent
forth
among
his
pottering
little
peers
himself
alone
he
had
hitherto
fancied
to
be
the
maimed
one
the
incomplete
he
looked
to
find
the
lords
of
earth
even
such
as
these
centaurs
wise
and
magnanimous
atop
below
shod
with
the
lightning
winged
with
the
wind
terrible
in
the
potentiality
of
the
armed
heel
instead
of
which
how
fallen
was
his
first
fair
hope
of
the
world
and
even
when
reconciled
at
last
to
the
dynasty
of
the
forked
radish
after
he
had
seen
its
quality
tested
round
the
clangorous
walls
of
troy
some
touch
of
an
imperial
disdain
ever
lingered
in
his
mind
for
these
feeble
folk
who
could
contentedly
hail
him
him
who
had
known
cheiron
as
hero
and
lord
achilles
has
passed
with
the
centaurs
and
troy
but
the
feeling
lingers
of
strange
and
divers
strands
is
twisted
the
mysterious
cord
that
reaching
back
through
spaces
out
of
space
and
timeless
time
somewhere
joins
us
to
the
brute
a
twine
of
mingled
yarn
not
utterly
base
as
we
grow
from
our
animal
infancy
and
the
threads
snap
one
by
one
at
each
gallant
of
a
soul
poising
for
flight
into
empyrean
we
are
yet
conscious
of
a
loss
for
every
gain
we
have
some
forlorn
sense
of
a
vanished
heritage
willing
enough
are
we
to
let
the
ape
and
tiger
die
but
the
pleasant
cousins
dissembled
in
hide
and
fur
and
feather
are
not
all
tigers
and
apes
which
last
vile
folk
indeed
exist
for
us
only
in
and
chiefly
offend
by
always
carrying
the
sunday
school
ensign
of
a
moral
at
their
tails
others
happily
of
less
didactic
dispositions
there
be
and
it
is
to
these
unaffected
careless
companions
that
the
sensible
child
is
wont
to
devote
himself
leaving
severely
alone
the
stiff
tame
creatures
claiming
to
be
of
closer
kin
and
yet
these
playmates
while
cheerfully
admitting
him
of
their
fellowship
make
him
feel
his
inferiority
at
every
point
vainly
his
snub
nose
projected
earthwards
he
essays
to
sniff
it
with
the
terrier
who
as
becomes
the
nobler
animal
is
leading
in
the
chase
and
he
is
ready
to
weep
as
he
realises
his
loss
and
the
rest
of
the
free
company
the
pony
the
cows
the
great
are
ever
shaming
him
by
their
unboastful
exercise
of
some
enviable
and
unattainable
attribute
even
the
friendly
pig
who
did
but
parents
permit
should
eat
of
his
bread
and
drink
of
his
cup
and
be
unto
him
as
a
brother
which
among
all
these
unhappy
bifurcations
so
cheery
so
unambitious
so
purely
contented
so
apt
to
be
the
guide
philosopher
and
friend
of
boyhood
as
he
what
wonder
that
at
times
when
the
neophyte
in
life
begins
to
realise
that
all
these
desirable
accomplishments
have
had
to
be
surrendered
one
by
one
in
the
process
of
developing
a
mind
the
course
of
fitting
out
a
lord
of
creation
he
is
wont
not
knowing
the
extent
of
the
kingdom
to
which
he
is
heir
to
feel
a
little
discontented
ere
now
this
taking
root
in
a
nature
wherein
the
animal
is
already
ascendant
has
led
by
downward
paths
to
the
in
whom
the
submerged
human
system
peeps
out
but
fitfully
at
exalted
moments
he
the
peevish
and
irascible
shy
of
trodden
ways
and
pretty
domesticities
is
linked
to
us
by
little
but
his
love
of
melody
but
for
which
saving
grace
the
hair
would
soon
creep
up
from
thigh
to
horn
of
him
at
times
he
will
still
do
us
a
friendly
turn
will
lend
a
helping
hand
to
poor
little
psyche
wilfully
seeking
her
own
salvation
will
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
us
on
marathon
plain
but
in
the
main
his
sympathies
are
first
for
the
beast
to
which
his
horns
are
never
horrific
but
with
his
hairy
pelt
ever
natural
and
familiar
and
his
voice
with
its
talk
of
help
and
healing
not
harsh
nor
dissonant
but
voice
of
very
brother
as
well
as
very
god
and
this
declension
for
declension
it
is
though
we
achieve
all
the
confidences
of
melampus
and
even
master
with
him
the
pleasant
argot
of
the
woods
may
still
be
ours
if
we
suffer
what
lives
in
us
of
our
primal
cousins
to
draw
us
down
on
the
other
hand
let
soul
inform
and
irradiate
body
as
it
may
the
threads
are
utterly
shorn
asunder
never
nor
is
man
the
complete
the
permitted
to
cut
himself
wholly
adrift
from
these
his
poor
relations
the
mute
and
stunted
human
embryo
that
gazes
appealingly
from
out
the
depths
of
their
eyes
must
ever
remind
him
of
a
kinship
once
possibly
closer
nay
at
times
it
must
even
seem
to
whelm
him
in
reproach
as
thus
was
it
really
necessary
after
all
that
we
two
should
part
company
so
early
may
you
not
have
taken
a
wrong
turning
somewhere
in
your
long
race
after
your
progress
after
the
perfection
of
this
species
of
yours
a
turning
whose
due
avoidance
might
perhaps
have
resulted
in
no
such
lamentable
cleavage
as
is
here
but
in
some
perfect
embodiment
of
the
dual
nature
as
who
should
say
a
being
with
the
nobilities
of
both
of
us
the
basenesses
of
neither
so
might
you
more
fortunately
guided
have
been
led
at
last
up
the
green
sides
of
pelion
to
the
ancestral
the
primeval
centaur
still
waiting
majestic
on
the
summit
it
is
even
so
perhaps
this
thing
might
once
have
been
o
cousin
outcast
and
estranged
but
the
opportunity
was
long
since
lost
henceforth
two
ways
for
us
for
ever
orion
the
moonless
night
has
a
touch
of
frost
and
is
high
and
dominant
amidst
the
populations
of
the
sky
the
restless
and
the
steadfast
alike
hangs
the
great
plough
lit
with
a
hard
radiance
as
of
the
polished
and
shining
share
and
yonder
low
on
the
horizon
but
half
resurgent
as
yet
crouches
the
magnificent
hunter
watchful
seemingly
and
expectant
with
some
hint
of
menace
in
his
port
yet
should
his
game
be
up
you
would
think
by
now
many
a
century
has
passed
since
the
plough
first
sped
a
conqueror
east
and
west
clearing
forest
and
draining
fen
policing
the
valleys
with
and
sunday
schools
with
the
chains
that
are
forged
of
peace
the
irking
fetters
of
plenty
driving
also
the
whole
lot
of
us
these
to
sweat
at
its
tail
those
to
plod
with
the
patient
team
but
all
to
march
in
a
great
the
convicts
of
peace
and
order
and
law
while
the
happy
nomad
with
his
woodlands
his
wild
cattle
his
pleasing
nuptialities
has
long
since
disappeared
dropping
only
in
his
flight
some
store
of
a
legacy
of
confusion
truly
we
children
of
the
plough
but
for
yon
tremendous
monitor
in
the
sky
were
in
right
case
to
forget
that
the
hunter
is
still
a
quantity
to
reckon
withal
where
then
does
he
hide
the
shaker
of
the
spear
why
here
my
brother
and
here
deep
in
the
breasts
of
each
and
all
of
us
and
for
this
drop
of
primal
quicksilver
in
the
blood
what
poppy
or
mandragora
shall
purge
it
hence
away
of
pulpiteers
and
parents
it
is
called
original
sin
a
term
wherewith
they
brand
whatever
frisks
and
butts
with
rude
goatish
horns
against
accepted
maxims
and
trim
theories
of
education
in
the
abstract
of
course
this
fitful
stirring
of
the
old
yeast
is
no
more
sin
than
a
natural
craving
for
a
seat
on
a
high
stool
for
the
inscription
now
horizontal
and
now
vertical
of
figures
is
sin
but
the
deskmen
command
a
temporary
majority
for
the
short
while
they
shall
hold
the
cards
they
have
the
right
to
call
the
game
and
so
since
we
must
bow
to
the
storm
let
the
one
thing
be
labelled
sin
and
the
other
salvation
for
a
season
ourselves
forgetting
never
that
it
is
all
a
matter
of
nomenclature
what
we
have
now
first
to
note
is
that
this
original
waft
from
the
garden
asserts
itself
most
vigorously
in
the
child
this
it
is
that
thrusts
the
small
boy
out
under
the
naked
heavens
to
enact
a
sorry
and
shivering
crusoe
on
an
islet
in
the
this
it
is
that
sends
the
little
girl
footing
it
after
the
gipsy
van
oblivious
of
lessons
puddings
the
embrace
maternal
the
paternal
smack
hearing
naught
save
the
faint
far
to
the
little
savage
that
thrills
and
answers
in
the
tingling
blood
of
her
seeing
only
a
troop
of
dusky
guides
along
that
shining
highway
to
the
dim
land
east
o
the
sun
and
west
the
moon
where
freedom
is
and
you
can
wander
and
breathe
and
at
night
tame
street
lamps
there
are
none
only
the
hunter
fires
and
the
eyes
of
lions
and
the
mysterious
stars
in
later
years
it
is
stifled
and
gagged
buried
deep
a
green
turf
at
the
head
of
it
and
on
its
heart
a
stone
but
it
lives
it
breathes
it
lurks
it
will
up
and
out
when
is
looked
for
least
that
stockbroker
some
brief
summers
gone
who
was
missed
from
his
wonted
place
one
a
goodly
portly
man
i
faith
and
had
a
villa
and
a
steam
launch
at
surbiton
and
was
versed
in
the
esoteric
humours
of
the
house
who
could
have
thought
that
the
hunter
lay
hid
in
him
yet
after
many
weeks
they
found
him
in
a
wild
nook
of
hampshire
ragged
the
nocturnal
haystack
calling
aloud
from
his
frayed
and
duds
his
trousers
tucked
he
was
tickling
trout
with
godless
native
urchins
and
when
they
would
have
won
him
to
himself
with
honied
whispers
of
american
rails
he
answered
but
with
babble
of
green
fields
he
is
back
in
his
wonted
corner
now
quite
cured
apparently
and
tractable
and
yet
let
the
sun
shine
too
wantonly
in
throgmorton
street
let
an
errant
zephyr
quick
with
the
warm
south
fan
but
his
cheek
too
wooingly
on
his
way
to
the
station
and
will
he
not
once
more
snap
his
chain
and
away
ay
truly
and
next
time
he
will
not
be
caught
deans
have
danced
to
the
same
wild
piping
though
their
chapters
have
hushed
the
matter
up
even
duchesses
they
say
have
come
tripping
doon
the
stair
rapt
by
the
climbing
passion
from
their
surroundings
into
starlit
spaces
nay
ourselves
too
the
douce
respectable
mediocrities
that
we
are
which
of
us
but
might
recall
some
fearful
outbreak
whose
details
are
mercifully
unknown
to
the
household
that
calls
us
breadwinner
and
chief
what
marvel
that
up
yonder
the
hunter
smiles
when
he
knows
that
every
one
in
his
ken
the
tinker
with
the
statesman
has
caught
his
bugle
blast
and
gone
forth
on
its
irresistible
appeal
not
that
they
are
so
easily
followed
as
of
yore
those
flying
echoes
of
the
horn
joints
are
stiffer
maybe
certainly
the
desolate
suburbs
creep
ever
farther
into
the
retreating
fields
and
when
you
reach
the
windy
moorland
lo
it
is
all
staked
out
into
mud
is
muddier
now
than
heretofore
and
ruts
are
ruttier
and
what
friendless
old
beast
comes
limping
down
the
dreary
lane
he
seems
sorely
shrunk
and
but
by
the
something
of
divinity
in
his
look
still
more
than
by
the
wings
despondent
along
his
mighty
sides
is
ever
the
old
pegasus
not
yet
the
knacker
own
hard
times
been
having
he
murmurs
as
you
rub
his
nose
these
fellows
have
really
no
seat
except
for
a
park
hack
as
for
this
laurel
we
were
wont
to
await
it
trembling
and
in
taking
it
we
were
afraid
your
english
way
of
hunting
it
down
with
yelpings
and
hallooings
well
i
may
be
out
of
date
but
we
would
have
stood
that
sort
of
thing
on
helicon
so
he
hobbles
down
the
road
good
night
old
fellow
out
of
date
well
it
may
be
so
and
alas
the
blame
is
ours
but
for
the
hunter
there
he
rises
couchant
no
more
nay
flung
full
stretch
on
the
blue
he
blazes
he
dominates
he
appals
will
his
turn
then
really
come
at
last
after
some
armageddon
of
cataclysmal
ruin
all
levelling
whelming
the
county
councillor
with
the
artiste
obliterating
the
very
furrows
of
the
plough
shall
the
nomad
string
his
bow
once
more
and
once
more
loose
the
whistling
shaft
wildly
incredible
it
seems
and
yet
look
up
look
up
and
behold
him
confident
erect
majestic
there
on
the
threshold
of
the
sky
